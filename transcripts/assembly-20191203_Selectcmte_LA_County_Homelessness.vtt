WEBVTT

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:14.381
I thank you for

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:15.014
everybody coming here this is-

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:18.685
the first select committee on

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:19.352
homelessness for LA county that

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.722
were hosting- here in Los

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:23.323
Angeles- we wanted to do it

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.857
here in Skid Row not just

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:26.659
because I represent the

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:27.260
district are because we wanted

00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:30.797
to we wanted to make the point

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:35.368
about how urgent this issue is

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:36.002
not the- remedy would agree. On

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.636
it is the number one issue on

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:39.072
people's minds when you walk

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.639
out of the street. It is the

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:40.173
number one issue on on our

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.640
conscience and in the

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:43.443
legislature we tried over the

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.077
years to address this issue.

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:47.480
Now we are very clear from the

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:48.014
beginning that this is not

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:48.581
gonna be an exercise in and

00:00:48.648 --> 00:00:49.149
finger pointing but I think

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.851
it's fair to say that. At this

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:52.552
point in time- that some of the

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:55.855
decade old policies that we

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:56.389
have put in place are no

00:00:56.456 --> 00:01:00.026
longer- affected were working-

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:00.660
today. And I think it's fair to

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:01.261
say that if we continue down

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:04.364
that path. We're going to

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:04.931
continue to see- the results

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:05.498
that we just currently seem

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:08.301
like an explosion homelessness-

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:08.935
twelve in and 16% respectively

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:13.006
from city and county I think we

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:16.810
have to accept that fact. On in

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:17.444
part of what we're doing today.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.044
Is beginning larger ever say

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:20.780
about. About coordination-

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:21.414
resources the best ideas what

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:25.185
works what doesn't work. On an

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:25.819
understanding that that today's

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:26.453
a new day so. The things that

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:29.289
we would have not talked about

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:29.923
in the past. As acceptable the

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:30.523
public policy. Except in today

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.564
because- we can no longer on.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.198
We can longer avoid. The issue

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:38.731
homelessness and we can no

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:42.068
longer- be complacent about.

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:42.702
Not have that sort of sense of

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:43.303
urgency and all. All on echo

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.139
what my colleague could set. A

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:46.806
few weeks ago- Bob Hertzberg at

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:50.243
a press conference I center Bob

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.910
Hertzberg and he said. When he

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:54.280
went up to speak he said it. I

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:54.881
think you said three words he

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:55.448
said urgency urgency urgency

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:58.518
and then some more urgency. And

00:01:58.585 --> 00:01:59.085
then walked up I think the

00:01:59.152 --> 00:01:59.719
point that we were trying to

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:02.755
make at that time. What was

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:03.356
that we have to address it at

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:07.060
this point in time. And we want

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:07.660
to break the old paradigms we

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:11.097
want to take a look at new ways

00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:11.664
of doing it. And we've good.

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:12.232
Earth but we've got to do a

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:15.568
little bit better could. I we

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:16.169
had we've had great. Success

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:16.803
working with the city we've had

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.639
great success working with the

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:20.240
county- philanthropic groups

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:23.776
business. Groups but we've got

00:02:23.843 --> 00:02:27.780
to do it a little bit. A little

00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:31.818
bit differently I would say-

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:32.352
let me share in an and I

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:32.986
promise I will be as long down

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:35.989
the line a by this issue. One

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:36.589
of the reasons why this issue

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:37.156
so important what struck me.

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:37.724
And I've said this a couple

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.358
times. When I first got elected

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:40.393
to the legislature. I was happy

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.027
go lucky as anybody could ever

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:44.330
be. You get elected you get a

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:44.998
call from the speak your member

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:45.632
those days right. And you get a

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:48.401
call from speaker everybody's

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:49.035
got that call and said Hey come

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:49.636
on up we want to discuss which

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:52.605
want to serve on. Out happy.

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:56.809
And on my way to the airport

00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:57.443
that one particular day it just

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.114
so happened. That he had

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.681
stopped at a corner and was

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:02.315
right good right. Nice to look

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:05.385
right down the street on in the

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:06.019
arts district so. You could see

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:09.455
homelessness when you walked

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:10.056
outside of a house. The what

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:13.493
was unique about this time it

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.127
was a lot there was a lady. And

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:14.727
a small baby. And the baby was

00:03:14.794 --> 00:03:17.897
in a stroller. And people tell

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:18.464
us that there are no kids on

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:19.032
the street there are kids on

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:21.935
the street. We'll see them. And

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:22.569
the baby was trying to grab the

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:26.272
mom's attention. And you could

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.906
imagine and now we've all seen

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:30.209
this picture or this image. And

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:30.810
the longer the baby tried to

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:31.444
grab the mother's attention it

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:34.714
seemed to me that that that

00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:35.281
that light had gone forever.

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:38.651
And all I could remember. And

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:42.622
it haunts me to this date of

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:43.156
what could happen of that

00:03:43.222 --> 00:03:43.790
child. And one of those tents.

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:44.290
What could have child is

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:46.893
somebody given that person help.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.460
And what more could we have

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:51.464
done. And it's at that sort of

00:03:51.531 --> 00:03:55.401
sense of urgency. But I want to

00:03:55.468 --> 00:03:56.035
start this hearing. And we'll

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:59.639
get we'll have time for an

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:00.273
overview but what I really want

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.873
to do right now it is handed

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:07.747
over my colleagues and then.

00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:08.348
Say one word to spend she in

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:08.915
which I've got his political

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:11.985
many got shown giving you don't

00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:16.022
notable que esta. Es de temas

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.623
of them a must import on the

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:17.223
guest on will be under a kia

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.693
and California handicap even

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.430
ask I guess to some but I seem

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:25.064
to be the end. You look at some

00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:28.601
of that bundle that said I key.

00:04:28.668 --> 00:04:29.202
Is that that equity not most

00:04:29.268 --> 00:04:32.939
roles. As what was will keep

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:33.539
them at hold in also lamented

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:37.243

Sawyer I too am. Happy to be

00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:46.305
here you know. In the nineteen

00:06:46.372 --> 00:06:46.906
ninety five ninety six I was a

00:06:46.973 --> 00:06:47.473
middle aged system W. mayor

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.810
which is C. of Los Angeles when

00:06:50.877 --> 00:06:54.614
we're talking about Lhasa. And

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.181
Natalie Kerr creating a bit

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:55.715
making it better. And the

00:06:55.782 --> 00:06:58.718
solutions I don't think it

00:06:58.785 --> 00:06:59.318
changed nineteen ninety five-

00:06:59.385 --> 00:07:03.222
many of it may just have been

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:03.823
our inability to implement a

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:04.423
lot of things and so I'm I'm

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.560
here to listen to the experts.

00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:08.227
On how not not only just how we

00:07:08.294 --> 00:07:08.895
implement them but how quickly.

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:11.597
We can get this done because I

00:07:11.664 --> 00:07:12.231
don't think we need to we have

00:07:12.298 --> 00:07:12.832
to problem anymore we need to

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:15.568
just have a focus like a laser

00:07:15.635 --> 00:07:16.169
discussion order on solutions

00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:19.672
and how we can quickly

00:10:11.344 --> 00:10:14.680
their children and how can we

00:11:05.231 --> 00:11:09.135
I've spent my whole life. As an

00:11:09.201 --> 00:11:17.309
organizer with low wage workers

00:11:17.376 --> 00:11:17.943
trying to help them get better

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:21.614
for weight higher wages so that

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.651
they don't end up homeless the

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:29.889
end up on the streets. I am

00:11:29.955 --> 00:11:30.423
really concerned about the

00:11:30.489 --> 00:11:31.023
seven fifty thousand families

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:31.557
who wore a severely over

00:11:31.624 --> 00:11:34.360
burdened. With the percentage

00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:34.894
of rent that they pay from

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.397
their income so what we have

00:11:38.464 --> 00:11:42.601
to. Our first and most urgent

00:11:42.668 --> 00:11:43.102
task is our sisters and

00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:46.672
brothers and children who live

00:11:46.739 --> 00:11:50.709
on the streets- we cannot.

00:11:50.776 --> 00:11:54.780
Address that issue their issues

00:11:54.847 --> 00:11:55.347
if we don't also addressed

00:11:55.414 --> 00:11:59.385
those who Daly become homeless

00:11:59.452 --> 00:12:03.189

00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:43.215
follow along. In the report as

00:14:43.282 --> 00:14:46.051
well if that helps. Okay it's

00:14:46.118 --> 00:14:50.389
not the. Yeah really work in

00:14:50.456 --> 00:14:58.564
here. There it is okay so- all

00:14:58.631 --> 00:15:02.735
this is really about- counting

00:15:02.801 --> 00:15:03.335
the number of homelessness is

00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:03.902
it is a challenge this is a

00:15:03.969 --> 00:15:06.972
little bit- in the weeds of the

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:07.573
methods but just so that you

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:08.140
know. The medical examiner

00:15:08.207 --> 00:15:11.143
corner investigates the

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:11.777
majority of homeless deaths and

00:15:11.844 --> 00:15:12.344
does collect information on

00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:15.381
homelessness death certificates

00:15:15.447 --> 00:15:16.015
don't collecting information on

00:15:16.081 --> 00:15:19.151
homelessness so we did a fair

00:15:19.218 --> 00:15:19.718
amount of- hard hard work

00:15:19.785 --> 00:15:20.252
digging deeper into the

00:15:20.319 --> 00:15:23.589
mortality data from the state

00:15:23.656 --> 00:15:24.223
and from the corner to- to get

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:27.926
a better count of the homeless

00:15:27.993 --> 00:15:28.494
does which is part in itself

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.730
so- we are able to identify

00:15:31.797 --> 00:15:32.364
seven hundred additional missed

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:32.931
us that that would not have

00:15:32.998 --> 00:15:36.168
been. Found just based on the

00:15:36.235 --> 00:15:36.802
most basic information from the

00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:44.710
corner. So let me jump to the

00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:45.344
data here so. Over the past six

00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:48.881
years this is figure shows the

00:15:48.947 --> 00:15:49.481
homeless population has been-

00:15:49.548 --> 00:15:52.751
the mortality death among the

00:15:52.818 --> 00:15:53.352
homeless population has been

00:15:53.419 --> 00:15:53.919
rising- from. Five hundred

00:15:53.986 --> 00:15:54.453
thirty six total deaths in

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.989
twenty thirteen. Two thousand

00:15:57.056 --> 00:16:01.093
forty seven deaths in twenty

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:01.694
eighteen that's the number of

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.361
deaths but- the actual rate of

00:16:02.428 --> 00:16:05.197
deaths which counts for the

00:16:05.264 --> 00:16:05.798
increase in the population of

00:16:05.864 --> 00:16:09.468
homeless. Folks has increased

00:16:09.535 --> 00:16:10.102
by over a third adopting that

00:16:10.169 --> 00:16:10.703
same time period so it's not

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:13.339
just the number that's

00:16:13.405 --> 00:16:13.972
increasing at the rate. Of per

00:16:14.039 --> 00:16:17.609
population- it's increasing in

00:16:17.676 --> 00:16:18.210
terms of almost desk and just

00:16:18.277 --> 00:16:22.247
to just to might to close. Yeah

00:16:22.314 --> 00:16:26.251
okay. There yeah. And just what

00:16:26.318 --> 00:16:30.189
is a perspective- in two

00:16:30.255 --> 00:16:30.823
thousand eighteen New York City

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:31.457
had about the same number of

00:16:31.523 --> 00:16:34.360
homeless in their count- but

00:16:34.426 --> 00:16:34.993
only had two hundred and ninety

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:35.527
deaths in two hundred and

00:16:35.594 --> 00:16:38.630
eighteen compared to in two

00:16:38.697 --> 00:16:39.231
thousand eighteen compared to

00:16:39.298 --> 00:16:39.832
bar. Are thousand forty seven

00:16:39.898 --> 00:16:42.901
the next thing we did was. To

00:16:42.968 --> 00:16:43.469
try to figure out what was

00:16:43.535 --> 00:16:44.036
causing this increase in

00:16:44.103 --> 00:16:47.072
mortality rate- so we were able

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:51.043
to link the corner dated to-

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.643
causes of death in our death

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:52.144
records. And this slide

00:16:52.211 --> 00:16:55.414
basically shows the two leading

00:16:55.481 --> 00:16:56.014
causes of death among people

00:16:56.081 --> 00:16:56.615
experiencing homelessness. Of

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:59.618
the top two causes by you know

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:00.252
by consider margin or coronary

00:17:00.319 --> 00:17:00.819
heart disease and drug and

00:17:00.886 --> 00:17:03.655
alcohol overdose- Corey heart

00:17:03.722 --> 00:17:07.726
disease- indicative of the

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:08.293
aging of our our homeless

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:08.927
population this is a phenomenal

00:17:08.994 --> 00:17:09.495
it's happening nationally as

00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:12.297
well- drug and alcohol- 88% of

00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:16.168
those were words. Were drugs

00:17:16.235 --> 00:17:16.835
versus alcohol- also in the top

00:17:16.902 --> 00:17:20.272
five leading causes were

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:20.906
transportation related injuries

00:17:20.973 --> 00:17:21.473
and- but 82% of those were

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.843
among pedestrians and cyclists

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:29.048
so. And then also homicide and

00:17:29.114 --> 00:17:29.715
suicide and then we see little

00:17:29.782 --> 00:17:32.651
differences across- gender and

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:33.185
racial ethnic groups for

00:17:33.252 --> 00:17:33.652
example- among African

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:37.189
Americans corny heart disease

00:17:37.256 --> 00:17:37.723
is a lot higher than. Drug

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:38.290
overdose among Latinos drug

00:17:38.357 --> 00:17:41.293
overdose little higher than

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:41.927
corner heart disease also among

00:17:41.994 --> 00:17:45.531
females- drug overdose of the

00:17:45.597 --> 00:17:46.165
higher than than coronary heart

00:17:46.231 --> 00:17:49.501
disease. Next we look at. The

00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:50.169
trends over time this again is

00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:53.939
accounting for- changes in the

00:17:54.006 --> 00:17:54.406
total number of people

00:17:54.473 --> 00:17:55.007
experiencing homelessness and

00:17:55.073 --> 00:17:58.143
county. And what pops out. In

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:01.880
this figure is- the two highest

00:18:01.947 --> 00:18:02.448
naturally the corner heart

00:18:02.514 --> 00:18:05.984
disease and drug overdose heart

00:18:06.051 --> 00:18:06.618
disease which is the red line

00:18:06.685 --> 00:18:07.219
is relatively stable so it's

00:18:07.286 --> 00:18:10.422
high but not really

00:18:10.489 --> 00:18:11.023
contributing to this increase

00:18:11.089 --> 00:18:11.657
that were saying so. The real-

00:18:11.723 --> 00:18:14.493
the biggest the take home

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:15.127
here's the biggest because it's

00:18:15.194 --> 00:18:15.694
contributing to the increase

00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:18.831
almost more tell is that the

00:18:18.897 --> 00:18:19.364
drug and alcohol overdoses

00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:22.935
also- the- transportation

00:18:23.001 --> 00:18:23.502
related injuries as the blue

00:18:23.569 --> 00:18:24.136
line that's doubled and have so

00:18:24.203 --> 00:18:27.206
is homicide is also doubled in

00:18:27.272 --> 00:18:31.109
the past six years. So between.

00:18:31.176 --> 00:18:35.180
Between overdose deaths-

00:18:35.247 --> 00:18:35.714
transportation related and

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:39.685
homicide that's- those are the

00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:40.285
those of the causes that are

00:18:40.352 --> 00:18:40.786
contributing most to the

00:18:40.853 --> 00:18:43.689
overall increase. Next week

00:18:43.755 --> 00:18:44.323
because we have information-

00:18:44.389 --> 00:18:48.160
from loss said they do a really

00:18:48.227 --> 00:18:48.760
good job not only of doing a

00:18:48.827 --> 00:18:49.361
home with count but they also

00:18:49.428 --> 00:18:52.231
do an estimate of the of this

00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:52.598
is a demographic

00:18:52.664 --> 00:18:53.232
characteristics of the homeless

00:18:53.298 --> 00:18:56.401
population were actually able

00:18:56.468 --> 00:18:56.935
to compare for three years

00:18:57.002 --> 00:18:57.369
because we had these

00:18:57.436 --> 00:19:00.572
demographic data for twenty

00:19:00.639 --> 00:19:01.206
sixteen through twenty eighteen

00:19:01.273 --> 00:19:04.376
we're actually able to compare-

00:19:04.443 --> 00:19:04.877
mortality rates among.

00:19:04.943 --> 00:19:05.511
Different racial ethnic groups

00:19:05.577 --> 00:19:08.647
of the homeless population- two

00:19:08.714 --> 00:19:09.248
things stand out here one is.

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:12.885
Across all three years the way

00:19:12.951 --> 00:19:13.485
homeless population mortality

00:19:13.552 --> 00:19:14.019
rate is higher the African

00:19:14.086 --> 00:19:17.222
American and Latino- rates that

00:19:17.289 --> 00:19:21.159
might at first single car

00:19:21.226 --> 00:19:21.793
intuitive given that given how

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:22.394
much- how over represented.

00:19:22.461 --> 00:19:25.364
African Americans are in the

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.998
actual homeless population but

00:19:26.064 --> 00:19:26.632
this is something that's been

00:19:26.698 --> 00:19:29.835
found actually in in research

00:19:29.902 --> 00:19:30.435
around the country it's not a

00:19:30.502 --> 00:19:33.906
new finding and the though the

00:19:33.972 --> 00:19:34.473
running theory although its

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:38.143
it's- the theory. Is that- the

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:38.710
antecedents to homelessness

00:19:38.777 --> 00:19:42.381
among whites verses- African

00:19:42.447 --> 00:19:42.915
Americans may be a little

00:19:42.981 --> 00:19:46.151
different. With weights- being

00:19:46.218 --> 00:19:46.818
more likely become homeless due

00:19:46.885 --> 00:19:47.452
to severe physical and mental

00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:50.589
health issues where as- African

00:19:50.656 --> 00:19:51.089
Americans- experiencing-

00:19:51.156 --> 00:19:54.593
economic hardship. And racism

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:58.697
and discrimination so the

00:19:58.764 --> 00:19:59.331
they're being that that white

00:19:59.398 --> 00:19:59.932
people. Reach a threshold of

00:19:59.998 --> 00:20:02.935
illness that's greater and

00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:03.569
there are therefore have higher

00:20:03.635 --> 00:20:04.102
mortality rates when they

00:20:04.169 --> 00:20:07.105
become homeless- also what

00:20:07.172 --> 00:20:07.739
you're seeing here is that the

00:20:07.806 --> 00:20:08.407
rates going down for whites but

00:20:08.473 --> 00:20:11.276
it's going up for African

00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:15.414
Americans and Latinos. That's

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.651
mmhm. You can this is just data

00:20:19.718 --> 00:20:23.622
data just give you ideas for.

00:20:23.689 --> 00:20:24.189
For a policies one potential

00:20:24.256 --> 00:20:24.756
this might be happening if

00:20:24.823 --> 00:20:28.226
indeed. You know the profile of

00:20:28.293 --> 00:20:28.794
what homeless folks is that

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:29.461
their sicker and therefore more

00:20:29.528 --> 00:20:29.928
likely to screen into-

00:20:29.995 --> 00:20:32.331
permanent supportive housing

00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:32.931
that's potentially reason why

00:20:32.998 --> 00:20:33.532
the rates might be going down

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:36.535
for whites but- again we're in

00:20:36.602 --> 00:20:37.135
we're in communication with

00:20:37.202 --> 00:20:40.606
the- with the Lhasa who's done

00:20:40.672 --> 00:20:41.239
a whole. Report and task force

00:20:41.306 --> 00:20:44.509
on African Americans

00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:45.110
experiencing homelessness and

00:20:45.177 --> 00:20:45.544
so we're- kind of.

00:20:45.611 --> 00:20:46.178
Investigating this a little bit

00:20:46.244 --> 00:20:53.318
more. Next we also compared by

00:20:53.385 --> 00:20:53.952
gender- the rates are going up

00:20:54.019 --> 00:20:57.155
for both males and females a

00:20:57.222 --> 00:20:57.723
little bit more rapidly for

00:20:57.789 --> 00:21:01.326
females especially during the

00:21:01.393 --> 00:21:01.893
first year- but again rates

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:02.527
higher overall for males versus

00:21:02.594 --> 00:21:09.668
females. This slide is a

00:21:09.735 --> 00:21:10.235
comparison of rates just a

00:21:10.302 --> 00:21:10.869
simple comparison of the rates

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:14.072
of people experiencing

00:21:14.139 --> 00:21:14.706
homelessness verses the general

00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:15.374
population of LA county just to

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.343
give you a sense of the- of the

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:18.877
magnitude of the of the

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:26.318
problem. So for all causes.

00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:26.752
People experiencing

00:21:26.818 --> 00:21:30.422
homelessness- had a mortality

00:21:30.489 --> 00:21:30.956
rate two point three times

00:21:31.023 --> 00:21:31.456
higher than the general

00:21:31.523 --> 00:21:32.057
population. Which is a little

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:34.760
lower than what we've seen

00:21:34.826 --> 00:21:35.394
another of in the literature

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.028
although most of those studies

00:21:36.094 --> 00:21:36.595
are from the northeast other

00:21:36.662 --> 00:21:39.064
countries that have different-

00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:39.698
homeless population so this is

00:21:39.765 --> 00:21:43.135
probably an indication of just

00:21:43.201 --> 00:21:43.802
the sheer size and diversity of

00:21:43.869 --> 00:21:47.005
our homeless population here.

00:21:47.072 --> 00:21:47.606
But what's most striking here

00:21:47.673 --> 00:21:48.240
is that a for the fight leading

00:21:48.306 --> 00:21:48.807
cause of death the it's of

00:21:48.874 --> 00:21:51.677
mortality for the homeless or

00:21:51.743 --> 00:21:52.277
between three and twenty six

00:21:52.344 --> 00:21:55.547
times higher than than for the

00:21:55.614 --> 00:21:56.048
general population most

00:21:56.114 --> 00:21:56.682
striking being drug and alcohol

00:21:56.748 --> 00:22:00.085
over does that's what we found

00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:03.722
that more top twenty six times

00:22:03.789 --> 00:22:04.322
higher. For homeless compared

00:22:04.389 --> 00:22:08.026
to the general population.

00:22:08.093 --> 00:22:08.593
Chance lead injuries on the

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:09.227
increase also. Ten times higher

00:22:09.294 --> 00:22:09.795
homicide ten times higher as

00:22:09.861 --> 00:22:16.501
well. This is a map we've begun

00:22:16.568 --> 00:22:17.135
mapping these does these this

00:22:17.202 --> 00:22:17.736
doesn't apology doesn't show

00:22:17.803 --> 00:22:20.706
the furthest north part of the

00:22:20.772 --> 00:22:21.373
county- Lancaster is also a hot

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.976
spot- we're doing some hard

00:22:25.043 --> 00:22:25.610
going Elsie's we've identified

00:22:25.677 --> 00:22:28.814
about- twenty communities

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.381
where- where almost S. are

00:22:29.448 --> 00:22:33.051
concentrating- and this

00:22:33.118 --> 00:22:33.585
analysis is part of a- a

00:22:33.652 --> 00:22:37.422
initiative really that were

00:22:37.489 --> 00:22:37.989
we've launched here in LA

00:22:38.056 --> 00:22:38.523
county to try to prevent

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:39.157
homeless deaths and doing we're

00:22:39.224 --> 00:22:41.760
also going to be doing some

00:22:41.827 --> 00:22:45.430
more fine grained- geo coding

00:22:45.497 --> 00:22:45.964
of deaths within those hot

00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:50.001
spots to try to figure out

00:22:50.068 --> 00:22:50.602
where where they're happening

00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:51.203
so that we can prevent them.

00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:54.072
And this is my- the room the

00:22:54.139 --> 00:22:54.706
recommendations of the lot of

00:22:54.773 --> 00:22:55.307
these are already being acted

00:22:55.373 --> 00:22:58.176
on again here in Los Angeles

00:22:58.243 --> 00:22:58.777
county as part of an effort

00:22:58.844 --> 00:22:59.411
across our health agency in and

00:22:59.478 --> 00:23:02.481
other other. Other agencies in

00:23:02.547 --> 00:23:06.551
our county. One is we're

00:23:06.618 --> 00:23:07.119
working with the corner to

00:23:07.185 --> 00:23:07.786
establish a almost death review

00:23:07.853 --> 00:23:08.353
panel we're learning from

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.922
similar efforts in New York New

00:23:10.989 --> 00:23:11.523
York City. To figure out just

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:14.926
to take samplings of folks

00:23:14.993 --> 00:23:15.560
who've died of different causes

00:23:15.627 --> 00:23:16.061
to understand the- the

00:23:16.128 --> 00:23:19.097
circumstances better to help

00:23:19.164 --> 00:23:19.631
prevent. The deaths we're

00:23:19.698 --> 00:23:20.232
conducting missional a survey

00:23:20.298 --> 00:23:23.301
research from the homeless

00:23:23.368 --> 00:23:23.935
population we were care harbor

00:23:24.002 --> 00:23:24.503
a couple weeks ago and we're

00:23:24.569 --> 00:23:27.372
doing. We're with the street

00:23:27.439 --> 00:23:27.973
average teams now collecting

00:23:28.039 --> 00:23:28.540
information from homeless

00:23:28.607 --> 00:23:31.343
individuals and from service

00:23:31.409 --> 00:23:31.910
providers. To get some more

00:23:31.977 --> 00:23:32.544
insights on reasons. For this-

00:23:32.611 --> 00:23:35.881
increase in mortality- we're

00:23:35.947 --> 00:23:40.051
looking into. Also we want to

00:23:40.118 --> 00:23:43.922
see what the moderates are

00:23:43.989 --> 00:23:44.456
people have been recently

00:23:44.523 --> 00:23:45.090
housed because those are that's

00:23:45.157 --> 00:23:45.657
a that's that's important as

00:23:45.724 --> 00:23:48.260
well. We want to. With the

00:23:48.326 --> 00:23:52.430
vision zero folks are looking

00:23:52.497 --> 00:23:52.998
to reduce traffic fatalities

00:23:53.064 --> 00:23:53.598
given that this such a- acute

00:23:53.665 --> 00:23:56.601
problem with a with the

00:23:56.668 --> 00:23:57.202
homeless in terms of traffic

00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.836
fatalities. We wanna a tailor

00:23:57.903 --> 00:24:00.839
some strategies there. And that

00:24:00.906 --> 00:24:01.439
we would just generally want

00:24:01.506 --> 00:24:04.910
to. Improve and refine our

00:24:04.976 --> 00:24:05.577
methods for on going monitoring

00:24:05.644 --> 00:24:09.047
up almost mortality. And that's

00:24:09.114 --> 00:24:09.581
said that's all I have for

00:24:09.648 --> 00:24:13.084
today thank you very much.

00:24:13.151 --> 00:24:13.552
Thank you when you we

00:24:13.618 --> 00:24:17.355
appreciate the. The

00:24:17.422 --> 00:24:21.326
presentation I know we're

00:24:21.393 --> 00:24:21.960
missing a speaker but how about

00:24:22.027 --> 00:24:22.627
if I jump in the questions from

00:24:22.694 --> 00:24:23.228
the committee members if there

00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:29.801
are any

00:24:33.972 --> 00:24:34.206
. And reminding

00:24:34.272 --> 00:24:34.773
everybody the strikes. The

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.310
Hertzberg comment urgency

00:24:38.376 --> 00:24:42.280
urgency

00:24:46.518 --> 00:24:46.885
. Well let me let me ask

00:24:46.952 --> 00:24:47.519
a couple questions- and in the

00:24:47.586 --> 00:24:48.019
meantime and- just to be

00:24:48.086 --> 00:24:50.589
provocative a little bit if.

00:24:50.655 --> 00:24:54.960
There wasn't Barack or see we

00:24:55.026 --> 00:24:55.427
didn't have all these

00:24:55.493 --> 00:24:56.094
regulations etcetera what would

00:24:56.161 --> 00:24:59.297
you proposes an immediate step.

00:24:59.364 --> 00:25:03.501
To address- the mortality rate

00:25:03.568 --> 00:25:04.102
total out the box are a little

00:25:04.169 --> 00:25:11.710
would you right now. What we're

00:25:11.776 --> 00:25:12.344
trying to get people house but

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:15.881
in the meantime there's still

00:25:15.947 --> 00:25:16.514
dying before their houses so I

00:25:16.581 --> 00:25:20.218
would say shelter- temporary

00:25:20.285 --> 00:25:28.326
shelter in it yeah. On the

00:25:28.393 --> 00:25:28.894
question because we have our

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.494
speaker who's right okay with

00:25:29.561 --> 00:25:32.831
open. And Theresa Winkler high

00:25:32.898 --> 00:25:33.298
you're here as a- as a

00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:40.872
testimonial right. Yeah on the

00:25:40.939 --> 00:25:41.506
on the need to have urgency so

00:25:41.573 --> 00:25:42.107
we appreciate your time thank

00:25:42.173 --> 00:25:48.947
you very much. Yeah a of about

00:25:49.014 --> 00:25:53.385
as a thank you okay is. My name

00:25:53.451 --> 00:25:57.355
is sherry swindler and I was

00:25:57.422 --> 00:25:57.923
formally homeless. I've been

00:25:57.989 --> 00:26:01.559
in- affordable housing now for.

00:26:01.626 --> 00:26:05.997
Over ten years and by the in an

00:26:06.064 --> 00:26:06.598
affordable housing I was able

00:26:06.665 --> 00:26:10.168
to address. Until illness

00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:14.172
substance abuse and- just the.

00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:22.580
Chronic pains- the mind body

00:26:22.647 --> 00:26:26.685
and soul and spirit. I feel

00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:30.822
that it. There were more

00:26:30.889 --> 00:26:34.960
shelters and affordable housing.

00:26:35.026 --> 00:26:35.527
More people would be able to

00:26:35.593 --> 00:26:39.331
survive. Not only just

00:26:39.397 --> 00:26:39.898
physically but they will be

00:26:39.965 --> 00:26:43.468
able to grow. Productively and

00:26:43.535 --> 00:26:47.505
become better people because

00:26:47.572 --> 00:26:52.043
I'll. She by giving a person

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:56.081
just sat house it's not a home

00:26:56.147 --> 00:26:56.648
show they don't. They don't

00:26:56.715 --> 00:27:00.218
want to thrive. But when you're

00:27:00.285 --> 00:27:00.885
be when they're able to address

00:27:00.952 --> 00:27:01.486
the issues that they have on

00:27:01.553 --> 00:27:04.489
hand- medically and mentally.

00:27:04.556 --> 00:27:12.697
Well to well okay because I the

00:27:12.764 --> 00:27:13.331
median understand I had mental

00:27:13.398 --> 00:27:13.932
issues or physical issues in

00:27:13.999 --> 00:27:16.701
the last ten years have been

00:27:16.768 --> 00:27:17.235
able to address my mental

00:27:17.302 --> 00:27:21.239
issues. My health is to improve

00:27:21.306 --> 00:27:25.043
job 100% because I've be

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:29.247
hepatitis C. I have no. I have

00:27:29.314 --> 00:27:29.781
no longer life changing

00:27:29.848 --> 00:27:33.651
diseases thank goodness- and

00:27:33.718 --> 00:27:37.589
when I was homeless for almost

00:27:37.655 --> 00:27:38.256
twenty five years I wasn't safe

00:27:38.323 --> 00:27:41.826
I was in my active drug

00:27:41.893 --> 00:27:42.394
addiction I was. Excuse my

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:45.897
language I was process to for

00:27:45.964 --> 00:27:46.498
over twenty five years and it

00:27:46.564 --> 00:27:50.168
was a side. Show by the grace

00:27:50.235 --> 00:27:54.172
and mercy of a loving god. He's

00:27:54.239 --> 00:27:54.806
sitting here to testify about

00:27:54.873 --> 00:27:58.643
it you know so I feel that if

00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:59.277
you had more shelters and more

00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:02.714
how affordable housing they

00:28:02.781 --> 00:28:06.618
gave wraparound services.

00:28:06.684 --> 00:28:10.855
People can thrive and grow. I

00:28:10.922 --> 00:28:11.456
think that's five minutes. I

00:28:11.523 --> 00:28:15.193
appreciate your- your

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:15.794
presentation I want to take it

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:19.531
back to. Q. a please Mister

00:28:19.597 --> 00:28:23.802
Sawyer. Thank you at and I have

00:28:23.868 --> 00:28:27.472
my good friend and former state

00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:28.073
senator- Kevin Murray who who

00:28:28.139 --> 00:28:31.709
is present executive director

00:28:31.776 --> 00:28:32.343
CEO of the wind are center in

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:36.081
the back and- he mentioned to

00:28:36.147 --> 00:28:36.614
me it up this term called-

00:28:36.681 --> 00:28:40.218
service resistant. That no

00:28:40.285 --> 00:28:40.819
matter how much we put stuff

00:28:40.885 --> 00:28:41.252
out there. There are

00:28:41.319 --> 00:28:44.522
individuals. That won't come in

00:28:44.589 --> 00:28:48.593
no matter how urgent it is no

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:49.227
matter how many people down the

00:28:49.294 --> 00:28:49.794
street no matter how much we

00:28:49.861 --> 00:28:50.328
can prove that it is not

00:28:50.395 --> 00:28:52.831
beneficial for them to be on

00:28:52.897 --> 00:28:53.431
the street. De resistant to

00:28:53.498 --> 00:28:56.768
that I was glad to see that

00:28:56.835 --> 00:28:57.368
we're talking about actually

00:28:57.435 --> 00:29:01.005
talking to homeless people and

00:29:01.072 --> 00:29:01.639
asking them what will bring the

00:29:01.706 --> 00:29:02.240
men because I feel sometimes

00:29:02.307 --> 00:29:05.076
that's a little missing. In

00:29:05.143 --> 00:29:09.247
this equation. And I want to. I

00:29:09.314 --> 00:29:09.914
know Mr Murray isn't back there

00:29:09.981 --> 00:29:10.515
and I don't want to. Take a

00:29:10.582 --> 00:29:13.551
bottle of time but if you want

00:29:13.618 --> 00:29:14.185
to comment- where Mr Murray's

00:29:14.252 --> 00:29:17.856
house I don't know if we he

00:29:17.922 --> 00:29:21.793
gets. Personal privilege to. I

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:25.897
think my- my personal choice.

00:29:25.964 --> 00:29:26.531
Personal belief on that. Is I

00:29:26.598 --> 00:29:30.401
noticed said. Within the last

00:29:30.468 --> 00:29:31.002
couple years there's been more

00:29:31.069 --> 00:29:34.639
people. Join outreach programs

00:29:34.706 --> 00:29:35.273
people such as myself going out

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.610
and talking to people. You know

00:29:38.676 --> 00:29:39.210
because- the people that go

00:29:39.277 --> 00:29:43.014
out. I mean I'm able to sit on

00:29:43.081 --> 00:29:47.118
the curb. And talk to someone

00:29:47.185 --> 00:29:51.322
who's- suffered or separate and

00:29:51.389 --> 00:29:51.990

00:29:59.764 --> 00:30:03.701
you just have to you know and

00:30:03.768 --> 00:30:04.302

00:30:24.722 --> 00:30:28.560
of people find a lot of chance

00:30:28.626 --> 00:30:29.160

00:30:33.031 --> 00:30:33.531

00:31:18.509 --> 00:31:18.977
You know when I go into a

00:31:19.043 --> 00:31:22.947

00:31:31.322 --> 00:31:31.889
blessed with those vouchers but

00:31:31.956 --> 00:31:35.360
I didn't need them. And I tried

00:31:35.426 --> 00:31:35.994
to bless other people with them

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:36.561

00:32:33.818 --> 00:32:37.855
solution. You know and you

00:32:37.922 --> 00:32:38.456

experience. That you can share

00:33:45.623 --> 00:33:46.190
with people and hope for those

00:33:46.257 --> 00:33:49.160
people become hold as a result

00:33:49.227 --> 00:33:52.864
of that- one of things I. Want

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:53.464
to make mention of and also-

00:33:53.531 --> 00:33:57.101
will you talked about it. The

00:33:57.168 --> 00:33:57.735
number of individuals that die

00:33:57.802 --> 00:34:01.439
on our streets- and I happen to

00:34:01.506 --> 00:34:05.376
know. Personally and intimately

00:34:05.443 --> 00:34:05.910
that a number of homeless

00:34:05.977 --> 00:34:09.514
individuals. Are targeted- to

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:10.047
be robbed and also to be

00:34:10.114 --> 00:34:10.648
murdered. As it because they

00:34:10.715 --> 00:34:14.185
are homeless and I had a bill

00:34:14.252 --> 00:34:14.786
we work on that deal to bring

00:34:14.852 --> 00:34:18.189
it back to the legislature

00:34:18.256 --> 00:34:18.723
make. Hate crimes against

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:19.290
homeless individuals I hate

00:34:19.357 --> 00:34:22.326
crimes- and that's important

00:34:22.393 --> 00:34:26.164
because of my experience

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.731
sleeping on the streets and

00:34:26.798 --> 00:34:30.601
homes and vigils. Where someone

00:34:30.668 --> 00:34:31.235
was tend to run about. One to

00:34:31.302 --> 00:34:34.572
thirty in the morning- I was

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:35.173
sleep but my team was up and-

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:38.776
he came branch a gun on two

00:34:38.843 --> 00:34:39.410
occasions- and so we know what

00:34:39.477 --> 00:34:43.314
happens on the street. But what

00:34:43.381 --> 00:34:47.318
can you tell us. About the New

00:34:47.385 --> 00:34:47.919
York bottle. One in terms of

00:34:47.985 --> 00:34:48.553
best practices. And any of the

00:34:48.619 --> 00:34:51.556
best practices are actually

00:34:51.622 --> 00:34:52.190
being implemented here. And in

00:34:52.256 --> 00:34:52.690
the second piece to the

00:34:52.757 --> 00:34:55.560
question as well because we are

00:34:55.626 --> 00:34:56.093
now entering into a cold.

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:59.630
Winter the coal mines what are

00:34:59.697 --> 00:35:00.264
we doing to get individuals off

00:35:00.331 --> 00:35:03.901
the streets into. Shelters so

00:35:03.968 --> 00:35:04.469
they will have to experience

00:35:04.535 --> 00:35:08.139
the coldness. At present the

00:35:08.206 --> 00:35:12.443
question- because of the yeah

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:13.044
we did find that homicide was

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:13.678
to have doubled in the past six

00:35:13.744 --> 00:35:16.280
years among this population-

00:35:16.347 --> 00:35:16.914
the- we are. Actually have a

00:35:16.981 --> 00:35:20.618
scheduled- call meeting with

00:35:20.685 --> 00:35:21.185
the New York folks who do

00:35:21.252 --> 00:35:24.722
their- their mortality review-

00:35:24.789 --> 00:35:25.356
next week and so a lot of the

00:35:25.423 --> 00:35:25.923
lesson learning is going to.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:29.260
Come over the next couple of

00:35:29.327 --> 00:35:29.927
weeks so I don't have a trellis

00:35:29.994 --> 00:35:33.397
managed to share yet about what

00:35:33.464 --> 00:35:34.031
we what we're learning from New

00:35:34.098 --> 00:35:37.134
York but I but I would. You

00:35:37.201 --> 00:35:37.768
know double the opportunity to

00:35:37.835 --> 00:35:38.369
sort of come back the ones

00:35:38.436 --> 00:35:41.372
we've had those as I have those

00:35:41.439 --> 00:35:41.973
conversations causes all very

00:35:42.039 --> 00:35:42.507
fresh- the other questions

00:35:42.573 --> 00:35:45.943
about whether in about- about

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:49.780
season out yet we. We did we

00:35:49.847 --> 00:35:50.448
get I'm speaking from the data.

00:35:50.515 --> 00:35:54.185
Side of things we did look at

00:35:54.252 --> 00:35:54.852
the deaths by season to see if

00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:57.989
there's any seasonality that

00:35:58.055 --> 00:35:58.589
was something that that that

00:35:58.656 --> 00:35:59.257
was brought up only percent of

00:35:59.323 --> 00:35:59.824
this are there more deaths

00:35:59.891 --> 00:36:02.093
happening in the winter verses

00:36:02.159 --> 00:36:02.693
this summer- and- we- didn't.

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:06.664
Find any. Anything jumping out

00:36:06.731 --> 00:36:07.265
it does it doesn't mean that

00:36:07.331 --> 00:36:10.768
there aren't any weather

00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:11.435
related deaths it's just that-

00:36:11.502 --> 00:36:12.103
we need to look deeper into the

00:36:12.169 --> 00:36:15.039
causes of death- but that's

00:36:15.106 --> 00:36:15.673
come up several times and it's

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:19.010
something that we have. That we

00:36:19.076 --> 00:36:19.644
now know is important to follow

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:23.047
up on in terms of causes of

00:36:23.114 --> 00:36:23.648
death- the- folks up in the-

00:36:23.714 --> 00:36:24.181
elevator were particularly

00:36:24.248 --> 00:36:27.552
concerned gets gets really cold

00:36:27.618 --> 00:36:28.185
up there- but also gets really

00:36:28.252 --> 00:36:31.389
hot. There so that's also heat

00:36:31.455 --> 00:36:31.956
related deaths because of

00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:35.593
global warming so it's- it's

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:36.227
kind of a- double. Double edged

00:36:36.294 --> 00:36:39.897
sword. But I'm sorry five my

00:36:39.964 --> 00:36:48.005
follow up. Okay. I'll talk shop

00:36:48.072 --> 00:36:48.606
by we running behind schedule

00:36:48.673 --> 00:36:52.143
and the card is to us share.

00:36:52.209 --> 00:36:52.710
Okay is Mitchell sorry about

00:36:52.777 --> 00:36:53.244
that it's one make sure on

00:36:53.311 --> 00:36:56.547
respect for the rest of speaker

00:36:56.614 --> 00:36:57.114
so don't leave us. Thank you

00:36:57.181 --> 00:36:57.748
Mister chairman I appreciated-

00:36:57.815 --> 00:36:58.349
thank you to reset for always

00:36:58.416 --> 00:37:00.818
being willing to. Bring your

00:37:00.885 --> 00:37:04.956
truth to bear- you spend a lot

00:37:05.022 --> 00:37:05.590
of time in Sacramento testified

00:37:05.656 --> 00:37:06.223
on bills was good to see it on

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:09.126
I appreciate you. Continuing to

00:37:09.193 --> 00:37:13.197
hold us accountable. Dr Nicolas

00:37:13.264 --> 00:37:13.764
I'm curious about the slide

00:37:13.831 --> 00:37:17.702
here- because it's clear that

00:37:17.768 --> 00:37:18.302
there are hot spots indicated

00:37:18.369 --> 00:37:18.903
by the red and the yellow. And

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:21.606
I'm curious if you think- it

00:37:21.672 --> 00:37:22.239
makes sense because as we know

00:37:22.306 --> 00:37:25.576
all resources are limited. That

00:37:25.643 --> 00:37:26.243
there should be targeted if you

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:26.877
will for lack of a better term

00:37:26.944 --> 00:37:29.847
resources and focus on the

00:37:29.914 --> 00:37:30.514
areas that your data shells are

00:37:30.581 --> 00:37:31.148
the areas that are in the hot

00:37:31.215 --> 00:37:34.318
spots where deaths occur at a

00:37:34.385 --> 00:37:34.952
higher rate than other areas of

00:37:35.019 --> 00:37:35.553
the county is that. The county

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:42.259
strategy. Yes that's that's one

00:37:42.326 --> 00:37:42.893
of them- and it is yet striking

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.330
because it's yeah there's a

00:37:46.397 --> 00:37:46.897
concentration in the core

00:37:46.964 --> 00:37:47.498
downtown but you've got Long

00:37:47.565 --> 00:37:50.901
Beach Pomona. Venice Lancaster

00:37:50.968 --> 00:37:51.535
I mean it's all the corners of

00:37:51.602 --> 00:37:55.106
the county- and so. Yeah our

00:37:55.172 --> 00:37:55.740
next step after this is we're

00:37:55.806 --> 00:37:59.343
gonna this actually it's hard

00:37:59.410 --> 00:37:59.977
to see this red and orange the

00:38:00.044 --> 00:38:00.578
sort of the red ones of the-

00:38:00.645 --> 00:38:03.381
with the most. Deaths happen

00:38:03.447 --> 00:38:04.015
we're gonna go deeper and see

00:38:04.081 --> 00:38:04.448
if we can find the

00:38:04.515 --> 00:38:05.016
intersections where they're

00:38:05.082 --> 00:38:07.551
happening there state on that

00:38:07.618 --> 00:38:08.152
as well- yeah anything we can

00:38:08.219 --> 00:38:11.889
do to. Turn that our goal is to

00:38:11.956 --> 00:38:12.523
bring the number of homeless

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:13.190
debts down you know what at the

00:38:13.257 --> 00:38:15.793
same time the warehousing

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:16.360
people we want to make sure

00:38:16.427 --> 00:38:16.961
that there's fewer deaths on

00:38:17.028 --> 00:38:19.964
the street. And again I'm

00:38:20.031 --> 00:38:24.368
assuming. Estrategias to a yeah

00:38:24.435 --> 00:38:28.205
dig deeper and focus on. The

00:38:28.272 --> 00:38:28.773
higher rate absolutely yeah

00:38:28.839 --> 00:38:36.447
thank you. Rivas

00:38:40.685 --> 00:38:40.918
. Thank you to

00:38:40.985 --> 00:38:41.519
reset for being here and for

00:38:41.585 --> 00:38:42.119
sharing your story- you know

00:38:42.186 --> 00:38:44.855
the we always remember stories

00:38:44.922 --> 00:38:45.389
and it really helps- as a

00:38:45.456 --> 00:38:46.023
legislator I'm to hear directly

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:49.293
from someone on that has this

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:49.894
experience- I have a question

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:53.330
for Dr Nicholas on- the traffic

00:38:53.397 --> 00:38:53.864
the transportation related

00:38:53.931 --> 00:38:54.398
deaths you know I've been

00:38:54.465 --> 00:38:57.468
thinking about this lately

00:38:57.535 --> 00:38:58.069
because- there was just a van

00:38:58.135 --> 00:39:01.605
accident in that killed a

00:39:01.672 --> 00:39:02.206
homeless woman in Pacoima in

00:39:02.273 --> 00:39:05.776
the San Fernando Valley which

00:39:05.843 --> 00:39:06.377
is my district. Are we having

00:39:06.444 --> 00:39:09.714
can't meant on freeways I think

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:10.314
it's dangerous and- you dole

00:39:10.381 --> 00:39:13.918
and I'm working with Caltrans

00:39:13.984 --> 00:39:14.518
you know on the solution and

00:39:14.585 --> 00:39:18.222
they do have a process- but I

00:39:18.289 --> 00:39:18.823
was curious in terms of the

00:39:18.889 --> 00:39:19.323
this increased like you

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:22.493
mentioned that they've doubled-

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.160
is it both streets and highways

00:39:23.227 --> 00:39:26.931
or you know what can we do in

00:39:26.997 --> 00:39:27.565
terms at least their highways

00:39:27.631 --> 00:39:30.868
at the state level you know

00:39:30.935 --> 00:39:31.435
that's Caltrans I'm curious

00:39:31.502 --> 00:39:35.206
what we can do. To prevent

00:39:35.272 --> 00:39:39.210
those deaths. Yeah will our

00:39:39.276 --> 00:39:39.710
strategy there is we're

00:39:39.777 --> 00:39:40.311
fortunate here in LA- that we

00:39:40.377 --> 00:39:43.147
have a vision zero coalition

00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:43.714
that's initiative that the

00:39:43.781 --> 00:39:44.281
city's taken up to reduce-

00:39:44.348 --> 00:39:44.915
traffic fatalities vertically

00:39:44.982 --> 00:39:47.585
among pedestrians and cyclists

00:39:47.651 --> 00:39:51.589
which is over 80% of these.

00:39:51.655 --> 00:39:52.156
Traffic deaths among looks

00:39:52.223 --> 00:39:52.757
raising homelessness are among

00:39:52.823 --> 00:39:55.693
cyclists and pedestrians-

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:56.327
they're spread out there's not

00:39:56.393 --> 00:39:59.897
we didn't find a lot of

00:39:59.964 --> 00:40:00.498
concentrations of ended they

00:40:00.564 --> 00:40:01.098
they're probably a line with

00:40:01.165 --> 00:40:04.168
where the hot spots are that.

00:40:04.235 --> 00:40:04.769
That they've analyze for part

00:40:04.835 --> 00:40:05.402
as part of his and zero- we've

00:40:05.469 --> 00:40:08.439
been asking homeless folks-

00:40:08.506 --> 00:40:09.039
through our survey effort to

00:40:09.106 --> 00:40:12.476
get their feedback on whether

00:40:12.543 --> 00:40:13.077
they think there's- you know.

00:40:13.144 --> 00:40:16.547
Whether they think that. In a

00:40:16.614 --> 00:40:17.148
safe zone should be created

00:40:17.214 --> 00:40:20.818
for. Encampments or- you know

00:40:20.885 --> 00:40:21.418
more emergency call boxes on

00:40:21.485 --> 00:40:24.855
streets we sort of throwing out

00:40:24.922 --> 00:40:25.523
ideas and also asking them for

00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:26.056
what they they would think

00:40:26.123 --> 00:40:29.059
would be important for helping

00:40:29.126 --> 00:40:29.693
to. Helping to reduce these but

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:33.430
it's yeah it's striking- again

00:40:33.497 --> 00:40:37.368
yeah so it's really mostly

00:40:37.434 --> 00:40:37.968
through this vision zero at

00:40:38.035 --> 00:40:41.539
adding up up a focus on people

00:40:41.605 --> 00:40:42.139
experiencing homelessness in

00:40:42.206 --> 00:40:42.773
the in the vision zero plan is.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:49.847
What we're doing. Remember

00:40:49.914 --> 00:40:50.414

lose speakers- but I don't want

00:40:55.519 --> 00:40:55.986
to shy away from the needs

00:40:56.053 --> 00:40:58.489
questions we can always refer

00:40:58.556 --> 00:40:59.089

the show almost as- a few weeks

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:09.960
ago- right before the rain

00:42:10.027 --> 00:42:10.594
started aye aye. Most people

00:42:10.661 --> 00:42:13.731

to get a better understanding

00:42:18.202 --> 00:42:18.736
and- ends up that. I finally

00:42:18.802 --> 00:42:21.739

long it takes to get to that

00:42:26.844 --> 00:42:30.414
point. Here's what happened we

00:42:30.481 --> 00:42:34.318

better sense of urgency than

00:42:51.969 --> 00:42:52.536

pertaining to. Homelessness say.

00:44:10.214 --> 00:44:10.547
It's the locus of

00:44:10.614 --> 00:44:14.284
intersectional work for us but

00:44:14.351 --> 00:44:14.885
the bill is the of principle

00:44:14.952 --> 00:44:18.555
person who is all about

00:44:18.622 --> 00:44:19.089
homelessness mess it would

00:44:19.156 --> 00:44:22.726
about the public sentiment was

00:44:22.793 --> 00:44:26.864
in November just a few days ago

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:27.464
that the Los Angeles business

00:44:27.531 --> 00:44:31.001
council released a poll that

00:44:31.068 --> 00:44:31.635
showed that 95% Of Los Angeles

00:44:31.702 --> 00:44:35.305
county residents pointed to

00:44:35.372 --> 00:44:35.906
homelessness is the number one

00:44:35.973 --> 00:44:39.676
concern. We thought it was

00:44:39.743 --> 00:44:47.885
intense. All right. On the said

00:44:47.951 --> 00:44:48.352
lane and I took it too

00:44:48.419 --> 00:44:52.022
seriously I guess. We thought

00:44:52.089 --> 00:44:56.160
there was intensity in our

00:44:56.226 --> 00:45:00.230
polling twenty seventeen- but I

00:45:00.297 --> 00:45:00.798
just have to say it's more.

00:45:00.864 --> 00:45:04.668
Intense now. A recent poll by

00:45:04.735 --> 00:45:12.643
the counties association of.

00:45:12.709 --> 00:45:13.277
Governments that is sees that

00:45:13.343 --> 00:45:17.181
how poll and the children 90%

00:45:17.247 --> 00:45:21.251
of Californians are concerned

00:45:21.318 --> 00:45:25.155
about homelessness. PP I see.

00:45:25.222 --> 00:45:25.656
One out of every four

00:45:25.722 --> 00:45:29.493
Californians believe housing

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:30.127
and homelessness was the most

00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:33.530
important issue facing

00:45:33.597 --> 00:45:34.064
California today and that

00:45:34.131 --> 00:45:37.768
number was more sharply

00:45:37.835 --> 00:45:42.106
appointed to. In Los Angeles

00:45:42.172 --> 00:45:46.176
county. And in August- I did

00:45:46.243 --> 00:45:46.777
some focus group works a would

00:45:46.844 --> 00:45:50.280
six focus so- components. On

00:45:50.347 --> 00:45:54.651
the county of Los Angeles and

00:45:54.718 --> 00:45:55.285
they said it was just simply

00:45:55.352 --> 00:45:55.886
urgent and wanted to see bold

00:45:55.953 --> 00:46:02.826
action. Brought the work. Of

00:46:02.893 --> 00:46:06.830
that poll- that focus who

00:46:06.897 --> 00:46:07.364
worked for the committee's

00:46:07.431 --> 00:46:11.368
consideration. You heard from

00:46:11.435 --> 00:46:12.035
public health one of the things

00:46:12.102 --> 00:46:15.439
that is dramatizing the urgency

00:46:15.506 --> 00:46:16.039
of the moment Mister chairman

00:46:16.106 --> 00:46:19.443
and colleagues is this. One

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:23.881
every single day in the county

00:46:23.947 --> 00:46:27.851
of Los Angeles as many as three

00:46:27.918 --> 00:46:28.385
people die on our streets

00:46:28.452 --> 00:46:31.989
directly attributable to

00:46:32.055 --> 00:46:36.260
homelessness twice the homicide

00:46:36.326 --> 00:46:40.397
rate in this county. Now that

00:46:40.464 --> 00:46:40.998
doesn't get your attention I

00:46:41.064 --> 00:46:44.601
don't know what will. It is

00:46:44.668 --> 00:46:45.269
startling dated it is a triple

00:46:45.335 --> 00:46:48.639
double to the research done by

00:46:48.705 --> 00:46:49.206
none other than the county

00:46:49.273 --> 00:46:52.843
corner chief medical examiner.

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:57.314
Of the issues guns water

00:46:57.381 --> 00:46:57.948
control in this up taking until

00:46:58.015 --> 00:47:01.351
corner has gotten in. Trying to

00:47:01.418 --> 00:47:05.322
articulate methodologies as

00:47:05.389 --> 00:47:05.956
speak to prevention. Bob pulls

00:47:06.023 --> 00:47:09.626
the question to you one is a

00:47:09.693 --> 00:47:13.697
corner. Do prevention work. It

00:47:13.764 --> 00:47:14.164
speaks to the epidemic

00:47:14.231 --> 00:47:14.665
implications that we are

00:47:14.731 --> 00:47:17.935
confronted with them. Of the

00:47:18.001 --> 00:47:18.535
public health ways and says

00:47:18.602 --> 00:47:21.939
that they have a bigger

00:47:22.005 --> 00:47:22.573
database and sold these numbers

00:47:22.639 --> 00:47:23.006
are in that get this

00:47:23.073 --> 00:47:26.410
understated. So they went

00:47:26.476 --> 00:47:30.280
deeper and some of that you.

00:47:30.347 --> 00:47:34.551
Hearing now the average age.

00:47:34.618 --> 00:47:35.152
Death is you know was- fifty

00:47:35.219 --> 00:47:35.752
one years among the homeless

00:47:35.819 --> 00:47:38.922
population against seventy

00:47:38.989 --> 00:47:39.556
three of the general population

00:47:39.623 --> 00:47:40.157
you died twenty years early if

00:47:40.224 --> 00:47:46.997
you homeless. Over an hour.

00:47:47.064 --> 00:47:47.531
Just a few weeks ago at an

00:47:47.598 --> 00:47:48.131
entity called care harbored

00:47:48.198 --> 00:47:51.602
this was- we call this make a

00:47:51.668 --> 00:47:52.269
free clinic that used to be at

00:47:52.336 --> 00:47:55.706
the form and then it came to

00:47:55.772 --> 00:47:56.306
the sports arena knowledge at

00:47:56.373 --> 00:48:03.981
the reform. We decided that we

00:48:04.047 --> 00:48:04.615
would dedicate one of the three

00:48:04.681 --> 00:48:05.082
days. To the homeless

00:48:05.148 --> 00:48:12.055
population. And so eight

00:48:12.122 --> 00:48:12.623
hundred homeless individuals

00:48:12.689 --> 00:48:16.460
were provided direct medical

00:48:16.526 --> 00:48:17.060
care everything from dental

00:48:17.127 --> 00:48:20.831
visual mammograms name what the

00:48:20.897 --> 00:48:24.735
issue might be they got it and

00:48:24.801 --> 00:48:25.369
they will hold up out through a

00:48:25.435 --> 00:48:25.902
follow on service with a

00:48:25.969 --> 00:48:28.905
medical home. The providers

00:48:28.972 --> 00:48:33.043
participated in this to help

00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:33.677
them get there and so- this is

00:48:33.744 --> 00:48:37.314
yet again another way of

00:48:37.381 --> 00:48:37.981
dramatizing that people to the

00:48:38.048 --> 00:48:41.151
point of service resistance-

00:48:41.218 --> 00:48:45.589
it's a missed place debate that

00:48:45.656 --> 00:48:46.223
we just cut into that. Thirty

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:49.526
thousand people today are

00:48:49.593 --> 00:48:49.993
waiting shelter homes

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:53.997
opportunities and so it is not

00:48:54.064 --> 00:48:54.631
my view that we need to focus

00:48:54.698 --> 00:48:58.268
on those who may not want to

00:48:58.335 --> 00:48:58.869
come and just focus on those

00:48:58.935 --> 00:49:02.172
who want to come in and raise

00:49:02.239 --> 00:49:02.806
their hands and then we will do

00:49:02.873 --> 00:49:06.243
our job and do it well- the

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:06.810
county is funding intensive

00:49:06.877 --> 00:49:10.647
case management services for.

00:49:10.714 --> 00:49:14.685
Formerly homeless tenants. And

00:49:14.751 --> 00:49:15.185
all of news. From the

00:49:15.252 --> 00:49:18.989
supportive housing including

00:49:19.056 --> 00:49:19.623
triple H. funded projects self

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:20.157
bill we'll talk more about

00:49:20.223 --> 00:49:23.293
that- we are engaged in. A

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:27.130
range of- efforts as many of

00:49:27.197 --> 00:49:27.764
you know a hundred and twenty

00:49:27.831 --> 00:49:28.365
five million operate in drum

00:49:28.432 --> 00:49:31.501
housing and shelter sites. We

00:49:31.568 --> 00:49:32.135
do that in the unincorporated

00:49:32.202 --> 00:49:35.839
areas. And just from January of

00:49:35.906 --> 00:49:40.043
the twenty eighteen to now.

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:40.644
Almost three thousand new and

00:49:40.711 --> 00:49:43.780
from housing bids and

00:49:43.847 --> 00:49:44.414
individuals plus four hundred

00:49:44.481 --> 00:49:47.884
and drum housing units just in

00:49:47.951 --> 00:49:48.452
the largely unincorporated

00:49:48.518 --> 00:49:52.456
areas of Los Angeles county

00:49:52.522 --> 00:49:56.360
seventeen to shelters. On the

00:49:56.426 --> 00:49:56.860
way- that means another

00:49:56.927 --> 00:49:57.527
thirteen hundred people and yet.

00:49:57.594 --> 00:49:58.095
I would just scratching the

00:49:58.161 --> 00:50:04.601
surface. This isn't cutting it.

00:50:04.668 --> 00:50:08.805
Much much more has to be done.

00:50:08.872 --> 00:50:09.439
Couple weeks we'll do something

00:50:09.506 --> 00:50:13.043
called safe landing- but I

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:13.677
didn't of fifteenth in Normandy

00:50:13.744 --> 00:50:17.514
and twenty four seven access-

00:50:17.581 --> 00:50:18.081
to outreach teams to bring

00:50:18.148 --> 00:50:21.718
single individuals inside and

00:50:21.785 --> 00:50:22.252
receive clinically and had

00:50:22.319 --> 00:50:25.756
services this is going to be

00:50:25.822 --> 00:50:29.693
bridge housing on steroids. And

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:33.997
we need to do more than on the

00:50:34.064 --> 00:50:34.598
ground breaking will happen.

00:50:34.664 --> 00:50:35.232
But low buildings these are the

00:50:35.298 --> 00:50:38.101
innovations we have to do to

00:50:38.168 --> 00:50:42.205
get these buildings up more

00:50:42.272 --> 00:50:42.806
quickly can happen in four to

00:50:42.873 --> 00:50:46.543
five months. On at significant

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:47.144
cost savings. And so I just

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:50.680
want to say that. Urgency is

00:50:50.747 --> 00:50:51.348
the order of the day I've said

00:50:51.415 --> 00:50:52.015
that we need nothing short. Of

00:50:52.082 --> 00:50:54.918
a state of emergency some

00:50:54.985 --> 00:50:55.552
reacted to that and said well.

00:50:55.619 --> 00:50:58.789
We don't know if we do that

00:50:58.855 --> 00:50:59.322
that sounds like an open

00:50:59.389 --> 00:50:59.890
checkbook to me well if you

00:50:59.956 --> 00:51:00.524
don't want a state of emergency

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:03.293
then develop a comprehensive

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:03.894
crisis response strategy. Get

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:11.301
busy. That's what we have to do

00:51:11.368 --> 00:51:11.902
that the executive branch the

00:51:11.968 --> 00:51:15.605
legislative branch nothing else

00:51:15.672 --> 00:51:16.239
will satisfy this issue in the

00:51:16.306 --> 00:51:20.043
county of Los Angeles the

00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:20.644
epicenter of homelessness in

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:24.214
the state we because of measure

00:51:24.281 --> 00:51:28.084
H. but able to take as many as

00:51:28.151 --> 00:51:28.685
one hundred and thirty people

00:51:28.752 --> 00:51:29.286
off the streets out of almost

00:51:29.352 --> 00:51:32.389
every single day. Only to be

00:51:32.456 --> 00:51:36.626
met with a hundred and fifty.

00:51:36.693 --> 00:51:37.294
That fall into homelessness we

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:40.530
are losing ground as we speak.

00:51:40.597 --> 00:51:44.968
And that's after we put in an

00:51:45.035 --> 00:51:45.569
additional three hundred fifty

00:51:45.635 --> 00:51:46.169
five million every year that's

00:51:46.236 --> 00:51:46.703
on couple we were already

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:53.009
investing. And so it is in part

00:51:53.076 --> 00:51:53.643
a question of resources but is

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:54.277
not exclusively a question of

00:51:54.344 --> 00:51:57.481
resources I believe where

00:51:57.547 --> 00:51:58.081
there's a will there's a way

00:51:58.148 --> 00:51:58.682
where this money going to come

00:51:58.748 --> 00:52:01.485
from Ridley Thomas well I

00:52:01.551 --> 00:52:02.085
think. There are several ideas

00:52:02.152 --> 00:52:02.619
and play currently Mister

00:52:02.686 --> 00:52:05.922
chairman and colleagues of the

00:52:05.989 --> 00:52:10.026
issue is simply this. Of the

00:52:10.093 --> 00:52:10.627
prop sixty three resources. An

00:52:10.694 --> 00:52:14.364
SSH a we need to re think the

00:52:14.431 --> 00:52:18.034
deployment of those resources.

00:52:18.101 --> 00:52:18.702
And any county in the state of

00:52:18.768 --> 00:52:22.539
California who stopped falling

00:52:22.606 --> 00:52:23.106
resources today ought to be

00:52:23.173 --> 00:52:26.676
called for. And have to deal

00:52:26.743 --> 00:52:27.244
with it accordingly I start

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:30.647
with the county of Los Angeles.

00:52:30.714 --> 00:52:31.314
There is no reason for us to do

00:52:31.381 --> 00:52:35.051
anything other than to eat that

00:52:35.118 --> 00:52:35.652
doubly prudently strategically

00:52:35.719 --> 00:52:39.055
deploy these resources so that

00:52:39.122 --> 00:52:43.360
we can deal with. Lightly by

00:52:43.426 --> 00:52:44.027
the people who are yet homeless

00:52:44.094 --> 00:52:44.594
now not everyone agrees with

00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:47.597
that. But that's okay I'm

00:52:47.664 --> 00:52:51.535
prepared to repeated. The

00:52:51.601 --> 00:52:52.202
governor's desk three things of

00:52:52.269 --> 00:52:55.906
this task force and that is to

00:52:55.972 --> 00:52:56.540
N. street homelessness one and

00:52:56.606 --> 00:53:00.010
to break down the barriers to

00:53:00.076 --> 00:53:00.577
build more housing is the

00:53:00.644 --> 00:53:04.114
second point. And to get more

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:04.714
people into treatment is the

00:53:04.781 --> 00:53:05.348
third point the street that's

00:53:05.415 --> 00:53:08.385
three simple things that we can

00:53:08.451 --> 00:53:08.985
get to those things we will

00:53:09.052 --> 00:53:12.355
have earned our titles as being.

00:53:12.422 --> 00:53:16.793
Honorable I'll conclude with

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:17.427
the examples that I think can

00:53:17.494 --> 00:53:20.897
be made the real one would

00:53:20.964 --> 00:53:21.464
think about a comprehensive

00:53:21.531 --> 00:53:25.068
crisis response. Versus to

00:53:25.135 --> 00:53:29.139
extend statewide and broaden

00:53:29.205 --> 00:53:33.343
the authority of A. B. eleven

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:33.910
ninety seven shot up to the

00:53:33.977 --> 00:53:34.511
chair will that work. Shuttle

00:53:34.578 --> 00:53:37.414
to the city of Los Angeles for

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:38.048
collaborating with the chair in

00:53:38.114 --> 00:53:38.682
that pursuit to needy statewide

00:53:38.748 --> 00:53:41.484
Siegel relief is important.

00:53:41.551 --> 00:53:42.085
Then think we need to continue

00:53:42.152 --> 00:53:45.889
to examine a refined- the

00:53:45.956 --> 00:53:46.389
interpretation of grade

00:53:46.456 --> 00:53:54.097
disability press on to- LPS. It

00:53:54.164 --> 00:53:54.731
seems to me that to construct

00:53:54.798 --> 00:53:58.234
elaborate arguments that

00:53:58.301 --> 00:53:58.835
justified people literally-

00:53:58.902 --> 00:54:02.672
expiring on our streets and

00:54:02.739 --> 00:54:03.340
their own feces and Bob this is

00:54:03.406 --> 00:54:06.743
hugely problematic. We can do

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:07.344
better than that and we ought

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:15.018
to many new that LPS was over

00:54:15.085 --> 00:54:15.619
extended. At least forty years

00:54:15.685 --> 00:54:19.556
ago one of its own authors said

00:54:19.623 --> 00:54:23.493
ten years and we perhaps went

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:24.060
too far far we need to dial

00:54:24.127 --> 00:54:24.694
this back it is critical that

00:54:24.761 --> 00:54:27.664
we look at that seriously. I

00:54:27.731 --> 00:54:28.365
want to suggest that we need to

00:54:28.431 --> 00:54:31.968
capitalize on existing public

00:54:32.035 --> 00:54:32.502
policy of publicly owned

00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:35.839
properties and assets- right

00:54:35.905 --> 00:54:36.406
here on Skid Row state owns

00:54:36.473 --> 00:54:40.210
property of the city owns

00:54:40.276 --> 00:54:44.047
property county owns property

00:54:44.114 --> 00:54:44.714
us get role is indefensible in

00:54:44.781 --> 00:54:48.351
the day of the week and we are

00:54:48.418 --> 00:54:52.422
not accept these conditions but

00:54:52.489 --> 00:54:52.989
I refuse to believe that we

00:54:53.056 --> 00:54:56.926
have to. I just refuse to

00:54:56.993 --> 00:54:57.494
believe that I think changes

00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:00.897
can be brought to bear Mister

00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:01.498
chairman and I know that you

00:55:01.564 --> 00:55:02.132
and your colleagues share that.

00:55:02.198 --> 00:55:05.068
Point of view. Our we are

00:55:05.135 --> 00:55:05.602
released my phone at this

00:55:05.669 --> 00:55:09.472
point. I do want to punctuate

00:55:09.539 --> 00:55:10.040
the point that urgency is of

00:55:10.106 --> 00:55:10.640
critical nature I did want to

00:55:10.707 --> 00:55:13.677
show to the findings of the

00:55:13.743 --> 00:55:21.651
focus group work that- were

00:55:21.718 --> 00:55:25.955
done. Are just a. Few weeks

00:55:26.022 --> 00:55:30.193
ago- creating safe leaving

00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:30.760
sites another shelter type

00:55:30.827 --> 00:55:34.064
facility was number one. For

00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:38.334
those who were in these groups.

00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:38.968
Freezing rent levels statewide

00:55:39.035 --> 00:55:42.672
was another point. Providing

00:55:42.739 --> 00:55:43.306
incentives to landlords to rent

00:55:43.373 --> 00:55:46.576
to those experiencing

00:55:46.643 --> 00:55:47.110
homelessness and reducing

00:55:47.177 --> 00:55:50.814
discrimination against low

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:51.347
income renters was a third

00:55:51.414 --> 00:55:51.915
point. Museum publicly and

00:55:51.981 --> 00:55:52.449
privately owned lands and

00:55:52.515 --> 00:55:55.351
buildings. Became important for

00:55:55.418 --> 00:55:59.355
these groups on the use of

00:55:59.422 --> 00:55:59.989
groups that were interesting in

00:56:00.056 --> 00:56:03.526
terms of- Latinos- and someone

00:56:03.593 --> 00:56:04.094
monolingual Latinos others

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:07.497
African Americans- angles.

00:56:07.564 --> 00:56:12.001
Disciplines from multi ethnic

00:56:12.068 --> 00:56:12.502
groups so there was six

00:56:12.569 --> 00:56:16.072
different focus groups and

00:56:16.139 --> 00:56:16.706
finally- A. B. group- and so we

00:56:16.773 --> 00:56:17.240
looked at this because he

00:56:17.307 --> 00:56:20.276
wanted to be in for. And our

00:56:20.343 --> 00:56:24.547
advocacy. And I take away from

00:56:24.614 --> 00:56:25.148
this and all the other polling

00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:28.451
and focus group work. To

00:56:28.518 --> 00:56:32.489
underscore the issue of urgency.

00:56:32.555 --> 00:56:33.123
A comprehensive crisis response

00:56:33.189 --> 00:56:33.757
strategy doesn't that mean that

00:56:33.823 --> 00:56:37.026
we have to have a right to

00:56:37.093 --> 00:56:41.164
housing- right to write to the

00:56:41.231 --> 00:56:41.798
war right to shelter and when

00:56:41.865 --> 00:56:44.968
we began this where we thought

00:56:45.034 --> 00:56:45.568
affordable housing which is an

00:56:45.635 --> 00:56:46.236
aspirational objectives that we

00:56:46.302 --> 00:56:49.372
still maintain was what we

00:56:49.439 --> 00:56:50.006
should focus on now we have to

00:56:50.073 --> 00:56:53.777
deal with short term solutions.

00:56:53.843 --> 00:56:54.410
We cannot allow people to stay

00:56:54.477 --> 00:56:57.847
on the streets if it takes

00:56:57.914 --> 00:56:58.448
three to four years to build

00:56:58.515 --> 00:57:01.718
affordable housing that's wait

00:57:01.785 --> 00:57:02.385
too long to tolerate we need to

00:57:02.452 --> 00:57:06.189
deal with the immediacy of the

00:57:06.256 --> 00:57:10.326
moment I thank you Mister

00:57:10.393 --> 00:57:10.827
chair. And colleagues.

00:57:10.894 --> 00:57:18.501
Supervisor chancellor. Good

00:57:18.568 --> 00:57:19.102
morning the honorable members

00:57:19.169 --> 00:57:22.639
I'm finance on the director Los

00:57:22.705 --> 00:57:23.139
Angeles county homeless

00:57:23.206 --> 00:57:26.810
initiative and I appreciate the

00:57:26.876 --> 00:57:27.410
opportunity. To speak with you

00:57:27.477 --> 00:57:28.011
today. Through their carried

00:57:28.077 --> 00:57:31.147
through their board of

00:57:31.214 --> 00:57:31.714
supervisors leadership in

00:57:31.781 --> 00:57:34.984
launching the homeless

00:57:35.051 --> 00:57:35.552
initiative in August of two

00:57:35.618 --> 00:57:36.152
thousand fifteen. And accept

00:57:36.219 --> 00:57:39.355
the responsibility that is

00:57:39.422 --> 00:57:39.923
fragmented among government

00:57:39.989 --> 00:57:43.593
entities stepping up and saying

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:44.194
that the county would assume

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:44.694
that role of county wide

00:57:44.761 --> 00:57:47.931
leadership. We've been able to

00:57:47.997 --> 00:57:51.768
make meaningful progress. As a

00:57:51.835 --> 00:57:52.435
coordinated county wide system

00:57:52.502 --> 00:57:55.972
we're doing more today than

00:57:56.039 --> 00:57:56.472
ever before in helping

00:57:56.539 --> 00:58:00.310
thousands as- homeless families

00:58:00.376 --> 00:58:00.944
youth and individuals move into

00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:04.414
permanent housing. In calendar

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:08.751
year two thousand eighteen

00:58:08.818 --> 00:58:09.319
alone the homeless service

00:58:09.385 --> 00:58:09.986
delivery system directly helped

00:58:10.053 --> 00:58:13.056
over twenty one thousand family

00:58:13.122 --> 00:58:13.690
members individuals move from

00:58:13.756 --> 00:58:17.060
homelessness into permanent

00:58:17.126 --> 00:58:17.660
housing which is double the

00:58:17.727 --> 00:58:21.231
number who are helping to

00:58:21.297 --> 00:58:21.831
permanent housing before the

00:58:21.898 --> 00:58:22.332
homeless initiative was

00:58:22.398 --> 00:58:25.468
launched. And we provide aid

00:58:25.535 --> 00:58:29.372
I'm outreach services and

00:58:29.439 --> 00:58:30.006
prevention to triple the number

00:58:30.073 --> 00:58:33.676
of people who were Sir before

00:58:33.743 --> 00:58:34.244
the homeless initiative and

00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:37.714
measure H. measure age was

00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:38.348
approved by Los Angeles county

00:58:38.414 --> 00:58:42.051
voters in March of two thousand

00:58:42.118 --> 00:58:42.585
seventeen take effect in

00:58:42.652 --> 00:58:43.219
October twenty seventeen. With

00:58:43.286 --> 00:58:46.055
the board's concurrence we

00:58:46.122 --> 00:58:46.589
began providing expanded

00:58:46.656 --> 00:58:50.093
services supported by measure

00:58:50.159 --> 00:58:50.660
H. three months before the

00:58:50.727 --> 00:58:54.297
tactic of fact precisely

00:58:54.364 --> 00:58:54.898
because of the urgency of this

00:58:54.964 --> 00:58:55.498
crisis. And in the twenty one

00:58:55.565 --> 00:58:58.968
minds from July two thousand

00:58:59.035 --> 00:58:59.602
seventeen. Through September of

00:58:59.669 --> 00:59:02.772
two thousand nineteen. Measure

00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:07.176
H. enabled seventeen thousand

00:59:07.243 --> 00:59:07.810
eight hundred and five homeless

00:59:07.877 --> 00:59:11.014
family members and individuals

00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:11.648
to move into permanent housing

00:59:11.714 --> 00:59:15.285
and an additional thirty five

00:59:15.351 --> 00:59:15.785
thousand family members

00:59:15.852 --> 00:59:19.422
individuals moved into an arm

00:59:19.489 --> 00:59:19.989
has seen during that same

00:59:20.056 --> 00:59:23.526
period of time in arm housing

00:59:23.593 --> 00:59:24.160
founded in whole. Or in part by

00:59:24.227 --> 00:59:27.764
measure H. so these are

00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:28.398
extraordinary numbers of people

00:59:28.464 --> 00:59:32.068
moving. Office aids in tener

00:59:32.135 --> 00:59:32.635
housing and into permanent

00:59:32.702 --> 00:59:36.339
housing and yet at the same

00:59:36.406 --> 00:59:36.973
time the crisis is worse. As we

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:40.643
all know from January two

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:44.314
thousand eighteen to January

00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:44.881
two thousand nineteen. The

00:59:44.948 --> 00:59:45.515
increase in Los Angeles county

00:59:45.581 --> 00:59:48.551
homeless population was 12%

00:59:48.618 --> 00:59:52.689
That was less than any other

00:59:52.755 --> 00:59:53.356
urban area in California by a

00:59:53.423 --> 00:59:56.993
lot and still completely

00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:57.593
unacceptable absent measure H.

00:59:57.660 --> 01:00:01.264
it would have been that much

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:01.898
worse. A supervisor Lee Thomas

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:05.668
noted in each on the average

01:00:05.735 --> 01:00:09.772
day of two thousand eighteen

01:00:09.839 --> 01:00:10.373
one hundred and thirty three

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:10.873
people every day exited

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:13.776
homelessness in Los Angeles

01:00:13.843 --> 01:00:14.410
county through a combination of

01:00:14.477 --> 01:00:15.011
the work at home the service

01:00:15.078 --> 01:00:17.981
delivery system. And the

01:00:18.047 --> 01:00:18.548
resilience and resources of

01:00:18.614 --> 01:00:21.918
people experiencing

01:00:21.985 --> 01:00:22.552
homelessness who got back into

01:00:22.618 --> 01:00:26.189
permanent housing on their own

01:00:26.255 --> 01:00:26.823
but on that same average day a

01:00:26.889 --> 01:00:30.393
hundred and fifty people became

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:31.027
homeless in Los Angeles county

01:00:31.094 --> 01:00:34.530
primarily because of the

01:00:34.597 --> 01:00:35.131
combination. Of skyrocketing

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:39.002
rents I'm jazzed evictions and

01:00:39.068 --> 01:00:39.569
a severe lack. Of affordable

01:00:39.635 --> 01:00:43.039
housing. We are working to

01:00:43.106 --> 01:00:46.943
gather in an extraordinary

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:47.477
movement that is brought

01:00:47.543 --> 01:00:47.944
together hundreds of

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:51.247
organizations and literally

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:51.848
tens of thousands of people's

01:00:51.914 --> 01:00:55.585
across government. Community

01:00:55.651 --> 01:00:59.589
providers business and faith

01:00:59.655 --> 01:01:00.189
organizations. In a scale that

01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:03.693
we have never seen before. To

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.227
help people move out of

01:01:04.293 --> 01:01:07.997
homelessness we are bailing

01:01:08.064 --> 01:01:11.968
water out of this boat faster

01:01:12.035 --> 01:01:12.602
than ever before but the hole

01:01:12.668 --> 01:01:13.269
in the bottom of the boat is so

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:16.572
large that we are at risk of

01:01:16.639 --> 01:01:20.710
this boat sinking and the total

01:01:20.777 --> 01:01:21.344
number of our neighbors who are

01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:24.680
homeless on the streets.

01:01:24.747 --> 01:01:28.785
Continues to grow. So we have

01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:29.352
double down continuing to

01:01:29.419 --> 01:01:32.822
execute these comprehensive

01:01:32.889 --> 01:01:33.423
strategies which are having a

01:01:33.489 --> 01:01:37.060
historic level of success in

01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:37.727
moving people from homelessness

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:38.327
into permanent housing and at

01:01:38.394 --> 01:01:41.531
the same time we continue to

01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:45.401
implement. Innovative new

01:01:45.468 --> 01:01:46.035
solutions I want to underscore

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:49.705
that there are thirty thousand

01:01:49.772 --> 01:01:50.373
people that are homeless in Los

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:53.676
Angeles county. They have been

01:01:53.743 --> 01:01:54.310
a stashed and you want to move

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:54.944
into permanent housing. And the

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:58.247
most immediate bear your turn

01:01:58.314 --> 01:01:58.848
their ability to do that is

01:01:58.915 --> 01:02:02.285
funding for rental subsidies.

01:02:02.351 --> 01:02:06.255
It's much faster. J. provide

01:02:06.322 --> 01:02:06.856
funding for rental subsidies

01:02:06.923 --> 01:02:10.359
then it is to build a new inner

01:02:10.426 --> 01:02:10.927
housing facility and it's

01:02:10.993 --> 01:02:14.831
cheaper to we can provide

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:15.465
permanent housing not build it.

01:02:15.531 --> 01:02:18.801
By provide rental subsidies

01:02:18.868 --> 01:02:22.872
India current rental housing.

01:02:22.939 --> 01:02:23.473
More quickly and more cheaply

01:02:23.539 --> 01:02:27.443
that is the fastest solution to

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:27.977
this crisis. Some of the

01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:31.481
specific actions innovative

01:02:31.547 --> 01:02:35.384
actions that are under way

01:02:35.451 --> 01:02:36.052
include reducing the number of

01:02:36.119 --> 01:02:39.722
call county clients who become

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:40.256
homeless by leveraging our

01:02:40.323 --> 01:02:43.893
mainstream systems social

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:44.360
services child welfare

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:48.030
probation health and mental

01:02:48.097 --> 01:02:48.498
health. The board of

01:02:48.564 --> 01:02:49.065
supervisors has adopted the

01:02:49.132 --> 01:02:52.535
first permanent rent stabilized

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:53.035
ation ordinance in the

01:02:53.102 --> 01:02:56.372
unincorporated areas if any

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:56.973
county in the country and in

01:02:57.039 --> 01:03:00.409
California and are incorporated

01:03:00.476 --> 01:03:01.043
areas if they were city would

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:04.614
be the second largest city in

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:05.181
Los Angeles county with over

01:03:05.248 --> 01:03:08.951
million residents. The words

01:03:09.018 --> 01:03:09.452
approved fining for new

01:03:09.519 --> 01:03:10.019
eviction defense program for

01:03:10.086 --> 01:03:13.189
low income tenants in certain

01:03:13.256 --> 01:03:13.789
targeted zip codes I'm working

01:03:13.856 --> 01:03:17.293
and we are working

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:17.927
collaboratively with the city

01:03:17.994 --> 01:03:18.528
of Los Angeles it is funny is

01:03:18.594 --> 01:03:21.497
similar program to implement a

01:03:21.564 --> 01:03:22.064
seamless program. In those

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:25.601
targeted zip codes we're

01:03:25.668 --> 01:03:26.169
expanding the use of shared

01:03:26.235 --> 01:03:29.972
housing. Both as a response to

01:03:30.039 --> 01:03:30.573
the cost of housing and the

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:34.043
lack of supply to enable more

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:34.477
people to move from

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:35.044
homelessness into permanent

01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:38.347
housing. We're expanding safe

01:03:38.414 --> 01:03:42.451
parking and mobile showers and

01:03:42.518 --> 01:03:43.085
exploring the establishment of

01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:46.622
safe sleep sites to respond to

01:03:46.689 --> 01:03:50.459
the immediate needs of people

01:03:50.526 --> 01:03:51.060
were sleeping in encampments.

01:03:51.127 --> 01:03:54.564
And on our streets. We're

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:55.097
building more interim and

01:03:55.164 --> 01:03:55.698
permanent supportive housing

01:03:55.765 --> 01:03:59.268
and we have more in terms has

01:03:59.335 --> 01:04:02.939
seen and permits supportive

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:03.606
housing in the pipeline in Los

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:07.043
Angeles county than ever before

01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:07.610
over six thousand units of

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:08.211
permanent supportive housing

01:04:08.277 --> 01:04:11.547
are scheduled to come on line

01:04:11.614 --> 01:04:12.148
in Los Angeles county. In the

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:12.648
next three years as the

01:04:12.715 --> 01:04:15.818
supervisor mentioned we will

01:04:15.885 --> 01:04:19.555
use measure H. to find

01:04:19.622 --> 01:04:20.089
intensive case management

01:04:20.156 --> 01:04:20.723
services in all of those units

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:24.026
and in those next three years

01:04:24.093 --> 01:04:24.660
those will largely be units in

01:04:24.727 --> 01:04:25.194
the city of Los Angeles.

01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:28.297
Constructed through proposition

01:04:28.364 --> 01:04:32.401
triple H. we're taking

01:04:32.468 --> 01:04:33.035
advantage Mister chairman and

01:04:33.102 --> 01:04:36.372
AB two ten legislation which

01:04:36.439 --> 01:04:36.973
you carried in two thousand

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:37.506
seventeen sponsored by the

01:04:37.573 --> 01:04:40.710
county of Los Angeles. Where we

01:04:40.776 --> 01:04:44.647
are Gen we are now implementing

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:45.081
a new cutting edge

01:04:45.147 --> 01:04:48.851
technological solution which

01:04:48.918 --> 01:04:49.518
will enable outreach workers in

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:50.152
case managers relying on that

01:04:50.219 --> 01:04:53.222
authority granted by the

01:04:53.289 --> 01:04:57.193
legislature and the governor.

01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:57.727
To look at a person and

01:04:57.793 --> 01:04:58.327
determine wider their current

01:04:58.394 --> 01:05:01.731
services and what have there

01:05:01.797 --> 01:05:02.398
been there passed services from

01:05:02.465 --> 01:05:05.468
the homeless services status

01:05:05.534 --> 01:05:06.002
system and for mainstream

01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:06.569
county departments these are

01:05:06.636 --> 01:05:09.939
outreach workers on the

01:05:10.006 --> 01:05:10.473
sidewalk talking to people

01:05:10.539 --> 01:05:13.976
experiencing homelessness. And

01:05:14.043 --> 01:05:14.543
finally in terms of these

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:15.144
innovative actions I want to

01:05:15.211 --> 01:05:18.381
note that we're working very

01:05:18.447 --> 01:05:19.048
closely with the cities across

01:05:19.115 --> 01:05:22.451
Los Angeles county not only Los

01:05:22.518 --> 01:05:23.052
Angeles city but the eighty

01:05:23.119 --> 01:05:26.522
seven smaller cities as well.

01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:27.189
Forty cities in the county that

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:30.826
are home 295% of the county

01:05:30.893 --> 01:05:31.360
homeless population that

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:34.764
resides in cities. Have

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:35.197
developed their own

01:05:35.264 --> 01:05:38.968
homelessness plans find it by

01:05:39.035 --> 01:05:39.468
the county and we're now

01:05:39.535 --> 01:05:40.102
finding those cities and their

01:05:40.169 --> 01:05:43.406
councils of governments to

01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:44.073
support implementation of those

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:47.476
homelessness plans cities in

01:05:47.543 --> 01:05:48.044
the county have moved from

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:51.681
saying it's not our problem. To

01:05:51.747 --> 01:05:52.248
saying how can we help. And

01:05:52.315 --> 01:05:56.018
with all yet with all of this

01:05:56.085 --> 01:05:56.585
work we cannot do this by

01:05:56.652 --> 01:05:59.889
ourselves with all the

01:05:59.955 --> 01:06:00.389
resources I'm press and

01:06:00.456 --> 01:06:04.060
resources provided by measure

01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:04.560
H. we cannot as local

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:08.364
government. Solve this crisis

01:06:08.431 --> 01:06:12.234
ourselves any in particular we

01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:12.868
need your continued help from

01:06:12.935 --> 01:06:16.372
the state. How from the state

01:06:16.439 --> 01:06:16.972
to protect tenants from being

01:06:17.039 --> 01:06:17.506
displaced. To increase the

01:06:17.573 --> 01:06:20.876
supply of housing and to

01:06:20.943 --> 01:06:21.444
provide additional funding.

01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:25.214
Fining particularly for rental

01:06:25.281 --> 01:06:28.884
subsidies as I mentioned. And

01:06:28.951 --> 01:06:29.418
to keep assisted living

01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:33.289
facilities open. We greatly

01:06:33.356 --> 01:06:33.856
appreciate the work of the

01:06:33.923 --> 01:06:37.293
legislature and the governor

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:37.893
last year in particular the

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:38.561
enactment of AB fourteen eighty

01:06:38.627 --> 01:06:41.764
to. Enactment of SB three

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:45.634
twenty nine authored by senator

01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:46.235
Mitchell and sponsored by the

01:06:46.302 --> 01:06:49.772
county and funding for the

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:50.406
homeless housing assistance and

01:06:50.473 --> 01:06:51.040
prevention program. But as we

01:06:51.107 --> 01:06:54.110
move forward into twenty

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:54.744
twenty. We very much need your

01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:58.147
assistance and continuing to

01:06:58.214 --> 01:06:58.647
work together to secure

01:06:58.714 --> 01:06:59.215
additional state funding and

01:06:59.281 --> 01:07:02.651
policy changes which will

01:07:02.718 --> 01:07:03.252
enable us to both reduce the

01:07:03.319 --> 01:07:06.589
number of families and adults

01:07:06.655 --> 01:07:07.056
who are falling into

01:07:07.123 --> 01:07:10.593
homelessness. And to help

01:07:10.659 --> 01:07:11.127
families and adults were

01:07:11.193 --> 01:07:11.694
already homeless moving to

01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:14.997
permanent housing. One eight

01:07:15.064 --> 01:07:19.235
just reinforces supervisors

01:07:19.301 --> 01:07:19.869
comment about urgency and about

01:07:19.935 --> 01:07:23.439
our commitment there were many

01:07:23.506 --> 01:07:27.343
of that as- I'm in this system

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:27.910
including myself who spent

01:07:27.977 --> 01:07:31.480
thanksgiving weekend ensuring

01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:32.081
that we would have emergency

01:07:32.148 --> 01:07:35.684
shelters open. Ahead of

01:07:35.751 --> 01:07:36.352
schedule. For people who are on

01:07:36.419 --> 01:07:39.922
the streets during last week's

01:07:39.989 --> 01:07:40.523
storms. That exemplifies our

01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:44.260
commitment to responding

01:07:44.326 --> 01:07:48.197
urgently to bring our homeless

01:07:48.264 --> 01:07:48.798
neighbor's home I did reduce

01:07:48.864 --> 01:07:49.432
the flow of people and almost

01:07:49.498 --> 01:07:52.668

questions as you all might have

I'm gonna give you a little bit

01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:31.140
of a progress report on the

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:34.310
production of HHH. Under the

01:08:34.376 --> 01:08:38.481
backdrop of. The fact that the

01:08:38.547 --> 01:08:39.081
state of California has one

01:08:39.148 --> 01:08:39.682
third of the U. S. homeless

01:08:39.748 --> 01:08:42.651
population. The state of

01:08:42.718 --> 01:08:43.285
California has one third of the

01:08:43.352 --> 01:08:46.555
U. S. homeless population. The

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:47.156
county of Los Angeles has one

01:08:47.223 --> 01:08:51.126
half of the state's homeless

01:08:51.193 --> 01:08:51.760
population just to give you. A

01:08:51.827 --> 01:08:55.231
sense of the gravity of and

01:08:55.297 --> 01:08:55.865
magnitude of this crises. Up

01:08:55.931 --> 01:08:59.568
under that backdrop- in twenty

01:08:59.635 --> 01:09:00.169
sixteen just three years ago.

01:09:00.236 --> 01:09:03.672
Of voters in the city of Los

01:09:03.739 --> 01:09:07.443
Angeles approved measure HHH in

01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:08.043
an overwhelming. Majority of

01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:08.611
the vote. And out of whole

01:09:08.677 --> 01:09:12.081
cloth three years later we have

01:09:12.147 --> 01:09:15.718
the ten thousand units. Are in

01:09:15.784 --> 01:09:16.285
the pipeline- funded under

01:09:16.352 --> 01:09:20.089
construction- with about two

01:09:20.155 --> 01:09:20.723
thousand of those units set to

01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:24.460
open within twelve months one

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:25.094
calendar year. Do following on

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:28.631
the heels of HHH in November of

01:09:28.697 --> 01:09:29.198
twenty sixteen. Measure H.

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:32.601
passes you know in in the

01:09:32.668 --> 01:09:33.135
spring. Of providing the

01:09:33.202 --> 01:09:36.872
services- the wraparound

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:37.473
services that are needed- at

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:38.073
all of these permits for of

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:41.210
housing sites temporary bridge

01:09:41.277 --> 01:09:41.844
shelter whatever it may be. A

01:09:41.911 --> 01:09:45.381
funded by the county and it was

01:09:45.447 --> 01:09:46.015
Los Angeles city voters that

01:09:46.081 --> 01:09:49.318
put H. over the top to make

01:09:49.385 --> 01:09:49.785
sure that it would be

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:50.286
successful and pass. Los

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:53.689
Angeles voters a Los Angeles

01:09:53.756 --> 01:09:54.356
residents have known for a long

01:09:54.423 --> 01:09:57.793
time. That it'll have to be all

01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:58.460
hands on deck to really make a

01:09:58.527 --> 01:10:01.931
dent in this homelessness

01:10:01.997 --> 01:10:02.531
crises that we find ourselves

01:10:02.598 --> 01:10:06.001
in- that it was built up over a

01:10:06.068 --> 01:10:06.635
number of decades and not years

01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:10.072
or months- but none the less

01:10:10.139 --> 01:10:10.739
here's what we have- I think as

01:10:10.806 --> 01:10:11.373
Mr and Salas just mention. We

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:14.343
have an unprecedented level of

01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:14.944
collaboration and cooperation

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:18.781
Anna in addressing this crises

01:10:18.847 --> 01:10:22.718
between of various government

01:10:22.785 --> 01:10:23.319
agencies county and city. Of

01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:26.822
Los Angeles was the very first

01:10:26.889 --> 01:10:27.289
city in the state of

01:10:27.356 --> 01:10:30.893
California. To create a funds

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:31.493
to address homelessness I and

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:32.127
so I'm very proud of that fact

01:10:32.194 --> 01:10:35.364
and then. Some other cities

01:10:35.431 --> 01:10:35.965
have followed since that time

01:10:36.031 --> 01:10:39.234
we know that Sacramento- has-

01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:43.339
taken action as has San

01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:43.939
Francisco and on the ballot

01:10:44.006 --> 01:10:44.540
coming up- initiatives in in

01:10:44.607 --> 01:10:47.876
the spring or San Jose and

01:10:47.943 --> 01:10:48.477
Oakland. So cities across the

01:10:48.544 --> 01:10:51.947
state large cities are starting

01:10:52.014 --> 01:10:52.581
to recognize that. In order to

01:10:52.648 --> 01:10:56.018
get control of this double

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:56.652
digit increase in homelessness

01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:57.286
your- after year. They're also

01:10:57.353 --> 01:11:00.155
gonna have to have skin in the

01:11:00.222 --> 01:11:04.193
game at the local level. I

01:11:04.259 --> 01:11:04.860
think that it's very very clear

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:08.397
with what we're up against we

01:11:08.464 --> 01:11:09.064
know that ten thousand units in

01:11:09.131 --> 01:11:09.698
the city of Los Angeles or not

01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:12.868
going to house the thirty six

01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:13.502
thousand. I individuals who are

01:11:13.569 --> 01:11:17.106
on sheltered and on housing- in

01:11:17.172 --> 01:11:17.740
the city of Los Angeles we want

01:11:17.806 --> 01:11:20.843
to keep this production going

01:11:20.909 --> 01:11:21.377
somehow some way. Now I

01:11:21.443 --> 01:11:25.080
mentioned that we created this.

01:11:25.147 --> 01:11:25.714
Acesse out of whole cloth just

01:11:25.781 --> 01:11:29.351
three years later we have. Of

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:29.918
these- these facts to it too

01:11:29.985 --> 01:11:33.389
but I think- be very proud of-

01:11:33.455 --> 01:11:37.593
however we need much much more-

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:38.193
is so. I've gone to Sacramento

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:38.827
a couple of times will be there

01:11:38.894 --> 01:11:41.964
again next month working very

01:11:42.031 --> 01:11:42.531
closely with our mayor and

01:11:42.598 --> 01:11:46.168
you're about to hear from

01:11:46.235 --> 01:11:46.802
Cristina Miller it. On what we

01:11:46.869 --> 01:11:54.276
feel makes sense for a- a bill.

01:11:54.343 --> 01:11:54.877
Off from the state legislature

01:11:54.943 --> 01:11:55.511
and approved by the governor.

01:11:55.577 --> 01:11:58.781
Where in we can keep these

01:11:58.847 --> 01:12:02.751
resources going- so that we can

01:12:02.818 --> 01:12:03.352
keep the production going of

01:12:03.419 --> 01:12:06.755
services. Bridge home shelters

01:12:06.822 --> 01:12:07.289
and permanent supportive

01:12:07.356 --> 01:12:07.890
housing. The one thing that we

01:12:07.956 --> 01:12:11.360
always lack and I just heard

01:12:11.427 --> 01:12:11.894
mentioned. Thirty thousand

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:15.130
individuals are homeless right

01:12:15.197 --> 01:12:15.764
now have are willing to accept

01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:16.331
Abed but we do not have the

01:12:16.398 --> 01:12:19.668
inventory. As the chair of the

01:12:19.735 --> 01:12:23.639
homelessness and poverty

01:12:23.706 --> 01:12:24.239
committee on that lawcenter

01:12:24.306 --> 01:12:27.710
city council. My main goal is

01:12:27.776 --> 01:12:28.310
to produce inventory so we can

01:12:28.377 --> 01:12:31.880
get people under a roof without

01:12:31.947 --> 01:12:32.548
that we cannot affected fully.

01:12:32.614 --> 01:12:36.318
Even talk about ending

01:12:36.385 --> 01:12:36.919
homelessness we have to have

01:12:36.985 --> 01:12:40.155
the inventory to do that first

01:12:40.222 --> 01:12:40.789
we have a whole range of other

01:12:40.856 --> 01:12:44.359
issues to deal with we know

01:12:44.426 --> 01:12:44.993
that in in in closing we know

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:48.764
that. When the LA times and

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:52.668
other educational institutions

01:12:52.735 --> 01:12:53.302
did some deep digging into the

01:12:53.368 --> 01:12:53.936
Los account from earlier this

01:12:54.002 --> 01:12:57.272
year- it was discovered- there

01:12:57.339 --> 01:13:01.176
right in the numbers that the

01:13:01.243 --> 01:13:01.810
majority of folks affected by

01:13:01.877 --> 01:13:05.481
homelessness have mental health

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:06.014
issues or drug addiction

01:13:06.081 --> 01:13:09.451
issues. We have to address that

01:13:09.518 --> 01:13:10.018
at the local and state level

01:13:10.085 --> 01:13:13.522
along with the production of

01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:14.156
this inventory of beds that I'm

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:17.860
talking about I and- we look

01:13:17.926 --> 01:13:21.830
forward to working with all of

01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:22.464
use the state and the assembly

01:13:22.531 --> 01:13:23.098
on helping to craft a bill for

01:13:23.165 --> 01:13:26.435
the entire state- but let me

01:13:26.502 --> 01:13:30.239
just say one. Has a minor one

01:13:30.305 --> 01:13:30.839
more time the county of Los

01:13:30.906 --> 01:13:31.507
Angeles has half of the state's

01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:34.543
homeless population who wanna

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:35.144
make sure that the resources

01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:38.714
that we identify- did take into

01:13:38.781 --> 01:13:42.718
consideration. That fact and

01:13:42.785 --> 01:13:43.152
that the funding is

01:13:43.218 --> 01:13:43.786
commensurate with the need- and

01:13:43.852 --> 01:13:47.055
I think that our friends and

01:13:47.122 --> 01:13:47.656
allies up and down the state

01:13:47.723 --> 01:13:48.257
will understand that because

01:13:48.323 --> 01:13:51.293
homelessness is everywhere. In

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:51.860
the state of California as

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:55.430
never before again thank you

01:13:55.497 --> 01:13:56.031
for your time and I'm happy to

01:13:56.098 --> 01:14:03.605
answer questions. Amir deputy.

01:14:03.672 --> 01:14:04.206
And good morning has deemed

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:07.810
committee members my name is

01:14:07.876 --> 01:14:08.410
Christina Miller deputy mayor

01:14:08.477 --> 01:14:08.844
of city homelessness

01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:09.478
initiatives I thank you for the

01:14:09.545 --> 01:14:10.078
opportunity and privilege to

01:14:10.145 --> 01:14:12.014
testify at before you on the

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:12.581
city's current efforts under

01:14:12.648 --> 01:14:13.148
America studies leadership I

01:14:13.215 --> 01:14:13.715
also want to thank the state

01:14:13.782 --> 01:14:16.251
for the two rounds of the-

01:14:16.318 --> 01:14:16.852
state. Block grants heap at

01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:20.489
which is the grants at the city

01:14:20.556 --> 01:14:21.156
received in twenty eighteen. At

01:14:21.223 --> 01:14:24.359
the city has committed nearly

01:14:24.426 --> 01:14:24.993
1100% of those funds and that

01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:28.564
is far ahead of schedule at the

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:29.131
deadline to commit. 50% of

01:14:29.198 --> 01:14:32.868
those funds out was January is

01:14:32.935 --> 01:14:33.468
January twenty twenty so the

01:14:33.535 --> 01:14:36.872
city is- had a schedule and

01:14:36.939 --> 01:14:37.472
making sure that we get those

01:14:37.539 --> 01:14:41.243
funds out the door. And since

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:41.877
we are on Skid Row and now I've

01:14:41.944 --> 01:14:42.544
mention heat I do also want to

01:14:42.611 --> 01:14:45.647
posit- and lift up. The passage

01:14:45.714 --> 01:14:46.281
of a recent program that is he

01:14:46.348 --> 01:14:49.451
funded at that will target and

01:14:49.518 --> 01:14:50.085
black women who are vulnerable

01:14:50.152 --> 01:14:50.719
living on the streets of Skid

01:14:50.786 --> 01:14:53.856
Row. As a one point five

01:14:53.922 --> 01:14:54.523
million dollar program in which

01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:57.860
we will target outreach to

01:14:57.926 --> 01:14:58.493
vulnerable women who are living

01:14:58.560 --> 01:14:59.161
on the streets. And triage them

01:14:59.228 --> 01:15:01.930
to permit housing as quickly as

01:15:01.997 --> 01:15:02.497
we can another part of that

01:15:02.564 --> 01:15:06.134
program is to. Provide cultural

01:15:06.201 --> 01:15:06.768
competency training to service

01:15:06.835 --> 01:15:10.272
providers to make sure we can

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:10.906
at see what learning some of

01:15:10.973 --> 01:15:11.473
can be scaled I'm in this

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:14.509
program that want to look that

01:15:14.576 --> 01:15:15.077
up it seemed appropriate and

01:15:15.143 --> 01:15:15.644
give the location of this

01:15:15.711 --> 01:15:19.014
hearing. And again also I think

01:15:19.081 --> 01:15:19.648
the state for the hap grant and

01:15:19.715 --> 01:15:22.918
these grants are critical for

01:15:22.985 --> 01:15:23.518
expanding the impact of our

01:15:23.585 --> 01:15:24.186
local strategies we cannot do

01:15:24.253 --> 01:15:27.356
this work without you. And be

01:15:27.422 --> 01:15:27.990
very sure what the Ste the city

01:15:28.056 --> 01:15:31.193
strategies look like I do want

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:31.760
to underscore and the story

01:15:31.827 --> 01:15:35.697
that fill shared about what was

01:15:35.764 --> 01:15:36.331
what we are able to accomplish

01:15:36.398 --> 01:15:36.965
last week. He gave me a sense

01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:39.902
of hope I'm in the speed by

01:15:39.968 --> 01:15:40.569
which the city in the county of

01:15:40.636 --> 01:15:43.805
Lhasa were able to work

01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:44.406
together. And as many of us

01:15:44.473 --> 01:15:45.007
were you know settling in for

01:15:45.073 --> 01:15:48.343
the holiday to be inside in the

01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:48.844
warm and eva family and

01:15:48.911 --> 01:15:52.147
celebrate what we're grateful

01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:52.681
for. The reality was very

01:15:52.748 --> 01:15:53.348
different for people living on

01:15:53.415 --> 01:15:56.285
the streets of Los Angeles they

01:15:56.351 --> 01:15:56.885
were faced with a very cold

01:15:56.952 --> 01:16:00.289
winter storm. And with really

01:16:00.355 --> 01:16:00.923
few options in terms of where

01:16:00.989 --> 01:16:01.456
to go our winter shelter

01:16:01.523 --> 01:16:04.726
program does not begin until

01:16:04.793 --> 01:16:05.327
December first- and so it was

01:16:05.394 --> 01:16:08.764
with a nimble nest and

01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:09.398
flexibility that I don't think

01:16:09.464 --> 01:16:12.868
I've ever seen. The city in

01:16:12.935 --> 01:16:13.535
casting worked together to open

01:16:13.602 --> 01:16:14.102
up. Over eleven hundred need

01:16:14.169 --> 01:16:17.406
shelter. For bad. To make sure

01:16:17.472 --> 01:16:21.276
that we can provide options for

01:16:21.343 --> 01:16:21.877
people who were vulnerable and

01:16:21.944 --> 01:16:22.411
second who needed to come

01:16:22.477 --> 01:16:23.011
inside. With the bad weather

01:16:23.078 --> 01:16:23.545
coming. On this required.

01:16:23.612 --> 01:16:25.514
Activating reckon parks

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:26.048
facilities that were never

01:16:26.114 --> 01:16:26.682
meant to be winter shelters we

01:16:26.748 --> 01:16:29.484
had city staff on on call

01:16:29.551 --> 01:16:30.085
twenty four hours a day. The

01:16:30.152 --> 01:16:30.686
American red cross stepped up.

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:31.386
And loss that was that was that

01:16:31.453 --> 01:16:34.189
you know a major player their-

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:34.756
volunteers recall from the

01:16:34.823 --> 01:16:38.160
everyone in efforts okay. It

01:16:38.226 --> 01:16:38.760
really did kind of run you a

01:16:38.827 --> 01:16:39.361
sense of hope for me anyway

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:42.164
that and what we can achieve if

01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:42.764
we do all work together and

01:16:42.831 --> 01:16:43.332
look at. This as the crisis

01:16:43.398 --> 01:16:43.966
that is. I'm but in the limited

01:16:44.032 --> 01:16:46.735
time that I have- I would like

01:16:46.802 --> 01:16:47.336
to share some of the work the

01:16:47.402 --> 01:16:50.806
city's focused on. Our current

01:16:50.872 --> 01:16:51.440
home this budget is four eight

01:16:51.506 --> 01:16:52.074
six two million dollars. This

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:54.943
is twenty five times of the

01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:55.544
homelessness budget. Was just

01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:56.144
four years ago and two thirds

01:16:56.211 --> 01:16:59.181
of which- have been set aside

01:16:59.247 --> 01:16:59.781
for permanent housing with our

01:16:59.848 --> 01:17:03.218
triple H. program. And the mers

01:17:03.285 --> 01:17:03.785
primary areas of focus for

01:17:03.852 --> 01:17:06.989
street our streets strategies

01:17:07.055 --> 01:17:07.489
and tackling and shelter

01:17:07.556 --> 01:17:08.090
homelessness. Interim housing

01:17:08.156 --> 01:17:08.690
affordable housing development

01:17:08.757 --> 01:17:11.393
and preservation. At a place

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:12.060
bass strategy in Skid Row. For

01:17:12.127 --> 01:17:15.630
street strategies the mayor has

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:16.298
set up the unified homelessness

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:16.865
response center. This is the

01:17:16.932 --> 01:17:19.935
physical space the coal locate

01:17:20.002 --> 01:17:20.569
vital for the leadership. Is a

01:17:20.635 --> 01:17:21.103
Central Command post to

01:17:21.169 --> 01:17:24.039
coordinate the deployment of

01:17:24.106 --> 01:17:24.639
resources that interface of

01:17:24.706 --> 01:17:27.976
people living on sheltered.

01:17:28.043 --> 01:17:28.610
This sounds like something the

01:17:28.677 --> 01:17:29.177
city would have had before

01:17:29.244 --> 01:17:32.514
right but was just establish

01:17:32.581 --> 01:17:33.081
just last year. And we to

01:17:33.148 --> 01:17:36.518
playing early eighteen hundred

01:17:36.585 --> 01:17:37.052
operations per month that

01:17:37.119 --> 01:17:37.686
entail integration of. Services

01:17:37.753 --> 01:17:40.722
an outreach with sanitation

01:17:40.789 --> 01:17:41.223
resources to focus on

01:17:41.289 --> 01:17:44.626
delivering outreach services.

01:17:44.693 --> 01:17:45.260
But also to manage- cleanliness

01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:45.861
and public spaces. Be unified

01:17:45.927 --> 01:17:49.064
with this response center is

01:17:49.131 --> 01:17:49.531
the command post also

01:17:49.598 --> 01:17:50.165
coordinates operations during

01:17:50.232 --> 01:17:53.201
emergencies. AB most recently

01:17:53.268 --> 01:17:53.802
with the fires and again with

01:17:53.869 --> 01:17:57.239
that the heavy rains. And the

01:17:57.305 --> 01:17:57.873
next phase is to make vì you

01:17:57.939 --> 01:18:01.777
HRC a twenty four hour center.

01:18:01.843 --> 01:18:02.377
Our right now it has normal

01:18:02.444 --> 01:18:05.747
business hours but we know

01:18:05.814 --> 01:18:06.348
those are not the hours that

01:18:06.415 --> 01:18:07.015
homelessness keeps. They do not

01:18:07.082 --> 01:18:09.684
at people living on the streets

01:18:09.751 --> 01:18:10.285
do not keep bankers hours we

01:18:10.352 --> 01:18:10.886
need to have resources twenty

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:13.922
four hours a day. For

01:18:13.989 --> 01:18:18.026
intermountain the mers a bridge

01:18:18.093 --> 01:18:18.560
home program which was in.

01:18:18.627 --> 01:18:19.161
Eighteen months ago has five

01:18:19.227 --> 01:18:19.728
hundred nineteen new beds a

01:18:19.795 --> 01:18:22.130
bridge housing opens a date.

01:18:22.197 --> 01:18:22.697
And a total of twenty four

01:18:22.764 --> 01:18:23.331
hundred new shelter beds total

01:18:23.398 --> 01:18:26.501
in the pipeline that is thirty

01:18:26.568 --> 01:18:27.135
separate shelters that we are-

01:18:27.202 --> 01:18:30.405
hoping to have open by June.

01:18:30.472 --> 01:18:30.906
Twenty twenty- I'll just

01:18:30.972 --> 01:18:31.506
underscore this is the largest

01:18:31.573 --> 01:18:35.077
capital program shelter program

01:18:35.143 --> 01:18:35.744
that is as the launched in the

01:18:35.811 --> 01:18:39.181
country. There's no playbook

01:18:39.247 --> 01:18:39.781
with how you stand up thirty

01:18:39.848 --> 01:18:43.051
shelters- within the course of

01:18:43.118 --> 01:18:43.652
under two years. So we are we

01:18:43.718 --> 01:18:47.189
are blazing the trail here. Am

01:18:47.255 --> 01:18:47.856
I also invite everyone to visit

01:18:47.923 --> 01:18:48.490
the mers website at Ellie mayor

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:51.426
.org backslash homelessness if

01:18:51.493 --> 01:18:52.027
you want to track the progress

01:18:52.094 --> 01:18:52.627
of those different Bridgetown

01:18:52.694 --> 01:18:55.897
shelters. I'm also during his

01:18:55.964 --> 01:18:56.531
time in office the mayor's work

01:18:56.598 --> 01:18:57.032
diligently with counsel

01:18:57.099 --> 01:19:00.035
partners and others to pass.

01:19:00.102 --> 01:19:00.635
The affordable the affordable

01:19:00.702 --> 01:19:03.839
housing linkage be transit

01:19:03.905 --> 01:19:04.406
oriented community programs.

01:19:04.473 --> 01:19:05.073
Triple H. at triple H. housing

01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:08.410
challenge- which is on its way

01:19:08.477 --> 01:19:09.010
to produce over ten thousand

01:19:09.077 --> 01:19:12.581
units- of affordable housing of

01:19:12.647 --> 01:19:13.181
which eight hundred thousand

01:19:13.248 --> 01:19:16.451
will be supportive housing. We

01:19:16.518 --> 01:19:17.052
have our first opening at the

01:19:17.119 --> 01:19:17.619
end of this month. Fingers

01:19:17.686 --> 01:19:18.253
crossed god help us we want to

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.922
make sure we get that first

01:19:20.989 --> 01:19:21.523
project open in the calendar

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:24.759
year twenty nineteen- there's

01:19:24.826 --> 01:19:25.327
also strengthened the rent

01:19:25.393 --> 01:19:25.927
stabilization ordinance. Has

01:19:25.994 --> 01:19:29.097
reached a goal of permitting

01:19:29.164 --> 01:19:29.598
one thousand one hundred

01:19:29.664 --> 01:19:33.101
thousand units. Of a housing

01:19:33.168 --> 01:19:33.702
two years ahead of schedule.

01:19:33.768 --> 01:19:34.302
And in fact in July of this

01:19:34.369 --> 01:19:37.672
year LA city was responsible

01:19:37.739 --> 01:19:38.273
for permitting 25% of all the

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:41.710
housing units in the entire

01:19:41.776 --> 01:19:42.277
state. And we are 10% of the

01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:50.018
population. We are tremendous

01:19:50.085 --> 01:19:50.619
road ahead of us in tackling

01:19:50.685 --> 01:19:51.253
the homelessness crisis. There

01:19:51.319 --> 01:19:51.853
is no doubt AB the amount of

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:52.454
groundwork laid over the last

01:19:52.521 --> 01:19:53.922
three years has been

01:19:53.989 --> 01:19:54.556
astounding. And I say this as

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:55.190
someone who worked in the field

01:19:55.257 --> 01:19:58.226
for a dozen years first as a

01:19:58.293 --> 01:19:58.860
service provider. On the ground

01:19:58.927 --> 01:19:59.461
serving people who were and

01:19:59.528 --> 01:20:02.531
sheltered- and it is pretty

01:20:02.597 --> 01:20:03.165
tremendous what we've been able

01:20:03.231 --> 01:20:10.572
to at least the groundwork.

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:11.206
Growing an ongoing partnership

01:20:11.273 --> 01:20:15.043
with the state and identifying

01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.644
the much needed resources to

01:20:15.710 --> 01:20:16.278
truly move the needle and bring

01:20:16.344 --> 01:20:19.080
people indoors thank you. Thank

01:20:19.147 --> 01:20:23.418
you and then I wanna I know-

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:27.255
the supervisor I one last thing

01:20:27.322 --> 01:20:27.923
to say and I'm a handed over to

01:20:27.989 --> 01:20:28.557
questions Q. and I'm I'm gonna

01:20:28.623 --> 01:20:29.191
go over to miss Mitchell in and

01:20:29.257 --> 01:20:35.564
Mr Hertzberg. In Gipson.

01:20:35.630 --> 01:20:36.164
Supervisor of thank you very

01:20:36.231 --> 01:20:39.935
much was German just of a quick

01:20:40.001 --> 01:20:40.602
couple of remarks response your

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:44.172
opening comments about of the

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:48.410
issue of- blossom and it's. On

01:20:48.476 --> 01:20:56.551
responsiveness to your- request.

01:20:56.618 --> 01:20:57.185
Clearly homelessness is a heavy

01:20:57.252 --> 01:21:04.826
heavy lift. I want to say that

01:21:04.893 --> 01:21:05.427
it's the case that- loss of

01:21:05.493 --> 01:21:09.130
will be going through a

01:21:09.197 --> 01:21:13.201
transition and- presumed

01:21:13.268 --> 01:21:13.768
restructuring all this is a

01:21:13.835 --> 01:21:17.339
matter of public record- and I

01:21:17.405 --> 01:21:17.939
welcome it- a lot of work has

01:21:18.006 --> 01:21:21.977
been done over the past five

01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:25.714
years- but more work needs to

01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:26.314
be done- better work smarter

01:21:26.381 --> 01:21:30.151
work work defined by more

01:21:30.218 --> 01:21:34.089
activation and agility- I don't

01:21:34.155 --> 01:21:38.326
think so we were at a-

01:21:38.393 --> 01:21:38.960
adequately prepared for what we

01:21:39.027 --> 01:21:42.464
are contending with. And so the

01:21:42.530 --> 01:21:46.534
amount praise that we may elect

01:21:46.601 --> 01:21:47.168
to heap upon ourselves is not

01:21:47.235 --> 01:21:50.739
squaring with voters- the

01:21:50.805 --> 01:21:54.876
polling that we shared- in each

01:21:54.943 --> 01:21:55.410
instance right there is a

01:21:55.477 --> 01:21:55.977
pretty heavy dissatisfaction

01:21:56.044 --> 01:22:03.218
rate with what has been done-

01:22:03.285 --> 01:22:03.885
with- the city's measures some

01:22:03.952 --> 01:22:07.355
measure and with the counties

01:22:07.422 --> 01:22:07.956
much I think we need to speak

01:22:08.023 --> 01:22:11.559
candidly about this in such a

01:22:11.626 --> 01:22:12.193
way that we know we have to do

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:16.197
a lot. More a lot more. We need

01:22:16.264 --> 01:22:20.001
to assess and real time where

01:22:20.068 --> 01:22:24.039
we are chairman. And scale up

01:22:24.105 --> 01:22:24.606
our capacity aye innovations

01:22:24.673 --> 01:22:28.410
are. Flexibility we've got to

01:22:28.476 --> 01:22:32.580
do some things in a different

01:22:32.647 --> 01:22:33.214
way now the county has to take

01:22:33.281 --> 01:22:36.885
responsibility for its piece of

01:22:36.951 --> 01:22:37.419
that puzzle. One Lhasa was

01:22:37.485 --> 01:22:41.122
first started the county had to

01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:41.623
be brought screaming and

01:22:41.690 --> 01:22:45.293
kicking the table to address

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:45.894
homelessness forty years ago.

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:49.497
Is now the case of the county

01:22:49.564 --> 01:22:53.201
funds loss at 70% of its budget.

01:22:53.268 --> 01:22:57.372
70% of losses resources come

01:22:57.439 --> 01:22:57.872
through- measure age and

01:22:57.939 --> 01:22:58.306
additional related.

01:22:58.373 --> 01:23:01.910
Expenditures so accountability

01:23:01.976 --> 01:23:05.814
is the order of the day of the

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:06.448
state has made its way to Los

01:23:06.514 --> 01:23:09.951
Angeles and the significant

01:23:10.018 --> 01:23:14.255
manner. A hundred and eighteen

01:23:14.322 --> 01:23:14.756
thousand in terms of app

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:15.390
dollars projected. Of for this

01:23:15.457 --> 01:23:18.393
year sixty five million. For

01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:22.864
the county hundred and eighteen

01:23:22.931 --> 01:23:26.668
for the city sixty five for. De.

01:23:26.735 --> 01:23:31.206
County sixty seven for loss of

01:23:31.272 --> 01:23:31.740
there's a distribution of

01:23:31.806 --> 01:23:35.210
resources here the speak to

01:23:35.276 --> 01:23:39.080
accountability and so while we

01:23:39.147 --> 01:23:39.681
all want to say what we are

01:23:39.748 --> 01:23:43.485
doing I wish to say we have to

01:23:43.551 --> 01:23:44.119
do a lot more and the people of

01:23:44.185 --> 01:23:47.822
this region expect no less. We

01:23:47.889 --> 01:23:51.793
are obliged to. Thank you

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:52.360
Mister thank you with that-

01:23:52.427 --> 01:23:52.961
miss Mitchell Mister Hertzberg

01:23:53.027 --> 01:23:55.997
and Mister Gipson. Thank you

01:23:56.064 --> 01:23:56.598
very much chairman thank you

01:23:56.664 --> 01:24:04.172
all for coming today. And thank

01:24:04.239 --> 01:24:08.376
goodness for H. HHH and he- I

01:24:08.443 --> 01:24:09.010
tried that goes without saying.

01:24:09.077 --> 01:24:12.580
But you know well as I've been

01:24:12.647 --> 01:24:13.181
a lot of time thinking about

01:24:13.248 --> 01:24:13.782
this you know the reality is

01:24:13.848 --> 01:24:17.018
that what we are experiencing

01:24:17.085 --> 01:24:17.652
what the whole meal like times.

01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:21.122
Indicated is the result of what

01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:25.059
I would cut call a slow boil.

01:24:25.126 --> 01:24:25.693
We didn't give your overnight.

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:26.294
And I am reminded of my ten

01:24:26.361 --> 01:24:29.664
years in the legislature Mr and

01:24:29.731 --> 01:24:30.331
sale coming diligently the fact

01:24:30.398 --> 01:24:33.568
real every year. Bringing me a

01:24:33.635 --> 01:24:34.202
chart that I would hang on my

01:24:34.269 --> 01:24:37.739
front door. That show over time

01:24:37.806 --> 01:24:42.043
the state's- lack of investment

01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:42.644
in cal works the years that we

01:24:42.710 --> 01:24:45.914
cut the cal works grant. And a

01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:46.448
direct correlation to the

01:24:46.514 --> 01:24:47.015
number of cal works families

01:24:47.081 --> 01:24:50.018
that were in three homelessness.

01:24:50.084 --> 01:24:54.289
For ten years every year would

01:24:54.355 --> 01:24:54.889
see that chart out hang on the

01:24:54.956 --> 01:24:55.490
front door as a reminder. And

01:24:55.557 --> 01:24:58.560
so what I want to talk about or

01:24:58.626 --> 01:25:02.630
or or really polls is. Given

01:25:02.697 --> 01:25:03.264
our collective agreement on the

01:25:03.331 --> 01:25:06.868
sense of urgency today how are

01:25:06.935 --> 01:25:07.368
we going to sustain our

01:25:07.435 --> 01:25:11.072
investment over time. Because

01:25:11.139 --> 01:25:15.343
during tough economic times for

01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:15.877
government. Is when the

01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:19.547
citizenry in our residents need

01:25:19.614 --> 01:25:23.618
government the mouth. So during

01:25:23.685 --> 01:25:24.219
that ten year recession when

01:25:24.285 --> 01:25:24.786
the state couldn't pass a

01:25:24.853 --> 01:25:27.922
budget on time- because member

01:25:27.989 --> 01:25:31.759
folks are fighting for these

01:25:31.826 --> 01:25:32.360
services and they were forced

01:25:32.427 --> 01:25:32.994
with the two thirds requirement

01:25:33.061 --> 01:25:36.331
to cut investments that was the

01:25:36.397 --> 01:25:36.931
from the beginning of the flow

01:25:36.998 --> 01:25:40.535
of oil. That we're experiencing

01:25:40.602 --> 01:25:41.102
today. And so how do we all

01:25:41.169 --> 01:25:44.506
levels of government the

01:25:44.572 --> 01:25:45.106
collective commitment. Because

01:25:45.173 --> 01:25:48.543
while the LA L. has in the part

01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:49.210
of finance have stated that for

01:25:49.277 --> 01:25:49.844
this next year we look release

01:25:49.911 --> 01:25:53.047
pretty thought the general fund

01:25:53.114 --> 01:25:53.681
we all know the pendulum will

01:25:53.748 --> 01:25:57.051
swing. So how do we all hold

01:25:57.118 --> 01:26:00.889
hands. Calls our nose in job

01:26:00.955 --> 01:26:01.489
and make the promise that we

01:26:01.556 --> 01:26:02.123
won't do what. Government tends

01:26:02.190 --> 01:26:05.493
to do. Such a government

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:06.127
economic times we cut services

01:26:06.194 --> 01:26:09.564
people need the most when

01:26:09.631 --> 01:26:10.198
they're broke and government's

01:26:10.265 --> 01:26:13.735
broke too. This is a slow boil

01:26:13.801 --> 01:26:17.672
so how do we not. Continue to

01:26:17.739 --> 01:26:18.273
take full advantage of this

01:26:18.339 --> 01:26:18.907
moment in time investment by

01:26:18.973 --> 01:26:21.976
not making a commitment to

01:26:22.043 --> 01:26:26.114
sustain it over time. I'll just

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:26.714
quickly all say it's a matter

01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:30.385
of leadership. If we didn't

01:26:30.451 --> 01:26:31.019
have the governor we have now.

01:26:31.085 --> 01:26:34.589
In good times we wouldn't be

01:26:34.656 --> 01:26:35.189
making the decisions that we

01:26:35.256 --> 01:26:38.593
are making of the previous

01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:39.193
governor refused to recognize

01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:42.931
this crisis. And to the extent

01:26:42.997 --> 01:26:46.834
that that is the case exactly

01:26:46.901 --> 01:26:47.302
and his predecessors

01:26:47.368 --> 01:26:50.905
predecessor and so it has been-

01:26:50.972 --> 01:26:55.243
also a conspicuous absence. Of

01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:55.843
leadership and engagement on

01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:59.514
this crisis now this is not to

01:26:59.581 --> 01:27:00.181
say and a whole so matter they

01:27:00.248 --> 01:27:03.551
did nothing of value as a

01:27:03.618 --> 01:27:04.118
governor's of the state of

01:27:04.185 --> 01:27:04.619
California but on this

01:27:04.686 --> 01:27:07.622
question- they were.

01:27:07.689 --> 01:27:11.859
Significantly absent on from

01:27:11.926 --> 01:27:12.493
their post and it is compounded

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:16.230
the crisis in this state from

01:27:16.297 --> 01:27:16.764
that assertion I will not

01:27:16.831 --> 01:27:20.368
retreat. And nor would I stand

01:27:20.435 --> 01:27:21.002
up beside you I just think you

01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:24.505
know it's important for us to

01:27:24.572 --> 01:27:25.106
acknowledge that there were

01:27:25.173 --> 01:27:28.543
decisions made by elected

01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:29.143
bodies that we all currently

01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:32.614
serve on- that that that lit

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:33.247
the fire a slow boil the fact

01:27:33.314 --> 01:27:37.085
70% of section out section

01:27:37.151 --> 01:27:37.719
eight voucher holders couldn't

01:27:37.785 --> 01:27:38.353
find a place to you about your-

01:27:38.419 --> 01:27:41.222
is it. Is a crime the in the

01:27:41.289 --> 01:27:41.856
early two thousands we cut the

01:27:41.923 --> 01:27:45.426
cal works grant- to historic

01:27:45.493 --> 01:27:49.330
lows in my opinion is a crime

01:27:49.397 --> 01:27:49.897
and sold a my point is. You

01:27:49.964 --> 01:27:54.002
know. The buildings Aug grand

01:27:54.068 --> 01:27:54.569
opening sexy I get that and

01:27:54.636 --> 01:27:57.805
those are important to do but

01:27:57.872 --> 01:27:58.506
there's other work that we have

01:27:58.573 --> 01:27:59.173
to do to make sure that we are

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:02.076
making sure that the least

01:28:02.143 --> 01:28:02.610
among us continue to have

01:28:02.677 --> 01:28:03.244
resources to be able to afford

01:28:03.311 --> 01:28:03.811
the rent whatever the right

01:28:03.878 --> 01:28:06.280
level. Is that we are

01:28:06.347 --> 01:28:10.251
continuing to fully utilize

01:28:10.318 --> 01:28:10.885
it'll federal dollars the fact

01:28:10.952 --> 01:28:11.452
you know the section Davis

01:28:11.519 --> 01:28:14.455
friendly funded we have to make

01:28:14.522 --> 01:28:15.056
sure that people can use the

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:15.657
voucher particular here in LA

01:28:15.723 --> 01:28:18.760
county when you wait ten years

01:28:18.826 --> 01:28:19.360
to get it- and so I just want

01:28:19.427 --> 01:28:22.930
us to think. Broadly in

01:28:22.997 --> 01:28:23.498
creatively about how we are

01:28:23.564 --> 01:28:26.934
allies on this moment in time

01:28:27.001 --> 01:28:27.468
on the public's. Focus in

01:28:27.535 --> 01:28:31.139
interest and make sure that

01:28:31.205 --> 01:28:31.806
it's stained over time that we

01:28:31.873 --> 01:28:35.410
don't continue this Evan flow

01:28:35.476 --> 01:28:36.044
of investment divestment- that

01:28:36.110 --> 01:28:43.751
that compromises. Life liberty

01:28:43.818 --> 01:28:44.385
and the pursuit of happiness a

01:28:44.452 --> 01:28:47.822
really that I thank you. Eight

01:28:47.889 --> 01:28:48.456
dollars need to be revisited I

01:28:48.523 --> 01:28:49.023
think general at the state

01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:52.060
level. And at the county level

01:28:52.126 --> 01:28:52.694
I think G. R. dollars needs to

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:56.130
be revisited and re distributed

01:28:56.197 --> 01:28:56.798
you can start there but what we

01:28:56.864 --> 01:29:00.401
have. And if we could. Do what

01:29:00.468 --> 01:29:01.069
government does it do. Which is

01:29:01.135 --> 01:29:04.539
the to think creatively about

01:29:04.605 --> 01:29:05.173
our silo funding you know I'm

01:29:05.239 --> 01:29:05.807
hoping that the state is going

01:29:05.873 --> 01:29:08.810
to be successful in their

01:29:08.876 --> 01:29:09.243
eleven fifteen wager

01:29:09.310 --> 01:29:12.747
application. To look at the

01:29:12.814 --> 01:29:13.347
whole person. And to look at

01:29:13.414 --> 01:29:14.015
how we can perhaps use Medicaid

01:29:14.082 --> 01:29:17.452
dollars the fund people who are

01:29:17.518 --> 01:29:18.119
medically fragile living on the

01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:18.653
street so we can begin to

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:21.489
address. Those red and yellow

01:29:21.556 --> 01:29:22.123
areas so thinking creatively

01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:25.359
general fund dollars to prop

01:29:25.426 --> 01:29:25.960
sixty three dollars how do we

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:29.497
make that the dollars fit the

01:29:29.564 --> 01:29:30.064
need today. I think it's an

01:29:30.131 --> 01:29:33.835
important thing to do. And if I

01:29:33.901 --> 01:29:34.402
may senator Mitchell just a

01:29:34.469 --> 01:29:35.036
quick response I think a slow

01:29:35.103 --> 01:29:37.739
boil is the perfect

01:29:37.805 --> 01:29:38.372
description. For what we find

01:29:38.439 --> 01:29:42.076
ourselves in right now. And

01:29:42.143 --> 01:29:42.744
just let me tell you I couldn't

01:29:42.810 --> 01:29:43.311
care less about sexy grand

01:29:43.377 --> 01:29:46.314
openings I'd rather not even

01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:46.948
have them at all. We just need

01:29:47.014 --> 01:29:47.548
to get people under our roof

01:29:47.615 --> 01:29:50.785
and that is my focus. But at at

01:29:50.852 --> 01:29:54.589
I just want to say that. Nguyen

01:29:54.655 --> 01:29:55.223
polling comes out the shows 95%

01:29:55.289 --> 01:29:58.826
of Angelinos at the top concern

01:29:58.893 --> 01:29:59.393
is homelessness. I think we

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:02.897
could all be involved in

01:30:02.964 --> 01:30:03.498
incorporated included in that

01:30:03.564 --> 01:30:07.101
95% I can for sure. But what

01:30:07.168 --> 01:30:07.702
polling does it makes elected

01:30:07.769 --> 01:30:11.172
officials nervous so what I

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:11.806
think we need to do is. We have

01:30:11.873 --> 01:30:12.406
to stay the course and make

01:30:12.473 --> 01:30:15.710
adjustments along the way. We

01:30:15.777 --> 01:30:16.377
just talked about- collectively

01:30:16.444 --> 01:30:19.914
the successes we're making I am

01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:20.448
not going to second guess

01:30:20.515 --> 01:30:23.851
public perception. I respected

01:30:23.918 --> 01:30:27.855
I get it I understand it. Up

01:30:27.922 --> 01:30:28.556
Bob. As leaders we also have to

01:30:28.623 --> 01:30:32.393
make sure that what we know

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:33.027
we're succeeding in. We stick

01:30:33.094 --> 01:30:36.297
with. That what we know we need

01:30:36.364 --> 01:30:36.898
to tighten up a re visit or

01:30:36.964 --> 01:30:40.368
retool we also do that. Along

01:30:40.434 --> 01:30:41.035
the way. Because I feel that in

01:30:41.102 --> 01:30:44.839
a year's time when we have two

01:30:44.906 --> 01:30:45.439
thousand new units of opening

01:30:45.506 --> 01:30:46.040
up and- people experiencing

01:30:46.107 --> 01:30:48.943
homelessness actually moving

01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:49.577
and getting house. Long term

01:30:49.644 --> 01:30:53.047
indefinitely. That public

01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:53.714
perception will slowly begin to

01:30:53.781 --> 01:30:57.084
change. But I'm not sitting

01:30:57.151 --> 01:30:57.652
here concerned with public

01:30:57.718 --> 01:31:01.222
perception right now. I I'm

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:01.823
concerned with achieving the

01:31:01.889 --> 01:31:05.760
will. Voter from to have three

01:31:05.827 --> 01:31:09.831
years ago. And the concern of

01:31:09.897 --> 01:31:10.431
majority eventually knows how

01:31:10.498 --> 01:31:14.035
to get ready. Under Dân of

01:31:14.101 --> 01:31:18.005
have I respect that. A long

01:31:18.072 --> 01:31:18.639
term what we need to do in this

01:31:18.706 --> 01:31:19.073
window where we are

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:19.707
experiencing surplus is at the

01:31:19.774 --> 01:31:22.476
St Paul. Is we have to address

01:31:22.543 --> 01:31:23.077
some of the fundamentals that

01:31:23.144 --> 01:31:23.644
we we've always ignored as

01:31:23.711 --> 01:31:24.278
well. I'm sure of a committee

01:31:24.345 --> 01:31:26.447
call homelessness and poverty

01:31:26.514 --> 01:31:27.048
we held a poverty summit for

01:31:27.114 --> 01:31:27.648
the very first time. In the

01:31:27.715 --> 01:31:30.852
city's history in September. We

01:31:30.918 --> 01:31:31.452
are going to take a look and

01:31:31.519 --> 01:31:34.889
we're we're expecting a report

01:31:34.956 --> 01:31:35.523
from that summit was extremely

01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:38.793
well attended it was a great.

01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:39.393
Yeah elle wonderful day long

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:42.864
event with all of the folks the

01:31:42.930 --> 01:31:43.464
knowledge base of the lived

01:31:43.531 --> 01:31:44.098
experience. Of the experiences

01:31:44.165 --> 01:31:47.368
of non profits and leaders in

01:31:47.435 --> 01:31:48.002
this industry we're expecting a

01:31:48.069 --> 01:31:51.706
report I want to turn that into

01:31:51.772 --> 01:31:52.340
city policy. We know where the

01:31:52.406 --> 01:31:55.610
pockets of poverty always have

01:31:55.676 --> 01:31:56.143
been we also know that we

01:31:56.210 --> 01:31:59.580
always neglected to address

01:31:59.647 --> 01:32:00.248
that. So we need to focus it is

01:32:00.314 --> 01:32:00.882
to be an all in focus. Eviction

01:32:00.948 --> 01:32:04.151
prevention- I've more vouchers

01:32:04.218 --> 01:32:04.785
so that we can get people in

01:32:04.852 --> 01:32:08.189
the housing keep people house

01:32:08.256 --> 01:32:08.756
and build. It's an all in

01:32:08.823 --> 01:32:12.460
approach let me jump ahead just

01:32:12.526 --> 01:32:13.094
so everybody gets that ask some

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:16.631
questions. I want Mister Mister

01:32:16.697 --> 01:32:20.668
Hertzberg Mister Gibson and

01:32:20.735 --> 01:32:24.705
then I could also please. Thank.

01:32:24.772 --> 01:32:25.239
Thank you or contact with

01:32:25.306 --> 01:32:29.043
several the- road to urgency in

01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:29.610
my judgment. Is government

01:32:29.677 --> 01:32:33.347
owned land. The testimony here

01:32:33.414 --> 01:32:37.318
today was there's thirty

01:32:37.385 --> 01:32:37.952
thousand folks that are willing

01:32:38.019 --> 01:32:41.389
to step to take apart take

01:32:41.455 --> 01:32:45.526
housing we have is Mr Murray

01:32:45.593 --> 01:32:46.093
suggested service resistant

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:46.661
let's focus on the near term

01:32:46.727 --> 01:32:49.964
deliverable. Why government

01:32:50.031 --> 01:32:50.531
owned land one we're dealing

01:32:50.598 --> 01:32:53.868
with the big issue

01:32:53.935 --> 01:32:54.502
affordability we live in a part

01:32:54.568 --> 01:32:55.136
of the country where things are

01:32:55.202 --> 01:32:58.239
quite expensive. If government

01:32:58.306 --> 01:32:58.839
can can lease the land for a

01:32:58.906 --> 01:33:02.410
dollar a year deals with

01:33:02.476 --> 01:33:03.010
reducing rents reducing costs

01:33:03.077 --> 01:33:06.414
to taxpayers in affordability.

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:10.618
So second. In the budget

01:33:10.685 --> 01:33:11.285
trailer bill SB was at one on

01:33:11.352 --> 01:33:14.989
one and German I think. Is the

01:33:15.056 --> 01:33:15.523
idea that we expedited the

01:33:15.589 --> 01:33:19.293
process for these- navigation

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:22.997
centers in terms of security

01:33:23.064 --> 01:33:23.597
you certainly what we've done

01:33:23.664 --> 01:33:24.165
with respect Mister Santiago

01:33:24.231 --> 01:33:27.234
spill. So we have informed

01:33:27.301 --> 01:33:27.802
government policy informed

01:33:27.868 --> 01:33:31.539
approach that is are less

01:33:31.605 --> 01:33:32.006
expensive- critically

01:33:32.073 --> 01:33:35.710
affordability is a big issue.

01:33:35.776 --> 01:33:36.310
And certainly the government

01:33:36.377 --> 01:33:36.911
policy at the state level the

01:33:36.978 --> 01:33:40.081
speed to market to get this

01:33:40.147 --> 01:33:40.715
stuff built as fast as possible

01:33:40.781 --> 01:33:44.251
or whatever the issues if you

01:33:44.318 --> 01:33:44.852
know how we approach it. We

01:33:44.919 --> 01:33:48.289
know from the work that we've

01:33:48.356 --> 01:33:48.856
done with the city of Los

01:33:48.923 --> 01:33:49.390
Angeles through the city

01:33:49.457 --> 01:33:52.493
administrative officer the city

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:52.994
owns born twenty eight

01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:53.594
partials. We don't know what

01:33:53.661 --> 01:33:56.764
the school district has because

01:33:56.831 --> 01:33:57.398
we've been trying to get it we

01:33:57.465 --> 01:33:58.032
haven't figured out we all of

01:33:58.099 --> 01:34:01.068
our two thousand less students

01:34:01.135 --> 01:34:01.669
we know have some projects we

01:34:01.736 --> 01:34:04.872
just visitors from the been

01:34:04.939 --> 01:34:05.473
quite successful with respect

01:34:05.539 --> 01:34:06.107
to the- districts. Don't know

01:34:06.173 --> 01:34:06.674
what the county has in the

01:34:06.741 --> 01:34:09.310
stories that I've heard with

01:34:09.377 --> 01:34:09.877
rate to innovation is maybe

01:34:09.944 --> 01:34:10.511
something's missed supervisor

01:34:10.578 --> 01:34:13.414
talk about but some folks in

01:34:13.481 --> 01:34:14.081
the San Fernando Valley pay and

01:34:14.148 --> 01:34:17.184
three and four thousand dollars

01:34:17.251 --> 01:34:17.718
to the county for. County

01:34:17.785 --> 01:34:18.386
property is rent with it should

01:34:18.452 --> 01:34:21.389
be a dollar because it's

01:34:21.455 --> 01:34:21.956
government owned land which

01:34:22.023 --> 01:34:22.490
taught follow up on that I

01:34:22.556 --> 01:34:25.626
probably don't know about that.

01:34:25.693 --> 01:34:26.227
But but the idea is that they

01:34:26.293 --> 01:34:30.064
should focus. Of my office.

01:34:30.131 --> 01:34:33.968
Physically with the operation

01:34:34.035 --> 01:34:34.502
three thousand one. Forty

01:34:34.568 --> 01:34:35.136
portions of government land in

01:34:35.202 --> 01:34:35.736
the San Fernando Valley we've

01:34:35.803 --> 01:34:36.370
identified a number for the Ste

01:34:36.437 --> 01:34:37.004
for the for the that the state

01:34:37.071 --> 01:34:38.506
owns. And we know that the

01:34:38.572 --> 01:34:39.106
governor was supposed to come

01:34:39.173 --> 01:34:42.476
up with an emergency reported

01:34:42.543 --> 01:34:43.110
don't know on September with

01:34:43.177 --> 01:34:43.711
respect to their- looking at

01:34:43.778 --> 01:34:46.680
state property. The bottom line

01:34:46.747 --> 01:34:47.314
is that we a flexibility. We

01:34:47.381 --> 01:34:50.718
have league we've already

01:34:50.785 --> 01:34:51.252
demonstrated that legally

01:34:51.318 --> 01:34:51.819
through the actions of the

01:34:51.886 --> 01:34:54.789
budget chair. And the governor-

01:34:54.855 --> 01:34:55.423
we certainly can do this and so

01:34:55.489 --> 01:34:56.057
my only suggestion is and what

01:34:56.123 --> 01:34:59.427
I last both the city and the

01:34:59.493 --> 01:35:00.094
county that are here today. Is

01:35:00.161 --> 01:35:03.097
what are you doing in that

01:35:03.164 --> 01:35:03.697
regard. To take advantage of

01:35:03.764 --> 01:35:07.334
these extraordinary

01:35:07.401 --> 01:35:07.935
opportunities to be able to.

01:35:08.002 --> 01:35:11.572
Get folks off the street. And

01:35:11.639 --> 01:35:12.206
get greater opportunity quickly

01:35:12.273 --> 01:35:15.810
to make this happen I know that

01:35:15.876 --> 01:35:16.477
when you came to our meeting at

01:35:16.544 --> 01:35:19.814
the LA county- delegation

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:20.381
talked about some ideas of

01:35:20.448 --> 01:35:21.015
using parks with respect each

01:35:21.082 --> 01:35:24.318
districts- and the like. But it

01:35:24.385 --> 01:35:24.952
I just think that that if we

01:35:25.019 --> 01:35:28.489
could. We have to show action.

01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:32.660
The fact that in favor of fair

01:35:32.726 --> 01:35:33.327
that this has been a slow boil.

01:35:33.394 --> 01:35:36.997
Fair that that the rate is was

01:35:37.064 --> 01:35:37.598
just express. Of people coming

01:35:37.665 --> 01:35:40.868
in is greater. Get a life big

01:35:40.935 --> 01:35:41.502
deal our jobs to figure it out

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:45.172
and fix it next case. So you

01:35:45.239 --> 01:35:49.343
know to me he- I'd like to hear

01:35:49.410 --> 01:35:49.977
some insights with respect to

01:35:50.044 --> 01:35:53.114
both the city. And the county

01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:53.747
as it relates to those policies

01:35:53.814 --> 01:35:54.348
what efforts you're engaged in

01:35:54.415 --> 01:36:05.860
that regard. Okay. Have a quick

01:36:05.926 --> 01:36:06.527
closing towards in and I know I

01:36:06.594 --> 01:36:10.097
know Christina Miller has to

01:36:10.164 --> 01:36:10.698
leave now represent the mayor

01:36:10.764 --> 01:36:11.232
so thank you very much for

01:36:11.298 --> 01:36:11.832
participation thank you thank

01:36:11.899 --> 01:36:14.368
you very much yeah I can just

01:36:14.435 --> 01:36:14.935
quickly speak to some of the

01:36:15.002 --> 01:36:15.469
work the city is doing on

01:36:15.536 --> 01:36:16.036
leveraging public publicly

01:36:16.103 --> 01:36:16.704
owned land because you're right

01:36:16.770 --> 01:36:18.539
there is cost savings there

01:36:18.606 --> 01:36:19.173
that can bring down the cost of

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:19.773
development that is that is

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:22.610
critical at fifty parcels of

01:36:22.676 --> 01:36:23.210
those surplus parcels senator

01:36:23.277 --> 01:36:26.981
that you mentioned in the city

01:36:27.047 --> 01:36:27.615
were put out to bid as part of

01:36:27.681 --> 01:36:30.818
our triple H. program so

01:36:30.885 --> 01:36:31.318
developers were able to

01:36:31.385 --> 01:36:31.952
leverage the cost of the valued

01:36:32.019 --> 01:36:35.289
land. I'm in the city and you

01:36:35.356 --> 01:36:35.723
know provided it for

01:36:35.789 --> 01:36:39.293
development with a ninety nine

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:39.894
year ground lease. And at and

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:47.535
with. And. I the bill will not

01:36:47.601 --> 01:36:48.102
I don't yeah I'm good radios

01:36:48.169 --> 01:36:55.809
with. I used to you did manage.

01:36:55.876 --> 01:36:56.410
Yeah yeah I'm also to share

01:36:56.477 --> 01:36:56.977
with the average I'm program

01:36:57.044 --> 01:36:59.914
two thirds of those AB projects

01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:00.581
are on a publicly owned land as

01:37:00.648 --> 01:37:04.018
well I'm including Caltrans and

01:37:04.084 --> 01:37:04.585
metro land and city owned

01:37:04.652 --> 01:37:05.085
parking lots that were

01:37:05.152 --> 01:37:05.686
identified as good for parcels

01:37:05.753 --> 01:37:08.422
for that use so could agree

01:37:08.489 --> 01:37:09.056
more I think in the governor's

01:37:09.123 --> 01:37:09.590
report and that is either

01:37:09.657 --> 01:37:10.257
forthcoming or that has already

01:37:10.324 --> 01:37:12.860
been released it there is

01:37:12.927 --> 01:37:13.494
minimal state surplus property

01:37:13.561 --> 01:37:16.630
that's been identified in LA

01:37:16.697 --> 01:37:17.198
city I think it's something

01:37:17.264 --> 01:37:17.665
around two properties

01:37:17.731 --> 01:37:21.001
unfortunately I'm- but we

01:37:21.068 --> 01:37:21.602
always while twenty one in the

01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:22.203
county to in the city. I think

01:37:22.269 --> 01:37:24.939
we ended cut that coincide with

01:37:25.005 --> 01:37:25.439
opportunities. We always

01:37:25.506 --> 01:37:26.006
welcome any other you know

01:37:26.073 --> 01:37:29.210
public entities that are

01:37:29.276 --> 01:37:29.843
willing to leverage their land

01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:33.447
for I'm homeless housing and

01:37:33.514 --> 01:37:34.048
shelter or programming we are

01:37:34.114 --> 01:37:37.484
completely open to that idea.

01:37:37.551 --> 01:37:38.085
So think thank you very much

01:37:38.152 --> 01:37:41.755
thank you very much I'm handed

01:37:41.822 --> 01:37:42.356
over to Mister Gibson just. A

01:37:42.423 --> 01:37:46.060
sailor let's. A brief it up and

01:37:46.126 --> 01:37:46.660
then a- Mister nozzle because

01:37:46.727 --> 01:37:50.264
we still got one panel sure and

01:37:50.331 --> 01:37:50.864
I appreciate- although spoken

01:37:50.931 --> 01:37:54.301
thus far- I went think. I want

01:37:54.368 --> 01:37:54.902
to say that I actually did the

01:37:54.969 --> 01:37:55.536
bill that allow the- city of

01:37:55.603 --> 01:37:58.239
Los Angeles and the San Jose

01:37:58.305 --> 01:37:58.906
to. Have up to ten. Parcel of

01:37:58.973 --> 01:38:02.610
land to Caltrans in the

01:38:02.676 --> 01:38:03.210
governor brown signed as was

01:38:03.277 --> 01:38:03.744
the Los andjelkovic rents

01:38:03.811 --> 01:38:07.047
property- that you can build on

01:38:07.114 --> 01:38:10.918
for one dollar. A year for

01:38:10.985 --> 01:38:14.922
housing transitional- purposes-

01:38:14.989 --> 01:38:15.589
with everything is being said I

01:38:15.656 --> 01:38:16.223
am convinced we have a state of

01:38:16.290 --> 01:38:19.526
emergency. And it will work

01:38:19.593 --> 01:38:20.094
clear coat that point and I

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:23.797
want to for the- purpose of the

01:38:23.864 --> 01:38:27.434
senators- we have significant

01:38:27.501 --> 01:38:28.068
amount of money. In our rating

01:38:28.135 --> 01:38:31.939
day fund. That all that we have

01:38:32.006 --> 01:38:32.573
to clear state of emergency in

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:33.207
order to access it. That money

01:38:33.274 --> 01:38:36.143
is used for a state of

01:38:36.210 --> 01:38:36.744
emergency because as senator

01:38:36.810 --> 01:38:37.244
Mitchell indicating the

01:38:37.311 --> 01:38:40.347
pendulum will swing both ways

01:38:40.414 --> 01:38:44.218
or maybe robust right now.

01:38:44.285 --> 01:38:44.852
Right who's to say what will

01:38:44.918 --> 01:38:48.355
happen in the next couple years

01:38:48.422 --> 01:38:48.956
and I'm strongly suggesting.

01:38:49.023 --> 01:38:52.793
That we use some of the money-

01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:53.394
that we have in our rainy day

01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:57.064
fund to address the emergency

01:38:57.131 --> 01:38:57.698
that's in front of us. And so I

01:38:57.765 --> 01:39:00.934
want to be able to get begin to

01:39:01.001 --> 01:39:01.568
at least have a conversation my

01:39:01.635 --> 01:39:02.036
colleagues. About the

01:39:02.102 --> 01:39:05.339
possibilities of that and also

01:39:05.406 --> 01:39:05.973
looking at other- as senator

01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:09.410
Hertzberg indicated- government

01:39:09.476 --> 01:39:10.044
owned property because I think

01:39:10.110 --> 01:39:13.614
that's the best way to go. To

01:39:13.681 --> 01:39:14.214
address some immediate needs

01:39:14.281 --> 01:39:17.885
right now- in addition to that

01:39:17.951 --> 01:39:18.519
I'm going to conclude on this

01:39:18.585 --> 01:39:21.689
note- chair Santiago that I

01:39:21.755 --> 01:39:22.356
think that we need to also look

01:39:22.423 --> 01:39:26.026
at how do we one be able to.

01:39:26.093 --> 01:39:30.531
Gets and deal with the sequel-

01:39:30.597 --> 01:39:31.065
that is causing what I'm

01:39:31.131 --> 01:39:34.635
hearing- developers who have

01:39:34.702 --> 01:39:35.235
the option to develop but is

01:39:35.302 --> 01:39:38.806
being backlog or delayed- three

01:39:38.872 --> 01:39:42.810
years we don't have three years

01:39:42.876 --> 01:39:43.477
away first step to be built. We

01:39:43.544 --> 01:39:46.814
need it to be built right now

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:47.381
with the a greater sense of

01:39:47.448 --> 01:39:51.051
urgency and so that's my

01:39:51.118 --> 01:39:51.652
comments and I'll conclude on

01:39:51.719 --> 01:39:55.422
that note. Yes thank you Mister

01:39:55.489 --> 01:39:59.426
Gibson. I don't need a thank

01:39:59.493 --> 01:40:00.094
you everybody I don't need of a

01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:00.694
full response to this but if

01:40:00.761 --> 01:40:03.797
there's information that can be

01:40:03.864 --> 01:40:04.431
shared with us on the issue of

01:40:04.498 --> 01:40:07.701
mental health services- that

01:40:07.768 --> 01:40:11.872
was not addressed- earlier when

01:40:11.939 --> 01:40:12.473
a- on the whole range of the

01:40:12.539 --> 01:40:16.210
deaths and the causes of death

01:40:16.276 --> 01:40:20.047
and the intersection of mental

01:40:20.114 --> 01:40:24.284
health illness with- the

01:40:24.351 --> 01:40:24.918
deaths. That are current on our

01:40:24.985 --> 01:40:25.552
streets so. Somewhere how does

01:40:25.619 --> 01:40:28.889
the issue of mental health

01:40:28.956 --> 01:40:32.926
services- get. It should be

01:40:32.993 --> 01:40:36.930
given. The priority that it

01:40:36.997 --> 01:40:37.498
deserves but I don't know I

01:40:37.564 --> 01:40:41.001
don't have the information.

01:40:41.068 --> 01:40:41.668
It's just sort of instinct it

01:40:41.735 --> 01:40:45.406
mental health issues keep

01:40:45.472 --> 01:40:46.006
coming up on the state level-

01:40:46.073 --> 01:40:49.309
by many organizations

01:40:49.376 --> 01:40:49.943
throughout the state especially

01:40:50.010 --> 01:40:53.747
our younger- men and women and

01:40:53.814 --> 01:40:57.751
our children are used- the

01:40:57.818 --> 01:41:02.022
suicide- issues- it's shocking

01:41:02.089 --> 01:41:06.026
to think that in our state this

01:41:06.093 --> 01:41:06.627
would be a gross an area of

01:41:06.693 --> 01:41:07.227
growth in our in our community

01:41:07.294 --> 01:41:10.531
so. You know if there is

01:41:10.597 --> 01:41:11.131
information that helps inform

01:41:11.198 --> 01:41:14.668
us. A one and that we do

01:41:14.735 --> 01:41:18.672
everything that we can do

01:41:18.739 --> 01:41:19.339
continue mental health services

01:41:19.406 --> 01:41:23.110
in fact increase mental health

01:41:23.177 --> 01:41:23.744
services and that that not be

01:41:23.811 --> 01:41:27.181
sacrificed. For the issue of

01:41:27.247 --> 01:41:31.151
housing- I think that's a

01:41:31.218 --> 01:41:31.752
really important issue were a

01:41:31.819 --> 01:41:35.456
have a situation and are my own

01:41:35.522 --> 01:41:36.089
district right now on that but

01:41:36.156 --> 01:41:39.593
we shouldn't have one or the

01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:40.194
other we shouldn't sacrifice

01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:43.730
one or the other we need a we

01:41:43.797 --> 01:41:44.431
need both so that's that's one.

01:41:44.498 --> 01:41:48.202
And second is as I mentioned

01:41:48.268 --> 01:41:51.872
earlier the issue of economic

01:41:51.939 --> 01:41:52.473
development is so important

01:41:52.539 --> 01:41:56.443
here we will move our sisters

01:41:56.510 --> 01:42:00.247
and brothers to the point of

01:42:00.314 --> 01:42:00.881
getting a job. Because that's

01:42:00.948 --> 01:42:01.515
the only way they're going to

01:42:01.582 --> 01:42:04.818
sustain themselves and we as

01:42:04.885 --> 01:42:08.489
government should not think

01:42:08.555 --> 01:42:09.122
that forever now up return IT

01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:12.926
we're going to have to do the

01:42:12.993 --> 01:42:13.560
subsidies to keep families of

01:42:13.627 --> 01:42:17.297
float that's not the way our

01:42:17.364 --> 01:42:21.101
economy should function so I

01:42:21.168 --> 01:42:21.735
think we also need to make the

01:42:21.802 --> 01:42:25.172
connection LA was the first-

01:42:25.239 --> 01:42:25.839
make the city in the country to

01:42:25.906 --> 01:42:29.409
pass a living wage ordinance.

01:42:29.476 --> 01:42:30.077
We don't have issues of living

01:42:30.143 --> 01:42:34.014
wages come up in this con and

01:42:34.081 --> 01:42:34.615
that's really the is a major

01:42:34.681 --> 01:42:38.085
issue to keep families from

01:42:38.151 --> 01:42:42.022
becoming homeless so. With a

01:42:42.089 --> 01:42:42.623
lot of connecting of the dots

01:42:42.689 --> 01:42:46.093
but if we don't we and the

01:42:46.159 --> 01:42:46.760
solving a problem here and it's

01:42:46.827 --> 01:42:47.361
getting worse over here. Just

01:42:47.427 --> 01:42:50.597
comments. Just a brief word in

01:42:50.664 --> 01:42:51.198
terms of the mental health

01:42:51.265 --> 01:42:54.868
work. Of the state of the art

01:42:54.935 --> 01:42:55.435
activity that's going on in

01:42:55.502 --> 01:42:58.906
that area is behavioral health

01:42:58.972 --> 01:42:59.573
centers. That what's the it was

01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:02.809
the original Martin at the king

01:43:02.876 --> 01:43:03.410
hospital five hundred thousand

01:43:03.477 --> 01:43:04.044
square feet. Is now going to be

01:43:04.111 --> 01:43:07.080
a state of the art. Behavioral

01:43:07.147 --> 01:43:11.151
health center. Loading and-

01:43:11.218 --> 01:43:11.685
best practices and mental

01:43:11.752 --> 01:43:15.422
health. Of the notion of mental

01:43:15.489 --> 01:43:15.989
health urgent centers much

01:43:16.056 --> 01:43:19.660
smaller- facilities the issue

01:43:19.726 --> 01:43:20.160
of the kindred issue of.

01:43:20.227 --> 01:43:23.830
Addictive services cold current

01:43:23.897 --> 01:43:24.398
disorder is a lot of that's

01:43:24.464 --> 01:43:28.201
going on- senator be glad to

01:43:28.268 --> 01:43:28.735
provide you with as much

01:43:28.802 --> 01:43:32.306
information as- the county has.

01:43:32.372 --> 01:43:36.410
Of the director is John Sharon

01:43:36.476 --> 01:43:36.944
I think he's to be here a

01:43:37.010 --> 01:43:40.480
little later- he's fully

01:43:40.547 --> 01:43:41.081
capable and that but- offices

01:43:41.148 --> 01:43:44.818
at your disposal to provide you

01:43:44.885 --> 01:43:45.419
with much information. Would

01:43:45.485 --> 01:43:48.589
talk about a restorative

01:43:48.655 --> 01:43:49.222
village- at LA see USC Medical

01:43:49.289 --> 01:43:53.226
Center souls a lot going on in

01:43:53.293 --> 01:43:53.827
terms of. Stated the are the

01:43:53.894 --> 01:43:57.230
county. Is seen as a leading

01:43:57.297 --> 01:43:57.864
the way in the state among all

01:43:57.931 --> 01:44:01.335
county the county of Los

01:44:01.401 --> 01:44:01.935
Angeles. And yet I want to re

01:44:02.002 --> 01:44:05.305
assert we have a lot of work.

01:44:05.372 --> 01:44:05.906
To do- miss job we should the

01:44:05.973 --> 01:44:09.843
opportunity to be here and-

01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:10.344
speak to the- panel and

01:44:10.410 --> 01:44:13.914
certainly want to continue this

01:44:13.981 --> 01:44:14.548
dialogue and will use it to the

01:44:14.615 --> 01:44:17.985
appropriate. Short now I want

01:44:18.051 --> 01:44:18.585
to thank you for being here I

01:44:18.652 --> 01:44:19.219
want to thank you you too dumb

01:44:19.286 --> 01:44:22.389
as well for being here. And as

01:44:22.456 --> 01:44:22.990
public servants no the press

01:44:23.056 --> 01:44:23.624
that a incredibly pressing on

01:44:23.690 --> 01:44:26.460
your time to. Dedicate an

01:44:26.526 --> 01:44:27.060
entire morning to it but but I

01:44:27.127 --> 01:44:30.364
know that use the same words to

01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:34.735
see if we do. And. You know

01:44:34.801 --> 01:44:35.369
that for my call one wrapped up

01:44:35.435 --> 01:44:38.972
to the next. But when I say

01:44:39.039 --> 01:44:39.573
something that Mister- feral

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:43.243
had mentioned and I think. I

01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:43.844
appreciate the Paula came out

01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:44.511
because it what we already knew.

01:44:44.578 --> 01:44:47.314
Your past. And they're angry

01:44:47.381 --> 01:44:47.881
and they're frustrated about

01:44:47.948 --> 01:44:48.515
about the homeless a situation

01:44:48.582 --> 01:44:49.082
and if they haven't lost

01:44:49.149 --> 01:44:49.650
confidence or losing it very

01:44:49.716 --> 01:44:51.618
very very quickly. I think it's

01:44:51.685 --> 01:44:52.219
fair to say look I'm passed. I

01:44:52.285 --> 01:44:52.819
mean there's a person in this

01:44:52.886 --> 01:44:55.689
room. Was an upset frustrated-

01:44:55.756 --> 01:44:59.660
but again I want to thank also

01:44:59.726 --> 01:45:00.293
that we're not in an exercise a

01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:00.894
finger pointing I think we've

01:45:00.961 --> 01:45:01.495
come to the conclusion that.

01:45:01.561 --> 01:45:03.997
That bigger points on could

01:45:04.064 --> 01:45:04.531
help right I mean it's not

01:45:04.598 --> 01:45:05.165
going to solve anything it sexy

01:45:05.232 --> 01:45:07.968
it. But you know blow the

01:45:08.035 --> 01:45:08.568
whistle you get a quick press

01:45:08.635 --> 01:45:09.136
said. The world workers in

01:45:09.202 --> 01:45:12.105
challenging challenging each

01:45:12.172 --> 01:45:12.639
other to. To break down

01:45:12.706 --> 01:45:16.410
obstacles to get this- the get

01:45:16.476 --> 01:45:16.943
this is this humanitarian

01:45:17.010 --> 01:45:17.511
crisis under control I think

01:45:17.577 --> 01:45:20.580
it's fair to say we can call it

01:45:20.647 --> 01:45:21.248
a public health crisis has been

01:45:21.314 --> 01:45:21.848
denied- you because they have

01:45:21.915 --> 01:45:24.918
to be- has to be taken a look

01:45:24.985 --> 01:45:28.855
at like a public health crisis.

01:45:28.922 --> 01:45:29.456
It is a state of emergency. It

01:45:29.523 --> 01:45:33.293
in and I'll tell you I think

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:33.927
it's one that that needs to be.

01:45:33.994 --> 01:45:37.097
Attacked in a compassionate way

01:45:37.164 --> 01:45:37.664
so when I say that that I'm

01:45:37.731 --> 01:45:41.401
angry. It comes from a sense of

01:45:41.468 --> 01:45:42.035
compassion because we have now

01:45:42.102 --> 01:45:42.669
we've got to figure out how to

01:45:42.736 --> 01:45:45.672
do this if the least among us

01:45:45.739 --> 01:45:46.306
doesn't have. A roof over their

01:45:46.373 --> 01:45:49.843
head food in their mouth- away

01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:50.410
to care for their kids and

01:45:50.477 --> 01:45:51.011
we've we've certainly failed

01:45:51.078 --> 01:45:54.014
society. And animal and a

01:45:54.081 --> 01:45:58.085
multiple ways. Look I we put

01:45:58.151 --> 01:45:58.652
together a list of what the

01:45:58.719 --> 01:45:59.186
state has done. And it's

01:45:59.252 --> 01:46:02.222
expensive and the reason I put

01:46:02.289 --> 01:46:02.823
this list together- our folks

01:46:02.889 --> 01:46:03.356
put together one of the

01:46:03.423 --> 01:46:06.226
governor's office it is it is.

01:46:06.293 --> 01:46:06.827
To make that point that had

01:46:06.893 --> 01:46:10.564
been made by- many of you

01:46:10.630 --> 01:46:11.198
there- that we've got to figure

01:46:11.264 --> 01:46:11.865
out a way to blow up the system

01:46:11.932 --> 01:46:14.968
and start a love in a way that

01:46:15.035 --> 01:46:15.569
actually addresses- the very

01:46:15.635 --> 01:46:19.039
contact points that help

01:46:19.106 --> 01:46:19.539
people. Because we keep

01:46:19.606 --> 01:46:23.043
throwing money at this problem.

01:46:23.110 --> 01:46:23.643
And at some point time we got

01:46:23.710 --> 01:46:24.144
to figure out the most

01:46:24.211 --> 01:46:27.114
effective use of those dollars.

01:46:27.180 --> 01:46:27.714
And all point that this and I

01:46:27.781 --> 01:46:28.348
know miss Mitchell knows this

01:46:28.415 --> 01:46:31.284
inside and now. But when you

01:46:31.351 --> 01:46:31.852
take a look at some of the

01:46:31.918 --> 01:46:32.552
dollars that a bit that we keep

01:46:32.619 --> 01:46:33.186
putting at this. It's the and

01:46:33.253 --> 01:46:35.889
at the state level we can go

01:46:35.956 --> 01:46:36.523
from emergency. Solutions grant

01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:39.993
and you guys should all have it

01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:40.527
in your in your- in your

01:46:40.594 --> 01:46:41.161
notebook and we'll take a look

01:46:41.228 --> 01:46:44.231
at. A sixty two million this

01:46:44.297 --> 01:46:44.831
year the housing and homeless

01:46:44.898 --> 01:46:48.034
prevention- seventy. Three

01:46:48.101 --> 01:46:48.668
hundred and seventy million was

01:46:48.735 --> 01:46:52.139
appropriate two hundred and

01:46:52.205 --> 01:46:52.773
seventy million left. No place

01:46:52.839 --> 01:46:53.340
like home- we got about two

01:46:53.406 --> 01:46:56.409
billion coming down the

01:46:56.476 --> 01:46:57.043
pipeline. Cal words that sound

01:46:57.110 --> 01:46:57.611
like I'm reading your report

01:46:57.677 --> 01:47:00.881
right- hundred and- twenty four

01:47:00.947 --> 01:47:01.448
million last year what this

01:47:01.515 --> 01:47:05.051
year- the multi family. Housing

01:47:05.118 --> 01:47:08.922
I mean go on and on it's a two

01:47:08.989 --> 01:47:09.523
hundred seventy seven million.

01:47:09.589 --> 01:47:13.460
The. Five million to address

01:47:13.527 --> 01:47:14.060
homelessness within the act of

01:47:14.127 --> 01:47:14.694
two thousand eighteen out five

01:47:14.761 --> 01:47:15.295
hundred million. Five hundred

01:47:15.362 --> 01:47:17.564
million it's this year at six

01:47:17.631 --> 01:47:18.198
hundred and fifty million. And

01:47:18.265 --> 01:47:21.635
I go on and on and on and the

01:47:21.701 --> 01:47:22.235
millions and millions of we

01:47:22.302 --> 01:47:22.869
start adding it up. I've been

01:47:22.936 --> 01:47:23.503
added it up but for somebody.

01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:25.939
But my guess is by about four

01:47:26.006 --> 01:47:26.540
to five billion at the state

01:47:26.606 --> 01:47:27.174
stone in over the last couple

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:30.010
of years in one. Way or the

01:47:30.076 --> 01:47:30.610
other. But you know it's also

01:47:30.677 --> 01:47:31.211
daunting is if we don't keep

01:47:31.278 --> 01:47:34.214
drumming that beat we're not

01:47:34.281 --> 01:47:34.848
going to create that sort of

01:47:34.915 --> 01:47:38.218
excitement as sort of- fury to

01:47:38.285 --> 01:47:38.785
get this stuff done out. Of

01:47:38.852 --> 01:47:39.386
talking my colleague earlier.

01:47:39.452 --> 01:47:42.422
But three years ago. Our caucus

01:47:42.489 --> 01:47:43.023
took a poll of what more the

01:47:43.089 --> 01:47:46.426
most important issues. It was a

01:47:46.493 --> 01:47:47.027
scientific poll which is kind

01:47:47.093 --> 01:47:47.594
of. You know we all got to

01:47:47.661 --> 01:47:48.228
stick as we one put up. I think

01:47:48.295 --> 01:47:50.697
of like maybe one third of. The

01:47:50.764 --> 01:47:51.231
members in that room at.

01:47:51.298 --> 01:47:51.865
Thought that homelessness is

01:47:51.932 --> 01:47:54.801
even an important problem. One

01:47:54.868 --> 01:47:55.468
third while some of us were put

01:47:55.535 --> 01:47:56.136
in both of our stickers on that

01:47:56.203 --> 01:47:56.670
and- try to steal someone

01:47:56.736 --> 01:47:59.239
else's sticker to make it. To

01:47:59.306 --> 01:47:59.840
make it more of an important

01:47:59.906 --> 01:48:00.440
issue but that's the kind of

01:48:00.507 --> 01:48:03.210
work we got ahead of us number

01:48:03.276 --> 01:48:03.877
one it's- it's convincing on. A

01:48:03.944 --> 01:48:07.247
convincing. Everybody around as

01:48:07.314 --> 01:48:07.881
a we got a knock down all those

01:48:07.948 --> 01:48:08.515
beers even if it's painful to

01:48:08.582 --> 01:48:11.418
ourselves I want to thank you-

01:48:11.484 --> 01:48:12.018
to da. Are you done in there

01:48:12.085 --> 01:48:12.686
and other the mayor's office to

01:48:12.752 --> 01:48:15.622
Cristina for helping us to. Try

01:48:15.689 --> 01:48:16.256
to figure that out I think next

01:48:16.323 --> 01:48:16.890
year- have will be. Taken out

01:48:16.957 --> 01:48:20.060
that sledgehammer knocking down

01:48:20.126 --> 01:48:20.727
those obstacles. To ensure that

01:48:20.794 --> 01:48:23.930
that people are house- with

01:48:23.997 --> 01:48:24.631
with. With some sort of dignity

01:48:24.698 --> 01:48:25.232
and that mental health care

01:48:25.298 --> 01:48:28.501
issues- are beginning to. Their

01:48:28.568 --> 01:48:29.169
trust in a more more much more

01:48:29.236 --> 01:48:32.405
aggressive- manner and that

01:48:32.472 --> 01:48:33.039
substance abuse issues is. At

01:48:33.106 --> 01:48:33.640
the top burner so thank you

01:48:33.707 --> 01:48:36.776
very much I. And I'm gonna go

01:48:36.843 --> 01:48:40.747
to our next panel so I want to.

01:48:40.814 --> 01:48:41.348
It Mister. Mister chair. If I

01:48:41.414 --> 01:48:45.252
may. This could only in the

01:48:45.318 --> 01:48:45.886
interest of the other panelists

01:48:45.952 --> 01:48:49.256
I wanna make sure that they're

01:48:49.322 --> 01:48:49.856
not going to leave us. But all

01:48:49.923 --> 01:48:50.457
deferred it to ms Rivas. It's

01:48:50.523 --> 01:48:51.124
gonna make a brief comment. Of

01:48:51.191 --> 01:48:51.691
you know I'm looking at our

01:48:51.758 --> 01:48:53.293
state investments and thank you

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:53.727
to the chairman. For

01:48:53.793 --> 01:48:57.264
summarizing this but I think.

01:48:57.330 --> 01:48:57.831
At what I see at the state

01:48:57.898 --> 01:48:58.331
level we don't have a

01:48:58.398 --> 01:49:01.735
department. Or a state agency

01:49:01.801 --> 01:49:02.335
that has oversight right there

01:49:02.402 --> 01:49:05.639
or side load or different

01:49:05.705 --> 01:49:06.306
agencies and- I think it's time

01:49:06.373 --> 01:49:06.806
for. The department on

01:49:06.873 --> 01:49:10.143
homelessness at the state level

01:49:10.210 --> 01:49:10.710
right. To coordinate all of

01:49:10.777 --> 01:49:14.114
these. Are programs- and- and

01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:14.648
for there to be oversight

01:49:14.714 --> 01:49:18.218
accountability and strategy

01:49:18.285 --> 01:49:18.718
with working with local

01:49:18.785 --> 01:49:22.255
governments- so. I just wanted

01:49:22.322 --> 01:49:22.889
to get one and this is just to

01:49:22.956 --> 01:49:23.456
remind us all you know the

01:49:23.523 --> 01:49:26.760
state does have- it was a model

01:49:26.826 --> 01:49:27.294
we lifted from Utah. On

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:27.928
introduced a bill several years

01:49:27.994 --> 01:49:30.964
ago the state does not have a-

01:49:31.031 --> 01:49:31.564
homeless coordinating council

01:49:31.631 --> 01:49:32.132
which because if they had

01:49:32.198 --> 01:49:35.135
nothing. So at least now we

01:49:35.201 --> 01:49:35.735
have a coordinating council.

01:49:35.802 --> 01:49:39.072
Because another critical issue

01:49:39.139 --> 01:49:39.639
is holding state department

01:49:39.706 --> 01:49:40.307
heads accountable. For figuring

01:49:40.373 --> 01:49:43.543
out what role they play

01:49:43.610 --> 01:49:47.480
Caltrans director is a perfect

01:49:47.547 --> 01:49:48.114
example in solving this issue.

01:49:48.181 --> 01:49:51.785
In addition to. Looking at you

01:49:51.851 --> 01:49:52.352
know already allocated funds

01:49:52.419 --> 01:49:52.986
that could be directed in this

01:49:53.053 --> 01:49:53.620
area so while we don't have a

01:49:53.687 --> 01:49:56.122
state department or agency. The

01:49:56.189 --> 01:49:56.623
coordinating council was

01:49:56.690 --> 01:50:00.260
funded- by this administration

01:50:00.327 --> 01:50:00.860
in a significant way that had

01:50:00.927 --> 01:50:04.164
not been previously so I think

01:50:04.230 --> 01:50:04.764
that is the first step in a

01:50:04.831 --> 01:50:05.298
signal that the state is.

01:50:05.365 --> 01:50:08.335
Really trying to step up and be

01:50:08.401 --> 01:50:08.768
a partner with local

01:50:08.835 --> 01:50:09.336
government. To be our last

01:50:09.402 --> 01:50:12.439
brief comment. Mister chair. I

01:50:12.505 --> 01:50:13.139
would like to leave with this I

01:50:13.206 --> 01:50:13.707
think the center Hertzberg

01:50:13.773 --> 01:50:16.643
delighted an enormous

01:50:16.710 --> 01:50:17.310
opportunity you mentioned LAUSD.

01:50:17.377 --> 01:50:20.947
LAUSD is the largest

01:50:21.014 --> 01:50:21.614
landholders in the city of Los

01:50:21.681 --> 01:50:25.218
Angeles when you combine that

01:50:25.285 --> 01:50:25.852
with the state- college of. The

01:50:25.919 --> 01:50:29.222
city district. They get

01:50:29.289 --> 01:50:29.889
committee call just thank you.

01:50:29.956 --> 01:50:33.493
Up all of those land use

01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:34.160
decisions are ministered by the

01:50:34.227 --> 01:50:37.364
state there's a state agency

01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:37.864
that that administers a

01:50:37.931 --> 01:50:38.465
planning and land use for all

01:50:38.531 --> 01:50:41.768
of those properties- we've had

01:50:41.835 --> 01:50:45.705
some great successes with LAUSD.

01:50:45.772 --> 01:50:46.339
And between- UST and all you-

01:50:46.406 --> 01:50:46.873
this is the state college

01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:49.909
district alleys yeah thank you.

01:50:49.976 --> 01:50:50.477
There should be no surface

01:50:50.543 --> 01:50:54.314
parking lots left we need to

01:50:54.381 --> 01:50:54.914
build housing and parking on

01:50:54.981 --> 01:50:58.551
all of those sites that's a

01:50:58.618 --> 01:50:59.185
government owned property. Lake

01:50:59.252 --> 01:51:02.455
that's a golden opportunity and

01:51:02.522 --> 01:51:03.056
perhaps that's another bill

01:51:03.123 --> 01:51:03.656
that could be introduced but

01:51:03.723 --> 01:51:06.993
that could be something that

01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:10.764
would really take a bite out of

01:51:10.830 --> 01:51:11.364
exactly what we're trying to

01:51:11.431 --> 01:51:11.931
address and that is taking

01:51:11.998 --> 01:51:14.934
state property. And building on

01:51:15.001 --> 01:51:15.535
it without a loss of parking-

01:51:15.602 --> 01:51:19.072
that can be accomplished and

01:51:19.139 --> 01:51:19.506
there's an enormous

01:51:19.572 --> 01:51:20.073
opportunity- there thank you

01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:20.673
well here's what I get from

01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:23.543
this conversation this is gonna

01:51:23.610 --> 01:51:24.144
be the first one it certainly

01:51:24.210 --> 01:51:27.680
isn't the last one and I feel a

01:51:27.747 --> 01:51:28.248
heck of a lot of energy and

01:51:28.314 --> 01:51:28.815
enthusiasm for continued it

01:51:28.882 --> 01:51:31.851

And I'm gonna call them up in

01:51:41.528 --> 01:51:44.531
the order on if you just line

01:51:44.597 --> 01:51:45.031
up I think we're putting

01:51:45.098 --> 01:51:45.665
another table up there as well

01:51:45.732 --> 01:51:48.368
right now it's doctor Sharon.

01:51:48.435 --> 01:51:48.935

right now it's okay.

01:52:17.497 --> 01:52:21.634
Assemblyman

01:52:25.805 --> 01:52:26.072
. I think you got

01:52:26.139 --> 01:52:30.043
the right

01:52:38.384 --> 01:52:38.651
. Here's the list

01:52:38.718 --> 01:52:46.626
Mitchell fully make

01:52:50.830 --> 01:52:50.897
. It's

01:52:50.964 --> 01:52:59.139
worked. For over the road

01:53:32.539 --> 01:53:32.605
. I'm

01:53:32.672 --> 01:53:33.239
gonna get started on what this

01:53:33.306 --> 01:53:36.709
what what the next pounds about

01:53:36.776 --> 01:53:37.343
what we really wanted to do was

01:53:37.410 --> 01:53:37.877
provide the committee and

01:53:37.944 --> 01:53:41.147
provide ourselves- you included

01:53:41.214 --> 01:53:41.781
a different perspectives and we

01:53:41.848 --> 01:53:42.348
wanted to make sure that we

01:53:42.415 --> 01:53:45.418
tackle they've not only from a

01:53:45.485 --> 01:53:45.985
local government I'm gonna

01:53:46.052 --> 01:53:46.519
continue here from a local

01:53:46.586 --> 01:53:49.556
government despite we wanted to

01:53:49.622 --> 01:53:50.056
see housing advocates a

01:53:50.123 --> 01:53:50.557
philanthropic advocates

01:53:50.623 --> 01:53:53.593
government- in all you folks

01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:54.227
are here combined together and

01:53:54.294 --> 01:53:57.797
obviously the county still on

01:53:57.864 --> 01:53:58.364
it and a law enforcement so

01:53:58.431 --> 01:54:02.101
everybody around the table here

01:54:02.168 --> 01:54:02.702
brings a unique perspective.

01:54:02.769 --> 01:54:06.139
Overly look how to challenge

01:54:06.206 --> 01:54:06.739
this issue of homelessness and

01:54:06.806 --> 01:54:07.273
actually actually have a

01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:07.907
significant dent in it I'm in

01:54:07.974 --> 01:54:10.276
the interest of time I'm gonna

01:54:10.343 --> 01:54:10.810
handed over immediately-

01:54:10.877 --> 01:54:14.480
conductor shared will ask folks

01:54:14.547 --> 01:54:15.048
to stay at their allocated

01:54:15.114 --> 01:54:15.582
amounts I think we told

01:54:15.648 --> 01:54:18.785
everybody try to stay five or

01:54:18.851 --> 01:54:19.385
underneath and but a quick Q.

01:54:19.452 --> 01:54:20.019
and a if you had to leave just

01:54:20.086 --> 01:54:22.989
let me know and because I

01:54:23.056 --> 01:54:23.590
realize is done just a little

01:54:23.656 --> 01:54:31.030
bit oversight Preciado. Thanks

01:54:31.097 --> 01:54:31.598
very much. To be here. And I

01:54:31.664 --> 01:54:32.131
will have to run after my

01:54:32.198 --> 01:54:32.732
comments because I'm supposed

01:54:32.799 --> 01:54:33.333
to be testifying at the board

01:54:33.399 --> 01:54:35.435
of supervisors about. A motion

01:54:35.501 --> 01:54:36.102
to expand the number of mental

01:54:36.169 --> 01:54:36.703
health treatment beds in Los

01:54:36.769 --> 01:54:39.305
Angeles county. After just

01:54:39.372 --> 01:54:39.839
completing a report. With

01:54:39.906 --> 01:54:40.473
numbers around three thousand

01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:43.476
beds and getting authorized in

01:54:43.543 --> 01:54:44.077
my department. To bring five

01:54:44.143 --> 01:54:47.714
hundred more online. Also just

01:54:47.780 --> 01:54:48.348
make a quick remark- related to

01:54:48.414 --> 01:54:51.851
mental health issues and death

01:54:51.918 --> 01:54:52.452
in. The streets and actually

01:54:52.518 --> 01:54:56.155
addictions and. A trauma our

01:54:56.222 --> 01:54:56.789
our our our primary drivers and

01:54:56.856 --> 01:55:00.493
co morbid mental illness and

01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:00.994
addictions are obviously

01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:04.631
critical I'd like to make

01:55:04.697 --> 01:55:05.265
another quick comment regarding

01:55:05.331 --> 01:55:05.832
senator. Senator Mitchell's

01:55:05.898 --> 01:55:08.635
point about sustainability. Too

01:55:08.701 --> 01:55:09.135
many people are becoming

01:55:09.202 --> 01:55:12.939
homeless. We have a massive

01:55:13.006 --> 01:55:16.909
amount of collaboration and

01:55:16.976 --> 01:55:17.543
effort and resource going into

01:55:17.610 --> 01:55:21.080
housing people and we it

01:55:21.147 --> 01:55:21.714
shouldn't have to be that big

01:55:21.781 --> 01:55:22.215
of a number. To sustain

01:55:22.282 --> 01:55:25.351
includes figuring out ways to

01:55:25.418 --> 01:55:25.985
not have to house that many

01:55:26.052 --> 01:55:29.522
people especially when we're

01:55:29.589 --> 01:55:30.089
losing the other thing I'll

01:55:30.156 --> 01:55:30.690
tell you from my perspective

01:55:30.757 --> 01:55:33.593
around mental illness and the

01:55:33.660 --> 01:55:34.260
number of people in the streets

01:55:34.327 --> 01:55:34.794
of mental illness mental

01:55:34.861 --> 01:55:37.630
illness is not one thing.

01:55:37.697 --> 01:55:38.197
There's a range of mental

01:55:38.264 --> 01:55:38.765
illness people live in the

01:55:38.831 --> 01:55:42.035
streets for long periods of

01:55:42.101 --> 01:55:42.602
time we'll developmental on

01:55:42.669 --> 01:55:43.036
this because it's a

01:55:43.102 --> 01:55:46.072
traumatizing experience.

01:55:46.139 --> 01:55:46.739
Individuals with what we would

01:55:46.806 --> 01:55:50.343
call severe persistent mental

01:55:50.410 --> 01:55:50.877
illness that's a smaller

01:55:50.943 --> 01:55:51.444
percentage than the numbers

01:55:51.511 --> 01:55:54.547
that people throw around and I

01:55:54.614 --> 01:55:55.114
think we have to be aware of

01:55:55.181 --> 01:55:59.018
that. I am here on behalf of

01:55:59.085 --> 01:56:02.722
the most vulnerable on it

01:56:02.789 --> 01:56:03.289
recognizing that there are

01:56:03.356 --> 01:56:03.856
multiple populations who are

01:56:03.923 --> 01:56:06.959
homeless and that we have an

01:56:07.026 --> 01:56:07.560
epidemic. And I think one of

01:56:07.627 --> 01:56:08.161
the things that is happening.

01:56:08.227 --> 01:56:11.331
In certain. Populations is

01:56:11.397 --> 01:56:15.735
that. There that the people are

01:56:15.802 --> 01:56:19.372
choosing to not be. House and I

01:56:19.439 --> 01:56:19.972
we have to look at that there

01:56:20.039 --> 01:56:20.473
are a lot of difficult

01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:21.074
questions and topics that I

01:56:21.140 --> 01:56:24.043
believe. Is one of them and one

01:56:24.110 --> 01:56:24.677
of the prop one of the reasons

01:56:24.744 --> 01:56:27.747
that's a problem is because it

01:56:27.814 --> 01:56:28.414
draws resource that we need for

01:56:28.481 --> 01:56:28.915
folks who are the most.

01:56:28.981 --> 01:56:32.318
Vulnerable the other thing I'll

01:56:32.385 --> 01:56:33.019
say is that it's not just about

01:56:33.086 --> 01:56:36.122
new develop and I'm really glad

01:56:36.189 --> 01:56:36.789
to hear that theme here we have

01:56:36.856 --> 01:56:37.423
the leverage the infrastructure

01:56:37.490 --> 01:56:40.460
that exists. We have to

01:56:40.526 --> 01:56:41.094
leverage it through things like

01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:41.728
the boarding care network that

01:56:41.794 --> 01:56:44.430
many of us are trying

01:56:44.497 --> 01:56:45.098
desperately to save. We have to

01:56:45.164 --> 01:56:48.534
look at as filin cells said

01:56:48.601 --> 01:56:49.068
subsidy. For housing that

01:56:49.135 --> 01:56:52.939
exists because we need to get

01:56:53.005 --> 01:56:53.573
it out sooner and we get need

01:56:53.639 --> 01:56:56.976
to get it out. Cheaper as far

01:56:57.043 --> 01:56:57.610
as people living on the street

01:56:57.677 --> 01:56:58.044
and this is a very

01:56:58.111 --> 01:57:01.180
controversial topic people

01:57:01.247 --> 01:57:01.814
living in squalor are actually

01:57:01.881 --> 01:57:05.585
increasing the demand and then

01:57:05.651 --> 01:57:06.152
we need. We're losing when

01:57:06.219 --> 01:57:09.856
people are living in squalor.

01:57:09.922 --> 01:57:13.593
Because people are getting sick.

01:57:13.659 --> 01:57:14.193
Gauge for how bad it is it is

01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:14.794
the death rate which is going

01:57:14.861 --> 01:57:18.164
up. People need a right to

01:57:18.231 --> 01:57:22.135
refuge and refuge. In my

01:57:22.201 --> 01:57:22.735
opinion is something that we

01:57:22.802 --> 01:57:26.205
don't fully understand and

01:57:26.272 --> 01:57:26.773
implement because it doesn't

01:57:26.839 --> 01:57:30.309
have to be. Permits part of

01:57:30.376 --> 01:57:30.977
housing unit it doesn't have to

01:57:31.043 --> 01:57:34.447
be a shelter bed we have to it

01:57:34.514 --> 01:57:35.114
we have a epidemic on our hands

01:57:35.181 --> 01:57:38.785
were collecting more and more.

01:57:38.851 --> 01:57:39.318
Illness and condition for

01:57:39.385 --> 01:57:39.919
people that are suffering in

01:57:39.986 --> 01:57:43.289
squalor we need to leverage our

01:57:43.356 --> 01:57:47.059
properties and do the kinds of

01:57:47.126 --> 01:57:47.660
things that our military does

01:57:47.727 --> 01:57:48.227
when there are. When we're

01:57:48.294 --> 01:57:51.597
going to battle and we're

01:57:51.664 --> 01:57:55.368
taking on major emergencies

01:57:55.435 --> 01:57:55.935
that's a different way and a

01:57:56.002 --> 01:57:56.602
different approach to get it to

01:57:56.669 --> 01:57:59.539
replacing the sidewalks. With

01:57:59.605 --> 01:58:00.106
place where people are not

01:58:00.173 --> 01:58:03.876
traumatized where they have

01:58:03.943 --> 01:58:04.477
more access to services more

01:58:04.544 --> 01:58:05.077
easily and they're not getting

01:58:05.144 --> 01:58:08.314
sick. In terms of mental health

01:58:08.381 --> 01:58:12.151
treatment beds and mental

01:58:12.218 --> 01:58:12.718
health resources in general

01:58:12.785 --> 01:58:16.155
supervisor Ridley Thomas

01:58:16.222 --> 01:58:16.722
mention to be able health

01:58:16.789 --> 01:58:17.256
center we are trying to

01:58:17.323 --> 01:58:17.790
leverage our health care

01:58:17.857 --> 01:58:20.793
campuses to developer sort of

01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:21.327
your villages. Across the

01:58:21.394 --> 01:58:24.464
county this department has

01:58:24.530 --> 01:58:25.064
invested. Over three hundred

01:58:25.131 --> 01:58:28.935
and fifty million dollars since

01:58:29.001 --> 01:58:29.569
I've been here in restorative

01:58:29.635 --> 01:58:30.136
care village asset and that

01:58:30.203 --> 01:58:33.272
includes urging Kerr's as well

01:58:33.339 --> 01:58:33.873
as- acute subacute and open

01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:37.243
transitional units we've also

01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:37.777
put in. A couple hundred

01:58:37.844 --> 01:58:41.247
million dollars into- into

01:58:41.314 --> 01:58:41.848
permits part of housing and

01:58:41.914 --> 01:58:45.418
development as well as services

01:58:45.485 --> 01:58:46.085
which we do. Every year but my

01:58:46.152 --> 01:58:49.789
focus is on the people who are

01:58:49.856 --> 01:58:50.289
the sickest in the most

01:58:50.356 --> 01:58:50.923
vulnerable and I think what we

01:58:50.990 --> 01:58:53.993
have to look at hot spots where

01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:54.627
people are dying we also have

01:58:54.694 --> 01:58:57.864
to be click here. In focusing

01:58:57.930 --> 01:58:58.431
on those who are most most

01:58:58.498 --> 01:59:02.068
vulnerable who are the least

01:59:02.134 --> 01:59:02.635
independent in who will who

01:59:02.702 --> 01:59:03.202
have almost no chance. Of

01:59:03.269 --> 01:59:06.539
getting into permits part of

01:59:06.606 --> 01:59:07.173
housing unless they give we

01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:10.610
give them a serious hand up

01:59:10.676 --> 01:59:11.210
will also say in this one is

01:59:11.277 --> 01:59:15.014
very close to the heart of a

01:59:15.081 --> 01:59:15.481
assemblyman Santiago.

01:59:15.548 --> 01:59:18.851
Involuntary treatment okay we

01:59:18.918 --> 01:59:19.485
have to. Revisit those laws and

01:59:19.552 --> 01:59:23.055
we have to go after them with

01:59:23.122 --> 01:59:23.656
empathy and heart we have to

01:59:23.723 --> 01:59:27.159
put our resources first and

01:59:27.226 --> 01:59:27.793
commit. Anyone who is a rights

01:59:27.860 --> 01:59:31.330
we're going to take away. We

01:59:31.397 --> 01:59:35.535
need to meet them with

01:59:35.601 --> 01:59:36.135
resources up for but we have

01:59:36.202 --> 01:59:39.672
direct ties those are not. Too

01:59:39.739 --> 01:59:44.277
loud. Close those who we cannot

01:59:44.343 --> 01:59:48.281
engage. Despite trying again

01:59:48.347 --> 01:59:48.948
and again we have to be able to

01:59:49.015 --> 01:59:49.549
figure out a way to get them

01:59:49.615 --> 01:59:52.385
into treatment and to get them

01:59:52.451 --> 01:59:52.985
into treatment to help foster

01:59:53.052 --> 01:59:53.586
their recovery in the only way

01:59:53.653 --> 01:59:54.253
you get people to recover is by

01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:54.820
giving them resources and I

01:59:54.887 --> 01:59:56.622
mean housing I mean egg

01:59:56.689 --> 01:59:57.189
dedicated treatment team. I

01:59:57.256 --> 02:00:00.860
mean. The hospital beds when

02:00:00.927 --> 02:00:04.764
they require them and a very

02:00:04.830 --> 02:00:05.398
well informed and resource to.

02:00:05.464 --> 02:00:08.801
A surrogate decision maker I

02:00:08.868 --> 02:00:09.402
don't know how much time that

02:00:09.468 --> 02:00:12.905
was but I'll stop it was good.

02:00:12.972 --> 02:00:17.310
Thank you yeah. Hi I'm sorry

02:00:17.376 --> 02:00:17.910
taught are often with the LA

02:00:17.977 --> 02:00:21.647
county department of health

02:00:21.714 --> 02:00:22.281
services and- with the housing

02:00:22.348 --> 02:00:25.685
for health program within the

02:00:25.751 --> 02:00:26.285
department health services of

02:00:26.352 --> 02:00:29.589
the last few years we built out

02:00:29.655 --> 02:00:30.189
a continuum of services from

02:00:30.256 --> 02:00:30.790
out reach to and from housing

02:00:30.856 --> 02:00:33.960
to permit housing with a focus

02:00:34.026 --> 02:00:34.594
on people who are homeless and

02:00:34.660 --> 02:00:38.064
how the most complex health and

02:00:38.130 --> 02:00:38.664
behavioral health conditions.

02:00:38.731 --> 02:00:42.134
And I just want to sort of- to

02:00:42.201 --> 02:00:42.702
make it very concrete share

02:00:42.768 --> 02:00:46.272
that over the last couple of

02:00:46.339 --> 02:00:46.872
years that I've been with

02:00:46.939 --> 02:00:50.509
housing for health we have-

02:00:50.576 --> 02:00:51.143
gone from a situation where our

02:00:51.210 --> 02:00:54.814
outreach workers could engage

02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:55.448
somebody on the very same day

02:00:55.514 --> 02:00:56.015
and move them into in term

02:00:56.082 --> 02:00:58.985
housing and have it bad for

02:00:59.051 --> 02:00:59.619
them that same day and be able

02:00:59.685 --> 02:01:00.252
to assist them into permanent

02:01:00.319 --> 02:01:03.422
housing within a few weeks or a

02:01:03.489 --> 02:01:07.393
couple of months. Managing a

02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:08.027
portfolio of about twenty four

02:01:08.094 --> 02:01:11.364
hundred intern housing beds now

02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:11.998
today what I can say is that

02:01:12.064 --> 02:01:12.565
like that stay in and from

02:01:12.632 --> 02:01:15.768
housing bad has shifted from.

02:01:15.835 --> 02:01:16.402
Maybe sixty to ninety days for

02:01:16.469 --> 02:01:19.772
we have clients are stained six

02:01:19.839 --> 02:01:20.406
months nine months even twelve

02:01:20.473 --> 02:01:21.007
months because we don't have

02:01:21.073 --> 02:01:24.310
the back door for that we don't

02:01:24.377 --> 02:01:24.910
have the permanent housing for

02:01:24.977 --> 02:01:28.214
them to move into- we- that the

02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:32.218
construction new construction.

02:01:32.284 --> 02:01:32.785
Of affordable and permanent

02:01:32.852 --> 02:01:33.386
supportive housing is a very

02:01:33.452 --> 02:01:36.489
big part the solution fully

02:01:36.555 --> 02:01:37.123
maximizing every federal rental

02:01:37.189 --> 02:01:40.860
subsidy is a very important

02:01:40.926 --> 02:01:41.494
part of the solution. I'm also

02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:42.128
just one elevate something that

02:01:42.194 --> 02:01:44.764
was touched on a couple of

02:01:44.830 --> 02:01:45.331
times here today which is

02:01:45.398 --> 02:01:45.931
investments is sort of like-

02:01:45.998 --> 02:01:49.335
local rental subsidies- we

02:01:49.402 --> 02:01:49.935
operate the flexible housing

02:01:50.002 --> 02:01:53.372
subsidy pool. Which is a way

02:01:53.439 --> 02:01:57.643
for us to very quickly move

02:01:57.710 --> 02:01:58.244
people back into housing. Is

02:01:58.310 --> 02:02:01.547
very flexible it's very nimble

02:02:01.614 --> 02:02:02.114
were able to provide rental

02:02:02.181 --> 02:02:02.715
subsidy support it could be

02:02:02.782 --> 02:02:05.918
short term until some to get

02:02:05.985 --> 02:02:06.552
back on their feet it could be

02:02:06.619 --> 02:02:09.789
longer term if somebody needs

02:02:09.855 --> 02:02:10.356
it could be a bridge to. A

02:02:10.423 --> 02:02:14.093
federal subsidy but what it

02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:14.593
does is it opens up the

02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:15.094
existing housing market.

02:02:15.161 --> 02:02:18.197
Buildings that already exist

02:02:18.264 --> 02:02:18.864
private property owners who are

02:02:18.931 --> 02:02:22.201
willing to take the subsidy.

02:02:22.268 --> 02:02:22.768
With knowing that they will

02:02:22.835 --> 02:02:23.369
have. Us behind it and a half

02:02:23.436 --> 02:02:26.772
according to behind it who they

02:02:26.839 --> 02:02:27.373
can contact twenty four seven

02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:30.976
if there's any issues with and

02:02:31.043 --> 02:02:31.610
it's a- really opens up a lot

02:02:31.677 --> 02:02:34.947
of units we just held serve at

02:02:35.014 --> 02:02:39.051
love eight. The investment of

02:02:39.118 --> 02:02:39.685
the potential for investing and

02:02:39.752 --> 02:02:43.289
stuff like flexible. Housing

02:02:43.355 --> 02:02:47.226
people as quick based

02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:51.564
. I had. A

02:02:51.630 --> 02:02:52.164
path others this bull- thing.

02:02:52.231 --> 02:02:56.001
And then- also I just want to.

02:02:56.068 --> 02:02:56.502
Very briefly talk about

02:02:56.569 --> 02:02:57.136
boarding care- this is a really

02:02:57.203 --> 02:03:00.106
important part of the house to

02:03:00.172 --> 02:03:00.773
continue- especially for people

02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:01.407
who are homeless in of really

02:03:01.474 --> 02:03:04.043
complex healthy behavior health

02:03:04.110 --> 02:03:04.543
conditions- you get the

02:03:04.610 --> 02:03:05.144
housing. You get support with

02:03:05.211 --> 02:03:05.811
your activities of daily living

02:03:05.878 --> 02:03:06.378
you get Rick mind or to take

02:03:06.445 --> 02:03:06.779
medication you get

02:03:06.846 --> 02:03:08.380
transportation assistance is

02:03:08.447 --> 02:03:08.981
just such a key part of the

02:03:09.048 --> 02:03:09.615
housing network for certain sub

02:03:09.682 --> 02:03:10.216
population of people who are

02:03:10.282 --> 02:03:12.651
homeless. The crisis in our

02:03:12.718 --> 02:03:13.285
boarding care right now is huge

02:03:13.352 --> 02:03:16.856
the- it takes you know you know

02:03:16.922 --> 02:03:17.423
the average private pay for

02:03:17.490 --> 02:03:20.960
boarding cares about four

02:03:21.026 --> 02:03:21.560
thousand dollars per month per

02:03:21.627 --> 02:03:25.164
client- most of the clients

02:03:25.231 --> 02:03:25.765
were talking about who. Going

02:03:25.831 --> 02:03:28.901
into here with these complex

02:03:28.968 --> 02:03:29.535
issues are using a site that's

02:03:29.602 --> 02:03:30.169
paying about a thousand dollars

02:03:30.236 --> 02:03:33.472
a month. That's thirty five

02:03:33.539 --> 02:03:37.743
dollars a day that is less than

02:03:37.810 --> 02:03:38.377
what we April from how kilter.

02:03:38.444 --> 02:03:41.580
And we're asking the sites to

02:03:41.647 --> 02:03:42.181
do so much more terms of the

02:03:42.248 --> 02:03:42.782
care and support of people who

02:03:42.848 --> 02:03:49.955
are really complex. Up not to.

02:03:50.022 --> 02:03:50.456
Pull they cannot do the

02:03:50.523 --> 02:03:54.226
deferred maintenance. What do

02:03:54.293 --> 02:03:54.827
you the note people at that

02:03:54.894 --> 02:03:58.430
rate- who really need those

02:03:58.497 --> 02:03:59.031
settings so we need to figure

02:03:59.098 --> 02:03:59.532
out how to shore up our

02:03:59.598 --> 02:04:00.166
boarding care terrace of. Them

02:04:00.232 --> 02:04:02.601
with deferred maintenance and

02:04:02.668 --> 02:04:03.202
how to get enhanced services

02:04:03.269 --> 02:04:03.836
connected to those clients so

02:04:03.903 --> 02:04:06.872
that those boarding cares are

02:04:06.939 --> 02:04:07.439
sustainable and continue to

02:04:07.506 --> 02:04:14.880
operate. Thank you. Mr about.

02:04:14.947 --> 02:04:19.084
On

02:04:23.155 --> 02:04:23.622
. Got it okay of someone four

02:04:23.689 --> 02:04:27.793
minutes and thirty seconds rest

02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:28.427
assured of time to twice okay

02:04:28.494 --> 02:04:29.028
good morning chairman Santiago

02:04:29.094 --> 02:04:29.662
members of the assembly select

02:04:29.728 --> 02:04:30.296
committee. A Los Angeles county

02:04:30.362 --> 02:04:31.864
homelessness. I'm Robbie Harris

02:04:31.931 --> 02:04:32.498
a director with the Los Angeles

02:04:32.565 --> 02:04:35.634
police protective league that

02:04:35.701 --> 02:04:36.202
represents approximately ten

02:04:36.268 --> 02:04:36.836
thousand police officers from

02:04:36.902 --> 02:04:37.469
the rank of lieutenant. Down to

02:04:37.536 --> 02:04:40.105
the recruits in the academy.

02:04:40.172 --> 02:04:40.639
Appreciate appreciate the

02:04:40.706 --> 02:04:41.240
opportunity to speak with you

02:04:41.307 --> 02:04:41.874
today and I'll be focusing my

02:04:41.941 --> 02:04:44.076
comments around St that you've

02:04:44.143 --> 02:04:44.677
probably heard before such as

02:04:44.743 --> 02:04:45.311
Houston we have a problem. And

02:04:45.377 --> 02:04:48.214
how do you eat an elephant. And

02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:48.848
last don't reinvent the wheel.

02:04:48.914 --> 02:04:49.481
In two thousand and eleven the

02:04:49.548 --> 02:04:52.751
city of Houston have the sixth

02:04:52.818 --> 02:04:53.385
largest homeless population in

02:04:53.452 --> 02:04:56.856
America. The point in time

02:04:56.922 --> 02:04:57.356
homes count and survey

02:04:57.423 --> 02:04:57.957
identified eight thousand five

02:04:58.023 --> 02:05:01.026
hundred and thirty eight

02:05:01.093 --> 02:05:01.660
homeless individuals that year.

02:05:01.727 --> 02:05:02.261
Many of these individuals are

02:05:02.328 --> 02:05:04.964
in need of drug abuse mental

02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:05.564
health services and we're not

02:05:05.631 --> 02:05:06.098
receiving the care they

02:05:06.165 --> 02:05:09.301
desperately needed. And police

02:05:09.368 --> 02:05:09.869
officers were dispatched to

02:05:09.935 --> 02:05:13.305
somehow trying to help and

02:05:13.372 --> 02:05:13.806
manage a growing crisis.

02:05:13.873 --> 02:05:14.440
Houston was spending a hundred

02:05:14.506 --> 02:05:17.476
and three million dollars

02:05:17.543 --> 02:05:18.110
annually at the time on fewer

02:05:18.177 --> 02:05:18.544
than fifteen hundred

02:05:18.611 --> 02:05:21.714
chronically homeless

02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:22.281
individuals. The chronically

02:05:22.348 --> 02:05:22.882
homeless individuals comprise

02:05:22.948 --> 02:05:26.151
less 20% of the homeless

02:05:26.218 --> 02:05:30.256
population yet you seventy five

02:05:30.322 --> 02:05:30.723
percent. Of the public

02:05:30.789 --> 02:05:34.393
resources. Veterans also made

02:05:34.460 --> 02:05:34.994
up a large portion of Houston

02:05:35.060 --> 02:05:38.397
most population. Senate leaders

02:05:38.464 --> 02:05:39.031
soon declare Houston we have a

02:05:39.098 --> 02:05:39.665
problem. To address the problem

02:05:39.732 --> 02:05:42.568
the heads of the Houston and

02:05:42.635 --> 02:05:43.035
Harris County housing

02:05:43.102 --> 02:05:43.669
authorities. Directors of city

02:05:43.736 --> 02:05:46.739
and county housing development

02:05:46.805 --> 02:05:47.306
departments the VA service

02:05:47.373 --> 02:05:50.743
providers and community based

02:05:50.809 --> 02:05:51.310
organizations funded to do

02:05:51.377 --> 02:05:51.944
local veteran work sat at one

02:05:52.011 --> 02:05:55.381
table and talked. They created

02:05:55.447 --> 02:05:59.218
housing Houston's heroes and

02:05:59.285 --> 02:05:59.785
their initial goal was to

02:05:59.852 --> 02:06:00.386
permanently house one hundred

02:06:00.452 --> 02:06:03.555
veterans in one Hundred Days.

02:06:03.622 --> 02:06:04.189
They realize that it took over

02:06:04.256 --> 02:06:04.823
one hundred and fifty different

02:06:04.890 --> 02:06:07.960
steps for homeless veteran to

02:06:08.027 --> 02:06:08.460
navigate before getting

02:06:08.527 --> 02:06:12.031
shelter. From securing a photo

02:06:12.097 --> 02:06:12.564
ID a birth certificate to

02:06:12.631 --> 02:06:13.165
filling out almost identical

02:06:13.232 --> 02:06:16.035
paperwork for the housing

02:06:16.101 --> 02:06:16.669
authority in the VA. The local

02:06:16.735 --> 02:06:20.172
governments VA and service

02:06:20.239 --> 02:06:20.839
providers works together to cut

02:06:20.906 --> 02:06:24.209
the one hundred and fifty steps

02:06:24.276 --> 02:06:24.843
to fifty or sixty. And help the

02:06:24.910 --> 02:06:25.444
veterans navigate the entire

02:06:25.511 --> 02:06:28.647
process. In two thousand

02:06:28.714 --> 02:06:29.214
fifteen the city of Houston

02:06:29.281 --> 02:06:32.785
declared a virtual end. To

02:06:32.851 --> 02:06:33.419
veteran homelessness. And this

02:06:33.485 --> 02:06:37.022
past year's point in time

02:06:37.089 --> 02:06:37.556
homeless count and survey

02:06:37.623 --> 02:06:38.157
identified three thousand nine

02:06:38.223 --> 02:06:41.126
hundred and thirty eight

02:06:41.193 --> 02:06:41.794
homeless individuals. Down from

02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:44.964
eight thousand five hundred and

02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:49.201
thirty eight that's a 54%

02:06:49.268 --> 02:06:49.835
decrease in over a homelessness

02:06:49.902 --> 02:06:50.402
since two thousand eleven.

02:06:50.469 --> 02:06:53.706
Houston focused on a ratty

02:06:53.772 --> 02:06:54.306
kidding veteran homelessness

02:06:54.373 --> 02:06:54.940
they also kept working hard at

02:06:55.007 --> 02:06:55.541
reducing homelessness across

02:06:55.607 --> 02:06:57.543
all other population groups but

02:06:57.609 --> 02:06:58.177
they zeroed in on the veterans

02:06:58.243 --> 02:06:58.744
and they succeeded. In Los

02:06:58.811 --> 02:07:02.014
Angeles the numbers are so

02:07:02.081 --> 02:07:02.614
daunting it's like being asked

02:07:02.681 --> 02:07:05.951
how do you eat an elephant. My

02:07:06.018 --> 02:07:06.518
suggestion is to do it like

02:07:06.585 --> 02:07:10.089
Houston did one bite at a time

02:07:10.155 --> 02:07:10.756
and focus on the three thousand

02:07:10.823 --> 02:07:11.390
eight hundred and seventy eight

02:07:11.457 --> 02:07:14.560
homeless veterans the LA. Times

02:07:14.626 --> 02:07:15.127
reported were homeless this

02:07:15.194 --> 02:07:18.597
past veterans day. We all know

02:07:18.664 --> 02:07:19.198
the benefits of housing are

02:07:19.264 --> 02:07:22.668
homeless. You have heard and

02:07:22.735 --> 02:07:23.268
will hear the numbers budget

02:07:23.335 --> 02:07:23.902
implications and obstacles that

02:07:23.969 --> 02:07:26.939
stand in the way. The

02:07:27.006 --> 02:07:27.606
inevitable turf wars blame game

02:07:27.673 --> 02:07:31.043
and finger pointing can consume

02:07:31.110 --> 02:07:31.677
a thousand hearings just like

02:07:31.744 --> 02:07:32.344
this one. But now we know where

02:07:32.411 --> 02:07:35.381
there are successes in

02:07:35.447 --> 02:07:35.948
addressing this humanitarian

02:07:36.015 --> 02:07:39.451
crisis so let's go there. Said

02:07:39.518 --> 02:07:40.052
our egos aside and bring back

02:07:40.119 --> 02:07:43.655
what can work. Salt Lake City

02:07:43.722 --> 02:07:44.289
Phoenix and Houston. Have all

02:07:44.356 --> 02:07:47.593
had measurable successes in

02:07:47.659 --> 02:07:48.060
reducing the homeless

02:07:48.127 --> 02:07:48.627
population. Each of those

02:07:48.694 --> 02:07:52.097
cities has declared a virtual

02:07:52.164 --> 02:07:52.698
end to homeless veterans on

02:07:52.765 --> 02:07:53.265
their streets. They have a

02:07:53.332 --> 02:07:56.068
housing first attitude shelter

02:07:56.135 --> 02:07:56.668
first then the services and

02:07:56.735 --> 02:08:00.139
support. In fact the mayor of

02:08:00.205 --> 02:08:00.773
Phoenix Greg Stanton believes

02:08:00.839 --> 02:08:01.407
that the most important lesson

02:08:01.473 --> 02:08:04.309
from the success of the Phoenix

02:08:04.376 --> 02:08:04.843
model. Is that it can be

02:08:04.910 --> 02:08:05.444
replicated in any community in

02:08:05.511 --> 02:08:08.414
America and I believe them.

02:08:08.480 --> 02:08:09.048
Let's not reinvent the wheel.

02:08:09.114 --> 02:08:12.985
In Houston they created the way

02:08:13.052 --> 02:08:13.585
home a collaborative model to

02:08:13.652 --> 02:08:16.789
prevent and end homelessness.

02:08:16.855 --> 02:08:17.423
Their website is the way home

02:08:17.489 --> 02:08:21.093
Houston dot org. I encourage

02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:21.727
everyone to take time and look

02:08:21.794 --> 02:08:25.164
at what that city is done. And

02:08:25.230 --> 02:08:25.831
there are probably others that

02:08:25.898 --> 02:08:26.432
are moving the needle in the

02:08:26.498 --> 02:08:27.032
right direction and we should

02:08:27.099 --> 02:08:29.701
be open. To doing whatever is

02:08:29.768 --> 02:08:30.302
legal and ethical to rapidly

02:08:30.369 --> 02:08:33.472
adapt what we are currently

02:08:33.539 --> 02:08:34.139
doing to check achieve success.

02:08:34.206 --> 02:08:37.643
I urge this committee to find

02:08:37.709 --> 02:08:38.277
immediate funding and dispatch

02:08:38.343 --> 02:08:38.944
local and state decision makers

02:08:39.011 --> 02:08:41.880
and community based

02:08:41.947 --> 02:08:42.481
organizations to Houston to

02:08:42.548 --> 02:08:45.951
Phoenix to Salt Lake City. And

02:08:46.018 --> 02:08:46.585
see what the cities have done

02:08:46.652 --> 02:08:47.186
what they are doing and let's

02:08:47.252 --> 02:08:50.456
duplicated Los Angeles. We have

02:08:50.522 --> 02:08:54.460
a problem. Thank you. I think

02:08:54.526 --> 02:08:58.797
missile. Mister Harrison

02:08:58.864 --> 02:09:02.701
install next thanks. Hi I

02:09:02.768 --> 02:09:07.005
promise we didn't chat before

02:09:07.072 --> 02:09:07.606
about our remarks and what's

02:09:07.673 --> 02:09:11.110
interesting is that- we have

02:09:11.176 --> 02:09:11.777
lots to has hired the person in

02:09:11.844 --> 02:09:12.344
Houston who worked on that

02:09:12.411 --> 02:09:12.878
program and she has been

02:09:12.945 --> 02:09:15.447
helping us with our strategic

02:09:15.514 --> 02:09:16.081
planning and really looking at

02:09:16.148 --> 02:09:19.485
how the flow chart and how do

02:09:19.551 --> 02:09:20.085
you cut steps because that's

02:09:20.152 --> 02:09:20.686
really the bottom line on I

02:09:20.752 --> 02:09:21.320
wasn't planning on matching up

02:09:21.386 --> 02:09:23.889
but I think that's important

02:09:23.956 --> 02:09:24.523
set to bring up because I think

02:09:24.590 --> 02:09:27.826
we can learn from on the other

02:09:27.893 --> 02:09:28.427
cities and other counties. And

02:09:28.494 --> 02:09:28.927
I just think we have to

02:09:28.994 --> 02:09:31.864
approach this calmly nobody has

02:09:31.930 --> 02:09:32.397
all the answers we've got

02:09:32.464 --> 02:09:33.031
obviously we're here to do more

02:09:33.098 --> 02:09:36.034
and that was the question that

02:09:36.101 --> 02:09:36.702
you asked of us I want to thank

02:09:36.768 --> 02:09:37.336
you all for listening today and

02:09:37.402 --> 02:09:37.870
for the work that you're

02:09:37.936 --> 02:09:40.572
already doing I'm gonna just

02:09:40.639 --> 02:09:41.206
rapid fire some ideas because

02:09:41.273 --> 02:09:44.576
the question was posed to me

02:09:44.643 --> 02:09:45.177
what more can we do I'm and

02:09:45.244 --> 02:09:48.814
what can we do to try and

02:09:48.881 --> 02:09:49.381
sustain more. I will just

02:09:49.448 --> 02:09:52.718
quickly tell you aye approaches

02:09:52.784 --> 02:09:53.318
work as someone who's advised

02:09:53.385 --> 02:09:56.822
very selected officials as a

02:09:56.889 --> 02:09:57.422
deputy mayor a policy a but-

02:09:57.489 --> 02:09:57.990
but it's really my personal

02:09:58.056 --> 02:10:01.326
experience that is giving me

02:10:01.393 --> 02:10:01.994
the most exposure my brother is

02:10:02.060 --> 02:10:02.528
experienced homelessness

02:10:02.594 --> 02:10:05.197
because of six or mental

02:10:05.264 --> 02:10:05.797
illness for the last twenty

02:10:05.864 --> 02:10:09.434
years he's currently in jail I

02:10:09.501 --> 02:10:10.002
twenty hours he's awaiting

02:10:10.068 --> 02:10:13.505
placement in a state hospital

02:10:13.572 --> 02:10:14.106
so you're talking about these

02:10:14.173 --> 02:10:18.076
LPS laws and other laws I'm-

02:10:18.143 --> 02:10:18.677
deeply from your with some of

02:10:18.744 --> 02:10:22.080
the challenges. And they are in

02:10:22.147 --> 02:10:30.355
your hands on to be a. Really

02:10:30.422 --> 02:10:38.530
for the- ache. Amid. Bob let.

02:10:38.597 --> 02:10:43.035
Coming home life then to

02:10:43.101 --> 02:10:43.669
address it once they become

02:10:43.735 --> 02:10:47.206
homeless I'm I'm brought with

02:10:47.272 --> 02:10:47.806
me so- program that Lhasa has

02:10:47.873 --> 02:10:51.009
just launched in collaboration

02:10:51.076 --> 02:10:51.610
with the county and I'd love

02:10:51.677 --> 02:10:52.277
for you guys Ted take a look at

02:10:52.344 --> 02:10:55.547
it get it out to your

02:10:55.614 --> 02:10:56.181
constituents and see if this is

02:10:56.248 --> 02:10:59.785
something we can expand on a

02:10:59.851 --> 02:11:00.419
greater level it's just called

02:11:00.485 --> 02:11:00.986
basic problem solving it's

02:11:01.053 --> 02:11:04.022
another form of diversion but

02:11:04.089 --> 02:11:04.590
it's trying to meet people

02:11:04.656 --> 02:11:07.859
where they are in housing. And

02:11:07.926 --> 02:11:08.493
see what what's it gonna take

02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:09.027
through creative crisis

02:11:09.094 --> 02:11:12.231
management through- through

02:11:12.297 --> 02:11:12.831
conversation what's it gonna

02:11:12.898 --> 02:11:16.235
take to keep you in housing so

02:11:16.301 --> 02:11:16.768
that's something I'm gonna

02:11:16.835 --> 02:11:17.402
leave you with here today on

02:11:17.469 --> 02:11:17.970
the other thing I want to

02:11:18.036 --> 02:11:20.472
highlight which has been

02:11:20.539 --> 02:11:21.139
mentioned by several people but

02:11:21.206 --> 02:11:21.773
I'll take quickly is just the

02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:24.509
boarding care units I

02:11:24.576 --> 02:11:25.077
understand that you guys are

02:11:25.143 --> 02:11:25.744
looking at this AB and flow and

02:11:25.811 --> 02:11:28.947
for the Burke guards to funding

02:11:29.014 --> 02:11:29.514
but I'll just give you the

02:11:29.581 --> 02:11:32.985
brass taxes we lost a thousand

02:11:33.051 --> 02:11:33.518
units. If you multiply a

02:11:33.585 --> 02:11:34.052
thousand times thirty five

02:11:34.119 --> 02:11:37.122
dollars per day. Time three

02:11:37.189 --> 02:11:37.689
hundred sixty five days. You

02:11:37.756 --> 02:11:41.293
have twelve point seven

02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:41.860
million. So there's twelve

02:11:41.927 --> 02:11:42.494
point seven million in savings

02:11:42.561 --> 02:11:43.061
from that budget line item.

02:11:43.128 --> 02:11:45.597
That could be put towards

02:11:45.664 --> 02:11:46.265
saving the rest of those units.

02:11:46.331 --> 02:11:49.801
In LA county. And in other

02:11:49.868 --> 02:11:50.435
counties I'm sure experiencing

02:11:50.502 --> 02:11:53.839
the same issue. So I'm not

02:11:53.905 --> 02:11:54.406
saying you even necessarily

02:11:54.473 --> 02:11:57.843
need to look at and investment

02:11:57.909 --> 02:11:58.443
beyond. The investment that

02:11:58.510 --> 02:11:59.077
you've already budget. I'm just

02:11:59.144 --> 02:12:02.180
saying look at that budgeted

02:12:02.247 --> 02:12:02.814
amount. And start to figure out

02:12:02.881 --> 02:12:06.652
how you can allocate those that

02:12:06.718 --> 02:12:10.355
those dollars. If I'm wrong I

02:12:10.422 --> 02:12:10.856
apologize think about a

02:12:10.922 --> 02:12:14.726
different way. Excellent I I'm

02:12:14.793 --> 02:12:15.294
sure it's more complex but I

02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:18.930
just thought I'd point out the

02:12:18.997 --> 02:12:19.564
fact that we've already lost at

02:12:19.631 --> 02:12:22.968
thousand units. The other thing

02:12:23.035 --> 02:12:23.535
that you guys have all done

02:12:23.602 --> 02:12:24.169
each of you that is remarkable

02:12:24.236 --> 02:12:27.172
as your work around tenants

02:12:27.239 --> 02:12:27.639
rights. And we really

02:12:27.706 --> 02:12:28.173
appreciate that here in LA

02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:31.476
county but I do want to

02:12:31.543 --> 02:12:32.177
highlight on that Ellie city in

02:12:32.244 --> 02:12:35.414
LA county are working on

02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:36.081
greater access to legal advice.

02:12:36.148 --> 02:12:36.581
On through a variety of

02:12:36.648 --> 02:12:39.951
measures how important that is

02:12:40.018 --> 02:12:40.519
before coming here today I

02:12:40.585 --> 02:12:43.755
spoke with one of the public

02:12:43.822 --> 02:12:44.389
interest lawyers that's working

02:12:44.456 --> 02:12:45.023
with las at around prevention

02:12:45.090 --> 02:12:48.193
issues. And she specifically

02:12:48.260 --> 02:12:48.827
mentioned to me about a family

02:12:48.894 --> 02:12:52.030
who went to the Norwalk

02:12:52.097 --> 02:12:52.597
courthouse last week. File

02:12:52.664 --> 02:12:53.131
their paperwork around an

02:12:53.198 --> 02:12:56.368
unlawful eviction. Did not get

02:12:56.435 --> 02:12:57.002
the correct advice to file for

02:12:57.069 --> 02:13:00.772
a fee waiver. Later told your

02:13:00.839 --> 02:13:04.676
owing two hundred euro two

02:13:04.743 --> 02:13:05.310
hundred dollars to file. Tape

02:13:05.377 --> 02:13:05.911
by this addiction. They left

02:13:05.977 --> 02:13:08.980
the courthouse because they

02:13:09.047 --> 02:13:09.548
couldn't pay the two hundred

02:13:09.614 --> 02:13:10.182
dollars. So without access to

02:13:10.248 --> 02:13:13.051
good legal advice. The amazing

02:13:13.118 --> 02:13:13.652
laws that you have passed will

02:13:13.719 --> 02:13:17.122
not have the effect you want. I

02:13:17.189 --> 02:13:17.723
the other thing I wanted to

02:13:17.789 --> 02:13:21.526
just point out is take piggy

02:13:21.593 --> 02:13:21.993
back on some of the

02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:25.530
conversations around. Access to

02:13:25.597 --> 02:13:26.164
immediate housing options. And

02:13:26.231 --> 02:13:29.768
I appreciate senator Hertzberg

02:13:29.835 --> 02:13:30.369
comments around any type of

02:13:30.435 --> 02:13:30.869
government property is

02:13:30.936 --> 02:13:34.072
incredibly useful that cuts

02:13:34.139 --> 02:13:34.740
costs it also can help expedite

02:13:34.806 --> 02:13:38.377
the building of those units. Or

02:13:38.443 --> 02:13:38.977
their their location of safe

02:13:39.044 --> 02:13:42.414
parking I just wanted to make

02:13:42.481 --> 02:13:43.014
sure that is also highlighted

02:13:43.081 --> 02:13:46.284
today. Whether it's cabin

02:13:46.351 --> 02:13:46.885
communities motel conversions

02:13:46.952 --> 02:13:50.555
sprung structures. Safe

02:13:50.622 --> 02:13:51.189
parking. The all of those needs

02:13:51.256 --> 02:13:54.893
we need more of it. On the

02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:55.494
other issue that we've been

02:13:55.560 --> 02:13:58.930
working on it loss that is more

02:13:58.997 --> 02:13:59.498
rapid re housing so it is

02:13:59.564 --> 02:14:03.034
someone who as or family who is

02:14:03.101 --> 02:14:03.635
actually become homeless. But

02:14:03.702 --> 02:14:04.236
again through a smaller level

02:14:04.302 --> 02:14:07.105
of subsidy we can rapidly re

02:14:07.172 --> 02:14:07.739
house them and that's something

02:14:07.806 --> 02:14:08.240
that's proved effective

02:14:08.306 --> 02:14:11.610
throughout. Throughout a lot of

02:14:11.676 --> 02:14:15.547
different neighborhoods and I

02:14:15.614 --> 02:14:16.181
want to encourage that on to be

02:14:16.248 --> 02:14:16.782
expanded. The other thing we

02:14:16.848 --> 02:14:19.751
haven't talked about is housing

02:14:19.818 --> 02:14:20.385
options and rental assistance

02:14:20.452 --> 02:14:20.919
for those who don't meet

02:14:20.986 --> 02:14:21.553
federal criteria based on their

02:14:21.620 --> 02:14:23.922
immigration status. Federal

02:14:23.989 --> 02:14:27.993
programs are really targeting

02:14:28.059 --> 02:14:28.593
folks and I wanna make sure

02:14:28.660 --> 02:14:29.194
we're aware of state funding

02:14:29.261 --> 02:14:32.597
and local funding being used

02:14:32.664 --> 02:14:36.268
effectively to fight back. We

02:14:36.334 --> 02:14:36.935
raise this issue of why were in

02:14:37.002 --> 02:14:37.569
so deep a hole I just want to

02:14:37.636 --> 02:14:40.872
be clear the federal government

02:14:40.939 --> 02:14:44.676
continues to cut and has cut

02:14:44.743 --> 02:14:45.243
housing subsidies over the

02:14:45.310 --> 02:14:45.844
years to the tune of seventy

02:14:45.911 --> 02:14:49.147
percent. So that is an issue to

02:14:49.214 --> 02:14:53.185
keep front and center. We also

02:14:53.251 --> 02:14:53.785
need to look at on incentives

02:14:53.852 --> 02:14:57.155
for smaller cities to do more

02:14:57.222 --> 02:14:57.756
Phil and sell did a great job

02:14:57.823 --> 02:14:58.390
of talking about the ways that

02:14:58.457 --> 02:15:01.626
the county is looking at-

02:15:01.693 --> 02:15:02.160
encouraging that. I know

02:15:02.227 --> 02:15:05.564
several of you are working with

02:15:05.630 --> 02:15:06.164
some of the smaller cities and

02:15:06.231 --> 02:15:06.765
I just want to encourage more

02:15:06.832 --> 02:15:09.935
of that. We do need a higher

02:15:10.001 --> 02:15:10.469
level of care for most

02:15:10.535 --> 02:15:11.102
vulnerable and I appreciate Dr

02:15:11.169 --> 02:15:14.072
Sharon's remarks around the

02:15:14.139 --> 02:15:14.573
mentally ill obviously I

02:15:14.639 --> 02:15:15.207
experience that daily with my

02:15:15.273 --> 02:15:18.443
brother. On and the innovations

02:15:18.510 --> 02:15:18.910
that were working on

02:15:18.977 --> 02:15:22.180
specifically in your district.

02:15:22.247 --> 02:15:22.781
On center draws so where are

02:15:22.848 --> 02:15:26.384
exciting. On but we also need

02:15:26.451 --> 02:15:26.918
access to substance abuse

02:15:26.985 --> 02:15:27.519
treatment. On and that is a

02:15:27.586 --> 02:15:30.789
huge issue on the on at for

02:15:30.856 --> 02:15:34.826
many populations. Are gaps

02:15:34.893 --> 02:15:35.460
analysis coming out of Los at

02:15:35.527 --> 02:15:36.027
the end of this month it's

02:15:36.094 --> 02:15:39.030
going to be talking a little

02:15:39.097 --> 02:15:39.531
bit more. About on. The

02:15:39.598 --> 02:15:40.098
specific details around the

02:15:40.165 --> 02:15:43.368
housing needs for some of our

02:15:43.435 --> 02:15:43.935
most vulnerable. So I just

02:15:44.002 --> 02:15:47.539
wanted to highlight that and

02:15:47.606 --> 02:15:48.106
will make sure to get you a

02:15:48.173 --> 02:15:51.743
copy. Please continue your work

02:15:51.810 --> 02:15:52.210
around eliminate lake

02:15:52.277 --> 02:15:52.811
eliminating regulations that

02:15:52.878 --> 02:15:53.411
get in the way of immediate

02:15:53.478 --> 02:15:56.081
help. So your work on SB eleven

02:15:56.147 --> 02:15:56.681
ninety seven was critical we

02:15:56.748 --> 02:16:00.118
need more of it. On at some of

02:16:00.185 --> 02:16:00.785
the bills that you guys are all

02:16:00.852 --> 02:16:04.055
working on it been. Are great

02:16:04.122 --> 02:16:04.689
and we're excited about but as

02:16:04.756 --> 02:16:08.226
I said federal cuts at 70% we

02:16:08.293 --> 02:16:08.860
need to look at some permanent

02:16:08.927 --> 02:16:12.264
support said support for.

02:16:12.330 --> 02:16:12.797
Affordable housing whether

02:16:12.864 --> 02:16:16.434
that's SB two I know you are

02:16:16.501 --> 02:16:16.935
looking at tax increment

02:16:17.002 --> 02:16:17.536
financing for SB five. Those

02:16:17.602 --> 02:16:20.805
are important on vehicles.

02:16:20.872 --> 02:16:21.373
Finally I had the honor of

02:16:21.439 --> 02:16:24.776
serving on the commission with

02:16:24.843 --> 02:16:25.277
Jacqueline Wagner from

02:16:25.343 --> 02:16:25.810
enterprise foundation. She

02:16:25.877 --> 02:16:29.014
could not be here today.

02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:33.285
Through her leadership and many

02:16:33.351 --> 02:16:33.852
others listed on the report

02:16:33.919 --> 02:16:34.486
that I'm gonna leave with you.

02:16:34.553 --> 02:16:35.053
Los the launch the ad hoc

02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:37.322
committee on black persons

02:16:37.389 --> 02:16:37.923
experiencing homelessness. The

02:16:37.989 --> 02:16:38.456
goal was to listen and to

02:16:38.523 --> 02:16:41.760
create understanding around

02:16:41.826 --> 02:16:42.360
black people are significantly

02:16:42.427 --> 02:16:45.830
over represented here locally

02:16:45.897 --> 02:16:46.331
and nationally by those

02:16:46.398 --> 02:16:49.868
experiencing homelessness. The

02:16:49.935 --> 02:16:50.402
answer is simple and yet

02:16:50.468 --> 02:16:51.002
complex. Structural racism has

02:16:51.069 --> 02:16:53.972
played a significant role. The

02:16:54.039 --> 02:16:58.343
report put forth sixty seven

02:16:58.410 --> 02:16:58.944
recommendations some housing

02:16:59.010 --> 02:17:02.280
assessment tools are missing

02:17:02.347 --> 02:17:02.914
cultural competency other ways

02:17:02.981 --> 02:17:03.515
of getting better access to

02:17:03.582 --> 02:17:06.718
immediate housing. And we're

02:17:06.785 --> 02:17:07.352
beginning to take a hard look

02:17:07.419 --> 02:17:10.789
at that issue and many other

02:17:10.855 --> 02:17:11.389
recommendations but we won't

02:17:11.456 --> 02:17:14.826
win if we don't create systems

02:17:14.893 --> 02:17:15.360
that work for absolutely

02:17:15.427 --> 02:17:18.964
everyone. I want to leave you

02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:19.497
with a copy of that on

02:17:19.564 --> 02:17:20.098
hopefully I've got copies for

02:17:20.165 --> 02:17:27.505
everyone thank you. I think it

02:17:27.572 --> 02:17:35.580
was a. Well thank you I merry

02:17:35.647 --> 02:17:36.214
Leslie in prison a Los Angeles

02:17:36.281 --> 02:17:36.848
business council on an honor to

02:17:36.915 --> 02:17:39.818
be here today thank you

02:17:39.884 --> 02:17:40.452
chairman Santiago for inviting

02:17:40.518 --> 02:17:41.119
us here and also for all of you

02:17:41.186 --> 02:17:44.389
being here today- it's my

02:17:44.456 --> 02:17:45.023
pleasure to share some of the

02:17:45.090 --> 02:17:48.393
key findings of the- L. A. B.

02:17:48.460 --> 02:17:49.027
C. institute LA times and UCLA

02:17:49.094 --> 02:17:52.664
poll you heard quite a bit

02:17:52.731 --> 02:17:53.365
about it today- I think each of

02:17:53.431 --> 02:17:56.768
the committee members have. A

02:17:56.835 --> 02:17:57.402
short version of the graphics

02:17:57.469 --> 02:18:01.172
in their pockets for those of

02:18:01.239 --> 02:18:01.773
you who do not have a short

02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:02.340
version you can go to our

02:18:02.407 --> 02:18:05.243
website at LA this is counsel

02:18:05.310 --> 02:18:09.180
dot org on the pole is- there

02:18:09.247 --> 02:18:09.814
it's available is a transparent

02:18:09.881 --> 02:18:13.652
it's free please spend quality

02:18:13.718 --> 02:18:14.286
time with it but to just give

02:18:14.352 --> 02:18:17.789
you a few high points as polls

02:18:17.856 --> 02:18:18.390
conducted in October it was

02:18:18.456 --> 02:18:21.860
over nine hundred one

02:18:21.926 --> 02:18:22.527
registered voters in LA county-

02:18:22.594 --> 02:18:25.597
the key findings of the poll

02:18:25.664 --> 02:18:26.264
I'm just going to mention a few

02:18:26.331 --> 02:18:26.931
highlights some of which are to

02:18:26.998 --> 02:18:27.599
mention today. This is probably

02:18:27.666 --> 02:18:34.005
first time we've ever seen 95%

02:18:34.072 --> 02:18:34.572
as a number ever ever ever.

02:18:34.639 --> 02:18:38.410
Ever ever okay so. I think and

02:18:38.476 --> 02:18:39.010
the key about that is it's

02:18:39.077 --> 02:18:39.644
everyone it doesn't matter if

02:18:39.711 --> 02:18:42.447
you're conservative it doesn't

02:18:42.514 --> 02:18:43.081
matter if you're moderate does

02:18:43.148 --> 02:18:43.615
not if you're liberal. You

02:18:43.682 --> 02:18:46.551
agree that this is the number

02:18:46.618 --> 02:18:47.152
one issue. Facing LA county

02:18:47.218 --> 02:18:51.122
it's also impacting the mood of

02:18:51.189 --> 02:18:51.823
the county as a whole. Majority

02:18:51.890 --> 02:18:52.323
say they are personally

02:18:52.390 --> 02:18:54.959
affected by homelessness a

02:18:55.026 --> 02:18:55.560
significant number of people

02:18:55.627 --> 02:18:58.997
say. That they have experienced

02:18:59.064 --> 02:18:59.664
it recently many voters feel or

02:18:59.731 --> 02:19:03.268
most of the voters feel

02:19:03.334 --> 02:19:03.902
empathetic towards the homeless

02:19:03.968 --> 02:19:04.602
and most tended thing. Societal

02:19:04.669 --> 02:19:07.772
factors not choices made by

02:19:07.839 --> 02:19:08.406
individuals or the root of the

02:19:08.473 --> 02:19:11.843
problem. Or not blaming the

02:19:11.910 --> 02:19:12.410
homeless. Well a lack of

02:19:12.477 --> 02:19:15.980
affordable housing is seen as a

02:19:16.047 --> 02:19:16.548
major grow- growing problem

02:19:16.614 --> 02:19:20.151
voters are even more likely to

02:19:20.218 --> 02:19:20.752
point to the lack of mental

02:19:20.819 --> 02:19:24.155
health. Services as the met

02:19:24.222 --> 02:19:24.789
major driver of homelessness.

02:19:24.856 --> 02:19:28.460
Voters voters have not lost

02:19:28.526 --> 02:19:29.060
faith the pop on campus all.

02:19:29.127 --> 02:19:32.630
Large majority support of

02:19:32.697 --> 02:19:33.264
writing concrete options both

02:19:33.331 --> 02:19:36.634
systemic and contemporary

02:19:36.701 --> 02:19:37.235
voters want forward thinking

02:19:37.302 --> 02:19:37.836
solutions that will actually

02:19:37.902 --> 02:19:41.172
fix the problem over the long

02:19:41.239 --> 02:19:44.943
term. But at the same time

02:19:45.009 --> 02:19:45.510
there is a high degree of

02:19:45.577 --> 02:19:46.111
urgency around the issue and

02:19:46.177 --> 02:19:49.347
large majorities want to see

02:19:49.414 --> 02:19:49.948
the city take quick. Tangible

02:19:50.014 --> 02:19:53.384
steps to address it. Even if

02:19:53.451 --> 02:19:54.018
the changes require additional

02:19:54.085 --> 02:19:57.655
resources or- or affecting

02:19:57.722 --> 02:19:58.289
their own neighborhood. I would

02:19:58.356 --> 02:20:01.893
ask you to look at the top plan

02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:02.527
results of the poll you also

02:20:02.594 --> 02:20:03.094
have that in your packet for

02:20:03.161 --> 02:20:05.797
the committee members on. We

02:20:05.864 --> 02:20:06.431
also a few questions. These are

02:20:06.498 --> 02:20:10.435
basic questions if more than

02:20:10.502 --> 02:20:11.069
five hundred thousand new units

02:20:11.136 --> 02:20:14.339
are needed to meet the current

02:20:14.405 --> 02:20:14.973
housing demand which proposals

02:20:15.039 --> 02:20:18.409
would you support a range of

02:20:18.476 --> 02:20:19.077
options were supported by more

02:20:19.144 --> 02:20:22.447
than 60% of the voters offering

02:20:22.514 --> 02:20:23.081
incentives to apartment owners.

02:20:23.148 --> 02:20:26.684
To keep rents low promoting

02:20:26.751 --> 02:20:27.252
more affordable housing by

02:20:27.318 --> 02:20:30.822
allowing greater density along

02:20:30.889 --> 02:20:31.322
transportation hubs and

02:20:31.389 --> 02:20:31.856
supporting a rent control

02:20:31.923 --> 02:20:35.126
ordinance to keep pace with

02:20:35.193 --> 02:20:35.760
inflation. We ask voters about

02:20:35.827 --> 02:20:39.397
the legal right to shelter or

02:20:39.464 --> 02:20:43.368
housing 75% of them supported

02:20:43.434 --> 02:20:43.968
requiring the government to

02:20:44.035 --> 02:20:44.602
provide temporary shelter. To

02:20:44.669 --> 02:20:47.772
any homeless person who wishes

02:20:47.839 --> 02:20:48.373
to come indoors we test is

02:20:48.439 --> 02:20:51.709
support for what other cities

02:20:51.776 --> 02:20:52.343
have been doing to address the

02:20:52.410 --> 02:20:52.911
homeless problem this got a

02:20:52.977 --> 02:20:56.147
resounding- response of more

02:20:56.214 --> 02:21:00.118
than 70% Favorite speeding up

02:21:00.185 --> 02:21:00.752
development permit support of

02:21:00.819 --> 02:21:01.319
housing such as apartments

02:21:01.386 --> 02:21:04.255
built out of factory built

02:21:04.322 --> 02:21:04.823
modular. Units teeny houses

02:21:04.889 --> 02:21:08.393
trailers and other structures

02:21:08.459 --> 02:21:08.993
using emergency relief tests

02:21:09.060 --> 02:21:12.530
like those used by the red

02:21:12.597 --> 02:21:13.131
cross and FEMA to bridge to

02:21:13.198 --> 02:21:16.634
more permanent housing. Opening

02:21:16.701 --> 02:21:17.235
up National Guard armory and

02:21:17.302 --> 02:21:21.072
using public property for

02:21:21.139 --> 02:21:21.706
temporary shelters like we do

02:21:21.773 --> 02:21:22.340
for other emergencies providing

02:21:22.407 --> 02:21:25.510
public bathrooms and showers to

02:21:25.577 --> 02:21:29.147
support homeless. Residents as

02:21:29.214 --> 02:21:29.814
they live on the street in the

02:21:29.881 --> 02:21:30.448
neighborhoods using shed light

02:21:30.515 --> 02:21:33.618
cabins community cabins quipped

02:21:33.685 --> 02:21:34.152
with cots electricity and

02:21:34.219 --> 02:21:37.555
plumbing as temporary housing.

02:21:37.622 --> 02:21:38.122
For up to forty people at a

02:21:38.189 --> 02:21:41.759
time until individuals are

02:21:41.826 --> 02:21:42.393
connected to permit housing and

02:21:42.460 --> 02:21:42.994
allowing conversion of single

02:21:43.061 --> 02:21:45.997
family homes to dorm. Style

02:21:46.064 --> 02:21:46.531
developments were multiple

02:21:46.598 --> 02:21:50.134
tenants share common areas.

02:21:50.201 --> 02:21:54.606
Then the LA you see I'm I'm

02:21:54.672 --> 02:21:55.173
doing this in two and a half

02:21:55.240 --> 02:21:55.807
minutes three minutes I suggest

02:21:55.874 --> 02:21:58.710
you take a look a longer look

02:21:58.776 --> 02:21:59.310
at it I'm trying to give you

02:21:59.377 --> 02:21:59.878
the high points we then

02:21:59.944 --> 02:22:02.747
discernment that we at our

02:22:02.814 --> 02:22:03.281
eighteen to and we don't

02:22:03.348 --> 02:22:03.915
housing some of it two weeks

02:22:03.982 --> 02:22:07.185
ago on we create a call to

02:22:07.252 --> 02:22:07.752
action so what do we think

02:22:07.819 --> 02:22:08.386
based on the poll results in

02:22:08.453 --> 02:22:11.422
the years of our research and

02:22:11.489 --> 02:22:12.056
advocacy. We think that it's

02:22:12.123 --> 02:22:15.326
time- to address this issue

02:22:15.393 --> 02:22:15.827
with urgency innovation

02:22:15.894 --> 02:22:19.264
collaboration for those reasons

02:22:19.330 --> 02:22:19.764
we believe the following

02:22:19.831 --> 02:22:20.431
actions should be considered by

02:22:20.498 --> 02:22:23.568
you all- we agree with

02:22:23.635 --> 02:22:24.202
supervisor mark Ridley Thomas

02:22:24.269 --> 02:22:24.836
and they're Steinberg that it

02:22:24.903 --> 02:22:27.872
is time to enact a legal

02:22:27.939 --> 02:22:28.473
imperative to provide a roof

02:22:28.539 --> 02:22:32.010
for every homeless individual

02:22:32.076 --> 02:22:32.610
and family. We think whether

02:22:32.677 --> 02:22:36.214
it's a shelter bridge housing

02:22:36.281 --> 02:22:36.848
navigation centers I support of

02:22:36.915 --> 02:22:40.451
housing every Angelino should

02:22:40.518 --> 02:22:41.052
have the right to a roof over

02:22:41.119 --> 02:22:44.322
their head ultimate goal of

02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:44.856
being placed in permanent

02:22:44.923 --> 02:22:45.456
supportive housing this legal

02:22:45.523 --> 02:22:48.593
mandate must be paired with

02:22:48.660 --> 02:22:49.227
wraparound services to address

02:22:49.294 --> 02:22:49.761
health and substance abuse

02:22:49.827 --> 02:22:52.964
issues. To begin funding this

02:22:53.031 --> 02:22:53.598
imperative we believe the state

02:22:53.665 --> 02:22:57.135
should make an emergency

02:22:57.201 --> 02:22:57.735
appropriation of two billion

02:22:57.802 --> 02:23:01.372
dollars Mitchell for matching

02:23:01.439 --> 02:23:01.973
funds for local jurisdictions

02:23:02.040 --> 02:23:05.410
to fund the development of

02:23:05.476 --> 02:23:05.944
twenty thousand units of

02:23:06.010 --> 02:23:09.280
emergency shelters and bridge

02:23:09.347 --> 02:23:09.881
housing Acosta listen hundred

02:23:09.948 --> 02:23:10.515
thousand prepare. For the long

02:23:10.581 --> 02:23:13.751
term the state should find a

02:23:13.818 --> 02:23:14.419
permanent source of funding for

02:23:14.485 --> 02:23:17.655
homeless housing similar to SB

02:23:17.722 --> 02:23:18.256
two for affordable housing we

02:23:18.323 --> 02:23:21.759
support mayor Steinberg and

02:23:21.826 --> 02:23:22.393
really Thomas is just and that

02:23:22.460 --> 02:23:25.964
reallocation of a large portion

02:23:26.030 --> 02:23:26.531
prop sixty three for mental

02:23:26.597 --> 02:23:30.268
health services if needed. This

02:23:30.335 --> 02:23:30.868
thing should be call related

02:23:30.935 --> 02:23:34.605
with a plan for LA to get our

02:23:34.672 --> 02:23:35.173
new Reno targets which were

02:23:35.239 --> 02:23:38.943
just just happened last month

02:23:39.010 --> 02:23:42.981
which include four hundred and

02:23:43.047 --> 02:23:43.614
seventy six thousand income and

02:23:43.681 --> 02:23:47.151
affordable units for LA county

02:23:47.218 --> 02:23:51.422
under 110020% of a online we

02:23:51.489 --> 02:23:59.664
have never. The number like

02:23:59.731 --> 02:24:03.634
that. That means we. Thirteen

02:24:03.701 --> 02:24:04.268
the estimated- last week in a

02:24:04.335 --> 02:24:04.869
report they release that that

02:24:04.936 --> 02:24:08.006
would be up the hundred thirty

02:24:08.072 --> 02:24:08.573
four billion in subsidy. As

02:24:08.639 --> 02:24:09.240
homelessness is not confined to

02:24:09.307 --> 02:24:12.076
single municipality we would

02:24:12.143 --> 02:24:12.677
encourage the expansion of AB

02:24:12.744 --> 02:24:16.047
eleven ninety seven thank you

02:24:16.114 --> 02:24:16.681
chairman and- at least to the

02:24:16.748 --> 02:24:20.251
borders of LA county if not

02:24:20.318 --> 02:24:20.818
statewide we must look at

02:24:20.885 --> 02:24:24.389
incentivizing low low cost

02:24:24.455 --> 02:24:25.023
construction types. On namely

02:24:25.089 --> 02:24:28.659
modular housing with the

02:24:28.726 --> 02:24:29.227
average cost permits were

02:24:29.293 --> 02:24:32.764
housing being roughly six

02:24:32.830 --> 02:24:33.364
hundred thousand we think the

02:24:33.431 --> 02:24:33.998
cost could be greatly reduced.

02:24:34.065 --> 02:24:37.001
Currently the barriers in

02:24:37.068 --> 02:24:37.568
California or that we don't

02:24:37.635 --> 02:24:38.136
have a lot of it we need to

02:24:38.202 --> 02:24:41.272
look at how we're going to on

02:24:41.339 --> 02:24:45.243
incentivize modular housing and

02:24:45.309 --> 02:24:45.777
state. And for a man's for

02:24:45.843 --> 02:24:46.244
advanced manufacturing

02:24:46.310 --> 02:24:49.781
facilities in here in LA county

02:24:49.847 --> 02:24:53.651
to create more jobs finally we

02:24:53.718 --> 02:24:54.152
think. We should build a

02:24:54.218 --> 02:24:54.752
success along of short term

02:24:54.819 --> 02:24:57.989
solutions like the sprung

02:24:58.056 --> 02:24:58.556
shelters with bunk beds as

02:24:58.623 --> 02:24:59.190
successfully used in San Diego

02:24:59.257 --> 02:25:02.460
San Francisco Pomona Fresno and

02:25:02.527 --> 02:25:06.097
look at Oakland's community

02:25:06.164 --> 02:25:06.597
cabins all dramatically

02:25:06.664 --> 02:25:07.131
increasing the number of

02:25:07.198 --> 02:25:10.601
housing units types of housing

02:25:10.668 --> 02:25:14.405
units smaller units. Available

02:25:14.472 --> 02:25:14.939
for immediate shelter I'm

02:25:15.006 --> 02:25:15.506
certain locality senses the

02:25:15.573 --> 02:25:19.077
city of LA cannot you like

02:25:19.143 --> 02:25:19.677
structures such as committee

02:25:19.744 --> 02:25:23.081
cabins because of the currently

02:25:23.147 --> 02:25:23.714
permitted they're not currently

02:25:23.781 --> 02:25:24.282
for and it the state. Would

02:25:24.348 --> 02:25:27.251
like you to help us we don't

02:25:27.318 --> 02:25:27.885
know if that's a ministry to or

02:25:27.952 --> 02:25:28.386
legislator the state of

02:25:28.453 --> 02:25:31.422
California should develop an

02:25:31.489 --> 02:25:35.326
expedited process to prove low

02:25:35.393 --> 02:25:35.827
cost easily deployable

02:25:35.893 --> 02:25:36.327
structures that can be

02:25:36.394 --> 02:25:39.664
utilized. As emergency in

02:25:39.730 --> 02:25:43.668
around housing

02:25:56.147 --> 02:25:56.414
. And my name is

02:25:56.481 --> 02:25:57.048
Marie Ramsey and I'm here on

02:25:57.115 --> 02:25:57.615
behalf of the central city

02:25:57.682 --> 02:26:00.685
association we are a membership

02:26:00.751 --> 02:26:04.388
organization comprised of about

02:26:04.455 --> 02:26:05.022
four hundred members focused on

02:26:05.089 --> 02:26:05.523
downtown's vibrancy and

02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:06.124
increasing investment in the

02:26:06.190 --> 02:26:08.993
region. And I'll keep my

02:26:09.060 --> 02:26:09.594
remarks brief because I know

02:26:09.660 --> 02:26:12.897
it's been a long hearing- and a

02:26:12.964 --> 02:26:13.498
lot of great stuff has been

02:26:13.564 --> 02:26:14.031
said I agree with all the

02:26:14.098 --> 02:26:17.235
previous speakers. I think just

02:26:17.301 --> 02:26:17.869
real big picture we need a lot

02:26:17.935 --> 02:26:21.205
more housing we haven't been

02:26:21.272 --> 02:26:21.806
building and not. At housing

02:26:21.873 --> 02:26:22.406
production is falling behind

02:26:22.473 --> 02:26:25.576
over the last seventy years

02:26:25.643 --> 02:26:26.210
I'll share some stats from the

02:26:26.277 --> 02:26:29.847
city of LA- and I think to that

02:26:29.914 --> 02:26:30.448
end of for this group- we

02:26:30.515 --> 02:26:33.618
really need to consider

02:26:33.684 --> 02:26:34.252
something like SB fifty that

02:26:34.318 --> 02:26:34.886
would enable the construction

02:26:34.952 --> 02:26:37.955
of housing statewide. I think

02:26:38.022 --> 02:26:38.523
until we get to more units

02:26:38.589 --> 02:26:39.090
everywhere we're going to be

02:26:39.157 --> 02:26:42.460
facing this problem over and

02:26:42.527 --> 02:26:43.094
over again and I also think we

02:26:43.161 --> 02:26:46.230
need to figure out a way to get

02:26:46.297 --> 02:26:46.864
private sector to build more

02:26:46.931 --> 02:26:47.498
units that are affordable by

02:26:47.565 --> 02:26:48.099
right. We are never going to

02:26:48.166 --> 02:26:50.668
have enough subsidies do that

02:26:50.735 --> 02:26:51.302
so we need to figure out a way

02:26:51.369 --> 02:26:54.605
to involve people. And just

02:26:54.672 --> 02:26:55.273
quickly to share some stats- in

02:26:55.339 --> 02:26:58.843
the city of Los Angeles before

02:26:58.910 --> 02:27:02.813
nineteen. Thirty died me bill

02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:07.084
300-100-0400 fifty two units.

02:27:07.151 --> 02:27:07.718
418-402-1950 nine. We but built

02:27:07.785 --> 02:27:11.455
almost. Nothing. In nineteen

02:27:11.522 --> 02:27:12.089
seventy nine without about four

02:27:12.156 --> 02:27:15.426
hundred thousand units. From

02:27:15.493 --> 02:27:15.993
nineteen eighty to nineteen

02:27:16.060 --> 02:27:16.594
ninety nine we built about two

02:27:16.661 --> 02:27:17.228
hundred and forty one thousand

02:27:17.295 --> 02:27:19.830
units. From two thousand till

02:27:19.897 --> 02:27:20.464
now we've built about a hundred

02:27:20.531 --> 02:27:20.998
and thirty seven thousand

02:27:21.065 --> 02:27:24.135
units. So our production has

02:27:24.202 --> 02:27:24.735
sharply fallen. I'm here in

02:27:24.802 --> 02:27:28.139
downtown we've seen a great

02:27:28.206 --> 02:27:28.739
production of units but we're

02:27:28.806 --> 02:27:29.307
still just scratching the

02:27:29.373 --> 02:27:32.243
surface. So as state

02:27:32.310 --> 02:27:32.843
legislators we thank you for

02:27:32.910 --> 02:27:33.444
your attention to this matter

02:27:33.511 --> 02:27:36.581
we appreciate your hard work in

02:27:36.647 --> 02:27:37.148
your commitment- and we ask

02:27:37.215 --> 02:27:40.685
that you embrace something like

02:27:40.751 --> 02:27:41.285
SB fifty this next legislator.

02:27:41.352 --> 02:27:48.993
Thank you. Thank you. I'm their

02:27:49.060 --> 02:27:49.627
best on the executive director

02:27:49.694 --> 02:27:52.930
of the historic core business

02:27:52.997 --> 02:27:53.598
improvement district and I also

02:27:53.664 --> 02:27:57.034
serve on the HHH- oversight

02:27:57.101 --> 02:27:57.668
committee and- I'd echo what

02:27:57.735 --> 02:28:01.572
Marie said- appreciate all the

02:28:01.639 --> 02:28:02.139
comments on housing and the

02:28:02.206 --> 02:28:05.576
fact that we need to build more

02:28:05.643 --> 02:28:06.210
and faster and for less money

02:28:06.277 --> 02:28:06.811
that was one of the things on

02:28:06.877 --> 02:28:09.714
the committee that was very

02:28:09.780 --> 02:28:10.381
disappointing to us is the high

02:28:10.448 --> 02:28:13.851
cost per unit and we really

02:28:13.918 --> 02:28:14.418
wanted to push the idea of

02:28:14.485 --> 02:28:17.922
shared housing and other more

02:28:17.989 --> 02:28:18.556
innovative ideas and just eight

02:28:18.623 --> 02:28:19.156
you know we get get gets away

02:28:19.223 --> 02:28:22.493
from you you don't have much

02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:23.060
time to implement this and

02:28:23.127 --> 02:28:26.230
that. And it takes to develop

02:28:26.297 --> 02:28:26.931
these per is to long- so I have

02:28:26.998 --> 02:28:30.534
a great many ideas about that

02:28:30.601 --> 02:28:31.135
to discuss at another time and

02:28:31.202 --> 02:28:34.639
I was asked mainly focus on-

02:28:34.705 --> 02:28:35.273
mentally ill and addicted which

02:28:35.339 --> 02:28:39.143
as a function of the bed we've

02:28:39.210 --> 02:28:39.777
worked on with individuals on

02:28:39.844 --> 02:28:43.414
the streets implemented I never

02:28:43.481 --> 02:28:44.015
approach I'm sorry excessively

02:28:44.081 --> 02:28:47.618
in some not- SB eighty two with

02:28:47.685 --> 02:28:48.185
of them. I'm not can didn't

02:28:48.252 --> 02:28:51.455
that are sky high and if you

02:28:51.522 --> 02:28:52.056
have a medical emergency that

02:28:52.123 --> 02:28:52.657
it can cripple you financially

02:28:52.723 --> 02:28:55.793
and many financial reasons why

02:28:55.860 --> 02:28:56.394
people end up in homelessness

02:28:56.460 --> 02:28:59.964
but it feels like the stigma of

02:29:00.031 --> 02:29:04.068
mental illness diction and- is

02:29:04.135 --> 02:29:08.039
still preventing us from help

02:29:08.105 --> 02:29:08.673
those who need it the most. I'm

02:29:08.739 --> 02:29:12.610
in the eighteen sixty one the

02:29:12.677 --> 02:29:16.380
hospital's of close down.

02:29:16.447 --> 02:29:16.947
Kennedy in the rated the now

02:29:17.014 --> 02:29:17.548
it's to the mental health. It

02:29:17.615 --> 02:29:18.115
was a- temperature than you

02:29:18.182 --> 02:29:20.885
know they were considered in

02:29:20.951 --> 02:29:21.485
hospitable- the mentally ill

02:29:21.552 --> 02:29:22.086
were then left to. Their own

02:29:22.153 --> 02:29:24.655
communities- and the support

02:29:24.722 --> 02:29:25.256
the local support just never

02:29:25.323 --> 02:29:29.160
came- and by the time Reagan

02:29:29.226 --> 02:29:29.794
took office over four hundred

02:29:29.860 --> 02:29:30.361
thousand people. Had already

02:29:30.428 --> 02:29:33.397
been released into their

02:29:33.464 --> 02:29:33.964
communities from the state

02:29:34.031 --> 02:29:37.468
hospitals- so if you research

02:29:37.535 --> 02:29:41.339
now state after state- it. Has

02:29:41.405 --> 02:29:41.872
two function and deal with

02:29:41.939 --> 02:29:45.576
people who suffer from and also

02:29:45.643 --> 02:29:46.210
knows yeah- which is that they

02:29:46.277 --> 02:29:46.811
don't recognize their illness

02:29:46.877 --> 02:29:49.814
and they don't speak voluntary

02:29:49.880 --> 02:29:50.481
on going care. Op so what that

02:29:50.548 --> 02:29:53.984
means really is ER's and

02:29:54.051 --> 02:29:54.618
prisons are are defective care

02:29:54.685 --> 02:29:58.289
for these folks and- that's

02:29:58.356 --> 02:30:02.326
inappropriate in in humane- and

02:30:02.393 --> 02:30:02.960
now people are being released

02:30:03.027 --> 02:30:03.461
on. The streets- due to

02:30:03.527 --> 02:30:06.430
propositions and other

02:30:06.497 --> 02:30:07.064
legislation without the support

02:30:07.131 --> 02:30:07.665
they were promised. So I'm not

02:30:07.732 --> 02:30:10.901
gonna miss words of what we

02:30:10.968 --> 02:30:14.739
have here now is just a saying

02:30:14.805 --> 02:30:15.272
to a sanctioned system of

02:30:15.339 --> 02:30:19.143
neglect. And we need to first

02:30:19.210 --> 02:30:19.777
recognize that and then vowed

02:30:19.844 --> 02:30:23.347
to change it- we need support

02:30:23.414 --> 02:30:23.914
from our brother and sister

02:30:23.981 --> 02:30:27.585
state this is not just a local

02:30:27.651 --> 02:30:28.152
issue or a California issue

02:30:28.219 --> 02:30:31.355
this is a national issue-

02:30:31.422 --> 02:30:35.593
Medicaid needs to support. Care

02:30:35.659 --> 02:30:36.193
for mental illness for larger

02:30:36.260 --> 02:30:39.897
inpatient facilities- when we

02:30:39.964 --> 02:30:40.464
pass legislation like prop

02:30:40.531 --> 02:30:44.034
sixty three for once we need to

02:30:44.101 --> 02:30:44.535
make a priority people

02:30:44.602 --> 02:30:45.169
suffering from severe mental

02:30:45.236 --> 02:30:48.339
illness- we need to create

02:30:48.406 --> 02:30:48.973
longer term beds and not allow

02:30:49.039 --> 02:30:52.777
people in crisis to be released

02:30:52.843 --> 02:30:53.444
within a matter of hours. In a

02:30:53.511 --> 02:30:56.714
vulnerable fledgling state- we

02:30:56.781 --> 02:31:00.551
need to look at the late term

02:31:00.618 --> 02:31:01.118
in Petra short act which was

02:31:01.185 --> 02:31:01.585
mentioned earlier by-

02:31:01.652 --> 02:31:05.122
supervisor mark Ridley Thomas-

02:31:05.189 --> 02:31:05.756
we need to re evaluate how the

02:31:05.823 --> 02:31:09.293
holds are being utilized are

02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:09.927
they being utilized and do the

02:31:09.994 --> 02:31:13.330
guidelines actually have

02:31:13.397 --> 02:31:13.898
positive results for anyone

02:31:13.964 --> 02:31:17.301
suffering from mental illness.

02:31:17.368 --> 02:31:17.968
But the law was intended to end

02:31:18.035 --> 02:31:18.369
in debt indefinite

02:31:18.436 --> 02:31:21.739
inappropriate holds guarantee

02:31:21.806 --> 02:31:22.206
public safety prevent

02:31:22.273 --> 02:31:25.976
unnecessary expenditures and

02:31:26.043 --> 02:31:26.544
protect persons with mental

02:31:26.610 --> 02:31:27.144
health disorders from criminal

02:31:27.211 --> 02:31:30.181
acts. I think anecdotally in

02:31:30.247 --> 02:31:34.185
statistically we can tell that

02:31:34.251 --> 02:31:34.852
that's not what that's not what

02:31:34.919 --> 02:31:35.386
is happening- people are

02:31:35.453 --> 02:31:38.522
cycling. In and out of the E.

02:31:38.589 --> 02:31:42.393
R. on a regular basis- cycling

02:31:42.460 --> 02:31:42.960
to the prison system we're

02:31:43.027 --> 02:31:43.561
spending resources attempting

02:31:43.627 --> 02:31:46.664
to turn law enforcement

02:31:46.730 --> 02:31:47.298
personnel into mental health

02:31:47.364 --> 02:31:50.768
care providers rather than

02:31:50.835 --> 02:31:51.302
using doctors and nurses

02:31:51.368 --> 02:31:54.772
already trained in the field.

02:31:54.839 --> 02:31:55.372
Rather than providing places

02:31:55.439 --> 02:31:55.973
for people to go that protects

02:31:56.040 --> 02:31:59.276
them- and others- and we have a

02:31:59.343 --> 02:31:59.844
brewing public safety and

02:31:59.910 --> 02:32:03.347
public health crisis so I. I

02:32:03.414 --> 02:32:03.981
just feel like that's a that's

02:32:04.048 --> 02:32:07.451
an excellent place to start and

02:32:07.518 --> 02:32:08.052
it says it's a subsector the

02:32:08.118 --> 02:32:11.555
population that to me is- very

02:32:11.622 --> 02:32:12.223
near and dear to me as I'm been

02:32:12.289 --> 02:32:15.860
downtown working amongst it for

02:32:15.926 --> 02:32:16.460
seventeen years and lived here

02:32:16.527 --> 02:32:24.001
for over eight. Thank you

02:32:28.205 --> 02:32:28.272
. One

02:32:28.339 --> 02:32:32.676
want to try and going last but

02:32:32.743 --> 02:32:36.480
there's a lot of things that

02:32:36.547 --> 02:32:37.014
have already been set I'm

02:32:37.081 --> 02:32:40.784
sorry. That's right. Yeah yeah

02:32:40.851 --> 02:32:41.418
so- I'd obviously there's a lot

02:32:41.485 --> 02:32:45.155
of really good ideas that were

02:32:45.222 --> 02:32:45.823
discussed here today and- much

02:32:45.890 --> 02:32:49.260
like assembly member Santiago

02:32:49.326 --> 02:32:49.894
said this is just the first of

02:32:49.960 --> 02:32:53.430
many discussions- we are family

02:32:53.497 --> 02:32:53.998
at least from our point of

02:32:54.064 --> 02:32:57.601
view. On the ground you know

02:32:57.668 --> 02:32:58.235
and serving the community that

02:32:58.302 --> 02:32:58.869
all of us are fighting for we

02:32:58.936 --> 02:33:01.739
want to make sure that the

02:33:01.805 --> 02:33:02.339
urgency the sense of urgency

02:33:02.406 --> 02:33:05.776
that is being articulated

02:33:05.843 --> 02:33:09.980
today- is kept up and- also

02:33:10.047 --> 02:33:10.614
turned into velocity you know

02:33:10.681 --> 02:33:14.118
we know that resources are here

02:33:14.184 --> 02:33:14.718
we know that- money is here.

02:33:14.785 --> 02:33:15.352
But we also want to make sure

02:33:15.419 --> 02:33:18.289
that the dollar that we get

02:33:18.355 --> 02:33:18.889
turned into a dollar twenty

02:33:18.956 --> 02:33:19.456
five that the minute were

02:33:19.523 --> 02:33:22.493
trying to save turns into two

02:33:22.560 --> 02:33:23.127
minutes because that's really

02:33:23.193 --> 02:33:23.761
kind of what we're living with

02:33:23.827 --> 02:33:26.830
you know- now that in two

02:33:26.897 --> 02:33:27.464
thousand sixteen a lot of these

02:33:27.531 --> 02:33:30.834
measures. Passed one of the

02:33:30.901 --> 02:33:31.435
things that you know I just

02:33:31.502 --> 02:33:32.102
wanna take an opportunity to do

02:33:32.169 --> 02:33:35.239
is to echo some of the things

02:33:35.306 --> 02:33:35.873
that again on the ground that

02:33:35.940 --> 02:33:39.310
were living with that we want

02:33:39.376 --> 02:33:39.944
to make sure look really gets

02:33:40.010 --> 02:33:40.544
at home as priority. You know

02:33:40.611 --> 02:33:43.447
senator Mitchell. Clearly

02:33:43.514 --> 02:33:44.081
outlined that you know things

02:33:44.148 --> 02:33:47.618
AB and flow so a lot of the

02:33:47.685 --> 02:33:48.218
things that I think that our

02:33:48.285 --> 02:33:48.852
community keeps you know. What

02:33:48.919 --> 02:33:52.089
keeps us about it is when this

02:33:52.156 --> 02:33:55.793
runs out. Like let's just say

02:33:55.859 --> 02:33:56.460
for example we get the majority

02:33:56.527 --> 02:33:57.061
of the people off the street

02:33:57.127 --> 02:33:59.997
and housing services provided.

02:34:00.064 --> 02:34:00.598
How does the funding for the

02:34:00.664 --> 02:34:04.602
next five ten fifteen years how

02:34:04.668 --> 02:34:05.269
do we sustain that. You know so

02:34:05.336 --> 02:34:08.472
while we take the chronically

02:34:08.539 --> 02:34:09.106
homeless or the those that are

02:34:09.173 --> 02:34:12.810
on the street and lift them up

02:34:12.876 --> 02:34:13.410
into a house environment. What

02:34:13.477 --> 02:34:13.911
are we doing to stop the

02:34:13.978 --> 02:34:16.814
slippage of economic

02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:17.348
homelessness or youthful

02:34:17.414 --> 02:34:21.085
homelessness or things like

02:34:21.151 --> 02:34:21.719
that so was worth reading those

02:34:21.785 --> 02:34:24.989
two parallel tracks today

02:34:25.055 --> 02:34:25.656
because we do have the sense of

02:34:25.723 --> 02:34:26.290
urgency. Let's not forget that

02:34:26.357 --> 02:34:29.093
we have the obligation

02:34:29.159 --> 02:34:29.660
responsibility and the next

02:34:29.727 --> 02:34:30.260
five ten fifteen years to make

02:34:30.327 --> 02:34:33.364
sure that that's funded and

02:34:33.430 --> 02:34:33.964
supported as well. So I to

02:34:34.031 --> 02:34:34.498
federal level as long as

02:34:34.565 --> 02:34:37.935
there's like awareness that's

02:34:38.002 --> 02:34:38.369
given to that other

02:34:38.435 --> 02:34:38.936
opportunities that we can

02:34:39.003 --> 02:34:41.672
leverage states such as

02:34:41.739 --> 02:34:42.339
Medicaid Medicare how. We know

02:34:42.406 --> 02:34:42.806
that there's a lot of

02:34:42.873 --> 02:34:46.110
individuals on the street that

02:34:46.176 --> 02:34:46.777
are aging in place that they're

02:34:46.844 --> 02:34:47.277
going to have a lot of

02:34:47.344 --> 02:34:50.047
different needs and the next to

02:34:50.114 --> 02:34:50.614
five five to ten years. Are

02:34:50.681 --> 02:34:51.281
there senior living facilities

02:34:51.348 --> 02:34:54.585
that we can convert some of the

02:34:54.652 --> 02:34:55.152
homeless population that we

02:34:55.219 --> 02:34:58.455
have today that opens up units

02:34:58.522 --> 02:34:59.056
that we can continue to move

02:34:59.123 --> 02:34:59.657
people in off the street. But

02:34:59.723 --> 02:35:02.960
making sure that we look at it

02:35:03.027 --> 02:35:03.494
kind of as a system as a

02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:07.064
conduit to continue to solve.

02:35:07.131 --> 02:35:11.035
Some of the law the law more

02:35:11.101 --> 02:35:11.635
local or state you know- focus

02:35:11.702 --> 02:35:15.305
solutions get. Everyone's

02:35:15.372 --> 02:35:15.973
already thank you know assembly

02:35:16.040 --> 02:35:19.677
member Thiago before AB eleven

02:35:19.743 --> 02:35:20.277
ninety spent but developer at

02:35:20.344 --> 02:35:23.647
its get row housing tract. That

02:35:23.714 --> 02:35:24.214
is really going to help us

02:35:24.281 --> 02:35:27.551
perpetuate facilitating hit

02:35:27.618 --> 02:35:28.185
velocity of development. So it

02:35:28.252 --> 02:35:32.089
gets people off measure H.

02:35:32.156 --> 02:35:32.656
helps us provide service.

02:35:32.723 --> 02:35:36.126
Master and then was a lot of

02:35:36.193 --> 02:35:36.660
Xin earlier big act I can

02:35:36.727 --> 02:35:40.197
workforce develop and how do we

02:35:40.264 --> 02:35:40.764
allow people to perpetuate

02:35:40.831 --> 02:35:41.365
itself state. It doesn't mean

02:35:41.432 --> 02:35:44.501
they have like a large sum of

02:35:44.568 --> 02:35:45.069
money to. Do it I feel like

02:35:45.135 --> 02:35:45.636
they're contributing to self

02:35:45.703 --> 02:35:48.639
success and giving back to the

02:35:48.706 --> 02:35:49.273
community. One of the last- key

02:35:49.339 --> 02:35:52.810
points that I think that you

02:35:52.876 --> 02:35:53.310
know a will be at the

02:35:53.377 --> 02:35:56.714
organization wanna make and

02:35:56.780 --> 02:35:57.414
treat said at a very very well

02:35:57.481 --> 02:36:01.285
earlier. Is they can move the

02:36:01.351 --> 02:36:05.089
needle very quickly a lot

02:36:05.155 --> 02:36:05.723
faster than we can so when we.

02:36:05.789 --> 02:36:09.426
Facilitates sport and help the

02:36:09.493 --> 02:36:10.060
community is that ours are on

02:36:10.127 --> 02:36:13.397
the street once their house

02:36:13.464 --> 02:36:13.964
they are faster at finding

02:36:14.031 --> 02:36:14.498
solutions and finding the

02:36:14.565 --> 02:36:18.035
people that still need to be

02:36:18.102 --> 02:36:18.635
housing breaking down those

02:36:18.702 --> 02:36:21.772
barriers and the last pieces of

02:36:21.839 --> 02:36:22.372
the data all of us talk about

02:36:22.439 --> 02:36:25.909
data you know and from our

02:36:25.976 --> 02:36:26.477
organization from. Al all of

02:36:26.543 --> 02:36:30.147
our you know counterparts is.

02:36:30.214 --> 02:36:30.714
Angeles and California are

02:36:30.781 --> 02:36:34.351
leading data providers we can

02:36:34.418 --> 02:36:38.422
be- the solution that sometimes

02:36:38.489 --> 02:36:39.056
we hear about like Houston is

02:36:39.123 --> 02:36:39.690
huge we know that there's a lot

02:36:39.757 --> 02:36:42.793
of air time on that but Los

02:36:42.860 --> 02:36:43.393
Angeles and San Francisco in

02:36:43.460 --> 02:36:43.994
Sacramento we have the data

02:36:44.061 --> 02:36:47.164
we've solve problems. We can do

02:36:47.231 --> 02:36:47.798
influences kinda nationwide as

02:36:47.865 --> 02:36:51.301
well so- with that again thank

02:36:51.368 --> 02:36:51.802
you very much for this

02:36:51.869 --> 02:36:52.402
opportunity and allowing me to

02:36:52.469 --> 02:36:55.372
close this out. Thank you very

02:36:55.439 --> 02:36:59.376
much all panel

02:37:03.547 --> 02:37:03.814
. There's just so

02:37:03.881 --> 02:37:04.381
many good people we need to

02:37:04.448 --> 02:37:07.885
include the mall but- I really

02:37:07.951 --> 02:37:08.519
appreciate that I'm gonna open

02:37:08.585 --> 02:37:09.052
up to. A to the committee

02:37:09.119 --> 02:37:09.653
members of those any questions

02:37:09.720 --> 02:37:12.122
this Hertzberg. This store make

02:37:12.189 --> 02:37:16.059
a statement that so much a

02:37:16.126 --> 02:37:16.627
question. You know recently

02:37:16.693 --> 02:37:17.127
under the leadership of

02:37:17.194 --> 02:37:20.497
assembly member- com all their

02:37:20.564 --> 02:37:24.768
dove. She did a great job in

02:37:24.835 --> 02:37:25.369
bringing us together is in LA

02:37:25.435 --> 02:37:28.806
county delegation. I think it's

02:37:28.872 --> 02:37:29.473
something like forty members of

02:37:29.540 --> 02:37:30.073
the legislature between both

02:37:30.140 --> 02:37:33.010
the assembly and the Senate

02:37:33.076 --> 02:37:36.947
representing LA county. And I

02:37:37.014 --> 02:37:37.548
gotta tell you it's important

02:37:37.614 --> 02:37:38.148
message to go forth to all of

02:37:38.215 --> 02:37:41.618
us. I think the thing that came

02:37:41.685 --> 02:37:42.219
out of that is that we all

02:37:42.286 --> 02:37:45.522
agreed before this but I was

02:37:45.589 --> 02:37:46.190
before this polar wasn't it was

02:37:46.256 --> 02:37:46.757
it was influenced by that or

02:37:46.824 --> 02:37:49.726
not I would suggest it was

02:37:49.793 --> 02:37:50.327
before that. Which we're going

02:37:50.394 --> 02:37:50.961
to make this a priority we're

02:37:51.028 --> 02:37:53.931
going to develop a strategic

02:37:53.997 --> 02:37:54.531
plan and we've already of the

02:37:54.598 --> 02:37:55.165
monks ourselves talked about a

02:37:55.232 --> 02:37:57.801
number of the issues that are

02:37:57.868 --> 02:37:58.468
represented here today. But to

02:37:58.535 --> 02:37:59.102
really be a dynamic force from

02:37:59.169 --> 02:38:02.339
LA county it's hard to pull us

02:38:02.406 --> 02:38:02.973
all together from all different

02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:06.476
corners of the county people in

02:38:06.543 --> 02:38:07.077
one but every the county and

02:38:07.144 --> 02:38:07.711
the other is a county don't we

02:38:07.778 --> 02:38:10.347
know each other well we have a

02:38:10.414 --> 02:38:10.981
good. And this is a priority

02:38:11.048 --> 02:38:14.418
and you're gonna see I think

02:38:14.484 --> 02:38:15.018
and I think this this hearing

02:38:15.085 --> 02:38:18.822
today. Are the German was

02:38:18.889 --> 02:38:19.423
there. Was was is part of that

02:38:19.489 --> 02:38:19.990
effort and so I I'm really

02:38:20.057 --> 02:38:23.160
excited about that I'm excited

02:38:23.227 --> 02:38:23.827
about the interest among all of

02:38:23.894 --> 02:38:24.428
us and the willingness for all

02:38:24.494 --> 02:38:27.130
of us to work together to take

02:38:27.197 --> 02:38:27.664
a strategic approach. For

02:38:27.731 --> 02:38:28.232
deliverables for us Senate

02:38:28.298 --> 02:38:31.235
forty members of the

02:38:31.301 --> 02:38:31.835
legislature I think we have

02:38:31.902 --> 02:38:32.469
some ability particularly with

02:38:32.536 --> 02:38:35.539
the number of us who are on

02:38:35.606 --> 02:38:36.106
their to actually have some

02:38:36.173 --> 02:38:43.580
important immediate impact.

02:38:43.647 --> 02:38:44.214
Please I'm trying to get. That

02:38:44.281 --> 02:38:44.681
same out county caucus

02:38:44.748 --> 02:38:47.885
conveniently the meeting. Over

02:38:47.951 --> 02:38:52.055
here now- we also heard from

02:38:52.122 --> 02:38:52.623
doctor sharing and heard the

02:38:52.689 --> 02:38:53.257
issue about the board and care

02:38:53.323 --> 02:38:53.790
and so is something we're

02:38:53.857 --> 02:38:54.391
definitely gonna pay attention

02:38:54.458 --> 02:38:56.426
to I wish it was it was.

02:38:56.493 --> 02:38:57.060
Mathematically a simple as you

02:38:57.127 --> 02:39:00.564
suggested the bad that are

02:39:00.631 --> 02:39:04.434
going to use and it's just not-

02:39:04.501 --> 02:39:05.035
so forgive me for. Shaking my

02:39:05.102 --> 02:39:08.605
head which distracted you- but

02:39:08.672 --> 02:39:09.172
but we are clear about the

02:39:09.239 --> 02:39:09.706
challenge- and as I said

02:39:09.773 --> 02:39:13.210
earlier you know the notion of

02:39:13.277 --> 02:39:13.844
government and we create these

02:39:13.911 --> 02:39:17.047
funding silos you know the fact

02:39:17.114 --> 02:39:17.648
that eighteen HHX dollars can

02:39:17.714 --> 02:39:21.251
be used to fund board care

02:39:21.318 --> 02:39:21.885
beds. Was perhaps short sighted

02:39:21.952 --> 02:39:25.555
and so yeah. They can you can

02:39:25.622 --> 02:39:26.156
you confirm the services but

02:39:26.223 --> 02:39:33.697
not the bad or the reverse.

02:39:33.764 --> 02:39:37.801
Eighty so if you fund the bed.

02:39:37.868 --> 02:39:38.335
Did not no place like home

02:39:38.402 --> 02:39:42.139
actually. ATK. There are

02:39:42.205 --> 02:39:46.443
several nay taking projects

02:39:46.510 --> 02:39:46.977
that are you know the but

02:39:47.044 --> 02:39:50.580
they're not. And talk about the

02:39:50.647 --> 02:39:51.181
things that they actually are

02:39:51.248 --> 02:39:51.782
everything. Because it funds

02:39:51.848 --> 02:39:54.952
the bad enough to service am I

02:39:55.018 --> 02:39:55.519
saying that right it's funds

02:39:55.585 --> 02:40:02.859
the if funds the service. HHH

02:40:02.926 --> 02:40:07.130
is only half right. Ease of

02:40:07.197 --> 02:40:07.731
use. That term. Right so what

02:40:07.798 --> 02:40:11.368
funds the bed death but not the

02:40:11.435 --> 02:40:12.002
services that need to go along

02:40:12.069 --> 02:40:15.605
in a board and care for

02:40:15.672 --> 02:40:16.173
funding. For supporting that

02:40:16.239 --> 02:40:19.643
person. That's right. Yeah

02:40:19.710 --> 02:40:23.714
right. No place like home. I

02:40:23.780 --> 02:40:27.884
got it I got it so the point is

02:40:27.951 --> 02:40:28.452
valid that we create these

02:40:28.518 --> 02:40:29.052
funding streams that are so

02:40:29.119 --> 02:40:32.422
silence so narrow that we don't

02:40:32.489 --> 02:40:33.023
have the flexibility big to be

02:40:33.090 --> 02:40:36.626
creative so we're going to look

02:40:36.693 --> 02:40:40.430
at- the role we have played in

02:40:40.497 --> 02:40:41.098
under cutting the boarding care

02:40:41.164 --> 02:40:41.698
system in a very meaningful

02:40:41.765 --> 02:40:44.901
way- the doctor here brought

02:40:44.968 --> 02:40:45.502
that to our attention. I times

02:40:45.569 --> 02:40:46.069
is covered in our colleague

02:40:46.136 --> 02:40:49.072
assembly member bloom actually

02:40:49.139 --> 02:40:52.976
had a bill- but but we at the

02:40:53.043 --> 02:40:53.543
caucus are going to put our

02:40:53.610 --> 02:40:57.147
shoulder to the grindstone and

02:40:57.214 --> 02:40:57.814
prioritize the board care issue.

02:40:57.881 --> 02:40:58.382
I think the shared housing

02:40:58.448 --> 02:41:01.184
piece is another example of-

02:41:01.251 --> 02:41:01.818
you know how can we creatively

02:41:01.885 --> 02:41:05.522
come up with ways to X. to

02:41:05.589 --> 02:41:06.189
extend the reach. In impact of

02:41:06.256 --> 02:41:09.893
the dollar. And so- we will

02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:13.897
continue to do that- some of us

02:41:13.964 --> 02:41:14.297
have tour doubles

02:41:14.364 --> 02:41:14.931
municipalities aye I think he's

02:41:14.998 --> 02:41:18.402
gone- I went to Utah that's why

02:41:18.468 --> 02:41:19.002
California is now a- housing

02:41:19.069 --> 02:41:22.506
first date we went to Utah saw

02:41:22.572 --> 02:41:23.140
that came back introduced the

02:41:23.206 --> 02:41:26.376
bill. I went to Utah and that's

02:41:26.443 --> 02:41:26.943
why California now has a-

02:41:27.010 --> 02:41:30.514
homeless coordinating council

02:41:30.580 --> 02:41:31.148
I'm and so we've been to those

02:41:31.214 --> 02:41:34.618
places we look at the models-

02:41:34.684 --> 02:41:35.285
and we all have to acknowledge

02:41:35.352 --> 02:41:35.886
that you know California eight

02:41:35.952 --> 02:41:39.022
Utah or Arizona- we have-

02:41:39.089 --> 02:41:43.293
unique- characteristics- and

02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:47.264
unique challenges and unique

02:41:47.330 --> 02:41:47.831
opportunities. And so we're

02:41:47.898 --> 02:41:48.432
looking at those models and

02:41:48.498 --> 02:41:51.268
bringing to bear what is

02:41:51.334 --> 02:41:51.802
appropriate let's helpful

02:41:51.868 --> 02:41:55.372
that's not new we've done that

02:41:55.439 --> 02:41:56.006
for a number of years. And will

02:41:56.073 --> 02:41:59.843
continue to do so- I think what

02:41:59.910 --> 02:42:04.047
is new. For us what I did see

02:42:04.114 --> 02:42:04.581
in you thought and didn't

02:42:04.648 --> 02:42:05.115
experience. The cal. Our

02:42:05.182 --> 02:42:08.118
policy. What do you top five

02:42:08.185 --> 02:42:08.718
years ago. Is now we are in a

02:42:08.785 --> 02:42:09.286
place where every level of

02:42:09.352 --> 02:42:12.089
government sense federal

02:42:12.155 --> 02:42:12.622
government but death while

02:42:12.689 --> 02:42:13.256
actions matter- are on the same

02:42:13.323 --> 02:42:16.760
page. When the state took the

02:42:16.827 --> 02:42:20.530
vote to eliminate redevelopment.

02:42:20.597 --> 02:42:21.164
This they walked away. And an

02:42:21.231 --> 02:42:21.698
expected municipalities to

02:42:21.765 --> 02:42:29.106
figure it out. The state walked

02:42:29.172 --> 02:42:29.673
away when the state in the

02:42:29.739 --> 02:42:33.009
early two thousands cut cal

02:42:33.076 --> 02:42:37.314
work grant deeply- and so every

02:42:37.380 --> 02:42:37.981
level of government has to bear

02:42:38.048 --> 02:42:38.548
some responsibility but the

02:42:38.615 --> 02:42:41.751
fact that we are now on the

02:42:41.818 --> 02:42:42.385
same page when you can see the

02:42:42.452 --> 02:42:45.722
example an H. HHH and heat

02:42:45.789 --> 02:42:46.289
alphabet soup where we are

02:42:46.356 --> 02:42:49.860
putting our collective

02:42:49.926 --> 02:42:50.527
resources and energy and bright

02:42:50.594 --> 02:42:54.064
thinking and commitment to

02:42:54.131 --> 02:42:58.001
sustained investment over time

02:42:58.068 --> 02:42:58.602
that creates a new space in a

02:42:58.668 --> 02:42:59.169
way in which I think we are

02:42:59.236 --> 02:43:02.472
operating as government

02:43:02.539 --> 02:43:03.106
California and that's the good

02:43:03.173 --> 02:43:06.510
news that I take away- from the

02:43:06.576 --> 02:43:10.647
action that we take in. Thank

02:43:10.714 --> 02:43:11.214
you very much for inviting

02:43:11.281 --> 02:43:11.848
members of the Senate dissipate

02:43:11.915 --> 02:43:12.482
this hearing I was sharing with

02:43:12.549 --> 02:43:14.985
my colleagues. My sitting pro

02:43:15.051 --> 02:43:15.585
TM when she never first these

02:43:15.652 --> 02:43:19.189
to the assembly chair of the

02:43:19.256 --> 02:43:19.756
select committee. And had a

02:43:19.823 --> 02:43:23.226
hearing very similar to today

02:43:23.293 --> 02:43:23.760
S. Skid Row we start the

02:43:23.827 --> 02:43:27.430
morning we walked to Skid Row.

02:43:27.497 --> 02:43:27.964
Then we came in and had a

02:43:28.031 --> 02:43:31.368
hearing. I wish I could but ten

02:43:31.434 --> 02:43:32.002
years the data has improved it

02:43:32.068 --> 02:43:35.505
at that has that much. What

02:43:35.572 --> 02:43:36.106
struck me then is consistent

02:43:36.173 --> 02:43:36.706
today when we look at quite

02:43:36.773 --> 02:43:40.177
frankly the complexion of those

02:43:40.243 --> 02:43:40.810
who need the services and the

02:43:40.877 --> 02:43:44.281
complexion of those to provide

02:43:44.347 --> 02:43:44.848
the services it's still Chiu

02:43:44.915 --> 02:43:48.151
strikingly different I'm not

02:43:48.218 --> 02:43:48.752
sure why that is- vertically

02:43:48.818 --> 02:43:49.419
when you hear a message from to

02:43:49.486 --> 02:43:52.622
reset. Where people talk about

02:43:52.689 --> 02:43:53.156
want to know that they're

02:43:53.223 --> 02:43:56.626
talking to someone who's had a

02:43:56.693 --> 02:43:57.260
sure there lived experiences so

02:43:57.327 --> 02:44:00.730
I think we also have a lot of

02:44:00.797 --> 02:44:01.331
work to do. To make sure that

02:44:01.398 --> 02:44:01.865
we are. Listening hearing

02:44:01.932 --> 02:44:05.101
scheme and being compassionate

02:44:05.168 --> 02:44:05.735
and our policy. And that would

02:44:05.802 --> 02:44:09.105
developing housing and policy

02:44:09.172 --> 02:44:09.739
responses that are meaningful

02:44:09.806 --> 02:44:13.310
and relevant to the people who

02:44:13.376 --> 02:44:13.877
need the services. Thank you

02:44:13.944 --> 02:44:14.444
for the invitation today and

02:44:14.511 --> 02:44:14.844
for all of you for

02:44:14.911 --> 02:44:17.514
participating. Since the first

02:44:17.581 --> 02:44:18.081
of all let me say thank you

02:44:18.148 --> 02:44:21.785
very much- echo what my

02:44:21.851 --> 02:44:22.385
colleagues on the Senate has

02:44:22.452 --> 02:44:25.789
already raised- I would not be

02:44:25.855 --> 02:44:26.356
redundant but I will say I

02:44:26.423 --> 02:44:27.023
think the panel was very robust

02:44:27.090 --> 02:44:29.993
I appreciate- each of you have

02:44:30.060 --> 02:44:30.594
certainly given me a greater

02:44:30.660 --> 02:44:34.264
insight- I've tried to take a

02:44:34.331 --> 02:44:38.268
very copious notes- around

02:44:38.335 --> 02:44:38.902
paper nice I use in my bones I

02:44:38.969 --> 02:44:39.402
wasn't texting anywhere

02:44:39.469 --> 02:44:42.372
disrespecting. But but I've

02:44:42.439 --> 02:44:43.006
certainly believe that I have

02:44:43.073 --> 02:44:46.576
some policy ideals that will-

02:44:46.643 --> 02:44:47.143
one is very timely because

02:44:47.210 --> 02:44:47.744
we're on recess we go back in

02:44:47.811 --> 02:44:51.047
January Chiang were six. And we

02:44:51.114 --> 02:44:51.681
have an opportunity to go back

02:44:51.748 --> 02:44:54.951
and take what you have shared

02:44:55.018 --> 02:44:55.585
and create some public policy

02:44:55.652 --> 02:44:59.022
but I think it would help move

02:44:59.089 --> 02:44:59.589
the needle and also look at

02:44:59.656 --> 02:45:03.293
tangible- measurable- changes

02:45:03.360 --> 02:45:07.330
taking place around

02:45:07.397 --> 02:45:07.831
homelessness here- and-

02:45:07.897 --> 02:45:08.398
California and so I want to

02:45:08.465 --> 02:45:11.835
thank. Everyone and I want to

02:45:11.901 --> 02:45:15.605
apologize for eating now- what

02:45:15.672 --> 02:45:16.139
at opportunity to hear the

02:45:16.206 --> 02:45:20.010
public- I'm hearing. Testimony

02:45:20.076 --> 02:45:20.610
but I'll look at that. And I

02:45:20.677 --> 02:45:24.347
will suggest the chairman if-

02:45:24.414 --> 02:45:24.914
at the staff in other will

02:45:24.981 --> 02:45:28.585
provide. A some notes that you

02:45:28.652 --> 02:45:32.589
may have shared and share those

02:45:32.656 --> 02:45:33.123
knows with the entire our

02:45:33.189 --> 02:45:36.926
offices. Here maybe follow ups

02:45:36.993 --> 02:45:44.934
thank you much. If you're. The

02:45:45.001 --> 02:45:45.502
card is already plotting and

02:45:45.568 --> 02:45:49.339
planning. But but look we want

02:45:49.406 --> 02:45:49.973
to thank everybody who's you're

02:45:50.040 --> 02:45:50.540
not gonna go long winded and

02:45:50.607 --> 02:45:53.410
speech here but but what I do

02:45:53.476 --> 02:45:54.044
want to say what's unique about

02:45:54.110 --> 02:45:54.611
it in this was part of the

02:45:54.678 --> 02:45:55.178
conversations that we've had

02:45:55.245 --> 02:45:55.745
over the years in terms of

02:45:55.812 --> 02:45:57.314
prioritizing- homelessness.

02:45:57.380 --> 02:45:57.881
Homelessness issue- was to

02:45:57.947 --> 02:45:58.515
create select committee for LA

02:45:58.581 --> 02:46:01.818
county that was specific but

02:46:01.885 --> 02:46:02.485
what what was also unique about

02:46:02.552 --> 02:46:03.086
it I think is that the fact

02:46:03.153 --> 02:46:05.855
that. You have most of the

02:46:05.922 --> 02:46:06.423
other a good portion Daly

02:46:06.489 --> 02:46:06.990
members were active on the

02:46:07.057 --> 02:46:10.160
issue here and then- and all

02:46:10.226 --> 02:46:10.827
all I go with my colleagues of

02:46:10.894 --> 02:46:14.331
said we invited the Senate as

02:46:14.397 --> 02:46:14.964
well so we just don't only have

02:46:15.031 --> 02:46:15.565
support on the assembly side

02:46:15.632 --> 02:46:18.368
from a few people but we- also

02:46:18.435 --> 02:46:18.968
have. The support on on the

02:46:19.035 --> 02:46:22.539
side and not your- and people

02:46:22.605 --> 02:46:26.576
who carry weight as well- the

02:46:26.643 --> 02:46:27.243
budget chair on the Senate side

02:46:27.310 --> 02:46:30.880
and the Majority Leader on the

02:46:30.947 --> 02:46:31.448
Senate side- oddity Mister

02:46:31.514 --> 02:46:35.251
draws of who. Covers the ski

02:46:35.318 --> 02:46:39.022
area well we tried to buy the

02:46:39.089 --> 02:46:39.622
way it will have some sort of.

02:46:39.689 --> 02:46:43.493
Tangible gains. Budget just.

02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:44.027
When it in the book. The

02:46:44.094 --> 02:46:44.627
people's together not a plan

02:46:44.694 --> 02:46:47.764
out over the next year. From

02:46:47.831 --> 02:46:48.398
the how big substantive change.

02:46:48.465 --> 02:46:48.998
Or at least make some serious

02:46:49.065 --> 02:46:51.568
Denson and achieving- to house

02:46:51.634 --> 02:46:52.235
people. Now I do wanna take of

02:46:52.302 --> 02:46:52.836
the moment- the go to hope-

02:46:52.902 --> 02:46:53.370
public comments. And we've

02:46:53.436 --> 02:46:55.839
asked the public comments could

02:46:55.905 --> 02:46:56.406
be held to one minute. If

02:46:56.473 --> 02:46:57.040
that's okay no one thank you.

02:46:57.107 --> 02:46:59.909
Again for that if I'm speeding

02:46:59.976 --> 02:47:00.477
through its just because we

02:47:00.543 --> 02:47:01.111
went over by about a half hour

02:47:01.177 --> 02:47:01.778
sub also learned. A little bit

02:47:01.845 --> 02:47:04.547
about that as well so banks. If

02:47:04.614 --> 02:47:05.148
we start with public comments

02:47:05.215 --> 02:47:08.151
were the Mike public comment

02:47:08.218 --> 02:47:08.752
because I could see that it I

02:47:08.818 --> 02:47:12.389
know that we had a represents a

02:47:12.455 --> 02:47:12.989
canister white who was invited

02:47:13.056 --> 02:47:16.826
to participate but- if we could

02:47:16.893 --> 02:47:17.394
have you go first if you if

02:47:17.460 --> 02:47:20.830
you're okay with that. You

02:47:20.897 --> 02:47:21.498
have. A baby. Okay that's fine.

02:47:21.564 --> 02:47:21.998
Let's get that for the

02:47:22.065 --> 02:47:25.068
remainder of the people we're

02:47:25.135 --> 02:47:25.668
gonna cut off at one minute

02:47:25.735 --> 02:47:29.072
during public comments and I

02:47:29.139 --> 02:47:29.639
just feel really fast. Nine

02:47:29.706 --> 02:47:30.273

02:47:37.781 --> 02:47:38.281
steps as well thank you so

02:47:38.348 --> 02:47:41.651
really quickly my name is white

02:47:41.718 --> 02:47:42.252
with the Los Angeles community

02:47:42.318 --> 02:47:45.755
action network based here in

02:47:45.822 --> 02:47:46.389
Skid Row right down the street

02:47:46.456 --> 02:47:46.990
the founder of LA can twenty

02:47:47.056 --> 02:47:50.226
five years ago and so just a

02:47:50.293 --> 02:47:50.860
couple of things really quickly

02:47:50.927 --> 02:47:54.431
losses twenty nineteen dated

02:47:54.497 --> 02:47:55.031
documented that 71% of houses

02:47:55.098 --> 02:47:58.601
people are households as a

02:47:58.668 --> 02:47:59.235
result of housing affordability

02:47:59.302 --> 02:47:59.736
housing availability and

02:47:59.803 --> 02:48:02.739
poverty only twenty nine

02:48:02.806 --> 02:48:03.306
percent. Reported the house

02:48:03.373 --> 02:48:06.709
lives as a result of mental.

02:48:06.776 --> 02:48:07.377
The music diagnoses. Portent at

02:48:07.444 --> 02:48:10.847
will **** issue that we're not

02:48:10.914 --> 02:48:11.414
target in the issue in the

02:48:11.481 --> 02:48:11.948
inverse oftentimes with

02:48:12.015 --> 02:48:15.285
thinking. It's as a result of

02:48:15.351 --> 02:48:15.852
mental illness and substance

02:48:15.919 --> 02:48:19.155
abuse where it's very clearly

02:48:19.222 --> 02:48:19.789
about housing. This points to

02:48:19.856 --> 02:48:20.356
structural and institutional

02:48:20.423 --> 02:48:23.660
racism in a broken system

02:48:23.726 --> 02:48:24.294
safety net of care the points

02:48:24.360 --> 02:48:27.464
organized abandonment with

02:48:27.530 --> 02:48:28.097
roots in de industrialization.

02:48:28.164 --> 02:48:28.731
The drug wars a cretin cling

02:48:28.798 --> 02:48:31.801
climb bill and related

02:48:31.868 --> 02:48:32.435
expansions of prisons targeting

02:48:32.502 --> 02:48:35.872
black and brown. People welfare

02:48:35.939 --> 02:48:36.473
reform and the decimation of

02:48:36.539 --> 02:48:37.106
the safety net as you spoke of

02:48:37.173 --> 02:48:40.343
earlier- honorable I'm Mitchell

02:48:40.410 --> 02:48:44.280
this is not a by product of bad

02:48:44.347 --> 02:48:44.914
decisions by individuals. This

02:48:44.981 --> 02:48:45.482
is a systematic attack on

02:48:45.548 --> 02:48:48.751
surplus workers and communities

02:48:48.818 --> 02:48:49.319
of color that no longer had

02:48:49.385 --> 02:48:52.655
value senator Dorado was

02:48:52.722 --> 02:48:56.860
absolutely correct. When she

02:48:56.926 --> 02:48:57.460
said that we must take into

02:48:57.527 --> 02:48:58.027
account the seven hundred.

02:48:58.094 --> 02:49:00.864
Twenty one thousand families

02:49:00.930 --> 02:49:01.431
each one point five million

02:49:01.498 --> 02:49:05.401
people who are currently. Being

02:49:05.468 --> 02:49:09.272
hopeless you were irate. Out

02:49:09.339 --> 02:49:13.610
of. This thing is. Not a static

02:49:13.676 --> 02:49:14.210
dominant right three things we

02:49:14.277 --> 02:49:14.844
must tackle run play rents per

02:49:14.911 --> 02:49:15.378
building unit cost of six

02:49:15.445 --> 02:49:17.680
hundred thousand plus 45% of

02:49:17.747 --> 02:49:18.214
those costs going to the

02:49:18.281 --> 02:49:18.848
building. 40% going toward soft

02:49:18.915 --> 02:49:21.718
costs and 11% covering the lan

02:49:21.784 --> 02:49:22.285
must not happen city owned

02:49:22.352 --> 02:49:25.855
property both weapon buildings

02:49:25.922 --> 02:49:26.489
must be used to deal with the

02:49:26.556 --> 02:49:27.123
crisis. The city of Los Angeles

02:49:27.190 --> 02:49:30.527
own seven thousand parcels not

02:49:30.593 --> 02:49:31.127
four hundred twenty eight arm

02:49:31.194 --> 02:49:34.497
of both land and structures we

02:49:34.564 --> 02:49:35.064
need to go back and harking

02:49:35.131 --> 02:49:38.635
back to the times of mayor Tom

02:49:38.701 --> 02:49:42.472
Bradley when he opened. City

02:49:42.539 --> 02:49:43.106
hall to house house was people

02:49:43.172 --> 02:49:43.740
we need to make sure we have.

02:49:43.806 --> 02:49:46.943
Government land lastly we must

02:49:47.010 --> 02:49:47.377
stop all instead of

02:49:47.443 --> 02:49:51.114
criminalization of house was

02:49:51.180 --> 02:49:51.714
people instead provide public

02:49:51.781 --> 02:49:52.315
health infrastructure for and

02:49:52.382 --> 02:49:55.285
sheltered. Houses people

02:49:55.351 --> 02:49:59.155
additionally municipalities

02:49:59.222 --> 02:49:59.622
must stop pursuing the

02:49:59.689 --> 02:50:03.459
overturning a federal court

02:50:03.526 --> 02:50:04.093
just. Like Martin forces boys.

02:50:04.160 --> 02:50:07.664
Are in order simply read

02:50:07.730 --> 02:50:08.331
communities of those people. We

02:50:08.398 --> 02:50:11.768
the land need city owned land

02:50:11.834 --> 02:50:12.402
we need to reduce the cost of

02:50:12.468 --> 02:50:16.272
building and we need to get our

02:50:16.339 --> 02:50:20.209
office today. And we're not be

02:50:20.276 --> 02:50:20.810
eight to speak out rate. Thank

02:50:20.877 --> 02:50:28.484
you so much. Mister white. City

02:50:28.551 --> 02:50:32.689
your reference that. Hi so

02:50:32.755 --> 02:50:33.289
that's and that's basically it

02:50:33.356 --> 02:50:37.093
that's not big. Well that's the

02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:41.064
at entire available you land

02:50:41.130 --> 02:50:41.698
and buildings that the city of

02:50:41.764 --> 02:50:42.265
Los Angeles owns today that

02:50:42.332 --> 02:50:42.865
came out of a report that was

02:50:42.932 --> 02:50:43.466
released two months ago from

02:50:43.533 --> 02:50:45.301
Ron CalPERS so it's seven

02:50:45.368 --> 02:50:45.868
thousand parcels of both raw

02:50:45.935 --> 02:50:46.469
land and building I would say

02:50:46.536 --> 02:50:46.970
on the properties with

02:50:47.036 --> 02:50:49.405
buildings on them in Los

02:50:49.472 --> 02:50:50.006
Angeles we have the adaptive

02:50:50.073 --> 02:50:50.673
reuse ordinance we need to put

02:50:50.740 --> 02:50:53.776
the adaptive reuse. Ordinance

02:50:53.843 --> 02:50:54.277
in fact we all know that

02:50:54.344 --> 02:50:57.747
building cost. But for

02:50:57.814 --> 02:50:58.348
buildings that have been long

02:50:58.414 --> 02:50:58.915
abandoned there's no profit

02:50:58.982 --> 02:51:01.985
there so we need to return

02:51:02.051 --> 02:51:02.585
those to people for one dollar

02:51:02.652 --> 02:51:06.322
per month. Yeah right and the

02:51:06.389 --> 02:51:06.889
rest of the comments we're

02:51:06.956 --> 02:51:10.393
going to keep the one minute-

02:51:10.460 --> 02:51:10.994
that was a special. Reason for

02:51:11.060 --> 02:51:11.561
that thank you. We have as a

02:51:11.628 --> 02:51:18.968
meaning. A good afternoon that

02:51:19.035 --> 02:51:22.572
you guys so much for your time

02:51:22.639 --> 02:51:23.139
my name's Alex contrast I'm

02:51:23.206 --> 02:51:26.843
with the housing coalition-

02:51:26.909 --> 02:51:27.410
statewide nonprofit called

02:51:27.477 --> 02:51:28.011
California yes in my backyard

02:51:28.077 --> 02:51:31.080
and one thing that I've

02:51:31.147 --> 02:51:31.748
frequently come across is that

02:51:31.814 --> 02:51:32.415
local cities I live within the

02:51:32.482 --> 02:51:35.551
county but in the city of

02:51:35.618 --> 02:51:36.152
Downey are often resistant to

02:51:36.219 --> 02:51:39.455
these measures and issues and

02:51:39.522 --> 02:51:40.156
solutions that we are trying to

02:51:40.223 --> 02:51:43.626
come up with two day. And one

02:51:43.693 --> 02:51:44.227
way that you guys can make it

02:51:44.293 --> 02:51:44.827
more easier is the advocating

02:51:44.894 --> 02:51:45.495
through state what policy that

02:51:45.561 --> 02:51:48.097
out Ste essentially forces

02:51:48.164 --> 02:51:51.768
cities to take action since

02:51:51.834 --> 02:51:52.368
they're not held accountable

02:51:52.435 --> 02:51:52.902
where the can do that is

02:51:52.969 --> 02:51:56.305
through SB fifty of more homes

02:51:56.372 --> 02:51:56.939
act currently right now we are

02:51:57.006 --> 02:52:00.376
faced housing shortage and most

02:52:00.443 --> 02:52:01.010
people that I work with are on

02:52:01.077 --> 02:52:04.380
the verge of becoming homeless

02:52:04.447 --> 02:52:04.914
because they're having the

02:52:04.981 --> 02:52:05.548
right burdened. Dust people to

02:52:05.615 --> 02:52:06.115
talk to days day people who

02:52:06.182 --> 02:52:06.716
cannot afford to live a were

02:52:06.783 --> 02:52:08.918
they are currently where they

02:52:08.985 --> 02:52:09.552
work- and they're forced into

02:52:09.619 --> 02:52:12.855
longer commutes which hurts our

02:52:12.922 --> 02:52:16.993
environment- so essentially if

02:52:17.060 --> 02:52:21.397
we can build homes more homes

02:52:21.464 --> 02:52:21.964
where. The jobs are at that

02:52:22.031 --> 02:52:25.368
would. Help tax this is. There

02:52:25.435 --> 02:52:29.706
is some time. Course every was

02:52:29.772 --> 02:52:30.273
government my name is Corey

02:52:30.339 --> 02:52:33.609
Patterson I am a current

02:52:33.676 --> 02:52:34.210
resident Skinner housing trust

02:52:34.277 --> 02:52:34.711
graciously. Things that

02:52:34.777 --> 02:52:38.081
reflected today in my mind are

02:52:38.147 --> 02:52:38.715
the complexion of this is issue

02:52:38.781 --> 02:52:42.218
a shocking. Urgent urgent

02:52:42.285 --> 02:52:46.489
urgent. Money is power but I

02:52:46.556 --> 02:52:50.226
will add action is honor.

02:52:50.293 --> 02:52:54.397
Adaptive assistance is needed

02:52:54.464 --> 02:52:54.964
as least spoke about I would

02:52:55.031 --> 02:52:58.901
love to graduate into a section

02:52:58.968 --> 02:52:59.569
eight housing with that company.

02:52:59.635 --> 02:53:03.039
I am in. A great assisted

02:53:03.106 --> 02:53:07.143
living program I'm not an

02:53:07.210 --> 02:53:07.777
addict I have an assisted dog

02:53:07.844 --> 02:53:11.380

02:53:15.318 --> 02:53:15.885
everybody in this room and this

02:53:15.952 --> 02:53:19.489
time. Thank you very much. Any

02:53:19.555 --> 02:53:20.123
additional comments yes please

02:53:20.189 --> 02:53:24.060
yeah. In all these things all

02:53:24.127 --> 02:53:27.730
the

02:53:31.934 --> 02:53:32.335
. My name is Colleen Katie

02:53:32.401 --> 02:53:33.002
and I've been previously been a

02:53:33.069 --> 02:53:36.539
resident here at the mine cart

02:53:36.606 --> 02:53:37.140
fifteen years ago- and I've

02:53:37.206 --> 02:53:40.710
been on my own for those

02:53:40.777 --> 02:53:41.344
fifteen years and right now I'm

02:53:41.410 --> 02:53:44.747
dealing with my bill is being.

02:53:44.814 --> 02:53:49.051
Sold and the guy is already

02:53:49.118 --> 02:53:49.619
knocking on doors trying to

02:53:49.685 --> 02:53:53.089
give a get us to get cash for

02:53:53.156 --> 02:53:53.689
keys and we have other issues

02:53:53.756 --> 02:53:56.893
but my big big issue for you

02:53:56.959 --> 02:53:57.527
guys because you're state level

02:53:57.593 --> 02:53:58.094
and the city doesn't have

02:53:58.161 --> 02:54:01.230
anything to do with it. How are

02:54:01.297 --> 02:54:01.864
you guys going to or what can

02:54:01.931 --> 02:54:05.434
you do about the- Ellis act

02:54:05.501 --> 02:54:09.405
because it's been used an abuse

02:54:09.472 --> 02:54:09.972
in ways that it wasn't right

02:54:10.039 --> 02:54:13.643
there virtually but intended to.

02:54:13.709 --> 02:54:18.047
Thank you next. Hi some my

02:54:18.114 --> 02:54:22.018
background with homelessness is

02:54:22.084 --> 02:54:22.652
that my parents were homeless-

02:54:22.718 --> 02:54:23.286
when I was two weeks old and it

02:54:23.352 --> 02:54:26.422
was a family of four children

02:54:26.489 --> 02:54:27.056
and so all throughout my life

02:54:27.123 --> 02:54:30.793
AB try to understand how did

02:54:30.860 --> 02:54:31.427
they get homeless because they

02:54:31.494 --> 02:54:34.497
were brilliant people and so I

02:54:34.564 --> 02:54:35.131
noticed that it can happen to

02:54:35.198 --> 02:54:38.901
anyone and I is could possibly

02:54:38.968 --> 02:54:39.468
happen to me very soon- the

02:54:39.535 --> 02:54:40.036
thing that I currently live

02:54:40.102 --> 02:54:43.206
that is- housing trust building

02:54:43.272 --> 02:54:47.009
but I was in there- experiment

02:54:47.076 --> 02:54:47.543
that they started in two

02:54:47.610 --> 02:54:48.110
thousand twelve with a house

02:54:48.177 --> 02:54:51.614
artist. The newspaper actually

02:54:51.681 --> 02:54:52.215
me about that experience and

02:54:52.281 --> 02:54:52.782
you know it could rate and

02:54:52.849 --> 02:54:55.818
we'll see what happens seven

02:54:55.885 --> 02:54:56.452
years later I'm still there but

02:54:56.519 --> 02:55:00.022
now they are- they just raised

02:55:00.089 --> 02:55:03.926
our rents and we believe

02:55:03.993 --> 02:55:04.527
there's about eight units in

02:55:04.594 --> 02:55:08.264
that building that has not been

02:55:08.331 --> 02:55:12.068
house for years now. On top of

02:55:58.047 --> 02:55:58.581
someone to say thank you so

02:55:58.648 --> 02:55:59.148
much for all the work that

02:55:59.215 --> 02:56:02.184
you're doing and having this

02:56:02.251 --> 02:56:02.818
meeting- couple things I want

02:56:02.885 --> 02:56:06.422
to draw attention to. One is at

02:56:06.489 --> 02:56:07.056
the federal level is great to

02:56:07.123 --> 02:56:10.693
hear some conversation

02:56:10.760 --> 02:56:11.327
suggesting things that they can

02:56:11.394 --> 02:56:11.928
do. I wanted to point out the

02:56:11.994 --> 02:56:14.931
people's action how Aaron T. at

02:56:14.997 --> 02:56:15.531
something that as you all-

02:56:15.598 --> 02:56:18.834
talked your colleagues above

02:56:18.901 --> 02:56:19.468
you and in the federal level a

02:56:19.535 --> 02:56:19.969
something encourage our

02:56:20.036 --> 02:56:23.239
representatives and senators to

02:56:23.306 --> 02:56:23.873
be. Looking into in sporting-

02:56:23.940 --> 02:56:27.143
because I do believe that at

02:56:27.209 --> 02:56:27.777
the federal level we have a lot

02:56:27.843 --> 02:56:31.414
to cheap to support the work

02:56:31.480 --> 02:56:32.014
that you're doing. A second I

02:56:32.081 --> 02:56:32.648
just want to bring up the- over

02:56:32.715 --> 02:56:33.182
the next decade we have.

02:56:33.249 --> 02:56:35.885
Challenges on climate change in

02:56:35.952 --> 02:56:36.552
addressing not. And this crisis

02:56:36.619 --> 02:56:39.822
and we've got a potential

02:56:39.889 --> 02:56:40.456
Olympics coming to Los Angeles.

02:56:40.523 --> 02:56:41.090
And I just want to make sure

02:56:41.157 --> 02:56:44.226
that. That our leaders are

02:56:44.293 --> 02:56:48.197
looking at- the potential costs

02:56:48.264 --> 02:56:48.831
and impacts of the Olympics on

02:56:48.898 --> 02:56:52.468
our- poor up. On the poor and

02:56:52.535 --> 02:56:56.706
just to be. So many just please

02:56:56.772 --> 02:56:57.306
pay attention to the a large

02:56:57.373 --> 02:57:00.743
cost per sister short period of

02:57:00.810 --> 02:57:01.377
time the benefits just a small

02:57:01.444 --> 02:57:04.880
group of people and can have a

02:57:04.947 --> 02:57:05.514
massive impact on everyone else

02:57:05.581 --> 02:57:06.115

02:57:06.182 --> 02:57:09.018
