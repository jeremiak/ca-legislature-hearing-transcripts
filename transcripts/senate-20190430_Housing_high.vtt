00:06:28.387 --> 00:06:29.822
TYPICALLY DON'T SELL UNLESS THEY

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.157

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:38.331

I THINK THIS INCENTIVE WILL

00:06:45.204 --> 00:06:46.472
KNOWLEDGE SOME SELLERS WHO WON

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:49.008

00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:06.526
THE PROCESS AS WELL.

00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:08.528
AND IT WOULD PROVIDE AN IMPETUS

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:09.128
FOR THOSE SELLERS WHO ARE NOT

00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:10.429

IT WAS A LITTLE FRUSTRATED SO

00:12:02.188 --> 00:12:03.389
WHEN I READ TO THE BILL LAST

00:12:03.456 --> 00:12:05.224
YEAR ELEVEN SIXTEEN WHICH WOULD

GIVE A FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.185
TAKING CARE OF THE BIG PICTURE

00:12:33.252 --> 00:12:35.187

MY PURPOSE HERE AND THIS IS A

00:12:55.674 --> 00:12:57.076

INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS A

00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:16.428
PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE THE FORMULA

00:18:16.495 --> 00:18:18.163
USED IN THAT BILL DID NOT REALLY

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.132

INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS AND WE

00:18:36.715 --> 00:18:39.051
BELIEVE WE FOUND THAT IN SB

00:18:39.117 --> 00:18:39.818
THREE TO SIX IT RECOGNIZES THE

00:18:39.885 --> 00:18:41.487
FACT THAT EVERY THREE YEARS

THAT THERE ARE NO HEALTH OR

00:19:14.653 --> 00:19:16.288
SAFETY ORDERS WE BELIEVE THAT

00:19:16.355 --> 00:19:17.789
THIS MINIMIZES THE COSTS FOR

00:19:17.856 --> 00:19:18.957
ASSOCIATIONS.

00:19:19.024 --> 00:19:20.259
BUT AT THE SAME TIME AND WORKING

00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:21.293
WITH AN EXISTING STRUCTURE

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.129
ALLOWS THEM TO ADEQUATELY PLAN.

00:19:24.196 --> 00:19:28.033
AND FINANCE OF THOSE REPAIRS AS

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:28.834
NEEDED.

00:19:28.901 --> 00:19:29.735
AFTER THE SECOND PART OF THE

00:19:29.801 --> 00:19:31.670

00:19:35.707 --> 00:19:37.676
DEFECT.

00:19:37.743 --> 00:19:39.778
IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT TWIN CC

00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:41.146
AND OURS ARE DEVELOPED AND

00:19:41.213 --> 00:19:42.848
WRITTEN BY THE DEVELOPERS THAT

00:19:42.915 --> 00:19:44.850
MOST OF THOSE DOCUMENTS WRITTEN

00:19:44.917 --> 00:19:46.852
THESE DAYS REQUIRE CERTAIN

00:19:46.919 --> 00:19:49.721
ELEMENTS INCLUDING A VOTE OF ALL

00:19:49.788 --> 00:19:50.389
THE MEMBERS.

00:19:50.455 --> 00:19:53.559
PRIOR TO ALLOWING ASSOCIATION TO

CONSTRUCTION DEFECT ACTION HOW

00:19:57.229 --> 00:19:58.297
WE BELIEVE THIS IS EXTREMELY

00:19:58.363 --> 00:19:59.865
UNFAIR AND THAT THE MEMBERS OF

00:19:59.932 --> 00:20:01.500
THE ASSOCIATION HAD NO SAY IN

00:20:01.567 --> 00:20:02.935
THE WRITING OF THOSE DOCUMENTS.

00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:04.002
AND IT CREATES AN OF STOCK

00:20:04.069 --> 00:20:06.538
OBSTRUCTION TO A STATUTORY RIGHT

00:20:06.605 --> 00:20:07.506
THAT THEY CURRENTLY HAVE.

COMMON WALLS BETWEEN UNITS.

00:25:25.323 --> 00:25:26.825

00:25:49.848 --> 00:25:51.483
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR THOSE

00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:53.318
CLAIMS SO WE DON'T WE WANT TO BE

00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:54.286
CLEAR.

00:25:54.352 --> 00:25:57.522
THIS ISN'T ABOUT.

00:25:57.589 --> 00:25:59.324
THAT PART OF THE BILL.

00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:00.725
THE PART OF THE BILL THAT WE ARE

00:26:00.792 --> 00:26:02.060
CONCERNED WITH IS THAT THE BILL

00:26:02.127 --> 00:26:03.461
ALSO PROHIBITS.

00:26:03.528 --> 00:26:06.865
THE HOMEOWNERS FROM VOTING ON ON

00:26:06.932 --> 00:26:08.300
THOSE.

00:26:08.366 --> 00:26:10.068
ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE BOARD TO

00:26:10.135 --> 00:26:11.469
FILE LAWSUITS.

00:26:11.536 --> 00:26:13.438
AND FOR BEING INFORMED OF THE

00:26:13.505 --> 00:26:15.073
CONSEQUENCES OF THAT.

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.374
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND FIRST OF

00:26:16.441 --> 00:26:18.243
ALL WHY THOSE PROVISIONS ARE PUT

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:19.644
INTO THE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS IN

00:26:19.711 --> 00:26:21.680
THE FIRST PLACE.

00:26:21.746 --> 00:26:23.682
WE RECEIVED AT THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:26:23.748 --> 00:26:25.050
REAL ESTATE ALSO RECEIVE

00:26:25.116 --> 00:26:27.319
COMPLAINTS FROM EXISTING

00:26:27.385 --> 00:26:28.653
HOMEOWNERS WHO AFTER THE

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.888
LITIGATION WAS FILED WERE

00:26:29.955 --> 00:26:31.556
SURPRISED TO FIND.

00:26:31.623 --> 00:26:32.991
THAT THEIR DUES ARE ASSESSMENTS

00:26:33.058 --> 00:26:34.459
WERE INCREASED THAT THEY HAD TO

00:26:34.526 --> 00:26:36.328
MAKE THEIR UNITS AVAILABLE FOR

00:26:36.394 --> 00:26:38.930
INSPECTION SOMETIMES DESTRUCTIVE

00:26:38.997 --> 00:26:40.398
TESTING OF THOSE UNITS.

00:26:40.465 --> 00:26:42.534
THAT THE OR CALL THE THERE IS

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.602
WITNESSES ARE TO PARTICIPATE IN

00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:46.004
DEPOSITIONS.

00:26:46.071 --> 00:26:48.139
WITH THEIR ABILITY TO SELL OR

00:26:48.206 --> 00:26:50.809
REFINANCE THEIR HOMES AFTER THE

00:26:50.875 --> 00:26:53.111
LITIGATION WAS FILED -- IS

00:26:53.178 --> 00:26:54.346
IMPAIRED AND THAT THEY HAD

00:26:54.412 --> 00:26:56.581
DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS TO FUTURE

00:26:56.648 --> 00:26:57.716
BUYERS.

00:26:57.782 --> 00:26:59.417
AND THAT'S WHY THE D. R. E.

00:26:59.484 --> 00:27:01.586
WHICH IS THE CONSUMER PROTECTOR

00:27:01.653 --> 00:27:02.787
AND ALL OF THIS WITH THAT

00:27:02.854 --> 00:27:05.323
APPROVES OUR GOVERNING DOCUMENTS.

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:07.325
HAS APPROVED THOSE DOCUMENTS

00:27:07.392 --> 00:27:09.794
WITH THOSE PROVISIONS IN THEM.

00:27:09.861 --> 00:27:11.129
THE WAY THE BILL AS CURRENTLY

00:27:11.196 --> 00:27:13.298
WRITTEN IT WOULD EXCLUDE NOT

00:27:13.365 --> 00:27:14.799
JUST THE RIGHT TO VOTE.

00:27:14.866 --> 00:27:16.067
BUT ALSO THE RIGHT TO BE

00:27:16.134 --> 00:27:18.603
INFORMED OF THOSE CONSEQUENCES.

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:20.305
THE REFERENCES THAT ARE MADE TO

00:27:20.372 --> 00:27:22.941
CIVIL CODE SECTION SIXTY ONE

00:27:23.008 --> 00:27:24.709
FIFTY DON'T ADDRESS THAT.

00:27:24.776 --> 00:27:27.879
THE MEETING THAT'S HELD AND AND

00:27:27.946 --> 00:27:29.180
THE DISCUSSION THAT HAPPENS

00:27:29.247 --> 00:27:32.250
SOLELY BETWEEN THE BOARD AND ITS

00:27:32.317 --> 00:27:33.251
COUNCIL.

00:27:33.318 --> 00:27:36.688
IS DESIGNED TO EXPRESS THE NEED

00:27:36.755 --> 00:27:39.057
FOR THE LITIGATION THE PROBLEMS.

00:27:39.124 --> 00:27:40.325
AND IT'S ALL.

00:27:40.392 --> 00:27:42.360
DESIGNED IN A WAY THAT STEERS

00:27:42.427 --> 00:27:43.628
THE BOARD.

00:27:43.695 --> 00:27:45.497
AND IF THERE ARE MEMBERS THAT

00:27:45.563 --> 00:27:48.433
ARE ABLE TO BE THERE -- IS TEARS

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.801
THEM TOWARDS FILING LITIGATION.

00:27:49.868 --> 00:27:51.903
THERE'S THIS IS A PROCESS THAT

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:53.972
DOES NOT NEED TO HAPPEN BEFORE A

00:27:54.039 --> 00:27:56.508
LITIGATION IS FILED IT CAN

00:27:56.574 --> 00:27:57.475
HAPPEN AFTER THAT.

00:27:57.542 --> 00:27:59.611
AND IN IN THOSE REGARDS IT'S

00:27:59.677 --> 00:28:00.979
REALLY NOT AN EFFECTIVE

00:28:01.046 --> 00:28:02.714
SUBSTITUTE FOR SOMEBODY TO BE

00:28:02.781 --> 00:28:04.315
ABLE TO INFLUENCE.

00:28:04.382 --> 00:28:05.583
THE DECISION OF WHETHER OR NOT

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:06.651
TO FILE.

00:28:06.718 --> 00:28:08.353
A LAWSUIT.

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.089
I'M IT'S CLEAR TO US AT LEAST

00:28:11.156 --> 00:28:14.259
THAT THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT.

00:28:14.325 --> 00:28:14.859
THE ATTORNEY REPRESENTING THE

00:28:14.926 --> 00:28:16.795
BOARD CAN'T MAKE MONEY OFF OF

00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:17.962
REPAIRS.

00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:19.330
THEY CAN ONLY MAKE MONEY IF

00:28:19.397 --> 00:28:20.999
LITIGATION IS FILED.

00:28:21.066 --> 00:28:23.001
EXISTING LAW SB EIGHT HUNDRED

00:28:23.068 --> 00:28:24.135
HAS A PRE LITIGATION PROCESS IN

00:28:24.202 --> 00:28:25.737
IT.

00:28:25.804 --> 00:28:27.405
IT BEGINS WITH THE BOARD SENDING

00:28:27.472 --> 00:28:29.140
A NOTICE TO THE BUILDER.

00:28:29.207 --> 00:28:32.243
AND IT HAS INSPECTIONS IT HAS A

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:35.513
REPAIR PROCESS AND HAS MEDIATION

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:36.848
AND EVEN AT THAT POINT.

00:28:36.915 --> 00:28:38.817
IF THE BOARD ISN'T SATISFIED

00:28:38.883 --> 00:28:40.385
WITH THE REPAIRS.

00:28:40.452 --> 00:28:42.020
THEY CAN GO TO COURT FILE A

00:28:42.087 --> 00:28:43.455
LAWSUIT AGAINST THE BUILDER.

00:28:43.521 --> 00:28:45.256
THAT'S A PROCESS THAT TAKES SIX

00:28:45.323 --> 00:28:47.492
MONTHS TO A YEAR.

00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:48.793
IN THE BRANCHES CASE THE ONE

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:49.828
THAT WAS CITED.

00:28:49.894 --> 00:28:51.429
THAT PROCESS ACTUALLY TOOK

00:28:51.496 --> 00:28:53.198
THIRTEEN MONTHS.

00:28:53.264 --> 00:28:55.066
SO THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME DURING

00:28:55.133 --> 00:28:58.369
THAT TIME PERIOD. FOR MEMBERS

00:28:58.436 --> 00:28:59.571
HOMEOWNERS WITHIN THE

00:28:59.637 --> 00:29:02.207
ASSOCIATION TO BE INFORMED OF

00:29:02.273 --> 00:29:03.675
THE CONSEQUENCES OF LITIGATION

00:29:03.741 --> 00:29:05.009
AND EVEN TO VOTE.

00:29:05.076 --> 00:29:07.078
I WOULD SAY THAT.

00:29:07.145 --> 00:29:09.447
IF YOU EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T WANT

00:29:09.514 --> 00:29:10.548
THEM TO VOTE.

00:29:10.615 --> 00:29:13.318
THEY SHOULD STILL BE IN FORT.

00:29:13.384 --> 00:29:15.553
THE COURTS HAVE REALLY ADDRESS

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:16.888
THIS IN A NUMBER OF CASES AND

00:29:16.955 --> 00:29:20.325
ALWAYS UP HELD THE PUBLIC POLICY.

00:29:20.391 --> 00:29:22.093
OF ALLOWING HOMEOWNERS TO BE

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.462
INFORMED AND TO VOTE BEFORE

00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:25.697
LITIGATION.

00:29:25.763 --> 00:29:26.998
I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO MAKE A

00:29:27.065 --> 00:29:29.033
DISTINCTION HERE.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.003
WITH IT IT'S FAIR TO SAY.

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:33.605
THAT PUTTING UP.

00:29:33.671 --> 00:29:35.874
SOME PROCESS SOME PRECONDITION

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.143
BEFORE FILING A CLAIM INITIATING

00:29:38.209 --> 00:29:39.310
THE SB EIGHT HUNDRED PROCESS.

00:29:39.377 --> 00:29:41.312
IS UNFAIR.

00:29:41.379 --> 00:29:43.615
BUT THERE'S ENOUGH TIME BETWEEN

00:29:43.681 --> 00:29:45.383
THE TIME OF FILING A CLAIM AS I

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:46.017
MENTIONED.

00:29:46.084 --> 00:29:47.485
AND A YEAR LATER WHEN YOU FILE A

00:29:47.552 --> 00:29:49.220
LAWSUIT.

00:29:49.287 --> 00:29:50.421
THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME DURING

00:29:50.488 --> 00:29:52.223
THAT PERIOD TO HAVE THIS

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:53.424
CONVERSATION.

00:29:53.491 --> 00:29:54.726
THAT DOESN'T BECOME AN

00:29:54.792 --> 00:29:57.795
IMPAIRMENT. TO FILING.

00:29:57.862 --> 00:29:59.764
A LAWSUIT THE COURTS HAVE SAID

00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:01.332
THAT THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE

00:30:01.399 --> 00:30:02.901
DAVIS STIRLING EXACT AIM TO

00:30:02.967 --> 00:30:04.569
BALANCE THE NEED TO OPERATE

00:30:04.636 --> 00:30:06.437
EFFICIENCY EFFICIENTLY WITH THE

00:30:06.504 --> 00:30:07.739
RIGHTS OF THE MEMBERS TO BE

00:30:07.805 --> 00:30:08.873
INFORMED AND PARTICIPATE IN

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.009
DECISIONS THAT WOULD IMPACT THE

00:30:11.075 --> 00:30:13.211
ASSOCIATION FOR YEARS.

00:30:13.278 --> 00:30:14.512
IF NOT DECADES TO COME.

00:30:14.579 --> 00:30:16.047
WE CANNOT IGNORE SUCH A

00:30:16.114 --> 00:30:17.048
PROVISION IN THE GOVERNING

00:30:17.115 --> 00:30:18.283
DOCUMENTS.

00:30:18.349 --> 00:30:19.417
BECAUSE IT IS INCONVENIENT FOR

00:30:19.484 --> 00:30:20.518
THE ASSOCIATION IN A PARTICULAR

00:30:20.585 --> 00:30:22.153
CASE.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.688
THE ASSOCIATION HAD THE

00:30:23.755 --> 00:30:25.623
GOVERNING DOCUMENTS IT WAS ON

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:27.292
NOTICE OF THEIR CONTENTS PUBLIC

00:30:27.358 --> 00:30:28.927
POLICY REQUIRES US TO FOLLOW THE

00:30:28.993 --> 00:30:31.029
PLAIN LANGUAGE.

00:30:31.095 --> 00:30:32.130
THE VOTE REQUIREMENT IMPLEMENTS

00:30:32.197 --> 00:30:32.964
THE PROTECTIONS OF THE

00:30:33.031 --> 00:30:34.499
INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS ECONOMIC

00:30:34.566 --> 00:30:35.900
INTERESTS IN THE VALUE OF NOT

00:30:35.967 --> 00:30:36.868
ONLY.

00:30:36.935 --> 00:30:39.204
THEIR INDIVIDUAL UNITS.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:39.804
BUT ALSO THE DEVELOPMENT AS A

00:30:39.871 --> 00:30:40.505
WHOLE.

00:30:40.572 --> 00:30:41.639
IN ANTICIPATES THAT

00:30:41.706 --> 00:30:43.308
INVESTIGATION OF COMMON AREA

00:30:43.374 --> 00:30:44.676
DEFECTS COULD REQUIRE.

00:30:44.742 --> 00:30:46.277
INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS TO PERMIT

00:30:46.344 --> 00:30:47.645
ACCESS AND TESTING THAT AFFECT

00:30:47.712 --> 00:30:49.147
THEIR UNITS.

00:30:49.214 --> 00:30:51.082
SO WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU AT

00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:54.118
LEAST. TO PRESERVE A DISCLOSURE

00:30:54.185 --> 00:30:56.621
REQUIREMENTS. TO THE HOMEOWNERS

00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:58.323
NOT TO THE BUILDER.

00:30:58.389 --> 00:31:00.091
NOT INVOLVING THE BUILDER.

00:31:00.158 --> 00:31:01.059
BUT TO THE HOMEOWNER SO THAT

00:31:01.125 --> 00:31:02.594
THEY KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:03.561
THE ACTION THE BOARDS TAKING

00:31:03.628 --> 00:31:05.196
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER

00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:12.503
CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:13.871
COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TOM SIR I'M

00:31:13.938 --> 00:31:15.406
HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CENTER FOR

00:31:15.473 --> 00:31:16.474
CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS

00:31:16.541 --> 00:31:18.109
ASSOCIATION LAW.

00:31:18.176 --> 00:31:20.712
WE DID SOME WORK LAST YEAR IN

00:31:20.778 --> 00:31:23.448
PREPARATION -- FOR ADDRESSING

00:31:23.514 --> 00:31:25.316
SENATE BILL SEVEN TWENTY ONE AND

00:31:25.383 --> 00:31:26.618
THEN OF COURSE WHEN THE C. ID'S

00:31:26.684 --> 00:31:28.319
WERE PULLED OUT OF THE BUILDING

00:31:28.386 --> 00:31:29.921
WE STOPPED WORKING.

00:31:29.988 --> 00:31:31.389
AND NOW WE'RE BACK HERE WITH

00:31:31.456 --> 00:31:33.191
WHAT WE HAD UNDERSTOOD WAS GOING

00:31:33.258 --> 00:31:35.560
TO BE RULES FOR C. ID'S.

00:31:35.627 --> 00:31:37.795
I WANT TO MAKE SOME. THREE

00:31:37.862 --> 00:31:39.030
SEVERAL POINTS HERE ABOUT ARE

00:31:39.097 --> 00:31:40.732
CONCERNED NUMBER ONE IS THAT

00:31:40.798 --> 00:31:43.167
THIS BILL DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL

00:31:43.234 --> 00:31:44.769
SEE ID'S IT INCLUDES ONLY

00:31:44.836 --> 00:31:46.070
CONDOMINIUMS.

00:31:46.137 --> 00:31:47.105
AND THAT LEAVES OUT SOME

00:31:47.171 --> 00:31:49.274
SIGNIFICANT CATEGORIES OF C.

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.476
ID'S TOTALLY UNPROTECTED THESE

00:31:51.542 --> 00:31:52.810
WOULD INCLUDE.

00:31:52.877 --> 00:31:54.712
A PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS IN

00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:55.580
COOPS.

00:31:55.647 --> 00:31:56.881
AND WE THINK THOSE SHOULD BE

00:31:56.948 --> 00:31:58.850
INCLUDED ALL SEE ID SHOULD BE

00:31:58.916 --> 00:32:00.785
INCLUDED IN THIS COVERAGE.

00:32:00.852 --> 00:32:03.454
SECONDLY IT EXTENDS THE SIX YEAR

00:32:03.521 --> 00:32:06.591
INSPECTION FRAMEWORK IN SEVEN

00:32:06.658 --> 00:32:08.259
TWENTY ONE IT EXTENDED OUT TEN

00:32:08.326 --> 00:32:09.260
NINE YEARS.

00:32:09.327 --> 00:32:11.296
AND THAT SEEMS TO US TO BE AN

00:32:11.362 --> 00:32:12.830
UNWARRANTED.

00:32:12.897 --> 00:32:16.034
ADDITIONAL RISK TO OF RESIDENTS

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.735
OF C. ID'S.

00:32:17.802 --> 00:32:20.104
A WINNER STAND THE JUSTIFICATION

00:32:20.171 --> 00:32:22.106
FOR THAT I'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT.

00:32:22.173 --> 00:32:24.342
THE BERKELEY BALCONY COLLAPSE

00:32:24.409 --> 00:32:27.412
OCCURRED LESS THAN NINE YEARS.

00:32:27.478 --> 00:32:28.479
FROM THE TIME THAT THE BUILDING

00:32:28.546 --> 00:32:30.982
WAS COMPLETED IN FIRST OCCUPY.

00:32:31.049 --> 00:32:32.450
SO THE NINE YEAR INSPECTION

00:32:32.517 --> 00:32:33.751
REGIME WOULD NOT OF CAUGHT THAT

00:32:33.818 --> 00:32:36.587
PARTICULAR SITUATION IT'S JUST

00:32:36.654 --> 00:32:38.222
NINE YEARS IS TOO LONG

00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:38.523
[inaudible]

00:32:38.589 --> 00:32:40.758
EXCUSE ME.

00:32:40.825 --> 00:32:42.126
ANOTHER CONCERN IS THAT THE

00:32:42.193 --> 00:32:44.429
INSPECTIONS THAT ARE MANDATED IN

00:32:44.495 --> 00:32:45.463
THIS BILL.

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:47.598
ARE CAN BE VISUAL INSPECTIONS

00:32:47.665 --> 00:32:48.399
ONLY.

00:32:48.466 --> 00:32:50.301
NOW LAST YEAR WE DID CONSULT

00:32:50.368 --> 00:32:52.303
WITH EXPERTS IN THE BROUGHT TO

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:54.472
OUR ATTENTION THE DIFFICULTY OF

00:32:54.539 --> 00:32:56.741
IDENTIFYING CALLED RISKS.

00:32:56.808 --> 00:32:59.610
OF COLLAPSE RATHER CATASTROPHE.

00:32:59.677 --> 00:33:02.447
FROM INSPECTIONS A LOW.

00:33:02.513 --> 00:33:04.816
SO THAT THESE INSPECTION SHOULD

00:33:04.882 --> 00:33:06.718
BE MUCH MORE RIGOROUS AND

00:33:06.784 --> 00:33:07.919
PREFERABLY.

00:33:07.985 --> 00:33:09.420
AN ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS SUCH

00:33:09.487 --> 00:33:10.822
AS LOW TESTING MIGHT BE

00:33:10.888 --> 00:33:14.625
CONSIDERED -- SO FOR THOSE

00:33:14.692 --> 00:33:17.328
REASONS BUT WE'RE AT THIS POINT

00:33:17.395 --> 00:33:18.429
WE'RE OPPOSED THANK YOU.

00:33:18.496 --> 00:33:19.797
GREAT THANK YOU IS THERE ANY

00:33:19.864 --> 00:33:22.300
ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION.

00:33:22.367 --> 00:33:23.401
OKAY SIGNAL BRING IT BACK TO THE

00:33:23.468 --> 00:33:25.002
COMMITTEE CALLERS ARE THERE ANY

00:33:25.069 --> 00:33:26.971
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SENATOR

00:33:27.038 --> 00:33:30.308
ROTH.

00:33:30.375 --> 00:33:31.476
I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION IS IF

00:33:31.542 --> 00:33:33.878
IF THERE'S A LIMITATION IN THE

00:33:33.945 --> 00:33:35.046
C. C. IN OURS CAN'T THE

00:33:35.113 --> 00:33:37.281
HOMEOWNERS VOTE TO PULL IT OUT

00:33:37.348 --> 00:33:40.885
OF THE SEA SOONERS.

00:33:40.952 --> 00:33:41.986
AND I THINK THIS GENERAL -- I

00:33:42.053 --> 00:33:43.421
DON'T CARE -- IN THIS CAN ANSWER

00:33:43.488 --> 00:33:44.856
THAT QUESTION THE PROBLEM THAT

00:33:44.922 --> 00:33:46.023
WE FIND IS IT IN THE SHE SHE IN

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:47.024
OURS THAT ORIGINALLY DRAFTED IT

00:33:47.091 --> 00:33:47.925
DOESN'T.

00:33:47.992 --> 00:33:50.928
IT PRECLUDES ANY CHANGES TO THE

00:33:50.995 --> 00:33:52.530
CC IN OUR THAT WOULD AFFECT THE

00:33:52.597 --> 00:33:54.332
DEVELOPER AND THEY PLAY INCLUDE

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:55.233
THAT IN THE SEATS YOU KNOW

00:33:55.299 --> 00:33:56.634
IMPRESSION CLARIFICATION IF WE

00:33:56.701 --> 00:33:59.003
DO SEE THAT -- IN THE C. C. NOT

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:01.005
AS A DEVELOPER ALREADY SORT OF

00:34:01.072 --> 00:34:03.274
IN BEDS -- PROVISION IN THERE

00:34:03.341 --> 00:34:04.575
THAT PREVENTS HOMEOWNERS

00:34:04.642 --> 00:34:06.210
ASSOCIATIONS FROM AMENDING THOSE

00:34:06.277 --> 00:34:07.945
TYPES PROVISIONS THE BENEFIT TO

00:34:08.012 --> 00:34:10.281
DEVELOPERS WITHOUT CONSENT FROM

00:34:10.348 --> 00:34:11.215
THE DEVELOPER WHICH OF COURSE

00:34:11.282 --> 00:34:14.752
THEY WOULD NEVER GIVE AS I'VE

00:34:14.819 --> 00:34:15.953
BEEN CHALLENGED.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.523
THE COURTS APPEL THE I DON'T I

00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:19.157
DON'T BELIEVE IT'S GONE THROUGH

00:34:19.223 --> 00:34:20.258
THE COURTS I WOULD FIND THAT.

00:34:20.324 --> 00:34:20.892
AMAZING THAT THE COURT WOULD OF

00:34:20.958 --> 00:34:22.026
UP.

00:34:22.093 --> 00:34:25.163
A POLL THAT SORT OF PROVISION.

00:34:25.229 --> 00:34:26.297
WHAT ARE THE KEY WELL WHAT'S THE

00:34:26.364 --> 00:34:28.166
VOTE REQUIREMENT WHEN YOU HAVE A

00:34:28.232 --> 00:34:30.001
VOTED VERY SAID SOMETIMES IT'S A

00:34:30.067 --> 00:34:31.235
MAJORITY OF SOMETIMES AS I'VE

00:34:31.302 --> 00:34:33.604
HEARD IS 80% TO THEY CAN INCLUDE

00:34:33.671 --> 00:34:34.739
WHATEVER THEY WANT AND IN THE

00:34:34.806 --> 00:34:36.340
SHE SEEN OUR SINCE THEY WRITE

00:34:36.407 --> 00:34:37.575
THIS ISSUE IN OURS?

00:34:37.642 --> 00:34:39.410
AND THEN -- BOOK.

00:34:39.477 --> 00:34:40.778
THE OPPOSITION SPOKE ABOUT THE

00:34:40.845 --> 00:34:42.713
CONSEQUENCES OF LITIGATION I'M

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:43.448
NOT.

00:34:43.514 --> 00:34:44.515
TOTALLY FAMILIAR WITH

00:34:44.582 --> 00:34:46.150
CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LITIGATION

00:34:46.217 --> 00:34:47.552
IS IT TYPICALLY.

00:34:47.618 --> 00:34:48.920
CONDUCTED ON A CONTINGENT FEE

00:34:48.986 --> 00:34:50.955
BASIS.

00:34:51.022 --> 00:34:53.291
TYPICALLY IT IS -- MOSTLY CLAIMS

00:34:53.357 --> 00:34:54.892
THEY'RE VERY EXPENSIVE TO PURSUE

00:34:54.959 --> 00:34:56.594
IN ALMOST ASSOCIATIONS ARE NOT

00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:57.628
SET UP TO HAVE THE FUNDS

00:34:57.695 --> 00:34:59.931
AVAILABLE TO HIRE LEGAL COUNSEL

00:34:59.997 --> 00:35:00.998
TO INVESTIGATE THE CLAIMS IN

00:35:01.065 --> 00:35:03.668
ORDER THEY EVEN HAVE THE ABILITY --

00:35:03.734 --> 00:35:04.969
TO OFTENTIMES HIGHER THE FOR ITS

00:35:05.036 --> 00:35:06.938
A CONSULTANTS THAT ARE NECESSARY

00:35:07.004 --> 00:35:08.039
TO INVESTIGATE THE CLAIMS IN

00:35:08.105 --> 00:35:09.674
SUPPORT OF LITIGATION.

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.609
AND SO -- THE TERM THE LAW FIRMS

00:35:11.676 --> 00:35:13.311
THAT ARE FROM OFTEN WILL TAKEN

00:35:13.377 --> 00:35:15.346
ON A CONTINGENCY FEE BASIS AND

00:35:15.413 --> 00:35:17.114
ALSO ADVANCE THE COSTS OF THE

00:35:17.181 --> 00:35:18.683
LITIGATION AND THEREFORE YOU

00:35:18.749 --> 00:35:19.750
KNOW THE RISK IS REALLY BORN

00:35:19.817 --> 00:35:22.153
MORE BY THE ATTORNEYS IN TERMS

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.655
OF PURSUING THE CLAIM VERSUS THE

00:35:24.722 --> 00:35:26.090
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS.

00:35:26.157 --> 00:35:26.757
THE ONE THAT GOES THROUGH HER TO

00:35:26.824 --> 00:35:27.592
MY QUESTION I UNDERSTAND

00:35:27.658 --> 00:35:28.960
INSPECTIONS AND DURING

00:35:29.026 --> 00:35:32.096
CONSTRUCTION DEFECT LITIGATION

00:35:32.163 --> 00:35:33.831
BUT OTHER THAN.

00:35:33.898 --> 00:35:35.166
OTHER THAN -- OPENING UP.

00:35:35.233 --> 00:35:36.601
THE DWELLING FOR AN INSPECTION

00:35:36.667 --> 00:35:38.169
FOR EXAMPLE WHAT OTHER

00:35:38.236 --> 00:35:40.037
CONSEQUENCES OF AND I GUESS THIS

00:35:40.104 --> 00:35:41.439
IS MORE DRESS THE OPPOSITION

00:35:41.506 --> 00:35:42.840
WHETHER CONSEQUENCES WOULD THERE

00:35:42.907 --> 00:35:46.711
BE -- TO THIS CONSTRUCTION

00:35:46.777 --> 00:35:48.613
DEFECT LITIGATION.

00:35:48.679 --> 00:35:49.881
IN A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT.

00:35:49.947 --> 00:35:51.983
THERE QUITE A FEW ONE IS THAT --

00:35:52.049 --> 00:35:53.851
WE DID HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF A CASE

00:35:53.918 --> 00:35:56.821
WHERE -- NINETEEN HOMEOWNERS GOT

00:35:56.888 --> 00:35:59.257
ASSESSED AND LEAN FOR FIFTY

00:35:59.323 --> 00:36:00.258
THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH.

00:36:00.324 --> 00:36:02.159
THAT THEIR DUES -- ASSESSMENTS

00:36:02.226 --> 00:36:04.562
CAN GO UP -- BUT WHY.

00:36:04.629 --> 00:36:06.497
BECAUSE IN THAT CASE THE BOARD

00:36:06.564 --> 00:36:08.833
LOST THE CASE AND THEY GOT THE

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.067
FENCED IN THERE ARE COSTS

00:36:10.134 --> 00:36:12.837
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT -- THAT GOT

00:36:12.904 --> 00:36:15.806
IMPOSED ON THE HOW THE

00:36:15.873 --> 00:36:17.842
HOMEOWNERS AND EXPERT FEES YEAH

00:36:17.909 --> 00:36:19.243
AND I I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:21.178
I DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS OF THAT

00:36:21.245 --> 00:36:23.581
BUT THAT WORKED OUT.

00:36:23.648 --> 00:36:24.649
BUT A BOLD STATEMENT WHEN YOU

00:36:24.715 --> 00:36:26.751
SEE THE CONSEQUENCES AND I'M

00:36:26.817 --> 00:36:27.685
JUST TRYING TO DRILL DOWN.

00:36:27.752 --> 00:36:29.287
THE ROAD EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE

00:36:29.353 --> 00:36:30.755
WHEN IT'S CONTINGENT LITIGATION

00:36:30.821 --> 00:36:33.424
YEAH I UNDERSTAND EXPERT COSTS

00:36:33.491 --> 00:36:36.060
BEING ASSESSED TO THE LOSER IN

00:36:36.127 --> 00:36:37.228
SOME CASES I DON'T KNOW

00:36:37.295 --> 00:36:39.196
CONSTRUCTION DEFECT IS THAT

00:36:39.263 --> 00:36:40.932
REQUIRED TO DESERVE HAVE TO BE A

00:36:40.998 --> 00:36:42.300
THE SETTLEMENT -- FOR THAT STERN

00:36:42.366 --> 00:36:45.202
DOWN IN ORDER TO RECOVER -- WILL

00:36:45.269 --> 00:36:46.404
THERE ARE NONE THE NINE NINE

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:47.905
EIGHT OFFERS BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT

00:36:47.972 --> 00:36:50.775
I WAS THINKING OF I'M TRYING TO

00:36:50.841 --> 00:36:52.243
PROBE WHAT YEAH IT DOESN'T.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:53.411
IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE BY

00:36:53.477 --> 00:36:56.581
SETTLEMENT IT CAN BE ALLEN

00:36:56.647 --> 00:36:58.382
USUALLY IS NOT BY SETTLEMENT AT

00:36:58.449 --> 00:37:00.217
WHERE YOU HAVE A DEFENSE VERDICT

00:37:00.284 --> 00:37:03.187
SO YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THE TRIAL.

00:37:03.254 --> 00:37:05.523
AND AT AT AND THERE'S A VERDICT

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:12.496
AND THE BOARD IN THAT CASE LOST.

00:37:12.563 --> 00:37:13.431
THE CASE -- I AND I AND I CAN'T

00:37:13.497 --> 00:37:14.732
SPEAK TO THE DETAILS OF THAT

00:37:14.799 --> 00:37:15.533
PARTICULAR CASES.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.668
TO WHAT THOSE COSTS WERE --

00:37:17.735 --> 00:37:18.803
WHETHER THEY'RE EXPERT COSTS BUT

00:37:18.869 --> 00:37:19.971
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT

00:37:20.037 --> 00:37:21.539
AFFECT IN THAT WE CAME AS A

00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:23.174
SURPRISE TO HOMEOWNERS.

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.375
WHEN THEY WANT TO SELL OR

00:37:24.442 --> 00:37:26.010
REFINANCE THEIR HOMES BECAUSE

00:37:26.077 --> 00:37:27.278
THEY FOUND THAT?

00:37:27.345 --> 00:37:29.213
REFINANCING WAS MADE DIFFICULT

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.482
THEY COULDN'T DO A CONFORMING

00:37:31.549 --> 00:37:33.517
LOAN BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT

00:37:33.584 --> 00:37:35.119
SPONSORED ENTITIES WOULD NOT.

00:37:35.186 --> 00:37:36.921
ENSURE THE LOAN BECAUSE THERE

00:37:36.988 --> 00:37:38.823
WAS LITIGATION PENDING AND THAT

00:37:38.889 --> 00:37:39.991
WHEN THEY WANT TO SELL THEIR

00:37:40.057 --> 00:37:40.958
HOMES.

00:37:41.025 --> 00:37:42.927
THEY FOUND THAT PEOPLE

00:37:42.994 --> 00:37:44.295
SURPRISINGLY DON'T WHAT WE WERE

00:37:44.362 --> 00:37:45.930
TRYING TO BUY A HOME DON'T WANT

00:37:45.997 --> 00:37:47.398
TO BITE INTO LIIGATION.

00:37:47.465 --> 00:37:49.100
SO THE THE PRICES THAT THEY

00:37:49.166 --> 00:37:51.736
COULD SELL THEIR HOME FOR IS

00:37:51.802 --> 00:37:52.436
DEPRESSED.

00:37:52.503 --> 00:37:53.404
AND THEN FINALLY THEY ARE

00:37:53.471 --> 00:37:55.039
REQUIRED BY LAW TO DISCLOSE THE

00:37:55.106 --> 00:37:58.943
CLAIM -- IT TO FUTURE POTENTIAL

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:00.011
BUYERS.

00:38:00.077 --> 00:38:01.746
AND THAT TRIGGERS SOME OTHER

00:38:01.812 --> 00:38:03.381
ADDITIONAL ISSUES AS TO HOW WAS

00:38:03.447 --> 00:38:05.182
IT RESOLVED WAS THE PROBLEM

00:38:05.249 --> 00:38:07.351
FIXED WAS IT SOMEBODY RECEIVE A

00:38:07.418 --> 00:38:08.052
CASH PAYMENT.

00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:10.221
AND TODAY FIX THE PROBLEM WITH

00:38:10.287 --> 00:38:13.124
THAT -- THOSE SORTS OF THINGS

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:15.259
THAT YOU'RE REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE --

00:38:15.326 --> 00:38:15.793
THE COULD THE CONSTRUCTION

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.728
DEFECT IN THE PROBLEM ANYWAY IN

00:38:17.795 --> 00:38:19.196
THE SALES DOCUMENTS ORANGE YOU

00:38:19.263 --> 00:38:20.731
ARE BUT YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW

00:38:20.798 --> 00:38:23.234
FEW PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THAT AND

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:24.769
THEN THEY WISHED THEY WISH FACT

00:38:24.835 --> 00:38:26.003
THAT THEY HAVE TO DISCLOSE IT

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:27.571
RIGHT AND THEY'D LIKE TO KNOW

00:38:27.638 --> 00:38:29.874
THAT AT THE TIME THAT THE CLAIM.

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:32.276
ARISES BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO

00:38:32.343 --> 00:38:34.412
BE THROUGH WHETHER THIS PLANNED

00:38:34.478 --> 00:38:36.080
OR WHETHER IT'S STILL BEING

00:38:36.147 --> 00:38:37.281
TRANSFERRED FOR JOB.

00:38:37.348 --> 00:38:39.950
THE THEY NEED TO SELL THEIR HOME

00:38:40.017 --> 00:38:42.553
AND THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT THEY

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:45.256
SHOULD DISCLOSE THAT -- AND THAT

00:38:45.322 --> 00:38:48.859
HAS -- IT HAS AN IMPACT ON THEM.

00:38:48.926 --> 00:38:49.593
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT LAST

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:50.961
COMMENT THE BROKER WOULD HAVE AN

00:38:51.028 --> 00:38:52.229
OBLIGATION.

00:38:52.296 --> 00:38:54.832
TO DO WITH THAT BUT I I WON'T

00:38:54.899 --> 00:38:55.433
BELABOR THIS MISTER THANK YOU

00:38:55.499 --> 00:38:57.601
SIR.

00:38:57.668 --> 00:38:58.135
COULD I HAVE A MY WITNESS

00:38:58.202 --> 00:38:59.236
RESPOND YES.

00:38:59.303 --> 00:39:00.638
BUT ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS THE

00:39:00.705 --> 00:39:02.073
OPPOSITION MAKES IS THAT THE

00:39:02.139 --> 00:39:03.674
HOMEOWNERS MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE

00:39:03.741 --> 00:39:05.776
IMPACT -- AS A RESULT OF THE

00:39:05.843 --> 00:39:06.911
LITIGATION AND WHAT THEY'RE

00:39:06.977 --> 00:39:08.913
TALKING ABOUT IS -- IN TERMS OF

00:39:08.979 --> 00:39:11.282
UNIT SALES AND A REFINANCING

00:39:11.348 --> 00:39:13.050
DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE CLAN --

00:39:13.117 --> 00:39:15.653
THAT IS TRUE THAT THERE IS --

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.521
SOME IMPACT WHILE THE CLAIM IS

00:39:17.588 --> 00:39:19.090
PENDING IN DEPENDING ON HOW LONG

00:39:19.156 --> 00:39:21.092
THAT PROCESS IS DROWNED OUT BY

00:39:21.158 --> 00:39:22.893
THE DEFENSE IN THE DEVELOPER --

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.328
IT COULD BE FROM YOU KNOW TWELVE

00:39:24.395 --> 00:39:25.730
MONTHS TO THIRTY SIX MONTHS

00:39:25.796 --> 00:39:26.464
WHILE THE CLAIM IS PENDING

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:27.364
HOWEVER.

00:39:27.431 --> 00:39:29.600
IN MY EXPERIENCE THE VAST

00:39:29.667 --> 00:39:32.169
MAJORITIES CLAIMS RESOLVE BY A

00:39:32.236 --> 00:39:32.470
SETTLEMENT.

00:39:32.536 --> 00:39:35.072
AND ALMOST ASSOCIATIONS ARE IN A

00:39:35.139 --> 00:39:36.941
FAR BETTER POSITION AFTER THE

00:39:37.007 --> 00:39:38.175
CLAIM IS RESOLVED BECAUSE THEY

00:39:38.242 --> 00:39:39.577
HAVE THE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO

00:39:39.643 --> 00:39:42.046
REPAIR CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS IN

00:39:42.113 --> 00:39:42.613
DANGEROUS CONDITIONS OF THE

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.749
PROPERTY -- IN ORDER TO KEEP THE

00:39:44.815 --> 00:39:46.350
DUES DOWN AND PREVENT SPECIAL

00:39:46.417 --> 00:39:47.251
ASSESSMENTS.

00:39:47.318 --> 00:39:49.553
UP THE THE ARGUMENT THAT IT

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:50.855
IMPACTS.

00:39:50.921 --> 00:39:52.923
SALES DURING THE THE PERIOD IS

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:55.760
OF LITIGATION IS IN FACT -- AN

00:39:55.826 --> 00:39:57.228
ARGUMENT IN SUPPORT OF LIFE

00:39:57.294 --> 00:39:59.063
HOMEOWNERS -- SHOULD NOT BE

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:00.898
MAKING THE DECISION TO PURSUE A

00:40:00.965 --> 00:40:02.666
CLAIM AND BOARD SHOULD BECAUSE

00:40:02.733 --> 00:40:03.968
THE HOMEOWNERS DON'T HAVE A

00:40:04.034 --> 00:40:05.936
FIDUCIARY OBLIGATION TO THE REST

00:40:06.003 --> 00:40:08.305
OF THE MEMBERSHIP -- AS A WHOLE

00:40:08.372 --> 00:40:10.074
AS DO THE BOARD MEMBERS THE

00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:11.208
BOARD HAVE TO HAS TO LOOK OUT

00:40:11.275 --> 00:40:12.576
FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF THE

00:40:12.643 --> 00:40:14.478
ASSOCIATION -- IF A HOMEOWNER

00:40:14.545 --> 00:40:15.679
HAS A CONCERNED THAT OF

00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:17.281
LITIGATION COULD AFFECT THE OUR

00:40:17.348 --> 00:40:19.116
MEDIA NEED TO SELL THEIR

00:40:19.183 --> 00:40:20.317
PROPERTY IF YOU HAVE A HOMEOWNER.

00:40:20.384 --> 00:40:21.519
HE WANTS TO SELL THE NEXT SIX

00:40:21.585 --> 00:40:23.020
MONTHS OR TWELVE MONTHS AND THEY

00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:24.221
DON'T WANT TO HAVE THIS CLOUD OF

00:40:24.288 --> 00:40:25.556
LITIGATION OVER IT THAT MIGHT

00:40:25.623 --> 00:40:28.125
IMPACT THEIR OWN PERSONAL --

00:40:28.192 --> 00:40:30.361
DESIRE TO SELL THEIR UNIT THAT'S

00:40:30.427 --> 00:40:31.729
A CONFLICT OF INTEREST THAT THEY

00:40:31.796 --> 00:40:33.197
HAVE IT'S NOT IN THE BENEFIT OF

00:40:33.264 --> 00:40:34.698
THE HOMEOWNERS THAT ARE GOING TO

00:40:34.765 --> 00:40:35.933
BE THERE FOR THE LONG TERM.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.067
AND WOULD BE SADDLED WITH THE

00:40:37.134 --> 00:40:39.136
EXPENSE OF HAVING TO PAY FOR A

00:40:39.203 --> 00:40:41.672
DEFECT REPAIRS IF THE CLAIM WAS

00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:44.041
PURSUED IN SELF FOR THAT REASON --

00:40:44.108 --> 00:40:46.143
HOMEOWNERS WHO DO NOT HAVE TO

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:47.344
SHARE OBLIGATION TO ONE ANOTHER

00:40:47.411 --> 00:40:48.212
SHOULD NOT BE MAKING THE

00:40:48.279 --> 00:40:49.480
DECISION TO PURSUE A CLAIM

00:40:49.547 --> 00:40:50.714
RATHER IT SHOULD BE THE BOARD

00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:59.757
WHO HAS A FIDUCIARY OBLIGATION --

00:40:59.824 --> 00:41:00.357
TO ACT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF

00:41:00.424 --> 00:41:01.592

00:42:25.876 --> 00:42:28.212
WITH THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY

00:42:28.279 --> 00:42:29.613
AND FOCUS.

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.382
THAT COULD BE BROUGHT TO THE

00:42:31.448 --> 00:42:33.684
ISSUE OUT WHEN THE ENTIRE

00:42:33.751 --> 00:42:34.485
MEMBERSHIP.

00:42:34.551 --> 00:42:36.220
DOESN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:42:36.287 --> 00:42:37.121
BE INVOLVED IN THAT FINAL

00:42:37.187 --> 00:42:39.156
DECISION THE REASON BEING I'VE

00:42:39.223 --> 00:42:40.024
BEEN.

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:42.526
A MEMBER OF AN H. AWAY WHERE

00:42:42.593 --> 00:42:44.128
WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF FILE.

00:42:44.194 --> 00:42:46.263
LITIGIOUS SITUATIONS IN WHICH

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:47.932
ONE WENT ARE NOT IN OUR FAVOR

00:42:47.998 --> 00:42:49.967
AND WE DID HAVE AN EXTRA SAUCE

00:42:50.034 --> 00:42:50.200
MEANT.

00:42:50.267 --> 00:42:52.236
NOT AS LARGE AS SOME THAT ARE

00:42:52.303 --> 00:42:53.504
DISCUSSED HERE.

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:55.272
SO I'M CONCERNED AS TO WHY WE

00:42:55.339 --> 00:42:57.741
WOULD BE SO WORRIED ABOUT.

00:42:57.808 --> 00:43:00.077
THEM VOTING OR NOT BUILDING WHEN

00:43:00.144 --> 00:43:01.045
YOU HAVE PEOPLE ON THE BOARD

00:43:01.111 --> 00:43:03.314
POTENTIALLY IMPACTED BY THIS

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:04.448
SAME THING.

00:43:04.515 --> 00:43:06.417
IN THERE ARE NOT PREVENTED FROM

00:43:06.483 --> 00:43:08.252
WHAT I KNOW OF THE WAY IT'S

00:43:08.319 --> 00:43:09.620
OPERATED IN MY COMMUNITY.

00:43:09.687 --> 00:43:11.155
THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY

00:43:11.221 --> 00:43:15.993
REQUIRED TO OPT OUT.

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:17.061
OF A DECISION WHEN IT AFFECTS

00:43:17.127 --> 00:43:17.661
THEM ALSO.

00:43:17.728 --> 00:43:19.797
BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOT ENGAGE THE

00:43:19.863 --> 00:43:21.098
ENTIRE MEMBERSHIP WHEN IT

00:43:21.165 --> 00:43:23.867
AFFECTS THE ENTIRE ENTIRE TEAM

00:43:23.934 --> 00:43:24.802
INCLUDING ME ON THE CORD.

00:43:24.868 --> 00:43:26.537
I HAVE SOME SORT OF PROTECTION

00:43:26.603 --> 00:43:29.006
THAT I AM NOT IN CONFLICT BUT

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:30.341
WHEN IT HAPPENS TO BE MY HOME

00:43:30.407 --> 00:43:32.543
AND I WON'T GO INTO A COUPLE IN

00:43:32.609 --> 00:43:33.310
OUR CITIES.

00:43:33.377 --> 00:43:35.946
IN OUR FUTURE WAY THAT THIS DID

00:43:36.013 --> 00:43:38.382
A FACTOR -- BEYOND THE ODD THOSE

00:43:38.449 --> 00:43:40.050
OTHERS ARE DRAWN INTO MAYBE THE

00:43:40.117 --> 00:43:41.719
ARGUMENT THAT TWO OR THREE

00:43:41.785 --> 00:43:43.354

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:44.188
DIFFERENT LET'S SAY THEY HAVE A

00:43:44.254 --> 00:43:47.624
DIFFERENT STYLE HOME IN A YOU

00:43:47.691 --> 00:43:49.593
KNOW MASTER PLANNED COMMUNITY.

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.495
THEIR PLAN THREE AND FOUR WHICH

00:43:51.562 --> 00:43:52.563
HAS THE DEFECTS IN THE OTHER

00:43:52.629 --> 00:43:55.265
GUYS DON'T BUT THEY WANT THE THE

00:43:55.332 --> 00:43:57.935
HOLD ASSOCIATION TO BE IN THEIR

00:43:58.002 --> 00:43:59.203
CAMP.

00:43:59.269 --> 00:44:00.037
SO THEY'LL VOTE FOR AND I THINK

00:44:00.104 --> 00:44:02.206
THOSE ARE CONCERNS THAT BY NOT

00:44:02.272 --> 00:44:03.974
INVOLVING THE WHOLE MEMBERSHIP --

00:44:04.041 --> 00:44:06.243
IF NOT A VOTE SOME THING THAT'S

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:08.345
VERY OPEN AND DIRECT ABOUT

00:44:08.412 --> 00:44:10.347
WHAT'S GOING ON SO THEY HAVE AN

00:44:10.414 --> 00:44:11.849
OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAL.

00:44:11.915 --> 00:44:14.752
FLORA IS REALLY -- TO ME LACK OF

00:44:14.818 --> 00:44:16.320
ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY

00:44:16.387 --> 00:44:17.855
ON THE PART OF THE BOARD OF

00:44:17.921 --> 00:44:18.922
DIRECTORS AND THOSE WHO WERE

00:44:18.989 --> 00:44:20.157
INVOLVED AT THIS YOU GUYS KNOW

00:44:20.224 --> 00:44:21.191
THERE'S ALWAYS.

00:44:21.258 --> 00:44:21.759
PROBLEMS WITH THE BOARD OF

00:44:21.825 --> 00:44:23.794
DIRECTORS AND SOMEBODY GOT ON

00:44:23.861 --> 00:44:25.429
BECAUSE THEY WANTED A BASKETBALL

00:44:25.496 --> 00:44:26.663
YOU KNOW.

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:28.265
WHO FUND THEIR FRIEND ON THEIR

00:44:28.332 --> 00:44:29.500
GARAGE FOR THEIR KID NOBODY ELSE

00:44:29.566 --> 00:44:31.068
WANTED IT SO THEY HAVE SOMETHING

00:44:31.135 --> 00:44:31.969
THAT ALLOW THAT?

00:44:32.036 --> 00:44:34.171
THIS HAPPENS QUITE A BIT AND I

00:44:34.238 --> 00:44:40.077
HAPPEN TO REPRESENT COMMUNITIES

00:44:40.144 --> 00:44:40.711
THAT.

00:44:40.778 --> 00:44:41.879
I THINK MOST OF THE COMMUNITIES

00:44:41.945 --> 00:44:42.980
OF SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY.

00:44:43.047 --> 00:44:45.149
THAT WERE DEVELOPED IN THE LATE

00:44:45.215 --> 00:44:45.816
EIGHTIES NINETIES OUR H. AWAY --

00:44:45.883 --> 00:44:46.383
THERE'S VERY FEW THAT ARE

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:48.152
VOLUNTARY SO YOU ARE REALLY AT

00:44:48.218 --> 00:44:49.420
THE MERCY OF THE PEOPLE THEY GET

00:44:49.486 --> 00:44:50.854
ELECTED TO THOSE BOARDS AND

00:44:50.921 --> 00:44:52.089
SOMETIMES.

00:44:52.156 --> 00:44:53.857
THEY'RE TIRED THEY DON'T THAT

00:44:53.924 --> 00:44:55.325
HAPPEN IN MY ASSOCIATION THEY

00:44:55.392 --> 00:44:58.429
WILL TOTAL TURNOVER BECAUSE TO

00:44:58.495 --> 00:45:00.030
THE PEOPLE HAVE HAD IT.

00:45:00.097 --> 00:45:02.332
SO I DO BELIEVE THE THE ENTIRE

00:45:02.399 --> 00:45:03.834
MEMBERSHIP NEEDS HELP SOME

00:45:03.901 --> 00:45:06.637
SIGNIFICANT -- PARTY IN THE

ONE WEEK FROM THE STATUTE OF

INCIDENT.

00:46:17.241 --> 00:46:19.576
BUT THIS ONE I THINK IS REALLY A

00:46:19.643 --> 00:46:21.612
REALLY -- REACHING TOO FAR IN

00:46:21.678 --> 00:46:23.113
TERMS OF WHERE YOU GIVE

THEY HAVE THEIR HOME.

00:46:42.866 --> 00:46:44.201
AND THAT FLOW SIGNIFICANT WHEN

00:46:44.268 --> 00:46:45.435
YOU HAVE A CLOUD PUT OVER THAT

00:46:45.502 --> 00:46:46.770
BECAUSE OF LAWSUITS THAT COULD

00:46:46.837 --> 00:46:48.572

00:46:49.039 --> 00:46:50.440
THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS AND THE

00:46:50.507 --> 00:46:52.442

00:46:55.946 --> 00:46:57.047
LITTLE BIT I DO FEEL AND MY

00:46:57.114 --> 00:46:57.814

THESE H..

00:46:59.683 --> 00:47:00.751

00:47:05.022 --> 00:47:07.424
LEAN PROPERTY ALL THE TIME --IN

00:47:07.491 --> 00:47:08.592
DIFFERENT CASES THEY HAVE A

00:47:08.659 --> 00:47:10.594
FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE

00:47:10.661 --> 00:47:11.895
SURE THAT THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE

00:47:11.962 --> 00:47:13.397
FOR THOSE DECISIONS.

00:47:13.463 --> 00:47:14.731
THE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE

00:47:14.798 --> 00:47:17.167
RELATED TO LITIGATION ARE BASED

00:47:17.234 --> 00:47:19.903
ON OF A MEETING WHERE THE

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:20.837
INFORMATION IS BROUGHT TO THE

00:47:20.904 --> 00:47:21.939
HOMEOWNERS SO THERE IS A PUBLIC

00:47:22.005 --> 00:47:24.408
COMPENSATION AROUND THIS.

00:47:24.474 --> 00:47:26.243
AND AND AGAIN THE THE FACT THAT

AT THE GROUP AS A WHOLE AND I

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:46.930
THINK -- MISTER BROWN HAD A

00:47:46.997 --> 00:47:49.766
COMMENT.

CHAIR RIVER.

00:47:50.601 --> 00:47:53.070
THANK YOU I DO I THINK IT'S

00:47:53.136 --> 00:47:54.238
IMPORTANT JUST TO CLARIFY THAT.

00:47:54.304 --> 00:47:55.906
THE BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT VOTES

00:47:55.973 --> 00:47:58.008
FROM BEING IN AMENDED INTO THE

THAT ASSOCIATION SO CHOOSES SO

00:48:19.863 --> 00:48:22.399
THE IDEA IS TO IS REALLY TO

00:48:22.466 --> 00:48:23.734
LEAVE THESE DECISIONS ON WHETHER

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.502

WRITTEN BY THE DEVELOPER.

OTHER OBSTRUCTIONS WITHIN IT

00:48:37.281 --> 00:48:38.982
PREVENTING THOSE CHANGES TO TO

01:10:50.079 --> 01:10:52.615
MOST HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS ARE

01:10:52.681 --> 01:10:55.250

TORONTO.

01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:22.745
MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE

01:11:22.811 --> 01:11:23.379
COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF

THE COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION'S

INSTITUTE FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION

01:11:26.749 --> 01:11:28.584
COMMITTEE -- I THINK THESE TWO

01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:29.852
INDIVIDUALS ARE VERY WELL THERE

01:11:29.918 --> 01:11:31.620
ARE FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND SO SHE

01:11:31.687 --> 01:11:32.254
XIN SO IN THE STATE OF

01:11:32.321 --> 01:11:33.455
CALIFORNIA THE BILL WAS VETOED

01:11:33.522 --> 01:11:34.757
LAST YEAR.

01:11:34.823 --> 01:11:36.458
GOVERNOR BROWN SAYS WITH A ONE

01:11:36.525 --> 01:11:37.826
SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH.

01:11:37.893 --> 01:11:39.595
THERE ARE BAD ACTORS WE KNOW

01:11:39.662 --> 01:11:41.363
THAT IN EVERY INDUSTRY WE'VE

01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:43.932
TALKED ABOUT IT PREVIOUSLY TODAY --

01:11:43.999 --> 01:11:46.702
AND YET THIS IS A AN APPROACH

01:11:46.769 --> 01:11:48.137
THAT TRIES TO PUT EVERYONE IN

01:11:48.203 --> 01:11:49.972
ONE BOX AND I THINK MANY OF THE

01:11:50.039 --> 01:11:51.807
SITUATIONS IN INSTANCES THAT WE

01:11:51.874 --> 01:11:53.175
HEARD OF BY THE PROPONENTS.

01:11:53.242 --> 01:11:54.843
MAY NOT GET CURED AS A RESULT OF

01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:57.179
THIS BILL BUT WHAT WE WILL DO IS

01:11:57.246 --> 01:11:58.847
PENALIZE THE GOOD ACTORS OUT

01:11:58.914 --> 01:12:00.015
THERE WITH SOME ADDITIONAL

01:12:00.082 --> 01:12:01.483
ACTIVITIES AND POTENTIAL COSTS.

01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:02.818
WITH THAT BEING SAID I DO WANT

01:12:02.885 --> 01:12:04.853
TO ACKNOWLEDGE.

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.321

01:12:16.298 --> 01:12:17.966
WE DO HAVE A PHILOSOPHICAL

01:12:18.033 --> 01:12:20.536
OBJECTION TO THE IDEA OF NOT

01:12:20.602 --> 01:12:22.104
ALLOWING AN ASSOCIATION TO SET

CONCERNED WITH OVER THE LAST TWO

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:30.612

01:12:30.679 --> 01:12:32.481
BEEN RESOLVED IN AND IN SOME

01:12:32.548 --> 01:12:33.215
