AND WE WILL PICK UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF YESTERDAY [inaudible] FOR THE SORRY AS FOLKS AGAIN PHILIP THE TABLE WILL GO AHEAD AND CALL WORLD ESTABLISH SHARK MORE. SENATORS METAL HERE. WARLOCK [inaudible] NIELSEN [inaudible] ROTH. SKINNER YEAH ASSEMBLY MEMBER STING [inaudible] MAYES [inaudible] MCCARTY [inaudible] OBERNOLTE. WEBER HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYONE -- JUST A REMINDER -- WE'RE GONNA HAVE A HARD STOP TODAY AT ONE THIRTY OUR GOAL IS TO COMPLETE EDUCATION. AND COMPLETE RESOURCES AND TRANSPORTATION WITH THAT WE'RE STARTING ON PAGE THIRTY SEVEN ISSUES THIRTY FOUR WE ARE IN HIGHER ED UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA C. ISSUE FACULTY GOOD MORNING REPRESENTED FROM THE LA -- WHAT WE GET STARTED REASON CONCENTRA SLUDGE ANALYST'S OFFICE? OF THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU IS AN ASSEMBLY ACTION RELATED TO FACULTY DIVERSITY. OFFER SOME CONTEXT -- IN RECENT YEARS THE STATE HAS PROVIDED SOME ONE TIME FUNDING FOR BOTH TO UC AND CSU TO EXPAND -- PRACTICES AND AND TEST NEW WAYS TO IMPROVE THE DIVERSITY OF THE FACULTY HIRES. AND THE OVERALL INTENT OF THE ASSEMBLY ACTION IS TO TRY TO EXPAND THOSE ONE TIME EFFORTS ON ON ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND ACROSS THE SYSTEM -- THE ACTIONS ARE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FOR UC AND CSU IN THE CASE OF YOU SEE THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSES A FOUR POINT SIX MILLION AN ON GOING FUNDING -- TO RAMP UP. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY BEST PRACTICES FOR CSU THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTS A BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD. EXPEDITE LEGISLATIVE EXPECTATIONS THAT CSU INCORPORATE BEST PRACTICES INTO ITS HIRING DECISIONS -- AS YOU THINK ABOUT THESE DIFFERENT APPROACHES AND DIFFERENT PROPOSALS FOR THE TO IMPROVE FACULTY DIVERSITY WE ENCOURAGE LEGISLATOR LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WAYS -- TO EXPAND PRACTICES ACROSS THE ENTIRE SYSTEM AND EXPAND PRACTICES USING ITS ENTIRE BUDGET AND INCORPORATE THE MOST UP TO DATE INFORMATION AND ALL OF ITS HIRING DECISIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FINANCE MY COLLEAGUES ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING. MORNING CHRIS FERGUSON WITH FINANCE I THINK WE JUST FELT THE WE DID NOT INCLUDE A PROPOSAL REGARDING EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. HOWEVER ON THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR LANGUAGE FOR FULL TIME FACULTY THAT'S LARGELY CONSISTENT WITH AN ACTION TAKEN IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET -- OUT GROUP WHICH SHOP FINANCE DID NOT HAVE CONCERNS WITH. GOT IT QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR MEMBERS MISTER MOORE LÃ . I'M JUST CURIOUS MADAM CHAIR IF IF THERE'S A STUDY THAT'S BEEN DONE [inaudible] TO KIND OF ENCOURAGE THE EFFICACY OF TENURE -- IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S A GOOD THING. OR IS TURN YOUR NOT. DOING WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. WITH THE MCCARTY SAID PAGING DR WEBER OF SENATOR SKINNER AND DOCTOR WEBER CAN UPON IF SHE SO CHOOSES THEN SKINNER. I AM NOT AWARE OF SUCH STORIES ON TENURE BUT TENURE TRACK IS ONE OF IS THE MAIN WAY. THAT ARE CSU SYSTEM IN OUR UC SYSTEM. HIRE PERMANENT FULL TIME FACULTY SO IN OTHER WORDS. IF YOU'RE NOT ON TENURE TRACK YOU TEND NOT TO BE A FULL TIME -- IN A FULL TIME FACULTY POSITION FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE A LECTURER THAT TENDS TO BE PART TIME THERE'S OTHER PART TIME TYPE POSITIONS. AND THE REASON I AM SUPPORTIVE OF EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF FULL TIME WHICH IN THIS CASE IT IN THESE CATEGORIES ARE OF TENURE TRACK. IS HAVING -- TAUGHT AT VARIOUS UC'S OVER THE YEARS PRIMARILY AS A PART TIME EITHER LECTURE OTHER CATEGORY. I DO NOT HAVE AN OFFICE. I COULD NOT HAVE OFFICE HOURS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE AN OFFICE AND SINCE I WAS ONLY PART TIME I HAD OTHER JOBS SO MY ABILITY TO SPEND TIME WITH ANY OF MY STUDENTS OUTSIDE OF CLASS. WAS PRETTY RESTRICTED AND AS WE KNOW STUDENT SUCCESS IS OFTEN DEPENDENT ON THEIR ABILITY TO INTERACT. WITH THEIR INSTRUCTOR OR IF IT'S A LARGE ENOUGH CLASS THERE TA SO -- BOTH IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM AND OUR UC AND CSU SYSTEM I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF OUR MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE AS MANY FULL TIME FACULTY AS POSSIBLE. BUT TO OUR RESERVATION LOOK AND I GUESS I SHOULD SAY SOMETHING YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO OUT ON THERE HAVE BEEN SOME WORK DONE ON ON TEN YEAR CONTINUE TRACK THE PROBLEM I THINK WITH MOST FOLKS IS THEY MISUNDERSTAND WHAT TENURE AREAS IN TEN YEARS NO MORE THAN. SAYING YOUR PERMIT FACULTY WITH CERTAIN RIGHTS NOW IS ONCE YOU ACQUIRE TENURE IT'S NOT A PERMANENT THING I'VE KNOWN FOLKS WHO'VE BEEN FIRED WHO IT TENURE. OF LORD NOT DOING THEIRJOB AND NOT PERFORMING AT A LEVEL THEY SHOULD BE A DISMISS THIS REGARDING STUDENTS SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT SAYS YOU CAN NEVER BE FIRED AGAIN. BUT IT SAYS THAT IF THEY'RE GOING TO DO ANY ACTION ON YOU YOU HAVE TO AT LEAST DO HAVE DUE PROCESS AFTER YEARS OF WORKING THERE. HAVE TO NOTIFY YOU THAT TO TRY TO REMEDIATE WHAT'S GOING ON THAT THAT KIND OF STUFF AND SO AS A RESULT IT IS NOT A PERMANENT JOB THING BUT IT'S ABOUT. STATUS AS THE ONE OF THINGS THAT DID HAPPEN AND AND AND I WENT TO THE HEARING I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER WHAT COMMITTEE DID I THINK IT WAS HIGHER IT AND IT HAD A COMMITTEE. I HAD A MEETING AT SAN JOSE A FEW YEARS BACK CONCERNING ALL ALL STUDENT SUCCESS AND WOULD HELP TO STUDENT SUCCESS. AND THEY TALKED ABOUT -- DIVERSITY OF FACULTY. THAT STUDENTS IF THEY HAVE FACULTY THAT LOOK LIKE THEM THAT HAVE BASICALLY UNDERSTAND THEIR AGENDA AND WHAT'S GOING ON THEY HAVE A GREATER SENSE OF OF SURVIVING AND REMAINING IN THAT INSTITUTION SO THAT. SO THAT WAS REAL CLEAR VERY STRONG AMONG COMMUNITY COLLEGES WELL AS OTHERS. IT ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT A PART OF BEING FACULTY IS MENTORING AND SUPPORTING STUDENTS. AND WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF UNTIL NEW FACULTY THEN -- YOU DON'T YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY OF THEM TO BASICALLY BE WOULD STUDENTS FOR THE LONG HAUL IT MAY BE HERE TODAY BUT IF IF YOU I WAS A FULL PROFESSOR TENURE FACULTY FOR FORTY YEARS AND SO AS A RESULT. YOU KNOW I WALK THROUGH STUDENTS THROUGH THE PROCESS OF NOT ONLY UNDERGRADUATE BUT ALSO GRADUATE EDUCATION IN TERMS OF BEING A MENTOR SUPPORTER THEY KNEW WHERE I WAS WE HAD OFFICE HOURS YOU COULD HELP TO THOSE KIND OF THINGS. AND THAT'S CRITICAL IN TERMS OF STUDENT SUCCESS -- ALSO WHAT'S EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT INSTITUTIONS SUPPOSEDLY RUN BY TENURED FACULTY. THE WHOLE ISSUE OF FACULTY COLLABORATION THE ACADEMIC SENATE ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AS A FACULTY MEMBER I WAS ON PERSONNEL COMMITTEES I WAS ON RECRUITMENT COMMITTEES I WAS ON CURRICULUM COMMITTEES IN THE SENATE. SO WE WERE BASICALLY THE WHOLE IDEA OF COLLEGIALITY AND RUNNING THE INSTITUTION LIES IN THE HANDS OF THE TENURED FACULTY -- SO THAT'S A PART OF THEIR WORKFLOW TO BASICALLY HELP RUN THE INSTITUTIONS SO IT HAS A A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT IT THAT'S GOOD IT HAS SOME THINGS THAT ARE OBVIOUSLY MISUSED. AND AND IT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE FACULTY THE CAMPUS TO CORRECT THOSE THINGS WHEN THEY ARE WHEN THAT WHEN THAT TENURE STATUS IS MISUSED. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES I WAS VERY HELPFUL THANK YOUTHANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON ISSUE. THIRTY FOUR THANK YOU WILL MOVE ON ISSUE THIRTY FIVE SUPPORT PROGRAMS FOR FORMALLY INCARCERATED STUDENTS. ELIA. THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU -- OUR SERIES OF ACTIONS TAKEN BY BOTH HOUSES -- THAT SUPPORTS UP PROGRAMS IN HIGHER EDUCATION. THAT PROVIDE ASSISTANCE FOR STUDENTS WHO WERE FORMALLY INCARCERATED -- THESE PROGRAMS FOCUS BOTH ON PROVIDING. A SERVICES TO SPEAK TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HOPING TO ATTEND COLLEGE IN HELPING THEM IN THE APPLICATION PROCESS ALSO ONCE THEY ARRIVE ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS THEY PROVIDE IS A SERIES OF SERVICES TO HELP THE STUDENTS SUCCEED -- WHAT'S THERE AND ROLLED. THERE ARE THREE ISSUES -- WE THINK THAT YOU COULD CONSIDER AS YOU AS YOU WEIGH THE DIFFERENT HOUSES OPTIONS HERE -- THE FIRST -- AS WE WOULD NOTE THAT -- THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTED A GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR A CSU PROGRAM AND THEN PROVIDED MORE FUNDING IN ADDITION TO THAT. ON THE SENATE ALSO ADOPTED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR THE CSU PROGRAM BUT ALSO PROVIDED ONE TIME FUNDING. ACROSS THE THREE HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS FOR THEIR PROGRAMS SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT AS YOUR WINGS DIFFERENT APPROACHES A WHICH SEGMENT YOU'D LIKE TO DIRECT FUNDING TO AND WHEN WHETHER THERE'S A A WAY TO SORT OF A DIVIDE UP THAT FUNDING FOR EXAMPLE BASED ON ENROLLMENT. SECONDS WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE THE PURPOSE OF THE FUNDS COULD COULD DIFFER DEPENDING ON HOW THE PROGRAMS INTENDED USE THEIR EITHER ON GOING A ONE TIME FUNDING. ON SOME PROGRAMS COULD EXPAND THEIR SERVICES TO MORECAMPUSES WITHIN THEIR SYSTEM SO FOR EXAMPLE. ABOUT HALF OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE. DISTRICTS -- HAVE A A PROGRAM AND SO THAT THE DIGITAL FUNDING FOR SEIZE COMMUNITY COLLEGES COULD BE USED TO EXPAND TO MORE CAMPUSES. ALTERNATIVELY IF SOME K&lt;c.cyan&gt; SOME&lt;/c&gt; PROGRAMS MIGHT. TRY TO EXPAND MORE SERVICES AT THEIR EXISTING CAMPUSES AND SO THAT THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT PRIORITIES AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER WHICH OF THOSE MIGHT BE YOUR HIGHEST PRIORITY WITH THESE FUNDS. AND THEN THIRD WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE HOUSE IS DIFFERENT TERMS OF ON GOING IN ONE TIME FUNDING. OF THE SENATE PROVIDES ADDITIONAL ONE TIME FUNDING THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDES ONGOING FUNDING WE KNOW THAT BROADLY SPEAKING THESE PROGRAMS DO PROVIDE ONGOING SERVICES FOR STUDENTS INTRODUCED TO THE EXTENT YOU PROVIDE ONE TIME FUNDING. COULD CREATE COST PRESSURES IN FUTURE YEARS TO SUSTAIN THESE ACTIVITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU FINANCE HE ADMINISTRATION -- SUPPORTS THE GOALS OF PROJECT REBOUND INCLUDED FUNDING FOR THAT PURPOSE -- FOR THE OTHER ITEMS HERE -- THE MYSTERIES VOICE RIGHT NOW THEY DON'T FIT WITHIN OUR BUDGET FRAMEWORK IN PART FOR THE REASON THE LA -- MENTIONED ABOUT THAT MATCH BETWEEN ONE TIME AND ONGOING COSTS -- IS THERE ANY INTEREST IN I KNOW I'M LOOKING AT THE CAMPUSES THAT CURRENTLY ARE FUNDED UNDER PROJECT REBOUND AT NIGHT NO THIS ONE CAMPUS IN PARTICULAR IN IN THE LA COUNTY THAT'S NOT THERE. IS HOW DID THESE CAMPUSES COME TO BE. TO TO PARTICIPATE. RECORD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE ORIGINAL -- CAMPUS THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE PROGRAM WAS UC SAN FRAN. EXCUSE ME SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY I WHICH IS HOW TO PROGRAM SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES. AND IN TWENTY SIXTEEN EIGHT ADDITIONAL CAMPUSES OF THE CS% USE TWENTY THREE OPTED TO OUT ON ANY PLAN FOR ADDITIONAL EXPANSION. AT THE GOVERNOR'S OR THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL FOR ONE MILLION ON GOING IS INTENDED. TO BASICALLY TAKE THE PLACE OF PHILANTHROPIC GRANT FUNDS THAT ARE EXPIRING FOR THE PROGRAM IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE EXISTING BECAUSE PROGRAMS. THANK YOU THANK YOU OF THE THIRTY NIELSEN FELL BY THIRTY SKINNER. WHAT SORT OF MONITORING AND TRACKING AND REPORTING OF SUCCESS. I'M SYMPATHETIC BUT NOT WITHOUT. SOME BENCHMARKS. OF SUCCESS. THESE PROGRAMS. HOW WILL WE ACCOUNT FOR THE UNIVERSE OF THOSE PARTICIPATING HOW THEY ARE DOING AND TRANSITIONING? OF THE CSU HAVE CONDUCTED A SURVEY OF PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS FOR PROJECT REBOUND. OF THEIR MOST RECENT SURVEY HAD TO DO WITH -- WAS CONDUCTED IN FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THEY INDICATED IN THAT TIME THAT HE WERE EMPLOYED OR ENROLLED IN GRADUATE SCHOOL AFTER GRADUATING. AND THEY ALSO REPORTED THE RESULTS OF THAT SURVEY BEING THAT THEY HAD 0% RECIDIVISM RATE AFTER THREE YEARS FOR THAT COHORT OF GRADUATING STUDENTS AND WHAT ABOUT YOU SEE THE WE DON'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR -- INFORMATION AVAILABLE TODAY ON UNDERGROUND SCHOLARS BUT I I SUSPECT THAT THEY ARE HAVING POSITIVE RESULTS AS WELL. WELL THAT'S NOT SUFFICIENT OKAY YOU SEE. THE AS YOU GO THE LONG HIGHER UP THE EFFICACY AND SUCCESS AND THE NUMBERS. ARE GOING TO BE DIMINISHED YOU'RE GONNA HAVE GREATER PARTICIPATION IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS A TRANSITION. BUT YOU SHE SHOULD NOT BE EXEMPT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET REQUIRES YOU SEE TO REPORT. AND TRACK SUCCESS JUST LIKE CSU S.. WE CAN. DO THAT THEN I COULD HAVE SOME CONFIDENCE BUT JUST. TO JD YOU SEE WELL NOW JUST DO IT. NOW WE NEED TO HAVE SOME ACCOUNTING THIS IS A DELICATE AREA. COULD BE VERY HELPFUL. MANY INMATES HAVE HAD GREAT SUCCESS [inaudible] WITH THEIR PROGRAMS IN CUSTODY. BUT KEEP TRACK OF WHICH IS ONE OF THE GREAT DEFICIENCIES OF CORRECTIONS HISTORICALLY IN ALL PROGRAMMING. IS A FAILURE TO KEEP TRACK OF THE SUCCESS RATES. AND JUST THROW MORE MONEY AND MORE MONEY MORE MONEY. AND WE DID NOT SEE SUCCESSES HERE THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. BUT IT'S GOT TO BE DIRECTED TOWARD SUCCESS AND YOU'RE YOU'RE DEALING WITH A POPULATION THAT'S MORE CHALLENGE MORE DISADVANTAGED GOING IN TO THE COLLEGE LEVEL. REGIMENT. AND LEVELS OF WORK IS QUIET SO WE NEED TO KEEP TRACK OF THE ROLE OF A JUST A BIT TRY TO ANSWER MY COLLEAGUES. QUESTION ON REPORTING -- IT'S NOT APPARENT FROM THE MATERIAL. IN YOUR BINDER BUT THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ONE WITH RESPECT TO PROJECT REBOUND. APPROVED SOME OF REPORTING LANGUAGE FOR EXAMPLE THAT. REQUIRES REPORTING IN APRIL -- ONE TWENTY TWENTY THIS SAYS ON THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS FUNDING SOURCES AND TYPES OF PROGRAMS AT C. ISSUE CAMPUS IS USED TO SUPPORT FORMERLY INCARCERATED STUDENTS. NEXT HOW THE CAMPUS PROGRAMS COORDINATE WITH OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES IN THE VERY STATEWIDE AND LOCAL INITIATIVES FOR FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE. AND THE OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FUNDING SO THAT REPORTING LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT IS ON THE SENATE SIDE. WITH RESPECT TO PROJECT REDUNDANCY ISSUE. MADAM CHAIR IF I MAY. I JUST LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NO CONCERNS WITH THE SENATE'S PROPOSED REPORTING LANGUAGE FOR PROJECT RENOWNED. THANK YOU WITH SKINNER. THANK YOU --THIS. IS CLEARLY MONEY THAT IS WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS IN EDUCATION BECAUSE IT'S EDUCATION MONEY THOUGH THE IN OUR PUBLIC SAFETY -- BUDGET SUB FIVE WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF HEARINGS ON BOTH THE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS WITHIN OUR STATE PRISONS AND THE REENTRY PROGRAMS. AND WE ARE NOW AT THE PIECES IN THE SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE PRESENCE BY RCS USE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND A NUMBER OF UC'S. IN MANY MANY OF OUR STATE PRISONS. AND THE FACT THAT ARE DIFFERENT HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS ARE OFFERING COURSE WORK AT THE PRISON LEVEL. THEN HAS INCREASED THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHEN THEY LEAVE PRISON TO ENTER THOSE FACILITIES. AND WHAT AS HAS BEEN SORT OF NOTED OF COURSE SUCH A STUDENT DOES NEED SOME MORE SUPPORT THAN OTHER STUDENTS. AND THESE PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE -- THE CSU PROGRAM -- PROJECT RENOWNED WAS STARTED I BELIEVE IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE AND IT WAS PRIMARILY AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNTIL RECENTLY BUT NOW AS DIFFERENT CSU CAMPUSES HAVE EXPANDED IN THE STATE PRISONS IT MAKES THAT MUCH MORE SENSE -- FOR PROGRAMS LIKE PROJECT REBOUND TO ALSO EXPAND AT THE AT THEIR OWN STATE FACILITIES. SO I I WOULD ANTICIPATE NO I HOPE THAT WHAT PROJECT REBOUND HAS IN MIND IS TO DO SOMETHING SIMILAR AS TO WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM WHEN IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WHEN WE APPROVED THE FUNDING FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE OPENED UP A GRANT PROGRAM AND THE DIFFERENT COMMITTEE COLLEGE CAMPUSES THAT HAD EITHER STRONG PRESENCE IN THE PRISONS. FOR A GOOD NUMBER OF RE ENTRY FOLKS ALREADY ENROLLED THEN APPLIED FOR FUNDING TO BE ABLE -- TO IN OKAY AB MAKE THEIR SUPPORT. SERVICES ROBUST AND SO I NOTE THE CHEERS POINT THAT THERE'S FEWER CS USE THAN WE'D POTENTIALLY HOPE BUT I WOULD -- ANTICIPATE THAT WITH THIS IF WE WERE TO APPROVE. THE FUNDS THAT WE WOULD SEE AN EXPANSION OF CSU CAMPUSES THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE PROJECT REBOUND -- PROGRAM NO IN THE UC SYSTEM. THE UNDERGROUND SCHOLARS WE STARTED AT UC BERKELEY AND THAT PROGRAM NOT ONLY SUPPORTS THE STUDENTS WHO ARE REENTRY STUDENTS AT UC BUT ALSO SUPPORTS. THE X.. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH PROGRAMS AT BOTH CSU CAMPUSES AND OTHER UC'S. FIVE THERE ARE FEWER OF OUR FORMALLY INCARCERATED WHO ARE ATTENDING THE UC SYSTEM BUT INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH A NUMBER OF THEM HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL AND MANY ARE NOW IN PHD PROGRAMS. SO I CERTAINLY CAN -- ASK PROJECT -- RATHER UNDERGROUND SCHOLARS TO GIVE US SOME NUMBERS ON THE SUCCESS SO FAR. BUT OF WITH THE DIFF SMALL NUMBER THAT HAVE BEEN AT THE UC SYSTEM THAT THE INTERACTIONS I'VE SEEN IN REPORTS I'VE SEEN THAT THE SUCCESS RATE IS QUITE HIGH. BUT I THINK THIS -- THIS RELATIVELY MODEST EXPENDITURE IN THESE THREE SYSTEMS VERY MUCH COMPLIMENTS. THE BOTH THE EXPANDED REHABILITATION THAT WE'RE DOING WITHIN OUR STATE PRISON FACILITIES AND OUR FOCUS ON TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SUCCESSFUL REENTRY. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS MISS MCCARTY. YEAH THANK YOU YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WITH ALL THAT PROGRAMS AND EFFORTS FOR DOING CHANGING OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WE NEED MORE FOCUS ON RE ENTRY -- THAT'S WHY ALL THESE PROGRAMS ARE ARE WORTHY AND I WILL KNOW THAT THEY'RE ALL PRUDENT AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT WITH THAT. UC BERKELEY SCHOLARS BUT SPECIFICALLY PROJECT RIBBON AT I WILL NOTE WITH WITH A LOT OF TIME THAT HAPPENS IS PHILANTHROPY STARTS A PROGRAM. AND SEE IF IT WORKS AND THEN THE DENTIST THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE THERE FOREVER ITSELF IT'S A WORTHY PROGRAM TURN OVER TO THE GOVERNMENT TAKE WE TRY THIS IT'S PROVEN. AND THAT THE MILLION THAT'S IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WOULDN'T FIND PROJECT READ ON THEY HAVE TO CUT BACK AT SOME OF THOSE EIGHT CAMPUSES AND SO THIS TO SEE. THE ASSEMBLY ACTION WITH THE THREE POINT THREE ONGOING KEEPS THEM WHERE THEY'RE AT TODAY. AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IT THAT THE ONE MILLION I WOULD HAVE THAT HAVE TO CUT SOME OF THOSE THE CAMPUSES AND CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO GROW TO OTHER. ISSUES BUT AGAIN THIS ACTION JUST ONLY ALLOWS A DATE TO KEEP BROTHER AT TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WILL HOLD THAT ITEM OPEN MOVING ON TO ISSUE THIRTY SIX STILL NOT REACH. ELIA. THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU HERE ARE A SERIES OF ACTIONS TAKEN. BY THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR IN EACH OF THE HOUSES REGARDING -- HIGHER EDUCATION OUTREACH PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS AT A HIGH LEVEL OF PROVIDE SERVICES TO K. TWELVE STUDENTS WITH THE OVER ARCHING OBJECTIVE OF IMPROVING COLLEGE PARTICIPATION. I'M CONSIDERED AS ONE PACKAGE THE TWO HOUSES -- ARE VERY SIMILAR IN CLOSE IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING AMOUNTS TO THE A SENATE'S PROVIDING EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING IN THE ASSEMBLY IS PROVIDING TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING. TO THE ISSUE A CONFERENCE ARE REALLY ARE THE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS -- THAT WOULD BE WOULD RECEIVE THE FUNDING OTHER PROGRAMS ARE A MIX OF THE PROPOSALS THAT WERE MADE BY THE GOVERNOR AND ALSO SOME ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS. TO AMEND HOUSES DON'T HAVE ANY CROSSOVER IN TERMS OF THE PER PROGRAMS. IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING -- WHICH PROGRAMS TO FIND AND AND THIS ITEM OVERALL WE REACHED THREE ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION. FIRST WE WOULD NOTE THAT EACH PROGRAM HAS A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FOCUSES IN TERMS OF THE ACTIVITIES HE SUPPORTS A FOR EXAMPLE. SOME OUT REACH PROGRAM FOCUS MORE ON IMPROVING FINANCIAL AID AWARENESS OTHERS PROVIDE PEER MENTORING AND TUTORING AND SO YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER WHICH OF THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR YOU AND YOUR AND YOUR MAKING FINAL BUDGET DECISIONS. SECOND WE ALSO NOTE THAT SOME PROPOSALS HAVE A A CLOSER SERVE GEOGRAPHIC LINCOLN OR ARE LINKED TO SPECIFIC AREAS OF THE STATE OTHERS HAVE A MORE STATEWIDE FOCUS WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO TRY TO FIND WAYS TO TO MAXIMIZE THE FUNDING AND ADDRESS. A NEEDS ACROSS THE STATE. THIRD -- WE ALSO NOTE THAT -- SOME OF THE PROGRAMS ARE EXISTING PROGRAMS AND SOME OF THEM AREN'T OUR NEW INITIATIVES. AND A ONE OPTION FOR YOU IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING WHICH INITIATIVE DEFINED AS TO AS TO FOCUS ON INITIATIVES THAT OUR LONG STANDING AND HAVE A PROVEN TRACK RECORD. THAT MIGHT GIVE YOU SOME MORE CONFERENCE AS TO HOW THE FUND TO BE SPENT IN THE KIND OF OUTCOMES YOU MIGHT EXPECT TO SEE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I WOULD NOTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTS THE ASSEMBLIES ACTIONS AND APPROVING OUR PROPOSALS ON THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT SUCCESS AWARENESS INITIATIVE. AS WELL AS THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION STUDENT LOAN OUR REGION IT SHOULD HAVE. WE ALSO SUPPORT THE SENATE ACTION IN APPROVING THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL FOR THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. TO ADMINISTER INNOVATION GRANTS TARGETED FOR THE SAN JOAQUIN AN INLAND EMPIRE REGIONS OF THE STATE QUESTION. MEMBERS THREE MARLA. MA'AM CHURCH SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE TWO INITIATIVES GOING ON ONE IS TO PROVIDE FREE. COLLEGE AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. LEVEL ONE AND NOW HERE WE'RE TRYING TO MAYBE ASSIST. IN EDUCATING THEM ON HOW TO FINANCE. EDUCATION SO I'M. JUST CURIOUS MAYBE IN FIFTY WORDS OR LESS WHAT IS A STUDENT SUCCESS AWARENESS TEAM. CERTAINLY I THINK THE THE STUDENT SUCCESS AWARENESS INITIATIVE AT THE THAT WOULD BE HOUSED AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE RESOURCES AND MATERIALS TO THE COLLEGES. TO A MESSAGE TO STUDENTS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM -- STUDENT SUCCESS INITIATIVES THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND OUT THERE TO STUDENTS AS WELL AS PROVIDE SOME PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. OPPORTUNITIES TO FACULTY -- TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THE PROBLEMS FRAMEWORK -- ESTABLISHES COLLEGE GOING CULTURES AND REALLY HELPS -- STUDENTS SUCCEED. THAT THE TEAM IN IN MANY RESPECTS IS REFERRING -- TO THE ACTUAL PROVISION OF OUT REACH AND MATERIALS TO COLLEGES AS OPPOSED TO A SPECIFIC TEAM OF INDIVIDUALS. FOR YOU'VE IDENTIFIED THAT THIS IS LACKING. I THINK WE'VE IDENTIFIED THAT THERE IS A GOD THAT IT IS A POSITIVE THING TO PROVIDE. THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION OUT REACH TO COLLEGES AND ULTIMATELY TO STUDENTS TO HELP THEM. BE SUCCESSFUL -- IN THEIR COMMUNITY COLLEGE ENDEAVORS. THIS IS A ONE TIME. THAT'S CORRECT I THINK. THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE. VERY AWARE D. A. B. -- NINETEEN YEAH I HAVE EXEMPTIONS ARE TUITION EXEMPTIONS CAME TO BE IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR SO THIS REALLY IS THE FIRST YEAR OF THE PROGRAM -- IT IS A NEW PROGRAM IN THAT RESPECT SO WE'RE WE'RE DEVELOPING SOME MATERIALS AND PROVIDING SOME OUT REACH. TO SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM THANK. Q. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS [inaudible] WITH MAYES. TALK A BIT ABOUT THE THE INNOVATION GRANTS AND AND WHY SAN JOAQUIN IN INLAND EMPIRE -- IF YOU HAVEN'T REALIZED MUST THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE. BIASED -- TOWARDS THE INLAND EMPIRE -- BUT WHAT WE'LL. TALK ABOUT THE INNOVATION GRANTS. SERVICE PROPOSAL IS TARGETED FOR THE SAN JOAQUIN INLAND EMPIRE REGIONS OF THE STATE FOR A FEW REASONS -- PRIMARILY WE'VE IDENTIFIED THOSE AREAS AS AREAS THAT ARE PARTICULARLY DESERVING AT THIS POINT IN TIME OF SOME ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT FOR INNOVATIVE APPROACHES. IN MULTI SEGMENTAL EDUCATION FROM BOTH KINDERGARTEN ALL THE WAY THROUGH A UNIVERSITY LEVEL. AND SAN JOAQUIN AND ONE INLAND EMPIRE IN PARTICULAR. BOTH OF THOSE AREAS HAVE LOWER PER CAPITA AVERAGE INCOME COMPARED TO THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE HIGHER RATES OF UNEMPLOYMENT COMPARED TO THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE AND ALSO LOWER RATES OF UC AND CSU ELIGIBILITY DESPITE HAVING. A LARGER NUMBER OR INCREASING NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES IN THE REGIONS FOR THOSE REASONS AT THIS PROPOSAL IS TARGETED. AT AWARDING GRANTS TO EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WHERE THERE K. TWELVE OR HIGHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN THOSE TWO REGIONS. I GUESS I'M JUST TRYING TO TO TO THINK OF WHY WHY WE WOULDN'T WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT I THINK WE'VE ALL KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME WITHIN THOSE TWO COUNTIES UP THROUGH THE CENTRAL VALLEY EVEN IN THE NORTH STATE. AND THOSE ARE AREAS THAT ARE -- DISADVANTAGED WE OFTEN FEEL -- LIKE WE DON'T GET OUR FAIR SHARE -- AND IT'S ESPECIALLY WE'RE TALK ABOUT OPPORTUNITY BOB AND SO IT SEEMED TO ME APPROPRIATE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT. A SUPPORT THAT EFFORT. I MEAN TO SUPPORT THE SENATE ACTION OKAY THANK YOU MISTER KING. QUESTION SO JUST -- TO TO FIND AT THE THINK THE REASON WE ENDED UP BRIDGE ACTING IT AND MOVING -- THE MONEY TO CAL SO BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT THAT KELSO PROGRAM SINCE IT HAD ALREADY BEEN UP AND RUNNING RATHER THAN HAVING A BRAND NEW PROGRAM. NEW -- HAVEN'T TO SET UP NEW ADMINISTRATION ON A PARTICULAR REGION HALF THE MONEY GO INTO AN EXISTING PROGRAM THAT SEEM TO HAVE SUCCESS OR JUST WANT UNDERSTAND WHY. WHY NOT INVEST IN THE CURRENT PROGRAM INDOORS IF YOU KNOW WHAT THE COMPROMISE OF ONE OR? TWO WHEN I GET RID OF IT. WHY HAVE A WHOLE NEW? PROGRAM WHEN YOU HAVE AN EXISTING PROGRAM THAT'S CHARGED WITH DOING THIS. WE DEFINITELY RECOGNIZE THE VALUE IN THE CAL SO PROGRAM IN THE EXISTING SORT OF CONSORTIUM BASED PROGRAMMING EFFORTS THAT THAT PROGRAM PROVIDES. HOWEVER THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL IS MORE TARGETED TO SPECIFICALLY TO THE SAN JOAQUIN IN INLAND EMPIRE REGIONS OF THE STATE. BECAUSE WE HAD IDENTIFIED THOSE AS AREAS THAT PARTICULARLY NEEDED SOME ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT. AND I WOULD I WOULD JUST ADD THAT ON THE INNOVATION GRANT CITED ISN'T JUST FOCUSED ON OUT REACH THAT'S INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES TO HELP WITH STUDENT SUCCESS WITH CREATING. COLLEGE GOING CULTURES WITH FOCUSING ON THIS TWO GENERATIONS STRATEGY -- THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PUT FORWARD WHICH IS HOW CAN WE HELP THE STUDENTS OF TODAY AND ALSO HELP THE STUDENTS OF TOMORROW THAT ARE THEIR CHILDREN. AND AND AND THAT'S GREAT BUT I GUESS WHY NOT JUST PASSED THE EXISTING. PROGRAM TO GO DO THAT THEN. SET UP A WHOLE NEW STRIPPER SAYS THAT THE HOME TO STRUCTURE AND FRAMEWORK TO DO IT WHEN WE DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE SUCCESSFUL. SHOULD I I WOULD GO BACK. TO THE CURRENT KELSO PROGRAM IS FOCUSED ON STUDENT OUTREACH WEARS A THINK WERE WERE FOCUSED ON A MORE BROAD STRATEGY THAT INCLUDES THIS TO GENERATION STRATEGY -- SO IT'S NOT JUST TARGETED TOWARD OUTREACH. NO UNDERSTOOD BUT THEN WHY NOT JUST ASK COUNSEL TO EXPAND THEIR SCOPE BECAUSE YOU'RE ASKING. PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T COME FORWARD IT. TO DO SOMETHING THEY DON'T NECESSARILY. DO OR WE DON'T KNOW. EVEN ACCESS. SO I I THINK. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY KELSO PASSAGE ITS FOCUS TODAY AND I THINK -- WE WERE ATTEMPTING TO FOCUS ON TWO SPECIFIC REGIONS OF THE STATUS AS OPPOSED TO THOSE BROAD FIFTEEN CONSORTIUM THAT ARE THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO WE WERE DEFINITELY MUCH MORE TARGETED IN OUR APPROACH -- BUT CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE GOD YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM. THE COUNTRY JUST ASK HOUSE UP. TO TARGET AS WELL. ANYTIME WE TARGET SOMETHING WE NEED TO CREATE SOMETHING NEW OR COULD WE ACCESS PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR A WHILE. TO FOCUS A LITTLE BIT. CHAU. I THINK IN MANY RESPECTS YOU HAVE YOUR KELSO PROGRAM AND WE WOULD HAVE THIS INNOVATION GRANT PROGRAM -- ULTIMATELY THE INNOVATION GRANTS ARE ALSO OPERATED BY A OUR EXISTING INSTITUTIONS AS WELL SO WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT PARTNERSHIPS WITH YOU SEE CSU. OCCUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES YOUR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS SO IT IN MANY RESPECTS WERE ALSO SUPPORTING THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE -- THROUGH THIS PROGRAM. THANK YOU SENATOR A THE THING ABOUT DRUGS AND JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT WHILE I'M. AMBIVALENT WITH RESPECT TO NEW PROGRAM VERSUS KELSO BY I WOULD NOTE FOR THE RECORD THAT -- IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OR THE INLAND EMPIRE OF WAS LEFT ON THE TRAIN STATION PLATFORM AND TRAIN PULLED OUT I DON'T SEE INLAND EMPIRE IN THE KELSO PROGRAM SO. WE CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS. TO IT WOULD SEEM TO ME FOR THOSE OF US WHO COME FROM THAT AREA OF FIFTH CAL SOAP IS THE FINAL DESTINATION FOR THIS. THIS FUNDING. THANK MANAGER THANK YOU ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS [inaudible] THIS OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I I AGREE -- I THINK PART OF THE REASON FOR JUSTIFYING THIS FUNDING IS THAT. THESE ARE A COUPLE REASON THE STATE THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND. AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS I THINK IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE PROCESS DIRECT OUR RESOURCES IN THAT DIRECTION SO REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT WE INSTITUTE NEW PROGRAM USE EXISTING PROGRAM I THINK IT'S ABOUT ON US TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT MONEY GOES TO WHERE IT'S MOST NEEDED. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER COMMENTS. WILL HOLD THAT ITEM OPEN. LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE THIRTY SEVEN CAL GRANTS COMPETITIVE SUMMER AND ACCESS AWARDS ALEJO. THANK YOU THE STICKING WITH THE LA L.. THIS ISSUE COVER SEVERAL ACTIONS RELATED TO THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM. BOTH HOUSES REJECTED THE GOVERNOR'S NINETY SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL TO STUDENTS PARENTS. AND INSTEAD REDIRECTED THE FUNDS TOWARD OTHER CONTENT PRIORITIES. THE SENATE BUT MOST OF THESE FUNDS BETWEEN TWO MAJOR ACTIONS. ONE OF THOSE ACTIONS EXPAND THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE AWARDS WHICH ARE TYPICALLY AVAILABLE TO OLDER STUDENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM. THE OTHER ACTION WOULD EXPAND THE SIZE OF THE AXIS. WHICH IS AVAILABLE TO LOWER INCOME CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS TO ASSIST WITH THE LIVING COSTS. ASSEMBLY IN CONTRAST PRIMARILY RETRACTED THE FUNDS TOWARD INCREASING THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE AWARDS. THE BY A LARGER AMOUNT. IT ALSO DOCTORTRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD PRIORITIZE STUDENT PARENTS FOR THOSE AWARDS. FINALLY BOTH HOUSES A DOCTOR POLICY CHANGE THAT WOULD MAKE STUDENTS ELIGIBLE FOR CAL GRANTS DURING THE SUMMER. WITHOUT THIS COMING TOWARD THE MAXIMUM TIME LIMIT FOR RECEIVING AID. THE BIGGEST DECISION BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY IS HOW TO DISTRIBUTE THE AVAILABLE FUNDS BETWEEN PROVIDING MORE APPLICANTS WITH AWARDS TO THE COMPETITIVE PROGRAM. AND INCREASING THE SIZE OF THOSE AWARDS THROUGH THE ACCESS COMPONENT. BOTH OF THESE AUGMENTATIONS ARE REASONABLE. AS MANY OF YOU NOTE REGARDING THE COMPETITIVE AWARD PROGRAM THERE ARE ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS EACH YEAR FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AVAILABLE WORDS. SUGGESTING THAT THERE IS A LARGE AMOUNT OF ON THAT DEMAND FOR THIS PROGRAM. AS FOR THE ACCESS OR TO MOUNT THE CURRENT AWARD OF ABOUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR COVERS A RELATIVELY SMALL SHARE OF STUDENTS LIVING COSTS. CONSIDERATION WE WOULD RAISES LEGISLATURE WAYS THESE TWO POSSIBLE ACTIONS IS THAT THEY DO HAVE DIFFERENT FISCAL IMPLICATIONS IN THE OUT YEARS. ADDING COMPETITIVE AWARDS IS ACTION THAT WAY IT SIMPLY PHASE AND OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL YEARS AS NEW AWARDS CONVERT TO RENEWALS. SO THAT THE COST OF FULL IMPLEMENTATION COULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN IT IS IN YOUR ONE IN CONTRAST INCREASING THE SIZE OF THE AXIS AWARD WOULD ESSENTIALLY TAKE FULL EFFECT IN YOUR ONE THAT'S GENERATING. SOME LESS COST PRESSURE IN THE OUT YEARS [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU FINANCE. I MAKE THREE POINTS THE FIRST IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION GENERALLY -- IS SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT OF INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PORTS AND THAT IS WHY THE GOVERNOR INCLUDED AN INCREASE AND THOSE COMPETITIVE AWARDS IN HIS GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND MAY REVISION. THE SECOND POINT -- IS IT IS A REAL PRIORITY FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION TO FOCUS ON A TWO GENERATION APPROACH AND BREAK THE CYCLE OF POVERTY AND MAKING SURE THAT BY INVESTING IN STUDENTS WHO ARE PARENTS WE HELP THOSE STUDENTS WERE IN SCHOOL AND WE HELP THEIR KIDS AND SO THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. ESPECIALLY IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE MANY PEOPLE DO NOT RECOGNIZE THAT ALMOST A QUARTER OF ALL COLLEGE STUDENTS WHEN YOU LOOK BETWEEN TWO AND FOUR YEAR COLLEGES. OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE ALSO PERRANCE AND SO WE THOUGHT -- IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE THIS TO GENERATION APPROACH AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING A LOT OF RESOURCES IN A WAY THAT CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE BEHAVIOR. AND HELPS IN PERRANCE BREAK OUT OF THAT CYCLE POVERTY AND CREATE A BETTER FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR KIDS. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THESE FAMILIES DEPENDING ON THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR UP. TO SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS IN EIGHTY THREE THE PROGRAM AND WE THINK THAT TYPE OF RESOURCES IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ACHIEVING THE GOVERNOR'S GOALS AND WE HOPE THAT THEY WILL BE GIVEN DUE CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU MEMBERS [inaudible] SENATOR ROBB. WELL ONE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT. TO ENTERED INTO THE SENATE'S PROPOSAL HERE OUT OF BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER ONE WAS THE STATISTICS THAT WE WERE PROVIDED THAT INDICATES THAT OUT OF SIXTY TWO THOUSAND STUDENT PARENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A NEW COMPETITIVE AWARD. FORTY FOUR THOUSAND DID NOT RECEIVE. ONE AND SO IT OCCURRED TO US IF WE TOOK THAT MONEY AND WE BUMPED UP THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE GRANT AWARDS WE MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE A MAKE A BIGGER IMPACT HAVE HAVE. GET MORE BANG FOR OUR BUCK SO TO SPEAK AND AND ACTUALLY PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES TO STUDENT PARENTS TO ALLOW THEM. TO DISSIPATING COMPLETE. TO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. I'LL JUST BRIEFLY COMMENT AND THEN LET MY COLLEAGUES WEIGH IN AS WELL I THINK IF YOU DO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE AWARDS -- YOU CERTAINLY WOULD REACH SOME STUDENT PARENTS AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES I THINK THE ISSUE IS THAT THAT RESOURCES ONE SPECIFICALLY BE DIRECTED AT THEM YOU'RE HELPING A BROADER RANGE OF PEOPLE ALL OF WHOM MAY BE DESERVING OF HELP IN SOME WAY. UP BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY GETS THAT FCUS OF HELPING STUDENTS PARENTS DIRECTLY THROUGH THIS PROGRAM. YEAH I WOULD I WON'T ADD MUCH MORE BUT I WOULD JUST SAY THE WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO STEPPED VERSUS BREATH SO WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THE WE WENT ON A A DEEPER VERY. DIED TARGETED APPROACH WHERE'S THERE'S A A BROADER APPROACH OF SERVING MORE STUDENTS WITH THE LOWER WORK. BUT OF COURSE THE UNFORTUNATE THING IS WHEN YOU'RE. TALKING ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PLUS -- APPLICANTS FOR A PROGRAM WHETHER IT'S GOT FORTY THOUSAND OR THIRTY THOUSAND OR FIFTY THOUSAND THE UNFORTUNATE THING IS WE'RE NOT REALLY -- CURRENTLY DOING THE JOB WE NEED TO DO. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE AID TO FOLKS TO GET INTO SCHOOL GET CREDENTIAL THEY NEED AND AND GET BACK OUT AND GET A JOB AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE THIS THING OUT BECAUSE WE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY AND A LOT OF TIME AND AND ATTENTION ON CREW. TECH EDUCATION AND JOB SKILLS TRAINING. WERE MOSTLY TALKING ABOUT THOSE FOLKS. I THINK IT'S A FAIR STATEMENT WHO DON'T MOVE IMMEDIATELY INTO SCHOOL FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND SO IF THERE ARE TWO OR THREE YEARS. THEY THEY DON'T QUALIFY FOR THE CAL GRANT ENTITLEMENT THEY HAVE TO COMPETE IN THE COMPETITIVE POOL -- AND THAT'S REALLY THE PROBLEM WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO CUT IT BUMP UP THESE COMPETITIVE GRANTS. TO SOMETHING MORE THAN. THIRTY THOUSAND OR EVEN FORTY THOUSAND OR FIFTY THOUSAND THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS WITH MCCARTY. THANK YOU. BEFORE I GET INTO IT THE PURPLES LIFE I THINK ALL THREE RECOGNIZE THAT. LUCK TODAY COLLEGES MUCH MORE THAN TUITION AND SO THOSE ARE THE ISSUES IS IT'S OTHER COSTS AND SO. RECOGNIZE PROPOSAL -- OUT FROM THE GOVERNOR AS WELL AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WITH THE SUMMER SCHOOL TO HELP STUDENTS. GRADUATE -- WITH IN A TIMELY -- PERIOD SO THOSE ARE ALL POSITIVE I THINK JUST TO ADD ON TO WHAT -- SENATOR A ROTH MENTIONED WE WE FELT AS WELL THE SENATE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY HELP MORE PARENTS MORE STUDENT PARENTS BY. FINDING THE AMOUNT OF COMPOUND WORDS BECAUSE SOME OF THE STUDENTS WHO FRANKLY APPLY IN THE COMPETITIVE POT. OUR PARENTS OLDER STUDENTS COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS MORE LIKELY TO BE PARENTS IN IN. IN THE IN THE ASSEMBLY PLAN WE ACTUALLY HAVE -- ADDITIONAL POINTS TO TO GET TO YOUR ISSUE FOR FINANCE. TO RECOGNIZE COMPETITORS STUDENTS WHO ARE PARENTS TILT TO FOCUS ON THE PREMISE THAT YOU HAVE TO INCORPORATE THAT. IN THE PROPOSAL WHICH I THINK IS WORTHY SO IT COMES DOWN TO THIS I THINK THAT. NOT WITHSTANDING THAT OUT YOUR COSTS WHEN YOU DO THAT THE RENEWALS FOR COMPETITIVE. THAT THE THE ACCESS AWARDS WHICH THE SENATE ONES WHICH IS I DON'T WANT TO DIMINISH ACCENT REALLY FOCUS ON THE NON TUITION COSTS. IS YOU KNOW ROUGHLY A HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT BUCKS AN ADDITIONAL WORK PER STUDENT. VERSES GIVING ANOTHER TWENTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO DIDN'T WIN THAT CAL GRANT LOTTERY A CHANCE AND SO. RIGHT NOW YOUR ODDS ARE -- REALLY LONG AND SO YOU KNOW WITH THIS THERE WOULD GO TO ONE OF FOUR SO. DRAMATICALLY INCREASES THE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEONE TO GET THE BIG AWARD AND FOCUS. ON CALLS AND SO I THINK THAT'S HOW WE SHOULD PROBABLY FRAME THE ISSUE. THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY FURTHER COMMENTS. IT WILL BE THE ITEM OPEN MOVING ON CAL GRANTS FOR AB FIFTY FOUR STUDENTS ISSUE THIRTY EIGHT L. L. [inaudible] THANK YOU. THIS IS AN ASSEMBLY PRIORITY AND IT COVERS SEVERAL ACTIONS RELATED TO FINANCIAL AID FOR AB FIVE FORTY STUDENTS. AB FIVE FORTY STUDENTS INCLUDING UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS WHO ATTEND THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL OR COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS. ARE EXEMPT FROM NON RESIDENT TUITION CHARGES THAT YOU SEE CSU COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE STUDENTS ARE ALSO GENERALLY ELIGIBLE FOR STATE FINANCIAL AID EXCEPT THEY ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAM THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING. IN ADDITION AB FIVE FORTY STUDENTS WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL AID INCLUDING PELL GRANTS FEDERAL LANDS IN FEDERAL WORK STUDY. ASSEMBLY TOOK THREE ACTIONS RELATED TO THIS ISSUE. FIRST TO CATER TO SERVICE INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT WOULD PROVIDE A WAY TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER SEMESTER. UP TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS WHO COMPLETED REQUIRED SUBCOMMITTEE SERVICE REQUIREMENT. ASSEMBLY SUGGESTED THIS IS INTENDED TO REPLACE THE INCOME A STUDENT CURRENT THROUGH THE FEDERAL WORK STUDY PROGRAM. SECOND THE ASSEMBLY ALSO DOCTOR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD MAKE AB FIVE FORTY STUDENTS ELIGIBLE FOR COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT AWARDS. AND THIRTY ASSEMBLY ADOPTED PLACEHOLDER LANGUAGE THAT WOULD AMEND AB FIVE FORTY SO THAT STUDENTS WHO ATTEND THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL FOR TWO YEARS RATHER THAN THREE YEARS. WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR RESIDENT TUITION AND STATE FINANCIAL AID. WELL THIS LAST ELIGIBILITY CHANGES LANGUAGE ONLY CHANGE WHEN A THREE COULD HAVE SOME FISCAL IMPACT RELATED TO INCREASE STATE FINANCIALLY IT COSTS AND FORGOTTEN ON RESIDENT TUITION AVENUE. THANK YOU. GREAT SEEING ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS. ITEM. WILL MAKE ONE COMMENT FROM FINANCES -- WHICH IS THAT ON THE ASSEMBLY IS PROPOSAL TO EXTEND -- AB FIVE FORTY ELIGIBILITY FOR COMPETITIVE CAL GRANTS THE ADMINISTRATION DOES SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLY IS A PROPOSAL OVER THERE ON THE OTHER ITEMS THE ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT SUPPORT THEM AT THIS TIME FOR COST REASONS [inaudible] NUMBER QUESTION. I JUST WANNA DO ONE QUICK PLUG -- IN REGARDS -- TO THIS PARTICULAR ITEM IT IS GERMANE -- BUT BUT NOT ADDRESS HERE IN THIS BUDGET ITEM -- THERE IS A BIT O AN INEQUITY -- WE'VE PROVIDED THROUGH AB FIVE FOURTEEN OTHER PROGRAMS FOR UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN HERE IN THE U. S. -- FOR THIRD IN OUR HIGH SCHOOL FOR THREE YEARS BUT WE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY ASSISTANCE IN FACT -- IT'S A PROBLEM GOING TO CAL STATE OR YOU SEE FOR THOSE DOCUMENTED STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN HERE FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS -- AND THERE'S A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF THEM BUT I DO THINK THAT SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE FIXED WE PROVIDE FOR THOSE THAT ARE UNDOCUMENTED BUT THOSE. WHO'VE BEEN HERE THAT ARE DOCUMENTED PARENTS CAME OVER ON A LEGAL VISA AND WE DO NOT PROVIDE FOR AND THEY END UP HAVING TO PAY OUT OF STATE TUITION SO WITH SOMETHING I THINK WE'VE GOT A FIX IN THE FUTURE. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ISSUE THIRTY NINE CHILD SAVINGS ACCOUNTS [inaudible] HELLO. THIS ISSUE COVERS ACTIONS RELATED TO COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS FOR CHILDREN. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME TO CREATE A NEW INITIATIVE THAT WOULD PROVIDE GRANTS TO LOCAL ENTITIES IN SUPPORT OF CHILD SAVINGS ACCOUNT PROGRAMS. THE SENATE REJECTED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT REDIRECTED TWENTY MILLION OF THE FUNDS TOWARD A SIMILAR EXISTING INITIATIVE CALLED EVERY KID COUNTS. THE ASSEMBLY ON THE OTHER HAND ADOPTED TWENTY FIVE MILLION OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. IT ALSO ADOPTED INITIAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME TO CONTINUE STATEWIDE INITIATIVE THAT WOULD DEPOSIT FUNDS INTO COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNT. FOR EVERY NEW BORN. LEGISLATURE WAYS VARIOUS APPROACHES TO EXPANDING PARTICIPATION COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS. WE WOULD RAISE JUST A COUPLE OF ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION. ONE ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS. THE STATE'S EXISTING COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNT PROGRAM EVERY KID COUNTS HAS ONLY BEEN OPEN THUS FAR TO ENTITIES THAT HAVE EXISTING CHILD SAVINGS PROGRAMS. WHICH TEND TO BE CONCENTRATED WITHIN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE STATE. IF THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES TO FIND MORE LOCAL GRANT THAT MAY WISH TO MAKE SOME OF THESE GRANTS AVAILABLE TO SEE TAUGHT SAVINGS PROGRAMS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. FOR THE BENEFIT THE MORE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED. A STATEWIDE APPROACH WOULD BY DESIGN ADDRESS THIS CONCERN ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION. THE OTHER CONSIDERATION WOULD RATE HAS TO DO WITH TARGETING THE FUNDS. SIX CHILDREN FROM LOWER INCOME FAMILIES ARE CURRENTLY LESS LIKELY TO HAVE COLLEGE SAVINGS LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO TARGET CALCIUM'S INITIATIVES TOWARD THE FIGHT AGAINST. FOR EXAMPLE IF IT CHOOSES TO FIND MORE LOCAL GRANTS THAT COULD PRIORITIZE GRANTS TO AREAS THAT SERVE HIGHER POPULATIONS OF LOWER INCOME STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. IF ON THE OTHER HAND IT TO THE STATE WIDE APPROACH IN MAY WISH TO SEND AND CONCEALING FOR RECEIVING CERTAIN BENEFITS SUCH AS MATCHING INCENTIVES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FINANCE TWO POINTS FIRST THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS THE RIGHT LEVEL -- FOR BEGINNING THIS PROGRAM AND THE SECOND IS THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT THE EMPHASIS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE LOCAL REGIONS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE AND HOW TO DESIGN PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE REACHING STUDENTS IN THOSE AREAS -- AND IN PARTICULAR MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE NOT ONLY SERVING EXISTING PROGRAMS BUT HELPING SEAT NEW PROGRAMS IN AREAS OF THE START STATE THAT AREN'T SERVED YET. THANK YOU QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS MR MCCARTY YEAH AT NIGHT WE OBVIOUSLY THINK THIS IS A GREAT EFFORT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT STUDENTS IF THEY HAVE. FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR NAME FOR COLLEGE YOU'RE STILL EQUALLY MUCH MORE LIKELY TO GO TO COLLEGE LIKE. SEVEN EIGHT TWO ONE I WILL NOT YOUR POINT RIGHT HERE JUST YESTERDAY. OUR MAYOR FORMER LEADER HERE THE SENATE PROPOSED A BUDGET FOR THE CITY. WHICH HAS SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO AUGMENT THEIR EVERY KID CAL'S A WORD THAT WE THEY RECEIVED THIS YEAR FROM OUR PREPARATION TWO YEARS AGO AND THAT WAS THE WHOLE IDEA IS TO SEE THESE LOCAL PROGRAMS AND INSPIRE THEM. TO STEP IT UP. AND SOMETHING THAT -- CERTAINLY I'D WORK ON HERE LOCALLY WITH OUR WITH OUR LOCALS AND SACKED AND IN WEST SACK AND SO. WE'RE SEEING IT COME TO FRUITION RIGHT HERE THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER MOORE LÃ . THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST APOLOGIZE FOR NOT UNDERSTANDING THIS PROGRAM ARE WE RESIST FIFTY MILLION TO MARKET [inaudible] AND PROMOTE [inaudible] OR WE SIGN IN. YOUR MARKET ACCOUNTS FOR OUR STUDENTS IT'S PRIMARILY IN THAT SENSE OF GRANTS DIRECTLY FIRST THAT MONEY WOULD GO TO STUDENTS ACCOUNTS BUT IN TERMS OF HOW IT'S SET UP IT'S DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE. MATCHING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO THAT IT'S NOT SIMPLY THE STATE FUNDING THESE ACCOUNTS BACK TO ASSEMBLY MEMBERS POINT MAKING SURE THAT DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE STEPPING UP TO HELP BEGIN THESE PROGRAMS. SO THEN WOOD THE STATE PUT. SOME AMOUNT OF MONEY INTO A STUDENTS ACCOUNT IN THE IN THE IN THE STATE MONITORS THAT. WHILE THEY PROGRESS TOWARDS COLLEGE SAID THIS IS ONE TIME FUNDING SO IT'S REALLY DESIGNED AROUND SUPPORTING NEW PROGRAMS -- THAT ARE STARTING UP IN THESE DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE. I JUST HAD THAT THE LANGUAGE IS THE IS REALLY DESIGNED AROUND TRYING TO GET AT A MINIMUM OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS DEPOSITED INTO THAT STREETS ACCOUNT. FOR GRANT RECIPIENTS. CAN HELP TO MORE RESEARCH THANK YOU CAPTURE. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU. ISSUE FORTY TEACHER RECRUITMENT AND PREPARATION ELIO. BOTH HOUSES PROVIDE ROUGHLY NINETY MILLION DOLLARS TO ADDRESS TEACHER SHORTAGES BUT THE TO TAKE DIFFERENT APPROACHES. THE MAN ACTION IN THE SENATE WAS TO ADOPT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE LOAN REPAYMENT TO TEACHERS. WITH MODIFICATIONS INCLUDING ONE THAT WOULD REQUIRE RECIPIENTS OF THE LOAN REPAYMENT TO WORK IN SCHOOLS FACING TEACHER SHORTAGES. THESE ON THE OTHER HAND REJECTED THE GOVERNOR'S LET ME PAYMENT PROPOSAL AND INSTEAD REDIRECTED THE FUNDS TOWARD SCHOLARSHIPS THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE AS UP FRONT AID. TO STUDENTS PURSUING TEACHER CREDENTIALS IN CERTAIN SUBJECT AREAS. TO QUALIFY FOR THE STATE STUDENTS WOULD NEED TO COMMIT TO WORKING IN THE SUBJECT AREAS FOR FOUR YEARS. FOR REPAIR THEIR FUNDS. THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IN THE TWO HOUSES APPROACHES AS A MATTER OF TIMING WHETHER THE AID IS AVAILABLE TO TEACHERS WHILE THEY'RE STILL PURSUING THEIR CONVENTIONAL AS A SCHOLARSHIP. OR AFTER THEY COMPLETED THEIR CREDENTIAL. AS THEIR COMPLETING THE WORK REQUIREMENTS. RAISE A COUPLE OF CONSIDERATION. ON ONE HAND A PRINT SCHOLARSHIPS COULD SERVICE STRONG INCENTIVES FOR STUDENTS TO PURSUE CERTAIN KERR POTS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE BECAUSE SOME STUDENTS MAY BE AVERSE TO TAKING OUT LOANS. ON THE OTHER HAND IT MAY BE WORTH NOTING THAT UP FRONT SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM COULD HAVE HIRED MINISTRY OF COSTS AS STUDENTS WOULD RECEIVE AID BEFORE THEY COMPLETE THE REQUIRED WORK. AND THE ADMINISTERING AGENCY MAY NEED TO TRACK THE STUDENTS AS THEY COMPLETE THE REQUIREMENTS AND COLLECT THREE PAYMENTS FROM THE STUDENTS IF THEY DO NOT COMPLETE AS REQUIREMENTS. WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES TO OFFER THE STATE AS AN UP FRONT SCHOLARSHIP OR LOAN REPAYMENT WE KNOW THAT IT DOES HAVE OPTIONS TO TARGET THE FUNDS TOWARD AREAS OF GREATEST NEED. AND ASSEMBLIES PROPOSAL FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A REQUIREMENT THAT PRESENTS TEACH IN CERTAIN SUBJECT AREAS FACING CHARGES SUCH AS SCIENCE MATH AND SPECIAL EDUCATION. THE SENATE'S PROPOSAL AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED AS A REQUIREMENT THAT TEACHERS WORK IN SCHOOLS FACING SHORTAGES. THE LEGISLATURE MAVEN MUST CONSIDER COMBINING THESE CRITERIA SAID THAT THE FUNDS GO TO TEACHERS WORKING IN SHORT SUBJECT AREAS WITHIN HIGH NEED SCHOOLS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FINANCE WILL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES. CERTAINLY I TEMPORE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF BOTH HOUSES INVESTMENT IN THIS AREA -- BUT ULTIMATELY I THINK THE ONE IMPORTANT ASPECT FROM THE LANGUAGE TEN POINT FOR US IS THAT WE HAVE SOME ASPECT OF THE EMERGENCY CREDENTIAL UP FOCUS IN OUR SCHOOLS FOR THE WERE ALSO TARGETING TOWARD THAT ASPECT. I THINK WERE OPEN TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON EXACTLY WHAT THAT LANGUAGE LOOKS LIKE WHAT THEIR TOP FRONT WAR ON THE BACKEND BUT CERTAINLY WE'D LIKE THAT ONE FOCUS ON EMERGENCY CREDENTIALS INCLUDED. THANK YOU QUESTIONS SENATOR SKINNER FOLLOWED BY MORE LOT. TOM THIS THIS IS ONE OF THOSE -- I DON'T KNOW IF I'D WANT TO CALL IT QUANDARY BUT ON THE ONE HAND. GIVEN THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA IN TEACHER SALARIES BEING ABLE TO PAY BACK THE LOAN IS QUITEA BURDEN SO THE ABILITY TO FORGIVE ALONE. HAS THERE'S A LOT OF LOGIC TO IT ON THE OTHER HAND. WOULD WE BE INCENTIVIZING MORE PEOPLE TO GET A TEACHING CREDENTIAL WITH THE UP FRONT. GRANT OR SCHOLARSHIP AS ASSEMBLY STRUCTURED IT AND DO WE HAVE IS PART OF OUR TEACHER SHORTAGE THE FACT THAT FEWER STUDENTS MAY BE MEN TRYING TO PURSUE A CREDENTIAL JUST BECAUSE IF THEY GIVEN THE COST OF THE COLLEGE INVESTMENT TO GET THE CREDENTIAL AND THEN THAT. YOUR INCOME AS A TEACHER. IT THAT THAT MAY BE ESPECIALLY IN RIGHT NOW WITH -- OUR COST OF LIVING IN THE LOW UNEMPLOYMENT AND SUCH THAT MAY BE A BARRIER TO ARE GETTING STUDENTS SO I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE. IF THERE'S ANY. EXTERNAL DATA THAT MIGHT HELP US TO SEE WHICH WOULD WHICH OF THESE APPROACHES WOULD. HELP US INCREASE GIVE US THE MOST LIKELIHOOD OF INCREASED NUMBER OF CREDENTIALS OF TEACHERS WHO ACTUALLY TEACHING CALIFORNIA BUT I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S EVEN AVAILABLE BUT I THINK -- YOU KNOW THAT TWO OR JUGGLING MARLA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I HAD THE PLEASURE OF WORKING ON SUB ONE THE LAST FEW YEARS AND AB. ONE OF THE THINGS RECESSION DID WAS CERTAINLY CLEARED A LOT OF YOUNG TEACHERS -- AND YOU WERE MORE SARS SORT OF HOPING WHILE I WAS ON THAT COMMITTEE THAT WE WOULD DO A SURVEY BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GO BACK TO TEACHING. SO WHY IN WHERE ARE THEY NOW ON WHAT'S GOING ON AND HOW DO WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO COME BACK SO. OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE A NEW TEACHER IF THERE'S A RECESSION OR IF ENROLLMENT LEVELS -- DECLINES THEN IS THE NEW TEACHER THAT'S RELEASED FIRST IT'S THE LIFE -- METHOD. AND SO THAT. THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF TOUGH FOR YOUNG KIDS TO TO FACE THE WHITE OR TAKE AN EXTRA YEAR OF EDUCATION. WITH THE POTENTIAL THAT I'LL BE THE FIRST. ONE TO BE REMOVED FROM STAFF SO [inaudible] DOES THIS. PROGRAM THE TEACHER SERVICE CREDIT SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM DOES IT HAVE LIFE FOR PROTECTION. ANOTHER WORDS IF IF IF A STUDENT -- NOW TEACHES IN IN THE SECOND YEAR THEY'RE LAID OFF BECAUSE OF WHATEVER. THAT WOULD THEY HAVE TO GET BACK THE SCHOLARSHIP OR A PORTION OF IT -- PROGRAM -- OR WITH WITH WOULD THEY BE PROTECTED FROM THAT [inaudible] JUST. JOINT I DON'T BELIEVE THERE ANY SPECIFIC LIFO PROTECTIONS IN THERE THERE ARE A WITHIN THE THE ADMINISTRATION STRUCTURE THERE IS A TO PEARL DEFERMENT -- PERSPECTIVE IN THE PROGRAM -- THAT'S A CARRY OVER FROM THE OLD APPLE PROGRAM AND WHAT THAT DOES IS IT ENABLES I BELIEVE IT'S FOR APPROVED TEN YEAR PERIOD FOR PORTIONS OF YOUR SCHOLARSHIP OR IN THAT CASE LOAN FORGIVENESS. TO BE DEFERRED FOR UP TO TEN YEARS THERE ARE SPECIFIED REASONS IN THE WALL WHY THOSE DEPARTMENTS CAN OCCUR -- BUT CERTAINLY I THINK THE MORE IMPORTANT ASPECT THAT WERE WERE FOCUSED ON AS WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL THOUSAND EIGHT THINK IT'S EIGHT THOUSAND TEACHERS ON WAIVERS ARE PERMITS IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WE KNOW IN 201-617-5000 PERMITAN WAIVERS WERE ISSUED IN STEM AREAS SPECIAL EDUCATION BILINGUAL -- TEACHING ASSIGNMENTS -- SO CERTAINLY I THINK WERE FOCUSED ON HOW WE CAN -- INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF CREDENTIALED TEACHERS USING THIS PROGRAM IN SCHOOL SITES THAT HAVE HIGH NUMBERS OF TEACHERS THAT ARE ON THESE EMERGENCY CREDENTIALS TODAY SO WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A NEED. WE KNOW THAT THEIR TEACHERS NEEDED IN THESE AREAS AND NOW IT IS HOW CAN WE IN SENT ADDITIONAL CREDENTIALED TEACHERS TO BE IN THOSE SCHOOL SITES. YEAH AND I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE RUG PULLED OUT FOR AND FROM UNDERNEATH THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T CONTROL WHETHER THEY'RE LATE OFFERED [inaudible] CERTAINLY UNDERSTOOD. THANK YOU MISTER MCCARTY YEAH I THINK THERE'S TWO ISSUES HERE THE ONE AS AS MISS SKINNER SAID THERE ARE TEACHERS WHO ARE. STRUGGLING AND IN THE BAY AREA AT THAT INCREDIBLE ARTICLE FEW WEEKS AGO DOUBLE AND TRIPLING UP WITH FEDERAL FEATHER FELLOW TEACHERS AN APART MANNER. LIVING WITH A GRANDMA BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD. DESPITE THEIR LIVES AND TEACHER SALARY WAS SO MUCH STUDENT DEBT SO MORE IT HELPED ADDRESS THOSE BUT ALSO DEALING WITH THE FACT THERE'S A THOUSAND CLASSROOMS TODAY. PRIMARILY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE A TEACHER THAT'S NOT QUALIFIED REALLY. I KNOW IT NÃ³I ELSE TO PUT IT AND SO YOU KNOW THE EFFORTS IS IT A WINDFALL TO DO WE DO HAVE A PROGRAM THAT HELPS PEOPLE THAT ARE YOU TEACHING OR DO WE HELP. GET PEOPLE IN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND SO. WE LOOKED AT THAT THE AT THE RESEARCH FROM THAT LPI LEARNING POLICIES TO WHICH IS HEADED BY. LINDA DARLING HAMMOND USE NOW OF COURSE THE GOVERNOR'S -- BOARD OF EDUCATION -- THAT CHIEF AND THIS WAS THE ONE THAT WE THOUGHT WAS THE MOST THAT PROVE IN TO GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK AND GET TEACHERS. IN THOSE HIGH. HI HI I NEEDED AREA CLASSROOMS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OFTEN. FINAL ITEM UNDER OUR EDUCATION SECTION -- SHE FORTY ONE MENTAL. BRIAN ANDERSON LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. UNDER -- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR STUDENTS -- THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED FIVE POINT THREE MILLION. ON GOING ON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING TO PROVIDE STERN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT THE UC SYSTEM. THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED THIS REQUEST AND IN ADDITION PROVIDED. FIFTEEN MILLION ON GOING IN TWENTY MILLION ONE TIME FROM THE PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUNDING. FOR STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT THE THREE HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS. THE SENATE REJECTED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND INSTEAD PROVIDED A TOTAL OF FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME. OF WHICH FIVE HUNDRED AND TEN IS NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. AND FORTY MILLION IS FROM PROPOSITION [inaudible] SIXTY THREE FOR PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. I K. TWELVE EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. AND VARIOUS PUBLIC -- HIGHER EDUCATION AGENCIES TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO THEIR STUDENTS [inaudible] RICHEST NOTE AS CONTEXT -- THE OTHER FUNDS SOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE OBVIOUSLY STERN MENTAL SERVICES IS A PRIORITY OF ALL. THREE BODIES HERE -- MANY HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTES TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES PRIMARILY ON A FEE FOR SERVICE BASIS WITH STUDENTS -- FOR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS THEY ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES THE STATE PROVIDES ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION ON GOING -- FOR THOSE STUDENTS -- IN ADDITION. MANY SCHOOLS HAVE REPORTED USING THEIR SUPPLEMENT ON CONCENTRATION GRANT FUNDING UNDER L. C. F. F. TO SUPPORT THESE SERVICES AND RECENTLY THE STATE PROVIDED THIRTY MILLION. IN ONE TIME FUNDING TO SUPPORT. OF VARIOUS BEHAVIOR ON ACADEMIC INTERVENTIONS KNOWN AS THE MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT THESE INCLUDE MANY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES [inaudible] FINANCE. THE ADMINISTRATION THAT CONTINUES TO SUPPORT ITS MAY REVISION PROPOSAL IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING FOR YOU SEE AND WILL ALSO NOTE THAT THIS IS PART OF A PRETTY ROBUST MENTAL HEALTH PACKAGE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. INCLUDING FOR TRAINING FOR MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE WHEN IT COMES TO THE SENATE SPACE SPECIFIC PROPOSAL -- WE WOULD LOVE TO MORE AND MORE INTERESTED IN SOME OF THE DETAILS AROUND HOW THE SENATE IS. ENVISIONING THIS -- BUT WE WILL REITERATE THAT OUT RIGHT NOW GIVEN HOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THE GENERAL FUND AND AND PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IN PARTICULAR -- WE DON'T SEE THESE OTHER ITEMS FITTING AND AS WELL AS WITH PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE WHERE WERE PROPOSING A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN THE WORK FORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING. PROGRAM TO EXPAND THE MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE SO WE DON'T SEE THESE OTHER ITEMS FITTING INTO THE BUDGET RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SENATOR ROBB FOLLOWED BY MORE LOT. WELL I WILL SAY THAT THE TESTIMONY THAT WAS PRESENTED. IN BUDGET SUB ONE WAS PRETTY COMPELLING IN THIS AREA AND COMPELLING BOTH OF THEM IN THE FIRST REGARD THE STUDENTS WHO WERE ATTENDING UC AND SEE ISSUE IN TERMS OF WAIT TIMES FOR APPOINTMENTS AND AND ISSUES SUCH AS THAT BUT FRANKLY EVEN MORE COMPELLING IN THE K.. TWO TO TWELVE ARENA A. OF THIS YEAR. TYSON PTA FOLKS COME TO SEE ME IN MY OFFICE AND THEY BROUGHT SOME STUDENTS WITH THEM IN. A TALK TO THE PARENTS AND THEY TALK TO ME AND THEN THEY TURNED. TURN TO A YOUNG YOUNG MAN I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE WAS TWELVE OR THIRTEEN SITTING ON THE COUCH IN THE OFFICE IN. THEY SAID -- YOU KNOW JOHNNY TELL YOUR STORY AND HE SAID I WAS AT SCHOOL ONE DAY AND I WENT TO THE BATHROOM. AND THERE WAS A YOUNG BOY MY AGE. SITTING ON THE FLOOR CRYING UNCONTROLLABLY -- I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO. I TURNED SINCE WE DIDN'T HAVE A SCHOOL NURSE OR COUNSELOR. ON THE CAMPUS -- I BECAME THE COUNSELOR. TO CALM THE YOUNG MAN IN. GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE HE COULD RETURN THE CLASSROOM. AND IN THE TEACHER COULD HELP THEM. HEY IT BECAME A BOTHERSOME TO ME. WE HAVE COUNTIES WITH PROP SIXTY THREE MONEY. RIVERSIDE COUNTY THE LAST TIME I CHECKED. AT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS SITTING IN THE BANK. LA PROBABLY AS CLOSE TO A BILLION. SO THE IDEA HERE IS TO TRY TO JUMP START THE SYSTEM. AND TO GET COUNTIES. ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN WORKING. PRIMARILY WITH THE K. THROUGH TWELVE DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION -- TO CREATE PARTNERSHIPS. TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH AS SINCE. ON THESE CAMPUSES PERHAPS MAYBE NOT FULL TIME IN ON EVERY CAMPUS BUT HAVE SOME SYSTEM. SO THAT STUDENTS KNOW WHO TO TURN TO PARENTS KNOW WHO TO TURN. TO AND TEACHERS IN CLASSROOMS KNOW WHO TO GO. TO TO PROVIDE. WHAT IS OBVIOUSLY SOME FAIRLY BADLY NEEDED SERVICES? TO STUDENTS UP TO CLEAN K. TO TWELVE BUT IT ALSO -- COULD IMPACT TO CC ISSUE AND AND YOU SEE AS WELL. THAT'S REALLY THE POINT OF THIS SOMEBODY HAS TO START DOING SOMETHING. NOW SOME COUNTIES -- AND SOME COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION ARE ACTIVELY INVOLVED ARE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN PARTICIPATING ON THE PROP. SIXTY THREE COMMITTEES AT THAT I GUESS EXIST AROUND THE STATE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DIVIDE UP THIS MONEY. OTHERS NO PARTICIPATED ALL AND DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENTS DON'T THE TAKEN TAP. SO WHAT WHAT WE HAVE WE HAVE FAILED. THIS EDUCATION SYSTEM WHEN IT COMES TO ROLLING OUT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND WHEN IT BEGINS TO IMPACT. OF TWELVE YEAR OLDS. ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES BUT THAT'S A DISGRACE SO I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS. THE PERFECT WAY TO DO THIS BUT SOMEBODY'S GOT TO FIND SOME MONEY. OR GET A BIG CROWBAR TO PRY MONEY OUT OF COUNTIES. TO FORCE THEM TO INVEST IN SERVICES. ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES. END OF SPEECH PERFECT BUT THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU SIR FOR SHARING THE STORY. MISTER MOORE LÃ . MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANT. TO THANK SENATOR ROSS -- FOR WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO -- BUT IT'S NICE TO SEE THE GOVERNOR ASK FOR FIVE POINT THREE MILLION AND THEN WE RESPOND WITH FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION -- THERE'S GOT TO BE AN AWARD IN THERE FOR THAT [inaudible] BUT I'M. I AM NOT PRE MED BUT I I HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME. MEANWHILE SERVICES ACT OVER THE LAST. DECADE OR SO. IN A LOT OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES YOU REALLY START TO REVEAL THEMSELVES WHEN PEOPLE TURN ABOUT TWENTY ONE SORT OF HAPPENS IN COLLEGE AND OR SEEING A SHOW UP A LOT EARLIER FOR A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS. DURING THE BREAK I HAD THE CHANCE -- TO OBSERVE A PROGRAM IN NEWPORT BEACH WITH HOAG. MEMORIAL PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL. IT'S CALLED A SPIRE AND THEY TAKE THE PARENTS AND THE KIDS TO TAKE HIM OFF CAMPUS IN THEIR TEACHING BOTH BECAUSE PARENTS ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT IS HAPPENING? BUT THEIR CHILD WHEN HE AND IF THEY BASED ON A MODEL OUT OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY. AND IT WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE BUT WHAT WAS MISSING. FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE WAS THAT THE KIDS WOULD LEAVE THE CAMPUS GO TO THE THE CAMPUS FOR THE HOSPITAL. BUT THEY WOULDN'T GET CREDIT FOR THE COURSES. AND SO THERE'S GOT TO BE MAYBE WITH SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS LOOKING FOR INNOVATION WHICH IS WHAT'S BEEN HOLDING UP MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. EVERYTHING HAS TO BE INNOVATIVE AND THERE'S REALLY NOTHING INNOVATIVE ANYMORE -- IF IF WE COULD FOCUS ON JUST DOING MORE INTEGRATION SEVERAL THE SILOS -- WITH PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE. AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT NEEDS FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION IT MAY JUST ALREADY BE SITTING THERE SO IT'S NOT REALLY LIKE A NEW REVENUE -- SOURCE BUT MAYBE MAYBE WE NEED TO WORK WITH THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE MAYBE WE NEED IT BECAUSE OF BECAUSE WORK WERE CHIPPING AWAY. BUT WE'RE WE'RE USING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT OUT TO TO FIND FOR LAURA'S LAW WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT. SENATOR STEINBERG AND I DID BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WITH SB FIVE EIGHTY FIVE WHAT WORK WERE USING. THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE SECTOR. AS A AS A REVENUE SOURCE FOR THAT NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROGRAM TO WORK WITH CANADA DOING THINGS RIGHT BUT IT'S ALL GOING LEGISLATIVELY. IT'S A MAYBE WE NEED TO LOOK AT A A BETTER PACKAGE AND HOW WE INTEGRATE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WITH EDUCATION. SO WE IDENTIFY THINGS MORE. EARLIER AND PROVIDE THE STAFFING WITH ACCOUNTS ARE NOT ONLY A YOU KNOW HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSES BUT BUT ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES ART. I THINK. THE WEEK WE COULD LOOK AT A LITTLE MORE. BROADLY BECAUSE WE WE HAVE RESOURCES. AND AND HOW DO WE USE THEM MORE EFFECTIVELY -- AS OPPOSED TO JUST ALWAYS BEING. LIMITED BY A COMMITTEE THIS OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES HAS NOW THAT'S NOT INNOVATIVE FORGET IT IT'S LIKE WAY TO SAY WE GOT WE GOT TO GET PAST THAT IT'S THAT. GET IT TO WHERE IT WORKS. AND SO THERE'S MY SPEECH THANK YOU AND THANK YOU BOTH AND GOOD SPEECHES THEY WERE INDEED. THEY NEED TO BE BETTER THAN THOSE TO MR MCCARTY SO BRING IT YEAH I DON'T KNOW MUCH I CAN ADD ON THE THE MERIT OF THAT I'M NOT GOING TO ADD YOU GUYS BOTH JUST TALK ABOUT IT WE HAD. A COMPELLING TESTIMONY IN OUR COMMITTEES WELL ESPECIALLY FROM THOSE CALLS STUDENTS TALKING ABOUT WHAT STUDENTS FACE THESE DAYS WITH THEIR FINANCIAL PRESSURES AND A NUMBER -- TWO CAUSE OF DEATH FOR THOSE THIS COHORT IS SUICIDE. AND THE PRESIDENT EVER UNIVERSITY HERE. THEIR OWN SON TOOK HIS LIFE AS A COLLEGE STUDENT SO HE'S BEEN A LEADER IN THIS SPACE I THINK THE ISSUE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT'S IT'S EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING THESE COUNTIES ARE SITTING ON THEIR MONEY. BUT THERE IS SOME MONEY AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT WE OUGHT TO SET SOME STATE PRIORITIES AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING AND I APPLAUD THE SENATE'S FALLS ON OURS IS. IS IT YOU KNOW WE WORKED WITH THE SAME AGAIN SOON TALK ABOUT WHAT COULD SENSE STATE PRIORITIES BE WITH THAT STATE ADMIN MONEY THIS IS SITTING THERE. AT AND NOT LEAVE IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE BUT THIS IS ONE WHERE WE THINK THAT. THAT THAT WE HEARD FROM A STUDENT WHO SAYS SHE HAD A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS SHE WENT TO GO SEE -- SOMEBODY AND THEY SAID WE'LL COME BACK IN THREE WEEKS WELL THE CRISIS IS TODAY. NOT THREE WEEKS I HAD STOPPED ONE OF MY LIFE I HAVE FINALS AND AND IT'S SOMETIMES LIFE OR DEATH AND SO ONE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE INTEGRATED INTO THE HEALTH CENTER NOT. HE IS NOT SOMEWHERE ELSE BECAUSE IT'S IT'S A HEALTH ISSUE GO ON THERE FOR YOU KNOW MIGRAINE HEADACHE OR SOMETHING WITH YOUR BODY IT'S A HEALTH AILMENTS A MENTAL HEALTH SHOULDN'T. BE SOMEWHERE SIZE SHOULD BE IN THERE WITH THE HEALTH SERVICES SELL IS DOT THE STIGMA ATTACHED BUT I THINK WORK FOCUS ON IS TRYING TO SET THESE UP. AS A STATE PRIORITY AND SO MUCH COMPETITION IN GENERAL FUND WE TALKED YESTERDAY ABOUT. ENROLLMENT IN CSU AND YOU SEE ACCESS AND SO THIS WE THINK THAT UNDER PROP SIXTY THREE THERE IS A AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FOCUS ON SOME STATEWIDE PRIORITIES. IN A SIDE TO BE. ONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A GREAT TO BE IT WAS IT WAS SENATOR NIELSEN. TARGET POPULATION IT WILL SOME OF THESE. THE DATE SHOULD BE THE RE ALIGNED. POPULATION THOSE WHO HAVE TRANSITIONED OUT OF CUSTODY AND INTO THE COMMUNITY. ONE OF OUR GREAT DEFICIENCIES IS HAVING SOMEWHERE FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS TO RECEIVE SOME TREATMENT OR SOME HELP. IS THAT PART TARGET POPULATION GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS PROGRAM THE REAL LINE AB ONE OH NINE REALIGNED POPULATIONS. BUT CERTAINLY UNDER THE SENATE'S PROPOSAL IF -- THOSE INDIVIDUALS WERE ENROLLED AND INSTITUTE OF HIGHER LEARNING THEY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE ARE NOW GOING TO TRANSITION. TO RESOURCES AND TRANSPORTATION AND WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT DEPARTMENTS -- HEARING FROM THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY TO EPA TWO FOUR THREE FIRE PROTECTION YOUR RESOURCES. TOXIC SUBSTANCES IN CONTROL DEPARTMENT FOOD NAG [inaudible] CPUC TRANSPORTATION DMV. ALL THOSE FALL WITHIN RESOURCES AND TRANSPORTATION [inaudible] WHAT [inaudible] AND WHERE [inaudible] TRANSITIONING. THE STAFF AND PERSONNEL WHO FOCUS ON THESE POLICY AREAS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GOING TO GET STARTED. WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA NASH NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY.

THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU HERE IS TWO MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ONE TIME FOR THE MARINE MAMMAL CENTER ADDED BY THE ASSEMBLY. NEITHER THE GOVERNOR NOR THE SENATE HAD PROPOSALS ON THIS ISSUE. THIS FUNDING WOULD PROVIDE GRANTS FOR THE CENTER WHICH IS A PRIVATE NONPROFIT AGENCY LOCATED IN MARIN COUNTY TO RESCUE AND REHABILITATE MARINE MAMMALS SUCH AS SEA LIONS AND SEALS. FOR CONTEXT THE STATE HAS PROVIDED SIMILAR ONE TIME GRANTS IN THE AMOUNT OF EITHER ONE MILLION DOLLARS OR TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR EACH OF THE PAST FOUR YEARS. THANK YOU FINANCE WE SUPPORT THE SENATE ON THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WITH MORE LAW AND SHOULD MANAGER JUST WONDERING WHY ONE SPECIFIC MAMMAL CENTER WHEN WE HAVE QUITE A FEW.

ALEJO THE INFERENCE -- ISSUE BEFORE YOU IS TEN MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ONE TIME FOR AT CONSERVATION SONOMA GENOMICS INITIATIVE -- WHICH WAS ADDED BY THE ASSEMBLY THE GOVERNOR AND SENATE DID NOT HAVE PROPOSALS IN THIS AREA. THE FUNDING WOULD GO TO A COLLABORATIVE OF PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES LED BY UCLA TO DEVELOP A DATABASE AND MAPS DETAILING THE LOCATIONS OF THREATENED SPECIES AND THEIR GENETIC VARIATION. AND ALSO TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE EXPECTED IMPACTS OF A CHANGING CLIMATE IN ORDER TO HELP INFORM LAND USE DECISIONS AND CONSERVATION ACTIONS. THANK YOU FINANCE THE DESTRUCTION SUPPORT SENATE ON THIS AS WELL. ANY. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ON CONSERVATION GENOMICS DO NOT MIX BECAUSE THE MORE LIVE ACTORS MANAGER WHY WHEN WHEN WE USE CAP AND TRADE REVENUES FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS. GOOD ANSWER FOR YOU ON THAT AS WELL SUTTER MARLATT. MOVING ON ISSUE THREE PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT IMPLEMENTATION. SO THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU HERE IS A COLLECTION OF EXPENDITURES FROM PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT WHICH WAS THE WATER AND PARKS BOND PASSED BY VOTERS IN JUNE. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS FROM THIS BOND -- IN VARIOUS CATEGORIES AND SPENDING FOR NINETEEN TWENTY AM BOTH HOUSES APPROVED ALL OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS -- THAN BOTH HOUSES ALSO EACH ADOPTED SOME ADDITIONAL ACTIONS SO SPECIFICALLY BOTH HOUSES ADOPTED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE REQUIRING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON HOW IT SPENDS SEVENTY MILLION APPROVED. TO IMPLEMENT VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT PROJECTS ALONG THE SACRAMENTO AND SAN JOAQUIN RIVERS BUT BOTH HOUSES ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT -- THE LANGUAGE IS IS SIMILAR BUT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. AND THEN IN ADDITION THE SENATE ADDED FUNDING FOR THREE SPECIFIC PROJECTS FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR TIJUANA RIVER POLLUTION CONTROL PROJECT IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A RESTORING ALAMEDA CREEK THAT FLOWS INTO THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY. AND THREE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR ARROYO SECCO PROJECTS IN PASADENA. THE ASSEMBLY ADDED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR COMPETITIVE GRANTS FOR HABITAT RESTORATION PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. AND TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE RELATED TO THE TIJUANA RIVER FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION ACTIVITIES. FINANCE. I WILL MAKE TWO POINTS SAID IN GENERAL THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO SUPPORT ITS MAY REVISION PROPOSAL THE FIRST IS THAT WE DO THINK IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFIC PROJECTS THAT BOND FUNDS SHOULD BE ALLOCATED. THROUGH A COMPETITIVE PROCESS AND ON THE SECOND POINT REGARDING THAT'S ONE OF RIVER I'LL LET MY COLLEAGUE SPEAK TO THANK YOU. SIR DO I GO WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE REGARDING THE TWO ONE RIVER BASIN WATER QUALITY TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WHILE WE SHARE LEGISLATURE'S CONCERN REGARDING THIS ISSUE WE WANT TO WORK ON THE ISSUE A LITTLE BIT MORE BROADLY. IN ADDITION THE LANGUAGE DOES RESULT A SIGNIFICANT COST PRESSURES BY INCREASING -- THE EXPECTATIONS THAT CALIFORNIA ADDRESS SOME OF THESE POLLUTION ISSUES ACROSS THE BORDER -- AND THE POLLUTION IN THE TO WONDER BASS AND DOES REPRESENT AN INTERNATIONAL ISSUE -- THAT IT LIKELY DOES REQUIRE SOLUTION DRIVEN BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD ADMINISTRATION WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE SITUATION AND CONTINUE TO APPLY PRESSURE PRESSURE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ADDRESSES ISSUES. THANK YOU QUESTIONS COMMENTS SENATOR NIELSEN. IN WHAT FORM DOES THIS ASSISTANCE. WHAT DOES IT TAKE DO YOU DEPLOY PERSONNEL AS THE LOCALS ARE NEGOTIATING WITH THE AGENCY TO STATE GOVERNMENT THESE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS DO THEY PROVIDE RESOURCES? OUT HOW DOES THIS WORK WHAT FORM OF ASSISTANCE. ARE WE PROVIDING WITH THESE RESOURCES. ARE YOU M.. ASKING REGARDING THE TIJUANA RIVER SENATOR NIELSEN YES WELL IT WOULD BE OTHERS ARE A LOT OF VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS THAT ARE. IN PROCESS NOW. SO IT WOULD NOT JUST BE THE TIJUANA RIVER OKAY SO THE SEVENTY MILLION THAT BOTH HOUSES APPROVED AND FROM PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT AND THEN IN BOTH HOUSES ADOPTED BUDGET BILL ARE SPECIFICALLY AROUND VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS THAT ARE BEING -- NEGOTIATED ON THE SACRAMENTO RIVER AND SAN JOAQUIN RIVER -- IN CONNECTION WITH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD'S WATER QUALITY CONTROL PLAN FOR THE DELTA THAT'S THAT'S UNDER WAY TRYING -- TO ESSENTIALLY -- UNDERTAKE HABITAT RESTORATION PROJECTS THAT WOULD CREATE BENEFITS FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE -- IN ORDER. TO HELP REDUCE IT REDUCE SOME OF THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS SO THAT'S KIND OF AROUND THAT SEVENTY MILLION IN THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE. ON THE TIJUANA RIVER THERE ARE ARE TWO PIECES THAT THE HOUSES TOOK THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW -- FOR FOR EXAMPLE FOR STATE STAFF TO GO ACROSS THE BORDER TO WORK ON SOME ISSUES WITHOUT. HAVING TO GO THROUGH MORE NOTIFICATION PROCESSES THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE SOME KIND OF FACILITATING SOME OF THAT -- RELATIONSHIP BUILDING ON THE SENATE SIDE THERE WAS FIFTEEN MILLION PUT IN PLACE FOR A SPECIFIC PROJECT TO TRAIN -- ADDRESS SOME OF THE POLLUTION THAT'S COMING ACROSS THE BORDER THROUGH THE RIVER THOUGH THE MONIES GO TO EXISTING AGENCIES AND WHO ARE NEGOTIATING. THESE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS AND SO ON THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS YES IT WOULD GO THROUGH THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. THANK. THIRTY MORE LOT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF THE FOR BILLING ARE BY AND WE'RE JUST RELEASING. ONE BILLION -- SO IS THERE A PLAN OR OR A SCHEDULE FOR ISSUANCE OVER. WHAT TIME PERIOD SO IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE CURRENT YEAR WERE THERE WAS ONE POINT THREE BILLION THAT WAS APPROPRIATED BY THE LEGISLATURE THAN FOR NINETEEN TWENTY IT'S A DIFFERENT IT'S AN ADDITIONAL BILLION SO IT'S A ABOUT HALF ALREADY IN THESE FIRST TWO YEARS AND THEN -- USUALLY WHAT HAPPENS WITH BONDS IT WOULD TAKE A LITTLE WHILE FOR THAT TO PERCOLATE DOWN AND THEN -- THERE WILL BE FUTURE APPROPRIATION REQUESTS THAT COME BEFORE YOU IN FUTURE YEARS. AND THE FIFTEEN POINT FIVE NEW POSITIONS -- WILL THOSE BE PAID OUT OF BOND PROCEEDS YES AND THERE WERE QUITE A FEW MAYBE AROUND FIFTY I WANT TO SAY THAT WERE IN THE CURRENT YEAR AS WELL SO THIS FIFTEEN ARE IN ADDITION TO THAT THE THEY HELP IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAMS AT THE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES AND ARE. PAID BY BOND. IN THE MISTER THIS ONE OF FUND -- IT SEEMED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT GOVERNOR BROWN WAS RELUCTANT TO ISSUE. IN BONDS FOR THE SCHOOL BUILDING PROGRAM. BASED ON YOU KNOW WHAT COULD WE AFFORD TO PAY OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE MR FRIENDS GONNA BE SQUEEZE BY THESE PRINCIPAL INTEREST PAYMENTS. AT IS THAT A CONCERN OF YOURS REGIS COME AT GO WITH IT AS IT AS IT AS IT'S DICTATED. SO I THINK FOR THIS BOND IT'S ALREADY BEEN APPROVED BY THE VOTERS SO YOU KNOW WE WILL WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN TERMS OF HOW THE MONEY WILL ACTUALLY BE SPENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BOND. WHEN IT COMES MORE BROADLY TO EDUCATION BOND FUNDING WE KNOW THAT'S A LARGER CONVERSATION THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN IN THE UPCOMING MONTHS? AND OBVIOUSLY FOR THOSE CONVERSATIONS WE ARE BALANCING THE TRADE OFF BETWEEN THE NEED FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR OUR SCHOOLS AND THE FACT THAT IF THERE ARE MORE BONDS TO YOUR POINT. THERE IS MORE PRESSURE ON THE GENERAL FUND SO THE GOVERNOR IS CONSCIOUS OF THAT TRADE OFF. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR YOU'RE VERY WELCOME ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE LET'S TRANSITION. THE ISSUE. FOR THERE IS TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS ARE WITHIN CAL EPA AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL. ROSS BROWN WITH THE LA -- SO THIS ITEM HAS TWO DIFFERENT PIECES ALL COVER THE FIRST AND THEN TURN OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE TO SUMMARIZE THE SECOND. FIRST PIECE IS RELATED TO THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED ROUGHLY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO EXTEND FUNDING FOR TWENTY TWO POSITIONS FOR THREE YEARS -- THAT WERE APPROVED A COUPLE YEARS AGO IN THE BUDGET -- THE POSITIONS AND POINT EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN WHICH IS A PROGRAM FOCUSED ON REDUCING AIR POLLUTION IN HEAVILY POLLUTED COMMUNITIES. THE SENATE REJECTED THE EXTENSION OF THE FUNDING THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED THE FUNDING FOR TWO YEARS INSTEAD OF THREE ON THIS ISSUE WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE THE ASSEMBLY VERSION BECAUSE WE DO THINK THE WORKLOAD JUSTIFIES THE EXTENSION OF THE POSITIONS FOR TWO YEARS THANK YOU. JOHN MARTIN AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- THE SENATE APPROVED THE GOVERNOR'S REQUEST FOR SEVENTY SEVEN AND FORTY NINE THOUSAND GENERAL FUND AND THE-SHIFT TO FIND ILLEGAL DRUG LAB CLEANUPS FROM THE GENERAL FUND INSTEAD OF FROM THE ILLEGAL DRUG LAB CLEANUP ACCOUNT. THE ASSEMBLY REJECTED THE REQUEST WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE MAY BE A COMPROMISE BEING WORKED OUT -- THAT WOULD APPROPRIATE SAID THAT FINDING TO THE ILLEGAL DRUG LAB CLEANUP ACCOUNT THAT WOULD FACILITATE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT BECAUSE YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO BETTER TRACK THE AMOUNT OF SPENDING. ON THESE ACTIVITIES [inaudible] FINANCE. ON THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD -- WE SUPPORT -- THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL AND WE ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT IN LANGUAGE THAT DAY PROPOSED. AND ON THE ILLEGAL DRUG CLASS LAB CLEAN UP ISSUE -- WE SUPPORT THE SENATE PROPOSAL THANK YOU QUESTION SENATOR NELSON. CHARACTERIZE THAT SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT LANGUAGE WE'VE NOT SEEN IT WHAT IS IT GONNA SO THAT IS FROM THE ASSEMBLY SO I SHOULD TURN THAT OVER TO THE LA -- THE THE THE GENERAL JUST IS JUST TO GET MORE MAKES OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS MORE INFORMATION ON KIND OF THE ON GOING WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ACTIVITIES OTHER POSITIONS ARE APPROVED ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS AND SO. THIS IS A RELATIVELY NEW PROGRAM AND SO THE THE LANGUAGE IS SORT OF INTENDED TO MAKE FOR THE LEGISLATURE HAS GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE OUTCOMES OF THE PROGRAM HAVE BEEN AND WHAT THE ON GOING WORKLOAD WOULD BE. ELDERS A VERY IMPORTANT POINTS THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE FIVE REAPPROPRIATION FOR DEPARTMENT CONSERVATION FISH AND WILDLIFE AND TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL. THE ASSEMBLY RE APPROPRIATED HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION TO PROVIDE LOCAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS TO RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS. OF FIVE MILLION FOR THE WINNER RISE HABITAT INCENTIVE FUND AND BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE TO EXTEND THE ENCUMBRANCE PERIOD TWO THREE YEARS. AND THEN TWO MILLION GENERAL FUND FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL TO PROVIDE A LOCAL ASSISTANCE GRANT TO THE LEVINE AND WEBER SCHOOL SITE -- WE VIEW THESE THREE APPROPRIATIONS IS TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT STATE TO FULLY EXPEND FUNDS FOR THEIR INTENDED PURPOSES. FINANCE WHILE THE ADMINISTRATION DID NOT PROPOSE THESE RE PREPARATIONS WE ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THEM IN SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLY APPROACH GREAT QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OUT COLLEAGUES WE'RE PREPARE TO ACTUALLY TAKE ACTION ON THIS ITEM. ON THE RECOMMENDATION IS THE ASSEMBLY VERSION. ARE THEY SHE FIVE THE THE AYE. CAPTION. IS THE RESERVATION I SEE SOME. ON OUR SIDE [inaudible] OKAY GREAT. IT'S BEEN MOVED. WHAT THE THING ON ONE SECOND PLEASE [inaudible] HERE. YOU KNOW WHAT LET'S NOT TAKE ACTION ON THIS LET ME WE STILL HAVE SOME ISSUES WE NEED TO REVIEW. HELP CENTER NIELSEN. HOW ABOUT IF WE OF VOTE ON EACH OF THE ITEMS ON TO THE ASSEMBLY -- RECOMMENDATIONS SEPARATELY ITEMS ONE TWO AND THREE WOULD THAT WORK FOR YOU AND THEN WE CAN TAKE ACTION NOW. IS THAT OKAY. SALT. I'LL ENTERTAIN A MOTION -- THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER -- THAT WILL TAKE. THE FIRST SECTION THREE APPROPRIATION THE REMAINING BALANCE OF APPROXIMATELY. TWO THIRTY THOUSAND WITH A VOTE OF FIVE OH ON THE ASSEMBLY AND FIVE ZERO ON THE SENATE WILL MORE. IT'S A SIMPLE. ITEM TO THE REPURPOSE IN THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE GENERAL FUND FOR THE WINTER RICE HABITAT INCENTIVE PROGRAM THE MOTION. SKINNER GAVE ME THE MOTION THE ASSEMBLY I HAVE. FOUR FOUR ONE FOUR ONE ON THE ASSEMBLY. ANNIE OKAY WITH THIS AND AND AND FOR ALL ON THE SENATE. ON ITEM THREE THE REAPPROPRIATION OF TWO MILLION GENERAL FUND FOR THE D. T. S. C.. ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE IT'S FIVE OH ON THE SENATE SIDE. YES [inaudible] FOR ONE THANK YOU IF WE DID ONE HOW ABOUT THAT EUREKA. ISSUE NUMBER SIX ENHANCED FIRE PROTECTION. UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF FIVE THREE IN FIRE PROTECTION LA -- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST COMPUTERS WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M SO THIS BY PROPOSAL HAS A COUPLE OF PROPOSALS IN AND THERE'S A COUPLE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT ARE A CONFERENCE. SO IN JANUARY THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED AT NINETY FIVE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS MOSTLY FROM THE GENERAL FUND. FOR MULTIPLE DIFFERENT THINGS FOR CAL FIRE TO ENHANCE FIRE RECITE RESPONSE AND SUPPRESSION -- SUCH AS FIRE ENGINES ADDITIONAL STAFF SEEN. A C. ONE THIRTY AIR TANKER PROGRAM -- AS WELL AS THE HEALTH AND WELLNESS PROGRAM AND OTHER ITEMS. IN A MAY THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED A FOUR POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN BUDGET YOUR PLUS ONE AND TWO POINT TWO MILLION AND THE FOLLOWING YEAR AFTER THAT. FOUR EIGHT EXCLUSIVE USE CONTRACT FOR A C. -- ONE THIRTY TANKER AND THIS PROPOSAL IS REALLY TO BE PAIRED WITH THAT THE C. ONE THIRTY PROGRAM THAT WAS PROPOSED. IN JANUARY ARE THE CONTRACT SEE -- ONE THIRTY TANKER WOULD BE USED ON BOTH TO FIGHT FIRES IN THE UPCOMING FIRE SEASON AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEARS OF THE CONTRACT. AS WELL AS PROVIDE EIGHTY AND ACCESS TO AC ONE THIRTY PLAN IN ORDER TO TRAIN THE PILOTS THAT WOULD BE UNDER CONTRACT WITH CAL FIRE -- TO TO FLY THE END. THE C. ONE THIRTY PLANES THAT THAT THAT CAL FIRE IS PROPOSING TO RECEIVE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SEEKING FUNDING. FOR ON THE U. S. SENATE APPROVED GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- MOSTLY AS IS WE'RE PRETTY MUCH ALL AS IS FOUND BUT THEN ADDED ON BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE REQUIRING SOME REPORTING ON THE HEALTH AND WELLNESS PROGRAM. THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED MOST OF THE PROPOSAL BUT REJECTED AT THE C. -- ONE THIRTY TANKER PIECE OF THE PROPOSAL. I WHICH IS THIRTEEN POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE INITIAL YEAR OF OPERATIONS TIME. TO BEGIN STAFFING UP IN TRAINING CREWS A FOR IT -- THE RECEIPT OF THE C. ONE THIRTY AIR TANKERS WHICH ARE KEVIN IF YOU TO YEAR. AS WELL AS TO START SOME CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS TO CONSTRUCT BERWICK'S FOR AND THAT ON LARGER FLIGHT CREWS THAT WOULD BE NEEDED. ON THE ASSEMBLY ALSO REJECTED THE ASSOCIATED MAY REVISION PROPOSAL FOR EIGHT AND EXCLUSIVE USE CONTRACT FOR AS HE WENT THIRTY OR TANK TANKER. OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS -- AND THEN LASTLY THE ASSEMBLY ADDED TO SOME BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE -- FOR AROUND -- DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTIONS AND REQUIRING THAT SOME OF THE NEW POSITIONS BE ENROLLED IN A BURN THE BURN BOSS CERTIFICATION PROGRAM. THIS BEING -- ESTABLISHED THAT WAS SET IN PLACE BY THE WILD FOR LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE FROM LAST YEAR ON THIS REALLY JUST INSURES THAT -- STAFF THERE WILL. AND BE GETTING TRAINED ON THE PROPER WAY TO DO A PRESCRIBED FIRE. SO THE ISSUES THAT ARE IN CONFERENCE ARE PRIMARILY THAT THE C. ONE THIRTY PROGRAM THE JANUARY PEACE AS WELL AS THAT MAKE PROPOSAL. AND ON THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE FROM BOTH HOUSES IS ALSO IN CONFERENCE. SO DURING THE COURSE OF THE BUDGET CYCLE THERE WERE SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT METHODS OF FIGHTING FIRES -- IN PARTICULAR IN THE C. ONE THIRTIES THERE WAS SOME MEDIA REPORTS ABOUT. ON THE LARGE AIR TANKERS MAYBE NOT BEING THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO FIGHT FIRES BECAUSE IN THE INSTANCES WHERE THERE REALLY NEEDED THESE VERY LARGE CATASTROPHIC FIRES. THEY CAN OFTEN BE GROUNDED BECAUSE THE WEATHER CONDITIONS WILL ALLOW THEM TO FLY THE WINDS MIGHT BE. TO GUSTY OR THE SMOKE MIGHT AND PREVENT THEM FROM FLYING. I'M OUR OFFICE HAD ALSO RAISED SOME CONCERNS ABOUT JUST A GENERAL LACK OF INFORMATION ON THE AND OVERALL. ASSESSMENT OF WHICH APPROACHES TO FIGHTING FIRES ARE MORE COST EFFECTIVE -- AND SO WE'D ACTUALLY RECOMMENDED AND IT'S NOT PART OF THIS ITEM IS PART OF YOUR S. ARE A LEGEND OF THAT YOU'LL GET TO LEADER. BUT WE HAD RECOMMENDED I'M DOING AN ASSESSMENT -- OF HAVING HOW FAR REALLY LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW CAUGHT MORE COST EFFECTIVE APPROACH AS THE ASSEMBLY VERSION OF THE S. R. O. BUDGET -- INCLUDE SAID ASSESSMENT SO WE THINK IF YOU DO WANT TO HAVE THAT ASSESSMENT DONE IF YOU DO DECIDE TO GO FORWARD THAT -- A POTENTIAL COMPROMISE HERE -- IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THAT WOULD BE TO MAYBE DO ONE YEAR OF FUNDING FOR THE C. ONE THIRTY PROGRAMS AT LEAST FOR CERTAIN PIECES OF IT -- IN PARTICULAR PROVIDING THAT EXCLUSIVE USE CONTRACT CLEAN FOR A YEAR COULD HELP INFORMING ASSESSMENT OF HOW FREQUENTLY IT WAS USED -- WERE THERE INSTANCES WHERE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DESIRE TO BE USED BUT ENDED UP BEING GROUNDED HOW BECAUSE OF WEATHER. AND AND SO THAT COULD BE ONE POTENTIAL COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES -- IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO THE ASSESSMENT PROVIDING WHEN YOU'RE MAYBE DOESN'T HELP THAT MUCH I AM. BY IF YOU ARE I'M INTERESTED IN MORE INFORMATION THAN THAT AND THAT WHEN YOU'RE WOULD BE HELPFUL. THANK YOU FINANCE PLEASE MAKE THREE BRIEF POINTS FIRST IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MEASURES AS PART OF ITS PACKAGE FOR FIGHTING WILDFIRES. BUT THE C. ONE THIRTIES ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THAT AT THESE -- TANKERS ARE BEING TRANSFERRED AND RETROFITTED AT NO COST TO THE STATE SO ALL THESE ARE OPERATIONAL COSTS AND WE THINK WE REALLY NEED TO START OUR IN THE BUDGET YEAR TO GET THESE UP AND RUNNING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE KNOW GIVEN WHAT WE SAW LAST YEAR THAT. WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR WHATEVER COMES -- AND SO THE SECOND POINT IS WE DO SUPPORT THE SENATE ACTION ON THIS PROPOSAL AND WE ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THE SENATE SO -- LANGUAGE REGARDING HEALTH AND WLLNESS REPORTING -- AND THIRD -- FOR THAT LANGUAGE -- FROM THE ASSEMBLY WE BELIEVE THAT REDUCES FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF PUTTING RESOURCES IN THE HIGHEST NEED AREAS OF THE STATE IN TERMS OF MOST WILD FIRE RESCUE -- SO FOR THAT REASON WE SUPPORT THE SENATE PROPOSAL ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH. WELL I ASSUME -- THIS EFFORT IS. AN EFFORT TO MODERNIZE YEAR FLEET. WITH THE ACQUISITION OF THE UC ONE THIRTIES IS THAT IS THAT THE PROGRAM. THAT'S CORRECT YES. WHEN THE AIRFORCE RESERVE IN THE AIR NATIONAL GUARD BOWS FLY SEE ONE THIRTIES AND? BOTH HAVE A FIRE FIGHTING MISSION. HERE IN CALIFORNIA I THINK THE AIRFORCE RESERVIST ON COLORADO SPRINGS COLORADO. A MY RECOLLECTION I WOULD NOT ON THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE SO I DIDN'T HEAR THE DISCUSSION. IS OUR CALIFORNIA AIR FLEET IS AGING IS THAT NOT CORRECT. AND THE PROP. BENSON BERMAN FINE IT'S ABSOLUTELY YES IT IS AND THE PROBLEM WITH AN AGING. FLEET OF FLYING A FIRE FIGHTING MISSION IS THE STRESS ON THE AIR FRAME IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT WHEN YOU'RE DOING WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO TO DROP THE RETARDANT. WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE? AND THE RISK IS THE WING SNAP OFF. AND THEY DON'T PLAY VERY WELL WITHOUT WINGS. SO I'M A LITTLE. PERPLEXED BY THE DECISION NOT TO PROCEED WITH THIS. C. ONE THIRTY PROGRAM. UNLESS WE'RE GETTING OUT OF THE AIR TANKER BUSINESS. AND WE'RE GOING TO JUST PUT BOOTS ON THE GROUND AND HAVE HELICOPTERS WITH BUCKETS CAN [inaudible] ANYBODY [inaudible] ENLIGHTEN ME. PROBABLY NOT LET ME GO TO CENTER NIELSEN AND THEN BACK TO MR TING CENTER NIELSEN. WE CAN'T JUST BLITHELY SAY THAT. THE FIXED WING AIRCRAFT ARE NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THE TIMES THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL FOR THE TIMES. AND HAVING BEEN VERY CLOSE TO THIS FOR LITERALLY DECADES THE FLEET IS IN TROUBLE. AND WE DO NEED. TO AND THESE PLANES ARE COMING AT LITTLE COST BUT WE DO HAVE TO HAVE. THE THE BEEFING UP OF THE FLEET MEETING THE RESILIENCE QUALITY. THE SAFETY. AND WE DEFINITELY NEED THE TRAINING. I DON'T MIND SOME LANGUAGE HERE BUT THIS IS REALLY CRITICAL TO OUR ABILITIES TO RESPOND. THERE ARE MOMENTARY CIRCUMSTANCES WE SAW ON THIS JUST THE LAST YEAR WE'RE BECAUSE OF SMOKE. SOME OF THOSE FIXED WINGS COULD NOT BE DEPLOYED. BUT WE NEED TO HAVE THEM AVAILABLE. AND NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH BECAUSE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE FIRES THAT WE'RE NOW DEALING WITH SO I WOULD WANT TO MOVE THE SENATE VERSION. THANK YOU I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT THE AIR FLEET IS AGING AND THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE C. ONE FIFTIES THAT WE ARE RECEIVING IS THAT THEY'RE ABOUT FIFTY YEARS OLD IS THAT. CORRECT YOU KNOW THE AGE OF THE AIRCRAFT. I DON'T KNOW THE ACTUAL AGE OF THE ALL OF THE AIRCRAFT I THINK SOME OF THEM MAY BE DIFFERENT IN AGE THEIR SEVEN OF THEM IN TOTAL I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY WERE ALL WHAT'S THE RANGE OF THE AGE. I'M NOT SURE OF TIME AND I CAN GET THAT INFORMATION A FIVE YEARS OLD TEN YEARS OLD I MEAN. I I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBER AGAIN ART ARE UNDERSTANDING THE PRESENTATION SUBCOMMITTEE THAT THEY WERE FIFTY YEARS OLD BUT WHAT'S THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF THE STARCRAFT OF THESE AIRCRAFT. I DON'T KNOW THE LIFE EXPECTANCY I KNOW THAT. A NUMBER OF THE AIRCRAFT WERE ALREADY USING ARE KIND OF SIMILAR I KNOW THAT THE AIRFORCE IS DOING. RETROFITS -- TO THESE AIRCRAFT SO THAT HELPS -- WITH THE WITH LIFE EXPECTANCY WE CAN GET THOSE AT THAT INFORMATION FOR YOU. AND UNDERSTOOD SIZE SO I THINK ARE ARE CONCERNED FROM. OUR HOUSE WAS WE TOTALLY AGREE THAT WE NEED TO AFRAID TO SLEEP -- THE QUESTION WAS IS THE FOR BRINGING AIR AIRCRAFT THAT'S AS OLD AS OUR OLD FLEET WHETHER THAT WAS ACTUALLY AN UPGRADE IN. WITH THAT WAS REALLY THE MOST APPROPRIATE USE OF MONEY -- TOTALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT WE'RE GETTING THIS FOR FREE. I THINK WE WANTED TO STEP BACK FOR A SECOND AND ASK THE THE BIGGER QUESTION WHICH IS. IS THIS REALLY -- ABOUT RATHER THAN SPENDING THE MONEY TO OPERATE. OLD PLANES SHOULD WE ACTUALLY BE TAKING MONEY GOING TO BUY NEW PLANES WHICH I KNOW WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE. COSTLIER BUT IN THE LONG RUN MAY BE THE BETTER FINANCIAL DECISION. SO I THINK THAT WAS OUR CONCERN THAT WE WERE INHERITING FIFTY YEAR OLD PLANTS. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU I'M SURE I COULD PROBABLY SAID SHED SOME LIGHT ON THIS -- CRAFTER LIKE HOUSES THEY'RE NOT LIKE CARS SO IF YOU TOTALLY REFURBISHED AIRCRAFT YOU CAN REALLY MAKE IT. LIKE A NEW AIRCRAFT AND THAT'S OFTEN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE AIRFORCE IS DOING ON ITS LARGE BOMBERS. THEY'RE REFURBISHING BE FIFTY TWOS THAT ARE FIFTY YEARS OLD -- AND THAT'S BECAUSE THAT'S THE MOST COST OF WHAT EFFECTIVE WAY OF MEETING THAT MISSION SO IF I'M SURE THAT THEY HAVE CRUNCH THE NUMBERS AND IF THEY'RE SATISFIED WITH THAT DECISION I'M HIGHLY CONFIDENT THAT THE C. ONE THIRTIES CAN BE. RETURNED TO A CONDITION THAT'S GOING TO SERVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR MANY YEARS -- I DO SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF THE ASSEMBLY ABOUT. WHETHER OR NOT A LARGE FLEET OF C. ONE THIRTIES IS GOING TO HELP US IN OUR FIRE FIGHTING MISSION BUT I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY THE DIRECTION WE NEED TO MOVE AND SO -- I WOULD SUPPORT. EITHER THE SENATE'S PROPOSAL OR AT THE VERY LEAST THE LA -- COMPROMISE THAT WOULD GIVE US SOME FUNDING TO GET THAT PROGRAM RULING. THANK YOU SO MUCH ANY OTHER US INTO NIELSEN WELL I WOULD I'D LIKE TO ADD THAT. ALL THE EGGS ARE NOT IN THE C. ONE FORTY BASKET. THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE'VE. EMBARKED ON SOME HELICOPTERS. TO A GREAT CAPACITY. THEY ARE YOU THEY HAVE A UTILITY AND DIFFERENT AREAS AND SOME PLACES WHERE THESE FIXED WING CANNOT OPERATE. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT CAL FIRE IN ITS ENTIRETY IT RELATES TO THE IN. ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT THAT THEY USE THE GROUND EQUIPMENT THE ENGINES. THE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT ON THE GROUND AND OF COURSE THE YEAR AS WELL. AND THIS THIS IS A A GOOD STEP IN A IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I WOULD ARGUE VERY VOCIFEROUSLY AT AT A VERY CRITICAL TIMING MOMENT BECAUSE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE FIRES WERE NOW AFTER HAVING TO FACE. CENTER OFF. I WILL ALSO IN A MEANS OF THE FACT THAT THE THE AIR FORCE STILL USES THE C. ONE THIRTY PLATFORM FOR THE FIRE FIGHTING MISSION IN VARIOUS. VERSIONS -- INDICATES TO ME THAT IT MUST BE A FAIRLY EFFECTIVE PLATFORM TO DELIVER. A FIRE RETARDANT AND IS PROBABLY SOME ADVANTAGE TO HAVE A A SYSTEM THAT'S COMPATIBLE WITH THE THE MILITARY WHEN WE DO CALL THE MILITARY IN TO HELP -- SOMEWHAT COMPATIBLE ANYWAY -- IT'S PROBABLY AN ADVANTAGE THERE AND I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT -- WHEN I WAS -- IN THE SERVICE. THERE WAS A OF THE C. ONE THIRTY PLATFORM AND IT'S VARIATIONS IN THEIR MANY OF THEM WAS PART OF A FAIRLY RIGOROUS -- A PROGRAM TO A TO RE HAVE BEEN AND INSURE THAT THE WING STRUCTURE THE BOX STRUCTURE -- WAS WAS SUITABLE FOR MILITARY TACTICAL AIRLIFT OPERATIONS WHICH ARE THE THE MOST US PASSED ONE OF THE MOST STRESSFUL OPERATIONS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR IN OUR AIR FORCE FLEET. AND MOST OF THE AIRFORCE AIRPLANES UNFORTUNATELY ARE OVER FIFTY YEARS OLD SO I I WOULDN'T I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE ASSEMBLY I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THESE PLANS. FINANCE YOUR BIGGEST AT THAT CALIFORNIA'S AERIAL PROGRAM I MEAN THE REASON THE S. TO SURROUND AND WORKING AS WELL AS THEY ARE NOW IS BECAUSE THAT PROGRAM. INCLUDES PERIODIC BY BRINGING THE PLANES OUT OF SERVICE AND SENSUALLY STRIPPING THEM DOWN AND REBUILDING THEM AND SO THAT'S HOW THEY MAINTAIN THESE WHAT FOR SONGS AND THAT IS PART OF THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION. OR DEBATE SEEN NONE WILL HOLD THE SADDAM OPEN. ISSUE SEVEN PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS PROGRAM CONTINUATION UNDER CAL FIRE. BY THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED FOUR MILLION DOLLARS O GOING IN IT TO CONTINUE -- THE PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS YEAH PROGRAM AT CAL FIRE THIS PROVIDES I'M TRAINING MANAGEMENT TRAINING AND AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO ALL CAL FIRE PLEASE. THE PROPOSED MAKES A FUNDING -- IS WHAT'S IN QUESTION HEARING CONFERENCE THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE GENERAL FUND A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FIND. AND THEN ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN REIMBURSEMENTS -- THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED THE THE PROPOSAL AS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR WITHOUT MIX OF FUNDING AND THE SENATE APPROVED THE TOTAL FOR A MILLION BUT WITH A DIFFERENT MIX OFFUNDING BASICALLY TAKING OUT THAT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND FROM GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FIND. AND INSTEAD INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND SO THE ISSUE ON CONFERENCE FOR YOU IS THAT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND IN GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FIND OR HAVING THAT FUNDING COME FROM TURN OFF AND THANK YOU FINANCE. A WE SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL AND WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE GIVEN THAT SOME OF THESE EMPLOYEES ACTIVITIES ARE SUPPORTED BY G. R. F. -- PROPORTIONAL. SHARE IS APPROPRIATE HERE. EXCELLENT QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE NUMBER GOING TO HOLD THE SADDAM OFTEN. ISSUE A WILDFIRE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE ADJUSTMENT CALIFORNIA LA JOH. SO IN THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED IN THE SPRING TIME. EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FIND AND TWO POSITIONS FOR CALIFORNIA A POOR IN THE REVIEW AT A WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN SO CAL FIRE IS WORKING WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND PROVIDING TECHNICAL SUPPORT ASSISTANCE. ON AND ASSISTING IN THE REVIEW OF THOSE WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS THAT ARE SUBMITTED BY UTILITIES. I'M GIVEN THAT THESE PLANS ARE MUCH MORE ROBUST UNDER SB I KNOW WHEN I'M ADDITIONAL STAFF WAS -- REQUESTED. THE SENATE APPROVED GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AS PROPOSED THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT LIMITED TO A TWO YEAR TERM. THANK YOU FINANCE SO WE ARE -- ALTHOUGH THE SENATE WE ARE IN CONCURRENCE WITH THE SENATE WE ARE ACTUALLY COMFORTABLE WITH THE ACTIONS OF EITHER HOUSE IN THIS CASE. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THREE NINE HOLE THAT I'VE ITEM OPEN. MOVING ON TO ISSUE. NINE HELLO -- OFFICE OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL FIRE AND LIFE SAFETY UNDER CAL FIRE ELIA. SO THIS PROPOSAL CAME OUT OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S MISSION BASED REVIEW OF THE OFFICE OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL ON AND AN ADDRESS I AM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS WORKED WITH THE OFFICE I'M GOING THROUGH SORT OF PROGRAM BY PROGRAM. THE COMPLETED A PORTION OF THE MISSION BASED REVIEW FOR THAT FIRE AND LIFE SAFETY DIVISION AND THEN MADE THIS PROPOSAL TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THAT DIVISION OUT BASED ON THE REVIEW -- WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED WAYS AND ONE POINT SIX MILLION IN FUNDING? IN THE AND BUDGET YEAR AND A ONE POINT FIVE MILLION IN FUNDING ON GOING AND EIGHT POSITIONS -- TO HANDLE INCREASED WORKLOAD I'M SOMEONE TIME FUNDING -- FOR AN ANALYSIS AT THE FEE STRUCTURE OF HOW ARE THE FOR MARTIAL CHARGES FEES. AND AND THEN TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- TO CLARIFY THE INSTANCES WHERE THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CONDUCTING CERTAIN INSPECTIONS -- AS WELL AS VARIOUS TECHNICAL CHANGE AS ARE THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED THE PROPOSAL AS PROPOSED ON AND THE SENATE REJECTED THE PROPOSAL. OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE REASON WHY IT WAS REJECTED WAS JUST BECAUSE THE MISSION BASED REVIEW IS ON GOING IN AND SO ON THE LEGISLATURE HASN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THE FULL AND COMPLETE. PICTURE OF THE FINDINGS FROM THAT MISSION BASED RUBIO. I'M IN THIS CASE BECAUSE OF THAT COMPONENT OF THE MISSION BASED REVIEW -- RELATED TO THIS DIVISION HAS BEEN COMPLETED -- AND THE PROPOSAL DID SEEM TO ADDRESS CONCERNS WE'VE HEARD ANECDOTALLY OVER THE YEARS -- WE THINK THAT AND APPROVING THE PROPOSAL I'M GOING WITH THE ASSEMBLY VERSION AND CAN CAN MAKE SENSE -- IF THEY'RE STILL ONGOING CONCERNS ABOUT WANTING MORE INFORMATION BACK ON THE RESULTS OF THE MISSION BASED REVIEW OR HOW IT FITS IN WITH THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF THAT. ON THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALWAYS AB REQUIRE ADDITIONAL -- REPORTING BACK ON THAT -- AND THIS IS ALSO A PROPOSAL THAT COULD BE BROUGHT BACK IN A FUTURE HERE AS WELL SO. THANK YOU ARE AND FINANCE OF THE SENATE TODAY IS PREPARED TO VOTE AND ACCEPT THE ASSEMBLY VERSION. AND FINANCES SUPPORTS THE ASSEMBLY VERSIONS THE AUDIO NOTED HOW WE THINK THAT THE RELUCTANCE IN THE SENSE OF TWO IS REALLY IT WAS BASED ON HOW FAR WERE IN THE ENTIRE OFFICE STATE FARMERS REVIEW BUT WE HAVE COMPLETED REVIEW OF THE FIRE AND LIFE SAFETY DIVISION. AND WE'RE GOING THROUGH THAT OFFICE DIVISION BY DIVISION SO WE THINK THAT THESE RESOURCES ARE REALLY CRITICAL THIS TIME TO SUPPORT CAPITAL PROJECTS AND IMPROVE THE REVIEWS OF THE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE. THANK YOU ALL ENTERTAINMENT MOTION TO ACCEPT IS THE ONLY VERSION. THANK YOU -- THE SENATE IS THAT A QUESTION FOR THE MORE LOT THIRTY MORE LOCK. IS WHEN WILL THIS REVIEW BE COMPLETED IT'S ARE AT THE DEADLINE. THE THE NATURE OF THE MISSION BASED REVIEW APPROACH IS THAT WE DON'T PUT A FIXED DEADLINE ON THEM BECAUSE WE WERE TRYING TO GO THROUGH AND KIND OF TAKE ISSUES AS THEY COME UP AND MAKE SURE WE FOLLOW THEM THROUGH ALL THE WAY TO GET TO THE CORE OF THE ISSUES. BEFORE WE TRY AND SOLVE THEM -- BUT WE THINK THAT WILL BE DONE WITH THE OFF STATE FIRE MARSHAL IN TOTALITY ALL OF ITS DIVISIONS PROBABLY IN ABOUT ANOTHER YEAR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FIVE IN A TEAM -- MOTION THE SENATE IS A VOTE OF OKAY. MISTER MOORE LÃ  [inaudible] A THREE TWO ONE WE'RE FIVE ON THE ASSEMBLY IS FIVE TO NOTHING. THANK YOU MOVING ON TO ISSUE TEN THE CALIFORNIA BIODIVERSITY INITIATIVE UNDERSEA THE FAA. LA -- WHEN YOU'RE READY? SHAMMAR WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED THE GERM PLASM COMPONENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S BIO DIVERSITY PROPOSAL WHICH WOULD REVIVE. FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS GENERAL FUND TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. THE SENATE REJECTED THE GOVERNOR'S THAT THAT THE GERM PLASM COMPOENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S BIODIVERSITY PROPOSAL AND INSTEAD APPROVED EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AS FOLLOWS. TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR FOR THREE YEARS FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL LICENSE PLATE FUND -- FOR COLLECTION OF RARE PLANTS THROUGH CONTRACTS OR GRANTS WITH THE CALIFORNIA PLANT RESCUE PROGRAM AND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ON GOING FOR A POSITION TO OVERSEE. THE CONTRACTS ARE GRANT AND MONITOR AN UPDATE THE STATUS OF NATIVE PLANTS REGARDING THE GERM PLASM PROGRAM -- WE THINK THEY'RE REASONABLE ARGUMENTS FOR HOUSING COMPONENTS AND FUNCTIONS OF THE PROGRAM IN EITHER THE PARCHMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE OR THE DEPARTMENT IF THEY NAPA CULTURE. ELIA FUSE ME FINANCE. CALIFORNIA BIODIVERSITY INITIATIVE WROTE BACK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS [inaudible] QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THREE NINE WILL HOLD THE SADDAM OFTEN. ISSUE ELEVEN HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND SUNSET EXTENSION [inaudible] ELIA. ASA THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU IS WHETHER TO EXTEND ANNUAL FUNDING FOR THE HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND AS PROPOSED IN TRAILER BILL BY THE ASSEMBLY THE SENATE AND GOVERNOR HAD NO PROPOSAL ON THIS ISSUE. THIS FUND WAS CREATED BY A VOTER INITIATIVE PROPOSITION ONE SEVENTEEN IN NINETEEN NINETY THE INITIATIVE REQUIRES THE STATE TO DEPOSIT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY INTO THIS FUND BY A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS. I EACH YEAR BUT A CERTAIN AMOUNT MUST COME FROM THE STATE'S TOBACCO TAX FUNDS IN RECENT YEARS THAT'S BEEN ABOUT HALF ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION OF THE THIRTY MILLION. AND THE STATE HAS USED VARIOUS OTHER RESOURCES TO MAKE UP THE REMAINDER OF THE THIRTY MILLION INCLUDING GENERAL FUND. ENVIRONMENTAL LICENSE PLATE FUND AND BONDS -- PROPOSITION ONE SEVENTEEN ALSO SPECIFIED HOW THE MONIES FROM THIS FUNDS MUST BE USED EACH YEAR THE BULK OF IT -- IS FOR THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD. TO ACQUIRE LANDS FOR CONSERVATION IN VARIOUS SPECIFIED CATEGORIES THERE'S ALSO SOME FUNDING FOR PARKS AND CONSERVANCY'S TO DO ACQUISITIONS AS WELL. THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION OF THIS THIRTY MILLION AND THE REQUIRED EXPENDITURE CATEGORIES ARE EXPENSE AS SCHEDULED TO SUNSET. IN TWENTY TWENTY SO THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL WOULD EXTEND THEM FOR AN ADDITIONAL TEN YEARS. I WILL NOTE THAT ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO ACTION TAKEN BY THE SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE ON THIS ISSUE THERE IS ACTIVE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD EXTEND THIS SB. FOUR SEVEN FOUR I WOULD EXTEND THE FUN BUT WITHOUT THE CONTINUES APPROPRIATION IT WOULD MAKE IT CONTINUING -- CONTINGENT ON AN ANNUAL BUDGET APPROPRIATION AND ALSO WOULD REMOVE THE SPECIFIC EXPENDITURE CATEGORIES WITHIN THE FUND'S. THANK YOU FINANCE A WILL KNOW THAT WHILE THE GOVERNOR DID NOT HAVE A PROPOSAL HERE -- WE ARE COMFORTABLE AND SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLY IS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE EXCELLENT THANK YOU. PERFECT THANK YOU QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTER NIELSEN ANALYSTS. THIS WILL RESULT IN MORE ACQUIRING OF LANCE. AND HAS THE BILL OVER THE DECADES A PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA OF ACQUIRING LANDS INDOOR CONVERSION INTO PARKS OR WHATEVER. THE STATE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN THESE. THIS WOULD APPEAR TO BE A PRETTY BOLD PLAN. OF TAKING LANDS IN THE STATE AUTHORITY. BUT IS THERE A PLAN TO MAINTAIN THESE PLANTS. I THINK OFTEN MANY OF THESE GRANTS ARE -- FROM LAND TRUSTS OR OTHER NON NONPROFIT OR OTHER ENTITIES THAT APPLY FOR THE FUNDS IN ORDER TO DO THAT THROUGH A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS THROUGH WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD SO WHILE THERE MAY BE SOME CATEGORIES WHERE THE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE OR THE STATE PARKS TAKE ON THE LAND I DON'T. THINK THAT'S EXCLUSIVE FOR ALL THESE I THINK MANY OF THEM ARE COMING FROM THE FIELD IF YOU WELL -- APPLYING TO TIP PUT LAB LAND IN CONSERVATION. AND SOMETIMES THEY ARE NOT MAINTAINED THAT IS A PROBLEM THAT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT THE STATE HAS STRUGGLED WITH FOR LANDS THAT ARE IN STATE OWNERSHIP ONGOING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE FOR SHORE QUESTION. THE NUMBER HOLD OF SADDAM OFTEN THANK YOU. MOVING ON TO ISSUE TWELVE CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN. HELLO WHEN YOU'RE READY. ROSS BROWN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE DO HAVE A HANDOUT ON THIS ISSUE THAT -- HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE IN YOUR PACKETS ALL GO THROUGH THAT VERY BRIEFLY -- SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT. JUST PROVIDES A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE THREE DIFFERENT CAP AND TRADE. EXPENDITURE PACKAGES ON JUST THE REVENUES -- EXPENDITURE AMOUNTS AND THEN IN DEAR FUND BALANCES -- SO A COUPLE THINGS TO HIGHLIGHT HERE ON THE REVENUES ABOUT THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY ADOPTED AN ASSUMPTION OF HIGHER REVENUES IN THE IN THE GOVERNOR DID AND BOTH HOUSES ALSO ADOPTED -- SOMEWHAT HIGHER SPENDING -- THAN THE GOVERNOR DID -- SO THE SENATE ADOPTED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS MORE IN THE OVERALL SPENDING ON THE GOVERNOR'S PACKAGE THE ASSEMBLY IS ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS MORE. AND YOU CAN KIND OF SEE THE THE AND FUND BALANCES UNDER UNDER THE DIFFERENT PLANS AND THE TABLE THERE -- SO JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK COMMENTS FIRST ON THE THE REVENUE -- WE ACTUALLY THINK BOTH THROUGH GOVERNOR'S REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS AS WELL AS THE HOUSES BOTH HOUSES REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS ARE REASONABLE THAT JUST KIND OF A DIFFERENCE IN. THE LEVEL OF RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. BASICALLY THE GOVERNOR'S -- ABSTINENCE ASSUME -- PRICES CONTINUE IT THE WAY THEY THEN ESSENTIALLY COLOR OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WHERE AS BOTH. THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY ASSUME -- THE MARKET FOR ALLOWANCES AND PRICES KIND OF CONTINUE AT THE WHAT WAS SEEN IN THE MOST RECENT AUCTIONS SO WE THINK FOR BOTH -- REASONABLE BUT THE SENATE ASSEMBLY -- VERSIONS RICHEST SOMEWHAT MORE RISKY AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO KIND OF KEEP IN MIND ABOUT KIND OF HOW TO PLAN FOR THAT IF YOUR SIM IN SOMEONE HIGHER REVENUES GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY IN REVENUES. COUPLE THINGS TO THINK ABOUT ONE THE FUN CONDITION THAT KIND OF THE OVERALL SIZE OF THE FUND CONDITION -- IN THE FUN CONDITIONS OVER BOTH HOUSES ARE ARE SOMEWHAT MODEST -- BUT THE ASSEMBLY IS A SLIGHTLY HIGHER -- ALSO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER BOTH PLANS AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN INCLUDE SOME BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THEY GIVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SOME AUTHORITY. TO FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS TO ADJUST THOSE ALLOCATIONS DOWN WORD OF REVENUE COMES IN LOWER THAN EXPECTED SO THAT'S A OUT ONE WAY TO CAN MITIGATE AGAINST THE THE RISK OF LOWER THAN EXPECTED REVENUES. AND THEN THIRD THE FINAL ISSUE% IS JUST ONE THING ABOUT THE OVERALL PACKAGE IN THE AMOUNT OF SPENDING WE THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND. OUT YOUR REVENUES IN THE LEVEL OF RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE BEYOND THE BUDGET YEAR AND SO -- OUR VIEW OF KIND OF LOOKING AT THE OUT YEAR REVENUES THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT THE AMOUNT THAT'S AVAILABLE. FOR A DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURES THAT ARE ALLOCATED IN THE BUDGET -- WILL BE COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN KIND OF THE AMOUNT THAT'S IN THIS BUDGET AND SO THINKING ABOUT -- YEAH REVENUE THAT'S AVAILABLE COULD BE YOU KNOW AND AND THE RANGE OF A BILLION DOLLARS OR LASSEN THESE PACKAGES PROVIDE ABOUT ONE POINT FOUR BILLION AND SO THINKING ABOUT THAT WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW MUCH. MONEY TO LEAVE IN THE FUND BALANCE FOR FOR FUTURE YEARS WE THINK IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION. SO -- PAGES TWO AND THREE OF THE HAND OUT. INCLUDE JUST A SUMMARY OF THE WE'LL GO OVER THOSE IN DETAIL -- IN GENERAL WE JUST. ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO ALLOCATE IN FUNDING ACCORDING TO ITS PRIORITIES AND DIFFERENT GOALS. A HIGH LEVEL THE ASSEMBLY -- ALLOCATES MORE MONEY THAN THE SENATE DOES TO A COUPLE PROGRAMS LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION GENERALLY AND I SHOULD SAY. FORGET ABOUT THE ASSEMBLY PACKAGE -- ALLOCATES MONEY TO KIND OF GENERAL CATEGORIES OF PROGRAMS AND NOT -- SPECIFIC PROGRAMS I THINK WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THOSE -- THOSE DETAILS WOULD BE WORKED OUT THROUGH THIS PROCESS -- SO THE ASSEMBLY ALLOCATES MORE THAN THE SENATE TO LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION AND TOXIC ENTRY CRITERIA POLLUTANT PROGRAMS -- OR AS THE SENATE -- TENDS TO PRIORITIZE -- FOR ITS -- RESILIENCY AN ADAPTATION AND SOME AND AGAIN AND WASTE A VERSION AND RECYCLING. SO THE FINAL PAGE OF THE HANDOUT PAGE -- FOUR JUST NOT ONE NOTE EVERYTHING ON THIS PAGE WITH SIR FOR YOUR REFERENCES ARE SOME DIFFERENCES AND BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE AND PLACER BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE IN PLACE HOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- FOR THE PLACEHOLDER BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE ONE THING ON NOTE IS THAT THE ASSEMBLY PACKAGE BOTH THE CENTER IN THE ASSEMBLY REJECTED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND TRADING AT THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD I WOULD BE KIND OF A NEW -- PART OF MONEY FOR G. R. S. -- BUT THE ASSEMBLY PACKAGE ALLOCATED INSTEAD TWENTY SEVEN MILLION TO A PROGRAM THAT'S CURRENTLY OPERATING AT THE CC IN WITH. ALLOCATE MORE MONEY FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING THROUGH THAT PROGRAM -- AS FAR AS THAT PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ADOPTED BY THE ASSEMBLY -- ONE THING I'LL I'LL NOTE NOW THAT LAST BULLET THERE IS THAT IT PROVIDES A LEGISLATURE THE INTENT IS TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN. ON OPTIONS THAT CARP IS CONSIDERING TO ADDRESS -- A FUNDING GAP AND IT'S CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROJECT WHICH IS THE PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES INCENTIVES. FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES THROUGH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD SO -- IN MY COMMENTS THEY'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. FINANCE THE WILL OPEN OPEN OPEN IT FOR QUESTIONS SO THE ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE NAY REVISION PROPOSAL AND I WILL MAKE I JUST TWO COMMENTS AND AND HAPPY TO GO INTO ANY DETAILS WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE. THE FIRST IS THAT THE LEVEL OF SPENDING -- IN THESE PROPOSALS FOR G. R. F. -- THAT NAY AUCTION RESULTS CAME IN AND NOW WE TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS UP TO AN ADDITIONAL SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE -- COMPARED TO WHAT WE LAST PROPOSED THAT BEING SAID THAT LEVEL IS STILL TENS OF MILLIONS OR IN ONE CASE EVEN OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. HELLO -- THE LEVELS PROPOSED BY EITHER HOUSE SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROPOSAL THAT IS ENACTED IS ACTUALLY IN LINE WITH THE REVENUES THAT WE EXPECT. AND THEN THE SECOND POINT THAT I WANT TO MAKE -- IN RELATION TO THE LAST COMMENT FROM THE LA -- REGARDING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A KEY COMPONENT OR NEEDS TO BE A KEY COMPONENT OF TRANSITION TO A LOW CARBON ECONOMY AND SO IT IS IN A VERY IMPORTANT PART. OF THE GOVERNOR'S CAP AND TRADE PLAN AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSING THAT WITH YOU THANK YOU. MR MAYES FOLLOWED BY MR OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- WANTED TO JUST DOUG GO OVER A COUPLE OF ITEMS HERE IF I IF I CAN -- I THINK. MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT WHAT WE START TO TALK ABOUT CAP AND TRADE IT IS A BIT OF A SENSITIVE SUBJECT. FOR ME IN FACT I STILL HAVE A SCHOLARS -- BECAUSE OF OF IT NOW THEY'RE ALL HEALED NOW BUT THERE IS SOME THAT'S WHY I LET YOU SPEAK FOR A THANK YOU -- BUT THERE ARE SOME SOME SCHOLARS -- AND ONE A KILLER -- ITEM THAT WAS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WHEN WE DID THE NEGOTIATIONS -- WAS THE FINAL SUNDAY THAT -- AND RELIVE THE WHOLE THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE -- BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HAD FAILED TO DO NUMBERS TO EDUCATE FOLKS PRIOR TO THE DEAL BEING DONE -- AND IT WAS -- MONDAY HE A LATE MONDAY EVENING -- AND THE REASON WE DIDN'T GET OUT OF IT BEFORE THAT MONDAY EVENING WAS ON SUNDAY -- THERE WAS -- NIT FINAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH AG A TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MEMBERS THAT WE HAD IN OUR CAUCUS WE'RE GOING TO BE SUPPORT OF THE WHOLE CONCEPT WAS THAT AG HAD TO BE. A TAKEN CARE OF AND THE FARMER PROGRAM -- WHAT WHAT'S NOW THE FORMER PROGRAM WAS A BIG PIECE OF THAT PUZZLE? DURING THE INITIAL THE BUDGET THIS YEAR THAT WAS THE GOVERNOR SUBMITTED WAS TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THE FORMER PROGRAM I BELIEVE NOW THE MAY REVISION. IT'S NINETY MILLION -- BUT THE LAST YEAR WAS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION AND AND ONE CARD IS DONE THEIR ANALYSIS IT IS STILL SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN WHAT THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS GONNA NEED. TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND OTHER CRITERIA POLLUTANTS IN REGARDS -- TO TO AG EQUIPMENT AND SO WHY ARE WE FUNDING IT AT LEAST A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MEN ON REALITY IT NEEDS TO BE MUCH. MUCH HIGHER. OF METAL ME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO JUST FOR CONTEXT -- LAST YEAR'S CAP AND TRADE PACKAGE WAS A ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR. OVERALL PACKAGE IN AS THE ELLIE -- CORRECTLY NOTED -- THE REVENUES FLUCTUATING KIND OVER TIME YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE LESS. YOU KNOW IN OUT YEARS AND SO THE MAY REVISION PACKAGE. OVERALL WAS ONE POINT TWO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS SO. THE FARMER PROGRAM WHILE YOU'RE CORRECT IT IS LESS. IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT A LOT OF THE OTHER CATEGORIES ALSO -- ARE LESS COMPARED TO WHAT THEY WERE IN PRIOR YEARS SO -- WHAT I CAN JUST SAY IS IS THE THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAMME WASN'T SINGLED OUT IN FOR OR OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THERE IS -- THE AB SIX SEVENTEEN THE PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE LAST YEAR IS TWO FIFTY THIS YEAR IT'S TWO HUNDRED THERE'S SOME OTHER EXAMPLES IT JUST REFLECTS THE FACT THAT AS AN OVERALL PACKAGE. THERE'S LESS AVAILABLE AND OF GET. YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN WHICH IS THE ACT DIESEL REPLACEMENT CHECKS A LOT OF BOXES AND TURNS TO GHG REDUCTIONS IN TERMS OF REDUCTIONS IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOSTLY IMPACTED AS WELL AS BENEFITING THE AG SECTOR SO -- WE DO THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE UCH A STRONG INVESTMENT BUT IT JUST REFLECTS THE AMOUNT OF OVERALL AVAILABILITY. AND YET WE WERE STILL ADDING IN NEW PROGRAMS AS WELL. INTO THIS WAS A JUST A TWENTY SEVEN MILLION I MIGHT HAVE MISSED THAT SO I'LL SPEAK BRIEFLY THEN MAC INFO ON THIS. ONE NEW PROPOSAL IS THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IT'S VERY DIFFERENT IN THE SENSE THAT THERE ARE THE OTHER PROPOSALS IN OUR CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM DO NOT HAVE THAT DIRECT FOCUS ON TRANSITION TO A LOW CARBON ECONOMY FOR WORK FORCE WITH AN EMPHASIS ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BUT AS MATT. MENTIONED THE OVERALL PACKAGE IS OVER A BILLION DOLLARS OF THIS IS ABOUT 3% OF THE OVERALL. OKAY. AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT AND THERE'S ONE OTHER ITEM. IN LOOKING AT THIS IN REGARDS TO FOREST'S. THERE'S TWO HUNDRED MILLION FROM THE GOVERNOR TWO HUNDRED MILLION FROM THE SENATE I THOUGHT THE GOVERNOR WAS PROPOSING. NOT TO UNDERMINE WITH THREE HUNDRED MILLION IS THAT GENERAL FUND OR OR OR DID I DID I MISUNDERSTAND THIS IS BACK IN FEBRUARY. TALKING ABOUT THAT WE HAD TO TO DO MORE INVESTMENT. FOR FOR FOR HEALTHY FORESTS -- I THOUGHT WITH WE'RE GONNA LOOK INTO A MILLION TO THREE HUNDRED MILLION THE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION IS A CONSISTENT WITH A SB NINE A ONE A FRAMEWORK OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION. ON AN ONGOING BASIS NOW THAT ISN'T TO SAY THAT THERE AREN'T. OTHER INVESTMENTS IN THE FORESTRY FORCED HEALTH AREA IT'S A PORTFOLIO APPROACH AS WE TALKED ABOUT THE C. ONE THIRTIES WE TALKED ABOUT ADDITIONAL ENGINES. THE YEAR ROUND ENGINES ALSO HAS A FIRE PREVENTION. OF BENEFIT IN THE SENSE THAT WHEN IT'S OFF OF A OFF PEAK SEASON THEY'RE ALSO DOING ADDITIONAL FUEL REDUCTION WORK. SO IT'S KIND OF A A PORTFOLIO APPROACH BUT IN TERMS OF THE CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN THAT'S REALLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION. OKAY AND THEN DEFINING MADAM CHAIR OF THE ONE THING IF I COULD ADVOCATE FOR HIS ANY FLEXIBILITY IN THIS AT ALL OF THE IF WE COULD INCREASE THAT FARMER. A FARMER AMOUNT. SIR -- MR OBERNOLTE FOLLOWED BY MISTER MOORE LOT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO I'D LIKE TO TAKE YOU BACK ON THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE ON FOREST'S BECAUSE I WHEN I SERVED ON BUDGETS OF THREE I WAS ALWAYS AMAZED. AT THE DIFFERENCE THE DEFICIENCIES WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT USE OF G. G. R. F. MONEY IF YOU LOOK AT THE TO FIND EFFICIENCY AS HOW MANY TONS OF CARBON CAN WE REDUCE FOR A GIVEN DOLLAR THAT WE SPEND. BY. FUELS REDUCTION WITH AND ENFORCED INITIATIVES WERE ALWAYS NEAR THE TOP OF THAT LIST. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE. THAT A LARGE FOREST FIRE REPRESENTS A HUGE DE SEQUESTRATION OF CARBON DIOXIDE AND THAT ONE FOREST FIRE CAN WIPE OUT ALL THE RESTORE CARBON REDUCTION EFFORTS AND THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE. THE IN IN -- ONE OF THAT FOR THE FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR SO I REALLY VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE USE OF DID YOU ARE A FUNDS FOR THAT AND ALSO I THINK THEY'RE CONGRUENT WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT. STATE PRIORITIES NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS -- WHEN THE WITH THE THE YOU UTILITY PROBLEMS SB NINE ONE WE'RE HAVING OBVIOUSLY BUT ALSO AIR QUALITY BECAUSE THAT BLACK CARBON THAT? GETS SUBMITTED BY THOSE FOREST FIRES IS -- IN A REALLY THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE THING FOR QUALITY THAT WITH THAT -- THAT OCCURS SO -- THE I WOULD ENCOURAGE US TO CONSIDER. A LEVEL OF EXPENDITURE CLOSER TO THE SENATE VERSION DOWN WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED OR WHAT THE ASSEMBLY HAS PROPOSED. IN THAT RESPECT. I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT -- THE PLACEHOLDER PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THE TO THE ASSEMBLY VERSION I WONDER IF SOMEONE COULD TALK ABOUT. WHAT EXACTLY THE INTENT IS WITH THAT BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A BIT OF CONFUSION? AND THAT'S THAT'S PROBABLY -- NOT FOR THE DEAL WELL MAYBE THE LA OFFICE. SO -- ALL THE DIFFERENT PIECES OF THE PLACEHOLDER PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT PIECES ARE JUST CURIOUS IF THERE WAS A PARTICULAR PIECE ABOUT THE AB FORTY SPECIFICALLY THE I'M SORRY THE WHAT THE WHAT AB FORTY RELATED. PIECE [inaudible] THE I'M SORRY I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH AB FORTY PIECE OKAY IT'S IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT. THERE. IS SOME INTENT LANGUAGE THAT MIGHT -- ATTEMPT TO PUT LIMITS ON INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE SALES OF VEHICLES. SO IS THIS THAT -- CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THAT YEAH SORRY -- SO THAT -- THERE IS. ONE POINT FIVE MILLION OF FUNDING FOR RESEARCH THAT WOULD GO TO THEIR RESOURCES BOARDS TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY -- TO MOVE THE STATE -- TO WERE ALL LIGHT LIGHT DUTYVEHICLES WOULD BE ZERO EMISSION AND SO THAT STRATEGY -- WOULD BE DUE TO BE COMPLETED AND AND PRESENTED TO THE LEGISLATURE BY JUNE THIRTIETH -- TWENTY TWENTY THAT WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY VERSION BUT NOT THE SENATE AND NOT IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL THAT'S CORRECT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MAN I'M SURE THIS IS THE DISCRETIONARY. EXPENDITURE PLAN WHAT IS THE NON DISCRETIONARY PLAN [inaudible] SO -- IF YOU'RE GONNA REFER TO THE TABLE ON PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT -- SO CAN I GET THE DIFFERENT PIECES OF THE OVERALL PACKAGE OF SPENDING -- AND SO THERE'S FOUR DIFFERENT PIECES ON THAT -- THE BIGGEST DOLLAR AMOUNT THERE IS THE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS SO AND CURRENTLY IN STATE LAW 60% OF ANNUAL REVENUE WILL AUTOMATICALLY GETS CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED TO CERTAIN PROGRAMS -- YOU KNOW HIGH SPEED INCLUDING HIGH SPEED RAIL AND VARIOUS TRANSPORTATION RELATED PROGRAMS -- THERE'S ALSO SOME SMALLER PIECES RELATED TO SOME ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN PREVIOUS YEARS -- WHERE FUNDING IS KIND OF AUTOMATICALLY ALLOCATED -- TO ALL SAID IN AN EXTENSION OR EXPANSION OF SALES TAX EXEMPTION -- PROVIDED TO OFFSET THE SUSPENSION -- THAT'S OUR AC SO THOSE ARE CATEGORIZED AS KIND OF OFF THE TOP BACK FILLS IN THAT CHART THAT YOU SEE. AND THEN FINALLY THERE'S JUST SOME RESOURCES -- FOR KIND OF ONGOING ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THAT AGENCIES WHICH HAVE BEEN CUT APPROVED IN PREVIOUS YEARS AND SO THEY ARE -- TYPICALLY CONSIDERED AN SORT OF THIS -- THIS A GENERAL DISCUSSION AROUND DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURES. THANK YOU MISTER BROWN BECAUSE I WOULD LOOK. AT THAT CLEAR TITLE WITH I CAN ASK MORE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. SO NOW THAT I KNOW OUR HIGH SPEED RAIL IS AT THE TAKES CARE OF THAT -- BUT THE SERMON OBERNOLTE. KIND OF ASKED THE QUESTION I WANTED TO ASK BUT MAYBE OVER FOR DO A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY -- PART IN THE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS. AS OUR FINING IN THERE FOR HARDENING ELECTRIC [inaudible] POWER LINES. NOT IN THE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS. SO WHERE IS IT IN THE DISCRETIONARY. IS IT JUST THE EIGHTEEN MILLION IN THE SENATE. OUR PROPOSAL WORDS AS WILD LINE WHILE DANCE BECAUSE WE URBAN INTERFACE AND OTHER. FIRE PREVENTION -- SO THERE'S A VARIETY OF PIECES RELATED KIND OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PREVENTION I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY OF THOSE KIND OF SPECIFIC PIECES INCLUDING MONEY SPECIFICALLY FOR KIND OF HARMONY IN. ELECTRICAL LINES -- THIS YEAR WE'RE FOCUSED ON WILDFIRES -- BUT FOCUSED AND PGA ANY AS A UTILITY WERE I MEAN THIS IS THE FOCUS AND HERE WE HAVE A REVENUE OPPORTUNITY. TO DO SOMETHING SO. IT DID IT'S BEEN THE EMPHASIS OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE NOT MAYBE THIS. ONE BUT THE PRIOR GOVERNOR OF OF ELECTRIFYING THIS STATE. AND IF WE'RE GONNA TRY TO GET EVERYONE TO DRIVE ELECTRIC CARS IN FOR GONNA TRY AND GET EVERYBODY TO DRIVE ELECTRIC TRUSTS. WHICH TAKES AN INCREDIBLE ELECTRICITY. TO TO CHARGE -- IT ANY OF THE UTILITY POWER LINES ARE CAUSING OUR WILDFIRES WHICH THEN CREATE THE GREENHOUSE GASES THAT WIPE OUT ALL THE EFFORTS. THAT YOU BENEFIT FROM FROM ELECTRIC CARS. IT SEEMS TO ME SOMEWHERE IN HERE WE SHOULD BE DOING SOMETHING TO TO PROTECT OUR GRADE BECAUSE WE HAVE. TO DEVELOP A LARGER STRONGER GRADE. TO TO USE MORE ELECTRICITY THE POWER ALL THESE. ELECTRIC CARS TYPE I AM I MISSING THE CONNECTION WHY ISN'T THE BUDGET PLAN. TRYING TO INCORPORATE WILDFIRES ELECTRICITY. UTILITIES. WHERE WHERE IS THE INTEGRATION AYE AYE AYE WHAT I'M MISSING? THIS CAP AND TRADE IS AN IS A NATURAL REVENUE SOURCE RIGHT. TWO MEN ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO AS PART OF THE ISSUE THAT YOU JUST HEARD ON AGENDA PAGE ELEVEN THE WILDFIRE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE -- THERE'S A COMPREHENSIVE PROPOSAL THAT HAS ADDITIONAL POSITIONS FOR BOTH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AS WELL AS CAL FIRE. OF THAT IMPLEMENTS THE REQUIREMENTS OF SB NINE A ONE WHICH IT REALLY FOCUSES ON WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MITIGATING THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH UTILITY CAUSED WILDFIRES AND THERE'S GOING TO BE ADDITIONAL REGULATORY. ACTIONS TAKEN AT THE PC RELATED TO THE UTILITY REQUIRED OF OFF AYE MITIGATION PLANS TO GET SET THIS THIS VERY THING SO IT IS JUST LIKE WITH WE TALK ABOUT CAO FIRES PORTFOLIO APPROACH OF ADDITIONAL ENGINES FIRE PREVENTION. AIR ATTACK OF THE WILDFIRE -- MITIGATION IS ALSO A PORTFOLIO APPROACH WHERE WE'RE PUTTING ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS ON UTILITIES -- WE'RE ENGAGING ADDITIONAL -- FORCED HEALTH -- INPUT OF ACTIONS THE RESULT IN A FEW REDUCTION AND FIRE PREVENTION AND AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE BEEFING UP OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPABILITY SO IT'S KIND OF AN ODD. ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH -- AND THERE WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL ISSUE WHEN YOU GET TO THE PC AS WELL RELATED TO THESE WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLANTS. SIX I GUESS WERE MISSING IT IS IS ON PAGE ELEVEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTEEN THOUSAND OF G. G. R. F.. FUNDS IN AND I'M I'M THINKING TO HARDEN THE ASSETS. I'M NOT THINKING OF LESS THAN A MILLION DOLLARS I'M THING AGAIN I THINK FEES OR I MEAN THESE ARE UTILITY -- ASSETS. RIGHT BUT THERE ARE FORCE. AND THERE ARE RESIDENTS. ATTENDED. THE SOMEHOW THERE'S GOTTA BE YOU KNOW WE'RE THE ONES THAT ARE MANDATING. THAT THEY THEY BUILD MORE POWER LINES TO DO WHAT WE WANT THEM TO DO THIS I THERE'S THERE'S GOTTA BE A COLLABORATION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR NIELSEN. IT REFERS HERE TO THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE. ANOTHER FIRE PREVENTION DOES THAT MEAN ONLY THE URBAN INTERFACE IN TERMS OF ASSESSING. I WOULD RATHER SEE THAT INCLUDED ALL WILD LANDS NOT JUST THE URBAN INTERFACE. BUT THESE FIRES. ORIGINATE. IN THE WILD LANDS NOT JUST AT THE URBAN INTERFACE LEVEL. ARE WE GOING TO BE ATTENDING TO THOSE OTHER LANDS IS THAT A PART OF THIS PLAN. YEAH SO -- THAT WAS KIND OF PART OF THE THE SENATE'S PACKAGE AND I BELIEVE THAT PEACE IN PARTICULAR WAS RELATED TO THINGS -- RELATED TO KIND OF SNOW DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND HOME HARDENING AND MAKING SURE THEY'RE CLEAR KIND OF EVACUATION ROUTES -- WHEREAS THERE THE OTHER SOME OF THE OTHER -- POTS OF MONEY PARTICULAR CALIFORNIA'S HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR WHICH IS KIND OF MORE GENERAL AND BROUGHT IT KIND OF THE LANDSCAPE LEVEL OF FORESTRY ACTIVITIES WHERE IS -- THAT WHILE IN URBAN AND A SPACES IS MORE ABOUT KIND OF LOOKING A THE PROTECTING -- HOMES IN THAT IN THAT INTERFACE AND EVACUATION ROUTES AND SOME WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ISSUES AS WELL. LET ME CLARIFY ANOTHER POINT RAISED THE IS THE LANGUAGE IN THERE ABOUT. PHASING OUT OR ELIMINATING. THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES SOME KIND OF STUDY FROM CARP TOWARDS THAT END. IS THAT A PART OF THIS AND ANYWAY. YES SO THERE IS MONEY FOR THEIR RESOURCES BOARD TO STUDY THAT ISSUE AND THEN REPORT BACK. TO IN THE ASSEMBLY VERSION EXCUSE ME SORRY. YEAH WELL I AS USUAL I THINK THEY'RE BOARD GET BETTER AHEAD OF ITSELF. ANOTHER [inaudible] MAYBE. KIND OF QUIET ITEM IN HERE BUT IS THERE LANGUAGE THAT SAYS FUNDING SHALL NOT BE ALLOCATED FOR THE PURCHASE OF FULLY AUTOMATED CALL AUTOMATED CARGO HANDLING. WHICH WOULD AFFECT OUR PORCH VERY SIGNIFICANTLY. IS THERE SUCH LANGUAGE. THE ASSEMBLY PLACE HOLDER OR PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE INCLUDES. A PROVISION ON THAT ISSUE AND WAS THERE ANY REASON GIVEN FOR THAT LANGUAGE. WE'LL SEE IF ANY OF OUR I KNOW WHY THE LANGUAGE IS THERE A WILL FIXING OF OURS IN THE COLLEAGUES CAN RESPOND -- AS WE GET TO THE LISTENER TO NIELSEN. ALL RIGHT WELL LET THAT COULD ALSO BE A LITTLE BIT OF A PROBLEM. AS FAR AS OUR PORTS ARE CONCERNED. IN THE ACCESS AND THE AMOUNT THAT WE CAN DELIVER FROM OUR PORTS [inaudible] YEAH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF A COUPLE ISSUES -- AND REYES -- THE SOME ON THE WRONG PAGE SEE. SO ON THE IF WE LOOK AT THE LA OWES REPORT -- PAGE TO WEAR IT -- BREAKS DOWN THE DIFFERENT ALLOCATIONS -- BY -- WITH THE GOVERNOR'S RECOMMENDING THE SENATE'S RECOMMENDING AND THEN THE ASSEMBLY AND I WAS WAS NOTED THE ASSEMBLIES. IS -- CATEGORY NOT SO MUCH BROKEN DOWN -- BUT ON THE LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION WHICH COVERS ARE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROJECT OUR AND CLEAN TRUCKS AND BUSES IN OFF ROAD IN VERY SAID THERE'S WE NOW KNOW THAT. WELL WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT IT IS OUR TRANSPORTATION VEHICLES THAT ARE THE LARGEST SOURCE FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BUT THEY'RE ALSO OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR TO AIR POLLUTION. AND SPECIFICALLY -- THE DIESEL POWERED THE PETROLEUM BASED DIESEL POWERED ARE FROM THE PARTICULAR MATTER POINT OF VIEW THE MOST SERIOUS ONE AND IF SO IF PART OF OUR OBJECTIVE IS NOT ONLY. TO GET OUT OUR CLIMATE PROTECTION GOALS BUT AS OUR AB THIRTY TWO LANGUAGE IN EVERY SUBSEQUENT WE ALSO INCORPORATE. THE AIR QUALITY. THE IT PUTS THEN. THE THE ROLE OF OUR CLEANING UP OR TRANSPORTATION FLEETS. NO PUTS OUT A PRETTY HIGH PRIORITY. AND WHAT AID IS BENNY CONTINUOUS -- SECOND OMINOUS SAY CONTINUES TWICE NO SORT OF AGGREGATION ME THAT WE DO NOT HAVE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION IN THOSE TWO CATEGORIES THAT WE WOULD THAT WE DON'T SEE THOSE AS ESSENTIAL THINGS THAT SHOULD BE IN CONTINUOUS PREPARATION NOW. THAT IS SOMETHING I THINK BOTH OF OUR HOUSES SHOULD ALWAYS SHOULD BE CONSIDERING FOR THE FUTURE -- BUT I APPRECIATE THE ASSEMBLY OVERALL INCREASE IN THAT CATEGORY AND WHILE THEY DIDN'T BREAK IT OUT. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE. AN INCREASE IN BOTH OVER THE WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S RECOMMENDING SO CLOSER TO THE SENATE FOR HIGHER. DEPENDING ON WHAT WE LAND. ON BOTH THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE. AND ON THE CLEAN TRUCKS AND BUSES THAT WHAT WE CALL THE HEAVY AND MEDIUM DUTY VEHICLES. AND ON THE CLEAN VEHICLES -- I THINK IT'S ALSO WORTH IT GIVEN THAT THERE'S MANY MORE ELECTRIC VEHICLES ON THE MARKET THEIR RANGES EXPANDING THAT WE LOOK AT INCREASING. THE WHAT THE RANGE MILEAGES FOR OUR REBATE PROGRAM RIGHT NOW IT'S AT TWENTY AND MILES IN WE MIGHT CONSIDER TWENTY FIVE OR SLIGHTLY HIGHER WE WOULD CAPTURE -- A GOOD AMOUNT OF THE VEHICLES THAT ARE ON THE MARKET BUT WE WOULD ALSO BE INCENTIVIZING THOSE THAT WERE REALLY GETTING. A GOOD -- I DO A GOOD INVESTMENT FOR IN TERMS OF RANGE IN SUCH -- BUT ON THE ON THE OFF ROAD WE'VE ALWAYS HAD IT AT A MUCH LOWER. OR RATHER IN THE THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY WE'VE ALWAYS FUNDED THAT AT A LOWER LEVEL THEN THE PASSENGER VEHICLE. AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO START MAKING IT ON PAR AND PART OF THAT IS THAT. THAT CATEGORY VEHICLES THEIR TURNOVER IS FASTER PASSED WE WE INDIVIDUALS DON'T BY PASSENGER VEHICLES VERY OFTEN SO WE GET FAR MORE BANG FOR OUR BUCK IF WE INCREASE OUR INVESTMENT. IN THE HEAVY MEDIUM DO DO THE VEHICLE -- REBATES AND INCENTIVES BECAUSE THE CHAIN CHANT DATE WE REPLACE THEM MORE FREQUENTLY SO WE'RE GOING TO GET. BETTER REDUCTION IN BOTH AIR POLLUTION AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTION IF WE FIND OUT POP BETTER. SO I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE CASE FOR MY PURPOSE IN SAYING ALL THAT WAS TO MAKE THE CASE FOR BOTH OF THOSE -- ADDITIONALLY -- THE HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM. WHAT THE RESEARCH NOW SHOWS IS THAT SOILS HAVE? A MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE THEN I OUR OUR FOR CLIMATE ACTION PLAN HAS NECESSARILY ACCOUNTED. FOR AND GIVEN THE THE RISE IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS NOT ONLY IN OUR STATE I MEAN WE'RE WE'VE. THEY'RE NOT. RISING TO THE LEVEL THAT. IN OTHER PLACES BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THINGS LIKE THE WILDFIRES IN OTHERS IT DOES. SET MUCH OF OUR GOOD WORK SO WHAT THIS REALLY TELLS US GLOBALLY IS THAT WE NEED. MORE THAN JUST DIRECT EMISSIONS REDUCTION WE NEED ALSO TO STRENGTHEN. THE THE CARBON -- STORAGE AND THAT'S OF COURSE IN OUR FORESTS IN OUR OCEANS. AND VARIOUS OTHER ARE CORAL REEFS BUT IT IS ALSO OUR SOILS AND THE HEALTHY SOILS RESEARCH SO FAR THE CARD TYPE OF PROJECTS WE FUNDED. HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT IT'S REALLY HAS A GREAT CAPACITY FOR CARBON STORAGE SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT -- THE SENATE VERSION IS IT THINK A HEALTHIER FUNDING LEVEL FOR THOSE HEALTHY SOILS -- AND IN THE TRANSFORMATIVE COMMUNITIES WHICH THE GOVERNOR'S -- RECOMMENDED I THINK. LET'S SEE IF I GET THAT RATE TRANSFERRED COMMUNITIES. IS HIGHER THAN EITHER OF OUR HOUSES -- NOT SURE WHAT THE DEBATE WAS IN OUR OUR TWO HOUSES MAYBE THE ASSEMBLIES BECAUSE IT DOESN'T BREAK IT DOWN IS MORE LIKE THE GOVERNOR'S. BUT I THINK THAT WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT -- SOME VERY GOOD WORK IN THE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED SO FAR BUT THE ONE NOTE IF WE DO. GO WITH FUNDING LEVEL OF THE SORT THAT THE GOVERNOR'S RECOMMENDING I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT WE EXPAND THE ELIGIBILITY FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS. TO THE TOP 15% OF CAL AND VIRUS SCREEN THE REASON I RAISE THAT IS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW YOU CAN IF YOU'RE IN THE TOP 25% YOU CAN APPLY. SO YOU CAN GET A PLAN GRANT BUT THEN OUR CURRENT FUNDING FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION IS. RESTRICTED ONLY TO THE TOP 5% SO BASICALLY WE'RE FINDING PEOPLE TO PLAN. THEY DO GREAT PLANS. REALLY GOOD PROJECTS AND THEN THEY CAN'T APPLY FOR MONEY TO IMPLEMENTED UNDER THE STRUCTURE WE'VE DEVELOPED SO I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT STRUCTURE FIXED -- AND THEN -- ON THE WASTE DIVERSION AND RECYCLING FOOD WASTE I THINK WE'VE RECOGNIZED. THAT INCREASINGLY FOOD WASTE SIMILAR TO YOU KNOW HEALTHY SOILS BEING A GREAT. CARBON STORAGE THAT FOOD WASTE IS A HIGHER IN MOREAND MORE SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF OUR METHANE EMISSIONS AND THAT THE MORE FOOD WASTE WE CAN. CAPTURE AN AND IN AFFECT EITHER COMPOST RECYCLE OR OR UTILIZED IN A WAY OTHER THAN IN THE LANDFILL WORK CREATES METHANE. THAT THAT IS A A GOOD USE THAN WHAT WE'VE SEEN NOW IS A LOT OF THE ENTITIES FOUR POINT TO THE MONEY. THAT IS IN THE FOOD WASTE CATEGORY THEY'RE ACTUALLY THEY'RE NOT JUST COMPOSTING IT THEY ARE GETTING THAT FOOD BACK OUT TO FOR NEEDED. THEY ARE TAKING -- FOR EXAMPLE OUT FROM FARMERS MARKETS FROM GROCERY STORES AND SUCH PRODUCE THAT IS BEEN DEEMED BY THE SELLER NOT TO BE STE SELLABLE BUT IS STILL. SAFE AND AN EDIBLE AND THEY'RE GETTING IT OUT TO WHETHER IT'S FOOD BANKS FOR OTHERS SO IT'S REALLY IT'S MEETING TWO VERY IMPORTANT GOALS ARE HUNGER CHALLENGES AS WELL AS OUR GREENHOUSE GAS CHALLENGES. SO I FEEL THAT THE SENATE'S -- LEVEL OF A REQUEST FOR THAT FOOD WASTE IS -- QUITE IS IS VERY JUSTIFIABLE -- AND THEN LASTLY I WANTED TO RAISE THAT WE WE DON'T HAVE AS FAR AS I CAN TELL IN OUR CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN. ANYTHING TO DEAL WITH. OUR EXISTING BANK OF REFRIGERANTS SO WE'RE TALKING NOW. THE H. CFCS BE -- THE SHORT. LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS. SENATOR LARA WHEN HE WAS SENATOR CARRIED A BILL ON THIS AND MADE IT A PRIORITY FOR CARP TO START LOOKING AT THESE VARIOUS SHORT LIVED POLLUTANTS. BUT THEY HAVE A VERY VERY HIGH GREENHOUSE GAS POTENTIAL. AND THE LATEST RESEARCH INDICATES THAT JUST RIGHT NOW UP AND DOWN STATE CALIFORNIA IN OUR EXISTING AIR CONDITIONERS IN OUR EXISTING REFRIGERATORS. MEANING BOTH COMMERCIAL AND HOUSEHOLD. THAT SITTING IN THOSE UNITS. IS ENOUGH OF THIS REFRIGERANT MATERIAL. THAT IF IT WERE TO BE RELEASED AT ONCE NOW YOU KNOW I KNOW IT'S HYPOTHETICAL IS NOT LIKELY BE RELEASED AT ONCE BUT JUST HEAR THE POINT. THAT IF IT WERE TO BE RELEASED AT ONCE. IT WOULD CREATE A GREATER GLOBAL WARMING. AT THE GREATER HIT ON OUR FULL CARBON -- CALCULATION THEN FROM ALL OTHER SOURCES IN ANY GIVEN YEAR IN CALIFORNIA. SO THIS IS STUFF THAT IF WE IF WE FOCUS ON HOW TO CAPTURE IT. INSTEAD OF ALLOWING IT. TO TO BE FUGITIVE EMISSIONS [inaudible] WE WOULD. WE WOULD DO A GREAT DEAL TO PROTECT OUR CLIMATE AND WE WOULD NOT IF WE JUST IGNORE IT SO I THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE THAT NEED ATTENTION AND IS NOT ANYWHERE IN ANYONE'S PLAN. SO JUST WANTED TO GET THOSE OUT OKAY. THANK YOU I DON'T WANT TO START ON TO A DEGREE WAS SENATOR SCARES COMMENTS AND THEN JUST ADD ADD SOME THINGS. ON IT IS GOING BACK TO LA -- AND FINANCE I THINK ONE OF OUR THE REASON OUR THERE ARE PROPOSAL PUT MORE MONEY TOWARDS LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION OBVIOUSLY. IS THE ONE AREA WHERE WE'RE NOT MAKING PROGRESS AND UNFORTUNATELY IT'S THE EVERYWHERE IF WE DON'T START TO TURN THINGS AROUND VERY QUICKLY WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MEET ALL OUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOAL START WITH THAT WE SET OUT ITS. 40% OF TIONS AND YOU'LL KNOW THAT 80% OF THE ADMISSIONS COMES FROM PASSENGER VEHICLE SO. GOING INTO THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM -- WAS CONCERNED BY THE REPORT THAT CAR PUT OUT SAYING THAT. EVEN IF WE APPROPRIATED THAT THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION WHICH IS THE THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT THEY MAY BE. OUT OF MONEY WITHIN THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THE FISCAL YEAR. SOMETIMES THE FIRST QUESTION THE THE OTHER QUESTION WAS ON SORT OF SORT OF GIVEN THAT RATHER THAN JUST GIVING. MONEY TO A INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT'S SORT OF NOT REALLY ANSWER PROGRESS MARK AND TITLE MY PROGRAM WHERE YOU JUST GET TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND HE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TODAY YOU GET TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS NEXT YEAR OR EVEN THE YEAR AFTER -- IN A RATHER THAN -- BAILING THAT PROGRAM OUT PER SE UNDER THE CURRENT STRUCTURE HAS THERE BEEN RETHINKING ABOUT SHOULD BE SURE WE KIND OF GO TO SEE THE R. P. TWO POINT NO ONE REALLY RETHINK. HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET TO OUR FIVE MILLION? A VEHICLE CALL CENTERS. YEAH SO ON ON YOUR FIRST POINT -- YET WE HAVE SEEN THOSE PROJECTIONS FROM CAR BUT I MEAN THERE'S YOU KNOW AND AS IN MANY CASES THERE'S KIND OF A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AND I THINK THIS KIND OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND. YEAH THE TESLA MODEL THREE ROLL OUT IN THE EXTENT TO WHICH SORT OF SNOW THAT WILL YOU KNOW THOSE HIGHER NUMBERS IN RECENT MONTHS MAYBE WILL CONTINUE BUT IT CERTAINLY -- AN ISSUE WORSE KIND OF FUEL CONSIDERING WHETHER OR NOT THEY THEY WILL HAVE ENOUGH MONEY OR KIND OF HOW MUCH MONEY WILL HELP IN THE IN THE UPCOMING YEAR AND THEN I GETS TO YOUR SECOND POINT I THINK IS YOU KNOW IT AND WE THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT. FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO BE CONSIDERING IT IS -- YOU KNOW HOW THAT PROGRAM SHOULD BE STRUCTURED GOING FORWARD AND IF THERE IS GOING TO BE THE SORT OF LOWER FUNDING AMOUNT THEN -- CARPAL LIKELY HAVE TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS PROGRAM AND THAT COULD BE IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS WHETHER IT BE. CHANGING THE INCOME CAPS CHANGING YOU KNOW WHICH CARS QUALIFY WERE VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS AND SO -- WE DO THINK IT'S AN IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER IT WHAT WHAT CHANGES CARDS IS CONSIDERING AND WHETHER OR NOT THOSE TYPES OF CHANGES ARE CONSISTENT WITH IT WITH THE LEGISLATORS PRIORITY IN ITS VISION FOR THE PROGRAM GOING FORWARD. THE TREES A CALORIE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK THAT LINED UP WITH THE EXPECTATION OF THE FUNDING THAT WAS PUT IN -- FOR THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION THAT THERE WOULD BE AN EXPECTATION THAT THOSE. FIVE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE REVISITED WHETHER IT'S INCOME LEVELS ARE OTHER. PARTS OF THE PROGRAM. I SEE SO SO WHO TOOK IT SO GIVEN THAT -- IT IS ASSUMING THAT WE WE WOULD PAY OUT. PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T PAID IN THIS FISCAL YEAR UNDER THE CURRENT CRITERIA WE WOULD DO THAT AND THEN POTENTIALLY UNDER THE NEW FISCAL YEAR HAVE TO REVISE OUR CRITERIA THAT. RIGHT AND IT I DON'T KNOW THAT IT WAS SPECIFIC TO AT WHAT POINT TO THOSE CRITERIA WOULD BE REVISITED BUT YES I THINK THAT TECHNICIAN WAS. THAT AS THE SALES ARE INCREASING -- GIVEN THE LEVEL OF MONEY THAT THOSE WOULD HAVE TO BE REVISITED AT SOME POINT. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU CAN IN WAS THERE -- WAS THERE A SENSE AND HOW LONG THE PROGRAM WOULD HAVE WOULD HAVE TO GO ON TO EXIST TO GET TO OUR FIVE MILLION VEHICLE GOAL LIKE LIKE ANY INCENTIVE PROGRAM AT SOME POINT THAT HAS. TO STOP I MEAN WE HAVE TO WHAT WE HAD A PARTICULAR GOAL WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO STOP IT. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT I THINK WE WERE ENVISIONING AT THE SIMILAR TO YOU KNOW SOLAR WHICH WAS YOU KNOW AND KIND OF THE BEGINNING AS YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCELERATE -- YOU WANTED TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES BUT THEN AS THE COMMERCIAL VIABILITY BECAME MORE REAL THAN THE NEED FOR THE SUBSIDY WOULD DECLINE. AND SO THE IDEA BEHIND THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION WAS IS THAT -- AS THE DEMAND WENT UP YOU COULD KIND OF FOCUS SAID IN TAYLOR IT MORE TOWARDS SAY THE LOW TO MIDDLE INCOME. EARNERS WHERE THE INCENTIVE HAS A GREATER MARGINALIZED THAT ON DECISION MAKING THAN SAY HIGHER INCOME AS AN AS AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE. NOW YOU ALSO MIGHT RECALL THAT LAST YEAR -- THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION HAD AGAIN A PORTFOLIO APPROACH WHERE IT WASN'T JUST REBATES BUT IT WAS ALSO AN INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT WHERE -- THROUGH AN ENERGY COMMISSION PROGRAM -- THEY WERE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN THEIR MISSION INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH HELPS. AGAIN IN THE CONSUMER DECISION MAKING PROCESS WHERE I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT RANGING SOCIETY. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN GET ADDITIONAL CHARGING STATIONS SPREAD OUT MORE THAT THEN -- CREATES -- MORE -- CONFIDENCE FROM THE CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE THAT THEY WOULD BE CHARGING STATIONS AVAILABLE IN MAKING THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES MORE VIABLE AND SO. WHAT I WOULD SAY THEN IS YOU KNOW THERE IS I THINK IT'S GO BIZ I HAS A -- KIND OF GROUP THAT CONTINUES TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES COLLABORATES WITH ENERGY COMMISSION AS WELL AS THEIR BOARD. AND WILL YOU KNOW -- THEIR BOARD OF COURSE -- CONTINUES TO JUSTICE PROGRAM YEAR BY YEAR BASED ON KIND OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY. IN THE COURSE WITH WITH RANGE ANXIETY PART OF THAT ARE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES FROM THE CAN DOWN A MAKERS. TO MAKE CARS THAT HAVE REAL RANGERS NOW THAT WERE WERE MOVING AWAY FROM COMPLIANCE CARS AND ACTUALLY. THEY'RE BUILDING WILL YOU KNOW REAL CARS WITH REAL RANGES OF TWO HUNDRED PLUS MILES I THINK THAT'S SLOWLY -- MOVED AWAY I THINK I THINK THE SOLAR EXAMPLES A GREAT EXAMPLE I THINK THE ONE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOLAR AND CV OUR P. WAS. THEY HAD AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT STARTED HIGH AND WENT TOWARDS ZERO AND RATCHET DOWN BASED ON VOLUME SO ACTUALLY CRY THINK IT CREATED. MILESTONES AND TARGETS THAT WERE HIT ALONG THE WAY AND THAT'S WHAT WOULD TRIGGER THE LOWER -- INCENTIVE. SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE. CONSIDERING AS WELL AS TAKING A HARDER LOOK AT RATHER THAN JUST HAVING A STRAIGHT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR IN ENTITLEMENT. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU MANAGER. FOCUSING ON THE WORK FORCE TRAINING PIECE AND I KNOW YOU SAID IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO GOVERNOR BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS I MEAN FIRST OF ALL. I'M SORT OF ONE WHO WEEK TEND TO USE THIS GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND IS A BANK. FROM TIME TO TIME AND I DO THINK THAT THE SINCE PEOPLE ARE PAYING FOR THIS. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN. DO SO THE MONEY THAT WE SHOW ABOUT THE DOOR NEEDS SHOULD BE DIRECTLY RELATED TO GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION. FOR THAT REASON I'M SORT OF SENSITIVE TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM YOUR VALLEY SAID IN HIS COMMENTS ABOUT DIESEL ENGINE REPLACEMENT A VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS MAYBE WE SHOULD. BEFORE MOVING THIS MONEY IN THAT DIRECTION WHERE THERE'S A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN THE EXPENDITURE. AND THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION BUT THE QUESTION [inaudible] WORKFORCE TRAINING. HOW MUCH MONEY FLOWS TO THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH WE OWE A? FOR TRAINING EVERY YEAR AND ONE AND TWO WHY DON'T WE TAKE THIS THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE THE WE OWE MONEY THAT COMES TO THE STATE THAT IS THEN DISTRIBUTED DOWN [inaudible] TO VARIOUS REGIONS. SO I CAN SPEAK BRIEFLY ABOUT THE SECOND QUESTION AND THEN A COLLEAGUE OF MINE CAN SPEAK TO THE FIRST SO I THINK. FOR THIS THE ADMINISTRATION UNDERSTANDS AND IS ALWAYS ON THE PROPOSAL THAT IT PRESENTS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET MAY REVISION VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THE USES OF THIS MONEY WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S FOR A SPECIFIC. PURPOSE WE TO BELIEVE THAT THIS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AS DESCRIBED IS ALIGNED WITH THAT PURPOSE IT'S NOT A GENERAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS IT'S NOT NECESSARILY OPEN TO EVERYONE SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON THOSE PEOPLE IN THOSE AREAS. THAT ARE TRANSITIONING -- TO A LOW CARBON ECONOMY AND SEVEN THAT SENSE WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS VERY MUCH ALIGNED WITH THE GOALS OF THIS PROGRAM WHAT WHAT IS I MEAN I'M NOT I DID SIT ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND GENERALLY DON'T TOUCH CAP AND TRADE VERY MUCH UNLESS WE HAVE TO VOTE. WHAT WHAT WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN THOUGH TRANSITIONING TO A LOW? WOULD YOU SAY LOW. OF A CARBON LOW CARBON ECONOMY WHAT DOES IT REALLY MEAN IN TERMS OF JOB TRAINING I MEAN WE TRAINING. SOLAR TECHNICIANS WHAT ARE WE DOING RIGHT TO AND THAT THE ME REVISION PROPOSAL THE THIRTY FIVE MINUTE. MILLION DOLLARS WAS TO SUPPORT THEM HIGH QUALITY SKILLED JOBS ACROSS A LOT OF AREAS OF GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND INVESTMENTS. M.. LOOK WHO I AM MAKE SURE THAT THE JOBS THAT ARE RELATED TO REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS ARE DONE BY WELL TRAINED WELL PAID WORKERS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE THE BENEFITS FROM THOSE PROGRAMS BY HAVING THAT HIGHS HIGHLY SKILLED. TRAINED JOB FORCE. WHAT WE LIKE THOSE WE LIKE THAT CONCEPT -- WHERE I COME FROM I'M JUST RYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY IT'S COMING OUT OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND? AS OPPOSED TO WHAT I WHAT I SUSPECT IS A FAIRLY ROBUST AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT FLOWS TO THE STATE FOR WORKFORCE TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT. RIGHT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING UP AND TRYING TO GET THAT THE ANSWER TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION ABOUT HOW MUCH COMES INTO THE WE ARE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FOR THIS AND YOU'RE RIGHT THERE ARE OTHER WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS THIS ONE IS PARTICULAR TO I AM GETTING THAT SKILLED WORKFORCE OUT THERE IN. IN ADVANCING OUR GHG EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE WORKERS ARE THERE SO THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE OUR GREENHOUSE GAS. EMISSION REDUCTION TARGETS. I'M NOT BEING CRITICAL I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THE ADMINISTRATION'S OBJECTIVES HERE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND AND WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING WITH THE MONEY THEY WERE COLLECTING FOR A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE AROUND THE STATE. TO ADD ON TO SENATOR RUSS POINT CAN YOU GIVE EXAMPLES OF THE KINDS OF JOBS THAT THIS PART OF MONEY WOULD TRAIN. FOR MAYBE THAT WOULD HELP US UNDERSTAND IT WOULD DIFFERENTIATE FROM THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. BROADER TRAINING THE DANIEL BRENDA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A CENTER NIELSEN TO YOUR QUESTION THE STATE RECEIVED ABOUT THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS. I'M SORRY SENATOR OFTEN FOR YOU. MY HAVE. CHEESE. ENGINE EIGHTY ONE POINT TWO MILLION FOR THE MAY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN REVISED OF WHICH ONLY FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND IS DISCRETIONARY AND THOSE FUNDS ARE USED TO THE FOR THOSE PROGRAMS EXISTING PROGRAMS IN THE WORK FORCE DATA ARENA AND STOPPING THOSE. ALLY C. SO. SO FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND IS DISCRETIONARY SO THIS MILLION FIFTY SEVEN MILLION IS DISCRETIONARY I SEE. WHEN AT ONE OF THE TWO THOUSAND AND ONE OF THE CATEGORIES WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT IS -- IS THAT THE CONSTRUCTION. INDUSTRY WE'VE ALSO TALKED ABOUT LOOKING AT A FOCUS ON WORKFORCE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND REGIONS THAT HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN MORE DEPENDENT ON FOSSIL FUELS IT'S ALSO REGIONAL APPROACH IN ADDITION TO KIND OF THE THE SPECIFIC TRAITS -- MAYES FOLLOWED BY THREE TO NIELSEN. I'LL BE QUICK MADAM CHAIR -- AND THEN I WANT TO JUST BOB. MAYBE TALK A LITTLE ABOUT WHAT MY IN THE LAST THREE OF MY COLLEAGUES -- HAVE HAVE SPOKEN -- SENATOR SKINNER IS ABSOLUTELY ACCURATE WHEN SHE SAID THAT BY THIS POINT TO REDUCE OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WE HAVE. TO DEAL WITH THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR WHICH IS WHY I'VE BEEN ARGUING FOR OF THE FOR THE FARMER PROGRAM INCREASING THAT THAT NUMBER. WE KNOW THAT MOM CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL. I DON'T KNOW WHY WE HAVE TO SAY THAT ANYMORE IN FACT THAT'S THE THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS ARE STILL A FEW OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE RIGHT NATIONALLY THAT -- THAT'S A BIG DEAL WHEN THEY SAY CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL BUT THE FACTS ARE THE FACTS -- ARE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS HAVE BEEN CONTINUE TO RISE AT THE SAME TIME GLOBAL TEMPERATURES ARE RISING THE POINT OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM -- WAS TO BE ABLE TO USE THE MARKET MECHANISM TO REDUCE THOSE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS -- OVER THE OVER TIME THE REALITY IS THE FUNDS THAT WE RECEIVE THROUGH THE SELLING OF THOSE ALLOWANCES IS REALLY JUST A BY PRODUCT IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THE POINT OF IT. TOM IT'S A BY PRODUCT. BUT TO MINE -- TO CENTER RAS POINT -- HE'S EXACTLY RIGHT THAT THERE SHOULD BE A CONNECTION BETWEEN THOSE DOLLARS THAT ARE RECEIVED TO ACTUALLY REDUCING THOSE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS YOU GET A BANG. YOU KNOW YOU GET TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE WANT ONE STONE. SO BACK TO THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL AND AND THIS IS WHY I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF ARE NOT SUPPORTIVE OF A BECAUSE THE AND IN IT I HAVE ANOTHER. SHEET HERE THAT ACTUALLY SHOWS THE LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION WAS SIX HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION. AND CLIMATE SMART BAG WAS FORTY FIVE MINUTE THINK THAT FORTY FIVE MILLION MIGHT BE THE FARMER PROGRAM. BUT IT'S SEPARATE OUT DIFFERENTLY THAN THE SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION I'M WONDERING IF IF THE GOAL OF THAT SIX HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION WAS -- FOR WHAT WHAT WAS TO INCREASE THAT THAT NUMBER -- BUT BECAUSE OUR GOAL SHOULD BE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR TO BILL TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS -- AND I DON'T KNOW IF -- IF ANY WOULD IF YOU GUYS CAN CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION -- AND IF IF THAT WAS THE CASE WE CAN INCREASE THE FORMER PROGRAM AND DO MORE INCENTIVES TO BE ABLE TO THE DIRT THAT HAVE NEW VEHICLES THAT ACTUALLY REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS I MUSED SUPPORTER OF THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL -- SO I I THINK PART OF THE ISSUE MIGHT JUST BE KIND OF KIND OF HOW THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS ARE CATEGORIZED IN I THINK THIS GETS TO YOUR POINT LEAD AT LEAST PARTIALLY -- SO YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THE ASSEMBLY PLAN WHICH INCLUDES -- SOME MORE MONEY FOR LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION -- IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THAT PACKAGE COULD INCLUDE. THINGS THAT THAT THE FOR LIKE THE FARMER PROGRAM -- AT YOU KNOW WHICH IT WHICH PROVIDE SOME INCENTIVE FUNDING FOR YOUNG -- TRANSPORTATION RELATED EMISSIONS RELATED TO AGRICULTURE AND SO -- PART OF BY THINK PART OF JUST KIND OF THINKING ABOUT THESE PACKAGES IS KIND OF YOU KNOW ONE JUST KIND OF THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU KIND OF CATEGORIZE THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS WHICH I THINK COULD KIND OF FALL UNDER. JUST BE CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE CATEGORY OR IT COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE THE FORMER PROGRAM COULD BE FUNDED OUT OF THE THE LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION PART AS WELL. SHOULD WE BE ASSIGNING WHAT THOSE DOLLARS ARE GOING FOR ITS IT IS SAYING IT'S FOR ALL SIX HUNDRED AND I'M SIX AND SIXTY NOT ANYTHING SHE WOULD BE ASSIGNING -- WHAT WHAT THE THAT THAT MONEY SHOULD GO TOWARDS? I I MEAN I I THINK CERTAINLY FOR LEGISLATURE KIND OF HAS PRIORITIES ON WHICH PROGRAMS IT THINKS ACCOMPLISHES ITS GOALS MOST EFFECTIVELY -- AND IT'S KIND OF CONSISTENT WITH ITS PRIORITIES WHETHER IT BE KIND OF GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS OR LOCAL AIR POLLUTION REDUCTIONS THAN. SPECIFYING THAT -- IN KIND OF THE ALLOCATIONS AND PROVIDING IT TO THOSE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS WE THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA RATHER THAN YOU KNOW GIVEN MORE DISCRETION TO THE ADMINISTRATION OKAY AND AND THEN FINALLY A MANAGER JUST WANTED ALSO. ECHO SOME MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS IT SEEMS INAPPROPRIATE TO DO WORKFORCE TRAINING -- THAT THIRTY FIVE MILLION IS AN AWFUL LOT OF MONEY SEEMS NAPPROPRIATE TO BE USING TO G. R. F. MONEY. FOR WORKFORCE TRAINING A BIG FAN OF WORKFORCE TRAINING WE NEED MORE OF IT NOT LESS OF IT BUT TO USE YEAR AFTER HOURS TO DO SO I THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU ARE CENTER NIELSEN WHO WILL BE FOLLOWED BY MR MCCARTY SINCE NIELSEN. SPEAKING OF THE SOILS. MY COLLEAGUE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE THE SWELLS AND THAT IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. THESE CATACLYSMIC FIRES. A VERY HARMFUL TO OUR SOILS. THEY STERILIZE. SOME OF THE LANDS THE HE GETS SO HOT. THAT THAT LAND WILL BE STERILE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. SO WHAT IS THE PREMIUM THERE IT IS. MAINTAINING AND CLEANING UP OUR FORCES IN AWHILE LANDS IN OUR URBAN INTERFACE. THE LAST TWO ADMINISTRATIONS INCLUDING THIS ONE HAVE BEEN GOOD ABOUT FINALLY AFTER DECADES ATTENDING TO THIS AREA ARE PAYING SOME ATTENTION TO IT. BUT AS WE LOOK AT THIS CAP AND TRADE I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT IT'S SUFFICIENT [inaudible] EVEN NOW. AND YOU DO NOT COMPARE IT WITH THE POLLUTION. THAT THESE FIRES. THEY HAVE CREATED. IMPOSED ON US. SO WE DO NEED TO GET THE FIRES UNDER CONTROL AND UNDER CONTROL MEANS MANAGING OUR FORCE AND WHILE LANCE SOME OF IT GETS BACK TO THE KIND OF PLANES THAT WE PUT THE FIRES OUT BUT MOSTLY IT'S PREVENTION THAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON IT I'D LIKE TO SEE. A LOT MORE ATTENTION EVEN IN THIS BUDGET TOWARDS THAT END. WHERE DO WOOD AND AND I WOULD SEE THIS TO BE A IT'S GOT TO BE A DECADES OF SUSTAINED EFFORT? IS THE ADMINISTRATION. REALIZING AND DIRECTING ITS ENERGIES TOWARDS THAT SUSTAINED PROGRAM OF DIMINISHING. THESE GREAT ACCUMULATIONS. A FUEL SUPPLIES OF THEM WE COULDN'T AGREE MORE THAT THE WE WE MIGHT RECALL SB NINE NO ONE WHICH THE CAP AND TRADE PACKAGE. SUPPORTS WAS ACTUALLY NOT JUST TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN NINETEEN TWENTY BUT IT WAS A MULTI YEAR COMMITMENT AND IS ACTUALLY A BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. TO GET TO THE VERY ISSUE THE THAT YOU'RE RAISING AND SO I THINK ONE OF THE IT IS SOMETIMES IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONTEXTUALIZE OF THE THE PACKAGES ACCURATE. AS THE NUMBERS ARE FOR THE LA DOES IT DOES REFLECT JUST KIND OF A ONE YEAR SNAPSHOT -- BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH SAID THERE ARE A COUPLE PROGRAM CATEGORY SUCH AS A HEALTHY FORCE THAT ACTUALLY WE SELECT A MULTI YEAR COMMITMENT WHERE'S MY IN SOME OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS ARE MORE ON A ON A ONE TIME BASIS SO -- GETTING YOUR POINT IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL INVESTMENT THE OVERALL COMMITMENT GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SITUATION IT IS A BILLION DOLLARS OVER FIVE YEARS. TOWARDS THAT END IN PART. IS A NEED TO FOCUS ON CO GENERATION CAPACITY. THESE FUELS NEED TO GO SOMEWHERE. AND OVER DECADES WE HAVE. PRETTY MUCH DIMINISH THE TIMBER INDUSTRY SO GETTING RID OF LARGE TREES AND LOGS. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT NOW. AND WE HAVE NOT ENCOURAGED IN FACT WE DISCOURAGE COGENERATION. WHICH CREATES A CAPACITY TO REMOVE SOME OF THESE PORTION WHILE AND FUELS. THAT IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE A PART OF THE FUTURE THAT'S NOT A PART OF ANYTHING HERE BUT THAT DOES NEED TO BE A PART OF OUR DIALOGUE AS WE PROCEED. SO MARK ME AS YET CONCERNED ABOUT HOW FAR WE'RE GOING AND HOW MUCH FURTHER WE NEED TO GO. AND BIG RUPEE I COMPLIED WITH OTHER THINGS TOO THAT CONTRIBUTE TO POLLUTION. BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THESE FIRES REGULAR [inaudible] IN MY MR MCCARTY. YES THANK YOU -- YOU KNOW CAP AND TRADE IS A POPULAR TOPIC BY WE SPENT. AN HOUR HERE RIGHT NOW THAT'S WHY LEADERS DOZENS OF BILLS INTRODUCED EVERY YEAR CAPTERRA BUT HE HAS AN IDEA. THIS KIND OF IS IS IS THE P. BANK SO -- THAT I'D LIKE TO ONE DAY HAVE A CONVERSATION LIKE MR MORE LIKE SAID ABOUT THE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION NUMBER OF TALKING ABOUT. BUT 40% RIGHT HERE. THERE ARE 60% THERE'S BIG PROJECTS THERE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE HELPING. WITH WHAT OUR ULTIMATE GOALS ARE TRYING. TO ADDRESS OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT IN CLIMATE CHANGE AND SO. I GUESS WE'LL HAVE A DISCUSSION. NEXT YEAR IS THAT ACCURATE. ON THAT. ON THE CONTINUOUS FEES -- HIGH I MEAN BUT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE THINK THE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD HAVE THAT DISCUSSION ANYTIME WE WOULD LIKE ON KIND OF ON LIKE ON THE CONTINUES APPROPRIATIONS AS WELL AS THE DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURES AND KIND OF WHERE IT WHAT IT'S PRIORITIES ARE. IT DOESN'T COME UP NEXT YEAR. CONTINUOUS THE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS ARE JUST ARE CURRENTLY IN LAW THERE IS NO SUNSET DATE ON THE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS FACTION. BUT THE BIG THING IS IS I I WANT I CAN KERR WITH WHAT -- CURTAIN SPECIALLY CENTER SKINNER SUMMER TING AND IF YOU LOOK AT OUR CHALLENGE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S REALLY FOCUSED ON ON MOBILE. SOURCES AND I THINK WE SHOULD FOCUS OUR RESOURCES. THERE -- CAN I AM I AM ALL IN IT LOOKING AT YOU KNOW THE AUTOMOBILE ISSUE AND FOCUSING ON HAVING CLEANER. PASSENGER CARS -- AS AS WELL AS INDUSTRIAL INCLUDING AG CAR CARS BUT IT'S NOT JUST ALWAYS THAT THE REBATE PROGRAMS BUT IT'S THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO I KNOW THAT -- MISTER TEENS TALKING ABOUT THAT FOR EXAMPLE I'M GOING TO THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION IF YOU ARE LIKE MANY OF US WE HAVE ELECTRIC VEHICLE DRIVING THERE. I'M NOT SURE IN A PARK IN TURGID THAT'S THAT'S MY CHALLENGER KNOCKS THE DAD'S. A RANGE OF TWO HUNDRED MILES THAT'S JUST ABOUT THE DISTANCE AND SO. THOSE ISSUES ARE REAL NOT JUST -- THE REMAINS SO I THINK THAT WE NEED. TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND UNDERSTAND FROM WE TALKED EARLIER FROM THE FROM THE FINANCE FOREST'S COMPARISONS. TO THE SOLAR INDUSTRY AND INCENTIVIZE AND JUMP START -- THIS ANTI AND BUT WE DO HAVE THAT -- THE MONEY IN THERE FOR A ARE BE TO DO THE RESEARCH ON THE INDUSTRY AND COURSE THERE'S ISSUES ON BATTERIES AND SO FORTH BUT FROM THE LA -- WHAT WHAT OTHER? WHAT ELSE YOU WOULD BE DOING TO IT IF WE ARE TO GET TO THIS MAGICAL? CALL WHICH IS THE LOFTY AT A FIVE MILLION CLEAN VEHICLES IN CALIFORNIA. IS PLUGGING ALONG AT THIS IS THIS ADEQUATE THIS GOING TO GET US THERE WERE WHAT ELSE -- SHOULD BE DOING OTHER THINGS WE OUGHT TO BE TAKING A LOOK AT I MEAN I I THINK THAT'S A GOOD AND AND DIFFICULT QUESTION AS THERE IS -- THE STATE I THINK IS ALREADY DOING QUITE A BIT SO WE HAVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT PROGRAMS I MEAN ON IN THIS PACKAGE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROJECT AND KIND OF YOU KNOW THE INCENTIVES THAT ARE PROVIDED THROUGH THAT -- NO STATE HAS OTHER PROGRAMS TO AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM WAS MENTIONED EARLIER -- FOR THE EASY CHARGING -- YOUR CARD HAS A A REGULATION THAT REQUIRES -- MANY FACTORS TO PRODUCE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. THE STATE HAS A LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD PROGRAM WHICH YOU KNOW INTO PROVIDING SOME SUBSIDIES -- FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AS WELL SO THERE THERE'S KIND OF A A SUITE OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW -- THAT ARE ARE ARE MEANT TO ENCOURAGE. YOU ADOPTION OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES I THINK THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT. THAT'S ENOUGH I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN SORT OF AN ANALYSIS OF OF WHAT EXACTLY WOULD BE NEEDED TO KNOW WHAT WE WOULD NEED TO PROVIDE IN TERMS OF INCENTIVES OR OR OTHER PROGRAMS TO KIND OF ACTUALLY HIT THAT GOAL -- SO AT YOU KNOW IT I THINK THEY'RE KIND OF MORE WORK TO BE DONE AND KIND OF THINKING THROUGH YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT LEVELS OF FUNDING MIGHT BE NEEDED FOR EXAMPLE. EIGHT SEVEN OTHER PROGRAMS HE HERE IF WE PUT IT ALL TO THAT FOR EXAMPLE IN THEM. HELLO CARBON TRANSPORTATION FUND FOR TWO YEARS YOU KNOW WOULD THAT GET US TO A POINT WHERE WE GET. TO DEFINE ON FIVE MILLION CARS OR YOU SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT KNOWING THAT THIS IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST FACTOR WE NEED TO ADDRESS. I MEAN I THINK. YOU KNOW IT'S JUST THIS PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO THAT PROGRAM IS IS ONE OPTION WORTH CONSIDERING AND I THINK THAT JUST THE THE JUST TO POINT THESE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WOULD PROVIDE VALUABLE BENEFITS WOULDN'T GET THAT MONEY BUT I THINK THINKING BIG. AND BIG PICTURE ABOUT KIND OF WHAT THE STATE'S ROLE IS AN REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND HOW THE STATE CAN KIND OF YOU KNOW ADOPTED POLICIES OR PUSH TECHNOLOGIES WHICH THEN CAN BE KIND OF EXPORTED TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND YOU MAY BE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES IS KIND OF ONE OF THOSE. EXAMPLES IN KIND OF THINKING ABOUT HOW THE STATE CAN -- CAN KIND OF PUSH THOSE TECHNOLOGIES FORWARD AS IT IS ONE OF VERY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION AND CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT KIND OF HOW IT COULD DO THAT MOST EFFECTIVELY BUT AS FAR AS TO HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD BE NEEDED TO DO THAT. AND AND WHAT'S NEEDED TO KIND OF MEET THAT FIVE MILLION -- SAID OF GOAL -- WE'RE NOT AWARE OF ANY KIND OF PARTICULAR ANALYSIS ON ON THOSE ON THOSE NUMBERS THANK YOU. MR MCCARTY SENATOR SKINNER ONCE YOU KNOW THAT SERVICES WILL NOT TWO HUNDRED MILES AWAY. MISTER KING JUST SEND YOU A LINK SO YOU'LL KNOW WHERE TO PLUG IN FOR SAN FRANCISCO SEE LONGEST RANDY. THIS IS YOUR CONFERENCE COMMITTEE TAKING CARE OF YOU. ROUND TRIP YET THEY GOT YOU THEY GOT YOU HE JUST SEND YOU THE LINK FEEL NO WHERE TO PLUG IN. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON THIS. VERY MEATY CRITICAL ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEEDLESS TO SAY WILL BE HOLDING THIS ITEM OPEN [inaudible] THANK YOU. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE. THIRTEEN ANOTHER ME THE ISSUE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. LA -- HAS PREPARED -- A DOCUMENT FOREST'S AND WHEN THEY'RE READY THEY CAN BEGIN TO WALK US THROUGH IT. AGAIN ISSUE. THIRTEEN JOHN MY RENTAL LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND I WILL BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT THAT HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE IT YOUR BINDERS UP THERE. IF NOT THE SERGEANT HAS COPIES. SO THAT -- GOVERNOR PROPOSES TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ESTABLISH A SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM TO INCREASE SAFE DRINKING WATER -- ACCESS TO CALIFORNIANS. THE LEGISLATION WOULD ESTABLISH A SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUND. AND PRIORITIZE USE THE FUNDS TO CSUS DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS THERE SIR BY WATER SYSTEMS THAT DO NOT PROVIDE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES VARIOUS CHARGES ESTIMATED TO GENERATE ROUGHLY A HUNDRED TWENTY SIX TWO HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION ANNUALLY WHEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED -- TO FUND THE NEW PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES MONTHLY CHARGES ON WATER SYSTEM CUSTOMERS TO INCREASE FERTILIZER MIL FEES -- TO GENERATE REVENUES OF SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY MILLION ANNUALLY. IMPOSES CHARGES ON MILK PRODUCERS ESTIMATED TO GENERATE FIVE MILLION ANNUALLY AND ALSO IMPOSE CHARGES ON CONFINED ANIMAL FILL FACILITIES THE CIVIC FLUIDS DAIRIES -- AND THIS WOULD GENERATE UP TO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ANNUALLY. THE GOVERNOR ALSO PROPOSES FOUR POINT NINE MILLION AND ONE TIME GENERAL FUND SUPPORT AND THIRTY POSITIONS FOR THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AGRICULTURE FOR STATE ADMINISTRATION -- AND TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM IF YOU TURN THE PAGE -- YOU'LL SEE THAT THE SENATE REJECTED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND I DROPPED THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE LEGISLATION TO CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND -- DEFINED THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FIND IN ITS CONTINGENT ON ENACTMENT OF THE SENATE BILL. TWO HUNDRED WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH THAT SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUND TO HELP WATER SYSTEMS PROVIDING ADEQUATE AND AFFORDABLE SUPPLIES SAFE DRINKING WATER. THE ASSEMBLY SET ASIDE FOUR POINT NINE MILLION GENERAL FUND PENDING FUTURE AGREEMENT ON THE ESTABLISHMENT THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM. AND DEFERRED ACTION ON THE CREATION OF THE PROGRAM IN THE FOR THE ISSUE TO THE LEGISLATIVE -- POLICY COMMITTEES FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION. SO WE WE NOTE THAT BOTH HOUSES HAVE SHOWN CONSISTENT INTEREST IN MOVING FORWARD. ON THE POLICY TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO CLEAN AFFORDABLE ACCESSIBLE DRINKING WATER AT ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND THEY'RE CURRENTLY BILLS IN BOTH HOUSES THAT WOULD IMPLEMENT PROGRAM SIMILAR TO WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR. WE HAVE LOOKED AT ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES FOR THE THE PROGRAM A SPECIFIC WILLIE WE'VE LOOKED AT BOND FINDING BUT WE DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. BECAUSE BOND PROVIDE ONE TIME FIND SOURCES AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED ON AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR AN ONGOING PROGRAM -- AND ALSO WE LOOKED AT SPECIAL FUNDS HOWEVER WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY SPECIAL FUND WHERE IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO USE THE FUNDS FOR THESE PURPOSES. AND IT ALSO HAS A SUFFICIENT BALLOTS THAT IT COULD PAY FOR THE PROGRAM -- WHEN ALTERNATIVE THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT IS THE GENERAL FUND AND WE THINK THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE -- FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE PROGRAM. WE WOULD NOTE THAT -- HISTORICALLY WE'VE HAD CONCERNS ABOUT CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS BECAUSE THEY TEND TO CONSTRAIN LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT HOWEVER IF THE LEGISLATURE DID. CHOOSE TO GO THIS ROUTE. THERE ARE SOME OPTIONS THAT COULD HELP WITH OVERSIGHT AND FUTURE FOR EXAMPLE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S HEAR FROM FINANCE. TO BRIEF COMMENTS FIRST THE GOVERNOR CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED A DEDICATED ONGOING SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. AND THE SECOND IN IS MAY REVISION PRESS CONFERENCE THE GOVERNOR EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU TO FIND WHERE THAT ONGOING SOURCE CAN BE WE CONTINUE TO STAND BEHIND OUR MAY REVISION PROPOSAL BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A ONGOING CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS INDEED QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS MR OBERNOLTE. SO I WOULD HOPE I SPEAK FOR EVERYONE ON THIS DÃ­AS THAT. WE ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE WE NEED TO PROVIDE CLEAR AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER TO CALIFORNIANS AND THE TO THE EXTENT THAT THEIR PLACES IN THE STATE WHERE THE DOES NOT OCCUR. I SHOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR US. BUT WE DON'T WERE RIGHT NOW IN HERE WHEN WE'RE PROJECTING A TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS AND THAT'S WHY SHE IS SO DIFFICULT. TO TALK ABOUT IMPOSING NEW TAXES ON CALIFORNIANS. I THINK THE SITUATION MIGHT BE DIFFERENT IF. WE WERE. HEY FACING A DEFICIT AND WE WERE HAVING OF CUT OTHER -- OTHER PLACES BUT WHICH IS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR US TO GO BACK TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND EXPLAIN TO THEM WHY. WE HAD TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS EXTRA AND YET WE ELECTED TO ADD A TAX -- AND THE OTHER THING I WANT TO SAY ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS THAT THIS THE TAX AND PARTICULARLY THE TAX ON THE COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS. WHICH IS THE BULK OF THE REVENUE. IT'S IT'S A PARTICULARLY REGRESSIVE TAX MEANING THAT IT'S DISPROPORTIONATELY BORNE BY THE PEOPLE WHO CAN LEAST AFFORD TO PAY AT THE ONE WHEN WE ENACT THOSE KIND OF TAXES INVARIABLY WHAT WE'RE DOING IS RAISING THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT I THINK A LOT OF US HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BECAUSE MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE ALREADY FACING CHALLENGES. IN AFFORDING THEIR BASIC NECESSITIES AND OF WHICH WATER IS ONE OF THEM SO -- I I'M REALLY HOPING THAT WE CAN COME. TO SOME KIND OF AGREEMENT THAT WERE WE FIND A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO FUND THIS ON THE GENERAL FUND SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO IMPOSE THAT TAX. ON CALIFORNIANS BECAUSE IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO JUSTIFY. THANK YOU MISTER TING. THANKS I MEAN I I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE PAIR THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO PROVIDE CLEAN AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FOR EVERYBODY IN THE STATE AND FACT I'M. SORT OF LITTLE BIT SHOCKED THAT SIX YEARS AFTER BEING UP HERE WE DOES MY SEVENTY WE HAVEN'T DONE IT YET -- HAVING SAID THAT YOU KNOW AS WELL NO. ONCE WE WAIT AND TELL WATER ISSUES ISSUES ARE. THEM MOST COMPLEX IN THE STATE I DON'T THINK THERE'S AN ISSUE THAT'S MORE COMPLEX OR MORE CHALLENGING THE STATE THAN WATER. HAVING SAID THAT THE THE WATER WASN'T POLLUTED BY. THE ENVIRONMENT OR BY NATURE THE WATER WAS POLLUTED BY. PEOPLE. AND I THINK THAT THE BIG THE BIG CHALLENGES I THINK THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE. IS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS REMEDIATION. DONE BY THE PEOPLE IN THE ENTITIES THAT. CREATED THE POLLUTION I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES ON IS THAT MAKING SURE THAT AGAIN. WITH MUCH OF OUR REMEDIATION WHICH HAS BEEN A LONG LONG TIME DISCUSSING CAP AND TRADE THAT THERE ACTUALLY IS -- ENSURING THAT THERE'S ADEQUATE. MEDIATION BY THE POLLUTERS WHO BECAUSE THE POLLUTION WHO POLLUTED DRINKING WATER WHO MADE IT SO THAT THE WATER WAS NOT DRINKABLE THE WATER DID NOT START OFF THAT WAY. ALSO THE OTHER PIECE OF IT IS IS WE HAVE ON MANY SMALL WATER DISTRICTS UP AND DOWN THE STATE WHO REALLY. HAVE PROVED. INADEQUATE TO REALLY DO THE JOB OF MANAGING WATER OR TO DISTRIBUTE THE WATER TO HOUSEHOLDS TO DIFFERENT PLACES. I THINK THAT HARM IN ORDER TO ASSURE THAT WE ACTUALLY FIX THIS PROBLEM WE CAN'T. JUST -- PAY MONEY AND ASSUME THIS'LL BE CLEAN CLEAN UP WE HAVE TO ENSURE AGAIN THAT THE POLLUTERS A PAYING PLAYERS ARE POLLUTING LAST AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT THAT. THERE IS SOME CONSOLIDATION OF MANY OF THESE WATER DISTRICTS WHO AGAIN DID NOT SOUND THE ALARM BELLS TO NOT REALLY RAISE THE ISSUE. INTEL REALLY GOT TOO LATE I THINK THERE HAS TO BE A SORT OF A MUCH -- A MUCH BROADER FIX THAT THE HOPE IS THE ISSUE THAT WE CAN. REACH THAT WHETHER TO THE BUDGET OR WHETHER IT'S THROUGH A SEPARATE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BY THINK THE HOPE REALLY IS -- THAT WE CAN GET TO THAT GET TO THIS ISSUE THIS YEAR. AGAIN IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS JUST APPROPRIATING MONEY BUT IT'S IT'S REALLY TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF THESE WATER DISTRICTS THAT THERE IS -- GREAT RESPONSIBILITY TAKEN BY THOSE WHO BELIEVE WE'RE A SLEEP. SLEEP AT THE WHEEL AND THEN AGAIN MAKING SURE THAT THE POLLUTERS WHO POLLUTED THE WATER -- HAVE TO PAY FOR SOME OF THAT REMEDIATION. FOR THE NIELSEN. THIS IS A BIG ISSUE AND I CERTAINLY WOULD ARGUE FOR THE FOR THE SENATE HAS BEEN ON THIS. THE DEDICATION OF A GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION. FOR WHERE WE'RE AT NOW -- THAT I THINK WE'RE PRETTY MATURED AND CERTAINLY BE TALKING ABOUT A TAX INCREASES AND THOSE ARE NOT WIRED TO WILDLY EMBRACED. AND MANY THINGS HAVE BEEN DONE. THROUGH MANY AUTHORITIES TO GET OUT OUR ISSUES OF WATER SUPPLY WATER QUALITY [inaudible] REPLENISHING AQUIFER'S SERVICE STORAGE. CONVEYANCE SYSTEMS. IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED AREA. THE END YES THERE ARE PROBLEMS. BUT WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT IT. AND IN TERMS OF JUST THE SPECIFIC TAX THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED. THERE'S BROAD AND VERY STRONG OPPOSITION TO THAT I JUST NEED TO GET THAT ON THE RECORD. THANK YOU SIR. FOR TO EVER -- AND I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES THE BEEN SEVEN YEARS NOW AND EVER SINCE I CAME UP HERE THE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN ABOUT WATER. AND I HAVE BEEN -- SHOCKED AND EMBARRASSED. TO BE A CALIFORNIA. AND TO HAVE PEOPLE IN THE STATE WHO DON'T HAVE CLEAN DRINKING WATER. YOU KNOW I CAN GO TO THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES AND SEE THINGS SOMETIMES LIKE THAT BUT MORE THAN LIKELY SEE THINGS BETTER THAN THAT. AND SO THAT TO ME IS VERY ALARMING AND WE'RE STILL DEBATING THE ISSUE. AND TALKING ABOUT TAXING FOLKS WHICH IS. YOU KNOW WHICH ARE WHICH ARE THE GYM WITH THE FOLKS WHO CAN LEAST AFFORD IT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE AREAS ARE IN THE STATE WERE. WE LOOKING AT FOLKS WHO DON'T HAVE CLEAN DRINKING WATER AND ON THAT WATER TO BE THEN. AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND AND AT SOME POINT I YOU KNOW I'M GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE THEY HAS TO COME SOME -- OF RESPONSIBILITY AT THE STATE LEVEL FOR US TO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE THAT ARE RIGHT THE PEOPLE OUT A HALF. IN CALIFORNIA IN THE SAME WAY WE THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO A QUALITY SCHOOL. YOU KNOW A QUALITY KIND OF OF OF LIVING ENVIRONMENT OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CAP AND TRADE A LOT. BUT ALSO BE SOME OF THE FUNDAMENTAL THINGS AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT WATER CLEAN WATER WAS ONE OF THOSE FUNDAMENTAL THINGS. THAT WE BELIEVED IN BECAUSE THE IMPACT OF NOT HAVING CLEAN WATER -- IN THE STATE LIKE THIS COULD HAVE SOME DEVASTATING EFFECTS ON OTHERS WITH REGARDS TO HEALTH. AND ALL THOSE THINGS IF WE JUST CONSTANTLY KICK THIS CAN DOWN THE ROAD IGNORE IT -- WE RESPONSIBILITY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND THAT MEANS DEALING WITH THOSE WHO DONE THE POLLUTION IF THAT MEANS PUTTING THE RESOURCES FOR WORK. THAT WE HOPE TO RECAPTURE IF THERE ARE FOLKS WEAKENED A DIGNIFIED THAT HAVE THIS A AN ISSUE. BUT IT SEEMS LIKE NO CALIFORNIAN SHOULD EVER EVER LIVE WITHOUT CLEAN DRINKING WATER. I MEAN WE SPEND LOTS OF TIME MANY OF US WHO ARE PHILANTHROPIC GOING TO THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES BUILDING WELLS AND ALL THIS KIND OF STUFF TALKING ABOUT THE IMPACT OF CLEAN WATER. ON PEOPLE'S HEALTH AND AND THEY'RE ALL THE THINGS THAT GO ALONG WITH IT AND THEN WE COME HOME AFTER DOING THESE WONDERFUL EXPERIENCES IN ANOTHER COUNTRY. THE BUILDING WELL SOME PEOPLE HAVE CLEAN WATER AND NO HAVE CLEAN WATER HERE -- AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO BITE THE BULLET. AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WE KNOW WHAT THE SOLVE IT IS COMPLICATED BUT A LOT OF PIECES TO IT. BUT IT'S THE SAME TIME WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF CLEAN DRINKING WATER IN CALIFORNIA. AND TO NOT DO THAT IS REALLY REALLY IN MY MIND IT'S EMBARRASSING AS A STATE WITH ALL THE HIGH TECH STUFF WE HAVE IN ALL THE WEALTHY PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE BEAUTIFUL PRISTINE ENVIRONMENT WHICH WE HAVE WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE WATER THEY CAN'T DRINK THAT WAS STILL TAKING WATER INTO COMMUNITIES. OF WHERE THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO TURN ON THE TAP AND SEE CLEAN WATER AND TAKE A BATH. AND SO I YOU KNOW I YOU KNOW I I I SEE THIS AS A BUDGET ISSUE THAT OUGHT TO BE IN THE BUDGET. BECAUSE TO ME THIS IS FUNDAMENTAL FOR CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO GET EVERYBODY HEALTHCARE TRYING TO GET EVERYBODY IN PRESCHOOL TRYING TO GET EVERYBODY AND WE WOULD WOULD THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING. AND YET WE ARE NOT THINKING THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE ABLE TO TURN ON THE TAP. AND GET A CLEAN GLASS WATER. NO WE DON'T WANNA BE FLIPPED BUT WE'RE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION. AND AND AND AND SO TO ME IT'S IT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT AND IT IS A RESPONSIBILITY OF US WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT OF HIS BUDGET FIND THE MONEY. GET IT DONE AND IF WE NEED TO GO AFTER THE PEOPLE WHO DID IT WE GO AFTER BUT NO CALIFORNIAN SHOULD EVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WATER THAT THEY CANNOT DRINK IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITY. THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE. THANK YOU FOR THE SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF ECHO THE COMMENTS OF A MY COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY. AND I AM COMFORTABLE. WELL I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO HOLD THIS OPEN -- AND I KNOW THAT. THE BOTH HOUSES REJECTED THE BROAD TAX ON EVERY INDIVIDUAL WATER USER WHICH HIGH AGREED BECAUSE I FEEL THAT. THE MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WHO FOR NOW DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE AND HEALTHY DRINKING WATER. IT IS DUE [inaudible] TO SOME POLLUTERS. AND IT'S NOT THE SAME POLLUTER BUT IT IS KNOWN POLLUTERS. AND SO TO ASK EVERY OTHER CALIFORNIA. TO COVER THE COST OF THESE KNOWN POLLUTERS IS NOT APPROPRIATE IN MY MIND NOW SOMEONE COULD SAY WELL FOR USE GENERAL FUND IN EFFECT WE'RE DOING NOW WE'RE BASICALLY HAVING THE TAXPAYER. SO I GT THAT. AND I WOULD ULTIMATELY WANT TO SEE US. IN APPLYING THE PRINCIPLE OF POLLUTER PAYS. HOWEVER. THERE IS OF THE PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN FLOATED SO FAR AROUND POLLUTER PAYS. READ LEASES THAT POLLUTER FROM -- A GOOD DEAL OF RESPONSIBILITY AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S A FAIR WAY TO GO SO. I HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE THESE CONVERSATIONS AND WORK THIS OUT SO THAT WERE NOT NECESSARILY ASKING EVERY CALIFORNIANS THROUGH THE GENERAL FUND OR THROUGH A FEE ON THEIR WATER. BUT RATHER WE ARE APPLYING THE POLLUTER PAY PRINCIPLES BUT IN THE MEAN TIME. IF WE HAVE TO FALL BACK THEN I WOULD RATHER USE THE GENERAL FUND. THANK YOU SENATOR OFF. THANK YOU MANAGER OF THE MONEY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- IS NOT GOING TO BE USED FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS CORRECT BECAUSE HIS BOND MONEY FOR THAT IS THAT RIGHT. SIR DO I GO TO PART OF FINANCE THAT'S CORRECT THERE IS CURRENTLY BOND FUNDING AND FEDERAL FUNDING THAT GOES FOR THE CAP INFRASTRUCTURE. AS A PRIMARY FOCUS ON THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE ON OTHER KIND OF EMERGENCY DRINKING WATER NEEDS -- WHERE THE BOND FUNDING AND FEDERAL FUNDING CANNOT REALLY BE USED FOR SO THE THE MONEY THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT WILL BE USED? TO HIRE PEOPLE TO MANAGE PROVIDE MONEY TO HIRE PEOPLE TO MANAGE CLEAN UP IN THE SMALL WATER COMPANIES. THAT COULD BE PART OF IT -- SUBS SUBSIDIZED SUBSIDIZE WATER BILLS -- IF A PART OF THE WATER SYSTEMS TO PAY FOR THEIR ONGOING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE I SEE SO NO [inaudible] IF IF IF WE HANDED YOU A CHECK FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TOMORROW DO WE HAVE A LIST OF WATER COMPANIES. THAT NEED IMMEDIATE ATTENTION AND THE COST FOR EACH OF THOSE COMPANIES -- THE WATER BOARD -- HAVE A LIST OF THOSE WATER SYSTEM THEY ARE CURRENTLY NOT MEETING DRINKING WATER STANDARDS SO THAT WOULD BE KIND OF ONE OF THE KIND OF PRIORITIES LOOKING AT WHO CURRENTLY IS NOT MEETING DRINKING WATER STANDARDS -- BUT THERE ARE OTHER SYSTEMS ARE NOT REGULATED BY THE WATER BOARD SO THERE IS CURRENTLY -- CONFERENCE OF ASSESSING BE CONDUCTED BY THE WATER BOARD WITH FUNDING THEY'LL PROVIDED LAST YEAR THROUGH THE BUDGET -- AND THAT ASSESSMENT WILL HELP CAN GET TO WHERE ARE SOME OF THOSE PRIORITY TO NEED AS PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN -- THAT TO BE A A BI ANNUAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THAT KIND OF HIGHLIGHT THOSE PRIORITY AREAS AND THAT'S ALWAYS BASED OFF OF A BI ANNUAL ASSESSMENT THE WORLD WE KIND OF EVALUATING WHAT THE NEED IS. AT AND HARD BEING THE DOLLARS TOWARDS THAT NEED WHEN WAS THAT ASSESSMENT -- STUDY BE COMPLETED. I THINK IT'S BEING PHASED IN -- THERE'S MULTIPLE PIECES OF THAT STUDY SO -- WE ANTICIPATE WITHIN A YEAR AND A HALF WILL COMPLETE EVERYTHING THERE ISN'T A DEFINED DATA WHEN EACH COMPANY WILL BE COMPLETED BUT THERE MIGHT BE SOME COMPONENT THAT I BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. BUT SENT ITS MULTIPLE COMPONENTS OTHERS MIGHT LIKE UNTIL THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND DO YOU EXPECT WHEN THAT WHEN THAT ASSESSMENT -- STUDY IS COMPLETED THAT THERE WILL BE. A BOTTOM LINE HOW MANY WATER COMPANIES NEED ATTENTION AND HOW MUCH MONEY IS GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO FIX THE PROBLEM. I THINK IT WOULD DEFINITELY GIVE US A LOT OF BETTER SENSE CURRENTLY ARE PROPOSAL WAS BASED OFF OF PREVIOUS AT THAT FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE DID HIGHLIGHT APPROX ME HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT IS THAT'S ALSO HIGHLIGHTED -- HOW MUCH OF THAT IS THAT POTENTIALLY DUE TO POLLUTANTS FROM NITRATES WHICH IS GOING ON WITH THE V. AGRICULTURE CHARGES THAT WE HAVE WITHIN OUR PROPOSAL AND THEN WHAT CHORE -- POLLUTION IS MORE NATURAL CONTAMINATED POLLUTION WHICH IS MORE CONSISTENT WITH THE THE WATER CHARGES ON THE CONSUMERS. YOU KNOW WE HAD A LESSON LAST YEAR THE YEAR FORGET THE YEAR BEFORE ON TRANSPORTATION FUNDING AND AND IN THE IN THAT PARTICULAR LEGISLATIVE EFFORT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. THERE WERE A LIST OF PROJECTS AND DOLLAR TOTALS -- WHERE WE KNEW AND THE ADMINISTRATION -- SPECIFICALLY HOW MUCH MONEY WAS GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO FIX THIS BRIDGE OF THAT ROAD -- EVEN THAT WAS DIFFICULT A DIFFICULT SELL. TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN OUR CONSTITUENTS -- WHEN WE MOVE AWAY FROM -- GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION WHEN WE MOVE TOWARD A FEE OR A TAX OR WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT. THAT'S WHERE WE REALLY RUN INTO TROUBLE BECAUSE AT LEAST DOWN WHERE I COME FROM. I REALLY DON'T WANT TO TAKE MONEY. AND SEND IT TO SACRAMENTO TO LET IT SIT UNTIL WE FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH WE NEED AND WHERE IT'S GOING TO GO. YOU KNOW THEY EXPECT EVEN THE ONES THAT ARE WILLING TO COOPERATE EVEN THE ONES THAT FEEL THE WAY. WE DO UP HERE THAT CLEAN DRINKING WATER IS A RIGHT AND WE NEED TO FIX PROBLEMS WHERE THERE IS A LACK OF CLEAN DRINKING WATER. EVEN PEOPLE WHO SHARE THAT VIEW -- DON'T LIKE THE CONCEPT OF SENDING MONEY TO SACRAMENTO WITHOUT A PLAN. AND THAT'S WHY I GUESS MY QUESTION I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE. TO FIGURE THIS THING OUT EVEN WITH THE GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION I THINK WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH MONEY WE NEED OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME. AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE AND UNTIL WE KNOW THAT I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE HAVE MUCH OF A CONVERSATION. ABOUT FEES OR TAXES. FRANKLY EVEN THE GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION BECAUSE I'M SURE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS. IN THE SENATE SIDE IS NOT GONNA BE ENOUGH TO FIX THIS PROBLEM IS IT. WELL I WOULD SAY THAT THE MESSAGES PROPOSAL IS BASED OFF OF AN ASSESSMENT CONDUCTED TWO YEARS AGO WE DID ESTIMATE APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS -- NEEDED ON GOING ON GOING YES SO THAT MITCHELL PROPOSAL IS. CONSISTENT WITH THAT ANALYSIS HOWEVER WE ARE CONDUCTING ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS TO GET KIND OF MORE GRANULAR DETAIL AND THAT WOULD HELP US IDENTIFY WHAT WOULD BE THOSE KIND OF PRIORITY AREAS. BUT THERE MIGHT BE DIFFERENT APPROACHES IN SOME AREAS WE MIGHT FOCUS ON CONSOLIDATION IN OTHER AREAS WHERE THERE'S NOT A CLOSE ENOUGH WATER SYSTEM THAT WE CAN CONSOLIDATE. THEN WE WOULD BE FOCUSING ON SUPPORTING THEIR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE AS THOUGH IT'S NOT UNTIL YOU GET TO THE GRAND YOUR DETAILS AND WHEN YOU WOULD FOCUS ON WHAT SPECIFIC STRATEGY TO FOCUS ON WHAT SPECIFIC AREA. BUT WE DO HAVE AN INITIAL SENSE BASED OFF OF THE PREVIOUS ESTIMATE OF WHAT IS THOSE THOSE NEEDS AND THAT'S WHY ARE PROPOSALS BASED OFF. WELL YOU I'M YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE'RE TRYING TO HELP BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE CONUNDRUM WE FACE -- WHEN WE'RE NOT ABLE TO TALK TO CONSTITUENTS DIRECTLY AND SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHERE THIS MONEY'S GOING? AND HOW MUCH OF IT IS GOING. TO A PARTICULAR PLACE IT'S A RATHER GENERAL CONCEPT FRANKLY. I READ THE MEDIA AND READ THE NEWSPAPERS EVEN THE NEWSPAPERS ARE CONFUSED -- ABOUT WHETHER IS CAPITAL PROJECTS ARE OPERATING SUBSIDIES. THERE WAS AN ARTICLE I THINK THAT WAS -- AN OP ED BY THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION FOLKS WAS TALKING ABOUT CAPITAL PROJECTS AND BEING PLENTY OF BOND MONEY AND WHY DO YOU NEED TO HAVE THIS SORT OF CONVERSATION WELL. BONWIT THERE IS PLENTY OF BOND MONEY AND PROJECTS AND NOT THE ISSUE HERE SO I THINK THERE'S A COMMUNICATION PIECE THERE'S A ASSESSMENT PIECE. AND THEN OF COURSE WE GET INTO THE FEE TAX OR GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION DISCUSSION I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO HELP WE JUST HAVE A PROBLEM THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT WAS A IMPORTANT ROBUST CONVERSATION I HEAR THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY. ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES -- ON ONE ECHO ON THE SCANNERS POINT ABOUT IN ANY CONTEXT IN WHICH WE HAVE A POLLUTER PAYS KIND OF PRINCIPLE -- IT IT SHOULD NOT AND CANNOT YOU KNOW INCLUDING THE ALLOWANCE FOR THE POTENTIAL CONTINUATION OF POLLUTION OR IN THE PROPELS IMMUNITY I JUST THINK FUNDAMENTALLY THAT'S NOT. A HEALTHY APPROPRIATE DIRECTION TO GO AND I'M SURE EVERYONE'S PERSPECTIVE ABOUT HAVING ACCESS TO WATER BE IN A FUNDAMENTAL PERSONAL RIGHT -- YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S IT'S IRONIC THAT PEOPLE ASSUME WATER STREET. AND EVEN THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER ARE PAYING A PREMIUM FOR IT. A AND SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT'S EVEN MORE OFFENSIVE FOR LOOK FOR TO THIS CONVERSATION I AGREE WITH YOU DOCTOR WET WEBER. IN OUR STATE BUDGET IS A REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES AS OF A LEGISLATIVE BODY AND SO THIS IS THE PLACE. TO SOLVE THIS PROB PROBLEM. ALBEIT TEMPORARY -- BUT IT'S IMPORTANT PLACE FOR US TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. COLLEAGUES IT'S ONE 12-1 T. I THINK I THINK WE CAN GET THROUGH THREE MORE ISSUES. AND SO WE'RE GONNA STOP ISSUE.
