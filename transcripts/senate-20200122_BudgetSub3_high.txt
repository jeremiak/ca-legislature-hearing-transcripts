THE FIRST- AS HEARING OF THE SENATE BUDGET FISCAL REVIEW SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER THREE IN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. FOR TWENTY TWENTY AND WE'RE STARTING OFF- TODAY WITH AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON AN UPDATE ON THE- RATE STUDY IN REFORM IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SYSTEM. AND I THINK IS- OF THE PEOPLE RECALL- LAST YEAR- THE DEPARTMENT OF- PENCIL SERVICES- PRESENTED A RATE STUDY THAT WAS PART OF A- PREVIOUS LEGISLATION- AND- SAID THAT THEY WERE GOING TO WORK ON- I GUESS PLANS TO- TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES IN THE RATE STUDY AND SO- WE SAID WE WOULD WANT TO HAVE A- HEARING HAD TO HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT AND FROM STAKEHOLDERS. REGARDING WHAT ACTIONS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLANNING TO TAKE AS A RESULT OF THE RATE STUDY HOW WOULD MAKE NOTES AND WE CERTAINLY HOPEFULLY YOU'VE HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE BACKGROUND PAPER WE'RE CERTAINLY GOING TO HEAR FROM- OPERATE DIFFERENT FOLKS TODAY- THAT- THE- THIS RATE STUDY I CAME ABOUT AS A RESULT OF LEGISLATION- THAT- AND- MANY WAYS- GIVEN THE CUTS THAT WERE MADE DURING THE GREAT RECESSION WHICH- SOME OF WHICH WERE RESTORED. BUT STILL I THINK PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT. PLAY WE THE STAFF RAY IN THAT'LL SERVICES AND- OF OUR ABILITY TO MEET THE LANTERN AND- DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY SERVICES ACT- THAT- VARIOUS- THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN LEVELS OF COMPLEXITY AND THE INCONSISTENCIES AND- EVEN THE LEVEL FUNDING- WAS IT SUFFICIENT TO MEET THOSE NEEDS SO- WITH THAT- AGAIN BEGIN- WITH- SO YOU PATRICK FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE TO GIVE US. A HISTORY OF THE RATE STUDY- SO IF YOU CAN COME UP HERE I WOULD JUST WANNA MAKE NOTE THAT CERTAINLY WE WILL BE DELVING INTO THIS LATER IN A REGULAR BUDGET PROCESS- THAT- THE GOVERNOR AND HIS- TWENTY TWENTY ONE- BUDGET- AS SHE HAS A PROPOSED A- INCREASE. IN NET INCREASE OF A BILLION DOLLARS- COMPARED TO THE UPDATED CURRENT YEAR BUDGET OF WHICH SIX HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN MILLION WERE- GENERAL FUND INCREASE SO I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE- RESTORATION HAS. INCLUDE INCREASE THE BUDGET- FOR- THE MONTH SERVICES ARE AND- WITH SOME SPECIFIC A RATE INCREASES IN THERE AS WELL AND WHICH A SKIN WILL MENTION THAT WE WILL DELVE MORE INTO WE HAVE A REGULAR BUDGET PROCESS SO- BUT- TODAY WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON- THE RATE STUDY IN THE RESPONSE THE RATE STUDY SO. I WANT TO THANK YOU IN A WELCOME- HISPANIC AND- LOOK FOR TO YOUR REMARKS ABOUT THE HIT. THE FRAME OUR DISCUSSION THE HISTORY OF THE RATE STUDY THANK YOU WELCOME. THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN- AS YOU SAID I'M SO YOU PICK FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND I'M HERE TO PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION IN CONTEXT TO SET THE STAGE FOR THE DISCUSSION TODAY ABOUT THE DDS RATE STUDY. YOU SHOULD HAVE A HAND OUT AND THE SURGEONS ALSO HAVE EXTRA COPIES FOR AUDIENCE MEMBERS- IF YOU COULD TURN TO PAGE ONE I'D LIKE TO START BY NOTING THAT EVEN IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM THE DDS RATE SETTING ARCHITECTURE IS NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD. AMONG THE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SERVICE CATEGORIES THERE ARE NUMEROUS WAYS THAT RATES CAN BE SET. INCLUDING BY THE DEPARTMENT BY STATUTE AND REGULATION THROUGH NEGOTIATION BETWEEN REGIONAL CENTERSAND SERVICE PROVIDERS TO NAME A FEW. HIT IF YOU TURN TO PAGES TWO AND THREE YOU'LL NOTE THAT SOME OF THESE METHODS ARE ONLY THEORETICAL AT THIS POINT GIVEN THE NUMEROUS CHANGES AND ADJUSTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN LAYERED ON TOP OF THE BASIC ARCHITECTURE INCLUDING. RATE FREEZES IMPLEMENTATION OF MEDIAN RATES RATE REDUCTIONS RATE INCREASES RESTORATION OF FUNDING FROM PREVIOUS CUTS. PROGRAM CHANGES ADJUSTMENTS TO COMPLY WITH STATE AND FEDERAL RULES IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FOR THE SPAGHETTI LIKE NATURE OF THE CURRENT RATE SETTING STRUCTURE LET MEMBERS OF THE RATES WORK GROUP WHICH IS A SUBGROUP OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TASK FORCE. AND IS COMPRISED OF FAMILY MEMBERS ADVOCATES SERVICE PROVIDERS REGIONAL CENTER REPRESENTATIVES AND OTHERS- TO CALL FOR A RATES RATES STEADY TO ADDRESS THESE STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES. THERE WAS ALSO AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SUSTAIN A RAPIDLY GROWING SYSTEM. UNDER THE CURRENT STRUCTURE WHICH IS BECOME OVERLY COMPLEX INEQUITABLE ACROSS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND HARD TO UNDERSTAND. AFTER GOVERNOR BROWN CALLED FOR A SPECIAL SESSION IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TO ADDRESS FUNDING IN THE DDS SYSTEM. THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION AGREED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO PROVIDE THE FIRST SIGNIFICANT RATE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF YEARS TO THE SYSTEM. AND TO CALL FOR THE RATE STUDY DDS WAS GIVEN THREE YEARS AND THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO CONDUCT THE STUDY. PER THE LANGUAGE CODIFIED IN STATUTE WHICH IS SUMMARIZED ON PAGE FIVE OF THE HANDOUT THE STUDY WAS TO ADDRESS THE SUSTAINABILITY QUALITY AND TRANSPARENCY OF SERVICES. TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT RESETTING METHODS AND TO EVALUATE THE SERVICE CODE STRUCTURE. THE STUDY EXAMINED RATES SET BY DDS THOSE SAID IN REGULATION AND STATUTE AND THOSE NEGOTIATED BETWEEN REGIONAL CENTERS AND PROVIDERS. THESE RATES ACCOUNT FOR NEARLY SPENDING. THE PRELIMINARY RATE STUDY RESULTS WERE DELIVERED LAST MARCH THE FINAL RESULTS AND RESPONSES TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT WERE DELIVERED ON JANUARY TENTH ALONG WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL- THUS FAR IT WOULD NOTE THAT THE RATE MODELS DEVELOPED IN THE RATE STUDY HAVE NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED AND THE ADMINISTRATION AT THIS POINT DOES NOT- PROPOSED TO IMPLEMENT THOSE RATE MODELS. WITHOUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY BACKGROUND QUESTIONS OR TURN IT OVER TO DIRECTOR PARCHMAN MISTER PULASKI. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- IS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I WANT TO ASK IT WAS AT. GIVEN THE HISTORY AND WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM DOCTOR LARGE MEN ABOUT WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION PLANS. YEAH WE GET TOUCHED ON THE FACT THAT VARIETY OF BOTH FEDERAL STATE LEGISLATIVE ACTION ETCETERA- IF THEY'RE BEEN PREVIOUS EFFORTS TO MEANS THE MOST RECENT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BETTER RATIONALIZE OURS IS OUR FIRST. ATTEMPT IN A VERY LONG TIME NO THERE HAVE BEEN- PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO REFORM THE SYSTEM I BELIEVE THE LAST- SIGNIFICANT EFFORT WAS MADE IN EARLY TWO THOUSANDS- THERE WAS A CALL TO DISCUSS REFORMING THE SYSTEM FOR MANY OF THE SAME REASONS THAT EXISTS TODAY. AND DUE TO- RECESSIONARY CHALLENGES AT THAT TIME THE EFFORT WAS SORT OF. ECHO OKAY ALL RIGHT AND THAT WAS IT THAT WAS JUST ONE I THINK THERE BEEN THINGS EVEN FURTHER IN THE PAST. OKAY AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE- JUST BRIEFLY IS THAT- THE SUN'S RAYS THREE CAME OUT- IN- LAST YEAR IT ALSO INDICATE A VERY SIGNIFICANT- I GUESS. UNDER FUNDING OF THE SYSTEM I MEAN I THINK. TUNE OF WAS ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION THAT'S RIGHT- SO- FROM THE LA AS PERSPECTIVES- I DON'T KNOW TO WHAT DEGREE IS DELVED INTO THAT OR NOT- ANY COMMENTS ON SO WE HAVE THE RATE METHODOLOGY BUT ALSO THE- THE LEVEL MOUNT OF UNDER FINDING THAT- THAT STUDY- DEDICATED YEAH THAT'S RIGHT. OUR OFFICE HAS AN INDEPENDENTLY YOU TRIED TO QUANTIFY THE SORT OF UNDER FUNDING IN THE SYSTEM BUT WE- CERTAINLY ARE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CHALLENGES INCLUDING- PROVIDERS JUST STRUGGLING TO PAY STAFF MINIMUM WAGE INCLUDING LOCAL MINIMUM WAGES RIGHT. OKAY AND THEN- ONE OTHER THING THAT I QUESTION IN TERMS OF THE RATE STUDY ITSELF AND WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM THEM DIRECTLY SO WE CAN IF YOU WANT YOU CAN DISABLE LET THEM EXPLAINED OUT IS THAT BASED ON A SINGLE POINT TIME DATA OR IS IT. SO. ARE IS THAT. OUR ALL LET MISTER PULASKI CAN. THE BUT I THEY THEY- THEY STARTED STUDY BASED ON TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN SPENDING AND THEN WENT FROM THERE AND MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCOUNT FOR- SORT OF INFLATION AND THINGS LIKE THAT SINCE THAT TIME. OKAY SO IT'STRUE BUT YOU COULD YOU SHOULD ASK HIM TO CONFIRM THAT OKAY. ALL RIGHT. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND A YEAR PRE SHEET YOU AYE FRAMING THE- ISSUES FOR A FORCE TODAY THANK YOU DOCTOR AJ THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SO OUR NEXT PANEL- IS ACTUALLY IN OUR VIEW THE RATE STUDY METHODOLOGY WHEN I HAVE- CORRECT APARTMENT FROM DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES AND STEVEN PULASKI FROM BURNS AND ASSOCIATE THEMSELVES. OF BEFORE AS YOU COME UP I SAW SO WHEN EDUCATE FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE INTERESTED IN MAKING PUBLIC COMMENT- WHICH WILL BE AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE HEARING- PLEASE SIGN IN OVER AT THE SERGEANTS DESK- TO FOR IF YOU WISH TO MAKE PUBLIC COMMENTS- TO HAVE A SIGN UP SHEET THERE. OKAY SO YES PEOPLE CAN STILL- JUST FOR THE RECORD- SO WE KNOW WHO'S GOING TO BE SPEAKING A PUBLIC COMMENT- AND- I SHOULD INDICATE I THINK. LOOKING AT THE AUDIENCE I THINK WE'LL BE FINE. I DO HAVE A BIT OF A HARD STOP AROUND NOON SO BECAUSE OF THAT OTHER THINGS SO- BUT I THINK WE SHOULD BE FINE ALL RIGHT- WELCOMED- DRUG DEPARTMENT- THE- WELCOME. VI&lt;c.cyan&gt; THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN- I&lt;/c&gt; CAN NANCY PARCHMENT DIRECTOR THE DEPARTMENT OF WILL SERVE AS AND- HAPPY TO BE HERE AND I ALSO HAVE WITH ME EVEN PLOWS SKI WHO IS OUR CONSULTANT WITH BURNS AND ASSOCIATE- I'M JUST GOING TO VERY BRIEFLY JUST MAKE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS BEFORE- HAVING MISTER PULASKI WALK THROUGH. AND THE DETAILS THAT HAVE BEEN ASKED FOR IN THE AGENDA- I DO WANT TO THANK- A STAFF FOR THE WORKING TO THE DETAIL IN THE AGENDA DOES CERTAINLY SAVE. YOU KNOW SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND TIME- THAT WE NEED TO DO TODAY AND GIVING FRAMEWORK. FOR DISCUSSION SO THANK YOU I. WE WERE DURING THE WORK OF THE THINGS THAT WAS CREDIT AND I WANT TO THANK OUR TO. FOR THEIR- INSURANCE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS OF THE TIME THAT THEY WORKED WITH US IN NOT ONLY WITHIN THE- STRUCTURE OF THE- SERVICE PROVIDER- SURVEYS AND- THE THINGS THAT WE NEEDED TO DO WITH THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT TO BE ABLE TO. BE INFORMED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE RIGHT STUDY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE RIGHT MODELS. THEY ARE VERY OPEN THEY WERE PART OF THE PROCESS. I MEAN WE COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT THAT ENGAGEMENT ADDITIONALLY WITH THE FAMILIES AND CONSUMERS AND PROVIDING US CONTEXT TO. WHAT WERE THE THINGS THAT WERE REALLY IMPORTANT TO THEM WITHIN THE STRUCTURE. OF A BUILDING THE RATE MODELS AND THE WORK WITHIN THE RATE STUDY. SO JUST VERY QUICKLY I WANT TO JUST IDENTIFIES SOME OF THE GUIDING- ELEMENTS THAT WERE PART OF THE RATE STUDY- WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT IT IT WAS VERY MUCH CONSISTENT WITH- THE ITEMS THAT WERE OUTLINED IN A B. X. TWO ONE IN THE FRAMEWORK IN IN MOVING FORWARD. AND TAKING A LOOK AT THE EFFICIENCY OF PAYMENT STRUCTURES- AS MISS MEDICAID NOTED THAT WE HAVE A VERY COMPLEX SYSTEM IN OUR RATES- SPAZ SERVICE CODES EXETER HAD BEEN COMPLEXITY BEEN BUILT UPON. OVER THE YEARS AND SO IT REALLY DID TAKE A LOOK AT. TAKING A LOOK AT BILLING CODES IN THE UNITS THE SERVICE. ALSO TAKING A LOOK AT BUILDING ON PROVIDERS- SO. CANICE BILLETED TO MOVE FORWARD AND STABILIZATION WITHIN THE PROVIDER DID PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA. OF TAKING A LOOK AT THE EQUITY WITHIN THE DIFFERENT- GEOGRAPHIC AREA AND- SERVICE- GROUPS. AND SUPPORTING QUALITY OF SERVICES THE UNDERLINING COMPONENT OF WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT HOW WE'RE DELIVERING SERVICES TO THE EXPECTATION OF OUR COMMUNITY. AND SO LOOKING AT QUALITY SERVICES AND THAT FRAMEWORK TAKING- THE- FOCUS ON SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY INSPECTING. REGIONAL DIFFERENCES TO TRAIN YOUR BIRD IS PUMP. NEEDS OF THE AND DOES WERE SERVINGS. CONTENT TO CHANGE OF ALL OVER. COMPLY WITH A- YES. ROLE AT ALSO TAKE. OKAY BE. THANK YOU IN. STATE AND BE. TO THE WIDE MINIMUM WAGE. AND THEN FOR. SEEN CERTAIN. SUCH AS EMPLOYEE. SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO I'M GOING AND HANDED OVER TO. PLUS. GRAY CONVERTING. MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU AND THE COMMITTEE HERE THIS MORNING- ABSTRACT APARTMENT SAID MY NAME STEVEN KLASKY IN THE VICE PRESIDENT OF BROWN'S ASSOCIATES AND THE PROJECT MANAGER FOR THIS PARTICULAR ENGAGEMENT. I'D LIKE TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT THE MAJOR PHASES OF THE RATES OF THE RATE STUDY GIVEN ALL AGING AS DRUG DEPARTMENT THE FARMERS THAT STAFF TO INPUT INTO THE MEMORANDUM SO SIMPLY TRY TO RE CAST HELD AS WE THINK ABOUT THESE RATES ENGAGEMENTS AN ADULT CERTAINLY LEAVE TIME FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. ONE EIGHT SEVEN PRO LIKE THIS THERE'S FOUR MAJOR PHASES OF THE WORK THAT WE DEAL IN THE FIRST PHASE IT'S MAKING SURE THAT WE DEVELOP AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE SYSTEM FOR WHICH WERE DEVELOPING THE RATES AS THE OLD SAW GOES AND IT SYSTEMS WHEN YOU SEE ONE ID SYSTEM YOU SEE IN ONE IT SYSTEM SO EVERY SINGLE STATE IS QUITE UNIQUE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCES THAT MAKE THE STATE UNIX THAT WERE ROOF BUILDING REYES REFLECTIVE OF THAT. INDIVIDUAL STATES REQUIREMENTS. AND SO AS PART OF THAT BACKGROUND RESEARCH WE COR START WITH THE REQUIREMENTS MAYBE X. TO WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DESIGNED A RACE SO THAT WAS COMPLIANCE. WITH THOSE DICTATES. WE ALSO WILL READ A NUMBER OF THE USE OF REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED A PRIOR TO A. B. X. TWO ONE PASSING SO AS YOU ASKED STAFF DURING THE OPENING REMARKS- THE ISSUE OF RACE HAS BEEN A LONG STANDING CONCERN FOR MANY WITHIN THE IT COMMUNITY SO QUITE A BIT. OF MATERIAL HAS BEEN PUBLISHED OVER TIME IN THAT PARTICULAR REGARD. WE ALSO TOOK A LOOK AT KERN UTILIZATION PATTERNS THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE MAJORING IN THE MAJORS AS WE SAY THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON THOSE SERVICES THAT. GENERATE THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF SPENDING AS MISS PATRICK SAID EARNED HER REMARKS THE SERVICE CODE INCLUDED IN OUR SCOPE WORK ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 90% OF PURCHASE A SERVICE SPENDING SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE WERE COVERING. THOSE MAJOR AREAS. AND FINALLY WE DID QUITE A BIT OF WORK TO WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY TO FIND IS BOTH DIAZ AS WELL AS PROVIDE ASSOCIATIONS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDER GROUPS OF BEFORE WE- REALLY STARTED THE DATA COLLECTION EFFORT. WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WORKING WITH EDS MAKES THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE REGULATIONS WHEN THEY WERE AVAILABLE. WE MADE PRESENTATIONS TO PROVIDER GROUPS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS SOCIAL ASIANS REALLY ANYONE WHO ASKED FOR OUR TIME WE WANT TO MAKE A PRESENTATION TO THEM BOTH FOR US TO SHARE OUR PROCESS. BUT ALSO TO GET FEEDBACK FROM ABOUT WHAT IS IMPORTANT AND WHAT THEY THINK WE OUGHT TO KEEP IN MIND AS WE ARE CONDUCTING THE RATE STUDY. AND THE SECOND PHASE. PROJECT WE MOVED ON THE DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS. AND THAT REALLY INVOLVED INFORMATION BOTH FROM THE PROVIDER SO WITHIN THE SYSTEM AS WELL AS INDEPENDENT DATA SOURCES THAT IS DOWN FROM OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THOSE IN SYSTEM DATA SOURCES ONE OF OUR PRIMARY INFORMANTS WAS A PROVIDER SIR BACK. IS A RATHER COMPREHENSIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNS TO GATHER INFORMATION RELATED TO PROVIDERS COSTS. AS WELL AS A MATTER WHICH THEY'RE DELIVERING SERVICES TO MIX THAT WERE UNDERSTANDING THINGS LIKE STAFFING RATIOS ARE STAFFING LEVELS THE PRODUCTIVITY OF STAFF THAT IS TO SAY HOW MUCH TIME THEY'RE SPENDING ON BILLABLE ACTIVITIES WERE SADDAM BILLABLE ACTIVITIES. ULTIMATELY WE WERE PRETTY PLEASE WITH THE PARTICIPATION WE HAD NOT PROVIDER SURVEY WE HAD ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED VENDORS SUBMIT A COMPLETED SURVEY TO US. IN ADDITION TO THE VENDOR SURVEY WE CONDUCTED AN INDIVIDUAL FAMILY SURVEY ACTUALLY THROUGH ONE OF OUR SUBCONTRACTORS ON THIS PARTICULAR ENGAGEMENTS THE HUMAN SERVICES RESEARCH INSTITUTE. AND THAT WAS DESIGNED TO INSURE THAT WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILY MEMBERS IN THE SYSTEM SO WASN'T DESIGNED TO CAPTURE COSTA DATA SO TO SPEAK THAT WAS GATHERED TO THE PROVIDER SURVIVE. BUT TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT THE VALUE OF THE SYSTEM WHAT THEY THINK IT'S STRONG POINTS ARE AND POTENTIAL AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT. RECOGNIZING THAT PROVIDERS COSTS ARE DRIVEN MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE BY THE RACE THEY'RE BEING PAID TODAY WE ALSO ENDEAVOR TO IDENTIFY WHAT WE CALL INDEPENDENT SOURCES OF DATA. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I KNOW WE SPOKE ABOUT AT SOME LENGTH DURING THE LAST TIME I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE. WAS INFORMATION FROM THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS WHICH PUBLISHES. CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC WAGE DATA FOR A VARIETY OF OCCUPATIONS. WE LIKE TO USE THAT AS A INFORMANTS TO OUR PROCESS BECAUSE IT'S CROSS INDUSTRY. IT'S NOT RELY TO JUST ON WHAT DVD PROVIDERS ME DIAZ FOR BITERS ARE DELIVERING IT REALLY LOOKS AT. I INDUSTRIES THAT ARE COMPLYING COMPARABLE STAFF. BUT IN OTHER SOURCES OF INFORMATION INCLUDE VARIOUS FEDERAL PUBLICATIONS ABOUT THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE IN THE TO THE INDIVIDUAL STATES- WE USE THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE'S STANDARD MILEAGE RATE TO COST OUT TRANSPORTATION RELATED EXPENSES WE USED INFORMATION FROM THE- WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE RATING BUREAU TO. SET THE WORKERS COMP RATES AND THE WRESTLING INTO A VARIETY OF OTHER DATA SOURCES SIMILAR TO THAT AS WELL THE IDEA WAS. TO MAKES THAT WE'RE NOT CREATING A CIRCULAR ARGUMENTSWERE PROVIDERS COSTS REFLECTIVE OF THE RACE ARE BEING PAID TODAY SO. IF WE WERE JUST CITY SIMPLY BASED. ON INFORMATION WE WOULD. EFFECTIVELY END UP IN THE SAME PLACE WITH THAT WHAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WERE SOME. ISSUES WITH AT LEAST FOR THE SOURCE CODE. THAT WE THINK ABOUT THE ADDRESSED. ALSO AS PART OF THAT GOT A CALL. PHASE WE DID OF LOT OF WORK TO. READ DIFFERENCE IN CALL SAYS EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM CAN. CAL IS A DIVERSE STATE. AND SO TO MAKE SENSE FOR US TO SEND A SINGLE RATE THAT WOULD APPLY TO EVERY SINGLE. REGION OR AREA OF THE STATE. INTO THE AREAS WE- FOCUSED ON A PARTICULAR WERE WAGE DIFFERENCES. DIFFERENCES IN TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS OF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN PROVIDERS AND THE PEOPLE TO WHOM THEY'RE DELIVERING SERVICES. AND REAL ESTATE EXPENSES. WE ACTUALLY PUBLISHED A SEPARATE COMPANION PIECE IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT DETAILED EXACTLY HOW DOES ONE ABOUT THAT SINCE IT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF. THE RATE STUDY. HAVING DONE THAT DATA COLLECTION ANALYSIS WE MOVED ON TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF RATE MODELS. BAND ONE OF THE KEY. COMPONENTS ARE ONE OF OUR KEY PRINCIPLES IN THIS WORK WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE TRANSPARENCY TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. SO THAT RESULT IN ANY RATE PACKET THAT RECESSED EXCEEDS NOW ABOUT THREE THOUSAND PAGES BUT WE ARE NOTHING IF NOT THOROUGH. SO WE'D OUTLINED OUR SPECIFIC ASSUMPTIONS OUR DATA SOURCES AND OUR METHODOLOGY SO THAT FOLKS CAN RECREATE EFFECTIVELY OUT AS WE ESTABLISH THE RATES. AND WE DID THAT BECAUSE IT REALLY HELPS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC COMMENT PROCESS WAS VALUE ADDED IF ALL WE WERE TO SAY THAT WE THINK RATE OUGHT TO BE. THIRTY DOLLARS. ON THE WE WILL GET PROVIDER SAY THAT WE THINK ARE THE THIRTY FIVE BUT WITHOUT ANY BASIS FOR- IDENTIFIED THE DIFFERENCES AND WHERE WE'VE WAITED WE REALLY CAN'T HAVE. AND FORM CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE THIRTY OR THIRTY FIVE IS MORE APPROPRIATE. AT SO OUR PROCESS WE BUILT THREE MODELS WAS TO BUILD A BASE RATE MODEL. TO SAY THESE ARE WHAT WE THINK TO BE. REASONABLE COSTS ARE DELIVERING SERVICES CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S REQUIREMENTS AN INDIVIDUAL SERVICE PLANS. AND THEN FROM THERE WE APPLIED WE CALLED REGIONAL ADJUSTMENT FACTORS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE COUNTING FOR THOSE OUT FOR MENTION DIFFERENCES IN WAGES TRAVEL AND REAL ESTATE EXPENSES. WE DELIVER THOSE RATE MODELS IN FEBRUARY OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT WAS FOLLOWED SHORTLY THEREAFTER BY THE PUBLICATION THE FULL RATE STUDY MARCH FIFTEENTH OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AND THOSE TWO DELIVERIES KICKED OFF A PUBLIC COMMENT PROCESS WHICH I KNOW WILL TALK ABOUT IN MORE DETAIL LATER ON THIS AGENDA SALAS PROVIDE A QUICK HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF. BUT AFTER PUBLISHING JEFFREY MODELS AND ALL OF OUR SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION WE ENCOURAGED PROVIDERS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO PROVIDE WRITTEN FEEDBACK TO US ABOUT WHAT IT IS THEY THOUGHT. WAS WELL DONE WHO ARE AREAS WHERE THEY THOUGHT WE SHOULD POTENTIALLY LOOK TAKE A SECOND LOOK ABOUT THE GIVEN ASSUMPTIONS. AND AGAIN WILL GO INTO THE RESPONSE TO THOSE COMMENTS AND WHAT SOME OF THE CHANGES WE MADE WERE. IN A FEW MOMENTS BUT SUFFICE IT TO SAY- THE COMMENTS TO RESULT IN LITERALLY DOZENS OF CHANGES TO OUR RATE MODELS PUBLISHED BACK IN MARCH. AND RESULTED IN THE AVERAGE RATE INCREASING BY ABOUT SEVEN AND A HALF PERCENT- CERTAINLY SOME RATES INCREASED BY A GREATER EXPANSE IN RESPONSE THE PUBLIC COMMENTS AND SOME. INCREASED BY LESSER EXTENT OR IN A HANDFUL CASES ARE ACTUALLY SLIGHT REDUCTIONS THE RACE BUT OVERALL. WE'RE LOOKING ABOUT SEVEN AND A HALF PERCENT INCREASE. IN THE AVERAGE RATE. AND WITH THAT AS THE DIRECTOR STAFF MENTIONED- WE NOW DELIVERED FINAL RATE MODELS IN RESPONSE THOSE PUBLIC COMMENTS IN THOSE WERE PUBLISHED EARLIER THIS MONTH. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT THE RATE SETTING PROCESS. OKAY THANK YOU AND- WE WILL BE COMING BACK TO THE RESPONSE TO BOTH THE COVER PUBLIC COMES IN NEXT STEPS IN AND ANOTHER PANEL I KNOW YOUR BACK YOUR FOR THAT. THE DOCTOR- SO BUT I DO HAVE SOME TERMS OF YOUR METHODOLOGY SO FIRST OF ALL- AT THOSE QUESTION LA BUT- HE SAID SO HOW THE DATA THAT'S IN THE- MOST RECENT. VERSION THAT WAS. PRESENTED IN JANUARY. IS THAT IS THE STEP HAS THERE BEEN UPDATED- GIVEN. FROM THE ORIGINAL DATA IN TERMS OF- I UNDERSTAND WAS TWENTY SIXTEEN DATA THAT YOU WORKED WITH IN THE BEGINNING SO IT'S ONE KNOW WHAT. DATA IS BEING USED IN THE MOST RECENT REPORT. AND NANCY BARGE MEN- AGAIN MISTER POLICY CAN GIVE SOME ADDITIONAL DETAIL BUT AS AS NOTED THAT THE- PUBLIC COMMENT AND THEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE SOME OF THE UPDATED INFORMATION THAT THAT IS PROVIDED AS THE SOURCE OF THE UPDATED- GREAT MODELS AND THE FOR THE FINAL REPORT THAT WAS POSTED AND SO. IT WAS BASED ON THAT REGIONALLY ON SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND IT WAS RE BASED WITH UPDATED INFORMATION FROM EIGHTEEN NINETEEN I BELIEVE IS THAT ACCURATE THAT'S CORRECT AND IT ABOUT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN TWO POTENTIAL- BLINDS OF QUESTIONING. THE RATE MODELS THEMSELVES REFLECT WHAT WE THINK A REASONABLE COT ASSUMPTIONS AS OF JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY. SO WHEN WE PUBLISHED THREE MODELS IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN OF COURSE THE IDEA WAS THE SOONEST THE MOST OPTIMISTIC THE MOST OPTIMISTICALLY THAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED WAS IN. THE FISCAL YEAR AND NOW FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY AND WE CHOSE THE MID POINT OF THAT FISCAL YEAR. AND SO AS PART OF OUR UPDATING THE RATE MODELS WE DID LOOK TO SEE IF NEW DATA HAD BEEN PUBLISHED IN OF COURSE IN THE SPAN OF ALMOST TWO YEARS THAT WAS THE CASE SO WE USE NEW BLS DATA. WE USE NEW INFORMATION FROM THE W. C. I. R. B. WE USE THE IRS'S FINAL PUBLICATION FOR THEIR STANDARD MILEAGE RATE IN TWENTY TWENTY. THAT BEING SAID THE RIGHT MODEL STILL REFLECT WE THINK OF THE COSTS AS OF JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY INCLUDING BY STATE WHY MINIMUM WAGE OF THIRTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. SO IF THE RIGHT MODELS WERE TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE FUTURE YEAR. LIKELY WE WOULD NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE ASSUMPTIONS INFLATE THEM FORWARD TO JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY TWENTY TWO OR AT WHATEVER STAGE. OF THE STATE WOULD CHOOSE TO IMPLEMENT THE RATE MODELS SO THAT'S WHAT THE RATE MODELS REFLECT ON THEM AS THE DIRECTOR MENTION AN AS MISS PADDOCK MENTIONED IN TERMS OF THE FISCAL IMPACT ANALYSIS THAT WAS BASED UPON ANALYSIS OF FISCAL YEAR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN CLAIMS THE CLAIM TO DRIVE THE RATE MODELS BUT IT TO DRIVE THE FISCAL IMPACT ANALYSIS. AND WE TALK A LITTLE BIT WE'LL TALK A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THAT I THINK LATER IN THE PRESENTATION ABOUT SOME OF THE UPDATES TO HOW WE FORECAST THE FISCAL IMPACT OF THAT ON YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE AGENDA. BUT IT IS NOW UPDATED TO REFLECT CLAIMS DATA BECAME AVAILABLE TO US AFTER THE PUBLICATION MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AND AN YEAH I KNOW YOU CAN TELL A LOT MORE PUBLIC BUT I THINK THE SS DEUCE SIR IF THE STUDY ITSELF THE OF THE CHARGES FOR THE STUDY WAS AROUND THE ISSUE OF. BE SURE YOU HAVE AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF PROVIDERS IN YOUR METHODOLOGY DEVELOPING THE STUDY HOW DID YOU TRIED TO DO YOU DRESS THAT OR DID YOU TO ADD TO. THE OP THAT ISSUE IN TERMS OF YOUR DESIRE. BOB YOUR DESIGN AND OUT NOW THE RESULTS IS A ARE YOU DID. STEPPING ADDRESS YOUR YOUR MIND AS THE PERSON WHO DID IT. SO IN MY MIND WE CERTAINLY DID TRY TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT THE- RATE STUDY DOES NOT. RECOMMEND OR SUGGEST A SPECIFIC QUANTITY OF PROVIDERS WERE A RATIO OF THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS TO INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING SERVICES THERE ARE NO NATIONAL STANDARDS IN THOSE REGARDS. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE FEDERAL RULES AROUND ACCESS TO SERVICES IT TALKS ABOUT THAT FOLKS ON MEDICAID OUGHT TO HAVE ACCESS TO SERVICES COMPARABLE TO THOSE ON PRIVATE INSURANCE. BUT THAT'S REALLY CHALLENGE AND THE X. CBS ENVIRONMENT RIGHT THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE WE'RE TALKING HOSPITAL RATES ARE POSITION RATES BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE FOR HOSPITALIZATIONS OR POSITIONS. THERE REALLY IS EFFECTIVELY NO PRIVATE MARKET FOR HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES WE DON'T HAVE A STANDARD BY WHICH WE CAN MEASURE ACCESS TO CARE QUITE AS EASILY. AS WE DO WHEN WE DO ACCESS TO CARE STUDIES IN OTHER STATES FOR- YOUR TRADITIONAL MEDICAID SERVICES. THAT BEING SAID WE ENDEAVOR TO BUILD RATE MODELS THAT WE AS I MENTIONED DURING MY REMARKS WERE REFLECT ABOUT THE COST OF DELIVERING SERVICES. SO WE TO TAKE IN ACCOUNT THINGS LIKE REGIONAL DIFFERENCES AND ONE'S RECOGNIZE THAT THE COST OF LIVING SERVICES IN THE BAY AREA IS DIFFERENT THAN THE COST OF DELIVERING SERVICES. INLAND FOR EXAMPLE WE THINK THROUGH HAVING RATES THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF THOSE COSTS THAT OUGHT TO BE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY PROVIDERS I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. IS WORTHWHILE CONTINUE TO MONITOR OVER TIME AND CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE THE EXECUTIVE HAVE BEEN CRITICALLY INTERESTED IN DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO SERVICES. BASED UPON DIFFERENT LINGUAL- RACIAL ETHNIC GROUPS AND CERTAINLY I THINK. IT'S WORTHWHILE TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR THAT ACCESS AS WELL AS ACCESS ON A GEOGRAPHIC PERSPECTIVE. YEAH ME MADE REFERENCE TO. SAY NO SIR THINGS ARE. IF THERE. HAD HEALTH CARE RELATED TO MEDI CAL RATES AND WE HAVE WON THE LOWEST MEDICAL RATESIN THE WHOLE COUNTRY AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF. IN FACT MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY DELIVER MEDICAL SERVICES. GET ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIES. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO WHERE DOES MEDI CAL RATES USE FOR THOSE PARTICULAR SERVICES. ARE WHERE THEY ADJUSTED FOR ACTUAL. PAYMENT AND THAT FULL PAYMENT NOT JUST THE MEDI CAL RATE. SO WHEN WE PUBLISHED THE REYES CITY BACK IN MARCH FOR A NUMBER OF WHAT WE TERM TO PROFESSIONAL SERVICES THOSE ARE SERVICES DELIVERED BY- FOLKS THAT ORDINARILY LICENSED OR CREDENTIAL THINGS LIKE THERAPIES- OF A LOT OF THE- SPECIALIZED THERAPEUTIC SERVICES AS WELL AS ADAPTIVE SKILLS TRAINING AND THE NUMBER OF SERVICE. FALL UNDER THE UMBRELLA UP INTO DEVELOPMENTS AS YOU KNOW WE DID PROPOSED TO TIE THOSE RATES TO THE RATES PAID ON UNDER THE MEDICARE FEE SCHEDULE AT LEAST FOR FEE OR SERVICE- WITH THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO OFFER ABOUT A 40% ENHANCEMENT WHICH WAS CONSISTENT WITH ANOTHER PROGRAM AT THE MUCH SMALLER PROGRAM. HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IN RESPONSE TO PUBLIC COMMENTS THAT METHODOLOGY WAS WITHDRAWN AND RATHER THAN TIME RATES TO THE MEDI CAL FEE FOR SERVICE SCHEDULE WE DID ACTUALLY DEVELOP RATE MODELS FOR- THOSE THAT HAD BEEN ORIGINALLY PROPOSED TO BE TIED SO THERE ARE NOW RATE MODELS FOR SPECIALIZED THERAPEUTIC SERVICES TO LIVE UNDER SERVICE CODES ONE FIFTEEN ONE SIXTEEN ONE SEVENTEEN. ADAPTIVE SKILLS TRAINING AND INFILL DEVELOPMENT SERVICES THEIR INDEPENDENCE OF THE MEDI CAL RATES. OKAY BECAUSE I MEAN I THINK. TALK ABOUT CIRCULAR. RIGHT NOW ARMS ARE MEDICAL RATES ARE NOT BASED ON MARKET IS THERE IN FACT- THERE'S ACTION EXPECTATION THAT PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE MEDICAL SERVICES ARE SUBSIDIZED- FROM REIMBURSES THEY'RE GETTING FROM COMMERCIAL OR THEY ARE CLINICS THAT CAN GET YOU KNOW AGAIN- PROTECTED PAYMENT THERE ARE OTHER TYPES OF ADJUSTMENTS- THAT THAT ACTUALLY NHANCE THEIR REIMBURSEMENT SO SOON IS THE CHAIR SUBCOMMITTEE OVERSEES MEDI CAL QUITE AWARE. AND ALSO AS A MEDICAL PROVIDER IS A PEDIATRICIAN- SO LET THE SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE MAKE NO TO THOSE THINGS- WHEN IT COMES TO IN TERMS OF YOU SAID YOU DEVELOP THESE RATE MODELS. HOW SO WITH IT LIKE A ONE IS ISSUES THAT- ALSO LOOKING AT WAS THE STATS- TRYING TO RATIONALIZE THE PAYMENT SYSTEM AS WE HEARD FROM OHIO IT'S A IT'S A- SO WHAT KIND OF WORK DID YOU DO SO YOU TALKED ABOUT THE VARIOUS METHODOLOGIES TRY TO COME UP WITH THE AMOUNTS AND SO FORTH BUT IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY TRYING TO BETTER RATIONALIZE THE PAYMENT SYSTEM IN THESE- WORKING CAN YOU DESCRIBE ABOUT THE- HOW HE CAME ABOUT- DOES SUCH RECOMMENDATIONS. SHORT SO I THINK THE REALLY TWO PRIMARY THINGS THAT WE SOUGHT TO DO IN RESPONSE THAT PARTICULAR REQUIREMENT A. B. X. TWO ONE. FUNDAMENTALLY WE DID WANT TO ESTABLISH RATES THAT ENSURE THAT PROVIDERS DELIVERING THE SAME SERVICE WITHIN THE SAME REGION RECEIVE THE SAME RATE. AND SO HAVING SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME LOOKING AT ACTUAL CLAIMS DATA THERE ARE. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WITHIN A REGIONAL CENTER AND THEN BETWEEN REGIONAL CENTERS EVEN THOSE THAT ARE A JOINING AND THE RATES PAID TO PROVIDERS. SO THERE MIGHT BE A PROVIDER THAT'S DELIVERING A SERVICE AND BEING PAID FORTY DOLLARS AN HOUR AND A PROVIDER IS LITERALLY DELIVERING THE SAME SERVICE WITHIN THE SAME REASONS BEING PAID TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER HOUR. SO THE MOVEMENT TO STANDARDIZE BE SCHEDULE WOULD ENSURE THAT A MORE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR VENDORS ACROSS THE STATE NOW AGAIN WE ON THE STATE WIDE RATE BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED IN AS EVERYONE ACKNOWLEDGES THE TOSS IN THE BAY AREA ARE DIFFERENT ON THE COST. MORE INLAND SO THAT WAS THAT THE FIRST THING WE WANTED TO DO WAS TO- INSURE MORE PARITY AND THERE'S COURT REASONS WHY THESE THINGS HAVE TRANSPIRED OVER TIME IN TERMS OF THE RATE FREEZE IS WHEN PEOPLE BEGAN DELIVERING SERVICES SO. THAT'S NOT MEANT AS A NET CRITICISM NECESSARILY BUT JUST NOT SURVEYS AND THERE WAS A LOT OF INEQUITY. IN THE SYSTEM AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE STANDARDIZED RATES IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS THAT SOME OF TO. CREATE A MORE RATIONAL SYSTEM. BUT THAT THE RATES OF THE- INCLUDE AND STILL CONTINUES TO INCLUDE ALTHOUGH PER. NOT TO. THE SAME DEGREE WHAT. MORE APPROPRIATE. SOME SERVE CODES CALIFORNIA HAS FROM AND IT SYSTEM PERSPECTIVE ONE THE MORE COMPLEX- SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEMS- IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SERVICES THAT ARE IDENTIFIED AND SOUGHT THAT. OTHER STATES ARE PROVIDING SIMILAR SUPPORTS BUT THEY'RE DOING IT UNDER A PATIENT'S LESTER NUMBER OF SORT WHAT YOU WOULD CALL SERVICE CODE SO. WHERE APPROPRIATE WE DID LOOK TO COLLAPSE SERVICE CLOSER- SEEKING TO ACCOMPLISH A SIMILAR TASK INTO A SINGLE SERVICE CODE SO WE DON'T HAVE. PAID A SITUATION WHERE. AGAIN WE HAVE TO PROVIDERS DOING EFFECTIVELY THE SAME THING I WANT PROVIDERS DOING IT UNDER SERVICE CUTBACKS IN ANOTHER PROVIDERS DOING UNDER SERVICE CALLED WHY IT MADE SENSE THAT A FOUR DOOR. BUT IT. THIS CODE. ACTIVITY IN JEW SO IT'S CONCEPT OF BASED BUDGETING AND WAS THAT CAN OUR COURT IN DEVELOPING THE RIGHT MODELS. BUT FOR THE YEAH SO REGARDING EXPLORING ALTERNATIVE MODELS OF PAYMENT- THOSE ARE CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS TO THIS IS THE THAT WAS A ROCK SIDES EYES ENCLAVE IN TERMS OF FLEX INTO ALL IN THE CURRENT RATE STUDY YEAH  WAS ALSO TAKING A LOOK AT YOU KNOW WITHIN- AND AS MISTER PULASKI HAD IDENTIFIED THE FEE FOR SERVICE- SO IT WASN'T ATTACHED TO THEN. OKAY TO SERVICE OUTCOMES SPECIFICALLY AND SO THOSE ARE THAT CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS TO HAVE OKAY SO IT WILL WILL GET BACK TO THEM THEY'LL PADS WONDERING TO WHAT DEGREE WAS THAT DO DEAL WITH IT'S YOU WERE DEVELOPING THIS THIS STUDY THAT'S PRESENT A WEEK YEAH YEAH THANK YOU WE WHAT WE DID DO IS THAT WE DID TAKE A LOOK AT OTHER HELP OTHER STATES ARE HOW OTHER. SYSTEMS HAVE AN APPROACH IN DELAY OF PAYMENT MODELS OKAY AND SO CONSIDERING ALL OF THE FACTORS IN CONSIDERING KIND OF THE PRIORITIES WITHIN THE RATE STUDY THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WERE WERE VIEWED AND BY YOU WAITED. ON ANYTHING IT JUST. A SOUND TO DIRECTOR MARGINS FROM. AS SHE NO WE DON'T HAVE. A SET OF AT THE FOR BUT OUTCOMES THE NOT TIE PAYMENTS THOSE OUT. BUT WE DIDN'T ENDEAVOR TO BUILD RATES THE REFLECTIVE OF SYSTEM VALUES SELF FOR EXAMPLE TO DOES TO GIVE YOU A COUPLE. FOR TWENTY TODAY STATE PROGRAMS WE SET A SEPARATE FEES FOR SERVICES DELIVERED IN A CENTER AND HIGHER RATES FOR SERVICES DELIVERED IN THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE- AS A SYSTEM. I THINK THERE IS WIDESPREAD AGREEMENT THAT THE MORE INTEGRATED THE SERVICE THE BETTER IT IS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL. AND SO WE HAVE HIGH RATES FOR THOSE COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES IT'S NOT MEASURING- SPECIFIC. COME OTHER THAN ARE WE SPENDING MORE TIME IN THE COMMUNITY. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAD IN THE RATE BUDDY IS PROPOSE. DIFFERENT WORDS THE ROBBERY SAY WILL BE IMPLEMENTED WHAT. IS THE ADOPTION OF A TEAR D. S. P.% SYSTEM WITH THE IDEA BEING THAT. FOR THOSE DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE RECEIVING MORE TRAINING AND HAVE HIGHER SKILLS GO THROUGH SOME SORT OF CREDENTIALING PROCESS. THE BEHIND A REIMBURSEMENT. IT. A IT'S NOT MEDI BRING CIVIC UP PERCENT. WE'RE TAKING A AN OFF COLOR FACE. THAT IF WE MORE QUALIFIED STAFF DELIVERING SERVICES LIKELY THERE TO LIVE HIGHER. SERVE IN THEIR FOR CHEAP. BETTER OUTCOME. FOR INDIVIDUAL SO THE BEST DRUG DEPARTMENTS OTHERS ONGOING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW IT IS WE CAN CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT MORE VALUE BASED OPPORTUNITIES AND DDS IS ACTUALLY DONE SOME OF THIS WORK EVEN BEFORE THE RACE ARE THEY HAVE. VALUE BASED PAYMENTS FOR EMPLOYMENT SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE THEY MAKE BUT I WOULD REFER TO AS KICK PAYMENTS. ONE VENDORS ARE SUCCESSFULLY ABLE TO MOVE SOMEONE INTO A PLAN IS A KIND OF GET A IN CENTER BONUS PAYMENTS BECAUSE THAT'S A EASILY TO FIND OUT CON. U. LASTLY PART OF THE RACE IDEAS. WITH KNOWLEDGE AND THAT WE NEED TO. WALK BEFORE WE CAN RUN SO I LIKE TO WEAR THAT USED A MOMENT AGO ABOUT RATIONALIZING THE SYSTEM IN A LOT OF THAT WE IS FOUNDATIONAL. IN ORDER TO GET TO ALTERNATELY A MORE OUTCOME MORE VALUE BASED SYSTEM. RIGHT OKAY I KNOW THAT SOMETIMES IT'S THE LINE BETWEEN WHICH FIVE SO JUST TRY UNDERSTAND. WHERE WHAT WENT INTO THE RATE STUDY AND SO FORTH AND I READ SOME OF IT STARTS BLEEDING OVER A LITTLE BIT SO. WELL MAYBE WILL DO THE POTS HERE- TO BE WILL BRING UP OR STAKEHOLDERS AND THEN HAVE YOU COME BACK IN AND WE CAN START BUILDING MORE INTO WHAT. FOR DEPARTMENTS PLANE TO GO. WITH THE STUDY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS WE- LOOK FOR THEIR YOU BACK. OKAY SO LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANEL WE HAVE OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS- DR- CHILL ROGERS- USING VECTORED EARLY LEARNING INSTITUTE. LAURIE ANDERSON PRESIDENT CEO OF UNITED CEREBRAL PALSY WALKS INTO LISTEN TURN SANTA BARBARA. COUNTIES AND KEVIN WRATH EXACT ACTOR MINNOWS. OKAY WELCOME. YES WE CAN TAKE IN THAT ORDER UNLESS YOU WANT TO GO IN A DIFFERENT ORDER. ALRIGHT OKAY DOCTOR ROGERS WELCOME. OKAY SO GOOD MORNING- I AM DOCTOR MISTER ROGERS AND- SO I CAN TRY TO STAY WITHIN MY FIVE MINUTES I'M GOING TO READ TO YOU AND SO- PROJECTS FOR THAT- FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR ASKING THREE MINUTES CITY CAD MODELS BUT LACKS QUICK OKAY WILL HAVE MORE TIME FOR QUESTIONS SO YOU CAN SEE IS THAT- I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT SUCH AN IMPORTANT TOPIC. THE RATE STUDY PRESENTS IS ALWAYS THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY REFLECT ON HOW WE'VE ORGANIZED A DDS SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND HOW WE MEET THE NEEDS BOTH OF THOSE TO RECEIVE SERVICES IN THOSE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE MY AREA OF EXPERTISE IS SPECIFICALLY AROUND SERVICES TO INFANTS AND TODDLERS RECEIVING EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES ON THE FOUNDING PARTNER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE EARLY LEARNING INSTITUTE A VENDOR AGENCY PROVIDING SERVICES TO NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED FAMILIES AND SONOMA COUNTY. I'M ALSO CALIFORNIA'S AMBASSADOR TO THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL'S LEARN THE SIGNS ACT EARLY PROGRAM I'M OF. I A NUMBER OF FIRST COMMISSIONER. AND I HAVE FOUR GRAND CHILDREN ALL UNDER THE AGE OF FOUR ONE WHO CURRENTLY HAS AN I OFFICE BE IN AS A RECEIVING SERVICES. SO I AM HEAVILY INVESTED IN THIS. WE THE SERVICE PROVIDERS OF EARLY INTERVENTION ACROSS THE STATE HAVE ALWAYS MADE IT WORK WE SOMEHOW SOMEWAY FIND MANY FOR THE BABIES WERE SUPPOSED TO SERVE AND WHILE I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES ARE NOW BEING INCLUDED IN THE TEMPORARY RATE INCREASES SHOULD THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET PASSED I'M VERY. PROGRAMS ARE LOSING EXPERIENCED TEACHERS THEIR SHRINKING OR THEY'RE CLOSING UP ALL TOGETHER MY OWN PROGRAM LOS THREE VERY VALUABLE TEACHERS IN THE PAST YEAR ALL OF WHOM HAVE MOVED TO ARIZONA WHERE THE PAY IS HIGHER AND THE COST OF LIVING IS LOWER I'M NOT TELLING BUT ALREADY KNOW WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO INCREASE WAGES FOR PEOPLEIN THIS FIELD SO WE CAN KEEP THE ONES WE HAVE AN ATTRACT NEW TEACHERS AND WE NEED TO FIND IT QUICKLY AS OUR GOVERNOR IS PUTTING MORE MONEY THIS IS AN EARLY CHILDHOOD. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AB ELEVEN WHICH REQUIRES DEVELOPMENTAL AN EARLY CHILDHOOD SCREENING IN THE MEDICAL SYSTEM. AND WE'RE ALL THESE KIDDOS HEADED THEY'RE HEADED INTO EARLY INTERVENTION. A SYSTEM WHICH IS ALREADY FRANTICALLY TRYING TO KEEP PACE. IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A WELL THOUGHT OUT PLAN TO INCREASE FUNDING TO FIND CHILDREN WHO NEED SERVICES WITHOUT INCREASING FUNDING TO THE ACTUAL SERVICES. I'VE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME LOOKING AT THE RATE STUDY. BOTH THE FIRST VERSION AND NOW THE REVISED VERSION AS IT PERTAINS TO EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES. AS YOU KNOW THE FIRST VERSION CONTAINED MANY FLAWS AND EARLY INTERVENTION WAS ACTUALLY LEFT OUT OF THE RATE TEMPORARY RATE INCREASES. THE REVISED VERSION IS BETTER BUT IN MY OPINION THERE ARE STILL SIGNIFICANT ISSUES. I'LL TRY TO STAY OUT OF THE WEEDS WITH YOU. BUT THE E. EYES BUT BUT THE MOST GLARING THING FOR ME IS A PRODUCT THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT INDICATES A FULL TIME EARLY INTERVENTION SPECIALIST CAN BILL. LITTLE OF TWENTY HOURS A WEEK. AND CLIENTS I'VE EVER. HAVE A CAN THINGS FAMILIES WITH THE CHILD IS SPECIAL NEEDS MUST DEAL WITH. THERAPIES ILLNESSES DOCTOR APPOINTMENTS HOSPITALIZATIONS EXCITER. THE WAY WE SET UP THE PAYMENT SYSTEM. IS THAT IF WE DON'T SEE THE CHILD WE CAN'T BILL- ANNA PRODUCTIVITY FACTOR TWENTY THREE BILLABLE HOURS GIVEN THE TRANSLATES INTO CASE LOADS OF TWENTY FIVE TO TWENTY NINE CLIENTS. THIS IS NOT A REASONABLE EXPECTATION FOR A FORTY HOUR. WEEK WORKLOAD AND CERTAINLY NOT DOABLE IN THE ONE TO ONE HELP ME SETTING THE LAW REQUIRES. THE RATE STUDY ALLOWS A LOT TO PROXIMALLY FIVE HOURS PER WEEK OF DRIVE TIME THREE HUNDRED MINUTES. THAT'S TEAM MINUTES PER VISIT IF WE STAY WITH THEIR TWENTY THREE VISITS PER WEEK. WHICH IN OUR WORLD COUNTY IS NOT DOABLE AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE A BOY. SANDERS STE. I'M IT. VERSUS VERY VERY COMPLICATED. BUT COMPLICATED NOT MEAN BROKEN IT MEANS THAT WORKING WITH INFANTS AND TODDLERS IS NEW ONES. AND IT TAKES MORE TIME IN REALITY THAT ON PAPER. ANY PARENT WHO'S EVER TRIED TO GET OUT OF THE DOOR IN THE MORNING WITH A TODDLER KNOWS THIS. AND EVERYTHING TAKES LONGER THAN WE THINK IT WELL. ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT ISSUE FOR US IS THE PROPOSED RATES OCCUR IS A CRISIS SORRY ANOTHER SICK NEED ISSUES AT THE PROPOSED RATES. IS IT ACROSS THE BOARD ADMINISTRATION COSTS ALLOWANCE OF TWELVE PERCENT. I RUN A PRETTY TIGHT SHIP AND I STILL CAN'T GET OUR ADMIN COSTS DOWN BELOW FIFTEEN PERCENT. AND MORE TYPICALLY IT'S 18% LIABILITY AND PROPERTY INSURANCE WENT UP ALMOST 56% FOR US FROM NINETY TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN TO TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY. DUE PRIMARILY TO THE CONTINUING NATURAL DISASTERS IN OUR AREA. WORKERS COMP WENT UP 40% OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS RENT GOES UP 3% A YEAR IF. I COULD GO ON. WHEN I LOOK AT THIS PERCENTAGE AND I LOOK AT THE DAILY OPERATION COST OF TEN DOLLARS PER DAY PER FULL TIME EARLY INTERVENTION SPECIALIST I WONDER HOW LONG AGENCIES LIKE MINE WILL SURVIVE. ANY FROM SINGLE SINGULAR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS TO THE REGIONAL CENTER WILL BE THE ONLY SERVICE PROVIDERS LEFT. WHO CAN AFFORD TO WORK ON AT THE PROPOSED RATES. IT MIGHT SAVE MONEY BUT I BELIEVE IF WE LET THIS HAPPEN WE WILL BE LEFT WITH THE SYSTEM OF FRAGMENTED UNSUPERVISED AN UNSUPPORTED PROFESSIONALS. A LITTLE QUALITY CONTROL ONE MORE THING. THE RATE REFORM COMMITTEE DID A TREMENDOUS JOB AND THE CONSULTANTS PROVIDED US ALL WITH THE BASIC ROAD MAP. BUT NOW THAN MATT NEEDS WORK AND I BELIEVE IT NEEDS WORK FROM THE PROFESSIONALS WHO KNOW THEIR OWN TERRITORY ONE SUBCOMMITTEE THIS GOING TO DEAL WITH THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF CARE I DON'T BELIEVE CAN COME WITH UP WITH A QUICK IMPLEMENTATION SYSTEM. BUT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING SO I'M PROPOSING THAT YOU THINK ABOUT. IMPLEMENTATION SUBCOMMITTEES BASED ON THE SERVICE DELIVERY PROFESSIONALS IN THAT SYSTEM THE LEARNING CURVE WOULD BE LESS STEEP. OKAY THANK YOU AND AGAIN WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY QUESTIONS I WILL TELL YOU IS A PEDIATRICIAN TO SEIZE MEDI CAL PATIENTS OUT GET PAID FOR THE PATIENTS I SEE AN ASSET CANCELLATION RATES SO. HAVE YOU TALKED TO THE EIGHT CS ABOUT THIS TOO. SO ALL RIGHT THANK YOU WELCOME. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS LAURIE ANDERSON ON THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF UNITED CEREBRAL PALSY OF LOS ANGELES VENTURE AND SANTA BARBARA COUNTIES. YOU SEE P. LA IS ONE OF THE LARGEST PROVIDERS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE LA COALITION OF SERVICE PROVIDERS WHICH CONSISTS OF EIGHTEEN AGENCIES. WHO COLLECTIVELY SERVED MORE THAN TWENTY ONE THOUSAND OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS WITH DISABILITIES I ALSO SIT ON THE DS TASK FORCE AND THE FISCAL REFORM COMMITTEE. I COMMEND DDS AND DIRECTOR NANCY PARCHMAN FOR THE WORK ON THE RATE STUDY IN THE TRANSPARENCY THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. THE RATE STUDY IS A FAIR IS FAIRLY SOLID IN IN ALIGNMENT WITH HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. THIS REPORT DOES DOCUMENTED DEFICIT IN FUNDING OF COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES OF ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS I DO WANT TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATOR FOR RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE. AND MAKING AN INITIAL INVESTMENT INTO THE SYSTEM. WELL WE COULD USE THIS HEARING TO DISCUSS THE DETAILS OF THE STUDY I BELIEVE. WE MUST INSIST- WE MUST INSTEAD DISCUSS THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING A COMMITMENT TO BEGIN PROVIDING THESE NEEDED RESOURCES. WHAT WE KNOW WAS MORE THAN EIGHTY CENTS OF EVERY DOLLAR SPENT FOR COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES GOES DIRECTLY OUT OF TO THE WORKFORCE MOSTLY THE DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS. THE RATE STUDY DOES DOCUMENTED THAT MUCH OF THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS NECESSARY TO SLOW DOWN THE MIGRATION OF THE WORK FORCE FROM SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS TO WORKINGOTHER JOBS SUCH AS IN RESTAURANTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. IT IS NOW COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT THE TURNOVER RATE AMONG PROVIDERS IS APPROXIMATELY 45% EACH YEAR. FILLING AND RETAINING EMPLOYEES TO SPEAK TO SUPPORT PEOPLE SAFELY WHILE MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES IS A DAILY STRUGGLE FOR PROVIDERS. MY RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATOR EXCEPT AND ACT UPON THE RATE STUDY CONCLUSION. THAT A MAJOR INVESTMENT IS NECESSARY AND THAT WE FOCUS THOSE RESOURCES ON REBUILDING OUR SYSTEM. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND THIS REFORM WILL NOT HAPPEN ALL RIGHT. NEEDS TO BE A FULL PROCESS. FOR EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN THE STATE OF OREGON IS IN ITS FIFTH OUT OF THE SITE YOUR PLATE OF ENSURING ACCESS COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. FOR IT IT WILL THE BILL. THAT THINK THROUGH. KNOWING THAT THANK. TO BE TO ON THE STATE BUDGET IT IS VITAL THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS THAT DELIVER ON CALIFORNIA'S PROMISE. TO DELIVER SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND I THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO. THE CHIEF WELCOME. MORNING MY NAME IS KEVIN ROTH I'M THE CRIPS. NAME'S KEVIN RATHNAM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR MODELS AT MINUS WE EMPLOY OVER SIXTEEN HUNDRED DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS SERVING MORE THAN SIXTEEN HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS AND THE SAN FRANCISCO EAST BAY. I'M ALSO ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR THE CALIFORNIA SUPPORT LIVING NETWORK AND ON THE PATH FOR COLLABORATIVE. I'VE WORKED EXTENSIVELY ON THE STATE. A RATE STUDY AND BELIEVE IT'S A CRITICAL STEP TOWARDS NEEDED REFORM AND I WAS ASKED WHAT IS MY OPINION ON HOW TO MOVE THE RATE STUDY FORWARD. WELL THE REST OF THE CLEARLY SHOWED A HUGE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT IN SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES BUT IN SOME WAYS THE RATE STUDY WAS THE EASY PART OF REFORM. WE ALREADY KNEW THE SYSTEM WAS EMBARRASSING THERE'S ONLY UNDERFUNDED BUT NOW WE MUST DECIDE HOW TO PAY A NEW PATH FORWARD. AND CREATE A SYSTEM WITH ACCOUNTABLE AND MEASURABLE OUTCOMES. WE CAN'T JUST THROW MONEY AT A PROBLEM AND EXPECT BETTER RESULTS. WE NEED AND WE SUPPORT A STRATEGIC PLAN. A PLAN THAT WILL HELP ENSURE MONEY GOES TO QUALITY PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE QUALITY SERVICES. AND THAT'S OUR NEXT STEP DEVELOPING CLEAR AND CONSISTENT DEFINITIONS FOR QUALITY DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY SERVICES. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE. BUT THOSE DEFINITIONS DO NOT CURRENTLY EXIST AT THE STATE OR AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. YET THESE DEFINITIONS OF QUALITY SERVICES ARE NEEDED TO FORM A SYSTEM THAT HELPS THE STATE TARGET RESOURCES TOWARDS QUALITY PROGRAMS WITH PROVEN OUTCOMES AND HELP THE STATE UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS ACTUALLY PAYING FOR. THE METHOD FOR DEVELOPING QUALITY SERVICES HAS JUST BEEN DELIVERED TO THE SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE. THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARIES BEFORE YOU THIS METHOD WAS DEVELOPED TO THE CALIFORNIA SUPPORTED LIVING PAY PROJECT PERSON CENTERED ADVOCACY VISION AND EDUCATION. THIS PROJECTS PRIMARY FUNDERS THIS CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WE ARE GOING THROUGH A YEAR LONG PROCESS TO DEVELOP SERVICE OUTCOMES FOR PERSONAL AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO ALL SERVICES IN THE SYSTEM. WORKING WITH YOU IN THE STATE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN JUMP START THIS PROCESS SO THAT THE RATE STUDY CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN A TIMELY FASHION. WE CAN DO THAT BY DEFINING QUALITY SERVICES DEFINING QUALITY OUTCOMES MEASURING THE QUALITY BY COLLECTING AND ANALYZING USAGE DATA. DESIGNING OUTCOME BASED TRAINING AND STAFF CERTIFICATION. FOR DIFFERENT SERVICES AND TRAINING MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS. TECH SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS SUPERVISING STAFF MANAGEMENT AND MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME BASED SERVICE PROVISION. THESE MEASURES WILL HELP IMPROVE SERVICES BASED ON pPRINCIPLES. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. TO HELP IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL I FIND IDEOLOGY- SENATOR TADAS MEMBERS SUBCOMMITTEE BEING HERE SHE LAST YEAR SHE WAS THE ONE WHO CHAMPION ACTUALLY ADDITIONAL FUNDING BEYOND WHAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES THAT WE WERE ABLE SUCCESSFULLY GET INTO THE BUDGET SO THANK YOU CENTER TAUGHT OF FOR JOIN US- DID YOU. BEFORE I GO ON THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL. I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OTHER THAN IF YOU CAN PROVIDE ME WITH SOME INFORMATION REGARDING THE WORK GROUP AND TO WHAT EXTENT. OF I JUST BEEN HEARING A LOT FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN AND FOLKS DOWN THERE. I HAVE SEEN THAT THE FED. THAT THERE'S- NO REAL REPRESENTATION ON THE WORK WORK GROUP SO JUST WANTED TO SEE IF YOU COULD PROVIDE ME WITH SOME BACKGROUND ON THAT OR SOME FURTHER INFORMATION. JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THEIR SWITCH WORK GROUP ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT. ARE THE- WHAT THE WHAT THE FOCUS IS ON- THE B. B. RATES WALKED THE RIGHT SIDE THE RATE STUDY REGARDING- THAT INCLUDES THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE FISCAL YES AND- SYSTEM REFORM. YES SOME TRIED. ON A TASK FORCE IN I'VE- I DON'T KNOW EVERYBODY ON THE TASK FORCE BUT- I KNOW THAT THERE WAS- AT LEAST TWO OR THREE PEOPLE FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT ARE IN. IN THAT- GROUP BUT I THINK OF DIRECTOR PARCHMENT COULD SPEAK TO THAT MORE. OKAY RIGHT AND SHE'LL BE COMING BACK THE NEXT PANEL. ACTUALLY THE DOCTOR ROGERS SO I KNOW THAT- YOU MENTIONED SEVERAL ITEMS- RELATED TO EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES AND CERTAINLY- AS A FEATURE XIN I'VE REFERRED MANY PATIENTS TO EARLY INTERVENTION- SO SOME OF THE THINGS SO YOU KNOW WE HEARD FROM THE RATES DOWN FROM THE- FROM BURNS ASSOCIATES SOB AND SO MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU BROUGHT IT WILL- SUCH AS YOU SAID BRED TO YOU TALKED ABOUT. WELL PAID FOR THE PAY THE PEOPLE THAT UP IN THE OF NO SHOW REYES AND NOW TRAVELS SO FORTH WHY. WHY DO YOU THINK I MEAN SEC IT SEEMS LIKE THEY DID A PRETTY. THE BILL OF THE LARGE REPORT THEY LOOKED A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS SO WHAT WHAT WHAT HAPPENED I MEAN TO YOUR PERSPECTIVE I MEAN THE AND THEN THERE'S BEEN SOME STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK I PRESUME YOU IN SOME OF YOUR- COLLEAGUES HAVE PROVIDED THAT. BUT WHY DO YOU FEEL LIKE THAT THAT'S STILL NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED SO WHAT WITH THAT SO YOU DID MENTION ABOUT HAVING SERVICE PROVIDER IN TERMS OF THE TATIAN BUT EVEN. LEADING UP TO THIS ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE- CURRENT RATES THAT HE'S STILL NOT ADDRESSING THE FACTORS THAT LOOK THAT STORAGE RESTING THE ISSUES THAT YOU BROUGHT UP. TODAY I HAVE FROM WHERE I SIT RUNNING AN AGENCY. I WHAT I THINK HAPPENED IS THAT ONE THE RATE THE PROVIDER SURVEY WAS VERY VERY COMPLICATED. AND MANY PEOPLE WHO PROVIDE EARLY INTERVENTION- INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ARE WORD BEFORE YOU KNOW THE AB SEED WILL CHANGE THINGS. M. AND AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR IF YOU'RE A SINGLE PERSON WITH A SINGLE CASE LOAD YOUR OVERHEAD IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN AN AGENCY YOU ALSO HAVE VERY LITTLE. OVERSIGHT IF YOU WELL AND IN THE EARLY INTERVENTION WORLD THERE'S A LOT OF INDIVIDUAL VENDORS. THEN I'M PROBABLY LESS SO THAN AGENCIES THESE DAYS SO I THINK THAT'S ONE THING IS IF YOU QUERY AN INDIVIDUAL WHAT THEIR OVERHEAD IS IT LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT THAN AN AGENCY. WHO HAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF. CALIFORNIA LABOR A LOT OF FOLLOW SO I THINK THAT'S ONE THING I ALSO THINK PEOPLE WHO FILLED OUT THE SURVEY PERHAPS WERE NOT. IN MY CHAIR OF BEING IN CHURCH PLEASE. I'M VERY INTIMATE THE- RUNNING IN A- THEY WERE. PROFESSIONALS WELL MEANING BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW MANY KIDS CAN YOU SEE IN A WEEK WHAT IS THE PRODUCTIVITY FACTOR NEW LOOK AT WHAT A CASELOAD IS VERSUS WHAT YOU ACTUALLY COULD SEE WOULD BE LIKE ASKING YOU HOW MANY PATIENTS DID YOU SCHEDULE IN A WEEK BUT HOW MANY ACTUALLY SHOWED UP. AND THAT'S A DIFFERENT NUMBER AND I THINK THAT THE RATE STUDY WAS COMPLICATED ENOUGH WHERE VERY WELL MEANING PEOPLE FILLED IT OUT AND DIDN'T ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE BEING PASSED SO IN THE ROOM I MEAN BECAUSE THE FIRST VERSION OF THE RATE RECOMMENDATIONS IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE SECOND VERSION WHEN THERE WAS A LOT MORE INPUT. FROM FOLKS LIKE ME AND HEAVY DUTY IMPOSED AROUND WHAT WERE YOU LOOKING AT SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE DISCONNECTS BUT I ALSO THINK THAT- LIKE I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS EIGHT IN THE FIRST STUDY THAT AVERAGE RECOMMENDATION FOR PAYING AN EARLY INTERVENTION SO THIRTY SIX DOLLARS AN HOUR THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR AND IT WENT DOWN TO TWENTY NINE DOLLARS AN HOUR. YOU FOR USING LABOR STATISTICS EXCITER HOW COME IT WENT DOWN AND IN SOME OF THE OTHER FACTORS WHEN UP SO THERE'S JUST SOME QUESTIONS. I EARLY INTERVENTION IS A VERY STRANGE SORT OF CAR ABOUT OF THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM IT'S GOT A LOT OF RULES A LOT A LOT AS A LOT OF WAY OF DOING BUSINESS I AM NOT SAYING THAT EVERYTHING ELSE IS IN COMPLICATED BUT WHEN YOU REALLY LEAVE SUCH A CALM HATED SYSTEM IN THE RATE STUDY COMMITTEE THINGS. WHEN WE WERE OUR TO GET. WE CAN TRY TO SEARCH OF PROVIDE A WEEK BEING TO YEAH WILL GET YOU THE BEST GONNA GET YOU GUYS. THINK I. THE DILIGENCE BE OF THE- I'D THAT CAN. DE A REALLY GOOD JOB ESPECIALLY THE SECOND TIME AROUND BUT I THINK THE SYSTEM ITSELF HAS. SOME COMPLICATIONS THAT JUST SIMPLY CALM WITH BABIES. AND A LOT OF THOSE FACTORS WERE TAKING AND I'M GUESSING I'M NOT THE ONLY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR HE THINKS A REALISTICIN THE CURRENT WORLD WE LIVE IN. AND WE'RE A SMALL NONPROFIT WE DO THE VERY BEST WE CAN. OKAY OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW THE POLICY WISE WE LIKE TO KEEP THE OVERHEADS LOS FACET LAKE BUT WE ALSO WANT TO BE REASONABLE. DIAZ I MEAN DE LA AND OUT OF THIS IS MORE SPECIFIC TO EARLY INTERVENTION- BECAUSE YOU ALSO SEEM TO REFER TO THERE'S A TENSION ARE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. THE AGENCY FOLKS WHICH YOU ARE ONE OF AND YOU'RE SAYING BASICALLY HE INDIVIDUAL OYSTER CONTRACTORS OR RIGHT INDIVIDUAL PROFESSIONALS DON'T THINK TENSIONS THE RIGHT WORD I THINK THAT IT'S A IT'S A DIFFERENT OF COST. RIGHT IF OKAY I FIGHT HAVE TO PROVIDE AND WHAT IS A REASONABLE FORTY HOUR A WEEK JOB TO AN EMPLOYEE AND HOW WE BUILD CASELOADS AND WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE WHAT OUR SUPERVISION IS WHAT OUR TRAINING IS ALL OF THAT STUFF. AND YOU THE INDIVIDUAL CAN DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE AND YOU AVERAGE A CASELOAD OF TWENTY NINE BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU WANT TO WORK YOU WILL WORK OUT OF YOUR HOME SO YOU HAVE VIRTUAL EXPENSES HAVE. YOUR YOUR WORK LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT THAN AN AGENCY WORK IF THAT MAKES SENSE OKAY BUT I GUESS THAT A YES WILL. DO I GUESS WHEN WE GET TO THE YEAH THAT HE WILL SEE ME AT THE TOP OF IT IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT THE OVERALL WORK FORCES WERE THEY ARE. AND WHAT AND THEN HOW DO YOU MAY. LESS EFFECTIVE YOU KNOW USE OF. SO OKAY I AGREE ALL RIGHT AND THEN- I THINK I JUST GOT IT BUT- DISTRESSED YOU TALKING ABOUT- IN TERMS OF REFRAINED QUALITY- SO YOU SAID THAT THERE'S A- THERE'S AN ABSENCE OF SERVE QUALITY STANDARDS. OKAY TO DO CAN YOU ELABORATE A BIT ON THAT WELL- WHEN WE WERE PREPARING THE DOCUMENTS FOR- STARTING. STARTING OFF THE PAVE PROJECT. I DID A- RESEARCH I ACTUALLY FOLLOW THE REYES STUDIES REFERENCES BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE RIGHT THE RATE STUDY SAYS THERE'S AND- THERE'S NO CONSENSUS ON QUALITY. AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S A FALL WITH THE RATE STUDY BECAUSE THE RACE THAT HE WASN'T RIGHT CONTRACTED FOR THAT AND SO I STARTED WITH THEIR ARTICLES THAT THEY REFERENCED AND I. AND I DID A NATIONAL SEARCH AND I CHECKED IN WITH- STEVE AGAIN WHEN HE PRESENTED HIS HE HASN'T SEEN ANYTHING NEW- THERE. WHAT WHAT I BELIEVE IS THAT. TO SOME EXTENT- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FOCUS ON QUALITY IN THE MEDICAL FIELD AND- AND THERE'S BEEN LESS. LESS METHODOLOGY WORKED ON IN A- IT FOOD DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY SERVICES NOW IN TERMS OF QUALITY OF LIFE STUDY WE HAVE THE NATIONAL CORE INDICATORS. AND THAT'S VERY SUCCESSFUL BUT THAT'S FOCUSING ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE WHEN WE GET TO LOOKING AT WHAT IS A GOOD SERVICE. THE METHODOLOGY TENDS TO BREAK DOWN. AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IN ORDER BECAUSE WE WANT TO CLEAR STRUCTURE FOR OUR STRUCTURE CONVERSATIONS IN THE PAVE TASK FORCE WHAT WE'VE- WHAT WE'VE DONE IS. RE TOOLED- METHODOLOGY% FOR LOOKING OUT WHAT IS A QUALITY. DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY SERVICE AND I THINK THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE- MEDICAL MODEL WHICH IS LOOKING AT ILLNESSES AND DISEASES AND WHICH IS IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY AND THEN. TO SUPPORT SERVICES THAT DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES- SERVICES PROVIDE THERE IS THE METAPHORS MORE SUPPORT VERSUS CARE. ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE GOING FROM AN INSTITUTIONAL TYPE OF CARE TO COMMUNITY. TO COMMUNITY CARE AND SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE LOOKED AT WE DIVIDED UP THE SERVICE- THIS SERVICE DELIVERY WE DIVIDE UP SERVICE OUTCOMES INTO SERVICE DELIVERY WHERE THE SERVICE PROVIDER DELIVERS A SERVICE. AND WHAT THE- USER OF THAT SERVICE THE PERSON WITH THE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY WHAT THEY DO WITH THAT SERVICE TO ACHIEVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE GOALS. THAT THEY'RE INTERESTED IN SO WE DON'T ACTUALLY TELL PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES HOW TO LIVE WHAT WE DO IS WE MEASURE IF THAT SERVICE. ACTUALLY HELP THEM DO THAT AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE THINK WILL- GET THROUGH THIS IMPASSE AROUND WHEN QUALITY AND CAN FORM THE BASIS FOR VALUE BASED PURCHASING BUT WE CAN. DO VALUE TO A PERSON PURCHASING IF WE KNOW. WHAT WOULD PURCHASE. OKAY AND ACTUALLY. TOWARD END THAT WAS GOING TO ASK ABOUT THIS LEADING TO VALUE BASED FOR SO OUT THAT THREE DIFFICULT DO THAT BASE FOR. WE HAVE A IN IN IN IN THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY WE DRESS UP A LITTLE BUT WE ALSO HAVE A FULL DOCUMENT THAT WE SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE. THAT YOU COULD- REFERENCE THAT HAS SEVERAL PAGES ON VALUE BASED PURCHASING. OKAY ALL RIGHT. AND THEN- MISS ANDERSON I THINK GUIDE YOU CHECK. YEAR IN YOUR REMARKS CHIU FOCUSED ON THE UNDER FUNDING- BUT YOU ALSO MADE REFERENCE TO THE- WORK. TO IT. YOU KNOW YOU'RE- RIGHT I THINK WAS IT WAS A PUBLIC. IN I ALSO HAVE ABOUT AND WE'LL PRIDE GET BACK INTO IT WHEN WE TALK RESPONSE PUBLIC. SO IN YOUR MIND I MEAN DO YOU TALK ABOUT COMPETITION OBVIOUSLY WITH OTHER TYPES OF JOBS- WHAT SORT OF APPROACHES DO YOU THINK I SHOULD BE TAKEN BY THE- ARM IN TERMS OF TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS. DON'T THE RED ONE THE ORIGINAL CHARGES WHICH IS THE WORK FORCE TO. SO THERE'S BEEN SOME PEOPLE COMMENTING THAT WE DIDN'T SUPPORT DIDN'T REALLY DEAL WITH THE WORKFORCE ISSUES AS MUCH AS WE'D LIKE IT TO OUR- DEAL WITH IT- SO. WHAT IN YOUR MIND WOULD BE SOMETHING YOU'D THINK THAT THE PART AND ARE THE ARE A BURNS ISSUE SHOULD DO TO BETTER ADDRESS THE WORKFORCE ISSUES ARE ARE YOU SATISFIED-WITH HOW MUCH DATE. DID I'M GUESSING IT AND SINCE YOU MENTIONED IT BUT- THE- LA YOU TALK THREE A FOR YOURSELF. YEAH NO YOU KNOW I. THE OVERALL STOCK I IT WAS SOUTH I MEAN. THERE'S ALWAYS THINGS THAT YOU KNOW FROM A PROVIDER'S POINT IF YOU WERE GONNA SAY. WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE. IT ON OUR END BUT I THINK OVERALL IT IS SOLID. THE WORK FORCE ISSUE IS A PROBLEM NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT IT IS NATIONALLY. AND YOU KNOW HIGHER WAGES IS ALWAYS GOING TO. YOU KNOW HELP THE SITUATION. BUT I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THE TYPE OF WORK AND WHAT OTHER SPORTS WE CAN PUT IN PLACE. FOR THE T. S. P.'S ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE T. S. P.'S. RIGHT THAT. HELLO AT IT. MORE AS A BIGGER PICTURE THAN YOU KNOW JUST THE WAGES BUT THE WAGES ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. OKAY. TO OPEN THE TWENTY SURE WE TOUCHED ON THAT. WHAT I MEAN WHAT I WANT WHEN THE THINGS WITH US TO TALK ABOUT TERMS OF TRYING TO STRENGTHEN WORKFORCE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE TO ORGANIZE AND- UNION ICE. COSTS MONEY YES WELL NOW I MEAN WELL THAT'S- THEN THEY CAN ADVOCATE FOR THEMSELVES FOR MORE RESOURCES. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SAYS. DISCUSSED YEAH I THINK THE STUDY DIDOT TOUCH ON THE OF THE DIFFERENT DSP LEVELS AND THE COMPETENCIES OF THE T. S. P.'S AND ALLOWING THEM TO MOVE FORWARD THAT WAY WITH- YOU KNOW IMPROVEMENTS- YOU KNOW IT'S AN UPPER LEVEL SO MOVING FORWARD WITH- THEIR JOBS IN THE TIERED LEVELS. RIGHT ANY OTHER ONES. OUR WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOU PRESENT AND REALLY APPRECIATE- YOUR INPUT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU OKAY. SO WE'RE GONNA BRING BACK- REGULAR BARGE MEN AND- MISTER PULASKI FOR- AND ALSO JAKE FOR FROM DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND BRENT HAUSER FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M SURE FINANCES RAY HEARD THE MONEY QUESTIONS ABOUT BRADY. SO SAYS THE OVERVIEW TO RESPONSE PUBLIC COMMENTS AND NEXT STEPS AND I KNOW THAT. I THINK- I THINK THE LAST TIME WE LEFT THIS CONVERSATION WAS IS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON IT- BECAUSE WE HAD THE STUDY SO- LOOKING FORWARD NOW TO THE WHAT HAVE YOU COME UP WITH- SO WHAT IF PEOPLE SAID WE COME UP WITH SO THANK YOU AND- WELCOME BACK. THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN US SENATOR DADA- SO THE AS IT THERE'S REALLY BEEN- REALLY HELPFUL CONVERSATION TODAY TO LEAD INTO THE- REPORTING OUT TO YOU AS FAR AS THE PROCESS OF THE COMMENTS BUT I THINK. RIGHT NOW LET'S GO AHEAD AND WE'LL WE'LL HAVE IT TO HAVING MISTER PULASKI PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW AS TO WHAT WERE THE COMMENTS AND THEN TAKING A LOOK AT THE APPROACH. IN UPDATING THE RIGHT MODELS AND THEN ULTIMATELY THEN ANSWERING A COUPLE THE QUESTIONS REGARDING KIND OF THAT THIS CALL PIECE TO IT. BUT THEN I'M HAPPY TO CIRCLE. AND HOW PER SE REGARDING THE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE IN THE AGENDA TO TALK ABOUT NEXT STEPS TO WORK AT THE SYSTEM AND FISCAL REFORM. AND I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT I- RESPOND TO THE SENATOR'S QUESTION REGARDING THE CENTRAL VALLEY- A REPRESENTATION. SO I'M WITH AT ALL I'LL GO AHEAD AND HANDED OVER TO. KLAUS THANK YOU CAN RESEARCH SIMPLY WITH MISTER. AS WITH THE OVERVIEW THE RAY SORRY I THOUGHT I WOULD SPEND A FEW MINUTES BRIEFLY TALKING ABOUT THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE SINCE WE LAST GOT TOGETHER AFTER WE PUBLISHED THE RATE STUDY MARCH VERSES THE- UPDATE AND FINALIZE RATE MODELS PUBLISHED EARLIER THIS MONTH. AND SO THE PUBLIC COMMENT PROCESS WAS CERTAINLY A LARGE PART OF THAT BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY THREE COMPONENTS OF CHANGES THAT WE MADE TO BOTH THE RATE MODELS AS WELL AS THE FISCAL IMPACT ANALYSIS ON. TAKE BOTH OF THOSE ALL THREE THE- SAME TURN. SO FIRST WE MADE A NUMBER OF METHODOLOGICAL CHANGES IN TERMS OF HOW WE ARE FORECASTING COSTS AND WILL GO INTO MORE DETAILS ABOUT THIS- WHEN WE GET TO SOME OF YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE AGENDA WHEN YOU'RE QUESTIONS WAS ABOUT THE OVERALL COST IMPACT AND HOW THAT HASN'T CHANGED SINCE. WHAT WE PUBLISH BACK IN MARCH BUT- HAS DRUG DEPARTMENT ALLUDED TO EARLIER IN HER REMARKS. THAT REALLY IS A FUNCTION OF US HAVING ACCESS TO MORE RECENT CLAIMS DATA. THAT ALLOWED US TO UPDATE OR FOR CASTING TRANSIT THE SERVICES THAT. THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD RECEIVE LARGE INCREASES FOR THE RACE A MAN COMMITTED ARE GROWING AT A SLOWER PACE THAN THE STUFF. THE SERVICE CODES. THAT WE GET A GLASS. OF MORE MODERATE INCREASE- IF THE RACIALLY WERE TO BE IMPLEMENTED SO WE SEE A SHIP FROM- ONE GROUP OF SERVICES TO ANOTHER GROUP OF SERVICES. WE ALSO MADE SOME TECHNICAL CHANGES TO HOW IT IS WERE FORECASTING ESTIMATED COSTS MISCELLANEOUS SERVICE CODES- AND THAT'S A TERM OF ART THAT'S USED IN DDS FOR A HANDFUL THE SERVER NUMBER SERVICE BECAUSE IT DON'T HAVE. A LOT OF REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. WHICH POSES OF A CHALLENGE FOR US BECAUSE WITHOUT A- STANDARDIZED DEFINITION OR APPROACH TO REVERSING THOSE SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE. WE HAVE TO MAKE A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE AVERAGE RATE IS AND HOW THAT WOULD CHANGE BASED UPON. THE RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDED IN THE RATE STUDY. AND WE ALSO MADE AGAIN SOME CHANGES RELATED TO HOW DOES WERE FORECASTING THE PERCENTAGE OF COMMUNITY BASED A PROGRAMS THAT WOULD QUALIFY FOR HIGHER RATES FOR HAVING A MEDICAL OR BEHAVIORAL FOCUS SO. WE THINK THEY'LL BE LESS OF THOSE PROGRAMS AND WE ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED. SO THOSE MYTHOLOGICAL CHANGES ALL RELATED TO HOW WE WERE DOING THE FISCAL IMPACT ANALYSIS THEY DIDN'T CHANGE THE RATE MODELS PER SE. THE SECOND GROUP OF CHANGES WE MADE TO THE- PACKAGE WE DELIVERED BACK IN MARCH WHERE WHAT I REFER TO AS TACTICAL ADJUSTMENTS. SO ONE OF THOSE TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE EARLIER PANEL AND THAT SIMPLY COUNTY FOR MORE DATA THAT'S BECOME AVAILABLE SINCE WE PUBLISHED THE STUDY BACK IN MARCH SO. THERE'S BEEN NEW DEAL BLS DATA PUBLISHED. THE IRS PUBLISHED ITS STANDARD MILEAGE RATE FOR TWENTY TWENTY THE W. C. I. R. B. PROVIDED UPDATED FORECAST FOR THE- PREMIUM RATES FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY SO WE- AT A TIME WE HAD ACCESS TO MORE CURRENT DATA. WE WANTED TO USE THE MOST COURT CURRENT OUT AVAILABLE TO US AN UPDATE THREE MODELS. THERE ALSO AT THE HANDFUL OF CORRECTIONS WE HAD TO MAKE TO THE RATE MODELS ON THAT THREE THOUSAND PAGE PACKAGE OR WHAT ONE OR TWO FORMULAE THAT WERE- ABRONIA SO SOME FOLKS. SOME OF THOSE WERE POINTED OUT TO US BY COMMENTERS OTHERS WE- FOUND AS WE CONTINUE TO. WORK TO FINALIZE THOSE REMODELS. AND FINALLY OF COURSE WE MADE A NUMBER OF CHANGES TO THE RAM MODELS THE RESPONSE OF PUBLIC COMMENT SO METHODOLOGICAL CHANGES IMPACT TO THE FISCAL IMPACT. TACTICAL ADJUSTMENTS IMPASSABLE TERRAIN MODELS AS WELL AS THE FISCAL IMPACT ANALYSIS IN THE WITH CHANGES RESPONSE PUBLIC COMMENTS WHICH COULD RESULT. IN CHANGES TO THE MODELS THEMSELVES. I WILL GO THROUGH ALL OF THOSE AS I SAID THERE WERE LITERALLY DOZENS OF CHANGES MADE IN RESPONSE TO PUBLIC COMMENTS. ON BECAUSE WE'RE BIG ON PUBLISHING LENGTHY DOCUMENTS WE HAVE ANOTHER HUNDRED PAGE DOCUMENT THAT OUTLINES THE- TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR SO. INDIVIDUAL INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE PUBLIC COMMENTS THAT WE RECEIVED. AND THE DEPARTMENT'S RESPONSE EACH AS WELL AS- AN EXPLANATION OF THE CHANGE THAT WE MADE RESPONSE THAT COMMENTS OR- OUR RATIONALE FOR NOT MAKING A CHANGE FOR THOSE COMMENTS THAT DO NOT PRODUCE ANY UPDATES TO THE RATE MODLS. BUT I JUST WANT TO TOUCH UPON A HANDFUL THE CHANGES THAT WE MADE SOME OF THOSE HIGH LEVEL ADJUSTMENTS. SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT IN MARCH AND OUT CAME UP AGAIN IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL WAS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS. FOR A NUMBER THE SERVICES REACHED MISSED OUR APPROACH TO ESTIMATING THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ME THE AVERAGE WAGE ASSOCIATE WITH THOSE DSPS AND- FOR SERVICES LIKE INDEPENDENT LIVING DAY PROGRAMS WE INCREASED. THOSE WAGE ASSUMPTIONS- SIMILARLY WEEK WE INCREASE THE WEIGHT ASSUMPTION FOR SUPPORT OF EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AS WELL. WE ARE OVER TIME ASSUMPTIONS TO A NUMBER OF SERVICES THAT TWENTY FOUR HOUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR INDIVIDUAL SO SERVICES. LIKE RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS IN SUPPORT OF LIVING. WE MADE A NUMBER OF CHANGES TO THE RATE MODELS FOR FAMILY HEALTH AGENCY IN RESPONSE TO COMMENTS WE RECEIVE THAT RESULTED IN INCREASING THOSE RATES TO ENSURE THAT REMAINS A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE. HOPEFULLY ACROSS THE STATE SINCE THAT'S REALLY A PAVE THE MOST HOME LIKE SETTING FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LIVING OUTSIDE OF THEIR THEIR BIRTH HOMES- BUT GETS SMOTHERED ADJUSTMENTS WE MADE TO THE DAY PROGRAM RIGHT MODEL RE REDUCE THE ASSEMBLY TENDONS RATES. HANDS WELL AS WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE- PREVIOUS PANEL THAT I WAS ON WE ALSO. PULLED BACK ON SOME OF THE- PROPOSALS INCLUDED IN THE MARCH RATE MODEL SO. WE DROPPED THE TIMING OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES THE MEDICARE FEE SCHEDULE. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CHANGES THAT WE PROPOSE RELATED TO EMPLOY A RECORD SERVICES. HAVE BEEN PLAYER RECORD RESPITE SERVICES. AS WELL AS TRANSPORTATION SERVICES WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO. AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER- CONSOLIDATE SOME SERVICE CODES THAT BASED UPON THE FEEDBACK THAT WE RECEIVE WE- THOUGHT ABOUT THAT A SECOND TIME AND THEN. DECIDED PERHAPS WAS NOT THE BEST PATH FOR TO CONSOLIDATE SOME OF THOSE SERVICES. FOR A COUPLE OF OTHER MISCELLANEOUS SERVICE CODE AGAIN THE SERVICE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A REGULATORY- OF A DETAILED REGULATORY BACKING- WE DECIDED NOT TO MOVE FOR WITH SOME OF PROPOSALS THAT WE HAD. RATHER WE THOUGHT OF MORE AND TO FOR DEVELOPER. AND THEN BUILD RATE THE REFLECTS THOSE. RECOMMENDATIONS SO THAT POLICY IS DRIVING THE RATES RATHER THAN THE OPPOSITE SO WE DON'T WANT TO PROPOSED CHANGES TO. THE CREATIVE ARTS PROGRAMS WHICH IS ONE OF THE GROUPS PROVIDERS YOU HEARD ABOUT HER FROM BACK IN MARCH CRISIS SERVICES. AND THE SOCIALIZATION TRAINING PROGRAMS. LAST MARK I WANTED A MAY COME JUST REITERATE THE POINT I MADE IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL AS WITH ALL THESE ADJUSTMENTS WE NOW BILL RATE MODEL SO CONTINUE REFLECT WE THINK OF THE APPROPRIATE COSTA SO SHE WAS DELIVERING THE SERVICES. AS OF JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY SO AS OF A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. IF THE STATE WERE TO MOVE FOR WITH IMPLEMENTATION YOU WANT TO. TAKE A SECOND LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE ASSUMPTIONS TO CONTINUE TO ACCOUNT FOR. I'M GOING INCREASES IN COSTS SINCE. THIS THIS MONTH THAT WERE IN CURRENTLY. THANK YOU. JIM ANYMORE SO THANK YOU SENATOR PAN SO TO- MOVE FORWARD AND TALKING TO SOME OF THE POINTS IN THE QUESTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- ADDRESS THOSE AS FAR AS THOSE NEXT STEPS FORWARD- TO THE QUESTION AS FAR AS THE SYSTEM IN FISCAL REFORM- REGARDING REPRESENTATION I WANT TO TOUCH ON THAT- THE WORK THAT WE DID WITH THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TASK FORCE IN THE PAST IT WAS REALLY ABOUT TRANSITIONING INDIVIDUALS FROM THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AND CHANGE IN OUR SYSTEM FROM THIS STATE OPERATED DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS. NO SERVICES TO REALLY BE IN A FULLY COMMUNITY BASED- SERVICE SYSTEM AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE REALLY NEED TO RECONSTITUTE THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TASK FORCE SO WE DID THAT WE DID A BY APPLICATION AND WE HAVE FIVE DIFFERENT WORK GROUPS ON THE AREAS IN WHICH WE REALLY SAW THE PRIORITY AND MAKING SURE THAT WE REPRESENTED FAMILIES INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE THE DIVERSITY OF THE INDIVIDUALS AND MEETING DIVERSITY THE NEEDS OF THE CONSUMERS AND THE FAMILIES BUT ALSO GEOGRAPHICALLY- BUT I'M GOING TO GO BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT. YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY WITHIN THE SYSTEM AND WE'RE FROM WORKGROUP I BELIEVE WE DO HAVE A REPRESENTATION TO THE NUMBER I'M NOT SURE SO I WILL FOLLOW BACK UP WITH YOU- AND IF WE FEEL THAT WE DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE REPRESENTATION WE CAN CERTAINLY OPERATORS AT THAT MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE DO IT. CALIFORNIA'S A LARGE AND PRINT PARTS OF THE STATE HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE VOICE OF THOSE SAID THAT THAT REALLY A RECEIPT AND SERVICE AS SO WHAT WILL HAVE CIRCLE WITH. THANK YOU SO WHEN WE A LOOK THE RATES AND THE DATED- STUDY AND MOVING FORWARD YOU KNOW THAT REALLY FOUND TIONAL RIGHT NOW TAKE A LOOK AT THE RATES HE WAS VERY AND INFORMATIVE IN OUR PROCESS NOT ONLY BE ON WORK THAT WAS FIRE CONSULTANT BUT THEN PUT BASED ON THE ENGAGEMENT WE HAD WITH OUR COMMUNITY BASED ON THE AND- PER PROVIDE TO US BUT ALSO WITH FAMILY. I THE FOR WHAT ARE THINGS ARE CRITICAL ON MAKING SURE YOU WERE HAVE A DISK SO REFORMS. FOUND A AND SO. ATTY AND THEN WHAT ARE WE PAYING FOR YOU KNOW ARE WE PYING FOR THOSE OUTCOMES SO HAVING THAT THAT CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW IS REALLY REALLY CRITICAL- WE'VE BEEN DOING SOME OF THOSE BUILDING BLOCKS ALL ALONG WITH THAT WORK WITH THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICE TASK FORCE STARTING THIS SUMMER WE ACTUALLY STARTED HAVING SMALLER WORK GROUP DISCUSSIONS WELL WE FORMALISE THE WORK GROUP AND WE HAD OUR FIRST MEETING THIS THIS. MONTH I THINK WE'RE STILL IN JANUARY SO WE HAD THAT OUR FIRST MEETING THAT WASN'T THE ONLY TIME WE HAD THE CONVERSATION SO WE MET WITH FAMILIES WE MET WITH DIFFERENT ASSOCIATIONS WE HAD SMALLER WORK GROUPS TO REALLY TALK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER- REALLY WHAT INFORMED US IN OUR PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WHICH AS AS NOTED THAT WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT MOVING FORWARD. BUT THERE ARE SOME VERY KEY CRITICAL THINGS THAT WE HAVE PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SO IT DOES INCLUDE BUILDING ON THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATE INCREASE TAKING THE INFORMATION FROM THE UPDATE OF THE RATE STUDY IN THE RATE MODELS RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF- CHILDHOOD SERVICES SO WITH THE EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICE CODE THE THERAPEUTIC- SERVICES AND THEN ALSO TAKING A LOOK AT- INDEPENDENT LIVING SO PRIORITIZING KNOWS ADDING THOSE INTO THE PROPOSAL OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATE INCREASE SO THAT IS PROPOSED ADDITIONALLY REALLY GETTING SOME FOUNDATIONAL WORK ON TAKING A LOOK AT HOW DO WE TIE OUTCOMES. AND PAYMENT SO NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF TAKING A LOOK AT- SERVICE RIGHT STORE PROVIDERS WE'VE BEEN DOING THE WORK WITH THE RIGHT STUDY WE'VE DONE THE WORK WITH THIS. I'M RATE JOE WE TO CA TO AT TO DO SIR TO RE CENTER ONE THE WAY. OTHER STATES HAVE LONG AT. IS THE AND HOW ARE WE DOING THAT CASE CORD. AND THAT. THE LAW COUPLE YEARS FOCUS BECAUSE IT ON THE IMPORT WORK UP OVERSTATE ACCOUNTED. AND WITH REGIONAL CENTERS. I'M TO BUILD ON THAT SO IN ADDITION TO OUR REORGANIZATION IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE ALREADY BEEN DOING. REALLY TAKING THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO SAY WHAT ARE THOSE THOSE FOUNDATIONAL OUTCOMES THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE ASKING TO BE ABLE TO IMPROVE. IMPROVE AND HAVE THE BEST QUALITY OF LIFE AND THEN HOW ARE WE GOING TO MEASURE WHAT MATTERS. SO RIGHT NOW THE SYSTEM IN FISCAL- REFORM WORKGROUP I'VE ASKED HIM TO REALLY FOCUS ON THIS WITH US. SO WE CAN REALLY IMPLEMENT SOMETHING IN A VERY TIMELY WAY. SO IF WE ARE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROPOSAL OF THAT PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE. I'M PROGRAM IT REALLY IS GOING TO BE FOUNDATIONAL FOR US TO MOVE THE SYSTEM TO A- ADVANCE THOSE DISCUSSIONS. IN TIENE SOMETHING THAT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST. WE ALREADY HAVE THE PERFORMANCE CONTRACTS THAT WERE ABLE TO WORK ON. AND WE'LL TALK SOME MORE ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW IS A YEAH WITH THE BUDGET PROCESS. BUT AGAIN THAT FOUNDATIONAL WORK WITH THE SYSTEM AND FISCAL REFORM DISCUSSIONS I THINK WILL BE REALLY CRITICAL- SO. THEN MOVING TO MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. I'M THE GOALS OF THE GROUP REALLY IT WILL THEN BE HAVING CON. BOTH ON. KIND OF THOSE NEXT STEPS FORWARD GIVING US RECOMMENDATIONS AND SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH ANY. ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAVE WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THEN ALSO WHETHER- STAKEHOLDERS. THAT WE HAVE THAT FOUNDATION FOR THOSE THOSE DISCUSSION POINTS. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY AND I THINK WE STILL HAVE SOME MORE QUESTIONS HERE THAT I THINK YOU'LL GET TO. SO NOW THE RATE STUDY. TO QUIT THREE YEARS RIGHT AND- AND I THINK IT. WAS INITIATED BEFORE I BECAME CHAIRED THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND JUST REMEMBER EACH TIME. COME UP THEN WHILE WE WERE WAITING FOR THE RIGHT SAY WAIT TODAY'S RATE SAY NOW WE HAVE THE RATE STUDY. AND I GUESS WHAT ONE OF THE QESTIONS IS THAT OKAY SO WHAT I'M HEARING IS WE HAVE THE RIGHT STUDY WE'VE UPDATED WE HAVE IN YOU. KNOW UPDATED RATE STUDY FOR. JANUARY ITS BENCHMARK FOR STARTING IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY RIGHT MID YEAR RATE THAT'S- THE UNITED RECONSTITUTED THIS. TASK FORCE WERE HAVING THESE DISCUSSIONS. AND I APPRECIATE THE ENGAGEMENT. AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. BUT I THINK ALSO HEARING THAT WELL. JUST BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T DO SOMETHING MORE AND SO. A SO I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU IS THAT SO WHAT ARE WE DOING IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY TRYING TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE PAYMENT MODELS ALSO MADE MENTION NOW AND AGAIN I WANT RECOGNIZE THAT THE THIS BUDGET IS THAT THE IN DOLLAR OR MORE THIS YEAR THAN. LAST YEAR SO I MIKE KNOWLEDGE I SAID THAT IN THE VERY BEGINNING I THINK SIX HUNDRED SOMETHING IN THE GENERAL FUND- BUT SOME OF THAT'S MORE CASELOAD RELATED SO IT'S NOT NECESSARY AND THEN OF COURSE WE DO HAVE SOME SOME TARGETED RATE INCREASES BUT WE ALSO KNOW FROM THE RATE STUDY THAT WERE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS SHORT NOW. WE COULD BE RE STILL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RESTRUCTURING SOMETHING'S BUT LETS YOU TELLING ME THAT I A WRONG I LIVE FEELING THAT EVEN IN THE RESTRUCTURING AND WE MOVED TO VALUE BASED WHATEVER I'M NOT SURE WE'RE GOING TO BE REDUCING THE DEMAND. THE NEED BY ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION SO HE'S SPEAK SO WE HAVE THE STUDY NOW. LAST SPRING UPDATED YOUR HAD PROVIDER IN AT THE YEAH PUBLIC COMMENT IT CETERA- WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP- SO I KNOW THERE'S SOME BUDGETARY STUFF THAT I'VE SEEN IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND WE MAY BE HEARING MORE IN OUR BUDGET THANK HEARINGS BUT WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT'S PLAN TO START. AND THINGS SOME OF THESE THREE ADULTS AND ALSO- AND WE ARE FINANCE YOUR MAY CON IS THAT OKAY I MEAN I SEE WHAT GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING BUT IT'S SEEMS LIKE THE- STILL. DOES IT. NOT QUITE CLOSING THE GAP. RIGHT AND THAT THAT THE GAP THAT THE DEBATE STUDY AND THAT OF. AND EVEN IF DO REFER. MY IS THAT NOT GOING TO CALL. THAT'S GO TAKE CARE OF THE GAP EITHER SO CAN SPEAK TO LIKE OKAY NOW WE HAVE THE STUDY WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH IT. I THINK IT THAT. THE RATE STUDY DID A NUMBER OF THINGS FOR US AND IT IT'S CERTAINLY OUTLINES- THE ADDRESS THE AREAS IN WHICH- IT WAS ASKED TO DO YOU KNOW LOOKING AT ON THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR SYSTEM TAKING A LOOK AT REALLY WHAT IT BUILDING A RATE MODEL THAT COULD BE TRANSPARENT AND ALL OF THOSE PIECES. THE OTHER THING THAT THE RATE STUDY DID FOR US IN ADDITION TO IDENTIFYING THOSE THOSE ELEMENTS OF IT IT ALSO IDENTIFIED THEM IF WE WERE TO IMPLEMENT THERE WERE CERTAIN STRUCTURES THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REALLY EVALUATE AND SEE HOW TO MOVE FORWARD WHETHER IT'S STATUTE REGULATION LOOKING AT WAIVER YOU KNOW AMENDMENTS WAIVER APPLICATIONS THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS BUT THE OTHER PIECE THAT IT DID IT REALLY HAD US TAKE A STEP BACK IN ADDITION TO. KIND OF THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING BUT THEN WHAT ARE THOSE TRENDS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN OUR SYSTEM THAT WE STILL NEED TO IDENTIFY IT TELLS US THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK VERY CLOSELY AND TO OUR SYSTEM AS I SAID EARLIER NOT MINIMIZING IMPORT OF TAKING A LOOK AT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S SOME RELIEF CERTAINLY LAP AT. THAT WOULD TAKEN THE MINISTER ALLEGE. TO OF. IT HAVING THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATED. WE DOES EQUAL TO FOR HUNDRED MILLION OVER TO. YOU KNOW OF GENERAL FOR. YOU KNOW HAVING THAT INVEST IS WAS A STEP STONE. AT THOSE THREE TO SERVE CODES YEAR IS ANOTHER STEPPING STONE IN IN AND PRIORITIZING THOSE AREAS AS FAR AS THE- SERVICES TO CHILDREN AS WELL AS TO AN H. CBS COMPLAINTS BECAUSE THE INDEPENDENT LIVING SKILLS BECAUSE GET TO THAT. BUT THE OTHER PIECES SAYING WAIT WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE SYSTEM AND FISCAL REFORM SIDE OF IT. AND THE PAYMENT- THE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS IT REALLY IS FOUNDATIONAL TO THAT. THAT DISCUSSION AND THOSE NEXT STEPS AS WE'VE TALKED TO OTHER STATES AS WE REALLY EVALUATED. AS FAR AS HOW DO YOU IMPLEMENT SYSTEM CHANGE IT IS AN ITERATIVE PROCESS THAT DOES TAKE TIME. AND HAVING AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPLEMENT A VALUE BASED INCENTIVE PROGRAM RIGHT NOW THAT WE CAN DO WITHIN THE REGIONAL CENTERS. REALLY DOES TAKE US A STEP TOWARDS. OUR NEXT STEPS TO SYSTEM CHAINS- SO THOSE ARE THE STEPS IT IS PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THOSE ARE THE STEPS THAT WERE TAKING. BEING INFORMED BY THE RATE STUDY BEING INFORMED BY THAT PUBLIC INPUT THAT WE'VE HAD AND TAKING THOSE PRIORITIES- WE WILL HAVE TO GO AHEAD AND APPLY FOR. A WAIVER AMENDMENT IT WAS NOTED FOR THOSE THREE DIFFERENT SERVICE CODE SO IT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED- FIRST PART OF JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY. ONE FOR THOSE THREE SERVICE. SO I GUESS. APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING- MORE THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS THAT- SO YOU COULD BE DOING THINGS BUT- I MEAN IT THE PLANET A TIME LINE BECAUSE I THINK- THAT THAT HELPS KEEP EVERYONE ACCOUNTABLE AND- TO SAY LIKE OKAY WELL AND- BE ABLE PERHAPS- BY TIME BY. YOUR BACK UP HERE AGAIN DIDN'T READ FOR US TO BE THAT WOULD PRECEDE HAVING AT TIELINE SAYING OKAY WE YEAH WE GOT THREE STAY LAST SPRING WE GOT PUBLIC AND CUT A SAID YOU'RE STARTING TO BUT RELEASE ARE LIKE OKAY WELL. YOU SAID THERE'S A CERTAIN THE OTHERS RIGHT DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES ARE INVOLVED IN THIS. BUT WHAT POINT DO WE EXPECT. LIKE OKAY FINE WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH ABOUT. WHAT'S THE TIMELINE FOR FORGETTING OF THEIR MAYBE YES ADVENTURE WAIVERS AND SO FORTH. SO WHAT IS THE TIMELINE FOR US TO GET TO WHERE YOU WANT TO GET TO- YOU KNOW WITHIN SPECIFIC SPENT THREE YEARS ON THIS RATE STUDY RIGHT- AND- LOOKED A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND THAT WE'VE HAD ANOTHER. SIX MONTHS TO GET PEOPLE TO GIVE THEIR FEEDBACK SO FOURTH WE SHOULD SERVICE BE ABLE TO SKETCH OUT A AND YOU SAID OKAY WE GOT THESE DIFFERENT THINGS WERE LOOKING AT AND I GOT I- IF PROCESS BUT THERE'S GOT IT IS THE- THERE'S GOAL OR GETTING TO AND I MEAN I GUESS. FLAT OUT I MEAN WHO ARE WE PLANNING TO IMPLEMENT- REALIZING THAT THERE'S GONNA BE ADJUSTMENTS AND SO FORTH MADE I MEAN ARE WE EMBRACING THIS THE SIZING OUR GOAL IS TO GET TO. YOU KNOW GET- SOME VERSION OF THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE PAYMENT MODELS WITH THAT WHAT THE CODE SO THAT WE A RATIONALIZED PAYMENT- WE'RE GOING TO YOU KNOW GET AIMED AT TRYING TO GET THE AND WE HAVE ECONOMIC THINGS AT THE DEAL WITH THAT AIM TO GET TO SOME LEVEL OF FLEECE FULL FUNDING AT YOU KNOW IT CERTAIN SOME POINT TIME OUT IN THE FUTURE- BASED ON- BASED ON THE METHODOLOGY I MEAN UNLESS WE DON'T BELIEVE THE METHODOLOGIES CORRECT. AT AGE THAT SERVE TOLD US WHAT WE NEED TO AND SOME OF THAT WILL OF COURSE BE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS YOU KNOW. ADJUSTMENTS YOU MAY MAKE YOU KNOW IN THE INTERIM BUT THAT THERE IS THAT THAT IS SOMETHING WE ARE SETTING AS A GOAL AND AN DEL EX NUMBER YEARS THREE YEARS OR WHATEVER I'M JUST SELL EX NUMBER YEARS WE PLANT WOULD GO TRY TO GET THERE- I. SO I THINK THAT. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THE DEPARTMENT CAN CAN CAN CAN DO AND PERHAPS PERCENT- IN MARCH I GUESS IS WHEN YOU'LL PROBABLY BE BACK UP AGAIN I HAVE THE EXACT DATE I THINK. WHEN HE IS WORKING ON THAT. SEARCHERS ASKING A TO DO A PLAN A TIMELINE. AND WE WILL WILL GO AND HOW COME. IS TO CONSTRUCTION OF WHAT ARE. THE NEXT STEPS ON ON CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE SYSTEM IN FISCAL REFORM YEAH. I MEAN I THINK I THINK THE THINGS WE HAVE THE RATE STUDY AND I KNOW IT'S LIKE I ASSUME THAT. YOU KNOW IF WE'RE ALL SAYING THAT. THIS IS GOING ON FORM WE'RE GONNA GO FOR IT I MEAN I THERE'S OBVIOUSLY OTHER FEES INFORMATION AND WE'RE USING THIS TO. TO RE LOOK AT HOW WE'RE DOING THINGS AND HOW MUCH WE SHOULD BE FUNDING AND SO FORTH THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A PLANNED FOR SAYING AND REALIZING THAT YOU'LL DETAILS MAY NEED TO BE FILLED IN. BUT WE SHOULD HAVE A TIME LINE OF THE GOALS FOR WHEN WE HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS OR IF THE OTHER RESPONSES THAT. GREAT STUDY WE SPENT THREE YEARS ON WE CAN'T TO LATER THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANTED THAT WE NEED TO KNOW THAT TOO SO I THINK IT'S- BUT WE'RE SAYING THAT THIS IS. THE BASIS OF YOU KNOW THIS IS. THIS EFFORT IS GOING TO INFORM HOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE IN THE FUTURE AND THEN. SOME BUT WE HAVE SET A GOAL FOR SAYING WELL THIS IS WHEN WE EXPECT. YOU KNOW WILL WORK WITH PEOPLE TO TRY TO ACHIEVE. YEAH SOME FIRST OF THE STRAITS. FUND BILL FIVE THAT WORD THAT'S WERE GONNA TRY TO. THAT MAKES SENSE. THE AND I DO WANT TO MAKE NOTE THAT THE RATE STUDY HAS INFORMED MANY DECISIONS. AND SO IT HAS IT IT REALLY HAS BEEN FOUNDATIONAL AND KIND OF EIGHT MANY OF THE DECISIONS HAVE BEEN ANCHORED INTO INFORMATION THAT IS. GATHERED THROUGH THE RIGHT STUDY. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE- SUPPLEMENTAL RATE ADJUSTMENTS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ADDITIONAL SERVICES AND THAT AND ALIGNED WITH- THE PRIORITIES OF MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING KIND OF THOSE REALLY KEY PRIORITIES WITHIN- THE SYSTEM IN ADMINISTRATION- AND THEN. REALLY LOOKING OUT AGAIN THAT THE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM AND TYING THOSE VALUES AND THOSE PAYMENTS BECAUSE IT IS TIED TO THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES AS WELL. YOU KNOW SO JUST WANTING TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S- A RECOGNITION THAT- THAT THE RATE STUDY IN INFORMATION THROUGH THAT PROCESS HASN'T BEEN SHELLED. IT REALLY HAS BEEN- A PART OF OUR DISCUSSIONS IN MAKING DECISIONS TO- SOME OF THE IMPORTANT STEPS THAT WE HAVE PROPOSED TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS WELL. ALL RIGHT. ACTUALLY IT MAY QUESTION FOR FINANCE- SO. WE REALIZED. IS A YEAR BY YEAR SAYING BUT ALSO AND WHEN THE GOVERNOR TALKS DOES BUDGET TALKS ABOUT OUT YEARS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE BUDGET WE TALK ABUT HOW YEARS. SO GIVEN THE RIGHT STUDY GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW FISCAL YOU KNOW WHAT THE STUDY AT LEAST INDICATES THAT WHERE WE ARE- IN TERMS OF. WHAT THAT WHAT'S NEEDED TO PROPERLY FUN. WHAT IS THE WHAT SORT OF ASSUMPTIONS. IS FINANCE USED TO PROTECT THE OUT YEAR EXPENDITURES FOR- DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. IS THE ARE YOU TALKING SO WHEN THE GOVERNOR SAYS OKAY WE HAVE THIS OUT YOU'RE GOING OUT. WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WE ASSUMING AND LOOKING AT THE OUT YEARS WHEN IT COMES TO- THIS PARTICULAR. SAID DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WOULD. NOTE THAT- IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THAT THE FOR THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATE INCREASES INCLUDING THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT AS WELL AS WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING A TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE DELAY THE SUSPENSION BY EIGHTEEN MONTHS SO YOU'LL SEE THAT- FOR ALL OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATE INCREASES IN ADDITION TO WHAT'S INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE PLAN TO SPEND ON JUNE. THIRTIETH OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND WE'LL REVISIT THAT IN MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO DEPENDING ON WHAT THE REVENUE SITUATIONS LOOKING LIKE. AT THAT TIME. HI SO THAT'S THE PLAN FOR THESE PARTICULAR- FUNDING THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED THAT SAID BEEN INFORMED BY THE RATE STUDY. OKAY SO JUST TO CLARIFY AND WILL WE WON'T HAVE THE DEBATE ABOUT THE EXPIRATION RIGHT NOW. I WILL HAVE THAT LATER. IN THE FUTURE HEARING- BUT- SO YOU KNOW AGAIN THE PRE SHOULD IF THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PUT AN. INCREASE FOR THIS COMING YEAR. G. THIS EXPLORATION FURTHER A- BEFORE THE EXPRESS READ JUST. THE RE PLANNING ANY FURTHER INCREASES IN THE OUT YEARS OR WE'RE JUST. BASICALLY SAYING WHAT WE HAVE AN INCREASE THIS COMING YEAR AND THEN FOR THE USER JUST STAYING THE SAME I MEAN I GUESS THAT'S THE QUESTION BEFORE THE EXPIRATION- JACOB FOR WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE FORECAST- THAT- FOR THE MULTI YEAR. DOES NOT REFLECT- ADDITIONAL INCREASES BEYOND WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN S. ENACTED THIS THIS CURRENT YEAR AND THEN THE ONES THAT WERE PROPOSING- THERE ARE INCREASES OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE OF- CONTINUED INCREASING CASELOAD YOU'D AND UTILIZATION- AND ALSO THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES. OKAY SO THERE'S AN ADJUSTMENT FOR MINIMUM WAGE CASELOAD CHANGES BUT NO OTHER OKAY. AT EIGHT SO I GUESS. WE HAVE A STUDY THAT. WE COMMISSION THE STATE THAT-SAYS WERE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION SHORT AT LEAST AS OF ROUGHLY TWENTY THREE L. TWENTY TWENTY OR SOMETHING- IS SO IS THERE BEEN DISCUSSION ON AND FINANCE- ABOUT TWELVE. WE MIGHT NEED TO CLOSE THAT UP A LITTLE BIT. SO I WOULD ONLY KNOW THAT THE I BELIEVE THEONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOESN'T REFLECT THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED ALREADY SO IT SHOULD BE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION THAT THE DELTA IS THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION MINUS THE FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN ANNUALIZED AMOUNT THAT WAS PROVIDED IN TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT. AS WELL AS THE THIRTY SIX MILLION THAT'S PROPOSED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OKAY SO NOW I GUESS WE'RE DOWN TO WHAT. ONE POINT SOMETHING BILLION. LIKE ONE POINT TWO. ONE POINT TWO OKAY I CAN. OUT OF THEM YEAH. EXACTLY THAT I THINK- YOU KNOW AS WE'VE- DIRECTOR RODRIGUEZ DISCUSSED- YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS SUPPORTIVE OF- EFFORT. TO KIND OF LOOK AT. YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE DO. IN THE SYSTEM TO MAKE THE SUSTAINABLE- YOU KNOW THE- YOU KNOW. WE NOT ONLY HAVE THE ISSUE OF THE- YOU KNOW THAT THEIR- RATE STUDY THAT. SHOWS THIS UNDER FUNDING BUT THERE'S ALSO THE ISSUE. OF THE CONTINUED GROWTH IN IN. YOU KNOW CASE LOADING UTILIZATION. SO WE REALLY ARE YOU KNOW I THINK WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF FINANCE- OF LOOKING AT. YOU KNOW HOW DO WE HOW DO WE KIND OF START WITH THOSE THE UNDERLYING. YOU KNOW STRUCTURE AND SCHOOL REFORMS. THAT WE CAN THEN YOU KNOW BUILD A VERY COST EFFECTIVE. YOU KNOW- SYSTEM. ON ON TOP OF SO. UNDERSTANDING THAT- YOU KNOW THERE'S SIGNIFICANT- INTEREST IN IN MOVING FORWARD SOMETHING AND I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATURE DID. COME TO AN AGREEMENT LAST YEAR OR YOU KNOW FOR THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- AND I'M SURE THOSE DISCUSSIONS WILL CONTINUE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. OKAY WELL I THINK THAT- INSTANCES AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING- I GUESS- WE'RE NOT. JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS COMING YEARS BUDGET BUT- AS YOU. HEARD MY CONVERSATION WITH DIRECTOR MARGIN AND JOB I MEAN I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WHERE WERE WE GOING TO WRITE SO. AGAIN APPRECIATE. THE TO GO DOUBTS THE GOVERNOR LAST YEAR DOING THE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S. FOR THE YEAR BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT WERE WE GOING. FOR THE YEARS OUT- AND WE CAN EVEN WE WILL TALK ABOUT THIS YEAR BUT WE'LL TALK ABOUT FUTURE HEARING- BUT IT WAS WORTH THINKING. THINKING ABOUT. HIM LET'S TRY IF LET'S THINK ABOUT PLAN FOR WERE WE GOING TO. END UP RATE- WHAT WHAT'S OUR GOAL AND MY GUESS IS THAT ISN'T JUST. THE INCREASE THIS YEAR AND THEN STAY STILL RIGHT I MEAN WE HAVE ON GOING WORK TO DO- TO DO THAT AND- I THINK THE RATE STUDY WHETHER WE FULLY AGREE WITH ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE NOT. AND THEY'RE PO CERTAINLY AND I APPRECIATE THE PART IS GOING TO WORK- IN STAKEHOLDERS TO WORK ON IT WILL TRY TO FIND MORE COST EFFECTIVE WAYS OF DOING THINGS- BUT I DON'T SEE US BEING ABLE TO SQUEEZE OUT ANOTHER ONE POINT TWO BILLION THAT WAY. AND SO THERE'S THAT AND SO I HOPE THAT AS WE'RE LOOKING GOING OUT- THAT. WE THINK ABOUT HOW CAN WE- IN A MORE REALISTIC WAY PLAN FOR WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING- GOING OUT. TO BE SURE WE MEET THE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE I MEAN THERE'S NO WE'VE WE'VE ESTABLISHED CHAIRED THE LANTERN MAN ACT. RIGHT SO WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION THAT WE REALLY HAVE AN LAW. AND SO HOW WE CAN MEET THAT OBLIGATION ANY KNOW THAT ALL OF US ARE COMMITTED TO DO THAT SO- SO. I KNOW WE'RE NOT GONNA DO IT ALL IN ONE YEAR- IT BE GREAT IF WE COULD- BUT- LET'S. YEAH WE HAVE SPENT THE EFFORT ON THE STUDY LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW WE TAKE IT AND THEN HOW WE THE OUTLOOK. IN LESS WE COME BACK AND SAY OH YOU KNOW WHAT WE DON'T LIKE IT WE DON'T AGREE WITH THAT WHATEVER BUT THAT'S NOT WHY HEARING THEN. IF THAT'S SO AND IT'S AND APPRECIATE THAT'S INFORMING DECISIONS ARE READY. YOU KNOW HOW HOW DO WE GET TO WHERE WE WANT TO GO- WITH THIS OUT AND SEND IT TO AND SET A TIME LINE. FOR TRYING TO DO THAT. WE ALL AGREEMENT ON THAT. I SEE SOME NODS WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE DISCUSSIONS IN TURN OKAY WELL AT THE I HOPE CONCEPTUALLY RIGHT WE ALWAYS ASK ABOUT THE TIME WHEN WILL BE IT CETERA AND I GET IT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO I HAVE TO PUT ON THE BUDGET TO YOU KNOW WE'RE ON IT TOGETHER SO YOU KNOW WE HAD A AND THERE'S VARIOUS ECONOMIC VAGARIES AND YEAH I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF- WILL- OF BOTH THE PREVIOUS GOVERNOR IN THIS GOVERNOR'S DESIRE TO. BE FISCALLY PRUDENT AND PREPARE FOR ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS AND SO FORTH SO NOT SAYING A WE JUST SO RIGHT GOT IT BUT LET'S BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS AND GOT FIGURE OUT LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT. WE CAN AGREE ON THAT. YES NODS AS WE LOOK I'M LOOKING AT FINANCE NEARLY THAT YOU IF YOU THAT I APPRECIATE YOU ANSWERING SERIOUS MIKE. YEAH I JUST I WANT TO JUST SAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE WITH OUR SYSTEM IN FISCAL REFORM DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR WORK GROUP AND THOSE ARE OUR CONVERSATIONS THAT THAT ARE AND I KNOW. IT EITHER QUESTIONS ARE ARE OUTSIDE OF WHAT I AM I AM I AM SAYING BUT THE WORK THAT OUR OUR GROUP HAS BEEN DOING IT'S JUST BEN REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND WE DO NEED TO START TAKING A LOOK AT THAT OUTCOMES AND- AND REALLY HOW WE'RE GOING TO MEASURE WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO MEASURE THAT IS. IS REALLY CRITICAL TO MEANINGFUL LIFE- AND IT IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION THAT WE NEED TO HAVE YEAH. OKAY SO I KNOW I KNOW IT'S MORE THAN JUST THE MONEY PART BUT THE MONEY IS IMPORTANT BUT OUT RESOURCES PEOPLE CAN'T DO THEIR WORK- SO I THINK THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER QUESTIONS AND I KNOW THAT IT FEET EARLIER ASKED ONE AND WE SAID WE'RE HOLD OFF. IN TERMS OF VALUE BASED AND THEN I. POLICY INITIATIVES SUCH AS EMPLOYMENT. SELF DETERMINATION CONCERN RIGHT MISS OF THE IF YOU WANT TO DRESS THOSE. QUESTIONS NOW. THANK YOU- SO VERY SPECIFICALLY TO THE QUESTION ON- ITEMS- NUMBER THREE THAT YOU HAVE. ON PAGE NINE. SO TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT POLICY- ITEMS THAT WERE WERE CONSIDERED AND THE RATE MODELS IN THE RATE STUDY- EMPLOYMENT FIRST. SO WHEN YOU'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT KIND OF THE POLICY SO. INCLUSIVE EMPLOYMENT- EMPLOYMENT FIRST- COMPLIES WITH H. CBS FEDERAL RULE. LOOKING AT THOSE MECHANISMS AND MISTER CLAUS HE HAD IDENTIFIED A COUPLE OF THOSE EXAMPLES- EARLIER- AS FAR AS TAKING A LOOK AT THAT COMMUNITY. ASPECT OF THE DAY SERVICES TAKING A LOOK AT HOW TO- APPROACH SOME OF THE SERVICES WITHIN. AND THE RIGHT MODEL SO THOSE THINGS WERE CERTAINLY CONSIDERED. THE OTHER IS TAKING A LOOK AT REGIONAL DIFFERENCES AS FAR AS MAKING. I'M SURE AS WE CONTINUE TO KEEP IN THE FOREFRONT OF OUR DISCUSSIONS AND EVERYTHING AS FAR AS EQUITY AND ACCESS TO SERVICES. YOU KNOW SO BI LINGUAL PAY WAS CONSIDERED SO THOSE WERE SOME ELEMENTS. WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT SELF DETERMINATION. THAT PIECE THAT'S A SEPARATE SEPARATE PROGRAM I'M- SO AS FAR AS- MEANT THAT ARE PART. OF SELF DETERMINATION. SELF TERMINATION THAT IS PART OF IT THIS PERSON CENTERED PLANNING. THOUGH WHILE STILL DETERMINE. ONE A PART OF THE- POLICY WITHIN THE SELF. THAT RIGHT MODELS. PERSON CENTERED PLANNING AND THAT FOCUS CERTAINLY WAS. SO ANY QUESTIONS RE THE- AND THEN I BY THE THAT WE- HAD ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE NEXT STEPS- REGARDING THESE- SYSTEM AND FISCAL REFORM WORK GROUP- AND THE CONSIDERATIONS WITHIN ON THE ITEMS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED AS FAR AS THE DIFFERENT POLICIES- THE CONSIDERATIONS- AS FAR AS STATUTES AND REGULATIONS THAT THOSE THINGS WOULD HAVE TO HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS THAT IDENTIFIED SHOULD THERE BE- FURTHER ADVANCEMENT- AND THEN TAKING A LOOK AT- THE UPDATE ON THE GOALS AND THE PROGRESS OF THE SYSTEM AND I'M FISCAL REFORM WORKGROUP. AS I'D SAID WHILE THE FORMAL WORKGROUP BUT THE DS TASK FORCE WAS IN JANUARY- THERE WERE A NUMBEROF DIFFERENT MEETINGS AND DISCUSSIONS THAT IT OCCURRED I THINK WE HAVE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN AND FIFTEEN DIFFERENT MEETINGS THAT WERE VERY FOCUSED ON ELEMENTS THAT TOUCH SYSTEM AND FISCAL REFORM- SINCE THE SUMMER- AND RECONSTITUTING THE DS TASK FORCE FOR THAT FUTURE WORKING FOUNDATIONAL WORK WAS REALLY IMPORTANT AND MORE WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO IT WE HAVE LIKE A HUNDRED FIFTY SIX DIFFERENT PARTICIPANTS. BETWEEN THE DS TASK FORCE IN FIVE DIFFERENT WORK GROUPS. AND YOU MAY IN TERMS WRAPS KNEEING STATURE. CHANGE FOR. EMPLOYMENT SO JUST AS ANY TIME WE HAVE DIFFERENT POLICY CHANGES WE ALWAYS HAVE TO EVALUATE WATER- WHAT WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO WITH OUR THIRTY. AND SO THERE'S DIFFERENT TIMES AND YOU HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT STATUTES. REGULATIONS NO SO JUST LOOKING AT THE STRUCTURE OF IT ALSO DO YOU ANTICIPATE. ANY OF THESE CHANGES BEING INCORPORATED INTO BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE THIS YEAR OR- TO THAT SIDE TO DISSIPATE WHAT WE GOING TO BE ASKED. TO LOOK AT- SURE SO IT'S A PROBLEM WE'LL HAVE TO- FOR THE THREE DIFFERENT- SERVICE CODES SO THAT WILL REQUIRE A WAIVER AMENDMENT SO WE WOULD HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THOSE THREE SERVICE CODES. AND ALSO THE PERFORMANCES- INCENTIVE PLAN THAT WE WOULD BE I'M HAVING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE RELATED TO THAT BECAUSE WE DO HAVE CURRENT. AUTHORITY IN THE STATUTE FOR PERFORMANCE CONTRACTING- BUT THIS WOULD FURTHER DEFINING KIND OF THOSE NEXT STEPS. AND IN TERMS OF. TIMELINE FOR MY STAFF TO LOOK AT THESE SOME OF HIS PROPOSED TRAILER BILL- LANGUAGE DOING TO SPEAK GETTING THAT AND THE NEXT I KNOW WE HAVE TIME LINES AND BEING ABLE TO MOVE THOSE FOR IT I JUST DON'T HAVE THAT HANDY WITH ME RIGHT NOW BUT WE'LL MAKE SURE WE- COMMUNICATE. TO THE PRESS AT THAT THE PLAN IS TO GET THOSE. POSTED PUBLICLY ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WEBSITE- ON FEBRUARY FIRST OKAY THANK YOU SO WE APPRECIATE HAVING IT BEFORE WE ACTUALLY HAVE HER HEARING ON THE- THE- THE PART OVER. VIEW HERE YEAH ON THE DEPARTMENT OKAY. AND THEN I GUESS- NO QUESTION AND THIS MAY ALSO- FOR- MISTER PULASKI- SO WE HEARD FROM- WEBER STAKEHOLDERS TO INVOLVED AND- EARLY INTERVENTION AND- SHE RAISED SEVERAL CONCERNS- ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AGENCIES INDIVIDUALS AND SURVEY MAYBE NOT FOR ACTUALLY REFLECTING THE OVERHEAD AND TRAVEL COSTS IT'S ADDRESS SO. IT CAN YOU PERHAPS ADDRESS. SOME OF HER REMARKS IN TERMS OF- HOW HOW UNITED DRESSES OR HOW YOU. HOW YOU GOING TO OUR HAVE ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND. WE DID TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE COMMENTS LARGELY THROUGH THE RECASTING THE RATE MODEL SO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL WE DO NOT HAVE RATE MODELS FROM ANY OF THOSE SERVICES BACK IN MARCH BECAUSE OF THE PLANT A TIE THEM TO MEDICARE RATES AND WE- HEARING PUBLIC COMMENT DECIDED TO GO. AND BUILD RATE MODELS AS WE DID WITH THE- OTHER SERVICES INCLUDE WITHIN OUR SCOPE OF WORK. TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP- AS WAS MENTIONED THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT FOLKS ARE DOING ABOUT TWENTY THREE BILLABLE HOURS OF SERVICE. ON A WEEKLY BASIS THAT WAS DRIVEN MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE BY INFORMATION FROM THE PROVIDER SERVE ACT. NOW I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE SERVER WAS COMPLICATED MY CERTAINLY WOULD NOT DENY THAT- AND- WE DID HOWEVER TAKE CARE TO BE AS CLEAR AS WE COULD BE IN THE INSTRUCTIONS IN TERMS WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE THE ISSUE THAT WAS BROUGHT UP WAS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SCHEDULED HOURS. VERSUS PROVIDED HOURS WE WERE PRETTY CLEAR THE INSTRUCTIONS THAT WERE LOOKING FOR THE NUMBER OF HOURS OF DRY CAT WERE PROVIDED. NOT SCHEDULED WE HAD A SEPARATE AREA WE'RE ASKING FOR WHAT THE TYPICAL. A NUMBER OF UNDELIVEREDHOURS WERE SO WE HAD A DIFFERENT LINE REPORT THOSE. THOSE MISSED APPOINTMENT SO TO SPEAK. AND SO WHAT WE SAW TO THE PROVIDER SURVEY WAS PEOPLE REPORTING- I'LL BE ABLE TO DELIVER BETWEEN TWENTY SEVEN AND THIRTY HOURS OF DOUBLE ACTIVELY PER WEEK WE THOUGHT THAT WAS TOO AGGRESSIVE SO. CERTAINLY OUR ASSUMPTIONS ARE LESS THAN IT WAS. TO THE PROVIDER SERVE AT. I DON'T THINK I WAS DRIVEN BY THE- BETWEEN AGENCY. IN IN THE PROVIDERS BECAUSE WE DID THE SURVEY ANALYSIS AND WE START IN THE WEEDS ABOUT HOW DOES WE APPROACH THAT BUT- WE'LL- CALCULATE BOTH WEIGHTED AVERAGES WAITED BY THE SIZE THE PROVIDER AND MEDIANS. HANDS THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE IS NOT GONNA BE IMPACTED VERY MUCH BY INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS BECAUSE BY DEFINITION ARE NOT DELIVERING AS MUCH SERVICES AS AGENCY PROVIDERS ARE SO. OUR ASSUMPTION AS RELATES TO BILLABLE HOURS IS LESS THAN THE PROVIDER SURVEY CALCULATED BOTH AS A WEIGHTED AVERAGE AS WELL AS A MEDIA. THE ISSUE OF ADMINISTRATIVE. RATES A SOMETHING THAT EXTENDS FAR BEYOND THE INPUT ABOUT THE PROGRAM AND CERTAINLY NOT SOMETHING THAT WE DID GET FEEDBACK ON AS PART OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT PROCESS IN FACT I THINK I PROBABLY TALKED ABOUT THAT. BACK IN MARCH SO THE APPROACH THAT WE TOOK TO ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WAS TO ATTEMPT TO TARGET. THAT PARTICULAR COMPONENT THE RIGHT MODEL TO CURRENT EXPENSES THAT PROVIDERS ARE INCURRING. SO THE AGAIN WE GO INTO SOME DETAIL ABOUT THE RACE CITY REPORT AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC COMMENTS BUT THE PROVIDER SURVEY TOLD US THAT PROVIDERS WERE. OPERATING AND ADMINISTRATIVE RATES UP ABOUT SEVENTEEN PERCENT. HOWEVER WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING TO INCREASE THE RATES BY ABOUT THAT 12% IS GOING TO APPLY TO A MUCH LARGER BASE OF SPENDING. IT GENERATES THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY. AS THE 17% DOES ON THE LOWER BASE OF SPENDING SO THE IDEA WAS WE DON'T WANT TO ADD ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS BUT EFFECTIVELY TO MAINTAIN PARITY. IN TERMS WERE ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ARE OUT NOW AS THE RATE MODELS. BUT I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT THAT ASSUMPTION MEANS THAT WE OF INCREASE THE RATES. THAT WOULD NOT THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE YET SO I'VE- WHAT YOU SAY BUT YEAH. STE CERTAINLY MISTER CHAIR BACK THE I MEAN THE WHOLE PREMISE IF THE RATES WERE IMPLEMENTED AND- RIGHT BEN BEN AS A PERCENTAGE OF THAT LARGER BASE THEN YOU'D GET BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF HIS MERE MINUTES I WAS OF THE 12% AS A CAP ON WHAT PROVIDERS CAN DELIVER THEY DON'T HAVE TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE AT THE 70% THROUGHOUT TODAY IF THE RATES. REMAIN UNCHANGED. WHICH AS MR HOUSE REPORT ABOUT THE NOT ON CHANGE RIGHT THERE'S BEEN A FOR THE MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE- LIVE WITH THE LAST POINT I WANTED TO MAKE THOUGH IS AS THE IF THE RATE MODELS RECOMMENDED IN THE FUTURE YEAR AND THEY CONTINUE BE UPDATED AS WE WOULD SUGGEST ACCOUNT FOR INCREASING RISE IN THE COST THAT. 12% WILL CONTINUE TO APPLY TO A LARGER LARGER BEARS AND GENERATE MORE ADMINISTRATIVE DOLLARS OVER THE LONG TERM SO I THINK THOSE ARE THE TWO PRIMARY CRITICISMS THAT I HEARD DURING THE EARLY REMARKS. OKAY AND THEN I GUESS THE TERM. OF WORK FOR SELF HEARD NOW. THIS YEAR BUT- PRIOR HERE. ABOUT THE CHALLENGE OF THE LARGE RATES OF TURNOVER AND SO FORTH. IS AT THEIR DISCUSSIONS ABOUT. NOT JUST IN TERMS OF BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE'RE- THE RATE STUDY LOOKING AT BUT ALSO LOOKING FORWARD AND MEANS THAT. WE TALK ABOUT QUALITY MEASURES AND SO FORTH I MEAN IT'S A SERVER PROCESS MEASURED TO. AND I KNOW THE THAT'S ALSO IN CHILD CARE AND SOME OTHER FIELDS WHERE. THERE WERE WE'VE MAKING SOME EFFORTS TO MONITOR. THE RATE OF TURNOVER BECAUSE- YOUNG WHEN YOU JUST A DISTRICT A PROVIDER TURN OVER DEBTS. IN RELATIONSHIPS THEY'RE HAVING TO BE RENEWED OR CHANGED AND SO FORTH AND THERE'S- THERE'S A COST TO THAT TO BOTH PHYSICALLY AND ALSO- FOR THE QUALITY S WELL SO. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THE DEPARTMENTS. LOOKING INTO MONITOR. OF THE THOSE ARE NOW ARE PAYMENTS ALLOW YOU KNOW CAUSING HIGH RATES OF. NO TURN OVER TO WAYS WE CAN REDUCE TURNOVER. YEAH THANK THE- HAVING THE GRANULAR DETAIL THIS THAT TURNER IT AS STATE LAW IS TO STATE IT'S NOT IT VISIBILITY THAT WE HAVE HOWEVER YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD THE CONCERNS WE FOR THE CONCERNS FROM THE- COMMUNITY BOTH THE- PROVIDERS AND FAMILIES SO WE ARE EXPLORING THERE'S DIFFERENT MECHANISMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO REALLY DO- REVEALING ASSESSMENTS ARE WORKS POINT WHAT THOSE OPTIONS ARE WHERE THERE'S A NATIONAL CORE INDICATORS ARE WAYS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT STAFF STABILITY AND- AND WHILE WE HAVEN'T- ESTABLISHED A MECHANISM- AS OF NOW WE ARE AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND EXPLORING HOW WE CAN. GET IT JUST ON VISIBILITY INTO INTO IT OTHER THAN JUST ANECDOTAL DISCUSSIONS WITH THE COMMUNITY BY THAT TIME THEY'LL BE THAT MAYBE THERE COULD BE SOME MECHANISM TO BE DEVELOPED THAT IS YOU'RE LOOKING AT HOW DO WE KNOW MYRA QUALITY AND SERVICE AND SO FORTH AND IF YOU DO EVENTUALLY GO TO VALUE BASED- PROCESS OF. THAT NO QUALITY DATA COLLECTION THINK CERTAINLY ONE OF THE ITEMS TO LOOK AT IS- PERFORCE TURNOVER RATE AND- IT IS SAID THERE'S A TREMENDOUS COST TO TURNOVERS SO AND SO WILL THEIR DATA COSTS SHOULD THEN BE REINVESTED TO WORK FOR STABILITY INSTEAD OF SPENDING IT ON CONSTANTLY. BOWL AND THE IN IN PLANTS TO NEED TO GET IN TOUCH ANOTHER PROVIDER WHAT THEIR SAID IS BECAUSE THAT PERSON'S CHANGED EIGHT YEN ELF THE THINKING ABOUT WHAT WITH- SOME OF THE THINGS WE CAN PUT INTO PLACE. TO MONITOR THAT. AND GET THAT KIND OF.

WELCOME THANK YOU MARTY MOTOR FAMILY MEMBER ALSO BUT CITY CAN CALIFORNIA DISABILITY YOU'RE CLEANING ACTION NETWORK THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS HEARING. ALSO THANKS TO THE APARTMENT. ON THEIR WORKS AND BRING STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER AND- LOOKING AT SYSTEM REFORM. TWO IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE THINK SHOULD BE DONE BY THE SUBCOMMITTEE OR WORKING WITH THE STATE. IS TO. MAKE RETROACTIVE- TO THE THREE SERVICE BECAUSE THAT WERE LEFT OUT OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATE INCREASES. THAT WENT INTO EFFECT THIS YEAR THAT WON'T GO INTO EFFECT FOR THOSE THREE UNTIL NEXT YEAR- TWO OF THEM DEAL WITH THE EARLY START- WHICH IS A BIG. PARTY FOR THE STATE- AND IT IN THIS. THIRD DEALS WITH THE- INDEPENDENT LIVING THE STATE HAS DONE RETROACTIVE PAYMENTS BEFORE YOU MEDI CAL IN OTHER WAYS AND SO. I THINK THE STATE. SHOULD CONSIDER THAT THE OTHER. IS AGAIN- WITH THE WORK GROUPS UNDER THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TASK FORCE DOES MEETING. AND THE INFORMATION SHOULD BE MADE PUBLIC AND IT SHOULD THE MEETING SHOULD BE POSTED PUBLICLY. I THINK THAT WAS JUST AN OVERSIGHT BY THE DEPARTMENT DEPARTMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN VERY TRANSPARENT. BUT AND THEY DON'T NEED TO- THOSE MEETINGS AT THE PUBLIC COMMENT BUT EVERY OTHER DEPARTMENT THAT I WORK. IN A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS ON MEDI CAL. MASTER PLAN ON EATING ALL THOSE WE ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. SUPPORT ISSUE OF TIME LINE AND BY THE WAY CAN'T AND- STEPS. INTO OUT. PARTS OF THE OF THE RATE STUDY WE THINK THERE'S A WAY TO DO THAT AND LASTLY- WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE ISSUE POLICY. DOES IT ME MAKES SENSE TO HAVE SERVICE CODES OR EVEN THE RATE MODELS SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WELCOME THANK YOU DOCTOR PAIRING CARRUTHERS WITH THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTIONS TODAY AND THANK THE DEPARTMENT FOR THAT. TESTIMONY TODAY BECAUSE IT CENTERED ON THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT PIECES IN THIS CONVERSATION ONE IS STABILIZING THE SYSTEM INTO IS. IMPROVING THE SYSTEM MOVING A SYSTEM FOR YOUR QUESTIONS AROUND VALUES BASED I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT WAS THE COUNCIL'S RESPONSE WE SAW THE DOLLAR SIGN. OF ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION SOUNDS LIKE A BIG NUMBER HOW DO WE KNOW PEOPLE'S LIVES WILL BE IMPROVED- WITH THAT LEGISLATURE'S. INVESTMENT AND THAT'S WHY THE COUNCIL CONTRACTED FOR THE STUDY THAT THE WITNESS MR HAVE TALKED ABOUT. AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT THOSE OUTCOMES ARE. ADDITIONALLY WE APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT AND MISTER PULASKI REGARDING SUPPORTING SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT RELATIONSHIP IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IN PEOPLE'S LIVES TO MAKE SURE SOMEONE THEY KNOW. AND TRUST AND CAN RELY ON. INVESTING IN TIERED LEVELS OF TRAINING SO YOU LEARN MORE YOU GET PAID MORE AS A WAY TO KEEP A PROFESSION AS THE WORK FORCE. ADDITIONALLY WE'RE LOOKING FOR. SERVICES THAT INCREASE INVOLVEMENT IN COMMUNITY LIVING A MISTER PULASKI TALKED ABOUT HOW THE RATE MODEL INCENTIVIZE IS SERVICES AND COMMUNITY BASED SETTINGS WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WELCOME MONEY DR GRANT A VERY JUTTING CAL DISA SERVE A SAYS I'D LIKE TO ASK MISTER LYNCH COMMENTS ABOUT OUR GRAY FOR BOTH THIS HEARING AND ALSO FOR THE INCREDIBLE EFFORTS OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE LAST YEAR AND REALLY MOVING US FOURTEEN GETTING US THAT DOWN PAYMENT ON WHAT WE NEEDED- TO BUILD A FOR THE RATE STUDY SO YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT THE- INCREASE IN PURCHASES SERVICE GROWTH IN THE SYSTEM THAT'S ASOLUTELY TRUE A QUARTER OF THAT COMING UP IN THE COMING YEAR IS THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATE INCREASES A THIRD OF IT OR SO IS ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE. AND THE OTHER PART OF IT IS ABOUT A PURCHASE SERVICE SO IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT RATE REFORM OTHER THAN THAT'S THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATE INCREASES AND SO WE'VE GOT A SHORTFALL STILL OF ABOUT ONE POINT FOR A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN THAT UNDER THE RATE STUDY AND YOU KNOW THE KNOCK ON EFFECTS OF THAT ARE PRETTY PREDICTABLE WE SELL A PROGRAM CLOSURES WILL LISTS- PEOPLE NOT GETTING IT SAYS TO THE SERIES THIS IS WE HAVE ROLLED OVER THAT IS OVERWORKED UNDER APPRECIATED WITH INCREDIBLE TURN OVER AND THEN IT LEAD TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN THEM SO WE THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SYSTEMS CHANGE MOVING FORWARD AND ARE HAPPY TO BE PART OF THAT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME I CAN'T DO ENOUGH REAL FOCUSING ON THE TIME LINE AND THESE AND AN REALLY GET US A WILL WE HAVE THE BILL BECAUSE I IT'S AN WILL MATTER OF COURSE AS AS A DOES. LIZA WE DON'T IT WAS A WORK FOR WHEN I. LEFT HIM. THANK YOU. WELCOME MORNING FOR THE ARE ON DOCTOR DUBS WAYNE WHEN THE FORMER OF THE SPEECH ON HEARING IS. I'VE BEEN AND IN OUR FOR OVER THIRTY FIVE YEARS I HAVE TO CONCERN WITH REGARD TO RATE ADJUSTMENTS THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT FOR SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGISTS AND CALIFORNIA'S A MASTER'S DEGREE THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN THOUSAND A SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGIST IN CALIFORNIA ROUGHLY A THIRD PART IN SERVICES EARLY INTERVENTION. WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH- WAIT LISTS BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET IN A SPEECH PATHOLOGIST BECAUSE WE CAN'T PAY THEM ENOUGH AS AN EARLY INTERVENTION PROVIDER. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EARLY START WE HAVE A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FROM TOO MUCH TWO YEARS TO THREE YEARS AND THE CLICK CLOCK STARTS TICKING WE NEED TO GET THEM SEEN. BECAUSE THE SCHOOLS CAN'T ACCOMMODATE THEM SO I'D ASK IN THE PROCESS OF EXAMINING WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH REGARD TO RATE IN REIMBURSEMENT THAT WE CONSIDER THE QUALITY OF STAFF THAT WE USE THEY'RE HIGHLY EDUCATED AND EACH YEAR THEY REQUIRE TWELVE. HOURS OF CONTINUING AD BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IS ACCESS THE SERVICE BECAUSE ONCE A WEEK MIGHT WE CLOSE THAT WINDOW THEY DON'T GET EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES. THANK YOU THANK YOU. WELCOME WE'LL SEVERED ESSIEN CS- TWO THINGS WERE LIKE REALLY COMMEND YOU FOR YOUR CALL FOR ACTION I'M HOPING FOR CONCRETE ACTION CONVERSATIONS ARE GREAT. WE CAN HAVE THEM FOR YEARS WE NEED ACTIONS THAT ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO INCREASE ACCESS AND AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES OR FOLKS. YOUR COMMENTS ON THE DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONALS RIGHT NOW THE SYSTEM IS BASED ON BASED ON ALL A SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN MINIMUM WAGE SYSTEM THAT'S OUR INCREASES THAT YOU REFERRED TO IN THE BUDGET ARE. WE NEED MORE THAN THAT IF YOU WANT QUALITY SERVICES YOU REALLY HAVE TO MAKE A PUSH ON THAT. I WOULD ARGUE THAT PART OF THE REASON THE DOLLAR AMOUNT SAY THE SAME IS RIGHT NOW WE HAVE LESS ACCESS PEOPLE ARE WAITING. THEREFORE THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE SERVICES THE DOLLARS TO INCREASE THE RATE THE EXPECTED. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE TO FILL THOSE JOBS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE A LOOK AT IT FIND A WAY TO REALLY STABILIZE INCREASE ARE JUST. REX ARE FOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

EYESIGHT OF A GOAL THAT WE CAN HIT AS FAR AS IMPLEMENTING BETTER RATE MODELS TRANSPARENT RATE MODELS SO THAT'S A HUGE SUCCESS THE DAUNTING TROUT TASK NOW SEEMS TO BE SHIFTING TOWARDS RATE REFORM AND VALUE BASED PURCHASING AND I WOULD WANT TO SAY WE WELCOME THAT CHALLENGE WE'RE SUPPORT OF THAT WE WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT CHALLENGE- WE THINK IT'S DOABLE IT'S NECESSARY BUT WE COUPLE THINGS ONE WE NEED TO FINISH WHAT WE STARTED WE ARE REALLY ON THE CUSP OF BEING ABLE TO MAKE MEANINGFUL REFORMS IN THE SYSTEM WITH PROVIDER RATE THAT WILL DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR WORKFORCE. BUT WE SHOULD TAKE THOSE STEPS THAT WE CAN TAKE NOW INTO THAT INVOLVES A TIME LINE OF PLAN- OTHER SAID THERE ARE EASY- WAYS THAT WE CAN REPORT ON THE MOVE FOR ONCE OUR CRUISE TO TEXEL OF CODES TOGETHER.

IN MY DUAL ROLES THAT'S ESPECIALLY CLEAR TO ME AB I THINK A STOP GAP MEASURE IS A WONDERFUL THING AND WHAT WE'VE GOT SO FAR IS A WONDERFUL THING AS SUCH BUT IT NEEDS TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR WHAT IT IS BY DEFINITION IT'S A TEMPORARY STOPGAP FIX. AND IN THE MEANTIME WHAT I'M SEEING IS YET THE GAP IS CONTINUING TO WIDEN WE'VE GOT THESE GREAT IDEAS H. CBS PERSON CENTERED THINKING INCREASED MEANING FULL COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT BUT WELL WE'VE GOT THE IDEAS GOING EVERY DAY WHAT I SEE IN REALITY IS THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. A NUMBER GET LEFT BEHIND EVERY DAY BECAUSE WE CANNOT RETAIN THE STAFF TO SAFELY TAKE THEM OUT IN THE COMMUNITY THANK YOU THANK YOU. WELCOME TO. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS ERIC HARRISON WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AND THERE ARE THREE MAIN POINTS THAT DEAR SEE SUPPORTS REGARDING RATES FIRST WE SUPPORT THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATE INCREASE FOR EARLY START SPECIALIZATION THERAPEUTIC SERVICES INFANT DEVELOPMENT AND INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES CONSISTENT WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATES INCREASE INCLUDED IN THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BUDGET OUR SECOND WE SUPPORT THE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM BASED ON THE REGIONAL CENTER PERFORMANCE CONTRACT AND FRANKLY WITH THE INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP RATE REVISED MODEL INCLUDING NON. ENGLISH RATES. YOUR WORK OVER THE PAST YEAR AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR- THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED WORK ON THIS TOPIC. THANK YOU. AS. SENATOR PAN MY NAME'S ERIC STERN I HAVE BEEN WORKING AS A SERVICE COORDINATOR TO REGIONAL CENTER OF THESE PAY FOR THE LAST NINETEEN YEARS IT'S VERY COMMON FOR VENDORS TO TELL ME THEY WILL PROVIDE SERVICES WHEN THEY CAN STAFF UP IN OUR AREA I BELIEVE IT'S CLOSE 250% IN THE EAST BAY OF- ANNUAL TURNOVER OF DRUG SUPPORT STAFF. THE TRICK SUPPORTS HAVE CRUCIALLY NEED TO BE HONORED AND RESPECTED FOR THE CRUCIAL WORK THEY TO. AS CHAIR OF THE ACLU CALIFORNIA DD COUNCIL REPRESENTING THOUSANDS OF A DIRECT SUPPORT OF REGIONAL CENTER WORKERS WERE FULLY INTO LINE WITH THE LETTERMAN COALITIONS. THREE YEAR REINVESTMENT PROPOSAL NOT JUST A STOP GAP MEASURE BUT TO FULLY FUND THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DEFICIT- AND INCLUDING. AB THIS FUNDING FOR I ALLOWS AND- EARLY START. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PUTTING ON THIS HEARING. THANK YOU BOB. WELCOME HI GOOD MORNING THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN- MY NAME'S TOM HINES SOME EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF NONPROFIT CALLED THE SPAN OF A SINCE WE PROVIDE SUPPORTED LIVING INDEPENDENT LIVING IN EMPLOYMENT SERVICES IN ALAMEDA COUNTY- WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT LAST YEAR FOR THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATE INCREASES REALLY APPRECIATE THE INCLUSION OF THE OTHER SERVICE CODES IN THIS YEAR'S- GOVERNORS BUT- MY AGENCY- IS IN. A HIGH COST AREA WE HAD 49% TURNOVER IN STAFF IN LAST YEAR WE CARRY ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY VACANCIES AT ANY GIVEN TIME. THE MINIMUM WAGE ISSUE IS A HUGE ISSUE FOR US. FOR SUPPORTED LEVINE THE LAW ALSO THE RATE- METHODOLOGY I'M CONCERNED ABOUT CONSUMERS WHO HAVE HIGH NUMBERS OF AYE HSS HOURS. AND LOW NUMBERS HAVE SUPPORTED LIVING HOURS FUNDED BY THE REGIONAL CENTER AND THOSE HOURS WON'T COVER COSTS WE HELP PEOPLE MANAGE THEIR I TO PASS A CORD BOB COM SITE. TO BE LOOKED AT THANK. THANK YOU. WELCOME THANK YOU SO MUCH OR HOLDING THIS HEARING DOCTOR PAN REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT- I AM WENDY FERGUSON I'M THE CEO OF COMMUNITY CATALYST OF CALIFORNIA WE SERVE- ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS ANNUALLY WE HAVE OVER THREE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES THROUGHOUT THE STATE- AND I WANT TO FIRST AND FOREMOST SAY THAT I COMPLETELY SUPORT THE LINEMEN COALITION PROPOSAL I HAVE FUNDING FINDING THE RIGHT MODEL AND THE DEFICIT OF ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION I ALSO AGREE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY WITH THE MINIMUM WAGE ISSUE HEALTH AND SAFETY WHICH IS NOT EFFECTIVE- I DO THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING IN PLACE TO INCREASE MINIMUM WAGE ACROSS THE BOARD- WITHOUT MANY HAVING TO EXPEND A LOT OF ADMIN. OF TIME TO TRY TO GET A COUPLE PENNIES TWENTY THIS COUPLE PENNIES ON OUR RATE FOR A FEW EMPLOYEES THE OTHER PART THAT I WANTED TO SPEAK TO TODAY IS THE- PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE THAT'S IN THE BUDGET. I AM CONCERNED THAT THAT'S CAN BE PUT ON THE BACKS OF PROVIDERS WHO ARE CURRENTLY UNDER FUNDED. BECAUSE IF THE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MEET PERFORMANCE CRITERIA TO SHOW THAT WE'RE PROVIDING QUALITY SERVICES IN ORDER FOR THE- DDS TO GIVE THEM MONEY. THAT MEANS SOMEBODY'S PAYING FOR THAT AND ENSURING THE SERVICES ARE OCCURRING IN ORDER TO GET IT. SO I JUST WANNA STATE THAT AS A CONCERN THANK YOU THANK YOU. WELCOME THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN OUT THAT PASSED OVER WITH IMAGINE SUPPORTED LIVING APTOS CALIFORNIA AND- IF WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A PURELY BECAUSE BASED FUNDING MODEL I APPRECIATE THE DYNAMIC TRANSPARENT- ONE THAT'S BEEN CREATED BUT I DO THINK THAT- QUALITY AS AND I APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING THIS UP AND ALSO ADDRESSING DISPARITIES IN OUR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES ARE JUST AS OUR CHEN MY HOPE THOSE WILL STAY TOP OF MIND ALSO WAS WE DECIDE.
