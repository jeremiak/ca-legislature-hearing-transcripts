WE. TO THE COMMITTEE. SENATOR LAYERED AND MEMBERS OF THE CAN. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY. THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE STATE'S ACCOUNTABILITY. UNDER POLICY GUIDANCE FROM THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION PREPARE AND PUBLISH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD EVERY DECEMBER. THE PURPOSE OF THE DASHBOARD IS TO PROVIDE PARENTS AND EDUCATORS WITH MEANINGFUL INFORMATION ON SCHOOL AND DISTRICT PROGRESS SO THEY CAN PARTICIPATE IN DECISIONS TO IMPROVE STUDENT LEARNING. YOU CAN FIND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE DOCK SPORT IN THE TO HAND OUTS I PROVIDED. THE DASHBOARD WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE EIGHT STATE PRIORITIES AND MEASURES BOTH CURRENT STATUS AND YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGE TO PROVIDE A MORE HOLISTIC VIEW OF HOW STUDENTS. HOW SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS ARE SERVING THEIR STUDENTS. THE DASHBOARD MEASURES TWELVE INDICATORS THE FIRST GROUP ARE REFERRED TO AS STATE INDICATORS AS THEY ARE CALCULATING CALCULATED USING DATA SUBMITTED TO C. D. E. BY EACH ELLIE EIGHT. THEY ARE CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM SUSPENSION RATE ENGLISH LEARNER PROGRESS GRADUATION RATE COLLEGE CAREER READINESS PERFORMANCE ON THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS ASSESSMENT AND PERFORMANCE ON THE MATHEMATICS ASSESSMENT. THE SECOND GROUP ARE REFERRED TO AS LOCAL INDICATORS AS EACH ELLIE A COLLECTS DATA RELATED TO THE INDICATOR AND SUBMITS THE DATA DIRECTLY INTO THE DASHBOARD INTO THEIR STAKEHOLDERS. THE LOCAL INDICATORS. MISTER CREDENTIALED TEACHERS INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS IN WELL MAINTAINED FACILITIES. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF STATE STANDARDS PARENT AND FAMILY ENGAGEMENT. SCHOOL CLIMATE AND ACCESS TO A BROAD COURSES STUDY. ADDITIONALLY COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION COMPLETE TO LOCAL INDICATORS SPECIFIC TO THEIR WORK COORDINATION OF SERVICES FOR EXPELLED STUDENTS AND COORDINATION OF SERVICES FOR FOSTER YOUTH. ALL STATE INDICATORS ARE DISAGGREGATED BY ALL THIRTEEN STUDENT GROUPS AS APPLICABLE TO EACH SCHOOL AND ELEAZAR POPULATION. THE DASHBOARD ALSO SERVES AS A MECHANISM FOR IDENTIFYING WHICH LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR ADDITIONAL HELP UNDER THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANT STRUCTURE. THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE DASHBOARD ALSO PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LOCAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN TO HELP LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES IDENTIFY AREAS OF SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGE. FOLLOWING THE DISRUPTION CAUSED BY THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC LAST SPRING GOVERNOR NEWSOM ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER WAITING STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR ASSESSMENT. SHORTLY AFTER THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION INVITED STATES TO APPLY FOR A WAIVER FOR A NUMBER OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY FEDERAL ASSESSMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS. CALIFORNIA'S WAIVER WAS APPROVED IN LATE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY. THE CANCELLATION OF THE TWENTY TWENTY SPRING ASSESSMENTS PLUS THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE END OF YOUR DATA REPORTED TO CDP THREW CAL PADS LED TO THE REALIZATION THAT THE DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD WOULD LIKELY BE LIMITED. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE SB NINETY EIGHT WAS ENACTED TO SUSPEND THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD. SB NINETY EIGHT ALSO PASSED THE IDENTIFICATION OF ELEAZAR FOR DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL YEAR OF ASSISTANCE TO ELEAZAR IDENTIFIED IN TWENTY NINETEEN. AND REQUIRED SEAT TO PUBLISH ALL COLLECTED DATA THAT WAS DEEMED VALID AND RELIABLE. MY COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WILL DISCUSS THE DEPARTMENT'S WORK DURING THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SB NINETY EIGHT AND OTHER SCHOOL AND DISTRICTS SUPPORTS. WITH THAT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DO I GATHER THEN THAT ANOTHER OF YOUR COLLEAGUES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WILL SPEAK NEXT.

FINALLY THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT HAS TAKEN ON ADDITIONAL WORK TO HELP SCHOOLS DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES ADDRESS SOME OF THE PRESSING NEED THE ANECDOTAL DATA HAS SURFACED. OUR GEOGRAPHIC LEAD AGENCIES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER LEADS ARE WORKING TO PROVIDE RESOURCES AND GUIDANCE AROUND THE USE OF LOCAL DATA AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL WELL BEING OF STUDENTS.

FIRST I WANT TO THANK EACH OF YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP DURING A PANDEMIC. HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE LIST FOR ALL OF US AND YOUR LEADERSHIP IS APPRECIATED. I VALUE THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK BRIEFLY WITH YOU TODAY TO SHARE STATEWIDE TRENDS AND STUDENT OUTCOMES AND LED NEEDS DURING THE PANDEMIC. MY COLLEAGUES TO DO XIN DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WILL ALSO SHARE THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT. WE HAVE PROVIDED AT THE CCP IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER AGENCIES TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS. WE DO NOT HAVE STATEWIDE ASSESSMENT RESULTS FROM THE TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY SCHOOL YEAR I DO BELIEVE THERE IS VALUE. IN TAKING A QUICK MOMENT TO LOOK AT THE PRE KOBE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SCHOOL YEAR RESULTS WATCH BY THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD THE FALL TWENTY NINETEEN. THIS WILL HELP PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT AS YOU CONSIDER SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS AS THEY CONTINUE RETURNED TO SCHOOL FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. OVERALL THE PERFORMANCE ON THE DASHBOARD IN TWENTY NINETEEN REFLECTED PROGRESS IN IMPORTANT AREAS SUCH AS HIGH SCHOOL RATES GRADUATION RATES AND TEST SCORES. CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM. OR SEND IN THE STATE 12% OF STUDENTS TESTED IN THE STATE MISSED MORE THAN 10% OF THE SCHOOL YEAR AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AND THE RANGERS WIDE WITH FOUR POINT 5% OF ASIAN STUDENTS CHRONICALLY ABSENT COMPARED TO TWENTY TWO POINT 5% OF AFRICAN AMERICANS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM. IT WAS AN ISSUE FOR MANY OF OUR STUDENTS PART TO THE PANDEMIC WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT WORK TO DO WHEN WE BRING STUDENTS BACK TO SCHOOL TO ENGAGE THEM. IN WAYS THAT WILL SUPPORT THEIR INTERESTS AND NEEDS OF SCHOOLS. OVERALL ACROSS THE STATE IN THE STUDENTS MOST FREQUENTLY I DIVE IDENTIFIED FOR ELIGIBILITY FOR DIFFERENT SHE'D ASSISTANCE. COULD STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WHICH PRIMARILY AT OF THE DISTRICTS IDENTIFIED FOR DIFFERENTIATED SAYS AS A HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN WERE IDENTIFIED FOR THAT SENT. A HUNDRED AND ONE FROM FOSTER USE AND SIXTY TWO FOR SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS. WITH FIFTY SEVEN PER ENGLISH LEARNERS AND FIFTY THREE FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. THOSE STATE INDICATORS AS WELL MOST STUDENTS ARE MOST ELEAZAR IDENTIFIED FOR SUSPENSION GRADUATION AND CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM. AS WELL AS FOR ACADEMIC AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY INDICATOR STATUS REGULATION AND CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM. OVERVIEW THIS DASHBOARD DATA FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN HOURS SHARE REFLECTS THE STUDENT GROUPS AND INDICATORS THAT MANY OF OUR ALLEY AS HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO NEED ASSISTANCE IN ADDRESSING. I WAS SOCIAL EMOTIONAL HEALTH SUPPORTS FOR STUDENTS AND STAFF BEING REPORTED. AS OF GREATEST CONCERN. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWENTY. FOR SCHOOL. OAKLAND YOU KNOW. SACRAMENTO CITY IN. MOUNT UNIFIED AND SALINAS UNIFIED HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICTS LOW ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE SET IN MOTION AND YOU REQUIREMENTS OPPORTUNITY OR INTENTIONAL TECHNICAL SYSTEM SUPPORT BY OUR AGENCY THE CCD. WE DETERMINE AS A SUPPORT TO WHAT WE CALL OUR SYSTEMIC INSTRUCTIONAL REVIEW% WHICH IS A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF INSTRUCTIONAL SYSTEM STRATEGIES AND PRACTICES. IS ALSO PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE STUDENT GROUPS IDENTIFIED ON THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD NOT DEMONSTRATING PROGRESS AND THE DISTRICTS APPLES. ALL FOUR OF THESE DISTRICTS QUALIFIED FOR STUDENTS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND A COMBINATION OF FOSTER STUDENTS ENGLISH LEARNERS STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND PER OAKLAND AMOUNT DIABLO AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS- IN THE PANDEMIC CCD IN COLLABORATION WITH THE DISTRICT OUNTY OFFICER AND- HAVE CONTINUED TO ADVISE AND ASSIST THESE DISTRICTS AS THEY DON'T GAUGE THE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING. DISTANCE LEARNING CONTINUITY OF LEARNING AND RESPONDING TO STUDENT GROUP NEEDS C. C. HAS COMPLETED THE SYSTEMIC REVIEWS ON SELENA'S UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT SACRAMENTO CITY OAKLAND WITH THE AIM OF COMPETING MOUNT DIABLO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICTS REVIEW IN APRIL. AS WE HAVE LEARNED FROM PROVIDING DIRECT TECHNICAL SYSTEMS WITH DISTRICTS LIKE INGLEWOOD IN THE LATE HOST CITY UNIFIED AND FROM OUR PILOT PARTNERSHIP DISTRICTS INTENSIVE SUPPORT MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED TO BUILD CAPACITY AND COULD WRAP AROUND SUPPORT. PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE AND THE COORDINATION SUPPORT SHOULD BE RESPONSIVE RESPONSIVE TO PROGRESS MONITORING DATA. IN ADDITION THE PARTNERSHIP IN COORDINATION WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM OF SUPPORT SUCH AS THE COUNTY OFFICE THE DEPARTMENT THAT HAS BEEN A CRITICAL FACTOR TRANSCEND. SUPPORT FOR HIGH NEED DISTRICTS. BASED ON THE DIRECTIVE SIR PROVIDE TO JUST AND THAT'S A RESEARCH ON THE AND- ON THE IMPACT OF KOBE NINETY GROW. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE PANDA HAS IN MANY WAYS CONTINUE TO DISPROPORTIONATELY HARM COMMUNITIES OF COLOR RESULTING IN INEQUITIES OF ACCESS TO EDUCATION. I WILL NOW ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO DO XIN TO SHARE THE EFFORT TO MEET AT THE C. SEAT BEGINNING ON MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE PANDEMIC FIRST IT. AND HOW WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE MANY NEEDS AND OTHER CURRENT EFFORTS TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY CHINA SCHOOL OF STUDENTS AT A RETURN TO SCHOOL HARM PERSON. INSTRUCTION CONTINUES. THANK YOU CARLA THANK YOU MEMBERS AFTER YOUR LEADERSHIP AND FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT WITH YOU ABOUT OUR WORK IN THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE FIELD OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST YEAR I WAS KINDA SHARE THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC CC CONSULTED WITH ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO REALLY DETERMINE THE MOST URGENT SUPPORT FOR HIGH NEED LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES THAT IS OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION CHARTER SCHOOLS. IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD RESULTS THE GOAL THERE WAS TO COLLABORATE ON A RAPID RESPONSE TO ADDRESS STUDENT ENGAGEMENT PROCESS LEARNING PROGRESS. I'M EXPAND PROFESSIONAL LEARNING AND TRANSITION TO THE SAFE RETURN IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. THROUGHOUT TWENTY TWENTY WE DEVELOP PROFESSIONAL LEARNING RESOURCES IN COLLABORATION WITH ELEAZAR AND OUR SYSTEM SUPPORT PARTNERS ARE GEOGRAPHIC LEADS ARE STATEWIDE AGENCIES AND STAKEHOLDER GROUPS. LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THESE KEY WORDS RESOURCES HERE WHICH WE'VE ALSO INCLUDED LINKS AND HANDOUTS THAT YOU'VE RECEIVED. WE HAVE A CONTINUITY OF LEARNING PLAYBOOKS WHICH FOCUSED ON PROVIDING GUIDANCE AND RESOURCES TO SUPPORT SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS FOR- INITIALLY TRANSITION. TO THE AT TO DISTANCE LEARNING OVER TIME WE THEN FOCUS ON THE TRANSITION TO HYBRID AND OR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IN A WAY THAT FOCUSEDON MAINTAINING ENGAGEMENT. FOCUSING ON SOCIAL TIONAL LEARNING ENSURING SAFETY FOR STUDENTS AND STAFF. WE ALSO FORMER DISTANCE LEARNING CONSORTIUM PARTNERING WITH FOR COUNTY OFFICES TO BUILD ONLINE LESSONS AND TOOLS IN MULTIPLE SUBJECT AREAS AND GRADE LEVELS. AND INCLUDED SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING AND ENGAGEMENT RESOURCES. AND THEN WORKING WITHIN THE SYSTEM SUPPORT TIGHTEN UP MY OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND ACCESS AND INSEMINATION OF THESE RESOURCES TO THOSE COUNTY OFFICES. DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE. WE ALSO THE X. LEARNING SO AND IS NICK. WHERE WE PARTNER DIRECTLY WITH THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDER WORKING DIRECTLY WITH SOME OF OUR LOWEST PERFORMING ALLEY ACE AND THE COUNTY OFFICES IN PARTNERSHIP TO SUPPORT EFFORTS TO ACCELERATE LEARNING FOR STUDENTS. AND THEN FROM NOT WORK CREATING UNIVERSALLY ACCESSIBLE TOOLS GUIDES AND PROFESSIONAL LEARNING RESOURCES AS A RESULT OF THIS WORK IS SUPPORTED USING IMPLEMENTATION OF RESOURCES AND THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THIS AFTER ANY SCHOOL OR DISTRICT TEAM ACROSS THE STATE. AND THEN FROM THERE WE HAVE A FIELD GUIDE FOR ACCELERATED LEARNING EQUITY AND WELL BEING WE TOOK THE LESSONS LEARNED AND BEST PRACTICES. L. U. DEVELOP TOOLS AND RESOURCES FOCUSING ON MAXIMIZING EQUITY AND LEVERAGING HIGH QUALITY INSTRUCTION FOR STUDENTS IN THE SPACE TO SHARE BACK OUT WIDELY. ACROSS THE STATE. THESE FREE ONLINE PROFESSIONAL RESOURCES AGAIN IN YOUR HANDOUT WERE ACCESSED BY OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND TEACHERS ADMINISTRATORS AND CLASSIFIED STAFF FROM CAUGHT OVER THREE THOUSAND COUNTY OFFICES. SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE AGAIN REFERENCING TOOLS BEST PRACTICES AND LESSONS LEARNED THAT ARE LOCALLY TO WRAP AND DEVELOPED AND WILL BE TESTING. FINALLY BASED ON FEEDBACK LESSONS LEARNED ITS ONGOING RESEARCH ON JANUARY TWENTY FIVE OF THIS YEAR WE LAUNCHED OUR LEADING FORWARD SERIES- TO THE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING INITIATIVE THAT FOCUSES ON PROVIDING TANGIBLE TOOLS TRAINING AND GUIDANCE. AB ORGANIZED AROUND FIVE KEY CRITICAL QUESTIONS THE FIRST IS AROUND DRIVING SOCIO EMOTIONALLY HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT STUDENTS ARE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITIES TOOLS AND SUPPORTS TO THRIVE BOTH SO COS MOTION ONLY AS WELL AS ACADEMICALLY. SECOND ROUND FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT HOW DO WE MEASURE STUDENT NEED IN PROGRESS TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE SUPPORTING THE WHOLE CHILD AT THIS TIME. I'M THIRD AROUND RESPONSIVE TEACHING AND LEARNING WHAT DOES INSTRUCTION NOW NEED TO LOOK LIKE IN THIS SPACE AND WE'RE CURRENTLY IN IN ORDER TO ENSURE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR EACH AND EVERY CHILD REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN AND WHERE THEY ARE NOW. FOR AROUND SYSTEMS LEADERSHIP HOW DO WE SUPPORT SYSTEMS LEADERSHIP FROM OUR VARIED ROLES AS A CLASSROOM SCHOOL PARENT FAMILY LEADERS CENTER AT THE TRULY SUPPORT THE WHOLE CHILD THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. AND THEN FINALLY AROUND THE DANCING EQUITY HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO DO THIS WORK SUPPORT SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS AND COMMUNITIES WHILE MAINTAINING A FOCUS ON ADVANCING EQUITY FOR STUDENTS SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD OF CONTINUED DISTANCE AND HYBRID LEARNING AS WE REALLY PREPARE FOR THAT RETURN TO SCHOOLS. AND SO AS WE THINK ABOUT NEXT STEPS TO ADDRESS THE CRITICAL NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS WE WOULD PROVIDE THREE STRONG RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON OUR RESEARCH OUR BEST PRACTICES AND THE LESSONS LEARNED THAT WE'VE GATHERED FROM OUR WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES TEAMS ACROSS THE STATE.NUMBER ONE WE'D REALLY LOVE TO ENCOURAGED STRONGLY SUPPORTING ELEAZAR I CANNOT COUNTY OFFICES ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTERS WITH RESOURCES THAT INCLUDE ACCESS TO RESEARCH AND TRAINING THAT OUR DOCKS A PHASED. IN APPROACH TO INDIGENOUS STUDENTS AND TO THAT WORK PRIOR. STUDENT SO SHE EMOTIONAL. AS WELL AS SAFE. NUMBER TWO WE THAT THEY SHOULD INCLUDES FOR LEN TO FOCUS ON PEER CONNECTIONS STRENGTHENING RELATIONSHIPS WITH TEACHERS AND DEEPLY ENGAGING WITH FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE SPENT THE LAST YEAR CO TEACHING THEIR CHILDREN AT HOME. IN THIRD. WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE IN AND INVESTMENT IN TRAINING THAT INCLUDES COACHING AND MENTORING OPPORTUNITIES AND ANCHORED AROUND STRONG PROFESSIONAL LEARNING PEDAGOGY TO SUPPORT THE EXONERATION OF LEARNING FOR STUDENTS INCLUDING EACH YEAR TO SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS TO ALLOW THEM. TO ACCESS GRADE LEVEL CURRICULUM AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS NEEDED TO REALLY FOCUS ON ACCELERATING THEIR LEARNING AND TO THE DEGREE THAT WE CAN LESSEN THAT FOCUS ON LANDS ON WITH MEDIATION. SO I CAN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED TODAY HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE BEEN AND OBVIOUSLY I'M JOINED HERE BY MY COLLEAGUE KARLA ESTRADA AS WELL AS OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TOM ARE MOVING NOW. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANKS TO EVERYBODY IN THE PANEL- I THINK WE HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS- HERE. AND I SORT OF WANT TO BEGIN. WITH MAYBE A MORE LAY PERSON'S QUESTION EITHER FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OR THE COLLABORATIVE. AND IT'S I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WITH REGARD TO ACCOUNTABILITY. WHAT IN ITS TOTALITY WAS SUSPENDED DURING THE PANDEMIC EITHER BY EXECUTIVE ORDER OR BUDGET ACTION OR FEDERAL APPROVAL. AND WHETHER IT JUST AUTOMATICALLY KICKS BACK IN IN THE NEXT YEAR UNLESS WE TAKE FURTHER ACTION AND WHETHER YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT. IT SHOULD JUST COME BACK A BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW NOW- AS WE MOVE INTO NEXT YEAR MAYBE WE COULD START WITH THE COLLABORATIVE AND SEE IF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS ANY COMMENT ON. CARLESS DRIVER THE COLLABORATIVE- SO AS FAR AS- ACCOUNTABILITY THE SUPPORT HAS RESULTED FROM THE DASHBOARD FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN DATA AND RESULTS WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DISTRICTS ON THE SYSTEMIC INSTRUCTIONAL REVIEWS SO DOING THAT COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT TO SEE WHAT THE NEEDS ARE- ARE DISTRICTS IN PARTICULAR THAT WERE IDENTIFIED FOR OUR TYPE OF SUPPORTER. HIS NEED OF SUPPORT REALLY IDENTIFIED BEING ABLE TO CONTINUE TO EXAMINE INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES DURING THE PANDEMIC THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL FOR THEIR LONG TERM PLANNING AS WELL AS WHEN THEY RETURN. TO TRADITIONAL SCHOOLING SO WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THAT TYPE OF SUPPORT NO WORD ON WHEN I'M GETTING FROM YOUR COMMENT IS THAT. IT WAS SUSPENDED AND BASED ON THE PREVIOUS YEAR YOU CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. THE IN GENERAL WHAT WAS SUSPENDED AND WHETHER IT'S COMING BACK NEXT YEAR AND MAYBE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ACCESS TO TAKE A STAB. AT OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT ON THAT. MORNING CHAIRMAN LAND ELLIE GARNER FOR THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE SUSPENDED INCLUDE THE FEDERAL AND STATE REQUIREMENTS AT THE CSI THE TS I IDENTIFICATION AND THE 95% WAIVER. A NUMBER OF WAYS I'M REALLY SORRY TO DO THIS BUT IT IT'S- THERE'S BOUND TO PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW SOME OF THE ACRONYMS THAT YOU'RE USING. YOU KNOW WHAT ABSOLUTELY AND I THINKTHAT WE WOULD BE BETTER SERVED ACTUALLY IF I DEFER THEM TO. MY COLLEAGUE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT RACHEL NAMES WHO IS- REALLY THE EXPERT IN THIS SPACE AND SO RACHEL DO YOU MIND GOING FROM HERE. NO PROBLEM RACHEL MEANS ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HELLO EVERYONE- THAT THERE THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF THINGS THAT WERE SUSPENDED UNDER FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AS WELL STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY. AND IF THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY WE'RE ARE I'M REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY OUR LOWEST WHICH INCLUDES WHAT ELLIE JUST SHARE THE TSA AND CSI THAT IS OUR COMPREHENSIVE SUPPORT FOR IMPROVEMENT IDENTIFICATION AS WELL AS OUR TARGETED SUPPORT FOR IMPROVEMENT. IDENTIFICATION BASED ON OUR DASHBOARD WERE WAIVED AS WELL AS THE REQUIREMENT BOTH STATE AND FEDERALLY TO ADMINISTER OUR ASSESSMENTS- FOR LAST YEAR. ADDITIONALLY THE REQUIREMENT- THAT WE WOULD REPORT THE DATA ON THE DASHBOARD FOR THE ACADEMIC INDICATORS WAS WAIVED AS WELL. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE WAIVED IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING. ON THAT. FOR THIS YEAR THOSE REQUIREMENTS HAVE- THOSE WAIVER REQUESTS HAVE SENSE SUNSET AND CURRENTLY WE ARE. WE IN FOR AND EAT EAT S. SIGNAL WHAT POTENTIALLY MIGHT BE AVAILABLE FOR THIS NEXT YEAR. THANK YOU AND- AND I'M SORRY TO ASK ANOTHER FOLLOW UP THE TO LIVE PERSON EVERYBODY ALWAYS USES THE WORD ASSESSMENT. IS THERE ANYTHING BESIDES STANDARDIZED TESTING THAT IS AN ASSESSMENT OR IS THAT A. REFERENCE TO STANDARDIZED TESTING. A LONG. WHEN YOU SAID. THE THIS IS ACTUALLY A GREAT QUESTION SO THERE ARE STANDARDIZED TESTS INCLUDE A NUMBER OF ASSESSMENTS- LAST YEAR WE- WERE GRANTED THE WAY FOR R. E. L. A. AND MATH ASSESSMENTS FOR OUR ALTERNATIVE ASSESSMENTS B. L. PACK- SUMMATIVE WAS ALSO WEIGHED THE L. TECHNICIAN FOR THIS YEAR WAS AND STILL AM REQUIRED IN IN PLACE COMMISSARS EXCELLENT. WHAT TO POWER PACK STAND FOR. I'M ENGLISH LEARNER PROFESSION GROUP PROFICIENCY PROCESS THANK YOU. A. M. THEN ARM. IT THE OTHER THING THAT I WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IT AND WHAT YOU SAID IS THIS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE TO GRANT A WAIVER FOR THE STATE TO SUSPEND ASSESSMENTS OR IS IT JUST THE STATE DOES ASSESSMENTS AS PER STATE LAW THEY CAN SUSPENDED ON THE STATE LEVEL BUT THEY DON'T GET TO REALLY SUSPENDED UNTIL THE FEDS GRANT A WAIVER IS THAT CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT IT REQUIRES BOTH OKAY. SODA IF THE GOVERNOR DID AN EXECUTIVE ORDER WHICH SHE DID IT JUST DOESN'T REALLY TAKE AFFECT UNTIL THE OF THE FEDS GRANT THE WAIVER ON TOP OF IT THAT IS CORRECT AND HOW LONG HAS IT TAKEN THE FEDS TO DO AWAY FOR IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC. IT DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF WAIVER THE AND BITES- THE LAST WAIVER THAT THEY ISSUED WAS STREAMLINED WAIVER WHICH AT THEIR INVITATION. BASED SIGNALED THROUGH STATES THAT IF WE SUBMITTED THIS WAIVER IT WOULD BE GRANTED ONLY. IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH A GENERAL WAIVER PROCESS AND THAT PROCESS COULD TAKE MONTHS. AND THEN IT'S EXPECTED THAT FOR THE NEXT SCHOOL YEAR. EVERYTHING WILL COME BACK IT SUGGESTED WE WILL ALL MAKE AN ASSESSMENT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR WHETHER THERE'S SOMETHING FROM THE PANDEMIC THAT STILL IN EFFECT WOULD CAUSE. A REASON NOT TO COME BACK FULLY IN THE ASSESSMENTS IN THE DASHBOARD IS THAT RIGHT. THAT IS CORRECT FOR THIS NEXT YEAR BUT THAT'S ALSO CORRECT READ THIS YEAR AS WELL SO I AT THIS TIME WE ARE CURRENTLY PENDINE- ANY WAIVER FROM THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH ASSESSMENTS. NO I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THIS YOU MEAN FOR THE CURRENT SCHOOL YEAR WERE IN. YES THAT WAS GREAT HOW CAN A AND IS THAT BASED ASSESSMENTS AFTER DISTANCE LEARNING IS THAT BASICALLY WIDE ASSESSMENTS ARE CONTINUING. AND GOING TO DO IT. I'M SORRY. THE SCHOOLS OF OVERWHELMINGLY BEEN AND DISTANCE LEARNING SO IT'S REALLY AN ASSESSMENT IN GENERAL OF DISTANCE LEARNING OF THE SUCCESS OR THE PROGRESS MADE AS A RESULT OR NOT MADE AS A RESULT OF DISTANCE LEARNING. YES IT WOULD IT WOULD BE A SIMILAR TALL ASSESSMENTS ACTUALLY I WOULD SAY WITH THE SUMMIT IF IS THAT IT WOULD BE AN ASSESSMENT OF TEACHING AND LEARNING AND FOR THIS YEAR WITH IN THE CONTEXT OF KOPEN. AND WILL THERE BE SOME SPECIAL VALUE TO THAT BECAUSE- THERE CAN BE A TRUE ASSESSMENT OF. DISTANCE LEARNING AND IF. IT GOT FOR BID BUT BUT IF I WAS EVER A TIME WE HAD TO DO DISTANCE LEARNING AGAIN. THE ASSESSMENT WOULD GIVE US A READ ON HOW TO WEAR THE DEFICIENCIES WERE IN DISTANCE LEARNING. WE WOULD HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTAND OF THAT UNDERSTANDING OF THAT OF ONCE WE COLLECT THE DATA TAT TO SEE THIS THE WHAT THE VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY OF THE DATA WOULD BE BUT THAT IS OUR WHOLE. THANK YOU. AND THEN LET ME ASK THE COLLABORATIVE A QUESTION BECAUSE- AND I DIDN'T KEEP A LIST OF THE SCHOOLS YOU TALKED ABOUT TWO SCHOOLS THAT YOU DID TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO ONE FOR WYO I REMEMBER THAT BECAUSE I'M- PROBABLY THE ONLY MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT'S PRODUCT OF THE HIGHER PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. AND THEN YOU SAID FOR THAT YOU'RE DOING AND R. ONE WAS SALINAS. WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE YOU OFFERED TO THOSE FIRST TWO. THAT WILL HELP YOU WITH THE NEXT FOR THAT YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE KNOWN. WHEN YOU STARTED OUT DOING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. SHIN SO WE'VE LEARNED A LOT FROM WORKING WITH INGLEWOOD UNIFIED AS WELL AS VALLEJO CITY UNIFIED- PRIMARILY WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF EFFORT THAT NEEDS TO BE PROVIDE- THAT ME SO CURRENT. AND BUILDING CAPACITY- ON EITHER HE INSTRUCTIONAL SYSTEMS AND STRUCTURES THAT MAYBE THEY'VE BEEN MISSING SO THINGS LIKE WHAT ARE YOUR INSTRUCTIONAL PRIORITIES WHAT ARE YOUR BENCHMARKS AND TARGETS AND HOW DO WE START TO REALLY ENGAGE IN CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT CYCLES. TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE MAKING THE PROPER HE CAME TO- ACHIEVE. THE OTHER THING WE HAVE FOUND IS THAT PROFESSIONAL LEARNING OR KINDS OF SUPPORTS FOR TEACHERS REALLY SHOULD BE GROUNDED ON A FEW PARTIES TOO OFTEN MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS ARE TRYING TO TAKE ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS. AND WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME ISSUES OF EQUITY A REALLY REQUIRES YOU TO LOOK AT THE OVERALL INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY BUT THEN TRY TO SEE WHAT NEEDS TO BE UNIQUE FOR CERTAIN STUDENT GROUPS. AND SO BUILDING THEIR CAPACITY WORKING WITH THEIR TEACHERS TO BE ABLE TO- LEARN WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST PRACTICES TO BENEFIT THOSE STUDENTS PRIMARILY. WE'VE ALSO FOUND THAT SOME PROCEDURES FOR EXAMPLE ESPECIALLY FOR STUDENTS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WE FIND THAT. WE MAY NEED TO ESTABLISH STRONGER PROCEDURES THAT OCCUR ALL YEAR LONG RATHER THAN AT THE TIME OF REGISTRATION OR THINGS LIKE THAT TO ENSURE THAT THOSE STUDENTS WHO NEED THOSE SUPPORTS THE MOST. OF THEM THROUGHOUT THE YEAR RATHER THAN AT CERTAIN PERIODS OF TIME IN THE YEAR- AND THEN I WOULD SAY LASTLY THE OTHER THING WE HAVE FOUND IS THAT WE NEED TO ALSO INVEST IN SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT EITHER ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE COUNTY OFFICE- A THROUGH C. D. THROUGH CCTV TO ENSURE THAT THOSE- TARGETED. AREAS WHERE WE'RE SEEING THE MOST INTENSIVE INTERVENTION IS NEEDED THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THAT KIND OF DAY TO DAY SUPPORT IN PRACTICE OF ORGANISED. THE ACCELERATION OF IMPROVEMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYBODY ELSE WISH TO. ON THAT BEFORE WE MOVE ON. THEN LET ME. ASK SENATOR MEN SENATOR MAN HAS NO QUESTIONS. SOLET ME THANK THIS PANEL WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ISSUE TO BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS AND TRAILER BILL PROPOSALS WE HAVE DOCTOR MERRY SANDY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING. AND KIM LEAHY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LET'S BEGIN WITH DOCTOR CINDY. WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU SO MUCH A GOOD MORNING SENATOR THERE'D MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE MY NAME IS MERRY SIXTY SANTEE ALLEY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING. AS INDICATED ON YOUR AGENDA IN YOUR AGENDA MATERIALS THE COMMISSION HIS CALIFORNIA'S INDEPENDENT STANDARDS FOR. THE RESPONSIBLE FOR CREDENTIALING THE EDUCATION WORKFORCE ACCREDITING APPROVED SPONSORS OF EDUCATOR PREPARATION AND ENFORCING STANDARDS OF PRACTICE AND CONDUCT FOR CREDENTIALED EDUCATORS. IN ADDITION THE COMMISSION ESTABLISHES AND MAINTAINS EXAMINATIONS AND PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS FOR EDUCATORS AND ADMINISTERS FEATURE. RECRUITMENT GRANTS. SHINN'S OPERATING BUDGET IS SUPPORTED BY CREDENTIAL AND EXAMINATION FEES I'M PLEASED TO REPORT THAT WE ARE IN REASONABLY GOOD SHAPE ALL THINGS CONSIDERED THIS YEAR. OR YEAR TO DATE REVENUES ARE DOWN BUT OUR RESERVES ARE SUFFICIENT TO CARRY US THROUGH AND WE'RE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF THOSE DETAILS. DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR WE RECEIVED SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER CREDENTIAL APPLICATIONS THAN USUAL MOSTLY FROM THE RANKS OF SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE THERE HAVEN'T BEEN CLASSROOMS TO SUBSTITUTE TEACH IN. AND THAT POPULATION HAS SLOWED DOWN IN OUR CREDENTIAL APPLICATION POOL. WE ATTRIBUTE THIS TO SCHOOL CLOSURES AND EXPECT THAT OUR SCHOOLS REOPEN THIS SPRING WILL BEGIN TO SEE AN INCREASE IN THIS CATEGORY OF CREDENTIALS. SO THIS TIME LAST YEAR. THE COMMISSION WAS PLANNING FOR SIGNIFICANT INFUSION OF FUNDING TO SUPPORT TEACHER RESIDENCIES AND OTHER RECRUITMENT PROGRAMS. TO WORK TOWARD ELIMINATING TEACHER SHORTAGES. WE HAD RECEIVED FUNDING OR TO THE PRESCHOOL DEVELOPMENT GRANT RENEWAL TO LAUNCH SIGNIFICANT NEW WORK IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. DEPENDING ARE WORK WITH PREPARATION PROGRAMS TO FULLY IMPLEMENT PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS AND ENGAGING IN DEEP CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FIELD ABOUT OUR CURRENT TEACHER EXAMINATIONS PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF READING. ON MARCH NINETEENTH OF COURSE WE HAD A HARD STOP. SCHOOLS AND INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION CLOSED THEIR BUILDINGS AND MOVED QUICKLY TO IMPLEMENT ONLINE INSTRUCTION AND FINISH OUT THE SCHOOL YEAR. OUR EMPLOYEES TRANSITION TO TELEWORK AND LIKE EVERY OTHER ENTERPRISES WE WERE FACED WITH THE QUESTION WHAT DO WE DO NOW. PERHAPS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ISSUE WE WERE FACED WITH WAS THE IMPACT OF SCHOOL CLOSURES AND THE MOVE TO ONLINE LEARNING IN CLINICAL PRACTICE FOR TEACHERS IN TRAINING. ALL AND THE CLOSURE OF- TESTING CENTERS FOR TEACHERS WAS ALSO A CRITICAL CRITICAL IMPACT. THE PIPELINE INTO TEACHING WAS ESSENTIALLY SHUT DOWN IN THE SPRING OF THIS YEAR BRIEFLY. TEACHERS WHO NEEDED TO COMPLETE THEIR STUDENT TEACHING AND PASS TESTS AND PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS TO EARN THEIR CREDENTIALS WOULD NOT DO SO BECAUSE TESTING CENTERS WERE CLOSED. NEITHER COULD PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS WHO ARE SEEKING TO ENROLL IN TEACHER PREPARATION COMPLETE THEIR BASIC SKILLS OR SUBJECT MATTER TESTING IN ORDER TO GET IN. SO IN EARLY JUNE THE GOVERNOR SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER POSTPONING THE DATES BY WHICH TEACHERS COULD NOT MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS ALLOWING PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS TO ENTER PREPARATION. COMPLETE THEIR BASIC SKILLS AND SUBJECT MATTER MATTER REQUIREMENTS PRIOR TO EARNING THEIR CREDENTIALS AND ALLOWING TEACHERS IN TRAINING TO EARN THEIR CREDENTIALS AND BEGIN TEACHING LAST FALL. THEY WERE ALLOWED THROUGH THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER TO COMPLETE THEIR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS IN THE READING INSTRUCTIONAL COMPETENCE TEST FOR THOSE WHO NEEDED IT. DURING THEIR FIRST YEARS OF TEACHING. LAST YEAR'S TRAILER BILL EXTENDED THESE ALLOWANCES FOR ANOTHER YEAR AGAIN PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT AND IMPORTANT SUPPORT TO KEEP OUR PIPELINE INTO TEACHING. MOVING FORWARD. IN ADDITION THE COMMISSION ENGAGED WITH THE PREPARATION COMMUNITY WHO IDENTIFY OTHER PROGRAMMATIC REQUIREMENTS THE COULD BE SUSPENDED MOVED OR ADJUSTED. AT ITS FOR A CREDENTIAL WHO WERE UNABLE TO COMPLETE ALL REQUIREMENTS LAST YEAR DUE TO CODE RELATED SCHOOL CLOSURES. WERE ELIGIBLE TO BEGIN TEACHING ON WAIVERS AND TO COMPLETE THOSE PROGRAMS WITHIN ONE YEAR. WE ARE FORTUNATE IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE HAVE AN INDUCTION PROGRAM FOR NEW TEACHERS- THAT DIDN'T PICK THEM UP WHEN THEY COMPLETE PREPARATION AND HELPS THEM TO GET GROUNDED IN TEACHING. YOUR INTENSIVE SUPPORT AND MENTORING WHILE THEY ON BOARD. MISSION STAFF HAVE BEEN WORKING INTENSIVELY WITH THESE COMMUNITIES OF PREPARATION AND INDUCTION THE SMOOTH THE TRANSITION FOR TEACHERS WHO'VE EXPERIENCED THESE INTERRUPTIONS WHERE PREPARATION PATHWAYS. WERE ENCOURAGED BY THE COMMITMENT OF EDUCATORS ACROSS THE CONTINUUM TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT NEEDED TO SUSTAIN NEW TEACHERS COMING THROUGH THIS YEAR. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS IN THIS BUDGET WHERE SITE LOOKING INTO THE TESTING ISSUES THAT THAT STOPPED US THIS YEAR. COURT FOR THE BASIC SKILLS TESTS WOULD BE OF THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES THAT WOULD CREATE YET- ADDITIONAL ALTERNATIVE WAY IN WHICH CANDIDATES TO MEET THIS REQUIREMENT. THEY'RE ALREADY EXIST OTHER ROUTE OTHER- OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET THE BASIC SKILLS REQUIREMENTS BUT WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING HERE IS TO RECOGNIZE HIGH LEVEL PERFORMANCE IN UNDERGRADUATE COURSEWORK AS MEETING. THE REQUIREMENT FOR BASIC SKILLS IN READING WRITING AND MATHEMATICS. WE BELIEVE THIS WILL EASE UP. I WORK OPPORTUNITIES AND CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TEACHERS TO MOVE INTO TEACHER PREPARATION WHICH IS REALLY WHERE WE WANT THEM IN ORDER TO GET THEM INTO THE PROFESSION. SIMILARLY WITH THE SUBJECT MATTER EXAMINATION THE CALIFORNIA SUBJECT EXAMINEE TEACHERS WERE C. SAID. WELL WE ARE ALREADY HEALTH OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY ENACTED. PLEASE CALL MULTIPLE PATHWAYS MEET THIS REQUIREMENT EITHER THROUGH TO. AND IT'S A IT'S LIKE A BACCALAUREATE DEGREE IN A SUBJECT AREA THEY ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WITH THIS TEST I USED TO LOOK AT IN A WAY TO COMBINE THESE APPROACHES WERE CANDIDATES WHO MIGHT TAKE THE TEST ONCE- AND MAYBE PASSED TWO OF THE SUBTESTS BILL THE THIRD TEST WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPLETE COURSEWORK THAT IS EQUIVALENT TO THAT WERE AND AN EQUALLY RIGOROUS TO DEMONSTRATE SUBJECT MATTER COMPETENCE. ALSO THAT OPPORTUNITY WE ALSO SEE AS A WAY OF INCREASING PATHWAYS INTO TEACHER PREPARATION WHERE THE REAL WORK OF PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER BEGINS ON THE CLOSURE OF TESTING CENTERS THIS YEAR- SHED A HARSH LIGHT ON WHAT WE WERE SUBJECT TO BEEN HELD UP BY. WE NEED IN THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A PIPELINE OF TEACHERS MOVING FORWARD HAVING TESTING CENTERS CLOSE AND STOP THAT PIPELINE IS REALLY NOT A GOOD POLICY STANCE WE'RE GOOD PROGRAMMATIC STANDS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THESE PROPOSALS WE BELIEVE WILL ADD NOT JUST AS A SOLUTION TO AN EMERGENCY SHORT TERM PROBLEM. BUT CREATE LEGITIMATE AND IMPORTANT ALTERNATIVES FOR TEACHERS TO MEET THEIR ENTRY LEVEL REQUIREMENTS SO THAT THEY CAN BENEFIT FROM PREPARATION AND MOVING TO TEACHING FINALLY THE FUNDING THAT IS SET ASIDE FOR UPDATING TEST WILL BE AVAILABLE THEN FOR THE COMMISSION TO TAKE A LOOK AT ITS READING INSTRUCTIONAL COMPETENCE ASSESSMENT. WHICH HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF LEGISLATION FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF SESSIONS ARE AND TO BEGIN TO SERIOUSLY UPDATED WE HAVE NOT UPDATED THAT TEST FOR A WHILE AND IT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT AGAIN IN TERMS OF EMERGING SCIENCE OF READING. THE NEW FRAMEWORKS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT TESTING OVERALL WE HAVE SOME OPPORTUNITY TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THAT TESTING PROGRAM OF. THERE'S NEW LEGISLATION- THAT WOULD ALTER. HOW THAT ASSIST OCCURRED. RESPONSE WILL ALLOW US TO BE UPDATE THE EXIST. SYSTEM THAT WE OR- A SYSTEM THAT IS AND I BY THE LEAD. THIS YEAR. URGED BY THE ADMINISTRATION'S. THIS YEAR- AND LOOKING FORWARD TO RECOVERY FROM KOBE- AND GETTING SOMEWHERE NEAR NORMAL AGAIN- AS WE AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS TUNNEL THIS YEAR IN BACK INTO. SOMEWHAT NORMAL- EQUITIES ARE HUMAN WE ALL ARE. A THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS LET'S MOVE TO. A KIMBERLY LEAHY AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD MORNING KIMBERLY LEAHY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. DOCTOR SANDY- JUST MENTION TO THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING IS THE STATE AGENCY THAT. GOVERNS ALL TEACHER CREDENTIALING AND- EDUCATOR LICENSING EXAMINATION MATTERS- THE COMMISSION'S OPERATIONS ARE SUPPORTED BY EDUCATOR LICENSING AND EXAMINATIONS BEES. I'M GOING TO COVER IT UP PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT RELATE TO MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT THAT THAT THAT MERRY SANDY JUST MENTIONS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING WITH A WORKLOAD BUDGET OF NEARLY THIRTY ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS THIS INCLUDES TWENTY THREE POINT ONE MILLION IN TEACHER CREDENTIALS FUND. SIX POINT FOUR MILLION AND TEST DEVELOPMENT AND ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNT FUND AND ONE POINT SIX MILLION IN REIMBURSEMENT AUTHORITY. SPECIFIC CHANGES IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR THE COMMISSION INCLUDE. AN INCREASE OF TWO MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME TEST DEVELOPMENT AND ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNT YOUR SUPPORT UPDATES TO EDUCATOR TESTING INCLUDNG CALIFORNIA BASIC EDUCATIONAL SKILLS TEST THE CALIFORNIA SUBJECT EXAMINATIONS TESTS AND A DOCTOR SEND YOU MENTIONED THE READING INSTRUCTION COMPETENCE ASSESSMENT. THIS AMOUNT OF FUNDING MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT AT THE MAY REVISION AS THE COMMISSION FINALIZES STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS SELECTS A RECOMMENDATION FOR IMPLEMENTATION. THE BUDGET PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES AN INCREASE OF ONE POINT THREE MILLION ONE TIME REIMBURSEMENT AUTHORITY TO SUPPORT ACTIVITIES OUTLINED IN THE FEDERAL PRESCHOOL DEVELOPMENT GRANT RENEWAL AWARD INCLUDING DEVELOPMENTS HAVE A TEACHING PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT FOR CANDIDATES SEEKING A TEACHER LEVEL CHILD DEVELOPMENT PERMIT. BECAUSE IT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS TO THE COMMISSION'S WORKLOAD BUDGET THAT REFLECT PROJECTED TEMPORARY DECREASES ONE CREDENTIAL AND EXAMINATIONS REVENUES IN BOTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO DUE TO THE CODE NINETEEN IN HAWKE'S. IN ADDITION THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD PROVIDE A PATHWAY FOR CREDENTIAL CANDIDATES TO DEMONSTRATE BASIC SKILLS PROFICIENCY AND SUBJECT MATTER COMPETENCE THROUGH SUBJECT THROUGH EXCUSE ME THROUGH COURSEWORK FROM A PREPARATION PROGRAM. WITH THAT I'M AT THE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS FROM. THANK YOU WE REALLY APPRECIATE PRESENTATION I HAVE ONE QUESTION A MOMENT FOR DOCTOR SANDY BUT WHAT ME JUST SAY THAT. THE IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR THE STAFF TO CALENDAR THIS BECAUSE YOU HAD TO DO THE BUDGET PART AND THEN YOU HAD TO DO THE POLICY PART. CAN UNDERSTAND THE BUDGET PARK WITHOUT EXPLAINING TO POLICY PART SO- SIX ONE THE POLICY PART SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE BUDGET AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL REFLECT IN BRIEFER PRESENTATIONS ON THE NEXT ITEM OUR OUR THAT THAT HAS HAPPENED. IT AND MY ONE QUESTION FOR DOCTOR SANDY EVEN THOUGH EVERYBODY DESCRIBED WHAT WAS IN THE BUDGET. OF DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH REVENUES PROPOSED TO MEET WHAT IS BEING ASKED OF YOU IN THE TRAILER BILL. SENATOR WITH REGARD TO THESE PROPOSALS YES WE DO ARE THEY BOTH SPEND CONCEPTUALIZED AS WORK THAT WILL OCCUR WITHIN AT THE PROGRAM LEVEL- OF SO THE INSTITUTION SO WE'RE CREDIT THE TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS TO ADMIT THESE CANDIDATES WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENACTING AND ACTUALLY DOING THE ANALYSIS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE IF THE CANDIDATE IS MET THESE REQUIREMENTS. THE COMMISSION'S WORK IN THIS WILL BE JUST THAT THAT THE GRANDMOTHERS AND GUIDELINES FOR THAT ONE WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY WITH OUR CURRENT STAFF AND FUNDING TO SET THIS PROGRAM UP AND IN MOTION AND TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE CREDIT. AS THEY AS THEY MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS NEW OPPORTUNITY NORMALLY I WOULD ASK THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COMMENT BUT I WILL JUST STIPULATE TO DOLBY THRILLED. TO HEAR THAT THEIR RECOMMENDATION FOR FUNDS YOU AND THERE'S NO NEED FOR THEM TO A SPEAK TO THEIR PERSONAL THRILL AT- AT THAT COMMENT. OF SENATOR. MEN DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THE SIDE. YES I HAVE A MORAL QUALMS YOUR MIKE. YES FIVE AREA I HAD A MORE OF A QUAL QUESTION FOR DOCTOR SANDY- IN THEIR- AROUND THIS TOPIC I I'VE HEARD A LOT OF ANECDOTAL AROUND TEACHER MORALE. AND THAT MIGHT BE REFLECTED IN SOME OF THE CREDENTIALING DRAFTERS IN NAP OF COURSE CODE PLAYS A BIG PART OF ANY BASIS- IF YOU KNOW TO THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE MIGHT FACE A DIFFERENT TRANSPOSE COVERT- WILL WE SEE A SHARP RISE IN TEACHER CREDENTIALING REQUEST A NEW TEACHERS COMING IN. OR ARE SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED ABOUT TEACHER MORALE POST CODE VISION AND MY WE SHOULD DROP ASSOCIATED WITH THAT IN SOME OF THE ACTIVITY ASSOCIATED. WITH YOUR- PARTICULAR- EMISSION. SENATOR MAN I THINK THIS IS A VERY FLUID SITUATION AND WE SHOULD IN FACT EXPECT THE TEACHERS ARE UNDER A FAIR AMOUNT OF PRESSURE AS THE MOVE BACK INTO TEACHING DURING COPE WITH THIS SPRING- WE'RE ALL DEEPLY HOPEFUL THAT WE THAT THE VACCINE WILL BE YOU KNOW FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND WE'LL GET BACK TO THE NORMAL BUSINESS OF THE FALL BUT I THINK STUDENTS FAMILIES AND TEACHERS OF ALL NEED. THE EXTRA MEASURE OF SUPPORT THAT WE CAN GIVE THEM AS THEY GET BACK INTO THAT ENVIRONMENT TO DO WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO WE HEAR- ANECDOTALLY THAT THERE ARE TEACHERS WHO DON'T FEEL UP TO IT AND MAY RETIRE IN MAY YOU KNOW EARLIER THAN THEY HAD EXPECTED- BUT WE'RE WE'RE VERY ENCOURAGED ACTUALLY THIS YEAR OF ALL YEARS THIS ACADEMIC YEAR THAT WE'RE IN WE'RE HEARING ANECDOTALLY FROM PREPARATION PROGRAMS THAT ENROLLMENT IN TEACHER EDUCATION- UP. IN ROMANS AND HIGHER EDUCATION ARE ARE DOWN OVERALL BUT IN ROMANS IN TEACHER EDUCATION APPEAR TO BE GOING UP WE'RE HEARING THAT APPLICATION AND INTEREST IN ENROLLMENT FOR NEXT YEAR- IS HIGHER THAN IN PRIOR YEARS AS WELL SO I'M VERY ENCOURAGED BY THAT I THINK- TEACHERS THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE IN COMING UP THROUGH COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WHO SEE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK IN TEACHING AND THEIR CALL TO IT AND THEY'RE RUNNING TOWARD IT. WELL AND WE WANT TO GRAB HIM SHE KEPT HIM PREPARE TO CREDENTIAL DISCREETLY AS WE CAN'T- SO IT IS A VERY FLUID SITUATION AND- I'M NERVOUS ABOUT WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN THIS SPRING IN TERMS OF WORKFORCE THE ABILITY STAFF CLASSROOMS BUT I'M DEEPLY ENCOURAGED BY THOSE WHO HAVE REALLY IMPROVED THEIR PRACTICE I HEAR THE SITE EXCITEMENT TOO MANY TEACHERS VOICES ABOUT THEY CAN'T WAIT TO GET BACK WITH THEIR STUDENTS. AND MANY OF THEM WERE ENROLLING IN TEACHER PREPARATION AND LOOKING FOR WAYS IN SO I THINK THE SITUATION. IS DEFINITELY HALF FULL AND HALF EMPTY FROM PERSPECTIVE. I THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER APPRECIATE IN. I GUESS IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER. THAT BECOME STATUS I YOU'RE RIGHT THEN THANK FOR THAT ANSWER. FROM A DATA EXTRA. HER FOR T. UP THE NEXT ITEM WHICH IS SOME OF THE SAME PANELISTS ON TEACHER RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. AND THANK LET ME THANK THE PREVIOUS PANEL BUT WE'RE ABOUT TO SEE THEM AGAIN IN THIS PANEL. THOUGH SO THIS TIME WE HAVE KIMBERLY LEAHY AGAIN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DR SANDY AGAIN FROM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COMMISSION ONLY GARNER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND WE'RE ADDING AMY LEE FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO LET'S BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD MORNING KIMBERLY LEAHY. ARMINA FINANCE. THE DEMANDS ON TEACHERS DURING THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAVE BEEN INTENSE AND PRESIDENT LEADING TO CHANGES THAT HAVE EXACERBATED EXISTING EDUCATION EDUCATOR SHORTAGES. THE PANDEMIC HAS ACCELERATED RETIREMENTS AND REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS WELL ONE CREASING THE NUMBER TEACHER SERVING ON AN EMERGENCY CREDENTIAL. YES ITS URGING TO HEAR ANECDOTALLY THAT THE PIPELINE DOES SEEM TO STILL BE STRONG AND AT NEW CANDIDATES ARE ENROLLING IN PREPARATION PROGRAMS IT MINISTRATION ESTIMATED TRUMP CREASING THE NUMBER OF WELL PREPARED TEACHERS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM WELL PREPARED EDUCATOR WORKFORCE IS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR SHE RUNS. AND IN CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. THIS ESPECIALLY POST PENSION AS STUDENTS DEAL WITH THE LONG TERM. IMPACT BUT NINETY. GIVEN THESE CHALLENGES TOGETHER BUDGET INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO IMPROVE THE STATE'S TEACHER PIPELINE. THIS INCLUDES ONE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR THE TEACHER RESIDENCY GRANTS PROGRAM TO ESTABLISH NEW OR EXPANDING EXISTING TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAMS AND DESIGNATED SHORTAGE DEALS ALLEN TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND BUDGET CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEE TEACHER CREDENTIAL PROGRAM JUST SUPPORT AT LEAST ONE THOUSAND FORTY ONE. CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. AREN'T TEACHING CREDENTIAL. OF THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION PROVIDED FOR THE TEACHER RESIDENCY GRANT STEP TO FIVE MILLION IS AVAILABLE BURKE CASSIDY GRANTS TO SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT APPLICATIONS FOR A TEACHER RESIDENCY GRANT. BUT THESE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN WELL RECEIVED BY LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES AND HOW ARE SIGNIFICANT UNMET DEMAND. RATE THAT I'M HAPPY TO PASS THIS JUNE VERY STAND I'M SURE SHE HAS MORE TO SAY ON TALKS GRAYSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELCOME BACK DR CINDY. THANK YOU SO MUCH OF THIS IS THIS IS EXCITING WORK THAT WE'VE OF BEEN GRATEFUL TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE HAS INVESTED MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PATHWAYS AND THE AND THE SUPPORT FOR CANDIDATES COMING INTO TEACHING AND THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN IN FACT I SUSPECT- AND PROBABLY SHOULD PROVE THREE SOME REASONABLE DATA COLLECTION THAT. THE INCREASED ENROLLMENTS WERE SEEN THIS YEAR ARE DUE IN PART TO THE STIMULATION THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED THUS FAR BY THREE STATE INVESTMENT. SOME OF THOSE INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN IN INFRASTRUCTURE- THERE WAS FOR INSTANCE THERE'S TEN MILLION DOLLARS SET ASIDE TO DEVELOP UNDERGRADUATE PATHWAYS WE ISSUE FORTY ONE GRANTS TO INSTITUTIONS THAT CREATED. EIGHTY OR SO DIFFERENT UNDERGRADUATE PATHWAYS FOR SOMEONE TO START AS A FRESHMAN IN COLLEGE COMPLETE THEIR DEGREE UNDER CREDENTIAL WITHIN FOUR OR FOUR AND A HALF YEARS AND MOVE INTO TEACHING- THAT WAS AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM. AND NOW WE NEED TO DO IS RECRUIT INTO THOSE PROGRAMS TO MAKE OF THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER RATHER AVAILABLE TO CANDIDATES LIKE TO DO THAT KIND OF FAST TRACK UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM TO GET IT DONE. I SEE RESIDENCY PROGRAM ALSO AS AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM WE'RE BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES TO PARTNER WITH A HIGHER EDUCATION TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAM AND MOVE THAT PROGRAM TO THEIR CAMPUS THE SERVER JUST GOOD TEACHER RESIDENCY IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT WORK COURSES ARE OFFERED TO THEIR TEACHERS. ON CAMPUS ON THE AT THE SCHOOL CAMPUS OF THE WITHIN THE L. EA WITH OCCASIONAL FORCES BACK AT THE UNIVERSITY OF THE INSTITUTION. AND THEIR LOCAL THE STRICT. BONDED SIGNIFICANT TO A- TO GROW THEIR OWN TO THROUGH REST. AND THESE OF THE PROVIDE THE SECOND SET OF HERE OF THE T. NEEDS TO GET A FULL YEAR IN A IN PREPARATION WITH VETERANS. WILL LEARN THEIR CRAFT. THEY'RE AVAILABLE TO SUBSTITUTE IF THEY GET A SUBSTITUTE TEACHING CREDENTIAL SOME OF THEM MAY EVEN SERVICE FOR PROFESSIONALS TO PROVIDE CERTAIN KINDS OF SUPPORT SYSTEMS. WITHIN WITHIN THE SYSTEMS OF EDUCATION. RESIDENCY PROGRAM IS A LONG TERM INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE ALSO THE DEVELOPMENT OF TEACHERS ON OUR END AND ELLIE A CAPACITY TO DEVELOPING GROW AND PARTNER. IN THE GROWTH OF THEIR OF THEIR TEACHER FORCED THE CLASSIFIED GRANT TO SPEND AN INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. HI RECRUITING LOCALLY PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN WORKING IN THE SCHOOLS ALONGSIDE TEACHERS FOR MANY YEARS WHO HAVE COMPLETED SOME AMOUNT OF HIGHER EDUCATION TOWARD A CREDENTIAL. THIS PROGRAM PUTS HIM ON TRACK TO GET ALL THE WAY TO THE FINISH LINE TO BECOME TEACHERS WITHIN THE DISTRICT- THESE ARE IMPORTANT INVESTMENTS IN THIS IS NOT. I WOULD SAY A TIME TO REDUCE OUR FOCUS OUR ENERGY. AROUND THIS EFFORT TO BUILD OUR CAPACITY TO DEVELOP TEACHERS AND TO SPEND THE MONEY NECESSARY TO RECRUIT THEM- SO WE'RE VERY ENCOURAGED BY. THE ADMINISTRATION'S INVESTMENT THIS YEAR- TO CONTINUE THE RESIDENTS WHO WORK WE ARE LOOKING AT A FIVE YEAR WINDOW TO FULLY DISTRIBUTE THAT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR RESIDENCIES. AND TO HELP AT LEAST BUILD THEIR CAPACITY TO WORK WITH THEIR HIRING PARTNERS. GET THAT DONE- AND SIMILARLY I THINK- THAT THE CLASSIFIED GRANT PROGRAM HAS BEEN VERY POPULAR IN THE ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS I THINK WILL BE WELL SPENT. TO RECRUIT MORE TEACHERS. WE SUPPORT SUPPORT. ADMINISTRATIONS WAS. THANK YOU- THEN WE'LL GO TO. OUR DAILY GARNER FOR THE OF THE- THANK YOU CHAIR GARNER BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF MANY OF THE TEACHER RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION PROGRAMS THAT ARE ADMINISTERED THROUGH CTC ARM ARE HIGHLY SUPPORTED BY THE S. P. I. N. C. E. INVESTMENTS IN OUR TEACHERS AN EDUCATED WORK FORCE. WE RECOGNIZE THAT YOU ARE VITAL TO CLOSING THE OPPORTUNITY GAP AND WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN OUR BEST AND BRIGHTEST TEACHERS SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON GETTING MALES OF TEACHERS MALE TEACHERS OF COLOR IN THE CLASSROOM AND TEACHERS IN THE FIELD OF SCIENCE MATH AND SPECIAL EDUCATION. EARLY RESEARCH SHOWS THAT TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAMS HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED THE PROPORTION OF TEACHER CANDIDATES OF COLOR WHEN COMPARED TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE FOR TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS TEACHERS PREPARED IN A RESIDENCY PROGRAM STATE OR ARE RETAINED AT THEIR SCHOOLS AND IN A TEACHING PROGRAM AT HIGHER RATES. PARTICULARLY IN SCHOOLS WITH HISTORICALLY HIGH TEACHER TURNOVER RATES WE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THIS POINT AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THEN WILL MOVE TO AMY LEE OF THE- COLONIAL. GOOD MORNING SENATORS IMMEDIATELY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. ON THE GOVERNOR'S TEACHER RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION PROPOSALS MONEY TO SHARE OUR ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS. I'M STARTING WITH A TEACHER RESIDENCY GRANTS THAT GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO PROVIDE ONE HUNDRED MILLION PROP NINETY EIGHT FOR ADDITIONAL GRANTS TO. ESTABLISH NEW AND EXPAND EXISTING TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. JUST AS A QUICK REMINDER TEACHER RESIDENCIES BORROW FROM THE MEDICAL RESIDENCY MODEL WHERE TEACHER CANDIDATES TEACH ALONGSIDE A MENTOR TEACHER. FOR AT LEAST ONE HALF OF THE TIME WHILE PURSUING COURSE WORK. ON THE LEGISLATURE FIRST ESTABLISH A TEACHER RESIDENCY GRANT PROGRAM IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN I SAT. IN OUR ASSESSMENT WE FOUND TO BE TEACHER RESIDENCY GRANT ART DID YOU RESIDENTS THE MODEL TO. IMPROVE TEACHER PREPARATION. BUT IT CAN BE CHALLENGING TO INITIATE AND SUSTAIN. FOR INSTANCE THAT DISTRICTS THAT WE SPOKE TO MENTIONED ISSUES ESTABLISHING A RELIABLE PARTNERSHIP. WITH THE UNIVERSITY PROVIDING THE COURSE WORK. I'M ATTRACTING RESIDENTS TO THE PROGRAM AND FIND FINDING SUSTAINABLE FINDING AFTER THEIR GRANDPARENTS. ADDITIONALLY CDC WAS ONLY ABLE TO AWARD TWENTY SEVEN MILLION OUT OF THE FIFTY MILLION. INITIALLY ALLOCATED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. DUE TO THESE REASONS WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED A- REDUCED AMOUNT OF FIFTY MILLION FOR THE TEACHER RESIDENCY GRANTS. REFLECTING THEM OUT AT TTC HAS BEEN ABLE TO WORK TO DATE. AND THE LIKE THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PROGRAMS THAT MIGHT DAMPEN INTEREST. FOR THE CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEE TEACHING CREDENTIAL PROGRAM OR THE CLASSIFIED PROGRAMS- THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO PROVIDE TWENTY FIVE MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FOR ADDITIONAL GRANTS TO SUPPORT. CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEES SUCH AS- TEACHERS AIDS. MUST DRIVERS CAFETERIA WORKERS- CREDENTIAL ALL DOUBLE PARTICIPATE K. RECEIVE UP FIFTY FOURTHS OVER YEARS UNDER THE PER. WE FOUND THAT THE CLASSIFIED PROGRAM IS IN HIGH DEMAND AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY SEVEN APPLICANTS APPLICATIONS FROM DISTRICTS AND% COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION WERE UNDERFUNDED FROM THE FIRST TWO ROUNDS OF FUNDING. SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR SEEMS SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROGRAM AND CONSIDER IT A LONG TERM GROW YOUR OWN RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION STRATEGY. HOWEVER THE CLASSIFIED PROGRAM DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE TARGETED TO SCHOOLS MOST AFFECTED BY TEACHER SHORTAGES. AND OUR ANALYSIS WE FOUND THAT OF DAY TWENTY THREE DISTRICTS THAT APPLIED INDIVIDUALLY SEVEN HAD LOWER SHARES OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS. AND TEACHERS ON EMERGENCY CREDENTIALS COMPARED TO STATEWIDE AVERAGES WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED A PROPOSED TWENTY FIVE MILLION AUGMENTATION TO THE CLASSIFIED PROGRAMS. ALSO INCLUDE CHANGES TO PRIORITIZE AND TARGET SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE MOST AFFECTED BY TEACHER SHORTAGES AND THIS INCLUDES- THOSE WITH HIGHER SHARES OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ON EMERGENCY CREDENTIALS. THIS IS JUST CONSISTENT WITH HOW THE STATE TARGETS OTHER TEACHER WORKFORCE INITIATIVES WITH THAT I'LL CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR CALL. AND UNWANTED GET BACK TO ONE YOUR COMMENTS BUT BUT FIRST. OUR OUR I WAS HOPING SOMEBODY AND I DON'T KNOW WHO THE RIGHT PERSON IS TO ASK. COULD STAND BACK FROM THESE INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS. ENTELLUS WHAT THE PACE OF RETIREMENTS IS BEEN IN THE LAST FEW YEARS VERSUS THE NEED FOR NEW TEACHERS. AND WHETHER THERE'S A SHORTAGE THAT IS COMING FROM THAT AND LOOKING AHEAD TO MAYBE THE TEACHERS THAT ARE WRITTEN THE RETIREMENT AGE FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS. WHAT THAT MEANS ABOUT THE ABILITY OF US HAVING ENOUGH TEACHERS TO COME IN BEHIND THEM BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THESE INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS THEY'RE GOOD AND WE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND FULLY WHAT THE OVERALL. SITUATION IS OF WHETHER WE HAVE A SHORTAGE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE RETIRING AT A MUCH FASTER RATE THAN NEW TEACHERS ARE COMING AND- I JUST DIDN'T GET A SENSE OF THAT FROM THE- OF THE INFORMATION I DON'T KNOW WHO WANTS TO TAKE THAT FIRST SHOULD I. START WITH DOCTOR SANDY AND THEN SEE ABOUT EITHER THE L. A. O. OR- FOR FINANCE. YES THANK YOU- THE ELITE SO THE COMMISSION DOES% NOT KEEP TRACK OF REQUIREMENTS PERCENT- WE HAVE DATA IN A IN A REPORT SOMEWHEREAND I CERTAINLY CAN GET THIS YEAR THAT INDICATES THE AGE RANGES- IN WHICH THE CURRENT POPULATION ALL OF WHICH COULD BE AN INDICATOR OF YOU KNOW WHEN TO BEGIN TO PREDICT REQUIREMENTS BUT I DON'T HAVE GOOD DATA AND MAYBE I SHOULD ASK EITHER. FINANCES THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FOR THE ELDERLY- IF ANY OF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO SPEAK TO THAT QUESTION. CHANNEL AIRED LIKE HONOR ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT UNFORTUNATELY CD DOESN'T COLLECT THAT IF THAT INFORMATION BUT I BELIEVE THAT CAL SISTERS. MAY HAVE THAT INFORMATION SO EIGHT I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO GO TO A DIFFERENT AGENCY FOR THAT INFO OKAY BUT YOU SEE IT'S REALLY HARD. TO CONSIDER ALL THE TEACHER TRAINING PROGRAMS AND ASSESS THE RETIREMENTS THAT ARE POINTED OUT HERE THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY HAPPENING DURING COLD FOOD. AGAINST WHAT THE NEED IS AND WHETHER WE'RE FALLING SHORT AND IT. AND WHILE I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THESE. ON THE FACE OF IT FOR WHAT THEY ARE WHICH IS WHICH IS OVERALL GOOD. IT WOULD BE NICE TO KNOW BEFORE MISSING A TARGET FOR WHAT WE REALLY NEED FOR TEACHERS AND WHETHER WE SHOULD BE AIMING SOME OF THESE EFFORTS NUMERICALLY TO THAT DOESN'T TELL US. WHETHER THESE NUMBERS ARE VALUABLE AGAINST WHAT THE OVERALL TRENDS ARE- AND LET ME. ASK AND I DON'T KNOW. WHETHER IT'S FINANCE OR THE COMMISSION WHEN THAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST SAYS THAT OF THE CLASSIFIED PROGRAMS IN HIGH DEMAND BUT IS NOT TARGETED TO THE AREAS WHERE THERE ARE SHORTAGES DO EITHER OF YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO THAT. I CAN START AND SAY THAT THAT WASN'T IT WASN'T. THAT'S NEVER BEEN ONE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE- OF THAT PROGRAM. THE TARGET SO. SELFISH ELIGIBILITY FOR THE GRASS BASED ON THE ELIGIBILITY DETERMINED BY THE LEGISLATURE WINNING THE PEACE FUNDS IN MOTION. THIRD I GUESSED THAT THE OUR WAY OF SAYING IT WOULD REALLY BE DESIRABLE TO TARGETED TO THE AREAS THAT ARE UNDERSERVED EVEN A. N. THE L. A. O. ARE YOU REALLY SUGGESTING THAT SINCE THIS ISN'T ON THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD ACTUALLY CONSIDER AS A POLICY MATTER. ADDING THAT AS A THING WHERE WHERE IT WOULD BE TARGETED TO THE UNDERSERVED AREAS. YES SENATOR THAT IS OUR RECOMMENDATION TO ADD YOUR LANGUAGE THAT WOULD PRIORITIZE DISTRICTS THAT ARE MOST AFFECTED BY SCHOOL DE SORRY TEACHER SHORTAGES. KERN IF THEY'RE GONNA GO BACK TO EITHER FINANCE OR FOR DOCTOR SANDY IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO DO THAT. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE HARDFOR YOU TO IMPLEMENT. WELL I DON'T IT'S NOT CHALLENGING TO IMPLEMENT THAT WE SIMPLY PUT THAT IN THE GRANT CONDITIONS FOR RATIFICATION AND THAT WILL LIMIT THE POOL OF WHO APPLIES. TO RECEIVE THESE GRANTS I DO WONDER HOWEVER WHETHER THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME TO DO THAT- IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ANY OF US YET WHAT RETIREMENTS ARE GOING TO BE LIKE THIS YEAR BASED ON CO. WE HEAR ABOUT IT IN THE WAY IN FACT WE DON'T I HAVEN'T WE DON'T WE WON'T KNOW OF. UNTIL FOR A FEW MONTHS YET. HOW MANY TEACHERS DECIDE THAT. THEY'RE GONNA RETIRED THIS YEAR BASED ON CODE BASED ON ANY NUMBER OF OTHER CONDITIONS SO IT'S CHALLENGING AT THE MOMENT TO KNOW WHERE THE AREAS OF NEED ARE GOING TO BE- IS AS WE MOVE FORWARD I THINK THOUGH THAT WHAT'S BEING POINTED OUT. IS THAT. IT IS NOT MEETING A DEMAND FOR THE SHORTAGES ARE AND I THINK THAT WHEN YOU DO THIS. YOU DON'T PRECLUDE THE OTHERS FROM APPLYING AND PRECLUDE THE OTHERS FROM BEING FUNDED IT IS. IT IS JUST THAT YOU TRY TO GO TO WHERE THE NEED IS AND THEN. IF THE APPLICATIONS ARE ONLY FROM AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE UNDERSERVED AND DID YOU. YOU SUCCESSFULLY RANKED THOSE APPLICATIONS AND MOVE IT OUT THE DOOR I DON'T THINK IT'S- IT WAS A SUGGESTION THAT IT BE. EXCLUDED THE OTHERS IT'S JUST IF THERE ARE. ARE HIGH NEEDS AND- IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THE DATA CHANGES YEAR TO YEAR THAT IS ACTUALLY RELATES TO MY PREVIOUS QUESTION WHICH IS IT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD TO HAVE A SENSE OF THE TRENDS BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO EFFECTIVELY. RESPOND TO THE TREND SENATE. EVERYBODY WAS POINTING TO ANOTHER AGENCY THAT IS NOT HERE BUT- BUT YOU'RE THE ONES ADDED MINISTERTHE TH THE PROGRAMS THAT. ARE SUPPOSED TO ADDRESS THE TRENDS SO IT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD TO KNOW. THAT IF THERE'S A SHORTAGE WE ARE REALLY ADDRESSING WHERE THE SHORTAGES. AND NOT JUST FIGURING MARC THIS IS GOOD AND WE'RE JUST GONNA DO THIS AND THERE'S BOUND TO BE A SHORTAGE SO WE NEED TO DO IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE SOME. SOME DATA THAT THAT SORT OF. COULD ADDRESS THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL SURE- AND WE COLLECT AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION COLLECTS ANNUALLY IN THE FALL OF PROJECTED HIRES FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR. AND WE DO REPORT THAT IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY REPORT EVERY YEAR- SO IT'S A PROJECTION. AND YOU KNOW AS OUR DATA SYSTEMS GET BETTER WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PROJECTION WAS ACCURATE OR NOT. BUT THE PROJECTIONS WE SEE FOR HIRING AROUND TWENTY THOUSAND WERE PROJECTED FOR THE NINETEEN TWENTY- ACADEMIC YEAR AS NEEDED TO BE HIRED. BY DISTRICTS REPORTED THIS ABOUT 30% OF THOSE REFER MULTIPLE SUBJECT TEACHERS WHO WORK PRIMARILY INDICATE ENVIRONMENT. OF ABOUT- ENGLISH A SINGLE SUBJECT AREAS. THAT 7% ACROSS THE SCIENCES- THAT'S MORE OR LESS HOW THE% BREAKDOWNS WERE FOR THE NUMBERS OF TEACHERS ACROSS DIFFERENT CREDENTIAL. TYPES IF THAT'S HELPFUL BUT I THINK THE STATE DOES NEED TO GET BETTER AND WE'D LIKE TO GET BETTER AT PROJECTING. A DEMAND. WELL WE CAN TELL YOU A LOT ABOUT WHO'S COMING INTO PREPARATION- AND PEOPLE COME IN AND OUT OF TEACHING OF FOR A WHOLE VARIETY OF REASONS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN PART OF THE SCOPE OF OUR STUDY. WE WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT KIND OF DATA COLLECTION IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. MISTER MILLER I WAS JUST ABOUT TO RECOGNIZE YOU BECAUSE YOUR HAND TO STOP. SO THANK THANK YOU FOR. HE RICK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I HAVE A OF COMMENTS ON THE EAST. ARE RESIDENTS AND- CLASSIFIED BROKE. I'D LIKE JUST FIRST WITH THE RED. SINCE OUR FARTHER BACK WILL THAT OUT OF WAY BUT- LAST YEAR. THE COMMISSION WAS ONLY TO ALLOCATE TWENTY SEVEN. OF THE- MONEY THAT HAD BEEN PROVIDED FOR THAT PROGRAM. AND THAT'S NOT DUE TO A LACK OF DEMAND FOR THE PROGRAM OR A LACK OF. EFFORT ON THE PART OF THE COMMISSION- HE OF HOPE AND BUDGET CONCERNS THE MONEY FOR THE PROGRAM WAS SWEPT. JUSTICE THEY WERE ABOUT TO ALLOCATE ADDITIONAL GRANTS AND SO THERE IS ALREADY WAITING APPLICATIONS TO BE BURNED. OUT FOR THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM SO I. I HAVE SOME CONCERN ABOUT. CUTTING THE PROPOSAL. TO BE LESS THAN A HUNDRED MILLION THAT IT WEEK INCLUDED IN THAT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SO IT JUST. BUT IT SHOULD BE THAT PROGRAM ON THAT NOTE. AND THEN LIVING ACTUALLY. CLASSIFIED PROGRAM. WE'RE OPEN TO. ABOUT ADJUSTING REQUIRE. FOR ELLIS IN THE PROGRAM- BUT I WOULD LIKE TO. KIND OF RAISED THE- IDEA TO THINK ABOUT IT WE BASED ELIGIBILITY ON LET'S SAY EXAMPLE EMERGENCYPERMITS OR WAIVERS YOU SHOULD KEEP IN MIND. THAT THOSE TYPES OF- LICENSORS FOR TEACHERS TO PROVIDE CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION ARE TEMPORARY THEY CAN ONLY BE ISSUED WARRANTS AND THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE THIS LOADING NUMBER SO A SCHOOL MAY HOW MANY OF THOSE ONE YEAR. AND HAVE YOU WORKED IN NEXT YEAR AND THAT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND THAT- DATE DATE COULD BE ELIGIBLE ONE YEAR AND THEN NOT ELIGIBLE FOR NEXT YEAR SO IT'S- LIKE I SAID WE'RE OPEN TO A CONVERSATION AROUND THAT BUT WE NEED TO DEFINITELY. WORK WITH THE COMMISSION ON THE DETAILS OF HOW THAT WOULD STRONG SHOWING WORK IN IMPLEMENTATION. THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO ASK THANK YOU THANK YOU I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER RAISED HANDS ON THAT SO LET ME ASK A CENTER MENIFEE HAS ANY QUESTIONS. YEAH I JUST WANTED TO REVISIT THAT RESIDENCY PROGRAM- ACCORDINGLY- REPORT THESE PROGRAMS HAVE HIGH COSTS ARE HIGH START UP COSTS. IT'S I GUESS MY QUESTION IS YOU KNOW WE ARE PROJECTING OUT IF I'M RECALLING. CORRECTLY I. SHORTFALLS IN THE BUDGET IN THE SUBSEQUENT YEARS OF THIS THIS- SURPLUS THAT WE'RE SEEING THIS YEAR. IT REALLY IS A ONE TIME SURPLUS IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. WILL BE ONES WERE FACING MORE CHALLENGES. GIVEN THAT THESE PROGRAMS COST SO MUCH TO SET UP DOES IT MAKE MORE SENSE TO ALLOCATE OUT. SOME OF THESE FUNDS OVER THREE FOUR YEARS PERHAPS OR- TO DO SOMETHING OTHER THAN COMMITTED AS ONE TIME. ONE YEAR FUNDING. YEP THIS IS KEN LAY HERE AGAIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. D. THE PROPOSAL FOR THE TEACHER RESIDENCY GRANT PROGRAM- IS SPREAD OUT OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD SO IT'S ONE TIME FUNDING ONE HUNDRED MILLION BUT IT'S AVAILABLE OVER FIVE YEARS. SO THE THOUGHT WOULD BE THAT INITIALLY THE COMMISSION WOULD BE ABLE TO SATISFY EXISTING APPLICATIONS AND THEN PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THOSE PROGRAMS OVER THE PERIOD OF THE- GRANT. PERIOD AND THEN- THE SECOND YEAR THE MORE GRANTS WOULD BE A SATISFIED SO I'M I CAN LEAVE THE DETAILS OF. OF THE DEMAND AND THE GRANT APPLICATIONS- TO THE COMMISSION THANK YOU. OKAY ANY OTHER COMMENT BEFORE WE MOVE ON THERE THANK YOU. THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR MEN- WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. A WHICH IS THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER PROGRAM AND I THINK SOME OF OUR PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS REFLECT ON ISSUES HERE. IN THE PANEL'S GABRIELA CHAVEZ OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JAKE BREMNER FROM THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION ELLIE GARNER AGAIN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND AMY WE AGAIN FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WILL GO IN THAT ORDER MORE HOLD QUESTIONS TO AFTER ALL FOR PRESENTED AND WE'LL START WITH GABRIELA CHILDERS. THE MORNING TRAIN MEMBERS W. LIKE CHáVEZ WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I WILL GIVE MY COME SHORT. AS THE AGENT I STATES THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. IS FOR THE GOLDEN STATE FUTURE GRANT PROGRAM. WHICH PROVIDES SUPPORT PROGRAMS TO STUDENTS ENROLLED IN TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS HUCAL NEED TO WORKING IN THE HIGH NEED FEEL. I JUST COASTLINES WITH THE HIGHEST RATED ANON CREDENTIAL OR WAIT FEATURES I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE TO CHECK FROM HER FROM THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND- SENATOR MEN- VERY GOOD TO BE WITH YOU TODAY JAKE BRUNNER DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AND EXTERNAL RELATIONS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND HAPPY TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM TODAY AND REJOIN YOU ON WEDNESDAY FOR OTHER STUDENT AID COMMISSION BUDGET PROPOSALS AND OTHER ITEMS. THIS TO ME COMMISSION WELCOMES THIS PROPOSED NEW INVESTMENT IN THE GOLD STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AND ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE COMMISSION IS BEEN GRATEFUL FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO INITIATE THIS NEW FORM OF SUPPORT FOR INSPIRING EDUCATORS AND CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS EXPANDING OUR TEACHER WORKFORCE PIPELINE IN CALIFORNIA. AS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA MATERIALS THERE WAS REDIRECTION OF STATE FUNDING INITIALLY ALLOCATED TOWARDS THE PROGRAM AND IN TWENTY TWENTY AN ALLOCATION OF FEDERAL I. D. E. A. FUNDING- INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT FUNDING THAT THIS TO MAKE COMMISSION- WAS- ALLOCATED TO SHIP DURING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM TO FOCUS ON SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. AS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA MATERIALS AGAIN THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION HAS RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY APPLICATIONS FROM STUDENTS- THUS FAR INDICATING THAT THEY WILL PURSUE. A CREDENTIAL AND SPECIAL EDUCATION. THE COMMISSION IS IN THE OF. AND VALIDATING THE APPLICANT SPECIAL EDUCATION CREDENTIALS WITH THEIR INSTITUTIONS AND THEN OBTAINING THE TEACHING AGREEMENTS FROM ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. ANTICIPATE THAT THIS PROCESS WILL CONCLUDE IN THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO. HOWEVER THE COMMISSION IS NOT YET ABLE TO DISPERSE AWARDS- JUDY'S ELIGIBLE STUDENT APPLICANTS AS WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR FINAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF AN INTER AGENCY AGREEMENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- DUE TO THE NATURE OF THESE FEDERAL FUNDS THROUGH THE ID A PROGRAM. ONCE THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN SIGNED OFF BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION CAN BEGIN TO CERTIFY STUDENT APPLICATIONS AND DISBURSE FUNDS TO THEIR INSTITUTIONS. WE DO- BELIEVE THAT WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE APPLICATIONS THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR BUT- ESTIMATE THAT IT IS UNLIKELY WE WOULD EXTINGUISH THE ENTIRE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION THAT WAS PROVIDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE STATE BUDGET. THE REMAINING FUNDS WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR ADDITIONAL WARDS IN THE UPCOMING YEAR AND I'M HAPPY TO SPEAK TO THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE FUNDS IF- YOU SHOULD HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THAT SENATOR BUT ALL ALL KEEP MY COMMENTS THERE FOR NOW. THANK YOU IT IS THE POSTER BEHIND YOU ABOUT A DEER OR ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH AMY LEE FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. IF YOU'RE A NEARLY FROM L. A. L. AGAIN WE WANTED TO SHARE OUR ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATION ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE ONE HUNDRED MILLION NONPROFIT NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR. ADDITIONAL GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANTS. AT THIS TIME THE FIRST ROUND OF T. GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN AWARDED WHICH% MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO MEASURE THE EFFECT OF THIS PROGRAM ON TEACHER SUPPLY. FOR THIS REASON WE CONSIDER AN ADDITIONAL ROUND OF FUNDING TO BE SOMEWHAT PREMATURE. FURTHERMORE THE IMPACT OF THIS PROGRAM ON A DRESSING RECRUITMENT CHALLENGES THAT LOW INCOME SCHOOLS MAY EXPERIENCE. MAY BE LIMITED. FIRST THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT A TEACHER CANDIDATE WILL ULTIMATELY TEACH AT A LOW INCOME SCHOOL OR BE ABLE TO PAY BACK GRANT FUNDING IF THEY ARE UNABLE TO MEET THE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS. AND SUCH FACTORS MAY SIMPLY BE OUT OF A TEACHER'S CONTROL. FURTHERMORE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS FINDING AS A RECRUITMENT INCENTIVE IS ALOLIMITED SINCE SOME TEACHERS WOULD HAVE TAUGHT AT A LOW INCOME SCHOOL EVEN WITHOUT THE GRANT. LAST WEEK SCHOOLS TARGETED UNDER THIS PROPOSAL HAVE RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT FUNDING FROM THE TO FEDERAL COPY NINETEEN RELIEF PACKAGES TOTALING. SEVEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS GIVEN THE FLEXIBILITY OVER THESE FEDERAL FUNDS AS SCHOOLS HAVE A BROAD RANGE OF OPTIONS TO. HIRE AND RETAIN QUALIFIED AND PREPARED TO TEACHERS INCLUDING TEACHERS SERVICE AWARD SIGNING BONUSES OR STUDENT DEBT PAYMENTS. HE'S A PURCHASE MAYBE IT MORE RESPONSIVE TO LOCAL NEEDS AND GOALS AND SEAT TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM. FOR THESE REASONS WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECTS THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROPOSAL. SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE BE INTERESTED IN AND SANTA FUNDING FOR TEACHERS HOWEVER WE SUGGEST FOCUSING EFFORTS ON EXPANDING THE TOTAL SUPPLY OF TEACHERS IN SHORTAGE AREAS. FOR INSTANCE THE LEGISLATURE COULD INSTEAD CONSIDER FOR TARGETING FUNING TO EXPAND AND WILL MAKE IN THE INTEGRATED TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS AT THE UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL WHICH DOCTOR CD MENTIONED EARLIER- ANY OTHER SEATS CURRENTLY OFFERED THIS ROUTE INTO TEACHING. UNDER THIS APPROACH THE STATE COULD INCREASE THAT TOTAL SUPPLY TEACHERS BY ENCOURAGING. MORE MORE UNDERGRADUATE. STUDENTS TO PURSUE TEACHING AND A HIGH I NEED SUBJECT YOUR YES WHEN THE OTHER. MIGHT MADE AFTER OTHER. PROFESSIONS BUT THAT HAPPY TO HAVE. CONCLUDE MY THERE AND YES ANY QUESTION THINK. THANK YOU ARM. LET ME JUST ASK OUR AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT SHOULD BE FINANCER THE- PEOPLE WHO WANT pWHO WANTS TO RESPOND TO THE COMMENTS THAT WERE JUST MADE BY THE L. A- ABOUT THIS. I LIKE HONOR THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT I'D LIKE TO MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT ACTUALLY. AB EIGHT I WOULD SAY THE CALIFORNIA'S IN THE MIDST OF A SEVERE AND DEEPENING SHORTAGE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS AND THE FIELD OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AT LARGE HAS LONG BEEN PLAGUED BY PERSISTENT SHORTAGES A FULLY CERTIFIED TEACHERS. IN LARGE PART DUE TO A SEVERE DROP IN TEACHER EDUCATION ROMANS AND HYDRATION FOR SPECIAL EDUCATORS- AS A RESULT STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WHO HAVE THE GREATEST NEEDS ARE FREQUENTLY TAUGHT BY LEAST QUALIFIED TEACHERS. AND PART OF THIS- THIS PROGRAM DOES ADDRESS THAT IN SPACE AND SPECIFICITY THE INTER AGENCY AGREEMENT BETWEEN CD- SPECIFICALLY THE SPECIAL EDUCATION VISION AND THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION. IS REQUIRED AS A RESULT OF SB ONE SIXTEEN FROM THE TWENTY TWENTIES BUDGET ACT- AND THAT FIFTY NINE DOLLARS IS FOR DEALING WITH THESE SPECIFIC THINGS IN IN ADDITION- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS DOES PROVIDE A HIGHLIGHT AND CALM AND A SPECIAL. A ON THE ISSUE AND SO IT IS IMPORTANT PIECE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS ON THIS. MISTER CHAIR IF I MAY I WILL USE IT- SIMILAR TO OTHER OF TEACHING GRANT PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERED RECIPIENTS OF THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM AWARDS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT VERIFICATION OF EVERY YEAR THAT THEY THOUGHT I DON'T FORGET IT SCHOOL AND- THIS TO MAKE COMMISSION WILL NEED TO. VERIFY THAT THEY HAVE COMPLETED THOSE FOR ALL FOUR YEARS I'M A VERIFICATION AND THERE IS ALSO IN THE DOCUMENTATION THAT STUDENTS- SIGN IN THE IN THE PROCESS OF RECEIVING THEIR AWARD- REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY COMPLY WITH THE TEACHING REQUIREMENT AND THAT THEY ALSO AGREED TO REPAYMENT OBLIGATIONS SHOULD BE NOT MEET THAT REQUIREMENT- WE WILL- BECAUSE WE'VE NOT YET PAID OUT ANY RECIPIENTS OF THIS PROGRAM THE STUDENTS THAT WILL START TO COLLECT VERIFICATION FORMS FROM STUDENTS WOULD LIKELY BE MAY. OF TWENTY TWO AND THEN WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE- FURTHER DATA AND INFORMATION JUNE CHáVEZ CANADIAN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES AROUND THE COMPLETION RATES OF- PARTICIPANTS. IN THEIR TEACHING REQUIRED. OUR AND AN- ARM AND ASK. INNER MOMENT OF SAN MEANT ANY. BUT MAYBE TO RISK TO THAT. A WITH A COMMON WAS GOING TO MAKE IN CLOSING ON THIS ITEM. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEY'RE JUST A LOT OF MOVING PIECES TO THIS. AND WHO ARE STAFF WILL WORK. ON WHATEVER DATA BECOMES AVAILABLE BY THE TIME WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION ON THIS TO SEE IF IT INFORMS IT UP OR DOWN BECAUSE- LAST YEAR WAS SWEPT. NEXT YEAR IT'S BACK BUT SOME OF IT IS ONE TIME OTHERS A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER. A MONEY HAS BEEN LEFT OVER AND I THINK WE'LL WANT TO TIE THAT ALL DOWN IN CONJUNCTION WITH WHATEVER OUR DECISIONS ARE WITH THE MAY REVISE RATHER THAN. THAN ASKED ABOUT I'M HERE BECAUSE THERE ARE THERE MIGHT BE SOME MORE FACTS TO COME INTO EVIDENCE BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS. SO LET ME ASK A- NO QUESTIONS FROM SENATOR MAN SO. LET ME THANK ALL OF YOU ON THAT PANEL WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ISSUE FIVE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS AND- AND- THAT'S A ONCE AGAIN. KIMBERLY LEAHY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ELLIE GARNER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN NAME AWAY FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IN THAT ORDER. LET'S BEGIN WITH KIMBERLY WAY. WHY BACK. EARLY LIKE HE DEPART OF. CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATORS HAVE RISEN TO THE CHALLENGES OF THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC BY DEVELOPING AND DELIVERING CURRICULUM IN A DISTANCE LEARNING OR HYBRID CONTEXT PROVIDING INTENSIVE AND TARGETED IN PERSON INSTRUCTION.

EDUCATORS AND STUDENTS WILL FACE A WIDE RANGE OF CHALLENGES PERCENT RETURN TO IN CLASS INSTRUCTION. IT MINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING EDUCATORS WITH THE TOOLS THEY NEED BUT IN THE SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM TO MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A COMPREHENSIVE THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION DOLLAR PACKAGE FOR EDUCATOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT.

PARTMINER DEDICATION WILL ALLOCATE FUNDING BASED ON THE NUMBER OF FULL TIME EQUIVALENT CLASSROOMS STAFF IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY WHICH WILL FACILITATE A RAPID DISBURSEMENT OF THE OF THE- FUNDS BY THE DEPARTMENT TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. THE EDUCATOR EFFECTIVE BLOCK GRANT WAS WELL RECEIVED BY LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES AND EDUCATORS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN FISCAL YEAR THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ONETIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND WILL ALLOW EDUCATORS TO EITHER SUPPLEMENT OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS WITHIN THE SPECIFIC TOIC AREAS.

WELL THE GOVERNOR'S IS FOR ONE TIME TO FIND THE FRESNO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION HAS SUBMITTED A PLAN THAT WOULD REQUIRE ON GOING FUNDING IF THERE'S A DESIRE TO SATISFY THE UNMET DEMAND FOR THE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE.

I LOST MY PLACE HERE I THINK WE DID THAT YOU'VE DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB OF GOING TO THE BUDGET WE HAVE ALL THAT INFORMATION AND I KNOW YOU GOING THROUGH IT HELPS THE PEOPLE WATCHING AT HOME THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE THE STAFF REPORT. BUT WE'RE STARTING TO RUN LOW ON TIME SO I'LL JUST LEAVE IT IN CASE ANYBODY HAS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AND THEN GO TO ELLIE GARNER OF FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THANK YOU CHAIR. ALI GARNER AGAIN ON BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION THE CITY IS PLATE PLEASED TO SEE THE OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENTS IN OUR TEACHERS AN ADDICT EDUCATOR WORK FORCE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WITH OUR STUDENTS FACING THE CHALLENGES OF THIS PANDEMIC IT IS CRITICAL THAT OUR TEACHERS AND STAFF ARE PREPARED IN THE AREA OF SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING AND TRAUMA INFORMED PRACTICES TO HELP. STUDENTS BOTH EMOTIONALLY AND MENTALLY WE HAVE TWO ISSUES TO NOTE ONE THE CITY APPRECIATES THE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT OF EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION. FOR THE EARLY MATH INITIATIVE PROGRAM THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS NEEDED TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA STUDENTS IN REACHING AND REACHING STATE MATH STANDARDS THESE FUNDS. HAVE BEEN USED TO BUILD EDUCATOR KNOWLEDGE ENTHUSIASM AND COMFORT IN TEACHING MATH. AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE COACHING. AND ONE ON ONE MATH STRATEGIES. AND FUNDING COULD ALLOW THE INITIATIVE TO MAINTAIN AND GROW ITS REACH AND FURTHER IMPROVE STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. THE ADDITIONAL MONEY COULD ALSO SUPPORT ONLINE MODULE DEVELOPMENT FOR ADDITIONAL PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. IN ADDITION TO THE IN PERSON AND ZOOM VIRTUAL TRAINING. THE EARLY MATH INITIATIVE HAS SERVED OVER SEVENTEEN THOUSAND CHILDREN FROM AGES FROM BIRTH TO AGE EIGHT. THROUGH THIRTY DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS AND MORE THAN FOURTEEN HUNDRED EDUCATOR PART AND MORE THAN FOURTEEN HUNDRED EDUCATORS PARTICIPATED IN THE INITIATIVE. OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS 93% SERVE CHILDREN THAT ARE DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS. AND EIGHTY NINE PERCENT. SERVE CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES WHILE THE FORMULA VALUATION AT. DISNEY WHILE THE FORMAL EVALUATION OF THIS PROGRAM HAS NOT BEEN FINALIZED. INITIAL FEEDBACK FROM PARTICIPANTS HAS BEEN HAVE BEEN VERY POSITIVE. THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING SHOULD ALSO SUPPORT STATE LEVEL CAPACITY TO BROADEN THE REACH OF THE EARLY MATH INITIATIVE AMONG THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL AND OTHER PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GAINS. IN PRESCHOOL OUR LEVERAGE AND SUSTAINED IN THE EARLY GRADES. SPECIFICALLY THE L. CD WOULD NOTE THAT THE EARLY MATH INITIATIVE WORKLOAD AT CDP WAS ABSORBED BY THE EARLY LEARNING AND CARE DIVISION. BUT THE STAFF PERSON WHO HAS BEEN THE LEAD ON THIS PROGRAM IS SLATED TO TRANSITION TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES DUE TO THE TRANSITION OF CHILD CARE TO SEE. THE EIGHTY ACCESS. AS A RESULT CDP WOULD NEED AN ADDITIONAL STAFF TO ADMINISTER THIS PROGRAM. IF ADDITIONAL FUNDS ARE PROVIDED IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET. THE ONLY OTHER ITEM THAT WE WOULD NOTE IS THAT THIS THE S. S. P. I. N. C. E. ARE VERY PLEASED. TO SEE THE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. TOWARD PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN SUPPORT. OF ETHNIC STUDIES IN OFFERING NEW AND EXPANDED ETHNIC STUDIES COURSES WE ARE CURRENTLY REVIEWING THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND WE WILL BE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON FINANCE FOR CLARIFICATION. AND POSSIBLE AMENDMENTS. ACT INCLUDES CITIES REMARKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF. EMILY. FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S. IN THE REMOTE ALWAYS. ON THE GOVERNOR COMPRESS DOUBLE PROPOS. WE JUST HAVE SOME GENERAL ISSUES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. FIRST WE CONSIDERED THE GOVERNOR'S BLOCK GRANT APPROACH TO PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO BE REASONABLE. FUNDING CAN BE USED TO COMPENSATE STAFF TIME SPENT ON TRAINING OR OTHER SECEDED COSTS. AT THE BLOCK GRANT ALSO ALLOW SOME FLEXIBILITY OVER THE TRAINING TOPICS AS WELL ALLOWING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO BE TARGETED TO AREAS. THAT WOULD MOST BENEFIT TEACHERS AND OTHER STAFF IN EACH SCHOOL. SECONDLY MOST OF THE TARGETED PROPOSALS ADDRESS SPECIFIC GAPS IN TRAINING. FOR INSTANCE THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION IS DUE TO ADOPT A NEW ETHNIC STUDIES MODEL CURRICULUM BY THE END OF MARCH. THIS IS GUIDANCE IS NEW STATE FUNDED PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SEEMS REASONABLE. OTHER PROPOSALS SEEM TO ADDRESS A LACK OF EXISTING RESOURCES SUCH AS THE EARLY MATH INITIATIVE OR FURTHER PROMOTES LESS LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. I'M SUCH AS THE SEEDS CONTINUED EFFORTS ON THE MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT AND YES ASK. OR IN SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING WE ARE LESS CLEAR HOWEVER AND HOW THE FUNDING FOR THE SUBJECT MATTER PROJECTS WOULD ADDRESS EXISTING GAPS. FOR INSTANCE THAT TWO MILLION PROVIDED TO THE SUBJECT MATTER PROJECTS FOR ETHNIC STUDIES APPEARS DUPLICATIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S OTHER PROPOSAL ON ETHNIC STUDIES. THIRD IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CONTAINS VERY FEW DETAILS ON SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS. FOR IT SINCE THE EARLY MATH INITIATIVE ANSWER THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING PROPOSALS DO NOT SPECIFY THE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD BE SUPPORTED WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING. THAT SUBJECT MATTER PROJECT- PROPOSAL ALSO DOES NOT. CLARIFY HOW THE ONE TIME AUGMENTATION WOULD BE USED DIFFERENTLY THAN THE ON GOING FINDING THEIR PROGRAM CURRENTLY RECEIVES. TO ENSURE THAT FUNDS ARE SPENT AS INTENDED WITH THE DESIRED OUTCOMES WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE CLEAR DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTATIONS TIED TO FUNDING FOR THESE MORE TARGETED PROPOSALS. LASTLY WE JUST NOTE THAT- FUNDS PROVIDED THROUGH THE TEAM FEDERAL COUPLE NINETEEN FEDERAL RELIEF PACKAGES. COULD ALSO BE USED ON PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER HOW THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS COMPLEMENT. BE SIGNS I'M WITHOUT HELPING CLICK MY COMMENTS AND ANSWER ANY QUESTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MUCH- I WAS TO. ASKER RELATED WHAT THE L. A. O. JUST SAID IN ASCOT OF FINANCE WHICH IS IT IS THERE ANY INTENT TO USE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT'S COMING AND TO COMPLEMENT THESE PROGRAMS. LET'S JUST A THEY CAN LAY HE WENT TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO GET MUCH OF THE- FEDERAL FUND THAT FUNDS THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED DUE TO CULTIVATE- ARE BEING USED BY ELLIE ACE FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THEY HAVE MANY NEEDS RIGHT NOW DURING THE SENATE PRESIDENT AT TIMES AND- THAT IS PART OF THE REASON WHY WE ARE. PROPOSING SO MUCH MONEY FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAT- THERE THERE'S ADDITIONAL NEED FOR TEACHER. RADIATION AND TEACHER DEVELOPMENT IN IN THESE AREAS TO SUPPORT. STUDENTS AND DURING THESE TIMES- I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT TO YOU FOR JUST BEFORE YOU GO ON TO THAT COMMENT LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THAT BECAUSE- HE DID NOT FUNDING THAT CAME. WAS SIGNED. WHENEVER THAT WAS LATE DECEMBER EARLY JANUARY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND I'M NOT GONNA GET THE NUMBERS RIGHT. IT WAS ROUGHLY SIX POINT SEVEN OR SIX POINT NINE BILLION TO CALIFORNIA I THINK SIX BILLION WENT DIRECTLY TO TITLE ONE SCHOOLS AND DIDN'T PASS THROUGH THE STATE. BUT THERE WAS SOME DISCRETIONARY MONEY IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU DON'T THINK ANYTHING WITHIN THAT IS A CANDIDATE TO COMPLEMENT THIS THESE PROGRAMS. ELEAZAR HOW THE- TO USE THESE FUNDS TO COMPLEMENT THE OTHER ROWING THOSE AS BUT I'M I'M SAYING THAT THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT THAT COMES THROUGH THE STATE THAT THE STATE WILL HAVE TO APPROPRIATE AND- AND- I'M GATHERING FROM YOUR COMMENT. YOU'RE SAYING SHOULD BE ANY OF THE L. A. L. L. E. AS THAT GOT. FEDERAL MONEY THAT SHOULD USE THAT TO COMPLIMENTED IT SHOULD NOT BE ANY OF THE DISCRETIONARY MONEY THAT CAME THROUGH THE STATE. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T CATCH THE END OF THE- THERE'S DISCRETIONARY MONEY THAT CAME THROUGH THE STATE AND YOU SAY THEY CAN USE FEDERAL MONEY TO DO IT AND NOT EVERY DISTRICT IS A TITLE ONE DISTRICT. AND WE HAVE DISCRETIONARY MONEY IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND I AM ASKING IF WHEN YOU SAY THEY SHOULD JUST USE FEDERAL MONEY. THAT YOU'RE NOT CONSIDERING IN ANY WAY THE DISCRETIONARY MONEY THAT PASSES THROUGH- IS A VERY SMALL PIECE OF THAT WOULD BE USEFUL FOR THIS PURPOSE. I AM NOT PREPARED TO SPEAK ON THAT I DON'T HAVE ANY DETAILS ON THAT- AND THEN. NO NEED FOR YOU TO TAKE MORE WORDS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE DETAILS BUT IT BUT IT'S LIKE I WOULD JUST SAY IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD CONSIDER HEADING TOWARD. OF THE MAY REVISE GIVENS- WHAT THE L. A. O. SAID YOU'RE GOING TO GOING TO ANOTHER POINT. YES IT **** AMY LEE MENTIONED. THAT SHE NOTICED SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS WERE DUPLICATIVE OR COVERED THE SAME. AREAS AND THIS SPECIFICALLY DOLLARS RELATED TO THE ETHNIC STUDIES AND I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT. TYPES OF MONEY. FOR THE ETHNICS. ONE IS TO GUARD SUCH MATTER. ARE OF FUNDING AND THAT SUPPORT CLASS NETWORKS K. TWELVE TEACHERS AND UNIVERSITY FACULTY OVER A SUSTAINED PERIOD OF TIME- TO DEVELOP TEACHER SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE IN PROVIDING ETHNIC STUDIES WELL THE OTHER- ALLOCATION OF FUNDING WOULD GO TO A COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION THAT WOULD CREATE. SOME RESOURCES AVAILABLE STATEWIDE TO ALL ELLIE AS GIVEN THAT HE- CALIFORNIA'S SUBJECT MATTER PROJECTS NOT. PROPERTY FREE OF CHARGE TO ALL ELLIE AS FINALLY TO SOME ELEAZAR OTHER AT LEAST HAVE TO PAY FOR TEACHERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SUBJECT MATTER PROJECTS MAN BEFORE I ASKED SENATOR MENIFEE HAS ANY QUESTIONS- MS. LEE DO YOU HAVE ANY RESPONSE TO THAT. YOU'RE A LEYVA LEN I THINK WERE JUST MENTION THAT I. THESE DETAILS FOR THIS SUBJECT MATTER PROPOSALS AB WASN'T REALLY MADE CLEAR TO US SO HAPPY TO REVIEW ANY DETAILS THAT I DEPARTMENT FINANCES ABLE TO OFFER I THINK IN GENERAL ARE COMMENTS EARLIER COMMENT STANDS THAT WE THINK. PROVIDING CAD PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT ON I THINK STUDIES THROUGH DATA UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SUBJECT MATTER PROJECTS AND THEN SEPARATELY THROUGH A S. C. O. T. I THINK IS RATHER DUPLICATIVE. GREAT THANK YOU MUCH IN ORDER MOVE ON TO. A SENATOR MEN DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THE SIDE- JUST ONE- SO I'M I'M PROUD TO NOTE THAT THE ORANGE COUNTY DEPARTMENT EDUCATION WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY IN MY DISTRICT. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF SUPERINTENDENT ON THE HARNESS I HAVE BEEN PART OF THE TO COUNTY SPEARHEADING THE EMPTY SS PROJECT- I GUESS MY QUESTION AND I YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE HOLISTIC LEARNING. WHEN IN OUR SOCIETY WE TALK ABOUT EACH Q. AS BEING JUST AS IMPORTANT AS I Q. YOU KNOW I AM REALLY HEARTENED BY THE GOALS OF THIS PROGRAM BUT I GUESS MY QUESTION IS. WHY ARE WE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT STEPS DO WE NEED TO TAKE TO REALLY IMPLEMENT A MORE RAPID STATEWIDE ADOPTION OF THIS- AND SHOULD WE BE LOOKING ORE DOES A STATEWIDE APPROACH AND EMPHASIZING THAT RATHER THAN SOMEONE OF THE PIECEMEAL APPROACH WE HAVE NOW. AND I GUESS THAT WOULD BE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. ARE WE GONNA HAVE A STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION I THINK THAT WILL NEED TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT PARTICULAR QUESTION- YOU CAN COULD YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT MORE OF WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THEIR- YOU COULD JUST AS FAR AS YOU KNOW IN TALKING BRIEFLY WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT MAHAR AS I THINK. YOU KNOW THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY VERY HAPPY TO BE SPEARHEADING THIS BUT- THEY WERE HOPING AND I THINK WE'RE ALL HOPING FOR I WOULD CERTAINLY BE HOPING FOR JUST. THINKING MORE AMBITIOUSLY ABOUT HOW WE ADOPT THE STATEWIDE AND I KNOW WE'VE GOT A LEARNING MODULE IN PLACE NOW- BUT WHAT SORT OF FUNDING WOULD WE NEED WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS WE NEED TO REALLY MOVE THIS MORE AGGRESSIVELY INTO STATEWIDE. PROGRAM RIGHT. HE SENT AN ACTUALLY GONNA DIFFER I HAVE WITH ME BARBARA MURCHISON WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE EDUCATOR ASK WHAT. EDUCATOR EXCELLENCE AND EQUITY DIVISION HERE IT'S EASY TO OVERSEE THESE PROGRAMS FINING. THANK YOU. HI GOOD MORNING- GARBER MURCHISON DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- WHERE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT ORANGE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF ED AND- YOU COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR STATEWIDE AND TSS. SCALING UP- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THIS IS THE FOURTH INVESTMENT. IN THIS PROGRAM THE FIRST ONE WAS JUST BUILDING A FRAMEWORK FOR WHAT CALIFORNIA M. TSS MODEL MIGHT LOOK LIKE. MAKING SURE THAT ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY OFFICES WERE SUPPORTED. TO UNDERSTAND THAT MODEL AND SUPPORT THEIR DISTRICTS HALF OF CALIFORNIA ELEAZAR PARTICIPATED IN TRAINING AND RECEIVE FUNDS. TO BEGIN WORK TO SHIFT. THEIR THEIR PARADIGM FOR HOW WE SUPPORT ALL STUDENTS TO THE CALIFORNIA M. TSS MODEL. THAT FIRST TWO. YEARS OF INITIAL INVESTMENT. KIND OF BROUGHT. A GOOD BASELINE TO THE STATE. FOR WHAT THIS COULD LOOK LIKE. M. THE THIRTY OF INVEST REALLY MORE AT DISPROPORTIONATE ALITY AROUND SUSPENSIONS AND CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM. AND AS NOTED- THE DEPARTMENT ORANGE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF ED AND BUTTE COUNTY OFFICE OF ED IN PARTNERSHIP. WITH UCLA CENTER FOR TRANSFORMATION OF SCHOOLS IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING RESOURCES AND PROVIDING ADDITIONAL TRAININGS AND PILOTING WITH A SET OF DISTRICTS AROUND HOW SCHOOL CLIMATE CAN BE SUPPORTED. TO ADDRESS THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY SPECIFICALLY SO NOW WITH THIS ADDITIONAL FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSED INVESTMENT- WORLD WILL BE BUILDING OUT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ORANGE COUNTY AND BUTTE COUNTY. ANOTHER SET OF RESOURCES MORE SPECIFICALLY TO DIVE DEEPER INTO THE S. E. L. PORTION OF THE CALIFORNIA MTS THIS FRAMEWORK WE KNOW THAT STUDENTS HAVE BEEN. IMPACTED IN THE THAT THE POLITE WAY OF SAYING IT THERE'S A LOT OF A RIPPLE EFFECT AROUND THE PANDEMIC FOR THE LAST YEAR WE KNOW THE DEMAND FOR SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SUPPORTS HAS. INCREASED SO I THINK WHAT WE SEE AS WE'RE PHASING IN AND LAYERING ON ADDITIONAL AREAS OF FOCUS TO SHORE UP AND PROVIDE OUR EDUCATORS AND DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE. WITH ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND TRAINING- ON VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF THE M. T. S. S. MODEL- EACH YEAR SO I'M NOT SURE IF THE REQUEST IS THAT I'M I'M WITH- MY COLLEAGUE ELLIE GARNER AROUND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT'S REQUESTED BUT THIS KIND OF PHASED IN. APPROACH TO BUILD ON THE CALIFORNIA M. TSS MODEL INCREASING CAPACITY OF ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AS WE GO- ACTUALLY IS WELCOMED AND MAKES GOOD SENSE TO US. GOT IT I WILL. THE QUITE A PROCESS THANK YOU OKAY THAT SOUNDS FIVE SENATOR MAN WE THANK THE PANEL WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER SIX COMMUNITY SCHOOLS GRANT PROGRAM WAS MY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WE GARNER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION MICHAEL OFFERED US FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE LET'S GO IN THAT ORDER AND BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE MORNING TURN MEMBERS AT LEAST MY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE BUDGET PROVIDES TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO EXPAND UPON. THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL PARTNERSHIP GRANT PROGRAM THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT TO HOLISTICALLY ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS CHILDREN. COMMUNITY SCHOOLS OFFER A UNIQUE MODEL TO MORE EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY PROVIDE INTEGRATED EDUCATIONAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO STUDENTS WAS A WRITER WIDE RANGE OF NEEDS. TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS VERY SIMILAR TO EXISTING LANGUAGE AROUND THE PROGRAM WITH THE CUTE DITION DAS FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. AS WELL AS EXPANDING AND ENHANCING EXISTING COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL GROUNDS WHAT SUPPORT LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS TO IMPLEMENT THE PILLARS OF THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL MODEL WHICH ARE PROVIDING INTENSIVE WRAPAROUND SERVICES. OFFERING EXPANDED LEARNING TIME AND LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES DEVELOPING COLLABORATIVE LEADERSHIP AND SUPPORT FOR EDUCATORS AND OFFERING SUPPORT FOR FAMILY AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT- UP 21% OF THE ALLOCATION CAN BE USED FOR PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS WHO WANT TO EXPAND OR ESTABLISH THEIR OWN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCHWILL MOVE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THANK YOU CHAIR. OF THE GOVERNOR AND WE HAVE THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. THE SCHOOLS ARE ONE OF THE S. S. P. I.'S PRIORITIES AND HE HAS DONE SIGNIFICANT WORK IN THIS SPACE I NEARLY BECAUSE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS SUPPORT THE NEEDS OF THE WHOLE CHILD INCLUDING MENTAL AND BEHAVIOR HEALTH TRAUMA INFORMED CARE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING RESTORATIVE JUSTICE ANDOTHER KEY AREAS. SCHOOLS CAN USE THIS INTEGRATED APPROACH TAKE INCREASE ACCESS TO NURSES COUNSELORS AND SCIAL WORKERS READING PLACES WHERE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO SERVICES THEY NEED TO CLOSE THE OPPORTUNITY GAP. LAST YEAR'S BUDGET INCLUDED THE FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY SCHOOL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM C. S. P. P. GRANT. THE CITY RECEIVED A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED AND TWO APPLICANTS WITH THE TOTAL ASK OF A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OR THREE HUNDRED AND 76% OF TOTAL FINES. THE CDC WILL ANNOUNCE PRELIMINARY WORK SHORTLY BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE GRANT PROCESS WAS VERY COMPETITIVE WITH A SCORE OF EIGHTY NINE OUT OF A HUNDRED SERVING AS THE CUT OFF FOR GRANTEES. TWENTY APPLICANTS WERE SELECTED AS GRANTEES AND THESE GRANTEES WERE MADE OF CONSORTIUMS AMSINGLE SCHOOLS WITH AWARDS RANGING FROM THREE HUNDRED NINETY SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. TO THREE MILLION DOLLARS. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE DEMAND FOR FUNDS WAS AND IS SGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN THE FUNDS PROVIDED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WE ARE EXCITED TO SEE THE FUNDING THIS YEAR AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE DEMAND WILL BE MUCH HIGHER UNDER THE CURRENT PROPOSAL. BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS ROUND OF FUNDING WAS LIMITED TO EXISTING COMMUNITY SCHOOLS THAT IS NOT THE CASE WITH THIS NEW FUNDING SO WHEN COUPLED WITH THE INCREASE TIMELINE FOR USING THE FUNDS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THERE WILL BE EVEN GREATER DEMAND FOR THIS NEW ROUND OF FUNDING. I HAVE WITH ME TODAY P. CALLAS AND THESE ARE MEMBERS OF THE COLLEGE AND CAREER TRANSITIONS VISION TO ADDRESS ANY PROGRAMMATIC QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NOW. WILL MOVE TO THE LA O'S OFFICE. GOOD MORNING SENATORS MICHAEL FINISHED WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE WANTED TO SHARE OUR THREE CONCERNS AND SO ALSO SEE RECOMMENDATIONS TO MODIFY THIS PROPOSAL. OUR FIRST CONCERN IS RELATED TO THE STATE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE REQUIREMENTS- RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT COMMUNITIES SCHOOLS TEND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH POSITIVE STUDENT ASK WELCOMES HOWEVER SUCCESSFUL ADOPTION REQUIRES FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES THAT CAN BE COMPLICATED FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IMPLEMENT. DISTRICTS WITHOUT PRIOR EXPERIENCE OPERATING COMMUNITIES CLOSE MAY NEED HELP LEARNING HOW TO DEVELOP EXTERNAL PARTNERSHIPS COLLABORATE WITH OTHER PUBLIC AGENCIES AND IDENTIFY ONGOING FUNDING STREAMS IMPLEMENT AND SUSTAIN THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS MODEL. REALIZATION IS NOT SPECIFY HOW THE STATE WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND YOU KNOW THE RESTAURANT GRANTS PROVIDE IN THE CURRENT YEAR OR IN THE BUDGET YOUR PROPOSAL. OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE CITY IS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A PLANT AND CHRYSOSTOM'S THE PROVIDER FOR THE FIRST FUNDING GRANTS. HOWEVER SINCE THE PROPOSAL FOR THE SECOND ROUND OF GRANTS INCLUDING A COMMUNITY SCHOOLS THAT MAY BE MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND EXISTING ONES. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE SET SPECIFIC EXPECTATIONS FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. AT A MINIMUM WE RECOMMEND THE STATE IN THE CLOSEST AND BE AVAILABLE TO ASSIST SCHOOLS WITH. CONDUCTING A COMMUNITY SCHOOLS MRS ESTIMATE. THE IMPROVING COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CREATING COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND DEVELOPING. SUSTAINABLE FUNDING SOURCES. AMERICA THAT THIS IS THE AVAIL FOR US. APPLICANTS AND GRAMS IF WE- OUR SECOND CONCERN IS WITH THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- AT THE STATE IN ORDER FOR THE STATE SUPPORT COMMUNITY SCHOOLS THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IS ABLE TO SET ASIDE UP TO ONE PERCENT. OF THE FUNDING TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE SPECIFIC THAT THE CLOSEST OUR REQUIREMENTS ARE DISCUSSED WOULD REQUIRE SPENDING MORE THAN 1% OF THE PROGRAM. THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER INCREASING THE AMOUNT THAT CAN BE SET ASIDE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. OF THE PROPOSED GRANT WOULD PROVIDE ABOUT TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT COULD BE SPENT OVER FOUR YEARS. OUR BUS SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO THOUSAND PER YEAR. THIS IS SOMEWHAT HIGHER THAN THE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND AVAILABLE OVER ONE YEAR UNDER THE CURRENT ROUND OF GRANTS- TO ASSESS WHETHER THAT AMOUNT IS SUFFICIENT THE LEGISLATURE CAPACITY YOU NEED TO REPORT IN THE SPRING ON WHETHER THEY WANT TO NICKEL SYSTEMS AVAILABLE IN THE CURRENT YEAR. HAS BEEN SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE FIRST ROUND OF GRANTEES. YOU WOULDN'T KNOW HOWEVER THAT SINCE THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES. NEW COMMUNITY SCHOOLS WHERE THE FRENCH GROUNDED NOT THERE WILL LIKELY BE MORE NEED FOR DEBT SUBSTANTIAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN THE FIRST ROUND OF GRANTS. OUR THIRD. IS THAT TRANSLATION. TO PUT IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS AT A DISADVANTAGE. THE PHARMACIST IN THE TRAILER LANGUAGE IS THE SAME AS THE FIRST UNDERGRADS. AND INCLUDES THINGS SUCH AS HAVING COMMITTED MATCHING FUNDS FOR PEOPLE SERVICES. HAVING A PLAN FOR ASSISTING THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL SERVICES DR GRANT RATIONS. IS CRITERIA PUT EXISTING COMMUNITY SCHOOLS THAT ARE FARTHER ALONG IN THE IMPLEMENTATION. AND AN ADVANTAGE OVER NO COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. TO ENSURE GRANTS WERE AWARDED TO APPLICANTS INTERESTED IN ESTABLISHING A COMMUNITY SCHOOLS WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE SPENT FUNDING IN TWO SEPARATE GRANTS. ONE FOR EXPANDING EXISTING COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. AND ONE FIRST ABORIGINAL COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. THIS APPROACH FOR EXPAND THE MODEL MORE EQUITABLY ACROSS THE STATE. AND ENSURE FUNDING CAN BENEFIT COMMUNITIES THAT DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO WRITE MORE. COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES THAT OUR STUDENTS. THE COULD CAN PUSHING BACK OUT. DEADLINE FOR THOSE SEEKING TO ESTABLISH NEW PROGRAMS TO LATER IN THE FISCAL YEAR. THIS WOULD GIVE AT LEAST MORE TIMES SICK THANK MORE SYSTEMS. AND PROVIDE- SORRY TO DEVELOP PARTNERSHIPS PARTS APPLICATION DEADLINE. IS ROLLER COMMON HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. I APPRECIATE EVERY CAR- MORE SORT OF SHORT ON SO I THINK I'M GOING TO NOTE LA OWES COMMENTS AGAINST THIS AND WILL TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THEM. ARE GOING TOWARD- OF. THE MAY REVISED A SENATOR MEN DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ONE NO QUESTION SO LET ME THANK THE PANEL. AND WE WILL MOVE TO- ISSUE SEVEN. A WHICH IS THE OTHER BUDGET PROPOSALS AND BILL LANGUAGE. AND ON THIS PANEL BE MORE SICKENING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MICHAEL AFFAIRS AGAIN FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND NOW WE GARNER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WILL BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING LISTENING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I'M IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'LL JUST QUICKLY RUN THROUGH THE REMAINING BUDGET TRAILER BILL PROPOSALS. AS DISPLAYED IN ON THE AGENDA ON PAGES TWENTY FIVE AND TWENTY SIX THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES THREE POINT ONE MILLION IN ONE TIME FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THE FOURTH YEAR COST OF THE STANDARDIZED ACCOUNT CODE STRUCTURE SYSTEM REPLACEMENT PROJECT. AND FOUR MILLION IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR SPECIAL OLYMPICS OF NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR VARIOUS PROGRAMS- WE HAVE ALSO PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WILL CLARIFY CHANGES TO THE PROCESS BY WHICH COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION- BUDGETS ARE CERTIFIED AND OVERSEEN BY THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. A LANGUAGE TO CHANGE THE MAXIMUM REPAYMENT HERE IN FOR FUNDS OWED BY DISTRICTS TO SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAMS FROM FIVE YEARS TO TWENTY YEARS. ALIGNING WITH THE REPAYMENT PERIOD FOR WORKING EMERGENCY APPORTIONMENT. LANGUAGE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CONTROL OVER THAT LEGISLATION PROCESS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WHEN WE FIX. WHICH PROGRAMS ADULTS AT CHARTER SCHOOLS COULD GENERATE LCI FAST REQUIRE DOCUMENTATION TO VERIFY THESE PARTNERSHIPS AND GRANDFATHERS AND SCHOOLS CURRENTLY SERVING ADULTS THAT HAVE BEEN MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE STATUTE TO BE CAPPED AT THEIR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY. FUNDING LEVEL. ADDITIONALLY WE'VE ALSO PROPOSED LANGUAGE THAT REVISES THE CALCULATION OF PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH DISTANCE LEARNING ATTENDANCE- ADJUSTMENTS TO FUNDING CALCULATION FOR PIONEER UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT AND PARADISE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. BROUGHT ABOUT PROVIDE FUNDING RELIEF RELATED TO NATURAL DISASTERS. LANGUAGE TO SUSPEND THE CALCULATION OF ALLOCATING CHARTER SCHOOL EIGHTY EIGHT TO A SPONSORING SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR.
