THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M SO HONORED TO BE BEFORE YOU THIS IS MY FIRST DAY OF PRESENTING BILLS THAT I THANK YOU SO VERY MCH. AND I APPRECIATE. YOUR HOSPITALITY AND WARMTH THAT I'VE RECEIVED AS A NEW FRESHMAN SENATOR. AND TODAY I AM HERE TO PRESENT SENATE SENATE BILL. FOUR OH FIVE IS ONE OF THE FIRST BILLS I PRODUCE THE AND I CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE WHAT WE CALL A DISTRICT BILL BECAUSE I THINK IT AFFECTS EVERYONE OF OUR DISTRICTS. IN REALITY IT'S A DISTRICT BILL FOR ALL OF US AS I HAD MENTIONED. FOR THE PAST DECADE I'VE SERVED THE CITY COUNCIL AND MAYOR AND CITY PEAK RIVERA. IN EVERY DAY I SAW HE KERRY ATION OF OUR STREETS AND ROADWAYS JUSTICE IN YOUR DISTRICT AT HOME. FORTUNATELY SB ONE WAS ENACTED IN NOW BEEN IMPLEMENTED. AT ONE BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR AND HAS BEEN EARMARKED FOR STREET REPAIR AND WE HAVE BOTH TATIAN. OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS THIS WILL RESULT IN REPAYMENT OF THOUSANDS OF ROADS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE FLIP SIDE TO THIS POSITIVE STORY IS THAT MILLIONS OF TONS OF ASPHALT PAVEMENT WILL BE STOCKPILED THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITIES. THERE IS NO SECONDARY MARKET FOR THIS MATERIAL IT JUST KEEPS STOCKING UP PILING UP AND PILING UP. IN THE PAST RECYCLED ASPHALT. OR GRANDES WITH A GREAT CHOICE FOR US IN THAT BASE BUT IN IN -- IN THE BUILDINGS OF NEW FREEWAYS HOWEVER WE HAVE A PROBLEM TODAY. BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO THE RIGHT THING IF WE DON'T LOOK AT WHAT WE HAVE FACING US RIGHT NOW. SB ONE IS ABOUT MADE HIS AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND I'M TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR CITIES ARE COMMUNITIES AND THE HEALTH OF OUR CITIZENS. CALTRANS CURRENTLY ALLOWS FOR SMALL AMOUNTS OF DRY NEEDS TO BE ADDED TO VIRGIN ASPHALT IN STREET IN REAL BILL REHABILITATION PROJECTS. THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES -- LOCKED UP 250% RECYCLED MATERIAL. BUT IN BOTH CASES YOU STILL HAVE LARGE AMOUNTS OF WRITINGS THAT NEED TO BE STOCKPILE. AND I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT TO JUST SHRUG FOR THE RECORD THAT WHEN I MENTIONED DISTRICTS I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT DISTRICT. TWENTY TWO THERE ARE QUITE A BIT OF STOCKPILES MY OWN DISTRICT THE THIRTY TWO DISTRICT A THRE ARE JUST FOR A HANDFUL BUT THERE'S QUITE A FEW. THE DISTRICTS THAT ARE THAT ARE RIGHT IN QUESTION AND AND WE SHOULD ALL BE CONCERNED ABOUT. AND IF I MAY CONTINUE. SB FOUR FIVE ATTENTION DEMONSTRATE THAT 85% 21100% OF THESE GRANNIES CAN BE MADE -- NEW BY ADDING A REJUVENATED HER IN A PROCESSING PLANT AND RETURN TO THE STREET THAT IT CAME FROM. SIMILAR WORK IS CURRENTLY UNDER WAY IN COMPANIES IN INDIANA AND NEW YORK AND WE ALWAYS KNOW THE CALIFORNIA'S ALWAYS A LEADER BUT WE NEED TO PLAY CATCH UP ON THIS GAME. IN ADDITION TO REDUCING A LOOMING ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM THAT COMES FROM HAVING THE PILES IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO NEIGHBORHOODS AND SCHOOLS AND THERE IS BENEFIT BY NOT HAVING TO TO MIND THESE AGGREGATE SITES. AND HALL THE MATURE TO ASPHALT PRODUCTION FACILITIES OFTEN FROM DISTANT LOCATIONS. AND I'VE BEEN MADE AWARE THAT IN OUR COMMUNITIES PEOPLE ARE COUGHING AND BLEEDING AND THE ENVIRONMENT IS GETTING WORSE. WE MUST DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES WILL MANAGE THE PILOT PROGRAM PROJECT. SELECT THE SITES TO BE TESTED AND PREPARE A THOROUGH ENGINEERING AND ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS FOLLOWING ITS COMPLETION. WE HAVE BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE COUNTY FOR LAST YEAR AND JUST LAST WEEK THE COUNTY OF BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. CAME TOGETHER AND THEY VOTED TO SUPPORT MY BILL. THIS IS AN AND BUSY -- AMBITIOUS EFFORT I REALIZE THAT BUT GREAT THINGS HAVE OFTEN COME WITH AN IDEA. IF WE CAN TURN BACK LIKE -- DAVID PACKARD A GROUNDBREAKING COMPUTER APPLICATION IS GARAGE IN SAN JOSE. AND WITH THE OUR CASE. WE'RE DOING THE SAME THING WE ARE TRYING TO FIND THE BEST WAY TO GO TO THE FUTURE TAKE CARE OF OUR ENVIRONMENT. TAKE CARE OF OUR ROADS AND WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW. I WOULD LIKE NOW TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS AND SB FOUR OH FIVE AND I HAVE MISTER JOHN CORPORAN.

ARE THERE ANY OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD THAT ARE DOING JUST THIS AND THAT'S QUESTION NUMBER. ONE QUESTION NUMBER TWO IS HOW LONG IS THIS PILOT. LET ME TURN IT OVER TO JOHN COCHRAN FOR THE TECHNICAL SIDE AND THAT. IT IS RESEARCH. YES SIR CAN YOU AND YOUR INTRODUCED HERSELF. ANSWER CENTER DODGE QUESTION. JOHN CORCORAN PRESIDENT A MAN WHO JUST INK -- AND WE SUPPORT THIS BILL. LIMITED WORK THAT I'M AWARE OF HAS BEEN DONE IN OTHER COUNTRIES SAW THEY DO HAVE SOME A COUPLE PROCESSES IN EUROPE. ART BUT PRETTY MUCH IN THEIR INFANCY STAGES SO I'M UNAWARE OF ANYTHING THAT HAS BEEN DONE WIDESPREAD IN EUROPE. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS AS OUR SERVER WILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO CARLY YOU MENTIONED SENATE DISTRICT TWENTY TWO WHICH IS MY DISTRICT AND I AGREE AND I THINK THIS IS A FANTASTIC IDEA I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. ARE WHEN THERE'S A PILOT PROGRAM IT IMPLIES WE'RE TRYING TO SEE IF SOMETHING WORKS -- AND DO WE KNOW -- OF OTHER ISSUES THAT THE OTHER STATES THAT YOU MENTIONED HAVE COME ACROSS IN THE REASON I'M ASKING IS. IF SOMETHING DOESN'T WORK WHAT IS PLAN B. TO ENSURE THAT IT GETS TAKEN CARE OF AS ELLIE COUNTY GOING TO TAKE CARE OF WHATEVER GOES WRONG OR WHO'S GONNA BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. LET ME RESPOND TO THAT JUST A LITTLE AND I'LL HAVE JOHN CORK AND FOLLOW THROUGH. AS YOU KNOW -- YOU JUST HEARD EVERYONE IN SUPPORT. AND THIS IS A PROGRAM WITH THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES THERE -- EXCITED ABOUT IT AS I AM. BUT THE ISSUE HERE IS THE NEW TECHNOLOGY THE ISSUE IS TO TO A REDDIT KATIE'S THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES THAT THE SURROUND ALL THESE DISTRICT. SO THE TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGY THAT'S HERE WE HAVE TO GRASP IT AND GO FORWARD WITH IT. CHAU -- ANYTHING ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE I LET GO AND JOHN -- ADDRESS AT COMMITTEE MEMBER RUBIO GOOD QUESTION AN ODD COUPLE THINGS. EVEN THOUGH IT'S A RUBIO PLEASE SENATOR RUBIO ARE SENATOR RUBIO THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION. AND BASICALLY WE'RE DOING A PILOT PROJECT TO DEMONSTRATE. MORE TO THE LOCAL AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA OF THE VIABILITY OF THE HIGH RAP ON THERE'S OPERATIONS RIGHT NOW SIMILAR TO THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S BEING PROPOSED. ARE BEING DONE BY BROOKS CONSTRUCTION IN FORT WAYNE INDIANA. OVER FIVE OR SIX YEAR PERIOD. A PREDECESSOR TO THIS OUR OUR PROCESS WAS CALLED SITE CLEAN DAVID DOT DID QUITE A BIT A WORK ON IN THE LATE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES FOR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. IN FACT ONE OF THE STREETS NINETEEN YEARS OLD IS ALL ON MELROSE AVENUE IN FRONT OF ALL PER MONTH STUDIOS ARE PERFORMING VERY WELL. SO EVEN THOUGH THE TERM PILOT IS MORE IN LINE TO DO ANY OF THE CURRENT TESTING AND QUALIFICATIONS AND ALSO DO WHAT HASN'T BEEN DONE BEFORE. A QUANTIFICATION IN GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ARE. EVEN THOUGH THE PRODUCT HAS BEEN USED BEFORE THESE THINGS NEED TO BE MAY BE BROUGHT UP TO SHOW THE CURRENT STANDARDS BEING MET. AND ALSO ALSO WITHIN COMPENSATION THE ENVIRONMENTAL REDUCTIONS -- IMPACT REDUCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALT PROCESS SENATOR. THANK YOU I JUST IN THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION BUT I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SO CENTER STONE I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- SENATOR ARGILLITE AS WANT TO COMMEND YOU AND COMPLIMENT YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD -- AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT -- THAT I THINK CALTRANS SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKING A MUCH MORE PROACTIVE ROLE OVER IN THE IN THE PAST -- PAST DECADE WITH THE THE SUCCESSFUL PASSAGE OF SB ONE OVER BILLION DOLLARS GOING TO BE USED. TO REPAY OF OUR ROADS WHICH ARE FALLING APART -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND JUST TO CLARIFY THE RECORD IN A NEW YORK AND IN INDIANA. THE THE TO CRY IN 1100% OF THE ASPHALT THEY RECYCLE IT SO THERE IS A MODEL OUT THERE THERE'S BEEN PROVEN TO BE SUCCESSFUL -- I'M FROM RIVERSIDE COUNTY WHICH IS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING COUNTIES IN THE STATE IN FACT THIS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING COUNTIES IN THE COUNTRY. AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN TO BE A RATE LIMITING STEP TO REPAIRING AND BUILDING NEW ROADS IS A SHORTAGE OF AGGREGATE -- AND I THINK IT'S NOT JUST IN SOUTHWEST RIVERSIDE COUNTY IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY MIGHT BE EVEN STATEWIDE AND SO THIS IS GOING. TO TO HELP SOLVE THAT PROBLEM OF AGGREGATE WHY NOT REVIEWS -- IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY WAY -- THE ASPHALT THE COULD BE COMPLETELY UTILIZED AS WELL AS I MET WITH A COMPANY THAT ALSO. RECYCLES TIRES AND USES PARTS OF THE TIRES A PART OF THE NEW ASPHALT WHICH ADDS TO ITS LONGEVITY IS WATER IN PERFECT PERVIOUS STATUS -- AND ACTUALLY ALLOWS FOR A SMOOTHER RIDE SO -- I COMMEND YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD HALF I CANNOT LIKE COULD BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR AND THAT THE CORPORATE COMMA MOVE YOUR BILL.
