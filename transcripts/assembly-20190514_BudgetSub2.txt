TEACHER WORKFORCE EXCUSE ME THE MAYOR VISION INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL AS A MIX OF THE NONPROFIT IS IN. NINETY EIGHT OUR GENERAL FUND AND ALSO SOME FEDERAL FUNDS ARE GOING TOWARD PROMOTING NEW TEACHERS AT SCHOOLS WITH A HIGH NUMBER OF TEACHERS SERVING ON EMERGENCY PERMITS -- PROVIDING STATE WHY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR TEACHERS ON SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING INCLUSIVE PRACTICES AND SUBJECT MATTER COMPETENCE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE. AND PROVIDE STATEWIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND OTHER SCHOOL LEADERS. WITHOUT OUR CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS BUT HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS OUR COLONY COLLEAGUES AS NECESSARY [inaudible] THANK YOU. HELLO. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CAN A COUPON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT THAT THE SERGEANT JUST DISTRIBUTED. I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION GIVE YOU A GOOD OVERVIEW OF THIS MAY REVISION. THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT IT THERE ARE REALLY. THREE NUMBERS TO FOCUS ON THAT KIND OF TELL THE TALE OF WHAT'S IN THIS YEAR IS A PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE. ARE THE FIRST TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX MILLION THAT'S THE INCREASE IN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT ACROSS THE ENTIRE BUDGET PERIOD SO. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN TWENTY I THAT INCREASES MAINLY A FUNCTION OF THE ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND REVENUE. I THINK MOST OF YOU ARE AWARE WE HAD A GOOD REVENUE MONTH IN APRIL AND REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE UP I'M A BIT VÃ  COMPARED TO WHERE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS IN JANUARY -- TURNING-- TO PAGE TWO OF OUR HAND OUT. I THINK THE NEXT IMPORTANT NUMBER IS THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE MILLION THAT'S THE AMOUNT OF THE STATE'S FIRST DEPOSIT INTO THE STATE SCHOOL RESERVE. A LOT OF FORMULAS. KIND OF UNDER PEN THAT RESERVE ACCOUNT BUT THE IDEA IS -- TO THE FORMALIST TRY TO RECOGNIZE HERE IS WHEN THE GUARANTEE IS GOING OUT OF AN ABOVE AVERAGE PACE AND SET ASIDE SOME OF THAT FUNDING FOR TIGHTER FISCAL TIMES. A DEPOSIT THE REQUIRED SPECIFICALLY WHEN THE STATE RECEIVES CAPITAL GAINS ABOVE HAVE ITS LONG TERM AVERAGE. AND WHEN THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED IS ABOVE THE PRIOR YEAR FUNDING LEVEL ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN STUDENT ATTENDANCE AND INFLATION FACTOR. AND THEN THE FINAL NUMBER THAT WE THINK IS IMPORTANT IS A HUNDRED IN NINETEEN MILLION THAT'S THE AMOUNT OF THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. FOR THE GOVERNOR SPECIAL EDUCATION PROPOSAL IN JANUARY THAT PROPOSAL WAS A COMBINATION OF ONE TIME AND I'M GOING SOURCES -- A REVISION UPS THAT. TO NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION AND MAKES ALL THE FUNDING I'M GOING -- BEYOND THE SCHOOL RESERVE DEPOSIT AND TO THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. REALLY ALL OF THE REST OF THE NEW FUNDING IN THIS PACKAGE IS ASSOCIATED WITH TECHNICAL CHANGES SO COVERING SLIGHTLY HIGHER COSTS OF STUDENT ATTENDANCE. A FEW ITEMS NEW CUSTOMERS SINCE JANUARY. BEYOND THAT THERE'S REALLY NOT A WHOLE LOT OF NEW FUNDING INSIDE OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PART OF THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. I TURNING TO PAGE THREE THIS IS REALLY JUST MORE OF A TECHNICAL. SUMMARY OF ALL OF THE SPECIFIC SPENDING CHANGES TO GET INTO ALL OF THOSE IN A SUBSEQUENT HEARING SOMEWHAT SPEND ANY TIME ON ON THOSE THAT TABLE NOW. I TURNING TO PAGE. FOUR WE THINK THIS PROVISION THIS BEING THE VISION HAS SEVERAL POSITIVE ELEMENTS. ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS -- I ALWAYS WE LOOK AT IS BY THE ESTIMATES OF THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE REASONABLE BECAUSE THAT SET THE TABLE FOR ALL OF THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT THE STATE -- MARK CAN AND WANTS TO PROVIDE FOR SCHOOLS IN THE COMING YEAR. THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATES OF GENERAL FUND REVENUE I SLIGHTLY BELOW OURS WE THINK THAT'S LARGELY BECAUSE WE HAD I'M A LITTLE BIT -- MORE RECENT DATA WHEN WE PREPARED OUR ESTIMATES WE ALSO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT WAY OF MODELING THE EFFECTS OF INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF COMPANIES THAT ARE BASED IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S BEEN KIND OF A BIG TOPIC THE LAST FEW WEEKS AND MONTHS -- SO ACROSS THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN TWENTY PERIOD I REVENUE ESTIMATES A LITTLE BIT HIGHER -- BUT OUR ESTIMATES OF THE GUARANTEE I REALLY ONLY A TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ABOVE THE ADMINISTRATION OVER THAT ENTIRE THREE YEAR PERIOD THAT'S ONE OF THE CLOSEST. THE CLOSEST I THINK WE'VE BEEN. IN MANY YEARS AS FAR AS OUR ESTIMATES OF THE GUARANTEE SO WE THINK THAT BUT THE MAYOR VISION IS A REASONABLE STARTING POINT FOR YOUR BUDGET DELIBERATIONS -- THE DEPOSIT INTO THE STATE SCHOOL RESERVE IS A SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT LOTS OF COMPLEX CALCULATIONS -- UNDERMINE THAT WE'VE REVIEWED -- BUT THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES THAT DEPOSIT YOU THINK THEY'D WITH WE THINK THEY ADMINISTER THE FORMULAS ACCURATELY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT TO PROPOSITION. TWO AND IT'S WE THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANT THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME STATE REALLY HAS A DEDICATED SOURCE OF FUNDING -- SET ASIDE NOW SPECIFICALLY TO SUPPLEMENT THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED DURING TIED TO IT ECONOMIC TIMES YES I THINK THAT COMPLEMENT SOME OF THE THINGS YOU'VE DONE ELSEWHERE IN YOUR BUDGET TO TRY. TO MOVE THE STATE AND EVEN FOR MY FISCAL FOOTING -- THE MAYOR VISION ALSO REVISITS THE MIX OF ONE TIME AND I'M GOING PRO PROPOSALS AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT MIX REALLY DETERMINES WHETHER YOU HAVE. REALLY A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT OR SURPLUS GOING INTO. YOUR BUDGET DELIBERATIONS IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. AND IN THIS AREA WE THINK THE MAYOR VISION IS A REALLY MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAD PROPOSED SPENDING ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION MORE ON ON GOING PROGRAMS THAN IT HAD AVAILABLE ON GOING WE SOURCES SO A LITTLE BIT OF A DEFICIT. OVER THE LONG RUN OTHER NAY REVISION ELIMINATES THAT AND IN FACT IT SPENDS IT BUILDS IN A SMALL SURPLUS OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. I HEADING INTO. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THEN FINALLY ON THE PROGRAMMATIC SIDE WE THINK THE CHANGES TO THE KINDERGARTEN FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM ARE ANOTHER POSITIVE STEP. OUT OUR ANALYSIS AND FOUND THAT IT UNDER THE CURRENT PROGRAM A LOT OF THOSE FUNDS ARE GOING TO DISTRICTS THAT ALREADY RUN FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS. AT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL I THINK WOULD TRY TO GET THE PROGRAM MORE TOWARD YOUR CORE INTEREST WHICH WAS INCURRING TRAJAN DISTRICTS TO CONVERT FROM. A PARTY TO FULL DAY PROGRAMS. WE THINK THAT THE MAN FOR THE PROGRAM IS STILL LIKELY TO BE LESS THAN SIX HUNDRED MILLION SO IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO FREE UP FUNDING FOR YOUR OTHER PRIORITIES YOU COULD CONSIDER FUNDING A SMALLER AMOUNT. FOR THAT GRANT PROGRAM. I FINALLY TURNING TO PAGE FIVE A HIGHLIGHT I JUST TOOK CONCERNS WE THINK YOU SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT. A ONE IS THAT EVEN THOUGH THE MAYOR VISION DOES HAVE THIS SMALL ONE TIME CUSHION OF ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. THAT'S STILL VERY MODEST IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE PREVIOUSLY AND WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN A RECESSION. OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS YOU'VE SET ASIDE AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR FOR ONGOING. ACTIVITIES SO -- AN APPRECIABLE QUESTION IF THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED DROPS. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION IT IS SOMETHING THAT COULD VANISH VERY QUICKLY IF THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE SLOW AS WE HAVE AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. AND SO WE THINK AS YOU REVIEW SOME OF THE SPECIFICS BUT SPENDING PROPOSALS. WHEN I THINK ABOUT -- SHIFTING A LITTLE BIT MORE TOWARDS A ONE TIME ACTIVITIES AND NOT QUITE AS MUCH ON GOING SPENDING AS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES. IN TERMS OF SPEND SPECIFIC SPENDING PROPOSALS -- WE DO IT CAN I CONTINUE TO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE SPECIAL EDUCATION GRANT PROPOSAL -- ON THIS -- ONE THE CONCERN IS THAT THE FUNDING IS ALLOCATED ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER ONE OF THE FACTORS IN THE PROGRAM IS THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO RIDE IDENTIFIED WITH A DISABILITY. AND OUR CONCERN IS THAT CREATES A POOR INCENTIVES BECAUSE DISTRICTS THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. WITH EITHER FUNDING DROP UNDER THIS PROGRAM AND DISTRICTS THAT SORT OF MAINTAIN IDENTIFICATION RATES -- THEY ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO SEE IF THE SAME OR EVEN MORE FUNDING. AND IT'S NOT JUST POCKET CHANGE -- THE AMOUNT FOR DISTRICTS THAT QUALIFY FOR THIS PROGRAM KIND OF ON THE MARGIN EACH ADDITIONAL STUDENT THE IDENTIFIER DON'T IDENTIFY IS WORTH MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT SO IT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT -- FISCAL COMMON SENATE FOR SOME OF THESE DISTRICTS -- WHAT WE'VE WE THINK YOU'VE GOT SOME OTHER OPTIONS THAT MIGHT HAVE BETTER ADDRESSED SOME OF YOUR LONG STANDING CONCERNS WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION -- ONE WOULD BE TO FOCUS ON FINDING IT EQUALIZATION WE THINK THAT WOULD DISTRIBUTE FUNDING BOTH MORE BROADLY AND IT WOULD ALSO REDUCE THE STRUGGLE FUNDING INEQUITIES WITHOUT CREATING ANY OF THESE. KINDS OF INCENTIVE CONCERNS. WE ALSO THINK YOU COULD CONSIDER A PROVIDING SOME FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR PRESCHOOL SPECIAL EDUCATION CURRENTLY THAT SOMETHING THAT DISTRICTS ARE REQUIRED TO DO BUT THERE IS NO DEDICATED FUND SOURCE FOR THAT. A SO WITH THAT YOU'LL BE HEARING -- CAM THINGS OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE JUST TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW PRESCHOOL AND CHILDCARE THANK YOU. MORNING SIR CORTEZ LA -- I JUST OF A FEW HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS ON CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL FUNDING THE MAY REVISION HAS A FUNDING FOR CHILDCARE PRESCHOOL -- PROGRAMS UP BY SEVENTY NINE MILLION COMPARED TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS IS A COMBINATION OF DECREASE IN GENERAL FUND AN INCREASE IN FEDERAL FUNDS. THE BOOK OF THE DECREASE IN GENERAL FUND IS DUE TO THE LATER START DATE FOR THIS FOR THE STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS -- WITH REGARD TO THE STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS -- THE GOVERNOR ALSO WITHDRAWS HIS PLAN TO SERVE ALL LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLDS BY. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO WITH NOT HAVING A PLAN TO SERVE ALL LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLDS AND ALSO REMOVING THE WORK REQUIRED REQUIREMENTS -- WE ARE EVEN MORE CONCERNED ABOUT REMOVING THE WORK REQUIREMENT SIMILAR WITH THEIR CONCERNS IN JANUARY. JUST NOT HAVING THAT PLAN IN PLACE TO SERVE ALL LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLDS AND DOING THAT ACTION -- THE GOVERNOR CONTINUES TO PER OF MADE SOME TRAILER BILL CHANGES TO THAT WITH SOMEONE TIME PROPOSALS FOR FACILITIES WORK FORCE AND PLANNING INITIATIVES. FOR THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WITH REGARD TO THE FACILITY GRANT OF FUNDING -- WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE LANGUAGE MINIMIZE MINIMIZE LEGISLATIVE INPUT AS A LOT OF SOME OF THE BASIC IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS ARE. ON THE ADMINISTRATION WILL DETERMINE BY MARCH FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY ANOTHER KEY COMPONENT OF THE EARLY EDUCATION BUDGET IS THE GOVERNOR PLANS -- TO HAS SOME FEDERAL FUND INCREASING PLANS TO MAKE A RECENT FEDERAL FUNDING BUT BUT FUND GRANT A FOR CHILD CARE SPECIFICALLY TREAT THAT IS ONGOING. AND THE ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO SPEND THESE FEDERAL FUNDS IN A VERY BIG WAY. SOME WITH SOME PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES IN THE STAGE ONE PROGRAM AND ALSO GO CREATING A NEW VOUCHERS A VOUCHER PILOT PROGRAM. AND WE WOULD JUST NOTICES ONE PLAN THAT THE IN THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER BUT THE LEGISLATURE HAS QUITE A BIT DISCRETION ON HOW TO SPEND. AND HOTTEST BUT THESE FUNDS AND THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. A GOOD MORNING -- MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND STAFF MY NAME'S KIND JACKSON ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND. THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION APPRECIATES THE GOVERNOR'S -- CONTINUE COMMITMENT TO K. -- TWELVE PARTICULARLY IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE BUDGET -- TO INCLUDE THE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER TRAINING STEAM IN EARLY EDUCATION. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY AND CONTINUE TO HAVE ADDITIONAL DIGITAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. SO THE SUPERINTENDENT IS APPRECIATIVE TO SEE A MILLION DOLLARS IN THE MAY REVISION FOR STATE -- COMPUTER SCIENCE COORDINATOR AS WELL AS FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO EXPAND BROADBAND INTERNET CAPACITY TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN THE TEACHER PIPELINE. NINETY MILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TEACHERS UP TO TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GRANTS FOR TEACHING IN CERTAIN SCHOOLS AND SUBJECT AREAS. ALMOST FORTY MILLION ONE TIME FUND TO PROVIDE TRAINING AND RESOURCES THE CLASSROOM TEACHERS. INCLUDING TEACHERS CARE PROFESSIONALS IN ORDER TO BUILD CAPACITY AROUND INCLUSIVE PRACTICES SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING COMPUTER SCIENCE A RESTORATIVE PRACTICES AS WELL AS SUBJECT MATTER COMPETENCY. TO INCLUDE STING. ANOTHER THIRTEEN POINT NINE MILLION ONGOING FEDERAL FUNDS FOR PROFESSIONAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR K. TWELVE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ADMINISTRATORS TO PROVIDE THE KNOWLEDGE SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES. NECESSARY TO SUCCESSFULLY SUPPORT THE DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATIONS THAT WE SERVE. WERE ALSO -- SUPPORTIVE. AND WE'RE GRATEFUL TO SEE THE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN K. TWELVE OUTSIDE OF PROP. NINETY EIGHT THE ADDITIONAL FOUR POINT NOT A FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION BILLION DOLLARS OF NON PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING IS SIGNIFICANT. THESE RESOURCES WILL HELP OUR DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS AND COUNTY OFFICES PREPARE OUR STUDENTS. TO SUCCEED IN THE FUTURE FOR EXAMPLE THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARSIN ONE TIME PROP NINETY EIGHT INVESTMENTS ND CAL STIRS. THIS IS SIGNIFICANT IN THAT IT WILL PROVIDE THE IMMEDIATE FISCAL RELIEF TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR THE RISING COSTS OF PENSIONS. AND AS WE KNOW THIS IS IMPORTANT TO SCHOOLS SO THAT THEY CAN MAINTAIN THEIR COMMITMENT TO US RESPECTFUL RETIREMENT FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES AND TEACHERS WHILE ALSO MEETING THEIR FINANCIAL OPERATING OBLIGATIONS. THE SUPERINTENDENT SUPPORTS AND APPRECIATES THE AND ADDITIONAL HUNDRED AND NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS -- PROPOSING TO MEET MAY REVISE FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING ENSURING THAT OUR ELEAZAR CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES UNDER PROVISIONS OF THE ID A RECOGNIZING THAT OUR STATE'S HIGHEST NEED YOUTH OFTEN REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT. SERVICES EMPLACEMENTS SIMULTANEOUSLY THE SUPERINTENDENT IS CALLING ON THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND CONGRESS TO MEET THEIR FALL I D. E. A.. OBLIGATIONS. ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT ITEM IS AFFORDABLE TEACHER HOUSING. WE HAVE SEEN BODIES OF EVIDENCE AND WE SEE IN OUR COMMUNITIES THE DIFFICULTIES THAT OUR TEACHERS HAVE BEEN OBTAINING AFFORDABLE AND SECURE HOUSING. AND WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S INVESTING IN COMMUNITIES THAT WILL ULTIMATELY SUPPORT AFFORDABLE WORKFORCE HOUSING SO THAT TEACHERS CAN LIVE IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY WORK. IT IS VITAL THAT OUR DISTRICT SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY OFFICES RECRUIT THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST TEACHERS FOR STUDENTS. WHEN WE INVEST IN OUR TEACHERS THEY WILL INVEST IN OUR STUDENTS? THE MAY REVISION INCLUDE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO PARTNER WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE HOUSING PRODUCTION THROUGH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDING. OF WHICH JURISDICTIONS WOULD RECEIVE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. TO SUPPORT TECHNICAL ASSISTING AND STAFFING DEVELOPMENT PLANS TO REACH OUR STATE WHY GOALS. WHAT THE MAY REVISE DOES IS ADD SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION SAYS GEORGE THIS IS JURISDICTIONS ELIGIBLE FOR PORTION OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS? THE MAY REVISE ALSO PROPOSES TO EXPAND STATE TAX CREDITS UP TO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY UP TO TWO HUNDRED OF THE NEWLY AUTHORIZED CREDITS WILL BE AVAILABLE TO INCREASE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MIXED INCOME HOUSING PROJECTS. SERVING A BROADER RANGE OF INCOMES UP TO A HUNDRED AND 20% OF THE A. M. I. AND WOULD ALLOW MORE TEACHERS ACCESS AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE SUPERINTENDENT IS ALSO VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE MAY REVISIONS PROPOSALS FOR EARLY LEARNING AND CARE. IN CLOSING WE'RE APPRECIATIVE OF THE POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE WITH THE COMMITTEE THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THROUGH THIS PROCESS. WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS RECOGNIZED AND SUPPORTED THE ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW AND EXISTING PROGRAMS AND HAVE PROVIDED POSITIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAMS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED PROPERLY. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION TO IRON OUT ANY DETAILS IN THE MAY REVISIONS. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU OF A FEW QUESTIONS BUT START OFF WITH COMMITTEE MEMBERS MR O'DONNELL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- AND THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS -- PERSONAL WITH REGARD TO PROP NINETY EIGHT THE CALL IS BEING DECREASED. FROM THREE POINT FOUR SIX TO THREE POINT TWO SIX IS THAT ACCURATE THAT'S CORRECT. IN WHY I FIND THAT UNFORTUNATE I THINK THAT BUYS IN TO THE IDEA. THAT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IS THE CEILING IS OPPOSE OF FLOOR THERE'S NOTHING THAT SAYS. WE CAN'T EVEN INCREASE IT MORE THAN THE PROPOSED NOW PROPOSES THREE POINT TWO SIX SO I JUST I JUST THINK THAT THAT'S UNFORTUNATE I THINK SHE WILL OF OF THREE POINT -- TWO SIX OKAY IF IT EATS INTO THE GENERAL FUND THAT GOES BEYOND THE CEILING I'M QUITE FINE WITHOUT I THINK EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM SHOULD BE FINE WITH THAT. BUT AGAIN WILL AND ONE THING ONLY COME FOR WHAT IS CONSISTENTLY IN THIS HEARING ROOM. FOLKS COME IN AND THEY THEY THEY CONSISTENTLY ACT. AS THOUGH PROPOSITION NINETY IS THE CEILING OPPOSED TO THE FLOOR SO THAT THAT'S THAT'S UNFORTUNATE -- SO IT'S I I WOULD SAY THAT'S A LESSER COMMITMENT. TO CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND A LESSER INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE WHEN WE WE WHEN WE WE WE DO THINGS LIKE THAT -- SOME OF THE QUESTIONS -- WELL LET'S TALK ABOUT SPECIAL EDUCATION THAT AT THIS PROPOSAL AS PROPOSED RIGHT NOW IS TOTALLY UNWORKABLE -- IT IS REALLY UNFORTUNATE -- IT [inaudible] IT. I I CANNOT SUPPORT IT IT WILL DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE AND THAT COULD EASE IN OUR SPECIAL EDUCATION FINANCE SYSTEM. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS A BEING FUNDED ADEQUATELY NOW WE'RE GONNA GO OUT ON I MEAN IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW YOUR HOUSE ON FIRE SOULS AND YOU DECIDE AT THE SAME TIME TO ADD ANOTHER ROOM. WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM THAT YOU HAVE NOW BEFORE YOU VENTURE INTO SOMETHING NEW. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS DOES. AGAIN IT DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF NOT ADEQUATELY FUNDING EXISTING SPECIAL ED. SERVICES AND IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THE PROPOSAL BENEFITS JUST A FEW DISTRICT I WOULD SAY JUST A FEW MANY DISTRICTS FOR SURE BUT NOT ENOUGH -- WE SHOULD REALLY ADDRESS EQUALIZATION. BEFORE WE LOOK AT AGAIN GOING INTO ANOTHER VENTURE OR MAYBE IS EQUALIZATION PLUS THIS YEAR PLEASE TAKE A STEP. THIS YOUR TOWARDS EQUALIZATION I GET WHAT'S GOING ON HERE WE ALL KNOW THIS IS ABOUT SOME DISTRICTS TEETERING. AND THAT THAT'S PROBABLY WHERE THE SAME BACK AND I THINK WE'RE WE MAY NEED TO ADDRESS THAT. CERTAINLY A THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS WITH THE SAME TIME WE NEED DRESS THE SPECIALIST SYSTEM ACROSS OUR STATE THIS PROPOSAL AS IT SITS COULD ACTUALLY. ACT AS A DISINCENTIVE TO SERVE STUDENTS -- BECAUSE THE WAY I SEE IT RIGHT NOW DISTRICTS THAT. THERE'S A LOT DISTRICTS THAT ARE INVESTING IN SPECIAL EDUCATION OUT OF AND ULTIMATELY THAT KEEPS OUR SPECIAL ED RATS LOW BECAUSE THEY'RE HELPING KIDS EARLY. THE CATCHING THEIR NEEDS EARLY AND IF THIS MAY ACT AS A DISINCENTIVE FOR DISTRICTS TO DO THAT I THINK THAT WOULD. HARM CHILDREN. IN OUR STATE AND CERTAINLY HARM US ON THE FISCAL FRONT. IN -- IN THE LONG RUN I MEAN THIS COULD DISCOURAGE EARLY INTERVENTION AND INCLUSION. S. OF ROSAL SITS TODAY. AND IT PUNISHES THE DISTRICTS THAT ARE A THAT ARE ENGAGED IN THAT ARE VERY PROACTIVE TODAY -- SO THAT THE THAT'S I HOPE THE COMMITTEE WILL TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT THAT PROPOSAL. BECAUSE AGAIN I IT'S IT'S JUST NOT WORKABLE. AND IT IS NOT THAT SOUND POLICY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE -- I KNOW MISTER MEDINA I DON'T LOSE YOUR HOUSE YOU MISTER MEDIAN I KNOW HAS A BILL THAT'S BEAST EQUALIZATION SO AGAIN I HOPE. EQUALIZATION IS A MAJOR PART OF THIS COMMITTEES CONVERSATION AS WE'VE FORMULATE OUR PROPOSAL -- AND ANOTHER QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- DATA SHOWS THAT SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS ATTRACT MORE LOW INCOME STUDENTS TO THE TEACHING FIELD BECAUSE LOW INCOME STUDENTS ARE RELUCTANT TO TAKE ON NEW LOANS. AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS FOCUSING ON LOAN FORGET LOAN FORGIVENESS. OVER SCHOLARSHIPS AND I DON'T KNOW IF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAD ANY COMMENT ON THAT. I JUST WONDER FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT IF WE SHOULD BE GOING TO THE PATH OF OF OF SCHOLARSHIPS AS OPPOSED TO LOAN FORGIVENESS DOES ANYONE WISH TO COMMENT ON I CAN I CAN NOT OPINE SPECIFICALLY. I DON'T COVER THAT THAT AREA I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE A BENEFICIAL COMMENT THAT'S OKAY. SO JUST REAL QUICK MISTER DONALD THAT IT'S KIND OF A HYBRID IT'S OF COURSE EDUCATION TEACHERS BUT THE PROPOSAL WAS IN THAT HIGHER ED STUDENT COMMISSIONS WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT TOMORROW. SOUNDS GOOD -- I JUST HAD A QUESTION ON THE BECOMING ON THE COMPUTER SCIENCE COORDINATOR MILLION DOLLARS FOR FOR ONE PERSON. IS THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE. THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE NO. I PERSONALLY DO NOT KNOW BUT MY COLLEAGUES WILL COME SHARE WITH US. GOOD MORNING KIMBERLY LEAHY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OF THE MILLION DOLLARS IS OVER FOUR YEARS FOR THE POSITION -- IT IS FOR THE POSITION TO BE A COORDINATOR AND A POINT PERSON IN THE IMPLEMENTATION THE COMPUTER SCIENCE -- PLANNED SO -- IT'S OVER OVER FOUR YEARS NOT ONE HERE. THANK YOU AGAIN AND I JUST A COMMENT FROM SOMEONE TO COME FROM THE GROUND -- SOMEONE HASN'T YOU KNOW BEEN OF THE CLASS FOR MANY YEARS. WE CREATE A LOT OF THINGS UP HERE IN SACRAMENTO THAT I DON'T KNOW THEY REALLY HAVE THE IMPACT THAT WE LIKE THEM HAVE THE LOCAL LEVEL CAN. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THEREFORE WE DO INCENTIVIZE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE PROBABLY WITH DOLLARS. DEVELOP THE CAPACITY TO TEACH THINGS LIKE COATING ON THE SECOND THIRD FOURTH AND BEYOND GRADES -- I I JUST WORRY SOMETIMES WERE DATA AND COORDINATORS ALSO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY REALLY MEAN. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE I REALLY THINK. THIS CAPACITY HAS TO BE DEVELOPED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND I'M I'M OT SURE THAT. JUST FUNNY OF COURTNEY -- WOULD DO THAT I THINK SETTING ASIDE YOU KNOW. SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ATTACK AGAIN DEVELOP THE CAPACITY TO TO DELIVER THIS EDUCATION THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH THE MONEY MUCH. BETTER SPENT THANK YOU AND JUST ONE OTHER COMMENT ON PROPOSITION -- SIXTY FOUR IS. WE WANT TO SEE I THE PROPOSAL -- SIX TO SEVEN EIGHTY POINT FIVE MILLION IN PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR FUNDS TO SUBSIDIZE CHILDCARE FOR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN AND I JUST WONDER. WHY WE PUSHING CHILD CARE -- MORE SO THAN THE OUR EXISTING ASUS PROGRAM. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHICH TO OPINE ON THE GOOD MORNING LISA RESIDENTS GIVE A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO IT'S NOT THAT IT'S NOT PUSHING A SAYS I THINK THE IDEA IS THAT. OTHER THOUGHT AS THE EARLIER INTERVENTION -- WITH REGARDS TO SUBSTANCE ABUSE WOULD BE MORE ADVANTAGEOUS. FOR ITS GLAZER ONE MORE TIME SO. THE PROPOSAL REALLY WASN'T FOR A SAYS IT'S A SEPARATE PROGRAM I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ASUS IS -- THE IDEA IS THAT THE EARLY INTERVENTION WITH REGARDS TO SETTING UP AS A CHILD SPACE -- WOULD LEAD TO BETTER OUTCOMES. SO WHETHER OR NOT -- SO WHAT WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO WITH THE MONEY. THEY'RE GOING TO PUT OUT MORE -- ALTERNATE PAYMENTS LOTS FOR STUDENTS APPROXIMATELY ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED SLOTS FOR STUDENTS FOR SLOTS FOR WHAT I'M SORRY FIRST FOR CHILDREN. FOR CHILDCARE PER CHILD CARE YES THEIR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN CORRECT. THE SO THE PROPOSAL IS CHANGED SLIGHTLY SINCE THE EIGHT PAGES AND AGAIN WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE CONFUSION. WITH THIS CHANGE THERE'S WHAT THERE IS MANY THINGS LOOKED AT WITH THIS FUNDING AND IT MOVED RATHER QUICKLY SO THE TALKING POINTS IN THE EIGHT PAGES ARE. NOT WHERE WE ARE AT THE PROPOSAL AT THIS POINT IN TIME SO THAT I'LL TURN IT SO I DON'T ASK HIM A QUESTION OF COMMON BECAUSE WHAT I HAVE IS HERE THAT IT'S EIGHTY POINT FIVE MILLION FROM PROP. SIXTY FOUR TO SUBSIDIZE CHILDCARE FOR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT SPECIFIC PROGRAM THEY WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT MAYBE THE CHAIRED AS BUT AGAIN I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WOULD BE BETTER FOLDED IN ASUS. I THAT THAT THAT'S KIND OF MY MY QUESTION A YOU KNOW THE ANSWER RIGHT NOW -- BUT THAT AND ONE DAUGHTER'S CLOTHES ON FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN SO THESE MISTER CHAIR -- THE PROPOSAL MAY BE A NET NEGATIVE FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO PARTICIPATE IN A THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN -- BECAUSE IT MAY IMPACT FUTURE ELIGIBILITY FOR STATE BOND FUNDS FOR SOME SOME LOCALS WHO DO. TAKE THAT MONEY -- SO THE DISINCENTIVE SHOULD BE CORRECTED THAT'S RETAIN -- THAT'S FOR APPLYING OR GETTING -- SOME OF THAT -- NOW 600- MILLION DOLLARS -- IN -- TO CONVERT THE CANDOR FACILITY FOR THAT I TURN IT BACK TO YOU MISTER. THANK YOU I KNOW WE HAVE A FEW OTHER QUESTIONS I JUST WANT TO JUMP RIGHT IN YOU CAN STICK STICK AROUND HERE FOR FOR THE PROP SIXTY FOUR I GUESS THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON ONE THE OBVIOUS THING. WHEN I VOTED FOR PROP SIXTY FOUR ANSWERED ALL OF YOU? WE THOUGHT TV COMMERCIALS IT SAID THREE THINGS WE SHOULD TAX MARIJUANA. WE SHOULD REGULATE MARIJUANA WE SHOULD USE THE MONEY FOR PROGRAMS LIKE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS IT WAS ON THE TV COMMERCIAL THE CAMPAIGN BROCHURE. THE BALLOT STATEMENT. WE LOVE CHILD CARE PROGRAMS BUT NOT ONCE DID WE TELL THE VOTERS. IT WOULD EXPAND CHILDCARE PROGRAM SO THAT'S I THINK A BIG PROBLEM WITH WHAT WE TOLD THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA -- NUMBER ONE WE SHOULD LOOK AT EXPANDING -- CHILDCARE SLOTS INCLUDING A PIECE LOTS IN OUR OVERALL BUDGET BUT I THINK WE'RE PRETTY CLEAR WITH THE ELECTORATE WHAT THAT WAS FOR AND I THINK IT'S DISINGENUOUS. AND THEN TO THE SECOND ISSUE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT REVISED NAY REVISED PROPOSAL. IS NOT GOING TO LOOK AT SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN IN CHILD CARE BUT THE EIGHT P. VOUCHERS LOTS WITH OUR WHICH ARE PREDOMINATELY LITTLE KIDS AND I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU DO DRUG INTERVENTION WITH. TWO AND THREE YEAR OLDS MOST OF THOSE AFTER MOSTLY EFFORTS FOR THEIR YOU WOULD THINK ARE FOR OLDER KIDS WHICH IS WHY. THE ASUS PROGRAM MAKES SO MUCH SENSE THOSE OF THE POPULATION WERE KIDS ARE MOST AT RISK WITH DABBLING WITH. DRUGS AND ALCOHOL CERTAINLY YOU KNOW VAPING AND SO FORTH AND THAT THE WHEEL HOUSE OF THAT. IS OF COURSE -- KIDS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND MIDDLE SCHOOL SO IT JUST -- DOESN'T MAKE SENSE SINCE WILL HAVE SOME -- CONCERNS WITH THAT -- WE TURN IT BACK -- TO MISTER MARTUCCI AND THEN MISTER GALLAGHER I'LL COME BACK SOME OTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. SO I I FEELING A REAL DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND WHAT I'M HEARING FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW WE JUST CAME IN THIS YEAR WE SAW THE LOS ANGELES TEACHERS STRIKE. WHERE YOU KNOW OVERWHELMING -- NUMBERS OF OF LOS ANGELES RESIDENTS RECOGNIZED. THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE WOEFULLY UNDERFUNDED AND THAT IS THIS WAS IS IS TRANSLATING INTO THE AT THE THAT THE CLASS SIZES THE LACK OF CANCERS A LACK OF NURSES -- IN IN IN IN OUR SCHOOLS. AND THEN WE MOVED TO OAKLAND AND WE HAVE THE TEACHERS STRIKE RAISING THE SAME ISSUES HIGHLIGHTED THE FACT THAT STATE FUNDING IS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE. FOR OUR SCHOOLS AND THEN NOW WE ARE TURNING TO SACRAMENTO WHERE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT LAYING OFF TEACHERS AGAIN BECAUSE THE WOEFULLY INADEQUATE STATE FUNDING. YOU KNOW I'M I'M READING THIS OP ED THAT WAS JUST IN THE LOS ANGELES TIMES. THAT -- THAT TALKS ABOUT HOW. IN NEW YORK CITY SCHOOLS SPEND MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND PER PUPIL IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN BOSTON SCHOOL SPENT MORE THAN TWENTY TWO THOUSAND I NEED STUDENT. LOS ANGELES SCHOOLS IN CONTRAST SPENT ABOUT THIRTEEN THOUSAND PER STUDENT. THEY THEY OP ED GOES ON THE EXPLANATION FOR THIS GLARING THIS DISCREPANCY AMONG THE DISTRICTS OBVIOUSLY ISN'T THAT LOS ANGELES STUDENTS HAVE YOUR NEEDS. THE REASON FOR THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT CALIFORNIA ROUTINELY UNDER FUNDS AS PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHEN THE COST OF LIVING IS FACTORED IN CALIFORNIA CONSISTENTLY RANKS AMONG THE BOTTOM TEN STATES IN PER PEOPLE'S. EXPENDITURES AND SO YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN SAYING OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT YOU KNOW. CALIFORNIA IS UNDER FUNDING AT SCHOOL I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THE CHAIR OF THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE THAT WE'RE TREATING PROPOSITION. NINETY NINETY EIGHT L. AS A AS A CEILING RATHER THAN A FLOOR AND WE NEED TO STOP TALKING ABOUT HOW WE ARE YOU KNOW A BENCH. OUR OUR PROGRESS BY PROP NINETY EIGHT BECAUSE PROBLEM NINETY EIGHT IS THE FLOOR SO. YOU KNOW AND THEN WHEN I SEE THE BUDGET PROPOSAL NOTICING THE SAME THING THAT MR O'DONNELL DID WERE ACTUALLY GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION IN TERMS OF THE THE LCF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA COLA ADJUSTMENT WE'RE GOING. FROM WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO A LOWER NUMBER FROM -- THAT THE GOVERNOR IS A JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL. AND WHAT ARE WE TALKING TO THE SAME PEOPLE ARE WE SEEING THE SAME THINGS HAPPENING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA [inaudible] YOU KNOW. VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA CONSISTENTLY SAY THAT EDUCATION IS OUR NUMBER ONE BUDGET PRIORITY AND YOU WE WE WE WE PAT OURSELVES ON THE BACK YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN WE SAY THAT WE'RE WE'RE SPENDING MORE ON ON K. THROUGH TWELVE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. BUT WE SHOULD NOT BE MEASURING OUR PROGRESS BY THIS THIS MINIMUM GUARANTEE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT IT IS IS THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED. AND I'M SICK AND TIRED OF OU KNOW -- OF OF THESE BUDGETS THAT -- THAT THAT IS UNDER FUNDING OUR STATE SCHOOLS THE BLAME IS ON US. YOU KNOW SHAME ON US FOR UNDER FUNDING OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING A LOS ANGELES THAT'S WERE SEEN OAKLAND OUTSOURCING SACRAMENTO AND THAT THAT'S WERE SEEING THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO MISTER CHAIR I AM NOT INCLINED TO SUPPORT -- THIS BUDGET I ALSO SHARE THE MISTER DONALD CONCERNS ABOUT THE SPECIALIST CATION I THINK. THE EQUALIZATION SHOULD BE OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING. OUR SPECIAL EDUCATION -- CHALLENGES I DO APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S. YOU KNOW OF A PROPOSALS -- TO TO TO TO HELP OUR SCOOL DISTRICTS IN IN TERMS OF OUR PENSION OBLIGATIONS. BUT YOU KNOW WE WE NEED WE NEED. TO WE NEED TO FEEL THE URGENCY THAT WE'RE SEEING IN OUR IN OUR IN OUR DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE NEED TO REALLY STEP UP OUR COMMITMENT. TO TO OUR K. THROUGH -- TWELVE FUNDING. OKAY THANK YOU WELL SAID MISTER MURATSUCHI. MISTER GALLAGHER. I MEAN A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS COVERED AND SOLVED TRY NOT. TO REITERATE I THINK WITH MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY SAID BUT I I THINK THE BIGGEST THING FOR ME IS. IN THE SPECIAL EDUCATION FRONT I MEAN MY COLLEAGUES -- FROM LONG BEACH PUT IT VERY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WE'RE CONTINUE TO DO HERE IS JUST ADD ANOTHER ANOTHER ROOM WHILE THE HOUSE IS ON FIRE -- AND AND I I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE CAN AT LEAST MOVE TOWARDS -- EQUALIZATION FUNDING IN SOME WAY YOU KNOW EVEN IF IT'S NOT FULL LEGALIZATION WE CAN START MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- ANY OF THE LA OWES REPORT I THINK JUST LAID IT OUT EXACTLY ALL THE PROBLEMS YOU'RE ALLOCATING FUNDS ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. PENALIZES DISTRICTS IT SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS THAT REDUCE THE NEED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES DOES THAT ARE. DOING EARLY INTERVENTION AND AND HAVING SUCCESS -- THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME TO BE THE RIGHT APPROACH A NEW CATEGORICAL PROGRAM WITHOUT EVEN MORE COMPLEXITY. TO THE STATE'S EXISTING PATCHWORK OF SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS. EXACTLY YEAH AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE TRYING TO SAY LET'S GO TO OTHER ALTERNATIVES YOU KNOW. SUCH AS FUNDING EQUALIZATION WOULD DISTRIBUTE THE FUNNY MORE BROADLY AND REDUCE THE HISTORICAL FUNDING INEQUITIES WITHOUT CREATING FISCAL INCENTIVES. IT FISCAL INCENTIVES TO KEEP STUDENTS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION. MAN I WOULD NOTICE MEETING WAS SO MYSELF AS HERE LOCALLY I MEAN A LOT OF THESE SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS ARE NOT JUST DEALING WITH KIDS. WITH THE CANNOT JUST BE HELPFUL THE KIDS THAT ARE IN I. E. PEAS. THEY CAN BE HELPFUL KIDS OR DEAL WITH A LOT OTHER ISSUES. MENTAL HEALTH. OTHER THINGS THAT WERE SEEN IN A IN OURS IN OUR SCHOOLS -- YOU KNOW SO LOOK I JUST THINK THIS IS THE COMPLETE WRONG APPROACH. AND YOU KNOW I'M REALLY HOPING THAT YOU KNOW I I I FEEL LIKE THAT'S THE TENOR OF THIS COMMITTEE. AND AND I THINK ALSO ON THE SENATE SIDE IS THAT WE PUSH FORWARD. TOWARDS MORE OF A OF A EQUALIZATION FUNDING -- METHOD -- AND SO I AM HOPING THAT WE CA DO THAT I WOULD ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT. YOU KNOW MY COLLEAGUE MADE. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT WHY NOT FOCUS ON ACES I MEAN ACES WE WERE JUST HAD A MEETING ON THIS. HEARING ON THIS LAST WEEK -- WHERE WE TALKED ABOUT THESE GREAT PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE ASUS FUNDING -- AND I FEEL LIKE WE'RE SORT OF SHORT CHANGING THAT AND I THINK WE HAVE. TO I REALIZE THAT THE CHILD CARE DISCUSSION KINDA GETS CAUGHT UP IN THE IN THE PRE K. AND AND BUT THEY ARE DIFFERENT. THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS YOU KNOW AND I I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT EDUCATION AS CHILD CARE. NECESSARILY RIGHT -- AND AND MAYBE THAT'S SORT OF THE PROBLEM LIKE. WE ARE EXPECTING MORE MORE MORE OF OUR TEACHERS AND EDUCATORS TO DO THINGS THAT REALLY ARE. NOT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND AND IT'S EXPENSIVE FOR THEM TO DO ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS. AND SO. I THINK WE NEED TO REALLY WORK ON HOW WE SEPARATE THAT OUT A LITTLE BIT CERTAINLY THERE'S THERE IS THERE IS A NEED FOR WORKING PARENTS. CHILD CARE COSTS ARE EXTREMELY HIGH -- YOU KNOW TO TO FIGURE THAT. YOU KNOW TO HAVE SOME RESOURCES THERE BUT I DON'T WANNA MAKE SET UP WITH WHAT ARE LEGITIMATE. WHAT WHAT WHAT? THE FOCUS OF OUR BUT IT SHOULD BE WHICH IS EDUCATING. OUR KIDS AND ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE THE TOOLS TO SUCCEED -- AND THAT THAT'S WHERE OUR EDUCATION DOLLARS HAVE TO BE FOCUSED THEY HAVE TO BE FOCUSED ON THAT. ON THAT EFFORT AND SO -- YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE MY COMMENTS AND BUT THAT'LL JUST TURNED BACK TO THE CHAIR [inaudible] THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT TO MY JOB IN A COUPLE THESE THESE ISSUES TO AN AND MAY BE ALLOWED DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO I'M ON THE SPECIAL AT I CONCUR THAT IT'S AN ISSUE THAT. WE NEED TO ADDRESS AND PUT MORE RESOURCES INTO AND WE WE HAD A A OP INFORMATIONAL HEARING ABOUT THIS -- LAST I THINK TWO YEARS IN A ROW NOW. AND HERE FOR FROM DISTRICTS ALL OUR DOWNSTATE AND THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS AND SPECIAL THAT ARE GOING UP AS ARE THE COSTS OF THE THE ATTENTION THIS IS IMPORTANT. BUT THE REMEDY IN THE PROPOSAL JUST ISN'T FAIR -- IT LOOKS LIKE IT HELPS LOS ANGELES SIGNIFICANTLY AND THEY LIKE THE PROPOSAL AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE HURTING. BUT A LOT OF OTHER DISTRICTS ARE HURTING AS WELL. SO WANTED TO GIVE YOU THE CHANCE YOU HEARD ALL OF OUR MEMBERS -- TALK ABOUT THIS AND A WHAT ARE WE MISSING HERE AND AND WHY WON'T YOU CONSIDER THE EQUALIZATION APPROACH AS OPPOSED. TO THE PROPOSAL IN THE BUDGET SO FIRST OF ALL LET ME WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERNS AND WE HAVE BEEN AN ONGOING CONVERSATIONS I WILL CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION OUTGOING THIS PROPOSAL REALLY IS DEDICATED. TO ADDRESS SEEN -- KIND OF EQUITY ISSUES IN A SPECIAL EDUCATION AND ITS TARGETS THE HIGH -- IMPACT AREAS SUCH AS YOUR LOW INCOME SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS SIR. AND THE FUNDING IS DEDICATED REALLY TOOK TRYING. TO PROVIDE MORE FUNDING FOR EARLY INTERVENTION FOR THE STUDENTS THERE AREN'T THAT TEND TO HAVE MORE AND HIGHER NEEDS MAYBE NOT NECESSARILY SPECIAL EDUCATION NEEDS BUT IT COULD LEAD TO SPECIAL EDUCATION. I'M AND IMPROVED OUTCOMES IS IS OUR THOUGHT. IT IS CERTAINLY NOT THAT WEREN'T. EQUITY A GIVE EQUALIZATION IS NOT PART OF OUR CONVERSATION BECAUSE WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT NOT ALL DISTRICTS BENEFIT FROM EQUALIZATION -- BUT WE DO THINK THAT WE'RE WE'RE WILLING TO HAVE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH REGARDS TO THE FORMULA. YEAH. I THINK AND THINKING ABOUT THE OVERALL PROP NINETY EIGHT ISSUE. I CONCUR WITH OUR EDUCATION CHAIR MISTER O'DONNELL. IN MISTER MARTUCCI WHOSE LEAD IN THAT CONVERSATION ON TAKING A LOOK AT LCF AFFAN ITS ADEQUACY. AND THERE RIGHT IT'S IT'S A DISGRACE THAT WORD WOEFULLY UNDER FUNDING OUR SCHOOLS -- FORTY FIRST THE NATION CERTAINLY SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS COULD MAKE BETTER DECISIONS MY OWN DISTRICT RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO. I THINK THEY MADE -- SOME REALLY TERRIBLE BUDGET DECISIONS TO GET IN THIS PROBLEM AND THEY NEED OWN TO BALANCING THEIR CHECKBOOK RIGHT OR WRONG BUT THE BIG PICTURE IS THAT. WE ARE STARVING OUR OUR DISTRICTS WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR HIGH COST OF LIVING AND WHAT THE TEACHERS NEED TO GET TO MAKE A LIVING WE SAW THE ARTICLE FEW WEEKS GO IN THAT. AREA AND TEACHERS THERE -- THEY CAN EVEN. IF THEY CAME TO LIVE OUTSIDE OF THEIR YOU KNOW GRANDMA'S HOUSE SIR. JOINING UP AS YOU SAID KITE YOU KNOW THREE AND FOUR TEACHERS PER AN APARTMENT AND THAT'S WHY IT COSTS SO MUCH. TO TO RUN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND IN SO MANY THEIR COUNTIES ACROSS THIS GUY. SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA NOT TO MENTION YOU KNOW ALL THE OTHER FIXED COSTS WITH -- RETIREMENT AND HEALTH CARE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT I THINK MORE THAN JUST THIS BUDGET BUT THE TECH TALK IN THE VOTERS BECAUSE I I DON'T THINK WE CAN COMPLAIN ABOUT WILL FULLY -- FUNDING OUR SCHOOLS. AND HAVE THE FUNDING ABOUT HALF OF WHAT YOU SAID NEW YORK AND MASSACHUSETTS HAVE. NOT BE WILLING TO GO TO THEM AND SAYING WHAT YOU WILLING TO PAY YOU CAN HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. SO I THINK WE NEED TO DO THAT AND AN UPCOMING BALLOT BUT THE PROBLEM. IS TODAY AND TODAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET. AND I I THINK IT'S SO HARD FOR THE AVERAGE VOTER TO UNDERSTAND CONSTITUENTS UNDERSTAND THAT WE HEAR ABOUT THIS TWENTY PLUS. BILLION DOLLARS SURPLUS GRANTED MAJORITY OF IT IS ONE TIME. AND I KNOW THE GOVERNOR RIGHTFULLY HAS TRIED AT THE SAYING WE'VE INCREASED FUNDING. THE LAST FIVE YEARS BY 50% THIS HIGHEST AMOUNT OF FUNDING CALIFORNIA HISTORY YOU KNOW TELL THAT TO DISTRICTS ARE SENDING OUT PINK SLIPS TODAY. IT DOESN'T REALLY HELP THEM AND SO WITH ALL WE HAVE AN ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S -- A PRIORITIES -- THIS IS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THIS DOES NOT LOOK LIKE IT'S BEING ADEQUATELY -- PRIORITIZED AND SO THAT IS -- GREATLY DISAPPOINTING AND CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WORK ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS AS WE CLOSE OUT -- THE BUDGET -- THIS YEAR. THAT'S KIND OF MORE OF A COMMENTARY NOT NOT A QUESTION THERE. I DID WANT -- TO ALSO ASK ABOUT THE WHO WHO WAS WHICH YOU TALKED ABOUT THE THE ECM PROJECTS THAT YOU. I'M INTERESTED WHAT WHAT WHAT. YEAH SEPARATE QUESTIONS. GOTCHA GOTCHA. YES SO IN THE PROPOSAL YOU YOU THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF SLOTS AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE BE CHANGED. THE THE OUT YEAR AS YOU ACTUALLY YEAH YEAH THE I'M YOU CHANGE THE OUT YEAR AND THAT THE PRESCHOOL FOR ALL KIND OF PROMISE SO -- WHY IS IT NECESSARY -- TO TO ADDRESS THAT IN THIS YEAR'S -- BUDGET CONCLUSION WHEN IT'S REALLY KIND OF AN OUT YEAR CONVERSATION AND COMMITMENT. SO I APOLOGIZE SO YOU'RE WONDERING WHY WE REMOVETHE TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR SO WITH PART OF THE AS YOU KNOW BUDGETING BALANCING THE BUDGET IS NOT A ONE YEAR -- COMMITMENT IT'S IT'S OUT SEVERAL YEARS FIVE YEARS I BELIEVE AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE NOTICED AS WE GOT THE NOON ECONOMIC INDICATORS IS THAT REVENUES ARE DROPPING MORE SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE OUT YEARS THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED. SO IN ORDER TO BALANCE THE BUDGET IN THE OUT YEARS WE WE REMOVE THE SLOTS NOT NECESSARILY THE COMMITMENT TO THE SPOTS BUT WE REMOVE THE FUNDING. IN ORDER TO KIND OF RE GAUGING NEXT YEAR WITH THE NEW ECONOMIC INDICATORS ON HOW MUCH THE STATE CAN AFFORD GOING FORWARD SO THERE IS A COMMITMENT -- INTO IT WOULD GET TO UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL WE ALSO ARE HOPING THAT THE MASTER PLAN THAT'S BEEN UP PROPOSED WILL ALSO GIVE US A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THE PRESCHOOL ARE THE SLOTS THAT ARE NEEDED IN THE STATE. IT MAY BE T. K. IT MAY BE -- ZERO FOUR ZERO TO FIVE OTHER AREAS SO I THINK ALL IDEAS WE NEED A NEEDS ASSESSMENT IN THE STATE ON EARLY LEARNING IN THIS AREA WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN BETTER FUND IT WITH NOT. ONLY GENERAL FUND BUT LEVERAGING OTHER RESOURCES WITHIN THE STATE -- AND IN DETERMINING WHAT POCKETS THE STATE THAT DID THAT OF SORTS THAT ARE USUALLY SPOKE UP NEED THIS THE MOST SO. IT'S NOT THE COMMITMENT. THAT'S BEEN REMOVED IT'S JUST REALLY AT STEPPING BACK AND TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT'S THE STATE CAN AFFORD TO DO GOING FORWARD AND AS FAR AS THE THE ACES CONVERSATION THE AFTER SCHOOL -- PROGRAM -- ONE I KNOW THAT THE STATE LAST COUPLE YEARS HAS TAKEN A LOOK AT ISSUES LIKE. I TO ASSESS AND HOME CARE INDUSTRY -- CERTAINLY ARE EARLY EDUCATION OUR OUR OUR OUR PRESCHOOL AND AND CHILD CARE WORK FORCE. AND REALIZE THAT COSTS HAVE GONE UP CITIES HAVE ENACTED MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES CALIFORNIA. HAS IT AS WELL. AND YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T INCREASE -- REV IF YOU INCREASE THE RESOURCES FOR THE PROGRAM SIDE TO SIMPLE LAWS OF MATHEMATICS AND THE YOUR FEET YOU'LL SIR FEWER KIDS SO HOW DO YOU ATTEMPT TO RECONCILE THAT. WITH OUR STATE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM. AND WE HEARD FROM THEM A FEW WEEKS AGO SAYING THAT -- YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING -- TO DECREASE THE NUMBER OF KIDS SERVICE IN OUR COMMUNITY SAID THAT. WON'T HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT FOR FOR FAMILIES FOR STUDENTS SHE MEANT. FOR PUBLIC SAFETY HAZARD FROM ALL OVER ADVOCATE SOME. WHAT IS THAT WE HAVE ALSO HEARD FROM THE UP THE KIDS AND WE DO APPRECIATE AND AND RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM IT'S ALSO A PROGRAM THAT'S LEVERAGED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IT'S IT'S SHOULD BE A LOCAL PRIORITY TO HAVE HELP? FUND THESE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS THAT THAT WAS ALWAYS MEANT TO BE THE STATE CONTRIBUTION WAS ONLY A PORTION OF THE FULL FUNDING -- BUT AGAIN IT'S IT'S A MATTER OF LIMITED ON GOING FUNDING AND THE ABILITY TO TAKE THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS THEY REQUEST. UP AWAY FROM SOMEONE ELSE THAT ALSO PROBABLY NEED THAT SO I I MEAN THAT'S THE SITUATION AND AS YOU GO TO BALANCE THE BUDGET YOU'RE PUTTING TOGETHER YOUR FOURTH YOUR PROPOSAL YOU WILL. YOU WILL COME ACROSS THE SAME AND WE KNOW THAT AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS OUR CHILD CARE FOR A LOT. BROWNLEE -- THAT THE PARTICIPANTS IN THOSE PROGRAMS I JUST WONDER IF YOU CAN ADDRESS THE FACT THAT AS I SAID A FEW TIMES BEFORE WHEN WE CAMPAIGNED ON THIS WHEN. FRANKLY THE GOVERNOR WAS THE LEADER IN THIS CAMPAIGN PROP. SIXTY FOUR HE TALKED ABOUT AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND I BROUGHT THE TV COMMERCIAL HERE. LAST HEARING AND I READ THE BALLOT STATEMENT. I READ THE THE BALLOT ARGUMENTS AND IT SAID AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND NEVER SAID. CHILD CARE INFANT TODDLER PROGRAMS WHICH ARE IMPORTANT I DON'T WANT TO MISS THOSE SO. HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT THAT THE PROMISE TO THE ELECTORATE IS -- A YEAR AND A HALF LATER AND KIND OF IGNORED. SO I BELIEVE THAT THE USE WITH THE APS LOTS DOES FIT THE WORDING MAYBE NOT THE TELEVISION COMMERCIALS BUT IF YOU READ THE ACTUAL PROPOSITION SCHOOL RETENTION. OF IMPROVED OUTCOMES YOU KNOW. ADDRESSED IT LOWER IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE ARE ALL PART OF IT -- SO WE DO THINK THAT THE AP AND GIVING THE SLOTS. TOO YOUNG FAMILIES AND HELPING THE BASE OF THAT FAMILY -- HAVE BETTER CIRCUMSTANCES AS HELPFUL A LOT OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE IS ACTUALLY DEVELOPED OVER THE DEEPER CALAMITY FOR IT IS. EARLY IN AGE -- SO WHERE DOES IT TELL YOU ANYTHING -- AS THEIR CATCHER AND TAKING TO PROGRAMS AGAINST EACH OTHER READ THE AT THE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM OR SAYING WHAT ABOUT US. AND WE DON'T WANT TO THROW. YOU KNOW THE A. P. AND CHILD CARE. FAMILIES UNDER THE BUS AND SO WE REALLY ARE COUNTING ON ON THE BUDGET TO VALUE BOTH OF THESE. AND SO THAT'S THE DISAPPOINTING THING IS YOU KNOW WE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE. LOOKING AT THE BAD GUYS SOLUTION HERE AND CAN PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS WHEN -- I THINK THAT -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT. PROP SIXTY FOUR TALK ABOUT AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. THEY HAD ONE WORDS ON THE TV COMMERCIAL ONE SLOGAN. A ONE WORD AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS NOTHING ELSE -- OKAY YES -- ONE MORE QUESTION FOR THE FOR THE LA -- SO YOUR REVENUE PROJECTIONS WERE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN THE NUMBERS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND IN ORDER STANDING AT DOESN'T HAVE MUCH OF AN IMPACT ON SCHOOLS AND AND PROP NINETY EIGHT CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THAT A LITTLE BIT. SURE I'LL DO MY BEST I THINK THERE MIGHT BE YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE STILL KIND OF WORKING WITH. THE ADMINISTRATION AND WE THINKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES AND WHY THEY ARE BUT I THINK ONE FACTOR IS THAT WE WE PREPARE OUR ESTIMATES A LITTLE BIT LATER THAN THE ADMINISTRATION SO WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT BETTER DATA MORE RECENT DATA ON WHAT HAPPENED IN APRIL IN SOME OF THE MORE. RECENT I TAX COLLECTIONS AND WE CAN INCORPORATE THAT IN OUR OUTLOOK. WE ALSO I THINK ANOTHER FACTOR IS -- ALL THESE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF CALIFORNIA BASED COMPANIES IT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT KIND OF REVENUE BUMP FROM THAT WE JUST HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF MODELING AT I THINK OUR IS. KIND OF MODEL ASSUMES A LITTLE BIT MORE SLIGHTLY MORE REVENUE FROM THOSE KINDS OF OFFERINGS -- SO WE'RE STILL KIND OF WORKING TO MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE PIECES -- BUT WE THINK THOSE TWO ARE PART OF IT AND IN KIND OF THE BROADER ECONOMIC OUTLOOK WE ARE VERY SIMILAR -- I THINK FOR LIKE THE REVENUE THAT AFFECTS PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT OR MAYBE TWO HUNDRED MILLION. BELOW THE ADMINISTRATION AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FOUR HUNDRED MILLION PER YEAR ABOVE THEM AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN NINETEEN TWENTY YOU KNOW THE CONTEXT OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY BILLION IN GENERAL FUND REVENUE THAT'S THAT'S ABOUT AS CLOSE AS YOU'RE LIKELY TO SEE IN A IN TWO DIFFERENT OUTLOOKS. OKAY THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER LIMA. I THINK I JUST WANTED TO CHIME IN -- AS THE VICE CHAIR OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS ON THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE KIND OF PITTING. OF EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE US LOTS WITH AFTER SCHOOL SLOTS -- AND WHILE. I THINK THAT THE THERE HAS BEEN JUSTIFICATION MADE THAT LEGALLY THE BALLOT LANGUAGE ALLOWS FOR THAT I THINK THAT IT'S NOT IN THE SPIRIT OF WHAT OUR PARTNERS -- NINE AND ALSO WHAT THE PUBLIC THINKS AND SO I WOULD ASKS FOR RECONSIDERATION ON THAT FACT I GET IT. YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN PART OF BALLOT INITIATIVES AS WELL AND WE CAN LEGALLY JUSTIFY THEM BUT IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS THE CONVERSATION WITH OUR PARTNERS IN BOTH -- EARLY CHILDHOOD AT CARE -- SPOTS AS WELL AS AFTER SCHOOL SPOTS HAS. CLEARLY I THINK REFLECTED THE HEADING OF EACH OTHER -- AND I WOULD HOPE THAT. WE CAN FIND WAYS TO WORK TOGETHER AND MAKE THESE DECISIONS COLLECTIVELY BUT I HOPE THAT THAT MESSAGES UNDERSTOOD THAT OUR PARTNERS WHO GO OUT WITH US TO GET BALLOTS PASSED. TO MOVE INITIATIVES FORWARD TO FIND AND IDENTIFY -- FUNDING -- SHOULDN'T BE PITTED AGAINST EACH OTHER IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS -- I THINK IT TOOK THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS -- OFF GUARD A BIT THAT IT WAS DONE SO IN SUCH A WAY AND I GET IT LEGALLY WE CAN DO IT BECAUSE THE BALLOT INITIATIVES ARE PURPOSELY RATE AND IN VEGAS AND YOU KNOW BROAD LANGUAGE TO BE HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY -- BUT IN TERMS OF OUR LONG. TERM PARTNERSHIP A THINK IT'S GOING CAUSE BIGGER PROBLEMS SO -- THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE HAPPENING AS I SPEAK BETWEEN PARTNERS -- BETWEEN MEMBERS OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS -- IN BOTH HOUSES BUT I I HOPE THAT IT'S UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS IS REALLY A CHALLENGE -- FOR BOTH HOUSES. FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO MAKE IT REAL VERY CLEAR THAT IT WAS NOT THE INTENT OF THIS ADMINISTRATION TO PET ANYONE AGAINST ONE ANOTHER FOR WITH THESE -- WITH THIS PROPOSAL AND CERTAINLY -- WE HAVE ALSO HEARD YOUR CONCERNS VERY STRONGLY OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS AND WITH THE IN JOINT ONGOING CONVERSATION TO RECTIFY. THANK YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI ONCE AGAIN. THANK YOU I WANT TO COME BACK TO MY FAVORITE TOPIC THERE'S TALK ABOUT EARLIER -- SO. I KNOW YOU ARE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE -- TO REPRESENT THE GOVERNOR -- BUT IS THE GOVERNOR COMFORTABLE WITH CALIFORNIA BEING FORTY FOURTH IN THE NATION IN PER PEOPLE SPENDING. I THINK. I THINK I WOULD JUST. COMMENT AND SAY I MEAN WE WE HAD A PER PUPIL FUNDING HEARING HERE I BELIEVE EARLIER THIS YEAR -- TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW A LOT OF THOSE RANKINGS. SOME TAKEN BECAUSE LIVING SOME DON'T -- I THINK WE'RE NOT REALLY IN A POSITION -- TO PINUS THAT BECAUSE REALLY THE MOST RECENT DATA WITH ALL THE RECENT INFLUX IS AN FUNDING UNDER THE LC FF. REALLY HAVING TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT YET WHEN TO COME UP -- QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY AS YOU HEARD US IN THE ALLEY -- SHARE -- THAT HEARING I MENTIONED SO -- I THINK AT THIS POINT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A POSITION OUR COMMENT TO THAT QUESTION DIRECTLY. OKAY WELL I I I'VE BEEN. RIGHT I STARTED HERE IN IN IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND I KNOW THAT -- EVER SINCE AROUND -- TWENTY TWELVE WE I I BELIEVE THE STATE HAS -- RESTORED OVER THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AND AND AND K. THROUGH TWELVE FUNDING. AND YET I'VE I'VE NEVER SEEN CALIFORNIA MOVE HIGHER THAN I THINK MAYBE FORTY FIRST IN THE NATION IN PER PUPIL SPENDING. YOU KNOW TAKING THE EDUCATION WEEKLY NUMBERS ADJUSTING FOR COST OF LIVING WHICH I THINK REFLECTS THE THE REALITY OF LIVING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- ASSUMING THAT WE ARE AND THE AND THE AT BEST IN THE BOTTOM HALF A RATHER THAN -- YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT THE LOS ANGELES TIMES SO CITED IN THERE OUGHT EDITORA EARLIER IN IN TERMS OF THE DRAMATICALLY HIGHER PER PEOPLE SPENDING THAT WE'RE SEEING -- AND STATES -- YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY THOSE ON THE EAST COAST DOES THE GOVERNOR HAVE A PLAN ON HOW TO INCREASE CALIFORNIA'S PER PEOPLE SPENDING. I WOULDN'T SAY IT AT THIS POINT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A SPECIFIC PLAN IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW MAYBE A WAY TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL REVENUES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT -- NOW -- BUT THAT IS CERTAINLY. PART OF THE CONVERSATION WE TALK ABOUT COMPARING OTHER STATES IS THAT CALIFORNIA. WELL WE'RE UNIQUE IN A IN A LOT OF WAYS BUT ALSO JUST OUR MIX OF PROPERTY TAX IN GENERAL FUND THAT GOES TOWARDS. FUNDING EDUCATION VERSUS STATES LIKE NEW YORK IT IT'S A WHOLE OTHER THE RATIO IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WHILE THESE OTHER STATES SO I JUST COMMENT THAT BUT BUT IN ANSWER QUESTIONS NOW. DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DISPUTE THESE NUMBERS THAT ARE CITED BY THE LOS ANGELES TIMES AT IN NEW YORK CITY SCHOOL SPENT MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND PER PEOPLE. BOSTON SPENT MORE THAN TWENTY TWO THOUSAND PER STUDENT. WELL WE'RE AS IN COMPARISON LOS ANGELES -- AT LEAST UNDER THE LCF APHID IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S INCREASED ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND BUT STILL -- DATE DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DISPUTE THAT THAT -- JUST TAKING THOSE THREE CITIES AS AN EXAMPLE THAT WE ARE THAT THE THAT THESE -- FIGURES ARE MORE OR LESS ACCURATE. I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM PERSONALLY SO I CAN'T REALLY SAY BUT I KNOW LOOKING AT RANKINGS TYPICALLY NEW YORK IS IS VERY HIGH SO IT DOESN'T SOUND -- ON REASONABLE I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SAY. OUR THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU THIS IS INFORMATIONAL TODAY WE WILL NOT BE. TAKING ANY ACTIONS. WE NOW WILL. THANK YOU CAN BE DISMISSED PLEASE. I WILL NOW PROCEED WITH PUBLIC COMMENTS. THE PLEASE LINE UP IN THE MIDDLE. THANK YOU START. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS RON RAP ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS A VERY GOOD CONVERSATION THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENTS -- IT WE CERTAINLY DO APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR PROVIDING ADDITIONAL DOLLARS TO PUBLIC EDUCATION HOWEVER -- ALL OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS BROUGHT THIS POINT UP THAT WE ARE STILL. IN THE BOTTOM -- TEN STATES IN TERMS OF PER PUPIL FUNDING THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS IN THE BUDGET THE MAY REVISE THAT WE DO LIKE -- WE DO LIKE THE ADDITION OF THE CAL STIRS CONTRIBUTION -- THE THREE POINT ONE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS WILL CERTAINLY HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- WE WOULD LIKE. TO REQUEST THAT THE ASSEMBLY LOOK AT PROVIDING ADDITIONAL DOLLARS IN TERMS OF PAYING DOWN THE LIABILITY FOR CALPERS AS WELL WE LIKE THE TEACHER SERVICE CREDIT SCHOLARSHIP OF EIGHTY NINE POINT NINE MILLION. WE LIKE THE TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TRAINING WE SHARE CONCERNS WITH THE SPECIAL EDUCATION -- DISTRIBUTION MODEL WE THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE -- REVISITED WE SUPPORT EQUALIZATION -- IN TERMS OF THE RAINY DAY FINE WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED TO PUT THOSE DOLLARS INTO. THE RAINY DAY FUND BUT WE WE THINK THAT'S A BIT PROBLEMATIC I THINK IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR SCHOOLS TO ACCESS THOSE DOLLARS -- AND THEY'RE COUNTED AGAINST OUR PROP NINETY EIGHT ALLOCATION. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY THANK YOU AND JUST FOR THE CALPERS. QUESTION YOU'RE ASKED ABOUT THIS TO BUY DOWN FOR CALPERS JUST FOR EDUCATION. CORRECT YES THANK YOU.

AB FIRST I WANT TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE THAT -- MISTER O'DONNELL RAISED REGARDING THE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM -- THE INCREASE STATE MATCH IS ACTUALLY UNNECESSARY BECAUSE MOST OF THOSE ONLY A IS ALREADY QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL HARDSHIP WHICH MEANS THEY ALREADY RECEIVE UP TO A 100% OF THEIR PROJECTED COSTS FROM THE STATE SO WELL INTENDED AND APPRECIATED BUT WE ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THAT MEASURE IS NECESSARY. THE OTHER PIECE A FULL DAY CANDOR IS THAT -- THE MAY REVISE STILL FAILS TO ADDRESS THE DISINCENTIVE CREATED BECAUSE OF THE THE THE ELIMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR OF THE STATE SCHOOL BOND PROGRAM THE STATE SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM SO WE WOULD HELP THE COMMITTEE ADDRESS THAT.

A WHILE THE MAYBE VISION DID NOT INCLUDE FUNDS TO CONTINUE THE VERY SUCCESSFUL ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAM A PROPOSITION. THIRTY NINE WE HOPE IN THE LEGISLATURE CREATES ITS PRIORITIES FOR THE BUDGET. YOU'LL CONTINUE TO CONSIDER ASSEMBLY MEMBER. GONZALEZ'S REQUEST FOR FUNDING TO CONTINUE THAT PROGRAM IT IS A GRANT PROGRAM. WHICH MEANS IT CAN BE DONE WITH ONE TIME MONEY. AND AS A GRANT PROGRAM CAN GO UP OR DOWN DEPENDING UPON ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES. ALSO REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA RETIRED TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WE SUPPORT THEM A REVISION PROPOSAL OF PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO CAL STARS IN ORDER TO REDUCE SOME OF THE EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION PRESSURE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JEFF BARKER REPRESENTING THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. WITH REGARD TO SPECIAL EDUCATION -- YOU KIND OF MADE OUR JOB EASY TODAY -- I THINK I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT CONCERNS THAT WERE EXPRESSED BY NEARLY ALL OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THIS MORNING. A WE SUPPORT THE INCREASED LEVEL OF FUNDING WE SUPPORT THAT FUNDING BEING ON GOING. WE CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THE A CONCENTRATION GRANT APPROACHED ALLOCATING THE FUNDS. THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA FOR HIS LEGISLATION ON EQUALIZATION AND THAT IS A CRITICAL FACTOR THAT BELIEVE WE BELIEVE. MUST BE INCLUDED IN ANY A SOLUTION ON SPECIAL LIKE EDUCATION ALSO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL FOR HIS COMMENTS ABOUT EARLY INTERVENTION AND INCLUSION -- WITH REGARD -- TO THE CAL STIRS PROPOSAL WE SUPPORT THE INCREASED CON -- ALLOCATION FOR THE EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION RATE. ON THE CLASSIFIED SUMMER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM -- WE DID NOT SUPPORT THE CREATION OF THAT PROGRAM -- WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THOSE FUNDS WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVELY ALLOCATED TO STUDENT PROGRAMS. AND THEN LASTLY ON THE TEACHER WORKFORCE INVESTMENT ROPOSALS -- WE VERY MUCH SUPPORT AND APPRECIATE THOSE INVESTMENTS THANK YOU. HI DO NAY MCCARTY COLBERN REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM ASSOCIATION -- WE TO APPRECIATE THE FOCUS OF THE GOVERNOR ON ON OUR EARLIEST LEARNERS AND FAMILIES WE DO HAVE.

A PRIORITY PUT IN SCHOOL AGE YOUR INFANT TODDLER I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT FOR THE VOUCHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE. OUR AGENCY SUPPORT FAMILIES AND SO IF YOU PUT A A PRIORITY ON ONE AGE BRACKET. YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO SKIP OVER SOME OF THE MOST NEEDIEST FAMILIES IN ORDER TO FILL YOUR ALLOCATION FOR A SPECIFIC AGE. SO -- IN REGARDS THE ASUS PROGRAM ALSO IN TERMS OF A CONVERSATION ABOUT SPACES MANY OF THE AP'S ALSO HAVE THE ASUS PROGRAM. SO IF THEY WERE AT THE TABLE WE COULD COME UP WITH SOME CREATIVE IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN.

GOOD MORNING MICHELLE MCANDREW IT ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION -- TO BUILD UPON THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE MISTER ROCK OF FROM RIVERSIDE COUNTY -- I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE UNDERLYING POINT -- THAT NOT ALL DISTRICTS AROUND THE STATE WILL RECEIVE FUNDS UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN THE DATA POINT THAT ABOUT A QUARTER OF LEDS RECEIVE THEM SO -- FOR YOU MISTER MCCARTY'S FOR EXAMPLE SAN JUAN WILL RECEIVE NOTHING TORRANCE UNIFIED WILL RECEIVE NOTHING SANTA BARBARA UNIFIED WILL RECEIVE NOTHING RIVERSIDE UNIFIED WILL RECEIVE NOTHING.
