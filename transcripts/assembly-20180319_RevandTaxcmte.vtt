I WANT TO JUST TOUCH AND A

00:14:00.807 --> 00:14:04.544 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF VERY IMPORTANT POINT

00:14:02.475 --> 00:14:06.312 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WAS SO A WELL

00:14:04.544 --> 00:14:08.614 region:rollup2
ARTICULATED BY MY COLLEAGUE.

00:14:06.312 --> 00:14:10.350 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:14:08.614 --> 00:14:12.251 region:rollup2
AFFECTED BY THIS DISEASE ONE OF

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:15.988 region:rollup2
THE THINGS THAT'S HAPPENING IN

00:14:12.251 --> 00:14:17.623 region:rollup2
AS WE ARE. SOCIETY GETS OLDER IS

00:14:15.988 --> 00:14:19.258 region:rollup2
IT'S BECOMING MORE DIVERSE AND

00:14:17.623 --> 00:14:21.427 region:rollup2
SO THE OTHER THING THAT WASN'T

00:14:19.258 --> 00:14:21.994 region:rollup2
TOUCHED ON BY MY COLLEAGUE. IS

00:14:21.427 --> 00:14:24.097 region:rollup2

UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE IS

00:14:29.802 --> 00:14:32.972 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE ARE DISPARITIES

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.707 region:rollup2
LATINOS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS

00:14:32.972 --> 00:14:37.076 region:rollup2

00:42:51.002 --> 00:42:54.772 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THEM UNTIL

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:56.407 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GONE.

00:42:54.772 --> 00:42:57.775 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THAT'S A VERY BIG

00:42:56.407 --> 00:42:58.543 region:rollup2
WORRY FIRST

00:42:57.775 --> 00:43:02.013 region:rollup2
FOR US AS PARENTS.

00:42:58.543 --> 00:43:04.882 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:43:02.013 --> 00:43:05.483 region:rollup2
WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE

00:43:05.483 --> 00:43:10.188 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE.

00:43:07.852 --> 00:43:13.558 region:rollup2
DOT QUIRK.

00:43:10.188 --> 00:43:15.626 region:rollup2
SO BOB I CERTAINLY I RESPECT THE

00:43:13.558 --> 00:43:18.296 region:rollup2
NEEDS OF THE.

00:43:15.626 --> 00:43:20.465 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY. UNFORTUNATELY WITH

00:43:18.296 --> 00:43:22.333 region:rollup2
THIS BILL DOES IS GIVES THE PATH

00:43:20.465 --> 00:43:24.068 region:rollup2
THEY MOST OF THE BENEFIT TO THE

00:43:22.333 --> 00:43:26.104 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE MOST MONEY.

00:43:24.068 --> 00:43:27.972 region:rollup2
AND ALMOST NO BENEFIT TO PEOPLE

00:43:26.104 --> 00:43:28.372 region:rollup2
WHO MAKE VERY LITTLE MONEY.

00:43:27.972 --> 00:43:31.309 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE MAKING.

00:43:28.372 --> 00:43:32.810 region:rollup2
FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR FOR

00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:34.378 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE YOU GET TWO THOUSAND

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:35.880 region:rollup2
DOLLARS BACK.

00:43:34.378 --> 00:43:37.081 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU'RE MAKING A MILLION

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:39.217 region:rollup2
DOLLARS YEAR YOU GET THIRTEEN

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:41.819 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS BACK.

00:43:39.217 --> 00:43:44.055 region:rollup2
SO THE DIFFICULTY HERE IS SIMPLY

00:43:41.819 --> 00:43:45.823 region:rollup2
THAT MOST OF THE BENEFIT GOES TO

00:43:44.055 --> 00:43:47.825 region:rollup2
THE HIGHER INCOME OWNERS.

00:43:45.823 --> 00:43:49.660 region:rollup2
I WOULD RESPECT ABILITY THE SAME

00:43:47.825 --> 00:43:50.895 region:rollup2
PRICE SIX MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:53.498 region:rollup2
ROUGHLY.

00:43:50.895 --> 00:43:55.233 region:rollup2
IF IT. GAVE MOST OF THE MONEY

00:43:53.498 --> 00:43:57.602 region:rollup2
TO THE PEOPLE WHO MADE LESS

00:43:55.233 --> 00:43:59.470 region:rollup2
MONEY. AND NO MONEY TO ANYONE

00:43:57.602 --> 00:44:01.172 region:rollup2
WHO SAY MADE MORE THAN FIVE

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:03.641 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THOUSAND YEAR. UNDER

00:44:01.172 --> 00:44:04.876 region:rollup2
THIS SPELL SOMEBODY MAKING FIVE

00:44:03.641 --> 00:44:06.544 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THOUSAND HERE WOULD GET

00:44:04.876 --> 00:44:07.578 region:rollup2
THE TEN TEN PERCENT OR TEN

00:44:06.544 --> 00:44:09.814 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLAR.

00:44:07.578 --> 00:44:10.281 region:rollup2
.

00:44:09.814 --> 00:44:12.617 region:rollup2
IT'S YOU MEAN NAY DAY.

00:44:10.281 --> 00:44:14.519 region:rollup2
.

00:44:12.617 --> 00:44:16.087 region:rollup2
SAVE THE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:44:14.519 --> 00:44:18.389 region:rollup2
THEY COULD GET A TEN THOUSAND

00:44:16.087 --> 00:44:19.490 region:rollup2
DOLLAR BENEFIT. I JUST DON'T

00:44:18.389 --> 00:44:21.726 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S EQUITABLE.

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:23.928 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN IF YOU COULD COME

00:44:21.726 --> 00:44:24.996 region:rollup2
BACK WITH THE BILL WHERE MOST OF

00:44:23.928 --> 00:44:26.864 region:rollup2
THE MONEY WENT O LOW INCOME

00:44:24.996 --> 00:44:29.333 region:rollup2
INNER EARNERS I COULD CERTAINLY

00:44:26.864 --> 00:44:31.869 region:rollup2
SUPPORT IT THANK YOU.

00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:34.138 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

00:44:31.869 --> 00:44:35.473 region:rollup2
JUDGE BECAUSE I WOULD WHICH IS

00:44:34.138 --> 00:44:37.708 region:rollup2
ONLY A HOLLOW ONCE AGAIN.

00:44:35.473 --> 00:44:39.377 region:rollup2
MISTER BONTA KEY SPEAKING MR

00:44:37.708 --> 00:44:41.279 region:rollup2
MCCARTY IS A MICROPHONE FOR

00:44:39.377 --> 00:44:41.479 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW.

00:44:41.279 --> 00:44:43.915 region:rollup2
SURE.

00:44:41.479 --> 00:44:45.149 region:rollup2
.

00:44:43.915 --> 00:44:46.984 region:rollup2
JUST A A CLARIFYING QUESTION ARE

00:44:45.149 --> 00:44:48.085 region:rollup2
THERE ANY OTHER AREAS WHERE WE

00:44:46.984 --> 00:44:48.920 region:rollup2
GIVE SORT OF THAT THAT THE

00:44:48.085 --> 00:44:50.688 region:rollup2
DOUBLE TAX.

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:52.223 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE.

00:44:50.688 --> 00:44:52.790 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE AND

00:44:52.223 --> 00:44:54.625 region:rollup2
AND.

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:55.826 region:rollup2
MY UNDERSTANDINGS THAT THAT

00:44:54.625 --> 00:44:58.229 region:rollup2
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT UNIQUE ARE

00:44:55.826 --> 00:45:00.798 region:rollup2
MAYBE UNPRECEDENTED. AND ALSO.

00:44:58.229 --> 00:45:02.333 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE BEHAVIORAL CHANGE?

00:45:00.798 --> 00:45:03.134 region:rollup2
THAT YOU ANTICIPATE WHAT WILL

00:45:02.333 --> 00:45:04.902 region:rollup2
HAPPEN BECAUSE OF THIS BILL THAT

00:45:03.134 --> 00:45:06.070 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT ARE PEOPLE NOT DOING

00:45:04.902 --> 00:45:09.273 region:rollup2
BUT BECAUSE OF YOUR BILL TO ALL

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:11.342 region:rollup2
THE STUDY BE. INCENTIVE TO DO OR

00:45:09.273 --> 00:45:12.343 region:rollup2
WILL START DOING.

00:45:11.342 --> 00:45:14.278 region:rollup2
BUT WE CERTAINLY WANT A SET OF

00:45:12.343 --> 00:45:14.745 region:rollup2
FIVE AS MANY CALIFORNIANS TO

00:45:14.278 --> 00:45:16.180 region:rollup2
SAVE.

00:45:14.745 --> 00:45:17.481 region:rollup2
AS POSSIBLE FOR THE SPECIALLY

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:19.417 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS.

00:45:17.481 --> 00:45:22.186 region:rollup2
WHO ARE WHO HAVE WHO HAVE NEEDS?

00:45:19.417 --> 00:45:23.321 region:rollup2
DO THEIR DISABILITIES.

00:45:22.186 --> 00:45:24.589 region:rollup2
.

00:45:23.321 --> 00:45:27.725 region:rollup2
SO IF IT DID THE DOUBLE TAXATION

00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:28.826 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT AYE AYE IS IS IS THE

00:45:27.725 --> 00:45:30.261 region:rollup2
ONE THAT'S OUT THERE BUT WHEN WE

00:45:28.826 --> 00:45:31.195 region:rollup2
ONE INCENTIVIZE NOT ONLY JUST

00:45:30.261 --> 00:45:33.297 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL BUT THEIR FAMILIES AS

00:45:31.195 --> 00:45:34.665 region:rollup2
WELL SO. THE I THE UNCLE THE

00:45:33.297 --> 00:45:36.500 region:rollup2
MOTHER THE FATHER THEY DON'T

00:45:34.665 --> 00:45:37.868 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T GET A DEDUCTION AT

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:39.070 region:rollup2
THE MOMENT SO HOW WE WON

00:45:37.868 --> 00:45:41.739 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZE THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:42.306 region:rollup2
SAVE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FOR THE

00:45:41.739 --> 00:45:43.741 region:rollup2
FUTURE OF THEIR CHILDREN. OR

00:45:42.306 --> 00:45:45.309 region:rollup2
FAMILY MEMBERS.

00:45:43.741 --> 00:45:46.244 region:rollup2
I WOULD ALSO ADD TO THAT THAT

00:45:45.309 --> 00:45:48.145 region:rollup2
THERE IS A.

00:45:46.244 --> 00:45:49.080 region:rollup2
THE VET.

00:45:48.145 --> 00:45:50.281 region:rollup2
THEY'RE TWO SIDES TO THIS SO

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:52.483 region:rollup2
THERE'S THAT TAX ADVANTAGE

00:45:50.281 --> 00:45:53.951 region:rollup2
PORTION FOR THE BENEFICIARY SO

00:45:52.483 --> 00:45:56.921 region:rollup2
IT LOOKS THAT.

00:45:53.951 --> 00:45:58.122 region:rollup2
VERB THAT EARNINGS ON INTEREST

00:45:56.921 --> 00:46:00.524 region:rollup2
FROM INVESTMENTS.

00:45:58.122 --> 00:46:03.661 region:rollup2
AT THAT IS RELATIVELY.

00:46:00.524 --> 00:46:05.363 region:rollup2
THAT MAYBE RARE IN MOST CASES

00:46:03.661 --> 00:46:06.931 region:rollup2
THE WAY THAT THAT ABLE ACCOUNTS

00:46:05.363 --> 00:46:09.133 region:rollup2
WORK THEY'RE VERY TRANSACTIONAL.

00:46:06.931 --> 00:46:11.402 region:rollup2
AND SO MOST MANY FOLKS WHO USE

00:46:09.133 --> 00:46:13.938 region:rollup2
IT MAY NOT INVEST FOR LONG TERM

00:46:11.402 --> 00:46:16.173 region:rollup2
EARNINGS ON THAT SO. BUT EVEN IF

00:46:13.938 --> 00:46:17.541 region:rollup2
THEY DID THAT BENEFIT WOULD GO

00:46:16.173 --> 00:46:19.744 region:rollup2
TO THE BENEFICIARY THE OWNER OF

00:46:17.541 --> 00:46:21.812 region:rollup2
THE ACCOUNT WHEREAS FOR THIS

00:46:19.744 --> 00:46:22.313 region:rollup2
BILL IT LOOKS AT THE PEOPLE WHO

00:46:21.812 --> 00:46:23.214 region:rollup2
ARE CONTRIBUTING FOR THE

00:46:22.313 --> 00:46:24.782 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT.

00:46:23.214 --> 00:46:26.917 region:rollup2
AND SO WE WANT TO INCENTIVIZE

00:46:24.782 --> 00:46:28.619 region:rollup2
THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO CONTRIBUTE.

00:46:26.917 --> 00:46:30.287 region:rollup2
