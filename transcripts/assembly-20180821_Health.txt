OR TOBACCO USE WITH ONLY LIMITED EXCEPTIONS SMOKING PROCESS IS A LEADING CAUSE OF PREVENTABLE DEATH BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND WORLDWIDE CAUSES MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND DEATHS IN THE UNITED STATES EACH YEAR. IN TWENTY TWELVE THE US SURGEON GENERAL DETERMINE THAT THERE IS A CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOUTH VIEWING OF SMOKING IN MOVIES AND INITIATION SMOKING. TWENTY FOURTEEN THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL PREVENTION REPORT EXPOSURE TO DEPICTIONS OF SMOKING IN MOVIES WILL COST ABOUT SIX POINT FOUR MILLION. CHILDREN ALIVE TODAY TO BECOME SMOKERS. THE PEDIATRICIAN I KNOW THAT THE ABSOLUTE BEST WAY TO PREVENT THAT'S RELATED TO SMOKING IS TO PREVENT YOUTH FROM EVER BECOMING ADDICTED TO THESE DEADLY PRODUCTS IN THE FIRST PLACE. A PROUD OF SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO PURCHASE TO BACK ON REGULATE E. CIGARETTES HE'S MEASURES GO A LONG WAY TO ENSURING THAT OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL NOT FACE THE SAME BURNED AT THE BACK OF RELATED DISEASES. HOWEVER OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THERE'S EVEN MORE TO BE DONE TO KEEP KIDS FROM SMOKING DRAW IF SOMEONE DOESN'T INITIATE SMOKING BY TIME THEY'RE IN THEIR MID TWENTIES ARE UNLIKELY TO DO SO. NEARLY HALF A CENTURY AGO THE U. S. BAR TOBACCO ADVERTISING ON TELEVISION RADIO. HOWEVER CHILDREN CONTINUE TO BE EXPOSED TO TOBACCO USE IN MOVIES WITH PGP G. THIRTEEN RATING RATINGS. OUTSIDE OF THE LEGISLATURE TO LEAD THE WAY BY URGING THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR RATING MOVIES TO TAKE ACTIONS. IF YOU'RE YOUTH WILL STAR START SMOKING IF ALL MOVIES THAT THE TO PICK. TOBACCO USE ARE GIVEN AN R. RATING. I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT MADE -- URGENT AYE VOTE ON THIS YEAR -- ONE FORTY THREE NOW PLEASED TO HAVE AS WITNESSES A SUPPORT DAVID BESET WITH GRIEF CALIFORNIA AND TIM GIVES WITH THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY CANCER ACTION NETWORK.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DAVE MODEST THAT -- I'M WITH BRIEF CALIFORNIA SACRAMENTO REGION -- OUR ORGANIZATION -- AS A PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATION WE'VE BEEN. MEADOW TO IMPROVE LONG HEALTH SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTEEN SO OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AYE AND AS PART OF OUR WORK FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS WE'VE WE'VE BEEN -- CATEGORIZING -- SMOKING AND TOBACCO SCENES IN MAJOR MOTION MOTION PICTURES -- AND THAT DATA IS USED BY PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE WORLD -- SO THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN STUDIED AT LENGTH -- ANY GREAT IN GREAT DETAIL AND THERE'S CONSENSUS IN THE MEDICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITIES -- ON THIS ISSUE SO WHAT ARE THE FACTS. I GUESS FIRST OF ALL THAT SMOKING SCENES AND YOU THE RATED MOVIES ACTUALLY BECAUSE CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS TO STARTS TO START SMOKING. THIS WAS THE FINDING OF THE SURGEON GENERAL IN TWENTY TWELVE SECONDLY THAT 37% OF ALL NEW YOUNG SMOKERS START SMOKING BECAUSE OF THE SMOKING SCENES IN MOVIES. THIRDS EVEN TODAY 50% OF ALL P. G. THIRTEEN OF MOVIES CONTAINS SCENES OF SMOKING AND TOBACCO AND LASTLY AS THE SENATOR SAID. THE US CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL ESTIMATES THAT SIX POINT FOUR MILLION CHILDREN WILL START START SMOKING AS RESULT OF THESE SMOKING SCENES TWO MILLION OF THOSE WILL DIE PREMATURELY. FROM TOBACCO RELATED LUNG CANCER STROKE HEART DISEASE ARM THE POLICY RECOMMENDATION UNLESS YOU ARE ONE FORTY THREE DOES COME FROM THE US CENTER FOR TO FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND AS I SAID THERE'S A CONSENSUS AMONG THE PUP PUBLIC HEALTH. AND MEDICAL COMMUNITIES ON THIS. AND AS YOU KNOW THE MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION GIVES IN OUR RATING TO MOVIES THAT HAVE BAD LANGUAGE. ABOUT WE CURRENTLY DO NOT -- GIVE THE SAME RATING TO A PRACTICE TOBACCO USE THAT WE KNOW IS BECAUSE THE YOUNG PEOPLE TO BECOME ADDICTED TO HAVE MAJOR HEALTH PROBLEMS DURING THEIR LIVES AND MANY OF THEM. TO DIE PREMATURELY THIS JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. S. C. ARE ONE FORTY THREE IS NOT A MANDATE IT'S NOT A STATUTE IT IS A REQUEST A RECOMMENDATION THAT THE MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY BRING ITS RATING SYSTEM UP TO DATE. WITH THE CURRENT MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC FACTS ON THE ISSUE AND WITH THE CONSENSUS OF THE MEDICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITIES. THE MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION CAN SAVE ONE MILLION KIDS FROM DISEASEAND DEATH IF THEY IMPLEMENT THIS RECOMMENDATION WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. RIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST HIM GIVES THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY CANCER ACTION NETWORK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN VOTERS PASSED PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX WHICH INCREASE THE TOBACCO TAX BY TWO DOLLARS PER PACK WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO EDUCATE CHILDREN ABOUT THE DANGERS OF SMOKING. HOWEVER IMAGES OF FAMOUS ACTORS SMOKING IN FILMS REPRESENT A DANGER AND COULD POTENTIALLY UNDER MOUNTING THE IMPORTANT WORK PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDED PROGRAMS ARE THAT THEY YOU KNOW THAT THEIR ACHIEVING IT. AND OUR SCHOOLS -- AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THE U. S. SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT CONCLUDED THAT EXPOSURE TO SMOKING IN MOVIES BECAUSE YOUNG PEOPLE TO START SMOKING SMOKING IN MOVIES HAS THE SAME AFFECT US MORE TRADITIONAL TOBACCO. MARKETING AND ADVERTISING BY THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY. AND THE REPORT WAS ON TO SUGGEST THAT EFFORTS TO DECREASE DEPICTIONS OF SMOKING IN MOVIES IS. HOT IS WARRANTED -- WERE PROUD CALIFORNIANS WHO EMBRACE OUR STATE'S HISTORY OF BEING THE LEADER IN GLOBAL FILM PRODUCTION HOWEVER DUE TO THE OUTSIZED INFLUENCE. OUR UNDERSTATES YOUTH IT IS OFTEN THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYER WHO FOOTS THE BILL FOR IMAGES OF SMOKING -- IN FILMS AS TOBACCO RELATED ILLNESS COSTS US THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN DIRECT A HEALTHCARE EXPENSES -- THROUGH MEDICAL. SO FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE FOR THIS CRITICAL RESOLUTION THAT COULD HELP TECH COMPANIES IF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- BEFORE YOU ASK BROTHERS IN SUPPORT AMEND SECTION WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WE HAVE A QUORUM IT LOOKS LIKE WOOD HERE. MAYES HERE AGAR CURRY BIGELOW [inaudible] BONTA BURKE [inaudible] CARILLO [inaudible] FLORA [inaudible] LIMON [inaudible] MCCARTY. NAZARIAN. RODRIGUEZ SANTIAGO. THURMOND HERE WALDRON HERE.

GOOD AFTERNOON BRED IN MARCH WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT Q.. WHEN SPENCER WITH THE COW FRANK CATNIP FAMILY PHYSICIANS IN SUPPORT? LYDIA BORN AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS CALIFORNIA DIVISION IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. SEE NO ONE OF BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YOUR COMMENTS FROM COMMAND SURE. HI GOOD AFTERNOON -- YOU KNOW. IN IN GENERAL BY 1100% SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE SMOKING AND FACT ACTUALLY. BELIEVE THAT WE COULD BE DOING. UP. MORE. WHEN IT COMES TO TO YOUTH THEN AND SMOKING HOWEVER? I AM A FORMER PRODUCER FORMER DIRECTOR. AND I FIND IT A LITTLE PROBLEMATIC THAT WE ARE GONNA TAKE. MAKE ARTISTIC DECISIONS ON A WHAT COULD BE REAL LIFE EXPERIENCES. WHEN IT COMES TO FILM WHEN IT COMES TO DEPICTING THE LIVES OF YOUNG PEOPLE OF THE REALITIES THAT THEY FACE EVERY SINGLE DAY? I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S THE THE JOB OF THIS LEGISLATURE TO FIGURE OUT OR TRY TO TRY TO MAKE CREATIVE DECISIONS ON FILMS FOR THE MOVIE INDUSTRY. BASED ON SMOKING I THINK THERE ARE OTHER ALTERNATIVES THAT CAN BE DONE LIKE THAT MAY BE A WARNING. AT THE END OF THE FILM MUCH LIKE THERE ARE WARNINGS WHEN AYE ANIMALS OR USE A NO ANIMALS ARE HARMED THAT THE FILM DOES ENCOURAGE SMOKING WHICH I BELIEVE AND BUT I JUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT. WE SHOULD BE IN A POSITION OF TELLING THE DIRECTOR PRODUCER WHAT TO DO WITH ARTISTIC EXPRESSION -- WHEN IT ACTUALLY IS OF A VERY -- DAILY LIFE EXPERIENCE OF A YOUNG PERSON AND I'M ALSO CONCERNED OF WHAT IT WOULD MEAN ECONOMICALLY. IF WE WERE TO NOW CHANGE THE RATING OF A FILM. TO WHEN OUR RATING IN WHICH YOUNG PEOPLE WILL NOT HAVE ACCESS -- TO AND THE IMPACT THAT THAT WOULD HAVE IN MY DISTRICT HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS THAT WORK IN THE MOVIE INDUSTRY IN THE CITY INDUSTRY MY DISTRICT -- AND THE IMPACT THAT THAT HOUSE ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I I COMMAND FOR THE I COMMEND YOU AREDOCTOR PATH FOR WANTING TO MOVE SOMETHING FORWARD. BUT I WILL BE ABSTAINING OF FROM THOSE VOTE AND I HOPE TO WORK WITH YOU IN THE FUTURE ON HOW WE CAN TWEAK SOME OF THIS AND HOW WE CAN HELP YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE LONG RUN. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SURE. I AM. I JUST HAD A COMMENT BECAUSE MY SON YOU KNOW MS VIDEO GAMES EVERYTHING IN THE WAY THEY DO THEIR RATINGS AND I'M NOT SURE THIS OUR MEMBER YOU KNOW. YOU JUST SEE YOU KNOW PT THIRTEEN OR DOESN'T DO THEY LIST ON THEIR WIRED SPEED YOU DON'T JUST SAY VIOLENCE ERIC'S YOU KNOW LANGUAGE. YES I KNOW IN THE VIDEO GAMES FAILSAFE T. FOR TEEN IN THE LIST YOU KNOW LANGUAGE OR VIOLENCE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. YEAH I'M JUST THINKING. WHAT BELIEFS OF BELIEVE SO STATEMENT? AT LEAST THE BROAD. CAT YES SEXUAL KONTOR BRAILLE BROAD CATEGORIES OF AND AND AND I WOULD MAKE NOTE I APPRECIATE THAT YOU BRING THIS OFFICE IS THAT -- THE RATING SYSTEM IS NOT. A THAT CENSORSHIP SYSTEM IT'S ACTUALLY TO INFORM PARENTS RIGHT OF WHAT -- WHAT -- THERE'D THEIR CHILDREN MIGHT BE EXPOSED TO RIGHT AND IT'S THE PARENTS TO JUDGE -- WHAT THEY THINK IT'S ACCEPTABLE FOR THEIR CHILDREN TO WATCH SO I SEE A LOT OF UNDER THIRTEEN CHILDREN SHOW BUT PEACHY THIRTEEN MOVIES -- AND THAT SIR -- AND I THINK THEY'LL TO CERTAIN EXTENT WILL HAVE IDEAS BE SURE -- PARENTS THE RATING SYSTEM IS THE EXISTING SYSTEM THAT THE MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY USES TO INFORM PARENTS OF THE PARENTS ARE AWARE OF WHAT THEIR CHILDREN MIGHT BE EXPOSED TO BEFORE. IN A MOVIE BEFORE THEY OF COURSE STEED MOVIE. AND THAT THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS IS A APPROPRIATE AND AS WAS MENTIONED BY MY WITNESSES AND WE'RE DOING THIS IS A RESOLUTION OR NOT DOING THIS IS A STATUTE BECAUSE WE'RE HOPING THAT WE CAN WORK WITH THE MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY. RECOGNIZING THAT DEPICTIONS OF SMOKING OF EVIDENCE IS THERE TO SHOWS THAT CAN CAUSE A REAL HARM AND SO WHY APPRECIATE. ARTISTRY I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO PEOPLE NEED BE WHERE THE PLATES OF CONSEQUENCES AND PARENTS NEED TO KNOW AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE SAYING THAT WE SHOULD DO THROUGH THE RATING SYSTEM WE'RE NOT TRYING TO LIMIT -- DIRECTORS FROM. WHAT THEY DECIDE TO FINALLY CHOOSE TO DO IN THE MOVIES? SO THE JUST AS A FOLLOW UP I WAS LOOKING IN THE THE TIME COMMITTEE REPORT AND IT WAS SAYING MENTIONING THAT BECAUSE I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW IS THIS A NEW. STANDARD BUT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN ADULTS SMOKING WAS A FACTOR IN THE RATING SYSTEM AND YOUTH SMOKING HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDERED IN THEIR WAITING. SO WHY LIKE CONSIDER IT THAT'S WHY I WAS ASKING TO THEY LISTED. YOU KNOW AS A PARENT I'M GONNA LOOK AND SEE IF THERE'S A HAVE YOU KNOW. LANGUAGE JUNE YEAH DOESN'T WHATEVER AT NIGHT I'D THAT DOESN'T NOT SPECIFICALLY SAY SMOKING AND THE RATINGS SYSTEM. VERBS I'D TURN TERMS OF FELT THE SUBTEXT ABOUT LIKE SEXUAL CONTACTS ARE AT THE ROOT THERE ISN'T TO THIS FARCE I'VE AWARE OF THEIRS IN A CATEGORY. FOR FOR SMOKING FINE BECAUSE I THINK TO THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN'S POINT TO IT WHICH CAME UP I DIDN'T EVEN THINK OF IT TILL JUST NOW IS THAT. ONCE IT MOVES TO IN OUR THEN THERE'S A WHOLE GROUP OF KIDS NOW THAT WON'T BE A OF YOUNG PEOPLE. FROM THAT PJ. THIRTEEN TO NOW TO OUR THAT WON'T BE ABLE TO GO SO THAT'S YOU KNOW TO HER POINT OF IT WHAT PARENTS WOULD SEE IT. THEY'VE NOW THEY WON'T EVEN BE ABLE TO GO SO [inaudible] ANYWAY. THANK YOU CAN SURVEYS ENTER. I ACTUALLY THINK. THAT THE MEMBER FROM LA -- DID OF PRETTY FANTASTIC JOB BY AND WAS MUCH MORE ARTICULATE THAN THAN I WILL BE ON THIS -- BUT I DO BELIEVE DOCTOR PAN THAT YOU'RE -- SENATOR PAN -- S. R. ARE GOOD WITH WITH HIS BILL I JUST HAVE. YES THE ABSTRACT FOR ME IT'S THE PHILOSOPHICAL I'M I'M NOT SURE THAT IT THAT IT'S THE PLACE OF THE LEGISLATURE TO TO START TO GET INTO THESE SPEECH ISSUES. AND I DO THINK OUR FILMS EVEN THOUGH I DON'T. IF I HAD CHILDREN I WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WEREN'T -- THAT IT WASN'T COOL TO TO SMOKE SO I UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE IT ISN'T COOL A TO SMOKE THERE ARE LIFE LONG -- THERE THERE'S DAMAGE THAT CAN OCCUR IN THEIR HEALTH -- AND TO THE COMMUNITIES HELP BECAUSE OF THAT'S WHY UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR INTENTIONS ARE RIGHT I JUST HAD -- PROBLEMS -- WITH -- TELLING THE MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY -- AND AND AND AND THEN PUTTING SOMETHING IN THEIR DECISION MAKING OF WHETHER -- THEY WANT TO FILL THE ARTISTIC EXPRESSION OR NOT BASED UPON ON THAT AND I UNDERSTAND THIS ISN'T THIS ISN'T BINDING AS WELL IT'S JUST ENCOURAGING THEM -- BUT FOR THOSE REASONS I'M ALL OF THE OF STANDING AS WELL. IT'S REYES BUSINESS AREA. THANK YOU MISTER UP. MY COLLEAGUE FROM LA HAS ALREADY SPOKEN WELL ON IT SO I'M JUST I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW IN ADVANCE OF THE VOTE THAT I'D BE UPSTANDING. THINK PART OF IT ALSO IS THAT -- IF YOU WANT TO UTILIZE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EDUCATE BECAUSE MOVIE MAKING IS ALSO CAPTURING AND CHRONICLING CERTAIN ERA -- SO FOR THAT REASON IBM. I WILL BE HERE ABSTAINING THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEN KNOWN WILL BRING IT BACK TO DUCK DUCK SENT IT SENATOR PATH. OF A CUTE. CLOTHES THANK YOU WELL. THAT IS A PHYSICIAN I KNOW THAT SMOKING IS A OBVIOUSLY IS VARIOUS. IT IS A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC AT ONE OF OUR MOST SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES UMP THE REACHED THAT THE DATA IS AND WHAT WE WANT IS IS THAT WE WANT. TO AND ASK THAT THE MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY BE ENGAGED. AND TRYING TO LIMIT EXPOSURE TO DEPICTIONS OF SMOKING BECAUSE WE KNOW IT CAN CAUSE ACTUAL HARM -- SO -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT PARENTS ACTUALLY NO I MEAN THIS IS NOT ABOUT LIMITING ARTISTS EXPRESSION THIS IS ABOUT FUTURE PARENTS KNOW MANY OF US ARE PARENTS HERE. AND THAT WE SEND A CHILD. TO A MOVIE AND WE SEE RATING SYSTEM WE OFTEN USE THE RATING SYSTEM IS A WAY TO HELP US JUDGE WHETHER OF MOVIES APPROPRIATE NOT FOR CHILDREN. OF WE AND SO I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR US -- TO ENCOURAGE THE MOTION PICTURE INDUSTRY TO SHOW WE PROTECT CHILDREN FROM HARM THAT OF PARENTS ARE AWARE AND ARE GIVEN THAT KIND OF INFORMATION THAT ASPECT WE ASK WHEN I BUT I THINK. IT'S VERY MUCH SENATOR PAN AYE I ACTUALLY I THINK DO AGREE WITH YOU -- THE BILL DOES ENJOY OR THE THE RESOLUTION DOESN'T ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION I DO RESPECT IN AND APPRECIATE THAT THAT THE CONVERSATION FROM FROM OUR COLLEAGUES ON THIS AND THIS IS A THIS IS A THIS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT A LITTLE MORE CHALLENGE. BUT BUT THE INPUT THE THE CHALLENGES WE FACE FROM SMOKING THE REAL LIFE. CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AS A SOCIETY IN THE INDIVIDUALS I THINK ARE ARE UNMISTAKABLE AND IN THE IN THE SPIRIT OF TRYING TO DIMINISH THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY SMOKE I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO SO -- WITH THAT -- DEMOTION WE HAVE A MOTION.
