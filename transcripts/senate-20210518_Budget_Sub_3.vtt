00:16:02.194 --> 00:16:04.029
POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON

00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:06.031
GOING. IN CONSULTING FUNDS

00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:07.700
WHICH THIS REPRESENTS- A

00:16:07.766 --> 00:16:09.101
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN WHAT WE

00:16:09.168 --> 00:16:12.004
ASK FOR IN JANUARY AND THAT'S

00:16:12.071 --> 00:16:13.038
REALLY BECAUSE WE WANTED TO BE

00:16:13.105 --> 00:16:15.341

00:16:37.196 --> 00:16:39.198
WE ALSO SEE THIS IS AS KIND OF

00:16:39.264 --> 00:16:40.566
AN AWESOME RESPONSIBILITY IN

00:16:40.632 --> 00:16:42.067

BEING ABLE TO BE READY FOR THE

00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:43.480

AND IT'S- KIND OF VARIOUS

00:54:56.059 --> 00:54:57.727
COMPONENTS THAT WOULD LIKE TO

00:54:57.794 --> 00:55:00.930

YEAH SO- AGREE WE THAT THAT-

00:55:04.901 --> 00:55:06.936
THERE IS IMPORTANT COMPONENTS

00:55:07.003 --> 00:55:10.874
OF THAT ARE ARE THE VALUATION

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:13.109
PROGRAM AND PLAN. THAT CAN AND

00:55:13.176 --> 00:55:15.078
WILL BE SHARED I THINKTHE

00:55:15.145 --> 00:55:15.812
POINT OF THE L. A. OWES AN

00:55:15.879 --> 00:55:17.347
IMPORTANT ONE THAT IT'S A

00:55:17.414 --> 00:55:20.283
COMPLEX OPERATED PROJECT AT THE

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:22.686
END IT. WILL REQUIRE CERTAIN

00:55:22.752 --> 00:55:25.188
COMPONENTS TO BE EVALUATED

00:55:25.255 --> 00:55:26.790
INDEPENDENTLY AND AS PART OF

00:55:26.856 --> 00:55:28.224
THE HALL FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:55:28.291 --> 00:55:30.660
VIRTUAL PLATFORM AT THE SCALE

00:55:30.727 --> 00:55:32.996
OF CALIFORNIA WHETHER IT'S DONE

00:55:33.063 --> 00:55:35.899
STATEWIDE OR IN. A COUPLE OF

00:55:35.965 --> 00:55:37.500
REGIONS IN CALIFORNIA OR

00:55:37.567 --> 00:55:39.069
SPLITTING THE STATE UP IN ALL

00:55:39.135 --> 00:55:40.737
REGIONS THAT WILL REQUIRE

00:55:40.804 --> 00:55:43.473
ITSELF MON EVALUATION THAT WILL

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:45.241
LOOK VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE

00:55:45.308 --> 00:55:46.976
COMPONENTS OF A VALUATION ON

00:55:47.043 --> 00:55:48.778
OUR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT.

00:55:48.845 --> 00:55:52.215
PROJECTS THOSE MAY CERTAINLY BE

00:55:52.282 --> 00:55:55.485
EVALUATED AROUND HOW QUICKLY-

00:55:55.552 --> 00:55:57.687
AND HIGH QUALITY THE TRAININGS

00:55:57.754 --> 00:55:59.723
ARE A QUICKLY THERE IN PLACE TO

00:55:59.789 --> 00:56:01.257
STOP LENGTH OF TIME THOSE

00:56:01.324 --> 00:56:03.059
PROGRAMS TAKE HOW SUCCESSFUL WE

00:56:03.126 --> 00:56:05.395
ARE. TO RECRUIT A BROAD AND

00:56:05.462 --> 00:56:07.464
DIVERSE SET OF CANDIDATES TO BE

00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:09.132
PART OF THE WORK FORCE SO EACH

00:56:09.199 --> 00:56:10.900
OF THESE THINGS IS WORTHY OF

00:56:10.967 --> 00:56:13.436
ITS OWN EVALUATION AND THEN. WE

00:56:13.503 --> 00:56:14.938
WILL LOOK TO EVALUATE THE

00:56:15.004 --> 00:56:16.606
ENTIRETY OF THE PROJECT OVER

00:56:16.673 --> 00:56:19.109
TIME THE EVALUATION IN MANY

00:56:19.175 --> 00:56:22.312
WAYS WILL BE MANIFEST- AS YOU

00:56:22.378 --> 00:56:24.714
SAID IT. DOWN THE ROAD WITH THE

00:56:24.781 --> 00:56:26.716
IMPACT AND DID THE CHANGE OF

00:56:26.783 --> 00:56:28.518
LIFE OPTIONS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE

00:56:28.585 --> 00:56:30.153
AND WE WILL BE MINDFUL OF THAT

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:31.488
I THINK WE HAVE SOME

00:56:31.554 --> 00:56:34.424
TREMENDOUS- COLLEAGUES IN

00:56:34.491 --> 00:56:36.693
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE OF

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:38.128
BOTH ACADEMIC AND OTHER

00:56:38.194 --> 00:56:40.363
EVALUATION GROUPS. THAT CAN

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:42.365
SUPPORT AND HELP THE STATE AND

00:56:42.432 --> 00:56:43.433
THEN OF COURSE THERE WILL BE

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:45.068
DEPARTMENT BY DEPARTMENT

00:56:45.135 --> 00:56:46.669
SPECIFIC EVALUATION COMPONENTS

00:56:46.736 --> 00:56:48.705
HERE AS WELL SO THAT IS

00:56:48.772 --> 00:56:51.207
CERTAINLY BEING WORKED OUT- NOW

00:56:51.274 --> 00:56:53.676
AND WILL FOLLOW. AND BE MODELED

00:56:53.743 --> 00:56:55.645
AROUND. THE SPECIFIC

00:56:55.712 --> 00:57:01.718
COMPONENTS. OF WHICH I LAID.

00:57:01.785 --> 00:57:02.352
OUT SEVEN KEY BUCKETS THAT EACH

00:57:02.418 --> 00:57:03.353
IN. EACH PART OF THAT WILL

00:57:03.419 --> 00:57:05.388
REQUIRE SOME OF THE UA- IT STEP

00:57:05.455 --> 00:57:08.224
MEASURE YOU WANT TO ADD TO THAT.

00:57:08.291 --> 00:57:10.126

TO SEE IF INDIVIDUAL PIECES ARE

00:57:18.034 --> 00:57:19.369
AFFECTED. BUT THEN THERE'S THIS

00:57:19.435 --> 00:57:21.404
INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE

00:57:21.471 --> 00:57:22.972

TWELVE. OUR FOCUS IS ZERO TO

01:02:12.295 --> 01:02:13.930
TWENTY FIVE. THERE IS A

01:02:13.996 --> 01:02:17.266
DESPERATE NEEDWE SAW CLEARLY-

01:02:17.333 --> 01:02:19.035
IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE

01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:22.004
OTHER CAMPUSES ARE OTHER- YOUNG

01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:24.774
PEOPLE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE

01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:27.009
ARE. IN WORK AND IN EDUCATION

01:02:27.076 --> 01:02:30.379
WHO HAD A TREMENDOUS BURDEN AND

01:02:30.446 --> 01:02:32.215
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TOOLS. FOR

01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:34.484
THAT POPULATION TO REALLY SERVE

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:37.086
THE NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE- SO-

01:02:37.153 --> 01:02:39.422
YOU KNOW THIS FOCUS ON. THAT

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:42.225
ENTIRE SPAN AGE SPAN- AND

01:02:42.291 --> 01:02:43.659
UNDERSTANDING THAT WHAT WORKS

01:02:43.726 --> 01:02:45.094
FROM ZERO TO THREE IS QUITE

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:47.930
DIFFERENT THAT WHAT WORKS FROM

01:02:47.997 --> 01:02:48.631
TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE. AND A

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:51.767
KNOWLEDGE GENE HOW NIMBLE AND

01:02:51.834 --> 01:02:53.369
THE TOTAL THESE TOOLS REALLY

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:55.905
HAVE TO BE COME. OVER TIME AND

01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:57.206
THAT'S THE KEY PIECE IT WILL

01:02:57.273 --> 01:02:59.142
TAKE SOME TIME TO DEVELOP THESE

01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:01.010
PROPERLY. IN THE EVIDENCE BASED

01:03:01.077 --> 01:03:03.513
HIGH QUALITY SCALABLE WAY BUT

01:03:03.579 --> 01:03:05.548
IN THE MEANTIME WE DO HAVE.

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:08.284
OTHER SOLUTIONS OTHER PROGRAMS

01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:11.287
THAT. EVEN IF SOMEWHAT POORLY

01:03:11.354 --> 01:03:13.356
COORDINATED BECAUSE OF THE

01:03:13.422 --> 01:03:14.924
NATURE OF. DIFFERENT WAYS

01:03:14.991 --> 01:03:16.392
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HAS BEEN

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:17.693
DELIVERED ACROSS OUR STATE FOR

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.562
YOUNG PEOPLE SOME COUNTIES WITH

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:21.764
THE RICH MENU OF SERVICES IN

01:03:21.831 --> 01:03:24.400
ANOTHER COUNTY IS. NOT SO MANY.

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:26.769
AND SO TAKING WHAT IS ALREADY

01:03:26.836 --> 01:03:28.104
IN PLACE AND LOOKING WHERE

01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:30.406
THOSE INVESTMENTS CAN BE MADE-

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:33.342
SENATOR PAN YOU MENTIONED- THE

01:03:33.409 --> 01:03:36.279
IMPORTANCE OF- THE- BEHAVIORAL

01:03:36.345 --> 01:03:38.381
HEALTH INVESTMENTS IN SCHOOLS.

01:03:38.447 --> 01:03:40.349
WE HAD A JANUARY PROPOSAL THAT

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:43.019
IS STILL PART OF. THE OVERALL

01:03:43.085 --> 01:03:44.987
BUDGET AND LOOKS TO CREATE

01:03:45.054 --> 01:03:47.990
MEANINGFUL PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN

01:03:48.057 --> 01:03:50.459
MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PROGRAMS-

01:03:50.526 --> 01:03:52.328
COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AS

01:03:52.395 --> 01:03:54.230
WELL AS SCHOOLS SO THAT THEY

01:03:54.297 --> 01:03:58.834
CAN IMMEDIATELY. BUILDING

01:03:58.901 --> 01:03:59.635
CONNECTIONS THE RELAY CHEN

01:03:59.702 --> 01:04:01.404
CHIPS THE IN. IS TO GET OUNG

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:03.439
WITH NEEDS A MEETING CONNECTED

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:04.840
I THINK WHAT WE RUN INTO

01:04:04.907 --> 01:04:06.409
CONSISTENTLY AND THIS IS THE

01:04:06.475 --> 01:04:08.477
HARD PIECE TO SOLVE OVERNIGHT

01:04:08.544 --> 01:04:10.580
IS THAT WORK FOR SHORTAGE THERE

01:04:10.646 --> 01:04:13.749
WILL BE CONTINUED TO BE WAIT

01:04:13.816 --> 01:04:15.718
FOR SOME OF THOSE PROFESSIONAL

01:04:15.785 --> 01:04:18.621
SERVICES SO. AS WE TURN TO

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.556
INVESTING IN ADDITIONAL

01:04:20.623 --> 01:04:22.592
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

01:04:22.658 --> 01:04:23.859
REALLY BUILDING UP THEIR

01:04:23.926 --> 01:04:25.428
INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH THIS

01:04:25.494 --> 01:04:27.296
PROPOSAL AND EVEN THOUGH SOME

01:04:27.363 --> 01:04:28.998
OF THE COMPONENTS WILL BE

01:04:29.065 --> 01:04:32.301
COMPLETE INTEL- YOU KNOW A YEAR

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:35.004
OR TWO. DOWN THE ROAD WE CAN

01:04:35.071 --> 01:04:36.405
START TO TAKE PARTS OF THESE

01:04:36.472 --> 01:04:37.974
PROGRAMS AND PUT THEM INTO

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.875
PLACE RIGHT AWAY WE'VE TALKED

01:04:39.942 --> 01:04:42.111
ABOUT POTENTIAL FOR BUILDING ON

01:04:42.178 --> 01:04:44.880
SOME OF THE EXISTING PLATFORMS

01:04:44.947 --> 01:04:46.916
WE HAVE ACCOUNTS HOPE. THAT

01:04:46.983 --> 01:04:49.018
EXISTS WAS BUILT UP FOR THE

01:04:49.085 --> 01:04:51.587
PANDEMIC THAT COULD BE INVESTED

01:04:51.654 --> 01:04:53.356
IN AND THEN OF COURSE AT THE

01:04:53.422 --> 01:04:54.690
PARENT DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED

01:04:54.757 --> 01:04:56.025
HEALTH CARE WE HAVE THE HELP

01:04:56.092 --> 01:04:58.594
LINE THEY COULD BE A RESOURCE

01:04:58.661 --> 01:05:00.229
AND WE'VE CONSIDERED ALL THAT

01:05:00.296 --> 01:05:01.864
CAN BE CALM AND EVOLVE INTO

01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:03.266
SOMETHING. THAT COULD BE

01:05:03.332 --> 01:05:05.368
IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE TO

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:07.536
FAMILIES I DO THINK THOUGH THAT

01:05:07.603 --> 01:05:09.872
IT DOES- IT DOES TAKE TIME TO

01:05:09.939 --> 01:05:11.540
SCALE THE COMPREHENSIVE

01:05:11.607 --> 01:05:13.109
SOLUTIONS AND IN THE MEANTIME

01:05:13.175 --> 01:05:14.277
WE CAN MAKE SOME OF THESE

01:05:14.343 --> 01:05:16.112
INVESTMENTS AND I DO THINK THE

01:05:16.178 --> 01:05:17.780
WAY YOU DESCRIBED IT. IS

01:05:17.847 --> 01:05:20.283
EXACTLY RIGHT THAT WILL TAKE

01:05:20.349 --> 01:05:22.218
SOME OF THESE INVESTMENTS NOW

01:05:22.285 --> 01:05:24.186
AND ALLOW THEM TO FLOURISH AND

01:05:24.253 --> 01:05:27.323
BRAID INTO THE BROADER- PLANNED

01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:29.492
AS OUTLINED IN THIS PROPOSED.

01:05:29.558 --> 01:05:31.861
AND THEN- SO FOR EXAMPLE IT'S

01:05:31.927 --> 01:05:33.796
JUST THAT THIS BEHAVIORAL

01:05:33.863 --> 01:05:34.730
HEALTH SERVICES VIRTUAL

01:05:34.797 --> 01:05:41.937
PLATFORM IS THAT PLATFORM-

01:05:42.004 --> 01:05:43.139
CLOSER TO SAY AT. IS THERE A

01:05:43.205 --> 01:05:44.840
FOR CLASS THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS

01:05:44.907 --> 01:05:46.942
ARE WE ESSENTIALLY INVENTING IT

01:05:47.009 --> 01:05:48.311
AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IS

01:05:48.377 --> 01:05:50.079
THAT. THIS IS A PLATFORM YOU

01:05:50.146 --> 01:05:54.417
ENVISION THAT WOULD BE.

01:05:54.483 --> 01:05:59.889
AVAILABLE. MORE BROADLY LET'S

01:05:59.955 --> 01:06:01.057
SAY THAT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST

01:06:01.123 --> 01:06:03.259
FOR LET'S A STATE OR LOCAL GAL

01:06:03.326 --> 01:06:05.194
SERVICES BUT A POTENTIALLY BE

01:06:05.261 --> 01:06:06.662
AVAILABLE MORE BROADLY AS A

01:06:06.729 --> 01:06:08.898
MENTAL HEALTH PLATFORM FOR

01:06:08.964 --> 01:06:10.833
OTHER- MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:14.470
AND SYSTEMS AND SO FORTH- IN

01:06:14.537 --> 01:06:16.739
TERMS OF HELPING DELIVER CARE

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:18.441
SO IT NEEDS THIS. COULD THIS BE

01:06:18.507 --> 01:06:20.943
A PLATFORM ACTUALLY THAT AND

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:23.145
SERVICE ALL PATIENTS NOT JUST

01:06:23.212 --> 01:06:24.680
FOR THE STATE PROGRAM SO I JUST

01:06:24.747 --> 01:06:26.282
AND MAYBE THAT'S EVEN FURTHER

01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:27.717
TO THE FUTURE BUT I WAS JUST

01:06:27.783 --> 01:06:28.951
WONDERING AS TO WHAT THE VISION

01:06:29.018 --> 01:06:29.752
FOR THIS PLATFORM IS THAT AND

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:32.088
IS THERE AN EXISTING MODEL.

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:33.022
THAT YOU'RE BASING THIS-

01:06:33.089 --> 01:06:35.858
PLATFORM IDEA ON OURS THIS-

01:06:35.925 --> 01:06:36.992
THAT'S ACTUALLY UP AND RUNNING

01:06:37.059 --> 01:06:39.729
RIGHT NOW OR IS THIS A IT IS AN

01:06:39.795 --> 01:06:41.130
INNOVATION THAT WERE TRYING TO

01:06:41.197 --> 01:06:43.866
BUILD ON A CREATE. HERE AND

01:06:43.933 --> 01:06:47.870
STATE. SO BOB IT IS BOTH RIGHT

01:06:47.937 --> 01:06:51.407
SO THERE ARE. TWO MODELS OF A

01:06:51.474 --> 01:06:53.209
PROGRAM LIKE THIS THERE IS SOME

01:06:53.275 --> 01:06:56.345
WORK IN THE UK AND THE DOG MORE

01:06:56.412 --> 01:06:58.414
COMPREHENSIVE MODEL- AND THAT

01:06:58.481 --> 01:07:01.150
YOU CAME OUT IT WAS REALLY. FOR

01:07:01.217 --> 01:07:04.653
COLLEGE AGE- HIGHER AT AGE-

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.188
CITIZENS THERE IN THE UK AND

01:07:06.255 --> 01:07:10.059
THEN CANADA. HAS THE CLOSEST

01:07:10.126 --> 01:07:12.528
MODEL CHáVEZ. MARKETS STEP

01:07:12.595 --> 01:07:15.231
MODEL THAT ALLOWS THE TOOLS TO

01:07:15.297 --> 01:07:17.933
BE AVAILABLE TO ALLOW. PEOPLE

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.835
ARE HARD TO STEP UP THEIR

01:07:19.902 --> 01:07:22.171
NEEDING CARE I THINK THE ISSUE

01:07:22.238 --> 01:07:24.707
HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT THIS

01:07:24.774 --> 01:07:26.976
IS BROADLY AND WIDELY GOING TO

01:07:27.042 --> 01:07:28.444
BE AVAILABLE TO YOUNG PEOPLE TO

01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:30.346
YOUR POINT IS IT JUST FOCUSED

01:07:30.413 --> 01:07:32.715
ON PUBLIC PROGRAMS OR THOSE WHO

01:07:32.782 --> 01:07:34.383
HAVE ACCESS TO PUBLIC PROGRAMS

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:36.886
NO IT IS MEANT TO BE AVAILABLE

01:07:36.952 --> 01:07:38.020
FOR ALL YOUNG PEOPLE IN

01:07:38.087 --> 01:07:40.823
CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW AND I YOU

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:42.425
KNOW AGAIN THAT PERSONAL

01:07:42.491 --> 01:07:45.461
EXPERIENCE WHERE- SOME

01:07:45.528 --> 01:07:48.030
INDIVIDUALS EVEN WITH THE BEST

01:07:48.097 --> 01:07:50.099
HEALTH COVERAGE OFTEN RUN INTO

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:52.134
SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT

01:07:52.201 --> 01:07:53.969
CHALLENGES GETTING THE BAY FOR

01:07:54.036 --> 01:07:55.838
ALL HEALTH CARE AND SERVICES

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:58.207
THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE NEED-

01:07:58.274 --> 01:08:01.644
EVEN EVEN HARDER SOMETIMES THAN

01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:03.946
THOSE WITHIN THE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:08:04.013 --> 01:08:05.281
AND PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:08:05.347 --> 01:08:07.349
SYSTEM SO REALLY MAKING SURE

01:08:07.416 --> 01:08:09.218
THAT THIS PLATFORM. IS THE

01:08:09.285 --> 01:08:12.221
GATEWAY OF THE FRONT DOOR FOR

01:08:12.288 --> 01:08:13.923
ALL YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO

01:08:13.989 --> 01:08:15.891
ACCESS CARE SO THAT IS

01:08:15.958 --> 01:08:17.393
SOMETHING THAT WE HOPE WILL

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:19.295
BUILD AND EVOLVE OVER TIME AND

01:08:19.361 --> 01:08:21.263
WILL REQUIRE ADOPTING

01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:23.599
CONVERSATIONS WITH PARTNERS NOT

01:08:23.666 --> 01:08:26.402
JUST. IN GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO

01:08:26.469 --> 01:08:29.505
WITHIN THE BROAD HEALTH PLAN

01:08:29.572 --> 01:08:33.742
AND. HEALTH- PROVIDER COMMUNITY-

01:08:33.809 --> 01:08:35.077
AND THEN- MAY JUST A FEW MORE

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:36.378
COMMENTS- AT AN AS YET AND SAID

01:08:36.445 --> 01:08:37.346
REALIZE WE COULD SPEND ALL

01:08:37.413 --> 01:08:39.181
AFTERNOON TALKING ABOUT THIS-

01:08:39.248 --> 01:08:40.816
BUT- KNOWING THAT WE- DON'T

01:08:40.883 --> 01:08:44.153
HAVE THAT KIND OF TIME. YOU

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.287
KNOW APPRECIATE THE INVEST IN

01:08:45.354 --> 01:08:46.655
THE WORK FORCE I WOULD MAKE

01:08:46.722 --> 01:08:48.824
NOTE THAT- DALY AS COMMENTS

01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:51.026
ABOUT ONGOING COSTS- IS

01:08:51.093 --> 01:08:52.695
SOMETHING THAT I. THINK WE NEED

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:55.564
TO BETTER DEFINE- BECAUSE THE

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.233
SERVICE WAY I MEAN THE REASON

01:08:57.299 --> 01:08:57.867
WE HAVE THE WORKFORCE WE HAVE

01:08:57.933 --> 01:08:59.368
IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH YOU KNOW

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:00.970
SOME OF ITS PIPELINE PERHAPS

01:09:01.036 --> 01:09:01.537
AND- THAT'S WHERE THE

01:09:01.604 --> 01:09:04.573
INVESTMENT IS GOING HERE. BUT I

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.042
ALSO POINT OUT THAT. YOU CAN

01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:07.676
TRY TO GET MORE PEOPLE INTO THE

01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:10.513
PIPELINE. WHAT HOW MANY PEOPLE

01:09:10.579 --> 01:09:11.814
ACTUALLY ENTER AND THEN HOW

01:09:11.881 --> 01:09:13.015
WHAT THEY'LL DO WHEN THEY COME

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:14.383
OUT THE PIPELINE DEPENDS ON THE

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:15.384
LABOR MARKET WHAT THE WORKING

01:09:15.451 --> 01:09:17.286
CONDITIONS THEY HAVE. IN FACT I

01:09:17.353 --> 01:09:18.621
THINK IN A PREVIOUS HEARING I

01:09:18.687 --> 01:09:20.089
ALSO ASKED NOT ONLY ABOUT THE

01:09:20.155 --> 01:09:22.124
BUILDING THE PIPELINE BUT ALSO

01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:23.192
WHAT ARE WE DOING TO

01:09:23.259 --> 01:09:24.560
INCENTIVIZE. YOU KNOW WHAT IS

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:25.594
THE OVERALL WORK FORCE THAT'S

01:09:25.661 --> 01:09:26.629
OUT THERE HOW MANY PEOPLE

01:09:26.695 --> 01:09:27.897
PERHAPS ACTUALLY HAVE THE

01:09:27.963 --> 01:09:29.498
SKILLS AND TRAINING. BUT

01:09:29.565 --> 01:09:30.432
ACTUALLY AREN'T IN THE FIELD

01:09:30.499 --> 01:09:32.434
ANYMORE BECAUSE THE WORKING

01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:33.702
SITUATION THAT THEY FIND

01:09:33.769 --> 01:09:35.271
THEMSELVES AND IT IS NOT ONE

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:36.539
THAT THEY WERE INTERESTED IN

01:09:36.605 --> 01:09:38.607
OUR DEBT- THEY DECIDE TO FIND

01:09:38.674 --> 01:09:41.277
SOME OTHER. PASSED AND SO- AND

01:09:41.343 --> 01:09:42.645
IT'S ALL THAT SIR RELATED IT TO

01:09:42.711 --> 01:09:44.580
THE ON GOING COST PART BUT YOU

01:09:44.647 --> 01:09:46.348
KNOW WHAT WHAT IS THE YEAH PAY

01:09:46.415 --> 01:09:48.117
AND BENEFITS OF THE FEDERAL

01:09:48.183 --> 01:09:51.587
WORKFORCE THAT WE CAN FIND WAYS

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:53.355
PEOPLE ARE ATTRACTED THOSE TO

01:09:53.422 --> 01:09:55.391
ENTER BUT ALSO PEOPLE TO STAY

01:09:55.457 --> 01:09:57.393
IN BE RETAINED. AND NOT EITHER

01:09:57.459 --> 01:09:59.161
MOVED TO OTHER STATES ARE GO

01:09:59.228 --> 01:10:00.729
YOU KNOW FINE PRINT YES. IT'S

01:10:00.796 --> 01:10:02.765
THAT ARE SO- SO I THINK YOU

01:10:02.831 --> 01:10:06.802
KNOW AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:07.403
ON GOING COST PART. THE DAILY

01:10:07.469 --> 01:10:09.738
APPOINT OUT THAT IS A BIT ILL-

01:10:09.805 --> 01:10:11.006
I THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT

01:10:11.073 --> 01:10:12.541
THAT BECAUSE WE CAN TRY TO GET

01:10:12.608 --> 01:10:13.375
MORE PEOPLE IN THE PIPELINE

01:10:13.442 --> 01:10:14.643
AND- WILL TAKE YEARS FOR PEOPLE

01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:15.778
TO GO THROUGH BUT WHEN THEY

01:10:15.844 --> 01:10:17.546
COME OUT. ARE THEY GOING TO

01:10:17.613 --> 01:10:19.882
FIND THE KIND OF JOBS. THE KIND

01:10:19.949 --> 01:10:22.651
OF WORK. THAT WE WANT THEM TO

01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:24.486
DO. AND ARE WE SUPPORTING THAT

01:10:24.553 --> 01:10:26.522
KIND OF WORK RIGHT- AND I THINK

01:10:26.589 --> 01:10:27.923
THOSE OF US ON PRIMARY CARE AND

01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:29.258
A DOCTOR TELL YOU AND I BOTH

01:10:29.325 --> 01:10:31.527
PRIMARY CARE PEDIATRICIANS. WE

01:10:31.594 --> 01:10:32.294
ALSO KNOW THAT PRIMARY CARE

01:10:32.361 --> 01:10:34.830
PEDIATRICS IS ONE THE LOWEST.

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:37.366
PAID OF ALL THE SPECIALTIES

01:10:37.433 --> 01:10:40.336
AND- THEREFORE- YOU KNOW

01:10:40.402 --> 01:10:42.504
SOMETIMES A YOU HAVE PEOPLE NOT

01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:44.573
YEAH. CITING TO DO OTHER THINGS

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:46.909
BECAUSE- BECAUSE THERE IS FOR

01:10:46.976 --> 01:10:47.776
THE SAME TRAINING THEY COULD

01:10:47.843 --> 01:10:49.545
HAVE OTHER REWARDS ALTHOUGH I'D

01:10:49.612 --> 01:10:50.346
LIKE TO THINK MANY OF US IN

01:10:50.412 --> 01:10:52.181
PEDIATRICS STICK TO OUR GUNS.

01:10:52.247 --> 01:10:54.216
DESPITE THAT- BUT I THINK IT IS

01:10:54.283 --> 01:10:55.351
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO THINK

01:10:55.417 --> 01:10:55.985
ABOUT FROM THE WORKFORCE

01:10:56.051 --> 01:10:57.119
PERSPECTIVE NOT SIMPLY THE

01:10:57.186 --> 01:10:58.854
PIPELINE BUT ALSO THE-

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:00.356
ENDPOINT. AND THEN I GUESS THE

01:11:00.422 --> 01:11:01.390

THE OPTIMISM AND I SEE THE- THE

01:35:42.703 --> 01:35:45.639
DREAM BUT- AND I SEE A LOT OF

01:35:45.706 --> 01:35:47.374
LAND MINES IN IN BETWEEN THE

01:35:47.441 --> 01:35:49.376
IMPLEMENTATION AND JUST A

01:35:49.443 --> 01:35:50.811
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ABOUT THE

01:35:50.878 --> 01:35:52.113
SUBSIDIES ARE ARE YOU TALKING

01:35:52.179 --> 01:35:53.314
ABOUT KATE ACT PEOPLE THAN

01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:55.216
CERTIFICATION ARE YOU TALKING.

01:35:55.282 --> 01:35:58.752
THEY'RE ALSO ABOUT A RANGE OF-

01:35:58.819 --> 01:36:00.888
IT IS A CAREER PATH I GUESS I

01:36:00.955 --> 01:36:02.256
GUESS IS THAT WE WERE TALKING

01:36:02.323 --> 01:36:03.424
ABOUT AND THEN IF WE IF WE DO

01:36:03.491 --> 01:36:05.192
THAT. THEN AGAIN THIS ISSUE OF

01:36:05.259 --> 01:36:06.527
PAY BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT WE

01:36:06.594 --> 01:36:08.295
DON'T WANT TO CREATED A WHOLE.

01:36:08.362 --> 01:36:10.364
GREAT PEOPLE THAT ARE VASTLY

01:36:10.431 --> 01:36:13.934
UNDERPAID- SOMEBODY WITH A

01:36:14.001 --> 01:36:17.805
DEGREE AND THEN. SO ANY ANY

01:36:17.872 --> 01:36:19.206
POTENTIALLY MIGHT BE A QUESTION

01:36:19.273 --> 01:36:21.809
FOR KAREN- WE'RE KIND OF

01:36:21.876 --> 01:36:24.345
THINKING THROUGH THE PROCESS

01:36:24.411 --> 01:36:25.679
THAT WE'RE GOING TO EMBARK ON

01:36:25.746 --> 01:36:27.414
IN ORDER TO REALLY EXAMINE HOW

01:36:27.481 --> 01:36:28.749
TO BUILD OUT THE SUBSTANCE USE

01:36:28.816 --> 01:36:31.585
WORKFORCE THAT WE NEED AND

01:36:31.652 --> 01:36:33.087
WOULD THAT BE SOMETHING THAT

01:36:33.154 --> 01:36:35.289
KAREN COULD SPEAK TO. BUSINESS

01:36:35.356 --> 01:36:38.993
RESULTS. PLEASE. GOOD

01:36:39.059 --> 01:36:41.295
AFTERNOON- WELL I THINK ONE OF

01:36:41.362 --> 01:36:42.296
THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING

01:36:42.363 --> 01:36:43.964
AT AND SPECIFICALLY AROUND

01:36:44.031 --> 01:36:45.933
THAT- AS YOU THE WORK FORCE IS

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.801
HOW TO BUILD A CAREER LADDER

01:36:47.868 --> 01:36:49.170
AND SO I THINK THAT- BECAUSE WE

01:36:49.236 --> 01:36:50.938
RECOGNIZE THAT WE WANT TO BUILD

01:36:51.005 --> 01:36:54.108
A PATHWAY- FROM THE LOWER-

01:36:54.175 --> 01:36:55.509
ENTRY LEVEL POSITIONS AND A

01:36:55.576 --> 01:36:56.877
HIGHER LEVEL POSITION SO THAT'S

01:36:56.944 --> 01:36:58.812
ONE OF THE KEY PIECES OUT OF

01:36:58.879 --> 01:37:03.184
THIS OUR PROPOSAL IS REALLY

01:37:03.250 --> 01:37:08.489
DEVELOPING THAT CAREER LADDER.

01:37:08.556 --> 01:37:09.757
SO WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT QUITE

01:37:09.823 --> 01:37:11.225
SURE ABOUT. SO THAT WE'RE WE'RE

01:37:11.292 --> 01:37:12.059
STILL WE'RE STILL WORKING OUT A

01:37:12.126 --> 01:37:13.761
LOT OF THE DETAILS OF IT. BUT

01:37:13.827 --> 01:37:16.597
BUT I BUT I WOULD CONCUR WITH

YOUR GOAL OF. TRYING TO CREATE

01:37:18.632 --> 01:37:20.734
SOME KIND OF WORKFORCE LADDER-

01:37:20.801 --> 01:37:22.636
THROUGH THIS AND MAKING SURE

01:37:22.703 --> 01:37:23.938
THAT WE PARTNER WITH OUR-

01:37:24.004 --> 01:37:25.372
INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING

01:37:25.439 --> 01:37:27.675
SO WE HAVE THE TRAINING- EASILY

01:37:27.741 --> 01:37:29.843
AND AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE- AND-

01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:31.378
AND WE KNOW IT. IT IT'S A LOT

01:37:31.445 --> 01:37:32.646
OF YEARS AND AN EDUCATION TO

01:37:32.713 --> 01:37:34.682
GET A- AN ADVANCED DEGREE. BUT

01:37:34.748 --> 01:37:35.683
WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE'RE WORKING

01:37:35.749 --> 01:37:36.951
WITH HUMAN BEINGS AND SO IT'S

01:37:37.017 --> 01:37:38.786
IT IS VERY ALSO DELICATE WORK

01:37:38.852 --> 01:37:41.355
AND WHAT WE WANT TO. EXPAND IT

01:37:41.422 --> 01:37:43.390
TO MORE PEER SUPPORT WE- WE

01:37:43.457 --> 01:37:44.758
ALSO LEARNED THAT COMES WITH

01:37:44.825 --> 01:37:46.227
SOME LIABILITIES AS WELL SO

01:37:46.293 --> 01:37:48.195
SUPERVISION WOULD HAVE TO BE AT

01:37:48.262 --> 01:37:52.366
A- HUGE COMPONENT. OF THIS SO.

PEOPLE WHO GRADUATE FROM

01:38:45.052 --> 01:38:46.720
MEDICAL SCHOOLS THEY'VE HAD

01:38:46.787 --> 01:38:48.322
FOUR YEARS OF COLLEGE FOUR

01:38:48.389 --> 01:38:50.224
YEARS OF MEDICAL SCHOOL THERE.

01:38:50.291 --> 01:38:51.292
PRIDED PRETTY WELL IN COLLEGE

01:38:51.358 --> 01:38:52.726
TO GET THE MEDICAL SCHOOL SAID

01:38:52.793 --> 01:38:54.962
PRETTY TALENTED PEOPLE. AND YOU

KNOW THEY SHOW UP AND WE'RE

01:38:56.563 --> 01:38:58.265
GOOD AND WE- HAVE THEM GO TAKE

01:38:58.332 --> 01:38:59.433
CARE OF PATIENTS BUT WE DON'T

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:01.168
TO SOMEONE TO TAKE CARE OF

01:39:01.235 --> 01:39:02.002
PATIENTS WE KEEP A VERY CLOSE

01:39:02.069 --> 01:39:05.172
EYE ON THEM- BECAUSE- IT'S HARD

01:39:05.239 --> 01:39:07.408
WORK. AND IT'S NOT JUST

01:39:07.474 --> 01:39:09.710
DIFFICULT- THE CONSEQUENCES ARE

01:39:09.777 --> 01:39:10.611
SIGNIFICANT IF THEY MAKE

01:39:10.678 --> 01:39:13.580
MISTAKES. ARE IF THEY'RE WRONG.

01:39:13.647 --> 01:39:15.416
AND SO THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT

01:39:15.482 --> 01:39:16.417
REALLY GOING TO EIGHT YEARS OF

01:39:16.483 --> 01:39:18.252
TRAINING AND BY THE WAY EVEN

01:39:18.319 --> 01:39:19.119
WHEN THEY'RE FINISHED THEY'RE

01:39:19.186 --> 01:39:21.188
ADDITIONAL THREE YEARS OF- IN

01:39:21.255 --> 01:39:23.490
PERSON EXPERIENCE- THEY'RE

01:39:23.557 --> 01:39:25.225
STILL NOT QUALIFIED TO TRAIN

01:39:25.292 --> 01:39:27.895
THIS. AS AN EXPERT AND

01:39:27.961 --> 01:39:31.565
SPECIALIST IN- BEHAVIOR

01:39:31.632 --> 01:39:32.099
DEVELOPMENT THAT'S ANOTHER

01:39:32.166 --> 01:39:33.434
THREE YEARS OF TRAINING. AND I

01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:34.702
ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT ONE OF YOUR

01:39:34.768 --> 01:39:35.803
TRAINING PROGRAMS HERE'S

01:39:35.869 --> 01:39:37.471
ACTUALLY TO TAKE THESE VERY

01:39:37.538 --> 01:39:38.939
SAME PEOPLE WHO'VE GONE THROUGH

01:39:39.006 --> 01:39:41.308
THAT MUCH TRAINING- FOUR YEARS

01:39:41.375 --> 01:39:42.276
FOUR YEARS OF COLLEGE FOUR

01:39:42.343 --> 01:39:43.610
YEARS OF MEDICAL SCHOOL THREE

01:39:43.677 --> 01:39:45.245
YEARS OF RESIDENCY. AND SAY

01:39:45.312 --> 01:39:46.847
THAT- BY THE WAY YOU NEED EVEN

01:39:46.914 --> 01:39:48.916
MORE TRAINING TO TAKE CARE OF

01:39:48.982 --> 01:39:49.416
MODERATE BEHAVIOR HEALTH

01:39:49.483 --> 01:39:51.318
CONDITIONS. AND ACTUALLY YOU

01:39:51.385 --> 01:39:52.319
KNOW THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY AN

01:39:52.386 --> 01:39:54.154
ACCURATE BECAUSE THE SONG IS

01:39:54.221 --> 01:39:54.888
ACTUALLY DONE MY FELLOWSHIP

01:39:54.955 --> 01:39:57.124
TRAINING. THE THING THAT I

01:39:57.191 --> 01:39:58.459
REALIZE IS THAT IT'S YOU KNOW

01:39:58.525 --> 01:40:00.928
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS SOME YOU

01:40:00.994 --> 01:40:02.463
KNOW IT'S NOT SIMPLE. IT'S

01:40:02.529 --> 01:40:06.767
CHALLENGING. AND SO THE

01:40:06.834 --> 01:40:08.369
QUESTION STARTS TO RAISES THAT

01:40:08.435 --> 01:40:09.970
NOT I GET YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING

01:40:10.037 --> 01:40:12.172
TO BUILD UP THE WORK FORCE IS

01:40:12.239 --> 01:40:13.574
THAT THESE HEALTHCOACHES AND

01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:15.576
COUNSELORS YOU YOU TALK ABOUT

01:40:15.642 --> 01:40:17.945
INTENSIVE TRAINING BUT THEY'RE

01:40:18.011 --> 01:40:21.248
UNLICENSED. SO THAT SEEMS TO BE

01:40:21.315 --> 01:40:24.985
AN OXYMORON. HOWARD INTENSIVELY

01:40:25.052 --> 01:40:26.887
TRAINED I MEAN I GUESS WE KEEP

01:40:26.954 --> 01:40:28.489
WE DON'T HAVE THE STAFF TO GIVE

01:40:28.555 --> 01:40:29.156
A LICENSE FOR INTENSIVE

01:40:29.223 --> 01:40:31.825
TRAINING BUT HOW DO YOU SAY

01:40:31.892 --> 01:40:33.861
DON'T TENTATIVELY TRAINED. AND

01:40:33.927 --> 01:40:34.628
DOESN'T NECESSARY HAVE TO LEAD

01:40:34.695 --> 01:40:36.697
TO LICENSE SO WHAT IS THIS

01:40:36.764 --> 01:40:37.765
INTENSIVE TRAINING HOW MANY

01:40:37.831 --> 01:40:39.400
YEARS HOW MANY HOURS OF

01:40:39.466 --> 01:40:40.768
TRAINING IS INTENSIVE TRAINING

01:40:40.834 --> 01:40:43.370
BEFORE WE UNLEASH THEM. ONTO A

01:40:43.437 --> 01:40:46.173
BUNCH OF. STUDENTS AND CHILDREN

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:50.110
IN SCHOOLS. RIGHT AND- I'LL

01:40:50.177 --> 01:40:52.246
TELL YOU AGAIN AS A AS A AS AN

01:40:52.312 --> 01:40:53.080
AT THE HOUSE AS A PROGRAM

01:40:53.147 --> 01:40:55.382
DIRECTOR- THE THING THAT ALWAYS

01:40:55.449 --> 01:40:58.051
WORRIES ME MOST WERE THE

01:40:58.118 --> 01:41:00.220
RESIDENTS WHO THOUGHT THEY KNEW

01:41:00.287 --> 01:41:02.556
MORE THAN THEY REALLY DD. AND

01:41:02.623 --> 01:41:03.123
THOSE ARE THE ONES I HAD TO

01:41:03.190 --> 01:41:05.459
KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON RIGHT- LATE

01:41:05.526 --> 01:41:07.327
DEL SO SOMETIMES KNOWING JUST

01:41:07.394 --> 01:41:08.662
ENOUGH IS ACTUALLY MORE

01:41:08.729 --> 01:41:09.797
DANGEROUS BECAUSE YOU DON'T

01:41:09.863 --> 01:41:11.832
REALIZE THE LIMITS OF WHAT YOU

01:41:11.899 --> 01:41:13.867
KNOW OR DON'T KNOW. SO WHAT I'M

01:41:13.934 --> 01:41:15.502
CONCERNED ABOUT IS WERE RUSHING

01:41:15.569 --> 01:41:16.437
TO GET THE BUT WE'RE GONNA

01:41:16.503 --> 01:41:17.571
CREATE THIS PROGRAM THAT

01:41:17.638 --> 01:41:19.239
DOESN'T EXIST RIGHT SO WE CAN

01:41:19.306 --> 01:41:20.774
VENT THIS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:41:20.841 --> 01:41:22.976
COACH OR WHATEVER. AND THEN

01:41:23.043 --> 01:41:24.545
WE'RE GOING TO DO WHAT AND I

01:41:24.611 --> 01:41:25.913
AGAIN I'M INTERESTED IN THE

01:41:25.979 --> 01:41:27.147
QUESTION AS TO HOW MUCH

01:41:27.214 --> 01:41:28.482
TRAINING TO GO TO HAVE THEIR

01:41:28.549 --> 01:41:30.250
OWN LICENSED OKAY BUT EXACTLY

01:41:30.317 --> 01:41:31.385
HOW MUCH TRAINING IS

01:41:31.452 --> 01:41:33.320
INTENSIFIED THE WORD INTENSIVE.

01:41:33.387 --> 01:41:35.322
WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF THAT.

01:41:35.389 --> 01:41:38.225
AND THEN- I WONDER IN THESE

01:41:38.292 --> 01:41:41.161
SCHOOLS. RT UNSUPERVISED- IS

01:41:41.228 --> 01:41:42.463
SOMEONE KEEPING AN EYE ON WHAT

01:41:42.529 --> 01:41:44.865
THEY'RE DOING IN CASE THEY- YOU

01:41:44.932 --> 01:41:47.134
OVER EXTEND THEMSELVES. IS

01:41:47.201 --> 01:41:49.203

01:41:49.269 --> 01:41:50.704
BE A MASTER YOU KNOW SOMEONE

01:41:50.771 --> 01:41:52.606
WHO ACTUALLY HAS PROFESSIONAL

01:41:52.673 --> 01:41:53.240
TRAINING IS LICENSE AND

01:41:53.307 --> 01:41:56.109
ACCOUNTABLE- TERMS OF THEIR-

01:41:56.176 --> 01:41:59.713
THEIR- YET TO MONITOR HOW MANY

01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:00.614
OF HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE

01:42:00.681 --> 01:42:01.782
SUPERVISING YOU KNOW HOW MANY.

01:42:01.849 --> 01:42:03.250
HOW HOW MANY PROFESSIONALLY

01:42:03.317 --> 01:42:04.151
LICENSE PROFESSIONALS CAN BE

01:42:04.218 --> 01:42:05.786
WATCHING OVER THEM SO THAT A

01:42:05.853 --> 01:42:07.154
PERSON CAN HAVE TWELVE OF THEM

01:42:07.221 --> 01:42:09.089
KEEP AN EYE ON THE TWO GOT IT

01:42:09.156 --> 01:42:11.792
FOR OR HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE. SO

01:42:11.859 --> 01:42:14.661
SO I APPRECIATE THE GENERAL

01:42:14.728 --> 01:42:16.363
IDEA YOU TRY OKAY HOW CAN WE

01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:17.865
TRY TO RUSH THIS WORK FORCE BUT

01:42:17.931 --> 01:42:19.266
I ALSO WANT BE VERY CAUTIOUS

01:42:19.333 --> 01:42:20.567
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE TELLING PEOPLE

THEY'RE ACTUALLY GETTING. AND I

01:42:22.636 --> 01:42:23.704
DID AND I DID BY THE WAY I DO

01:42:23.770 --> 01:42:24.805
AGREE THAT WHAT WE SHOULD BE

01:42:24.872 --> 01:42:25.806
THINKING ABOUT HOW WE BUILD A

01:42:25.873 --> 01:42:27.074
CAREER LADDER SO I'M NOT SAYING

01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:28.275
THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE WHO

01:42:28.342 --> 01:42:29.443

01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:30.544
IN TRYING TO GET THEM AND

01:42:30.611 --> 01:42:32.246
OPPORTUNITY. AND ALSO BE ABLE

01:42:32.312 --> 01:42:33.447

CAREFUL ABOUT. YOU KNOW A- WHAT.

01:42:41.221 --> 01:42:42.556
KIND OF EXPECTATIONS WERE

01:42:42.623 --> 01:42:44.525
SETTING ON THE PEOPLE RECEIVING

01:42:44.591 --> 01:42:45.225
THOSE SERVICES AND WHAT THESE

01:42:45.292 --> 01:42:46.927
PEOPLE CAN DO. NOT ONLY THE

ALSO EVEN THE TEACHERS AND

01:42:49.196 --> 01:42:50.898
OTHER STAFF IN THE SCHOOL. BUT

01:42:50.964 --> 01:42:52.299

BEHAVIORAL ISSUES. I HAD

01:43:04.378 --> 01:43:05.178
PARENTS BECAUSE THEY HAD TO

HELP ANSWERED THAT HELP ME

01:43:31.905 --> 01:43:33.740
UNDERSTAND. WHAT'S INTENSIVE

01:43:33.807 --> 01:43:34.942
TRAINING MEAN. WHO'S

01:43:35.008 --> 01:43:36.376

STANDARDS ARE WE PUTTING ON

COUNSELORS. SO- WAIT WAIT COACH

01:43:44.818 --> 01:43:49.723
IS- I THINK WHAT I MEAN SO WHEN

01:43:49.790 --> 01:43:52.759
USING THE TERM INTENSIVE- THESE

01:43:52.826 --> 01:43:54.528
ATTENTION YOUR INVISION TO BE

01:43:54.595 --> 01:43:58.799
FULL TIME. TWELVE TO SIXTEEN TO

01:43:58.865 --> 01:43:59.800
TWENTY FOUR WEEKS OF FORTY

01:43:59.866 --> 01:44:03.570
HOURS OR FORTY HOURS A WEEK AT

01:44:03.637 --> 01:44:05.439
TRAINING AND TWENTY- ATTORNEYS

01:44:05.505 --> 01:44:07.307
ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT BE

01:44:07.374 --> 01:44:09.810
SUPERVISED THE- THEIR TRAINING.

01:44:09.876 --> 01:44:12.045
IS SIMPLY TO GET THEM INTO A

01:44:12.112 --> 01:44:13.313
PLACE WHERE THEY CAN BEACH

01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:15.782
SUPERVISED FOR UP TO TWO YEARS

01:44:15.849 --> 01:44:18.151
BY A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL-

01:44:18.218 --> 01:44:20.287
KIND OF LIKE A AND ON THE JOB I

01:44:20.354 --> 01:44:22.022
DON'T SEE IT ON THE JOB IN

01:44:22.089 --> 01:44:23.657
SOCIAL WORK WE DO THAT WE HAVE

TO GET OUR FIVE THOUSAND HOURS.

01:44:25.592 --> 01:44:29.730
SO AGAIN AT THE IDEA IS TO HAVE

01:44:29.796 --> 01:44:32.299
SOME CLASSROOMS SO TO SPEAK

01:44:32.366 --> 01:44:34.534
INTENSIVE TRAINING BUT THEN TO

01:44:34.601 --> 01:44:37.237
REALLY- WORK WITH A MORE

01:44:37.304 --> 01:44:38.572
PROFESSIONAL STAFF STAFF THAT

01:44:38.639 --> 01:44:39.840
LEADS THAT THEY COULD REFER

01:44:39.906 --> 01:44:41.375
CLIENTS TO A PART OF A LOT OF

01:44:41.441 --> 01:44:42.643
THAT TRAINING IS EXACTLY WHAT

01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:44.344
YOU JUST MENTIONED. AND THEY'RE

01:44:44.411 --> 01:44:46.246
IDENTIFYING SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

01:44:46.313 --> 01:44:48.949
AND THEY'RE RECOGNIZING- WHEN

01:44:49.016 --> 01:44:51.018
THEY SHOULD WORK FOR THE YOUNG

01:44:51.084 --> 01:44:54.888
PERSON TO A PROFESSIONAL AND SO

01:44:54.955 --> 01:44:57.090
IT REALLY IS- GETTING BACK TO

01:44:57.157 --> 01:44:58.692
THAT ORIGINAL CONCEPT WE TALKED

01:44:58.759 --> 01:44:59.926
OF AT THE BEGINNING OF THE

01:44:59.993 --> 01:45:01.895
HEARING WHICH IS. IN POWER IN

01:45:01.962 --> 01:45:04.598
MORE THAN ABILITY TO IDENTIFY

01:45:04.665 --> 01:45:06.767
AND WORK FOR AN OPENING THAT

01:45:06.833 --> 01:45:09.036
DOOR SO THAT. MORE PEOPLE ARE

01:45:09.102 --> 01:45:10.570
GOING TO HAVE AN ABILITY TO

01:45:10.637 --> 01:45:12.806
HAVE A WARM HAND OFF TO THE

01:45:12.873 --> 01:45:14.508
CARE THAT THEY NEED SO IF IT

01:45:14.574 --> 01:45:16.109
WAS THAT FOR TRADE THAT THE

01:45:16.176 --> 01:45:17.344
COACHES THEMSELVES WOULD BE

01:45:17.411 --> 01:45:19.446
DELIVERING A VARIETY OF

01:45:19.513 --> 01:45:20.747
DIFFERENT TYPES OF CARE THAT

01:45:20.814 --> 01:45:22.382
WAS CLINICALLY BASED I DO

01:45:22.449 --> 01:45:23.784
APOLOGIZE FOR THAT THAT'S NOT

01:45:23.850 --> 01:45:25.986
NECESSARILY WHAT WE DO. BEST

01:45:26.053 --> 01:45:28.689
THESE COACHES OKAY CLARIFIED

01:45:28.755 --> 01:45:30.390
AND- SO I'M JUST TRYING

01:45:30.457 --> 01:45:32.325
MANAGING THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS

01:45:32.392 --> 01:45:33.994
A YEAR IN SCHOOL YOUR CHILD

01:45:34.061 --> 01:45:35.829
APPEARS TO HAVE SOME BEHAVIORAL

01:45:35.896 --> 01:45:43.503
ISSUES NOT DOING WELL IN SCHOOL.

01:45:43.570 --> 01:45:44.171
PERHAPS NOW ACTING OUT SOMEWHAT.

01:45:44.237 --> 01:45:45.939
THERE'S THIS BEHAVIOR HOW COACH

01:45:46.006 --> 01:45:47.374
IN THIS SO. OUR DAY IN THE-

01:45:47.441 --> 01:45:48.775
WATCHING. ARE TEACH. THEN HAVE

01:45:48.842 --> 01:45:51.945
TO REFER TO THEM PRINCIPLES-

01:45:52.012 --> 01:45:54.715
AND THEN AND THEN WHO'S AND

01:45:54.781 --> 01:45:55.816
THEN THE SUPERVISION IS THAT IN

01:45:55.882 --> 01:45:57.217
PERSON SUPERVISION AT THE

01:45:57.284 --> 01:45:58.719
SCHOOL SO WE'RE GONNA BE SURE

01:45:58.785 --> 01:46:00.053
WE HAVE A LICENSED HEALTH FOR.

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:01.254
A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL TO

01:46:01.321 --> 01:46:03.190
SCHOOL SO HE JUST I JUST I GET

01:46:03.256 --> 01:46:05.559
BETTER MORE CONCRETE HE'S IDEA

01:46:05.625 --> 01:46:07.160
ABOUT EXACTLY WHERE THESE

01:46:07.227 --> 01:46:09.362
COACHES SIT AND HOW THEY GET

01:46:09.429 --> 01:46:11.598
THERE HOW DID HE GET THE PEOPLE

01:46:11.665 --> 01:46:13.700
IN FRONT OF THEM AND THEN. AND

01:46:13.767 --> 01:46:15.602
OF COURSE THEN DAY HOPEFULLY

01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:17.204
THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.771
MAKE A REFERRAL TO A LICENSE

01:46:17.838 --> 01:46:20.073
PROFESSIONAL BUT- HOUSE AT

01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:21.041
SEQUENT EVENT SUPPOSED TO

01:46:21.108 --> 01:46:22.809
HAPPEN OKAY AND LET ME- BEFORE

01:46:22.876 --> 01:46:23.944
YOU TRY TO ANSWER THAT MUST

01:46:24.010 --> 01:46:24.811
MISS WORK BECAUSE THAT BECAUSE

01:46:24.878 --> 01:46:26.513
I DON'T KNOW OR BUTTONS RIGHT I

01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:27.314
DON'T KNOW THAT ANYBODY CAN

01:46:27.380 --> 01:46:28.348
REALLY ANSWER THAT RIGHT NOW I

01:46:28.415 --> 01:46:30.083
THINK YOU ARE STILL IN A-

01:46:30.150 --> 01:46:32.219
CONCEPTUAL PHASE AS AS I

01:46:32.285 --> 01:46:34.054
UNDERSTAND IT. AND SO I THINK

01:46:34.121 --> 01:46:35.922
WHAT YOU SHOULD TAKE FROM THIS

01:46:35.989 --> 01:46:36.690
IS THAT THERE ARE SOME

01:46:36.757 --> 01:46:39.426
CONCERNS- I WILL ALSO SAY THAT

01:46:39.493 --> 01:46:41.728
AS A PEOPLE I STARTED OFF

01:46:41.795 --> 01:46:44.464
BEFORE I WAS LICENSED- AND I

01:46:44.531 --> 01:46:46.066
WORKED IN THE SUBSIDIES PROGRAM

01:46:46.133 --> 01:46:47.334
I WORKED IN A THERAPEUTIC LONG

01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:49.503
TERM SUBSIDIES PROGRAM. THE

01:46:49.569 --> 01:46:50.537
FIRST TIME I EVER HEARD THE

01:46:50.604 --> 01:46:52.439
WORD THAT SOCIAL WORKER A CAME

01:46:52.506 --> 01:46:55.008
WITHIN AN M. F. IN FRONT OF IT-

01:46:55.075 --> 01:46:56.409
PARA PROFESSIONAL WAS ASKING ME

01:46:56.476 --> 01:46:58.845
ABOUT WHAT I WAS BECAUSE HE

01:46:58.912 --> 01:47:00.680
THOUGHT I WAS BEING TOO KIND-

01:47:00.747 --> 01:47:02.182
SO I KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE COME

01:47:02.249 --> 01:47:05.852
IN ALL KINDS OF. OF FLAVORS OF-

01:47:05.919 --> 01:47:08.588
OF- EXPERIENCE AND SOMETIMES

01:47:08.655 --> 01:47:09.556
THOSE WITH DIRECT EXPERIENCES

01:47:09.623 --> 01:47:11.491
ARE VERY HELPFUL BUT I ALSO

01:47:11.558 --> 01:47:12.626
THINK IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE

01:47:12.692 --> 01:47:14.661
A REAL A BLAND AND MAKE SURE

01:47:14.728 --> 01:47:16.429
AGAIN THE ISSUE OF SUPERVISION.

01:47:16.496 --> 01:47:18.865
I THINK IT IS IMPERATIVE I KNOW

01:47:18.932 --> 01:47:20.534
IN CLASSROOMS OF A TEACHER CAN

01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:21.668
HAVE A PARA PROFESSIONAL THAT

01:47:21.735 --> 01:47:22.903
IS FANTASTIC AND I KNOW THEY

01:47:22.969 --> 01:47:24.838
ARE OFTEN NOT A DEGREE PEOPLE

01:47:24.905 --> 01:47:26.706
BUT CERTIFIED AND TAKEN SOME

01:47:26.773 --> 01:47:28.575
CLASSES. SO I UNDERSTAND THE

01:47:28.642 --> 01:47:29.743
MODEL I THINK THAT YOU I THINK

01:47:29.810 --> 01:47:31.444
WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT MODEL

01:47:31.511 --> 01:47:32.078
BUT I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE

01:47:32.145 --> 01:47:34.047
A LOT OF QUESTIONS GOING

01:47:34.114 --> 01:47:36.283
FORWARD ABOUT ABOUT SUPERVISION

01:47:36.349 --> 01:47:37.484
AND WHO THESE FOLKS ARE AND

01:47:37.551 --> 01:47:39.653
WHAT THEIR TRAINING IS. AND ALL

01:47:39.719 --> 01:47:40.487
OF THAT BUT I THINK WE ALL

01:47:40.554 --> 01:47:42.956
UNDERSTAND. THE NEED FOR A

01:47:43.023 --> 01:47:44.825
CAREER LADDER AND WE ALSO

01:47:44.891 --> 01:47:46.393
UNDERSTAND THAT EVERYBODY IS

01:47:46.459 --> 01:47:47.861
NOT GOING TO BE A DEGREED

01:47:47.928 --> 01:47:53.800
PROFESSIONAL- BUT. THAT THERE

01:47:53.867 --> 01:47:54.401
WILL BE A CHECKS AND BALANCES

01:47:54.467 --> 01:47:55.468
IS SUPERVISION. BUILT INTO THIS.

01:47:55.535 --> 01:47:58.805
AND THAT WHAT I'M UNDER. YES

01:47:58.872 --> 01:48:00.740
THAT IS OUR GOAL AND AGAIN WHY

01:48:00.807 --> 01:48:03.844
WE- REALLY WANT TO HAVE THAT

01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:04.711
PLANNING HERE TO WORK WITH OUR

01:48:04.778 --> 01:48:07.647
PARTNERS. AND TO DESIGN

01:48:07.714 --> 01:48:09.416
SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO.

01:48:09.482 --> 01:48:11.318
HAVE THEIR EXPERTISE OBVIOUSLY

01:48:11.384 --> 01:48:13.687
BUT AGAIN HOPEFULLY HELP US IN

01:48:13.753 --> 01:48:16.223
THE IN THE LONG TERM CAPACITY

01:48:16.289 --> 01:48:18.091
YOU HAVE AS A GROUP OF PEOPLE

01:48:18.158 --> 01:48:20.760
WHO CAN COME IN- AND MAYBE BE A

01:48:20.827 --> 01:48:23.763
COACH FOR BURKE WHAT AS LONG AS

01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:25.298
THEY WANT OR POTENTIALLY

01:48:25.365 --> 01:48:26.333
CONTINUE ON WITH THEIR

01:48:26.399 --> 01:48:28.501
EDUCATION. AND THEIR SKILL SETS

01:48:28.568 --> 01:48:32.439

01:48:32.505 --> 01:48:33.573
IT BEING A NEW OPPORTUNITY TO.

01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:35.876
I HAVE A DIFFERENT CHAD.

01:48:38.645 --> 01:48:40.780
THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RECRUIT

01:48:40.847 --> 01:48:41.982
PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT HAVE BEEN

01:48:42.048 --> 01:48:43.583
INTERESTED IN GOING INTO THIS

01:48:43.650 --> 01:48:47.487
FIELD AND OR- REALLY WANT TO

01:49:36.303 --> 01:49:37.971
THAT WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE A

01:49:38.038 --> 01:49:40.340

MENTAL HEALTH WORK. SO ON ONE

01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:15.976

SUPPORTER DON'T SUPPORT THOSE

01:50:55.515 --> 01:50:57.617
TYPE OF ACTIVITIES. AND SO

01:50:59.152 --> 01:51:00.153
OUTSIDE YOUR DEPARTMENT BUT

01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:01.788
BEGAN AS WE'RE BUILDING THIS

01:51:01.855 --> 01:51:03.356
WORKFORCE PIPELINES WE NEED TO

01:51:03.423 --> 01:51:05.792
BE SURE THAT. THEY CAN GO INTO

01:51:05.859 --> 01:51:07.861
POSITIONS. AND THE POSITIONS

01:51:07.927 --> 01:51:09.562
THEMSELVES SUPPORT THE TYPE OF

01:53:10.350 --> 01:53:12.051

RELATIVE TO THE SCALE OF NEED

01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:15.555

THAT SCHEDULE DOES THIS REALLY

01:53:56.596 --> 01:53:57.830
MEAN THE COUNTY'S CANADA

01:53:57.897 --> 01:53:59.799
DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT

01:53:59.866 --> 01:54:00.934
HAVING THESE CONTRACTS AND

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.135
FUNDING IN PLACE WILL ALLOW

THEM TO HAVE SERVICES AVAILABLE

AS IT MOVES FORWARD. CITED

01:54:37.070 --> 01:54:38.538
ABOUT THIS WORK THERE'S

01:54:38.605 --> 01:54:40.273
TREMENDOUS DEMAND ON THE PART

01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:42.642
OF COUNTIES AND SCHOOLS AND AS

01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:43.977

TRUST OF PUBLIC AGENCIES WHICH

01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:56.756
IS COOL. AND SO WE SEE THIS AS

01:54:56.823 --> 01:54:59.192
AN ESSENTIAL STRATEGY TO BE

01:54:59.259 --> 01:55:00.827
VERY RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS

01:55:00.893 --> 01:55:03.263

01:55:03.329 --> 01:55:04.530
OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FEW

01:55:04.597 --> 01:55:05.932
YEARS AS STUDENTS AND THEIR

MORE SPECIFICALLY RE OPENING OF

01:55:10.803 --> 01:55:12.205
SCHOOLS HAVE STRATEGY TO

JUST BROKE QUESTIONS EWING AT

01:55:26.853 --> 01:55:28.588
HOW MANY ADDITIONALLY FUNDED

01:55:28.655 --> 01:55:30.390
GRANT UNCONFIRMED GRANTS CAN WE

01:55:30.456 --> 01:55:32.492
FUND WITH A- COMBINED FIFTY

01:55:32.558 --> 01:55:38.464
MILLION. WELCOME TO. COME FULLY

01:55:38.531 --> 01:55:40.466
FIND ALL OF THE UNFUNDED

01:55:40.533 --> 01:55:42.035
APPLICATIONS IT'S A LITTLE OVER

01:55:42.101 --> 01:55:43.636
EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS. THAT

01:55:43.703 --> 01:55:45.305
WOULD STILL LEAVE TWENTY

01:55:45.371 --> 01:55:46.239
COUNTIES WHICH ARE PRIMARILY

01:55:46.306 --> 01:55:47.707
SMALL RURAL COUNTIES THAT

01:55:47.774 --> 01:55:50.376
DIDN'T APPLY. THEY DIDN'T APPLY

01:55:50.443 --> 01:55:51.744
FOR A RANGE OF REASONS IN OUR

01:55:51.811 --> 01:55:52.979
OUT REACH TO THEM IN SOME

01:55:53.046 --> 01:55:54.647
INSTANCES THEY WERE IN THE

01:55:54.714 --> 01:55:56.416
MIDDLE OF PREPARING FOR KOBE.

01:55:56.482 --> 01:55:58.184
AND THEY JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE

01:55:58.251 --> 01:55:59.919
TIME TO GO TO THE GRANT

01:55:59.986 --> 01:56:02.288
APPLICATION PROCESS- SOME OF

01:56:02.355 --> 01:56:03.723
THEM FELT THAT THE SCALE OF

01:56:03.790 --> 01:56:05.158
FUNDING WOULD NOT OF BEEN

01:56:05.224 --> 01:56:07.060
SUFFICIENT. RELATIVE TO THE

01:56:07.126 --> 01:56:08.995
WORK THAT IT WOULD TAKE- BAD

01:56:09.062 --> 01:56:10.897
WE'VE CALCULATED THAT TO FULLY

01:56:10.963 --> 01:56:12.899
FUND ALL OF THE APPLICANTS THAT

01:56:12.965 --> 01:56:14.467
WE HAVE WOULD BE SLIGHTLY OVER

01:56:14.534 --> 01:56:17.236
EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS. SO WHY

01:56:17.303 --> 01:56:20.540
NOT ASK FOR THAT. WELL WE WOULD

01:56:20.606 --> 01:56:22.075
CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE

01:56:22.141 --> 01:56:24.277
OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY FIND NOT

01:56:24.344 --> 01:56:26.279
JUST THOSE EIGHTY. BUT ALL

01:56:26.346 --> 01:56:28.014
COUNTIES. ALL COUNTY

01:56:28.081 --> 01:56:29.749
PARTNERSHIPS WHICH WE COULD DO

01:56:29.816 --> 01:56:31.551
VERY QUICKLY IF WE DIDN'T HAVE

01:56:31.617 --> 01:56:32.752
TO DO IF YOUR COMPETITIVE

01:56:32.819 --> 01:56:35.588
PROCUREMENT PROCESS- WE FEEL

01:56:35.655 --> 01:56:37.290
LIKE THAT THAT THE NEED IS

01:56:37.357 --> 01:56:39.158
THERE AND WE HAVE THE RESOURCES

01:56:39.225 --> 01:56:39.692
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN VERY

01:56:39.759 --> 01:56:43.463
QUICKLY- THAT'S NOT WHERE THIS

01:56:43.529 --> 01:56:43.863
CONVERSATION WITH

01:56:43.930 --> 01:56:45.431
ADMINISTRATION LANDED. BUT

01:56:45.498 --> 01:56:46.699
WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE THAT

01:56:46.766 --> 01:56:48.034
CONVERSATION MOVING FORWARD.

01:56:48.101 --> 01:56:50.136
OKAY IT JUST MAKES SENSE AS WE

01:56:50.203 --> 01:56:50.837
KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE

01:56:50.903 --> 01:56:53.005
IMMEDIACY THAT WERE ABLE TO

01:56:53.072 --> 01:56:53.706
FIND AS MANY OF THESE AS WE

01:56:53.773 --> 01:56:55.742
POSSIBLY CAN. ADD A BIT THREE

01:56:55.808 --> 01:56:58.177
COUNTIES I REPRESENT THE ONE

01:56:58.244 --> 01:56:59.846
BUT- NEITHER TWO OF THEM DID

01:56:59.912 --> 01:57:02.181
NOT- AND THE OTHER ONE I JUST

01:57:02.248 --> 01:57:02.749
HAVE A TEENY SLIVER OF THAT

01:57:02.815 --> 01:57:04.484
COUNTY. AND PARTLY IT'S BECAUSE

01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:06.386
THEY'RE- THEY'RE THE COUNTIES

01:57:06.452 --> 01:57:08.020
WITH LESS CAPACITY SOMETIMES

01:57:08.087 --> 01:57:09.155
WITH WHAT WAS STAFF AND

01:57:09.222 --> 01:57:10.923
RESOURCES. AND SO I WOULD ALSO

01:57:10.990 --> 01:57:12.291
AGREED THAT COMPETITIVE GRANT

01:57:12.358 --> 01:57:15.628
CAN MAKE IT- PERHAPS LESS. BUT

01:57:15.695 --> 01:57:16.863
LESS LIKELY FOR SOMEBODY TO

01:57:16.929 --> 01:57:18.531
JUMP IN I'M WONDERING IF WE CAN

01:57:18.598 --> 01:57:19.932
DO SOME KIND OF TIERED SYSTEM

01:57:19.999 --> 01:57:21.167
MICHAEL WE HAVE SOME EXTRA CASH

01:57:21.234 --> 01:57:22.802
WE CAN. FUND A BUNCH MORE

01:57:22.869 --> 01:57:23.369
UNDERSTANDING AT SOME POINT

01:57:23.436 --> 01:57:25.471
DOWN THE ROAD- THEY'LL HAVE TO

01:57:25.538 --> 01:57:29.575
BE. A MATCH BUT PAN. THE LATEST

01:57:29.642 --> 01:57:30.777
PHYSICAL IF WE WERE GOING TO

01:57:30.843 --> 01:57:32.111
FIND ALL THE COUNTIES-

01:57:32.178 --> 01:57:33.780
OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO PRODUCE A

01:57:33.846 --> 01:57:35.381
PROPOSAL OF SUFFICIENT QUALITY

01:57:35.448 --> 01:57:37.750
FOR YOU- HOW MUCH SO YOU SAID

01:57:37.817 --> 01:57:38.251
EIGHTY FOR IF WE FUNDED

01:57:38.317 --> 01:57:40.420
EVERYTHING BUT THEN HOW MUCH

01:57:40.486 --> 01:57:43.156
FOR. ALL THE COUNTIES. ABOUT A

01:57:43.222 --> 01:57:43.790
HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION

01:57:43.856 --> 01:57:47.393
DOLLARS OKAY. AT AT THE SCALE.

01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:49.695
THAT WE HAD OFFERED OUT. IN THE

01:57:49.762 --> 01:57:51.130
INITIAL GRANT JUST TWO AND A

01:57:51.197 --> 01:57:51.998
HALF MILLION FOR SMALL COUNTIES

01:57:52.064 --> 01:57:54.133
FOR. FOR MEDIUM SIZED COUNTIES

01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:55.668
AND SIX FOR LARGE COUNTIES THAT

01:57:55.735 --> 01:57:57.603
RECOGNIZES THAT FOR COUNTY LIKE

01:57:57.670 --> 01:57:58.938
LOS ANGELES SIX MILLION DOLLARS

01:57:59.005 --> 01:58:01.507
IS INSUFFICIENT. BUT IT IS A

ESTIMATE THE PREMIUM COST OF

THOSE COSTS COULD NOT BE LESS

02:05:12.738 --> 02:05:13.272
THAN ONE DOLLAR PER MEMBER PER

ENTIRE PREMIUM COSTS. AS I

02:05:26.418 --> 02:05:28.053
MENTIONED IN THE LAST ISSUE THE

AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ELIMINATES

02:05:30.122 --> 02:05:31.423

MORE AT COVERED CALIFORNIA

02:05:38.530 --> 02:05:40.065

02:05:44.436 --> 02:05:46.705

RESEARCH ON MARKET PLACE

02:05:49.141 --> 02:05:50.209
ENROLLMENT SUGGESTS THAT

02:05:50.276 --> 02:05:51.977
THERE'S A SO CALLED ZERO PRICE

02:05:52.044 --> 02:05:53.946
EFFECT WHERE ENROLLMENT SPIKES

02:05:54.013 --> 02:05:55.814
IN MARKET PLACES ARE THAT HAVE

SO THIS PROPOSAL BUILDS ON THAT

02:06:01.186 --> 02:06:02.288
RESEARCH AND WOULD ALLOW COVER

02:06:02.354 --> 02:06:04.056

02:06:44.463 --> 02:06:45.731
FOR MANY IN SMOOTHING THE

THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC.

OUR OFFICE HAS BEEN FORECASTING

02:17:33.745 --> 02:17:35.580
MUCH LOWER CASE LOADS THEN THE

ADMINISTRATION. AND WHAT WE

02:17:37.549 --> 02:17:38.717
WOULD SAY IS THE MAY REVISION

02:17:38.783 --> 02:17:40.752

02:18:01.606 --> 02:18:03.942
WE DO THINK THAT UPON REVIEW OF

02:18:04.009 --> 02:18:05.176
THE MAY REVISION THERE ARE SOME

02:18:05.243 --> 02:18:06.111

OUR CASELOAD. IT'S MAKING SURE

02:18:13.752 --> 02:18:15.120
THAT THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE ARE

02:18:15.186 --> 02:18:17.355
MORE LIKELY TO COME IN. AND

02:18:17.422 --> 02:18:19.124
THOSE THOSE REALLY THOUGH

02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.858
APPEAR TO HAVE MODEST

02:18:19.924 --> 02:18:22.494
INCREASES. THE FIRST IS THAT

02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:24.062
THE AS MENTIONED ABOVE FIVE

02:18:24.129 --> 02:18:26.598
POINT 3% RATE INCREASE. AT THAT

02:18:26.665 --> 02:18:27.132
WOULD BE PAID FOR OUT OF

02:18:27.198 --> 02:18:28.900
REALIGNMENT REVENUE. WERE

02:18:28.967 --> 02:18:29.501
THINKING THAT THAT COULD

02:18:29.567 --> 02:18:31.503
POTENTIALLY HAVE A MODEST

02:18:31.569 --> 02:18:33.004
INCREASE OF THE CASELOAD OF I'M

02:18:33.071 --> 02:18:35.907
OF MAYBE. A FEW THOUSAND CASES.

02:18:35.974 --> 02:18:38.209
WE WERE ASPECTS I SUBCOMMITTEE

02:18:38.276 --> 02:18:39.844
STAFF TO TALK ABOUT HOW THIS

02:18:39.911 --> 02:18:42.547
GRANT INCREASED I'M HERE IS TO.

02:18:42.614 --> 02:18:44.983
LEGISLATIVE INTENT- AS CHIEF

02:18:45.050 --> 02:18:46.751
DEPUTY DIRECTOR CHOI A MENTION

02:18:46.818 --> 02:18:48.887
TO GET BACK ALL CAO WORKS

02:18:48.953 --> 02:18:51.222
FAMILIES TO FIFTY PERCENT. OF

02:18:51.289 --> 02:18:53.324
THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINE

02:18:53.391 --> 02:18:54.592
FOR A FAMILY THAT IS ONE PERSON

02:18:54.659 --> 02:18:56.294
LARGER THAN A YOU UNIT THE

02:18:56.361 --> 02:18:58.329
ASSISTANCE UNIT. I WILL SAY

02:18:58.396 --> 02:19:00.432
THAT ACTUALLY THAT THE

02:19:00.498 --> 02:19:01.466
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL

02:19:01.533 --> 02:19:03.101
ALTHOUGH IT I MEAN FOR GRANT

02:19:03.168 --> 02:19:05.470
INCREASE FOR OUR FAMILIES SO

02:19:05.537 --> 02:19:06.705
FAR FALLS SHORT OF THE

02:19:06.771 --> 02:19:09.307
LEGISLATURE SCHOOL. OUT BY OUR

02:19:09.374 --> 02:19:10.775
CALCULATIONS IT LOOKS LIKE AN

02:19:10.842 --> 02:19:13.011
AVERAGE SIZE. OUR EX FAMILY

02:19:13.078 --> 02:19:14.345
WOULD RECEIVE ABOUT A FIFTY

02:19:14.412 --> 02:19:16.114
DOLLAR INCREASE UNDER THE

02:19:16.181 --> 02:19:17.716
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. WERE

02:19:17.782 --> 02:19:19.818
UNDER THE LEGISLATURE ALTERNATE

02:19:19.884 --> 02:19:25.457
INTENT THAT. WOULD BE CLOSER TO

02:19:25.523 --> 02:19:26.091
A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS. BY

02:19:26.157 --> 02:19:27.025
THE ADMINISTRATION ARE PER. AT

02:19:27.092 --> 02:19:27.726
USE SOME THE FEDERAL FUNDS TO

02:19:27.792 --> 02:19:29.494
SET TO SEND TO FIX EIGHT.

02:19:29.561 --> 02:19:30.361
HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLAR ONE

02:19:30.428 --> 02:19:31.763
TIME PAYMENTS ALL CAO WORKS

02:19:31.830 --> 02:19:33.965
FAMILIES BEGINNING IN JULY. AND

02:19:34.032 --> 02:19:34.666
THAT'S BUILDING OFF OF A

02:19:34.733 --> 02:19:37.469
PREVIOUSLY. AT SENT HUNDRED

02:19:37.535 --> 02:19:38.803
DOLLAR PAYMENT THAT WAS DONE IN

02:19:38.870 --> 02:19:40.939
THE SPRING AS PART OF THE

02:19:41.005 --> 02:19:42.440
GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS PACKAGE.

02:19:42.507 --> 02:19:43.641
AS CONSTRUCTED ALTHOUGH THIS

02:19:43.708 --> 02:19:45.376
WILL BE A MEANINGFUL INCREASE

02:19:45.443 --> 02:19:46.711
FOR FAMILIES WE DON'T THINK

02:19:46.778 --> 02:19:47.912
IT'S LIKELY TO NECESSARILY HAVE

02:19:47.979 --> 02:19:49.781
A BIG INCREASE IN INCREASING

02:19:49.848 --> 02:19:51.483
THE NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE FAMILIES

02:19:51.549 --> 02:19:53.818
TO APPLY. I FOR THE PROGRAM IS

02:19:53.885 --> 02:19:54.886
SO IF THAT IS OF INTEREST OF

02:19:54.953 --> 02:19:56.755
THE LEGISLATURE- WE WOULD

02:19:56.821 --> 02:19:58.423
RECOMMEND THINKING ABOUT MAYBE

02:19:58.490 --> 02:19:59.691
GIVING YOURSELF A LITTLE BIT OF

02:19:59.758 --> 02:20:00.992
LEAD TIME BEFORE SENDING OUT

02:20:01.059 --> 02:20:02.660
THAT GRANTS. AND PERHAPS

02:20:02.727 --> 02:20:04.496
PACKAGING IT WITH THEM FUNDING

02:20:04.562 --> 02:20:06.564
FOR SOME OUTREACH MONEY. AGAIN

02:20:06.631 --> 02:20:07.565
AS OUR INITIAL COMMENTS WILL

02:20:07.632 --> 02:20:09.267
CONTINUE TO LOOK AT I THINK HOW

02:20:09.334 --> 02:20:11.302
IT WORKS BUDGET AND TRAILER

02:20:11.369 --> 02:20:14.706
BILL AS MORE BECOMES AVAILABLE.

02:20:14.773 --> 02:20:15.240
AND WERE AVAILABLE FOR ANY

02:20:15.306 --> 02:20:16.741
QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU

02:20:16.808 --> 02:20:18.376
VERY MUCH FROM BECCA MYSTERY I

02:20:18.443 --> 02:20:19.911
GUESS DO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY

02:20:19.978 --> 02:20:22.814
COMMENT. YOU GUYS DID YOU ALL

02:20:22.881 --> 02:20:25.383
THINK IT'S UP TO THE- 50% OF

02:20:25.450 --> 02:20:27.018
THE FEDERAL POVERTY AND THE L.

02:20:27.085 --> 02:20:29.287
A. O. HAS A DIFFERENCE OF

02:20:29.354 --> 02:20:32.724
OPINION. OF TIME AND A HALF.

02:20:32.791 --> 02:20:34.192
YEAH I GUESS AND WHAT I WOULD

02:20:34.259 --> 02:20:35.326
SAYIS IT'S NOT SO MUCH A

02:20:35.393 --> 02:20:36.528
DIFFERENCE OF OPINION I THINK

02:20:36.594 --> 02:20:37.729
WE PROBABLY WOULD AGREE WITH

02:20:37.796 --> 02:20:39.631
EACH OTHER ABOUT- BOTH OF THE

02:20:39.697 --> 02:20:40.465
CALCULATIONS THAT WE'RE

02:20:40.532 --> 02:20:42.367
SHARING. BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS

02:20:42.433 --> 02:20:43.568
SIMPLE YET ONE OF A DIFFERENT

02:20:43.635 --> 02:20:45.904
METHODOLOGY OR FORMULA FOR HOW

02:20:45.970 --> 02:20:47.705
TO ACCESS THE GRANDSONS AGAINST

02:20:47.772 --> 02:20:49.707
THE POVERTY LEVEL HISTORICALLY

02:20:49.774 --> 02:20:51.910
IN THE PROGRAM- THE TYPICAL WAY

02:20:51.976 --> 02:20:53.411
THAT WE HAVE DONE THAT IS TO

02:20:53.478 --> 02:20:54.813
ACCESS IT FOR AN ASSISTANCE

02:20:54.879 --> 02:20:57.482
UNIT OF THE EXACT SIZE- OF THE

02:20:57.549 --> 02:20:59.083
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO DO RECEIVE

02:20:59.150 --> 02:21:00.985
IT. BECAUSE THERE IS A LARGE

02:21:01.052 --> 02:21:02.987
NUMBER OF- FAMILIES IN THE

02:21:03.054 --> 02:21:04.489
QUEUE SLOWED WHERE THERE IS AN

02:21:04.556 --> 02:21:07.559
ADULT WHO IS A NATIVE- I THINK

02:21:07.625 --> 02:21:09.360
THE LEGISLATURE HAS OPTED TO

02:21:09.427 --> 02:21:10.895
USE A DIFFERENT FORMULA TO

02:21:10.962 --> 02:21:12.964
ACCOUNT FOR THAT BY ADDING AN

02:21:13.031 --> 02:21:16.568
ADDITIONAL. PERSON TO THE SIZE

02:21:16.634 --> 02:21:17.535
OF THE ASSISTANCE UNIT FOR

02:21:17.602 --> 02:21:18.937
PURPOSES OF COMPARISON SO

02:21:19.003 --> 02:21:20.205
THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT WAYS OF

02:21:20.271 --> 02:21:22.540
LOOKING AT THAT COMPARISON

02:21:22.607 --> 02:21:24.309
THERE IS NO SORT OF ONE

02:21:24.375 --> 02:21:26.211
OFFICIAL WAY TO DO SO. THAT THE

02:21:26.277 --> 02:21:27.312
ADMINISTRATION'S FORMULA

02:21:27.378 --> 02:21:30.114
INCLUDES WHICH INCLUDES- THE

02:21:30.181 --> 02:21:31.950

BACKUP CARE BUT WHAT WE'RE

03:04:30.926 --> 03:04:33.328
LOOKING AT IS SITUATIONS WHERE

03:04:33.395 --> 03:04:35.464
A PROVIDER NEEDS IMMEDIATE

03:04:35.531 --> 03:04:37.232

TO REVIEW IT THOROUGHLY BUT

03:05:56.745 --> 03:05:58.647
JUST AN INITIAL WALK IT DOES

03:05:58.714 --> 03:06:00.616

THOROUGH REVIEW- ON THAT POINT-

03:06:08.423 --> 03:06:10.392
BUT ONE ISSUE THAT WE WOULD

03:06:10.459 --> 03:06:12.528
LIKE TO RAISE TWO IN TERMS OF-

03:06:12.594 --> 03:06:14.596
LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION-

03:06:14.663 --> 03:06:15.631
REVOLVES AROUND THE LONG TERM

03:06:15.697 --> 03:06:17.165
CARE OF CAREER PATHWAYS

03:06:17.232 --> 03:06:19.134
PROPOSAL. AND JUST FOR

03:06:19.201 --> 03:06:20.936
ADDITIONAL CONTACTS AND THE

03:06:21.003 --> 03:06:22.304
CONCEPT OF PROVIDING TRAINING

03:06:24.339 --> 03:06:26.041
PROVIDERS AND STRENGTHENING

03:06:26.108 --> 03:06:27.576
PROP POSSIBLE LINKS BETWEEN THE

03:06:27.643 --> 03:06:29.144
I JUST WORK FORCE AND THE

03:06:29.211 --> 03:06:31.313
BROADER HOME HEALTH WORKFORCE-

ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL MAY TRY

03:06:45.427 --> 03:06:46.995
TO GET A BROADER CONCEPT I

03:06:47.062 --> 03:06:49.164
THINK AT THIS TIME- WE DON'T

03:06:49.231 --> 03:06:50.632
NECESSARILY HAVE THE

03:06:50.699 --> 03:06:52.768

ALONG THOSE LINES I'M

03:06:56.338 --> 03:06:58.574
SPECIFICALLY WE DON'T KNOW- HOW

03:06:58.640 --> 03:06:59.908
THE ADMINISTRATION CAME UP WITH

03:06:59.975 --> 03:07:01.310
THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DLLARS

03:07:01.376 --> 03:07:03.345

03:07:09.952 --> 03:07:11.587
IT THAT'S GONNA- IS REALLY

03:07:11.653 --> 03:07:13.589
ADDRESSING. THE PROBLEM OR

03:07:13.655 --> 03:07:15.223
UNMET NEED WITHIN THE SYSTEM

03:07:15.290 --> 03:07:17.292
AND AGAIN MORE BROADLY WHAT IS

03:07:17.359 --> 03:07:24.399
THE PROBLEM MORE UNMET. NEED

03:07:24.466 --> 03:07:25.033
THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS TRYING TO

03:07:25.100 --> 03:07:26.702

03:07:26.768 --> 03:07:27.636
BE MEASURED. AND AGAIN WE'RE

03:07:27.703 --> 03:07:28.236
STILL IN THE EARLY STAGE OF

03:07:28.303 --> 03:07:29.171
MAIN. SO WE WILL CAN TO WORK

03:07:29.237 --> 03:07:30.439

03:07:30.505 --> 03:07:32.808
ADDITIONAL DETAILS I'M HOWEVER

03:07:32.874 --> 03:07:34.343
IF THE NECESSARY LEVEL OF

03:07:34.409 --> 03:07:36.645
DETAIL CANNOT BE PROVIDED

03:07:36.712 --> 03:07:38.380
WITHIN THE SHORT BUDGET TIME

03:07:38.447 --> 03:07:40.349
FRAME TO THE LEGISLATURE. WE

03:07:40.415 --> 03:07:42.050
CAN ALSO HELP THE LEGISLATURE

03:07:42.117 --> 03:07:43.051
THINK THROUGH POSSIBLE

03:07:43.118 --> 03:07:44.886
ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES IF IT

03:07:44.953 --> 03:07:45.921
WERE INTERESTED IN DOING

03:07:45.988 --> 03:07:47.656
SOMETHING IN THIS SPACE-

03:07:47.723 --> 03:07:48.890
POSSIBLY COMING UP WITH A MORE

03:07:48.957 --> 03:07:51.660
DEFINED. AND ACTIONABLE SHORT

03:07:51.727 --> 03:07:53.962
TERM APPROACH- WHICH MAY NOT

03:07:54.029 --> 03:07:55.430
REQUIRE AS MUCH FUNDING TO

03:07:55.497 --> 03:07:57.132

03:07:59.468 --> 03:08:00.669
IN THE FUTURE YEARS AT THE

03:08:00.736 --> 03:08:02.137
ADMINISTRATION SOLIDIFIES AND

03:08:02.204 --> 03:08:03.672
COMPLETES. THAT MORE LONGER

03:08:03.739 --> 03:08:07.643
TERM STRATEGY. THANK YOU. THANK

CAN SOMEBODY SPEAK TO THE

03:08:11.146 --> 03:08:12.848
CAREER PATHWAYS AND WHAT WHAT

03:08:12.914 --> 03:08:14.216
IS THE GOAL WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO

WHERE WILL FOLKS BE GOING IS

03:08:17.886 --> 03:08:19.488
THE DEPARTMENT CAN OFFER SOME

LEVEL OF TRAINING BUT BUT I

03:08:32.300 --> 03:08:34.002

DOLLARS WHAT WILL. THIS

03:08:43.278 --> 03:08:45.881
ABSOLUTELY IS COMING OUT OF.

03:08:45.947 --> 03:08:46.848
THOSE DISCUSSIONS IN THE MASTER

03:08:46.915 --> 03:08:48.917
PLAN FOR AGING AND THE OVERALL

SYSTEMS FOR CALM. DATING AND

03:36:32.913 --> 03:36:35.782
ANALYSIS. THIS IS CURRENTLY THE

GROUNDWORK. FUTURE UP. AND YOUR

03:36:39.086 --> 03:36:41.455
ENGAGING WITH C. YEAR PROCESS

03:36:41.521 --> 03:36:49.763
WHILE. RIGHT TERMS OF THE

03:36:49.830 --> 03:36:57.137
FUNCTION. THIS IS A DAY SYSTEM

03:36:57.204 --> 03:37:00.574
VISION BACK. WE PROPOSING THAT

03:37:00.640 --> 03:37:02.442
OF BECOME TWO THINGS FOR ONE

03:37:02.509 --> 03:37:05.212
AND CENTRAL ALL THE ACROSS THE

03:37:05.278 --> 03:37:12.018
PROGRAMS- INTO A UNITS.

03:37:12.085 --> 03:37:18.959
MANAGEMENT WOULD STAY OVER. FOR

03:37:19.025 --> 03:37:20.794
A TOOL THAT WOULD HELP MANAGE

03:37:20.861 --> 03:37:23.697
SCHEDULING CAPACITY IN WOMAN'S

03:37:23.764 --> 03:37:26.700
ATTENDANCE SHEETS INVOICES ALL

03:37:26.767 --> 03:37:28.268
OF THOSE THINGS THAT NOT ALL

03:37:28.335 --> 03:37:30.337
PROVIDERS CURRENTLY HAVE BEEN

03:37:30.404 --> 03:37:33.673
AUTOMATED TOOL TO MANAGE SO

03:37:33.740 --> 03:37:36.676
IT'S REALLY TO FALL AND- HAVING

03:37:36.743 --> 03:37:39.679
THE FUNCTIONALITY TO ALLOW FOR

03:37:39.746 --> 03:37:40.747
DATA COLLECTION OF WHAT ITS

03:37:40.814 --> 03:37:42.048
CURRENT REQUIRE CURRENTLY

03:37:42.115 --> 03:37:44.217
REQUIRED AS WELL AS THIS TYPE

03:37:44.284 --> 03:37:46.753
OF EXTENSION WE ALSO ENVISION

03:37:46.820 --> 03:37:48.655
THAT THIS OUR SYSTEM WOULD

03:37:48.722 --> 03:37:53.093
ALLOW FOR. MANAGING AS WELL.

03:37:53.160 --> 03:37:55.595
AND THEN. REGARDING COSTS THE

03:37:55.662 --> 03:37:57.030
STUDENT VISION- WILL BE

03:37:57.097 --> 03:37:59.266
INFORMED BY AN EXTENSIVE

03:37:59.332 --> 03:38:01.134
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS

03:38:01.201 --> 03:38:03.236
AS WELL AS PLANNING SO IT IS

03:38:03.303 --> 03:38:05.739
SUBJECT. STATES I. T. PROJECT

03:38:05.806 --> 03:38:07.340
APPROVAL PROCESS AND THAT'S

03:38:07.407 --> 03:38:09.843
REQUIREMENTS- AND SO WE'RE

03:38:09.910 --> 03:38:11.611
WE'RE THINKING IT IS GOING TO

03:38:11.678 --> 03:38:14.181
BE. AN EIGHTEEN MONTH PROCESS

03:38:14.247 --> 03:38:16.950
TO GET THROUGH. ALL THAT

03:38:17.017 --> 03:38:20.020
PLANNING AND PROCUREMENT- IT IS

03:38:20.086 --> 03:38:21.621
EIGHT A DOCTOR WILL SCALABLE

03:38:21.688 --> 03:38:23.824
SOLUTIONS SO THAT DIFFERENCE IN

03:38:23.890 --> 03:38:25.826
COST WITH HER NEARLY DRIVEN BY

03:38:25.892 --> 03:38:28.462
THE VOLUME OF USER LICENSES

03:38:28.528 --> 03:38:30.530
THAT WE WOULD NEED FOR THE

03:38:30.597 --> 03:38:32.732
TECHNOLOGY SOLUTION. THERE IS-

03:38:32.799 --> 03:38:34.634
I REQUEST THAT AS WE GET

03:38:34.701 --> 03:38:35.602
THROUGH THE APPROVAL PROCESS

03:38:35.669 --> 03:38:36.837
WOULD HAVE PROVISIONAL

03:38:36.903 --> 03:38:38.405
AUTHORITY FOR ANOTHER FOUR

03:38:38.472 --> 03:38:43.276
MILLION TO EXPAND. THE USER

03:38:43.343 --> 03:38:44.978
LICENSES. AND SO WE DON'T A

03:38:45.045 --> 03:38:47.080
COMPLETE ESTIMATE OF COSTS OF

03:38:47.147 --> 03:38:48.582
THIS TIME BUT IT IS- IN THE

03:38:48.648 --> 03:38:50.150
MAIL OF. THE TENDS NOT AS

03:38:50.217 --> 03:38:51.985
OPPOSED TO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

03:38:52.052 --> 03:38:52.719
THAT WE WOULD SEE WITH

03:38:52.786 --> 03:38:55.722
TRADITIONAL MORE COMPLEX.

03:38:55.789 --> 03:38:57.123
SYSTEMS THAT REQUIRE A LOT OF
