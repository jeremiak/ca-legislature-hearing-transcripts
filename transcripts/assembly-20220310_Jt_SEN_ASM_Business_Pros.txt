INJURIES BURNS ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY AND AUDIOLOGY AND HEARING AID DISPENSERS BOARD. WELCOME EVERYONE PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN RATHER PRONOUNCED A PERFECTLY CAN YOU HEAR ME WELL PERFECTLY PLEASE PLEASE PROCEED. OKAY GOOD MORNING TO YOU TOO CHAIRMAN BERMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM DOCTOR MARCIA REGGIE AUDIOLOGIST AND BOARD CHAIR OF THE SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY AUDIOLOGY AND HEARING AID DISPENSERS BOARD AS YOU MENTIONED WITH ME HERE TODAY IS VICE CHAIR HOLLY KAISER WHO'S A SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGIST. PASSENGERS ARE BOARDED SECOND BOXER INJURIES BURNS OUR ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE OFFICER. AS YOU KNOW THE BOARD SERVICE TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC BY LICENSING AND REGULATING SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGISTS AUDIOLOGISTS AND HEARING AID DISPENSERS WHICH MEANS WE ARE THREE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT PROFESSIONS WITH OUR OWN SCOPES OF PRACTICE. AND PROFESSIONAL SETTINGS. OUR PURVIEW THEN IS TO SET ENTRY LEVEL LICENSING STANDARDS INCLUDING INSEMINATION ACQUIREMENT THAT MEASURE THE CANDIDATES PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE AS WELL AS CLINICAL ABILITIES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE DEMANDS AND REQUIREMENTS OF ALL THREE PROFESSIONS. SO THE BOARD BOUNCES IT'SEDUCATION ITS OUTREACH AND ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT OUR POLICIES ARE CURRENT AND THEN- CONSISTENT WITH ACCEPTABLE STANDARDS OF CARE FOR EACH OF THOSE DISCIPLINES. NOW SOME OF YOU KNOW WHAT OUR LICENSEES DO BUT SOME DON'T SO I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY DESCRIBE- EACH AREA. SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGISTS PROVIDE SERVICES IN THE AREAS OF SPEECH LANGUAGE VOICE COGNITION FLUENCY AND SWALLOWING DISORDERS TO INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE LIFESPAN. THEY SEE INDIVIDUALS WHO AS A RESULT OF A STROKE OR BRAIN INJURY OR OTHER NEUROGENIC BECAUSE WE HAVE LANGUAGE DIFFICULTIES THAT INCLUDE BURBLING EXPRESSION AUDITORY COMPREHENSION READING COMPREHENSION AND WRITTEN EXPRESSION THEY ALSO POVIDE THERAPIES FOR INDIVIDUALS ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM. AND PROGRESSIVE NEUROLOGIC DISORDERS AS WELL AS THOSE WHO ARE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING. THEY WORK IN A VARIETY OF SETTINGS INCLUDING SCHOOLS HOSPITALS COMMUNITY BASED. FACILITIES AND IN PRIVATE PRACTICE. I PER SERVICE FOR AN WITH HEARING LOSS AND IS OR BALANCE DISORDERS ACROSS THE LIFESPAN. THEY PROVIDE STANDARD DIAGNOSTIC HEARING TESTING FOR ALL AGES THEY PROVIDE NEWBORN HEARING SCREENINGS THEY FIT HEARING AIDS FOR PATIENTS OF ALL AGES INCLUDING INCENSE- THEY DIAGNOSE TENNIS AND MANAGE IT- THEY PROVIDE ORAL REHABILITATION AND OCCASIONALLY INTRAOPERATIVE NEUROMONITORING. AND THEY ALSO WORK IN A NUMBER OF PROFESSIONAL SETTINGS INCLUDING HOSPITALS. PEDIATRIC CLINICS UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL CLINICS PRIVATE PRACTICE MILITARY FACILITIES AS WELL AS IN OUR INDUSTRY RESEARCH IN FORENSIC SETTINGS. HEARING AID DISPENSERS PROVIDE SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS WITH HEARING LOSS. INCLUDING SELECTING AND FITTING HEARING AIDS AND PROVIDE HEARING TEST FOR THE PURPOSES OF GETTING AND SELLING HEARING AIDS. AND THEY WILL ALSO WORK IN A VARIETY OF SETTINGS INCLUDING HEARING AID CLINICS MEDICAL OFFICES AND RETAIL LOCATIONS. MONITORING THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE IS CRITICAL TO THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT HARM. TO CONSUMERS IN THESE PROFESSIONS I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU JUST A FEW EXAMPLES. EACH LANGUAGE WITH PAGE ARE RISK OF ASPIRIN OF MATERIAL INTO THEIR LUNGS WHEN UNDERGOING EVALUATION THAT REQUIRE THE INTRODUCTION OF MATERIALS INTO THE THROAT. HEARING TESTING AND EVALUATION INVOLVES THE USE OF SOUND AIR PRESSURE AND OTHER PHYSICAL STIMULI. IN THE EAR INTO THE HEAD OF THE AUDIOLOGY PATIENTS ARE AT RISK OF PHYSICAL HARM SUCH AS PUNCTURES ON THE SKIN OF THE EAR THE EAR CANAL AND EARDRUM ITSELF- IF AUDIO LOGICAL OR MIDDLE YOUR MEASUREMENTS ARE PERFORMED INCORRECTLY. SINCE AUDIOLOGIST INSERTED VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS INTO THE EAR CANAL. OUR PATIENTS WITH- OF HEARING AID DISPENSERS COULD SUFFER DAMAGE TO THEIR EARS CENTRAL TUSCANY OR IMPRESSION TAKING IS PERFORMED INCORRECTLY. THE BOARD'S LICENSING POPULATION IS OVER THIRTY FIVE INDIVIDUAL INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES AND THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR- SAYS THAT THE SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY AND AUDIOLOGY PROFESSIONS WILL INCREASE FROM TWENTY THIRTY. AND HISTORICALLY THE RATES OF GROWTH FOR CALIFORNIA BEEN EVEN HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL RATE. SO THAT'S CALIFORNIA'S DEMAND FOR SPEECH AND HEARING SERVICES WILL CONTINUE TO GROW IN THE COMING YEARS DUE TO THE CROSS GROWING NEED IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS. HEARING LOSS DETECTION VIA THE NEWBORN HEARING SCREENING PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA AND DUE TO SIMPLY INCREASING AGING POPULATION WHICH WILL EXPERIENCE HEARING LOSS SUFFER STROKES HAVE COGNITIVE DECLINE AND OTHER DEBILITATING ILLNESSES. THAT THAT WILL AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO SPEAK SWALLOW HEARING COMMUNICATE. SO THIS CONSUMER DEMAND WILL MAKE THE ROLE OF THE BOARD EVEN MORE CRITICAL TO ENSURE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE USE OF THREE PROFESSIONS. SO IN ORDER TO CONTINUE PROTECTING THE CONSUMERS OF SPEECH AND HEARING SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA WE STRONGLY URGE THE COMMITTEE TO RECOMMEND THE CONTINUED REGULATION OF THE PRACTICES OF SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY AUDIOLOGY AND HEARING AID DISPENSERS BY THE BOARD. WE WOULD BE PLEASED TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU DR- MISS KAISER MS BURNS MISTER SANCHEZ ANY FURTHER COMMENTS. NONE OF THIS TIME BUT WE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO BE HERE. THANK YOU LET'S- LET'S TURN THE MATTER OVER TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES IN THE CHAMBER- ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS FIRST A CHAIR BERMAN. THANK YOU- TEAR OFF AND I KNOW OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS HAS BEEN SOME CONVERSATION ABOUT SPEECH LANGUAGE SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY AND AUDIOLOGY AIDS- CAN. YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW PATIENTS HAVE BEEN HARMED BY SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY OR AUDIOLOGY AIDS AND ROUGHLY HOW MANY COMPLAINTS THAT THE BOARD IS RECEIVED. IN REGARD TO SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY OR AUDIOLOGY AIDS AND WIT THE NATURE OF THOSE COMPLAINTS WERE. I CAN SPEAK THE IDEOLOGY PORTION OF THAT- IDEOLOGY AIDS AT THIS POINT ARE PRETTY MUCH ALLOWED TO DO ANYTHING IN AUDIOLOGIST CAN DO UNDER THE SUPERVISION. OF AN AUDIOLOGIST BUT AS I MENTIONED IN THE POTENTIAL HARMS THAT CAN OCCUR- AIDES THAT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO TAKE YOUR IMPRESSIONS WHERE THEY'RE PUTTING UP. A MATERIAL INTO THE EAR CANAL- THEY'RE LOOKING AND THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE- PACKING THE ST- OUR APP OR DOING TYMPANUM ENTRY WHICH IS THE MIDDLE YOUR MEASUREMENT BOTH OF THOSE COULD CAUSE HARM TO THE EAR CANAL. AND TO THE- TO THE EAR DRUM. PUNCHING THE AIR DRUM IS NOT A GOOD THING. SO THOSE THINGS CAN DEFINITELY OCCUR. I HAVE THOSE THINGS OCCURRED DO WE HAVE ANY EXAMPLES OF THOSE THINGS HAPPENING- THAT. DANNY CALIFORNIANS YEAH IN REALITY WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED COMPLAINTS. OF AUDIOLOGY AIDS HARMING- CONSUMERS AT THIS POINT- BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT CAN'T HAPPEN AT ANY TIME OR THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN- BUT WE HAVE WE HAVE TO BE WARY THAT IT COULD ESPECIALLY THESE ARE ON. INEXPERIENCED INDIVIDUALS UNTRAINED UNEDUCATED MEN IN MANY CASES. AND THEY'RE BEING GIVEN A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THESE KINDS OF THINGS ANDERSON THANKS AND CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE BOARD'S RECOMMENDED RENEWAL AND CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS. AND HOW THE BOARD CAME TO THAT RECOMMENDATION. FOR AUDIO AIDS OR IN GENERAL. FOR THE- LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY THE SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY AND AUDIOLOGY IT'S- OKAY- THE RESERVE POLICY WANT TO TAKE THAT QUESTION. YES I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BUT SO BASICALLY THE- SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY AND AUDIOLOGY AID REGISTRATION IS A REGISTRATION OF THE SUPERVISOR'S SUPERVISOR IS TELLING THE BOARD THAT THIS PERSON IS HELPING THEM AND ASSISTING THEM WITH. VARIOUS FUNCTIONS OF THE OFFICE. WITH THE REGISTRATION IS THAT IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THE BOARD TO KEEP TRACK OF THE NUMBER OF AGENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY REGISTERED IN CALIFORNIA WE DON'T HAVE A RENEWAL CYCLE- I'M THERE. D. EIGHT DESIGNATION ALSO RELIES ON TREATY SO INITIALLY THE SUPERVISOR TOLD THE BOARD THE TYPE OF TRAINING THAT'S PROVIDED TO THE BOARD IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSURING THAT THAT TREATING IS ADEQUATE FOR THAT B. AND FOR THE TASKS THAT THEY'RE ASSIGNED TO. IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO DO THIS WITHOUT A RENEWAL- PERIOD AND IT'S ALSO DIFFICULT FOR US TO ENSURE THAT THERE COULD THE NEST TRAINING NOT JUST TO DO THEIR JOB BUT YOU KEEP UP WITH THE CHANGES THAT ARE HAPPENING IN SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY AND AUDIOLOGY. AND IT ACTUALLY COULD COST US MORE JUST TO KEEP THEM REGISTERED AND CONSTANTLY HAVE TO TRACK THEM USE WORKAROUNDS IN OUR SYSTEM SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS THAT THE B. REQUIRED TO JUST RENEW TO KEEP THE BOARD UP TO DATE WITH THE NUMBER OF EIGHT SO WE HAVE AND PROVIDE THEM WITH ADEQUATE TRAINING. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU MR. THANK YOU LET ME JUST ASK- ONE OR TWO QUICK QUESTIONS AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES- I NOTE FROM THE BACKGROUND PAPERS THAT. THE BOARD REPORTS THAT IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERSTAFFED. AND I GUESS MY QUESTION RELATES TO THIS UNDERSTAFFING GIVEN YOUR LICENSE FEE STRUCTURE- WHAT OPTIONS DO YOU HAVE TO SECURE APPROPRIATE STAFFING TO DEAL. WITH A NUMBER OF LICENSEES THAT YOU. HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OVERSEEING. I THINK MISTER SANCHEZ CAN PROBABLY ANSWER THAT BEST. THANK YOU- THE BOARD OF FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS- WAS IN A FISCAL STRUCTURAL BALANCE- MATTER REVENUE THAT WAS COMING IN WAS NOT MATCHING THE EXPENSES THE GROWING. FORWARD SO FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS- THEBOARD HAS BEEN WORKING TO INCREASE ITS THEMES- WE BOTH LOOKED AT ALL OUR DIFFERENT BERRIES AND EFFICIENCY FOR INSTANCE WE HAVE IT HIS LICENSING WORKLOAD AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF A BUSINESS MODERNIZATION. PROGRAM WHICH MANDATES CAN ACTUALLY ALLOW US TO CONDUCT ONLINE LICENSING WE THINK THAT'S GOOD- MINIMIZE OF MUCH OF THE WORK LOAD BUT- WE WERE RECENTLY SUCCESSFUL AND- IN GETTING OUR REGULATIONS PROMULGATED TO RAISE OUR FEES. FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS- WE HAVE- MUCH BETTER FINE CONDITION AND AS YOU KNOW THE BUT PROCESS IT'S A FEW YEARS IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE'VE ACTUALLY INCREASED OUR STAFFING UP BY THIRTY PERCENT. AND THAT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH BUT WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE CAN GROW AND HAVE ADEQUATE STAFFING TO ADDRESS THE WORKLOAD AND A GROWING WORKLOAD THAT WE EXPECT. IN FUTURE. THANK YOU ONE THAT SAME NOTE AND- HI KNOW IT WAS SUMMONED THE STATEMENT IN THE BACK PAPER. THE DC IS ALMOST ENTIRELY FUNDED BY A PORTION OF THE LICENSING FEES PAID BY CALIFORNIA STATE REGULATED PROFESSIONALS IN THE FORM OF PRO RATA AND THAT INCLUDES THE STATE REGULATED PROFESSIONALS IN THE WITH REGARD TO THE BOARD WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. AND THE FURTHER STATEMENT IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER THAT PRO RATED AS A PORTION PRIMARILY BASED ON THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED STAFF AT EACH BOARD RATHER THAN BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF DC ETS SERVICES PROGRAMS- ARE UTILIZED. WHAT OPTION. IN THIS CASE DOES THE BOARD HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE COST PRESSURES. IN IN RAISING. THE C. A. AND OTHER- EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS. THE BORDER DRESSES COST PRESSURES WITHIN ITS CONTROL BY CONTINUOUSLY MONITORING ITS CHARGER AND MAKING NECESSARY REDUCTIONS- THAT. THAT THEY'RE ABLE BUT THE BOARD IS ABLE TO MAKE. AS FAR AS- PRO RATTA- WE ARE PROBABLY AT ABOUT 20% OF OUR BUDGET GOES TO PRO RATTA- AS YOU KNOW WE'RE A SMALLER BOARD- BOARD OF OUR SIZE COULD NOT. SUSTAIN SOME OF THE PERSONNEL BECAUSE SOME OF THE IT COSTS THAT ARE INVOLVED SO WE RELY GREATLY ON THE SUPPORT THAT WE GET FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS NOT ONLY- THROUGH- TRAINING OUR HUMAN RESOURCES WE GET OUR OUR LEGAL SERVICES. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY SOME THAT'S BEE. VERY IMPORTANT LAST FEW YEARS IS C. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT THAT WE GET THAT'S ALLOWING US TO MOVE ON TO A BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PLATFORM TO BETTER SERVE OUR. OUR CONSUMERS AND LICENSEES. WITH YOU FOR FIRST. COLLEAGUES FIRST SENATOR HAND I DON'T REMEMBER WHO WAS FIRST BUT WE'LL CALL YOU SENATOR PAN RIGHT THANK YOU- THANK YOU TERRA- ACTUALLY THIRD FOLLOWING UP ON THE CHAIRS QUESTION- CAN- HE ASKED ABOUT THE DCA A PRO RATTA- AND OF COURSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ALSO YOU BEING UNDERSTAFFED AND- NEEDING FUNDS IN YOUR RECRUITING MORE STAFF- WHAT KIND OF PRESSURES ARE YOU. IS THIS YOUR BOARD EXPERIENCING FROM THE- FEES INCREASED FEES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE- SO WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM MANY BOARDS BUT I DON'T KNOW FOR YOUR PARTICULAR BOARD- THE FEES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAVE COMPOSED OF ACTUALLY RAISED- IS THAT IMPACTING YOUR BUDGET AND YOUR YOU KNOW THE RESOURCES. THAT YOU NEED TO FUNCTION AND HOW ARE YOU TRYING TO AND HOW HAVE SUCCESSFULLY BEEN IN MANAGING THOSE LEGAL COSTS THAT THE DOJ IS. NOW HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED. THE USER PANEL M. ANSWER THAT QUESTION BUT YOU DO- THE- V. EIGHT G- READINGS- DID IT CATCH US- SOMEWHAT BY SURPRISE IN THE INCREASES FOR US WERE ABOUT 20% OVER THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS- WE DON'T HAVE. THE LARGER- DISCIPLINARY WORK LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER BOARDS HAVE SO I CAN I CAN I THINK IT AFFECTS EVERYONE DIFFERENTLY FOR US- WE HAVE THE OPTION TO. REQUEST A AG BUDGET AUGMENTATION IN THE MIDDLE HERE THAT'S ACTUALLY. A FEATURE THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN AVAILABLE TO US. BECAUSE IT ANY CASE- KITTEN CAN COST YOU MORE MONEY YOU CAN HAVE. TWENTY CASES IN YOUR IN ONE CASE CAN CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE WORK FOR INSTANCE WE HAD A CASE WHERE A RESPONDENT LICENSEE I THOUGHT EVERY APPEAL- AVAILABLE TO HIM AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR- SMALLER AG BUDGET. SO WE DO HAVE THAT ABILITY TO GET A BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS KNOWN HERE THAT ALSO ALLOWS THE BOARD TO PROVIDE CONTINUOUS CONSUMER PROTECTION. ACT OKAY I JUST CUT BY THE THAT- BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS THAT BORN WHO BEARS THAT COST THE BUDGET AUGMENTATION THE LICENSEES. OR IS IT COMING FROM THE STATE. THAT WOULD BE OUT OF THE BOARD'S FUND. OKAY SO SET ASIDE I JUST YOU KNOW MAKE WHERE AGAIN IT'S THE LICENEES- SO CERTAINLY YES YOU'RE DOING YOUR DUTY AND YOU NEED TO DO THAT. THESE INCREASES IN THE OJ FEES THEN EVENTUALLY TRANSLATES INTO. HIGHER BURDENS FOR LICENSEES WHICH OF COURSE ALREADY HAVING TO HAVE THE INCREASES IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE L. D. C. A. PEREIRA AND THE INCREASED STAFF THAT YOU DO NEED IT WHICH OF WHICH IS CERTAINLY. LEARN ABOUT THAT- THE OTHER QUICK QUESTION I HAVE ON C. E. N. O. WAS ASKED ABOUT THE AIDS BUT- OVERALL AND YOU CONTINUE TO CATION THAT ISSUE NUMBER TEN. BUT THINGS I'D MAKE NOTE IS THAT- YOU KNOW TWENTY EIGHTEEN NOT IT'S YOU KNOW PRE COATED. SURE THERE'S ONLY SO THERE'S ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT COMPLETE PERCENT COMPLIANCE SO THAT MEANT THE PROXY 22% OF LICENSEES WERE COMPLIANT WITH THE C. E. REQUIREMENTS- AND YOU'RE SIMPLY ABOUT 5% RANDOM AUDITS BUT IF THAT'S THE SAMPLE YOU STILL GETTING TWENTY TWO PERCENT. I CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHAT THE- BOARD IS DOING TO ASSURE THAT LICENSEES ARE ACTUALLY MAINTAINING THE COMPETENCE. AND THE KEEPING UP WITH THEIR C. E. THE CONTINUING EDUCATION THANK YOU. YES SANCHEZ MISPRINTS YOU WANNA ARBOR DRESS THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO DO YEAH TO TALK ABOUT THE- I'M I'M GETTING A NEW MESSAGE ON MY SCREEN SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE YOU CAN HEAR ME. WE CAN HEAR YOU CAN HEAR YOU OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU YES THE NUMBERS THAT WE REPORTED ON OUR LAST LICENSING AUDIT WERE ACTUAL NUMBERS SO. WE DID AN INITIAL AUDIT AND- THAT INITIALIZE SHOWED THAT APPROXIMATELY 20% OF THOSE AUDITED WERE OUT OF COMPLIANCE- WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. COMPLIANCE SO NOW BUT I HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY. OKAY MAY I CLARIFY IS THAT YES YOU NOW YOU FIRST IDENTIFY 20% AND OF THE PEOPLE YOU IDENTIFIED. OF COURSE AND THEY RESPONDED BUT THE YOU KNOW YOUR TEST YOUR YOUR SAMPLING 5% SO THAT MEANS THE OTHER 95% HOW DO GOOD IT ARE THEY RESPONDING I GUESS THAT YOU KNOW THEY'VE BEEN CITED YET SO ARE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN IDENTIFIED SO HE CLEARLY DOES A BASELINE PROBLEM WHEN YOU DO YOUR SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS. YEAH THAT'S A SAMPLE OF- YOUR YOUR TOTAL POPULATION SO THAT MEANS. THE INDEXER CONCERNING THAT SO HIGH IN YOUR SAMPLE. YES YES YES YES SIR BUT IF I COULD SWIM WE HAVE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT ISSUES WHAT IS OKAY WE NEED ADDITIONAL STAFFING TO CONDUCT THE C. ARTS. CURRENTLY WHEN YOU CONDUCT A C. ON IT OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW 5% IS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF YOUR ENTIRE POPULATION THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND. BUT WE ARE LOOKING TO YOU KNOW AS PART OF BUILDING OUR FISCAL STRUCTURE AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH REVENUE TO CHOOSE- ADDRESS WORKLOAD WE ARE LOOKING TO. AUGMENT OUR STAFFING SO THAT WE COULD PROVIDE SHE AUDITS AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WAYS THAT EVERYONE IN THE LIFE CYCLE OF DEVICES WOULD IT SIMPLY BE AUDITED. BUT I DID WANT TO POINT OUT THAT. THE REASON THAT SOME OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WERE OUT OF COMPLIANCE IT VARIES AND I THINK IT HAD A LOT TO DO WITH. THE WAY THAT OUR REGULATIONS ARE WRITTEN THEY CAN BE SOMEWHAT CONFUSING FOR INSTANCE MANY AUDIOLOGISTS AND SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGIST OR TO A LICENSE HOLDERS. AND SOME AUDIOLOGIST- HOLD A LICENSE THAT REQUIRES RENEWAL EVERY YEAR SO THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION WHEN I ACTUALLY SPOKE TO THESE- THESE INDIVIDUALS SOME OF THEM COMPLETED THEIR OR- THEIR C. E. BUT THEY DIDN'T DO IT WITHIN THE- RENEWAL PERIOD. BUT INSTEAD DID IT WITHIN THE CALENDAR YEAR WHAT ARE SOME OF THEM GOT THEIR CD FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. THINKING THAT IT WAS THAT MANY OF OUR LICENSEES WORK IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SOME OF THEM THOUGHT THAT THEIR CD WAS ACTUALLY APPROVED CD ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT IT WASN'T. OR THEY TOOK SELF STUDY AND EXCEEDED THE AMOUNT OF SELF STUDY. SO A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE TALKED TO ACTUALLY JUST BLEW IT OFF AND ON AND I THINK- THE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WERE WERE CITED. OKAY AND GIVEN. I APPRECIATE THAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S SOME WORK TO DO TO PERHAPS CLARIFY THE REGULATIONS AND EDUCATE THE LICENSEES SO THAT- THEY CAN BE IN COMPLIANCE RIGHT. OKAY AND THEN ACTUALLY JUST THE ISSUE NUMBER ELEVEN THAT'S IT THE- MAY NOTE THAT- YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE EXPLICIT AUTHORIZATION TO DISCIPLINE LICENSEES WHO HAVE KICKBACKS. IS THAT SOMETHING WE NEED TO ACT ON. HERE THOUGH AS THE LEGISLATURE. WELL IT IS IT IS THAT. UNKNOWN HOW MANY LICENSE MAY INVITE. OF THIS PROVISION. WE CURRENTLY HAVE ABOUT TWENTY SIX PENDING INVESTIGATIONS OF ALLEGED UNLAWFUL REFERRALS- WHICH AS YOU MENTIONED THE BOARD CANNOT COMMENT ON IT- AS YOU KNOW. THE BOARD CAN'T COMMENT ON THIS TIME BUT THE BOARD'S JURISDICTION IS LIMITED TO THE CONDUCT OF ITS LICENSEES- IF. IF THERE'S A WAY FOR THIS BODY TO HELP US. DEAL WITH THIS I'M SURE WILL BE APPRECIATED I DON'T KNOW IF IT. ANSWERS WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THAT FURTHER. YES AND I APPRECIATE THIS QUESTION BECAUSE THIS IS AN AREA THAT- JUST NEED CLARIFICATION FOR INSTANCE THE BOARD AS A PRIMARY FOR SIR OF BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE SECTION SIX FIFTY. WHICH ADDRESSES THESE- ILLEGAL OR INAPPROPRIATE REFERRALS. IN OUR STATUTES IT LISTS THAT PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT IT IS A CONVICTION OF BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE SIX FIFTY SO IN TALKING TO OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL PARTNERS IN ON THIS ISSUE THEY MADE A POINT THAT WE SHOULD SEE UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT A VIOLATION AT SIX FIFTY AND NOT LIMITED TO A CRIMINAL CONVICTION ALL RIGHT THANK YOU I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR PANCER LATER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY AND AUDIOLOGIST- I GOT MY DEGREE A VERY LONG TIME AGO IN COMMUNICATIVE DISORDERS AND I JUST REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO FOR FOLKS YOUR PROFESSION IS CHANGING LIVES EVERY DAY- BUT TALKING ABOUT ME GETTING MY DEGREE I EVER HAD A LONG TIME AGO I'M JUST WONDERING IF THE AUDIOLOGY LICENSING REQUIREMENTS SHOULD BE UPDATED TO REFLECT CURRENT EDUCATIONAL AND PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE STANDARDS. THANK YOU SIR LABOR. TEAM BAYLISS. I'M HAVING TO RESPOND TO THAT- THANK YOU THERE IS A NEED TO UPDATE THE STANDARDS IN THAT- THEY'RE VERY OLD AND THEY WERE BASED ON THE AT A TIME WHEN WE HAD A MASTER'S DEGREE AS THE ENTRY LEVEL DEGREE FOR LICENSURE FRIDAY LG BUT NOW IT IS A CLINICAL DOCTORATE AND THAT MEANS THAT OUR NUMBER OF CLINICAL OUR REQUIREMENTS ARE ARE VERY LOW THERE THREE FIFTY WHEN MOST PROGRAMS AG PROGRAMS NOW- ARE REQUIRING AT LEAST EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHTEEN HUNDRED FIFTY HOURS. ALSO WE HAVE A RADIO AT WE HAVE IN OUR REGULATIONS AND OUR STATUTE THAT- THAT STUDENTS HAVE TO EARN THE TWELVE MONTHS OF REQUIRE PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE POST DIDACTIC SO ONCE THEY COMPLETE OTHER COURSE WORK AND THEY HAVE TO DO THIS THAT'S CAUSING AT ALL OF OUR WORK WITHIN THE LAST YEAR WITH THE VARIOUS CD PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE HAS SHOWN US THAT THAT'S CAUSING A BIG PROBLEM FOR STUDENTS EITHER THOSE WHO COME FROM OUT OF THE COUNTRY WHO HAVE ELEVEN MONTHS VISAS WHO CAN'T COMPLETE THIS. SOME STUDENTS ARE FINISHING WAY BEFORE IN TERMS OF COMPLETING THEIR HOURS AND HAVE TO CONTINUE IN THE PROGRAM PAYING TUITION NOT WORKING AND SO ON SO WE'RE DEFINITELY WORKING ON BOTH THE- REGULATORY AND STATUTORY CHANGES TO TRY TO MAKE THAT MORE TENABLE GET PEOPLE OUT AND. AND- WORKING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. VERY GOOD IF THERE'S A WE CAN DO TO HELP WITH THAT BECAUSE WE DO KNOW THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF PAUL THOUGHT LANGUAGE PATHOLOGISTS AND- AUDIOLOGISTS. PLEASE LET US KNOW. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK COLLIE AND- A KAISER TO SPEAK TO THE SPEECH PATHOLOGY A SITUATION. MA'AM YOU'RE ON MUTE. I DO IT ALL THE TIME OKAY I THOUGHT IT WAS A NICHE- DOCTOR ROGER DO YOU WANT ME TO SPEAK TO IT THAT SHORTAGES I WENT I WOULD YOU KNOW WHAT AND WHAT WHAT KINDS OF INTERVENTIONS HAVE HAVE BEEN DONE OR WILL BE DONE TO TRY TO- SOLVE THAT OKAY. WITH THE SHORTAGE OF SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGISTS IT'S DEFINITELY THOUGHT NATIONALLY AND EVEN MORE SO AND- WESTERN STATES AND- AT AT THIS SPEECH PATHOLOGIST- IN BOTH SCHOOLS AND HEALTH CARE SETTINGS REPORT AT THEIR JOB OPENINGS ALWAYS EXCEED THE NUMBER OF JOB SEEKERS- KNOWING THAT THIS IS DUE TO IT TWO DIFFERENT MAINLY TO DIFFERENT FACTORS- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT I'M PART OF IT IS THAT A LIMITED NUMBER OF GRADUATE SCHOOL OPENINGS. AND THE OTHER ASPECT IS INCREASED NEED FOR SERVICES AND AS MENTIONED WE PROVIDE SERVICES ACROSS THE AGE SPAN SO YOU HAVE GROWTH IN THE AREA OF- CHILDREN BEING SEEN IN DIAGNOSED AT YOUNGER AGES SO WE HAVE A LOT OF EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES- INCREASES AND ARTISAN WHICH WERE. AWARE OF EACH AND THEN INCREASES IN OUR AGING POPULATION WITH DEMENTIA STROKES- SWALLOWING DISORDERS- AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE IN CALIFORNIA- WE HAVE A LOT OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND THAT WITH THE NEED FOR BILINGUAL SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGISTS FAR ACTS OUT AT EXCEEDS ON ANY WE CAN SUPPLY- END IN ADDITION OUR ROLE IN SCHOOLS WHERE THE MAJORITY OF OUR SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGISTS WORK- ART OUR- OUR SCOPE OF PRACTICE HAS EXPANDED OVER THE YEARS WE'RE NOT. JUST PULLING KIDS OUT INTO A CLINICAL ROOM WE'RE WORKING IN THE CLASSROOMS WERE SUPPORTING TEAMS THAT ARE WORKING WITH KIDS- EVEN INCH- GENERAL EDUCATION- SO. AS OUR EYES ARE WORKING. THE ANSWER IS ARE WE CLOSING ARE STRETCHED THEN- I KNOW INTO OF END A QUESTION ABOUT- HOW WE'RE SOLVING IS. I IT'S A KIND OF DANCE OF COURSE- ONE THING I PERSONALLY INVOLVED WITH IS LOOKING AT AT AT ELIGIBILITY- IN CASE LOAD WORKLOAD ISSUES TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE ARE WORKING AT THE TOP OF OUR FIELD MAKING SURE THAT AGAIN WE'RE NOT JUST. PULLING KIDS IN FOR DIRECT TREATMENT ALL THE TIME THAT THE MORE PEOPLE WILL BE IMPACTED THROUGH- TEAM TRAININGS USING SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY ASSISTANTS EFFICIENTLY ALL OF THOSE WAYS ARE GOING TO HELP US- BE MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE IN OUR SERVICES. AT THE SAME TIME I KNOW THAT UNIVERSITIES ARE WORKING VERY HARD ON- TRYING TO INCREASE. IT TO INCREASE THE PROGRAMS. I'D LIKE TO ALSO ADD THAT LAST YEAR THE- CHANCELLOR OF THE CALIFORNIA- STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM DID GET. A THREE MILLION DOLLAR GRANT TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AND SPEECH PATHOLOGY MASTER'S PROGRAMS TO TRY TO INCREASE OUR THE ENROLLMENT. AND SO IN OUR PARTICULAR PROGRAM WHERE I AM HONORED TEACH- WE WERE ABLE TO GO FROM THIRTY TWO GRADUATE STUDENTS TO FIFTY- SPEECH PATHOLOGY GRADUATE STUDENTS BUT ONCE THOSE FUNDS ARE. ARE AND- YEAH COMPLETE ERROR ARE USED AS THEN WE'RE BACK TO OUR THIRTY TWO THIS YEAR FOR EXAMPLE. THE OTHER ISSUE FOR AG PROGRAMS IS THAT. THEY THEY ONLY TAKE IN ABOUT TEN TO TWELVE EIGHTY STUDENTS PER COHORT. BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE MODEL WORKS IS ONCE YOU COMPLETE DIDACTIC SEAT THEN YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND DO KIND OF LIKE A RESIDENCY. AND THAT REQUIRES PLACEMENTS IN PUBLIC FACILITIES HOSPITALS CLINICS AND SO ON. AND THOSE ARE LIMITED AND WHERE WE CAN PLACE THEM SO WE CAN'T BE TAKING IN COHORTS OF FORTY STUDENTS EVEN THOUGH THERE IS THAT KIND OF INTEREST OUT THERE- THERE'S JUST NO WHERE TO PLACE THEM LATER AND THAT'S TRUE FOR SPEECH PATHOLOGY AS WELL. SO WE'RE LIMITED IN HOW MANY WE CAN TAKE- SO STUDENTS WORK ARE CREATIVE AND THEY END UP AND GOING TO OTHER STATES IF NECESSARY OR TAKING LONGER OR WHATEVER THEY HAVE TO DO- NOW THIS MAY SOUND COUNTERINTUITIVE BUT- WE HAVE WE USED TO HAVE NINE MASTER'S PROGRAMS AND IDEOLOGY IN THE STATE. AND NOW WE HAVE FIVE C. AS YOU PROGRAMS AND ONE PRIVATE AND ONE YOU SEE A RELATED PROGRAMS- WE COULD USE MORE PROGRAMS. ED SO THAT WE CAN BE GRADUATING A FEW MORE PEOPLE EVEN IF THEY HAVE TO GO TO NEVADA OR OHIO TO GET THERE AND THEIR CLINICAL HOURS. I'LL DO THAT AND THEN I'LL COME. BACK TO CALIFORNIA TO SERVICE PUBLIC. WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE NUMBER WE NEED TO CAN. TO SURE THE THIS ISSUES HAVE THE FUNDING FOR THIS- BUT NUMBER TWO MY QUESTION IS ABOUT. DOING THERE THE TIME LIKE AN INTERNSHIP OR WHATNOT. CAN IT NOT BE DONE AT OUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS ARE HIGH SCHOOLS. OR DOES IT HAVE TO BE DONE I DID MINE IN AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SO WE HAVE LOTS OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND HIGH SCHOOLS UP AND DOWN THE STATE BUT IT IS- MAY THERE BE A NEW REQUIREMENT NOW. KNOW WHAT I THINK OF LIKE LITTLE- AND THIS CASE OR SPEAK TO THAT BUT I THINK I THINK THOSE ARE CERTAINLY BIBLE INFUSED OPTIONS AT THIS TIME. YES- THE THERE ARE PLENTY OF PLACES AS YOU SAID- ACROSS ALL THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. Q. YOU SHOULD DO YOUR REQUIRED PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE HERE YOUR INTERNSHIP HERE- HOWEVER I HAVE SUPERVISION MUST BE PROVIDED EIGHT HOURS A MONTH FOR ANYBODY IN THAT DURING THAT YEAR SO THAT'S ONE CONSIDERATION. THE OTHER THING IS FOR THOSE THAT ARE- WANTING O- WORK IN THE MEDICAL FIELD. IT CAN BE MUCH MUCH HARDER TO FIND- INTERNSHIPS BECAUSE THEY- AND MEDICAL STAFF GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE. THE CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO SUPERVISE AS READILY AS A SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE- IN ONE. WAY THAT A LOT OF- INTERNS DEAL WITH THIS IS THEY DO THEIR INTERNSHIPS IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND LATER ON TO SWITCH OVER TO MEDICAL- IN THEIR PRACTICE BUT IDEALLY THAT IS NOT WORKING WITH- CHEESE. GOT IT THANK YOU LADIES VERY MUCH KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU CENTER LEVEL OF SPIRITUAL LET ME JUST- BEFORE YOU START LET ME JUST ASK A COUPLE FOLLOW UP MAY I. THANK YOU SIR- WHAT IS THE DELTA IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF JOBS THAT REMAIN UNFILLED. AND THE NUMBER OF SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY. THE PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF THESE TRAINING PROGRAMS. MAYBE I MISSED IT DO YOU HAVE THAT NUMBER. WELL WE KNOW WHAT THE GROWTH RATE WILL BE BUT WHAT WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE DO IT TRACTION AND OTHER ISSUES- EXACTLY HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE- GRADUATING AND THE NEW EIGHTY PROGRAMS AT LEAST FOR AUDIOLOGY- YOU MAY KNOW THAT THAT SET A NEW PROGRAM STARTED IN CALIFORNIA IN THE CSU ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO. SO ONLY THE FIRST COHORT IS BEING GRADUATED FROM CAL STATE LA NOW AND THIS SUMMER WILL GRADUATE THE FIRST COHORT- BUT THE NEED IS GOING TO GROW SIGNIFICANTLY FOR BOTH PROFESSIONS AND I JUST FEEL LIKE NATIONWIDE THE SHORTAGE IS VERY OBVIOUS- THERE ARE MANY PAPERS OUT THERE THAT THAT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SUPPLY YOU WITH THOSE REFERENCES. AND SHOW WHAT THE EXPECTED SHORTAGES ARE GOING TO BE BUT WE DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBERS OF WHAT THE COURT SIZE WILL BE ACROSS THE STATE AND TELL ALL ALL PROGRAMS START PUTTING OUT THERE THERE ARE TEN TO TWELVE GRADUATES EACH YEAR WHAT WE HAVE MAYBE FIFTY TO SIXTY DO AUDIOLOGISTS AND THAT HASN'T HAPPENED. I KNOW THAT SOUNDS A STATE FOR EXAMPLE ONLY TOOK IN SIX LAST YEAR- FOR VARIOUS REASONS- SO WE CAN ALWAYS COUNT THE COHORT PLAN. ANYWAY THAT'S THAT'S HOW I LOOK AT IT AND THAT'S FOR AUDIOLOGY I ASSUME YES IN THE END THE TERMINAL DEGREE FOR AUDIOLOGIST AS IT IS A DOCTORAL DEGREE IT'S A CLINICAL DOCTORAL TRAINING AND DOCTORAL DEGREE AND FOR SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY IS MORE APPARENT FROM THE PRIOR TESTIMONY TO. THE PROFESSIONAL DEGREE OUTSIDE OF. TEACHING IS A MASTER'S DEGREE. YEAH I AM WELL IT IT IS A- YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE A TEACHING. CREDENTIAL IN SCHOOLS YOU CAN WORK WITH THE CREDENTIALS OR A LICENSE. AND THE REASON AND THE REASON I ASK MY QUESTION ABOUT THE DELTA. MEMBERS I THINK YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE WERE MORE JOBS THAN THERE WERE PEOPLE TO FILL THEM. AND I DIDN'T KNOW IF THAT NUMBER HAD BEEN QUANTIFIED. I HAVE INFORMATION FROM SURVEYS FROM THE AMERICAN SPEECH LANGUAGE HEARING ASSOCIATION- DID YOU. SURVEYS ARE OF THOSE IN HEALTHCARE AND THOSE IN A SCHOOL BASED AND- I'M SURE WE CAN GIVEN MORE TIME TO GET MORE PRECISE INFORMATION BUT- IN SO. ONE OF THE MORE RECENT. REPORTS IS IT'S NOT- IN ITS TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MORE THAN- WELL 64% TO MORE THAN HALF OF SCHOOL BASED SLP A SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGIST- REPORTED THAT THEIR- SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ARE. SEEKING SPEECH LANGUAGE. PATHOLOGIST AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN- THE HEALTH CARES SURVEY SHOWED THAT- THOSE RESPONDED 27% OF THEM. SAID THEY WERE FUNDED UNSEALED- POSITIONS IN THEIR SETTINGS BUT WITH RESPECT TO THE PIPELINE I ASSUME. THE PURPOSE THE PIPELINE STARTS AT THE TRAINING PROGRAMS WHICH I ASSUME ARE LARGELY THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY PROGRAMS IS THAT CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT TEN IN TERMS OF CAPACITY IN THE PROGRAMS IS THIS SITUATION SIMILAR TO- FOR EXAMPLE NURSING TRAINING PROGRAMS WHERE THE LIMITING FACTOR TENDS TO BE ONE THE AVAILABILITY OF PHD FACULTY TO TEACH AND TO THE AVAILABILITY OF CLINICAL TRAINING SLOTS. I SAID IT'S MORE THE LATTER- WE'RE NOT REALLY HAVING DIFFICULTY FINDING FACULTY- BUT IT'S THE BEING ABLE TO PLACE PEOPLE FOR THEIR EXTERNSHIP- A CLINICAL EXPERIENCES IS THE BOTTLENECK. ESPECIALLY MEDICAL FACILITIES. OKAY CIRCLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEARCH LOADING YEAH THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND- THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION EXTREMELY% INFORMATIVE- IDEA BOARD OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS DURING THE PANDEMIC ADOPTED A NEW STRATEGIC PLAN- ADDRESS SCENE- IMPROVING SERVICES TO THE CONSUMERS LICENSING- INCREASING OUTREACH TO THE STAKEHOLDERS AND OF COURSE- ENFORCEMENT OF SOME OF THE PROGRAMS CAN YOU HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE POSITIVES THAT- YOU ACCOMPLISHED AND STILL SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU SAY. THAT YOU FACE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS- I GUESS MORE THAN WORKERS COULD SPEAK TO THAT ISSUE BUT- MR SANCHEZ WOULD YOU TALK ABOUT OUR OUR MODERNIZATION OUR BUSINESS MODERNIZATION AND- PLANS AND EFFORTS AT THIS TIME. YES- OBVIOUSLY- THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC CHANGED ALL OF OUR LIVES AND THE WAY THAT WE DO THINGS- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EVEN THOUGH IT CAUGHT US BY SURPRISE I'M FORTUNATE TO HAVE. REALLY GREAT STAFF AND GREAT LEVEL OF SUPPORT AT DCA WITH PROGRESSIVE TECHNOLOGY SIDE BUT EARLY ON WHAT WE DID WAS- MY ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE OFFICER- MISS BURNS AND I. CAME UP WITH A COMMUNICATION PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TALKING TO STAKEHOLDERS LICENSEE. LICENSEES THE WORK SITES TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE THAT WE UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE NEEDS WERE OUT THERE TO SERVE THE CRITICAL NEEDS OF THE CHILDREN THAT MEET SOME OF THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE- WE SERVE IN ELDERLY POPULATION SURVIVING CHILDREN IN SCHOOLS THAT'S A LARGE. A PERCENTAGE AND THEN- ELDERLY PEOPLE SO AT SOME POINT IN EVERYONE'S LIFE SPAN YOU'RE GOING TO YOU'RE GOING TO WORK WITH A SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGIST AND AUDIOLOGIST OR HEARING AID DISPENSER IT'S VERY LIGHT AND SO WE MADE SURE THAT WE WERE COMMUNICATING WITH ALL THESE- POINTS THAT- THERE MIGHT BE PRESSURE. AND ADD A PLAN TO ADDRESS WHATEVER NEEDS THEY WERE- WE WORK WITH DC EIGHTY GET WAIVERS PAST WAIVERS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO KEEP TO CONTINUE SERVICES. AND MOBILIZE OUR OWN STAFF WE HAVE A- A PAPER BASED SYSTEM SO WE HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON HAD ACCESS TO WORK FROM HOME. JUST LIKE THE WORK IN THE OFFICE ON THE OTHER REAL IMPORTANT THING THAT WE DID IS WE CONDUCTED STATEWIDE EXAM OF HEARING AIDS SPENCER'S. IT'S A PRACTICAL HANDS ON EXAM TYPICALLY DONE IN PERSON. MA'AM WE ACTUALLY SECURED A SITE. TO BRING THEM OVER TO ACTUALLY OUR FACILITIES AND- UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF MISS BURNS WE MADE SURE THAT EVERYTHING MET COPE WITH STANDARDS. THAT THAT EVERYTHING WAS SANITIZED AND SAFE AND ARE QUITE AN OPERATION KEEP IN SOCIAL DISTANCING OR BEING ABLE TO CONDUCT THESE. VERY IMPORTANT EXAMINATIONS. THANK YOU MR. THANK YOU SEARCH FOR THE CENTER ADMIN THANK YOU. MR CHAIR AND I WAS JUST IT WAS MORE OF AN OBSERVATION BACK TO THE TO THE LAST POINT I THINK WHEN WE CONTINUE TO DO THE SUNSET REVIEWS I THINK WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO SEE THE SAME ISSUE WELL WE HAVE REALLY ENCOURAGED INCREASED ENROLLMENT AND R. C. ISSUES OFTEN TIMES IT HAS RESULTED. IN THE DETERIORATION OF MASTER'S PROGRAMS AND THE PROLIFERATION OF MASTER'S PROGRAMS- SO I KNOW IT SOCIAL WORKERS NURSES AUDIOLOGISTS ALL OF MASTER'S PROGRAMS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE. AND SO I THINK WHEN WE GO BACK INTO THE PROCESS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LOOK AT AT NOT JUST INCREASING ENROLLMENT BUT SPECIFICALLY FOR DEPARTMENTS AND BECAUSE IT'S A WE'RE WE'RE CHASING OUR TAILS IS NOT ENOUGH TO PROVIDE THE CLINICAL SUPERVISION AND YET WE'RE NOT PRODUCING ENOUGH SO.

LET'S NOT FORGET A REVIEW OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR INTERIOR DESIGN CERTIFICATION LET'S WELCOME GEORGE BRAZIL BOARD CHAIR AND ROSE SUIVI. IF I PRONOUNCE THAT CORRECTLY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU- I WANT TO START BY SAYING THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN THE LEGISLATIVE STAFF FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE TODAY MY NAME IS GEORGE BRAZIL AND THE CURRENT CHAIR FOR CCC IDC I'M A PAST PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA NORTH CHAPTER OBVIOUSLY THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF INTERIOR DESIGNERS- I AM THE CO OWNER OF SUBSCRIBERS ALL DESIGN HERE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND I'VE BEEN PRACTICING INTERIOR DESIGNERS FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE PAST. THIRTY YEARS- I WANTED TO START OFF WITH A BRIEF HISTORY OF CC IDC ON JANUARY FIRST NINETEEN NINETY ONE CHAPTER THREE POINT NINE SECTION FIFTY FIVE EIGHT ZERO ZERO THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE WAS CREATED BY SENATE BILL ONE FIVE THREE AUTHORED BY SENATOR CRAVE AND COULDN'T FIND A TITLE ACT FOR CERTIFIED INTERIOR DESIGNERS. THE STATUTE LAID OUT THE EDUCATION AND WORK EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS ALONG WITH THE YET TO BE DETERMINED EXAMINATION FORINDIVIDUALS TO BECOME A CERTIFIED INTERIOR DESIGNERS AND THE DEFINITION OF AN INTERIOR DESIGN ORGANIZATION TO PROVIDE ADMINISTRATION OF THE TITLE ACT PER SENATOR CRAVENS LETTER DATED DECEMBER NINETEEN NINETY ONE THE INTENT OF THE FOURTH FOR THE TITLE LACKED WAS A MEANS BY WHICH THE PUBLIC AND LOCAL BUILDING OFFICIALS COULD EASILY IDENTIFY. COMPETENT PROFESSIONALS TO WORK WITH BUILDING LIFE SAFETY FLAMMABILITY AND DISABLED ACCESS CODES ISSUES. FOR INTERIOR SPACES. BUT UPON THIS ENTERED FOR AND- DEVELOPED IN CREATED A NONPROFIT BOARD THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR INTERIOR DESIGN CERT CERT. MODELED AFTER STATE BOARDS TO OVERSEE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THIS TITLE ACT AS REQUIRED BY THE- LEGISLATURE. THE BOARD IS CHARGED WITH VERIFYING EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE WHO APPLIED TO BECOME CERTIFIED IN CHAIR DESIGNERS DETERMINING AND APPROVING A SUITABLE AND APPROPRIATE CALIFORNIA EXAMINATION AND MAINTAIN A DATABASE OF THOSE WHO BECOME CERTIFIED. AS OF SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE CC IDC HAS CERTIFIED. FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR INDIVIDUALS SINCENINETEEN NINETY ONE OF WHICH TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE ARE STILL ACTIVE MOSTLY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OUR MISSION IS TO ESTABLISH AND IMPLEMENT PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS AND EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS. EDUCATE THE PUBLIC AND FACILITATE INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSIONALS COMPLIANCE WITH OUR STANDARDS AND CODE OF. ETHICS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FOR THE PROTECTION HEALTH LIFE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THE PUBLIC BY ADMINISTERING THE CERTIFIED INTERIOR DESIGNERS TITLE ACT. AS PART OF OUR BOARD'S MISSION WE ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO BECOME CERTIFIED INTERIOR DESIGNERS MEET THE STATUTORY STANDARDS OF COMPETENCY BY WAY OF EDUCATION EXPERIENCE AND EXAMINATION WE ESTABLISH THE MEASURES THE MEASUREMENT STANDARDS OF COMPETENCY FOR EXPERIENCE AND EXAMINATION FOR THOSE WHO BECOME CERTIFIED INTERIOR DESIGNERS. WE EMPOWER CONSUMERS BY PROVIDING INFORMATION AND EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS TO HELP THEM MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS WHEN HIRING AN INTERIOR DESIGN. INTERIOR DESIGNER CERTIFIED OR OTHERWISE AND WE EMPOWER INTERIOR DESIGNERS BY PROVIDING INFORMATION ON HOW TO BECOME CERTIFIED INTERIOR DESIGNERS IN CALIFORNIA IN ACCORDANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE TITLE LAP. AND FINALLY PROVIDING FORMS AND PRESENTATIONS TO INTERIOR DESIGN SCHOOL PROGRAMS STUDENTS AND INTERIOR DESIGNERS IN GENERAL ON THE REQUIREMENTS AND BENEFITS OF BECOMING A CERTIFIED INTERIOR DESIGNER. SOME OF THE CHANNEL. M. TWO CERTIFICATION- THE LARGEST BARRIER TO CERTIFICATION AND OR THE INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSION AS A WHOLE IS THE ISSUE OF INTERIOR DESIGNERS BEING ABLE TO SUBMIT NONSTRUCTURAL NON SEISMIC INTERIOR DESIGN PLANS TO LOCAL BUILDING DEPARTMENTS FOR PERMIT APPROVAL AN ACQUISITION. A PROCESS BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING DENIED ACCESS TO THE PERMIT PROCESS WITHOUT AN ARCHITECT OR AN- OR AN ENGINEER STAMP. BUILDING APARTMENTS IN LOS-ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO SAN JOSE AND SACRAMENTO REGULARLY DENY INTERIOR DESIGNERS THE ABILITY TO SUBMIT NONSTRUCTURAL NON SEISMIC INTERIOR DESIGN PLANS FOR PERMIT APPROVAL AND ACQUISITION FOR PURPOSES. RECENT PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE LOS ANGELES FAST TRACK PROCESS FOR HIM IT PROHIBITS ANYONE FROM SUBMITTING PLANS THAT DO NOT HAVE AN ARCHITECTS OR OR- ENGINEER STAND. EASILY WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO SUBMIT PLANS FOR THE LAW BUILDING PROFESSIONAL CODE. FIVE FIVE THREE SEVEN FIVE FIVE THREE EIGHT AND FIVE EIGHT OH FIVE BUILDING DEPARTMENTS ARE CREATING BARRIERS TO CERTIFICATION AND THE INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSION IN. CALIFORNIA THESE BERRIES UP THESE BARRIERS ARE CONSIDERED PREJUDICE IN NATURE AND INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSION IN CALIFORNIA IS LARGELY COMPRISED OF WOMEN AND MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY AND- MINORITIES. ACCORDING ACCORDING TO DATA USA DOT COM NCARB W. DOT COM IN THE U. S. BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS. SEVENTY SIX POINT 3% OF INTERNET SIGNERS ARE WOMEN COMPARED TO NINETEEN POINT 2% WHICH AREN'T MAN. TWENTY FOUR POINT 4% OF ARCHITECTS ARE WOMEN COMPARED TO SIXTY EIGHT POINT 8% WHICH ARE MEN AND 90% OF BUILDING PROFESSIONALS. ARE WOMEN COMPARED 283% WHICH ARE MEANT. AND FINALLY THE LANGUAGE CHANGES WE HAVE PROPOSED WILL CLARIFY FOR THE PUBLIC AND BUILDING OF THE FACIALS A SCOPE OF WORK INTERIOR DESIGNERS HAVE BEEN DOING OVER THE PAST THIRTY YEARS FOR SENATORS CRAVEN'S ORIGINAL IN INTO. AND THANK YOU TURN IT OVER TO QUESTIONS BY MEMBERS IN THE CHAMBER. MS WEAVING. HERE ON MUTE. PAULA J. AS COMMITTEE MEMBERS LEGISLATIVE STAFFING YES MY NAME IS ROSE MAYBE I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CC IDC THE CALGARY COUNCIL FOR INTERIOR DESIGN CERTIFICATION I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION LET US ADDRESS THE IS IT THE ISSUES THAT WERE PRESENTED TO US IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER. FIRST THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION FOR US TO ADDRESS HOW WE I'M- WE ARE COMPLYING WITH THE BAGLEY KEENE ACT. AND THE BAGLEY KEENE ACT IS PROVIDED TO ALL OF OUR NEW BOARD MEMBERS DURING THEIR BOARD OR ORIENTATION MEETING IN THE BOARD ORIENTATION. BINDER DURING THE NEW BORDER NUMBER ORIENTATION WE COVERED THE ACT AND THE BOARD MEMBERS ARE ASKED TO SIGN IN AND IT KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED THE BECKLEY KEEN ACT UNDERSTAND IT. AND WILL COMPLY WITH IT IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS FROM THEM AT THAT TIME THAT'S WHEN IT BAGLEY KEENE ACT AS A DRESSED WE MAKE EVERY EFFORT DURING OUR MEETINGS TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS FROM THE BACKLIT SCENE ACT ARE MET- ISSUE NUMBER TO STAMP ACCEPTANCE. AND FIRST OFF THE TITLE LAYPERSONS- INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT LICENSED REGISTERED OR DESIGN PROFESSIONALS M. C. C. A. B. C. BELIEVES THAT CERTIFIED INTERIOR DESIGNER DESIGNER SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN THIS GROUP WITHIN THE ABOVE DEFINITION. WHO PRACTICE UNDER THE EXEMPTIONS OF- BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE FIFTY FIVE THIRTY SEVEN OF FIFTY FIVE THIRTY EIGHT M. C. C. IDEAS ARE EMBEDDED FOR EDUCATION EXPERIENCE AND TESTED ON CALIFORNIA CODES AND TITLE TWENTY FOUR REGULATIONS. ALONG WITH CALIFORNIA LAWS AND STATUES THAT ARE RELEVANT TO INTERIOR DESIGNERS AND HVE A SPECIFIED AMOUNT AGAIN EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE- SEE IDEAS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED LAY PERSONS THEY ARE DESIGN PROFESSIONALS. AN IT SHOULD BE POINTED OUT. BUT THE ONLY GROUP HAT HAS ANY SAY ON WHO MAY OR MAY NOT SUBMIT PLANS FOR THE PERMIT PERMITS OR THE BUILDING OFFICIALS BUILDING OFFICIALS ARE NOT LICENSED BY THE STATE AND THEREFORE HAVE NO OVERSIGHT OTHER THAN THE PURVIEW OF THE INDIVIDUAL CITIES AND COUNTIES THEY WORK FOR WHILE MANY BUT IT BUILDING DEPARTMENTS ARE CONVERSANT WITH THE C. IDEOLOGUE AND ACCEPT NON STRUCTURAL AND NON SEISMIC PLANS. THERE ARE SEVERAL WHO DO NOT BECAUSE- WHO. DELAYED BECAUSE THEY FEEL THE ONLY VIABLE OPTION IS TO ACCEPT PLANS ONLY FROM. LICENSED ARCHITECTS AND ENGINEERS. BUILDING OFFICIALS HAVE STATED THAT IF THE LANGUAGE IN OUR TITLE ACT WAS CLARIFIED WITH WHAT C. IDEAS DO THEY WOULD NOT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH PLAN SUBMISSIONS. THIS IS THE GOAL THAT WOULD BENEFIT THE DESIGN PROFESSION IN CALIFORNIA YIELDED RESULTS DUE TO THE FACT THAT CERTAIN PARTIES- HAVE ONLY THEIR AGENDA IN MIND AND IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO WORK WITH FINDING A COMPROMISING SOLUTION. CC IDC SERVES THE INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSION AS A WHOLE IT IS IMPOSED ON IMPROVING PLAN SUBMISSIONS FOR EVERYONE THAT WE SERVE. CURRENTLY THERE ARE SEVEN DESIGN RELATED PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS- A. I. B. T. THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF BUILDING DESIGN WORK HAS FOUR C. ID MEMBERS S. I. D. AMERICAN SOCIETY OF INTERIOR DESIGNERS FOUR HUNDRED AND TWELVE C. EIGHTY MEMBERS TO NOTE THAT EIGHTY NINE OF THOSE ARE PROFESSIONAL MEMBERS HAVING PASSED IN CA. ID Q. JUST DESIRE SOCIETY OF AMERICA WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE ANY CITIES LISTED- INTERIOR DESIGN EDUCATION- COUNCIL WE HAVE SIX CAT'S. WITHIN MEMBERSHIP. INTERIOR DESIGN SOCIETY. WE HAVE TWENTY SIX THE- INTERIOR INTERNATIONAL FURNISHING AND DESIGN ASSOCIATION FOURTEEN SEE EIGHTIES. AND THE INTERNATIONAL INTERIOR DESIGN ASSOCIATION TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT EIGHT C. EIGHTIES ARE MEMBERS OF THOSE HUNDRED AND SIX ARE PROFESSIONALS. HAVING PASSED INTO GET A Q. NKPA WHICH THE NATIONAL KITCHEN AND BATH ASSOCIATION OF EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHTY MEMBERS. ANY UNITED STATES GREEN BUILDING COUNCIL TWENTY FOUR C. ID MEMBERS WE ALSO REPRESENT TWELVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE C. ID'S WHO DO NOT BELONG TO ANY PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. OF THOSE SEVENTY FOUR OF STATE TODAY I AM SPECIALIZE IN COMMERCIAL INTERIOR DESIGN. OF THE TWO HUNDRED ED TWENTY FOUR. DESIGNERS I'M AT EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR BELONG TO ONE OR MORE PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS THE REST ARE DO NOT BELONG TO ANY. TWO OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE ONLY WILLING TO WORK WITH CC IDC IF THERE IF CC IDC IS TO GIVE IN TO DEMANDS. AS SUCH AS ONLY USING THE MCAD Q. AS REQUIRED THAT TEST FOR CERTIFICATION AND ALSO REQUIRING MORE CONTROL OF THE CC IDC BOARD MEETING WHERE THIS COMMERCIAL DESIGNATION WAS CREATED LEADERS OF BOTH OF THESE GROUPS PARTICIPATED IN CREATING THE GUIDELINES FOR THE DESIGNATION AND AGREED TO IT. TWO DAYS PRIOR BEFORE THE COMMERCIAL DESIGNATION BEING PRESENTED TO THE BOARD. AND A DEMAND LETTER WAS SENT SAYING THEY WOULD ONLY SUPPORT COMMERCIAL DESIGNATION IF CCAD GREED. THE ONLY UC AND C. C. R. E. Q. IN PLACE THREE NEWPORT POSITION SMITH MEMBERS FROM THEIR ORGANIZATION ON OUR BOARD. CCBC BOOK AWARD REMINDED THEM THAT EVERY ORGANIZATION HAS EQUAL REPRESENTATION ARE ABOARD AND THAT INEQUITIES OF THE INSANITY Q. AS CERTIFICATION EXAM FOR CALPERS AND- CALIFORNIA HAVE ALREADY BEEN PROVEN. ANY ADDITIONAL CERTIFICATION TITLE REGISTRATION OR LICENSURE WILL HAVE NO MERIT UNLESS THERE'S A STRENGTHENING AND CLARIFICATION OF THE LAW THAT IS CURRENTLY IN PLACE. THIS TITLE WILL NOT ALLOW ANYONE TO DO ANY MORE WORK THAN WHAT WAS ALLOWED UNDER THE EXEMPTIONS IN FIFTY FIVE THIRTY SEVEN OF FIFTY FIVE THIRTY EIGHT OF THE ARCHITECTS ACT. REGARDLESS OF INTERIOR DESIGNERS PRESENT CREDENTIALS OR EXAMINATIONS THEY HAVE PASSED THE REVIEW AND APPROVAL CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS WILL ALWAYS BE UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE BUILDING OFFICIAL HOLDING THE COMMERCIAL CERTIFIED. DESIGNER TITLE OUT TO DO SO IS ILL ADVISED AND WOULD RESULT IN FURTHER FRUSTRATION TO CALIFORNIA INTERIOR DESIGNERS IN BUILDING OFFICIALS ALIKE. AGAIN MAY I STATE THAT THE BUILDING A COMMERCIAL INTERIOR DESIGNERS THERE THE SAME WITH ARCHITECTS THERE'S NO SUCH THING IS COMMERCIAL AND OR- RESIDENTIAL INTERIOR DESIGNERS MAY CHOOSE THAT PATH OF BUSINESS BUT DATE WOULD CHANGE AS IN. WHEN THE- CURRENT- PANDEMIC HAPPENED A LOT OF THE INTERIOR DESIGNERS WHO WERE PUT OUT OF WORK FOR COMMERCIAL WENT BACK TO RESIDENTIAL WHEN THERE WAS A- RECESSION PREVIOUSLY IT WAS THE OPPOSITE THERE WAS A LOT OF RESIDENTIAL WORK SO PEOPLE CHANGE TO COMMERCIAL SO THERE IS NO HARD FAST I AM A CERTIFIED COMMERCIAL JETLINER OR- RESIDENTIAL DESIGNER. HEY HAS SHOWN IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS THAT THEY WILL NOT SUPPORT THE CLARIFYING LANGUAGE IN THE CAP LEGISLATION. INITIALLY IT WAS BECAUSE- OF THE ISSUE OF SAFETY OF THE BUILDING. THEN THEIR CONCERN CHANGED TO THE NEW DESERT DEFINITION OF SEISMIC WE WERE TOLD THAT IF THIS IS THE WORK DESIGNERS WANT TO DO THAT THEY SHOULD GO BACK TO SCHOOL TO BECOME ARCHITECTS. AGAIN WITH A- PREDOMINATELY- WOMEN LED INDUSTRY THAT'S NOT SPAM VERY PREJUDICIAL STATEMENT. CCAC WILL HOWEVER CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE BENEFIT AND BENEFIT CALIFORNIA'S INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSION AS A WHOLE. ISSUE NUMBER THREE THE COMMERCIAL DESIGNATION. HE AGAIN C. IDEAS ARE AT THE MERCY OF INDIVIDUAL BUILDING OFFICIALS AND THEIR POLICIES REGARDING FAN CHECK ACCEPTANCE AND PERMIT PERMIT ISSUANCE EVERY BUILDING DEPARTMENT IS DIFFERENT AND IS BUILDING OFFICIALS COME AND GO OUR POLICIES MAY CHANGE THE ONLY WAY TO CHANGE THIS IS TO STRENGTHEN THIS CURRENCY ID LAW BY ADDING PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED LANGUAGE ALLOWING C. IDEAS ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH THE COMMERCIAL DESIGNATION THE ABILITY TO DO HORIZONTAL EXITING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CBC. THE A. I. A. AND PERHAPS OTHERS WILL PUSH BACK ON THIS RECOMMENDATION EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE MANY BUILDING DEPARTMENTS AND OFFICIALS THAT ALLOWED THIS. I THINK YOU HAVE ONE MORE THAT IS THE- YES CONTRACT ISSUE ISSUE NUMBER THE CONTRACT YES. I'M. WE CAN WE CAN SERVE YOU WE CAN SIMPLY ASK QUESTIONS IF THAT. WOULD MAKE IT EASIER. M. A. THE ONLY CONTRACT ISSUE CCCC IDC IS THE ONLY AIRPORT IN THE COUNTRY THAT IS SPECIFIC CONTACT INFORMATION AND CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS WRITTEN INTO A STATUTE FOR INTERIOR DESIGNERS OTHER STATES MAY REQUIRE CONTRACT BUT THEY DON'T SAY WHAT KIND. AND WHAT PROTECTIONS SHOULD BE IN IT FOR THE CONSUMER MANSI IDEAS HAVE CONVOLUTED OR NO CONTRACT AT ALL- SO TRYING TO PROTECT THE DESIGNER AND NOT THE CLIENT OR THE CONSUMER SO WE DO HAVE IT IN OUR STATUTE. IF A DESIGNER C. IDE- WERE FOUND NOT TO BE USING A CONTRACT AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE BROUGHT UP WHERE- WITH THE BOARD AS A VIOLATION OF THE CODE OF ETHICS AND THEY COULD LOSE THEIR CERTIFICATION. OKAY OKAY- MEMBERS SHARE BERMAN YOU'VE BEEN WAITING PATIENTLY THANK YOU CHAIR OFTEN AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATIONS THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN COVERED I MIGHT HAVE I MIGHT HAVE MISSED IT I KNOW THIS IS YEAH I KNOW THIS ISSUE IS TALKED ABOUT BUT- IN SPECIFIC. ABOUT THE- C. ID STAMP IN PLANES BEING REJECTED BY BUILDING OFFICIALS. DO WE HAVE ANY DATA ON HOW OFTEN THAT'S HAPPENED AND WHAT REMEDIES IF ANY ARE AVAILABLE TO CERTIFIED INTERIOR DESIGNERS WHEN THAT DOES HAPPEN. WE DON'T HAVE ACTUAL DATA BECAUSE IT'S NOT REPORTED TO US EVERY TIME THAT HAPPENS- BUT WHAT GENERALLY WILL HAPPEN IF THE C. I. D. IS Q. M. YOU HAVE THEIR PLANS PUSH BACK AND HAVE TO HIRE AN ARCHITECT. THIS MEANS THAT THE ARCHITECT HAS TO REDO THE WORK ALTOGETHER BECAUSE A AN ARCHITECT CANNOT STAMP ANOTHER PERSON'S DRAWINGS A COTTON CANDY. CAUSING CONSIDERABLE COST AND TIME DELAY FOR THE- PROJECT. AND ARE ANY REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO IT TO SORT OF FIND YOUR DESIRES WHEN THIS DOES HAPPEN OR OR DO THEY JUST HAVE TO KIND OF ACCEPT THE BUILDING OFFICIALS- DECISION AND- ACT ACCORDINGLY. THANK THEY HAVE TO ACCEPT THE DECISION WHAT GENERALLY WILL HAPPEN IS- I'M CERTIFIED INTERIOR DESIGNERS WILL CALL OUR OFFICE IF THEY HAVE A PLAN CHECK DENIAL. I'M WE HAVE A GREAT WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH A LOT OF THE BUILDING OFFICIALS AND WE CAN CONTACT AND HAVE A CONVERSATION. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN IT IS NEW PLAN CHECKING STAFF THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN EDUCATED- CCAC WORKS HARD TO WORK WITH. THE COMBO AND THE LOCAL ICC CHAPTERS TO EDUCATE BUILDING OFFICIALS BUT- UNTIL THEY ALL ARE IT'S ALL THIS IS CLEAR THE LANGUAGE GETS CLARIFIED THIS WILL BE AN ONGOING ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU A GERMAN. LET ME JUST ASK A COUPLE BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES- THE BAGLEY KEENE OPEN MEETINGS ACT REQUIREMENTS I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE FROM THE TESTIMONY TODAY WHAT EXACTLY. IT IS THE- COUNCIL DOES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH BAGLEY KEENE SO. I'M NOT GOING TO BELABOR IT HERE BUT WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE IS A WRITTEN SUBMISSION TO. US THE STAFF OF BOTH COMMITTEES AS TO YOUR EFFORTS TO COMPLY WHICH IS. OF COURSE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU PUBLICLY NOTICED MEETINGS AT LEAST TEN DAYS PRIOR TO THE MEETING. POSTED JAN DOES IN A WHOLE VARIETY OF OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY LISTED THE DO APPLY THAT SUBMISSION OF THE DOES YOU KNOW THE BACKGROUND PAPER- SITES TO THE FACT THAT YOU WERE CURRENT BYLAWS APPARENTLY CURRENT BYLAWS- DO NOT SEEM TO TRACK WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF BAGLEY KEENE SO. YEAH I'M SURE YOU PROBABLY DO BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME AND IT MAY NOT BE CLEAR TO MY COLLEAGUES ON ON THE COMMITTEES AND WE'D LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS BEFORE WE MOVE. FORWARD WITH SUNSET. ON THE ISSUE OF CONTRACTS- I HAVEN'T SPECIFICALLY PULLED THE SECTION THAT'S REFERENCED IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER TO CHECK BUT IT BESIDES THE FACT THAT A WRITTEN CONTRACT IS REQUIRED SO WHAT IS IT WHAT IS IT EXACTLY THAT THE COUNCIL DOES TO ENSURE THAT- INDIVIDUALS SUBJECT TO- THE COUNCIL. DO ENTER INTO WRITTEN CONTRACTS WITH CLIENTS. CERTAINLY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WHEN THEY SIGN THEIR APPLICATION FORM THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE SHOWN IS REQUIRED THERE GIVEN THE- GUIDELINES OF WHAT THEIR CONTRACTS ARE. THE ISSUE COMES WHEN THERE ARE CERTIFIED INTERIOR DESIGNERS THAT WORK FOR LARGE CORPORATIONS- THOSE CORPORATIONS WILL BE THE ONES DOING THE CONTRACTS NOT THE CERTIFIED INTERIOR DESIGNERS AND A LARGE POPULATION OF OUR SURVEY INTERIOR DESIGNERS WORK FOR THESE CORPORATIONS- BUT WE DO. MONITOR THIS BASED ON COMPLAINTS IF THERE ARE COMPLAINTS THAN THEIR PART BEFORE THE BOARDING COULD LOSE THEIR CERTIFICATION BUT WE HAD NO SUCH COMPLAINTS- REGARDING CONTRACTS SO OTHER THAN US EDUCATING THEM GIVING THEM THE INFORMATION THEM SIGNING THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT UNTIL A COMPLAINT IS RECEIVED. THERE'S NO FURTHER WAY THAT WE CAN- ENFORCE IT. WELL THANK YOU THAT THAT ANSWER THE QUESTION YOU. ADDRESS THE ISSUE HAVING TO DO WITH THE EIGHTY THREE COMPLAINTS REFERENCED IN THE BACKGROUND REPORT AND I APPRECIATED MEMBERS. ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS I SEE. NO MICROPHONES UP SO LET'S MOVE TO. TESTIMONY FROM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR INTERIOR DESIGN CERTIFICATION FIRST- THAT'S BEING BEGIN WITH WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY WE HAVE A WITNESS IN THE GALLERY PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MEMBERS- MY NAME IS LAURA TAYLOR I'M A COMMERCIAL INTERIOR DESIGNER AND I REPRESENT. IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE INTERIOR DESIGN INTERNATIONAL INTERIOR DESIGN ASSOCIATION OR THE I. IDA- SPECIFICALLY I WANT TO COMMENT ON THE COMMERCIAL DESIGNATION WHICH WAS MENTIONED SO. I WANT TO SUPPORT THE DESIGNATION OF A COMMERCIAL INTERIOR DESIGNER IT WAS MENTIONED THAT THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL. INTERIOR DESIGNER BUT THEN WHY DOES IT NEED THE DIFFERENCE- AS A COMMERCIAL INJURED IS THERE IT IS A DISTINCT SCOPE OF PRACTICE. WE PRACTICE IN THE CODE IMPACTED ENVIRONMENT SO. WE WORK ON PROJECTS LIKE AIRPORTS HOSPITALS WORK SPACES- RESTAURANTS ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT DIVERSE ARRAY OF PROJECTS- AND WE WORK ALONGSIDE PEER PROFESSIONAL SO ARCHITECTS ENGINEERS. LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS- WHO ALL HAVE STAMPS. THEY GIVE THEM EXPANDED PRACTICES- AND AS IT WAS MENTIONED WE HAVE AN ISSUE WITH OUR STAMP ACCEPTANCE BUT WE ALSO DON'T FOLLOW THE SAME. CERTIFICATION STRUCTURE THAT THOSE. PROFESSIONALS DO- SO THOSE BEER PROFESSIONAL SIT FOR THE NATIONAL STANDARD EXAM. AND THEN THEY SAID FOR A CALIFORNIA SUPPLEMENTAL EXAM. AND THEN THEY RECEIVE STATE CERTIFICATION WITH THOSE EXPANDED PRIVILEGES- SO THE MCAD Q. WHICH WAS MENTIONED. THE NATIONAL STANDARD EXAM FOR COMMERCIAL INTERIOR DESIGN COMPETENCE AND THAT EXAM IS NOT REQUIRED FOR A C. ID. OR FOR THE COMMERCIAL DESIGNATION- SO FOR US WHAT THAT MORE TYPICAL STRUCTURE REPAIR PROFESSIONALS MIGHT LOOK LIKE. WOULD BE SITTING HERE AFTER EDUCATION SITTING FOR THIS NATIONAL STANDARD EXAM. SITTING FOR A CALIFORNIA SUPPLEMENTAL EXAM WHICH COULD BE EXISTING IDEX EXAM IT COVERS IMPORTANT TOPICS CALIFORNIA CODE SAFETY ISSUES THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO OUR STATE VERY IMPORTANT. AND THEN RECEIVING A STATE CERTIFICATION THAT GIVES US THOSE EXPANDED PRACTICE PRIVILEGES- I DON'T THINK THAT WE WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT ON ANYTHING. IN THE C. EIGHT THAT WORKS WELL FOR. RESIDENTIAL DESIGNERS ARE OTHER DESIGNERS IF THE CERTIFICATION WORKS FOR THEN THAT'S FANTASTIC- I WANT TO RECOMMEND TO THIS COMMITTEE AND TO THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE SOME TIME. TO REVIEW THIS ERTIFICATION- AND MAKE SOME MEANINGFUL PROGRESS ON THE ISSUES OF STAMP ACCEPT ACCEPTANCE AND- TESTING. THAT HAVE COME UP SEVERAL SUNSET REVIEWS IN A ROW- AND I WANT TO OFFER THE ENTIRE DESIGN ASSOCIATION MYSELF. AS A RESOURCE FOR QUESTIONS AND CONTEXT. AND I DON'T YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO ASK THAT WE NOT EXTEND FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEARS. THE CERTIFICATION THAT IS CLEARLY NOT WORKING FOR SOME COMMERCIAL INTERIORS THERE'S LIKE MYSELF. AND INSTEAD MAKE SOME SOME MEANINGFUL PROGRESS TO FURTHER CONVERSATIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO COME AND TO PROVIDE YOUR COMMENT AND WE WILL- WE WILL ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. ANY FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT IN THE GALLERY I SEE SOMEONE APPROACHING THE MICROPHONE SIR PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD AND PROCEED- HI FOLKS HOW'S IT GOING- MY NAME IS ADAM NEWTON AND WITH MY COLLEAGUE LAURA. I AM ALSO HERE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF IDA NORTHERN CALIFORNIA- I WORK AS A PROJECT MANAGER FOR SUTTER HEALTH I'M ACTUALLY ACTUALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY BECAUSE- MY TERRITORY IS CEMENTED SETTERS BUILDINGS AND CAPITAL PROJECTS AND- ASSEMBLYMEMBER. BERMAN'S DISTRICT I HE'S DOWN THERE NINE AN ARCHITECT BUT CHOSE TO PRACTICE. IN A COMMERCIAL INTERIOR DESIGN SCOPE SPECIFICALLY DOING HEALTHCARE INTERIORS ADDS A LITTLE BRAGGING ABOUT I LIKE TO SAY IF YOU'VE BEEN IN A HOSPITAL IN THE BAY AREA YOU'VE LIKELY. BEEN IN ONE OF MY PROJECTS OR AT LEAST USE ONE OF THEM. THE PLACEMENT WALLS AND CEILINGS- SPECIFICATION OF FIRE RESISTANT FABRICS. THE DESIGN OF YOUR LOCAL HOSPITAL EMERGENCY OR DELIVERY ROOMS- EVEN YOUR KID'S CLASSROOM. ARE ALL THINGS AND ENDURES HONORS QUALIFIED TO DO. AND THIS WORK THE WORK THAT WE DO HAS HELPED ELEVATE CALIFORNIA'S INTERIOR SPACES TO LEAD IN THE COUNTRY AND SUSTAINABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY. AND FIRE AND LIFE SAFETY. DESPITE THIS THOUGH IF YOUR DESIGN IS THE ONLY DESIGN PROFESSION IN THE STATE WITHOUT A NATIONAL STANDARD EXAM. AND A REGULATING STATE AGENCY. THAT'S SOMEONE WHOSE PRACTICE IN ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN AND NOW AS AN OWNER'S RAP I CAN TELL YOU IT HERE IS THAT DESIGNERS HAVE A UNIQUE EXPERTISE TO CREATE FUNCTIONAL AND MEANINGFUL SPACES HOMELESS HOUSING PROJECTS IT WAS MY INTERIOR DESIGN EXPERTISE THAT LED ME TO PROPOSE ADDITIONAL INSULATION FOR WALLS TO HELP- VETERANS WHO WITH GOOD EXPERIENCE AUDITORY TRIGGERS. FOR LOUD URBAN ENVIRONMENTS. IT WAS ALSO MY EXPERTISE- THAT HEALTH PLAN A PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY UNIT WITH BUILT IN FLOORING INDICATORS TO INDICATE SAFETY THRESHOLDS FOR STAFF WHEN DEALING WITH COMPLICATED PATIENTS. AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD TODAY- THIS PROFESSION IS LED BY WOMEN MEMBERS OF THE BUYBACK UNITY AND I'LL SPEAK TO KEEP PEOPLE. THE LACK OF STANDARDIZED PRIVILEGES THAT ALIGN WITH OUR PEER DESIGN PROFESSIONALS LIKE ARCHITECTS OR CIVIL ENGINEERS. MAKES IT JUST THAT MUCH HARDER TO COMPETE ECONOMICALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY. AS A MEMBER OF THE QUEER COMMUNITY MYSELF I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE LACK OF STANDARDIZED CODE FIVE PRIVILEGES FACING OUR PROFESSION IS OF INCREDIBLE IMPORTANCE TO CORRECT. AND IF THERE'S ONE BIG THING I WANT YOU TO ALL OF YOU KNOW TAKE AWAY FROM THIS- IT'S A COMMERCIAL INTERIORS THE DESIGNERS WANT PROPER LEGAL REGULATION. AND PRIVILEGES FOR THE WORK THAT WE ARE QUALIFIED TO DO IT AND ACTUALLY ARE ALREADY DOING. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE COMMITTEE TO LIKE MY COLLEAGUE LAURA SAID IT TAKE A PROGRESSIVE STEP AND GRANT AN EXTENSION OF TIME FOR THIS PROFESSION TO BE. THOROUGHLY EXAMINED INSTEAD OF JUST KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD ANOTHER FOUR YEARS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOUSIR FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR COMMENTS. ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY. SEEING NO OTHER WITNESSES- LET'S MOVE TO WITNESSES WAITING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT- THROUGH THE TELECONFERENCE SERVICE. MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD PLEASE. THE MONEY ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR COUNCIL WE SHOW. PROCEED THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN THE GENTLEMAN TO PROVIDE COMMENT PRESS ONE ZERO TO BE PROVIDED WITH A LINE NUMBER YOU MY NUMBER IS CALLED ST UNIFICATION TO LEGISLATIVE RECORD WE GO NOT A LINE NUMBER ELEVEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN. SIX THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARK CHRISTIAN WITH THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS CALIFORNIA. A. I. CALIFORNIA SUPPORTS EXTENDING THE SUNSET DATE FOR US HE ID TWO YEARS BECAUSE SHE C. IDC DOES PROVIDE A BENEFIT TO CONSUMERS. INTERIOR DESIGNERS AND ANYONE ELSE WITH ANY OTHER UNLICENSED PERSON CAN PROVIDE DESIGN SERVICES. UNDER AN EXEMPTION IN THE ARCHITECTS PRACTICE ACT THAT EXEMPTION ALLOWS ANYONE TO PROVIDE CLIENT SERVICES FOR NON STRUCTURAL AND NON SEISMIC WORK IN WORK THAT DOES NOT AFFECT THE SAFETY OF THE BUILDING. WORK THAT DOES INVOLVE THE DESIGN OF STRUCTURAL OR SEISMIC WORK WITH THAT DOES AFFECT THE SAFETY OF THE BUILDING IT HAS TO BE PREPARED BY AN ARCHITECT AND ENGINEER. THIS IS LONG ESTABLISHED LAW. SO FOR THE EXEMPTION. P. C. ID SEE- PROVIDES A BENEFIT TO CONSUMERS- CONSUMER DOES THAT SOMEONE WHO IS A CERTIFIED INTERIOR DESIGNER IS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS DEMONSTRATED COMPETENCE THROUGH THE THREE E. EDUCATION EXPERIENCE AND EXAMINATION THAT'S THE VALUE TO THE CONSUMER AND WHY WE SUPPORT EXTENDING THE SUNSET DATE ON THE LAW TO ALLOW CCA QC TO CERTIFY ENTER SIGNERS. ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT- SOME. INFORMATION ALONG HOPEFULLY YOU'LL- FIND OUT PLEASE. ABOUT PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS AND ARCHITECTURAL SCHOOLS TODAY IN THE UNITED STATES ARE WOMEN MORE WOMEN ARE ENTERED INTO THE PROFESSION OF ARCHITECTURE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY WHERE THERE IS COMPLETE PARITY IN THE PRACTICE OF ARCHITECTURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SIR. MODERATOR NEXT PLEASE. NEXT JULY THIRTEENTH PLEASE GO AHEAD. CHAIRMAN ROSTENKOWSKI CHAIRMAN BERMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY MY NAME IS MATTHEW BRUCHE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS MANAGER FOR THE COUNCIL FOR INTERIOR DESIGN QUALIFICATION. INTO THE WRITTEN COMMENTS SUBMITTED BY OUR CEO TOM BANKS IN SUPPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL INTERIOR DESIGN ASSOCIATION REQUEST FOR COLLABORATION. I WOULD LIKE TO SUBMIT THE FOLLOWING CLARIFYING COMMENTS AS THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT DEAL MENTION OF THE M. J. Q. IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER AND IN STATE TAX MONEY. SO I WOULD LIKE TO PRIDE COMMITTEE BACKS. THE NCAA QUEUED THEM IF THE NATIONAL STANDARD FOR COMPARTMENT YES THAT'S AN INTERIOR DESIGN. THE MCAD Q. EXAMINES THE PREREQUISITE FOR CERTIFYING THE CARRIAGES ON REGULAR REGISTRATION OR LICENSURE IN THIRTY U. S. JURISDICTIONS. AND ALL CANADIAN PROVINCES. STATE LEGISLATORS RECOGNIZED THE M. K. Q. AND CONTINUE TO DO SO AND UTILIZING DAMMIT THE BASIS FOR REASONABLE REGULATION. EXEMPLIFIED BY THE PASSAGE OF NORTH CAROLINA'S TITLE ACT LAST YEAR AND BY LEGISLATION IS STATUS THE PERMITTING FROM WHICH THE JOURNALING MOVING IN WISCONSIN ILLINOIS AND IOWA. LANGUAGE WHICH HAS ALL BEEN AGREED UPON WITH EACH DAY COMPONENT OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS. AND CREATE THE EXACT KIND OF CLARIFYING LANGUAGE THAT MISLEADS SPOKE UP IN THAT BUILDING OFFICIALS ARE REQUESTING. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS UNIQUE NEEDS IN REGULATING THE DESIGN PROFESSIONS DO IT STATES IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE STANDARDS CITED REASON AGAINST UTILIZATION OF A NATIONAL INTERIORS ARE CONFIDENT. AND IS THIS STAGE PRIVATE TO DECIDE HOW TO ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS. THAT IS HOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAME TO REQUIRE CALIFORNIA SUPPLEMENTAL EXAMINATION. IN ADDITION TO NATIONAL COMPETITION IS ABSENT THOSE REQUIREMENTS FOR LICENSURE IN SEVERAL OTHER REGULATED PROFESSIONS. THIS MODEL APPEARS TO HAVE WORKED FOR CALIFORNIA AND ALLOWING ITS WORKERS TO ENJOY THE BENEFITS AND RIGOR OF KNOWN CERTIFICATION VOLUNTEERING THAT SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC IS-CONTINUE TO BE PROTECTED AND THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THE STATE. OUR MAPS. THEY THEY'RE THINKING GROWED AND HOW THE STATE REGULATES THE DESIGN PROFESSION COMPETENCY ASSESSMENT WITH EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS UTILIZING CONJUNCTION WITH CFT IS IT HOW CALIFORNIA REGULATES ALL OTHER DESIGN PROFESSIONS INCLUDING ARCHITECTURE. WHICH HAS TO STING SIMILARITIES WITH INTERIOR DESIGN. ONLY INTERIOR DESIGN DOES NOT HAVE THIS MODEL. IT HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED THERE ARE MANY AREAS OF CORRELATION BETWEEN THE PRESENCE OF ARCHITECTURE DESIGN INCLUDING REQUIRED AREAS OF COMPETENCY AND PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS THAT ARE SIMILAR AND SUBSTANTIALLY I AND SOME CASES SOME STRANGELY IDENTICAL. RECENT RESEARCH CONDUCTED BY CID QUEUE AND THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF ARCHITECTURAL REGISTRATION BOARDS. SHOWED SIGNIFICANT SIMILARITIES BETWEEN OUR RESPECTIVE PRACTICE NOW PLEAD AND EXAM. A GROUP OF SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS FROM BOTH ORGANIZATIONS FOUND THAT EIGHTY THREE POINT 3% OF THE OBJECTIVES KNOWLEDGE AREAS OF THE MCAT QUEUE WITH THEM. HAD DEFINITE- SOME SIMILARITY TO OUR OBJECTIVES AND OUR KNOWLEDGE AREAS OF AND CARS ARCHITECT REGISTRATION EXAM. THAT IS NOT TO SAY THE TWO EXAMS ARE THE SAME THEY ARE NOT. THE ENTIRE QUEUE IS THE NATIONAL CERTIFICATION FOR INTERIOR DESIGN. JUST AS THE A. R. E. IF THE NATIONAL LICENSURE EXAMINATION FOR OUR TAX. THEY BOTH SUFFICIENTLY AND ADEQUATELY ADAPT COMPETENCY IN THE SCOPES OF PRACTICE ON EACH PROFESSION. WHICH WHILE THE STATE DOES CARRY MANY SIMILARITIES. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOES CURRENTLY UTILIZE THE AIRY BUT NOT THE MCAD Q. SIR. AND FINALLY I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT WE HAVE ALL THE SAME CARD GO AHEAD AND GO WITH THIS ISSUE THE PUBLIC PROTECTION HOW SAFETY WELFARE. IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. I WILL CONCLUDE JUST BY SAYING THAT THESE FACTS FOR OUT A SIMPLE REALITY WE AGREE. WITH EARLIER TESTIMONY THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD CRITICALLY RE EXAMINE THE CERTIFIED INTERIOR DESIGNER STYLE ACT. AND HOW TO REGULATE THE PROFESSION OF INTERIOR DESIGN. NOT DOING SO THE DISSERVICE TO PREDOMINATELY FEMALE FASHION. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS NOT REVISITED THE FRAMEWORKS AND THE PASSAGE OF THE INITIAL ARM IN NINETEEN NINETY. AREA DEVELOPMENT OF NOT ONLY THE INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSION BUT REGULATION AS WELL HAVE TAKEN PLACE DURING THAT TIME. U. DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDE SEVERAL STATES HAVE PASSED LEGISLATION GRANTING AND HEARING CERTIFIED HERE DESIGNER STEPHAN CEILING PRIVILEGES ESTABLISHING JOINT OR- IN SOME CASES- PROVIDING PERMANENT VILLAGES ALL IN THE PAST AND BASED ON THE PASSAGE OF THE UNDEAD GIVE. SIR NOT ONLY IS THIS CURRENT HELLO YEAH. YOU HAVE NOW MOVED NEAR ME YES I CAN VERY WELL AND YOU'RE NOW MOVING TO FIVE MINUTES WHICH IS. ALMOST THREE TIMES. WELL LET ME JUST SAY THIS.

THE COMPANY ME TODAY IS OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICER HEATHER MARTIN AND JUST A REALLY QUICK GRATITUDE CHECK- FOR THE BOARD STAFF AND BOARD TO YOU KNOW MAKE GREAT PAINTER PUTTING THE SUNSET REVIEW TOGETHER SO JUST TO BE PART OF HISTORY ABOUT OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY. THE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY PROFESSIONAL WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN SEVENTEEN AND IS ONE OF THE OLDEST ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. SENATE BILL ONE ZERO FOUR SIX CREATED THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY ON JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND AND ONE THE BOARD'S MISSION AND RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS AS OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY SERVICES THROUGH EFFECTIVE REGULATION AND APPROPRIATE LICENSING OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY. OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST KNOWN AS O. T. AS IN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY ASSISTANTS KNOWN AS O. T. A.'S TOGETHER THEY COMPRISE WHAT WE CALL. A CHRISTIAN THERAPY PRACTITIONERS. WHEN THE BOARD STARTED INTO THOU ONE YOU WAS DESTINED THAT THERE BE UPON. EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED NEWLY LIFE OCCUPATIONAL PRACTITIONERS IN CALIFORNIA. BY THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR 200-082-0009 THERE WERE NEARLY THIRTEEN THOUSAND LICENSEES AND TODAY THERE ARE MORE THAN A LITTLE OVER NINETEEN THOUSAND. THE VALUE OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY SERVICES AS NOTED BY THE NUMBER OF NEW OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA. IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE THERE WERE SIX OKAY PROGRAMS AND FOR- EXCUSE ME SIX OH DEEPER. GIVE ME. THERE WERE- SIX OH TWO PROGRAMS AND FOR OTA PROGRAMS THAT NUMBER IS NOW DOUBLED. THERE ARE CURRENTLY TEN OH TWO PROGRAMS AND ELEVEN OTA PROGRAMS WITH SIX ADDITIONAL SCHOOLS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING EITHER IN O. T. R. O. TA PROGRAM. UNDER ACCREDITATION. TO SUPPORT CONSUMER PROTECTION BOARD ESTABLISHED ETHICAL STANDARDS OF PRACTICE STANDARDS OF PRACTICE FOR TELEHEALTH. SUPERVISION REQUIREMENTS ADVANCED PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR INFECTION CONTROL AND CONTINUING EDUCATION. COMPETENCY REQUIREMENTS. IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH MISSION BUT BOY. ENSURES A ELIGIBLE AND COLOR INDIVIDUALS ARE ISSUED A LICENSE AND INVESTIGATES COMPLAINTS CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS AND DISCIPLINE ORDERS ISSUED BY OTHER STATES. THE BOARD STATUTES REQUIRES INDIVIDUALS WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS ENGAGING IN THE PRACTICE OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY TO POSSESS A LICENSE. ANOTHER RISK IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO THE CODE PANDEMIC THERE WERE SEVERAL CHANGES. THE BOARD AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS MOTOR VIRTUAL PLATFORM BOARD STOCK BEGAN ROTATIONAL TELEWORK AND IN PERSON WORK SCHEDULES. THE BOARDED BY THE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY PRACTITIONERS THIS WAY FIRST ISSUED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. WEBSITE UPDATES AND THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE BOARD TRACKED OUT OF STATE LICENSE HE'S WORKING IN CALIFORNIA. UNDER THE AUTHORIZATION OF THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AUTHORITY. SINCE THE LAST SUNSET REVIEW HEARING IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN BOARD AMONG OTHER THINGS HAS PARTNERED I DON'T KNOW T. WORK FOR WORK FOR STUDY. UPDATED THE FUNCTIONALITY OF BREEZE. CREATED IT'S TWENTY TWENTY STRATEGIC PLAN AND BUILT UPON ITS STAKE HOLDERS OUTREACH THE BOARD CONTINUES TO WORK WITH APPOINTING AUTHORITIES ON BOARD APPOINTMENTS. THERE'S A DISCUSSION FOR ANY DIFFERENT- TEAMWORK FOR STUDY AS WELL AS DISCUSSION REVOLVING ADVANCED PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS RELEVANT TO UPDATED ACCREDITATION GUIDELINES AND CURRICULUM CHANGES. ALSO CONSIDERATION OF AN ATTESTATION ACKNOWLEDGING LAWS AND REGULATIONS REGULATIONS AND OR REQUIRING AN ETHICS COURSE FOR INITIAL OR RENEWAL APPLICATIONS AND LASTLY IT'S WORKING TO ENSURE FUTURE FISCAL SOLVENCY. WE. WELCOME ANY AND ALL QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MS MARTIN ANY FURTHER COME. YES THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON GERMAN ROTH VERNON COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAFF MY NAME IS HEATHER MARTIN IN AN EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY WHICH I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF SERVING AS- SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY REPORTER RESPONDING TO YOUR QUESTIONS AS WELL AS THE RECOMMENDATIONS PROVIDED IN THE PORTS BACKGROUND. THANK YOU THANK YOU LET'S TURN TO MEMBERS CHAIRMAN ANY QUESTIONS. THE TEACHER OFTEN AND THAN YOU FOR THE VERY CONCISE PRESENTATIONS- IN TERMS OF ISSUE NUMBER ONE- THAT THAT'S BEEN RAISED RELATED TO THE BOARD'S FUND CONDITION. HOW IS THE BOARD'S REVIEW OF PROPOSED FEE INCREASES COMING ALONG. THANK YOU FOR THAT GERMAN BERMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT BOARD IS TAKING PLACE- A LOOK AT THE FUND'S CONDITION YOU'RE VERY SERIOUSLY HISTORICALLY THE BOARDS REVENUE AND EXPENDITURES HAVE NOT BEEN IN ALIGNMENT DESPITE- AND YOU WERE VERSIONS THE REVENUE EARNED EACH YEAR- HAS BEEN LESS THAN B. EXPENDITURES- I BELIEVE IT WAS NOTED AND EVEN BACK AS FAR AS THE BOARD'S TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SENSOR REPORT- WHAT THE BOARD DID DO WAS PROMULGATE REGULATIONS FOR MODEST INCREASES IN THE RENEWAL FEES AND IT WAS A TWO STEP PROCESS. WHICH RAISE THE FEES FOR- TINO J. RENEWALS IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN AND THEN AGAIN AND- TWENTY TWENTY ONE UNFORTUNATELY THOSE FEES ALONE ARE INSUFFICIENT TO ENSURE YOU KNOW FUTURE FISCAL SOLVENCY WITH THE- WITH THE FUND AT RISK THE BOARD DID CAN DISCUSS THIS AT SEVERAL MEETINGS- LAST YEAR AND AT THE MOST RECENT MEETING THEY TOSSED AN AD HOC BUDGET COMMITTEE TO REVIEW. THE- POSTED INCREASE WHICH THERE WERE A VARIETY OF THEM AS WELL AS YOU KNOW EXPENDITURE REDUCTIONS TO REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT THE ISSUE I'M HAVING AN AD HOC COMMITTEE- WORK ON THIS TO YOU MORE THOROUGHLY BUT- THE ISSUE MAKE A RECOMMENDATION AT THE BOARD- THE BOARD'S NEXT MEETING THAT THAT IS THE- BEST PATH FORWARD. AND WE DO REALIZE THERE WILL BE TO BE A FEE INCREASE NOT SURE WHAT THAT WILL LOOK LIKE OR WHAT THAT WILL ENTAIL AND WE LOOK BOTH FOR TWO- COMPLETING THE COMMITTEES- FETAL QUESTIONERS WELLS PROVIDING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND- IN TERMS OF ISSUE NUMBER FOUR RELATED TO- TI'S OPERATING AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. HAS THE BOARD HEARD OF ISSUES WITH- KEYS WERE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CARE DUE TO THE NEED FOR THEIR CHANGES FOUR DO THE NEED FOR CHANGES IN THEIR BUSINESS MODELS- WE HAVE NOT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION SO- THERE. RIGHT NOW- CONCERNING THE CONTRACT ISSUE OTHER EMPLOYEE TO EMPLOYER RELATIONSHIP ISSUE HAS NOT REALLY BEEN DISCUSSED BY THE BOARD- WELL THIS APPEARS TO BE NOT SO MUCH A PRACTICE OR- PROTECTION ISSUE. THERE ARE MANY- TEAMS WHO ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND SO- THE BOARD LOOKS FORWARD TO DISCUSSING THE VALUE OF THAT SECTION OF THAT TO THE LABOR CODE FOR CONTRACTING A TEASE AT A FUTURE BOARD MEETING. AND KIND OF GETTING A LITTLE BIT BETTER DESCRIPTION OF HOW THE ALIGNMENT WITH INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS- T. BUSINESS MODELS TO WORK. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH JIM OR QUESTION. RELATED TO PRACTICE. ISSUE NUMBER. Q. TULSA BIT ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE DISCUSSION OF PHASING OUT ADVANCED PRACTICE CERTIFICATES. NOW THAT IT'S INCLUDED IN THE TYPICAL- T. EDUCATION. GREAT QUESTION THANK YOU AGAIN SO. THE BOARD DISCUSSED SEVERAL ITERATIONS OF THE BAND'S PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS- WITH THAT TWENTY EIGHTEEN ACCREDITATION STANDARDS GOING INTO EFFECT JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY. THE BOARD MAY FIND IT USEFUL TO INTERVIEW THE SCHOOLS ONCE AGAIN TO CLEAN THEIR ASSESSMENT OF STUDENT COMPETENCY IN THE AREAS OF. IT EXCUSE ME BEST PRACTICE WHICH ARE DISCLOSURE AND THEIR P. AND PHYSICAL AGENT MODALITIES- IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT ACCREDITATION STANDARD JUST FIVE MINIMUM EDUCATION CONTENT. HOWEVER THE STRATEGY NOT QUANTIFY THE AMOUNT OF TIME TO BE SPENT ON EACH TOPIC FOR EXAMPLE SOME EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS. PRIOR HOW YOU KNOW A LECTURE FOR THREE HOURS WHEN I'M CERTAIN CONTENT WITH OTHER SCHOOLS I CREATED A QUARTER OF CLASSES BUT NOW WITH THE ACCREDITATION STANDARDS IS THE TIME TO REVISIT THAT FOR SURE- REALLY THE COURSE DELIVERY IS LEFT UP TO EACH INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL TO DETERMINE AND IMPLEMENT IS WHY WE PROBABLY SHOULD. INTO THIS DISCUSSION TO FIND OUT IF WE'RE MEETING THOSE STANDARDS- AND IF IT'S DETERMINED THAT EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE EQUITABLE EDUCATION STANDARDS A DISCUSSION CAN ENSUE WHETHER TO CONTINUE WITH THE ADVANCED PRACTICE EDUCATION AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS OR REMOVE THEM. FOR FUTURE GRADUATES IF THEIR DEMAND. IS UNIQUE THERE BEING THAT UNIVERSALLY CONSUMER PROTECTION- BENEFITS CAN ONLY BE A TRIP ALL EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS MEET MINIMAL NATIONAL EDUCATION STANDARDS I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. I THINK YOU DID THANK YOU. VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE IT THANKS YOU'RE OFF. THANK YOU RICHARD X. QUEST HELLO WE JUST ASK A FOLLOW UP TO THE- DYNAMIX QUESTION INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR ONE OF THE ISSUES MAY BE WHETHER OCCUPATIONAL ULTIMATELY MAYBE WHETHER OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS ARE ACTUALLY ENGAGED IN AN INDEPENDENT. BUSINESS AND I WAS SO SORT OF FASCINATED BY THE BACKGROUND PAPER DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION ACT AND THE APPARENT STATUS WHICH IS THE- OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS ARE NOT PRESENTLY AUTHORIZED TO FORM. A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATIONS. DO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY EXPLANATION AS TO REASON FOR THAT LIMITATION AND- ONE AND TWO GIVEN THE LIMITATION WHAT ACTION ARE WE ENGAGED IN TO TRY TO FIX THAT BECAUSE IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT THAT WOULD BE. SOMETHING THAT AT LEAST SOME OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN- THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIRMAN SO. WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT IT AS A FULL BOARD BECAUSE IT HASN'T COME UP FOR DISCUSSION- BUT SEEING THE DYNAMICS OPERATIONS LESS. COURT INFORMATION THE BACKGROUND PAPER CERTAINLY BECAUSE- AN INTEREST IN US TO REVISIT THIS FOR FUTURE FOR DISCUSSION HOWEVER WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL BUSINESS MODELS OUT THERE THAT SUPPORT. OTC FUNCTIONING AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND THEY- WE DON'T KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT DO WE TALK TO SUPPORT HOW THEY ALIGN OR THEY DIFFER SO MUCH FROM- THE I'M SORRY THE OPERATIONS FROM. ARMS DYNAMICS SHE'S MADE UP TO LOOK AT THAT HERE SO WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO REVISITING NOT HOWEVER- THE INDEPENDENT WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT COME UP AS A CONCERN YET- EITHER PRACTICE ISSUE OR ENFORCEMENT ISSUE- WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS HAVE A CONVERSATION AND SEE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IN TERMS OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY BUSINESS MODELS. AND THE POTENTIAL OF BEING LISTED UNDER YOUR S. WELL OBVIOUSLY IT'S ATTRACTIVE TO OTHERS. OTHERS IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY AND I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT IT WOULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO SOME OF. THE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS THAT ARE REGULATED BY. YOUR BOARD SO I SUGGEST YOU DO TAKE A LOOK AT IT. BECAUSE SEPARATE AND APART FROM YOUR ACTIVITIES OF NFORCEMENT. AND OTHERWISE THEY'RE PROBABLY SOME VERY- THERE'S SOME AND- SIR TO INCORPORATE IS AND HAVE A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION WHILE THERE ARE OTHER. CERTAINLY OTHER MODELS THAT EXIST I ASSUME- FOR OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS BEYOND BEING A SOLE PROPRIETOR. THANK YOU FOR TAKING A LOOK AT THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO ASK ABOUT- IN IN GOING THROUGH THE BACKGROUND PAPER AND THE ISSUES THAT ARE COVERED IN THOSE- THAT WERE NOT THERE APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN SOME ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED DURING THE LAST SUNSET REVIEW. OF THERE WERE NOT RESPONDED TO OR IF THEY WERE- THEY WERE NOT RESPONDED TO- IN DEPTH LET ME JUST SAY THAT. QUESTIONS ABOUT UPDATES TO YOUR APPLICATION- AND CERTIFICATIONS BY APPLICANTS QUESTIONS OF NEAR AND DIS FROM NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART. THE DUPLICATIVE REQUIREMENTS AND MILITARY APPLICANTS- A KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT THERE WERE DUPLICATIVE REQUIREMENTS BUT NOT. MUCH IN THE WAY OF COMMENT ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO ABOUT IT. QUESTIONS ABOUT THE- WELL THE VARIOUS OTHERS WORKPLACE WORKFORCE TRENDS DEMOGRAPHICS DATA WHEN THE DATA WAS REQUESTED AND ALL OF THAT SO I GUESS JUST A COMMENT- MILLER WEEDS THE STAFF PUTS FORTH A LOT OF EFFORT IN. THESE BACKGROUND PAPERS IN THE SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS AND THEN THE ISSUES MANY ISSUES THAT THEY HAS TO BE ADDRESSED SO. APPS IN THE FUTURE WE COULD HAVE A MORE ROBUST- RESPONSIBILITY AND IN LOOKING AT IT IF YOU SEE HOLES IN THE RESPONSE THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY FILED PERHAPS YOU COULD SORT OF. FLUSH IT OUT FOR US THAT MAKES SENSE YES IT DOES IT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO ADDRESS ANY OF THOSE NOW THE MILITARY ONE OR- THE AUDITOR PAST ISSUES NOT NOT NECESSARILY I THINK MY COLLEAGUES WOULD PREFER THAT I MOVE ON BUT I WOULD LIKE. I WOULD LIKE IT AND APPRECIATED IF YOU WOULD SUBMIT THOSE THAT ADDITIONAL DATA TO THE STAFF OF BOTH COMMITTEES WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE. THANK YOU PERFECT. SENATOR PAN. FOLLOWED BY SENATOR ARCHULETA. THANK YOU AND- YEAH. OSTENTATION I DID NOT FOLLOW UP ON ISSUE ONE AND I KNOW THAT HE ANSWERED SOME QUESTIONS FROM SENATOR FROM. SELLER BERMAN- YOU KNOW IT THE R. A. BASICALLY I THINK THE MAIN ANSWER YOU GAVE WAS WELL WE'RE LOOKING AT INCREASING OUR FEES AGAIN AND CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE MANY OTHER OPTIONS BUT- AGAIN I DO WANT TO. POINT OUT AND I KNOW THE FASTEST OF OTHER BOARDS. YEAH WHAT'S THE IMPACT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S FEE INCREASES ON YOUR YOUR FINANCIALS- AND THEN WE'VE ALSO TALKED ABOUT SUCH ON THE DCA PROGRAM THE COST. GOING UP AS WELL. AND I WOULD MAKE NOTE AGAIN THAT- YOU KNOW THESE THESE FEE INCREASES OUR BURDENS ON THE ON THE ON THE PROFESSIONALS- PROVIDING SERVICES AND WILL CERTAINLY IN A SENSE THAT LICENSING FEE SHOULD. SUPPORT THE COST OF- OF THE LICENSING ACTIVITY- I THINK WE REALLY ALSO NEED TO SCRUTINIZE WHEN LICENSING BOARDS ARE BEING CHARGED BY OTHER AGENCIES ARE THOSE CHARGES IN LINE WITH THE ACTUAL COSTS OR THEY ACTUALLY END UP BEING FUND TRANSFERS. FROM FROM FROM BASICALLY LICENSEES TO SUPPORT OTHER AGENCIES. AND AGAIN I WOULD JUST MAKE NOTE I KEEP THAT RIGHT BUT IN REGARDS TO SOME OF THE DOJ COSTS THAT. NO WE'RE WE'RE PAYING WE CAN ACTUALLY LOOK UP FROM COLLEGE ARE WHAT THE SALARY IS OF DIFFERENT- PROFESSIONALS LAWYERS LEGAL YOU KNOW LEGAL AIDES AT CETERA. AND YET WE CALCULATE THE FEES AND YOU FIGURE OUT THE HOURLY RATE AND MATH. I MEAN THE ACTUAL CHARGES MANY FULL THAT NIGHT I REALIZE THERE MAY BE SOME ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS BUT THERE'S A THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE AND THAT IS ALL NOW BEING BORNE BY. THE LICENSEES AND WE'VE ALSO HEARD OF COURSE OTHER EXAMPLES WHERE- YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S A LAWSUIT OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS WHERE. IT'S NOT THE FAULT THE LICENSEE YET THE LICENSEES BEARING THE COST THE JUST BEING PASSED ON TO LICENSEES. SO I GUESS THE QUESTION AND MAYBE IT'S NOT SO MUCH A QUESTION YOU CAN ANSWER IS THAT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOUR STRUCTURAL DEFICIT- IS THAT WHAT. WHAT THE WHAT THE WHAT IS YOUR BOARD SEE IN TERMS OF THE ADDITIONAL BURDENS BEING PLACED JUST BECAUSE OF THESE YOU KNOW FEEDING THESE INCREASES THE CHARGES TO YOU. BY DOJ ARE R. D. C. A. AND ARE YOU LOOKING AT WAYS TO BETTER ME. YOU USED TO THOSE LEGAL SERVICES SO FORTH TRY TO REDUCE THE COST ON THE LICENSEES. AND TERMS OF MANAGING IT AND THEN CERTAINLY I THINK IT'S OUR ROLE TO PERHAPS ASKING QUESTIONS AND- SAY THAT IS THIS A REASONABLE CHARGE TO BE PASSED ON TO LICENSEES. YEAH I THINK I SHOULD ALSO MAY NOTICE IS THAT THERE'S A LICENSEE MYSELF AND ANOTHER BOARD. THAT YOU KNOW IT DID AT LEAST AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL- WHEN THEY PASSED IT. THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS PASSED THE TAX TAX CHANGES- YOU KNOW WE CAN NO LONGER DEDUCT LICENSING FEES AS PART OF OUR OUR IN INDIA. WHERE TAXIS AND NOW ALSO IN OUR OFFER INCOME TAX SO- IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE WORKING YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T DEDUCT AS EXPENSES ANYMORE SO THAT'S SORT OF ANOTHER PERSONAL FEEDING TREES. TO YOUR OWN PERSONAL FINANCES YOU PUT A REPAIR FOR YOUR LICENSE. SO SO AGAIN JUST HAVING THESE LICENSE FEES GO UP AND UP AND UP WITHOUT MORE RATIONALE THIS IS CERTAINLY VERY CONCERNING. SO PERHAPS- CAN YOU JUST MAYBE BRIEFLY TOUCH ON WHAT IS THE BOARD TRYING TO DO TERMS OF MANAGING THE- ROTATED DEGREE LET'S SAY THE DOJ COSTS AND TRYING TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF- SERVICES YOU NEED TO. USE YOUR YOU NEED TO USE SOME DOJ TO TRY TO MATCH THE DECREASE THE- IMPACT OF THOSE FEE INCREASES. IT SENATOR. ON IF I IF I MAY RESPOND TO THAT. IN TERMS OF THE DOJ. COST INCREASES- ONBOARD HAS LITTLE CONTROL OVER THAT WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT CERTAINLY- A COMMUNICATION UP FRONT AND A LITTLE BIT MORE IN ADVANCE I WOULD HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW BETTER FOR BOARD. OPERATIONS AS MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS HEARINGS WE DO HAVE A MECHANISM TO INCREASE. OUR REQUEST AN INCREASE IN- THOSE PARTICULAR LINE ITEMS IN SO FAR AS IF WE- ARE GETTING TO THE MAX. I'M IN TERMS OF MANAGING IT. THE BOARD REALLY DOES TAKE A CAREFUL LOOK AT- DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT. A VIOLATION REACHES THE LEVEL OF REQUIRING. THAT CASE BE REFERRED TO THE AG'S OFFICE OR IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE HANDED PENDULUM INDUSTRY. FOR EXAMPLE BY ISSUING A CITATION FINE- IN TERMS OF THE FEES- AND LOOKING AT. THIS THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS ABOARD ASSET- A SUB COMMITTEE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS ISSUE- THE BOARD DID VIEW. THE CURRENT APPLICATION AND RENEWAL FEES RELATIVE TO MANY OTHER HEALTH CARE. BOARDS AND CERTAINLY THIS BOARD IS CHARGING LOWER FEES. LOWER THAN MOST- ALSO EVEN IN TERMS OF- ASSOCIATION MEMBERSHIPS THAT THE BOARD'S LICENSING RENEWAL FEE AND APPLICATION FEES. ARE YOU KNOW ARE ALSO. LESS THE BOARD DOES RECOGNIZE THE BURDEN TO THE LICENSEES WHEN THERE IS ANY PROSPECTIVE APPLICANTS WHEN THERE ARE INCREASES IN THOSE FEES. WHICH IS WHY THE BOARD IS ALSO LOOKING AT A VARIETY OF FEES- THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE ADDRESSED FOR EXAMPLE INCREASING- AN APPLICATION FEE FROM FIFTY DOLLARS. TO SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR EXAMPLE- THAT MODEST INCREASE THOUGH. TO THE APPLICANTS WOULD HAVE A BEARING ON ALTERNATELY THE FEE NECESSARY TO BE INCREASED FOR THE RENEWAL FEE AN OPTION TO RENEW V. AS THE PRIMARY- REVENUE SOURCE. THE BOARD. DOES FEEL THAT WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB. MANAGING BUDGETS JUST- UNPLANNED- INCREASES AND IN THE BOARD EVERY WE DID PROVIDE. A TEN YEAR HISTORICAL INFORMATION DEMONSTRATING CONTINUED HER VERSION OF FUNDS SO I THINK THAT IT'S NOT SO MUCH- MAYBE A MANAGEMENT WE OBSCENE CLOSELY MANAGE AND MONITOR THE BOARD'S BUDGET. BUT IT SIMPLY HISTORICALLY- UNDER EARNING THE REVENUE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THOSE EXPENDITURES I HOPE THAT'S BEEN RESPONSIVE TO YOUR QUESTION. YES THANK YOU AND AGAIN I SAID WE ALSO HAVE OUR TASK HERE TOO BECAUSE SAID YOU'RE TOLD THESE FEES WE NEED TO BE ASKING QUESTIONS ACROSS THE BOARD ACROSS THE BOARDS. ABOUT WHY IS IT THAT- THEY'RE BEING CHARGED SO MUCH AND IS THAT REALLY THE ACTUAL COSTS TO THE DOJ FOR PROVIDING THE SERVICES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR PENCE CIRCULAR YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THE- OCULAR OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY ACT OBVIOUSLY- PERTAINS TO INVESTIGATION AND POTENTIAL FRAUD IN LOT OF ISSUES MY CONCERN IS ARE YOU FINDING THAT THERE'S PEOPLE THAT ARE OUTSIDE YOUR INDUSTRY WHO ARE PRACTICING IN THE INDUSTRY CAUSING AN ISSUE CONSUMER COMPLAINT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT ARE YOU- RECEIVING COMPLAINTS AND ARE YOU ACTING UPON. THANK YOU SENATOR ARCHULETA- ACTUALLY WORK WE ARE FORTUNATE WITH- LICENSURE- YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN AROUND TWENTY YEARS WHICH COMPARED TO MOST HEALTH CARE BOARD YOU KNOW IS A VERY LONG- WE ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH THOUGH THAT THE UNLICENSED PRACTICE BY INDIVIDUALS IS NOT REALLY AN ISSUE FOR THIS COURT- YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE QUITE FRANKLY. LICENSEES PRACTICING ON AN EXPIRED LICENSE IS A MORE COMMON- VIOLATION IF YOU WILL THAN OTHER INDIVIDUALS PRACTICING OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY WERE NOT AUTHORIZED TO DO SO. DOES DOES THAT ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION. YES IT DOES THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU SENATOR I SEE NO OTHER MONKS UP SO LET'S TURN TO TESTIMONY FROM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY. FIRST WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY.

AND ALTHOUGH IT'S EITHER CURRENTLYCOMMITTED HE SHOT SHAREHOLDERS UNDER. PHYSICAL THERAPY CORPORATIONS THEY CAN'T AT THAT. AND WE BELIEVE IT'S A NON CONTROVERSIAL CHANGE AND YOU'RE NOT AWARE OF.

FOR HER LAST. GRAND FORTY YEARS AGO WE HAD DINNER FIVE GOALS ENHANCE SERVICES FOR A. VARIETY OF OUR STATE. WE ARE HAPPY TO REPORT THAT THE FEW YEARS EACH THROUGH THE EVENT IN. SAID IS PRESENT OUR OPPORTUNITIES ALMOST ALL THE P. T. M. B. T. EIGHT PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS PRESENTATIONS THE LICENSEE. ANOTHER GOAL MET FROM RESTAURANTS TO DO PLANT WAS IMPROVING SERVICE TO APPLICANTS BE ENDORSEMENTS FOR EDUCATED PHYSICAL THERAPIST AND MILITARY PERSONNEL AS WELL AS THEIR SPOUSES. WE NOW HAVE DEDICATED STAFF AND PROCEDURES FOR PROCESSING THESE APPLICATIONS MORE EFFICIENT EFFICIENTLY AND I'D LIKE TO HAND IT OVER TO OUR EMAIL. LIST HIGHS. BUT ACTUALLY REMEMBERS- ESTIMATE OF THIS PROGRAM ON THE STOCK BOARD I JUST LIKE TO THINK WE ARE TO STAMP THIS REVIEW- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND TO BE RESPECTED BUT MAYBE SOMTIME WE'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SIR. CALLINGS QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS MISTER RICHARD BERMAN IF HE HAS ANY. MIKE THANK YOU GERMAN ROTH BRIDGET THANK YOU FOR THE- THE VERY GOOD AND CONCISE PRESENTATIONS JUST A QUICK QUESTION I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A DESIRE TO INCREASE THE- STATUTORY CAPS SO THAT WHEN NECESSARY- YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO INCREASE FEES IN TERMS OF THE BOARD'S REQUESTS- WHAT STEPS WITH THE BOARD TAKE WHEN INCREASING FEES AND REGULATIONS AND WHAT WITH THE AUDIT AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT LOOK LIKE. WERE THAT TO HAPPEN. YES WE DO- WE INTEND TO BE PROACTIVE WHEN WE CAN'T AND SO I'M GONNA LET YOU. EXECUTIVE VICE OFFICER KAISER INTO THAT QUESTION. SHE JUST BE VERY CLEAR. WORDS NOT- ASKING WE NEED TO SECURE THE INCREASE THIS TIME AS GERMAN BIRMINGHAM STATED WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS INCREASE THE STATUTORY CAPS JUST IN. THE EVENT THAT THERE ARE ANY KIND OF UNFORESEEN EXPENDITURES THAT MIGHT HAPPEN JUST REPAIRING FOR. THE WORST OF ALL OUTCOMES SO- JUST FEATURE PROCESS BALANCE ELSON WAS JUST BY THE REGULATIONS FOR PROM DATES YOU WOULD GO THROUGH A VERY LENGTHY PROCESS- DOES STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK. OUR LICENSEES ARE PROFESSIONALS ASSOCIATION IN THE CONSUMERS WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND FEEDBACK NOT PROCESS. PRIOR TO THAT WE HAVE TO DO IS JUST. WHAT THE INCREASE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE YOU KNOW GIVEN THE BOARD'S FINANCIAL SITUATION- AGAIN. LOOKING AT FINALLY THIS STATES TODAY. I'M USING CONCERNED ESTIMATE WE DO SEE. AN INCREASE IN EXPENDITURE OUT. LINING IN REVENUE OUR PROJECT- INSOLVENCY RATE FOR FISCAL YEARS FROM NOW- AND SO THAT THAT STATUTORY CAP IS IMPORTANT TO US BECAUSE WE WOULD LIKE. TO BE AS FAR OFF AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU AND I GUESS. ONE MORE QUESTION ARE REALLY JUST AN OPENING TO LET YOU YOU KNOW DISCUSS IT IF YOU LIKE BUT- I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A LIMITATION ON. HOW OFTEN A PATIENT CAN SEE THE PHYSICAL THERAPIST BEFORE POSITION NEEDS TO PHYSICALLY EXAMINE THE PATIENT. AND SIGN OFF ON CONTINUE TREATMENT I KNOW THAT THIS WAS WAVE DURING THE PANDEMIC- AND THAT THERE IS A DESIRE TO SEE THAT MADE PERMANENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT ISSUE. YES SO- THAT WAIVER ALLOWED FOR A TELEHEALTH VISIT WOULD POSITION. AND THE PATIENCE OF A FACE TO FACE VISIT AND WE DO FEEL LIKE THAT SHOULD CONTINUE INDEFINITELY SO OVER THE PANDEMIC THE MODEL WORKS VERY WELL WITH PHYSICAL THERAPIST STILL REFERRING PATIENTS BACK TO THEIR DOCTORS THE STUFF FACE TO FACE VISITS. WHEN THAT WAS NECESSARY WITH THE PRACTITIONER FELT LIKE THE PATIENT DID NEED TO SEE THEIR DOCTOR BUT IN ORDER JUST TO CONTINUE THE SERVICES AND YOU A DELAY IN SERVICES I THINK THAT I'M CONTINUING THIS TELEHEALTH IS IT COULD BE VERY. BENEFICIAL TO PATIENT CARE. YOU CAN ADD. YOU KNOW THE ONLY THING I WOULD ASK THAT IF SOMEONE OR JUST A MODERNIZATION APPROACH RIGHT SO WHEN THOSE STATUTES WRITTEN- TELEMEDICINE WAS IN ITS INFANCY AND NOW I THINK WITH OUR EXPERIENCES STRUGGLE ACADEMICALLY REALIZED THEY CAN WORK VERY WELL- AND WE WOULD STILL BE RELYING ON SPECIAL BOTH PRACTITIONERS IN THE MATTER AND WHETHER OR NOT IT'S APPROPRIATE BUT I THINK JUST REMOVING THE WORDS IN PERSON FROM THAT PARTICULAR. STATUTE WILL SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS. THE YOU. RICHARD BERMAN- LET ME JUST ASK A QUICK QUESTION BEFORE I MOVED TO SENATOR ARCH ALETTA. YEAH I'M LOOKING AT THE BACKGROUND PAPER AND THEN I THINK- SURE BERMAN WAS REFERENCING THIS WHEN HE ASKED HIS QUESTION ABOUT THE STATUTORY CAP BUT THE- BACKGROUND PAPER TALKS ABOUT A DIMINISHING FINE CONDITIONS STARTING IN. FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND CONTINUING EACH FISCAL YEAR WITH THE PROJECTED INSOLVENCY. OCCURRING IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX WELL WE'RE IN. PLANNING FOR FISCAL pTWENTY THREE RIGHT NOW IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT FAR OFF I HAVEN'T. I HEARD A PLAN IS THERE A PLAN OR IS THE PLAN JUST INCREASE THE STATUTORY CAP AND WE'LL FIGURE THIS OUT LATER. I'LL TAKE THAT QUESTION- THANK YOU FOR ASKING IT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S JUST AN OPPORTUNITY TO KIND OF EXPRESS AGAIN THAT CONCERN- THIS WAR IS BEEN VERY PHYSICALLY RESPONSIBLE. ROBERT AND ANNA CAN PRIOR I'M VERY MINDFUL OF MONIES THAT WE START OF OUR LICENSEES- YES CONTINUE TO RISE AND THIS WORD ESPECIALLY CONTINUES TO GROW AS THE PRESSURE GROWS THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A GROWING PAIN IN THE SENSE THAT WE ARE STILL TRYING TO CATCH UP BASH- AS AN EXAMPLE THE NUMBER OF PTA PROGRAMS HAS INCREASED SINCE OUR LAST ANSWER SIXTEEN PROGRAMS NOW TWENTY TWO- AND WITH THAT COMES AN INCREASE IN APPLICATIONS RECEIVED THE LICENSES ISSUED AND SO ON- WE DO IT WE CAN'T CONTROL COSTS INSIDE. REALLY REALLY- GOOD JOB CONSIDERING WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A HELP ME FIND THE DISHES ARE LAST FEW GREASE- WE PUT MONEY AWAY FOR A MOVE TO A LARGER SWEET- ALL WHILE. ALSO REGARDING MY RESPECT FOR FUN. I'M I WILL SAY THE FUND ISSUE- FOR EXPENDITURES SOMETHING WE CAN RUN ON THEIR TRAIN THAT ARE IN. YOU KNOW THROUGH ECONOMICS AND SAY. OUR COSTS ARE GOING TO GO UP ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT FIGHT. AGAIN PERCENTAGE. OUR PROJECTIONS ARE REVENUES ARE VERY CONSERVATIVE IN THE SENSE THEIR BASELINE FROM ACTUAL REAL NUMBERS- AND WHILE I KNOW THAT OUR LICENSE VIOLATION IS GROWING ACTUALLY. SOME INCREASE IN OUR REVENUES RECEIVED A GENERALIZED. RIGHT FROM- VERY TRUE JENNIFER STARTED I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BOUNCING. THE SPORTS BUT SHE'S THE BEST PART. WHAT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ATTEMPTING TO MANAGE YOUR FINANCES THE BOARD'S FINANCES. AS WELL AS YOU HAVE AND CAN DO THE FOLKS IN THE HORSE YOU HAVE HEARD ME SAY THIS BEFORE I'M NOT SURE. THAT IT'S TOTALLY APPROPRIATE TO FOIST THE ENTIRE COST OF GOVERNMENT. ON THOSE WHO ARE LICENSED IN OCCUPATIONS AND PROFESSIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I THINK THERE'S A PLACE FOR. LICENSEES TO PAY FOR A CERTAIN PORTION OF THE COST OF GOVERNMENT THAT ARE DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTED. TO THEIR ACTIVITIES IS LICENSEES BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT. THAT THE ENTIRE COST FOR EXAMPLE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS SHOULD BE FUNDED BY. THOSE WHO AR LICENSED IN PROFESSIONS AND OCCUPATIONS IN CALIFORNIA I MAY BE ONE VOICE OUT OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE BUT- THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS. TODAY I GET TO CURE THIS THE COMMITTEE AND I GET TO EXPRESS THAT OPINION I THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR PLAN I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU AVOID- FINANCIAL INSOLVENCY BECAUSE- IF YOUR DOG WILL YOU'LL JUST. JOIN THE LONG. STORY LINE OF BOARDS. BUREAUS AND COMMITTEES THAT ARE FARTHER FACING FINANCIAL INSOLVENCY OR THAT ARE ALREADY HERE THERE AND I JUST ASSUME THAT IT TO THE LIST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SEARCH A LOT OF. THANK YOU MR CHAIR. OF MY QUESTION PERTAINS TO OUR MILITARY VETERANS. WHO HAVE SERVED OUR GREAT COUNTRY AND WHO HAVE- OBTAIN KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL. ESPECIALLY OUR MEDICS AS YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD. VETERANS WHO HAVE- COME INTO THE CIVILIAN WORLD- WITH EXPERTISE AND I WILL POINT OUT. THAT WITH THE NUMBER OF INJURIES WE'VE HAD IN AFGHANISTAN IRAQ OVER THE YEARS. THESE EXPERTS WHO HAVE THE- MILITARY OCCUPATIONAL SPECIALTIES TO HANDLE. AND WORK WITH PATIENTS ESPECIALLY. WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING THEM. STRONGER AND UP TO- THE ABILITY TO WALK AGAIN AND PHYSICAL THERAPY. IS THEIR EXPERTISE. HAVE YOU DECIDED AND IF YOU LOOKED INTO OPENING UP YOUR- GET INDUSTRY TO THESE VETERANS AND- AND GETTING THEM- INVOLVED IN A PATHWAY. TO BE CERTIFIED AND LICENSED IN SHOW ON. TO JOIN YOUR RANKS WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. AS I MENTIONED A LITTLE EARLIER WE DO HAVE A STAFF MEMBER. BASICALLY ASSIGNED TO MILITARY APPLICATIONS AND PROCESSING THOSE- MILITARY MEMBERS AS WELL AS THEIR SPOUSE AND ALL THAT MR PAGER ANSWERS THE QUESTION ABOUT GETTING THEM MORE INVOLVED. YES THANK YOU SENATOR OURS WERE QUESTION- WE FEEL ABOUT OUR VETERANS VERY MUCH SAME WAY YOU DO- AND LUCKILY FOR US THE MILITARY DOES- REQUIRE THE SAME MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS THAT WE NEED CALIFORNIA STATE LICENSURE SO IT'S VERY EASY FOR MILITARY VETERANS TO. THE CALIFORNIA TO PRACTICE YOUR POST RETIREMENT OR DISCHARGE- AND AS- DOCTOR MEETING AND STATED WE HAVE DOESN'T EVEN STAFF WHEN I SAY DOESN'T IT STOP I WANT TO LEAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT. WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO WHAT OUR MISSION IS TO PROVIDE CONCIERGE LEVEL SERVICES TO OUR MILITARY VETERANS AND THEIR SPOUSES I MEAN YOU JUST STEPPED OUT FOR YOU- THAT THE APPLICATION PROCESS CAN BE QUITE COMPLEX.
