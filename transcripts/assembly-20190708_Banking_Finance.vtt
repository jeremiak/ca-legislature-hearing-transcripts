GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE -- WHOSE

FINANCIAL HEALTH IS VERY FRAGILE.

01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:16.639
EVEN SMALL CHANGES CAN HAVE A

01:11:16.705 --> 01:11:19.174
LARGE IMPACT ON THEIR SITUATION.

01:11:19.241 --> 01:11:21.443

01:11:23.078 --> 01:11:24.747
CHANGES THAT WE MAKE AND HOW

01:11:24.813 --> 01:11:25.280
THIS CAN AFFECT PEOPLE.

01:11:25.347 --> 01:11:27.216
OF THIS I'M GONNA GO OVER MY

01:11:27.282 --> 01:11:30.919
COMMENTS AND THESE ARE FROM THE

01:11:30.986 --> 01:11:31.553
VERSION OF THE BILL THAT WE HAD

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:34.623
SEEN ON TUESDAY -- SIR FIRST I'D

01:11:34.690 --> 01:11:35.224
LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT

01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:36.158
OVERALL I THINK THE BILL'S VERY

01:11:36.225 --> 01:11:38.027
POSITIVE FOR CONSUMERS -- WE

01:11:38.093 --> 01:11:39.094
APPRECIATE THAT THE BILL

01:11:39.161 --> 01:11:40.562
RECOGNIZES THAT THE MONEY THAT

01:11:40.629 --> 01:11:41.697
SOMEBODY HAS ARMED IS ACTUALLY

01:11:41.764 --> 01:11:43.632
THERE'S AND ACCESSING IT IS NOT

01:11:43.699 --> 01:11:46.168
ALONE -- WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE

01:11:46.235 --> 01:11:48.103
BILL RECOGNIZES THE DIRECT TO

01:11:48.170 --> 01:11:49.438
CONSUMER MODEL THAT'S HOW WE GET

01:11:49.505 --> 01:11:50.472
OUT THAT'S HOW PEOPLE WORK FOR

01:11:50.539 --> 01:11:51.707
SMALL BUSINESSES.

01:11:51.774 --> 01:11:53.008
AND EVEN GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES

01:11:53.075 --> 01:11:54.410
CAN GET ACCESS TO ITS WAS VERY

01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:56.445
INCLUSIVE IN THAT WAY -- THERE'S

01:11:56.512 --> 01:11:57.379
A NUMBER OF THE THINGS I LIKE

01:11:57.446 --> 01:12:00.149
WITH THE BILL BUT I WILL NOT

01:12:00.215 --> 01:12:03.152
LIST EACH ONE OF THOSE -- WE

01:12:03.218 --> 01:12:04.086
WOULD BE REMISS OF US NOT TO

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:06.055
ADDRESS THE AREAS WHERE WE THINK

01:12:06.121 --> 01:12:07.423
THERE COULD BE SOME CONSUMER ARM.

01:12:07.489 --> 01:12:08.323
AND I HAVE -- WE HAVE THREE

01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:11.460
AREAS OF CONCERN.

01:12:11.527 --> 01:12:13.429
THE FIRST ONE IS WITH THE WHOLE

01:12:13.495 --> 01:12:17.132
BACK OF 50% OF WE BELIEVE THAT

01:12:17.199 --> 01:12:18.434
IT WILL MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:19.535
PEOPLE TO MAKE OF THE RENT

01:12:19.601 --> 01:12:22.938
PAYMENTS -- THIS MONTH AS MANY

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:24.973
PEOPLE GOT PAID AFTER THE RENT

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:26.608
DUE DATE HAS GOT PAID BEFORE

01:12:26.675 --> 01:12:27.076
THEIR AND YOUR DATE.

01:12:27.142 --> 01:12:28.911
I'M AND THAT'S PRETTY CONSISTENT

01:12:28.977 --> 01:12:29.978
ACROSS MONTHS AS TO WHAT YOU'D

01:12:30.045 --> 01:12:31.380
EXPECT IS THAT ABOUT SIX TIMES A

01:12:31.447 --> 01:12:32.314
YEAR.

01:12:32.381 --> 01:12:34.216
PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY RENT

01:12:34.283 --> 01:12:36.585
BEFORE THEIR PAYDAY -- AND THE

01:12:36.652 --> 01:12:38.020
CONSTRAINTS WILL ACTUALLY MAKE

01:12:38.087 --> 01:12:40.889
IT TOUGH FOR THEM TO MAKE THEIR

01:12:40.956 --> 01:12:41.490
OWN PAYMENTS -- RIGHT THROUGH

01:12:41.557 --> 01:12:43.459
THE YEAR.

01:12:43.525 --> 01:12:44.560
THE SECOND CONCERN IS ON THE

01:12:44.626 --> 01:12:47.463
FIXED MONTHLY FEE -- THE CONCERN

01:12:47.529 --> 01:12:48.564
IS THAT BY FIXING THE MONTHLY

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:50.599
FEE IT COULD CONSTRAIN THE

01:12:50.666 --> 01:12:52.167
AVAILABILITY OF THE PRODUCT.

01:12:52.234 --> 01:12:53.168
OR COULD AFFECT THE QUALITY OF

01:12:53.235 --> 01:12:54.403
THE PRODUCT IS LIKE TELLING A

01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:55.871
GROCERY STORE THAT YOU CAN ONLY

01:12:55.938 --> 01:12:56.805
JUDGE PEOPLE FIXED AMOUNT PER

01:12:56.872 --> 01:12:57.606
MONTH.

01:12:57.673 --> 01:12:59.074
THE GROCERY STORES LIKELY EITHER

01:12:59.141 --> 01:13:00.008
CUT BACK HOW MUCH THEY LET YOU

01:13:00.075 --> 01:13:00.642
BUY.

01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:02.377
OR GIVE YOU WORST QUALITY

01:13:02.444 --> 01:13:03.278
PRODUCE.

01:13:03.345 --> 01:13:04.880
AND IN TERMS OF THIS PRODUCT

01:13:04.947 --> 01:13:05.414
LIKE MONEY TO SEND QUALITY

01:13:05.481 --> 01:13:06.348
WHATEVER COMES FROM.

01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:07.382
BUT THE WAY YOU CAN ACT TO

01:13:07.449 --> 01:13:08.751
CHANGE THE QUALITIES BY EITHER

01:13:08.817 --> 01:13:12.221
BY CUTTING BACK ON THE SPEED ARE

01:13:12.287 --> 01:13:15.057
CUTTING BACK ON THE SUPPORT --

01:13:15.124 --> 01:13:16.825
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU RESTRICT

01:13:16.892 --> 01:13:18.193
THE AVAILABILITY OF A GOOD

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:20.095
PRODUCT A SITUATION LIKE THIS IS

01:13:20.162 --> 01:13:21.430
PEOPLE GO TO THE BAD PRODUCTS?

01:13:21.497 --> 01:13:23.398
THE BAD PRODUCTS OVERDRAFT FEES

01:13:23.465 --> 01:13:24.366
WHICH I THIRTY FIVE BUCKS A

01:13:24.433 --> 01:13:26.101
TRANSACTION -- THE CFPB STUDY

01:13:26.168 --> 01:13:27.136
SAID THAT THE AVERAGE

01:13:27.202 --> 01:13:28.370
TRANSACTION IS ABOUT FIFTY BUCKS

01:13:28.437 --> 01:13:29.872
SO IT'S ABOUT THIRTY FIVE

01:13:29.938 --> 01:13:31.740
DOLLARS OF FEES FOR FIFTY DOLLAR --

01:13:31.807 --> 01:13:33.876
USAGE AND THE OTHER BUT

01:13:33.942 --> 01:13:35.711
ALTERNATIVE IT IS -- PAYDAY

01:13:35.778 --> 01:13:37.045
LOANS THE CPP STUDY SO THAT'S

01:13:37.112 --> 01:13:39.014
ABOUT FOURTEEN DOLLARS FOUR

01:13:39.081 --> 01:13:39.882
HUNDRED DOLLARS ACCESS.

01:13:39.948 --> 01:13:41.150
SO IT'S ABOUT FIFTY DOLLARS THE

01:13:41.216 --> 01:13:45.320
TRANSACTION.

01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:46.855
ON THE PAYDAY LOANS.

01:13:46.922 --> 01:13:47.790
SO MY CONCERN OUT THERE IS THAT

01:13:47.856 --> 01:13:48.791
IF WE RESTRICT ABILITY OF THIS

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:49.591
PRODUCT.

01:13:49.658 --> 01:13:50.759
IT WILL FORCE PEOPLE INTO

01:13:50.826 --> 01:13:52.060
OVERDRAFT FEES AND PAY LOANS.

01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:52.761
AND OUR ANALYSIS ACTUALLY

01:13:52.828 --> 01:13:53.562
ESTIMATES THAT THE LIKELY

01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:56.031
ADDITIONAL FEES BY PEOPLE NOT

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:57.099
HAVING ACCESS TO THIS PRODUCT

01:13:57.166 --> 01:13:58.467
WE'RE GOING THE OTHER PRODUCTS.

01:13:58.534 --> 01:14:00.068
IS BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:14:00.135 --> 01:14:02.771
TWENTY TWO DOLLARS PER MONTH.

01:14:02.838 --> 01:14:04.873
THE THIRD CONCERN IS ON THE TWO

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:08.310
DAY NOTICE REQUIREMENT PRIOR TO

01:14:08.377 --> 01:14:08.977
A DEBIT.

01:14:09.044 --> 01:14:11.013
THAT NOTICE -- PETER IS FINE IF

01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:11.613
THE TRANSACTION HAPPENS MORE

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.048
THAN TWO DAYS.

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:15.117
BEFORE THE DOUBLE DATE -- BUT IF

01:14:15.184 --> 01:14:17.419
SOMEONE IS MY THE DAY BEFORE

01:14:17.486 --> 01:14:18.620
PAYDAY.

01:14:18.687 --> 01:14:19.221
I WOULD STOP TO GIVE THEM TWO

01:14:19.288 --> 01:14:20.055
DAYS NOTICE.

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:20.956
CAUSED YOU TO KNOW TWO DAYS

01:14:21.023 --> 01:14:22.057
BEFORE THEY WILL USE THE PRODUCT

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:23.926
AND HAVING ACCESS TO THEIR PAY

01:14:23.992 --> 01:14:24.660
THE DAY BEFORE PAYDAY IS

01:14:24.726 --> 01:14:26.161
ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT.

01:14:26.228 --> 01:14:27.729
THAT IS THE DAY WHEN THE BAG

01:14:27.796 --> 01:14:29.731
BOUNCES THE LOWEST -- AND IN A

01:14:29.798 --> 01:14:31.166
LETTER WE'VE SHOWN THAT PEOPLE

01:14:31.233 --> 01:14:35.871
USE OUR PRODUCT TO BUY GAS.

01:14:35.938 --> 01:14:37.005
WE'VE SEEN THAT THE HOURS WORKED

01:14:37.072 --> 01:14:38.073
PER WEEK GOES UP WITH ALMOST US

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.041
USING A PRODUCT.

01:14:39.107 --> 01:14:40.075
PREVIOUSLY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:40.943
THEY WOULD MISS WORK BECAUSE

01:14:41.009 --> 01:14:42.744
THEY COULD NOT BUY GAS TO GET TO

01:14:42.811 --> 01:14:43.345
WORK.

01:14:43.412 --> 01:14:44.513
WANT TO HAVE A PRODUCT THEY BUY

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:46.181
GAS TO GET TO WORK THE HOURS

01:14:46.248 --> 01:14:48.884
THAT THEY WORK UP A WEEK GOES UP.

01:14:48.951 --> 01:14:50.419
AND THE WAGES GO UP AS WELL --

01:14:50.485 --> 01:14:51.520
AND SO WE'D LIKE PEOPLE TO BE

01:14:51.587 --> 01:14:53.388
ABLE TO USE THE PRODUCT EVEN THE

01:14:53.455 --> 01:14:56.024
DAY BEFORE PAYDAY -- DE FIX FOR

01:14:56.091 --> 01:14:58.260
THAT SEEMS PRETTY SIMPLE IS IF

01:14:58.327 --> 01:14:58.861
YOU DO A TRANSACTION MORE THAN

01:14:58.927 --> 01:14:59.995
TWO DAYS BEFORE THEN YOU WE WILL

01:15:00.062 --> 01:15:00.729
PROVIDE TO HIS NOTICE.

01:15:00.796 --> 01:15:02.264
IF YOU DO A TRANSACTION WITHIN

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:03.298
THE LAST TWO DAYS WE COULD

01:15:03.365 --> 01:15:06.635
PROVIDE DOORS AS SOON AS THEY DO

01:15:06.702 --> 01:15:10.105
THE TRANSACTION.

01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:11.840
SO I LIKE TO ANYBODY TRADING

01:15:11.907 --> 01:15:12.608
THAT.

01:15:12.674 --> 01:15:15.310
pPOSITIVE -- THERE'S A I THINK IF

01:15:15.377 --> 01:15:16.545
YOU SPECIFIC OPTIONS THAT COULD

01:15:16.612 --> 01:15:18.881
ACTUALLY MAKE THIS BILL EVEN

01:15:18.947 --> 01:15:19.114
BETTER.

01:15:19.181 --> 01:15:22.985
THANK YOU.

01:15:23.051 --> 01:15:25.454
THANKS FOR THAT -- SO MY NAME IS

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.122
JASON LEE AND ON THE C. E. O. OF

01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:29.691
DAILY PAY. ONE OF THE INDUSTRY

01:15:29.758 --> 01:15:30.726
LEADERS IN THIS EMERGING

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:32.961
CATEGORY.

01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:34.696
SO THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED.

01:15:34.763 --> 01:15:36.798
SUBJECT AREA -- AND IT'S ONE

01:15:36.865 --> 01:15:39.067
THAT REQUIRES PRECISION IN THE

01:15:39.134 --> 01:15:40.235
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS TO GET

01:15:40.302 --> 01:15:42.271
COMPLETELY RIGHT.

01:15:42.337 --> 01:15:43.572
SO ALL OF OUR COLLECTIVE NORTH

01:15:43.639 --> 01:15:45.641
STARS ARE TO SUPPORT A NEW

01:15:45.707 --> 01:15:49.311
INDUSTRY -- AND THAT INDUSTRY IS

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:50.846
MEANT TO PROTECT WORKERS AND

01:15:50.913 --> 01:15:52.547
GIVE THEM WHAT THEY NEED WHILE

01:15:52.614 --> 01:15:53.715
AT THE SAME TIME.

01:15:53.782 --> 01:15:55.450
NOT UNINTENTIONALLY OPENING THE

01:15:55.517 --> 01:15:57.419
DOOR FOR PAYDAY LENDERS TO TAKE

01:15:57.486 --> 01:16:00.555
ADVANTAGE OF NEW LEGISLATION. TO

01:16:00.622 --> 01:16:02.991
THAT END THE CURRENT VERSION OF

01:16:03.058 --> 01:16:05.827
THE BILL IS CLOSER.

01:16:05.894 --> 01:16:07.262
THEN WHERE WE WERE A FEW MONTHS

01:16:07.329 --> 01:16:08.797
BACK BUT THERE ARE STILL SOME

01:16:08.864 --> 01:16:10.132
REMAINING ISSUES.

01:16:10.198 --> 01:16:11.400
ALLOW ME TO HIGHLIGHT ONE OF

01:16:11.466 --> 01:16:13.068
THEM HERE.

01:16:13.135 --> 01:16:15.070
SINCE I THOUGHT THAT THERE IS

01:16:15.137 --> 01:16:17.072
ONLY A TWO MINUTE LIMITATION AB.

01:16:17.139 --> 01:16:18.607
SO AS DRAFTED.

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:20.876
THE BILL LIMITS THE WORKER TO BE

01:16:20.943 --> 01:16:23.779
ONLY ABLE TO ACCESS 50% OF HER

01:16:23.845 --> 01:16:25.614
OWN MONEY.

01:16:25.681 --> 01:16:27.849
SO WE AS A COMPANY AS WELL AS

01:16:27.916 --> 01:16:29.618
YOUR CONSTITUENTS FIND THIS

01:16:29.685 --> 01:16:31.119
LIMITATION ARBITRARY -- AND

01:16:31.186 --> 01:16:32.955
LIKELY PUSHES THEM TO CONTINUE

01:16:33.021 --> 01:16:35.457
TO USE PAYDAY LOANS. FOR WHAT

01:16:35.524 --> 01:16:36.858
IT'S WORTH WE'VE COLLECTED NINE

01:16:36.925 --> 01:16:38.527
HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO RESPONSES

01:16:38.593 --> 01:16:39.461
FROM CONSTITUENTS.

01:16:39.528 --> 01:16:40.495
IN EACH OF YOUR DISTRICTS IN THE

01:16:40.562 --> 01:16:41.663
LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS REGARDING

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:42.931
THIS BILL.

01:16:42.998 --> 01:16:43.999
AND THEY HAVE SAID QUOTE.

01:16:44.066 --> 01:16:45.467
IT'S MY MONEY.

01:16:45.534 --> 01:16:47.602
I BURNED IT.

01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:48.804
I NEED THIS MONEY TO PAY MY OWN

01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:51.406
BILLS.

01:16:51.473 --> 01:16:52.975
NOW WE UNDERSTAND THE OBJECTIVE

01:16:53.041 --> 01:16:55.410
HERE IS TO PROTECT A SMALL

01:16:55.477 --> 01:16:57.212
MINORITY OF WORKERS FROM QUOTE

01:16:57.279 --> 01:17:00.415
HAVING NOTHING LEFT ON PAYDAY.

01:17:00.482 --> 01:17:01.416
IN THE FOUR YEARS OF OFFERING

01:17:01.483 --> 01:17:02.818
THIS SERVICE ACROSS OVER TEN

01:17:02.884 --> 01:17:04.186
MILLION PAYMENTS I HAVE NEVER

01:17:04.252 --> 01:17:06.655
ONCE.

01:17:06.722 --> 01:17:07.956
SEEN A WORKER WIND UP WITH

01:17:08.023 --> 01:17:09.825
NOTHING ON PAYDAY.

01:17:09.891 --> 01:17:10.959
HOWEVER.

01:17:11.026 --> 01:17:12.494
THERE ARE SEVERAL INSTANCES

01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:15.163
WHERE A WORKER MAY NEED. 55%

01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:17.399
EACH WEEK.

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:19.267
NOW WITHOUT THAT ACCESS TO THAT

01:17:19.334 --> 01:17:19.968
AMOUNT.

01:17:20.035 --> 01:17:22.270
THAT WORKER MAY LIKELY BE FORCED

01:17:22.337 --> 01:17:24.573
TO GO TO A PAYDAY LENDER.

01:17:24.639 --> 01:17:26.141
NOW WE'VE SUGGESTED A MORE

01:17:26.208 --> 01:17:28.577
ELEGANT WAY. TO SATISFY BOTH

01:17:28.643 --> 01:17:30.212
YOUR CONSTITUENTS AS WELL AS A

01:17:30.278 --> 01:17:31.380
SENATORS CONCERN.

01:17:31.446 --> 01:17:32.714
AND THAT IS SIMPLY TO ALLOW THE

01:17:32.781 --> 01:17:35.050
WORKER FULL ACCESS TO OUR OWN

01:17:35.117 --> 01:17:36.218
MONEY.

01:19:29.965 --> 01:19:31.099
OVERARCHING CONCERN THAT AS THE

01:19:31.166 --> 01:19:32.501
LEGISLATURE DECIDES TO RECOGNIZE

01:19:32.567 --> 01:19:33.502
AN EMERGING MARKET THERE IS

01:19:33.568 --> 01:19:35.170
APPROPRIATE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT

01:19:35.237 --> 01:19:36.171

IS IN THE BILL AS WELL BUT WE

01:19:42.144 --> 01:19:43.411
WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH.

01:19:43.478 --> 01:19:46.214
AND MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS

01:19:46.281 --> 01:19:46.815
PROTECTIVE OF CONSUMERS THANK

LABOR FEDERATION WERE ALSO

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:53.655
NEUTRAL ON THE BILL AND ALSO

01:19:54.656 --> 01:19:55.624
APPRECIATION OF THE AUTHORS

OFFICE NO ONE ELSE THE TO WORK

01:19:56.658 --> 01:19:58.293
SO HARD TO TRY.

01:19:58.360 --> 01:19:58.927
TO GET THE LANGUAGE RIGHT WERE

01:19:58.994 --> 01:20:00.362
EVERYONE NEEDS THAT DOES SEEM

01:20:00.428 --> 01:20:01.863

FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE VERY

MUCH APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK

01:20:04.032 --> 01:20:05.100
PROTECTION LANGUAGE THAT'S IN

01:20:05.167 --> 01:20:06.301
THERE AND THINK THAT MAKES IT A

01:20:06.368 --> 01:20:08.770
MUCH STRONGER BILL -- ART TO

01:20:08.837 --> 01:20:09.905
REMAINING CONCERNS HAVE TO DO

01:20:09.971 --> 01:20:11.673
WITH WORKER PRIVACY -- THE

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:13.508
PROPOSED LANGUAGE DOES ADDRESS

01:20:13.575 --> 01:20:14.910
THE ISSUE OF WORKERS PERSONALLY

01:20:14.976 --> 01:20:16.645
IDENTIFIABLE DATA PARTICULARLY

01:20:16.711 --> 01:20:17.746
FINANCIAL DATA.

01:20:17.812 --> 01:20:19.214
ALSO GEOLOCATION DATA THINGS

01:20:19.281 --> 01:20:21.082
LIKE THAT FROM BEING SOLD OFF TO

01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:22.617
THIRD PARTIES BUT WE'RE KIND OF

01:20:22.684 --> 01:20:23.985
NEW TO THIS ARIENS ARE STILL

01:20:24.052 --> 01:20:25.053
REVIEWING THE LANGUAGE TO MAKE

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:27.055
SURE THAT -- THE INTENT IS

01:20:27.122 --> 01:20:27.956
ACHIEVED BY THE WAY THAT IT'S

01:20:28.023 --> 01:20:29.191
WRITTEN BUT THAT LOOKS PRETTY

01:20:29.257 --> 01:20:30.492
GOOD RIGHT NOW AND THEN THE

01:20:30.559 --> 01:20:31.626
OTHER CONCERN WAS TO MAKE SURE

01:20:31.693 --> 01:20:32.928
THAT -- THERE'S LANGUAGE IN

01:20:32.994 --> 01:20:34.496
THERE THAT HELPS PROTECT.

01:20:34.563 --> 01:20:36.064
A WORKERS.

01:20:36.131 --> 01:20:37.632
EXPOSURE TO THE SERVICE AND THE

01:20:37.699 --> 01:20:38.667
NUMBER OF TIMES THEY'VE ACCESS

01:20:38.733 --> 01:20:39.701
THE SERVICE FROM BEING

01:20:39.768 --> 01:20:41.269
TRANSFERRED OVER TO THE EMPLOYER

01:20:41.336 --> 01:20:42.771
TO THE EXTENT THAT'S POSSIBLE

01:20:42.837 --> 01:20:44.539
THE SAME WAY THAT -- SOMEONE

01:20:44.606 --> 01:20:45.740
WOULD WANT THEIR PLAYER TO KNOW

01:20:45.807 --> 01:20:46.775
THAT THEY WERE TAKING ADVANTAGE

01:20:46.841 --> 01:20:48.910
OF A PAYDAY LOAN SERVICE THAT

01:20:48.977 --> 01:20:50.712
THIS IS KIND OF A OF A DIFFERENT

01:20:50.779 --> 01:20:52.080
VERSION OF THE SAME THING BUT

01:20:52.147 --> 01:20:53.281
ARE THERE A LOT OF REASONS WHY

01:20:53.348 --> 01:20:54.583
WORKER WOULD NOT WANT THEIR

01:20:54.649 --> 01:20:55.750
EMPLOYER TO KNOW ABOUT THAT SO

01:20:55.817 --> 01:20:55.917
IF.

01:20:55.984 --> 01:20:57.085
THERE'S WAYS TO KEEP THAT

01:20:57.152 --> 01:20:58.453
INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL THAT

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.155
WOULD BE GREAT BUT OVERALL WE DO

01:21:00.222 --> 01:21:02.157
SEE THIS AS A MUCH LESS RISKY

01:21:02.224 --> 01:21:03.758
MUCH MORE.

01:21:03.825 --> 01:21:04.759
RESPONSIBLE ALTERNATIVE TO PAY

01:21:04.826 --> 01:21:06.394
LATE PAYDAY LENDING AND DO THINK

01:21:06.461 --> 01:21:07.696
IT'S AN EXCITING NEW INDUSTRY

01:21:07.762 --> 01:21:13.969
SECTOR AND LOOK FOR DAYS STAYING

01:21:14.035 --> 01:21:14.536
INVOLVED IN THE STAKEHOLDER

01:21:14.603 --> 01:21:15.237
GROUPS MOVES FORWARD.

01:21:15.303 --> 01:21:15.770
THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL

01:21:15.837 --> 01:21:16.771
COMMENTS.

01:21:16.838 --> 01:21:17.339
RIGHT SEEN AND I'M ACTUALLY

01:21:17.405 --> 01:21:17.939
GONNA ASK THE AUTHOR IF THE

01:21:18.006 --> 01:21:20.141
AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:22.377
ANY OF THIS BEFORE A TAKE MEMBER

01:21:22.444 --> 01:21:24.012
QUESTIONS JUST BECAUSE I THINK

01:21:24.079 --> 01:21:24.846
THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER.

01:21:24.913 --> 01:21:27.048
OF THE ISSUES RAISED AND PERHAPS

01:21:27.115 --> 01:21:29.651
I THINK SOME OF THEM MA'AM MAY

01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:30.318
ALSO BE ADDRESSED AND SENATE YOU

01:21:30.385 --> 01:21:31.553
DISH.

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:32.354
OKAY THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:34.623
MADAM CHAIR SO -- PART OF THAT

01:21:34.689 --> 01:21:37.325
THE CHALLENGE WITH -- SO SO LET

01:21:37.392 --> 01:21:38.727
ME JUST START OFF BY SAYING THAT

01:21:38.793 --> 01:21:39.761
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THAT

01:21:39.828 --> 01:21:41.663
WERE HERE IN THIS POSITION IS

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:43.465
THAT -- THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:21:43.531 --> 01:21:44.799
BUSINESS OVERSIGHT FELT VERY

01:21:44.866 --> 01:21:46.835
STRONGLY THAT THERE THERE SHOULD

01:21:46.901 --> 01:21:49.771
BE -- SOME OVERSIGHT OF THIS

01:21:49.838 --> 01:21:52.207
KIND OF LENDING BECAUSE IT IS

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:55.710
NOW ON THE INTERNET AND AND

01:21:55.777 --> 01:21:57.145
THERE ARE NO PROTECTIONS AND SO

01:21:57.212 --> 01:22:00.048
ON THE REASON THAT WE WAITED IN

01:22:00.115 --> 01:22:01.449
WADE.

01:22:01.516 --> 01:22:01.983
WAITED.

01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:04.886
INTO IT -- WAS BECAUSE AS YOU

01:22:04.953 --> 01:22:06.655
KNOW MADAM CHAIR I'M VERY

01:22:06.721 --> 01:22:08.123
CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE AS MANY

01:22:08.189 --> 01:22:09.758
OUTLETS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:22:09.824 --> 01:22:11.059
PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO GET.

01:22:11.126 --> 01:22:14.362
THEIR CASH WHEN THEY NEED IT --

01:22:14.429 --> 01:22:17.799
LEGITIMATELY -- AND AND THIS

01:22:17.866 --> 01:22:19.401
JUST SEEM TO MAKE A LOT OF SENSE --

01:22:19.467 --> 01:22:22.037
YOU EARN YOUR YOU EARN A CHECK

01:22:22.103 --> 01:22:23.138
AND THEN YOU GET IT AT THE END

01:22:23.204 --> 01:22:24.439
OF A PAY PERIOD BUT IN THE

01:22:24.506 --> 01:22:25.640
MEANTIME.

01:22:25.707 --> 01:22:27.976
YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS -- TO THAT

01:22:28.043 --> 01:22:29.644
MONEY AND SO ON THAT'S REALLY

01:22:29.711 --> 01:22:31.479
THE GENESIS OF OF DOING THIS

01:22:31.546 --> 01:22:33.348
WORK SO PART OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN

01:22:33.415 --> 01:22:37.018
TRYING TO DO IS -- THE THE THE

01:22:37.085 --> 01:22:38.053
CONSUMER PROTECTION

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:39.187
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN PART OF

01:22:39.254 --> 01:22:40.855
THIS DISCUSSION SO THEY'VE

01:22:40.922 --> 01:22:43.591
HELPED US -- TO PUT OUR ARMS

01:22:43.658 --> 01:22:46.861
AROUND WHAT IS RIGHT NOW -- THE

01:22:46.928 --> 01:22:48.663
WILD WEST WITH ALL OF THESE

01:22:48.730 --> 01:22:49.831
DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS DOING

01:22:49.898 --> 01:22:52.167
WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO -- AND

01:22:52.233 --> 01:22:54.803
AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO

01:22:54.869 --> 01:22:58.340
IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER

01:22:58.406 --> 01:22:59.307
FRAMEWORK FOR SETTING UP.

01:22:59.374 --> 01:23:01.009
THAT THAT WHAT YOU GET CHARGED

01:23:01.076 --> 01:23:02.110
IT DOESN'T END UP BEING LIKE A

01:23:02.177 --> 01:23:03.878
PAYDAY LOAN ONLY IT'S IT'S

01:23:03.945 --> 01:23:05.380
HIDDEN SOMEWHERE RIGHT.

01:23:05.447 --> 01:23:07.749
AND SO -- THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A

01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:10.852
CAP ON THAT IT THAT IS CERTAIN

01:23:10.919 --> 01:23:12.721
AND INCLUDE ANYTHING THAT YOU

01:23:12.787 --> 01:23:14.756
WOULD CHARGE -- IN ORDER TO

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:17.425
ACCESS YOUR MONEY -- IF THE

01:23:17.492 --> 01:23:18.560
COMPANY.

01:23:18.626 --> 01:23:21.796
REQUIRES IF THE COMPANY HAS AN

01:23:21.863 --> 01:23:25.500
EXPEDITION -- AN EXPEDITIOUS

01:23:25.567 --> 01:23:30.238
BACK CASH -- SYSTEM THEN AB AND

01:23:30.305 --> 01:23:31.673
THEY CHARGE YOU MORE FOR THAT IT

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:33.274
CAN'T IT THE TOTAL AMOUNT THAT

01:23:33.341 --> 01:23:34.509
THEY'RE CHARGING YOU CAN BE MORE

01:23:34.576 --> 01:23:36.211
THAN FIFTEEN DOLLARS SO THERE'S

01:23:36.277 --> 01:23:38.580
SOME OF THEM CHARGE -- IF YOU

01:23:38.646 --> 01:23:41.483
WANT IT SAME DAY OR THE NEXT DAY --

01:23:41.549 --> 01:23:43.852
A A SPECIAL FEE FOR THAT SO SO

01:23:43.918 --> 01:23:45.587
THAT'S WHERE THE FIFTEEN DOLLARS

01:23:45.653 --> 01:23:48.189
COMES FROM FRANKLY -- WE THAT

01:23:48.256 --> 01:23:51.793
THE 50% -- IS IS THE REASON

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:54.329
THAT'S A PART OF THAT THE PLAN

01:23:54.396 --> 01:23:56.931
IS BECAUSE AT LEAST INITIALLY WE

01:23:56.998 --> 01:23:58.600
WANT TO SEE HOW HOW THIS WORKS

01:23:58.666 --> 01:23:59.467
AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:23:59.534 --> 01:24:00.168
PEOPLE.

01:24:00.235 --> 01:24:01.770
DON'T GET TO THE END OF THEIR

01:24:01.836 --> 01:24:03.571
PAY PER PAY PERIOD AND THEN HAVE

01:24:03.638 --> 01:24:05.974
ABSOLUTELY NO MONEY AND AND FIND

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:07.909
THAT THEN THEY END UP.

01:24:07.976 --> 01:24:09.844
WITH THE PAYDAY LENDER ANYWAY --

01:24:09.911 --> 01:24:12.580
AND SO THAT THE GUARD RAILS THAT

01:24:12.647 --> 01:24:14.682
WERE SPOKEN OF THOSE WERE WERE

01:24:14.749 --> 01:24:17.085
CRAFTED WITHOUT TAKING AS MUCH

01:24:17.152 --> 01:24:19.287
INPUT FROM THE INDUSTRY AND THEN

01:24:19.354 --> 01:24:20.422
SITTING DOWN WITH THE CONSUMER

01:24:20.488 --> 01:24:21.289
GROUPS AS WELL.

01:24:21.356 --> 01:24:25.126
THE CONSUMER AND LABOR TO MAKE

01:24:25.193 --> 01:24:26.694
SURE THAT ON THAT -- THAT WE'RE

01:24:26.761 --> 01:24:28.062
DOING SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT

01:24:28.129 --> 01:24:34.969
MAKES MAKES SENSE SO -- THERE

01:24:35.036 --> 01:24:37.272
WAS A THERE WAS A MENTION.

01:24:37.338 --> 01:24:40.008
OF A AND I'M LOOKING AT MY NOTES

01:24:40.074 --> 01:24:42.844
AND I DON'T SEE IT BUT AT LEAST

01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:47.182
ONE OF THE COMPANIES -- DOESN'T

01:24:47.248 --> 01:24:48.983
CHARGE A FEE.

01:24:49.050 --> 01:24:50.785
BUT YOU CAN PAY.

01:24:50.852 --> 01:24:53.288
AS YOU CAN PAY A TIP AND YOU CAN

01:24:53.354 --> 01:24:56.658
PAY NOTHING OR YOU CAN PAY -- A

01:24:56.724 --> 01:24:58.693
LOT OF MONEY AND PART OF THE

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:00.028
CHALLENGE WITH THAT.

01:25:00.094 --> 01:25:01.996
IS IS THAT IT IT'S PART OF A

01:25:02.063 --> 01:25:03.798
COMMUNITY OF INTEREST RIGHT THAT

01:25:03.865 --> 01:25:05.700
DOES THAT ARE USING THAT SERVICE

01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:07.335
PAY FOR EACH OTHER AND HELP EACH

01:25:07.402 --> 01:25:10.071
OTHER OUT -- AND THE CHALLENGE

01:25:10.138 --> 01:25:12.006
WITH THAT IS IS PHAM I'M NOT

01:25:12.073 --> 01:25:13.675
SURE WHAT THEIR HOW THEY MAKE

01:25:13.741 --> 01:25:15.343
THEIR MONEY THEN RIGHT I MEAN

01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:16.978
AND AND IN THE DISCUSSION THAT

01:25:17.045 --> 01:25:18.346
WE'VE HAD WITH.

01:25:18.413 --> 01:25:22.050
WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT GROUPS IS-IS THE MONEY BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:25:22.116 --> 01:25:24.052
SELLING THE INFORMATION OR IS IT

01:25:24.118 --> 01:25:25.954
JUST BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE ARE

01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:28.022
PAYING. FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO

01:25:28.089 --> 01:25:29.924
GET ACCESS TO YOUR YOUR MONEY

01:25:29.991 --> 01:25:32.727
AND IT DOESN'T COST YOU ANYTHING --

01:25:32.794 --> 01:25:35.630
IT THERE THERE THE SYSTEM.

01:25:35.697 --> 01:25:36.898
THE SYSTEM DEPENDS ON A

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:40.001
COMMUNITY OF INTEREST AND AND

01:25:40.068 --> 01:25:41.636
AND THAT JUST SEEMED HARD TO

01:25:41.703 --> 01:25:42.670
REGULATE.

01:25:42.737 --> 01:25:44.839
AND HARD TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT

01:25:44.906 --> 01:25:46.774
IS THAT THEY'RE GETTING FROM THE

01:25:46.841 --> 01:25:49.477
CUSTOMERS AND BOB TO THE EXTENT

01:25:49.544 --> 01:25:51.846
THAT THEY ALSO HAVE ACCESS EMAIL

01:25:51.913 --> 01:25:54.048
AXIS -- HOW MANY TIMES THEY CAN

01:25:54.115 --> 01:25:55.750
COMMUNICATE WITH YOU AND START

01:25:55.817 --> 01:25:56.951
BUGGING YOU ABOUT YOU KNOW YOU

01:25:57.018 --> 01:25:58.786
DIDN'T TAP AND NOW WE WANT SOME

01:25:58.853 --> 01:26:00.455
MONEY AND HOW DO YOU EXPECT IT

01:26:00.522 --> 01:26:02.123
WILL THAT WE WERE JUST

01:26:02.190 --> 01:26:03.591
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT SO?

01:26:03.658 --> 01:26:06.194
SO -- SOME OF THE DETAILS IN

01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:07.529
TERMS OF HOW IT'S BEEN

01:26:07.595 --> 01:26:09.731
STRUCTURED IS TAKING EVERYBODY'S

01:26:09.797 --> 01:26:11.533
MODEL INTO CONSIDERATION IN

01:26:11.599 --> 01:26:12.800
TRYING TO BUILD SOMETHING THAT

01:26:12.867 --> 01:26:14.602
D. B. O. IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE

01:26:14.669 --> 01:26:15.970
ABLE TO REGULATE AND THAT.

01:26:16.037 --> 01:26:18.873
THAT -- ALSO HAS SOME PROTECTED

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:19.507
PROTECTIONS OF THE WORKERS AS

01:26:19.574 --> 01:26:21.409
WELL AND THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT

01:26:21.476 --> 01:26:22.310
FORMS OF COMMITTEE OF

01:26:22.377 --> 01:26:24.078
COMMUNICATION ONE IS DIRECTLY

01:26:24.145 --> 01:26:25.013
WHERE SOMEONE GETS ON THE

01:26:25.079 --> 01:26:25.747
INTERNET THE OTHER ONE IS

01:26:25.813 --> 01:26:26.714
THROUGH THE EMPLOYER THE

01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:28.216
EMPLOYER CAN OFFER THIS AS A

01:26:28.283 --> 01:26:30.985
SERVICE. TO THEIR EMPLOYEES AND

01:26:31.052 --> 01:26:33.054
THEN -- AND THEN THEY SET UP THE

01:26:33.121 --> 01:26:35.523
INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH THEIR

01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:37.358
THROUGH THEIR EMPLOYMENT --

01:26:37.425 --> 01:26:39.727
RELATIONSHIP AND WE WANTED TO

01:26:39.794 --> 01:26:40.662
MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS ARE

01:26:40.728 --> 01:26:42.630
PROTECTED AS PART PART OF THAT

01:26:42.697 --> 01:26:44.732
BECAUSE IT IT IS A IT IS.

01:26:44.799 --> 01:26:47.535
A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM BUT

01:26:47.602 --> 01:26:48.136
THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO OUT AND

01:26:48.202 --> 01:26:49.370
LOOK FOR SOMETHING THEIR

01:26:49.437 --> 01:26:50.738
EMPLOYER IS OFFERING IT AS PART

01:26:50.805 --> 01:26:52.574
OF PART OF THEIR SYSTEM.

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:53.541
AND THEN THEY DO IT THROUGH

01:26:53.608 --> 01:26:55.610
THEIR THEIR PAYROLL SYSTEM AS

01:26:55.677 --> 01:26:57.278
WELL SO -- SO THERE'S TWO

01:26:57.345 --> 01:26:58.580
DIFFERENT MODELS AND WE WE'VE

01:26:58.646 --> 01:26:59.948
TRIED TO TREAT THEM BOTH THE

01:27:00.014 --> 01:27:02.250
SAME AND AND GIVE THEM THE SAME

01:27:02.317 --> 01:27:02.984
KIND OF FLEXIBILITY.

01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:05.520
SO I AM PREPARED TO ANSWER ANY

01:27:05.587 --> 01:27:06.588
OTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU AND I

01:27:06.654 --> 01:27:08.690
DO WANT TO JUST OFFERED THE

01:27:08.756 --> 01:27:10.258
OPPORTUNITY TO THERE WAS A

01:27:10.325 --> 01:27:14.729
REFERENCE MADE SPECIFICALLY.

01:27:14.796 --> 01:27:15.496
TO THE TIP MODEL AND SO I DIDN'T

01:27:15.563 --> 01:27:16.097
KNOW IF YOU WANTED TO BRIEFLY

01:27:16.164 --> 01:27:17.832
ANSWER THAT BECAUSE THEY DO WANT

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:18.366
TO GET TO MEMBERS COMMENTS

01:27:18.433 --> 01:27:19.267
QUESTIONS.

01:27:19.334 --> 01:27:20.034
YOUR COMPANY OPERATES ON A

01:27:20.101 --> 01:27:21.402
COMPLETELY TO BASE MODEL WE

01:27:21.469 --> 01:27:22.403
DON'T CHARGE ME FEES IN ADDITION

01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:24.639
TO TIPS THERE'S ONE OTHER

01:27:24.706 --> 01:27:25.239
COMPANY THAT DOES TIPS AS WELL

01:27:25.306 --> 01:27:27.709
AS FEES -- IS THE FIRST OF WE

01:27:27.775 --> 01:27:28.743
DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION IN

01:27:28.810 --> 01:27:30.211
FACT WE'VE TURNED DOWN COMPLY

01:27:30.278 --> 01:27:31.746
RELATIONSHIPS WITH A PROCESS TO

01:27:31.813 --> 01:27:33.314
PICTURE INFORMATION WE REFUSE TO

01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:34.015
GET INTO THOSE.

01:27:34.082 --> 01:27:35.416
SO WE DO NOT SHARE INFORMATION

01:27:35.483 --> 01:27:37.919
WITH ANYBODY -- MUSIC FOR THE

01:27:37.986 --> 01:27:39.654
PRODUCT.

01:27:39.721 --> 01:27:41.990
THE WAVE OF AND WE THINK OF THE

01:27:42.056 --> 01:27:43.825
SERVICE OF A WE'RE ON TAPES NOT

01:27:43.891 --> 01:27:45.526
JUST FOR ACCESS TO WAGES BUT

01:27:45.593 --> 01:27:46.794
ALSO FOR OUR HEALTH CARE PRODUCT.

01:27:46.861 --> 01:27:49.030
WE NEGOTIATE DOWN MEDICAL BILLS

01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:51.733
AND WE DON'T CHARGEFOR IT WE

01:27:51.799 --> 01:27:52.300
TELL PEOPLE TO PASS WHATEVER

01:27:52.367 --> 01:27:52.967
THEY THINK IS FAIR.

01:27:53.034 --> 01:27:54.235
BOTH THE SERVICES WHETHER IT'S

01:27:54.302 --> 01:27:55.470
ACCESS YOUR OWN PAGE OR ACCESS

01:27:55.536 --> 01:27:56.371
TO AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE.

01:27:56.437 --> 01:27:57.238
WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD

01:27:57.305 --> 01:27:58.606
BE HELD BACK FROM SOMEONE

01:27:58.673 --> 01:27:59.874
BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO

01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:01.309
MAKE TO PAY A FEE.

01:28:01.376 --> 01:28:02.810
SO IF SOMEBODY'S ON ABLE TO

01:28:02.877 --> 01:28:04.412
AFFORD IT WE BELIEVE THAT THEY

01:28:04.479 --> 01:28:05.046
SHOULD STILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE

01:28:05.113 --> 01:28:06.047
SERVICE.

01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:08.216
IF THEY ARE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT

01:28:08.282 --> 01:28:08.850
THEN THEY CAN PAY US WHAT THEY

01:28:08.916 --> 01:28:10.018
THINK IS FAIR.

01:28:10.084 --> 01:28:10.652
AND IF THERE'S A SITUATION WHERE

01:28:10.718 --> 01:28:11.586
THEY CAN HELP OUT OTHER PEOPLE

01:28:11.653 --> 01:28:13.655
WE ACTUALLY WANT WE LIKE THAT

01:28:13.721 --> 01:28:16.758
THAT PEOPLE HELP OTHER PEOPLE --

01:28:16.824 --> 01:28:18.426
TO ME I THINK IT'S WE TALK ABOUT

01:28:18.493 --> 01:28:18.993
THE AMERICAN DREAM IS THAT

01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:20.094
PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY LIKE COME UP

01:28:20.161 --> 01:28:21.929
AND THAT THE RESPONSE RELEASE

01:28:21.996 --> 01:28:23.064
COMPLETELY UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL.

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:24.532
REALTY THAT IS NOT COMPLETELY UP

01:28:24.599 --> 01:28:26.968
THE INDIVIDUAL TO BE TO COME UP

01:28:27.035 --> 01:28:28.870
LIKE WE SHOULD PERMIT TO THE

01:28:28.936 --> 01:28:30.238
SOCIETY WERE -- COMMITTEE WHERE

01:28:30.304 --> 01:28:30.905
PEOPLE ACTUALLY HELP EACH OTHER

01:28:30.972 --> 01:28:31.906
OUT.

01:28:31.973 --> 01:28:33.908
IT'S SO I KNOW THAT IT'S A NEW

01:28:33.975 --> 01:28:35.643
MODEL PEOPLE HELPING PEOPLE --

01:28:35.710 --> 01:28:36.310
BUT JUST BECAUSE IT'S NEW AND WE

01:28:36.377 --> 01:28:37.245
DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH IT

01:28:37.311 --> 01:28:38.513
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:28:38.579 --> 01:28:39.080
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH PEOPLE

01:28:39.147 --> 01:28:39.814
HELPING PEOPLE.

01:28:39.881 --> 01:28:41.349
I THINK CHAU ACTUALLY WANT

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:43.785
PEOPLE TO HELP PEOPLE -- IT'S A

01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:44.385
THAT'S HOW WE STRUCTURE THIS

01:28:44.452 --> 01:28:46.721
WHERE IF YOU WANT HELP SOMEONE

01:28:46.788 --> 01:28:47.355
WE TELL YOU THAT IS GOING HELP

01:28:47.422 --> 01:28:48.222
SOMEBODY ELSE.

01:28:48.289 --> 01:28:49.824
AND THAT SOMEBODY ELSE WILL

01:28:49.891 --> 01:28:50.425
ACTUALLY SEND YOU A THANK YOU

01:28:50.491 --> 01:28:52.760
MESSAGE -- INTO REALLY DOES FEEL

01:28:52.827 --> 01:28:54.228
LIKE A COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE

01:28:54.295 --> 01:28:55.663
HELPING EACH OTHER OUT.

01:28:55.730 --> 01:28:57.031
THANK YOU AND WITH THAT I WILL

01:28:57.098 --> 01:28:58.232
OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS OR

01:28:58.299 --> 01:29:02.236
COMMENTS -- FROM THE MEMBERS.

01:29:02.303 --> 01:29:04.839
A SAM ROBERT CAN -- SO I WANT TO

01:29:04.906 --> 01:29:06.240
START BY THINKING OFFER I THINK

01:29:06.307 --> 01:29:07.108
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT

01:29:07.175 --> 01:29:09.177
PROJECTIONS IN HERE AS WELL --

01:29:09.243 --> 01:29:10.178
AND I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT

01:29:10.244 --> 01:29:11.245
THAT OUR CONSUMERS ARE PROTECTED

01:29:11.312 --> 01:29:13.014
EVERY TURN ESPECIALLY WHEN IT

01:29:13.081 --> 01:29:15.717
COMES TO THEIR EARNINGS -- I

01:29:15.783 --> 01:29:18.219
HEARD ALL OF YOU SAY ON EVERY

01:29:18.286 --> 01:29:19.987
BETWEEN NURSE OF GIVING UP THE

01:29:20.054 --> 01:29:21.589
SHINS THE TRAINERS AND THE

01:29:21.656 --> 01:29:23.591
SUPPORT THAT WERE THIS IS A SAFE

01:29:23.658 --> 01:29:25.126
INEXPENSIVE SOLUTION AND THEN

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:26.961
AND WE WANT TO PROTECT IT -- AND

01:29:27.028 --> 01:29:27.962
ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS REALLY

01:29:28.029 --> 01:29:29.063
THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS

01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:30.198
AND NONE OF YOU SPOKE ABOUT THE

01:29:30.264 --> 01:29:31.432
AMENDMENT THAT RELATES TO THE

01:29:31.499 --> 01:29:33.134
THREE ADVANCES PER WEEK AS WELL

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:34.602
WHICH IS ANOTHER REGULATION THAT

01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:37.972
I THINK IS BEING ADDED TO THIS --

01:29:38.039 --> 01:29:38.639
IS THAT THIS PUTS REGULATIONS IN

01:29:38.706 --> 01:29:40.141
GUARDRAILS IN PLACE THAT ARE NOT

01:29:40.208 --> 01:29:41.743
PUT INTO PLACE ON OUR PAYDAY

01:29:41.809 --> 01:29:44.011
LOANS AND OUR OTHER I WOULD SAY

01:29:44.078 --> 01:29:46.013
MORE PROBLEMATIC PRODUCTS.

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.715
AND SO I GUESS MY CONCERN IS

01:29:47.782 --> 01:29:48.916
THAT.

01:29:48.983 --> 01:29:50.551
I'M SOMEBODY WHO MY RENT COMES

01:29:50.618 --> 01:29:52.854
DO I NEED TO PAY MY RANTS MY

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.088
RENT IS MORE THAN 50% OF MY

01:29:54.155 --> 01:29:56.157
EARNED INCOME I CAN ONLY GET MY

01:29:56.224 --> 01:29:56.991
50% SO THEN I GO TO A PAYDAY

01:29:57.058 --> 01:29:57.658
LOAN.

01:29:57.725 --> 01:29:59.660
AND THAT I WOULD ACTUALLY RATHER

01:29:59.727 --> 01:30:01.662
OUR CONSTITUENTS BE ABLE TO GET

01:30:01.729 --> 01:30:02.730
ACCESS TO EARNED INCOME IN A

01:30:02.797 --> 01:30:04.465
SAFE AND INEXPENSIVE WAY AND SO

01:30:04.532 --> 01:30:05.366
I GUESS I'M CONFUSED WHY WOULD

01:30:05.433 --> 01:30:06.768
PUT THESE GUARDRAILS UP IN THIS

01:30:06.834 --> 01:30:07.435
SITUATION WHEN WE'RE NOT PUTTING

01:30:07.502 --> 01:30:08.236
THEM UP.

01:30:08.302 --> 01:30:09.537
ON WATER ARGUABLY MORE

01:30:09.604 --> 01:30:11.072
PROBLEMATIC PRODUCTS BECAUSE

01:30:11.139 --> 01:30:12.039
THAT MIGHT.

01:30:12.106 --> 01:30:13.274
MAKE A GUESS I SEE WHAT THE

01:30:13.341 --> 01:30:14.709
OPPOSITION IS SAYING IT MIGHT

01:30:14.776 --> 01:30:16.944
TURN PEOPLE TO MORE PROBLEMATIC --

01:30:17.011 --> 01:30:17.812
PRODUCTS AND I SEE THAT

01:30:17.879 --> 01:30:20.982
SPECIFICALLY IN THE 50% IN THE

01:30:21.048 --> 01:30:21.949
THREE THE CAP ON THE THREE

01:30:22.016 --> 01:30:23.184
ADVANCES PER WEEK ON THE THINGS

01:30:23.251 --> 01:30:26.587
THAT WE DON'T DO IN THESE OTHER

01:30:26.654 --> 01:30:27.188
SOLUTIONS TO HAVE THOUGHTS ON

01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:27.722
THEM.

01:30:27.789 --> 01:30:29.423
YEAH I'M NOT HERE TO ADVOCATE

01:30:29.490 --> 01:30:30.057
FOR PAYDAY LOANS.

01:30:30.124 --> 01:30:32.093
HONESTLY -- THEIR THEIR

01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:34.829
PROBLEMATIC AND AND I THINK

01:30:34.896 --> 01:30:35.897
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT

01:30:35.963 --> 01:30:37.231
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR OTHER

01:30:37.298 --> 01:30:40.101
ALTERNATIVES IS BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:30:40.168 --> 01:30:44.272
PROBLEMATIC -- I GUESS THE THAT

01:30:44.338 --> 01:30:45.807
THE ONLY ANSWER I CAN GIVE YOU

01:30:45.873 --> 01:30:46.941
IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE SOME OF

01:30:47.008 --> 01:30:49.210
THE SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS IN

01:30:49.277 --> 01:30:50.645
TERMS OF A CAP AND HOW MANY

01:30:50.711 --> 01:30:52.046
TIMES YOU CAN ACCESS AND HOW

01:30:52.113 --> 01:30:54.549
MUCH MONEY YOU CAN TAKE OUT.

01:30:54.615 --> 01:30:57.718
IS BECAUSE THERE -- THERE ARE --

01:30:57.785 --> 01:31:01.088
ADVOCATES THAT BELIEVE THAT --

01:31:01.155 --> 01:31:03.257
WELL.

01:31:03.324 --> 01:31:06.294
THERE WERE EVEN MORE.

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.229
MORE STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS THAT

01:31:08.296 --> 01:31:09.797
WE JUST DIDN'T WANT IT TAKE

01:31:09.864 --> 01:31:11.132
BECAUSE WE WANT THIS THIS IS AN

01:31:11.199 --> 01:31:13.034
EMERGING OPPORTUNITY AND WE WANT

01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:14.869
IT TO BE AS FLEXIBLE AND AS USER

01:31:14.936 --> 01:31:16.470
FRIENDLY AS POSSIBLE.

01:31:16.537 --> 01:31:18.472
SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO

01:31:18.539 --> 01:31:19.740
IS TO FIGURE IT WITHOUT BEING.

01:31:19.807 --> 01:31:21.309
PATRONIZING ABOUT THE WHOLE

01:31:21.375 --> 01:31:24.946
THING -- IS TO SET SOME -- SOME

01:31:25.012 --> 01:31:26.781
GUARD RAILS UP SO PEOPLE CAN USE

01:31:26.848 --> 01:31:28.716
IT AND WE WE COME BACK AND WE

01:31:28.783 --> 01:31:29.917
TAKE A LOOK AT HOW IT'S BEEN

01:31:29.984 --> 01:31:30.518
WORKING.

01:31:30.585 --> 01:31:32.320
AT FOR THAT FOR THAT PERIOD OF

01:31:32.386 --> 01:31:34.121
TIME I THINK PART OF THE

01:31:34.188 --> 01:31:37.158
CHALLENGES IS THAT -- WE DON'T

01:31:37.225 --> 01:31:38.292
WANT TO CONTROL HOW PEOPLE ARE

01:31:38.359 --> 01:31:40.328
USING IT RIGHT MAY USE THE

01:31:40.394 --> 01:31:43.297
EXAMPLE OF THE RENT -- BUT IT

01:31:43.364 --> 01:31:50.171
IT'S THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER

01:31:50.238 --> 01:31:51.839
THINGS THAT CAN BE USED.

01:31:51.906 --> 01:31:53.307
FOR THAT ARE THAT KIND OF THE

01:31:53.374 --> 01:31:55.576
NECESSITIES THAT POP UP WHICH IS

01:31:55.643 --> 01:31:58.946
FOOD GAS EVERYTHING THAT THAT

01:31:59.013 --> 01:32:03.951
YOU HEARD -- THAT -- IN THE END

01:32:04.018 --> 01:32:04.252
[inaudible]

01:32:04.318 --> 01:32:05.987
PEOPLE.

01:32:06.053 --> 01:32:07.455
IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY MANAGEMENT

01:32:07.521 --> 01:32:09.323
AND AND PART OF THE CHALLENGE IS

01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:09.991
THAT.

01:32:10.057 --> 01:32:12.126
IS THAT IF YOU KNOW WHAT IF IF

01:32:12.193 --> 01:32:13.794
YOUR CHECK ISN'T ENOUGH AT THE

01:32:13.861 --> 01:32:15.162
END OF THE DAY TO COVER ANY

01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:17.565
EMERGENCIES THEN IT'S NOT GONNA

01:32:17.632 --> 01:32:18.900
BE IT ENOUGH AT THE END EITHER

01:32:18.966 --> 01:32:19.834
AND SO.

01:32:19.901 --> 01:32:21.202
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO

01:32:21.269 --> 01:32:22.870
CREATEAN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE

01:32:22.937 --> 01:32:24.872
TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS SOME CASH

01:32:24.939 --> 01:32:26.474
TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF

01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:26.707
THINGS?

01:32:26.774 --> 01:32:27.942
THAT WILL.

01:32:28.009 --> 01:32:29.277
COST THEM A LOT OF MONEY IF THEY

01:32:29.343 --> 01:32:30.778
DON'T PAY.

01:32:30.845 --> 01:32:33.147
BECAUSE OF THE LATE FEES BECAUSE

01:32:33.214 --> 01:32:35.416
OF OF PENALTIES -- BUT ALSO

01:32:35.483 --> 01:32:36.450
LEAVE THEM WITH WITH THE MONEY

01:32:36.517 --> 01:32:37.485
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO BE

01:32:37.551 --> 01:32:39.053
ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THE REST OF

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.554
THE OBLIGATIONS THAT THEY HAVE

01:32:40.621 --> 01:32:42.323
THROUGHOUT THE THROUGHOUT THE

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:45.459
MONTH SO -- I MEAN YOU RAISE A

01:32:45.526 --> 01:32:46.427
GOOD QUESTION.

01:32:46.494 --> 01:32:48.729
BUT WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO

01:32:48.796 --> 01:32:50.564
IS TO WORK WITH THE CONSUMER

01:32:50.631 --> 01:32:51.666
GROUPS AS WELL THAT SAY WE'RE

01:32:51.732 --> 01:32:53.367
REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AND

01:32:53.434 --> 01:32:54.969
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT --

01:32:55.036 --> 01:32:56.537
THAT PEOPLE AREN'T AREN'T TAKING

01:32:56.604 --> 01:32:57.872
OUT ALL THE MONEY THAT THEY'RE

01:32:57.939 --> 01:32:58.940
GOING TO GET BY THE END OF THE

01:32:59.006 --> 01:32:59.974
END OF THE MONTH AND THEN

01:33:00.041 --> 01:33:01.108
THEY'RE AT THEIR AT A PAYDAY

01:33:01.175 --> 01:33:01.943
LENDER BECAUSE THEY GOT A WHOLE

01:33:02.009 --> 01:33:03.311
MONTH NOW OR ANOTHER TWO WEEKS

01:33:03.377 --> 01:33:04.578
THAT THEY NEED TO GET THROUGH.

01:33:04.645 --> 01:33:05.980
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE -- TO AND

01:33:06.047 --> 01:33:08.015
PAY THINGS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE

01:33:08.082 --> 01:33:09.417
TO MAINTAIN THEIR THEIR

01:33:09.483 --> 01:33:10.718
LIFESTYLEOR TO BE ABLE.

01:33:10.785 --> 01:33:12.219
TO FEED THE KIDS OR WHATEVER IT

01:33:12.286 --> 01:33:15.656
IS THAT THEY'RE DOING SO -- I

01:33:15.723 --> 01:33:16.557
DON'T HAVE THE PERFECT ANSWER

01:33:16.624 --> 01:33:17.558
FOR THAT EITHER THEN IT'S IT'S

01:33:17.625 --> 01:33:19.760
PART OF WHAT'S BEEN NEGOTIATED

01:33:19.827 --> 01:33:21.696
OVER A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS YEAH

01:33:21.762 --> 01:33:22.263
AND I GUESS IT COMES ON A

01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:23.564
PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION OF

01:33:23.631 --> 01:33:24.298
WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD BE

01:33:24.365 --> 01:33:25.333
CONTROLLING.

01:33:25.399 --> 01:33:27.101
ACCESS TO THAT CAPITAL OR NO

01:33:27.168 --> 01:33:28.502
THAT'S EXACTLY REGS.

01:33:28.569 --> 01:33:30.237
WHICH WE CAN ALL PROBABLY COME

01:33:30.304 --> 01:33:31.839
TO DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS ON I DO

01:33:31.906 --> 01:33:32.707
HAVE ONE ADDITIONAL QUESTION

01:33:32.773 --> 01:33:33.841
WHICH IS PACKED OF IS THE

01:33:33.908 --> 01:33:34.809
SPONSOR AYE.

01:33:34.875 --> 01:33:36.143
IT'S MY UNDERSTAND HAS GIVEN IS

01:33:36.210 --> 01:33:37.778
A FOR PROFIT COMPANY RIGHT

01:33:37.845 --> 01:33:40.147
CORRECT I'M IN THIS READS TO ME

01:33:40.214 --> 01:33:41.482
FROM THE ANALYSIS LIKE WORK HARD

01:33:41.549 --> 01:33:42.850
TO FIND YOUR BUSINESS MODEL INTO

01:33:42.917 --> 01:33:44.819
LAW WHICH GIVES ME A LITTLE

01:33:44.885 --> 01:33:46.287
DISCOMFORT CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT.

01:33:46.354 --> 01:33:48.289
I THINK I CAN I CAN ANSWER THAT

01:33:48.356 --> 01:33:49.357
AND THEN CENTER IF YOU CAN

01:33:49.423 --> 01:33:50.458
ANSWER THAT BECAUSE THIS WAS THE

01:33:50.524 --> 01:33:52.193
ISN'T LAST HEARINGS AS WELL --

01:33:52.259 --> 01:33:53.928
WE DID TAKE THE STEP TO SPONSOR

01:33:53.995 --> 01:33:56.497
THE BILL -- AS A MATTER OF FACT.

01:33:56.564 --> 01:34:02.169
OUR APPROACH AND WERE UP.

01:34:02.236 --> 01:34:03.537
PRODUCTS DO NOT EVEN RELATE TO

01:34:03.604 --> 01:34:04.939
OR ONE OF THE PRODUCT IS NOT

01:34:05.006 --> 01:34:05.573
EVEN RELATE TO WHAT IS IN THE

01:34:05.639 --> 01:34:06.140
BILL WHICH IS THE DIRECT TO

01:34:06.207 --> 01:34:06.807
CONSUMER SOLUTION WE DON'T EVEN

01:34:06.874 --> 01:34:09.577
HAVE THAT -- AS A COMPANY -- AS

01:34:09.643 --> 01:34:12.346
FAR AS THE THE INCOME AXIS IS

01:34:12.413 --> 01:34:13.948
CONCERNED -- IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:34:14.015 --> 01:34:16.150
FREQUENCY OF ACCESS IF YOU LOOK

01:34:16.217 --> 01:34:17.651
AT THE PERCENTAGE OF ACCESS.

01:34:17.718 --> 01:34:18.853
VIA GIVING.

01:34:18.919 --> 01:34:20.654
SELF IMPOSED RESTRICTION WITH A

01:34:20.721 --> 01:34:23.858
GUARD RAILS 50% OF NET INCOME.

01:34:23.924 --> 01:34:25.993
THE BILL TALKS ABOUT 50% OF

01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:28.662
GROSS INCOME WHICH IS ALMOST 70%

01:34:28.729 --> 01:34:30.197
OF NET INCOME.

01:34:30.264 --> 01:34:33.801
SOUL BE CHARGE A FIVE DOLLAR FEE

01:34:33.868 --> 01:34:35.436
FOR THREE AXIS IS NOW IN OUR

01:34:35.503 --> 01:34:36.837
BUSINESS MODEL.

01:34:36.904 --> 01:34:39.106
THE BILL TALKS ABOUT FIFTEEN

01:34:39.173 --> 01:34:41.042
DOLLARS IN A MONTH SO THERE ARE

01:34:41.108 --> 01:34:43.277
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AND I

01:34:43.344 --> 01:34:43.978
THINK THERE'S BEEN A PRETTY

01:34:44.045 --> 01:34:45.012
ROBUST.

01:34:45.079 --> 01:34:46.547
AND OF VERY PARTICIPATING

01:34:46.614 --> 01:34:48.449
PROCESS WE DID INITIATE AND

01:34:48.516 --> 01:34:49.984
START THE PROCESS BUT TO

01:34:50.051 --> 01:34:51.652
CLASSIFY IT AND SAID THAT YOU

01:34:51.719 --> 01:34:52.987
KNOW -- BUT SOME STAKEHOLDERS

01:34:53.054 --> 01:34:54.288
THAT IT IS A ONE COMPANY BILL AT

01:34:54.355 --> 01:34:56.624
THINK IT DOES A DISSERVICE TO

01:34:56.690 --> 01:34:57.992
ALL THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE.

01:34:58.059 --> 01:34:59.927
ON THIS BILL FOR MONTHS AT THIS

01:34:59.994 --> 01:35:01.729
POINT OF VIEW WE HAVE DONE

01:35:01.796 --> 01:35:03.631
NOTHING EXCEPT SUPPORT THE BILL

01:35:03.697 --> 01:35:05.132
AND AND THE SENATOR HAS BEEN

01:35:05.199 --> 01:35:06.500
WHILE WORKING.

01:35:06.567 --> 01:35:07.468
DILIGENTLY WITH ALL THE

01:35:07.535 --> 01:35:12.173
STAKEHOLDERS AND TAKING THEIR

01:35:12.239 --> 01:35:14.341
INPUT -- IN THE BILL.

01:35:14.408 --> 01:35:15.309
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

01:35:15.376 --> 01:35:16.410
LET ME AMPLIFY ON THIS POINT

01:35:16.477 --> 01:35:19.246
HERE -- ACTUALLY THAT'S ONLY BY

01:35:19.313 --> 01:35:21.115
WAY OF THE SORRY -- I I THOUGHT

01:35:21.182 --> 01:35:22.817
THE QUESTION WAS ON THE 50%

01:35:22.883 --> 01:35:24.618
SORRY ABOUT THAT BUT THE DEATH

01:35:24.685 --> 01:35:25.686
CHANCE TO SCRAP.

01:35:25.753 --> 01:35:27.455
IT WITH THE WOULD YOU LIKE TO

01:35:27.521 --> 01:35:30.624
HEAR FROM THE WINNERS ON THIS

01:35:30.691 --> 01:35:30.925
[inaudible]

01:35:30.991 --> 01:35:33.928
CHORE.

01:35:33.994 --> 01:35:37.898
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

01:35:37.965 --> 01:35:38.099
YEAH.

01:35:38.165 --> 01:35:39.033
ADDRESS THE POINT.

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:40.601
I JUST WANNA AMPLIFY I THINK

01:35:40.668 --> 01:35:41.702
PROBABLY WHAT THE SENATORS ARE

01:35:41.769 --> 01:35:46.707
HE SAID -- IN THAT CONTEXT.

01:35:46.774 --> 01:35:47.608
SO YEAH WE DO A VERY STRONG VIEW

01:35:47.675 --> 01:35:49.310
ON THIS AS YOU CAN TELL.

01:35:49.376 --> 01:35:52.580
THAT -- THAT THE CONSUMER AND

01:35:52.646 --> 01:35:55.883
THE WORKER WILL BE HARMED.

01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:56.550
IF THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ALL

01:35:56.617 --> 01:35:57.718
THEIR MONEY NOW WE KNOW THAT

01:35:57.785 --> 01:35:59.053
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN AT THIS

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.321
BUSINESS FOR FOUR YEARS.

01:36:00.387 --> 01:36:01.455
AND WE'VE SEEN EVERY SINGLE

01:36:01.522 --> 01:36:03.424
PAYMENT GO THROW AS I SAID

01:36:03.491 --> 01:36:05.159
BEFORE NEVER ONCE HAVE I HAD A

01:36:05.226 --> 01:36:06.494
SINGLE PERSON.

01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:07.962
ACROSS ALL OF THE USERS

01:36:08.028 --> 01:36:10.197
INCLUDING IN CALIFORNIA EVER

01:36:10.264 --> 01:36:11.632
RECEIVE NOTHING ON PAYDAY.

01:36:11.699 --> 01:36:13.601
SO HERE I JUST OR TICKET WHAT

01:36:13.667 --> 01:36:15.069
ARE ISSUE IS.

01:36:15.136 --> 01:36:16.770
WE DO BELIEVE THAT WITHOUT THAT

01:36:16.837 --> 01:36:18.139
FULL ACCESS PEOPLE WILL GO TO

01:36:18.205 --> 01:36:20.875
SUB OPTIMAL OR INFERIOR.

01:36:20.941 --> 01:36:22.610
OTHER SOURCES OF CAPITAL BECAUSE

01:36:22.676 --> 01:36:23.544
AT THE END OF THE DAY THE

01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:26.247
UTILITY BILL OR THE RENT IT HAS

01:36:26.313 --> 01:36:27.548
TO GET PAID.

01:36:27.615 --> 01:36:29.316
BECAUSE THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT

01:36:29.383 --> 01:36:31.152
PAYING THAT ARE DIRE.

01:36:31.218 --> 01:36:32.219
IN SO.

01:36:32.286 --> 01:36:34.688
THE ABILITY TO ACCESS ALL OF

01:36:34.755 --> 01:36:36.323
YOUR INCOME WHEN YOU WANT.

01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:37.791
WE BELIEVE ALLEVIATE THAT

01:36:37.858 --> 01:36:39.894
PRESSURE.

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:41.162
I THINK THERE IS THAT.

01:36:41.228 --> 01:36:43.264
SORT OF AN UNDER TO A A SUBTEXT

01:36:43.330 --> 01:36:48.002
HERE AS WELL -- UNITE I FOLLOWED.

01:36:48.068 --> 01:36:48.602
EIGHTY FIVE THIRTY NINE AND IF

01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:49.737
THIS BILL.

01:36:49.803 --> 01:36:51.972
REALLY DID PUT A DENT IN THE

01:36:52.039 --> 01:36:53.274
PAYDAY LENDING INDUSTRY.

01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:54.875
I'M GUESSING WE WHAT HURTS MY

01:36:54.942 --> 01:36:56.143
POSITION FROM THAT.

01:36:56.210 --> 01:36:57.278
WE'VE NOT HEARD ANY OPPOSITION

01:36:57.344 --> 01:36:59.313
BECAUSE THE REALITY IS IF PEOPLE

01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:00.848
ARE LIMITED TO ONLY HALF OF

01:37:00.915 --> 01:37:01.682
THEIR INCOME.

01:37:01.749 --> 01:37:03.851
THEY WILL STILL.

01:37:03.918 --> 01:37:05.386
GO TO A PAYDAY LENDER BECAUSE

01:37:05.452 --> 01:37:07.021
THAT IS THE ONLY AVAILABLE

01:37:07.087 --> 01:37:08.989
SOURCE OF CAPITAL FOR SOMEONE

01:37:09.056 --> 01:37:10.457
WHO JUST IS IN THAT DESPERATE OF

01:37:10.524 --> 01:37:11.859
THE SITUATION.

01:37:11.926 --> 01:37:14.895
I TAKE VERY MUCH THIS ANALYSIS

01:37:14.962 --> 01:37:15.529
THAT WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO

01:37:15.596 --> 01:37:17.765
WIND UP AT THE END OF THE PAY

01:37:17.831 --> 01:37:19.433
PERIOD WITHOUT ANYTHING.

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:20.935
WHICH IS WHY WOULD I THINK A AN

01:37:21.001 --> 01:37:23.571
ELEGANT SOLUTION WOULD BE GIVE

01:37:23.637 --> 01:37:24.939
PEOPLE ACCESS.

01:37:25.005 --> 01:37:26.874
AND IF THEY ARE IN THAT POSITION

01:37:26.941 --> 01:37:28.576
REPEATEDLY.

01:37:28.642 --> 01:37:30.878
TWICE EVERY SIX MONTHS.

01:37:30.945 --> 01:37:32.146
THAT THEY WERE THEN BE A RATCHET

01:37:32.213 --> 01:37:35.149
BACK 250% OF THE EARNED INCOME

01:37:35.216 --> 01:37:37.051
AMOUNT.

01:37:37.117 --> 01:37:38.118
OUR AND I'M GOING TO WRAP IT UP

01:37:38.185 --> 01:37:39.086
AND WE HAVE OTHER MEMBERS WITH

01:37:39.153 --> 01:37:40.588
QUESTIONS TOO SO YEAH I KNOW

01:37:40.654 --> 01:37:41.589
THANK YOU AND I THINK ONE OF I

01:37:41.655 --> 01:37:42.323
JUST YOU KNOW.

01:37:42.389 --> 01:37:43.924
I GUESS MY CONCERN AND WE HAVE A

01:37:43.991 --> 01:37:45.059
QUESTION ON THE CHAIRS BILL

01:37:45.125 --> 01:37:46.126
WHICH WAS FIVE THIRTY NINE I

01:37:46.193 --> 01:37:47.695
THINK YEAH -- ABOUT MAKING SURE

01:37:47.761 --> 01:37:52.333
THAT AS WE DECREASE THE ACCESS.

01:37:52.399 --> 01:37:53.834
TO BAD PRODUCTS WHICH WE I

01:37:53.901 --> 01:37:55.369
SUPPORTED I CONTINUE TO SUPPORT

01:37:55.436 --> 01:37:56.237
WHICH IS IMPORTANT WE NEED TO

01:37:56.303 --> 01:37:57.671
MAKE SURE THAT THE ON BANKS HAVE

01:37:57.738 --> 01:37:58.706
ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND I THINK

01:37:58.772 --> 01:38:00.307
THAT'S ONE OF THE PARTIES HERE

01:38:00.374 --> 01:38:01.609
IS DOING THAT IN A SAFE WAY BUT

01:38:01.675 --> 01:38:03.244
ENSURING THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS

01:38:03.310 --> 01:38:03.544
TO CAPITAL.

01:38:03.611 --> 01:38:04.511
EVEN AFTER AND BANKED IN THAT

01:38:04.578 --> 01:38:05.846
THIS IS ONE OF THE SOLUTION SO I

01:38:05.913 --> 01:38:07.047
THINK YOU FROM BEING IN THE

01:38:07.114 --> 01:38:07.982
SPACE AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET

01:38:08.048 --> 01:38:09.350
TO A CONCLUSION.

01:38:09.416 --> 01:38:12.586
THANK YOU AND I THINK.

01:38:12.653 --> 01:38:13.721

GOOD WORK ON THIS.

01:38:19.093 --> 01:38:21.262
I THINK IT'S JUST ONE OF THE

01:38:21.328 --> 01:38:23.130
ANSWERS THAT WE CAN LOOK FOR FOR

01:38:23.197 --> 01:38:24.465
ACCESS TO CAPITAL.

01:38:24.531 --> 01:38:25.499
ESPECIALLY IN THIS PARTICULAR

01:38:25.566 --> 01:38:27.001
CASE WHERE IT'S NOT ALONE IT'S

01:38:27.067 --> 01:38:28.702
ACTUALLY -- TAPPING INTO EARNED

01:38:28.769 --> 01:38:29.403
INCOME.

01:38:29.470 --> 01:38:31.338
AND I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT IF

01:38:31.405 --> 01:38:32.606
I UNDERSTAND THIS CORRECTLY THIS

01:38:32.673 --> 01:38:34.241
IS NOT THE END OF CONVERSATION

01:38:34.308 --> 01:38:35.109
FOR THE BILL.

01:38:35.175 --> 01:38:36.844
THERE'S GOING TO BE PLENTY OF

01:38:36.910 --> 01:38:38.012
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THIS BILL TO

01:38:38.078 --> 01:38:39.346
BE WORKED ON AND FOR

01:38:39.413 --> 01:38:41.682
CONVERSATIONS TO TAKE PLACE --

01:38:41.749 --> 01:38:43.817

THE BOLD STATEMENTS BEING MADE

01:38:54.928 --> 01:38:56.930

MONTH -- CAP -- FOR SOME PEOPLE

01:39:43.811 --> 01:39:44.945
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A LOT OF MONEY

01:39:45.012 --> 01:39:45.612
FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT IS A LOT OF

01:39:45.679 --> 01:39:48.849
MONEY -- I AND I KNOW THE THE%

01:39:48.916 --> 01:39:49.950
NATIONAL CONSUMER LAW CENTER

01:39:50.017 --> 01:39:51.552
SENTINEL OTHER OF OPPOSITION AND

01:39:51.618 --> 01:39:53.187
OF THAT IT REACHED IN TIME BUT

01:39:53.253 --> 01:39:54.655
THEY HAD SUGGESTED FIVE DOLLARS

01:39:54.722 --> 01:39:56.523
A MONTH IS A CAB -- CAN YOU JUST

01:39:56.590 --> 01:39:57.591
TALK THROUGH HOW YOU COULD HAVE

01:39:57.658 --> 01:39:58.726
GOT TO THAT FIFTEEN DOLLAR MONTH

01:39:58.792 --> 01:40:00.794
HE IN JUST FOR A FOR A REAL LOW

01:40:00.861 --> 01:40:01.628
INCOME FOLKS IS THERE A WAY THAT

01:40:01.695 --> 01:40:02.396
WE CAN.

01:40:02.463 --> 01:40:04.164
REDUCE THAT FEED MORE.

01:40:04.231 --> 01:40:05.265
WELL YOU HEARD YOU HEARD TODAY

01:40:05.332 --> 01:40:08.335
THAT -- SOME OF THE PROVIDERS --

01:40:08.402 --> 01:40:11.438
CHARGE A LOT LESS -- IT WAS

01:40:11.505 --> 01:40:13.207
NEGOTIATED FRANKLY -- WHEN WE

01:40:13.273 --> 01:40:14.975
WROTE THE BILL IT WAS --

01:40:15.042 --> 01:40:15.809
FOURTEEN WE PICKED IT OUT OF THE

01:40:15.876 --> 01:40:17.044
AIR BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO

01:40:17.111 --> 01:40:18.912
ESTABLISH SOMETHING FROM WHICH

01:40:18.979 --> 01:40:21.548
WE COULD WE COULD TALK -- AND IN

01:40:21.615 --> 01:40:23.484
THE END -- THAT THE MODELS WERE

01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:26.019
ALSO DIFFERENT THAT -- SET TO

01:40:26.086 --> 01:40:27.588
THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE

01:40:27.654 --> 01:40:29.523
IS HOW MANY TIMES CAN PEOPLE

01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:33.427
ACCESS -- MONEY FROM THEIR CHECK

01:40:33.494 --> 01:40:38.365
AND AND THE IDEA WAS TO ALLOW

01:40:38.432 --> 01:40:40.200
THEM.

01:40:40.267 --> 01:40:41.335
TO THE THE THE ISSUE WAS THEY

01:40:41.402 --> 01:40:41.969
CAN USE IT EVERY DAY IF THEY

01:40:42.035 --> 01:40:43.103
WANT TO WRITE THEY CAN TAKE OUT

01:40:43.170 --> 01:40:44.271
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

01:40:44.338 --> 01:40:45.973
AND WHAT WE WANTED TO DO IS KIND

01:40:46.039 --> 01:40:47.908
OF SET SOME GUARDRAILS AROUND IT

01:40:47.975 --> 01:40:48.509
SO THAT WE CAN GET SOME GOOD

01:40:48.575 --> 01:40:49.943
DATA ABOUT HOW PEOPLE ARE USING

01:40:50.010 --> 01:40:52.446
IT -- AND TO ANSWER.

01:40:52.513 --> 01:40:54.248
MR GRAYSON'S A QUESTION IS THAT

01:40:54.314 --> 01:40:55.616
THERE IS NO MONITORING BECAUSE

01:40:55.682 --> 01:40:57.050
WE DON'T HAVE A SYSTEM IT'S THE

01:40:57.117 --> 01:40:58.452
REASON THAT THIS BILL WAS

01:40:58.519 --> 01:41:02.089
PROPOSED -- AND AND SO NOT

01:41:02.156 --> 01:41:04.057
EVERYBODY WILL CHARGE FIFTEEN

01:41:04.124 --> 01:41:07.361
AND AND SOME CHARGE PER MONTH

01:41:07.428 --> 01:41:12.533
SOME CHARGEPER EVENTS AND

01:41:12.599 --> 01:41:13.901
BANDAIDS X. M..

01:41:13.967 --> 01:41:15.035
EXTRACTION OF MONEY -- OUT OF

01:41:15.102 --> 01:41:17.538
THEIR CHECK AND SO WEAK IF WE

01:41:17.604 --> 01:41:18.872
BASICALLY AGREED THE FIFTEEN

01:41:18.939 --> 01:41:21.175
DOLLARS WAS -- WAS THE MAX THAT

01:41:21.241 --> 01:41:23.911
WE THOUGHT WAS APPROPRIATE SOME

01:41:23.977 --> 01:41:27.114
OF THE THE LENDER AT NIGHT IT'S

01:41:27.181 --> 01:41:30.451
NOT ALONE SOME OF THE COMPANIES.

01:41:30.517 --> 01:41:32.352
CHARGE YOU EXTRA IF YOU WANT THE

01:41:32.419 --> 01:41:34.221
MONEY [inaudible]

01:41:34.288 --> 01:41:36.790
EXPEDITED AND OTHERWISE IT

01:41:36.857 --> 01:41:38.358
THERE'S A TURN AROUND THAT THAT

01:41:38.425 --> 01:41:40.794
MAY BE A COUPLE OF DAYS AND SO

01:41:40.861 --> 01:41:42.729
WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

01:41:42.796 --> 01:41:44.198
CAPTURED.

01:41:44.264 --> 01:41:46.467
THAT CHARGES WILD SO IF YOU ADD

01:41:46.533 --> 01:41:48.802
EVERYTHING UP IT CAN'T BE MORE

01:41:48.869 --> 01:41:49.870
THAN FIFTEEN DOLLARS SO IF YOU.

01:41:49.937 --> 01:41:51.104
IN DESPERATE NEED OF YOUR MONEY

01:41:51.171 --> 01:41:52.873
AS IN TODAY OR TOMORROW AND

01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:54.475
YOU'RE WILLING TO PAY THE EXTRA

01:41:54.541 --> 01:41:55.375
SEVEN DOLLARS AND NINETY FIVE

01:41:55.442 --> 01:41:57.544
CENTS -- THEN TOWED AT THE TOTAL

01:41:57.611 --> 01:41:58.812
AMOUNT CAN'T BE MORE THAN

01:41:58.879 --> 01:42:00.380
FIFTEEN DOLLARS BUT GENERALLY

01:42:00.447 --> 01:42:01.682
SPEAKING I THINK MOST OF THEM

01:42:01.748 --> 01:42:03.817
CHARGE ME MUCH LESS THAN THE

01:42:03.884 --> 01:42:05.686
FIFTEEN DOLLARS -- IT BUT YOU

01:42:05.752 --> 01:42:07.254
MAY YOU MAY HAVE TO PAY EVERY

01:42:07.321 --> 01:42:08.655
TIME YOU TAKE MONEY OUT VERY

01:42:08.722 --> 01:42:09.656
SIMILAR TO LIKE.

01:42:09.723 --> 01:42:12.926

WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK

01:42:23.003 --> 01:42:24.104
AND I ONE THINK I CHEER FOR THE

01:42:24.171 --> 01:42:25.772
HARD WORK AND DILIGENCE IN

01:42:25.839 --> 01:42:28.709

THEIR FRIENDS ABOUT IT SO I

01:42:39.453 --> 01:42:40.487

STARTED WHEN I WAS LIVING IN

01:42:48.061 --> 01:42:49.696
CINCINNATI OHIO WE DO IT TODAY

01:42:49.763 --> 01:42:50.764
FOR EMPLOYEES OR FIFTY THOUSAND

01:42:50.831 --> 01:42:51.398

DOES WHAT IS CALLED DIRECT TO

01:42:59.373 --> 01:42:59.973
CONSUMER MANY COMPANIES

01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:01.341
PROMOTERS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES

01:43:01.408 --> 01:43:03.076
OKAY SO THEY WOULD TELL THEIR

01:43:03.143 --> 01:43:04.311
EMPLOYEES WITH POSTERS IN THE

01:43:04.378 --> 01:43:05.646
BREAK ROOM AND THINGS LIKE THAT

01:43:05.712 --> 01:43:06.680

OKAY THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK

01:43:08.715 --> 01:43:10.083
YOU FOR THIS I I PROBABLY I

01:43:10.150 --> 01:43:11.084
THINK I'VE BEEN ON THIS

01:43:11.151 --> 01:43:12.953
COMMITTEE LONGER THAN ANYONE --

01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:15.122
SITTING HERE AND THIS IS ALL

01:43:15.188 --> 01:43:17.658
BEEN AN ONGOING CHALLENGE AND A

01:43:17.724 --> 01:43:19.826
AN UNBELIEVABLE CHALLENGE WITH

01:43:19.893 --> 01:43:21.695
REGARDS TO PAYDAY LOANS AND ALL

01:43:21.762 --> 01:43:23.497
THE OTHER KINDS OF THINGS AND AS

01:43:23.564 --> 01:43:24.731
I LOOK AT THIS I REALIZE THAT

01:43:24.798 --> 01:43:26.266
THIS IS NOT PERFECT IF IT WERE

01:43:26.333 --> 01:43:28.068
PERFECT -- PROBABLY WOULD HAVE

01:43:28.135 --> 01:43:29.403
DONE IT LONG TIME AGO.

01:43:29.469 --> 01:43:31.939
BUT ITREQUIRES OBVIOUSLY A LOT

01:43:32.005 --> 01:43:34.074
OF INPUT AND IT HAS THUS FAR IN

01:43:34.141 --> 01:43:35.642
TERMS OF ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS

01:43:35.709 --> 01:43:37.177
THAT HAVE BEEN THERE AND WE CAN

01:43:37.244 --> 01:43:37.778
PROBABLY PICK THIS THING TO

01:43:37.844 --> 01:43:38.645
DEATH.

01:43:38.712 --> 01:43:40.380
BETWEEN WHETHER IT'S FIFTEEN

01:43:40.447 --> 01:43:42.449
DOLLARS OR FIVE OR SEVEN EVERY

01:43:42.516 --> 01:43:43.584
OTHER WEEK.

01:43:43.650 --> 01:43:44.818
OR YOU KNOW WHETHER IT WOULD

01:43:44.885 --> 01:43:46.386
HAVE TO GET 250% OF WHATEVER

01:43:46.453 --> 01:43:47.955
UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DON'T WANT

01:43:48.021 --> 01:43:49.323
FIFTY BECAUSE I THINK IF YOU

01:43:49.389 --> 01:43:51.058
TAKE ALL YOUR MONEY OUT --

01:43:51.124 --> 01:43:52.726
YOU'RE AT ZERO AND THEN YOU

01:43:52.793 --> 01:43:53.760
MIGHT NEED SOMEBODY THE NEXT

01:43:53.827 --> 01:43:54.828
WEEK YOU HAVEN'T EARNED ANY YET

01:43:54.895 --> 01:43:56.129
I MEAN YOU KNOW I CAN SEE ALL

01:43:56.196 --> 01:43:57.230
THESE THINGS OCCURRING.

01:43:57.297 --> 01:43:58.966
AND I KNOW WE TRY TO DO OUR BEST

01:43:59.032 --> 01:44:00.067
TO TRY TO PROTECT EVERYBODY

01:44:00.133 --> 01:44:01.435
WHICH WE KNOW WOULD NOT ABLE TO

01:44:01.501 --> 01:44:02.502
DO BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S GROWN

01:44:02.569 --> 01:44:03.971
OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE

01:44:04.037 --> 01:44:05.505
DECISIONS BUT THEY DON'T SELL WE

01:44:05.572 --> 01:44:06.707
WE UNDERSTAND THAT.

01:44:06.773 --> 01:44:08.308
TOO SO WE FIND OURSELVES IN THIS

01:44:08.375 --> 01:44:10.110
VERY DIFFICULT POSITION OF

SURE THAT FOLKS ARE JUST

01:44:17.117 --> 01:44:19.620
DEVASTATED BY THESE AGENCIES IN

01:44:19.686 --> 01:44:21.221
WITH A LACK OF RESOURCES AND NOT

01:44:21.288 --> 01:44:22.556
ABLE TO DO VERY MUCH SO.

I THINK THE FACT THAT IT HAS A

01:44:49.349 --> 01:44:50.250
SUNSET OF THREE YEARS WILL GIVE

01:44:50.317 --> 01:44:50.951

BECAUSE I CAN SEE THAT -- WE'RE

01:48:57.831 --> 01:49:00.767
GONNA LOSE COMMITTEE MEMBERS BUT

01:49:00.834 --> 01:49:02.302
AT THE IT IS THAT THE STATE OF

01:49:02.369 --> 01:49:03.770
CALIFORNIA REGULATES ALL

01:49:03.837 --> 01:49:06.306
FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS AND THEY

01:49:06.373 --> 01:49:07.841
DO IT IN A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:49:07.908 --> 01:49:10.710
THAT PERSON IS IS LICENSED.

01:49:10.777 --> 01:49:12.412
THE TO DOING THAT TRANSACTION

01:49:12.479 --> 01:49:13.947
THAT THEY ARE LIVING UP TO THE

01:49:14.014 --> 01:49:15.181
HIGHEST.

01:49:15.248 --> 01:49:17.617
STANDARDS WHICH ARE ETHICAL AND

01:49:17.684 --> 01:49:20.887

THAT THE STATE'S PUT ON IT THIS

01:49:22.155 --> 01:49:24.124
IS THIS IS A NEW PRODUCT THAT

01:49:24.190 --> 01:49:26.126
HAS COME OUT THAT HERE TOO FOR

01:49:26.192 --> 01:49:28.228
HAS NOT BEEN PART OF THE OF THAT.

01:49:28.295 --> 01:49:31.398
UP REGULATORY OVERSIGHT SO -- SO

01:49:31.464 --> 01:49:32.599
THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS

01:49:32.666 --> 01:49:34.401
OVERSIGHT WAS CONCERNED THERE

01:49:34.467 --> 01:49:36.636
THE REGULATORY AGENCY THAT OB

01:49:36.703 --> 01:49:38.004
THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS

01:49:38.071 --> 01:49:39.639
HAPPENING IN THIS SPACE AND SO

01:49:39.706 --> 01:49:40.640
THEY HAD.

01:49:40.707 --> 01:49:42.609
A NUMBER OF DISCUSSIONS AND SAID

01:49:42.676 --> 01:49:44.411
WE REALLY THINK THAT IT'S BEST

01:49:44.477 --> 01:49:46.179
IF YOU'RE REGULATED BECAUSE THEN

01:49:46.246 --> 01:49:48.381
YOU CAN DO REPORTING TO US AND

IS -- LIVING UP TO THE HIGHEST

01:49:52.118 --> 01:49:53.787
STANDARDS POSSIBLE AND SO THAT'S

01:49:53.853 --> 01:49:55.088
THE REASON THAT WE'RE HAVING

01:49:55.155 --> 01:49:56.589
THIS DISCUSSION IS BECAUSE THE

01:49:56.656 --> 01:49:58.124

GETTING GOOD VALUE FOR THEIR

01:50:05.031 --> 01:50:07.000
MONEY AND WHETHER IT WORKS WELL

01:50:07.067 --> 01:50:08.401
AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

01:50:08.468 --> 01:50:09.669
IS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE TAKING

01:50:09.736 --> 01:50:10.837
INTO CONSIDERATION ALL THE

01:50:10.904 --> 01:50:12.238
DIFFERENT PRODUCTS PRODUCTS THAT

01:50:12.305 --> 01:50:16.843
ARE HERE AND THAT'S THE REASON

01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:17.010

01:50:17.077 --> 01:50:18.111
BILL IS BEFORE YOU.

I THINK THAT THE CONVERSATIONS

01:52:47.060 --> 01:52:47.727
HAVE GENERATED.

01:52:47.794 --> 01:52:49.896
A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS

AGREEMENT THAT.

01:53:04.410 --> 01:53:06.946
THERE ARE BAD PRODUCTS THAT HURT

THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND

01:53:09.282 --> 01:53:11.117
THAT THIS IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO

THOSE BAD PRODUCTS AND SO I I

01:53:12.752 --> 01:53:14.687
JUST IT'S NOT LOST ON ME THAT I

01:53:14.754 --> 01:53:16.723
HAVE NOT HEARD ANYONE ARGUE THAT

01:53:16.789 --> 01:53:18.558
IN THIS COMMITTEE ON ANY SIDE OF

01:53:18.625 --> 01:53:21.928
THIS ISSUE -- AND I THINK IT'S

01:53:21.995 --> 01:53:23.696
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHERE

01:53:23.763 --> 01:53:25.632
THIS COULD BE GOING THIS IS

01:53:25.698 --> 01:53:29.602
INDEED A NEW PRODUCT AND NEW.

01:53:29.669 --> 01:53:32.172
CAR CONCEPT OF HOW WE GIVE FOLKS

01:53:32.238 --> 01:53:36.476
ACCESS TO CAPITAL -- BUT IT HAS

01:53:36.543 --> 01:53:39.145
A NUMBER OF GUARD RAILS IN IT

01:53:39.212 --> 01:53:40.680
THAT DIDN'T EXIST SO WHEN IT

01:53:40.747 --> 01:53:42.682

GUARD RAILS OR COMPLETELY WITH

01:53:50.823 --> 01:53:52.392
OUR CARD BILLS AND I THINK THAT

01:53:52.458 --> 01:53:53.826

01:53:53.893 --> 01:53:56.329
