00:37:16.634 --> 00:37:18.836
VEHICLES AND CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN

00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:21.172
A LEADER IN DOING THAT- AS THE

00:37:21.238 --> 00:37:22.873
AUTHOR MENTIONED WE HAVE THE LOW

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.542
CARBON FUEL STANDARD WHICH IS

00:37:24.609 --> 00:37:25.676
STARTING TO HAVE SOME MAJOR

00:37:25.743 --> 00:37:27.778
SUCCESS. IN INTRODUCING

00:37:27.845 --> 00:37:29.680
ALTERNATIVES TO PETROLEUM BASED

00:37:29.747 --> 00:37:32.950
FUELS AND THIS BILL AS SHE SAID

00:37:33.017 --> 00:37:35.219
WOULD REALLY BUILD ON THAT

00:37:35.286 --> 00:37:36.821
SUCCESS AND USE THAT STANDARD AS

00:37:36.887 --> 00:37:39.624
A METRIC. TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:41.792
BECAUSE WE KNOW WE NEED TO DO

00:37:41.859 --> 00:37:42.960
MORE EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW WE'RE

00:37:43.027 --> 00:37:44.395
WE'RE DOING MORE THAN OTHER

00:37:44.462 --> 00:37:46.030
STATES RIGHT NOW STILL NOT

00:37:46.097 --> 00:37:47.231
NEARLY ENOUGH IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:37:47.298 --> 00:37:49.367
MAGNITUDE OF THE CRISES

00:37:49.433 --> 00:37:51.569
PRESENTED BY BOTH AIR POLLUTION.

00:37:51.636 --> 00:37:53.404
AND CLIMATE CHANGE SO THIS BILL

00:37:53.471 --> 00:37:55.806
I THINK TAKES A VERY SENSIBLE

00:37:55.873 --> 00:37:58.743
APPROACH IN INCENTIVIZING THE

00:37:58.809 --> 00:38:01.245
VERY CLEANEST LOW CARBON FUELS

00:38:01.312 --> 00:38:03.447
FOR SIX YEARS SO WILL HAVE A

00:38:03.514 --> 00:38:05.049
TRANSITION UNDER WAY TO ZERO

00:38:05.116 --> 00:38:06.817
EMISSION VEHICLES AND MY

00:38:06.884 --> 00:38:08.386
ORGANIZATION ADVOCATES FOR THAT

00:38:08.452 --> 00:38:10.254
ALL THE TIME BUT WE KNOW THAT

00:38:10.321 --> 00:38:11.956
WHILE THE TRANSITION IS UNDER

00:38:12.023 --> 00:38:13.190
WAY. WE WILL HAVE MILLIONS AND

00:38:13.257 --> 00:38:14.425
MILLIONS OF VEHICLES ON OUR

00:38:14.492 --> 00:38:16.394
ROADS BURNING COMBUSTION FUELS

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.329
AND WE WANT THOSE FUELS TO BE AS

00:38:18.396 --> 00:38:20.164
CLEAN AS POSSIBLE THAT'S WHY WE

00:38:20.231 --> 00:38:23.467
SUPPORT THIS BILL. HOW TO GET IN

00:38:23.534 --> 00:38:24.568
WITH THE COALITION FOR RENEWABLE

00:38:24.635 --> 00:38:25.903
NATURAL GAS OUR MEMBERSHIP IS

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:27.805
MADE UP OF CITIES COUNTIES.

00:38:27.872 --> 00:38:30.174
UNIVERSITIES LABOR UNIONS AND

00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:33.144
COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE FOR- MORE

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:34.979
THAN 95% OF THE RENEWABLE

00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:35.913
NATURAL GAS IN THE UNITED

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.683
STATES- CALIFORNIA'S BAN A WORLD

00:38:38.749 --> 00:38:40.084
LEADER WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE

00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:41.452
CHANGE. BUT WE'VE ALSO BEEN

00:38:41.519 --> 00:38:43.020
VICTIM TO THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE

00:38:43.087 --> 00:38:44.855
CHANGE WHETHER IT'S DROUGHTS

00:38:44.922 --> 00:38:46.457
WILDFIRES TO CONTINUE ABOVE

00:38:51.595 --> 00:38:53.364
ISSUE HEAD ON BY COMMITTING TO

00:38:53.431 --> 00:38:54.598
REDUCING NATURAL GAS TO

00:38:54.665 --> 00:38:56.367
REMISSIONS. COSTLY SEEKING NEW

DOWN AND PUT MORE RESOURCE- TO

STATE- AND IN OUR COUNTRY. FOR

00:39:12.216 --> 00:39:13.517
THESE REASONS AND OTHERS WERE

BIOENERGY ASSOCIATION OF

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.542
CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA

00:39:38.609 --> 00:39:41.812
CHESTER COALITION IN SUPPORT.

00:39:41.879 --> 00:39:43.247
GOOD AFTERNOON RYAN KENNY WITH

00:39:43.314 --> 00:39:45.049

INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OF

00:39:51.322 --> 00:39:54.558
CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT-

00:39:54.625 --> 00:39:56.694
DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN

00:39:56.761 --> 00:40:02.633
OPPOSITION. WE HAVE- COMMENTS OR

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.769
QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE.

00:40:04.835 --> 00:40:07.838
ASSEMBLY MEMBER COURT. SO IN THE

00:40:07.905 --> 00:40:11.842
ANALYSIS- IT SAYS THAT THEY

00:40:11.909 --> 00:40:12.877
DON'T THINK THERE'S REALLY A

00:40:12.943 --> 00:40:14.678
SHORTAGE OF SUPPLIERS SURGED

00:40:14.745 --> 00:40:18.149
PORTAGE SHORTAGE OF USERS. SO

00:40:18.215 --> 00:40:21.519
WHY AND THAT MOST OF THE RESULT

00:40:21.585 --> 00:40:22.686
OF THIS WILL GO TO CURRENT

00:40:22.753 --> 00:40:25.089
SUPPLIERS. THIS DOESN'T MAKE A

00:40:25.156 --> 00:40:27.925
LOT OF SENSE TO ME. ARM I COULD

00:40:27.992 --> 00:40:30.261
SEE A GRANT PROGRAM. TO GET

00:40:30.327 --> 00:40:32.296
MAYBE NEW SUPPLIERS ON IF

00:40:32.363 --> 00:40:34.398
THERE'S SOME BARRIER TO ENTRY

00:40:34.465 --> 00:40:36.734
AND THERE'S EVIDENCE OF THAT-

00:40:36.801 --> 00:40:38.469
MIGHT MAKE MORE SENSE TO SIMPLY

00:40:38.536 --> 00:40:44.608
DO SUBSIDIZE THE- PURCHASE OF-

00:40:44.675 --> 00:40:47.478
ALTERNATIVE ENERGY VEHICLES. SO

00:40:47.545 --> 00:40:50.414
WHY USE THIS APPROACH. AND THANK

00:40:50.481 --> 00:40:52.216
YOU FOR THAT THAT QUESTION

00:40:52.283 --> 00:40:55.085
ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK AT SU THE

00:40:55.152 --> 00:40:57.855
AS PRIMARY DRIVER FOR WHY DIESEL

00:40:57.922 --> 00:41:01.125
REMAINS THE DOMINANT FUEL IN THE

00:41:01.192 --> 00:41:02.726
HEAVY DUTY TRANSPORTATION FACTS

00:41:02.793 --> 00:41:06.630
SECTOR IS COST AND THE REALITY

00:41:06.697 --> 00:41:08.933
IS WE ARE NOT EVER GOING TO GET

00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:11.669
TO A POINT WHERE. THESE FIVE IT

00:41:11.735 --> 00:41:14.672
CLEANER FUELS ARE COST NEUTRAL

00:41:14.738 --> 00:41:16.540
WITH DIESEL WE'RE JUST NOT AND

00:41:16.607 --> 00:41:18.709
SO BY PROVIDING THIS AS AN

00:41:18.776 --> 00:41:21.879
INCENTIVE TO SUPPLIERS THE

00:41:21.946 --> 00:41:24.148
EXPECTATION AND THE GOAL IS IT

00:41:24.215 --> 00:41:26.317
THEN THAT CAN CREATE MORE ELEVEN

00:41:26.383 --> 00:41:28.219
LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WITH THE

00:41:28.285 --> 00:41:31.088
PRICING OF DIESEL AND THAT. IF

00:41:31.155 --> 00:41:32.723
YOU SAID THAT THE IF THE

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:34.859
CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW IS WITH

00:41:34.925 --> 00:41:36.827
DEMAND WE'VE GOT TO MANAGE TO

00:41:36.894 --> 00:41:38.195
LOWER THE PRICE FOR THESE FUEL

00:41:38.262 --> 00:41:40.030
SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY BE

00:41:40.097 --> 00:41:41.632
COST COMPETITIVE WITH DIESEL AND

00:41:41.699 --> 00:41:43.801
WELCOME WITH MY WHAT ABOUT WHEN

00:41:43.868 --> 00:41:46.604
AT ANYTHING TO THAT- LET ME JUST

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:49.506
SAY. GANYMEDE ANALYSIS PRICES

00:41:49.573 --> 00:41:51.709
SET BY SUPPLY AND DEMAND. WE'VE

00:41:51.775 --> 00:41:54.311
DISCUSSED FOR EXAMPLE SUSPENDING

00:41:54.378 --> 00:41:56.513
THE GAS TAX AND PEOPLE SAID.

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:57.915
WHO'S YOU KNOW PRICES SET BY

00:41:57.982 --> 00:42:00.184
SUPPLY AND DEMAND THERE'S NO

00:42:00.251 --> 00:42:01.085
GUARANTEE FIVE A HYDROGEN

00:42:01.151 --> 00:42:06.257
VEHICLE. AND AS A CUSTOMER R. I

00:42:06.323 --> 00:42:08.058
GET A DIRECT BENEFIT ACTUALLY

00:42:08.125 --> 00:42:10.127
FULL FUEL IS FREE BUT ONE CAN

00:42:10.194 --> 00:42:14.498
IMAGINE A CASE. WHERE ARM YOU

00:42:14.565 --> 00:42:16.934
KNOW IT'S NOT FREE BUT IT'S AT A

00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:18.636
REDUCED PRICE BUT AGAIN I'M

00:42:18.702 --> 00:42:21.972
VERY. SKEPTICAL THAT THE PRICE

00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:23.607
WILL ACTUALLY CHANGE BECAUSE

00:42:23.674 --> 00:42:24.675
YOU'RE GIVING MONEY TO THE

00:42:24.742 --> 00:42:27.411
PRODUCERS BECAUSE IT'S THE PRICE

00:42:27.478 --> 00:42:29.413
IS NOT BASED ON PRODUCTION COST.

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.614
BASED ON SUPPLY AND DEMAND

00:42:30.681 --> 00:42:31.649
THAT'S WEIGHED MARKETS WORK

00:42:31.715 --> 00:42:33.584
THAT'S FRESHMAN ECONOMICS IN

00:42:33.651 --> 00:42:37.187
COLLEGE. CORRECT THOUGH IN THIS

00:42:37.254 --> 00:42:39.523
CASE IT I GUESS THAT ONE OF THE

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:43.027
REASONS THAT I DEMAND IS. IS AS

00:42:43.093 --> 00:42:45.296
LOW AS IT IS BECAUSE OF THE

00:42:45.362 --> 00:42:49.300
PRICE SO IN ORDER TO IMPACT. THE

00:42:49.366 --> 00:42:50.868
PAST DEMAND SIDE WE HAVE TO

00:42:50.935 --> 00:42:53.304
ADDRESS THE PRICE ELEMENT AND I

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:56.340
THINK THAT- I THINK THAT THE

00:42:56.407 --> 00:42:59.109
REALITY AS WE ARE MOVING TOWARDS

00:42:59.176 --> 00:43:01.946
OUR- GOAL OF CARBON NEUTRALITY

00:43:02.012 --> 00:43:03.881
HERE IN THE STATE AND ALL AND

00:43:03.948 --> 00:43:06.216
ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IS THAT

00:43:06.283 --> 00:43:08.285
AS WE ARE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS

00:43:08.352 --> 00:43:10.821
HERE IS CALIFORNIA. UP ON

00:43:10.888 --> 00:43:12.890
LOWERING DEMAND FOR GAS THAT'S

00:43:12.957 --> 00:43:15.426
ACTUALLY GOOD BECAUSE- THE PRICE

00:43:15.492 --> 00:43:17.094
POINT OF THESE LOWER CAR OF

00:43:17.161 --> 00:43:18.495
THESE HIGHER CARBON FUELS TO

00:43:18.562 --> 00:43:20.497
ACTUALLY GO DOWN AND SO WE HAVE

00:43:20.564 --> 00:43:22.633
TO FIND SOME WAYS TO IMPACT THAT

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.635
IF WE ACTUALLY WANT. TO THEN BE

00:43:24.702 --> 00:43:27.571
ABLE TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON KIND

00:43:27.638 --> 00:43:29.340
OF A GLOBAL SCALE MY ARGUMENT IS

00:43:29.406 --> 00:43:30.741
A BONY IMPACTED BECAUSE THE

00:43:30.808 --> 00:43:32.609
PRICE IS GOING TO BE SPENT BY

00:43:32.676 --> 00:43:35.746
APPLIANCE SUPPLY AND DEMAND. SO

00:43:35.813 --> 00:43:36.747
WAY IT'S ALWAYS SAID. UNLESS YOU

00:43:36.814 --> 00:43:38.849
MAKE A DIFFERENT KIND OF MARKET

00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:40.684
INTERVENTION THIS ISN'T GOING TO

00:43:40.751 --> 00:43:43.087
WORK. THAT'S MY AND THAT'S

00:43:43.153 --> 00:43:44.922
ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE ANALYSIS

00:43:44.989 --> 00:43:48.325
SAYS IN THAT SECTION. ASSEMBLY

00:43:48.392 --> 00:43:49.593
MAN I WOULD JUST ADD YOU KNOW

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:50.661
PARTICULAR YOURSELF WITH A

00:43:50.728 --> 00:43:52.229
HYDROGEN CAR WE HAVE AN

00:43:52.296 --> 00:43:53.630
ABUNDANCE OF HYDROGEN THE COST

00:43:53.697 --> 00:43:55.733
FOR HYDROGEN IS ACTUALLY IN THE

00:43:55.799 --> 00:43:57.768
ROOM THE- TECHNOLOGY THE

00:43:57.835 --> 00:43:59.470
INNOVATION THAT COMES IN THE

00:43:59.536 --> 00:44:01.205
LARGE PART. WITH THIS BILL WILL

00:44:01.271 --> 00:44:02.773
DO IS HELP INCENTIVIZE THAT

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:04.141
INNOVATION SO THAT WE CAN

00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:05.442
CONTINUE TO GET THE FUEL SOURCE

00:44:05.509 --> 00:44:07.211
DIFFERENT FROM. SOME OF THE FUEL

00:44:07.277 --> 00:44:08.812
SOURCES THAT WE HAVE THAT ARE ON

00:44:08.879 --> 00:44:10.681
MORE OF A SCARCITY MODEL AS YOU

00:44:10.748 --> 00:44:13.450
TALK ABOUT. THINGS LIKE HYDROGEN

00:44:13.517 --> 00:44:16.053
THINGS LIKE SOME OF THESE OTHER

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:16.787
ALTERNATIVE FUELS- RENEWABLE

00:44:16.854 --> 00:44:18.255
NATURAL GAS THE PROBLEM WITH

00:44:18.322 --> 00:44:19.857
HYDROGEN IS THERE ISN'T ENOUGH

00:44:19.923 --> 00:44:22.626
SUPPLY. AND THE BEST WAY TO

00:44:22.693 --> 00:44:24.028
SOLVE THAT WOULD BE FOR THE

00:44:24.094 --> 00:44:26.463
STATE TO INVEST IN GETTING A

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:28.332
LARGER SUPPLY WHICH WOULD THEN

00:44:28.399 --> 00:44:30.667
BRING DOWN THE PRICE. BUT JUST

00:44:30.734 --> 00:44:32.302
GIVING MONEY TO PRODUCERS I

00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:33.670
DON'T THINK CHANGES THE PRICE

00:44:33.737 --> 00:44:36.173
THAT'S AGAIN THE ARGUMENT IN THE

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.975
ANALYSIS AND I AGREE WITH THAT.

00:44:38.042 --> 00:44:39.209
THE BETTER THING TO DO IF

00:44:39.276 --> 00:44:41.078
THERE'S REALLY IF IT'S TOO

00:44:41.145 --> 00:44:43.814
EXPENSIVE AND WHAT YOU WANT IS.

00:44:43.881 --> 00:44:45.849
INNOVATION THEN SUBSIDIZE THE

00:44:45.916 --> 00:44:50.087
INNOVATION. SUBSIDIZE SAY GOING

00:44:50.154 --> 00:44:51.655
TO A LARGER SCALE THAT WOULD BE

00:44:51.722 --> 00:44:53.657
VERY IMPORTANT FOR HYDROGEN.

00:44:53.724 --> 00:44:55.793
WHICH I KNOW QUITE WELL. THEIR

00:44:55.859 --> 00:44:58.762
BIG PROBLEM IS YOU REALLY. HAVE

00:44:58.829 --> 00:45:00.798
A HUGE CAPITAL INVESTMENT. YOU

00:45:00.864 --> 00:45:03.233

FALLING INTO POVERTY IMMEDIATELY

BECAUSE THE INABILITY OF THE

00:49:52.422 --> 00:49:54.491
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ACT. ON

00:49:54.558 --> 00:49:56.793
THE LARGEST ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.929
THAT WE'VE HAD WHICH IS- THE

00:49:58.995 --> 00:49:59.863
ABILITY TO INCREASE THE CHILD

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:01.398

00:50:01.465 --> 00:50:02.199
PROPOSING IS THE ABILITY TO

00:50:09.806 --> 00:50:10.941
CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA BE IN A

00:50:11.007 --> 00:50:13.343
POSITION TO BE ABLE TO AUGMENT

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:14.745
WHAT WE NOW HAVE THE YOUNG CHILD

00:50:14.811 --> 00:50:16.813

BETWEEN ZERO. TO FIVE YEARS OLD-

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:21.451
BUT THIS REALLY WOULD BE A GAME

00:50:21.518 --> 00:50:23.687
CHANGER BECAUSE WE'VE NOT HAD-

00:50:23.754 --> 00:50:24.788
ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION CHILDREN

00:50:24.855 --> 00:50:26.390

ENVELOPE. AND IDA IN IN THE

00:50:30.527 --> 00:50:31.561
INABILITY OF THE FEDERAL

00:50:31.628 --> 00:50:33.630

00:50:33.697 --> 00:50:35.298

TAXES I THINK IT'S- IT'S

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:04.261

00:51:05.629 --> 00:51:07.097

SUPPLY OF INTERMODAL EQUIPMENT

AND SPACE ON TERMINAL- AND THAT

01:00:47.944 --> 01:00:50.013
DRIVES UP THE COST OF DRUGS OF

01:00:50.079 --> 01:00:52.749

THROUGH OUR PORTS. AT AND SO

01:02:03.252 --> 01:02:04.821
IT'S HUGELY IMPERATIVE THAT WE

01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:06.422
TRY TO TACKLE THESE ISSUES AND

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:08.291
WE DO HAVE. A PACKAGE OF BILLS

01:02:08.357 --> 01:02:09.826
ARE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW BUT WE

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:11.260

CONSUMER SPENDING HABITS- THIS

01:02:16.933 --> 01:02:18.367
IS BANNED REALLY I'M ACUTELY

01:02:18.434 --> 01:02:19.168
FELT BUYER CALIFORNIA

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:21.437
AGRICULTURAL EXPORTERS- AND SO

01:02:21.504 --> 01:02:23.806
FOR US. THAT'S A HUGE IMPORTANT-

01:02:23.873 --> 01:02:25.741
PIECE THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

01:02:25.808 --> 01:02:26.943
PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO

01:02:27.009 --> 01:02:28.010
INCENTIVES AND GETTING

01:02:28.077 --> 01:02:28.845
INTERMODAL EQUIPMENT WE

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:29.846
UNDERSTAND THAT THE CONGESTION

01:02:29.912 --> 01:02:31.180
THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. IS

01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:32.315
NOT ALLOWING FOR THE EXPERT

01:02:32.381 --> 01:02:33.883
COMMUNITY TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:35.518
CHAIN MANY CONTAINERS- AND

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:37.286
DIFFERENT EQUIPMENT ARE. BEING

01:02:37.353 --> 01:02:38.721
SHIPPED RIGHT BACK TO ASIA AND

01:02:38.788 --> 01:02:40.289
OTHER PLACES BECAUSE IT'S JUST

01:02:40.356 --> 01:02:41.724
CHEAPER AND MORE EFFICIENT TO DO

01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:43.893
THAT. SO THIS BILL CREATES TO

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.862
TAX CREDITS TO INCENTIVIZE I GOT

01:02:45.928 --> 01:02:46.929

01:02:46.996 --> 01:02:48.464
INCLUDING AT THE CARGO CREDIT

THE MOVE OF INTERMODAL EQUIPMENT

01:02:52.401 --> 01:02:53.870
FROM STORAGE TO AN EXPORTER. SO

01:02:53.936 --> 01:02:54.637
WE THINK THAT'S REALLY GONNA

01:02:54.704 --> 01:02:56.372
HELP THE EXPORTERS ARE KIND OF

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:58.407

REALLY IMPORTANT TO US AND IT'S

01:03:03.312 --> 01:03:06.282
A PRIORITY AND WE THINK THIS

01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:06.916

PORTS- SUBSIDIZING THAT WAY

01:04:40.643 --> 01:04:43.112

01:04:50.786 --> 01:04:52.521
SIDE THAT WE WERE TRYING TO

01:04:52.588 --> 01:04:53.889
ADDRESS THAT THROUGH A SEPARATE

01:04:53.956 --> 01:04:54.924
TAX CREDIT THAT'S MISTRUST

01:04:54.991 --> 01:04:57.560
ALMOST TAX CREDIT PROPOSAL- ON

01:04:57.627 --> 01:04:59.095
THIS ONE VERY SPECIFIC WHEN THE

01:04:59.161 --> 01:05:00.796
DOLLAR FIFTY THAT'S NOT

01:05:00.863 --> 01:05:01.364
CONTAINER SPECIFIC THAT'S ON

01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:04.567
TONNAGE- AND SO THAT'S INTENDED

01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:07.637
TO HELP. DEFRAY THE FOCUS OF ALL

01:05:07.703 --> 01:05:08.671
OF THIS TONNAGE IN OUR CONTAINER

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:10.439
COMMUNITY. MAKE IT MORE

01:05:10.506 --> 01:05:11.941
ACCESSIBLE FOR PORTS LIKE. THE

01:05:12.008 --> 01:05:14.010
PORT OF STOCKTON- PORT HUENEME

01:05:14.076 --> 01:05:15.945
ME PORTS INDIGO THAT AREN'T

01:05:16.012 --> 01:05:18.180
CONTAINERIZED FOCUS BUT PROVIDE

01:05:18.247 --> 01:05:19.782
MORE ACCESS AND AN INTERMODAL

01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:21.484
OPPORTUNITY THOUGH I SEE YOU'RE

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:23.686
NOT CONTAINER. THERE'S A SECOND

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:25.521
COMPONENT OF THIS WHICH IS THE

01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:26.722
SECOND ONE IS SPECIFIC TO

01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:30.393
CONTAINER ACCESS LAWS- AND- BUT

01:05:30.459 --> 01:05:32.561
THAT DOLLAR FIFTY PER TONNAGE IS

01:05:32.628 --> 01:05:34.096
ONLY BASED ON YOUR ADDITIONAL

01:05:34.163 --> 01:05:37.266
TIME SO YOU DON'T GET PAID FOR

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:37.933
YOUR BASELINE TONNAGE. YOU ONLY

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.402
GET PAID FOR THE ADDITIONAL

01:05:39.468 --> 01:05:42.171
AMOUNT OVER THE PRIOR YEAR- AND

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:43.873
SO IS INTENDED TO ONLY OFFSET-

01:05:43.939 --> 01:05:46.709
SO IT'S REDUCING THE COSTS FOR

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:48.811
WHO THE PORT FOR THE ACTUAL

01:05:48.878 --> 01:05:50.646
EXPORTER THE ACTUAL EXPORTER THE

01:05:50.713 --> 01:05:53.683
CARGO HONOR SO. WHAT HAPPENS SO

01:05:53.749 --> 01:05:55.084
BASICALLY STOCKTON ISN'T

01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:56.952
COMPETITIVE. IS THAT THE

01:05:57.019 --> 01:05:58.954
PROBLEM. STOCKTON IS VERY

01:05:59.021 --> 01:06:02.124
COMPETITIVE- FOR THE CARGOES

01:06:02.191 --> 01:06:03.159
THAT STOCKTON HAS ALWAYS BEEN

01:06:03.225 --> 01:06:05.061
COMPETITIVE FOR. IT'S NOT

01:06:05.127 --> 01:06:06.796
NECESSARILY COST COMPETITIVE

01:06:06.862 --> 01:06:08.130
COMPARED TO THE CONTAINERIZED

01:06:08.197 --> 01:06:10.766
EXPORT TRADE RIGHT- AND WHAT

01:06:10.833 --> 01:06:12.902
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS BROUGHT IN

01:06:12.968 --> 01:06:16.372
THE- THE ACTUAL BASE. SO YOU'RE

01:06:16.439 --> 01:06:18.641
OUT OF THE VERYPLACE WHERE A

01:06:18.708 --> 01:06:23.412
LOT OF EXPORTERS FIND THEMSELVES. NOW WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE

01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:25.081
OPTIONS- AND- THIS THAT'S ONE

01:06:25.147 --> 01:06:26.449
COMPONENT OF IT. THE OTHER

01:06:26.515 --> 01:06:28.384
COMPONENT OF IT OF ACCESS IS THE

01:06:28.451 --> 01:06:30.286
SECOND ONE WHICH IS WE HAVE A

01:06:30.353 --> 01:06:32.455
GLUT OF EMPTY CONTAINERS IN

01:06:32.521 --> 01:06:34.490
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RIGHT. AND

01:06:34.557 --> 01:06:36.559
WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH INTO

01:06:36.625 --> 01:06:38.160
CONTAINERS IN PLACES WHERE

01:06:38.227 --> 01:06:39.495
PEOPLE WANT TO EXPORT WITH THEM

01:06:39.562 --> 01:06:41.063
PRIMARILY IN CENTRAL AND

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:42.898
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE ACTUAL

01:06:42.965 --> 01:06:45.501
REPOSITIONING COSTS TO GET A

01:06:45.568 --> 01:06:46.802
QUICK MEN OUT OF SOUTHERN

01:06:46.869 --> 01:06:47.870
CALIFORNIA INTO CENTRAL VALLEY

01:06:47.937 --> 01:06:49.872
IS A NEW COSTS THAT WAS NOT

01:06:49.939 --> 01:06:52.007
ACCOUNTED FOR BY PEOPLE PREPEND

01:06:52.074 --> 01:06:54.577
EMIC I'D ALWAYS HAD A- A LOT OF

01:06:54.643 --> 01:06:55.544
ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT AND

01:06:55.611 --> 01:06:57.947
CONTAINERS AVAILABLE. YOU COULD

01:06:58.013 --> 01:06:59.215
PICK ONE UP ANYONE TIME YOU

01:06:59.281 --> 01:07:02.218
WANTED- IT WAS NOT VERY COSTLY.

01:07:02.284 --> 01:07:03.853
NOW THEY'RE VERY COSTL THEY'RE

01:07:03.919 --> 01:07:05.121
OUT OF POSITION AND EVEN THE

01:07:05.187 --> 01:07:06.021
COST OF THE ACTUAL

01:07:06.088 --> 01:07:07.156
TRANSPORTATION HIGHER SO

01:07:07.223 --> 01:07:08.624
THERE'S- MORE DEMAND FOR

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:11.160
TRUCKING ALL OF THAT- ASSOCIATED

01:07:11.227 --> 01:07:13.696
WITH IT SO THE SO THIS WOULD BE

01:07:13.763 --> 01:07:15.231
BASICALLY SUBSIDIZE SUBSIDY FOR

01:07:15.297 --> 01:07:15.765
BRINGING CONTAINERS FROM

01:07:15.831 --> 01:07:17.266
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO NORTHERN

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:20.136
CALIFORNIA. IN YEAH ANY OF THOSE

01:07:20.202 --> 01:07:21.904
REPOSITIONING IS BUT THAT'S THE

01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:24.273
PRIMARY ONE. OKAY AND THAT WOULD

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:25.841
BE ENOUGH TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE

01:07:25.908 --> 01:07:27.710
THE DOLLAR FIFTY. WE LOVE THAT

01:07:27.777 --> 01:07:30.279
BACK CREDIT IS KEEN ON A THIRTY

01:07:30.346 --> 01:07:32.848
DOLLAR MOVE WE ACTUALLY DO

01:07:32.915 --> 01:07:34.884
BELIEVE THAT THAT WILL HELP-

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:37.987
OFFSET SOME OF THOSE COSTS- THAT

01:07:38.053 --> 01:07:39.555
THE TRUCKING MARKET IS YOU KNOW

01:07:39.622 --> 01:07:41.857
IS VERY VOLATILE SPOT PRICES ARE

01:07:41.924 --> 01:07:44.593
ALL OVER THE PLACE- BUT- WHEN WE

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:46.796
LOOK AT THE MARKETPLACE ITSELF

01:07:46.862 --> 01:07:49.131
WHAT WE DID WAS WE- CAME TO

01:07:49.198 --> 01:07:51.901
THAT. DOLLAR FIGURE- BY

01:07:51.967 --> 01:07:53.536
ESTIMATING HOW MANY ADDITIONAL

01:07:53.602 --> 01:07:54.703
PIECES OF EQUIPMENT MIGHT

01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:56.038
POTENTIALLY HAVE AVAILABLE

01:07:56.105 --> 01:07:58.574
WITHIN THE THRESHOLD- WE SET A

01:07:58.641 --> 01:08:00.576
THRESHOLD IN THIS BILL SO THE

01:08:00.643 --> 01:08:03.179
LEGISLATURE CAN CHANGE THAT-

01:08:03.245 --> 01:08:04.146
DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS BUT

01:08:04.213 --> 01:08:05.481
THAT'S ONE OF THE CONTROLS IN

01:08:05.548 --> 01:08:06.582
HERE TOO THAT IT'S LIMITED BY

01:08:06.649 --> 01:08:08.517
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S

01:08:08.584 --> 01:08:09.618
APPROPRIATED IN THE BILL OR NOW

01:08:09.685 --> 01:08:12.655
I UNDERSTAND A LOT BETTER. ARM

01:08:12.721 --> 01:08:13.923
SO THE CONTAINERS ARE BEING

01:08:13.989 --> 01:08:15.558
MOVED UP HOW WOULD THIS AFFECT

01:08:15.624 --> 01:08:17.026
US SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN

01:08:17.092 --> 01:08:21.197
OAKLAND. WHAT PRIMARILY ON THE

01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:24.066
EXPORT SIDE- WE BELIEVE THAT IT

01:08:24.133 --> 01:08:27.136
WOULD IT WOULD BENEFIT OAKLAND-

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:31.273
STOCKTON AND- WHERE SACRAMENTO-

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:33.042

EXPORTS ON WITH RESPECT TO

01:08:33.909 --> 01:08:35.478
MANUFACTURING EXPORTS WE THINK

01:08:35.544 --> 01:08:37.446
THAT IT WOULDN'T WOULD AFFECT

01:08:37.513 --> 01:08:38.414
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PORTS

01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:42.418

WHEN I CAN BE SUPPORT OR NOT

01:08:48.257 --> 01:08:49.692

ISSUES- EVERYONE IS HYPER AWARE

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:18.320
OF THIS. AND I THINK WHAT WE

01:09:18.387 --> 01:09:20.189
STRUGGLE WITH IS LIKE THE SCALE

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:22.391
OF THIS AND I THINK DOCTOR COURT

01:09:22.458 --> 01:09:24.126
GRAYSON INTERESTING ISSUE ABOUT

01:09:24.193 --> 01:09:26.161

01:09:30.733 --> 01:09:32.434
CHALLENGE WHAT WHAT DOES IT LOOK

01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:34.970
LIKE WHAT WHAT ARE WE KIND OF

01:09:35.037 --> 01:09:36.639
PROJECTING OUT- THE CHALLENGE OF

01:09:36.705 --> 01:09:38.707
MOVING THESE GOODS WILL BE ART

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:41.977
pTHAT THIS ACTUALLY DOES MAKE AN

01:09:42.044 --> 01:09:43.646
IMPACT WE DON'T DO IT JUST TO DO

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:45.514
IT WE WANTED RIGHT. UNDERSTAND

01:09:45.581 --> 01:09:47.583
THAT RIGHT NOW YEAH IF WE'RE

01:09:47.650 --> 01:09:50.252
TRYING TO REALLY VISUALIZE THE

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:53.556
SCALE- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:09:53.622 --> 01:10:00.129
MILLIONS OF TRANSACTIONS- BUT TO

01:10:00.195 --> 01:10:01.430
MAKE THAT. TANGIBLE FOR YOU KNOW

01:10:01.497 --> 01:10:03.666
TO ACTUALLY BREAK I DOWN TO

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:04.266

ACTUAL WEIGHT OF THE GOODS

01:10:09.071 --> 01:10:10.372
BECAUSE OF THE TWO THINGS THAT

01:10:10.439 --> 01:10:13.242
YOU POTENTIALLY. ARE ALWAYS

01:10:13.309 --> 01:10:15.544
KEEPING TRACK OF- OUTSIDE WITH

01:10:15.611 --> 01:10:18.714

THOUSAND. POUNDS- BUT NOT ALL

01:10:32.328 --> 01:10:35.698

THE ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OVER YOUR

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:43.572
BASE LINE CREDIT- THE CHALLENGE

01:10:43.639 --> 01:10:45.307
OBVIOUSLY IS YOU DON'T WANT TO

01:10:45.374 --> 01:10:47.409
PAY SOMEONE TO DO SOMETHING

01:10:47.476 --> 01:10:48.043

CONSTRAINTS THAT WE HAVE ON THE

SUPPLY CHAIN AND- JUST THE

DEMAND ON ON GOOD SIDE. THEY'RE

01:11:37.593 --> 01:11:38.694
THEY'RE NOT NATURALLY JUST

01:11:56.879 --> 01:11:59.214
OF OUR CONGESTION- AND ON THE

01:11:59.281 --> 01:12:00.816
IMPORT SIDE THAT CROWDS OUT

01:12:00.883 --> 01:12:04.453
IMPORTS- AND SO OUR TOTAL INPUT

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:05.454
IMPORT VALUES HAVE BEEN
