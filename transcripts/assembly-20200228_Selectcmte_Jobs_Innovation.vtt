THAT AS A RESULT OF THAT. YOU

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.322

00:38:11.389 --> 00:38:12.390
NUMBERS I WAS ONLY ABLE TO GET

00:38:12.456 --> 00:38:15.192
THE NUMBERS FROM TWO THOUSAND

00:38:15.259 --> 00:38:15.793
FOURTEEN THROUGH TWO THOUSAND

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.261
SEVENTEEN- BUT TO THE MOTION

00:38:17.328 --> 00:38:18.262
PICTURE INDUSTRY PENSIONS

00:38:18.329 --> 00:38:20.131
PENSION PLAN. AND SIR

00:38:20.197 --> 00:38:23.067
DEMONSTRATES. WHAT TOOK PLACE

00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:28.139
IN THAT IN THAT PERIOD. WE HAD-

00:38:28.205 --> 00:38:29.306
AGAIN A PROCTOR THAT WE SAW A

00:38:29.373 --> 00:38:31.976
DECLINE IN IN HOURS CONTRIBUTED

00:38:32.043 --> 00:38:34.078
TO THESE PLANS ALL THIS IS ONLY

00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:34.979
ONE OF FOUR INDUSTRY PLANS

00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:37.181
RIGHT ACTION ONE OF FIVE

00:38:37.248 --> 00:38:39.183
INDUSTRY PLANS. BUT IT COVERS A

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:41.185
BROAD PROBABLY ABOUT 60% OF ALL

00:38:41.252 --> 00:38:42.987
ALL THE WORK CONTRIBUTIONS

00:38:43.054 --> 00:38:45.056
COMING IN PLACE OF THE POINT ON

00:38:45.122 --> 00:38:47.324
ON CORRECTIONS. AND DURING THAT

00:38:47.391 --> 00:38:51.028
PERIOD WE SAW AN INCREASE.

00:38:51.095 --> 00:38:52.897
HOURS ARE WE COULD DISTRIBUTE

00:38:52.963 --> 00:38:54.331
DIRECTLY TO THOSE TYPES OF

00:38:54.398 --> 00:38:58.002
PROGRAMS FOR PILOTS IT WAS

00:38:58.069 --> 00:39:00.071
THIRTY ONE OF THREE MILLION ONE

00:39:00.137 --> 00:39:03.140
HUNDRED FIFTEEN. HOURS FEATURE

00:39:03.207 --> 00:39:09.213
FILMS WAS. OUR TWO MILLION NINE

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:09.780
HUNDRED AND FIVE HOURS THE

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:11.382
TELEVISION OR WE REALLY SAW THE

JUST ATTRIBUTED TO. THIS

00:39:18.255 --> 00:39:21.258
PROGRAM AND SO I THINK THAT

00:39:21.325 --> 00:39:22.359
DEMONSTRATES HOW IMPORTANT THAT

00:39:22.426 --> 00:39:24.228
IS FOR THE TOTAL NUMBERS IF

00:39:24.295 --> 00:39:27.198

GROWTH TOOK PLACE AS A RESULT

00:40:18.549 --> 00:40:21.185

THE REVERSAL HAPPENED ALMOST

00:41:54.411 --> 00:41:56.347
IMMEDIATELY BY THE TIME PROGRAM

00:41:56.413 --> 00:41:57.581
TWO POINT OH KICKED AND WE WERE

00:41:57.648 --> 00:42:00.117
REALLY COOKING WITH FIRE WE HAD

00:42:00.184 --> 00:42:02.253
OUR GREATEST EVER YEARS FOR ON

00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:04.255
LOCATION PRODUCTION. EVER EVER

00:42:04.321 --> 00:42:08.125
IN 200-016-2017 WAS THE SECOND

00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:11.262
BEST YEAR OF PRODUCTION TWENTY

00:42:11.328 --> 00:42:11.829
EIGHTEEN FELL RIGHT IN LINE

00:42:11.896 --> 00:42:14.231
WITH THAT. VERY INTERESTINGLY

00:42:14.298 --> 00:42:16.400
LAST YEAR AND TWENTY NINETEEN

00:42:16.467 --> 00:42:16.934
WE SAW SMALL DECREASE IN

00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:18.335
PRODUCTION. AND WHEN ASKED

00:42:18.402 --> 00:42:19.270
ABOUT THE REASONS WHY IT

00:42:19.336 --> 00:42:20.404
CERTAINLY ISN'T BECAUSE THERE

00:42:20.471 --> 00:42:21.438
AREN'T WORK OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:42:21.505 --> 00:42:24.208
OUR- OUR ENTERTAINMENT CREWS OR

00:42:24.275 --> 00:42:25.643
CAST. IT'S BECAUSE WE FACE

00:42:25.709 --> 00:42:28.445
CAPACITY ISSUES SO LOS ANGELES

00:42:28.512 --> 00:42:29.346
HAS FILLED TO THE POINT THAT

00:42:29.413 --> 00:42:30.581
CERTAIN KINDS OF PRODUCTION

00:42:30.648 --> 00:42:31.615
HAVE DIFFICULTY MAKING THE

00:42:31.682 --> 00:42:33.150
DECISION TO LOCATE HERE.

00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:35.152
SOUNDSTAGE CAPACITY ESPECIALLY

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:37.488
THE CERTIFIED ONES THAT ARE OF

00:42:37.554 --> 00:42:37.955
GREAT USE TO FEATURE

00:42:38.022 --> 00:42:39.556
PRODUCTION. MANY OF THEM ARE

00:42:39.623 --> 00:42:42.226
OPERATING AT 9698% CAPACITY AND

00:42:42.293 --> 00:42:44.261
THAT MEANS. IF YOU'RE MAKING A

00:42:44.328 --> 00:42:45.396
PRODUCTION DECISION. YOU'RE

00:42:45.462 --> 00:42:47.164

COMPETITION. BUT THERE SIMPLY

00:42:51.535 --> 00:42:53.504

00:42:54.438 --> 00:42:55.673
TO BEAR AN INCREASED LEVEL OF

00:42:55.739 --> 00:42:57.174
PRODUCTION AND CERTAINLY

00:42:57.241 --> 00:42:58.609
INCREASED THE EFFORT WE PUT

00:42:58.676 --> 00:42:59.610
FORTH INTO MAKING SURE

PRODUCTION A SUSTAINABLE IN OUR

00:43:00.544 --> 00:43:01.445

00:43:01.512 --> 00:43:03.480
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS TO BE

00:43:03.547 --> 00:43:04.048

RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT-

00:43:54.999 --> 00:43:56.266

JURISDICTIONS COMPETING WITH

ONE NOT ONLY COMPETING WITH ONE

00:43:59.436 --> 00:44:00.004
ANOTHER WHICH THEY ACTUALLY DO

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:02.940
BUT I'M NOT BEING OF A QUARTER

THAT ALL THAT GETS CALLED NAME

00:44:20.357 --> 00:44:23.027
TRYING TO GATHER WHICH- YOU

00:44:23.093 --> 00:44:24.194

FEEL THAT- WERE KEEPING ARE WE

00:44:42.112 --> 00:44:44.815
LOSING PRODUCTIONS BECAUSE OF

00:44:44.882 --> 00:44:45.616
LACK OF SPACE AND CAPACITY.

00:44:45.682 --> 00:44:47.751
LOOKING TO WHAT EXTENT WILL THE

00:44:47.818 --> 00:44:49.586
SEARCH FOR AVAILABLE STAGE

00:44:49.653 --> 00:44:50.721
SPACE IS NOW A GLOBAL

00:44:50.788 --> 00:44:52.756
PHENOMENON SO WHEN LOOKING FOR

00:44:52.823 --> 00:44:54.625
STAGES THAT CAN SUPPORT A

00:44:54.691 --> 00:44:55.993
LARGER BUDGET FEATURE FILM FOR

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.895
EXAMPLE THAT'S NOT A WORLDWIDE

00:44:57.961 --> 00:44:59.596
SEARCH AND IT'S NOT JUST LOS

00:44:59.663 --> 00:45:00.898
ANGELES IT IS FACING THIS

00:45:00.964 --> 00:45:01.765
CRUNCH PROBLEM IT IS EVERY

00:45:01.832 --> 00:45:02.800
OTHER MAJOR PRODUCTION

00:45:02.866 --> 00:45:04.902
DESTINATION ON THE GLOBE. SO TO

00:45:04.968 --> 00:45:06.703
SOME EXTENT IT MUST BE HAVING

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:09.740
AN EFFECT- BUT TO THE TO THE

00:45:09.807 --> 00:45:11.608
OTHER SIDE OF IT WE DO HAVE

00:45:11.675 --> 00:45:13.077
EXCESS CAPACITY IN THE REGION

00:45:13.143 --> 00:45:15.879
BUT IT'S OF A KIND RIGHT- WE

00:45:15.946 --> 00:45:16.947
TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE STUDIO

00:45:17.014 --> 00:45:18.148
FACILITIES THAT EXIST IN THE

00:45:18.215 --> 00:45:20.050
NORTH- EAST VALLEY AND THERE IS

00:45:20.117 --> 00:45:21.852
ACTUALLY A- PURPOSE BUILT.

00:45:21.919 --> 00:45:23.720
DEDICATED FACILITY IN THE NEW

00:45:23.787 --> 00:45:25.956
QUIXOTE FACILITY- THAT WILL BE

00:45:26.023 --> 00:45:27.291
ABLE TO SUPPORT LARGER BUDGET

00:45:27.357 --> 00:45:28.959
FEATURES. BUT A LOT OF THE

00:45:29.026 --> 00:45:30.727
SPACE THAT IS NOW BEING USED

00:45:30.794 --> 00:45:31.862
FOR PRODUCTION IS ADAPTIVE RE

00:45:31.929 --> 00:45:33.730
USE IT WAS FORMALLY WAREHOUSE

00:45:33.797 --> 00:45:34.731
IT WAS FORMALLY SOME OTHER.

00:45:34.798 --> 00:45:36.867
PURPOSE AND IT IS NOT PURPOSE

00:45:36.934 --> 00:45:38.902
BUILT FOR FILM PRODUCTION IT

00:45:38.969 --> 00:45:40.637
ALSO DOESN'T HAVE THE AVAILABLE

00:45:40.704 --> 00:45:43.740
RESOURCES AROUND IT SUCH AS THE

00:45:43.807 --> 00:45:45.742
STUDIO- SUPPORT SERVICES

00:45:45.809 --> 00:45:46.810
THEY'RE THEY'RE LOCATED IN

00:45:46.877 --> 00:45:48.178
PLACES WHERE THERE SIMPLY ISN'T

00:45:48.245 --> 00:45:50.848
SPACE TO PUT THAT. SO WE HAVE

00:45:50.914 --> 00:45:52.749
THE LARGEST POSSIBLE INVENTORY

00:45:52.816 --> 00:45:54.885
OF ANY OTHER- PRODUCTION CENTER

00:45:54.952 --> 00:45:56.820
IN THE WORLD FIVE POINT SIX

00:45:56.887 --> 00:45:57.888
FIVE POINT THREE MILLION SQUARE

00:45:57.955 --> 00:46:00.891
FEET OF STUDIO SPACE- BUT NOT

00:46:00.958 --> 00:46:01.859
ALL OF IT IS OF THE SAME.

00:46:01.925 --> 00:46:03.093
CALIBER IN QUALITY NOT ALL OF

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.862
IT CAN SUPPORT THE SAME KINDS

00:46:04.928 --> 00:46:05.996
OF PRODUCTION SO IT DEPENDS

00:46:06.063 --> 00:46:08.065
WHAT YOU NEED BACK. IF YOU WANT

00:46:08.132 --> 00:46:08.665
TO BE MORE ATTRACTIVE TO THE

00:46:08.732 --> 00:46:09.833
BIG BUDGET FEATURES WE ARE OUT

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:11.201
OF THAT ROOM AND ARE YOU HAVING

00:46:11.268 --> 00:46:13.770
A SENSE OF HOW MUCH REAL ESTATE

00:46:13.837 --> 00:46:15.906

POWER LINE. AND THEIR LEASE WAS

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:10.988
RECENTLY THREATENED BECAUSE THE

RECEPTIVENESS OF THE STATE ALSO

00:51:20.076 --> 00:51:22.112
CHANGING- BECAUSE IT WAS

DIFFICULT PRIOR TO THAT TO GET

HUMAN COST ISSUE THAT USUALLY

GO DOOR TO DOOR- YOU'LL SEE A

00:51:47.237 --> 00:51:49.139
LOT OF FOLKS WHO ARE EITHER

00:51:49.206 --> 00:51:52.309
ABSENT OR ONE OF THEM IS A WAY

00:51:52.375 --> 00:51:57.013
FOR- AND- THAT'S NOT ANECDOTAL

00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.149
IT'S LITERALLY EVERY OTHER

00:51:59.216 --> 00:52:02.018
HOUSE. AND EVERY OTHER HOUSES A

00:52:02.085 --> 00:52:04.120
REALTOR SPECIALLY IN STUDIO

00:52:04.187 --> 00:52:09.860
CITY. BUT BUT YOU KNOW WHEN

00:52:09.926 --> 00:52:11.862
THERE ARE REPORTS THAT SAY THAT

00:52:11.928 --> 00:52:13.129
ONE THIRD OF THE TAX CREDITS.

00:52:13.196 --> 00:52:18.068
WERE. WENT TO PROJECTS THAT

00:52:18.134 --> 00:52:20.070
COULD HAVE OTHERWISE HAVE STILL

00:52:20.136 --> 00:52:22.873
HAVE ALREADY BEEN IN CALIFORNIA

00:52:22.939 --> 00:52:26.910
SOMETIMES I WHAT I DON'T HEAR.

00:52:26.977 --> 00:52:29.112
BACK IS WELL FIRST OF ALL

00:52:29.179 --> 00:52:31.081
THERE'S AN UNCERTAINTY THAT

00:52:31.147 --> 00:52:34.251
GETS SPOKEN ABOUT BUT- THE FACT

00:52:34.317 --> 00:52:37.988
THAT IT'S KEPT FAMILIES WHOLE.

00:52:38.054 --> 00:52:40.991
AND THAT WE'VE FOR GONE COSTS

00:52:41.057 --> 00:52:43.193
AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT COMES

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:44.094
IN WITH COUNSELING AND THERAPY

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:46.196
AND GOD KNOWS ALL THE OTHER

00:52:46.263 --> 00:52:47.898
COSTS THAT DON'T EVEN GET

00:52:47.964 --> 00:52:50.100
ACCOUNTED FOR. A JUST A FEW

00:52:50.166 --> 00:52:51.301
YEARS AGO WE WERE GOING TO BE

00:52:51.368 --> 00:52:52.903
HOSTING AN INFORMAL HEARING

00:52:52.969 --> 00:52:54.337
ABOUT WHAT THE COST IS ON

00:52:54.404 --> 00:52:57.374
FAMILIES AND THEN INSTEAD WE

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.242
PARTNERED UP WITH- SOME OF THE

00:52:59.309 --> 00:53:02.979
UNIONS- AND- WE HOSTED- JOB

00:53:03.046 --> 00:53:05.015
PLACEMENT. PROGRAM WHICH WAS

00:53:05.081 --> 00:53:06.917
EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL AND WE'VE

00:53:06.983 --> 00:53:08.952
BEEN DOING IT SINCE. BUT I'D I

00:53:09.019 --> 00:53:10.053
DON'T THINK THAT GETS ENOUGH

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.221
COVERAGE AND IT'S A VERY

00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:16.026
DIFFICULT ITEM TO PUT. DOLLARS

00:53:16.092 --> 00:53:18.094
TO. QUANTIFYING THAT IS

00:53:18.161 --> 00:53:19.963
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. BUT I

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:22.065
THINK IT'S CRITICAL FOR US TO

00:53:22.132 --> 00:53:24.134
SPEAK MORE TO THAT AND TRY TO

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:26.269
FIGURE OUT HOW WE- HOW WE CAN

00:53:26.336 --> 00:53:29.039
ASSOCIATE A DOLLAR SIGN TACKED

00:53:29.105 --> 00:53:30.073
TO THAT. ISSUE BECAUSE-

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:32.242
SOMETIMES THE BIGGEST COSTS ARE

00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:33.543
THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T

00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:35.478
REALIZE HOW THEY'RE CREEPING UP

00:53:35.545 --> 00:53:38.214
ON US. WHEN YOU HAVE HEARINGS

00:53:38.281 --> 00:53:39.115
AND HEALTH CARE RIGHT NOW AND

00:53:39.182 --> 00:53:42.118
SEE THAT. POTENTIALLY OF FORCE

00:53:42.185 --> 00:53:44.087
TO A FIFTH OF THE COST GO TO

00:53:44.154 --> 00:53:47.390
INEFFICIENCIES- YOU CAN

00:53:47.457 --> 00:53:50.093
PROBABLY. SAY THAT THAT IS ALSO

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:53.163
AN ERROR THOSE INEFFICIENCIES

00:53:53.229 --> 00:53:54.130
APPLY TO MANY OTHER INDUSTRIES

00:53:54.197 --> 00:53:56.032
AS WELL. AND PART OF THAT IS

00:53:56.099 --> 00:53:58.034
THE HUMAN COST THAT DOES NOT

00:53:58.101 --> 00:54:00.036
GET VALUE FOR. THAT'S SUCH AS

00:54:00.103 --> 00:54:01.171
THE COMMENTS I DO APPRECIATE

00:54:01.237 --> 00:54:03.273
YOU BRING THAT UP I HEARD THAT

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:05.075

00:54:05.141 --> 00:54:08.078
ANECDOTALLY SPEAKING. SEE A LOT

00:54:16.519 --> 00:54:18.254
IT DOESN'T HAVE THE CAPS THAT

00:54:18.321 --> 00:54:20.223
CALIFORNIA HAS. I THINK THAT'S

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:21.291
THAT'S A WORTHWHILE

00:54:21.358 --> 00:54:24.094
CONVERSATION BUT I. HONESTLY

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:26.229
DON'T KNOW WHAT. DIRECTION IT

00:54:26.296 --> 00:54:29.099
SHOULD BE AND BUT CAN YOU

00:54:29.165 --> 00:54:30.333
DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR

01:23:14.789 --> 01:23:15.790
THE ECONOMY AND JOBS THAT WE

01:23:15.857 --> 01:23:17.625
