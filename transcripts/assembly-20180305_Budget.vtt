THE SP TO CLEAN UP LANGUAGE.

00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:50.802 region:rollup2
A. I THINK THAT IT WE WOULD BE

00:42:49.133 --> 00:42:52.904 region:rollup2
UNANIMOUS IN SAYING THAT WE

00:42:50.802 --> 00:42:54.172 region:rollup2
SHOULD NOT HAVE AMBIGUITY AND

00:42:52.904 --> 00:42:55.540 region:rollup2
THAT LANGUAGE AND THERE

00:42:54.172 --> 00:42:56.541 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY WAS AMBIGUITY IN LINE.

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:57.842 region:rollup2
THAT LEGISLATURE PASSED THAT

00:42:56.541 --> 00:42:59.944 region:rollup2
WHAT LAST YEAR SO WE NEED TO

00:42:57.842 --> 00:43:02.613 region:rollup2

APPLIES TO. STATE AND LOCAL

00:43:02.613 --> 00:43:05.817 region:rollup2

00:43:04.749 --> 00:43:07.452 region:rollup2

REQUIRED TO PAY THIS FEE AND I

00:43:10.588 --> 00:43:13.958 region:rollup2

00:43:12.323 --> 00:43:14.992 region:rollup2
THAT THEY SHOULDN'T ANOTHER SOME

00:43:13.958 --> 00:43:17.261 region:rollup2
HISTORICAL PRECEDENT.

00:43:14.992 --> 00:43:18.896 region:rollup2

HYPOCRISY AND. THEY CAN HAVE A

00:43:44.589 --> 00:43:47.925 region:rollup2

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:49.961 region:rollup2
RESPONSE TO THAT IS WHY SHOULD.

00:43:47.925 --> 00:43:51.596 region:rollup2

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.735 region:rollup2
DO THIS LANGUAGE THOSE

00:43:57.201 --> 00:43:59.103 region:rollup2

EXEMPTED IN THAT LAW. ON WE

00:44:04.509 --> 00:44:06.744 region:rollup2
SUBSEQUENTLY HAVE HEARD THAT

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:08.146 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME DISAGREEMENT ON

00:44:06.744 --> 00:44:10.481 region:rollup2
THAT AND SO WE SEEK THIS IS JUST

00:44:08.146 --> 00:44:11.082 region:rollup2
CLARIFYING WHAT WAS OUR INTENT

00:44:10.481 --> 00:44:12.450 region:rollup2
