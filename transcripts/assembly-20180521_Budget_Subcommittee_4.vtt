SO WHAT WHAT WAS THE.

00:45:19.116 --> 00:45:21.752
REQUIREMENT THAT WHY IT CAN'T

00:45:21.819 --> 00:45:23.587
THE WHAT I UNDERSTAND IS THAT

00:45:23.654 --> 00:45:26.256
THE AT THE SUDDEN PUSH NHL.

00:45:26.323 --> 00:45:29.026
EXCEEDS OUT THAT THE SPURS

00:45:29.093 --> 00:45:30.627
HANDLE CAO TO RAINY DAY. AND

00:45:30.694 --> 00:45:32.796
THEN THE US SALES TAX I HAS TO

00:45:32.863 --> 00:45:35.866
BE UP. OF REDUCED OR IS THAT A

00:45:35.933 --> 00:45:38.068
NICE THING NAM TO REFUND AND

00:45:38.135 --> 00:45:39.369
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE. SADDEST

00:45:39.436 --> 00:45:46.143
TAXA ó TO OUR TAXPAYERS WITH

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:46.877
THE GOAL HERE IS TO IS

00:45:46.944 --> 00:45:47.644
CREATE THE.

00:45:47.711 --> 00:45:48.245
POSSIBILITY OF AN ADDITIONAL

00:45:48.312 --> 00:45:50.114
RESERVE.

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:50.981
THERE'S NOTHING THAT THERE IS

00:45:51.048 --> 00:45:52.149
NOTHING IN THIS PROPOSAL THAT

00:45:52.216 --> 00:45:55.119
REQUIRES THAT ADDITIONAL RESERVE.

00:45:55.185 --> 00:45:55.319
TO BE.

00:45:55.385 --> 00:45:57.488
.

00:45:57.554 --> 00:45:59.323
SOME OF THE BUDGET MONIES BE

00:45:59.389 --> 00:46:01.525
ALLOCATED TO IT BUT IT DOES GIVE

00:46:01.592 --> 00:46:03.227
UP THE PROVIDE THE FLEXIBILITY.

00:46:03.293 --> 00:46:04.595
THE OPTION.

00:46:04.661 --> 00:46:06.396
CHOICE

00:46:06.463 --> 00:46:07.865
TO THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR

00:46:07.931 --> 00:46:10.134
SHOULD WE.

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.636
OF THE DECIDE TO PURSUE IT. AYE

00:46:12.703 --> 00:46:14.104
I GET SOME IDEA TO RIGHT NOW WE

00:46:14.171 --> 00:46:16.206
CANCER RIGHT NOW IF WE WANT TO

00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:17.508
PUT MORE MONEY IN RESERVES WE

00:46:17.574 --> 00:46:20.077
CANNOT.

00:46:20.144 --> 00:46:21.411
A I I GUESS.

00:46:21.478 --> 00:46:24.214
MY SIMPER INTERPRETATION OR BE

00:46:24.281 --> 00:46:25.816
OUT. WHEN.

00:46:25.883 --> 00:46:28.352
WE HAVE OUR ACCESS AS SUCH

00:46:28.418 --> 00:46:31.021
SURPLUS A SURPLUS OF NASA NICE

00:46:31.088 --> 00:46:32.589
TO SAY THAT UNLESS UP WITH THAT

00:46:32.656 --> 00:46:35.792
THE MONEY ASIDE DOES NOT FOR

00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:37.094
WHAT RAINY DAY A.

00:46:37.161 --> 00:46:39.196
AND WE CAN USE THAT THE BUT THE

00:46:39.263 --> 00:46:42.432
WHEN. ARE. WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A

00:46:42.499 --> 00:46:44.067
SURPLUS IS OUT AND ATTACKED ME

00:46:44.134 --> 00:46:47.204
AND. OUT WE ARE ASSESSING

00:46:47.271 --> 00:46:50.140
EXCESSIVE TAX TO OUR CITIZENS

00:46:50.207 --> 00:46:52.376
PIE. SO AT THE SUDDEN ARE PUT A

00:46:52.442 --> 00:46:54.745
THRUSH OR JUST OVER THEN WE

00:46:54.811 --> 00:46:56.246
SHOULD STOP THAT AND THE MAYBE

00:46:56.313 --> 00:47:00.484
OF REDUCED US YOU KNOW TAX.

00:47:00.551 --> 00:47:02.152
WHAT WAS CITIZENS US SO FAR SAID

00:47:02.219 --> 00:47:03.654
WE HAVE COLLECTED THAT THE MONEY

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.323
OUT ESCAPE IT? AND A CONTINUE TO

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:07.558
TAX MORE.

00:47:07.624 --> 00:47:09.893
REGARDLESS SO FAR. YET EXIST

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.628
AMOUNT.

00:47:11.695 --> 00:47:13.397
THAT THE REVENUE AND A SOAP SO

00:47:13.463 --> 00:47:14.498
PRODUCES SURPLUSES TO WE

00:47:14.565 --> 00:47:16.533
GENERATE.

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.435
I THINK THERE IS THIS IS

00:47:18.502 --> 00:47:20.470
ALLOWING THAT TO STE POLICY

00:47:20.537 --> 00:47:23.106
DISCUSSION OF WHAT ACTUALLY A OF

00:47:23.173 --> 00:47:24.741
REASONABLE AND RESPONSIBLE

00:47:24.808 --> 00:47:26.243
RESERVE IS.

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:27.744
THE BUDGET WAS CLOSE TO TWO

00:47:27.811 --> 00:47:28.645
HUNDRED.

00:47:28.712 --> 00:47:30.614
BILLION DOLLARS AND THIS IS

00:47:30.681 --> 00:47:32.849
LESS THAN TEN PERCENT OF THAT.

00:47:32.916 --> 00:47:36.153
SO IT ALLOWS THE FLEXIBILITY OF.

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.855
THAT THAT POLICY DISCUSSION TO

00:47:38.922 --> 00:47:40.624
SAVE TEN PERCENT TO TO SOME OF

00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:42.359
THE CITIES THINK THAT FIFTEEN

00:47:42.426 --> 00:47:44.461
PERCENT IS RESPONSIBLE.

00:47:44.528 --> 00:47:45.596
RIGHT NOW WE'RE STUCK AT THE

00:47:45.662 --> 00:47:46.530
LEVEL THAT.

00:47:46.597 --> 00:47:50.867
WAS. PROP TO PASS.

00:47:50.934 --> 00:47:53.503
OKAY AT EL LA OR MAYBE I YOU CAN

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:54.238
EXPLAIN NOT.

00:47:54.304 --> 00:47:56.707
WHEN WE HAVE A TWO HUNDRED

00:47:56.773 --> 00:47:58.308
BILLION DOLLAR YOU KNOW. IT IS

00:47:58.375 --> 00:48:00.277
AT THE TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS UP

00:48:00.344 --> 00:48:01.178
TO ONE TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS

00:48:01.245 --> 00:48:03.480
SEXIST SO WHAT AMOUNT IS OUR

00:48:03.547 --> 00:48:05.983
IDEA. OF WHAT THE KIND OF.

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:08.785
RECESSION ARE WE ANTICIPATING

00:48:08.852 --> 00:48:09.686
IT FOR.

00:48:09.753 --> 00:48:13.156
A RECESSION HIT SO WELL WHAT

00:48:13.223 --> 00:48:14.124
WILL CUT ABOVE BUDGET THAT ARE

00:48:14.191 --> 00:48:15.425
WE ANTICIPATING THAT'S THE SHORT

00:48:15.492 --> 00:48:18.996
THAT WE. NEED THIS EXTRA FUND.

00:48:19.062 --> 00:48:20.764
ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT WE HAVE A

00:48:20.831 --> 00:48:24.134
SO FAR OF CUMULATED.

00:48:24.201 --> 00:48:25.302
I ANALYSTS ALEJO.

00:48:25.369 --> 00:48:27.371
WE DID ANALYSIS RECENTLY WHERE

00:48:27.437 --> 00:48:29.072
WE LOOKED AT YOU KNOW DIFFERENT

00:48:29.139 --> 00:48:30.307
LEVELS OF RESERVES THAT WOULD BE

00:48:30.374 --> 00:48:31.141
REQUIRED.

00:48:31.208 --> 00:48:32.476
IF LEGISLATURE WANTED TO

00:48:32.542 --> 00:48:34.111
WHETHER DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

00:48:34.177 --> 00:48:34.878
RECESSIONS.

00:48:34.945 --> 00:48:38.081
SO YOU KNOW THE SHORT ANSWER TO

00:48:38.148 --> 00:48:39.883
THE QUESTION IS THERE'S NO RIGHT

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:41.018
LEVEL OF PREPARATION THERE'S NO

00:48:41.084 --> 00:48:43.320
SORT OF MAGIC NUMBER IT DEPENDS.

00:48:43.387 --> 00:48:44.321
A LOT ON.

00:48:44.388 --> 00:48:46.757
THE LEGISLATURE'S ASSESSMENT OF

00:48:46.823 --> 00:48:47.958
HOW BIG THE NEXT RECESSION WOULD

00:48:48.025 --> 00:48:50.093
BE. AND HOW MUCH THE LEGISLATURE

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.928
WOULD BE WILLING TO MAKE

00:48:51.995 --> 00:48:53.530
PROGRAMMATIC CUTS ARE REYES PA

00:48:53.597 --> 00:48:54.865
REVENUES DURING A RECESSION

00:48:54.931 --> 00:48:57.067
VERSES I WANTING TO RELY SIMPLY

00:48:57.134 --> 00:48:59.336
ON RESERVES BUT WHAT WE FOUND.

00:48:59.403 --> 00:49:00.537
IS THAT.

00:49:00.604 --> 00:49:02.639
TO WHETHER A MILD RECESSION THE

00:49:02.706 --> 00:49:03.674
LEGISLATURE WOULD MEAN ABOUT

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:05.175
TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS FROM

00:49:05.242 --> 00:49:06.576
MODERATE RECESSION IT WOULD NEED

00:49:06.643 --> 00:49:08.211
ABOUT FORTY BILLION DOLLARS.

00:49:08.278 --> 00:49:10.147
AND FOR A MORE SEVERE RECESSION

00:49:10.213 --> 00:49:11.448
LIKE THE ONE IN TWO THOUSAND

00:49:11.515 --> 00:49:13.517
EIGHT IT WOULD NEED MUCH MORE

00:49:13.583 --> 00:49:14.751
THAN FORTY.

00:49:14.818 --> 00:49:17.120
MISTER OBERNOLTE.

00:49:17.187 --> 00:49:18.488
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE

00:49:18.555 --> 00:49:19.556
TO FOLLOW UP ON DOCTOR CHOICE

00:49:19.623 --> 00:49:20.891
QUESTION BECAUSE.

00:49:20.957 --> 00:49:22.192
WE'VE GOT TO RESERVE ACCOUNTS

00:49:22.259 --> 00:49:23.894
NOW WE GOT THE BUDGET

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:24.494
STABILIZATION ACCOUNT AND YOU

00:49:24.561 --> 00:49:26.063
ARE CORRECT WE CANNOT PUT MORE

00:49:26.129 --> 00:49:26.863
THAN TEN PERCENT OF STATE

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:28.398
REVENUES IN THAT ACCOUNT AND

00:49:28.465 --> 00:49:29.533
THAT WE ARE PROPOSING TO FULLY

00:49:29.599 --> 00:49:30.967
FUND AT THIS YEAR.

00:49:31.034 --> 00:49:32.302
BUT WE ALSO HAVE A SPECIAL FUND

00:49:32.369 --> 00:49:33.670
FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY WHICH

00:49:33.737 --> 00:49:35.005
DOES NOT HAVE A CAP ON IT SO THE

00:49:35.072 --> 00:49:36.740
QUESTION IS WHY I AND I'M VERY

00:49:36.807 --> 00:49:37.974
SUPPORTIVE OF THIS DISCUSSION

00:49:38.041 --> 00:49:39.209
ABOUT THE NEED TO HAVE MORE

00:49:39.276 --> 00:49:40.344
RESERVES AND I THINK WE DO NEED

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:40.977
TO HAVE MORE RESEARCH I THINK

00:49:41.044 --> 00:49:42.813
IT'S. VERY CLEAR BUT I QUESTION

00:49:42.879 --> 00:49:44.381
WHETHER OR NOT YOU NEED TO HAVE

00:49:44.448 --> 00:49:45.682
A THIRD TYPE OF ACCOUNT BECAUSE

00:49:45.749 --> 00:49:47.117
THE US AT THE U. DOES NOT HAVE A.

00:49:47.184 --> 00:49:49.052
A CAP SO WHY NOT JUST PUT THE

00:49:49.119 --> 00:49:51.788
MONEY IN THE US HAVE YOU.

00:49:51.855 --> 00:49:54.624
AND THAT'S NOT HOW HOW I READ.

00:49:54.691 --> 00:49:56.093
THAT'S THE SUBJECT.

00:49:56.159 --> 00:49:58.161
AS LAID OUT BY THE LA YOU KNOW

00:49:58.228 --> 00:49:59.529
MAYBE THE LA O. CAN HELP US WITH

00:49:59.596 --> 00:50:01.865
THAT QUESTION.

00:50:01.932 --> 00:50:03.066
AND YET SO THERE'S.

00:50:03.133 --> 00:50:05.469
AS YOU SAID THERE IS TO.

00:50:05.535 --> 00:50:06.770
TO RESERVE THE BUDGET

00:50:06.837 --> 00:50:07.804
STABILIZATION ACCOUNT OF A

00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:08.739
SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC

00:50:08.805 --> 00:50:09.606
UNCERTAINTIES THE BUDGET

00:50:09.673 --> 00:50:11.074
STABILIZATION ACCOUNT HAS A

00:50:11.141 --> 00:50:12.542
LIMIT OF ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF

00:50:12.609 --> 00:50:14.144
GENERAL FUND REVENUES. THE SFU

00:50:14.211 --> 00:50:15.679
DOES NOT HAVE A LIMIT AT HIGHS.

00:50:15.746 --> 00:50:18.482
TO STATUTORY SALES TAX TRIGGERS.

00:50:18.548 --> 00:50:21.017
THAT WOULD REDUCE THE BALANCE

00:50:21.084 --> 00:50:23.520
OUT OF THE AS IF YOU BY ABOUT%

00:50:23.587 --> 00:50:25.122
ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS

00:50:25.188 --> 00:50:26.623
IF EITHER OF THEM ARE TRIGGERED.

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:27.691
THEY WOULD BE TRIGGERED IN THE

00:50:27.758 --> 00:50:29.493
CASE OF THE ON EITHER THE

00:50:29.559 --> 00:50:31.628
RESERVE REACHING ON ABOUT FOUR

00:50:31.695 --> 00:50:32.963
PERCENT OF GENERAL FUND REVENUES

00:50:33.029 --> 00:50:34.297
OVER THE COURSE OF TWO FISCAL

00:50:34.364 --> 00:50:35.999
YEARS OR THREE PERCENT OF

00:50:36.066 --> 00:50:37.033
GENERAL FUND REVENUES.

00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:39.136
AS WELL AS A DETERMINATION BY

00:50:39.202 --> 00:50:40.904
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT.

00:50:40.971 --> 00:50:41.638
THE BUDGET.

00:50:41.705 --> 00:50:43.106
ESSENTIALLY THAT RESERVES HAD

00:50:43.173 --> 00:50:44.808
GROWN UP BETWEEN MAY AND

00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:46.777
SEPTEMBER SO I WAS FAMILIAR WITH

00:50:46.843 --> 00:50:48.645
THOSE PROVISIONS SO IF I CAN

00:50:48.712 --> 00:50:49.479
RESTATE. I'D.

00:50:49.546 --> 00:50:50.580
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CREATING A

00:50:50.647 --> 00:50:52.883
THIRD TYPE OF RESERVE ACCOUNT SO

00:50:52.949 --> 00:50:54.651
THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO CUT THE

00:50:54.718 --> 00:50:56.086
SALES TAX RATE BY A QUARTER

00:50:56.153 --> 00:50:57.954
PERCENTAGE IS THAT FAIR.

00:50:58.021 --> 00:50:58.922
I WOULD SAY IT GIVES THE

00:50:58.989 --> 00:51:01.425
LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR CHOICES.

00:51:01.491 --> 00:51:02.626
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY

00:51:02.692 --> 00:51:03.994
ANTICIPATE THAT IT SIMPLY GIVES

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:05.595
THE WHAT GIVES US FLEXIBILITY

00:51:05.662 --> 00:51:09.032
AND GIVES US CHOICES.

00:51:09.099 --> 00:51:10.834
OKAY I MEAN I JUST.

00:51:10.901 --> 00:51:11.435
I WOULD DARE TO RESIDENTS A

00:51:11.501 --> 00:51:13.437
FALSE CHOICE THE CURRENT SYSTEM

00:51:13.503 --> 00:51:14.871
THAT. CREATES A SERIES A FALSE

00:51:14.938 --> 00:51:16.540
CHOICES.

00:51:16.606 --> 00:51:17.107
I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE MORE

00:51:17.174 --> 00:51:19.543
CHOICES.

00:51:19.609 --> 00:51:20.343
ALRIGHT REFER ENOUGH YOU YOU

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:22.512
KNOW I I I THINK WE ARE UNIFIED

00:51:22.579 --> 00:51:24.147
IN OUR DESIRE TO SAVE MORE MONEY

00:51:24.214 --> 00:51:25.415
BECAUSE WE ALL AGREE WITH THE LA

00:51:25.482 --> 00:51:26.650
THOUGH THAT A TEN PERCENT

00:51:26.716 --> 00:51:27.150
RESERVE IS NOT ENOUGH.

00:51:27.217 --> 00:51:28.885
HOWEVER.

00:51:28.952 --> 00:51:31.054
WHEN THE SFU WAS CREATED THIS

00:51:31.121 --> 00:51:34.090
STATUTORY SALES TAX CUT WAS I

00:51:34.157 --> 00:51:35.826
PUT HIM BECAUSE. OUT OF

00:51:35.892 --> 00:51:37.527
RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT.

00:51:37.594 --> 00:51:39.196
IF WE HAVE A IN A HEALTHY

00:51:39.262 --> 00:51:41.465
RESERVE THEN MAYBE THE PEOPLE OF

00:51:41.531 --> 00:51:42.032
CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE TAXED A

00:51:42.098 --> 00:51:42.966
LITTLE LESS.

00:51:43.033 --> 00:51:44.000
AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S ON

00:51:44.067 --> 00:51:45.335
A REASONABLE CHOICE AND THE

00:51:45.402 --> 00:51:48.038
ENABLING. LANGUAGE IN THE SMB

00:51:48.104 --> 00:51:49.139
YOU SAYS THAT IF THE RESERVE

00:51:57.614 --> 00:51:58.215

ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY POINTED

01:06:46.569 --> 01:06:47.837
OUT THERE DEFTLY WAS RECENT.

01:06:47.903 --> 01:06:49.872
RESOURCES CONTEMPLATED IN THE

01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:55.845
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE

DECLARATIONS AND FINING IN THE

01:06:57.213 --> 01:06:58.614

OTHER STATES. AND YET THERE WAS

01:07:05.721 --> 01:07:06.989
NO RESOURCES REALLY DEDICATED TO

THOSE SOPHISTICATED CRIMINAL

01:07:08.124 --> 01:07:10.226
ORGANIZATIONS SO WE THOUGHT IT

01:07:10.292 --> 01:07:11.861
WAS REASONABLE TO FIND AT THE

01:07:11.927 --> 01:07:13.562
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE RESOURCES

01:07:13.629 --> 01:07:15.231
FROM THE CANNABIS TAX FUND.

01:07:15.297 --> 01:07:17.533
SATYAJIT COMPONENTS OF THEIR FOR

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.635

01:07:29.545 --> 01:07:30.646
DOJ'S WE SUPPLEMENT THE SMALLER

01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:32.381
COUNTIES BEER COUNTIES HAD THEIR

01:07:32.448 --> 01:07:34.083
OWN ADDICTION TEAM SO HOW'S IT

01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.884
GOING OVER TO THE LOCAL LEVEL

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:36.318
FOR GOING AFTER THE HIGH LEVEL

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:38.921

IN INTERACTIONS WILL TAKE PLACE

01:07:53.335 --> 01:07:54.637
BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE A

01:07:54.703 --> 01:07:57.106
BENEFICIAL RACE RELATIONSHIP

01:07:57.173 --> 01:07:58.641
WHERE THERE PROVIDING LEADS FROM

01:08:17.893 --> 01:08:19.094

JURISDICTIONS THAT MAYBE ART

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:02.972
HAVE RESOURCES IN PLACE. BUT.

01:09:03.038 --> 01:09:04.406

01:11:49.171 --> 01:11:50.873
APPEAR REASONABLE AND BASED ON

01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:52.441
OUR PRELIMINARY REVIEW? AYE WE

01:11:52.508 --> 01:11:53.642
DEFINE THEIR SUBSTANTIAL

01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:54.643
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE LEVEL OF

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:56.145
RESOURCES THAT WILL BE NEEDED ON

01:11:56.211 --> 01:11:57.613
AN ONGOING BASIS IN LARGE PART

01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:58.514
BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH A NEW

01:11:58.580 --> 01:11:59.581
PROGRAM THERE IS A LOT OF

01:11:59.648 --> 01:12:00.883
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT

01:12:00.949 --> 01:12:02.384
WE'RE GONNA NEED. AYE SO WE

01:12:02.451 --> 01:12:04.153
REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT THE

01:12:04.219 --> 01:12:05.487
ADMINISTRATION'S COMING FORWARD

01:12:05.554 --> 01:12:06.689
WITH A PROPOSAL THAT'S FOR

01:12:06.755 --> 01:12:07.723
LIMITED TERM POSITIONS WE THINK

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:08.424
THAT.

01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:10.526
IS VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE IN TWO

01:12:10.592 --> 01:12:11.527
YEARS WHEN THOSE.

01:12:12.094 --> 01:12:13.662
START EXPIRING.

01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:15.297
WE THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE ABLE

01:12:15.364 --> 01:12:17.232

01:12:17.299 --> 01:12:18.901

01:12:20.836 --> 01:12:22.037
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

01:12:22.104 --> 01:12:23.872
SO I THINK THAT'S A. VERY

01:12:23.939 --> 01:12:24.873
VALUABLE THING I THINK THEY'RE

01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:25.974
JUST A COUPLE THINGS I WANTED TO

01:12:26.041 --> 01:12:27.409

01:12:27.476 --> 01:12:30.312
ONE IS A THE APPROPRIATE USES

01:12:30.379 --> 01:12:31.947
OF PROP SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS I

01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:32.281
KNOW THERE'S.

01:12:32.347 --> 01:12:35.317
REFERENCE IN THAT AGENDA AYE TO

01:12:35.384 --> 01:12:36.919
THAT ISSUE YOU WITH REGARD TO

01:12:36.985 --> 01:12:37.586
DOJ.

01:12:37.653 --> 01:12:39.455
THE ISSUE WE'VE JUST BEEN

01:12:39.521 --> 01:12:40.889
DISCUSSING COMPROMISED FIGHT

01:12:40.956 --> 01:12:42.458
ANOTHER SMALLER ISSUE.

01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:44.259
WHICH IS RELATED TO THE AT TO A

01:12:44.326 --> 01:12:45.627
PIECE OF THREE EMPLOYMENT

01:12:45.694 --> 01:12:47.563
DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT PROPOSAL

01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:48.597
WHICH WOULD FIND WORKFORCE

01:12:48.664 --> 01:12:49.998
RELATED ACTIVITIES CITIES ARE

01:12:50.065 --> 01:12:51.600
THINGS LIKE. I'M HOPING

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:53.035
BUSINESSES TO.

01:12:53.102 --> 01:12:55.504
HIGHER FROM CANNABIS INDUSTRY.

01:12:55.571 --> 01:12:57.372
AND ALSO HELPING JOB SEEKERS TO

01:12:57.439 --> 01:12:59.208
TO FIND JOBS WITHIN THE CANNABIS

01:12:59.274 --> 01:13:01.477
INDUSTRY. ARMS IT WASN'T CLEAR

01:13:01.543 --> 01:13:02.511
OUT TO US IF THAT'S ELIGIBLE

01:13:02.578 --> 01:13:03.946
UNDER THE PROP SIXTY FOUR WHICH

01:13:04.012 --> 01:13:05.013
LIMITS THOSE.

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:06.648
EDT FUNDS TO APPLYING IN

01:13:06.715 --> 01:13:08.884
ENFORCING STATE LABOR LAWS SO WE

01:13:08.951 --> 01:13:10.152
JUST WANTED TO FIGHT THAT IS AN

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:11.954
ISSUE THAT COULD BE. FOLLOWED UP

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.889
ON I'M AND THEN THE SECOND ISSUE

01:13:13.956 --> 01:13:14.957
WHEN IT'S A FIGHT FOR THE

01:13:15.023 --> 01:13:16.125
COMMITTEE IS RELATED TO THAT

01:13:16.191 --> 01:13:19.228
DEPARTMENT ATTACKS IN FEET

01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:20.429
MINISTRATION.

01:13:20.496 --> 01:13:21.096
SO WE DO THINK IT'S REASONABLE

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:21.697
FOR THEM TO GET ADDITIONAL

01:13:21.764 --> 01:13:22.898
RESOURCES FOR A VARIETY OF

01:13:22.965 --> 01:13:23.732
ACTIVITIES THAT.

01:13:23.799 --> 01:13:26.201
THAT THEY WILL BE UNDERTAKING

01:13:26.268 --> 01:13:28.237
I'M THERE'S ONE PIECE THAT WE.

01:13:28.303 --> 01:13:30.606
WE WANTED TO KIND OF FLAG AND

01:13:30.672 --> 01:13:31.940
THAT PEACE IS RELATED TO THE

01:13:32.007 --> 01:13:34.943
NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS I'M SO THE

01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:36.345
TRAILER BILL FROM LAST YEAR

01:13:36.411 --> 01:13:37.613
DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER

01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:39.414
OF TAX PAYERS THAT DON'T HAVE TO

01:13:39.481 --> 01:13:40.149
HANDLE.

01:13:40.215 --> 01:13:41.917
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT IT.

01:13:41.984 --> 01:13:43.786
HAS DISTRIBUTORS DOING TAX

01:13:43.852 --> 01:13:45.621
COLLECTIONS OF TICKET FROM BELOW

01:13:45.687 --> 01:13:48.023
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OF ENTITIES

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:50.092
PAYING THESE TAXES TO PROVIDE

01:13:50.159 --> 01:13:51.226
ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED.

01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:53.262
SO THERE WAS A SOME AYE SOME

01:13:53.328 --> 01:13:54.897
WHATEVER REDUCTION THAT'S

01:13:54.963 --> 01:13:55.798
REFLECTED IN THEIR MEN THEIR

01:13:55.864 --> 01:13:57.166
BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL A HUNDRED

01:13:57.232 --> 01:13:58.767
THOUSAND AND WE THINK THAT

01:13:58.834 --> 01:14:00.636
PROBABLY A ABOUT AN ADDITIONAL

01:14:00.702 --> 01:14:02.571
FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND REDUCTION

01:14:02.638 --> 01:14:03.438
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE THERE.

01:14:03.505 --> 01:14:04.239
THERE IT'S A GIVEN THAT

01:14:04.306 --> 01:14:06.341
AUGMENTATION IT WOULD JUST BE OF

01:14:06.408 --> 01:14:07.609
A TWO POINT ONE MILLION RATHER

01:14:07.676 --> 01:14:09.211
THAN TWO POINT FIVE MILLION. SO

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:10.179
THAT WAS THE SECOND ISSUE IS

01:14:10.245 --> 01:14:11.446
WANTED TO FIGHT FOR FOLKS.

01:14:11.513 --> 01:14:13.248
HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS IF IF

01:14:13.315 --> 01:14:15.083

MILLION TO JUST AREAS THAT OUR

01:15:28.857 --> 01:15:30.626
LICENSING IS A GREAT IDEA.

01:15:30.692 --> 01:15:32.794
AND WHILE WE ALL KNOW THAT THE

01:15:32.861 --> 01:15:34.296
ILLEGAL MARKET IS IS A MASSIVE

01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:35.797

ABOUT FOR AWHILE.

01:27:34.616 --> 01:27:36.084

BECAUSE I TRY TO READ THIS AND

01:27:49.664 --> 01:27:50.198
THERE'S A LOT OF BUREAUCRATIC

01:27:50.264 --> 01:27:51.666
LANGUAGE IN IT.

01:27:51.733 --> 01:27:53.101

WITHOUT YOUR APPROVAL WE'VE WE?

YEAR TO REQUEST RESOURCES I'M

01:28:05.346 --> 01:28:06.280
ALREADY FORMING NEXT YEAR'S

01:28:06.347 --> 01:28:07.749

01:28:16.090 --> 01:28:18.493
FROM OUR OUR PROJECT CIVIL WITH

01:28:18.559 --> 01:28:19.694
ELIO SAY THAT.

01:28:19.761 --> 01:28:21.562
SO WE ALSO INCLUDED A

01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:22.764
RECOMMENDATION THAT THEY.

01:28:22.830 --> 01:28:24.666

RESULTS FROM STAGE TO ANALYSIS.

01:28:28.936 --> 01:28:31.472

YOUR DEPARTMENT KNOWS MY GENERAL

01:28:56.731 --> 01:28:57.899
PERSPECTIVE ON A LOT OF THESE

01:28:57.965 --> 01:29:00.668
PROJECTS NOT SPECIFIC TO YOUR

01:29:00.735 --> 01:29:02.770

01:29:02.837 --> 01:29:04.072

FROM THE CHAIR WHAT YOUR

01:29:07.475 --> 01:29:08.576
THOUGHTS ARE ON THIS LIKE I

01:29:08.643 --> 01:29:09.610

SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO TO

01:59:55.154 --> 01:59:57.390
OUTREACH THROUGH CBO'S. AND MY

01:59:57.456 --> 01:59:59.392
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT'S PART OF

01:59:59.458 --> 02:00:00.927
THE PLAN BUT THERE'S NOT A

02:00:00.993 --> 02:00:02.395
WILLINGNESS AT THIS TIME TO

02:00:02.461 --> 02:00:05.531
COMMIT TO THAT. OF I WOULD LIKE

02:00:05.598 --> 02:00:07.700
TO SUGGEST THAT WE COULD MAKE

02:00:07.767 --> 02:00:09.068
THOSE COMMITMENTS IF THAT IS

02:00:09.135 --> 02:00:10.069
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IF THE

02:00:10.136 --> 02:00:12.405
ISSUE IS. IS IS WHETHER.

02:00:12.471 --> 02:00:14.240
DEAL WITH HAS A STAFFING TO

02:00:14.307 --> 02:00:16.175
FIGURE THIS OUT YOU KNOW

02:00:16.242 --> 02:00:17.209
OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO GIVE

02:00:17.276 --> 02:00:18.644
THEIR APARTMENT TIME TO DO THAT

02:00:18.711 --> 02:00:20.980
BUT NOT HAVING A HARD COMMITMENT

02:00:21.047 --> 02:00:22.448
ON WHAT THAT CBO OUT REACH IS

02:00:22.515 --> 02:00:24.450
GONNA LOOK LIKE. A I THINK IS IS

02:00:24.517 --> 02:00:26.419
IS CONCERNING MANY OF US AND AND

02:00:26.485 --> 02:00:27.320
I'VE CERTAINLY HEARD ALREADY

02:00:27.386 --> 02:00:28.654
JUST IN THE LAST TWELVE HOURS

02:00:28.721 --> 02:00:30.156
CONCERNS AROUND STATE ON THIS

02:00:30.222 --> 02:00:32.625
TOPIC SO. I WONDER IF YOU HAVE A

02:00:32.692 --> 02:00:34.827
PERSPECTIVE ON ON THAT QUESTION.

02:00:34.894 --> 02:00:36.095
CERTAINLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

02:00:36.162 --> 02:00:37.697
PROPOSAL DOES INCLUDE TWELVE

02:00:37.763 --> 02:00:39.498
POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS BILL

CENSUS PLANNED ON A HOUSE BEEN

02:00:48.374 --> 02:00:50.643
IN SOME PRIOR YEARS RECOGNIZING.

02:00:50.710 --> 02:00:52.678
THE EFFECTIVENESS AND IMPORTANCE

02:00:52.745 --> 02:00:55.214
OF HAVING LOCAL LEVEL OUTREACH

02:00:55.281 --> 02:00:57.183
INVOLVED IN THIS EFFORT.

02:00:57.249 --> 02:00:58.250

MILLION DOLLARS

02:01:05.024 --> 02:01:07.259

02:01:07.326 --> 02:01:08.194
WE MADE SURE THAT ARE UNDER

02:01:08.260 --> 02:01:11.130
COUNT A WAS NOT. DIDN'T INCREASE

02:01:11.197 --> 02:01:12.565
AND I JUST OF THE QUICK MATH

02:01:12.632 --> 02:01:13.699
LITERALLY AS YOU'RE SAYING THAT

02:01:13.766 --> 02:01:14.667
A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A

02:01:14.734 --> 02:01:16.402
DISTRICT IS EQUIVALENT OF.

02:01:16.469 --> 02:01:18.904
YOU KNOW ONE OR TWO F. T. EASE I

02:01:18.971 --> 02:01:19.772
DON'T THINK THAT'S A THAT I JUST

02:01:19.839 --> 02:01:21.240
DON'T THINK THAT'S ADEQUATE.

02:01:21.307 --> 02:01:23.409
NOT GIVEN WHAT'S AT STAKE IF IF

02:01:23.476 --> 02:01:25.211

02:01:25.277 --> 02:01:27.146
SO I JUST WANNA PUT THAT OUT

02:01:27.213 --> 02:01:28.981
THERE IS A PERSPECTIVE ARE.

02:01:29.048 --> 02:01:30.049
MY HOPE IS WE MIGHT BE ABLE HOLE

02:01:30.116 --> 02:01:31.150
THIS OPEN FOR A FEW DAYS FOR

02:01:31.217 --> 02:01:32.518
FURTHER DISCUSSION BUT IN

02:01:32.585 --> 02:01:33.152
OBVIOUSLY.

02:01:33.219 --> 02:01:34.754
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT

02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:39.091
CONVERSATION.

02:01:39.158 --> 02:01:40.593

FOUNDATIONS CAME IN WITH TEN

02:01:51.203 --> 02:01:52.371
MILLION SO TWELVE POINT

02:01:52.438 --> 02:01:53.973
SOMETHING WAS THE TOTAL EFFORT

02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:55.408
IN TWO THOUSAND TEN?

02:02:03.983 --> 02:02:05.251
ACROSS THE BORDER MOTHER HOW

02:02:05.317 --> 02:02:06.752
MUCH THAT WAS FROM THE FEDS I

02:02:06.819 --> 02:02:08.220

02:02:21.667 --> 02:02:21.967
SO.

02:02:22.034 --> 02:02:23.669

THE FIFTY MILLION IS GONNA TV

02:02:49.295 --> 02:02:50.796
