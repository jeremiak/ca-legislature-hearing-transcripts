A STUDENT OF HISTORY. THE

00:36:53.844 --> 00:36:55.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

CALLED CONFRONTATIONAL POLITICS.

00:37:51.202 --> 00:37:53.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NOW THAT TITLE MIGHT INTIMIDATE

00:37:53.137 --> 00:37:55.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU A LITTLE BIT. BUT I RATE

00:37:55.506 --> 00:37:56.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
