00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:51.243 region:rollup2
EDUCATION CODE DISMISSALS THAT

00:26:50.275 --> 00:26:52.511 region:rollup2
ONLY INVOLVE AGREE JUST

00:26:51.243 --> 00:26:53.846 region:rollup2
MISCONDUCT.

00:26:52.511 --> 00:26:55.714 region:rollup2
UGH I THINK THAT WOULD UNDO SOME

00:26:53.846 --> 00:26:57.249 region:rollup2
OF THE.

00:26:55.714 --> 00:26:58.550 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL BUT THE

00:26:57.249 --> 00:26:59.885 region:rollup2
CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS IF IT

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:02.488 region:rollup2
APPLIES TO ALL DISMISSAL

00:26:59.885 --> 00:27:04.289 region:rollup2
HEARINGS IN WHICH ANY ALLEGATION

00:27:02.488 --> 00:27:04.990 region:rollup2
OF EGREGIOUS MISCONDUCT IS MADE.

00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:06.725 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO MAKE THOSE

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:07.993 region:rollup2
HEARINGS A MORE TIME CONSUMING

00:27:06.725 --> 00:27:10.696 region:rollup2
AND MORE EXPENSIVE AND MY

00:27:07.993 --> 00:27:11.563 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF AB TWO FIFTEEN.

00:27:10.696 --> 00:27:13.198 region:rollup2
THERE WAS PASSED IN TWENTY

00:27:11.563 --> 00:27:14.933 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN WAS THAT PART OF THE

00:27:13.198 --> 00:27:16.435 region:rollup2
OVERWHELMING GOAL THERE WAS TO

00:27:14.933 --> 00:27:18.637 region:rollup2
MAKE TEACHER DISMISSAL HEARINGS

00:27:16.435 --> 00:27:20.072 region:rollup2
LESS EXPENSIVE. AND QUICKER FOR

00:27:18.637 --> 00:27:21.440 region:rollup2
THE BENEFIT OF TEACHERS AND THE

00:27:20.072 --> 00:27:22.841 region:rollup2
BENEFIT OF THE PUBLIC.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.911 region:rollup2
AND ANYTIME THAT YOU START

00:27:22.841 --> 00:27:27.613 region:rollup2
ADDING ADDITIONAL HEARINGS INTO

00:27:25.911 --> 00:27:29.114 region:rollup2
THE TEACHER DISMISSAL PROCESS

00:27:27.613 --> 00:27:30.983 region:rollup2
YOU RATCHET UP THE COST AND YOU

00:27:29.114 --> 00:27:32.417 region:rollup2
RATCHET UP THE TIME. AND SO THE

00:27:30.983 --> 00:27:34.186 region:rollup2
WAY THIS BILL IS CURRENTLY

00:27:32.417 --> 00:27:36.188 region:rollup2
WRITTEN UNDER FOUR FOUR NINE

00:27:34.186 --> 00:27:37.556 region:rollup2
NINE ZERO FIRST YOU HAVE A

00:27:36.188 --> 00:27:38.724 region:rollup2
HEARING TO DETERMINE IF THE

00:27:37.556 --> 00:27:40.225 region:rollup2
CHILD WITNESS NEEDS CHILD

00:27:38.724 --> 00:27:41.727 region:rollup2
ADVOCATES.

00:27:40.225 --> 00:27:42.794 region:rollup2
BUT THEN IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE

00:27:41.727 --> 00:27:43.896 region:rollup2
ANOTHER HEARING IN FRONT OF THE

00:27:42.794 --> 00:27:45.464 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE TO

00:27:43.896 --> 00:27:47.866 region:rollup2

CHILD WITNESS SHOULD TESTIFY BY

CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION ONLY

00:27:49.334 --> 00:27:51.937 region:rollup2
YOU COULD HAVE THE POTENTIAL

00:27:50.235 --> 00:27:53.572 region:rollup2
HEARING TO DETERMINE WHO THE

00:27:51.937 --> 00:27:54.840 region:rollup2
CHILD ADVOCATES ARE GOING TO BE.

00:27:53.572 --> 00:27:56.508 region:rollup2
AND YOU COULD HAVE A POTENTIAL

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.477 region:rollup2
HEARING TO DETERMINE IF THE

00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:59.978 region:rollup2
CHILD SHOULD TESTIFY. THROUGH

00:27:58.477 --> 00:28:00.846 region:rollup2
DEPOSITION ONLY AND SO ALL OF

00:27:59.978 --> 00:28:02.548 region:rollup2
THESE HEARINGS ARE GOING TO

00:28:00.846 --> 00:28:03.916 region:rollup2
REQUIRE BRIEFING AN ADDITIONAL

00:28:02.548 --> 00:28:05.918 region:rollup2
TIME AN ADDITIONAL WORK BY THE

00:28:03.916 --> 00:28:08.787 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE.

00:28:05.918 --> 00:28:10.522 region:rollup2
THE DEFINITION OF MINER AND

00:28:08.787 --> 00:28:11.456 region:rollup2
FOUR FOUR NINE NINE ZERO MY

00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:12.424 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING IS THE WAY IT'S

00:28:11.456 --> 00:28:13.025 region:rollup2
WRITTEN WOULD INCLUDE EVERY

00:28:12.424 --> 00:28:15.127 region:rollup2
PERSON UNDER AGE EIGHTEEN AND

00:28:13.025 --> 00:28:16.595 region:rollup2
SO.

00:28:15.127 --> 00:28:18.664 region:rollup2
THAT APPEARS TO ENCOMPASS NOT

00:28:16.595 --> 00:28:20.032 region:rollup2
ONLY THE ALLEGED CHILD VICTIM IN

00:28:18.664 --> 00:28:21.967 region:rollup2
A DISMISSAL HEARING BUT EVERY

00:28:20.032 --> 00:28:23.502 region:rollup2
STUDENT WHO MAY BE CALLED AT ANY

00:28:21.967 --> 00:28:24.670 region:rollup2
POINT AS A WITNESS SO IN THE

00:28:23.502 --> 00:28:26.638 region:rollup2
CASE THAT I MENTIONED THE GLOVE

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:28.006 region:rollup2
YANO CASE. YOU HAD THE TWO

00:28:26.638 --> 00:28:29.641 region:rollup2
STUDENTS INVOLVED IN THE FIGHT

00:28:28.006 --> 00:28:31.843 region:rollup2
BUT THEN YOU HAD EVERY CHILD NOT

00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:33.111 region:rollup2
P. CLASSROOM WHO OBSERVED. THE

00:28:31.843 --> 00:28:34.379 region:rollup2
FIGHT OF WHAT HAPPENED AND YOU

00:28:33.111 --> 00:28:35.981 region:rollup2
WERE ASKED TO TESTIFY ABOUT WHAT

00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:37.549 region:rollup2
THEY SAW AND SO IT'S NOT CLEAR

00:28:35.981 --> 00:28:38.717 region:rollup2
FROM THE BILL AS WRITTEN. WOULD

00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:40.452 region:rollup2
EVERYONE OF THOSE STUDENT

00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:42.254 region:rollup2
WITNESSES HAVE A CHILD OUT THE

00:28:40.452 --> 00:28:44.156 region:rollup2

00:28:42.254 --> 00:28:46.191 region:rollup2
HEARING IS BALLOONING IN TERMS

00:28:44.156 --> 00:28:49.561 region:rollup2
OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE INVOLVED

00:28:46.191 --> 00:28:50.629 region:rollup2
IN THE TIME. AND I DO NEED TO TO

00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:51.697 region:rollup2
WRAP UP THE YES.

00:28:50.629 --> 00:28:52.731 region:rollup2
SO OF WEALTH SEAT WHILE CITY IS

00:28:51.697 --> 00:28:54.466 region:rollup2
OPPOSING THE BILL I THINK.

00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:56.335 region:rollup2

THAT AND I ALSO THINK OF

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:06.778 region:rollup2
REMOVING THE.

00:29:03.942 --> 00:29:08.981 region:rollup2
DEPOSITION ONLY TESTIMONY A IDEA

00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:10.082 region:rollup2
SO THAT THE RESPONDENT TRULY

00:29:08.981 --> 00:29:11.450 region:rollup2
WOULD BE AFFORDED THE RIGHT TO

00:29:10.082 --> 00:29:12.784 region:rollup2
CROSS EXAMINE THE WITNESSES

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:14.753 region:rollup2
AGAINST HIM. THAT WOULD HELP

00:29:12.784 --> 00:29:16.855 region:rollup2
THANK YOU THANK YOU.

00:29:14.753 --> 00:29:18.957 region:rollup2

00:29:16.855 --> 00:29:21.593 region:rollup2
ANIMALS LIKE TO WAIT IN SUPPORT.

00:29:18.957 --> 00:29:22.160 region:rollup2

TO THE OPPOSITION.

00:29:26.898 --> 00:29:29.835 region:rollup2

SO IT IT.

00:29:36.141 --> 00:29:39.177 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE SPELL

00:29:37.142 --> 00:29:40.245 region:rollup2
IN AND TRIED TO ADDRESS SOME OF

00:29:39.177 --> 00:29:41.580 region:rollup2
THE CONCERNS I KNOW INSURGENTS

00:29:40.245 --> 00:29:43.348 region:rollup2
OR THAT YOU ARE INTERESTED IN

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:44.383 region:rollup2
THAT AS WELL.

00:29:43.348 --> 00:29:45.817 region:rollup2
AND SIR OUR QUESTIONS PERHAPS

00:29:44.383 --> 00:29:47.819 region:rollup2
YOU COULD ADDRESS SOME OF THE

00:29:45.817 --> 00:29:49.688 region:rollup2
CONCERNS AND THEN.

00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:51.757 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU INTEND TO? I GO WITH

00:29:49.688 --> 00:29:53.225 region:rollup2
THE SPELLS OF ASSORTED DOES

00:29:51.757 --> 00:29:54.526 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDED TO PASS.

00:29:53.225 --> 00:29:56.028 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION HERE BECAUSE OF

00:29:54.526 --> 00:29:57.396 region:rollup2
THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE BUT

00:29:56.028 --> 00:29:58.664 region:rollup2
THIS IS ALWAYS A DELICATE ISSUE

00:29:57.396 --> 00:29:59.264 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW YOUR GOAL HERE IS TO

00:29:58.664 --> 00:30:00.932 region:rollup2
TRY AND PROTECT CHILDREN WHICH

00:29:59.264 --> 00:30:02.534 region:rollup2
IS.

00:30:00.932 --> 00:30:04.469 region:rollup2
I BRADLEY LAUDABLE AND AN OUR

00:30:02.534 --> 00:30:06.538 region:rollup2
OUR MAIN GOAL IS NOT BE PREGNANT

00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:08.774 region:rollup2
WITH YOU AND A REASON FOR ALL OF

00:30:06.538 --> 00:30:10.042 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENT STEPS IS NOT ONLY

00:30:08.774 --> 00:30:11.576 region:rollup2
TO PROTECT STUDENTS.

00:30:10.042 --> 00:30:12.744 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO TO PROTECT THE TEACHERS

00:30:11.576 --> 00:30:14.346 region:rollup2
TO INSURE THAT THERE ISN'T NO

00:30:12.744 --> 00:30:15.447 region:rollup2
FALSE ACCUSATIONS.

00:30:14.346 --> 00:30:16.882 region:rollup2
BOB THIS IS ABOUT THE MOST

00:30:15.447 --> 00:30:18.050 region:rollup2
EGREGIOUS

00:30:16.882 --> 00:30:19.151 region:rollup2
TEACHERS THAT ARE OUT THERE

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:21.019 region:rollup2
WHICH I THINK OF IT'S A VERY

00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:22.988 region:rollup2
SMALL NUMBER SO WE'RE NOT TRYING

00:30:21.019 --> 00:30:24.723 region:rollup2
TO GO AFTER THE MAJORITY OF LA

00:30:22.988 --> 00:30:26.491 region:rollup2
UNIFIED. ESPECIALLY SINCE MY

00:30:24.723 --> 00:30:27.292 region:rollup2
DAUGHTER'S TEACHER MY FUNDED

00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:29.728 region:rollup2
FUTURE MY EX WIFE TO TAKE YOUR

00:30:27.292 --> 00:30:29.961 region:rollup2
WORD ON ABOUT THE THIRD ONE BUT

00:30:29.728 --> 00:30:32.264 region:rollup2
ANYWAY.

00:30:29.961 --> 00:30:33.665 region:rollup2
.

00:30:32.264 --> 00:30:35.333 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE

00:30:33.665 --> 00:30:36.468 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THEY DAY WENT INTO

00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:37.636 region:rollup2
THAT PROFESSION TO DO THE RIGHT

00:30:36.468 --> 00:30:39.438 region:rollup2
THING. BUT THERE THOSE

00:30:37.636 --> 00:30:41.707 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY THAT HAVE BEEN

00:30:39.438 --> 00:30:42.741 region:rollup2
PROBLEMATIC AND WE NEED TO MAKE

00:30:41.707 --> 00:30:44.476 region:rollup2
SURE THAT IS TO.

00:30:42.741 --> 00:30:46.111 region:rollup2
A CHILD THAT FIRST.

00:30:44.476 --> 00:30:47.112 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE AFFORD AN

00:30:46.111 --> 00:30:48.880 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE

00:30:47.112 --> 00:30:49.448 region:rollup2
JUDGE TO BE ABLE TO DISCERN

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.482 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT IT SHOULD BE

00:30:49.448 --> 00:30:52.851 region:rollup2
DONE.

00:30:50.482 --> 00:30:54.319 region:rollup2
OF AN OPEN CLAYCOURT NETTING

00:30:52.851 --> 00:30:56.154 region:rollup2
INCLUDES SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS AND

00:30:54.319 --> 00:30:57.789 region:rollup2
SEVEN YEAR OLDS CAN BE ABUSED IN

00:30:56.154 --> 00:30:58.957 region:rollup2
WAYS THAT ARE. LIKE A VERY

00:30:57.789 --> 00:31:00.459 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO BE IN THE

00:30:58.957 --> 00:31:02.127 region:rollup2
SAME ROOM WITH THE ACCUSER AND

00:31:00.459 --> 00:31:03.795 region:rollup2
SO THE STEP THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE

00:31:02.127 --> 00:31:05.263 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT A VERY IMPORTANT.

00:31:03.795 --> 00:31:07.099 region:rollup2
I'M I WILL.

00:31:05.263 --> 00:31:08.367 region:rollup2
WORK WITH EVERYONE THAT IN

00:31:07.099 --> 00:31:09.634 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION MAKE SURE WE DON'T IT

00:31:08.367 --> 00:31:11.670 region:rollup2
COULD BECOME TO BROUGHT IT WE

00:31:09.634 --> 00:31:12.871 region:rollup2
NARROW IT DOWN COOKS WE TRULY

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:14.172 region:rollup2
TRULY TRULY.

00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:15.273 region:rollup2
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

00:31:14.172 --> 00:31:17.142 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALS

00:31:15.273 --> 00:31:18.844 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN A VERY MODIFICATION

00:31:17.142 --> 00:31:19.878 region:rollup2
IS APPLE IN MY DISTRICT.

00:31:18.844 --> 00:31:21.513 region:rollup2
I WOULD NOT WANT THE ELEMENTARY

00:31:19.878 --> 00:31:22.380 region:rollup2
SCHOOL.

00:31:21.513 --> 00:31:24.082 region:rollup2
STUDENT TO BE IN THERE WAS

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:26.118 region:rollup2
SOMEONE THAT HAS DONE SOME THE

00:31:24.082 --> 00:31:27.152 region:rollup2
MOST EGREGIOUS ACTS OF GOD CAN

00:31:26.118 --> 00:31:29.788 region:rollup2
EVEN MENTION IN THIS ROOM RIGHT

00:31:27.152 --> 00:31:31.723 region:rollup2
NOW. AND SO THE POINT OF IT IS

00:31:29.788 --> 00:31:33.458 region:rollup2
THAT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS

00:31:31.723 --> 00:31:34.025 region:rollup2

FEDERAL LEGISLATION. THAT

TIGHTENED CALIFORNIA LAW.

REGARDING THAT IN THIS BILL WE

00:49:35.039 --> 00:49:39.076 region:rollup2
BELIEVE AS.

00:49:36.874 --> 00:49:41.979 region:rollup2

SAME LEVEL OF SAFETY.

00:49:51.555 --> 00:49:54.024 region:rollup2

00:50:00.297 --> 00:50:03.167 region:rollup2
NOTE THAT THE.

00:50:01.632 --> 00:50:05.636 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS WHICH WE REALLY

00:50:03.167 --> 00:50:06.770 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE IS VERY THOROUGH AND

00:50:05.636 --> 00:50:09.173 region:rollup2
IT SPECIFIES THAT A

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:10.975 region:rollup2

FEDERAL LAW. THAT APPLIES ONLY

00:50:14.078 --> 00:50:17.581 region:rollup2
TO SAFETY RECALLS.

00:50:15.646 --> 00:50:19.316 region:rollup2
AND THAT IT SPECIFICALLY SAYS

00:50:17.581 --> 00:50:21.452 region:rollup2
THAT IT DOES NOT INCLUDE A

00:50:19.316 --> 00:50:23.087 region:rollup2
SERVICE CAMPAIGN WHICH IS WHY IT

00:50:21.452 --> 00:50:24.121 region:rollup2
IS DONE FOR LESSER KINDS OF

00:50:23.087 --> 00:50:26.323 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS THAT AREN'T SAFETY

00:50:24.121 --> 00:50:28.158 region:rollup2

COMPLY THE FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE

SAFETY STANDARD OR WHERE. IT

00:50:42.606 --> 00:50:46.777 region:rollup2
POSES AN UNREASONABLE RISK TO

00:50:44.408 --> 00:50:47.711 region:rollup2

00:50:46.777 --> 00:50:48.979 region:rollup2

AND. FIGURE OUT A WAY TO ENSURE

00:54:59.796 --> 00:55:02.032 region:rollup2
THAT AIRPORT COMPLIANCE IS

00:55:00.864 --> 00:55:03.834 region:rollup2

WORKING IN THE RENTAL CAR

00:55:13.544 --> 00:55:16.780 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. WERE

00:55:15.179 --> 00:55:19.950 region:rollup2
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT

00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:21.552 region:rollup2
OF THIS BILL ON ON THEIR JOBS IN

00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:23.287 region:rollup2
THE VIABILITY OF THEIR WORK.

00:55:21.552 --> 00:55:26.857 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT.

00:55:23.287 --> 00:55:29.860 region:rollup2
THE ENTITY THAT THIS BILL WOULD.

00:55:26.857 --> 00:55:31.461 region:rollup2
BASICALLY AUTHORIZED IN LAW IS A

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:33.497 region:rollup2
RENTAL CAR COMPANY AND WHAT

00:55:31.461 --> 00:55:35.899 region:rollup2
COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH THEM WITH

00:55:33.497 --> 00:55:37.267 region:rollup2
NOT ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS THAT

00:55:35.899 --> 00:55:39.303 region:rollup2
RENTAL CAR COMPANIES ARE. ARE

00:55:37.267 --> 00:55:40.838 region:rollup2

ETCETERA AND.

00:55:40.838 --> 00:55:45.342 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT COULD CREATE AN

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:46.944 region:rollup2
UNLEVEL PLAYING FIELD AGAIN

00:55:45.342 --> 00:55:48.378 region:rollup2
PUTTING THOSE JOBS IN JEOPARDY

00:55:46.944 --> 00:55:49.146 region:rollup2
WE WILL LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS

00:55:48.378 --> 00:55:50.614 region:rollup2
WE HAVEN'T.

00:55:49.146 --> 00:55:53.183 region:rollup2
REVIEW DAM.

00:55:50.614 --> 00:55:54.785 region:rollup2
AT THAT BUT AT THIS MOMENT WERE

00:55:53.183 --> 00:55:55.886 region:rollup2
STILL POST

00:55:58.555 --> 00:56:00.591 region:rollup2
WE WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL AND

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:03.060 region:rollup2
PRINT.

00:56:00.591 --> 00:56:04.861 region:rollup2
ON THE THE BILL BEFORE THE

00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:07.097 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE TODAY I THINK. WE'RE

00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:08.865 region:rollup2
EVALUATING IT WE HAVE IT

00:56:07.097 --> 00:56:11.001 region:rollup2
PROBABLY RAISES MORE QUESTIONS

00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:11.235 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT AN

00:56:11.001 --> 00:56:12.669 region:rollup2
ANSWER.

00:56:11.235 --> 00:56:14.137 region:rollup2
.

00:56:12.669 --> 00:56:15.739 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE THE GORDON BILL

00:56:14.137 --> 00:56:17.708 region:rollup2
WHEN IT PASSED WAS INTENDED TO

00:56:15.739 --> 00:56:19.576 region:rollup2
OF APPLIED TO A FLEET OF ONE.

00:56:17.708 --> 00:56:21.645 region:rollup2
AND WAS INTENDED TO APPLY TO

00:56:19.576 --> 00:56:23.180 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS LIKE THIS SO BY

00:56:21.645 --> 00:56:24.481 region:rollup2
MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION AND

00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:26.483 region:rollup2
DEFINING PERSONAL VEHICLE

00:56:24.481 --> 00:56:29.353 region:rollup2
SHARING. AS SOMETHING DIFFERENT

00:56:26.483 --> 00:56:31.321 region:rollup2
THAN RENTAL CAR ARE WE A ARE WE

00:56:29.353 --> 00:56:33.056 region:rollup2
CREATING UP AN ADDITIONAL

00:56:31.321 --> 00:56:35.025 region:rollup2
LOOPHOLE ARE WE CREATING A

00:56:33.056 --> 00:56:36.994 region:rollup2
CONFLICT IN THE LAW WHERE NINE

00:56:35.025 --> 00:56:40.330 region:rollup2
SHOULD REALLY. REALISTICALLY

00:56:36.994 --> 00:56:41.865 region:rollup2
EXIST RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THAT LAW

00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:44.301 region:rollup2
SHOULD APPLY.

00:56:41.865 --> 00:56:46.503 region:rollup2
TO THESE RENTAL TRANSACTIONS.

00:56:44.301 --> 00:56:47.771 region:rollup2
THE E. ALSO SO THAT'S A

00:56:46.503 --> 00:56:49.840 region:rollup2
QUESTION THAT WE'RE THINKING

00:56:47.771 --> 00:56:51.975 region:rollup2
ABOUT LOOKING THROUGH TRYING TO

00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:54.811 region:rollup2
ANSWER. IN ADDITION HOW DOES

00:56:51.975 --> 00:56:56.480 region:rollup2
THIS LAW INTERACT WITH FEDERAL

00:56:54.811 --> 00:56:59.216 region:rollup2
LAW WHICH APPLIES TO FLEETS.

00:56:56.480 --> 00:57:01.551 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT THAT DESPITE THE

00:56:59.216 --> 00:57:03.587 region:rollup2
PERSONAL VEHICLE SHARING A

00:57:01.551 --> 00:57:05.489 region:rollup2
DEFINITION IN THE BILL OR IS

00:57:03.587 --> 00:57:07.190 region:rollup2
PROPOSED TO BE IN THE BILL WE

00:57:05.489 --> 00:57:10.060 region:rollup2
KNOW THERE ARE FOLKS PUTTING.

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:11.561 region:rollup2
FLEETS ON THESE PLATFORMS.

00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:13.230 region:rollup2
HOW DOES THE SUPPLIER THEY

00:57:11.561 --> 00:57:14.665 region:rollup2
SUBJECT TO FEDERAL LAW THEY NOW

00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:16.633 region:rollup2
SUBJECT TO THIS LAW?

00:57:14.665 --> 00:57:18.168 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE HANDLE FLEETS MOVING

00:57:16.633 --> 00:57:20.671 region:rollup2
FORWARD AND IS THAT TRULY

00:57:18.168 --> 00:57:22.572 region:rollup2
PERSONAL VEHICLE SHARING WHEN

00:57:20.671 --> 00:57:24.074 region:rollup2
SOMEONE'S OFFERING FIVE TEN

00:57:22.572 --> 00:57:26.510 region:rollup2
VEHICLES? WHAT IF IT'S ONE

00:57:24.074 --> 00:57:28.211 region:rollup2
PERSON OFFERING ONE VEHICLE

00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:30.547 region:rollup2
THAT'S RENTED OUT THREE HUNDRED

00:57:28.211 --> 00:57:32.950 region:rollup2
AND SIXTY DAYS A YEAR? IS THAT

00:57:30.547 --> 00:57:34.451 region:rollup2
PERSONAL VEHICLE SHARING OR IS

00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:35.385 region:rollup2
THAT PERSONAL VEHICLE RENTAL.

00:57:34.451 --> 00:57:38.221 region:rollup2
AND SO THESE ARE ALL THE

00:57:35.385 --> 00:57:40.590 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT THAT WE HAVE WE

00:57:38.221 --> 00:57:41.959 region:rollup2
WE A APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR AND

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:42.426 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE IN THEIR DESIRE TO

00:57:41.959 --> 00:57:44.394 region:rollup2
PRESERVE THIS BROADER

00:57:42.426 --> 00:57:46.063 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION.

00:57:44.394 --> 00:57:48.231 region:rollup2
WE THINK IT'S A DISCUSSION THAT

00:57:46.063 --> 00:57:50.067 region:rollup2
THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN WE LOOK

00:57:48.231 --> 00:57:50.968 region:rollup2
FORWARD TO ENGAGING IN THAT. AND

00:57:50.067 --> 00:57:53.003 region:rollup2
WE WE.

00:57:50.968 --> 00:57:54.771 region:rollup2
ARE LOOKING AT THE BILL AND

00:57:53.003 --> 00:57:56.907 region:rollup2
TRYING TO EVALUATE WHETHER THE

00:57:54.771 --> 00:57:58.408 region:rollup2
BILL AS PROPOSED TODAY ACTUALLY

00:57:56.907 --> 00:57:59.309 region:rollup2
PREJUDICES THAT DISCUSSION

00:57:58.408 --> 00:58:01.511 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD.

00:57:59.309 --> 00:58:02.879 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:58:01.511 --> 00:58:03.680 region:rollup2
OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF

00:58:02.879 --> 00:58:04.648 region:rollup2
YOU COULD JUST GIVE YOUR NAME

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:05.849 region:rollup2
AND AFFILIATION PLEASE THAT JON

00:58:04.648 --> 00:58:09.720 region:rollup2
ROSS ON BEHALF OF THE HERTZ

00:58:05.849 --> 00:58:10.620 region:rollup2
CORPORATION IN OPPOSITION.

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:11.188 region:rollup2
MICHAEL YOUNG WITH THE

00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:12.055 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION

00:58:11.188 --> 00:58:14.124 region:rollup2
RUSSELL'S.

00:58:12.055 --> 00:58:15.192 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:58:14.124 --> 00:58:16.626 region:rollup2
BY THIS IS AN INTERESTING

00:58:15.192 --> 00:58:17.694 region:rollup2
SITUATION THAT WE FIND OURSELVES

00:58:16.626 --> 00:58:19.763 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE THERE ARE A

00:58:17.694 --> 00:58:20.664 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF AMENDMENTS

00:58:19.763 --> 00:58:22.032 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY IN THE

00:58:20.664 --> 00:58:23.767 region:rollup2
WORKS.

00:58:22.032 --> 00:58:24.601 region:rollup2
THAT WILL BE TAKEN I BELIEVE IN

00:58:23.767 --> 00:58:26.003 region:rollup2
THE NEXT COMMITTEE WHICH IS

00:58:24.601 --> 00:58:27.771 region:rollup2
PRIVACY.

00:58:26.003 --> 00:58:31.041 region:rollup2
AND MY HOPE IS THAT WE MOVE THIS

00:58:27.771 --> 00:58:32.576 region:rollup2
ALONG BUT I CAN ALSO APPRECIATE.

00:58:31.041 --> 00:58:34.077 region:rollup2
THE POSITION THAT THIS PUTS

00:58:32.576 --> 00:58:35.012 region:rollup2
EVERYONE AND SINCE WE SINCE WE

00:58:34.077 --> 00:58:36.246 region:rollup2
NOW HAVE NECESSARILY DEFINE IT

00:58:35.012 --> 00:58:37.714 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THE AMENDMENTS WILL DO

00:58:36.246 --> 00:58:39.783 region:rollup2
IS IS SIGNIFICANTLY SCALE THIS

00:58:37.714 --> 00:58:40.684 region:rollup2
BILL BACK.

00:58:39.783 --> 00:58:41.785 region:rollup2
AND THE REASON IS IN THE REASON

00:58:40.684 --> 00:58:43.120 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GO TO SOME OF THE

00:58:41.785 --> 00:58:45.489 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY THAT WAS TALK HERE

00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:46.023 region:rollup2
TODAY. BECAUSE THIS WAS BROUGHT

00:58:45.489 --> 00:58:47.557 region:rollup2
AND NO WAS BROUGHT TO THE

00:58:46.023 --> 00:58:48.191 region:rollup2
AUTHOR.

00:58:47.557 --> 00:58:49.526 region:rollup2
A LONG LINE OF PERSONAL VEHICLE

00:58:48.191 --> 00:58:52.462 region:rollup2
SHARE.

00:58:49.526 --> 00:58:54.197 region:rollup2
BUT IN FACT AS WE TALKED WITH

00:58:52.462 --> 00:58:56.533 region:rollup2
THE COMPANIES AS WE LOOKED AT

00:58:54.197 --> 00:58:58.335 region:rollup2
THE AT THE SITUATION. TURNS OUT

00:58:56.533 --> 00:59:00.504 region:rollup2
THAT THE PLATFORM'S TEND TO BE

00:58:58.335 --> 00:59:01.838 region:rollup2
USED MORE FOR FLEETS THAN FOR

00:59:00.504 --> 00:59:03.340 region:rollup2
PERSONAL VEHICLES ARE AND

00:59:01.838 --> 00:59:04.908 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE CREATED A STATUE FOR

00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:05.575 region:rollup2
PERSONAL VEHICLE SHARING.

00:59:04.908 --> 00:59:06.910 region:rollup2
AND WITH A STATUE FOR RENTAL CAR

00:59:05.575 --> 00:59:08.178 region:rollup2
COMPANIES

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:09.646 region:rollup2
THE OPPOSITION CORRECT THAT THAT

00:59:08.178 --> 00:59:12.048 region:rollup2
WE'RE WE'RE NOW BLENDING THESE

00:59:09.646 --> 00:59:13.784 region:rollup2
IN.

00:59:12.048 --> 00:59:15.285 region:rollup2
OR THE POTENTIAL FOR WHEN THIS

00:59:13.784 --> 00:59:17.053 region:rollup2
BILL FIRST CAME UP AS WELL AS MS

00:59:15.285 --> 00:59:18.989 region:rollup2
FRIEDMAN SPELL. KIND BLENDING

00:59:17.053 --> 00:59:21.124 region:rollup2
THESE TWO STATUTORY CONCEPTS IN

00:59:18.989 --> 00:59:22.492 region:rollup2
A IN AN AWKWARD WAY WITHOUT

00:59:21.124 --> 00:59:23.827 region:rollup2
REALLY HAVING THOUGHT IT THROUGH

00:59:22.492 --> 00:59:25.162 region:rollup2
AND SO IF THE PLATFORMS TRULY

00:59:23.827 --> 00:59:26.596 region:rollup2
FOR PERSONAL VEHICLE SHARING

00:59:25.162 --> 00:59:28.098 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE THING AND I THINK

00:59:26.596 --> 00:59:28.999 region:rollup2
THAT WAS WHAT THE AUTHOR'S

00:59:28.098 --> 00:59:30.500 region:rollup2
INTENT WAS I DON'T SPEAK FOR YOU

00:59:28.999 --> 00:59:31.001 region:rollup2
MISTER LOWE BUT WE YOU. AND I

00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:32.702 region:rollup2
HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

00:59:31.001 --> 00:59:33.937 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S CERTAINLY WHAT WHAT

00:59:32.702 --> 00:59:36.339 region:rollup2
WE ARE LOOKING AT WHEN THIS CAME

00:59:33.937 --> 00:59:38.508 region:rollup2
IN BUT THE MORE. THAT THE

00:59:36.339 --> 00:59:39.242 region:rollup2
PLATFORM IS TO SALUTED IN LARGE

00:59:38.508 --> 00:59:40.310 region:rollup2
FLEETS THE MORE IT LOOKS LIKE

00:59:39.242 --> 00:59:42.512 region:rollup2
RAILCAR COMPANY

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:43.980 region:rollup2
AND AND WHY WERE CONFUSING THE

00:59:42.512 --> 00:59:45.749 region:rollup2
TO AND CREATE A STATUTORY

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:46.349 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK THAT HAS TWO DIFFERENT

00:59:45.749 --> 00:59:47.818 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES TO BASICALLY DO THE

00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:49.052 region:rollup2
SAME BANG.

00:59:47.818 --> 00:59:50.854 region:rollup2
I I DON'T KNOW WHY WE WOULD

00:59:49.052 --> 00:59:51.455 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY DO THAT SO THERE'S A

00:59:50.854 --> 00:59:52.422 region:rollup2
LOT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO GET

00:59:51.455 --> 00:59:54.591 region:rollup2
DONE.

00:59:52.422 --> 00:59:55.792 region:rollup2
FROM MY STANDPOINT.

00:59:54.591 --> 00:59:57.527 region:rollup2
A VERY JUST IN THE PLATFORM AND

00:59:55.792 --> 00:59:59.329 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN THE POTENTIAL

00:59:57.527 --> 01:00:00.363 region:rollup2
AND WANT TO SEE THIS MOVE

00:59:59.329 --> 01:00:01.898 region:rollup2
FORWARD THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN AYE

01:00:00.363 --> 01:00:03.567 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION AND THAT'S BASED

01:00:01.898 --> 01:00:04.835 region:rollup2
ON A LOT OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT

01:00:03.567 --> 01:00:06.002 region:rollup2
THE AUTHOR IN HIS FRIEDMAN WHO

01:00:04.835 --> 01:00:07.671 region:rollup2
WAS. VERY MUCH A PART OF THIS

01:00:06.002 --> 01:00:10.073 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION BECAUSE HER BILL IS

01:00:07.671 --> 01:00:11.541 region:rollup2
APROPOS TO THIS.

01:00:10.073 --> 01:00:13.977 region:rollup2
REALLY LEND TO THAT TO THAT

01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:15.545 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WE NEED TO WHATEVER

01:00:13.977 --> 01:00:17.280 region:rollup2
WE DO BUILDING IN.

01:00:15.545 --> 01:00:19.049 region:rollup2
CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IS

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:20.383 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IN THIS CONVERSATION

01:00:19.049 --> 01:00:21.718 region:rollup2
AND HENCE THE RECALL PROVISIONS

01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:22.986 region:rollup2
THAT WILL STAY HERE AND AND

01:00:21.718 --> 01:00:24.654 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE OF THE. IMPORTANT

01:00:22.986 --> 01:00:25.655 region:rollup2
PIECES THAT THAT'S GOING TO MOVE

01:00:24.654 --> 01:00:27.224 region:rollup2
FORWARD BUT I THINK THIS

01:00:25.655 --> 01:00:28.725 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO GET A

01:00:27.224 --> 01:00:30.760 region:rollup2
BETTER HANDLE ON HOW THESE

01:00:28.725 --> 01:00:33.597 region:rollup2
PLATFORMS ARE ACTUALLY BEING.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:34.831 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY REPRESENTS AND PERHAPS

01:00:33.597 --> 01:00:36.233 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD BE TALKING TO THE

01:00:34.831 --> 01:00:37.734 region:rollup2
RENTAL CAR COMPANIES ABOUT?

01:00:36.233 --> 01:00:38.802 region:rollup2
THEIR BUSINESS PRACTICES WHERE

01:00:37.734 --> 01:00:40.103 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD LIKE TO GO BECAUSE

01:00:38.802 --> 01:00:42.606 region:rollup2
THEY OBVIOUSLY COME TO THIS

01:00:40.103 --> 01:00:44.641 region:rollup2
TABLE WITH A WHOLE HISTORY. OF

01:00:42.606 --> 01:00:46.376 region:rollup2
STATUTORY. AND REGULATORY

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:47.210 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIONS AND CONVERSATIONS

01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:47.711 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE BUILT UP OVER THE

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:50.113 region:rollup2
YEARS NOW THERE'S A NEW

01:00:47.711 --> 01:00:51.114 region:rollup2
PLATFORM.

01:00:50.113 --> 01:00:52.015 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T WANNA GET IN THE

01:00:51.114 --> 01:00:54.050 region:rollup2
MIDDLE OF THE COMPETITION THAT

01:00:52.015 --> 01:00:55.852 region:rollup2
THIS REPRESENTS NOR DO WE GET

01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:58.054 region:rollup2
ONE TO GET IN THE MIDDLE. OF THE

01:00:55.852 --> 01:01:00.223 region:rollup2
EXISTING LAWSUIT THAT IS OUT

01:00:58.054 --> 01:01:01.424 region:rollup2
THERE BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND

01:01:00.223 --> 01:01:03.093 region:rollup2
THE AIRPORT AND I'M NOT SURE ALL

01:01:01.424 --> 01:01:04.594 region:rollup2
THAT THE THE PARTIES ARE THAT'S

01:01:03.093 --> 01:01:06.129 region:rollup2
NOT THE INTENT AND. THIS

01:01:04.594 --> 01:01:07.197 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR

01:01:06.129 --> 01:01:10.133 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO PASS

01:01:07.197 --> 01:01:11.935 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION THAT INTERFERES WITH

01:01:10.133 --> 01:01:13.303 region:rollup2
OR DIRECT THE COURT'S BORN

01:01:11.935 --> 01:01:14.838 region:rollup2
EXISTING LITIGATION IF THERE'S

01:01:13.303 --> 01:01:16.339 region:rollup2
THE. LITIGATION THAT NEEDS TO

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:18.275 region:rollup2
GET SORTED OUT IF WE DISAGREE

01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:19.809 region:rollup2
WITH THE RESULT WE THEN HAVE THE

01:01:18.275 --> 01:01:21.278 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO COME AND INSTRUCT

01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:23.380 region:rollup2
THE COURT. THROUGH OUR NORMAL

01:01:21.278 --> 01:01:24.981 region:rollup2
PROCESS IS THIS IS HOW WE THINK

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:26.683 region:rollup2
YOU GOT THAT WRONG. BUT WE

01:01:24.981 --> 01:01:28.251 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T BE SET UP TO TO TRY

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:31.221 region:rollup2
AND INTERFERE. THE AMENDMENTS

01:01:28.251 --> 01:01:32.289 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO SORT OF RESET ALL

01:01:31.221 --> 01:01:33.223 region:rollup2
OF THAT TAKE IT BACK TO ITS

01:01:32.289 --> 01:01:34.658 region:rollup2
SIMPLEST FORM.

01:01:33.223 --> 01:01:37.027 region:rollup2
AND THE REASON THAT THIS COULD

01:01:34.658 --> 01:01:39.563 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION NEEDS TO MOVE FORWARD

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:41.231 region:rollup2
IS THAT WE WE NEED THE TIME AND

01:01:39.563 --> 01:01:42.799 region:rollup2
WE NEED THE SPACE TO BE ABLE TO

01:01:41.231 --> 01:01:44.334 region:rollup2
DISCUSS. THESE THESE NEW

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:46.202 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORKS WHERE THESE PERSONAL

01:01:44.334 --> 01:01:48.238 region:rollup2
VEHICLE SHARING.

01:01:46.202 --> 01:01:49.372 region:rollup2
PLATFORMS ARE NOW BEING USED

01:01:48.238 --> 01:01:51.241 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE USED

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:52.542 region:rollup2
FOR AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT

01:01:51.241 --> 01:01:55.045 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY MOVING TO FLEET

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:56.746 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS IS A BAD THING.

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:58.582 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE STATUTE

01:01:56.746 --> 01:02:00.417 region:rollup2
WAS CREATED FOR IT WAS CREATED

01:01:58.582 --> 01:02:02.319 region:rollup2
FOR PERSONAL VEHICLE SHARE.

01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:04.220 region:rollup2
AND WE EITHER HONOR THAT OR WE

01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:04.854 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM AND

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:07.224 region:rollup2
TRY AND CREATE A BETTER

01:02:04.854 --> 01:02:09.159 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK FOR VEHICLES TO BE

01:02:07.224 --> 01:02:09.993 region:rollup2
SHARED WHETHER ITS THROUGH.

01:02:09.159 --> 01:02:13.063 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT LOOKS MORE LIKE

01:02:09.993 --> 01:02:15.198 region:rollup2
RENTAL CAR COMPANIES OR THROUGH.

01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:16.766 region:rollup2
INNOVATIVE APPS THAT THAT MAY OR

01:02:15.198 --> 01:02:17.968 region:rollup2
MAY NOT BE OUT THERE.

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:19.436 region:rollup2
ALL THAT THE ABOUT SO THAT'S

01:02:17.968 --> 01:02:21.605 region:rollup2
KIND OF WHERE WE ARE.

01:02:19.436 --> 01:02:23.139 region:rollup2
IT'S AN INTERESTING PROCESS

01:02:21.605 --> 01:02:24.541 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN VERY ENGAGED IN THIS

01:02:23.139 --> 01:02:26.309 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHY I'D LIKE TO SEE

01:02:24.541 --> 01:02:28.278 region:rollup2
IT MOVE FORWARD DOES ENJOY DO

01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:29.312 region:rollup2
PASS. RECOMMENDATION WITHOUT THE

01:02:28.278 --> 01:02:30.247 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS BECAUSE WE JUST

01:02:29.312 --> 01:02:30.880 region:rollup2
DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET ALL OF

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:32.682 region:rollup2
THAT IN THIS WAS.

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:34.017 region:rollup2
A MOVING.

01:02:32.682 --> 01:02:35.919 region:rollup2
HARD IT'S I DON'T EVER WANT TO

01:02:34.017 --> 01:02:38.255 region:rollup2
SAY TRUST ME AND YOU DON'T HAVE

01:02:35.919 --> 01:02:39.656 region:rollup2
TO TRUST US ON THIS. BUT.

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:41.258 region:rollup2
THERE HAS BEEN ALL OUT BATTLE LA

01:02:39.656 --> 01:02:42.759 region:rollup2
WORKED AND THERE'LL BE A LOT OF

01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:44.461 region:rollup2
WORK DONE IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:46.763 region:rollup2
AND I THINK. GETTING OUR HANDS

01:02:44.461 --> 01:02:48.531 region:rollup2
AROUND THIS SLOWING IT DOWN SO

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:49.899 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN HAVE A REAL

01:02:48.531 --> 01:02:51.601 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ABOUT IMPACTS IS.

01:02:49.899 --> 01:02:53.603 region:rollup2
IS WHAT WE'RE ABOUT AT THIS

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:54.170 region:rollup2
POINT.

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:55.505 region:rollup2
SO QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISTER

01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:56.439 region:rollup2
CHIU.

01:02:55.505 --> 01:02:57.974 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LET ME

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:59.909 region:rollup2
FIRST START BY THANKING YOU FOR

01:02:57.974 --> 01:03:01.478 region:rollup2
THAT. NOT GOOD SUMMARY OF WHERE

01:02:59.909 --> 01:03:04.014 region:rollup2
WE ARE I DO THINK THIS

01:03:01.478 --> 01:03:05.248 region:rollup2
OF BILL BRINGS UP A A NUMBER OF

01:03:04.014 --> 01:03:06.950 region:rollup2
FASCINATING ISSUES THAT.

01:03:05.248 --> 01:03:08.351 region:rollup2
AS THE LEGISLATURE WE OUGHT TO

01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:08.918 region:rollup2
GRAPPLE WITH I DO HAVE A

01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:11.121 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:13.790 region:rollup2
RELATED TO THE LAWSUIT THAT MY

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:15.725 region:rollup2
CITY I HAS BROUGHT AGAINST TORO.

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:16.493 region:rollup2
AND I JUST WANT TO READ PARTS

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:18.261 region:rollup2
OF THE ANALYSIS.

01:03:16.493 --> 01:03:19.496 region:rollup2
IT.

01:03:18.261 --> 01:03:21.498 region:rollup2
INITIALLY IS DRAFTED.

01:03:19.496 --> 01:03:23.266 region:rollup2
AS A STATE IN THE ANALYSIS.

01:03:21.498 --> 01:03:25.435 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW.

01:03:23.266 --> 01:03:26.503 region:rollup2
THE THE BILL WAS INTENDED TO DO

01:03:25.435 --> 01:03:28.004 region:rollup2
ANYTHING OTHER THAN INTERFERE

01:03:26.503 --> 01:03:29.673 region:rollup2
WITH THE PENDING LITIGATION AND

01:03:28.004 --> 01:03:31.141 region:rollup2
THAT'S HOW IT'S DRAFTED BUT THAT

01:03:29.673 --> 01:03:32.742 region:rollup2
BEING SAID MY UNDERSTANDING IS.

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:33.376 region:rollup2
THAT THE AUTHORS PROPOSED

01:03:32.742 --> 01:03:35.779 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS.

01:03:33.376 --> 01:03:37.080 region:rollup2
DOES REFLECT THE AUTHOR'S

01:03:35.779 --> 01:03:38.748 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT TO AVOID INTERFERING

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:40.583 region:rollup2
WITH THE PENDING LITIGATION WITH

01:03:38.748 --> 01:03:41.451 region:rollup2
THIS BILL AND INSTEAD TO PROCEED

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:43.019 region:rollup2
WITH RELATIVELY NON

01:03:41.451 --> 01:03:45.021 region:rollup2
CONTROVERSIAL PROVISIONS.

01:03:43.019 --> 01:03:46.556 region:rollup2
ON SAFETY RECALL I JUST WANT TO.

01:03:45.021 --> 01:03:48.358 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND ON THE RECORD THAT

01:03:46.556 --> 01:03:49.926 region:rollup2
THAT IS YOUR INTENT YOU'RE NOT

01:03:48.358 --> 01:03:50.994 region:rollup2
TRYING TO IMPACT THE LAWSUIT

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:52.362 region:rollup2
BETWEEN MY CITY AND.

01:03:50.994 --> 01:03:53.730 region:rollup2
AND TOWARD THE STOCK THAT IS

01:03:52.362 --> 01:03:55.231 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY CORRECT AND OUT WITH

01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:57.133 region:rollup2
THE INDULGENCE OF THE CHAIR AND

01:03:55.231 --> 01:03:58.902 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH A KEY STAKEHOLDERS

01:03:57.133 --> 01:04:00.103 region:rollup2
THAT IS CERTAINLY THE INTENT AND

01:03:58.902 --> 01:04:01.771 region:rollup2
THE BUT THE LANGUAGE THAT WE

01:04:00.103 --> 01:04:04.574 region:rollup2
HAVE. IS JUST SPECIFICALLY ON

01:04:01.771 --> 01:04:06.343 region:rollup2
THAT OF OF THE RECALL. TO INSURE

01:04:04.574 --> 01:04:08.778 region:rollup2
THAT CONSUMERS ARE PROTECTED IN

01:04:06.343 --> 01:04:10.246 region:rollup2
THAT TRANSPORTATION OF THAT IS

01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:12.315 region:rollup2
THAT IS CONVENE THROUGH THIS

01:04:10.246 --> 01:04:13.483 region:rollup2
APPLICATION IS ALSO SUBJECTED TO

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:15.452 region:rollup2
THE SAME PROTECTIONS IN PLACE

01:04:13.483 --> 01:04:16.753 region:rollup2
FOR CONSUMERS WITH RESPECT TO

01:04:15.452 --> 01:04:18.455 region:rollup2
RECALL SO IT'S VERY NARROW IN

01:04:16.753 --> 01:04:20.390 region:rollup2
SCOPE. AND AGAIN W. DUE RESPECT

01:04:18.455 --> 01:04:22.225 region:rollup2
THAT OF THE LAWSUIT AND DO NOT

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:23.226 region:rollup2
WANT TO HAVE ANY TYPE OF THE

01:04:22.225 --> 01:04:24.928 region:rollup2
PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WE GET

01:04:23.226 --> 01:04:25.762 region:rollup2
AND IN THE WAY OF THAT. I

01:04:24.928 --> 01:04:27.497 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THAT AND.

01:04:25.762 --> 01:04:29.032 region:rollup2
AND AND AND CERTAINLY MY

01:04:27.497 --> 01:04:29.799 region:rollup2

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:31.201 region:rollup2
BILL AND AND YOU'RE

01:04:29.799 --> 01:04:33.236 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATION AND ALSO THIS

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:34.304 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS. UP MAKES

01:04:33.236 --> 01:04:36.172 region:rollup2
ME FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT THAT IS

01:04:34.304 --> 01:04:36.773 region:rollup2
THE CASE IF IT TURNS OUT AT SOME

01:04:36.172 --> 01:04:38.541 region:rollup2
POINT DOWN THE LINE IN THE

01:04:36.773 --> 01:04:39.142 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THERE ARE

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:40.076 region:rollup2
SOME WHO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED

01:04:39.142 --> 01:04:41.845 region:rollup2
TO.

01:04:40.076 --> 01:04:43.513 region:rollup2
CLARIFY THIS MORE EXPLICITLY ARE

01:04:41.845 --> 01:04:45.915 region:rollup2
YOU YOU OPEN TO LANGUAGE IN THE

01:04:43.513 --> 01:04:46.583 region:rollup2

AND OF THE ANSWERS THAT WAS SO

01:05:17.781 --> 01:05:22.652 region:rollup2
LOW. UP MY I THINK OF THAT THAT

01:05:20.216 --> 01:05:24.354 region:rollup2
THE. THE CHAIR APPROPRIATELY HOW

01:05:22.652 --> 01:05:25.221 region:rollup2
THE CONVERSATIONS TO REMOVE THAT

01:05:24.354 --> 01:05:27.323 region:rollup2
ASPECT.

01:05:25.221 --> 01:05:28.458 region:rollup2
AT THAT THE LITIGATION ASPECT

01:05:27.323 --> 01:05:30.560 region:rollup2
FROM THE BILL THAT I THINK WOULD

01:05:28.458 --> 01:05:30.794 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN TROUBLESOME FOR. MANY

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:35.498 region:rollup2
OF US.

01:05:30.794 --> 01:05:36.533 region:rollup2
AND. IT LOOKS TO ME THAT.

01:05:35.498 --> 01:05:37.801 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS AGREED UPON WHICH

01:05:36.533 --> 01:05:39.269 region:rollup2
WILL BEGIN AYE MATCH BEFORE. THE

01:05:37.801 --> 01:05:41.037 region:rollup2
FORGET TO PRIVACY.

01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:43.173 region:rollup2
AND I'M COMFORTABLE IN IN

01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:44.641 region:rollup2
TRUSTING THE WORK OF THE CHAIR

01:05:43.173 --> 01:05:45.809 region:rollup2
AND AND MR LOW ON THAT.

01:05:44.641 --> 01:05:46.876 region:rollup2
YEAH I THINK THAT.

01:05:45.809 --> 01:05:49.179 region:rollup2
HOME.

01:05:46.876 --> 01:05:50.680 region:rollup2
.

01:05:49.179 --> 01:05:52.582 region:rollup2

01:05:52.582 --> 01:05:56.219 region:rollup2
AND.

01:05:54.384 --> 01:05:58.788 region:rollup2
THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE MISTER

01:05:56.219 --> 01:06:00.957 region:rollup2
CHAIR IS THE. I'M I'M YOU SPOKE

01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:03.426 region:rollup2

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:04.427 region:rollup2
DISCONTINUED TO BE WORKED ON.

01:06:03.426 --> 01:06:06.362 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S NOT THE CONTEMPLATION

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:07.831 region:rollup2
THAT WILL BE DONE THIS INTO THIS

01:06:06.362 --> 01:06:10.200 region:rollup2
BILL BUT THAT IN GENERAL.

01:06:07.831 --> 01:06:11.568 region:rollup2

CONVERSATIONS WILL CONTINUE

01:06:13.770 --> 01:06:17.006 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF THE PAYMENT OF THIS

01:06:14.737 --> 01:06:18.308 region:rollup2
BILL YES THAT IS VERY GOOD POINT

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:19.809 region:rollup2
GOOD QUESTION. THAT IS MEANT TO

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:21.778 region:rollup2
HAPPEN OUTSIDE THE FRAMEWORK OF

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:23.913 region:rollup2
THIS BILL THIS BILL BECAUSE OF

01:06:21.778 --> 01:06:25.148 region:rollup2
WHERE WE ARE. IS REALLY JUST

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:26.950 region:rollup2
GOING TO DEAL WITH THE RECALL

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:29.519 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS THAT'S THAT'S WHAT'S

01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:30.220 region:rollup2

01:06:29.519 --> 01:06:31.387 region:rollup2
SIMPLIFIED BILL.

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:32.655 region:rollup2
I DO APOLOGIZE THAT NOT

01:06:31.387 --> 01:06:34.557 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY HAS SEEN THOSE

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:35.959 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS THEY'VE BEEN SORT OF

01:06:34.557 --> 01:06:37.594 region:rollup2
FAST AND FURIOUS AND THANKS TO

01:06:35.959 --> 01:06:39.729 region:rollup2
MY STAFF THE AUTHOR STAFF IS

01:06:37.594 --> 01:06:40.597 region:rollup2
FRIEDMAN STAFF FOR HELPING US TO

01:06:39.729 --> 01:06:41.998 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE WE GOT THIS IN A

01:06:40.597 --> 01:06:43.433 region:rollup2
POSITION. WHERE WE'RE

01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:44.801 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLE?

01:06:43.433 --> 01:06:46.436 region:rollup2
IT DOES FEEL LIKE A WORK IN

01:06:44.801 --> 01:06:48.037 region:rollup2
PROGRESS IT IS WEIRD FACT

01:06:46.436 --> 01:06:49.472 region:rollup2
RELYING ON THE NEXT COMMITTEE TO

01:06:48.037 --> 01:06:51.174 region:rollup2
SOLIDIFY THAT PARTICULAR

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:52.675 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT BUT THAT BEING SAID I

01:06:51.174 --> 01:06:53.910 region:rollup2
IT IS A VERY INTERESTING AND

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:55.445 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO

01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:56.613 region:rollup2
BE DISCUSSED THAT. AND I'M

01:06:55.445 --> 01:06:58.381 region:rollup2
HOPING I'M ASSUMING THAT WILL

01:06:56.613 --> 01:07:00.850 region:rollup2
SEE A A BROADER BILL OR ANOTHER

01:06:58.381 --> 01:07:03.419 region:rollup2
BILL. FOR A COUPLE BILLS PERHAPS

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:05.688 region:rollup2
NEXT YEAR. WE HAVE THE SUMMER WE

01:07:03.419 --> 01:07:07.023 region:rollup2
HAVE THE FALL TO TO DRILL DOWN

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:08.958 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THAT.

01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:11.261 region:rollup2
WE GET A A A BETTER SENSE OF IT

01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:13.196 region:rollup2
ONE THE FRUSTRATIONS WAS AS WE

01:07:11.261 --> 01:07:14.931 region:rollup2
WERE INVESTIGATING THIS.

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:16.432 region:rollup2
WE KEPT FINDING OUT ALMOST DAILY

01:07:14.931 --> 01:07:18.067 region:rollup2
NEW INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE

01:07:16.432 --> 01:07:19.903 region:rollup2
PLATFORM WAS BEING USED WHAT THE

01:07:18.067 --> 01:07:21.571 region:rollup2
STATISTICS WERE WHO WERE USING

01:07:19.903 --> 01:07:23.172 region:rollup2
IT WHAT THE TRENDS WERE WAS VERY

01:07:21.571 --> 01:07:25.241 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAT. INFORMATION AS

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:26.109 region:rollup2
IT CAME IN THAT WAS TROUBLING.

01:07:25.241 --> 01:07:29.412 region:rollup2
AND SINCE THAT'S THE CASE I

01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:30.713 region:rollup2
THINK WE DO NEED THE TIME TO.

01:07:29.412 --> 01:07:32.515 region:rollup2
REALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT THOSE

01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:34.284 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS ARE IF WE'RE GOING TO

01:07:32.515 --> 01:07:36.019 region:rollup2
LEGISLATE AND THEN UNDERSTAND

01:07:34.284 --> 01:07:37.220 region:rollup2
IMPACTS ON RENTAL CARS NOT

01:07:36.019 --> 01:07:38.688 region:rollup2
RENTAL CARS PERSONAL VEHICLES

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:40.523 region:rollup2
FLEETS.

01:07:38.688 --> 01:07:41.524 region:rollup2
IT THAT'S ALL UP IN THE AIR SO

01:07:40.523 --> 01:07:43.726 region:rollup2
THE BEST ANSWER FOR US.

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:45.695 region:rollup2
AND THE ENDS.

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:47.463 region:rollup2
I RESPECT WITH FOR THE AUTHOR.

01:07:45.695 --> 01:07:49.499 region:rollup2
WE COULD HAVE JUST.

01:07:47.463 --> 01:07:51.067 region:rollup2
STOP THIS WHOLE THING TODAY THAT

01:07:49.499 --> 01:07:53.069 region:rollup2
WAS NOT MY DESIRE BECAUSE.

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:55.572 region:rollup2
MOVING THIS BILL AS IT IS IT IT

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:57.640 region:rollup2
WILL ACCOMPLISH IMPORTANT.

01:07:55.572 --> 01:07:59.442 region:rollup2
CONSUMER SAFETY OF PROTECTIONS

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:01.110 region:rollup2
BUT IT ALSO IS AN INDICATION OF

01:07:59.442 --> 01:08:03.079 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE'S WILLINGNESS TO

01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:04.747 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE BROADER ISSUE AND

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:06.382 region:rollup2
FIND SOME SOLUTIONS OF FIGURE

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:08.384 region:rollup2
OUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO SO ON THE

01:08:06.382 --> 01:08:09.619 region:rollup2
BILL WAS FIRST PASSED.

01:08:08.384 --> 01:08:11.387 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES WERE

01:08:09.619 --> 01:08:13.323 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFERENT WE IT'S IT'S NOW

01:08:11.387 --> 01:08:15.425 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT LANDSCAPE WE HAVE TO

01:08:13.323 --> 01:08:16.326 region:rollup2
BE RESPONSIVE TO THAT YEAH BUT I

01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:17.994 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THAT THE THIS

01:08:16.326 --> 01:08:19.963 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS WERE GRAPPLING ACROSS

01:08:17.994 --> 01:08:22.098 region:rollup2
MANY PLATFORMS AS WE'VE SEEN

01:08:19.963 --> 01:08:24.300 region:rollup2
THAT THE ORIGINAL. INTENTION OF

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:25.835 region:rollup2
BILLS NO MORE AS THE

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:27.870 region:rollup2
CAPABILITIES OF MANY

01:08:25.835 --> 01:08:28.805 region:rollup2
APPLICATIONS AND PLATFORMS

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:30.406 region:rollup2
CHANGE AS WELL.

01:08:28.805 --> 01:08:32.942 region:rollup2
GET OF I THINK ONE OF THE

01:08:30.406 --> 01:08:34.544 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT WAS RAISED BY THE

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:35.878 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND PRIZE HOLDINGS IS.

01:08:34.544 --> 01:08:37.880 region:rollup2
DOES THE BILL PREJUDICE

01:08:35.878 --> 01:08:38.481 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION I DON'T BELIEVE A

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:40.249 region:rollup2
DOZEN THINGS BEEN NARROWED

01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:41.818 region:rollup2
ENOUGH TO FOCUS ON THE SAFETY

01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:43.586 region:rollup2
RECALL CONSUMER PROTECTION

01:08:41.818 --> 01:08:44.988 region:rollup2
ASPECT. AND I THINK THE

01:08:43.586 --> 01:08:45.555 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION IS ONE THAT SEEMS

01:08:44.988 --> 01:08:47.223 region:rollup2
LIKE EVERYONE IS WILLING TO

01:08:45.555 --> 01:08:49.092 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:08:47.223 --> 01:08:50.126 region:rollup2
SEPARATE FROM THIS BILL AND IF

01:08:49.092 --> 01:08:51.494 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE CASE AND I'M

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:52.495 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY CAN'T HOLDING FOR WITH

01:08:51.494 --> 01:08:55.565 region:rollup2
THE BILL AND AND THAT IS THE

01:08:52.495 --> 01:08:59.335 region:rollup2
CASE. THANK YOU. RIGHT OTHER

01:08:55.565 --> 01:09:01.337 region:rollup2

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:07.477 region:rollup2
LABOR AND THAT I TAKE THEIR

01:09:05.408 --> 01:09:08.845 region:rollup2

COMPLAINTS AGAINST A TEACHER

01:15:08.738 --> 01:15:11.941 region:rollup2
WERE BURIED ALLOWING ADDITIONAL

01:15:10.539 --> 01:15:13.409 region:rollup2
STUDENTS TO BE VICTIMIZED.

01:15:11.941 --> 01:15:15.011 region:rollup2
THESE CASES SHOW HOW PREVALENT

01:15:13.409 --> 01:15:16.345 region:rollup2
CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE SAYS WITH

01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:17.880 region:rollup2
TWENTY PERCENT OF ADULT WOMEN IN

01:15:19.115 --> 01:15:22.284 region:rollup2
ABUSE.

01:15:20.716 --> 01:15:24.020 region:rollup2
THESE CASES SHOW HOW PREVALENT

01:15:22.284 --> 01:15:25.154 region:rollup2
COVER UPS ARE BY ENTITIES AND

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:26.722 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS IN A POSITION OF

01:15:25.154 --> 01:15:28.891 region:rollup2
POWER WHO EITHER CHOOSE TO TURN

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:29.258 region:rollup2
A BLIND EYE OR ARE ACTIVELY

01:15:28.891 --> 01:15:31.327 region:rollup2
PROTECTING THIS

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:32.762 region:rollup2
PREDATORS.

01:15:31.327 --> 01:15:34.063 region:rollup2
THEY ALSO HIGHLIGHT THAT EACH

01:15:32.762 --> 01:15:35.598 region:rollup2
VICTIM'S DECISION OF WHETHER TO

01:15:34.063 --> 01:15:37.066 region:rollup2
COME FORWARD PUBLICLY OR TO

01:15:35.598 --> 01:15:38.300 region:rollup2
PURSUE LEGAL REMEDIES IS

01:15:37.066 --> 01:15:40.069 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AND HAPPENS AT THEIR

01:15:40.069 --> 01:15:43.305 region:rollup2
TRAUMA SHAME AND FEAR ARE JUST A

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:45.274 region:rollup2
FEW OF THE REASONS THAT IT CAN

01:15:43.305 --> 01:15:46.909 region:rollup2
TAKE VICTIMS DECADES BEFORE

01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:48.644 region:rollup2
WANTING TO CONFRONT. OR EVEN

01:15:46.909 --> 01:15:50.813 region:rollup2

CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULTS.

01:15:50.813 --> 01:15:54.717 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IT'S SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:56.685 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SOMEBODY IS IN THEIR MID

01:15:54.717 --> 01:15:58.120 region:rollup2

TRAUMATIZING THAT WILL TELL THEM

01:16:02.358 --> 01:16:05.027 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN ONLY PURSUE CIVIL

01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:06.529 region:rollup2
REMEDIES IF THEY CAN PROVE THAT

01:16:05.027 --> 01:16:07.797 region:rollup2
THEY HAD REPRESS THOSE MEMORIES

01:16:06.529 --> 01:16:09.498 region:rollup2

ON BEHALF OF VICTIMS.

01:16:45.134 --> 01:16:47.670 region:rollup2
AS A TEENAGER I WAS SEXUALLY

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:49.105 region:rollup2
ASSAULTED BY THE CHOIR DIRECTOR

01:16:47.670 --> 01:16:50.206 region:rollup2
AT MY HIGH SCHOOL.

01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:51.707 region:rollup2
HE DELIBERATELY TARGETED ME

01:16:50.206 --> 01:16:53.909 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I WAS VULNERABLE.

01:16:51.707 --> 01:16:55.044 region:rollup2
HE KNEW I WAS POWERLESS.

01:16:53.909 --> 01:16:57.313 region:rollup2

01:17:09.225 --> 01:17:12.394 region:rollup2

01:17:12.394 --> 01:17:16.365 region:rollup2

SCHOOL PROPERTY AND ELSEWHERE.

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:19.635 region:rollup2
BY THE TIME I GRADUATED HIGH

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:23.639 region:rollup2
SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE.

01:17:21.971 --> 01:17:25.274 region:rollup2
LIKE MOST VICTIMS I LIVE WITH

01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:27.476 region:rollup2
CRIPPLING SHAME AND SECRECY FROM

01:17:25.274 --> 01:17:30.045 region:rollup2
MORE THAN A DECADE.

01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:31.313 region:rollup2
BUT I'M ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES.

01:17:30.045 --> 01:17:32.481 region:rollup2
I DEVOTED MY CAREER TO BEING A

01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:34.817 region:rollup2
VOICE AND A SOURCE OF

01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:36.752 region:rollup2
EMPOWERMENT FOR OTHER SURVIVORS

01:17:34.817 --> 01:17:39.088 region:rollup2

01:17:36.752 --> 01:17:40.456 region:rollup2
THEIR SHAME.

01:17:39.088 --> 01:17:41.790 region:rollup2
CHILD SEXUAL ASSAULT IS

01:17:40.456 --> 01:17:43.459 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER FORM OF

01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:45.828 region:rollup2
PREDATORY BEHAVIOR.

01:17:43.459 --> 01:17:48.764 region:rollup2
NO OTHER ASSAULT SILENCES ITS

SURVIVORS CALL WHEN THEY COME

01:17:51.467 --> 01:17:54.036 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

01:17:52.935 --> 01:17:55.871 region:rollup2
MOST ARE WELL INTO THEIR

01:17:54.036 --> 01:17:57.406 region:rollup2
THIRTIES AND FORTIES.

01:17:55.871 --> 01:17:59.375 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE BURDEN OF SHAME OF

01:17:57.406 --> 01:18:01.043 region:rollup2
CHILD SEXUAL ASSAULT.

01:17:59.375 --> 01:18:02.344 region:rollup2
THAT SEAMUS SO DEEP IN FACT A

01:18:01.043 --> 01:18:03.145 region:rollup2
VICTIM WILL NOT EVEN TELL THEIR

01:18:02.344 --> 01:18:04.847 region:rollup2
LIFE PARTNER UNTIL THEIR

01:18:03.145 --> 01:18:06.682 region:rollup2
THIRTIES AND FORTIES.

01:18:04.847 --> 01:18:08.784 region:rollup2
YET AN ARTIFICIAL DEADLINE THAT

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:09.285 region:rollup2
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS EXPECTS

01:18:08.784 --> 01:18:11.420 region:rollup2
THEM TO BE READY DECADES

01:18:09.285 --> 01:18:13.455 region:rollup2
EARLIER.

01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:16.225 region:rollup2
I AM NOT A FAMOUS PERSON.

01:18:13.455 --> 01:18:18.727 region:rollup2
I'M NOT A MOVIE STAR NOR GYMNAST

01:18:16.225 --> 01:18:20.095 region:rollup2
I'M NOT A C. E. O. OR CELEBRITY.

01:18:18.727 --> 01:18:22.498 region:rollup2
BUT IS KNOW LESS ON ME WHEN

01:18:20.095 --> 01:18:24.633 region:rollup2
HARVEY WEINSTEIN OR ROY MOORE OR

01:18:22.498 --> 01:18:26.702 region:rollup2
LARRY NASSER CUT A SWATH OF

01:18:24.633 --> 01:18:28.771 region:rollup2
SEXUAL ASSAULT ACROSS OUR MOST

01:18:26.702 --> 01:18:30.339 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS.

01:18:28.771 --> 01:18:32.141 region:rollup2
IT IS NO LESSON ME TO STAND

01:18:30.339 --> 01:18:34.777 region:rollup2
HERE BEFORE YOU AND SAY THAT OUR

01:18:32.141 --> 01:18:36.111 region:rollup2
LAW MUST CHANGE.

01:18:34.777 --> 01:18:37.580 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SEEN A COMPLETESHIFT IN

01:18:36.111 --> 01:18:39.615 region:rollup2
OUR CULTURE WHEN IT COMES TO HOW

01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:40.716 region:rollup2
WE VIEW CHILD SEXUAL ASSAULT.

01:18:39.615 --> 01:18:42.851 region:rollup2
IT IS TIME TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:44.386 region:rollup2
CULTURAL SHIFT.

01:18:42.851 --> 01:18:46.422 region:rollup2
WE MUST ALLOW VICTIMS TO COME

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:46.956 region:rollup2
FORWARD WHEN THEY ARE READY.

01:18:46.422 --> 01:18:48.591 region:rollup2
I WAS NOT READY WHEN I WAS

01:18:46.956 --> 01:18:51.026 region:rollup2
NINETEEN.

01:18:48.591 --> 01:18:52.328 region:rollup2
MOST VICTIMS WHEN THEY CALL ME

01:18:51.026 --> 01:18:53.662 region:rollup2
HAVE NO RECOURSE AT ALL.

01:18:52.328 --> 01:18:55.798 region:rollup2
THAT MUST CHANGE.

01:22:03.519 --> 01:22:07.489 region:rollup2
AND THE APPLICATION PROCESS

01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:10.025 region:rollup2
REQUIRES THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO

01:22:07.489 --> 01:22:11.894 region:rollup2
HAVE A CODE OF CONDUCT IN PLACE.

CONTRACTORS OF VOLUNTEERS AND

01:22:36.485 --> 01:22:39.588 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN ZERO PAUL OF TOLERANCE.

01:22:38.153 --> 01:22:41.356 region:rollup2
.

01:22:39.588 --> 01:22:42.624 region:rollup2
A POLICY TOWARD CHILD ABUSE.

01:22:41.356 --> 01:22:44.526 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE NUMBER OF

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:45.794 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS I MEAN THERE ARE

01:22:44.526 --> 01:22:47.095 region:rollup2
HIGH PROFILE IT'S INCIDENTS AND

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:49.064 region:rollup2
THERE'S TOO MANY. BUT.

01:22:47.095 --> 01:22:50.766 region:rollup2
YOU GOTTA BELIEVE THAT THESE

01:22:49.064 --> 01:22:53.068 region:rollup2
KINDS OF POLICIES AND ENSURES

01:22:50.766 --> 01:22:54.803 region:rollup2
THAT. NO REALLY EDUCATE AND

01:22:53.068 --> 01:22:56.338 region:rollup2
TEACH ORGANIZATIONS OF THAT THIS

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:57.673 region:rollup2
IS WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO I THINK

01:22:56.338 --> 01:22:59.808 region:rollup2
HELP PREVENT THESE TYPES OF

01:22:57.673 --> 01:23:00.776 region:rollup2
THINGS REMEMBER CURRENT. AND

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:03.312 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULD BE THE GOAL.

01:23:00.776 --> 01:23:04.780 region:rollup2
IN OUR VIEW JUST ELIMINATING THE

01:23:03.312 --> 01:23:06.915 region:rollup2
OF THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS.

01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:08.917 region:rollup2
BEFORE LAWSUITS AGAINST

01:23:06.915 --> 01:23:10.052 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS I'M IS GOING TO MAKE

01:23:08.917 --> 01:23:12.020 region:rollup2
IT MORE THAN LIKELY VERY

01:23:10.052 --> 01:23:13.789 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE FOR

01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:15.457 region:rollup2
INSURERS TO OFFER THIS COVERAGE.

01:23:13.789 --> 01:23:16.558 region:rollup2
AT BEST THE PRICES GO UP WHEN

01:23:15.457 --> 01:23:18.560 region:rollup2
THE COVER COVERAGE GIVES

01:23:16.558 --> 01:23:19.628 region:rollup2
RESTRICTED AT WORSE IS GOING TO

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:21.163 region:rollup2
BE NO COVERAGE AT ALL.

01:23:19.628 --> 01:23:22.564 region:rollup2
.

01:23:21.163 --> 01:23:22.931 region:rollup2
AND WE DON'T THINK THAT'S A

01:23:22.564 --> 01:23:25.501 region:rollup2
POSITIVE THING.

01:23:22.931 --> 01:23:26.568 region:rollup2
.

01:23:25.501 --> 01:23:28.403 region:rollup2
WE THINK WITH REGARD TO THE

01:23:26.568 --> 01:23:30.639 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER THERE HAS TO BE SOME

01:23:28.403 --> 01:23:32.307 region:rollup2
TIME PERIOD WHEN THERE'S NOT AN

01:23:30.639 --> 01:23:33.942 region:rollup2
UNRESTRICTED RIGHT TO COME AFTER

01:23:32.307 --> 01:23:35.944 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYER SO THE INSURER HAS

01:23:33.942 --> 01:23:38.080 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE. TO KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT

01:23:35.944 --> 01:23:39.781 region:rollup2
THE LIKELIHOOD OF LAWSUITS ARE

01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:41.783 region:rollup2
TODAY THAT NUMBER IS TWENTY SIX

01:23:39.781 --> 01:23:43.452 region:rollup2
YEARS OLD AND AFTER THAT.

01:23:41.783 --> 01:23:45.287 region:rollup2
THE CLAIMANT HAS.

01:23:43.452 --> 01:23:46.555 region:rollup2
WITHIN THREE YEARS OF THE TIME

01:23:45.287 --> 01:23:48.056 region:rollup2
THEY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN

01:23:46.555 --> 01:23:50.259 region:rollup2
OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THEIR

01:23:48.056 --> 01:23:51.326 region:rollup2
ABUSE SEND. AND THEIR DAMAGES

01:23:50.259 --> 01:23:53.362 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW TO BRING A LAWSUIT

01:23:51.326 --> 01:23:55.030 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY CAN SHOW THE EMPLOYER

01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:57.533 region:rollup2
KNEW SOMETHING FAILED TO TAKE

01:23:55.030 --> 01:24:00.068 region:rollup2
ACTION WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE.

01:23:57.533 --> 01:24:02.104 region:rollup2
IS TWENTY SIX THE MAGIC NUMBER

01:24:00.068 --> 01:24:03.438 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE WHO KNOWS I MEAN

01:24:02.104 --> 01:24:05.274 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT STATES HAVE DIFFERENT

01:24:03.438 --> 01:24:06.174 region:rollup2
NUMBERS IT COULD BE THIRTY IT

01:24:05.274 --> 01:24:08.510 region:rollup2
COULD BE THIRTY FIVE WHATEVER IT

01:24:06.174 --> 01:24:09.811 region:rollup2
IS. BUT AT SOME POINT TO ENSURE

01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:12.714 region:rollup2
CONCERNED CHOOSE WHAT HASN'T

01:24:09.811 --> 01:24:13.382 region:rollup2
HAPPENED HERE THEN THE NEXT STEP

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:15.317 region:rollup2
IS THAT.

01:24:13.382 --> 01:24:17.452 region:rollup2
NO THEY HAVE TO SHOW THIS SO

01:24:15.317 --> 01:24:19.254 region:rollup2
REDUCES THE CHANCE AND YOU CAN

01:24:17.452 --> 01:24:21.757 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SAY WELL WE CAN MOVE

01:24:19.254 --> 01:24:22.391 region:rollup2
RESERVES OR WHATEVER THE CASE

01:24:21.757 --> 01:24:23.926 region:rollup2
MAY BASE I THINK.

01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:25.694 region:rollup2
IT'S ALL ABOUT BALANCE OF HAVING

01:24:23.926 --> 01:24:28.096 region:rollup2
SOME BALLOTS CERTAINLY YOU WANT

01:24:25.694 --> 01:24:29.665 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY OF CLAIMANTS TO.

01:24:28.096 --> 01:24:32.467 region:rollup2
GO AFTER PEOPLE THAT.

01:24:29.665 --> 01:24:34.136 region:rollup2
THEM FROM THAT CREATED ARAFAT

01:24:32.467 --> 01:24:35.671 region:rollup2
ALLOWED FOR HARM BUT THE SAME

01:24:34.136 --> 01:24:38.040 region:rollup2
TIME YOU WANT THAT COVERAGE TO

01:24:35.671 --> 01:24:39.441 region:rollup2
BE AVAILABLE BECAUSE IT IT DOES

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:41.476 region:rollup2
SOMETHING VERY POSITIVE IN TERMS

01:24:39.441 --> 01:24:43.045 region:rollup2
OF TEACHING ORGANIZATIONS. WHAT

01:24:41.476 --> 01:24:44.947 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TO DO TO PREVENT THIS

01:24:43.045 --> 01:24:46.949 region:rollup2
SO WE SHARE THOSE CONCERNS WHAT

01:24:44.947 --> 01:24:47.916 region:rollup2

CONTINUE WORKING WITH THERE IS

01:24:50.485 --> 01:24:54.323 region:rollup2
THIS BILL MOVES AS WE EXPECTED

01:24:52.054 --> 01:24:54.856 region:rollup2
TO DO BUT FOR RIGHT NOW WE STILL

01:24:54.323 --> 01:24:56.525 region:rollup2

THIS THIS IS A TOUGH SITUATION

01:30:42.370 --> 01:30:46.708 region:rollup2
THAT THE FACT THAT THE PREVIOUS

01:30:44.539 --> 01:30:48.276 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE DID SOMETHING DOES

01:30:46.708 --> 01:30:49.978 region:rollup2
NOT ACTUALLY BY OUR HANDS.

01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:50.679 region:rollup2
NO TIRE HANDS AT ANY POINT RIGHT

01:30:49.978 --> 01:30:52.647 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:30:50.679 --> 01:30:54.015 region:rollup2
AND.

01:30:52.647 --> 01:30:55.583 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT IS TO LISTEN

01:30:54.015 --> 01:30:57.218 region:rollup2
TO.

01:30:55.583 --> 01:30:59.287 region:rollup2
THE TESTIMONY OF THOSE WHO HAVE

01:30:57.218 --> 01:31:01.022 region:rollup2
BEEN AFFECTED AND THE TIMELINE

01:30:59.287 --> 01:31:02.824 region:rollup2
SO THEY THEY FACE THEMSELVES

01:31:01.022 --> 01:31:04.326 region:rollup2
UNDER AND. IT'S AN UNFORTUNATE

01:31:02.824 --> 01:31:06.728 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCE OF OUR JURISPRUDENCE

01:31:04.326 --> 01:31:08.463 region:rollup2
SYSTEM. THAT WE SEEM TO SAY YES

01:31:06.728 --> 01:31:10.899 region:rollup2

LIFE HAS BEEN RUINED HERE'S A

01:31:12.534 --> 01:31:15.103 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OF MONEY THAT MAKES

01:31:13.735 --> 01:31:16.838 region:rollup2
IT ALL. BETTER.

01:31:15.103 --> 01:31:18.540 region:rollup2
AND IF THAT'S GOING TO BE THE

01:31:16.838 --> 01:31:20.375 region:rollup2
CASE THAT WE JUST THEN I THINK

01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:21.843 region:rollup2
IT'S INCOME ON US TEN TO MAKE

01:31:20.375 --> 01:31:23.278 region:rollup2
SURE WE SET UP A SYSTEM.

01:31:21.843 --> 01:31:25.480 region:rollup2
THAT TRULY THAT. THAT REGRETS

01:31:23.278 --> 01:31:26.681 region:rollup2
AND.

01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:28.016 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS OF THE

01:31:26.681 --> 01:31:29.184 region:rollup2

01:31:28.016 --> 01:31:30.118 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMPANY BUT THE FACT

01:31:29.184 --> 01:31:31.886 region:rollup2
OF THE MATTER IS THESE

01:31:30.118 --> 01:31:33.355 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE FOSTERED

01:31:31.886 --> 01:31:35.523 region:rollup2
THAT HAD FUELED THAT HAD. LOOK

01:31:33.355 --> 01:31:36.458 region:rollup2
THE OTHER WAY WHEN PEOPLE WERE

01:31:35.523 --> 01:31:38.460 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY BEING ABUSE.

01:31:36.458 --> 01:31:39.394 region:rollup2
AND.

01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:41.663 region:rollup2
THEY MAY END UP BEING THE DEEP

01:31:39.394 --> 01:31:43.631 region:rollup2
POCKETS BUT OUR SYSTEM IS TO SAY

01:31:41.663 --> 01:31:45.367 region:rollup2

HERE'S A BUNCH OF MONEY AND I

01:31:45.367 --> 01:31:49.104 region:rollup2
THINK WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL.

01:31:47.268 --> 01:31:50.972 region:rollup2
PUTTING TO ANY LIMITATIONS ON

01:31:49.104 --> 01:31:52.674 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY RECOVER SEEK THE

01:31:50.972 --> 01:31:53.241 region:rollup2
HELP THAT'S NECESSARY AND AND

01:31:52.674 --> 01:31:56.478 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD WITH SOMEONE'S%

01:31:53.241 --> 01:31:58.079 region:rollup2
LIVES SO FROM MY STANDPOINT.

01:31:56.478 --> 01:31:59.447 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS BILL IS WORTHY OF

01:31:58.079 --> 01:32:00.982 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD I CERTAINLY DO

01:31:59.447 --> 01:32:02.450 region:rollup2

01:32:09.691 --> 01:32:13.762 region:rollup2

VICTIMS ACROSS OUR SYSTEM.

01:32:16.064 --> 01:32:20.068 region:rollup2
OTHER QUESTIONS.

01:32:18.533 --> 01:32:22.771 region:rollup2
COVENS.

01:32:20.068 --> 01:32:23.671 region:rollup2

WEBER. NOTES OKAY IT'S IT'S A

01:32:36.117 --> 01:32:38.486 region:rollup2
QUICK QUESTION I KNOW THAT.

01:32:37.252 --> 01:32:40.655 region:rollup2
OF ONE OF THE WITNESSES TALKED

01:32:38.486 --> 01:32:42.123 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE BURDEN BILL AND HOW.

01:32:40.655 --> 01:32:44.259 region:rollup2
REOPENING THE STATUTE OF

01:32:42.123 --> 01:32:46.227 region:rollup2
LIMITATIONS.

01:32:44.259 --> 01:32:47.796 region:rollup2
APPLIED TO PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS

01:32:46.227 --> 01:32:49.330 region:rollup2
BUT YOUR BILL.

01:32:47.796 --> 01:32:51.032 region:rollup2
ALSO INCLUDES PUBLIC AS WELL AS

01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:52.434 region:rollup2
PRIDE.

01:32:51.032 --> 01:32:53.401 region:rollup2
LOOK I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

01:32:52.434 --> 01:32:54.869 region:rollup2
WE'VE LEARNED.

01:32:53.401 --> 01:32:55.437 region:rollup2
PROBABLY OVER I DON'T THINK THE

01:32:54.869 --> 01:32:57.038 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR MAYBE THE LAST SIX

01:32:55.437 --> 01:32:59.107 region:rollup2
MONTHS.

01:32:57.038 --> 01:33:01.643 region:rollup2
IS THAT PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS HAVE

01:32:59.107 --> 01:33:03.278 region:rollup2
BEEN AS BAD IF NOT WORSE ACTORS

01:33:01.643 --> 01:33:04.813 region:rollup2
THAN PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS WHEN

01:33:03.278 --> 01:33:06.581 region:rollup2
IT COMES TO ISSUES.

01:33:04.813 --> 01:33:08.183 region:rollup2
REGARDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT

01:33:06.581 --> 01:33:09.918 region:rollup2
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND YES OUR OUR

01:33:08.183 --> 01:33:10.585 region:rollup2
OUR CHILDREN.

01:33:09.918 --> 01:33:13.521 region:rollup2
AND I THINK.

01:33:10.585 --> 01:33:14.656 region:rollup2
TO SHIELD OURSELVES SIMPLY

01:33:13.521 --> 01:33:16.858 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IS A PUBLIC

01:33:14.656 --> 01:33:19.861 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION IS ALLY

01:33:16.858 --> 01:33:21.729 region:rollup2
BANKRUPT QUITE FRANKLY AND TO

01:33:19.861 --> 01:33:23.731 region:rollup2
SAY THAT YOU KNOW I'M. IN THE

01:33:21.729 --> 01:33:25.433 region:rollup2
SAME WAY THAT A PRIVATE EMPLOYER

01:33:23.731 --> 01:33:27.168 region:rollup2
IF AN EMPLOYER WAS NEGLIGENT AND

01:33:25.433 --> 01:33:28.636 region:rollup2
ALLOWED ABUSE TO CONTINUE TO

01:33:27.168 --> 01:33:29.637 region:rollup2
HAPPEN THIS HAPPEN IN A SCHOOL

01:33:28.636 --> 01:33:31.239 region:rollup2
IN SAN DIEGO.

01:33:29.637 --> 01:33:32.040 region:rollup2
I'M SURE IT'S HAPPENED ITS

01:33:31.239 --> 01:33:34.142 region:rollup2
MOTHER SCHOOLS THERE SHOULD

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:35.777 region:rollup2
STILL BE REQUEST THAT VICTIM IS

01:33:34.142 --> 01:33:37.278 region:rollup2
NO LESS VICTIMIZED.

01:33:35.777 --> 01:33:40.014 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE.

01:33:37.278 --> 01:33:40.915 region:rollup2
HARASSER OR THE ASSAULT HER ON

01:33:40.014 --> 01:33:42.784 region:rollup2
WHAT SOMEBODY WHO WORK FOR A

01:33:40.915 --> 01:33:43.985 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AGENCY SO I THINK AND

01:33:42.784 --> 01:33:45.053 region:rollup2
GIVEN QUITE FRANKLY THE

01:33:43.985 --> 01:33:46.721 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S VETO OF.

01:33:45.053 --> 01:33:47.489 region:rollup2
THE LAST ITERATION OF KIND OF

01:33:46.721 --> 01:33:49.157 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:33:47.489 --> 01:33:49.624 region:rollup2
THIS MOVING AROUND THE STATUE

01:33:49.157 --> 01:33:52.026 region:rollup2
BILL.

01:33:49.624 --> 01:33:53.394 region:rollup2
WHERE WHERE HE EXPRESSED

01:33:52.026 --> 01:33:56.464 region:rollup2
CONCERN?

01:33:53.394 --> 01:33:57.132 region:rollup2
THAT WERE WERE NOT INCLUDING

01:33:56.464 --> 01:33:58.900 region:rollup2
OUR THAT WE WERE.

01:33:57.132 --> 01:33:59.767 region:rollup2
POINTING ONLY TO PRIVATE

01:33:58.900 --> 01:34:01.202 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS I THINK IT'S SOMETHING

01:33:59.767 --> 01:34:02.937 region:rollup2
WE HAVE COME TO TERMS WITH MY TO

01:34:01.202 --> 01:34:04.105 region:rollup2
BE EXPENSIVE IT MIGHT BE. BUT

01:34:02.937 --> 01:34:05.640 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO THE HEALTH AND

01:34:04.105 --> 01:34:07.242 region:rollup2
WELFARE OF OUR CHILDREN IF IT

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:08.810 region:rollup2
COMES TO ACTUALLY PREVENTING

01:34:07.242 --> 01:34:10.245 region:rollup2
THIS IN THE FUTURE IF PUBLIC

01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:11.012 region:rollup2
AGENCIES KNOW THAT FOR EVER.

01:34:10.245 --> 01:34:13.348 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WILL BE.

01:34:11.012 --> 01:34:15.617 region:rollup2
IMMUNE TO TO BEING HELD

01:34:13.348 --> 01:34:16.684 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS TYPE OF

01:34:15.617 --> 01:34:18.453 region:rollup2
LOOKING THE OTHER WAY AND I'M

01:34:16.684 --> 01:34:19.020 region:rollup2
SORRY IT'S IT'S UNFORTUNATE BUT

01:34:18.453 --> 01:34:21.322 region:rollup2
WHEN PRINCIPALS AND SCHOOL

01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:24.192 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS CONTINUE TO DO THAT.

01:34:21.322 --> 01:34:25.894 region:rollup2
WE PROVIDED NO NO REAL

01:34:24.192 --> 01:34:27.295 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE TO STOP THIS ACTION IF

01:34:25.894 --> 01:34:28.830 region:rollup2
WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT PROTECTING

01:34:27.295 --> 01:34:29.731 region:rollup2
CHILDREN I THINK THAT WE OPEN

01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:30.965 region:rollup2
THIS UP TO EVERYBODY.

01:34:29.731 --> 01:34:33.468 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:34:30.965 --> 01:34:35.003 region:rollup2
IF YOU.

01:34:33.468 --> 01:34:37.338 region:rollup2
THIS WEBER YES I DIDN'T GET THE

01:34:35.003 --> 01:34:37.872 region:rollup2
LETTER FROM THE ACLU SO COULD

01:34:37.338 --> 01:34:40.108 region:rollup2
SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT THE

01:34:37.872 --> 01:34:40.742 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION WHAT. WE FEEL YOU MY

01:34:40.108 --> 01:34:42.677 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING IS.

01:34:40.742 --> 01:34:44.445 region:rollup2
THAT AND SHE CAN COME SPEAK UP

01:34:42.677 --> 01:34:45.480 region:rollup2
BUT IT WAS THE OPEN ENDED NATURE

01:34:44.445 --> 01:34:47.348 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE OF HAVING NO

01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:48.349 region:rollup2
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS UP AND

01:34:47.348 --> 01:34:50.985 region:rollup2
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT A FEW OF

01:34:48.349 --> 01:34:51.986 region:rollup2
YOU I I HAVE. TALKED TO OUT MORE

01:34:50.985 --> 01:34:53.888 region:rollup2
WILLING TO WORK ON.

01:34:51.986 --> 01:34:55.223 region:rollup2
IT BEING OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SOME

01:34:53.888 --> 01:34:56.291 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE NOT SHARED WITH A FEW

01:34:55.223 --> 01:34:58.026 region:rollup2
OF THE POSSIBLE AMENDMENTS NEXT

01:34:56.291 --> 01:35:00.195 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE ON TO HAVING NO

01:34:58.026 --> 01:35:02.030 region:rollup2
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS BUT SHE

01:35:00.195 --> 01:35:02.997 region:rollup2
CAN SPEAK.

01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:04.966 region:rollup2
SO IT WAS INTRODUCED TO THE

01:35:02.997 --> 01:35:06.568 region:rollup2
COULD BE BIRTHPLACE YA I I THINK

01:35:04.966 --> 01:35:08.536 region:rollup2
THAT THAT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

01:35:06.568 --> 01:35:09.938 region:rollup2
THE BOTH THE LIMIT COMPLETE

01:35:08.536 --> 01:35:11.906 region:rollup2
ELIMINATION OF THE STATUTE OF

01:35:09.938 --> 01:35:13.208 region:rollup2
LIMITATIONS AND THEN. ALSO THE

01:35:11.906 --> 01:35:14.976 region:rollup2
ELIMINATION OF SOME OF THE OTHER

01:35:13.208 --> 01:35:16.911 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS THAT ARE IN THE LONG

01:35:14.976 --> 01:35:19.147 region:rollup2
NOW WHEN PEOPLE DO BRING THE

01:35:16.911 --> 01:35:22.483 region:rollup2
DELAYED DISCOVERY CASES.

01:35:19.147 --> 01:35:24.185 region:rollup2
IT ASKING THE COURT TO I DO AN

01:35:22.483 --> 01:35:25.453 region:rollup2
INITIAL FINDING OF MERIT AND

01:35:24.185 --> 01:35:27.221 region:rollup2
KEEPING THE PERSON THE

DEFENDANT'S NAME.

01:35:27.221 --> 01:35:31.526 region:rollup2
FROM FROM BEING REVEALED UNTIL

01:35:30.091 --> 01:35:33.027 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN SOME SHELLING OF

01:35:31.526 --> 01:35:33.661 region:rollup2
CORROBORATIVE EVIDENCE WE THINK

01:35:33.027 --> 01:35:36.197 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE IMPORTANT.

01:35:33.661 --> 01:35:36.731 region:rollup2
DUE PROCESS SAFEGUARDS FOR

01:35:36.197 --> 01:35:40.768 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO MAY BE FALSELY

01:35:36.731 --> 01:35:41.936 region:rollup2

01:35:44.472 --> 01:35:46.708 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT BECAUSE

01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:48.576 region:rollup2
I WAS ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAD

01:35:46.708 --> 01:35:50.011 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG. IT COULD

01:35:48.576 --> 01:35:51.512 region:rollup2
BE AND IF THERE ARE FOLKS WHO

01:35:50.011 --> 01:35:53.781 region:rollup2
DON'T REMEMBER AND ALL KINDS OF

01:35:51.512 --> 01:35:55.783 region:rollup2
THINGS MUCH LATER ON I COULD SEE

01:35:53.781 --> 01:35:58.119 region:rollup2
IT BECOMING QUITE A ISSUE.

01:35:55.783 --> 01:36:00.421 region:rollup2
YEAH OKAY THANK YOU. BUT YOU'RE

01:35:58.119 --> 01:36:03.191 region:rollup2
WORKING ON THOSE THREATS ACCOUNT

01:36:00.421 --> 01:36:04.659 region:rollup2
SORRY IS WEBER OKAY ISRAEL.

01:36:03.191 --> 01:36:05.360 region:rollup2
I DO WANT TO GO BACK TO THE

01:36:04.659 --> 01:36:07.295 region:rollup2
BURDEN.

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:08.963 region:rollup2
BILL THAT.

01:36:07.295 --> 01:36:10.598 region:rollup2
STEP THAT STATUTE LIMITATIONS

01:36:08.963 --> 01:36:11.1000 region:rollup2
SOME I KNOW THAT.

01:36:10.598 --> 01:36:13.468 region:rollup2
THERE WERE EMPLOYERS

01:36:11.1000 --> 01:36:15.436 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY CHURCHES.

01:36:13.468 --> 01:36:17.505 region:rollup2
WHO RESOLVED A NUMBER OF

01:36:15.436 --> 01:36:20.708 region:rollup2
DISPUTES THERE?

01:36:17.505 --> 01:36:22.443 region:rollup2
THE THE SPECIFIC ISSUE OF.

01:36:20.708 --> 01:36:24.545 region:rollup2
COVER UP WITHOUT A DOUBT NEEDS

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:27.382 region:rollup2
TO BE INCLUDED.

01:36:24.545 --> 01:36:30.218 region:rollup2
I I I HOPE THOUGH THAT THE.

01:36:27.382 --> 01:36:31.953 region:rollup2
WHEN WE DEAL WITH EMPLOYERS AND

01:36:30.218 --> 01:36:33.254 region:rollup2
OF THE THE OPEN ENDED ASPECT OF

01:36:31.953 --> 01:36:34.555 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:36:33.254 --> 01:36:35.890 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WERE SOME CONTINUE

01:36:34.555 --> 01:36:37.959 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION WITH EMPLOYERS

01:36:35.890 --> 01:36:39.394 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY THAT THAT IS ONE

01:36:37.959 --> 01:36:41.396 region:rollup2
THING AND THEN I ALSO HAD THE

01:36:39.394 --> 01:36:43.631 region:rollup2
CONCERNED WITH THE ACLU TO TO

01:36:41.396 --> 01:36:46.768 region:rollup2
SEE THEIR OPPOSITION TO THIS.

01:36:43.631 --> 01:36:50.872 region:rollup2
WAS SURPRISING TO ME.

01:36:46.768 --> 01:36:52.874 region:rollup2
SO CLEARLY ANOTHER ENTITY THAT.

01:36:50.872 --> 01:36:53.541 region:rollup2
SO THAT.

01:36:52.874 --> 01:36:54.475 region:rollup2
AND IT WASN'T WRITING TO ME TOO

01:36:53.541 --> 01:36:56.077 region:rollup2
BUT I'M WILLING OBVIOUSLY TO

01:36:54.475 --> 01:36:57.679 region:rollup2
WORK ON THEIR CONCERNS IT I'M

01:36:56.077 --> 01:36:59.047 region:rollup2
AYE AYE.

01:36:57.679 --> 01:37:00.315 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT SOMETHING ALONG

01:36:59.047 --> 01:37:02.116 region:rollup2
WITH WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED ABOUT

01:37:00.315 --> 01:37:02.283 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD VERY I REITERATE

01:37:02.116 --> 01:37:04.552 region:rollup2
MY.

01:37:02.283 --> 01:37:06.621 region:rollup2
.

01:37:04.552 --> 01:37:08.022 region:rollup2
MY COMMITMENT TO VICTIMS TO NOT

01:37:06.621 --> 01:37:08.723 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATE WITH ARE VICTIMIZERS

01:37:08.022 --> 01:37:10.792 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK.

01:37:08.723 --> 01:37:12.460 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE

01:37:10.792 --> 01:37:14.896 region:rollup2
WE CAN HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH.

01:37:12.460 --> 01:37:16.431 region:rollup2
TO TO PUT.

01:37:14.896 --> 01:37:16.898 region:rollup2
SOME CONSTRAINTS ON THE SPELL TO

01:37:16.431 --> 01:37:18.900 region:rollup2
MAKE PEOPLE FEEL MORE

01:37:16.898 --> 01:37:21.969 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLE.

01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:22.804 region:rollup2
IS TO MAINTAIN.

01:37:21.969 --> 01:37:25.640 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

01:37:22.804 --> 01:37:26.407 region:rollup2
A FEW THINGS OUT FIRST THAT AND

01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:27.709 region:rollup2
THINK THIS IMPORTANT BILL I

01:37:26.407 --> 01:37:28.976 region:rollup2
THINK YOU FOR BRINGING AT MISS

01:37:27.709 --> 01:37:30.812 region:rollup2
GONZALEZ FLETCHER.

01:37:28.976 --> 01:37:32.680 region:rollup2
JUST A COUPLE THINGS IN IT AND

01:37:30.812 --> 01:37:34.716 region:rollup2
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS THAT AT A

01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:36.184 region:rollup2
SEVERAL TIMES. AND I APPRECIATE

01:37:34.716 --> 01:37:37.752 region:rollup2
YOUR COMMITMENT TO WORKING ON

01:37:36.184 --> 01:37:38.920 region:rollup2
THESE I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT

01:37:37.752 --> 01:37:40.288 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S BALANCING SOME

01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:41.689 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED ISSUES THESE DUE

01:37:40.288 --> 01:37:44.325 region:rollup2
PROCESS ISSUES.

01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:45.960 region:rollup2
WITH AN OBVIOUS NEED AT THAT

01:37:44.325 --> 01:37:47.729 region:rollup2
THE REALITY IN THESE SITUATIONS

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:49.931 region:rollup2
IS THAT.

01:37:47.729 --> 01:37:51.833 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE VERY REAL MEMORY

01:37:49.931 --> 01:37:52.800 region:rollup2
ISSUES THESE DON'T. IT'S NOT A

01:37:51.833 --> 01:37:54.469 region:rollup2
TYPICAL CASE WHERE YOU HAVE AN

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:56.738 region:rollup2
ACT.

01:37:54.469 --> 01:37:57.505 region:rollup2
THAT OCCURS.

01:37:56.738 --> 01:37:58.773 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ROBBING A BANK OR

01:37:57.505 --> 01:38:00.141 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THERE'S A PHYSICAL ACT

01:37:58.773 --> 01:38:00.975 region:rollup2
THAT OCCURS AND THEN YOU HAVE A

01:38:00.141 --> 01:38:02.410 region:rollup2
CERTAIN LENGTH OF TIME THE

01:38:00.975 --> 01:38:04.112 region:rollup2
PROSECUTION WANT FIRST HAS

01:38:02.410 --> 01:38:05.713 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY THAT TIME WITHIN WHICH

01:38:04.112 --> 01:38:07.081 region:rollup2
TO BRING THAT SUIT. THIS THIS IS

01:38:05.713 --> 01:38:08.716 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT BECAUSE PEOPLE MAY NOT

01:38:07.081 --> 01:38:10.118 region:rollup2
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED UNTIL

01:38:08.716 --> 01:38:12.487 region:rollup2
MANY MANY YEARS LATER.

01:38:10.118 --> 01:38:15.123 region:rollup2
IN IT AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT

01:38:12.487 --> 01:38:16.457 region:rollup2
PRECISE YEAR IS IS PROBABLY

01:38:15.123 --> 01:38:19.093 region:rollup2
SPECULATIVE TO SOME EXTENT.

01:38:16.457 --> 01:38:20.995 region:rollup2
BUT IT CERTAINLY IS BEYOND.

01:38:19.093 --> 01:38:22.463 region:rollup2
CHILD THAT IT CERTAINLY BEYOND

01:38:20.995 --> 01:38:26.367 region:rollup2
YOUNG ADULTHOOD.

01:38:22.463 --> 01:38:27.668 region:rollup2
AND SO I I I THINK THAT I.

01:38:26.367 --> 01:38:28.770 region:rollup2
IN JUST TO CONFIRM I THINK

01:38:27.668 --> 01:38:29.570 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GONNA WORK ON THESE TO

01:38:28.770 --> 01:38:31.105 region:rollup2
THE KIND OF THIS DUE PROCESS

01:38:29.570 --> 01:38:32.039 region:rollup2
BALANCE AT SOME OF THE ISSUES

01:38:31.105 --> 01:38:33.474 region:rollup2
THAT THE ACLU BROUGHT.

01:38:32.039 --> 01:38:35.209 region:rollup2
.

01:38:33.474 --> 01:38:36.577 region:rollup2
RE OPENING PASSED CLAIMS YOU

01:38:35.209 --> 01:38:38.045 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT'S THE.

01:38:36.577 --> 01:38:41.082 region:rollup2
THE.

01:38:38.045 --> 01:38:42.383 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU BALANCE SORT OF THIS?

01:38:41.082 --> 01:38:44.485 region:rollup2
RESOLUTION THAT A HUGE

01:38:42.383 --> 01:38:46.120 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE OF THESE HAVE BEEN.

01:38:44.485 --> 01:38:48.122 region:rollup2
RESOLVED AND MOVED ON WITH

01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:49.323 region:rollup2
MEMORY ISSUES CA AYE AYE AYE

01:38:48.122 --> 01:38:49.957 region:rollup2
SOME TO AND I SEE THE NODDING

01:38:49.323 --> 01:38:51.793 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO

01:38:49.957 --> 01:38:52.160 region:rollup2
WORK ON THAT. AND ALSO TO

01:38:51.793 --> 01:38:53.561 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT.

01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:55.463 region:rollup2
.

01:38:53.561 --> 01:38:56.597 region:rollup2
MAYBE COULD COMMENT ON ITS IS

01:38:55.463 --> 01:38:58.566 region:rollup2
AND I THINK AND IT YOU MAY FORTY

01:38:56.597 --> 01:39:00.134 region:rollup2
DOWN THIS THE THAT THAT ISSUE OF

01:38:58.566 --> 01:39:01.035 region:rollup2
STATE LICENSING. YET WANT TO

01:39:00.134 --> 01:39:02.570 region:rollup2
COMMENT ON THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:39:01.035 --> 01:39:04.872 region:rollup2
FIX THAT WE HAD A DISCUSSION

01:39:02.570 --> 01:39:06.340 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY SO WHERE

01:39:04.872 --> 01:39:07.408 region:rollup2
WHERE WE'RE GONNA FIX THAT IS AS

01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:08.576 region:rollup2
WELL AS.

01:39:07.408 --> 01:39:09.444 region:rollup2
I AM VERY GOOD THEN I I THINK

01:39:08.576 --> 01:39:10.478 region:rollup2
THIS IMPORTANT THINK IT'S

01:39:09.444 --> 01:39:11.779 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED I'M GLAD YOU'RE

01:39:10.478 --> 01:39:12.847 region:rollup2
GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT BUT

01:39:11.779 --> 01:39:14.816 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT.

01:39:12.847 --> 01:39:15.416 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULD MOVE OUT OF THIS

01:39:14.816 --> 01:39:16.551 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE SUB SUPPORT IT TODAY

01:39:15.416 --> 01:39:17.919 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:39:16.551 --> 01:39:19.887 region:rollup2
THANK YOU WAS GOING TO HAVE.

01:39:17.919 --> 01:39:21.289 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

01:39:19.887 --> 01:39:22.723 region:rollup2
I AM SORT OF OF THE MINDSET.

01:39:21.289 --> 01:39:25.126 region:rollup2
.

01:39:22.723 --> 01:39:26.661 region:rollup2
THAT THE WITNESS EXPRESSED.

01:39:25.126 --> 01:39:27.795 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO THE ACTUAL

01:39:26.661 --> 01:39:29.730 region:rollup2
PERPETRATOR OF THESE HEINOUS

01:39:27.795 --> 01:39:32.633 region:rollup2
ACTS.

01:39:29.730 --> 01:39:33.201 region:rollup2
I I I PERCENT NO PROBLEM WITH

01:39:32.633 --> 01:39:34.702 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY WAVING THE STATS

01:39:33.201 --> 01:39:36.571 region:rollup2
LIMITATION.

01:39:34.702 --> 01:39:38.506 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IT OCCURS TO ME THAT.

01:39:36.571 --> 01:39:40.241 region:rollup2
THE PERPETRATORS OFTEN.

01:39:38.506 --> 01:39:42.076 region:rollup2
DO NOT HAVE ASSETS.

01:39:40.241 --> 01:39:43.778 region:rollup2
SO.

01:39:42.076 --> 01:39:46.180 region:rollup2
I SEE THE NEED FOR POTENTIALLY

01:39:43.778 --> 01:39:47.014 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT OTHER SOURCES.

01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:48.683 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYER WHERE THE EMPLOYER

01:39:47.014 --> 01:39:49.984 region:rollup2
HAD KNOWLEDGE.

01:39:48.683 --> 01:39:52.119 region:rollup2
OR CONSTRUCTIVE KNOWLEDGE.

01:39:49.984 --> 01:39:55.156 region:rollup2
.

01:39:52.119 --> 01:39:56.657 region:rollup2
I AM CONCERNED THOUGH ABOUT.

01:39:55.156 --> 01:39:58.359 region:rollup2
THE EFFECT OF THIS IF WE

01:39:56.657 --> 01:39:59.894 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY OPEN UP.

01:39:58.359 --> 01:40:01.696 region:rollup2
ALL PAST CLIENTS WITH NO STATUTE

01:39:59.894 --> 01:40:03.564 region:rollup2
FOR EMPLOYERS.

01:40:01.696 --> 01:40:04.498 region:rollup2
OUT WILL THE EFFECT OF THAT ON

01:40:03.564 --> 01:40:06.434 region:rollup2
ENSURE ABILITY.

01:40:04.498 --> 01:40:08.669 region:rollup2
.

01:40:06.434 --> 01:40:11.138 region:rollup2
SO I WAS WONDERING IF IT AUTHOR

01:40:08.669 --> 01:40:13.174 region:rollup2
OR OR THE WITNESS COULD EXPOUND

01:40:11.138 --> 01:40:14.909 region:rollup2
ON THAT A LITTLE BIT I MEAN.

01:40:13.174 --> 01:40:16.410 region:rollup2
WHAT IT IS OF PERSON IF YOU

01:40:14.909 --> 01:40:17.078 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE?

01:40:16.410 --> 01:40:20.381 region:rollup2
ANY SUCH LIMITATIONS.

01:40:17.078 --> 01:40:22.416 region:rollup2
.

01:40:20.381 --> 01:40:23.751 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD TO QUANTIFY RISK THAT.

01:40:22.416 --> 01:40:25.019 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW FAR

01:40:23.751 --> 01:40:26.554 region:rollup2
BACK THE CLAIMS MIGHT GO AND

01:40:25.019 --> 01:40:28.289 region:rollup2
THEN. I'D I DON'T WANNA BE IN A

01:40:26.554 --> 01:40:30.525 region:rollup2
SITUATION WHERE WE'RE TRYING.

01:40:28.289 --> 01:40:32.927 region:rollup2
TO HELP THESE VICTIMS.

01:40:30.525 --> 01:40:34.562 region:rollup2
I WHICH REQUIRES SOME.

01:40:32.927 --> 01:40:36.197 region:rollup2
LIKE BETTER TERM. INTO THE WITH

01:40:34.562 --> 01:40:37.932 region:rollup2
ASSETS TO BE ABLE TO.

01:40:36.197 --> 01:40:39.700 region:rollup2
PAGE JUDGMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS

01:40:37.932 --> 01:40:40.167 region:rollup2
I BUT THEN THOSE ENTITIES ARE

01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:41.502 region:rollup2
GOING TO HAVE TROUBLE

01:40:40.167 --> 01:40:43.905 region:rollup2
PROSPECTIVELY.

01:40:41.502 --> 01:40:45.673 region:rollup2
GETTING INSURANCE THEY NEED.

01:40:43.905 --> 01:40:46.607 region:rollup2
TO TO BE ABLE TO.

01:40:45.673 --> 01:40:48.309 region:rollup2
TO TO FUND THE SETTLEMENTS AND

01:40:46.607 --> 01:40:48.776 region:rollup2
JUDGMENTS.

01:40:48.309 --> 01:40:51.345 region:rollup2
SO.

01:40:48.776 --> 01:40:53.748 region:rollup2
A FEW THINGS ON THAT FIRST I

01:40:51.345 --> 01:40:54.649 region:rollup2
WANNA BE CLEAR THAT AN EMPLOYER

01:40:53.748 --> 01:40:56.450 region:rollup2
HAS TO AT LEAST HAVE BEEN

01:40:54.649 --> 01:40:57.885 region:rollup2
NEGLIGENT RIGHT AND WHAT AND ONE

01:40:56.450 --> 01:40:59.487 region:rollup2
OF THE STRUGGLES.

01:40:57.885 --> 01:41:00.488 region:rollup2
AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN PAST

01:40:59.487 --> 01:41:02.056 region:rollup2

01:41:00.488 --> 01:41:03.624 region:rollup2
EVEN CONSTRUCTIVE KNOWLEDGE AS

01:41:02.056 --> 01:41:05.626 region:rollup2
HARD TO RECREATE RIGHT BUT

01:41:03.624 --> 01:41:08.062 region:rollup2
NEGLIGENCE ADAM.

01:41:05.626 --> 01:41:08.696 region:rollup2
I THINK IS THAT IT'S A AS. A

01:41:08.062 --> 01:41:10.765 region:rollup2
STANDARD THAT.

01:41:08.696 --> 01:41:13.534 region:rollup2
.

01:41:10.765 --> 01:41:16.470 region:rollup2
IT'S FAIR IN THIS SITUATION.

01:41:13.534 --> 01:41:16.871 region:rollup2
I HAVE A ARE YOU COMMITTED TO A

01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:19.140 region:rollup2

01:41:23.945 --> 01:41:27.214 region:rollup2
MATURITY

01:41:25.713 --> 01:41:28.816 region:rollup2
SO THAT IT WON'T BE OPEN ENDED

01:41:27.214 --> 01:41:29.917 region:rollup2
AND WERE WILLING TO MAKE THOSE

01:41:28.816 --> 01:41:31.152 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS NEXT COMMITTEE I

01:41:29.917 --> 01:41:32.286 region:rollup2
DON'T WANNA CONFUSE IT TOO MUCH

01:41:31.152 --> 01:41:33.988 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE BILL WAS ANALYZED

01:41:32.286 --> 01:41:37.525 region:rollup2

HOW?

01:41:47.935 --> 01:41:52.239 region:rollup2

THOSE WILL BE ADDRESSED?

01:41:56.510 --> 01:41:58.245 region:rollup2
AT BUT I THINK IT'S STILL

01:41:57.912 --> 01:41:59.814 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO.

01:41:58.245 --> 01:42:01.615 region:rollup2
.

01:41:59.814 --> 01:42:02.984 region:rollup2

SUPPORT FOR THESE VICTIMS IN

01:42:07.955 --> 01:42:11.025 region:rollup2

HAVE SEEN ON MY. POTENTIAL

01:42:13.894 --> 01:42:17.031 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS WHICH I I CAN STATE

01:42:15.963 --> 01:42:17.932 region:rollup2
BUT I DON'T WANT TO CONFUSE THE

01:42:17.031 --> 01:42:19.533 region:rollup2
SITUATION SINCE WE'RE NOT

01:42:17.932 --> 01:42:20.134 region:rollup2
HEARING THOSE AMENDMENTS TODAY I

01:42:19.533 --> 01:42:22.236 region:rollup2
I'D BE TAKING THEM ON MY OWN

01:42:20.134 --> 01:42:23.904 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE. AND THAT'S TO ADAM

01:42:22.236 --> 01:42:24.872 region:rollup2
OPEN UP THE LOOK BACK PERIOD FOR

01:42:23.904 --> 01:42:27.541 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS.

01:42:24.872 --> 01:42:29.110 region:rollup2
SO THE BERT BELL HAD A YEAR.

01:42:27.541 --> 01:42:30.311 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:42:29.110 --> 01:42:31.612 region:rollup2
MISSED OUT ON THAT FOR VARIETY

01:42:30.311 --> 01:42:33.648 region:rollup2
OF REASONS AND.

01:42:31.612 --> 01:42:34.415 region:rollup2
IF THAT'S WHAT AT GET REOPEN IT

01:42:33.648 --> 01:42:36.083 region:rollup2
FOR THREE YEARS.

01:42:34.415 --> 01:42:37.385 region:rollup2
ON THE LOOK BACK PERIOD AND

01:42:36.083 --> 01:42:39.620 region:rollup2
WOULD PROVIDE OUT WHAT EXTEND

01:42:37.385 --> 01:42:40.921 region:rollup2
WHAT IT IS NOW EIGHT TWENTY SIX

01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:42.223 region:rollup2
THE YET TO BE TWENTY SIX YEARS

01:42:40.921 --> 01:42:43.557 region:rollup2
OLD THAT WOULD EXTEND AT FORTY

01:42:42.223 --> 01:42:45.760 region:rollup2
WHICH SEEMS REASONABLE BECAUSE

01:42:43.557 --> 01:42:46.694 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE. IN.

01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:48.562 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL LAW.

01:42:46.694 --> 01:42:50.364 region:rollup2
SO INSTEAD OF TWENTY SIX AND

01:42:48.562 --> 01:42:52.066 region:rollup2
THOSE OF US WHO AROUND THAT KIND

01:42:50.364 --> 01:42:53.668 region:rollup2
OF TWENTY YEAR OLDS I KNOW THAT.

01:42:52.066 --> 01:42:55.236 region:rollup2
COMING TO TERMS WITH

01:42:53.668 --> 01:42:56.637 region:rollup2
TRAUMA IN YOUR EARLY CHILDHOOD

IN YOUR MID TWENTIES DOESN'T

01:42:56.637 --> 01:42:59.974 region:rollup2
SEEM LIKE YOUR.

01:42:57.438 --> 01:43:01.842 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY AT THAT POINT FORTY

01:42:59.974 --> 01:43:02.777 region:rollup2
I THINK EXTENDS AT.

01:43:01.842 --> 01:43:04.512 region:rollup2
TO A POINT WHERE PEOPLE HAVE

01:43:02.777 --> 01:43:07.048 region:rollup2
GROWN UP.

01:43:04.512 --> 01:43:07.248 region:rollup2
AND EXTENDS THE THE PERIOD BY

01:43:07.048 --> 01:43:09.850 region:rollup2
WHICH

01:43:07.248 --> 01:43:11.619 region:rollup2
ONCE DISCOVERED.

01:43:09.850 --> 01:43:13.587 region:rollup2
IF IT'S AFTER FORTY EIGHT FROM

01:43:11.619 --> 01:43:14.922 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS TO FIVE BECAUSE WE

01:43:13.587 --> 01:43:16.290 region:rollup2
THOUGHT THREE YEARS WAS VERY.

01:43:14.922 --> 01:43:18.292 region:rollup2
LIMIT TINA WE TALKED A NUMBER

01:43:16.290 --> 01:43:18.659 region:rollup2
OF VICTIMS WHO IF YOU REALLY

01:43:18.292 --> 01:43:19.760 region:rollup2
THINK THRILLED.

01:43:18.659 --> 01:43:21.162 region:rollup2
.

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:22.430 region:rollup2
THE WHAT THE PSYCHIATRISTS AND

01:43:21.162 --> 01:43:24.298 region:rollup2
REALIZING WHAT HAPPENED THE

01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:25.633 region:rollup2
DAMAGE THAT IT'S DONE AND MAYBE

01:43:24.298 --> 01:43:26.967 region:rollup2
YOUR. YOUR MARRIAGE IS FALLING

01:43:25.633 --> 01:43:28.335 region:rollup2
APART OVER AT OUR.

01:43:26.967 --> 01:43:29.537 region:rollup2

YOUR KIDS OR WHATEVER IS

01:43:29.537 --> 01:43:32.206 region:rollup2
HAPPENING YOU STILL HAVE TO COME

01:43:30.771 --> 01:43:32.873 region:rollup2
TO TERMS WITH TELLING YOUR

01:43:32.206 --> 01:43:34.408 region:rollup2

01:43:32.873 --> 01:43:36.010 region:rollup2
IN THAT INSTANCE OF THE CHURCH

01:43:34.408 --> 01:43:37.745 region:rollup2
TELLING YOUR COMMUNITY YOUR

01:43:36.010 --> 01:43:39.847 region:rollup2

DECISION TO FILE A LAWSUIT AND

01:43:39.847 --> 01:43:42.383 region:rollup2
I'M THREE YEARS ALTHOUGH IT

01:43:40.781 --> 01:43:43.984 region:rollup2
SEEMS LIKE A LONG PERIOD TIME IT

01:43:42.383 --> 01:43:45.586 region:rollup2
IS NOT AYE I THINK IS.

01:43:43.984 --> 01:43:46.320 region:rollup2
.

01:43:45.586 --> 01:43:46.921 region:rollup2
PROBABLY NOT THAT LONG FOR

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:49.123 region:rollup2
VICTIM WHO'S DEALING WITH ALL

01:43:46.921 --> 01:43:51.425 region:rollup2

NUMBER OF CASES FOR PRIVATE

01:45:05.266 --> 01:45:08.969 region:rollup2
ENTITIES THIS WOULD BE THE THIRD

01:45:06.267 --> 01:45:10.437 region:rollup2
TIME AND SO COMPANIES THAT

01:45:08.969 --> 01:45:12.273 region:rollup2

DURING THE BURDEN BILL WOULD BE

01:45:15.142 --> 01:45:18.913 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFICULT NOW TO LOOK AT

AS SALARY EXEMPT WORKERS.

01:50:58.785 --> 01:51:00.988 region:rollup2
I HOPE THAT WE WOULD HAVE HAD A

01:50:59.586 --> 01:51:01.688 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVE CHANCE TO FIGHT FOR

01:51:00.988 --> 01:51:03.190 region:rollup2

BECAUSE THEIR PATH IS THEIR PATH

PROPOSITION AND THE NATURE OF

THIS BILL WHICH I THINK IT'S

01:53:05.679 --> 01:53:08.415 region:rollup2
BEEN VERY MISS CHARACTERIZE

01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:10.450 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL IT DOES NOT APPLY.

01:53:08.415 --> 01:53:11.685 region:rollup2
TO ALL CLAIMS.

01:53:10.450 --> 01:53:13.387 region:rollup2
AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT IT

01:53:11.685 --> 01:53:14.554 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT APPLY TO FRAUD CLAIMS

01:53:13.387 --> 01:53:15.956 region:rollup2
OR CONTRACT CLAIMS OR TORT

01:53:14.554 --> 01:53:17.357 region:rollup2
CLAIMS.

01:53:15.956 --> 01:53:19.192 region:rollup2
OR WRONGFUL TERMINATION CLAIMS

OR JUST BECAUSE CLAIMS WERE

TALKING ABOUT IT APPLY TO.

01:53:20.894 --> 01:53:25.565 region:rollup2
PUBLIC LAW CLAIMS YOUR LAWS

01:53:23.530 --> 01:53:26.099 region:rollup2
THE LAWS THAT YOU PASS.

01:53:25.565 --> 01:53:27.968 region:rollup2
BUT THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:53:26.099 --> 01:53:29.436 region:rollup2
ENFORCE.

01:53:27.968 --> 01:53:31.104 region:rollup2
THE ONE PHRASE AT THE U. S.

01:53:29.436 --> 01:53:32.806 region:rollup2
SUPREME COURT REPEATS OVER AND

01:53:31.104 --> 01:53:35.475 region:rollup2
OVER HIS ARBITRATION IS A MATTER

01:53:32.806 --> 01:53:36.610 region:rollup2
OF CONSENT. AND NOT COERCION.

01:53:35.475 --> 01:53:38.045 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT

01:53:36.610 --> 01:53:38.545 region:rollup2
I'VE ARGUED SEVEN CASES

01:53:38.045 --> 01:53:40.480 region:rollup2
ARBITRATION CASE TO THE

01:53:38.545 --> 01:53:42.449 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SUPREME.

01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:43.884 region:rollup2
BASED TO SAY ARBITRATE THE

01:53:42.449 --> 01:53:46.286 region:rollup2
BEDROCK JUSTIFICATION FOR

01:53:43.884 --> 01:53:47.954 region:rollup2
ARBITRATIONS VOLUNTARINESS.

01:53:46.286 --> 01:53:50.424 region:rollup2
THE REASON THAT THIS BILL THIS

01:53:47.954 --> 01:53:52.559 region:rollup2
NARROW BILL IS NOT PREEMPTED.

01:53:50.424 --> 01:53:54.861 region:rollup2
IT IS IT IS VERY SIMPLE

01:53:52.559 --> 01:53:55.796 region:rollup2
IT DOES NOT INVALIDATE.

01:53:54.861 --> 01:53:56.396 region:rollup2
FLORA VOID ANY ARBITRATION

01:53:55.796 --> 01:53:58.999 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT

01:53:56.396 --> 01:54:00.734 region:rollup2
PERIOD.

01:53:58.999 --> 01:54:02.969 region:rollup2
IT DOES NOT PROHIBIT ARBITRATION

01:54:00.734 --> 01:54:03.437 region:rollup2
OF ANY KIND OF CASE.

01:54:02.969 --> 01:54:04.271 region:rollup2
IT PERMITS PRE DISPUTE

01:54:03.437 --> 01:54:05.806 region:rollup2
AGREEMENTS

01:54:04.271 --> 01:54:07.140 region:rollup2
IT PERMITS

01:54:05.806 --> 01:54:08.875 region:rollup2
POSTED SPEWED AGREEMENTS.

01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:10.410 region:rollup2
A

01:54:08.875 --> 01:54:12.412 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S NEVER BEEN.

01:54:10.410 --> 01:54:14.014 region:rollup2
TO MY KNOWLEDGE.

01:54:12.412 --> 01:54:15.515 region:rollup2
IN ARBITRATION DECISION FROM THE

01:54:14.014 --> 01:54:17.351 region:rollup2
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.

01:54:15.515 --> 01:54:18.351 region:rollup2
THAT APPLIED IN A SITUATION

01:54:17.351 --> 01:54:19.286 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE WAS NO ARBITRATION

01:54:18.351 --> 01:54:21.254 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT EVERY SINGLE

01:54:19.286 --> 01:54:22.622 region:rollup2
PREEMPTION CASE.

01:54:21.254 --> 01:54:24.124 region:rollup2
COMES UP IN THE CONTEXT OF

01:54:22.622 --> 01:54:24.758 region:rollup2
SOMEONE SIGNED THAT AGREEMENT

01:54:24.124 --> 01:54:26.393 region:rollup2
AND THE COURTS SAYING SHOULD BE

01:54:24.758 --> 01:54:27.327 region:rollup2
HALTED TO IT.

01:54:26.393 --> 01:54:29.596 region:rollup2
SO THERE IS NO PREEMPTION ISSUE

01:54:27.327 --> 01:54:31.331 region:rollup2
HERE BECAUSE OUR FOCUS IS TO

01:54:29.596 --> 01:54:33.133 region:rollup2
JUST SIMPLY INSURE THAT THE

01:54:31.331 --> 01:54:36.036 region:rollup2
CREATION OF THE CONTRACT HAS

01:54:33.133 --> 01:54:37.504 region:rollup2
SOME MINIMAL. LEVEL OF

01:54:36.036 --> 01:54:39.406 region:rollup2
VOLUNTARINESS WERE CONSENT.

01:54:37.504 --> 01:54:41.108 region:rollup2
THE.

01:54:39.406 --> 01:54:43.844 region:rollup2
ANOTHER IMPORTANT FACTOR IS THAT

01:54:41.108 --> 01:54:46.079 region:rollup2
UNLIKE IN THE CONSUMER CONTEXT.

01:54:43.844 --> 01:54:47.814 region:rollup2
THE FAA DOES NOT.

01:54:46.079 --> 01:54:49.382 region:rollup2
PREEMPT OR EVEN APPLY TO ALL

01:54:47.814 --> 01:54:51.284 region:rollup2

01:54:51.284 --> 01:54:55.122 region:rollup2
IN THE CASE THAT WE WERE UPON A

01:54:52.953 --> 01:54:56.823 region:rollup2

01:55:01.395 --> 01:55:04.998 region:rollup2
MARITIME INDUSTRY WORKING ON

01:55:03.063 --> 01:55:06.700 region:rollup2
RAILROADS SO CALIFORNIA HAS A

01:55:04.998 --> 01:55:07.667 region:rollup2
VERY STRONG INTEREST IN SETTING

01:55:06.700 --> 01:55:09.369 region:rollup2
ITS OWN LAWS AND ITS OWN

01:55:07.667 --> 01:55:10.937 region:rollup2
POLICIES.

01:55:09.369 --> 01:55:12.672 region:rollup2
IN AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO

01:55:10.937 --> 01:55:15.442 region:rollup2
DO THAT.

01:55:12.672 --> 01:55:16.610 region:rollup2
IN NY ANALYSIS AT YOUR STAFF DO

01:55:15.442 --> 01:55:17.944 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD ANALYSIS YOUR STAFF

01:55:16.610 --> 01:55:19.646 region:rollup2
PROVIDED THEY TALKED ABOUT THE

01:55:17.944 --> 01:55:20.113 region:rollup2
RIGHTS AND REMEDIES THAT ARE

01:55:19.646 --> 01:55:20.580 region:rollup2

01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:23.850 region:rollup2
WHICH IS AN EXTRAORDINARY.

01:55:28.755 --> 01:55:32.526 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW IF YOU EMPLOYER

YOU AND I KNOW.

01:59:41.041 --> 01:59:43.710 region:rollup2

SUGGESTED THIS IN LAST COMMITTEE

01:59:43.710 --> 01:59:46.279 region:rollup2
WILL OF ARBITRATION IS SO GREAT

THIS BILL WILL PREVENT THAT FROM

01:59:48.648 --> 01:59:50.850 region:rollup2
HAPPENING. THAT EMPLOYERS AND

01:59:49.983 --> 01:59:52.118 region:rollup2

01:59:50.850 --> 01:59:52.986 region:rollup2
ARBITRATION REGARDLESS OF

01:59:52.118 --> 01:59:54.487 region:rollup2
WHETHER NOTS A CONDITION OF A

01:59:52.986 --> 01:59:55.522 region:rollup2
CONTRACTOR NOT BUT ECHOES THE

01:59:54.487 --> 01:59:56.890 region:rollup2
VERY HEART OF WHY EMPLOYERS

01:59:55.522 --> 01:59:58.491 region:rollup2
UTILIZE ARBITRATION. EMPLOYERS

01:59:56.890 --> 01:59:59.292 region:rollup2
UTILIZE ARBITRATION NOT BECAUSE

01:59:58.491 --> 02:00:00.460 region:rollup2
THEY THINK THEY'RE GONNA GET

01:59:59.292 --> 02:00:01.628 region:rollup2
SOME ADVANTAGE AGAINST THE

EMPLOYEES IN ARBITRATION THAT

02:00:01.628 --> 02:00:03.763 region:rollup2
THAT THEY THINK THEY'RE GOING TO

02:00:02.295 --> 02:00:04.831 region:rollup2
REDUCE THE AWARDS TO THE

02:00:03.763 --> 02:00:07.100 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES IN ARBITRATION THEY'D

02:00:04.831 --> 02:00:08.401 region:rollup2
UTILIZE ARBITRATION. AS UNIFORM

02:00:07.100 --> 02:00:09.703 region:rollup2
WAY IN WHICH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES

02:00:08.401 --> 02:00:11.004 region:rollup2
TO AVOID LITIGATION COSTS AND

02:00:09.703 --> 02:00:12.872 region:rollup2
ATTORNEYS FEES THEY WOULD RATHER

02:00:11.004 --> 02:00:14.207 region:rollup2
HAVE THE ROSE DISPUTE RESOLVED

02:00:12.872 --> 02:00:15.341 region:rollup2
WITHIN A YEAR THING GOING

02:00:14.207 --> 02:00:16.509 region:rollup2
LITIGATED FOR FIVE TO SEVEN

02:00:15.341 --> 02:00:17.644 region:rollup2

02:00:16.509 --> 02:00:18.712 region:rollup2
HAVE TO PAY NOT ONLY THEIR

02:00:17.644 --> 02:00:19.779 region:rollup2
DEFENSE COSTS AND THEIR

02:00:18.712 --> 02:00:20.747 region:rollup2
ATTORNEYS FEES. BUT THE

02:00:19.779 --> 02:00:22.916 region:rollup2
ATTORNEYS FEES AT THAT POINT AS

02:00:20.747 --> 02:00:23.717 region:rollup2
WELL AND SO WHEN YOU LACK THAT

02:00:22.916 --> 02:00:24.818 region:rollup2
UNIFORMITY THAN YOU OUT YOU

02:00:23.717 --> 02:00:26.419 region:rollup2
CAN'T MITIGATE THAT RISK WITH

02:00:24.818 --> 02:00:27.754 region:rollup2
REGARDS TO ATTORNEYS FEES. AS

02:00:26.419 --> 02:00:29.055 region:rollup2
LONG AS WE HAVE THE UNDERLYING

02:00:27.754 --> 02:00:30.390 region:rollup2
ISSUE WITH REGARD TO LITIGATION

02:00:29.055 --> 02:00:32.125 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT HERE IN CALIFORNIA

02:00:30.390 --> 02:00:33.560 region:rollup2
WHERE EMPLOYERS CAN BE SUED FOR

02:00:32.125 --> 02:00:34.694 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS ON THE

02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:35.929 region:rollup2
PAYSTUB THAT THE RESULTING IN

02:00:34.694 --> 02:00:37.630 region:rollup2
THE WAGE FLOPS. YOU WILL SEE

02:00:35.929 --> 02:00:38.798 region:rollup2
COMPANIES UTILIZE ARBITRATION AS

02:00:37.630 --> 02:00:39.966 region:rollup2
A WAY TO AVOID THE ATTORNEY'S

02:00:38.798 --> 02:00:41.034 region:rollup2
FEES THAT CAN BASICALLY BANKRUPT

02:00:39.966 --> 02:00:42.268 region:rollup2
THEM AND PUT THEM OUT OF

02:00:41.034 --> 02:00:43.736 region:rollup2
BUSINESS SO THAT IS WHY WE

02:00:42.268 --> 02:00:45.105 region:rollup2
UTILIZE THE ARBITRATION AS A

02:00:43.736 --> 02:00:46.473 region:rollup2
CONDITION OF CONTRACT. THE OTHER

02:00:45.105 --> 02:00:48.274 region:rollup2
POINT I WANTED TO MAKE WAS WITH

02:00:46.473 --> 02:00:50.944 region:rollup2
REGARDS THE PREEMPTION ISSUE.

02:00:48.274 --> 02:00:51.411 region:rollup2

02:00:50.944 --> 02:00:52.612 region:rollup2
KIND OF SURPRISING THE

02:00:51.411 --> 02:00:54.080 region:rollup2
PROPONENTS COMMENTS THAT SAY

02:00:52.612 --> 02:00:55.248 region:rollup2
THAT THE MANDATORY USE OF

02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:56.149 region:rollup2
ARBITRATION HAS NEVER BEEN

02:00:55.248 --> 02:00:57.450 region:rollup2

02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:17.036 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR AND THE CANDOR NURSING

02:01:14.934 --> 02:01:18.505 region:rollup2
CASES I WAS DEALING WITH REGARDS

02:01:17.036 --> 02:01:19.739 region:rollup2
TO THE CONTRACTUAL FORMATION AND

02:01:18.505 --> 02:01:20.940 region:rollup2
THE WHOLE IDEA THAT IF WE.

02:01:19.739 --> 02:01:22.408 region:rollup2
THAT FEDERAL ARBITRATION

02:01:20.940 --> 02:01:23.910 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT SOMEHOW IGNORED THE

02:01:22.408 --> 02:01:25.512 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF CONTRACTUAL FORMATION.

02:01:23.910 --> 02:01:26.579 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'VE BASICALLY BEEN

02:01:25.512 --> 02:01:27.580 region:rollup2
UNDERMINING THE WHOLE POINT OF

CONCERNED WITH PUBLIC A CONTRACT

02:01:29.415 --> 02:01:32.085 region:rollup2
IS FORM SO I DISAGREE WITH THE

02:01:30.583 --> 02:01:33.419 region:rollup2
FACT. THAT THE ARBITRATION OF

02:01:32.085 --> 02:01:34.220 region:rollup2
FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT DOESN'T

02:01:33.419 --> 02:01:35.655 region:rollup2
ADDRESS MENTAL THE CONTRACT IS

02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:36.990 region:rollup2
FORMED IN WITH REGARDS THE

02:01:35.655 --> 02:01:38.424 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS ON.

02:01:36.990 --> 02:01:40.527 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS SOMEHOW UNDER THE

02:01:38.424 --> 02:01:42.095 region:rollup2
SAVINGS CLAUSE OF THE CONTRACT A

02:01:40.527 --> 02:01:43.863 region:rollup2
OF THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT

02:01:42.095 --> 02:01:45.265 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT IT'S ONLY APPLICABLE TO

ONE PROVISION IN EMPLOYMENT

02:01:45.265 --> 02:01:48.601 region:rollup2
CONTRACT AND THAT'S ARBITRATION.

02:01:46.733 --> 02:01:50.203 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS TO REQUIRE OTHER

02:01:48.601 --> 02:01:51.237 region:rollup2

02:01:59.345 --> 02:02:01.014 region:rollup2
THE CONTRACT THAT IS WHAT THE

02:02:00.513 --> 02:02:02.448 region:rollup2
ESSENCE OF THE FEDERAL

02:02:01.014 --> 02:02:03.650 region:rollup2

YOU CAN'T HAVE IT AS A CONDITION

02:02:20.233 --> 02:02:22.669 region:rollup2

FORWARD A IMPORTANT ISSUE AN

02:02:46.125 --> 02:02:48.328 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PROBLEM THAT WE'RE ALL

02:02:47.393 --> 02:02:49.762 region:rollup2
AWARE OF.

02:02:48.328 --> 02:02:52.498 region:rollup2
THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS

02:02:49.762 --> 02:02:53.499 region:rollup2
ATTENTION FOCUSED ON SOLUTIONS.

02:02:52.498 --> 02:02:55.401 region:rollup2
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

02:02:53.499 --> 02:02:57.237 region:rollup2
EVERY PROPOSED SOLUTION IS THE

02:02:55.401 --> 02:02:58.438 region:rollup2
BEST WAY UP FOR CALIFORNIA TO

02:02:57.237 --> 02:03:00.240 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD.

02:02:58.438 --> 02:03:00.873 region:rollup2
WE ARE CONCERNED THAT AS

02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:03.076 region:rollup2
WRITTEN.

02:03:00.873 --> 02:03:04.410 region:rollup2
THAT AB THIRTY EIGHTY CREATES

02:03:03.076 --> 02:03:06.079 region:rollup2
AN UNTENABLE DYNAMIC.

02:03:04.410 --> 02:03:07.947 region:rollup2
THAT UNDERCUTS THE ABILITY TO

02:03:06.079 --> 02:03:10.049 region:rollup2
SETTLE CASES AND IN SOME CASES

02:03:07.947 --> 02:03:12.018 region:rollup2
MAY PROHIBIT THAT ABILITY. ARM

02:03:10.049 --> 02:03:13.419 region:rollup2
AND IT PROHIBITS A NONDISCLOSURE

02:03:12.018 --> 02:03:15.555 region:rollup2
AGREEMENTS EVEN WHEN BOTH

02:03:13.419 --> 02:03:16.990 region:rollup2
PARTIES THAT DESIRE THEM BEFORE

02:03:15.555 --> 02:03:17.557 region:rollup2
I GET INTO THE DETAILS ON THAT.

02:03:16.990 --> 02:03:19.959 region:rollup2
I DO WANT TO DETANGLE JUST A

02:03:17.557 --> 02:03:22.028 region:rollup2
BIT.

02:03:19.959 --> 02:03:23.696 region:rollup2
THE ARBITRATION VERSES

02:03:22.028 --> 02:03:25.698 region:rollup2
CONFIDENTIALITY ISSUE.

02:03:23.696 --> 02:03:27.667 region:rollup2
THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE ISSUES

02:03:25.698 --> 02:03:29.669 region:rollup2
OUR* A CONFIDENTIALITY IS

02:03:27.667 --> 02:03:31.104 region:rollup2
NOT SOMETHING THAT IS A SPECIFIC

02:03:29.669 --> 02:03:33.640 region:rollup2
TO ARBITRATION.

02:03:31.104 --> 02:03:35.742 region:rollup2
A CONCERN AS THE FORMER.

02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:38.444 region:rollup2
WITNESS TESTIFIED ARBITRATION

02:03:35.742 --> 02:03:40.480 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IS MORE THE TRANSPARENT

02:03:38.444 --> 02:03:42.282 region:rollup2
ON YOU CAN HAVE A NONDISCLOSURE

02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:44.150 region:rollup2
AGREEMENTS IN BOTH LITIGATION

02:03:42.282 --> 02:03:45.518 region:rollup2
AND ARBITRATION AND SO.

02:03:44.150 --> 02:03:47.453 region:rollup2
ARBITRATION THE OUR ARBITRATION

02:03:45.518 --> 02:03:49.923 region:rollup2
ISSUE SHOULD STAND ON ITS OWN

02:03:47.453 --> 02:03:51.090 region:rollup2
FROM THE CONFIDENTIALITY ISSUE.

02:03:49.923 --> 02:03:52.759 region:rollup2
ON THE VAST MAJORITY OF.

02:03:51.090 --> 02:03:54.193 region:rollup2

02:04:02.602 --> 02:04:05.772 region:rollup2
RESOLUTION.

02:04:03.536 --> 02:04:08.141 region:rollup2
THAT BENEFITS BOTH PARTIES AND

02:04:05.772 --> 02:04:10.376 region:rollup2
SAVES PRECIOUS PUBLIC RESOURCES

02:04:08.141 --> 02:04:12.078 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU LOOK AT SECTION FOR

02:04:10.376 --> 02:04:14.547 region:rollup2

02:04:46.479 --> 02:04:49.749 region:rollup2
PROBLEM AS WELL CALIFORNIA FOR

EMPLOYMENT HOUSING CLAIMS ARE

02:04:49.749 --> 02:04:52.418 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE MOST SENSITIVE

02:04:50.650 --> 02:04:53.986 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT ARE LITIGATED TODAY.

02:04:52.418 --> 02:04:56.155 region:rollup2

CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT. SO FOR

02:05:07.367 --> 02:05:10.770 region:rollup2
THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY

02:05:08.701 --> 02:05:11.304 region:rollup2
ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON A. B.

02:05:10.770 --> 02:05:12.105 region:rollup2

02:05:12.105 --> 02:05:17.677 region:rollup2
ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION.

02:05:16.309 --> 02:05:20.646 region:rollup2
SEEING NONE OF RING BACK TO THE

02:05:17.677 --> 02:05:21.714 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS.

02:05:20.646 --> 02:05:22.882 region:rollup2
IT'S CUNNINGHAM PERCENT THANK

02:05:21.714 --> 02:05:24.951 region:rollup2
YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST HAVE A

02:05:22.882 --> 02:05:26.819 region:rollup2
COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS.

02:05:24.951 --> 02:05:27.920 region:rollup2
IT SOUNDS LIKE ON THE FEDERAL

02:05:26.819 --> 02:05:29.155 region:rollup2
PREEMPTION ISSUE THAT THERE'S

02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:30.890 region:rollup2
JUST A DISPUTE.

02:05:29.155 --> 02:05:32.225 region:rollup2
I AND I DID.

02:05:30.890 --> 02:05:33.526 region:rollup2
I'M TRYING TO WRAP MY HEAD

02:05:32.225 --> 02:05:34.193 region:rollup2
AROUND THAT AND.

02:05:33.526 --> 02:05:37.063 region:rollup2
.

02:05:34.193 --> 02:05:38.765 region:rollup2
WHAT?

02:05:37.063 --> 02:05:41.300 region:rollup2
WHY AGAIN WOULD THIS NOT BE

02:05:38.765 --> 02:05:42.769 region:rollup2
PREEMPTED BY THE FAA SO I I CAN

02:05:41.300 --> 02:05:44.270 region:rollup2
DEFERRED TO THE EXPERT BUT AT

02:05:42.769 --> 02:05:45.872 region:rollup2
THIS AYE I JUST WANT?

02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:47.173 region:rollup2
TO BE CLEAR WE WE FEEL LIKE

02:05:45.872 --> 02:05:48.708 region:rollup2
GIVEN.

02:05:47.173 --> 02:05:50.109 region:rollup2
PASS LAWS AND WHAT'S HAPPENED

02:05:48.708 --> 02:05:51.544 region:rollup2
THAT WEEK NARROWLY TAILORED THIS

02:05:50.109 --> 02:05:53.112 region:rollup2
IN A WAY THAT WE'RE NOT

02:05:51.544 --> 02:05:55.214 region:rollup2
INVALIDATING AN ACTUAL

02:05:53.112 --> 02:05:56.282 region:rollup2
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT I THINK IN

02:05:55.214 --> 02:05:57.750 region:rollup2
ALL OF THOSE CASES AND ACTUALLY.

02:05:56.282 --> 02:05:59.419 region:rollup2
.

02:05:57.750 --> 02:06:00.787 region:rollup2
THE EXPERT ARGUED MANY OF THOSE

02:05:59.419 --> 02:06:03.723 region:rollup2
CASES SO I LET HIM.

02:06:00.787 --> 02:06:05.224 region:rollup2
CLARIFY BUT IN THOSE CASES AS

02:06:03.723 --> 02:06:06.392 region:rollup2
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED

02:06:05.224 --> 02:06:07.326 region:rollup2
AND IT WAS TRYING TO BE

02:06:06.392 --> 02:06:09.262 region:rollup2
INVALIDATED THAT'S DIFFERENT

02:06:07.326 --> 02:06:11.364 region:rollup2
FROM SUGGESTING THAT THERE CAN

02:06:09.262 --> 02:06:12.932 region:rollup2
BE NO. NOT JUST ARBITRATION

02:06:11.364 --> 02:06:14.934 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT BUT ANY WAIVER OF A

02:06:12.932 --> 02:06:16.402 region:rollup2
PROTECTED RIGHTS.

02:06:14.934 --> 02:06:18.871 region:rollup2
THAT THE SPECIFIC ANSWER THE

02:06:16.402 --> 02:06:20.473 region:rollup2
FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT SAYS.

02:06:18.871 --> 02:06:22.875 region:rollup2
AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL

02:06:20.473 --> 02:06:23.409 region:rollup2
BE ENFORCED SO IT REQUIRES

02:06:22.875 --> 02:06:24.577 region:rollup2
THERE'D BE AN AGREEMENT TO

02:06:23.409 --> 02:06:26.345 region:rollup2
ARBITRATE.

02:06:24.577 --> 02:06:28.314 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS

02:06:26.345 --> 02:06:29.682 region:rollup2
PREEMPTED IN IN. OUR

02:06:28.314 --> 02:06:32.118 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY WOMAN'S WEBBER'S GOOD

02:06:29.682 --> 02:06:34.020 region:rollup2
BILL WAS IT ATTEMPTED TO AVOID

02:06:32.118 --> 02:06:35.288 region:rollup2
AN AGREEMENT THAT WAS SIGNED.

02:06:34.020 --> 02:06:37.590 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE THAT ARE BUILT WE

02:06:35.288 --> 02:06:39.725 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY DID NOT TRY TO

02:06:37.590 --> 02:06:40.860 region:rollup2
NEGATE OR AVOID ANY ARBITRATION

02:06:39.725 --> 02:06:43.029 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT IT SIGNED WHICH IS

02:06:40.860 --> 02:06:44.797 region:rollup2
REALLY WHERE THE FAA APPLIES.

02:06:43.029 --> 02:06:46.833 region:rollup2
ALSO.

02:06:44.797 --> 02:06:48.468 region:rollup2
THE FAA.

02:06:46.833 --> 02:06:50.069 region:rollup2
HAS TO HAVE SOME DEGREE OF

02:06:48.468 --> 02:06:51.370 region:rollup2
CONSENT

02:06:50.069 --> 02:06:52.271 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO THE SUPREME COURT

02:06:51.370 --> 02:06:54.140 region:rollup2
WERE TALKING ABOUT THE WAIVER OF

02:06:52.271 --> 02:06:54.874 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.

02:06:54.140 --> 02:06:56.943 region:rollup2
THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO

02:06:54.874 --> 02:06:57.510 region:rollup2
PETITION FIFTY MEMORIZED TO

02:06:56.943 --> 02:06:58.911 region:rollup2
PROCESS A SEVENTH AMENDMENT

02:06:57.510 --> 02:07:01.314 region:rollup2
RIGHT OF.

02:06:58.911 --> 02:07:03.149 region:rollup2
THE JURY TRIAL SO THERE HAS TO

02:07:01.314 --> 02:07:05.318 region:rollup2
BE SOME DEGREE OF CONSENT.

02:07:03.149 --> 02:07:07.386 region:rollup2
A AND AND THIS BILL DOES NOT

02:07:05.318 --> 02:07:08.988 region:rollup2
PROHIBIT ARBITRATION THIS IS NOT

02:07:07.386 --> 02:07:11.657 region:rollup2
AN ANTI ARBITRATION BILL.

02:07:08.988 --> 02:07:13.192 region:rollup2
A AND GOING FURTHER.

02:07:11.657 --> 02:07:14.994 region:rollup2
THE FAA DOESN'T APPLY TO ALL

02:07:13.192 --> 02:07:16.395 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT.

02:07:14.994 --> 02:07:17.763 region:rollup2
THERE'S THERE'S AT NUMBERS OF

02:07:16.395 --> 02:07:19.966 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES OF WORKERS WHO ARE

02:07:17.763 --> 02:07:21.300 region:rollup2
EVEN COVERED BY THE FAA THERE

02:07:19.966 --> 02:07:22.268 region:rollup2
WAS JUST A CASE TWO MONTHS AGO.

02:07:21.300 --> 02:07:23.469 region:rollup2
I INVOLVING A CLASS ACTION

02:07:22.268 --> 02:07:24.937 region:rollup2
PROHIBITION

02:07:23.469 --> 02:07:27.607 region:rollup2
WHERE THE UNITED STATES SUPREME

02:07:24.937 --> 02:07:29.008 region:rollup2
COURT UPHELD CLASS PROHIBITIONS

02:07:27.607 --> 02:07:29.876 region:rollup2
FOR AWHILE BUT WE WERE IN. THE

02:07:29.008 --> 02:07:30.943 region:rollup2
PLAINTIFFS WERE ALLOWED TO GO

02:07:29.876 --> 02:07:32.745 region:rollup2
FORWARD BECAUSE THEY WERE IN THE

02:07:30.943 --> 02:07:34.580 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS.

02:07:32.745 --> 02:07:36.115 region:rollup2
SO THE FAA ONLY HAS LIMITED

02:07:34.580 --> 02:07:38.484 region:rollup2
APPLICATION IN THE WORKPLACE BUT

02:07:36.115 --> 02:07:39.051 region:rollup2
IT HAS NEVER BEEN APPLIED.

02:07:38.484 --> 02:07:40.253 region:rollup2
IN A CASE WHERE THERE WAS NO

02:07:39.051 --> 02:07:42.121 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT.

02:07:40.253 --> 02:07:43.289 region:rollup2
I THAT THE OPPONENTS HERE

02:07:42.121 --> 02:07:44.924 region:rollup2
MENTIONED THE ARMAND DAR'S CASE

02:07:43.289 --> 02:07:46.692 region:rollup2
I ARGUED THAT.

02:07:44.924 --> 02:07:47.560 region:rollup2
THE SONIC CALABASAS CASES I

02:07:46.692 --> 02:07:49.295 region:rollup2
ARGUED THAT TWICE TO THE

02:07:47.560 --> 02:07:50.329 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT BOTH OF

02:07:49.295 --> 02:07:51.731 region:rollup2
THOSE CASES HAD SIGNED

02:07:50.329 --> 02:07:53.166 region:rollup2
ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS AND THE

02:07:51.731 --> 02:07:54.767 region:rollup2
QUESTION WAS. ARE WE GOING TO

02:07:53.166 --> 02:07:57.537 region:rollup2
ENFORCE IT.

02:07:54.767 --> 02:07:58.671 region:rollup2
SO THERE IS NO CASE WHERE THE

02:07:57.537 --> 02:07:59.839 region:rollup2
FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT REACHES

02:07:58.671 --> 02:08:00.973 region:rollup2
DOWN TO A STATE AND SAID YOU

02:07:59.839 --> 02:08:02.275 region:rollup2
CAN'T REGULATE THE EMPLOYMENT

02:08:00.973 --> 02:08:03.342 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP.

02:08:02.275 --> 02:08:05.278 region:rollup2
YOU CAN'T REGULATE.

02:08:03.342 --> 02:08:07.346 region:rollup2
THE APPLICATION PROCESS IT'S

02:08:05.278 --> 02:08:09.015 region:rollup2
SIMPLY IS NEVER HAPPENED.

02:08:07.346 --> 02:08:11.150 region:rollup2
THIS STATEMENT THAT ARBITRATION

02:08:09.015 --> 02:08:12.818 region:rollup2
IS NOT SECRET IS SIMPLY FALSE I

02:08:11.150 --> 02:08:14.520 region:rollup2
WAS ALSO VERY INVOLVING THAT'S

02:08:12.818 --> 02:08:15.054 region:rollup2
GOING BEYOND.

02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:17.690 region:rollup2
OKAY WAS AS PART OF YOUR

02:08:15.054 --> 02:08:20.526 region:rollup2
QUESTION NO I THINK YOU COVERED

02:08:17.690 --> 02:08:21.961 region:rollup2
THAT THANK YOU YEAH.

02:08:20.526 --> 02:08:22.595 region:rollup2
THANK YOU'RE CLEARLY AN EXPERT

02:08:21.961 --> 02:08:23.829 region:rollup2
ON.

02:08:22.595 --> 02:08:25.298 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:08:23.829 --> 02:08:27.333 region:rollup2
I JUST SAID

02:08:25.298 --> 02:08:28.534 region:rollup2
TWO OTHER QUICK QUESTIONS.

02:08:27.333 --> 02:08:31.137 region:rollup2
I AM I AM A LITTLE CONCERNED I

02:08:28.534 --> 02:08:31.938 region:rollup2
GUESS ON.

02:08:31.137 --> 02:08:33.472 region:rollup2
ON THE EFFECT THIS MIGHT HAVE ON

02:08:31.938 --> 02:08:36.042 region:rollup2
ON.

02:08:33.472 --> 02:08:37.743 region:rollup2
FOLKS THAT.

02:08:36.042 --> 02:08:38.911 region:rollup2
COULD NOT NECESSARILY AFFORD AN

02:08:37.743 --> 02:08:40.513 region:rollup2
ATTORNEY GIVEN THAT LITIGATION

02:08:38.911 --> 02:08:42.648 region:rollup2
IN COURT.

02:08:40.513 --> 02:08:44.250 region:rollup2
BY AND LARGE TENDS TO BE MORE

02:08:42.648 --> 02:08:45.084 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE FLANK HERE.

02:08:44.250 --> 02:08:46.819 region:rollup2
AND THAT SORT OF THING THEN

02:08:45.084 --> 02:08:48.354 region:rollup2
ARBITRATION.

02:08:46.819 --> 02:08:50.389 region:rollup2
AND I'M WONDERING IF ANY

02:08:48.354 --> 02:08:51.557 region:rollup2
THOUGHT HAS BEEN GIVEN.

02:08:50.389 --> 02:08:53.025 region:rollup2
THE EFFECT OF THAT AND ON THAT

02:08:51.557 --> 02:08:55.261 region:rollup2
ON.

02:08:53.025 --> 02:08:56.862 region:rollup2
PLAINTIFFS ON PEOPLE THAT.

02:08:55.261 --> 02:08:58.164 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T WANT OR NEED COUNSEL

02:08:56.862 --> 02:08:59.532 region:rollup2
AND MIGHT BE ABLE TO HANDLE OUR

02:08:58.164 --> 02:09:01.701 region:rollup2
PETITION THEMSELVES OR MIGHT BE

02:08:59.532 --> 02:09:03.102 region:rollup2
OPEN MINDED ERNIE. THAT WOULD BE

02:09:01.701 --> 02:09:03.469 region:rollup2
MORE WILLING TO TAKE THAT CASE

02:09:03.102 --> 02:09:05.438 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S A.

02:09:03.469 --> 02:09:07.473 region:rollup2
.

02:09:05.438 --> 02:09:07.840 region:rollup2
LESS SUBSTANTIAL TIME COMMITMENT

02:09:07.473 --> 02:09:09.742 region:rollup2
GREAT QUESTION.

02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:10.977 region:rollup2
THE LABOR CITING THE LABOR

02:09:09.742 --> 02:09:12.178 region:rollup2
COMMISSION WAS SET UP TO HELP

02:09:10.977 --> 02:09:13.546 region:rollup2
THOSE PEOPLE INITIALLY AND AN

02:09:12.178 --> 02:09:14.480 region:rollup2
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT PROHIBITS

02:09:13.546 --> 02:09:15.915 region:rollup2
ACCESS ESSENTIALLY THE LABOR

02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:17.650 region:rollup2
COMMISSION.

02:09:15.915 --> 02:09:19.418 region:rollup2
ALL I DO WHEN I'M NOT SITTING

02:09:17.650 --> 02:09:20.353 region:rollup2
HERE IS REPRESENT PLAINTIFFS

02:09:19.418 --> 02:09:22.588 region:rollup2
AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE MAKES IT

02:09:20.353 --> 02:09:23.155 region:rollup2
LESS LIKELY.

02:09:22.588 --> 02:09:24.257 region:rollup2
THAT OF A LAWYER WILL TAKE A

02:09:23.155 --> 02:09:26.492 region:rollup2
CASE

02:09:24.257 --> 02:09:28.728 region:rollup2
SO IN FACT IT IS AN IMPEDIMENT

02:09:26.492 --> 02:09:31.264 region:rollup2
TO GETTING ACCESS TO JUSTICE.

02:09:28.728 --> 02:09:32.832 region:rollup2
AND AND IN FACT THOSE PEOPLE

02:09:31.264 --> 02:09:34.367 region:rollup2
WHO GO FORWARD ARBITRATION

02:09:32.832 --> 02:09:36.269 region:rollup2
WITHOUT A LAWYER ARE GETTING RUN

02:09:34.367 --> 02:09:38.004 region:rollup2
OVER BY MOTIONS TO DISMISS BY

02:09:36.269 --> 02:09:39.805 region:rollup2
SOME REDUCTION MOTIONS.

02:09:38.004 --> 02:09:41.207 region:rollup2
BELIEVE ME ARBITRATION IS BEING

02:09:39.805 --> 02:09:43.476 region:rollup2
USED AS A FORM OF CLAIMS

02:09:41.207 --> 02:09:46.178 region:rollup2
SUPPRESSION IT IS NOT BEING USED

02:09:43.476 --> 02:09:47.046 region:rollup2
TO CREATE ACCESS TO JUSTICE.

02:09:46.178 --> 02:09:49.382 region:rollup2
THE LABOR COMMISSION AND THE FE

02:09:47.046 --> 02:09:51.884 region:rollup2
H. AND THE PUBLIC COURT SYSTEM.

02:09:49.382 --> 02:09:53.352 region:rollup2
CREATES ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND

02:09:51.884 --> 02:09:55.288 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY ARE WE CONCERNED ABOUT

02:09:53.352 --> 02:09:57.289 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD ACCESS TO DO

02:09:55.288 --> 02:09:58.824 region:rollup2
OUR GOAL HAS TO BE TWO DETERRENT

02:09:57.289 --> 02:10:00.359 region:rollup2
BAD CONDUCT OF THAT PEOPLE DON'T

02:09:58.824 --> 02:10:01.694 region:rollup2
NEED TO GO TO COURT OR NEED TO

02:10:00.359 --> 02:10:02.261 region:rollup2
GET LAWYERS.

02:10:01.694 --> 02:10:04.697 region:rollup2
AND THE DETERRENT EFFECT IS

02:10:02.261 --> 02:10:06.565 region:rollup2
GONE.

02:10:04.697 --> 02:10:08.534 region:rollup2
WHEN WHEN PERPETRATORS THINK

02:10:06.565 --> 02:10:10.736 region:rollup2
THEY CAN HIDE BEHIND SECRET

02:10:08.534 --> 02:10:11.804 region:rollup2
TRIBUNALS AND AND AND FORUMS

02:10:10.736 --> 02:10:13.105 region:rollup2
THAT ARE TILTED IN THEIR FAVOR

02:10:11.804 --> 02:10:14.306 region:rollup2
AN ARBITRATOR SHOULD KNOW THAT

02:10:13.105 --> 02:10:15.775 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO SATISFY THE REPEAT

02:10:14.306 --> 02:10:18.177 region:rollup2
PLAYER.

02:10:15.775 --> 02:10:20.179 region:rollup2
YOUR LAWS ARE NOT BEING SERVED

02:10:18.177 --> 02:10:22.148 region:rollup2
OF THE INTEGRITY OF YOUR LAWS IS

02:10:20.179 --> 02:10:23.082 region:rollup2
BEING UNDERMINED IF IF THEY

02:10:22.148 --> 02:10:25.484 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO TO

02:10:23.082 --> 02:10:27.887 region:rollup2
COURT AND ANYONE. WHO WANTS?

02:10:25.484 --> 02:10:29.722 region:rollup2
TO TAKE A CASE TO MEDIATION OR

02:10:27.887 --> 02:10:32.024 region:rollup2
ARBITRATION OR CONCILIATION. CAN

02:10:29.722 --> 02:10:34.493 region:rollup2
DO THAT.

02:10:32.024 --> 02:10:36.095 region:rollup2
SO.

02:10:34.493 --> 02:10:38.130 region:rollup2
DO YOU DISPUTE THEN I MEAN I. I

02:10:36.095 --> 02:10:39.832 region:rollup2
MEAN I I'VE HAD CASES WHERE ARE

02:10:38.130 --> 02:10:41.734 region:rollup2
WE CAN GET OUR ARBITRATION DATE.

02:10:39.832 --> 02:10:43.336 region:rollup2
YOU'RE YOU YEARS QUICKER THAN WE

02:10:41.734 --> 02:10:44.570 region:rollup2
CAN GET A JURY TRIAL DAY IN

02:10:43.336 --> 02:10:46.205 region:rollup2
COURT AND GET SOME CONCERNED A

02:10:44.570 --> 02:10:48.140 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT GIVEN.

02:10:46.205 --> 02:10:49.108 region:rollup2
AND THE WHOLE MAXIM JUSTICE

02:10:48.140 --> 02:10:51.110 region:rollup2
DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED. OF

02:10:49.108 --> 02:10:52.778 region:rollup2
WHAT.

02:10:51.110 --> 02:10:54.013 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT OVER BURDENS ME COURTS

02:10:52.778 --> 02:10:55.848 region:rollup2
ALREADY WE'VE GOT IMPACTED

02:10:54.013 --> 02:10:56.048 region:rollup2
COURTS IN EVERY COUNTY IN THE

02:10:55.848 --> 02:10:57.817 region:rollup2
STATE.

02:10:56.048 --> 02:10:58.884 region:rollup2
.

02:10:57.817 --> 02:11:01.721 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF THIS GOING

02:10:58.884 --> 02:11:02.755 region:rollup2
TO BE ON?

02:11:01.721 --> 02:11:03.689 region:rollup2
ON THAT KNOW THROUGH IT. IT AT

02:11:02.755 --> 02:11:05.324 region:rollup2
THE PLAINTIFF CAN VOLUNTARILY

02:11:03.689 --> 02:11:07.426 region:rollup2
AGREED AND EARNED ARBITRATION

02:11:05.324 --> 02:11:09.028 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T PREVENT VOLUNTARY

02:11:07.426 --> 02:11:10.229 region:rollup2
ARBITRATION WHEN THERE IS A

02:11:09.028 --> 02:11:11.897 region:rollup2
CLAIM.

02:11:10.229 --> 02:11:13.833 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THESE ARGUMENTS.

02:11:11.897 --> 02:11:15.267 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH CAN BE VALID AT

02:11:13.833 --> 02:11:17.169 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TIMES ARE.

02:11:15.267 --> 02:11:18.704 region:rollup2
ARE.

02:11:17.169 --> 02:11:19.405 region:rollup2
TAKING CARE OF IN THIS BILL IN

02:11:18.704 --> 02:11:20.873 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN ENTER AND

02:11:19.405 --> 02:11:23.309 region:rollup2
ARBITRATION IT JUST ALLOWS THEM

02:11:20.873 --> 02:11:24.210 region:rollup2
TO ALSO IF THEY CHOOSE TO. FILE

02:11:23.309 --> 02:11:27.213 region:rollup2
A LAWSUIT ORBITAL LABOR

02:11:24.210 --> 02:11:29.048 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONER.

02:11:27.213 --> 02:11:30.583 region:rollup2
IT GIVES THE THE VICTIM A FEW

02:11:29.048 --> 02:11:34.620 region:rollup2
WELL I'M THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THE

02:11:30.583 --> 02:11:38.257 region:rollup2
BANJA.

02:11:34.620 --> 02:11:39.325 region:rollup2
THERE IS.

02:11:38.257 --> 02:11:41.293 region:rollup2
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING

02:11:39.325 --> 02:11:41.827 region:rollup2
THIS I THINK THAT FOR SO MANY

02:11:41.293 --> 02:11:46.265 region:rollup2
FOR TRACTION CLAUSES AS A

02:11:41.827 --> 02:11:48.100 region:rollup2
CONDITION

02:11:46.265 --> 02:11:49.802 region:rollup2
OF EMPLOYMENT AS A CONDITION OF

02:11:48.100 --> 02:11:51.604 region:rollup2
LODGING AS A CONDITION OF

02:11:49.802 --> 02:11:52.705 region:rollup2
MEDICAL TREATMENT.

02:11:51.604 --> 02:11:54.039 region:rollup2
AND RIGHTS ARE BEING TAKEN AWAY

02:11:52.705 --> 02:11:55.775 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU YOU DON'T HAVE A

02:11:54.039 --> 02:11:56.776 region:rollup2
CHOICE.

02:11:55.775 --> 02:11:58.611 region:rollup2
I THINK WITH THE COMMENT THAT

02:11:56.776 --> 02:12:00.079 region:rollup2
WAS MADE THIS IS A RIGHTEOUS THE

02:11:58.611 --> 02:12:01.680 region:rollup2
BILL AGREE.

02:12:00.079 --> 02:12:02.748 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A STEP IN

02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:04.750 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT DIRECTION MAKING SURE

02:12:02.748 --> 02:12:05.851 region:rollup2
THAT. IF YOU WANT TO ENTER IF

02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:08.087 region:rollup2
YOU WANT TO GO THROUGH

02:12:05.851 --> 02:12:09.221 region:rollup2
ARBITRATION YOU STILL CAN.

02:12:08.087 --> 02:12:11.323 region:rollup2
THIS BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT IT

02:12:09.221 --> 02:12:15.294 region:rollup2
IN THE WAY THAT I HAVE READ IT.

02:12:11.323 --> 02:12:16.629 region:rollup2
ANYBODY ANYBODY CAN STILL.

02:12:15.294 --> 02:12:18.564 region:rollup2
GO TO ARBITRATION REQUEST

02:12:16.629 --> 02:12:19.965 region:rollup2
ARBITRATION ARE ASKED THE JUDGE

02:12:18.564 --> 02:12:21.867 region:rollup2
TO ORDER THEM TO ARBITRATION

02:12:19.965 --> 02:12:22.435 region:rollup2
THAT'S STILL A POSSIBILITY SO I

02:12:21.867 --> 02:12:23.969 region:rollup2
I DO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING

02:12:22.435 --> 02:12:24.170 region:rollup2
THIS.

02:12:23.969 --> 02:12:26.806 region:rollup2
THIS.

02:12:24.170 --> 02:12:28.741 region:rollup2
BILL FORWARD.

02:12:26.806 --> 02:12:30.776 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MS WEBER.

02:12:28.741 --> 02:12:31.710 region:rollup2
YES I TO WHAT IT OF THANK YOU

02:12:30.776 --> 02:12:33.112 region:rollup2
FOR BRINGING THE BILL FOR IT I

02:12:31.710 --> 02:12:34.380 region:rollup2
KNOW IT'S OF THESE ARBITRATION

02:12:33.112 --> 02:12:36.215 region:rollup2
AGREEMENTS IN THE BILLS ARE VERY

02:12:34.380 --> 02:12:37.650 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO GET OUT AND GET THE

02:12:36.215 --> 02:12:39.952 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR TO SIGN THEM.

02:12:37.650 --> 02:12:41.487 region:rollup2
AND SIGH I HOPE ALL GOES WELL

02:12:39.952 --> 02:12:42.955 region:rollup2
WITH YOU WE HAD QUITE A BATTLE

02:12:41.487 --> 02:12:44.857 region:rollup2
WITH THE ONE THAT IDEA. YOU KNOW

02:12:42.955 --> 02:12:46.225 region:rollup2
IT IT IT IS A TRAGIC THAT WE SEE

02:12:44.857 --> 02:12:48.861 region:rollup2
ARBITRATION IS THIS GREAT

02:12:46.225 --> 02:12:49.495 region:rollup2
PANACEA AS A SHORT CUT TO

02:12:48.861 --> 02:12:50.095 region:rollup2
JUSTICE BECAUSE THERE REALLY IS

02:12:49.495 --> 02:12:51.831 region:rollup2
NOT.

02:12:50.095 --> 02:12:52.998 region:rollup2
AND I SAY THAT NOT JUST AS THE

02:12:51.831 --> 02:12:55.000 region:rollup2
AUTHOR OF THE BILL BUT AS A

02:12:52.998 --> 02:12:55.835 region:rollup2
PERSON WENT TO ARBITRATION I

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.770 region:rollup2
WOULD NEVER GO TO ARBITRATION

02:12:55.835 --> 02:12:59.138 region:rollup2
AGAIN. IT IS TRULY A VIOLATION

02:12:57.770 --> 02:13:00.806 region:rollup2
OF YOUR RIGHTS IS NOT ALWAYS A

02:12:59.138 --> 02:13:02.107 region:rollup2
SHORT QUICK THING. YOU HAVE TO

02:13:00.806 --> 02:13:03.342 region:rollup2
HAVE AN ATTORNEY AND IT IS

02:13:02.107 --> 02:13:04.610 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES EXPENSIVE.

02:13:03.342 --> 02:13:05.511 region:rollup2
AND THOSE WHO HEAR THE CASES ARE

02:13:04.610 --> 02:13:06.812 region:rollup2
NOT ALWAYS THE BEST PEOPLE TO

02:13:05.511 --> 02:13:08.347 region:rollup2
HEAR CASES.

02:13:06.812 --> 02:13:09.882 region:rollup2
AND THEY GENERALLY ARE GOING TO

02:13:08.347 --> 02:13:10.583 region:rollup2
FAVOR THE EMPLOYER BECAUSE

02:13:09.882 --> 02:13:12.618 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE PEOPLE KEEP USING

02:13:10.583 --> 02:13:14.253 region:rollup2
THEIR SERVICES.

02:13:12.618 --> 02:13:15.287 region:rollup2
SO I MEAN THAT ONLY THAT GO TO

02:13:14.253 --> 02:13:16.255 region:rollup2
ARBITRATION HAD TO. COMPLAIN

02:13:15.287 --> 02:13:17.756 region:rollup2
AFTERWARDS BECAUSE OF THE

02:13:16.255 --> 02:13:18.891 region:rollup2
PROCESS

02:13:17.756 --> 02:13:20.292 region:rollup2
AND YOU DON'T FEEL THIS IS SHOW

02:13:18.891 --> 02:13:21.861 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'VE GOTTEN JUSTICE AND

02:13:20.292 --> 02:13:23.028 region:rollup2
SO I THINK. THE FACT THAT SO

02:13:21.861 --> 02:13:24.563 region:rollup2
MANY FOLKS ARE BEING FORCED INTO

02:13:23.028 --> 02:13:25.865 region:rollup2
THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT BASED

02:13:24.563 --> 02:13:27.066 region:rollup2
ON THE FACT THAT THEY MAY NOT

02:13:25.865 --> 02:13:28.501 region:rollup2
HAVE THE MONEY THEY MAY I HAVE

02:13:27.066 --> 02:13:31.637 region:rollup2
THIS MAY HAVE THAT. YOU KNOW IT

02:13:28.501 --> 02:13:32.071 region:rollup2
JOB IT REALLY DOES PLAY TO THOSE

02:13:31.637 --> 02:13:34.907 region:rollup2
WHO ARE AT LEAST.

02:13:32.071 --> 02:13:36.308 region:rollup2
ABLE TO AFFORD JUSTICE

02:13:34.907 --> 02:13:37.743 region:rollup2
AND THEN YOU AFTER THE PROCESS

02:13:36.308 --> 02:13:38.611 region:rollup2
YOU STILL HAVEN'T REALLY GOTTEN

02:13:37.743 --> 02:13:39.979 region:rollup2
A JUSTICE SOMETIMES THAT YOU

02:13:38.611 --> 02:13:42.181 region:rollup2
WANT THERE'S SOME ARBITRATION

02:13:39.979 --> 02:13:43.249 region:rollup2
GOES WELL BUT I'VE. HEARD NUMBER

02:13:42.181 --> 02:13:44.717 region:rollup2
OF FOLKS WHO WOULD IT IS NOT

02:13:43.249 --> 02:13:45.985 region:rollup2
DONE WELL AND SO I THINK THE

02:13:44.717 --> 02:13:47.653 region:rollup2
MORE WE CAN.

02:13:45.985 --> 02:13:50.189 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO LOOK ARBITRATION AS

02:13:47.653 --> 02:13:51.657 region:rollup2
AN OPTION AND NOT A REQUIREMENT

02:13:50.189 --> 02:13:53.659 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THE WHOLE CHANNELS IT

02:13:51.657 --> 02:13:55.528 region:rollup2
SHOULD ALWAYS BE AN OPTION AND

02:13:53.659 --> 02:13:57.463 region:rollup2
NOT A REQUIREMENT FOR YOU TO GET

02:13:55.528 --> 02:13:58.898 region:rollup2
A JOB OR GET A HOUSE OR. OR THE

02:13:57.463 --> 02:14:00.766 region:rollup2
KID TO GO TO A PARTICULAR SCHOOL

02:13:58.898 --> 02:14:01.767 region:rollup2
OR WHATEVER BABY YOU STILL

02:14:00.766 --> 02:14:03.168 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE IT SHOULD BE AN

02:14:01.767 --> 02:14:04.870 region:rollup2
OPTION. BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE SO

02:14:03.168 --> 02:14:06.372 region:rollup2
THIS FORCED ON INDIVIDUALS AND I

02:14:04.870 --> 02:14:07.439 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FOR

02:14:06.372 --> 02:14:09.208 region:rollup2
I KNOW WE'RE CROSSING KNOCKING

02:14:07.439 --> 02:14:10.276 region:rollup2
AT THE DOOR OF ARBITRATION. AND

02:14:09.208 --> 02:14:12.378 region:rollup2
AND I MOST FOLKS THINK

02:14:10.276 --> 02:14:14.513 region:rollup2
ARBITRATION IS SUPPOSED TO BE

02:14:12.378 --> 02:14:17.116 region:rollup2
VOLUNTARY AND NOT A PRE

02:14:14.513 --> 02:14:18.250 region:rollup2
CONDITION FOR GETTING SOMETHING

02:14:17.116 --> 02:14:19.952 region:rollup2
OF THAT'S THEY A CYPRESS SHAPE

02:14:18.250 --> 02:14:23.556 region:rollup2
THAT THE BILL THANK YOU FOR ALL

02:14:19.952 --> 02:14:24.456 region:rollup2
YOUR HARD WORK. AND UP I TOTALLY

02:14:23.556 --> 02:14:28.294 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THE BILL.

02:14:24.456 --> 02:14:29.428 region:rollup2
THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COME.

02:14:28.294 --> 02:14:31.463 region:rollup2
SEEING NONE WAS CONSULTS LUXURY

02:14:29.428 --> 02:14:32.665 region:rollup2
MIKLOS THANK YOU I THINK THAT.

02:14:31.463 --> 02:14:33.799 region:rollup2

COMMITTEE SO ENGAGE ON THIS

02:14:33.799 --> 02:14:36.368 region:rollup2
TOPIC WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT AND

02:14:35.534 --> 02:14:38.504 region:rollup2
I'M ONE OF THE STEPS IN

02:14:36.368 --> 02:14:41.140 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING. WHAT WE'VE SEEN AS

02:14:38.504 --> 02:14:43.575 region:rollup2
AS WORKPLACE HARASSMENT ASSAULT

02:14:41.140 --> 02:14:45.244 region:rollup2
COM? PAY INEQUITY YOU NAME IT

02:14:43.575 --> 02:14:47.246 region:rollup2
REALLY SHINING A LIGHT ON THESE

02:14:45.244 --> 02:14:48.647 region:rollup2
ISSUES I'M AGAIN I I WANT TO

02:14:47.246 --> 02:14:50.316 region:rollup2
REITERATE THAT WE ARE NOT TAKE

02:14:48.647 --> 02:14:51.917 region:rollup2
AWAY THE RIGHT OF ANY PLAINTIFF

02:14:50.316 --> 02:14:53.285 region:rollup2
TO SEEK ARBITRATION. WE'RE JUST

02:14:51.917 --> 02:14:55.220 region:rollup2
ENSURING THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY A

02:19:51.216 --> 02:19:55.087 region:rollup2
UP PROHIBITED REASONS THAT MEANS

02:19:53.185 --> 02:19:56.922 region:rollup2
THAT MOST WORKERS SERVE AT THE

02:19:55.087 --> 02:19:59.091 region:rollup2
MERCY OF THEIR EMPLOYER THEY

02:19:56.922 --> 02:20:00.626 region:rollup2
CANNOT SPEAK OUT THEY CANNOT

02:19:59.091 --> 02:20:03.462 region:rollup2
COMPLAIN THEY CANNOT FILE A

02:20:00.626 --> 02:20:05.430 region:rollup2
CLAIM OR THEY WILL BE FIRED. AND

02:20:03.462 --> 02:20:07.032 region:rollup2
FOR THAT REASON WE HAVE TO MAKE

02:20:05.430 --> 02:20:08.867 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THE LAW IS MORE

02:20:07.032 --> 02:20:10.168 region:rollup2
PROTECTIVE OF THOSE WORKERS THAT

02:20:08.867 --> 02:20:12.337 region:rollup2
WHEN WORKERS COME FORWARD AND

02:20:10.168 --> 02:20:14.373 region:rollup2
FILE A CLAIM. FOR EXAMPLE THAT

02:20:12.337 --> 02:20:15.841 region:rollup2
THERE'S A IT IF THEY GET FIRED

02:20:14.373 --> 02:20:16.908 region:rollup2
RIGHT AFTER THEY FILE A CLAIM

02:20:15.841 --> 02:20:18.610 region:rollup2
THERE SHOULD BE A PRESUMPTION

02:20:16.908 --> 02:20:20.178 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WERE FIRED BECAUSE

02:20:18.610 --> 02:20:21.947 region:rollup2
THEY SPOKE OUT ABOUT THAT CLAIM.

02:20:20.178 --> 02:20:23.849 region:rollup2
AND THE EMPLOYER I. HAS ALL OF

02:20:21.947 --> 02:20:25.517 region:rollup2
THE TOOLS AT THEIR DISPOSAL TO

02:20:23.849 --> 02:20:27.486 region:rollup2
SHOW IF THERE WAS A LEGITIMATE

02:20:25.517 --> 02:20:28.921 region:rollup2
REASON BUT A LOW WAGE IMMIGRANT

02:20:27.486 --> 02:20:30.789 region:rollup2
WOMAN WHO'S FACING SEXUAL

02:20:28.921 --> 02:20:31.890 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT AND TRIES TO REPORT

02:20:30.789 --> 02:20:33.225 region:rollup2
IT AND GETS FIRED. IS IN A MUCH

02:20:31.890 --> 02:20:34.192 region:rollup2
HARDER POSITION TO TRY TO

02:20:33.225 --> 02:20:36.028 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH THAT IT WAS

02:20:34.192 --> 02:20:37.162 region:rollup2
RETALIATORY BECAUSE AGAIN SHE

02:20:36.028 --> 02:20:39.164 region:rollup2
THAT WELLING CAN GET FIRED FOR

02:20:37.162 --> 02:20:40.899 region:rollup2
ANY REASON. AND THE OTHER ISSUE

02:20:39.164 --> 02:20:42.467 region:rollup2
WE'VE TRIED TO ADDRESS HERE OUR

02:20:40.899 --> 02:20:44.903 region:rollup2
ECONOMY IS INCREASINGLY

02:20:42.467 --> 02:20:47.039 region:rollup2
DEPENDENT ON CONTRACTED OUT AND

02:20:44.903 --> 02:20:48.507 region:rollup2

02:20:47.039 --> 02:20:50.575 region:rollup2
THE JOBS CREATED SINCE THE LAST

02:20:48.507 --> 02:20:51.843 region:rollup2

CALL CONTINGENT WORK THESE

02:20:53.645 --> 02:20:57.649 region:rollup2

02:20:55.013 --> 02:20:59.051 region:rollup2

02:20:59.051 --> 02:21:03.689 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER.

02:20:59.885 --> 02:21:04.323 region:rollup2
HAS CONTRACTORS COME IN AND OUT

02:21:03.689 --> 02:21:06.124 region:rollup2
THOSE CONTRACTORS PROVIDE THE TO

02:21:04.323 --> 02:21:07.359 region:rollup2
SUPERVISION AND THEN WHEN

02:21:06.124 --> 02:21:08.894 region:rollup2
WORKERS RIGHTS ARE VIOLATED THE

02:21:07.359 --> 02:21:09.861 region:rollup2
KLAN EMPLOYER SAYS I HAD NOTHING

02:21:08.894 --> 02:21:10.929 region:rollup2
TO DO WITH THAT BLAME THE

02:21:09.861 --> 02:21:13.198 region:rollup2

02:21:13.198 --> 02:21:16.768 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD APPLY THE SAME

02:21:14.566 --> 02:21:18.136 region:rollup2

WHERE THE CLIENT EMPLOYER IS

02:21:19.871 --> 02:21:23.008 region:rollup2
HELD ACCOUNTABLE IF THEIR

02:21:21.106 --> 02:21:24.076 region:rollup2

02:21:23.008 --> 02:21:25.610 region:rollup2
AFTER VIOLATIONS OF WORKER

HEALTH TO HEALTH AND SAFETY WE

02:21:25.610 --> 02:21:29.081 region:rollup2

AND THAT ONE OF THE KEY

02:25:57.916 --> 02:26:01.052 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A LARGER

02:25:59.084 --> 02:26:02.854 region:rollup2

TRYING TO COMPLY. WITH ARE

02:26:11.029 --> 02:26:14.432 region:rollup2
ALREADY VERY COMPLEX LABOR LAWS

02:26:12.597 --> 02:26:16.167 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS AND UNFORTUNATELY

02:26:14.432 --> 02:26:17.068 region:rollup2
WE VIEW THIS BILL WOULD CREATE

02:26:16.167 --> 02:26:19.337 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL.

02:26:17.068 --> 02:26:22.073 region:rollup2
CONTRADICTIONS AND DUPLICATIONS

02:26:19.337 --> 02:26:23.341 region:rollup2
ARMS SPECIFICALLY BY ADDING A

02:26:22.073 --> 02:26:24.509 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT PROTECTIONS IN

TO THE LABOR CODE ITSELF IT

02:26:26.044 --> 02:26:29.247 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A CONFUSING TO SMALL

02:26:27.479 --> 02:26:30.815 region:rollup2
BUSINESS OWNERS. BUT ALSO OPEN

02:26:29.247 --> 02:26:33.351 region:rollup2

02:26:30.815 --> 02:26:34.819 region:rollup2
WAVE OF LITIGATION UNDER PAGO

02:26:33.351 --> 02:26:36.288 region:rollup2
WHICH WE THINK SEPARATELY IS

02:26:34.819 --> 02:26:37.255 region:rollup2
OVERDUE FOR REFORM ITSELF.

02:26:36.288 --> 02:26:38.757 region:rollup2
BUT NONE OF THIS WOULD DO

02:26:37.255 --> 02:26:41.092 region:rollup2
ANYTHING TO INCREASE OUR ALREADY

02:26:38.757 --> 02:26:42.794 region:rollup2

WHAT'S ALREADY AVAILABLE IN FEE

02:26:48.967 --> 02:26:52.537 region:rollup2
HOT IN THE FE H. BOB INSTEAD

02:26:51.236 --> 02:26:53.605 region:rollup2
ONLY ADDS COMPLICATION POTENTIAL

02:26:52.537 --> 02:26:56.708 region:rollup2
LITIGATION.

02:26:53.605 --> 02:26:57.976 region:rollup2

EXPANSIVE THIS ISSUE IS AND HOW

02:28:20.458 --> 02:28:23.461 region:rollup2

02:28:37.175 --> 02:28:40.812 region:rollup2

THOROUGH IT IDENTIFIES A COUPLE

02:32:54.999 --> 02:32:59.203 region:rollup2

02:33:05.643 --> 02:33:09.447 region:rollup2
OF.

02:33:07.412 --> 02:33:09.847 region:rollup2

AND.

02:33:20.158 --> 02:33:24.562 region:rollup2

02:33:22.960 --> 02:33:25.630 region:rollup2
THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED

02:33:24.562 --> 02:33:28.533 region:rollup2

A EVERYONE AGREES

02:33:31.702 --> 02:33:34.505 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:33:33.704 --> 02:33:36.007 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WANT TO BE IN A

02:33:34.505 --> 02:33:39.877 region:rollup2
POSITION.

02:33:36.007 --> 02:33:41.946 region:rollup2
WHERE THE DISSOLUTION OF A JPA?

02:33:39.877 --> 02:33:43.881 region:rollup2
MEANS MEMBERS RETIREMENT

02:33:41.946 --> 02:33:45.183 region:rollup2
DISAPPEAR.

02:33:43.881 --> 02:33:46.117 region:rollup2
IT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SAN

02:33:45.183 --> 02:33:47.685 region:rollup2
GABRIEL ALMOST TWO HUNDRED

02:33:46.117 --> 02:33:49.921 region:rollup2

02:33:47.685 --> 02:33:51.456 region:rollup2
SO OTHER RETIREMENT CUT TO SIXTY

02:33:49.921 --> 02:33:53.357 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF WHAT THEY.

02:33:51.456 --> 02:33:54.726 region:rollup2
THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE OR

02:33:53.357 --> 02:33:57.095 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY

02:33:54.726 --> 02:33:57.628 region:rollup2
RECEIVING IN THE IN THE INSTANCE

02:33:57.095 --> 02:33:59.063 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE WHO WERE ALREADY

02:33:57.628 --> 02:34:01.399 region:rollup2
RETIRED.

02:33:59.063 --> 02:34:02.400 region:rollup2
HAVING SAID THAT THE OPPOSITION

02:34:01.399 --> 02:34:04.135 region:rollup2
IS BROUGHT NOTHING FORWARD TO

02:34:02.400 --> 02:34:06.204 region:rollup2
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.

02:34:04.135 --> 02:34:08.139 region:rollup2
WORDS ARE CHEAP.

02:34:06.204 --> 02:34:10.041 region:rollup2
ACTIONS MEAN SOMETHING WE'VE

02:34:08.139 --> 02:34:10.641 region:rollup2
AMENDED THE BILL WITH THE HELP

02:34:10.041 --> 02:34:13.144 region:rollup2
OF.

02:34:10.641 --> 02:34:14.445 region:rollup2
YOUR STAFF STAFF IN THE PURSE

02:34:13.144 --> 02:34:17.081 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE.

02:34:14.445 --> 02:34:18.816 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SOME ACCOMODATIONS.

02:34:17.081 --> 02:34:20.818 region:rollup2
BUT THEY STILL ARGUE

02:34:18.816 --> 02:34:23.721 region:rollup2
THAT A PLACES SUBSTANTIAL

02:34:20.818 --> 02:34:25.923 region:rollup2
BURDENS AND IS UNWORKABLE.

02:34:23.721 --> 02:34:27.558 region:rollup2
AND AND ELSEWHERE STATE THAT

02:34:25.923 --> 02:34:29.060 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO IT IT

02:34:27.558 --> 02:34:30.027 region:rollup2
CAN'T BE BOTH.

02:34:29.060 --> 02:34:31.662 region:rollup2
AND WE KNOW IN FACT IT IS

02:34:30.027 --> 02:34:33.431 region:rollup2
WORKABLE.

02:34:31.662 --> 02:34:35.800 region:rollup2
BECAUSE CALPERS ALREADY DOES

02:34:33.431 --> 02:34:37.235 region:rollup2
THIS THERE ARE SEVERAL JPA HE'S.

02:34:35.800 --> 02:34:38.202 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE CONTRACTED WITH

02:34:37.235 --> 02:34:39.070 region:rollup2

AGENCIES.

02:34:41.272 --> 02:34:45.176 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NOT UNWORKABLE AND YES

02:34:43.074 --> 02:34:46.611 region:rollup2
IT'S DIFFICULT BUT IT'S FAR LESS

02:34:45.176 --> 02:34:48.346 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT THAN SURVIVING AND

02:34:46.611 --> 02:34:49.213 region:rollup2
SIXTY PERCENT OF WHAT YOU

02:34:48.346 --> 02:34:50.948 region:rollup2
THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA GET IN

02:34:49.213 --> 02:34:54.619 region:rollup2
RETIREMENT.

02:34:50.948 --> 02:34:56.354 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO A CONSTITUTIONAL

02:34:54.619 --> 02:34:57.989 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT MADE BY THE LEAGUE

02:34:56.354 --> 02:35:00.091 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CITIES.

02:34:57.989 --> 02:35:01.592 region:rollup2
THAT SO TORTURED LAUGHABLE THAT

02:35:00.091 --> 02:35:03.995 region:rollup2
IT WASN'T EVEN RECOGNIZED BY

02:35:01.592 --> 02:35:04.862 region:rollup2
THIS COMMITTEE A PRIOR COMMITTEE

02:35:03.995 --> 02:35:06.831 region:rollup2

WERE DOING THE DRAFTING.

02:35:08.466 --> 02:35:14.038 region:rollup2
WITH THAT I THINK.

02:35:10.868 --> 02:35:15.606 region:rollup2
POLITICS CLOSE BY SAYING.

02:35:14.038 --> 02:35:17.141 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WANT THIS TO EVER

02:35:15.606 --> 02:35:20.178 region:rollup2
HAPPEN AGAIN.

02:35:17.141 --> 02:35:22.180 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I AM

02:35:20.178 --> 02:35:23.481 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD IT'S NOT GOING TO

02:35:22.180 --> 02:35:26.117 region:rollup2
HAPPEN CALPERS HAS CHANGED THEIR

02:35:23.481 --> 02:35:28.386 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES ANY NEW JP A FULL BE

02:35:26.117 --> 02:35:30.121 region:rollup2

JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY

02:35:32.089 --> 02:35:34.992 region:rollup2
THIS IS FOR THE.

GPAS FORMED.

02:37:15.559 --> 02:37:19.764 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD REQUIRE.

SOME FORM OF LIABILITY PRIOR TO

02:38:02.006 --> 02:38:04.976 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY WE BELIEVE THAT

THIS LEGISLATION WILL ACTUALLY

02:38:04.976 --> 02:38:10.348 region:rollup2

02:38:17.788 --> 02:38:21.625 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO CHOOSE TO NOT

02:38:19.824 --> 02:38:23.361 region:rollup2
ACCEPT THAT LIABILITY. OF THE

02:38:21.625 --> 02:38:24.929 region:rollup2
JPA WILL HAVE NO OTHER OPTION

02:38:23.361 --> 02:38:25.896 region:rollup2

THOSE LIABILITIES UNDER THIS

02:38:38.976 --> 02:38:42.680 region:rollup2

A HOWEVER THEY WOULD ACCRUE NO

02:38:44.215 --> 02:38:47.351 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL LIABILITY BECAUSE THE

02:38:46.117 --> 02:38:49.020 region:rollup2

HOWEVER WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS

02:39:33.597 --> 02:39:35.866 region:rollup2
WILL RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF

02:39:35.166 --> 02:39:37.368 region:rollup2

THE THAT THIS IS NOT EASY AND

02:44:12.509 --> 02:44:15.212 region:rollup2
IT'S A COMPLICATED ISSUE. AYE

02:44:13.944 --> 02:44:16.180 region:rollup2

ISSUE WON'T REOCCUR.

02:44:28.926 --> 02:44:32.696 region:rollup2
BUT THAT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

02:44:31.095 --> 02:44:35.966 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD SIT IDLY BY.

02:44:32.696 --> 02:44:37.267 region:rollup2
IN IN TERMS OF DOING TAKING

02:44:35.966 --> 02:44:39.837 region:rollup2
RETROACTIVE ACTION.

I UNDERSTAND THAT.

02:44:39.837 --> 02:44:41.939 region:rollup2
THE JURISDICTIONS TO NESTLE

02:44:41.739 --> 02:44:43.841 region:rollup2
KNOW.

02:44:41.939 --> 02:44:46.176 region:rollup2
OF OF A POTENTIAL OP GAZE

02:44:43.841 --> 02:44:47.277 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THEY DO THEY ARE.

02:44:46.176 --> 02:44:48.746 region:rollup2
AS PART OF THE GPAS.

02:44:47.277 --> 02:44:49.313 region:rollup2
.

02:44:48.746 --> 02:44:51.648 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THEY DO HAVE AN

02:44:49.313 --> 02:44:53.684 region:rollup2
OBLIGATION TO ENSURE THAT.

02:44:51.648 --> 02:44:54.585 region:rollup2
THE WORK GETS DONE.

02:44:53.684 --> 02:44:55.419 region:rollup2
THE WORD DOES GET DONE FOR

02:44:54.585 --> 02:44:56.687 region:rollup2
THEIR BENEFIT.

02:44:55.419 --> 02:44:57.888 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE WERE A THEIR

02:44:56.687 --> 02:44:59.623 region:rollup2
WORKERS ARE WORKING HARD TO MAKE

02:44:57.888 --> 02:45:00.924 region:rollup2
IT HAPPEN THE. JUST LIKE THE

02:44:59.623 --> 02:45:02.226 region:rollup2
CITIES OR OTHER JUST EXISTING

02:45:00.924 --> 02:45:04.261 region:rollup2
CHOOSE.

02:45:02.226 --> 02:45:05.963 region:rollup2
A TO ENTER THE JP IS WITH THIS

02:45:04.261 --> 02:45:07.664 region:rollup2
AS UNDERSTANDING THE WORKERS

02:45:05.963 --> 02:45:08.732 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES ALSO DID NOT CHOOSE.

02:45:07.664 --> 02:45:10.033 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THEIR BENEFITS SLASH

02:45:08.732 --> 02:45:11.435 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY CHOSE TO WORK IN

02:45:10.033 --> 02:45:14.271 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SERVICE FOR THE BENEFIT

02:45:11.435 --> 02:45:14.838 region:rollup2
OF A JPA IT THEY HAD MAYBE THEY

02:45:14.271 --> 02:45:15.272 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE DOES NOT WORK FOR

02:45:14.838 --> 02:45:16.340 region:rollup2
JPA.

02:45:15.272 --> 02:45:18.208 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK WE HAVE THE

02:45:16.340 --> 02:45:19.576 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO FIX THIS I AGREE

02:45:18.208 --> 02:45:20.577 region:rollup2
WITH WITH EVERYONE THAT SPOKE ON

02:45:19.576 --> 02:45:22.646 region:rollup2
BOTH SIDES AND IT IS A

02:45:20.577 --> 02:45:24.148 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED ISSUE. AND I HOPE

02:45:22.646 --> 02:45:25.749 region:rollup2
EVERYONE WILL COME TO THE TABLE.

02:45:24.148 --> 02:45:28.852 region:rollup2
AND AND GOING FORWARD FIGURE

02:45:25.749 --> 02:45:29.353 region:rollup2
OUT WAYS THAT WE HOPE THAT NONE

02:45:28.852 --> 02:45:31.188 region:rollup2
OF THE JP IS DISSOLVED.

02:45:29.353 --> 02:45:33.190 region:rollup2

02:45:34.324 --> 02:45:37.628 region:rollup2
THOUGH THE WORKERS ARE MADE

02:45:35.859 --> 02:45:39.763 region:rollup2

02:45:37.628 --> 02:45:41.064 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WITH THIS BILL OF

02:45:39.763 --> 02:45:42.766 region:rollup2

03:23:09.177 --> 03:23:11.780 region:rollup2
FOREMOST THERE'S A PROVISION

03:23:10.178 --> 03:23:13.481 region:rollup2
REGARDING CONFIDENTIALITY THIS

03:23:11.780 --> 03:23:15.483 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS DIFFERENT

03:23:13.481 --> 03:23:16.651 region:rollup2
THAN SEXUAL ASSAULT. OR STOCKING

03:23:15.483 --> 03:23:17.685 region:rollup2
OR ANY OF THE OTHER PROVISIONS

03:23:16.651 --> 03:23:19.621 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS DOES HAPPEN IN THE

03:23:17.685 --> 03:23:20.655 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE EMPLOYERS ARE REQUIRED

03:23:19.621 --> 03:23:21.589 region:rollup2
BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR

03:23:20.655 --> 03:23:22.557 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT HOUSING TO CONDUCT A

03:23:21.589 --> 03:23:23.625 region:rollup2
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION WHICH

03:23:22.557 --> 03:23:25.060 region:rollup2
REQUIRES INTERVIEWING THE

03:23:23.625 --> 03:23:26.694 region:rollup2
WITNESSES AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS

03:23:25.060 --> 03:23:28.029 region:rollup2
WITHIN. THE EMPLOYMENT ROWMAN SO

03:23:26.694 --> 03:23:30.098 region:rollup2
THEREFORE THE EMPLOYER CANNOT

03:23:28.029 --> 03:23:32.100 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE CONFIDENTIALITY OF AN

03:23:30.098 --> 03:23:33.401 region:rollup2
IMPLICATION. OF AN EMPLOYEE WHO

03:23:32.100 --> 03:23:35.103 region:rollup2
IS TAKING TIME OFF FROM WORK

03:23:33.401 --> 03:23:36.071 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND

03:23:35.103 --> 03:23:37.338 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY THE EMPLOYER WOULD

03:23:36.071 --> 03:23:38.807 region:rollup2
BE IN VIOLATION OF THE HOT THEY

03:23:37.338 --> 03:23:40.075 region:rollup2
DID NOT CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION

03:23:38.807 --> 03:23:41.976 region:rollup2
OUR CONCERN IS THAT IF AN

03:23:40.075 --> 03:23:43.378 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE WHO TAKES TIME OFF. AND

03:23:41.976 --> 03:23:44.479 region:rollup2
THAT IS THAT TAKES HIM OFF IN

03:23:43.378 --> 03:23:45.447 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYEE CANNOT CONDUCT THE

03:23:44.479 --> 03:23:46.715 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION BECAUSE THE

03:23:45.447 --> 03:23:48.183 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER WOULD THEN BE AN

03:23:46.715 --> 03:23:49.851 region:rollup2
IMPLICATION OF WAGING OUR

03:23:48.183 --> 03:23:51.786 region:rollup2

OR REQUESTING THAT THEY COME

03:23:53.088 --> 03:23:55.990 region:rollup2
INTO THE OFFICE FOR AN

03:23:54.489 --> 03:23:57.892 region:rollup2

03:24:00.161 --> 03:24:02.964 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD OCCUR AND SO THERE IS

03:24:01.796 --> 03:24:04.432 region:rollup2
KIND OF THAT ISSUE HOW DO YOU

03:24:02.964 --> 03:24:05.900 region:rollup2

ALSO EXTREMELY BURDENSOME ON AN

03:24:10.772 --> 03:24:13.908 region:rollup2
EMPLOYER BECAUSE IT WOULD EXTEND

03:24:12.240 --> 03:24:15.043 region:rollup2

IN THE BILL THE AUTHOR HAS

03:26:28.810 --> 03:26:33.982 region:rollup2
REFERENCE SECTION TWO FORTY FIVE

03:26:31.112 --> 03:26:34.482 region:rollup2
POINT FIVE. TO DEFINE A FAMILY

03:26:33.982 --> 03:26:36.351 region:rollup2

03:26:34.482 --> 03:26:38.887 region:rollup2
BROADER.

03:26:36.351 --> 03:26:39.554 region:rollup2
I THINK THAN WHAT WAS CONTAINED

03:26:38.887 --> 03:26:41.089 region:rollup2
IN THE PRIOR VERSION OF THE BILL

03:26:39.554 --> 03:26:42.290 region:rollup2
BUT SUCH BUDGET TO SAY I THINK

03:26:41.089 --> 03:26:44.425 region:rollup2
THE CONCERN WITH THE FAMILY

03:26:42.290 --> 03:26:45.793 region:rollup2
MEMBER IS. THERE'S NO

03:26:44.425 --> 03:26:47.996 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTATION THERE.

03:26:45.793 --> 03:26:49.764 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS A SECONDARY EMPLOYER

03:26:47.996 --> 03:26:51.599 region:rollup2
THE ONE EMPLOYEE I SUFFERED

03:26:49.764 --> 03:26:53.268 region:rollup2

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT

03:26:53.268 --> 03:26:57.872 region:rollup2
CETERA FOR THE FAMILY MEMBER.

03:26:56.404 --> 03:26:59.274 region:rollup2
THEY CAN TAKE THAT LEAVE AND

03:26:57.872 --> 03:27:01.376 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO CERTIFICATION OR

03:26:59.274 --> 03:27:03.578 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTATION RELATED TO THAT

03:27:01.376 --> 03:27:04.879 region:rollup2

PUTTING EVERYTHING ON THE LINE

03:44:08.635 --> 03:44:12.572 region:rollup2

NEED TIME TO CONSIDER THE

03:44:33.593 --> 03:44:36.730 region:rollup2

PLAYERS THAT INCLUDE THOUSANDS

03:45:19.940 --> 03:45:22.409 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA COLLEGE ATHLETES

03:45:21.808 --> 03:45:23.610 region:rollup2

03:45:23.610 --> 03:45:27.447 region:rollup2

03:45:24.845 --> 03:45:28.015 region:rollup2
PRICE FIXING SCHEME.

03:45:27.447 --> 03:45:29.549 region:rollup2
AND IT'S A STUDY FOUND THAT

03:45:28.015 --> 03:45:30.751 region:rollup2

03:45:30.751 --> 03:45:33.954 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE TIME TO KEEP UP WITH

03:45:31.852 --> 03:45:35.655 region:rollup2

FOR COLLEGE ATHLETES.

03:45:39.359 --> 03:45:41.194 region:rollup2
WHY SHOULD THE STATE OF

CALIFORNIA FOLLOW THE NCAA'S

03:45:41.194 --> 03:45:43.997 region:rollup2

03:45:43.196 --> 03:45:45.365 region:rollup2
WHY SHOULD IT LEAVE ABUSE

03:45:43.997 --> 03:45:47.734 region:rollup2

03:45:51.571 --> 03:45:55.041 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WHEN CALIFORNIA CUT

03:45:53.140 --> 03:45:55.609 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AFTER GRADUATION RATES.

03:45:55.041 --> 03:45:57.377 region:rollup2

03:45:55.609 --> 03:45:58.712 region:rollup2
COUNTRY.

03:45:57.377 --> 03:45:59.679 region:rollup2
IT'S EASY TO DISCREDIT FALSE

03:45:58.712 --> 03:46:01.581 region:rollup2
ARGUMENTS AGAINST A DEGREE

03:45:59.679 --> 03:46:02.482 region:rollup2

03:46:07.487 --> 03:46:09.856 region:rollup2
FACTOR FUELING OPPOSITION. TO

03:46:09.289 --> 03:46:11.658 region:rollup2
INCREASING COMPENSATION FOR

COLLEGE ATHLETES.

03:46:11.658 --> 03:46:13.660 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD

03:46:12.459 --> 03:46:14.461 region:rollup2
NOT ALLOW RACIAL RESENTMENT TO

03:46:13.660 --> 03:46:16.496 region:rollup2

EMPOWER PLAYERS TO END ABUSES.

03:46:20.267 --> 03:46:24.037 region:rollup2
HOW CALIFORNIA COLLEGES TO SOLVE

03:46:22.068 --> 03:46:25.906 region:rollup2

IF APPROVED ATHLETES WILL GAIN

03:46:34.481 --> 03:46:37.684 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS IN GRADUATION RATES

03:46:35.782 --> 03:46:38.251 region:rollup2

INSTEAD OF PACING A CLOSURE THAT

OUR HOSPITALS ARE EXPERIENCING

CHEFS AND HOW WE OPERATE THOSE

03:57:20.159 --> 03:57:24.030 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS AS WE MOVE FOLKS AWAY

URGENT CARE CENTERS ON THEIR

03:57:25.098 --> 03:57:28.134 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE CENTER AND SO WE

03:57:26.432 --> 03:57:29.202 region:rollup2
HAVE LOWER VOLUMES

03:57:28.134 --> 03:57:30.903 region:rollup2
SO SOME OF ARE HOSTILE STRIVE TO

03:57:29.202 --> 03:57:32.138 region:rollup2
MAKE UNFORTUNATE CHOICES. WHEN

03:57:30.903 --> 03:57:34.340 region:rollup2
THOSE TRACES ARE MADE.

03:57:32.138 --> 03:57:36.042 region:rollup2

BUT THEN OUR EMPLOYEES

03:57:38.411 --> 03:57:42.248 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT THEY NEED TO

03:57:40.279 --> 03:57:43.883 region:rollup2
THEN. FIND ANOTHER JOB

03:57:42.248 --> 03:57:44.984 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY WHILE WE ARE

03:57:43.883 --> 03:57:46.085 region:rollup2

03:57:53.292 --> 03:57:56.195 region:rollup2
ALLOW THE AGE YOU TO CONSIDER

03:57:54.761 --> 03:57:57.630 region:rollup2
ANY OF THAT OR GIVE THEM THE

03:57:56.195 --> 03:57:59.398 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THOUGHT SO

03:57:57.630 --> 03:58:00.266 region:rollup2
IF IT WERE TO BE DENIED THEN WE

03:57:59.398 --> 03:58:01.501 region:rollup2
WOULD BE.

03:58:00.266 --> 03:58:02.935 region:rollup2
LEFT IN A VERY DIFFICULT

03:58:01.501 --> 03:58:04.036 region:rollup2

ADDITION.

03:58:06.706 --> 03:58:09.041 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK I NEED YOUR MIND

03:58:08.207 --> 03:58:11.043 region:rollup2
ANYONE ON THE COMMITTEE BUT WE

03:58:09.041 --> 03:58:13.246 region:rollup2

PAIRS TO PLAY WELL BELOW COST.

03:58:13.246 --> 03:58:15.848 region:rollup2
SO SOME OF OUR HOSPITALS UP TO

03:58:14.347 --> 03:58:17.250 region:rollup2
CLOSE ARE OFTEN BECAUSE THEY'RE

03:58:15.848 --> 03:58:18.985 region:rollup2
FACING THE MYRIAD OF.

03:58:17.250 --> 03:58:20.620 region:rollup2

03:58:18.985 --> 03:58:22.722 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS I MIGHT HAVE TO MAKE

03:58:20.620 --> 03:58:24.657 region:rollup2
THE PAINFUL DECISION TO CLOSE SO

03:58:22.722 --> 03:58:26.125 region:rollup2
AS THEY OCCUR ALONG GAVE THE

03:58:24.657 --> 03:58:27.393 region:rollup2
DEADLINE UNDER THIS BILL WHERE.

CARLTON WITH THE CALIFORNIA

04:08:48.547 --> 04:08:51.617 region:rollup2
APARTMENT ASSOCIATION BUT ME

04:08:49.782 --> 04:08:54.019 region:rollup2
FIRST CLARIFY. WE HAVE NO

04:08:51.617 --> 04:08:56.021 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS CLARIFYING THE STATUTE

04:08:54.019 --> 04:08:57.823 region:rollup2
WE HAVE NO PROBLEMS ARE

04:08:56.021 --> 04:08:59.491 region:rollup2
REVERSING THE NARROW HOLDING UP

04:08:57.823 --> 04:09:01.093 region:rollup2
IN THE LOPEZ CASE. I THINK

04:08:59.491 --> 04:09:02.861 region:rollup2
THOUGH WE HAVE A DISAGREEMENT

04:09:01.093 --> 04:09:04.863 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW THE CURRENT STATUTE IS

04:09:02.861 --> 04:09:07.065 region:rollup2
WRITTEN WE HAVE A.

04:09:04.863 --> 04:09:09.501 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S WHEN THE

04:09:07.065 --> 04:09:12.371 region:rollup2
BUSINESS NEGOTIATES IN THE

04:09:09.501 --> 04:09:13.906 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE NOT WHEN THE CONSUMER

04:09:12.371 --> 04:09:15.674 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATES IN THE LANGUAGE.

04:09:13.906 --> 04:09:17.075 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE THIS HAPPEN ALL THE

04:09:15.674 --> 04:09:18.243 region:rollup2
TIME IN THE RENTAL HOUSING

04:09:17.075 --> 04:09:20.112 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY.

04:09:18.243 --> 04:09:21.980 region:rollup2
PARENTS COME.

04:09:20.112 --> 04:09:23.782 region:rollup2
TO RENT AN APARTMENT THEY BRING

04:09:21.980 --> 04:09:25.584 region:rollup2
THEIR CHILD WITH THEM.

04:09:23.782 --> 04:09:27.219 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THE WAY

04:09:25.584 --> 04:09:29.922 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IS READING THE

04:09:27.219 --> 04:09:31.290 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT LANGUAGE AS WRITTEN.

04:09:29.922 --> 04:09:32.591 region:rollup2
THE LANDLORD WILL NOW SAY I

04:09:31.290 --> 04:09:33.392 region:rollup2

04:09:32.591 --> 04:09:34.993 region:rollup2

HAPPENS TO BE A MINOR.

04:09:45.337 --> 04:09:48.874 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN

04:09:46.605 --> 04:09:50.075 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE.

04:09:48.874 --> 04:09:51.944 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS WITH GETTING PEOPLE

04:09:50.075 --> 04:09:53.679 region:rollup2
INTO HOUSING TODAY.

04:09:51.944 --> 04:09:55.814 region:rollup2
