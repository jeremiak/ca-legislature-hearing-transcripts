TYPE OF TAX AGENCY CONSOLIDATION

OF THAT SHOULD TAKE PLACE.

AND SINCE THEN THERE HAVE BEEN

00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:47.119
PROPOSALS LARGE AND SMALL.

00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:48.421
RANGING FROM CONSOLIDATING

00:09:48.487 --> 00:09:49.989

EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT

00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:58.164
DEPARTMENT INTO A SINGLE ENTITY.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.831
AND THAT'S YOUR COMMITTEE

00:09:58.898 --> 00:09:59.598
BACKGROUND --

00:09:59.665 --> 00:10:01.434
PAPER POINTS OUT LOW MORE THAN

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.535
EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO THE

00:10:02.601 --> 00:10:03.903
LEGISLATURE ENACTED ASSEMBLY

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.604
BILL ONE OH TO CREATING THE

00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:07.406
OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS OF THE OTA

00:10:07.473 --> 00:10:08.674
COMMONLY KNOWN.

00:10:08.741 --> 00:10:10.176
AS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TAX

00:10:10.242 --> 00:10:15.147
AND FEE ADMINISTRATION OR CD TFA.

00:10:15.214 --> 00:10:16.015
OF THE BILL MOVED EVERYTHING THE

00:10:16.082 --> 00:10:16.615
BOARD OF EQUALIZATION TO HAVE

00:10:16.682 --> 00:10:17.416
RESPONSIBILITY --

00:10:17.483 --> 00:10:18.651
FOR IN STATE STATUTES SO THOSE

00:10:18.718 --> 00:10:20.753
ABOUT 90% OF ITS OVERALL DUTIES

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.488
TO THESE TWO NEW AGENCIES. FOR

00:10:22.555 --> 00:10:24.457
THAT REALITY REALLY LEADS US TO

00:10:24.523 --> 00:10:25.858
QUESTIONS I BELIEVE.

00:10:25.925 --> 00:10:27.293
THE FIRST IS GIVEN WHAT THE

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.562
BOARD IS NOW --

00:10:29.628 --> 00:10:30.696
SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE AN ELECTED

00:10:30.763 --> 00:10:32.331
BOARD.

00:10:32.398 --> 00:10:33.899
AND IF THE ANSWER TO THAT IS NO

00:10:33.966 --> 00:10:35.501
THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IS WHAT

00:10:35.568 --> 00:10:37.103
IS THE BEST MOST TAXPAYER

00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:38.971
FRIENDLY AND RESPONSIVE WAY.

00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:40.840
THE MINISTER THE PROGRAMS THAT

00:10:40.906 --> 00:10:42.341
TODAY REMAIN UNDER THE BOARD'S

00:10:42.408 --> 00:10:45.277
UMBRELLA. FOR ME THE ANSWER THE

00:10:45.344 --> 00:10:46.712
FIRST QUESTION IS NO.

00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:48.247
THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION DOES

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:49.382
NOT NEED NOR SHOULD CONTINUE TO

00:10:49.448 --> 00:10:51.250
HAVE AN ELECTED BOARD AND I SAY

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:52.752
THIS WITH PHONE.

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:54.353
YOU'RE REALLY SOME --

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.921
SADNESS BECAUSE I HAD THE

00:10:55.988 --> 00:10:56.922
OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE ON THE

00:10:56.989 --> 00:10:58.190
BOARD AND I'M STILL CURRENTLY ON

00:10:58.257 --> 00:10:58.958
THE FIFTH VOTING MEMBER OF THE

00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:00.059
BOARD -- BUT

00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:01.594
THE BOARD HAS CHANGED OVER TIME

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.529
AND CERTAINLY NOW WITH THIS --

00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:04.964
LIMITED RESPONSIBILITIES OR

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:06.198
REDUCE RESPONSIBILITIES I DO

00:11:06.265 --> 00:11:08.501
BELIEVE THERE IS NO NEED FOR AN

00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:09.101
ELECTED BOARD.

00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:10.336
AND SO THE SECOND QUESTION IS

00:11:10.403 --> 00:11:11.937
AND WHAT IS THE BEST MOST --

00:11:12.004 --> 00:11:13.973
TAXPAYER RESPONSIVE AND FRIENDLY

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.207
WAY TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAMS

00:11:15.274 --> 00:11:16.175
THAT REMAIN TODAY UNDER THE

00:11:16.242 --> 00:11:18.144
BOARD'S UMBRELLA.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.245
THE FORTY NINE OTHER STATES

00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:20.546
MANAGE QUITE WELL WITHOUT

00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:22.148
ELECTED BOARDS AND I'M CONFIDENT

00:11:22.214 --> 00:11:24.183
THE CALIFORNIA CAN DO THE SAME.

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:24.750
OF THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND

00:11:24.817 --> 00:11:25.918
QUESTION --

00:11:25.985 --> 00:11:27.153
DOESN'T HAVE AN OBVIOUS ANSWER

00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:28.554
AND I THINK THAT'S FOR US TO

00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:29.989
SORT AS WE CONTINUE THESE

00:11:30.056 --> 00:11:31.357
CONVERSATIONS --

00:11:31.424 --> 00:11:33.125
WHICH MEANS THAT SO THERE'S

00:11:33.192 --> 00:11:34.794
REALLY NOT A WRONG WAY TO DO IT --

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:35.428
WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT THERE IS

00:11:35.494 --> 00:11:38.497
AN EXPERT IS A COMING UPON THE

00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:39.265
DUTIES THAT THE BORDER IS A

00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:40.866
UTILIZATION STILL?

00:11:40.933 --> 00:11:43.936
HAS AND I WANT JUST A TECHNOLOGY

00:11:44.003 --> 00:11:45.938
EXPERTISE AMONG THE STAFF WHO

00:11:46.005 --> 00:11:48.174
REALLY ARE THE OF THE LIAISON

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.108
WITH OUR OUR TAX PAYING

00:11:49.175 --> 00:11:50.776
COMMUNITY PARTICULARLY OUR OUR

00:11:50.843 --> 00:11:51.877
STATUS AS SEASON.

00:11:51.944 --> 00:11:53.979
AND I AM SURE THAT THE ASSESSORS

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:58.184
AND AND THE OF WHAT VEHICLE

00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:58.818
SECTION REPRESENTS WILL BECOME

00:11:58.884 --> 00:12:00.019
ANYMORE ABOUT THAT.

00:12:00.086 --> 00:12:02.021
AND UP SO BY THAT I MEAN A

00:12:02.088 --> 00:12:03.389
CREDIBLE CASE TO BE MADE TO

00:12:03.456 --> 00:12:04.824
LEAVE THE B. ALWAYS PROGRAMS

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:05.691
RIGHT WHERE THEY ARE JUST

00:12:05.758 --> 00:12:07.059
ELIMINATE THE ELECTED BOARD IN

00:12:07.126 --> 00:12:08.194
THE CONSTITUTION.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.762
OR YOU CAN MOVE ALL THE PROGRAMS

00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:11.464
TO SAY THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:12.898
OR YOU CAN MOVE THE MALL TO THE

00:12:12.965 --> 00:12:13.999
CITY TODAY --

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:15.067
OR YOU COULD SPLIT THE PROGRAMS

00:12:15.134 --> 00:12:16.402
BETWEEN AGENCIES BECAUSE THERE

00:12:16.469 --> 00:12:17.603
ARE SOME PROPERTY TAX PROGRAMS

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.473
THAT HAVE SPECIFIC POLICY OF

THEIR JOB UNDER THE STATUTE.

00:18:43.388 --> 00:18:46.391
I FELT THAT WE PASSED A LAW.

00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:48.594
WE WE PASS A LAW THAT GAVE THEM

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.928
THE RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKING

00:18:49.995 --> 00:18:51.463
THAT ADJUSTMENT.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:53.031
AND THEN THEY JUST DECIDED TO

00:18:53.098 --> 00:18:54.533
IGNORE WHAT WE PUT ON OUR

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.767
STATUTE.

00:18:55.834 --> 00:18:57.402
SO CAN YOU CAN YOU OR MAYBE

00:18:57.469 --> 00:18:59.505
COMMENT ON THAT SURE THANK YOU

00:18:59.571 --> 00:19:01.340

00:19:01.406 --> 00:19:02.407
AND I HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH YOU

00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:03.942
OF THE BOARD'S RESPONSIBILITY

00:19:04.009 --> 00:19:05.377
WAS REALLY EVERY YEAR TO DO

00:19:05.444 --> 00:19:06.612
THOSE SO CALLED TRUE UP.

00:19:06.678 --> 00:19:09.414
AN ODD TO BE SURE THAT OF THE

00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:10.516
ALL THE SPIRIT OF THE STATUTE

00:19:10.582 --> 00:19:12.117
WAS CARRIED OUT.

00:19:12.184 --> 00:19:13.819
ON NOT TO LEGISLATE THE OF THE

00:19:13.886 --> 00:19:15.220
DEGREE OF THE DEATH GOT SACKS

00:19:15.287 --> 00:19:20.726
INCREASE AND AND I WAS A NO VOTE

00:19:20.792 --> 00:19:23.462
I SUPPORT THE STAFF HAS

00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:25.197
PETITIONED FUNDS LOST SO WE'RE

00:19:25.264 --> 00:19:25.831
IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

00:19:25.898 --> 00:19:26.932
DOLLARS.

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:28.667
AND WE CAN ILL AFFORD TO HEAR

00:19:28.734 --> 00:19:30.802
REALLY LOSE OF THOSE DOLLARS --

00:19:30.869 --> 00:19:32.538
FROM TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS --

00:19:32.604 --> 00:19:34.106
BUT IT WAS --

00:19:34.172 --> 00:19:36.208
AT AND I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE

00:19:36.275 --> 00:19:38.710
PRIOR BOARD WHO VOTED ON THE SUN

00:19:38.777 --> 00:19:39.578
TERMS OF WHAT THE MOTIVATION WAS

00:19:39.645 --> 00:19:41.747
BUT I'M SURE GIVEN THE

00:19:41.813 --> 00:19:44.116
ROBUSTNESS OF THE CONVERSATION --

00:19:44.182 --> 00:19:45.551
THAT DID TAKE PLACE --

00:19:45.617 --> 00:19:46.585
THINK THERE WERE THERE WAS A

00:19:46.652 --> 00:19:47.185
FEELING THAT THERE WAS SOME

00:19:47.252 --> 00:19:48.253
EXPOSURES THAT --

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.755
WE WERE INCREASING GAS TAXES

00:19:49.821 --> 00:19:51.890
WHEN IN FACT IT WAS A MECHANISM

00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:52.424
THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAD A

00:19:52.491 --> 00:19:53.358
ACTIVE THAT --

00:19:53.425 --> 00:19:55.360
REALLY JUST PLACED IN OUR HANDS

00:19:55.427 --> 00:19:59.031
THE AS YOU SAY OF THE INSURING

00:19:59.097 --> 00:19:59.631
THE REVENUE NEUTRALITY AND THE

00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:03.869
TRIP THAT WE WOMAN I WOULD LIKE

00:20:03.936 --> 00:20:06.104
TO FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH

00:20:06.171 --> 00:20:07.406
REVENUE.

00:20:07.472 --> 00:20:08.941
WAS LOST TO THE STATE OF

00:20:09.007 --> 00:20:10.342
CALIFORNIA WE CAN WE CAN GET BY

00:20:10.409 --> 00:20:12.811
THIS INAPPROPRIATE ACTION OF THE

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:14.012
BOARD OF EQUALIZATION.

00:20:14.079 --> 00:20:15.414
AND IF IT IS ON THE HUNDREDS OF

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.583
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF COURSE I

00:20:17.649 --> 00:20:18.750
DON'T BELIEVE WE CAN RECOVER

00:20:18.817 --> 00:20:20.852
THAT AT ALL.

00:20:20.919 --> 00:20:22.254
THERE'S NO WAY IT'S JUST.

00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:23.455
LOST --

00:20:23.522 --> 00:20:25.724
REVENUE AND THEN WHAT THE IMPACT

00:20:25.791 --> 00:20:27.659
OF THAT REVENUE LOSS WAS BECAUSE

00:20:27.726 --> 00:20:30.062
THOSE FUNDS WERE FOR ROAD

00:20:30.128 --> 00:20:32.230
REPAIRS --

00:20:32.297 --> 00:20:34.299
AND THE MONEY WOULD GO TO ROAD

00:20:34.366 --> 00:20:35.601
REPAIRS --

00:20:35.667 --> 00:20:36.935
THERE WERE ABOUT AND WE'RE WE

00:20:37.002 --> 00:20:40.572
HAD THIS HUGE ROW REPAIR BACKLOG.

00:20:40.639 --> 00:20:43.408
AND THAT'S WHY WE PAST SP.

00:20:43.475 --> 00:20:46.345
ONE AND I THINK THAT --

00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:48.380
THIS IS.

00:20:48.447 --> 00:20:52.351
AN EXAMPLE OF A PROBLEM WITH THE

00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:54.519
BORDER LEGALIZATION --

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:55.921
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE

00:20:55.988 --> 00:20:57.856
RESEARCH DONE ON WHAT THE

00:20:57.923 --> 00:20:59.458
REVENUE LOSS WOULD BE A SORT OF

00:20:59.524 --> 00:21:00.759
BILL WHAT I WILL DO.

00:21:00.826 --> 00:21:02.494
LET ME GET YOU THE EXACT

00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:04.196
MAGNITUDE OF THE DOLLAR LOSS I

00:21:04.262 --> 00:21:05.998
THINK WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPACT

00:21:06.064 --> 00:21:08.033
ON OUR PROJECTS OF THE

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.434
CALIFORNIANS PETITION COMMISSION

00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:10.569
AND OTHERS MIGHT BE.

00:21:10.636 --> 00:21:12.137
BETTER INFORMED ON THAT THAT WE

00:21:12.204 --> 00:21:13.538
CAN COORDINATE WITH THEM AS WELL.

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:15.073
OF AND WHAT WHAT I WOULD JUST

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.008
SAY THAT YOU KNOW THE ROLE OF

00:21:16.074 --> 00:21:18.176
THE BOARD IS REALLY TO APPLY THE

00:21:18.243 --> 00:21:20.479
LAW. TO APPLY THE LAW OF WE'RE

00:21:20.545 --> 00:21:23.281
NOT LEGISLATORS WE IMPLEMENTED A

00:21:23.348 --> 00:21:25.550
A WHAT ALL OF YOU AN ACT AND

00:21:25.617 --> 00:21:27.119
WERE THERE TO APPLY THE LAW AND

00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:27.719
I THINK --

00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:30.489
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE MY NOBLE

00:21:30.555 --> 00:21:31.089
INDICATED THAT IT WAS AN OVER

00:21:31.156 --> 00:21:32.324
REACH.

00:21:32.391 --> 00:21:35.260
BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW MUCH --

00:21:35.327 --> 00:21:36.595
ROAD REPAIRS.

00:21:36.662 --> 00:21:38.230
AND SAFETY PROJECTS WERE SET

00:21:38.296 --> 00:21:40.098
BACK.

00:21:40.165 --> 00:21:41.967
DO THAT LOST REVENUE AND I THINK

00:21:42.034 --> 00:21:44.469
THE THE CONSEQUENCE OF IT IS.

00:21:44.536 --> 00:21:46.471
WAS VERY BIG IN TERMS OF THE

00:21:46.538 --> 00:21:48.607
ROAD REPAIRS THAT WERE NOT ABLE

00:21:48.674 --> 00:21:49.975

OF YOU MENTION.

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:06.258
MANY OF THE IN YOUR OPINION MANY

00:22:06.324 --> 00:22:08.760
OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES COULD BE

00:22:08.827 --> 00:22:10.162
MOVED ELSEWHERE.

00:22:10.228 --> 00:22:12.664
IN STATE GOVERNMENT.

00:22:12.731 --> 00:22:14.332
OF COULD YOU DIG IN.

00:22:14.399 --> 00:22:16.001
A LITTLE BIT DEEPER INTO THAT

00:22:16.068 --> 00:22:17.335
AND WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT THAT'S

00:22:17.402 --> 00:22:18.470
ONE QUESTION [inaudible]

00:22:18.537 --> 00:22:23.075
OF HOW DOES THE NEW STRUCTURE.

00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:25.177
IMPROVE OVERSIGHT OF AND

00:22:25.243 --> 00:22:26.778
ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:28.113
OF THE FUNCTIONS OF THE TWO NEW

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.282
DEPARTMENTS.

OF AND THE THIRD IS YOU HAVE AN

00:22:33.518 --> 00:22:34.920
OPINION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

THIS BOARD THE BILL WE SHOULD BE

00:22:36.822 --> 00:22:37.823
AN ELECTED.

00:22:37.889 --> 00:22:39.091
POSITION --

00:22:39.157 --> 00:22:41.560
CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY YOU THINK OR

00:22:41.626 --> 00:22:44.062
A WE'RE BETTER OFF WITH IT NOT

00:22:44.129 --> 00:22:46.364
BEING AN ELECTED POSITION SURE

00:22:46.431 --> 00:22:46.965
SURE -- LET

00:22:47.032 --> 00:22:48.066
ME SEE THIS MAYBE START WITH THE

00:22:48.133 --> 00:22:50.602
LAST QUESTION FIRST --

00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:51.169
CALIFORNIA REMAINS THE ONLY

00:22:51.236 --> 00:22:53.805
STATE -- ALL

00:22:53.872 --> 00:22:56.475
OTHER FORTY NINE STATES ARE ABLE --

00:22:56.541 --> 00:22:58.009
TO REALLY CARRY OUT THESE DUTIES --

00:22:58.076 --> 00:22:59.111
ADMINISTRATIVELY.

00:22:59.177 --> 00:23:01.046
OF THEIR VERY VERY STRUCTURES

00:23:01.113 --> 00:23:03.682
FOR HOW THESE PROGRAMS ARE A

00:23:03.749 --> 00:23:05.150
MISTER WITHIN THE OTHER FORTY

00:23:05.217 --> 00:23:07.085
NINE STATES WHAT I'M SUGGESTING

00:23:07.152 --> 00:23:08.687
HERE IF A MANAGER WOMAN IS OUT

00:23:08.754 --> 00:23:10.122
OF CALIFORNIA CAN FOLLOW SUIT.

00:23:10.188 --> 00:23:11.356
OBVIOUSLY THE EXPERTISE LIES

00:23:11.423 --> 00:23:13.892
WITH THE STUFF ANDWE CAN REALLY

00:23:13.959 --> 00:23:15.260
HOW'S THE STUFF ANYWHERE COULD

00:23:15.327 --> 00:23:16.628
BE IS EVEN A NEW STANDALONE.

00:23:16.695 --> 00:23:18.663
OF SMALL DEPARTMENT IF YOU

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:19.931
WANTED IT THAT WAY NO NEED FOR

00:23:19.998 --> 00:23:24.236
AN ELECTED BOARD HIM BUT IT OVER-MY TIME OF SERVING ON THE BOARD.

00:23:24.302 --> 00:23:26.872
OF CERTAINLY HAD A FULL WORKLOAD

00:23:26.938 --> 00:23:27.939
WHEN I SERVED ON THE BOARD WE

00:23:28.006 --> 00:23:29.574
HAVE THE THE APPELLATE FUNCTIONS.

00:23:29.641 --> 00:23:30.509
WE WERE A FULL TIME WORKING

00:23:30.575 --> 00:23:31.243
BOARD.

00:23:31.309 --> 00:23:38.316
OF AND EVEN OVER STARTING --

00:23:38.383 --> 00:23:40.085
TO DIMINISHED A BIT MANY MORE

00:23:40.152 --> 00:23:40.719
CASES WERE GOING TO SETTLEMENTS

00:23:40.786 --> 00:23:43.188
AND AND TODAY OBVIOUSLY THERE IS

00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:44.823
NO PUBLIC FUNCTIONS ON OTHER

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:46.825
THAN OUR PROPERTY TAX APPEALS

00:23:46.892 --> 00:23:47.793
FOR STATUS AS THESE BEFORE THE

00:23:47.859 --> 00:23:49.227
BOARD OF EQUALIZATION.

00:23:49.294 --> 00:23:50.128
SO I THINK THOSE OF FUNCTIONS

00:23:50.195 --> 00:23:51.329
CAN BE HOUSE ELSEWHERE THE

00:23:51.396 --> 00:23:52.731
GUIDANCE ASSESSORS AND YOU'LL

00:23:52.798 --> 00:23:53.765
HEAR FROM SOME THE ASSESSORS

00:23:53.832 --> 00:23:55.133
TODAY IS IMPORTANT.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.102
BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL OF FUNK --

00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:57.869
PURPOSE OF THE BOARD OF

00:23:57.936 --> 00:23:59.171
EQUALIZATION ESTABLISHING THE

00:23:59.237 --> 00:24:00.338
CONSTITUTION WAS INSURE

00:24:00.405 --> 00:24:02.340
UNIFORMITY ACROSS COUNTY LINES

00:24:02.407 --> 00:24:05.243
IN TERMS OF OF PROPERTY TAXATION

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:06.144
ASSESSMENTS.

00:24:06.211 --> 00:24:10.081
AND WHAT I BEGAN TO SEE OF IS

00:24:10.148 --> 00:24:12.217
REALLY OF REALLY MOVING AWAY

00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:14.419
FROM THAT UNIFORMITY THAT --

00:24:14.486 --> 00:24:17.556
IN TERMS OF HOW TESTERS WERE

00:24:17.622 --> 00:24:22.994
BEING SERVED AND SOME GETTING

00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:24.563
THE SOME THESE PROGRAMS --

00:24:24.629 --> 00:24:26.031
ON THE GROUND FOR TAXPAYERS IN

00:24:26.097 --> 00:24:27.098
OTHER DISTRICTS THAT WERE MORE

00:24:27.165 --> 00:24:28.533
ROBUST AND DOING SO SO I THINK

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.301
HAVING.

00:24:29.367 --> 00:24:30.335
EVERYTHING UNDER A SINGLE

00:24:30.402 --> 00:24:31.770
UMBRELLA A SINGLE ADMINISTRATION

00:24:31.837 --> 00:24:33.104
JUST ENSURE THAT ALL TAXPAYERS

00:24:33.171 --> 00:24:35.740
HAVE ACCESS TO SIMILAR RESOURCES

00:24:35.807 --> 00:24:37.209
CAN BE SERVED EQUALLY.

00:24:37.275 --> 00:24:38.043
AND CERTAINLY WITH RESPECT TO

00:24:38.109 --> 00:24:40.178
PROPERTY TAX ON THE GUIDANCE --

00:24:40.245 --> 00:24:41.746
TO ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES THAT

00:24:41.813 --> 00:24:42.714
IS PART OF THE OVERSIGHT

00:24:42.781 --> 00:24:44.182
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE BOARD OF

00:24:44.249 --> 00:24:44.816
EQUALIZATION FOR COUNTY ASSESS

00:24:44.883 --> 00:24:45.784
PROPERTIES.

00:24:45.851 --> 00:24:47.586
IS A REALLY IMPORTANT --

00:24:47.652 --> 00:24:48.987
AND THAT GUIDES REALLY CAN COME

00:24:49.054 --> 00:24:50.388
FROM THE EXPERTS HOUSE ANYWHERE

00:24:50.455 --> 00:24:51.590
IN STATE GOVERNMENT.

00:24:51.656 --> 00:24:53.191
SO I THINK IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE

00:24:53.258 --> 00:24:55.393
FUNCTIONS IT'S ABOUT --

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.562
HOW WE BEST SERVE TAXPAYERS OF I

00:24:57.629 --> 00:24:59.064
KNOW THE ELECTED MEMBERS BELIEVE

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:00.665
THAT THEY ARE CONDUITS FOR THEIR

00:25:00.732 --> 00:25:02.033
CONSTITUENTS TO COME?

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.902
AND I HAVE THEIR ISSUES --

00:25:03.969 --> 00:25:07.072
RESULTS OF FRANKLY IF WE HAVE A

00:25:07.138 --> 00:25:08.273
HUNDRED TWENTY LEGISLATORS THAT

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.242
ALSO CAN BE CONDUITS FOR THAT.

00:25:10.308 --> 00:25:14.045
AND IT'S JUST TO ME --

00:25:14.112 --> 00:25:16.448
BUT ADDED IT'S USEFUL PURPOSE

00:25:16.514 --> 00:25:19.851
ANYMORE.

00:25:19.918 --> 00:25:21.419
COULD YOU TELL IN SUCH A SHORT

00:25:21.486 --> 00:25:23.388
PERIOD OF TIME SINCE THE CHANGES

00:25:23.455 --> 00:25:24.990
WERE MADE US WITH THE

00:25:25.056 --> 00:25:26.725
DIFFERENCES ARE.

00:25:26.791 --> 00:25:28.059
YEAH I KNOW IT'S A VERY SHORT IT

00:25:28.126 --> 00:25:29.327
IS A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND I

00:25:29.394 --> 00:25:30.428
DON'T WANT TO BE UNFAIR WITH

00:25:30.495 --> 00:25:31.930
RESPECT TO THE ASSESSMENT LOOK

00:25:31.997 --> 00:25:34.199
ANY REORGANIZATION OF THIS

00:25:34.266 --> 00:25:35.867
MAGNITUDE IS GOING TO TAKE TIME.

00:25:35.934 --> 00:25:38.136
AND SURE THERE BEEN ROCKY STARTS

00:25:38.203 --> 00:25:40.772
AND AND BUT I DO THINK THAT BOTH

00:25:40.839 --> 00:25:42.841
THE DEPARTMENT STILL CD TFA AND

00:25:42.908 --> 00:25:44.809
NO T. A. AND AND A MENTOR WILL

00:25:44.876 --> 00:25:46.411
YOU WILL HAVE A LOTS OF

00:25:46.478 --> 00:25:47.812
OPPORTUNITIES --

00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:49.414
TO A REALLY DO A DEEP DIVE ON

00:25:49.481 --> 00:25:50.181
THIS --

00:25:50.248 --> 00:25:51.116
DURING YOUR SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS

00:25:51.182 --> 00:25:54.052
BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT --

00:25:54.119 --> 00:25:54.686
YOU KNOW ITS --

00:25:54.753 --> 00:25:59.557
SETTLING IN OKAY AS NOW HEARING

00:25:59.624 --> 00:26:02.394
REGULAR CASELOADS AND THEY'LL

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:05.430
PROBABLY RAMP UP AS CASES OR WE

00:26:05.497 --> 00:26:06.831
HAVE JUST BEEN AMORE CASES ARE

00:26:06.898 --> 00:26:09.234
BEING PREPARED OF FOR A HEARING --

00:26:09.301 --> 00:26:13.371
TA ACIDITY FAA OF I THINK IT WAS --

00:26:13.438 --> 00:26:14.773
TOUGH FOR THESE --

00:26:14.839 --> 00:26:16.608
STUFF -- TO

00:26:16.675 --> 00:26:18.710
LOOK AT BEGINNING --

00:26:18.777 --> 00:26:20.712
IN A NEW ORGANIZATION THAT --

00:26:20.779 --> 00:26:23.148
DIDN'T HAVE ELECTED DIDN'T HAVE

00:26:23.214 --> 00:26:23.648
AN ELECTED BOARD.

00:26:23.715 --> 00:26:26.017
OF AND I THINK PART OF THAT WAS

00:26:26.084 --> 00:26:29.454
BECAUSE WE DON'T WE THEY JUST

00:26:29.521 --> 00:26:32.290
FELT LIKE THAT LISTEN.

00:26:32.357 --> 00:26:33.391
I DON'T WANT TO EVEN GET INTO

00:26:33.458 --> 00:26:34.359
THAT IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENED

00:26:34.426 --> 00:26:35.660
IN THE PAST BONES A LOT OF

00:26:35.727 --> 00:26:36.561
THAT'S BEEN DOCUMENTED AND

00:26:36.628 --> 00:26:38.897
REPORTS AND AND ON A SORT OF

00:26:38.964 --> 00:26:39.164
BEEN DONE.

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:41.566
BUT BUT I THINK THE NEW

00:26:41.633 --> 00:26:42.567
DEPARTMENT CERTAINLY SELLING AND

00:26:42.634 --> 00:26:44.169
I THINK THAT AS YOU BEGIN TO

00:26:44.235 --> 00:26:45.470
LOOK AT THE VARIOUS --

00:26:45.537 --> 00:26:46.571
TAX AND FEE PROGRAMS ARE BEING

00:26:46.638 --> 00:26:47.072
ADMINISTERED BY THE NEW

00:26:47.138 --> 00:26:49.441
DEPARTMENT OF THEY ARE ALL WELL

00:26:49.507 --> 00:26:51.710
STUFF THEY ARE BEING RESPONSIVE --

00:26:51.776 --> 00:26:53.378
THE OUT REACHES US STARTING TO

00:26:53.445 --> 00:26:54.913
BECOME MORE ROBUST AND SO IT

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.114
JUST TAKES TIME.

00:26:56.181 --> 00:26:58.316
OF IT'S DIFFICULT TO MOVE ON IT

00:26:58.383 --> 00:26:59.617
JUST THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES

00:26:59.684 --> 00:27:00.852
ACROSS SOME --

00:27:00.919 --> 00:27:02.620
DEPARTMENTS AT ORGANIZATIONS AND

00:27:02.687 --> 00:27:03.621
STATE GOVERNMENT AND HOPE THAT

00:27:03.688 --> 00:27:05.190
IT BEGINS TO DO ITS JOB

00:27:05.256 --> 00:27:06.157
OVERNIGHT --

00:27:06.224 --> 00:27:08.626
BUT I EASE OF STAND BY LIFE

00:27:08.693 --> 00:27:10.462
SUPPORT OF A B. ONE OH TWO LAST

00:27:10.528 --> 00:27:11.963
YEAR AND AND CENTER NIELSEN.

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.298
OF I JUST WANNA MAKE A COMMENT

00:27:13.365 --> 00:27:19.304
ABOUT THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL

00:27:19.371 --> 00:27:19.971

00:27:20.038 --> 00:27:20.772
POINT WELL TAKEN TERMS OF A

00:27:20.839 --> 00:27:22.574
MAJOR MAJOR POLICY INITIATIVE

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.508
AND CERTAINLY REORGANIZATION --

00:27:23.575 --> 00:27:24.142
TAKING PLACE IN A BUDGET TRAILER

00:27:24.209 --> 00:27:24.976
BILL I WILL SAY THOUGH THAT --

00:27:25.043 --> 00:27:26.578
SET ITSELF FOR A LEADING UP TO

00:27:26.644 --> 00:27:27.946
THAT TRAILER BILL.

00:27:28.013 --> 00:27:29.748
FOR MANY MANY YEARS UP TO THAT

00:27:29.814 --> 00:27:31.683
POINT HAD REALLY BEGUN --

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:33.518
TO YOU KNOW REALLY DIG DEEP IN

00:27:33.585 --> 00:27:34.786
TERMS OF SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT.

00:27:34.853 --> 00:27:36.621
GAVE RISE TO A BE ONE OR TWO AND

00:27:36.688 --> 00:27:41.026
SO I DID AND THE AND A LOT OF

00:27:41.092 --> 00:27:42.327
OVERSIGHT THAT HAD BEEN DONE

00:27:42.394 --> 00:27:43.995
LEADING UP TO THAT POINT AND I

00:27:44.062 --> 00:27:45.230

THINK THAT --

00:27:47.132 --> 00:27:48.333
THAT WAS ALREADY KNOWN.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.300
OF THAT --

00:27:49.367 --> 00:27:50.935
THAT I THINK THIS IS GOING TO

00:27:51.002 --> 00:27:52.237
CONTINUE TO TAKE TIME AND WILL

00:27:52.303 --> 00:27:53.571
CONTINUE TO IMPROVE.

US SENATOR ALSO WHEN YOU HAVE

00:27:54.906 --> 00:27:56.241

00:27:56.307 --> 00:27:57.475
BOTH DEPARTMENTS WILL.

00:27:57.542 --> 00:27:59.577
BE VERY FAIR AND ABOUT THEIR

00:27:59.644 --> 00:28:00.345
SUSSMAN ABOUT WHERE THEY ARE

00:28:00.412 --> 00:28:01.479
TODAY -- BUT

00:28:01.546 --> 00:28:05.183
ALSO ARE VERY VERY --

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:05.717
EAGER TO THE KITCHEN TO DO

00:28:05.784 --> 00:28:08.720
BETTER.

00:28:08.787 --> 00:28:10.789
WHAT IS YOUR YOUR RELATIONSHIP

00:28:10.855 --> 00:28:13.858
NOW WITH THE TWO NEW DEPARTMENTS --

00:28:13.925 --> 00:28:15.393
WHAT WHAT IS THE CONNECTION OR

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:17.862
RELATIONSHIP AND YES HAS THAT

00:28:17.929 --> 00:28:19.964
BEEN REALLY FIGURE IT OUT?

00:28:20.031 --> 00:28:21.766
OR IS THAT CHANGING WHAT.

00:28:21.833 --> 00:28:25.403
OF TWO NEW DEPARTMENTS AS OF

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:26.237
NONE.

00:28:26.304 --> 00:28:28.773
OF THESE ARE EXACTLY BRANCH OF

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.475

ORGANIZATIONS OF I THINK IT'S

00:28:49.027 --> 00:28:49.394
WISE NOT TO HAVE ANY

00:28:49.461 --> 00:28:50.261
RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM.

00:28:50.328 --> 00:28:51.463

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.915
THIS YEAR IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

I'M SERVING IN MY THIRTEENTH

00:29:19.958 --> 00:29:21.726
YEAR AND THE LEGISLATURE IN ONE

00:29:21.793 --> 00:29:23.661
OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE ALWAYS

00:29:23.728 --> 00:29:25.196
STRUGGLED WITH HIS THAT.

00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:26.898
CALIFORNIANS HAVE PASSED MORE

00:29:26.965 --> 00:29:28.266
THAN SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS

00:29:28.333 --> 00:29:29.901
WORTH OF BEHIND MEASURES AND THE

00:29:29.968 --> 00:29:31.336
TIME THAT I'VE BEEN HERE.

00:29:31.402 --> 00:29:33.171
ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT

00:29:33.238 --> 00:29:34.005
BILLION IN LOCAL SCHOOL MY

00:29:34.072 --> 00:29:35.573
MEASURES BUT YET THERE'S LITTLE

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.209
ACCOUNTABILITY AND IT SEEMS THAT

00:29:38.276 --> 00:29:40.578
IN THE LEGISLATURE WE WILL LOOK

00:29:40.645 --> 00:29:41.279
AT SOMETHING WHEN THERE'S A

00:29:41.346 --> 00:29:42.113
PROBLEM.

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.182
AND THEN WE ARE OFF TO THE NEXT

00:29:44.249 --> 00:29:46.584
CRISIS OR A CRITICAL THING THAT

00:29:46.651 --> 00:29:48.319
THE LEGISLATURE HAS TO DEAL WITH.

00:29:48.386 --> 00:29:49.787
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S

00:29:49.854 --> 00:29:51.823
A REAL OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR THE

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:54.959
LEGISLATURE. TO DESIGNATE SOME

00:29:55.026 --> 00:29:59.964
SPECIFIC STATION TO COMPLEMENT

00:30:00.031 --> 00:30:01.499
WHAT WE DO IN THE LEGISLATURE

00:30:01.566 --> 00:30:03.301
AND ASSIST US WITH THE BOND

00:30:03.368 --> 00:30:05.837
ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT.

00:30:05.904 --> 00:30:07.705
AND PARTICULARLY --

00:30:07.772 --> 00:30:08.873
TO GIVE THE PUBLIC AN

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.708
OPPORTUNITY TO BE PRESENT AT

00:30:10.775 --> 00:30:12.377
PUBLIC HEARINGS THAT THEY HAVE

00:30:12.443 --> 00:30:14.312
AN UNDERSTANDING THAT WE AS A

00:30:14.379 --> 00:30:17.482
BODY AND THE THE STATE ELECTED.

00:30:17.549 --> 00:30:19.651
AS A WHOLE ARE REALLY TAKING

00:30:19.717 --> 00:30:21.920
SERIOUSLY OUR JOB AS BEING GOOD

00:30:21.986 --> 00:30:24.889
CUSTODIANS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS

00:30:24.956 --> 00:30:28.193
AND IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE

00:30:28.259 --> 00:30:29.761
HAVE PASSED --

00:30:29.827 --> 00:30:32.163
NUMBER OF WATER BEHIND MEASURES

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:33.932
THERE ARE ELEVEN DIFFERENT WATER

00:30:33.998 --> 00:30:35.667
FINANCING COMMITTEES THAT ARE

00:30:35.733 --> 00:30:37.435
STILL IN PLACE YEAH AND I

00:30:37.502 --> 00:30:38.636
BELIEVE THAT THERE'S AN

00:30:38.703 --> 00:30:40.371
OPPORTUNITY TO REPURPOSE SOME OF

00:30:40.438 --> 00:30:41.973
THE REMAINING FRIENDS.

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.208
THAT ARE SITTING IN SOME OF

00:30:43.274 --> 00:30:43.841
THOSE COMMITTEES THAT HAVE BEEN

00:30:43.908 --> 00:30:45.810
IN USE THIS YEAR THE LEGISLATURE

00:30:45.877 --> 00:30:47.011
IS THINKING ABOUT IMPOSING A

00:30:47.078 --> 00:30:48.746
WATER TAXI FOR SAFE.

00:30:48.813 --> 00:30:49.814
AND CLEAN DRINKING WATER

00:30:49.881 --> 00:30:50.982
PARTICULARLY IN SOME OF THE

00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:52.417
CENTRAL VALLEY COUNTIES --

00:30:52.483 --> 00:30:54.185
BUT YET I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS

00:30:54.252 --> 00:30:55.420
STILL REMAINING MONEY THAT WE

00:30:55.486 --> 00:30:57.722
CAN RE PURPOSE BUT WE DON'T KNOW.

00:30:57.789 --> 00:30:59.657
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK

00:30:59.724 --> 00:31:02.360
THE BOARD TO LOOK AT SOME OF

00:31:02.427 --> 00:31:03.895
THOSE PARTS OF MONIES DO IT

00:31:03.962 --> 00:31:05.563
PUBLICLY REPORT BACK TO THE

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:06.898
LEGISLATURE.

00:31:06.965 --> 00:31:08.967
AND I'M DOING A BILL ON TO THAT

00:31:09.033 --> 00:31:11.069
END TO INCLUDE THAT IS SOMETHING

00:31:11.135 --> 00:31:12.570
THAT WE CAN LOOK AT FOR RE

00:31:12.637 --> 00:31:14.472
MODERNIZING THE PURPOSE OF THE

00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:15.306
B. ELLIE.

00:31:15.373 --> 00:31:16.741
AND I'M HOPING THAT THAT'S

00:31:16.808 --> 00:31:18.042
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN LOOK AT

00:31:18.109 --> 00:31:19.744
TOGETHER AND THAT WE CAN DISCUSS

00:31:19.811 --> 00:31:21.546
AND I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF

00:31:21.613 --> 00:31:23.281
EXPERIENCE WITH --

00:31:23.348 --> 00:31:24.816
OVER SIDE OF THE BOND MEASURES

00:31:24.882 --> 00:31:27.151
AS WELL AND AND PERHAPS WE CAN

00:31:27.218 --> 00:31:29.354
ENTERTAIN THAT IDEA WHILE WE

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:30.788
WHILE WE CONSIDER.

00:31:30.855 --> 00:31:37.328
GETTING RID OF THE B. O. E. ALL

00:31:37.395 --> 00:31:39.297
TOGETHER I AND REPURPOSE IT TO

00:31:39.364 --> 00:31:41.633
HAVE IT ASSISTING COMPLEMENT THE

00:31:41.699 --> 00:31:44.369

00:31:50.241 --> 00:31:51.309
TO LOOKING AT HOW WE DO

00:31:51.376 --> 00:31:52.577
MODERNIZE SOME OF THESE --

FIRST QUESTION FIRST A LITTLE

00:34:45.149 --> 00:34:46.717
BIT OF AN AWKWARD QUESTION BUT

00:34:46.784 --> 00:34:48.486
LET ME TRY TO PHRASE IT THIS WAY

00:34:48.553 --> 00:34:50.922
OF MANY OF YOU KNOW I'M A

00:34:50.988 --> 00:34:52.390

00:34:59.831 --> 00:35:01.132
VASTLY UNDERPAID OF SEVEN

00:35:01.199 --> 00:35:02.700
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

AND OTHER DAYS I DON'T THINK

00:35:03.468 --> 00:35:04.469
HE'S WORTH THE MAJOR LEAGUE

00:35:04.535 --> 00:35:06.070
MINIMUM SALARIES SO CLEARLY I'M

00:35:06.137 --> 00:35:07.839
NOT IN THE CELL RESETTING

00:35:07.905 --> 00:35:08.372

00:38:17.361 --> 00:38:17.495
WELL.

00:38:17.561 --> 00:38:19.363
AND I KNOW THAT WHAT GIVES ME

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:20.798
CONFIDENCE WHEN WE DO IT IS THAT

00:38:20.865 --> 00:38:22.533
WHEN WE DO WE FOR MANY OF THESE

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:23.601
MATTERS TO THE BROTHERS TO THE

00:38:23.668 --> 00:38:25.636
TAXPAYER OF ADVOCATES OFFICE IN

00:38:25.703 --> 00:38:27.238
EACH OF OUR TAX AGENCIES OR TO

00:38:27.304 --> 00:38:28.839
THE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS WITH EACH

00:38:28.906 --> 00:38:29.407
AND WITHIN EACH OF THE TAX.

00:38:29.473 --> 00:38:31.275
AGENCY'S THAT'S THE RESPONSE

00:38:31.342 --> 00:38:33.110
BACK TO TAXPAYERS WILL BE

00:38:33.177 --> 00:38:35.913
UNIFORM FROM ONE DOCTOR TO

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:36.914
ANOTHER.

00:38:36.981 --> 00:38:37.915
AND THE I'M NOT SO SURE THAT WE

00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:39.583
GET THAT WITH AN ELECTED BOARD

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:40.618
OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION

00:38:40.685 --> 00:38:41.519
BECAUSE THEY EACH HAVE DIFFERENT

00:38:41.585 --> 00:38:42.420
WAYS.

00:38:42.486 --> 00:38:43.821
OF INTERACTING WITH THEIR A

00:38:43.888 --> 00:38:46.023
CONSTITUENCY ALSO JUST --

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:47.725
SAY THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE

00:38:47.792 --> 00:38:48.292
TAXPAYERS THAT WE'RE TALKING

00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:49.760
ABOUT WITH WITH WITH REGARD TO

00:38:49.827 --> 00:38:51.295
THE CURRENT DUTIES OF THE BOARD

00:38:51.362 --> 00:38:51.929
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STATE

00:38:51.996 --> 00:38:52.997
ASSESSES.

00:38:53.064 --> 00:38:53.798
THESE ARE SOPHISTICATED

00:38:53.864 --> 00:38:55.399
TAXPAYERS PUBLIC UTILITIES

00:38:55.466 --> 00:38:56.867
RAILROADS --

00:38:56.934 --> 00:38:58.469
THE OTHER STILL IS OVERSIGHT

00:38:58.536 --> 00:39:00.171
OVER -- THE

00:39:00.237 --> 00:39:01.539
GAS TAX --

00:39:01.605 --> 00:39:02.973
BUT THESE ARE.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.376
TAXPAYERS WHO DO BUSINESS WITH

00:39:05.443 --> 00:39:08.813
THE STATE WHAT WILL NEED TO BE

00:39:08.879 --> 00:39:10.614
CLEAR WITH ANY KND OF CHANGES

00:39:10.681 --> 00:39:12.016
WHO ARE THEY DOING BUSINESS WITH.

00:39:12.083 --> 00:39:13.317
AND WHAT ARE THE EXPECTATIONS OF

00:39:13.384 --> 00:39:14.819
THE RELATIONSHIP OF THAT ENTITY

00:39:14.885 --> 00:39:16.020
WITH THE TAX PAYER.

00:39:16.087 --> 00:39:17.221
AND THAT COULD BE DEFINED AND

00:39:17.288 --> 00:39:18.522
CERTAINLY HAS A SO THE ONGOING

00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:19.724
OVERSIGHT OF THAT NEEDS TO

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:20.958
CONTINUE TO BE ROBUST.

00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:22.893
BUT IT IS UNIFORMLY TO BE AS

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.995
IMPORTANT OF A TAXPAYER SHOULD

00:39:25.062 --> 00:39:26.163
NOT --

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:27.898
EXPECT THAT BY VIRTUE OF THE

00:39:27.965 --> 00:39:28.699
WHO'S REPRESENTING THEM WHETHER

00:39:28.766 --> 00:39:30.701
IT BE ANY OF US AS LEGISLATORS

00:39:30.768 --> 00:39:32.670
OR OR ESTATE MY CONSTITUTIONAL

00:39:32.737 --> 00:39:33.971
OFFICERS THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING

00:39:34.038 --> 00:39:35.372
TO RECEIVE THE SAME SERVICE.

00:39:35.439 --> 00:39:37.942
ASIDE ANY OTHER TAXPAYER SO --

00:39:38.008 --> 00:39:39.610
UNIFORMITY IS KEY FOR TALKING

00:39:39.677 --> 00:39:41.312
ABOUT A VERY FINITE SET OF

00:39:41.378 --> 00:39:42.346
TAXPAYERS WITH RESPECT TO THE

00:39:42.413 --> 00:39:42.980
CURRENT BOARD OF EQUALIZATION

00:39:43.047 --> 00:39:43.914
DUTIES.

00:39:43.981 --> 00:39:45.516
AND I DO BELIEVE THAT --

00:39:45.583 --> 00:39:46.150
THEY WILL BE --

00:39:46.217 --> 00:39:47.918
WILL SERVE UP REALLY ANYWHERE IN

00:39:47.985 --> 00:39:48.953
STATE GOVERNMENT SONGS

00:39:49.019 --> 00:39:50.488
EXPECTATIONS ARE CLEARER AND

00:39:50.554 --> 00:39:51.555
THERE IS AN AVENUE FOR A

00:39:51.622 --> 00:39:53.624
TAXPAYER RIGHTS ADVOCATES OFFICE

00:39:53.691 --> 00:39:58.529
TO ALSO BE THE CONDUIT FOR VERY

00:39:58.596 --> 00:39:59.396
COMPLEX MATTERS.

00:39:59.463 --> 00:40:00.030
I WILL HAVE A A CLOSING COMMENT

00:40:00.097 --> 00:40:00.931
BUT I WANT TO ASK YOU ONE FINAL

00:40:00.998 --> 00:40:02.032
QUESTION IN IT STEVE --

00:40:02.099 --> 00:40:02.600
ONE FINAL TIME FROM THIS

00:40:02.666 --> 00:40:04.635
COMMITTEE COMMITTEES TO BE ABLE

00:40:04.702 --> 00:40:05.903
TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY CLOSING

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:07.605
COMMENTS FROM EITHER OF YOU

00:40:07.671 --> 00:40:08.439
BEFORE WE TURN OVER THE BE A WE

00:40:08.506 --> 00:40:09.306
CHAIR.

00:40:09.373 --> 00:40:10.741
ADVICE FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE

00:40:10.808 --> 00:40:13.144
LEGISLATURE AS WE MOVE FORWARD

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:14.545
ALONG WITH SENATOR RISES

00:40:14.612 --> 00:40:15.679
COMMITTEES CAN CONTINUE TO

00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:17.047
EVALUATE THIS ISSUE.

00:40:17.114 --> 00:40:18.582
WE'RE ALSO GONNA BE BRINGING IN

00:40:18.649 --> 00:40:19.650
THE COPPER DEPARTMENT TAX AND

00:40:19.717 --> 00:40:20.851
FEE ADMINISTRATION TO DO

00:40:20.918 --> 00:40:22.553
OVERSIGHT IN THEM AS WELL.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.222
AS OVER THE LAST TWENTY MONTHS --

00:40:25.289 --> 00:40:25.689
WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE

00:40:25.756 --> 00:40:26.857
CHALLENGES THERE.

00:40:26.924 --> 00:40:29.393
WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE PARTING

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.228
ADVICE --

00:40:31.295 --> 00:40:33.430
FOR THE LEGISLATURES WE CONSIDER

00:40:33.497 --> 00:40:36.600
TO BE ALWAYS FUTURE.

00:40:36.667 --> 00:40:38.169
I THANK YOU ALL.

00:40:38.235 --> 00:40:39.503
OLIVIA NAILED IT ON THE HEAD I

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:40.538
MEAN I THINK THE FIRST AND

00:40:40.604 --> 00:40:43.474
FOREMOST FOCUS HAS TO BE ON OF

00:40:43.541 --> 00:40:45.943
THE PROGRAMS AND HOW BEST TO

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:47.144
CARRY OUT THOSE PROGRAMS ON

00:40:47.211 --> 00:40:48.646
BEHALF OF THE TAXPAYERS.

00:40:48.712 --> 00:40:50.681
OF THE HAS TO BE THE FOCUS OF

00:40:50.748 --> 00:40:52.149
THE CONVERSATION.

00:40:52.216 --> 00:40:53.818
AND I HOPE IN THE COURSE OF YOUR

00:40:53.884 --> 00:40:55.686
DELIBERATIONS YOU WILL ALSO --

00:40:55.753 --> 00:40:58.689
SIX SOME OF THE INPUT FROM OUR

00:40:58.756 --> 00:41:00.057
TAXPAYER GROUPS AS WELL --

00:41:00.124 --> 00:41:01.659
AND I THINK WE ALL WANT THE SAME

00:41:01.725 --> 00:41:03.093
THING.

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:04.261
THE QUESTION IS HOW ARE WE GOING

00:41:04.328 --> 00:41:06.797
TO CARRY IT OUT AND THAT --

00:41:06.864 --> 00:41:07.965
WHEN WE LOOK AT CALIFORNIA WITH

00:41:08.032 --> 00:41:09.834
OUR UNIQUE SITUATION HAVING THE

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:11.368
ONLY LIKE THE TAX COMMISSION?

00:41:11.435 --> 00:41:12.870
AND LOOKING AT THE SUCCESS OF

00:41:12.937 --> 00:41:13.971
FORTY NINE OTHER STATES --

00:41:14.038 --> 00:41:15.372
WITH THE VARIOUS --

00:41:15.439 --> 00:41:17.842
STRUCTURES THAT THEY HAVE THAT --

00:41:17.908 --> 00:41:19.276
THE NEED FOR AN ELECTED BOARD IS

00:41:19.343 --> 00:41:20.978
OF NO LONGER.

00:41:21.045 --> 00:41:23.080
AND AND IF WE GET THE ANSWER TO

00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:24.315
THAT QUESTION IS --

00:41:24.381 --> 00:41:25.616
NO WE DON'T NEED ELECTED BOARD

00:41:25.683 --> 00:41:26.851
THEN I THINK THE QUESTIONS ARE

00:41:26.917 --> 00:41:28.219
VERY CLEAR.

00:41:28.285 --> 00:41:29.353
FOR OF ALL OF YOU HERE AND THAT

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:31.021
IS SO WHERE DO WE HOUSE THESE

00:41:31.088 --> 00:41:32.623
PROGRAMS WHERE DO WE CONTINUE TO

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:34.258
CONTINUE WHAT WE WHAT WE CAN

00:41:34.325 --> 00:41:36.093
TAKE THE BE SURE THE EXPERTISE

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.295
OF REMAINS ROBUST AND KEYS TO

00:41:38.362 --> 00:41:39.330
GET DEVELOPED.

00:41:39.396 --> 00:41:40.464
AND HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT

00:41:40.531 --> 00:41:42.533
TAXPAYERS HAVE ACCESS. TO THE

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.604
SERVICES THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:48.172
TO AND IT'S VERY SO --

00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:52.576
ON A SEVEN THAT --

00:41:52.643 --> 00:41:54.178
THE CHAIR OF TRANSPORTATION

00:41:54.245 --> 00:41:56.213
ADVANCED HERE IN REGARDS TO GAS

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.481
TAX.

00:41:57.548 --> 00:41:59.650
OXMAN LEE. EIGHTEEN TWENTY

00:41:59.717 --> 00:42:04.021
pINTO THE ISSUE OF MEDICAL

00:42:04.088 --> 00:42:06.023
CANNABIS IN CALIFORNIA BECAME

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:07.958
VERY AWARE THAT THERE WERE

00:42:08.025 --> 00:42:09.627
POLITICAL DECISIONS MADE --

00:42:09.693 --> 00:42:11.095
AT A PREVIOUS BOARD THE PREVIOUS

00:42:11.161 --> 00:42:13.664
BOARD ON TO ACTUALLY COLLECT THE

00:42:13.731 --> 00:42:16.333
TAX ON CANNABIS AND WAS BASED ON

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.868
ONE INDIVIDUAL BOARD MEMBERS

00:42:17.935 --> 00:42:20.938
OPINION NOT TO COLLECT TAX.

00:42:21.005 --> 00:42:22.573
AND I WILL SHARE WITH YOU.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.575
IN THE AREA THAT I REPRESENT THE

00:42:24.642 --> 00:42:27.244
BOARD MEMBER FOLLOWTHE LAW OF

00:42:27.311 --> 00:42:29.313
CALIFORNIA VOTERS AND ENSURE

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:30.981
THAT THERE IS TAX COLLECTED.

00:42:31.048 --> 00:42:34.218
AND THAT WAS A DEEP CONCERN OF

00:42:34.285 --> 00:42:36.487
INAPPROPRIATE MEDDLING --

00:42:36.553 --> 00:42:38.155
WHEN THE VOTERS HAVE SPOKEN ANY

00:42:38.222 --> 00:42:40.591
TAX RATE WAS SET IN THE BOARD

00:42:40.658 --> 00:42:42.159
WAS NOT COLLECTING ON AN EVEN

00:42:42.226 --> 00:42:44.395
BASIS BECAUSE OF BOARD MEMBER

00:42:44.461 --> 00:42:46.330
INVOLVEMENT --

00:42:46.397 --> 00:42:47.965
AND I WILL SAY.

00:42:48.032 --> 00:42:49.633
THAT NUMBER IS NO LONGER THERE --

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.937
BUT THAT IS A DEEP CONCERN WHEN.

00:42:53.003 --> 00:42:54.238
ELECTED OFFICIALS

00:42:54.305 --> 00:42:58.075
INAPPROPRIATELY METAL --

00:42:58.142 --> 00:42:59.376
ANGLE AGAIN STATE LAW.

00:42:59.443 --> 00:43:01.145
I IN THAT HAS REALLY THAT IS

00:43:01.211 --> 00:43:02.780
WHEN MY INTEREST WAS PIQUED OUR

00:43:02.846 --> 00:43:04.148
PARTICULARLY WITHIN THE BOARD OF

00:43:04.214 --> 00:43:07.952
EQUALIZATION AS THAT ACTION HAD

00:43:08.018 --> 00:43:08.752
TO BE STOPPED.

00:43:08.819 --> 00:43:10.454
END OF MOVEMENT WAS MADE TO DO

00:43:10.521 --> 00:43:12.423
THAT BUT AT THAT WAS OF GREAT

00:43:12.489 --> 00:43:17.328
CONCERN CENTER ABOUT.

00:43:17.394 --> 00:43:19.830
I WAS DOING SOME CHUCHUS OVER

00:43:19.897 --> 00:43:20.431
SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WE

00:43:20.497 --> 00:43:23.934
LOST. SIX HUNDRED MILLION

00:43:24.001 --> 00:43:26.837
DOLLARS.

00:43:26.904 --> 00:43:28.372
BY THEM NOT FOLLOWING THE RULES.

00:43:28.439 --> 00:43:30.074
SO SO I THINK I'LL GET THE LIST

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:31.675
OF ALL THE PROJECTS AND ALL YOUR

00:43:31.742 --> 00:43:32.977
DISTRICTS.

00:43:33.043 --> 00:43:35.779
HOW MUCH EACH CITY LOST --

00:43:35.846 --> 00:43:39.583
WILL GET THAT INFORMATION TO YOU --

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:43.721
IT WAS A TRAVESTY IN MY OPINION.

00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:45.723
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:43:45.789 --> 00:43:47.424
MADAM CENTER I'D LIKE TO MAKE

00:43:47.491 --> 00:43:48.292
ONE LAST COMMENT --

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:50.027
WE MADE THE CHANGES THAT WE MADE

00:43:50.094 --> 00:43:51.829
LAST YEAR AND I THINK THAT THIS

00:43:51.895 --> 00:43:53.764
THIS TOPIC DESERVES MUCH MORE

00:43:53.831 --> 00:43:55.632
ATTENTION THAT THAN WHAT WAS

00:43:55.699 --> 00:43:57.167
GIVEN TO IT LAST YEAR AND THAT.

00:43:57.234 --> 00:43:59.236
WE SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

00:43:59.303 --> 00:43:59.970
TO HAVE THE FULL LEGISLATIVE

00:44:00.037 --> 00:44:03.040
YEAR TO LOOK AT OTHER PROPOSALS

00:44:03.107 --> 00:44:04.475
FOR HOW TO HANDLE THE BOARD OF

00:44:04.541 --> 00:44:06.110
EQUALIZATION.

00:44:06.176 --> 00:44:07.644
MY CONCERN IS THAT BY

00:44:07.711 --> 00:44:09.079
DISMANTLING THE BOARD ALL

00:44:09.146 --> 00:44:11.949
TOGETHER AND LEAVING ALL OF THE

00:44:12.016 --> 00:44:14.184
DECISION MAKING AND THE APPEALS

00:44:14.251 --> 00:44:16.186
MATTERS AND ALL OF THE WORK. TO

00:44:16.253 --> 00:44:18.122
STATE AGENCIES ALONG WITHOUT

00:44:18.188 --> 00:44:19.923
ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES WHO ARE

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:21.325
ACCOUNTABLE TO THE TAXPAYERS

00:44:21.392 --> 00:44:23.193
THAT WE ARE IN THE POSITION OF

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:25.062
THEN LEAVING THE TAXPAYER WITH

00:44:25.129 --> 00:44:27.498
LESS THAN A PUBLIC DEFENDER --

00:44:27.564 --> 00:44:29.466
SO I HOPE THAT WE WILL HAVE THE

00:44:29.533 --> 00:44:31.235
OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT HOW WE

00:44:31.301 --> 00:44:33.670
CAN MODERNIZE AND AND

00:44:33.737 --> 00:44:35.539
RESTRUCTURE THE ROLE OF THE

00:44:35.606 --> 00:44:37.107
BOARD OF EQUALIZATION TO GET

00:44:37.174 --> 00:44:38.609
BACK TO THE ORIGINAL INTENT

00:44:38.675 --> 00:44:39.410
WHICH WAS.

00:44:39.476 --> 00:44:42.012

THANK YOU SO MUCH SOONER BUT I'M

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:50.454

BECAUSE OF THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU

EXAMPLE THAT SENATOR DOLE GAVE.

00:44:57.061 --> 00:44:58.796
WHAT DO YOU THINK CONTROLLER

00:44:58.862 --> 00:45:00.264
WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:00.564
[inaudible]

00:45:00.631 --> 00:45:02.566
UNDER.

00:45:02.633 --> 00:45:04.268
A NEW A STRUCTURE WITHOUT THE

00:45:08.138 --> 00:45:09.773
WHAT HOW WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:10.441
DEALT WITH --

00:45:10.507 --> 00:45:11.575

MADAM CHAIRWOMAN THE --

00:45:15.579 --> 00:45:16.513
I BELIEVE THE RESULT WOULD HAVE

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:17.781
BEEN DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE

00:45:17.848 --> 00:45:18.315
OVERSIGHT THE POINTS OF

00:45:18.382 --> 00:45:20.084
OVERSIGHT.

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:21.385
RESPONSIBILITY WOULD BE

00:45:21.452 --> 00:45:24.421
DIFFERENT OF THE MEMBERS AND

00:45:24.488 --> 00:45:25.889
CERTAINLY NOW WITH EXECUTIVE

00:45:25.956 --> 00:45:27.558
BRANCH OF DEPARTMENTS.

00:45:27.624 --> 00:45:29.626
OF THAT RESPONSIBILITY THE COUNT

00:45:29.693 --> 00:45:30.794
REALLY RESIDES WITH --

00:45:30.861 --> 00:45:32.463
WELL FIRST IN MY WITH MY OLD OUT

00:45:32.529 --> 00:45:34.698
ON A DEPARTMENT FINANCE WILL BE

00:45:34.765 --> 00:45:36.166
YOU KNOW REALLY --

00:45:36.233 --> 00:45:37.301
TO ACCEPT THAT IS A REVENUE

00:45:37.367 --> 00:45:39.002
GENERATING ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE

00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:40.871
CERTAINLY MONITORING THE REVIEWS

00:45:40.938 --> 00:45:42.606
ARE BEING GENERATED OF THE LIST

00:45:42.673 --> 00:45:44.141
AS CENTER BILLS EXAMPLE WITH

00:45:44.208 --> 00:45:46.443
RESPECT TO THE TRUE UP ON THE

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:48.078
GAS TAX WHAT WAS --

00:45:48.145 --> 00:45:49.780
A SOMETHING INDICATIVE OF A KIND

00:45:49.847 --> 00:45:51.014
OF A ROLE THAT I PREVIOUSLY

00:45:51.081 --> 00:45:52.049
PLAYED AT THE FARM TO FINANCE

00:45:52.116 --> 00:45:53.684
ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR WOULD

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:55.052
ENSURE THAT THAT TRIP HAPPEN

00:45:55.119 --> 00:45:55.819
THAT CAN BE DONE

00:45:55.886 --> 00:45:57.554
ADMINISTRATIVELY --

00:45:57.621 --> 00:45:58.689
AND I THINK --

00:45:58.755 --> 00:46:00.424
BECAUSE THEY'RE SOME OF THE

00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:01.492
POLITICAL OVERTONES TO THAT TRUE

00:46:01.558 --> 00:46:02.960
UP WHEN I THOUGHT THE

00:46:03.026 --> 00:46:04.194
LEGISLATIVE INTENT WAS VERY

00:46:04.261 --> 00:46:05.696
CLEAR ABOUT THE REVENUE JOLLITY.

00:46:05.762 --> 00:46:07.164
OF THAT COULD HAVE BEEN AN

00:46:07.231 --> 00:46:08.098
ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES THAT COULD

00:46:08.165 --> 00:46:09.566
HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT AND THEN

00:46:09.633 --> 00:46:11.001
THE OBVIOUSLY THE SECOND BRANCH

00:46:11.068 --> 00:46:12.536
OUT RESPONSIBLE.

00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:13.303

WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH TODAY.

00:56:05.095 --> 00:56:08.198

KEEPING THE THE BOARD ELECTED

00:56:10.567 --> 00:56:11.735

00:56:11.801 --> 00:56:13.436
THAT TO OUR FOREFATHERS I MEAN

00:56:13.503 --> 00:56:15.271
PEOPLE YOU SAID IN YOUR OPENING

00:56:15.338 --> 00:56:15.839
REMARKS A HUNDRED AND FORTY

00:56:15.905 --> 00:56:17.140
YEARS.

00:56:17.207 --> 00:56:22.078
AND WHITE WHY DID THE MEN.

00:56:22.145 --> 00:56:23.747
DECIDE TO MAKE THE STATE BOARD

00:56:23.813 --> 00:56:25.648
OF EQUALIZATION.

00:56:25.715 --> 00:56:27.350
CONSTITUTION ELECTED BODY

00:56:27.417 --> 00:56:30.620
BECAUSE THERE WAS CORRUPTION.

00:56:30.687 --> 00:56:33.223
THERE WAS AN TRANSPARENCY.

00:56:33.289 --> 00:56:35.859
THERE WAS AN AN EQUITABLE WAY

00:56:35.925 --> 00:56:37.293
BETTER BUSINESS IS BEING DONE.

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:38.895
AND I AM OF THE MINDSET THAT WE

00:56:38.962 --> 00:56:40.430
MUST UNDERSTAND A LOOK AT OUR

00:56:40.497 --> 00:56:42.899
PAST IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND A

00:56:42.966 --> 00:56:43.500
MOVE FORWARD TO MOVE INTO THE

00:56:43.566 --> 00:56:44.601
FUTURE.

00:56:44.667 --> 00:56:47.003
AND I THINK IT WOULD BE SHORT

00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:50.106
SIGHTED OF US.

00:56:50.173 --> 00:56:51.875
TO NOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ALL FOR A

00:56:51.941 --> 00:56:53.343
HUNDRED AND FORTY YEAR HISTORY

00:56:53.409 --> 00:56:54.844
NOW IN THAT HISTORY IS IN THE

00:56:54.911 --> 00:56:56.513
HISTORY OF THE CONSTITUTION OF

00:56:56.579 --> 00:56:57.347
THE UNITED STATES WHICH BY THE

00:56:57.413 --> 00:56:59.215
WAY IS A HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED

00:56:59.282 --> 00:57:02.619
TWENTY NINE YEARS OLD.

00:57:02.685 --> 00:57:04.687
WE NEED TO BE THOUGHTFUL IN THE

00:57:04.754 --> 00:57:06.322
APPROACH.

00:57:06.389 --> 00:57:08.858
AND WE ARE A DEMOCRACY AN

00:57:08.925 --> 00:57:11.928
ELECTED BODY.

00:57:11.995 --> 00:57:15.165
AND THAT IS SERIOUS PEOPLE HAVE

00:57:15.231 --> 00:57:17.534
GIVEN THEIR LIVES TO MAINTAIN --

00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:19.102
THIS DEMOCRACY.

00:57:19.169 --> 00:57:21.037
AND MY CASE FOR KEEPING THAT

00:57:21.104 --> 00:57:23.573
THIS BODY ELECTED A REALLY STEMS

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.275
FROM MAKING SURE THAT IT IS THAT

00:57:25.341 --> 00:57:26.943
THIS BODY CONTINUES TO BE VITAL

00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:28.678
IN ANY CAN FULFILL ITS

00:57:28.745 --> 00:57:30.313
CONSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES.

IT'S GETTING TO BE A

01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:48.984
PROGRESSIVELY MORE DIFFICULT.

01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:50.119

01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:52.354
SAY WE CANNOT FAIL. TO PROTECT

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:54.156

PROTECT THOSE ASSETS.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:05.801
AGAIN THE LEGISLATION WAS NOT

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:07.369
INTENDED TO REDUCE THESE OUT

01:10:07.436 --> 01:10:08.904
COMMON WE UNDERSTAND THAT.

THEY WERE CONTAINED IN THE

01:10:12.508 --> 01:10:14.109

01:11:16.805 --> 01:11:18.841
SO.

01:11:18.907 --> 01:11:20.576
THE CHAIRWOMAN HAS ACCURATELY

01:11:20.643 --> 01:11:24.213
STATED THAT --

01:11:24.279 --> 01:11:26.115
THE CHALLENGES OF THE PAST.

01:11:26.181 --> 01:11:27.316
I'M PARAPHRASING HERE BY THE WAY

01:11:27.383 --> 01:11:28.317
MADAM CHAIR.

01:11:28.384 --> 01:11:31.020
THE CHALLENGES OF THE PAST ON

01:11:31.086 --> 01:11:32.521
THE BOARD.

01:11:32.588 --> 01:11:33.455
WHO IS CURRENTLY SEED

01:11:33.522 --> 01:11:33.756
[inaudible]

01:11:33.822 --> 01:11:37.493
AND THE REASON WHY SOME OF THE

01:11:37.559 --> 01:11:39.628
REASONS WHY --

01:11:39.695 --> 01:11:41.063
THE BOARD EQUALIZATION WAS

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:42.398
CREATED.

01:11:42.464 --> 01:11:44.933
BECAUSE OF CORRUPTION THAT WE

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.402
SAW BETWEEN COUNTIES

01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:47.503
PARTICULARLY THOSE COUNTIES THAT

01:11:47.569 --> 01:11:49.038
WERE GOLD MINING COUNTIES VERSUS

01:11:49.104 --> 01:11:50.305
COUNTIES THAT WERE.

01:11:50.372 --> 01:11:51.974
AGRICULTURAL COUNTIES --

01:11:52.041 --> 01:11:53.575
THAT'S WHY THE BE A WE WAS

01:11:53.642 --> 01:11:55.577
ADVANCE.

01:11:55.644 --> 01:11:57.379
AND I DO BELIEVE THAT. ONE OF

01:11:57.446 --> 01:11:59.515
THE MAJOR REASONS WHY A B. ONE

01:11:59.581 --> 01:12:01.483
OF TWO SUCCESSFUL IS BECAUSE THE

01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:04.386
LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN CANDIDLY.

01:12:04.453 --> 01:12:06.255
CORRUPTION --

01:12:06.321 --> 01:12:07.790
OVER THE PAST TWENTY MONTHS

01:12:07.856 --> 01:12:08.090
[inaudible]

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:09.992
I WILL.

01:12:10.059 --> 01:12:11.527
AGREE WITH THE CHAIR WOMAN --

01:12:11.593 --> 01:12:12.895
IT'S A NEW BOARD.

01:12:12.961 --> 01:12:14.296
NO ONE WAS THERE.

01:12:14.363 --> 01:12:16.532
AT THE TIME AND WANTING TO BE

01:12:16.598 --> 01:12:18.567
ABLE TO SHIFT IN FOCUS ON THIS

01:12:18.634 --> 01:12:19.835
NEW DAY.

01:12:19.902 --> 01:12:21.370
SO I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO IT IF

01:12:21.437 --> 01:12:23.172
YOU ALL DON'T MIND TALK TO US

01:12:23.238 --> 01:12:26.075
HOW THAT CULTURE HAS CHANGED.

01:12:26.141 --> 01:12:28.243
SINCE THE LEGISLATURES ENACTED

01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:30.646
AB ONE TWO OVER THE LAST TWENTY

01:12:30.713 --> 01:12:31.780
MONTHS.

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:34.516
RIGHT I'M GOING TO DO --

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:35.551
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TO

01:12:35.617 --> 01:12:37.286
TALK ABOUT FROM OF

01:12:37.352 --> 01:12:39.354
ADMINISTRATIVE PER --

01:12:39.421 --> 01:12:41.457
REALITY A WELL WHERE WE ARE THE

01:12:41.523 --> 01:12:42.758
STAFF THANK YOU --

01:12:42.825 --> 01:12:45.127
THANK YOU FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY I

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:47.930
THINK PRIMARILY --

01:12:47.996 --> 01:12:49.565
THE PRIOR BOARD BE WE WENT OUT

01:12:49.631 --> 01:12:52.234
ON IN ITS DUTIES HAD

01:12:52.301 --> 01:12:55.471
INVESTIGATORY RESPONSIBILITIES --

01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:57.272
HAD H. R. RESPONSIBILITIES I WAS

01:12:57.339 --> 01:12:59.141
ABLE TO HIRE AND FIRE YOU KNOW

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:00.709
EXECUTIVE STAFF --

01:13:00.776 --> 01:13:02.010
CA SIX AFTER.

01:13:02.077 --> 01:13:03.545
HAD I'M A THIRTY TWO TO

01:13:03.612 --> 01:13:05.314
EDUCATION EDUCATION EDUCATION

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:07.382
OUTREACH WITH FUNDING TO DO THAT --

01:13:07.449 --> 01:13:09.284
AND I THINK THAT CLIMATE NIGHT

01:13:09.351 --> 01:13:12.154
EAGLES --

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:13.088
WHAT I REFER TO AS MAYBE A

01:13:13.155 --> 01:13:14.623
CLIMATE OF SOME TEMPTATIONS --

01:13:14.690 --> 01:13:15.924
AND SOME DOORS THAT YOU COULD

01:13:15.991 --> 01:13:16.892
PROBABLY OPEN AND TAKE ADVANTAGE

01:13:16.959 --> 01:13:20.262
OF OF A NUMBER OF THOSE THOSE --

01:13:20.329 --> 01:13:21.363
AVENUES --

01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:22.698
AND THAT SAID I THINK BECAUSE

01:13:22.765 --> 01:13:24.233
THOSE EXISTED --

01:13:24.299 --> 01:13:25.467
I THINK THE MEMBERS AT THE TIME

01:13:25.534 --> 01:13:26.735
AND I'M NOT HERE REALLY TO TO

01:13:26.802 --> 01:13:28.137
INDICT ANYONE OR SPEAK TO WHAT

01:13:28.203 --> 01:13:29.805
THEIR MOTIVES ARE IT JUST WAS A

01:13:29.872 --> 01:13:33.442
CLIMATE OF OF OF OF THEIR DUTIES --

01:13:33.509 --> 01:13:35.110
AND SOME OF THOSE FUNCTIONS THAT --

01:13:35.177 --> 01:13:36.044
I THINK THEY FELT LIKE THEY WERE

01:13:36.111 --> 01:13:37.746
SERVING THE TAXPAYERS AND DOING

01:13:37.813 --> 01:13:38.447
IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE

01:13:38.514 --> 01:13:39.815
TAXPAYERS BUT I THINK IT DID

01:13:39.882 --> 01:13:40.749
CREATE --

01:13:40.816 --> 01:13:42.317
SOME SCENARIOS AND I THINK WE'VE

01:13:42.384 --> 01:13:43.585
HEARD THIS IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS

01:13:43.652 --> 01:13:45.254
I'VE TESTIFIED AT WHERE YOU KNOW

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.755
THEIR NUMBER OF EXECUTIVES IN CA

01:13:46.822 --> 01:13:47.756
SAID FELT LIKE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE

01:13:47.823 --> 01:13:48.857
TO COUNT THE VOTES ECCENTRICITY

01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:50.259
OF HER ALL THAT AND I HEAR.

01:13:50.325 --> 01:13:52.895
TO REWIND TO THAT TO THAT STORYABOUT TIME.

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:55.430
BUT THAT WAS THE CLIMATE AT THE

01:13:55.497 --> 01:13:58.133
TIME AND SO I CHALLENGING ISSUES

01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.301
THAT THEY SAW SOME IMPROPRIETIES

01:13:59.368 --> 01:14:00.836
THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN --

01:14:00.903 --> 01:14:01.837
A LEVEL OF DISCOMFORT TO RESPOND

01:14:01.904 --> 01:14:02.337
TO THAT.

01:14:02.404 --> 01:14:04.973
BUT THE CURRENT ORGANIZATION THE

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.742
THAT THAT TAXPAYERS TRANSPARENCY

01:14:06.809 --> 01:14:08.443
ACT HAS RESOLVED MUSCLES ISSUES

01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:09.611
FIRST AND FOREMOST SO THEY CAN

01:14:09.678 --> 01:14:10.879
THEY NO LONGER HAVE THE

01:14:10.946 --> 01:14:11.713
INVESTIGATORY ROLES

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.115
RESPONSIBILITIES.

01:14:13.182 --> 01:14:14.416
THEY DO HAVE THE ADJUDICATORY

01:14:14.483 --> 01:14:15.951
RESPONSIBILITIES AND THAT IS --

01:14:16.018 --> 01:14:17.085
GIVING THEM THAT THAT THE

01:14:17.152 --> 01:14:18.253
AUTHORITY TO HEAR --

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.988
OUR APPEALS CASES --

01:14:20.055 --> 01:14:21.690
FOR STATUS AS SEES EXCEPT --

01:14:21.757 --> 01:14:23.292
FOR AND THE LEGISLATION ALSO IF

01:14:23.358 --> 01:14:24.493
YOU WANT TO LEGISLATION ALSO

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:28.130
ADDRESSED --

01:14:28.197 --> 01:14:29.064
THE BOARD'S ROLE.

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:29.798
TO AN AUTHORITY TO WORK WITH

01:14:29.865 --> 01:14:30.933
THEIR EMPLOYEES --

01:14:30.999 --> 01:14:32.401
SPECIFICALLY THE BOARD MEMBER

01:14:32.467 --> 01:14:33.569
STAFF -- AND

01:14:33.635 --> 01:14:34.603
WHILE I'M ONE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES

01:14:34.670 --> 01:14:36.772
FOR FOUR OF THE FIVE THEN THE

01:14:36.839 --> 01:14:37.606
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR'S

01:14:37.673 --> 01:14:39.842
RESPONSIBILITY IS TO RUN THE DAY

01:14:39.908 --> 01:14:41.210
TO DAY OPERATIONS AND SOUL THAT

01:14:41.276 --> 01:14:42.644
LEGISLATION SPEAKS TO THE BOARDS --

01:14:42.711 --> 01:14:44.046
LIMITATION AND BEING ABLE TO GO

01:14:44.112 --> 01:14:45.514
INSIDE THE AGENCY I THINK IT'S

01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:46.748
REALLY THAT'S THAT'S THE MOST

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:47.816
SIGNIFICANT THING --

01:14:47.883 --> 01:14:48.650
AND I THINK AS A RESULT THE

01:14:48.717 --> 01:14:50.018
STAFFER FEELING MORE COMFORTABLE

01:14:50.085 --> 01:14:51.486
THAT THEY CAN JUST YOU KNOW --

01:14:51.553 --> 01:14:53.488
THEY CAN JUST OPERATE THE AGENCY

01:14:53.555 --> 01:14:55.490
AND USE THEIR EXPERTISE.

01:14:55.557 --> 01:14:56.959
THANK YOU YEAH AND I APPRECIATE

LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

01:15:01.597 --> 01:15:03.131
REORGANIZATION SHIFT

01:15:03.198 --> 01:15:04.233
RESPONSIBILITIES.

01:15:04.299 --> 01:15:06.001
THE SAME QUESTION THAT WE ASKED

01:15:06.068 --> 01:15:07.302
THE CONTROLLER.

01:15:07.369 --> 01:15:09.905
IS AN INDEPENDENTLY ELECTED.

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:11.373
BE A WE STILL NECESSARY IN

01:15:17.312 --> 01:15:20.015

01:15:20.082 --> 01:15:21.617
MAJORITY RESPONSIBILITIES ARE

NOW ANOTHER AGENCY --

01:15:23.685 --> 01:15:25.487
AND IT'S NOW FOCUS ON SOME

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:26.855

ANYTHING IS STILL RELEVANT IN A

01:15:40.836 --> 01:15:43.372
DEMOCRACY I THINK THAT IN ORDER

01:15:43.438 --> 01:15:44.473
TO SOLVE PROBLEMS WE DON'T NEED

01:15:44.539 --> 01:15:45.807
LESS DEMOCRACY YOU NEED MORE

01:15:45.874 --> 01:15:46.708
DEMOCRACY.

01:15:46.775 --> 01:15:48.410
AND I'M CONCERNED WHEN THINGS

01:15:48.477 --> 01:15:49.578
ARE PLACED IN A BUREAUCRATIC

01:15:49.645 --> 01:15:51.213
STRUCTURE THAT SUNSHINE WON'T

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:53.282
GET IN TRANSPARENCY WILL BE

01:15:53.348 --> 01:15:57.185
SQUELCHED AND ASSESS ABILITY AND

01:15:57.252 --> 01:15:59.221
ACCOUNTABILITY WILL NOT BE

01:15:59.288 --> 01:16:02.557
ADEQUATELY --

01:16:02.624 --> 01:16:03.625
ADMINISTERED.

01:16:03.692 --> 01:16:05.594
AM I THINK ABOUT THIS I THINK

01:16:05.661 --> 01:16:06.628
ABOUT JUST THE CURRENT STATE OF

01:16:06.695 --> 01:16:07.930
WHERE WE ARE PARTICULARLY

01:16:07.996 --> 01:16:09.798
SENATOR IN YOUR DISTRICT MET THE

01:16:09.865 --> 01:16:11.400
THE FIRES THAT HAVE RAVAGED.

01:16:11.466 --> 01:16:13.335
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND PARTS OF

01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:14.903
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THINKING

01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:16.905
ABOUT THE FLOODS THAT THAT WE

01:16:16.972 --> 01:16:18.573
ARE NOW ALL GRAPPLING WITH QUITE

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.142
HONESTLY THIS ALL SQUARELY HAS

01:16:20.208 --> 01:16:23.412
TO DO WITH PROPERTY TAXES NOW.

01:16:23.478 --> 01:16:25.580
THE DISCUSSIONS EARLIER AGAIN

01:16:25.647 --> 01:16:26.915
WORK FOCUSED AND CENTERED ON

01:16:26.982 --> 01:16:28.850
SALES AND USE TAX AND I THINK

01:16:28.917 --> 01:16:30.152
IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A MISNOMER

01:16:30.218 --> 01:16:31.286
TO SAY --

01:16:31.353 --> 01:16:33.889
THAT THERE'S NOTHING LEFT.

01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:35.457
YES I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE ROLE

01:16:35.524 --> 01:16:36.692
HAS BEEN REDUCED BUT THERE IS

01:16:36.758 --> 01:16:37.759
STILL A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

01:16:37.826 --> 01:16:39.661
WORK QUITE FRANKLY TECHNICAL

01:16:39.728 --> 01:16:40.395
WORK.

01:16:40.462 --> 01:16:41.630
AS YOU HEARD IN THE EXECUTIVE

01:16:41.697 --> 01:16:43.498
DIRECTOR'S REMARKS I DON'T KNOW

01:16:43.565 --> 01:16:45.033
IF YOU REALIZE THIS BUT FIVE

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:47.903
POINT SEVEN TRILLION DOLLARS.

01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:49.604
OF PROPERTY IS ASSESSED IN THE

01:16:49.671 --> 01:16:51.406
STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S A LOT

01:16:51.473 --> 01:16:52.607
OF PROPERTY THAT NEEDS

01:16:52.674 --> 01:16:54.176
ASSESSMENTTHAT'S A LOT OF

01:16:54.242 --> 01:16:55.110
WORKING.

01:16:55.177 --> 01:16:57.579
HAND IN HAND WITH PROPERTY

01:16:57.646 --> 01:16:58.880
ASSESSORS.

01:16:58.947 --> 01:17:00.882
NOW -- I

01:17:00.949 --> 01:17:04.653
BELIEVE THAT --

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.788
WITH THE REALITY OF THE FLOODS

01:17:06.855 --> 01:17:09.658
AND THE FIRES THAT ASSESSORS

01:17:09.725 --> 01:17:12.194
HAVE FIND THEMSELVES --

01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:13.562
I WOULD IMAGINE UNDER RESOURCE

01:17:13.628 --> 01:17:15.530
UNDERSTAFFED I DON'T KNOW IF YOU

01:17:15.597 --> 01:17:16.865
KNOW THIS BUT THE APPRAISAL

01:17:16.932 --> 01:17:18.433
BUSINESS IS ALMOST A DYING

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.402
BUSINESS WE NEED.

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:21.470
TO THINK CREATIVELY DEVELOP

01:17:21.536 --> 01:17:23.238
RELATIONSHIPS WITH INSTITUTIONS

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:26.074
OF EDUCATION AND APPEAL TO A NEW

01:17:26.141 --> 01:17:27.943
GENERATION SO THEY WILL BE ABLE

01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:29.778
TO GOING TO CONTINUE TO FILL THE

01:17:29.845 --> 01:17:31.246
PIPELINE OF TALENT.

01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:33.749
AND OUR JOB AS THE BOARD OF

01:17:33.815 --> 01:17:35.117
EQUALIZATION IS TO WORK DIRECTLY

01:17:35.183 --> 01:17:36.284
WITH THE SS IS ENSURING THAT

01:17:36.351 --> 01:17:37.285
THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES BUT MOST

01:17:37.352 --> 01:17:39.287
IMPORTANTLY THAT THEY HAVE THE

01:17:39.354 --> 01:17:41.757
RULES THE REGULATIONS --

01:17:41.823 --> 01:17:43.892
SURVEYS THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE

01:17:43.959 --> 01:17:45.560
AS A BODY PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND

01:17:45.627 --> 01:17:47.429

01:17:47.496 --> 01:17:50.265
THEM TO HAVE A SYSTEM AND DOING

01:17:50.332 --> 01:17:53.001
IN DOING THEIR BUSINESS.

01:17:53.068 --> 01:17:54.936
THE ASSESSMENT OF FIVE POINT

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:57.305
SEVEN TRILLION DOLLARS BRINGS IN

01:17:57.372 --> 01:17:57.973
SIXTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS INTO

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:00.075
THE GENERAL FUND.

01:18:00.142 --> 01:18:03.311
THAT WE USED TO PAY OUR FIRST

01:18:03.378 --> 01:18:05.914
RESPONDERS TO PAY OUR EDUCATORS

01:18:05.981 --> 01:18:08.150
AND SO THERE IS A STRONG AND I

01:18:08.216 --> 01:18:10.352
THINK OF CONVINCING CORRELATION

01:18:10.419 --> 01:18:12.320
THAT THERE IS CERTAINLY IS A

01:18:12.387 --> 01:18:14.689
REASON TO CONTINUE TO ALLOW AN

01:18:14.756 --> 01:18:15.457

01:22:10.458 --> 01:22:11.726
QUESTIONING I I LEAVE THAT IS

01:22:11.793 --> 01:22:13.395
VERY IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL AND

01:22:13.461 --> 01:22:15.497
THE PROCESS THAT USUALLY THE

01:22:15.563 --> 01:22:16.865

01:22:16.931 --> 01:22:18.300
OMINOUS TAKING PRIDE IN IS IS

01:22:18.366 --> 01:22:19.834
THAT THEY HAVE SWEEPING CHANGES

01:22:19.901 --> 01:22:21.169

USE TAX WAS EASY TO

01:25:02.497 --> 01:25:03.531
UNDERPRIVILEGED UNDERSTAND

01:25:03.598 --> 01:25:05.066
THEREFORE THEY GRASP ON IT THE

01:25:08.503 --> 01:25:09.904
IS WHAT'S GOING WRONG IN THIS IS

01:25:09.971 --> 01:25:14.542
ODD -- ONE

01:25:14.609 --> 01:25:16.077
OF THE AUDIENCE OF THE SENATOR

IT ONE OF THE ITEMS SAID THAT

01:25:18.112 --> 01:25:19.147
THEY WERE SOMETHING LIKE.

01:25:19.214 --> 01:25:19.914
SEVERAL MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT

01:25:19.981 --> 01:25:22.050
WERE MISSING OR UNACCOUNTED FOR

01:25:22.116 --> 01:25:23.751

SALES AND USE TAX I WANT TO MAKE

01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:27.088
SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT

01:25:27.155 --> 01:25:28.156
OUR CORE FUNCTION IN OUR CORE

01:25:28.223 --> 01:25:29.657
FUNCTION IN OUR BUSINESS.

01:25:29.724 --> 01:25:31.125
THERE'S NEVER BEEN A DISPUTE

01:25:31.192 --> 01:25:32.927
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO COUNT EVERY

01:25:32.994 --> 01:25:34.529
SINGLE DOLLAR WHEN IT COMES TO

01:25:34.596 --> 01:25:35.763
PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENT AND

01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:37.098
SINCE THAT IS THE PURVIEW

01:25:37.165 --> 01:25:39.267
CONSTITUTIONALLY GIVEN TO THE

01:25:39.334 --> 01:25:40.869
STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION I

01:25:40.935 --> 01:25:42.704
WANT TO STAND UP AND DEFEND THAT.

01:25:42.770 --> 01:25:43.571
AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT REMAINS

01:25:43.638 --> 01:25:45.707
INTACT THE BE A WEEK IS NOT

01:25:45.773 --> 01:25:47.742
SOLELY ITS REPUTATION WHEN IT

01:25:47.809 --> 01:25:49.677
COMES TO THE MAIN CORE

01:25:49.744 --> 01:25:51.412
CONSTITUTIONAL FUNCTION.

01:25:51.479 --> 01:25:54.282
IN IN WHERE THE 9295% CAME FROM

01:25:54.349 --> 01:25:56.217
IS THAT --

01:25:56.284 --> 01:25:58.219
THE GOVERNOR THE LEGISLATURE --

01:25:58.286 --> 01:26:00.388
TRANSITIONED RESPONSIBILITIES

01:26:00.455 --> 01:26:02.657
MINUS WHAT IS MANDATED IN THE

01:26:02.724 --> 01:26:03.725

01:26:03.791 --> 01:26:04.926
IN THE AGENCY WENT FROM

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:06.828
APPROXIMATELY FORTY TWO HUNDRED

01:26:06.895 --> 01:26:08.263

01:26:08.329 --> 01:26:08.963
EMPLOYEES --

01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:11.399
AND SO THAT'S WHERE THAT THE

01:26:11.466 --> 01:26:13.067
PERCENTAGE CAME FROM AND I THINK

01:26:13.134 --> 01:26:14.269
EVENTUALLY.

01:26:14.335 --> 01:26:15.603
IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE SOME TYPE

01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:17.305
OF DISCUSSION --

01:26:17.372 --> 01:26:19.674
ABOUT ROLES RESPONSIBILITIES AND

01:26:19.741 --> 01:26:22.510

01:26:30.385 --> 01:26:32.020
WHEN THE VAST MAJORITY

01:26:32.086 --> 01:26:33.488
RESPONSIBILITIES ARE SHIFTED

01:26:33.555 --> 01:26:34.689
THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME TYPE

01:26:34.756 --> 01:26:36.224
OF SHIFT THE COMPENSATION?

01:26:36.291 --> 01:26:38.293
THAT WOULD FOLLOW WAS IT WHAT'S

01:26:38.359 --> 01:26:39.260
INTERESTING IS IS THAT WE'VE

01:26:39.327 --> 01:26:40.695
TALKED ABOUT THE SHIFTING OF THE

01:26:40.762 --> 01:26:41.796

ASSESSORS NOW IF IT PASSES THAT

01:36:45.633 --> 01:36:47.368
WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT

01:36:47.434 --> 01:36:49.503
ON ON ASSESSORS PARTICULARLY

01:36:49.570 --> 01:36:50.905
SENSORS THAT ARE REPRESENTED IN

01:36:50.971 --> 01:36:53.207
RURAL COUNTIES WHERE THEY ARE

01:36:53.274 --> 01:36:54.942
UNDER RESOURCE ALREADY IN THEIR

01:36:55.009 --> 01:36:55.943
DAILY FUNCTION.

01:36:56.010 --> 01:36:57.545
AND WE WILL NEED TO WORK

01:36:57.611 --> 01:36:58.812
COLLECTIVELY TO CREATE --

01:36:58.879 --> 01:37:00.548
RULES AND GUIDELINES AND GIVE

01:37:00.614 --> 01:37:01.882
THEM ASSISTANCE SO THAT THEY CAN

01:37:01.949 --> 01:37:04.185
COMPLY WITH WHAT THE VOTERS HAVE

01:37:04.251 --> 01:37:07.121
PUT FORWARD --

01:37:07.188 --> 01:37:10.591
LARGER COUNTIES CHANGE AND AND

01:37:10.658 --> 01:37:12.226

01:37:12.293 --> 01:37:13.394
WAS YOU FOR MISSILE THE

01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:15.329
EUPHEMISTICALLY DESCRIBED AS A

01:37:15.396 --> 01:37:17.565
SPLIT ROLE SPLITTING RESIDENTIAL

01:37:17.631 --> 01:37:19.133
FROM COMMERCIAL PROPERTY IN THAT

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:21.569
ASSESSMENT BUT YOU KNOW A IT IS

01:37:21.635 --> 01:37:22.736
IN THE FUTURE IT IS TO BE

01:37:22.803 --> 01:37:23.537
DETERMINED.

01:37:23.604 --> 01:37:25.139
I AM HERE TO MAKE THE CASE THAT

01:37:25.206 --> 01:37:26.707
NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO BEGIN TO

01:37:26.774 --> 01:37:28.175
QUESTION WHETHER NOT A

01:37:28.242 --> 01:37:28.742
DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED BODY

01:37:28.809 --> 01:37:29.777
SHOULD.

01:37:29.843 --> 01:37:31.412
SHOULD EXIST OR SHOULD NOT EXIST

01:37:31.478 --> 01:37:33.147
I THINK THAT THIS IS ANOTHER

01:37:33.214 --> 01:37:35.416
EXAMPLE THAT FURTHER DRIVES HOME

01:37:35.482 --> 01:37:36.984
THE POINT THAT WE NEED TO

01:37:37.051 --> 01:37:39.353
CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND

01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:41.622
HAVE A BODY THAT IS NOT LEARNING.

01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:44.091
BUT HAS A DEMONSTRATED TRACK LAP

01:37:44.158 --> 01:37:46.260

01:37:51.932 --> 01:37:53.400
MIGHT NOTE THAT.

01:37:53.467 --> 01:37:57.104
THE RURAL AREAS WOULD RATHER

01:37:57.171 --> 01:37:58.072
VIEW THAT.

01:37:58.138 --> 01:37:58.939
TO AND NOT THAT THEY'RE UNDER

01:37:59.006 --> 01:38:01.909
RESOURCE BUT THEY'RE OVERTAXED.

01:38:01.976 --> 01:38:03.043
AND THAT IS STILL THEIR POINT OF

01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:05.279
VIEW.

01:38:05.346 --> 01:38:06.513
I THINK THAT'S STILL THE POINT

01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:08.482
OF VIEW OF MOST CALIFORNIANS.

01:38:08.549 --> 01:38:09.717
AND WE WILL REST WITH THAT

01:38:09.783 --> 01:38:11.252

TO DO A BETTER THAN AN AGENCY

01:39:12.046 --> 01:39:14.248
THAT HAS BEEN DOING IT FOR AS

01:39:14.315 --> 01:39:16.750

AT THE CHAIR WOMAN.

01:39:25.459 --> 01:39:27.127
THIS CURRENT BOARD HAD NOTHING

01:39:27.194 --> 01:39:29.229

01:40:39.733 --> 01:40:41.301
CONVERSATION IN THE HALLS AROUND

UNFORTUNATELY DON'T KNOW IF

01:40:49.476 --> 01:40:50.377
SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T KNOW WE

01:40:50.444 --> 01:40:51.445

CONNECTED AND REMEMBER WHO THEY

01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:27.948
SERVE.

01:41:28.015 --> 01:41:30.050

ANY KIND OF AGENCY THAT YOU NEED

01:41:37.791 --> 01:41:39.793

THE BUREAUCRATI STRUCTURE IS

01:41:44.398 --> 01:41:45.666
THAT REALLY --

01:41:45.732 --> 01:41:47.935
MEETINGS ARE TELEVISED YOU GET

01:41:48.001 --> 01:41:49.369
MINUTES YOU DON'T GET TO A TEE

01:41:49.436 --> 01:41:50.504

01:41:50.571 --> 01:41:52.940
SOMEONE ELSE'S SUMMATION OF WHAT

TRANSPIRED IN THE MEAT IN THE

01:41:53.974 --> 01:41:55.375
MEETINGS AND I THINK THAT THERE

01:41:55.442 --> 01:41:57.611
WAS SOMETHING THAT IS LOST.

01:41:57.678 --> 01:41:59.880

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EVERY DAY

01:42:03.550 --> 01:42:05.219
PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE THE

IT TO HIRE A LAWYER TO WALK THE

01:42:11.525 --> 01:42:13.193
HALLS AN ADVOCATE ON THEIR

THAT'S TO BE DETERMINED THE

01:42:31.478 --> 01:42:32.679

WILL THEY BE ABLE TO DO IT WELL

01:42:34.248 --> 01:42:34.481

01:42:34.548 --> 01:42:36.216
THE MANAGER.

01:42:36.283 --> 01:42:38.318
MANAGING DIRECTOR ANY ITEMS --

01:42:38.385 --> 01:42:39.353
SO I CAN KERR --

01:42:39.419 --> 01:42:41.121
I KNOW THIS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

01:42:41.188 --> 01:42:42.489
I DO --

01:42:42.556 --> 01:42:43.724
INPUT ON THE HALF AND I'M NOT

01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:44.658
JUST THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF

01:42:44.725 --> 01:42:46.560
THE AGENCY AND REPRESENTING OUR

01:42:46.627 --> 01:42:48.195
EMPLOYEES AND OUR BOARD --

01:42:48.262 --> 01:42:50.797
BUT JUST AS A CITIZEN.

01:42:50.864 --> 01:42:51.965
THERE'S A DEFINITE VALUE. TO

01:42:52.032 --> 01:42:53.800
HAVING REPRESENTATIVES THAT THE

01:42:53.867 --> 01:42:54.902
VOTERS --

01:42:54.968 --> 01:42:56.670
SELECTED TO BE THERE TO

01:42:56.737 --> 01:42:57.604
REPRESENT THEM.

01:42:57.671 --> 01:42:59.206
MOM AND I WOULD I WOULD LEAVE

THE BOARD HAS A VALUE IS A

01:43:01.208 --> 01:43:03.610
DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS BEFORE YOU

01:43:03.677 --> 01:43:05.445
KNOW THE WORKLOAD HAS SHIFTED WE

01:43:05.512 --> 01:43:06.513
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT --

01:43:06.580 --> 01:43:07.748
WE LIVE THROUGH IT SO SO THAT'S

01:43:07.814 --> 01:43:09.182
TRUE.

01:43:09.249 --> 01:43:10.584
BUT I THINK THAT THE DIFFERENCE

01:43:10.651 --> 01:43:11.785

THERE AND AND MAYBE CLARIFY.

01:43:20.294 --> 01:43:22.863
I THINK OUR HISTORICALLY WITHOUT

THE PRIOR BOARD THERE WAS A LOT

01:43:23.564 --> 01:43:24.998

01:43:29.703 --> 01:43:31.471
THREE FORTY BOARD MEETINGS VERY

01:43:31.538 --> 01:43:33.574
LONG DAYS ECCENTRIC CETERA --

01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:35.676

01:43:41.782 --> 01:43:43.016
THAT'S REDUCED FROM WHAT IT WAS

01:43:43.083 --> 01:43:44.351
BEFORE BUT THE COMPLEXITY OF

01:43:44.418 --> 01:43:46.453
PROPERTY TAXES WHAT IS SO

01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:47.921
IMPRESSIVE AN AMAZING.

01:43:47.988 --> 01:43:49.523
AND IT'S NOT COMPLEX JUST FOR

01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:51.191
THE SAKE OF BEING COMPLEX IS

01:43:51.258 --> 01:43:53.160
COMPLEX BECAUSE THE YOU KNOW THE

01:43:53.226 --> 01:43:57.030

SERVICES ARE SO TIGHTLY COUPLED.

01:47:01.948 --> 01:47:02.749
THAT WILL BE MOVED TO ANOTHER

01:47:02.816 --> 01:47:04.217
LOCATION WE'VE GOT TO WORK OUT

01:47:04.284 --> 01:47:05.786
THE LOGISTICS WE CAN DO THAT.

01:47:05.852 --> 01:47:07.454
I THINK THE GREATER ISSUE IS FOR

01:47:07.521 --> 01:47:08.622
THE BOARD MEMBER SPECIFICALLY I

01:47:08.688 --> 01:47:09.723
JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT

01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:11.458
BECAUSE IN WORKING WITH YOU KNOW

01:47:11.525 --> 01:47:12.058
SOME OF THE OTHER AGENCIES I

01:47:12.125 --> 01:47:13.193
THOUGHT ALL OF THE WE WANTED TO

01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:14.294
BE IN THE DOWNTOWN CORE DOOR AND

01:47:14.361 --> 01:47:15.862
IT'S NOT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE

01:47:15.929 --> 01:47:16.563
STAFFING OKAY.

01:47:16.630 --> 01:47:19.566
MOVING TUNA THOMAS BUT THE BOARD

01:47:19.633 --> 01:47:22.736
MEMBERS OFFICIAL TAKE TO

01:47:22.803 --> 01:47:23.904
MAINTAIN THAT SEPARATION BECAUSE

01:47:23.970 --> 01:47:25.172
THAT JUST FROM THE OPTICS YOU

01:47:25.238 --> 01:47:26.673
SEE THAT THE BOARD MEMBERS ARE

01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:27.808
NOT DIRECTLY --

01:47:27.874 --> 01:47:28.909
ENGAGING DAY TODAY WITH THE

01:47:28.975 --> 01:47:30.043
EMPLOYEES.

01:47:30.110 --> 01:47:31.311
I THINK THE GREATER THING

01:47:31.378 --> 01:47:33.547
HOWEVER IS THEIR ROLE --

01:47:33.613 --> 01:47:35.348
WHERE WE FIND THE VALUE OF THE

01:47:35.415 --> 01:47:36.583
BOARD AND AND ONE OF THE OTHER

01:47:36.650 --> 01:47:38.385
LANES IS THEIR ADVOCACY

01:47:38.451 --> 01:47:40.587
SOMETIMES AND IN THIS CASE FOR

01:47:40.654 --> 01:47:41.121
THINGS THAT THE AGENCY IS

01:47:41.188 --> 01:47:42.155
FIGHTING?

01:47:42.222 --> 01:47:43.290
FOR AND SO I THINK AS YOUR

01:47:43.356 --> 01:47:44.357
COLLEAGUES --

01:47:44.424 --> 01:47:45.792
CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS IN YOUR

01:47:45.859 --> 01:47:46.760
COLLEAGUES I THINK THE CLOSE

01:47:46.827 --> 01:47:48.995
PROXIMITY CONSISTENT WITH OTHER --

01:47:49.062 --> 01:47:49.963
ELECTED --

01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:52.032
AND CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS ARM

01:47:52.098 --> 01:47:53.333
ALL ARE DOWN INTO THE DOWNTOWN

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:54.935
LOCATION SO I THINK TO THE

01:47:55.001 --> 01:47:56.136
EXTENT IF I COULD USE FOR THIS

01:47:56.203 --> 01:47:57.637
ANALOGY IF YOU COME TO THE

01:47:57.704 --> 01:47:59.573
CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICER ON TABLE

01:47:59.639 --> 01:48:00.874
IF YOU WILL --

01:48:00.941 --> 01:48:03.410
HAVING A MATTE CLOSE PROXIMITY

01:48:03.476 --> 01:48:04.711
TO BE A PART OF THE STATE WIDE

01:48:04.778 --> 01:48:06.313
POLICY SETTING NOW STATEWIDE

01:48:06.379 --> 01:48:07.781
DISCUSSIONS ON SIGNIFICANT ISSUE

01:48:07.848 --> 01:48:09.449
PROPERTY TAX AND BE TAXING TAKES

01:48:09.516 --> 01:48:10.984
THAT TAXATION BEING ONE OF THEM.

01:48:11.051 --> 01:48:12.919
I THINK THE CLOSE PROXIMITY --

01:48:12.986 --> 01:48:14.054
AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE EASY

01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:16.089
ACCESS TO MANY OF THE STAKE

01:48:16.156 --> 01:48:17.657
HOLDERS THAT ARE VISITING YOUR

01:48:17.724 --> 01:48:19.326
OFFICES COME TO THE TO TO THE

01:48:19.392 --> 01:48:20.927
BOARD'S OFFICES EXCEPT FOR WOULD

01:48:20.994 --> 01:48:22.495
BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL.

01:48:22.562 --> 01:48:23.597
I'M SO I THINK THAT AND JUST

01:48:23.663 --> 01:48:24.531
BASED UPON THE NATURE OF THE

01:48:24.598 --> 01:48:25.932
WORK THAT WE'RE SEEING --

01:48:25.999 --> 01:48:32.272
I THINK IT'S IT'S A FREE GENERAL

01:48:32.339 --> 01:48:34.908
PROXIMITY AND OBSCENITY AS AS AS

01:48:34.975 --> 01:48:36.343
THEIR COLLEAGUES ARE.

01:48:36.409 --> 01:48:38.044
EXCEPTIONAL.

DEEPER DIVE WITH THAT BECAUSE I

01:48:41.514 --> 01:48:43.550
KNOW THAT A MAN OF MY CHAIR WILL

01:48:43.617 --> 01:48:44.217

THANK YOU STATE LAW REQUIRES

01:54:42.609 --> 01:54:44.277
THAT WE WORK TOGETHER IN SEVERAL

01:54:44.344 --> 01:54:46.946
AREAS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED

01:54:47.013 --> 01:54:48.748
TO APPRAISER AND ASSESSMENT

01:54:48.815 --> 01:54:50.283
ANALYST CERTIFICATION.

01:54:50.350 --> 01:54:51.951
AND DEVELOPING STANDARDIZED

01:54:52.018 --> 01:54:54.520
FORMS WE CO ADMINISTER WELFARE

01:54:54.587 --> 01:54:56.623
EXEMPTIONS AND WE'VE EXPANDED

01:54:56.689 --> 01:54:58.591
OUR COLLABORATION INTO OTHER

01:54:58.658 --> 01:55:01.327
AREAS THAT INCLUDE TRAINING AND

01:55:01.394 --> 01:55:02.795
OUR COUNTY SURVEYS.

01:55:02.862 --> 01:55:05.198
IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT IN GENERAL

01:55:05.265 --> 01:55:07.767
OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE BOP HAS

01:55:07.834 --> 01:55:09.102
BEEN GOOD.

01:55:09.168 --> 01:55:10.837
WE'VE HAD SOME ROUGH PATCHES OF

01:55:10.903 --> 01:55:12.205
COURSE ELECTIONS CHANGE THE

01:55:12.272 --> 01:55:14.741
MAKEUP OF OUR ORGANIZATION JUST

01:55:14.807 --> 01:55:16.676
AS THEY CHANGE THE BOARD.

01:55:16.743 --> 01:55:18.411
IN THE END WE'RE ALL WORKING FOR

01:55:18.478 --> 01:55:20.580
THE TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA AND

01:55:20.647 --> 01:55:21.914
I BELIEVE THAT'S THE GREATEST

01:55:21.981 --> 01:55:23.750
STRENGTH OF THE BOARD WHEN THEY

01:55:23.816 --> 01:55:25.251
KEEP THAT FOCUS.

01:55:25.318 --> 01:55:27.053
THE BIGGEST CRITICISM I'VE HEARD

01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:28.755
OF THE BOARD IS THAT MEMBERS

01:55:28.821 --> 01:55:30.223
SOMETIMES ACT AS IF THEY'RE

01:55:30.290 --> 01:55:32.325
BEHOLDEN TO SPECIAL INTERESTS.

01:55:32.392 --> 01:55:34.494
THAT HELP FUND THEIR LAST OR

01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:36.029
THEIR NEXT CAMPAIGN.

01:55:36.095 --> 01:55:36.763
HOWEVER I'VE HEARD THAT

01:55:36.829 --> 01:55:38.398
CRITICISM OF OTHER ELECTED

01:55:38.464 --> 01:55:39.966
OFFICIALS AND I'M REMINDED OF

01:55:40.033 --> 01:55:42.101
THE OLD ADAGE THAT WHEN YOU'RE

01:55:42.168 --> 01:55:43.903
POINTING YOUR FINGER AT SOMEONE.

01:55:43.970 --> 01:55:45.204
THREE FINGERS ARE POINTING BACK

01:55:45.271 --> 01:55:46.572
AT YOU.

01:55:46.639 --> 01:55:47.940
THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA IS

01:55:48.007 --> 01:55:49.709
UNIQUE IN THE NATION WITH AN

01:55:49.776 --> 01:55:51.444
ELECTED BOARD RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:55:51.511 --> 01:55:53.813
ADMINISTERING PROPERTY TAX LAW.

01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:55.348
DOES NOT INHERENTLY CREATE

01:55:55.415 --> 01:55:57.383
PROBLEMS OR MAKE IT BETTER OR

01:55:57.450 --> 01:56:00.186
WORSE AT PERFORMING ITS TASKS.

01:56:00.253 --> 01:56:01.654
THE EFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATION OF

01:56:01.721 --> 01:56:03.690
PROPERTY TAX LAW HAS A DIRECT

01:56:03.756 --> 01:56:06.592
IMPACT ON TAXPAYERS AND NON

01:56:06.659 --> 01:56:08.094
GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTIONS.

01:56:08.161 --> 01:56:09.295
IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A

01:56:09.362 --> 01:56:11.664
PRIORITY BY THE STATE.

01:56:11.731 --> 01:56:14.233
FROM A PUBLIC POLICY STANDPOINT

01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:15.902
TAXPAYERS AND VOTERS HAVE THE

01:56:15.968 --> 01:56:18.771
RIGHT TO EXPECT ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:56:18.838 --> 01:56:20.406
AND FOR THE MOST PART THEY GET

01:56:20.473 --> 01:56:21.741
THAT WHEN THEY CHOOSE THEIR

01:56:21.808 --> 01:56:23.543
REPRESENTATIVES.

01:56:23.609 --> 01:56:25.011
THE CALIFORNIA ASSESSORS

01:56:25.078 --> 01:56:27.680
ASSOCIATION FEELS VERY STRONGLY

01:56:27.747 --> 01:56:28.815
THAT THE BEER WE USE MOST

01:56:28.881 --> 01:56:31.084
IMPORTANT FUNCTION AS AN

01:56:31.150 --> 01:56:32.785
ASSESSMENT AGENCY.

01:56:32.852 --> 01:56:34.620
REQUIRES A VASTLY DIFFERENT

01:56:34.687 --> 01:56:37.924
SKILL SET THAN A TAX AGENCY.

01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:41.494
ATTACKS AGENCY IS CONCERNED AN

01:56:41.561 --> 01:56:42.662
ACCOUNTING.

01:56:42.729 --> 01:56:44.364
AND ASSESSMENT AGENCY IS

01:56:44.430 --> 01:56:46.799
CONCERNED WITH FAIR EQUITABLE

01:56:46.866 --> 01:56:49.102
STANDARDIZED IN UNIFORM

01:56:49.168 --> 01:56:50.903
ASSESSMENT PRACTICES.

01:56:50.970 --> 01:56:52.405
THE TEARS QUESTION COMPARING THE

01:56:52.472 --> 01:56:54.040
BOP TO AN ASSESSMENT APPEALS

01:56:54.107 --> 01:56:55.908
BOARD WOULD TAKE MORE THAN FIVE

01:56:55.975 --> 01:56:57.210
MINUTES TO DISCUSS.

01:56:57.276 --> 01:56:58.911
AND IN MANY WAYS IT'S LIKE

01:56:58.978 --> 01:57:01.147
COMPARING APPLES TO ORANGES.

01:57:01.214 --> 01:57:03.149
AND ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARD IS

01:57:03.216 --> 01:57:05.051
ACQUIRES I JUDICIAL BODY WHOSE

01:57:05.118 --> 01:57:07.487
ONLY FUNCTION IS TO ADJUDICATE A

01:57:07.553 --> 01:57:10.456
DISPUTE BETWEEN A TAXPAYER AND

01:57:10.523 --> 01:57:11.491
THE ASSESSOR'S OFFICE.

01:57:11.557 --> 01:57:14.660
THAT DECISION AFFECTS ONE VALUE%

01:57:14.727 --> 01:57:16.162
ON ONE ASSESSMENT ROLL.

01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:18.131
THE VIDEO IS RESPONSIBILITY IS

01:57:18.197 --> 01:57:20.299
OVERSIGHT STANDARDIZATION AND

01:57:20.366 --> 01:57:21.868
GUIDANCE ON LOCAL ASSESSMENT

01:57:21.934 --> 01:57:23.102
PRACTICES.

01:57:23.169 --> 01:57:26.172
BAD HAS STATE WIDE RAMIFICATIONS.

01:57:26.239 --> 01:57:27.073
THE QUESTION OF MINIMUM

01:57:27.140 --> 01:57:29.041
QUALIFICATIONS IS ONE AREA WHERE

01:57:29.108 --> 01:57:31.944
CA MEMBERS DO NOT HAVE AGREEMENT.

01:57:32.011 --> 01:57:33.679
LIKE YOU.

01:57:33.746 --> 01:57:34.580
MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF

01:57:34.647 --> 01:57:36.682
EQUALIZATION OTHER STATE

01:57:36.749 --> 01:57:38.584
CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS AND EVEN

01:57:38.651 --> 01:57:39.852
ASSESSORS.

01:57:39.919 --> 01:57:41.788

01:57:41.854 --> 01:57:43.689
REGISTERED TO VOTE IN ORDER TO

01:57:43.756 --> 01:57:44.957
HOLD OFFICE.

01:57:45.024 --> 01:57:47.760
IT IS UP TO THE VOTERS TO DECIDE.

01:57:47.827 --> 01:57:49.328
WHO WILL ACT IN THEIR BEST

01:57:49.395 --> 01:57:50.663
INTEREST?

01:57:50.730 --> 01:57:52.465
I THINK WE CAN AGREE ON TRAINING

01:57:52.532 --> 01:57:53.499
IT'S A GOOD THING.

01:57:53.566 --> 01:57:54.967
AND I'M ENCOURAGED BY THE FACT

01:57:55.034 --> 01:57:56.536
THAT THE NEWLY ELECTED BOARD

01:57:56.602 --> 01:57:59.038
MEMBERS HAVE ENGAGED IN TRAINING

01:57:59.105 --> 01:58:00.373
ACTIVITIES AT THEIR FIRST TWO

01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:01.474
BOARD MEETINGS.

01:58:01.541 --> 01:58:02.742
AND THERE ARE CLEARLY READING

01:58:02.809 --> 01:58:04.343
THE ASSESSORS HANDBOOKS.

01:58:04.410 --> 01:58:05.545
BUT I WOULD ADD THAT IT IS

01:58:05.611 --> 01:58:07.613
ALWAYS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS

01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:10.016
SUCCESSORS TO EDUCATE ABOARD

01:58:10.082 --> 01:58:11.551
WHEN THERE IS A DISPUTE.

01:58:11.617 --> 01:58:12.819
OR AN IMPORTANT MATTER THAT

01:58:12.885 --> 01:58:16.422
THERE CAN AN APPEALS BOARD A

01:58:16.489 --> 01:58:18.591
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OR A BOARD

01:58:18.658 --> 01:58:20.026
OF EQUALIZATION.

01:58:20.092 --> 01:58:22.195
ASSESSORS ARE THE SUBJECT MATTER

01:58:22.261 --> 01:58:25.198
EXPERTS OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO

01:58:25.264 --> 01:58:27.099
ENSURE WE PROVIDE BACKGROUND AT

01:58:27.166 --> 01:58:29.168
LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THESE

01:58:29.235 --> 01:58:30.670
DECISIONS WE'VE MADE.

01:58:30.736 --> 01:58:32.972
AS FOR COMPENSATION THAT DEBATE

01:58:33.039 --> 01:58:34.507
COULD TAKE WEEKS AND I'M RUNNING

01:58:34.574 --> 01:58:37.243
OUT OF TIME SO I'LL PASS ON THAT.

01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:38.978
I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT

01:58:39.045 --> 01:58:40.913
MENTION THAT BEER WE STAFF IN

01:58:40.980 --> 01:58:42.482
INTERNAL OPERATIONS HAVE

01:58:42.548 --> 01:58:43.449
SUFFERED.

01:58:43.516 --> 01:58:45.751
AS A RESULT OF A B..

01:58:45.818 --> 01:58:47.620
ONE OH TWO WHEN STAFF IS FACED

01:58:47.687 --> 01:58:49.055
WITH THE TYPE OF UPHEAVAL AND

01:58:49.121 --> 01:58:51.057
UNCERTAINTY BROUGHT ON BY THAT

01:58:51.123 --> 01:58:52.458
MASSIVE IT CHANGE.

01:58:52.525 --> 01:58:54.260
IT AFFECTS PRODUCTIVITY AND

01:58:54.327 --> 01:58:55.628
EFFICIENCY.

01:58:55.695 --> 01:58:57.830
STAFF SALARIES ARE INSUFFICIENT

01:58:57.897 --> 01:58:59.465
TO RETAIN OR ATTRACT THE BEST

01:58:59.532 --> 01:59:00.766
AND THE BRIGHTEST.

01:59:00.833 --> 01:59:02.301
AND THE NEW CONSTRAINTS ON

01:59:02.368 --> 01:59:04.036
HIRING AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE

01:59:04.103 --> 01:59:06.672
DECISIONS HAVE ESSENTIALLY

01:59:06.739 --> 01:59:08.074
HANDCUFF THE AGENCY.

01:59:08.140 --> 01:59:09.742
THE BOP HAS LOST ITS

01:59:09.809 --> 01:59:11.210
ORGANIZATIONAL MEMORY AND I

01:59:11.277 --> 01:59:12.979
BELIEVE THAT WILL HAVE LONG TERM

01:59:13.045 --> 01:59:17.016
NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES.

01:59:17.083 --> 01:59:19.051
WE HAVE ABOUT ONE MINUTE MA'AM.

01:59:19.118 --> 01:59:20.620
THANK YOU I THINK I CAN DO THAT

01:59:20.686 --> 01:59:21.854
BUT I'LL JUST TALK FAST.

01:59:21.921 --> 01:59:23.389
WE BELIEVE THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO

01:59:23.456 --> 01:59:24.891
EXPECT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

01:59:24.957 --> 01:59:27.126
OF PROPERTY TAX LAWS INDEPENDENT

01:59:27.193 --> 01:59:29.328
TRANSPARENT FAIR EQUITABLE

01:59:29.395 --> 01:59:31.531
NONPARTISAN AND ACCESSIBLE.

01:59:31.597 --> 01:59:32.832
THE STRAIGHT SHOULD BE TRUE OF

01:59:32.899 --> 01:59:34.166
LOCAL ASSESSOR'S AS WELL AS A

01:59:34.233 --> 01:59:37.336
STATE AGENCY THAT OVERSEES AND

01:59:37.403 --> 01:59:38.571
ASSESS THEIR OFFICES.

01:59:38.638 --> 01:59:39.438
ANY CHANGES IN THE

01:59:39.505 --> 01:59:40.773
ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE

01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:41.474
CAREFULLY AND THOROUGHLY

01:59:41.541 --> 01:59:43.175
REVIEWED.

01:59:43.242 --> 01:59:45.578
THE ASSOCIATION DOES NOT HAVE AN

01:59:45.645 --> 01:59:48.247
OFFICIAL POSITION ON A CA.

01:59:48.314 --> 01:59:49.515
TO AS THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION

IS THE PRINCIPAL REGULATORY

01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:53.185
AGENCY OVERSEEING THE PRACTICES

01:59:53.252 --> 01:59:54.854

NEUTRAL REGARDING ISSOLUTION

01:59:58.391 --> 01:59:58.824
IT'D BE --

01:59:58.891 --> 02:00:00.760
WE IN ORDER TO AVOID ANY

02:00:00.826 --> 02:00:01.327
APPEARANCE OF CONFLICT OF

02:00:01.394 --> 02:00:02.295
INTEREST.

02:00:02.361 --> 02:00:04.430
HAVING SAID THAT WE STRONGLY

THE BORDER NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN

02:00:07.867 --> 02:00:09.402
UNIFORMITY ACROSS THE STATE.

02:00:09.468 --> 02:00:10.436
WE BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

02:00:10.503 --> 02:00:12.972
THOSE DUTIES DO NOT GET LOST IN

02:00:13.039 --> 02:00:14.840
THE SHUFFLE.

02:00:14.907 --> 02:00:16.709
THIS WILL BE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT

02:00:16.776 --> 02:00:19.078
IF ACA TO EMMA SPLIT ROLE

THIRTEEN PASSED.

02:00:29.889 --> 02:00:31.424

02:00:39.065 --> 02:00:40.666
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.

02:00:40.733 --> 02:00:43.703
I WOULD EXPECT SIMILAR CHAOS IF

02:00:43.769 --> 02:00:45.438
WE FOUND OURSELVES DEALING WITH

02:00:45.504 --> 02:00:47.373

02:01:38.691 --> 02:01:39.725
SO I'M GONNA TRY TO PICK UP

02:01:39.792 --> 02:01:40.893
SPECIFICALLY.

02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:42.828
ON SOME OF THOSE BUT JUST AS A

02:01:42.895 --> 02:01:44.063
MATTER OF BACKGROUND.

02:01:44.130 --> 02:01:45.231
WAS THIRTY THREE YEARS IN THE

02:01:45.297 --> 02:01:48.501
ASSESSOR'S OFFICE ACTED FUNCTION.

WORK THAT I DID SEXY --

02:01:56.842 --> 02:01:57.877
AND WOULD TAKE --

02:01:57.943 --> 02:02:00.179
ISSUE TO THE FACT THAT PROPERTY

02:02:00.246 --> 02:02:02.515
TAXES OR ANYTHING BUT SEXY.

02:02:02.581 --> 02:02:05.551
AND I THINK THAT'S CRITICAL

02:02:05.618 --> 02:02:06.652
BECAUSE I THINK WHAT.

02:02:06.719 --> 02:02:08.421
THE TAXPAYERS DESERVE WHAT THE

02:02:08.487 --> 02:02:11.090
PEOPLE DESERVE --

02:02:11.157 --> 02:02:13.392
NOT NECESSARILY TO POINT TO ME

02:02:13.459 --> 02:02:15.494
BUT TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW WHAT

02:02:15.561 --> 02:02:17.663
YOU REALLY WANT IS SOMEBODY THAT

02:02:17.730 --> 02:02:19.699
IS SO COMMITTED AND DEDICATED

02:02:19.765 --> 02:02:22.168

PROPERTY TAXATION DAD DAY BECOME

02:02:25.137 --> 02:02:26.939
A STUDENT OF IT THAT THEY STUDY

02:02:27.006 --> 02:02:28.674
IT THEY BECOME A SUBJECT MATTER

02:02:28.741 --> 02:02:29.608
EXPERT.

02:02:29.675 --> 02:02:31.711
AND THEY DEVELOP A LEVEL OF

02:02:31.777 --> 02:02:33.479
EXCERPT CURTICE.

02:02:33.546 --> 02:02:35.548
THAT IS ON COMPROMISE A BALL NOW

02:02:35.614 --> 02:02:37.283
I WILL SAY TO MISS DAVIS THAT

02:02:37.349 --> 02:02:39.685
SHE AND I CO TAUGHT MANY YEARS

02:02:39.752 --> 02:02:42.321
AGO THE ONE AND ONLY ETHICS

02:02:42.388 --> 02:02:45.157
CLASS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:02:45.224 --> 02:02:45.891
FOR ASSESSORS.

02:02:45.958 --> 02:02:47.827
AND WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE

02:02:47.893 --> 02:02:49.829
ASKING FOR TODAY.

02:02:49.895 --> 02:02:51.263
I WOULD POINT TO A COUPLE OF

02:02:51.330 --> 02:02:52.364
THINGS THAT I THINK ARE VERY

02:02:52.431 --> 02:02:55.167
IMPORTANT. ONE IS THAT THE

02:02:55.234 --> 02:02:56.869
NATURE OF WHAT IS THE BOARD OF

02:02:56.936 --> 02:02:58.838
EQUALIZATION BUT THE BOARD OF

02:02:58.904 --> 02:03:00.840
EQUALIZATION WAS SOMETHING THAT

02:03:00.906 --> 02:03:02.208
BEGAN AS YOU'VE HEARD OVER AND

02:03:02.274 --> 02:03:03.876
OVER OVER A HUNDRED AND FORTY

02:03:03.943 --> 02:03:05.244
YEARS AGO --

02:03:05.311 --> 02:03:06.846
AND IT WAS THE PURPOSE WAS TO

02:03:06.912 --> 02:03:09.115
EQUALIZE THE ASSESSMENT BETWEEN

02:03:09.181 --> 02:03:11.484
OR CROSS COUNTIES FOR THAT

02:03:11.550 --> 02:03:12.985
COUNTIES HAD THE SAME LEVEL.

02:03:13.052 --> 02:03:14.754
SINCE PROP THIRTEEN THAT'S GONE

02:03:14.820 --> 02:03:16.689
WE DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE WHAT WE

02:03:16.756 --> 02:03:18.624
TRY TO DO REALLY INSTEAD OF

02:03:18.691 --> 02:03:21.494
EQUALIZATION IS UNIFORMITY.

02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:22.762
AND THAT'S REALLY MORE TODAY

02:03:22.828 --> 02:03:24.330
WHAT THE FUNCTION OF THE BOARD

02:03:24.396 --> 02:03:26.198
IS LET ME READ TO YOU THE

02:03:26.265 --> 02:03:27.533
MISSION STATEMENT OF THE BOARD

02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:29.468
AND SEE IF YOU CAN.

02:03:29.535 --> 02:03:31.737
GATHER FROM THIS THE CONNECTION

02:03:31.804 --> 02:03:33.706
THAT THE PUBLIC. TO WHAT THEIR

02:03:33.773 --> 02:03:34.974
FUNCTION IS TO THEIR MISSION

02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:36.041
STATEMENT.

02:03:36.108 --> 02:03:36.642
THE MISSION STATEMENT OF THE

02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:39.044
BOARD OF VEHICLES TO SERVE THE

02:03:39.111 --> 02:03:41.781
PUBLIC THROUGH FAIR AFFECT OF AN

02:03:41.847 --> 02:03:42.982
EFFICIENT TAX ADMINISTRATION.

02:03:43.048 --> 02:03:44.817
WHAT'S THAT.

02:03:44.884 --> 02:03:46.385
WHAT WE HAVE TODAY IS A

02:03:46.452 --> 02:03:47.987
DISCONNECT IN SOME MEASURE

02:03:48.053 --> 02:03:50.322
BETWEEN EITHER THE?

02:03:50.389 --> 02:03:51.991
PEOPLE THAT ELECTED BY MEMBERS

02:03:52.057 --> 02:03:53.659
OF THE BOARD EXHORTATION AND

02:03:53.726 --> 02:03:55.494
WHAT THEIR FUNCTIONS ARE.

02:03:55.561 --> 02:03:56.629
AND I THINK THERE'S A GREAT

02:03:56.695 --> 02:03:59.431
OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR US AS A

02:03:59.498 --> 02:04:02.001
STATE FOR YOU TO LOOK AT HOW DO

02:04:02.067 --> 02:04:03.869
YOU MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS.

02:04:03.936 --> 02:04:06.105
THERE ARE PROS AND CONS TO BOTH

02:04:06.172 --> 02:04:08.774
HAVING ELECTIVES AND APPOINTED

02:04:08.841 --> 02:04:11.343
OR NON ELECTIVES IN --

02:04:11.410 --> 02:04:13.546
THE CAPACITY OF THE BOARD OF

02:04:13.612 --> 02:04:14.847
EQUALIZATION OF WHAT THE ROLE IS

02:04:14.914 --> 02:04:15.881
IT'S MY OPINION THAT YOU CAN

02:04:15.948 --> 02:04:17.082
HAVE BOTH.

02:04:17.149 --> 02:04:18.350
AND I THINK --

02:04:18.417 --> 02:04:20.553
AT LEAST SINCE THE TIME OF PROP

02:04:20.619 --> 02:04:22.154
THIRTEEN THAT WE KNOW A LOT MORE

02:04:22.221 --> 02:04:25.191
ABOUT PROPERTY TAXES THAT WE DID.

02:04:25.257 --> 02:04:27.126
AND THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY

02:04:27.193 --> 02:04:28.460
FOR US TO BUILD THAT STRUCTURE

02:04:28.527 --> 02:04:30.262
SOMETHING THAT'S VERY HARD TO DO

02:04:30.329 --> 02:04:33.332
WITH ELECTED BUT IT IS EASY TO

02:04:33.399 --> 02:04:34.934
DO TO BUILD STRUCTURE.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:36.902
ETHICS AND STANDARDS WHEN YOU'RE

02:04:36.969 --> 02:04:39.004
NOT DEALING WITH ELECTED

02:04:39.071 --> 02:04:40.906
CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS.

02:04:40.973 --> 02:04:42.875
OUT OF SENATOR NIELSEN WITH

02:04:42.942 --> 02:04:45.144
REGARD TO YOUR QUESTION ON

02:04:45.211 --> 02:04:46.879
PROPOSITION THIRTEEN AND LET'S

02:04:46.946 --> 02:04:48.781
SAY THE VULNERABILITY THAT IT

02:04:48.848 --> 02:04:50.282
JUST BLOWS --

02:04:50.349 --> 02:04:52.351
TO WITH SPECIFICALLY TO THE

02:04:52.418 --> 02:04:53.452
SPLIT ROLE IT'S BEEN MY

02:04:53.519 --> 02:04:55.421
OBSERVATION THAT WHEN THESE

02:04:55.487 --> 02:04:57.056
THINGS HAPPEN AND BEAR IN MIND

02:04:57.122 --> 02:04:59.091
THE SO CALLED CORRUPTION THAT

02:04:59.158 --> 02:05:00.459
HAVE TAKEN PLACE.

02:05:00.526 --> 02:05:01.961
WITH THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION

02:05:02.027 --> 02:05:03.329
WHETHER ITS RECENT OR IN THE

02:05:03.395 --> 02:05:05.231
PAST HAS BEEN CYCLICAL FOR THE

02:05:05.297 --> 02:05:07.199
WHOLE PERIOD OF TIME FOR THE

02:05:07.266 --> 02:05:07.900
HUNDRED FORTY YEARS.

02:05:07.967 --> 02:05:10.002
WELL THAT'S NOTHING NEW AND YOU

02:05:10.069 --> 02:05:11.670
KNOW REALITY IS YOU GOTTA GO

02:05:11.737 --> 02:05:13.505
THROUGH IT AGAIN YES WOULD YOU

02:05:13.572 --> 02:05:14.740
GO THROUGH IT AGAIN IF IT'S

02:05:14.807 --> 02:05:18.043
ELECTED OR APPOINTED.

02:05:18.110 --> 02:05:18.844
PROBABLY YES.

02:05:18.911 --> 02:05:19.478
BUT YOU CAN BUILD CONTROLS IN

02:05:19.545 --> 02:05:21.280
THE APPOINTED POSITIONS THAT YOU

02:05:21.347 --> 02:05:22.615
CAN'T DO IN THE ELECTED

02:05:22.681 --> 02:05:23.716
POSITIONS.

02:05:23.782 --> 02:05:25.451
AND WE HAVE ALL THE EXPERIENCE

02:05:25.517 --> 02:05:27.419
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW DO WE DO

02:05:27.486 --> 02:05:29.488
THAT NOW IN TERMS OF BUILDING

02:05:29.555 --> 02:05:31.457
THAT STRUCTURE CREATING ETHICS

02:05:31.523 --> 02:05:33.025
CREATING STANDARDS CREATING

02:05:33.092 --> 02:05:34.593
TRAINING IT CETERA.

02:05:34.660 --> 02:05:37.062
THAT MAY BE ABSENT IN THE IN THE

02:05:37.129 --> 02:05:39.231
CONTEXT OF ELECTIVES NOW WITH

02:05:39.298 --> 02:05:41.300
REGARD TO WHEN DOES THAT HAPPEN

02:05:41.367 --> 02:05:42.234
WHEN.

02:05:42.301 --> 02:05:45.337
YOU GET A PROPOSITION THIRTEEN

02:05:45.404 --> 02:05:47.139
ROLL IT HAPPENS WHEN THERE'S A

02:05:47.206 --> 02:05:49.108
DEFICIENCY WHEN THE VOTERS LOOK

02:05:49.174 --> 02:05:50.442
AND SAY THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG

02:05:50.509 --> 02:05:52.177
WITH TAXATION BE IT PROPERTY

02:05:52.244 --> 02:05:53.245
TAXATION.

02:05:53.312 --> 02:05:55.147
AND THEY SAY IF THE LEGISLATURE

02:05:55.214 --> 02:05:56.282
OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION

02:05:56.348 --> 02:05:57.950
WHOMEVER IS NOT WILLING TO

02:05:58.017 --> 02:05:58.951
CHANGE IT.

02:05:59.018 --> 02:06:00.252
AND WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE IT SO

02:06:00.319 --> 02:06:02.154
IT'S REALLY A CANARY IN THE COAL

02:06:02.221 --> 02:06:04.490
MINE. ONE OF THE MOLES IN MY

02:06:04.556 --> 02:06:06.191
OBSERVATION OF MY TENURE AS AN

02:06:06.258 --> 02:06:08.427

OF THE BOARD IN THE PAST AND

MEMBERS OF BOARD. FOR NEARLY

02:06:18.671 --> 02:06:20.372
THIRTY YEARS --

02:06:20.439 --> 02:06:24.843
AND I'VE HAD THE THE BENEFIT OF

02:06:24.910 --> 02:06:25.878
BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT

02:06:25.945 --> 02:06:27.079
LEGISLATIVE THINGS THAT HAVE

02:06:27.146 --> 02:06:28.714
BEEN IDEAS THAT I'VE BROUGHT

02:06:28.781 --> 02:06:30.516
FORWARD I'VE HAD COURT CASES GO

02:06:30.582 --> 02:06:31.784
UP THROUGH THE COURT OF APPEALS

02:06:31.850 --> 02:06:33.953
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA --

02:06:34.019 --> 02:06:35.988
I'VE TAUGHT ME MANY DIFFERENT

02:06:36.055 --> 02:06:37.423
SESSIONS AT CETERA BUT

02:06:37.489 --> 02:06:38.958
SPECIFICALLY WHEN WE LOOK AT

02:06:39.024 --> 02:06:42.361
WHAT HAPPENS THE VOTERS REACT

02:06:42.428 --> 02:06:42.828
WHEN IT'S NOT WORKING

02:06:42.895 --> 02:06:43.395
EFFICIENTLY.

02:06:43.462 --> 02:06:45.164
AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT PROPERTY

02:06:45.230 --> 02:06:48.801
TAXES TODAY AND ONE OF THE

02:06:48.867 --> 02:06:50.536
DYNAMICS BETWEEN THE BOARD OF

02:06:50.602 --> 02:06:53.105
EQUALIZATION IN THE ASSESSORS.

02:06:53.172 --> 02:06:54.440
IT'S SOMETIMES RAISES THE

02:06:54.506 --> 02:06:56.642
QUESTION IS THE BOARD REACTIVE

02:06:56.709 --> 02:06:59.144
OR THEY PROACTIVE OR THEY

02:06:59.211 --> 02:07:00.813
CONFLICT ADVERSE.

02:07:00.879 --> 02:07:03.115
DO THEY REACT TO THEIR

02:07:03.182 --> 02:07:05.184
CONSTITUENTS OR THE INFLUENCE

02:07:05.250 --> 02:07:07.653
THAT'S UPON THEM AND WITH REGARD

02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:08.954
TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

02:07:09.021 --> 02:07:11.590
ASSESSORS. FOR INTERESTED

02:07:11.657 --> 02:07:13.192
PARTIES AND THE BOARD OF

02:07:13.258 --> 02:07:15.127
EQUALIZATION WHILE PROVISION IS

02:07:15.194 --> 02:07:17.029
BEEN THAT THEY'VE ACTED MORE

02:07:17.096 --> 02:07:19.999
ARBITRATORS ARE MEDIATORS THAN A

02:07:20.065 --> 02:07:21.533
TAXPAYING AUTHORITY.

02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:23.035
AND THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE AND

02:07:23.102 --> 02:07:24.703
I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY

02:07:24.770 --> 02:07:26.372
TO MOVE AWAY FROM THAT IN ONE

02:07:26.438 --> 02:07:27.806
PROBABLY CLOSE SO I'M GONNA

02:07:27.873 --> 02:07:29.875
LEAVE IT FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT

02:07:29.942 --> 02:07:32.044

02:12:32.944 --> 02:12:33.979
CHANGE THE STRUCTURE OF THE

02:12:34.046 --> 02:12:35.514
BOARD OF EQUALIZATION.

02:12:35.580 --> 02:12:38.050
WE ASK THAT THE PROGRAMS WITHIN

02:12:38.116 --> 02:12:40.152
THE B. O. E. BE TRANSFERRED

02:12:40.218 --> 02:12:42.020
INTACT BUT THE PROGRAMS NOT BE

02:12:42.087 --> 02:12:43.922
BROKEN UP IN SEGMENT INTO

02:12:43.989 --> 02:12:45.090
DIFFERENT AGENCIES.

02:12:45.157 --> 02:12:47.459
THE SECOND IS WE ASK THAT THE

02:12:47.526 --> 02:12:49.661
NOTICE ON ANY INFORMATION BE

02:12:49.728 --> 02:12:52.531
PROVIDED TO TAXPAYERS IN ADVANCE.

02:12:52.597 --> 02:12:54.066
TO MITIGATE ANY DISRUPTION IN

02:12:54.132 --> 02:12:55.801
COMPLIANCE DURING THE TRANSITION

02:12:55.867 --> 02:12:56.935
PROCESS.

02:12:57.002 --> 02:12:58.503
AND ALSO FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

02:12:58.570 --> 02:12:59.771
CONSIDER SOME KIND OF

02:12:59.838 --> 02:13:02.274
TRANSITIONAL SAFE HAVEN SO THAT

02:13:02.341 --> 02:13:04.242
TAXPAYERS NOT PENALIZED IF THEY

02:13:04.309 --> 02:13:05.577
MISSED DEADLINES BECAUSE THERE'S

02:13:05.644 --> 02:13:07.512
A NEW MAILING ADDRESS OR THERE'S

02:13:07.579 --> 02:13:09.981
A NEW CHANGE IN POLICY PROCEDURE.

02:13:10.048 --> 02:13:11.350
BUT WE ALSO HAVE THREE VERY

02:13:11.416 --> 02:13:12.184
IMPORTANT SPECIFIC

02:13:12.250 --> 02:13:14.052
RECOMMENDATIONS TO CONSIDER.

02:13:14.119 --> 02:13:16.355
THE FIRST IS THAT STATE ASSESSED

02:13:16.421 --> 02:13:18.657
REMAIN CENTRALIZED AT THE STATE

02:13:18.724 --> 02:13:19.458
LEVEL.

02:13:19.524 --> 02:13:21.159
NOT ONCE AGAINST GOES TO

02:13:21.226 --> 02:13:23.595
POLICIES THAT ASSESS.

02:13:23.662 --> 02:13:25.163
THESE DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES SUCH

02:13:25.230 --> 02:13:26.998
AS RAILROADS UTILITIES AND

02:13:27.065 --> 02:13:28.433
TELECOMMUNICATIONS THAT HAVE

02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:30.369
CABLES AND WROTE TRACKS THAT RUN

02:13:30.435 --> 02:13:31.737
ACROSS ALL THE DIFFERENT.

02:13:31.803 --> 02:13:33.672
COUNTIES CENTRALIZATION WAS

02:13:33.739 --> 02:13:35.474
IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT ONE

02:13:35.540 --> 02:13:37.142
ENTITY CAN PROVIDE GREATER

02:13:37.209 --> 02:13:38.577
UNIFORMITY.

02:13:38.643 --> 02:13:41.880
AND THAT'S VER IMPORTANT FOR

02:13:41.947 --> 02:13:43.548
AFTER STATES CAN YOU IMAGINE A

02:13:43.615 --> 02:13:45.283
FLOCK TRICITY ONE OUT.

02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:46.485
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF A RAILROAD

02:13:46.551 --> 02:13:47.953
STOP WORKING AND NOT ABLE TO

02:13:48.019 --> 02:13:49.488
TRANSPORT GOODS OUR

02:13:49.554 --> 02:13:51.156
TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS WERE

02:13:51.223 --> 02:13:52.224
UNABLE TO WORK BECAUSE OF

02:13:52.290 --> 02:13:53.658
DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT ROLLS AND

02:13:53.725 --> 02:13:55.093
THERE IS A POSSIBLE LEAD DATE AS

02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:57.195
WELL WORD THE ASSESSMENT HAS TO

02:13:57.262 --> 02:13:58.864
BE DONE BY A CERTAIN TIME IN

02:13:58.930 --> 02:13:59.564
ORDER.

02:13:59.631 --> 02:14:01.967
TO EVALUATE AS THAT THOSE

02:14:02.033 --> 02:14:02.267
PROPERTIES.

02:14:02.334 --> 02:14:04.035
THE SECOND IS TO CONTINUE THE

02:14:04.102 --> 02:14:06.004
REGULATORY GUIDANCE AT THE STATE

02:14:06.071 --> 02:14:06.538
CURRENTLY PROVIDES TO THE

02:14:06.605 --> 02:14:08.206
ASSESSOR.

02:14:08.273 --> 02:14:09.875
THAT PROMOTES UNIFORMITY BUT

02:14:09.941 --> 02:14:12.043
ALSO HELPS TO AVOID COSTLY

02:14:12.110 --> 02:14:14.913
LITIGATION BETWEEN TAXPAYERS AS

02:14:14.980 --> 02:14:16.481
WELL AS COUNTY ASSESSORS.

02:14:16.548 --> 02:14:18.717
AND WE ALSO ASK THE LEGISLATURE

02:14:18.784 --> 02:14:20.152
TO CONSIDER HAVING THE BILL WE

02:14:20.218 --> 02:14:22.587
PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL TRAINING --

02:14:22.654 --> 02:14:24.589
IN SUPPORT OF THE ASSESSORS

02:14:24.656 --> 02:14:26.625
NEWLY ELECTED ASSESSORS HAVE THE

02:14:26.691 --> 02:14:28.560
CA BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THERE CAN

02:14:28.627 --> 02:14:29.661
BE SOME ADDITIONAL TRAINING

02:14:29.728 --> 02:14:31.129
SUPPORT THAT THE STATE CAN

02:14:31.196 --> 02:14:32.564
PROVIDE TO THESE ASSESSORS.

02:14:32.631 --> 02:14:35.700
IT'S A VERY BIG COMPLEX AREA.

02:14:35.767 --> 02:14:37.669
AND IT'S AN AREA WHERE IT LAST

02:14:37.736 --> 02:14:39.971
YEAR IN A VOTE ME SOME NEW

02:14:40.038 --> 02:14:41.239
ASSESSORS --

02:14:41.306 --> 02:14:43.508
SENT SOME ILLEGAL THREATENING

02:14:43.575 --> 02:14:45.243
LETTERS TO TAXPAYERS OF

02:14:45.310 --> 02:14:46.645
THREATENING IMPRISONMENT IF

02:14:46.711 --> 02:14:48.046
TAXPAYERS DID NOT PROVIDES

02:14:48.113 --> 02:14:50.549
QUESTIONNAIRES. TO THE CAA'S

02:14:50.615 --> 02:14:52.751
CREDIT THEY DID POLICE AND THEY

02:14:52.818 --> 02:14:54.553
DID CORRECT THOSE ACTIONS BUT I

02:14:54.619 --> 02:14:56.087
THINK THAT JUST DEMONSTRATES THE

02:14:56.154 --> 02:14:57.656
FACT THAT THERE IS ADDITIONAL

02:14:57.722 --> 02:14:59.090
TRAINING AND NATIONAL WORK THAT

02:14:59.157 --> 02:15:00.025
CAN.

02:15:00.091 --> 02:15:02.093
BE MITIGATED AND CAN BE

02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:03.562
INCREASED BETWEEN THE BOARD OF

02:15:03.628 --> 02:15:05.964
EQUALIZATION AND THE ASSESSORS.

02:15:06.031 --> 02:15:08.600
AND WITH THAT WE APPRECIATE YOUR

02:15:08.667 --> 02:15:09.935
TIME AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:15:10.001 --> 02:15:12.037

THANK YOU FOR TAKING SO MUCH

02:15:19.578 --> 02:15:20.679

THIRTEEN WHICH HAPPENS TO

SINCE THAT TIME WE'VE BEEN WE'VE

02:16:09.728 --> 02:16:11.596
HAD EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WORKING

02:16:11.663 --> 02:16:12.230
WITH THE BOARD ON A WIDE RANGE

02:16:12.297 --> 02:16:13.431
OF ISSUES.

02:16:13.498 --> 02:16:14.599
INCLUDING THOSE THAT USED TO BE

02:16:14.666 --> 02:16:15.634
UNDER THEIR PURVIEW AS WELL AS

02:16:15.700 --> 02:16:17.135
OF COURSE PROPERTY TAX WHICH

02:16:17.202 --> 02:16:18.870
REMAINS UNDER THEIR JURISDICTION

02:16:18.937 --> 02:16:20.038
TO DATE.

02:16:20.105 --> 02:16:21.740
THERE'S YOUR PROPERTY TAXES ONE

02:16:21.806 --> 02:16:22.841
THAT HAS BEEN A PRIORITY FOR C.

02:16:22.908 --> 02:16:24.809
T. OR A AND HAS BEEN SINCE THE

02:16:24.876 --> 02:16:26.177
ORGANIZATION'S INCEPTION AND

02:16:26.244 --> 02:16:27.445
BACKED AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED

02:16:27.512 --> 02:16:28.380
TODAY --

02:16:28.446 --> 02:16:29.581
WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE

02:16:29.648 --> 02:16:30.749
PROPERTY TAX REFORM MEASURE

02:16:30.815 --> 02:16:32.584
CURRENTLY ON THE TWENTY TWENTY

02:16:32.651 --> 02:16:34.085
BALLOT A AND ARE QUITE AWARE AND

02:16:34.152 --> 02:16:35.453
I'M I'M A BELIEVER THE POINT OF

02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:36.488
OF SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF HOW

02:16:36.555 --> 02:16:37.889
THAT THAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED

02:16:37.956 --> 02:16:38.623
IF PASSED.

02:16:38.690 --> 02:16:40.792
BY GIVEN POTENTIAL CHANGES TO

02:16:40.859 --> 02:16:41.860
THE B. O. E..

02:16:41.927 --> 02:16:43.728
AS CONTROLLER HE INDICATED THIS

02:16:43.795 --> 02:16:44.896
CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING TODAY

02:16:44.963 --> 02:16:46.431
IS NOT A NEW ONE I BELIEVE THE

02:16:46.498 --> 02:16:47.532
FIRST CALLS FOR DISBANDING THE

02:16:47.599 --> 02:16:49.301
PO WE ACTUALLY BEGAN RIGHT AFTER

02:16:49.367 --> 02:16:52.170
IT WAS FORMED IN ABOUT.

02:16:52.237 --> 02:16:52.804
NINETY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE BUT

02:16:52.871 --> 02:16:53.939
SINCE NINETEEN FORTY THREE THE

02:16:54.005 --> 02:16:55.206
LEGISLATURE'S BUDGET ADVISER

02:16:55.273 --> 02:16:56.875
EVEN HAS RECOMMENDED GETTING RID

02:16:56.942 --> 02:16:58.710
OF IT ENTIRELY --

02:16:58.777 --> 02:16:59.878
UNFORTUNATELY AND THIS HAS BEEN

02:16:59.945 --> 02:17:01.479
WELL DOCUMENTED AND AND IT I

02:17:01.546 --> 02:17:02.547
HOPE THE GENTLEMAN HAD MENTIONED

02:17:02.614 --> 02:17:04.115
EARLIER THAT PSYCHOLOGICAL IN

02:17:04.182 --> 02:17:05.650
NATURE THE BEER WE AS LONG BEEN

02:17:05.717 --> 02:17:07.152
A SOURCE OF NEPOTISM SCANDAL AND

02:17:07.218 --> 02:17:09.654
AND EFFICIENCY FOR REALLY

02:17:09.721 --> 02:17:10.722
GENERATIONS --

02:17:10.789 --> 02:17:12.190
THE JURY'S LONG BEEN CRITICAL OF

02:17:12.257 --> 02:17:13.391
THE ADJUDICATORY FUNCTION OF THE

02:17:13.458 --> 02:17:15.060
BEER WE BOTH ITS BASIC STRUCTURE

02:17:15.126 --> 02:17:19.464
AND HOW IT'S IMPLEMENTED --

02:17:19.531 --> 02:17:20.065
THIS LEGISLATION HAS SUPPORTED

02:17:20.131 --> 02:17:23.234
AND TO THAT END WE WERE VERY

02:17:23.301 --> 02:17:24.836
ACTIVE IN SUPPORTING AND WORKED

02:17:24.903 --> 02:17:26.805
DILIGENTLY TO PASS A B. ONE OH

02:17:26.871 --> 02:17:27.372
TWO IN THE LAST LEGISLATIVE

02:17:27.439 --> 02:17:28.707
CYCLE -- OF

02:17:28.773 --> 02:17:29.774
COURSE THAT MEASURE COULD ONLY

02:17:29.841 --> 02:17:30.709
GO SO FAR GIVEN THE

02:17:30.775 --> 02:17:32.077
CONSTITUTIONAL NATURE OF THE

02:17:32.143 --> 02:17:33.745
BOARDS ELECTED POSITIONS AND

02:17:33.812 --> 02:17:35.747
THUS WE ARE HERE TODAY --

02:17:35.814 --> 02:17:36.748
THERE ARE SOME WHO WOULD SUGGEST

02:17:36.815 --> 02:17:38.250
THAT THE BE A WE NO LONGER HAS

02:17:38.316 --> 02:17:40.185
FUNCTION OR PURPOSE IN FACT I

02:17:40.251 --> 02:17:41.319
CAN TELL YOU MUCH TO MY

02:17:41.386 --> 02:17:43.088
TERRIFYING DISMAY I WAS WATCHING

02:17:43.154 --> 02:17:44.923
ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND TWITTER IN

02:17:44.990 --> 02:17:46.858
OTHER PLACES AS EVEN HIGH LEVEL --

02:17:46.925 --> 02:17:48.560
DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN PARTY

02:17:48.627 --> 02:17:50.161
OFFICIALS WERE SUGGESTING WHO TO

02:17:50.228 --> 02:17:51.096
VOTE FOR IN THE UPCOMING

02:17:51.162 --> 02:17:53.031
ELECTION CYCLE AND SOME SENSE

02:17:53.098 --> 02:17:54.399
SAID SIMPLY LEAVE THE BE --

02:17:54.466 --> 02:17:56.301
WE BLANK THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING

02:17:56.368 --> 02:17:57.836
ANYWAY --

02:17:57.902 --> 02:17:59.004
HOWEVER I CAN ASSURE YOU THERE

02:17:59.070 --> 02:18:00.271
ARE STILL SOME VERY CRITICAL

02:18:00.338 --> 02:18:01.706
FUNCTIONS THAT REGARDLESS OF THE

02:18:01.773 --> 02:18:03.375
FATE OF AN ELECTED OR APPOINTED

02:18:03.441 --> 02:18:05.110
BOARD OR STRUCTURE MUST BE

02:18:05.176 --> 02:18:06.211
PRESERVED --

02:18:06.277 --> 02:18:07.512
I THINK THE NUMBER MENTION WAS

02:18:07.579 --> 02:18:08.546
FIVE POINT SEVEN TRILLION IN

02:18:08.613 --> 02:18:09.914
PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENTS WITH

02:18:09.981 --> 02:18:11.716
OVER SIXTY BILLION OF THAT GOING

02:18:11.783 --> 02:18:14.119
TO THE GENERAL FUND A YEAR --

02:18:14.185 --> 02:18:15.620
I'VE BEEN AROUND DOING ERROR OF

02:18:15.687 --> 02:18:16.554
THAT -- IS

02:18:16.621 --> 02:18:18.623
FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT FOR THE WORK

02:18:18.690 --> 02:18:19.824
OF THIS BODY --

02:18:19.891 --> 02:18:21.793
SO REGARDLESS WE BELIEVE THAT

02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:23.361
THE FUNCTIONS OF THE BOARD MUST

02:18:23.428 --> 02:18:24.496
BE PRESERVED THE FUNCTIONS OF

02:18:24.562 --> 02:18:26.197
THE AGENCY MUST BE PRESERVED AND

02:18:26.264 --> 02:18:27.732
IN PARTICULAR THE COUPLE HUNDRED

02:18:27.799 --> 02:18:30.068
DEDICATED CIVIL SERVANTS.

02:18:30.135 --> 02:18:30.702
WHO WORK ON THESE ISSUES SHOULD

02:18:30.769 --> 02:18:33.138
BE PRESERVED AND NOT FORGOTTEN

02:18:33.204 --> 02:18:35.573
AS THESE CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE --

02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:36.574
TO SENATOR BELLS COMMENTS

02:18:36.641 --> 02:18:38.343
EARLIER MADE REGARDING THE GAS

02:18:38.410 --> 02:18:40.645
TAX VOTE I THINK THAT'S A GREAT

02:18:40.712 --> 02:18:41.680
EXAMPLE OF EVEN WITH THE

02:18:41.746 --> 02:18:42.814
REDUCTION IN THE SCOPE OF

02:18:42.881 --> 02:18:44.582
RESPONSIBILITIES THE POTENTIAL

02:18:44.649 --> 02:18:46.317
OF A POLITICAL AN ELECTED BOARD.

02:18:46.384 --> 02:18:49.254
TO FRANKLY LEGISLATE FROM THE

02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:52.223
BENCH SO TO SPEAK END OF TAXES

02:18:52.290 --> 02:18:53.224
AND UNITS EARLY IN APPROACH AS

02:18:53.291 --> 02:18:56.327
CONTROL SO NOTED CALIFORNIA'S

02:18:56.394 --> 02:18:58.296
UNIQUE AND POSSESSING AN ELECTED

02:18:58.363 --> 02:18:59.431
BOARD FOR THIS PURPOSE.

02:18:59.497 --> 02:19:00.732
AT EIGHTY ONE OH TWO WAS IN

02:19:00.799 --> 02:19:02.767
LARGE PART NECESSARY AS A RESULT

02:19:02.834 --> 02:19:03.935
OF THE B. ALWAYS FAILURE AS AN

02:19:04.002 --> 02:19:05.904
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY ONE THAT

02:19:05.970 --> 02:19:06.838
IS SUBJECT TO POLITICAL NUMERIC

02:19:06.905 --> 02:19:09.107
MANEUVERING RATHER THAN A

02:19:09.174 --> 02:19:10.442
STRAIGHTFORWARD ADMINISTRATION.

02:19:10.508 --> 02:19:11.676
STATUS AS PROPERTY FUNCTION IN

02:19:11.743 --> 02:19:14.145
PARTICULAR SHOULD LIKE ALL OTHER

02:19:14.212 --> 02:19:15.513
FORMS OF ADJUDICATION BE NON

02:19:15.580 --> 02:19:17.082
POLITICAL UNFORTUNATELY AND

02:19:17.148 --> 02:19:18.383
REPEATEDLY THIS HAS NOT ALWAYS

02:19:18.450 --> 02:19:19.584
BEEN THE CASE.

02:19:19.651 --> 02:19:20.985
OVER THE YEARS THIS HAS RESULTED

02:19:21.052 --> 02:19:22.353
IN DECISION MAKING BY SOME

02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:24.089
MEMBERS AND OR IT RATIONS OF THE

02:19:24.155 --> 02:19:25.256
BOARD THAT HAS BEEN FAR MORE

02:19:25.323 --> 02:19:26.958
RESPONSIVE TO INDUSTRY THAN TO

02:19:27.025 --> 02:19:28.293
COUNTY ASSESSOR'S BOARD OF

02:19:28.359 --> 02:19:29.594
SUPERVISORS AND EVERYDAY

02:19:29.661 --> 02:19:30.895
CALIFORNIANS.

02:19:30.962 --> 02:19:32.397
IN FACT OVER THE YEARS MUCH OF

02:19:32.464 --> 02:19:33.598
C. TERRY'S WORK WITH THE BEER WE

02:19:33.665 --> 02:19:35.033
HAS CENTERED AROUND MITIGATING

02:19:35.100 --> 02:19:36.201
FOR THE OVER PUT OVER

02:19:36.267 --> 02:19:38.536
POLITICIZATION OF THAT AGENCY IS

02:19:38.603 --> 02:19:40.004
ADJUDICATORY ROLE.

02:19:40.071 --> 02:19:41.473
SPECIFICALLY WE'VE SEEN THE BEER

02:19:41.539 --> 02:19:42.407
WE UNDER ASSESS THE

02:19:42.474 --> 02:19:43.842
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY IN

02:19:43.908 --> 02:19:45.310
PARTICULAR WE HAVE STRUGGLED TO

02:19:45.376 --> 02:19:46.611
HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO IN FOR

02:19:46.678 --> 02:19:48.113
SALES TAX COLLECTION WITH ONLINE

02:19:48.179 --> 02:19:49.948
RETAILERS SUCH AS AMAZON SINCE

02:19:50.014 --> 02:19:52.250
THE LATE NINETIES --

02:19:52.317 --> 02:19:53.351
THESE FACTS BECOME EVEN MORE

02:19:53.418 --> 02:19:54.552
ALARMING WHEN YOU COMPARE THE

02:19:54.619 --> 02:19:56.221
EXPERTISE AND CAPACITY TO THE

02:19:56.287 --> 02:19:57.589
BOARD TO A TIP TYPICAL COUNTY

02:19:57.655 --> 02:19:59.090
ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARD.

02:19:59.157 --> 02:20:00.625
CERTAINLY THOSE INDIVIDUALS --

02:20:00.692 --> 02:20:02.160
ARE ELECTED AS WELL BUT THERE IS

02:20:02.227 --> 02:20:03.561
A HUGE DISCREPANCY IN THE NUMBER

02:20:03.628 --> 02:20:04.596
OF TRAINING --

02:20:04.662 --> 02:20:06.131
EXPERTISE AND I THINK THERE WERE

02:20:06.197 --> 02:20:07.966
OTHER COMMENTS I WON'T REITERATE

02:20:08.032 --> 02:20:09.601
THAT RELATED TO SOME OF THE THE

02:20:09.667 --> 02:20:11.636
BELT AND SUSPENDERS THAT ENSURE

02:20:11.703 --> 02:20:13.338
THAT THESE BODIES OPERATE IN A

02:20:13.404 --> 02:20:17.308
WAY THAT IS AN ETHICAL AND

02:20:17.375 --> 02:20:18.977
EFFICIENT --

02:20:19.043 --> 02:20:19.577
ABSENT A DECISION MAKING BOARD

02:20:19.644 --> 02:20:19.811
WITH --

02:20:19.878 --> 02:20:20.278
VERIFIABLY APPROPRIATE

02:20:20.345 --> 02:20:21.346
BACKGROUND AND TAX

02:20:21.412 --> 02:20:22.413
ADMINISTRATION AND IT DID

02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:24.482
ADJUDICATION AND NO POLITICAL

02:20:24.549 --> 02:20:26.151
MANAGEMENT EXCUSE ME MOTIVATION

02:20:26.217 --> 02:20:27.452
HOW CAN TAXPAYERS BE ASSURED

02:20:27.519 --> 02:20:28.787
THAT THE DECISIONS OF THE BOARD

02:20:28.853 --> 02:20:30.121
WILL BE NOTED BY APPROPRIATE

02:20:30.188 --> 02:20:30.755
FACTORS.

02:20:30.822 --> 02:20:33.258
AND ARE NOT WRONGLY INCENTIVIZED

02:20:33.324 --> 02:20:34.993
CURRENTLY UNDER THE CURRENT

02:20:35.059 --> 02:20:36.060
MODEL THEY CANNOT.

02:20:36.127 --> 02:20:38.096
WIN WRONGLY MINDED OR MOTIVATED

02:20:38.163 --> 02:20:39.798
DECISION MAKING DOES OCCUR AND

02:20:39.864 --> 02:20:41.199
THERE IS NO REASON EVEN UNDER A

02:20:41.266 --> 02:20:42.801
NEW BOARD TWO I BELIEVE THAT

02:20:42.867 --> 02:20:44.469
THIS COULD NOT OCCUR AGAIN IT IS

02:20:44.536 --> 02:20:45.804
IN FACT THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY

02:20:45.870 --> 02:20:47.038
THAT IS LEFT TO CLEAN UP THE

02:20:47.105 --> 02:20:48.807
BASS AND IT IS TAXPAYERS WHO PAY

02:20:48.873 --> 02:20:49.808
THE PRICE.

02:20:49.874 --> 02:20:51.776
OF COURSE AS I MENTIONED THERE

02:20:51.843 --> 02:20:54.813
KEEP FUNCTIONS THAT ARE WE WOULD

02:20:54.879 --> 02:20:56.481
WANT TO INSURE ARE PRESERVED --

02:20:56.548 --> 02:20:58.016
AND SO WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE THIS

02:20:58.082 --> 02:21:00.451
BODY TO INSURE ANY LEGISLATIVE.

02:21:00.518 --> 02:21:01.553
REFORM EFFORTS WERE

02:21:01.619 --> 02:21:02.787
CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM EFFORTS

02:21:02.854 --> 02:21:04.255
PRESERVE THOSE FUNCTIONS

02:21:04.322 --> 02:21:05.623
EXISTING STATE JOBS AND ASSURE

02:21:05.690 --> 02:21:07.125
APPROPRIATE MECHANISMS FOR

02:21:07.192 --> 02:21:08.860
TAXPAYERS TO TAXPAYERS TO ACCESS

02:21:08.927 --> 02:21:10.528

SORT OF TRANSFERRING POWER

02:21:27.011 --> 02:21:28.279

TO TALK TO YOUR OWN CONSTITUENTS

02:22:37.715 --> 02:22:38.349

02:22:43.955 --> 02:22:45.089
LOCALLY --

02:22:45.156 --> 02:22:48.693
AND WHILE CALAVERAS DOES NOT.

02:22:48.760 --> 02:22:50.595
IS NOT THE TAIL THAT WAGS THE

02:22:50.662 --> 02:22:52.630
DOG OF CALIFORNIA --

02:22:52.697 --> 02:22:54.132
THEY'RE STILL VOTERS THEY STILL

02:22:54.198 --> 02:22:55.934

02:22:56.935 --> 02:22:58.503
I SHOULD HAPPEN WITH AN ELECTED

02:22:58.569 --> 02:23:01.472

UNANIMOUSLY THUS FAR THOSE I'VE

02:23:03.374 --> 02:23:04.309

02:23:04.375 --> 02:23:06.077
TO I DO NOT SEE A REASON TO

02:23:06.144 --> 02:23:09.314
REMOVE THE ELECTIVE.

02:23:09.380 --> 02:23:11.549
LEVEL OF THE BOP --

02:23:11.616 --> 02:23:13.584
SOME HAVE HAVE USED WORDS LIKE

02:23:13.651 --> 02:23:14.886
POWER GRAB.

02:23:14.953 --> 02:23:17.188
OTHERS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THEY

02:23:17.255 --> 02:23:20.325
KEEP THERE ARE ELECTED OFFICIALS

02:23:20.391 --> 02:23:21.526

AVAILABLE TO YOU.

02:23:32.170 --> 02:23:35.773
HI IF HOWEVER THE STATE WERE TO

02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:36.874
GO THAT WAY --

02:23:36.941 --> 02:23:39.143
YOUR FOLLOW UP QUESTION WAS I

02:23:39.210 --> 02:23:40.979
SHOULD IT BE A STANDALONE AGENCY

02:23:41.045 --> 02:23:44.015

COMMENTS MADE TO ME BY THE

02:23:57.695 --> 02:23:58.696

ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY TREASURERS

02:24:00.932 --> 02:24:02.266
AND TAX COLLECTORS AND WHAT HE

02:24:02.333 --> 02:24:03.601
SAID WAS.

02:24:03.668 --> 02:24:05.770
THE TAX COLLECTORS ARE JEALOUS

02:24:05.837 --> 02:24:07.839
OF THE ASSESSORS RELATIONSHIP

02:24:07.905 --> 02:24:09.540
WITH THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION.

02:24:09.607 --> 02:24:11.809
JEALOUS BECAUSE WE HAD A UNIQUE

02:24:11.876 --> 02:24:14.612
RELATIONSHIP WE WORKED WELL AND

02:24:14.679 --> 02:24:16.981
HAD OVERSIGHT THAT WAS BASED ON

02:24:17.048 --> 02:24:18.316
RESPECT.

02:24:18.383 --> 02:24:20.585
THE TAX COLLECTORS ARE OVERSEEN

02:24:20.651 --> 02:24:22.620
BY THE STATE CONTROLLER AS IS

02:24:22.687 --> 02:24:25.323
THE AUDITORS AUDITOR CONTROLLERS.

02:24:25.390 --> 02:24:27.025
FOR THE COUNTY SO THEIR

02:24:27.091 --> 02:24:29.027
RELATIONSHIP WAS WITH AN ELECTED

02:24:29.093 --> 02:24:30.695

02:24:30.762 --> 02:24:31.763
OFFICIAL.

02:24:31.829 --> 02:24:32.864
AS I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT

02:24:32.930 --> 02:24:33.831
OVER THE YEARS AND IT'S BEEN

02:24:33.898 --> 02:24:37.468

WITH THE TAX PAYERS.

02:25:44.001 --> 02:25:45.670
AN ELECTED BODY REALLY DOES LEND

02:25:45.736 --> 02:25:47.805
ITSELF MORE TO TRANSPARENCY AND

02:25:47.872 --> 02:25:49.807
ACCOUNTABILITY --

SMALL BUSINESS OWNER ALSO REALLY

02:25:59.851 --> 02:26:00.585
HELPS.

02:26:00.651 --> 02:26:02.386
UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES AND

02:26:02.453 --> 02:26:03.888
CHALLENGES THAT TAXPAYER MAY

02:26:03.955 --> 02:26:05.456
HAVE TO COMPLY WITH DIFFERENT

02:26:05.523 --> 02:26:07.625
LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND ONLY AT

02:26:07.692 --> 02:26:09.193
THE STATE LEVEL OR TAX AGENCY.

02:26:09.260 --> 02:26:10.027
BUT THE DIFFERENT LOCAL

02:26:10.094 --> 02:26:12.864
REGULATIONS THAT ALSO HAVE.

02:26:12.930 --> 02:26:14.365
TO BE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AND

02:26:14.432 --> 02:26:18.069
COMPLY WITH RANDOM BEING.

02:26:18.136 --> 02:26:20.204
A NORMAL TAXPAYER --

02:26:20.271 --> 02:26:21.939
IT IN TERMS OF THE ELECTED BODY

02:26:22.006 --> 02:26:23.040
YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE SEEN

02:26:23.107 --> 02:26:24.642
TYPICALLY IS IF THERE IS

02:26:24.709 --> 02:26:26.711
WRONGDOING ON THE PART OF AN

02:26:26.777 --> 02:26:28.412
OFFICIAL OR OFFICIALS.

02:26:28.479 --> 02:26:30.314
TYPICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT

02:26:30.381 --> 02:26:32.016
OFFICIAL IS DISCIPLINED.

02:26:32.083 --> 02:26:33.384
AND THAT OFFICIALS NO LONGER

02:26:33.451 --> 02:26:36.320
ELECTED WE DON'T SEE TOO OFTEN

02:26:36.387 --> 02:26:37.855
THE ABOLISHMENT OF AN ENTIRE

02:26:37.922 --> 02:26:39.257
STATE AGENCY BECAUSE OF THE

02:26:39.323 --> 02:26:43.094
WRONG DOINGS OF A HANDFUL FEW.

02:26:43.161 --> 02:26:44.662
AND YOU KNOW WHAT.

02:26:44.729 --> 02:26:46.230
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS.

02:26:46.297 --> 02:26:48.799
THE MORE CHANGES TO THE TAXING

02:26:48.866 --> 02:26:49.967
STRUCTURE.

02:26:50.034 --> 02:26:51.636
OF THE POTENTIAL FOR GREATER

02:26:51.702 --> 02:26:53.671
COMPLICATIONS THAT COULD RESULT

02:26:53.738 --> 02:26:56.741
IN INCREASED TAXPAYER CONFUSION.

02:26:56.807 --> 02:26:58.075
AND ALSO INCREASING THE

02:26:58.142 --> 02:27:00.378
COMPLEXITY FOR THE TAXPAYER TO

02:27:00.444 --> 02:27:01.779
IN ORDER TO FIRE THE REPORTS

02:27:01.846 --> 02:27:02.947
THAT THEY NEED TO IN ORDER TO

02:27:03.014 --> 02:27:04.749
PAY THE TAXES AND ESSENTIALLY

02:27:04.815 --> 02:27:06.918
COMPLY WITH THE LAW.

02:27:06.984 --> 02:27:08.019
NOW AS YOUR QUESTION WHETHER OR

02:27:08.085 --> 02:27:09.587
NOT IT CAN BE AN INDEPENDENT

02:27:09.654 --> 02:27:11.622
ENTITY.

02:27:11.689 --> 02:27:13.257
OR FOLDED I THINK OUR

02:27:13.324 --> 02:27:14.559
OBSERVATIONS ARE THAT IT'S

02:27:14.625 --> 02:27:16.527
IMPORTANT FOR THOSE FUNCTIONS TO

02:27:16.594 --> 02:27:17.228
BE.

02:27:17.295 --> 02:27:18.963
INTACT WHETHER IT'S TRANSFERRED

02:27:19.030 --> 02:27:21.132
OR AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY AND THE

02:27:21.199 --> 02:27:22.466
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITY BUT

02:27:22.533 --> 02:27:24.468
ESPECIALLY THE EXPERTISE OF THE

02:27:24.535 --> 02:27:26.003
STAFF -- AND

02:27:26.070 --> 02:27:27.638
SPEAKING PRIMARILY TO THE STATE

02:27:27.705 --> 02:27:29.674
ASSESS PROPERTIES DIVISION

02:27:29.740 --> 02:27:31.642
EXPERTISE AND STAFF NEED TO BE

02:27:31.709 --> 02:27:33.511
TRANSFERRED AND ONCE AGAIN

02:27:33.578 --> 02:27:35.580
TRANSFERRED INTACT AS A PROGRAM.

02:27:35.646 --> 02:27:37.114
THAT NOT BROKEN UP IN SEGREGATED

02:27:37.181 --> 02:27:40.151
INTO DIFFERENT SO MUCH SO OPTION

02:27:40.218 --> 02:27:41.319
A WOULD REMAIN INDEPENDENTLY

02:27:41.385 --> 02:27:43.554
ELECTED.

02:27:43.621 --> 02:27:44.188
AND THEN IF --

02:27:44.255 --> 02:27:46.257
AGAIN.

02:27:46.324 --> 02:27:47.158
WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO

02:27:47.225 --> 02:27:49.694
RIGHT SO THIS IS MORE ON JUST

02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:51.195
YOUR AT GOT AT THIS POINT.

02:27:51.262 --> 02:27:53.497
INDEPENDENT ELECTED AND THEN BE

02:27:53.564 --> 02:27:55.533
IF THERE WAS A GIRL IN THE PAIN

02:27:55.600 --> 02:27:56.067
LIKE DID THEY NEED TO BE A

02:27:56.133 --> 02:27:57.168
STANDALONE.

02:27:57.235 --> 02:27:58.869
OR TRANSFERRED AS A UNIT YES YES

02:27:58.936 --> 02:28:01.105
THANK YOU.

02:28:01.172 --> 02:28:02.440
THANK YOU SO MUCH TO ME

02:28:02.506 --> 02:28:02.740
[inaudible]

02:28:02.807 --> 02:28:04.542
BENTON.

02:28:04.609 --> 02:28:07.011
THANK YOU MISTER KERR --

02:28:07.078 --> 02:28:08.980
I THINK I WOULD HAVE --

02:28:09.046 --> 02:28:10.381
TO LOOK AND SAY I DON'T THINK IT

02:28:10.448 --> 02:28:12.183
STILL NEEDS TO BE ELECTED ON ALL

02:28:12.250 --> 02:28:13.417
EXPLAIN WHY.

02:28:13.484 --> 02:28:14.685
AND I DO THINK THERE'S AN

02:28:14.752 --> 02:28:16.787
OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD STRUCTURE

02:28:16.854 --> 02:28:18.656
FOR ACCESS AND ADVOCACY I THINK

02:28:18.723 --> 02:28:20.258
WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD

02:28:20.324 --> 02:28:21.359
IT SMARTLY.

02:28:21.425 --> 02:28:23.561
I THINK IN REGARD TO MY COMMENT

02:28:23.628 --> 02:28:24.362
ABOUT WHY THERE MIGHT BE

02:28:24.428 --> 02:28:26.364
CORRUPTION ELECTED APPOINTED OR

02:28:26.430 --> 02:28:27.632
WHATEVER THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE

02:28:27.698 --> 02:28:29.000
PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE WERE JUST MERE

02:28:29.066 --> 02:28:30.768
MORTALS SO I MEAN WE CAN'T

02:28:30.835 --> 02:28:32.103
REALLY LOOK TO EACH OTHER AND

02:28:32.169 --> 02:28:33.104
SAY YOU KNOW.

02:28:33.170 --> 02:28:34.805
WE'RE GONNA HAVE PERFECTION WITH

02:28:34.872 --> 02:28:37.975
THE ELECTED OR NOT IT WE ALL

02:28:38.042 --> 02:28:38.976
COME IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES.

02:28:39.043 --> 02:28:40.678
BUT IN TERMS OF THAT STRUCTURAL

02:28:40.745 --> 02:28:42.413
OPPORTUNITY I THINK THE THINGS

02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:43.748
THAT COME TOGETHER WITH

02:28:43.814 --> 02:28:45.716
NECESSARILY A NON ELECTED OR

02:28:45.783 --> 02:28:48.486
WHAT BUT IS THAT YOU CAN DEVELOP

02:28:48.552 --> 02:28:50.254
STANDARDS EASIER.

02:28:50.321 --> 02:28:51.856
WE'RE NO LONGER EQUALIZING

02:28:51.922 --> 02:28:53.224
THERE'S A BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:28:53.291 --> 02:28:55.159
JERSEY DISTRICT FOR DISTRIBUTION

02:28:55.226 --> 02:28:56.761
OF SKILL SETS THERE'S A BETTER

02:28:56.827 --> 02:28:58.496
OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT WHAT

02:28:58.562 --> 02:28:59.563
RESOURCES YOU NEED THERE'S A

02:28:59.630 --> 02:29:01.699
BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP

02:29:01.766 --> 02:29:03.100
CONFIDENCE.

02:29:03.167 --> 02:29:05.569
LEADERSHIP SUCCESSION PLANNING

02:29:05.636 --> 02:29:07.838
LONG TERM PROGRAMMING.

02:29:07.905 --> 02:29:09.240
FOCUS ON EFFICIENCIES

02:29:09.307 --> 02:29:10.574
QUALIFICATIONS AND

02:29:10.641 --> 02:29:12.743
ACCOUNTABILITY ALL THOSE THINGS

02:29:12.810 --> 02:29:14.979
IN MY OPINION GET VERY STRONG

02:29:15.046 --> 02:29:17.181
WITH THE ABILITY TO MANAGE THAT

02:29:17.248 --> 02:29:20.251
IN SOME FASHION AND WITH REGARD

02:29:20.318 --> 02:29:21.686
TO WHETHER IT NEEDS TO BE A

02:29:21.752 --> 02:29:23.154
STAND ALONE OR NOT.

02:29:23.220 --> 02:29:24.021
I THINK YOU'VE.

02:29:24.088 --> 02:29:25.990
YOU MAY EVEN BE BOXING YOURSELF

02:29:26.057 --> 02:29:27.958
IN THERE YOU MAY BE ABLE TO LOOK

02:29:28.025 --> 02:29:29.393
AT AND SAY WELL MAYBE WE DON'T

02:29:29.460 --> 02:29:30.895
HAVE TO DO EXACTLY THE SAME

02:29:30.961 --> 02:29:32.363
WHETHER IT'S A STANDALONE OR

02:29:32.430 --> 02:29:33.297
ELECTED.

02:29:33.364 --> 02:29:36.400
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE SOMEBODY WHO'S

02:29:36.467 --> 02:29:37.468
HAVE A BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT

02:29:37.535 --> 02:29:39.437
COMES IN THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE

02:29:39.503 --> 02:29:41.372
DIFFERENT AGENCIES OR INCLUDING

02:29:41.439 --> 02:29:42.773
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC.

02:29:42.840 --> 02:29:44.742
SO I'M NOT SURE IF I WAS LOOKING

02:29:44.809 --> 02:29:46.577
AT THIS I WOULD LOOK EVEN WITHIN

02:29:46.644 --> 02:29:49.280
THE FRAMEWORK OF IT HAS TO BE --

02:29:49.347 --> 02:29:50.881
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER I THINK THIS

02:29:50.948 --> 02:29:52.850
OPPORTUNITY.

02:29:52.917 --> 02:29:55.152
THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS BENSON SO --

YOUR BELIEVE NO LONGER NEED AN

02:29:58.155 --> 02:29:59.857
ELECTED BOARD AND TO BE

02:29:59.924 --> 02:30:01.892
DETERMINED ON WHAT A STRUCTURE

02:30:01.959 --> 02:30:03.194
WOULD LOOK LIKE --

02:30:03.260 --> 02:30:04.995
IN HOW THAT --

02:30:05.062 --> 02:30:06.697
ORG CHART WOULD BE.

02:30:06.764 --> 02:30:09.000
IF THE MOVE AWAY FROM ELECTED

02:30:09.066 --> 02:30:11.068
AND IT COULD BE INDEPENDENT IT

02:30:11.135 --> 02:30:12.670
COULD BE WITH MULTIPLE AGENCIES

02:30:12.737 --> 02:30:14.405
TO BE DETERMINED YES THANK YOU

02:30:14.472 --> 02:30:15.740

pAFFILIATE MYSELF WITH A NUMBER

02:30:20.211 --> 02:30:21.379
OF MR BENTSEN'S COMMENTS I

02:30:21.445 --> 02:30:21.979
CERTAINLY.

02:30:22.046 --> 02:30:23.347
WE DON'T FEEL THAT THERE IS A

02:30:23.414 --> 02:30:24.715
NECESSITY FOR AN ELECTED BOARD

02:30:24.782 --> 02:30:26.083
PER SE --

02:30:26.150 --> 02:30:27.852
BUT REGARDLESS THERE IS A

02:30:27.918 --> 02:30:29.253
DEFINITE NEED --

02:30:29.320 --> 02:30:30.388

WITHOUT AN AIRBAG AND AND SO IT

02:30:35.760 --> 02:30:37.194
IS INADEQUATE AT THIS POINT.

02:30:37.261 --> 02:30:39.830
GIVEN THE CYCLE AND HISTORICAL

02:30:39.897 --> 02:30:43.334

EVERYBODY'S BEEN SAYING THERE'S

ONLY ONE ELECTED BOARD BUT THERE

02:37:57.868 --> 02:38:00.103

OB PEARLS OF WISDOM THAT I WON

02:38:22.759 --> 02:38:23.827
THE RECORD.

02:38:23.894 --> 02:38:26.263
AND I'D ALSO SAY THAT THE THE

02:38:26.330 --> 02:38:27.898
LEGISLATION HAD ALL KINDS OF

02:38:27.965 --> 02:38:29.900
CONTROLS THAT THEY PUT ON THE

02:38:29.967 --> 02:38:31.702
BOARD IS SEPARATION THAT THEY

02:38:31.768 --> 02:38:34.137
PUT ON THE MEMBERS FROM THE

02:38:34.204 --> 02:38:34.838
AGENCY.

02:38:34.905 --> 02:38:36.373
IN THE TWENTY YEARS I WAS ON THE

02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:39.476
BOARD THAT ENDED IN.

02:38:39.543 --> 02:38:41.044
NINETY NINE WE NEVER HAD THOSE

02:38:43.513 --> 02:38:45.582
BUT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE

02:38:45.649 --> 02:38:47.618
DIFFERENT TIMES I THINK YOU

02:38:47.684 --> 02:38:48.719

I AM HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE

02:39:18.815 --> 02:39:20.350
CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF TAXPAYER

02:39:20.417 --> 02:39:21.752
ADVOCATES WHICH IS AN

02:39:21.818 --> 02:39:23.020
ORGANIZATION OF PROPERTY TAX

02:39:23.086 --> 02:39:24.655
CONSULTANTS AT THE STATE AND

02:39:24.721 --> 02:39:26.390
LOCAL LEVEL WHOSE PURPOSE IS TO

02:39:26.456 --> 02:39:28.025
PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF CALIFORNIA

02:39:28.091 --> 02:39:29.226
PROPERTY TAXPAYERS.

02:39:29.293 --> 02:39:30.661
THERE ARE THREE POINTS I WOULD

02:39:30.727 --> 02:39:33.063
LIKE TO MAKE VERY QUICK.

02:39:33.130 --> 02:39:35.132
FIRST ACCESS TO ELECTED

02:39:35.198 --> 02:39:37.034
OFFICIALS IS KEY.

02:39:37.100 --> 02:39:38.468
IS KEY ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL

02:39:38.535 --> 02:39:40.270
BUSINESSES WHO DO NOT HAVE THE

02:39:40.337 --> 02:39:42.539
RESOURCES TO RETAIN COUNSEL.

02:39:42.606 --> 02:39:43.941
I PERSONALLY WORKED FOR TWO

02:39:44.007 --> 02:39:44.875
DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF THE BOARD

02:39:44.942 --> 02:39:46.443
OF EQUALIZATION AND I CAN THINK

02:39:46.510 --> 02:39:48.045
OF NUMEROUS EXAMPLES.

02:39:48.111 --> 02:39:49.513
WE'RE A SMALL BUSINESS OR AN

02:39:49.579 --> 02:39:50.714
INDIVIDUAL HAS REACHED OUT TO

02:39:50.781 --> 02:39:51.982
THE ELECTED OFFICIALS OFFICE

02:39:52.049 --> 02:39:52.983
DIRECTLY AND WE WERE ABLE TO

02:39:53.050 --> 02:39:53.684
HELP.

02:39:53.750 --> 02:39:55.285
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

02:39:55.352 --> 02:39:57.287
SECOND POINT AS WE'VE HEARD

02:39:57.354 --> 02:39:58.755
PROPERTY TAX IS CALIFORNIA'S

02:39:58.822 --> 02:40:00.991
SECOND LARGEST REVENUE STREAM

02:40:01.058 --> 02:40:03.427
NEARLY A QUARTER A PROPERTY TAX

02:40:03.493 --> 02:40:04.795
DOLLARS GO TO SCHOOLS AND

02:40:04.861 --> 02:40:06.830
ELECTED PO WE OVERSEAS THE FIFTY

02:40:06.897 --> 02:40:07.464
EIGHT COUNTIES.

02:40:07.531 --> 02:40:09.099
THAT ASSESS AND COLLECT THIS

02:40:09.166 --> 02:40:10.667
REVENUE YOU WANT PUBLICLY

02:40:10.734 --> 02:40:12.302
ELECTED OFFICIALS OVERSEEING

02:40:12.369 --> 02:40:13.570
THESE REVENUES.

02:40:13.637 --> 02:40:15.038
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT NOT AN

02:40:15.105 --> 02:40:16.573
ORGANIZATION LIKE THE DMV THE

02:40:16.640 --> 02:40:18.675
BEER WE PROVIDE THIS OVERSIGHT

02:40:18.742 --> 02:40:20.110
THROUGH PROPERTY TAX REGULATIONS

02:40:20.177 --> 02:40:21.712
GUIDANCE AND AUDITS.

02:40:21.778 --> 02:40:22.612
OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES

02:40:22.679 --> 02:40:24.982
SENSORS OFFICES AND THIS ELECTED

02:40:25.048 --> 02:40:27.217
OVERSIGHT IS SO CRITICAL IS ONE

02:40:27.284 --> 02:40:29.052
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHECKS AND

02:40:29.119 --> 02:40:30.287
BALANCES THAT WE HAVE TAXPAYERS

02:40:30.354 --> 02:40:32.255
HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:40:32.322 --> 02:40:33.890
IT PROTECTS NOT JUST DATA SAYS

02:40:33.957 --> 02:40:35.525
COMPANIES PUBLIC UTILITIES BUT

02:40:35.592 --> 02:40:37.427
ALL PROPERTY TAXPAYERS

02:40:37.494 --> 02:40:39.129
HOMEOWNERS SMALL BUSINESSES ALL

02:40:39.196 --> 02:40:40.430
OF THEM ACROSS THE BOARD.

02:40:40.497 --> 02:40:42.332
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THE ELECTED

02:40:42.399 --> 02:40:43.667
STATE CONTROLLER IN CALIFORNIA

02:40:43.734 --> 02:40:45.502
HAS OVERSIGHT OVER THE COUNTY

02:40:45.569 --> 02:40:46.837
TAX COLLECTOR'S IS WE'VE HEARD

02:40:46.903 --> 02:40:49.106
THE ELECTED ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS

02:40:49.172 --> 02:40:49.740
OVERSIGHT OVER THE DA'S IN THE

02:40:49.806 --> 02:40:50.507
SHERIFF'S.

02:40:50.574 --> 02:40:51.942
SO IT MAKES SENSE THAT BY THE

02:40:52.009 --> 02:40:54.344
SAME TOKEN AN ELECTED TAX BOARD

02:40:54.411 --> 02:40:55.779
THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION HAVE

02:40:55.846 --> 02:40:59.616
OVERSIGHT AND COLLABORATE WITH

02:40:59.683 --> 02:41:00.684
THE ASSESSORS.

02:41:00.751 --> 02:41:01.284
MY THIRD AND FINAL POINT IT IS

02:41:01.351 --> 02:41:02.686
IT IS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS

02:41:02.753 --> 02:41:03.720
COLLABORATION WITH THE

02:41:03.787 --> 02:41:05.022
CALIFORNIA'S ASSESSORS

02:41:05.088 --> 02:41:06.656

MEMBERS THESE CRITICAL REFORMS

02:41:23.273 --> 02:41:24.775
NEVER WOULD HAVE OCCURRED.

02:41:24.841 --> 02:41:26.777
AND BY ADEQUATELY FUNDING TO BE --

02:41:26.843 --> 02:41:28.245
YOU ALLOW IT TO FOCUS ON ITS

02:41:28.311 --> 02:41:30.280

FUNCTIONS AND I KNOW THERE IS AN

02:41:32.382 --> 02:41:33.750
INTEREST FROM A BUDGET

02:41:33.817 --> 02:41:34.885
PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF SAVING

02:41:34.951 --> 02:41:35.318
MONEY.

02:41:35.385 --> 02:41:37.387
YOU CAN DO THAT BY STOPPING THE

02:41:37.454 --> 02:41:39.022
MOVE OF THE B. O. E. SAVING THE

02:41:39.089 --> 02:41:39.990
TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS

02:41:40.057 --> 02:41:41.258
ASSOCIATED WITH IT.

02:41:41.324 --> 02:41:43.627
BUT LOOK TO INCREASE AND NOT

02:41:43.693 --> 02:41:44.528
DECREASE THE FINDING OF THE P.

02:41:44.594 --> 02:41:46.063
