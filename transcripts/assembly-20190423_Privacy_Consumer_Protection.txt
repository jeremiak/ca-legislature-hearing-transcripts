THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BRIDGE JOHN STREAKING WITH THIS -- CH AND CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES MR DALY DID A GOOD JOB AT SUMMARIZING THE BILL IN OUR EFFORTS SO I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS SHORT TODAY -- THE PRIMARY PURPOSE AND GOAL OF AB NINETEEN NINETY TWO ONE IS TO KEEP THE REGULATION OF INSURANCE UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE COMMISSIONER LARA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. AS INDICATED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WE'RE TRYING TO DO THIS BY RECONCILING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS. KNOWN AS THE INSURANCE INFORMATION PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT AND THOSE OF THE CZ PA. SO THE BILL IN FRONT OF YOU REPRESENTS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO COME UP SO FAR BUT IT STILL REMAINS A WORK IN PROGRESS OR ASKING YOU TO MOVE THIS BILL TODAY SO WE CAN CAN YOU DISCUSSIONS.

THANKS VERY MUCH A NEXT WITNESS PLEASE YES RED WINGER ALSO WITH THE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES. AND DID THE LAW THAT YOU. ARE LOOKING AT TODAY THE I. P.

AND THAT THE COMMISSIONER INSURANCE IS A TOUGH REGULATOR ELECTED INSURANCE REGULATOR AND HAS PLENTY OF ABILITY. TO ENFORCE PRIVACY LAWS SO THAT WAS OUR FIRST PRIVACY LAW HERE IN CALIFORNIA. ACTUALLY IT PROCEEDED ONE ON THE CONCERT CONFIDENTIALITY OF MEDICAL INFORMATION SO THE EXISTS EXISTING EXEMPTION YOU SEE. WAS TO PUT US UNDER THIS AYE AYE PA WHICH IS. A MODEL LAW. DEVELOPED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS SO. UNIFORMITY IN THE INSURANCE WORLD IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE'RE A STATE REGULATED BUSINESS -- AND THAT'S ANOTHER DISCUSSION FEDERAL OR STATE REGULATION BUT AS A STATE REGULATED.

THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY MY NAME IS JACOB SNOW. I'M A TECHNOLOGY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES ATTORNEY. AT THE ACLU OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. DO YOU FEEL YOU OF CALIFORNIA OPPOSES THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WOULD WE CAN. PRIVACY PROTECTIONS UNDER CC PA FOR THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. THE QUESTION IS WHY HAVE DIFFERENT RULES FOR THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WHEN THE RISKS I'M SURE PEOPLE FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE JUST AS RISKS REAL THE PRIVACY RISKS FOR OTHER INDUSTRIES. THREE SEEN TROUBLING SIGNS OF INSURERS TRYING TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS FOR EXAMPLE. TO SET RATES RAISING THE POSSIBILITY OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST COMMUNITIES. OF COURSE THERE'S THE ANTHEM DATA BREACH FROM. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SHOULD THE REMEDIES THAT THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACTS GIVES CONSUMERS INCLUDING THE LIMITED DATA BREACH PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION APPLY WOULD ENSURE. IS THE COMPANY THAT HAS THE DATA BREACH. WE APPRECIATE THE APRIL TWELFTH AMENDMENTS. TWO EIGHTY NINE EIGHTY ONE AND WE APPRECIATE THE PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'VE HAD. BUT WE STILL FEEL THAT THE C. C. P. A.'S DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION -- SHOULD APPLY AND EVEN AS AMENDED THIS BILL WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKEN THE CPA AND THE PROTECTIONS THE PEOPLE THE STATE DESERVE. THE BILL WOULD ELIMINATE THE CONSUMERS PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION INSTANCES OF A DATA BREACH IT WOULD REMOVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ABILITY TO ENFORCE POOR PRIVACY PRACTICES. THOSE DEFICITS WILL DO NOTHING BUT UNDERMINE. ENFORCEMENT AND LIMIT CONSUMERS REMEDIES WE ASK YOUR NUMBER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT PLEASE. HI MY NAME IS ALISTAIR RETIRED WITH THAT CALIFORNIA'S FOR CONSUMER PRIVACY. WE OPPOSE THE BILL BUT I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE MEMBER AND STAFF AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF -- FOR WORKING -- A LOT OF MOVEMENT WAS MADE TOWARDS -- BUT A PLACE WHERE I HOPE WE CAN. COME TO I THINK -- AT THIS POINT YOU KNOW WE OPPOSE CONCEPTUALLY IDEA OF AN ENTIRE INDUSTRY. BEING SENT FROM THE BILL THOUGH THE AMENDMENT DOES -- GO A LONG WAY I THINK THAT. RIGHT NOW WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON A HOPEFUL IN THE COMING WEEKS FURTHER DEFINING BECAUSE THAT MA'AM IT DOES HAVE SOME -- AMBIGUITY. FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IS NECESSARY TO RETAIN -- WHAT WHAT INFORMATION IS NECESSARY? TO RETAIN A COMPLETE ANSWER TRANSACTION AND THEN A DEFINING WHAT HAS BEEN WHAT ACTUALLY A REQUEST BY THE CONSUMER MEANS SO I THINK WITH WITH WORK GOING FORWARD HOPEFULLY WE CAN NOT TIGHTEN UP THESE DEFINITIONS -- AT THIS POINT WE STILL OPPOSE BUT THAT WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THE MEMBER FOR FOR MOVING MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE COMPORT. I DON'T PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF. SMITH THE KORAN ON BEHALF OF CAN STACK SKEWS ME ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARING HOUSE AND COMMON SENSE KIDS ACTION -- WE DO LIKE TO WOULD LIKE THINK THE AUTHOR AND THE ADVOCATES FOR THEIR ON GOING WORK ON THIS ISSUE BUT TO REMAIN OPPOSED AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL -- WHEN THIS IS IN OPPOSITION XENON IS BRING IT BACK TO COMMUNICATIONS COMMENTS COMMITTEE MEMBERS? SCENE I LET ME LET ME BEGIN BY THANKING THE AUTHOR AND HIS TEAM FOR FOR THEIR WORK -- OF THE LAST FEW WEEKS IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD ON THIS AND AND UP. YOU KNOW THE EFFORTS REALLY GO A LONG WAY TO ITS -- ACHIEVING OUR MUTUAL GOALS AND THAT IS TO ENSURING THAT THE INSURANCE. IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY CAN CONTINUE TO SERVE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WHO ARE WHILE ALSO PROTECTING THOSE PERSONS PRIVACY. I KNOW IT THAT IT'S NOT A SMALL TASK TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TWO STATUTORY A SCHEMES ARE COMPATIBLE. ALL IN I THINK THAT -- THE THE AUTHOR AND THE TEAM. WILL CONTINUE -- TO TO MAKE THE I. A. P. P. A. S. PRIVACY PROTECTIVE AS CCPA SO I'M GRATEFUL. AND OBVIOUSLY THIS BILL IS THE WORK IN PROGRESS AS AS BEEN MENTIONED AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT -- THE AUTHOR AT THE INDUSTRY AS WELL AS PRIVACY ADVOCATES WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK -- AT SPECIFIC CONFLICTS AND TRY TO FIND TO THIS PROCESS SO WITH THAT I AM ARE COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING THE BILL AS IT IS -- A WRITTEN AND A AS AMENDED -- IF ALL IT ARE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ARE.

THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND THE WORK OF YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF -- AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND HAVE SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SAU. HI SO I KILEY. KILEY I'VE BAUER-KAHAN I BAUER-KAHAN I BERMAN. BERMAN HI CALDERON [inaudible] GABRIEL [inaudible] GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER NOT VOTING IRWIN -- WHEN I OBERNOLTE? OBERNOLTE I SMITH. SMITH OF STAIN WICKS. YOU HAVE SIX VOTES THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SIR LET'S SEE -- MISS IRWIN IS NEAR. HOW THE MEADOWS GO DOWN THE LIST -- MISS IRWIN WHICH LIKE TO PRESENT YOUR TWO BILLS. YOU HAVE AB EIGHT SEVENTY THREE AND EIGHT SEVENTY FOUR SO WHICH ONE WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE A FIRST I WILL -- START WITH. EIGHT SEVENTY THREE EIGHT SEVENTY THREE IT IS. ALL RIGHTS -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT TO AB EIGHT SEVEN THREE I'M ACCEPTING THAT COMMITTEES AND SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE STAKEHOLDERS WHO HELPED WORK TO FIND COMMON GROUND. ON THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES I WILL KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF BUT THIS BILL IS ONE OF TWO THAT I'M OFFERING. THIS YEAR AS A RESULT OF THE EXTENSIVE WORK DONE BY THE CHAMBER TO BRING THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TOGETHER TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO IMPLEMENT CCPA. THE CHAMBERS WORKED DILIGENTLY TO DISTILL THE NUMEROUS CONCERNS OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY INTO A SHORTLIST OF CRITICAL ISSUES THAT WOULD END. UP HE DID BUSINESS COMMUNITY FROM PROVIDING CALIFORNIANS WITH THE NEW RIGHTS PROMISED TO THEM BY CCPA. THIS BILL TAKES ON ONE OF TWO OF THESE ISSUES AND THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION AND THE DEFINITION OF DE IDENTIFIED. I'LL LET MY WITNESSES GET INTO THE WORKING DETAILS OF THE BILL OF THAT AS I JUST AGREE TO BE AMENDED AND THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THOSE TWO THRESHOLD CONSIDERATIONS A MAKES THE CPA IMPLEMENTATION MORE STRAIGHT FORWARD AND WORKABLE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SERIBU WITH CAL CHAMBER TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT JUST WANTED TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ALL THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND MISTER MCTAGGART HIS TEAM FOR MEETING WITH US. FOR TAKING THE TIME TO UNDERSTAND OUR CONCERNS AND PROPOSING A COMPROMISE ALTERNATIVE TO THE ORIGINAL BILL ALTHOUGH IT DOESN'T ADDRESS ALL OF OUR CONCERNS IT'S THE FIXES IT DOES OFFER ARE CRUCIAL TO BUSINESSES BEING ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THIS LAW. SO WE'RE ACCEPTING THE COMPROMISE -- WHICH IS RECOMMENDED THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AS WELL I AB SEVEN EIGHT EIGHT SEVENTY THREE IS NOW BOIL DOWN TO JUST TWO FIXES ADDING THE WORD REASONABLY AND FRONT OF CAPABLE OF BEING ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. AND TO FIXING THE DEFINITION OF DE IDENTIFIED DATA WHICH MY COLLEAGUE JIM HELPER WILL EXPLAIN. THE CZ PA DEFINES PERSONAL INFORMATION VERY BROADLY AS INFORMATION THAT IDENTIFIES RELATES TO DESCRIBES OR IS CAPABLE OF BEING ASSOCIATED WITH WORK COULD REASNABLY BE LINKED TO A PARTICULAR CONSUMER HOUSEHOLD. ODDLY THE DEFINITION CREATES A REASONABLENESS STANDARD FOR DATA THAT CAN BE LINKED TO A PERSON BUT NOT DATA THAT IS CAPABLE OF BEING ASSOCIATED WITH A PERSON WHICH IS MORE BROAD. THAT MEANS THAT PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE C. CPA'S ENTER ANY INFORMATION THAT COULD IN THEORY BE ASSOCIATED WITH SOMEONE AND THAT COULD PRODUCE SOME EXTREME RESULTS FOR EXAMPLE IF A CUSTOMER MAKES PURCHASES AT A BRICK AND MORTAR STORE. THAT STORE COULD BE REQUIRED TO SEARCH SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE FROM THE DATES OF THOSE PURCHASES TO FIND WHERE THE CUSTOMER APPEARS ON IT. AND PROVIDE THAT FOOTAGE BACK TO THE CUSTOMER OR DELETED EVEN IF THE STORE NEVER LINK THAT SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE BACK TO ANYONE. A STORE MIGHT BE CAPABLE OF ASSOCIATING THAT DATA WITH A CUSTOMER AND THEREFORE ARGUABLY MUST DO SO UNDER THE LAW. IT'S AN UNREASONABLE BURDEN ON BUSINESS AND IT DOESN'T ADVANCE PRIVACY BUT EIGHTY EIGHT SEVENTY THREE BUT ALLEVIATE MUCH OF THIS CONCERN BY ADDING THIS REASONABLE THE STANDARD BEFORE CAPABLE BEING ASSOCIATED WITH -- FINALLY WE DO AGREE TO REMOVE FROM THE BILL THE DEBATE OVER HOW TO ADDRESS THE PRIVACY IMPLICATIONS OF ALLOWING ONE MEMBER OF A HOUSEHOLD ACCESS REALLY INFORMATION FROM ANOTHER MEMBER OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD BUT WE STILL HAVE SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH THIS PROVISION AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH MR. CHOW ANY OTHER PRIVACY STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS IT IN AB. TWENTY FIVE MEMBERS RESPECTFULLY ASK DR THANK YOU THANKS THANKS VERY MUCH NEXT WHEN HIS VOICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAME IS JIM HELPER TONIGHT CHAIR CULTURE THE GLOBAL PRIVACY AND CYBER SECURITY PRACTICES AT THE DLA PIPER LAW FIRM. I REITERATED HIS BOOTS THANKS TO YOU ALL FOR YOUR HEARTED SINCE YOU'RE WORKING THANKS TO MR MCTAGGART AS WELL IN COMING UP WITH WAYS TO MAKE THESE DEFINITIONS REALLY WORKABLE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF ASSEMBLY WOMAN OR OR WHEN -- I'M HELPING WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO DELAY PIPER MORE THAN FIFTY CLIENTS TO COMPLY WITH C. CPA AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT A MAJOR CHALLENGE OF THE LAW IS THAT IT IS SO DIFFICULT. FOR BOTH CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES TO UNDERSTAND. THE DEFINITIONS THEY ARE IN SOME CASES THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE NEW HEARD SERWIS DESCRIPTION OF THE CHALLENGE OF OF PERSONAL INFORMATION THE DE IDENTIFIED DEFINITION CURRENTLY SAYS BASICALLY THE DE IDENTIFIED DATA. IS INFORMATION THAT IS NOT PERSONAL DATA THAT CIRCULAR AND IT DOESN'T PROVIDE GUIDANCE ABOUT WHAT TO DO IN ORDER TO DE IDENTIFY DATA. DO IDENTIFYING DATA IS A PRO PRIVACY GOOD PRACTICE AND THERE'S ACTUALLY A REALLY GOOD OPPORTUNITY IN THIS THE CPA TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE ABOUT TO STEER BUSINESSES TOWARD DOING THAT TOWARD THE IDENTIFYING. THE AMENDMENT THAT ALISTAIR BIG THAGARD PROPOSED WOULD FOLLOW THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION FTC'S PRIVACY FRAMEWORKS APPROACH TO DE IDENTIFICATION THE STANDARD IS LINKED OR REASONABLY LINK A BALL TO A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL. AND THIS IS A WELL TESTED PRO PRIVACY APPROACH THAT HAS BEEN IN THE LAW FOR FOR NOW ALMOST SEVEN YEARS THE CCPA WOULD TREAT DATA LINK A BALL TO A HOUSEHOLD ALSO IS PERSONAL INFORMATION. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT TEAM NO OTHER MAJOR PRIVACY LAW INCLUDING IN THE G. P. R. IN EUROPE WHICH THE COMMITTEE HAS LOOKED TO AS A MODEL FOR CCPA. AND THIS REQUIRES CAREFUL CONSIDERATION AND MISTER CHAIRMAN WE LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU ON HOW TO IRON OUT OF SOME OF THE STICKY ISSUES HERE FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE LISTED AS LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSEHOLD. IN A BUSINESS RACK BUSINESSES RECORDS MAYBE ROOMMATES WHO REALLY DON'T TRUST EACH OTHER OR EVEN AN ABUSED HER ABUSIVE SPOUSE. AND FRAUDSTERS COULD ALSO POSE AS A HOUSEHOLD MEMBER AND MAKE A REQUEST THAT THEY MIGHT DO BUT BUSINESS INTO PROVIDING INFORMATION REQUIRING TURNING OVER SPECIFIC PIECES OF DATA OR DELETING ALL DATED RESPONSE TO A REQUEST. THAT SEEMS TO COME FROM ONE MEMBER OF THE HOUSEHOLD COULD GENERATE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS INCLUDE PRIVACY PROBLEMS FOR OTHER HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS AND MAJOR OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES FOR BUSINESSES FOR EXAMPLE THEY MAY ALSO BE CONFLICTING REQUESTS FROM DIFFERENT PEOPLE THE SAME HOUSEHOLD. WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERING THESE VIEWS -- PERJURE I SUPPORT FOR THIS IMPORTANT BILL AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU GOING FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXTEL WHEN THIS PLACE.

WANT TO THANK YOU THE FAMILY MEMBER FOR FOR WORK AND SO WE WITH RESPECT RESPECTFULLY WITHDRAW OUR OPPOSITION WITH THE AMENDMENTS. WHEN THE GOING TO PRINT SO THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK AND WE ARE GRATEFUL TO NEVER HAVE TO SUPPORT IT NOW THANK YOU? THANK YOU. HOUSE RETIRED SIX THANK YOU. TAKE HERE I THINK WE ALL KNOW WHO YOU ARE -- YES ABSOLUTELY -- EDITION ALL. THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN. THE OBJECT OF SNOW WITH THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA -- SO THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA POSES OF THIS BILL BECAUSE WE HAD MULTIPLE LOOPHOLES TO THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. UNDER THE SEA CPA. AND WE'RE PLEASED TO SEE. THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS. AFFECTS. WAS PLEASED TO SEE THAT -- THE BILL HAS BEEN AMENDED TO REMOVE -- THE EXCLUSION -- OF HOUSEHOLD -- BUT GIVEN -- THAT THERE STILL SEEMS TO BE AN ACTIVE DISCUSSION AROUND THAT I'D LIKE TO ARTICULATE A LITTLE BIT WHY IT'S IMPORTANT HOUSEHOLD REMAIN IN THAT MISSION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. FOR MANY OF US OF THE HOME IS THE CENTER OF OUR PRIVATE LIVES. IT'S WERE A FAMILY FRIENDS GATHER AS WE DISCUSSED THE MOST DIFFICULT FINANCIAL MEDICAL OR EMOTIONAL ISSUES. AND IF YOU HAVE ANY ONE OF MANY INTERNET CONNECTED DEVICES IN YOUR HOME LIKE A SMART SPEAKER OR THERMOSTAT. THE VACUUM CLEANER. WIFI ENABLED LIGHT BULBS OR OR PLUGS IN THOSE DEVICES HAVE THE CAPACITY TO IN THE OFTEN DO COLLECT IMMENSE QUANTITIES OF PRIVATE INFORMATION. ABOUT YOUR LIFE. AND THE NEWS IS FULL OF REAL REVELATIONS BUT THESE KIND OF DEVICES ARE BEING USED FOR PURPOSES THAT DO NOT SERVE PEOPLE WELL. AUDIO FROM AMES ON SMART SPEAKER FOR EXAMPLE WAS LISTEN TO BUY AMAZON EMPLOYEES. GOOGLE THERMOSTATS WERE DISCOVERED TO CONTAIN A SECRET MICROPHONE THE COMPANY NEVER DISCLOSED TO THE PEOPLE WHO OPERATE THE DEVICE INTO THEIR HOME. THIS IS A DEADLY IS FROM A COMPANY THAT HAS PATENTS. ON USING CAMERAS INSIDE THE HOME -- SCANNER RECOGNIZE CLOTHING TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE INSIDE THE HOME BY THEIR GENDER BY THEIR AGE. AND TO DETECT ACTIVITIES LIKE WHEN PEOPLE ARE BRUSHING THEIR TEETH. ROOM A THE ROBOT VACUUM CLEANER HAS RAISED THE POSSIBILITY OF SELLING THE FLOOR PLANS THAT ARE COLLECTED AFTER THE VACUUM GOES AROUND AND CLEANS THE FLOOR IN THE HOUSE. ALL THIS INFORMATION IS PRIVATE AND ALL OF IT MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE DEFINITION OF PRIVACY A PRIVATE INFORMATION AND PERSONAL INFORMATION. EVEN THOUGH IT IS ASSOCIATED THE HOUSEHOLD. ONE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. THE LANGUAGE CAPABLE OF BEING ASSOCIATED SHOULD STAY IN THE DEFINITION. NOW WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT. SHE'S EVEN ANONYMIZED INFORMATION IS STILL INTENSELY PRIVATE AND CAN STILL BE RE ASSOCIATED WITH A PERSON. MISTER CHAIR LIKE TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THAT. I KNOW THAT YOU RIGHT NOW ARE IN THIS HEARING ROOM AT THIS LOCATION. LET'S SEE I SEE YOU TWO DAYS LATER AT THE COFFEE SHOP ACROSS FROM THE CAPITOL I KNOW YOU WERE THERE THEN. WHAT THERE WAS A WEATHER APP ON YOUR PHONE? AND THAT WEATHER APP COLLECTS INFORMATION IN AN ANONYMIZED WASTE NOT ASSOCIATE WITH YOUR NAME YOUR ADDRESS OR ANYTHING IT'S JUST SO SAID WITH A UNIQUE IDENTIFIER. THAT WEATHER APP COULD FIND ALL THE RECORDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PERSON. WHO'S AT THAT COFFEE SHOP AND HE WAS IN THIS HEARING ROOM. AND THAT WOULD BE YOU. AND IN THAT WEATHER APP FOR ANYONE THAT THAT WHETHER ABSOLUTE THAT INFORMATION TO WOULD KNOW THE LOCATION. OF THE PERSON WE KNOW YOUR LOCATION GOING FORWARD IN TIME AS YOU MOVED BY THE CITY IF YOU WANT TO A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT WENT TO A MEETING. YOU WENT TO A RELIGIOUS SERVICE OR A POLITICAL PROTEST THAT WEATHER APP WOULD BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY YOU. BECAUSE IT NEW TWO OTHER PIECES OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU. THOSE LOCATIONS THAT'S EXAMPLE ABOUT INFORMATION THAT'S AND BE ENOUGH IT'S ANONYMIZE WE'RE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH AN INDIVIDUAL IS JUSTICE PRIVATE. AND JUSTICE SUBJECT HARM. AS INFORMATION DIRECTLY ASSOCIATE WITH A PERSON. THAT'S ONE VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE. BUT MACHINE LEARNING ANOTHER ARC ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGIES. HAVE THE MAKE THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING PEOPLE IN THIS WAY MUCH MORE ADVANCED MUCH SIMPLER AND TRIVIAL. AND THAT'S TRUE WHETHER YOU'RE IDENTIFYING PEOPLE WITH CERTAINTY OR WHETHER YOU'RE PUBLICLY. IDENTIFYING THEM. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEEING DATA BROKERS WHO ARE SELLING DENOMINATION AS A CIRCUS IS THEY'VE OPERATIONALIZED THIS CAPABILITY AND OFFERING IT TO BUSINESSES. FINALLY THE CPA'S PROTECTIONS FOR DE IDENTIFICATION SHOULD BE PRESERVED. AND V. SIX TO BE A HAS STRONG PROTECTIONS TO REQUIRE THAT TECHNICAL MEASURES TO BE TAKEN WITHIN THE COMPANY STOP GET A VACATION AND BUSINESS -- PROTECTIONS BE PUT IN PLACE TO DO THE SAME THING AND THOSE SHOULD BE PRESERVED. THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION SEASON HERE IT MUST BE FUTURE PROOF. WITH THESE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS IT'S NOT EVEN PRESENT PROOF. WE ASK YOU KNOW BUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ERA ADDITIONAL WITNESSES. GOOD AFTERNOON ARAFAT'S JOHNSON WITH COMMON SENSE WE OPPOSE THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. SMITH THE CARBON ON BEHALF OF ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION AND PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARING HOUSE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. MORE MAHONEY ON BEHALF OF CONSUMER REPORTS A POST. THANK YOU NEXT PLACE. JOE RIGHT OUT IN THE HEALTH OF CONSUMER ACTION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. TRACY ROSENBERG FROM OPEN PRIVACY IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS OF COMMENTS BLISS BRING BACK TO THE COMMUNITY -- QUESTIONS COMMENTS TELL. THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. TO MISSOURI WHICH LIKE A CLOSER I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE AND AND WE DO HAVE -- EIGHT SEVENTY FOUR STILL -- TO PRESENTS THAT'S BUT YOU I FIRST WANT TO THINK. ALISTAIR THAGARD WHO REALLY GOT THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION GOING WITH PRIVACY AND AS MOST OF MY COLLEAGUES KNOW -- I HAVE GRABBED MANY OF YOUR PHONES AND TURNED IT TOLD YOU TO TURN OFF LOCATION SERVICES -- PRIVACY IS AND CYBERSECURITY IS A HUGE ISSUE FOR ME -- WHEN THIS PAST AND IT WAS PASSED -- IN A RATHER HASTY MANNER THERE WERE SOME ISSUES THAT MADE IT AND WORKABLE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE AGAIN THE COMMITTEE. COMMITTEE STAFF MY STAFF CHAMBER IN THE CHAMBER ALLIANCE GETTING TOGETHER DO IT MAKING A LOT OF COMPROMISES TO MAKE SURE. THAT THIS PRIVACY BILL IS -- WORKABLE AND THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A PRIVACY -- THE BILL THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY CAN ON FOLLOW AND AGAIN THAT MEANS THIS NEEDS TO BE WORKABLE AND AND THESE ARE CHANGES OR JUST CLARIFICATIONS TO DEFINITIONS AND WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. YOU ARE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS SAY YES. ALL THE MEASURE WITHOUT DOUBT MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CHAU HI SO I KILEY. KILEY I BAUER-KAHAN HI BAUER-KAHAN HI BERMAN. BERMAN HI CALDERON CALDERON HI GABRIEL [inaudible] GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER I IRWIN. AYE IRWIN AYE OBERNOLTE. OBERNOLTE HI SMITH. SMITH I WHIPPED. THAT BRINGS US TO YOUR NEXT TO A BILL OF BELIEVE IT'S A AB -- EIGHT SEVENTY FOUR THANK YOU CAN ANYTIME YOU'RE READY -- THIS BILL TAKES ON AN ISSUE WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MORE SPECIFICALLY WHAT IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION A LOT MY WASN'T WITNESSES GET INTO THE WORKING DETAILS OF THE BILL AGAIN THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL WERE WILL WILL REMOVE THE RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON USING INFORMATION FROM. PUBLICLY AVAILABLE GOVERNMENT RECORDS TO HELP CCPA AVOID POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT. TODAY WITH ME AGAIN I HAVE SERVICE FROM THE CHAMBER CHRISTOPHER MORE A VICE PRESIDENT FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE SOFTWARE INFORMATION INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRED MEMBERS THERE BUT WITH CAL CHAMBER TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT THE CZ P. EXCLUDES PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION -- BUT THE CCPA DEFINES PUBLICLY INFORMATION A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION QUITE NARROWLY TO ONLY INCLUDE -- INFORMATION IS LAWFULLY MADE AVAILABLE FROM GOVERNMENT RECORDS UNFORTUNATELY THE CCPA THEN NARROWS THE DEFINITION EVEN MORE IN A WAY THAT IT'S AN WORKABLE THAT COULD BE FOUND UNCONSTITUTIONAL SPECIFICALLY THE LAW STATES. GOVERNMENT RECORDS WHAT QUALIFIES PUBLICLY AVAILABLE IF THEY'RE USED FOR A PURPOSE THAT'S NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE DATA IS MAINTAINED MADE AVAILABLE IN THE GOVERNMENT RECORDS OR FOR WHICH IS PUBLICLY MAINTAINED. IT'S CONFUSING AND IT'S IT'S NOT WORKABLE -- IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE HOW BUSINESS WOULD BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHY THE GOVERNMENT AND HE MADE THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. AND EVEN IF THEY COULD FIGURE THAT OUT WHY THE GOVERNMENT RECORDS WERE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC -- IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE INSTANCES WHERE BUSINESS WOULD BE DEEMED TO USE THAT INFORMATION FOR THE SAME REASONS THAT THE GOVERNMENT MADE A PUBLIC. SO TAKE FOR EXAMPLE A POPULAR REAL ESTATE WEBSITE THAT GIVES INFORMATION ABOUT PROPERTY SALES FROM GOVERNMENT RECORDS AND USES IT TO CREATE A SERVICE FOR POTENTIAL HOMEBUYERS. THE BUSINESS USES THE INFORMATION PROVIDE A USEFUL SERVICE AND MAKE A PROFIT. TO SEE HOW THAT WOULD ALIGN WITH FOR WHATEVER REASON THE GOVERNMENT POSTED IT -- SO EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT THREE FOUR MERELY IT REMOVES THIS UNWORKABLE LIMITATION ON THE USE OF GOVERNMENT RECORDS -- IT'S IT'S JUST A SMALL BUT IMPORTANT FIX AND IT'S NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE LAWS NOT DEMAND CONSTITUTIONAL. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. HI MR CHAIRMAN. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SPONSOR THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK -- I'M HAPPY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB. EIGHT SEVEN FOUR MY NAME IS CHRIS MOORE AND I AM THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND GENERAL COUNSEL. FOR THE SOFTWARE AND INFORMATION INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION SIA. IS THE PRINCIPAL TRADE ASSOCIATION OF THE SOFTWARE AND INFORMATION INDUSTRIES AND WE REPRESENT OVER EIGHT HUNDRED COMPANIES TO DEVELOP AND MARKET SOFTWARE AND DIGITAL CONTENT FOR BUSINESS. EDUCATION AND CONSUMERS WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO SUPPORT THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO INDIVIDUAL AUTONOMY AND A HEALTHY DEMOCRACY. AS A BILL ANALYSIS RECOGNIZED THAT RIGHT MUST BE BALANCED AGAINST OTHER IMPORTANT INTERESTS SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH. EIGHT B. EIGHT SEVEN FOUR A MILLER AIDS OUR FIRST AMENDMENT CONCERNS OVER THE WAY THE C. C. P. H. FREED SPEECH IN TWO PRINCIPAL WAYS. FIRST IT REDUCES THE OVER BREATH OF THE LEGISLATION. BY CLARIFYING. THAT THE CCPA DOES NOT REACH INFORMATION CONTAINED IN PUBLIC RECORDS AND FOCUSES THE CPA CCPA ON INFORMATION. MORE COMMONLY THOUGHT OF AS PRIVATE. SECOND BY REMOVING THE COMPATIBLE USE LANGUAGE THE BILL ELIMINATES VAGUENESS PROBLEMS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN SUED FROM PEOPLE HAVING TO GAS WHY A PUBLIC RECORD WAS COLLECTED BEFORE THEY COULD TRANSMIT IT. IN THE PRESENCE OF CERTAIN PROCEDURAL OBJECTIONS. THESE CHANGES GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS ENSURING THAT PUBLIC DOMAIN INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE FOR A WHOLE HOST OF VALUABLE ACTIVITIES INCLUDING TRACKING DOWN MISSING CHILDREN INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM. LOCATING WITNESSES CONDUCTING CORPORATE DUE DILIGENCE AND A NUMBER OF OTHER IMPORTANT GOVERNMENT AND MARKET USES. WE SUPPORT THE BILL AS WRITTEN. WITH THAT SAID WE NOTE THAT THE PUBLIC DOMAIN DOES NOT MERELY CONSIST OF PUBLIC RECORDS. THAT IS WHY WE RECOMMENDED THAT THE COMMITTEE CONSIDER ADDING THE PHRASE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED MEDIA WHICH APPEARS ELSEWHERE IN CALIFORNIA LAW AS A FURTHER STEP TO MINIMIZE. POTENTIAL FIRST AMENDMENT PROBLEMS BUT AS I SAID THAT DOES NOT. AFFECT OUR SUPPORT FOR THIS LEGISLATION AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- NEXT TO A WITNESS PLEASE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE BILL IS OUT. THAT BRINGS US TO AB -- EIGHT FORTY SIX THAT SOME IS BURKE SHE'S. WELCOME IS PART. EIGHT FORTY SIX IS YOUR BILL SO ANYTIME YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PROCEED. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND OF YOUR STAFF ROW -- I KNOW WE SAY THAT ALL THE TIME BUT YOU GUYS HAVE PUT A TON OF WORK WITH US INTO THIS AND I REALLY DO WANT. TO TELL YOU I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE TIME -- OUT OF RESPECT FOR YOU AND AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER OTHER SPEC FOR YOU IN THIS COMMITTEE AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS WITH HOW SECTION TO BE. IS CURRENTLY CONSTRUCTED IN THE BILL TO DAM WILLING TO STRIKE OUT TO BE ENTIRELY WITH THE GOAL CONTINUE TO WORK TO FIND LANGUAGE THAT WE ALL OF RIVER. CREE REFLECTS CURRENT LAW. I UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES THAT SHIFTING THE SECTION AROUND HAS CREATED AND I'M COMMITTED TO THE LAW THAT WAS CREATED IN NEGOTIATED BY YOU AND OTHERS LAST YEAR. AND MAKING SURE IN THIS BILL THAT WE RETAIN THAT BALANCE WHILE ALSO CLARIFYING THAT LOYALTY PROGRAMS CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE. ARE WE WILL ACCEPT THE SECOND THIRTY MINUTES AS LIST ON PAGE TEN OF ANALYSIS WHICH REINSERT THE BUSINESSES SHALL NOT OFFER A DIFFERENT LEVEL GOODS OR SERVICES THAT ARE I'M JUST AND REASONABLE CHORUS ARE ARE YOU SERIOUS. AB EIGHT FORTY SIX CLARIFIES THAT CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT IS NOT INTENDED TO PROHIBIT BUSINESSES FROM OFFERING BECAUSE CUSTOMER LOYALTY PROGRAMS. IT DOES THIS BY REVISING THE NONDISCRIMINATION PROVISION TO EXPRESSLY ALLOW LOYALTY PROGRAMS WILL NOT CHANGING THE BASIC PROHIBITIONS. ON DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE CONSUMER BECAUSE THEY EXERCISE ANY OF THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE CCPA. WITH THIS CURRENT LANGUAGE IN THE C. C. PA BUSINESSES ARE QUESTIONING WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT DO WITH THEIR CUSTOMER LOYALTY PROGRAMS AND ARE SEEKING CLARITY. IN THE LAW TO CONTINUE THEIR OFFERINGS THIS BILL REPLACES THE CURRENT CONFUSING FINANCIAL INCENTIVE PROGRAMS PROVISION OF THE C. CPA WITH AN AUTHORIZATION FOR OFFERING AND BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH A QUICK CUSTOMER LOYALTY PROGRAM. A BUSINESS CAN OFFER A DIFFERENT PRICE RATE LEVEL OR QUALITY OF GOODS OR SERVICES TO A CONSUMER INCLUDING OFFERING ITS GOODS OR SERVICES FOR NO FEE AT THE OFFERING IS IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONSTRUCTION SIMMERS VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION IN A PROGRAM. OR AS A PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED THE OFFERING IS A FOR A GOOD OR SERVICE WHOSE FUNCTIONALITY IS DIRECTLY RELATED. TO THE COLLECTION OR USE OF THE CONSUMERS DATA AB FORTY SIX DIVINES DEFINES WHAT LOYALTY PROGRAMS INCLUDE SO THAT BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS. HAVE EXPLICIT GUIDANCE ON WHAT THESE BENEFITS LOOK LIKE THESE ARE IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY STATUTORY REVISIONS FOR BUSINESSES THAT WANT TO CONTINUE THEIR LOYALTY PROGRAMS. AND FOR THE CONSUMERS WHO WANT TO CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM THAT WITH THEM I HAVE MY ONE OF THE CO AUTHORS. JOINT AUTHORS BUT THE MEMO A GREAT WELCOME BONUS MAMOLA THANK YOU TO MY CO AUTHOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AGREED TO SIGN ON AS A JOINT AUTHORED AB. EIGHT FORTY SIX WITH THE INTENT OF MAKING SURE THAT CONSUMERS MAINTAIN THE ABILITY TO BENEFIT FROM VARIOUS FORMS OF DISCOUNTS THE RETAILERS OFFER IN EXCHANGE FOR THE REGULAR PATRONAGE. I'M OUR REWARDS CLUB PARTICIPANT HI AS ARE MANY OF YOU I'M SURE WITH A NUMBER OF RETAILERS. IF THE CUSTOMER -- IS UNCOMFORTABLE WITH ACCESS TO THEIR PRIVATE INFORMATION THEY HAVE THE OPTION OF NOT PARTICIPATING THAT SAID I DON'T SUPPORT A SYSTEM THAT WOULD ALLOW PENALTIES. THAT ESSENTIALLY FORCE THE CUSTOMER INTO SIGNING UP FOR THE PROGRAM OR OTHERWISE ONLY ALLOW MORE WEALTHY CUSTOMERS TO OPT OUT. THE GOAL IS NOT TO UNDERMINE WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED LAST YEAR IN PROTECTING CUSTOMERS PRIVACY BUT RATHER SIMPLY FIXING THIS REWARDS CARD LOYALTY. PIECE IT IS MY HOPE THAT THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN TO AB EIGHT FORTY SIX TODAY STRIKE THAT BALANCE CORRECTLY TO ALLOW CONSUMERS TO BENEFIT WHILE ALSO PROTECTING PRIVACY I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I LOOK FORWARD.

LOYALTY REWARDS PROGRAMS THEY APPRECIATE THE BENEFITS WE KNOW THAT 80% OF OF CUSTOMERS OF CONSUMERS BELONG TO SOME SORT OF PROGRAM. AND MANY CUSTOMERS BELONG TO MULTIPLE PROGRAMS RETAILERS OFFER THESE PROGRAMS BECAUSE YOU WANT TO ENCOURAGE CUSTOMER LOYALTY AND SOME TO SOME MEMBERS SOME CUSTOMERS CHOOSE TO BELONG OTHERS CHOOSE NOT TO BELONG. EIGHTY THESE ARE OFTEN PROGRAMS AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO OFFER THEM WELL WE APPRECIATE THAT THE SPONSORS AND STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IN TCPA THINK THE CURRENT LAW IS CLEAR THAT WE CAN -- OUR MEMBERS HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THE PROGRAMS CAN CONTINUE OPERATE SO WE DO APPRECIATE MISS BURKE MISTER MULLIN MISTER LOW BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND CLARIFYING THAT THESE PROGRAMS CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE.

ATOMIC TOMORROW HERE ON BEHALF OF BOTH BEST BUY AND HELPERS AND SAFE WAY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU OPPOSITION PLEASE -- COME UP [inaudible] OKAY. HI COMMITTEE GOOD AFTERNOON ARE TRACY CRONENBERG FROM LOCAL PRIVACY ONCE AGAIN WE ARE A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AT CITIZENS BASED CULT COALITION THAT ADVOCATES. FOR PRIVACY REFORM. I'M THE FIRST THING THAT I WANT TO SAY TO YOU IS THAT WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO THE EXEMPTION OF LOYALTY PROGRAMS FROM CCPA. WHICH SORT OF MAKES YOU WONDER WHY I'M SITTING HERE -- THE FIRST THING TO SAY IS THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT COMPANIES AND PROGRAMS DISCLOSE WHAT'S BEING DONE WITH THE DATA OF CUSTOMERS IF BY PARTICIPATING IN A LOYALTY PROGRAM YOUR DATA IS BEING SHARED WITH THIRD PARTIES AND SOLD. YOU SHOULD BE TOLD. HOWEVER THE REALITY IS THAT PEOPLE SIGN UP FOR THESE PROGRAMS VOLUNTARILY THEY CONSENT THEY AFFIRMATIVELY OPTED BECAUSE THEY GET STUFF THAT THEY WANT. BUT THERE'S A BIGGER SORT OF A PROBLEM HERE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE NON DISCRIMINATION LANGUAGE IN CCPA ARE BRINGING THIS UP BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME EARLIER VERSIONS OF THE BILL THAT TACKLE THIS. AND NOW IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE GETTING FURTHER -- A FURTHER DISTANCE FROM WHERE WE SHOULD BE WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A CIVIL RIGHT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PRIVACY AS PROTECTED IN OUR CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. AND BASICALLY THE WHOLE PREMISE OF OF CCPA IS THAT WE AREN'T FORCING A BASIC RIGHT THAT PEOPLE HAVE. THAT RIGHT REALLY CAN'T CALM WITH A FEE IT CAN'T COME WITH A POLL TAX. WE IT CAN'T COME WITH A FEE REASONABLY RELATED TO THE VALUE OF YOUR DATA SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS PORTION. OF CCPA WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF THE LANGUAGE THAT IS THERE. AND I THINK WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO DO SOMETHING BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE DONE BECAUSE I WANT TO BE CLEAR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED BY. OUR PRIVACY VIOLATIONS. AND ABUSES THEY'RE NOT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE TALKING TO YOU TODAY THEY ARE THE POOR THEY ARE THE ELDERLY THEY ARE THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH. THAT TO REALLY SUFFERS AND THERE'S NO I MEAN CALIFORNIA'S HIGHEST COST OF LIVING. IN THE COUNTRY PEOPLE DON'T HAVE PRIVACY BUDGETS AND JEEZ I WORK FOR A NONPROFIT AND I DON'T HAVE A PRIVACY BUDGET I MEAN THE REALITY IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO OPT OUT SEQUENTIALLY OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND PAY A FEE EVERY SINGLE TIME THAT WE ARE NOT REALLY GRANTING THEM A RIGHT. WE ARE GRANTING THEM A GAUNTLET OF FEES AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO JUMP OFF IT SO I WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE OFFICE WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE NON. DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE AND SPEAKER MULLIN SAID SOMETHING ABOUT NOT WANTING. THINGS TO BE FINANCIALLY BURDENSOME I THINK MAYBE THAT PART ABOUT FEES REASONABLY RELATED TO YOUR DATA. IT NEEDS SOME CHANGING AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN DO THAT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR INPUT DEL NEXT ONE IS PLEASE HI ELSTER TECH WERE CALIFORNIA'S FOR CONSUMER PRIVACY OF RESPECTFUL IN OPPOSITION. NO I AM NOT INTO COMMERCE I WANT COMMERCE TO CONTINUE -- ADDRESS THE BILL THAT WAY ORIGINALLY I'M A MEMBER OF MULTIPLE LOYALTY PROGRAM TO THINK THEY'RE FINE I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THEM -- AND IN FACT MOST -- CALIFORNIA REMEMBER THEM AND AND AND REALLY LIKE THEM. WHAT I WOULD SAY -- THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT PROHIBITS LOYALTY PROGRAMS ZERO ZILCH. THIS BILL IS FINE WITH WILL BE PROGRAMS SO THIS. THE REASON FOR THIS LAW IS OBVIOUSLY NOT SIMPLY TO CLARIFY THE PRIVACY PROGRAM DID THAT -- LOYALTY PROGRAMS ARE PERMITTED. SO NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO POINT TO ME WHERE IT SAYS -- YOU CAN'T HAVE A ABOUT LOYALTY PROGRAM. BUT THE PROBLEM IS THE BILL AS AMENDED WILL ALLOW FORCE YOU ESSENTIALLY. INTO BEING PART OF A LOYALTY PROGRAM AND THEN ALLOW YOUR INFORMATION FROM THAT WHAT THE PROGRAM TO BE SOLD IN. BUT MANY PEOPLE SAY WELL I DON'T REALLY CARE IF THEY KNOW MY PURCHASES SO WHAT. WELL THE SO WHAT PART IS. FIRST OF ALL I DON'T CARE HOW WELL DO YOU ARE YOU ALMOST HAVE TO BE A PART OF THE WORLD THE PROGRAM WHO HERE GOES IN THE GROCERY STORE. IT FEELS GOOD BUT NOT BRING YOUR NUMBER AND I WENT IN ABOUT A BOTTLE OF WATER THE OTHER DAY IN A SAFE WAY. AND I PUT MY NUMBER IN IF A 77% CHEAPER. I WANT ONE WATER JUST DRINKING. SO YOU SO AND THE PROBLEM IS IS NOT GONNA FALL INTO THE COURSE TO PRINT JUST BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE GROCERY STORE DOES THIS. SO THERE IS A WHAT WE ALL DO THIS. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE'S MOST BASIC PURCHASES. THEIR FOOD. THERE TWENTY TWELVE I REALLY KEEP BLADDER DO I WANT THE FACT THAT I'M GETTING DEPENDS TO BE. MARKETED TO THE WORLD WHAT ABOUT MY HEALTH INSURANCE WHAT ABOUT MY LIFE INSURANCE IN YOUR DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IS ALLOWED. SOCIAL MEDIA AND PURCHASES NOW START BEING INCLUDED. IN YOUR PRICING FOR LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE THE STORY AT THIS BILL GUYS THIS GETS THROUGH IS GOING TO BE. THAT. WE ARE ALLOWING PRIVACY TO BE FOR RICH PEOPLE. AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE PART OF YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU'RE BEING FORCED TO HAVE YOUR MOST PERSONAL. PRIVATE [inaudible] INFORMATION SOLD. AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S WHY I'M IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AYE ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS IN OPPOSITION PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND YOUR ORGANIZATION. THE CARBON WITH ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION AND PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARING HOUSE ALSO OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED FOR THE REASONS MY COLLEAGUES STATED THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT PLACE. JACOBS KNOW A SO YOU OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU NEXT PLACE. JOE RIGHT OUT WITH CONSUMER ACTION ASO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. ELIZABETH COOLEY COS COMMONSENSE OPPOSE UNLESS A MINUTE THANK YOU MUCH NEXT PLACE. MAUREEN MAHONEY ON BEHALF OF CONSUMER REPORTS IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MUCH. LET'S BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS -- MISTER CALDERON -- I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY SPOKEN SUPPORT OPPOSITION IS BILL I THINK THE AUTHORS FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. YEAH I LIVE DOWN THE STREET FROM COUPLE DIFFERENT GROCERY STORES I'VE STATED BROTHERS THAT'S ACTUALLY CAN BE REBUILT WHICH IS GONNA BE NICE BUT I I TEND TO GO TWO ROUTES A LOT. IT'S A LITTLE BIT CLOSER. IT'S BEEN A LOT OF MONEY BUYING DIAPERS THERE. BUT YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE LOYALTY REWARDS PROGRAM -- AND AND MY FEAR IS THAT IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT AND WE DON'T GO THOUGHT FOR WITH HIS BILL -- WE RUN THE RISK OF ACTUALLY LOSING THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS BECAUSE IF I'M A PART OF A LOYALTY REWARDS PROGRAM. AND I SAY NOW UNDER C. C. P. A. I. ONE OPT OUT. NO NOT HAVE MY INFORMATION USED WELL IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT YOU IT'S WELL IT SEEMS CLEAR ME YOU CANNOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST BECAUSE I'VE OPTED OUT SO. I'M I'M NOW OPTING OUT OF YOU BEING ABLE TO USE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION OR ANY OF MY INFORMATION BUT YOU STILL HAVE. TO GIVE ME THAT DISCOUNT -- AND SO THERE'S REALLY BEEN BECOMES NO INCENTIVE FOR THAT COMPANY TO CONTINUE TO OFFER THAT LOYALTY REWARDS PROGRAM. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ME BECAUSE I'M OPTING OUT THE PROGRAM SO THEREFORE YOU STILL HAVE TO GIVE ME THE DISCOUNT SO THEN WHAT IS THE POINT OF ME EVER EVER HAVING TO SIGN UP. FOR THE LOYALTY REWARDS PROGRAM BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GIVE ME THE DISCOUNT ANYWAYS -- AND AND SO I THINK THAT. WHEN WE? YOU KNOW WE HAD TO ACT FAST AND IT TO TAKE IN A LOT OF INFORMATION WHEN WE WERE OFF WHEN WE WHEN WE HAD TO TAKE A VOTE. ON THE C. C. P. A I THINK THAT WE ARE OBVIOUSLY WE DID THE RIGHT THING -- THROUGH THE CHAIRS WORK IN CENTER HERTZBERG WORK IN EVERYBODY ELSE'S -- BUT WE NEED TO CLEAN UP SOME STUFF AND WE NEED TO CLARIFY SOME THINGS ARE AND THE THE REALITY IS IS THAT A LOT OF THESE ROLE LOYALTY REWARDS PROGRAMS EXIST. BECAUSE OF THIS INFORMATION NOW WHEN YOU SAY YOU'RE MY INFORMATION IS GONNA BE BLESSED TO THE WORLD WILL NOT NECESSARILY SNOT LIKE SOME IS GOING FACEBOOK AND SALE BY THE WAY. YOU KNOW YOU LIKE TO PAY YOUR PANTS OR WHATEVER THE EXAMPLE WAS THAT WAS USED IT WAS IT'S IT -- I I I NEED A CERTAIN PRODUCT AND SO THEREFORE BECAUSE I'M AND I'M AN INDIVIDUAL I'M AN AGGREGATE AND THEREFORE IT DOESN'T X. AMOUNT OF PEOPLE CAME TO OUR STORE LOOKING FOR THESE PRODUCTS AND SO THESE ARE ALL PRODUCTS THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO OFFER THESE. INDIVIDUAL HERE'S OTHER PRODUCTS THAT COULD HELP THEM WITH THEIR ISSUE OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY'RE BUYING -- AND AND SO. YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CLEAR AND CONCISE WHEN IT COMES -- TO HAVING. THESE LET'S SEE REWARDS PROGRAM STILL CONTINUE TO EXIST WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PRESERVING THAT PROTECTED PER PRESERVING THAT PRIVACY AND THAT'S A FINE LINE TO HAVE TO WALK AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE CONTINUING TO OFFER THESE BILLS. THAT'S WHY I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING ITH THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THEIR CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING IN ALL ALL THROUGH YESTERDAY AND THERE'S GOING TO CONTINUE JUST GONNA. GONNA CONTINUE TO BE A NEED TO TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS BUT I THINK THIS IS THE NECESSARY CONVERSATION THAT A SOLVING AT THE SOLVING YOUR A REAL BIG ISSUE BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY. YOU KNOW PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF PEOPLE FROM MY GENERATION WE'RE OKAY WITH INFORMATION BEING YEARS AS LONG AS WHERE AS WE UNDERSTAND IT'S BEING USED WERE GIVEN THE CHOICE OPT OUT IF WE CHOOSE TO OPT OUT. BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT THERE HAS TO ALSO BE A CLEAN LINE FOR BUSINESS OFFERING THAT TYPE OF PROGRAM TO BE ABLE TO SAY WELL. YOU KNOW THIS IS THE VALUE OF YOU BEING IN THIS PROGRAM I SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO THAN KEEP THIS PROGRAM AROUND OR BE. REQUIRED TO ADHERE TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THAT PROGRAM BY OFFERING YOU THAT DISCOUNT EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT GETTING OUT OF THE TRANCE GETTING WHAT WE HAD REQUIRED OUT OF THAT TRANSACTION AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S AN INDIVIDUAL CHOICE. AND THAT THAT OPTION AND THAT CHOICE SHOULD BE LEFT UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL -- AND UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMICS OF THE ECONOMY AND HOW IT WORKS WITH US YOUR DAD INSURED INFORMATION AND SO -- WE WANT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL WITH HOW WE TRAVERSE THIS THIS TERRITORY BECAUSE THIS MATTER SO A LOT OF PEOPLE IN A LOT OF REALLY REALLY BIG WAYS AND AS A MATTER TO ME -- YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY ZERO TOWARDS THE END OF THE MONTH AND YOU KNOW THE DIAPER NEED DOESN'T IT DOESN'T RELATE -- AND ONLY GETS WORSE SO. YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE WORK OBVIOUSLY MORE WORK NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO BE DONE AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION THE IN THE CONCERNS THAT THE RAISING AND I AND AND WANTED TO CONTINUE TO TO HAVE THAT OPEN DIALOGUE IN THAT CONVERSATION BUT A HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. IN THE FOR THE VOTING I THINK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH EDITION ON COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS HERE DO YOU WANT TO YOU WANT US TO ADDRESS IF YOU LIKE TO YEAH I'M AFRAID I WOULD IT I WOULD AGREE WITH US ONLY MEMBER CALLED ON IT IS A FINE LINE -- AND WE DO WANT TO CREATE SOME CERTAINTY FOR BUSINESS HOWEVER -- TO THE AT YOU TO THE OPPOSITION AND TO THOSE WHO ARE CONCERNED THESE ARE OFTEN PROGRAMS AND I DO -- I THEY ARE YOUR DAILY PURCHASES SOME OF THESE THINGS AND I THINK THAT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY TO A DISTRICT LIKE MINE WHERE WE HAVE A CHALLENGE AREA AND WERE SOMETIMES THIS MEANS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING ABLE TO BUY. AN EXTRA SET OF DIAPERS BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE A A DISCOUNT OFFERED BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN LOYAL TO THAT STORE THERE IS OPPORTUNITY AND THAT FOR PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT. AND SO I THINK THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS -- UNLIKE THE OPPOSITION STATED I THINK THAT OUR DESIRE TO TAKE OUT THE SECTION THAT THE CHAIR FELT LIKE. DIAL BACK ANY AGREEMENT FROM LAST YEAR WAS REALLY IMPERATIVE BECAUSE WE WANTED TO MAKE CLEAR THAT OUR GOAL IS JUST TO PRESERVE LOYALTY PROGRAMS IT IS NOT TO EXPAND IT IS NOT TO BACKTRACK ON ANY OF THE CCPA. AGREEMENTS THAT WERE MADE THAT IT REALLY IS GENUINELY JUST TO PRESERVE CUSTOMER LOYALTY PROGRAMS AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS VERY VERY CLEAR TO THE OPPOSITION WHO MAY NOT BE IT FULLY AWARE OR HAD A CHANCE BECAUSE WE HAVE WORK SO. TO THE LAST SECOND ON THIS -- ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAVE TAKEN -- SO IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THAT IS THAT IT FOR US AT THAT IS CLEAR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL COMMENTS [inaudible] SUIT [inaudible] GOD. JUST IF I COULD ADD A MIXTURE ANOTHER EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS QUITE LITERALLY UP TO THE BEGINNING OF THIS HEARING ON THIS AND SIGNIFICAN AMENDMENTS WERE TAKEN I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THE FOCUS HERE IS SIMPLY CLARIFYING AND FIXING THE REWARDS CLUB PEACE. NOT TO GO BEYOND THAT MY CONCERN Y. SIGNED UP FOR THIS IS THAT. IF CONSUMERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA FIND OUT THE REWARDS CLUB. UP BENEFITS MAY BE IN JEOPARDY BECAUSE OF THE LANDMARK LEGISLATION IT'S LEGISLATOR PAT LEGISLATURE PASSED LAST YEAR IT WOULD UNDERMINE THE CCPA. THAT'S WHY I SIGNED ON FOR THE FIX I'M TOTALLY COMMITTED. EVEN AT ITS PARED BACK A STATE -- I AM TOTALLY COMMITTED TO WORK WITH -- MISTER MCTAGGART AND OTHER OPPOSITION IF THERE'S REMAINING OPPOSITION -- ONCE HE MA'AM AND SIR DIGESTED AROUND -- NONDISCRIMINATION THAT AND WORK WITH YOU MISTER CHAIR GOING FORWARDSO WITH THAT UP THANK YOU FOR ENTERTAINING THE ISSUE AND ASK FOR AB. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- SO WITHOUT -- I WANT TO THANK YOU ALSO FOR ACCEPTING OF THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS AND THESE -- REFLECT THE MINIMUM -- LEVELS OF CHANGES THAT WILL WILLING.

YOUR BILL IS OUT EIGHT ZERO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. SO WE CAN GO TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS LET'S GO DOWN THE LINE -- NO NO I'LL DO IT NOW DO A LAST LET'S GO TO MISTER GALLAGHER I THINK HE HAS A AB [inaudible] ELEVEN THIRTY EIGHT HOUSING OKAY. OKAY WHO GOT. OKAY WELL WELCOME MISTER GALLAGHER YOU ELEVEN THIRTY ANYTIME YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- PLEASED TO PRESENT AB -- ELEVEN THIRTY EIGHT WHICH WOULD REQUIRE SOCIAL MEDIA PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE CARE TO RECEIVE PARENTAL CONSENT -- BEFORE ALLOWING MINORS UNDER THE AGE OF SIXTEEN TO CREATE SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS I DO WANT -- TO STATE AT THE OUTSET I AM ACCEPTING COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO REDUCE THAT AGE THE THIRTEEN AS WELL AS THE OTHER. COMMITTEE MEMBERS OR RECOMMENDED. AS TECHNOLOGY PROGRESSES IN THE INTERNET BECOMES MORE READILY ACCESSIBLE MINERS ARE TURNING TO SOCIAL MEDIA IN INCREASING NUMBERS WE ALL KNOW THIS. AS A TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN A STUDY SHOWED THAT 90%. OF US TEENS GO ONLINE MULTIPLE TIMES. PER DAY. THE INCREASED PRESENCE OF MINORS ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AS LEAD TO PROLIFIC AMOUNTS. OF ONLINE HARASSMENT WE'VE HAD MANY BILLS DEALING WITH CYBER BULLYING -- DEALING WITH THE PREDATORY TARGETING OF MINORS THIS THE JUST LAST YEAR IN CCPA THE SELLING OF MINORS DATA. APPROXIMATELY 59% OF MINORS AGED THIRTEEN TO SEVENTEEN PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED ABUSE OF ONLINE BEHAVIORS. AND 13% OF USE INTERNET USERS THAT RECEIVED UNWANTED SEXUAL SOLICITATIONS. WHEN IT COMES EDUCATED MINERS AND HELPING THEM THROUGH THESE ISSUES STUDY SHOWED THAT TEENS ACTUALLY THINK THEIR PARENTS DO A GOOD JOB OF ADDRESSING ONLINE HARASSMENT -- BUT ACTUALLY AREN'T FANS OF WHAT WE AS ELECTED OFFICIALS. ARE DOING. HELLO SAY HOW THIS HIT HOME FOR ME IS -- I ATTENDED A SPECIAL PRESENTATION BY A SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER IN RED BLUFF -- AND SHE DID A PRESENTATION ON WHAT'S GOING ON WHAT SHE'S SEEN HAPPENING ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES. AND SHE HELD UP. YOU KNOW A PHONE WE ALL HAVE ONE RED AND SAID. YOU KNOW YOU ALL. WHEN YOUR WHEN YOUR CHILD TURN SIXTEEN AND THEY'VE GONE TO ALL THE -- DRIVER'S ED AND AND ON THEIR TRAINING. WE HAND THEM OVER A DRIVER'S PERMIT AND WE GIVE THEM THE KEYS TO THE CAR. AND WITH THE CAR THEY CAN GO AROUND THE REGION AND YOUR GO TO DIFFERENT PLACES AND THEY HAVE ACT THEY PRETTY MUCH WE'RE GIVING THEM KEYS AND ACCESS TO THE REGION. BUT HE SAID BUT AT A MUCH YOUNGER AGE YOU GIVEN THIS PHONE. AND YOU HAVE NOW GIVEN THEM THE KEYS TO THE WORLD [inaudible] NOT JUST. THE REGION AROUND YOU BUT ACTUALLY THE WORLD AND ACCESS TO THE WORLD AND WE GIVE THEM THAT. WITH VERY LITTLE INSTRUCTION. IN MANY WAYS WE'VE SEEN THAT THERE'S BEEN MANY ABUSES THAT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE MOST PREVALENT THAT KIDS CAN'T EVEN GET AWAY FROM THE BOWLING THAT MIGHT HAPPEN AT SCHOOL. BECAUSE THEY'RE CONSTANTLY HAVING THINGS COMING OUT ON TWITTER. THEY'RE BEING HARASSED THERE IS THAT YOU CAN'T GET AWAY FROM IT -- IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S COMING ON IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL IS REALLY. ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS. IS SAYING IS NUMBER ONE TRYING TO AND ENCOURAGE PARENTS TO ENGAGE. IN THIS AND TO SAY HEY LOOK LET'S TRYING TO ESTABLISH. YOU KNOW SOME REASONABLE GUIDELINES. IN USING SOCIAL MEDIA SO THAT WE CAN BETTER PROTECT AND AND THAT THESE KIND OF CONVERSATIONS THAT WERE HAPPENING IN THAT VERY ROOM SO MANY OF THE PARENTS RAISE THEIR HAND HAD NO IDEA. ABOUT MANY OF THE THINGS THAT ARE OCCURRING ONLINE -- AND BUT AFTER HAVING THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT YOU THERE'S A WHOLE LOT. THE CONVERSATIONS THAT HAPPENED LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT ONE THAT HAPPENED. WITH MY OWN DAUGHTER WHEN I WENT HOME AND SAID HEY YOU KNOW YOU PLAY THOSE GAMES. ONLINE THEY EVER ASK YOU WHAT YOUR AGES. THIS IS ALL YEAH THEY **** AND SO WHAT DO YOU SAY WELL I SAM -- TWENTY ONE SO. YOU KNOW WITH ALL THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE. IN THE WAY THAT WE'VE JUST HEARD HOW HOW THINGS CAN BE TRACKED. HOW WE KNOW WHERE LOCATIONS ARE THE PURCHASES THAT YOU'RE MAKING THE WAY THAT ADVERTISING CAN BE TARGETED DIRECTLY YOU YOU JUST PURCHASED SOMETHING OUT A STORE? AND YOU GO ON TO YOUR FACEBOOK AND ALL THE SUDDEN THAT THAT ITEM SHOWS UP. ON YOUR FEET. WITH THAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY I DON'T THINK IT'S TOO MUCH TO ASK. FOR A SOCIAL MEDIA SITE TO FIGURE OUT. IS THIS PERSON THE AGE EIGHT THEY ARE AND TO GET PARENTAL CONSENT -- AND SO THAT'S REALLY THE IMPOTENCE OF THIS BILL. IS TO REALLY YOU KNOW PROVIDE THAT SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY WE DO THIS AND MANY OTHER INSTANCES PROBABLY THE MOST PREVALENT IS WITH TOBACCO USE RIGHT WE'VE SAID NO WE WANT YOU TO BE. TWENTY ONE BEFORE YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU HAVE TOBACCO RIGHT -- AND NOW WHEN YOU CAN BUY. THEY'VE STICKS ONLINE AND AND YOU CAN GET THOSE THINGS ALL OVER THE INTERNET GUESS WHAT. COMPANIES LIKE JUL HAVE FIGURED OUT A WAY TO ENSURE THAT THE PERSON THAT THEY'RE SELLING. YOU KNOW THAT VAPING EQUIPMENT YOU KNOW THAT [inaudible] SELL. TO IS OVER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE IS IS LEGALLY. ABLE TO HAVE THAT PRODUCT -- SO AGAIN WE'RE DOING THIS AND MANY OTHER ASPECTS. AND I THINK WITH THE WITH WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN TERMS OF THE STUDIES THE THE INCREASE IN SUICIDES. THE WAY THAT THIS IS IMPACTED ARE MINORS IT'S A REASONABLE THING TO ASK --FOR I HAVE AGAIN TAKEN A MEMBERS TO TAKE THIS DOWN TO THIRTEEN WHICH MAKES IT CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL LAW -- WHICH ALSO MAKES IT CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE C. CPA -- REGARDING SELLING TO MINORS DATA WHICH I KNOW YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WERE VERY INSTRUMENTAL IN. AND SO WITH THAT I WOULD JUST ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. BUT WHAT I THINK IS A REASONABLE BILL IN AB. ELEVEN THIRTY EIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH US ARMED SUPPORTERS WITNESSES IN SUPPORT POLICE COMPORT. HI ARTEFACTS JOHNSON WITH COMMON SENSE MEDIA -- COMMONSENSE IS COMMITTED TO HELPING KIDS AND FAMILIES THRIVE IN THE DIGITAL WORLD. I'M WITH THIS AMENDMENT DOWN TO THE AGE OF THIRTEEN FOR PARENTAL CONSENT OR HEAVILY IN SUPPORT. LOTS OF SITES AND SERVICES -- EVADE FEDERAL ACABA AND WE THINK THIS WILL HELP CLOSE THE GAP THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL SUPPORTERS. OPPOSITION PLEASE THE FORT. CAN WE CAN LEAVE INTERNET ASSOCIATION WITH THE AMENDMENTS OR NEUTRON THE BILL WE THINK THERE'S SOME THINGS TO WORK OUT WILL FOLLOW UP WITH AUTHOR. THANK YOU MATCH. SENATE RENDON FROM THE TREVOR PROJECT SIMILARLY WITH AMENDMENTS WHERE NOW NEUTRAL AND WILL BE FOLLOWING UP WITH THE AUTHOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HE WENT OUT THERE BUT WITH CAL CHAMBER WE ASSOCIATE OURSELVES THE INTERNET CESSATION OF THIS ISSUE THANK YOU THANK YOU. VERY MUCH. LET'S BRING BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER SMITH AND THEN FOLLOWED BY MR OBERNOLTE. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS MEASURE AS SOMEONE WHO HAS PARENTED TO NOW ADULT YOUNG WOMEN THROUGH WHAT WAS THAT THAT ON SET OF EVERYBODY GETTING A PHONE FOR SIXTH GRADE GRADUATION -- I KNOW I KNOW THE CHALLENGES AND I WAS SORT OF THAT FIRST GENERATION WAVE OF PARENTS WHO EXPERIENCES AND THAT AND MY KIDS DIDN'T HAVE INTERNET ON THEIR PHONES UNTIL HIGH SCHOOL EVEN THAT PRESENTED. SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES BUT IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE KNOW NOW ABOUT HOW YOUNG PEOPLE'S MINDS ARE SHAPED BY THIS INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE TO YOUR YOU KNOW WELL MADE POINT ABOUT -- CONSUMER ASPECTS OF IT AND AND GOODS AND MATERIALS THAT WEREN'T MEANT TO BE IN THE HANDS OF MINORS TO BEGIN WITH THEY NOW HAVE DIRECT ACCESS -- TO I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'VE BEEN WILLING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO MAKE THIS A WORKABLE BILL TO GIVE WHAT PARENTS HAVE ASKED FOR OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHICH IS MORE TOOLS AND OPPORTUNITIES. FOR KIND OF HAVING SOME CONTROL OVER THEIR CHILDREN'S ONLINE EXPERIENCES SO I THINK YOU IN A MINUTE MOVE TO SUPPORT POSITION ON THIS THANKS. ALMOST OBERNOLTE GUIDE I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO -- MISTER GALLAGHER I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS I THINK THEY MAKE THE BILL BETTER. I I STILL HAVE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS. AND DECIDE JUST LIKE TO OFFER SUGGESTION AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD OF A WAY THAT THAT MIGHT MAKE IT BETTER. THE BILL'S IS PRETTY STARK IT SAYS THAT THE BUSINESS SHALL NOT ALLOW A PERSON UNDER NOW IT'S THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE TO CREATE AN ACCOUNT. SO. THE PROBLEM IS THAT A BUSINESS REALLY HAS NO WAY OF KNOWING FOR SURE. THAT SOMEONE'S THIRTEEN OR OR OLDER. SO I'D BE A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE IF IT THERE WAS LANGUAGE LIKE SHALL TAKE REASONABLE STEPS OR ME EVEN TIGHTER THAN THAT BUT I MEAN JUST. BUT YOU USED YOU RAISE THE THE EXAMPLE OF YOUR DAUGHTER LYING AND SAYING SHE WAS TWENTY ONE OKAY SO MAYBE. THE MAYBE THE THE THOUGH THAT WASN'T A STRONG ENOUGH STANDARD THAT THE THAT THE SOCIAL MEDIA SITE WAS USING. BUT I MEAN LET'S SAY THAT THEY ASK FOR A DRIVER'S LICENSE NUMBERS SO SHE STOLE HER MOTHERS AND PUT IT IN THERE OKAY IS THAT A REASONABLE STEP. BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE A BAR THERE IT WHICH WE SAY THAT THE BUSINESS HAS MET THAT BAR. YOU KNOW AND AND IF. THE SOMEONE THAT WASN'T THIRTEEN OPEN AN ACCOUNT THAT YOU KNOW THE BUSINESS WASN'T AT FAULT THERE BECAUSE THEY DID EVERYTHING THAT THEY COULD. SO -- I I'D LIKE TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO TO MAYBE EXPLORE THAT TERRITORIES BILL MOVES FORWARD. NO I'M I'M DEFINITELY OPEN TO THAT -- AYE AYE AND YOU PROBABLY WOULD KNOW THIS MUCH BETTER THAN ME YOU KNOW HOW HOW THIS COULD BE DONE YOU KNOW FROM THAT TECHNICAL LOGICAL STANDPOINT I GUESS I'M JUST APPROACHING IT MAN. WITH EVERYTHING THAT I'VE SEEN. I FIND HARD TO BELIEVE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF MECHANISM. THE COULD HELP VERIFY AGE SURE WHY ARE YOU KNOW WHAT I'M I'M A WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT RIGHT STATION. RIGHT AND I'LL TELL YOU THIS THERE IS NO 1100% FOOLPROOF WAY TO DO IT. SO I I JUST LIKE TO BE THERE TO BE SOME KIND OF REASON ABILITY STANDARD THAT WE CAN AGREE THAT A BUSINESS THAT HAVING DONE ALL THESE DOES THESE THINGS HAS BEEN REASONABLE AND IS MET THE STANDARD OF THE BILL. WITHOUT SAYING THAT ANYTHING THAT GETS THROUGH THE BUSINESSES FALL. BUT YEAH I THINK I'M GOING TO DO THAT AS WE AS WE MOVE RIGHT. A MISTER CALDERON. YEAH I WANNA THANK YOU FOR THIS BILL I THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL I MEAN I I HAVE KIDS AND I AND IT'S GREAT NOW BUT AS SOON AS THEY START TO GET A LITTLE BIT OLDER AND START GOING TO SCHOOL AND START BEING. MORE INTERACTIVE WITH THE STATURE TABLET WHETHER IT'S A TABLET OR PHONE OR ANY TYPE OF DEVICE -- I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THAT A BECAUSE THE INFORMATION THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE EXPOSED TO AS GOOD AS I MAY THINK I AM AT AT AT CENSORING THEM JUST LIKE MY DAD THOUGHT HE WAS GOOD AT CENSORING US WHEN IT CAME TO DIRECT TV. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE TO PUT IN THE CODE TO WATCH MOVIES ABOUT BG. AT OUR WHATEVER IT WAS AND YOU KNOW. IN A DEAD YOU DON'T REMEMBER A LOT OF THINGS IT'S CLEARLY YOUR BIRTHDAY -- NINETEEN FIFTY BUT IT YET I I BUT I BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE HOW THE HELL COMPANIES -- WHAT THE WHAT THE LIABILITY IS AND HOW COMPANIES IT CAN POSSIBLY BE ABLE -- TO TO RISE TO THE STANDARD OF BEING ABLE TO GUARANTEE THAT A KID WHO WAS IN THIRTEEN IS AGAIN IT IS IS IS GETTING A PARENTAL CONSENT AYE AYE. I MEAN I WANT TO BELIEVE IT'S POSSIBLE I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S POSSIBLE AND I DON'T KNOW AND SO I THINK IT'S GONNA BE IT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL IN TERMS OF WHAT LIABILITY WILL PLACE ON THE COMPANY. AS WELL AS THE STANDARD BECAUSE I I'M JUST I'M JUST. NOT CONVINCED THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO REACH THAT STANDARD PRECISELY GETS IMPORTANT AND AND THIS IS. THESE ARE DEFINITELY ONE OF THE TYPES OF ISSUES -- THAT HOUSES THE LEGISLATIVE BODY HAS TO START ADDRESSING BECAUSE THE MENTAL HEALTH OF OUR KIDS ARE IT'S CLEARLY BEING AFFECTED AND IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT THAT IT'S THE PLATFORMS FAULT IT'S THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE USING THE PLATFORM ABUSING A PLATFORM AND USING IT FOR OTHER NEFARIOUS REASONS ARE HAVING IMPACTS MASSIVE IMPACTS ON KIDS AND SO WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE ABOUT WHAT KIND OF SENATOR PLACING ON THESE PLATFORMS. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SEEN AN ARM I WANT TO THANK YOU -- MISTER GALLAGHER FOR ACCEPTING DIMENSIONS I FEEL COMFORTABLE -- WITH THE BILL WITH THE AMENDMENTS ARE BEING ADDED AND I IN FACT LAST YEAR I I I I HAD A COUPLE OF LEGISLATION. TO DEAL WITH SOMETHING SIMILAR -- ALONG THE LINES OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE KIDS AND IF ONE OF WHICH WAS. ON TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION WHERE A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BOY WAS ABLE TO PURCHASE GUNS ONLINE I THINK FROM AMAZON. AND SO WE ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE AND THEN THE OTHER -- ONE BASICALLY TRY TO TACKLE THE ISSUE OF SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE THE THE KIDS -- LET'S LET'S A LIKENESS OF PHOTOS ARE IN A DIFFERENT CONTEXT FOR EXAMPLE WITH FRIENDS OF FRIENDS OF SO. THAT WAS AB 2511% SO -- I THINK THAT'S AN AREA THAT WE NEED TO REALLY CONTINUE TO KIND OF WORK WITH THE TECH INDUSTRY ALSO -- BUT I I THINK THERE IS STILL A LITTLE BIT I THINK THE BILL HAS STILL TO TO BE A FINE TO A LITTLE BIT MORE. BUT I'M YOU KNOW MORE COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING IT TODAY AND AN URGE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH I SAY TO TECH FOLKS AND ALSO THE COMMUNITY -- COULD THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AS WELL SO WE'VE GOT -- SEE NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO CLOSE. HELLO WHICH I CLOSE THIS RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR EITHER. ARE A DATE OUR THE BILL IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS A MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CHAO I SHALL I KILEY KILEY I'VE BAUER-KAHAN I BAUER-KAHAN I BERMAN. BERMAN I CALDERON [inaudible] GABRIEL [inaudible] GALLAGHER. HI GALLAGHER I IRWIN -- WHEN I OBERNOLTE? OBERNOLTE AYE SMITH. SMITH I WICKS. YOU HAVE FIVE EIGHT VOTES THE BILL IS OUT. I THINK YOU HAVE ANOTHER BILL BUT THAT'S NOT A CCPA RELATED BILLS SO THAT'S GOING TO BE AS PART OF THE THE REGULAR BUSINESS AGENDA SO IF I COULD ASK YOU COME BACK LATER. ALL AS SOON AS WE'RE DONE WITH THIS IS SUPERIOR TO BILLS AND THAT BRINGS US TO MISTER BERMAN WHO HAS TWO BILLS. IN CONNECTION WITH CCPA. FIRST ONE IS ITEM NUMBER SEVEN AND THAT IS A. B.. ELEVEN FORTY SIX SAME MOTION. OKAY. OKAY GOT IT. I DON'T DO IT FOR YOU THEN. ONE ANYTIME YOU'RE READY MISTER BERMAN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE'S CHIEF CONSULTANT. FOR HER WORK ON THIS BILL IN ADVANCE OF THE HEARING FOR THE THOROUGH ANALYSIS AND I'M PLEASED TO TAKE THE AUTHORS AMENDMENT. NOTED ON PAGE TEN OF THE STAFF REPORT. COLLEAGUES ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DUTIES GOVERNMENT IS CHARGED IS KEEPING THE PUBLIC SAFE. AB ELEVEN FORTY SIX WOULD MAKE EXPLICIT WHAT I BELIEVE WAS THE CHAIRS AND TEN TWENTY AUTHOR LANDMARK CONSUMER PRIVACY BILL LAST YEAR. SPECIFICALLY THE BILL WOULD MAKE CLEAR THAT A NEW MOTOR VEHICLE DEALER MAY RETAIN VEHICLE INFORMATION. INCLUDING OWNERSHIP INFORMATION IN ORDER TO SHARE IT WITH AN AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURER FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENABLING EITHER WARRANTY WORK OR MANUFACTURERS RECALL. NEW VEHICLES ARE COVERED BY MANUFACTURER WARRANTY THAT ALLOWS FOR REPAIRS TO MAKE TO BE MADE TO THE VEHICLE AT NO COST TO THE CONSUMER. LIKEWISE WHEN THERE'S A SAFETY DEFECT RECALL THE VEHICLE CAN BE REPAIRED AT NO COST TO THE CONSUMER. IN BOTH INSTANCES THE MANUFACTURERS FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE AND THE REPAIRS ARE DONE BY DEALERS BUT INFORMATION SHARING IS NECESSARY TO NOTIFY AND TO REPAIR. ACCORDINGLY FOR THE VERY LIMITED PURPOSES OF VEHICLE WARRANTY WORK AND RECALLS THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE AN ERROR EXEMPTION FROM CCPA. THE CONSUMER WOULD STILL RETAIN THE RIGHT TO ACCESS THE PERSONAL INFORMATION AND KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN COLLECTED AND SHARED AND CONSUMER REMEDIES WOULD REMAIN IN PLACE AS WELL. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE AND I HAVE WITH ME TODAY MIKE BELOW ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION. AND AND AND MORE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- FIRST WITNESS PLAY ON TOOK ME BY SURPRISE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MIGHT PULL OUT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WHOLE ISSUE IS. COMPLEX AND AND SENSITIVE BUT I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT. THERE IS A HUGE PUBLIC BENEFIT IN GETTING RECALLED CARS FIXED AND HISTORICALLY WE'VE HAD A RATHER POOR TRACK RECORD IN TERMS OF PERCENTAGE OF RECALLED CARS BEING FIXED. SO EVERYTHING WE CAN DO TO FIND CAR OWNERS AND GET THOSE RECALLS FIXED OBVIOUSLY. RE DOWNS TO THEIR SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF OTHERS ON THE ROAD. WE APPRECIATE THE ANALYSIS AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE BILL IS FULLY CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE LAST YEAR AND OUR LAWYERS HAVE GONE OVER THIS REPEATEDLY AND TALK TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF ABOUT. THE DEGREE TO WHICH EXISTING LAW MAY COVER IT AND WE THINK. RESPECTFULLY IT'S NOT EXACTLY CLEAR AND THE LAST THING WE WANT IS TO ARGUE ABOUT IT LITIGATE ABOUT IT AFTER THE FILE A SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION THAT SORT OF THING. PRACTICALLY SPEAKING THE ONLY WAY A CAR MANUFACTURER KNOWS THAT YOU HAVE PURCHASED A NEW CAR IS WE TELL THEM AS DEALERS AND IT IS THIS BACK AND FORTH COMMUNICATION THAT ALLOWS US. TO TELL THE MANUFACTURE WHERE% THE RECALL NOTICE SHOULD BE SENT. THIS IS VERY VERY NARROW IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY DATA BREACH LIABILITY DOESN'T TAKE AWAY OTHER CONSUMER RIGHTS ALL IT SAID JESS IS THAT YOU CANNOT. OPT OUT OR DELETE INFORMATION WHEN WE NEED TO TELL THE CAR MANUFACTURE -- AN ADDRESS IN TERMS OF GETTING A HOLD OF YOU WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S WORK WE APPRECIATE THE WORK OF MISTER MCTAGGART AND HIS LOBBYING TEAM -- AND PLEDGE TO CONTINUE TO WORK TO MAKE THIS THE NARROWEST POSSIBLE EXEMPTION THAT IT COULD BE WITH THAT WE WOULD ASK FOR AN IPHONE. THANK YOU BETCHA NEXT WITNESS PLEASE MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE JOHN MOFFITT ON BEHALF OF THE ALLIANCE OF AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS I'VE LEARNED THAT ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS NOT -- TO NOT TO ARGUE WITH MISTER BELOW IN THIS IS ONE CASE WHERE HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

OVER ITS FURTHER SOUTH -- SO FIRST JUST TO THE POINT OF THIS WILL NOT BE NEEDED ON THE THOUGH WIDE EXCEPTION -- IN THE C. C. P.'S RIGHT TO TO LEAVE FOR PURPOSES RECENTLY ANTICIPATED WITHIN THE BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP -- ACCOMMODATE THIS INFORMATION SHARING RETENTION -- AND WITH RESPECT TO THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT THE BUSINESS PURPOSE EXEMPTION WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF SALE ACCOMMODATES THIS AS WELL -- AND THAT EXEMPTION IMPORTANTLY PUT SPECIFIC -- LIMITS ON FURTHER SALE -- SO -- IN CONTRAST WERE CONCERNED THAT THE BILL THIS BILL WOULD REMOVE THESE PROTECTIONS -- AND WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS IN OPPOSITION.

YOU HAVE SEVEN VOTES THE BILL IS OUT CONGRATULATIONS AND YOU HAVE A SECOND BILL -- ITEM NUMBER NINE AB. FIFTEEN SIXTY FOUR SESSION OKAY GOT IT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES OUTSIDE AGAIN LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND ACCEPT THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENT. INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS IN ORDER FOR CONSUMERS TO EXERCISE THESE NEW RIGHTS THE CCPA REQUIRES A COVERED BUSINESS TO PROVIDE A TOLL FREE PHONE NUMBER. FOR CONSUMERS TO MAKE ACCESS AND DELETION REQUESTS GIVEN THE POTENTIAL LEGAL LIABILITY FROM PROPER DISCLOSURES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR BUSINESSES TO MAINTAIN PROPER DOCUMENTATION OF THE REQUEST THE VERIFICATION PROCESS IN THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN RESPONSE. THEREFORE AS PROPOSED TO BE MEN AMENDED AB FIFTEEN SIXTY FOUR WOULD ALLOW A BUSINESS COVERED BY THE CCP. TO MAINTAIN EITHER A TOLL FREE PHONE NUMBER OR AN EMAIL ADDRESS AND A PHYSICAL ADDRESS FOR CONSUMERS TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE CCPA. A BUSINESS THAT OPERATES EXCLUSIVELY ONLINE HOWEVER WOULD BE EXEMPT FROM THE REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE A PHYSICAL ADDRESS IN ADDITION TO AN EMAIL ADDRESS THIS FLEXIBILITY WOULD ALLOW BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE AN OPTION. THAT FITS THE CONTEXT OF THE CONSUMER BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP MEANING HOW THE CONSUMER ENGAGES WITH THE BUSINESS GENERALLY. AND WORK WITH AND BEST PRACTICES TO VERIFY AND RESPOND TO REQUESTS WITH ME TODAY'S KEVIN MCKINLEY ON BEHALF OF THE INTERNET ASSOCIATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU FIRST WHEN HIS PLACE THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS OF COMMITTING MY NAME'S KEVIN KILLING DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT FAIRS FOR INTERNET ASSOCIATION -- A. B. FIFTEEN SIXTY FOUR REMOVES A STRICT REQUIREMENT THAT ALL BUSINESSES ALLOW FOR CONSUMER REQUEST VIA TOLL FREE NUMBER. TOLL FREE REQUIREMENTS CCPA CAN BE CUMBERSOME AND MAY PRESENT BOTH SECURITY AND PRIVACY CONCERNS FOR BUSINESSES RECEIVING A CONSUMER QUESTS. WHEN CONSUMERS INTERACT VIA WEBSITE OR APP WITH THE BUSINESS? AN ONLINE METHOD FOR ACCESSING VERIFICATION WOULD BE EFFICIENT SECURITY POSITIVE AND CONSISTENT WITH CONSUMER EXPECTATIONS. SO I URGE THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE YES THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THERE BUT ON BEHALF OF CAL CHAMBER WOULD ECHO THE SENTIMENTS BY ERIN ASSOCIATION APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF THIS AUTHOR BECAUSE WE THINK THIS WILL BE HELPFUL FOR SMALL BUSINESSES THANK YOU.

OPPOSITION [inaudible] WELCOME. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON -- MR CHILD. AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ARE AFFECTS JOHNSON I'M WITH COMMON SENSE MEDIA CO SPONSOR OF THE CCPA -- RESPECTFULLY WE MUST OPPOSE THE BILL AS AS DRAFTED IN AS AMENDED AS AS DETAILED OUR POSITION LETTER WHICH UNFORTUNATELY WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT TO HAVE A NON INTERNET WAY TO CONTACT BUSINESS UNDER THE CCPA CONSUMERS GET A NUMBER OF NEW RIGHTS. THEY CAN ASK FOR IT THEY CAN ASK BUSINESSES TOP SELLING AT THEY CAN ASK A BUSINESS TO DELETE IT. BUT THEY HAVE TO EXERCISE THESE RIGHTS THEY HAVE TO AFFIRMATIVELY A START BUTTON AND THE CCPA WAS DRAFTED TO MAKE THAT PROCESS AS EASY AS POSSIBLE REQUIRING AT LEAST TWO POINTS OF CONTACT. TO ENSURE THAT USER RIGHTS CAN ACTUALLY BE MEANINGFULLY EXERCISED. ONE OF THOSE POINTS OF CONTACT ON THIS CCPA AS A TOLL FREE TELEPHONE NUMBER. AND THE KEY PART HERE I THINK IS THAT IT IS A TELEPHONE NUMBER. AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THAT. THE AMENDMENTS WOULD ALLOW FOR CONSUMERS TO CONTACT BUSINESSES. REGARDING POSTAL MAIL ALSO KNOWN AS A SNAIL MAIL BECAUSE IT TAKES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME. BUT THIS IS NOT A SUFFICIENT -- THIS DOES NOT WOULD NOT REPLACE THE TELEPHONE NUMBER. AND SHE DOESN'T SEVENTEEN NEARLY A THIRD OF SENIOR AMERICANS AGE SIXTY FIVE AND OVER. AND ADULTS WITH LESS THAN A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION DO NOT REGULATED USE THE INTERNET AND ROUGHLY THREE IN TEN ADULTS WITH LOWER HOUSEHOLD INCOMES UNDER THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. DO NOT ON SMARTPHONES IN ORDER FOR THESE PEOPLE THAT MEANING FLEA EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE A PHONE CALL 95% OF AMERICANS HAVE ACCESS TO A SOFT ON INFORMATION OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AS COLLECTED BOUGHT AND SOLD JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE'S. AND THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS BY MAKING A CALL AND NOT HAVE TO SEND SOMETHING IN THE MAIL AND HOPE THAT SOME DAY ARRIVES AND HOPE THAT SOMEDAY THAT THEY GET A RESPONSE [inaudible] WE OPPOSE. THANK YOU MY CHáVEZ TIONAL OPPOSITION. I WANT TO STATE FOR THE RECORD THAT -- THE OPPOSITION LETTERS WERE DISTRIBUTED TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I BELIEVE THAT -- THEY ARRIVED LATE SO THAT'S THE REASON WE DID NOT INCLUDE THEM IN THE ANALYSIS. AND OUT SO WITH THAT I I THINK THIS IS A BILL THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY UP BILL COMPROMISE SON I THINK TAUGHT SO IT'S A IT'S A IS IS NOT REALLY. I MEAN I I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW THE AUTHOR CAN DEFINITELY WORK WITH OPPOSITION -- IN ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CONCERNS I SO I I WANT TO ENCOURAGE TO THE AUTHOR DO SO. AND BUT I THINK YOU KNOW. CONSIDERING THE FACT THIS IS THE FIRST COMMITTEE SO I I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING THE BILL BUT I DO ENCOURAGE TO BOTH SIDES TO KIND OF GET TOGETHER AND KIND OF SEE IF WE CAN WORK SOMETHING OUT. AREN'T SO -- QUESTION FROM MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR TO A HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY -- HAD A QUESTION THOUGH THE OPPOSITION IS OBJECTING. TO THE POTENTIAL FOR A BUSINESS HAVING AN EMAIL ADDRESS AND NOT. A TELEPHONE NUMBER TO REQUEST DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION IS THE CONVERSE ALSO ALLOWED UNDER THE BILL IN OTHER WORDS CAN YOU HAVE A TOLL FREE NUMBER AND NOT AN EMAIL ADDRESS BECAUSE MY READING OF THE BILL. WOULD INDICATE THAT YOU COULD YEAH YOU. YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER OR ANY EMAIL. SO YEAH IT'S IT'S KIND OF A A OR B. AND C. OKAY SO IF YOU HAVE A TELEPHONE NUMBER. YOU DON'T NEED THE EMAIL ADDRESS OR THE PHYSICAL ADDRESS SO LET ME JUST SUGGEST THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE. THE MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT DID YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT IS THAT -- MOVES FORWARD BECAUSE SINCE WERE PREDOMINATELY TALKING ABOUT ELECTRONIC INFORMATION HERE -- I DON'T MEAN I CAN IMAGINE MAYBE A BAD ACTOR TRYING TO DISCOURAGE CONSUMERS FROM REQUESTING A DISCLOSURE OF THAT INFORMATION. YEAH AND IMPLEMENTING A TOLL FREE NUMBER BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT FEWER PEOPLE WALK WILL TAKE THE TIME TO CALL THE NUMBER THEY ON GO ONLINE OR SEND AN EMAIL SO -- I I REALLY THINK THAT THAT MEANT THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT. YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO ALLOW BUT ANYWAY HAVE A HAVE A HAVE A LOOK BUT HAPPY JUST PORTABILITY THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND DEFINITELY SOMETHING A LOT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT. THE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS SEEN AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. HI THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS IT WILL YOU WE'VE. WORKED WITH WITH FOLKS YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL UP TO NOW WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WORK WITH FOLKS. WHO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL AND IN THE MEANTIME RESPECT FAST FOR A VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DO I HAVE A MOTION? HAS BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED SARAH. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROACH -- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL CHAU HI SO I KILEY. BAUER-KAHAN. BAUER-KAHAN AYE BERMAN AYE. BERMAN HI CALDERON. CALDERON HI GABRIEL. GABRIEL I GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER I IRWIN [inaudible] OBERNOLTE. OBERNOLTE HIGHSMITH. WICKS. HAVE SEVEN VOTES THE BILL IS OUT CONGRATULATIONS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ON THAT BRINGS US. TO THE TO MY BILL I THINK AB TWENTY FIVE LET ME -- ALL DAY. I'M GONNA GIVE IT [inaudible] OF STAY DOWN THERE YEAH. OUR MODEL SEE. MR ONE HELL TO WHICH I COULD CARE. OKAY. ALL OKAY THAT'S RIGHT THANKS [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] BOB THIS. RIGHT WORD FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE AB TWENTY FIVE CHAO PLEASE PROCEED. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF HOW JUST TO KEEP A VERY BRIEF Là AB TWENTY FIVE IS ACTUALLY CLARIFIES. THAT THE DEFINITION OF CONSUMER EXCLUDES INDIVIDUALS. WHO SELL PERSONAL INFORMATION HAVE BEEN COLLECTED BY A DAY -- BY BUSINESS AND OF COURSE OF THEIR ACTIVITIES FOR THE BUSINESS AS AN EMPLOYEE CONTRACTOR. AGENT OR JOB APPLICANT BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT THEIR INFORMATION IS COLLECTED AND USED SOLELY FOR PURPOSES RELATED TO THOSE ACTIVITIES. SO SINCE THE PASSAGE OF US THE CPA THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS REQUESTS FOR FURTHER CLARIFICATION ON THE RIGHTS PROTECTIONS. AND OBLIGATIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE CCPA. ONE ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN REPLACED IS THE NEED TO CLARIFY THE DEFINITION OF CONSUMER. OF DOES NOT INCLUDE AN EMPLOYEE ACTING WITHIN THE SCOPE OF AN EMPLOYEE. MANY BUSINESSES HAVE ARGUED THAT CCPA COULD BE READ TO ALSO APPLY TO CALIFORNIANS IN THEIR CAPACITY AS EMPLOYEES BOTH TO CAPTURE THEIR EMPLOYEE -- DATA AND ALSO TO POTENTIALLY CAPTURE BUSINESS DATA OF ANOTHER BUSINESS IN THE CONTEXT OF BUSINESS TO BUSINESS INTERACTIONS. WELL WE NEVER ENVISIONED THIS BEING AN ISSUE IT HAS BEEN EXPRESSED THAT AS DRAFTED IN EMPLOYEE ACCUSED OF LET'S SAY SEXUAL HARASSMENT. COULD THE REQUEST THAT THE COMPLAINT ABOUT THEM ABI EXPUNGE TO A PURSUANT TO THE RIGHT TO DELETE FOR EXAMPLE ACCORDING TO A SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT ONE POINT. OH FIVE OF FROM THE COMPANY'S FILES ARE THIS CLASSIFICATION IS STATURE WOULD ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS RETAIN RIGHTS UNDER THE CBC'S. IN THEIR CAPACITY AS A CONSUMER BUT NOT. IN THEIR CAPACITY AS AN EMPLOYEE ANOTHER ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN RACES THE CONCERNED A HIGHLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION LIKE CREDIT CARD -- SO SECURE NUMBER COULD FALL INTO THE WRONG HANDS WHEN A REQUEST IS MADE FOR SPECIFIC INFANT SPECIFIC PIECES OF INFORMATION. ON THE THE BUSINESSES COLLECTED ABOUT A CONSUMER. ALL THIS CONCERN EXTENDS TO THE DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION SUCH AS THE CONSUMER'S BROWSING HISTORY WITH OTHER HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS OR OTHER. MEMBERS OF THE A SHARE DEVICE FOR EXAMPLE PARTICULARLY WHAT INFORMATION COULD LAND IN THE LIGHT AND THE HANDS OF THE ABUSIVE SPOUSE OR PARENTS WERE IN THE HANDS OF A ROOMMATE FOR EXAMPLE. ARE WHILE THE CCP REQUIRES SAID BUSINESS COME COMPLY. ONLY UPON THE RECEIPT OF A VERIFIABLE CONSUMER REQUESTS ARE CONCERNED RACES THAT BUSINESS MAIN DE COLLECT INFO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM THE REQUESTING CONSUMER. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PERSONAL AND POTENTIALLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION IS SENT TO THE RIGHT PERSON. ESPECIALLY WHEN BUSINESS HAS NO DIRECT REAL XIN SHIP THOUGH WITH THE CONSUMER OR IN SITUATIONS INVOLVING A SURE. A HOUSEHOLD OR DEVICE SO THIS BILL SEEKS TO CLARIFY HOW BUSINESS SHALL COMPLY WITH CONSUMERS REQUEST FOR SPECIFIC INFORMATION. ARE PIECES OF INFORMATION UNDER CC PA IN THE PRIVATE IN A PRIVATE OF PRIVACY PROTECTED MANNER. OF PARTICULARLY WHEN -- A CERTAIN INFORMATION MIGHT BE TIED TO A HOUSEHOLD DEVICES THAT CONSUMERS SHARES WITH OTHERS SO WITH THAT I I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER CELLO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MISTER KING. AND MEMBERS -- SERRA -- TESTIFYING. WITH CAL CHAMBER BRIEFLY AND I HAVE HERE. AS AN EXPERT TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT COME UP JIM HALPERT WHO'S THE GLOBAL CO CHAIR CO CHAIR OF DELAY PAPERS PRIVACY AND CYBERSECURITY PRACTICE -- JUST WANT TO FIRST THANK MR CHOW -- AND HIS STAFF FOR ALL OF THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL -- WHICH INCLUDES A CRUCIAL FIX -- TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY THE DEFINITION OF CONSUMER THOSE HAVE RIGHTS UNDER THIS LAW LIKE THE RIGHT TO ACCESS OR DELETE INFORMATION COULD BE INTERPRETED TO INCLUDE EMPLOYEES WITHOUT THIS CLARIFICATION AND THAT'S PROBLEMATIC FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST THE OPERATIONAL COSTS FOR BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY SMALL BUSINESSES -- OF INCLUDING EMPLOYEES AND JOB APPLICANTS WOULD BE EXORBITANT. IMAGINE A FAMILY OWNED RESTAURANT THAT SERVES A HUNDRED FIFTY TABLES PER DAY WITHOUT THIS FIX THAT MIGHT HAVE TO AB OPERATIONALIZE THE CCPA FOR THE KITCHEN AND WAIT STAFF IN A BUSINESS WITH HIGH TURNOVER AND LOW PROFIT MARGINS. SECOND IT COULD LEAD TO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION IN THE EMPLOYMENT CONTEXT IS ALREADY ESTABLISHED UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW WITHOUT THIS FIX THIS EASY PAY COULD ALLOW SEPARATED SPOUSES PART OF HOUSEHOLDS TO GAIN ACCESS TO PAYROLL RECORDS. ALSO GIVING EMPLOYEES THE RIGHT TO DELETE CERTAIN INFORMATION COULD BE PROBLEMATIC FOR EXAMPLE AN EMPLOYEE COULD ASK A BUSINESS DAILY ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL -- ADDRESSES PROACTIVELY THE CONCERNS WE BELIEVE PRIVACY ADVOCATES WOULD HAVE FOR EXAMPLE THE LANGUAGE IN A LOT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT SOMEONE MIGHT BE BOTHAN EMPLOYEE AND A CONSUMER. OF THE BUSINESS AND ENSURE THAT SUCH PERSON WOULD STILL RETAIN ALL THE RIGHTS TO THE C. P. AS A CONSUMER AND IT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE CONCERN THAT SOME EMPLOYERS MIGHT USE. DATA -- THAT'S NOT RELATED LIKE DATA FOR PURPOSES NOT RELATED TO EMPLOYMENT AND SORENESS A LANGUAGE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE -- CREATING A LIMITATION THAT ONLY DATA COLLECTED IN THE CONTEXT OF EMPLOYMENT COULD BE EXEMPTED FROM THE C. CPA. THROUGH NEGOTIATION SET UP WITH MISTER CHALLEN STAFF -- WE MET WITH PRIVACY ADVOCATES INCLUDING MR TARA WHO REQUESTED WE NARROW THAT LANGUAGE TO DATA COLLECTED AND USED SOLELY FOR PURPOSES RELATED TO IT EMPLOYMENT WE ACCEPTED THAT CHANGE -- FINALLY WE APPRECIATE AB TWENTY FIVE HAS INTENT LANGUAGE TO ENSURE WHEN A CONSUMER REQUEST SPECIFIC PIECES OF INFORMATION FROM A BUSINESS IT'LL BE DONE IN A SAFE MANNER WE HOPE TO ADDRESS -- THAT CONCERNED WITH OUR CONCERNS WITH HOUSEHOLDS AS WELL AS OUR CONCERNS ABOUT BUSINESS TO BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS IN AB TWENTY FIVE AND WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF. AS WELL AS MISTER MISTER KARGER ANY OTHER PRIVACY ADVOCATES ON THESE ISSUES AND AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER TELL FOR YOUR EFFORTS -- ON THIS BILL AND MEMBERS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

WHERE ELSE RETIRED FROM CALIFORNIA'S OUR CONSUMER PRIVACY -- WE DON'T WE HAVEN'T OR DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL -- BUT THE ONE THING I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST IS THAT THE BOARD AGENT -- IS HANGING OUT THERE RIGHT NOW UNDEFINED AND IT'S LOST ON US WHAT AGENT IS THE CONTRACTOR IS NOT A CONTRACTOR IS DEFINED AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT AGENT IS SOMETHING OTHER THAN CONTRACT WITH YOU COULD BE TO FIND OTHER WAYS WE THINK IT SHOULD BE STRICKEN. BUT OTHER THAN THAT WE APPRECIATE THE CHAIR MEMBERS THE THE COULD COMMITTEE STAFF MEMBERS FOR ALL THEIR WORK. CAR FIND THIS ALMOST AND TODAY WAS PASSED THIS IS BEEN AN ISSUE THAT. MANY PRODUCTS THAT WE THINK IT'S HARD BUT IT'S BETTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ARE AFFECTS JOHNSON WITH. COMMON SENSE MEDIA -- FIRST I ALSO WANTED TO THINK THAT CHAIR AND HIS STAFF FOR WORKING SINCE OUSTER MENTION SINCE THE BILL IS PASSED WITH ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS ON HOW TO FIGURE OUT THE EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE EXCEPTION -- I RESPECTFULLY WE MUST OPPOSE THE LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW AS IT IS DRAFTED -- WE AGREE THAT THERE IS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN AN EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP AND WITH A BUSINESS AND CONSUMER. AND WE HAVE NO CONCERNS REGARDING YOU KNOW PAYROLL RECORDS BEING EXCLUDED OR A FAMILY OWNED RESTAURANTS HR FILE NOT BEING PART OF THE CCPA. WERE CONCERNED HOWEVER THAT AS DRAFTED. THERE IS FAR TOO MUCH SPACE FOR INDUSTRY TO ABUSE THE OPENING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN THAT WE THINK THAT ANY EXCEPTION SHOULD APPLY ONLY TO INFORMATION. THAT'S NECESSARY FOR AN EMPLOYER TO COLLECT BETWEEN AN EMPLOYER OR A CONTRACTOR AN EMPLOYEE -- WITHOUT A REQUIREMENT THAT INFORMATION HAS TO BE NECESSARY FOR EMPLOYMENT OR FOR CONTRACTING EMPLOYERS HAVE NO LIMITS ON WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION THEY CAN COLLECT AND USE FROM EMPLOYEES. OUTSIDE OF THE SAFEGUARDS OF THE CZ PA GIVEN THE EVER INCREASING CORPORATE SURVEILLANCE OF THE WORK FORCE INCLUDING. COLLECTING MOVEMENT OUT ON EMPLOYEES REQUIRING EMPLOYEES TO WEAR. BADGES THAT HAVE MICROPHONES -- COMPANIES TRYING TO LEARN WHEN THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE PLANNING TO CONCEIVE IT IS OBVIOUS THAT EMPLOYERS FEEL FREE TO TIE JUST ABOUT ALL TYPES OF INFORMATION. TO EMPLOYMENT SO THE RISK OF ABUSE IS REAL IN ADDITION UNDER THE PRESENT DEFINITION WERE CONCERNED THAT EMPLOYERS COULD MINE LOTS OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR EMPLOYEES. AND USE THAT TO MARKET PRODUCTS TO THEM AGAIN AS LONG AS THE EMPLOYER IS MARKETING TO ITS EMPLOYEES. WE DO NOT THINK THAT THIS IS THE AUTHOR'S INTENT TO GIVE CARP WANTS TO SUCH INTRUSIVE BEHAVIOR. AND SO WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THE EXEMPTION LANGUAGE BE BE NARROWED. THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AT SMITH THE COURT ON BEHALF OF PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARING HOUSE IN THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION I WOULD AFFILIATE MY COMMENTS WITH MY COLLEAGUES AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR THANK YOU -- JACOBS KNOW A SO YOU OF CALIFORNIA ALSO AFFILIATE -- WITH A COLLEAGUES AT US YES I'M AND OPEN FOR FOR THE CONVERSATIONS.

WHAT TECHNOLOGY STANDS TO IMPROVE HOW HERE OF CARE IS DELIVER? ALL THESE ADVANCES DO NOT COME WITHOUT RISK HEALTH AND MEDICAL INFORMATION IS BY ITS VERY NATURE DEEPLY PERSONAL AND SENSITIVE. NEW TECHNOLOGY MAKES MEDICAL INFORMATION EASILY AND QUICKLY ACCESSIBLE VIA APPLICATIONS AND WEBSITES IN CALIFORNIA HOUSE. ENSURE THAT MEDICAL INFORMATION NEED HELP BY MOBILE DEVICES IS PROTECTED UNDER ALL PRIVACY LAWS. HOWEVER IN IT IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED MEDICAL INFORMATION -- THE INFORMATION GENERALLY NEEDS TO BE GENERATED BY A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER INFORMATION THAT IS GENERATED BY A DIGITAL HEALTH FEEDBACK SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE. A MEETING AT THE PATIENT LEVEL AND OUTSIDE OF A MEDICAL FOR US THE SO THE WILL NOT. NECESSARILY BE CAPTURE UNDER THE EXISTING DEFINITION OF MEDICAL INFORMATION. SEVERAL FORMS OF DIGITAL BILLS ARE BEING DEVELOPED WITH A FEW ALREADY IN USE TEACHES THESE THAT EURO DIGITAL BILLS AND PILLOWS EXCUSE ME.

AND ALSO INCORPORATE A LANGUAGE IS BUT SPECIFY FOR END USERS TO ALSO APPLY -- TO OPERATORS. THIS BILL A. B. AB SEVENTEEN OF EIGHTY TO ESTABLISH A BALANCE BETWEEN. A PERSONAL PRIVACY AND PUBLIC SAFETY BY CREATING SPECIFIC PROCEDURES AROUND THE RETENTION AND SHARING OF DATA. THANK YOU. COLLECTED BY AUTOMATED LICENSE PLATE READERS OR A. L. P. R. A. O. P. OURS ARE HIGH SPEED CAMERA SYSTEMS THAT PHOTOGRAPH LICENSE PLATES CONVERTED INTO NUMBERS AND LETTERS INTO MACHINE READABLE TAX. ATTACKED THEM WITH THE TIME AND LOCATION AND THEN UPLOAD THAT DATA INTO A DATABASE FOR RETRIEVAL ALL THIS INFORMATION CAN HAVE IN HOUSE HOW DEPOSIT PUBLIC. SAFETY OUTCOMES WITHOUT PROPER GUIDELINES TO TECHNOLOGY POSES. A THREAT TO THE PRIVACY OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THAT A. L. P. R. IN USERS PROVIDE USAGE AND PRIVACY POLICIES FOR THE THE SECURITY OF ANY DATA THAT IS COLLECTED BOTH IN TERMS OF STORAGE AND ALSO ACCESS. AND THEN DESTROY ANY NON INVESTIGATIVE DATA AND MAKE THEIR OF POLICIES EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC HOWEVER A CURRENT LAW IS SO VAGUE AND DOES NOT PROVIDE THE PUBLIC WITH THE ASSURANCE OF KNOWING THEIR INFORMATION IS SO. INDEED SAVE ALL THIS BILL AT SEVENTEEN EIGHTY TWO WOULD SAFEGUARD THE INFORMATION BY PLACING LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG THE A. L. P. R. DATA IS KEPT AND ALSO HOW IT IS SHARE. MAKING SURE THAT -- AND USES MISTREAT INFORMATION IN THE SAME WAY AS A P. R. OPERATORS WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY AUS FOR YOU I WILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- MR CHOW WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AFTER HERE.

THE MORNING PART GOOD AFTERNOON WITHOUT ONE MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS COREY CELLS -- HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION REGRETTABLY IN OPPOSITION. TO AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY TWO THE EXISTING LAW REQUIRES AN END USER AVAIL PAYER DATA. TO HAVE A POLICY ON THE USAGE OF THOSE DATA AND ALSO TO INCLUDE IN THE POLICY INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT DATA THAT IS RETAINED HOW LONG IT WILL BE HELD. AND IF IT IS TO BE DESTROYED. THIS BILL TAKES THATSEVERAL STEPS FURTHER AND SAYS. THE HE BASICALLY CANNOT HOLD. NON ANONYMIZED ALE PR DATA FOR MORE THAN SIXTY DAYS UNLESS THERE ARE SOME SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES THE THE PROBLEM WE HAVE WITH THE BILL IS THAT. THIS POLICY WHICH IS IN PLACE FOR THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL CREATES A SITUATION WHERE DATA THAT COULD BE USED TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES. OR TO DETERMINE A SUSPECT'S IDENTITY OR TO DETERMINE A SUSPECT'S WHEREABOUTS. ON A PARTICULAR TIME PERIOD. WE'LL BE RENDERED USELESS IF THIS IF THESE DATA CAN ONLY BE KEPT FOR SIXTY DAYS YOU MAY HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THREE MONTHS FOUR YEARS DOWN THE LINE YOU HAVE A CASE. AND YOU NEED TO FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS PARTICULAR PERSON WEATHER IS A SUSPECT OR A VICTIM OR WHOMEVER. MAY HAVE BEEN IN A PARTICULAR LOCATION AND IF THERE IS A HELP YOUR DATA THAT CAN ILLUMINATE THAT SITUATION. THIS BILL WOULD EFFECTIVELY LEAD TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THOSE DATA FAR BEFORE THEY MIGHT BE USEFUL IN A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS WE UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS ABOUT PRIVACY. AND WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S TAKING AMENDMENTS THAT ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES. BUT THE REALITY IS PUTTING A TIME LINE. MEANS THAT AT SOME POINT THESE DATA WILL NO LONGER BE AVAILABLE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO USE FOR THE PURPOSES OF SOLVING CRIMES. AND SO FOR THE RECENT THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES OPPOSITION. MEMBERS THE PUBLIC OPPOSITION. SING ON BRINGING BACK THE MEDI ANY QUESTIONS -- SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS THE CURRENT LAW AND CONTAINS AN EXCEPTION AROUND. KEEPING IT KEEPING THE DATA FOR INVESTIGATIONS I DON'T SEE THAT IN THE CURRENT STATUTES MY CONCERN IS THAT THAT WOULD ONLY APPLY TO THE HIGHWAY PATROL AND OTHER DIVISIONS IS THAT. MY READING CORRECT NO THE INTENT IS -- ADDITIONALLY -- AND APPLY THE SAME LAW TO BOTH SIXTY AND OTHER LIFE WAS MADE UC'S SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS ANY. ARE OVERSIGHT IN THE DRAFTING LANGUAGE THEN WE WANT TO FIX IT BECAUSE THE IDEA IS TO ALL YOU KNOW. WE HAVE A CONSISTENCY BETWEEN LET'S SAY THE H. SIX P. AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. SO OB TO I UNDERSTAND TO SEIZE CAN RETAIN THE INFORMATION FOR LONGER THAN SIXTY DAYS IF THERE ISN'T SOME KIND OF INVESTIGATION GOING ON SO WE WANTED THE SAME -- PROCEDURES IN AND RIGHTS TO BE FORTY TWO OTHER LINES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AS WELL. SO I LIKE I WASN'T MADE AWARE OF THAT PARTICULAR ON SHORT COMING UNTIL TODAY SO WE WILL FIX IT TO MAKE SURE THAT SO IT WILL PROVIDE FOR THAT EXCEPTION FOR INVESTIGATION TO CONTINUE GOING ON TO TO ONE OF THE ISSUES WAS UP YOU KNOW WE WE WERE EXPECTING -- LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE AT THE TABLE BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL RECENTLY THAT YOU FOLKS ARE AT THE TABLE SO WE APPRECIATE THAT THAT YOU'RE HERE. AND WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU BECAUSE WE WE WEREN'T GETTING ANY RESPONSES FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT WHATSOEVER. SO -- IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU KNOW THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD LIKE FIRST TO TWEAK THE A FEW FREE TO DO SO BUT THE INTENT AGAIN TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IS. TO YOU KNOW APPLY THE SAME ALL TO BOTH SIEGE BE AND ALSO ON THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ON I APPRECIATE THE OBVIOUS IT'S IMPORTANT INVESTIGATIONS LAST SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER THAN SIXTY DAYS. SO THEY HAVE AN ELDER CHAIN THAT INFORMATION -- SO MY QUESTION IS AND THIS IS A TECHNICAL QUESTION WHICH YOU MAY OR MAY NOT ANSWER TO IS IT POSSIBLE BECAUSE ONE OF THINGS ALLOWS FOR IS THE RETENTION OF THE DAY TO BE ON THE SIXTY DAYS IF IT'S THE ANONYMOUS. I THINK I THAT RIGHT -- IS IT POSSIBLE TO THEN RETAIN THE DATA IN A D. ANONYMIZED FASHION AND USE IT AT A LATER DATE FOR AN INVESTIGATION BY. ANONYMOUS THING IT YEAH THE DETAILED THE LANGUAGE KILEY SAYS THAT. IF THEY DO NOT ANONYMIZED INFORMATION AND THEY HAVE TO DELETE IT WITHIN SIXTY DAYS RIGHT GIVEN THAT CAMBIADO TO MENTION EARLIER. I'M SO IF THEY WANT TO TRANSFER THE DATA TO ANOTHER AGENCY OR OTHER IN THE TEETH AND THE NEED TO AN ITEMIZED OUT DATA. AND IF THE ANONYMOUS AGAIN AND AGAIN TAKE IT OUT OF THAT IF THEY WERE TO BE IN A SITUATION SUCH AS MISTRESS HAS A LOW DESCRIBES WHERE THEY WANTED TO DO AN INVESTIGATION TO SEE IF OTHER CRIMES HAVE BEEN COMMITTED IN A SIMILAR. WAY THAT'S HOW THE LANGUAGE IS CURRENTLY DRAFTED SO THAT WOULD BE POP TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE. I YES. OKAY. A COUPLE THANK YOU I THINK THAT THAT'S TECHNICALLY OF DO YOU HAVE A RESPONSE I WAS FOR SEVERAL. THROUGH THE CHAIR I I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WOULD BE PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE I MEAN EFFECTIVELY THE DATA THAT ARE CAPPED IS A LICENSE PLATE NUMBER YOU KNOW ABC. ONE TWO THREE AND THEN A LOCATION AT A TIME THERE'S REALLY NO OTHER DATA THAT YOU CAN ATTACH TO IT. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE LPR CIRCUMSTANCE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT RUNNING AGAINST ANY DMV DATABASE SO THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ANY OTHER INFORMATION. SO IN ORDER TO ANONYMIZE IT YOUR AFFECTED LEE I THINK THE HOUSE IS POINTS THIS OUT IN THE FORMER COMMITTEE. YOU HAVE TO SCRAMBLE THE PLATE NUMBER OF THE CHARACTERISTICS I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU. I MEAN I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S PUT INTO LIKE A ROSE IN. A STATE WHERE THE LINES INTO LET'S NOT THE BILL DOESN'T SEEM TO CONTEMPLATE BUT A HOST YOU WOULD DO IT. IN AND AND TO THE POINT ABOUT THE SIXTY DAYS WE WE AGREE THAT WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD BE -- COMPATIBLE WITH EXISTING LAW THAT APPLIES THE SIEGE BE BUT WERE OPPOSED TO THAT STILL. EVEN EVEN THOUGH THE LANGUAGE. THAT. IF THERE'S INVESTIGATION PENDING OR IN CONNECTION WITH A FELONY YOU MAY NOT KNOW THAT SIXTY DAYS SO IT'S HELPFUL TO BE SURE. BUT IT DOESN'T GET OUT THE SITUATION I DESCRIBED WHICH IS THREE YEARS FROM NOW WE DON'T HAVE INVESTIGATION PENDING AND THEN YOU KNOW YOU HAVE AND YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT COMES AND SAYS -- WE HAVE THIS COLD CASE BECAUSE THERE IS NO MORE INVESTIGATION. YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CALL BACK THE DATA BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. SO I MEAN I'M SORRY I'M LOOKING AT MY COLLEAGUES TO MY RATE BECAUSE I BUT HE CAN ANSWER MY QUESTION WHICH I DON'T HAVE THE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE TO BUT I RESPECT THEM TO RESPECT BOTH SIDES MY COMMUNITY USES THESE AND THEY'VE BEEN USED EFFECTIVELY MANY TIMES TO DEAL WITH ROBBERIES. AND I WAS JUST IN PUBLIC SAFETY IS MIND TALKING ABOUT. SEQUENTIAL ROBBERIES -- SO YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE HAVEN'T INCIDENTS WHERE MAYBE THERE IS ONE PRIOR TO SIXTY DAYS SOMEONE AFTER SIX YEARS I SEE THE CONCERN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT -- I WOULD LOVE THE IDEA OF A COMPROMISE WHERE WE COULD. ANONYMIZE IT AND THEN IF NECESSARY LAW ENFORCEMENT COULD CLYDE BACK VERSUS HAVING THIS DATA SITTING OUT THERE AND ESPECIALLY GIVEN I SEE THE BENEFITS ALONG FORCE MAN I AM CONCERNED WITH THE SALE OF THIS DATA RIGHT WHICH WE SEE IN THE REPORT. AND SO CAN WE FIND THE HAPPY MEDIUM BETWEEN PROTECTING OUR PRIVACY AVOIDING THE SALE OF THE STATE ABOUT THE SAME TIME PROTECTING PUBLIC SAFETY. AND I I WOULD. LIKE TO KNOW IF THAT WAS TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE. THANK YOU MISTER. ONE I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA ANSWER THAT I I THINK I MEAN THE IDEA WITH. WITH ANONYMIZING DATA IS THAT IT CANNOT BE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO PUT IT BACK TOGETHER SO IF YOU WERE TO KEEP IT AFTER SIXTY DAYS YOU WOULD ENCRYPTED. AND BUT YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S THE THE BILL PROBABLY DISCUSSION THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE ONGOING BUT YOU YOU -- FIVE MR OBERNOLTE MIGHT HAVE SOME COMMENTS ON THAT BUT I AGREE WITH YOU THE WHOLE POINT OF ANONYMIZING THE DATA. IS SO THAT YOU DISSOCIATE THE IDENTITY WITH THE DATA AND IF THERE WAS A WAY OF PUTTING IT BACK TOGETHER THAT WOULD DEFEAT THE PURPOSE OF HAVING ANONYMIZED AT THE FIRST PLACE. BUT I'M OPEN TO HAVING -- THE DATA BEING AN ENCRYPTED AS WELL I MEAN I'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS WILLING AND ABLE TO DO -- SO I YOU KNOW I'M NOT KIND OF MERRY TO ANY PARTICULAR ON TECHNOLOGY PER SE YEAH SO LONG AS THE INFORMATION IS PROTECTED SO. SO WE WHAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO TO TO DIALOGUE ABOUT THIS I THINK THERE'S THERE'S SO MUCH MORE THAT WE CAN KIND OF WORK WITH -- SO. SO WITH THAT THE I RESPECTFULLY ASK VERY WELL -- MRS YEAH I JUST WANNA SAY I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK THAT WHAT I'M HOPEFUL FOR FROM THIS DISCUSSION IS THAT YOU HAVE AN INTEREST IN PROTECTING PRIVACY FROM THE SALE THAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE ANALYSIS. YOU WOULD LIKE TO USE OUR PUBLIC SAFETY AND THAT YOU TWO CAN GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE FIND THE HAPPY MEDIUM AND WITHOUT ALL SUPPORTED AND I WITH ALL MY VOTE ON THE FLOOR UNLESS WE FIND A GOOD COMPROMISE THANK YOU THE SMITH. I I SHARE MY COLLEAGUES -- CONCERNS I I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO GET WHAT THEY NEED -- WITH REGARDS TO WHAT CAN BE REALLY IMPORTANT EVIDENCE FOR THEM TO WORK WITH SO I WILL MOVE TO TO GET ABOUT BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY BUT HOLD RESERVATIONS MAKE SURE LAW ENFORCEMENT IS IS A NON OPPOSE WHEN WE GET TO FLOOR. WE SHOULD. THE OTHER QUESTIONS THE GUY WAS GONNA SAME COMMENT THAT -- MOBILE -- SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO WORK WITH -- LAW ENFORCEMENT AS MY TWO OTHER COLLEAGUES STATED.

IT WAS INTENDED TO RAISE THE IMPORTS OF CYBER SECURITY TO THE NEW GOVERNOR AND GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE CHANGES AFTER DISCUSSIONS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. THERE IS INTERESTED IN HAVING THE CURRENT CONFIGURATION CONTINUE FOR THE TIME BEING AND I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT STRIKING OUT THE NEW OFFICES. PROVISIONS HOWEVER THERE WAS ANOTHER COMPONENT OF AB TWELVE FORTY TWO AND THAT IS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY OF STATE AGENCIES WHO DO NOT RIP -- DIRECTLY REPORT TO THE GOVERNOR AND AS YOU REMEMBER WE HAD THIS BILL LAST YEAR ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAO AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE WERE -- CO AUTHORS AND WE WOULD LIKE -- TO WORK ON THAT ISSUE AGAIN WHICH SOUGHT -- TO HAVE SIMILAR ACCOUNTABILITY AND UNIFORMITY AND CYBER SECURITY COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OUR STATE OFFICIALS AS THIS BILL IS NARROWED IN THIS COMMITTEE AN NGO I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORKING TO TRY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH INDEPENDENT CONSTITUTIONAL.

GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RUNNING COULD GEORGE AND I AM A LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE WITH THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE YOUR PURSE ERA. ON BEHALF OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE I'M HERE TODAY TO EXPRESS CONCERNS WITH AB TWELVE FORTY TWO WE'VE EXPRESSED HIS CONCERNS WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- WINS OFFICE AND HOPE THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO RESOLVE THEM. WELL WE SUPPORT THE GOAL OF IMPROVING IN STANDARDIZING INFORMATION SECURITY ACROSS STATE GOVERNMENT. I WANT TO BE SURE THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY UNDERSTAND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S CONCERNS. AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN THIS BILL WOULD HAVE SERIOUS RAMIFICATIONS FOR DOJ AND THE CONFIDENTIAL DATA BELONGING TO PRIVATE CALIFORNIA CITIZENS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TENS OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS RECORDS OF CRIMINAL HISTORY PATIENT MEDICAL HISTORY. AS WELL AS HIGHLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION ON DOJ'S CONFIDENTIAL INVESTIGATIONS LITIGATION. IN ORDERTO SAFEGUARD THIS HIGHLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION DOJ'S INFORMATION SECURITY STANDARDS AND PRACTICES ALREADY MISSED IT HERE TO SPECIALIZE IN STRINGENT SECURITY MEASURES. REQUIRED NOT ONLY BY THE STATE A BY THE FBI STANDARDS AS WELL. THIS BILL PLACES DOJ'S PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES AT RISK AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT DATA OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS AT RISK AT WHILE. WE HAVE MET WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE IMPOSED QUESTIONS HAVE NOT YET BEEN ANSWERED SOME OF THE QUESTIONS ARE. IN ORDER TO ADD HERE TO SPECIALIZE IN CERTAIN STRINGENT SECURITY MEASURES AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT ALL DOD EMPLOYEES THAT HAVE ACCESS TO SECURITY RELATED DATA MUST FIRST UNDERGO FULL PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION AND PERSONAL SCREENING. HOW WILL CITY TN OC EMPLOYEES MEET THAT STANDARD? HOW WILL DOJ CONTINUE TO REMAIN IMPARTIAL INVESTIGATORY PROSECUTORIAL MATTERS IF DOJ NO LONGER HAS A TANAMI AND SEPARATION FROM OTHER STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND OFFICERS? DOJ ALREADY UNDERGOES F. B. I. AUDITS EVERY THREE YEARS AS WELL AS MANY OTHER INTERNAL AN INDEPENDENT AUDIT. WHAT IS THE VALUE ADDED TO CALIFORNIA CITIZENS BY AT LEAST THREE OTHER AUDITS? UNDER AB TWELVE FORTY TWO C. T. O. R. O. C. WILL HAVE THE DISCRETION OF CREATING ISSUING MAINTAINING POLICIES AND STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES. DIRECTING STATE AGENCIES TO MANAGE SECURITY AND RISK THIS PRETTY MUCH INCLUDES ALL TECHSYSTEMS AN INFRASTRUCTURE. HOW WILL CETINA SEE BE ABLE TO FORCE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE ARE SORRY RATHER WILL CITY T. N. O. C. BE ABLE TO FORCE HOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND ELECTED CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICER PRIORITIZES ITS OPERATIONS? BASED ON CD TEEN -- SEE REQUIREMENTS AND PREFERENCES. UNDER AB -- TWELVE FORTY TWO SEE WOULD BE LEADING HIM REPRESENTING DOJ AN INFORMATION SECURITY AND DATA SHARING MATTERS PERTAINING TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA INCLUDING BEFORE THE FBI AND OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES. HOW WILL CITY TN OC REPRESENT THE STATE ON THESE FEDERAL ADVISORY GROUPS WHEN THEY ARE NOT A CRIMINAL AGENCY AS REQUIRED BY THE FBI? FINALLY COULD CDT DIRECT TO DOJ SECURITY TECHNOLOGY TOOLS AND PROCUREMENT DECISIONS AND REQUIRED DOJ TO USE CITY TO TECHNOLOGY AND DISALLOW DOJ'S CURRENT TECHNOLOGY DUE TO CO TWO CD TEASE PREFERENCE. I WOULD URGE THE COMMITTEE TODAY TO CONSIDER AND ASK THE SAME QUESTIONS. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ECHO THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUES IN THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE AND THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANKS VERY MUCH NEXT WHEN HIS PLACE. MY NAME IS STEPHANIE MARK I SERVICE DEPUTY SECRETARY STATE FOR SECRETARY ALEX PADILLA WE HAVE NO FORMAL POSITION ON THE BILL WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK AS WELL AS COMMITTEE STAFF ON THEIR ANALYSIS. WE LOOK FOR WE ABSOLUTELY. SUPPORT THE INTENT OF THE BILL THERE'S NO DOUBT IN OUR MIND THAT WE CAN ALWAYS DO MORE AND MUST KEEP. CYBERSECURITY AT THE FOREFRONT OF OUR MIND THE METHOD OF WHICH THIS BILL PROCEEDS -- TO REACH THAT GOAL HOWEVER IS NOT ONE THAT WE FIND PRAGMATIC OR INCREASING OF OUR CYBERSECURITY SO WE DEFINITELY. WORK WILL CONTINUE TO DISCUSS AND WORK WITH THE AUTHOR -- TO FURTHER THE GOAL AND LOOK FOR PATHWAYS SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE A SAFER STATE BUT AT THIS TIME WE WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE CALL AND WE WANT TO HELP. REACH IT IN A WAY THAT WORKS AND DOESN'T -- MAKE US LESS SECURE BECAUSE THAT'S NO ONE SCHOOL. THANKS VERY MUCH -- ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. SEEING AND HEARING NINE LET'S BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS -- LET ME START OFF BY -- IF IT'S ALL THINKING THE THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. I DO RESPECT THE POSITION REYES BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS AND AND AND I DO UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT -- HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN RAISED IN AN I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO CYBERSECURITY WE CAN NO LONGER WORK IN SILOS I THINK WE WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN. TO REALLY OF POOL OUR RESOURCES TOGETHER BECAUSE IT YOU KNOW IT IF WE CONTINUE GOING DOWN YOU KNOW DIFFERENT SILOS AND YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE WASTING A LOT OF RESOURCES BE GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE YOU KNOW WE HAVE ONE MORE. ONE THING IN MIND AND THAT IS TO YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW DO THE BEST PROVIDE THE BEST CYBERSECURITY THAT WE CAN FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I DO ARE. WANT TO ENCOURAGE A BOTH OF YOU DID TO CONTINUE WORKING BECAUSE I KERRY IS VERY SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR. AND YOU KNOW THE INTENT -- OBVIOUSLY -- YOU KNOW -- MEASURE WHEN YOU CAN ALSO CHIME IN LATER BUT THE INTENT WHEN I CARRIED OUT BILL WAS JUST THAT I THINK YOU KNOW WE WANT TO BASICALLY -- WORK TOGETHER YOU KNOW INSTEAD OF A WORKING IN SILOS AND AND AND THERE ARE SO MANY REASONS THAT WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER WHEN IT COMES TO CYBER -- THAT SAVES FOUGHT ONE OF OUR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS BEING ATTACKED FOR EXAMPLE I THINK WE ALL NEED YOU KNOW TO NOTIFY OF OTHER OTHER IMPORTANT PLAYERS IN IN IN THE EQUATION. SO SO THAT'S MY FUNDAMENTAL POSITION AND I THINK TO THE EXTENT WE CAN CONTINUE TO TO YOU KNOW SORT OUT ANY ANY ANY PARTICULAR ISSUES. ARM -- I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO SO -- SO WITHOUT AYE ONE OPEN A FOR ON QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEING AND HEARING. NINE SEVEN ZERO AND FEEL FREE -- TO CLOSE OR ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT'S BEEN REYES IF YOU SO DESIRE AND YES SURE IT CERTAINLY AND AND AS AS YOU MENTIONED WITH THIS BILL WENT THROUGH LAST YEAR CERTAINLY -- MIGHT I WE ARE VERY WELL AWARE OF ALL THE SENSITIVE INFORMATION THAT THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS HOLDS IT I HAVE BEEN CONCERNED WITH CYBERSECURITY FROM THE DAY THAT I HAVE GOTTEN HERE WE WOULD. NEVER DO ANYTHING THAT WOULD PUT -- ANY OF THE DEPARTMENTS IN A WORSE POSITION WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT. IN OUR ROLE OF OVERSIGHT THAT EVERY DEPARTMENT IS DOING -- WHAT THEY NEED TO PROTECTED THE INFORMATION OF THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE A -- STATED TO ALL THE CONSTITUTIONAL THAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH -- AND FIND SOME WAY THAT IS ACCEPTABLE TO THEM I I THINK WE ALL HAVE THE SAME GOAL -- AS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHILD SAID WE DON'T WANT TO WORK IN SILENCE TO IT WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SOME CONSISTENCY ACROSS EVERY STATE DEPARTMENT OF WHETHER TIME OUT SECRETARY OF STATE AND PROTECTING OUR ELECTIONS. OR DLJ WE ARE WE ARE ABSOLUTELY ONLY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS THAT WE ARE IN A BETTER POSITION THAN WE ARE TODAY SO -- WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH YOU THAT'S COMPLETELY OUR INTENTION AND IF THE CURRENT SUGGESTIONS ABOUT REPORTING TO CD T. WERE ARE ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE WE THINK THAT THERE IS A LOT OF OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN -- FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAYBE REPORT TO THIS COMMITTEE OR REPORTS SOME PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT THAT THESE AUDITS AND ASSESSMENTS ARE BEING DONE AND THAT ALL OUR DEPARTMENTS ARE APPROPRIATELY PROTECTED. AND WITH THAT I ASKED HER ABOUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DO I HAVE A MOTION FOR THIS BILL. OH OKAY MOVED AND SECONDED.

CHAU HI CHAO HIGH KILEY BARRICADE HERE. BAUER-KAHAN I BERMAN. BERMAN I CALDERON. CALDERON HI GABRIEL. GALLAGHER. IRWIN. HI IRWIN HI OBERNOLTE. OBERNOLTE AYE SMITH. SMITH HI WICKS. SEVEN YOUR BILL HAS SEVEN NOTES -- IT IS OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT BRINGS US TO MISTER TING WELCOME MR TING YOU HAVE AB YOU. ONE SIXTY ONE GOOD AFTERNOON UP HONOR TO PRESENT AB -- ONE SIXTY ONE ARE SKIP TO SLIP BILL I JUST WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF. YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR WORKING OUT AMENDMENTS WITH US -- JUSTER WE STAY WITH THE AMENDMENTS ARE -- IS SAYS AS AMENDED AB ONE SIX ONE WHAT STARTING ON JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TO ALLOW CONSUMERS. TO OPT OUT OF RECEIVING A RECEIPT AND THEN STARTING ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ALLOW CONSUMERS TO CHOOSE BETWEEN NO RECEIPT. AND THE RECEIPT OR A PAPER RECEIPT -- THE AMENDMENTS ADDITIONALLY PROTECT CONSUMER PRIVACY BY ENSURING THAT PERSONAL INFORMATION USED TO PROVIDE THIS RECEIPT. SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR MARKETING PURPOSES -- AGAIN -- THE RECEIPTS ARE LACED ARE THESE PEOPLE RECEIPTS AGAIN REALLY SHOULD BE AN OPTION WE MODELED THIS OUR RECEIPT BILL AFTER -- MY COLLEAGUES -- STRAW BILL LAST YEAR TO REALLY ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WOULD ASK FOR RECEIPTS RATHER THAN -- ALWAYS GET RECEIPTS. DURING THIS PROCESS OF WORKING ON THIS BILL WE FOUND AT THE RECEIPT PAPER IS ACTUALLY LACED WITH EITHER BPA OR BE PS WHICH IS ACTUALLY A TOXIC SUBSTANCE. IN ADDITION THE RECEIPT PAPER IS VERY DIFFICULT TO RECYCLE BECAUSE OF ITS VERY SMALL SIZE AND BECAUSE OF THE TOXICITY THEY CANNOT BE COMPOSTED THE SO IF THEY ARE GOING IN THE COMPOST ACTUALLY WILL RUIN A COMPOST. ON IN ADDITION THERE'S AN ESTIMATE OF THREE MILLION TREES AND NINE BILLION GALLONS OF WATER EVERY YEAR BEING USED. TO CREATE THE PAPER RECEIPTS SO AGAIN WE THINK THAT WE CAN UTILIZE THESE RESOURCES MUCH BETTER REDUCE WASTE AND ALSO -- MAKE IT BACK TO THE CONSUMER SO THAT IF THEY REALLY WANT THE PAPER SEATS THEY CAN ASK FOR THE WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB. ONE SIXTY ONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF FIRST WHEN HIS PLACE. I GET AFTERNOON THE CAUCUS WITH THE ENVIRONMENT ORGANIZATION CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. THIS BILL REALLY TARGET PROBABLY THE LOWEST HANGING FRUIT THAT EXISTS IN TERMS OF WASTE REDUCTION. AND THAT'S ITEM THAT THE CONSUMER SAYS THEY DO NOT WANT. AND THAT THEY BASICALLY HOLD ONTO UNTIL THEY GET TO NEXT TRASH CAN AND THROW AWAY -- SO NOT ONLY DO WE NOT REALLY NEED RECEIPTS WITH OUR MORNING COFFEE OR BAGEL -- THOSE RECEIPTS ESPECIALLY THE THIRD ONLY PRINT ONES BECOME CONTAMINATION IN OUR RECYCLING STREAM THEY ALSO CONTAMINATE COMPOST. AGAIN THE THE BILL ONLY SAYS THAT CONSUMERS WHO WANT RECEIPTS GET THEM. SO THAT SHOULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED AMOUNT OF CONTAMINATION AND CREATE AN IMPROVE OUR QUALITY OF RECYCLABLES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS READ AT US ON BEHALF OF THE BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT. IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE OF OUR NATIONAL ORGANIZATION WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON PREVENTING BREAST CANCER THERE BY -- WHAT WE FOCUS ON IS REDUCING EXPOSURE TO CHEMICALS AND RADIATION THEIR LINK TO THE DISEASE? THIS MEASURE ACTUALLY HELPS TO REDUCE THAT EXPOSURE AS IT WAS MENTIONED. THE P. A. B. P. S. ARE BOTH -- ELEMENTS OF THESE THERMAL RECEIPTS -- THERE ARE NUMEROUS REPORTS AND STUDIES I HAVE ONE RIGHT HERE THAT SHOW THAT -- WHEN WE'RE TALKING AND DEALING IN STUDYING WITH PEOPLE WHO INTERACT WITH THESE RECEIPTS THEY'RE ACTUALLY GETTING THEM IN THEIR BLOODSTREAM? THE P. P. A. B. PS IN PARTICULAR ARE PROBLEMATIC WHEN YOU LOOK AT A TWENTY EIGHTEEN ECOLOGY CENTER STUDY OF RECEIPTS FROM TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED EIGHT MAJOR GROCERS BIG STORE BOX. IN RETAILERS GAS STATIONS THEATERS LIBRARIES SMALL INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES THEY FOUND BE PS IN PPA IN 93% OF THE RECEIPTS THEY TESTED. THESE CHEMICALS ARE ABSORBED THROUGH THE SKIN OF CONSUMERS AND CASHIERS WHEN HANDLING THE RECEIPTS. THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR CONSUMERS AND WORKERS ALIKE OVER TWO HUNDRED INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC STUDIES DOCUMENT. THE VERY LOW DOSES OF PPA IS LINKED TO STAGGERING NUMBERS OF HEALTH PROBLEMS INCLUDING BREAST AND PROSTATE CANCER MALE AND FEMALE INFERTILITY SO ON AND SO FORTH. THE SAME FOR B. PS IS IT THEREFORE WE'RE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT THE MEASURE I BECAUSE IT OF ITS -- ASSISTANCE IN REDUCING EXPOSURE TO THESE HARMFUL CHEMICALS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL SUPPORTERS SO PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELVES ALEX AND ANI'S ON BEHALF OF THE DIGITAL RECEIPT COALITION WHICH INCLUDE THE COMPANIES OF THàNH CASH AND RECEIPT ME. IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU MUCH NEXT PLEASE. RICHARD OLIVER CONSUMER FEDERATION CALIFORNIA WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO SOON BEING AT A POSITION OF SUPPORT WE'VE HAD SOME VERY GOOD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR. OF A REGARDING SONG BEVERLY CREDIT CARD -- PRIVACY ACT AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL SOON BE IN A POSITION OF ACHIEVING THE GREAT GOALS OF THIS BILL WHICH ARE AROUND TOXIC REDUCTION AND ENERGY CONSERVATION AND WASTE REDUCTION AND AT THE SAME TIME. OF PROTECTING -- CONSUMER PRIVACY WHEN THEY USE A CREDIT CARD FOR TRANSACTION THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT PLEASE. CAN THE ROBINSON ON BEHALF OF RETHINK WASTE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. GENEVIEVE AVEDON ON BEHALF OF THE CLEAN SEIZE LOVING COALITION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU -- OPPOSITION PLACE -- COME ON UP. IF I COULD TO ASK THAT WE CLEAR SOME ROOM FOR THE OPPOSITION ANY TWO INDIVIDUALS ARE COMING UP WELCOME. FIFTY TO PROCEED. TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME'S MATT SATIN ON WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION. WE'RE NOT HERE TO DEFEND RECEIPTS BUT WE ARE HERE TO OBJECT TO A MANDATE FOR CERTAIN TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY -- TO BE PUT IN THE FOUR WALLS OF A RESTAURANT AND THAT'S THE WAY WE READ THE BILL THE BILL DOES REQUIRE THAT WE MOVED TO AN ELECTRONIC RECEIPT PLATFORM AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND EVEN WITH THE AMENDMENTS. AND SO WE ARE FORCED TO MAINTAIN THE TRADITIONAL PAPER RECEIPT SYSTEM WHICH IS NOT AN ISSUE -- BUT ALSO WE MUST HAVE THE ELECTRONIC RECEIPT TECHNOLOGY AND THAT PATHWAY -- UNDER THE BILL AND SO THAT IS A MANDATE FOR A CERTAIN TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY WITHIN RESTAURANTS MANY RESTAURANTS ARE NOT THERE YET IT IS TRUE THAT THERE ARE RETAIL AND RESTAURANT ESTABLISHMENTS -- THEY DO HAVE -- ELECTRONIC RECEIPT CAPABILITIES BUT IT'S INCREDIBLY COSTLY IT'S COSTLY FOR RESTAURANTS -- AND SO WE LIKE I SAID REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN BOTH AVENUES SO THAT IS A POINT OF OBJECTION -- AND THEN THERE IS THE ISSUE WITH RESTAURANTS WHETHER THEY'RE IN A FRANCHISE MODEL MANY OF THE FRANCHISE CONTRACTS WITH THE FRANCHISEE. THEY DO STIPULATE THAT THESE TYPES OF COSTS HAVE TO BE BORN AND ACCEPTED IN ABSORBED BY THE ACTUAL INDIVIDUAL FRANCHISEES SO THE IDEA THAT THIS IS JUST ON BIG BUSINESS -- IT COULD NOT BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH WHEN IT COMES TO RESTAURANTS AND THEN THE OTHER THING I WANT TO POINT OUT TO YOU -- WHICH WAS INFORMATION TO ME WHICH IS MANY RESTAURANTS ACTUALLY ARE LEASING THE EQUIPMENT THEY'RE LEASING THE POINT OF SALE SYSTEM SO THEY'RE LOCKED INTO A CONTRACT. FOR THAT PERIOD OF TIME -- AND THAT WILL BE IN PLACE WHEN THIS BILL COMES IN WITH THE MANDATE -- TO GO TO ANOTHER TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY SO FOR US IT IT REALLY IS BOILING DOWN TO REQUIRING US TO HAVE THAT TECHNOLOGY IT'S INCREDIBLY COSTLY FOR RESTAURANTS -- I AGREE THAT OVER TIME THEY'RE GOING TO GET THERE BUT MOVING THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE IS JUST MOVING THE DATE AT WHICH WE ARE FORCED TO TAKE THAT -- TECHNOLOGY I KNOW THERE ARE SOME EXEMPTIONS -- WITH REGARD TO THE MILLION DOLLARS IN GROSS RECEIPTS OR LESS -- BUT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT'S A SMALL ENTITY OR SMALL RESTAURANT YOU CAN HAVE A SMALL RESTAURANT THAT HAS HIGH SALES VOLUME -- IN EASILY HIT THAT MARK SO THAT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR OUR SMALL RESTAURANTS -- AND THEN OF COURSE THE ENFORCEMENT PIECE IS VERY CONCERNING -- IT YOU KNOW IT'S CERTAINLY. ALLOWS FOR LOCAL ENFORCEMENT -- DISTRICT ATTORNEYS -- AND CITY ATTORNEYS AND THAT IS OF CONCERN TO US BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS TO BECOME SORT OF A A NEW DRIVE BY LAWSUIT TYPE OF ISSUE -- THAT WE FACED A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS -- I'VE GOT LOTS OF OTHER THINGS BUT OF THE INTEREST OF TIME ALL LEAVE IT THERE MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS.

THE TECHNOLOGY REQUIRED JUST TO BE ABLE TO OFFER THAT ELECTRONIC RECEIPTS OTHERS COSTS AS WE MENTIONED -- AND THEN ALSO THE FEAR OF LITIGATION LITIGATIONS OF COURSE EXPENSIVE FOR ANY BUSINESS BUT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES CAN BE CRIPPLING AND UNDER OF COURSE IN ADDITION ALL THE CCPA QUESTIONS AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING THROUGH. SOME OF THESE WITH THE AUTHOR -- A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS ARE VERY VERY ANXIOUS AND CONCERNED ABOUT THE IDEA OF COLLECTING EMAIL ADDRESSES. EMAILING RECEIPTS HAVING TO STORE THAT DATA AND IF THAT DATA WAS COMPROMISE IS THE LITIGATION TRIES A HUGE CONCERN AS WELL AND THE QUESTION OF LIABILITY SO FOR THOSE REASONS AND MANY OTHERS.

MAYBE WHAT I'LL DO IS TO ASK THE AUTHOR THEIR ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES AS WE HEARD QUITE A FEW TODAY. BUT BEFORE I DO THAT -- ARE YOU ACCEPTING ALL THE AMENDMENTS YES I AND WE ALSO COMMITTEE WORKING ON DISABILITY EXEMPTION WOULD -- TO FOLKS YES WE BUT WE BELIEVE -- WE KNOW WE COULDN'T -- GET IN TIME FOR THIS COMMITTEE BUT WE DO WE DO BELIEVE WE HAVE LANGUAGE THAT WILL -- TAKE CARE OF THE SOME INFORMATION SO IF YEAH MISTER CALDERON GO AHEAD I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MISTER TING AND I AND I APPRECIATE YOU USING -- STRAWS BONTA QUESTIONS MODEL FOR YOUR FOR YOUR BILL AND I AND I REALLY WOULD PUT CAUTION EVERYBODY -- LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE AS IF IT'S AN A ON IMPORTANT ISSUE AND SOMETHING TO KIND OF BRUSHED ASIDE AND NOT TAKE SERIOUSLY -- BECAUSE EVERYBODY DID THAT WAS DRAWS UPON REQUEST AND I THINK WE CAN ALL SEE HOW HOW SERIOUSLY THE WORLD'S TAKEN THAT ISSUE NOW -- YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO THIS SPECIFIC AND PARTICULAR ISSUE YOU'RE NOT. I YEAH. I KNOW EVERY TIME THAT I AM GIVEN A RECEIPT AT SOMETHING THAT I DON'T USUALLY WANT -- SOMETHING THAT I USUALLY TEND TO DISCARD PRETTY QUICKLY -- YOU KNOW I I UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE IN TERMS OF POINT OF SALE BEING ABLE TO PROVE PROOF OF PURCHASE -- AND I THINK THAT THAT THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE A REAL LEGITIMATE CONCERN ADDRESS WITHIN THIS BILL IS HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU VERIFY THAT SOMEBODY. IF I DECIDE I DON'T NEED THIS -- I DON'T WANT TO RECEIVE NOT A ONE ELECTRONIC VERSION I'M OPTING OUT OF EVEN TO GET GETTING A RECEIPT HOW DO YOU PROVE THAT I I I BOUGHT THE PRODUCT THAT I BUT THEN I BOUGHT BUT THAT IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH A PROOF OF PURCHASE WITHOUT. THE THAT WITHOUT THE RECEIPT I GO TO HOME DEPOT ALL THE TIME MY WIFE AND I WOULD LOVE TO DO A LOT OF WORK. ON OUR ON OUR HOUSE AND I NEVER TAKE THE RECEIPT -- OR I ALWAYS GET A RECEIPT BUT I NEVER TAKE IT BACK WHEN THEY NEED TO RETURN SOMETHING BECAUSE I USUALLY JUST USE MY CREDIT CARD THAT I USE TO PURCHASE THE ITEM TO TO VERIFY -- THAT I DID BUY THE ITEM THERE AND AND AND THEY CAN LOOK THAT UP JUST THROUGH RUNNING THE CREDIT CARD THAT I USE THAT THE AT THE POINT OF PURCHASE -- YOU KNOW I I KNOW THAT. MADE IN MY THAT THERE COULD BE OTHERS BUT IN TERMS OF GROCERY STORES COSCO IS THE ONLY ONE THAT I CAN REALLY THINK OF OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD THAT REALLY USES A RECEIPT -- TO VERIFY BEFORE EVERYBODY LEAVES THAT YOU KNOW YOU REALLY DID PURCHASE THE IN FOR A YEAR REALLY DID PURCHASE THE PRODUCTS THAT. YOU'RE TRYING TO LEAVE THE STORE WITH AND SO -- YOU KNOW THAT NEED TO BE A CONCERN THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESS ALTHOUGH I ALSO DON'T FEEL LIKE IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN FIGURE OUT -- BUT% BUT BEING ABLE TO VERIFY. EVEN WITH AN ELECTRONIC RECEIPT -- BEING ABLE TO VERIFY PROOF OF PURCHASE IS IMPORTANT -- AND THEN YOU KNOW. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS INTERESTING THAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION WAS THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE BE PA'S THAT ARE BEING USED. OUR OR OR THAT ARE THAT ARE EXISTING ON THE THE RECEIPTS -- I MEAN IF THAT'S THE CASE ON THE NECESSARY SHOULD ALREADY AREN'T LEGAL IN A PROP SIXTY FIVE SO. IT BE INTERESTING TO TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THERE REALLY IS B. P. A.'S. ARE THAT ARE THAT ARE PRESENT THERE BECAUSE THOSE ARE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS IT BOB SOMETHING THAT WE'VE RECOGNIZING WE'VE DEALT WITH QUITE A LONG TIME AGO AND SO IT WOULD BE GOOD NOW -- IF THAT REALLY ACTUALLY TRULY IS THE CASE -- AND AND IF THERE IS A PROJECTS AFFECTED OR NOT -- SO. YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WE NEED TO ADDRESS -- YOU KNOW WE'RE VERY RACE -- OF WASTEFUL. SPECIES AND IT'S USUALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CONVENIENCE AND OTHER STUFF LIKE THAT -- IN IT AND IT'S NOT SMART FOR US TO CONTINUE JUST OVERLOOK SMALL THINGS LIKE THIS THE THIS IS A CONVENIENCE FOR US -- THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ESTABLISH BUT WE ALSO ARE LIVING IN THE MOST TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED TIME OF OUR LIVES. SO THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO MOVE FORWARD I I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS SPECIFYING THAT -- YOU KNOW. TO MAKE RECEIVED OPTIONAL BEEN TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND REQUIRED BUSINESSES TO OFFER PAPER OR YOU RECEIPTS BEGINNING IN. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THE HELP AND I THINK THAT IN MY OPINION THAT'S WOULD HELP MITIGATE THE COST. OF ANY POTENTIAL TURN OVER THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE WHEN IT COMES OF THE SYSTEM THAT YOU'RE USING TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT A NEW SYSTEM. OF PROVIDING ANY RECEIPT -- AND THAT'S GENERALLY WHAT THE LEGISLATURE TENDS TO DO IS INFLAMMATION. IT TOOK TO REDUCE THE COST IS IS IS IS DROUGHT THE IMPLEMENTATION TIME OR THE REQUIREMENT. OF WHEN YOU HAVE TO WHEN YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW -- THIS SPECIFIC REGULATION SO I I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM NOT DOABLE FOR THE BUSINESS THAT ARE AFFECTED I THINK THIS IS JUST. SOMETHING NEW AND IT'S A CHANGE IN EVERYBODY'S RESISTANT TO CHANGE ESPECIALLY BUSINESS WHEN SOMETHING'S BEEN WORKING AND I UNDERSTAND THAT SENTIMENT I UNDERSTAND THE SENTIMENT OF BEING CONCERNED OUT OF COST BUT I THINK THAT -- YOU'VE DONE THAT BY PUSHING OUT THE THE TIME FRAME I AND I JUST ASK THAT YOU CONTINUE TO KINDA MITIGATE SOME OF THE ISSUES OF PROOF PROOF OF PURCHASE SYSTEM MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT PUTTING BUSINESSES IN ANY POSITION WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HIRE SOMEBODY TO STAND. AT THE DOOR -- TO PROVE THAT THEY BOUGHT SOMETHING -- BY SHOWING ME YOUR PHONE OR SOMETHING ELSE LIKE THAT I MEAN THERE COULD BE OTHER POTENTIAL ISSUES THAT ARISE IF YOU HAVE AN ANSWER BUT HERE BUT IF NOT. THAT THE THOUGH THAT THAT WOULD BE MY CONCERN BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS WHERE THE ISSUE AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT -- AGAIN CALIFORNIA'S GOING TO BE A LEADER ON NO MATTER HOW RIDICULOUS PEOPLE MAY THINK IT IS NOW IT IS ACTUALLY NOT A RIDICULOUS THIS YOU TO REDUCE. ALL OF OUR IMPACTS ON THIS PLANET BY REDUCING OUR OUR WAYS SO THANK YOU. THEY WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT THE OR I'M HAPPY TO RESPONSIBLE WANT TO DO IT I CAN HELP YOU TO RESPOND AS WELL AS TO THE OPPOSITION. TO OUR MISSED BAUER-KAHAN AND THEN FOLLOWED BY MISS SMITH AND AND YOU CAN. SO. THANK YOU I'M FOR BRINGING THIS APP I'VE FEET I LOVE PHASE ONE I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I WALK INTO A STORE AND I DON'T WANT TO RECEIPTS AND THEY PRINTED AND HAND IT TO ME AND THAT FEELS LIKE TRUE WASTE AND I WISH THEY WOULD JUST. SAY TO ME. DO YOU WANT THE RECEIPT BEFORE THEY PRINT IT SAID PHASE ONE FEELS LIKE ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT POLICY CALL AND AS A MOTHER I ACTUALLY NEVER LET MY KIDS HANDLE RECEIPTS BECAUSE I KNEW ABOUT B. P. A. B. PS AND ESPECIALLY ON THE ONLY. ONE IN CHILDREN I KNOW WELL MY BACKGROUND -- BUT ESPECIALLY IN CHILDREN THAT REALLY HAS AN IMPACT GIVEN THE SIZE OF THEIR BODIES AND SO THIS IS. AN ISSUE THAT I THINK WE SHOULD BE TAKING SERIOUSLY BOTH FROM ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO THE TOXICITY OF THE RECEIPTS IS REAL -- BUT I AM CONCERNED WITH THE IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESSES AND YOU AND I HAVE HAD THIS CONVERSATION -- AND I'M CONCERNED WHEN I THINK ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS IS A THRESHOLD YOU KNOW I DO AGREE THAT I THINK THEY'RE PROBABLY LOCAL RESTAURANTS THAT ARE PRICEY IN THE BAY AREA THAT REACH A MILLION DOLLARS. A MOM AND POP RESTAURANT A LOCAL JEWELRY STORE YOU KNOW YOU CAN THINK OF A LOT OF EXAMPLES. AND SO I DON'T WANT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS TO BE SO COSTLY THAT WERE HURTING OUR LOCAL BUSINESSES AND SO I WOULD ACTUALLY INVITE THE OPPOSITION AS WELL -- YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT IS THIS MOVES FORWARD IT THE DEFINITION OF THAT IS CLARIFIED SO THAT ARE SMALL BUSINESSES WERE REALLY THE FOR THE FOLKS CONCERNED IN MY DISTRICT ARE DRESSED. AND SO I WOULD INVITE YOU -- SIR IF YOU HAVE THOUGHTS ON WHAT A BETTER DEFINITION ART PROP FOR THEM. YOUR THOUGHTS YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE YEAH WE WE IS ALSO AGREE WITH -- THE RESTAURANTS CESSATION AS WELL THE MILLION DOLLARS A HARD TARGETS WE'D LIKE TO DEFINITELY FOLLOW UP. WITH SOME DIFFERENT MEASURES BECAUSE IT'S IT'S IT'S HARD TO DO IN A IN A IN A NUMBER BUT YEAH IT WOULD BE LIKE FOLLOW UP AND I AM. DO WE HAVE YOUR COMMITMENT TO LIVE TOGETHER. TO ATTENTION -- WERE COMPLETELY OPEN TO WHAT THE DEFINITION IS WHAT SAN FRANCISCO USERS. WE ARE ACTUALLY VERY OPEN TO A BETTER DEFINITION. WE ALSO DO WANT TO MENTION WE EXEMPTED OUT BUSINESSES THAT ONLY TAKE CASH SO IF YOU ONLY TAKE CASH YOUR EXEMPTED ON THE BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU. I MISS SMITH HAD. I AM I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THE INTENT BEHIND THIS BILL I I THINK YOU KNOW ENVIRONMENTALLY IT MAKES SENSE ON TO BE REDUCING WASTE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. I HAVE TWO CONCERNS PRIMARILY ONE I THINK THAT THERE REGULATION OR THE THE DANGER OF THIS SMALL CHEMICALS IS THIS SHOULD BE A SEPARATE. ISSUE AND AND HANDLE REGULAR REGULATORY LEE SEPARATELY. BUT ONE THING THAT I JUST I CANNOT GET AWAY FROM -- FROM MY CAMPAIGN AND AND NOW TO MY SERVICE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE'S HEARING TIME AND TIME AGAIN FOR BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES NOT JUST SMALL BUSINESSES BUT ANYBODY EVEN A MIDSIZE BUSINESS EVEN SOMEBODY WITH GROSS RECEIPTS OVER A MILLION DOLLARS. THAT THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA IS GETTING TOO HIGH AND NOT UNLIKE A LOT OF WELL INTENTIONED TAX MEASURES THAT ARE COMING OUT OF OUR OUR ASSEMBLY THIS YEAR. THIS INCREMENTAL APPROACH IN PUSHING THESE COSTS ON TO BUSINESS IS BECOMING. PROHIBITIVE I MEAN I APPRECIATE THAT IT'S EVEN A COUPLE OF YEARS OUT BUT THE FACT THAT IT'S A COUPLE OF YEARS OUT MEANS THAT'S A FEW MORE YEARS OF COMPLIANCE WITH INCREASING MINIMUM WAGE REQUIREMENTS. THAT'S INCREASE IN WORKERS COMP PREMIUMS IT'S INCREASE IT FROM PLAYERS WHO WHO CAN AFFORD TO PROVIDE IT AND HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS. AND I I SIMPLY THINK WE JUST NEED TO TAKE A PAUSE AND ALLOW OUR ECONOMY THE OPPORTUNITY TO KIND OF STABILIZE AND THRIVE IN IN A NEW NORMAL WITHOUT CONTINUALLY ADDING. ADDITIONAL COSTLY AND AND BURDENSOME REGULATIONS ON ON BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES IN CALIFORNIA I APPRECIATE THE INTENT I KNOW A LOT OF THE RETAILERS THAT I SHOP WITH ARE NOW OFFERINGME THAT OPPORTUNITY I APPRECIATE. TO MY COLLEAGUES POINT THOUGH THAT THAT FIRST PART WHERE WE'RE SAYING IT'S PERMISSIVE AND KIND OF AN OPT IN OPT OUT BUT I KNOW I ALSO KNOW JUST THE TECHNOLOGICAL COST OF HAVING A FAMILY MEMBER WHO DOES CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS AS A LIVING-- AND WHAT HE CHARGES HIS YOU KNOW HIS CLIENTS FOR CHANGING OUT OF SERVICE IT'S PROHIBITIVE AND IT'S SOMETHING I'D RATHER SEE THAT EMPLOYER BE ABLE TO KEEP A FEW PART TIME EMPLOYEES ON STAFF AND MAKE THIS CHANGE. THANKS VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL COMMENTS A MISTER IRVING AHEAD. OF THAT I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY BUT I DO AGREE WITH THE CONCERNS THAT A LOT OF MONEY -- THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE -- MENTIONED BUT I APPRECIATE ALL THE EFFORTS THAT YOU'VE MADE SO FAR SO IT JUST TO REPEAT A COUPLE OF I WANT TO SEE YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE EFFECT ON SMALL BUSINESSES AND IS THE DEFINITION -- ACCURATE FOR FOR A MILLION DOLLARS BUT I DO HAVE TO SAY I DO -- OF GO TO A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HAD THAT ARE READY COMPLIANCE THAT ARE READY SAY YOU CAN USE ANY EMAIL OR OR GET NO RECEIPT AT ALL SO -- THEY MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A LOSS OF A PROBLEM THERE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT PRIVACY I'D WOULDN'T WANT ANYBODY TO HAVE TO GIVE AN EMAIL ADDRESS TO GET A RECEIPT. AND THEN FINALLY SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS -- THAT THAT YOU DO NEED TO BE WARY OF IS THAT WE JUST PASS SEE SEE PEOPLE YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN HAVING THE WHOLE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PRIVACY INITIATIVE. AND WHAT IS THE INTERACTION WITH YOUR BILL ON THE PRIVACY INITIATIVE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON MENTION THAT TO HOW HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT IT'S SOMEBODY FOR INSTANCE USES THE RIGHTTO BE FORGOTTEN. THAT -- THAT THEY'RE STILL ABLE TO RETURN THERE MACY'S PURCHASE SO -- LIKE I SAID YOU'VE BEEN A REALLY GREAT ABOUT OF THE TAKING AND PUT IN TRYING TO MAKE THIS -- AS FEASIBLE AS POSSIBLE SO -- I HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS. HOW ABSOLUTELY AGAIN YOU KNOW FOR FOR US WE ACTUALLY? WANT TO CONTINUE ON WORKING ON THE SMALL BUSINESS DEFINITION. I THINK IN TERMS OF PROOF OF PURCHASE FUND I'M SORT OF SCANNING THE COMMITTEE IS. HALF OF YOU ARE LOOKING AT DRY PHONES OR AT YOUR IPAD OR AT YOUR MAC BOOKS. AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO THAT SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN AND NOW -- THEY DON'T HAVE THE ONLY OPTION YOU HAVE IS IT IS A KEY RECEIPT. QUITE OFTEN AND MAYBE I'M THE EXCEPTION BUT QUITE OFTEN WHEN I GET A PAPER RECEIPT AND I WANT TO GO RETURN AN ITEM. I GO LOOKING FOR IT AND I CAN FIND THE THIRTY RECEIPTS I DON'T NEED BUT SOMEHOW I JUST CAN'T SEEM TO FIND THE RECEIPT OF THE ITEM THAT I NEED TO RETURN -- THE ONLY TIME THAT I'M GENERALLY SUCCESSFUL IS WHEN I GO IN GOOGLE MY EMAIL AND I CAN ACTUALLY FIND. SO -- I I DO UNDERSTAND EVERYONE'S DIFFERENT APPS MOST MANY PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY MORE ORGANIZED AND I AM AND HAVE A VERY -- EXCELLENT PAPER RECEIPT FILING SYSTEM UNFORTUNATELY I AM NOT ONE OF THEM SO SO FOR ME. HAVING THE E. RECEIPTS IS A BETTER BETTER BETTER PERSONAL OPTION FOR ME IN TERMS OF THE PROOF OF PURCHASE. I WOULD SAY IN TERMS OF INSTANTANEOUS RECOGNITION. NOW A DAYS WHEN I PAY WITH MY CREDIT CARD MY PHONE GETS THE TRANSACTION FASTER THAN I CAN EVEN PACK MY GROCERS. SO I'M IN I'M IN THE GROCERIES I THOUGHT THE CREDIT CARD I MEAN BOY THAT THAT BIT THAT CREDIT CARDS BEEN BUILT BEFORE I EVEN CAN GET MY ACHES IN THE GROCERY BACK. SO ON IN TERMS OF THE SPEED OF THIS I THINK -- GOING ELECTRONICALLY CAN BE MUCH FASTER. AGAIN THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE OPTION IF PEOPLE WANT PAPER AT THE ABSOLUTE CAN KEEP. ITS ITS PAPER RECEIPT UPON REQUEST WE'RE NOT SAYING YOU CAN'T GET PAPER ON WE CONTINUE TO AGAIN WANT WANT TO WORK WITH THIS IS KEY MAKE SURE THAT THE SMALL BUSINESS. DEFINITION IS AS ADEQUATE ON CALL YOU KNOW MOST OF US GET COFFEE OR TEA ACROSS THE STREET AT CHICORY YOU MIGHT NOTICE WHEN YOU PAY THAT IS A IT'S A DIGITAL TERMINAL MANY OF THOSE DIGITAL TERMINALS THAT ARE NEW ARE ACTUALLY MUCH CHEAPER. THAN THE OLD CREDIT CARD TERMINALS THAT ARE PURCHASED THROUGH THE OLD LEGACY TERMINALS THE FASTER THE BETTER IN THEIR CHEAPER. SO IT'S IT'S NO THIS NO RE IT'S NO REASON WHY SO MANY SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE SORT OF STARTING UP NOW THEY'RE OPTING INTO THOSE. PARTICULAR TERMINALS WE KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE A SHOE SHINE THIS NEWS WHETHER YOU'RE SELLING OFTEN SELLING COFFEE A WHOLE VARIETY OF THINGS. IN TERMS OF PRIVACY ACTUALLY VERY CONCERNED WE ARE HAPPY TO AGAIN WE WERE SILENT ON THE ISSUE SEPARATE FROM WHEN THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. WE WANT TO FOLLOW THIS COMMITTEES LEADS AND ALL THAT DISCUSSION SO WE DON'T BELIEVE OUR BILL -- DOES ANYTHING TO IMPACT WHAT THIS COMMITTEE DISCUSSION IN WHICH WOULD MERELY FOLLOW I BELIEVE WHAT THE COMMITTEE -- WOULD DISCUSS AGAIN TAKING OUR AMENDMENT SAYING THAT THE RECEIVED INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR MARKETING PURPOSES WE THINK IT IS A BIG STEP FORWARD AND AGAIN WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR. THE DIFFERENT PRIVACY DISCUSSIONS AS THEY MOVE FORWARD ALSO IN A ONE POINT OF SENSITIVITY WE KNOW THAT IN MANY RURAL COMMUNITIES YOU DON'T HAVE INTERNET SERVICE SO WE TOOK AN AMENDMENT SAYING. IF THERE'S AN OUTAGE OR YOU DON'T HAVE SERVICE THAT THIS ALSO DOES NOT APPLY BECAUSE WE DON'T WE DO KNOW IN SOME PLACES. IN OUR STATE. THERE IS A DIGITAL DIVIDE AND THERE IS NOT ACCESO WE ALSO WANTED TO BE VERY SENSITIVE TO THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS I I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORD. UP WITH HIS COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS I FEEL COMFORTABLE MOVING THE BILL FORWARD. OUR AND LOOKS LIKE -- WE DO HAVE A FEW ITEMS TO KIND OF TACKLE I GUESS ARE GOING FORWARD SO -- SO THE BILL IS GOING TO GO TO APPROPRIATIONS NEXT -- IS THERE A MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL. BILL'S BEEN MOVED TO I HAVE A SECOND. IT'S BEEN SECONDED DATA WHICH YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. REALLY PRETTY THE DISCUSSION AGAIN -- YOU HAVE MY WORD THAT WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK ON MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED -- THE DOES THIS AGAIN AT THE SECOND COMMITTEE BUT WE FULLY ANTICIPATE THERE WILL BE CONTINUED TO HAVE A VERY ROBUST DISCUSSION IN THE BE FURTHER CHANGES AS WE MOVE TO THE PROCESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH RESPECT DRESS RIGHT MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CHAO HI TELL AYE KILEY. KILEY NO BAUER-KAHAN. BAUER-KAHAN I BERMAN. BERMAN I CALDERON CALDERON HI GABRIEL [inaudible] GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER NO IRWIN OBERNOLTE. OBERNOLTE NO SMITH. SMITH NO WICKS. YOU HAVE FIVE VOTES WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ADDITIONAL MEMBERS THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE [inaudible] OKAY -- YEAH BRING SAYS TO MISS SALAMONE WELCOME AND YOU HAVE -- BILLY TWO BILLS -- ITEM FOURTEEN IS AB. SIX FORTY TWO AND SEVENTH ITEM SEVENTEEN IS AB ELEVEN EIGHTY ONE WHICH SHOW WHICH LIKE TO START WITH. START WITH SIX AT FORTY TWO PLEASE SIX TWENTY TWO ABSOLUTELY. ANYTHING. ANYTIME YOU'RE READY THANK YOU TURN MEMBERS AB SIX FORTY TWO WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR THE THOUSANDS OF CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. WHO ARE SERVED BY THE FINANCE LENDERS AND BROKERS LICENSE AND TO CALIFORNIA FINANCING LAW? UNDER THE EXISTING LAW THE DEFINITION OF BROKER IS VAGUE AND CIRCULAR LEADING TO CONFUSION FROM LENDERS ABOUT WHICH ENTITIES THEY CAN PARTNER WITH. WHEN ARRANGING LOANS FURTHER THE DEFINITION OF BROKER IN EXISTING LAW WAS FORMULATED LONG BEFORE THE RISE OF THE INTERNET AND THE EVOLUTION OF ONLINE LEAD GENERATION SO ARE A LOT NEEDS TO BE UPDATED WITH THIS ONLINE ACTIVITY IN MIND? THE GENERATOR'S PROVIDE VALUABLE MARKETING SERVICES TO A WIDE RANGE OF INDUSTRIES HOWEVER MANY ONLINE LEAD GENERATORS THAT SERVE THE LENDING INDUSTRY. PROVIDE MORE THAN JUST MARKETING SERVICES THESE ENTITIES ACT AS BROKERS WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THEY BRING BORROWERS AND LENDERS TOGETHER TO RANGE ALONE BASED ON CONFIDENTIAL THAT DATA PROVIDED BY A CONSUMER OR SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. THIS BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT ONLINE LEAD GENERATORS FROM OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA SIMPLY THIS BILL REQUIRES THREE BASIC THINGS FROM THE COMPANY'S ONE TO GET A BUSINESS LICENSE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENT DISCLOSURES TO THE CONSTRUCT AMER'S AND THREE OBTAIN. CUSTOMERS CONSENT BEFORE SELLING AND TRANSMITTING THEIR CONFIDENTIAL DATA IN ADDITION TO PROTECTIONS FROM CONSUMERS THIS BILL CLARIFIES RULES FOR ONLINE THE GENERATORS AND REFERRAL PROVIDERS IN THE SMALL BUSINESS LENDING SPACE THESE CLARIFICATIONS WILL HELP THE EMERGING. EMERGING FIN TECH COMPANIES THAT ARE PROVIDING VALUABLE ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. I WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH LENDERS AND LEE GENERATORS OVER THE LAST YEAR TO ENSURE THAT THIS BILL APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSES THE CONSUMER PROTECTION CONCERNS IN OUR LENDING MARKETS WITHOUT PLACING UNNECESSARY BURDENS ON THE BUSINESSES THAT WORK IN THIS AREA. DO LAST YEAR'S PROCESS I WAS ABLE TO GET A LARGE NUMBER OF CONSUMER AND COMMERCIAL LENDERS AND BROKERS COMFORTABLE WITH THIS APPROACH. I ALSO WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROTECTIONS IN THIS BILL. CAN BE APPROPRIATELY ENFORCED BY THE REGULATOR. LASTLY I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT SHARING COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS FOR THEIR HELPFUL SUGGESTIONS ON TAILORING THE DEFINITION OF CONFIDENTIAL DATA AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS IDENTIFIED IN THE ANALYSIS. TESTIFYING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL ARE MARINE MAHONEY FROM CONSUMER REPORTS AND CHRIS MATTER ON BEHALF OF ON DECK CAPITAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A FIRST WIN AS PLACE. TURNS OUT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. MY NAME'S MAUREEN HONEY AND ON BEHALF OF CONSUMER REPORTS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. ONLINE LENDING IS THE FASTEST GROWING CHANNEL WHERE CONSUMERS FALL INTO HIGH COST LOANS WITH TRIPLE DIGIT INTEREST RATES. ONLINE LENDERS ARE HEAVILY RELIANT ON THE GENERATORS TOGETHER CONSUMERS FINANCIAL INFORMATION INTO FINAL THAT DATA BACK TO LENDERS COMPETE AGAINST EACH OTHER FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SELL THE CONSUMER ALONE. CALIFORNIA LAW IS UNCLEAR ON HOW THESE ONLINE THE GENERATORS ARE REGULATED SO THIS BILL IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BY MAKING IT CLEAR THAT THESE COMPANIES NEED A LICENSE AND OVERSIGHT. FROM THE STATE FINANCIAL REGULATOR. GOING TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR EVEN STRONGER REGULATIONS INCLUDING AN INTEREST RATE CAP ON THESE LOANS BUT THIS BILL WILL BRING THESE COMPANIES OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND ENSURE GREATER TRANSPARENCY. A WE SUPPORT THIS REASONABLE APPROACH AND WE ARE DRIVE A THANK YOU THANK YOU MATCH NEXT WHEN HIS PLACE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CHRISTMAS OUR BEHALF OF ON DECK CAPITAL WHICH IS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- DECAPOLIS OUT LARGEST ONLINE SMALL BUSINESS LENDING PLATFORM UNITED STATES AND USES TECHNOLOGY TO EXPAND ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR AMERICA'S SMALL BUSINESSES. ON DECK IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING IT SMALL BUSINESSES CUSTOMERS WITH FAIR AND TRANSPARENT FINANCING OPTIONS SO THEY CAN FOUGHT FOCUS ON WHAT THEY DO BEST. WHICH IS GROWING THEIR BUSINESSES HIRING WORKERS AND FUELING THEIR LOCAL ECONOMIES. SIX FORTY TWO WILL PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED CLARITY ON THE TREATMENT OF DIFFERENT REFERRAL RELATIONSHIPS ON THE CALIFORNIA FINANCE FINANCING LAW WHICH CURRENTLY HAS CREATED UNCERTAINTY. FOR COMMERCIAL LENDERS AND THEIR BUSINESS PARTNERS REGARDING WHAT ACTIVITIES ARE PERMISSIBLE AND OR SUBJECT IN LICENSURE. IN CALIFORNIA THE CFL'S ALSO FAILED TO KEEP. PACE WITH TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGICAL -- INNOVATIONS IN ONLINE MARKETING REFERRAL AND BROKERING ACTIVITIES. BY PROVIDING CLEAR DISTINCTIONS AMONG BROKERING A REFERRAL ACTIVITIES AND ALLOWING CERTAIN FLEXIBILITY IN THE COMPENSATION ARRANGER ARRANGEMENTS PERMITTED THERE UNDER. AB SIX FOUR TWO WILL PROVIDE GREATER LEGAL CERTAINTY CREATE A MORE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR EXISTING CFL LICENSEES AND OPEN THE DOOR. FOR MORE COMPANIES TO EXPLORE LICENSURE UNDER THE CFL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- ADDITIONAL -- SUPPORTERS. TO CHAIR MEMBERS MIKE MADA GOING TO BE HAVE THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. OPPOSITION PLEASE COME ON UP WELCOME. THANK YOU -- CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS JASON RON BROWN I WORK FOR A COMPANY IN LOS ANGELES CALL LONG CALL CALIFORNIA. WITH OTHER DETAIL AND SEE IF A LICENSE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN OUR CORE BUSINESS IS LEAD GENERATION. WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHEN THEY HEAR LEAD GENERATION SOME PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS AN HONOR PEOPLE THINK IT'S A SIMPLE PROCESS IS VERY COMPLEX. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE D. B. O. AND WITH -- CHAIR ONE OF THEM ON FOR THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS I'M TRYING TO CRAFT. LEAD GENERALIZING SAYING AND IT'S COMPLICATED BECAUSE THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS ON THE TECHNICALITY SO I AGREE WITH -- CHAIR WOMANLY MON THAT THERE ARE THREE SIMPLE COMPONENTS HERE. AS SHE SAID LICENSING DISCLOSURE AND CONSENT OUR PROBLEM IN OUR OPPOSITION IS NOT THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ISSUE. IT'S IT'S THE TECHNICALITY ON HOW DISCLOSURES AND CONSENT NEED TO BE PRESENTED SO THE REALITY IS IN THIS LEAD JEN UNIVERSE CONSUMERS GO ONLINE. LOOKING FOR A SOLUTION AND THEY WANT SOMETHING QUICK AND THEY WANT SOMETHING CERTAIN THEY WANT IT NOW. SO THE BAD GUYS WHO ARE OUT THERE AND THEY ARE THIS IS NOT ANECDOTAL THERE REALLY OUT THERE. THEY USE FALSE ADVERTISING LIKE NO CREDIT CHECK LOANS GUARANTEED APPROVAL INSTANT FUNDING WE HAVE TO COMPETE WITH THEM. BUT WE MAKE SURE OUR ADVERTISING IS TRUTHFUL. AND WE ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE THAT OUR LENDERS THE BAD GUYS DON'T THAT ANYBODY BECAUSE THEY JUST WANT TO STEAL INFORMATION. AND SELL IT OR USE IT FOR FISHING THEIR SCAM WEBSITES OUT THERE IT'S ALL OVER THE INTERNET. SO WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO DO WORKING WITH THE BILL AUTHOR. IS. TO CLARIFY THE DISCLOSURES AND THE CONSENT REQUIREMENTS SO THE GOOD ETHICAL LEE GENERATORS CAN STILL DO BUSINESS AND COMPETE WITH THE BAD GUYS. THE BAD GUYS AREN'T GOING AWAY WE ALL KNOW THAT SO WHAT WE NEED IS LEGISLATION THAT WILL ALLOW COMPANIES TO SAY YES I WANT TO GET. A BROKER LICENSE YES I WANT TO MAKE THESE DISCLOSURES IN THE CONSENT BECAUSE IF WE DON'T GET PEOPLE TO BUY INTO IT. WE LOSE THE BEST CONSUMER PROTECTION WE HAVE THE BEST CONSUMER PROTECTION WE HAVE ARE REGULATED. ETHICAL LEAD GENERATORS. AND THE OTHER COMPANIES I'M PART OF THE ONLINE LENDERS ALLIANCE AND I WORK WITH A LOT OF WE GENERATORS THAT AREN'T LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA. THEY DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK THEY CAN MAKE IT WORK. IT'S NOT THE CONCEPT IT'S THE TECHNICALITIES HOW CONSENT IS OBTAINED HOW DISCLOSURE MADE AND WHEN SO WE ARE OPPOSED UNLESS WE CAN. CLEAN THAT UP BECAUSE WE WANT. THE LICENSING WE WANT THE CONSUMER PROTECTION. EXCUSE ME THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US FIGURE MATCHA. ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. ALLENTOWN IS ON BEHALF OF THE SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE ASSOCIATION YES BFA IS THE LARGEST ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING MARKETPLACE COMMERCIAL LENDERS. RECALL LAST YEAR SB TWELVE THIRTY FIVE WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATION SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR AND IS GOING THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS OF DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. WE BELIEVE THAT SIX FORTY TWO ALL THE WELL INTENTIONED WASHER CONFLICT WITH A LOT OF THE REGULATORY PROCESS THAT'S GOING ON NOW. AND THEN WE'LL HAVE CONFLICTING REQUIREMENTS RESPECT TO TWELVE THIRTY FIVE AND SIX FORTY TWO RELATING TO A COMMERCIAL LENDERS WE WOULD REQUEST THAT THE SECTIONS RELATING TO COMMERCIAL LENDING COME OUT OF THE BILL. LET THE REGULATORY PROCESS WORKS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SB. SIX TWELVE THIRTY FIVE AND THEN COME BACK IN A COUPLE YEARS ONCE THE REGULATORY PROCESS IS DONE AND DO A SEPARATE COMMERCIAL LENDING -- REGULATORY REGIME. FOR LEAD GENERATING AND BROKERING SO WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE.

YOU HAVE FULL VOTES WILL LEAVE THE ROAD OPEN FOR A ABSENT MEMBERS LATER. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU DO HAVE A SECOND BILL AND THAT IS ITEM OF SEVENTEEN AB ELEVEN EIGHTY ONE SO WITH THAT ANYTIME YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU TERM MEMBERS ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN EIGHTY ONE INSURERS THAT ALL CHARITIES REPORTING GIFT IN KIND OR NON MONETARY DONATIONS TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S REGISTRY OF CHARITABLE TRUSTS. DO SO UNDER THE SAME UNIFORM TRANSPARENT RULES CREATING A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD IS IMPORTANT TO PROTECT BOTH CHARITIES AND DONORS FROM MISLEADING OR CONFUSING FINANCIAL REPORTING SPECIFICALLY. THIS BILL FOCUSES ON A UNIQUE SITUATION WHERE GIFTS IN KIND DONATION IS RESTRICTED BY THE DONOR SO THAT IT CANNOT BE USED IN THE UNITED STATES. FOR EXAMPLE A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY MAY REQUIRE CHARITY TO USE A DONATION OVERSEAS AND NOT INSIDE THE U. S. MARKET. SINCE THE VALUE OF THAT DONATION IS HIGHLY VARIABLE THIS BILL CLARIFIES THAT CHARITY SHOULD REPORT USING THE FAIR VALUE. OF THE END RECIPIENT MARKET AND NOT ITS VALUE IN THE UNITED STATES. IF THE DONATION IS NOT RESTRICTED THAN THE BILL DOES NOT APPLY. OVER EVALUATION OF GIFT IN KIND LEADS TO AN INFLATED TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE CHARITY WHICH MAKES THE CHARITY PURE MORE. SUCCESSFUL AND EFFICIENT TO THE PUBLIC AND POTENTIAL DONORS AB ELEVEN EIGHTY ONE IT IS NECESSARY TO CLARIFY FOR NON PROFITS AND DONORS WHAT REPORTING PRACTICES ARE TRANSPARENT AND FAIR FOR ALL INVOLVED. I HAVE WITH ME AT TODAY TIME A MINUS FROM ARE THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE IT A SET TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A FIRST WHEN HIS PLACE OF THING HI I'M ANTHONY LIEU OF FULL FROM THE AG'S OFFICE AND WE JUST. WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE FOR THE THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE BILL. WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR LEADERSHIP ON NONPROFIT ISSUES AND ALSO FOR PARTNERING WITH US. ON AB ELEVEN EIGHTY ONE WHICH SEEKS TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCURACY. IN REPORTING OF GIFT IN KIND -- BY CHARITY SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE EIGHTEEN AND A HALF TONYA HERE TO SPEAK MORE ABOUT THE THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION. MY NAME IS TANYA YOU'VE IDEAS AND I'M THE SENIOR ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL IN CHARGE OF THE CHARITABLE TRUSTS SECTION WHICH INVESTIGATES AND PROSECUTES AGAINST CHARITIES. FOR IMPROPER REPORTING A MISLEADING SOLICITATION. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE YET TO SET A IS SPONSORING AB. ELEVEN EIGHTY ONE TO PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY TO PROTECT DONORS TO PROMOTE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD AMONGST CHARITIES AND TO PREVENT NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS FROM ARBITRARILY. AND ECOLOGICALLY USING US PRICES TO ARTIFICIALLY INFLATE THE VALUE OF GIFT IN KIND DONATIONS THAT CANNOT BE USED. IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF DONNA RESTRICTIONS FROM THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. OUR LAWSUIT IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN AGAINST THE NATIONAL CANCER SOCIETY ABOUT COALITION DEMONSTRATES ON HOW CHARITIES EFFECTIVELY USE GIFTING BEHIND VALUATIONS. USING US PRICES TO ARTIFICIALLY BUMP UP THEIR REVENUE AND THEIR PROGRAM SERVICES. THE NATIONAL CANCER COALITION WAS ABLE TO INCREASE ITS REVENUE IN TWO YEARS. FROM SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE TO TO TO SEPTEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN FROM TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS. TO A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS USING U. S. PRICES. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE DONATIONS IT RECEIVED UPWARDS OF THESE WERE PHARMACEUTICALS THAT COULD NOT BE USED IN THE UNITED STATES THEY WERE RESTRICTED BY THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES THEY COULD ONLY BE USED IN FOREIGN NATIONS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE PHARMACEUTICALS WENT TO COUNTRIES SUCH AS NICARAGUA AND GUATEMALA. BUT BY USING US PRICES TO VITAL DIVIDE VALUE EIGHT THESE GIFT IN KIND DONATIONS. ARE THE CHARITY WAS ABLE TO TELL ITS DONORS THAT NINETY SEVEN POINT 7% OF ALL OF ITS ASSETS WERE USED TOWARDS ITS CHARITABLE PROGRAMS. AND THAT ONLY HALF A PERCENT WAS USED FOR ITS ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. AND LESS THAN 2% WAS USED FOR FUND RAISING EXPENSES HAD THEY USED INTERNATIONAL VALUES FOR THESE DONATIONS. THE REVENUE THAT WERE THEY REPORTED AS WELL AS THE PROGRAM SERVICES THAT THEY REPORTED TO DONORS WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS THAN CALIFORNIA DONORS DONATED GENEROUSLY TO THIS CHARITY IN TWO YEARS OVER TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DONORS IN CALIFORNIA DONATED HALF A MILLION HALF A MILLION DOLLARS TO THIS JERRY. AND DOMESTICALLY THAT CHARITY ONLY PROVIDED THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN PHARMACEUTICALS TO US RESIDENTS. THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND YET THEY WERE ABLE TO REPORT A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS AND PROGRAM SERVICES -- AND THE CHARITY PROVIDED NO SERVICES TO U. S. CANCER PATIENTS FOR DIRECT ASSISTANCE MAMMOGRAM OR OTHER. DIAGNOSTIC TESTING. AREN'T YOU WILL HEAR -- THAT THIS -- THAT THE ACCOUNTANTS THAT ARE OPPOSING THIS BILL -- HAVE GIVEN US VALUABLE FEEDBACK AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE OPEN TO RECEIVE FEEDBACK. BASED ON THESE COMMENTS WE HAVE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE MONN WHICH ARE BEFORE YOU DID TODAY WE BELIEVE THAT THESE AMENDMENTS COVER MOST OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION. AND WHILE MANY OF THE OPPOSITION'S BELONG TO A COUNTY MEMBERSHIP GROUPS THAT BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL SHOULD NOT GO FORWARD BECAUSE THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD -- WANTS TO RESEARCH THIS ISSUE TO SEE IF THERE'S A PROBLEM THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM. IT IS EXISTED FOR WELL OVER TEN YEARS IT IS WIDESPREAD SEVERAL STATES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA HAVE SU CHARITIES FOR USING THESE REPORTING GIMMICKS. AND THE PROBLEM IN EVALUATING GIFT IN KIND DONATIONS USING US PRICES. IS NOT ONLY OVER VALUE WAITING THE REVENUE THAT THESE CHARITIES ARE REPORTING BUT THEIR SERVICE. AND FAST BE WHICH IS THE ORGANIZATION THAT PROMOTES RULES FOR ACCOUNTANTS IS NOT PROMISING TO FIX THE PROBLEM HERE WHETHER THERE ARE THERE'S THEY'VE THEY'VE TOLD YOU AND THEY'RE A LADDER. THAT THEY HAVE PUT TOGETHER A WORKING GROUP TO EVALUATE WHETHER THERE IS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE FAXED. DONOR INTENT A DONOR RESTRICTIONS. IT'S NOT EVEN MENTION AND FAST NEWSLETTER -- IS POLICIES LETTER TO THIS COMMITTEE. BASICALLY IGNORES DONOR INTACT AND THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA AND IN OTHER STATE DONOR INTENT MATTERS. IT IS LEGALLY REQUIRED UNDER STATUTE AND OUR CASE LAW AND BECAUSE OF THAT THIS BILL IS NEEDED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL SUPPORT [inaudible] OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JIM GROSS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS. FIRST LET ME SAY THAT -- THE SOCIETY AGREES WITH. THE GOAL OF THIS BILL WE HAVE NO DESIRE TO SEE ANY CHARITY MISS REPRESENT. THE VALUE OF ANY OF ITS ASSETS OR TO USE IT'S REPORTING TO RAISE FUNDS WHEN THE INFORMATION PROVIDED TO DONORS. IS INADEQUATE. THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE FOR THE CPA SOCIETY. IS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER IT IS APPROPRIATE. TO CHANGE GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IS NOT WILLING TO WAIT UNTIL. THEORGANIZATIONS ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL COMPLETE THEIR PROCESS FOR DETERMINING A ANOTHER WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM. HOWEVER I HAVE REPRESENTED THE ACCOUNTING PROFESSION FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. AND NEVER HAVE I ENCOUNTERED A BILL IN THIS LEGISLATURE. THAT WOULD CHANGE. GENERAL LEE ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. I WOULD TELL YOU THAT IF ANY OF YOU CALLED YOUR OWN CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT. AND ASKED WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE IDEA OF IN A CIRCUMSTANCE INVOLVING A NONPROFIT THAT YOU WOULD NOT APPLY GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. BUT RATHER A NOTHER FORMULA. EVERYONE OF THOSE CPA'S WOULD SAY. HOW ARE WE GOING TO DEVIATE FROM GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES WHICH ARE THE BEDROCK OF WHAT? CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS USED IN EVERY AUDIT IN EVERY PREPARATION. OF TAX RETURNS X. AT REX FEDERAL. WE HAVE OFFERED AN ALTERNATIVE. TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE A SEPARATE ALTERNATIVE FROM WAITING. FOR ACTION BY FAST BE IN THE LIKE. AND THAT IS TO USE OTHER FORMS OF DISCLOSURE. TO ENSURE THAT THE POTENTIAL DONORS UNDERSTAND. THE VALUATION PROCESS. BUT TO INSTEAD CHANGE GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES WHICH ARE FRANKLY THE PHYSICS. OF THE ACCOUNTING PROFESSION. YOU ARE TAKING A VERY RADICAL STEP. THAT WE BELIEVE. IS CLEARLY A SLIPPERY SELF SLOPE WHICH WE CAN NEVER AGREE WITH. SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. AND WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO FIND A DIFFERENT WAY TO ADDRESS THE DISCLOSURE ISSUE BUT THE ISSUE OF CHANGING GAP IS FUNDAMENTALLY UNACCEPTABLE THANK YOU THANK YOU MATCHING NEXT WHEN HIS WAYS A SHEPHERD ON BEHALFOF THE NONPROFIT ALLIANCE RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. EVERY CHARITY IS REQUIRED BY THE IRS ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES TO VALUE ITS GIFT IN KIND USING THE SAME ACCOUNTING METHOD ON THE RETURN INCLUDING THE FORM NINE NINETY AND ALL SCHEDULES. TO REPORT REVENUE AND EXPENSES THAT IS REGULARLY THAT IT REGULARLY USES TO KEEP ITS BOOKS AND RECORDS THAT IS PER THE FORM NINE NINETY INSTRUCTIONS AS OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE VARIATION FOR A CALIFORNIA FINALLY PROPOSED BY ELEVEN EIGHTY ONE WITH REQUIRE CHARITIES TO DEVOTE CONSIDERABLE RESEARCH. RESOURCES TO RESEARCH AND RECALCULATE THEIR AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO COMPLY WITH A SINGLE STATES READ. AT RE VERSIONING OF A FAIR MARKET VALUE DEFINITION. RESOURCES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE SPENT O IMPACTFUL DELIVERY OF LIFESAVING MISSIONS WILL INSTEAD BE USED TO RESEARCH WHOLE MARKET. WHOLESALE MARKET VALUES FOR PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BEEN DELIVERED TORN ORGANIZATIONS US LOCATION BUT NOT YET DISTRIBUTED TO AN END RECIPIENT MARKET AT THE END OF A CHARITIES FISCAL. YEAR AND IN SOME CASES SUCH AS NATURAL DISASTER RECOVERY WITHOUT PRECISE KNOWLEDGE ON WHERE THE GOODS WILL BE NEEDED AND SHIPPED. THE UNNECESSARY BURDENSOME REQUIREMENTS OF BY THE BELL -- FOR ACCOUNTING STANDARDS THE CALIFORNIA'S FILING A EXPONENTIALLY AND THREATENING TO CHARITIES RESOURCES -- WHEN WE CONSIDER WHAT THIS BILL -- COULD SET -- AND FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED THEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- ADDITIONAL -- OPPOSITION. SEEING AND HEARING NONE OF BACK TO COMMITTEE -- QUESTION COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. A MISTER OBERNOLTE. SO I HAD A QUESTION FOR THE OPPOSITION -- I THINK THE AUTHOR IS RAISED A VERY. A REAL AND TANGIBLE PROBLEM WITH THAT WERE EXPERIENCING WITH EVALUATION OF THESE ASSETS -- WITH CHARITIES NOW -- IT AND I RECOGNIZE THE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT -- GAP PRINCIPLES HOW WOULD YOU SOLVE THE PROBLEM THEM IF NOT WHAT SHE'S PROPOSED WELL I THANK YOU STRUGGLE NOTI THROUGH THE CHAIR. THE THE ISSUE IS HOW DO YOU REFLECT. A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. THE VALUE THAT MAY OCCUR UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND AS THEY POINT OUT WHAT THAT PRODUCT MAY BE WORTH. WHEN IT'S DISTRIBUTED? IN SOME OTHER PLACE IN THE WORLD WE HAVE OFFERED SPECIFIC LANGUAGE THAT WOULD BE USED TO DISCLOSE THAT WITHOUT DEVIATING FROM GAP. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS MANY TOOLS AVAILABLE AND CAN WORK WITH US TO ENSURE THAT THE CITY TO IS ANOTHER FORMS ARE FILED WITH THE AG. AND THE STATE TAX RETURN DOES ACCURATELY REFLECT THAT. WITHOUT SAYING BUT DON'T APPLY GAP AND THAT'S OUR THAT'S OUR FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM. SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO DISCUSS WITH THEM WAYS. TO GIVE DONORS AND UNDERSTANDING OF THAT DIFFERENTIAL BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE CHANGING. ALRIGHT SO THROUGH THE CHAIR OF THE TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WHAT WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS PROPOSED. I CAN JUST SAY FRESNO WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH OPPOSITION AND TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT WE DID NOT RECEIVE THE FAX ME A LETTER UNTIL MONDAY YESTERDAY AT BELIEVE. PREVIOUS TO THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE CAL CP GAMES. ON WHAT I THINK ARE SIMILAR SORT OF OVERLAPPING CONCERNS BUT NOT -- NOT ENOUGH TIME. TO GET TO THOSE SO I HOPE THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO KEEP MOVING THIS FOR WITH THAT PASSED THE LETTER WAS THIS MAY KNOWN TO US YESTERDAY -- AND THAT BEING SAID I MEAN WE HAD TO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC. RESPONSES ABOUT THAT I WOULD SAY THAT. NO WE ARE INTERESTED IN. PRECLUDING THIS UNDERLYING REPORTING PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE INSTEAD OF ALLOWING IT TO HAPPEN AND THEN PUT AN ASTERISK ON IT HEY YOU SEE THE LITTLE DISCLAIMER -- DISCLOSURE ABOUT IT SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN TRY TO WORK THIS OUT. WE'RE CERTAINLY COMMITTED TO DOING THAT -- AND I'LL MAIL IT TIENEN RESPOND MORE SPECIFICALLY BUT AGAIN WE HAVE A LOT OF DISCUSSION THAT HAS TO OCCUR. YOU KNOW AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD ON THIS PART I WILL MISS THE MORE I THINK YOU'VE RAISED A VERY A REAL ISSUE. AND I DON'T THINK THAT THESE CHARITIES OUGHT TO BE VALUE IN THIS VERY SPECIFIC CLASS OF ASSET THE WAY THAT THEY ARE -- BUT I DO THINK THE OPPOSITION ALSO HAS A POINT THAT WE SHOULDN'T DEVIATE FROM GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BECAUSE THAT. PUTS US IN A SEPARATE CATEGORY THAN  ENTIRE COUNTRY WHICH IS VERY PROBLEMATIC SO I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY I'D LIKE TO ENCOURAGE YOU. TO TRY AND WORK OUT SOME LANGUAGE THAT STILL COMPLIES WITH GAP -- IN THE END AT THE SAME TIME SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A MIDDLE GROUND HERE. WE HOPE THAT THERE IS A MIDDLE GROUND WE'VE IDENTIFIED. THE ISSUE AT YOU KNOW I I WORK A LOT WITH NON PROFITS AND MY TAKE ON THIS IS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AN ISSUE WITH REPORTING FOR CHARITIES AND WE JUST DON'T WANT THAT TO BE AN ISSUE FOR THE NON PROFITS AND WE THAT THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO HAVE. SOME UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S REPORTABLE AND HOW IT'S REPORTABLE AND JUST FOR THOSE THAT DON'T FOLLOW IT'S AS REAL SMALL SLIVER -- OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF DONATIONS -- THIS IS NOT ALL DONATIONS THIS IS HAS TO BE DONE -- SPECIFIC -- SO I I WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR THIS IS A SMALL PROBLEM ON A SMALL SLIVER BUT BIG ENOUGH PROBLEM FOR US TO SAY WE DON'T WANT NONPROFITS TO HAVE. TO DEAL WITH IT YOU KNOW ATTORNEY GENERAL AND COMPLIANCE ISSUES AND SO THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR US AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM AND CERTAINLY WE WILL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH OPPOSITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS ALSO BUT I THINK THE FIRST QUESTION HAS BEEN ANSWERED PARTIALLY BY BY THE OPPOSITION. AND THE ORIGINAL QUESTION WAS WHETHER OR NOT IT REALLY -- WAS REALLY DOT BURDENSOME TO LET'S SAY GO FROM GAP TOO FAST BE FOR EXAMPLE AND YOU KNOW -- OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW SUBJECTING MYSELF TO TWO DIFFERENT REGULATORY ACCOUNTING. METHODS WOULD BE PUT IN SOME I MEAN NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT AND THE QUESTION ORIGINALLY WAS WHETHER OR NOT IT'S DOABLE. YOU KNOW FOR YOU KNOW FOR FOR YOU FOLKS TO BASICALLY GO FROM ONE SYSTEM TO ANOTHER FROM YOUR CAP TOO FAST BE. SUE BUT IF THERE'S A MIDDLE GROUND THAT WOULD BE -- YOU KNOW ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH PARTIES I THINK YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE THE SOLUTION BUT I DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT -- WE DO HAVE A REAL PROBLEM AND YOU HAVE JUST DONE HEARING FROM FROM THE AG'S OFFICE OF OF ALL THE EXAMPLES THAT WE WILL BE CITED I THINK YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE A REAL PROBLEM. AND DOT I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AG'S OFFICE THEY'LL. KNOW THE BILL BASICALLY REQUIRES THE VALUATION TO TAKE PLACE AT THE DESTINATION OF THE LET'S SAY THE DONATION -- N. OR AT THE TIME OF THE RECEIPT SO THE QUESTION IS IF. IF THAT IS THE CASE THEN WOULDN'T YOU ALSO BE CREATING SOME SOMEWHAT OF A VARIATION. IN THE VALUATION PROCESS ITSELF BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE VALUATION -- COULD FLUCTUATE FROM ONE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER SO YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CONSISTENCY THROUGHOUT -- THROUGHOUT THAT PROCESS SO SOME WONDERING IF THAT'S AN ISSUE BUT I THINK COMPARED. TO COMPARED TO THE CURRENT SYSTEM I THINK IS STILL BETTER BUT YET I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S AN ISSUE. ARE YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO TO THE VALUATION OF THE DONATION ITSELF WELL WHITE SOME CHARITIES I MEAN THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE CHARITIES THAT ACCEPT RESTRICTED DONATIONS IT CANNOT BE USED IN THE UNITED STATES TO DO SOME ADDITIONAL HOMEWORK. TO EVALUATE THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE GIFT -- THEY'RE ALREADY DOING THIS. WITH THEIR ACCOUNTANTS WHEN THEY'RE FILING THE IRS -- FORM -- NINE NINETY THE ACCOUNTS AND THE CHARITIES HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ASSETS ARE RESTRICTED WHAT ARE TEMPORARY RESTRICTED AND WATER PERMANENTLY RESTRICTED SO THIS HOME WORK CAN BE DONE ALSO DONATIONS THAT ARE NOT APPROVED BY THE FDA. THEY CAN'T USE US PRICES FOR THOSE DONATIONS SO THEY'VE HAD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE FAIR MARKET VALUE THE WAY THINGS STAND RIGHT NOW WITH FAST BE. IS THAT THEY GET TO USE THE BEST. PRICE THE BEST PRICE. OF AVAILABLE FOR THE DRUG AND THEY GET TO USE US PRICES EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW AT THE TIME THEY GET THE DONATION OR SHORTLY THERE AFTER THAT IT'S GONNA GO TO KENYA. AND SO THIS IS RESULTED IN UNBELIEVABLY RIDICULOUS RESULTS WERE CHARITIES ARE BASICALLY INCREASING THE PRICES OF DONATIONS. 81000%. I MEAN THAT'S JUST ABSURD AND IF THIS WAS A MUTUAL FUND. YOU WOULD GO CRAZY RIGHT IF IF YOUR MUTUAL FUND ADVISORS COULD INCREASE. THE VALUE OF THEIR FUNDS AND YET CHARITIES ARE DOING THIS TIME AFTER TIME BECAUSE FAST BE HAS NOT ACTED AND FAST BE THUS FAR DOES NOT CONSIDER DONOR RESTRICTIONS. AND SO CAN IT BE DONE YES IT CAN BE DONE WILL IT REQUIRE WORK YES IT WILL BE RE REQUIRE WORK BUT IT CAN BE DONE. AND IT WILL PROMOTE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR CHARITIES THAT ARE PUT ACCEPTING PREDOMINATELY CASH DONATIONS. THESE CHARITIES CAN'T COMPETE WITH DONATIONS LIKE SOME OF THESE CHARITIES ARE GETTING WORRIED ALMOST ALL PHARMACEUTICALS THERE'S NO COMPETITION. I THINK YOU'RE A MAJOR. ARM ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SO. CAN I HAVE A MOTION. BUILT IN MOVED AND SECONDED THE MOTION IS TO PASSED AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS A WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THEIR STEADFAST FRIEND AYE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SAU HI SO I KILEY. KILEY I'VE BAUER-KAHAN BAUER-KAHAN I BERMAN. CALDERON. CALDERON HI GABRIEL. GABRIEL I GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER I IRWIN. IRWIN OBERNOLTE. OBERNOLTE AYE SMITH. SMITH HI WEEKS. WICKS I AND OF THE BILLS OUT. TEN ZERO ON TOP RACES TO MISTER MERRETT SHOOTS SHE ITEM NUMBER TWENTY AND THAT'S BILL NUMBER. TWELVE EIGHTY SIX WELCOME -- ANYTIME YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I UNDERSTAND THAT I STAND BETWEEN YOU AND DINNER AND SO I'LL TRY TO KEEP. BRIEF -- THE I BELIEVE THIS IS YOUR YOUR LAST BILL THE DAY -- ONE MORE ONE MORE OKAY MORAL KEEP IT EVE EVEN MORE CONCISE. I'M HERE TO PRESENT TO ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE ONE TWELVE EIGHTY SIX THIS IS MY EASE SCOOTERS AND SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES BILL. THE GOALS OF THIS BILL OUR PUBLIC SAFETY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION. WE'VE SEEN THE SCOOTERS AND BIKES -- HERE IN SACRAMENTO AS WELL AS PERHAPS IN OUR DISTRICTS -- THEY CAN BE AS WE KNOW FUND AFFORDABLE AND ECO FRIENDLY WAYS TO GET AROUND. HOWEVER WITH ANY NEW INNOVATION PROP INNOVATIVE PRODUCT OR SERVICE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S SAFE FOR BOTH USERS AND PEDESTRIANS WITH BASIC CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. THIS BILL -- WOULD REQUIRE THREE BASIC -- ITEMS ONE THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES ADOPTED SAFETY RULES BEFORE THESE PRODUCTS CAN BE ROLLED OUT IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. TO MINIMUM INSURANCE TO PROTECT BOTH WRITERS AS WELL AS THIRD PARTIES. AND THREE A PROHIBITION ON WAIVERS OF LEGAL RIGHTS. OF BEFORE I PROCEED ANY FURTHER I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF. FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS BILL I ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS AND NOTED ON PAGES SIX SEVEN AND EIGHT OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. I WILL FURTHER LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT -- WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY -- ENGAGED IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL. AND AS A RESULT OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS NUMBER ONE WE HAVE AGREED TO REMOVE THE ARBITRATION PROVISION. OF THE BILL -- THAT -- IT IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WITH THAT REMOVAL OF THE ARBITRATION PROVISION HAT -- THE THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OVER ROOM REMOVING THIS BILL FROM THEIR JOB KILLER LIST -- TOO I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE THE THE CONCERNS THAT I'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AS IT RELATES. TO USE OR CONDUCT THAT THAT THE CONDUCT OF THOSE THAT ARE USING THE SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES IT IS CERTAINLY NOT MY INTENT. THAT. THAT THE PROVIDERS COVER -- YOU KNOW FOR THE LIABILITY BECAUSE BY DRUNK AND RECKLESS AND OR RECKLESS DRIVERS AND SO -- WE WILL BE -- CLARIFYING THE THEY THE LANGUAGE TAKING AMENDMENTS WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO ENSURE. THAT -- THIS BILL REFLECTS MY INTENT LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST I'VE HEARD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF THE MINIMUM LIABILITY INSURANCE -- THAT THOSE AMOUNTS ARE SUBJECT TO ON GOING -- CONVERSATIONS IN NEGOTIATIONS THAT WERE HAVING BUT BOTTOM LINE IS THAT I'M ENGAGED AND CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS TO ENSURE. THE BASIC GOALS OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION I'M HERE WITH THE THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA WHO ARE THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR FIRST WITNESS PLEASE [inaudible] THE GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS LAWRENCE RUSSO AND I LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO. I'M HERE TODAY TO URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF AB. TWELVE EIGHTY SIX I WAS IN SAN DIEGO IN OCTOBER AFTER COMPLETING THE THREE HUNDRED MILE BIKE RIDE FROM SANTA BARBARA. IN SUPPORT OF THE CALIFORNIA BICYCLE COALITION. AFTER THE RIDE UP I DECIDED TO REMAIN IN SAN SAN DIEGO FOR A FEW DAYS. AND VISIT THE NAYS NAVAL BASE AS I AM. A NAVAL VETERAN MYSELF. I WAS GOING TO TAKE THE TROLLEY TO THE BASE. WHEN I LEARNED THAT? IT WAS QUITE A WALK TO THE TROLLEY LINE. I DECIDE TO GRAB MY HELMET AND SET UP TO RENT A BIRD SCOOTER. TO GET TO THE TROLLEY STATION. I RENTED TO BIRD SCOOTERS THE PREVIOUS DAY. WAS SO I WAS FAMILIAR WITH. THEIR OPERATION. WHILE ON THE SCOOTER. I BEGAN TO DESCEND THE HILL. WHICH BECAME A LITTLE STEEP. WHAT I APPLIED THE BRAKES? THEY DIDN'T WORK. THE BRAKES FAILED. IMMEDIATELY I ASK MYSELF WHAT SHOULD I DO. ONE THING THAT CAME TO MIND WAS DRIVING. OR RIDING OVER SOMEONE'S DRIVEWAY AND HOPE I CAN GO OVER THE RETAINING WALL. THEN I LOOKED DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL AND I SAW THAT THE ROAD COMING IN FROM THE RIGHT WAS. IN THE SENDING ONE SO I THOUGHT MAYBE I CAN MAKE IT TO THE BOTTOM AND AND CLIMB UP THAT HILL TO SLOW DOWN. I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING AFTER THAT. I BLACKED OUT AND I ENDED UP IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM IT. UCSD [inaudible] OUR WITH DOCTOR. EMERGENCY ROOM ASKING ME. A COUPLE QUESTIONS DILLON NO MY NAME. IN MY BIRTHDATE. HE THEN INFORMED ME THAT THE TEAM WANTED TO TAKE ME TO THE ARE -- THE CLEAN UP MY WOUNDS HE HAS ALSO ASKED ME IF I WOULD AGREE TO DONATE MY ORGANS -- IF I CAN COME OUT OF IT. OKAY. SO ANOTHER STRESSFUL MOMENT IN AFTER THE EMERGENCY THE AMBULANCE IT HAD GOT ME THERE -- DUE TO THE BRAKE FAILURE I SUFFERED A CONCUSSION. RATHER SERIOUS ONE EVEN THOUGH I HAD MY HELMET ON AND FASTENED. SOME POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS. ROAD RASH BURNS ON THE BACKS OF MY HANDS ON MY KNEES AND MY ELBOWS. EXPOSED TEN TENDONS IN MY LEFT HAND. AND THE REQUIRED STITCHES ON MY RIGHT ELBOW AND ALSO ON MY LEFT HAND. I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL FOR TWO AND A HALF DAYS AND STILL HAVE SOME RECURRING PAIN. MOSTLY IN THE FORM OF HEADACHES AND COGNITIVE ISSUES THESE SCOOTERS. MAY PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION OPTION. BUT THEY NEED TO BE WELL MAINTAINED. SO THAT RIDERS CAN BE SAFE IMAGINE. YOURSELF RENTING A CAR AND DRIVING DOWN HILL ONLY TO FIND THAT THE BRAKES WEREN'T WORKING. SO YOU PLOW INTO A CAR IN FRONT OF YOU OR TAKE A ONLY CHILD CROSSING THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL. THAT CAN ALSO WOULD WOULDN'T YOU GO AFTER THE THE MANUFACTURE THE AUTOMOBILE OR THE RENTA AGENCY. THE STATE HAS AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE SURE MINIMUM SAFETY AND IN. CHARGE PROTECTIONS ARE IN PLACE. AB TWELVE EIGHTY SIX DOES THIS AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE PREFERRED ON PAST PRESENT IN THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS VERY IMPORTANT -- NEW TECHNOLOGY TO BE EXAMINED WITHIN THIS COMMITTEE AND WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE. THIS HARKENS BACK A LITTLE BIT TO UBER AND LEFT WHEN THEY SUDDENLY. CLUSTER BOMB THE CITIES AND THEN WE WERE LEFT TO TRY TO REGULATE AND PROTECT CONSUMERS AFTERWARDS. THE EAST GOODERS ARE EVERYWHERE. AND CURRENTLY THEY HAVE NO INSURANCE THAT IS ON THEM SHOULD SOMEONE USING THE EAST GIRDER SCOOTER RUN INTO A BLIND PERSON. AUSTRIAN -- SOMEHOW INVOLVE THEMSELVES IN AN ACCIDENT WHERE SOMEONE IS HARMED. ADDITIONALLY THERE IS NO PROTECTION FOR PERSONS LIKE THE WITNESS THAT YOU JUST HEARD. SHOULD THEY HAVE A DEFECT IN THEM OR SHOULD THEY FAIL TO OPERATE APPROPRIATELY. IN MANY INSTANCES THEIR MAINTENANCE PROGRAM IS PAYING SOMEONE ELSE FIVE DOLLARS A NIGHT TO PICK THEM UP TAKE THEM HOME PLUG THE MAN IN CHARGE THEM. SO THERE ISN'T ANY TYPE OF MOTIVATION FOR THEM LEGALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR PRODUCTS ARE WELL MAINTAINED AND ARE SAFE FOR CONSUMERS. IN READING THE OPPOSITION I'VE SEEN WHERE THEIR CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT HOW THIS WILL STIFLE NEW TECHNOLOGY WELL THAT'S SOMETHING WE HEARD DURING THE UBER AND LIFT DISCUSSIONS AS WELL. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO HAS THE MOST RIGOROUS PROGRAM WHICH DOES REQUIRE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF INSURANCE ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY. IN THEY HAD NUMEROUS APPLICANTS TO RECEIVE TWO SLOTS THAT WERE AVAILABLE INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE NOW -- COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS LEGISLATION. SO THE ISSUE OF INSURANCE IS NOT GOING TO STYMIE THE INNOVATION OR THE PRESENCE OF THESE ITEMS ON THE STREET. ANOTHER GRAVE CONCERN IS WITHIN THESE CLICKING ACCEPT AGREEMENTS. ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK. AND I READ ONE OF THE OUR OPPONENTS SAYING THIS IS A FUN NEW ATHLETIC TYPE OF SPORT. AND ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK IS A LOT LIKE PLAYING IN FOOTBALL OR OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THE TYPE. WELL SIMILAR TO THE ANALOGY JUST MADE. IF YOU RENT A CONVERTIBLE IT MIGHT BE FUN WITH THE WIND BLOWING THROUGH YOUR HAIR AND YOU MAY ENJOY THE DRIVE. BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD ASSUME THE REST OF THAT CAR IS GOING TO LOSE ITS WHEELING YOU'RE GOING TO DRIVE OFF THE EDGE OF THE PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY. BECAUSE IT PROVIDES YOU WITH AN ENJOYABLE BENEFIT. THE OTHER THING IS A RELEASE AND WAIVER OF LIABILITY AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE THE MANUFACTURER WHO MAY MAKE A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT OF THE FALLS APART OR BRAKE FAILURE. SO THE TECHNOLOGY IS BENEFICIAL THE IDEA IS GOOD. IT MUST HOWEVER BE REGULATED TO PROTECT THE CONSUMERS IT CAN'T MERELY BE. A RELEASE ON TO THE STREET A COLLECTION OF REVENUE BUT NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE THE IMPACTS THAT THESE HAVE ON SOCIETY WITH THE PRODUCTS BECAUSE WHEN MOST PEOPLE GET INJURED IF THEY'RE PEDESTRIANS ARE AT CETERA. THAT FALLS UPON THE CITIES THE COUNTIES IN THE STATE TO PAY THEIR MEDICAL BILLS. SO THAT SHOULD BE REFLECTED WITHIN THE INSURANCE SO THAT IT CAN BE SPREAD AMONGST ALL OF THE USERS AT A FRACTION OF A PENNY PER RIDE. RATHER THAN PERHAPS HAVING -- MEDI CAL PICK UP A HALF MILLION DOLLAR BILL. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH ENCOURAGE THAT YOU OF BOTH THIS OUT AND I DO KNOW THAT WE ARE WORKING ACTIVELY WITH ALL OF THE CONCERNS STAKEHOLDERS TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION SORENSON TO MAKE GREAT PROGRESS. SO FAR AND I BELIEVE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO IF GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY BY THIS COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A ADDITIONAL SUPPORTERS. A GOOD AFTERNOON -- CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RUNNING VIDEO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CITIES -- FIRST WATCHED WANTED THANK -- THE AUTHOR THE SPONSORS -- AND THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH US ON ADDRESSING SOME OF THE ISSUES WE HAD WE WERE SUPPORTING CONCEPT. A BILL WITH THE OTHERS AGREEMENT -- TO EXCEPT A AMENDMENTS ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE ANALYSIS THAT WE ARE MOVING TO A FULL SUPPORT POSITION WE THINK THAT THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL ARE CONSISTENT WITH A LOT OF THE REQUIREMENTS READY. A REQUIRED BY CITIES COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- AND THEN IT ALSO RESEARCH OUR LOCAL AUTHORITY -- IN ENSURING THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO REGULATE THESE DEVICES AND ENSURE THE PROPER SAFETY SO -- WITH THAT -- WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU MATCH NEXT PLACE. RICHARD HOLBROOKE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU MATCH NEXT PLEASE. MR CHECKER CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE THE SCHOLARS POSE AN INCREDIBLE -- OBSTACLE COURSE FOR PERSONS WITH -- BOTH PHYSICAL AND SENSORY DISABILITIES IN TRYING TO MANEUVER AROUND THE STREETS AND IN FACT WE HAD TO RECENTLY FILE AN ADA CLAIMED AND CITY OF SAN DIEGO FOR THE VERY REASON THAT THEY DIDN'T STEP UP. TO REGULATE THE THESE SCOOTERS AND AND WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT IN EVERY JURISDICTION IN THIS BILL WILL HELP US WITH THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU MATCH. OF HIS ASIAN PLACE [inaudible] COMFORT. GET TO SEE ME ALL DAY TODAY -- SO MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CORY JOHNSON WITH TECH THAT -- WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR AT ACKNOWLEDGING SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WITH THE BILL AND WE STILL HAVE MAJOR CONCERNS -- SO MY CRIMINAL BILLY DEE SERVICES OFFER AND I'M MORE AFFORDABLE AND MORE CONVENIENT AND GREENER MODE OF TRANSPORTATION THAT IS AN OPTION -- TO REDUCE CAR AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION CONGESTION AND WE'RE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL THAT IT WELL I'M REALLY THREATEN THE DEPLOYMENT OF THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY SO GETTING INTO THE HEART OF THE BILL AND THE INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS WILL START THERE. THE BILL REQUIRES A STAGGERING MINIMUM OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS pTHAT WHICH IS FAR IN EXCESS OF WHAT CITIES AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY REQUIRE THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE IT INDUSTRY TO MAINTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE ON BEHALF OF THE USER WHICH IS APPLE CALL PEOPLE TO FIRST PARTY INJURIES AND THIRD PARTY NEGLIGENCE. THIS IS THE THE USER OR CONTACT ISSUE THAT THE AUTHOR IS TALKING ABOUT SO JUST AS AN EXAMPLE I TAKE A SCOOTER I RUN A SCOOTER -- I PICK IT UP AND HIT SOMEBODY OVER THE HEAD WITH IT THIS GOOD OUR COMPANY THAT IRAQ. RENTED THAT FROM WOULD BE LIABLE FOR MY CONDUCT AND THAT'S JUST YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT WERE NOT IN CONTROL OF THAT CONDUCT -- SHOULD WE BE HELD LIABLE FOR THAT -- THAT ACTUALLY MAKES IT SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE YOU KNOW NO INCENTIVE TO NOT DO BAD THINGS WHEN THEY'RE RENTING THE IS I'M DO WE REALLY WANT TO ALLOW THAT ARE. YOU KNOW PROVIDE INCENTIVES TO DO THAT DESPITE THE COMPARISONS MADE BY THE BILL'S SPONSOR AND REFLECT IN THE ANNOUNCED IT IS IT IS NOT ACCURATE SUGGEST THAT THE INDUSTRY IS REQUIRED IN ANY MARKET ANYWHERE TO MAINTAIN THIS TYPE OF INSURANCE -- WE AGREE THAT THERE SHOULD BE A REASONABLE UNIFORM STANDARD WHEN IT COMES TO INSURANCE -- BUT WE HAVE YOU KNOW WANT TO MAKE VERY CLEAR THAT THE WHAT'S CURRENTLY IN THE BILL AND IS NOT WORKABLE -- YOU KNOW THERE IS AN AB REFERENCE IN THE ANALYSIS THAT COULD BANKRUPT COMPANIES -- AND SO I APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AS WE MOVE FORWARD ON ON THIS BILL AND THE BILL ALSO PROPOSES REMOVING A COMPANIES RIGHT TO INCLUDE WAIVER RELEASE PROVISIONS IN THEIR USER AGREEMENTS WHICH ARE STANDARD CLAUSES DESIGNED TO PROTECT COMPANIES FROM LIABILITY. FOR INCIDENTS BECAUSE THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN THERE IS NO REASON WHY SHARED M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; BUILT&lt;/c&gt;</u> MICRA MOBILITY SHOULD BE SINGLED OUT AMONG INDUSTRIES IN CALIFORNIA FOR SUCH LIMITATIONS ON THEIR FREEDOM OF CONTRACT. FINALLY A LOCAL CONTROL -- SO THE BILL YOUR SERVICE LOCAL CONTROL BY PROHIBITING PILOTS ARE OFFERING THESE SERVICES TO BECAUSE CUSTOMERS BEFORE A DETAILED ORDINANCES ESTABLISHED. THIS RESTRICTION IS SIMPLY DOES NOT REFLECT THE APPROACH THAT SOME CALIFORNIA CITIES HAVE TAKEN AND MAY PREFER IT ALSO DOES NOT REFLECT THAT THERE ARE SOME BIG CITIES CAN THAT CAN YOU KNOW HAVE THE MANPOWER TO DO THESE ORDINANCES AND OTHERS MAY WANT TO DO A PILOT PROGRAM FIRST. AND YOU KNOW FIGURE IT OUT AND THEN MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE STAFF TO TAKE ON AN WHOLE ORDINANCE TO WORK THROUGH THAT PROCESS. AND SO WE BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL SEVERELY LIMIT ACCESS TO THIS NECK NEW TECHNOLOGY IN CALIFORNIA WOULD DENY CALIFORNIA FROM ADOPTING A RAIDER WAY TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS -- IT WOULD ROB A TRANSPORTATION OPTION FOR CALIFORNIANS AND A NICE CITIES -- THAT JOB AND GROWTH CREATING BENEFITS OF EXPANDING ACCESS TO TRANSIT SO WE ASK FOR KNOW ABOUT THANK YOU. OUR NEXT WITNESS IN OPPOSITION PLACE. HI SERRA BRUTE WITH CAL CHAMBER -- JUST TO CONFIRM WE'RE THANKFUL FOR THE AMENDMENTS ADDRESSING ARBITRATION AND WHEN THOSE ARE IN PRINT WE WILL BE REMOVING OUR JOB KILLER LABEL BUT FOR THE REASONS STATED BY -- MY COLLEAGUE FROM TECH THAT -- WE DO REMAIN OPPOSED TO THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. MY CLUB IS DIEM ON BEHALF OF UBER -- WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OFF AUTHORS EFFORTS. TO RESOLVE SOME OF OUR CONCERNS -- AND WILL FOR TO WORKING WITH HIM TO THE BILL BEFORE THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT PLACE. ALICIA PRIEGO ON BEHALF OF BIRD IN OPPOSITION AND ALIGN OUR I'M OPPOSITION WITH TECHNET BUT DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THAT AUTHOR ON CHANGES TO THE BILL. THANK YOU NEXT PLACE. GREY CAM ON THE OTHER LINE JUST ALIGN MYSELF WITH EVERYBODY ELSE OPPOSE THE BILL IN PRINT APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S ABILITY TO WORK WITH US AND HELPING TO WORK ON SOMETHING THE FUTURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MUCH OUR QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMUTE MISTER ON BERMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- THANK YOU EMERGENCY FOR BRING THIS BILL FOR IT I IF IF THIS BILL OR IN ITS FINAL FORM ON THE FLOOR I'D I'D DEFINITELY BE HARD NO VOTE -- BUT I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THAT YOU MADE IN YOUR INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS I THINK THAT THE SCENARIO THAT THE WITNESS LAID OUT IS IS A TERRIFYING -- ONE AND ONE THAT'S TOTALLY LEGITIMATE TO ADDRESS I THINK THIS BILL GOES WAY BEYOND THAT -- THE LIABILITY THE INSURANCE -- COMPONENTS THE THE LEVEL OF INSURANCE AND AND THE SCOPE A LIABILITY IN A THIRD PARTY LIABILITY I THINK IS IS PRETTY UNNECESSARY AND SO -- I'D REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO TO JERRY I KNOW THAT YOU WILL BECAUSE I KNOW YOU -- KEEP ON WORKING WITH -- THE FOLKS OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL. HAPPY TO SUPPORT TODAY BECAUSE I THINK -- BEEN PLEASED TO SEE THE MOVEMENT THAT'S OCCURRED -- YOU KNOW TODAY AND IN OF THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS BUT JUST REALLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP ON WORKING WITH FOLKS WHO HAVE CONCERNS BECAUSE I SHARE -- BUNCH THE CONCERNS THAT THEY'VE RAISED THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT IT JUST WORK REAL QUICKLY -- AS CHAIR THE FIVE MILLION DOLLAR LIABILITY FIGURE COMES FROM SAN FRANCISCO SAN FRANCISCO YES SO IT'S NOT UNPRECEDENTED SO BUT BUT YES WE ARE FULLY COMMITTED. TO TO HAVING THE CONVERSATIONS -- TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE STAKEHOLDER I I APPRECIATE THAT THE STAFF ANALYSIS SEEMS INDICATE THAT FIVE MILLION A SANTA MONICA AND LOS ANGELES IN THAT SAN FRANCISCO IS TWO MILLION PER OCCURRENCE WITH A FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AGGREGATE -- SO I JUST MAKE SURE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT -- THERE AND I NOW KNOW WHICH ONE IS RIGHT BUT YEAH I THINK THAT A LOT OF THE CITIES YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A RANGE. DON'T BE ON THE FAR END OF THE RANGE BECAUSE I WON'T BE ON THE FRONT OF THE RANGE. BRIDGET THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS THANK YOU MESS UP BAUER-KAHAN. THANK YOU I'M AND I JUST WANNA ECHO A COUPLE THINGS ALSO IN THE LIABILITY INSURANCE WE REQUIRE LESS THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ON A CAR AND LAST I CHECKED THE CAR CAN DO. SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE SAME SORT OF OUT OF SCOPE OF WHAT WE REQUIRE IN OTHER INDUSTRIES I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU WORK ON IT I WANT TO THANK YOU I MEAN CLEARLY YOU'RE WORKING HARD WITH THE OPPOSITION AND WITH OTHERS. TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE THIS BILL IS IN A BETTER PLACE I'M A LITTLE BIT PERPLEXED BY THIS DISCUSSION AROUND MY ABILITY BECAUSE AS I LISTEN TO THIS STORY -- I WOULD THINK NEGLIGENCE LAW WOULD APPLY THAT IF THE COMPANY WERE NEGLIGENT IN KEEPING UP THE SCOOTER AND SCOOTER DUE TO AS WHAT'S DESCRIBED THE COMPANY WOULD BE LIABLE UNDER NEGLIGENCE LAW AS A STAND THE CALIFORNIA. SO I'M CURIOUS WHY WE FEEL THERE'S A HOLE THERE THAT WE NEED TO FELL BUT NONE THE LESS I THINK AS LONG AS IT'S CLEAR. THAT IT'S YOU KNOW WHEN IT IS INCUMBENT UPON THE COMPANY'S RESPONSE IT WAS. IT WAS THE NEGLIGENCE OR COMPANY ENOUGH TO TO NEGLIGENCE THE USER THAT I'M COMFORTABLE BUT I YOU KNOW IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME WHY THAT'S NECESSARY MAYBE YOU HAVE AN ANSWER. YES I CAN CLARIFY THAT FOR YOU AS YOU HEARD A MOMENT AGO -- TECHNET AND THE OTHERS WANT TO HAVE A COMPLETE RELEASE AND WAIVER OF ALL LIABILITY FOR ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE SCOOTERS INCLUDING THEIR FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THEM. INCLUDING IF THE BATTERY THEY WANT TO AND THEY RELEASED THE MANUFACTURES IN THESE WAIVERS SO YES YOU'RE RIGHT IT WOULD BE NEGLIGENCE ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY EXCEPT THEY WANT TO EXEMPT THEMSELVES FROM NEGLIGENCE THROUGH THESE CLICKING ACCEPT AGREEMENTS. THAT IS AT THE HEART OF THIS BILL IS MAKING SURE THAT THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN. AS FAR AS PICKING UP A SCOOTER AND HITTING SOMEONE OVER THE HEAD WITH IT. THAT WOULD NOT LEAD TO LIABILITY OF THE COMPANY ANYMORE THAN IT WOULD BE IF SOMEONE OR PICK UP A PARK BENCH AND SLAMMING ON SOMEONE'S HEAD WOULD MAKE THE CITY LIABLE. BUT TO ADDRESS YOUR SPECIFIC CONCERNS. IF THEY'RE ALLOWED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE WAY THEY'RE OPERATING RIGHT NOW. THEN THEY WILL BE EXEMPT FROM LIABILITY IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND WITH THE PROVISIONS TO PREVENT THE WAIVERS. AND THE THE RELEASE IS THAT THEY WANT YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT NEGLIGENCE -- LIABILITY WILL TAKE CARE WHICH IS WHAT WE THINK SHOULD BE THE WAY IT GOES RIGHT SO I THAT'S WHAT I THINK YOU KNOW I ECHO MISTER BERMAN'S COMMENTS WITCHER. THAT NEGLIGENCE LAW SHOULD APPLY WHERE THE COMPANY'S NEGLIGENT AND THAT SHOULD BE WHERE IT STOPS AND WHERE WE HAVE A USER WHO IS USING IT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OR IN A WAY THAT. YOU KNOW IS NOT. FOR SIEBEL BY THE COMPANY THAT IT IS NOT THEIR NEGLIGENCE THAT BECAUSE THE END RESULT AND THEY SHOULD BE LIABLE AND I APPRECIATE YOU WORKING TO GET THERE AND ACCORDING THAT BILL ON THE FLOOR. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. SCOTT I'M GOING. JUST VERY BRIEFLY AT I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS WILLING TO WORK ON A COUPLE THINGS I'M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH A COUPLE THINGS. ON HIS BILL I MEAN. AND I I I YOU KNOW I HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT. SCOOTER JUST BEING ALL OVER THE PLACE -- AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AND AND ISSUES I SEE WITH THAT BUT IN TERMS OF LIABILITY I I DON'T NECESSARILY PERCEIVE THE COMPANIES WANTING TO BE NOT -- LIABLE FOR THINGS THAT THEY SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE. FOR THAT'S OUR JOB WE CAN MAKE THEM RESPONSIBLE FOR THINGS THAT THEY SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR BUT IT SHOULD ALL BE WITHIN REASON -- AND SO IT JUST AS LONG AS YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO FIND THAT BALANCE FIND. OUT WHAT THAT REASON IS -- I'M WILLING -- TO SUPPORT THE BILL UNDER THAT PREMISE TODAY -- BUT ON THE FLOOR IF YOU KNOW THE FINAL FORM OF THE BILL WILL DEPEND ON MY BUT WILL DEPEND ON THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU UP IF I MAY BRIEFLY -- MISTER CALDERON YOU RAISE THE ISSUE OF THE SCHOOL IS BEING LEFT ALL OF THE PLACE AND SO AS YOU HEARD FROM THE DISABILITY RIGHTS -- REPRESENTATIVE -- THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE MAIN GOALS OF REQUIRING THAT -- THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES ADOPT -- ROLES INCLUDING PARKING RULES SO THAT THEY'RE NOT JUST STREWN ON ON SIDEWALKS -- AND AND AND POSE A HAZARD FOR THE ELDERLY AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES RIGHT AND I ALSO WANT TO PRESERVE LOCAL CONTROL BECAUSE I THINK YOU SHOULD BE UP TO THE CITY BE OF THE RIGHT THERE ON RULES AND AND KIND OF HAVE THEIR OWN. DETERMINATION IN TERMS OF THE RULES AND WHAT WORKS FOR THEM AND WHAT DOESN'T YES AND AND I THINK THE FACT THAT THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES A SUPPORT IN THIS BILL AND CONCEPT -- SHOWS THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO LOCAL CONTROL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH UP. OUR I'M GLAD THAT THE AUTHOR HAS ACTUALLY -- LAID OUT SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE AT THE IT COULD GO SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT BEEN RAISED -- IN FACT UP THE COMMITTEE ALSO HAS SOME SIMILAR CONCERNS. AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE PROPOSE SIR SEVERAL AMENDMENTS I THINK SOME OF THE JIM EVANS ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES BUT NOT ALL OBVIOUSLY -- SO -- GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE BILL'S GOING TO THE NEXT TOP IS GONNA BE JUDICIARY WHERE WILL BE SOME OF US WILL BE LOOKING AT THE BILL AGAIN. ALL ON AT LEAST SO WITH RESPECT TO THE LIABILITY ISSUE I THINK I'M I'M COMFORTABLE MOVING AT FORT. I AM TOO WITH THAT IF I DON'T SEE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO CLOSE -- THE AND AFTER THAT THEN WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION -- TO MOVE THE BILL. I JUST THOUGHT FIND A COMMON YOU KNOW AS AN ENVIRONMENTALIST AYE AYES I STRONGLY SUPPORT THE SUCCESS. OF OF THESE PRODUCTS IN THE SERVICES I MEAN THIS IS PROVIDING A CRITICAL YOU KNOW -- FIRST AND LAST MILE TRANSPORTATION SOLUTION -- TO TO ADDRESS OUR OUR STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES AND SO YOU KNOW I WANT TO SEE THIS INDUSTRY SUCCEED I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IS SUCCEEDS. IN A SAFE. I ASKED FOR AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DO I HAVE A MOTION. TO HAVE A SECOND THE BILL IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CHECK OUT HI SO I KILEY BAR QUE HAN. BAUER-KAHAN HI BERMAN. BERMAN HI CALDERON. CALDERON HI GABRIEL [inaudible] GALLAGHER [inaudible] GALLAGHER NO [inaudible] IRWIN. OBERNOLTE. OBERNOLTE NO SMITH. SMITH I WICKS. WICKS SEC THE BILL HAS SIX VOTES SO IT IS OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ON THAT BRINGS US TO OUR FINAL ITEM. OF THE DAY AND THAT IS SO ITEM TWENTY ONE A. B. THIRTEEN SIXTEEN THAT SEMESTER GALLAGHER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE MISTER GALLAGHER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I HAVE NO WITNESSES AND I'M GONNA TRY AND MAKE THIS IS AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE BUT I DON'T THIS IS IMPORTANT BILL OTHERS SAY THE BEST FOR LAST OF COURSE -- SO -- PROUD TO PRESENT AB THIRTEEN SIXTEEN AND I WANT TO START -- JUST BY OUTLINING THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LOT OF THE LAST FEW YEARS ABOUT HOW POLARIZED. OUR SOCIETY IS BECOMING YOU KNOW IN AMERICA AN INTER INTER OUR POLITICS. YOUR MORE MORE WE ARE ISOLATING OURSELVES ONLY HEARING. NO ONE VIEWPOINT PUTTING OURSELVES OUR OWN ECHO CHAMBERS -- AND WE'VE SEEN THAT THIS IS BEEN EXACERBATED BY SOCIAL MEDIA WITH. WITH THE ALGORITHMS -- THAT WERE BASICALLY TARGETED TO ONLY GIVE YOU NEWS THAT. THEY THAT THEY THINK THAT YOU WOULD LIKE. AND THAT HAS LED TO MORE MORE PEOPLE ONLY GETTING A CERTAIN TYPE OF YOU POINT A CERTAIN TYPE OF NEWS THAT AGREES WITH. WHAT THEIR WORLD VIEW WHAT THEIR OPINION IS -- AND WE SAW I THINK YOU'RE MORE RECENTLY -- WITH THE MOLAR REPORT [inaudible] THAT. THE RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE THAT THAT OCCURRED BY THIS GROUP THE IRA -- THEY ACTUALLY. MADE FAKE ACCOUNTS. TARGETED TOWARDS DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE -- AND THEY AND THEY RELEASE FAKE INFORMATION BASICALLY. WITH THE WITH THE GOAL OF AN CITING. THOSE GROUPS. TO TO ACTION INTO EVEN THOUGH THE INFORMATION IT CONTAINED IN THOSE CONTAINING THOSE THINGS WASN'T TRUE. AND WE'VE MADE OURSELVES. SORT OF EASY TARGETS BY THIS BY THIS POLARIZATION AND BY WHAT HAS HAPPENED ON SOCIAL MEDIA -- I ALSO JUST FROM MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. I'VE REALIZED. THAT IN MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE. I'VE BEEN SURROUNDED BY LIBERALS. YEAH I WAS OUT AS YOU KNOW I GREW UP IN A VERY RURAL AREA -- BUT WENT TO UC BERKELEY YOU KNOW FOR FOR MY UNDERGRAD I WAS I WAS CERTAINLY IN THE MINORITY. YOU IN THAT PLACE IN TERMS OF OF MY OF MY VIEW POINT. AND THEN I WENT ON YOU KNOW TO ACTUALLY SERVE HERE AS A FELLOW -- AND THEN ULTIMATELY CAME TO THIS PLACE YOU KNOW TO THIS CAPITAL WHERE AGAIN YOU KNOW I HAVE BENEFITTED I THINK FROM BEING ABLE TO HEAR. THE OTHER SIDE OF OF OF VIEWPOINTS HERE MULTIPLE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES -- AND SO IN IN MY OWN LIFE IN EVEN THOUGH IT DIDN'T WORK YOU GUYS DIDN'T CONVERT ME -- I HAVE. I WOULD SAY THAT [inaudible] YOU KNOW. AND I THINK THAT ALL OF YOU CAN APPRECIATE THIS -- TO BECAUSE IT WORKS BOTH WAYS YOU GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM WHAT THEIR PERSPECTIVES ARE. EVEN IF YOU DON'T ULTIMATELY AGREE ON A POINT -- YOU BECOME MUCH MORE WELL ROUNDED MUCH MORE INFORMED -- AND MUCH BETTER TO BE ABLE TO RELATE IN A CIVIL SOCIETY -- AND SO I THINK THE ANSWER TO SOME OF THIS POLARIZATION IS REALLY TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS MORE SPEECH AND THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF CENSORSHIP THAT HAS BEEN. THAT HAS BEEN OCCURRING -- I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THESE PLATFORMS FACEBOOK AND TWITTER. HAVE BECOME. PLACES WHERE WE'RE HAVING DISCUSSIONS OF MAJOR PUBLIC CONCERN. THERE PLACES WHERE WE'RE HAVING AN ELECTION PERIOD. WHERE A LOT OF YOU KNOW CAMPAIGNS ARE WON AND LOST ON INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE PUTTING OUT ON ON THESE PLATFORMS? AND THIS IS WHERE WE GET NEWS NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE GET THEIR NEWS JUST BY LOOKING AT THEIR TWITTER FEED -- SO IN THAT CASE HOW THOSE PLATFORMS ARE MANAGED AND WHO DOES THE MANAGING MATTERS -- AND I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW. THIS DOES HAVE TO BE CAREFUL AND WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THIS BUT I THINK THE ANALYSIS WHICH THE ANALYSIS I THINK WAS GREAT ON THIS. MR Là ME. YOU KNOW I THINK COVERED ALL THE ISSUES BUT HERE'S WHAT I THINK IT REALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS THIS IS THE MAJOR POINT. IS IT THIS BILL ACKNOWLEDGES AND THIS IS ON PAGE SEVEN THIS BILL ACKNOWLEDGES THE STRONG PUBLIC POLICY ARGUMENT. THAT SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITE SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO EXERCISE THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. TO NOT ALLOW CERTAIN SPEECH ON THEIR PLATFORMS. WHILE STILL SEEKING TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT CONTENT REGULATION WILL BE BASED ON POLITICAL POLITICAL IDEOLOGY. IT STRIKES THAT BALANCE UNDER THIS BILL. THOSE PLATFORMS WILL STILL BE ABLE TO TAKE OFF ANY SPEECH THAT IS INCITEMENT TO VIOLENCE IT'S OBSCENITY THAT HATE SPEECH. AND THEY CAN ALSO REMOVE ANY. YOUR POSTS OR TWEETS THAT WOULD BE INCONSISTENT. WITH THEIR TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT THEY'VE OUTLINED AS HEY THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD WE WOULD ACCEPT ON OUR SITES -- AND IT MAKES THAT VERY CLEAR. AND SO LOOK I THINK THAT THIS STRIKES THE BOUNCE NOW SOME. THE LEGAL ARGUMENT THAT COMES IN HERE IS A THESE SITES ARE PRIVATE. THEY'RE NOT LIKE GOVERNMENT -- AND THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS CONCERNED WITH GOVERNMENT THAT'S TRUE. BUT RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE WERE THE FIRST THE CALIFORNIA STATE SUPREME COURT. WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT PRIVATE PROPERTY PRIVATE PLATFORMS CAN BECOME LIMITED PUBLIC FORMS. AND THAT'S OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS AS WELL AS THE THE PRUNE YARD -- SHOPPING MALL CASE. IN WHICH THE COURT FOUND THAT PEOPLE THAT WERE. HANDING OUT FLYERS INFORMATION IN A PRIVATE SHOPPING MALL -- AS WERE IN FACT LET AND THEY COULDN'T BAR THEM FROM DOING SO THEY CAN BUY THEM FROM HANDING OUT THESE FLYERS. BECAUSE IT HAD BECOME A LIMITED PUBLIC FORUM IN THE COURT SAID. THAT IN RELEVANT PART. THIS BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENT THAT HAS. HAS SET ITSELF OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. AND ALLOWED PEOPLE TO COME AND GO AS THEY PLEASE THE VIEWS EXPRESSED BY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN PASSING OUT THE PAMPHLETS OR SEEKING SIGNATURES MAKING POSTS -- FOR A FOR A PETITION ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE IDENTIFIED WITH THE SHOPPING MALL THEY'RE GOING TO BE IDENTIFIED WITH THE PERSON MAKING THAT. MAKING THAT STATEMENT SO TO ON FACEBOOK AND TWITTER WE'RE NOT US YOU KNOW. WHEN SOMEONE MAKES A POST WHEN? WHEN WE GO ON AS WE DO OFTEN DO MANY OF US OUT THESE ACCOUNTS WE MAKE A STATEMENT ABOUT OUR BELIEFS -- BILLS THAT WERE WORKING ON THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT'S A STATEMENT FROM US IT'S NOT A STATEMENT FROM FACEBOOK. IT'S NOT A STATEMENT FROM TWITTER. AND SO I THINK THAT THIS THIS FITS RIGHT INTO THAT MOULD OF CALIFORNIA LAW THAT WAS ESTABLISHED. SPEAKING OF SEVERAL DECADES AGO ACTUALLY -- AND AND I THINK IT RECOGNIZES THAT LOOK WE DO NEED TO DO MORE TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS MORE SPEECH. THAT THERE IS THAT THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING MULTIPLE VIEWPOINTS AND ARE NOT GETTING INTO THESE ISOLATED BUBBLES WHERE WE ARE VULNERABLE. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE VULNERABLE TO THESE TYPE OF OF ATTACKS THAT WE'VE SEEN. I THINK THIS IS ONE ANSWER TO IT THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT WE PROBABLY NEED TO DO AS WELL -- BUT WE CAN'T HAVE CENSORSHIP AND I THINK THIS AGAIN THIS STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE PRESERVING. PEOPLE'S RIGHTS TO TAKE DOWN SPEECH OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT CONSISTENT WITH THEIR TERMS AND CONDITIONS -- THAT'S NOT CONSISTENT WITH OBVIOUSLY VALUES OBSCENE ALL OF THAT -- BUT THEN ALSO SAYS WE'RE NOT GONNA BAR PEOPLE JUST BASED ON THERE POLITICALVIEW POINTS -- SO I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS ON THIS LEGISLATION WE WORKED ON IT SINCE LAST YEAR AND MADE IT A BETTER BILL -- AND I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS -- THE ANALYSIS WOULD AGREE WITH THAT AND SO I'D ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU MATCHA OUR SUPPORTERS OPPOSITION. GOOD EVENING CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KEVIN KELLY I'M THE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR FAIRS FOR INTERNET ASSOCIATION. THE INTERNET HAS BECOME WHAT IT IS TODAY THANKS TO THE FACT THAT IT'S FREE OPEN ACCEPTING OF YOU POINTS. AND AFFILIATIONS FROM PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD. PEOPLE FROM EVERY POLITICAL WALK OF LIFE CONFINED COMMUNITIES IN CONTENT THAT INTEREST THEM AN INTERNET PLATFORMS ENABLE EVERYONE TO LEARN ABOUT SHARE AND DEBATE DIVERSITY OF VIEWS AND OPINIONS. AND ALREADY SOME TOPICS AROUND THE WORLD. WITH THIS GOAL WE DO SHARE A SIMILAR NUMBER GALLAGHER IS GOAL. HOWEVER HIS BILLS THIS BILL IS BASED ON A FLAWED PREMISE THE MODERATION DECISIONS ARE BASED ON POLITICAL VIEWPOINT. ONLINE PLATFORMS AND FORCE THE COMMUNITY STANDARDS WHICH ALLOWS USERS TO FEEL SAFE SECURE BOTH ONLINE AND OFF. THIS REQUIRES REMOVING CONTENT THE POSES A THREAT OF HARM. TO THE PUBLIC AND PERSONAL SAFETY OR CONTENT FOR PROMOTING HATRED OF VIOLENCE AGAINST CERTAIN GROUPS [inaudible] ALLEGATIONS THAT PLATFORMS ENGAGE IN PRACTICES LIKE SHADOW BANNING AGAINST CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATORS ARE UNFOUNDED. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS BILL IN PIZZA PLATFORMS ABILITY TO MODERATE TROLLS SPREADING MISINFORMATION LIKE THE IRA ACCOUNTS THAT SOMEONE NUMBER GALLAGHER IDENTIFIED. WAR FROM REMOVING VIDEOS CLAIMING THAT SANDY HOOK. TRAGEDY WAS A HOAX IT IS UNACCEPTABLE. THE ANSWER TO NEEDING MORE SPEECH IS NOT THIS TYPE OF SPEECH THIS BILL IMPEDES THE PLATFORMS ABILITY TO MODERATE THEIR PLATFORMS. THE PLATFORMS UNDER CALLS TODAY TO DO MORE MODERATION TO DO A BETTER WE ARE LEARNING. AND THIS BILL WORKS AGAINST THAT. IN A FOUNDATIONAL LEVELS ALSO OFTEN VERY DIFFICULT TO DEFINE WHAT IS POLITICAL. NOT ALL PEOPLE FIND THE SAME ISSUES TO BE POLITICAL. SO FRAMING THINGS AS POLITICAL OR NOT ON A CASE BY CASE POST BY POST BASIS IS ONYX UNWORKABLE - AND IS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT ONE PERSON'S POLITICAL SPEECH IS ANOTHER PERSON'S INCITEMENT. PEOPLE USE THESE PLATFORMS BECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE TO FIND CONTENT THEY LIKE SOME USERS ONE PARTICULAR CONTENT SOME USERS AS THE PLATFORMS NOT TO SHOW THEM CONTENT THEY FIND OBJECTIONABLE. THIS BILL WOULD UNDERMINE THE PLATFORMS TOOLS TO SERVE THEIR USERS. FINALLY IT'S NOT CLEAR WITH THIS BILL REQUIRED TO THE EXTENT THAT ENVISIONS PLATFORMS LISTING OUT TYPES OF POLITICAL SPEECH IS ACCEPTABLE ACCEPTABLE OR UNACCEPTABLE BE HOLY AND HELPFUL TO HELP THE PUBLIC DISCOURSE. IF IT'S SUGGESTING THE CON THE PLATFORMS CAN ONLY MODERATE CONTENT THAT VIOLATES EXISTING TERMS OF SERVICE AND THAT'S UNNECESSARY DUPLICATIVE AND WILL HIGHLIGHT -- COMPLETELY ERRONEOUS REASONS THE CONTENT IS MODERATED. SO WE THINK THAT THIS BILL CONFUSES USERS UNNECESSARILY THE TEARS FROM CLEAR CONTENT OPERATION STANDARDS AND IMPEDES IN THAT MODERATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. AS CHAIR AND MEMBERS ACCORDING JENSEN THE TECHNION OPPOSITION. THANK YOU RELATIONAL SEEMED AND NONE. BACK TO COMMITTEE MISTER CALDERON GO AHEAD YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SO WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS BILL AND AND I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR HEAD AS ADAM AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. IT MY CONCERN WHICH I SAID I SURE DO YOU HAVE A COUPLE CONCERNS THE ONE CONCERN I HAVE IS -- WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET TO WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET OUT AND THAT THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT. I MEAN IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THT THE BETTER FOCUS WOULD BE ON THE ALGORITHMS THAT PLATFORMS USE NOT NECESSARILY. SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS BUT YOU KNOW GOOGLE SEARCHES ANOTHER SEARCH ENGINE PLATFORMS THAT OP -- IMPLEMENT ALGORITHMS -- THAT -- FOCUS MORE ON WHAT WE WHAT WE PUT INTO THAT THAT THE SEARCH BARS AND THEN THEY CONTINUE TO SHOW US INFORMATION THAT THEY THINK WE WANT TO SEE RATHER THAN MORE. UNFILTERED INFORMATION -- SO THAT WE ARE WORLD VIEW IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE SEARCH SEARCHING ON ON A SEARCH ENGINE IS MORE FOCUSED BASED ON WHAT THEY THINK WE WANT TO SEE OR WANT TO READ -- AS OPPOSED TO WHAT WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO WHICH IS EVERYTHING IN MULTIPLE DIFFERENT PLATFORMS OR MULTIPLE DIFFERENT -- PERSPECTIVES -- I I JUST YOU KNOW WHAT MY I HAVE A BIG CONCERN OF WHETHER OR NOT. HE WE ARE. PROVIDING AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO ALLOW HATE SPEECH WHICH ISN'T ALWAYS. SPEECH THAT IS OVER AT AND AND THERE'S A THERE'S A WAY TO SPEAK -- OR TO USE HATE SPEECH WITHOUT IT NECESSARILY SOUNDING VARIANCE IN THE AREA ARE LIKE YOU ARE USING HATE SPEECH AND PROVIDING PROTECTION UNDER THIS LAW AND UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW -- FOR THAT TYPE OF SPEECH OR PROVIDING POTENTIAL PROTECTION FOR SOMEBODY THAT'S TRYING TO INFLUENCE AN ELECTION INS INFO INFLUENCE A CIVIL DISCOURSE OF ALL OF OF OUR STATE. OUR BY PROTECTING CERTAIN KIND OF SPEECH BECAUSE I'M SAYING IT'S POLITICAL SPEECH OF THAT'S MY POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE THAT'S POLITICAL SPEECH AND THEN IS PROTECTED IN. AND THEN THAT BECOMES AN INTERESTING QUESTION AT THAT GOES TO COURT ABOUT HOW YOU DIFFERENTIATE YOU KNOW. IS THIS POLITICAL SPEAKERS IS NOT POLITICAL SPEECH FOR SUCH GREAT AT THAT QUITE A JUDGMENT THAT AN INTERNET COMPANY OR SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES CAN HAVE TO MAKE ON THE ROUND OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS A POLITICAL SPEECH OR NOT POLITICAL SPEECH. AND THEN I COULD JUST SEE THIS COMING BACK -- TO IF THIS EVER WENT TO COURT COMING BACK TO THE LEAD IN THE COURT SAYING YOU GOT TO GO BACK TO LEGISLATION THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO MORE CLEARLY DEFINE WHAT THIS ACTUALLY MEANS -- BECAUSE AS NOTED IN YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE AND THE ANALYSIS POLITICAL SPEECH AND HATE SPEECH OR ARE IN THE EYE OF THE OF THE BEHOLDER A LOT OF TIME SO. I DO HAVE. THOSE TYPES OF CONCERNS BUT THEN ALSO I KEEP FALLING BACK ON IS IS THIS REALLY A PROBLEM -- AND IS THERE A PROBLEM THAT REALLY WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE ACTUAL PROBLEM THAT REALLY TRYING TO SOLVE IN IS IS REALLY BASED ON ANY ACTUAL. A REALITY I MEAN SH THAT YOU SHORE WE'VE SEEN A COUPLE MORE HIGH PROFILE FOLKS THAT ARE ON TWITTER -- THAT SAY CERTAIN THINGS AND AND AND IT SEEMS LIKE THE PERSPECTIVE IS OKAY THEIR MORE CONSERVATIVE I AND SO. YOU KNOW YOU'RE A LIBERAL PLATFORM YOU KNOW WHO YOUR OF YOUR FOUNDER ADMITTED YOUR LIBERAL WHERE YOU ADMITTED THAT MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE EMPLOYEES OF YOUR COMPANY TEND TO BE LIBERAL AND THE AND HERE YOU ARE HERE THREE EXAMPLES OF OF PEOPLE THAT WERE BANNED BECAUSE YOU'RE CONSERVATIVE -- AND AND AND THE AND THE IDEA THE THE WHO WHO WERE BANNED FOR POLITICAL VIEWS AND IN THE IDEAS THAT THE BEING BANNED BECAUSE A CONSERVATIVE. AND NOT -- WHAT WOULD THE COMPANIES ARE DESCRIBING SAYING BECAUSE IT IT DOESN'T HELP A COMPANY TO BE BANNING REALLY ANYBODY FOR ANYTHING -- BUT THE COMPANIES ARE SIGNALED FOR THE SPECIFIC REASONS THEY VIOLATED OUR TERMS AND USE AND WE DON'T REALLY KNOW. YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE THOSE ARE MY HOPE HIGH PROFILE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE BEING BANNED THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT COME TO MIND SEEM pPLATFORM IS BEATING UP ON A CONSERVATIVE -- THE INDIVIDUAL THAT'S THAT IS EXERCISING HIS POLITICAL SPEECH ON A PLATFORM BUT YOU ALSO DON'T KNOW ALL THE ALL OF THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ONLINE THAT HAVE TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY FOLLOWS GENERALLY THE PEOPLE SENDING US HATE MAIL -- ONE FOLLOWER TO FOLLOWERS -- AND HOW MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE BEING BANNED WHAT THEIR POLITICAL BANTUS SO IT MAY SEEM BASED ON WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE NEWS THAT IT TENDS TO BE MORE CONSERVATIVE BUT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN IT'S REPRESENTATIVE. OF THE ACTUAL PLATFORM BANNING PEOPLE THAT ARE MORE CONSERVATIVE VERSUS PEOPLE THEY'RE NOT -- CONSERVATIVE OR COULD YOU KNOW THERE COULD BE AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF NOT MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THE LIBERAL SIDE OF THE PART OF THE SPECTRUM THERE ALSO BEING BANNED BUT WE JUST DON'T HEAR ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE NEWS DOESN'T CARE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT JACOB WALL. SO -- YOU KNOW. THOSE WOULD BE MY CONCERNS IS TRYING TO GET OUT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET OUT IN. IF THAT'S REALLY POSSIBLE TO DO I A I A I THINK THAT. POLITICAL SPEECH ARE WHEN DONE IN IN THAT IN THAT ON IT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE KNOW THAT MEANS IS SHOULD BE. YOU KNOW SHOULD BE SEEN AS THAT AND SHOULDN'T BE DIFFERENTIATED WHETHER IT'S A CONSERVATIVE YOU ARE LIBERAL VIEW -- BUT I JUST I'M CONCERNED ABOUT BASED ON THE ROLE SOCIAL MEDIA HAS PLAYED IN THE SPEECH ENDS UP ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND HOW IT INFLUENCE. INFLUENCE A CIVIL DISCOURSE IN OUR SOCIETY HOW IT INFLUENCES OUR POLITICS -- THAT THESE PLATFORMS THE TO BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THEIR ABILITY TO TO REMOVE THINGS -- THAT ARE EITHER OVER OR NOT OVER -- IN IN A IN THIS. MAKES THAT MORE COMPLICATED IN MY PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU CHARGE A PLATFORM OF BEING ABLE TO DECIDE? YOU KNOW IF SOMETHING IS HATE SPEECH UP OR POLITICAL SPEECH WHEN IT'S NOT RIGHT IN YOUR FACE -- SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE BUT AGAIN I THIS IS A TOUGH ISSUE TO TAKE ON SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU CAN TAKE THIS ON AN IMMUNOLOGIST OBVIOUSLY SOME FROM HARD YOU'RE DOING WITHOUT ANY SUPPORT. AND AND GENERALLY WHEN I DON'T HAVE SUPPORT ON BILLS IS BECAUSE IT THERE WAS MY IDEA. YOU KNOW. IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT GOOD IT'S A GOOD IDEA JUST MEANS I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT CLEARLY CARES. SO -- YOU KNOW I I I I I I I THINK THAT -- WHAT YOU'RE DOING IT IS A COMPLIMENT WHAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS -- IT IS COMMENDABLE I I JUST I I WORRY ABOUT BEING ABLE TO GET THERE AND IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO WITH IN STATE LAW AND THEN IT GOES INTO WHETHER OR NOT THERE SHOULD BE. A REALLY STATE LAW OR FEDERAL LAW AND YOU KNOW HOW THE AND YOU KNOW WHO SHOULD BE DOING THIS AND I WISH I FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MORE EFFECTIVE AND AND REGULATING THINGS BUT JUST RIGHT NOW IT'S MORE FOCUSED ON THINK ANYTHING DONE SO I I APPRECIATE WERE COMING FROM AND I JUST. WANNA BE ABLE TO EXPRESS A COUPLE CONCERNS THAT I'VE HAD. THANK YOU MUCH MISTER BERMAN. WELL JUST THE THE ECONOMIC ALWAYS COMMENTS ARE REALLY WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE ON THIS LAST YEAR THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD ON THIS THIS YEAR -- THE GOVERNMENT DO WITH A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ON A LOT OF THINGS AND I ALWAYS LIKE -- I TRIED REALLY HARD TO TAKE TO GET TO A PLACE TO SUPPORT THIS I DON'T THINK I'M THERE -- A AND IT'S IT'S ECONOMY AS MISTER CALDERON ALLUDED TO IT'S A LITTLE BIT A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS AND IT'S NOT WITHIN SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES OR ANY COMPANIES BEST -- KIND OF STRATEGY. TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ANY POLITICAL PARTY ESPECIALLY IN A COUNTRY WHERE WE ARE SO DIVIDED AND DO YOU KNOW IF YOU DO THAT YOU'RE GOING TO PISS OFF A LOT OF CUSTOMERS AND AND THAT DOESN'T SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S INTENTIONALLY HAPPENING -- AND THEY SAID THAT WOULD BE THE COSTS ARE THAT WOULD BE THE BENEFIT THE COST. AS CHAIR OF THE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE AND AND HAVING AUTHORED BILLS AROUND THIS ISSUE I REALLY DO WORRY ABOUT. THE FACT THAT THIS MIGHT CAUSE COMPANIES TO PAUSE. IN REMOVING CONTENT FROM THEIR PLATFORMS THERE REALLY IS A HARM TO THE PUBLIC WHETHER IT'S ARMED OUR DEMOCRACY OR WHETHER IT'S A THE HARMED OUR PUBLIC SAFETY IN TERMS OF OF YES AND SURROUND VACCINATIONS ARE OPPOSING VACCINATIONS A YOU KNOW. THERE'S A LOT OF WE KNOW AS YOU ALLUDED TO THAT THESE PLATFORMS CAN BE WEAPONIZED FOR BAD -- AND I THINK WE NEED TO GIVE THESE PLATFORMS MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY TO TO TRY -- TO DEBT PUSH BACK AGAINST THAT AND I WORRY THAT THIS BILL WILL HARM THEIR ABILITY TO DO THAT AND THAT'S A HUGE HALL -- IT'S A HUGE COST IN MY MIND AND SO AND SO THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS JUST DOESN'T WAY OUT BUT I TOTALLY APPRECIATE I AGREE WITH. THE FACT THAT WE ARE TO POLARIZE I THINK THAT I DO HAVE BIG CONCERNS AROUND THE ALGORITHMS THAT ARE USED BY THESE COMPANIES THAT CREATE THESE ECHO CHAMBERS YOU KNOW -- MAKE THINGS THAT MUCH WORSE -- AND YEAH REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERNS FOR THIS ISSUE -- AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON MORE ISSUES. THANK YOU ON THE SPOT OKAY AND YEAH I AM I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS I I ABSOLUTE GRIEVING BEING IN THIS BODY FOR JUST A FEW MONTHS I KNOW I'M BETTER FOR THE DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT THAT IS SHARED AMONG STATUS -- YOU INCLUDED AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ASPECT BUT I ALSO AM CONCERNED WITH. I ACTUALLY LOVE THE BREVITY AND CLARITY OF THE LAWS THE BRINGING FORWARD BUT THE BUT THE BREVITY OF THIS ONE DOES GIVE ME PAUSE BECAUSE I DO HEAR THE OPPOSITION'S. PROBLEMS AND I THINK THERE ARE THESE CONCERNS WITH. HOW WILL THEY DEAL WITH THE THINGS THAT I THINK HOPEFULLY WE ALL AGREE ARE HARMFUL TO POLITICAL DISCOURSE AND TO FERRET FREE ELECTIONS AND SO TAKING THAT FREEDOM AWAY FROM THEM? IS NOT BENEFICIAL ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT THERE'S NOT A PROBLEM BEFORE US THAT. APPEARS TO BE NEED TO BE CORRECTED BUT I DO THINK I MEAN PER YARD WITH WHAT I THOUGHT OF WHEN I READ THIS -- I THINK THAT THE COURTS WILL THEY FIND THAT THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ARE LIMITED PUBLIC FOR AT SOME POINT. I THINK IT'S OUT THERE I DON'T THINK THAT'S A CLEAR ANSWER BUT I GET BELIEVE THAT'S BEST IN THE HANDS OF THE JUDICIARY WHO WILL DO A VERY. SOPHISTICATED ANALYSIS ON THE THINGS YOU MENTIONED WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE FOR AND THAT. SHOULD BE -- AB THOSE FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTIONS ARE APPLICABLE TO AND THEN. GOING FOR WHAT THAT MEANS SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHAMUS KILEY. SO I WAS THAT A LITTLE SKEPTICAL AND THIS IDEA WAS BROUGHT LAST YEAR BUT I THINK THAT -- IN I IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN THERE ARE A COUPLE CHANGES THIS YEAR THAT -- pI THINK OUR OUR BIG IMPROVEMENTS TO MAKE THE BILL MORE WORKABLE WHERE IT SAYS THAT -- YOU ACTUALLY ARE ALLOWED -- TO FILTER CONTENT ON THE BASIS OF POLITICS OR ANYTHING ELSE ALONG WITH THAT'S DISCLOSED IN YOUR TERMS OF USE AND SO YOU CAN HAVE A WEBSITE THAT CATERS TO A PARTICULAR POINT OF VIEW AND DOESN'T LIKE. HAVING ANYTHING ELSE THERE AND THAT'S FINE YOU JUST GOT TO BE UP FRONT ABOUT IT -- AND ALL RAISES A SECOND WHAT A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT OF THE SOME OF THE OTHER COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE -- IS. IT'S NOT LIKE WE WOULD HAVE TO CUT SOME STANDARDS OUT OF WHOLE CLOTH IN DETERMINING. NGUYEN -- CONTENT IS BEING CENSORED ON THE BASIS OF POLITICAL AFFILIATION -- THERE'S A WELL ESTABLISHED MY MISS THE AUTHOR'S PRESENTATION BUT OVER THIS BUT THERE'S WELL ESTABLISHED CASE LAW AROUND FIRST AMENDMENT JURISPRUDENCE FOR LIMITED PUBLIC FORUMS WHEN YOU CAN -- DETERMINE WHETHER YOU'RE SHUTTING SOMEONE DOWN IN THE MALL ON THE BASIS THAT POLITICS OR ON A LEGITIMATE BASIS LIKE THEY'RE CREATING A DISTURBANCE OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES SO I THINK THAT -- THE BILL AS PRESENTED NOT PRESENTED NOW REPRESENTS A A PRETTY THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO WHAT I'VE YOU AS AS A REAL PROBLEM WHEN YOU HAVE. A FORUM THAT HOLDS ITSELF OUT AS A PUBLIC FORUM BUT UNBEKNOWNST TO THE USERS -- IS -- IS CAUSING SOME CONTENT NOT TO BE SEEN I THINK THAT'S REALLY PROBLEMATIC AND I THINK THE AUTHORS DONE A GOOD JOB TO ADDRESSES SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL EVEN THOUGH I DON'T BELIEVE I SUPPORT IT LAST YEAR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN LIKEWISE I DON'T THINK I SUPPORT THIS BILL LAST YEAR EITHER. BUT YOU'VE ADDED SOMETHING I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT WHICH IS THAT SENSE THAT SAYS. THE SHALL NOT REMOVE OR MANIPULATE CONTENT EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY. THE SOCIAL MEDIAS TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE SITE A QUESTION FOR THE OPPOSITION. WHICH IS THAT WITH THAT PROVISION IN THERE I MEAN IF THE CONTENTION IS -- WE NEED TO STILL BE ABLE TO REMOVE HATE SPEECH SURE WE STILL NEED TO BE ABLE TO MOVE. REMOVE -- THINGS THAT THAT WE THINK ARE ACCURATE -- WHAT IF YOU JUST SAY THAT WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO DO THOSE THINGS IN YOUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS WHY DOES THAT? NOT GIVE YOU THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT WHY WOULD YOU HAVE A CONCERN WITH THE BILL. I THINK IT'S GONNA PART GIVE -- HESITATION. TO THE PLATFORMS ARE SEEKING A MODERATE THAT TYPE OF CONTENT WHEN IT'S SOME. USERS VIEWED AS AND POLITICAL TERMS AND IT TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS BILLS. ASKING PLATFORMS TO LIST OUT VARIOUS TYPES OF POLITICAL FLAVORS OF POLITICAL SPEECH THAT. IT DOESN'T YOU KNOW WON'T ALLOW ON THE PLATFORM I DON'T THINK THAT HELPS ANYONE -- IN A LENGTHENING THE TERM SERVICE FOR ONE IS SOMETHING WE GET A LOT OF FLACK ON BUT I YOU KNOW. TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS. THE BILL WAS READ TO ALLOW US TO MODERATE CONTENT BASED ON EXISTING TERMS OF SERVICE WHAT'S THE GAME. ALSO AND SO WHAT PUTTING THE POLITICAL -- PROHIBITION IN THERE THEN IT'S GOING TO CAUSE A WHOLE RANGE OF CON OF CONTENTS THAT IT WAS IDENTIFIED BY THE SOME OF THE COMMITTEE. AS POTENTIAL POLITICAL AND BECAUSE THE PLATFORMS A LOT OF DIFFICULTY IN AND MODERATE. THAT'S HOW WE DO IT. OKAY WELL THE I THINK IT'S OUR JOB HERE TO TRY AND STRIKE A BALANCE ON A COMPROMISE BETWEEN. SOCIETAL GOOD ON THE ONE HAND AND INCONVENIENCE TO CITIZENS AND BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA THE OTHER. AND LAST YEAR I DIDN'T THINK THAT THIS BILL WAS THERE THIS YEAR I ACTUALLY DO THINK IT'S THERE. IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE. YOU COULD COMPLY WITH US -- IN HONOR THE SPIRIT OF IT NOW AND STILL BE ABLE TO DO THE THINGS THAT YOU SAY YOU NEED TO DO SO I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL AND I I I DO THINK THAT -- THAT YOU'VE DONE A GREAT JOB OF SOMEONE THAT AND AND WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION'S ON THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR GABRIEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- SO I JUST WANTED -- TO IT SHARE MY THOUGHTS THE THE AUTHOR I HAD A LONG CONVERSATION LAST NIGHT A REALLY -- I I THINK A POSITIVE CONVERSATION FORCE I'M NOT QUITE THERE YET ON THE BILL I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S IN A PLACE THAT I CAN SUPPORT AND I DO APPRECIATE. HIS HIS PRINCIPLE APPROACH TO THIS I THINK HE'S COMING AT IT FROM THE RIGHT PLACE I THINK HE HAS. THE RIGHT VALUES AND MINE BUT I I BELIEVE THESE ARE SOME OF THE MOST CHALLENGING PUBLIC POLICY QUESTIONS WE'RE GONNA FACE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE DECADES IS HOW DO WE REGULATE SPEECH ON THE INTERNET HOW TO WE ON ONE HAND -- LEAVE OURSELVES THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO GET RID OF SOME OF THE REALLY -- TROUBLING AND SCARY HATE SPEECH AND DARK THINGS THAT WE SEE ON THE INTERNET BUT THE OTHER TIME PRESERVE FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND AND I THINK WE SHOULD PROCEED WITH REAL CAUTION HERE. AND APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S THOUGHTFULNESS I KNOW THAT HE'S COMING FROM A GOOD PLACE BUT UNFORTUNATE THINK THAT THIS JUST NEEDS A LITTLE BIT MORE WORK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHAUNA SCENE OR THE COMMONS. OR QUESTIONS OUT [inaudible] SEC HI. HONESTLY I STRUGGLE WITH IS A LITTLE BIT -- AS WE HEARD. OF THE AUTHOR BROAD THIS -- A SIMILAR BILL TO US LAST YEAR. AND I ENDED UP SUPPORTING AT OUT WITH HIS COMMITMENT TO PUT THOSE CHANGES IN. NOW SUBSEQUENT TO THE HEARING OF AT LEAST COUPLE THINGS OF A HAVE HAPPENED IN ONE OF WHICH WAS THE THE NEW ZEALAND SITUATION. ON AND THEN THE OTHER ONE WAS THE ON THE A CASE OF A COURT CASE AND THAT'S ALSO DESCRIBED IN THE ANALYSIS AND THAT'S THE OF THE TWITTER CASE -- THE ON ALL JOHNSON VERSUS TWITTER AND WHICH ACTUALLY CAME OUT. ADEN TO BE IN FAVOR OF TWITTER. SO THE QUESTION IN MY MIND WAS YOU KNOW IS IT A RIGHT TIME FOR US TO IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR US. TO TO REGULATE I MEAN DO WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE SOCIAL MEDIA. TO DO LESS OR MORE OFTEN IN WHEN IT COMES TO REGULATING SPEECH. I KNOW THAT THE COUPLE CYCLES AGO I ATTEMPTED -- TO WORK IN A SIMILAR VEIN AND THAT IS I TRY TO TACKLE THE ISSUE OF FAKE NEWS. N. -- OBVIOUSLY IT IN GO GO TOO FAR BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT FIRST NAME AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE A MINEFIELD SO -- SO IT'S IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT AREA TO KINDA NAVIGATE -- I TO ADMIT BUT I DO WANT TO COMMEND -- MISTER GALLAGHER FOR VENTURING INTO AN AREA THAT I THINK. NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT MORE CLOSELY. SO I'M THAT'S THE REASON I GAVE A NINE RECOMMENDATIONS TO A MEMBERS ARE YOU KNOW FEEL FREE. TO VOTE THE WAY THEY SO DESIRE. I YOU KNOW. I I STILL STRUGGLE WITH THE DECISION WHETHER TO TO TO SUPPORT OR NOT BUT I I THINK OUR I WANT TO STAY CONSISTENT BECAUSE I I SUPPORTED YOUR BILL LAST YEAR -- WITH SIMILAR LANGUAGE AND AND IN HOPES THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE MORE CLOSELY BECAUSE THIS IS AN AREA LIKE I SAID IN A NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO REALLY VENTURE INTO. ALSO I ADMIRE YOU FOR THAT -- REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF TODAY'S HEARING -- TO SO WITH THAT I I'M GONNA ASK OUR THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. SO -- TO HIT IT SO SUPPOSED TO GO TO ARTS ENTERTAINMENT THAN SPORT. SO -- WITH THAT THE BEST A LOOK IN THE MIRROR SECRETARY THAT I CLOSE REALLY QUICK ALSO GO AHEAD I'M SORRY YOU CAN TRY TO BE AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE. WHAT I'D ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT IN YOUR VOTE IS THIS -- EVERYBODY UP HERE ACTUALLY AGREED THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM AND IT'S A IT'S A POLICY AREA THAT WE HAVE. TO THAT THAT NEEDS WORK RIGHT -- EVERYBODY AGREED ON THAT -- I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER VEHICLE THAT'S ACTUALLY DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE RIGHT NOW AND SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS I MEAN LOOK AGAIN I'M A REPUBLICAN. IN THIS LEGISLATURE IT'S NOT LIKE I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO STEAMROLL THIS THING THROUGH -- AND I THINK YOU KNOW FROM WORKING WITH ME THAT LIKE I'M VERY OPEN. TO YOU KNOW DIFFERENT IDEAS HOW CAN WE PLUG THIS HOW CAN YOU MAKE IT BETTER JUST LIKE WE'VE DONE WITH OTHER BILLS TODAY. HELP ME MOVE THIS ALONG LET'S WORK ON THAT I THINK A LOT OF THINGS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP BY THE OPPOSITION THEY CAN BE PLUGGED INTO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS NUMBER. ONE BUT WE COULD ALSO WRITE THESE TYPES OF THINGS INTO THE BILL AND THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE DO NEED TO DISCUSS BECAUSE HERE'S THE OTHER THING WE ALL AGREE ON IT'S BEEN WEAPONIZED. IN THE STATUS QUO RIGHT NOW TODAY OKAY IT'S BEEN WEAPONIZED UNDER THE CURRENT POLARIZATION UNDER THE CURRENT. YOU KNOW PEOPLE GOING INTO THEIR RESPECTIVE ECHO CHAMBERS THAT'S WHERE WE'RE VULNERABLE AND THAT'S WHERE. FOR EXAMPLE THE MULLER REPORTS SHOW THAT WERE VULNERABLE. AND YOU KNOW YEAH THE JUDICIARY COULD DECIDE THIS ISSUE I THINK. BY PASSING LEGISLATION IS ONE WAY TO GET IT TO GET IT TO THAT LEVEL RIGHT AND HAVE THEM DECIDE. YOU KNOW ONCE AND FOR ALL HEY WHAT IS THE SITUATION HERE BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS LET'S WORK ON THIS BECAUSE IT ISN'T BEING. THERE REALLY ISN'T ANYTHING RIGHT NOW THAT I THINK IS IS TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS SO. AS A COMMITTEE AS MEMBERS IN THIS BODY. LET'S TRY AND PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER THAT REALLY GETS AT AND STRIKES THAT RIGHT BALANCE. AND YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT TO DO THAT IF WE WERE ABLE TO MOVE THIS ALONG -- TODAY AND THEN I'D AS YOU THINK JUST. SO IMAGINE FOR A SECOND WHAT IF WHAT IF YOU DID GET BLOCKED. LIKE WHAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU WERE PUTTING OUT THERE SOME IDEA OR BLOCKED. UNDER THE CURRENT STATUS QUO OR SAYING IS YOU HAVE NO RECOURSE THERE ARE PRIVATE FORM. NOTHING YOU CAN DO RIGHT. IF WE'RE GOING TO SAY NO ACTUALLY THERE IS SOME. YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T JUST. COMPLETELY CENTER VIEW POINTS AND WE'RE GONNA AND WE'RE GONNA SAY THERE IS NO LEGITIMATE PUBLIC PURPOSE. THERE'S NO RECOURSE FOR YOU IF IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN TO YOU. RIGHT SO I MEAN KEEP THAT IN MIND IS THAT REALLY WHAT WE WANT TO DO WE WANT TO PUT A PRIVATE COMPANY WHO HAS A LOT. HAS A LOT OF SWAY RIGHT NOW ME A LOT INFLUENCE A LOT OF COMMUNICATIONS ELECTIONS. A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK K. THE ELECTION. LAST TIME WAS ONE A LOST ON SOME OF THIS SOCIAL MEDIA STUFF -- DO WE REALLY WANT TO PUT ALL THAT IN THE HANDS OF A PRIVATE COMPANY. TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION WHERE THE OTHER I I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT IT'S AT LEAST SOMETHING TO MAYBE MOVE THIS FOR A LITTLE BIT. FURTHER AND KEEP WORKING ON IT SO WITH THAT I'D ASK FOR YOU. TO HELP ME MOVE THIS ALONG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CHAO HI SO I'D KILEY.
