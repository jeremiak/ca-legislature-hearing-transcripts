EDUCATION FINANCE TODAY. IS THE. FIX MATT HEARING FISCAL CRISIS MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE TEAM THE ANNUAL UPDATE. ON THE FISCAL HEALTH OF OUR. SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND I WANT TO. BRING UP. FIND FROM A THICK MAT FOR FOR YOUR AND YOUR PRESENTATION. WE ALSO WANT TO. TO WELCOME BACK YEAH. BEAUTY AND I'M STILL GOING TO BE EMBARRASSED BUT KATIE KATIE HARD A MAN WHO'S JUST JOINING US AFTER HER LEAVE IT WITH HER AT. NEW BORN BABY. AT HOME SO WELCOME BACK. OKAY. IT'S FINE. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. SPECIAL GREETING TO A MEMBER MEDINA WHO REPRESENTS MY. MY HOME COMMUNITY. WHERE I LIVE? AND SO AS WE GREETED EACH OTHER IT'S NICE TO SEE EACH OTHER. OUTSIDE AN AIRPLANE OR OUTSIDE THE AIRPORT WHICH IS USED TO EVERY WE HAVE A GREAT CONVERSATION. UP MIKE FINE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF OF THE STATE'S FISCAL CRISIS AND MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE TEAM MY PLEASURE TO. UPDATE YOU ON A NUMBER OF TOPICS TODAY. WILL JUST GET STARTED AND. GO RIGHT AND YOU YOU ALL HAVE AN OUTLINE I'M JUST GONNA FOLLOW THAT. ON THAT OUTLINED IN START WITH A TOPIC OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS STABILITY. AS THE COMMITTEES AWARE ON MAYBE THE AB TWELVE HUNDRED PROCESS PROVIDES THAT EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT FILE TO INTERIM. FINANCE REPORTS EACH YEAR WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. RE REFER WE REFER TO THESE REPORTS IS THE FIRST AND SECOND IN ARMOR PORTS EACH DISTRICT SELF CERTIFY AS A POSITIVE QUALIFIED. OR NEGATIVE. ED. OR NEGATIVE CERTIFICATION THE COUNTY OFFICE THAN REVIEWS OUT REPORT AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION EITHER CONCURS OR DOES NOT CONCUR. WITH THAT SELF CERTIFICATION AND THEN THE PROCESS MOVES ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF ED. WITH RESPECT TO. ONE FINAL REVIEW OF OF THAT INFORMATION POSITIVE CERTIFICATIONS A STATEMENT OF THE DISTRICT WILL BE ABLE TO MEET ITS INANCIAL OBLIGATIONS FOR THE CURRENT PLUS TWO SUBSEQUENT FISCAL YEARS. QUALIFIED CERTIFICATION. IT MEANS THAT THE DISTRICT MAY NOT MEET ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS FOR THE CURRENT AND SUBSEQUENT FISCAL YEAR. AND A NEGATIVE CERTIFICATION MEANS OF THE DISTRICT WILL NOT MEET. ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS FOR THE CURRENT AND NEXT SUBSEQUENT YEARS SO IT'S A TWO YEAR WINDOW ON NEGATIVE AS OPPOSED TO THE THE THREE YEAR WINDOW FOR BOTH POSITIVE AND QUALIFIED. THE OFFICIAL RESULTS OF THE FIRST INTERIM ARE SHOWN IN YOUR MATERIALS. IN THE OUTLINE AND JUST BRIEFLY WILL TALK ABOUT THOSE ALTHOUGH THERE NOW THAT IS NOW DATED INFORMATION FROM DECEMBER. ON THE WE HAVE UPDATED INFORMATION I'LL SHARE WITH YOU BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW. KIND OF WHERE THE THE OFFICIAL DATA RESTS AT THIS POINT FROM DECEMBER. THERE WERE FORTY TWO QUALIFIED DISTRICTS UP FROM THIRTY ONE A YEAR EARLIER. IT'S NOTABLE THAT SIX OF THOSE FORTY TWO WERE ACTUALLY DOWNGRADES BY THE COUNTY OFFICE OF ED SO IN THAT EXAMPLE. THE DISTRICT SELF CERTIFY POSITIVE. AFTER THE COUNTY OFFICES REVIEW THEY CHANGE THE CERTIFICATION TO QUALIFIED IN DOWNGRADED I'M BELIEVING THAT THEY DID NOT MEET. THE CRITERIA FOR POSITIVE. THERE WERE FOUR NEGATIVES UP FROM THREE THE PRIOR YEAR. ALL FOR IN THIS IS BECOME KIND OF ROUTINE ALL FOR DISTRICTS THAT WERE NEGATIVE AT FIRST INTERIM WERE NEW TO THE LIST. AND THAT'S ACTUALLY REFLECTION THE PROCESS WORKING. DISTRICTS DON'T STAY ON A NEGATIVE CERTIFICATION LIST VERY LONG THERE'S A LOT OF RESOURCES THAT COME. AND ENCIRCLED THEM. FROM THE COUNTY OFFICE FROM ARE NOT ORGANIZATION FROM FACT MATT FROM CD EVE AND AND OTHERS AND AND BASICALLY. I'M TRIAGE AND GET THE DISTRICT BACK. TO FISCAL HEALTH AND THEN THEY MOVE BACK THROUGH THE PROGRESSION QUALIFIED ON AND BACK TO POSITIVE IS ALWAYS THE GOAL. ONE OF THOSE DISTRICTS PASADENA FROM THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY. BOB WHY THEY FILED A NEGATIVE THEY WERE NOT NEGATIVE THEY USED THIS PROCESS TO. MORRIS A POLITICAL PROCESS TO PUT SOME PRESSURE ON THEIR THEIR OWN BOARD. WHICH WAS NOT HOW THE SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO WORK THERE'S A DIFFERENT PROCESS TO DO THAT. AND SO AT SECOND IN A ROOM. THEY'VE ALREADY BEGUN TO WORK BACK. TO OF. A QUALIFIED IN A POSITIVE STATUS INGLEWOOD YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH. AND I'M A TALK MORE ABOUT IT IN JUST A SECOND FURTHER FALLS UNION OF VERY SMALL DISTRICT IN BUTTE COUNTY. TEN STUDENTS. THEY ARE GETTING FINANCIAL SUPPORT THIS YEAR AND FORECASTED FOR NEXT YEAR FROM THEIR COUNTY OFFICE FIVE OF THOSE TEN STUDENTS ARE IN SEVENTH GRADE THIS IS A K. EIGHT DISTRICT. AND SO THE GOAL IS TO GET THE FIVE OF THE TEN KIDS OUT. OF THAT SINGLE SCHOOL DISTRICT GRADUATED IF YOU WILL FROM EIGHTH GRADE COMMENCE FROM EIGHTH GRADE. ARM AND THEN THE DISTRICT WILL CEASE TO EXIST SO IT'S NOT ON THE EDGE OF NEEDING A STATE ALONE EMERGENCY PREPARATION THAT'S NOT THE PLAN. IS WOULD BE THE CASE WHERE THAT THE SCHOOL WOULD CLOSE THE DISTRICT WOULD CEASE TO EXIST AND IN NEIGHBORING DISTRICT VAN WOULD CHANGE ITS BOUNDARIES AND BEGIN TO SERVE WHAT WOULD BE THE REMAINING FIVE STUDENTS. ON THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE AT THE SCHOOL. YOU SOMEBODY I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT MORE IN JUST A MOMENT. AT SECOND IN ARM WHICH WERE DO JUST TWO WEEKS AGO AND SO THE DATA IS UNOFFICIAL THIS IS OUR SURVEY OF COUNTY OFFICES BASED ON DISTRICTS SELF CERTIFICATIONS. AND I'VE INCLUDED SOME SUMMARY DATA HERE BUT THE CHARTS THAT I ATTACHED TO MY OUTLINE REFLECT THIS SELF CERTIFICATION AS OF MID MARCH. ON YOU CAN SEE THAT THE COURT NUMBER QUALIFY DISTRICTS IS DOWN TO TWENTY FOUR. THERE WERE FORTY ONE A YEAR EARLIER AND AS I JUST MENTIONED JUST FORTY TWO A COUPLE MONTHS EARLIER. THE COUNTY OFFICES A NEW SHOW REVIEW INDICATE THAT THERE ARE ABOUT FIVE POSITIVES THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE DOWNGRADED TO QUALIFIED SO WE MAY SEE THAT TWENTY FOUR GROW. A LITTLE BIT. WHAT'S NOTEWORTHY HERE'S OBVIOUSLY THE CHANGE FROM FIRST AN ARM TO SECOND IN A ROOM AND. AND THEM THE MAJOR CHANGE IN DATA THAT WOULD OCCUR AT THAT POINT WOULD BE THE ADMINISTRATION'S JANUARY BUDGET THE GENERAL BUDGET PROPOSAL. I'M ISSUED BY THE ADMINISTRATION ARM HAS MORE FAVORABLE TERMS IN IT THAN DISTRICTS WERE EXPECTING JUST SIX MONTHS AGO OR EVEN A MONTH EARLIER. FOR THAT THREE YEAR WINDOW. AND THEREFORE. MANY MORE DISTRICTS OF OR POSITIVE AS OPPOSED TO QUALIFIED ON BECAUSE OF THE THE ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. THAT SECOND INTERIM THERE ARE TWO SELF CERTIFIED NEGATIVES INGLEWOOD A WHICH I'M GONNA GET TO SHORTLY FEATHER FALLS WHICH I JUST EXPLAINED TO YOU. THERE IS ONE DISTRICT THAT IS. QUALIFIED LIKELY TO BE DOWNGRADED TO NEGATIVE IN FACT WE HAVE SEEN THE DRAFT LETTER JUST IN THE LAST. DAYR SO. AND THE COUNTY IS I'M GOING TO BE DOWNGRADING THEM TO MAKE IT EVEN I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT THAT DISTRICT COMES BICU SOMEBODY I'M A TALK ABOUT THEM MORE IN JUST A MOMENT. THAT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF WHERE DISTRICTS ARE OF BOTH IN DECEMBER IN THEIR OFFICIAL REPORTING AND. AT LEAST IN OUR INITIAL SURVEY OF THEIR REPORTING THAT OCCURRED IN THE MONTH OF MARCH OBVIOUSLY IMPROVEMENT. AS I'VE ALREADY INDICATED DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY. THE BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT WAS RELEASED IN JANUARY. SCHOOL DISTRICT FISCAL EMERGENCIES. WANT TO TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT INGLEWOOD AS YOU KNOW WE'RE IN YOUR FIVE AFTER A EMERGENCY APPROPRIATION. ARE. OUR ANNUAL FIELD WORK IN INGLEWOOD. HAD COMMENCED A MONTH AGO. YEAR OF FAMILIAR WITH THE REQUIREMENTS IN THAT IS THAT FIVE WE REVIEW FIVE OPERATIONAL AREAS FISCAL FACILITIES. HUMAN RESOURCES GOVERNANCE AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS AND PUPIL ACHIEVEMENT. OF EACH YEAR AND RIDE A FAIRLY EXTENSIVE REPORT ON THAT THAT'S RELEASED. OVER THE SUMMER WE HAVE COMPLETED OUR FIELD WORK FOR THREE OF THOSE AREAS STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. HUMAN RESOURCES AND GOVERNANCE AND COMMITTEE RELATIONS WE SEE IMPROVEMENT IN ALL THOSE AREAS. HUMAN RESOURCES HAS BEEN OUR AREA WE'VE SEEN DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT OVER NOW SEVERAL YEARS IN A ROW. GOVERNANCE AS AND COMMITTEE RELATIONS I'M CONTINUING TO APPROVE THIS IS OUR FIRST YEAR AND FIVE REVIEWS THAT WE'VE SEEN. THE NEEDLE MOVE SLIGHTLY ON STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. A LOT OF WORK YET TO BE DONE BUT WE ACTUALLY SAW ON SOME GLIMMERS OF OF THE STANDARDS THAT WERE LOOKING. FANTASY AS WE VISITED CLASSROOMS HOW WE ARE IN THE DISTRICT NEXT WEEK TO BEGIN OUR REVIEW FOR FINANCE SAYS AN AREA THAT THE DISTRICT HAS STRUGGLED MIGHTILY AND. AND FACILITIES BOTH AREAS OF SIGNIFICANT I'M STRUGGLE FOR FOR INGLEWOOD UNIFIED IN THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS. I'M OBVIOUSLY FINANCES WHAT GOT HIM IMPART. TO TO BE ON THIS LIST TO START WITH ON WE DO EXPECT TO SEE IMPROVEMENT IN THOSE AREAS BUT WILL WILL HAVE A BETTER SENSE HERE IN THE COMING WEEKS. DISTRICTS THAT ARE AT RISK OF TALKED ABOUT THE NEGATIVE SPECIFICALLY. INGLEWOOD IN FEATHER FALLS I DO WANT TO SPEND. A MOMENT ON. THREE ADDITIONAL DISTRICTS WITH RESPECT TO. THEIR STATUS THE FIRST ISSUE SOMEBODY. ARE WHICH AT SECOND. BOTH AT FIRST INNER MAN SECOND IN ON THE DISTRICTS CERTIFIED QUALITY QUALIFIED THE COUNTY HAS DOWNGRADED. TOO NEGATIVE ON THIS IS US A. K. TWELVE DISTRICT ABOUT FORTY EIGHT PERCENT AND DUPLICATED IN ROMAN OF TWENTY ONE KIDS GENERAL FUND BUDGET OF ABOUT EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. OBVIOUSLY WE ALL KNOW WHERE YOU SOMEBODY'S LOCATED EASY LANDMARK. FOR ALL OF US. AT THE REQUEST OF THE MADERA COUNTY OFFICE OF GET COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT THICK MATS HAVE INTERVENTION STAFF PRESENT IN THE DISTRICT. OF SEVERAL DAYS A WEEK FOR OVER TWO MONTHS AND WE WILL BE RETURNING AGAIN. FOR SOME ASSISTANCE HERE IN THE COMING WEEKS THE DISTRICTS CRITICAL LEADERSHIP STAFF WERE ALL NEW TO THE DISTRICT OF EARLY IN THE YEAR. AND. NOT EVEN HALFWAY THROUGH THE YEAR THEY HAVE ALL DEPARTED. SO. OBVIOUSLY SUPERINTENDENT BUSINESS STAFF AND SO ON ARE ALL IT STARTED THE YEAR ALL KNOWN AS NEW ON THEY HAVE ALL NOW LEFT AND THERE IS INTERIM STAFF IN PLACE. IN THE DISTRICT. AN INTERIM SUPERINTENDENT IN OUR BUSINESS OFFICIAL. THEY'RE A GREAT DEAL OF WORK HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN THE LAST SIXTY DAYS FINAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FISCAL RECOVERY PLAN IS UNDER WAY. THE DISTRICT SELF CERTIFIED AS I MENTIONED QUALIFIED IT SECOND INTERIM HOWEVER. I WE DO BELIEVE IN AND PRETTY SURE THE COUNTY IS GOING TO DOWNGRADE DOES HAVE ALREADY SAID COUPLE TIMES NOW. THE DISTRICT CONTINUES TO HAVE AN APPOINTED FISCAL ADVISER BY THE COUNTY. WE BELIEVE THE HARD WORK OF DEVELOPING THE FISCAL RECOVERY PLAN. THAT WORK IS BEING DONE. AND ELEMENTS OF IT HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO BE IMPLEMENTED THE ISSUE REALLY THAT'S BEFORE US IS NOT ALL THE PIECES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED YET BUT THERE'S CLEARLY A. A GOAL TO DO THAT THE DISTRICTS FOCUSED ON THAT A WE ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A DISTRICT THAT IS I'M TURNING AROUND. ON RELATIVELY QUICKLY HERE AND AND. PROBABLY WON'T HAVE A NEED TO REPORT ON IT IN THE FUTURE. ADDITIONAL DISTRICT THAT IS ALSO NOT NEGATIVE BUT WE BELIEVE THIS AT GREAT RISK IS KLAMATH TRINITY. CLIMATE TRINITY OF ALL ONE OF A THOUSAND STUDENTS ON K. TWELVE ALSO EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT AND DUPLICATED PARA FIFTEEN AND HALF MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND BUDGET. WE'VE BEEN PROVIDING SUPPORT TO THE HUMBOLDT COUNTY BOMB SUPERINTENDENT SINCE LAST FALL IN ANALYZING THE DISTRICTS CASH FLOW. WHILE THE DISTRICTS GENERAL FUND OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN STABLE THE DISTRICT IS IN THE MIDST OF SIGNIFICANT SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION AND MODERNIZATION TO MITIGATE MAULED. IN ALMOST ALL OF ITS FACILITIES THE DISTRICTS QUALIFY IT. FOR AND IS BEEN RECEIVING SIGNIFICANT HARDSHIP FUNDING FROM THE STATE ALLOCATION BOARD. HOWEVER THE DISTRICT HAS NOT SCOPE THERE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IN LINE WITH THE FUNDING THEY HAVE OVER SCRIPT THESE PROJECTS IN THE FUNDING EVEN AT HARDSHIP BUT HUNDRED PERCENT. IS NOT GOING TO BE SUFFICIENT. TO COVER THE SCOPE THAT THE DISTRICT SET FORTH. THIS OBVIOUSLY EXPOSES THE DISTRICT TO SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL RISK AND CASH FLOW DIFFICULTIES. THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT HAS PLACED EXPERIENCE SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM MANAGER AT THE DISTRICT. ON TO ASSIST THE DISTRICT AND PROVIDE ANALYSIS AND COUNCIL WE THINK THAT PROCESS ACTUALLY IS GOING VERY WELL. OUR THERE'S OBVIOUSLY STILL SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THEY HAVE SELF CERTIFIED QUALIFIED AT FIRST IN A ROOM ON THE COUNTY DID CONCUR WITH THAT. SECOND INTERMENT STILL UNDER REVIEW AND WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT. WHERE ON THE COUNTY WILL ACTUALLY END UP? IT AGREEING OR NOT IT SECOND INTERMITTENTLY THAT THE DISTRICT IS QUALIFIED. BASED ON RECENT CASH FOR ANNOUNCES THE DISTRICT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MEET ITS CASH OBLIGATIONS WITHOUT SOME SIGNIFICANT CORRECTIVE ACTION. AND SO WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THAT. THE THIRD DISTRICT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT. HERE ARE BRIEFLY IS OAKLAND UNIFIED. THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS OF FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND BUDGET. I'M K. TWELVE AS YOU KNOW WHEN AND ROUGHLY SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT AND DUPLICATED. STUDENT POPULATION. IN. MANY OF YOUR FROM THERE TO HISTORY IN OAKLAND THAT THEY RECEIVED A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR EMERGENCY PREPARATION FROM THE STATE IN TWO THOUSAND THREE. THE DISTRICT MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TO JUSTIFY THE RESTORATION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. THERE IS STILL THOUGH AN SP I APPOINTED STATE TRUSTEE WORKING WITH THE LOCAL TEAM IN OAKLAND. AT THE REQUEST OF THE DISTRICT VIC MAC CONDUCT DID A FISCAL HOUSE HEALTH RISK ANALYSIS LAST SUMMER. AND CONCLUDED THAT THE DISTRICT SHOWED SIGNS OF FISCAL DISTRESS. AT THE REQUEST OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FIGMENT HAS BEEN IN OAKLAND SINCE JANUARY. PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN AN EFFORT TO ASCERTAIN THE TRUE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE DISTRICT FOR BOTH BUDGET FUND BALANCE AND ALSO FOR ON CASH FLOW FOR THE CURRENT YEAR. WE DID PROVIDE AN INTERIM STATUS REPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND A AND A. LARGER GROUP CD  <u><c.green>STATE BOARD STAFF</c></u> ON HERE IN THE CAPITAL JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. WE HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT OAKLAND ABOUT THEIR STABILITY ON FISCALLY. THEY HAVE. IN THE MIDST OF CHANGING LEADERSHIP IN THEIR BUSINESS FUNCTIONS. AND THAT'S A POSITIVE THING. HOWEVER AT THIS POINT IN TIME WE CONTINUE TO WORK THERE CONTINUE TO PULL TOGETHER ADDITIONAL DATA. ON TRYING TO BUILD OUR CONFIDENCE LEVEL ON IN THEIR ACTUAL LOCAL MEMBERS. AND WHAT HOW THEY ARE LEADING AND MANAGING TO THOSE NUMBERS WE'VE FOUND GAPS IN THE NUMBERS OF WHAT. THEY THOUGHT THINGS WERE COMPARED TO WHAT THEY REALLY ARE. ALMOND SO WHERE HIGHLIGHTING THOSE FOR THEM SO THAT THEY CAN ADJUST ALONG THE WAY. WHILE WE'VE NOT COMPLETED OUR HOUSES ARE PLANNER CONCLUSION IS THE DISTRICT DOES HAVE SUFFICIENT CASH. ON RESOURCES FOR THE CURRENT YEAR THROUGH JUNE. BUT IS. IN FISCAL DISTRESS AND MUST TAKE SIGNIFICANT CORRECTIVE ACTION TO STABILIZE ITS FUND BALANCE. AND CASH FLOW FOR SUBSEQUENT YEARS WHEN WE ENTERED THIS. IN JANUARY WE WERE ACTUALLY CONCERNED THAT THERE WERE QUICKLY RUNNING OUT OF CASH WHICH OBVIOUSLY TRIGGERS THE WHOLE STATE. EMERGENCY PORTION MATT HOWEVER THIS WOULD BE VERY UNCHARTED WATERS WHERE THEY HAVE AN EXISTING EMERGENCY PORTION. AND SO WE BELIEVE THE DISTRICT CAST SUFFICIENT CASH RESOURCES BY. WE'VE DISCOVERED A NUMBER OF THINGS WHICH ARE ADVERSE TO THEIR FUND BALANCE. AND AND THOSE ARE THINGS WE CAN DEAL WITH OVER TIME OBVIOUSLY CASH SHORTAGES NOTS IS AN IMMEDIATE ISSUE AND SO FROM THAT STANDPOINT. THE DISTRICTS IN BETTER SHAPE THAN WE THOUGHT IN OTHER RESPECTS IS ABOUT ONE THE DISTRICT. IS STRUGGLING A BIT. SOLVENCY TRENDS I'M JUST TO TOUCH ON A COUPLE THINGS IN THE OUTLINE. ELEAZAR. CONTINUE TO FACE COST PRESSURES INCLUDING PENSIONS AND SPECIAL EDUCATION ALL TOPICS THAT THIS BODY IS IS CLEARLY AWARE OF. AND SHOULD BE NO SURPRISE THERE. JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL HAS OF RT MENTION PROVIDES ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO MITIGATE THESE PRESSURES. I'M ONE TIME FUNDING PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO MITIGATE KNOWN ADVERSE TRENDS IN DISTRICTS IN THEIR PLANS. AND SO WHILE I'M ALL MONEY IS GOOD MONEY. FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY THEY APPEAL ON TO THIS BODY ON A REGULAR BASIS THAT MORE OF IT BE ONGOING VERSES ONE TIME. IN NATURE HOWEVER ARE POINT WOULD BE SIMPLY THAT ONE TIME MONEY DOES PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO HELP MITIGATE. EVEN SOME. RECURRING I'M OBLIGATIONS. MULTI YEAR PROJECTIONS SHOW A DEFICIT TREND AFTER EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AND SO THE LONG TERM PERSPECTIVE IN A DISTRICT IN ITS WITH ITS LEADER GOVERNANCE AND LEADERSHIP TEAM IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL. COST CONTAINMENT IN THE NEW. WORLD OF AL CAPS DOES LOOK A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN IN PAST TIMES WE'VE MADE VERY PUBLIC COMMITMENTS. ON THROUGH THE EL CAP PROCESS AND SO WHERE THE DISTRICT CHOOSES TO. EMPLOY SOME COST CONTAINMENT MEASURES. REALLY NEEDS TO BE DRIVEN BY THAT AL CAPP PROCESS IN THAT VERY PUBLIC AND OPEN DISCUSSION ARMED WITH ITS STAKEHOLDERS. A WE BELIEVE THE AL CAPP ACTUALLY PROVIDES. A GREAT BENEFIT AS A TOOL TO HELP BRING FOCUS IF YOU HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES THE ELF CAP PROCESS ON REALLY HELPS YOU TO FOCUS ON WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SPEND THOSE RESOURCES ON. I'M SPECIAL AS YOU LOOK OUT INTO THE INTO THE FUTURE YEARS. CHANGE TOPICS I'M VERY BRIEFLY. AND TALK ABOUT AB ONE THIRTY NINE EXTRAORDINARY AUDITS THAT AS YOU'RE AWARE. THE STATUTE PROVIDES. EACH OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS AND EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY. TWO WHEN AN ALLEGATION OF FRAUD MISAPPROPRIATION OF PUBLIC FUNDS. OR OTHER ILLEGAL FISCAL ACTIVITIES AS ALLEGED IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT OR CHARTER SCHOOL THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ON CALL UPON US. I'M TO DO THAT PULMONARY INVESTIGATION AND OUR THRESHOLD. IN DETERMINING WHETHER THERE'S EVIDENCE OR NOT BY THE SUPPORT THOSE ALLEGATIONS IS RELATIVELY LOW WE ISSUE A REPORT. AND THEN THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT UNDER CODE HAS. RESPONSIBILITIES TO ADVISE THE STATE. VARIOUS PARTIES HERE AT THE STATE AND ALSO THE LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF THE FINDINGS IN OUR REPORT. THE NUMBERS GENERALLY HAVE BEEN IN THE SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN RANGE OVER MANY YEARS OF HOW MANY OF THESE WE DO HERE. AND I'VE ACTUALLY GIVING YOU THE HISTORY FOUR SEVEN NINE SIX AND TEN. IN THE CURRENT YEAR. THERE WERE NOT COMPLETE WITH ALL THE OTHER NUMBERS ARE PRESENTED HERE ARE COMPLETE YEARS BUT IN THE CURRENT YEAR WE ARE UP TO SEVEN. I'M SORRY WE'RE UP TO NINETEEN REQUESTS I'M IT WAS ONLY SEVENTEEN TWO WEEKS AGO WHEN I PRESENTED TO ON THE SAME COMMITTEE AT THE SENATE. IN THE SENATE I'M JUST IN LAST TWO WEEKS TO ADDITIONAL REQUESTS OF COMMAND. THIS IS IT THIS IS NOT A TREND THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. TOM NOT A TREND THAT I THINK ANY OF US ARE REALLY PREPARED FOR. A WHEN I SPEAK ON A REGULAR BASES. AROUND THE STATE I AM DESCRIBING IT. A LITTLE BIT HERE AS A. A CRISIS IN ETHICS A CRISIS IN INTEGRITY. FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE BULK OF THESE AUDITS WERE AROUND CHARTER SCHOOLS HOWEVER IN THE CURRENT YEAR THAT'S NOT THE CASE. THE BULK OF THE NINETEEN THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AT REGULAR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THEM. ON THEIR ONLY HANDFUL CHARTER SCHOOLS. BOTH OF THE. TO RESET REQUEST IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS HAPPEN TO BE CHARTER SCHOOLS. BUT IT'S A TREND OBVIOUSLY THAT IS. A BIT WORRISOME TO ON. THESE ARE NOT CASES OF. THE PERSON IN FOOD SERVICE ACCOUNTS THE CASH. POCKETING SOME OF THE CASH EACH DAY AND WALKING OUT THESE THE COMPLEXITY OF THESE CASES. ARM ARE OUR INCREASE IN ALONG WITH A NUMBER OF THESE OUR CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS. BETWEEN BOARD MEMBERS BETWEEN SUPERINTENDENT AT THE VERY TOP OF THE ORGANIZATIONS. CONFLICTS WITH CONTRACTORS AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS TOO LARGE. INVESTIGATIONS OR CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN INVOLVE A. MULTI MILLION DOLLAR BOND PROGRAMS. WHERE THERE WERE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST POTENTIALLY IN HOW CONTRACTS WERE? CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN HOW CONTRACTS WERE AWARDED IN THINGS LIKE THAT. LEADERSHIP AND GOVERNANCE AN INTERNAL CONTROL ISSUES. REALLY ARE AT THE CENTER OF THESE. THEY INVOLVE BOTH THE GENERAL OPERATIONS OF THE DISTRICT AND BOND PROGRAMS AS ABILITY TO. AND. THEY OUR GENERATING THE ATTENTION NOT ONLY OF OF FOLKS HERE IN THE CAPITAL BUT THEY'RE GENERATING THE ATTENTION OF STATEWIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND ACTUALLY. A WE'VE BUILT A VERY STRONG PARTNERSHIP. WITH BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS SOME OF THESE MATTERS. HAVE HAVE THEM CONTINUED. WITHOUT. CHAIR BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. WITH THE CITY OF FIRST OF ALL LET'S TAKE ROLE. FOR REAL QUICK. IT'S MCCARTY. HERE. CHAVEZ THERE AMONG. MEDINA. FOR SITTING HERE. O'DONNELL. OBERNOLTE. OKAY AS TO MY TEACHING THANK YOU NOT MUCH CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER FINE FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. SO. IT IS IT TO. FAIR TO SAY THAT OVERALL THEY THAT THE TREND. WITH THE. NEVER EVER SINCE THE RECOVERY FROM THE GREAT RECESSION. HAS BEEN POSITIVE IN TERMS OF. DISTRICTS INDEED. QUALIFIED AREN'T NEGATIVE HAS BEEN DECLINING. SO WITH RESPECT TO QUALIFIED YES WE'VE SEEN KNOW A LITTLE BIT OF AN UP TICK IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS SAYS BECAUSE REMEMBER LOOKING AT A THREE YEAR WINDOW. AND SO IS WEEKS AS WE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE FORECASTING OUT FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF LCF AS WE KNOW IT. THEN OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE UNCERTAINTIES THAT FOLLOW THAT FULL IMPLEMENTATION RIGHT WE KNOW CURRENT LAW SAYS THE. INCLUDE THAT IN THEIR IN THEIR MULTI YEAR FORECASTS. SO FOR QUALIFIED QUALIFIED IF YOU LOOK OVER HISTORY THERE'S A CHART IN YOUR PACKAGE. QUALIFIED TENDS TO MOVE WITH THE STATE BUDGET I'M GOOD YEARS AND BAD YEARS OF OF STATE REVENUES. YOU HAVE. MORE QUALIFIED LESS QUALIFIED RIGHT. WITH RESPECT TO NEGATIVE THERE ARE SO MANY MORE ISSUES AT HAND IN A DISTRICT THAT CERTIFIED NEGATIVE. THERE ARE CLEARLY GOING TO BE GOVERNANCE ISSUES LEADERSHIP ISSUES AT ALL LEVELS I'M IN THE DISTRICT IT'S NOT JUST A FISCAL THE DETERMINATION MAY BE A BOTTOM LINE. DOLLAR NUMBER BUT BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF A NEGATIVE AND SO IF YOU LOOK OVER TIME NAY NUMBER NEGATIVE DISTRICTS ARE ACTUALLY FAIRLY CONSISTENT THERE ARE VERY LOW NUMBER. ON IN PART BECAUSE AB TWELVE UNDER PROCESS WORKS ON ANY IN PART BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST A FISCAL TRENDING. MATTER THAT THAT INFLUENCES NEGATIVE SO. WITH THANK YOU FOR. PLANNING S.. DIRECTING US TO THE CHARRED SO ACTUALLY FOR OUR FROM SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. IT AND THERE IS A INCREASING TREND AND THE NEGATIVE. SIR. OR OR QUALIFY CERTIFICATIONS BUT AS OF NOW. BE PROJECTED QUALIFY CERTIFICATION THERE'S A DIP FROM FORTY TWO TO TWENTY FOUR. THAT'S CORRECT BETWEEN BETWEEN FIRST AND WHICH WAS DECEMBER. AND THE INITIAL REVIEW OF SECOND AND ARM WHICH WAS MARCH AND AND THAT'S LARGELY THROUGH. THE GOVERNOR IS. FAST TRACKING THE FULL FUNDING OF THE. LCF A FUNDING. THE BIGGEST SINGLE IMPACT IN THAT CHANGE WOULD BE THAT YES SIR ALRIGHT. PHAM BUT I ALSO NOTICED THAT. THAT. MANY OF THE DISTRICTS THAT YOU'D. HIGHLIGHTED AS AS BEING GUY EITHER AND NEGATIVE TERRITORY OR. OR. PERHAPS HEADED TO OR DISTRICTS AT RISK. THEY WERE. LARGELY DISTRICTS THAT HAVE A HIGH ON DEPLETED STUDENT POPULATIONS. SO AND SO ON. WHILE THESE DISTRICTS ARE GETTING. MORE DOLLARS UNDER THE LCF A FUNDING FORMULA. THEY. THAT HAS NOT TRANSLATED INTO. HEALTHY. STABLE BUDGET SITUATIONS IS IS THAT FAIR TO SAY. AT LEAST FOR THESE OF THE DISTRICTS THAT YOU HIGHLIGHTED PS AND FOR THE DISTRICTS ARE HIGHLIGHTED. SO WE GO BACK A LITTLE BIT IN HISTORY SINCE AB TWELVE HUNDRED IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO. THEIR BEEN NINE DISTRICTS OF NEED TO COME TO THE STATE FOR AN EMERGENCY APPORTIONMENT. LEADING UP TO THE LEGISLATURE'S ADOPTION OF AB TWELVE UNDER. JUST IN THE I THINK THE DECADE BEFORE THAT THERE WERE SOME TWENTY. FIVE IF I REMEMBER THE NUMBER RIGHT NOW LOW TWENTIES. AND SO. THAT IMPART SPEAKS TO THE PROCESS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE WISDOM THEY HAD AT THAT TIME PUT IN PLACE. THAT PROCESS. THE DISTRICTS THAT I'VE HIGHLIGHTED IN AND LET ME SAY OF THE NINE THIS IS WHERE I WAS PROCESS HERE THAN NINE THAT NEEDED A STATE APPORTIONMENT IT WAS ULTIMATELY CASH THE LACK OF CASH WHAT WE CALL CASH INSOLVENCY THAT PUSHED HIM OVER THE LINE ON A GIVEN DAY. WHY WE NEEDED TO COME TO A LEGISLATURE FOR AN EMERGENCY APPORTIONMENT? BUT THERE WERE YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS OF LEADERSHIP AND GOVERNANCE ISSUES THAT PREDATE THAT SINGLE EVENT. THE DISTRICTS I HIGHLIGHTED HERE HAVE LEADERSHIP HAD IN THE NEAR TERM. RECENT PASS LEADERSHIP AND GOVERNANCE ISSUES. WHICH WHILE THERE WHY THEY'RE ON THE LIST. AND SO. I WOULDN'T. I'D BE CAREFUL WITH THE ONES WE HIGHLIGHTED TO SAY. THAT DESPITE AND EXPANSION OF OF REVENUES DURING THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL CFF. THAT. THAT. THAT WAS A POSITIVE EVENT OBVIOUSLY FOR EVERYBODY. AND FOR THEM. BUT IF THE RIGHT LEADERSHIP AND GOVERNANCE IN THE RIGHT FOCUS SHOULD THE EL CAP PROCESS ON STUDENT NEEDS. AND SO ON ISN'T ALL IN ALL THOSE ELEMENTS ARE NOT IN PLACE. THEN EXPENDITURES ARE GOING TO BE A LINE TO THE RIGHT THINGS. AND SO. IN THE ONE CASE. CLIMATE TRINITY IT'S A FACILITIES ISSUE NOT OBJECT NOT OF INSTRUCTIONAL OPERATIONAL ISSUE. IN THE CASE OF YOU SOMEBODY WE'VE HAD SOME BREAKDOWN IN LEADERSHIP. IN THE CASE OF OAKLAND WE HAVE A NEW LEADER THERE SINCE JULY. DOING GREAT WORK. BUT WE'VE HAD SOME INCONSISTENCIES IN OAKLAND OVER THE LAST DECADE FROM A LEADERSHIP AND GOVERNANCE STANDPOINT. AND ALL OF THAT HAS IS A LEAD TO THEIR CURRENT SITUATION. MY ONLY IN RESPONDING TO SERVE MY MY ONLY POINT REALLY IS THAT WHILE EACH OF THESE DISTRICTS WITH HIGH IN DUPLICATED ACCOUNTS. HAVE RECEIVED. LARGER PER DOLLAR. HOUND ALLOCATIONS APARTMENTS IF YOU WILL. TOM THEIR ISSUES ARE RELATED TO THAT THEIR ISSUES ARE REALLY. RELATED TO A BIGGER A BIGGER PICTURE HERE WHO SPECIFICALLY LEADERSHIP IN CONGRESS. OKAY AND UP. SO I WAS ENCOURAGED TO SEE THAT. AYE AYE REPRESENT. A PORTION OF LOS ANGELES UNIFIED AND AND IT APPEARS THAT THEY HAVE MOVED OFF THE QUALIFY CERTIFICATION LIST IS THAT CORRECT. AS YOU KNOW SIR LA IS A UNIQUE HOUSE UNIQUE. TWO ITS OWN RIGHT. THEY'RE CURRENTLY NOT ON THE QUALIFIED LISTS THEY ARE WORKING AS YOU KNOW. THEY'VE BEEN WORKING THROUGH YEARS OF ISSUES. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE COUNTY ULTIMATELY LEAVES THEM IN THEIR IN THEIR CURRENT REVIEW OF SECOND INTERIM. BUT THEY ARE. ATTACK UNIQUE PROBABLY FROM EVERYBODY ELSE IN IN. THE RISK ASSESSMENT THAT'S DONE. ON. SO THEY GET THEIR OWN RISK ASSESSMENT THEY DON'T GET THEIR OWN RISK ASSESSMENT WE HAVE STANDARDS AND CRITERIA THEIR PLIGHT EVERYWHERE. WHAT IS? SO THERE'S BOTH IF I CAN. DESCRIBED THIS WAY THERE'S BOTH A SCIENCE AND AN ART TO THE AB TWELVE UNDER PROCESS THE SCIENCE IN PART IS CONSISTENT. STANDARDS AND CRITERIA THEY'RE APPLIED BUT YOU YOU GO TO A DIFFERENT LEVEL AND DEPTH. WHEN YOU'RE WHEN I COUNTIES RECESS US ASSESSMENT OF A GIVEN DISTRICT THAT THERE'S A HIGHER RISK. SO TO NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS COULD HAVE THE EXACT SAME STUDENT POPULATION EXACTS IN FUNDING. ONE MAY HAVE SOME HIGHER RISKS THAN THE OTHER. BECAUSE OF HISTORY COULD BE LEADERSHIP HISTORY COULD BE GOVERNMENT'S HISTORY COULD BE. ARMED A WHOLE VARIETY OF THINGS COULD BE FACILITY CHALLENGES IN THE CONDITIONS OF THE FACILITIES. AND SO THE DEPTH AT WHICH A COUNTY OFFICE DOES THAT IS UNIQUE. AND IT AND SHOULD BE. VERY CANDIDLY. BUT THEY ARE FOLLOWING THE SAME SET OF CRITERIA AND STANDARDS THAT ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES FALL. DURING. BUT MY MY POINT ABOUT OLLIE IS THE ARE UNIQUE THEY ARE NOT COMPARABLE. TO ANYBODY ELSE IN THE STATE FROM. JUST COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES. JUST PURELY BASED ON SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE DISTRICT. OKAY. ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I'VE BEEN HEARING OF BOTH FROM LARGE. URBAN DISTRICTS LIKE LA UNIFIED AS WELL AS. SMALLER DISTRICTS IS. AND THAT. INDEED THE BASE GRAND PORTION OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA HAS HAS BEEN. INADEQUATE ESPECIALLY IN ADDRESSING THE. AT THE TO. BIGGEST DRIVERS OF COST INCREASES PENSION COSTS AND SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS. ARM. PRIOR TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FULL. AN EXPEDITED FUNDING OF LC FFI IT WAS HEARING. THIS WITH MORE URGENCY. ARM. IT INDEED DO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS AS TO WHETHER YOU. I MEAN WILL WE ALL KNOW THAT WE'RE DUE FOR A. RECESSION AT SOME POINT AND THAT WE ARE READY. I HAD BENEFITING FROM. THE LONGEST. POST WAR. EXPANSION AND IN THAT WERE DUE FOR A RECESSION. I ES DE YUBA. DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS IN TERMS OF. THE PROJECTED TREND. IN. NEGATIVE ARE. CERTIFICATIONS RELATIVE TO THIS ISSUE OF THE ADEQUACY OR INADEQUACY OF THE BASS GRANT. SO I THINK IT'S BEST THAT I LEAVE IT A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ADEQUACY OR INADEQUACY OF THE BASS GRANT TO MY COLLEAGUES IN FINANCING ELIO I THINK THEY HAVE. A CONVERSATION WITH THEM OVER THAT WOULD BE. FAR MORE PRODUCTIVE. WITH RESPECT TO TREND THOUGH. WHEN WE WHEN DISTRICTS ARE PREPARING THEIR MULTI YOUR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS THIS SPRING WHICH WOULD INCLUDE. NEXT. THE BUDGET YEAR PLUS TWO ADDITIONAL YEARS THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THEY ARE STARTING TO TREND DOWNWARD IN YEAR OVER YEAR REVENUE GROWTH. WHILE EXPENDITURE GROWTH IN SEVERAL CRITICAL AREAS IS TRENDING UPWARD. YOU MENTION AND TWO OF THOSE PURGED TERROR SPECIAL AT THREE OF THOSE REALLY PENSIONS AND SPECIAL ED. OR TWO ON THOSE ARE CLEARLY. AS YOU KNOW. ARE INCREASING. WHILE REVENUE YEAR OVER YEAR REVENUES NOT NEGATIVE YEAR OVER YEAR REVENUE IN THE OUT YEARS AS MUCH FLATTER. LITTLE SOFTER AND SO THAT WILL DEFINITELY HAVE AN IMPACT GOING FORWARD ON THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED DISTRICTS I DON'T KNOW THAT WILL IMPACT THE NUMBER NEGATIVE AGAIN. BUT DEFINITELY QUALIFIED IT WILL. THE SAME DISTRICTS HAVE RECEIVED A LOT OF ONE TIME FUNDING. SIX PLUS BILLION OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS HOW THEY'VE USE THAT. HAVE THEY USED IN THAT TO MITIGATE SOME OF THOSE LONGER TERM OBLIGATIONS SUCH AS PENSIONS AND SO ON. ALSO AS PART OF THAT EQUATION HAS TO BE LOOKED OUT SETS UP IT'S A BIGGER ANALYSIS THAN JUST THE BASE GRANT. IT'S A BIGGER ANALYSIS BUT IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT. WE CAN REASONABLY EXPECT. AN INCREASE INCREASING TREND AND QUALIFIED CERTIFICATIONS. FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS BASED ON CURRENT FORECAST YES AND IT WON'T TAKE AS THE LA O. IN FINANCE BOTH HAVE. SPOKEN TO HIM. IN. IT WON'T TAKE MUCH OF A RECESSION. IF YOU WILL OUR OUR ADVERSE IMPACT ON STATE REVENUES TO. TO HAVE THAT. SAME INFLUENCE ON THAT TREND. ARE. THANK YOU. THINK I WANTED TO ASK THEM SOME. QUESTIONS SYSTEM I KNOW EVERY DISTRICT IS DIFFERENT AND THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES ARE ARE UNIQUE. HOW THEY GOT HERE BUT AFTER DESPITE INTERESTING THAT YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN IS MY FOURTH YEAR HERE? AND. I THINK THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS WE'VE HAD AT. UPTAKE IN PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING SCHOOLS ARE DOING BETTER AND SO FORTH. AND SO YOU SAW THAT THE NUMBER OF THE OF THE THAT DID. DISTRICTS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE M.. AND THE PROBLEM AREA WE'RE GOING DOWN AS WE START PUTTING MORE MONEY OUT THE DOOR TO OUR SCHOOLS AND THEN THE LAST FEW YEARS. THEY'VE. GOT UPGRADED NEXT YEAR YOU PROJECTED TO GO BACK DOWN. HOW DO YOU? HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT AND THIS SEEMS COUNTERINTUITIVE? IT DOES I THINK IT'S. SO FIRST REMEMBER THAT THESE EVALUATIONS ARE DONE ON THAT IN A THREE YEAR WINDOW. SO FOR EACH OF THE POINTS THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND AND SO ON. YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT CURRENT YEAR PLUS TWO ADDITIONAL YEARS IN THAT EVALUATION AND SO WITHIN THAT WINDOW. OF THREE YEARS AND AND THE REASON YOU SEE THE TREND THAT YOUR YOUR. REFERRING TO MISTER CHAIR IS. IS ACTUALLY A FAIRLY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. BE GOES JUST BACK A YEAR TO THE FIRST ENORMOUS SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN ONE WHICH UP FROM FOURTEEN TO THIRTY ONE. THAT BEGAN TO. LOOK AT WHAT WAS THEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. NINETEEN TWENTY. ARE WITH WHY WE WERE STILL ON TRACK FOR A EIGHT YEAR IMPLEMENTATION OF LCF HALF NOT AN ACCELERATED. IMPLEMENTATION. AND SO IN THOSE IN THOSE LATER YEARS YEAR TWO ONE THREE IF I CAN REFER TO THEM THAT WAY. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN NINETEEN TWENTY YOU SEE. COSTS RISING FASTER. THEN YEAR OVER YEAR REVENUE. SO AGAIN EURO YOU'RE REVENUES POSITIVE GROWTH NOT NEGATIVE GROWTH. HOWEVER THE COSTS WERE RISING AT A HIGHER RATE. AND SPECIFICALLY. AS I WAS JUST ALLUDING TO PENSIONS. SPECIAL ED. AND. NOT REALLY HIGHER RATE BUT A COMPONENT OF ALL THIS WOULD BE STEP IN CALLING. ON SALARY SCHEDULES IF YOU TAKE JUST THOSE. JUST THE FOUR ELEMENTS OF STIRS PURRS. STEPPING COLUMN. WHICH IS THOSE AUTOMATIC TYPE OF. PROGRESSIONS ON AS OUR SCHEDULE FOR YOU BASED ON YEARS OF SERVICE ARE EDUCATION ATTAINMENT AND SPECIAL ED AND SPECIAL IT'S GOING TO VARY WIDELY BY DISTRICT. AHMED AL OR EXPLAIN THAT JUST A SECOND YOU LOOK AT JUSTICE FOR ELEMENT MOST DISTRICTS WOULD DESCRIBE THOSE ELEMENTS AS SOMETHING NOT UNDER THEIR LOCAL CONTROL. RIGHT WHERE EVERYTHING ELSE IN THERE BUDGET WORLD IS KIND OF UNDER THEIR LOCAL CONTROL IS TO TO EXPAND PROGRAM ACTS TO EXPAND PROGRAM WHY. DO WE ADD TEN ADDITIONAL COUNSELORS THAT'S THE LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD ON HAS THE ABILITY TO DECIDE THAT. THE THE PURSE RATES THE STIRS RATE STEPPING CALM COURSE WAS. PUT GUY SET IN STONE NEGOTIATED IF YOU WILL. DECADES AGO. AND THEN THE VERY BOND SPECIAL ED IS THIS IN YOUR OFTEN THEY WITH THIS A. B. SIX A TWO WHICH IS STATE MASTER PLAN FUNDING FOR SPECIAL ED. IS BASED ON TOTAL ENROLLMENT. TOTAL ENROLLMENT IN FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR DISTRICTS IS ACTUALLY DECLINING. BUT THERE SPECIAL ED POPULATIONS NOT NECESSARILY DECLINING AT THE SAME RATE IN FACT IN MANY CASES IT'S INCREASING OR REMAINING FLAT SO AS A PERCENTAGE OF ENROLLMENT IT'S ACTUALLY GOING UP. IT'S BEEN BETWEEN TEN AND ELEVEN PERCENT FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND IT'S ACTUALLY STARTING DECEPTIVELY. INCREASE. AND START DIXIE BILL ELEVEN PERCENT. MARK OF ENROLLMENT SO. WHILE SPECIAL ED REVENUE THEN IS DECLINING BASED ON TOTAL ENROLLMENT SPECIAL IT COSTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY DECLINING. AND THAT'S PART OF THE EQUATION. OKAY THANK YOU QUESTIONS MISTER CHAVIS. STRONG TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION HOW YOU FIND THIS VERY. INTERESTING I'M EVER THE FIRST ONE I TENANTS SIX YEARS AGO. AND SEEING HOW YOU USE. HOUSE GOES. YEAH IT'S ONE OF MY CONCERNS AS FAR AS THE PENSIONS AND SPECIAL EDUCATION. I THINK THE COMMON I'LL JUST MAKE ON THAT IS. I THINK WERE. WE'RE SEEING SOME LOT OF GROSS IN THE. THE QUALITY OF OUR EDUCATION I HOPE WE CONTINUE TO GO THAT WAY SINCE MY LAST YEAR. SIMMONS BRIEF I WOULD. HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATORS WOULD. LOOK AT THE CONTINUE INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION SO WE DON'T GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN. AND. EVEN THOUGH THEIR WE MAY BE A DOWN ECONOMY. THAT WE WOULD MAKE A EDUCATION A PRIORITY MUCH BEYOND THE FIFTY PERCENT THAT WE FOR SOME REASON WE MADE THAT ARE. SCHILLING RATHER THAN THE FLOOR. THAT'S REPUBLICANS SAY THAT BY. GET THAT DOWN YET OKAY. YEAH. YEAH. HOPE YOU GUYS ARE FOLLOWING ME. THE. THE GOVERNMENTS IN THE COMMUNITY RELATIONS COMPONENT YOU TALKED ABOUT LEADERSHIP. HAVE YOU SEEN THAT IMPROVE BECAUSE OF HEALTHCARE. HE MENTIONED DEL CAB BRIEFLY BUT HAVE YOU SEEN THAT. A PROCESSES WE LAID OUT IS I NOTICED WE JUST WE STARTED THE LOW CONTROL FUNDING INTO DEVELOPMENT OUT CAP. AS I WAS TALKING TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN FACT ONE OF MINE IS HERE. THE. IN MY ESTIMATION. GOING OUT TALKING TO PARENTS AND COMMUNITIES AND BUSINESS OWNERS. THIS PARTICULAR SCHOOL DISTRICT. DID NOT DO IS ROBUST SAID NOT REACH. AS THE OTHER NEIGHBORS SCHOOL DISTRICTS AHEAD OF MY DISTRICT. SO FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE LOOKING AT A MACRO SENSE. CAN THE EL CAP REALLY BE A POSITIVE THING TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T HAVE. ISSUES. I THINK THEY'LL CAP IS A VERY POWERFUL AND POSITIVE TOOL THAT'S BEEN INDUCED ARM IN SOME RESPECTS ARM I THINK IT'S KINDA SAD THAT. IT TOOK THE LEGISLATURE TO. TO DO THAT INCOME OF FOUR STEP PROCESS ON ON LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SO IN MY EXPERIENCE BOTH IN A DISTRICT BEFORE I CAME TO FACT MATT ANTS IN MY TIME IT TOOK ME OUT. THE EL CAP. PROCESS ONE DONE IN AN AUTHENTIC WAY. REALLY AUTHENTIC. ENGAGEMENT WITH. PARENTS TEACHERS CLASSIFIED FOLKS BUSINESS LEADERS IN THE COMMUNITY GOVERNMENT LEADERS IN A COMMUNITY. STUDENTS AND REALLY STUDENTS AT ALL LEVEL NOT JUST HIGH SCHOOL BUT STUDENTS AT ALL LEVELS. IS. ABSOLUTELY INCREASES COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. COMMITTEE RELATIONS. THERE'S ONE. THE. ONE ANY OF US ARE ASKED OUR OPINION ABOUT SOMETHING THEY WERE LISTENED TO. THAT'S GOING TO INCREASE DIALOGUE IT'S GONNA INCREASE IN UNDERSTANDING OF PROCESS SKINNER. INCREASE ON APPRECIATION FOR THE CHALLENGES. AND A CONTRIBUTION TO THE BENEFITS AND SO ON FOR THE DISTRICTS THAT ARE DOING THAT THEY DO IT VERY WELL. ON THEIR OUT CAPS REFLECT THAT ENGAGEMENT THAT REFLECT THE COMMUNITY THAT THE BROADER COMMUNITIES PERSPECTIVE ON THINGS. AND THEY'LL LYING THEN THE KEY TO ALL THIS IS YOUR LINE YOUR RESOURCES TO CARRYING OUT THOSE ITEMS. AND SO IN MY EARLIER COMMENTS TALKED ABOUT HELLCAT BEING A TOOL THAT HELPS US FOCUS EVEN IN A CAR IN A COST CONTAINMENT ENVIRONMENT. NOT AN EXPANSIONARY ENVIRONMENT BUT A COST CONTAINMENT ENVIRONMENT THE ALL CAPS A TOOL THAT WILL HELP DISTRICTS FOCUS. ON WHAT IS IMPORTANT WHAT ARE THEY GONNA INVEST IN TODAY THAT'S GONNA MOVE THAT NEEDLE. IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION FOR KIDS WITH THEIR ACADEMIC SOCIAL EMOTIONAL WHATEVER THE METRIC IS THAT WE'VE ASSIGNED THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED TO THE EL CAP PROCESS. IS OUR PRIORITY IT WILL HELP THEM MOVE THAT NEEDLE AND SO ON IT IT HELPS FOCUS THAT. THAT INVESTMENT OF THE DOLLARS THAT WE GET. AND I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE LIKE A THOUSAND TWENTY FOUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE. AND SO WE HAVE THE SMALL NUMBER THAT. HAVING DONE I'D BE INTERESTED TO SEE NOW HOW DID THEY DO IN THE EL CAP AND USER. EVERITT RELATIONSHIP THERE AND FTL CAP. IS HIGHLIGHTED AS A SOLUTION. THEN IF WE FOCUSED ON ON THAT PROCESS. THEN WE COULD EVEN SEE A DROP DOWN MORE SIGNIFICANTLY. BAR THE ISSUE OF US NOT FUNDING. THE SCHOOLS REGARDLESS OF ECONOMICS. THE. AB ONE THIRTY NINE. EITHER TRENDS YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT GOING UP UP ENOUGH RIGHT. IS THIS ISSUE THIS IS A SOFT REPORTING EFFORT IS IN THAT THEY GET IDENTIFY HEY WE MAY HAVE A PROBLEM OR YOU GET WIND OF IT TO A HOTLINE BINGO. RACE DOWN THERE HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN SO THIS IS. AT THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT LEVEL. SO AN ALLEGATION IS BROUGHT FORTH TO THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT. IN THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT. KIND OF DIGS AROUND A LITTLE BIT TO ASCERTAIN THE CREDIBILITY OF THE ALLEGATION. AND THEN. ASSUMING THAT THEY WANT THEY BELIEVE THE ALLEGATION HAS SOME MERIT. THEN THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CALL UPON US WHAT THEY GET THROUGH THE FORMAL AB ONE THIRTY NINE PROCESS THROUGH THICK MAT IS. THE TEAM THAT WE ASSEMBLE TO GO DO THE INVESTIGATION OUR SCHOOL EXPERTS AND FRAUD EXPERTS OVER HALF OF OUR STAFF ARE CERTIFIED FRAUD EXAMINERS. IF THEY COME INTO OUR AGENCY WITHOUT THAT CERTIFICATION WE HELP INVEST FOR THOSE WANT TO MAINTAIN A BALANCE OF OUR STAFF BUT THEY'RE ALL. THEY ALL HAVE SCHOOL DISTRICT BUSINESS EXPERIENCE. AND SO THEY GET. SPECIALISTS IN THOSE AREAS WERE GOING TO INVESTIGATE A BAR ALLEGATION AROUND A BOND PROGRAM THEY'RE GONNA GET SOME OF OUR STAFF WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE RUNNING. BOND PROGRAMS AND FACILITY PROGRAMS IN THE DISTRICT ALONG WITH. THE FISCAL AND FINANCIAL AN INTERNAL CONTROLS AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. THAT'S THE VALUE OF THAT PLUS THE COST TO DO THAT INVESTIGATION ARE REIMBURSED BY THE STATE. WE ARE ONLY I CAN ASSURE YOU THIS WILL ONLY SEE AND HEAR ABOUT THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG ON THESE BECAUSE MOST OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS. ARE INITIATED BY THE LOCAL DISTRICT. THEY DON'T REACHED THE COUNTY OFFICE THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS THE DISTRICT HERE'S AN ALLEGATION ABOUT A GIVEN EMPLOYER OR ISSUE. THEY INITIATE THEIR OWN PERSONALITY VESTED CATION THEY MAY HIRE A LAW FIRM OR OR FORENSIC ACCOUNTING FIRM. WANTED TO HELP THEM WITH THAT PROCESS AND THEN THEY TAKE THE ACTION. THAT THEY'VE THEY TAKE WHATEVER CORRECTIVE ACTION AND AND. FOLLOW UP ACTION AND IT DOESN'T INVOLVE THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS OF THIS PARTICULAR SECTION OF THE. STATUTE IS ON. A FORTY FOR THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS HAVE A TOOL ON THAT WHEN THEY RECEIVE AN ALLEGATION. THAT THEY CAN CALL UPON US AS A RESOURCE. WITH I THINK TWO EXCEPTIONS THIS PAST YEAR WE'VE DONE ALL OF THE WORK IN THOSE TWO EXCEPTIONS ONE. WE HAD A CONFLICT WE ARE IN THAT DISTRICT RIGHT NOW ASSISTING THEM IN ANOTHER AREA WE WERE COMFORTABLE THAN DOING. A FRAUD INVESTIGATION THE SAME TIME SO WE REFERRED THAT OUT TO A. THE COUNTY OFFICE ACTUALLY. HIGHER DAY ACCOUNTING FIRM WITH. FRAUD EXPERIENCE DOWN TO ACTUALLY CONDUCT THAT WORK. AND WE WILL WE WILL ULTIMATELY. THE USING THE STATE FUNDS THAT WE RECEIVE FOR THAT PURPOSE PAY FOR THAT WORK ON THAT'S BEEN DONE. SO THE COST REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE STATE. SO YOUR BUDGET I THINK MY NOTES ARE SHOWN THAT YOU HAVE A. FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS BUDGET. WITHIN THAT. IT'S WITHIN THAT FIVE POINT THREE OR IS IT SEPARATE NOTES WITHIN THAT FIVE POINT THREE. IT'S IN ADDITION TO OUR BASE ALLOCATION OF THE TWO POINT NINE THERE'S A SEPARATE ALLOCATION FROM. THE ORIGINAL AB ONE THIRTY NINE. WAS ORIGINALLY. CHOOSE BACK WAYS BUT WAS ORIGINALLY CREATED AS A CATEGORICAL PROGRAM AND THEN IN THE. THE. THE COLLAPSE OF THE CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS UNDER LC FF IT REMAINED A SEPARATE FUNDING ITEM OUT THERE. SO IF I'M A FIXED AMOUNT I'M A SUPERINTENDENT IN A FIGHT. HERE AT ISSUES OF LICIT CONTRACT ISSUES. FIVE GO OUT AND HIRE SOMEBODY WITHIN THE DISTRICT TO DO THE AUDIT. IT KEEP IT WITHIN THE HOUSE. I AS A SUPERINTENDENT I GUESS WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT OUTSIDE OUT. YES FORTIFY IS A SUPERINTENDENT SAY YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO. HIGHLIGHT THIS TO MY COUNTY. IN THE COUNTIES THAT HAVE YOU COME IN. THEN YOU DO IT AND THE STATE PAYS FOR. AND THEN I AS SUPERINTENDENT DON'T HAVE TO PAY THE MONEY FOR. WHAT IT IS THAT CORRECT? SUCH. THAT'S ALL CORRECT. IT'S NOT AN AUTOMATIC PROCESS THERE'S A. ON INITIAL ENGAGEMENT IN THAT CONVERSATION. TRYING TO REALLY DETERMINE. THE MERIT OF THE ALLEGATIONS OF THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGATIONS AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS IN MANY CASES. THE ALLEGATIONS COME WITH A VERY. WITH A LOT OF EVIDENCE. I MEANS I THIRD PARTY IS MAKING ALLEGATION THEY SEND YOU THE DOCUMENTS THAT THAT DO THAT. WE WOULD OFTEN SAY TO COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT POINT WE'RE NOT GOING TO ADD VALUE TO THIS PROCESS WHAT'S HELP YOU REACH OUT TO YOUR LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY. HAVE THEM US IN THEIR PUBLIC INTEGRITY UNIT HAVE ASSIGNED INVESTIGATOR AND AND DO THE WORK AND AND AND WE DON'T THEN GET INVOLVED. IN SOME CASES THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY THEN COMES BACK AND SAYS. WHILE THIS IS SOME SPECIALIZED AREA THAT. WHILE WE GET THE BASICS WE NEED SOME ASSISTANCE IN THAT CASE THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT MAY TURN TO US TO HELP. THE HELP DIG UP THOSE THOSE SPECIFICS SO WHEN YOUR PRE NOT THIS COMMITTEE BUT IN THIS ROOM RIGHT FOR. YOU. COMMENCE THIS HEARING WAS A PREVIOUS WAS ANOTHER HEARING. AND THERE'S A COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT. THAT TESTIFIED WHO I THINK IS STILL SITTING BEHIND ME. DOCTOR WHITE FOR RIVERSIDE COUNTY. WHEN SHE RECEIVED AN ALLOCATION AND AN ALLEGATION ON A COUPLE DIFFERENT THINGS IN THIS PAST YEAR. SHE DID SHE AND HER STAFF DID THEIR HOMEWORK. TO DETERMINE. KIND OF THEIR CONFIDENCE LEVEL IN THAT IN THAT. ALLEGATION AND THEN REACHED OUT TO US FOR ASSIST. THANK YOU FOR THAT EDUCATION AB ONE THIRTY NINE HITS AS VERY GOOD THANK YOU SIR FOR YOUR. PRESIDENTIAL. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT. SEEING NONE THIS IS IT INFORMATIONAL ITEM. THANK YOU FOR THE ANNUAL UPDATES AND FOR YOUR SERVICE. FOR OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. YEAH
