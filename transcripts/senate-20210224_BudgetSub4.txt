FOR THE DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD DIFFICULTY WITH MONTH END CLOSING YEAR AND CLOSE PROCESSES AND ARE GENERALLY A SMALLER DEPARTMENT FINANCE HAS WORKED TO TRANSITION THEM TO THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES CENTRAL FINANCIAL SERVICES- UNIT. WHICH PERFORMS THEIR ACCOUNTING FUNCTIONS. DGS RECENTLY LAUNCHED A STRIKE TEAM THAT PROVIDE SPECIFIC- SPECIFIED ACCOUNTING ASSISTANCE TO SELECT DEPARTMENTS. STRUGGLING OR DEALING WITH TEMPORARY VACANCIES SO AGAIN THESE ARE NOT SMALL ENOUGH DEPARTMENT TODAY WOULD PERMANENTLY GO OVER TO. THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES CONTRACTED JUST WILL SERVICES SECTION BUT RATHER THIS IS A ONE TIME NEED THAT THEY HAVE THAT SOME INTENSIVE. HELP CAN GET THEM ACROSS NOT. ACROSS THE FINISH LINE SO ONE SUCH EXAMPLE ARE ONE SUCH DEPARTMENT THIS YEAR AND THAT THE DDS STRIKE TEAM WAS CRITICAL IN HELPING.

TO PERFORM THEIR OWN ACCOUNTING BACK EXTENSIONS IN THE FUTURE FOR FUTURE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THANK YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE THERE'S A MYRIAD OF SERVICES THAT FIFTY ON OUR PARTNERS ARE OFFERING TO DEPARTMENTS TO ADDRESS DELAYS IN PERFORMING MONTH END AND YEAR AND CLOSE TASKS AND SUBMITTING THEIR YEAR END FINANCIAL REPORTS TO THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. AND I I'M HAPPY. TO REPORT THAT OUR EFFORTS ARE PAYING OFF. IT MEANS OVER ARE CLOSING. PERCENT FAST THIS YEAR THAN THEY WERE JUST TWO YEARS AGO. AND WE HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED AND I TESTIFIED TO THIS COMMUNITY BUT THERE IS A THREE YEAR LEARNING CURVE WITH THE SYSTEM. WITH A CHANGE THAT WAS MADE IS LARGEST S. AND WITH OUR LARGER MORE COMPLEX DEPARTMENTS NOW APPROACHING THEIR THIRD YEAR USING THIS METHOD STYLE SYSTEM WE EXPECT THIS PROGRESS TO CONTINUE. SO IN AN EFFORT TO BUILD ON THIS MOMENTUM AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR I JUST LAST MONTH WE LAUNCHED THE FIRST OUR LEARNING CENTER WHICH IS A ONE STOP LEARNING EXPERIENCE THAT CENTRALIZES. ALL OF THE COURSES ALL OF THE TRAINING THAT WE OFFER TO END USERS SO THEY CAN MASTER THE SKILLS NEEDED TO BECOME CONFIDENT AND SUCCESSFUL SYSTEM USERS. SO AGAIN ALL OF THE DIFFERENT MEDIUMS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO REACH. THE OUR CLIENTS AYE BECAUSE EVERYBODY LEARNS AT DIFFERENT RATES AND WITH WITH DIFFERENT TOOLS FOR PROVIDING THEM ALL SO THEY CAN HAVE. EITHER ACCESS TO THAT TRAINING COURSES THAT ARE IN PERSON- RITUAL IN THIS CASE. OR IF THEY JUST NEED I NEED ACCESS I HAVE I'M STUCK ON A PO I NEED TO ACCESS THIS RIGHT NOW THEY CAN GO TO THE LEARNING CENTER AND THEY CAN BE DIRECTED. TO INFORMATION ON HOW TO PROCESS THAT HERE WHERE THEY ARE- I'M VERY PROUD OF ALL THAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND WHAT TWENTY TWENTY HAS PRESENTED. A LOT OF CHALLENGES DUE TO THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC. THIS GAL HAS CONTINUED TO THRIVE AND WE HAVE CONTINUED TO MOVE THE SYSTEM FORWARD. AS WE MATURE. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR RUN THOROUGH EXPLANATION OF WHAT'S GOING ON- ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THIRTY OFTEN. I THANK YOU FOR OUR LONG TERM CONVERSATION YESTERDAY. THE HELP TO SWAY SOME OF MY CONCERNS I WOULD LIKE TO REPEAT HERE TO THE- COMMITTEE. AS WE TALKED YESTERDAY I SHARED MY CONCERNS WERE MORE GLOBAL THAN SPECIFIC THAT. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY INCOMPETENT AND APPLYING NEW TECHNOLOGY. AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF TAXPAYER MONEY WASTED. AND THESE CONTRACTS NEVER COME IN ON TIME NOW YOU'VE GIVEN ME SOME COMFORT THAT MAY BE DISCOUNT IS NOT ON THAT SAME SORRY TRACK. NOW THIS IS THE IT WAS SAID I THINK WE CAME UP JUST A TEN OR ELEVEN DEPARTMENTS WERE NOT YET TO COMPLETED I THINK YOU JUST SAID SEVEN IS THAT CORRECT NOW. YEP AND WE'RE STILL. THERE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING THEIR DATA TO YOU. SORRY IS MY CRIME SORRY YES SENATOR WE HAVE SEVEN DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF CLOSING THEIR MONTH AND- AND WE DO HAVE AT FOR. DIFFERENT REASONS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS WELL AS THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE ARE ENGAGED WITH THESE DEPARTMENTS WITH US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN ET THEM CLOSER THAT THEY HAVE A BETTER EXPERIENCE NEXT YEAR IN THE SYSTEM WOULD TRANSMIT THE NAME OF THOSE SEVEN DEPARTMENTS TO MY OFFICE I DON'T KNOW IF I COLLEAGUES CARE BUT I'D LIKE TO JUST KNOW THE NAMES OF THE AGENCIES. YES I CAN DO THEN WE CAN KIND OF FOLLOW UP ON THEM IT'S ALSO IT SHOULD THE DISTRUST BECAUSE AGENCIES USUALLY WILL JUST STONEWALL YOU INSTALL YOU AND NOT GET YOU INFORMATION. AND FIGURE YOU'RE GONNA FORGET IT. AND- I THINK WE AFFORD DO THAT IN TEXTILE ANYMORE IT'S COSTING FAR TOO MUCH MONEY- THE THESE TAX DOLLARS THAT WE WASTED- AND THE EASY DOLLARS WE'VE WASTED. REALLY COULD HAVE GONE A LONG WAYS TO HELP THEM WITH SOME OF OUR BUDGET CHALLENGES SO WE WE'VE GOT TO BE VERY FASTIDIOUS. AND CAREFUL ABOUT IT- NOW. I SHOULDN'T. TEAMS THAT GO OUT HELP AGENCIES ARE HAVING PROBLEMS. A MULTIPLE DISCIPLINE OTHERS SEVERAL DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS CAN IT GET A DEDICATED PEOPLE TO DO THAT OR DO YOU. DEPLOY THEM FROM YOUR OWN DEPARTMENT. SO BETWEEN- THE DEPARTMENT OF SYSTOLIC WE PROVIDE SOME ASSISTANCE WHEN IT COMES TO MORE THE TECHNICAL AND OF THE COMPUTER EARLY THE WORK AND JUST OUT. OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS PROVIDING ON SITE NO SUPPORTER- ASSISTANCE NOTHING IS ON SITE AT THE MOMENT THAT YOU KNOW SOMEONE ON WIND ASSISTANCE WITH THE DEPARTMENTS ON ACCOUNTING SIDE. AS IT IS THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES THEY WERE FUNDED FOR A STRIKE TEAM SPECIFICALLY GOES IN IT AND HELPS- DEPARTMENTS THAT. ARE JUST ON THE CUSP OF THOSE AT THE MEETING A LITTLE BIT MORE. IT AS PART OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY I REQUEST IN BC KEY THAT WE HAVE ON THE LEGISLATURE THAT WAS GRANTED WE DID HAVE SOME DOLLARS TO SEND CONTRACTORS OUT. TO SOME OF THESE MORE AT. TICKETS TO SOME OF THE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE HIS STRONG. SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE MORE ONE ON ONE AS WE MOVE INTO THE FUTURE THAT IS A ROLE THAT YOU SEE MORE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PLAYING. AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES- BULLARD REMIND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WOULD LIKE TODAY COMMUNICATING WITH US ABOUT THEIR ROLE TO. YOU KNOW WHAT COULD BE MORE COMFORTING THAN NOT TO KNOW THE TWO AGENCIES ARE TO DEPARTMENTS ARE. FAR OVERSEEING SO I'D LIKE TO KNOW TO WHAT DEGREE FINANCE CONTINUES TO BE ENGAGE. ANOTHER QUESTION I DON'T THINK WE TALKED ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY. A LOT OF THE LICENSES ARE PROVISIONAL NOW. AND THAT WAS A MIGHT THAT IT TELLS ME THAT THAT WAS AUTHORIZED BY THE LEGISLATURE TWO YEARS AGO THESE PROVISIONAL LICENSES. DESERVE STAND THROUGH OR WITHOUT TRANSITIONING TO ANNUAL LICENSES OR EVERYTHING STILL PROVISIONAL. WE HAVE LICENSES FOR- R. EIGHTEEN R. FIFTEEN THOUSAND END USERS AND- I DON'T KNOW THAT I KNOW- WHAT WHAT THE TERMS ARE OF THAT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I CAN SEE IF I CAN GET SOMEBODY TECH TO SEND ME THAT INFORMATION I'LL GET IT TO YOU AS FAR AS HOW MANY YEARS WE READ UP. ON THE CONTRACT FOR THOSE LICENSES BUT WE YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE PEOPLE SOFT LICENSES THE HYPERION LICENSES WE DO IT FOR ALL FIFTEEN THOUSAND AND USERS WELL THERE ARE A LOT OF LICENSES AT THE STATE HAS AND THAT COULD BE AN EXPENSIVE THING I WOULD JUST LIKE TO KIND OF FLAG THAT TO KEEP US ADVISED. HOW MANY HAVE TRANSITIONED DOWN. FROM THE PROVISIONAL STATUS. AND YOUR CONCERN. THE REGULATORY. FUNCTIONS INTO ONE DEPARTMENT WHAT DEPARTMENT IS THAT THAT WILL BE HANDLING ALL OF THE REGULATORY MATTERS. SO THE FOUR PARTNERS WILL RETAIN THEIR REGULATORY AUTHORITY IN THEIR RESPECTIVE AREAS THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES CONTINUES TO REGULATE- CONTRACTS AND- YOU KNOW THE SMALL BUSINESSES CERTIFICATIONS THERE JUST UTILIZING OUR SYSTEMS WE'RE CONSOLIDATING WHERE THE FOUR PARTNERS DO THEIR WORK. BUT THE AT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE STILL SETS THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR THE DEPARTMENT THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE STILL CONTROLS THE VENDOR MANAGEMENT LAST- FOR ALL OF THE VENDORS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GATHER ALL OF THAT THE TAX INFORMATION FOR ALL OF THOSE SO THE FOUR PARTNERS RETAIN THE POLICY. ON THE REGULATORY ABILITIES AND WE ARE THE TOOL THAT THEIR LOCALIZING TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OKAY WELL THAT IS IMPORTANT A LOT OF AGENCIES TAKE LIBERTY WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT AND WE DON'T WANT. TO SEE THAT HAPPENING HERE- LET ME JUST TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE HAS A RECALL. HERE THE- THE COMPLETION DATE ON THE SAYS CALIFORNIA'S APPLICATION WITH THAT. THE TWENTY TWENTY THREE OR TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SO WE WILL BE DEPLOYING ALL OF THE REQUIRED REQUIRED FUNCTIONALITY WILL GO IN ON JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO- WHICH WOULD AT THAT POINT JUST GOT WOULD BECOME A BROKEN RECORD WE WILL BE PRODUCING THE KAFFIR IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO A YEAR- AFTER THAT. AND I GATHER YOU HAVE A SCHEMATIC OR SOMETHING OF THE PROGRESS THAT YOU'RE MAKING THEN AND MAKING THIS HAPPEN BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE ANOTHER WOULD YOU HAVE MILESTONES DATES INCORPORATED TO GUIDE YOU. WE DO AND WE HAVE THE FINAL FUNCTIONALITY FOR THE SCO IS BEING RELEASED IN THREE RELEASES WE'VE ALREADY RELEASED- SOME OF THE FUNCTIONALITY THE FIRST. PART OF IT WENT IN DECEMBER OF. TWENTY TWENTY THE NEXT. FUNCTIONALITY WILL GO IN AND THEN THE FINE PIECE GO AGAIN THIRTIETH- TWENTY TWO ONE OKAY. THERE'S ANOTHER OBJECT IN THE STAFF COMMENTS SAYS. THE UTILITIES OTHER PROVIDERS ARE STARTING DOCTOR CHARGING SERVICES THAT MIGHT BE MORE COST EFFICIENT WATER THESE CHARGING SERVICES THOSE WOULD BE TO HAVE. THE UTILITY WOULD DIRECTLY CHARGE YOUR USERS ARE OR HOW WOULD THAT WORK. I AND I ACTUALLY NOT FAMILIAR WITH OKAY WELL WE CAN WE CAN GET BACK ON THAT IT WAS A WHAT IN OUR STAFF. COMMENTS AT THE END SO WE CAN FOLLOW BACK UP WITH YOU ON THAT POINT AGAIN IT WAS ABOUT TO BE OFFERING THE PROVIDERS WERE OFTEN CHARGING SERVICES AND I THINK I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I'M NOT SURE. AND THEN I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW THAT IF THAT IS IN FACT THE CASE THEY'RE OFFERING CHARGING SERVICES HOW DOES THAT MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT OR EFFECTIVE OR LESS COSTLY. AND THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO ME AS WELL- AND I THINK THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT FOR NOW MANAGER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MEMBERS I ENDED VIRTON THEY FORGOT TO ASK FINANCE IN THE ALLEY- SO I'M GONNA GO BACK TO THAT IF YOU THINK OF NO QUESTION YOU WANNA ASK PLEASE LET ME KNOW- RETURNING IT OVER. NOW RIGHT NOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I INTERNET WENT FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE HAVE NOTHING FURTHER TO. COMMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH LEGISLATIVE ANALYSTS. GOOD AFTERNOON BRIAN METZGER LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE APPRECIATE THE DETAILED SUMMARY INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA SO WE KEEP OUR COMMENTS BRIEF- FIRST WE WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE ADMINISTRATION FOR APPROVING KEY CHANGES IN THE PROJECT SCHEDULE AND SCOPE IN SPR NINE- WE FIND THE UPDATED PROJECT SCHEDULE AND ASK YOUR NINE TO BE MORE REASONABLE. AND SEOS ACCEPTANCE OF KEY FINANCIAL REPORTS AND THE FISCAL SYSTEM TO BE A MORE LOGICAL DEFINITION OF PROJECT COMPLETION- WE WOULD NOTE HOWEVER THAT THE NUMBER OF HOURS THAT IS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE INTEGRATED SOLUTION HAS INCREASED OVER TIME. AND AS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IDENTIFIED ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS AND REFINE SOME OF THE PLAN FUNCTIONALITIES THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT HAS CHANGED A BIT- WE REMAINED A BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE CHANGES AS WELL AS THE BACKLOG OF ENHANCEMENTS AND FUNCTIONALITIES THAT WILL REMAIN AFTER THE ADMINISTRATION. DEEMS THE PROJECTS COMPLETE AND SO AS THE PROJECT APPROACHES TO MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER WAYS TO OVERSEE THE COMPLETION. OF THAT REMAINING BACKLOG THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YES CENTER NIELSEN. THE DALLAS WELL. I'M NOT WILLING TO JUST LEAVE THAT LOOSE ENDED HOW COULD WE TIE THAT UP IN OTHER WORDS YOU YOU'RE VOICING CONCERNS THAT I. CERTAINLY DO SHARE. AND WHAT KIND OF CONTROL MECHANISMS AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT REPORTING REPORTING IS ABOUT IS IT INEFFECTIVE IS ANYTHING GOING GOOD JUST. SEND US A LETTER. WHAT KIND OF CONTROL MECHANISMS COULD WE PLACE IN THE BUDGET TO TRACK AND KEEP THIS THING ONLINE YOU KIND OF INTIMATED THAT THERE SOMETHING WE COULD DO WHAT WOULD THAT BE TO THE ANALYST. I WOULD SAY THAT THE FORMAL PROJECT OVERSIGHT PROCESS- WOULD BE COMPLETED ONCE THE ADMINISTRATION DETAILS THE PROJECT COMPLETE SO THAT JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO DEADLINE- WARD STOP FORMAL PROJECT OVERSIGHT. BUT FOR THE REMAINING BACKLOG IT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THAT EITHER IN THIS BUDGET CYCLE OR THE NEXT THE LEGISLATURE COULD ADOPT SOME FORM OF BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE OR OTHER REPORTING LANGUAGE TO. IDENTIFY THOSE ITEMS THAT ARE CONSIDERED ENHANCEMENTS OR FUNCTIONALITIES THAT WERE MOVED OUT OF THE PROJECT SCOPE AND TO HAVE THE ADMINISTRATION FORMALLY REPORT ON THOSE OR TO HAVE OUR OFFICE OR SOME OTHER- OVERSIGHT ENTITIES SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY CONTINUE TO REPORT ON THAT. THE DEPARTMENT'S PROGRESS- IN COMPLETING THOSE ITEMS WELL I HAVE NOT THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE IN THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY WHAT THEY'RE BEST AT IS CHANGING THE NAME. I'M BEING A LITTLE BIT FACETIOUS BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN CONTROL OF THESE EXCESSIVE OVERRUNS. AND TECHNOLOGY. MATTER THAT WE'RE PUTTING THIS ALL AROUND THE A CHAIR YES THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL HERE IF WE MAY I'D LIKE TO KIND OF. HAVE OUR- TO GET. MAJEURE MINORITY STAFF WORK WITH THE ALLEGE ANALYST IN THE DEPARTMENT AND TO TRY TO CLARIFY WHAT THAT LANGUAGES AND- GET IT IN THIS YEAR RATHER THAN TO WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR AND IT'S NEBULOUS AND WHATEVER IT DID. IT WOULD IT'S NO HARM I DON'T THINK TO DO THAT AND IT WOULD BE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO HAVE US NOT LEAVE THINGS SO OPEN ENDED AND- VAGUE THAT WE CAN. MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THE JOB DONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK THAT MIGHT BE GOOD DIRECTION TO GIVE TO THAT. TO STAFF. AT THIS CENTER ON. THE MANAGER YOU KNOW- I'M NOT SURE ABOUT TO OFFERING IN ASKING TOUGH QUESTIONS AND CERTAINLY HAVE FOR THINK I HAVE IN THE PAST ON IT PROJECTS IN THE YEARS THAT HAVE PASSED. BUT IT CAN GOING THROUGH THIS AGENDA I WAS THINKING BACK AND IT SEEMS THAT NOW AS OLD AS I AM THAT I'VE BEEN AROUND- CERTAINLY NEAR THE BEGINNING OF THIS PROJECT AT LEAST FROM THE OPERATIONAL STANDPOINT. AND IT'S BEEN A LONG ROAD. AND SOMETIMES THAT ROAD HAS BEEN AND- A LITTLE BUMPY AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT BEEN. AN EXPENSIVE TO GET TO WHERE WE ARE WITH THIS CRITICAL PROJECT. BUT WE'RE ALMOST TO THE FINISH LINE WITH WHAT APPEARS TO BE. THE SUCCESSFUL A LARGE VERY LARGE SUCCESSFUL IT PROJECT AND I THINK THAT SOME NOTEWORTHY AND I WANTED TO BE ONE TO SAY THAT. YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY CONTINUED OVERSIGHT TO ON IT PROJECTS AND OTHERPROJECTS AS A AND R. IS OF COURSE OUR JOB AND THE ISSUE OF- AND HIM OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE FIRST THE SCOPE OF CONTRACT AND THAT'S ALWAYS AN ISSUE IT SEEMS TO BE WITH THESE IT PROJECTS AND I THINK WE'LL- WILL SOLVE THAT ISSUE- WITH OUR OVERSIGHT IN OUR HELP BUT- I AM PLEASED TO THINK THAT IT LOOKS LIKE I MAY ACTUALLY BE AROUND TO SEE THE COMPLETION OF A LARGE. SUCCESSFUL IT PROJECT IN THIS STATE. I LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING THAT REPORT AND I JUST WANTED TO- TO TELL THE FOLKS AT FISCAL THANK YOU FOR YOUR DILIGENCE AND FOR MOVING THIS PROJECT FORWARD AND- I'LL BE THERE WITH YOU WHEN WE CROSS THE FINISH LINE THANK YOU MANAGER. YOU SENATOR- LET ME LET ME ECHO THE SAME SENTIMENTS- EIGHT THIS IS A ONE OF THE LARGEST PROJECTS I THINK IT'S EVER BEEN ENVISIONED AT THE STATE AND- ME YOU'VE HAD TO BRING EVERY SINGLE DEPARTMENT KIND OF KICKING AND SCREAMING TO THE TABLE AND I KNOW THAT THEY WERE KICKING AND SCREAMING BECAUSE I WAS IN THE ADMINISTRATION ALL OF THAT WAS HAPPENING. SO I SAW IT MYSELF THE FIRST HAND- LET ME JUST- SAY THAT I ECHO THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED UP BY- BY SENATOR NELSON AND REALLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS THE I BELIEVE IS A LIST OF THE- BACKLOG OF FUNCTIONALITY THAT WAS REMOVED FROM THE CONTRACT AND WHERE- I EXPECT THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE WITH THAT FUNCTIONALITY REMOVED BECAUSE IT COULDN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE IT BECAME OBSOLETE OR OR WHY. BUT AN EXPLANATION FOR- WHAT WHAT WHAT DIDN'T GET DONE AND WHAT THE PLAN IS FOR GETTING IT DONE IF THERE IS WHEN I THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I SEE AS AS A AS BEING IMPORTANT BUT I WANT TOTHANK YOU FOR THE THOROUGH EXPLANATION FOR WHERE YOU'RE AT RIGHT NOW I DO WANT TO SEE THE- THE SEVEN DEPARTMENTS AND UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER WHAT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE FACING AND NOT GETTING THEIR- THEIR WORK DONE- AND- AND WHEN IT WILL BE DONE BECAUSE IT BECOMES CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WITH THAT WE NEED TO CLOSE OUT THE BOOKS THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT AND- IT'S LONG OVERDUE SO. ANY EXPLANATION. FOR THAT IT WOULD BE REALLY REALLY HELPFUL. THE NOW FOR THE COURT. THIS IS A NEW. ITEM I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION HERE TODAY TODAY IT'S BEEN VERY THOROUGH.

CHARLES MUTED I'M HAPPY TO LEAVE OUT SENATOR THAT'S OKAY YES- I MAYBE IF WE COULD START WITH THE DEPARTMENT FIRST. THANK YOU. SIR YES- JASON KENNEY AGAIN DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES- SO I'LL TRY TO BE BRIEF THIS HISTORIC BUILDING WAS CONSTRUCTED IN NINETEEN TWENTY NINE IT SITS ACROSS THE STREET IN THE CAPITAL. BETWEEN NINETEEN TEN STREETS. INFRASTRUCTURE STUDIES GOING BACK TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND REPEATEDLY SINCE AND HAVE RECOMMENDED A FULL BUILDING RENOVATION. IN FACT IN ITS NINETY TWO YEAR HISTORY ASIDE FROM SOME SEISMIC WORK DONE IN THE NINETIES THE BUILDING HAS NEVER UNDERGONE ANY- RENOVATION THE LITTLE A SIGNIFICANT RENOVATION- THIS IS A PROJECT LIKE THE OTHER TWO ON THE AGENDA. THAT WAS AUTHORIZED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO BEGIN ITS INITIAL DEVELOPMENT IN JULY TWENTY EIGHTEEN- AND I ACTUALLY- PRIOR TO BEING RICH ON BY THE ADMINISTRATION LAST YEAR WAS APPROVED TO MOVE FORWARD TO THE SECOND PHASE- BY THE SUBCOMMITTEE- THE- VACATING OF THE FUNDERS AND BUILDING- AS PART OF THE NEW NATURAL RESOURCES PROJECT WILL ALLOW US. TO RELOCATE TENANTS TO THAT BUILDING- PRIMARILY THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE AND GIVE US A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY TO RENOVATE THE BUILDING AS IT SO DESPERATELY NEEDS- AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WITH A NINETY TWO YEAR OLD BUILDING THE WORKING NEEDED TO PRESERVE IT IS EXTENSIVE. THE NECESSARY SCOPE OF WORK INCLUDES THE REPLACEMENT OF EVERY MAJOR BUILDING SYSTEM CUTTING ELEVATORS PLUMBING HEATING VENTILATION AIR CONDITIONING ELECTRICAL TELECOM AND SECURITY AS WELL ADDRESSING SOME CRITICAL FIRE LIFE SAFETY ISSUES- ALL SYSTEMS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BEYOND THEIR USEFUL LIFE IN DANGER OF FAILING. AND THE UNDER BUILDING IN PARTICULAR HAS A SIGNIFICANT WATER INTRUSION ISSUE THAT PUTS THE BUILDING IN DANGER OF FALLING INTO A PERMANENT STATE OF DISREPAIR. OTHER PROPOSED RENOVATION LIKE ALL OF OUR OTHER NEW CONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATION PROJECTS THAT WE ARE WORKING ON- WILL BE FULLY TELEWORK ENABLED- IN FACT WE HAVE HAD SOME. PRETTY REMARKABLE SUCCESSES IN OUR NEW BUILDINGS- INCREASING. DENSITY WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL BUILDING- AND OUR DESIGN PRINCIPLE- WE ARE PRO THE PRIME WITH OUR LINE WITH. DESIGN GUY. ON POST COBIT BILL- THIS FOR. AND ALL KIND OF DO IS REACH THEM BUT THIS. WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE STATE'S ECONOMY- ARE A COMMUNIST PROJECTS RENOVATION WHAT WILL DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY CREATE OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED JOBS OVER ITS- OVER ITS LIFETIME. WHICH DOESN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF KEEPING SUPPLIERS COMPANIES IN BUSINESS RATHER THAN LAYING THEM OFF- THE PROJECT WILL ALSO HAVE SKILLED LABOR AGREEMENTS- ALL CONSTRUCTION JOBS WILL PROVIDE A LIVING WAGE AS WELL AS THE SKILLS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR A LIFETIME OF WORK. AND THE PROJECT WILL INCLUDE COMMUNITY WORKFORCE AGREEMENTS WHICH WE HIGHLIGHTED IN OUR OTHER SACRAMENTO PROJECTS WHICH BRINGS THE FOCUS ON EQUITY IN FUTURE EMPLOYMENT THAT- IS UNHEARD OF FOR STATE PROJECTS. ARE FINALLY TWO QUICK NOTES ONE IS THE- JESSIE I'M BUILDING DOES HAVE A FOR A STARK FOUNTAIN OUTSIDE THAT IS MENTIONED IN THE AGENDA- OUR OFFICIAL PROPOSAL TAKES A DO NOTHING APPROACH WITH THE FOUND WE'RE NOT. REQUESTING MONEY OR AUTHORITY FOR IT THERE'S NO FUNDING IN THE PROJECT REQUEST TO RENOVATE IT. NO FUNDING PROPOSED TO DEMOLISH IT EITHER- I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN SENT LETTERS I KNOW YOU'LL LIKELY HEAR PUBLIC COMMENT- WE HAVE NO- PROJECTIONS OR OR CONCERNS- IF YOU WERE ASKED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH. THE RENOVATION OF THE FOUNTAIN AS WELL AND THEN OBVIOUSLY- AFTER I TREASURE MAS- TESTIMONY AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR. COMMENTS THAT MAY ARISE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DEPARTMENT IF I. DEPARTMENT FINANCE DOESN'T HAVE ANY COMMENT. HOW ABOUT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. SO MORE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE ALSO DID NOT RAISE CONCERNS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE ON TO THE STATE TREASURER FIONA. WELCOME TO MEDICARE CABALLERO MEMBER NIELSEN AS WELL AS MEMBER ROSS I AM HERE TO EXPRESS CONCERNS ABOUT THE TIMING OF THE RENOVATIONS FOR THE CHEST ON REBUILDING YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED A LETTER PRETTY EXTENSIVE LETTER THAT. WAS SENT TO DGS DATED FEBRUARY FIRST- ELIMINATING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CONCERNS BUT DUE TO THE TIME CONSTRAINTS HERE I'M JUST GOING TO FOCUS ON THREE IN PARTICULAR. ONE DGS ESTIMATES A TOTAL RENOVATION PROJECT COST FOR THIS BUILDING WILL BE APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS A 43% INCREASE OVER THE ESTIMATED COST OF NINETY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET I HEARD MR KINNEY'S- PRIOR TESTIMONY THAT THE DESIGN BUILD IS GOING TO REDUCE COST YET. THE BUDGET FOR THIS BUILDING HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED BY 43% SINCE THE LAST BUDGET NUMBER TWO WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH DGS IN TWENTY NINETEEN ENDED TWENTY TWENTY WITH DESIGN CONCEPTS FOR THE REHABILITATION OF THIS DID NOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION OF THE PANDEMIC. AND THE NEW CHANGES THAT A DESIGN CHANGES THAT MAY BE NEEDED TO ACCOMMODATE MY FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY EMPLOYEES AND NUMBER THREE THE GOVERNOR ISSUED HIS STATE FACILITY LONG RANGE PLANNING STUDY. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. IS THAT THE TOP TWO NINE BILL THAT DEACON. LISTED AS THE WORST OF BUILDINGS THAT NEEDED TO BE RENOVATED. MISTER CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE NUMBER ONE BUILDING THAT IS ALMOST DONE. NUMBER TWO AND NUMBER THREE ON THE LIST ARE NOT PLANNED TO BE DONE ACCORDING TO OUR MEETING WITH DGS A COUPLE WEEKS AGO THAT THEY WERE GONNA BE USED TO SWING SPACE. NUMBER FOUR IS THE EDB BUILDING AND THE NUMBER FIVE IS THE ON ROUTE BUILDING AND THE PROPOSAL IS TO MOVE OUR EMPLOYEES IN TO THE BONNER ST BUILDING WHICH IS THE NUMBER THREE WORSE BUILDING. SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE CHARGERS OFFICE BEING THE NUMBER FIVE WAS BUILDING WILL BE INTO THE NUMBER THREE WORST BUILDING. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO. RENOVATE BUILDINGS NUMBER TWO AND NUMBER THREE THEN. IS THIS STUDY REALLY ACCURATE. AND THAT WAS. MY CONCERN IS MOVING US INTO A WORSE RATED BUILDING. NUMBER FOUR EDT THEIR NUMBER FOUR ON THE LIST PERHAPS. THE GOVERNOR SHOULD RENOVATE THE EDT BUILDING FIRST. GIVEN THE SITUATION THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WITH. FURLOUGHS WITH LAYOFFS. WITH DEFERRALS TO THE SCHOOLS I SMALL BUSINESSES SUFFERING IN THE STATE NOW IS NOT A GOOD TIMING. IN MY OPINION TO BE RENOVATING MY STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE BUILDING I'VE ALSO HAD MEMBERS IN THE STATE BUILDING FOR THIRTY. THIRTY FIVE YEARS AND THEY HAVE NOT EXPRESSED ANY CONCERNS WITH ANY OF THE LIFE OR SAFETY OR OTHER MEASURES- THAT- THAT WERE. DISCUSSED EARLIER SO I JUST THINK THE TIMING IS REALLY BAD- YOU KNOW PERHAPS WE CAN DISCUSS THIS IN A COUPLE OF YEARS DOWN THE ROAD. AGAIN MOVING US FROM THE NUMBER FIVE WORST BUILDING TO THE NUMBER THREE WORST BUILDING. IS NOT ACCEPTABLE I'M TO ME OR MY TEAM SO. THOSE ARE MY CONCERN HERE TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I'M GONNA SEE IF ANY FROM THE COMMITTEE. SENATE ROTH OR NOT BUT PERHAPS NOT I'M SURE SOMEBODY COULD ADDRESS THE SEQUENCING OF THE- RENOVATION PROJECTS FOR US BECAUSE I'M- TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE TREASURES- I REQUEST HERE IS AND I GUESS AT THE END IT IS NOT LEAVE US ALONE FOR RIGHT NOW AND GET TO US LATER AND- I GUESS THAT'S OKAY AS LONG AS THE- HVAC SYSTEM AND THE WATER SYSTEM IN THE ELEVATORS DON'T FAIL AND I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO. ADDRESS A DIFFERENT TO. SEQUENCING BUT ON THE BASE QUESTION. RENOVATING BUILDING NUMBER FIVE BEFORE WE RUN OF A BUILDING NUMBER TWO AND NUMBER THREE OR THREE OR FOUR. I'D LIKE FOR SOMEBODY TO ADDRESS THAT. I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO CENTER- SO JASON CAN AGAIN. D. I THINK THE I AM BACK UP A LITTLE BIT- TO GIVE SOME CONTEXT SO YES. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN DGS DID COMMISSION OUR CALL TO STILL BE CONDITION ASSESSMENTS. ASSEMBLY CONDITION ASSESSMENTS ARE- A TIME HONORED INDUSTRY METHODOLOGY ARE DOING RELATIVELY RAPID AND INEXPENSIVE REVIEWS- COMPARED TO THE EAST ABOUT FULL BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE STUDY I WISH YOU TAKE A LOT LONGER IN BEIN CONSIDERABLY EXPENSIVE. AND PROBLEMATIC WITH THE IN OCCUPIED BUILDINGS SO SCA'S OUR WAY OF GOING THROUGH ITS OWN CATALOGING. ISSUES IN THE BUILDING THEY DON'T CATALOG EVERYTHING BECAUSE WE CAN'T- AND IT'S MOSTLY A FINANCIAL ANALYSIS THEY'RE LOOKING AT WHAT IMMEDIATE WORK NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO KEEP THE BUILDING OPERATIONAL- AND WHAT SORT OF THINGS WOULD BE DONE IN OVER TEN YEAR TIME FRAMES. AND AGAIN TO KEEP THE BUILDING OPERATIONAL OR AT LEAST IN THE MEDIUM TERM NOT REALLY LOOKING AT A LONG LONG LONG TERM PROPOSITION AND A COMPARING THAT TO THE COST TO REPLACE THE BUILDING- AND SO IN THAT SENSE- WE DID DO A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF OUR ENTIRE PORTFOLIO AND BUILDINGS WERE RIGHT. HOWEVER THAT STUDY WAS NEVER INTENDED TO BE THE SOLE SOURCE OF DATA FOR THE SOLE BASIS FOR PRIORITIZATION OF RENOVATIONS. WE HAVE BUILDINGS THAT ARE PORTFOLIO- THAT WE HAVE HAD INFRASTRUCTURE STUDIES DONE. FOR YEARS ON A GROUP BEING ONE OF THEM- THERE ARE ALSO OTHER CONSIDERATIONS LIKE THE SEVERITY OF THE ISSUES AND SO- WHILE BOTH BUILDINGS NFCA MIGHT HAVE. HOUSES CEREALS YOU KNOW IT'S MUCH MORE SEVERE IN THE UNDER BUILDING- FIRE LIFE SAFETY ISSUES ARE MORE SEVERE AND THE ON THE BUILDING THAT THAT- YOU ALSO PASTIKAN CONSIDERATION THE HISTORICITY OF BUILDINGS FALL UNDERSTANDS OF THE AGE WHERE WOULD QUALIFY THE STORK CERTAINLY- THE HUNDRED BUILDING ALREADY GETTING IS- SQUARE. FOOTAGE IS THE OTHER BIG EAT- SEQUENCING PLAN WILL DESIGN TO. CENTER AROUND CONSULT. THE TO LET OUR EFFICIENCY ASKING THE THESE PROJECTS THEY'RE ALSO DESIGN. TO TRY TO MAKE MOVES- THE TREASURER'S OFFICE. BECAUSE OF THE- CAPITAL THE FALL. WE WOULD LIKE TO A INTO. THE BUILDING- BIKE IN THIS BY WE ONLY TEN WILL BE MOVING AND THEN RELOCATING BACK EVERYONE ELSE IS MOVING ONCE- TO AVOID MOVE COST TO AVOID DISRUPTION- SO IT WOULD BE EASY BUILDING FOR EXAMPLE- THAT IS IN THE SEQUENCING PLAN IT IS SLATED LATER. THAN THE UNDER BUILDING BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY IS IT'S NOT AS- IF THE CALLS- IN THAT SEAT IS LEFT IN THE LOWER RANKING THAN. NOTHING. IS- BY- THE SCHOOL FOOTAGE HERE AS A REAL WORK WE HAVE TO SWEAR OUT YOU NEED THE RAGE. ARE AND ON THE BACK IN WHICH AGAIN WERE TRY TO AVOID A DOING. ED'S ACTION THE TEN IN. RE RENOVATION WHICH IS ALSO ON AGENDA I WOULD BE COVERING NEXT- AND SO IT'S VERY MUCH SOMETHING THAT RT HAD A TO THE SEQUENCING PLAN. AND YOUR QUESTIONS UNDER. WHAT WHAT I THINK IT DOES CAN YOU BLOW THAT DOWN TO ABOUT THREE SENTENCES. THE BINDERS IN BUILDING RANKS HIGHER IN THE SCA'S BUT IS NOT IN BETTER SHAPE THAN UNDER HONORING IS IN WORSE SHAPE. THE SEQUENCING PLAN PRINCIPLES TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. MORE THAN JUST THE FCA'S AND B. BUT COMPLICATED MASS THAT WE DID A COUPLE OF THE SEQUENCING PLANNED- REALLY. HAS A BETTER CANDIDATE. FOR EARLY RENOVATION THE- AND ULTIMATELY BY UNDERSTAND AND ASKING BE SLOW HIGHER RANKINGS IN THE ABSENT- WILL BE- SERVICE SPACE BECAUSE CAMERA AND THE LONG TERM DISPOSITION UNDER BUILDINGS ARE STILL UP IN THE AIR WE MAY ACTUALLY BRING THEM. IT'S POSSIBLE WE SELDOM- I'M ACTUALLY WHAT THEY WILL TURN TO ADAPTIVE REUSE THE BEANS KRAUSE. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE THANK MANAGER. THINK THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IT WHAT IS THE TIME FRAME THAT YOU'RE ANTICIPATING THE END REBUILDING WILL TAKE. TO DO THE RENOVATION. GOOD QUESTION- SO MOST THE RENOVATIONS I BELIEVE ARE IT'S A ROUGHLY TWO AND A HALF YEAR TIME FRAME FOR THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL WORK- I BELIEVE I WANT TO SAY THIS WILL BE DONE IN TWENTY FIVE WHEN YOU FACTOR IN THE DESIGN WORK AS WELL- RIGHT AROUND THAT TIME FRAME I SHOULD SAY TO THE LONGER THESE GET PUSHED OFF OF THE MARKET COSTS GO UP. LAST YEAR THE PROJECT COST FOR ONE THING THEY ACTUALLY INCREASED ABOUT 7% PLUS OR MINUS- PROGRESIVE CUT INTO THAT AND REFUSED IT- BUT EVERY YEAR THE PROJECT. COSTS WILL GO UP ROUGHLY 527% AND THEN WHAT- WHAT LED TO THE 43% INCREASES IN PRICE. YES SO ORIGINALLY- THE PROJECT WAS. THE TRIGGER MONETARY CHU IS THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN RUNS IN BUDGET EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET WISE- THE LOWER COST ESTIMATE THAT WE HAD AND THEN- LAST YEAR IN THE BUDGET PROCESS BEFORE THE PROPOSAL WAS WITHDRAWN- V. PROJECTS COSTS THAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU ARE ARE WHAT WAS SHARED AND- AND SO THEY KNOW WHAT REALLY HAPPENED WAS AS WE WERE DIGGING INTO THE PROJECTS- A COUPLE THINGS OCCURRED ONE. THE BUILDING CONDITION THE MORE WE DUG AND THE MORE WE FOUND THAT WAS PHYSICALLY WRONG THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS- BUT I THINK IN FAIRNESS MORE FUNDAMENTALLY- THE PROJECT COSTS THAT WE USE TO BASE. THE INITIAL- IN ADDITION GAS ON- WAS THE LIBRARY RENDON WHICH DIRECTLY THIS FROM THE BUILDING COUNTRY BUILDINGS- WHEN WE DID OUR SITE DESIGNATIONS HONORING. UPDATED BUT THE COST ESTIMATES AND SAW THAT THEY WERE MARKEDLY DIFFERENT THAN BLACK RECORDS- WE WANT ANY KIND OF DUG INTO THAT PROJECT WHICH HAPPENED ABOUT FOURTEEN YEARS AGO- AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT THERE WAS ACTUALLY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORK THAT WAS ELECTED NOT TO BE DONE. IN THAT BUILDING FOR EXAMPLE IN OTHERS I WAS A FIVE RESTROOMS AND THEY THEY ARE UPDATED THREE- THEY WERE SELECTED AND- SOME OF THE CATEGORIES WHICH ARE CHANGES THEY MADE. THINGS THAT IN SOME CASES ARE ACTUALLY OKAY BECAUSE THAT BUILDING. HAS A NON OFFICE USE AND- IT WAS IT WAS FAR FAR LESS BAD SHAPE THAN THE REST OF THE BUILDING OTHER CASES WHERE YES I SUSPECT THAT IN FUTURE% BUDGETS WILL BE COMING BACK AND- IN ASKING FOR SUPPORT YOU. TO COMPLETE WHICH HAD BEEN DONE FOURTEEN YEARS AGO- SO THIS PROJECTS AND WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SORT OF- BUT IT'S MASSIVE STROKE DIFFERENCE I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST WAY OF PUTTING IT. ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE. WELL IT IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT THAT THE- A NEW. NOW AND BASED ON. THE WORK THAT WAS IN TWENTY FIFTH AND THAT. THERE WAS MORE. THERE WAS MORE OF AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO BRING IT UP TO THAT CURRENT STANDARDS AT THIS POINT MAVERICK I'M JUST NOT SURE WHAT. WHY IT WOULD IF YOU IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT M. A METHODOLOGY. OF BEGINI IS DESIGN BUILD- IT'S A IT'S A METHODOLOGY DESIGNED TO GET YOU UP QUICKER PROJECT. FOR LESS COST AND YET IT WENT UP 43% AND SO TO ME THAT DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE UNLESS SHE GOT INTO THE PROJECT AND YOU REALIZED IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT MORE THAN THAT AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO. REPLACE OR REDUCE. A LOT MORE THAN WE THOUGHT. YEAH THAT'S THAT'S FAIR. THAT'S CERTAINLY THAT'S CERTAINLY PART OF WHAT HAPPENED- BUT I GUESS MAYBE TO MAKE IT. A LITTLE MORE. DIRECT WHEN WE ESTIMATED THE PROJECT COSTS AT THE VERY BEGINNING NOW THAT THERE WAS NO- BASIS THAT WE HAD WE WERE WE ARE COMING UP WITH THE RENOVATION COSTS THAT WE THOUGHT WAS APPROPRIATE. THERE IS A BUILDING PROJECT ACROSS THE STREETS LITERALLY ACROSS THE STREET THAT WAS RENOVATED- AND SO WE USE THOSE PROJECT COSTS AS THE PROXY MEASURE OR THE ORIGINAL RENOVATION. AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT WAS AN ERROR ON OUR PART TO DO SO BECAUSE THE SCOPES FOR JUST SUCH A MISALIGNED SO NOT ONLY. DID WE FUNDAMENTALLY. PROVIDE THE WRONG PROJECT BASIS IN THE BEGINNING IN TWENTY EIGHT TO NINETEEN. WHICH WE OWN UP TO IN THE HEARING LAST YEAR- BUT ALSO AS WE INVESTIGATE THE BUILDING THERE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE. WRONG WITH IT AND WE HAD JUST. GOT IT. THAT'S I'M VERY DIRECT AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT. I THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE DISCUSSION THAT NEEDS TO BE HAD AND I WOULD. RECOMMEND THAT THE STATE TREASURER HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE- WITH DTS- BUT THIS IS A HOLD. OPEN ITEM SO WHAT WE WILL DO THAT. THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT STATE TREASURER HAS ONE FINAL COMMENT TO MAKE. YEAH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR YOU KNOW- I WAS ON THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW A LITTLE BIT BOUT THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION BUILDING AT FOUR FIFTY AND- THEY HAD SCAFFOLDING UP THERE FOR MANY YEARS IT'S STILL THERE BECAUSE THE WINDOWS WERE POPPING OUT- WE HAD FLOODING ISSUES WHEN IT RAINED IT WENT UP THE RAIN WOULD COME DOWN THE STAIRWELLS WE HAD. PLANTS GROWING OUT OF THE WATER FOUNTAIN AND SO WE REALLY WERE ASKING THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BACKBENCH TO PLEASE PRIORITIZE THAT BUILDING TO RENOVATE IT AND THEY WENT OUT WITH THE STUDY AND THE STUDY CAME OUT WITH THEIR TOP TWENTY NINE BUILDINGS THAT NEEDED TO BE RENOVATED AND THE BE- EACH BUILDING WAS NOT ON THAT LIST AND EVEN THOUGH I THINK THAT BUILDINGS REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN. IN THE TOP TEN BUT IT WASN'T AND SO WE ARE ALL GOING BY THAT STUDY THAT THE GOVERNOR PUT OUT AND SO MY ISSUE IS IF YOU'RE GOING TO ISSUE A STUDY PUT IT OUT THERE USE IT AS A MEANS FOR ALLOCATIONS WAR PRIORITIES AND THEN NOT GO BUY IT OR NOT RENOVATED THEN THAT'S STUDY REALLY PROBABLY NEEDS TO BE REDONE BECAUSE IT IS VERY DISINGENUOUS TO PUT IT INTO A BUILDING THAT IS RANKED WORSE WHEN EVERYBODY AROUND THE CAPITAL IS USING THAT STUDY AS THE STUDY THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE PRIORITIZED SO- THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT- IS VERY DISCONCERTING. TO ME AND IS VERY VERY HARD. FOR ME TO SELL TO MY STAFF. UNDERSTOOD AND IT MAKES A OF WHOLE HECK OF A LOT OF SAN AND- I'M- I'M SENSITIVE TO THAT- SO. I GUESS MY E. WE WILL THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM AS I SAID THERE'S A LOT MORE DISCUSSION TO BE HAD AND- HI I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOUR OFFICE GETS HEARD AND THAT WE WEIGH IN ON ON. ON WHETHER THE RENOVATION OF THIS BUILDING IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY- GIVEN EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE'RE WORKING ON SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY AND YOUR INPUT AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT TO BE- REBUILDING IS A DISASTER AND- THE FACT THAT IT DIDN'T END UP ON ANY LIST IS. IS A IS OF CONCERN BECAUSE THEN YOU START QUESTIONING THE LIST IN THE FIRST PLACE SO. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS. AND THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM SO WILL- WE'LL MOVE ON WE'LL GO BACK TO ITEM NUMBER. TWENTY TWENTY ONE. YES ITEM NUMBER TWENTY TWO WHICH IS THE SACRAMENTO REGION GREGORY BATESON BUILDING RENOVATION. SURE FROM THE DEPARTMENT AGAIN. MADAM CHAIR JUST- ONE TINY RECOGNITION WOULD BE REBUILDING FOR THE ENTRY WAS UNDERSTUDIED WHICH IS RANKED SIXTEENTH IN THE FCS- SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN RIGHT AROUND THERE. ARE SO THE GREGORY BATESON BUILDING IS ON THE OTHER THREE BUILDING PROJECTS IN FRONT OF YOU- ANOTHER HISTORIC BUILDINGS ACTUALLY WON THE STATE'S FIRST IN TERMS OF THE SUSTAINABLE BUILDING- ISN'T SLATED FOR RENOVATIONS SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN ARTS AND. USUALLY COMES IN PLAN WAS PUBLISHED. LIKE I'M- IT WAS A- BY THE SENATE. DEBATE IN TWENTY EIGHT- AND THEN YEAR. IT WAS APPROVED FOR THIS FINAL PHASE BY THE SUBCOMMITTEE OR WE WITHDREW THE-BUT YOU THE PROJECT FOR CONSIDERATION. THE CURRENT TENANTS WILL BE OUT RELOCATED TO THE CORPORATE ALAMEDA BUILDING WHICH IS FINISHING CONSTRUCTION NOW- AND- WILL RESULT IN THE BASIN BUILDING BEGINNING TO BE VACATED THIS SUMMER. LAKE UNRUH AND LIKE RESOURCES WHICH ALL TESTIFIED TO THE MINUTE- WEDNESDAY CREATED BE- WELL THE ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY READ THE BIG BUILDING- IT HAS SIMILAR SORTS OF ISSUES- IT'S YOU THE HONOR BUILDING IT NEEDS OF THE NAY MAJOR BUILDING SYSTEMS REPLACED AGAIN ELEVATORS PLUMBING HEATING VENTILATION AND- AIR CONDITIONING ELECTRICAL TELECOM SECURITY. IT ALSO HAS SOME CRITICAL FIRE LIFE SAFETY ISSUES BUT NOT AS SEVERE AS THE ON REBUILDING- AND- THE BASIN BUILDING LIKE ON YOUR HAS A DIFFERENT TYPE OF WATER INTRUSION BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY MORE SIGNIFICANT- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE FOUND AS WE WERE DIGGING INTO THIS PROJECT IS NOT ONLY WAS THE ORIGINAL CONSTRUCTION DESIGN. ADEQUATE BUT AS WE STARTED CALLING CARDS THE EXTERIOR TESTED BUT THE- THE CONSTRUCTION WAS NOT EVEN DOWN TO DESIGN- AND THERE'S VERY LITTLE ACTION IN REAL WATERPROOFING ON THE EXTERIOR BUILDING. WHICH IS A VERY BAD- BLOOD ALL OVER END OF THE CONSTRUCTION AGAIN HELLO LABEL IT WILL. IN IT KEEP WITH THE DOES GUIDANCE ON COAST WILL BE BILLED. OBJECTS SLIGHTLY- LARGE THAN A GROUP I WILL CRAVE ABOUT EIGHT HOW J. AGAIN NOT INCLUDING DOWN BENEFITS. IT WILL ALSO PROJECT LABOR AND THE CAN YOU WORKFORCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BERMAN FINANCE. SACRAMENTO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE HAVE NO COMMENT AT THIS TIME. ABOUT THE L. A. L. SORT OF BORED LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE ALSO HAVE NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE THIS IS AN ITEM. OKAY HERE TO THIS IS THIS IS A RECOMMENDED FOR APPROVAL SO WE'LL BE TAKING UP OUR VOTES LATER THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT PRESENTATION. WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY FOUR SACRAMENTO REGION RESOURCES BUILDING RENOVATION SINCE THE BUILDING RENOVATION DAY. IT IS THE LAST TIME YOU HEAR ME I PROBLEMS- BUT AGAIN JASON NEEDS YES- SO A LOT OF MATERIAL HAS BEEN COVERED I'LL JUST BE BREEDS- ANOTHER HISTORIC BUILDING- BASED ON OUR RESEARCH STUDIES OPERATIVE INSTIGATION. AND THAT'S THE AS THEY ALL KIND OF CONSPIRED TOGETHER THIS IS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANTLY DIVISION BUILDING AND OUR PORTFOLIO IT WAS. FIRST CONSTRUCTED BY THE STATE AFTER WORLD WAR TWO LIKE THE OTHER ONES- THE LEGISLATURE WAS BEGAN IN JULY TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT WAS WITHDRAWN LAST YEAR AFTER BEING APPROVED BY THIS COMMITTEE- THE TENANTS IN THIS BUILDING WILL BE- THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE CURRENTS. I'M SORRY WHO WHO BE GOT CERTIFICATE BUT- THE P. TEN THE BUILDING OCCUPANTS WILL MOVE TO A NEW NATURAL RESOURCES BUILDING BECAUSE WE ARE GREAT WITH NAMES. ARE IN THAT BUILDING WILL BE CONSTRUCTED IN JULY- LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE AGAIN MAJOR BUILDING SYSTEM- REPLACEMENT REQUIREMENTS- I SHOULD ALSO SERVICE BUILDING HAS A SEVERE SEISMIC EFFICIENCY. WHICH WILL ADDRESS WAS ACTION REQUIRE US REPLACING THE ENTIRE EXTERIOR SKIN OF THE BUILDING- THIS BUILDING PROJECT. WILL HAVE A- HE MEANT AS WELL THE COMMITTEE WORK FORCING- AND IT IS AT TO GROW OVER FOUR. FIVE JOB AND CAL AS A RESULT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE- O. F. I'M SUCH A MAN AS PART OF FINANCE NO COMMENT AT THIS TIME. VERY MUCH ABOUT THE OHIO. SO TO WORK WITH THE L. A. WE ALSO HAVE NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD AT THIS POINT THANK YOU VERY MUCH SAYING NO. COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ITEM IS RECOMMENDED FOR APPROVAL AS WELL AND SO WE'LL TAKE THAT UP AT A LATER TIME WILL MOVE ON ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY FIVE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INFORMATION ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY FIVE IS THE- SCTV S. C. INFRASTRUCTURE ASSESSMENT AND FACILITY DEVELOPMENT. WHICH IS THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY- EVSC. WE WILL HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THIS IS NANCY UNDER. ARCMINUTES GENERAL SERVICES THIS REQUEST IS FOR A ONE TIME BUDGET AUGMENTATION OF FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL BONDS AND ONE POINT THREE MILLION IN SERVICE FOR GOLFING KIND OF FLOORING. I REQUEST IS DEFINED YEAR FIVE OF OUR DGS ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE FIVE YEAR INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT PLAN AND TO CONTINUE PERFORMING INSTALLATIONS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE SERVICE EQUIPMENT AT STATE OWNED AND LEASED FACILITIES WHICH IS CRITICAL TO MEETING CALIFORNIA'S TRANSPORTATION AND GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS. THE PURPOSE OF THESE BONDS IS ESSENTIALLY TEN STAR ALEXIAD VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS FOR BOTH POLICE. AN EMPLOYEE YES. I WILL BE RIGHT OUT A POOR CALL. FOR VERY GOOD THANK I MET YEAH I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU GUYS HAVE HEARD FINANCING YEAH. ABOUT THE L. A. O.'S OFFICE. SORT OF BORED LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE DID NOT RAISE CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL. VERY GOOD- HI I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IF I COULD- THIS IS AN ITEM THAT IS BEING REQUESTED TO BE HOLD HELD OPEN BUT I'M JUST WERE WONDERING IF YOU COULD ADDRESS TWO ISSUES THAT- THAT HAVE ME A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ONE IS. THAT THE IMPACT OF TELEWORKING- DURING THIS PANDEMIC. I THINK WE'VE LEARNED SOME LESSONS ABOUT THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO WORK FROM HOME AND GET- TESTS DONE THAT ARE REQUIRED- AND I'M WONDERING IF. IT MAKES SENSE FOR US TO LOOK AT. CONTRACTING THE AB STATIONS THE AB CHARGING STATIONS RATHER THAN MAKING A STATE INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MAY BE OBSOLETE IN JUST A FEW YEARS. SO I THINK ARE YOU RAISE A VALID QUESTION THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS I WANT TO MENTION IN RESPONSE TO THAT ONE IS THAT WE ARE IN IN. ANTICIPATING AN INCREASE IN ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING NEEDS IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE LIKELY CONTINUING TO WORK AND SOME REMOTE WORKING CAPACITY AND THE REASON FOR THAT BEING THAT MOST RECENT EXECUTIVE ORDER WHEREBY WE ANTICIPATE TRANSITIONING TO. ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE INTHE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITHOUT AGGRESSIVE TARGET WE ANTICIPATE A NEED FOR INCREASED CHARGING STATION SERVING BOTH OUR FLEET AND- WORKPLACE. IN ADDITION TO YOUR YOUR OTHER QUESTION IN TERMS OF ALTERNATIVES WE ARE LOOKING VERY VERY CLOSELY AT OTHER ALTERNATIVES AT THIS POINT THOSE ARE TURNER GETS AND BUSINESS MODELS ARE STILL EMERGING IN THE INDUSTRY AND NONE ARE RISING UP TO THE SURFACE AS BEING COST EFFICIENT. FOR US AT THIS TIME HOWEVER. ANKLES TO IT AND- WILL BE CONTINUING TO RESEARCH AND OPTIONS WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE MOST COST EFFICIENT OPTION TESTER THAT NEEDS OF BOTH THE FLEET WILL WORK PLACE IN THIS AREA AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT AT SOME FUTURE TIME. SOME OF THOSE CHARGING AS A SERVICE MODEL MAY BECOME MORE APPROPRIATE THAN STATE OWNED INFRASTRUCTURE. AT THIS POINT WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PLANS FOR STATE INFRASTRUCTURE IS STILL REQUIRED AS A BASELINE MINIMUM DISTURB THE FLEET AND EMPLOYEE NEEDS IN THIS AREA. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT I APPRECIATE I GUESS I'M GONNA MAKE MY- MY STANDARD COMMENT WHICH FROM. I MAKE IN YOU KNOW NOBODY LISTENS TO HIM BUT I MAKE IT ANYWAY WHICH- USE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED WE NEEDED WE NEEDED PEOPLE THEIR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND I GET THE CONVERSION TO AN ELECTRIC ALL ELECTRIC VEHICLE IS GREENER BUT IN THE END YOU STILL HAVE TO PRODUCE CITY. AND- I KEEP HOPING THAT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE MAJOR INVESTMENTS. INTO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION INTO THE SUBURBS AND RURAL CALIFORNIA SO THAT WE CAN GET PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS AND TAKING. A MODE OF TRANSPORTATION THAT THAT ACTUALLY WILL WORK FOR THEM RIGHT NOW IT DOESN'T DOESN'T WORK AT ALL- SO I DO APPRECIATE THE- THE NEED FOR INCREASED CHARGING STATIONS BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE WE OUGHT TO BE INVESTING IN. IN PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IF THERE'S EVER A PLACE WHERE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION WORKS SACRAMENTO- THERE ARE LOTS OF WAYS TO GET AROUND AND IF WE CAN GET PEOPLE INTO THE DOWNTOWN AREA WITHOUT BRINGING A CAR THAT WOULD BE THE BEST AND WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO MOVE STATE EMPLOYEES AROUND AS WELL AND GIVE THEM. FREE ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS PART OF THE EMPLOYMENT. BENEFITS AND HOPEFULLY HAVE TO BUILD LESS PARKING LOTS OF AND BILL LESS PARKING LOTS AND MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO I'VE MADE MY POINT AND I APPRECIATE THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND WILL BE LOOKING AT IT AT ANOTHER TIME. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY ITEM ISSUE NUMBER. TWENTY SIX WHICH IS THE WORKLOAD BCP. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MY NAME'S JUSTIN HOWARD AND I AM THE DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR FISCAL POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY- FOR YOU TO DATE WE HAVE. HER WORKLOAD PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY IS REQUESTING FOR POSITIONSIN A MILLION AND ONE MILLION DOLLARS SIX HUNDRED FORTY NINE THOUSAND OF WHICH IS GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY TWO AND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SIX THOUSAND ONGOING TO FIND AND MANAGE EXISTING AND NEW WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH OVERSIGHT MANAGEMENT STATE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS.

THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY TO APPROPRIATELY PROVIDE STATEWIDE POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND CRITICAL INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT OF THE VERY SKEWED ENTITIES THAT RECORDS TO OUR AGENCY AS WELL AS ESTABLISHED THE STATEWIDE EQUITY AND INCLUSION FRAMEWORK FOR HIRING IN GERMAN STATE DEPARTMENTS MUST FOLLOW WITH ME TODAY IS A LOT OF TROUT SHE IS A SPECIAL CONSULTANT. TO THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY WAS BROUGHT ON TO ASSIST OUR EFFORTS AT SURROUNDING RACIAL EQUITY AND INCLUSION EITHER OF US ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE WE HAVE. REGARDING THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BERMAN OF. BRIAN WHITE TO FIND BUT NOTHING ADAMS PHOTO. THANK YOU HOW ABOUT THE ALLEGED ANALYST'S. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAD OVER THE L. A. O. US SIMILAR WE HAVE NO ASPEN COMMENTS ABOUT THIS PROPOSED THANK YOU RIGHT. THERE ARE NO NO QUESTIONS ON THE SIDE SIR THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM AND SO- WE WILL SEE THIS BACK AT A LATER DATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY SEVEN WHICH IS A STATE WIDE DATA STRATEGY. THANK YOU MADAM. CHAIR ONCE AGAIN JUSTIN HOW'RE AT THE SECRETARY FOR FISCAL POLICY ADMINISTRATION GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY THE NEXT ITEM IN FRONT OF YOU. IS RELATED TO THE STATEWIDE DATA STRATEGY THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCIES REQUESTING THREE POSITIONS FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND I'M GOING. TO FACILITATE AND SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATEWIDE DATA STRATEGY AND CONDUCT EVALUATIONS FOR COME OUT CENTER. EXCELLENCE ON IMPLEMENTING A STATEWIDE DATA STRUCTURES YOU WILL LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR STATE DEPARTMENTS TO DELIVER BETTER OUTCOMES TO THE RESIDENTS THEY SERVE BY BREAKING DOWN DATA BARRIERS. THE STATEWIDE DATA STRATEGY WILL HELP IMPROVE STATE DEPARTMENTS ACCESS TO DATA AND STANDARDIZED DATA MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE PRACTICES. AN INCREASE DEPARTMENTS ABILITIES. TO USE DATA ANALYTICS ALL OF WHICH WILL LEAD TO BETTER DECISION MAKING. AND RESOURCE ALLOCATIONS BY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND POLICY MAKERS IN THE FUTURE WITH ME TODAY AND JOIN ONE OF OUR OLDEST STATES. AT THE STATEWIDE SHE DATA HOLLISTER AND SHE SHE WILL BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT THE UPCOMING AND SHE CAN HELP ME ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND TALK ABOUT THE STATEWIDE DATA STRATEGY. FOR DETAIL. IF SO DESIRED. HELLO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AS A SOCIETY WE YEAH. YOU'RE ON. AS THIS WE- TESTER GOVERNMENTS WITH SOME OF OUR MOST COMPLEX CHALLENGES JUST A FEW OF THESE INCLUDE EDUCATING OUR CHILDREN BALANCING PUBLIC SAFETY IN WITH SOCIAL JUSTICE AND PROVIDING SERVICES TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE THIS MEANS WE CANNOT AFFORD TO GUESS HOW WELL OUR SERVICES ARE WORKING THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS DEPEND ON US KNOWING WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T WHICH IS WHY WE NEED ROBUST DATA AND EVIDENCE BASED APPROACHES TO ENSURE THAT OUR PROGRAMS ARE IN SERVICES ARE WORKING IN THE WAY THAT WE EXPECT THEM TO WORK. BETTER USE OF DAYTON EVIDENCE BY STATE EMPLOYEES AND LEADERSHIP CAN IMPROVE OUR DECISIONS ARE SERVICES AND ULTIMATELY THE OUTCOMES AND LYFT OF OUR RESIDENTS. GIVEN THE NEED FOR BETTER USE OF DAYTON EVIDENCE WE STRUCTURE THE DATA STRATEGY AROUND THE ANALOGY THAT IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATE THE LANDSCAPE. DID A LANDSCAPE YOU NEED TO INTENTIONALLY BUILT THE ROADS CROSSED THE RULES OF THE RATES AND BUILD. THOSE THAT DRIVER'S. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT BUT IN SHORT OUR VIRTUAL DATA ROLLED WORK WORLD REQUIRES THE KAREN PLANNING THAT WE PUT INTO THE ROADS AND BRIDGES OF THE REAL WORLD. OTHERWISE WE'LL CONTINUE TO ASK OUR LEADERS AND OUR STATE PLACE TO NAVIGATE THE DANCE DATA LANDSCAPE WITHOUT A ROADMAP. OR EVEN A COMPASS. PERFECT DEPART OF FINANCE. BUT I WAS ABLE TO HOLD THE FINANCE YEAH WE HAVE- WASHINGTON'S OLD RECALL BOOKS ON. THANK YOU HOW ABOUT LEGISLATIVE AND OFFICE. YES- THE L. A. L. SIMILAR WE HAVE NO SPECIFICALLY OR ISSUES WITH THIS PROPOSAL THANKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BOB I GOT TO BE REAL HONEST WITH YOU I DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT YOU JUST SAID IN REGARDS TO. ADD DATA MANAGEMENT WHAT WHAT YOU WOULD USE IT FOR ME JUST SAY THAT THAT DATA FOR DATA SAKE. DOESN'T DO MUCH FOR US- THE DATA HAS TO BE RELATIVE TO WHATEVER IT IS THAT- YOU'RE TRYING TO ANALYZE AND SO I'M JUST NOT SURE CAN YOU TELL ME. WHAT THE STATEWIDE DATA STRATEGY ISN'T AND HOW GIVE ME A PRACTICAL APPLICATION FOR HOW IT WOULD BE USED BECAUSE IT JUST SEEMS TO ME LIKE. MAN I'M VERY CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT. WE ARE GROWING GOVERNMENT EVERY DAY. AND EVERY TIME WE DO THAT IT COST THE TAX PAYERS AND AT SOME POINT WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THE MOST NECESSARY THINGS THAT PEOPLE REALLY WANT DONE. THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET THE DRIVER'S LICENSES THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET UNEMPLOYMENT WHEN THEY WHEN THEY'RE UNEMPLOYED THEY WANT TO GET DISABILITY IF THEY'RE HURT SO THERE'S SOME REAL PRACTICAL INTERCHANGES WITH THE PUBLIC UPDATE YOUR ABSOLUTE RIGHT THEY NEED THEY NEED A GOOD ROAD. BUT BEYOND THAT ON ME YOU KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE PUT OBLIGATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS WE PUT ON BUSINESSES AND PEOPLE AND I JUST I'M I'M CAUTIOUS ABOUT JUST GROWING THINGS BECAUSE WE HAVE DATA. SAID YOU COULD TELL ME EGGS. TELL ME A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT WHAT YOU ENVISION. OUT OF THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE AND HOW IT'S GOING TO HELP TO RUN. TO DIRECT- EITHER THE AIRPORT OR THE WATER BOARD'S DECISIONS OR OR THE KINDS OF YOU KNOW DELTA SMELT IT THINGS THAT ARE THAT ARE KIND OF OVER FOUR DOUBLE HOUSING HOMELESSNESS HOW HOW HOW IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING GOING TO AID IN THAT. SURE THOSE ARE WONDERFUL QUESTIONS THANK YOU- AND SECRETARY- SO FOR EXAMPLE- BUT YOU. I LOVE THE QUESTION ABOUT DATA MANAGEMENT DATA GOVERNANCE I'LL GIVE A VERY SPECIFIC EXAMPLES SO HOW HOW SHOULD THE STATE COLLECT RACE AND ETHNICITY DATA FOR EXAMPLE OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND- GENDER IDENTITY. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE COLLECTING THAT CONSISTENTLY ACROSS DEPARTMENTS AND ACROSS PROGRAM AREAS SO THAT WHEN WE COMPARE. RATES OF EQUITY OR PARTICIPATION ACROSS APPLES TO APPLES RIGHT NOW WE DON'T WE DON'T. NECESSARILY DO THAT CONSISTENTLY AND THERE HASN'T TO DATE BEEN A GROUP THAT HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON SURE INSURANCE. STEP BY- ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS ENSURE. WE HAVE THE RIGHT JOB. FOR AGE RIGHT AS AS MORE DATA BECOMES AVAILABLE WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN USE IT CONSISTENTLY AND WELL AND SO DO WE HAVE THE RIGHT JOB CLASSIFICATIONS IN PLACE SO WE'RE REVISITING THE JOB CLASSIFICATIONS TO ENSURE THAT OUR OUR VARIOUS PROGRAMS. HI YOUR DATA SKILLS THAT THEY NEED TO ACTUALLY USE THAT DATA WELL TO MAKE BETTER PROGRAM DECISIONS WHETHER IT'S HOW THERE ARE YOU PROVIDING SERVICES IN DMV WILL BY THE WAY DON'T HAVE IS A GREAT EXAMPLE WHERE THEY'RE TRYING TO BUILD OUT THEIR DATA. PROGRAM I NEED HELP. RETAINING AND HIGHER. STAFF ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS YOUR YOU HAVE IF THEY DON'T THE RIGHT DATA I'M HERE SO THAT CAN WORK WITH IT THEY DON'T LESS AFFECT SO WE STARTED A PROGRAM CALLED THE DAY TOOLS FOR THEN SURE ARE DATA STAFF AROUND HAD TO TOOLS AND UNDERSTAND WHY AND HOW THEY CAN USE THEM ACTIVELY SO THOSE ARE JUST A FEW OF- SPACE PROGRAMS WERE ON AND PROGRAM IS CALLED THE ACT WAS PROGRAM SO. LET'S SAY ONE TO GOES OUT TO PURCHASE DATA FOR EXAMPLE SATELLITE IMAGERY HOW WE LEVERAGE THAT THAT DATA HER JUST ACROSS THE STATE SO IT'S NOT HAPPENING INDIVIDUALLY THAT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF IT IS DAMAGING DATA GOVERNANCE TO ENSURE THAT IT ONE DEPARTMENT GOES OUT TO BUY DATA THAT THERE MAY BE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION OTHER DEPARTMENT YET SO WE'RE ONLY BUYING IT ONCE I AM HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE BALK OR ANSWER MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT ONE LAST FINAL EXAMPLE AND SOMETHING I'VE BEEN PERSONALLY INVOLVED IT IS ENSURING THAT AS WE DO BUILD OUT YOUR DATA SYSTEMS ONE OF THEM BEING THE HOMELESS DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM. ONE THAT'S UNDER PLANNING IS CRADLE. TO CAREER TO MAKE SURE THAT. THERE USING APPROACHES ARE. THE THOSE EFFORTS SO. I GUESS THE AND- IS INDIA. AND TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE WE HAVE STATURE COULD NOT BUT AROUND EIGHT AT. IMPRINT IMPRESSIONS GET A MAN'S MAN. HAVEN'T HAD THAT. AND SO BUILDING ON THAT KNOWLEDGE THE ROLE OF THE CIO. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE UNDER THE CLINGER COHEN ACT AND WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF WORK DEVELOP AROUND THAT. THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE ARE FOUNDATIONS OF EVIDENCE BASED POLICY CREATED THE ROLE OF THIS CBO AT THE AGENCY LEVEL AND THE FEDERAL SPACE JUST IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. SO THE NEWER ROLE. IN AND FIGURE OUT- WHERE IT CAN HAVE THE MOST LEVERAGE AND HELP IS ACTUALLY IS PART OF WHAT WE WILL BE WORKING. THE LEAD TO VERY HELPFUL AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE- THAT THE DETAILED EXPLANATION AS WELL AS THE- THE COMMITMENT TO WORKINGACROSS DEPARTMENTS SO THAT THERE'S SOME CONSISTENCY AND HOW DATA IS COLLECTED AND I'M AND HOW IT'S USED AT THE MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME- SO I. YES SENATE ROTH BUT THE MANAGER THIS IS VERY INTERESTING YOU KNOW. PART OF OUR PROBLEM IN THE STATE IS THE STATE IS SO LARGE WITH. THE NUMBER OF AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS AND- SOME OF THEM OF COURSE ARE DEALING WITH DATA THAT. TO THE EXTENT IT'S PERSONALIZED IS PROTECTED BUT- REALLY BAD CAN BE CLEANED SO THAT THE DATA IS UTILIZED SO HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET YOUR ARMS AROUND THIS IN TERMS OF OTHER AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS WHERE. THE EDT FOR EXAMPLE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY GETTING INFORMATION FROM CDCR IN ORDER TO MAKE TO RECONCILE PAYMENTS UNDER FRAUDULENT OR NON FRAUDULENT THE- THE OF OTHER AGENCIES MAY NEED INFORMATION THAT ARE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. AGENCY HAS SOME OF WHICH IS PROTECTED BUT PROBABLY CAN MAY BE MADE ON PROTECTED IN ORDER FOR THE USES THAT ARE IMPORTANT. HOW DO YOU GET YOUR ARMS AROUND THAT BECAUSE OF COURSE. SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T KNOW GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS DON'T KNOW AS- SECRETARY RUMSFELD ONCE SAID YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW. CHIU LATELY I TALK ABOUT A DATA FALLS INTO A FEW BUCKETS ONE THE DATA WE KNOW WE HAVE YET WE HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT HOW TO INSTRUMENT IT SO IT'S AT THE READY THAT'S ONE SET OF PROBLEMS- DATA THAT WE KNOW WE NEED BUT WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE'S RECENT ACQUISITION OF SATELLITE IMAGERY THAT'S ANOTHER AND THEN THE DATA THAT. WE- THE QUESTIONS WE HAVE BUT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THEY DID EXIST OR WE HAVE TO CREATE IT IN EACH OF THOSE CREATES. A DIFFERENT SORT OF PROBLEM TO YOUR BROADER QUESTION OF HOW TO COORDINATE AND PUT OUR HANDS AROUND THIS. THAT'S WHERE WERE REVAMPING IN LAUNCHING SOMETHING HEALTHY AND GET COLD CAL DATA COMMUNITIES THAT'S GOING TO WORK TO CREATE SYSTEMATIC GOVERNANCE AROUND IT BUT IT ALSO MEANS I'M PARTNERING WITH THE CONTROL AGENCIES LIKE C. AND DIGESTER ENSURE THAT. WHEN WE HAVE DATA ISSUES THAT TOUCH THEIR SYSTEMS WE HAVE A POINT OF CONTROL. I'M ON THE ON THE NOTION OF- DID EXCHANGE WE ARE WORKING ON SOMETHING CALLED INTERAGENCY DATA EXCHANGE AGREEMENT WHICH I BELIEVE I SPOKE WITH THIS GROUP- ABOUT A YEAR AGO. AND WHAT THAT IS DOINGIS IT'S CREATING A SINGLE- UMBRELLA AGREEMENT FOR DATA EXCHANGE TO NEGOTIATE THE EXCHANGE OF. PERSONAL INFORMATION TO ENSURE THAT THAT IS. LAWFUL AND APPROPRIATE. BUT IT'S ALSO DONE SECURELY AND CONSISTENTLY AND- THAT IS ACTUALLY AN ADMINISTRATIVE- TOOL THAT WE ONE YEAR SO FOR EXAMPLE NORMALLY NEGOTIATING THESE KINDS OF DATA EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS. I'VE SEEN THEM TAKE UP TO TEN YEARS. BUT OFTEN YOU'LL SEE ANYWHERE FROM A YEAR TO TWO YEARS. EIGHTEEN MONTHS FOR. BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS TO. AGREEMENTS AND WHY WE'RE SCHEME THE WAR AND THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY WHERE WITH AN AGENCY THEY ADOPTED A SINGLE CREAM AND FOR DOING THAT DATA EXCHANGE WHEN THEY ADOPTED THAT GREENMAN. THEIR TYPICAL NEGOTIATIONS OF DATA EXCHANGE WENT FROM I BELIEVE IT WAS- ON A YEAR AND A HALF TO SEVENTY NINE DAYS. SO WE NEED THOSE ADMINISTRATIVE TOOLS THE FACT THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD COMMONDATA EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS AND LANGUAGE IS A TOOL THAT WE NEED TO BUILD OUT AND SUPPORT. ON THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS SOLVE THE CULTURAL PIECES AND THAT'S WHERE WE WERE LYING COMMUNITIES AND CREATING- NETWORKS OF- DATA AND DATA ADVOCATES ACROSS THE STATE AND THIS IS SOMETHING CERTAINLY THAT I WORKED ON IN SAN FRANCISCO WHEN I WAS THE CHIEF DATA OFFICER THERE. ON YOUR FIRST POINT ABOUT DATA QUALITY THAT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF WE'RE INTRODUCING EMPLOYEES ACROSS THE STATE TO DATA QUALITY TOOLS. AND HOW TO USE THEM WHILE AND EFFECTIVELY AND INCORPORATE THEM INTO PROGRAMMING INCLUDE PLAYBOOKS AROUND THAT SO IN SHORT WE HAVE TO HAVE SHARED RESOURCES AND SHARED APPROACHES. BUT THE NETWORK OF. PEOPLE IN COMMUNITIES SPREAD AND DRIVE ADOPTION OF THOSE TWO ALL OF THE THINGS WE HAVE NO HAD. IN THE DATA SPACE. BROUGH CRISTINA LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING OF YOUR PROGRESS AS WE MOVE ALONG THANK YOU VENTURE. I AGREE I THINK IT IT COULD BE REALLY FASCINATING AND THAT YOUR YOUR- YOUR EXPLANATION MAKES A MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING MORE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS AS WELL. HI THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM SO WE WILL DO SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE- DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY EIGHT STABILIZE CRITICAL SERVICES AND IT INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR THIS IS AMY TOM GRAHAM THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND JOINING ME IT'S- JUST CLINCHER POWELL WHO IS THE CHIEF STRATEGIST- FOR TECHNOLOGY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO JUST AND IF YOU COULD. TURN ON YOUR CAMERA AND SAY HELLO- WE CAN MAKE SURE BOTH THE MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CAN SEE BOTH OF US. THANK YOU DIRECTOR TOM MY- JUSTIN TO. AND THAT- DIRECTOR COMMENTED ON THE SHE TRIED AT THE TECH. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US TODAY. IN THE BANK YOU JUST- IN FOR OF YOUR ARE- BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSED ON TO PARTICULAR- ITEM ONE IS TO CALIFORNIA ON THE TECHNOLOGY IS REQUESTING A SEVENTEEN POSITION AND- LITTLE BIT OVER ELEVEN. BILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND FOR THE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- AND THE SUBSEQUENT- YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE WITH ABOUT NINE MILLION DOLLAR AND THEN THERE FOR AFTER SIX MILLION DOLLAR ON GOING TO INVEST IN THE PROACTIVE MEASURES IN STABILIZING THE CRITICAL SERVICES. AND ENHANCING THE PERFORMANCE OF IT SYSTEMS STATEWIDE. AND THIS IS A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN LIGHT OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACED- I IN RESPONSE TO COVER NINETEEN. THERE ARE CRITICAL SYSTEMS THAT YOU'VE- I'M SURE. YOU ALL HAVE MENTIONED EARLIER DIED- IT WAS SINCE NOT SCALED OR NOT READY TO DEAL WITH THE SCALE AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ISSUE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS ON. AIR FORCE THERE FOR INSTEAD OF IN A ACTION MODE AS DEPARTMENT OF TAKING. OFTEN IN TO BE SIGNED IN IN A- I RESCUE MO INTO THE DEPARTMENT'S WHO HAVE THEIR OWN TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM TO BE. A PART OF THE PORTFOLIO THAT WE ARE COMING IN AND HELP FIX ISSUES- ANYTIME WE'RE GOING AND ADDS A- REACTIVE WAY- OFF AND THE RESULT IS NOT IDEAL- SO WE WANTED TO GET OUT OF THAT. REACTIVE MODE AND BECOMING MORE OF A PROACTIVE IN IDENTIFYING PRIORITY SERVICES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND GET IN FRONT OF IT BEFORE THESE CRITICAL SERVICES ARE- YOU KNOW IT RAN INTO CHALLENGES- SECOND BCP RELATED TO THAT- I JUST. TALKED TO THE B. C. PIANO WERE OPEN UP FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE- IT I SHOULD MENTION IN THIS PARTICULAR B. C. P. WITH ALSO HAVE- ASKS FOR A SUPPORT RESOURCES- TO HELP IMPLEMENT THE RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED STATE- BROADBAND FOR ALL STRATEGIC PLAN. AND THAT IS THE WORK OF FOR MAY COLLABORATION FROM THE CALIFORNIA PROPPING COUNCIL WHERE I'M THE CHAIR OF AND I WORK WITH- MULTIPLE MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS THE MEMBER. REPRESENTING THE LEGISLATIVE- BRANCH- TO BE PART OF A PARKING COUNCIL- SO WE ARE VERY MUCH MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVE A BRAND NEW BROADBAND FOR ALL STRATEGY AND CAN BE ABLE. TO EXECUTE ACCORDINGLY- ALL OF THE IS IN WE CALL THE I- WORKLOAD COMPACTS. B. SECOND B. C. P. PERMITTING IS PERSON. IT'S A SECURITY BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL AND IN THIS PARTICULAR- I'D BETTER CHANGE PROPOSAL THERE'S ACTUALLY NO NET NEW ASK- IT'S A MATTER OF CHANGING THE FUNDING SOURCE FROM. A COST RECOVERY MODEL OF THE DEPARTMENT TO MORE OF A GENERAL FUND MODEL SO THAT THEY ARE FOR. INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM DEPARTMENTS WHICH IS ABOUT A HUNDRED THIRTY PLUS OF THEM INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA DO NOT HAVE TO- YEAH I'D PAY FOR SERVICES OF SPEAK- TO RECEIVE THESE TYPE OF A SECURITY MEASURE. AND THIS IS ANOTHER WAY THE ADMINISTRATION IS REALLY PRIORITIZING SECURITY AS A WAY OF DOING BUSINESS AS OPPOSED TO- I HAD A WAY OF A COST RECOVERY MEDFORD TO IMPROVE AND ENHANCE. THE SECURITY MEASURE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO THOSE ARE THE TWO BCPS ARE PRAYING FOR AND IF YOU'RE FOR CONSIDERATION- JUSTIN AND I ARE- HERE. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BERMAN FINE. BRIAN ONE OF THE FINALS WE HAVE NOTHING THAT ALL THIS WILL. WE NEED TO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BRIAN ONE OF THE FINANCE WE HAVE NOTHING TO ADD ON THIS PROPOSAL. RIGHT HOW ABOUT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. PRIME MINISTER L. A. O. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE STABILIZE CRITICAL SERVICES AND IT INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL BUT WITH BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE TO IMPROVE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THIS PROPOSAL CREATES NEW PROGRAMS FOR WHICH STATE ADMINISTRATIVE POLICY WOULD BE MADE AFTER THE PROPOSAL IS APPROVED AND THIS LACK OF POLICY IS PROBLEMATIC IN THAT IT MEANS THE LEGISLATURE LACKS KEY DETAILS ON HOW THE NEW PROGRAMS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED. INCLUDING WHO WILL BE SELECTED FOR CERTAIN ASSESSMENTS THE LENGTH AND SCOPE OF THOSE ASSESSMENTS HOW SHORT TERM REMEDIATION EFFORTS WILL LEAD TO LONG TERM PLANNING AND FUTURE I. T. PROJECTS AND WHAT REPORTING MECHANISMS WILL INFORM THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT THOSE ASSESSMENTS AND THEIR OUTCOMES. THEREFORE WE RECOMMEND SOME AMOUNT OF APPROVED FUNDING FOR THIS PROPOSAL BE CONDITIONED ON THE COMPLETION OF CHANGES IN ADMINISTRATIVE POLICY AND NOTIFICATION OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE EXACT AMOUNT OF THAT APPROVED FUNDING THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISION WOULD BE NEGOTIATED BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS CENTER A- THANK YOU MANAGER OF MR I'M JUST CURIOUS ON THIS BROADBAND INITIATIVE I COME FROM A COUNTY THAT'S FAIRLY LARGE AND WE HAVE ONE JUST NORTH OF US IT'S PROBABLY EVEN LARGER. AND THE BROADBAND DIFFICULTIES IN THE RIVER AND REMOTE RURAL REGIONS OF THE COUNTY ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE POINT THAT OF COURSE SUBSIDIES ARE NOT REALLY THE ISSUE. THERE'S JUST NO SERVICE WHATSOEVER OR AT ALL. AND DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT SORT OF- EXPENDITURE WOULD BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY BRENT BRING BROADBAND SERVICES TO. FOR EXAMPLE SCHOOL CHILDREN WHO ARE IN EASTERN RIVERSIDE COUNTY OR- IN THESE VERY RURAL AREAS ARE SCHOOL CHILDREN THAT ARE IN- SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY- MOST OF THE RURAL AREAS THERE. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION THE SENATOR ROTH AND I WOULD ALSO- SAID JUSTIN ANYTIME IF YOU'RE FREE TO JUMP IN AS WELL BECAUSE HE ALSO- PLAYED AN INSTRUMENTAL ROLE IN HELPING THE CALIFORNIA PROPPING COUNCIL IN PUTTING TOGETHER TO PLAN. BUT SPECIFICALLY TO YOUR QUESTION SENATOR OFFSIDE I THINK IT IT IS- NOT. ONLY A MATTER OF- COSTS TO BRING BROADBAND TO DOES YOUR ROLE COMMUNITY THE PRIMARY THINGS THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON FOR THE CALIFORNIA PROPERTY COUNCIL IS ACTUALLY HAVING MORE COMPETITIVE AND ADDITIONAL NUMBER OF PROVIDERS WHO CAN ACTUALLY BRAIN CONNECTIONS TO THESE WORLD COUNTY AND THEREFORE. DRIVES THAT COMPETITION AND COMPETITIVENESS ON WHAT'S THE BROADBAND THAT KNOWN NOT ONLY BEING BROUGHT FORWARD BUT IT'S AFFORDABLE BY TO RESIDENTS IN THOSE AREAS TO RECEIVE DISRUPTING SERVICES. SO ON THAT END- NAY CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IT'S ACTUALLY WORKING ON A SOLICITATION CALL THE STATE WHY RURAL CONNECTIVITY IT'S A MULTI TO WORK CONTRACT AND IT'S BEING- CHAMPIONED BY- CALIFORNIA PARKS AND RACKS. ALONG WITH THIRTEEN OTHER CO HOSTING DEPARTMENT TO JUST POINT A- YOU KNOW LEVERAGING THE STATE PURCHASING POWER- TO SAY THE LEAST BUT THE TO PUT THAT REQUEST OUT TO THE VENDOR COMMUNITY. AND THE WORLD CONNECTIVITY COSTS THE C. WHAT IS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO MEETING THAT REQUIREMENT. SO I'M JUST I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO ADD TO THAT- TO SENATORS QUESTION. THANK YOU SENATOR- THIS OBVIOUSLY A PRESS QUESTION FOR ALL. WORLD HEALTH. AND ALL CAL. THEY DON'T HAVE TO BROADBAND AND THIS ISSUES MORE PER IN THE CONTEXT OF THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC IN THE WORK FROM HOME ENVIRONMENT THAT. OPERATING AND- AS PART OF THE ACTION PLAN WORK- THERE'S A PIECE OF ANALYSIS THAT WAS COMMISSIONED BY THE CPUC- TO HELP IDENTIFY WHAT THE TOTAL COST OF. PUTTING OUT A BUILD TO ENSURE GIGABIT SERVICE ACROSS THE STATE AND ITS RELATIVELY CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE- BUT GIVES A BIT OF A SENSE OF THIS THE SORT OF THE TOTAL STICKER SHOCK- ENTAILED IN BEING ABLE TO SORT OF MEET THAT GOAL. OF A 100% COVERAGE OF OUR POPULATION ACROSS THE STATE AS BIG AS DIVERSE AS CALIFORNIA NO SIX POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS AND OF COURSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE TOTAL EXPENDITURE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PROVIDES IN TERMS OF BUILDING OUT OUR BROADBAND SERVICES. AS WELL AS EVEN THE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL MONEY THAT'S ALLOCATED TO READ. CLEARLY ONLY ALLOCATING A FRACTION OF THE TOTAL ESTIMATED COST AND SO. THAT'S REALLY JUST PUTTING A- YOU KNOW DOTTING THE I'S AND CROSSING THE. T. ON THE POINT THAT YOU'RE MAKING. BOB THERE ARE THEIR CPA. RULE AND- PROCEDURES. APPEAR TO BE A PET TO MOVING FORWARD ON THIS BROADBAND INITIATIVE THAT NEED TO BE VISITED OR REVISITED EITHER BY THIS LEGISLATURE OR- IN SOME OTHER FASHION. IF THE GOAL IS TO IMPROVE COMPETITOR A COMPETITIVE SITUATION DRIVE COMPETITION AND DRIVE MORE PROVIDERS DOES OUR PROCESS PERMIT THAT. IF THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION. RIGHT FROM FROM THE CURRENT I MEAN IT'S IF YOU SEE ACTUALLY HAS A SEAT ON THE CALIFORNIA ROBYN COUNCIL AS WELL AND WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WORK VERY COLLABORATIVELY AND THEN AND THEN THE KIND OF AN IMPROVING COUNCIL IT'S A PUBLIC- A MEETING PROCESS UNDER BAGLEY KEENE SO THERE'S A LOT OF A GOOD FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMUNITY AS WELL AS T. R. BOB FRANKEN BROADBAND PROVIDERS ON. WHAT IMPROVEMENTS CAN BE MADE TO HELP US STREAMLINE THE PROCESS SO THAT THERE'S MORE COMPETITIVENESS CAN BE INTRODUCED- SO AT THIS MOMENT- THIRST YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S SOME PROCESS BEING WORKED THROUGH IN THE CBCP UC'S PROCESS TO IMPROVE THAT BUT NOT NECESSARILY AT THE MOMENT WITHOUT WERE SAYING ANY LEGISLATION. ON A NEED TO ENHANCE DOT COM HOWEVER I WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY IS ALWAYS THERE SO THAT WHEN THEY'RE NEED TO RISE- YOU KNOW WE WOULD DEFINITELY WANT TO CONSIDER THAT. WELL THANK YOU I KNOW I JOIN WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN INLAND CALIFORNIA NORTH CENTRAL AND SOUTH AND BEING SERIOUSLY INTERESTED IN THIS ISSUE THERE ARE OTHERS OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE TAKING THE LEAD. ON THAT ISSUE IN BOTH THE ASSEMBLY IN THE SENATE AND I CERTAINLY DEFERRED OF THEM BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER CONVERSATIONS ON THIS SUBJECT CAN. FOLLOWING PROGRESS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH CENTER A CENTER NIELSEN. ON THE LATTER I WANT TO PAY IN A WELL THIS IS KIND OF BEEN A DECADE LONG ON MY PART REPRESENTING SO MANY. BUT CERTAIN DO CONCUR WITH THE- CHECK. THAT THE- SAID OF THE RIVER COUNTY FACE AND THEY'RE VERY SIMILAR. ALL THE WAVES UP TO OREGON BORDER. AND THIS IS AREA THAT DOESN'T SOME ATTENTION WE'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PROVIDERS- WITHIN IN ONE CASE IN WESTERN TAME A COUNTY WE HAD A SCHOOL SHOOTING- PROVOKING AND SHOT UP IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND THEN WESTERN COUNTY AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY ACCESS. TO ANYTHING. AND THAT WAS QUITE A PROBLEM TO SAY THE LEAST IN TERMS OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY. OF THOSE CHILDREN. SHOW THE EXPANSION OF BROADBAND ACCESS IS A VERY IMPORTANT AND I'M- VERY HAPPY TO SEE THAT THAT SOME ATTENTION IS BEING PAID- SHARE WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT WE WOULD END UP HAVING A LOT. OF ATTENTION. PAID A- IF I WERE DIRECTOR TONGA IF YOU ON TO A MOMENT. THE RECTOR SONG YOU AND I ARE VERY VERY GOOD FRIENDS AND I HAVE HIGHEST REGARD FOR YOU. BUT YOU MUST KNOW THAT I ONE OF BEEN THE MOST SERIOUS CRITICS OF THE AGENCY. AND ONE OF MY COMPRISES OF. THING YOU DO IS YOU JUST KEEP CHANGING THE NAME OF THE AGENCY BUT HERE'S THE POINT I WANT TO GET TO. L. ONE ASK THE ANALYST AS WELL AS YOU. WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT LET'S SAY YOU'RE NOT DO IT ANYMORE YOU'RE NOT ALONE YOU'RE OFFICE OF DIDN'T ALL I T. NOW SHOULD. THE DALLAS CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY OKAY. WELL THE LAST IS NOT A GOOD ONE. R. I. T. PROJECTS WITH MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE DATING TO THE NINETEEN NINETIES THE CALIFORNIA PROMOTIONAL SERVICES. THE PROGRAM THAT WAS- AT CDC ARE. NOT ON TIME BILLIONS OVER. AND CRUSHED AND BURNED THE PHONE AWAY. COMING CURRENT WE STILL HAVE BIG PROBLEMS. WHAT ARE YOU PUTTING IN PLACE TO ENSURE. THESE PROJECTS COME IN ON TIME. AND ON BUDGET AND THE PROVIDERS ARE NOT TAKING ADVANTAGEAND LIBERTIES WITH THE STATE WHICH I ARGUE I THINK THEY ARE. AND CORRECT OF TONGA WATER WE DO WANT TO MAKE THIS TECHNOLOGY CAPITAL OF THE WORLD. MORE THAN AN EMBARRASSMENT. WITH THE APPLICATION OF I. T. YES I APPRECIATE THE FRUSTRATION AND THE SENATE AND HOUSE AND- HEY DID YOU KNOW THAT I BY NO MEANS- WERE SAYING BAGHDAD YOU KNOW PERSONALLY YOU KNOW I KNOW WE CAN DO MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN THE TRACK RECORD THAT WE'RE ARE INHERITING. AND THE AND THE IN THE YOU KNOW THE PAST FEW YEARS- GOSH I CAN'T EVEN COUNT HOW MANY YEARS I'M IN THIS ROLE RIGHT NOW I HOPE THAT YOU HAVE SEEN THEIR HUSBAND INCREMENTAL CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENT THAT IT'S YOU KNOW BEING MADE JUST TO NAME A FEW IN FACT I WOULD ALSO CALL ATTENTION AS THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS NOW HAVE BEEN VERY TRANSPARENT WITH ALL OF THE- PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT. BOTH ON THE PROCUREMENT SIDE THE SUCCESS OR LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE PROJECT AS WELL AND IN THOSE PROJECTS ARE BOTH BIG AND SMALL ARE BEING ISSUED ON ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REPORT SO JUST HIGHLIGHTED A FEW OF THOSE IN THE ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REPORT OF TWENTY TWENTY SPECIFICALLY ITEMS RELATED TO COAL BUT NINETEEN- THERE HAS BEEN OVER TWENTY ONE PUBLIC REPORTS THAT WAS DEVELOPED IN RESPONSE TO PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY ON ANYTHING THAT ARE RELATED TO COVERT RESPONSE. THERE HAS BEEN MULTIPLE PROJECTS RELATED TO COVERT RESPONSE ANY FIRMWARE FROM CONTACT TRACING TO EXPOSURE NOTIFICATION TO THE ABILITY- TO. CLOSE SO THE- ASSISTANCE OF GETTING THE OUT. AS WELL AS- COMMITTEE TO. THROUGH THE COLD AND I WEBER TO PUT MOST RELEVANT OUT THERE OUR REST. I BELIEVE MAY OF THOSE YOU HAVE NOT NECESSARILY CAN ONLY THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE FAILURE TO WHAT BUT ANY TIME WHEN THE SYSTEM IS WORKING TO US KNOWING HE WAS IT'S A GOOD NEWS AND I WOULD SAY AS FAR WE HAVE GOT YOU KNOW GREAT FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMUNITY FROM THE RESIDENCE THAT MANY OF THOSE INFORMATION ABLE TO PROVIDE TO THEM IN A TIMELY MANNER. NOW COLEMAN NINETEEN ALSO GENERATED A NEW CHALLENGE THAT THINGS ARE MOVING ON THE WARP SPEED RIGHT IN THAT CASE WE DO KNOW THAT THERE'S MANY MANY CONTRACTS NEEDS TO BE CONDUCTED SERVICES OF PROVIDERS NEED TO BE BROUGHT IN AND EVEN WITH THAT- SENATOR NELSON WE HAVE NOT RELAXED THE REQUIREMENTS AND HOLDING THE VENDOR ACCOUNTABILITY EVEN THROW THOSE VERY RAPIDLY RAND PROCUREMENT- THE PROCUREMENT ITSELF ALL OF THE TECHNOLOGY PROCUREMENT DIED UNDER THE PURVIEW OF MY DEPARTMENT. WORKING WITH THE VARIOUS PROGRAM DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS PUBLIC HEALTH OR OTHERS ALL CONDUCTED UNDER THE COMPETITIVE MANNER SO THAT NOT ONLY SAVINGS WORK WAS BEING BROUGHT INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO THERE WERE STRONG- PERFORMANCE YOU KNOW- WITH HOLD IF THE DELIVERABLES ARE NOT RECEIVED THE VENDORS NOT GETTING PAID. AND I THINK THOSE ARE THE MEASURES THAT WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT WATER WE MOVING FAST WE ARE CONTINUE TO HOLD THE VENDORS YOU KNOW PERFORMED WITH THE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT IS SET. FOR BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I THE SENATE I. A WITH YOU THERE'S MENTION. THAT WE NEED TO DO AND WHICH IS THE WHY. ALSO IN THIS YEAR IN UNPRECEDENTED MANNER DIED. THE MINISTRATION WITH THE SUPPORT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION I WOULD SAY DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY HAVE ISSUE WITH A VISION TWENTY TWENTY THREE CLASS. AND IF YOU WOULD INDULGE ME I WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO HAVE JUSTIN TO GIVE A VERY BRIEF OVERVIEW OF ONE OF THE GOALS THAT WERE WE SET OUT TO SET. OUT TO ACHIEVE BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND THIS IS NOT ONLY TO JUST MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO. OF EIGHT OUR TECHNOLOGY TRACK RECORD WE HAVE TO IMPROVE IT AND WE HAVE TO CELEBRATE THE PACE OF IMPROVEMENT- THE BCP ALONG TODAY AS A WAY. OF CHANGING THE CONVERSATION FROM BEING REACTIVE TO PROACTIVE AND THE VISION TWENTY TWENTY THREE FURTHER YOU KNOW ENGAGES THE COMMUNITY AT THE END USER. END OF AND THE VENDOR OR FOR THAT MATTER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN NOT AND SHE NEEDED TO HAVE THE TRACK RECORD THAT WE HAVE TODAY IN THE TECHNOLOGY. SO WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GIVE A VERY BRIEF UPDATE ON THE VISION TWENTY TWENTY THREE. YEAH PLEASE IF YOU WERE DESERVES. MYSTERON. YEAH YES THANK YOU. BRENT THANK YOU DIRECTOR KONG THANK YOU SENATOR. SO WE PUT TOGETHER THIS BILL ISN'T TWENTY IN THE- OF NINE. AND SO WORK. REMINDED US THE FRIDGE. OF COMMUNITIES BUSINESSES AND LIVES THAT ARE DEPENDENT ON GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS AND SHOWN THAT IT MUST THAT WE MUST PREPARE BETTER- AND BE MORE RESILIENT TO MEET THE MOMENTS WHEN THEY WHEN THEY TELL THAT'S WHAT WE DID IS WE WENT OUT AND I'M- PARTICIPATION IN THE CONTEXT OF GLOBAL PANDEMICS ERECTED MORE THAN SIXTY INTERVIEWS ACROSS AGENCY AND DEPARTMENTAL LEADERS. NOT JUST IN TECHNOLOGY BUT ALSO ON THE PROGRAM SIDE. WE ENGAGE WITH MANY MEMBERS OF YOUR STAFF AND STAFF- WITHIN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE JUDICIAL BRANCH WITH THE WITH BRIAN AND THE L. A. O. TEAM. AS WELL AS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WE ENGAGED OVER FOUR HUNDRED PROVIDERS INCLUDING 30% WHO'D NEVER DONE BUSINESS WITH THE STATE BEFORE. SURVEYED STAFF ACROSS THE STATE REALLY IT SHOULD JUST CONTEXTUALIZE THE PICTURE OF HOW TECHNOLOGY WAS BEING USED IN COULD BE USED ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE LEARNED OUT OF THAT EXPERIENCE WAS THAT WE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS AND CRITICALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF COVE IT CAN MAKE IT REALLY QUICKLY BUT THAT WASN'T ENOUGH WE NEED TO BOTH SOLVE PROBLEMS TOGETHER AND SO THAT MEANS BRINGING THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE POLICY TOGETHER TO HELP DESIGN AND DO THIS WORK IT MEANS ENGAGING OUR USERS ENGAGING OUR STAKEHOLDERS FOR CRITICAL PARTICIPANTS IN THE ACTUAL USE OF THE TECHNOLOGY. WE NEED TO EASIER AND FASTER WAYS TO GET STARTED- WE CAN'T ADMIRE THE PROBLEMS FOR TOO LONG- AND ACTUALLY PUSH OUT THE EXPERIENCE OF THE USER. SEEING NEW FUNCTIONALITY. AND THERE IS A NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NO ONE HAD THE RIGHT ANSWER WASN'T THAT THE YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY SENATOR NELSON THESE ARE THESE ARE CHALLENGING PROBLEMS- AND THEY REQUIRE A LOT OF. A LOT OF ELBOW GREASE TO BE ABLE TO RESOLVE THEM. AND SO WE PUT OUT THREE GUIDING PRINCIPLES TO HELP DIRECT THE WAY THAT WE ENGAGE IN THIS WORK AS A STATE AND PUT OUT FIVE GOALS. THE THREE THE THREE PRINCIPLES ARE FIRST PUT PEOPLE FIRST SO AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ARE BUILDING TECHNOLOGY FOR TO DELIVER SERVICES TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA- AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION AND LEARNING AND UNDERSTANDING AND BUILDING FOR THOSE PEOPLE. AS WELL AS THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY DELIVER THE SERVICES SO. YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE GOT A PUBLIC SERVANT WHO'S LOOKING AT A GREEN SCREEN AND TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING BY- BY A CALIFORNIA. THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH WE ACTUALLY NEED TO MAKE THE EXPERIENCE BETTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVANT AS WELL. TO WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE MAKING CONTINUOUS AND TIMELY IMPROVEMENTS- CONTINUOUS IN THE SENSE THAT WE NEED TO INCREASE THE VELOCITY OF CHANGE IN OUR SYSTEMS. BUT ALSO WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT SYSTEMS WORK AS DESIGNED WHEN THEY'RE NEEDED. IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THAT TO HAPPEN YOU KNOW TWO MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD IF YOU ACTUALLY NEED SOMETHING THAT'S URGENT FROM YOUR. GOVERNMENT YOU NEED AT THAT POINT IN TIME. THE THIRD IS WORKING TO. IT'S WORKING ALONE AND THAT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE COLLABORATION THAT'S REQUIRED ACROSS. TECHNOLOGY POLICY AND OPERATIONS OF THE STATE BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR USERS- AND SO IN THE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR OBVIOUSLY YOU SEE A LOT MORE INTEGRATED TEAMS WHEN IT COMES TO PRODUCT TEAMS AND- INTEGRATION ACROSS DISCIPLINES AS WELL BETWEEN ENGINEERING AND PRODUCT AND USER RESEARCH. AND THAT IS AS IMPORTANT TO DO YOU IN IN GOVERNMENT AS IT IS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. WE PUT UP FIVE GOALS- AND I'LL SKIP THROUGH THIS QUICKLY- AND HAPPY TO GO INTO MORE DETAIL AS NEEDED- DELIVER EASY TO USE FAST DEPENDABLE AND SECURE PUBLIC SERVICES AND SO YOU KNOW IF YOU TALK TO ME- AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ADMINISTRATION. WE WOULD HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON EASY TO USE AND FAST- GIVEN THE COURSE OF THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS WE'VE HAD A LOT OF FOCUS ON DEPENDABLE AND SECURE- AND THAT YOU KNOW TO DIRECTOR TALKS POINT EARLIER THIS IS PART OF WHAT HELPS FRAME. THE P. C. P. PROPOSAL AROUND STABILIZING CRITICAL SERVICES BECAUSE THE LAST THING THAT WE WANT TO DO IS RESPOND AFTER SOMETHING FAILS WE WANT TO GET AHEAD OF IT AND STABILIZE IT IN ADVANCE. TO IS ENSURING THAT OUR PUBLIC% SERVICES ARE EQUITABLE AND INCLUSIVE AND SO- REFER FROM SEVERAL SENATORS ARE BROWN DEPARTMENTS OF THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF BROADBAND. BUT IT'S BIGGER THAN JUST BROADBAND IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE CONTENT IN THE DESIGN AND THE OPERATION OF OUR SERVICES SO TO USE A SIMPLIFIED EXAMPLE- THE READABILITY OF OUR WEBSITE SOME OF THE CONTENT THAT WE PUT OUT INTO THE WORLD OFTEN EXCESSIVE POSTGRADUATE READING LEVEL- WORDS IF WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. OUR SERVICES ARE ACCESSIBLE AND INCLUSIVE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE SHOULD BE TARGETING A SEVENTH OR NINTH GRADE READING LEVEL. IT TURNS OUT IT'S REALLY HARD TO WRITE AT THAT LEVEL THAT REQUIRES SIMPLIFICATION COURSE WORK AND THAT'S AS TRUE ON THE PROCESS. SIDE AS WELL. THE THIRD IS MAKING COMMENT. EASY TO. USE AND RE USE ACROSS STATE- AND SO A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS IS A- IDENTIFICATION SO IN THE CONTEXT OF A PANDEMIC WHERE THE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS TO BE IN PERSON. ACTUALLY IDENTIFYING MYSELF AS A THE PERSON THAT I SAY I AM. IS AN IMPORTANT UNLOCKED FOR THE WAY THAT WE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND RIGHT NOW THAT PROBLEM IS GETTING SOLVE MULTIPLE TIMES ACROSS THE STATE. AND WE WANT TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE FEDERATING THAT UP AND- CREATING THE RIGHT INTEROPERABLE LADY ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INSTEAD OF SOLVING MATTER PROGRAM. OR DEPARTMENTAL LEVEL. THE FOURTH IS BUILDING DIGITAL GOVERNMENT MORE QUICKLY AND MORE EFFECTIVELY. AND SO- CENTER PARK PART OF THE QUESTION- AROUND YOU KNOW HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT PROJECTS MORE SUCCESSFUL GOING FORWARD. IS THAT ONE OF THE- ONE OF THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT GOES BEHIND A LOT OF BIG TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS IS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT MISTER RIP AND REPLACE EXISTING LEGACY SYSTEMS. WELL ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP MORE CASE HISTORY AROUND IS HOW DO WE MODERNIZE LEGACY INFRASTRUCTURE ANYMORE GET RID OF MATTER- YOU KNOW USING THINGS LIKE THE STRANGLER PATTERN TO BE ABLE TO TAKE FF BITS OF FUNCTIONALITY FROM LEGACY SYSTEMS AND MAKE IT BETTER OVER TIME. AND ACTUALLY CHALLENGES THE BASED ASSUMPTION THAT YOU NEED A BILLION DOLLAR PROJECT TO RIP AND REPLACE SOMETHING ALL AT ONCE. THE LAST- THE LAST GOAL THAT WE PUT OUT IS BUILDING CONFIDENT EMPOWERED MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS. IT'S A PART OF THIS IS ABOUT CREATING THE RIGHT SPACES ON THE RIGHT CASE HISTORY. FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO BRING OUT THE BEST ACROSS. THE VARIOUS PEOPLE THAT ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS SUCCESSFUL. TO PUT ALL THIS OUT ON- VISION TWENTY TWENTY THREE DOT C. T. DOT CA DOT GOV. IT'S PUBLISHED IN THE OPEN WE'VE ASKED FOR FEEDBACK- AND IDEAS FROM THE BROADER COMMUNITY AND FROM THE STATE. WE PUT OUT SPECIFIC CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO- GET TEAMS AROUND TO BE ABLE TO BEGIN MAKING PROGRESS AGAINST THESE GOALS OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT THREE YEARS. HAPPY TO TAKE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND APOLOGIES IF THAT WENT A LITTLE BIT LONGER. THAN ANY I PROMISED WELL I THANK YOU AND I THANK% YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. AND IT'S COSTING US BILLIONS OF DOLLARS I'M PARTICULARLY AT THE SWEET NEWS OF DIRECTOR TONG THAT THE COMPANIES TO DO NOT MEET THEIR CONTRACTUAL MILESTONES ARE NOT GETTING PAID. I HOPE THAT THAT WAS OF AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM THAT WAS INTENDED. TO GET THEIR ATTENTION MAYBE IT HAS. IF I MADE AND ONE MORE. IF WE COULD IT TO THE LEGEND. IF CONCUR THAT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE. THE JOURNALIST. THANK YOU SENATOR- WE AGREED WITH- OF LARGE NUMBER OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE VISION TWENTY TWENTY THREE STRATEGIC PLAN- WE AGREE PARTICULARLY WITH THE IDEA OF C. T. TAKING A MORE PROACTIVE ROLE IN STATE GOVERNMENT LOOKING AT LEGACY SYSTEMS ACROSS THE STATE GOVERNMENT ENTITIES HELPING TO IDENTIFY WHICH ONES ARE MOST IN NEED OF REPLACEMENT OR- YOU KNOW ITERATIVE UPGRADES- WE AGREE WITH THE OBSERVATION THAT WE NEED TO HAVE- PROCESSES IN PLACE THAT ALLOW- MORE YOU KNOW REASONABLE SMALLER SIZE PROJECTS TO BE DONE IN A QUICKER BASIS THOSE SORTS OF OBSERVATIONS WE LARGELY AGREE WITH- WE SIMPLY REYES YOU KNOW ISSUES WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION- THE- ABILITY. OF NEED TO UNDERGO THIS WORK WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANS WHEN IT'S PUT INTO ADMINISTRATIVE POLICY- WE'VE HAD ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT THE NEED FOR NEW REPORTING MECHANISMS FOR PROJECTS THAT USE FOR EXAMPLE AN AGILE APPROACH. TO DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION WHICH- ARE SUPPOSED TO ALLOW FOR MORE YOU KNOW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND BUSINESS NEEDS TO BE MET QUICKLY- BUT CAN ALSO CHALLENGE THE LEGISLATURE IN ITS OVERSIGHT OF THESE- PARTICULAR PROJECTS AND SO. WE'VE HAD ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT WE APPRECIATE THEIR STRATEGIC PLAN- WE CONTINUE TO MEET WITH THEM ON A REGULAR BASIS TO DISCUSS HOW BEST TO MOVE FORWARD ON THESE ADMINISTRATIVE POLICY ITEMS- BUT WE ALSO WOULD JUST MENTION THAT YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY HERE- FOR PARTICULAR PROJECTS THAT ARE COMPLEX AND COSTLY. WE HAVE RECOMMENDED IN THE YOU KNOW RECENT PAST. THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO TO IMPROVE ITS OVERSIGHT OF LARGER PROJECTS INCLUDING LOOKING AT THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT BEFORE IT IS FORMALLY APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE SURE THAT IT AGREES WITH THAT SCOPE- IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME OF THESE LARGER PROJECTS THAT CAN APPROACH. YOU KNOW AS YOU SAID SENATOR BILLION DOLLARS CAN BE SCHOOL DIFFERENTLY SUCH THAT THEY DON'T HAVE SUCH A HIGH YOU KNOW COST- BETTER OPPORTUNITIES TO- CONDITION THE APPROVAL OF CERTAIN AMOUNTS OF FUNDING ON THE RECEIPT OF YOU KNOW ALL OF THE PLANNING DOCUMENTS THAT ARE REQUIRED UNDER THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE. NOT SOMETHING WE RECOMMEND AS A BEST PRACTICE FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND THEN IF A PROJECT IS APPROVED HAVING THE LEGISLATURE MAKE ITS INTENT CLEAR IN STATUTE OR SETTING PROJECT GOALS SUCH THAT THERE IS AND A SET OF METRICS OR- YOU KNOW PERFORMANCE STANDARDS THAT ARE. APPLIED TO THESE PROJECTS COME BEFORE THEY'RE COMPLETED AND THAT WILL GIVE THE LEGISLATURE MORE CONFIDENCE IN THE FINAL PRODUCT THAT IS- YOU KNOW PROVIDED BY DEPARTMENT SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE OBSERVATIONS THAT I HAVE TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY BUT HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH. YOU FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL CON TRACKS A LATIN AND- BY. THE GM OR- THE- SAID FOR. I T. WHO DOES THE ACT NEGOTIATION OF THE CONTRACT H. SO IN THE LARGE SCALE PROCUREMENT IF IT'S TECHNOLOGY PROJECT RELATED DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IT'S AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE AND IN GOLD IN THE NEGOTIATION ALONG WITH THE PROGRAM DEPARTMENT- IN THE SMALLER SCALE PROJECTS THE DEPARTMENT HAS THE DELEGATED AUTHORITY THAT THEY DO THEY ARE AT THE TABLE TO NEGOTIATING NOT THEMSELVES AND I THINK THIS WAY COMES TO THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE OVERSIGHT ROLE OF DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND WE DO AGREE WITH MANY OF THE OBSERVATION THE L. A. O. HAS IN HOW TO. MAKE SURE THAT WHILE WE ARE ADVOCATING FOR SMALL THE CONTRACTS AND SMALL THE PROJECTS TO BE DONE AT THE PUMP TECHNOLOGY CONTINUE TO HAVE A STRONG OVERSIGHT ROLE IN MAKING SURE THAT THOSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND IS IN THE FAVOR OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WELL YOU MADE ME MORE COMFORTABLE AND THAT'S TWICE IN ONE WEEK- DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY I TALKED WITH THE HAVE THE HEAD OF THE FENCE CAL. AND THAT WAS ANOTHER ONE THAT IS HEADED TOWARDS DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES IT MAY BE THAT THAT'S ON BETTER GROUNDS DO SO IT IS HELPFUL BUT WE MUST TO PAY HEED AND KEEP TRACK OF IT AND I SURELY WILL AS THINGS GO ON DAY AFTER DAY BECAUSE THESE ARE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT AND COULD EMBARRASSING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT WE CAN'T GET TECH RIGHT.THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU VERY SENATOR I THAT'S A FOLLOW UP TO THOSE- ONCE CONTRACT IS- IS. EFFECTUATED AND THE PROJECT STARTS WHO'S THE ONE THAT THAT DOES THE MANAGEMENT OF THE CONTRACT. RIGHT MADAM CHAIR SO THE MANAGEMENT OF THE CONTRACT IT'S AT THE PROGRAM- DEPARTMENT LEVEL HOWEVER THE OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY IS SOMETHING THAT WE CALL THE PROJECT OVERSIGHT CONTINUE TO REMAINS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. AND THAT'S WHERE WE AGREE THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN THE OVERSIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A TWO TIER SYSTEM FOR RISK AND ISSUE TO BE ADDRESSED QUICKLY. VERY GOOD WELL I APPRECIATE THAT THAT INFORMATION AND IT'S PARTICULARLY CRITICAL BECAUSE I THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGES YOU HAVE. THE CONTRACT NEGOTIATED BY ONE SET OF INDIVIDUALS AND THEN YOU HAVE THE CONTRACT MANAGEMENT IN THE HANDS OF DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS AND THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE- THE OUT THE OUTCOMES ARE THE DELIVERABLES THAT THE CONTRACT. INVASIONS AND SO WHEN THOSE DELIVERABLS. ARE NOT MET BUT THEY'RE NOT IDENTIFIED AS A PROBLEM IN THE CONTRACT YOU START LOSING THE OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD THE- THE CONTRACTOR TO THAT CONTRACT AND IT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT LEGALLY AFTER THE FACT TO BE ABLE TO GET SATISFACTION YOU'RE YOU'RE NEGOTIATING A CONTRACT ALL OVER AGAIN. SENATE ROTH THANK YOU MAN I'M SURE YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN OUT OF THIS THE END OF OUR BUSINESS FOR A COUPLE YEARS BUT- MISS TALKING ABOUT HOW SUCCESSFUL ARE YOU IN TERMS OF PROPERLY SCOPING THESE. IT PROJECTS SO WE TRY TO START WITH THE SMALLEST. COMMON DENOMINATOR AND THEN BUILD ON THAT TRYING TO IF TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOSS TO MINIMIZE LOSSES WE MOVE FORWARD. I SEEM TO REMEMBER THOSE DISCUSSIONS OF YEARS AGO FOLLOWING SOME RATHER LARGE IT FAILURES. AND THE VARIOUS COMMENTATORS ON IT PROJECTS AT THE TIME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO SCALE DOWN THE SCOPE OF THE IT PROJECTS AND YOU KNOW BY THE END SHOULD SISENSE BY THE YARD IT'S HARD SO. I GUESS THE SIMPLE QUESTION IS HOW SUCCESSFUL WE'VE BEEN IMPROPERLY SCOPING IT PROJECTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET DONE WHAT WE CAN GET DONE AND THEN BUILD ON THAT. TRYING TO AVOID FAILURE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. I SENATOR ROBERT DEFINITELY REMEMBER THAT FROM THE FROM THE DAY THAT I STEP IN THIS ROLE AND YOU HAVE BEEN A- VERY CONSTRUCTIVE UNEMPLOYED AND IN TERM OF GOSH THERE'S GOING TO BE. A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS AND YES IT WAS ABOUT THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO- THAT THE CONVERSATION HAVE STARTED ON HOW THE STATE ARE SHIFTING FROM THESE GIGANTIC MONOLITHIC PROJECTS WHICH WE SEE THEM. BACK DOWN AS THE NORM TO NOW FOUR YEARS LATER THAT MAJORITY OF THESE PROJECTS ARE NO LONGER THESE MODERNIZE THE ELECTRIC MULTI YEARS- I'M LITERALLY JUST PULLING UP THE- A PERFORMANCE METRICS. ARE PRESENTED IN THE- PERFORMANCE REPORT TO TWENTY. AND IF YOU CAN INDULGE ME FOR A MINUTE HERE I CAN PUT THE ACTUAL NUMBER SAY HOW MANY PROJECTS ARE HAVE BEEN REDUCED- BUT THERE YOU GO. SO THREE YEARS AGO- I WOULD SAY 8290% OF THE PROJECT THERE ARE COMING IN IN THE HUNDREDS OF. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND THEY'RE AVERAGING YEARS OR FIVE YEARS OR MORE TO RUN AND OBVIOUSLY THAT NUMBER OF. YEARS AND THE DOLLAR AMOUNT EQUATES TO HIGHER RISK. TODAY WE HAVE MAJORITY OF THOSE RE OF PROJECTS ARE DOWN TO. IN THAT SIDE IS AN EX. ALL TO RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHILE- OTHER LARGE PROJECT TWENTY ONE OF THEM ARE IN WHAT WE CALL THE SMALLER SCALE- AND THEN THE SMALLER SCALE DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THEY'RE PIECEMEAL I THINK THAT'S THE IMPORTANT POINT THAT WERE ALSO TRYING TO MAKE. IT STOP YOU MIGHT HAVE A MASTER PLAN TO ACHIEVE A GOAL HOWEVER THAT EACH OF THOSE. MODULES CAN BE MANAGED AND DEMONSTRATE THE SSS BEFORE ADDITIONAL MODULES CAN BE APPROVED SO THAT SO THAT I THINK THE STATE OF ALSO GONE THROUGH ITS LEARNING PROCESS. FROM YOU KNOW COMPLETING MOVING COMPLETELY MOVING AWAY FROM THE LARGE PROJECTS TO THE AGILE PROCESS AND FOUR MINUTE MAKING SURE THE I. JOE IS STILL FOLLOWING A MASTER PLAN SO THAT THE TOTALITY OF THE INVESTMENT BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. STILL HAVE THE APPROVAL AND OVERSIGHT FROM THE LEGISLATURE UNTIL BAD IS STEEP PROCESS THAT WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE ON THE PICKETING THAT TOOK PLACE ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO FOR EVERYTHING THAT IS IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS DOLLARS. TO SMALLER MODULE A SMALL THE MODULE WITH THE MASTER PLAN. THANK YOU FOR THAT THE RESPONSE AND THANK YOU FOR THAT FOR YOUR. WORK IN THAT REGARD THANK YOU MA'AM SURE. YEAH SENATOR JUST COMPOSING POINT THAT THAT BRINGS IT FORWARD TO. ALMOST TODAY. SEVERAL AGO IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A NEW WEBSITE AVAILABLE. TO THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA TO ACCESS THE CROW CORONAVIRUS AND WHEN THEY COULD GET THE SHOTS AT CENTER AND THAT WAS GOING TO BE THE BIG PANACEA WELL THAT WAS OF SOMETHING THAT BROUGHT FORTH A LOT A WHOLE CERTAINLY I WAS EXCITED TO HEAR ABOUT IT. UNTIL I FOUND OUT THAT FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE IT'S ONLY GONNA BE ACCESSIBLE TO TWO LARGE COUNTIES AND ALL THE REST OF THE COUNTY SINCE SIXTY OR FIFTY FOUR FIFTY SIX COUNTIES WILL GET RATHER THAN LATER SOMETIMES SIX WEEKS OR MORE AHEAD. NOW I KNOW THAT'S AS COMPLICATED AS SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WITHIN THESE VARIOUS AGENCIES YOU'RE CONTRACTING WITH. BUT THAT WAS KIND OF ANOTHER ONE LIKE HERE WE GO AGAIN. THIS IS A PROMISE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER IT BECAUSE MODOC COUNTY MIGHT NOT GET THIS FOR YEARS. UP TO SO WE BETTER BE CAREFUL ABOUT OVER PROMISING TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR I APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY I THINK IT'S BEEN VERY HELPFUL- OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT. IMPORTANT WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING- THIS IS A HOLDOVER OPEN ITEM SO I'M SURE WE'LL BE BACK AND WE'LL SEE THIS AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO. THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY NINE WHICH IS THE REGULATIONS UNIT FUNDING EXTENSION. HI MY NAME IS ABOUT RYAN MARK CROFT- I AM BE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS- AT- LEGAL AFFAIRS DIVISION- THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING A TWO YEAR FUNDING EXTENSION. TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING EIGHT EXISTING POSITIONS AND PEOPLE IN THE DEPARTMENTS REGULATIONS UNIT. THE UNIT WAS ESTABLISHED TO ADDRESS AN INCREASING REGULATIONS WORKLOAD. IMPROVING THE TIMELINESS OF REGULATIONS IMPROVING THEIR QUALITY AND RESPONDING TO NEW LEGISLATION. AND SINCE IT WAS ESTABLISHED THE UNIT HAS MADE GOOD PROGRESS IN IMPROVING QUALITY IMPROVING TIMELINESS AND PROVIDING ADDITIONAL TRAINING. MORE THAN TRIPLE THE. THAN IN THE PRIOR YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN MORE REGULATIONS WERE APPROVED IN BECAME LAW LAST YEAR THAN IN PRIOR YEARS AND ZERO WERE REJECTED. GIVEN THIS POSITIVE PROGRESS THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING TWO YEAR FUNDING EXTENSION TO ALLOW IT TO CONTINUE IMPLEMENTING AND EVALUATING THE NEW UNIT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF OUR REQUEST I'M HAPPY TO FIELD ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. BERMAN FINANCE ANY COMMENTS H. R. DEPARTMENT FINANCE WE WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT AS THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO STAND REGULATION PACKAGES TO FINANCE FOR REVIEW WE HAVE NOTICED THAT- THE QUALITY OF THE ECONOMIC AND FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENTS ARE MUCH BETTER AND A MORE THOROUGH- IN THE NEWER PACKAGES THAN BEFORE AND WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO FULLY IMPLEMENT AND EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS EFFECTIVENESS OF A DEDICATED REGULATIONS JANET. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LMAO. TO SORT OF WORK WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE DID NOT RAISE CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL. VERY GOOD. COMMENT TO QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SENATOR NIELSEN. WELL I MUST SAY I WAS NOT COVERED BY YOUR OBSERVATION THAT YOU'RE PROCESSING MORE REGULATIONS. I THINK THE PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LOT FEWER. REGULATIONS THAT ISN'T THE POINT THOUGH THAT I WANT TO MAKE HERE IN TERMS OF YOUR REGULATION UNIT AND THE DCA PARTICULARLY USES REGULATIONS FOR MANY MANY THANKS MANY MANY. AGENCIES AND THESE REGULATIONS ARE OF THE MOST COMPLAINED ABOUT THINGS THAT WE LEGISLATORS DEAL WITH. THE REGULATIONS THAT BUSINESSES AND PROFESSIONS HAVE GOT TO DEAL WITH ALL OVER CALIFORNIA. I'M GLAD YOU'RE STAYING AS A LIMITED TERM. WITH THIS UNIT AND WE'LL SEE IF IT DOES ITS JOB OR NOT. BUT I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT TO WONDER SHE HAD FULLY IMPLEMENTED AT THIS POINT AT ALL. AT THE END WITHIN THE A FUNDING EXTENSION YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PROVE A LOT TO ME ABOUT THE MERIT OF IT. AND I WOULD SUGGEST AND THIS REALLY IS NOT ON YOU WOULD BE ON THE- THE AT THE- OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE. JUSTICE SEVEN EDGE. WHAT IS IT OFFICE OF THE MINISTER. LAW MINISTER TO BLOCK. THE DINNER AT MINISTRY OF ALL I SHOULD KNOW BECAUSE I HELPED CREATE THE DARN THING LONG TIME AGO. BUT BUT MY HOPES WERE DASHED IN THAT LAW WHICH WAS PASSED WITH THE FRESHMAN SENATOR WORKING WITH A VERY POWERFUL SPEAKER THEN LIAM MCCARTHY. THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT DID REQUIRE THAT DEPARTMENT TO REVIEW THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE REGULATION IT IS MY OPINION OVER THE DECADES THAT THE LEAST IS GOTTEN SHORT SHRIFT IF NOT TOTALLY IGNORED. AND I WOULD JUST SUBMIT TO THE DEPARTMENT DCA TO KEEP THAT IN MIND THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF YOUR REGULATIONS THANK YOU MESSAGES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I WONDER IF THE DEPARTMENT COULD- ARTICULATE WHAT WHAT HAPPENS. PRACTICALLY SPEAKING WHEN IT WELL FIRST OF ALL IS THAT I THINK THE REASON THAT THIS B. C. P. CAME FORWARD IN THE FIRST PLACE IS BECAUSE OF LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRE REQUIRED- CHANGES IN THE REGULATION SO I APPRECIATE THE- WHY IT'S BEING IMPLEMENTED IT'S TEMPORARY. BUT I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD THAT GIVE US A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF WHERE. THE REGULATION GOES HOW IT STARTS ON AND WHERE IT GOES TO AN INCH AS PART OF THE- THE DESCRIPTION OF WHY TAKES A LONG. MY PLEASURE THANK YOU FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY AND JUST TO CLARIFY- BRIEFLY THE REGULATIONS UNIT- IT IS. ONE OF THE ARE IMPORTANT GOALS THAT THE UNIT- TRIES TO ACHIEVE IS TO IMPLEMENT NEW STATUTES NEW LEGISLATION ENACTED BY THIS BODY. AND SO THAT IS DEFINITELY A NEW NEW LAW IS BEING IMPLEMENTED- AND IT ENACTED- ONE OF OUR PRIMARY GOALS IS TO. ENSURE THAT THE ALLIES CARRIED OUT AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE GAPS THAT NEED TO BE FILLED IN ON A REGULATORY LEVEL THAT WE'RE DOING THAT SO THAT IS ONE OF THE GOALS AND ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF THE UNIT. BUT THE UNIT WAS REALLY A BROADER EFFORT FOR THE DEPARTMENT- A BROADER EFFORT BECAUSE OVERALL REGULATIONS WORKLOAD HAD INCREASED- YEAR OVER YEAR AND IT WILL BE DEMAND FOR REGULATIONS HAVE INCREASED YEAR OVER YEAR. AND YOU ALL ARE AWARE THIS DEPARTMENT IS COMPRISED OF APPROXIMATELY THIRTY SEVEN SEPARATE REGULATORY BODIES AND EACH OF THEM HAVE. A REGULATIONS THAT THEY WERE ARE GENERATING FOR ALL OF THE DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO- THE BECAUSE OF JUST INCREASING AND STATUTORY LAW THAT DRIVES A LITTLE BIT OF AN INCREASE IN REGULATORY LAW AS WELL- IT IN ADDITION TO THAT- THE DEPARTMENT- WHICH WAS GETTING A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF REGULATIONS REJECTED BY THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW FOR NOT MEETING STANDARDS- AND BECAUSE OF THAT. WE REALLY I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO WITH WHEN THAT BCP WAS FIRST APPROVED. WE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO REGROUP AND- AND IMPROVE THE PROCESS AND THAT WAS HOW THIS REGULATIONS UNIT WAS BORN WHAT OUT OF TRYING TO BOTH IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE REGULATIONS THAT THE DEPARTMENT WAS PUTTING FORWARD SO THEY WOULD STOP GETTING REJECTED BY THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. MEETING THAT DEMAND THAT WAS INCREASING OVER. THE YEARS- AND ALSO INTO RETICULAR NEXT. A SPECIAL ONES TERM THAT DRIVEN INTO NINETEEN. THAT'S ONE OF THAT BEEN ON THE FOREFRONT OF OUR OUR MIND OF THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF BUT IT'S ONLY- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WERE REALLY- SETTING SETTING OURSELVES TO TRY AND TACKLE LONG TERM. WE'RE HOPING THAT THIS IS- A LONG TERM EFFORT BUT UNDERSTANDING THEM THIS IS- WE'RE STILL WE'RE STILL IMPLEMENTING A NEW PROCESS AND SO WANTING TO TEST THAT OUT. A TEAR TO YOUR SECOND QUESTION ABOUT JUST PROCESS WHAT IS THE PROCESS. TO EAT LIKE I MENTIONED EACH OF THE PORTS- THEY ARE VESTED WITH STATE LAW MAKING ABILITY OF MAKING REGULATIONS. J. DRAFT I TAXED VERY MUCH LIKE STATUTORY TEXT AT REGULATORY LEVEL. AND THEY APPROVE THAT TEXT USUALLY A PUBLIC BOARD MEETINGS WHERE THERE'S COMMENTS ON IT- AND THEN THEY DO THAT WITH THE INPUT OF THE ATTORNEYS THAT ARE IN THE REGULATIONS UNIT WITH SOME OF THEIR OWN STAFF AND EXPERTS ON STAFF THAT BUT NO THE POLICY ISSUES VERY WELL. AND THEN WITH OUR BUDGET STAFF IN THE REGULATIONS UNIT HAS ACTUALLY A DEDICATED- FISCAL A STAFF MEMBER WHOSE JOB IT IS. TO HELP EVALUATE ALL OF THE DIFFERENT- FISCAL AND ECONOMIC AFFECTS IMPACTS OF THE REGULATIONS THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS PUTTING OUT. TO THAT TEXT IS DRAFTED IT IS SUBMITTED TO THE STATE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW FOR A FORTY FIVE DAY PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD FOR THE PUBLIC HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE INTO THAT THAT BORDER OR THAT BUREAU. AND COMMENT ON THE REGULATIONS ASK FOR CHANGES- AND HIS VOICE THEIR VOICE THEIR. SUPPORT THEIR OPPOSITION THAT KIND OF THING. I THE END OF THAT FIVE DAY PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD- THE- DOC. ARE THAT DOCUMENT SIMILAR THE DOCUMENTS THAT SUPPORT STATUTES. LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL DIGEST COMMITTEE- COMMITTEE ANALYSES A LOT OF THAT SAME. CONCEPT EXISTS IN THE REGULATORY WORLD AS WELL- AND SO THOSE DOCUMENTS ARE ARE IN LARGE PART DRAFTED BY THE ATTORNEYS IN THE REGULATIONS UNIT- THE- STATE ASSIST- THE STAFF OF THE PORTS THE EXTENT THE COURTS HAVE THE STAFF TO HELP DO THAT- THE DATE THEY- COMPILE ALL THOSE DOCUMENTS. THEY GIVE THEM OVER TO ONLY OFFER PUBLIC NOTICE THEY MAKE CHANGES BASED ON THE PUBLIC INPUT THEY RECEIVE. AND THEN- DOES THE THOSE FILES ARE. GIVEN TO YOU. DO YOU SEE A MORE GENERALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE FISCAL LEGAL ISSUES HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED. THEY ARE LOOKED AT BY THE AGENCY THAT IS ABOVE THIS DEPARTMENT- WHICH IS A FAIRLY COMMON THING IN THE STATE WHERE- THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THE FISCAL ANALYSES AS WELL AND THE REGULATIONS AND JUST AND ENSURING FROM. A LARGER PERSPECTIVE THAT THERE'S OVERSIGHT OVER WHAT THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS UNDER THE AGENTS YOU'RE DOING- THEY ARE- LOOKED AT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FROM A FISCAL AND ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE. AND THEN THERE SUBMITTED TO THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. AND ONCE THERE THE OFFICE OFADMINISTRATIVE LAW TYPICALLY HAS ABOUT THIRTY DAYS TO REVIEW IT. AND HOPEFULLY APPROVING IT AND FORTUNATELY FOR US ONE OF THE CHANGES THAT WE MADE. TO IMPROVE QUALITY HAS HAS TAKEN ROOT AND OVER THE LAST- TWO YEARS I'M PLEASED TO SAY WE HAD NO REGULATIONS PROJECT. OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE ONLY HAVE ONE SO WE MADE A BIG IMPROVEMENT GOING FROM 16% REJECTION RATES DOWN TO ZERO. SO THAT THAT'S IN A NUTSHELL WHAT THE PROCESSES I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. YES HE DID AND THEN- IS IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT I AM AS A GENERAL RULE IT TAKES SOMEWHERE. BETWEEN A YEAR TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS TECH GET THE- TO REACH THE FINAL APPROVAL. THAT IS CERTAINLY TO SAY I THINK WE WANTED ONE OF OUR- ONE OF THE CRITICISMS OF OUR PROCESS BEFORE WE IMPLEMENTED THE REGULATIONS UNIT IF THE DEPARTMENT DID NOT HAVE A GOOD TRACKING TOOL SO THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE REGULATIONS UNIT IMPLEMENTED WELL AS A TRACKING TOOL AND FOR TWENTY TWENTY ON AVERAGE- IT TOOK ABOUT TWENTY MONTHS SO A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN AND THEN YOUR AVERAGE OF EIGHTEEN. IT TOOK APPROXIMATELY TWENTY MONTHS FOR- BY THE PACKAGES TO CLEAR THE PROCESS FROM THE FIRST POINT IN TIME WHERE THE BORDERS APPROVING THAT TAX THAT I MENTIONED ALL THE WAY TO THE POINT THAT IS BEING SUBMITTED TO THE OFFICE OF THE MINISTER OF ALL. IN IN IS THAT WAS AT TWENTY MONTHS. BECAUSE OF THE OFFICE OF A- THAT AOL- IS IT WHAT IS IT INTERNAL. IF THAT TWENTY MONTHS IS THE IT ALL OF THOSE STEPS THAT I DESCRIBED IT'S- THE STEP OF. THEY WORK HOLDING A MEETING- DRAFTING TAXED- HAVING PUBLIC COMMENT ON THAT TEXT WORKING OUT THE DOCUMENT- THANK THINK ALONG THE LINES OF LIKE THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL DIGEST IN THE COMMITTEE MEMOS- WORKING UP THOSE DOCUMENTS TO SUPPORT THE REGULATION- THE FORTY FIVE DAY COMMENT PERIOD. THAT THE PUBLIC HAS AN OPPORTUNITY IN ALL CASES TO COMMENT ON REGULATIONS. THE THE WORK THAT HAPPENS ONCE THE PUBLIC IS COMMENTEDSOMETIMES THERE NEEDS TO BE CHANGES TO THE TAX BECAUSE THE PUBLIC HAS POINTED SOMETHING OUT OF THE NEEDS TO BE CHANGED. OR OTHER OR OTHER TIMES THE LAW DOES REQUIRE THAT WE RESPOND TO ALL COMMENTS ON REGULATIONS SO THAT TAKES SOME TIME OFTEN IS WRITING OUT RESPONSES TO COMMENTS- AND THEN SUBMITTING IT THROUGH TO THE AGENCY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND AWEIL. SO THAT'S THAT'S A TWENTY MONTH PROCESS. THANK YOU. SENATOR. WELL I'M SOMEWHAT CONCERNED WITH THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT IT TAKES TO MOVE A REGULATIONS THROUGH THE PIPELINE. YOU KNOW IF REGULATIONS ARE DESIGNED TO FILL IN THE GAPS IN STATUTES THAN. THEN YOU HAVE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MONTHS OF PERIOD OF TIME WE KNOW SOME OF THE STATUTES ARE IN EFFECT WERE. THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THEM AND THE BUSINESSES OR ENTITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE MAY MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY COMPLYING BECAUSE- OF COURSE THE GAPS ARE NOT FILLED IN. IN LOOKING AT OUR ANALYSIS I. MY EYES FROM THE SENSE THAT SAID THE ENHANCED REVIEW PROCESS IS ALSO LENGTH AND THE TIME NEEDED TO DEVELOP AND REVIEW FILES AND I ASSUME THAT MEANS REGULATORY FILES. WE HAVE- WE RECEIVE COMPLAINTS IN THE LEGISLATURE FROM. THE BOARDS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO- TO THESE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FROM TIME TO TIME OF COURSE I HAVE. ANOTHER JOB THIS YEAR THAT WILL CALL ON ME TO OR REQUIRE ME TO DEAL WITH BOARDS- AND REGULATIONS AND COMPLAINTS THAT ARISE FROM THE PROCESS SO. LET ME- THERE'S A COUPLE QUESTIONS IF I MAY. THE LEGAL AFFAIRS DIVISION IS THAT THE IS THAT THE DIVISION OF LAWYERS AND IS THAT THE SAME AS THIS. REGULATIONS UNIT THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HERE. IT IS YES OKAY. MY UNDERSTANDING WHEN I ASKED. OTHERS ABOUT THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES TO DO REGULATIONS INSIDE THE AGENCY IN THE DCA. WAS THAT THERE IS A PRE REVIEW PROCESS THAT OCCURS- BEFORE THE REGULATIONS ARE SUBMITTED TO. THE PUBLIC FOR COMMENT AND BEFORE REVIEW BY O. ALE IS THAT WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DESCRIBING THIS PRE REVIEW PROCESS. EFFECTIVELY YES SENATOR PROF. AND SO WHEN I ASKED FOR A MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION I WAS TOLD THAT- BOARD REGULATIONS- OF COURSE SIR DRAFTED UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE LEGAL AFFAIRS DIVISION BY THE VARIOUS BOARDS. AND THEN THEY NEED TO BE SENT TO DC AGE REGULATIONS COORDINATOR. THEN TO THE LEGAL AFFAIRS DIVISION AGAIN THEN TO DC AS BUDGET OFFICE BACK TO THE LEGAL AFFAIRS DIVISION THEN TO DCH LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REVIEW. I ASSUME THAT'S AN OFFICE. THE DCA EXECUTIVE OFFICE THEN TO THE AGENCY FOR WHATEVER THE AGENCY DOES AT THAT POINT. THEN BACK TO THE DCH REGULATION COORDINATOR AND BACK TO THE BOARD FOR THEN SUBMISSION I GUESS POSTING. FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND THEN ON TO- ALE FOR REVIEW. FOR INITIAL REVIEW AND THEN OF COURSE PUBLIC COMMENT HAS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT I ASSUME AT SOME POINT AND THEN ANY COMMENTS OF A WHALE NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION BEFORE REGULATIONS ULTIMATELY ARE FINALIZED PERHAPS GOING BACK THROUGH THIS PROCESS DOES THAT SORT OF ACCURATELY DESCRIBE SCRIBE AT LEAST WHAT'S BEEN PRESENTED TO ME ACTUALLY DESCRIBE. THE PRE REVIEW PROCESS WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE- IT IS. NOT ENTIRELY BUT- THEY'RE PART OF THE CHANGE IN THE REGULATIONS UNIT- WHY IS IT- ESSENTIALLY. THE CONCEPT IS EACH ATTORNEY IS ASSIGNED THE PORTFOLIO OF CLIENTS SO- ONE OF MY CLIENTS IS A BOARD AND I'M WORKING WITH THAT BOARD WHO ARE. OFTEN TIMES ALREADY HAS REGULATORY STAFF NOT ALWAYS BUT OFTEN TIMES. AND FOR THOSE LAWYERS BY THE WAY. I APOLOGIZE WHAT WAS THAT YOU SAY THEY HAVE THE BOARD HAS REGULATORY STAFFER YOU TALKING ABOUT REGULATORY ATTORNEYS. NOT ATTORNEYS USUALLY APPROACH YOU KNOW- PROGRAM ANALYST STAFF THAT ARE THAT ARE SOMEWHAT- THANKS MORE ON POLICY- THEY MAY BE FOCUSED ON PROCEDURAL ISSUES BUT- WE'RE GONNA GET A LOT OF OUR POLICY SUPPORT FROM THE BOARD STAFF ITSELF- AND SO THOSE. THOSE THAT TEAM IS WORKING TO DEVELOP REGULATORY TAXED- THE TEXT IS PRESENTED TO THE BOARD SOMETIMES BOARD HAVE NO COMMENTS ON TEXT- OF THE REGULATION MUCH LIKE STATUTES OTHER TIMESTHE BOARDS VERY MUCH ARE VERY INTERESTED IN THE IN THIS THE PRECISE WORDING OF A PARTICULAR REGULATION AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE INDUSTRY. AND SO USUALLY OUR ATTORNEYS WILL BE AT THOSE BOARD MEETINGS HELPING FACILITATE THAT CONVERSATION- OFTENTIMES WITH THE BOARD STAFF TO- AND THEN ONCE THAT TEXT IS SETTLED- IT DEPENDING ON THE CLIENT- SOME OF OUR CLIENTS HAVE MORE DEVELOPED REGULATIONS STAFF THAN OTHERS OF OUR CLIENTS AS I MENTIONED WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN DIFFERENT REGULATORY BODIES AT THIS DEPARTMENT- AND CHAU DEPENDING ON OUR CLIENT- WILL BE MORE OR LESS INVOLVED IN DRAFTING UP THE MAJOR REGULATORY DOCUMENTS AGAIN THE- THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL TYPE DIGEST. THAT COMMITTEE ANALYSES TYPE DOCUMENTS- WILL BE ENGAGED WITH THE CLIENTS AND DRAFTING KNOWS- THEY GO THROUGH A DEPARTMENTAL LEVEL REVIEW. THEY GO THROUGH WHICH INCLUDE THE LEGAL SIDE IN THE BUDGET SIDE. THEN THEY. GO THROUGH AN AGENCY LEVEL REVIEW. AND THEN THERE PUBLISHED SHE- THE- PUBLIC FOR NOW IT'S CHILDREN- THAT THE PROJECT STEP- IT GOING TO VARY FROM TIME TO TIME WE DON'T FOR INSTANCE HAVE THAT WAS ONE OF THE PROCESS CHANGES OF THE REGULATIONS UNIT. WAS WE CUT OUT THE LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS STEP THAT YOU DESCRIBED IN YOUR IN YOUR SUMMARY- WE'VE ALSO CUT OUT STEPS BOTH AT THE LEGAL DIVISION AND AT THE BUDGET OFFICE SO THAT THE PROCESS HAS CHANGED SOMEWHAT- FROM FROM THAT DESCRIPTION BUT ROUGHLY IT IS. THAT THE CONCEPT IS THE SAME WHICH IS. A SORT OF A SYMBIOTIC DEVELOPMENT OF REGULATIONS BETWEEN BOARDING DEPARTMENT. SHOULD MEANING FOR DEPARTMENTAL REVIEW SUBMITTING FOR AGENCY REVIEW. PUBLIC NOTICE. AND THEN. BACK TO. THAT SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP OF DEVELOPING THOSE FINAL DOCUMENTS. OR MENTAL REVIEW AGENCY REVIEW DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REVIEW. AND OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW ALSO YOUR PROCESS CHANGES THE PROCESS CHANGES THAT YOU SPEAK ABOUT DID THEY RESULT IN ANY REDUCTION IN YOUR PROCESSING TIME. SO AS I MENTIONED THAT WAS ONE OF THE CRITICISMS OF OUR OUR PROCESS BEFORE WAS WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE TRACKING SYSTEM ANECDOTALLY WE HAD HEARD THAT THERE WERE ABOUT TWO YEAR LONG. SAYS HE'S OF REGULATIONS SO IF WE WERE TO ASSUME THAT'S TRUE THEN WE'VE NOW REDUCED THAT BY ABOUT 20% DOWN TO- TWENTY TWENTY MONTHS THAT'S NOT OUR GOAL OUR GOAL IS TO KEEP IMPROVING ON THIS PROCESS- AND SO WE'RE HOPING TO KEEP CONTINUING TO NOT WALK AWAY AT THAT- BUT LIKE I SAID THIS IS BEEN. BASICALLY IMPLEMENTED NOW FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF A BIG A BIG PART OF THAT WAS WAS KIND OF IT WHERE WE TRANSITIONED. FROM WHAT WAS A PAPER HEAVY PROCESS AT TO YOU MUCH MORE FLUID ELECTRONIC PROCESS THESE PEOPLE WORKING FROM HOME- SO WE'VE WE'VE HAD TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS THAT WERE NOT ANTICIPATED BUT WE HAVE MADE THEM. AND SO WE'RE WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN CONTINUE MAKING IMPROVEMENTS AS I SAID OUR NUMBERS ARE SHOWING THAT WE'VE MADE IMPROVEMENTS SO I'M WE'RE WE'RE WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS AN ADDITIONAL TWO YEARS TO CONTINUE BUILDING ON WHAT WE STARTED. WELL MAKES OF JUST TO MY FLOWSHEET FLOW CHART BUT YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE DO YOU KNOW OF ANY OTHER. STATE TO STATE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY AT THE AGENCY AND DEPARTMENT LEVEL THAT UTILIZES THIS TYPE OF PROCESS TO PROMULGATE REGULATIONS. THE DETAIL PROCESS THAT I OUTLINED SUBJECT TO THE CHANGES THAT YOU INDICATED. WHAT I CAN'T SAY IT IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE DEPARTMENT I DID A PRETTY DEEP DIVE REGULATIONS REPORT AND PUBLISH THAT REPORTED ON THE DEPARTMENT'S WEBSITE IN THE COURSE OF DOING THAT THE APARTMENT LOOKED AT FIVE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND BOARDS AND SURVEY THEIR DIFFERENT PROCESS EASIER. IT IS TRUE THE DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES DO IT DIFFERENT WAYS DEPENDING ON THEIR MAKE UP THIS DEPARTMENT IS SOMEWHAT UNIQUE IN THAT IT'S COMPRISED OF LITTLE MANY DEPARTMENTS WITHIN A BIGGER DEPARTMENT- WHERE IT'S ONE OF THE POINT OF THE ENTITIES WE SURVEYED BUDGET RESOURCES SUPPORT. RESOURCES FOR DOESN'T HAVE THAT OVERSIGHT AT THAT WE DO WITH THIS DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS- BUT OTHER DEPARTMENTS WE LOOK AT BERMAN A PUBLIC HEALTH THEY HAVE CENTERS WHICH ARE SORT OF LIKE SMALL BOARDS AND SO THEY DO HAVE THE PROCESSES ARE NOT IDENTICAL TO WHAT I ESCRIBE BUT THEY DO HAVE KIND OF A- CENTER DEPARTMENT AGENCY LEVEL REVIEW ON REGULATIONS. SO THERE. ARE SOME COMPARABLE- TAMPA OUT THERE BUT PROBABLY NOTHING BIG. LIKE PCA IDEAS SOMEWHAT WAS SOMEWHAT UNIQUE IN STATE GOVERNMENT OF THE TIMELINE FOR THE AGENCY JUST REFERENCE HOW LONG ON AVERAGE DOES THAT AGENCY TAKE TO PROMULGATE REGULATIONS. SHOW THE DATE I DON'T RECALL THAT ONE OFF THE TOP BUT THE AVERAGE IS- FOR THE WHOLE GROUP THAT WE LOOKED AT THEY RANGE FROM BETWEEN. NINE MONTHS TO THREE TO FOUR YEARS OKAY WHERE IS THE BEERS THE ISSUE I'M NOT GONNA BELABORED HERE THIS YEAR AS YOU KNOW- I HAVE A DIFFERENT ASSIGNMENT THIS YEAR SO WE'LL HAVE THIS CONVERSATION IN A DIFFERENT FORM ON A DIFFERENT DATE. BUT MY QUESTION IS OBVIOUSLY WE ALL WANT PERFECTION IN STATE GOVERNMENT AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND. SO KUDOS TO YOU FOR FINDING IT IN THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT BUT I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT THE BALANCE I BALANCING. TOTAL PERFECTION WITH. A SPEEDY RESOLUTION AND DEVELOPING INFORMATION AND GETTING OUT TO THE CUSTOMER. WHO NEEDS TO HAVE IT IN ORDER TO KNOW HOW TO COMPLY WITH THE RULES THAT WE PUT IN PLACE HERE SO. I'M GOING TO BE LOOKING TO SEE WHAT SORT OF A- VALUE ADDED ANALYSIS THAT THE DEPARTMENT AND THE AGENCY HAS PERFORMED WITH RESPECT TO THIS REGULATORY PROCESS. TO ANALYZE FOR EXAMPLE WOULD VALUE ADDED TO IT IS IT TO HAVE THE AGENCY INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS AND AT WHAT POINT IN TIME. JUST AS ONE EXAMPLE SO. I LOOK FORWARD TO- HAVING A FURTHER CONVERSATION ON THIS ISSUE OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT- THIS IS A BUDGET ISSUE AND I'M NOT OPPOSED TO. GETTING ATTORNEYS PEKKA LOVE ATTORNEYS- SO I'LL MOVE ON BUT I'M SURE AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY HAVE A CONVERSATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR SHERIFF AYE MATE KID TRYING TO. FINANCED I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT NINETEEN TWENTY WAS THE FIRST YEAR THAT. THE- DEPARTMENT RECEIVED. INTO THE STAFF TO ESTABLISH THE NEW REGULATIONS UNIT. IT DID TAKE SOME TIME TO HIRE THE STAFF I'M TO START WORKING ON THIS. THE TWENTY MONTH TIMELINE THAT- YOU KNOW RYAN MENTIONED YOU KNOW BEFORE NINETEEN TWENTY WE WANT TO STRESS THAT- YOU KNOW THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR. CUBBON NINETEEN HIT THAT- REALLY HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT NOT JUST ON THE PARK BENCH BUT LIKE. FINANCED- I NOTICED IN A WELL AS OTHER DEPARTMENTS- JUST. IMPACT ON THEIR- WORKLOAD IN THE PROCESS USED TO. THAT IS PART OF THE REASON WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR THIS EXTENSION- BECAUSE WE FEEL THAT. THAT SORT OF ISSUES. BUT YOU KNOW ABSENT KEVIN NINETEEN- YOU KNOW ASK THE DEPARTMENT RAN SEVEN FULLY IMPLEMENT THIS- REGULATIONS UNIT- THAT THAT COULD HAVE YOU KNOW THAT THAT LIKELY WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IF WE DIDN'T HAVE BEEN NINETEEN SO WE- ARE REQUESTING TO EXTEND THIS FOR ANOTHER COUPLE YEARS- TO ALLOW YOU KNOW. STATE PROCESS USED TO BETTER JUST TO COVER NINETEEN AND FOR THE DEPARTMENT COLLECTS- MORE DATA- AND YOU KNOW FULLY HER THEIR STAFF FULLY IMPLEMENT THEIR REGULATIONS UNIT AND- WE'RE ANTICIPATING THAT TIMELINE- WILL PROBABLY. IMPROVE THANK THANK YOU FOR THAT COMMENT I APPRECIATE THAT THE THEIR REFLECTION ON A IMPACT TO PROVIDE. CENTER NIELSEN MANAGER I JUST HAVE TO REFLECT AT. THE CENTRE FROM RIVERSIDE IT ENQUIRIES OF BROUGHT A BIG SMILE TO MY FACE YOU CAN'T TELL BECAUSE OF. THE MASK THAT I WAS SMILING FROM EAR TO EAR. WHAT THIS HAS BECOME AS A EXAMPLE OF WHY HAPPENS WHEN SOMETHING GETS IN THE GOVERNMENT. IT'S MCCARTY THEN AND I HAD A GREAT IDEA. AND I JUST WATCHED HOWARD'S THE LITTLE TRACING OF THE PROCESS. IT IS GOTTEN SO CONVOLUTED. CUMBERSOME IT ALMOST IRRELEVANT- GOOD IDEAS GET TWISTED UP AROUND HERE AND IT'S JUST IT'S REALLY AMUSING I SUPPOSE BUT IT ISN'T AMUSING QUITE FRANKLY ON THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING REGULATED AND HASSLE. BY ALL OF THESE AGENCIES STAFF BUREAUCRATS IN ALL THIS DEMAND FOR MORE MORE INFORMATION. RELATED TO THE REGULATIONS WE OWE OUR CITIZENS A LOT BETTER THAN THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT COMMENT- WANT TO REMIND US THAT- THIS THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS HAS. ONE THIRTY SEVEN I GUESS THE STREET THIRTY EIGHT BUT NOW THIRTY SEVEN BURDEN BUREAUS AND- THAT WE THEY IMPLEMENT THE RULES IT. WE CREATE AND SO THE CHALLENGE IS GETTING THAT INTO THEM INTO A FORM THAT MAKES SENSE TO THE PUBLIC AND- I THINK WHAT WHAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT TODAY'S TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S A WAY TO BE ABLE TO DO A LITTLE BIT MORE EFFICIENTLY. AND- AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENT ABOUT. IT THIS BEING. IMPLEMENTED DURING THE ERA OF CODE- BLIGHTED CHANGES HAPPENED AND SO THIS IS A BUDGET ISSUE AND WE'RE GOING TO BE REVIEWING THIS. COMING BACK AT A LATER DATE THIS IS A HOLD UP OPEN ITEM AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION THAT YOU. PROVIDED TO US TODAY- I THINK WAS VERY HELPFUL TO ME TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THIRTY WHICH IS THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE REQUEST FOR THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD. HE THERE THE DEPARTMENT OR SOMEONE FROM THE BOARD. OF ESTIMATES FROM THE DEPARTMENT. GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS MIKE CHEN NASTY LEGISLATION SHE FOR THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD. SO IF YOUR MATERIALS PROVIDE THIS YEAR SO WE DOES HAVE A SEPARATE ACCOUNT IN THE BUDGET BILL YOU'RE A SEPARATE FROM ITS SPECIAL FUND. CALLED THE CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT EDUCATION ACCOUNT. IT IS FUNDED ENTIRELY BY VOLUNTARY DONATIONS ON CONTRACTOR LICENSE AND REGISTRATION RENEWALS. BY STATUTE IT DOES FUND CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT EDUCATION PROGRAMS I QUALIFY COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND CANNOT BE USED FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE. HI THE ACCOUNT IS CURRENTLY APPROPRIATE AT A HUNDRED THOUSAND BUT THERE IS PROJECTED TO BE OVER HALF A MILLION DOLLARS THERE BY THE END OF THE YEAR. SO THE BUDGET CHANGE A PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU TODAY DOES INCLUDE LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO AUGMENT THE APPROPRIATION IN A GIVEN YEAR BASED ON THE FUNDS ARE ACTUALLY AND THE ACCOUNT. SO THAT'S OUR LITTLE BACKGROUND TODAY I'M HERE WITH OUR LICENSING CHIEF IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS WE ARE CERTAINLY. AVAILABLE TO ANSWER THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ANY COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. CATEGORY FINANCE NOTHING FURTHER AT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ABOUT THE L. A. O. COMENT. SO IN ORDER ALMOST OFFICE WE DID NOT RAISE CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THERE ARE NO- QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS RAISED BY THE COMMITTEE THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO. THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS% CONTROL AND- ISSUE NUMBER THIRTY ONE ESTABLISHING THEIR APARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M KIMBERLY HARBISON FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND I'M JOINED BY MEMBERS OF THE FINANCE TEAM AS WELL AS COLLEAGUES. FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS PUBLIC HEALTH AND FOOD AND AGRICULTURE- SO THANK YOU FOR INVITING US HERE TODAY TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. TO CONSOLIDATE THE LICENSING COMPLIANCE AND REGULATORY OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS OF COMMERCIAL CANNABIS ACTIVITY IN CALIFORNIA. INTO A SINGLE DEPARTMENT. ALSO INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WILL CREATE THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL WITHIN THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY. EFFECTIVE JULY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. CREATING ONE POINT OF CONTACT WILL BETTER SERVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LICENSEES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS BY MAKING SURE THEY RECEIVE CONCISE CONSISTENT GUIDANCE FROM THE STATE. THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO SIMPLIFY PARTICIPATION IN THE LEGAL MARKET AND SUPPORT THE SUCCESSFUL AND SAFE OPERATION OF CANNABIS BUSINESSES IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SINGLE DEPARTMENT WILL REMOVE REDUNDANCIES PARTICULARLY AROUND LICENSING AND COMPLIANCE PROCESSES. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE LICENSING HAS PROVEN TO BE A CHALLENGING BARRIER TO ENTRY FOR SMALL OPERATORS AS WELL AS VERTICALLY INTEGRATED COMPANIES. PLACING ENFORCEMENT UNDER ONE DEPARTMENT WILL LEAD TO IMPROVED ENFORCEMENT COORDINATION AND CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE STATE TO MORE EFFECTIVELY APPLIANCE RESOURCES TO BETTER PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH SAFETY AND LANDS. CIBLE FIVE PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND ULTIMATELY MAKE IT MORE COSTLY AND INEFFICIENT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ILLICIT CANNABIS INDUSTRY. WE KNOW THAT A STRONG LEGAL MARKET AND LOCAL PARTICIPATION REDUCES THE ILLEGAL MARKET. HAVING ONE DEPARTMENT WILL SIMPLIFY THE STATE ADMINISTRATION OF REGULATING CANNABIS. I'M SORRY FOR EVERYTHING CANNABIS AND THIS WILL A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN UNDERSTANDING THE STATE FRAMEWORK AND BEING MORE WILLING TO ADOPT THAT FRAMEWORK IN THE RESPECTIVE LOCALITIES. ONE OF THE FIRST TEST OF THE NEW DEPARTMENT WILL BE A WILL BE TO HARMONIZE. THE THREE SETS OF EXISTING REGULATIONS INTO ONE. READING OFF OF ONE SET WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR INDUSTRY TO NAVIGATE AND THE STATE WILL HAVEA BETTER UNDERSTANDING. OF THE IMPACTS AND OUTCOMES OF THE STATE REGULATORY EFFORTS THROUGH MORE UNIFORM DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS. THIS WILL INVOLVE CONSOLIDATION RECONCILIATION AND STREAMLINING MORE APPROPRIATE. THIS PROPOSAL CREATES THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE NEW DEPARTMENT LARGELY BY MOVING POSITIONS AND FUNDING THAT ARE CURRENTLY SUPPORTING THE THREE EXISTING STATE CANNABIS LICENSING ENTITIES. TO THE NEW DEPARTMENT ON JULY FIRST. THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL REQUESTS SIX HUNDRED TWENTY ONE POSITIONS AND A HUNDRED FIFTY THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION. CANNABIS CONTROL FUND IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND THAT AMOUNT DECREASES BY SEVENTEEN POINT TWO MILLION TO A TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX POINT SIX MILLION IN TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE AND I'M GOING. SO OF THE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE POINT EIGHT NINE REQUESTED ONLY THREE POINT TWO MILLION IS NEW FUNDING. TO ESTABLISH THE DEPARTMENT AND THE REMAINING ONE HUNDRED FIFTY POINT SEVEN. THIS WILL CURRENT APPROPRIATIONS IN THE EXISTING DEPARTMENTS. WE WILL FOCUS ON CONTINUITY AND STABILITY FOR STAKEHOLDERS DURING THE TRANSITION TO THE CONTINUED USE OF THE CURRENT LICENSING SYSTEMS. AND THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS TRACK AND TRACE SYSTEM. AS WELL AS THROUGH INTERAGENCY AGREEMENTS WITH EXISTING DEPARTMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES. WHILE WE WORK TO STAND UP NEW DEPARTMENT OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. THE FUNDING DECREASED IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE THAT I NOTED ABOVE LARGELY REFLECTS THE PHASE OUT. OF THESE TRANSITIONAL INTERAGENCY AGREEMENTS. SO LIKEWISE OF THE SIX HUNDRED TWENTY ONE POSITIONS THAT WE REQUESTED. ONLY TWENTY THREE ARE NEW AND THE REST ARE CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED WITHIN THE THREE LICENSING ENTITIES. THE TRANSFER OF FIVE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT EXISTING POSITIONS WILL HELP THE NEW DEPARTMENTS RETAIN THE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE THAT RESIDE WITHIN THESE PROGRAMS TODAY. THE TWENTY THREE NEW POSITIONS ARE NEEDED TO FORM THE EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE OF THE NEW DEPARTMENT. CONSISTENT WITH THAT OF OTHER DEPARTMENTS OF SIMILAR SIZE. THESE POSITIONS WILL PROVIDE SOME EXECUTIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS CURRENTLY PERFORMED. WITHIN THE THREE EXISTING DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE NOT SPECIFIC TO CANNABIS AND WILL BE STAYING AT THE- HOME DEPARTMENTS THE LEGACY APARTMENTS. SO I'D ALSO LIKE TO. POINT OUT SPECIFICALLY THAT THE THREE DEPARTMENTS- ALL RECEIVE ONGOING FUNDING IN THEIR TWENTY TWENTY ONE MAYOR VISUAL BASIC PEACE BECAUSE WE HAD INITIALLY. PRESENTED THIS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET LAST YEAR BUT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC HOLD IT BACK SO WE'RE INTRODUCING OF THIS YEAR. SO THIS YEAR'S GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES COMPANION PROPOSALS. AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS PUBLIC HEALTH AND FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. TO REDUCE ENTRANCE FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE CANNABIS RESOURCES TO THE DEPARTMENT. ASSEMBLY A PROPOSED STATUTORY CHANGES TO EFFECTUATE THE CONSOLIDATION AND MAKE RELATED IMPROVEMENTS WHERE POSSIBLE ONE ITEM OF NOTE FOR THE COMMITTEE IS OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. WILL RETAIN THE CANNABIS-APPELLATIONS PROGRAM. THE- CAL PROGRAMS WHICH WILL ESTABLISH STANDARDS FOR CANNABIS COMPARABLE TO THE NATIONAL ORGANIC PROGRAM WILL ALSO BE RETAINED WITHIN FOR AN AGRICULTURE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND WILL CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM THEIR EXISTING EXPERTISE. IN CLOSING WE WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS THE FIRST STEP IN MOVING TOWARD A UNIFIED APPROACH TO CANNABIS WITHIN CALIFORNIA. THIS EFFORT IS ABOUT TRYING TO REMOVE BARRIERS AND PAIN POINTS FOR SMALL OPERATORS FACE CHALLENGES ENTERING THE CANNABIS SPACED AND PROVIDING EFFICIENCY IS REPORTEDLY INTEGRATED COMPANIES AND OTHER OPERATORS. THIS IS NOT AN UP FRONT COST SAVINGS EXERCISE BUT MAINLY TO SAVINGS OVER TIME AS KNOWLEDGES CENTRALIZED ACTIVITIES ARE INTEGRATED IN PROCESSES BECOME MORE EFFICIENT. WE RECOGNIZE THIS EFFORT WILL REQUIRE ADJUSTMENTS AFTER THE INITIAL ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT AND IT IS OUR INTENT TO PROVIDE CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS. AND SERVICES DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD. THREE OF EXPERT TO THE TRANSFER EXISTING. FROM THE THREE CANNABIS ENTITIES SHE THEN. DEPARTMENT WILL IN THIS GOAL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND WE'RE ALL HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ANY COMMENTS CONCERNS. YEAH THAT WAS ME DEPARTMENT FINANCIAL I'M SORRY YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT I'M BASED OUT- IT LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. SORT OF BORED THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE FIRST OF ALL WE RECOMMEND APPROVING THE CONSOLIDATION BECAUSE WE AGREE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THE CURRENT STRUCTURE IS PROBLEMATIC CURRENTLY THERE'S NO LEAD AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULATING CANNABIS IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO KNOW WHO TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE AS WELL AS FOR LICENSEES TO KNOW WHO TO INTERACT WITH IF THEY HAVE MULTIPLE LICENSE TYPES. ACCORDINGLY WE THINK CONSOLIDATION HAS SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE REGULATION OF CANNABIS IN THE STATE- HOWEVER WE RECOMMEND THAT THE RESOURCES BE APPROVED ONLY ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE ONGOING NEED FOR RESOURCES AREN'T CLEAR. RIGHT NOW THE CANNABIS MARKET IS STILL IN THE PROCESS OF MATURING AND THIS CAN BE SEEN BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF LICENSES ARE THAT WAY SINCE HE IS THAT EACH OF THE ENTITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR HAS FLUCTUATED QUITE A BIT IN RECENT YEARS. AND ACCORDINGLY WORKLOAD COULD BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN ASSUMED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. IN ADDITION AS WAS REFERENCED- THE NEW STRUCTURE COULD CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES NEEDED ON THE ONE HAND- THE NEW STRUCTURE COULD CREATE EFFICIENCIES OVER TIME. THAT WILL WORK WITH THAT WOULD REDUCE OVERALL NEED FOR RESOURCES AND ON THE OTHER HAND IT COULD INCREASE THE NEED FOR RESOURCES PARTICULARLY IF THE NEW DEPARTMENT. OF CHANGES THE WORLD THE- WE IT PRIORITIZES THE ACTIVITIES AGAIN ENGAGES AND FOR EXAMPLE THE NEW DEPARTMENT MIGHT DECIDE THAT IT NEEDS TO PLACE MORE EMPHASIS ON ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST ON LICENSE ACTIVITY AND THAT WOULD REQUIRE REBALANCING. OF RESOURCES WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. ACCORDINGLY WE READ. THAT THE PHONE. ONLY BE APPROVED ON A THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS IS THIS WOULD GIVE TIME FOR THE CANNABIS MARKET TO MAKE SURE. AND FOR THE EFFECTS OF THE CONSOLIDATION TO BE MADE CLEAR. IN ADDITION WE'RE ALSO RECOMMENDING- REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT TO DO A WORK LOAD REPORT. ON THAT WOULD COMPARE THE AMOUNT OF WORKLOAD- SOON FOR EACH POSITION WITH THE ACTUAL WORKLOAD EXPERIENCED BY THOSE POSITIONS. AS WELL AS DESCRIBING ANY CHANGES IN THE NEED. FOR RESOURCES DUE TO THE CONSOLIDATION WE RECOMMEND THAT THIS REPORT TO BE DELIVERED TO THE LEGISLATURE ON NOVEMBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE. SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE TIME TO CONSIDER IT AS PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE BUDGET PROCESS. ONE UNDER OUR RECOMMENDATION THE LIMITED TERM FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT WOULD EXPIRE THIS WOULD GIVE THE LEGISLATURE THE INFORMATION IT WOULD NEED TO MAKE. A DETERMINATION ABOUT THE ON GOING LEVEL OF RESOURCES NEEDED FOR THE DEPARTMENT. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY UESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR- THOSE COMMENTS TEKASHI TO VERY MUCH- I HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT I CAN I CAN GO THROUGH PRETTY QUICKLY- LET ME START% OFF BY SAYING GIVEN THAT GIVING GIVEN THAT THE FUNDING TO SUPPORT ALL OF THE- OF THE RESOURCES. IS DERIVED FROM LICENSE FEES WHAT IS IT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN TO ENSURE THERE ISN'T A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN LICENSED BUSINESSES AS WE APPROACH THE SUNSET ON PROVISIONAL LICENSES. THANK THAT WOULD GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO HAND IT OFF TO ONE OF OUR DEPARTMENT REPRESENTATIVES. RICHARD YOU NEVER WALK AGAIN- WERE SPONSORED THAT THANK YOU SURE CABALLERO. WITH REGARD TO GET BACK THAT- LICENSE YOU SUPPORT HE- THE OPERATIONS OF THE PROGRAMS AND WITH THE- LOOKING SUNSET DATE FOR PROVISIONAL LICENSES ALL OF THE LICENSING AUTHORITIES CONTINUE TO SEE. NEW APPLICATIONS AND- WE ARE DILIGENTLY WORKING TO ISSUE LICENSES I'M ALWAYS LOOKING TO MISSION ANNUAL LICENSE. IF WE ARE ABLE TO. WHAT WE ARE FOR I. WE'RE DOING IN OUR TO REVIEW THOSE PROFESSIONALS WHEN THEY CAN BE RENEWED AND ALL A- WITH THE INDUSTRY TO TRANSITION OF THOSE PROVISIONAL LICENSES TO HANDLE LICENSES. ON THERE ARE SEVERAL FACTORS THAT. COME INTO PLAY IN GETTING RELICENSING LICENSE- WE DO NEED TO WORK ON HAVING- LOCAL AUTHORIZATION AND SEE FOR PAROLE- ON ALSO IT'S REALLY DEPENDING ON THE QUALITY AND THOROUGHNESS OF THE APPLICATION- BUT WE EXPERIENCED THIS WHEN WE HAD TEMPORARY LICENSES AND WE- TRANSITION. POLICYHOLDERS MEANS YOU RENTAL LICENSES TO WORK IN MINOR WITH WORKING WITH THE INDUSTRY TO ENSURE THAT LICENSEES DO NOT FALL OUT OF OUR LICENSURE STATUS I WILL EXPERIENCE THAT WE NEED- TOWARD THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN. AND ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT THERE IS LEGISLATION CURRENTLY OUT THERE TO CONTEMPLATE EXPANDING SUNSET ON THE PROVISIONAL LICENSING- ACCORDING. VERY GOOD- I THINK THERE WAS SOMETHING. OVER SIXTY OF THE LAW IS A PER SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY- THAT THEY DON'T. EXPIRE BECAUSE- WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THE WE STILL HAVE A VERY ROBUST BLACK MARKET- IN THIS AREA SO LET ME LET ME GO ON TO SOME OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS WHAT ARE SOME OF THE EFFORTS OF THE ADMINISTRATION IS DOING TO ENCOURAGE BUSINESSES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE LEGAL MARKET. AND THEN- IN IN IT AND THEN THE SAME QUESTION WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ENCOURAGE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PERMIT CANNABIS WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CHAIRED A KIMBERLY HARVEST AND AGAIN FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO I THINK THERE ARE A FEW- BUCKETS OF THINGS THAT WE WOULD. SAY ARE WHAT WE'RE DOING TO SUPPORT EDUCATE LITTLE BUSINESSES. AND THOSE WOULD FALL INTO TAX RELIEF. FUNDING ENFORCEMENT AND PUBLIC RELATIONS AND EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH SETTLED FOR TAX RELIEF- THERE'S A TEMPORARY FREEZE ON THE EXCISE TAX MARKUP THAT WAS PASSED IN TWENTY TWENTY- WE FROZEN INCREASES THE CULTIVATION TAX INFLATION ADJUSTMENTS. MODIFIED THE TAX CODES IN THE CANNABIS BUSINESSES CAN TAKE BUSINESS TAX DEDUCTIONS LIKE ANY OTHER LEGAL BUSINESSES CAN. AND WE'VE ALSO- PUBLICLY COMMITTED JUST CONSIDER PROPOSALS AIMED AT REFORMING THE TAX STRUCTURE- IF FOLKS WOULD LIKE TO SUBMIT THOSE. AFTER FUNDING WE COME IN FIFTY FIVE MILLION IN EQUITY FUNDING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THAT GOES TO. LOCAL EQUITY APPLICANTS AND LICENSEES- AND WE'RE SEEKING TO COMMIT ANOTHER FIFTEEN MILLION. IN THIS BUDGET- YES YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE GOVERNOR ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER LAST YEAR. DECLARING THAT CANNABIS BUSINESSES WERE ESSENTIAL IN ROUTE WERE ALLOWED TO REMAIN REMAIN OPEN DURING THE PANDEMIC- THIS RECOGNIZES THE HISTORIC MEDICINAL NATURE CANNABIS. ENSURE CONTINUOUS ACCESS TO SAFE TESTED PRODUCTS FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN PURCHASING- TRAIN FOR STUDENTS THAT WE HAVE ENHANCED FINES AGAINST ILLEGAL OPERATORS THAT WAS. AB NINETY SEVEN TWENTY NINETEEN. AND WE HAVE SOME NEW SWORN OFFICERS POSITIONS AT THE BUREAU TO COME COMBAT LISTEN ACTIVITY. FOR OUTREACH- WE DO ONE ON ONE INTERACTIONS WE ARE HELP DESKS THAT FOLKS CAN CALL INTO. THAT INVOLVES LICENSING STAFF AND COMPLIANCE TEAMS- THEIR EDUCATIONAL TOOLS AND OTHER MATERIALS AVAILABLE AND THERE ALSO ARE SOME EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGNS LIKE. THIS IS CALIFORNIA CANNABIS LET'S TALK CANNABIS AND. TO GET WAIT WHY IS. FOR YOUR SECOND PART OF THE- WITH REVENUE AND TAXATION COUNTY. BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS RECEIVES AN ALLOCATION FOR THE CANNABIS TAX FUND. FOR MAKING LOCAL MAKING GRANTS TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES CERTAIN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ASSIST WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRE PROTECTION OR OTHER LOCAL PROGRAMMING. TO ADDRESS PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY RELATED TO LEGALIZATION OF CANNABIS IN CALIFORNIA. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN APPLY FOR THIS FUNDING TO THE BOARD IF THEY HAVE NOT IF THEY HAVE NOT BANNED BOTH INDOOR AND OUTDOOR CULTIVATION. OR BAND RESULT. RETAIL SALES. OR CANNABIS PRODUCTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES AN ESTIMATED SIXTY POINT TWO MILLION FOR THE BOARD'S PUBLIC. HEALTH AND SAFETY GRANT PROGRAM- THE BOARD APPROXIMATELY TEN MILLION TO TEN JURISDICTIONS. AND THE FIRST COHORT AND THEY'RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON MAKING. THE OTHER FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE FOR COHORT TWO AND THAT'S A COMPETITIVE PROCESS. VERY GOOD IF I COULD GET A COPY OF THAT INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE TERRIFIC JUST TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER WHAT. WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THOSE RESOURCES AND WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO THAT WOULD I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT- IN AND I'M JUST KIND OF ON GENERAL PRINCIPLE- I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS FOR CONSOLIDATIONS OR THE PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN USED IN THE PAST TO GO THROUGH THAT LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION- IT'S HARD TO DO CONSOLIDATIONS THROUGH THE BUDGET BECAUSE- THERE'S NOT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IN PUBLIC PARTICIPATION THAT ONE WOULD WOULD HAVE IF- IF THIS WAS GOING THROUGH. A- A- TRADITIONAL LEGISLATIVE POLICY PROCESS. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME IS THAT THERE BE THIS FULL FLEDGED DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PARTICIPANTS THAT THE LICENSEES CURRENT AND FUTURE. AND THE COMMUNITY SO THAT WE KNOW THAT. THIS CONSOLIDATION IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF EVERYONE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE AN EX IS AS SMOOTH AS EXPEDITIOUSLY. AS POSSIBLE AND THAT WE DON'T END UP KILLING A FLEDGLING INDUSTRY- THAT HAS WORKED HARD TO BRING ITSELF INTO INTO LEGAL COMPLIANCE AND INSTEAD- CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE BLACK MARKET TICKET. TO CONTINUE TO GROW AND TO THEM. AND BE MORE SUCCESSFUL SO I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IT IT'S GOING TO WORK AND- AND I'LL BE LOOKING AT THAT IS S.
