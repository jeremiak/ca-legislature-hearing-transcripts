THIS IS FILE ITEM NUMBER. SEVENTY AB ONE FORTY SEVEN COVERAGE. ASSEMBLY BILL ONE FORTY SEVEN BY SOMETHING MEMBER BURKE AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY TO TAXATION DECLARING THE URGENCY THERE UP TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. MEMBERS PLEASE GIVE YOUR ATTENTION TO MS BURKE MS BURKE YOU MAY OPEN. WORKING THIS BURKE YOU MAIL. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AT AB ONE FORTY SEVEN IS BACK ON CONCURRENCE THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A COMPREHENSIVE AND BALANCED SET OF POST WAY FAIR TAX COLLECTION RULES. THAT MAKE SENSE FOR CONSUMER SMALL BUSINESS AND THE STATE THE BILL IS BACK FOR CONCURRENT AND SENATE AMENDMENTS AMONG OTHER THINGS THESE AMENDMENTS SPECIFY THAT A DELIVERY NETWORK COMPANY AS DIVINE DEFINED IS NOT A MARKET PLACE FACILITATOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL. AT ADDS REFERENCE TO RELATED PARTIES TO RANK GAMING OF APPLICABLES THRESHOLD AND PROVIDE AN EXPLICIT EXEMPTION FOR NEWSPAPERS INTERNET WEBSITES THEY DO NOW MORE THAN LIST THE PROPERTY FOR SALE. THIS BILL THE PRODUCT OF A ROBUST STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO THAT AND I WOULD LIKE TO THINK MY PARTNER SENATOR MCGUIRE AND IT COMMITTEE STOP CALLING. GRENELL AND DAVID ROUGH FOR THEIR WORK SO CLOSELY WITH ME AND THE STAFF TO GET THIS WHERE WE ARE TODAY WITH THAT I RECALL. WITH RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MS BURKE MISTER OVER NOTI YOUR RECOGNIZE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB. ONE FORTY SEVEN I THINK THIS BILL LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD BETWEEN RETAIL BUSINESSES AND BUSINESSES THAT SHIP INTO THE STATE AND SO IT'S A VERY GOOD -- IDEA HOWEVER WANTED TO RISE AND CALL ATTENTION TO WHAT I CONSIDER A BIG IN EQUITY AND THE WAY THE SALES TAX REVENUE IS DISTRIBUTED AS REGARDS ONLINE SALES AT THIS BILL IS REGULATING. PEOPLE ARE AWARE THAT ARE SICK CALIFORNIA SALES TAX IS COLLECTED INTO PORTIONS IS A STATE PORTION OF THE LOCAL PORTION CALLED THE BRADLEY BIRDS PORTION. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT FOR AN ONLINE SALE. THE CITY AND COUNTY THAT ARE ENTITLED TO THE BRADLEY BURNS PORTION DEPENDS ON THE PHYSICAL LOCATION OF WHERE THE SALE TOOK PLACE SO FOR RETAIL SALES IT'S VERY CLEAR IF YOU BUY SOMETHING A STORE HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO WE'LL GET THAT REVENUE BUT FOR AN ONLINE SALE IT'S MUCH LESS CLEAR AND RIGHT NOW THE WAY THE CALIFORNIA STATE LAW READS. THE PEOPLE THAT GET THE ON THE BARELY PRINCE PORTION OF THE LOCAL SALES TAX IS DEPENDS ON WHERE THEY ARE. SHIPMENT ORIGINATES FROM NOT WHERE TO SHIP TO SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS CITIES WITH LARGE DISTRIBUTION CENTERS IN THE STATE ARE GETTING ALL OF THIS TAX REVENUE BACK AT STARVING THE CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT DON'T HAVE DISTRIBUTION CENTERS WITHIN THEM. SO IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR MADE A RECOMMENDATION THAT WE ADDRESS THIS INEQUITY WE HAVE NOT DONE THAT YET. BUT IT'S CAUSING TERRIBLE BEHAVIOR WE'RE SEEING CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT ARE ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS WERE THE REBATE AS MUCH AS 90% OF THAT TAX BACK TO THESE CORPORATIONS THAT ARE LOCATING THESE ONLINE CENTERS. IN THEIR COMMUNITIES SO I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION AND GET THAT REVENUE OUT OF THE POCKETS OF BIG CORPORATIONS AND BACK TO THE CITIES AND COUNTIES WHERE IT BELONGS SO WITHOUT. HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND I WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE THIS BODY TO ACT ON THIS IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU MISS ROBIN ULTI SAY NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ON THE ITEM IS BURKE YOU MAY CLOSE IF YOU WISH I THANK MY COLLEAGUE FOR HIS SUPPORT I ALSO LIKE TO THINK THE SPONSOR STATE TREASURER FIELD I'M OFF FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. ISSUE AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. NAME IS BURKE AND WITH THAT THE CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS ARE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTER DESIRED ABOUT.

ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD THERE ABOUT ALMOST TWO MILLION MILITARY SONS AND DAUGHTERS WHO SERVED THEIR NATION ALONG WITH THEIR PARENTS WHENEVER A PARENT IS DEPLOYED.
