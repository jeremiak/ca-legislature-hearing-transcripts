GOOD AFTERNOON I'M CALLING THE JOINT INFORMATION HEARING OF THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEES. TO ORDER I KNOW SENATOR ALLEN IS EXPECTED TO BE HERE BUT WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE THIS ROOM TILL FOUR. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET ALL THE TOPICS COVERED. I'D LIKE TO OPEN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THE PUBLIC TO WHAT I EXPECT WILL BE A VERY. INFORMATIVE. HEARING. IN ONE I JUSTICE CENTER MORE ELECTED YOU WISH TO SHARE ANY THOUGHTS BEFORE I CAN GO THROUGH SOME OKAY. MEDICAID IF YOU DO. SPEAK UP BY IN TWENTY THIRTEEN CALIFORNIA ADOPTED A NEW LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AND LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR A NEW SYSTEM OF SCHOOL ACCOUNTABILITY. AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT. THAT'S SYSTEM WHICH IS BASED ON USING MULTIPLE MEASURES INSTEAD OF A SINGLE NUMERICAL NUMBER TO MEASURE EFFECTIVENESS CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING MAJOR COMPONENTS. THE REQUIREMENT OF THE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES ADOPT AND ANNUALLY REVISE THE LOCAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS THE ACCOUNTS. THE REQUIREMENT FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION REVIEW AND APPROVE SCHOOL DISTRICT L. CAPS. NEW COMMON CORE ALIGNED ASSESSMENTS INCLUDING THE S. BACK WHICH IS ADMINISTERED IN GRADES THREE THROUGH EIGHT AND ELEVEN. THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE OFTEN CALLED C. C. E.. WHICH IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH NINE PILOT TEST DISTRICTS ONE OF WHICH WILL HEAR FROM TODAY AND THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING APPROACH. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. THE ADOPTION OF A DASHBOARD TO DISPLAY SCHOOL AN ALLEY A PERFORMANCE. ACROSS MULTIPLE MEASURES AND THE USE OF THE DASHBOARD IN THE FALL. TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO IDENTIFY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE NEED OF DIFFERENTIATED. PERFORMANCE. WE'RE NOW IN THE PROCESS OF ADDING ANOTHER COMPONENT TO OUR ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM WHICH IS THE STATE ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN REQUIRED BY THE SL EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACT OF COURSE THAT BEING THE FEDERAL LAW. AND FINALLY THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED ADDING TO OUR STATE SYSTEM BY CREATING REGIONAL SYSTEMS OR AMONG COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. AND SPECIAL EDUCATION LOCAL PLANNING AREAS THE SOLE PURPOSE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING TODAY IS TO GET AN OVERVIEW ON WHERE WE'VE BEEN AND WHERE WE ARE AND WHERE WORLD WHERE WE ARE GOING AND WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT ME AS CHAIR OF THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. IS WE GET MANY BILLS YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT WE CREATE ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE ONE IF IF YOU'RE IN THE SERENE ABOUT A EVEN LEGISLATORS. IN THIS BUILDING. DO NOT KNOW WHAT THIS PLANET SO THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING IS TO INFORM STAFF INFORMED LEGISLATORS AND OF COURSE BEYOND. OF THIS EFFORT AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO THE SET SECURE YOUR SUCCESS IN CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN. AND THE FACT IS THIS IS BEING WATCHED WE ARE THE MODEL FOR THE NATION. PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT WHAT WE ARE DOING WITH THEIR LCF HALF AND BEYOND IN OUR ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM TO TRY TO IT CLOSE THAT ACHIEVEMENT BET GAP. BECAUSE I. I THINK ALL BUSINESS ROOM NO THERE'S NOT ONE THING. YOU CAN DO TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP IF THERE WAS A FLIP YOU COULD SWITCH ARE THERE SWITCHED FLIP WE WOULD HAVE ALREADY DONE IT. GAME WE TRIED MANY APPROACHES WE DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW THE PERFECT WAY TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP I ASSURE YOU AS WE SIT HERE LOOKING AT THAT CLOCK. IT'S WATAN PROBABLY FIFTH PERIOD. RIGHT IN MANY CLASSES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND TEACHERS ARE TRYING. TO MOVE STUDENTS FORWARD AND IN MANY CASES CLOSE THAT ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND IT IS OUR JOB TO SUPPORT THEM. AND THIS NEW SYSTEM IS AN STF AFFECTS NOT SACRAMENTO CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA ITS LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. WE TRIED. ACCOUNTABILITY AND MICROMANAGEMENT ON STEROIDS FOR A LOT OF YEARS AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IT DID NOT WORK I LIVED IT. IN THE CLASSROOM. MY SELF ASA TODAY WE TURN THE CORNER TRYING A NEW APPROACH MORE ORGANIC ORGANIC APPROACH A BOTTOM UP APPROACH. AND THAT'S WHAT TODAY'S HEARING IT IS ABOUT. AND. I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS INTERESTING I'M LEARNING A LOT EVEN AS ONE OF THE CLASS OF A LOT OF YOURS I DIDN'T ALL UNDERSTAND THIS ACCOUNTABILITY. APPROACH SO SO THIS IS A UNIQUE NEW AND INTERESTING AND HERE WE GO CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BEING HERE TODAY. ALL. GREAT OF ALL THREE. GREAT SO AGAIN THANK YOU. FOR BEING HERE. NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND IS GONE WE'VE LEFT THAT BEHIND RUN TO SOME NEW IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT SO HERE WE GO. BECAUSE FIRST WILL BRING UP AN OVERVIEW OF THE SYSTEM. OF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT THAT'LL BE CARRICK ASHLEY. DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION OF PERFORMANCE PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY BRANCH. COME ON UP CARE OF ALL CALL THE NAMES OF THOSE OF YOU JUST COME UP TO NEXT FEATURE THE CHARACTER LONG BEACH GUY. STILL HIS FAMILY DOWN THERE IN THE LONG BEACH EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM FOR SURE FAMOUS LONG BEACH FAMILY. AND. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S AS A STATE PLAN THAT'LL BE OUR MAGRITTE. OF RICE. RE SOME SORRY FEDERAL POLICY. LAYS ON CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. ALRIGHT THANK YOU AND THEN MONITORING LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY OUTCOMES. DAVID. SAP I BELIEVE TO SAP. DEPUTY DA POLICY DIRECTOR AND ASSISTANT LEGAL COUNSEL STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. AND STEPHANIE. GREGSON I HOPE I SAID THAT CRACKED A CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCES DIVISION CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND I THINK WE'LL START WITH YOU MISTER ACTUALLY. AND AGAIN IF YOU JUST STICK TO THE TIMELINE THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION. A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WANT TO SHARE THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION THIS IS KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY IN A. IN A BOX TODAY BECAUSE YOU WON'T MAKE SURE WE COVER OUR BASES HERE BECAUSE AGAIN WHEN I THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. WHEN PEOPLE OPPOSE OUR BILLS ARE GONNA SAY WATCH THE ACCOUNTABILITY HEARING SO I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BEING HERE YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. RIGHT ON. WELCOME THIS AFTERNOON TO. HE WAS APPROVED. I CARE ACTUALLY THAT. CALIFORNIA. LISTEN I HAVE. THE ONLY THING THAT WE STARTED HEARING ACKNOWLEDGING. HIS STRUGGLE. LIKE IT'S STRUGGLE. TNCS. I QUALITY. BOSTON'S. CRITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY SO. LOCAL CONTROL. PLAN THAT EMPHASIZED. AREAS MOVEMENT BY. SURE. ALSO. WELL AS I PRESIDENT OBAMA NGUYEN. CALIFORNIA ALREADY BEFORE HIS. ACCOUNTABILITY. SPEAR HEADED BY THERE AM SPEARHEADED BY THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AND A DOCUMENT THAT'S CALLED THE BLUEPRINT FOR GREAT SCHOOLS. THAT WAS. AUTHORED BY A AND IT THE TO ADVISORY GROUP A TO THE SUPERINTENDENT. THAT WHEN WE MADE A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN THE WAY THAT WE FUND SCHOLS AND DISTRICTS IN THE LOCAL DECISION MAKING THAT WE GAVE YOU THAT WE'VE GIVEN TO SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS AND THE ASSISTANCE THAT WE PROVIDE TO THEM. SO CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT WE TO UNDERSTAND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT IT BE IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTAND WHERE WE CAME FROM AND TO KNOWLEDGE WHERE WE CAME FROM AND WHERE WE ARE NOW. SO UNDER NCLB NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND OF FEDERAL LAW AND PRIOR TO. LCF PFAFF WE HAD AN ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM THAT WAS FEDERALLY DRIVEN. IT WAS A VERY PRESCRIPTIVE. I WANT YOU WERE IDENTIFIED FOR ASSISTANCE AND YOUR ONE YOU HAD TO DO SPECIFIC THINGS IN YOUR TO YET TO DO SPECIFIC THINGS. THAN THERE WERE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS IN IT WAS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. WE WAS AN OVER RELIANCE ON THAT SYSTEM ON TEST SCORES. TEST SCORES AND GRADUATION RATES WERE THE ONLY PART OF THAT ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. IN IT WAS A SYSTEM OF CONSEQUENCES YOU BASICALLY TESTS SKIDS AND PROVIDE JUDGMENT ON HOW THAT TESTING WENT. UNDER THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AND THE FLEXIBILITY THAT'S PROVIDED UNDER. SUCCEEDS ACT. IT WE'VE NOW MOVED TO AN ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM OF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT WHICH IS STATE DRIVEN NOT FEDERALLY DRIVEN IT'S BASED ON MULTIPLE MEASURES NOT MOSTLY TEST SCORES LIKE NCLB. AND PROVIDING IN THOSE. MULTIPLE MEASURES A CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD THAT PROVIDES FOR EVERY SCHOOL IN EVERY DISTRICT IN MULTIPLE AREAS HOW THAT'S IS THAT SCHOOL IS PERFORMING NOT JUST CURRENTLY. BUT. IN TREND DATA AS WELL FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR TO NOW. NOT ONLY THAT THE THE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM WITH THE DASHBOARD PROVIDES FOR LOCAL INDICATORS AS WELL AS STATE INDICATORS FOR STATE INDICATORS HAVE STATED THAT THE STATE HAS IN THE STATE MAKE SOME SOME CALCULATIONS INSTANT TENDER DETERMINATIONS. AND PROVIDE SOME DATA BACK TO COMMUNITIES ON HOW THEY'RE DOING. BUT WE ADD TO THAT AN ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM HAS LOCAL INDICATORS BECAUSE THERE'S INFORMATION OUT THERE THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THE STATE. LOCAL DATA SUCH AS HOW OUR SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS IMPLEMENTING THE STANDARDS HOW ARE THEY DOING PROVIDING QUALITY TEACHERS. TO THEIR STUDENTS HOW ARE THEY DOING ENGAGING THEIR COMMUNITY AND THE SCHOOL AND THE SCHOOL CLIMATE OR THE DISTRICT CLIMATE AND WITHIN THAT ELLIE A. AND THEN ALL OF THAT IS BASED ON A CYCLE OF IMPROVEMENT. A A SYSTEM THAT STARTS WITH ASSESSMENT LOOKING AT DATA. THE DELIVERY OF SOME SERVICE SOME DESIGN OF THE SERVICES AND DELIVERY OF THOSE SERVICES AND THEN YOU EVALUATE HOW YOU'RE DOING AND START THE CYCLE OVER AGAIN TAKING A LOOK AT THE DATA THAT YOU HAVE. TO MAKE A DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER YOU SHOULD REDESIGN WHAT YOU'VE PREVIOUSLY DONE. SO ALL OF THAT. OR IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM BUT THEN ON NEXT TO THAT IS THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT LATER BUT JUST SOME AN OVERVIEW OF THE DIFFERENCES OF SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT. FROM THE FEDERAL SYSTEM OF NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND TO WHERE WE ARE NOW UNDER LCF AFTER NASA. UNDER THE OLD SYSTEM VERY UNEVEN RESULTS THERE WAS SOME SUCCESS BUT IT WAS LIMITED SUCCESS WE GAVE LARGE GRANTS. PER OF THE FEDERAL LAW TO INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS. WHICH WAS FINE AND SOME OF THEM SHOULD SOME OF THEM EVEN SHOWED IMPROVEMENT BUT ONCE THE MONEY ONE AWAY. OFTEN THE IMPROVEMENT WENT AWAY AS WELL BECAUSE IT DIDN'T FOCUS ON SYSTEMIC RESULTS AND IT DIDN'T FOCUS ON WORKING WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. COULD WHICH COULD HELP THE SCHOOL OVER TIME. TO MAKE THOSE GAINS A LONG TERM AND SUSTAINABLE. THE. IT OFTEN FOCUSED ON TEAMS COMING FROM THE OUTSIDE DROPPING INTO A SCHOOL AND THEN TRYING TO SOMEHOW ASSIST THEM AND WHAT TO DO. AND IT IT IT ESTABLISH MORE OF A CHECKLIST APPROACH THAN A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH. SO THATWAS THE OLD SYSTEM UNDER THE NEW SYSTEM OF SUPPORT UNDER LCF AFFAN THE LIMITED FLEXIBILITY THAT AS A GIVES US. ONE THERE'S MORE DATA AVAILABLE TO THE SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT. MORE IN THE DASHBOARD. THESE ARE KNOWN PARTNERS BECAUSE THE FIRST LINE OF INTERVENTION IS WITH THE COUNTY OFFICES COUNTY OFFICES ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT APPROVED THEIR BUDGET ANDREA AB TWELVE UNDER. THEIR THE ONES THAT PROVE THEIR LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN ANNUALLY SO THEY'RE ALREADY WELL. IT WELL KNOWN TE TO THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT SO IT'S NOT JUST SOMEONE DROPPING IN FROM THE OUTSIDE THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE CONTEXT. FOR WHAT IT IS LIKE A COUNTY OFFICE DOES. SO THESE ARE KNOWN PARTNERS THAT CONTINUES TO BE A TEAM APPROACH THAT'S A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO TAKES A LOOK AND HELPS THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IDENTIFY THEIR ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS. IN A SELF KIND OF A SELF DISCOVERY PROCESS IT'S NOT WERE COMING IN AND THE PERSON I THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS SAYING JUST TELL ME WHAT I SUPPOSED TO DO. THAT WAS KIND OF THAT'S KIND OF THE OLD APPROACH NEW APPROACH IS COMING ALONG SIDE. I'M FAMILIAR WITH YOU I'M KNOWN TO YOU YOU'RE KNOWN TO ME LET'S LOOK AT THE DATA TOGETHER AND TOGETHER DECIDE WHERE IT IS YOUR NEEDS ARE AND AND DECIDE TOGETHER HOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD AND WANT TO TRY. TO. AND TO IMPROVE. HOW THINGS ARE GOING? WITH THAT WE GET WHERE WE. INVASION LONG TERM SOLUTIONS VERSUS SHORT TERM. SOLUTIONS SO IT'S LOCAL PRIORITIES LOCAL DECISIONS AND LOCAL TARGETS NOT THINGS THAT ARE DESIGNED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OR THE EVER EVEN THE STATE HERE IN SACRAMENTO BUT COUNTY OFFICES AND APPEAR TO PEER APPROACH. WE ALSO WANT TO DESIGN SOME OTHER SYSTEMS AROUND IT LIKE OUR CALIFORNIA DISTINGUISHED SCHOOLS WE JUST RELEASED. THIS WEEK A LIST OF TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN I BELIEVE THAT THE SCHOOLS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED AS DISTINGUISHED SCHOOLS AND AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY EIGHT I BELIEVE IT IS TWENTY EIGHT EXEMPLARY DISTRICTS. IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE IDENTIFIED DISTRICTS AND THE EXEMPLARY DISTRICTS ARE THOSE THAT HAVE ENGAGED GENUINELY. IN THE SPIRIT OF LCF HAPPEN THE LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN ENGAGING THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND MAKING A DIFFERENCE FIRST THEIR SCHOOL IN THEIR DISTRICT. WE'RE HOPING THAT THOSE DISTINGUISHED SCHOOLS CAN THEN ASSESSED IN A PEER TO PEER PASSION. THAT APPEARED HERE FASHION WITH. OTHER SCHOOLS THAT MAY NEED ASSISTANCE SEPARATELY IN THE AREAS OF THEIR NEED. SO OVERALL I'LL WRAP THIS UP JUST JUST BY SAYING THAT ON. THIS WHAT WE CALL THE CALIFORNIA WAY IS. TRUSTING EDUCATORS THAT KNOWING THAT EDUCATORS WANT TO SUCCEED TRUSTING THOSE EDUCATORS THAT GIVEN THE PROPER. SUPPORTS WILLED WILL. WILL SUCCEED AND THEN PROVIDE THEM THE LOCAL FLEXIBILITY FOR DECISION MAKING IN ORDER TO MAKE THE CHANGES THAT THEY NEED WHILE THEY ENGAGE THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY AND DOING SO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM MARGUERITE REESE FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AS WELL. THAT AFTERNOON I WILL DESCRIBE THE SST PLANNED DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. SO THAT EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACTOR ASSET AS MY COLLEAGUE MISTER I ACTUALLY MENTIONED IS THE REAUTHORIZATION OF THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT OR ESEA WHICH I'M IS THE PRIMARY FEDERAL EDUCATION ON THE BEGAN IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE. AND WAS ONE OF THE FINAL ACTS OF PRESIDENT OBAMA TO REAUTHORIZE IN DECEMBER. TWENTY FIFTEEN IT REPLACES THE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT. ITS PRIMARY FOCUS IS TO AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS AND POPULATIONS AND IT'S MEANT TO SUPPLEMENT NOT SUPPLANT STATE PROGRAMS. AT ALL STATES HAVE TO SUBMIT A STATE PLAN TO THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND I THINK AS MUCH AS CALIFORNIA WISHES WE RECEIVED A BLANK SHEET OF PAPER AND COULD SHARE WHAT OUR PLAN IS WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND WE HAVE A VERY STRICT AND STRUCTURE TEMPLATE TO DESCRIBE AND HOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL BOTH IMPLEMENT THE FEDERAL LAW AND SPENDS THE FEDERAL ALLOCATION. AT THAT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION ENGAGED IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF STAKEHOLDER INPUT I'M THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND FOR PHASES TO DEVELOP THE FIRST DRAFT OF THE STATE PLAN. IN CALIFORNIA THE STATE PLAN APPROVED EXCUSE ME THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION APPROVES THE STATE PLAN IT'S A PROCESS BUT NOT OTHERS MANY OTHER STATESGO THROUGH. AND BUT IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT THERE'S OF THAT EXTRA LAYER OF APPROVAL. AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN CALIFORNIA STATES WERE ALLOWED TO SUBMIT TO IN ONE OF TWO WINDOWS EITHER APRIL OR SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN OF LAST YEAR. FOR SEVERAL REASONS CALIFORNIA CHOSE TO BE A SEPTEMBER SUBMISSION STATE AND SO THE FIRST VERSION OF THE STATE PLAN WAS APPROVED BY THE STATE BOARD IN SEPTEMBER. AND WAS SUBMITTED TO THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION UM WE RECEIVED WORD JUST A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE WINTER HOLIDAY THAT THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAD SOME FEEDBACK FOR S.. ALLSTATE'S RECEIVED SOME DEGREE OF FEEDBACK NO ONE TURNED IN OUR STATE PLAN AND IMMEDIATELY HAD IT APPROVED BY SECRETARY TO BOSS. CALIFORNIA CONSIDERED THAT. FEEDBACK AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BROUGHT FORWARD A REVISED VERSION OR YOU MIGHT CALL IT VERSION TO. TO THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR. IN THE INTERIM. THE ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF MY POSITION IS THAT I GET TO SPEAK REGULARLY WITH MY COUNTERPARTS FROM OTHER STATES OTHER FEDERAL LIAISONS AND WHAT I LEARNED IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND WHAT OTHER STATES WERE ENGAGING IN. IS IN THIS PERIOD BETWEEN SUBMITTING A STATE PLAN. AND GAINING APPROVAL MANY STATES WERE AND BASED ON THE FEEDBACK THEY HAD RECEIVED FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SENDING SORT OF DRAFTS BACK AND FORTH AND ENTERING INTO DISCUSSIONS WITH THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO ESSENTIALLY SAY. WOULD YOU BE OKAY WITH THIS. AN EX CENTER AND SO KNOWING THAT A SMALL TEAM FROM THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. AND THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TRAVELED TO THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. IN FEBRUARY AND. BEGAN THOSE FORMAL NEGOTIATIONS AND THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION STAFF WHAT THAT MET WITH US FOR ABOUT SIX HOURS ON THAT DAY AND CONVERSATIONS CONTINUED. REALLY UP TO THIS DAY BUT I'M CERTAINLY PRIOR TO THE MARCH STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION MEETING. THE BOARD CONSIDERED. CHANGES TO WHAT SORT OF IS THE VERSION TWO OF THE STATE PLAN. MOST OF THE AREAS OF CHANGE ARE FEEDBACK FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WHERE RELATED TO THE ACCOUNTABILITY SECTIONS OF OUR S. A STATE PLAN. SUGGESTED CHANGES RELATED TO AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF SCHOOLS FROM PROVE MEANT OUR ENGLISH LEARNER PROGRESS INDICATOR. HOW WE DISPLAY STATUS AND CHANGE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES? GIVEN THE TIMING OF WHEN THE MATERIALS WERE POSTED IN THE STATE BOARD MEETING IN MARCH THE BOARD. VOTED TO APPROVE A HANDFUL OF TECHNICAL CHANGES AND THE DECISION WAS MADE THAT IN A PROBLEM. THE BOARD WOULD CONSIDER THE REMAINING AND FRANKLY MORE SIGNIFICANT. SECTIONS OF THE REVISIONS TO THE STATE PLAN SO ON APRIL TWELFTH AND THE BOARD WILL TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY VERSION THREE. OF THE STATE PLAN AND THEY WILL. IF ALL GOES ACCORDING TO PLAN. APPROVE THE STATE PLAN AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER CALIFORNIA WILL SUBMIT WHAT WE HOPE IS THE FINAL VERSION. TO DATE THIRTY SEVEN STATES PLUS PORTO RICO EM HAVE HAD THEIR STATE PLANS APPROVED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND AS I MENTIONED THINGS JUST TAKE A LITTLE LONGER IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THE. APPROVAL OF THE STATE BOARD. AS WELL AS WE CHOSE TO BE ONE OF THE SECOND WINDOW OF SUBMISSION STATES IN SEPTEMBER. SO BASED OUR NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THE DEPARTMENT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FEELS VERY CONFIDENT THAT THE VERSION THAT IS IN PRINT THAT WILL BE BEFORE THE BOARD ON APRIL TWELFTH. IS TRULY IN A PROVABLE STATE PLAN WE'VE HAD COUNTLESS HOURS OF CONVERSATIONS AND MEETINGS AND CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND NOW THEY HAVE NOT FORMALLY APPROVED OUR STATE PLAN. WE HAVE WORKED WITH THEM TO DEVELOP THE LANGUAGE AND FEEL THAT WHAT WE ARE BRINGING TO THE BOARD AND WHAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE SENT TO THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. IS AN OF PROVABLE PLAN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM. DAVID SAP DEPUTY POLICY DIRECTOR AND ASSISTANT LEGAL COUNSEL FOR THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND STEPHANIE GRAYSON CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK AND INSTRUCTIONAL RESOURCES DIVISION OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT EDUCATION YOU MAY BOTH. SO I'M GOING TO START BUT GOOD AFTERNOON AND I'M GOING TO KIND OF GO OVER THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM A SUPPORT AND HOW THE LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN. AND OUR MONITORING OF ONLY A SUCCESSES IS INCORPORATED INTO OUR SYSTEM SUPPORT SO IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE EDUCATION OF OUR STUDENTS. CALIFORNIA'S IN THE PROCESS OF CREATING A COORDINATED AND COHERENT STATE STRUCTURE TO INSERT SURE THAT OUR LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES. RECEIVE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT TO MEET IDENTIFIED STUDENT NEEDS INCLUDING THE DISPARITIES AND OUTCOMES OR OPPORTUNITIES AND THAT THIS IS GROUNDED IN A COLLABORATIVE AND. BUILDING CAPACITY APPROACH THE LC FSA FF IS THE FOUNDATION FOR RE EMERGING CALIFORNIA'S ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM AS A RESULT OF THE LC FF CALIFORNIA WORKED WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP TOOLS FOR EDUCATORS. TO USE TO HELP IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS INCLUDING THE LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN AND THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD IN ADDITION TO THOSE TOOLS AND A NEW FUNDING FORMULA. THE LCF I'VE OUTLINED DIVERT VISION FOR SUPPORT ASSISTANCE AND THE SYSTEM IS SUPPORT HAS THREE LEVELS WE'VE LEVEL ONE AND THESE ARE RESOURCES AND SUPPORTS IT EVERY SINGLE SOON ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND TEACHERS HAVE ACCESS TO. WE HAVE LEVEL TO THAT IS DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE IT'S WHERE OUR SUPPORT PROVIDERS COULD BE THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS THAT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION CHARTER AUTHORIZED EARNERS AND THEY CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE PROVIDE DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE. FOR THOSE ELOISE IN SCHOOLS IN THE FORM OF INDIVIDUALLY DESIGNED ASSISTANCE TO ADDRESS IDENTIFIED PERFORMANCE ISSUES AND THEN LEVEL THREE IS THAT INTENSIVE INTERVENTION SUPPORT WHAT THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT FOR PUBLIC INSTRUCTION OR FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS. THE CHARTER AUTHORIZED OR MAY REQUIRE MORE INTENSIVE INTERVENTIONS FOR ELEAZAR OR SCHOOLS WITH PERSISTENT PERFORMANCE ISSUES OVER A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD. THE GOAL FOR THE SUPPORT OF ALL LEVELS IS TO ASSIST ELEAZER IN THEIR SCHOOLS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF EACH STUDENT SERVED WITH A FOCUS ON BUILDING CAPACITY TO SUSTAIN IMPROVEMENT AND EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS INEQUITIES AND SOON OPPORTUNITIES AND OUTCOMES. THIS MEANS THAT THE OUTCOMES FOR THIS WORK INCLUDE NOT ONLY IMPROVEMENT ON DESPERATE INDICATORS FROM YEAR TO YEAR BUT ALSO PROGRESSING ON INTERIM MEASUREMENTS. THE ALLEYS COLLECT LOCALLY AND USE THROUGHOUT THE YEARS THAT THE DASHBOARD CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES TO ELEVATE THEIR LOCAL DATA AND CREATE LOCAL DATA THAT CAN USE. THAT CAN BE USED TO WATER THEIR GOALS ON SPECIFIC OUTCOMES AND MEASURES THROUGHOUT THEIR ENTIRE YEAR SO NOT JUST WAITING FOR ONE ASSESSMENT THEY CAN UC'S THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE YEAR. AND IN ORDER TO IT STACCATO COURTNEY SUPPORTED ALL OF THESE LEVELS THE AGENCIES CHARGED WITH REPORTING PROVIDING THE SUPPORT UNDER THE LCF I HAVE EXPANDED THEIR INITIAL CROSS AGENCY GROUP. TO INCLUDE STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVES AND PRACTITIONERS FROM THE FIELDS AND THIS LARGER TEAM IS THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT PLANNING GROUP AND IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS COMMON CONCERNS AND INTERESTS FROM THE FIELD REGARDING SUPPORT FOR ELOISE IN SCHOOLS. AND THE ELEMENTS OF THE SUPPORT FOR THESE DISTINGUISHING AREAS OF WORK THAT WILL CURRENT THE SYSTEM A SUPPORT INCLUDE THAT RECALLS ANALYSIS THAT CARICATURE BLAMED THAT PATHWAYS TO SUPPORT ASSISTANCE BECAUSE NOT EVERY ALLEY A HAS THE SAME ACCESS. TO SUPPORT AND SO WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE EQUITY OF ACCESS TO THE SUPPORTS THE INITIAL OUTREACH TO ELEAZAR THE REVIEW OF DATA THAT SUPPORTS ALLEYWAYS IN THEIR SCHOOLS TO IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES. AND CALIFORNIA'S APPROACH TO ASSISTANCE UNDER LC FF DIFFERS GREATLY FROM THE PAST AND IS A FORMER PRINCIPAL OF A SCHOOL THAT WAS UNDER LCL BE. ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM I CAN HONESTLY SAY THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH IS ABOUT GETTING IN WITH THE LA AND HELPING THEM DETERMINE WHAT ARE THE ROOT CAUSES WHAT ARE THEIR BARRIERS. TO PROVIDING QUALITY INSTRUCTION TO EVERY SINGLE STUDENT AT THEIR SCHOOL SO THIS IS A VERY EXCITING OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE THE THE THREE OF THESE KEY STEPS REFLECT THAT. THE INTENT THAT DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE TO TAILOR IT TO BE TAYLOR TO LOCALLY IDENTIFIED NEEDS RATHER THAN IMPOSE AS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL. SOLUTION SO THAT SOME OF THESE. SHIPS INCLUDE SUPPORT PROVIDERS WORKING ALONGSIDE ELEAZAR AND THEIR SCHOOLS TO IDENTIFY KEY CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES USING A SYSTEMIC APPROACH SIMILAR TO LOCALLY IDENTIFIED NEEDS AND STRENGTHS BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE DISTRICT IS DIFFERENT. THEIR ISSUES ARE DIFFERENT AND THEIR STRENGTHS ARE DIFFERENT AND ENGAGING WITH THE LOCAL EDUCATORS AND COMMUNITY IS AS PART OF THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS. SO STOP THERE BECAUSE I KNOW YOU PROBABLY HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS BUT IT'S A REALLY EXCITING OPPORTUNITY FOR US AS CD AN ALLEY A SPEEDY ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A SYSTEM. THAT IS GOING TO BE INDIVIDUALIZED FOR EVERY SINGLE SCHOOL. THANK YOU. SAP GOOD AFTERNOON I'M I'D LIKE TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON THREE ISSUES FIRST JUST THE BILL A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT MISTER GREGSON SHARED ABOUT THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT WITHIN THE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. THOSE THREE LEVELS OF ASSISTANCE THAT BUT THAT SHE DESCRIBED THE SUPPORT FOR ALL WEREN'T DEAD. IT DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE AN INTENSIVE INTERVENTION VERY SIMILAR TO THE APPROACH FOR MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT WHICH IS A FRAMEWORK THAT USE FOR DELIVERY OF INSTRUCTION AND SERVICES IN THE CLASSROOM AND SCHOOL LEVEL. SO IT'S A FAMILIAR CONCEPT TO EDUCATORS THAT SORT OF HAS BEEN INCORPORATED AS THE FRAME FOR OVERALL SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. AND ONE THING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT THAT DECISION IS TO NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE SUPPORT FOR ALL WHICH IS THERE'S LEVEL WINDS SUPPORTS. WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE HAPPENS IS THAT YOUR WRITING GENERAL SUPPORT ABOUT HOW TO PROVIDE QUALITY INSTRUCTION TO ENGLISH LEARNERS IT'S NOT TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE'RE COMMUNICATING ABOUT HOW BRIGHT QUALITY INSTRUCTION ON SPECIAL EDUCATION? SO THIS IDEA OF ALIGNING IN COORDINATING SUPPORTS THREE IS INTEGRATED SYSTEM WE BELIEVE IS THE STARTING POINT IS WHAT YOU PROVIDE FOR ALL IN YOU BUILD ON THAT WHEN YOU PROVIDE DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE TO ENSURE THERE'S LESS OF A CONSISTENT APPROACH. AS FAR AS HOW I WERE ASKING LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO SUPPORT STUDENTS. SECOND OR JUST A HIGH WEIGHT ON THE CROSS AGENCY GROUP THAT MISS GREGSON REFERENCED. THAT'S INITIALLY STARTED WITH THE AGENCIES THAT ARE CHARGED BY STATUTE WITH PROVIDING ASSISTANCE INITIATE ITS BEEN EXPANDED TO INCLUDE STAKEHOLDERS. AND WE THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WERE MODELING THE ENGAGEMENT THAT WE EXPECT ELEAZAR HAVE AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS. ENSURING THAT STAKEHOLDERS ARE ENGAGED IN THE PROCESS HELPING TO IDENTIFY AREAS OF NEED IN PLACES THAT THE AGENCIES THEMSELVES CAN FOCUS ON A COORDINATE BETTER ON. AND PROVIDING SUPPORT. AND AS HAS BEEN NOTED THIS APPROACH IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE'VE DONE THE PAST I THINK WHAT I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT IS THAT IN CONTRAST THE PAST OUR CURRENT SYSTEM. INSISTS THAT LOCAL DECISION MAKERS OWN THE CHALLENGES AND TOGETHER WITH THEIR STAKEHOLDERS IDENTIFY UNDERLYING CAUSES FOR LOW STUDENT PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOP SOLUTIONS THAT THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING. IN THE ROLE FOR THE STATE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. IS TO COORDINATE AND PROVIDE ASSISTANCE THAT'S RESPONSIVE TO THIS LIKELY IDENTIFIED NEEDS. THE SECOND POINT I TALK ABOUT IS WHERE WE ARE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LCF HALF TWENTY THIRTEEN WAS WHEN THE LAW WAS PASSED WORKS ARE GETTING INTO THE THAT. THAT YEAR ESSENTIALLY HERE FIVE IMPLEMENTATION. THE TWO TOOLS THAT SORT OF TELL CFF CALLED FOR THE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS THAT THAT LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES MUST ADOPT AND AN UPDATE ANNUALLY AS WELL AS THE EVALUATION RUBRICS WHICH NASH UP IN THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD THAT YOU'VE HEARD DESCRIBED. THOSE WERE ALWAYS INTENDED TO WORK TOGETHER THAT THE DATA IT REFLECTED IN THE DASHBOARD IS USED TO INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN. IT IS THE TASK FORCE ACTUALLY COMPLETES THE LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS THE WAY IT WAS ALWAYS INTENDED WHEN LCF ACT WAS PASSED. BUT THE FALL TWENTY SEVENTEEN DASHBOARD WHICH WAS RELEASED IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS THE FIRST OPERATIONAL RELEASE OF THE DASHBOARD THE FIRST YEAR WHERE THE DEEP WHERE THE GAS WAS RELEASED WITH DATA FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. SO REALLY THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE SYSTEM WITH THOSE TOO STATE KEY STATE TOOLS ARE WORKING IN CONCERT TOGETHER AND WE BELIEVE WILL VERY MUCH STRENGTH AND. THE LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN PARTICULARLY ENHANCE AND MAKE MORE RICH THE DISCUSSIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS BECAUSE THAT DATA PROVIDED REALLY HELP FOCUS WHERE THERE'S LOCAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW TO USE RESOURCES. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS SHOULD BE FOCUSED. AND THE FINAL POINT IS YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU'RE THINKING THIS SOUNDS NICE BUT WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE AND HOW DOES THIS MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR STUDENTS IN CLASSROOMS. I THINK WITH THE WE HAD A LOT OF FOCUS ON WHAT LIES AHEAD WHICH WE OFTEN LOSE SIGHT OF THIS ACTUALLY LIVE TODAY COUNTIES AND DISTRICTS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED AS HER DISTRICTS ARE DEFINED AS NEEDING EXTRA ASSISTANCE. ON THE DASHBOARD OF WORKING WITH COUNTIES AS WE SPEAK SO I'D LIKE TO JUST POINT TO AN EXAMPLE JUST TO ILLUSTRATE THIS DIFFERENT APPROACH THAT YOU'VE HEARD DESCRIBED BEFORE NOW THIS IS AN EXAMPLE. FROM ONE OF THE NETWORKS THAT THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE IS FACILITATING BUT THE APPROACH IS VERY SIMILAR TO HOW COUNTIES ARE WORKING INDIVIDUALLY WITH DISTRICTS IDENTIFIED ON THE DASHBOARD. IN THIS EXAMPLE DISTRICT STAFF HAD COMPLETED A REVIEW OF DAY AT AROUND SIX REALLY TROUBLING SUSPENSION RATES AND WHAT IT UNDERLYING CAUSES. AT THE LAST SESSION THAT COME UP WITH ISSUES THAT ARE PRETTY MUCH OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF THE SCHOOL ITSELF. GENERATIONAL POVERTY GUY GENERATIONAL POVERTY LIMITED PARENT INVOLVEMENT LANGUAGE BARRIERS FOR EXAMPLE. AT THE START OF THE NEXT SESSION THE FACILITATOR RELIGIOUS REFRAIN THE DISCUSSION IS SAID YOU KNOW THAT'S ALL STUFF IT'S OUTSIDE OUR OF YOUR CONTROL LET'S FOCUS ON THINGS THAT SCHOOL TIDBITS THE SCHOOL ITSELF CAN CONTROL. THIS PROMPTED A RECOGNITION THAT THEY WERE FOCUSED ON EXTERNAL FACTORS IN COULD INSTEAD BE FOCUSING ON THINGS THAT THEY THEMSELVES. COULD CONTROL FOR EXAMPLE SCHOOL CULTURE AN APPLICATION OF SUSPENSION POLICIES. THEY SHIFTED THE DISCUSSION FROM THINGS THAT WERE EXTERNAL TO THE SCHOOL TO THINGS THAT THEY DID HAVE CONTROL OVER AND REALLY MOVED INTO A DIFFERENT TYPE OF DISCUSSION. ABOUT HOW THEY COULD USE DATA TO INFORM THEIR OWN DECISION MAKING. THIS IS A REALLY DIFFERENT CONVERSATION FROM WHAT WOULD OCCUR IF SOMEONE SHOULD UP WITH A CLIPBOARD IN THE CHECKLIST AND SAID HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO OUR PROGRAM THAT YOU NEED TO IMPLEMENT AS A SOLUTION. SIMILAR CONVERSATIONS WITH HER ABOUT MINDSET IN CULTURE SHIFT ARE TAKING PLACE ACROSS THE STATE AS WE SPEAK. AND THEY'RE LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR THE REALLY HARD WORK THAT WE HAVE AHEAD OF US IS A STATE OF DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND RESPONSIVE TO STUDENT NEED. AND IN DOING THAT THAT'S HOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE PROGRESS IN NARROWING THE PERFORMANCE GAPS THAT WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLE WITH IS THE STATE STATE FOR DECADES. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND LOOK TOWARDS YOUR QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU ARE VERY WELL DONE ALL THE PANEL MEMBERS ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE PANEL. CENTER MORE LOCKED. IF YOU WISH CHAIR JUST JUST A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS. YOU DON'T PROVIDE POLICE THE MATURE I HAVE A AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT A DASHBOARD LOOKS LIKE. AND SO. THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. OF BECAUSE I AM GETTING. CONCERNED FROM PARENTS WERE SAYING IT'S VERY DIFFICULT. TO WORK THROUGH THAT THE DASHBOARD BUT I I'M JUST CHRIS WHAT IS BEING MEASURED. AND THEN. SINCE I'M WILL ANAL ON ON PAGE. SEVEN OF TWELVE IN YOUR. MONITORING ELLIE OUT ELLIE A OUTCOMES YOU HAVE A GRAPH THAT SAYS AMONG CALIFORNIA DISTRICTS. SIX HUNDRED AND THREE HAD LOW RATINGS FOR MATH OR ENGLISH. THAT'S I'M JUST RUNNING TO MAYBE YOU CAN EXPLAIN THAT PAGE SOMEONE. OR PERHAPS THAT'S IN THE PACKET WE WILL SEE WHAT IS THE PAGE NUMBER. SAYS SEVEN OF TWELVE. IT'S DATED MARCH TWENTY THIRD TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO FIFTY FIVE PM IT'S ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH THE THIRD SEX. IT'S GOT A BAR CHART. WE'RE GETTING A PACKET SO WE CAN SEE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO IT. BACK. THAT'S IT. WE GIVE THEM A PACKET. SINCE ARE YOU HAVE EXCELLENCE. GIVEN THE WEB ALIVE WHAT TABS IT'S IT'S. IT'S RIGHT IN FRONT MONITORING LA A QUESTION. WELCOME TO SCHOOL DASHBOARD TEST SCORE RATINGS. AND SO I BELIEVE WE HAVE ELEVEN HUNDRED SCHOOL DISTRICTS APPROXIMATELY. NO MORE THAN HALF OF THEM ARE. YOU HAD LOW RATINGS FOR MATH OR ENGLISH I JUST MAYBE SOMEONE COULD JUST COMMENT. SO. THIS SO I I THINK I THINK WITH THIS CHART IT COMES FROM A NEWS ARTICLE THAT DID AN ANALYSIS OF THE DASHBOARD DATE I BELIEVE LOOKING AT IT. AND WHAT THIS SHOWS IS ACTUALLY INFORMATION THAT IS REPORTED ON THE DASHBOARD WHICH IS IF ED IF IT DISTRICT OR A SCHOOL OR ANY STUDENT GROUP WITHIN DISTRICT OR SCHOOL. IS PERFORMING LOW ON ANY OF THE INDICATORS THAT DASHBOARD INCLUDES MULTIPLE MEASURES INCLUDING TEST SCORES THE TEST SCORES IS A VERY IMPORTANT INDICATOR. AND ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM BUT IT'S NO LONGER THE ONLY INDICATOR SUCCESS. SO THIS IS ACTUALLY AS PART OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM WORK ANNUALLY REPORTING DATA WE USED TO USING COLORS ARE RED BEING THE LOWEST WORD MARKETING SLIGHTLY BETTER BUT STILL LOW. AND SO THIS IS TILING THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE THAT ARE STRUGGLING ON ASSESSMENTS. AND ONE THING THAT I THINK IS IT IS IMPORTANT GOING BACK TO POINT I MADE ABOUT THE LEVEL ONE THE SUPPORT FOR ALL. THE STATE BOARD REVISE THE A PLAN TEMPLATE FOR THE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS TO EVERY YEAR. DISTRICTS NOW WE HAVE A DASHBOARD HAVE TO LOOK AT THEIR DOUBTS WERE DATA AND IF THERE'S A SINGLE INDICATOR WHERE THEY HAVE A RED OR ORANGE WHICH OF THOSE TWO LOWEST PERFORMANCE LEVELS. THE NEED TO ADDRESS IN THEIR LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO ADDRESS THAT WITH THAT INDICATOR OF LIEU OF LIVE PERFORMANCE. AS FAR AS OUR OVERALL ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM WE'RE LOOKING AT LEAST TWO INDICATORS WHERE DISTRICT TO STRUGGLING AS FAR AS THAT'S WHAT THE STATUTE HEALTHY FF ITSELF IN STATUTE. SAID THAT THE ASSISTANCE FROM COUNTIES WHAT WE'RE CALLING THAT LEVEL TO DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE WE LOOK AT WHETHER A STUDENT GROUP IN A DISTRICT IS STRUGGLING ON AT LEAST TWO MEASURES. SO IF THERE AND READ IT BASICALLY ON TO THESE DASHBOARD MEASURES THAT URBAN I IN MEASURING DIFFERENT THINGS A TEST SCORES AND SUSPENSION RATE OR TEST SCORES IN GRAD RATE. THAT'S WHEN COUNTIES REQUIRED TO COME IN AND OFFER ASSISTANCE BUT EVEN IF THEY DON'T GET COUNTY ASSISTANCE THEIR REQUIRED ANNUALLY THROUGH THEIR LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN PROCESS. ENGAGING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO LOOK AT THAT DATA REFLECT ON IT AND DESCRIBE HOW THEIR ADDRESSING IT IN THEIR OWN LOCAL PLAN. FOR THE NUMBER I CAN ASSUME YOU DIDN'T PUT THIS. BOOK TOGETHER NO CENTER MORE LACK OF HIT APOLOGIZE I ASSUME THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING YOU COLLABORATED ON IT. AND GAVE TO ASIDE I DID MEAN TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT THEN THE COULD COULD YOU EXPLAIN MAYBE THIS GRAPH. A BUSINESS A ONE FOR ONE. AT THAT THERE MAYBE ARE MORE LATINO STUDENTS AT THIS PARTICULAR SCHOOL. SO I. I WOULD WANT TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING DATA. TO TO BE CONFIDENT IN AND ANSWER YOUR QUESTION BUT I I BELIEVE THAT BUT IF YOU IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF A DISTRICT. THAT'S HOW ALL STUDENTS ARE DOING SO THAT IS A WE WE THE DASHBOARD PROVIDES A COLOR FOR ALL STUDENT IT ALSO PROVIDES COLORS JUST FOR INDIVIDUAL STUDENT GROUPS IF THEY HAD AT LEAST THIRTY STUDENTS SO. THAT ASK FOR REPORTS DATA BOTH FOR OVERALL PERFORMANCE IN INDIVIDUAL STUDENT GROUP PERFORMANCE THIS WOULD BE LIKE. ALL SIX HUNDRED DISTRICTS. THAT WERE SAMPLED. NOT SO MYSELF I CAN YOU'RE TIRED AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS BAR CHART CORRECT JACQUELINE YEAH SO UNDERSTOOD JUST TO BE CLEAR AND. WHAT IT SAYS AND AGAIN I HAVE? I DIDN'T DO THIS REPORT BUT WHAT IT SAYS IS IT'S MATH OR. READING ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS SO IT'S NOT BOTH OF ITS ONE OR THE OTHER WE ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT A THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND ANOTHER. THOUSAND OR CLOSE TO CHARTER SCHOOLS CHARTER SCHOOLS GET THEIR OWN DASHBOARD AS WELL IT'S NOT ROLLED UP THEIR DISTRICT THEY GET THEIR OWN. BECAUSE THEY'RE REQUIRED TO DO THEIR OWN LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN. IN THIS THIS REFERS TO NOT OVERALL SCORES BUT WHAT IS THIS THIS IS SAYING IS AB THREE SIX HUNDRED AND THREE. IN THESE THREE HUNDRED SIX HUNDRED THREE DISTRICTS THEY HAD AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE STUDENT GROUPS END UP IN THE RATHER THE ORANGE SO OVERALL THEY MAY BE DOING VERY WELL AND THIS IS THE. THE VERY INTENT OF THE DASHBOARD OVERALL THEY MAY BE DOING VERY WELL BUT IF THEY HAVE A STUDENT INDIVIDUAL STUDENT GROUP VIET ENGLISH LEARNERS SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENT RACE AND ETHNICITY WHATEVER IT IS. THAT'S IN THE RED ORANGE THEY NEED TO ADDRESS THAT IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO SAY WILL OVERALL WERE DOING WELL. SO THIS PARTICULAR CHART POINTS OUT THOSE THAT HAD ONE OR MORE OF ONE OF THOSE STUDENT GROUPS. DONALD WHEN THE RHETORIC BAR THEN THAT HAS ANY COLOR DIFFERENTIATION IS AFRICAN AMERICAN SO WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN. BUT IT WOULD HELP MAYBE HAVE MORE STUDENTS THAT HAVE ISSUES ON THAT PARTICULAR BAR. IT'S SO IT IS SET SO THIS CHART SHOWS THAT CUT THE TWO COLORS IN THE BARS ARE JUST DISTRICTS OVER ALL IN DISTRICTS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED TO RECEIVE ASSISTANCE FROM COUNTIES SO THE LIGHTER COLOR IN THIS IS THERE IS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED TO RECEIVE ASSISTANCE FROM COUNTIES. THANK YOU RICHARD GREAT THANK YOU JUST JUST TREMONT FRYING CLARIFICATION TO A SUB GROUP IS DEFINED AS THIRTY OR MORE AT A SCHOOL OR ADDED IN A DISTRICT. WELL IN EITHER CASE A EITHER. OKAY MORE AND MORE EITHER. YEAH UNDERSTOOD VERY WELL DONE. I THINK SENATOR ALLEN. WHO HAS JOINED US I WANTED TO? YEAH I WANTED TO AND. TWO IS TO TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT YOU KNOW. HOW WE MAKE THE STASHED FOR MORE USER FRIENDLY AND I THINK WE HAVE WHO THE VISIT I DON'T? DISAGREE THAT THE MOVE AWAY FROM A SINGLE. NUMBER THAT. OSTENSIBLY SUMMED UP ALL OF THE PLUSES AND MINUSES MINUSES OF AN INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL OR INDIVIDUAL ENTITY WAS AND. WAS OVERLY SIMPLE SIMPLISTIC I I I I I I I THINK THAT TIME. IT WAS OVERLY SIMPLISTIC BUT. I'M BUT I THINK THAT. BUT AT THE HEART OF SOME OF THE EDUCATION OF THE THE FEDERAL EDUCATION APARTMENTS CONCERNS. WHO WERE? WORDS DID IT THEY DID ULTIMATELY THIS THE DASHBOARD THIS IS JUST IT'S BEEN SO COMPLICATED. THAT IT REALLY GIVES. YOU KNOW LEASES ORIGINALLY PROPOSED EARLY GAVE NO CLEAR IDEA OF HOW WELL A SCHOOL IS FUNCTIONING OVERALL IN AND. I. I THINK WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR PARENTS TO. INTERPRET. OR UNDERSTAND. I'M. SO OUR I I WANNA GET A LITTLE BIT DOWN INTO THAT QUESTION YOU KNOW WILL. WE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US AS POLICYMAKERS AND FOR BOARD MEMBERS IN. OUR FOLKS IN THE VARIOUS LEVELS OF THE. EDUCATIONAL GOVERNMENT'S BUREAUCRACY TO UNDERSTAND AND AND BE ABLE TO TO MONITOR PROGRESS AT SCHOOLS NOW BUT THERE'S ALSO A KIND OF BROADER PUBLIC. ASPECT OF THIS AND AS IT RELATES TO PARENTS AND STUDENTS AND WHAT ARE WE DOING TO TO TRULY MAKE THIS SYSTEM MORE USER FRIENDLY FOR PARENTS WHILE ALSO. RECOGNIZINGTHE COMPLEXITY OF THE WORK. I'D BE GLAD IF THE START YEAH. SO. SO FIRST. EH SOME OF THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THAT THAT THE PARENTS SIR ARE LOOKING FAVORABLY ON THE DASHBOARD. SO IT'S NOT ALL IS CERTAINLY NOT ALL PARENTS AT ME WHEN HE WAS THE REASON WOULD RESEARCH IS. THAT IS ALL WE HEAR IS THAT CRITICISM SITE MAYBE THERE'S GOOD STUFF SO YEAH A AND AND I THINK THAT'S OF IMPORTANT POINT THE ONLY. POLL THAT THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT'S BEEN CONDUCTED ON THIS ISSUE ACTUALLY FOUND THAT A MAJORITY PARENTS THOUGHT THE DASHBOARD PRESENTED INFORMATION AND HELPFUL MANNER. IT WAS NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THEIR AREAS THAT THERE CAN BE IMPROVEMENT BUT A LOT OF THAT INTO IMPRESSIONS ARE INTERPRETATIONS OF THE DASHBOARD OR HOW. DUMB ARE BEING SHAPED BY WHAT INDIVIDUAL ADVOCATE SOMETIMES FEEL OR SORT OF YOU HOW INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE REACT TO IT WHICH ISN'T ALSO REPRESENT HOW OF HOW ALL. SO I I THINK THAT THAT THAT POLL FOUND THAT ACTUALLY A YOU KNOW A MAJORITY OF PARENTS THOUGHT IT THOUGHT IT WAS PRESENTING INFORMATION AND HELPFUL MANNER WHICH DOES NOT SAY CAN'T BE IMPROVED COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU. ON THAT BECAUSE THE QUESTION IS WHETHER SOMEONE COMING TO IT FRESH CAN INTUITIVELY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE INFORMATION IS BECAUSE AS WE'VE I THINK ALL MENTIONED. THIS IS REALLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT PEOPLE ARE USED TO WRITE PAPER USED TO A SINGLE NUMBER SAID IT'S A PART OF IT IS NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO IS GOING TO TAKE AWHILE FOR PEOPLE GET USED TO WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY. SERVE WHAT MULTIPLE MEASURES ARE AND I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT CAN BE DONE IN TERMS THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY UNDER WAY. OF LOOKING AT YOU KNOW. HOW DO YOU THAT THE FOCUS WAS HOW DO YOU GET THE RIGHT INFORMATION IN THE WEBSITE I THINK THIS IS? CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'VEHEARD FROM OTHER STATES THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH SORT OF BIG YOUR DATA SYSTEM REVIEWS AS YOU GOTTA. FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT INFORMATION IS AND THEN ONCE YOU DO THAT YOU REALLY FOCUS ON THAT USER INTERFACE EXPERIENCE. ANSWER THAT QUESTION HOW DO WE IMPROVE THE DESIGN SO THAT SOMEONE COMING THAT THERE'S TOO MANY WORDS ON THE PAGE THAT'S ONE VERY COMMON AREA FEEDBACK. IF YOU NEED TO USE WORDS TO EXPLAIN WHAT YOU'RE SEEING THERE'S THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH GRAPHICS AND OTHERWISE THAT MAKE IT MORE INTUITIVE FOR PEOPLE COMING TO THE WEBSITE. SO I THINK THAT'S THE WORK AHEAD I'M E. AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW THERE'S REPOSE ON GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE DASHBOARD. WE THINK THAT BE VERY HELPFUL TO SUPPORT THIS WORK AND REALLY DO YOU. KNOW USER TESTING DESIGN WORK. AS WE MOVE INTO THIS OUR NEXT PHASE A VERIFYING THE DASHBOARD SACRAMENTO FOR. I'M CAN I GET INTO THIS THIS WHOLE QUESTION OF. AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE FEDERAL TO THE FELLOW GARMENTS ASK US TO. IDENTIFY LOS FROM SCHOOLS. INDIVIDUALLY. BUT FOR OUR CITY COUNTY PURSES WE'VE CHOSEN AND IF I DISTRICT AS A WHOLE. AND I I LOVE IT JUST TO HAVE YOU RIFFLE OF IT ON THE ADVANTAGES OF OUR APPROACH BUT AT THE SAME TIME. POWER RECONCILING THIS REQUEST FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ON THAT QUESTION. SURE SO THAT AS YOU MENTIONED THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA REQUIRES A DEDICATION OF DISTRICTS THE EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACTS REQUIRES THE IDENTIFICATION OF SCHOOLS. AMENT SPECIFICALLY UNDER ASCI IT'S THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE LOWEST PERFORMING FIVE PERCENT OF TITLE ONE SCHOOLS. AND SO. I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT INITIALLY BOTH THE CD AND THE STATE BOARD HAD A DESIRE TO. SOMEHOW MAKE OUR IDENTIFICATION PROCESS UNDER LC FF FIT INTO. WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS REQUIRING UNDER ASSA? AFTER SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THERE. BUT. INTERPRETATION OF START SHOOTING FRANKLY I THINK IT'S FAIR I'M IS THAT NO CALIFORNIA YOU CANNOT IDENTIFY. SCHOOLS EXCUSE ME CANNOT IN HIGH DISTRICTS YOU HAVE TO GIVE US MISLEAD THE LIST OF LOWEST PERFORMING SCHOOLS. AND SO. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A CRITERION BASED. PROCESS FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE SCHOOLS THAT'S ARTICULATED IN THE DRAFT STATE PLANTS OF THE STATE BOARD HAS NOT YET APPROVED. THIS PROCESS ALTHOUGH THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS ESSENTIALLY SIGNED OFF ON IT AND THE IDENTIFICATION WILL ESSENTIALLY BEAM. THAT IF YOU HAVE THE MAJORITY OF YOUR INDICATORS ARE RED. FOR YOUR SCHOOL THEN YOU WILL BE IDENTIFIED AND THAT SORT OF GOES UP FROM THERE WITH ADDITIONAL CRITERIA BUT IF YOU'RE PRIMARILY RED OR WRITE AN ORANGE. THEN YOUR SCHOOL WILL BE IDENTIFIED FOR THEM. ASSISTANCE UNDER. AS YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST ONE SCHOOL IN THE LA A. CAN A CUDGEL BEEN HERE THOUGH I THINK I THINK THE REASON CALIFORNIA HAD THAT APPROACH ALTHOUGH I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM THAT AND IF I LOWEST PERFORMING SCHOOLS. IS THE CAPACITY TO HELP THOSE SCHOOLS SUCCEED HAS TO HAPPEN AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL. BECAUSE UNDER THE OLD NCLB AND I LIVE THIS YOU HAD A CONSULTANT FROM THE OUTSIDE COMING YEAR SCHOOL NOT IN YOUR DISTRICT OFFICE. YEAH THEY WERE THERE FOR THREE YEARS INTO YOU LIFTED YOU KNOW YOUR YOUR SCORES UP AND THEN THEY LEFT AND THE CAPACITY. TO KEEP THAT GOING DID NOT REMAIN AND I THINK THAT THE IDEA HERE IS THAT THIS EXPERTISE HAS TO BE DEVELOPED. BUT THE DISTRICT LEVEL LIMIT DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T IDENTIFY LOW BLOWS FOR SCHOOLS WITH A GREAT QUESTION TO THEM BECAUSE LET ME OUT SO LET ME ASK ABOUT THIS I KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING FROM THE AND THE FOLKS FROM THE CONSORTIUM IN A LITTLE BIT. BY. ONE OF THE INTERESTING CONVERSATIONS RIGHT NOW THAT COMES DOWN TO WHETHER. IT THE EXTENT TO WHICH DISTRICTS GET TO ASK. YOU'LL GET THE BASIC CHOOSE YOU PROVIDE THEM WITH SUPPORT SO I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. AND REQUIRES A SIX OR PER THEIR COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION FOR SUPPORT. BUT WE CREATED THIS SEE SEE TO. ASSIST WITH JUST THOSE KIND OF SITUATIONS I THOUGHT SO WHAT WHERE WE. WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S THE STORY HERE IN TERMS OF FUN WHEN? QUESTION SO I I THINK WE WOULD DEFERRED OF THE THIRD PANEL WHICH IS FOR A. LEGISLATING ALICE OFFICE AND PARTNER FINANCE ON THEIR OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IF THAT'S OKAY JUST BECAUSE I I KNOW THAT THEY HAD THAT DEL WEEK THEY'LL BE COVERING THAT BUT BUT I THINK. GOING BACK TO THE ISSUE OF SCHOOL IDENTIFICATION HOUSE IT FIT WITHIN A DISH AND UP YOU KNOW. LOOKING TROUGH ANY FORMULA FOCUSES ON LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY AS THE LOCUS OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPROVING CLASSROOMS I THINK. TOOK TO THAT POINT THAT'S TRUE BUT THERE'S NOTHING INCONSISTENT WITH THAT ELLIOTT FOCUS TO SAY. DISTRICT YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON SCHOOL IS REALLY STRUGGLING BECAUSE YOU MIGHT NOT BE AT THE MOMENT OR AT LEAST WE'RE GONNA ENSURE THAT IS PART OF THE DISCUSSION IN DEVELOPING YOUR LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN. YOU ARE PAYING ATTENTION IF THE SCHOOL THAT MAYBE YOUR OTHERWISE HIGH FLYING DISTRICT BUT THERE'S A SCHOOL THAT STRUGGLING. I'M SO SO WE BELIEVE I I THINK THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION TO INCORPORATE THESE CHANGES IN THE IN THE FEDERAL PLAN. WITH THE WE DO NOT LEAVE THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY INCONSISTENT WITH LCF AFTER AN ANYWAY BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT DISTRICTS SHOULD BE DOING WE EXPECT DISTRICTS TO BE LOOKING AT THEIR SCHOOL LEVEL DATA. AND RESPONDING APPROPRIATELY WITHIN THE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN PROCESS IT'S A WE THINK THERE'S A WAY TO GO ABOUT ADDRESSING THE SCHOOL IDENTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS UNDER ESTA UNDER THAT APPROACH IN PARTICULAR. BECAUSE ASSN ITSELF GIVES LEAD UP TO THE STATE'S TO REALLY FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE DO THAT SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT PROCESS SO THIS STATE WE CAN CHOOSE TO BAKE IT MAKE IT VERY MUCH A DISTRICT FOCUSED PROCESS I'M. OKAY DO YOU THINK OR THE ANOTHER THING ANOTHER CAME UP IN THE CONTEXT OF THE THE FEDERAL REVIEW. HOW DID YOU WITH THE WAY THEY WERE WAITING VARIOUS THINGS IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN SO AND? IN A. TEST SCORES IN GRADUATION RATES VERSES SUSPENSION RATES IMPAIR ENGAGEMENT. THEY WERE CONCERNED THAT THERE WERE. SOME VERY TANGIBLE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT WEREN'T GIVEN ADEQUATE. WEIGHT. I. WHERE IS THAT CONVERSATION GOING WITH THE FEDS? SURE SO THE US THE STATUTE REQUIRES THAT. THE IN THERE ARE ACADEMIC INDICATORS AND NON ACADEMIC INDICATORS COURSE CALIFORNIA'S PROPOSING TO HUMBLE. UNDER S. A STATUTE ACADEMIC INDICATORS HAVE TO HAVE. THE WORD MUCH GREATER WEIGHT IN THE AGGREGATE THANK YOU. THAN NON ACADEMIC INDICATORS I KNEW HE HAD. AND SO PART OF THE CONVERSATION WITH THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WAS OKAY CALIFORNIA FOR THE INDICATORS THE YOU HAVE THEIR ACADEMIC AND NON ACADEMIC HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF SCHOOLS. THAT I AM A SCHOOL ESSENTIALLY IN THE EXAMPLE OF MAYBE THEY HAVE A REALLY GOOD SUSPENSION RATES OF THEIR A GREEN OR BLUE BUT ALL ROUND ACADEMIC INDICATORS HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT THAT SCHOOL DOESN'T BEASLEY ESCAPE IDENTIFICATION. AND SO THE WAY THAT WE'VE CREATED THE CRITERION FOR IDENTIFICATION OF SCHOOLS DOES NOT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. IT DOESN'T. A HIGH. SO EVEN IF YOU'RE. THE MAJORITY OF INDICATORS ARE RED BUT ON A NON ACADEMIC INDICATOR. LIKE SUSPENSION RIGHT YOU'RE DOING VERY WELL YOU WILL STILL BE IDENTIFIED FOR. ASSISTANCE UNDER ASSA. THE SUIT IF IF OKAY SO EASIER SINCE OKAY SO YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THERE'S A YEAR FEELING CONFIDENT ABOUT. A MECHANISM FOR. ADEQUATE ATTENTION BEING GIVEN TO. REAL TANGIBLE ACADEMIC CHALLENGES. I AM YES. OKAY BLASTING ALASKAN AND MAYBE THIS IS ALL MAY GO. AUTHOR THIS OUT HERE FOR SOME OF THE FUTURE PANELS TO BUT I KNOW THERE SPEND. HER BROAD CONCERNED IN SOME OTHER STATES I'VE HEARD LESS ABOUT HERE BUT WAY YOU KNOW I READ ABOUT SOME OTHER STATES THERE'S BEEN. SERIOUS CLAIMS MADE ABOUT DISTRICTS ENCOURAGING. I LOWEST LOWER ACHIEVING STUDENTS FROM. THEIR FOR STAYING HOME ON TEST DAYS. ESOS TO MAKE DO THE SCHOOLS LOOK GOOD I'M THIS IS BETTER THE REAL SCANDAL AND IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. ARE AS THIS COME UP IN YOUR CONVERSATIONS AND AND. MAYBE SOMETHING OUT I TALKED TO THE. NEXT COUPLE PANEL'S ABOUT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOW AND. BUT BUT BUT IT SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ELIOT OUTCOMES IN THE LOCAL LEVEL AND CAN YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT. ANY WORK TO MAY BE IN THAT SPACE. LIKE I CAN SPEAK TO THE THERE THERE IS A FEDERAL REQUIREMENT. THAT WE THAT WE MEASURE AND GIVE A RATE TO EVERY SCHOOL IN EVERY DISTRICT AS TO THE PARTICIPATION RATE AND AND THE STATEWIDE ASSESSMENTS. OUR PARTICIPATION RATE HAS BEEN VERY HIGH SO THOSE KIND OF ISSUES HAVE NOT. HAVE NOT REALLY COME TO CALIFORNIA WHERE I THINK WHERE OTHERS STATES HAVE EXPERIENCED IT. IS WHERE YOU HAVE A LARGE AMOUNT OF THEM PERHAPS ANTI TESTING OR ANTI COMMON CORE SENTIMENT. AND THEY'VE THEY'VE. ENCOURAGED PARENTAL OUR DOUBTS. FOR THAT AND SO IN SOME CASES PERHAPS INCORRECTLY. OUR PARTICIPATION RATE IS VERY HIGH IN THE STATE AND THERE'S VERY FEW EXAMPLES OF LARGE NUMBERS ABOUT DOUBTS. MCCARRON THANK YOU AND IT'S INTERESTING ARE YOU WEBSITE I'M SO SORRY WHAT WHEN ONE OF THE ON ASK ABOUT HOW TO DO WITH. THE BELLWETHER EDUCATION PARTNERSHIP POURED THAT TALKED ABOUT THE KIND DEEMED S. PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY ON. AND THE CENTERS WERE GIVING SCHOOLS IN THE SENATE TO IMPROVE STUDENT PERFORMANCE. DE DO YOU. WHAT WHAT'S IT WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON THAT ISSUE? I I GUESS I WOULD SAY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTUAL ERRORS IN THEIR ANALYSIS THAT THAT WE END UP RESPONDING TO THEIR TO MAKE CORRECTIONS TO THEIR REPORT BECAUSE THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THEY MISS READ OR. OVERLOOKED CERTAIN PARTS OF INCLUDING THE PLAN SO I I THINK JUST IN TERMS OF. WHETHER THAT IS A. THAT THE QUALITY AND RIGOR OF THEIR INTERVIEW PROCESS THEY WERE WORKING THIS IS YOU KNOW EVERYONE HAS TO TURN THIS AROUND REALLY QUICK BECAUSE OF THE TIME LINES AND REVIEWING PLANS IN THESE ARE HUNDRED TWENTY SOME PAGE DOCUMENTS. SO I THINK WHAT WE WOULD DISAGREE WITH THE CONCLUSIONS FROM A RESEARCH AND LINGER PERSPECTIVE IN MANY RESPECTS. BUT I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY WE DISAGREE WITH THEIR CONCLUSION WHICH IS THEIR VIEW THAT THE ONLY WAY TO TAKE SERIOUSLY SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT IS TO GO BACK TO THE APPROACH TO SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT UNDER NCLB THAT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. AND THAT WAS REALLY THE LANDS AND FRAME THEY WERE BRINGING TO IT WE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE WITH THE STAFF FROM THEM HE WORKED ON IT AND THAT BECAME QUITE CLEAR IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS. SO I THINK THEY JUST HAD US OR PRE PRECONCEIVED NOTION OF WHAT THEY BELIEVE A GOOD PLAN LOOKED LIKE. IN CALIFORNIA'S INNOVATING ARM AS CHAIR TALENTED DISCS THE WERE THERE COUNTRIES WATCHING WHAT CALIFORNIA'S DOING BECAUSE IT IS. A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO IMPROVEMENT. AND I THINK THAT SORT OF OUR OVERALL RESPONSE WOULD BE THAT IF IT'S A. IT'S A LITTLE IRONIC FOR PEOPLE WHO WORK IN I THINK WERE ALRIGHT WE FOCUS. ON THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP IN THE DISPARITIES THAT EXIST. BUT THERE'S HAVE PERSISTED FOR THE LAST TWO DECADES UNDER THE APPROACH THAT BERMAN CRITICIZED FOR NOT GOING BACK TO YOU. SO I THINK WE WOULD PREFER TO YOU KNOW TAKE THE TEN THAT WERE ASKING DISTRICTS AND TEACHERS THAT YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING ISN'T WORKING FOR STUDENTS. TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD I THINK. YOU'D RATHER INCENTIVIZE THEN DEMONIZED. CAN THE DEMONIZING PATH DID NOT WORK WE SAW THAT RIGHT FOR HOW MANY YEARS THAT'S THE QUESTION HOW BUT HOW MUCH ARE WE SENATE RISING EFFECTIVELY. WELL AS I I THINK WE CAN WE CAN LOOK AT THAT AT SOME DATA POINTS THAT SHOW THAT WERE ON THE RIGHT TRACK WE SEEM THERE'S CLEARLY A LOT OF WORK TO DO IF YOU LOOK AT THE ASSESSMENT RESULTS AND I THINK IT WE EVERYONE WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE'S. A LOT OF WORK TO DO THERE TO IMPROVE. YET TO SUPPORT THAT TEACHERS IN CLASSROOMS HOW THEY'RE LIVING INSTRUCTION. BUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN LOOK AT GRADUATION RATES THE HIGHEST IT'S EVER BEEN IT'S ACTUALLY NARROWING GAPS IN GRADUATION RATES HISTORICALLY WE HAVE THE HIGHEST. NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO ARE GRADUATING ELIGIBLE FOR UC AND CSU. SUSPENSION RATE IS GOING DOWN THERE IS A RECENT STUDY RELEASED BY THE LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE THAT SHOW THAT ACTUALLY THE DIFFERENTIAL INVESTMENTS THE FUNDS. TO DISTRICTS UNDER LCF AFTER THE SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION GRANTS YOU ACTUALLY SING GREATER IMPROVEMENT ON MATH SCORES. IN GRADUATION RATES AT DISTRICTS ARE GETTING MORE OF THEIR STUFF ON ON CONCENTRATION DOLLARS SO THERE'S SOME EARLY EVIDENCE IS CERTAINLY NOT CONCLUSIVE. I THINK THAT'S WHY THERE'S A COMMITMENT TO REALLY KEEP AN EYE ON THIS AND LISTEN. TO DISTRICTS STAKEHOLDERS AND OTHERS ABOUT WHAT'S WORKING WHAT ISN'T AND HOW WE CAN IMPROVE IT. BUT TO SORT OF I THINK WE DO HAVE EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT WE ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK IT'S EARLY OTHERS BUT WITH US IN THAT WE CAN BUILD ON. THANK YOU AND JUST JUST TO TRY DIDN'T WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. THAT CHAIR ALAN THAT YOU KNOW IN A STUDENT ISN'T SHOWING TESTING DAY THAT THEY'RE GONNA TAKE THE TEST ANOTHER DAY. IS NOT ONLY GIVEN ONE DAY SO THAT. THERE'S SOME OTHER PLACES WHERE I WAS. I MEAN THAT MAY BE TRUE BUT SO THE STUDENTS SHAUNA MONEY THERE'S TESTING ON MONDAY. SCHOOL GUY CAPTURE THEM AT SOME POINT AND GIVE THEM THE TEST SO IT'S NOT JUST A YOU ARE HERE THAT DAY IT INTO JUST NOT OF PARENTS SIGNED A WAIVER. WHICH IN MY EXPERIENCE. PARENTS WERE SIGNING WAIVERS ARE MORE ENGAGED AND THOSE WHO ARE NOT. THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY THEN THEY WOULDN'T TAKE THE TEST SO THERE'S WAIVERS AND THERE'S JUST MISSING THE TASK OF TWO DIFFERENT THINGS I WOULD SAY. AND THEN ON THE ON ON ON SUBMITTING THE APPLICATION TO THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT'S. THEN IT GOES BEFORE THE BOARD ON THE TWELFTH. AND YOU EXPECT TO BE BLESSED BY THE BOARD AND THEN IT WOULD BE MAILED OFF. TO. US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION PARTNERS EDUCATION. AND. AND DO YOU HAVE A TIME LINE FOR WHEN YOU WOULD HEAR. WHETHER IT SAY DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL TIMELINE WHERE WERE PASSED AT THE TIME THAT THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS TO FORMALLY REVIEW AND ACT ON OUR PLAN BUT. BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I AM I THINK NOT NAIVELY SO BUT OPTIMISTIC THAT OUR PLAN WILL BE APPROVED SHORTLY AFTER WE TURNED IT IN. A MONTH. SIX WEEKS THINK THAT SOMEWHERE IN THE STONE JUST. RIGHT. PROBABLY BEFORE SUMMER FISH. ARE YOU REALLYHOPE THEY COME ABOUT DOCTOR WEBER. SORRY I WAS LATE AND I'M IN. TOO MANY MEETINGS AND PROBABLY AND ONE RIGHT NOW I UNDERSTAND FROM MY STAFF BUT. WANTED ASKS. YOU KNOW THE DASHBOARD IS IS AS POINTED OUT BY. A SENATOR HERE THAT HAS HAS BEEN A REALLY. DIFFICULT THING TO MANAGE IN TERMS OF THE AVERAGE PARENTS I MEAN I I THINK THE DATA. THAT WE GET FROM THE DASHBOARD IS GREAT FOR SCHOOLS BECAUSE SCHOOLS NOT TO DEAL WITH DATA AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING THEY'VE HAD ALL ALONG BUT. BEING ABLE TO EAT BASICALLY PUT IN THE PUBLIC FOR THE PUBLIC TO CONSUME IT HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FIND PEOPLE CONSISTENTLY ASKING ABOUT AND I AND I SOON ASSUME IT'S HIT SOMEWHERE BECAUSE THEY MAKE REFERENCE TO IT IN YOUR REPORT. IS A COMPARATIVE DATA. YOU KNOW OF PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY WANT TO KNOW HOW DOES THIS SCHOOL COMPARED TO ONE ACROSS THE STREET. YOU KNOW THEY MAY NOT BE AS SOPHISTICATED AS AS THOSE WHO HAVE ALL ACCESS TO THIS AND CAN MANIPULATE THINGS THEY WANT TO KNOW. IF I PUT MY KID ON THIS SIDE OF THE STREET WHAT WILL BE THE OUTCOME SOURCES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET. SO. ARE WE PLANNING TO MAKE THAT KIND OF COMPARATIVE DATA. A EASIER TO ACCESS BECAUSE I KNOW YOU SEE IT'S HE IT SOMEWHERE ON WOULD OF FIVE BY FIVE OR SOME KIND OF A. IS THAT TO BE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO IN IN THE IN THE DASHBOARD OF THE PARENTS SEEM TO LIKE EVEN INDICATORS BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH. THE AVERAGE CREATE IS A REAL SIMPLE LIFE THEY WANT TO KNOW WHERE MY SCHOOLS FAN IN COMPARISON TO OTHER SCHOOLS IN THE DISTRICT I MEAN. YEAH. AND MAYBE EVEN WANT TO KNOW NOT JUST HOW DO I COMPARE TO THE SAME SOCIAL ECONOMIC BECAUSE MOST OF THEM WANT TO GET ABOVE A SOCIOECONOMIC. SO THE QUESTION IS ARE WE MAKING IT EASIER TO ACCESS THAT KIND OF INFORMATION ON THE DASHBOARD. AND I APOLOGIZE FOR ANSWERING THAT WAY THAT'S OKAY. FINE I'M SYSTEMS WHERE THIS IS. BACK BUT BUT YES WE ARE ACTUALLY THAT'S ONE OF THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WAS MADE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL FIELD TEST OF THE DASHBOARD. I'M VERSUS THE FALL RELEASE THE DASHBOARD IS THERE'S NOW A REPORT. THAT IS FOR EVERY DISTRICT I'VE ITS OF ITS ON THE MAIN LANDING PAGES ONE. CLERIC TO GO TO BE ABLE TO SEE EVERY SCHOOL IN THE DISTRICT. WHAT COLOR THEY ARE ON ALL THE INDICATORS RIGHT TOGETHER IN ONE PLACE SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE AND COMPARE THAT DATA WE'VE GOT REQUESTS TO DO SOMETHING SIMILAR? AT THE COUNTY LEVEL SO YOU CAN LOOK AT ALL THE EXPECT BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEXT ASH BOARD RELEASED IN THE FALL. SO THAT'S PART OF ALSO OF WHAT WOULD BE A PART OF THAT IS WHETHER THAT LAY OUT THAT IS CURRENTLY IN. WHICH IS MORE LIKE YOU CAN SEE A ROW WITH NO TEST SCORES FOR. ALL THE SCHOOLS THINKING LIKE SORT IT WHETHER THAT APPROACH WORKS IF THERE'S ANOTHER APPROACH THAT WOULD BE EASIER AND MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR FOR PARENTS AND OTHER USERS NOW YOU HAVE TO IDENTIFY THE WHAT THE LOWEST FIVE PERCENT OF WHAT IS IT SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS THAT ALSO ON THE. DASHBOARD. THAT GOAL BLESSED. PENDING THE APPROVAL OF THE BOARD WILL BE GENERATED IN THE FALL OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND SO THAT THE LESS HAS NOT YET BEEN CREATIVELY WOULD BE VISIBLE ON THE DASHBOARD FOR PARENTS TO SAY. YES THAT DECISION HAS NOT YET IS NOT IN THE INFORMATIONAL BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE OKAY. I KNOW WE'VE INCREASED OUR GRADUATION RATE MED DATA IS THERE ALL DO WE HAVE ANY QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS A DISCUSSION OF WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS. AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE I I GET MEETINGS FROM MY COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOLKS STILL TELL ME DESPITE THE HIGH INCREASING GRADUATION RATE. THE THE REMEDIAL DATA THAT IS STILL IN THE SEVENTY EIGHTY PERCENT OF SOME COMMUTING CALLED JUST. SO. IN THEIR MIND SOMETIMES GRADUATION ONLY MEANS YOU'VE. STUFF BUT IT DOESN'T INDICATE ANYTHING QUALITY I HAVE WE DONE ANYTHING THAT MIGHT INDICATE. THAT. THE GRADUATION INCREASING GRADUATION RATE OR THE ACT OF UP. THE ATTAINING OF A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA REALLY TRANSCENDS INTO SOME KIND OF ACADEMIC. ACCOMPLISHMENTS MORE THAN ATTENDANCE ACCOMPLISHMENT. SO I YES. IT AND I THINK THAT CALIFORNIA LED THE WAY NATIONALLY IN THIS REGARD WHICH IS DEVELOPING A COLLEGE CAREER INDICATOR. WHICH WERE ACTUALLY GETTING THE SECOND YEAR OF DATA WILL BE AVAILABLE THIS FALL SO ACTUAL BE ABLE TO PRODUCE A COLOR. ON THE DASHBOARD TO SEE HOW YOU DOING. THIS YEAR COMPARED TO LAST YEAR IN THAT LOOKS AT THINGS YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW IS HE SAID A DIPLOMACY WHICH JUST SHOWS YOU MEMBERS MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. BUT THIS IS LOOKING AT A DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES THAT STUDENTS BASICALLY HAD. THROUGH THEIR HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCE IN IS THE RANGE OF OPPORTUNITIES CAREER BASED AND COLLEGE PREPARATION BASE SO IT'S NOT AN INDIVIDUAL ON SENATE IS AN INDIVIDUAL STUDENT MEASURE. BUT IT'S LOOKING AT AT SCHOOL OR DISTRICT LEVEL WHERE THE RANGE OF PROGRAMS AND RICH OFFERINGS THAT THEY HAVE TO PREPARE STUDENTS FOR SUCCESS WHEN THEY GRADUATE. SO IT'S A IT'S MORE ROBUST MEASURE WE BELIEVE. AND I THINK THERE'S ADDITIONAL DATA THAT'S GONNA BE INCORPORATED INTO IT TO BUILD OUT THE CAREER MEASURES WHICH AT THIS POINT ARE A LITTLE LIMITED. BUT IT IT IT IT GETS NOT NOT AND NOT THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENT LEVEL BUT IN TERMS OF. PROGRAM EVALUATION THINKING ABOUT OF ON THE DISTRICT LEADER. ARE MY HIGH SCHOOL STRUCTURE TO PREPARE STUDENTS FOR SUCCESS TO PURSUE THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY WANT WE BELIEVE THAT THIS INFORMATION IS A REALLY VALUABLE BECAUSE IT'S. LASSEN TO LOOKING ANALYZE. CROSS THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT STUDENTS CAN. DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY'RE READY FOR SUCCESS HOW MANY WHICH ONES ARE STUDENTS AT THIS SCHOOL. DEMONSTRATING COMPARED TO OTHER SCHOOLS AND WHAT TYPES OF OFFERINGS MIGHT WE WANT TO BUILD UP THE SCHOOL TO MAKE THAT UP. THANK YOU THANK YOU TO OUR PANEL DISCUSSION WELL DONE. HELPED A CALL OF OUR NEXT PANEL. WELL LET'S SEE INNOVATION AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL SPEAK DOOM OF FIRST IS THE ROLE OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS BY GREG BLACHE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE THERMAL ITO. UNION ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FORWARD THEN THE ROLE OF COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION THAT MISS JUDY WHITE IS HERE. SUPERINTENDENT OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. ALSO IS THE ROLE OF THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE OF EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE DOT DOCTOR COURT CARL CONE IS SOMEWHERE OUT THERE THERE IS. GOOD GUY. AND. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF IS USING THESE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND THEN CHELSEA SMITH A CONSULT WITH A C. C. E. AND RON WILLIAMS SUPERINTENDENT OF VICTOR VALLEY UNION. HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO START WITH. MISTER BLAKE SUPERINTENDENT BLAKE YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. WELL THANK YOU CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL AND CHAIRMAN ALAN IN THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY MY NAME'S GREG BLACHE AND THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THERMALLY TO UNION ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT. I DO WANT TO MENTION IT WITH ME TODAY OUR TO. TO THE ADVOCATES AND. PEOPLE THAT HELP ME IN OUR DISTRICT FROM BUTTE COUNTY OFFICE OF ED A MICHELLE SANCHEZ AND. GENET SPENCER THERE ARE INVALUABLE TO HELPING US DO OUR DIFFERENT SHOULD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND. LOST ALL OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE DO THE COUNTY OFFICE. WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM. I WAS. TOLD THAT I HAD A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME SO I ACTUALLY WROTE DOWN WHAT I'M GONNA SAY BECAUSE I WANT TO KEEP IT CONCISE. SO I'M JUST GONNA READ IT TO YOU THAT'S OKAY. ALRIGHT. SO. SO I'M HERE TO LET YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THEIR LEGAL UNION ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND WHERE WE HAVE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN THROUGH EIGHTH GRADE. THE STUDENT POPULATION OF ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE TOTAL STUDENTS IS NINETY TWO PERCENT ON DUPLICATED. THE DISTRICT S. BACK DATA INDICATES TWENTY PERCENT MET OR EXCEEDED GRADE LEVEL EXPECTATIONS AND MATH AND TWENTY SIX PERCENT NEIL A AND WEBER PRESCHOOL THREE T. K. THROUGH FIVE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS ONE SIXTH THROUGH EIGHTH GRADE MIDDLE SCHOOL IN A COMMUNITY DAY SCHOOL. SO I'M HERE TO. ALSO TALK ABOUT DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE THE PROCESS AND HOW THAT MODEL WORKS AND YOU COUNTY. SO LET ME BEGIN BY TELLING YOU THAT THE RELATIONSHIP WITH EACH DISTRICT HAS WITH THE BEAT COUNTY OFFICE ABED IS UNIQUE. BUT WE ALL WORK TOGETHER AND MAYBE A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND BICU COUNTY. SO ONE OF SPEAK WITH OTHER SUPERINTENDENTS AROUND CALIFORNIA I'M SURPRISED AT HOW LITTLE THEY KNOW. THE OTHER SUPERINTENDENTS IN THEIR COUNTY. AND HOW LITTLE THEY ACCESS EACH OTHER IS RESOURCES. SO IF I'VE EVER HAVE AN ISSUE OR NEED SOME SUPPORT I KNOW THAT MY FELLOW SUPERINTENDENTS WILL GIVE ME THE GUIDANCE TO WORK IT OUT AND I FEEL FORTUNATE. TO LIVE AND WORK AND YOU COUNTY. THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD IS VALUABLE IN IDENTIFYING AREAS OF NEED OF GROSS OR OR IMPROVEMENT. WHICH HAD A LONG DISCUSSION ABOUT WILL I CONSIDER LONG LONG DISCUSSION ABOUT ON THE DASH WERE JUST MY FEW MINUTES AGO. AND SO FOR INSTANCE ARE CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM DATA FOR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN TO SIXTEEN PERCENT. WHICH IS KINDA HIGH AND THEN ALSO WAS A FOUR PERCENT INCREASE FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR. THIS IS NOT EXPECTED BY TO GIVE US INFORMATION TO CHALLENGE OUR CURRENT THOUGHTS REALLY DIVE IN DEEP. INTO WHY OUR KIDS ARE MISSING SCHOOL AND. ONE OF THE GENTLEMEN HERE EARLIER SAID THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT THE DASCHLE THIS MOST FOR EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS FORCE WE CAN SEE THAT INDICATOR. AND REALIZE WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS PROBLEM IS VERY SPECIFICALLY. SO MANY OF OUR FAMILIES. IN OUR COMMUNITY SUFFER FROM INTERGENERATIONAL. POVERTY AND EXPERIENCE CHRONIC STRESS IN MEETING THEIR DAILY NEEDS. AND SO TO ADDRESS CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM AND SOME OF THE OTHER SOCIAL EMOTIONAL NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS ARE STAFF. IS CAN BE TRAINED BY BCO WE STAB YOU COUNTY OFFICE OF ITS WERE USING COUNTY RESOURCES. THAT'S PART OF A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT AND COLLABORATIVE. A RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE SOUL BE LEARNING ABOUT ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES TRUMP INFORM SCHOOLS TO GAIN AN AWARENESS OF HOW OUR STUDENTS ARE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS FORMS OF TRAUMA. ON THIS LOBBY HAPPENING IN THE FALL. UNFORTUNATELY WE WE ALSO HAVE AN AWARENESS OF UNIQUE KINDS OF TRAUMA AND STRESSORS IN OUR AREA WITH THE RECENT FIRES. THEIR LOSSES OF HOMES AND PETS AND THEN ALSO THE OROVILLE DAM SPILLWAY FAILURE IN THE SUBSEQUENT EVACUATIONS. AND THAT'S ALL HIT OUR KIDS HARDWARE FAMILIES HARD. SO RESEARCH IS CLEAR THAT IF WE GROW THE CAPACITY TO ENGAGE IN CONNECT OUR STAFF WITH OUR STUDENTS THROUGH THESE TRAINING STUDENTS WILL BE LIKE MORE LIKE TO COME TO SCHOOL. IF THEY COME TO SCHOOL WILL BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IF IT WERE SUCCESSFUL THEY'LL FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IN FROM WORK AND COMFORTABLE TO COME TO SCHOOL. SO IT'S A CIRCLE WHO JUST TRYING TO GET THESE KIDS HERE. SOLAR OR ABOUT THE DASHBOARD. MAR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN A DASHBOARD DISPLAY THAT OVERALL E. LA LITERACY PERFORMANCE FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. HAD DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY WAS RED TALK ABOUT THE COLORS SO WE HAD A RED. A RED DOT. FOR TWO YEARS IN A ROW IN THAT SAME STUDENT GROUP HAD SUSPENSION RATES THAT WERE ALSO READ AND THAT'S WHAT PUT. THOSE ARE THE INDICATORS THAT PUT US IN A DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE. SO. WORKING WITH COUNTY OFFICE WE'RE ABLE TO. LOOK AT OUR. OUR SITUATION AND ALSO WE HAD ALREADY IDENTIFIED ARE SUBSTANTIAL IN ANOMALIES WHEN REPORTED IN OUR CAL PASSED OUT IN THE SPRING. AND WE HAD IMPLEMENTED PROCEDURES AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS SCHOOL YEAR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. TO IMPROVE OUR SUSPENSION RATES DISTRICT WIDE. SO OUR STUDENTS HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN PERFORMING. THAT LOW LEVELS ON E. L. EN MASSE STANDARDIZED TESTS FOR YEARS SO. WITH THE SUSPENSION RATES WE ALSO NOTICE THESE THE WE'RE LOOKING AT THOSE RED DOTS WE WE SEE HOW LONG THEY'VE BEEN PERFORMING AT THIS LEVEL AND IT'S JUST. IT'S JUST DROWNED TO SOMETHING WE NEED TO IMPROVE SO IN THE SPRING OF LAST YEAR WE BET BEGAN TO STRATEGIZE HOW WE CAN HELP OUR STUDENTS ACADEMIC POOR PERFORMANCE. WE BEGAN TO WORK A PROFESSIONAL LEARNING COMMUNITIES. SOLUTION TREE CONSULTANTS. AS OUR CAPACITY IN PLC'S GREW WE MADE A DISTRICT COMMITMENT THIS YEAR TO HONOR COLLABORATION TIMING USE AGAIN CONSULTANTS FROM OUR COUNTY OFFICE TO FACILITATE GRADE LEVEL TEAMS. TO REACH. THE OUTCOMES THAT WE DECIDED ARE IMPORTANT FOR OUR STUDENTS. SO DURING THESE GRADE LEVEL COLLABORATIVE MEETINGS WE ALSO DISCUSSED IN FOUNDED EARLY THE NURSERY WAS AN AREA FOR GROWTH AND WEAK CONTRACTED AGAIN WITH OUTSIDE EXPERTS A BUTTE COUNTY PEOPLE. TO FACILITATE STAFF TRAININGS IN EARLY LITERACY IN READING TEACHING STRATEGIES. NUMBER FOCUS. WHAT WITHOUT BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON FOCUS A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE? SO. OUR THE ORIGINAL PLAN WITH YOU COUNTY OFFICE OF THAT WAS TO PROVIDE EACH ELLIE EIGHTEEN THAT OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME FAMILIAR WITH EXISTING DISTRICTS SYSTEMS IS WHAT THE COUNTY WAS DOING. PARTICIPATE IN ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS AND DEVELOP CLEAR PROTOCOLS FOR MOVING FORWARD. SO THIS PROCESS WORKED WELL FOR TO THE FOR. DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE DISTRICTS A BUTTE COUNTY. THEY WERE FAIRLY THOSE. PARTICULAR DISTRICTS WERE FAIRLY NEW ADMINISTRATIVE TEAMS AND THEY BENEFIT FROM. THE SIGNIFICANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION ITSELF EVALUATION. MY DISTRICT THERMAL ITO HAD ALREADY WORKED THROUGH MUCH OF THAT. MUCH OF THE SELF EVALUATION AND ALREADY IMPLEMENTED INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE STUDENT. ACHIEVEMENT ATTENDANCE AND STUDENT CONNECTEDNESS. SO THIS IS THE BEAUTY PART OF HAVING OUR COUNTY OFFICES WORKING WITH THE SO CLOSELY. IN THE SPIRIT OF DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE THE COUNTY OFFICE WAS NIMBLE ENOUGH TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE TO HAVE STRONG INITIATIVES IN PLACE. AND WE NEEDED SOMETIME IN A BIT OF SUPPORT TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR WORK BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE. CONFORMED INTO A ROUND PEG INTO A SQUARE HOLE MINUTE THAT'S THE BEAUTY PART OF THIS DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE. WITH THE COUNTY. THEY UNDERSTOOD. ON THAT WE HAD SOMETHING PROVEN AND WE WERE GONNA HELP OUR STUDENTS. SO THE PROCESS THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH A VIEW COUNTIES NOT PUNITIVE AT ALL. IT'S BECAUSE IT PERHAPS IT'S BECAUSE WE ALL REALLY KNOW EACH OTHER. IT'S THAT SHE'S TRULY THE COUNTY OFFICE WORKING ALONGSIDE US TO IMPROVE STUDENT LOAN OR LEARNING FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. THE COUNTY OFFICE OF IT DOESN'T PROHIBIT US FROM TRYING NEW THINGS TO HELP OUR. HELP OUR STUDENTS BECAUSE ULTIMATELY IN OUR COUNTY THEY'RE ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. SO. FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE AND BEING. A MEDIUM SIZE DISTRICT IN OUR COUNTY OUR LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IS ABOUT IS ABOUT TEN THOUSAND AND OUR SMALLEST DISTRICT I THINK IS IN THE EIGHT RANGE. EIGHT TOTAL STUDENTS IN THE DISTRICT SO. WEEK WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT KIND OF COMMUNITY UP THERE. AND BEFORE I GOT THIS JOB AT IT AT A DISTRICT OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED. I WAS IN A VERY SMALL DISTRICT OF NINETY FIVE EIGHTY EIGHT SO WE HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED KIDS NINETY FIVE EIGHTY AND I WAS A SUPERINTENDENT AND PRINCIPLE. AMONG OTHER THINGS. SO I ASK FOR COUNTY SUPPORT A LOT WHEN I WAS THERE AND THEY THEY WERE ABLE TO GIVE US A LOT OF SUPPORT UP THERE. AND THEY PROVIDED A PROGRAMMATIC ANALYSIS. RIGHT NOW THE COUNTY OFFICES WORKING WITH THAT GROUP. IT THAT THIS. THE PERSON UP THERE THIS YEAR I'M GONNA TELL YOU THIS IS THERE'S ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE KIDS HE SUPERINTENDENT IS PRINCIPLE AND HE TEACHES MATHS FOR EIGHTH GRADE. SO I MEAN HE IS A BUSY GUY ENEMIES OF THE THESE ARE THE SITUATIONS THAT WEWORK WITH UP THERE ON AND IN IMPLEMENTING THESE KINDS OF INITIATIVES I MEAN CAN JUST. BREAK BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT THE. THE PROCESS OF DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE IN THE PROCESS OF THAT WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH I FEEL VERY FORTUNATE THAT. OUR COUNTY IS ABLE TO HELP US INDIVIDUALLY. AND WITH THIS YOU CAN UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE OF BEING A OF WHAT I CONSIDER A MICRO SCHOOL DISTRICT BECAUSE IT'S HARDLY EVEN SMALL. I WANT TO ASK YOU TO CONSIDER A FEW THINGS YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD I KNOW THAT YOU WILL BE HELPING MAKE DECISIONS IN THE FUTURE AND AYE I JUST ASK YOU CAN CONSIDER A FEW THINGS. I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE AN ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY AND MUST TRY TO BALANCE THE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF STAKEHOLDERS OF. A DISTRICT THE SIZE OF LA UNIFIED. WHICH IS ROUGHLY TWO AND A HALF TIMES THE POPULATION OF BUTTE COUNTY THAT A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH SUGGEST LA UNIFIED TWENTY HAVE TIMES ARE HOPE COUNTY. POPULATION THAT BLOWS MY MIND. I CAN HARDLY IMAGINE THE CHOIR OF VOICES THAT SEEM TO YOU ALL THE SAME TIME AND WHAT NOISE THAT MUST SOUND LIKE. BUT ASK YOU CONSIDER REGULATIONS OUR FUTURE CHANGES. ON THAT YOU CONSIDER THE AMOUNT OF STAFF AND RESOURCES THAT THESE MICRODISTILLERIES HAVE. SO GIVE ME A QUICK EXAMPLE I BELIEVE THAT. I BELIEVE THAT ACCOUNTABILITY IS IMPORTANT. WE NOW HAVE THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO ANY SORT CATEGORY OLD COLD NONSENSE. I AGREE THAT WE MUST BE TRANSPARENT WHEN DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE. SO THE SOMETHING LIKE. THAT HERE'S A SUGGESTION RATHER THAN ASK IS SUPER IMPRINTS SUPERINTENDENT PRINCIPLE SLASH TEACHER TO CONSTRUCT A NINETY PAGE EL CAP. WITH THE SAME FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS AS THOSE OF A DISTRICT THAT HAS A TEAM OF PEOPLE TO DO THE SAME THING. PERHAPS IT'S THE COUNTY OFFICES THE GROUP THAT APPROVES THE EL CAP. COULDN'T THEY WORK TOGETHER TO CRAFT A MODIFIED VERSION OF THAT THAT MAKES MORE SENSE TO A SMALL COMMUNITY. AND SOMETHING MAYBE MAKE IT SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY PEOPLE. WILL READ AND USE. I GET CONCERNED WHEN WE PROVIDE A NINETY FIVE PAYS LIKE WE'RE TALKING NOW THE DASH WORKS CONFUSING YOU PUT IT EL CAP IN FRONT OF A PARENT. THEY THIS THEY GLAZE OVER THEY CAN'T THEY DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT SO. I MEAN LET'S I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TINY DISTRICTS AND AND AND EVEN BIG DISTRICTS ARE ONLY TALK ABOUT. THESE KINDS OF THINGS IT'S IMPORTANT TO. ENGAGE. THE COUNTY OFFICES AND A PROVIDING LOCAL CONTROL OF THE TO THE DISTRICTS TO FOCUS ON WHAT THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS ARE. AND I THINK THAT HELPS US. SO MANY CLOSE BY TELLING YOU THAT I'M OPTIMISTIC ABOUT EDUCATION CALIFORNIA AND I'M DELIGHTED ABOUT THE CHANGES THAT MY DISTRICT IS MAKING TO IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES ARE REALLY AND WE'RE WE'RE. KILLING IT RIGHT NOW. I'M EAGER TO GET STARTED ON OUR A MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT OUR MTS ES GRANT THAT WE'RE WRITING RIGHT NOW AND I APPRECIATE THAT. MY PRINCIPLES CAN TAKE PART IN TRAININGS LIKE THE PRINCIPLES LEADING LEADERSHIP NETWORK WHICH IS SPONSORED BY THE C. C. E.. WE DON'T HAVE THOSE KIND OF OPPORTUNITIES A LOT OF THEIR. THESE ARE EXCITING TIMES IN EDUCATION AND I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND WILLINGNESS TO LISTEN TO A GUY THAT'S IN THE TRENCHES. LOVE MY. MY WRITTEN SPEECH THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I APPRECIATE IT REALLY. DO APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. WELL SO THAT'S THE PERSPECTIVE. FROM ME DISTRICT WORKING WITH COUNTIES YES. WHEN I'M HERE PERSPECTIVE FROM COUNTIES. WE'VE GOT YOU A SUPERINTENDENT OF THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. LOVE TO HEAR YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON ALL THIS OKAY FIRST OF ALL AYE SENATOR ALLEN THAT AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AT STAFF I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY. I SERVE AS A RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT. WOULD START ON FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. WE HAVE TWENTY THREE DISTRICTS FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. AND WE HAVE A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH ALL OF OUR SUPERINTENDENTS MEETING WITH THEM ON A REGULAR BASIS. AND DISCUSSING BEST PRACTICES. I WANT TO ON TALK ABOUT MY PERSPECTIVE UNDER THE LENS OF DOCTOR LARRY BESIDES QUOTE. THAT SAYS WE MUST PURSUE LEARNING FOR ALL. NOT BECAUSE IT IS POLITICALLY EXPEDIENT BUT BECAUSE THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS AN EXPENDABLE CHILD. I THINK THAT'S WHAT REALLY DRIVES SAYS TO ALWAYS TRY TO FIND A SYSTEM THAT WILL HELP EACH AND EVERY CHILD. SO TODAY YOU'VE ASKED ME TO PROVIDE MY PERSPECTIVE AS A COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS ON HOW THE STATE'S EVOLVING SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTABILITY. AND SUPPORT IS WORKING. AS YOU KNOW COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT THE. OFFICE OF EDUCATION PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THIS SYSTEM. AND WE TAKE THAT RESPONSIBILITY VERY SERIOUSLY. BUT AS COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT BY BILL THAT I HAVE AN EVEN GREATER RESPONSIBILITY. TO ENSURE THAT ALL RIVERSIDE COUNTY SCHOOLS SERVE THEIR STUDENTS WELL. AND PREPARE THEM FOR EVERY STAGE OF THEIR LIFE. I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM HELPS ARE YOU TO UNDERSTAND THEMSELVES AND OTHERS AND POSITIONS THEM FOR BREAKING THE CYCLES OF POVERTY. AND TO CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETY IN THE MOST POSITIVE WAITS. THIS IS MY FORTY FIRST YEAR IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATION. AND I TRULY BELIEVE THAT EVERY STEP ON MY JOURNEY AS A TEACHER PRINCIPAL LOCAL SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT DURING THAT TIME WHERE. THE LC UP THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED HAS PREPARED ME. FOR THIS RESPONSIBILITY. IT IS STILL THE BEST LENDS UP RESPONSIBILITY THAT I HAVE CONSIDERED YOUR QUESTION. THERE ARE NO SHORT ANSWERS IN THE EDUCATION BUSINESS BUT MY SHORT ANSWER IS THAT THE SYSTEM IS WORKING. BUT REMAINS A WORK IN PROGRESS. WE'VE SEEN SOME ENORMOUS CHANGES IN THE FIVE YEARS SINCE GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED THE ORIGINAL HOUSE YET THEM. LEGISLATION AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE ARE BEGINNING TO SEE PROGRESS IN IMPROVING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. SINCE THE ENACTMENT OF LC UP THAT OUR OUR SEAL  <u><c.green>TEAM HAS</c></u> USE EXISTING STRUCTURES. AND NETWORKS TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING THE NEW SYSTEM. WE MAKE GREAT EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT A CONSISTENT MESSAGE IS HEARD AT ALL LEVELS. SUPERINTENDENTS INSTRUCTIONAL LEADERS FISCAL TEAMS WHO THAT ARE NOT DIRECTORS PRINCIPLES ARE FAMILY ENGAGEMENT AND CHARTER SCHOOLS NETWORKS AND MANY OTHERS. WE'VE WORKED HARD TO BUILD OUR INTERNAL CAPACITY TO UNDERSTAND THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD AND ARE GRATEFUL TO THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS ASSOCIATION TO SUFFER. FOR THEIR VARIETY OF RESOURCES AND PRESENTATION TOOLS. THEY HAVE DEVELOPED FOR COUNTY OFFICES TO ENSURE A CONSISTENT MESSAGE IS HEARD THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO AFTER WE MEET WITH ALL OF THESE GROUPS WE KEEP MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD THE SAME MESSAGE TO EACH GROUP. AT SUPPORT. TO PROVIDE YOU WITH JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF OUR WORK WE HAVE ENGAGE WITH SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SCHOOL SITES THAT. AND POUND LEADERS IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE DASHBOARD. AND HOW THE DASHBOARD CAN'T SUPPORT THEM TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT AREAS WHERE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH. ONE THING WE HAVE TO EMPHASIZE STRONGLY IN ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS. IS THAT THE DASHBOARD DISPLAYS OUTCOMES AND NOT THAT PRACTICES ACTIONS TO SERVICES THAT A DISTRICT IS IMPLEMENTING. I STAFF DISCUSSES WITH OUR SCHOOL LEADERS LOCAL MEASURES AND INDICATED THAT THEY CAN MONITOR FREQUENTLY. TO ENABLE TIMELY ADJUSTMENTS AND OF COURSE CORRECTIONS IN A PROACTIVE MANNER. OUR APPROACH IN THESE EFFORTS IS TO EMPHASIZE REFLECTIVE INQUIRY INTO THEIR DASHBOARD DATA. WE KNOW THAT THE COUNTY OFFICE DOESN'T ALWAYS KNOW ALL THE ANSWERS AND MANY OF THE BEST ACTORS COME FROM OUR DISTRICTS BUT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SUPPORT. THIS TYPE OF REFLECTIVE INQUIRY. I SHARE ALL OF THIS WITH YOU BECAUSE I THINK IT REPRESENTS A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR CURRENT ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. AND WHAT USED TO EXIST NCLB AND OTHER PREVIOUS STRUCTURES. BEFORE SOMEONE FROM THE COUNTY PAPPAS MIGHT GO INTO A DISPUTE WITH THE BINDER OF STRATEGIES THAT THE DISTRICT LEADERS HAD TO CHOOSE BROWN. WITH NO GUARANTEE THAT THOSE STRATEGIES WOULD MOVE THE BALL FORWARD ON STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. NOW WE ENTER INTO THE CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR DISTRICT COLLEAGUES AS THOUGHT PARTNERS. AND EXAMINE THE DASHBOARD DATA TOGETHER IN SEARCH OF ROOT CAUSES. SO WE WERE DIRECTED TO BEAT UP TO MAKE SURE WE IN THAT WITH. ALL OF THE SUPERINTENDENTS. WHO FELLOW TO DIFFERENTIATE ASSISTANCE PROJECT TO THE WINTER BREAK AND THEN WE HAD SUBSEQUENT MEETINGS WHERE OUR TEAM WENT OUT AND MET WITH THE? AYE IDENTIFY PEOPLE THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT TO BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN AND LOOK AT THE LOG DATA NOW THIS IS THE THIRD LEVEL WHERE WHERE THERE. ARE SITTING DOWN AND DECIDING ON WHAT WAS GOING TO BE THE APPROACH SO IT'S BEEN VERY ACTIVE AS BEEN ONGOING. ONE GOING. WE USE DATA ASSN INC RETOOL THAT THESE TO DEEPER INVESTIGATIONS SUGGEST QUESTIONS RELATED TO OUTCOME GAPS IN VARIATION OF STUDENT PERFORMANCE BETWEEN SITES. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE ARE DISCUSSING OUR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WE KNOW THAT THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES ARE NOT CAUSING THE PROBLEM BUT RATHER THAT THERE ARE SIX ESTIMATE ISSUES AND HOW THE STUDENTS. ARE BEING SERVED TO RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE IN THE CONVERSATION. BOTH FROM THE COUNTY OFFICE AND THE DISTRICT FROM THE EDUCATIONAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT FROM THE STUDENT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES DEPARTMENT. WHICH FOCUSES ON STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND IN ALL LIKELIHOOD SOMEONE FROM THE SOUTHPAW. ONLY THEN CAN WE INSURE THAT THERE IS A CLARITY OF PURPOSE AND A COMMON GOAL SO AS A COUNTY OFFICE WHAT WE CHOSE TO DO IS NOT ONLY JUST LOOK AT THE AGGREGATE. OF STUDENTS WITH ON. WITHOUT SPECIAL NEEDS WE LOOKED AT THEIR DISABILITY SO WE ACTUALLY WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. HOW THEY WERE DOING BY EACH INDIVIDUAL DISABILITY HOW WELL ARE YOUR STUDENTS WITH AUTISM DOING HOW WELL I THE STUDENT WITH? OUR EMOTIONAL DID OUR. NEEDS DOING AND THEY WERE ABLE TO COMPARE DISTRICT WIDE COUNTY WIDE AND THEN SHARE SOME BEST PRACTICES BETWEEN. THE DIFFERENT PART DISTRICTS SO WE WE ARE MODELING THE CLAP THEIR APPROACH AS. AT OUR SEAL  <u><c.green>COMPLAINING OF</c></u> FREQUENT MEETINGS ACROSS DIVISIONS IN ORDER TO DISCUSS HOW WE CAN PROVIDE A LINE SUPPORT. BASED ON DISTRICT NEEDS. I'D ALSO LIKE TO SPEND SOME TIME TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE CALL LEVEL TWO DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE WHICH. COUNTIES ARE NAPA BITING AS PART OF THEIR STATUTORY ROLE UNDER LCF AT. AND AGAIN WE ARE GRATEFUL TO SO FACT FOR WORKING WITH ALL THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. TO ENSURE A COMMON APPROACH TO PROVIDING THIS ASSISTANCE. AS BACKGROUND WE HAVE PROVIDED YOU WITH THREE DOCUMENTS YOU HAVE THREE ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED FOR YOU. FROM OUGHT TO SHOW YOU HOW ARE CO YOU HAS ORGANIZED ITSELF TO DO THIS WORK. WE CANNOT LEAVE IT TO CHANCE WHAT WE MUST DO HAS TO BE DELIBERATE AND HAS TO BE INTENTIONAL. SO THE DOCUMENT WILL ILLUSTRATE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LEVEL ONE ASSISTANCE AND ADDITIONAL WORK WE ARE NOW ENGAGED IN AS PART OF LEVEL TWO ASSISTANTS. THE THIRD DOCUMENT IS A FLOW CHART THAT ILLUSTRATES EACH STEP IN THE PROCESS OF LEVEL TWO ASSISTANCE. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF POINTS ABOUT THESE DOCUMENTS I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ONE WE HAVE BEEN VERY MINDFUL ABOUT ORGANIZING OUR DIVISIONS IN THE COUNTY OFFICE. THAT HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR EDUCATIONAL SERVICES MEMBER SERVICES PUT STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IN A WAY THAT CONTINUALLY COMMUNICATES HOW WE CAN BE. OF SERVICE TO RIVERSIDE COUNTY DISTRICTS WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT EDUCATORS UNDERSTAND HOW. ALL THE PIECES OF THIS PUZZLE THE DAX POURED THE AL CAPP THE ANNUAL PDATE AND DISTRICT BUDGETS ALL FIT TOGETHER. SECOND FOR THE DISTRICTS ELIGIBLE FOR LEVEL TWO DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE WORD TAKE IT WE ARE TAKING OUR SUPPORT TO AN ENTIRELY NEW LEVEL. AND AS I TALK TO YOU ABOUT YOU TO YOUR READY ABOUT JUST AGGREGATING THE DATA. IN LEVEL TWO SUPPORT WE ALSO INVESTIGATE WHETHER DISTRICTS ARE PARTICIPATING IN OTHER INITIATIVE AND THAT WORKS TO IMPROVE STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. SUBJECT DEVELOPING MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT OR PARTICIPATING IN THE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING NETWORK SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE. WE ALSO TRY TO LINE UP SUPPORT WITH OTHER SPECIFIC ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE ANA PERFORMANCE INDICATORS INDICATOR REVIEW REQUIRED BY THE A. FOR OUR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. I THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE A NUMBER OF RECURRING THEMES AND ALL THIS WORK. COLLABORATION. ALIGNMENT. BREAKING DOWN SILOS AND LASTLY CLARITY OF PURPOSE MAKING SURE THAT THE RIGHT PEOPLE ARE ON THE SAME PAGE WITH RESPECT TO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND WHEN THOSE TASK NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED. TO SUMMARIZE THERE IS A LOT GOING ON AND THERE ARE A LOT OF MOVING PARTS IN THE PROCESS. AND EVEN THOUGH WE ARE BLESSED IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY TO BE ABLE TO DEVOTE A LEVEL OF RESOURCE TO TO THIS WORK THAT I THINK COUNTIES MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MATCH BECAUSE EACH COUNTIES. UNIQUE FUNDING POSITION. CAPACITY IS AN ISSUE WE HAVE TO CONSIDER. THAT ARE STILL E. WE ARE ALREADY AT THE POINT IN HAVING TO. TRIAGE OUR EFFORTS AND MAKE SOME VERY DIFFICULT CHOICES AND DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE TO FOCUS THE WORK. UNFORTUNATELY. WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT WHEN IT OCCURS THERE ARE STUDENTS WHO. THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN MAYBE AT THE RISK FOR NOT. RECEIVING THE LEVEL OF SUPPORT THEY NEED TO IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL. IN CONCLUSION WE HAVE A WAY TO GO BEFORE WE GET DECLARE SIXPACK. BUT I TRULY BELIEVE THAT WE ARE ALL ON THE RIGHT TRACK. ONE OF THE. CURSES OF EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN THAT WE TO OPT IN CHANGE HORSES IN MIDSTREAM AD DOT WELL MEANING STRATEGIES AND WHAT I'LL CALL. COURSE CORRECTIONS WHICH IN FACT END UP TAKING US FURTHER AWAY FROM OUR INTENDED DESTINATION. MY OWN PERSONAL GOAL FOR RIVERSIDE COUNTY IS THAT WE ACHIEVE IN NINETY FIVE PERCENT COUNTY GRADUATION RATE BY TWENTY TWENTY AND THAT ALL OF THOSE STUDENTS GRADUATE FULLY PREPARED TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND THE NEXT STEP OF THEIR LIVES WITH THE SKILLS TO BE THOUGHTFUL CARING HUMAN BEINGS I DID I DO BELIEVE THAT THE SYSTEM WE NOW HAVE IN PLACE. IS THE BEST VEHICLE TO GET US THERE. THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU. I KNOW HERE FROM OUR DOCTOR CARL CONE IS A CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE TEAM THANK YOU VERY. THANK YOU ARM. THE COLLABORATIVE. WE WEAR THESE LITTLE WRISTBANDS AT SAY CC WHICH ACKNOWLEDGES WHAT YOU ALL HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. THAT THEIR WAS OUT THERE THE WRONG KIND OF HEALTH PROBABLY FOR A DECADE AND A HALF. WE SEE OURSELVES AS THE HOLDERS OF THE ONE TRUE RELIGION. OF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND BUILDING CAPACITY IN ORDER TO GET BETTER AS A COHEN I WOULD EXPECT THAT. I. HAVE MY WITH OR I WOULD JUST REMIND EVERYONE. THAT. BEFORE. THERE WAS AN API AND BEFORE THERE WAS A DASHBOARD. THERE WERE SOME DISTRICTS THAT WERE ACTUALLY GETTING BETTER. AND I SERVED AS SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. AND ONE OF THOSE DISTRICTS AND WE GOT BETTER BECAUSE WE OWNED THE ACCOUNTABILITY PROCESS. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WE DIDN'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME LOOKING AT. STATE AND FEDERAL INDICATORS WE SAID HAVE LONG BEACH IS GOING GET BETTER. THEN WE BETTER ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND WE BETTER OWN THE ACCOUNTABILITY PROCESS AND I WOULD ARGUE. WE SHOULDN'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME. DEBATING DASHBOARD VERSES EIGHT PI THE MESSAGE THAT WE'RE TAKING OUT THERE IS THAT YOU GET BETTER BY YOU HAVE THE KIDS YOU GET BETTER. BY USING THE DATA TO IDENTIFY WHO ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS. IN YOUR DISTRACT WHAT IS THE DATA TELL YOU. ABOUT THAT AND WHAT KINDS OF SUPPORTS DO YOU NEED TO PUT IN PLACE IN ORDER FOR THOSE YOUNGSTERS TO BE BETTER SERVED. WE HAVE ELEVEN PILOT PARTNERSHIPS WE HAVE FIFTY SIX PROFESSIONAL LEARNING NETWORKS THOSE. P. OUTLANDS ARE REACHING THREE HUNDRED DISTRICTS APPRECIATE SUPERINTENDENT BLAKE'S. REMARKS ABOUT. ON RPL LAN. IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK AT WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING. ON THE GROUND WHAT DOES THIS LOOK LIKE TO A REAL DISTRICT IN REAL TIME AND SO WITH US TODAY. SUPERINTENDENT RON WILLIAMS OF THE VICTOR VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT AND OUR CONSULTANT CHELSEA KANG THEY'RE THE TEAM THAT CAN TALK ABOUT. WHAT CC IN A REAL DISTRICT. BIRCH. A GOOD AFTERNOON OF MONEY IN THE STOCK TWO ONE WILLIAMS TYING SUPERINTENDENT FOR THE BALLOT UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IT'S BEEN MY PLEASURE TO BE A PART OF THIS PILOT THROUGH THING. INCEPTION OBVIOUSLY ARE COUNTY OFFICE WITH A PART OF THIS PROCESS. BUT I'LL TELL YOU JUST WORKING WITH CHELSEA IN FACT ONE OF THE STORIES THAT I ONCE SAID TO HER IF I WAS ASKING IF SHE WAS. IF SHE WAS ON OUR PAYROLL BECAUSE SHE WAS IN OUR DISTRICT FELT OFTEN PROVIDING THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT THAT I THINK IT WAS INSTRUMENTAL. IN OUR SUCCESS. WE'RE VERY UNIQUE DISTRICT WE HAVE. ONE OF OUR SCHOOLS IS THE HIGHEST PERFORMING HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTY AND WE HAVE OTHER SCHOOLS THAT ARE HALF AN ACADEMIC CHALLENGES AND I THINK THAT'S A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO WHY. WE'RE GETTING THAT DIFFERENTIATE ASSISTANT. THROUGH THE COUNTY SUPPORT WE'RE VERY VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE AN EXCELLENT COUNTY OFFICE OF SUPERINTENDENT. DIVISION THAT'S WORKING WITH US BUT I'LL TELL YOU FROM BEING A PART OF THIS PILOT FROM THE BEGINNING. THE SUPPORT THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED TO US BY C. C. E. E.. HAS BEEN SECOND TO NONE NOW I CAN'T SAY THAT THERE'S A CHELSEA IN EVERY COUNTY. OF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT I CAN'T SPEAK FOR OUR THAT OUR DISTRICT IN PARTICULAR. CHIEF THE FIXTURE. WITH OUR TEACHERS. OUR ADMINISTRATORS ARE SCHOOL BOARD EXAGGERATE IT MAKES A BIG BIG DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU HAVE THAT ON THE GROUND SUPPORT THAT EXPERT TEETH THAT I THINK THAT YOU CAN ONLY GET BY TAKING WHAT. EACH ONE OF OUR DISTRICTS ARE DIFFERENT WOULD HAVE UNIQUE NEEDS IN OUR PARTICULAR CASE I KNOW THAT CC  <u><c.green>HAS COME IN</c></u> WORK WITH US I THOUGHT PARTNERS. TO LOOK AT THE. THREE AREAS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IF OUR SUSPENSION WAIT. SPECIAL LATEST ENCROACHING ON MOST SIGNIFICANTLY OUR GRADUATION THIS WELL AS OUR MATH SCORES IF THE AREAS THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON IN A CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PROCESS. WE'VE TAKEN OUR STRATEGIC PLAN ARE AL CAPP IN OUR SINGLES PLAYERS FOR STUDENTS EXCEPT IN A LINE ALL OF THOSE. UTILIZING NUMBER OF STRATEGIES THAT HAS BEEN SHARED WITH THAT FORM OF. I THINK THE E. SO I'M GONNA LET HER SAY IF. MAKE A FEW POINTS AND THEY WILL ADDRESS QUESTIONS SUCH MAY HAVE. TOM IT'S BEEN A JOURNEY AND OUT RUNS GIVING ME WAY TOO MUCH CREDIT. YES I'M THERE BUT AT ITS RON AND HIS TEAM AND ITS PRINCIPALS AND TEACHERS THAT ARE DOING THE WORK. SO I NEED TO GIVE THEM HUGE CREDIT AND RON ESPECIALLY. WE STARTED OFF THE JOURNEY WITH SEE SEE WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THE SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE THAT CC PROVIDES. IS THAT WE HAD NOT ONLY BILL CAPACITY. AMONGST OUR LEADERS AND WE STARTED THIS PATH OF HAVING FIVE TWO DAY SUMMIT PER SCHOOL YEAR. AT THE BEGINNING OUR SUPERINTENDENTS THE LEADS OF THE DISTRICT WERE INVITED. AND THAT'S IN ORDER TO BUILD CAPACITY AND TO ASSIST IN WHICHEVER WAY THEY. WITH LIKE FOR US TO ASSIST. AND THEN THAT WE HAD LIKE A PIVOTAL TURN I BELIEVE IN OCTOBER SUMMIT. WHERE WE REALLY DIVE INTO THE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PROCESS AND WE LOOKED OUT ALL DIFFERENT MODELS AND WE ALLOW? OUR PILOT DISTRICTS YOU CHOOSE THE MODEL AND AT THAT SUMMIT THE MOST KEY IN PORN I BELIEVE. ASPECT WAS THAT IT WASN'T JUST THE SUPERINTENDENT THAT WAS FAIR IT WITH THIS TEAM. SO HE BROUGHT IN HIS ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT DIRECTOR WHO OVERSEES EL CAP HIS PRINCIPAL AND HIS ART TEACHER. AS WELL AS E. L. BECAUSE WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT E. L. FOCUS. SO IT WAS A COLLABORATIVE GROUP A OF VICTOR VALLEY OF LEADERS COMING TOGETHER. TO WORK ON VICTOR VALLEY SAY WASN'T US THE SUPERINTENDENT ALONG WHICH MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE AND THEN AT THAT SETTING. DATE DECIDED ON OKAY WE'RE GONNA STICK TO THE PLAN TO STUDY AT. IMPROVEMENT MODEL AND FROM THERE OF THE PRINCIPLE FROM ATALANTA HIGH SCHOOL SHE DID A FABULOUS JOB AFTERWARDS COMING BACK. TO OF THE DISTRICT AND SHARING. WHAT WE'VE JUST LEARNED SEC'S SUMMIT TO THE PRINCIPLES? AND THEN OF RONALD SO THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT THIS ALSO CONTINUE OUR. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT TEAM WORK AND NEEDS MORE THAN JUST AT THE SUMMIT. SO THEN WE MET UP. AFTER THAT I BELIEVE TWICE AND EXPAND THAT THE GROUP TO EVEN MORE AND YOU MAY ASK WELL WHY WOULD YOU EVEN CONSIDER EXPANDING AND IT'S BECAUSE. JUANITA HAVE MORE IMPACTS AND EFFECTS AND A ONE OF THE STORY IS TOM. A THE TEACHER FROM ADELANTO HIGH SCHOOL THAT WAS PART THAT'S PART OF OUR SUMMIT A TERRY BLACK SHE TEACHES SPECIAL EDUCATION AND SHE'S THE DEPARTMENT CHAIR. AND SO WITH OUR CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT MODEL SHE WAS VERY EXCITED. ON AND SAID THAT I'M GOING TO TAKE IT BACK. TWO I ALL MY DEPARTMENT AND GO THROUGH THE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT MODEL WITH MY DEPARTMENT AND SEE WHAT WE COME UP WITH. SO OUR FOCUS AND OUR AND I'VE TO SHARE WITH YOU THE FOCUS WAS A JOURNEY IN A SELF. BECAUSE LAST YEAR THE BIG BOMB GLARING. FOCUS WAS ON MATH BECAUSE THE SCORES WERE SOLO. AND THEN WE SHIFTED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR INTO INCLUDING E. L.. AND THEN AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE FALL THE DECEMBER DASH BOARD OKAY YOU KNOW WHAT THE SUSPENSION RATING GRADUATION INCLUDED. IT WITHIN THE SUBGROUPS. SO THEN IT EXPANDED BUT THEN ALONG WITH THAT EXPANSION ON IT WAS GREAT TIMING IN THAT. THE YEARS STRATEGIC PLANNING. A WHOLE DIFFERENT GROUPS OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS INCLUDED. MET UP AND ALSO REVIEWED DATA AND LOOKED AT THE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT MODEL AND THE DISTRICT'S FOCUS. AND THEN THE SINGLE PLAN FOR STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT SO IT ALL CAME TOGETHER. AND I LOVE THE FACT THAT THE TEACHER IS TAKING A BACK AND SAYING THIS IS AN IMPROVEMENT MODEL THAT I COULD USE WITH MY TEACHERS AT MY SIDE. AND WORK ON IMPROVEMENT WITH OUR STUDENTS SO THAT WAS EXCITING. GREAT THANK YOU. WITHOUT ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE PANEL I HAVE ONE. WITH REGARD TO. THE LOCAL DISTRICTS WHAT WHAT ROLE DOES THE. THE SCHOOL BOARD PLAY. WELL OUR SCHOOL BOARD IS A PART OF OUR STRATEGIC PLAN AS WELL AS OUR EL CAP AND AS AT AND THE SCHOOL BOARD WE UPDATE THEM IN REGARDS TO I MEAN. C. C. E. E. HAS COME AND PRESENT TO OUR SCHOOL BOARDS ARE SCHOOL BOY IT'S A VERY VERY AWARE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING STRATEGICALLY. AS WE'RE DEVELOPING AS WE'RE EXPANDING THAT CONTINUES AND CALL PROVE BUT POT PROCESS IN THEY HAVE INPUT IN THAT PROCESS AS WELL WE HAVE SOME OF OUR BOARD MEMBERS TO COME TO EL CAP MEETING THINK THAT YOU'RE. AND THEN AS FAR AS I CLOUT INSIDE THE CLASSROOM. HOW IN THE WEEDS YOU GET? I WOULD YOU GO TO THE CLASSROOM SEE SEE WOULD YOU GO TO THE CLASSROOM A BUCKET. OF THE TYPES OF INSTRUCTION THAT ARE GOING ON AND MAYBE SAY HEY YOU KNOW MAYBE WE OUGHT TO BE YOU KNOW. DURING THIS TIME OF THE DAY WE HAD BEEN DOING MORE DIRECT INSTRUCTION. MAYBE DURING THIS TIME OF DAY WE NOT ONLY ANOTHER METHOD CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH WHAT DO WE TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD INSIDE THE CLASSROOM. WHERE MIGHT THAT CHANGE ME WHAT MIGHT YOU SEE? THROUGH YOUR EXPERIENCE. I THINK WHEN AND HOW. A. THE THREE OF US HAVE WALKED DOWN CLASSROOMS TOGETHER. BUT I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU WE DON'T GO INTO CLASS WITH AN EVALUATIVE LANDS WE GO INTO THE CLASSROOM OF REALLY LEARNING WHERE THEY ARE AT RIGHT NOW AND THEN FROM THERE. WILL COULD HELP. AND IF THERE'S A NEED. SO TO GIVE YOU LIKE A. HIGHLIGHT OF A HUGE SPOTLIGHT ON A WE VISIT A I BELIEVE IT WAS LIKE THREE. WAS IT THREE OR FOUR SCHOOLS BEFORE THE BOARD PRESENTATION. AND. FROM THAT A IT WAS SHARED WITH US THAT WE SHOULD REALLY GO AND VISIT A ANOTHER HIGH SCHOOL VICTOR VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL IT WAS ONE OF THE VISITATIONS THAT WE DIDN'T DO. THAT THEY HAD REALLY PROGRESSED WELL AND THEIR CT KARL AND MYSELF ALONE MADE ANOTHER VISIT OUT THE VICTOR VALLEY AND IT WAS JUST A WONDERFUL VISIT. VICTOR VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL JUST TO SHARE WITH YOU DEEP. C. T. PATHWAY GRANT HAS ALLOWED THE DISTRICT TO REALLY BRING ON. CAREER OF A REALITY TO OUR STUDENTS WHERE IN TALKING TO THE STUDENTS AND TO THE TEACHERS. THAT ARE TEACHING THE PROGRAMS. VICTOR VALLEY STUDENTS ONCE THEY COMPLETE THEIR CAPSTONE. AND COMPLETE THEIR PATHWAY THEY'RE ABLE TO FIND JOBS RIGHT AWAY BEFOREGETTING ANY FURTHER. EDUCATION AT ALL. ON NOT THAT THEY WOULD STOP IN THEIR EDUCATION PROGRESS BUT THAT'S ONE OF THEIR OPTIONS THAT THE NOW HALF WHICH IS HUGE. AND I THINK MAYBE CARL YOU WANT TO SHARE WITH A ABOUT THE CULINARY. SURE YEAH YEAH I AM EVERY NOW AND THEN YOU KNOW YOU READ. DAN WALTERS COLUMN THAT TALKS ABOUT HOW. MOCHA ADS BEEN TOTALLY ABANDONED IN THE STATE THAT KIND OF THING. A KIND OF A A MEDIA DRIVEN KIND OF THING THE MAZING. CULINARY ARTS. GRAPHIC CARDS COMPUTER CODING. THE CULINARY ARTS. KIDS HAVE A PARTNERSHIP. WITH THE. THE LOCAL HOMELESS SHELTER THERE PROVIDING MEALS THEY FEED. TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FAMILIES AT THANKSGIVING IN ADDITION TO OUR INDUSTRY STANDARDS WHERE THEY HAVE STATE OF THE ART PA EQUIPMENT THAT SORT OF THING IT'S VERY VERY IMPRESSIVE. AN OVERALL COMMENT. CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL. WITH REGARD TO CLASSROOMS THIS-ISN'T SPECIFIC TO VICTOR VALLEY. ONE OF THE THINGS AS WE MOVE AROUND THE STATE THAT WE SEE A LOT OF. IS. IT'S ALMOST THE NOTION THAT. PUTTING. A DEVICE IN FRONT OF EVERY YOUNGSTER IS GOOD ENOUGH. AND AND I THINK WE NEED TO DO MORE IN TERMS OF THEIR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. THE TYPE OF TEACHER TRAINING RETRAINING THAT NEEDS TO GO ALONG WITH THAT IT'S NOT JUST PUTTING A DEVICE IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH KID. AND NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO THE IMPORTANT QUALITIES OF WHAT THAT TEACHER BRINGS TO THE EQUATION. GREAT LA CAN I ASK MY QUESTION MAY BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT WAY WITH. WITH HOW YOU PERCEIVE YOUR OR HOW YOU VALUE IN ENGAGING YOUR ROLE. IN IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE MAYES FROM. DR COHN MAYBE SOMEBODY WHOSE JOB OFFER THEIR THEIR THEIR OPINION OR. OR EXPERIENCE. I'M KINDA LOOKING AT AS YOU WALK INTO A SCHOOL DOES HE KNOW THERE'S PROBLEMS THERE. I ASSUME YOU MEAN THE SCHOOL BOARD FIRST I DON'T KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO. THIS USELESS TAKE AN IMAGINARY DISTRICT HOW OUT THAT IF THERE% WAS AN IMAGINARY DISTRICT OUT THERE LET'S JUST SAY THE SUPERINTENDENT WASN'T PERFORMING. AND AND OR YOU SAW ADMINISTRATORS AT THE SCHOOL SITE NOT PERFORMING THAT OFTEN CAN LEAD TO SOME OTHER THINGS GOING ON AT THE CAMPUS OF THE DON'T HAVE A. YOU KNOW A A STRONG LEADER THERE WE KNOW THAT THROUGH OUR OWN EXPERIENCE SO WHAT. I'M KIND OF LOOKING AT IT YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU INTERACT WITH THE MANAGEMENT HOW YOU ADDRESSES ISSUES. WHICH MAY ALSO IMPACT HOW HOW HOW THINGS ARE TAUGHT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE SERVICE YEAH I MEAN WE WILL HAVE. CONFIDENTIAL CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR SUPERINTENDENTS AT SORT OF THING. HAVEN'T DONE IN VICTOR VALLEY BUT IN ALMOST ALL OF THE OTHER PLACES WHERE WE'RE WORKING. I'VE PERSONALLY BEEN INVOLVED IN THE BOARD GOVERNANCE TRAINING. AND. DOING IT IN LA UNIFIED ALL THESE OTHER PLACES AND. WHAT WE FIND OUT GOVERNANCE IS A HUGE CHALLENGE? AROUND THE STATE. SOMETIMES. WE ASSOCIATED THE LARGER URBAN'S I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE THE MEDIA COVERS THE LARGER BANDS ON A DAILY BASIS BUT BUT THE IMPORTANCE OF GOVERNANCE. SHOULDN'T BE UNDERESTIMATED ON WE'VE HAD SITUATIONS IN PLACES A THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING IN WHERE THE SUPERINTENDENT HAS HAS LEFT ON. AND PART OF THAT WAS AN HOUR SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT PERFORMANCE IT WAS ABOUT. CONVERSATIONS WITH BULL WORD WHERE YOU ACTUALLY GET TO IS THIS THE RIGHT FIT. IS THIS GOING FORWARD THE WAY IT SHOULD THAT SORT OF THING BUT WE DON'T. WE DON'T COME IN AND SAY YOU GOT BAD PRINCIPLES YOU GOT A BAD SU. HE BETTER DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. BUT IF YOU SEE THAT. WITH THE CAPACITY YOU'RE BUILDING WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION UNNATURAL IMPACT MIGHT BE THERE SOME. SOME CHANGE RIGHT. CORRECT. OTHER QUESTIONS. YEAH I I'M I'M SO INTRIGUED BY. THE WORK ON YOUR SERVE ACT ALMOST LIKE CONSULTANTS TO. SCHOOL DISTRICT I SUPPOSE. I IS THEIR SON. IS THERE A AYE WHAT AYE AYES YOU GUYS YOU GO OUT AND DO ALL THIS WORK ALL OVER THE STATE AND AND AND IN TURN IMPROVE OUTCOMES ARE THERE SOME THINGS THAT WE OUGHT TO BE THINKING ABOUT SYSTEM WIDE SOME LOW HANGING FRUITS AND. BEST PRACTICES AND SPECIAL SAUCE THAT YOU'VE. BEEN ABLE TO EMPLOY EFFECTIVELY TO TURN AROUND SOME SCHOOLS THAT THAT WE OUGHT TO BE THINKING ABOUT IT IN OUR POSITIONS. YEAH I. ONE MOMENT AGO THIS IS GOING TO FINANCE A ONE OF THE THINGS YOU KNOW AND I'M. I LIKE IT'S ITSELF BUT FEE FI AT OUR PRINCIPALS MEETING. THINK THE HE'S THE STRATEGIES THAT WE'VE DEPLOYED DOING THE WORKSHOPS THAT'S BEEN APART OUR BOARD MEETINGS. OUR STRATEGIC PLANNING MEETINGS ARE EL CAP MEETINGS. THIS IS BECOME A FABRIC OF WHAT WE DO THE PART OF OUR PLAYING FIELD EVERYTHING THAT WE DO A LOT OF THE STRATEGIES THAT WE HAVE THERE. SO IF YOU'RE TALKING TO OUR BOARD MEMBERS OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE TEACHERS ARE ADMINISTRATORS. THE WEALTHY IN ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS ARE AWARE OF THE STRATEGIES THAT WE UTILIZE TO CC AND I THINK THAT FROM A. SYSTEM WIDE PERSPECTIVE. IF THAT CAN BE INTEGRATED. SYSTEMATICALLY IN COLLABORATIVE THE WALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BOARD THE ADMINISTRATORS TO TEACHERS TO CLASSIFIED CENTER. I THINK THAT YOU CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT BROUGH SOUNDS LIKE IT SOUNDS LIKE. AND I I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE IN YOUR DISTRICT BUT. I'M BUT. IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH YOU'RE SUGGESTING IT THERE'S AN URGENCY ASSOCIATED WITH THE CC PARTLY THERE BECAUSE THEY WERE CHALLENGES. THEY'RE PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION EVERYONE FEELS THIS KIND OF. SENSE THAT YOU KNOW THEY'RE PART OF THIS PROJECT IN THEIRS ENGAGEMENT FROM THE STATE IN. I WILL NO I WOULD SAY THAT. THERE IS AN URGENCY YET BUT IT'S NOT DRIVEN FROM A MANDATED CC DISTRICT IS GOING TO HAVE TO WANT TO CHANGE THEMSELVES. IF THERE'S GOING TO MAKE THAT IMPACT THAT YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE YOU HAPPEN OUTSIDE FOURTH. THAT'S THEY'RE SAYING SOMETHING THAT YOU MAY NEED TO DO I THINK FOR DISTRICTS THAT. TAKE THAT APPROACH THEN. THAT CHANGE WILL ONLY BE THERE AS LONG AS THAT OUTSIDE PRESSURES HERE BUT I THINK FOR THOSE DISTRICT IT REALLY WANT TO MAKE THE CHANGE THAT THEY NEED TO IMPROVE. THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. DOES CHANGE YOU ANYTIME YOU LOOKED CHANGING THE CULTURE OF AN ORGANIZATION IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGES THAT ANY LEADER TAKES ON. AND I THINK THAT WHEN YOU CAN INSTITUTED AND HAVE. LOOK BACK PROCESSES TO CHECK TO SEE IF THIS IS REALLY HAVING THE IMPACT IF INTENDED THEN YOU COULD HAVE A MUCH MORE. IMPACTFUL. IMPACT ON WHATEVER GOES THAT YOU'RE LOOKING TOWARD. MILLIMETERS AB BED ON THE REASON WHY I THINK RON'S MENTIONED ALL THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS WARY C. C. E. E. HAS BEEN PART OF IS BECAUSE OF RON'S LEADERSHIP. IN BEING VERY OPEN AND BELIEVING IN THE PROCESS OF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT. AND. I KNOWS THERE WERE A LOT OF MENTIONING OF THE WHERE THOUGHT PARTNER AND WE WHERE THOUGH RESPECT. BY TO TO RE OF RIGHT KIND OF HELP. A MY ROLE. CHANGES A LOT AND THEN I JUST LIKE WHEN YOU SHARED ABOUT LIKE THE EVALUATIVE PIECE WHERE IF YOU DO NOTICE THERE NEEDS TO BE. SOME AREAS THAT'S NOT WORKING WELL AND THAT'S WHERE I BELIEVE. THE SUPERINTENDENT HAS OF. A SOMEONE TO BOUNCE IDEAS OR JUST BE REFLECTIVE. WHERE IT'S MORE LIKE A COACH CONSULTANT? AND ACTING I AS A MORE OF A REFLECTIVE RULE AND I HAVE TO SHARE WITH YOU WHEN WE BEGAN THIS PROCESS. IT WAS DR COHN DOCTOR MOLINA MYSELF FROM C. C. ALONG WITH. DOCTOR WILLIAMS IN SITTING UP TOGETHER ALL DAY. LISTENING TO STAKEHOLDERS FROM ALL DIFFERENT GROUPS OF VICTOR VALLEY THAT'S HOW WE BEGAN OUR PROCESSING GATHERING DATA SO IT'S VERY DIFFERENT. ORGANICALLY IN THAT WE'RE NOT JUST LOOKING AT DASH FOR DATA OR TO THOSE NUMBERS AND. SURVEYS WERE ACTUALLY LISTENING TO PEOPLE AND THEY HAVE A FACE TO WHAT WE'RE DOING. SO A BIG. LESSON TO LEARN FOR ME. WHY ARE FOLKS SO RECEPTIVE? TO US. WE DON'T HAVE ANY. OF THE REGULATORY. BUREAUCRATIC AND COMPLIANCE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT OTHER ENTITIES THAT. AND AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE MORE. YOU DIMINISH. THOSE REGULATORY BUREAUCRATIC AND COMPLIANCE RESPONSIBILITIES FROM OTHERS THE GREATER RECEPTIVITY Y. LOG YET AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IF I COULD ON PLAYING AND ALSO AS YOU GUYS ARE LISTING TO. OUR DIFFERENT ROLES THE COUNTY OFFICE DOES PROVIDE. PORT TO OUR DISTRICTS. AND MORE FOR PREVENTION. AND ALSO A AWAY THAT SUPPORTS THEIR BUILDING OF CAPACITY. SO FOR AS I STATED EARLIER EACH GROUP OUR CHIEF ACADEMIC OFF OFFICER MEET WITH ALL. INSTRUCTIONAL LEADERS AN ENTIRE COUNTY. CARDS CBO AYE MEETS WITH ALL THE CBO'S AND WE HAVE BEEN THE SAME MESSAGE EMBEDDED CAPACITY. EVEN AS THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT I VISIT EVERY SINGLE DISTRICT TWENTY THREE OF THEM. I GO TO. I'M NO GOOD DESTRUCTION LOOKS LIKE AND WE DO TALK ABOUT IT. I THINK IT'S THE APPROACH I THINK THAT YOU HAVE YOU HAVE TO HAVE SYSTEM SOMETIMES FOR ACCOUNTABILITY IN EVEN MANDATES BUT IT'S HOW YOU. DELIVER THAT IS HOW YOU DO THAT HOW YOU SERVE AND SUPPORT BUT ALSO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. SO I I WANT YOU TO CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF THE COUNTY. AND THIS WHOLE DYNAMIC THERE IS A DEFINITE WORLD THERE. AND WE SEE IT FROM THE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE. OP AS DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE WITH THEM A TIERED SYSTEM. THAT THERE'S A ROLE FOR US TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP DISTRICTS FROM GETTING INTO A PLACE WHERE THEY HAVE TO GOING TO DIFFERENTIATE ASSISTANCE. BUT WE WERE ACTUALLY HAND IN HAND WITH CC THERE SOME DISTRICTS THAT WE HAVE DOUBLE TEAMED. THERE SOME DISTRICT WE SAID OKAY YOU TO TAKE AT THIS POINT WE'RE GONNA TAKE A THAT PART. BUT IT HAS TO BE CONTINUES COMMUNICATION AND YOU HAVE TO DO IT WOULD STUDENTS AT THE CENTER OF IT ALL. OKAY ARM BREAK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT AYE AYE ISA I LOVED IT WE'RE ABOUT TO HEAR FROM TIME FINANCE IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL I LEAD TO THIS IN THE LAST PANEL I WILL CERTAINLY ASK ABOUT IT BUT OTHER THINGS YOU WANT ME TO ASK THEM. IN RELATION TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND AND THIS. THIS WHOLE CON CONVERSATION ABOUT. YOU KNOW I SEE BOTH CC  <u><c.green>AND</c></u> THE COUNTY OFFICES ARE PROVIDING IMPORTANT SUPPORT. SYSTEMS. ARE THERE THINGS THAT AND WE OUGHT TO BE THINKING ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW BUDGET AND ON THE POLICY SIDE DATE RELATES TO THAT. BALANCES TO. AS TO WHERE THE PROPER MIX OF ROLES ARE BETWEEN THE CC AND THE COUNTIES THE EXTENT TO WHICH AN INDIVIDUAL ALLEGATION BE ABLE TO DETERMINE. WHERE THAT HONOR VENTURA COME FROM OF THE ASSISTANCE? BUSY YOUR UNDERSTANDING UNDER THE. GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT THAT PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE THAT DISTRICTS WILL BE ABLE TO REQUEST AS HE SEES SUPPORT ASSISTANCE WE HAVE THE RESOURCES. TO PROVIDE THAT IF YOU WIND. ARE THE COUNTIES IN THE C. C. E. WORKING COLLABORATIVELY AND IN. SITUATIONS WHERE THERE ARE DISTRICTS IN NEED ASSISTANCE I'D LOVE TO. AND BETTER UNDERSTAND THIS RELATIONSHIP IN THE IN THE ROLES THAT YOU PLAY ON THE SUPPORTIVE SIDE WITH THE DISTRICTS. TYPICALLY. IF A DISTRICT REQUEST OF US. WE CHECK IN WITH THE COUNTY WE TALK ABOUT THEIR CAPACITY OUR CAPACITY AND IN MOST INSTANCES. THE COUNTY THERE SAYS YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE YOU GO AHEAD. YOU WORK WITH THEM OR WE COME TO SOME AGREEMENT AROUND YOU PROVIDE THIS WILL PROVIDE THAT IT HASN'T. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE COUNTY SUIT AT A MEETING WE. HAD SAID. THERE'S A LOT OF WORK FOR EVERYBODY AND SO WE SHOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE TERRITORIAL ABOUT THIS. LET'S GET THE YES WHEN IT COMES TO SERVING DISTRICTS AND SO THAT'S THAT'S THE APPROACH. THE THE OTHER THING IS WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON BEING FLEXIBLE. SO. IF THERE'S A NEW ROLE OR A DIFFERENT ROLE FOR US. WE TAKE THOSE CHALLENGES. WILL BE ANNOUNCING NEXT WEEK ON A NEW PERSON COMING IN TO HEAD UP. WHAT WE'RE CALLING THE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES COLLECTIVE THE SW DE HOW DO YOU GET THE RIGHT KIND OF HELP? TO THOSE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. SO WE SEE OURSELVES AS. ORIGINAL INTENT FLAT AGILE NIMBLE WHEREVER WE NEED TO BE WE CAN GET THERE UNSERVED DISTRICTS. OKAY DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT FROM THE PRETENDING PERSPECTIVE JUST FROM THE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE. EACH COUNTY IS DIFFERENT BUT WITH THE IDENTIFIED MONIES FROM THE GOVERNOR'S RECOMMENDATION WE WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO SERVE AT A HIGH QUALITY. AND I I LVE IS I CAN I CAN ONLY SPEAK FROM MY EXPERIENCE THERE WE HAVE INTENSELY BUILT. OVER THE LAST DECADE SO YOU YOU WON'T FIND A BETTER TING. AD AND WAIT WHAT TO DO. AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT THERE. WITH THE COUNTY OFFICES I MEAN I WOULD ALSO ADVOCATE THAT. IN ANY SORT OF SUPPORT GETS THROWN THEIR WAY BECAUSE I KNOW THAT OUR OUR COUNTY REALLY HELPS US A LOT AND I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW I I I TALK TO THEM ABOUT WHAT KIND OF IDEAS THEY HAVE IN TERMS OF THE TEAMS THEIR BUILDING AND. AND WHAT THEY'VE GOT GOING ON WHAT THEIR FUTURE LOOKS LIKE AND HOW THEY WANT TO SUPPORT US AND I'M. EXCITED AT THE OPPORTUNITY SO THEY ARE OFFERING MISS ACOSTA CHALLENGE BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND IT'S PART OF WHY. THE YOU KNOW THERE'S A QUITE A DISPARITY IF YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S SPENT BY THE STATE ON K. TO TWELVE. AND HOW MUCH ACTUALLY ENDS UP. IN THE DISTRICT'S PER PUPIL. AND A LOT OF IT'S BECAUSE OF THE COUNTY INFRASTRUCTURE FOR EXAMPLE. I AM SO. YOU KNOW WE WE WERE ABOUT TO SEE PROVIDES ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT SERVICES IT'S ALSO. PROP NINETY MINUTES ARE GOING DIRECTLY DISTRICTS YOU KNOW THAT THE OTHER THE OTHER PART OF THIS DILEMMA. NOT AN OVERLY DECISIONS TO MAKE. GET IT COOK. FROM THANK YOU PROCUREMENT. THANK YOU SINGLE FURTHER COMMENT FROM THE PANEL OR FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH VERY INFORMATIVE. AND VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU'RE DOING. WHETHER WE GO TO ARE. LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST PANEL. AND THAT WILL BE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR COUNTY AND SELF OR REGIONAL. STRUCTURES. JESSICA HOLMES. AMBER ALEXANDER DID THEIR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ARE HERE. AND EDGAR COVERDELL AND SIR CORTEZ FROM LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFF. YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY I DON'T WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST WHO HAS GONE VERY SPLIT. GO FORTH. GOOD AFTERNOON JUST GO HOMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M HERE WITH MY COLLEAGUE AMBER ALEXANDER MCGEE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS FOR. ACCOUNTABILITY THE STATE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT AND THEN ALSO HOW. SOME OF THE PROPOSALS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. ROLAND ALL OF THAT. AND THE ADMINISTRATION STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE LCF ACCOUNTABILITY IMPROVEMENTS SYSTEM. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THAT'S THE STRUCTURE ENGAGES ALL LOCAL REGIONAL AND STATE EDUCATIONAL ENTITIES AS WELL AS THEIR STAKEHOLDERS. AND A STRONG NETWORK OF COLLABORATION IN ORDER TO STOP A MINUTE HERE AND JUST KEY IN ON THIS AND I THINK I THOUGHT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT WHAT SUPERINTENDENT BLAKE SAID ABOUT. HOW YOU KNOW IN IN IN OTHER COUNTIES HE'S HEARD SUPERINTENDENT SAY THAT YOU KNOW THEY DON'T THEY DON'T TALK TO THEIR NEIGHBORS THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE AN ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIP TO DO THAT AND I THINK THAT? ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S KEY TO THE STATE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT ON IS ALLOWING PEOPLE TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT RESOURCES ARE OUT THERE. SO THE STATE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. IS. REALLY FOCUSED ON EITHER SIDE A NETWORK BY BEING A NETWORK OF COLLABORATION INNOVATION INFORMATION SHARING. WITH A FOCUS ON IMPROVING ACADEMIC OUTCOMES FOR ALL STUDENTS. AND REALLY CREATING A FOCUSED ON CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT SET ASIDE EIGHT GOALS. SO IN TERMS OF WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES. I'M SURE YOU'VE YOU'VE BUT WE'VE KIND OF ARTY TOUCH ON THE FACT THAT. NEAR THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR IT LEAD COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. AS WELL AS ELEVEN POINT THREE MILLION ON GOING FOR THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE AYE WE TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT THAT IN IN BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE. BUT THE FOCUS OF THOSE FUNDS IS REALLY ON BUILDING. A SUPPORT NETWORK OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SO I WANTED TO STOP RIGHT THERE AND TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT AND SOME OF THE THINGS YOU PART ABOUT IT SENATOR ALLEN. SPECIFICALLY AROUND THE ROLES THAT THAT FOLKS ARE PLAYING IN WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. SO IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE DO TALK ABOUT COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION IS THE PRIMARY SUPPORT PROVIDER FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I WANT TO CLARIFY A FEW THINGS ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE CEMENT MISINFORMATION OUT THERE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT PROPOSE THAT COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION ARE THE ONLY SUPPORT PROVIDERS AVAILABLE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHETHER THEY'RE IDENTIFIED FOR DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE OR NOT. SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE LCF OF FUNDS AND THAT THEY CAN USE TO PROCURE ANY TYPE OF SUPPORT THAT THEY WISH TO TO PROCURE. WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PAN PROPOSES IS THAT IF THE SCHOOLS IDENTIFIED FOR DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE BUT THEY DO NEED TO WORK WITH THEIR COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION? BUT THEY DO NEED TO BRING IN ANOTHER PARTNER BECAUSE IN IN THE INSTANCE OF BEING IDENTIFIED THEY'RE BASICALLY SHOWING THAT. THERE REALLY STRUGGLING AT LEAST ONCE A GROUP OF STUDENTS AND EIGHT WE WANT TO SEE SOMEONE ELSE COME IN AND PROVIDE SINCE SOME SUPPORT. WE ALSO REQUIRE THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS IDENTIFIED AND HAS BEEN IN NEED OF DIFFERENCE IS SYSTEMS EXCEPT ASSISTANCE. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT. WHATEVER THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION SAYS AS WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO THIS IS REALLY AN AT AN OUTGROWTH OF THE WORK AROUND THE LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN. COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION ALREADY WORKED CLOSELY WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS ON THE ALL CAPS. THEY ARE THAT THE REVIEWERS OF THE DISTRICT ALL CAPS AND THEY ARE ON THE APPROVER IS THAT THE DISTRICT ALCOTT. SO IT VERY MUCH MAKES SENSE THAT. IF A SCHOOL DISTRICT ESPECIALLY ONE THAT'S IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE. IS GOING TO TO BE WORKING ON ADDRESSING SOME OF THEIR ISSUES BUT THEY'RE GOING TO BE DOING IT ALONGSIDE THEIR COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. THERE'S ALSO BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION AROUND THE CREATION OF LEAD COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION WHICH IS ANOTHER PIECE OF OUR GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. SO I WANT TO AND GO BACK TO SOMETHING AS SENATOR ALAN THAT YOU MENTIONED ABOUT. THE ROLE OF THE C. C. E. VERSUS THE ROLE OF COUNTIES. WE THINK THAT THE COLLABORATIVE AND COUNTIES BOTH PLAYING IMPORTANT PART IN THE STATE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. THE COUNTIES ARE. I GUESS AT SOME OF OUR FOUR PANELISTS MENTIONED THESE ARE THE THE THE. THE PARTNERS OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THE NATURAL PARTNERS TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY HAVE BEEN THERE HEY UNDERSTAND THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE THERE. EVEN AFTER. A SCHOOL DISTRICT MAYBE IMPROVE THEIR SCORES OR EVEN IF THEY CONTINUE TO DECLINE. THEY ARE THE PARTNER THAT WILL BE THERE FOR THE LONG TERM WE TALKED ABOUT THE. STING SYSTEM OR THE FEDERAL SYSTEM OF SUPPORT WHERE I'M YOU HAD MONEY FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND PEOPLE CAME IN. AND YOU SAW IMPROVEMENTS ARE GAINES BUT IT WAS ONLY AS LONG AS THE MONEY LASTED. pA SENSE OF CONTINUITY. THAT EVEN ONCE. WHOEVER'S PROVIDING SUPPORT LEAVES THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATIONAL BE THERE. THEY'LL BE THERE IN THE GOOD TIMES TO PROVIDE THAT TIER ONE LEVEL OF SUPPORT THEY'LL BE THERE IN THE BAD TIMES TO BE PARTNERS MATURE TO MATURE THREE. SO THAT'S THE CONTINUITY OF THE SYSTEM. WE ALSO AND IN OUR LANGUAGE PROVIDE AVENUES. FOR THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION UMP THE DEAD THE COLLABORATIVE AND THE DEPARTMENT TO ASSIST SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN NEED OF EXTRAORDINARY SUPPORT. THIS IS WHERE WE SEE THE COUNT OF THE COLLABORATIVE REALLY PLAYING AN IMPORTANT PART. WE KNOW THAT SOME OF OUR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. DEFINITELY NEED TO DO SOME WORK ON BUILDING THEIR OWN CAPACITY IN PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. WE THINK THAT THE COLLABORATIVE CAN REALLY BE HELPFUL NOT WORK. I'M WE ALSO SEE THAT THEY CAN BE REALLY HELPFUL ON INCOMING IN THAT TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT MAYBE IN CRISIS OR. ADDED AT RISK FOR BECOMING IDENTIFIED FOR STATE INTERVENTION WHICH IS OUR TEACHER THREE LEVEL OF SUPPORT. OR IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS NOT GOOD. I'M FINALLY OUR PROPOSAL MIX TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO REMOVE THE OLD API INDEX. EH WHILE HOLDING IN PLACE. THE TWENTY THIRTEEN CALCULATION FOR PROGRAMS THAT ARE STILL IN EXISTENCE THAT READ REQUIRE THAT TO TO LET IT GO UP THE FUNDING FOR THOSE PROGRAMS. SO I'M HAPPY TO ENGAGE THEM IN ANY KIND OF SCRATCHING LIKE TO GET ON THIS TOPIC I MISS HER NEVER TO MY PARTNER AND IN BROAD CENTER TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW. I'M WE ENVISION AS THE YET THE MOVING AWAY FROM THIS IDEA OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND GENERAL EDUCATION INTO AND THE FOCUS ON THE WHOLE CHILD. GOOD AFTERNOON NEVER ALEXANDER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. FOLLOWING UP ON MY COLLEAGUES PRESENTATION ON THE COUNTY REGIONALES STRUCTURE GOING TO FOCUS MY REMARKS ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO INCORPORATE SPECIAL EDUCATION LOCAL PLAN AREAS OR SOUTH BUYS INTO THE STATE MIGHT SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. SO OPUS COORDINATE LOCAL SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES AND ALLOCATE SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING TO REGIONAL PROGRAMS AND DISTRICTS. IN THE SPIRIT OF COORDINATION ACROSS THE STATE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES TEN MILLION AN ON GOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING. TO ESTABLISH SIX TO TEN UPPLE LEADS WHO WILL WORK WITH COUNTY OFFICES TO IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES AS PART OF THE STATE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL RECOGNIZES THAT SELFLESS HAVE EXPERTISE IN THE DELIVERY AND MANAGEMENT OF SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES THAT COULD FURTHER ENHANCE THE SUPPORT PROVIDED BY COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. IN THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT BRINGING SUPPERS INTO THE STATE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT IS CRITICAL. GIVEN THAT NEARLY THREE QUARTERS OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IDENTIFIED FOR DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE NEED TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. THE NEED TO INTEGRATE SPECIAL EDUCATION WITH GENERAL EDUCATION IS A THEME THAT HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED TIME AND TIME AGAIN. MOST RECENTLY WITH REPORTS BY BOTH THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE STATE WIDE SPECIAL EDUCATION TASK FORCE. BOTH CALLING FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A UNIFIED SYSTEM WHERE GENERAL IN SPECIAL EDUCATION ARE PART OF A SEAMLESS SYSTEM OF STUDENT SUPPORT. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO BRING FOCUS INTO THE STATE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A REGIONALES STRUCTURE. FURTHERS HIS EFFORTS TO INTEGRATE SPECIAL EDUCATION AND GENERAL EDUCATION INTO ONE COHESIVE ASSIST. ONE COHESIVE SYSTEM AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. A GOOD AFTERNOON SARAH CORTEZ AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AND I WILL BE SPEAKING FROM A HAND OUT THAT WAS DISTRIBUTED EARLIER. I'M SO WHERE WE WERE ASSN A DISK TO DISCUSS OUR ASSOCIATED RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE GOVERNOR'S REGIONAL THE PROPOSALS I'M SO PAGE ONE. ACTUALLY PRODUCE SHOWS A SUMMARY OF THESE PROPOSALS I'M SO WHAT YOU HEARD FROM THE ADMINISTRATION SO THAT YOU PROPOSALS ALL. LIMIT MY COMMENTS TO YOU ARE THE READ THE COUNTY OFFICE REGIONALLY PUT PROPOSAL WHICH IS FOUR MILLION. WHICH IS A FOUR MILLION ONGOING AUGMENTATION AND ALSO THE SELF Y. REGIONALLY PROPOSAL WHICH IS THE TEN MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION. SO MOVING ALONG TO PAGE TWO OF THE HANDOUT DESCRIBES OUR ASSESSMENTS OF THESE PROPOSALS SO OUR CONCERN. WITH THE REGIONALLY PROPOSAL IS THAT A P. IT APPEARS DUPLICATIVE TO BOOK NEWLY ESTABLISHED ROLES WITHIN THE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM AN ALREADY EXISTING REGIONALES STRUCTURE. SO FOR EXAMPLE ELEVEN COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION ALREADY RECEIVE FUNDING SERVICE REGIONAL MEANS. THERE'S ALSO A LACK OF CLARITY SURROUNDING THE ROLE OF THE REGIONAL LEAD SO FOR EXAMPLE. A COUNTY OFFICE REGIONAL LEAVES ARE INTENDED TO BUILD THE CAPACITY COUNTYOFFICE OF EDUCATION BUT ALSO PART OF THEIR ROLE IS TO SUPPORT DISTRICTS DIRECTLY. OMITS UNCLEAR AT WHAT POINT ON A REGIONAL LEGAL SUPPORT DISTRICTS AND HOW DECISIONS TO SUPPORT DISTRICTS WILL BE MADE. THIS LACK OF CLARITY ALSO RAISES CONCERNS FOR THE CELLPHONE ROLES DESPITE THE PROPOSAL'S INTENDING TO. TO ADD SELF WAS TO THE CONVERSATION OF IMPROVING DISTRICTS THE LACK OF CLARISSE CLARITY SURROUNDING THE ROLE COULD RESULT IN COUNTIES DEFERRING DISTRICT SUPPORT TO CELEBUZZ AND AND OUR CONCERN IS THIS WOULD DISCONNECT SPECIAL EDUCATION PERFORMANCE ISSUES. FROM OTHER STUDENT PERFORMANCE ISSUES. ON ANOTHER NOTE CELL PHONES ARE EXPERTS PROVIDING SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES UP BUT THE ISSUES THE DASHBOARD HIGHLIGHTS OUR GENERAL EDUCATION ISSUES SUCH AS TEST SCORES AND SUSPENSION RATES. A WE WOULD CONSIDER THAT THE PERFORMANCE ISSUES THAT THE DASHBOARD HIGHLIGHTS OUR GENERAL EDUCATION ISSUES THAT ARE DICTATED BY THE SAME POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT APPLY TO US ALL STUDENT POPULATIONS. SO FOR EXAMPLE ON PERFORMANCE FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IS LARGELY DETERMINED BY GENERAL EDUCATION TEACHERS WHO HA OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IN THE CLASSROOM. ALL THIS TO SAY IT'S UNCLEAR TO US WHY WE NEED A SEPARATE ENTITY INTERVENING FOR ISSUE SPECIFIC TO STUDENTS WITH THE BEST WITH DISABILITIES AND THEN RELY ON A DIFFERENT SOURCE OF EXPERTISE FOR THOSE SAME ISSUES WHEN THEY OCCUR WITH OTHER STUDENT POPULATIONS. SO PAGE THREE WE DISCUSS OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. SO GIVEN OUR CONCERNS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WE RECOMMEND SHE REJECTING BOTH THE REGIONAL BOTH OF THE REGIONALLY PROPOSALS. IN BECAUSE CREATING OF THE SITE PRE CREATING THESE ROLES ON LEADS TO UNNECESSARY DUPLICATION AND BUT ALSO SELF WAS THE SUPPLE ROLE COULD SILO SUPPORT INSTEAD OF FOSTERING CONVERSATION THAT'S THE ADMINISTRATION INTENDS. SO WE PROPOSE AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT WE THINK MAINTAIN THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF LC A FIVE UP WITHOUT CREATING ADDITIONAL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. WE RECOMMEND USING THE COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE WHICH IS THE NEW ENTITY THAT WAS FORMED GENERALLY TO ASSIST DISTRICTS. BUT USING IT AS AN ENTITY THAT OPERATES SIMILAR EFFECT MATT. ON WHICH IS THE STATE'S FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY ENTITY SO WE RECOGNIZE THIS WOULD BE A CHANGE FROM CURRENT LAW AND WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES. BUT PERFECT ABOUT ONCE A DISTRICT HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE NEEDS FISCAL ASSISTANCE DEVELOPED A TEAM OF EXPERTS. THAT CAN SUPPORT THE DISTRICT IN SOME VERY SPECIFIC AREAS. WE THINK WE COULD BUILD OFF THAT THE SUCCESS THAT WE'VE SEEN WITH THICK MAT OF SUPPORTING DISTRICTS AND MODEL THE COLLABORATIVE TO OPERATE SIMILARLY. SO THE FIRST STEP IN ALTERNATIVE IS THAT THE IDENTIFIED DISTRICT WOULD WORK WITH COUNTY OFFICE OF WITH COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO UNCOVER THEIR ROOT CAUSES IN THE PERFORMANCE ISSUE WERE CAUGHT ROOT CAUSES FOR THEIR PERFORMANCE ISSUES. AND THIS IS SIMILAR TO WHAT THEY HAVE DESCRIBED TODAY AS WHAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY DOING. I'M SO ONCE THE COUNTY COMPLETED THIS RECALLS ANALYSIS THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE THAT THE DISTRICT WOULD THEN WORK WITH THE COLLABORATIVE. TO IDENTIFY AN EXPERT OR TEAM OF EXPERTS THAT THE DISTRICT COULD WORK WITH THAT WOULD ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES FOR PERFORMANCE ISSUES. THE EXPERTS I'M IDENTIFIED HERE COULD BE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION OTHER PROVIDERS OF EDUCATION SERVICES AND EDUCATION CONSULTANT SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THE IDEA IS A COLLABORATIVE WOULD HAVE EXPERTS UNDER CONTRACT SO THAT WE NEEDED EXPERTS WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR DISTRICTS THAT NEED SUPPORT. THE RECOMMENDED SYSTEM WOULD PROVIDE DISTRICTS WITH GREATER CHOICE IN SELECTING EXPERTS ARE NOT REQUIRED DISTRICTS COULD WORK WITH THE COLLABORATIVE TO CHOOSE THE CONTRACTED EXPERTS I'M BEST SUITED TO HELP ADDRESS THEIR KEY PERFORMANCE ISSUES. AND WE THINK DISTRICTS HAVE A STRONG INCENTIVE TO CHOOSE OUR PER SUPPORT PROVIDERS WISELY. UNDER STATE LAW IF DISTRICTS FACE REPERCUSSIONS IF THEY FAIL TO IMPROVE ON THE GET INTO INTENSIVE INTERVENTION AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF POOR DISTRICT PERFORMANCE. ONCE THEY GET INTO IT INTENSIVE INTERVENTION THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION CAN REQUIRE BUDGET AND HEALTHCARE PROVISIONS ON AS WELL AS STAN RESCIND AB DISTRICT BOARD DECISIONS. I'M WITH ALL THE SAID REPRESENT THIS OPTION TO DISPLAY THAT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE MODEL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED OUTCOME OF SUPPORTING DISTRICTS. AND THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ONE MORE SPEAKER. NO OKAY YOU ARE GREAT O. THAT ARE QUESTIONS FROM THE PANEL. LOOK AT. FRESNO APPRECIATIVE RUNS. THOUGHTFUL. PRESENTATIONS I'M. LET ME JUST START BY ASKING THE FOLKS FROM THE PART OF FINANCE DO YOU DO YOU HAVE. I'M SURE YOU DO HAVE THOUGHTS. ASSOCIATE ALEJO'S RECOMMENDATIONS WHAT WHAT ARE YOUR REACTIONS TO THEIR PROPOSALS SURE YEAH. SO I THINK ON. THE UTILIZING THAT THE COLLABORATIVE TO IDENTIFY. THAT EXPERTS TO COME IN AND PROVIDE SUPPORT AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF ISSUES WE HAVE WITH THAT. ONE THE EL CAP IS RELIEVED THE CENTERPIECE OF OUR ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM IT'S WHERE I'M COMMUNITIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS COME TOGETHER AND DISCUSS. DASHBOARD RESULTS AND WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WHAT THEIR PRIORITIES ARE WHAT THEY WANTED YOU TO ADDRESS. I'M ANY SHORTCOMINGS THEY HAVE. AND. THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION ARE REALLY IMPORTANT PARTNER IN ALL OF THAT. ON BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE PROVING THE PLANS. AND WE ARE CONCERNED THAT. S.. MAKING THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION ROLE I'M SIMPLY TO INVOLVE THEMSELVES IN THE RECALLS ANALYSIS REALLY DIVORCES THEM FROM THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING SOLUTIONS. AND THAT'S A REALLY KEY COMPONENT OF THE EL CAP AND WHAT THE COUNTY HAS TO APPROVE SO WE THINK THAT THAT'S AN ISSUE. WE ALSO ARE CONCERNED THAT BRINGING IN THE SHORT TERM PANEL OF EXPERTS ON DOESN'T REALLY GET THAT LONG TERM CHANGE ISSUE THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. AND SO WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THAT. FINALLY I THINK. BUT YOU KNOW WE WERE TALKING ABOUT RICK CAUSE ANALYSIS AND IDENTIFYING I'M A SOLUTION I THINK IT'S WE THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT AS. WE'RE LOOKING AT THE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT MODEL THAT WE'RE NOT. WE'RE NOT BRINGING IN DIFFERENT ENTITIES FOR THOSE TWO DIFFERENT PARTS THOSE TWO THINGS ARE NOT NECESSARILY. SEPARATE PIECES BAD. THE TEAM SHOULD BE WORKING ON IDENTIFYING THE ROOT CAUSES AS WELL AS. WORKING ON FACILITATING ON A CREATION OF THE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS AS ONE PROCESS SO THOSE ARE THREE OF THE THE BIG ISSUES. SO WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING LIKE WITH THAT BUDGET NEGOTIATION OVER THIS DID DO YOU GUYS END OF SAY THE OTHERS IT IS YOU GET NEGOTIATED OUT. AMONGST. SENATORS WITH. DIRECTLY WITH YOU ARE HAPPY JUST STRUCTURALLY HOW. THIS SORT OF. DIFFERENCE THE VISIONS AS TO HOW WE OUGHTA. STRUCTURE THAT THE RECENTLY PROPOSAL. HOW THAT PLAY OUT NOW OVER THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS? AB WILL CERTAINLY AND WE STILL HAVE SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS ON ON THIS TOPIC. YET TO COME. OBVIOUSLY WE PROPOSE WE PRESENT OUR PROPOSAL DELEO PRESENT THERE'S AND THE LEGISLATURE CAN CHOOSE TO. PROPOSED ITS OWN LANGUAGE M. AND HOW IT THINKS THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT SHOULD LOOK. BUT CERTAINLY YOUR PREROGATIVE AND AND YOU KNOW ONE THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE AS AN ADMINISTRATION WERE HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH LEGISLATURE'S THE LA JOH THAN IN THE. BUDGET LANGUAGE NEGOTIATIONS ARE SAT DOWN BY PRO TEM SPEAKER STAFF. I WILL HAVE TO DEFER TO PEOPLE WHO MAKE A LOT MORE MONEY THAN I DO ON THAT. IF YOU GUYS NOW. MAPS I WOULD SAID THAT THE WAY WE WE EXPECT AT THE PALACE THROUGH THE SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS BOTH BOTH HOUSES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS THEIR CONCERNS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. AND AND INCLUDE ANY CHANGES THEM IN AND THAT BUDGET RIGHT THEN THEM THROUGH THAT THERE WILL BE. THAT THIS ISSUE WOULD BE DISCUSSED THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AND THAT WOULD CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE NEGOTIATIONS WE ARE AVAILABLE. TO TO THE LEGISLATURE AS NEITHER OF IN ANY SITUATION SO IF THERE ARE I'M CASES WHERE WHERE YOU WOULD LIKE OUR. SUPPORT RAVI FIAT ALWAYS AVAILABLE IT'S REALLY UP TO AND THE LEGISLATURE TO DECIDE HOW MUCH. HOW MUCH YOU WANT IT TO BE INVOLVED IN THOSE AND NEGOTIATION? SO ITS ARE BUDGET COMMITTEE LEADERSHIP AND CONFERENCE COMMITTEE STAFF THAT AND DECIDE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY WANNA. BY ANDY YOUR ARGUMENTS AND THEN ENGAGE YOU TO HELP WITH THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. MARROW WITH ANYTHING I WOULD EXPECT THAT THAT THE WAVE THIS TURNS AWAY. IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFIC OPINION THAT MEMBERS HAVEN'T AND JIM I'M SURE THAT THERE ARE. MEMBERS WERE NOT PART OF. OUT BUDGET COMMITTEES WHO HAVE. STRONG PREFERENCES FOR ALL THAT WOULD PLAY OUT COMMITTING THOSE CONVERSATIONS WILL HAPPEN IT ITEM. AND A VARIETY OF PLACES HOW DO YOU WHAT'S THE PURPOSE THE PROCEDURE BY WHICH YOU END UP DEVELOPING THESE CRITICS IS ARE YOU GET WITH TEAM OF STAFF TO A FAMILIAR TO. EXAMINE AND ANALYZE THE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND. BASED ON YOUR EXPERTISE IN YOUR READING AND KNOWLEDGE SHE'LL. COME UP HERE STATUTES AND SO THIS IS REALLY THE FOR THE FIRST TIME IT'S COME UP TO YOU BUT WE'VE BEEN WONDERING IF ISSUE AND AND THINKING INTERNALLY ABOUT WHAT WE'VE. WILL THINK OF US OR SYSTEM OF SUPPORT TO LOOK LIKE IT'S OF AND THAT'S INFORMED. THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE PROVIDED TO YOU OKAY. TOLD IN RELATED I'M SURE YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING SIMILAR FOR BOTH THE GOVERNOR'S. THREE COLLEGE FINDING. REJECT AIR PLUS THE. THE ONLINE COLLEGE AND I'D LOVE TO GET THE EARLIER REPORTS ON THOSE TWO. TO TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE I'M SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR CLARIFICATION ON THE SEC ACADEMY. MANDATE QUESTION I THAT THAT THAT'S HELPFUL AND. AT SOME POINT IN BOTH OF US ARE ENGAGING IN A. BITING A REALLY INNOCENT CONVERSATION ABOUT THE WAY WE REALLY LOOK AT SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING IN GENERAL. TIME IS NOT ENTIRELY. THIS I IT IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU PUT YOUR DEBATING HERE ABOUT. NO THE SELF ORIGINALLY THE SILOS AND THE LIKE BUT AND BUT BUT BUT REALLY AND LOOKING AT THE CENTER WHICH WE GOTTA. RETHINK THAT NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. I'D DECISION TO JUST GIVES HIM OUT OF MONEY DALY IS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF KIDS THEY HAVE BEEN AND HOW. THAT'S I REALLY WORKING WELL FOR DISTRICTS ON THE GROUND SO THAT TO ENGAGE OF YOUNG COMPETITION. EXCEPT THAT YOU. THANK YOU. AND SEE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS FOR US PANEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A VERY WELL DONE. WITH THAT. I BELIEVE THIS SPRING SO HOW COME. PUBLIC COMENT SORRY. WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT YOU COME ON UP JUST STATE YOUR NAME.

WHO CALL THEMSELVES THE EQUITY COALITION A WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU'VE TAKEN THE TIME TO LEARN ABOUT THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT WE KNOW THERE'S MUCH MORE TO LEARN? WHAT YOU DIDN'T HEAR THOUGH IS THE ROLE OF COMMUNITY ON WHICH ARE REALLY AN IMPORTANT PLAYER? IN LOCAL CONTROL YOU HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS AND HOW IMPORTANT THEY ARE. BUT LCF F. GAVE FLEXIBILITY OUGHT TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN EXCHANGE FOR ENGAGEMENT INFORMED BY TRANSPARENCY. THE MECHANISMS THAT SUPPORT ALL THAT. ARE REALLY NEED TO BE PULLED APART AND RESOURCES THAT INTENTIONALLY HELP. DISTRICTS DEVELOP CAPACITY TO LEARN HOW TO ENGAGE ARE REALLY CRITICAL AND WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT IN FUTURE LEGISLATION AS WELL AS IN BUDGET. SO I HOPE YOU WILL EXPLORE THAT FURTHER THANK YOU THANK YOU.
