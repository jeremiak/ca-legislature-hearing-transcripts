THANK YOU WE SO WE NOW HAVE A QUORUM I'D LIKE TO ASK THE PRESIDENT PRO TEM OF THE SENATE TONI ATKINS TO COME UP. TO PRESENT SB. ONE BOB I'M GOING TO START BY SAYING THAT. THIS IS A VERY ALL ENCOMPASSING BILL THIS COULD HAVE BEEN -- PROBABLY REFERRED TO SIX DIFFERENT COMMITTEES IT'S BUT THEY ARE REFERRING YOU TO THREE SO WE HAVE TO MOVE IT ON TODAY QUICKLY -- THIS BILL AS A SAID IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN V.. IN THAT IT'S TRYING TO PREVENT ROLL BACKS OF ENVIRONMENTAL -- RULES -- BASED UPON SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE DECIDED IN DC WITHOUT USE OF THE BEST SCIENCE. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN THIS BILL IS THE BEST SCIENCE BE USED TO MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES? AND I THINK THE OPPOSITION IS ARE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AS WITH THAT THEY'RE ALSO WANT -- TO PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT. THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT WHICH HAVE TO DO WITH -- UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. AND SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS ASK THAT THE PRESIDENT PRO TEM PRESENT. ON THE OVER ALL ASPECTS OF THE BILL -- WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO WITH THE OPPOSITE THAT THEN THEN WILL ASK FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN FAVOR THE BAIL? I TO COME UP I'D LIKE TO THEN ASK THE OPPOSITION TO COME UP AND ASK PEOPLE IN OPPOSITION BUT I WANT TO SAVE THE MAIN. PART OF THE TIME FOR TESTIMONY. TO THE QUESTION PERIOD. AND IN THE QUESTION PERIOD WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS BRING UP THE THREE ISSUES THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS BROUGHT UP TO ME. HAVING TO DO. WITH THE TIME -- THE ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIES ARE PROTECTIONS HAVING TO DO WITH -- REGULATIONS ON TROPHIES HAVING TO DO WITH SOME. LABOR ISSUES AND CONFINED SO THAT THE OF THE PROPONENTS CAN ANSWER THE CONCERNS OF THE UP ON ITS. AS THEY'RE BROUGHT UP SAID THAT THE OPPONENTS WITH FIRST ADDRESS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT PROPONENTS WOULD ADDRESS IT. AT CETERA AND THEN WE FINISH THAT PART OF THE QUESTION PERIOD -- WE WOULD GO ON TO GENERAL QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. SO I'M TRYING TO ORGANIZE THIS SO THAT WE THAT WE COME UP WITH WHAT I WOULD SAY THE OPPOSITION IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THE WE HAVE THE CONCERN AND THEN THE ANSWER. OR SO THAT WE HAVE THAT ALL AT ONE TIME IN ONE PLACE RATHER THAN DIVIDING IT UP. FOR YOU TO TRY AND ANSWER THEIR CONCERNS BEFORE THEY'RE RAISED FOR EXAMPLE WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT IF WE CAN HELP IT WILL LET THEM RAISE THEIR CONCERNS AND THEN YOU HAVE THE ANSWER RIGHT THERE. AND MOVE FROM TOPIC TO TOPIC SO THAT'S WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO. MADAM PRESIDENT PRO TEM PLEASE PROCEED. MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SO MUCH COLLEAGUES THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME YOU COULD PUT IT ON CONSENT NAME WE WOULD JUST MOVE ON YEAH. BUT I'VE HUMOR IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING BEFORE WE START A LONG DISCUSSION I'M SURE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COLLEAGUES I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB ONE THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS DEFENSE ACTIVE. TWENTY NINETEEN I BELIEVE SB WANTED SENSIBLE AND NECESSARY LEGISLATION IT MAKES FEDERAL BASELINE STANDARDS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL. AND WORKER PROTECTION ENFORCEABLE UNDER STATE LAW FOR THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION ROLES THEM BACK IN IN DC. SINCE THIS ADMINISTRATION TOOK OFFICE IT IS SYSTEMATICALLY UNDERMINED DECADES OF REGULATORY PROGRESS. DOZENS OF VITAL CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER AND ENDANGERED SPECIES STANDARDS HAVE BEEN WEAKENED OR ELIMINATED. THE AGENCIES CHARGED WITH SAFEGUARDING OUR HEALTH WORKER SAFETY AND NATURAL RESOURCES HAVE BEEN CAPTURED BY THE INDUSTRY'S THEY'RE MEANT TO REGULATE. A COAL LOBBYIST NOW RUNS THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AND OIL LOBBYIST IS IN CHARGE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR. THEY ARE SYSTEMATICALLY UNDER ENFORCING THE LAWS THAT ARE STILL ON THE BOOKS. IN ADDITION THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED A BUDGET BLUEPRINT THAT WOULD REDUCE THE FUNDING OF THE U. S. EPA TO A POINT WHERE THE AGENCY WOULD NO LONGER BE ABLE TO MEANINGFULLY. AND FORCE CLEAN AND CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER LAWS. THE LIST GOES ON IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT -- WORKERS ARE ALSO BEING PUT AT RISK. OSHA ENFORCEMENT IS DOWN SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THE NUMBER OF pOSHA INSPECTOR SUCH HAS REACHED A HISTORIC LOW. THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS SLASH THE NUMBER OF INSPECTORS REDUCED OVERSIGHT OF WORKPLACE HAZARDS INSPECTIONS ON WORKPLACE HE CONDITIONS HAVE FALLEN 50% IN TWO YEARS. AND INSPECTION OF DANGEROUS CHEMICALS AND PESTICIDES HAVE FALLEN BY TWO THIRDS. MEANWHILE THERE'S STRONG EVIDENCE THAT WORKPLACE INCIDENTS IN FATALITIES HAVE INCREASED. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND WORKERS WERE KILLED ON THE JOB MORE THAN THREE MILLION WORKERS SUFFERED SERIOUS INJURY OR ILLNESS. THE NUMBER OF WORKPLACE INJURY AND FATALITY INVESTIGATIONS TRIGGERED WHEN AN INJURY OR DEATH HAPPENS ON THE JOB. ROSE DRAMATICALLY IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN SB ONE WOULD INSULATE CALIFORNIA FROM THIS HARMFUL BACKSLIDING IT SIMPLY PROVIDES THAT WHATEVER ACTIONS THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION MAY TAKE. CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE TO ENFORCE THE SAME ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTIONS THAT HAD BEEN IN EFFECT FOR YEARS AS A MATTER OF STATE LAW. THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER SAFE DRINKING WATER ENDANGERED SPECIES AND WORKER PROTECTION ACTS WERE ALL ADOPTED ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES OVER FORTY YEARS AGO. THIS BILL INSURERS WE KEEP THOSE COMMONSENSE PROTECTIONS. I HAVE BEEN WORKING SINCE DAY ONE WITH THE OPPOSITION FROM THE BEGINNING TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS. RECENT AMENDMENTS BECAUSE OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS TAKEN IN THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT CLARIFY THAT ALL AGENCIES MUST PROVIDE A THIRTY DAY PUBLIC NOTICE AND COMMENT PERIOD. PRIOR TO ADOPTING ANY FEDERAL BASELINE STANDARD. THE AMENDMENTS FURTHER MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT IF AN AGENCY ADOPTS ANYTHING OTHER THAN SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME STANDARD. AS THE FEDERAL BASELINE STANDARD THE AGENCY MUST GO THROUGH THE FULL ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT PROCESS SOMETHING THAT WE DISCUSSED AT LENGTH -- IN THE SENATE AND WE'VE RESPONDED WE ESTABLISHED A MORE OBJECTIVE HEALTH AND SCIENCE BASED STANDARD WE CLARIFIED THAT THE BILL DOES NOT AFFECT VOLUNTARY WATER AGREEMENTS NEGOTIATED BY THE STATE WATER BOARD THAT WAS. A KEY WHEN. WE ADDRESS TROPHY HUNTING CONCERNS THERE MAY BE QUESTIONS LATER AND WE NARROW THE PROVISION THE LABOR PROVISIONS TO APPLY ONLY TO WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY. WHILE THESE AMENDMENTS DON'T REMOVE ALL OF THE OPPOSITION THERE A SIGNIFICANT STEP AND I THINK CHAU MY GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO REALLY TRY TO GET TO SOMETHING. THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE VALUES OF CALIFORNIA AND THE WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE OVER THE LAST FOUR DECADES SO I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO TRY TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. I WOULD SAY THAT SB ONE IS SUPPORTED BY A BROAD CROSS SECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH WORKER SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT I'D LOOK FORWARD TO THE QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENTS AND MISTER CHAIRMAN I DON'T KNOW. HOW MUCH TIME YOU GIVE TO EACH PERSON I'LL LET YOU DICTATE THAT BEFORE WE START [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] HERE -- BURKE WITNESSES WISH TO TALK ABOUT THE GENERAL ASPECTS OF THE BILL. OKAY CAN DOWN BUT I STACEY KLEIN. QUESTION. WITH BOLDNESS -- CONCERN FOR THE OPPOSITION. SO. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADDRESS. NOW DO SO OTHERWISE WE'LL MAKE SURE WE GET. YOUR FULL EIGHT MINUTES THANK. I'M SO JUST PROBABLY HI I'M GOOD MORNING AND AFTERNOON RATHER TURN MEMBERS NIKITA CRIED WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. I'M HERE TODAY TO EXPRESS ENERGY STRONG SUPPORT AND URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB ONE WHICH IS DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH. AND WE'RE DESPITE INCREASINGLY FREQUENT UNPRECEDENTED DISASTERS THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO PUSH AN ANTI AND CONFINEMENT JENDA THAT BENEFITS POLLUTERS AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR NATION'S MOST IMPORTANT ASSETS OUR PEOPLE AND OUR NATURAL RESOURCES. SB ONE SIMPLY SET UP THE PROCESS FOR SPECIFIED AGENCIES TO REGULARLY ASSESSED CHANGES TO FEDERAL STANDARDS AND CONSIDER ADOPTING INTO STATE LAW EXISTING BASELINE FEDERAL PROTECTIONS FOR CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER ENDANGERED SPECIES WORKER SAFETY AND SAFE DRINKING WATER. CALIFORNIA HAS AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO BUILD OUT ITS ENVIRONMENT LEADERSHIP AND PUT IN PLACE AN EVEN STRONGER FIREWALL AGAINST THE SHORT SIGHTED. ATTACKS OF THE HOSTILE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION THANK YOU AND I ARE DRIVE OUT. RIGHT THANK YOU -- CAM DELFINO WITH DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE -- I AM GOING TO ACTUALLY SAVE MY TIME FOR WHEN THE QUESTIONS ARISE BUT OF COURSE WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AND WHAT. MR CHEN MEMBERS CAITLIN VEGA FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB. ONE AND WE HAVE SEEN UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION A STEADY EROSION OF WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECTIONS BOTH IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT AND THE RESOURCES TO THE AGENCY BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF THE STANDARDS THEMSELVES. THERE WERE MANY REGULATIONS PUT INTO PLACE -- THAT SOME OF OUR UNION SPENT DECADES LITERALLY FORTY YEARS FIGHTING TO GET WHETHER IT'S PROTECTIONS AGAINST SELA CLOSEST EXPOSURE -- REQUIREMENTS THAT EMPLOYERS MAINTAIN RECORDS OF WORKER INJURIES I REQUIREMENTS THAT FEDERAL CONTRACTORS DISCLOSE HOW MANY INJURIES THEY HAVE ON THE JOB. THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS SYSTEMATICALLY GONE THROUGH. WORKER PROTECTION AFTER WORKER PROTECTION REPEAL THEM WITHDRAWN THEM UNDERMINE THEM AND SO FOR US. WELL STATE LAWS OFTEN STRONGER. WELL STATE LAWS OFTEN STRONGER THAN THAN THE FEDERAL LAW IT IS A PATCHWORK AND SO WHEN THE FEDERAL LAW IS -- WITHDRAWN ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE IS A GAP AND WORKERS ARE UNPROTECTED AND THAT'S WHY WE THINK THIS APPROACH IS SO IMPORTANT THANK YOU THANK YOU.

OPENING AND THEN WE'LL GET INTO THE DETAILS LATER WITH THAT THE YEAH SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS. WHAT I WANT TO DO IS TAKE MOST OF THAT TIME IN THE QUESTION PERIOD BECAUSE WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS DEAL WITH THE SPECIFIC TECHNICAL ISSUES? FOR EXAMPLE THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT AND HOW THAT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT. ARE INTERFERE WITH -- THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT YOU GET OUT OF THE DELTA. SO IT AND WHAT. WHAT I'VE DONE WITH THE PROPONENTS WHO SAY THEY'VE TAKEN ABOUT TWO MINUTES TO TALK GENERALLY ABOUT THE BELL? AND THEN. AS SOON AS ARM IN THE QUESTION PERIOD WE CAN GET INTO THE DETAILS. AND HAVE A PROPONENTS SPEAK ON THE TOPIC EXCUSE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THE TOPIC THE PROFOUND ANSWER QUESTIONS FROM FOLKS HERE AND THEN DEAL WITH THE NEXT TOPIC. BECAUSE THESE ARE.

I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO ALTHOUGH I THINK THAT'S A DEPARTURE FROM HOW WE NORMALLY OPERATE THE COMMITTEE CHAIR -- AND I'M NOT CERTAIN YOU'RE NOT PLANNING ON TIMING. THE RESPONSE WILL MAKE SURE EVERYBODY GETS ENOUGH TIME I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THOSE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT AND IN OPPOSITION HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY LAID OUT THERE CASE. IN THEIR INITIAL -- COMMENTS BEFORE WE START DIGGING INTO -- YEAH WELL BUT AGAIN ORDINARILY NOW ABOUT TWO MINUTES TO SIDE THEY'RE WELCOME TO TAKE TWO MINUTES NOW BUT I'D LIKE TO TAKE MORE OF THE TIME. IN THE QUESTION PERIOD WE CAN ALL CONCENTRATE ON ONE ISSUE AT A TIME. BUT THE V. EIGHT THEY'LL BE AT LEAST EIGHT MINUTES TOTAL FOR BOTH SIDES AND IF. AND IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE OR TWO NOW. TO STATE YOUR GENERAL CASE AND THEN WE'LL GET INTO THE DETAILS. IN THE QUESTION PERIOD. OKAY OUT I THINK WE'RE CLEAR ON THE FORMAT SO I WILL JUST PRESENTED GENERAL ONE TO TWO MINUTES AND RESERVE THE SICK RIGHT MINUTES FOR QUESTIONS THEM. YEAH OKAY. I WANT TO BEGIN BY STATING THAT THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER. I'M SORRY IT'S ADAM RIGHT IN BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN HERE REGRETTABLY UNFORTUNATELY IN OPPOSITION TO SB -- ONE AND I WANNA BE CLEAR AND NOT BECAUSE WE DISAGREE OR OPPOSE THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR. TO PRESERVE CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL AND LABOR LEADERSHIP AND STANDARDS FROM FEDERAL ROLL BACKS EVERYTHING THE AUTHOR STATE IN TERMS OF THE INTENT WE AGREE WITH AND ACTUALLY YOU WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE AND WE'VE. PROVIDED AMENDMENTS WHICH WE BELIEVE PRESERVE ALL OF THOSE STATED GOALS WHILE REMOVING EVERY SINGLE -- SIGNED OPPOSITION FROM INDUSTRY FROM THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS FROM AGRICULTURAL FROM THE THE SIX OR SEVEN A CENTRAL VALLEY COUNTIES OUT OF ALSO OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. UNFORTUNATE WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE WE DO OPPOSE SOME OF THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL WHICH WE BELIEVE HAVE SIGNIFICANT. POSSIBLY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES TO THE REGULATED COMMUNITY THAT ARMAMENTS ADDRESS AND AGAIN PRESERVE ALL OF SB ONE STATED INTENT -- WE I'D LIKE TO JUST HIGHLIGHT THE THREE MAIN ISSUES ONE WE WE DO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE THAT THERE IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT NOTICE AND COMMENT IN THE BILL FOR THE PROPAGATION OF RULE MAKING. TITLE ONE HUNDRED CHANGES WITHOUT REGULATORY AFFECT ARE MEANT FOR CHANGES SUCH AS PERIODS COMMAS DELETIONS IT DOES NOT PROVIDE A FULLY PA PROCESS WE PROPOSED A VERY MODERN POSITION OF EMERGENCY RULE MAKING WHICH IS A FIVE DAY NOTICE AND COMMENT. WITH A TEN DAY -- L. REVIEW PERIOD THAT'S CURRENTLY. NOT IN THE BILL AS THEY WAVES -- OIL REVIEW. SECOND WE HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH THE STUDENTS WHO PROVISIONS HOWEVER I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS. ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL CITIZENS WHO PROVISIONS OF SB ONE WITH THE PROPONENTS. HOWEVER THIS BILL EXPANDS PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR THE LABOR STANDARDS SUCH THAT -- TRIAL ATTORNEYS CAN BRING UP -- A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION ON BEHALF OF THEPUBLIC INTEREST TO ENFORCE WAIT AN HOUR LAWS. THAT IS AN EXPANSION NOT A PRESERVATION OF EXISTING STATUS QUO UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. AND FOR THAT I BROUGHT BEN AT BEING TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON THE LABOR VERSIONS AND LASTLY -- THE STATE WATER PROJECT VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY SB ONE AND WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ACROSS THE ENTIRE COALITION ON THAT PROVISION SPECIFICALLY. OKAY RESERVE TIME THAT'S GREAT AND THEN I WILL GET INTO EACH ONE OF THOSE SEPARATELY IN THE QUESTION PERIOD -- SO IF WE CAN HAVE OTHERS. IF PEOPLE CAN ANNOUNCE WHO THEY ARE AND MISSION. NO WELL KRAMER'S OF THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION WE'RE OPPOSE THE ONE OTHER POINT THAT YOU MENTIONED IN. YOUR INTRODUCTION WAS SECTION ONE OF THE BILL WITH THE TROPHY HUNTING PROVISION THAT I'M WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK FURTHER ABOUT WHEN WE GET INTO QUESTIONS GREAT. I'M JENNIFER PAIR THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS WERE OPPOSE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE ESSAY PROVISIONS THAT WOULD LOCK IN THE ENVIRONMENT. CHECK IT ON THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT PROVISIONS THAT WOULD LOCK IN CURRENT ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT. PERMIT TERMS THAT -- WOULD NOT ALLOW FOR SCIENCE TO ACTUALLY BE USED TO UPDATE OVER TIME INCLUDING RIGHT NOW. ANYONE ELSE. ALL RIGHT.

GOOD AFTERNOON ADAM ROBIN WITH THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION WE APPRECIATE THE GOALS THE BILL WE APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD INSULATE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS -- BUT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE WATER SUPPLY IMPLICATIONS OF OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. OKAY THIS IS ABOUT I APOLOGIZE JUST GOT TEXAS FROM ANOTHER -- LOBBYIST. ON BEHALF OF THE THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY EXCHANGE CONTRACTORS WHO POSE Là CEMENT THANK YOU MR ROBBIE ANI WE'RE ALWAYS GLAD TO HEAR FROM. ALL RIGHT -- SO. OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE CONCERNS FROM WATER AGENCIES AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS BRING UP BUT TECHNICAL EXPERT. FROM THE PROPONENTS AND THE TECHNICAL EXPERT FROM THE UPPER LIMITS ON THIS ISSUE. AND HAVE THAT DISCUSSED. AND A IF. THE PRESIDENT PRO TEM -- ANYTIME YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING ARE YOUR PRESIDENT PRO TEM. WE TWO WOULD YOU TELL MY SENATORS THAT. I WILL I WILL DEFER TO THE EXPERTS AN AD IN AS I FEEL NECESSARY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN CHIRLA MISS DELFINO. IS EARLIER IS THAT WHO YOU WOULD LIKE TO START YES ON TO LOOSELY SO WHERE LA FOR THE OPPONENT WHAT THEIR CONCERN IS IN DETAIL. AND THEN GET A D. CAL RESPONSE SURE THANK YOU -- I DID FORGET TO MENTION WE ALSO ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE INTENT OF THIS BILL I WE WE HAVE MADE OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF INVESTMENTS -- FIND JUST REINTRODUCE YOURSELF I'M JENNIFER PAIR OF THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS SWITCHES THAT ORGANIZATION OF TWENTY SEVEN PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THAT RECEIVE WATER FROM THE STATE WATER PROJECT. AGAIN WE DO SUPPORT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL -- OUTSIDE THIS BILL WE MAKE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF INVESTMENTS IN SCIENCE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TO MANAGE THE DELTA AND ITS RESOURCES. A BRIEF HISTORY TO UNDERSTAND OUR OPPOSITION TO THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT PORTION IS IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND NINE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ISSUED BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS UNDER THE FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT. THEY ARE CURRENTLY BEING RE CONSULTED ON NOW IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SAID THERE'S A LOT OF UPDATES TO MAKE WE NEED TO RE ENTER THEIR TEN YEARS OLD. WE'RE GONNA START THAT PROCESS IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE COMPLETED IN THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS. AT THE SAME TIME THE STATE GOVERNMENT D. W. R. IN DEPARTMENT OF FISH WILDLIFE OPTED TO PURSUE A PERMIT THAT IS A STANDALONE STATE PERMIT FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT OPERATIONS. THAT PROCESS IS ALSO UNDER WAY THAT WILL -- ALLOW THE STATE TO BOTH INDEPENDENTLY MAKE. DECISIONS ABOUT STATE LISTED AB ENDANGERED SPECIES AS WELL AS IMPLEMENTED AFTER MANAGEMENT AND THIS IS REALLY KEY BECAUSE WE SENT THE LAST BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS WE'VE. BEEN RESEARCHING AT THE TUNE OF OVER FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN THE DELTA TO MEET THE CO EQUAL GOALS. THE WHOLE WATER SYSTEM IS MOVING TOWARDS A STRUCTURED DECISION MAKING SCIENCE BASED DECISION MAKING PROCESS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITHIN OUR PERMITS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT. THE LINKAGE TO THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT TO THIS BILL IS TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT ALLOW THE FLEXIBILITY AND SAYS WHAT WAS GOING ON ON JANUARY IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WILL STAY IN PLACE ON THE STATE SIDE. MEANS THAT THERE'S NO FLEXIBILITY OFFERED TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT WITHIN THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT. THE STATE WATER PROJECT CONTRIBUTES TO THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT IN THREE WAYS WE PLACE A SURCHARGE ON OURDIVERSIONS FOR SCIENCE AND HABITAT. WE PLACE A SURCHARGE ON OUR DIVERSIONS TO PURCHASE WATER. FROM A WILLING FOLLOWING LANDOWNERS AND WE PROVIDE -- FOR WATER IS PART OF A PART OF THE PACKAGE IF WE DO NOT HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO EITHER. IMPLEMENT A SCIENCE BASED DECISION PROCESS OR OUR OUR OPERATIONAL CRITERIA SO CONSTRAIN THAT WE CAN'T OFFER THAT VOLUNTARY WATER THE STATE WATER PROJECT CANNOT PARTICIPATE IN A VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT. I'M NOT SURE THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT WOULD BE ABLE TO BE SUSTAINED WITHOUT STATE WATER PROJECT PARTICIPATION. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS -- STAFF AND PROPONENTS WE THINK THERE ARE SOME AMENDMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE WE THE REST OF THE BILL IS REALLY FOCUSED ON THE REGULATION AND STATUTES SECTION WHERE THIS ONE PORTION OF THE BILL FOCUSES ON THE PERMIT LEVEL THE ACTUAL CRITERIA AND AN EXISTING PERMIT. THAT IS REALLY THE PRIMARY BASIS OF THE CONCERN WE HAVE AS IT RELATES TO BOTH. ONGOING STATE WATER PROJECT OPERATIONS AND THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT. IF WE WERE ABLE TO AMEND THAT PORTION WE WOULD BE ABLE TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION. IT SEEMS SO NOW I WANT TO HEAR ON THAT TOPIC FROM THE PROPONENTS AND THEN HAVE QUESTIONS ON THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC SO THIS IS I WON UP. ALL YOU WANT TO ADD SOMETHING ON THIS TOPIC OKAY JUST TRIED TO MAKE IT SHORT SO ALSO INCLUDED IN THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT SECTION IS SUBSECTION G. WHICH IS AN ATTEMPT. TO APPLY CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT RULES TO THE OPERATION OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT A FEDERAL PROJECT. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS OF THE MOVEMENT OF WATER FOR THOSE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT WHICH IS TWO POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS AND THOUSANDS OF FARMS. ANDSO THAT SUBSECTION IS ALSO PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE THE THE CALIPERS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO APPLY ITS RULES TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL CONCERN TO THE ENDANGERED SPECIES SECTION. EXCELLENT THANK YOU CHAIR QUIRK. I HAVE ADDITIONAL BY ON THE SAME ALL RIGHT AND I HAD. WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT ADD LANGUAGE ABOUT VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS BUT IT TALKS ABOUT THE PROCESS OF VOLUNTEER AGREEMENTS WITH WHICH MISS UNDERSTANDS OUR OPPOSITION WE'VE NEVER. ARGUE THAT SB ONE AFFECTS THE PROCESS TO ENTER INTO A VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ESSENTIALLY FREEZING THE INDIVIDUAL PERMITS ON AN ENDANGERED SPECIES ACTS SUCH THAT. YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ADAPT YOUR VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS WILL INFORM THE STATE WATER PROJECT SO WE JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE LANGUAGE WHICH WE APPRECIATE DOES NOT ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS AT ALL. AND JUST WHEN THE FLAG THAT BEFORE WE ENTER INTO THE OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MADAM EXPERTS HAVE ANY INTRODUCE YOURSELF IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE. SO OUR MINUTES YEAH OKAY I'LL TRY TO DO THIS AND FOUR MINUTES NUTS SO MY NAME IS THAT CAN DELFINO AND I'M WITH DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE AND JUST AS A LITTLE OF BACKGROUND. MY ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN THE VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT PROCESS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN IN FACT WE WERE JUST IN A NICE LONG MEETING WITH THE TWO SECRETARIES -- DISCUSSING POLICY ISSUES A AS A PERTAINS THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT SO AS A AS A JUST A THRESHOLD MATTER -- IT WAS NOT OUR INTENT TO WRITE A BILL IN A WAY THAT WOULD UNDERMINE A SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF A VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT PROCESS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE STRONGLY. THAT A COLLABORATIVE CONSENSUS BASED OUTCOME AS A PERTAINS TO THE WATER QUALITY STANDARDS FOR THE BAY DELTA WOULD BE THE IDEAL SOLUTION RATHER THAN JUST GOING BACK INTO OUR OLD KANSEN LITIGATING WHICH FRANKLY DOES NOT GET US ANYWHERE. SO WITH THAT BEING SAID I JUST WANT TO TAKE ONE MINUTE TO EXPLAIN GENERALLY SPEAKING WHAT THE ES A SECTION OF THIS BILL DOES -- YES SAY ENDANGERED SPECIES ARI. ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL DOES -- SO WHEN THIS BILL WAS WRITTEN. I ACTUALLY WAS THE PRECURSOR WAS SB FORTY NINE AND NOW IT'S SB ONE WE WERE FACING A NEW FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION WHO HAD RETTY MUCH DECLARED THAT THEY DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT THEY WERE STARTING. LISTING DE DE LISTINGS ARE REMOVALS OF SPECIES FROM PROTECTIONS OF THE ENDANGERED SPECIES. LIST AND WE WERE WORRIED THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE FACING AN ONSLAUGHT SO THE PROVISION WAS WRITTEN SO THAT IF IN THE EVENT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CHANGES A RULE OR REGULATION. UNDER THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT IT WOULD TRIGGER REVIEW BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IN THE FISHING GAME COMMISSION TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THAT WOULD THEN. WARRANT THEM PLACING THE ENDING OF THAT SPECIES THAT QUESTION ON THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY STATE LISTED ON THE STATE ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST. IT ALSO ENCOMPASS BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS AND INCIDENTAL STATE BEEN CELL TAKE STATEMENTS ARE PERMITS WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER TWO PROVISIONS REGARDING AIR AND WATER. BECAUSE UNLIKE THE OTHER TWO PROVISIONS REGARDING PORTER COLOGNE AND THE CLEAN AIR ACT WHEN CLEAN WATER ACT IS THERE'S FEDERAL DELEGATION TO THE STATE ON IMPLEMENTING THOSE PARTICULAR. ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS BUT WE OF PARALLEL PROGRAMS UNDER THE ENDANGERED SPECIES WORLD. SO IN ORDER TO ENCOMPASS ALL OF THE PROTECTIONS ACCORDED TO SEE IT. LISTED FEDERALLY LISTED SPECIES WE BELIEVED IT WAS IMPORTANT TO INCORPORATE CHANGES TO UNDERLYING BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS AND INTERNAL TAKE STATEMENTS. AND AND IF THERE'S A CHANGE TO AN A BIOLOGICAL OPINION OR INCIDENTAL TAKE STATEMENT THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. I HAS DECIDED IS SUBSTANTIAL ENOUGH THAT IT IS A WEAKENING OF THE UNDERLYING FEDERAL STANDARD THEY THEN WOULD TAKE ACTION TO OTHER HAVE THE COMMISSION EITHER MAKE THAT SPECIES. Là THAT'S LISTED UNDER THE FEDERAL ACT BUT NOT THE STATE ACT PLACED UNDER STATE. PROTECTION OR PUT IN PLACE IN A IN A PERMIT THAT WOULD PROVIDE ADDITION THAT THAT BACKSTOP THAT INCREMENTAL BACKSTOP THAT WAS FORMALLY LOST WITH THE CHANGE IN THE BIOLOGICAL OPINION. SO WITH RESPECT TO THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED WITH RESPECT TO WATER -- AND THE CHANGES THAT ARE HAVE BEEN PROPOSED BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO THE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS THAT GOVERN THE RULES -- THAT'S THE WAY THE FEDERAL WATER PROJECT IS -- OF RUN. IS A IT THE THE WHAT THE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE ISSUED. OF ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT THAN THE PREVIOUS BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS AND IT WILL BE UP AND IF THIS BILL BECOMES LAW. IT WOULD BE UP TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT -- THOSE OPINIONS ARE LESS PROTECTIVE THEN THE PRE EXIST THE PREVIOUS TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT OPINIONS. I WILL SAY IT WAS NEVER OUR INTENT IN WRITING THIS BILL TO FREEZE IN TIME SCIENTIFIC STANDARDS. OR REQUIREMENTS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND IGNORE ANY KIND OF NEW AND UPDATED SCIENCE -- THAT WAS NEVER OUR INTENTION IN FACT WE AMENDED THE BILL BASED ON CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION TO INCLUDE A REQUIREMENT THAT THE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WHILE I HAVE TO LOOK AT BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE. NOW I THINK THAT THIS IS AN AREA THAT WE COULD PROBABLY CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS ON AND IN FACT WE WILL HAVE A CONTINUED IF IF THE BILL COMES OUT OF COMMITTEE. WE WOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS TO CLARIFY THAT FURTHER -- AND IN FACT I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT -- UNDER THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT BIOLOGICAL OPINION THERE HAVE BEEN SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN HOW THEY CALCULATE TAKE FOR SAY DELTA SMELT SO EVEN THOSE OPINIONS HAVEN'T BEEN FROZEN IN TIME -- HAD HAVE CHANGED -- AM UP SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND PRIOR TO THE RENEGOTIATION OF CONSULTATION IN THESE NEW BIOLOGICAL OPINION SO. AGAIN IT WAS NEVER OUR INTENT TO FREEZE SCIENCE IN TIME THAT WOULD BE FRANKLY ANTITHETICAL TO WHAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITIES BEEN SAYING ABOUT THIS BILL. WITH RESPECT TO THE VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS I WOULD JUST SIMPLY STATE THAT AGAIN IT WAS NOT OUR INTENT TO AFFECT THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS. AND TO BE CEAR RIGHT NOW WE ARE ONLY IN A PROCESS WITH RESPECT TO THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS -- WE ARE -- IN THE INVOLVED IN NEGOTIATIONS OVER A SET OF PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD BY THE TRIP BY SOME OF THE TRIBUTARIES. ON THIS IS NOT A PROCESS THOUGH THAT IS PROCEEDING UNDER THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT. SO WHEN WE WROTE OUR LANGUAGE REGARDING NOT INTERFERING WITH THE VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WE PUT IT INTO THE CLEAN WATER PROVISION. BECAUSE THE VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS ARE ABOUT HOW WE IMPLEMENT THE PORTER COLOGNE ACT AND ACHIEVE WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVES RELATIVE TO SALMON DOUBLING. AND THE VIABILITY OF NATIVE FISH AND IT'S A MUCH BROADER SET OF SPECIES AND IT'S A MUCH BROADER SET OF OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO ACHIEVE THROUGH THOSE UP THROUGH THAT PROCESS. AGAIN WITH THAT BEING SAID WE WOULD VERY MUCH WANT TO CONTINUE TO DISCUSS WITH THE OPPOSITION -- WAYS OF CLARIFYING HOW YOU ARE NOT TRYING TO FREEZE IN TIME STANDARDS AND ALSO THE WHAT I HAD. THOUGHT WAS A LARGE AMOUNT OF DISCRETION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. ABOUT HOW THEY INTERPRET WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING OKAY. SO REALLY QUICKLY BECAUSE I IT DIDN'T GET TAKEN NO WELLS POINT I'M VERY ALL RIGHT BUT THEY DID ASK A LOT -- SO WITH RESPECT TO KNOW WELLS POINT ON THE APPLICATION OF SEIZE THE TO THE TO THE USER I'M SORRY THIS CALIFORNIAN INTERNET SPECIES ACT I APOLOGIZE -- THE CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT TO THE STEP TO THE FEDERAL PROJECT I WOULD NOTE. THAT. ALREADY WE BELIEVE THAT THE CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT APPLIES TO THE FEDERAL WATER PROJECT AND IN FACT THERE IS LONG STANDING LAW. UNDER CALIFORNIA V. US IN WHICH IT INTERPRETED -- SECTION EIGHT OF THE RECLAMATION ACT WHICH TALKS ABOUT HOW THE STATE MAY IMPOSE CONDITIONS ON THE CONTROL APPROPRIATION USE AND DISTRIBUTION OF WATER THROUGH RECLAMATION PROJECTS. AND SO WE BELIEVE ACTUALLY THAT IT IS -- CLARIFYING ED THAT C. SO PLY I'M SORRY CALIFORNIA DANGER SPECIES ACT APPLY BUT WOULD ALSO POINT TO THE FACT THAT THERE IS -- CORRESPONDENCE -- FROM TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT FROM THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE'S STATING THAT WHILE LONG FIN SMELLED ARE NOT A FEDERALLY LISTED SPECIES. THAT THEY WOULD ABIDE BY THE STATE RULES UNDER THE CALIFORNIAN ARE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT WITH RESPECT TO HOW THEY OPERATE THE FEDERAL PROJECT. SO IT IS I THINK -- MAYBE THE OPPOSITION WOULD LIKE IT -- IF THE UNIQUE IT WAS LESS CLEAR ABOUT THE LETS ME THANK ABOUT BUT THEY RIGHT ALL RIGHT BUT I'M JUST SIMPLY POINTING OUT THAT -- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT -- AT THAT THE FEDERAL PROJECT CURRENTLY AND HAS UNDER A SORT OF A LONG STANDING PRACTICE OF DIFFERENCE TO STATE LAW. HAS HAS ABIDED BY STATE RULES WITH RESPECT TO THE OPERATION OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT SO WHAT IS PUT INTO THIS BILL IS NOT. SOME GROUND BREAKING PROPOSITION SO I JUST ONE POINT THAT OUT OKAY THANK YOU -- WELL. YEAH THAT WAS IN THAT IT'S IT'S ALL RIGHT IT LOOK I WOULD HAVE INTERRUPTED YOU IF I HAD THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS GOING -- BEYOND THE SCOPE BUT YEAH I FRANKLY EVERY MINUTE WAS NEEDED FOR WHAT YOU WERE DOING. ALL RIGHT -- YOU HAVE A GOOD AND JUST A SECOND. MISTER MANNING ARE YOU STANDING THERE FOR A REASON. HI I'M GONNA LET YOU SPEAK BECAUSE MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M THE ONLY ONE HERE I THINK REPRESENTING CVP CONTRACTOR SO AT THE PROPER TIME I'D BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS THESE HE IS THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT -- IN THE APPLICATION OF THE CALIFORNIAN DANGER SPECIES OUT TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT WHICH WAS JUST ADDRESS OKAY WHEN YOU'RE WHEN I'M NOT SURE I WILL HAVE TIME BUT WE'LL SEE OKAY WELL I JUST LIKE TO CORRECT THE RECORD BECAUSE IT DOESN'T APPLY. SO ALL RIGHT THANK FINE OKAY FINE -- AT THIS POINT WE'VE HEARD A LOT LET'S HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT PRO TEM AND THEN LET'S GET TO IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY. AND THEN WE'LL GET TO QUESTIONS ON THIS PARTICULAR AREA MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU AND COLLEAGUES YOU CAN SEE THE NATURE OF OUR ONGOING CONVERSATIONS THROUGH. THREE COMMITTEES IN THE ASSEMBLY I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE AS YOU'VE HEARD WALL MANY OF YOU MAY NOT BE IS IT ENGROSSED WITH SOME OF THE DETAILS. IT'S IMPORTANT I AND WE HAVE TRIED VERY HARD NOT TO MISS SOME OF THE IMPORTANT PIECES. OF WHAT THEY ARE DISCUSSING HERE -- BUT I HOPE IT UNDERSCORES THE FACT THAT WE ARE TAKING THESE ISSUES VERY SERIOUSLY WE ARE INCLUDING THINGS IN THE LEGISLATION. TO GET TO A NUMBER OF THE POINTS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED AS QUESTIONS AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT. BUT OUT WE WANT THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON ALL OF THESE ISSUES WHETHER WE'RE TALKING THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT -- THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS WE HAVE NOW ENGAGE THE ADMINISTRATION. ARE BECAUSE THIS IS FAR REACHING BEYOND JUST A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WE CAN BANTER BACK AND FORTH WITH ATTORNEYS I MIGHT ADD -- YOU CITY. I GIVE YOU A LOT OF CREDIT. I'VE LEARNED A LOT THROUGH THIS PROCESS BUT I DO THINK WHAT'S VERY IMPORTANT IS THAT WE ARE ENGAGING ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS THE IN THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOW ENGAGED SO THAT WE'RE NOT MISSING ANYTHING. AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK IN THIS IN THIS WAY AS YOU CAN SEE WHAT IT'S IT'S BEEN LIKE IN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE ON EVERY ISSUE. THERE ARE MORE THAN JUST THESE TWO ISSUES THAT WE'VE TAKEN AMENDMENTS ON AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS RIGHT AND AND I'LL ADD THAT -- THE INTENT HERE IS THAT ANY ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS BE TAKEN IN THE THIRD COMMITTEE WHICH WILL BE A JUDICIARY -- AND WE'RE NOT ASKING WE AS E. S. T. M. ARE NOT ASKING FOR ANY AMENDMENTS. AT THIS TIME. WE THINK THE BILL'S FINE. BUT WE ALSO REALIZE THERE'S CONCERN HERE AND WE WANT TO GET THEM -- WE WANT TO GET THEM RESOLVED SO QUESTIONS. I THINK IT. THIS. IS IT A MISTER HOLDEN. MY MIND WAS MORE OF A COMMENT I THINK THAT -- AND I DO APPRECIATE -- SORT OF REORGANIZING THE PRESENTATION SO THAT WE CAN HAVE SORT OF THE ARGUMENTS PRESENTED BACK AND FORTH RESPONSES SO WHAT I HEARD. WAS THAT FROM THE PROPONENTS POSITION THAT THIS ISSUE OF THE AND YES YES A IS STILL OPEN. FOR DISCUSSION AND THAT THE THE TIME FRAME. THERE WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE BILL. WAS NOT DESIGNED -- TO PRECLUDE FROM THERE BEING SOME FLEXIBILITY -- TO BE ADDRESSED AND I GUESS. HOW THAT ULTIMATELY IS ADDRESSES THE WORK IN PROGRESS BUT? THERE'S STILL SOME OPENNESS. TO THE THE ISSUE THAT WAS BROUGHT FORTH THAT'S HER I'M JUST I WILL BE IN THE LAST COMMITTEE AND JUDICIARY SO I MY MY I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE ON TRACKING. WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND WHERE THE EXPECTATION AND? OF WHERE THE BILL WAS DESIGNED TO GO. AND HOW IT'S BEST. CARILLO IN THE THE CONCERNS IS THE SUPPORT. BY. YES AND I KNOW THAT THE PROPONENTS DO NOT WISH TO FREE SCIENCE AND THAT SEEMS TO BE YOUR MAJOR CONCERN JUST SO I SUMMARIZED THE LAST -- A TWELVE MINUTES IN ABOUT ONE SENTENCE WE'RE NOT GOING TO FREE SCIENCE -- I KNOW THAT THAT'S TRUE ON BOTH SIDES AND YOU. YOU REALLY NEED TO COME TO SOME. I HOPE YOU CAN COME TO SOME AGREEMENT ON IT -- ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YES. MISC -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA THANK YOU -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE. FOR FOR A LONG TIME AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THE THAT WE DO HAVE AN END PRODUCT THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT -- AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE OPPOSITION IS WORKING TO GET TO A CONSENSUS THAT MAKES FAIR AND IS MOVING. OUT OF THEIR COMFORT ZONE I WOULD SAY THAT IN MY EXPERIENCE WITH OUR PRO TEM THAT SHE COMES AT THIS FROM A PRAGMATIC APPROACH AND TRIES TO FIND COMPROMISE AND TRACES OF GET TO THE BEST PLACE IN THAT IN THAT RESPECT I'M COMFORTABLE THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS. WILL CONTINUE. THAT'S MY ONLY CONCERN HAS BEEN AS WE WERE LOOKING AT THESE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT -- THAT WE WE RESPECT WHERE WERE AT AT THE BEGINNING OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT THAT WE ALLOW THAT FLEXIBILITY. MOVING FORWARD I IN THERE AND SO I JUST WANT TO ECHO THAT -- IT SOUNDS LIKE THE PROPONENTS ARE OPEN TO THOSE DISCUSSIONS TO CONTINUE THERE ARE OTHER SECTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE DISCUSSED -- AND PROBLEMS IN THIS BILL BUT I'VE SEEN THIS ENOUGH THAT THAT'S MY ONLY CONCERN ALSO I ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT -- WHILE YOU'RE NEGOTIATING ON OTHER STUFF A LOT OF WHAT YOU'RE NEGOTIATIONS THAT THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED NOW. FOR OVER A YEAR THAT IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT THAT WERE HERE AND SO I DON'T WANT TO RE OPEN OUR TAKES US OUT OPPORTUNITY TO REOPEN STUFF THAT WE HAVE CUT INTO AGREEMENT IN THE PAST AND I HOPE THAT. THAT WE ARE ALL -- DISCIPLINE THAT WAY AS WE MOVE FORWARD FORWARD WITH IT BUT THIS BILL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. POWER QUE HAN THANK YOU THERE -- I WANT TO START BY THINKING APPROACH HIM FOR BRINGING THIS BILL I THINK. WHAT WE NEED TO GET BACK TO IS REMEMBERING THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS PROTECTS OUR AIR OUR WATER AND OUR ENDANGERED SPECIES AND THAT'S? AS A STATE THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THOSE ARE VALUES THAT THIS BILL GOES A LONG WAY IN MAKING SURE THAT THOSE RESOURCES WHICH HAVE LONG BEEN PROTECTED REMAIN PROTECTED DESPITE. OTHERS USE THAT THE ENVIRONMENT DOESN'T NEED. EMERGENCY REGULATIONS THAT WHICH I I DO. AND YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN COMMENTS MADE ABOUT THE LACK OF NOTICE AND COMMENT I FIND THAT. LITTLE SURPRISING GIVEN THAT THE BILL VERY CLEARLY REQUIRES IN AND THAT THERE'S AT LEAST THIRTY DAYS. OF NOTICING COMMENTS BEFORE A VOTE IS TAKEN AGAIN. JUST ON REGULATIONS THAT ARE AS PROTECTIVE AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO I I SEE THIS AS CONTAINING THE NECESSARY NOTICE AND COMMENT THAT WAS REQUIRED UNDER LAW BUT I ALSO. THERE'S NO QUESTION I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AS WE HAVE AND SO -- WE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS -- BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES HERE THEY NEED TO BE PROTECTED AND WATER IS ONE OF THEM -- WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THE NECESSARY CLEAN WATER IN OUR STATE AND THE NEED TO PROTECT IT AND THIS GOES A LONG WAY IN DOING THAT AND IN SO DOING PROTECTS THE SPECIES THAT LIVE IN IT WHICH ARE EQUALLY AS VALUABLE SO. AND THANK YOU FOR THAT GOOD. ARE OUT I'LL GET TO YOU IN A MINUTE -- MR MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR ARAMBULA. AT A PRO TEM I FULLY SUPPORT. YOUR INTENT WITH HIS BILL AND AND SO OBVIOUSLY -- BUT OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE SOME. ISSUES THAT ARE BEING RAISED A FIRST AND FOREMOST IN MY MY CONCERN IS THE YOU KNOW WHY. I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO TALK WITH THE METROPOLITAN WATER WATER DISTRICT BUT I I KNOW THAT. TO THAT -- SO MANY PEOPLE AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RELY ON AND THE P. D. FOR OUR WATER AND SO -- I AS TO WHY YES -- AND SO I TRUST THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO RESOLVE THOSE -- THOSE CONCERNS -- IN TERMS OF THE EXPANDING THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION TO ENFORCE WHICH IN OUR LAW. DE DO YOU EIGHT MET AS CHARGE THEIR I I THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE ISSUES WE ARE RECENTLY WORKING ON IT MAY COME. TO SOME AGREEMENT ON IT WE HAVEN'T COME TO SUMMER WELL WE'RE WORKING ON IT I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I JUST HAD A CUT WELL. OKAY. OKAY -- I A I I REMAIN COMMITTED TO WORKING ON ANY AND ALL OF THESE ISSUES WE MAY AT THE END OF THE DAY COME TO A DISAGREEMENT OR A OR A I AGREE TO DISAGREE ON CERTAIN PIECES. BUT I AM COMMITTED -- IT I'M SURE THIS WILL COME UP AGAIN DURING THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE I WE WILL BE ACTIVELY STILL TRYING TO GET TO SOME. AGREEMENT ARE CLOSER -- BETWEEN NOW AND THEN. DEATH BUT WHAT BUT WE HAVE WE HAVE MADE SOME GROUND ON PIECES OF THE CONCERNED AND IN THAT AREA OKAY AND AS YOU'RE RESPONDING YEARS YOU'RE REMINDING ME THAT THAT MAY BE BEYOND THE THE THE THE PURVIEW OF THIS COMMITTEE AND BUT BUT BUT IT WILL COME IT WOULD. THERE WILL BE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO ADDRESS THAT AGAIN UNDERSTAND IN THAT IT IS ALSO YOUR CONCERN OKAY. AND THEN I I HEARD FROM THE OPPONENTS THAT -- THAT -- THE THERE SEEMS TO BE A A BASIC DISAGREEMENT WITH THIS THIRTY DAY NOTICE PERIOD AND AND AND FOR THE OPPONENTS WILL LET YOU -- GET INTO THAT DETAIL FIRST BUT LET'S FINISH WITH QUESTION AND THEN YOU CAN. THEN WE CAN HAVE BOTH SIDES RESPOND WELL I I WE HEARD FROM THE THE OPPOSITION AND SO I WANTED TO HEAR FROM. WE'LL GET TO THAT. OKAY WE HAVEN'T FULLY HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION WILL FULLY HEAR FROM THEM AS TO WHY THEY DON'T THINK IT'S ADEQUATE AND AND WE'LL HEAR FROM -- THE PROPONENTS -- ABOUT WHERE THEY WHERE THEY THINK THAT'S GOING OKAY ALL RIGHT I THREE CONCERNS ALL RIGHT WE'LL GET TO THAT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. RIGHT NOW -- I'D LIKE TO MAKE IT MOSTLY ABOUT THE ENDANGERED SPECIES. IF -- BUT WE WILL BE GETTING TO THE OTHER TOPICS. OKAY SO. LET'S GET TO THE NOTIFICATION. ABOUT THE THIRTY DAYS IN THE FIVE DAYS AND WELL I'M SORRY -- DOCTOR ARAMBULA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND YOU KNOW I'M WANTING TO GET INTO THE WEEDS A LITTLE BIT ON THE POLICY SPECIFICALLY REGARDING INCIDENTAL TAKES. YOU KNOW YOUR INITIAL COMMENT WAS TO INSULATE US FROM GOING BACKWARDS AND I APPRECIATE THAT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE ONE OF OUR ENDED UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AS WE CAN'T ADVANCE WITH THE BEST SCIENCE WE HAVE. AND SO I JUST HAVE CONCERNS AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE FACT. OF WHAT I THINK IS A FREEZE. NOW WE MADE TALK ABOUT AND DISAGREE ABOUT THAT BUT IT. SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE NOT TAKEN BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS GOING FORWARD THAT WE'VE FROZEN IN TIME. SCIENCE AND THE FALL MIDWATER TRAWLS THAT OCCURS REGARDING DELTA SMELT -- THERE ARE SOME NEWER TECHNOLOGIES THAT I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE A TURBIDITY BRIDGE THAT. MAY DEAL MORE WITH TIMING THAN IT DOES WITH ALL OR NONE. AND WHY AND BRING IN ALL OF THIS UP IS WATER MATTERS FOR COMMUNITIES AND HOW WE GROW AND HOW WE ENSURE WE HAVE ACCESS. TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER BUT THERE CO EQUAL GOALS. AND AS WERE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION. IT SOUNDS AS IF YOUR INTENT WAS NOT TO DISRUPT THE STATE WATER PROJECT. BUT I WANT TO ASK YOU DIRECTLY. WHAT A CURSE? IF THE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS ARE DIFFERENT. WILL THERE BE A DISRUPTION TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT. WELL A I WILL ASK HIM MAYBE TO RESPOND BUT NOT IN NOT IN TERMS OF THE INTENT OF THIS BILL WHICH IS WHY WE ADDED. THE PIECES ABOUT ACCORDING TO THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE. ARE THE IN TERMS OF THE VOLUNTARY WATER AGREEMENTS AND THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE RIGHT NOW. I I I THINK IT IS DIFFICULT AT BEST THE CONVERSATIONS IN NEGOTIATIONS I'M GLAD TO HEAR. ANA THAT SOME OF THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE GOING WELL IN TERMS OF THE DIRECTION WE'RE TRYING TO GO -- BUT NOT. DUE TO THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION WE ARE IT TRYING TO INCLUDE TO LEAVE THE FLEXIBILITY OUT WHETHER IT'S RELATED TO THE THE SCIENCE. OR AS ITS ROUTE RELATES TO THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT OUT WE WANT THE FLEXIBILITY WE DON'T WANT TO CUT OFF THE ABILITY TO HAVE BETTER STANDARDS OR ARE. BETTER AT TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE TO US WE JUST WHAT WE ARE OPERATING FROM A BASS. AND AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WILL GET TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCESS I KNOW. BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT -- AT WERE SETTING RULES OF ENGAGEMENT AND TRYING TO ALLOW FLEXIBILITY SO THAT WE'RE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE NEGOTIATIONS AS IT RELATES TO FULLY IMPLEMENTING. OUR WHAT WE HAVEN'T YET BEEN ABLE TO DO WERE STILL IN CONVERSATIONS ON MANY OF THESE VOLUNTARY. AGREEMENTS WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THERE WHICH IS WHY THEY'RE CONTINUING TO HAVE MEETING SO WE'VE TRIED TO PUT IN HERE AND I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY. OR A BIOLOGIST I AM A LAY PERSON THAT IS LOOKING A COMMON SENSE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE ARE NOT PRECLUDING I'VE BEEN ENGAGED IN THESE CONVERSATIONS SINCE WE DID THE WATER BOND. TOGETHER AT WITH ALL OF THE PARTIES TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE KEEPING OUR OPTIONS OPEN AND NOT FOR CLOSING OUR LOSING ANY OPPORTUNITIES WHEN IT IS ABOUT HOW WE ARE. TRYING TO GET MORE WATER ALL ACROSS OUR STATE AND THE BAY DELTA PLAN AND THE ISSUES ARE THERE. YOU KNOW WE'VE HAVE LONG DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE BAY AREA AND WE'RE NOT TRYING TO GET THIS BILL TO GET IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL OF THOSE LONG TERM DISCUSSIONS. WE ARE JUST SETTING BASELINE STANDARDS TO PROTECT WHAT WE HAVE IN PLACE. AND ALLOW THE FLEXIBILITY AND THE BEST SCIENCE AND A REVIEW PROCESS THAT DOESN'T START OVER. I WITH A YOU KNOW AND CREATE SOMETHING NEW FROM BASELINE STANDARDS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN SET. AND I DO WANT TO GET A RESPONSE FROM YOU IF I CANBECAUSE THERE REALLY IS THIS ISSUE BETWEEN STATE AND FEDERAL PROJECTS. RIGHT UNTIL VALLEY PROJECT IN THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND WHAT WE PASSED HERE DOESN'T APPLY TO THEM AND FRANKLY WHAT HAPPENS. TO THE WATER AT THE END OF THE DAY BECAUSE THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS. DON'T TAKE INTO A THIS BILL. AND IF PEOPLE. ENTER INTO A VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT AND WE'RE SAYING THAT FEDERAL POLICY. THERE ARE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS DON'T APPLY. AT SOME POINT WERE PUTTING THOSE TWO SYSTEMS IN CONFLICT. AND I'M STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT. TO UNDERSTAND HOW. TO METER CO EQUAL GOALS AT THE SAME TIME. KIM THE PRESIDENT PRO TEM IS ASK YOU TO RESPOND TO THAT OKAY SO -- SO WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW BE RESPECTIVE OF SENATE BILL ONE IS THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS IS GOING TO BE SHORTLY ISSUING NEW BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS -- FOR THE OPERATION OF THE FEDERAL WATER PROJECT -- THE STATE PREVIOUSLY HAS ISSUED WHAT THEY CALL A CONSISTENCY DETERMINATION OF UNDER THE STATE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT WHICH MEANS THE GENERALLY SPEAKING THE WAY THAT IN THE PAST. THEY'VE PRECEDED IS TOGETHER -- WHERE WHAT THE SPECIAL GOVERNMENT ISSUES IS THEIR BIOLOGICAL OPINION WE WILL NOW APPLY THE STATE WILL LOOK AT AND SAY WE BELIEVE THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH STATE? ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT THOUGH AND THEN THE AND THE PROJECTS WILL OPERATE UNDER. BASICALLY A JOINT SET OF RULES. BUT UNFORTUNATELY NOW THERE'S ON WHAT'S HAPPENED IS WITH THE NEW BIOLOGICAL PAINS COMING OUT AND THERE BEING SOME UNCERTAINTY. ABOUT. WELL I MEAN. I CAN'T PUT MY WORDS IN THE MOUTH OF D. W. R. DFW I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY THE REASON BUT D. W. R. HAS CHOSEN. TO NOT SEEK A CONSISTENCY DETERMINATION OF SU NOT ASK THE DEPARTMENT TO LOOK AT THE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS AND SAY YES THEY ARE INDEED CONSISTENT WITH STATE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT AND INSTEAD. THEY DECIDED TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE TO ISSUE ITS OWN STANDALONE OPINION -- BUT WHICH PARCHMENT DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WHILE NO NO FEDERALIST DAY THIS I'M SORRY SO WHEN I SAY DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WHILE I'VE I MEAN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. WHEN IS THE US FISH WILDLIFE SERVICE I MEAN A FEDERAL AGENCY SORRY -- SO -- SO THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW -- IF SB ONE WERE ENACTED. THE STATE SPECIES DIPPED THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS WE WOULD CONTINUE TO GO FORWARD WITH ITS PERMITTING PROCESS UNDER STATE LAW AND THE ONLY QUESTION WILL BE WHAT HAPPENS. WITH THOSE. THREE SPECIES THAT ARE FEDERALLY LISTED BUT NOT STATE LISTED WHICH ARE SOUTHERN RESIDENT ORCA NORTH AMERICAN GREEN STURGEON AND CENTRAL VALLEY STILL HEAD. AND THE DEPARTMENT WOULD NEED TO LOOK AT THE PREVIOUS PREVIOUS STANDARDS THAT WERE UNDER THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT OPINION AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO DECIDE WELL OR THOSE RULES GOOD EACH I MAKE CHANGES TO A WHAT IS THE SCIENCE SAY. NOT THAT'S HOW I'M INTERPRETING THE BILL THAT IS NOT HOW. THE CONTRACTORS ARE INTERPRETING THE BILL AND SO THERE IN LIES THE DISCUSSION THAT WE NEED TO HAVE AND I WOULD KNOW NIGHT IT HAS BEEN REFERENCED. THE SECRETARY CROWFOOT HAS -- ACTUALLY TODAY PULLED JENNIFER AND I ASIDE AND SAID THAT HE WOULD LIKE -- THE TO CONVENE THE WATER CONTRACTORS AND PROPONENTS OF SB ONE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION TO UNPACK THE VARIOUS ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE QUESTIONS YOU'RE RAISING. AND THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED HERE TODAY AND AGAIN AS PERTAINS. TO YOUR QUESTIONS THE QUESTIONS ON THE VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT THE APPLICATION OF THE CALIFORNIA DANGER SPECIES ACT TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT AND THOSE ARE DISCUSSION THAT WE WILL BE HAVING AND WE ARE OPEN TO TRY. TO FIGURE A WAY FORWARD BECAUSE AS I STATED BEFORE OUR INTENT IS NOT TO FREEZE. THIS IS A SCIENCE BECAUSE YOU POINTED TO THE FALL MIDWATER TRAWLS ISSUE AND THE THAT HAS BEEN CHANGED SINCE THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BIOLOGICAL OPINION OKAY I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN INTO THE WAY SORRY. NO IT WILL NOW GET OUT OF WE ALL RIGHT CHAIRMAN IF THERE WERE NO BILL THIS WOULD STILL BE AN ISSUE YEP. JUST RIGHT ABSOLUTELY ALL RIGHT I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN ABOUT AS FAR AS WE CAN IF YOU WANT TO TAKE ONE MINUTE TO SUMMARIZE OPPOSITION. YES WHERE DOES REMAIN REALLY CONCERNED WE WE THINK THERE'S ALREADY A STATE LOTTO DRESS STATE ENDANGERED SPECIES IF THERE'S ISSUES WITH THE FEDERAL PERMIT IT'S NOT REMOVING THE SPECIES FROM LISTING IT JUST MAY BE CHANGING THE CRITERIA. BASED ON BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS -- AND AND WE REMAIN OPPOSED UNTIL WE CAN ADDRESS THE ISSUE WHERE THIS BILL FILLED VERY TARGETED TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT SPECIFICALLY. ALL THIS AT ONE POINT THE THE BILL CREATES A STARED THAT SAYS. WHETHER THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS ARE MORE OR LESS PROTECTIVE IT'S AN UNDEFINED TERMS TO THE AGENCIES MAY USE THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE BUT THE BILL GIVES PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION SUCH THAT. CITIZENS CAN FORCE WHETHER THEY AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH WHAT'S MORE LESS PROTECTIVE AND THE ISSUE IS. THE AGENCIES WILL BE AT RISK OF BEING SUED EITHER WAY BECAUSE THIS BILL CREATES A NEW STANDARD AND FORCED BY CITIZENS AND THAT'S THE ISSUE IT DOESN'T STAY IN THE BILL IT FREEZES THAT. IT CREATES A LEGAL STANDARD WHICH BECAUSE YOUR PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FORCE MEANT. WILL ALLOW ME MAY NOT BE AN RTC OR MAY NOT BE YOU KNOW ANYONE HERE THE TABLE BUT IT ALLOWS ANYBODY ANY CITIZEN TO ENFORCE. WHAT THEY AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH WHAT'S MORE LESS PROTECTIVE AND THAT'S THAT'S REALLY THE ISSUE? ALL RIGHT I I THINK WE'VE WE'VE HEARD ENOUGH. DO YOU HAVE A FINAL STATEMENT ON THIS PARTICULAR AREA AND THEN WE'LL. WE'LL TRY AND GET THE NOW OKAY FINE I THINK WE'VE HEARD ENOUGH. THIS CLEARLY ARE GOES BEYOND -- WELL. LET'S HOPE THE SECRETARY CAN GET YOU BOTH TOGETHER. ALL RIGHT -- FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND TOXIC MATERIALS POINT OF VIEW THIS BILL IS GREAT -- I DO ONE HERE ON THE NOTICE QUESTIONS SO IF YOU COULD TAKE ONE MINUTE TO SAY WHY YOU WANT THE FIVE DAYS RATHER THAN THIRTY DAYS. AND THEN WE CAN GET TO ANY FINAL QUESTIONS SURE JUST TO CLARIFY THE RECORD THE BILL STRUCTURED SUCH THAT. THE AGENCIES ARE REVIEWING ON A QUARTERLY BASIS IF THERE'S A FEDERAL ROLE BACK IN THEIR DETERMINATION THEY PROMULGATE A LIST AND IT JUST SAYS THIS STANDARD IS MORE THEY BELIEVE IT'S MORE OR LESS PROTECTIVE. THE ACTUAL PROMULGATION OF RULE MAKING WHERE THEY FOLD IN COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL AND LABOR STANDARDS. STATUTES AND GUIDELINES INTO CALIFORNIA LAW THE ACTUAL FORMAL RULE MAKING PROCESS. IS UNDER TITLE ONE HUNDRED CHANGE WITHOUT REGULATORY AFFECT UNDER THIS BILL AND IT IS EXPRESSLY WAIVES UNDER DIVISION -- TO OR CHAPTER TWO SKEWS ME -- L. REVIEW ALL WE PROPOSED IS EMERGENCY ROOM MAKING FOR THE ACTUAL PROMULGATION OF THE RULE MAKING THE UPPER DOWN LIST OF WHETHER IT'S MORE LESS PROTECTIVE. IS NOT THE MEAT AND BONES OF WHAT THE AGENCIES WILL BE DOING THAT'S JUST WE THINK THIS IS MORE OR LESS PROTECTIVE. THE ACTUAL FOLDING OF THAT FEDERAL LAW INTO CALIFORNIA LAW IS DONE COMPLETELY IN THE DARK OR ASKING FOR EMERGENCY RULE MAKING UNDER A PA IT'S FIVE DAYS NOTICE AND COMMENT TEN A. O. L. REVIEWED JUST TO BE CLEAR. THAT'S NOT CURRENTLY IN THE BILL. ALL RIGHT. DO YOU WANT TO MAKE COMMENT ON THAT -- OR HAVE ONE OF YOUR EXPERTS HI I WILL ASK MR LOOK FOR A FEW WILL COMMENT ON THAT BECAUSE THIS IS BEEN. A GREAT DEAL OF DISCUSSION OKAY GO AHEAD MISS MILLER CHAIRMAN KIBLER PER THE PRO TEM'S OFFICE OUT TWO THINGS ONE IS I WANT TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE. THIS BILL IS. BLOCKING ARE PUTTING IN PLACE THE EXISTING FEDERAL BASELINE STANDARDS THAT HAVE EXISTED IN MANY CASES FOR DECADES AND BEEN THROUGH NOT JUST EXTENSIVE ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCESS. BUT ALSO LITIGATION AND SO THE PREMISE OF THE BILLS TO SAY WHERE THE AGENCY IS ADOPTING ESSENTIALLY THAT SAME STANDARD THAT HAS NOT BEEN CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY. AND IF YOU LOOK FOR EXAMPLE ON PAGE SEVEN LINES TWENTY FIVE THREE TWENTY SEVEN WHERE IT SAYS. IF THE FEDERAL BASELINE STANDARD AS ADOPTED WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL MODIFICATION THAN IT IS TRUE YOU GET A THIRTY DAY NOTICE AND YOU CAN COMMENT. THE I THINK THE OPPONENTS ARE -- CONFLATING THAT WITH A FULL BLOWN RULE MAKING IN OTHER WORDS AN AGENCY THAT IS INVENTING OR STARTING. IMPLEMENT A LAW AND SO THE IDEA HERE IS IF IT'S JUST SIMPLY PUTTING INTO REGULATION AN EXISTING FEDERAL BASELINE STANDARD THAT HAS EXISTED FOR A LONG TIME. THERE SHOULD BE A SHORTER PROCESS OTHERWISE YOU SET UP LITIGATION YOU SET UP DELAYS AS WE ALL KNOW THE RULE MAKING PROCESS CAN TAKE TIME. IF THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE HOWEVER THIS BILL PROVIDES THAT YOU WOULD GO THROUGH THE FULL ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE PROCESS THAT'S THE DISTINCTION HERE. OKAY THANK YOU -- PERHAPS WE COULD HAVE ONE MINUTE ON THE TROPHY QUESTION. AND THEN NOW A RESPONSE AND THEN HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET TO A VOTE ON THE BILL. AT WITH ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. DID YOU HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS MADAM VICE CHAIR. NOW. ARE YOU DO. ON THE ENDANGERED SPECIES PART OR I'M JUST HAVING TROUBLE FALLING. THE OBJECT HERE IS WORKING. WHEN THEY'RE DONE I WILL? FIND MY QUESTION [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR NOEL CREAMERS OF CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU. SO SECTION ONE OF THE BILL. WAS ADDED IN ITS TREATED DIFFERENTLY THAN THE REST OF THE BILL AND THAT IT DOESN'T SUNSET SO THIS IS A PERMANENT PROVISION. THAT. WAS DESCRIBED AS A WAY TO GET AT THE CONCERN ABOUT THE ROLE BACK AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR THE IMPORTATION OF TROPHY HUNTED WILDLIFE. AND BRINGING SO AN ELEPHANT THAT SKILLED IN AFRICA BACK INTO -- CALIFORNIA. THE ISSUE WITH THE LANGUAGE THOUGH IS THAT IT GIVES. THE AUTHORITY ESSENTIALLY TO EVERY OTHER STATE AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL ACTIONS IN CALIFORNIA. BY SAYING THAT IT IS PERHAPS IT TO TRANSPORT CELL RECEIVE ACQUIRE OR PURCHASE ANY FISH WILDLIFE OR PLANT TAKEN POSSESS TRANSPORTED OR SOLD IN VIOLATION OF ANY LAW OR REGULATION OF ANY OTHER STATE. OR FOREIGN LAW. SO THAT COULD MEAN THAT BECAUSE MASSACHUSETTS PROHIBITS. THE BRINGING OF FIRE WOOD INTO STATE PARKS THAT CALIFORNIA THEN YOU WOULD BE TRANSPORTING. BASED ON THE WAY SECTION ONE IS DESCRIBED IS THAT IT'S DEALING WITH. THE PREVENTION OF TROPHY HUNTING. WE BELIEVE THAT THAT SECTION NEEDS TO BE FOCUSED ON THE LAW THAT DEALS WITH TROPHY HUNTING AND SPECIFICALLY LIMITED TO HAVE THAT. RATHER THAN HAVING THESE BROADLY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES RESTRICTING ACTIVITIES IN CALIFORNIA JUST BECAUSE ANOTHER STATE HAS SET A DIFFERENT RULE OR A DIFFERENT STANDARD AND WE HAVE AN EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED THAT UNDER STATE LAW. ALL RIGHT AND THEN KIM. AND TRY TO MAKE IT TO MY WILL YES I WILL TRY TO BE BRIEF. SO -- SECTION A OF SECTION. ONE DOES DO WHAT. IT IS SPECIFIC TO THE IMPORTATION OF WILDLIFE AND IT IS FOR THE SPECIFICALLY TARGETED AT THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE FACING RIGHT NOW WHICH IS THIS CURRENT FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION ROLLED BACK RULES. THAT WOULD HAVE PROHIBITED THE IMPORTATION OF NOT JUST ELEPHANT PARTS BUT ALSO LINE PARTS. ON THAT IS THAT WOULD THAT WHAT WERE PREVIOUSLY PROHIBITED UNDER THE FOR THE PAST FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. THE SECOND SECTION SECTION BE WAS WRITTEN -- SIMILARLY WITH A SIMILAR INTENT BECAUSE IT'S REFERRING TO BOTH STATE AND INTERNET AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS SO IT'S THE WAY THE PROVISION WAS WRITTEN SO VERY SIMILAR TO THE FEDERAL LACEY ACT. WHICH ALL THAT BILL ALL THAT SECTION DOES IS IT'S TO ACQUIRE A CORD A RESPECT FOR THE LAWS OF OTHER STATES AND FOREIGN NATIONS. AND THAT YOU CANNOT ILLEGALLY BRING IN ILLEGALLY SOURCED PRODUCTS THAT SO THAT'S WHAT IT IS IT DOES IT'S NOT INTENDED AND AND IT TO SAY THAT MASSACHUSETTS LAW CERTAINLY APPLIES TO CALIFORNIA IT SIMPLY SAYS THAT. IF SOMETHING IS SOURCED IN MASSACHUSETTS ILLEGALLY UNDER MASS ILLEGALLY UNDER MASSACHUSETTS LAW YOU CANNOT BRING IT IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE'RE NOT HERE. TO UP WE KNOW OF PROMOTE VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAW. THAT'S THAT IS HOW IT'S BEEN READ UNDER THE FEDERAL LACEY ACT FOR YEARS AND DECADES AND DECADES WE ARE HAPPY TO MAKE WHATEVER CHANGES WE NEED TO TO THIS PROVISION TO MAKE THAT CLEAR. ON THAT IT IS A SOURCING ISSUE OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA VERSUS SOMEHOW DICTATING IN CHANGING CALIFORNIA LAW AND WE'VE ACTUALLY ASKED THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE'S GENERAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE. TO PROVIDE US WITH SOME LANGUAGE TO MAKE THAT CLEAR AND NOW THAT THEY FINALLY BEEN GIVEN THE GREEN LIGHT TO PROVIDE US WITH MORE THAN JUST TECHNICAL AN INFORMAL COMMENTS WE WILL BE MAKING THOSE CHANGES. THANK YOU. RIGHT TO THE PROTESTS OF COURSE. OF COURSE OF CUT MADAM. VICE CHAIR. YOU CAN ASK ANY QUESTION YOU WANT. I THINK YOU MADE AND CHAIRMAN. LET ME START OFF BY SAYING THAT -- HI. I THINK MISTER CHAIRMAN WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS KEEP THE KEEP THE HEARING FOR THIS BILL WHICH IS VERY COMPLICATED ORGANIZED AND KEEP EVERYBODY ON TASK AND I APPRECIATE THAT IT JUST. DEFINITELY THREW ME OFF WITH THAT WHERE WE WERE GOING TO MAKE THAT IS -- CERTAINLY. YOUR PREROGATIVE TO DO SO AND I I FOLLOWED ALONG AS BEST I COULD -- THERE A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN ASKED AND ANSWERED -- SO. I JUST. I GUESS MY ONLY QUESTION AT THIS POINT IS. HOW MANY -- AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO THIS POINT SINCE IT'S BEEN GREAT THANK. THREE THREE TWO EIGHT FOUR IF YOU CAN APPROPRIATIONS ON THE SENATE SIDE. SO HOW MANY AMENDMENTS SO FAR HAVE BEEN TAKEN. HERE'S A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS YEAH OVER TWENTY TWENTY OKAY AND WE TAKE IN. TRYING TO SEE BY. SO TWENTY AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE STOLEN OFF A LOT OF OPPOSITION -- ARE YOU HOPEFUL THAT. YOU ARE GOING TO COME TO SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT WHERE EVERYONE IS SATISFIED OR AT LEAST SOME. LEVEL OF COMFORT IS ACHIEVED ON BOTH SIDES BECAUSE THIS IS A BIG ISSUE -- AND ENNIS AND BEFORE YOU ANSWER THAT LET ME JUST SAY THAT -- YOU KNOW I THINK TYPICALLY -- PERHAPS THOSE ON YOUR SIDE OF THE AISLE DON'T FEEL THAT -- THOSE ON MY SIDE OF THE AISLE ARE NECESSARILY -- PERHAPS WE COULD. THIS IS NOT WHAT WHAT WHAT WE ALL RESPECT TO HONEST. WE DO. ON THIS IS NOT NO I KNOW APPRECIATE THAT IS A NOTHING TO DO WITH RESPECT I'M OLD I'M JUST TRYING TO POINT OUT SOME. SOME DIFFERENCES THAT I THINK ARE OBVIOUS TO EVERYONE THIS IT'S NOT A COMBATIVE OKAY CONVERSATION SO -- I THINK THAT WE HAVE GROWN USED -- TO HAVING VERY DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT ISSUES LIKE THIS BUT WHEN IN FACT WE ARE -- A LOT OF TIMES IN ALIGNMENT WITH ONE ANOTHER AND ON MANY OF THESE ISSUES PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES -- TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA SINCE WE ARE. WERE OWN ANIMAL HERE RIGHT IN THIS IN THIS COUNTRY BUT I HAVE GREAT CONCERN. THE AMOUNT OF OPPOSITION THAT STILL EXISTS GIVEN THAT THERE'S BEEN TWENTY AMENDMENTS AND GIVEN THAT THERE'S BEEN FOR COMMITTEE HAS I JUST WANTED TO HEAR FROM YOU. DIRECTLY -- WHAT KIND YOUR OUTLOOK IS FOR THIS AS IT GOES THROUGH AT LEAST TWO MORE HEARINGS M. IN THE ASSEMBLY? THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR -- AT YOU KNOW I I KNEW WHEN I TOOK ON THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT. BECAUSE IT INCLUDES A NUMBER OF IT DISTINCT ISSUES CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER. AS YOU SAW EVIDENCE HERE TODAY -- WE'RE WE'RE STILL HAVING ISSUES BETWEEN THE FEDERAL WATER PROJECT AND STATE WATER PRICE WE HAVE HAVE ALWAYS HAD THOSE ISSUES SO. THIS BILL IS NOT INTENDED TO ADDRESS THE EXISTING DIALOGUE THAT HAS GONE ON FOR THE WHOLE TIME THAT WE HAVE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE AND EVEN BEFORE -- THAT YOU KNOW I HAVE TO TRUST MY ANA. REPUTATION RECORD OF TRYING TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER I THINK THE REASON YOU HAVE -- INDIVIDUALS GETTING INTO THE WEEDS HERE IS BECAUSE WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME DOING THAT AND WE ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT ON A NUMBER OF THINGS. BUT WE HAVE MOVED ON QUITE A LOT OF THINGS. I THINK THAT PART OF THE AND TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST AS I KNOW YOU ALWAYS ARE. A LOT OF THE ISSUES HERE -- STEM ON THE FACT THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE THESE THINGS ROLLED BACK BECAUSE IT IS THE IT YOU KNOW IT TOOK A LOT TO GET THESE OUT LAWS AND REGULATIONS INTO PLACE TO BEGIN WITH. AND TO FRANKLY HAVEN'T AN ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON THAT IS SEEKING TO UNDO SOME OF THOSE THINGS THAT IS THE CRUX. OF IT AND I WANT TO AVOID ALL OF THAT I'M I DON'T CALL THIS INSURANCE SOME PEOPLE DO. I CALL THIS A PRESERVATION OF WHAT CALIFORNIANS HAVE SUPPORTED AND PUT INTO PLACE AND THAT'S WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP IN PLACE. I ALLOWING. FOR THE BEST POSSIBLE SCIENCE ARE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT FOR CLOSING OPPORTUNITIES. I UNDERSTAND HOW IT FEELS TO BE HERE AND HAVE THESE DISTINCT. OF POSITIONS -- BUT I WILL JUST HAVE TO GO ON THE THE BELIEF THAT I HAVE THAT WE CAN GET AS CLOSE AS WE POSSIBLY CAN WE WILL NOT TAKE ALL THE OPPOSITION OFF. I HEAR THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OUR AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS HERE THAT ARE MOSTLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE WATER. PIECES ARE I WOULD EXPECT NO LESS GIVEN WHAT WE'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH IN THE STATE. FROM NORTH TO SOUTH EAST TO WEST CENTRAL SO I WILL DO MY VERY BEST VICE CHAIRMAN. VICE CHAIRWOMAN BUT I WE MAY NOT GET THERE BUT IT WON'T BE FOR LACK OF TRYING. CAN I TAKE THAT ISSUE CLOTHES YES -- GOOD -- WAIT I'M SORRY MR MATHIS. EVEN AS OF TOMORROW AT APPROACH AND THAT IS A GREAT CLOSE. OF MY CONCERNS ARE JUST. WITH THE BROAD SWEEPING APPROACH. WITH EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE ENDANGERED SPECIES AND EVERYTHING ELSE I MEAN THIS IS CALIFORNIA WE'VE NEVER BEEN SHY ABOUT PASSING LAWS. SO WHY TAKE THE BROADER APPROACH WAYNE IF THE ADMINISTRATION WAS TO DO SOMETHING OR IF. THEIR BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS CHANGE THEN WE COULD ACT WITH URGENCY. VERSUS DOING SUCH A BROAD. BASED APPROACH IN RAISING ALL THE CONCERNS AND ALL THE RED FLAGS AND OF HAPPENED. I I AND I KNOW WE'VE DONE SEVERALTHINGS BEFORE WHERE WE CAN DO AN URGENCY BILL. AND GET IT THROUGH VERY QUICKLY IF THERE WAS SOMETHING TO HAPPEN. AND I UNDERSTAND TRYING TO GET AHEAD OF IT. BLOOD I MEAN THAT'S JUST KIND OF MY CONCERN ON ON WHY YOU'RE TAKING ON SUCH A TASK WHEN WE HAVE THE ABILITY -- AND ARE LEGISLATIVE BODY HERE'S NEVER BEEN SHY ABOUT IT. I I WOULD SAY IT IS A BROAD BILL BECAUSE WE'RE DEALING WITH MULTIPLE ISSUES. CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER AND I HIT WORKER PROTECTIONS -- IT IS NOT BROAD IN TERMS OF OF US TRYING TO BROADEN THE LAW SPECIFICALLY WE ARE TRYING. TO OF THAT TO BASICALLY CODIFIED THE BASELINE AND ALLOW FOR FLEXIBILITY SO THAT WE ARE NOT HEMMING OURSELVES IN. AND AND BASICALLY BOX IN OURSELVES INTO A CORNER I IN THIS IS A BIG BILL BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF ITEMS -- AREAS WITHIN IT BUT AS IT RELATES -- TO EACH SPECIFIC ONE IT ISN'T BROAD WERE BASICALLY JUST TRYING TO SET. AND CODIFIED IN STATUTE THE BASELINE PROTECTIONS THAT WE WORK FOR DECADES TO PUT INTO PLACE. DID I MISS THAT IS TO LOOK AT MY EXPERTS OF SORRY HOW ABOUT THAT ISSUE CLOSE. I'M HAPPY TO GO AYE I KNOW YOU HAVE OTHER BILLS. MISTER CHAIRMAN. AND I'M SORRY SHAPE THE TIME FROM YOU THE VICE CHAIRWOMAN AND MEDIA.

I GOT DIDN'T COLLEAGUES I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT SENATE BILL SIX FOUR SEVEN THE SAFE YOU'LL REACT. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE -- FOR THEIR COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS PLUS THE VISUAL AIDS THAT WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE. I WAS A COMMITTEE CONSULTANT SO MANY YEARS AGO WOULD HALF ON CAMERA SO IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME TO PUT PICTURES AN ANALYSIS SO I TIP MY HAT TO YOU. ALL AND I ACCEPT THE MEMBERS PROPOSED ON PAGE -- TEN SB SIX FOUR SEVEN UPDATES CALIFORNIA'S METAL CONTAINING YOU'LL RELY TO BETTER REFLECT THE CURRENT AND WIDELY ACCEPTED SCIENCE ON THE TOXICITY. OF LEAD AND CADMIUM IN JEWELRY. THE BILL DOES THE FOLLOWING FOUR THINGS THAT ADOPTS THE FEDERAL STANDARD FOR LEAD IN CHILDREN'S JEWELRY WHICH IS ONE HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION. ESTABLISHES THE CADMIUM STAND FOR CHILDREN YOUR PURSUANT TO THE A. S. T. M. INTERNATIONAL STANDARD WHICH IS LESS THAN SEVENTY FIVE PARTS PER MILLION. AND AMEND THE DEFINITION OF THE CHILDREN OF CHILDREN'S JEWELRY TO CONFORM WITH CANADA'S DEFINITION WHICH IS FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER. AND LASTLY APPLIES THE EUROPEAN UNION LEGIBLY STANDARD OF LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION TO ADULT YORI. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT UPDATE THE CALIFORNIA'S METAL CONTAINING JEWELLERY LAW IN ORDER TO PROTECT CHILDREN AND WOMEN FROM THE HARMFUL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH LEAD IN CADMIUM. I KNOW THERE'S SOME OPPOSITION I WILL -- HOLD ON TO MY REBUTTAL TO OPPOSITION I THINK THAT WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND AND JUST SAY THAT WITH ME TODAY REPRESENTING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WHO THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL IS MORRELL -- DIBERNARDO AND SUSAN LITTLE WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME'S MARIO DE BERNARDO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HABIA Và SERRA WHO'S PROUD TO SPONSOR THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT CHILDREN LIKE PLAYING AND WEARING JEWELRY DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S CHILDREN'S JEWELRY OR DAHLE JEWELERY -- AND WE KNOW THAT LEAD EXPOSURE TO BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS BUT ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN -- HAVE SOME SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES AND AND THEY'RE WELL DOCUMENTED IN SCIENCE. THIS IS WHY -- CALIFORNIA INITIALLY ESTABLISH ITS CHILDREN'S AND DAHLE JEWELRY STANDARDS BACK -- DECK OVER A DECADE AGO AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOLLOWED SUIT SEVERAL OTHER STATES HAVE CANADA. AND THE EUROPEAN UNION. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT CODIFIES MANY OF THE STANDARDS THAT ARE STRICTER THAN CALIFORNIA STANDARDS THAT WERE ADOPTED SUBSEQUENTLY BY E. YOU BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND CANADA? AND AS WE'VE SEEN THOSE HAVE BEEN IN EFFECT FOR SEVERAL YEARS IN THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN ABLE TO ADAPT TO THEM SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE THESE ARE REASONABLE STANDARDS. SO WITH THAT WE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND WE WANT TO THANK THE THE WORK DILIGENT WORK OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU I'M SUSAN LITTLE ON WHAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL. AND I JUST WANTED -- TO REITERATE AGAIN THAT AS WE ALL KNOW THE LEGISLATURE'S DONE A LOT OF WORK OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND REDUCING CHILDREN'S EXPOSURE TO LEAD. AND TRYING TO IDENTIFY CHILDREN WHO BEEN LET EXPOSED -- THIS CONCERN HAS BEEN PRIMARY HAS BEEN IN LARGE PART FUELED BY THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL'S ASSERTION. THAT THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL OF LEAD IN CHILDREN'S BLOOD. AND WE OF COURSE KNOW WITHOUT GETTING TO ADD INTO ALL THE DETAILS ABOUT LEAD EXPOSURE WHICH WERE VERY FAMILIAR WITH AT THIS POINT. JUST TO REMIND FOLKS THAT -- LEAD CAN AFFECT NEARLY EVERY SYSTEM IN THE BODY AND EVEN JUST A LITTLE BIT OF LEAD CAN AFFECT A CHILD'S AUG I Q.. AND FRIENDS FOR INSTANCE THE CAT AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS ATTRIBUTES ONE IN FIVE CASES OF CHILDHOOD ADHD. TO LEAD EXPOSURE AND WE DO KNOW THAT LEADS DAMAGE IS IRREVERSIBLE. CADMIUM OF COURSE TO HAVE A HOST OF HEALTH EFFECTS AND CAN DAMAGE MANY ORGANS IN THE BODY SO IT'S NOT A SURPRISE. THAT DPH CONTINUES TO WARN PARENTS AGAINST -- LETTING CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO JEWELRY BECAUSE IT IS A SOURCE OF LEAD EXPOSURE. AND ALSO IT INSTRUCTS DOCTORS TO USE ACCESS TO JEWELRY AS A RISK FACTOR WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT TO TEST CHILDREN. FOR TO BLOOD TEST CHILDREN FOR LEAD EXPOSURE -- ALONG THESE LINES JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT. WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE STANDARDS OF THIS BILL ARE. REASONABLE THAT CAN BE CUT THAT THEY CAN BE THE INDUSTRY CAN COMPLY WITH THEM BECAUSE RECENT TESTS BY THE OTHER CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL THE CENTERS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF JEWELRY PIECES SOLD IN CALIFORNIA AT LEAST OF THE OF THE HUNDREDS THAT WERE TESTED. COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL -- AND SO AGAIN WE JUST LIKE. TO ASK FOR THE COMMITTEES SUPPORT FOR THE BILL AND ON A LOT BECAUSE THIS IS ONE ONE OF THEM THIS WILL PROVIDE A CRUCIAL STEP TOWARD ELIMINATING LEAD IN THE HOME. THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT. CHEN MEMBERS NIKITA CRIED WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL HERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. HELLO ANDREA MENTOR WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION IN SUPPORT. NATALIE NEXT BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS IN SUPPORT. LAUREN COMMERCE HERE CLUB CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. JUST MONTHLY ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ADMINISTRATORS IN SUPPORT.

YES MISTER MURATSUCHI AT SO WE'LL GO TO QUESTIONS NOW. LISTINGS YUJI THANK YOU SIR FOR A BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I ACTUALLY. WANTED TO DO THIS BILL AS A FATHER OF A TEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER -- AND I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING GO ALL THE NEWS ABOUT LEADING CADMIUM IN. IN -- ESPECIALLY CHILDREN'S CHAUDHRY OVER THE YEARS AND SO -- I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU CAN ADD ME AS A CO AUTHOR I'LL BE HAPPY. SO I CAN NOW TELL MY DAUGHTER DID SOMETHING WORTHWHILE ABSOLUTE -- NOW IN THAT SHE'S ABOUT THE INTER HER TWEENER STATE I DON'T KNOW THIS WILL BE ENOUGH TO CONVINCE HER BUT A LOT OF THAT FILM POP MY BUBBLE -- BUT IT I I WANT TO ASK A MS LITTLE YOU KNOW -- I MEAN CLEARLY THIS BILL HAS. BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND IT IT SHOWS THAT THE THAT THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM IS INSUFFICIENT. TO TO ADDRESS -- YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE A LEAD IN JEWELRY YOU KNOW YOU WE WE WOULD THINK THAT -- MAYBE -- WE SHOULD BE BANNING LEAD AND COSMETICS ALSO BUT COULD YOU TALK ABOUT -- OUT WHY THE GREEN CHEMISTRY A PROGRAM IS INADEQUATE TO ADDRESS THE THE CONCERNS AND AND NOW IN JEWELRY IN THIS CASE. SURE WELL I THINK AT THIS POINT -- THE THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM OFFERS A LOT OF BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIA IN THAT IT ALLOWS. ESTABLISH THE PROGRAM WHERE WE PRODUCTS CAN BE TAKEN UP AND REVIEWED AND AND HAZARDOUS INGREDIENTS IDENTIFIED WITHIN THEM. HOWEVER WE KNOW THAT THERE IS JUST A SLEW OF HAZARDOUS INGREDIENTS IN MANY MANY DIFFERENT CONSUMER PRODUCTS. AND LEAD IS ONE EXAMPLE OF AN INGREDIENT THAT. THERE'S UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS CONSENSUS THAT. IT'S HARMFUL. IT'S THE IT'S A FAX TO REFUTE HERBAL. AND SO -- AND AND YET. OUR ABILITY TO TACKLE THAT IS IS IS LIMITED -- GIVEN THAT THERE ARE THERE IS SO MUCH WORK FOR THAT DEPARTMENT TO DO WHEN THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE TYPE OF LEGISLATION THE LEGISLATURE CANDY WAS STEPPING FORWARD. AND LIMITING THOSE TOXIC INGREDIENTS AND PRODUCTS WHERE THERE IS CONSENSUS AROUND THEIR HARMFUL AFFECTS ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU. YES IT'LL SAY VERY MUCH AGREE WITH YOUR COMMENT THEY'RE NEVER GONNA LOOK AT LEADING GREEN CHEMISTRY. JUST NOT NECESSARY SO WHEN THERE'S A CONSENSUS THERE'S A CONSENSUS MR MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IT'S NOT TOO OFTEN I ALIGN MY COMMENTS WITH THE MY COLLEAGUE. MISTER MURATSUCHI -- BUT AS A PROUD FATHER OF A FOUR YEAR OLD LITTLE GIRL -- I WOULD ACTUALLY LOVE TO ONE OF MR MURATSUCHI AND I'D LOVE TO BE A PRINCIPAL COOPER HAVE. AND INCLUDED THE BIPARTISANSHIP. WELL SENATOR HAPPY TO HAVE YOU JOIN ON THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR INTEREST HAPPY [inaudible] TO YES THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAUER K. HIM. WELL I APPRECIATE THAT MY COLLEAGUES ARE PAYING ATTENTION. TO MY DAUGHTER PUTS HER NECKLACES AND HER MOUTH ALL THE TIME AND EVERY TIME I THINK DON'T DO THAT DON'T DO THAT SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS BILL BECAUSE I SEE EVERYDAY THAT GOD KNOWS WHAT'S IN THEM AT ALL. SO BUT I AM AND IT'S IT'S INCREDIBLY CRAFTED BILL AS WELL I THINK THAT I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IT DOES IS REALLY BRING US IN LINE WITH OTHER -- JURISDICTIONS AND SO THERE'S NO REASON THAT INDUSTRY CAN'T DO THAT THEY'RE DOING IT ELSEWHERE SO LET'S HAVE THEM DO IT HERE SO THANK YOU FOR DOING SUCH A GREAT JOB OF WRITING THE BELL AND MAYBE A SHASTA JONT AUTHORED ONE UP MISTER MATHIS. RIGHT. ALL RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT SO -- CONCLUSION IS THIS IS A POPULAR BILL CLEARLY MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS ITEM NUMBER SIX SB SIX FORTY SEVEN MITCHELL.

DO THESE AMENDMENTS ABSOLUTE EXCELLENT JUST LET US KNOW WHICH ONE IS PRINCIPLE. I'LL WAIT TO HAVE THE FINAL VOTE BEFORE WE HAVE THAT CONVERSATION ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. US SENATOR CABALLERO PLEASE COME UP [inaudible] THE BILL [inaudible] SECOND [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. SENATOR CAFIERO IS PRESENTING SB THREE ONE SEVEN HAZARDOUS WASTE WASTE FACILITIES PROHIBITED CHEMICALS. AND I'VE LEARNED A LOT FINDING OUT ABOUT THIS BILL PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS -- THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT SB THREE SEVENTEEN WHICH WOULD BAN THE SALE OF TOXIC CHEMICALS USED IN RV WASTE WATER TANKS THIS ISSUE CAME. TO MY ATTENTION -- AT A NUMBER OF US HAD -- LOCAL RV PARKS IN IN OUR DISTRICT AND ONE OF THEM WAS CITED BY THE WATER BOARD -- FOR FOR THE THE FACT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THEIR TANKS TESTED HIGH FOR FORMALDEHYDE IN THE TANK AND WHAT WE DISCOVERED IS PART OF THE RESEARCH IS THAT -- RV'S USE THIS CHEMICAL COMPONENT IN THERE ARE V. TANKS SO THAT THAT THEY THE SO THAT THEY DON'T SMELL. AND WHAT IT DOES IS IT BREAKS UP THE THAT THE CHEMICAL DECOMPOSITION OF THE WASTE WATER AND SO WHEN THEY DUMP THEM INTO THE RV PARKS -- WHO ARE ALL ON SEPTIC TANKS -- THERE THIS CHEMICAL STOPS THE CHEMICAL. IN THE R. V. TANKS IT'S USED TO BREAK DOWN THAT THAT THE SEWAGE AND TO BE ABLE TO TO PULL THE WATER OUT IN THE END LEAVE THIS LIFE BEHIND SO -- BUT WHAT WE DISCOVERED IS IT THE SAME COMPANIES THAT MAKE THIS TOXIC CHEMICAL ALSO MAKE A GREEN. PRODUCT AS WELL WHICH WOULD SOLVE THE WHOLE PROBLEM AND SO -- THIS BILL WOULD BAN THE USE OF THESE TOXIC CHEMICALS IN OUR V. TANKS WHICH WOULD THEN SAVE US. FROM THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE WATER BOARD WILL COME IN AND SITE OUR RV PARK OWNERS THAT ARE ALL SMALL BUSINESSES THAT REALLY DON'T HAVE VERY MUCH MONEY -- AND SAVE THEM FROM THE NECESSITY OF HAVING TO FIX THEIR THAT. THEIR TANKS WHICH BECOME. CONTAMINATED BY THESE TOXIC PRODUCTS SO -- WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS CHASE AND I COULD WITH THAT'LL STEAM GILBERT ROPES AND SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF RV PARKS AND CAMPGROUNDS. WE ARE THE PROUD SPONSORS OF SB THREE SEVENTEEN WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR CARRYING IT AND THANK YOURSELF AND YOUR STAFF FOR FOR ALL THE TIME THEY PUT INTO THIS BILL -- IT GIVEN THE ENTHUSIASTIC MOTION WE HAVE AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAD A A REALLY LONG LONG DISCUSSION ON SB ONE SO I'M GONNA I'M TRYING TO MAKE IT VERY QUICK. SO IN SHORT THIS IS A BILL THAT WILL ADDRESS A MULTI DECADE ISSUE FOR THE PRIVATELY OWNED RV PARK AND CAMPGROUND INDUSTRY AS THE SENATOR SAID. THESE ARE MOSTLY SMALL BUSINESSES THE PRODUCTS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BANNING IN THIS BILL ARE BY -- SITES THAT ARE OFTEN USING TOXIC CHEMICALS. TO KILL BACTERIA AS THE SENATOR SAID THEY DO THE SAME THING IN OUR SEPTIC TANKS. IT CREATES A THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE GROUND WATER AND TO THE ENVIRONMENT -- SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE RIGHT APPROACH IS TO BAN THESE PRODUCTS THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH ADVISERS FROM THE US EPA THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA -- STUDIES FROM HARVARD -- AND AT ADVISORY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SINCE ABSENCES CONTROL SO VERY HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST TRAVEL THANK YOU THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. FOREIGN COMMISSAIRE CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT ANY OPPOSITION THAT'S NICE -- ALL RIGHT QUESTIONS. IT'S A GOOD BILL I HEARD THAT AND IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. IS THERE IT THIS ANY NO NO QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT I THINK WE CAN PROCEED WITH CALLING THE ROLL MADAM SECRETARY. THIS IS ITEM NUMBER FOUR SB THREE SEVENTEEN GUY YET ALL. THE MOTION IS DO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS QUIRK. AYE QUIRK AYE MELENDEZ. MELENDEZ AYE ARAMBULA. ARAMBULA HI POWER QUE HAN. ERA CAN I CRISTINA GARCIA. HOLDEN. HOLDEN I MATHIS. MATHIS I WANNA TO GI WITH A TO GI. SO THAT SEVEN ZERO SETS OUT GRADUATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SET SENATOR. ALL RIGHT -- WE'RE WAITING FOR MR HERTZBERG MISTER ALAN RESEARCH. THIS IS ON SB SIX FORTY SEVEN THE VOTE STANDS AT SIX ZERO ARAMBULA. ARAMBULA BRINGS IT TO SEVEN ZERO THANK YOU THAT MEANS [inaudible] AND YEAH [inaudible] ONE THIS. ONE YES SENATOR HERTZBERG VERY NICE TO SEE YOU. SO SENATOR HERTZBERG IS GOING TO PRESENT ON S. B. TWO OH FIVE BUSINESS LICENSES STORM WATER DISCHARGE COMPLIANCE. PROCEED WHEN READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS WE DON'T. ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH OF LATE. LAST THIRTY YEARS AND SO. HAS BUSINESS THIS CHARGE OF MOVEMENTS. OF THE MANY POINTS SOURCING GUIDE STATES -- INTO OUR NATIONAL WATER. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAME UP WITH THE PROCESS HIGH CALLED THE NPDES PERMIT UNDER THE FEDERAL CLEAN WATER ACT THE NATIONAL POLLUTANT DISCHARGE. ELIMINATION SYSTEM. THAT SYSTEM IS REYES IS INTEGRATED INTO OUR STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD WILL WE REQUIRE WHAT'S CALLED INDUSTRIAL GENERAL PERMIT. AND WE HAVE BEEN FACING THIS IN WHERE I COME FROM IN LOS ANGELES% COUNTY WE JUST PASSED A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR. A PARTIAL TAX TO BE ABLE TO RELIEVE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS OF THEIR LIABILITY FOR DISH CHARGE. ON THE CITY'S -- AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE LIABLE AND SO WHAT WE'VE COME UP WITH THIS BILL IS A PRETTY ELEGANT SOLUTION IN MY JUDGMENT. AND WE'RE GET LITTLE BIT A BELLY ACHING WHICH YOU ALWAYS GET WHEN YOU GOT A GOOD IDEA IN MY ARIENS. IS IS INNOCENCE THE WAY THIS LAW WORKS IS IT PENALIZES PEOPLE WHO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. IF YOU OF A HUNDRED ENTITIES THAT ARE POLLUTING IN DISCHARGING AND ONLY FIFTY OF THEM IN. IN IN MAINE IN THE IN THE CITY ARE ACTUALLY HAVE PERMITS THE BURDEN FALLS ON THE REMAINING ON THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE PERMITS TO DO THE CLEAN UP. SO YOU'RE YOU'RE TAKEN PEOPLE WHO ARE COMPLYING WITH THE LAW AND PUTTING IN AN ORDINANCE BURDEN ON THEM FOR POLLUTERS THAT DON'T COMPLY. AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE THIS EXTRAORDINARY BURDEN ON CITIES THAT GAVE THEM INDIGESTION BECAUSE THERE'S THIS THIS CHARGE OF WATER INTO THE SYSTEM. THAT DOESN'T MEET THOSE THE STANDARDS AND THEY'RE SUBJECT TO EXTRAORDINARY A LIABILITY THAT'S WHY THEY PUSHED SO HARD FOR THIS PARTIAL TAX MEASURE W. IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IN THIS BILL IS WE HAVE. GONE TO THE CITIES AND SAID LOOK WHEN YOU GET IT WHEN YOU GET IT A BUSINESS LICENSE YOU JUST GOT. TO PUT YOUR NUMBER DO YOU HAVE A PERMIT OR NOT IF YOU DO PUT THE NUMBER IN. AND THE CITY'S YOU'RE GONNA HEAR HIM COMPLAIN BECAUSE THAT WE'RE REQUIRING THEM TO CHECK IT OUT. OKAY WERE REQUIRED TO CHECK IT OUT BUT IF WHEN THEY DON'T DO WHAT THEY'RE DOING ONE THING THEY'RE TREATING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMPLYING WITH THE LAW IN A HORRIBLE WAY IN THEIR CITIES. AND SECONDLY THERE EXPOSING THEIR TAXPAYERS TO UNBELIEVABLE FINES FOR THEIR FAILURE TO DO THAT SO YES IS A LITTLE BIT OF BURDEN FOR THEM TO GO AND LOOK UP ON THE WEBSITE. TO SEE WHETHER THESE PEOPLE HAVE A PERMIT OR NOT IS THAT SIMPLE ENOUGH YEAH DO YOU WANT YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE OH GOD IT'S ANOTHER REQUIREMENT. BUT I WOULD SUGGEST ON LIKE OTHER AREAS OF THE LAW THAT WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH IN MANY CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS AN AREA OF THE LAW WHERE THE ASK IS SO SMALL. AND THE BENEFIT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE COMPLYING WITH THE LAWS AND ALSO THE BENEFIT TO TAXPAYERS IS SO HUGE. YOU KNOW IN THE MY DAD USED TO SAY IN THE OLD DAYS IN LATIN DIMINISH NOT CURE AT LEX THE LAW DOES NOT DEAL WITH TRIFLES AND THAT THIS IS OPPOSITION IS A TRIFLE I THINK IT'S A REALLY. ELEGANT SOLUTION THAT CAME TO ME BY THE SPONSORS AND THAT'S WHY I TOOK IT UP AND ASK YOUR RIVAL. GO AHEAD. AGOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME SEAN BUFFALO I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR A CALIFORNIA COAST KEY POINTS. OF THE SENATOR SAID EVERYTHING GREAT SO I'M GOING TO MAKE A FEW CLARIFICATIONS GIVE A LITTLE DETAIL ABOUT HOW THIS BILL REALLY DOES HELP MUNICIPALITIES. OF AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO THE REGULATED COMMUNITY TO GIVE THEIR THEIR TESTIMONY -- TWO CLARIFICATIONS ONE THERE WAS A CONFUSION WHEN THIS BILL WAS VERY FIRST INTRODUCED THAT THE MUNICIPALITIES WERE REQUIRED TO DETERMINE COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACTUAL PERMIT ITSELF SO THE WATER QUALITY STANDARDS WITH IN THE PERMIT. THE PERMIT TERMS THAT IS NOT THE INTENT OF THE BILL THAT'S NOT WHAT THE BILL SAYS TO DO. THE THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS TO SIMPLY INSURE THAT THE INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES THAT ARE SEEKING A BUSINESS LICENSE ARE IN ROLLED UNDER THE PERMIT THAT'S IT. AND AS THE SENATOR SAID ALL THAT ENTAILS IN THE WAY WE DESCRIBED TO BE TAKEN SEVERAL AMENDMENTS TO A CLARIFY BUT BE ALSO STREAMLINED THE PROCESS. IS TO TAKE A FOUR DIGIT AS I SEE CODE THAT I WON THOSE THAT'S ON THE APPLICATION AND COMPARE IT -- TO THE STATE WATER BOARDS WEBS WEB PAGE THAT THEY ACTUALLY CREATED JUST FOR THIS BILL -- SO THAT'S THAT'S THE INTENT OF IT SECOND -- UNDER MUNICIPAL STORM WATER PERMITS TO NOT THE INDUSTRIAL STORMWATER PERMIT BUT THE MUNICIPAL ONE THAT -- CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE UNDER THEIR ALREADY OBLIGATED TO DO THIS IS ACTUALLY NOT AS PRESCRIPTIVE IS THROUGH THE BUSINESS LICENSE EVEN THOUGH THAT'S GIVEN AS AN EXAMPLE -- BUT THEY ARE REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY AND INSPECT INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES IN THEIR THEIR REGION BECAUSE THOSE INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES ARE LEADING TO THEIR WATER QUALITY IMPAIRMENTS. SO LASTLY HOW DOES THIS HELP MUNICIPALITIES CITIES AND COUNTIES SO THE SENATOR SAID WELL I'M GONNA GET JUST AN EXAMPLE I TAKE THE LA RIVER -- IS IMPAIRED FOR NUMEROUS THINGS SO -- ELLIE METALS LET'S JUST USE THAT AS AN EXAMPLE PUTTING TOO MUCH MALES INTO THE RIVER BECAUSE THE RIVER TO BE TOXIC SO WITH THEREGIONAL BOARD DOES WHEN THEY DETERMINE THAT IT IS TO TOXIC IS THEY THEY DETERMINE HOW MUCH. OF METALS THE RIVER CAN -- ASSEMBLY HOW MUCH CAN THEY TAKE WITH THE CAPACITY THE DIVIDED AMONG ALL THE PERMIT TO USE THAT OUR DISK AGING IN THE ARE OF METALS INTO THE RIVER. WELL WE'RE FINDING THAT A IT IT'S UP TO FOUR OUT OF FIVE INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES ARE NOT UNDER THIS INDUSTRIAL PERMITS. SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THAT WAY 80% OF THE FOLKS THAT ARE DISCHARGING METALS INTO THE RIVER DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE AND ARE NOT UNDER THE PERMIT. THAN THOSE MUNICIPALITIES THAT ARE PAYING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR CHAIR THE PIE THAT LIABILITY DOESN'T GO AWAY UNTIL THE TEAM DEAL WITH THE THE IMPAIRMENT IS GONE. BUT 80% OF PEOPLE ARE STILL THIS CHARGING THAT THE IMPAIRMENTS NEVER GOING TO GO AWAY SO THIS DOES HELP MUNICIPALITIES -- LIABILITY AND WITH THAT I ASK YOU FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU. YOU HAVE A MAN AND A HALF. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS LAURIE CAMERON REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA METALS COALITION -- WE REPRESENT THE EMPLOYERS CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND METAL MANUFACTURERS -- IN CALIFORNIA WHO IMP EMPLOY APPROXIMATELY -- THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND WORKERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- WE LOOK AT THIS BILL AS PUTTING THOSE WHO HAVE PERMITS TO THOSE WHO ARE FILERS -- AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE. AGAINST THOSE WHO DO NOT HAVE THEIR PERMITS SO -- I THINK THAT THAT SENATOR HAS HAS STATED EVERYTHING VERY WELL AND MY COLLEAGUE SEAN -- HAS HAD ALL THE HYPE HI PARTS -- WE THINK THIS IS A VERY GOOD BELTS BRING IT BRINGING BUSINESS TOGETHER WITH -- THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS AND WE HAVE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL HERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THERESA BURKE WHICH I'VE BEEN ASKED TO REGISTER SUPPORT FOR SURFRIDER. GAVIN MCCUE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I TO DISMANTLE RECESSES AGENTS OF VERY GOOD BILL FOR BOTH REGULATED AND LICENSED BUSINESSES ND THE ENVIRONMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. BRIAN FLANAGAN ON BEHALF OF THE WEST COAST CHAPTER OF THE INSTITUTE SCRAP RECYCLING INDUSTRIES IN SUPPORT. YOUR TOO SO ON BEHALF OF HEAL THE BAY IN SUPPORT. NATALIE KNOCKS ON BEHALF OF FRIENDS OF THE LA RIVER IN SUPPORT. VERY GOOD OUR OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRED MEMBERS THERE DAHLE HIM HAVE LEGAL CALIFORNIA CITIES WE DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORED APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THIS BILL HOWEVER WE DO HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON IT. CURRENTLY AS WE DO HAVE FACE SOME IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES WITH THE BILL -- FIRST OF ALL I DO WANT TO SAY THAT SOME -- NOT EVERY JURISDICTION ISSUES BUSINESS LICENSES SO NOT ALL CITIES ISSUE BUSINESS LICENSES AND THAT COULD BE A POTENTIAL ISSUE WITH THIS BILL AS IT'S UNCLEAR TO US IF -- THAT WOULD MEAN THAT CITIES WOULD NEED TO ISSUE A BUSINESS LICENSE FOR THE ARE IT ALREADY CURRENTLY DOING IT IN THE BILL SECONDLY WE DO WANT TO SAY THAT CITIES ISSUE BUSINESS LICENSES IN DIFFERENT WAYS. FOR EXAMPLE A LOT OF CITIES ISSUE BUSINESS LICENSES IN AN ADMINISTRATIVE OVER THE COUNTER FASHION WHERE -- THE BUSINESS LICENSE WILL SUBMIT APPLICATION WHICH IS REALLY A AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE BUSINESS IN ORDER TO HAVE A TAX AGREEMENT SO THEY'LL SUBMIT THAT TO THE CITY AND THEN THE CITY SUBMITS THE BUSINESS LICENSE -- IF IMPLEMENTED MANY CITIES MAY NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT THEY ADMINISTER THE BUSINESS LICENSE PROCESS. IN ORDER COMPLY THE BILL AND WHERE WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT MAY DELAYED ISSUING A BUSINESS LICENSES -- THIRD THIS BILL COULD BE COSTLY AS THE CENTER HAS POINTED OUT IT COULD BE -- A DIFFICULT FOR CITIES TO IMPLEMENT AS WE HAVE TO CHANGE THOSE PROCESSES AND HIRE NEW STAFF IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE BILL -- BUT WE DO WANT TO SAY THAT MANY CITIES DO YOU CURRENTLY WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE WATER BOARD'S BOTH STATE AND REGIONAL IN ORDER -- TO COMPLY WITH THE MS FOUR CUP OF PERMITS AS WELL AS THE I. G. P. THE INDUSTRIAL GENERAL PERMIT -- PLANS AND WE DO WANT TO SAY THAT WEAPPRECIATE THE OVERALL INTENT OF THE BILL WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSORS TO GET TO A PLACE. THAT'S MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. VERY GOOD VERY GOOD OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. UP MISTER MATHIS. SENATOR I LIKE WHERE YOU'RE. TRYING TO GO HERE I'M JUST TRYING. TO WRAP MY HEAD AROUND THIS FULLY AS TO WHAT THE COST ON THE BUSINESS IS GOING TO BE KIDS. BASED ON YOUR TESTIMONY IT'S BASICALLY THE CITY'S JUST GOING TO VERIFY THAT THEY'VE GOT A BUSINESS LICENSE AND ARE GOOD TO GO WITH THE WATER BOARD IS THAT CORRECT THERE'S NOT GONNA BE AN ADDITIONAL COST ON OUR BUSINESSES. YEAH THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL COSTS IN THE BUSINESSES IN FACT IT'S GOING TO BE THE ARGUMENT THAT THE ONLY OPPOSITION THAT WE'VE HEARD SO FAR AS THE ARGUMENT IS THAT THE CITIES. ARE SAYING IT WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL COST AND THEN WE DON'T WANT THE RESPONSIBILITY AND ADDRESS THAT MY CLOSE. TO HAVE TO VERIFY THIS AND ALL IS GOING TO WEBSITE LOOKING IN MAKING SURE THAT THAT CODE APPLIES. IT A AND IT'S NOT ANY ADDITIONAL COST IN THE BUSINESS THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL FEE TO THE TO THE BUSINESS IS THAT WHEN YOU APPLY FOR A BUSINESS LICENSE AND JURISDICTIONS THAT REQUIRE THEM -- THAT YOU -- THAT INCLUDES THIS PROCESS WHICH YOU WHICH TO HAVE BOTH HELP THE BUSINESS AND HELPS A EVERY OTHER BUSINESS IN TOWN THAT ARE THE LAW BINDERS. BOB BITERS **** SO SINCE LEADERS ASKING THAT SOMEBODY DOWN AT CITY HALL GONNA CLICK OPEN A WEBSITE VERIFY THAT THEY'RE ON REGISTERED. THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT AND I WOULD SUGGEST YET DURING BEGINS AT ONE THING THE BUSY UNDER THE LAW CURRENTLY MUNICIPALITIES ARE REQUIRED TO FIND AND INSPECT INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES SO. YOU'RE YOU HAVE 80% THAT ARE ON REGISTERED 20% OF THE LAW BITERS THEY GET STUCK WITH THE TAB BASED UPON HOW MUCH POLLUTION THERE IS IN THE WATER WAY. AND IN ESSENCE WHAT IT SAYS IN IN IN HERE'S THE PERMIT YOU SHALL MAINTAIN AN INVENTORY OF ALL INDUSTRIAL COMMERCIAL FACILITIES. AND SOURCES WITHIN THE PERMITTED THE CITY'S JURISDICTION. REGARDLESS OF OWNERSHIP BUT COULD DISCHARGE POLLUTANTS TO STORM WATER TO THE MP FOUR AS AND IT GOES ON TO SAY. THE PERMIT THE SHALL DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PROCEDURES TO PROACTIVELY IDENTIFY ILLICIT DISH CHARGES ORIGINATING FROM PRIORITY AREAS CENTER I'VE GOT THE LANGUAGE IN FRONT OF ME AS WE DO OKAY I'M JUST TRYING TO GET MULLIN. LINE TERMS FOR ANYBODY WATCHING THAT'S RIGHT. SO THE PROBLEM OKAY THANK YOU. MADAM VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M SO SENATOR -- FOR THE CITY THE OPPOSITION BROUGHT UP SOME POINTS AND I SAW SOME DISCUSSION START TO TAKE PLACE. COMMENTS I WONDER IF YOU WANTED TO ADDRESS -- THE COMMENTS THAT HE MADE [inaudible] NHà. SO WHAT I MEAN I'M JUST DON'T TO ME TO BE INAPPROPRIATE BUT WE ALWAYS GET THE THE CITY'S I CHAIRED THE COMMITTEES BEFORE AND BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS FOR MANY YEARS. AND EVERY SINGLE TIME THE THE ARGUMENTS ARE ALL WAS YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING TO COST US MONEY RIGHT AND THAT'S ALWAYS THE ARGUMENT AND I WOULD SAY IN MANY INSTANCES THERE RIGHT. AND THE QUESTION IS SHOULD GOVERNMENT STATE GOVERNMENT IMPOSED THOSE OBLIGATIONS ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT MAY BE TO DO THINGS. THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY DOING. FAIR OBSERVATION. THAT'S NOT THE CASE HERE THE WORRY REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE LAW TO DO IT WE'RE JUST PROVIDING A PROCESS TO GET THERE. AND AND YOU KNOW WHAT BUT I'VE FOUND IN MY EXPERIENCE FOR THE DAYS OF WORK OF FOUR YEARS OF WORKING ON A LIVE CALL LAWS AND ALL THE VARIOUS ASPECTS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT INSURING THE SENATE COMMITTEE. OVERSEEING THIS IS THESE ARE THE STANDARD KINDS OF OBJECTIONS THAT YOU GET. AND ARE TO ME THIS ONE SURPRISES ME QUITE FRANKLY IN MY EXPERIENCE BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE DOING THE MATURE GAINING FAVOR BY VIRTUE OF HELPING. LEGITIMATE BUSINESS IS YOUR IN YOUR COMMUNITIES WHO ARE COMPLYING. AND SAYING WE'RE JUST LIKE WITH THE TESTIMONY WAS WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NON COMPLIANCE ARE CAUGHT. AND TO WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT THE TAXPAYERS ARE PROTECTED BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT TAXPAYERS ARE GOING TO GET SUBJECT TO HUGE FINES. IF THESE LOCAL CITIES ARE POLLUTING AND ALL WE'RE DOING IS FINDING AN ELEGANT MECHANISM IN MY JUDGMENT THAT REQUIRES THEM TO HAVE A A LINE ITEM ON A FORM. IT HAS TO BE FILLED OUT AND THEN THEY GO TO THE COMPUTER THEY HIT THE BUTTON ON THE WEBSITE AND THEY LOOK AT IT. AND THAT'S ALL THAT'S NEEDED TO BE DONE AND THAT WILL GO A LONG WAY IN MAKING SURE THE LOS COMPLIED WITH. AND THAT BUSINESSES ARE PROTECTED AND TAXPAYERS ARE PROTECTED THAT'S THE REASON WHY I FIND THIS ONE KIND OF ODD BUT OKAY NEW TO ME SO THEN IF IT'S SOMETHING OUT THROUGH THE CHAIR I GUESS. NO NO ABSOLUTE AT THE HEAD IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS ESSENTIALLY A FAVOR TO THE CITY'S -- WOULD BE HELPFUL TO THE CITIES THEN WHY HAVEN'T THE CITY'S IMPLEMENTED THIS ON THEIR OWN SOME HAVE. SOME ALREADY HAVE SOME HAVE SOME HAVE IN THIS IS BASICALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT. A AND I IT'S QUITE FRANKLY I I THINK HONESTLY MY OWN PERSONAL OPINION IS SOME JIM THOUGHT OF IT AT SOME POINT BUT WE KNOW THAT SOME HAVE. AND ARE DOING THIS STUFF THIS JUST REQUIRES ACROSS THE STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT. OF BOTH I THOUGHT THE ELEGANT COMMENT THAT WAS MADE I THINK IS% MISTER FLANAGAN MADE ABOUT BOTH THE REGULATORY SIDE IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL CITED HOW UNIQUE THAT IS AND THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT THIS IS A PRETTY ELEGANT SOLUTION. OKAY SO THEN AS IT JUST A FINAL THOUGHT -- THE REQUIREMENT WOULD NOT COME WITH ANY FUNDS FOLLOWING THAT TO HELP CITIES IMPLEMENT THIS I KNOW YOU SAID THAT IT'S JUST A MATTER OF LOOKING ON THE WEBSITE AND ALL THAT BUT AS YOU KNOW CITIES. ON THEIR BUDGETS ARE SHRINKING AND THEY HAVE THEIR MORE AND MORE STRAIN WITH WHAT THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR SO IT IS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THEY WOULD MEAN VERY LIKELY. THEY WOULD CHOOSE TO RAISE THE COST OF CERTAIN FEES FOR PERMITTING IN THEIR CITY. TO COVER THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH DOING THIS SO IS THERE ANY STATE FUNDING THAT WILL FOLLOW THIS TYPE OF REGULATION OR I GUESS -- YOU KNOW IMPOSING THIS TYPE A BURDEN ON CITIES. WHAT A BOOK I I I JUST THE ANSWER THE QUESTION SPECIFICALLY TO BE DIRECTORS NOW OKAY BUT? THE THE AYE AYE I JUST ARE THE ONLY I DISAGREE IS THIS IS NOT A BURDEN IT'S A HELP THAT THEY DON'T OTHERWISE KNOWLEDGE HELP THEIR BUSINESSES AND TO HELP THEIR TAXPAYERS. AND IN FACT IT'S THAT IT'S A CHEAP INEXPENSIVE WAY TO AVOID LIABILITY AND IT'S A PRETTY NIFTY WAY I THINK -- THAT WAS THAT WAS BROUGHT TO ME AND THAT'S WHY I'M SUPPORTING IT BUT I DON'T THINK IT ALL A BIRD WE'VE WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF LOS THAT WE'VE HAD A TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE BURDENS. AND THIS CERTAINLY ISN'T ONE OF THEM. THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. CHAU -- BILLS BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED -- I HAVE A QUESTION SURE AND THAT IS IT. APPARENTLY SOME CITIES DON'T ISSUE BUSINESS PERMITS I HEARD THAT FROM THE OPPOSITION I DID TOO WE DON'T REQUIRE IF IT'S ONLY IF. WE DON'T WOULD REQUIRE THEM SO IF THEY DON'T THEN THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED THEN THEY'RE NOT RESERVE ACCOUNT THESE DON'T WE HAVE A LIST OF THE WAS IN THE OTHER. THE A COUPLE TIMES AGO I DIDN'T READ IT BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING WHERE CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS DON'T DO THAT IT EATS AT IF YOU HAVE A PERMIT. THEN YOU HAVE TO DO THIS IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PERMIT THAT YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED. SOME SMALLER COMMUNITIES IS FOR AN EIGHTY TWO CITIES IN CALIFORNIA FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY SOME DON'T AND SO IN THOSE INSTANCES YOU NOT RECORD. OKAY WELL THAT CERTAINLY TAKES CARE ONE OF THE OBJECTION THAT'S RIGHT. AND I WOULD AGREE. LOOKING ON THE WEBSITE IN THIS DAY AND AGE YOU SHOULD NOT BE A BIG BURDEN. UP WHITE SIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SENATOR I THINK I AND THAT'S THE REASON THE FURTHER QUESTIONS I THINK I JUST OVER THE IT WAS ON MY MIND AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE TIME AND I APOLOGIZE. FOR THE DELAY IN GETTING HERE. IT'S MUCH RELIABLE ALL RIGHT. MADAM SECRETARY. THIS IS ITEM NUMBER THREE SB TWO OH FIVE HERTZBERG THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT. QUIRK. AYE QUIRK AYE MELENDEZ ARAMBULA. OUR QUE HAN. OUR CAN I CRISTINA GARCIA. HOLDEN. HOLDEN AYE. MATHIS ARE. MATHIS HI MURATSUCHI. SO WE HAVE -- FOR RIGHT OKAY SO -- THEY LACK THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE WILL GET HEARING TO CARSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEMBERS MISTER CHAIRMAN PUSH AT THE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE SENATOR ALAN. WHO IS NOT HERE YET [inaudible] AS RIGHT ALRIGHT CENTER ALLEN. WE'RE NOW GOING TO HEAR YOUR BILL SB THREE NINE TWO HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. IN CHEMISTRY CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND OF COURSE THE IDEA HERE IS TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS. ALL RIGHT THAT WAS SPEEDED UP. WITH A YEAH THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS I I HI I THINK WHAT YOU'RE HEARING IS A REFLECTION OF OF BOTH THE VALUE AND IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL IN TERMS OF PROTECTING CONSUMERS FROM HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS IN OUR DAILY LIVES WHAT WITH THE COMMISSION WITH THE HARD WORK OF OUR STAFF. AND AND AND STAKEHOLDERS WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE INDUSTRY'S WHO ARE IMPACTED BY THIS LEGISLATION AND WE COMMITTED TO AMENDMENTS THAT WILL ADDRESS MANY THEIR CONCERNS WHILE STILL IMPROVING EXISTING PROGRAM AND I THINK YOU'LL HEAR THAT. THEY'VE COME OFF OPPOSITION THAT'S A FANTASTIC THING SO I'M HAPPY TO GO INTO MORE DETAILS I KNOW THAT THE HOURS LATE IN THIS COMMITTEE -- BUT BUT I'M I'M PERSONALLY VERY GRATEFUL TO I THIS COMMITTEE AND AND MY STAFF HI ERIC AND AND OTHERS WHO WORK REALLY HARD TO GET US TO A PLACE WHERE WE'RE WE'RE REALLY ARE GOING TO MAKE. HIS GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM SOMETHING IT'S REAL IT'S PAST TEN YEARS AGO REPORTS COME OUT SHOWING THAT VERY LITTLE HAS HAPPENED UNDER THE PROGRAM. TO ACTUALLY PROTECT CONSUMERS WE'VE GOT TO MAKE GIVE IT SOME. WE GOT TO MAKE A REAL AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL SEEKS O DO AND WITH ME HERE WE TODAY WE HAVE A CAR FROM THAT'S A RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL IN UNDER EVAN TURNER FROM. CLEAN WATER ACTION TESTIFIED SUPPORT THANK YOU [inaudible] GO AHEAD. I'M GONNA BE BRIEFED BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS JUST SAID YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO GIVE US A LITTLE DOSE OF REALITY HERE THAT THIS IS ABOUT REAL WORLD THINGS THIS IS NOT JUST A A LEGAL EXERCISE TO HAVE THIS LAWN PLACE. METHYLENE CHLORIDE HAS KILLED SIXTY FOUR PEOPLE THAT WE KNOW OF ACROSS THE COUNTRY INCLUDING A CALIFORNIAN IN HUNTINGTON PARK. DID YOU SEE HAS RESPONDED TO THAT THROUGH THIS PROGRAM FLAME RETARDANTS THE SAME THING LINKED TO SERIOUS HEALTH EFFECTS. PARTICULARLY IN CHILDREN. THAT IS WHY WE NEED THIS PROGRAM TO WORK BECAUSE WE NEED TO PROTECT WE NEED TO WORK WITH BUSINESS TO PROTECT THE THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC. AS YOU HEARD IT IS NOT MOVING FAST ENOUGH THE INDEPENDENT REPORT THAT CAME OUT THIS YEAR HAS. CONFIRMED THAT THAT IS WHY WE CO SPONSORING THIS BILL BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE THE FIXES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO MAKE THIS REALLY INNOVATIVE PROGRAM WORK FOR BOTH BUSINESS. FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND FOR PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE THANK YOU AND WE DO HOPE THAT THIS BILL WILL MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT MY NAME IS AVINASH CAR -- THE DIRECTOR FOR STATE HEALTH POLICY WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL WE'RE GOING SPONSORS OF THE BILL AND STRONG SUPPORT THIS BILL IMPROVED. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM BY SPEEDING UP THE PROCESS -- ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF AN INDEPENDENT REPORT IT GOT ENSURES GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY PROVIDES FOR BETTER DATA COLLECTION AND IS STREAMLINED ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES TO HELP INSURE THE PROGRAM MOVES FORWARD MORE QUICKLY -- WE HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH -- INDUSTRY ON THIS ISSUE AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE DURING GET GAUGE MEN AND THANK THEM FOR THEIR EFFORTS. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REACH AGREEMENT ON KEY -- PORTIONS OF THIS BILL AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO MOVE THE BOOK BILL FORWARD -- GOING FORWARD WILL BE IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAM HAS A STABLE AND SECURE SOURCE OF FUNDING -- TO TO HELP KEEP ITS MISSION MOVING FORWARD AND BUILD ON IMPROVEMENTS IN THIS BILL -- BUT THAT WE ASK FOR AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT OTHERS IN SUPPORT. I'M BILL ALLEY -- FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP WITH THE THIRD CO SPONSORED THE BILL AND SO OBVIOUSLY STRONGLY IN SUPPORT URGE ITS PASSAGE. I'M ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF PHYSICIANS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY SAN FRANCISCO AND THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY NAIL SALON COLLABORATIVE THANK YOU GREAT. JANUARY TERRACE ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT. THERESA BROKERAGE ON BEHALF OF THE LOCAL ADMINISTRATORS OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH IN SUPPORT. CARE TO SO ON BEHALF OF THE CLEAN SEIZE LOBBYING COALITION IN SUPPORT. MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS AND SUPPORT. LAUREN COMMISSAIRE CLUB CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. SO -- YES PLEASE COME UP FOR THE PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE TEN JUST LIKE WITH THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL I FIRST WANT TO US THANKS AND AROUND HIS STAFF -- SCORE ANY OTHER OF THE SPONSORS THE BILL FOR WORKING WITH US OVER THE PAST A COUPLE WEEKS AND JUST AS LATE AS YESTERDAY. A WORK TRYING TO FINE TUNE SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS WE HAD RAISE SOME ISSUES ABOUT -- THE NEED FOR CONTINUED STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROCESS OF CREATION OF THIS TWO STEP PROCESS -- FOR FOR STAKEHOLDERS TO ENGAGE DGSE AND HOW THEY UTILIZE SOME OF THE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION -- WAS IMPORT TO US AS IS THE NEED -- FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE SOME SUBSTANTIAL TIME. TO RESPOND TO ANY SORT OF TTC DGSE DATA REQUEST IN CALLING INFORMATION I THINK WE HAVE -- CERTAINLY CONCEPT WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT THE OTHER DAY -- IF THEY HAVE COME TO A POINT WHERE WHERE WE CANNOT REMOVE OPPOSITE TO THIS BILL APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT WITH HAS GONE INTO IT. SO IN CONCEPT YOU CAN. YOU YOU'VE GOT WERE I I THINK WHERE THEY'RE AT WE'RE JUST WERE. WE'LL WE'LL GET THE LANGUAGE BUT AS OF THIS POINT -- WERE WILL NO LONGER LOS THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WHAT WILL BE? ALL RIGHT OTHER GOOD AFTERNOON OF COOKING UNITS ON BEHALF OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION THE FRAGRANCE CREATORS ASSOCIATION AND I WAS ASKED TO REGISTER A NEUTRAL POSITION FOR ON THE AMERICAN CUTTINGS ASSOCIATION SO THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO WORKED ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU. CAPTION CHAIR MEMBERS AT A REGULAR BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ONE ECHO THE SAME COMMENTS WE APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE PROPONENTS AND THE AUTHOR. AND WE ARE MOVING TO A NEUTRAL POSITION THANK YOU. TOM JACOB ON BEHALF OF THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY COUNCIL CALIFORNIA. LIKEWISE -- APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE ENCOURAGEMENT FROM YOU SENATOR. TO GET US TOGETHER AND WE FOUND IT VERY SATISFYING -- IT'S NOT THE BILL WE WOULD -- PUT OUT THERE -- IT DOESN'T ADDRESS EVERYTHING THAT IS A CHALLENGE WITH RESPECT TO MOVING THE SEP PROGRAM FORWARD. BUT WE APPRECIATE WHERE WE ENDED UP THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WELL THAT'S WONDERFUL I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR MAKING OUR JOB EASIER -- A QUESTIONS MISTER MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU A SERVER I KNOW THAT -- YOU ALWAYS WORK HARD TO TRY TO MAKE OUR JOBS EASIER AND I I APPRECIATE THAT BUT YOU KNOW I OBVIOUSLY I I SUPPORT -- TO THE THE THE INTENT IN THE GOAL IF YOUR BILL MY CONCERN IS. IS THAT -- IN THIS TO BE THE SECOND TIME I RAISES CONCERN TODAY AND NOT NECESSARILY ON YOUR BILL BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE BEEN IT. ATTEMPTS. TO TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT TO THIS COMMITTEE THAT THAT SOMETIMES A GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM IS INADEQUATE. YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN WHEN. THE THE THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR AND AND AND ONE OTHER OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE ADOPTED STANDARDS -- THAT THAT WE WE WE YOU KNOW MAKE THE ARGUMENT -- TO TO BANNED CERTAIN CHEMICALS FROM CONSUMER PRODUCTS THAT OFTEN THE THE RESPONSE AS WELL WE HAVE THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM AND AND THAT -- AND THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE. TAKEN APPROACH OF OF OF BANNING WHEN THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR IN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE WE SHOULD FALL THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM. CONSUMERS ARE ADDRESS MY CONCERN THAT YOU KNOW MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION ARE NOW NEUTRAL ARE GONNA BE COMING BACK -- TO MY BILL NEXT YEAR SAYING WELL WE HAVE THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM. YEAH I THINK THE PROBLEM IS AND AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THIS COMMITTEE WORK -- WITH OUR COMMITTEE ON THE SENATE SIDE TO PRESENT THE FINDINGS OF THE SCREEN CHEMISTRY AT TEN YEARS REPORT THAT I'M I KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH AND THE FACT IS IS THAT -- IN TEN YEARS NOT A SINGLE CHEMICAL HAS HAD AN ALTERNATE ANALYSIS COMPLETED UNDER THE CIVIL CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM NOT. A SINGLE REGULATION HAS RESULTED. AND SO. WE DID HAVE THE PROGRAM ON PAPER NOW WE WANT TO GIVE IT SOME. RETURNING A REALITY TO BELIEVE SOMETHING THAT THAT IS THAT THAT THAT MEETS THE GOALS OF WHAT WAS IT ORIGINALLY PUT FORWARD -- YOU KNOW PART OF WHAT THE BILL DOES IS IS IS MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN WE CAN -- USE AVAILABLE INFORMATION THAT'S OUT THERE -- WE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT HIGH QUALITY EVIDENCE THAT WAS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION IN THAT THE KIND OF THE CALIBER OF THE EVIDENCE. THAT WE MIGHT BE USED -- TO TO IMPACT A PARTICULAR CHEMICAL -- YOU KNOW THERE ALSO WAS WAS WAS LANGUAGE THAT WAS TAKEN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DATA CALLING AUTHORITY OF THE TNC WOULD BE EXERCISED RESPONSIBLY TRANSPARENTLY THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES THAT EXISTED THAT THAT. WE WE THE OF OUR DEPARTMENT DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH AUTHORITY UNDER THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM TO GET THE SORT OF INFORMATION THAT NEED THE DATA NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE WISE DECISIONS AND SO. I THINK WHAT THE OPPOSITION WANTED WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT THE YEAH THE THE THE THE THAT THAT THAT THAT AUTHORITY WOULD BE EXERCISED IN A IN A RESPONSIBLE TRANSPARENT WAY -- BUT BUT BUT ANY OF THE DAY I WE WILL. IF IF IF THERE IS A LEGITIMATE REASON TO TO BAN A CHEMICAL AND AND THAT IS OUT THERE IN THE YEAH AND THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S AMPLE EVIDENCE -- IT WILL BE A IF IF IF IF THE IF THE IF THE IF THE EVIDENCE IS THERE. IT WILL GET WILL GET ADDRESS AND IN THIS PROGRAM -- YOU KNOW AND LET LET'S HAVE A CONVERSATION IF IF THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH A PARTICULAR CHEMICAL THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE YOU REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT -- BUT IN THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS GOING TO ENSURE THAT -- THAT THAT ARE REGULARS WILL HAVE THE BOTH THE THE DATA COLLECTION INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED AND ALSO THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED. TO BE ABLE TO TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC -- BUT BUT DO SO IN A WAY I I THINK THAT THAT THAT MET SOME OF THE THE RIGOROUS STANDARDS IN SOME OF THE DUE PROCESS STANDARDS THAT ARE. THE FOLKS INDUSTRY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT WITH REGARDS TO HOW THE BILL WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN. YEAH THE CENTER AYE AYE. AYE SIR TO START OFF BY SAYING THAT I WILL BE VOTING IN SUPPORT OF YOUR BILL AND THE OTHER YOU KNOW -- THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT. THAT DAD THIS IS A A WORTHWHILE EFFORT BUT I'M I'M JUST REFERRING A TO A THIS COMMITTEES ANALYSIS ON YOUR COLLEAGUES -- THE TALKING YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T READ THIS BUT ON ON SERRA CABALLERO IS BILL EARLIER THERE'S A PASSAGE IN HEARING GETTING. THAT IT IS LONG BEING RECOGNIZE THAT THE TSC DOES NOT HAVE THE RESOURCE OKAY -- TO THE THIS IS FOR SB THREE SEVENTEEN ON PAGE FIVE YEAH. YOU KNOW IT IS JUST MAKING THE POINT THAT. TO NOT ONLY DOES THE S. C. P. THAT THE SAFE CONSUMER. PRODUCTS PROGRAM LACK A DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCE THE FUN DTS HE'S WORKED WITH DTS USE CURRENTLY OPERATING UNDER A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT LEAVING FOR THE CONSTRAINED RESOURCES -- DTC HAS HAD HISTORIC HIT CHALLENGES DO SIR DID RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS AND SO I KNOW YOUR BILL CALLS -- FOR ADEQUATE FUNDING BUT I I JUST WITH A AGAIN I I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT -- THIS PROGRAM IS NOT USE I SHARE THAT CONCERN LET'S WORK TOGETHER ON ON SOME BUDGET -- PLAY FOR IN THAT DIRECTION I KNOW THE MY WITNESSES WANTED TO RESPOND TO THIS IS WELL IF IF THROUGH THE CHAIR IF IF AT ALL -- OKAY BUT BRIEFLY. IT IS VERY LONG DAY I JUST REYES YES IT HAS. I JUST WANT TO SAY YOU KNOW YOU WERE ELECTED OFFICIALS IF THERE IS VERY STRONG EVIDENCE ABOUT SOMETHING AND IT'S VERY EVIDENT FROM ANOTHER GOVERNMENT OR WHATEVER AND AND THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES TO ACT. THE BILL WHEN IT WAS FIRST CONCEIVED NEVER TOOK THAT AWAY FROM YOU. ARE AND SO. YOU WILL -- YOU KNOW YOU WOULD ALWAYS HAVE THAT OPTION AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY THIS IS OF COURSE AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM BECAUSE THOSE THOSE SOLUTIONS OF WHAT TO DO ABOUT TOXIC CHEMICALS ARE NOT ALWAYS EVIDENT. AND THIS CAMERA THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES THE SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND TO AVOID REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTIONS AND MAKE SURE WE'RE GOING FORWARD IN A IN A SAFE. AND REASONABLE WAY SO I THAT I THINK THAT'S THE RESPONSE THAT I WOULD. PROVIDE TO THAT QUESTION AND I WOULD AGREE A 100% AND I THINK THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THAT. IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THAT WE HAVE A FULL PROCESS IN MANY CASES NOW JUST BANNING LEAD IN JEWELRY WHICH WE JUST DID. THAT WAS EASY. AND WE DIDN'T NEED TO GO TO GREEN CHEMISTRY RENO LEADS A PROBLEM AND THERE'S NO REASON TO HAVE A JEWELRY AND THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A SUBSTITUTE. CABINET WE ALSO DID THE SAME -- IN DAHLE NOT BANNING LEAD BUT MAKING IT A VERY SMALL AMONT THE SAME FOR CADMIUM. AND AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT WHEN THERE'S A CONSENSUS AND WHEN WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A VIABLE. ALTERNATIVE -- BUT THIS IS KIND OF BEYOND THE CURRENT SCOPE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING. ARE THERE OTHER QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS GO AHEAD MADAM VICE CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER ALLEN SO. OKAY -- THE GREEN INITIATIVE. PROGRAM. HAS BEYOND HOW MANY CHEMICALS SINCE IT CAME INTO EXISTENCE NOT A SINGLE ONE NOT YEAH OKAY AND THEY'VE BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR LIKE TEN YEARS RIGHT. OKAY SO HERE'S WHAT I'M STRUGGLING WITH WHY. YOU HAVE WRITTEN IN THIS BILL. FINDS PRETTY. PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL FINES SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER VIOLATION OR PER DAY. WHICH ALLOWED HE TSC TO IMPOSE IF THEY REQUESTED CHEMICAL INGREDIENT PRODUCT INFORMATION IS NOT PROVIDED SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TODAY. BUT THERE IS NO. SIMILAR BURDENSOME IMPOSITION PLACED ON DTS SEE FOR NOT. DOING THEIR JOB WHICH IS I MEAN. SO DID YOU SEE HAS COME UP -- THE GREEN INITIATIVE IS COME UP WITH GREEN CHEMISTRY SORRY HAS COME UP WITH THIS LIST. SO FAR THAT'S ALL I KNOW THAT THEY'VE DONE OF CHEMICAL SAID YOU KNOW CAN BE AN ISSUE AND THEY'VE GONE NO NO FURTHER THAN THAT. SO I'M JUST I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY WE ARE EVEN. PERPETUATING THE EXISTENCE OF THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE DOING ANYTHING WITH THAT SAID SO SO. WHAT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE ADDRESSING THE VERY ISSUE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT SO SO SO THAT VERY QUESTION AS ASKED BY THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE THAT? PRESENT THIS REPORT WHY IS IT THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE. TO DO ANYTHING YOU KNOW IS IT BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND PEOPLE THAT THAT YEAR SORRY THAT WAY THE FIGHT BY THE WAY THE FINES FOR FOR FOR YOUR PERMISSION IT HAS COME DOWN IN IT AS PART OF OUR NEGOTIATED. A DEAL SO IT'S NOT GONNA BE -- SEVENTY THOUSAND BUT BUT WHAT I'LL SAY IS WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT THE TEACHERS HE DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE CALL IN FORTY FOR TO THE DATA THEY WE WEREN'T GETTING THE SORT OF INFORMATION THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS. EFFECTIVELY AND QUICKLY IN ADDITION THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO ACCESS ALL SORTS OF REALLY GOOD PEER REVIEWED INFORMATION OUT IN THE PUBLIC THEY HAD TO DO THEIR OWN. INTERNAL NOW SEES UNDER THE GREEN CHEMISTRY INITIATIVE AS AS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN OKAY IF I MAY JUST INTERJECT THAT WASN'T THE WHOLE POINT OF THE GREEN CHEMISTRY INITIATIVE IS THAT YOU HAD. DETAILS HE HAD AT ITS DISPOSAL ITS OWN SCIENTISTS TO TO DO THIS TYPE OF RESEARCH IS NOT THE POINT. PART OF PART OF THE POINT I MEAN WE DO OKAY BECAUSE THAT THE ARGUMENT NOW IS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION -- OR THERE IS ENOUGH PEER REVIEWED INFORMATION THAT THAT IS AVAILABLE TO THEM -- NO THERE'S TONS OF GOOD PEER REVIEWED INFORMATION THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE THE THE INITIATIVE -- THE TO NOT THEY WEREN'T THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO ACCESS THE WAY WILL USE IT FOR DECISION MAKING UNDER THE OLD STRUCTURE. SO WHAT WE'RE DOING UNDER THIS STRUCTURE IS ALLOWING THEM TO USE HIGH QUALITY CARD REVIEWED INFORMATION. OKAY THAT'S AND IT'S OUT THERE OKAY SO I GET THAT BUT AGAIN GOING BACK TO THE WHOLE POINT OF PUTTING THIS GROUP TOGETHER IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS TO HAVE. SCIENTISTS AT OUR DISPOSAL TO DO SOME OF THIS WORK WHICH THEY HAVE NOT DONE. SO I JUST I MEAN THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE THEM THE TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO DO THE WORK RIGHT THAT BECAUSE BECAUSE THE THE DATE -- THEY THEY DO HAVE A SMALL STAFF THEY ARE UNDER RESOURCE. I THEY'VE GOT LIMITED. CAPABILITY BOTH BOTH FROM A FROM A FROM A FROM INFRASTRUCTURE PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF THE WAY THE RULES ARE WRITTEN. SO WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THIS IS ALLOWING THEM TO BOTH HAVE MORE AUTHORITY TO GET THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO MAKE THE DECISION THAT YOU TO MAKE. AND BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY ACCESS AND UTILIZE HIGH QUALITY PEER REVIEWED INFORMATION -- THAT THAT THAT'S OUT THERE -- IN IN THE SCIENCE YOU KNOW IT IT IT IT IT'S BEING USED BY OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES AROUND THE WORLD WHY WOULD THEY NOT BE ALLOWED TO USE IT NOW IT WAS THE WAY IT WAS STRUCTURED. WHEN THE BILL WAS WRITTEN TO TRY TO YEAH SO I'VE RIGHT NOW THE WAY THE PROCESS IS STRUCTURED -- ONCE A PRODUCT CHEMICAL COMBINATION IS IDENTIFIED. INDUSTRY -- MANUFACTURERS GET TO DO THEIR OWN ANALYSES EACH PRODUCT IN THIS SCENARIO WHERE AND STUDIES AND EXISTING SCIENTISTS STRONG ENOUGH THE AGENCY CAN AVOID HAVING TO DO INDIVIDUAL AS ALTERNATIVES ANALYSES PROPHECIES. AND INSTEAD ENGAGE IN A ONE STEP ALTERNATES ANALYSIS PROCESS PROCESS CONDUCTED BY AGENCY SCIENTISTS GET NOTICE AND COMMENT. AND THEREFORE REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT IN THE PROCESS PLEASE [inaudible] OKAY. OKAY SO -- IT ALLOWS THEM TO REALIGN PEER REVIEWED SCIENCE OTHER GOVERNMENTS OR CREDIBLE INSTITUTIONS IS THAT. THE LANGUAGE -- OUTLINED ACTUALLY -- THE STAIN JING. TALKING TO MY I'M SORRY MY APOLOGIES -- YES THE LANGUAGE IS CHANGING THOUGH THE LANGUAGE UNDER DISCUSSION IS TO REFER -- TO THE REGULATIONS ALREADY BEEN A ALREADY PROMULGATED BY THE AGENCY AND THEY HAVE A DEFINITION OF RELIABLE INFORMATION THAT RECALL -- REFERS TO PEER REVIEWED LITERATURE AND OTHER SOURCES OF INFORMATION THAT ARE CONSIDERED RELIABLE AND THE BILL WILL POINT DIRECTLY TO THAT DEFINITION THE REGULATIONS. INTO THE CHAIR THERE'S ALSO IN THERE'S ALSO -- LANGUAGE ABOUT ABOUT -- DIGITS IS FIVE YOUR WORK PLANS. SHAPING SO AS TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE DOING THIS WORK. SO THE DRESSER VERY CAN YEAH. THANK YOU FOR THIS CLARIFYING QUESTIONS [inaudible] UP. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAUER CAM. THANK YOU CHAIR -- I JUST WANT TO YOU KNOW SAY THAT I THINK. CLEARLY AS THE CHAIRMAN CHEN THEIR SITUATIONS LIKE LEADING CHILDREN'S STORY THAT ARE BLACK AND WHITE BUT WE SAW WOULD BE P. A. B. PS THAT WHEN WE BàN SOMETHING WE CAN HAVE REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTES AND I THINK THAT. THIS PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED IN A WAY THAT WAS SMART RIGHT THAT WE LOOK AT THE SCIENCE THAT WE DON'T MAKE REGRETTABLE DECISIONS THAT DOWN THE ROAD CREATE MORE TOXIC OUTCOMES FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS THAN WE HAD BEFORE. AND SO I WANT TO THANK SENATOR ALLEN FOR BRINGING THIS IN FOR LOOKING LONG AND HARD AT HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS PROGRAM WORK BECAUSE IN ITS DESIGN. IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO WHICH IS USE GOOD SCIENCE TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT IS THE BEST THING FOR THE CONSTITUENTS OF CALIFORNIA AND SO WE NEED TO GET IT WORKING DESIGN WASN'T ENOUGH RIGHT WHEN IT FUNCTIONING AND I HOPE THAT THIS WILL -- WORK I DON'T THINK IT HAS A SUNSET BUT I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN AS REVISITING THIS IS HOME POINT BECAUSE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. THIS HAS MOVE THE BALL WE NEED TO AS WE FIND THIS PROGRAM WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT -- WE'RE SEEING THEM REALLY DO THE WORK WE NEED THEM TO OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S IN THEIR PRODUCTS AND SO THEY HAVE TO ACT. YES AND LET ME SUGGEST -- OR TAKE YOUR SUGGESTION THAT WE HAVE A REVIEW I DON'T THINK NEXT YEAR BUT HOW ABOUT THE YEAR AFTER. AND JUST. HAVE THE COMMITTEE COME BEFORE US AND WE CAN DO JOINTLY. WITH SANITY Q. WITH THE CENTER ALLEN. AND JUST TO REVIEW AND FIND OUT. HOW THEY'RE DOING IN? AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO AND I THINK THE VICE CHAIRS RAISED A REAL CONCERN. AND SO I WOULD SAY. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NEXT TERM HOPEFULLY WE'LL ALL BE HERE. THAT'S THE HOPE [inaudible] GOOD. AND THE AND WE SHOULD WE SHOULD WORK ON THAT SO LET'S PUT THAT IN OUR WORK PLAN. FOR TWENTY THE TO BE. TWENTY TWENTY ONE LET'S DO IT. INTO GOOD SUGGESTION NOW THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- OUR QUE HAN VERY GOOD. ARE YOU MAY CLOSE WELL MEMBERS I I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DISCUSSION I DO THINK WHERE WE ARE WE ARE GETTING THE VERY ISSUES THAT -- SOMEWHERE MELENDEZ REYES ADDRESSED HERE AND THAT ARE THAT ARE THE OUTLINED IN THIS REPORT -- I WANT TO GIVE MY DEEP THANKS BOTH TO ARTS SPONSORS INTO THE OPPOSITION WHO JUST WORKED REALLY HARD I I I KNOW THESE THINGS ARE NOT EASY. AND THERE ARE A LOT OF A VERY CONCERNS BUT I REALLY THINK WE'RE ABLE TO MEET. THE CORE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION -- WHILE MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY THE BILL WHICH REALLY ULTIMATELY IS ALL ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE WE WE DO FILL THE PROMISE OF THE GREEN CHEMISTRY INITIATIVE AND MAKE SURE THAT'S PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS -- WELL NOT AT THE SAME TIME I RAISING. THE SPECTER OF REGRETTABLE TORNADOES THAT COULD CAUSE DAMAGE ELSEWHERE -- AND WITH THAT I I WANT TO A LOSS OF JUST ONE F THAT GIVE A SPECIAL THANKS TO IT TO ERIC WALTERS IS A FANTASTIC SCIENCE FELLOW AND AND IS NOT. AN EXAMPLE OF THAT THE STRENGTH IN THE THE EPORTS OF THIS GREAT PROGRAM FOR CAPITAL. I WILL SECOND THAT THANK YOUNG TO WORK SO WITH THAT -- VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK OF THE COMMITTEE ON THIS AS WELL AND AND AND THAT'S WHEN I GO. THANK YOU -- GREAT BILL -- RECOMMEND THAT WE YEAH PASS FAIL MADAM SECRETARY. THIS IS ITEM FIVE SB THREE NINETY TWO ALAN THE MOTION IS DO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY QUIRK. AYE QUIRK AYE MELENDEZ -- MELENDEZ NO -ARAMBULA. ARAMBULA I POWER QUE HAN. OUR QUE HAN I CRISTINA GARCIA. HOLDEN. HOLDEN AYE [inaudible] MATHIS [inaudible] MURATSUCHI HI. RED SWEETIE HI.
