00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:47.978
SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE BELIEVES

00:40:48.045 --> 00:40:49.213
THAT THEY'VE BEEN EXPOSED OR HAS

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:54.018

OUR EFFORT TO AND INSIDE B. --

00:41:01.225 --> 00:41:04.094
INFECTIONS ON UNFORTUNATELY --

00:41:04.161 --> 00:41:06.931
THE UPTAKE OF PROP IN PARTICULAR --

00:41:06.997 --> 00:41:08.732
HAS BEEN NOT WHAT WE WANT

00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:10.267
PARTICULARLY IN COMMUNITIES OF

00:41:10.334 --> 00:41:12.570
COLOR -- BUT REALLY OUTSIDE OF

00:41:12.636 --> 00:41:14.972
OUR METROPOLITAN AREAS AND WE

00:41:15.039 --> 00:41:16.607
ARE STILL SEEING PEOPLE GET

00:41:16.674 --> 00:41:18.309
INFECTED AND THERE ARE MANY MANY

00:41:18.375 --> 00:41:20.845
PEOPLE -- IN CALIFORNIA WHO

00:41:20.911 --> 00:41:23.247
COULD BENEFIT FROM PROP WHO ARE

00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:24.782
NOT ON IT AND THERE ARE VARIOUS

00:41:24.849 --> 00:41:29.153
BARRIERS -- TO PROP ON AND WE

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.387
ARE ADDRESSING TWO OF THEM IN

00:41:30.454 --> 00:41:33.157
THIS BILL -- THE FIRST IS THAT.

00:41:33.224 --> 00:41:34.692
THERE ARE STILL INSURANCE

00:41:34.758 --> 00:41:36.260
COMPANIES THAT ARE REQUIRING

00:41:36.327 --> 00:41:40.030
PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS FOR PROP.

00:41:40.097 --> 00:41:41.532
AND FOR PAP -- IT FOR PEPPERS

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:42.666
PARTICULARLY OUTRAGEOUS WHEN

00:41:42.733 --> 00:41:44.001
THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO

00:41:44.068 --> 00:41:45.736
GO ON THE POP WITHIN SEVENTY TWO

00:41:45.803 --> 00:41:48.272
HOURS OF EXPOSURE -- IN ORDER

00:41:48.339 --> 00:41:50.307
FOR IT TO BE A FACTOR -- AND

00:41:50.374 --> 00:41:51.542
WE'VE HAD SITUATIONS WHERE

00:41:51.609 --> 00:41:52.910
INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE --

00:41:52.977 --> 00:41:54.678
REQUIRED PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS

00:41:54.745 --> 00:41:56.146
FOR THAT SEVENTY TWO HOUR PERIOD

00:41:56.213 --> 00:41:58.315
WHICH IS OUTRAGEOUS -- BUT FOR

00:41:58.382 --> 00:42:00.718
PROP AS WELL -- WHEN SOMEONE IS

00:42:00.784 --> 00:42:09.159
AT RISK -- THEY SHOULD BE ABLE

00:42:09.226 --> 00:42:10.060
TO GET ACCESS TO PROP.

00:42:10.127 --> 00:42:11.428
QUICKLY AND NOT HAVE TO WAIT

00:42:11.495 --> 00:42:12.529
TIMES A MONTH FOR A PRIOR

00:42:12.596 --> 00:42:13.163
AUTHORIZATION SO THE BILL WILL

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:15.532
BAN PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS FOR

00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:17.601
PROBLEM TOP -- THE OTHER --

00:42:17.668 --> 00:42:19.169
BARRIER THAT THE BILL ADDRESSES

00:42:19.236 --> 00:42:21.438
IS IN TERMS OF HOW TO ACCESS THE

00:42:21.505 --> 00:42:23.340
HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS WHO

00:42:23.407 --> 00:42:24.775
CAN PROVIDE.

00:42:24.842 --> 00:42:25.643
A PROP AND TOP -- AND RIGHT NOW

00:42:25.709 --> 00:42:26.644
YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH A

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:28.279
POSITION -- WHEN I WENT ON THE

00:42:28.345 --> 00:42:28.846
PROJECT I WENT THROUGH MY

00:42:28.913 --> 00:42:29.713
POSITION AND IT WAS A GREAT

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:30.648

00:42:30.714 --> 00:42:32.683
KNOWLEDGEABLE AND NON JUDGMENTAL

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:33.951

00:42:46.897 --> 00:42:47.598
PATIENTS.

00:42:47.665 --> 00:42:49.833
TO GO TO SEE THE DOCTOR AND ASK

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:53.003

GOING ON THE PROP.

00:43:01.578 --> 00:43:03.147
IN ADDITION WE HAVE A PHYSICIAN

00:43:03.213 --> 00:43:05.449

00:43:14.391 --> 00:43:16.226
THE BILL WILL ALLOW --

00:43:37.514 --> 00:43:39.083
FORTH I SAID THIS BILL WITH

00:43:39.149 --> 00:43:40.951

EXACT PURPOSE SO WE JUST WANT TO

00:55:12.108 --> 00:55:12.742
MAKE SURE THAT THE AMENDMENTS DO

00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:13.576
NOT.

00:55:13.643 --> 00:55:14.844
UNINTENTIONALLY NEGATIVELY

00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:16.379
IMPACT THOSE PROGRAMS THAT ARE

00:55:16.446 --> 00:55:17.414
VERY SUCCESSFUL SINCE THERE

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:18.481
SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S SOME NEW

00:55:18.548 --> 00:55:19.649
REQUIREMENTS FOR PHARMACY STILL

00:55:19.716 --> 00:55:21.184

TO DOING THAT -- EN MASSE IT

00:56:49.572 --> 00:56:50.607
WOULD JUST OBSERVE A REAL

00:56:50.673 --> 00:56:53.243
IDENTIFICATION WITH THE PERSONAL --

00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:53.977

00:56:57.013 --> 00:56:58.281
EXPERIENCE OF CLOSE FRIENDS --

00:56:58.348 --> 00:56:59.315
THERE IS A PROBLEM HERE THAT

00:56:59.382 --> 00:57:00.483
THIS LEGISLATURE CAN HELP FIX

00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:02.152
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS

00:57:02.218 --> 00:57:03.553
INTENDED TO DO -- THERE'S BEEN

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:05.121
X. OUTSTANDING REPORTING LAST

00:57:05.188 --> 00:57:07.056

ORIGINS OF THIS MEDICATION --

00:57:08.925 --> 00:57:10.660
WHICH IS THAT WE ALL PAID FOR

00:57:10.727 --> 00:57:12.562
ITS CREATION -- BUT THE LACK OF

00:57:12.629 --> 00:57:14.998
ACCESS TO IT THAT IS HAPPENING

00:57:15.064 --> 00:57:16.933
IN THE REALLY SORT OF COLLECTIVE

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.101
ANGER WE SHOULD HAVE IT THE FACT

00:57:18.168 --> 00:57:20.069
THAT WE HAVE NOT COME FURTHER --

00:57:20.136 --> 00:57:22.272

PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THAT'S

00:57:25.074 --> 00:57:26.075
WHAT YOU'RE BILLS DOING -- SO I

00:57:26.142 --> 00:57:27.143
WOULD ASK EVERY MEMBER OF THIS

00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:28.678

00:57:28.745 --> 00:57:31.114
THIS BILL HELP US ADVANCE IT

00:57:31.181 --> 00:57:32.282
THIS MAY NOT DIRECTLY IMPACT YOU

00:57:32.348 --> 00:57:33.650
ALTHOUGH I WOULD ARGUE HIV IS A

00:57:33.716 --> 00:57:35.819

THAT'S WHAT THIS ORGANIZATION

00:59:35.605 --> 00:59:38.808

THIS DOESN'T CHANGE ANY OF THAT

00:59:56.025 --> 00:59:58.127
ALL IT DOES IS IT GIVES PEOPLE

00:59:58.194 --> 01:00:04.968
AN ADDITIONAL OPTION TO GO TO

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:06.069

INSURER HAD REFUSED TO PAY

02:08:15.754 --> 02:08:16.955
IF I MADE ALL MY PAYMENTS ON

02:08:17.022 --> 02:08:19.258
TIME AND PAID OFF THE BALANCE BY

02:08:19.324 --> 02:08:20.526
THE END OF THE PROMOTIONAL

02:08:20.592 --> 02:08:21.527
PERIOD.

02:08:21.593 --> 02:08:23.429
ALL INTEREST CHARGES WOULD BE

02:08:23.495 --> 02:08:24.863
WAY AND THAT CERTAINLY WAS

02:08:24.930 --> 02:08:26.965
ATTRACTIVE UNTIL I GOT MY FIRST

02:08:27.032 --> 02:08:27.933
BILL.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:29.902
I HAD A SMALL BALANCE AT THE END

02:08:29.968 --> 02:08:31.537
OF THE PROMOTIONAL PERIOD AND

02:08:31.603 --> 02:08:33.672
EXPECTED TO PAY INTEREST ON THAT

02:08:33.739 --> 02:08:36.775
AMOUNT SO WHEN I GOT A BILL OF

02:08:36.842 --> 02:08:38.477
ALMOST A THOUSAND DOLLARS ON

02:08:38.544 --> 02:08:40.813
WHAT WAS A SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR

02:08:40.879 --> 02:08:41.413
BALANCE.

02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:43.215
I CAN FIGURE OUT HAS SYNCHRONY

02:08:43.282 --> 02:08:45.517
JUSTIFIED THREE HUNDRED FORTY

02:08:45.584 --> 02:08:47.386
NINE DOLLARS IN INTEREST ON A

02:08:47.453 --> 02:08:48.454
SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR BALANCE EVEN

02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:51.557
AT TWENTY SIX POINT 99% INTEREST.

02:08:51.623 --> 02:08:54.159
IT TURNS OUT THREE HUNDRED FORTY

02:08:54.226 --> 02:08:55.294
NINE DOLLARS ON THAT BALANCE

02:08:55.360 --> 02:08:56.228
WOULD IT BE AN EFFECTIVE

02:08:56.295 --> 02:09:00.265
INTERESTED FIFTY ONE POINT 7%.

02:09:00.332 --> 02:09:01.400
ALSO I CALLED SYNCHRONY BANK AND

02:09:01.467 --> 02:09:03.502
ASK THEM -- TO EXPLAIN THEIR

02:09:03.569 --> 02:09:04.470
MATH.

02:09:04.536 --> 02:09:05.904
BUT THEY TOLD ME THEY DO MATH

02:09:05.971 --> 02:09:09.274
DIFFERENTLY AT SYNCHRONY SO

02:09:09.341 --> 02:09:10.843
WOULD YOU.

02:09:10.909 --> 02:09:12.444
ESTIMATE YOUR COMMENTS PLEASE.

02:09:12.511 --> 02:09:13.645
YEAH THEY AND THEY SAID THE

02:09:13.712 --> 02:09:14.980
INTEREST WAS CORRECT BASED ON

02:09:15.047 --> 02:09:16.315
THE ORIGINAL BALANCE ON SO I CAN

02:09:16.381 --> 02:09:17.850
UNDERSTAND HOW THAT COULD BE

02:09:17.916 --> 02:09:19.818
BECAUSE I PAID MY MONTHLY BILLS

02:09:19.885 --> 02:09:22.020
ON TIME AND I PAY DOWN THE

02:09:22.087 --> 02:09:23.589
ORIGINAL BALANCE.

02:09:23.655 --> 02:09:24.756
BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER UNLIKE SOME

02:09:24.823 --> 02:09:26.358
OF MY OTHER CREDIT CARDS THAT

02:09:26.425 --> 02:09:29.795
HAVE A 0% PROMOTIONAL INTEREST

02:09:29.862 --> 02:09:30.896
SYNCHRONY HAD A UNIQUE

02:09:30.963 --> 02:09:32.965
DEFINITION OF DEFERRED INTEREST

02:09:33.031 --> 02:09:36.101

02:20:39.597 --> 02:20:41.065
THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE SAVVY

02:20:41.132 --> 02:20:44.002
