NATIONALLY UNACCOMPANIED WOMEN MAKE UP NEARLY ONE IN THREE OF ALL ADULT INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS BUT DESPITE MAKING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS HAVE LARGELY FALLEN THROUGH THE CRACKS.

WITH LITTLE RESOURCES AND NO SHELTER THESE WOMEN FACE A DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT ON THE STREETS. WE AS A LEGISLATURE MUST DO MORE TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S HOMELESS POPPED UP POPULATION.

JUST AS THE REVOLUTION APPEARED TO BE ON THE VERGE OF FAILURE GREAT BRITAIN FRANCE AND RUSSIA INTERVENED IN THE CONFLICT. THE GREEK STRUGGLE HAD ELICITED STRONG SYMPATHY IN EUROPE THE REVOLUTION ENDED IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE WITH THE TREATY OF ETERNAL ESTABLISHING AN INDEPENDENT GREEKS STATE.
