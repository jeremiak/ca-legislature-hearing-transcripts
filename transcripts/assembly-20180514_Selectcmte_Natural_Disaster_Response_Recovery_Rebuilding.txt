YOU KNOW IN ACTUALLY IF IF ON. I DON'T THINK AT THE MEMBERS MIND TO JUST CONFERRED WITH MY MY CO CHAIR WE HAVE THE VICE MAYOR OF SANTA ROSA IF YOU LIKE TO COME UP AND JOIN US THAT BECAUSE. MASTIC. WITH MISTER THOMPSON. WELL FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING US ALL IN FOR. A CONVENING THIS SELECT COMMITTEE. APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH TOM. MORE THINGS BEFORE MACAO MIKE THOMPSON SYSTEM JOURNAL MANAGER WITH THE CINEMA COUNTY WATER AGENCY. I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT. THIS GOING ON SOME OF THE CHALLENGES I KNOW OF PEOPLE ARE FACING IN THE REBUILDING PROCESS AND SOME OF THINGS. THE DID A REFERENCE WE ALL SAID ABOUT HOW WE REBUILD BETTER THAN WE WERE BEFORE AND THAT'S REALLY BEEN A BIG EMPHASIS ON SOMETHING WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON. JUST AS A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND LIKE. LIVED MOST OF MY LIFE AND AND SOME COUNTING SANTA ROSA BUT IT DID LIVE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND ENTER A. AND AND I KNOW. ON DECEMBER FIFTH I WAS LOOKING. FOLLOWING THE TRACK OF THE OF THE THOMAS FIRE AND AND UNFORTUNATELY MY BEST FRIEND DOWN THERE IN THE AREA LOST THEIR HOME. AND SO I'VE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THEM AND WOULD MANY OF THEM I'VE I'VE ASKED EXIT. DIE TALK TO KAREN TODAY AND SAYS I'M SPEAKING BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY WILL WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO TELL THEM. AND SHE HAD AT SOME SOME. THE AND WOULD HAVE NOTICE WITH REGARD TO THE THE CHALLENGES. A LOT OF IT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU ARE IN YOUR JOURNEY. WE IN CINEMA COUNTY WERE A COUPLE MONTHS AHEAD OF. VENTURA IN THE THAT THE JOURNEY OF MANY OF THE PROPERTY OWNERS AND SO. WHAT? MY FRIEND KAREN SAID FIRST WELL SHE WANTED ME TO PASS ON MY APPRECIATION TO YOU ALL FOR THE WORK YOU'VE DONE ON INSURANCE. THE THE FACT THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO GET SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THEIR ITEMIZED OF THEIR CONTENTS WITHOUT HAPPENED ITEMIZED. WAS HUGE. I KNOW THAT FOR MANY FRIENDS AFTER THEY LOST THEIR HOMES THEY WERE. YOU KNOW FINDING NEW PLACES TO LIVE AND JUST THE WHOLE FACT OF YOU LOST YOUR HOME YOU'RE LIVING IN A HOUSE. WHERE EVERY MOVEMENT TAKES THOUGHT WERE LIKE? WHERE WHY HOW DO WE GET TO THE KITCHENWHERE DID I PUT WEARS EVERYTHING PUT IT HITCHED CRISIS MENTAL FATIGUE AND IN ADDITION TO THAT? THEY WERE HAVING TO GO THROUGH ITEMIZING EVERYTHING THEY HAD LOST WHICH IS. WHICH WAS TOP AND SO. JUST WANT TO PASS ON FROM FOR MANY OF THE APPRECIATION TO ALL OF YOU FOR. ESSENTIALLY. LEARNING FROM WHAT WE WENT THROUGH IN CINEMA AND AND FIXING THAT THE REGARD TO THAT MAY NOT SEEM LIKE. A LITTLE THING BUT IT WAS REALLY HUGE TWO A LOT OF THE THE PEOPLE I TALKED WITH JUST TO HAVE THAT MENTAL SPACE AND IT. REALLY HELPED THEM USE THAT ENERGY FOR ELSEWHERE. THERE WAS THE AND I'M SURE IF YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT THE CONCERNS ABOUT. PIC FOLKS BEING PIT PROPERTY OWNERS BEING UNDER INSURED THAT IS A VERY REAL ISSUE WE HAD ONE OF OUR A WATER AGENTS COLLEAGUES. ACTUALLY. TWO DAYS BEFORE THE FIRE THEY HAD. GOTTEN THEIR DOCUMENTS AND THEY'VE. SUCCESSFULLY UPDATED INCREASE OUR FIRE INSURANCE. AND THERE'S POINTED THOUSAND DOLLARS. UNDER FUNDED. A MUCH OF THE THE ISSUE I THINK WE'RE SEEING IS THE FACT THAT MANY OF THESE A POLICIES. THEY ARE PERFECTLY REASONABLE IF YOU. IF ONE HOUSE BURNS. BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A WHOLE COMMUNITY BURN AND THE THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION GOES UP FIFTY PERCENT. THAT NO LONGER WORKS AND THAT'S A THAT'S A I THINK YOU'VE HEARD OTHERS BUT THAT'S A. VERY REAL CHALLENGE TO THEM. THE. THE OTHER. THAT WE'VE HEARD WITH REGARD TO THE BEAT REBUILDING PROCESS AT. THE POINT THEY ARE IN THEIR JOURNEY IS IS FINDING A PROFESSIONAL SERVICES SURVEYING GEOTECHNICAL STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS ARCHITECTS. YOU KNOW OUR COMMUNITY WASN'T READY THAT. FOUR FIFTY THREE HUNDRED HOUSES TO GO AND FOR THE SERVICES. DOT SO THAT'S THAT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE TO BUT THEIR THEY'RE WORKING THROUGH THEIR WAY THROUGH THOSE AND JUST WANTED TO PASS ON THOSE. A WITH REGARD TO THE CINEMA COUNTY WATER AGENCY WE HAVE BEEN. WORKING WITH MANY DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES ON. ON ENCOURAGING AND FINDING WAYS TO ALLOW THEM TO REBUILD. BETTER THAN THEY WERE BEFORE. SO IN ONE AREAS AND ACTUALLY GO THROUGHOUT ALL THE AREAS WERE ENCOURAGING. SYSTEMS THAT WILL INCREASE FLOOD RESILIENCY LA DROUGHT RESILIENCY. AND AND AND FIRE RESILIENCY AS WELL ENERGY. LESS ENERGY SO WE'VE GOT WE'VE TOWARD DEVELOPING LANDSCAPE PLANS FOR DROUGHT TOLERANT LANDSCAPES ROLE THE AREAS THAT HAVE TO BE REBUILT. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT ALSO GRADING PLANS FOR STORM WATER CAPTURE SO THAT HOUSE WATER RUNS OFF OF THESE PROPERTIES THEY DON'T JUST RUN OFF INTO THE STREET AND. INTO A FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL THEY STAY ON THE PROPERTY AND THEY INFILTRATE RECHARGE THE GROUNDWATER TRYING TO RECONNECT. THE THE THE WATERSHED. THAT THAT'S BEEN DISCONNECTED IN THE PAST. ONE OF THE MORE. SOMEWHAT INNOVATIVE AREAS WE'VE WORKED ON THIS ONE COMMUNITY THAT IS REALLY A IT'S AN URBAN FISTS. COMMUNITY BUT THEY'RE ALL ON SEPT EX. AND MANY OF THEM WANTED TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT. AND I'M NOT. TOM. I'M NOT JUST SAYING THIS BECAUSE THESE ARE CHAIR BUT A BUT. I REALLY DON'T AND YOU KNOW THAT. BUT JAMES HAS BEEN ONE THAT IS REALLY ENCOURAGED US TO BE BOLD TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX AND HOW WE COULD. HELP COMMUNITIES REBUILD AND SO. WE'VE WE FOUND A WAY TO. WHAT THAT THAT THE WATER AGENCY WE'VE HAD SOME FUNDING TO WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY DISH? INSTALLED A NEW SEWER SYSTEM IN ONE OF THESE AND ONE OF THE COMMUNITIES. THAT NEEDS IT AND DEVELOPED A FINANCING PROGRAM THAT BY WHICH. ESSENTIALLY THE PROPER MANNERS. JOHN THAT. AND THEN AFTERTEN YEARS THEY WOULD START UP BUT A TWENTY YEAR LOW INTEREST LOAN THE IDEA BEING THAT. A LOT OF WITH EVERYTHING ALL DIESE FIRE SURVIVORS ARE DEALING WITH. WE WANTED THAT KIND OF LET THAT WAVE OF REBUILDING AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT GOES WITH THAT PASS. SO THEY CAN GET THE SYSTEMS AND AND THEN TEN YEARS FROM NOW WHEN THINGS HAVE SETTLED DOWN THEY WOULD BE READY BUT. THAT IS SOMETHING WE'RE PROPOSING A MIDDLE BE GOING TO OUR BOARD ON ON ON JUNE FIFTH BUT. THE. BUT AGAIN WORK WERE REALLY WORKING TO FIND WAYS TO REBUILD BETTER THAN WE WERE BEFORE. WE SEE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE OUR OUR COMMUNITIES MUCH MORE RESILIENT AND ALL FICKLE JUST FALL ALRIGHT THERE'D BE GLAD TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. LATER. TAKE VERY MUCH MISTER THOMPSON SURPRISED OR. YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S A PLEASURE. WHEN HE WAS JAMES GORHAM. CINEMA COUNTY SUPERVISOR SUCH OF OUR BOARD THIS YEAR BUT TO AT THE SAME TIME I'VE. WE'VE RECENTLY CREATED TO SEE SACCADE FORTY STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES A RESILIENT COUNTIES ADVISORY BOARD. WHICH HAS MEMBERS FROM. ON BOTH THE YEAH THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE JUST OUTSIDE AND ALSO THE COUNTY. EXCUSE ME ELECTED OFFICIAL SIDE THROUGHOUT THE Y. GEOGRAPHY OF. OF CALIFORNIA IN SO I'M HERE INCOME OF TWO DIFFERENT AREAS ONE IS TO COME TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON WHERE ROUTE WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM. THE TWO WHAT IS THE THE SYSTEM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SET UP WITH COUNTIES AROUND THE STATE TO BE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH YOU AND YOUR WORK. AND I MEAN THAT VERY DIRECTLY BECAUSE AS YOU ALL KNOW MANY OF YOU COMING FROM STATE TO STATE GOVERNMENT OR OTHER DIFFERENT AREAS ARE HAVING CLOSE CONNECTIONS TO THEIR. VOWS. AS YOUR DIRECTOR OF OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES KILLER DUDE SHE LIKES TO SAY AS YOU KNOW ALL ALL DISASTER START LOCAL IN AND LOCAL. HOWEVER. WHAT'S IN THE MIDDLE RIGHT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S IN THE MIDDLE YOU GUYS HAVE STEPPED UP IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET A STEPPED UP. YOU KNOW WE HAVE FELT THE LOVE IN TERMS OF NOT LEAVING US ASTRAY I MEAN THE AMOUNT OF. IF IF I LOOK AT WHAT YOU ALL OF HANDED OUT. YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF NATURAL DISASTER RESPONSE LITIGATION. LITIGATION I'M GOT LOST ON THAT TO PASS A SLAVE AND AT. THAT YEAH THERE TO LEGISLATION WORK WERE IN THIS PLACE WHERE YOU ALL ARE SPONSORING SUFFERS WITH RESPECT TO INSURANCE. ARE TRYING TO FIX ISSUES THAT HAVE COME UP REGARDING. YOU KNOW PRICE GOUGING OF UNKNOWN UNKNOWN ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD ON THAT YOU KNOW AND THEN WE LOOK AT THE BUDGET AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IS THAT. IF WE ARE LEFT ON OUR OWN UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES EVEN WITH SIGNIFICANT GENERAL FUND RESERVES IN OUR AREAS. WE ARE DEALING WITH CATACLYSMIC KIND OF SITUATION OF NOT BEING ABLE TO OPERATE GENERAL DAY TO DAY SERVICES IF WE CAN'T. BUT THE BIG FOCUS FOR ME HAS TO BE THE NEW NORMAL AND ALL OF YOU RIGHT. IS THAT HERE WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE IF YOU LOOK THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. IS AT EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN OUT OF THREE THOUSAND AND SIXTY NINE COUNTIES WERE UNDER MAJOR DISASTER DECLARATION THAT'S MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. IF YOU LOOK OF ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO WITH THE DROUGHT THAT'S MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF THE COUNTIES THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES HUNDRED MAJOR DISASTER DECLARATION. SO THESE ARE NOT DISASTROUS ANYMORE RIGHT THE OUR WHAT WE OPERATE UNDER AND IF YOU LOOK AT YOU AND WHEN I TALKED WITH YOUR EMERGENCY MANAGER DOWN THERE IN YOUR AREA HE'S TALKING ABOUT. SIX DISASTER DECLARATIONS IN THREE YEARS FOR TALK ABOUT NAPA SAME NUMBERS. WERE AT SIX IN THREE AND A HALF YEARS A WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH IS THIS IS BECOME A PART OF OUR NORMAL OPERATING BUSINESS. AND SO PART OF YOUR NORMAL BUDGETING IS WAITING FOR FEMA TO PAY YOU BACK ON SAYING SO YOU'RE ALSO WAITING ON ON DIFFERENT NUMBERS COMING IN. YOU'RE YOU'RE LOOKING AT ASSESSMENTS THEN ALL SUDDEN YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH LIKE GRANTS LIKE HAUSER MITIGATION GRANT PROGRAM APPLICATIONS THAT COME UP. WHICH SEEM LIKE A LOT OF MONEY BUT YOU GOTTA PUT A QUARTER OF THE MONEY ON THE TABLE. I MEAN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A MAJOR FULL COURT DIFFERENCE AND EVERYBODY WHO IS HIRED FOR WHAT I WOULD CALL. COUNTY OR CITY OR CITY OPERATIONS WERE REALLY HIRED FOR DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS THEY WERE NOT HIRED IN ME INCLUDED BEING ELECTED TO BANISH THE NEW NORMAL. AND THAT'S WHERE WE REALLY ASK FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP RIGHT IT'S SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE OUR FIRST MEETING OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES RESILIENT COUNTIES ADVISORY BOARD. OUT OUR LEDGE CONFERENCE THIS WEEK. CAN OUR GOAL IS TO FOLLOW UP ON WHATEVER THINGS THAT YOU NEED WHETHER IT'S INPUT FROM US OR WHETHER IT'S AS A DELIVERY MECHANISM. IN BUILDING OUR HOUSE OR MITIGATION PLANS. I MEAN OBVIOUSLY MORE RESOURCES ARE NEEDED. IN ONE OF THE WAYS YOU CAN THINK ABOUT THIS IS THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT ALONE. SO NO MY COUNTY RIGHT INCLUDING CITY OF SANTA ROSA AND US. NINE HUNDRED TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND DEBRIS REMOVAL MONEY SPENT. THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY WE WOULD HAVE HAD TO SPEND TO REALLY FOCUS ON UPSTREAM MANAGEMENT OF OUR FORESTS. AND GETTING INTO THE WORLD WHERE WE DIDN'T STAVE OFF THAT NATURAL CYCLE WITH FIRES AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE NEED TO MANAGE TO BE ABLE TO BE SMARTER AND PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES. THIS IS REALLY A CALLING I FEEL FOR MANY OF US RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE DEAL WITH PERSONAL PROBLEMS EACH AND EVERY DAY. AND THEN WE GET SMACKED IN THE FACE BY A WILDFIRE. LAKE COUNTY THREE YEARS IN A ROW FIVE FIRES RIGHT SO I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO ACT EVEN AS WE REBUILD IS HOW WHO YOU SIT HERE AND EXPECT THE INEVITABLE TO COME. AND GET ARE PEOPLE READY. SO. DEBRIS REMOVAL NINETY NINE PERCENT DONE. THE PUBLIC PROGRAM O. WORKS VERY WELL FOR US FOR US IT WAS ARDUOUS THOUGH FOR PEOPLE WHOSE THE FIRST CHOICE THEY HAD TO MAKE. POST FIRES RIGHT AND THEN IT WAS LIKE OH DO I GO THEME ARE PRIVATE WHERE THE GOVERNMENT. SECONDLY PEOPLE ARE DRASTICALLY UNDER INSURED IF I COULD GIVE ONE ONE STICK TO THIS IT WOULD BE. AS MUCH AS YOU ALL DEAL WITH THE SPECIFICITY OF HOW MUCH PEOPLE SHOULD BE INSURED BY OTHER THINGS. JUST FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT THERE'S NO COMMON PARLANCE. IN THESE POLICIES THERE'S NO STANDARDIZATION OF EVEN HOW THEY USE WORDS SO THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW IT EVEN THE SAME PEOPLE WITH STATE FARMER FARMERS OR WHATEVER OUR TRYING TO BECOME EXPERTS ON INSURANCE LAW. AND WHAT IT MEANS AND HOW THEY DEAL WITH EVEN TO THE HIGHER THIRD PARTY ADJUSTER TO BE AN INTERFACE AND GIVEN TEN PERCENT SO THAT I DON'T HAVE TO SPEND THIRTY HOURS A WEEK DOING THIS. YOU NO. WITH RESPECT TO REBUILD. A LET THE DEVICE MAYOR TALK ABOUT THIS BUT IN COFFEE PARKING AREA THAT WE HAVE JOINT JURISDICTION BUT YOUR LAND USE AND IT'S IN THE CITY. MORE THAN SIXTY HOUSES RISING UP IT'S PRETTY INSPIRING. BUT THERE'S A LOTTA LOTS THAT ARE SPECULATIVE IN ON THE MARKET OVER ON OUR SIDE ON THE COUNTY. LARKFIELD WIKI UP AREAS COMING ALONG ABOUT THE SAME ROUTE BUT. BUT THE HILLS ARE SLOWER RIGHT TO HILLS ARE SLOWER COST GOING UP INTO THOSE AREAS. ALERT MORNINGS WE'RE GONNA GO OUT WITH A. BASICALLY AT WE HAVE TO NOTIFY THE. THE FCC. THER FORTY FIVE DAYS BEFORE WE DO A COUNTY WIDE NOTICE WE'RE GONNA WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS WERE REQUESTING TO BE ABLE TO DO ONE. IN EARLY SEPTEMBER AND WE'RE AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE A JUNE TWENTY JUNE ELEVENTH BOARD MEETING TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO. BASICALLY THAT THE TECH. BECAUSE IT IS BUYING LIKE SOFTWARE PROGRAMS. IF YOU BUY SO COOLER DOES IT WORK BETTER THE NEXT HOLE DOES NOT WORK LIKE THIS. BUT FOR YOU ALL YOU TALKED ABOUT IT. COMMON PARLANCE INVER* AND HOW YOU ALERT IS IMPORTANT. WE HAD SOMEBODY ON A RESILIENT COUNTIES TASK FORCE FROM LA COUNTY SAID YOU THINK IT'S HARD. WE HAVE IN OUR COUNTY EIGHTY CITIES IN OVER A HUNDRED SPECIAL DISTRICTS. SO HOW DO WE ALERT PEOPLE WITH ALL THESE AUTHORITIES TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. FINAL THING I IS IS FEMALE WE ARE YOU KNOW THERE'S A BIG AREA OF. OF THE BEST ACRONYM IN THE WORLD HUD CBG DR. HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE DEVELOP BLOCK GRANTS DISASTER RECOVERY DOLLARS BUT TO LEARN TWELVE MILLION TAG FOR CALIFORNIA FOR WORKING WITH YOUR FOLKS LIKE BEEN METCALF AND OTHERS. TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT SANTA ROSA IN CINEMA COUNTY AS ENTITLEMENT COMMUNITIES WHICH WE MEANS WE USUALLY MANAGE OUR OWN CBG MONEY. WANT TO SET THAT UP AS THE TO GET ON THE GROUND AND AND PASS THROUGHS BUT WE ARE ALSO HAVING TO HIRE DISASTER CONSULTANTS TO HELP US DO THAT. BECAUSE AS YOU ALL OR IS HEARD THEY WOULD SAY WELL WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO GIVE GIVE ME TO GIVE YOU A HUNDRED MILLION. IF YOU NORMALLY ONLY MANAGED TO YOU GOT TO SHOW US THAT YOU CAN MANAGE A HUNDRED. SO THAT'S WHERE YOU GET INTO THIS WORLD OF CONSULTANTS AND OTHERS. ALERT MORNINGS I WAS ON A PANEL WITH DOS WILLIAMS RECENTLY. YOU KNOW WE'VE GOTTEN CRITICIZED FOR NOT DOING ENOUGH WARNINGS AND I WOULD SAY WE NEED TO DO BETTER WE HAVE TO OWN THAT. ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU ALL HAD I THINK FROM WHAT HE SAID FIFTEEN PERCENT COMPLIANCE TO A MANDATORY EVACUATION. UP. ON THE MUD SLIDES. FIFTEEN PERCENT COMPLIANCE SO THIS IS ABOUT REDUNDANCY OF SYSTEMS IS THE ONLY TIME I'VE HEARD THE WORD REDUNDANCY USED IN A POSITIVE WAY. RIGHT IS LIKE SO WHAT ARE WE DOING YOU KNOW COPE CERTEON MISS CITIZENS ORGANIZING TO PREPARE FOR EMERGENCIES. COMMUNITY EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS LIKE IN MARIN THAT ARE VERY PRODUCTIVE. THE REASON A LOT OF THESE HAVEN'T DEVELOPED INTO REALLY GOOD NETWORKS IS BECAUSE. OF THE FEAR OF LIABILITY LIKE. WE CAN'T POSSIBLY TRAIN PEOPLE TO BE PREPARED FOR EMERGENCIES COUSIN AT THE BEGINNING A CERTIFICATE WE CAN GET SUED IF THEY DON'T RESPOND IN THE RIGHT WAY. THAT'S THE STUFF THAT THAT UNITES I'D SAY AND AND REALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THESE CERTAIN COPE TEAMS AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO I'VE ABOUT A. A NETWORK OF ABOUT TEN THAT WERE STARTING AND WERE ALREADY ON GOING IN NORTH COUNTY. THEY'RE SITTING THERE JUST TO INCLUDE ALL FASHION COMMUNITY ORGANIZING. THERE'S LIKE A LOW. I MISS OUT YEAR CURRY YOU OF AN ELDERLY MOM ON YOUR PROPERTY YOU KNOW MISLI MON YOU HAVE A WATER. TENDER ON YOUR PROPERTY HOW DO WE IF THE GRID DROPS LIKE IN OUR CASE WERE SEVENTY FOUR CELL TOWERS WENT DOWN. FIRST NIGHT. AND IF YOU DON'T EVEN EVEN IF WE HAVE A SYSTEM FOR ALERTING COULD YOU CALL. RIGHT SO THE TRENDS ARE OUT THERE AND I JUST WANNA REALLY THANK YOU ALL FROM THE FROM THE ASPECT OF. C. SACK OUR GOAL IS TO REALLY IS TO REALLY BE ABLE TO WORK WITH YOU IN YOUR COMMITTEE AND THE OTHERS TO SAY. IS THAT FORCE MANAGEMENT THAT WE WANT TO THAT WE CAN BE A PART OF DO WE NEED IMPLEMENTED INTO OUR GENERAL PLAN. YOU KNOW WHAT IS IT THAT WE NEED TO DO SO THAT WE CAN MAKE IT NOT ABOUT SO NO MY COUNTY HAVING NOT LEARNED ITS LESSON FROM SANTA BARBARA SAN DIEGO OAKLAND. AND NOW WE GO THROUGH IT AND EVERYONE ELSE IS DOING THE SAME THING. SO REALLY HOPE THAT YOU GUYS CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN HELP YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SUPERVISOR MISS MINNESOTA. THANK YOU. I HAVE A QUICK PARA POINT I'M GONNA GO TO JUST BECAUSE I THINK VISUALS A HELP. SO THANK YOU AGAIN OF FOR INVITING US HERE TODAY AYE MONNING USE ON OF THE COUNTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR SANTA BARBARA. AND I THE SUPERVISOR ARTICULATED EVERYTHING EXCEPTIONALLY WELL MY. COMMENTS ARE BASICALLY REFLECTION OF THAT. ALSO WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMON BECAUSE I HAVE TO LET EVERYONE KNOW DURING THE DISASTER SHE WAS IN THE OAK EEOC WITH US ALMOST EVERY YEAR ON THE PHONE WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT DEBRIS FLOWS BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THOSE ARE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS IT'S SOMETHING WE DON'T TALK ABOUT SOME FLOOD IT'S NOT A MUD SLIDE. IT'S NOT IN OUR VERNACULAR. AND SO JUST QUICKLY WANT TO JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DEBRIS FLOW BECAUSE THE DEBRIS FLOW AS A RESULT OF THE FIRE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT COUNTY OTHER PLACES YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT MUDSLIDES AND DEBRIS FLOWS AND I WANT TO. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT REALLY HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON HOW WE'RE RECOVERING. SO OUR DEBRIS FLOW HAPPENED ON JANUARY NINTH AND WE'VE BEEN CALLING IT A GENUINE NIGHT DEBRIS FLOW WE HAD OVER FIVE HUNDRED STRUCTURES DESTROYED AND DAMAGE WAS DONE OVER TWO HUNDRED RED TAG. THEIR TWENTY THREE PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES WERE LOST ARE STILL MISSING. WHEN I ONE WHICH IS OUR LIFEBLOOD CONNECTED TO THE REST OF THE WORLD WAS CLOSED FOR ALMOST TWO WEEKS WE'VE HAD BRIDGES. DESTROYED PEOPLE STILL CAN'T RIVERS AND WE HAD UTILITIES OUT. SO WHAT CAUSATIVE REFLOW FIRST OF ALL IT HAD THREE THINGS FIRE. STEEPNESS OF THE MOUNTAINS BEHIND US AND AN INTENSE RAIN. AND WHAT A DEBRIS FLOW WAS YOU CAN SEE BY LOOKING AT THESE PICTURES OOPS. IS THAT IT WAS A WHOLE TORRENT OF BOULDERS OF MUD. TREES OF ROCKS AT JUST GUSHED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN. VERY QUICKLY. UP ABOVE THE FROM THE FEDERAL LAND ABOVE US IT OVERTOPPED ELEVEN OF OUR DEBRIS BASINS OF THESE DEBRIS BASINS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL FIELDS. CONTINUE TO FILL OUR STREAMS AND CHANNELS EXPLODED INTO THE NEIGHBOR NEIGHBORHOODS A CARRIED WITH IT SUV'S HOUSES. HUNDRED YEAR OLD TREES BRIDGES. UTILITY POLES THAT WERE BOBBING UP AND DOWN IN THE DEBRIS FLOW. AND SO. IT CAME TOGETHER. LIKE I SAID BECAUSE OF THE STEEPNESS OF THE FORCE MOUNTAINS THIS INTENSE RAIN AND THE HOT THE HEAT OF THE FIRE. SORT CHALLENGES THAT AS WE ARE RECOVERING FROM THE DISASTER. WE ARE STILL IN TO DISASTER BECAUSE THE MOUNDS ABOVE US ARE NOT GOING TO RE VEGETATE FOR ANOTHER THREE TO FIVE YEARS. AND THE SCIENTISTS HAVE TOLD US WE ARE STILL AT RISK. SO I'M LIKE A FIRE WHERE THERE'S A THREAT WE RECOVER IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY HAS HAD TONS OF FIRES WERE STILL UNDER THREAT WHILE WE ARE IN RECOVERY. AND TEAMS OF SCIENTISTS HAVE GOTTEN TOGETHER AND THANK YOU TO THE STATE THE CALIFORNIA GEOLOGIC SURVEY CAL FIRE THE U. S. FOR SERVICE THE STATE WATERSHED TASK FORCE THEY ALL CAME TOGETHER AND HELPED US. COLLABORATE TO PUT TOGETHER OUR RISK AND OR DEBRIS FLOW MAPS AFTER THE FIRE BECAUSE EVERYONE YOU AFTER THIS FIRE WE ARE AT RISK FOR SOME KIND OF. OTHER DISASTER. IT'S A RESPONSE WE DEVELOPED. AFTER THE DISASTER SEVENTY TWO OUR PROTOCOL TO ALERT RESIDENTS WHEN IT RAINS TRIGGERED SUCH THAT IT WOULD TRIGGER. POTENTIAL OTHER DEBRIS FLOW AND THIS PAST WINTER WE HAD TO EVACUATE PEOPLE THREE TIMES AFTER THE DEBRIS FLOW. BECAUSE THE RAIN REACHED A CERTAIN THRESHOLD AT TIMES IS TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT WE HAD TO EVACUATE AND ACOSTA TWO HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH TIME IN PUBLIC SAFETY COSTS. IT WASN'T JUST THIS AREA OF MODESTY TO ITS BEING AND ALL THE AREAS OF THE FOOTHILLS SO MUCH YOU KNOW CARPENTER IN UNINCORPORATED AREAS. OF THE COUNTY AGAIN A SCIENTIST WE JUST HAVE A PRESENTATION TO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SAID YOU'RE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET. BECAUSE THEY HIT THE FIRE WAS SO HOT THE VEGETATION IS GOING TO TAKE. THREE TO FIVE YEARS TO COME BACK AND HELP PREVENT AM FOR THE DEBRIS FLOWS. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT REBUILDING. AND SOME OF OUR CHALLENGES SO WE HAVE THE TYPICAL CHALLENGES AS WE TALK ABOUT FROM FIRE AND THEN A MISTER NYGAARD ALLEN CONSTRUCTION TALK ABOUT MORE ABOUT WHAT HE SEEN IN THE FIELD. BUT ENSURE WE HAVE SEVERELY DAMAGED AREAS WHERE THERE'S NO LONGER THE SAME PARCEL LINES. THE LOT LINES HAVE MOVED AND SO THE SURVEY MONUMENTS OF DISAPPEARED BACK REDUCE ESTABLISHING NEW SURVEY MONUMENTS IN SOME AREAS SO. HOMES OR NEAR A CREEK. OUR CHANNEL ARE NOW IN THE CREEK CHANNEL. AS CHRIS OF WIDENED AND DEEPENED. ESTIMATES COMING OUT THIS SUMMER WITH THE HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD MAPS OF THAT WILL NO BETTER WHERE. OUR RESIDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO. PREBUILT. I'M WE'VE ASSIGNED CASE MANAGERS TO HOMEOWNERS WHERE YOU KNOW THREE MONTHS BEHIND EVERYONE ELSE MEANT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA LIKELY THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS HAVE A LOCAL CHAPTER OF THE VOLUNTEER THEIR TIME FRY PRIVATE FIRMS HAVE VOLUNTEERED THEIR TIME BECAUSE OUR SING WITH THE CHALLENGE. HOW DO YOU REBUILD THESE KINDS OF AREAS SO THEY'RE GIVING A RESIDENTS ADVICE LOOKING OUT THE TOPOGRAPHY IS CHANGED IN FACT THERE WAS A WORKSHOP THIS WEEKEND WITH THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS GROUP AND SOME OF OUR RESIDENTS? AND AS WE'VE HEARD MANY RESIDENTS ARE UNDER INSURED HER DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INSURANCE I ASKED WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE OUT THERE THEY SAID IT'S A PATCHWORK. NOT THE SAME VOCABULARY PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHEN SOME INSURANCE COVERAGE COSTS AND OTHERS DON'T. SOME HAVE STARTED TO MILL DEMOLITION OTHERS HAVE NOT SO IT IS A WHOLE PATCHWORK OUT. AND AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE PHOTOS WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF MUD AND DEBRIS ON MANY OF OUR PROPERTIES SO I'M LIKE A FIRE. WHERE THERE'S DEBRIS IN ASH AND ATTACH IT IS MATERIAL THAT THE STATE OR A WILL REMOVE THIS IS MUD? AND IT'S REALLY THE TOPSOIL FROM THE FORESTS A ABOVE US SO IT'S NOT HAZARDOUS MATERIAL AND AGAIN IT'S BEEN A VERY COSTLY FOR PEOPLE TO REMOVE. WE'VE ENCOURAGE RESIDENTS IN FACT TO KEEP IT ON SITE UNTIL WE KNOW A BIT MORE ABOUT REBUILDING POSSIBILITIES BECAUSE THEY MAY HAVE TO USE IT TO CHANGE THE ELEVATION OF GRADING ON THEIR PROPERTIES. WE'VE INTRODUCED. SON THIS RECENTLY IN WAS CALLED ARE A COUPLE MONTHS AGO AND IT'S AN EXCHANGE PROGRAM LIKE A CRAIGSLIST FOR HOMEOWNERS CAN POST THEIR SOIL AND ROCKS. AND OTHER PEOPLE CAN SAY THEY THEY WANNA AND THEY'LL COME AND PICK IT UP SO LANDSCAPE COMPANIES ARE MAKING USE OF THE ROCKS FROM RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES. FARMERS AND WINERIES ARE COMING TO IMPORT THE SENTIMENT FOR THEIR USE FOR THEIR PROPERTIES. SOME OF THE REST OF THE DEBRIS GOES HAVE GONE TO PRIVATE LANDFILLS SOME TO OUR LANDFILL. ANOTHER ISSUE I KNOW THAT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES HAVE BUT LANDFILLS. WE'RE REACHING OUR CAPACITY IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE STATE AGENCIES TO TALK ABOUT THAT WE APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSIONS AND WILL CONTINUE DO THAT BECAUSE IF WE HAVE ANOTHER DEBRIS FLOW. WE ARE WORD VIRGEN EITHER PARK PASADENA. IN A LANDFILL. SO I'M TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE REBUILDING THEIR. SO THIS IS JUST A PICTURE OF ONE OF THE. OTHER DEBRIS BASINS IN THERE'S ELEVEN ANSWER BEFORE THE THE. DEBRIS FLOW THESE THIS WAS CLEARED OUT THIS IS RIGHT AFTER THE DEBRIEF AND YOU CAN SEE IT'S COMPLETELY FILLED AND ACTUALLY OVERTOPPED. IT COSTS THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS WHO WERE MISSION TASK DO THIS A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO CLEAR UP DEBRIS. IT'S SO JUST LIKE. THAT ON CALIFORNIA COUNTIES WE HAVE A A LOCAL SHARE OF THOSE COSTS WILL BE ASKING THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR WAIVER NOW THAT WE KNOW THAT DISCIPLINE OF THE CALIFORNIA. COUNTIES GONE AWAY FROM THEIR LOCAL MATCH. WE HAD DAMAGES TO OUR DEBRIS BASINS ROADS BRIDGES CULVERTS. AND AND LIKE I SAID WE HAD SIX BRIDGES THAT WERE DAMAGED ONLY TO UNDER CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON SHORT LONG TERM. SOLUTIONS. LIKE CAN WE BRACE THE HILL OTHER ENGINEERING THINGS WE CAN DO TO KEEP THE ROCKS UP THERE. CAN EXPAND AND FORTIFY THE DEBRIS BASINS CAN WE CREATE MORE OPEN SPEAK SPACE NEAR THE CREEK SO THEY COME BECOME NATURAL DEBRIS BASINS ARE WIDEN THE CULVERTS ARE STILL LOOKING AT ALL THAT. WILL BE SUBMITTING THINGS TO THE STATE BE MATH WERE HOME HAZARD MITIGATION PROGRAM. LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT WHAT TO BROUGH BASINS ARE BLIND SO MUCH ABOUT THEM AND REALLY BECAUSE. AM I HAVE TO HAND IT TO CAL FIRE IN MY STAFF AND OH YES YOU JUST SAID AS THE FIRE WAS STILL BURNING THEY SAID WE NEED TO CLEAR OUT THE DEBRIS BASINS. BECAUSE IF IT RAINS WE'RE GONNA HAVE A PROBLEM. AND THEY DID THAT MAY SAVE MANY LIVES BECAUSE OF THAT. WE TALK ABOUT FINANCIALLY WE. WE A HAD A PROPERTY TAX IMPACT LIKE THE OTHER COUNTIESAN INVOLVED. BUT VERMONT ACETO SO EVERYONE THINKS OF HONESTY DOES THE RICH RICHER. OF IT'S A SMALL AREA OF OUR COUNTY IT'S ONLY POINT TWO PERCENT OF THE WHOLE LAND AREA. BUT IT MAKES UP SEVENTEEN PERCENT OF OUR PROPERTY TAX BASE. IT HAS SIXTY PERCENT OVER SIXTY PERCENT OF THE TOT FOR COUNTY GOVERNMENT. SO ALL WALL SO WE HAD A DROP OF ONE POINT THREE BILLION JUST FOR THE SOLE AREA MONTESINOS IT'S COMPLETELY IT'S AFFECTED OUR GENERAL FUND REVENUE. IT'S AFFECTED THEM THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS AS WELL AGAIN AFFECTED OUR TOT BECAUSE THOSE HOTELS ARE STILL OUT OF COMMISSION. WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE COUNT THE GOVERNOR FOR INCLUSION LOS TAXES AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK THROUGH OUR LOCAL DELEGATION ON SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. THE CHALLENGE WE FACE IS THAT OKAY WE HAVE THIS DEBRIS BASIN. AS A RESULT THE TOP OF THIS DEBRIS FLOW AS A RESULT OF THE THOMAS FIRE SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. IF WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE IS FEMA GONNA BE THERE AGAIN FOR US. THIS CALLAWAY THAT'S GOING TO BE THERE FOR US THEY'VE BEEN GREAT PARTNERS BUT FOR US THIS INVENT IS NOT CLOSED AS WE ARE STILL IN AN OPEN EMERGENCY. AND WE WILL BE SO OUR RESIDENTS ARE COUNTIES LIVING WITH THIS THREAT AND UNCERTAINTY UNTIL THE HILL STREET DO RE VEGETATE. WE DON'T LOT THOUGH AS FAR AS RESILIENCY ART IT'S REALLY AMAZING HOW PEOPLE HAVE A STEP FORWARD. HOW THAT'S PART VERNACULAR NOW? AFTER FEMA'S DISASTER RECOVERY CENTER CLOSED UP SHOP WE OPEN UP OUR OWN AND MY SEAT OVER IN THE HEART OF THE COMMERCIAL DISTRICT. AT THE CENTER PEOPLE RECEIVE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT THEY SPEAK TO CRISIS COUNSELORS. TALK ABOUT GRANTS IN BOTH SPANISH AND ENGLISH THEY GET DOCUMENTATION FOR INSURANCE WE HAVE ALL OUR NON PROFITS HOUSE THERE WERE THIRTY FIVE NON PROFITS OF COME TOGETHER. A WE DO NEWSLETTERS AND. COMMUNITY MEETINGS. WE EVEN HAVE A NONPROFIT COMMUNITY GROUP THAT STEPPED UP CALLED THE PARTNERS FOR RESOLVING COMMUNITIES A FUNDED COUNTY SERVICES AND. OTHER ONE BE A MODEL FOR PRIVATE PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS HAVE BEEN REALLY HELPING OUT OF PROVIDING MONEY FOR EXPERTISE THAT WE NECESSARILY COULDN'T FUND. AND THE WHOLE COMMUNITY COME TOGETHER FOR CAMPAIGN. ANNA BENEFIT CONCERTS ON A LOT OF PEOPLE HEARD ABOUT THAT SO WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE THERE'S EVEN CYNICAL THE BUCKET FOR GRADE. A BUNCH OF FOLKS HAVE COME TOGETHER TO HELP PEOPLE A TAKE THE DEBRIS IN THE DIRT OFF OF THEIR PROPERTY. SO IN CONCLUSION WE. ARE MAKING PROGRESS ON RECOVERY IT'S SLOW A WE'LL KNOW MORE ONCE WE GET OUR NEW FEMA MAPS. IN THERE ARE SOME ASKS THAT WE HAVE. AGENCIES AMOUNTS THAT ONE WE NEED NEW LIGHT ARE MAPPING THE LIGHTER MAPPING IS THE LATER MAPPING THAT LOOKS BELOW THE BURN AREA TO SEE HOW MUCH GROWTH VEGETATIONS OCCURRING. WE NEED THAT OR TO SEE REFINE OUR ESTIMATES FOR HOW THEM WHEN AND HOW WE HAD OF HAVE TO EVACUATE PEOPLE. A IN THE NEXT A WINTER WE DIDN'T IMPROVE THE LEARNING SYSTEMS AS SUPERVISOR GORD TALKED ABOUT I KNOW THAT CAL O. YES HAS A WORK GROUP AND I MY OFFICE MY STAFF IS ON THAT. WE LOOK FOR DISSING PROGRESS AMOUNT ON TECHNOLOGY AND PROTOCOLS. ACROSS A DIFFERENT SELF FORM SELF OF PHONE PLATFORMS WE NEED TAX RELIEF WOULD YOU TALKED ABOUT WHEN WE RIVER LOCAL MATCH. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR US WE JUST NEED THIS RECOGNITION THAT THE INCIDENT IS NOT CLOSED AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE M. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CITIES AND COUNTIES TO KEEP THAT IN MIND AS WELL. BECAUSE IT'S MISFIRES ORGANIC KEEP ON GIVING AS FAR AS KNOWLEDGE RECOVERY BUT SOME OF THE OTHER AND. THREAT TO THEY POSE AND AGAIN WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AND SUPERVISOR GORD HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD ON CD BG. OF FOR. HELPING LOOK AT DIFFERENT WAYS INFLEXIBILITY AND REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS THAT WE CAN USE SOME OF THOSE FINDINGS. A LOOKING AT HAZARD MITIGATION PROJECTS AND WE'RE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT REIMBURSEMENTS FOR CONTAINING ACTIVATIONS FOR THE STORM. SO I'M HAPPY ANSWER QUESTIONS OF THANKS AGAIN FOR HAVING ME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS MISATO AND OUT WHERE WE HAD A HUGE CRUSH FOR TIME THIS AFTERNOON BECAUSE SESSION WHEN. REALLY LATE AND WE THE COUPLE WITNESSES ON THE SECOND PANEL THAT HAVEN'T. THAT HAVE A OTHER OBLIGATIONS SO I WANT TO INVITE THEM OUT. TO I'D COME ON OUT MISTER DE AS AN INDUSTRY NIGHT WE'RE GOING TO COME ON UP AS WELL. BECAUSE I KNOW THEY HAVE SOMEWHERE TO GO THEN WILL COME BACK. ON SOME LOCAL ISSUES. BUT AS YOU'RE COMING UP ON SURPRISE ACCORD MENTION THIS IN AND MISS MINNESOTA YOU YOU HAD ALSO MENTIONED. THAT. DID THE DIFFICULTY WITH THE FEDERAL GRANTS AND AID. DO YOU. EITHER HAVE THE CAPABILITY IN AND THAT BE THE STAFF. KEYS TO. NAVIGATE ALL OF THAT OR IS THAT WITH THOSE DISASTER CONSULTANTS BECOME FOR YOU. FOR US TO BECOME THAT'S WHAT THEY DO THE DISASTER CONCERN THERE OUGHT THEIR THEIR EXPENSIVE ENDEAVOR IN FACT WE USE TO. I THINK THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA IS USING. BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN. VERY EFFECTIVE ARE WE'RETOLD BUT IT'S IT'S EXPENSIVE ENDEAVORS TO WE'RE PAYING FOR THAT BUT YEAH THERE'S THIS WHOLE DISASTER INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX THAT HARD BECAUSE YOU NEED SO MUCH EXPERTISE TO GET YOUR WAY THROUGH THE FEDERAL PROCESS WHAT WHAT IS THE COMPENSATION LIKE HOW DO YOU. MEASURE COMPENSATION IS IT HOW MUCH MONEY THEY'RE BRINGING IN IS IT BY THE HOUR HOW DO YOU FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY FOR THAT. WE ARE PAYING IT OUT OF OUR GENERAL FUND BUT IF THE I GUESS THE RISK IF YOU DON'T DO THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET YOUR FULL REIMBURSEMENT COSTS AND SO AND IT COULD NOT BE NEXT YEAR TO BE IN THREE YEARS WHEN. A I G. DOES THERE ON IT ON SOMETHING THAT EVEN THE EXISTING FEMALE RAP OR CALLAWAY SAID THAT SHOULD BE FINE IN THREE YEARS AGO I JEAN INSPECTOR COME CAN COME DOWN ASK FOR HUGE REPAYMENT BACK SO. THAT'S THE FEAR THAT WE HAVE SO THIS IS LIKE A CONSULTANCY ON AN HOURLY BASIS. YEAH IN THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF I COULD JUMP IN AND HELP AS WELL. ONE OF THE CHANGES THAT'S COME OUT OF NATURAL DISASTERS AROUND THE COUNTRY HAS NOW BEEN FEMA ACTUALLY PAYING. IN THEIR REIMBURSEMENTS FOR SOME OF THE COST OF BRINGING IN A SPECIALIST WHO IS ABLE TO DO THIS SO A LOT OF THOSE FUNDS THAT YOU WILL SEE. THAT'LL COME IN FROM EMA ACTUALLY HAVE A PERCENTAGE OF THEM THAT COME WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT MUNICIPALITIES AND ARE GOING TO BE BRINGING IN EXPERTS AYE IT'S NOT JUST ON THAT FRONT WE IN THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA HAVE ACTUALLY BROUGHT IN AN ENTIRE PERMIT. DEPARTMENT TO TRY TO EXPEDITE THE REBUILD THIS WELL MOVING OUR PLAN CHECK FROM THREE MONTHS DOWN TO FIVE DAYS A LOT OF THAT IS COVERED BY BY FEMA AND THROUGH. BY OUR FEES BUT TODD JUST TO CLARIFY. SOME OF US IN UP MORE WAYS TO GET YOU MORE MONEY ON A LOT OF THOSE COSTS ARE REIMBURSED BY FAMOUS TO APPLY FOR THOSE MONIES. PERFECT FANTASTIC THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION ON THAT THE OTHER QUESTION THAT I HAD FOR. SUPERVISOR GORE WAS ABOUT DEBRIS REMOVAL BUT IT'S COMPLY FOR THE THE OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT. REPRESENTATIVES. PEOPLE AND FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO IN THE HAVE FIGURED OUT PRETTY QUICKLY. WAS THERE A RIGHT CHOICE OR KNOWS IT REALLY INDIVIDUAL FOR FOR EACH PERSON THAT THEY TO FIGURE IT OUT. YOU KNOW IT'S A AS YOU UNTIL THAT ONION. YOU KNOW IT'S A FASCINATING THING BECAUSE WHAT YOU REALIZE IS FIRST OF ALL. IF LET'S SAY WE DID NOT OPT IN TO THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM AND OFFER THAT WE HAD FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED HOMES DOWN IN CINEMA COUNTY. IF WE HAD NOT WHAT THAT MEANS IS YOU'RE CONSCIOUS OPENING UP EVERYBODY TO FIND CONTRACTORS. TWO DO IT WHO ARE LICENSED AND SPECIALIZED IN WHO COME IN HERE BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY AS MUCH AS YOU CAN BLAME THE ARMY CORPS FOR INEFFECTIVE. YOU KNOW NOT BEING NIMBLE CAN YOU IMAGINE THE LOGISTICS OF HAVING THAT MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE FLYING AROUND EACH OTHER WITH. WITH FOR THAT MUCH OF AN EFFORT IT'S JUST IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT CON OF FEASIBLE THE SECOND THING IS IS THAT. SO THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM COVERS YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE INSURANCE HAS FOR DEBRIS REMOVAL BUT WHATEVER GOES ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE WITH THE PRIVATE COMPANY. NOW IF YOU LOOK AT LAKE COUNTY THEY PAY THEN THEY HAVE AN AVERAGE OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THEIR. FOR THEIR RECOVERY EXCUSE ME FOR THE DEBRIS REMOVAL PER LOT. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ONLY HAVE THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY THOUSAND BUCKS TO REMOVE IT. BUT EMBEDDED INTO THAT PEOPLE COULD DEFINITELY POKE FINGERS AND SAY WELL THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S A GOVERNMENT COST. I CAN GET IT FOR THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND YOU'RE LIKE YOU'RE RIGHT BUT THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE BRINGING IN SOMEBODY FOR THIRTEEN BUCKS AN HOUR WHO'S NOT WEARING. A PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND COMING IN AND DOING IT. IS BY US GOING INTO THAT PROGRAM IN MANAGING CONTRACTING IT DID PROVIDE. YOU KNOW IT IS GOING TO BE WAY MORE EXPENSIVE. BUT YET YES HE'S QUESTIONS HERE LIKE SHOULD WE REALLY BE REBUILDING OUR COMMUNITY AND HAVE A CLASS ACTION FOR. FOR FOR LUNG CANCER ME SOMETHING YOU KNOW MY FOR YOU KNOW TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW. SO MY THING IS IS THAT IT WAS CLARK KENT CLASSIC GOVERNMENT WHICH IS IT WAS A BLUNT OBJECT. AND WE NEED AT THAT AT THAT TIME. AND DID YOU PAY MORE FOR IT YES BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THE ALTERNATIVE AT THIS POINT. THE THING THAT WE NEED TO TRANSFER TO OTHER COMMUNITIES IS THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO PICK THIS STUFF UP FROM VALID SOURCES. EVERYBODY SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT MAY BECOME PREY TO CONTRACTORS AND OTHER PEOPLE TO RECREATE IT ALL THE TIME. BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS PEOPLE SHOW UP PAPER PARACHUTED IN THEIR LIKE HEY WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN REPRESENT YOU TO FEMA. AND THEN PAY US BACK SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY US WITH THE FEMALE DOLLARS THAT SOUNDS GREAT BUT YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU SHOULD GO WITH HIM. WHOEVER WHATEVER. SO MY ISSUE IS THAT. IS THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH SHARING OF BEST PRACTICES AND I THINK THAT'S. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH TO SEE SACRAMENTO'S REALLY WANNA FIGURE OUT IF YOU ALL? ONE PLUG IS THAT YOU GUYS I THINK TOMORROW IS WHEN ON THE SIXTEENTH OR ON WEDNESDAY. IS WHEN THE CAL O. YES STATE HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN. CLOSES FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. RIGHT. ONE THING THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTING FOR YOU ALL IS TO HAVE A PRESENTATION ON WHAT THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S SEEMED TO BE A TOP OF THE CLASS AND ALLOWS IT TO GET MONEY EARLIER ON. BUT WE'RE TRYING TO GET ALL OUR COUNTIES TO RESPOND TO THE STATE HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN. DRAFT AND SEE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO BUT TO BE INTERESTING TO HAVE YOUR TAKE ON THAT. YEAH. THANK YOU. WE WERE GONNA HAVE OUR NEXT PANEL. OKAY. AS A MEMBER OF A HOPI BRIEF AND. QUESTION TO ACTUALLY. THE THE FOLKS FROM SONOMA COUNTY. BY IT YOU CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE THAT WHILE THE VAST MAJORITY YOU KNOW THE LION'S SHARE OF HOMES OF THE DEGREES BANG CLEAN THERE STILL ARE. PLACES THAT HAVE NOT. AND. OBVIOUSLY THOSE ARE FOLKS WHO OPTED FOR PRIVATE OPTION. HOW YET WHAT'S THE PERCENTAGE OF THAT OUT THERE BECAUSE IT THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE LIKE THESE LITTLE ISLANDS OF ON? I'M CLEAN UP DEBRIS. AND WE'VE WE'VE GOT TO THE POINT WHERE OUT OF OUT OF THREE THOUSAND PLUS HOMES WE ONLY HAVE. FIVE OUTSTANDING THAT ARE UNDER THE ABATEMENT PROCESS BUT BUT IF YOU LOOK BACK WE ACTUALLY HAD AN EMPLOYEE WHO ALL SHE DID FOR THE COURSE OF THE LAST FOUR MONTHS WAS TRACKED DOWN PEOPLE. WHO ARE POTENTIAL OBEY TEES RIGHT AND CALL THEM UP AND THEN EVEN GO ONLINE TO GO ON ANCESTRY DOT COM TRYING FIND BECAUSE ALSO AND SOMEBODY? MEANT I HAD SAY THIS BUT SOMEBODY MAYBE THE PARENTS PASSED AWAY THE HAVE UNSETTLED THE THE PROPERTY AND OUR GOAL IS TO GET COMPLIANCE SO WE HAVE FIVE OUT OF THREE THOUSAND THAT ARE STILL UNDER. POTENTIAL ABATEMENT AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S OUT WITH THE CITY BUT I THINK THEY EVEN DONE BETTER. YEAH WE'RE WE'RE PRETTY MUCH DONE WITH THAT I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ONE PRIVATE. BUSINESS THAT STILL NEEDS TO DO THEIR THEIR CLEARING A AS OF LAST WEEK I HAVE TO CHECK AND SEE IF THAT'S ACTUALLY BEEN DONE. I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN FOR THE MOST PART FROM THE PUBLIC WHEN IT CAME TO THAT THE PRIVATE OFTEN IS. A PIG EFFORT FROM THE CITY AND FROM THE COUNTY TO GET PEOPLE EITHER IN OR OUT MAKE A DECISION THAT ALSO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH PHONE CALLS FROM THE CAST MEMBERS FROM THE SUPERVISORS. REALLY ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO GET THAT PROCESS MOVING BUT WE'VE BEEN AT FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS HAS BEEN PRIMARILY ON THE COMPLAINT SIDE. WHEN FOLKS HAD A COMPLAINT ABOUT EITHER HOW MUCH WAS TAKEN HOW MUCH DIRT WAS TAKEN OR WHETHER AND NOT ENOUGH WAS TAKEN AND REALLY HAVING FEEDBACK COME THROUGH AND FIX THOSE THOSE PROBLEMS. ACTUALLY JUST SAID SHUT DOWN LAST WEEK THE. TOLL NUMBER TO CALL IF YOU HAD AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN TRANSFERRED OVER TO THE COUNTY NOW I BELIEVE IS BACK UP AND RUNNING AGAIN ABOUT WE HAVE NOT HAD TOO MANY OF THOSE GOING FORWARD. S. ONE FINAL QUICK QUICK QUESTION AND THAT IS SAM. SEEN WHAT HAPPENED IN ONE A SEATO AND OBVIOUSLY THE GEOGRAPHY IS DIFFERENT NOW THAN IT IS IN SOME COUNTY. I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER THAT WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE THIS YEAR NUMBER ONE THE TIMING OF THE FIRED TO THE INCREDIBLE WORK BY PEOPLE HELPING TO. SHORT THINGS UP SO THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE. BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER IF NEXT YEAR. WITH THE BURNED TREES WHERE THE ROOTS ARE NOW ROTTED IF WE COULDN'T BE IN A SITUATION WE COULD HAVE STE COULDN'T COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES AND SO. SO HOW ARE YOU LOOKING AT MAINTAINING THOSE THOSE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN. THOUGH THE. THE THE BREAK IN AND WORDS TO PREVENT THESE YOU KNOW. SEMIS LANDSLIDES FROM OR OF MITIGATING FOR POTENTIAL LANDSLIDES BECAUSE THOSE WADDELL'S AND ALL THOSE THINGS THEY DEGRADE OVER TIME SO SO AND AS WE GET INTO THE NEXT RAINY SEASON WHICH. YOU KNOW IT'S MADE ISN'T THAT FAR DOWN THE ROAD. THE DEAD THE DEAD AND DYING TREES THAT WE DON'T LOSE OUR RATES. AT THAT WE CAN GET SOME PRETTY TORRENTIAL RAINS IN CINEMA COUNTY. AS YOU OBVIOUSLY DID AND AND. AND I'M ON A SEATO SO WHERE DO HOW YOU HOW YOU LOOK AT THAT. YEAH I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S TOP OF MIND FOR ALL OF US AS WE DO THIS NOT JUST FOR THAT BUT ALSO DON'T FORGET THAT IN OUR AREA THE BIGGEST THREAT IS STILL GOING TO BE. A BIG EARTHQUAKE SO HOW IS WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS DISASTER DO WE CONTINUE TO PLAN FOR WHAT'S TO COME THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF HYDRA SEED WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE ON THE HILLS. TO TRY TO PREVENT THAT THEN THERE'S ALSO LOOKING AT AREAS WHERE WE KNOW OUR WATER SYSTEM IN PARTICULAR HAS BEEN COMPROMISED WHERE THE PIPES OF LITERALLY BURNED IN THE GROUND. AT HAVE MELTED KNOWING THAT THAT'S GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THOSE AREAS AS WELL AND TRIED TO DO SOME MAPPING AROUND THAT. MIKE SCREW ACTUALLY PUT TOGETHER AN EMERGENT IT MONITORS. THAT WE APPROVED IN THE OTHER FUNDING BUDGET FOR. FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND BUCKS TO PUT INTO. YEAH. WE WE HAVE DUBBED TWELVE STE A EXCUSE ME TWELVE RAIN GAUGES AND. EXCUSE ME FOURTEEN RAIN GAUGES TWELVE. DREAM CAGES TO PROVIDE US WITH EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS AND. ONE OF THE. IF THEY WERE WE WE DO OBVIOUSLY CAN GET A LOT OF RAIN I THINK IT THAT WHAT HAPPENED AND MONOSYLLABIC ARE DESCRIBED AS A RAIN BOMB. IT WAS I THINK WAS A HALF INCH OF RAIN IN THE HALF HOUR. EVEN IMAGINE THAT I MEAN IT'S LIKE BEING UNDER WATER I WOULD THINK. BUT. THAT YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S DEFINITELY AREAS OF CONCERN ITEM WE ARE. ARE TO PLUG A FEAST MEANT THAT COULD HAPPEN BETTER TOPOGRAPHY IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN. WHAT YOU HAVE THERE AND I WOULD OF BEEN A WE CAN MAKE OUR BANKERS CROSS WE ALSO HAD PP CLASS WITH ABOUT? FOR IN A WE WERE LUCKY WE HAD A WHICH CALL THE IDEAL WATER YEAR THE IDEAL WINTER WHERE WE WOULD GET THESE AND NOT FROM A FLOOD CONTROL PERSPECTIVE. THAT WE WOULD GET THESE GREAT LITTLE STORMS COME IN AND WET THE GROUND STARTS STUFF GROWING AND SO. THAT THEY ARE. THERE OBVIOUSLY IS ALWAYS THAT THREAT BY I TYPE I KNOW I'VE BEEN OUT THE LOWER IN SEVERAL OF OUR REGIONAL PARK OF SKYLER REGIONAL PARK AND. THEY ARE THEY'RE REALLY COMING BACK WELL IT'S IT'S SURPRISING HOW MANY OF THE. HOW MUCH THE POTENTIATION YOU'D THINK IS DEAD THAT ACTUALLY ISN'T? SO WILL WE KEEP OUR FINGERS CROSSED AND HOPE WE DON'T GET A. HALF. HAVE YOU GUYS I'VE BEEN AVAILABLE THOUGH IS THIS IS TWO TO THREE YEARS AFTER THE AFTER THE FIRES IS WHEN YOU HAVE TO GET THE BIG FLOODS. OR THE DEBRIS FLOWS EXCUSE ME WHATEVER THEIR HAD. BUT THE OTHER THING IS IS I I DO WANT TO STRESS THAT PRIVATE PROPERTY WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES IS BECAUSE. UNLESS YOU'RE IN A COMMUNITY LIKE. LIKE UP WAY UP NORTH WITH WHERE YOU HAVE A LOT OF BLM LAND OR% FOR SERVICE LAND LIKE IN SOME OF YOUR DISTRICTS. YOU KNOW SOME MEMBER WOULD LIKE IN A WAY UP NORTH YOU HAVE TO DEAL PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERS ALL OVER THE PLACE AND THERE'S NO MONEY TO GO IN AND DO THAT SO WHAT WE DID WAS ACTUALLY USED. SOME OF THE PHILANTHROPIC MONEY LIKE FRANCE AND SOME CLEAN POWER BUT MONEY ON THE TABLE WE ENDED UP GIVEN. FIFTY GRAND EACH TO ABOUT FOUR DIFFERENT. WATERSHED GROUPS THAT JUST WENT OUT AND THEY WERE LIKE WATERSHED MARINES PUT UP WADDELL'S DOING ALL THIS WORK. AND THAT IS A HUGE GAP THAT NOTHING IS THERE TO FILL. US DEPARTMENT AGRICULTURE HOW SOME PROGRAMS BUT IT IS IT. YOU KNOW WE TALKED ACTUALLY WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULDN'T BOTH YOU AND YOU KNOW THAT CHAIR LEVINE AND YOU GUYS WERE REALLY HELPFUL WITH US TRYING TO. THINK THROUGH THE PROCESS OF HIS THERE IS THAT WATER BOND OR IT YOU KNOW IS THERE ANYTHING OUT THERE TO HELP PEOPLE AND PUT IN. APPLICATIONS THROUGH OUR RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS TO DO THIS BUT I MEAN YOU'RE ALWAYS PLAYING CATCH UP. AND THAT'S THE BIGGEST ISSUE RIGHT I THINK THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU GUYS FOR DOING YOUR WORK IS THAT. ALWAYS REACTIVE AND EVERYBODY'S LEARNING THEIR OWN LESSON RATHER THAN LEARNING FROM OTHERS THAT'S THE DANGER GOING AND FUTURE. YEAH I DO WANT TO PUT IN A QUICK PLUG TO IN OUR AREA THERE'S A SOMETHING TO KEEP AN EYE ON CALLED PEPPER WORD PEPPER WOULD PRESERVE. AND THE PRESERVES ESSENTIALLY A RESEARCH INSTITUTION. THAT LOOKS AT THE WAY THAT NATURE REACTS TO CIRCUMSTANCES HALF OF THE PRESERVE WAS I IN THE FIRES OWN HALF OF IT WAS NOT THEY'LL BE ABLE TAXI MAKE RESEARCH COMPARISONS. BASED ON WHAT THEY SEE AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH PARTS OF IT HAD GONE THROUGH PRESCRIPTIVE BURNS AHEAD OF TIME AT HALF OF IT HAVE GONE THROUGH SOME CLEARING AHEAD OF TIME. AND LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENCE IN HOW IT WAS IMPACTED BY THE FIRE YOU HAVE FIFTY STUDIES GOING RIGHT NOW ON IT ALREADY WITH A BEFORE AND NOW pSOME REALLY INTERESTING DATA FOR THIS BODY TO LOOK AT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. THANK AND I DO HOPE THIS BODY AND LOOK AT THAT DATA. IN THE FUTURE AND. I WANTED TRANSITION US TO SOMETHING THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS HOUSING AND HOMES HOMES HOMES HOMES. AND THEN WE HAVE TO INDIVIDUALS I THINK WOULD HAVE THE FOUR OF YOU STATE BECAUSE YOU OFFICE AT TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HERE TO SPECIFICALLY TALK ABOUT LABOR AND BUILDING SPECIALIST. ART THERE ARE STRATEGIES I GUESS I IN OUR DISTRICTS. THE REBUILDING PROCESS IS A LONG PROCESS IT'S NOT HAPPENING AS FAST AS OUR CONSTITUENTS WOULD LIKE IT TO. AND SO I THINK I'M GUESSING THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND REPRESENTATIVES HAVE HEARD A LITTLE BIT MORE. AND IT JUST BECAUSE OF YOUR TIME AND THEN WE HAVE BUT WE DO HAVE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HERE WE HAVE SAYS THAT OF THE S. WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDINGS TRADE. ASSOCIATION. WHO HAS WORKED ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES RELATED TO HOUSING AND THE LABOR FORCE ON WHICH SEEMS WE MAY BE SHORT OF AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT AS WE THINK OF ALL OF THE NEEDS BUT YOU WILL TELL US WHAT WE? ARE WHAT IS TRUE AND WHAT IS NOT A WHAT IS JUST PERCEPTION. BOOK AND SO SAYS IS GONNA SPEAK AT A LITTLE BIT TO THAT BUT WE ALSO HAVE SCOTT. PLAN NYBORG GUY WHO IS THE DISASTER RECOVERY OPERATIONS MANAGER FOR ALLEN CONSTRUCTION. A CONSTRUCTION COMPANY AD THAT HAS BEEN AROUND IN SANTA BARBARA FOR DECADES ON AND HAS DONE A LOT OF WORK IN HAS BEEN ONE OF THE FIRST RESPONSE OVER HOPING THAT. AT THE BOTH OF YOU CAN ADD TO THIS CONVERSATION FROM THE LANDS OF THAT BUILDING. AND LABOR. PLEASE. HARM THOUGHT THANK YOU SUMMON MEMBERS OF FOR HAVING ME HERE IN THE. TAG OUT OF BOYS FROM LABOR. AND TO ALL THE PANELISTS AS WELL FOR THEIR INFORMATIVE PRESENTATIONS A. I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE AND DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THESE ISSUE THAT'S A STATE NOT THE COMMUNITY FOR A VERY LONG TIME. SINCE LAST YEAR WHEN. WE WERE ON A. WAS ACTUALLY ON THE DELEGATION WITH A FEW ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND WE LEARNED ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT WERE HAPPENING BACK IN THE DISTRICTS WITH THE FIRE AND HOW IT IMPACTS A LOT OF MEMBERS THAT LIVE IN AROUND THOSE COMMUNITIES. YES IT'S TO THINK GETS WORKING. AND SO. YOU KNOW WE HAD A LOT OF WE HAVE A LOT OF MEMBERS TO LIVE IN THE FIRE IMPACTED AREAS. AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR A LOT OF THESE MEMBERS THEY NOT ONLY LOST THEIR HOMES ARE TRYING TO FIND OUT LIKE HOW THEY'RE GOING TO CONTINUE. TO MOVE AHEAD WITH THEIR OWN CAREERS A LOT OF THEM ARE PRINTS AS WE HAVE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED APPRENTICES JUSTIN SINAMA ALONE. AND SO AS WE BECAME ENGAGED WITH THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS WITH FEMA AND SOME OF THE CONTRACTING PROCEDURES THAT THEY HAVE FOR THE IMMEDIATE CLEAN UP. IT WAS. RARELY AVAILABLE FOR A SECOND IT'S NOTICEABLE. THAT. THEY WERE TRYING THEIR BASS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES THERE AND SO THERE WAS A LOT OF DISASTERS DURING THAT PARTICULAR TIME AND THERE THERE ISN'T. AN INDUSTRY AROUND DISASTER THERE ARE CONTRACTORS THAT GO NATIONWIDE. AS YOU HAVE KNOWN AND THEY THEY BID OUT ON FEMALE PROJECTS AND SO DURING THIS TIME YOU HAVE THE DISASTERS IN THE EAST COAST. AND PORTO RICO. SO ALLOW THOSE CONTRACTORS HAD LOCKED IN THOSE LONG TERM YOU KNOW SORT OF CONTRACTS AND SO WHEN FEMA CAME TO THE CALIFORNIA THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT A LOT OF THE. COMPANIES THAT WORK HERE ALREADY WOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE FUNDS OVER THE THOSE CONTRACTS. AND SO THEY WERE IN THE FUNDS THAT THEY WERE PUTTING OUT NOW THEN YOU THEN SUBSEQUENTLY RETRACTED THE WAY THAT THEY ORIGINALLY PUT OUT THE FIRST PROCUREMENT. AND THEN ISSUE THEM OUT AT SERVICE CONTRACTS. INTERNET SERVICE CONTRACTS THAT CREATES A NEW DESIGNATION OF CONTRACT AND AS WAS STATED BEFORE IT LOWERED THE ROLE THE WAGE RATES OF A LOT OF THESE LABORERS THAT WERE ACTUALLY BUILT BUILDING THOSE PROJECTS. SO NOT ONLY. WAS IT NON BC FOR US IN TERMS OF OF A UNION SCALE WAGES WAS NOT COMPETITIVE FOR THESE CONTRACTORS TO BOTTOM BID ON THIS WORK. BUT IT WAS ALSO A PROBLEM FOR THE YOUNG NONUNION SECTOR OF CONTRACTORS IN THOSE AREAS NOT KEEPING MONEY YOU WILL KNOW THAT. WE OFTEN FIGHT WITH THOSE SAME NONUNION CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATIONS HEARING COMMITTEES SUCH AS THESE AND OFTEN FIGHTING ABOUT. YOU KNOW DIFFERENT STANDARDS WHETHER RETRAINING APPRENTICESHIP OR ACTUAL WAGE RATES. ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE WE'RE BOTH ON THE SAME SIDE BECAUSE EVEN THE NONUNION CONTRACTORS COULD NOT COMPETE. WITH SOME OF THOSE. RATES THAT WERE BEING PAID FROM THESE NATIONAL CONTRACTOR ORGANIZATION SO YOU WOULD FIND THAT PEOPLE THAT DID NOT LIVE IN AND AROUND THOSE COMMUNITIES WILL COME IN. AND ACTUALLY SEE TO PERFORM THE WORK NOW. IN DOING SO. IN A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE WOULD THAT WERE MENTIONED. BOB FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY AND PROTECTION. DIDN'T HAVE THE TRAINING THEY WERE HAZMAT READY OR CERTIFIED FACT A LOT OF OUR UNIONS HAVE TO RAMP UP IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL TRAIN OF THE HATS TAKE PLACE WITHIN OUR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS LOOK IN THE AREA. RETIREES CAME OUT YOU KNOW FROM THE RETIREMENT APPRENTICES JOURNEY PERSONS THEY ALL HAD TO GO TO THE HAZMAT READING ITS COURSE AND CATCH UP TO WHERE THEY WERE BEFORE OUR PENSION PROGRAMS ACTUALLY RAN. DAY AND NIGHT OF FORTY HOUR OSHA TRAINING TO GET PEOPLE READY SO THEY CAN GO OUT AND DO THE WORK AND GET PEOPLE BACK ON THEIR FEET. BUT A LOT OF THESE OUT OF STATE NONUNION INDIVIDUALS DIDN'T HAVE THE PROTECTION THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE PROTECTIVE CLOTHING OU DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO APPLY IT AND HOW TO USE IT THEMSELVES. THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR THE INDIVIDUAL THE PROBLEM FOR A THINK ALLOW THE COMMUNITY AS WELL BECAUSE IF THEY'RE NOT ONLY TRAINED. SUCH A DEAL WITH HAZARDOUS MATERIALS THEY OFTEN WILL DISPOSE OF IT IN WAYS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY HELPFUL TO LOCAL COMMUNITY SO THAT YOU HAVE. ADDED LONG TERM NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS BECAUSE GOD DEBRIS WAS NOT HANDLED CORRECTLY EVEN. HOW YOU COLLECTED THE BREED TO HOW YOU ACTUALLY SHIP IT OUT OF THE AFFECTED AREA? HAS TO BE DONE CORRECTLY IN FACT SOME OF OUR TRUCKS PARKED ON TARPS SO THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY PULLING SOME OF THAT TOXIC DEBRIS ARE IN THEIR WHEELS AND THEN SPREADING IT AROUND. SO THESE ARE A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN THEY GO INTO. OF THE IMMEDIATE ARE AT WORK FOR RECOVERY OUT OF THERE WE ARE ARMY OUR UNIONS ARE PROUD OF OF THE OTHER COMMUNITIES THEY OFTEN ARE THE FIRST ONES THERE WORKING ALONGSIDE THE FIRST RESPONDERS. AND IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION WITH THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES UP THE HAVE TESTIMONIALS FROM OUR FRIENDS THE FIREFIGHTERS WHO WERE OUT THERE FIGHTING AND THEN HE OF BULLDOZERS BASICALLY TRYING TO CLEAR OUT. AHEAD SAID THEY COULD HAVE SOME A LEAST A LITTLE BETTER REPRIEVE A CLEARING OUT A WHOLE BUNCH OF LIKE A FIRE DEFENSE LINE IN A FIRE BREAK LINE. SO YOU NEED TO HAVE. OF ACCESS TO A READILY SKILLED IN AVAIL TRAINED WORK FORCE TO HELP YOU NOT ONLY DURING THE ACTUAL. EMERGENCY ITSELF BOB ALSO IN THE RECOVERY AND YOU MENTIONED HOUSING RIGHT. SO. YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD THE CALL. FOR WORKERS TO COME AND ADDRESS THE WORKER SHORTAGE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE IS A SORT OF A LINEMAN DISCONNECT THERE'S GOING TO BE TONS OF WORK IF A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE MENTIONED WITH REGARD TO PERMITTING FUNDING. THE INSURANCE ISSUES GET RESOLVED BUT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH BUILDING GOING ON RIGHT NOW. AND WHEN THE THAT ARE PAID OF SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER RATE THAN A LOT OF THE JOURNEY PERSONS THEY'RE READY TO GO OUT AND BE PUT TO WORK. AND SO WE WANT TO PARTNER WITH OUR CONTRACTOR ASSOCIATIONS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE THOSE WORKERS ARE RE THERE THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE SHIPPED THEN. THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE POWERS DANNY AND IN ANY ON. HOTEL OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THEY'RE READY TO BE PUT TO WORK AND SO. WE'VE BEEN TALKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THERE ARE THE CAN THESE CONVENING IS ALL OF THESE GROUPS ARE BRING ALL THESE RESOURCES TOGETHER TO SHARE INFORMATION. EYES ONE THE TO PUT ON THE RECORD THAT A LOT OF OUR UNIONS WOULD BE ABLE TO BRING IN THE WORKERS FROM OTHER AREAS IF THOSE WORKERS AREN'T THERE ALREADY. AND I THINK THEY'RE ALSO WILLING TO TALK TO CONTRACTORS ABOUT THE DIFFERENT WAGE RATES THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE SAID THESE COMMUNITIES CAN BE BUILT UP AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. PARTICLE YEAH I WOULD I WOULD ASK YOU LOOK AT THE USE OF APPRENTICES. BECAUSE THEY DO NEED. THAT EXTRA LEVEL OF EXPERIENCE AND A LOT OF THE SINGLE FILE ME HOMES SO NECESSARILY NEED THE HIGHER SKILL SETS WHEN YOU'RE BUILDING A HOSPITAL OR POWER PLANT OR SUCH THING. SAW WOULD SAY THAT. TAP INTO THE THE THE LOCAL CONTRACTORS AND THEIR WORKERS AND I THINK I YOU'LL BEABLE TO FIND A LOT OF SKILLED WORKERS READILY AVAILABLE. I THINK AND ASSIGN NUMBER I CARE CURRY'S SO ON THE ISSUE WE'VE FOUND IS A MERCED RING TOLD LACKEY MATERIALS MATERIALS COSTS HAVE GONE SKY HIGH. IT'S GONE FROM IN SANTA ROSA BELIEVE A HOUSE WENT FROM AN A TO INTERSCOPE DOLLARS A SQUARE FOOT TO FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS WORTH WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. AND. SO LABOR IS AN ISSUE AND WE TALKED IT'S IN THE AREA LAKE COUNTY IS THE WORST BY FAR. CAMPAIGNING WORKERS UP THERE BECAUSE THEY COULD REALLY GET THE BETTER WAGE DOWN IN SANTA ROSA. SO IT'S STILL A LABOR THING FOR US AND I DON'T. I'M FRY GET FRUSTRATED JUNE TWENTY HOW CAN WE GET MORE PEOPLE IN HERE YOU'RE SHOWING ME WE HAVE PLENTY OF WORKERS TO BUILD HOMES RIGHT NOW. DR YEAH ABSOLUTELY I THINK IF YOU DEVELOP BE A. I MEAN THEY THEY TALKED ABOUT AND IN THIS WORKING GROUP HOW TO SIGN. UP PROJECTS OF SCALE RIGHT IT'S IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT AN INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNER AND THEY'RE OUT THERE TRYING TO FIND A CONTRACTOR THEY'RE DEALING WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE CUT OFF ON THEIR OWN. THERE MIGHT BE SOME DIFFICULTIES THERE FOR TRYING TO TO GET. THAT PROJECT UP AND RUNNING. SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE PART OF WAS LOOKING AT ENTIRE AREA. AND BE ABLE TO SORT OF BLOCK IT OUT THAT THERE BE A ONE CONTRACTOR A CENTER CONTRACTORS THAT ACTUALLY DO THE REBUILDING ON THERE. AND THAT WHEN YOU HAVE THAT TYPE OF SCALE YOU MAY HAVE MORE WORKERS THAT WILL BE OUT TITLE BAILABLE TO THAT CONTRACTOR ABOUT SPECIFIC PROJECT. BECAUSE NOW IT'S NOT JUST ONE SINGLE PALM AS A MULTITUDE OF THE ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT CAME UP WAS IN COFFEE PARK. WE HAD I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY HOMES GO. A DEVELOPER HAD THOUGHT THAT HE WANTED TO FACE COULD DO THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE GOING TO TAKE IT OVER. INNOCENTS BACKED UP. NOT BECAUSE TO EXPENSIVE FOR HIM TO GET EMPLOYEES FROM POINT A IN THE BAY AREA. AND TO DRIVE UP TO. CENTER ROSA IS NO HOUSING. WE NOTE THE POPLAR THROW THINGS OR ARE IN THE WAY. AND THERE'S MANY FIVE RESIDENTS OF LIVING UP THERE THAT ARE IN THE HILLS THEIR ONE OFFS. SO I MEAN THERE'S A LOT HERE IN I JUST I I I I JUST LOOK FOR MORE HELP ON THE LABOR SIDE IS TO HIM YOU KNOW HELP OUT. YOU KNOW I I UNDERSTAND WHERE THE GENTLEMAN CAME FROM FROM THE BAY AREA SAID. IN THIS IS A PENCIL OUT WELL RIGHT. IN THE MEANTIME I HAVE PEOPLE WITHOUT A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. IT'S UPSETTING TO ME TO THINK THAT BUT HOW DO WE MOVE THIS ALONG. I'M I THINK THE COUNTY HAS DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB OF TRYING TO MOVE PERMITTING ALONG IN THEIR INSPECTIONS ALONG I THINK THAT THEY HAVE. STEPPED UP SANTA ROSA STEPPED UP TO COUNTY STEPPED UP SO. THIS ONE PIECE LIKE WE HOW WE GET THERE. AS WELL AS IT IS JUST THE MATERIALS THEMSELVES REPEAL OF CEMENT I CAN GET LUMBER RIGHT NOW I CAN'T GET THIS YOU KNOW SO. THERE'S A LOT TO THIS IS NOT JUST I'M NOT FINGER POINTING AT LABOR NECESSARY GOING TO SING. THERE'S SO MUCH HERE AND WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT SO IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE SAME VOTE SO. UNTIL I THINK. WENT WHEREVER THERE'S WORK AVAILABLE ONCE BUT IT'S PRETTY GOOD CONSTRUCTION RIGHT AND THERE IS A A. SIGURD ECONOMY RIGHT NOW FOR A CONSTRUCTION WORKER. AND THEN THAT THEIR WAGES ACTUALLY BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE I THINK THAT'S ALWAYS THE CASE. ARMED WITH REGARDS TO LUMBER MATERIALS AND AND ALL THAT BUT I THINK THAT IT JUST. YOU'RE LOOKING AT A BUILDING BOOM AND YOU LOOK IN AN AREA THAT NEEDS A WHOLE BUNCH OF MATERIALS ALL AT ONCE AND I THINK THAT IN THAT CASE. THERE IS SORT OF A MARKET TO TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AS WELL THAT THING THAT'S WHERE GOVERNMENT CAN STEP IN. AND ASSIST A LOT OF THESE HOMEOWNERS AND TRY TO HELP THEM GET OFF ON THEIR FEET WITH GRANTS OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE. I THINK. WE'VE HEARD EXAMPLES OF THAT AS WELL WHERE A CONTRACTOR HAS AHEAD JUST CAN'T FIND THE WORKERS. AND WHEN I HEAR THAT I IMMEDIATELY CALL MY LOCAL BUILDING TRADES WORK BUT UNIONS AND SAY HEY THIS CONTRACTOR HAD JUST SIGNAL THAT THEY CANNOT FIND THE WORKERS. HAVE THEY CALLED YOUR HALL. HAVE THEY TALKED YOU HAD THEY DID A SURVEY OF YOUR PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS AND WHO'S ON THE BOOKS AND IT WAS ON I'M IN THE HALLWAYS WHEN FOR WORK. NONE OF THAT HAS HAPPENED SO I THINK THERE'S A DISCONNECT OR PERHAPS A FEAR OF NOT REACHING OUT TO THE BUILDING TRADES UNIONS BECAUSE THEY WILL BELIEVE THAT THERE'S GONNA BE A COST INCREASE. THAT'S WHY I MENTIONED THE USE OF APPRENTICES BECAUSE THAT APPRENTICE WAGE RATE IS FORTY PERCENT THAT OF A JOURNEY PERSON WAGE RATE. SO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER WHEN YOU'RE TURNING OFF A FIRST YEAR APPRENTICE. AND IF THOSE JOBS WERE TO BE OPEN I THINK THE OPPRESSION PAUL'S WOULD OPEN UP FOR MORE NEW WORKERS TO ACTUALLY ACCESS AND THAT'S WHAT I MEAN YOU KNOW ONE REAL QUICK EXAMPLE. A GENERAL'S UPON A HE'S A PLUMBER HERE IN SACRAMENTO. HE HAS A VAN FILLS UP WITH THE TRAILER ON THE BACK GOES TO LOW'S OR TO HOME DEPOT EVERY SINGLE DAY. FILLS IT UP IN SACRAMENTO AND TAKES IT OVER TO. TO SANTA ROSA TO WORK. AND HE DOES NOT PICK UP ANY OTHER SUPPLIES AND SANTA ROSA OR ANYWHERE ELSE BECAUSE HIS FREIGHT IF YOU HOOKS INTO HOME DEPOT OR LOW WHEREVER IT MIGHT BE. HIS ILLNESS IS EMPLOYEES. SO HE BRINGS HIS EMPLOYEES EVERY SINGLE DAY BACK AND FORTH AND ONLY PICKS UP HIS A HAS A PIPE FITTINGS OR WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO PICK UP. HERE IN SACRAMENTO. TRUE STORY. THE OKAY LET ME THAT HE DOESN'T WORKERS AT HOME ANY THE LOSES EMPLOYEES RIGHT. BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T OUR SCALP EMPLOYEES OF MAN OF RIGHT NOW SOME OF THESE PLACES SO ANYWAY. JUST WANTED TO LET THAT THAT THEY LET YOU GO ON. SOME SORRY SCOTT MAYBE YOU CAN ADD TO THIS THAT HOOKAH. LIKE TO. THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR. INVITING US TO BE HERE AND FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THESE MATTERS. BUT IT'S GOT NYBORG. IT NORMALLY THE SUSTAINABILITY MANAGER DOWN CONSTRUCTION BUT. MOST RECENTLY DISASTER RECOVERY OPERATIONS. WHICH I HOPE IS A. A TEMPORARY TITLE. WE HAVE A THIRTY SIX YEAR HISTORY IS GENERAL CONTRACTOR IN SANTA BARBARA. ON THE SEAT OF INSURER. THE AREAS AFFECTED BY THE THOMAS FIRE THE MUNCIE SO. DEBRIS FLOW. AND. HAVE MADE THE RECOVERY EFFORT. FRONT AND CENTER. AND. FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES TO HELP REBUILD OUR COMMUNITY. LIKE TO. SHOW YOU SOME PICTURES FROM PROJECTS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON AND TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH. TICKETS DOWN. A LEVEL OF GRANULARITY FOR YOU AS WELL WORD NE. YOU'RE DEALING WITH INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERS. UNTIL CERTAINLY NONE OF THE. THE PUBLIC WORK SCALE. CHALLENGES THAT MY COLLEAGUES ARE DEALING WITH. IT HAS INVOLVED IN MONEY ZERO THAT ARE PROJECTS. SO NATURALLY DIVIDE THEMSELVES INTO THREE PHASES OF THE FIRST STEP IS THE EMERGENCY. DEBRIS REMOVAL. DEMOLITION OF STRUCTURES THAT. HAVE HAVE BEEN. DAM IS BEYOND SALVATION ALSO DEMOLITION PARTIAL DEMOLITION OF STRUCTURES THAT DOWN. CAN BE SALVAGED. THAT STEP IS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE ON MANY OF OUR PROJECTS AT THE CERTAINLY OUR HOMES IN THE AREA THAT. THAT HAVE THIS YET AHEAD OF THEM THE SECOND PHASE IS. A PAUSE AND ON SITE OPERATIONS WHILE WE HELP OUR CLIENTS TO DEAL WITH. INSURANCE SETTLEMENTS AND. OBTAINING RECONSTRUCTION PERMITTING. AND FINALLY. WE GET TO THE RECONSTRUCTION. ITSELF. I SHARE WITH YOU SOME. FIGURES ABOUT ALLEN CONSTRUCTIONS. SLICE OF THE RECOVERY EFFORT MANSIO. WE'RE DEALING WITH APPROXIMATELY FORTY CLIENTS ABOUT HALF OF THOSE. HAVE WHAT WE CALL HEAVY CLEANUP WORK. OR HAVE HAD HEAVY CLEANUP WORK. BY WHICH I MEAN DEALING WITH THE LIKES OF WHICH YOU SEE IN THE PICTURE. THE. IT INTENSE PORTION OF THAT CLEANUP WORK IS BEHIND US. WE SPENT A VERY INTENSE. ELEVEN WEEKS AND THAT EFFORT EMPLOYING APPROXIMATELY SIXTY FIELD CREW SUPPORTED BY A NUMBER OF SPECIALIST TRADES. DEDICATED ABOUT SEVEN OFFICE STAFF FULL TIME TO SUPPORT AND THAT TEAM ON THE FIELD. AND DURING THAT TIME CLEARED ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED CUBIC YARDS OF DEBRIS THAT AGAIN THIS IS THIS IS PRIVATE MODE. CHRIS SO THAT PUBLIC AGENCIES AREN'T AREN'T. TAKE ANY PART OF THE CLEARING OF THIS DECREE. THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY. DUMP TRUCKS. ID CHIEF CHALLENGES DURING THAT. DURING THAT PHASE OF COURSE FIRST AND FOREMOST IT'S BEEN THE SAFETY OF OUR CREWS ASSISTANCE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS CONSTRUCTION WORK THAT I'VE EVER BEEN INVOLVED IN MY CAREER. IN CONSTRUCTION. SECONDARY TO THAT HAS BEEN THE CHALLENGE OF ACCESS AMONG US IT WAS ACTUALLY CLOSED AND RIGHTLY SO. TO CLEAN UP CREWS. WHILE THE FIRST RESPONDER EFFORT WAS UNDERWAY. UPON. THE. YOU THE OTHER EDGE OF THE SWORD HOWEVER HAS BEEN THAT THESE HOUSES SAT ENCASED IN MUD AND DEBRIS FOR APPROXIMATELY A MONTH. BEFORE WE COULD EVEN START TO DIG THEM OUT. AND SO THERE IS SOME SIGNIFICANT ONGOING DAMAGE DURING THAT TIME. EVEN ONCE TOWN WAS OPENED UP TO PRIVATE CLEAN UP CREWS. ACCESS BEEN DIFFICULT ISSUE ROAD CLOSURES THERE'S BRIDGES THAT HAVE STILL NOT BEEN RECONSTRUCTED. AND EVEN WITHIN THE FOR PROPERTY LINES. WE'VE HAD SOME SIGNIFICANT ACCESS CHALLENGES GETTING TO THE BUILDINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN CONTRACTED TO. TO WORK ON. LOGISTICALLY LABOR AND EQUIPMENT AVAILABILITY HAS BEEN A SERIOUS CHALLENGE FOR US AS HAS THE AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE DUMP SITES. SO A DAILY CHALLENGE DURING THOSE ELEVEN WEEKS OF HEAVY CLEAN UP WAS. FINDING DEBRIS SITES THAT WE COULD AFFORD TO EXPORT TO. OR THAT OUR CLIENTS COULD AFFORD TO EXPORT TO. DOT WAS SOME TECHNICAL DEMOLITION CHALLENGE THE LIKES OF WHICH. YOU SEE IN THE PICTURE. THAT'S NOT THE PURVIEW TYPICALLY. OF A HOME BUILDER. AND I PUT CASH FLOW ON THE LIST BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THIS WAS A LIMITING FACTOR AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WE WERE. ULTIMATELY ABLE TO HELP SO. AT THE HEIGHT OF THE CLEANUP PHASE WE HAVE FRONTED A LOT MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION DOLLARS. OF. UNPAID RECEIVABLES THAT'S A HEAVY BURDEN FOR A SMALL PRIVATE COMPANIES TO BEAR. AND THAT DID ULTIMATELY. CURTAIL THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO HELP AND SO. THE DIFFERENCE IN THE SPEED OF THE CLEAN UP WORK VERSES THE SPEED WITH WHICH. INSURERS WERE ABLE TO PAY OUT. ON THOSE COSTS. WHO WAS WHO WAS IMPACTFUL IN THAT WAY? OUT FOR US. THIS IS MY COLLEAGUE AND CROTCH US STANDING IN FRONT OF A SMALL MOUNTAIN OF MUD THAT WE'VE STOCKPILED FOR. EXPORT FROM THIS PROPERTY. AND IN THIS GRAPHIC YOU CAN SEE. THAT INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERS. THAT WERE WORKING FOR A HAVE HAD TO EXPORT AS MUCH AS A HUNDRED AND SIXTY DUMP TRUCKS. OF MATERIAL FROM THEIR PROPERTY. AGAIN THIS IS THIS IS CLEARING THAT THEY ARE ENTIRELY RESPONSIBLE FOR. SUPPORTED ONLY BY. ANY SETTLEMENT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO SECURE. FROM THEIR INSURERS. WHEN YOU FIGURE THAT PER CUBIC YARD WE'RE LOOKING AT DISPOSAL COSTS OF ANYWHERE FROM FORTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS AND HIGHER. DURING THE NOW YOU KNOW WILD FLUCTUATIONS IN THE IN THE. AND THE MARKET FOR DISPOSAL. PLUS LABOR TO HANDLE THIS MATERIAL YOU CAN SEE WHY DEBRIS CLEARING HAS BEEN SUCH A HEAVY EXPENSE FOR. THESE HOMEOWNERS. ONE THING I WILL APPLAUD INSURERS FOR IS THE DECISION TO COVER THESE COSTS. OVER AND ABOVE WHAT IS TRADITIONALLY THE DEBRIS. REMOVAL THAT THE DIVERT DISAPPROVAL COVERAGE AT LIMIT ON. MOST HOMEOWNERS POLICIES HOWEVER. THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT IS THAT THE AGGREGATE A LIMIT ON THE POLICY REMAINS AND SO HE'S VERY HIGH COSTS OF DEBRIS REMOVAL WHICH HOMEOWNERS POLICIES GENERALLY WEREN'T DESIGNED TO DEAL WITH. ARE ERODING. HOMEOWNERS. RESOURCES FOR RECONSTRUCTION. AS THE HEAVY CLEANUP HAS COME TO A CLOSE. AGAIN OPERATIONS ON SITE HAVE COME TO SOMEONE OF A PAUSE WHILE WE DEAL WITH TWO PRIMARY CHALLENGES ONE IS. HELPING OUR CLIENTS SECURE INSURANCE SETTLEMENT THE OTHERS HELPING THEM SECURE PERMITS AFTER RECONSTRUCTION. THERE'S BEEN. LARGE DISPARITY INSURERS WILLINGNESS OR FOR COMING THIS IN AND HELPING US TO COVER. ALL THESE LOSSES ARE NOTABLE FEW HAVE BEEN VERY FORTHCOMING. WAS SUPPORT FOR OUR POSITION WITH REGARD TO SCOPE OF WORK. THE COST THEREOF. BUT MANY HAVE NOT. JUST TALK ABOUT THE WAY THE DEBRIS REMOVAL COSTS CAN A ROAD. THE RECONSTRUCTION BUDGET. SOME EXAMPLES OF THE KIND OF. THINGS WHERE ALLEN CONSTRUCTION IS FOUND ITSELF IN DISAGREEMENT WITH INSURERS IS FOR EXAMPLE. APPROPRIATE MEANS AND METHODS FOR THE RESTORATION OF THE PROPERTY. AND. GETTING COVERAGE FOR THINGS LIKE PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND GENERAL CONDITIONS WHICH ARE THE VERY REAL AND NECESSARY. COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LARGE TECHNICAL RESTORATION PROJECTS LIKE THIS. JOURNAL CONDITIONS FOR THOSE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE TERM A BASICALLY THE LOGISTICAL COSTS. GENERAL CONTRACTOR IN EXECUTING ANY KIND OF A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT. WE ALSO EXPERIENCED THAT ADJUSTERS COST DATABASES ARE ARE WILDLY OUT OF WHACK WITH. WITH REAL ON THE GROUND CONSTRUCTION COSTS FOR THE CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL COAST EXPECT THIS IS A PROBLEM ALL OVER CALIFORNIA. ESPECIALLY FOR US AND THE LENGTH OF THE WORK FLOW. WITH SOME OF THE CARRIERS THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. HAS REALLY. BEGUN TO BE A BURDEN I FEEL TO. TO THE HOMEOWNERS. ELECTED TIP MY HAT FOR A MOMENT. TO MY COLLEAGUES IN. THE VARIOUS PUBLIC AGENCIES OF THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT. BUILDING APARTMENT FLOOD CONTROL DEPARTMENT AND THE COUNTY SANTA BARBARA HAVE. I THINK REALLY THE LOTS GET THEIR ARMS AROUND SOME NOVEL PROBLEMS. ANIMOSITY MIGHT FLORA CHALLENGE FOR US BUT ONE THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY NEGOTIATE THANKS FOR THEIR HELP HAS BEEN. HAS HAS BEEN KEEPING ABREAST OF THE OF THE DEVELOPMENTS THE SOLUTIONS. THE. THE WORKFLOWS THAT HAVE EMERGED. ONE OF THE ONE OF THE PRIMARY CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE. WORKING WHO NOW WITH OUR WITH OUR PUBLIC COUNTERPARTS IS. THE REMAPPING OF MODESTY THOUGH AND THE MONEY AND THE. THOUGHT THINGS THERE AND. AS. AS WAS EARLIER STATED OF THE HYDROLOGY OF THE REGION HAS BEEN CHANGED BY THE DEBRIS FLOW. AND SO THE FLOODPLAIN IS NO LONGER RATE USED TO BE. NOBODY'S QUITE SURE WHAT THE BASE FLOOD ELEVATION AS BUT THAT. THAT MAP INFORMATION IS FORTHCOMING THE NET EFFECT OF THAT IS THAT SOME OF OUR CLIENTS MAY BE. AT LEAST AT RISK. TO COMPLY WITH THE RULE TO RAISE THEIR HOMES UP OUT OF THE FLOOD PLAIN. UNFORTUNATELY SINCE THE HOMES AREN'T GENERALLY A TOTAL LOSS THE DIFFERENCE IN COST BETWEEN. RAISING THE HOME WHICH CAN WHICH CAN BE. EITHER NEARLY ORG REALLY COMPLETELY A REBUILD OF THE HOME. VERSUS JUST BUILDING BACK IN KIND ARE REALLY SIGNIFICANT AND THERE IS SUCH INTENSE COST PRESSURE ON THESE PROJECTS THAT MANY OF OUR CLIENTS ARE DIRECTING US. TO HELP THEM TRY TO SKIRT. THIS RULER TO BASICALLY ON. NOT TRIGGER THE THRESHOLD RULE THE FIFTY THE SO CALLED FIFTY PERCENT RULE. THAT WOULD INCUR THE REQUIREMENT TO ACTUALLY RAISE THE HOME UP OUT OF THE ABOUT OF THE BASE FLOOD ELEVATION. WITH RECONSTRUCTION AHEAD OF US I THINK THE SILVER LINING OF COURSE IS. IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD BACK BETTER. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF I THINK REALLY POSITIVE IDEAS AROUND FUTURE RESILIENCE. FOR EXAMPLE REINFORCED WALL SECTIONS. AS WE JUST DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY OF ELEVATING THE HOMES AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES THERE SUCH AS PI LONG FOUNDATIONS OR REYES FOUNDATIONS WITH BREAKAWAY WALLS SO THAT MUCH CAN ACTUALLY FLOW UNDER THE HOUSE WITHOUT IMPACTING THE LIVING SPACE. WITH RELATIVELY MINOR DAMAGE TO THE. TO THE BUILDING. FOR HOMES THAT ARE ARE. NEARLY COMPLETE OR COMPLETELY ALLOWS. RELOCATING THE HOME ON THE PROPERTY IS ALSO POTENTIALLY AN OPTION. AND I I ALSO DON'T WANT TO LET THE OPPORTUNITY PASS TO TALK ABOUT THE A CHANCE THAT WE HAVE TO BUILD BACK. TO HIRE SUSTAINABILITY TARGETS OR EVEN THAT ZERO ENERGY. WE DON'T GET THAT MANY OPPORTUNITIES OVER THE LIFETIME OF A TYPICAL BUILDING TO WORK INSIDE OF THE WALLS ARE WORK INSIDE THE ROOF THE YOU KNOW THE VARIOUS BUILDING ASSEMBLIES AND. WHEN WE DO WE CAN REALLY HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF THAT BUILDING ENCLOSURE. AND AND SO THIS IS A RARE OPPORTUNITY. WITH ALL THAT SAID I THINK AGAIN BE INTENSE COST PRESSURE ON THESE. PROJECTS. LEADS ME TO LIMITED OPTIMISM THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL OF THESE. OF ALL OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES WITHOUT SOME KIND OF. SUPPORT PRIVATE HOMEOWNERS. LIKE TO CLOSE WITH A FINAL THOUGHT. THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO CLEAR MY HEAD FROM ACROSS SPACE. ON YOUR BELLY. IT'S INTENSELY DANGEROUS. VERY DIRTY FILTHY WET. PHYSICAL WORK AND. THE PEOPLE YOU KNOW WORKING AT OUR CONSTRUCTION HAVE BEEN DOING THIS. FOR WEEKS AND WEEKS ON END WITH A SMILE ON THEIR FACE. IN ORDER TO REBUILD THEIR COMMUNITIES IN THIS IS THIS IS THE REAL HEROISM. OF THE RECONSTRUCTION EFFORT. AT THIS POINT I AM VERY PROUD OF THESE GUYS. THESE MEN WITH IT FOR DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING. INTO FAT I'LL LE. ALL UP INTO QUESTIONS AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SCOTT AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR INFORMATION AND I WERE DEATHLY HEARING THEMES. AND THAT HAVE COME UP. FOR BOTH NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL COAST AND. AB BUT ALSO THEMES THAT ARE BY. THAT ARE INDEPENDENT OF JUST REGION BUT ALSO THE KIND OF WHERE WE'RE AT THE TIMELY IN THE RECOVERY PROCESS. SO I APPRECIATE THAT MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS. AS A MEMBER WALDRON. MY AREA HAD THE LILAC FIRE. WHICH WASN'T TO THE SCALE OBVIOUSLY THAT WE SAW HERE BUT. SAN DIEGO BACK WHEN I SERVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE HAD THE CEDAR FIRE. WHICH HAD TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND ALMOST TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND ACRES BURN WITH. TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED STRUCTURES THAT WAS THE FIRST ONE THAT HIT WHEN I WAS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THEN FOLLOWED UP WITH THE WHICH FIRED IN THE CREEK FIRE. WHICH HAD ANOTHER. HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND ACRES SO WHEN WE LIVED THROUGH WE LEARNED A LOT WE LEARNED A LOT BECAUSE WHEN WE HAD THE LILAC FIRE THIS TIME IT WAS NIGHT AND DAY. FROM WHAT IT HAD BEEN AS FAR AS COMMUNICATIONS JUSTLY INTERAGENCY COMMUNICATIONS WAS SO MUCH MORE ADVANCED. YOU KNOW I'M I WAS SPUR GETTING DAILY UPDATES AND SPEAKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES WE HAD. YOU CAL FIRE DIDAN AWESOME JOB A LOCAL FIRE DISTRICTS THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS MUTUAL AID ALL OF THAT. SOME OF THE THINGS WE LEARNED THOUGH WAS IT'S NOT ONLY JUST THE HOMES THAT ACTUALLY BURN THAT ARE IMPACTED BECAUSE. WITH THE CEDAR FIRE. AND MAYBE IT WAS EVEN THE WHICH FIRE WAS WORSE. THE AMOUNT OF ASH THAT FELL AND I DON'T KNOW HOW LOOK WAS YOU KNOW AS FAR AS WITH THE BUT IT FOR A WEEK THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH WHITE ASH AND THEN WHEN YOU GET THE RAIN. PEOPLE'S HOMES WERE MILES FROM THE FIRE. ACTUALLY HAD THE CARP IS DESTROYED ON YOU THE AIR QUALITY IMPACTING PEOPLE'S HEALTH WE HAD. YOU KNOW LOSS OF. KIDS GOING TO SCHOOL JUST EVERYTHING COLLAPSED. AND. YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU I GUESS MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS THE BUT ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS WE SAW AS AN IMPROVEMENT. WAS THE COMMUNICATIONS HOW DID WE GET ALERTS OUT TO PEOPLE WHERE THE FIRE IS GOING BACILLI LA FIRE JUST WITH. VERY QUICKLY ON. AND THEN AFTERWARDS IN RECOVERY HOW DO WE GET INFORMATION OUT TO PEOPLE. WHERE THEY CAN GO TO AXIS THING WHAT'S AVAILABLE I MEAN WE HAD SOME COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND I KNOW DOCTOR WOODS OFFICES BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE KNOW THEY WERE AHEAD OF US? YOU KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON IN SANTA ROSA THAT WE COULD THEN PREPARE FOR IN ADVANCE. TOM YOU'RE HURT WHAT'S THE BEST METHODS THAT YOU FOUND TO COMMUNICATE TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT. YOU KNOW. WHAT'S AVAILABLE HOW CAN THEY GET THE DEBRIS REMOVAL WHAT YOU KNOW. THINGS LIKE THAT. TYPE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE REALLY FIGURED OUT IS WHERE OUR LIMITATIONS ARE ON COMMUNICATION. IS OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE BEEN HAVING A BIG DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ALERT SYSTEM AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT IN CINEMA COUNTY. THE NIGHT OF THE FIRE I THINK MANY OF US LEARNED ABOUT THE LACK OF REDUNDANCY FOR INTERNET AND CELLPHONES IN AREAS OF OUR CITY THAT MAYBE. SOMEWHERE NOT AS AWARE OF AND THE FLOW OF INFORMATION WAS SLOW AS A RESULT OF THAT. WE ARE WORKING ON. PICKING THAT UP AND TRYING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. ONE OF THE FEW PLACES THAT I'D BE CRITICAL OF THE RESPONSE THAT WE'VE SEEN IS YOU WOULD THINK THAT HAVING GONE THROUGH MULTIPLE FIRES THROUGH. MUD SLIDES THAT THERE WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION IN TERMS OF ONE PAGERS THAT WE COULD PUT OUT TO THE PUBLIC. FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROCESS LOOKS LIKE PARTICULARLY FOR DEBRIS REMOVAL AND. THAT WASN'T THERE AND WASN'T AVAILABLE WHEN WE FIRST STARTED WE HAVE IT NOW WE HAVE WEBSITES UP AND WE AS A COMMUNITY HAVE GOT MUCH BETTER ABOUT PUSHING INFORMATION. TO OUR NEIGHBORS. I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I DON'T LEAVE HERE. TALKING ABOUT OUR ALERT SYSTEM WITHOUT. ALSO MENTIONING HOW INCREDIBLE IT WAS NEIGHBORS HELPING NEIGHBORS THROUGHOUT THE FIRE THAT THAT WAS OUR ALERT SYSTEM. AND IT'S BOTH A FAILURE FROM A GOVERNMENT PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO A SUCCESS FROM A COMMUNITY PERSPECTIVE AND NOT TO MISS AN OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST IN THOSE STRUCTURES AS WELL. EIGHTY HAVE A FOLLOW UP ON THAT POINT. MISS WALDRON IS. THEY'RE GONNA LOSE THAT. SIGN. IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT TO. MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS BUT I ALSO THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT PAY ATTENTION TO THEIR CELLPHONES OR HOW THEM OFF AT NIGHT. OR MAY NOT BE AWARE OF WHAT'S. BUT NO THIS LARGE MIGHT BE IN THAT IN FACT. YOU KNOW WITH THE LACK OF SIRENS WERE YOU KNOW WE OF SOME FLOOD SIRENS WHERE I LIVE BUT. THAT THAT NEIGHBOR NEIGHBOR CONTACT WAS THAT VOICE OF URGENCY THAT THIS IS REAL AND YOU ACTUALLY NEED TO GET UP OUT OF YOUR COMFORTABLE HOME. BECAUSE DANGER IS IMMINENT. WHEREAS YOU KNOW WE KIND OF GET THESE ALERTS SOMETIMES AND IT'S A BIT MORE PASSIVE. AND DATA AND THAT THAT ALONE. DID YOU KNOW THE FUTURE WOULDN'T GIVE PEOPLE THAT THAT SAME SENSE OF URGENCY NOW YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ANYTHING THAT YOU DO EVEN ON THE ALERT SIZE IF IT'S A SIREN. YOU STILL HAVE TO HAVE A COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AROUND WHAT THOSE SIRENS MEAN JUST SENDING OFF AN ALARM WITHOUT THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY'RE INTENDED TO DO WHERE THEY CAN GO AND FIND MORE INFORMATION. WOULD CREATE PANIC IF YOU HAVEN'T PREPARED THE COMMUNITY ON HOW TO RESPOND TO THAT SIREN SO I THINK THAT WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT IT FROM TWO DIFFERENT ANGLES. ONE IS ON THE TECHNOLOGY SIDE BUT THEM ONE IS STILL HIGHLIGHTING ON THE COMMUNITY SIDE. SOME JUST A QUICK FOLLOW UP ARM LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT ISSUE ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE ENCOUNTERED AFTER THOSE BIG FIRES IN THE MID. A TWO THOUSANDS WAS. YOU KNOW. PEOPLE THEN COULDN'T GET INSURANCE I MEAN I WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WE COULD NOT GET INSURANCE I WAS ON THE FAIR PLAN AND MY WAY SAID THE FAIR PLAYING ISN'T FAIR. BECAUSE. THE AVERAGE COST IS MORE THAN DOUBLE WHAT THE MARKET RATE WOULD BE FOR A HOME AND IF YOU CAN'T GET INSURANCE THEN. PEOPLE WILL WALKING AWAY FROM THEIR HOMES. SO HOW DO WE. THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING I GUESS WE'RE ALL GOING TO HAVE TO WORK ON BECAUSE. YOU KNOW THEY SAY HI FIRE RISK AREAS NOW THERE. MY DISTRICT IS IN YOUR ALL YOUR DISTRICTS WILL BE IF THEY'RE NOT ALREADY. I'M GONNA HAVE. WHEN NEW HOMES BUILT ON MORAL ENCOURAGING YOU KNOW HOMEOWNERSHIP AND BUILDING. HOW ARE THEY GONNA GET INSURED AND THE FAIR PLAN REALLY IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR? HAS NO AFFORDABILITY THERE AND IT'S JUST BASIC. COVERAGE IT REALLY DOESN'T COVER MUCH SO. I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF PUT THAT OUT THERE FOR THE COMMITTEE. IF IF I MAY THERE WAS AN ARTICLE WRITTEN AND BLOOMBERG THAT TALKED ABOUT. IT WAS CHALLENGING US IN SAYING ARE WE SUBSIDIZING PEOPLE A REPAIRMAN FILE UP FIRE AREAS. RIGHT NOW IT'S WHAT WE ALL HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR IS IS AS WE DO THAT IS BECAUSE YOU WANT AFFORDABILITY BUT AT THE SAME TIME. IF SOMEBODY THINKS THAT IN THE FUTURE THEY CAN LIVE IN A FIRE AREA AND HAVE LOK LOW INSURANCE COVERAGE AND HAVE GREAT RESULTS IT'S NOT THERE. IF YOU LOOK IN KEY WEST I HAD A CHANCE. TO GOT TO KEY WEST IMPORTER RICO'S APART A DISASTER TOURS KEEP FOLKS IN KEY WEST PAY MORE ON. INSURANCE THEY DO ON THEIR MORTGAGE RIGHT. ARE NOT NOT KEY WEST THE KEYS RIGHT NOW HAVE A A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT INSURANCE THAT BUNDLE AROUND IT AND. IN THAT IF YOU LOOK ON THE OTHER SIDE IT'S IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE HEARING IS IS THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IS INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE DROPPING OUT OF THESE AREAS AND SO YOU HAVE GROUPS LIKE. WITH IT WHAT'S REFERRED TO AS LOW TO LONDON. WHICH IS BASICALLY A RISK POOL BY INVESTORS THAT THEY PUT INTO AN AREA IT'S NOT REALLY AN INSURANCE. PROGRAM IT'S IT IT'S A RISK PROGRAM THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO TO BUNDLE IT. BUT I THINK YOUR QUESTION BEFORE IS WHAT IS TRUE RESILIENCE AND THAT'S WHAT I WOULD I WOULD ASK YOU ALL TO. COME TO HELP US CONSIDER AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS NUMBER ONE IN SAN DIEGO WE NEED TO LEARN THE LESSON THE POWER DOWN GRITS. RIGHT. NOW WHICH ARE LINKED WITH NATURAL WEATHER SERVICE ANOTHER'S NUMBER TWO OAKLAND HILLS UNDERGROUND IN SPECIFIC AREAS LINKED WITH THE SIREN SYSTEM THAT HAD TRAINING THEY STILL HAVE THOSE CERTEON IS OUT THERE. THAT ARE MANAGING A A SIREN SYSTEM IN THERE DOING OTHER THINGS. THREE CAMERA SYSTEMS INFRARED CAMERA SYSTEMS THAT WOULD IT'S LOOKING LIKE WE'RE APPLYING FOR. OF THE FEMUR HAZARD MITIGATION GRANT PROGRAM TO DO TWO TO THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN INFRARED FIRE CAMERA CYCLE ON TOP OF AN EXISTING ANTENNA ARRAY. IN OUR AREA THAT'S DEPLOYED IN RENO THAT ALLOWS YOU TO ALSO REDUCE THE COSTS OF OF OF WHEN A CALL COMES IN ITS FIREFIGHTERS HAVING TO GO CHECK EVERYTHING. NUMBER FOUR. IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD ALREADY THEN THE P. JEANNIE SHOULD BE TELLING YOU WHAT WHAT THEY'RE PLANNING WITH THEIR FIRE SEASON IN THEIR TIER THREE AREAS. THERE LOOKING TO DO FOURTEEN TO FIFTEEN FEET ON EACH SIDE. BY IN BETWEEN NOW AND REALLY SEPTEMBER IN OUR AREAS AND THROUGHOUT MANY OF YOUR DISTRICTS. AND GOING IN AND. IN REMOVING ALL THAT BRUSH INSTEAD OF LEAVING IT LIKE THEY DID BEFORE. AND SO YOU LOOK THROUGH THESE THINGS AND THEN WHAT WOULD WE NEED TO DO WELL WE NEED TO HAVE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ORDINANCES. YOU KNOW THAT ARE JUST FOCUSED ON LITTLE POPULATION AREAS BUT IF YOU'RE AN ABSENTEE LANDOWNERS AND SOME OF THE AREAS IN ARE DISTRICTS AND YOU DON'T HAVE GRAZING AND YOU DON'T HAVE. YOU KNOW PRESCRIBED BURNING OR OTHER STUFF YOUR PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHT IT GETS CONFLICTING AGAINST YOUR PRIVATE PROPERTY RESPONSIBILITY. SO JUST FINAL THING IS IN IN YOU'D LEADERSHIP UNLIKE COUNTING WITH YOU ALL. AS I MET WITH SOME OF YOUR FOLKS WHO THERE THAT THE ONE AREA LEFT TO BURN THERE IS A BETWEEN HOP FLUENT. IN THE LAKE AND SO THEY HAVE A NINE THOUSAND ACRE PRESCRIBED BURN THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO GO AFTER TIME AND AGAIN AND THEY HAVE THE PERMITS FOR. INTO TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT THING FOR IT RIGHT SO THEY'RE LEADING THE CHARGE EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE BEHIND ON RESOURCES. AND I THINK WE NEED THE YOU KNOW AS A PART OF OUR WORK WITH CAL FIRE AND OTHERS. IS WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT THIS WORLD OF I WOULD ASK YOU ALL TO HELP US. IT IS IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT MONEY IT'S HELPING US WITH THE PERMITS ON ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS WHETHER IT BACH MED. OR NORTHERN POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF GHGS FROM LIKE WHEN. GRACE BENNETT AND JUDY. MORRIS FROM TRINITY AND SISKIYOU EVEN KICK STATE OF JEFFERSON FOLKS ARE LIKE WE DON'T EVEN AGREE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE EXISTS BUT WE DO AGREE THAT IN THESE MOST RECENT RASH OF FIRES. WE RELEASED BOARD GHGS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE THAT WE COULD OF OVER OVER THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS. SO THINGS LIKE THAT MEAN WE DON'T WANT SEQUEL EXEMPTIONS THAT SCARE US. YOU OR SCARE YOU ALL BUT STUFF LIKE THAT WHERE YOU CAN DO GOOD IS DESPERATELY NEED. AND HERE I THINK TO ALL OF YOUR POINTS AND YOU YOU EACH TALK ABOUT SCALING UP RIGHT AND. OR IN SOME WAY ABOUT WE'VE SEEN THIS IS THIS ISN'T JUST ONE CITY ONE COUNTY THIS IS MUCH BIGGER AND WERE ALL RUNNING ACROSS THE SAME THEMES. ANTS AT SOME OF WHAT YOU'VE TOUCHED ON IS REFLECTED IN THIS HANDOUT THAT WAS GIVEN WITH. FORTY BILLS US SORRY FORTY FOUR AND COUNTING. FLAT A FORTY FOUR BILLS IN ACCOUNTING. AND THAT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED I THINK THAT THAT'S UNPRECEDENTED ON IN TERMS OF IMPACTING SOME OF THESE AREAS WHETHER YOU DESCRIBE THE INSURANCE. THE DEBRIS REMOVAL WHICH HAS BECOME AN EVERYDAY WORD FOR ALL OR TERM FOR ALL OF US AND. I. MANAGEMENT PLAN STATEWIDE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT IMPACT TO THE ENVIRONMENT BUT THE TRADE OFFS I THINK ALL OF THAT IS REFLECTED IN AND IN MOST OF THESE BILLS. UP BUT YOU DO EMPHASIZE THE POINT OVER AND OVER THAT AT THIS ISN'T JUST APPLYING TO ONE AREA THAT THIS IS BROADER I'M I WAS STRUCK BY. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE WATERSHED MARINES. THAT AND THE FACT THAT. DOT IS ONE EXAMPLE OF AREAS WHERE I THINK ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES COULD HAVE DONE BETTER I KNOW THAT I RECEIVED CALLS FROM NAG. SAYING WE WANT REALLY BASIC THINGS AND WE DON'T KNOW WHO TO GO TO SOMEONE SAYS IT'S. THE. YEAH CAN YOU KNOW THAT RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS OTHER FOLKS A KNOW ITS FEMALE AND NO IT'S THE COUNTY AND AND. WHAT ARE THE STATE WE WERE GOING BACK AND FORTH BUT I THINK YOU'VE RAISED THE IDEA THAT REALLY WE DO HAVE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT? THE SCALE OF THIS AND WHO TO GO TO. AND WHAT'S THE RIGHT ENTITY BUT BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT THERE WERE. I MEAN WITH THE LIST CAN GO ON A ON WHETHER IT'S AN ALARM SYSTEM OUR NOTIFICATION SYSTEM. WATERSHEDS. CON I THINK WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE LABOR MARKET AND CONTRACTING AND EVERYONE'S TALKED ABOUT INSURANCE. IN THIS. AND SO I THINK THAT THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S SOME WORK TO BE DONE BUT I I HOPE THAT IN THESE FORTY FOUR BILLS AND COUNTING. ON THE IS THAT SOME OF THAT IS REFLECTED IN IN THIS. AS I'M A WOOD. YET THEN THESE ARE KIND OF A. THE DIVERSION FROM SOME WERE TALKING ABOUT BUT I'M I'M THINKING SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE HERE AS FAR AS WHAT SOME OF THE MORE LONG TERM EFFECTS AS WELL AND THAT'S. I COME WITH YOU KNOW FROM BOTH SANTA BARBARA COUNTY IN AND THEN SNOW COUNTY. THAT THE THE NUMBER OF HOMES THAT ARE OR ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEFT THE AREA. AND HOW MANY ARE HOW MANY WE LOST. AND THEN AND THEN ALSO. IF SOMEONE CAN SUCH ON THE WHAT WHAT WHAT I'M WILL ALL REFER TO AS SORT OF THE SECONDARILY DISPLACED FOLKS THE FOLKS THAT. JUST. GOT BOOTED OUT QUITE FRANKLY. WHAT SANTA BARBARA COUNTY ARE IMPACT IS LARGE OBVIOUSLY AS CINEMA BUT LIKE I SAID OVER? FIVE HUNDRED WHERE I AM DAMJAN ASTRIDE NAY THINK EHRLICH TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN WERE RED TAGGED AND SO YOU SEE SOME OF THAT STILL UP THERE THAT PEOPLE HAVE MOVED BACK. AND. IN THIS AREA WE THE PEOPLE OF CHOICES. AND SO THE WORRY THAT WE HAVE IS NOT GOING TO WANT TO MOVE BACK AND IF THEY DON'T TO GO THROUGH THE ISSUES THAT. I JUST TALKED ABOUT THAT SO THAT OTHER WORRY AND SO TRYING TO KEEP THE COMMUNITY TOGETHER AND ENGAGED. BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO COME TO COMMUNITY MEETINGS I KNOW I WANT TO REBUILD. I WANT TO STAY HERE AND SO IT'S REALLY DEPENDING IT'S TRYING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THE COMMUNITY ENGAGED ON THE SECONDARY. ISSUES WE ARE EXPERIENCE ARE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE WE HAVE. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO WORKS. DISTRICTS STRUGGLING TO RENTING COURSE SERVING THAT COMMUNITY AND SO THEY'VE BEEN DISPLACED IN THEIR JOBS. PEOPLE THINK THAT IT'S JUST A VERY SHE SHE AREA IT IS BUT THERE'S A LOT OF SERVICE WORKERS AS WELL AND SO WE'RE SEEING A LOT INCOME THROUGH OUR RECOVERY CENTER. I'M LOOKING FOR ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE. AND THAT CONTINUES TO BE A STRUGGLE FOR US WE'VE ALL THE SBA LOANS AND ALL THE FEMA INDIVIDUAL ASSISTANCE ALL OF THAT HAS OCCURRED. WE HAD. R. BLATTNER PHILANTHROPIC COMMUNITY GIVEN MONEY TO OUR UNITED WAY AND THEY'RE RELEASING THAT MONEY IN THAT PURE DISCLOSED PRESS AGAINST WE'VE DONE ANOTHER SURGE OF TRYING TO APPLICATIONS OUT. BUT IT IS A STRUGGLE. THE ON THE NUMBER SIDE IS TWO THINGS THAT. YOU KNOW WERE FORCED TO KIND OF USE MACRO NUMBERS TO TRYING TO ESTIMATE TOO OFTEN. LIKE FOR INSTANCE THE FACT THAT ONLY TWENTY NINE PERCENT OF RENTERS HAVE UNTIL ENSURE. IN THE CINEMA COUNTY MODEL AND SO. SECONDLY IS THE FACT THAT IN BOTH IN IN IN THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE AREA THIRTY NINE PERCENT OF THE ENTIRE HOMES LOST FIFTY THREE HUNDRED. WERE. WERE RENTERS AS WELL RIGHT SO THE RENTERS AS IT WAS DESCRIBED TO US BY SOME OF THE FEMALE HOUSING FOLKS. IT'S VERY HARD TO TRACK THEM BECAUSE THEY KIND OF PEOPLE WHO THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE COLLEGE STUDENTS AND RENTERS THEY ARE FULL TIME HOME RENTERS RIGHT. SO THEY KIND OF MOVE AND I MEAN IT WAS FUNNY TO HEAR ME EVEN TALK ABOUT OF THE FEMA HOUSING SPECIALIST. A ONE THING I DO WANT TO SAY IS THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO YOU ALL IS. WERE WORKING WITH ONE OF THE FOUNDATIONS AND CINEMA COUNTY RIGHT NOW TO DO PRETTY VERY EXPENSIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE STUDY TO TRACK THAT SO IT CAN AND FORMER DECISION MAKING. THIS IS NOT THE TIPPING POINT ONE BUT IT'S SIMILAR TO THAT THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY BRING IN A RESEARCH GROUP THAT TO TRY AND HELP US. WITH LIKE TO BEGIN NO ON TIME DECISION MAKING THAT THIS IS HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE LEAVING BECAUSE AS YOU SAID IT'S IS. ONLY AS ONLY ANECDOTAL ONCE AGAIN BUT PERSONALLY I'VE HAD AT LEAST FIFTEEN PEOPLE CONTACT MY OFFICE. WHICH MIGHT SEEM LIKE A LOW NUMBER BUT LET'S SAY ONE OUT OF EVERY. FIFTY OR A HUNDRED DECIDES TO CONTACT A GOVERNMENT OFFICE TO SAY I'VE BEEN I'VE HAD TO MOVE OUT OF MY HOME BECAUSE EITHER THE LANDLORDS WHO LOST HER HOME MOVED BACK. OR THE INSURANCE HERE'S THE THING PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE PAYING IN BETWEEN SIX AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH TO HOUSE PEOPLE. EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT PAYING PEOPLE BACK. AT A HIGH LEVEL FOR REBUILD THEY SEE THEY HAVE A HUGE LIABILITY IF THEY DON'T FIND YOU HOUSING LOCALLY. SO THE PAIN NOT MUCH IN ITS FORCING THIS OUT AND SO WE HAD A WOMAN WHO WAS A. IT WAS AT THE CATTLEMEN'S WHAT IS A HOSTESS AT THE CATTLEMEN'S WHO GLENN JULY TO GOD REST HIS SOUL CALLS ME UP AND SAYS. A MATTER THE OTHER NIGHT SHE'S THE HOSTESS THERE AND SHE CAN AFFORD. PROBABLY EIGHTEEN HUNDRED BUCKS A MONTH. SLEEP IN HER CAR IN FRONT OF A QUE WAY RIGHT. I KNOW THAT'S ANECDOTAL BUT IT IS HAPPENING. SO. LEARNED SO MUCH BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE WORK WITH YOU GUYS TO SPREAD THIS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. A FINAL THING IS WHEN WE MET TO REVIEW OUR INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT DONE BY. YES ON OUR. ON OUR LEARNING SYSTEM. BY DIRECTOR KILLER DUDE SHE AND TWO OF HIS OTHER FOLKS SAID THEY SAID YOU GOTTA REALIZE THAT WE DID A STATEWIDE SURVEY AND I NEVER HEARD OF THIS AND THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ABOUT PREPAREDNESS. AND LIKE MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS DON'T DON'T EVEN REACH THE FIRST ROUND OF PREPAREDNESS WHICH IS UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S RISK IN THEIR LIVES. YOU KNOW SO THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO KIND OF SAY NOBODY'S PREPARED FOR THIS AND YET WE'RE IN THE NEW NORMAL. AND SO NO MATTER WHAT WE DO WITH WIRELESS ALERTS AND OTHER THINGS. WE GOT TO GET BACK TO BASICS SO ON HELP US HELP YOU FIGURE THAT OUT. FED THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER I I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ASKING THE THE QUESTION BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE PARTS OF. THIS CONVERSATION THAT TENDS TO GET LOST FROM THE CITY AND FROM THE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE IS WERE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME FOCUSING ON HOW TO HELP THE FOLKS THAT LOST THEIR HOMES. AND NOT. AND NOT ENOUGH TIME TALKING ABOUT THE MACRO EFFECTS THAT'S HAVING IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE'VE DONE A SURVEY BY THE OR THE UNITED POLICY HOLDERS HAVE DONE A SURVEY THAT SHOWED ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE FOLKS THAT LOST THEIR HOMES. IN THE FIRE. WERE UNDER INSURED BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON AVERAGE. AND WE EXPECT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN A THIRD TO A HALF TO NOT REBUILD. THERE ARE MANY HAVE MOVED THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITY. MANY HAVE LEFT AND I KNOW OUR SCHOOL BOARD IS A LITTLE BIT TERRIFIED THAT WHEN THE SCHOOL YEAR IS OVER AND THE KIDS ARE NO LONGER HOLDING THE FAMILIES THERE THAT THAT'S WHEN WE'LL SEE DISPLACEMENT AS WELL. BUT OVER ALSO SAYING IS FOR BECAUSE WE IN SANTA ROSA HAVE LESS THAN A ONE PERCENT VACANCY RATE FOR RENTERS. RANCHERS ARE BEING DISPLACED BY FOLKS WHO INSURANCE WILL PAY MORE FOR. AND OTHERS WHO WERE LIVING ON THE MARGINS A RIGHT BETWEEN BEING ABLE TO AFFORD A PLACE TO LIVE IN BEING LIVING IN THEIR CAR ARE ALSO BEING PUSHED FURTHER OUT AND SO WE'VE SEEN RANCHERS DISPLACED WE'VE SEEN. A MORE OF A HOMELESS BOOM AND SANTA ROSA IN PARTICULAR THAT WE HAD BEFORE THESE WERE ISSUES THAT WE ARE STRUGGLING WITH. AND THEN JUST SORT ABOUT THE LAST NOTED THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS POINT ABOUT US ALL TALKING ABOUT THIS AS A REGIONAL ISSUE I SERVE ON THE MAYORS AND COUNCIL MEMBERS LEGISLATIVE TASK FORCE. ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM EACH CITY IN THE COUNTY AND WE DON'T MEET AT ALL ANYMORE WITHOUT ME HEARING FROM THOSE COUNCIL MEMBERS ABOUT HOW WE ARE SUCKING IN. RESOURCES INTO SANTA ROSA THAT ARE ALSO MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO COMPLETE THEIR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT WERE ALREADY UNDER WAY OR WERE GETTING UNDER WAY. SO IT'S NOT JUST SAN AROSE IT'S NOT JUST THE COUNTY OF CINEMA BUT REALLY A REGIONAL PROBLEM THAT'S DISPLACING FOLKS AND PREVENTING US FROM BEING ABLE TO BUILD THE LIMITED HOUSING WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PERMIT. IS FOR US MISTER KNIPE OREGON. IN MISMATCHED MINNESOTA'S WELL ON. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY WITH THE SOME MEMBER LIMON TURNED TOWARD MINUS YOU KNOW AND BILLY WAS FOR SMALL IMPRESSED ABOUT THE COUNTY OPERATION THAT YOU HAD AT YOUR FOLLOWER. HOUSE AND THE PUSH OUT OF. SOCIAL WORKERS IN PARTICULAR OPTICALLY FOR FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN USED TO ASKING FOR HELP OR DIDNOT KNOW HOW TO. ORGANIZE AND PRIORITIZE HOW TO DO THAT. AFTER NOT NEEDING TO ASK FOR HELP FOR A LOT OF THEIR LIVES AND I WAS IMPRESSED BY THAT ALSO. FRIGHTENED BY THE FACT THAT THAT WAS THE DAY THAT THE FEMA CREW PACKED UP AND LEFT. AND I THOUGHT I ALREADY BECAUSE ON THAT TOUR. IT'S REALLY AYE OPENING FOR FOR SOMEONE THAT REPRESENTS IN THE COUNTY THAT TO GO DOWN THERE AND SEE WHAT. THAT THE DESTRUCTION WAS LIKE THERE SO WE SAW A LOT OF IMAGES. WHERE HOMES? LOOKED BEAUTIFUL THERE THERE MAYBE IS A. A LINE OF WHERE. THE MUD SLIDE WENT TWO SOMETIMES I THINK IT WAS ABOVE OUR HEADS. YEAH. AND AS I YOU KNOW WALKED IN APPROACHED THE WINDOW OF ONE OF THE HOMES I REALIZED HOW HIGH I WAS. IT WAS LOOKING DOWN INTO THE WINDOW. AND THAT WHEN I WAS LOOKING DOWN INTO THE WINDOW THAT THE MUD WAS KITCHEN COUNTER DEPTH HIGH. AND. AND SO YOU MIGHT LOOK. YOU KNOW FRONT FROM ANOTHER. PERSPECTIVE OF WHILE THE HOMES ARE STILL OUT. NO WHAT IS WHAT'S THE ISSUE WHERE IT WHERE YOU KNOW IT WE WANT TO COPY PARK IN SANTA ROSA AND THERE'S IT'S LIKE A WAR FIELD. ABOUT FIELD BUT. I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW ANYONE RECOVERS FROM AT YOU KNOW ONE HOW DID THE MIGHT FIND ITS WAY INTO THE HOME SO PERFECTLY LIKE IT WAS BUILT THEIR DOOR OPENED AND THEY WERE JUST GIVEN A TOUR. AND. IN IT IS THAT IS THAT REALLY A AT THAT HOUSE TOTALED BUT IS THERE A WAY TO REMEDIAL EIGHT SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE WE WAS MANY MONTHS LATER IS MAYBE FOUR MONTHS LATER THAT WE DID THAT TOUR. AND HOMEOWNER GAVE US THE TOUR. AND. I WANT TO KNOW WHERE TO START OF COURSE. YEAH SO CAN GIVE US A SENSE ABOUT THAT SO SO YOU KNOW US FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA OR MEMBERS ARE NOT FROM SANTA BARBARA CAN GET A SENSE OF THE SCALE OF THAT THAT DESTRUCTION. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR THE QUESTION IT'S A GOOD ONE. IT'S DE THAT IS SO EVEN WHEN THE HOUSE IS THREE OR FOUR FEET DEEP IN MUD AND DEBRIS. THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF VALUE THERE THAT CAN BE SALVAGED SO THE FOUNDATION THE FRAME. IN MANY CASES WHAT WE CALL THE ANY PIECE OF MECHANICAL ELECTRICAL AND PLUMBING SYSTEMS ARE ARE ARE DAMAGED BUT DEFINITELY. REPAIRABLE. THE STILL REFUND THE BUILDING AT THE ROOF DOESN'T LEAK. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT DOORS AND WINDOWS. HAVE NOT BEEN IMPACTED BY THEM I DO KNOW THAT THE BUDGET FOR MY DIDN'T GET THAT HIGH WORTH MIGHT HIT ONE SIDE OF THE BUILDING BUT NOT THE OTHER. AND YOU KNOW THOSE ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF MAJOR COSTS. IN THE IN THE OVERALL VALUE OF THE BUILDING. WHICH. BY RAISING THE BUILDING ENTIRELY WE WOULD WE WOULD. THEN BE FORCED TO REPLACE. OUR OUR ABILITY TO CONSIDER THAT OPTION IT IS FURTHER LIMITED BY THE FACT THAT WHEN THE INSURANCE CARRIER SEES THAT VALUE. PRESERVED ON THE PROPERTY THEY WILL NOT SUPPORT. IT YOU KNOW THINK THAT CLAIM INCLUDING THE REPLACEMENT. OF THAT VALUE AND SO AND IN MANY WAYS WE HAVE A CHOICE BUT TO SALVAGE WHATEVER PARTS THE BUILDING WE CAN BECAUSE. WE CAN ONLY GET BE OUR RESOURCES IN THE FORM OF AN INSURANCE SETTLEMENT. TO REPLACE WHAT HAS TRULY BEEN DAMAGED. THAT BEING SAID. TO REMOVE. OF A BUILDING FROM THE LANDSCAPE ENTIRELY IS THE CHORE OF A PIECE OF HEAVY MACHINERY TO REMOVE THREE FEET ABOUT FROM THE INSIDE OF THE HOUSE WHILE LEAVING THE HOUSE AND TAX IS THE CHORE OF. A GROUP OF TWENTY MEN AND WOMEN WITH SHOVELS AND WHEELBARROWS. AND SO IT'S IT'S A CHALLENGE TO SAY THE LEAST ARE ALSO POINT OUT TO YOU. JUST TO. AGAINST HAVE A SIZE AND ON YOUR SURPRISE. AT THE WAY THAT THAT NIGHT HAS FOUND ITS WAY INTO THE BUILDING. MOTHERS FOUND ITS WAY INTO THE BUILDING ASSEMBLIES AND MANY CASES SO WE HAVE FOUND MUD INSIDE OF WALL CAVITIES. WE FOUND THAT MUD HAS GOTTEN. INTO THE WEEK SCREED WHICH OF THE YOU KNOW THE WE'VE HOLES FOR. MOISTURE TO ESCAPE FROM STUCCO CITING. SUMMIT HAS FLOWED DE UNIVERSE THROUGH THE THROUGH THE WEED SCREED AND INFILTRATED BEHIND THE STUCCO. BETWEEN THE BUILDING PAPER ON THE STUCCO BETWEEN BILLION PAPER IN THE FRAMING. BECAUSE JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE WE FOUND BY THEN ELECTRICAL JUNCTION BOXES. INSIDE OF. PLUMBING PIPES AND SO THERE'S THIS REALLY. QUITE A LOT OF DETAIL WORK THAT COMES ABOUT WHEN. WE JUST TO SALVAGE THE BUILDING SO IT'S IT'S BOTH. I THINK A BLESSING AND A CURSE. THAT. THAT THESE BUILDINGS AREN'T TOTAL LOSSES. BUT WOULD YOU REALLY RUN THE NUMBERS YOU FIND THAT THOSE. THAT THAT THAT THAT VALUE. IN MANY CASES IS ABSOLUTELY WORTH PRESERVING. SO ESSENTIAL YOU CAN BRING IT DOWN OF THE STATS. TATE OR TAKE THE CITING OFF OF THE BUILDING. IT YEAH THAT'S IN IN SHORT. WE CAN OFTEN WE WE CAN OFTEN CUT YOU KNOW ONE OR TWO FEET ABOVE THE FLOOD LINE. AND SELL EITHER IS HOMES HAVE DRY WALL YOU KNOW FROM THREE OR FOUR FEET UP. BUT YOU KNOW FROM THERE DOWN THERE OPEN STUDS. THERE'S A. A CLEANING AND SANITATION PROTOCOL. THAT GOES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BUILDING. FRAME IS FREE OF CONTAMINANTS AND BACTERIAL. GROWTH AND SO ON. BEFORE WE CAN PUT THE BUILDING BACK TOGETHER. AND THAT IS THAT IS I WOULD SAY. BY AND LARGE THE STEP THAT THAT WE'VE WE'VE JUST COMPLETED BUT MOST OF THESE PROJECTS AND SO IT'S IT'S BEEN THAT LONG IN COMING. MEDIUM PARA WE HAVE ALL OF THE INSURANCE TO GO SHE SINCE THE PERMANENT CHALLENGES THAT I WAS. DISCUSSING BUT. IT'S A IT'S A PAINSTAKING PROCESS AND AND VERY LABOR INTENSIVE. TO SET ASIDE WAS IMPRESSED BY THAT THE INTEGRITY OF THE STRUCTURES GIVEN. THE SPEED AND FORCE BY WHICH THAT MUD SLOWED DOWN. THE HILL AND IN AND OUT DOWN THAT ROAD. YET I THINK THERE'S SOME LESSONS. IN RESILIENCE THEIR. YOU KNOW WE HAVE MANY EXAMPLES OF. YOU KNOW ONE HOUSE SAVING ANOTHER. OR A GARDEN WALL OR EVEN A FENCE LINE. SAVING HOUSE. OF SUBSIDED I KNOW THAT MANY THE COUNTY PLANNERS ARE AT HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS. AROUND TAMANA SEAT OF BECOMING A WALLED CITY. IF FROM HERE ON OUT AND THERE ARE. YOU KNOW THERE'S CERTAIN TYPES OF GARDEN WALLS THAT CAN BE BUILT WITHOUT. TENDING OVERSIGHT AND PLANNING REVIEW. AND SO HOMEOWNERS HAVE A CERTAIN FREEDOM THERE THAT MAY END UP. COMING BACK AND AND BITING US AS A COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE CAN ONLY CHANNEL LIES. FUTURE TO PROPOSED SAID SO. THOUGHT YOU TO SUCH AN EXTENT BEFORE IT BECOMES A REAL. A COMPLICATED PROBLEM YEAH THERE'S ALSO THE RANDOMNESS OF. THE HOME NEXT DOOR ACROSS THE STREET IS COMPLETELY UNTOUCHED WHILE THE OTHER HOMES ALL HAD THE BIG BOULDERS. JUST PARKED RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YARD. YEAH. THE LEADING ABOUT THE PHYSICS OF OF DEBRIS FLOWS. BUT BUT THEY ARE VERY DISCREET YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE STRUCTURE TO THEM AND HEIGHT AND SO THE. KNOWS THE PREFLIGHT MOVE THROUGH TOWN AS A AS A AS A DISCREET. YOU KNOW FLOW AND AND DEFINITE HAD BOUNDARIES SO. IF I GIVES ADD REALLY QUICK SO ON THE MUD. THE ONE THING ABOUT MONEY CEO IN A LOT OF AREAS WHERE. AN ENTIRE IT'S AN ALLUVIAL FAN. THAT'S THAT RIGHT SO THAT THE THE DEBRIS HAS COME DOWN OVER HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND SPREAD OUT. A FAN. MODESTY WAS BUILT ON THAT. SO YOU SEE THESE BIG BOULDERS IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY ROCKY NICK PARK IT'S BECAUSE A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THERE ISN'T THE BEHOLDERS CAME DOWN. SO THE MUD AS OUR OWN OUR OEM DIRECTOR SAYS. I'M ALL MOUNDS ONE TO BECOME BEACHES. THE TO THE SOIL ON THE MAT WANTS TO COME DOWN AND FLOW TO THE TO THE OCEAN SO. HARD THAT IS. IF THE DIFFICULT LESSON FOR ALL OF US BUT THAT IS TRUE IT'S IT'S A SYSTEM ALLUVIAL FAN THAT'S HOW IT. IT'S BEEN DEVELOPED OVER TIME SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE CAN. NECESSARILY STOP UNFORTUNATELY. YES DOT ANOTHER POINT MR DE HAS HAD DEPART. BY TODD YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT. TWENTY PEOPLE WHEELBARROWS. SOME REALLY. HARD LABOR. THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING IN IN DIFFICULT SPACES. HOW IS IT THAT IN YOUR EXPERIENCE WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO RECRUIT THAT LABOR? HOW'S THAT GOING. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT. LABOR IS A VERY SCARCE RESOURCE RIGHT NOW. SO WITH A. AND WITH RESPECT THE JONES COMMENTS HAS NOT BEEN ARE BOOTS ON THE GROUND EXPERIENCE. YOU NO RECOGNIZING AS WELL THAT THAT THE TYPE OF LABOR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS IT'S NOT A HIGH SKILL. TOOK TO RUN A SHOVEL. AND AND AND FRANKLY WITH HONESTY. THAT TYPE OF LABOR'S. PERHAPS NOT THE FOCUS OF OF THE UNION HALLS. BUT THAT BEING SAID. AYE AYE YOU RESPECT AND I'M ENCOURAGED THAT THEY BUY HELP US FILL THAT GAP BUT IT IT HAS BEEN. IT HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR US. THE. THE CHARACTER OF THAT TYPE OF LABOR THAT WERE GOING TO NEED THOUGH IS GOING TO SHIFT TOWARDS THE MORE SKILLED TRADES AS WE MOVE INTO THE RECONSTRUCTION PHASE SO AGAIN IN OF THE. AT LEAST AT LEAST WITHIN THE SAMPLE SET THAT OUR CLIENTS REPRESENT. TO THE THE THE HEAVY CLEAN UP PHASES SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE ACROSS MOST OF THOSE PROJECTS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON. AND WE ARE NOW. LOOKING FORWARD TO REBUILDING. AND SO WE WILL BE LOOKING FOR. HIGHER STILL TRAYS WITH THE. VIVID DEFROSTER OF SUBCONTRACTORS IN THE REGION. BUT THEY THAT THERE'S THERE'S LITTLE DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THEY. DO NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH THE COMING SURGE OF WORK AND SO YOU KNOW WHEN THE WHEN THE MAPPING IS COMPLETE. AND WHEN THE. PERMITTING A FLOODGATE CAN CAN THEREFORE OPEN. SO TO SPEAK REALLY SEE. WAVE OF WORK COMING IN THAT AND. AND AND A REAL PROBLEM AROUND LABOR AVAILABILITY EQUIPMENT AVAILABILITY. AT AND I THINK MATERIALS WERE REALLY REALLY PRIMARILY FOCUS ON LABOR. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BEFORE WE CLOSE. I WILL GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT. TESTING ABOUT PATRICK AND CALENDAR FROM THE ASHES UP AND UP FROM THE ASHES IS A COALITION OF ABOUT SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED. FIRE AND MUCH LIKE VICTIMS BOTH FROM THE NORTH BAY FIRES AND FROM VENTURA SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. DAHLE ALSO INCLUDES MANY THE LAW FIRMS THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THAT INCLUDING THE LAW FIRM THAT REPRESENTS CITY OF SANTA ROSA CINEMA COUNTY. VENTURA. NAPA COUNTY AND SANTA BARBARA COUNTY SO UP VERY QUICKLY MY WIFE AND I WERE FIRE VICTIMS. DUTIES PRESIDENTS NAM STATE UNIVERSITY ARE STORIES BEEN PRETTY WELL DISCUSSED. WE WOKE UP AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TO OCCUR THE HOUSE ON FIRE. ESSENTIALLY THE SMOKE ALARM SAVED OUR LIVES WE RAN OUT HAD A RUN ABOUT EIGHT TENTHS OF A MILE. BOXER SHORTS NO. CLASSES JUDY IN A ROBE INTO OCT DUTY FIREMAN SAVED OUR LIVES SOLAR SYSTEM CHANGES FRANKLY I WOULD JUST TAKE A POLICE CAR JUST SAY GET OUT NOW. STEP LIKE THAT BUT WE HAD CELL PHONES AND ALL THAT THEY'D IN ALERT. AND IF A UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT LOBBYISTS IS HAVING A TOUGH TIME TO MOVE FIVE TIMES. WE'VE HAD A TOUGH TIME PLAN IN PLACE TO RENT. AND I ONE EVEN TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE PAYING THE GALA GENE THAT'S GONE ON WITH THE NET SO THAT NOT NOT ONE A YEAR FORTY FOUR BILLS. BUT CERTAINLY AN ISSUE THAT TAKES PLACE IN THIS AS WELL. WE ARE SUBSTANTIALLY APART WITH OUR INSURANCE COMPANY AGAIN. IF YOU'RE FROM COPY PARKING A RENTER AND NO INSURANCE. BUT THOSE TWO CONTRACTORS SAY NURTURANCE COMPANIES BUT VERY QUICKLY. AS YOU GO THROUGH. IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER TWO THIRDS OF VICTIMS ARE UNDERINSURED. SELLERS NINETY FIVE HUNDRED VICTIMS BETWEEN BUSINESSES AND ANNOUNCE BETWEEN THE FOUR OR FIVE COUNTIES TWO THIRDS ARE UNDERINSURED. UNITED POLICY SAYS THE AVERAGE IS THREE A THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. IT WILL MATTER WHETHER THEY REBUILD MOVE WHETHER THEY'D WE CAN HIRE THE CONSTRUCTION LABORS. IF YOU CHANGE. AS THE UTILITIES PROPOSING INVERSE CONDEMNATION. HAS BEEN PROPOSED SPECIFICALLY. THEN IT'S IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE DON'T GET THAT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION SO WE WANT TO QUICKLY RESTORE THIS LET'S KEEP THE CURRENT LIABILITY STANDARDS AS THEY ARE. WITHIN IT. BUT THE OTHER POINT THAT THEY'RE NOT AND I'VE LEARNED THIS FROM THE LAWYERS OF INVOLVING THESE FIRES. IS THE BEST WAY IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW FIRES OR MUDSLIDES ARE CREATED. AND. IF YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THEN THERE ARE WAY SAN DIEGO ELECTRIC FROM THE CEDAR FIRE AS WAS MENTIONED LARGE ITS LESSON. FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THEY REPLACE POLLS THAT PUT METAL POLES AND THE PUT THE BLOCKERS AND THEY TOOK THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT THAT HAD WE NOT ONE DISASTER. TWO THIRDS OF FIRES ARE CAUSED BY UTILITIES SO WE CAN LEARN FROM THAT TAKE ONE OF YOUR BILLS WITHIN THAT. PUT THE CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE DONE MEASURE IT WHETHER IT'S CAL FIRE. WERE TOLD CAL FIRE SHOULD HAVE ITS REPORT DONE ABOUT A MONTH. THAT WE THINK THOSE ARE WAYS TO ADDRESS IT. WHETHER THE STATE GENERAL FUND HELPS SET SANTA ROSA GENERAL'S THE SCHOOLS ARE ALSO DAMAGED SONOMA STATE. THAT'S A WAY TO KIND IMMEDIATELY TAKE CARE OF SOME OF THOSE ISSUES THAT WE WANT TO BE PART OF THAT DISCUSSION. BUT WE'RE HERE JUST TO MAKE SURE WANNA WORK WITH YOU IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY WE ARE VICTIMS AND WE WANT TO MAKE HELP YOU IN A WAY AND THANK YOU FOR THIS COMMITTEES HAVE BEEN AMAZING DISCUSSION. IS COMPLICATED MANY VARIABLES WITHIN IT WITH BOARDED SCOTT WORKING WITH. AND FREQUENT QUESTION A QUESTION. YOU MENTIONED CAO GENE BECAUSE THAT IS SOMETHING WE ARE WORKING ON WHAT KIND OF GET WHAT DO YOU. ARE YOU TIME THAT RANK COUNTING. WELL I THINK. I THINK ANY YOU KNOW SUPERVISOR GORE I THINK STRESSED A LOT BY THE WAY. CITY OF SANTA ROSA SONOMA COUNTY FEMA'S BEEN FANTASTIC. WITH AND I JUST WANNA. SO THEY HAVE OF WHAT IS TO TEN PERCENT PROVISION IT'S EITHER COUNTY OR CITY AS WELL. A WITHIN IT. AND THEY'VE GOT THE DIEGO ON IT AND ARE MEASURING THAT. SO IN OUR CASE OBVIOUSLY WE NEEDED A PRESIDENT'S ENTERTAINMENT WEIRD A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. SITUATION. SO WHATPEOPLE ARE DOING IS THEY'RE BASICALLY SAYING EXACTLY RIGHT INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL PAY THIS. JUDY WE LOVE YOU WOULD LIKE TO RENT YOUR HOUSE OUR HOUSE TO YOU WE JUST LOVE YOU TO BE THERE FOR. I'D LIKE TO TALK A THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FOR TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH HOW JEAN THAT'S TAKEN PLACE AS WELL ALONG WITH THE FOUR RUNNER COPY PARK. WHERE THE WORK THAT'S COME IN AND IS TRYING TO DO? AND I DON'T KNOW I I WOULD TURN JUST THE OUR CITY COUNCILMEN AND SUPERVISOR AND CITY MANAGERS WHETHER THERE'S A STATE POLICY ON THIS. BUT. IT JUST CAP PEOPLE ARE GONNA IMMEDIATELY GO INTO IT AND TAKE ADVANTAGE AND MANY PEOPLE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT WE ACTUALLY WE NEED THE STATE. TO BE A A FROM THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE RENT CONTROL FAIL AT THE BALLOT A LESS THAN A YEAR AGO IT SO FOR ONE YEAR WE ARE NOT AS A BODY ALLOWED TO DO ANYTHING SUBSTANTIVELY SOMEWHERE TO RENT CONTROL. IN OUR JURISDICTION SO WE'VE BEEN RELIANT ON THE STATE'S EMERGENCY DECLARATION AND ON WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PIGGYBACK TO TRY TO LIMIT SOME OF THAT PRICE GOUGING THAT'S GONE ON. AND WORK I'M WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE D. A. ON ON THIS ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE SO. I'M HERE AND THE WOMEN WOULD AND THAT'S IT WAS. WE HEAR WE HEAR YOU WE WERE CONCERNED PER CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AS WELL. AND I KNOW THERE'S SOME BUDGET REQUEST FROM THE US SONOMA COUNTY AND CITY OF SANTA ROSA AND CITY SCHOOLS AND SONOMA STATEMENT. YOU KNOW THE BUDGET IN ITS STUFF CAN COME MAN QUICKLY TO SOME THAT'S GOING TO GO TO HOUSING. THANK YOU IT IF IF I COULD JUST AS A A QUICK THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO CRASH THE THE PANEL TODAY. HAS APPEARED. REPRESENTING THE CITY IN MAKING SURE THAT. WE HAVE A LOT THAT WE'VE LEARNED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SHARE THAT. THERE WAS ONE COMMENT THAT WAS MADE THAT I REALLY WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT IF I COULD CHALLENGE THIS ENTITY UP MISTER THOMPSON MENTION PRETTY EARLY ON. AYE SUMI THOMPSON ADMITS IT PRETTY EARLY ON THAT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN SANTA ROSA IS. AN INSURANCE SYSTEM THAT SET UP FOR ONE INDIVIDUAL TO LOSE THEIR HOME. AND THAT OUR. MY CONSTITUENTS YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT KNOW HOW PERSONALLY GETS. ARE NOT EQUIPPED AND DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS TO DEAL WITH MASSIVE. ECONOMIC SHIFTS IN THE SYSTEM SO THE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON AVERAGE THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE UNDER INSURED IF THEY HAD LOST THEIR HOMES ONLY. THEY WOULD BE MORE THAN MORE LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO REBUILD BUT WHEN YOU SEE A TWENTY PERCENT SHIFT IN THE COST OF LABOR THE TEN PERCENT SHIFT IN THE COST OF MATERIALS. THE WAY THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THEIR INSURANCE STRUCTURE DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR ANY OF THAT. THE WAY THAT MY CONSTITUENTS HAVE TO ITEMIZE THEIR DEDUCTIONS. IN ORDER TO BE PAID OUT THAT'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DRAIN AT THE CHAIR HAS A FANTASTIC BILL ALLOWING PEOPLE TO REBUILD THEIR HOMES USING THEIR INSURANCE DOLLARS. ON ANOTHER LOT THAT HASN'T BEEN CONTEMPLATED BEFORE AND WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE SCOPE AND THE SCALE OF WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH IS SO BIG. THAT TWO YEAR RULE FOR INSURANCE TO REBUILD IS ALSO A BIG HINDRANCE SO YOU MENTIONED THAT. YEAH YEAH EXACTLY AT YOU MENTION THERE'S THE FORTY FOUR BILLS THAT MIGHT NOT BE INCLUDING THE SENATE I THINK LAST WE HEARD FROM THAT THE TRACKING THERE'S OVER SEVENTY BILLS. A LOT OF THEM DEALING WITH THE INSURANCE ISSUES AS I'D REALLY I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL OF YOU WHO ARE WORKING ON THAT ISSUE AND REALLY HIGHLIGHT THAT THAT'S WHERE OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE STRUGGLING NOW. WE'VE MOSTLY GOTTEN OUT OF THEIR WAY WE PRODUCE PERMIT FEES EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN'T ALLOW THEM TO REBUILD BUT EIGHTY PERCENT HAVE NOT SETTLED WITH THEIR INSURANCE YET. THAT THAT'S WHERE THE FOCUS NEEDS TO BE FOR REFORM. THE OTHERS WANT AYE HITTERS ONE PIECE OF THE PANELISTS AND YEAH I. UP UNTIL IT. CHAIRMAN LEVINE TELL MADE UP TO THIS ONE PIECE OF THIS YOU KNOW THAT WE THAT WE HAVEN'T SO I CAREFULLY CALCULATED RELOCATION EXPENSE THREE YEARS. AND WE HAD ENOUGH TO DO IT. BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IS PEOPLE ARE CALCULATING FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR TWO YEARS AND IRAN OUT A RELOCATION SO EVEN IF WE EXTENDED THE FOR YEARS WHICH YOU SHOULD DO. CRITICAL AND STUFF LIKE THAT YOU CAN HELP PEOPLE GONNA RUN OUT OF THE RELOCATION EXPENSE OF TWO YEARS AND I'M NOT SURE. WHAT WE DO ABOUT THAT? CAN. ALSO JUST MAKE ONE QUICK FINAL COMMENT WHICH I MIGHT LOOK WAS GOING TO SAY THIS EARLIER BUT IT REALLY STRUCK HOME WHEN I SAW THE PICTURES FROM SANTA BARBARA AND THAT. HIS YOU KNOW FROM A FROM A WATERSHED IN AND WE TALKED ABOUT FORCE HELP THAT ONE OF THEM THE CONCERNS ON THE KEYS ME UP A LOT. ESPECIALLY IN THE WINTER IS THE FACT THAT MANY OF THE SYSTEMS WE HAVE LIKE DEBRIS. BASINS OR FLOOD CONTROL CHANNELS LIKE A SAID THEY'VE BEEN DESIGNED FOR WORLD THAT NO LONGER EXISTS. WITH CLIMATE CHANGE THIS IN THIS NEW NORMAL AND. THE ROOF WOULD REALLY LIKE TO ENCOURAGE. HERE ASSEMBLY HERE AT THIS THIS COMMITTEE TO TAKE A LOOK AT FINDING WAYS TO BOTH INTEGRATE FLOOD CONTROL SYSTEMS AND FIRE PROTECTION SYSTEMS TOGETHER THERE'S AWAY WITH WATERSHED HEALTH. WHAT I'M FORCED MANAGEMENT? DEBRIS PACE AND ALL OF THAT TO TO LOOK AT THAT AND TO AND TO POTENTIALLY IN ON JAMES AND I TALKED ABOUT THIS EARLIER. WE ARE TO HAVE A FRAMEWORK UNDER THE INTEGRATED REGIONAL WATER MANAGEMENT PLANS HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED TO THE STATE. AND POTENTIALLY USING THAT THOSE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES IN THE NORTH COAST WE HAVE THE NORTH COAST RESOURCE PARTNERSHIP USING THOSE STRUCTURES THAT GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE THAT'S BEEN WORKING REALLY WELL. AS A WAY TO LOOK AT THIS LONGER TERM RESILIENCE LONGER TERM PROTECTION OF THESE COMMUNITIES THAT I THINK ARE. ARE ARE ALL VERY VULNERABLE YOU'RE GONNA BE VULNERABLE NOT JUST FOR THREE TO FIVE YEARS IT'S. IT'S THE NEW NORMAL ITSELF. THANKS. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR PARTICIPATING THANK ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES FOR PARTICIPATING I THINK AND WE HAVE HAD ONGOING CONVERSATIONS AND. IN APPRECIATION I THINK ALSO FOR EACH OTHER FOR WHAT EVERYONE HAS LEARNED WHAT WE BROUGHT TO THE TABLE. AND NO ONE HAS HESITATED TO PICK UP THE PHONE SEND A TEXT MESSAGE TO BETTER LEARN IT SOUNDS LIKE AT THE CITY AND COUNTY LEVELS THAT'S HAPPENING AS WELL. AYE I THINK YOU'VE GIVEN US ALL I'M MORE. IT INFORMATION IT'S ADDED TO WHAT WE KNOW ON BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS YOU HAVE MENTIONED THE CONVERSATIONS ARE STILL GOING SO LONG AS THESE BILLS GO THROUGH THE PROCESS IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS WE WILL BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. AND I THINK WHAT YOU'VE ALL CONTRIBUTED AND IT IS IS A GREAT DEAL UP TO THIS CONVERSATION I'M ALSO CLEAR THAT THE SAKE OF CONVERSATION SHOULD NOT AND HERE. I HAD THAT IT NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO HAPPEN BECAUSE. EVERY TIME I THINK I KNOW WHAT I MEAN WE ARE HAVE AND LIKE ONE MORE THING COMING UP WHAT I THOUGHT WE FIXED THAT SOMEWHERE AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TO HAVE THE SPACE AND I WANNA. AT ESPECIALLY THINK UP MY CO CHAIR AT ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE. WHO YOU KNOW BROUGHT TOGETHER AND THE GROUP I HAVE FOR BRINGING US TOGETHER AND? HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. WOULD ANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES WANNA MAKE ANY COMMENTS. I JUST WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT WE'RE NOT DONE RENO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK AND I'LL NEVER FORGET WHEN THEY HAVE THE OAKLAND FIRES. AND PEOPLE THAT SUMS STUMP IS SOMETHING TO CHANGE POLICY AND THEN IT KIND OF WENT AWAY. AND WE'RE HERE WE HAVE TO BE HERE FOR THE LONG HAUL WE CAN'T FORGET SO. I A WILL COMMIT TO YOU AND I WORK WITH ALL OF YOU BEFORE NOT EVERYONE OF US TO YOU BEFORE TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WE HAVE A LOT MORE TO DO WE'RE GONNA. TRY TO MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS AND WE MIGHT HAVE TO TWEAK IT FOR THE NEXT FIVE OR TEN YEARS BLESSED TO AN ATTACK. YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN WE GOT THROUGH OCTOBER. I HAD NEVER CONTEMPLATED THAT THE FIRE SEASON WAS GOING TO CONTINUE. OR THAT. DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE THE DISASTERS THAT CALIFORNIA WOULD EXPERIENCE A CALIFORNIANS WOULD EXPERIENCE WOULD BE. THAT THE TYPES OF DISASTERS THAT WE ENDED UP HAVING LATER ON IN THE YEAR. AND. IT AND. IT WAS HORRIFYING WHEN THOSE FIRES BEGAN AGAIN IN DECEMBER THINKING WOULD. WE DID NOT GET THROUGH THIS THIS ISN'T OVER BY NOW. AND DIE AND SO YOU KNOW I'M GRATEFUL. THAT DESPITE THAT WE HAD THESE SHARED EXPERIENCES I'M GRATEFUL THAT LAWMAKERS FROM ACROSS THE STATE. AND THERE ARE MANY MORE THAN JUST THE THE FIVE OF US HERE. ARE ENGAGED ON THIS. IT'S BE IT GOES BEYOND THE MAY REVISE AND WE HAVE A BUDGET TO PASS YOU PROBABLY WANT TO SEE A FEW THINGS CHANGED AND IMPROVED. AN ADDED. AND ALSO HOW DO WE PREPARE. NOT JUST OUR OWN COMMUNITIES THAT SUFFERED SO MUCH BUT ALSO SOME THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES THAT CAN. UNFORTUNATELY SUFFER THE WAY THAT WE HAVE AND THAT WE ARE. AWAKENED TO THE US THAT WE'VE INVESTMENTS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE TO PREVENT. MORE SUFFERING TO HAPPEN ACROSS THE STATE. AND I I THINK A COMMITMENT FROM THE ASSEMBLY IN THE CREATION OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE TO SEE THIS THROUGH ITS NOT JUST A FIRE THAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR. IT'S NOT JUST A NATURAL DISASTER THAT OCCURRED IN DECEMBER IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABOUT WORKING TOGETHER AS COLLEAGUES TO MAKE SURE IS A PART OF POLICY MAKING IN A PART OF BUDGET PRIORITIES. FOR THE LEGISLATURE FOR A LONG TIME TO COME I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR MY CO CHAIR. IN HER LEADERSHIP OF THIS AS WELL ALONG WITH ALL OF THE OTHER MEMBERS AFTER THAT SUSTAINED COMMITMENT. AND OF COURSE THANK YOU TO THE PANELISTS FOR HELPING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO GO.
