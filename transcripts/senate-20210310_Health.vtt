I THINK THIS IS A AN INCREDIBLE

00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:09.212
APPROACH TO BE ABLE TO INCLUDE

00:59:41.678 --> 00:59:43.780
THE MEDICAL PROGRAM IS A

00:59:43.846 --> 00:59:45.815
FEDERAL STATE PARTNERSHIP

00:59:45.882 --> 00:59:46.849
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

00:59:46.916 --> 00:59:48.785
REIMBURSEMENT- ON THE FINANCIAL

00:59:48.851 --> 00:59:50.753

STATE ONLY SPEND A POGRAM. YES

01:00:07.303 --> 01:00:09.806
I AM AWARE THAT THIS WOULD BE-

01:00:09.872 --> 01:00:11.808
OUR STATE A STATE FUNDED

01:00:11.874 --> 01:00:13.276
PROGRAM NOT A FEDERAL FUNDED

01:00:13.343 --> 01:00:17.981

THIS POINT. AT THIS POINT WE

STATE FUNDED PROGRAM OKAY- ARE

01:00:32.929 --> 01:00:34.130
THERE ANY OTHER STATES IN THE

01:00:34.197 --> 01:00:36.065
NATION THAT HAVE A PROGRAM

01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:36.632
SIMILAR TO THIS THAT YOU'RE

01:00:36.699 --> 01:00:39.569
AWARE OF. YOU KNOW I HAVE IN MY

01:00:39.635 --> 01:00:42.705
NOTES THAT THERE ARE- SIX OTHER

01:00:42.772 --> 01:00:44.474
STATES THAT HAVE OF FOUR

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:46.776
CHILDREN- I DON'T HAVE THE

01:00:46.843 --> 01:00:49.145
EXACT A LIST OF WHO THEY ARE

01:00:49.212 --> 01:00:50.780
BUT I WOULD. I COULD PROVIDE

01:00:50.847 --> 01:00:52.882
THAT FOR YOU. THANK YOU I JUST

01:00:52.949 --> 01:00:55.385
HAVE A COUPLE MORE AND- IS

THERE ANY DOCUMENTATION THAT

01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:58.688
YOU HAVE ON ANY OF THOSE OTHER

01:00:58.755 --> 01:01:00.189
STATES THAT ARE FINDING.

01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:01.824
CHILDREN AS THIS BILL WOULD

01:01:01.891 --> 01:01:02.892
YOUR BILL WOULD COVER ADULTS

01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:04.694
BUT THE SIX STATES THAT PROVIDE

01:01:04.761 --> 01:01:07.130
FUNDING FOR CHILDREN- DO YOU

01:01:07.196 --> 01:01:08.898
SEE ACOSTA RESERVE AN ESTIMATED

01:01:08.965 --> 01:01:11.167
COST OF WHAT THAT WOULD BE FOR

01:01:11.234 --> 01:01:11.701
THAT THE TAXPAYERS OF THE

01:01:11.768 --> 01:01:14.003
STATE'S. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:17.440
IS. THAT IN THE OTHER STATES-

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:19.876
THERE'S BEEN ESTIMATES HERE IN

01:01:19.942 --> 01:01:22.678
CALIFORNIA- LAST YEAR I BELIEVE

01:01:22.745 --> 01:01:24.747
IT WAS A NINETY FIVE MILLION

01:01:24.814 --> 01:01:27.817
THE FIRST YEAR- AND UPWARDS I

01:01:27.884 --> 01:01:28.818
THINK APPROXIMATELY TWO

01:01:28.885 --> 01:01:31.154
HUNDRED. PLUS MILLION- THE

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:34.223
FOLLOWING YEARS. IT MAY HAVE

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:34.857
CHANGED BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC

01:01:34.924 --> 01:01:37.026
BUT- THAT'S MORE OR LESS I

01:01:37.093 --> 01:01:42.098
THINK. AND THANK YOU MA'AM AND-

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:43.966
ARE YOU CONCERNED AT ALL IN ANY

01:01:44.033 --> 01:01:45.401
WAY THAT THE BILL IF PASSED

01:01:45.468 --> 01:01:49.806
WOULD- IF THE BILL OF PASSED TO

01:01:49.872 --> 01:01:51.374
PROVIDE UNDOCUMENTED SWITCHED

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:52.942
OVER SIXTY FIVE WITH THIS TYPE

01:01:53.009 --> 01:01:54.977
OF BENEFITS. DO YOU SEE

01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:56.079
INDIVIDUALS COMING TO

01:01:56.145 --> 01:01:59.248
CALIFORNIA- FOR THIS BENEFIT

01:01:59.315 --> 01:01:59.849
BECAUSE IT IS A VERY GENEROUS

01:01:59.916 --> 01:02:03.152
BENEFIT. WHAT WHAT I SEE IS

01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:06.022
THAT THE PRIMARY REASON THAT

01:02:06.089 --> 01:02:08.224
IMMIGRANTS COME TO THIS COUNTRY

01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:09.625
IS EITHER BECAUSE OF.

01:02:09.692 --> 01:02:11.594
PERSECUTION RELIGIOUS POLITICAL

01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:13.996
PERSECUTION OR BECAUSE OF

01:02:14.063 --> 01:02:15.531
EXTRAORDINARY ECONOMIC

01:02:15.598 --> 01:02:18.267
HARDSHIPS- AND WHAT IT TAKES TO

01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:19.368
BE ABLE TO LEAVE THEIR

01:02:19.435 --> 01:02:21.237
COUNTRIES WHETHER IT'S- ACROSS

01:02:21.304 --> 01:02:23.806
THE OCEAN OR- A FEW COUNTRIES

01:02:23.873 --> 01:02:26.275
AWAY- IS AN EXTRAORDINARY

01:02:26.342 --> 01:02:29.378
SACRIFICE AND IT'S RISK TAKING-

01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:31.447
I HAVE NEVER KNOWN OR TALKED TO

01:02:31.514 --> 01:02:32.849
ANYONE WHO SAID THAT THEY CAME

01:02:32.915 --> 01:02:36.085
HERE BECAUSE OF OUR- HEALTH. OF

01:02:36.152 --> 01:02:38.888
COVERAGE SO I HAVE. NO REASON

01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:40.590
TO THINK THAT THIS WOULD CAUSE

01:02:40.656 --> 01:02:42.258
ANYONE TO LEAVE THEIR

01:02:42.325 --> 01:02:46.329
COUNTRIES- BECAUSE OF THIS-

01:02:46.395 --> 01:02:48.264
CARING. THE OTHER THING IS.

01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:50.833
WE'RE PAYING. JUST WITH REGARD

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.301
TO THE OTHER QUESTION SENATOR

01:02:52.368 --> 01:02:54.804
ALL WE'RE PAYING RIGHT NOW FOR

01:02:54.871 --> 01:02:57.073
EMERGENCY CARE WERE REQUIRED TO

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:59.442
PROVIDE EMERGENCY CARE. THAT IS

01:02:59.509 --> 01:03:01.777
FAR MORE COSTLY THAN

01:03:01.844 --> 01:03:03.980
PREVENTATIVE CARE AND IT SEEMS

01:03:04.046 --> 01:03:06.249
TO ME THE SMARTEST WITH REGARDS

01:03:06.315 --> 01:03:11.154
TO- WITH REGARDS TO COST. IS

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:13.222
THAT WE- THAT WE DO IT IN THE

01:03:13.289 --> 01:03:16.926
FRONT- AS PREVENTING NOT AT THE

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:20.863
END WHEN IT'S ALREADY. A CRISIS

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:21.697
AND IT COSTS SO MUCH MORE.

01:03:21.764 --> 01:03:24.400
THANK I DO UNDERSTAND THAT

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:25.935
PEACE AND THAT'S EVIDENT WHY

01:03:26.002 --> 01:03:27.670
ALL THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:28.704
ARE ON THE SIDE OF THE BILL IN

01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:30.740
SUPPORT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WOULD

01:03:30.806 --> 01:03:32.108
REDUCE COSTS FOR EMERGENCY ROOM

01:03:32.175 --> 01:03:34.210
CARE- I DO UNDERSTAND THAT I

01:03:34.277 --> 01:03:35.945
JUST. I HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS

01:03:36.012 --> 01:03:38.047
ABOUT THE BENEFITS OFFERED TO

01:03:38.114 --> 01:03:38.881
AND DOCUMENT IT'S WHEN WE HAVE

01:03:38.948 --> 01:03:41.284
SO MANY US CITIZENS THAT ARE

01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:42.451
UNEMPLOYED THAT ARE TRYING TO

01:03:42.518 --> 01:03:44.053

WHILE SERVING IT'S- MORAL

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:13.482
IMPERATIVE FOR US TO ENSURE

01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:16.252
THAT ALL OF THE RESIDENTS OF

CALIFORNIA HAVE ACCESS TO- TO

HEALTH CARE- AND THE SENIORS

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:23.492
YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THEY'RE

01:04:23.559 --> 01:04:25.528

DON'T HAVE DOCUMENTS- AND I

01:04:47.149 --> 01:04:47.984
THINK WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT

THAT IS MORE EXPENSIVE FOR

01:04:57.293 --> 01:04:58.094
TAXPAYERS AND ACTUALLY

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:00.329
PROVIDING. PREVENTATIVE AND

EARLY INTERVENTION CARE- IT IS

01:05:03.699 --> 01:05:06.002
GOOD IDEA THE A PROGRESSIVE

01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:06.569
STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA WOULD

ALLOW. HI SENIORS TO LANGUISH

01:05:09.705 --> 01:05:10.906
WITHOUT HEALTH CARE IS

01:05:10.973 --> 01:05:13.175
UNCONSCIONABLE AND- WE NEED TO

01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:14.810
DO THIS I KNOW THERE'S A COSTS

01:05:14.877 --> 01:05:18.748

01:05:37.633 --> 01:05:40.336
NOTHING IS MUCH GREATER. THAN

01:05:40.403 --> 01:05:42.238
TRYING TO HELP THESE VULNERABLE

01:05:42.305 --> 01:05:45.241

ONLY WAY FOR A PROGRAM LIKE

PEOPLE YOU PLACE THEM WHERE THE

01:45:47.941 --> 01:45:49.576

REDUCE THEIR OPERATIONS.

02:32:25.836 --> 02:32:27.371
MEANWHILE PARTLY DUE TO THE

02:32:27.438 --> 02:32:29.306
SAME DECLINES IN PATIENT DEMAND

02:32:29.373 --> 02:32:30.074
THAT IF SO ADVERSELY AFFECTED

02:32:30.140 --> 02:32:32.276
THESE PRICES HEALTH INSURANCE

INCREASED COST OF PP COMBINED

02:32:43.721 --> 02:32:44.889
WITH THE DROP IN PATIENT VISITS

02:32:44.955 --> 02:32:46.223
COULD RESULT IN A WAVE OF

02:32:46.290 --> 02:32:48.259
CONSOLIDATION. THAT WOULD

02:32:48.325 --> 02:32:49.026
INCREASE HEALTHCARE EXPENSES

02:32:49.093 --> 02:32:51.095
AND DECREASE PATIENT ACCESS TO

02:32:54.598 --> 02:32:56.400
PHYSICIAN PRACTICES IT WILL

02:32:56.467 --> 02:32:58.068
FURTHER INTENSIFY THE STRESSES

MEETING THE HEALTHCARE NEEDS OF

PATIENTS EVEN HARDER I SHOULD

02:33:03.874 --> 02:33:04.909
ALSO NOTE THAT RURAL AND

02:33:04.975 --> 02:33:06.277
UNDERSERVED AREAS WOULD BE

02:33:06.343 --> 02:33:08.045
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. BY

02:33:08.112 --> 02:33:10.014
SUCH RESULTS. AS WE FIGHT TO

02:33:10.080 --> 02:33:11.782
ELIMINATE THE THREAT OF COVET

02:33:11.849 --> 02:33:12.516

MEDICAL CARE IN THE LONG TERM

02:33:20.124 --> 02:33:21.792
WE CAN'T LET THE ONE GOAL COME

02:33:21.859 --> 02:33:23.594
AT THE EXPENSE. OF THE OTHERS

02:33:23.661 --> 02:33:25.029
EVERYONE SHOULD BE CONTRIBUTING

THIS HEALTH EMERGENCIES- TO

02:56:29.545 --> 02:56:31.113
GENEROSA POINT WHICH IS A GOOD

02:56:31.180 --> 02:56:33.049

ENDING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY.

02:56:39.522 --> 02:56:40.856
HE GETS THE GOVERNMENT THAT THE

BECAUSE YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE.

02:56:52.468 --> 02:56:53.436
IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY IS
