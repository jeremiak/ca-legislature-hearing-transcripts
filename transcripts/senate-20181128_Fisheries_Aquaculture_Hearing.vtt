of the state portions of the

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.618
north coast remain close to

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:53.153
it due to elevated to mark

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.221
acid levels we're also going

environmental organizations

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:04.431
up and down the coast have

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:06.266
been making to avoid whale

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:07.534
entanglements during crab

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.035
season you're gonna hear

in just a bit George Jacobs

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:01.387
quick update on tomorrow gas

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:03.156
at levels -- we typically

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:04.858
have doctor Rafe could delay

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:06.960
here from UC Santa Cruz he's

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:09.062
-- ocean scientists providing

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:10.530
tomorrow gas of level updates

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:11.664
and today he's traveling

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:13.733
instances regrets the bottom

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.835
line through his update is

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:17.136
demo gas a doubles in the

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:18.972
Pacific this year have been

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:20.373
trending upwards particularly

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.342
in northern California -- we

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:23.710
were very concerned because in

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:26.513
the beginning of -- the fall

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.081
the trains were looking like

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:29.749
two thousand fifteen which was

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.918
the worst on record Humboldt

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.786
del nor and seven organ have

00:02:33.853 --> 00:02:36.022
emerge is hot spots along the

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.491
west coast however two thousand

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:39.959
eighteen appears to have peaked

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:42.161
in September and October and we

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:44.297
are now seen declining levels

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:45.865
of tomorrow gas it even in the

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:48.034
north by and we do not expect

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:48.902
and other state Y.

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:50.236
closure like we saw in the

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:51.871
disastrous crap year of two

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:54.908
thousand fifteen that said

00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:56.509
I think that almost all this

00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:58.444
can agree the Pacific go see

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:00.847
ocean is changing its sick

00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:02.115
and we have a new reality in

00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:04.217
front of us climate change is

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:07.186
no longer a theory it's here

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:08.888
in California's environment is

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:10.823
paying the price no matter how

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.492
many times are president says

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:14.794
climate change is a hoax it's

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.397
not going away our quality of

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:20.500
life our economy our health

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:21.868
in our environment will be

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:23.269
worse off because of climate

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:24.771
change and that's when the

00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:26.439
reasons why we are here today

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:27.874
how we're gonna work together

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:29.742
in the months to come to be

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:31.844
able to focus on digits crap

00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:33.379
ocean conditions as well as

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:34.881
protecting our majestic well

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:36.883
population at this point I'd

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.217
like to be able to turn the

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:40.053
floor over to our vice chair

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.821
by Sture stone I to be able

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.022
to offer opening comments and

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:44.057
we'll go to assembly member

00:03:44.123 --> 00:03:45.191
team Mister vice chair the

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:46.793
for sure Sir thank you Mister

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.461
chair welcome everyone to this

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:50.797
hearing it's very interesting

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:52.332
time in one of the things

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:53.299
the secure that I very much

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:54.100
appreciate this committee

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:56.169
is done is it's really but

00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:57.804
a bridge between a lot of

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.005
different stakeholders for some

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.473
very difficult issues as we

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.142
try and manage sustainable in

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.011
industries is simple fisheries

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.447
here in California ensure that

00:04:07.513 --> 00:04:09.215
iconic species like the Selmon

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:10.917
it's androgynous crabs and

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:13.553
others are very much a part

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.922
of our policy making and how

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.390
we understand interactions

00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:19.192
with the ocean we also have

00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:21.260
to recognize the changes in

00:04:21.327 --> 00:04:23.930
those oceans because of really

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:24.998
global changes that have

00:04:25.064 --> 00:04:27.734
happened and the California

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.235
led the way with the climate

00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:30.870
action so that just a couple

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.639
of months ago and what was very

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:35.074
interesting was California's

00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:36.509
position internationally

00:04:36.576 --> 00:04:37.677
with many many jurisdictions

00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:39.178
coming for putting a number

00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:41.114
of other states but countries

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.215
from around the world looking

00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:43.416
for leadership out out of

00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:46.152
California and the conversation

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:47.253
about what we do with some

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.521
of the changes that we are

00:04:48.588 --> 00:04:50.256
saying so the first couple

00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:51.791
presenters we have from Los

00:04:51.858 --> 00:04:53.760
protection council and from

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:56.362
fish and wildlife show some

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:57.797
of the bridges and connections

00:04:57.864 --> 00:04:59.132
that we need to maintain

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:00.767
and as we head into a new

00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:02.602
administration I think this

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.170
committee can be very important

00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:05.872
in in helping to continue to

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:07.540
provide those bridges between

00:05:07.607 --> 00:05:08.908
all of the stakeholders as

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:10.376
we deal with issues around

00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:12.745
the crap fisheries impacts

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:13.880
on other wildlife that we

00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:15.648
want to protect but also

00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:17.617
understanding ways that we

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:19.686
can look at broader policy

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:20.620
to ensure that the oceans

00:05:20.687 --> 00:05:22.388
are healthy is that's a part

00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:24.123
of sustainable fisheries as

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.192
well I've had the opportunity

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.327
over this last year to go

00:05:28.394 --> 00:05:29.796
to a number of meetings and

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:31.431
conferences one most recently

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:34.100
at at the muscle any marine

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:35.668
lab which is the CSU's marine

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:38.271
lab on aquaculture and tied

00:05:38.337 --> 00:05:39.639
into all of this and tied into

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:41.741
the sustainable fisheries is

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:44.343
California's position or lack

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.679
of position with aquaculture

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:47.647
and I think that's something

00:05:47.714 --> 00:05:48.748
that this committee is also

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:49.716
very interested in looking at

00:05:49.782 --> 00:05:50.950
I know she protection councils

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:53.086
of added as are the the

00:05:53.152 --> 00:05:54.620
departments and I'm hoping that

00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:56.189
over the next few weeks engage

00:05:56.255 --> 00:05:57.724
with the administration look

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.659
at barriers to the challenges

00:05:59.726 --> 00:06:01.260
to the aquaculture industry

00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:03.830
in a productive way so that

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:06.199
we can can look at Especiales

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:09.502
shellfish and some of the the

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:10.870
at the algae sea weeds that

00:06:10.937 --> 00:06:13.005
are currently being produced in

00:06:13.072 --> 00:06:14.407
California but in fairly small

00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:15.475
numbers that I think that there

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:16.409
are ways that we can bridge

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:17.543
that but without the science

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.678
behind the changes that are

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:20.680
going on without understanding

00:06:20.747 --> 00:06:22.448
of the breadth of the issues

00:06:22.515 --> 00:06:24.584
around fisheries then we're

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.952
always going to be coming up I

00:06:26.018 --> 00:06:27.053
think a little bit short from

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.354
a policy standpoint and that's

00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:29.822
why I think this committee and

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:30.790
then we really should Mister

00:06:30.857 --> 00:06:32.825
chair can be a very good

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:34.260
focal point for a lot of these

00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:35.661
discussions whether it's well

00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:37.330
entanglements whether it's

00:06:37.396 --> 00:06:39.699
looking at ocean acidification

00:06:39.766 --> 00:06:41.400
and changes in chemistry that

00:06:41.467 --> 00:06:43.569
fact tensely seafood industries

00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:44.971
we can have conversations about

00:06:45.037 --> 00:06:46.439
the regulatory environment

00:06:46.506 --> 00:06:47.940
and working with regulating

00:06:48.007 --> 00:06:49.408
agencies so that they can

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:50.877
fulfill their mission we can

00:06:50.943 --> 00:06:52.011
protect the environment we

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:53.045
can protect the state state

00:06:53.112 --> 00:06:55.248
ability of fisheries but also

00:06:55.314 --> 00:06:57.316
ensure the economic viability

00:06:57.383 --> 00:06:58.684
of some of these pieces that

00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:00.486
are very report to California

00:07:00.553 --> 00:07:02.355
and to California's economy

00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:03.556
so this is this is going to

00:07:03.623 --> 00:07:04.891
be very interesting hearing

00:07:04.957 --> 00:07:06.425

-- but that development off

00:07:36.489 --> 00:07:37.456

two hundred million dollar

00:10:10.242 --> 00:10:13.312
project would look like -- we

00:10:13.379 --> 00:10:14.914
are fortunate to have with us

00:10:14.981 --> 00:10:17.316

of a very detailed version

00:10:20.052 --> 00:10:26.092
of this -- this project

00:10:26.158 --> 00:10:27.994
-- we are an amalgam of six

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.829
branches so agreement bay

00:10:29.895 --> 00:10:31.597
is only one of them we run

00:10:31.664 --> 00:10:32.631
the eco center part for the

00:10:32.698 --> 00:10:35.334
port -- in a database and the

00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:37.103
bay academy the Bates to it

00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:38.938
on the bay model for the US

00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:39.972
army corps of engineers in

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:42.808
Sausalito and -- also see line

00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:43.876
center which is on the other

00:10:43.943 --> 00:10:49.081
side of the act that the docks

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:50.316
those are some of a lease

00:10:50.383 --> 00:10:51.283
properties of corporate

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:52.485
offices across the street

00:10:52.551 --> 00:10:53.586
be employed one hundred and

00:10:53.652 --> 00:10:55.221
seventy five people and over

00:10:55.287 --> 00:10:57.490
three hundred volunteers the

00:10:57.556 --> 00:10:58.858
welcome about seventy thousand

00:10:58.924 --> 00:11:00.326
visitors each year this year

00:11:00.393 --> 00:11:02.061
the two as number seven down

00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:03.696
but with this new climate and

00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:05.131
motion conservation museum

00:11:05.197 --> 00:11:07.066
we are hoping to attract

00:11:07.133 --> 00:11:08.300
to two million visitors a

00:11:08.367 --> 00:11:10.669
year -- there are fifteen

00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:11.737
million visitors a complete

00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:13.506
the Embarcadero each year so

00:11:13.572 --> 00:11:14.874
by comparison told me income

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.242
to the Golden Gate Bridge

00:11:16.308 --> 00:11:17.309
in fifty million come to the

00:11:17.376 --> 00:11:19.178
Embarcadero so we thought that

00:11:19.245 --> 00:11:20.379
if we can tap into five or

00:11:20.446 --> 00:11:22.548
ten percent of that number --

00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:25.051
we will have an evangelized

00:11:25.117 --> 00:11:27.086
climate literacy and resilience

00:11:27.153 --> 00:11:39.331
at leadership for tomorrow

00:11:39.398 --> 00:11:41.000
so you get a sense of the

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:42.668
scope and scale of the project

00:11:42.735 --> 00:11:43.803
-- people working with an

00:11:43.869 --> 00:11:45.004

for the last eighteen months

00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:48.641
-- in about eight thousand

00:11:48.707 --> 00:11:50.509
hours of work into this --

00:11:50.576 --> 00:11:51.577
edifice and its C.

00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:53.779
early platinum building --

00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:55.448
which has photo by reactors

00:11:55.514 --> 00:11:57.650
uses when power it is --

00:11:57.716 --> 00:11:58.717
powered by Michael brick

00:11:58.784 --> 00:12:00.719
using fish waste and it has

00:12:00.786 --> 00:12:02.021
a lot of nuances in all the

00:12:02.088 --> 00:12:03.823
topics that Mr waste your

rise sequel Michael plastics

00:12:11.163 --> 00:12:12.965

00:12:13.966 --> 00:12:15.434
conversation including

00:12:15.501 --> 00:12:20.139
celebrating climate heroes

00:12:20.206 --> 00:12:21.173
it gives you a visual

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.141
on what the Senate would

00:12:22.208 --> 00:12:23.442
look like hundred sixty

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:24.743
thousand square feet with

00:13:30.843 --> 00:13:32.444
first panel now we're gonna

00:13:32.511 --> 00:13:34.380
have remarks from a bill that

00:13:34.446 --> 00:13:36.148
would never have percent cheese

00:13:36.215 --> 00:13:37.583
the ocean protective council

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.018
executive director also the

00:13:39.084 --> 00:13:41.220
deputy secretary for oceans

00:13:41.287 --> 00:13:42.721
of coastal policy into the

00:13:42.788 --> 00:13:43.989
California natural resources

00:13:44.056 --> 00:13:45.758
agency we're also hearing

00:13:45.824 --> 00:13:47.226
from Mister Chuck Bonta music

00:13:47.293 --> 00:13:48.093
director of the California

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.862
department of fish wildlife

00:13:49.929 --> 00:13:51.363
-- please view to wouldn't

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.232
mind coming forward on this

00:13:53.299 --> 00:13:54.466
however status can be focusing

00:13:54.533 --> 00:13:57.203
a report on ocean acidification

00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:59.271
as well as efforts on Whalen

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:00.906
turtle entanglement and their

00:14:00.973 --> 00:14:02.608
support of the well working

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:03.976
group in the dungeon it's crap

00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:05.945
task is the director is going

00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:07.546
to be focusing his comments

00:14:07.613 --> 00:14:10.049
on the monumental efforts that

00:14:10.115 --> 00:14:11.083
the city California's been

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.252
advancing a in regards to well

00:14:13.319 --> 00:14:14.954
entanglement and the launch of

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.622
a first ago first of its kind

00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:17.523
program here in the United

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.225
States of America out working

00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:21.694
with the federal government

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.728
this have reset the floors

00:14:22.795 --> 00:14:23.896
yours thank you so much you

00:14:23.963 --> 00:14:25.030
have seven minutes and we are

00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:26.432
so grateful for all the work or

00:14:26.498 --> 00:14:27.967
happy you're here with us today

00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:29.468
thank you very much chairman

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:31.604
and thank you assemblyman stone

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:32.671
and assemblyman saying it's

00:14:32.738 --> 00:14:34.440
a pleasure to be here today

00:14:34.506 --> 00:14:35.641
-- again I'm the executive

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:36.642
director of the California

00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:37.843
mission protection counsel

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:39.511
and deputy secretary friction

00:14:39.578 --> 00:14:41.447
coastal matters resources

00:14:41.513 --> 00:14:43.649
agency which is a mouthful

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:46.151
and but at our mission really

00:14:46.218 --> 00:14:47.620
is to protect and conserve

00:14:47.686 --> 00:14:49.355
the ocean and you mentioned a

00:14:49.421 --> 00:14:51.490
couple of threats that and that

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:52.524
the ocean is facing right now

00:14:52.591 --> 00:14:54.193
one is entanglement which I'll

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.594
discuss a bit and the other

00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:56.795
is climate change which just

00:14:56.862 --> 00:14:58.230
infuses all of the work that

00:14:58.297 --> 00:15:01.100
we do and affects the ocean so

00:15:01.166 --> 00:15:03.335
significantly and in relation

00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:06.538
to Wayland payment OPC since

00:15:06.605 --> 00:15:08.440
September twenty fifteen has

00:15:08.507 --> 00:15:10.576
been working to identify and

00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:12.111
to reduce the risks and Waylon

00:15:12.177 --> 00:15:14.480
team woman and in dungeons

00:15:14.546 --> 00:15:16.682
crab fishing year we work very

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:18.317
closely with city of W.

00:15:18.384 --> 00:15:21.220
with no way to convene and a

00:15:21.287 --> 00:15:23.155
really unique and effective

00:15:23.222 --> 00:15:24.957
collaboration and fishermen

00:15:25.024 --> 00:15:27.726
NGOs and federal and state

00:15:27.793 --> 00:15:29.828
partners -- in order to you

00:15:29.895 --> 00:15:32.731
think three to and how to best

00:15:32.798 --> 00:15:34.500
address and reduce the risk of

00:15:34.566 --> 00:15:36.235
will entertainment specifically

00:15:36.302 --> 00:15:38.103
intention is practicing here

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.405
and we provided a grant to

00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:40.773
the nature Conservancy to

00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:42.341
administer facilitate this

00:15:42.408 --> 00:15:44.009
group which I'm going to call

00:15:44.076 --> 00:15:45.644
the the whale entanglement

00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:46.745
working group it's also known

00:15:46.812 --> 00:15:47.579
as the tension is kind of

00:15:47.646 --> 00:15:49.148
fishing gear working group that

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:50.349
that gets confusing because

00:15:50.416 --> 00:15:51.784
there's also Dennis got task

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:53.552
force and so I will stick with

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:54.553
just calling it a will working

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.221
group so the will working

00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:57.890
group the last couple of years

00:15:57.956 --> 00:15:59.158
has worked on developing a

00:15:59.224 --> 00:16:00.626
risk assessment in mitigation

00:16:00.693 --> 00:16:03.262
program and to determine where

00:16:03.329 --> 00:16:04.663
it when the risk containment

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.665
is elevated and to identify

00:16:06.732 --> 00:16:08.167
measures to reduce that risk

00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:09.968
it's called the ramp and the

00:16:10.035 --> 00:16:12.071
ramp was highlighted -- in

00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:14.139
the last couple of seasons and

00:16:14.206 --> 00:16:15.741
under Senate bill thirteen oh

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:18.510
nine by senator required and

00:16:18.577 --> 00:16:20.979
it was codified and the working

00:16:21.046 --> 00:16:22.414
group it's also codified

00:16:22.481 --> 00:16:25.084
legislatively and and director

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:26.352
Bonham was given the authority

00:16:26.418 --> 00:16:27.653
to implement management

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.588
measures and in the event

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:32.091
of elevated risk so the real

00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:33.826
really represents an innovative

00:16:33.892 --> 00:16:35.728
effective partnership that's

00:16:35.794 --> 00:16:37.763
based on approach to develop

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:39.732
solutions to decrease

00:16:39.798 --> 00:16:42.735
the risk of entanglement

00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:45.037
in concert with that program

00:16:45.104 --> 00:16:47.206
OPC also receive seven point

00:16:47.272 --> 00:16:48.841
five million dollars this year

00:16:48.907 --> 00:16:51.343
in the budget and assembly

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:53.312
member take a to address the

00:16:53.379 --> 00:16:55.247
way on sea turtle entanglement

00:16:55.314 --> 00:16:56.782
and and we have been working

00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:57.850
with the way on the woman

00:16:57.916 --> 00:17:00.252
working group to identify

00:17:00.319 --> 00:17:01.787
appropriate projects that

00:17:01.854 --> 00:17:03.622
will help reduce that risk

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:07.793
and and and separate out the

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.629
the crab fishing if you're

00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:12.531
having a thriving crab fishery

00:17:12.598 --> 00:17:14.099
and having a very thriving

00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:15.834
we'll completion were really

00:17:15.901 --> 00:17:17.736
relying on the ramp program

00:17:17.803 --> 00:17:20.272
to identify those projects

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:22.107
that that we need to implement

00:17:22.174 --> 00:17:23.909
and we have both short term

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:25.310
high priority projects that

00:17:25.377 --> 00:17:27.045
were identifying as well as

00:17:27.112 --> 00:17:28.380
I'm developing a lot more

00:17:28.447 --> 00:17:30.349
long term holistic investment

00:17:30.416 --> 00:17:33.619
strategy and to the budget

00:17:33.685 --> 00:17:35.888
was at became effective July

00:17:35.954 --> 00:17:37.689
one we've already implemented

00:17:37.756 --> 00:17:41.260
to projects and one was at

00:17:41.326 --> 00:17:42.494
a grant to the California

00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:44.496
will rescue to support and

00:17:44.563 --> 00:17:45.964
I fishing dynamics and well

00:17:46.031 --> 00:17:49.034
concentration data collection

00:17:49.101 --> 00:17:51.003
and program through the use of

00:17:51.069 --> 00:17:53.205
solar lawmakers Anne's solar

00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:54.506
loggers are being deployed

00:17:54.573 --> 00:17:56.608
on forty commercial fishing

00:17:56.675 --> 00:17:57.976
vessels as well as twenty

00:17:58.043 --> 00:17:59.411
well watching and passenger

00:17:59.478 --> 00:18:01.180
vessels any idea there is to

00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:03.382
be able to collect data from

00:18:03.449 --> 00:18:04.450
both the fishermen who are

00:18:04.516 --> 00:18:07.719
out and doing their work and

00:18:07.786 --> 00:18:09.755
from the wheel watchers you

00:18:09.822 --> 00:18:11.223
least theoretically identifying

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.858
where the well populations are

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:14.560
and then bringing that data

00:18:14.626 --> 00:18:16.528
together performing analytics

00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:18.530
on it performing visualization

00:18:18.597 --> 00:18:20.499
and developing things like maps

00:18:20.566 --> 00:18:23.101
so that we can really see very

00:18:23.168 --> 00:18:24.837
clearly where the crap where

00:18:24.903 --> 00:18:26.338
the wheels and and think about

00:18:26.405 --> 00:18:28.340
ways to avoid entanglement

00:18:28.407 --> 00:18:30.709
and interaction the other

00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:31.910
grant that we provided was a

00:18:31.977 --> 00:18:33.412
million dollars to the wildlife

00:18:33.479 --> 00:18:34.847
health center at let's run

00:18:34.913 --> 00:18:36.849
through UC Davis I'm in that

00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:38.183
supports the California marine

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.352
mammal stranding network and

00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:42.287
for stealing and seal rescue

00:18:42.354 --> 00:18:44.790
that was and actually -- --

00:18:44.857 --> 00:18:46.225
specific appropriation as

00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:47.359
part of the seven point five

00:18:47.426 --> 00:18:49.928
million and and we've we've

00:18:49.995 --> 00:18:52.431
already provided that you the

00:18:52.498 --> 00:18:54.099
wildlife health center in order

00:18:54.166 --> 00:18:57.803
to address and remain standing

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:59.304
in addition to the well working

00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:00.272
group we wouldn't working

00:19:00.339 --> 00:19:01.640
very closely with and then

00:19:01.707 --> 00:19:03.442
attention is caught task force

00:19:03.509 --> 00:19:04.843
and in since two thousand

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.645
eight actually a PC has been

00:19:06.712 --> 00:19:08.113
designated as the body that's

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.882
responsible for convening

00:19:09.948 --> 00:19:12.551
this task force and under

00:19:12.618 --> 00:19:13.952
another piece of legislation

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:15.721
by senator required and we

00:19:15.787 --> 00:19:16.889
will be able to continue

00:19:16.955 --> 00:19:18.991
administering the task force in

00:19:19.057 --> 00:19:21.360
partnership with city of W.

00:19:21.426 --> 00:19:22.761
and and it is a separate

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:25.197
administrative team and

00:19:25.264 --> 00:19:26.465
part of that legislation

00:19:26.532 --> 00:19:29.101
SB thirteen ten update the

00:19:29.167 --> 00:19:30.402
tension is packed task force

00:19:30.469 --> 00:19:32.471
election process -- and so

00:19:32.538 --> 00:19:33.572
we are working again very

00:19:33.639 --> 00:19:35.340
closely with city of W.

00:19:35.407 --> 00:19:37.242
downline a process and the

00:19:37.309 --> 00:19:38.810
timing for the next election

00:19:38.877 --> 00:19:39.945
because there's some changes

00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:41.179
in the composition of the

00:19:41.246 --> 00:19:42.881
task force I do you just want

00:19:42.948 --> 00:19:45.517
to note -- that as a world

00:19:45.584 --> 00:19:46.785
where there's going to be a

00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:48.287
new administration starting

00:19:48.353 --> 00:19:50.122
in January so for the members

00:19:50.188 --> 00:19:51.456
of the task force that are

00:19:51.523 --> 00:19:53.492
appointed by the chair and

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:55.594
the ocean protection council

00:19:55.661 --> 00:19:56.728
with the secretary of natural

00:19:56.795 --> 00:19:58.697
resources there will be a

00:19:58.764 --> 00:19:59.965
delay you know and so we

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:03.602
have a new secretary in place

00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:05.504
turning now to our work on

00:20:05.571 --> 00:20:06.838
commission acidification

00:20:06.905 --> 00:20:09.041
and more the climate change

00:20:09.107 --> 00:20:11.376
threats and that that proposed

00:20:11.443 --> 00:20:12.811
to the ocean the wildlife

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:15.714
and fisheries and the OPC

00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:18.250
adopted in October and ocean

00:20:18.317 --> 00:20:20.285
acidification action plan

00:20:20.352 --> 00:20:22.287
and this is a ten year action

00:20:22.354 --> 00:20:24.790
plan and and it fulfills

00:20:24.856 --> 00:20:25.991
one of our commitments as a

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:27.326
founding member of the ocean

00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:30.429
acidification alliance and and

00:20:30.495 --> 00:20:34.032
access acts as a model we hope

00:20:34.099 --> 00:20:37.202
for an for other jurisdictions

00:20:37.269 --> 00:20:38.570
who are who are members have

00:20:38.637 --> 00:20:40.305
this alliance the idea is

00:20:40.372 --> 00:20:43.275
to have tractable actionable

00:20:43.342 --> 00:20:45.043
steps that can be taken over

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:47.012
the next ten years to mitigate

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:49.214
ameliorate the realities of

00:20:49.281 --> 00:20:52.117
ocean acidification and we

00:20:52.184 --> 00:20:53.819
first became aware of ocean

00:20:53.885 --> 00:20:56.221
acidification from the the

00:20:56.288 --> 00:20:58.090
harm that was being faced by

00:20:58.156 --> 00:20:59.391
Washington state when they're

00:20:59.458 --> 00:21:00.926
western countries and their

00:21:00.993 --> 00:21:03.595
oyster industry collapsed and

00:21:03.662 --> 00:21:04.896
and we've been working closely

00:21:04.963 --> 00:21:06.965
with Washington Oregon British

00:21:07.032 --> 00:21:09.301
Columbia and now seventy eye

00:21:09.368 --> 00:21:13.672
there at international the

00:21:13.739 --> 00:21:15.641
jurisdictions to address ocean

00:21:15.707 --> 00:21:17.609
acidification I I do want

00:21:17.676 --> 00:21:19.044
to just point out that the

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:21.046
science right now is indicating

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:22.781
that the harm is not limited

00:21:22.848 --> 00:21:24.950
to mollusks is not limited

00:21:25.017 --> 00:21:27.519
to oysters there is and the

00:21:27.586 --> 00:21:29.655
potential for it in implicate

00:21:29.721 --> 00:21:33.025
crab reduplicated salmon and

00:21:33.091 --> 00:21:34.559
so the time this is really a

00:21:34.626 --> 00:21:36.361
critical moment when we need

00:21:36.428 --> 00:21:37.696
to be focused on an ocean

00:21:37.763 --> 00:21:39.231
acidification and how we are

00:21:39.297 --> 00:21:42.000
going to and mitigate those

00:21:42.067 --> 00:21:43.101
impacts and so that's what

00:21:43.168 --> 00:21:45.704
this plan does and we're now

00:21:45.771 --> 00:21:46.905
that it's past we're working

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:48.807
already in implementing and

00:21:48.874 --> 00:21:52.544
the various steps included in

00:21:52.611 --> 00:21:53.812
and finally I just wanted to

00:21:53.879 --> 00:21:56.148
note that down the street today

00:21:56.214 --> 00:21:58.884
and California's track of fish

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:01.353
two point oh kick dot and that

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.988
is a really exciting anything

00:22:03.055 --> 00:22:05.190
innovative partnerships

00:22:05.257 --> 00:22:07.025
and it's a global program

00:22:07.092 --> 00:22:09.127
that incubates pioneering

00:22:09.194 --> 00:22:11.463
sustainable seafood businesses

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:12.497
and brings them together

00:22:12.564 --> 00:22:14.099
brings together investors

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:16.068
seafood entrepreneurs fishermen

00:22:16.134 --> 00:22:18.370
public agencies NGOs to really

00:22:18.437 --> 00:22:19.838
think through innovative

00:22:19.905 --> 00:22:22.641
new approaches to developing

00:22:22.708 --> 00:22:24.009
sustainable seafood and

00:22:24.076 --> 00:22:25.977
sustainable fishing programs

00:22:26.044 --> 00:22:27.345
and California and a P.

00:22:27.412 --> 00:22:29.748
C. supported this track and

00:22:29.815 --> 00:22:31.149
it has three main goals one

00:22:31.216 --> 00:22:33.518
is to -- address traceability

00:22:33.585 --> 00:22:36.088
and transparency one is to

00:22:36.154 --> 00:22:38.090
and develop innovations in

00:22:38.156 --> 00:22:41.059
sustainable local food systems

00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:42.594
and the fishing communities

00:22:42.661 --> 00:22:43.695
and the third is to increase

00:22:43.762 --> 00:22:45.430
resilience to climate change

00:22:45.497 --> 00:22:46.565
I'm so we're really excited

00:22:46.631 --> 00:22:48.133
to see that moving forward and

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.168
and there will be a competition

00:22:50.235 --> 00:22:51.169
and winners will be announced

00:22:51.236 --> 00:22:53.472
tomorrow so I with that I and

00:22:53.538 --> 00:22:55.340
I turn it over to director on

00:22:55.407 --> 00:22:56.274
thank you so much and Weber

sea disasters that we faced

00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:12.924
as well as on land with all

00:23:12.991 --> 00:23:14.760

director of the California

00:23:46.558 --> 00:23:49.628
department of fish and wildlife

00:23:49.694 --> 00:23:50.929
just by way of forecast

00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:52.230
later today you'll hear from

department he will have all

00:23:55.167 --> 00:23:57.969
the specific details around

00:23:58.036 --> 00:23:59.304
the general Dungeness crab

00:23:59.371 --> 00:24:01.406
season outlook the disaster

00:24:01.473 --> 00:24:03.975
relief process quality testing

00:24:04.042 --> 00:24:07.212
-- mark as a testing and then

from some key monster that

00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:12.017
the department who will walk

00:24:12.083 --> 00:24:14.085
you through the operational

00:24:14.152 --> 00:24:16.087
details of the risk assessment

00:24:16.154 --> 00:24:18.123
mitigation program that is

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:20.592
right secretary announced

00:24:20.659 --> 00:24:23.261
in my time I want to step

00:24:23.328 --> 00:24:25.263
back I want to offer a few

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:27.933
reflections -- based on almost

00:24:27.999 --> 00:24:30.869
the eight years as director and

00:24:30.936 --> 00:24:32.671
charter vision which I think

00:24:32.737 --> 00:24:34.372
you share with our department

00:24:34.439 --> 00:24:37.008
and everyone in the room and

00:24:37.075 --> 00:24:38.009
also when I try to make a

00:24:38.076 --> 00:24:41.479
little bit lives so crowds

00:24:41.546 --> 00:24:43.815
are big deal in California

00:24:43.882 --> 00:24:45.050
they're one of our oldest and

00:24:45.116 --> 00:24:47.485
most valuable fisheries and

00:24:47.552 --> 00:24:49.154
I don't know about where I

00:24:49.221 --> 00:24:50.388
grew up the floor of the all

00:24:50.455 --> 00:24:52.457
is all you all what all you

00:24:52.524 --> 00:24:54.092
all have on your holiday menus

00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:55.660
at home but I have Dodge's

00:24:55.727 --> 00:24:58.897
problem and then you come

00:24:58.964 --> 00:25:01.299
the crabs also supplied jobs to

00:25:01.366 --> 00:25:02.868
our coastal communities up and

00:25:02.934 --> 00:25:05.837
down the state but it's equally

00:25:05.904 --> 00:25:07.272
true whales are really big

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:09.908
deal I mean literally there the

00:25:09.975 --> 00:25:11.843
most majestic largest animal

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:14.145
swimming off of our Richard

00:25:14.212 --> 00:25:16.815
sure and I would say that what

00:25:16.882 --> 00:25:18.316
our department has done with

00:25:18.383 --> 00:25:21.319
a very broad set of partners

00:25:21.386 --> 00:25:22.787
to prevent well entanglement

00:25:22.854 --> 00:25:23.955
in fishing gear in the last

00:25:24.022 --> 00:25:27.759
couple years is a big deal also

00:25:27.826 --> 00:25:29.728
this state California's home

00:25:29.794 --> 00:25:31.396
to more biodiversity than

00:25:31.463 --> 00:25:33.064
any other state in these

00:25:33.131 --> 00:25:35.300
United States biodiversity

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:36.601
is a measure of the richness

00:25:36.668 --> 00:25:39.537
of life our ocean waters

00:25:39.604 --> 00:25:40.605
are home to one of the most

00:25:40.672 --> 00:25:42.440
productive marine ecosystems

00:25:42.507 --> 00:25:44.910
in the world and California's

00:25:44.976 --> 00:25:47.579
consistently rank very high

00:25:47.646 --> 00:25:50.181
protection of our ocean

00:25:50.248 --> 00:25:52.117
but in two thousand fifteen

00:25:52.183 --> 00:25:53.385
something happened that was

00:25:53.451 --> 00:25:55.287
pretty disturbing to everyone

00:25:55.353 --> 00:25:57.689
in this room we saw rising

00:25:57.756 --> 00:25:59.925
wait a rate of Wales entangled

00:25:59.991 --> 00:26:03.061
in fishing gear the number

00:26:03.128 --> 00:26:04.763
of reported entanglements

00:26:04.829 --> 00:26:06.498
jumped in two thousand fifteen

00:26:06.564 --> 00:26:09.200
and two thousand sixteen

00:26:09.267 --> 00:26:11.036
but dropped considerably in

00:26:11.102 --> 00:26:12.304
two thousand seventeen in

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:14.539
two thousand eight and that

00:26:14.606 --> 00:26:16.007
dropped by some accounts was

00:26:16.074 --> 00:26:19.311
as much as by eighty percent

00:26:19.377 --> 00:26:20.545
but the spike in two

00:26:20.612 --> 00:26:22.380
thousand fifteen and sixteen

00:26:22.447 --> 00:26:24.416
corresponded with things we've

00:26:24.482 --> 00:26:27.052
never seen in the ocean it

00:26:27.118 --> 00:26:29.054
corresponded with a change

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.290
in ocean temperature then

00:26:32.357 --> 00:26:35.560
tagged as the warm water

00:26:35.627 --> 00:26:37.762
and we saw a corresponding

00:26:37.829 --> 00:26:39.264
change in the abundance and

00:26:39.331 --> 00:26:40.999
location of the food that

00:26:41.066 --> 00:26:43.435
whales which is krill and

00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:46.471
small fish so because it is

00:26:46.538 --> 00:26:49.207
Ocean change the whales chase

00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:51.943
their food closer to shore

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:53.244
and that brought them into

00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:55.814
traditional fishing grounds

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.315
in in those fishing grounds in

00:26:57.382 --> 00:26:59.184
those years was an unusually

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:01.720
high concentration of year

00:27:01.786 --> 00:27:03.822
for crabbing because we had

00:27:03.888 --> 00:27:05.590
an unprecedented delay in

00:27:05.657 --> 00:27:08.126
the season from incredibly

00:27:08.193 --> 00:27:09.361
high levels of the mall the

00:27:09.427 --> 00:27:12.163
gas in in some since we had

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:14.032
an unholy convergence of

00:27:14.099 --> 00:27:16.267
these several factors any

00:27:16.334 --> 00:27:18.003
corresponded to that dramatic

00:27:18.069 --> 00:27:21.106
uptick in entanglements we

00:27:21.172 --> 00:27:22.073
were all concerned about

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:25.377
it even one whale or turtle

00:27:25.443 --> 00:27:28.380
entanglement is too many and

00:27:28.446 --> 00:27:29.714
that's why the department

00:27:29.781 --> 00:27:31.049
and our partners took swift

00:27:31.116 --> 00:27:33.618
action in two thousand fifteen

00:27:33.685 --> 00:27:34.386
as you've heard mention

00:27:34.452 --> 00:27:35.720
by the deputy secretary we

00:27:35.787 --> 00:27:39.357
establish this working with

00:27:39.424 --> 00:27:40.992
my next point is membership

00:27:41.059 --> 00:27:43.395
is really key to me it should

00:27:43.461 --> 00:27:45.730
be key to you as well in

00:27:45.797 --> 00:27:47.766
membership drives our future

00:27:47.832 --> 00:27:49.200
here's what I mean this

00:27:49.267 --> 00:27:50.802
working group is comprised of

00:27:50.869 --> 00:27:52.504
commercial and recreational

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:55.206
fishermen in one it includes

00:27:55.273 --> 00:27:56.574
environmental organizations

00:27:56.641 --> 00:27:57.642
some of whom you'll hear from

00:27:57.709 --> 00:28:00.178
today it includes members of

00:28:00.245 --> 00:28:03.081
the disentangle my network it

00:28:03.148 --> 00:28:04.883
includes marine mammal experts

00:28:04.949 --> 00:28:07.052
and resource managers we formed

00:28:07.118 --> 00:28:08.753
in two thousand fifteen and

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.289
they adopted one unifying

00:28:11.356 --> 00:28:12.690
principle they were gonna

00:28:12.757 --> 00:28:14.759
support both a robust Dungeness

00:28:14.826 --> 00:28:17.762
crab fishery in reduce well

00:28:17.829 --> 00:28:21.633
into mutually exclusive

00:28:21.699 --> 00:28:23.201
because of their work our

00:28:23.268 --> 00:28:25.070
department has at a platform

00:28:25.136 --> 00:28:27.138
to take specific action so here

00:28:27.205 --> 00:28:28.073
are some of the things we've

00:28:28.139 --> 00:28:30.909
done in the last two years

00:28:30.975 --> 00:28:32.710
we have informed all crabbers

00:28:32.777 --> 00:28:34.145
that everybody must check

00:28:34.212 --> 00:28:36.047
their gear every ninety six

00:28:36.114 --> 00:28:38.716
hours during the season we've

00:28:38.783 --> 00:28:40.385
created a program to retrieve

00:28:40.452 --> 00:28:41.753
derelict fishing gear from the

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.222
ocean which senator you sparked

00:28:44.289 --> 00:28:45.256
-- with your leadership in

00:28:45.323 --> 00:28:47.959
legislation we've collaborated

00:28:48.026 --> 00:28:49.360
with industry to develop will

00:28:49.427 --> 00:28:52.330
friendly year we've actually

00:28:52.397 --> 00:28:54.432
adopted new rules and got them

00:28:54.499 --> 00:28:56.000
in place before the season

00:28:56.067 --> 00:28:58.470
began limiting the number of

00:28:58.536 --> 00:28:59.871
trailer bill is in a link to

00:28:59.938 --> 00:29:02.640
fishing line that can be used

00:29:02.707 --> 00:29:04.509
and with clarified through

00:29:04.576 --> 00:29:05.743
the voice of our wildlife

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:08.680
officers that everyone must

00:29:08.746 --> 00:29:09.981
remove their fishing gear at

00:29:10.048 --> 00:29:11.516
the end of the crab season and

00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:15.220
we're going to enforce that

00:29:15.286 --> 00:29:17.055
since we're in San Francisco

00:29:17.122 --> 00:29:19.090
I'd be remiss if I didn't say

00:29:19.157 --> 00:29:21.159
tech can happen can help to

00:29:21.226 --> 00:29:23.461
hear you heard a description

00:29:23.528 --> 00:29:24.562
of some of the technology

00:29:24.629 --> 00:29:26.397
that's been invested in with

00:29:26.464 --> 00:29:27.765
seed funding by the protection

00:29:27.832 --> 00:29:30.135
council but the point here

00:29:30.201 --> 00:29:33.037
is we can do better we can

00:29:33.104 --> 00:29:34.772
get more immediate transfer

00:29:34.839 --> 00:29:36.341
of water observations in

00:29:36.407 --> 00:29:37.675
ocean conditions both from

00:29:37.742 --> 00:29:39.944
our beliefs and our will

00:29:40.011 --> 00:29:42.514
watching vessels we can force

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.582
that information into better

00:29:44.649 --> 00:29:47.252
analytical platforms give

00:29:47.318 --> 00:29:48.586
the information to those

00:29:48.653 --> 00:29:49.988
in the working group we can

00:29:50.054 --> 00:29:52.357
make instantaneous decisions

00:29:52.423 --> 00:29:53.825
to try to manage this risk

00:29:53.892 --> 00:29:55.860
profile technology can help

00:29:55.927 --> 00:29:57.996
here will and were marching

00:29:58.062 --> 00:30:00.431
along that path but I would

00:30:00.498 --> 00:30:02.834
argue the single most important

00:30:02.901 --> 00:30:05.236
change comes from senator

00:30:05.303 --> 00:30:06.871
your legislation SB thirty

00:30:06.938 --> 00:30:09.440
no not most people don't

00:30:09.507 --> 00:30:12.043
realize our crowd fisheries

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:14.746
primarily governed by the laws

00:30:14.812 --> 00:30:16.714
established in the legislative

00:30:16.781 --> 00:30:21.386
process the department then and

00:30:21.452 --> 00:30:23.087
previous to this bill we had

00:30:23.154 --> 00:30:25.890
no authority to take certain

00:30:25.957 --> 00:30:29.360
actions we now do we now

00:30:29.427 --> 00:30:31.196
have the specific legislative

00:30:31.262 --> 00:30:32.197
authority for the first

00:30:32.263 --> 00:30:33.831
time to implement time area

00:30:33.898 --> 00:30:36.601
closures as needed gear density

00:30:36.668 --> 00:30:38.570
restrictions for require

00:30:38.636 --> 00:30:41.406
specialized equipment but I

00:30:41.472 --> 00:30:42.840
would say even perhaps more

00:30:42.907 --> 00:30:45.376
importantly SB thirteen oh

00:30:45.443 --> 00:30:47.412
nine memorializes the working

00:30:47.478 --> 00:30:50.949
group formalizes their role

00:30:51.015 --> 00:30:52.350
and breathe life into their

00:30:52.417 --> 00:30:56.221
great work going forward

00:30:56.287 --> 00:30:57.755
I think what's happened in the

00:30:57.822 --> 00:30:59.090
last two years is probably the

00:30:59.157 --> 00:31:01.059
most progressive and protective

00:31:01.125 --> 00:31:04.896
commitment by any state

00:31:04.963 --> 00:31:06.831
in the United States to deal

00:31:06.898 --> 00:31:07.732
with the way on tackle the

00:31:07.799 --> 00:31:10.001
problem but I also think

00:31:10.068 --> 00:31:12.570
we can do more nobody wants

00:31:12.637 --> 00:31:14.906
wells entanglement entangled

00:31:14.973 --> 00:31:15.974
the turtles and take with you

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.409
don't we don't our federal

00:31:18.476 --> 00:31:20.411
counterparts stone hard working

00:31:20.478 --> 00:31:22.347
members the crap please don't

00:31:22.413 --> 00:31:23.681
environmental organizations

00:31:23.748 --> 00:31:26.184
don't so huge shout out to

00:31:26.251 --> 00:31:27.385
my hometown paper the San

00:31:27.452 --> 00:31:29.153
Francisco Chronicle some of

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.355
you might have seen a published

00:31:30.421 --> 00:31:31.823
an opinion editorial last

00:31:31.889 --> 00:31:34.225
night this morning I'm going

00:31:34.292 --> 00:31:35.460
to confirm the news with

00:31:35.526 --> 00:31:37.528
broken that opinion editorial

00:31:37.595 --> 00:31:40.331
last night our department

00:31:40.398 --> 00:31:41.866
gave formal notice to our

00:31:41.933 --> 00:31:43.167
federal colleagues at the no

00:31:43.234 --> 00:31:45.903
with fisheries agency within

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:47.705
the department of commerce

00:31:47.772 --> 00:31:49.173
that we intend to submit a

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:52.076
conservation plan to minimize

00:31:52.143 --> 00:31:53.878
and hopefully eliminate the

00:31:53.945 --> 00:31:55.380
risk of entanglements from

00:31:55.446 --> 00:31:56.648
archive fisheries and to

00:31:56.714 --> 00:31:58.716
receive approval under the

00:31:58.783 --> 00:31:59.951
federal Endangered Species

00:32:00.018 --> 00:32:02.253
Act for the conservation I

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.523
checked no other state agency

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:06.791
to our knowledge is taking

00:32:06.858 --> 00:32:08.226
its commitment to protecting

00:32:08.293 --> 00:32:12.463
marine mammals thus far

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:15.099
me divert for one second

00:32:15.166 --> 00:32:16.701
climate change it's not

00:32:16.768 --> 00:32:19.203
theoretical it's not just

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:21.139
a scientific issue it's a

00:32:21.205 --> 00:32:24.642
real it's painful and it's

00:32:24.709 --> 00:32:26.177
causing impacts the people

00:32:26.244 --> 00:32:28.980
and things we care about

00:32:29.047 --> 00:32:30.281
two thousand fifteen and

00:32:30.348 --> 00:32:31.983
sixteen was a problem

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:33.351
because of our changing ocean

00:32:33.418 --> 00:32:35.320
conditions the movement of

00:32:35.386 --> 00:32:36.721
our large mammals in the

00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:39.357
ocean the interface -- with

00:32:39.424 --> 00:32:40.792
our fishing community because

00:32:40.858 --> 00:32:43.328
of a on usual to mark as a

00:32:43.394 --> 00:32:45.296
situation that may happen in

00:32:45.363 --> 00:32:48.232
the future more not less this

00:32:48.299 --> 00:32:50.101
conservation plan we're going

00:32:50.168 --> 00:32:53.237
to do will help us get a headed

00:32:53.304 --> 00:32:54.305
will help us secure

00:32:54.372 --> 00:32:56.774
federal approvals and that

00:32:56.841 --> 00:33:00.511
leads me to our vision

00:33:00.578 --> 00:33:01.913
as you heard mention the OPC

00:33:01.979 --> 00:33:03.414
has seven point five million

00:33:03.481 --> 00:33:06.818
dollars to this effort at our

00:33:06.884 --> 00:33:10.121
department we now have staff

00:33:10.188 --> 00:33:11.322
thank you senator McGuire

00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:12.757
and subcommittee for budget

00:33:12.824 --> 00:33:15.159
and assembly member ting our

00:33:15.226 --> 00:33:17.595
department and governor brown

00:33:17.662 --> 00:33:19.931
leadership working with you has

00:33:19.997 --> 00:33:22.433
produced specifics that would

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.735
be dedicated to the will and

00:33:23.801 --> 00:33:25.937
hang on that issue and here's

00:33:26.003 --> 00:33:30.541
the vision I think the vision

00:33:30.608 --> 00:33:32.410
is a future where crap stays

00:33:32.477 --> 00:33:36.447
on a holiday menus forever

00:33:36.514 --> 00:33:37.982
where coastal communities are

00:33:38.049 --> 00:33:39.951
thriving and resilience in the

00:33:40.017 --> 00:33:42.053
face of a warming climate and

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.756
changing ocean conditions and

00:33:44.822 --> 00:33:47.592
where we can all look westward

00:33:47.658 --> 00:33:48.993
look out into that magnificent

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:51.396
Pacific Ocean and see whales

00:33:51.462 --> 00:33:52.764
and turtles swimming and our

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:54.265
marine environment free from

00:33:54.332 --> 00:33:56.367
the risk of entanglement it's

00:33:56.434 --> 00:33:59.303
a good vision sound vision to

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:01.606
feasible vision we asked the

00:34:01.672 --> 00:34:03.841
support of everyone in getting

00:34:03.908 --> 00:34:05.943
there together so with that

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:06.911
let me pause and see if you

00:34:06.978 --> 00:34:07.779
have any questions for the

00:34:07.845 --> 00:34:09.881
defense secretary for me thank

00:34:09.947 --> 00:34:10.782
you so much Mister director

00:34:10.848 --> 00:34:11.916
we like that opening up to the

00:34:11.983 --> 00:34:13.451
committee for ask questions we

00:34:13.518 --> 00:34:15.653
will be going to public comment

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:18.189
twice in two days agenda once

00:34:18.256 --> 00:34:20.591
after agenda item three in in

00:34:20.658 --> 00:34:23.428
another time after item six at

00:34:23.494 --> 00:34:24.562
this time we like to go to ask

00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:28.166
the committee Mister vice chair

00:34:28.232 --> 00:34:30.134
sitting

00:34:30.201 --> 00:34:31.269
this one if you can just walk

00:34:31.335 --> 00:34:33.938
us through what this process

00:34:34.005 --> 00:34:36.574
looks like -- its first of

00:34:36.641 --> 00:34:38.643
its kind the only state in the

00:34:38.709 --> 00:34:39.944
union that will be advancing a

00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:41.746
plan like this walk us through

00:34:41.813 --> 00:34:44.282
what this looks like an I

00:34:44.348 --> 00:34:50.054
think some will com is that

00:34:50.121 --> 00:34:53.791
going first it's too risky

00:34:53.858 --> 00:34:56.260
but my rebuttal would be it's

00:34:56.327 --> 00:34:59.130
okay to be first California

00:34:59.197 --> 00:35:01.132
typically go face first on a

00:35:01.199 --> 00:35:03.968
Tana's that makes a difference

00:35:04.035 --> 00:35:07.004
nationally and internationally

00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:09.106
being first can often solidify

00:35:09.173 --> 00:35:11.309
your position as a leader

00:35:11.375 --> 00:35:12.710
even though going through

00:35:12.777 --> 00:35:13.878
something for the first time

00:35:13.945 --> 00:35:17.181
is awful and more painful

00:35:17.248 --> 00:35:18.850
so I don't have a precise

00:35:18.916 --> 00:35:20.685
road map senator but here's

00:35:20.751 --> 00:35:22.420
what I would predict are some

00:35:22.487 --> 00:35:25.323
of the pieces that will be

00:35:25.389 --> 00:35:28.459
in are coming days months

00:35:28.526 --> 00:35:31.629
first in my view we have

00:35:31.696 --> 00:35:32.830
the group assembled it's

00:35:32.897 --> 00:35:35.132
are working group they need

00:35:35.199 --> 00:35:36.701
to stay together we need to

00:35:36.767 --> 00:35:38.169
keep supporting them with

00:35:38.236 --> 00:35:39.770
investment a capacity we need

00:35:39.837 --> 00:35:44.842
to let them shape substance

00:35:44.909 --> 00:35:46.444
I see a submission of an

00:35:46.511 --> 00:35:48.513
application to our federal

00:35:48.579 --> 00:35:50.648
sister agency it would define

00:35:50.715 --> 00:35:53.417
a conservation plan you could

00:35:53.484 --> 00:35:54.852
look at the impact of the any

00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:56.487
activity on the whales are

00:35:56.554 --> 00:35:58.923
turtles it would illustrate

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:00.458
steps to monitor and embrace

00:36:00.525 --> 00:36:02.860
technology it would define

00:36:02.927 --> 00:36:04.629
the measures we would take

00:36:04.695 --> 00:36:06.397
to minimise and mitigate any

00:36:06.464 --> 00:36:09.066
impacts it could walk through a

00:36:09.133 --> 00:36:12.370
series of actions it hopefully

00:36:12.436 --> 00:36:14.171
will embrace the ramp program

00:36:14.238 --> 00:36:15.306
which is already well under

00:36:15.373 --> 00:36:19.810
way -- we would need public

00:36:19.877 --> 00:36:21.312
comment as we go through the

00:36:21.379 --> 00:36:22.747
federal Endangered Species

00:36:22.813 --> 00:36:25.349
Act process we would like we

00:36:25.416 --> 00:36:27.451
need an environmental kind

00:36:27.518 --> 00:36:29.854
of document platform for the

00:36:29.921 --> 00:36:31.656
eventual permitting decision

00:36:31.722 --> 00:36:34.191
on the federal front -- it's

00:36:34.258 --> 00:36:36.994
possible we would -- go out

00:36:37.061 --> 00:36:38.262
to public comment these are

00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:39.397
a lot of decisions that would

00:36:39.463 --> 00:36:40.565
be incumbent upon our federal

00:36:40.631 --> 00:36:42.700
sister agency we would feel

00:36:42.767 --> 00:36:44.802
responses and then we would

00:36:44.869 --> 00:36:46.070
do it -- rations of our

00:36:46.137 --> 00:36:47.505
conservation plan based on

00:36:47.572 --> 00:36:50.708
that feedback and eventually

00:36:50.775 --> 00:36:52.109
-- I see something being

00:36:52.176 --> 00:36:54.645
approved I see something

00:36:54.712 --> 00:36:56.981
memorializing are working group

00:36:57.048 --> 00:36:58.282
and I see something producing

00:36:58.349 --> 00:36:59.350
a conservation plan in the

00:36:59.417 --> 00:37:01.352
regulatory certainty that are

00:37:01.419 --> 00:37:03.454
crap fleet needs onto a federal

00:37:03.521 --> 00:37:05.823
permit will it take a month

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:09.226
ago is going to be easy not

00:37:09.293 --> 00:37:11.462
-- is a year eighteen months

00:37:11.529 --> 00:37:12.496
two years I think a little

00:37:12.563 --> 00:37:14.131
bit of that is determinative

00:37:14.198 --> 00:37:16.467
upon assembling this crowd and

00:37:16.534 --> 00:37:18.102
laying out of time on because

00:37:18.169 --> 00:37:21.539
we are going first a he said

00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:23.541
that in your right being the

00:37:23.608 --> 00:37:25.509
first is always a risk I think

00:37:25.576 --> 00:37:27.278
the risk is greater -- if

00:37:27.345 --> 00:37:29.146
there is no action required by

00:37:29.213 --> 00:37:30.414
the state of California right

00:37:30.481 --> 00:37:33.084
I agree -- and needing to be

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:35.219
able to move as quickly and as

00:37:35.286 --> 00:37:37.355
thoroughly as possible excuse

00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:38.789
me I apologize and find a call

00:37:38.856 --> 00:37:41.659
today -- in know that this is

00:37:41.726 --> 00:37:43.894
being a lot of work community

00:37:43.961 --> 00:37:44.862
days hearing to be able to

00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:47.598
make this announcement -- are

00:37:47.665 --> 00:37:48.966
you gonna need some additional

00:37:49.033 --> 00:37:53.437
resources as we move forward

00:37:53.504 --> 00:37:54.972
well that's a great question

00:37:55.039 --> 00:37:56.707
given the leadership on the

00:37:56.774 --> 00:37:58.409
panel across from me on my

00:37:58.476 --> 00:38:00.745
budget front I look for to that

00:38:00.811 --> 00:38:02.680
conversation if I'm director

00:38:02.747 --> 00:38:04.048
in two thousand nineteen and we

00:38:04.115 --> 00:38:05.483
go through the budget process

00:38:05.549 --> 00:38:06.917
I would also remind folks

00:38:06.984 --> 00:38:10.021
listening this is not the only

00:38:10.087 --> 00:38:11.155
thing our department will be

00:38:11.222 --> 00:38:14.025
doing your SB thirteen oh nine

00:38:14.091 --> 00:38:15.893
yeah requires us to complete

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.395
state based rule making some

00:38:17.461 --> 00:38:18.929
of which we started some of

00:38:18.996 --> 00:38:20.898
which we've completed other

00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:23.534
provisions we need to advance

00:38:23.601 --> 00:38:25.770
to the end that will allow

00:38:25.836 --> 00:38:27.371
us to memorialize and state

00:38:27.438 --> 00:38:29.674
law and structure the ramp

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:33.144
the working group -- and we

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:34.412
have a deadline in the state

00:38:34.478 --> 00:38:36.113
statute to complete all that

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.949
work so in my mind we will be

00:38:39.016 --> 00:38:41.786
harmonizing multiple regulatory

00:38:41.852 --> 00:38:44.188
platforms to win in goal which

00:38:44.255 --> 00:38:47.892
is that vision I describe

00:38:47.958 --> 00:38:48.926
the two thousand fifteen we

00:38:48.993 --> 00:38:50.795
had about ten wailing tackle

00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:53.064
means on average but we peak

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:54.098
in two thousand fifteen of

00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:55.800
the California coast a fifty

00:38:55.866 --> 00:38:56.801
billion with the forty eight

00:38:56.867 --> 00:38:57.702
and sixteen N. F.

00:38:57.768 --> 00:38:59.470
pretty a significant decrease

00:38:59.537 --> 00:39:00.671
in two thousand seventeen

00:39:00.738 --> 00:39:03.441
thirty one -- a what I'll say

00:39:03.507 --> 00:39:04.508
the reason why I bring that up

00:39:04.575 --> 00:39:07.745
is when we saw that peak year

00:39:07.812 --> 00:39:09.246
two thousand fifteen which was

00:39:09.313 --> 00:39:11.749
the worst year also for crap

00:39:11.816 --> 00:39:13.718
-- immediately jumped into

00:39:13.784 --> 00:39:16.520
action -- a now we wanted to

00:39:16.587 --> 00:39:19.924
create a foundation for success

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:21.392
success for my reading and

00:39:21.459 --> 00:39:23.160
feeding whales in the future

00:39:23.227 --> 00:39:25.963
-- as well as -- another strong

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:27.965
century for California story

00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:30.101
crap please I am very grateful

00:39:30.167 --> 00:39:31.402
for that I think the other

00:39:31.469 --> 00:39:32.470
item that we need to be able

00:39:32.536 --> 00:39:34.672
to discuss of which we will --

00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:36.507
later today is issue of ship

00:39:36.574 --> 00:39:39.310
strikes so -- we have been

00:39:39.376 --> 00:39:41.112
very focused on all issues

00:39:41.178 --> 00:39:43.114
seven tango and rightfully so

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.982
is unacceptable these numbers

00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:45.916
that we have in front of us

00:39:45.983 --> 00:39:47.651
are simply unacceptable I which

00:39:47.718 --> 00:39:49.253
is why you're department and

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.588
hundreds from across the state

00:39:50.654 --> 00:39:52.223
of the working out with the

00:39:52.289 --> 00:39:53.657
fleet to be able to limit the

00:39:53.724 --> 00:39:55.259
number ten comments and to be

00:39:55.326 --> 00:39:58.162
able to get that two zero and

00:39:58.229 --> 00:39:59.864
what's not talked about is

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:02.032
a number of whales that are

00:40:02.099 --> 00:40:03.834
being killed every year with

00:40:03.901 --> 00:40:05.836
commercial vessels and that is

00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:07.304
also a growing concern I know

00:40:07.371 --> 00:40:08.906
for this committee is we would

00:40:08.973 --> 00:40:10.107
for I don't know if there's

00:40:10.174 --> 00:40:11.075
any item that you would like

00:40:11.142 --> 00:40:12.042
to be able to come in a way

00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:14.912
to set if I'm still director

00:40:14.979 --> 00:40:16.380
in two thousand nineteen I

00:40:16.447 --> 00:40:17.948
would be working and focusing

00:40:18.015 --> 00:40:20.885
on that issue as well I'm very

00:40:20.951 --> 00:40:22.720
grateful -- Mister director for

00:40:22.787 --> 00:40:24.555

that -- it's just beginning --

00:40:29.794 --> 00:40:31.595
my last question for you you've

00:40:31.662 --> 00:40:32.730

00:40:32.797 --> 00:40:34.331

acid in the meat of testing

00:43:46.156 --> 00:43:47.491
crab -- this is something

00:43:47.558 --> 00:43:49.026
that's new we typically don't

close the recreational fishery

00:43:50.527 --> 00:43:51.562
from a recommendation from

third testing let were low

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:49.119
quality meat so that led to

00:44:49.186 --> 00:44:50.521
a notice from director bottom

00:44:50.587 --> 00:44:51.722

of quality testing will occur

00:44:56.727 --> 00:44:58.062
around December first two

00:44:58.128 --> 00:44:59.263
discernment to determine if

00:44:59.329 --> 00:45:01.131
we delay until December thirty

00:45:01.198 --> 00:45:03.367
first if me quality is still

00:45:03.434 --> 00:45:05.102
low another round of testing

00:45:05.169 --> 00:45:06.537
will occur to determine if

00:45:06.603 --> 00:45:07.871
we delayed until January

00:45:07.938 --> 00:45:10.307
fifteenth I'm last season we

00:45:10.374 --> 00:45:11.842
are not able to test beyond

00:45:11.909 --> 00:45:13.310
January first for quality

00:45:13.377 --> 00:45:14.845
but new authority provided by

00:45:14.912 --> 00:45:17.281
Sen requires SB thirteen ten

00:45:17.347 --> 00:45:18.882
enables us to continue testing

00:45:18.949 --> 00:45:20.884
be on January first of the

00:45:20.951 --> 00:45:22.119
season will not be delayed

00:45:22.186 --> 00:45:23.687
past January fifteenth so that

00:45:23.754 --> 00:45:25.389
testing can occur to help the

00:45:25.456 --> 00:45:28.592
fleet with a market choices

00:45:28.659 --> 00:45:30.461
-- demo gas and only the

00:45:30.527 --> 00:45:32.396
details to make our privacy

00:45:32.463 --> 00:45:33.864
at -- California department

00:45:33.931 --> 00:45:35.065
of public health but I will

00:45:35.132 --> 00:45:37.301
highlight that on this is been

00:45:37.367 --> 00:45:38.469
a long road force we've learned

00:45:38.535 --> 00:45:40.204
a lot in the last three years

00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:41.438
-- we've gotten a lot better

00:45:41.505 --> 00:45:43.107
at it and I want to thank my

00:45:43.173 --> 00:45:44.241
colleagues at the department

00:45:44.308 --> 00:45:45.876
of public health at the office

00:45:45.943 --> 00:45:46.944
environmental health hazard

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:49.580
assessment and also the fleet

00:45:49.646 --> 00:45:50.514
we still have a long way to

00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:52.816
go this is a new program --

00:45:52.883 --> 00:45:53.984
we lacked they're sufficient

00:45:54.051 --> 00:45:55.719
resources and infrastructure

00:45:55.786 --> 00:45:57.087
to make this a permanent long

00:45:57.154 --> 00:45:58.122
term program that's something

00:45:58.188 --> 00:45:58.956
I think we should all keep

00:45:59.022 --> 00:46:01.492
on our radar one of the ways

00:46:01.558 --> 00:46:02.559
we are trying to address that

00:46:02.626 --> 00:46:03.994
is through some of portion

00:46:04.061 --> 00:46:06.029
of the disaster relief funds

00:46:06.096 --> 00:46:07.731
so in early September the

00:46:07.798 --> 00:46:08.999
department submitted to spend

00:46:09.066 --> 00:46:10.334

distribute twenty five and a

00:46:13.604 --> 00:46:14.972
half million dollars a disaster

00:46:15.038 --> 00:46:16.773
funds to California dungeon is

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.909
a rock crap fisheries the vast

00:46:18.976 --> 00:46:19.977
majority those funds eighty

00:46:20.043 --> 00:46:21.411
nine percent will go towards

00:46:21.478 --> 00:46:23.614
direct payments to those fleets

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:24.948
with the balance going towards

00:46:25.015 --> 00:46:26.183
mitigation programs at a

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:27.417
small piece to P.

00:46:27.484 --> 00:46:30.254
S. NFC overhead the drafting

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.188
of the spending plan was

00:46:31.255 --> 00:46:32.789
facilitated by extensive out

00:46:32.856 --> 00:46:34.591

plan to solicit feedback

00:46:40.564 --> 00:46:41.532
the department intends to

00:46:41.598 --> 00:46:43.167
solicit request for proposals

00:46:43.233 --> 00:46:44.468
and establish a stakeholder

00:46:44.535 --> 00:46:46.403
advisory group to help develop

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:48.839
criteria and priorities for use

00:46:48.906 --> 00:46:50.607
of the mitigation funds we're

00:46:50.674 --> 00:46:51.875
still working on the details

00:46:51.942 --> 00:46:53.310
of that approach and welcome

to a delay in the season opener

00:47:34.418 --> 00:47:35.719
and to find a delay to the

00:47:35.786 --> 00:47:37.487
tri state quality or human

00:47:37.554 --> 00:47:39.756
health risk delays when areas

00:47:39.823 --> 00:47:41.225

seasons of this having clean

00:47:54.905 --> 00:47:57.007
that gives us some structure

00:47:57.074 --> 00:47:58.609
these new rules will apply to

00:47:58.675 --> 00:48:00.244

for dungeons craft also permits

00:48:23.967 --> 00:48:25.769

not going to help a hundred

00:50:12.542 --> 00:50:14.578
percent of what was lost --

00:50:14.644 --> 00:50:17.414
it was -- absolutely necessary

-- an optimistic outlook in the

face of devastating challenges

01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:38.234
-- in the face of severe

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:40.136
financial hardship and in the

01:00:40.203 --> 01:00:43.239
face of knowing that this is

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:45.975
our new normal that commercial

01:00:46.042 --> 01:00:47.210
fisheries in the state of

01:00:47.276 --> 01:00:49.178
California particularly

01:00:49.245 --> 01:00:50.580
for station fisheries crab

01:00:50.646 --> 01:00:51.614
fisheries are going to be

01:00:51.681 --> 01:00:53.249
facing the mower gas it

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:56.019
challenges -- in every single

01:00:56.085 --> 01:00:59.222
season -- that we are are

01:00:59.288 --> 01:01:01.657
going to try to -- -- whether

01:01:01.724 --> 01:01:03.126
it be here in San Francisco

01:01:03.192 --> 01:01:05.695
Bay or to the north or in

01:01:05.762 --> 01:01:08.564
states to the north -- we know

01:01:08.631 --> 01:01:09.632
that this is our new normal

01:01:09.699 --> 01:01:12.835
and that is why two weeks ago

01:01:12.902 --> 01:01:13.936
the Pacific coast federation

01:01:14.003 --> 01:01:15.972
of fishermen's associations

01:01:16.039 --> 01:01:18.107
filed a lawsuit in California

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:20.576
District Court against thirty

01:01:20.643 --> 01:01:23.880
fossil fuel industry companies

01:01:23.946 --> 01:01:26.549
for their role in producing

01:01:26.616 --> 01:01:29.819
this situation for knowingly

01:01:29.886 --> 01:01:31.954
continuously -- promoting

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:33.089
their industry and the and

01:01:33.156 --> 01:01:35.091
the products that they sell

01:01:35.158 --> 01:01:36.959
to a and the damage that it

01:01:37.026 --> 01:01:38.861
is because to a commercial

01:01:38.928 --> 01:01:41.030
fisherman and to the coastal

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:42.065
communities of the state of

01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:43.166
California and the state of

01:01:43.232 --> 01:01:46.402
Oregon these companies very

01:01:46.469 --> 01:01:48.871
the truth about the impacts

01:01:48.938 --> 01:01:50.406
that climate change will have

01:01:50.473 --> 01:01:53.709
to the oceans to society as we

01:01:53.776 --> 01:01:55.778
know it and two in particular

01:01:55.845 --> 01:01:57.480
commercial crap fisheries

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:58.815
so we will be holding them

01:01:58.881 --> 01:02:01.084
accountable and we look forward

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:02.885
to seeing them in court in

01:02:02.952 --> 01:02:04.687
the meantime we're delighted

01:02:04.754 --> 01:02:05.788
that certain parts of the

01:02:05.855 --> 01:02:07.623
state have dodged a bullet

01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:09.625
this year and that we are able

01:02:09.692 --> 01:02:11.794
to prosecute this fishery but

01:02:11.861 --> 01:02:14.030
delays continue -- commercial

01:02:14.097 --> 01:02:15.431
fishery disaster assistance

01:02:15.498 --> 01:02:16.866
is coming and we're grateful

01:02:16.933 --> 01:02:19.469
to our friends in the federal

01:02:19.535 --> 01:02:21.204
government and the California

01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:22.438
congressional delegation for

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:24.941
moving that forward -- and

01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:26.442
I just want to provide one

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:29.011
comment on the continuing

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:31.481
crisis -- the the political

01:02:31.547 --> 01:02:33.783
crisis -- and the solutions

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:35.451
that we are coming up with

01:02:35.518 --> 01:02:37.520
relating to wailing tango in

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:40.123
this fishery I do what I want

01:02:40.189 --> 01:02:41.824
to say that I am pleased to

01:02:41.891 --> 01:02:44.427
see that California is going

01:02:44.494 --> 01:02:46.262
first and stepping up to the

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:49.999
plate because when the federal

01:02:50.066 --> 01:02:52.635
process prevails fishermen

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:55.204
come last I firmly believe

01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:59.075
that the well working group is

01:02:59.142 --> 01:03:01.410
maintaining the fleets ability

01:03:01.477 --> 01:03:03.646
to be in the driver's seat and

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:07.483
to be complete and total equal

01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:09.452
participants in this process

01:03:09.519 --> 01:03:11.287
our voice matters and it's

01:03:11.354 --> 01:03:13.422
being heard our colleagues in

01:03:13.489 --> 01:03:15.625
the state of California are

01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:17.193
listening and you're gonna hear

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:18.761
from some of the members of

01:03:18.828 --> 01:03:19.996
the working group later today

01:03:20.062 --> 01:03:21.797
and public comment -- and on a

01:03:21.864 --> 01:03:24.934
panel later -- about the work

01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:27.103
that they're doing tireless

01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:29.372
hours of their lives to solving

01:03:29.438 --> 01:03:31.574
this problem the fishermen

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:32.842
do not want to see wells

01:03:32.909 --> 01:03:34.644
entangled and we are going to

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:37.280
be -- strong partners in the

01:03:37.346 --> 01:03:39.081
process to address this problem

01:03:39.148 --> 01:03:40.850
head on so with that I will

01:03:40.917 --> 01:03:42.084
be glued in thank you so much

01:03:42.151 --> 01:03:43.653
for the opportunity to give Mr

01:03:43.719 --> 01:03:45.388
outlined and the drop in on you

01:03:45.454 --> 01:03:46.556
do appreciate all three of you

01:03:46.622 --> 01:03:47.823
gentlemen for being here today

01:03:47.890 --> 01:03:48.791
we think we are open up for

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:49.625
questions or comments from the

01:03:49.692 --> 01:03:51.561
committee Mister vice chair Q.

01:03:51.627 --> 01:03:54.730
so question to the agencies

01:03:54.797 --> 01:03:57.433
mention resource I think this

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.735
committee has a interest in

01:03:59.802 --> 01:04:01.571
your success and making sure

01:04:01.637 --> 01:04:02.838
that the state is providing

01:04:02.905 --> 01:04:05.708
appropriate resources to

01:04:05.775 --> 01:04:07.443
address the issues that that

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:10.346
we are fine and to become the

01:04:10.413 --> 01:04:12.682
budget question it is going

01:04:12.748 --> 01:04:14.650
to be you have the ability to

01:04:14.717 --> 01:04:15.918
interviews but I just change

01:04:15.985 --> 01:04:17.520
composer process we of course

01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:19.989
have the ability and whatever

01:04:20.056 --> 01:04:21.190
I put pressure this point on

01:04:21.257 --> 01:04:22.491
our budgetary because I think

01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:23.392
this is something that this

01:04:23.459 --> 01:04:25.361
committee and the budget sub

01:04:25.428 --> 01:04:26.963
committees need to be looking

01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:27.997
at but I would think it would

01:04:28.064 --> 01:04:29.732
be appropriate if we could

01:04:29.799 --> 01:04:32.168
get the help of the agencies

01:04:32.235 --> 01:04:34.337
to support your working with

01:04:34.403 --> 01:04:35.972
apartment finance as well

01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:39.208
as our essential ability

01:04:39.275 --> 01:04:41.010
to make I request influence

01:04:41.077 --> 01:04:42.712
budget to ensure that you have

01:04:42.778 --> 01:04:44.113
appropriate resources and this

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:45.381
is even a bigger question that

01:04:45.448 --> 01:04:47.516
double Cassidy because water

01:04:47.583 --> 01:04:48.684
quality testing is something

01:04:48.751 --> 01:04:50.253
that has been given a short

01:04:50.319 --> 01:04:52.922
shrift in budget conversations

01:04:52.989 --> 01:04:54.557
in the past in the past number

01:04:54.624 --> 01:04:56.292
of years and yet if we're

01:04:56.359 --> 01:04:58.227
really going to create the

01:04:58.294 --> 01:05:00.396
basis for addressing changes

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:02.365
in chemistry the oceans more

01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:04.233
toxins as they come in from on

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:06.102
shore are shorter developing

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:08.404
water quality testing as well

01:05:08.471 --> 01:05:09.505
as testing the product that

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:10.706
the state's responsible for

01:05:10.773 --> 01:05:11.907
through part of public health

01:05:11.974 --> 01:05:13.743
and through that for many

01:05:13.809 --> 01:05:15.177
fish wildlife really becomes

01:05:15.244 --> 01:05:17.179
credit so I'm hoping that we

01:05:17.246 --> 01:05:19.148
can work with your agencies

01:05:19.215 --> 01:05:21.984
and they you're making proper

01:05:22.051 --> 01:05:23.753
requests that at war that

01:05:23.819 --> 01:05:24.920
working with this committee

01:05:24.987 --> 01:05:25.921
that this committee could put

01:05:25.988 --> 01:05:28.457
together a package to look at

01:05:28.524 --> 01:05:30.259
how we make requests within our

01:05:30.326 --> 01:05:31.794
budget cycles to ensure that

01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:33.729
you have the right resources

01:05:33.796 --> 01:05:35.631
without putting you on the spot

01:05:35.698 --> 01:05:37.667
it would be great to get to be

01:05:37.733 --> 01:05:39.368
able to work with you over the

01:05:39.435 --> 01:05:41.170
next couple of months and make

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:42.571
sure that we're asking and that

01:05:42.638 --> 01:05:44.040
you're asking for appropriate

01:05:44.106 --> 01:05:45.541
resources that we can back that

01:05:45.608 --> 01:05:47.443
up so that we get the testing

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:49.011
done as it needs to be done I

01:05:49.078 --> 01:05:49.779
think that's one of the things

01:05:49.845 --> 01:05:51.547
that we can do for the industry

01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:52.848
is ensure that that testing

01:05:52.915 --> 01:05:54.417
is happening appropriately

01:05:54.483 --> 01:06:00.790
smoothly and is adequately

01:06:00.856 --> 01:06:03.426
Joe like to comment on that

01:06:03.492 --> 01:06:04.560
what would come and I'd really

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:05.795
going to put you on the spot

01:06:05.861 --> 01:06:06.562
you have really should the

01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:08.931
department of finance and don't

01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:09.999
miss you want to do that but

01:06:10.066 --> 01:06:11.200
if you can help with either now

01:06:11.267 --> 01:06:12.702
or in the future on what we're

01:06:12.768 --> 01:06:14.537
talking about the way resources

01:06:14.603 --> 01:06:16.205
the scope of what we'd be

01:06:16.272 --> 01:06:18.341
happy to ask for that and how

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:21.277
we navigate the politics of

01:06:21.344 --> 01:06:23.212
administrations process in

01:06:23.279 --> 01:06:25.081
asking for its budget as well

01:06:25.147 --> 01:06:26.215
as the legislative that's it

01:06:26.282 --> 01:06:27.216
would be easier for us here

01:06:27.283 --> 01:06:29.352
but -- let's say that that

01:06:29.418 --> 01:06:30.820
getting too detailed I'd say

01:06:30.886 --> 01:06:31.921
we welcome the opportunity

01:06:31.987 --> 01:06:32.788
to work with the incoming

01:06:32.855 --> 01:06:33.956
administration to advance

01:06:34.023 --> 01:06:35.591
that every part that offer

01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:38.994
that request right thank you

01:06:39.061 --> 01:06:41.330
I to be a I would say that we

01:06:41.397 --> 01:06:43.099
service here the same use the

01:06:43.165 --> 01:06:45.201
echo the comments -- that we

01:06:45.267 --> 01:06:46.802
welcome the opportunity compare

01:06:46.869 --> 01:06:48.170
bad band with the resources

01:06:48.237 --> 01:06:49.071
we have we do the best we

01:06:49.138 --> 01:06:51.140
can and I would hope that the

01:06:51.207 --> 01:06:52.675
legislative budget process

01:06:52.742 --> 01:06:54.043
as well as the administration

01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:55.578
with respect requests coming

01:06:55.644 --> 01:06:56.846
out of this committee so is

01:06:56.912 --> 01:06:59.315
the chair but the is good I

01:06:59.382 --> 01:07:00.583
can work on that a work with

01:07:00.649 --> 01:07:02.551
the committee on what adequate

01:07:02.618 --> 01:07:04.854
resource pack I guess the right

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:06.689
-- it was a couple years back

01:07:06.756 --> 01:07:07.523
-- where I think there was some

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:09.492
frustration and -- there was

01:07:09.558 --> 01:07:11.160
about finding that was advanced

01:07:11.227 --> 01:07:13.496
both for fish and wildlife AD

01:07:13.562 --> 01:07:15.865
PH -- in we actually saw --

01:07:15.931 --> 01:07:17.366
-- department public health

01:07:17.433 --> 01:07:20.269
funding card out -- and Avalon

01:07:20.336 --> 01:07:21.237
asked the department public

01:07:21.303 --> 01:07:22.938
health to come in on that today

01:07:23.005 --> 01:07:24.340
-- but I will share with you

01:07:24.407 --> 01:07:25.941
that is incredibly frustrating

01:07:26.008 --> 01:07:28.244
because you -- have what are

01:07:28.310 --> 01:07:30.413
moving together are más on

01:07:30.479 --> 01:07:31.814
the and really the ones that

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:33.182
are doing the work for you

01:07:33.249 --> 01:07:34.817
see a lot of the funding that

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:36.118
is needed is an apartment

01:07:36.185 --> 01:07:37.620
public health side Britain's

01:07:37.686 --> 01:07:38.721
the testing so I think you're

01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:40.556
absolutely right on in the for

01:07:40.623 --> 01:07:42.291
the working with vice chair and

01:07:42.358 --> 01:07:43.859
to this committee on a fancy

01:07:43.926 --> 01:07:46.362
that I know that -- similar

01:07:46.429 --> 01:07:47.763
ting was all over that as well

01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:48.731
and make sure that we're able

01:07:48.798 --> 01:07:50.199
to see that but again we will

01:07:50.266 --> 01:07:52.835
get into -- past years looking

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:54.503
forward out we actually need

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:55.738
to ensure that our public

01:07:55.805 --> 01:07:58.007
health has that plan as is

01:07:58.073 --> 01:08:02.311
-- fish wildlife yesterday

01:08:02.378 --> 01:08:04.146
the consider aye aye what is

01:08:04.213 --> 01:08:06.482
get a better understanding of

01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:08.584
I heard a lot about testing

01:08:08.651 --> 01:08:11.053
and what the scores are not

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.656
significant amount what we can

01:08:13.722 --> 01:08:17.293
do to reverse the situation

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:18.394
I mean I know part of it is

01:08:18.461 --> 01:08:21.297
the environment easy to cast

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:23.098
fingers and other people

01:08:23.165 --> 01:08:25.067
what can we do as a state

01:08:25.134 --> 01:08:28.170
to better try to mitigate

01:08:28.237 --> 01:08:34.510
the situation in hearing

01:08:34.577 --> 01:08:35.878
-- is to take that I'd love

01:08:35.945 --> 01:08:39.415
to respond to that question

01:08:39.482 --> 01:08:40.950
the California judges crab

01:08:41.016 --> 01:08:44.119
fishery needs to be managed

01:08:44.186 --> 01:08:45.855
to become more resilient in

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:47.590
the face of what we know will

01:08:47.656 --> 01:08:50.893
be our new climate feature

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.928
which is currently what we're

01:08:52.995 --> 01:08:53.963
seeing today and what we saw

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:55.631
in twenty fifteen and that's a

01:08:55.698 --> 01:08:57.466
buzz word managing for me what

01:08:57.533 --> 01:08:58.968
does that really mean what we

01:08:59.034 --> 01:09:02.171
know that commercial fishing

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:05.774
businesses need to be stable

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:07.143
they are subjected to a new

01:09:07.209 --> 01:09:09.945
form of a risk that they were

01:09:10.012 --> 01:09:12.815
not before other industries

01:09:12.882 --> 01:09:14.950
manage their risks far better

01:09:15.017 --> 01:09:17.686
than we do in California --

01:09:17.753 --> 01:09:19.822
in commercial fisheries --

01:09:19.889 --> 01:09:22.024
we do not have any sort of

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:23.993
financial mechanism or capital

01:09:24.059 --> 01:09:26.095
facilities to be able to insure

01:09:26.161 --> 01:09:27.329
commercial fisheries in times

01:09:27.396 --> 01:09:29.532
of struggle a hardship -- make

01:09:29.598 --> 01:09:31.333
ends meet pay the bills when

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.701
boats are tied down we need

01:09:32.768 --> 01:09:35.037
to develop the financial tools

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:36.272
to be able to address this

01:09:36.338 --> 01:09:38.641
to let our fishing businesses

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:41.710
be resilient to the financial

01:09:41.777 --> 01:09:44.446
risks of of closure and delay

01:09:44.513 --> 01:09:47.550
we also need to be able to

01:09:47.616 --> 01:09:50.519
address the more gas it head on

01:09:50.586 --> 01:09:54.423
we need to know more of -- when

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:56.125
it's coming we need to develop

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.027
the predictive tools that can

01:09:58.093 --> 01:10:00.262
enable fishermen and agencies

01:10:00.329 --> 01:10:02.932
to be able to determine

01:10:02.998 --> 01:10:04.199
what business and management

01:10:04.266 --> 01:10:05.734
decisions they need to make

01:10:05.801 --> 01:10:08.637
ahead of the season otherwise

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:10.539
there are lost in the dark or

01:10:10.606 --> 01:10:14.209
we have impacts that are far

01:10:14.276 --> 01:10:15.277
less predictable and therefore

01:10:15.344 --> 01:10:16.812
far more damaging than what we

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:18.714
would otherwise encounter and

01:10:18.781 --> 01:10:19.915
then I believe that we need

01:10:19.982 --> 01:10:23.552
to develop tools that can deal

01:10:23.619 --> 01:10:25.554
with them all gas and there

01:10:25.621 --> 01:10:27.356
are certain approaches that

01:10:27.423 --> 01:10:28.824
could potentially be used --

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:30.459
decoration or the holding of

01:10:30.526 --> 01:10:31.961
crabs that are known to be

01:10:32.027 --> 01:10:33.862
toxic until the talks and can

01:10:33.929 --> 01:10:35.431
be cleared out is one solution

01:10:35.497 --> 01:10:37.967
another would be developing

01:10:38.033 --> 01:10:39.401
sensors or other devices

01:10:39.468 --> 01:10:41.270
that can more easily detect

01:10:41.337 --> 01:10:43.872
demo gases -- that technology

01:10:43.939 --> 01:10:45.341
currently exists but hasn't

01:10:45.407 --> 01:10:47.009
been implemented in this

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:48.744
way and that's why I think

01:10:48.811 --> 01:10:50.713
-- are are technologically

01:10:50.779 --> 01:10:52.014
advanced society and in the

01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:53.349
bay area here in San Francisco

01:10:53.415 --> 01:10:54.416
particular can be helpful

01:10:54.483 --> 01:10:56.719
there -- and I'll just make

01:10:56.785 --> 01:10:58.754
the the point here that these

01:10:58.821 --> 01:11:01.757
are all very expensive proposed

01:11:01.824 --> 01:11:02.591
requiring a whole bunch of

01:11:02.658 --> 01:11:04.560
capital on a lot of investment

01:11:04.627 --> 01:11:06.328
who's going to pay for the --

01:11:06.395 --> 01:11:07.396
is it going to be the fishing

01:11:07.463 --> 01:11:09.431
industry -- we we've already

01:11:09.498 --> 01:11:10.532
described the financial

01:11:10.599 --> 01:11:11.900
hardship we're dealing with is

01:11:11.967 --> 01:11:14.069
going to the taxpayer certainly

01:11:14.136 --> 01:11:15.771
the public owns the resource

01:11:15.838 --> 01:11:17.306
and has an interest in bringing

01:11:17.373 --> 01:11:19.375
an end but organization

01:11:19.441 --> 01:11:22.011
believes that the company is

01:11:22.077 --> 01:11:23.979
the fossil fuel industry is

01:11:24.046 --> 01:11:24.880
the one that should be held

01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:26.348
accountable care and that's

01:11:26.415 --> 01:11:27.416
the nature of the lawsuit

01:11:27.483 --> 01:11:31.353
that I mentioned earlier

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:32.821
and I'm not allowed it is

01:11:32.888 --> 01:11:35.157
as best robin I pointed out

01:11:35.224 --> 01:11:36.358
as with most things climate

01:11:36.425 --> 01:11:38.360
change right now it's adapting

01:11:38.427 --> 01:11:40.162
to it not tried to prevent it

01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:41.463
and I don't see this anytime

01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:43.499
soon being able to prevent to

01:11:43.565 --> 01:11:44.933
mark asset outbreaks in our

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.335
waters that the scale is too

01:11:46.402 --> 01:11:47.970
big the sciences is not as

01:11:48.037 --> 01:11:50.272
well understood -- but we can

01:11:50.339 --> 01:11:51.440
do a better job understand

01:11:51.507 --> 01:11:53.075
the biological pathways what

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:54.743
conditions in the to the

01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:56.812
production of the toxins our

01:11:56.879 --> 01:11:58.280
those toxins working their way

01:11:58.347 --> 01:12:00.082
through the food chain once

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:01.317
we understand that we may be

01:12:01.383 --> 01:12:03.485
able to move to prevention --

01:12:03.552 --> 01:12:05.020
I will note that -- of that

01:12:05.087 --> 01:12:06.588
ten percent of the disaster

01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:07.823
from that set to mitigation

01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:09.525
that's about two point five

01:12:09.591 --> 01:12:11.326
million a much of that money

01:12:11.393 --> 01:12:13.228
will go towards our indie

01:12:13.295 --> 01:12:14.163
to try to answer some of

01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:15.030
these questions and that's

01:12:15.097 --> 01:12:16.165
really what that competitive

01:12:16.231 --> 01:12:17.499
grant process is set up to

01:12:17.566 --> 01:12:19.068
do is to try to figure out

01:12:19.134 --> 01:12:22.971
how we can best adapt to it

01:12:23.038 --> 01:12:24.206
from the department's

01:12:24.273 --> 01:12:26.041
perspective -- see page

01:12:26.108 --> 01:12:27.242
public health perspective

01:12:27.309 --> 01:12:30.646
one at that our role is to

01:12:30.713 --> 01:12:32.147
Medicaid our findings the

01:12:32.214 --> 01:12:34.183
results so they can be used

01:12:34.249 --> 01:12:36.418
from the data can be used to

01:12:36.485 --> 01:12:37.386
have some kind of prevention

01:12:37.453 --> 01:12:38.954
strategies are usually use

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:46.028
for future -- -- thinking

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:47.763
so besides the rise in

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:49.098
temperature notions or

01:12:49.164 --> 01:12:51.333
any other thoughts about

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.035
what else is driving this

01:12:53.102 --> 01:12:57.039
imbalance in the system --

01:12:57.106 --> 01:12:57.940
we know that ocean

01:12:58.006 --> 01:12:59.708
acidification is also a

01:12:59.775 --> 01:13:01.543
confounding factor it's a

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:05.447
it it's likely that lower PH

01:13:05.514 --> 01:13:08.083
results in greater expression

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:10.319
of demo like acid in the

01:13:10.385 --> 01:13:12.354
algal species that produce it

01:13:12.421 --> 01:13:15.390
sit in the chair -- further

01:13:15.457 --> 01:13:16.625
exacerbating this problem of

01:13:16.692 --> 01:13:19.094
course lower PH and warming

01:13:19.161 --> 01:13:21.964
temperatures are correlated

01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:26.401
-- in addition the the large

01:13:26.468 --> 01:13:27.903
scale oceanographic phenomenon

01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:29.772
like the blog -- that we

01:13:29.838 --> 01:13:32.508
saw in general -- with just

01:13:32.574 --> 01:13:34.910
less up Welling therefore

01:13:34.977 --> 01:13:36.011
water being delivered to the

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:43.051
shelf because system is also

01:13:43.118 --> 01:13:45.821
I also just want

01:13:45.888 --> 01:13:48.123
clear fire just make make sure

01:13:48.190 --> 01:13:50.926
-- you you mentioned a number

01:13:50.993 --> 01:13:54.429
of -- potential ideas in terms

01:13:54.496 --> 01:13:56.732
of medication things at nine

01:13:56.799 --> 01:13:59.802
six situation what I would

01:13:59.868 --> 01:14:01.904
really -- saying is it's very

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:03.972
difficult to move forward with

01:14:04.039 --> 01:14:06.875
anything on a large scale in

01:14:06.942 --> 01:14:08.110
many the reason you mention

01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:09.511
without with enter standing

01:14:09.578 --> 01:14:11.647
problems so tell we really

01:14:11.713 --> 01:14:13.782
have a better understanding

01:14:13.849 --> 01:14:15.484
of what the problem is and

01:14:15.551 --> 01:14:18.320
whether it can be manage --

01:14:18.387 --> 01:14:20.789
locally and it's very difficult

01:14:20.856 --> 01:14:23.292
to say or to justify any

01:14:23.358 --> 01:14:30.132
sort of large expenditures

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:31.600
yeah I'd be delighted to

01:14:31.667 --> 01:14:33.235
commented that if -- if I

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:37.573
may um without question we we

01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:39.074
do know what the fleet knows

01:14:39.141 --> 01:14:41.043
what the problem is it's the

01:14:41.109 --> 01:14:43.412
inability to go fishing for

01:14:43.478 --> 01:14:45.347
our members and our business

01:14:45.414 --> 01:14:47.883
that is the problem and when we

01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:51.720
focus on the immediate annual

01:14:51.787 --> 01:14:53.922
scale measures that need to

01:14:53.989 --> 01:14:55.457
be taken in order to address

01:14:55.524 --> 01:14:57.826
this -- I believe that we do

01:14:57.893 --> 01:14:59.261
have some of the solutions

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:01.063
and we know precisely what

01:15:01.129 --> 01:15:03.365
we need to do from the agency

01:15:03.432 --> 01:15:06.535
perspective -- agree with with

01:15:06.602 --> 01:15:09.771
doctor she meant that we will

01:15:09.838 --> 01:15:12.140
likely not be able to take

01:15:12.207 --> 01:15:14.009
action that will prevent the

01:15:14.076 --> 01:15:16.411
trajectory that we are on --

01:15:16.478 --> 01:15:18.380
we need to acknowledge that

01:15:18.447 --> 01:15:20.515
we need to rather than trying

01:15:20.582 --> 01:15:21.984
to throw money at problems we

01:15:22.050 --> 01:15:24.453
can't solve the immediate in

01:15:24.519 --> 01:15:27.422
terms of preventing warming of

01:15:27.489 --> 01:15:30.759
the oceans -- in in our budget

01:15:30.826 --> 01:15:32.928
process we need to take action

01:15:32.995 --> 01:15:35.364
that's going to ensure that

01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:36.665
businesses can continue to

01:15:36.732 --> 01:15:38.867
operate and did to do the kinds

01:15:38.934 --> 01:15:40.302
of research which I believe we

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:42.471
can do in order to build those

01:15:42.537 --> 01:15:48.977
predictive tools that I spoke

01:15:49.044 --> 01:15:49.778
thank you so much interest

01:15:49.845 --> 01:15:52.247
in just one last comment I

01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:53.682
think that it too is we're

01:15:53.749 --> 01:15:54.850
talking about finding you

01:15:54.917 --> 01:15:55.817
know just make this comment

01:15:55.884 --> 01:15:58.921
that -- this year we're going

01:15:58.987 --> 01:16:00.689
beyond the guts of this rare

01:16:00.756 --> 01:16:02.691
-- in we're actually there's

01:16:02.758 --> 01:16:03.625
was some concern that we're

01:16:03.692 --> 01:16:06.194
seeing -- impact on me I is

01:16:06.261 --> 01:16:08.030
one of the high test up north

01:16:08.096 --> 01:16:10.098
I think -- that's an item that

01:16:10.165 --> 01:16:10.766
we're gonna want to be able

01:16:10.832 --> 01:16:12.301
to discuss how we can have to

01:16:12.367 --> 01:16:13.869
be a ticket we're gonna need

01:16:13.936 --> 01:16:16.371
to move into more advanced

01:16:16.438 --> 01:16:19.174
manner find testing -- as were

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:21.410
seen that one hundred tax I

01:16:21.476 --> 01:16:23.412
know it was isolated but --

01:16:23.478 --> 01:16:24.980
if that's going to mean any

01:16:25.047 --> 01:16:26.415
different procedures within

01:16:26.481 --> 01:16:27.683
the department not asking

01:16:27.749 --> 01:16:29.217
you to comment on issues of

01:16:29.284 --> 01:16:31.053
budget but does that mean

01:16:31.119 --> 01:16:32.688
anything different on your

01:16:32.754 --> 01:16:33.722
folks on the ground when

01:16:33.789 --> 01:16:35.023
it comes to -- individuals

01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:37.526
in the lab and testing

01:16:37.592 --> 01:16:38.493
additional time to make

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:41.129
separate to route tested meet

01:16:41.196 --> 01:16:44.266
samples of a you know it it

01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:46.101
obviously you know were I can

01:16:46.168 --> 01:16:47.002
you know we're doing the best

01:16:47.069 --> 01:16:48.036
we can with the resources we

01:16:48.103 --> 01:16:50.138
have to do additional testing

01:16:50.205 --> 01:16:53.141
-- -- when we're running these

01:16:53.208 --> 01:16:56.578
tional tests be it we've been

01:16:56.645 --> 01:16:57.579
primarily worried about the

01:16:57.646 --> 01:17:00.015
guts with that's where -- the

01:17:00.082 --> 01:17:01.416
higher acid levels to be if you

01:17:01.483 --> 01:17:03.819
will store and what we had this

01:17:03.885 --> 01:17:05.587
year is it when you're on the

01:17:05.654 --> 01:17:07.689
gods and in the me correct --

01:17:07.756 --> 01:17:09.858
in just wondering if we see the

01:17:09.925 --> 01:17:11.193
and again I want to be clear

01:17:11.259 --> 01:17:14.563
that was an isolated test sheer

01:17:14.629 --> 01:17:16.865
-- what is that going to mean

01:17:16.932 --> 01:17:18.400
additional time for your folks

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:20.369
on the ground in the lab just

01:17:20.435 --> 01:17:21.536
wondering about what that looks

01:17:21.603 --> 01:17:24.039
like for you obviously you're

01:17:24.106 --> 01:17:25.607
gonna run additional testing

01:17:25.674 --> 01:17:27.409
or to me -- yeah it's gonna

01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:28.610
require additional time and

01:17:28.677 --> 01:17:31.213
resource to run those analyses

01:17:31.279 --> 01:17:33.315
that's great she will follow up

01:17:33.382 --> 01:17:35.817
off line -- là should mean just

01:17:35.884 --> 01:17:37.452
have an additional compensation

01:17:37.519 --> 01:17:38.620
-- as we move forward here

01:17:38.687 --> 01:17:39.988
January sourcing thank you

01:17:40.055 --> 01:17:41.623
so much but before we adjourn

01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:42.524
this panel would like to be to

01:17:42.591 --> 01:17:43.458
see if we have any additional

01:17:43.525 --> 01:17:44.459
comments from committee Mister

01:17:44.526 --> 01:17:48.230

a second after a two nine six

01:17:59.107 --> 01:18:00.575
any individual can can speak

01:18:00.642 --> 01:18:01.643
with the committee I welcome

01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:02.811
to be a step up to the spike

01:18:02.878 --> 01:18:04.012
you have two minutes anyone

01:18:04.079 --> 01:18:06.615
on a on the first two panels

01:18:06.681 --> 01:18:10.652
welcome any public comment

01:18:10.719 --> 01:18:11.753
green sea no public comment

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:12.621
we're not gonna be bringing

01:18:12.687 --> 01:18:13.755
it back to committee together

01:18:13.822 --> 01:18:16.324
bring up our next panel is

01:18:16.391 --> 01:18:18.093
six panels can be focusing on

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:20.295
whale entangled in ship strikes

01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:21.296
how we're gonna be hearing a

01:18:21.363 --> 01:18:22.898
briefing and well taken efforts

01:18:22.964 --> 01:18:25.067
as well ship strike concerns we

01:18:25.133 --> 01:18:26.068
could please have the following

01:18:26.134 --> 01:18:27.502
step fort Scott been seen as a

01:18:27.569 --> 01:18:28.837
research fisheries biologists

01:18:28.904 --> 01:18:30.038
the southwest sign center with

01:18:30.105 --> 01:18:31.606
no fisheries we're grateful

01:18:31.673 --> 01:18:33.241
that beautiful consists here he

01:18:33.308 --> 01:18:35.110
is the guy on the ground for no

01:18:35.177 --> 01:18:37.012
up -- in he's a marine mammal

01:18:37.079 --> 01:18:38.380
health extremely response

01:18:38.447 --> 01:18:40.182
program manager were also great

01:18:40.248 --> 01:18:41.283
for the cut rock what is here

01:18:41.349 --> 01:18:43.185
he's a senior marine ecologist

01:18:43.251 --> 01:18:45.120
four point blue conservation

01:18:45.187 --> 01:18:47.022
science Mister Benson is gonna

01:18:47.089 --> 01:18:48.924
be focusing on the technical

01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:51.226
aspects of the entanglements

01:18:51.293 --> 01:18:52.594
in no was collaborative support

01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:54.096
of the working group efforts

01:18:54.162 --> 01:18:55.430
on a and he's gonna be going

01:18:55.497 --> 01:18:56.498
through the date out looking at

01:18:56.565 --> 01:18:58.200
the numbers the tiny locations

01:18:58.266 --> 01:18:59.968
train six said Rep Peter

01:19:00.035 --> 01:19:01.269
Peter is the person who is

01:19:01.336 --> 01:19:02.704
on the ground or if you will

01:19:02.771 --> 01:19:04.306
-- in the C. I. A.

01:19:04.372 --> 01:19:05.740
and he's gonna be given this --

01:19:05.807 --> 01:19:07.542
an update about what he's seen

01:19:07.609 --> 01:19:09.177
out there when they're focusing

01:19:09.244 --> 01:19:11.012
on entanglement and we're

01:19:11.079 --> 01:19:12.247
grateful that cut rock what is

01:19:12.314 --> 01:19:13.915
here and he's going to prison

01:19:13.982 --> 01:19:15.550
in the research which shows

01:19:15.617 --> 01:19:16.985
that management efforts to be

01:19:17.052 --> 01:19:18.653
able to guide ship trafficking

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:20.188
decrease overlap of whales and

01:19:20.255 --> 01:19:22.891
fisheries could decrease deaths

01:19:22.958 --> 01:19:24.526
-- from strikes in entanglement

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:25.994
significantly if there is a

01:19:26.061 --> 01:19:27.729
coordinated effort and that

01:19:27.796 --> 01:19:29.097
simply is not happening at

01:19:29.164 --> 01:19:30.332
the moment we're going to be

01:19:30.398 --> 01:19:32.100
de do a deeper dive on this

01:19:32.167 --> 01:19:34.102
issue later in two thousand

01:19:34.169 --> 01:19:36.004
nineteen so without further

01:19:36.071 --> 01:19:37.606
ado we're not gonna be turned

01:19:37.672 --> 01:19:39.207
over to Mister Benson with no

01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:40.442
a fisheries to be able to give

01:19:40.509 --> 01:19:42.244
us the data with well taken

01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:44.012
circular five minutes once he

01:19:44.079 --> 01:19:45.547
thank you for all the work it

01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:47.349
it's been a busy unfortunately

01:19:47.415 --> 01:19:49.451
a busy few years -- you the

01:19:49.518 --> 01:19:51.086
floor is yours at thank you

want to make it clear however

01:19:55.423 --> 01:19:57.893
that -- I -- imprisoning

in Lawrence signs with the

01:20:01.029 --> 01:20:03.498
west coast region office --

01:20:03.565 --> 01:20:05.700
and Scott Benson and I lied

01:20:05.767 --> 01:20:07.269
leatherback turtle research

01:20:07.335 --> 01:20:08.770
here in that California's

01:20:08.837 --> 01:20:10.906
west coast the state marine

01:20:10.972 --> 01:20:13.942
reptile -- and so happy to

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:15.143
do this on behalf of Wharton

01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:19.147
fan of next slide please

01:20:19.214 --> 01:20:21.650
I can we can do for you if you

01:20:21.716 --> 01:20:22.784
see next light that's perfect

01:20:22.851 --> 01:20:25.587
thank you got it okay excellent

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:26.922
all right I'm in payment of

01:20:26.988 --> 01:20:28.390
marine mammals in fishing gear

01:20:28.456 --> 01:20:29.991
is a global problem as you

01:20:30.058 --> 01:20:31.293
probably -- also where on the

01:20:31.359 --> 01:20:33.361
east coast -- where in payment

01:20:33.428 --> 01:20:35.897
of -- north Atlantic right

01:20:35.964 --> 01:20:37.832
whales is a major concern for

01:20:37.899 --> 01:20:40.802
that population -- our agency

01:20:40.869 --> 01:20:42.237
Nazarian fisheries services at

01:20:42.304 --> 01:20:43.672
unified large well in payment

01:20:43.738 --> 01:20:45.006
fishing here long the US

01:20:45.073 --> 01:20:47.108
west coast as a primary prime

01:20:47.175 --> 01:20:49.744
priority management issue --

01:20:49.811 --> 01:20:51.179
these entertainment reports

01:20:51.246 --> 01:20:53.415
are up opportunistic and

01:20:53.481 --> 01:20:55.517
clearly in under estimate of

01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:59.020
total and hang -- many factors

01:20:59.087 --> 01:21:00.155
contribute to integument

01:21:00.222 --> 01:21:01.690
reports being under estimate

01:21:01.756 --> 01:21:03.925
and has to be found by somebody

01:21:03.992 --> 01:21:04.993
other person needs know how

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:07.662
report that -- there've been

01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:09.030
four hundred fifty wailing

01:21:09.097 --> 01:21:10.799
payments reporting California

01:21:10.865 --> 01:21:13.134
since nineteen eighty two --

01:21:13.201 --> 01:21:14.869
and as you mentioned earlier

01:21:14.936 --> 01:21:16.438
there's been a recent spike

01:21:16.504 --> 01:21:18.206
in entanglements hundred

01:21:18.273 --> 01:21:19.574
seventy seven reports during

01:21:19.641 --> 01:21:20.875
two thousand fourteen to two

01:21:20.942 --> 01:21:23.044
thousand seventeen and that's

01:21:23.111 --> 01:21:24.346
actually forty percent of

01:21:24.412 --> 01:21:26.314
all contain reports since

01:21:26.381 --> 01:21:27.916
nineteen eighty two so as you

01:21:27.983 --> 01:21:29.417
mentioned before a relatively

01:21:29.484 --> 01:21:31.920
recent -- concern in terms

01:21:31.987 --> 01:21:33.054
of make getting people's

01:21:33.121 --> 01:21:36.091
attention next slide please

01:21:36.157 --> 01:21:39.127
this is the long term -- --

01:21:39.194 --> 01:21:41.663
data for this -- as you can

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:43.331
see here that a averaged

01:21:43.398 --> 01:21:44.933
about ten and ting once a year

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.068
until the late two thousands

01:21:47.135 --> 01:21:48.870
and then jumped up to thirty

01:21:48.937 --> 01:21:50.672
three on average during two

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:52.274
thousand fourteen two thousand

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:54.142
sixteen the majority the

01:21:54.209 --> 01:21:55.410
reports do originate from

01:21:55.477 --> 01:21:56.978
California all the wells

01:21:57.045 --> 01:21:58.413
roles reporters and tangled in

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:00.215
Oregon Washington again this

01:22:00.282 --> 01:22:02.183
is for the west coast region

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:04.819
-- organ California wash --

01:22:04.886 --> 01:22:07.188
or in California Washington

01:22:07.255 --> 01:22:08.757
and -- in two thousand

01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:10.125
seventeen there was twenty

01:22:10.191 --> 01:22:12.327
six confirmed entanglements

01:22:12.394 --> 01:22:14.496
thirty six reported and in

01:22:14.562 --> 01:22:15.697
two thousand eighteen were

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:16.931
actually above that number

01:22:16.998 --> 01:22:18.700
with twenty seven reported

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:22.070
and thirty six -- -- to exceed

01:22:22.137 --> 01:22:23.204
the twenty seven confirmed

01:22:23.271 --> 01:22:25.073
in thirty six reported the

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:26.574
higher number this year is

01:22:26.641 --> 01:22:28.710
apparently trivial to -- a

01:22:28.777 --> 01:22:30.578
greater -- number of anything

01:22:30.645 --> 01:22:31.680
what's coming from Washington

01:22:31.746 --> 01:22:35.684
state next slide please

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:37.419
the humpback whales and gray

01:22:37.485 --> 01:22:38.520
whales on the most commonly

01:22:38.586 --> 01:22:40.455
reported species in this is

01:22:40.522 --> 01:22:41.856
an important point here is

01:22:41.923 --> 01:22:44.025
that in California we have a

01:22:44.092 --> 01:22:47.062
-- we call a -- est a stock

01:22:47.128 --> 01:22:48.463
here and that California

01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:49.864
Oregon Washington stop with

01:22:49.931 --> 01:22:52.000
that stock is comprised of two

01:22:52.067 --> 01:22:55.003
different we not known as a

01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:57.105
distinct population segments

01:22:57.172 --> 01:22:59.174
so this is a in this case we

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.642
have an endangered Central

01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:04.612
America -- DPS any threatened

01:23:04.679 --> 01:23:07.849
Mexico DPS the be in danger

01:23:07.916 --> 01:23:09.918
Central America -- GPS as is

01:23:09.984 --> 01:23:12.253
a smaller number and so that

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:13.588
it's important to know that the

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:16.291
fees -- but no recognizes the

01:23:16.358 --> 01:23:19.361
to DPS is even though we had

01:23:19.427 --> 01:23:21.429
they are also recognized under

01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:22.464
the marine mammal protection

01:23:22.530 --> 01:23:25.166
act as a stock I hope that's

01:23:25.233 --> 01:23:27.602
clear to everyone -- gray

01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:29.738
whales are also -- entangled in

01:23:29.804 --> 01:23:32.107
this -- in these in fisheries

01:23:32.173 --> 01:23:34.376
here -- at that population has

01:23:34.442 --> 01:23:35.910
been stable since the nineteen

01:23:35.977 --> 01:23:39.180
nineties -- humpback whales

01:23:39.247 --> 01:23:41.483
have been increasing -- the

01:23:41.549 --> 01:23:42.951
blue whale population eastern

01:23:43.017 --> 01:23:44.853
north Pacific is stable and the

01:23:44.919 --> 01:23:46.721
fan will stock off California

01:23:46.788 --> 01:23:48.490
or Oregon Washington is also

01:23:48.556 --> 01:23:50.525
increasing these of the species

01:23:50.592 --> 01:23:52.193
that are primarily involved

01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:56.664
in ten next slide please

01:23:56.731 --> 01:23:57.932
this is the summary for two

01:23:57.999 --> 01:24:00.201
thousand eighteen twenty seven

01:24:00.268 --> 01:24:03.037
confirmed -- humpback whales

01:24:03.104 --> 01:24:05.740
again -- you know are the

01:24:05.807 --> 01:24:07.275
majority of the entanglements

01:24:07.342 --> 01:24:08.576
-- you've got numbers for

01:24:08.643 --> 01:24:10.779
gray well six we will one

01:24:10.845 --> 01:24:12.680
unconfirmed in well one on

01:24:12.747 --> 01:24:14.949
one confirmed one ident on

01:24:15.016 --> 01:24:19.220
identified -- day most of the

01:24:19.287 --> 01:24:20.555
payments are involved with that

01:24:20.622 --> 01:24:22.624
dodges crab fishery part that's

01:24:22.690 --> 01:24:24.526
because we know this because

01:24:24.592 --> 01:24:26.861
that fisheries marked -- well

01:24:26.928 --> 01:24:28.696
with other traps or mark well

01:24:28.763 --> 01:24:30.632
and -- I'm also a volunteer

01:24:30.698 --> 01:24:31.933
on the local discontentment

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.802
network and so when we have a

01:24:33.868 --> 01:24:35.770
says successful disentangle we

01:24:35.837 --> 01:24:38.273
can retrieve that indeterminate

01:24:38.339 --> 01:24:40.608
least in cases of -- Duchess

01:24:40.675 --> 01:24:43.511
crab -- if that was actually

01:24:43.578 --> 01:24:44.712
the fishery that was involved

01:24:44.779 --> 01:24:46.681
but other fish fish excuse

01:24:46.748 --> 01:24:48.716
me other fix your fisheries

01:24:48.783 --> 01:24:50.585
that have had inhaled whales

01:24:50.652 --> 01:24:53.221
include -- spot Peron -- that's

01:24:53.288 --> 01:24:55.156
humpbacks sable fish long line

01:24:55.223 --> 01:24:57.926
humpback gill net gray whale

01:24:57.992 --> 01:24:59.961
and hump back -- stripe shrimp

01:25:00.028 --> 01:25:02.797
spiny lobster also both compact

01:25:02.864 --> 01:25:04.399
although dungeons crab is most

01:25:04.466 --> 01:25:07.502
often -- identified expertise

01:25:07.569 --> 01:25:08.770
in about two minutes Sir thank

01:25:08.837 --> 01:25:10.905
you this is a locator issue

01:25:10.972 --> 01:25:12.974
shows locations where the most

01:25:13.041 --> 01:25:14.075
and the tech and hang which

01:25:14.142 --> 01:25:15.610
have been encountered or have

01:25:15.677 --> 01:25:17.612
been reported it's important to

01:25:17.679 --> 01:25:19.180
note here that the places that

01:25:19.247 --> 01:25:21.683
are highest are areas where

01:25:21.749 --> 01:25:23.685
much more people on the water

01:25:23.751 --> 01:25:25.553
-- southern California Monterey

01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:27.522
Bay less so in some of the

01:25:27.589 --> 01:25:31.759
more outer coast areas -- the

01:25:31.826 --> 01:25:34.829
next next number okay this is

01:25:34.896 --> 01:25:36.898
just for Dungeness crab alone

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:38.199
and in this case here we're

01:25:38.266 --> 01:25:40.702
looking at a by month -- you'll

01:25:40.768 --> 01:25:43.171
see that there are greater

01:25:43.238 --> 01:25:45.373
number reports during spring

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:48.176
and early summer it means that

01:25:48.243 --> 01:25:49.277
could be attributable to the

01:25:49.344 --> 01:25:50.478
fact that that's when humpback

01:25:50.545 --> 01:25:52.280
whales here it could also be

01:25:52.347 --> 01:25:53.748
attributable to that's the time

01:25:53.815 --> 01:25:54.983
when more people on the water

01:25:55.049 --> 01:25:56.918
and at sea conditions are more

01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:59.254
favorable to see these things

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:02.524
-- only five the forty records

01:26:02.590 --> 01:26:04.125
were before two thousand

01:26:04.192 --> 01:26:06.394
thirteen said ninety percent

01:26:06.461 --> 01:26:07.695
reported since two thousand

01:26:07.762 --> 01:26:09.531
thirteen again that coincides

01:26:09.597 --> 01:26:11.065
with the marking of the gear

01:26:11.132 --> 01:26:13.434
that's fine next what we don't

01:26:13.501 --> 01:26:15.637
know -- here in tango and get

01:26:15.703 --> 01:26:18.339
a fining integument origins --

01:26:18.406 --> 01:26:19.774
so where to focus management

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:22.043
and research efforts --

01:26:22.110 --> 01:26:23.511
understanding configurations of

01:26:23.578 --> 01:26:25.680
the gear involved knowing the

01:26:25.747 --> 01:26:26.915
number of entanglements that

01:26:26.981 --> 01:26:29.350
occur we know for sure that's

01:26:29.417 --> 01:26:31.519
an underestimate under S.

01:26:31.586 --> 01:26:32.754
understanding how we'll

01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:34.589
behavior in gear can lead

01:26:34.656 --> 01:26:36.591
to in in in payment once an

01:26:36.658 --> 01:26:38.960
interaction starts and then

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:40.261
long term understanding the

01:26:40.328 --> 01:26:41.629
outcomes of these entanglements

01:26:41.696 --> 01:26:42.897
at the animal is going to

01:26:42.964 --> 01:26:44.966
be able to survive or in

01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:47.035
reproduced as normally or if

01:26:47.101 --> 01:26:48.169
it has been compromised as

01:26:48.236 --> 01:26:50.038
a consequence of the intake

01:26:50.104 --> 01:26:52.440
interaction that's all I have

01:26:52.507 --> 01:26:54.142
thank you thank you very much

01:26:54.208 --> 01:26:55.610
Sir will be opening up coming

01:26:55.677 --> 01:26:56.511
to the committee in just a

01:26:56.578 --> 01:26:57.545
moment we're grateful that

01:26:57.612 --> 01:26:59.681
Peter focuses here he is the

01:26:59.747 --> 01:27:01.082
chairman of the ground --

01:27:01.149 --> 01:27:02.417
representing our marine mammal

01:27:02.483 --> 01:27:03.651
health industry in response

01:27:03.718 --> 01:27:05.019
program he's gonna tell us

01:27:05.086 --> 01:27:06.454
what he's been seen out in the

01:27:06.521 --> 01:27:07.956
ocean conditions as well Sir

01:27:08.022 --> 01:27:09.257
we welcome will give you a five

01:27:09.324 --> 01:27:10.158
minutes thank you for being

01:27:10.224 --> 01:27:12.226
here thank you for inviting

01:27:12.293 --> 01:27:13.962
me I will say that -- I have

01:27:14.028 --> 01:27:15.597
several of my to some tangling

01:27:15.663 --> 01:27:17.632
team with me here today --

01:27:17.699 --> 01:27:19.200
several behind me for Scott

01:27:19.267 --> 01:27:20.635
right here you might is asking

01:27:20.702 --> 01:27:21.803
to stand up for a second so

01:27:21.869 --> 01:27:23.271
we can now recognize simply

01:27:23.338 --> 01:27:25.940
guys that are on the network

01:27:26.007 --> 01:27:27.208
the latest stand up if you're

01:27:27.275 --> 01:27:28.142
part of the team's having give

01:27:28.209 --> 01:27:34.515
you around of applying right

01:27:34.582 --> 01:27:35.450
thank you for being here

01:27:35.516 --> 01:27:36.851
yeah thank you so much for

01:27:36.918 --> 01:27:39.153
for inviting me have an hour

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:40.588
presentation you give me five

01:27:40.655 --> 01:27:41.756
minutes all poll jump through

01:27:41.823 --> 01:27:43.524
this to make it happen I want

01:27:43.591 --> 01:27:46.027
to make it very clear that --

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:47.395
the complexity on how wells

01:27:47.462 --> 01:27:49.330
becoming tangled is much more

01:27:49.397 --> 01:27:51.232
complex than most people have

01:27:51.299 --> 01:27:53.101
considered and on the other

01:27:53.167 --> 01:27:55.336
side getting them disentangled

01:27:55.403 --> 01:27:57.238
is not as simple as yelling

01:27:57.305 --> 01:27:58.773
Sam Sam jump on the will cut

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:02.110
the line and so I'll take

01:28:02.176 --> 01:28:05.847
yours going after transferring

01:28:05.913 --> 01:28:07.482
area of primary speech is

01:28:07.548 --> 01:28:08.650
involved as Scott mentioned

01:28:08.716 --> 01:28:09.784
we are humpback whale in the

01:28:09.851 --> 01:28:11.452
gray well it's interesting

01:28:11.519 --> 01:28:12.887
that ten years ago the gray

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:14.055
whales were more calm than

01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:16.190
the humpbacks -- and that has

01:28:16.257 --> 01:28:19.060
switched recently and -- other

01:28:19.127 --> 01:28:20.828
species of concern of the blue

01:28:20.895 --> 01:28:21.829
whale simply because they're

01:28:21.896 --> 01:28:23.765
so large I worked on two blue

01:28:23.831 --> 01:28:25.466
whales and they're impossible

01:28:25.533 --> 01:28:26.801
to disentangle from the water

01:28:26.868 --> 01:28:28.202
is there to get their tests

01:28:28.269 --> 01:28:29.937
so big and powerful Ryan can

01:28:30.004 --> 01:28:32.073
attest to that -- north Pacific

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:33.307
right well we haven't had any

01:28:33.374 --> 01:28:35.109
of those entangled legally but

01:28:35.176 --> 01:28:37.812
as that -- species recovers

01:28:37.879 --> 01:28:39.180
if we get entangled right

01:28:39.247 --> 01:28:40.982
well on our coast is gonna

01:28:41.049 --> 01:28:43.451
be a game changer -- other

01:28:43.518 --> 01:28:44.819
species known fan well killer

01:28:44.886 --> 01:28:45.953
whale meat you will create

01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:50.591
is and -- sperm whales oops

01:28:50.658 --> 01:28:52.427
because back up there are a

01:28:52.493 --> 01:28:53.394
number of different types of

01:28:53.461 --> 01:28:58.900
entanglements -- suggested to

01:28:58.966 --> 01:29:01.569
you've gone

01:29:01.636 --> 01:29:03.037
Carillo some for some reasons

01:29:03.104 --> 01:29:04.138
jumping off in every type

01:29:04.205 --> 01:29:06.874
seven tango one we have a a

01:29:06.941 --> 01:29:09.010
-- -- about the head which

01:29:09.077 --> 01:29:11.179
usually includes the mouth and

01:29:11.245 --> 01:29:13.848
-- in damages the bailing of

01:29:13.915 --> 01:29:15.683
particular concern is when the

01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:17.552
math entanglement drops back

01:29:17.618 --> 01:29:19.854
to -- the back of the mouth

01:29:19.921 --> 01:29:22.323
so we have the head -- we have

01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:25.259
an appendage Gaines inventor

01:29:25.326 --> 01:29:28.196
please well we need to bring

01:29:28.262 --> 01:29:30.732
the flippers advance -- threat

01:29:30.798 --> 01:29:33.000
cake -- lumbar region which is

01:29:33.067 --> 01:29:35.036
a large body entanglement other

01:29:35.103 --> 01:29:37.472
peduncle and which is the tale

01:29:37.538 --> 01:29:40.308
technically flukes and the --

01:29:40.374 --> 01:29:42.710
compound complex entanglement

01:29:42.777 --> 01:29:44.212
in this particular animal

01:29:44.278 --> 01:29:45.880
it got involved with fifteen

01:29:45.947 --> 01:29:48.449
sets of here and twelve Travis

01:29:48.516 --> 01:29:50.384
and each one of the steps and

01:29:50.451 --> 01:29:52.553
involve the mouth a flipper

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:54.722
the flu and most of the body

01:29:54.789 --> 01:29:56.324
and we completely disentangled

01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:59.093
sort of free this is what -- if

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:00.762
Jackson Pollock was a fisherman

01:30:00.828 --> 01:30:02.663
what his gear would look like

01:30:02.730 --> 01:30:04.132
-- it's important to note that

01:30:04.198 --> 01:30:06.701
-- intending materials are much

01:30:06.768 --> 01:30:09.971
more diverse than simply --

01:30:10.037 --> 01:30:12.106
-- dentures crab gear -- some

01:30:12.173 --> 01:30:13.141
of the most common stuff they

01:30:13.207 --> 01:30:14.509
were seeing out there is from

01:30:14.575 --> 01:30:17.245
police blue steel rope -- the

01:30:17.311 --> 01:30:19.080
three stranded -- which is very

01:30:19.147 --> 01:30:20.815
common in the ground fisheries

01:30:20.882 --> 01:30:22.383
also the monofilament long

01:30:22.450 --> 01:30:24.051
line which is the action on the

01:30:24.118 --> 01:30:26.521
animal tends to be a like a --

01:30:26.587 --> 01:30:28.389
cheese cutting knife you can

01:30:28.456 --> 01:30:30.158
cut into the barber very easily

01:30:30.224 --> 01:30:32.026
also mention on three strand

01:30:32.093 --> 01:30:33.461
district three strand rope

01:30:33.528 --> 01:30:35.029
tends to be very abrasive and

01:30:35.096 --> 01:30:36.864
can -- can kind of cut through

01:30:36.931 --> 01:30:41.969
like sandpaper and -- looks

01:30:42.036 --> 01:30:44.071
if you go back up there --

01:30:44.138 --> 01:30:46.741
the -- -- gill nets or another

01:30:46.808 --> 01:30:48.976
-- -- issue a monofilament

01:30:49.043 --> 01:30:51.712
going out -- that tend to be

01:30:51.779 --> 01:30:53.981
completely engrossing the well

01:30:54.048 --> 01:30:58.319
and the -- -- -- keep going

01:30:58.386 --> 01:31:01.088
guys the same net -- which are

01:31:01.155 --> 01:31:03.558
-- nylon material they tend to

01:31:03.624 --> 01:31:07.028
-- -- the oil can to be able

01:31:07.094 --> 01:31:08.629
to blow through the same nasco

01:31:08.696 --> 01:31:11.432
one more and -- but they carry

01:31:11.499 --> 01:31:13.734
a lot of the -- gear on them

01:31:13.801 --> 01:31:15.670
as it was cut into the body

01:31:15.736 --> 01:31:17.004
and then we have the other

01:31:17.071 --> 01:31:18.372
-- that's another saying that

01:31:18.439 --> 01:31:19.974
which completely in in gross

01:31:20.041 --> 01:31:23.211
the -- the recent don't and

01:31:23.277 --> 01:31:24.212
-- since we're talking about

01:31:24.278 --> 01:31:25.580
aquaculture here we have a

01:31:25.646 --> 01:31:27.014
great will that got entangled

01:31:27.081 --> 01:31:29.050
in and aquaculture frame and

01:31:29.116 --> 01:31:31.118
we stir frame and we had no

01:31:31.185 --> 01:31:32.186
idea how to deal with this

01:31:32.253 --> 01:31:35.323
animal -- we've also had --

01:31:35.389 --> 01:31:38.226
just anchor chains -- of world

01:31:38.292 --> 01:31:41.229
getting tangled in encryption

01:31:41.295 --> 01:31:42.230
the injuries caused by

01:31:42.296 --> 01:31:43.965
entanglement are are quite

01:31:44.031 --> 01:31:46.000
varied and they range from

01:31:46.067 --> 01:31:49.303
irritations Chiu -- death --

01:31:49.370 --> 01:31:51.172
abrasion and chafing -- is

01:31:51.239 --> 01:31:52.173
very uncomfortable for the

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:54.642
animal we assume -- but is

01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:56.377
generally not life threatening

01:31:56.444 --> 01:31:58.412
-- we do see it quite a bit of

01:31:58.479 --> 01:32:00.581
physical defamation of a funny

01:32:00.648 --> 01:32:02.750
appendages in other parts of of

01:32:02.817 --> 01:32:04.118
the body this can affect their

01:32:04.185 --> 01:32:06.787
ability to feed officially

01:32:06.854 --> 01:32:09.323
and -- -- sometimes these

01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:11.559
defamation jerk or certainly --

01:32:11.626 --> 01:32:14.262
permanent -- we get amputations

01:32:14.328 --> 01:32:16.430
of the -- flute blades this

01:32:16.497 --> 01:32:17.932
is more catastrophic to hump

01:32:17.999 --> 01:32:20.201
back because they -- the power

01:32:20.268 --> 01:32:24.005
into their food -- and the --

01:32:24.071 --> 01:32:26.340
-- the entertainment can cause

01:32:26.407 --> 01:32:28.376
a complete application of the

01:32:28.442 --> 01:32:30.111
-- of the flukes as you see

01:32:30.177 --> 01:32:32.013
here with this great well we

01:32:32.079 --> 01:32:33.381
also get the -- here here's

01:32:33.447 --> 01:32:35.650
one in which -- we got the flu

01:32:35.716 --> 01:32:38.486
but not the rest of the well

01:32:38.552 --> 01:32:41.255
-- we also have appendages

01:32:41.322 --> 01:32:43.758
that are -- amputated this

01:32:43.824 --> 01:32:45.326
occurs both in gray whales

01:32:45.393 --> 01:32:47.094
and humpbacks this usually

01:32:47.161 --> 01:32:49.030
occurs when a line cinches

01:32:49.096 --> 01:32:50.932
around the appendage and then

01:32:50.998 --> 01:32:53.734
it -- starts to group to grade

01:32:53.801 --> 01:32:55.536
and cuts off circulation and

01:32:55.603 --> 01:32:58.739
then it instantly falls off

01:32:58.806 --> 01:33:00.441
others also nutritional stress

01:33:00.508 --> 01:33:01.409
this is one of my greatest

01:33:01.475 --> 01:33:03.911
concerns simply because it

01:33:03.978 --> 01:33:06.881
-- it -- demonstrates an

01:33:06.948 --> 01:33:07.882
immense amount of suffering

01:33:07.949 --> 01:33:09.517
that the animals going through

01:33:09.583 --> 01:33:12.219
-- -- for an animal get into

01:33:12.286 --> 01:33:13.688
this condition it takes --

01:33:13.754 --> 01:33:15.523
probably a month or two --

01:33:15.589 --> 01:33:16.857
cam like this and it's all

01:33:16.924 --> 01:33:18.960
a period of of fear and

01:33:19.026 --> 01:33:21.629
stress we also get infection

01:33:21.696 --> 01:33:23.464
an infestation of this is

01:33:23.531 --> 01:33:25.933
a gill net on agree well --

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.535
restricted disability to move

01:33:27.601 --> 01:33:29.937
and feed and and the likes

01:33:30.004 --> 01:33:31.939
to go over then we also have

01:33:32.006 --> 01:33:33.341
a direct effect of drowning

01:33:33.407 --> 01:33:37.511
the animal on on the net

01:33:37.578 --> 01:33:38.746
-- there's a bunch of

01:33:38.813 --> 01:33:40.581
contributing factors is much

01:33:40.648 --> 01:33:42.049
more complex than simply a

01:33:42.116 --> 01:33:44.885
well encountering the -- of the

01:33:44.952 --> 01:33:47.121
fishing gear a lot of it has

01:33:47.188 --> 01:33:48.756
to do with the well behavior

01:33:48.823 --> 01:33:49.790
a you can see right here that

01:33:49.857 --> 01:33:51.325
this impact is on its side this

01:33:51.392 --> 01:33:52.827
in normal feeding posture for

01:33:52.893 --> 01:33:54.695
a humpback whale and you can

01:33:54.762 --> 01:33:56.297
see the -- crap you're in the

01:33:56.364 --> 01:33:58.699
background and so when the line

01:33:58.766 --> 01:34:00.468
is vertical and in the water

01:34:00.534 --> 01:34:02.069
and will speeding on its side

01:34:02.136 --> 01:34:03.904
where there's a high density of

01:34:03.971 --> 01:34:06.774
-- crab traps it gets into the

01:34:06.841 --> 01:34:08.909
mouth of the well for easily

01:34:08.976 --> 01:34:10.711
and what happens is that line

01:34:10.778 --> 01:34:12.213
migrates to the back of the

01:34:12.279 --> 01:34:13.814
mouth and then starts to cut

01:34:13.881 --> 01:34:15.082
through the webbing in the

01:34:15.149 --> 01:34:16.617
back of the mouth is is if you

01:34:16.684 --> 01:34:18.586
took dental floss and you took

01:34:18.652 --> 01:34:21.022
your mouth back here years and

01:34:21.088 --> 01:34:22.823
and that -- diminishes the the

01:34:22.890 --> 01:34:25.326
efficiency of feeding -- they

01:34:25.393 --> 01:34:26.394
get to click it again to make

01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:28.262
this video role others also

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:29.830
the well behavior that they

01:34:29.897 --> 01:34:31.932
they love to twist and turn

01:34:31.999 --> 01:34:33.200
him by looking at some of the

01:34:33.267 --> 01:34:34.602
underwater behavior the and we

01:34:34.668 --> 01:34:35.970
can kind of see how they get

01:34:36.037 --> 01:34:37.772
wrapped up in loose line in the

01:34:37.838 --> 01:34:39.440
water this doesn't happen as

01:34:39.507 --> 01:34:41.175
much of the line is tight this

01:34:41.242 --> 01:34:43.210
loose in the water you can get

01:34:43.277 --> 01:34:45.446
pretty severe others also the

01:34:45.513 --> 01:34:47.014
rogue behavior something that

01:34:47.081 --> 01:34:48.916
-- -- line of investigation

01:34:48.983 --> 01:34:50.217
we're going down with the help

01:34:50.284 --> 01:34:51.218
of some of the people in this

01:34:51.285 --> 01:34:54.021
room electric Aug and -- John

01:34:54.088 --> 01:34:56.157
mail or and and Jim Anderson

01:34:56.223 --> 01:34:57.458
is trying to understand what

01:34:57.525 --> 01:35:00.161
it is about -- this line if you

01:35:00.227 --> 01:35:01.262
look at this there's a number

01:35:01.328 --> 01:35:04.265
of loops -- splices knocks and

01:35:04.331 --> 01:35:06.834
float that all contributed to

01:35:06.901 --> 01:35:09.403
the complexity of the intent

01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:11.138
of meant that twisted that

01:35:11.205 --> 01:35:12.873
then became very severe and so

01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:15.509
we're looking down -- ways to

01:35:15.576 --> 01:35:18.479
simplify the rogue behavior so

01:35:18.546 --> 01:35:20.714
that -- the way -- will will be

01:35:20.781 --> 01:35:22.817
less likely to become entangled

01:35:22.883 --> 01:35:24.385
pointing counters the line

01:35:24.452 --> 01:35:27.021
and I think this is a very --

01:35:27.088 --> 01:35:28.322
-- beneficial line of thought

01:35:28.389 --> 01:35:31.592
to go down effect okay that's

01:35:31.659 --> 01:35:33.761
actually good -- to back it

01:35:33.828 --> 01:35:35.830
up please I just gonna say are

01:35:35.896 --> 01:35:37.198
responding to large one tangle

01:35:37.264 --> 01:35:39.500
Mrs is a very large team effort

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:41.735
-- we have for organizations

01:35:41.802 --> 01:35:43.504
in addition to the five --

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:45.639
stranding network members --

01:35:45.706 --> 01:35:48.342
that all participate -- in this

01:35:48.409 --> 01:35:50.878
-- it starts with very good

01:35:50.945 --> 01:35:53.214
information -- such as the --

01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:55.749
response cards -- a number of

01:35:55.816 --> 01:35:57.251
years ago just before you saw a

01:35:57.318 --> 01:35:59.487
big spike in report is we self

01:35:59.553 --> 01:36:00.921
published something that I've

01:36:00.988 --> 01:36:02.590
I've shared with everybody --

01:36:02.656 --> 01:36:04.458
to help educate the public on

01:36:04.525 --> 01:36:06.627
what to do to -- get as good

01:36:06.694 --> 01:36:08.796
information so we can -- get

01:36:08.863 --> 01:36:11.999
out there and -- and affected

01:36:12.066 --> 01:36:13.467
just entanglement a number

01:36:13.534 --> 01:36:14.869
of factors are considered in

01:36:14.935 --> 01:36:16.270
advance of actually doing to

01:36:16.337 --> 01:36:17.638
disentangle men and they're

01:36:17.705 --> 01:36:18.839
all listed here I could talk

01:36:18.906 --> 01:36:20.074
for an hour on everyone of

01:36:20.141 --> 01:36:22.276
those but essentially it's is

01:36:22.343 --> 01:36:25.045
not simply a reaction is that

01:36:25.112 --> 01:36:26.780
we consider lots of different

01:36:26.847 --> 01:36:30.217
-- aspects all to -- reduce

01:36:30.284 --> 01:36:31.218
suffering in the well and

01:36:31.285 --> 01:36:32.720
Max my safety for the respond

01:36:32.786 --> 01:36:34.788
-- so -- once we launch an

01:36:34.855 --> 01:36:36.423
entangled will response we have

01:36:36.490 --> 01:36:37.591
these other things that we go

01:36:37.658 --> 01:36:39.894
through we have a process from

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:42.396
of the analysis to evaluating

01:36:42.463 --> 01:36:43.664
the demeanor of the whale

01:36:43.731 --> 01:36:44.698
trying to figure out how long

01:36:44.765 --> 01:36:46.233
entanglement spent on the

01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:49.370
likelihood of success -- we we

01:36:49.436 --> 01:36:53.340
need to hit it to get the --

01:36:53.407 --> 01:36:56.544
video going what back it up

01:36:56.610 --> 01:36:57.545
but one of the things we try

01:36:57.611 --> 01:36:59.313
to do I think if you click it

01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:01.815
digital video overall we tried

01:37:01.882 --> 01:37:04.618
but never on -- what this does

01:37:04.685 --> 01:37:05.653
is -- when I'm trying to show

01:37:05.719 --> 01:37:07.955
here is that we try to reduce

01:37:08.022 --> 01:37:09.156
the system so that all we

01:37:09.223 --> 01:37:11.559
have to do is one cut and if

01:37:11.625 --> 01:37:13.060
this video role that you would

01:37:13.127 --> 01:37:15.229
see us actually -- a Houston

01:37:15.296 --> 01:37:17.464
right to just cut once that's

01:37:17.531 --> 01:37:20.467
right memory better -- so

01:37:20.534 --> 01:37:21.735
it's going to invest the next

01:37:21.802 --> 01:37:22.970
one of our biggest concerns

01:37:23.037 --> 01:37:24.838
is it didn't mean or the well

01:37:24.905 --> 01:37:27.775
-- I'd I can say that on very

01:37:27.841 --> 01:37:29.109
rare occasions just the well

01:37:29.176 --> 01:37:30.477
actually understand why were

01:37:30.544 --> 01:37:33.214
there and so we get situations

01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:34.982
like this if you look in the

01:37:35.049 --> 01:37:36.417
uppermost on the left there's

01:37:36.483 --> 01:37:37.985
little silvery object that's

01:37:38.052 --> 01:37:39.987
are cutting tool and this

01:37:40.054 --> 01:37:41.855
represents away all that that

01:37:41.922 --> 01:37:43.591
-- Beatriz looks three times a

01:37:43.657 --> 01:37:45.893
and -- -- trying to get out of

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:48.562
the intent of an after Kerr we

01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:49.863
have a bunch of custom tools

01:37:49.930 --> 01:37:52.633
that we work with and -- most

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:54.768
of them are designed -- by our

01:37:54.835 --> 01:37:57.471
members -- for various purposes

01:37:57.538 --> 01:37:58.806
and approaches we are telling

01:37:58.872 --> 01:38:00.007
the truth on the far right

01:38:00.074 --> 01:38:02.142
cutting tools in the middle

01:38:02.209 --> 01:38:03.711
-- one of our secondary goals

01:38:03.777 --> 01:38:06.180
is retrieving the gear -- this

01:38:06.247 --> 01:38:08.315
was -- that animal a crescent

01:38:08.382 --> 01:38:10.784
city that had -- fifteen sets

01:38:10.851 --> 01:38:12.453
and twelve traps in each set

01:38:12.519 --> 01:38:14.154
we retrieve all of the gear

01:38:14.221 --> 01:38:15.222
we don't want to leave any

01:38:15.289 --> 01:38:17.391
crap in the water and so my

01:38:17.458 --> 01:38:19.526
team works very diligently to

01:38:19.593 --> 01:38:21.061
retrieve all of the venture

01:38:21.128 --> 01:38:22.663
with some water we don't want

01:38:22.730 --> 01:38:24.064
ghost gear we don't want to

01:38:24.131 --> 01:38:26.767
-- plastics in the ocean we're

01:38:26.834 --> 01:38:28.135
also developing responding

01:38:28.202 --> 01:38:30.304
partners on the California

01:38:30.371 --> 01:38:31.705
department of fish and wildlife

01:38:31.772 --> 01:38:33.207
to will become a part of this

01:38:33.274 --> 01:38:35.009
with their boats like -- marlin

01:38:35.075 --> 01:38:36.043
and some near the books they

01:38:36.110 --> 01:38:37.778
have Coast Guard we need to

01:38:37.845 --> 01:38:38.946
get some training together to

01:38:39.013 --> 01:38:40.714
get them up the last couple

01:38:40.781 --> 01:38:42.549
of years they responded really

01:38:42.616 --> 01:38:44.184
really well I've asked for a --

01:38:44.251 --> 01:38:46.487
twenty foot -- rapid response

01:38:46.553 --> 01:38:48.322
the they gave me a -- cutter

01:38:48.389 --> 01:38:50.891
the last time so they're being

01:38:50.958 --> 01:38:52.860
very involved -- the network is

01:38:52.926 --> 01:38:54.395
several needs not the least of

01:38:54.461 --> 01:38:56.030
which is reimbursable response

01:38:56.096 --> 01:38:58.365
costs and I will say that in

the -- on the bass fishing

01:39:19.753 --> 01:39:21.188
fishing game needs to have its

01:39:21.255 --> 01:39:22.856
in the show on this outreach

01:39:22.923 --> 01:39:25.259
material -- we need training

01:39:25.326 --> 01:39:27.261
and cross training -- monks

01:39:27.328 --> 01:39:28.329
not only all the network

01:39:28.395 --> 01:39:30.664
members but -- but also the

01:39:30.731 --> 01:39:32.533
government agencies and I'll

01:39:32.599 --> 01:39:33.701
I'll mention very quickly at

01:39:33.767 --> 01:39:35.703
the bottom -- we need support

01:39:35.769 --> 01:39:37.438
for research for understanding

01:39:37.504 --> 01:39:39.006
how the becoming tangled and I

01:39:39.073 --> 01:39:40.507
also mentioned DS W.

01:39:40.574 --> 01:39:43.177
DSW disaster service worker

01:39:43.243 --> 01:39:44.478
of thing it's a program in

01:39:44.545 --> 01:39:46.947
the state already at present

01:39:47.014 --> 01:39:48.449
none of our respond or is

01:39:48.515 --> 01:39:50.150
have any sort of insurance for

01:39:50.217 --> 01:39:51.685
doing something is stream we

01:39:51.752 --> 01:39:54.521
dangerous and I was on the --

01:39:54.588 --> 01:39:57.224
-- the paradise -- Sarmatian

01:39:57.291 --> 01:39:58.692
over the last few weeks and

01:39:58.759 --> 01:39:59.760
all of us were covered by

01:39:59.827 --> 01:40:01.762
the state program called DSW

01:40:01.829 --> 01:40:02.663
and something I would like

01:40:02.730 --> 01:40:05.232
to see is that the large well

01:40:05.299 --> 01:40:07.134
-- integument responders can

01:40:07.201 --> 01:40:09.403
be covered under the disaster

01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:12.306
service workers -- workmen's

01:40:12.373 --> 01:40:13.640
compensation is essentially

01:40:13.707 --> 01:40:15.476
what it is for and and I think

01:40:15.542 --> 01:40:18.512
that will help only qualified

01:40:18.579 --> 01:40:20.180
responders to get out there

01:40:20.247 --> 01:40:21.382
and do it rather than having

01:40:21.448 --> 01:40:22.950
people that figure that they

01:40:23.016 --> 01:40:24.351
can have a quick path to get

01:40:24.418 --> 01:40:25.586
on the Ellen DeGeneres show

01:40:25.652 --> 01:40:28.389
by jumping on a will so we're

01:40:28.455 --> 01:40:29.423
gonna be conclude here pretty

01:40:29.490 --> 01:40:31.358
quick that's my last one eighty

01:40:31.425 --> 01:40:32.626
two so we want to say thank

01:40:32.693 --> 01:40:33.861
you for all of your work were

01:40:33.927 --> 01:40:35.162
very very grateful that we have

01:40:35.229 --> 01:40:36.463
questions but what do a right

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:37.531
after we hear from current

01:40:37.598 --> 01:40:39.233
rock which is a senior Marino

01:40:39.299 --> 01:40:40.601
ecologists with point look

01:40:40.667 --> 01:40:42.136
conservation service we've

01:40:42.202 --> 01:40:43.804
heard about -- not only the

01:40:43.871 --> 01:40:45.272
extreme challenges but just as

01:40:45.339 --> 01:40:47.207
disturbing images and why it is

01:40:47.274 --> 01:40:50.911
so -- that we act together to

01:40:50.978 --> 01:40:53.580
be able to protect California's

01:40:53.647 --> 01:40:55.783
majestic well population here

01:40:55.849 --> 01:40:57.551
and we have another challenge a

01:40:57.618 --> 01:40:59.486
and nowadays ship strikes with

01:40:59.553 --> 01:41:02.022
large commercial vessels cut

01:41:02.089 --> 01:41:03.724
is going to be doing our first

01:41:03.791 --> 01:41:05.058
dive into this issue we're

01:41:05.125 --> 01:41:06.226
going to do a deeper dive later

01:41:06.293 --> 01:41:07.795
this year the bill to give you

01:41:07.861 --> 01:41:08.896
Creek preview we're grateful

01:41:08.962 --> 01:41:09.797
Mister rock with a service

01:41:09.863 --> 01:41:13.600
record your five minutes

01:41:13.667 --> 01:41:14.635
we're gonna be here might

01:41:14.701 --> 01:41:15.836
just make sure it's green and

01:41:15.903 --> 01:41:16.904
you have a pull that up if

01:41:16.970 --> 01:41:18.305
you don't mind is beautiful

01:41:18.372 --> 01:41:20.307
working for good all right

01:41:20.374 --> 01:41:23.610
thank you guys for inviting

01:41:23.677 --> 01:41:25.546
-- as the senator mentioned

01:41:25.612 --> 01:41:27.748
earlier entanglements are

01:41:27.815 --> 01:41:29.049
important issue this is a

01:41:29.116 --> 01:41:30.584
meeting about sustainability

01:41:30.651 --> 01:41:32.953
fishery conservation of whales

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:35.489
but -- this in ten minutes she

01:41:35.556 --> 01:41:37.291
doesn't happen in isolation

01:41:37.357 --> 01:41:38.859
ship strikes are part of the

01:41:38.926 --> 01:41:40.227
bigger picture so I've been

01:41:40.294 --> 01:41:42.262
tasked with giving you a little

01:41:42.329 --> 01:41:48.101
bit of that broader perspective

01:41:48.168 --> 01:41:49.736
so at point blue one of the

01:41:49.803 --> 01:41:51.472
things that we do work on is

01:41:51.538 --> 01:41:52.706
trying to understand the ship

01:41:52.773 --> 01:41:54.675
strikes issue as long as well

01:41:54.741 --> 01:41:56.510
as -- working on entanglements

01:41:56.577 --> 01:41:57.578
it'll give you a little bit

01:41:57.644 --> 01:41:59.713
of a brief presentation at the

01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:02.616
end -- but my research focuses

01:42:02.683 --> 01:42:05.252
on -- decreasing well gas from

01:42:05.319 --> 01:42:08.055
collisions with ships and we

01:42:08.121 --> 01:42:09.556
publish some work last year

01:42:09.623 --> 01:42:13.494
that it was intended to --

01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:14.862
filled what it's been a long

01:42:14.928 --> 01:42:17.197
standing gap in understand a

01:42:17.264 --> 01:42:19.199
and died and understand the

01:42:19.266 --> 01:42:20.434
numbers of whales that are

01:42:20.501 --> 01:42:22.569
being killed by ships out in

01:42:22.636 --> 01:42:24.705
our oceans on the west coast --

01:42:24.771 --> 01:42:27.074
to do that we used calculations

01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:28.976
based on what is -- originally

01:42:29.042 --> 01:42:30.944
enabling counter model train

01:42:31.011 --> 01:42:32.713
understand how often two ships

01:42:32.779 --> 01:42:34.081
come in contact with each other

01:42:34.147 --> 01:42:36.049
we did that instead for ships

01:42:36.116 --> 01:42:39.019
and rails -- and were able to

01:42:39.086 --> 01:42:40.654
then estimate the number of

01:42:40.721 --> 01:42:43.891
deaths for humpbacks fin whales

01:42:43.957 --> 01:42:45.492
and blue whales along the west

01:42:45.559 --> 01:42:47.928
coast are we could not do that

01:42:47.995 --> 01:42:49.129
for gray well because we do not

01:42:49.196 --> 01:42:50.831
have the underlying data to do

01:42:50.898 --> 01:42:55.802
so -- and when we look at the

01:42:55.869 --> 01:42:59.606
results of those -- ladies what

01:42:59.673 --> 01:43:01.542
we find is that it is likely

01:43:01.608 --> 01:43:02.943
that more than eighty whales in

01:43:03.010 --> 01:43:05.045
total among those three species

01:43:05.112 --> 01:43:07.481
are struck by ships each year

01:43:07.548 --> 01:43:09.349
are within the whole west coast

01:43:09.416 --> 01:43:12.152
federal waters and so or blue

01:43:12.219 --> 01:43:13.520
as a number of different for

01:43:13.587 --> 01:43:14.688
the different species for we

01:43:14.755 --> 01:43:16.323
will fax eighteen per year

01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:18.392
humpback whales are twenty two

01:43:18.458 --> 01:43:21.194
and fin whales forty three and

01:43:21.261 --> 01:43:22.563
that means that for blue else

01:43:22.629 --> 01:43:24.631
that's about eight times and

01:43:24.698 --> 01:43:26.567
for how back about twice the

01:43:26.633 --> 01:43:29.670
federal guidelines that suggest

01:43:29.736 --> 01:43:31.705
that set the number of human

01:43:31.772 --> 01:43:33.073
because mortalities that should

01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:35.809
occur from all combined sources

01:43:35.876 --> 01:43:38.211
and not just ships right so

01:43:38.278 --> 01:43:40.747
we're getting a lot of death

01:43:40.814 --> 01:43:44.151
beyond just -- the net or from

01:43:44.217 --> 01:43:45.686
ship strikes back go beyond

01:43:45.752 --> 01:43:49.189
that -- acceptable number

01:43:49.256 --> 01:43:50.591
if we look a little bit more

01:43:50.657 --> 01:43:52.793
closely on the distribution

01:43:52.859 --> 01:43:54.695
this is representing the top

01:43:54.761 --> 01:43:56.930
ten percent of -- mortality

01:43:56.997 --> 01:43:58.999
estimates and you can see

01:43:59.066 --> 01:44:01.935
that the those high -- high

01:44:02.002 --> 01:44:03.470
risk areas are concentrated

01:44:03.537 --> 01:44:04.438
off because California

01:44:04.504 --> 01:44:06.540
particularly central California

01:44:06.607 --> 01:44:08.275
and southern California --

01:44:08.342 --> 01:44:09.876
but the good news is that we

01:44:09.943 --> 01:44:12.813
can -- address a lot about

01:44:12.879 --> 01:44:13.747
seventy four percent of the

01:44:13.814 --> 01:44:15.082
blue whale eighty two percent

01:44:15.148 --> 01:44:16.850
a humpback whale and sixty

01:44:16.917 --> 01:44:18.752
five percent of been whale

01:44:18.819 --> 01:44:20.621
deaths by looking specifically

01:44:20.687 --> 01:44:22.122
at these regions so we don't

01:44:22.189 --> 01:44:23.857
have to think about the whole

01:44:23.924 --> 01:44:25.492
-- coast coastal waters we

01:44:25.559 --> 01:44:30.397
can look at a smaller area

01:44:30.464 --> 01:44:32.733
-- there are proven solutions

01:44:32.799 --> 01:44:34.935
and the main ones that have

01:44:35.002 --> 01:44:37.270
been really tested and and

01:44:37.337 --> 01:44:39.706
and shown to have success had

01:44:39.773 --> 01:44:40.874
been done on the east coast

01:44:40.941 --> 01:44:43.043
for for blank right whales and

01:44:43.110 --> 01:44:44.578
those are speed restrictions

01:44:44.645 --> 01:44:46.446
and the traffic routing to

01:44:46.513 --> 01:44:49.216
avoid rail hot spot so knowing

01:44:49.282 --> 01:44:50.784
where the wheels congregate

01:44:50.851 --> 01:44:53.620
-- and as best possible

01:44:53.687 --> 01:44:54.955
providing ship shipping

01:44:55.022 --> 01:44:57.157
routes that avoid those --

01:44:57.224 --> 01:44:58.725
those areas there are other

01:44:58.792 --> 01:45:00.427
potential solutions that are

01:45:00.494 --> 01:45:01.028
being explored but these are

01:45:00.961 --> 01:45:02.462
explored but these are really

01:45:02.529 --> 01:45:04.498
the only current solutions

01:45:04.564 --> 01:45:05.666
that we have and they they

01:45:05.732 --> 01:45:10.871
happen to be successful

01:45:10.937 --> 01:45:12.706
so just to put that in

01:45:12.773 --> 01:45:14.107
perspective you can see our

01:45:14.174 --> 01:45:15.942
estimates force ship strike

01:45:16.009 --> 01:45:18.011
mortality there on the left

01:45:18.078 --> 01:45:19.946
for each of the species and

01:45:20.013 --> 01:45:22.382
that's compared to the annual

01:45:22.449 --> 01:45:24.351
estimates from no -- for

01:45:24.418 --> 01:45:26.520
entanglements which are for

01:45:26.586 --> 01:45:28.855
hunt backs fourteen per year

01:45:28.922 --> 01:45:31.558
about one blue whale per year

01:45:31.625 --> 01:45:32.659
on these are for the lack of

01:45:32.726 --> 01:45:34.594
average for the last five years

01:45:34.661 --> 01:45:38.165
and a half of an where -- and

01:45:38.231 --> 01:45:40.100
so you you get the sense that

01:45:40.167 --> 01:45:42.636
for humpbacks these two sources

01:45:42.703 --> 01:45:45.272
-- -- death a human because

01:45:45.338 --> 01:45:47.007
that are about on the same

01:45:47.074 --> 01:45:48.875
level but for blue whales and

01:45:48.942 --> 01:45:50.343
fin whales ship strikes are

01:45:50.410 --> 01:45:52.345
actually much greater issue

01:45:52.412 --> 01:45:54.081
than entanglement although

01:45:54.147 --> 01:45:56.883
again with caution the wells --

01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:59.119
we're just recently first found

01:45:59.186 --> 01:46:00.921
to be entangled in last year so

01:46:00.987 --> 01:46:04.357
that may be an emerging issue

01:46:04.424 --> 01:46:05.692
so also just a quickly give

01:46:05.759 --> 01:46:07.594
you a little bit of preliminary

01:46:07.661 --> 01:46:08.662
work to be done on the

01:46:08.729 --> 01:46:11.431
entitlement -- issues directly

01:46:11.498 --> 01:46:14.901
-- we have been taking data

01:46:14.968 --> 01:46:17.771
with -- right without see

01:46:17.838 --> 01:46:20.741
-- cruises shipboard cruises

01:46:20.807 --> 01:46:22.876
on both whales and crap part

01:46:22.943 --> 01:46:25.245
densities -- for a number of

01:46:25.312 --> 01:46:26.847
years and since two thousand

01:46:26.913 --> 01:46:29.416
and eight we've been -- we've

01:46:29.483 --> 01:46:30.617
been counting the the crap

01:46:30.684 --> 01:46:31.451
parts that we see in the

01:46:31.518 --> 01:46:34.821
water so with some preliminary

01:46:34.888 --> 01:46:38.291
analyses we've actually put

01:46:38.358 --> 01:46:39.960
together some models about

01:46:40.026 --> 01:46:41.428
the distribution of crap parts

01:46:41.495 --> 01:46:43.997
which are hard to -- to get

01:46:44.064 --> 01:46:45.398
that information and so this

01:46:45.465 --> 01:46:48.802
is kind of a an initial --

01:46:48.869 --> 01:46:51.171
asks Atty understanding where

01:46:51.238 --> 01:46:54.107
are and and the temporal --

01:46:54.174 --> 01:46:56.576
changes that occur -- through

01:46:56.643 --> 01:46:58.445
time and and and for the

01:46:58.512 --> 01:47:00.413
years that we have done those

01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:01.782
analyses from two thousand

01:47:01.848 --> 01:47:02.883
and eight to two thousand and

01:47:02.949 --> 01:47:04.785
seventeen we can break those up

01:47:04.851 --> 01:47:06.553
into sort for years which are

01:47:06.620 --> 01:47:08.488
warmer water years and cooler

01:47:08.555 --> 01:47:11.224
years and find that in the

01:47:11.291 --> 01:47:13.527
warmer water years but appear

01:47:13.593 --> 01:47:15.362
to be construed close to the

01:47:15.428 --> 01:47:17.731
shore and at higher densities

01:47:17.798 --> 01:47:20.534
than in the cooler years and

01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:23.236
that is particularly during

01:47:23.303 --> 01:47:26.106
may of those years -- because

01:47:26.173 --> 01:47:28.809
that's when we have data for

01:47:28.875 --> 01:47:30.177
so that is of interest in

01:47:30.243 --> 01:47:32.412
understanding how co occurrence

01:47:32.479 --> 01:47:34.815
between whales and crab pot

01:47:34.881 --> 01:47:37.017
-- plays out and if we look

01:47:37.083 --> 01:47:40.120
at combining our models for

01:47:40.187 --> 01:47:41.354
this regional sales and the

01:47:41.421 --> 01:47:42.989
distribution of crap parts

01:47:43.056 --> 01:47:45.725
we see that in general -- on

01:47:45.792 --> 01:47:47.427
the left those two are the

01:47:47.494 --> 01:47:50.030
observed entanglements and the

01:47:50.096 --> 01:47:52.232
predicted model results of a

01:47:52.299 --> 01:47:53.667
co occurrence between wells and

01:47:53.733 --> 01:47:55.936
car parts and in general those

01:47:56.002 --> 01:47:58.672
preliminary models show --

01:47:58.738 --> 01:48:00.473
that the that is capturing that

01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:02.142
-- increasing trend in recent

01:48:02.209 --> 01:48:04.711
years -- with improvements we

01:48:04.778 --> 01:48:07.247
can probably get better and

01:48:07.314 --> 01:48:10.617
we also see that -- occurrence

01:48:10.684 --> 01:48:12.385
of these maps here show co

01:48:12.452 --> 01:48:15.255
current and is also stronger in

01:48:15.322 --> 01:48:18.124
those and former -- water for

01:48:18.191 --> 01:48:21.027
years and closer into shore so

01:48:21.094 --> 01:48:23.330
we're looking at -- potentially

01:48:23.396 --> 01:48:24.731
some of the causes for this

01:48:24.798 --> 01:48:29.135
recent spike in entertainment

01:48:29.202 --> 01:48:30.971
and that's all I have for

01:48:31.037 --> 01:48:32.272
now so if you have any

01:48:32.339 --> 01:48:34.374
questions the switches

01:48:34.441 --> 01:48:35.375
record when we open it up

01:48:35.442 --> 01:48:36.676
to the comedian seat by Chad

01:48:36.743 --> 01:48:39.179
any questions or comments

01:48:39.246 --> 01:48:40.046
one thing that's been part

01:48:40.113 --> 01:48:41.414
of the discussion and looking

01:48:41.481 --> 01:48:42.382
this is probably a question

01:48:42.449 --> 01:48:43.283
for even some of the other

01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:47.187
panels but we've identified

01:48:47.254 --> 01:48:48.488
will entanglements where

01:48:48.555 --> 01:48:50.590
there observer and we've been

01:48:50.657 --> 01:48:53.226
trying to get here labels are

01:48:53.293 --> 01:48:56.196
we able to identify or track

01:48:56.263 --> 01:48:57.464
back to where the table that's

01:48:57.530 --> 01:49:00.367
happened with any certainty

01:49:00.433 --> 01:49:02.035
or are we really just looking

01:49:02.102 --> 01:49:03.436
at where we observe it and

01:49:03.503 --> 01:49:05.472
try and rescue that way out

01:49:05.538 --> 01:49:07.040
there and so because if we can

01:49:07.107 --> 01:49:08.008
build a correlation of there's

01:49:08.074 --> 01:49:10.076
more that we need to do to to

01:49:10.143 --> 01:49:11.211
better understand where the

01:49:11.278 --> 01:49:12.479
tanks are actually happening

01:49:12.545 --> 01:49:13.680
not just where there observe

01:49:13.747 --> 01:49:14.748
because that could be quite

01:49:14.814 --> 01:49:15.882
some distance in quite some

01:49:15.949 --> 01:49:17.417
time it's up with something we

01:49:17.484 --> 01:49:19.252
do on a regular basis is that

01:49:19.319 --> 01:49:20.787
the fisheries tags as soon as

01:49:20.854 --> 01:49:22.188
we know that there's a fishery

01:49:22.255 --> 01:49:24.824
on their -- we notify Lauren

01:49:24.891 --> 01:49:26.593
and Justin was Becky down it

01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:28.695
nor purity and they contact

01:49:28.762 --> 01:49:30.163
the fishermen to see if they

01:49:30.230 --> 01:49:31.431
want to come out and help us

01:49:31.498 --> 01:49:33.500
retrieve their gear and so

01:49:33.566 --> 01:49:35.435
we're able to get information

01:49:35.502 --> 01:49:38.338
on where the gear was set how

01:49:38.405 --> 01:49:39.739
long it has been since the

01:49:39.806 --> 01:49:41.441
will shows up with and tangled

01:49:41.508 --> 01:49:43.877
and and so we can do that for

01:49:43.944 --> 01:49:45.178
the dungeon is crap we can't

01:49:45.245 --> 01:49:46.413
do it for the other fishery

01:49:46.479 --> 01:49:48.448
where we were there's no que

01:49:48.515 --> 01:49:50.617
and something that's going no

01:49:50.684 --> 01:49:51.584
I don't think I've level to

01:49:51.651 --> 01:49:52.886
add but you're exactly correct

01:49:52.953 --> 01:49:54.587
to do it mean the tags do help

01:49:54.654 --> 01:49:57.023
do that and we would be great

01:49:57.090 --> 01:49:59.025
if other types of fisheries

01:49:59.092 --> 01:50:00.260
also had similar types of

01:50:00.327 --> 01:50:01.995
tags we did it again do that

01:50:02.062 --> 01:50:04.331
kind of investigative work as

01:50:04.397 --> 01:50:05.865
you mentioned it just because

01:50:05.932 --> 01:50:07.767
the word cited does not mean

01:50:07.834 --> 01:50:08.868
that's where they entanglement

01:50:08.935 --> 01:50:10.070
encourage and these animals

01:50:10.136 --> 01:50:11.972
can carry this gear around for

01:50:12.038 --> 01:50:14.307
weeks to months a year several

01:50:14.374 --> 01:50:16.309
months -- which confounds thing

01:50:16.376 --> 01:50:18.845
so -- as Peter mentioned folks

01:50:18.912 --> 01:50:20.246
are working on that part of it

01:50:20.313 --> 01:50:21.781
-- trying to assemble enough

01:50:21.848 --> 01:50:23.683
for that data together from

01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:24.951
the disentangle months we've

01:50:25.018 --> 01:50:26.886
had but it'll it'll take some

01:50:26.953 --> 01:50:28.655
time that the the data we don't

01:50:28.722 --> 01:50:30.824
have that much data yet because

01:50:30.890 --> 01:50:31.925
there are things it seems to be

01:50:31.992 --> 01:50:34.227
key to all of this is is real

01:50:34.294 --> 01:50:35.495
data and be able to collect

01:50:35.562 --> 01:50:37.163
the data and reliable data

01:50:37.230 --> 01:50:40.266
of not just where the wealthy

01:50:40.333 --> 01:50:41.568
take a well with a counter but

01:50:41.634 --> 01:50:43.536
but we're eating county year

01:50:43.603 --> 01:50:44.704
to better understand some of

01:50:44.771 --> 01:50:46.639
those patterns and relations

01:50:46.706 --> 01:50:48.108
and we are getting cooperation

01:50:48.174 --> 01:50:50.143
with the organ fisheries --

01:50:50.210 --> 01:50:51.311
the most recent disentangle

01:50:51.378 --> 01:50:53.046
when I did was with an organ

01:50:53.113 --> 01:50:54.647
tagged with brought down to

01:50:54.714 --> 01:50:57.584
-- -- -- Monterey Bay from

01:50:57.650 --> 01:50:59.853
Oregon because I can understand

01:50:59.919 --> 01:51:02.155
why they're identified in the

01:51:02.222 --> 01:51:03.356
Monterey Bay with the about a

01:51:03.423 --> 01:51:04.624
well watching and both center

01:51:04.691 --> 01:51:05.825
out there they can see them

01:51:05.892 --> 01:51:07.994
more often last further up

01:51:08.061 --> 01:51:09.229
the coast but that's not where

01:51:09.295 --> 01:51:12.365
they're being taken okay if we

01:51:12.432 --> 01:51:14.601
can better build relationships

01:51:14.667 --> 01:51:16.102
with our neighbors to the

01:51:16.169 --> 01:51:17.737
north and figure out how we

01:51:17.804 --> 01:51:20.974
can get more types of fisheries

01:51:21.041 --> 01:51:22.175
indicated at least figure out

01:51:22.242 --> 01:51:23.643
where they are coming from

01:51:23.710 --> 01:51:25.078
but I would think help without

01:51:25.145 --> 01:51:26.713
in that there's another issue

01:51:26.780 --> 01:51:27.714
in that regard that we're

01:51:27.781 --> 01:51:29.682
starting year as how long does

01:51:29.749 --> 01:51:31.451
it take for a certain level

01:51:31.518 --> 01:51:33.987
of -- injury to happen on the

01:51:34.054 --> 01:51:35.555
way I'll so in other words

01:51:35.622 --> 01:51:38.658
we may find a entertainment

01:51:38.725 --> 01:51:42.195
that was actually encountered

01:51:42.262 --> 01:51:43.730
a month possibly two months

01:51:43.797 --> 01:51:45.365
earlier which which and then

01:51:45.432 --> 01:51:47.467
kind of changes your monthly

01:51:47.534 --> 01:51:49.269
distribution of the commonality

01:51:49.335 --> 01:51:51.638
of -- of entanglements and so

01:51:51.704 --> 01:51:53.139
if if he throws a little bit

01:51:53.206 --> 01:51:54.474
of a monkey wrench into having

01:51:54.541 --> 01:51:56.910
a real fine data set but --

01:51:56.976 --> 01:51:58.278
if we can identify different

01:51:58.344 --> 01:51:59.879
animals been injured for six

01:51:59.946 --> 01:52:01.915
weeks the and it came down from

01:52:01.981 --> 01:52:03.817
Oregon we know that it doesn't

01:52:03.883 --> 01:52:05.685
impact the California --

01:52:05.752 --> 01:52:07.287
dungeons crab fishery in terms

01:52:07.353 --> 01:52:10.023
of a statistic of an entangled

01:52:10.090 --> 01:52:11.691
so better job with research

01:52:11.758 --> 01:52:12.859
and that's again I think an

01:52:12.926 --> 01:52:14.828
appropriate role for the state

01:52:14.894 --> 01:52:15.995
is to figure out how we can

01:52:16.062 --> 01:52:17.730
facilitate with some of that

01:52:17.797 --> 01:52:19.265
research but then also working

01:52:19.332 --> 01:52:20.700
with the industries that

01:52:20.767 --> 01:52:23.103
bigger better able to identify

01:52:23.169 --> 01:52:25.271
which here where and and how

01:52:25.338 --> 01:52:26.573
that moves as we understand

01:52:26.639 --> 01:52:29.809
what the well to some

01:52:29.876 --> 01:52:32.779
thank you

01:52:32.846 --> 01:52:33.680
thank you so much was vice

01:52:33.746 --> 01:52:35.815
chair just a few questions and

01:52:35.882 --> 01:52:39.986
building upon -- the vice chair

01:52:40.053 --> 01:52:41.287
what would you say when you

01:52:41.354 --> 01:52:42.455
come across a well it's been

01:52:42.522 --> 01:52:44.090
a table and I know that some

01:52:44.157 --> 01:52:45.992
this is guessing are you

01:52:46.059 --> 01:52:47.127
thinking that that will have

01:52:47.193 --> 01:52:49.529
been integral for weeks -- in

01:52:49.596 --> 01:52:50.897
this is made ongoing problem

01:52:50.964 --> 01:52:52.765
maturity rainy season what

01:52:52.832 --> 01:52:54.434
do you all see on the ground

01:52:54.501 --> 01:52:55.802
or what is your guide -- from

01:52:55.869 --> 01:52:58.004
taking a look at -- majority

01:52:58.071 --> 01:53:00.540
of cases week we've seen

01:53:00.607 --> 01:53:03.676
-- an animal in which the

01:53:03.743 --> 01:53:05.678
entanglement was observer and

01:53:05.745 --> 01:53:07.046
our response was six hours

01:53:07.113 --> 01:53:09.349
later we also have a situation

01:53:09.415 --> 01:53:11.017
where we know one animal was

01:53:11.084 --> 01:53:13.786
entangled on October first and

01:53:13.853 --> 01:53:15.955
was disentangled on October

01:53:16.022 --> 01:53:17.290
twenty eight and so we have a

01:53:17.357 --> 01:53:19.325
sense of the level of damage

01:53:19.392 --> 01:53:22.228
-- it in general we don't

01:53:22.295 --> 01:53:23.630
see the entanglements and

01:53:23.696 --> 01:53:25.598
tell their on for at least

01:53:25.665 --> 01:53:28.001
a week or so -- but when we

01:53:28.067 --> 01:53:30.203
start to see -- diminish tell

01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:31.471
they've been on for three

01:53:31.538 --> 01:53:33.573
three to six weeks has the

01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:36.276
public become more aware

01:53:36.342 --> 01:53:38.311
yeah yeah yeah absolutely

01:53:38.378 --> 01:53:39.345
the public has become more

01:53:39.412 --> 01:53:40.580
aware and as you know well

01:53:40.647 --> 01:53:42.649
watching is a growth industry

01:53:42.715 --> 01:53:43.917
-- and a lot more people in

01:53:43.983 --> 01:53:45.618
the water and that they are

01:53:45.685 --> 01:53:46.986
also becoming more aware on

01:53:47.053 --> 01:53:50.390
how to report these things

01:53:50.456 --> 01:53:51.357
we can add one other dot

01:53:51.424 --> 01:53:53.560
quick note that -- when this

01:53:53.626 --> 01:53:55.061
was published it was first

01:53:55.128 --> 01:53:56.829
distributed Monterey and as

01:53:56.896 --> 01:53:58.565
soon as this was distributed

01:53:58.631 --> 01:53:59.699
the number of reports of

01:53:59.766 --> 01:54:01.167
intangible wealth went up by

01:54:01.234 --> 01:54:03.870
an order of magnitude to talk

01:54:03.937 --> 01:54:05.638
about the -- in the numbers the

01:54:05.705 --> 01:54:07.407
numbers and going down since

01:54:07.473 --> 01:54:08.708
the peak year two thousand

01:54:08.775 --> 01:54:13.413
fifteen connecting to your --

01:54:13.479 --> 01:54:14.981
the city sixty shows why should

01:54:15.048 --> 01:54:16.349
check seventy two just a bit

01:54:16.416 --> 01:54:18.484
but Chiu believe it's because

01:54:18.551 --> 01:54:19.519
of the efforts that's been

01:54:19.586 --> 01:54:22.255
happening in regards to please

01:54:22.322 --> 01:54:23.156
originally came to us and

01:54:23.223 --> 01:54:24.123
said we needed to be a to do

01:54:24.190 --> 01:54:25.091
something about it which I've

01:54:25.158 --> 01:54:26.526
never seen industry do before

01:54:26.593 --> 01:54:29.262
right say if we don't fix this

01:54:29.329 --> 01:54:31.331
we will be around right now and

01:54:31.397 --> 01:54:33.333
we have to be able to -- come

01:54:33.399 --> 01:54:36.269
up with some long term solution

01:54:36.336 --> 01:54:38.037
since then we've seen that --

01:54:38.104 --> 01:54:39.305
decreasing entanglements I'd

01:54:39.372 --> 01:54:40.473
like to go to get that what

01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:41.441
you're seeing on the ground if

01:54:41.507 --> 01:54:42.942
you believe that the efforts

01:54:43.009 --> 01:54:43.943
that have been happening here

01:54:44.010 --> 01:54:46.079
in the state have been working

01:54:46.145 --> 01:54:47.747
I think the information you're

01:54:47.814 --> 01:54:49.616
gonna get from -- Jerod a

01:54:49.682 --> 01:54:51.484
little later on that his study

01:54:51.551 --> 01:54:53.186
of of the ocean cycles and

01:54:53.253 --> 01:54:54.754
climb in the ocean I think

01:54:54.821 --> 01:54:59.192
is a stronger -- influence of

01:54:59.259 --> 01:55:00.927
the incidence of entanglements

01:55:00.994 --> 01:55:02.895
-- rather than anything that

01:55:02.962 --> 01:55:04.564
we are actively doing I mean

01:55:04.631 --> 01:55:05.632
we're essentially farm and

01:55:05.698 --> 01:55:06.532
we go out there and put out

01:55:06.599 --> 01:55:08.935
the fire but -- proactively

01:55:09.002 --> 01:55:10.503
though so you you think I I

01:55:10.570 --> 01:55:11.537
get it so you when you say

01:55:11.604 --> 01:55:12.572
that they can two thousand

01:55:12.639 --> 01:55:14.007
fifteen we saw the blob and

01:55:14.073 --> 01:55:16.409
it was very warm in the ocean

01:55:16.476 --> 01:55:18.578
-- airplane traps where --

01:55:18.645 --> 01:55:20.313
the creel in angel beats for

01:55:20.380 --> 01:55:22.615
-- all that that's why we saw

01:55:22.682 --> 01:55:24.083
the increase in because we've

01:55:24.150 --> 01:55:26.019
seen a cooler ocean since two

01:55:26.085 --> 01:55:27.020
thousand fifteen that's why

01:55:27.086 --> 01:55:29.122
we seen a decrease in in in

01:55:29.188 --> 01:55:30.923
in the big influence I believe

01:55:30.990 --> 01:55:32.558
is that year when they had

01:55:32.625 --> 01:55:34.394
the big delay yeah there was

01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:36.529
what -- Jim Anderson says was

01:55:36.596 --> 01:55:38.498
a derby mentality for there's

01:55:38.564 --> 01:55:39.799
an immense amount of gear that

01:55:39.866 --> 01:55:41.901
was put in got it and a lot of

01:55:41.968 --> 01:55:43.503
people from out of state put in

01:55:43.569 --> 01:55:46.105
-- nine hundred feline in two

01:55:46.172 --> 01:55:47.974
hundred feet of water and bingo

01:55:48.041 --> 01:55:51.077
tell -- cam it's kind of I can

01:55:51.144 --> 01:55:52.145
speak to that a little bit to

01:55:52.211 --> 01:55:54.881
get go head -- so a couple of

01:55:54.947 --> 01:55:57.684
things we can only address may

01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:58.951
because that's the only time

01:55:59.018 --> 01:56:00.420
we have data for those a little

01:56:00.486 --> 01:56:02.789
bit later in the season but

01:56:02.855 --> 01:56:04.691
-- what we did find I didn't

01:56:04.757 --> 01:56:06.626
show it in our preliminary

01:56:06.693 --> 01:56:08.628
models is that that that year

01:56:08.695 --> 01:56:09.996
when there was the delayed

01:56:10.063 --> 01:56:11.798
opening of the fishery there

01:56:11.864 --> 01:56:14.000
was definitely a lot more guilt

01:56:14.067 --> 01:56:16.102
here still in the water in may

01:56:16.169 --> 01:56:18.805
and further out offshore so

01:56:18.871 --> 01:56:20.940
that's clearly and issues the

01:56:21.007 --> 01:56:22.675
that sort of the development

01:56:22.742 --> 01:56:24.110
of the fishery three times

01:56:24.177 --> 01:56:27.480
after opening -- those parts

01:56:27.547 --> 01:56:29.615
tend to move off shore as the

01:56:29.682 --> 01:56:31.951
inshore waters get fished out

01:56:32.018 --> 01:56:33.486
-- and that's where the whales

01:56:33.553 --> 01:56:35.722
tend to be occurring the other

01:56:35.788 --> 01:56:36.856
thing that we found with some

01:56:36.923 --> 01:56:38.458
of our data is that whales

01:56:38.524 --> 01:56:40.426
are actually a lot of writing

01:56:40.493 --> 01:56:42.528
earlier to the area and so that

01:56:42.595 --> 01:56:44.797
means that there's more overlap

01:56:44.864 --> 01:56:48.201
tempore early with the fishery

01:56:48.267 --> 01:56:49.969
I'd like to switch gears to --

01:56:50.036 --> 01:56:52.739
fisheries that well spaceship

01:56:52.805 --> 01:56:55.174
strikes by the name when the

01:56:55.241 --> 01:56:56.209
concern that we have is no

01:56:56.275 --> 01:56:58.111
formal tracking the number

01:56:58.177 --> 01:56:59.178
you put up on the screen were

01:56:59.245 --> 01:57:04.050
eighty whales -- in total -- I

01:57:04.117 --> 01:57:06.419
would have been guessing here

01:57:06.486 --> 01:57:08.121
that that's a fraction of what

01:57:08.187 --> 01:57:10.957
we see talk to us about how

01:57:11.023 --> 01:57:13.393
you came up with the eighty --

01:57:13.459 --> 01:57:14.627
because one of the items that

01:57:14.694 --> 01:57:15.661
we are talking about prior to

01:57:15.728 --> 01:57:16.696
this hearing is there is no

01:57:16.763 --> 01:57:18.331
formal track in the last in

01:57:18.398 --> 01:57:19.832
the majors sees it or to self

01:57:19.899 --> 01:57:20.833
report I don't think there's a

01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:22.001
whole lot of self reports out

01:57:22.068 --> 01:57:24.737
there correct -- in so in the

01:57:24.804 --> 01:57:26.339
other question I have is why

01:57:26.406 --> 01:57:28.408
so many fin whales what what

01:57:28.474 --> 01:57:30.777
is that -- with the dynamic

01:57:30.843 --> 01:57:34.280
that you seen yeah -- so there

01:57:34.347 --> 01:57:36.282
the formal tracking is is

01:57:36.349 --> 01:57:38.885
not too dissimilar from the

01:57:38.951 --> 01:57:41.421
entanglement so but of course

01:57:41.487 --> 01:57:44.190
you don't see whales struck

01:57:44.257 --> 01:57:46.259
very often they do come into

01:57:46.325 --> 01:57:47.794
court on the thousand ships so

01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:49.829
that's the that's the analogy

01:57:49.896 --> 01:57:51.697
there -- and then of course

01:57:51.764 --> 01:57:53.466
there's the whale carcasses

01:57:53.533 --> 01:57:54.901
that washed up on shore and a

01:57:54.967 --> 01:57:57.136
necropsy shows that there was

01:57:57.203 --> 01:57:59.439
one for strong so those are

01:57:59.505 --> 01:58:03.009
the two sources of -- definite

01:58:03.075 --> 01:58:05.178
their debts -- number so we

01:58:05.244 --> 01:58:07.313
can find it so are you saying

01:58:07.380 --> 01:58:08.414
that you're correlating those

01:58:08.481 --> 01:58:10.883
eighty two those two scenarios

01:58:10.950 --> 01:58:11.717
that you just mentioned for

01:58:11.784 --> 01:58:14.420
example yeah so so the number

01:58:14.487 --> 01:58:15.655
of wells that washed up on

01:58:15.721 --> 01:58:19.459
shore we can gas or with some

01:58:19.525 --> 01:58:21.294
analogies to difference studies

01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:22.929
have been done on other species

01:58:22.995 --> 01:58:25.598
that are out between less

01:58:25.665 --> 01:58:27.200
than one percent and about

01:58:27.266 --> 01:58:28.568
twenty percent of whatever

01:58:28.634 --> 01:58:30.736
killed make it to shore and

01:58:30.803 --> 01:58:32.872
so -- you can take the numbers

01:58:32.939 --> 01:58:34.841
doesn't counted and multiply

01:58:34.907 --> 01:58:37.977
it by about twenty to get that

01:58:38.044 --> 01:58:38.678
and that's what's so that's

01:58:38.744 --> 01:58:41.214
another way to get out of the

01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:42.582
number will serving collection

01:58:42.648 --> 01:58:46.352
strikes any that is close to

01:58:46.419 --> 01:58:48.387
the numbers that we found in

01:58:48.454 --> 01:58:50.990
our fault so -- so then the

01:58:51.057 --> 01:58:54.494
model is first represent the

01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:57.363
actual number of whales why so

01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:59.866
many fans so fin whales have

01:58:59.932 --> 01:59:01.901
a much larger population and

01:59:01.968 --> 01:59:03.169
there are also distribute a

01:59:03.236 --> 01:59:04.237
little bit for the offshore

01:59:04.303 --> 01:59:06.205
so that may be except for in

01:59:06.272 --> 01:59:07.306
southern California with a

01:59:07.373 --> 01:59:09.876
lot of traffic so so those two

01:59:09.942 --> 01:59:12.812
factors are really within the

01:59:12.879 --> 01:59:14.113
northeast you mentioned speed

01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:15.648
restrictions as well as traffic

01:59:15.715 --> 01:59:18.618
routes -- is this with in state

01:59:18.684 --> 01:59:21.554
waters -- that at these are

01:59:21.621 --> 01:59:23.656
these informal rules talked

01:59:23.723 --> 01:59:25.224
with people go little deeper to

01:59:25.291 --> 01:59:27.260
that yeah so on the east coast

01:59:27.326 --> 01:59:29.662
there's a mix of things there's

01:59:29.729 --> 01:59:30.930
-- where they call seasonal

01:59:30.997 --> 01:59:32.732
management areas where there

01:59:32.798 --> 01:59:35.535
are speeds instituted in the

01:59:35.601 --> 01:59:36.769
time of year when the whales

01:59:36.836 --> 01:59:38.804
are most likely to be present

01:59:38.871 --> 01:59:40.406
-- and those are usually

01:59:40.473 --> 01:59:42.775
established where there are

01:59:42.842 --> 01:59:44.477
known to be high abundances of

01:59:44.544 --> 01:59:45.978
the whales who's overseen the

01:59:46.045 --> 01:59:48.447
rules so that no -- puts those

01:59:48.514 --> 01:59:50.049
rules in place and the Coast

01:59:50.116 --> 01:59:52.618
Guard forces -- -- no -- are

01:59:52.685 --> 01:59:55.354
you has a role in enforcement

01:59:55.421 --> 01:59:58.057
-- and then as far as routing

01:59:58.124 --> 02:00:00.993
of ships generally if we can

02:00:01.060 --> 02:00:02.762
know where the whales tend to

02:00:02.828 --> 02:00:05.464
agree and that's consistent

02:00:05.531 --> 02:00:07.867
year to year that's -- of big

02:00:07.934 --> 02:00:11.103
copy on -- then we can guide

02:00:11.170 --> 02:00:12.638
ship traffic around that and

02:00:12.705 --> 02:00:15.241
that can be within state waters

02:00:15.308 --> 02:00:18.644
so that official ship lanes

02:00:18.711 --> 02:00:20.313
for example here off of San

02:00:20.379 --> 02:00:22.515
Francisco go out just about

02:00:22.582 --> 02:00:24.584
to -- the shelf break which is

02:00:24.650 --> 02:00:26.719
about thirty miles off shore so

02:00:26.786 --> 02:00:27.920
we're looking at some of that

02:00:27.987 --> 02:00:29.055
and bring it in state waters

02:00:29.121 --> 02:00:32.592
and some federal close today

02:00:32.658 --> 02:00:34.226
and you believe you said you

02:00:34.293 --> 02:00:35.294
believe that that has had a

02:00:35.361 --> 02:00:36.963
positive impact is far sure

02:00:37.029 --> 02:00:39.999
wells being -- killed in

02:00:40.066 --> 02:00:42.301
just is it in a bottle Takasu

02:00:42.368 --> 02:00:43.869
walking through that yet note

02:00:43.936 --> 02:00:45.671
that there has been a lot of

02:00:45.738 --> 02:00:47.273
research done on the right

02:00:47.340 --> 02:00:48.407
whales and these guys because

02:00:48.474 --> 02:00:49.842
they are so endangered and

02:00:49.909 --> 02:00:52.011
so the research has shown

02:00:52.078 --> 02:00:53.512
that since those rules were

02:00:53.579 --> 02:00:55.181
instituted there's been

02:00:55.247 --> 02:00:57.550
decreases of -- up to eighty

02:00:57.617 --> 02:00:59.118
percent in terms of the ship

02:00:59.185 --> 02:01:01.821
strikes so it's a major factor

02:01:01.887 --> 02:01:03.856
-- there's a big difference

02:01:03.923 --> 02:01:04.857
in terms of the quality the

02:01:04.924 --> 02:01:06.292
whales there because right

02:01:06.359 --> 02:01:07.893
whales are so coastal and

02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:09.428
they're so well known as a lot

02:01:09.495 --> 02:01:11.063
fewer of them so it becomes

02:01:11.130 --> 02:01:12.198
more challenging here on the

02:01:12.264 --> 02:01:14.333
west coast I think but none

02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:16.302
the less so seven other thing

02:01:16.369 --> 02:01:17.503
too it's important to note is

02:01:17.570 --> 02:01:18.871
that no has been working on

02:01:18.938 --> 02:01:20.973
this issue particularly within

02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:22.241
the shipping lanes here off

02:01:22.308 --> 02:01:24.043
of the because the bay area

02:01:24.110 --> 02:01:25.778
and the Santa Barbara channel

02:01:25.845 --> 02:01:27.213
and they do have voluntary

02:01:27.279 --> 02:01:29.715
speed limit -- and there has

02:01:29.782 --> 02:01:31.417
been some corporation by the

02:01:31.484 --> 02:01:33.653
shipping industry but it's

02:01:33.719 --> 02:01:35.921
moderate compared to the

02:01:35.988 --> 02:01:36.989
corporation seen on the east

02:01:37.056 --> 02:01:38.457
coast where those regulations

02:01:38.524 --> 02:01:40.593
are required in the are there

02:01:40.660 --> 02:01:42.628
any consequences any fines in

02:01:42.695 --> 02:01:44.830
place -- and he's coast on the

02:01:44.897 --> 02:01:46.399
east coast yes yes there are

02:01:46.465 --> 02:01:48.100
fines for shipping companies

02:01:48.167 --> 02:01:49.602
that do not comply with those

02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:51.971
people this is going to add

02:01:52.038 --> 02:01:53.506
that in Alaska other similar

02:01:53.572 --> 02:01:56.609
results -- and in Alaska

02:01:56.676 --> 02:01:57.610
the deal specifically with

02:01:57.677 --> 02:01:58.811
humpbacks which are more common

02:01:58.878 --> 02:02:00.780
out with us so it's with the

02:02:00.846 --> 02:02:02.248
final ask is consistent with

02:02:02.314 --> 02:02:05.051
what he said about this because

02:02:05.117 --> 02:02:06.619
you mentioned -- disaster

02:02:06.686 --> 02:02:07.987
service workers in being able

02:02:08.054 --> 02:02:09.255
that I get that implemented

02:02:09.321 --> 02:02:11.924
for those who are out -- -- in

02:02:11.991 --> 02:02:13.626
the intake on the detailing the

02:02:13.693 --> 02:02:16.128
teams anything else that you

02:02:16.195 --> 02:02:17.930
think we should know prior to

02:02:17.997 --> 02:02:19.465
concluding this panel that the

02:02:19.532 --> 02:02:21.734
all the all of the official --

02:02:21.801 --> 02:02:24.270
responders or actually -- put

02:02:24.336 --> 02:02:26.105
into certain levels depending

02:02:26.172 --> 02:02:27.673
on their experience ability

02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:29.975
and and so on and the --

02:02:30.042 --> 02:02:31.410
functional responded for level

02:02:31.477 --> 02:02:33.579
two three and four of us got

02:02:33.646 --> 02:02:36.015
to level three -- Brian backer

02:02:36.082 --> 02:02:38.384
flow three available for and

02:02:38.451 --> 02:02:40.186
so we are all recognized and

02:02:40.252 --> 02:02:41.821
we are on the national permit

02:02:41.887 --> 02:02:43.989
one eighty seven eighty six

02:02:44.056 --> 02:02:45.658
as recognized isn't paying

02:02:45.725 --> 02:02:47.660
works and so we have a way

02:02:47.727 --> 02:02:50.362
of training evaluating and

02:02:50.429 --> 02:02:52.565
advancing a proper disobeying

02:02:52.631 --> 02:02:54.467
orders respond this is there

02:02:54.533 --> 02:02:56.469
anything else you think you

02:02:56.535 --> 02:02:57.870
may need obviously resources

02:02:57.937 --> 02:03:01.607
what we heard you say is -- --

02:03:01.674 --> 02:03:03.409
the way it was in the on the

02:03:03.476 --> 02:03:05.311
misspell it not listing knows

02:03:05.377 --> 02:03:07.413
who are at a -- a dissenting

02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:08.848
the whales would be to be a

02:03:08.914 --> 02:03:10.549
clean up correct the other

02:03:10.616 --> 02:03:12.718
piece that we heard is -- the

02:03:12.785 --> 02:03:14.954
the disaster service worker a

02:03:15.020 --> 02:03:16.956
decoration anything else before

02:03:17.022 --> 02:03:18.591
we conclude that you think we

02:03:18.657 --> 02:03:20.459
need to be able to know of the

02:03:20.526 --> 02:03:22.361
last two years there's been of

02:03:22.428 --> 02:03:23.929
emergency funds of parks on the

02:03:23.996 --> 02:03:25.364
hundred thousand dollars yeah

02:03:25.431 --> 02:03:28.367
which has greatly -- helped

02:03:28.434 --> 02:03:30.536
our situation hasn't solved it

02:03:30.603 --> 02:03:32.304
but it did provide the ability

02:03:32.371 --> 02:03:34.240
to -- pay for one third of

02:03:34.306 --> 02:03:36.208
the cost of a proper response

02:03:36.275 --> 02:03:38.844
vote for five of the stranding

02:03:38.911 --> 02:03:41.213
network participants and so now

02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:42.815
we have some standardization

02:03:42.882 --> 02:03:44.784
in the state so that Scott can

02:03:44.850 --> 02:03:46.552
go down to Long Beach and have

02:03:46.619 --> 02:03:47.887
the exact same vote that he

02:03:47.953 --> 02:03:50.556
uses up in moss landing and and

02:03:50.623 --> 02:03:52.024
then affected disenchantment

02:03:52.091 --> 02:03:53.626
sort coming coming up with some

02:03:53.692 --> 02:03:55.060
standardization and if we can

02:03:55.127 --> 02:03:57.530
get that as a minimum -- we

02:03:57.596 --> 02:03:59.999
can continue -- advancing what

02:04:00.065 --> 02:04:05.137
we're doing thank you semester

02:04:05.204 --> 02:04:06.071

we're not gonna be moving on

02:04:11.844 --> 02:04:13.946
-- with our hearing to our

02:04:14.013 --> 02:04:15.414
second last panel this one is

02:04:15.481 --> 02:04:18.417
-- really going deeper on the

02:04:18.484 --> 02:04:20.152
issues in actions that have

02:04:20.219 --> 02:04:21.320
been made across the state

02:04:21.387 --> 02:04:23.289
to reduce risks of well table

02:04:23.355 --> 02:04:24.890

02:05:23.415 --> 02:05:24.516
which I will refer to as the

02:05:24.583 --> 02:05:25.885
working group throughout I

02:05:25.951 --> 02:05:26.752
just want to acknowledge has

02:05:26.819 --> 02:05:27.653
been some really wonderful

02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:29.188
comments already made about

02:05:29.255 --> 02:05:30.256
the working group's effort so I

02:05:30.322 --> 02:05:31.957
will try to not duplicate what

02:05:32.024 --> 02:05:33.626
has been said but hopefully

02:05:33.692 --> 02:05:36.428
further enhance I'm so we

02:05:36.495 --> 02:05:38.097
certainly want to thank the

02:05:38.163 --> 02:05:39.298
drink twenty for having here

today thank you so much on

02:05:40.766 --> 02:05:42.067
behalf of the working group

02:05:42.134 --> 02:05:44.069
so in September twenty fifteen

02:05:44.136 --> 02:05:45.237
since been shared that the

02:05:45.304 --> 02:05:46.438
department of fish and wildlife

02:05:46.505 --> 02:05:48.040
in partnership with names and

02:05:48.107 --> 02:05:50.843
-- PC a convene -- a working

02:05:50.910 --> 02:05:52.044
group to identify and be

02:05:52.111 --> 02:05:53.579
responsive to this elevated

02:05:53.646 --> 02:05:55.648
risk at elevated levels of

02:05:55.714 --> 02:05:57.216
-- intake of at risk and

02:05:57.283 --> 02:05:58.417
entanglements into just cried

02:05:58.484 --> 02:06:00.052
fishing here and I won't go

02:06:00.119 --> 02:06:01.287
into the composition of the

02:06:01.353 --> 02:06:02.288
working group has been talked

02:06:02.354 --> 02:06:03.389
about a lot but I think that

02:06:03.455 --> 02:06:05.157
in addition to this diverse

02:06:05.224 --> 02:06:06.392
group of stakeholders to come

02:06:06.458 --> 02:06:07.860
together it's also important

02:06:07.927 --> 02:06:08.861
to acknowledge that they're

02:06:08.928 --> 02:06:10.896
surrounded by scientists

02:06:10.963 --> 02:06:12.231
and such as doctor your ten

02:06:12.298 --> 02:06:14.400
Torah legislative can I stop

02:06:14.466 --> 02:06:16.068
consultants such as Tom west

02:06:16.135 --> 02:06:17.870
low -- and others in the room

02:06:17.937 --> 02:06:20.072
including Peter full cans who

02:06:20.139 --> 02:06:21.907
act as advisers to the working

02:06:21.974 --> 02:06:22.908
group to help supplement

02:06:22.975 --> 02:06:25.044
their efforts the group is

02:06:25.110 --> 02:06:26.145
committed as we've talked

02:06:26.211 --> 02:06:28.147
about to identifying solutions

02:06:28.213 --> 02:06:29.548
that support thriving we'll

02:06:29.615 --> 02:06:31.317
populations and other marine

02:06:31.383 --> 02:06:33.218
life along the west coast

02:06:33.285 --> 02:06:34.386
in a thriving unprofitable

02:06:34.453 --> 02:06:36.188
dungeons crab fishery and has

02:06:36.255 --> 02:06:38.023
identified a number priority

02:06:38.090 --> 02:06:39.758
areas to center their efforts

02:06:39.825 --> 02:06:41.327
including improving available

02:06:41.393 --> 02:06:43.762
data gathering and reporting

02:06:43.829 --> 02:06:45.631
exploring gear modifications

02:06:45.698 --> 02:06:46.699
and other technological

02:06:46.765 --> 02:06:48.701
innovations and also our region

02:06:48.767 --> 02:06:50.035
communications to the industry

02:06:50.102 --> 02:06:52.338
and others as has also been

02:06:52.404 --> 02:06:54.039
discussed -- in may twenty

02:06:54.106 --> 02:06:56.141
seventeen there group started

02:06:56.208 --> 02:06:57.576
to develop and produce a

02:06:57.643 --> 02:06:59.845
process to identify and assess

02:06:59.912 --> 02:07:01.547
elevated levels of entanglement

02:07:01.613 --> 02:07:03.015
risk to determine the need for

02:07:03.082 --> 02:07:05.017
management options to reduce

02:07:05.084 --> 02:07:06.719
risk of entanglements and that

02:07:06.785 --> 02:07:08.187
is that risk insights and risk

02:07:08.253 --> 02:07:09.254
assessment and mitigate and

02:07:09.321 --> 02:07:11.523
program the ramp and we have

02:07:11.590 --> 02:07:13.025
doctors in as interim Mister

02:07:13.092 --> 02:07:14.293
master who be speaking more

02:07:14.360 --> 02:07:15.527
about the details of the ramps

02:07:15.594 --> 02:07:16.795
I won't go into for a lot

02:07:16.862 --> 02:07:18.297
of that but there are these

02:07:18.364 --> 02:07:19.798
conditions are factors that

02:07:19.865 --> 02:07:21.433
the working group focuses on

02:07:21.500 --> 02:07:23.836
such as borage distribution

02:07:23.902 --> 02:07:25.871
oceanographic conditions --

02:07:25.938 --> 02:07:27.206
distribution in concentration

02:07:27.272 --> 02:07:28.707
of whales and things like

02:07:28.774 --> 02:07:30.642
season delays to understand

02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:32.745
how that informs the relative

02:07:32.811 --> 02:07:34.146
level of risk of foreign ting

02:07:34.213 --> 02:07:36.915
commence the lessons learned

02:07:36.982 --> 02:07:38.684
-- or maybe I'll to say first

02:07:38.751 --> 02:07:39.818
that for the working group

02:07:39.885 --> 02:07:42.087
to be effective it requires

02:07:42.154 --> 02:07:43.789
consistent reliable and

02:07:43.856 --> 02:07:45.324
standardized informations

02:07:45.391 --> 02:07:46.258
we've been talking a lot

02:07:46.325 --> 02:07:47.559
about the data that needs to

02:07:47.626 --> 02:07:49.128
be available to help inform

02:07:49.194 --> 02:07:50.829
on the ramp in this effort

02:07:50.896 --> 02:07:51.964
the working group supports

02:07:52.031 --> 02:07:53.032
and is involved in a number

02:07:53.098 --> 02:07:54.133
of collaborative research

02:07:54.199 --> 02:07:55.534
projects to help inform the

02:07:55.601 --> 02:07:58.003
ramp including aerial surveys

02:07:58.070 --> 02:08:00.406
solo longer pilot testing gear

02:08:00.472 --> 02:08:02.341
modifications and innovations

02:08:02.408 --> 02:08:03.542
and developing bass fishing

02:08:03.609 --> 02:08:05.377
practices and Jeff Chester

02:08:05.444 --> 02:08:06.678
and Dick Aug who are working

02:08:06.745 --> 02:08:07.613
group participants here on

02:08:07.679 --> 02:08:08.914
the panel I will be sharing

02:08:08.981 --> 02:08:10.249
updates and their perspectives

02:08:10.315 --> 02:08:11.650
on these projects in just a

02:08:11.717 --> 02:08:13.752
moment this is learned from

02:08:13.819 --> 02:08:15.154
the twenty seventeen eighteen

02:08:15.220 --> 02:08:17.189
eighteen ramp pilot were at

02:08:17.256 --> 02:08:18.791
fault evaluated by the working

02:08:18.857 --> 02:08:20.626
group and the twenty eighteen

02:08:20.692 --> 02:08:22.428
nineteen ramp reflects those

02:08:22.494 --> 02:08:24.296
updates -- and the working

02:08:24.363 --> 02:08:26.765
group welcomes feedback on the

02:08:26.832 --> 02:08:28.734
ramp including how to better

02:08:28.801 --> 02:08:30.736
assess risk considerations for

02:08:30.803 --> 02:08:32.271
possible management measures

02:08:32.337 --> 02:08:34.239
and suggestions related to new

02:08:34.306 --> 02:08:36.408
technologies and information

02:08:36.475 --> 02:08:38.644
learned by of your during

02:08:38.710 --> 02:08:39.878
the twenty eighteen nineteen

02:08:39.945 --> 02:08:40.913
ramp will be shared with

02:08:40.979 --> 02:08:42.381
this committee in addition

02:08:42.448 --> 02:08:44.349
to the department names OPC

02:08:44.416 --> 02:08:45.451
the fish and game commission

02:08:45.517 --> 02:08:46.652
into the California dungeons

02:08:46.718 --> 02:08:48.153
crap task force as that's

02:08:48.220 --> 02:08:50.556
available to just very briefly

02:08:50.622 --> 02:08:51.957
on the working group is deeply

02:08:52.024 --> 02:08:53.725
appreciative of the legislature

02:08:53.792 --> 02:08:55.427
for allocating seven and a half

02:08:55.494 --> 02:08:56.495
million dollars at the general

02:08:56.562 --> 02:08:59.064
fund to the OPC to address

02:08:59.131 --> 02:09:00.332
the issue of will internal

02:09:00.399 --> 02:09:01.834
in tangle men and Jeff we

02:09:01.900 --> 02:09:03.168
sharing a few highlights on the

02:09:03.235 --> 02:09:04.470
working group's twenty eighteen

02:09:04.536 --> 02:09:06.071
nineteen recommendations

02:09:06.138 --> 02:09:07.706
which included unanimous or

02:09:07.773 --> 02:09:09.975
unanimous request for the OPC

02:09:10.042 --> 02:09:11.977
to allocate general finds --

02:09:12.044 --> 02:09:14.413
funding for the ramp operations

02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:15.481
-- we've heard that one of

02:09:15.547 --> 02:09:17.116
those projects has been awarded

02:09:17.182 --> 02:09:18.417
which is wonderful and thank

02:09:18.484 --> 02:09:21.453
you and that in that memo that

02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:22.988
includes those recommendations

02:09:23.055 --> 02:09:23.989
was submitted to the joint

02:09:24.056 --> 02:09:24.756
committee on fisheries and

02:09:24.823 --> 02:09:27.025
aquaculture in October are

02:09:27.092 --> 02:09:27.793
the working group would like

02:09:27.860 --> 02:09:29.094
to think senator McGuire

02:09:29.161 --> 02:09:30.529
free support in developing

02:09:30.596 --> 02:09:31.864
Senate bill thirteen oh nine

02:09:31.930 --> 02:09:32.965
which included a number of

02:09:33.031 --> 02:09:34.233
recommendations made by the

02:09:34.299 --> 02:09:36.101
working group -- in the during

02:09:36.168 --> 02:09:37.402
the twenty seventeen eighteen

02:09:37.469 --> 02:09:40.239
season and one that the --

02:09:40.305 --> 02:09:41.373
maybe important to highlight

02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:43.008
as was just mentioned recently

02:09:43.075 --> 02:09:44.710
one is requiring standardized

02:09:44.776 --> 02:09:46.478
cure marking to be implemented

02:09:46.545 --> 02:09:48.680
by January first twenty twenty

02:09:48.747 --> 02:09:49.915
which the department will work

02:09:49.982 --> 02:09:51.617
with other fisheries are is the

02:09:51.683 --> 02:09:53.418
intention to help address the

02:09:53.485 --> 02:09:54.953
significant number of unknown

02:09:55.020 --> 02:09:56.388
cure types of this conversation

02:09:56.455 --> 02:09:57.890
around here markings and

02:09:57.956 --> 02:09:59.458
then also as was discussed

02:09:59.525 --> 02:10:00.392
permitting the director of

02:10:00.459 --> 02:10:01.727

twenty nineteen to respond in

02:10:05.297 --> 02:10:06.431
consultation with the working

02:10:06.498 --> 02:10:07.766
group to circumstances at

02:10:07.833 --> 02:10:09.668
elevated entanglement rescue

02:10:09.735 --> 02:10:11.036
into teeny to work together

02:10:11.103 --> 02:10:11.770
with the working group the

02:10:11.837 --> 02:10:13.238
department in partnership

02:10:13.305 --> 02:10:14.673
I'm in others to adopt the

02:10:14.740 --> 02:10:16.842
criterion protocol to evaluate

02:10:16.909 --> 02:10:18.110
and response to potential

02:10:18.177 --> 02:10:19.111
entanglement risk moving

02:10:19.178 --> 02:10:21.046
forward to the working group

02:10:21.113 --> 02:10:22.548
I continues to be committed

02:10:22.614 --> 02:10:24.950
to the work -- improper story

02:10:25.017 --> 02:10:25.884
I'm just gonna say one other

02:10:25.951 --> 02:10:27.653
thing qualities on the working

02:10:27.719 --> 02:10:28.654
group would like to also

on including implementing

02:10:34.293 --> 02:10:36.728
commonsense year surface gear

02:10:36.795 --> 02:10:38.797

for the twenty eighteen

02:10:39.698 --> 02:10:40.832
nineteen season which again was

02:10:40.899 --> 02:10:43.969
mentioned -- and and beyond the

02:10:44.036 --> 02:10:45.170
twenty eighteen nineteen season

02:10:45.237 --> 02:10:46.705
to reduce potential integument

02:10:46.772 --> 02:10:48.440
hazards and the working group

02:10:48.507 --> 02:10:50.209
values to direct communication

doctors in Torrance associate

02:11:28.647 --> 02:11:29.781
researcher for the user in

02:11:29.848 --> 02:11:31.883
receipt California -- he's

02:11:31.950 --> 02:11:33.151
gonna be providing really that

02:11:33.218 --> 02:11:35.854
ecosystem perspective on --

02:11:35.921 --> 02:11:37.990
Ocean Klein made creel all the

02:11:38.056 --> 02:11:40.492
forge fish issues -- as well

02:11:40.559 --> 02:11:42.461
as potential risks for and --

02:11:42.527 --> 02:11:44.529
entanglement in -- doctor I

02:11:44.596 --> 02:11:47.332
mean idea also look at warm

02:11:47.399 --> 02:11:49.034
water conditions in why that

02:11:49.101 --> 02:11:50.836
is being so troublesome out

02:11:50.902 --> 02:11:52.037
over the last three years as

02:11:52.104 --> 02:11:53.171
well I'm sure you can include

02:11:53.238 --> 02:11:54.373
that in the presentation but

02:11:54.439 --> 02:11:56.074
if you work you can just add

02:11:56.141 --> 02:11:57.142
that to the presentation of

02:11:57.209 --> 02:11:58.443
five minutes Sir it's good to

02:11:58.510 --> 02:11:59.278
see you thank you so much for

02:11:59.344 --> 02:12:00.612
being here thank you chair for

02:12:00.679 --> 02:12:07.653
inviting me to speak to the

02:12:07.719 --> 02:12:11.356
all right

02:12:11.423 --> 02:12:12.557
Hey that's exactly

02:12:12.624 --> 02:12:17.462
of their ego alright

02:12:17.529 --> 02:12:19.431
okay -- my name is Jared sense

02:12:19.498 --> 02:12:21.333
or a hat and I'm a social

02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:22.501
researcher the university of

02:12:22.567 --> 02:12:24.603
California Santa Cruz and I

02:12:24.670 --> 02:12:26.838
study ecosystem dynamics --

02:12:26.905 --> 02:12:28.307
Friday different ecosystems

02:12:28.373 --> 02:12:30.709
and when the I'd like to make

02:12:30.776 --> 02:12:32.377
clear today is that we we need

02:12:32.444 --> 02:12:33.512
to make a clear distinction

02:12:33.578 --> 02:12:35.247
between indicators like

02:12:35.314 --> 02:12:36.815
demo gas and or see service

02:12:36.882 --> 02:12:38.083
temperature those indicators

02:12:38.150 --> 02:12:39.351
are symptoms of an on health

02:12:39.418 --> 02:12:42.354
and environment but it's key

02:12:42.421 --> 02:12:43.689
to understanding all this is

02:12:43.755 --> 02:12:46.191
to examine the processing is on

02:12:46.258 --> 02:12:47.926
there underlying these events

02:12:47.993 --> 02:12:49.027
and so that's where I've been

02:12:49.094 --> 02:12:51.263
focusing on the last few years

02:12:51.330 --> 02:12:52.497
-- I think it's important to

02:12:52.564 --> 02:12:53.565
just read live some of this

02:12:53.632 --> 02:12:55.567
history because it might --

02:12:55.634 --> 02:12:56.535
we might be going through it

02:12:56.601 --> 02:12:58.537
again sometime in the future

02:12:58.603 --> 02:12:59.838
-- but I was brought on to the

02:12:59.905 --> 02:13:01.306
the working group as scientific

02:13:01.373 --> 02:13:02.708
adviser in two thousand and

02:13:02.774 --> 02:13:04.943
seventeen which I spend so you

02:13:05.010 --> 02:13:06.278
know a good good man of the

02:13:06.345 --> 02:13:08.880
year developing a synthesis

02:13:08.947 --> 02:13:10.649
-- that on this two thousand

02:13:10.716 --> 02:13:12.317
fifteen sixteen entitlement

02:13:12.384 --> 02:13:14.219
issue and it's a hypothesis

02:13:14.286 --> 02:13:15.420
as want to be clear about that

02:13:15.487 --> 02:13:16.521
and one thing I haven't heard

02:13:16.588 --> 02:13:17.889
today is that one thing that's

02:13:17.956 --> 02:13:18.957
key to this is that there's

02:13:19.024 --> 02:13:20.992
been a long term increase and

02:13:21.059 --> 02:13:22.861
well one of the populations

02:13:22.928 --> 02:13:24.363
are recovering combined wells

02:13:24.429 --> 02:13:26.698
are recall -- the second

02:13:26.765 --> 02:13:28.266
component of the hypothesis

02:13:28.333 --> 02:13:29.735
is about the large marine heat

02:13:29.801 --> 02:13:31.036
wave that we experience also

02:13:31.103 --> 02:13:33.238
known as the blog what that did

02:13:33.305 --> 02:13:35.607
was intro habitat compression

02:13:35.674 --> 02:13:37.209
warm water encroaches upon our

02:13:37.275 --> 02:13:39.010
coast and there was still good

02:13:39.077 --> 02:13:40.345
up Welling in twenty fifteen

02:13:40.412 --> 02:13:41.713
twenty sixteen it was just

02:13:41.780 --> 02:13:43.115
very minimal compared to the

02:13:43.181 --> 02:13:44.916
past we had good up well and

02:13:44.983 --> 02:13:46.852
was very very restricted along

02:13:46.918 --> 02:13:49.054
the coast on that for system

02:13:49.121 --> 02:13:51.990
he heatwave -- correlated

02:13:52.057 --> 02:13:53.158
with the of the prevalence

02:13:53.225 --> 02:13:54.159
of persistence of tomorrow

02:13:54.226 --> 02:13:55.460
okay acid that we know about

02:13:55.527 --> 02:13:57.028
and it also resulted in the

02:13:57.095 --> 02:13:59.498
confines of creel populations

02:13:59.564 --> 02:14:02.067
and -- there was basically no

02:14:02.134 --> 02:14:03.668
food in town for the wells it

02:14:03.735 --> 02:14:05.170
gives me great pleasure when I

02:14:05.237 --> 02:14:06.738
hear about directors everyone

02:14:06.805 --> 02:14:07.973
produce my Ste the said the

02:14:08.039 --> 02:14:09.775
system down to a few soundbites

02:14:09.841 --> 02:14:11.209
that means I've got my message

02:14:11.276 --> 02:14:13.211
across the group populations

02:14:13.278 --> 02:14:14.746
tanks and the only food that

02:14:14.813 --> 02:14:16.114
was available was a near shore

02:14:16.181 --> 02:14:18.283
anchovy concentration and

02:14:18.350 --> 02:14:19.384
this is from the perspective

02:14:19.451 --> 02:14:20.585
of a humpback whale they will

02:14:20.652 --> 02:14:22.154
switch over to beating on for

02:14:22.220 --> 02:14:23.622
traditional move ensure where

02:14:23.688 --> 02:14:25.023
there's food available to

02:14:25.090 --> 02:14:26.858
them arms that pre switching

02:14:26.925 --> 02:14:27.859
is a key aspect of their

02:14:27.926 --> 02:14:29.628
behavior and their behavior is

02:14:29.694 --> 02:14:30.729
fundamentally different when

02:14:30.796 --> 02:14:31.630
they're feeding on Carrillo

02:14:31.696 --> 02:14:33.265
versus the feeding on fish

02:14:33.331 --> 02:14:35.700
the more acrobatic and more --

02:14:35.767 --> 02:14:37.669
like Peter showed in his -- is

02:14:37.736 --> 02:14:38.970
some of this video there with

02:14:39.037 --> 02:14:40.205
the Wells twist around a bit

02:14:40.272 --> 02:14:41.706
more than a bit more active

02:14:41.773 --> 02:14:42.607
when they're feeding on fish

02:14:42.674 --> 02:14:43.842
versus creel they can just go

02:14:43.909 --> 02:14:45.277
down deep and then swim through

02:14:45.343 --> 02:14:48.280
across -- but this the third

02:14:48.346 --> 02:14:49.648
component is that this ample

02:14:49.714 --> 02:14:51.049
fight co occurrence as we heard

02:14:51.116 --> 02:14:52.350
earlier all the gear that one

02:14:52.417 --> 02:14:54.186
out due to the fishing delay

02:14:54.252 --> 02:14:56.254
that one out late twenty April

02:14:56.321 --> 02:14:58.590
twenty sixteen result in a lot

02:14:58.657 --> 02:14:59.758
of entanglements but one thing

02:14:59.825 --> 02:15:00.859
I want to make clear is that

02:15:00.926 --> 02:15:02.160
there was just money there is

02:15:02.227 --> 02:15:03.428
nearly as many entanglements

02:15:03.495 --> 02:15:04.663
in twenty fifteen the pres

02:15:04.729 --> 02:15:07.065
the previous season as it was

02:15:07.132 --> 02:15:08.333
during the the the the other

02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:10.168
we had a fishing delay and that

02:15:10.235 --> 02:15:11.536
was because of this habitat

02:15:11.603 --> 02:15:12.671
compression that happened to

02:15:12.737 --> 02:15:15.574
the blog so the end result

02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:16.975
which is consecutive years of

02:15:17.042 --> 02:15:19.010
high tide spacetime overlap

02:15:19.077 --> 02:15:22.814
forging wells and fishing

02:15:22.881 --> 02:15:24.049
our this is a time line that

02:15:24.115 --> 02:15:25.116
I put together that kinda

02:15:25.183 --> 02:15:27.285
illustrates this ecosystem

02:15:27.352 --> 02:15:28.887
perspective as we move from two

02:15:28.954 --> 02:15:30.856
thirteen was which was a record

02:15:30.922 --> 02:15:32.491
phenomenal cold upwelling

02:15:32.557 --> 02:15:34.626
year creel populations were

02:15:34.693 --> 02:15:36.127
plentiful there all the hot

02:15:36.194 --> 02:15:37.629
spots that were available to

02:15:37.696 --> 02:15:39.564
wells were were available and

02:15:39.631 --> 02:15:40.899
then in late twenty fourteen

02:15:40.966 --> 02:15:42.801
the blob starts to can starts

02:15:42.868 --> 02:15:45.070
to develop three that we

02:15:45.136 --> 02:15:46.872
had an el Nino that combined

02:15:46.938 --> 02:15:48.673
with the blob that impacted

02:15:48.740 --> 02:15:50.242
the the whole -- appalling

02:15:50.308 --> 02:15:53.278
ecosystem of California but

02:15:53.345 --> 02:15:54.379
shortly after that after

02:15:54.446 --> 02:15:55.947
twenty sixteen delay what part

02:15:56.014 --> 02:15:57.048
of the reason why you see a

02:15:57.115 --> 02:15:58.517
decline in the entanglements

02:15:58.583 --> 02:16:00.151
that we return to normal cool

02:16:00.218 --> 02:16:01.319
up Welling conditions in the

02:16:01.386 --> 02:16:02.787
creel population started to

02:16:02.854 --> 02:16:04.289
come back principle pray for

02:16:04.356 --> 02:16:06.091
the wells of this kind of

02:16:06.157 --> 02:16:07.092
just walk through some of the

02:16:07.158 --> 02:16:08.627
the key elements of the price

02:16:08.693 --> 02:16:10.195
which behavior in some of the

02:16:10.262 --> 02:16:11.796
the for jobs and conditions

02:16:11.863 --> 02:16:13.498
this synthesis that I that

02:16:13.565 --> 02:16:15.433
I worked up and I presented

02:16:15.500 --> 02:16:17.602
the working group -- enabled

02:16:17.669 --> 02:16:19.437
us to come up with the risk

02:16:19.504 --> 02:16:20.805
assessment mitigation program

02:16:20.872 --> 02:16:22.607
in terms of these different

02:16:22.674 --> 02:16:24.576
season seasonal assessments

02:16:24.643 --> 02:16:25.944
preseason the mid season in

02:16:26.011 --> 02:16:27.345
the late season Kelly had

02:16:27.412 --> 02:16:29.848
mentioned sake will expand on

02:16:29.915 --> 02:16:31.550
one of the key aspects of this

02:16:31.616 --> 02:16:33.385
is this first points a basin

02:16:33.451 --> 02:16:35.053
scale -- some potion climate

02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:37.222
and regional condition drives

02:16:37.289 --> 02:16:38.723
winter and spring time up well

02:16:38.790 --> 02:16:40.292
and we have a lot we are rich

02:16:40.358 --> 02:16:42.093
one time series in California

02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:43.528
thirty over thirty year time

02:16:43.595 --> 02:16:45.697
series that I've I've played on

02:16:45.764 --> 02:16:47.232
heavily to produce the senses

02:16:47.299 --> 02:16:48.867
we know exactly what's going

02:16:48.934 --> 02:16:51.736
to happen in in spring if we

02:16:51.803 --> 02:16:52.837
look at the winter time there's

02:16:52.904 --> 02:16:54.005
a connection there we can make

02:16:54.072 --> 02:16:56.074
predictions going forward --

02:16:56.141 --> 02:16:57.776
so these preseason mid season

02:16:57.842 --> 02:16:59.611
late season components for the

02:16:59.678 --> 02:17:01.279
different aspects of the ocean

02:17:01.346 --> 02:17:02.681
forage community is something

02:17:02.747 --> 02:17:03.815
that we've been we've developed

02:17:03.882 --> 02:17:05.483
and inserted into the ramp

02:17:05.550 --> 02:17:06.851
currently it's unfunded the

02:17:06.918 --> 02:17:08.687
working on on funding not going

02:17:08.753 --> 02:17:10.822
forward -- I just wanna give

02:17:10.889 --> 02:17:13.959
a few of perspectives these

02:17:14.025 --> 02:17:15.060
are my perspectives not the

02:17:15.126 --> 02:17:16.795
working group's perspectives

02:17:16.861 --> 02:17:18.263
in can I I want to commend what

02:17:18.330 --> 02:17:19.264
I've heard in this room about

02:17:19.331 --> 02:17:21.032
the at the state of California

02:17:21.099 --> 02:17:22.100
I think we should be proud

02:17:22.167 --> 02:17:23.435
that we're leading this charge

02:17:23.501 --> 02:17:24.469
against the way on trying

02:17:24.536 --> 02:17:25.804
one issue and and funding

02:17:25.870 --> 02:17:28.607
this working incredible --

02:17:28.673 --> 02:17:30.775
collection of people and this

02:17:30.842 --> 02:17:32.477
is a west coast problem it's

02:17:32.544 --> 02:17:34.412
not strictly California it's

02:17:34.479 --> 02:17:35.947
occurring all over the coast in

02:17:36.014 --> 02:17:37.248
Oregon Washington we're getting

02:17:37.315 --> 02:17:38.984
males earned ten with gear

02:17:39.050 --> 02:17:40.118
from organ washing that are

02:17:40.185 --> 02:17:41.486
showing up in California I've

02:17:41.553 --> 02:17:43.388
switch gears I'm thinking about

02:17:43.455 --> 02:17:44.255
this as a coast Y.

02:17:44.322 --> 02:17:45.624
problem terms of Krillin

02:17:45.690 --> 02:17:47.058
for education oceanographic

02:17:47.125 --> 02:17:49.527
dynamics that's my first point

02:17:49.594 --> 02:17:52.631
-- future entitlement groups

02:17:52.697 --> 02:17:54.065
that are being developed either

02:17:54.132 --> 02:17:55.834
in other states they should

02:17:55.900 --> 02:17:57.335
look at this working group

02:17:57.402 --> 02:18:00.271
and -- big fish commend this

02:18:00.338 --> 02:18:01.706
working group and use it as a

02:18:01.773 --> 02:18:03.708
basis for developing other risk

02:18:03.775 --> 02:18:06.277
assessment programs bringing an

02:18:06.344 --> 02:18:08.079
ecosystem science helps defuse

02:18:08.146 --> 02:18:09.781
roadblocks among stakeholders

02:18:09.848 --> 02:18:11.383
that sets three sets everything

02:18:11.449 --> 02:18:12.617
gives everything a nice common

02:18:12.684 --> 02:18:14.619
ground I want to personally say

02:18:14.686 --> 02:18:16.187
that I feel that the scientific

02:18:16.254 --> 02:18:18.423
community fails to get this

02:18:18.490 --> 02:18:21.626
message out to the stakeholders

02:18:21.693 --> 02:18:22.661
our collection of science as

02:18:22.727 --> 02:18:24.262
we knew we saw the blob we knew

02:18:24.329 --> 02:18:25.397
that we start to see all the

02:18:25.463 --> 02:18:26.765
normal stuff happened we knew

02:18:26.831 --> 02:18:28.333
that compared to previous years

02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:30.201
another el Nino's we knew that

02:18:30.268 --> 02:18:31.870
porridge and krill was going

02:18:31.936 --> 02:18:33.171
to tank but we can get that

02:18:33.238 --> 02:18:35.273
message out the only came down

02:18:35.340 --> 02:18:36.441
to when I met with fishermen

02:18:36.508 --> 02:18:37.909
this because this issue I

02:18:37.976 --> 02:18:39.277
realize how serious it was

02:18:39.344 --> 02:18:41.713
to communicate science so --

02:18:41.780 --> 02:18:43.114
so that third point about the

02:18:43.181 --> 02:18:44.816
science and Fisher engagement

02:18:44.883 --> 02:18:46.051
is absolutely critical for

02:18:46.117 --> 02:18:47.419
minimizing Valentine women's

02:18:47.485 --> 02:18:49.387
in the future -- I personally

02:18:49.454 --> 02:18:50.822
change by chase problems that

02:18:50.889 --> 02:18:52.323
I want to get involved in or I

02:18:52.390 --> 02:18:53.558
choose not to get in problems

02:18:53.625 --> 02:18:55.293
but the methylation ships that

02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:56.728
I built with this working group

02:18:56.795 --> 02:18:58.930
has -- been incredible and

02:18:58.997 --> 02:18:59.998
though the fishermen are key

02:19:00.065 --> 02:19:01.833
observers for whaling forage

02:19:01.900 --> 02:19:03.368
and then under surveyed winter

02:19:03.435 --> 02:19:04.569
season we know very little

02:19:04.636 --> 02:19:05.637
about what's going on during

02:19:05.704 --> 02:19:06.571
the winter when they are out

02:19:06.638 --> 02:19:08.139
there fishing so I just want

02:19:08.206 --> 02:19:09.507
to commend the fishermen on

02:19:09.574 --> 02:19:10.742
this group and the time and

02:19:10.809 --> 02:19:12.043
energy than the communications

02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:15.046
I thought about what to the one

02:19:15.113 --> 02:19:16.715
good one last thing I'd like

02:19:16.781 --> 02:19:18.817
to share is a little bit about

02:19:18.883 --> 02:19:20.785
reach I've been developing

02:19:20.852 --> 02:19:23.021
-- this is a up so this it

02:19:23.088 --> 02:19:24.823
expands and demonstrates how

02:19:24.889 --> 02:19:26.324
this is not just a California

02:19:26.391 --> 02:19:27.559
problem but this is a west

02:19:27.625 --> 02:19:30.095
coast regional problem and this

02:19:30.161 --> 02:19:32.464
is a summary of the ocean and

02:19:32.530 --> 02:19:34.265
forage factors in geographic

02:19:34.332 --> 02:19:36.000
space so we can be digested and

02:19:36.067 --> 02:19:37.335
examined by the public and they

02:19:37.402 --> 02:19:39.337
can see the various -- factors

02:19:39.404 --> 02:19:40.705
in questions that we track

02:19:40.772 --> 02:19:42.674
for ocean foraging conditions

02:19:42.741 --> 02:19:44.008
and really just highlights

02:19:44.075 --> 02:19:47.479
that on very unprecedented --

02:19:47.545 --> 02:19:49.247
ecosystem stress test that we

02:19:49.314 --> 02:19:50.515
went through in twenty fifteen

02:19:50.582 --> 02:19:52.417
and twenty sixteen we can see

02:19:52.484 --> 02:19:53.952
these events coming now since

02:19:54.018 --> 02:19:55.420
we've developed the processes

02:19:55.487 --> 02:19:57.422
underlying them and perhaps

02:19:57.489 --> 02:19:58.790
we might be able to model them

02:19:58.857 --> 02:20:01.659
in the future but you know we

02:20:01.726 --> 02:20:04.262
need more resources to develop

02:20:04.329 --> 02:20:05.897
those syntheses and we need

02:20:05.964 --> 02:20:07.599
to know that the wells in the

02:20:07.665 --> 02:20:08.900
crawl the fortress they don't

02:20:08.967 --> 02:20:10.301
respect the boundaries of the

02:20:10.368 --> 02:20:11.836
of the state of California

02:20:11.903 --> 02:20:13.538
they move throughout this

02:20:13.605 --> 02:20:14.806
entire California current

02:20:14.873 --> 02:20:17.375
large marine ecosystem so

02:20:17.442 --> 02:20:18.710
just wanted to give it up

02:20:18.777 --> 02:20:19.778
that this with this will put

02:20:19.844 --> 02:20:22.514
about reach that we recently

02:20:22.580 --> 02:20:24.349
really nice job thank you very

02:20:24.415 --> 02:20:26.284
much -- a grateful for your

02:20:26.351 --> 02:20:28.286
perspective eight you said that

02:20:28.353 --> 02:20:29.587
that others have been doing

02:20:29.654 --> 02:20:31.356
the NSL but you were able to

02:20:31.422 --> 02:20:32.891
bring that all down the and

02:20:32.957 --> 02:20:34.259
educate out so just once a

02:20:34.325 --> 02:20:35.393
thank you so much for all your

02:20:35.460 --> 02:20:36.928
work looking for work with

02:20:36.995 --> 02:20:38.329
you here as we move forward

02:20:38.396 --> 02:20:39.297
we're not gonna be bringing for

02:20:39.364 --> 02:20:40.598
talking master from the barn a

02:20:40.665 --> 02:20:42.534
program manager -- California

02:20:42.600 --> 02:20:43.968
proposition wildlife he's

02:20:44.035 --> 02:20:45.470
gonna be focusing on the ramp

02:20:45.537 --> 02:20:46.838
process and what the future

02:20:46.905 --> 02:20:49.574
holds -- in really what tools

02:20:49.641 --> 02:20:50.675
we could use better predict

02:20:50.742 --> 02:20:52.610
the risk of entanglement in

02:20:52.677 --> 02:20:54.679
what actually should be taking

02:20:54.746 --> 02:20:56.314
it easy Sir your five minutes

02:20:56.381 --> 02:20:57.515
I thank you good afternoon

02:20:57.582 --> 02:20:59.017
thanks for inviting me and

02:20:59.083 --> 02:21:00.084
thanks for all the panels that

02:21:00.151 --> 02:21:02.020
have helped us explain what

02:21:02.086 --> 02:21:03.788
we think is our path to the

02:21:03.855 --> 02:21:06.324
success and I also I can we

02:21:06.391 --> 02:21:08.092
really want to take advantage

02:21:08.159 --> 02:21:09.194
of the questions I heard

02:21:09.260 --> 02:21:11.396
already today from both occur

02:21:11.462 --> 02:21:12.997
-- senator stone in center

02:21:13.064 --> 02:21:14.265
McGuire which is where do we

02:21:14.332 --> 02:21:16.367
go from here you've heard quite

02:21:16.434 --> 02:21:18.603
a bit about the ramp content

02:21:18.670 --> 02:21:19.938
in terms of membership in the

02:21:20.004 --> 02:21:22.607
basic tools -- but how's it

02:21:22.674 --> 02:21:24.309
actually going to work and what

02:21:24.375 --> 02:21:25.810
do we still need to understand

02:21:25.877 --> 02:21:28.646
so the fundamentals are as

02:21:28.713 --> 02:21:30.381
we need gear that's doesn't

02:21:30.448 --> 02:21:31.950
catch whales that that's a

02:21:32.016 --> 02:21:33.885
goal we don't have that the

02:21:33.952 --> 02:21:35.386
other of course in till that

02:21:35.453 --> 02:21:36.955
happens or if it happens the

02:21:37.021 --> 02:21:38.923
others avoiding co occurrence

02:21:38.990 --> 02:21:41.292
or extreme co currents of gear

02:21:41.359 --> 02:21:43.995
and Wales the good news on the

02:21:44.062 --> 02:21:45.363
gear front we have a lot of

02:21:45.430 --> 02:21:47.365
very smart fishermen scientists

02:21:47.432 --> 02:21:49.133
engineers and biologists

02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:51.769
working on trying to figure out

02:21:51.836 --> 02:21:53.872
here that won't catch while --

02:21:53.938 --> 02:21:55.106
we're not there yet nobody's

02:21:55.173 --> 02:21:57.642
figure that out -- but I will

02:21:57.709 --> 02:22:00.178
say about the gear solution --

02:22:00.245 --> 02:22:01.846
it's easy to technically come

02:22:01.913 --> 02:22:03.114
up with a solution it's a whole

02:22:03.181 --> 02:22:04.182
nother thing to come up with a

02:22:04.249 --> 02:22:06.184
solution that what I say fishes

02:22:06.251 --> 02:22:07.986
eighty it's economically viable

02:22:08.052 --> 02:22:09.988
for the fisherman to use and

02:22:10.054 --> 02:22:11.556
doesn't create other unintended

02:22:11.623 --> 02:22:15.426
consequences so -- it's it's a

02:22:15.493 --> 02:22:18.096
lot harder than it sounds the

02:22:18.162 --> 02:22:19.497
other is a co current you heard

02:22:19.564 --> 02:22:20.932
quite a bit about predicting

02:22:20.999 --> 02:22:22.267
whale behavior but there's

02:22:22.333 --> 02:22:24.035
other half of this that is

02:22:24.102 --> 02:22:25.603
equally as complex and hard

02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:26.971
to get out its understanding

02:22:27.038 --> 02:22:29.507
fishermen their complex group

02:22:29.574 --> 02:22:31.342
we have very many and many

02:22:31.409 --> 02:22:32.777
different business models

02:22:32.844 --> 02:22:34.078
and approaches to risk and

02:22:34.145 --> 02:22:36.547
fishing practices so for us to

02:22:36.614 --> 02:22:38.716
really get this car currents

02:22:38.783 --> 02:22:39.918
we have to spend more time

02:22:39.984 --> 02:22:41.819
understanding our fishermen

02:22:41.886 --> 02:22:43.321
how they make decisions about

02:22:43.388 --> 02:22:44.622
how much gear they face how

02:22:44.689 --> 02:22:46.357
long the fishing where the fish

02:22:46.424 --> 02:22:47.525
and the things that influence

02:22:47.592 --> 02:22:50.395
at price abundance là mÙt

02:22:50.461 --> 02:22:53.097
cast said it sounds obvious

02:22:53.164 --> 02:22:53.965
but one thing I've learned

02:22:54.032 --> 02:22:55.033
working with a fisherman it's

02:22:55.099 --> 02:22:57.168
not obvious cam so we're gonna

02:22:57.235 --> 02:22:58.803
spend a need to spend more time

02:22:58.870 --> 02:23:01.005
really understanding that and

02:23:01.072 --> 02:23:02.340
that's critical not only for

02:23:02.407 --> 02:23:04.809
predicting that undesirable

02:23:04.876 --> 02:23:07.345
coal currency but if we are

02:23:07.412 --> 02:23:08.746
seeing in project in a co

02:23:08.813 --> 02:23:10.181
occurrence what are we actually

02:23:10.248 --> 02:23:11.516
going to do to reduce that

02:23:11.582 --> 02:23:14.452
risk ultimately -- can I tell

02:23:14.519 --> 02:23:15.653
Fishman will just move your

02:23:15.720 --> 02:23:17.055
gear can actually do that how

02:23:17.121 --> 02:23:18.456
much time does it take to move

02:23:18.523 --> 02:23:20.224
back here does it is influenced

02:23:20.291 --> 02:23:21.726
by the size of their operation

02:23:21.793 --> 02:23:23.661
the size their permit a do

02:23:23.728 --> 02:23:24.762
they have to move five hundred

02:23:24.829 --> 02:23:26.998
potter wonder pot does that

02:23:27.065 --> 02:23:28.232
change from beginning the

02:23:28.299 --> 02:23:29.400
season to the end of the scene

02:23:29.467 --> 02:23:31.502
so it's a complex dynamic that

02:23:31.569 --> 02:23:32.971
were only just now starting to

02:23:33.037 --> 02:23:34.939
work on but we will be working

02:23:35.006 --> 02:23:37.308
on a quite a bit getting inside

02:23:37.375 --> 02:23:39.444
their heads and figure out a

02:23:39.510 --> 02:23:41.546
way to really better project

02:23:41.612 --> 02:23:43.314
how they will react both in

02:23:43.381 --> 02:23:45.350
time and space when we have

02:23:45.416 --> 02:23:47.118
a project in the current goal

02:23:47.185 --> 02:23:48.786
currents because if you for

02:23:48.853 --> 02:23:50.655
this ramp to work core the

02:23:50.722 --> 02:23:52.357
ramp is to assess and predict

02:23:52.423 --> 02:23:54.325
a KO currents and then make

02:23:54.392 --> 02:23:55.827
recommendations to the director

02:23:55.893 --> 02:23:57.695
to avoid tobacco currents and

02:23:57.762 --> 02:23:59.630
therefore eliminate or reduce

02:23:59.697 --> 02:24:01.366
the risk of well tangle but we

02:24:01.432 --> 02:24:02.367
have to know how the fishermen

02:24:02.433 --> 02:24:03.935
are going to react the wells

02:24:04.002 --> 02:24:04.902
are gonna do their things

02:24:04.969 --> 02:24:05.970
because last time I talked

02:24:06.037 --> 02:24:07.105
to him they did not listen to

02:24:07.171 --> 02:24:09.107
me at all -- I'm not sure the

02:24:09.173 --> 02:24:10.742
fishermen well but worth that's

02:24:10.808 --> 02:24:12.176
the part we have the best hope

02:24:12.243 --> 02:24:16.014
for -- so to the ramp operation

02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:17.482
as you heard we piloted this

02:24:17.548 --> 02:24:19.584
is our second pilot year were

02:24:19.650 --> 02:24:21.486
work in a voluntary basis

02:24:21.552 --> 02:24:22.954
trying to work the bugs out

02:24:23.021 --> 02:24:24.188
of the system identify the

02:24:24.255 --> 02:24:26.257
weaknesses as I just mentioned

02:24:26.324 --> 02:24:27.558
fishermen behaviors and one of

02:24:27.625 --> 02:24:28.960
the weaknesses we identified

02:24:29.027 --> 02:24:31.696
were working on -- the other of

02:24:31.763 --> 02:24:33.297
course you heard your marking

02:24:33.364 --> 02:24:36.067
-- we'll most of the tangle

02:24:36.134 --> 02:24:37.568
men's that are confirmed an

02:24:37.635 --> 02:24:39.103
identifiable to the fishery

02:24:39.170 --> 02:24:40.338
are to Dungeness crab and

02:24:40.405 --> 02:24:42.206
that's because they're they're

02:24:42.273 --> 02:24:44.675
the most predominant in terms

02:24:44.742 --> 02:24:45.576
of gear but they're also the

02:24:45.643 --> 02:24:48.980
one that's mark -- duty --

02:24:49.047 --> 02:24:50.615
center Maguire's wisdom he

02:24:50.681 --> 02:24:52.116
introduced legislation we will

02:24:52.183 --> 02:24:54.419
be requiring all fixed gear to

02:24:54.485 --> 02:24:56.287
have some unique identifying

02:24:56.354 --> 02:24:58.089
markings so that when we do

02:24:58.156 --> 02:25:00.158
get entanglement we are able

02:25:00.224 --> 02:25:01.459
to trace at least to the

02:25:01.526 --> 02:25:03.261
fishery and so when our source

02:25:03.327 --> 02:25:05.063
solution addresses the actual

02:25:05.129 --> 02:25:07.665
problem and not just a symptom

02:25:07.732 --> 02:25:09.567
that's going to be critical

02:25:09.634 --> 02:25:11.602
-- the other thing we're gonna

02:25:11.669 --> 02:25:13.137
be looking at is improving

02:25:13.204 --> 02:25:14.539
that turn around time on our

02:25:14.605 --> 02:25:18.509
information so -- the agencies

02:25:18.576 --> 02:25:19.777
monitor information that's

02:25:19.844 --> 02:25:20.878
coming in we're developing

02:25:20.945 --> 02:25:22.680
more -- data streams including

02:25:22.747 --> 02:25:24.649
fishermen we started and tested

02:25:24.715 --> 02:25:26.884
last year -- text groups I'm

02:25:26.951 --> 02:25:29.287
not a really technical savvy

02:25:29.353 --> 02:25:30.655
person I'm learning a lot from

02:25:30.721 --> 02:25:32.557
the fishermen where we farm

02:25:32.623 --> 02:25:34.358
groups and they Texas live

02:25:34.425 --> 02:25:35.359
information of what they're

02:25:35.426 --> 02:25:36.627
seeing on the water where

02:25:36.694 --> 02:25:38.129
they're seeing it behavior the

02:25:38.196 --> 02:25:40.164
whales how much gear on the

02:25:40.231 --> 02:25:41.833
way in on the train here this

02:25:41.899 --> 02:25:43.601
morning I got tax from fish

02:25:43.668 --> 02:25:45.136
missing his not much gear here

02:25:45.203 --> 02:25:46.170
that's kind of strange where

02:25:46.237 --> 02:25:48.239
they're pretty go so that it

02:25:48.306 --> 02:25:50.708
turns out to be very valuable

02:25:50.775 --> 02:25:53.778
last year we had a report of an

02:25:53.845 --> 02:25:55.246
enormous number of well citing

02:25:55.313 --> 02:25:56.814
tough Monterey right before the

02:25:56.881 --> 02:25:58.316
season right around that you

02:25:58.382 --> 02:26:00.017
back two minutes that caused

02:26:00.084 --> 02:26:02.253
us great concern we checked

02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:03.354
with the fishermen through this

02:26:03.421 --> 02:26:05.022
tax single will were not seen

02:26:05.089 --> 02:26:06.858
the whales so that causes to

02:26:06.924 --> 02:26:10.128
investigate further than the

02:26:10.194 --> 02:26:11.562
were in close to shore the

02:26:11.629 --> 02:26:13.164
whales were way off shore no

02:26:13.231 --> 02:26:15.766
Kirk CO a current and we were

02:26:15.833 --> 02:26:17.468
relieved so that's the kind

02:26:17.535 --> 02:26:18.803
of dynamics this group's gonna

02:26:18.870 --> 02:26:21.639
have to work with and then you

02:26:21.706 --> 02:26:23.774
know Hey we don't have to but

02:26:23.841 --> 02:26:25.009
at some point where we realize

02:26:25.076 --> 02:26:26.644
we have an an act unacceptable

02:26:26.711 --> 02:26:29.213
event that's about to occur

02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:30.948
we have to have a mechanism to

02:26:31.015 --> 02:26:32.884
both communicate to the fleet

02:26:32.950 --> 02:26:34.652
a you need to do this in this

02:26:34.719 --> 02:26:35.820
amount of time and then have

02:26:35.887 --> 02:26:36.888
some way to make sure they can

02:26:36.954 --> 02:26:38.623
actually accomplish that or

02:26:38.689 --> 02:26:40.024
provide assistance for them to

02:26:40.091 --> 02:26:41.592
be able to do that so those are

02:26:41.659 --> 02:26:42.960
kind of the things were working

02:26:43.027 --> 02:26:44.996
on going forward is actually

02:26:45.062 --> 02:26:46.831
to be able to implement and

02:26:46.898 --> 02:26:48.866
see results through the system

02:26:48.933 --> 02:26:50.134
and I'll available for any

02:26:50.201 --> 02:26:53.070
questions you might have

02:26:53.137 --> 02:26:53.938
very grateful for all your

02:26:54.005 --> 02:26:55.673
work in the even at this many

02:26:55.740 --> 02:26:57.375
years in we so appreciate so

02:26:57.441 --> 02:26:58.242
keep thank you very much for

02:26:58.309 --> 02:26:59.210
being here today it's always

02:26:59.277 --> 02:27:00.611
good to see will be asking

02:27:00.678 --> 02:27:02.580
questions here just a bit

02:27:02.647 --> 02:27:03.748
we're grateful to Dr Jeff

02:27:03.814 --> 02:27:05.216
masters here he's the captain

02:27:05.283 --> 02:27:06.684
program director for Oceania

02:27:06.751 --> 02:27:08.219
he's gonna be addressing his

02:27:08.286 --> 02:27:09.453
experience with the working

02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:11.122
group process including some

02:27:11.189 --> 02:27:12.557
options in regards to future

02:27:12.623 --> 02:27:14.492
work and potential studies

02:27:14.559 --> 02:27:15.927
as well Jeff's could you see

02:27:15.993 --> 02:27:17.929
Sir for Georgia five minutes

02:27:17.995 --> 02:27:19.564
a very much Chen McGuire --

02:27:19.630 --> 02:27:20.798
vice chair stone it's really

02:27:20.865 --> 02:27:21.732
an honor to be here thank you

02:27:21.799 --> 02:27:22.967
for the invitation with them

02:27:23.034 --> 02:27:26.103
by the way a at fish team tap

02:27:26.170 --> 02:27:27.538
I had to I got my crap socks

02:27:27.605 --> 02:27:29.140
on to all right Hey we got

02:27:29.207 --> 02:27:32.877
your own their doubts -- so

02:27:32.944 --> 02:27:33.911
I'm I'm gonna talk today on

02:27:33.978 --> 02:27:35.746
behalf of -- Oceania as well

02:27:35.813 --> 02:27:37.982
as -- my my -- colleague --

02:27:38.049 --> 02:27:39.417
Andre trees worth justice is

02:27:39.483 --> 02:27:40.685
also on the working group --

02:27:40.751 --> 02:27:42.420
representing the organization

02:27:42.486 --> 02:27:43.788
-- I want to start by saying

02:27:43.854 --> 02:27:45.089
that whales and the marine by

02:27:45.156 --> 02:27:46.724
our environment are important

02:27:46.791 --> 02:27:48.593
of the people of California and

02:27:48.659 --> 02:27:49.627
one of the things that makes me

02:27:49.694 --> 02:27:50.928
so excited to be on the working

02:27:50.995 --> 02:27:52.563
group is that we have a shared

02:27:52.630 --> 02:27:54.732
vision of both thriving marine

02:27:54.799 --> 02:27:56.701
life and thriving fisheries I

02:27:56.767 --> 02:27:58.536
love the crab and want to see

02:27:58.603 --> 02:27:59.737
that just just as much as I

02:27:59.804 --> 02:28:01.706
want to see you healthy Wales

02:28:01.772 --> 02:28:02.640
so I think that we're not

02:28:02.707 --> 02:28:03.708
none of us want to see these

02:28:03.774 --> 02:28:05.376
animals entangled in our waters

02:28:05.443 --> 02:28:06.577
and similar the value the

02:28:06.644 --> 02:28:07.812
Pacific leatherback sea turtle

02:28:07.878 --> 02:28:09.580
California state marine reptile

02:28:09.647 --> 02:28:10.915
is critically endangered and

02:28:10.982 --> 02:28:12.450
in the Klein and also risk

02:28:12.516 --> 02:28:13.951
of entanglement so today

02:28:14.018 --> 02:28:15.019
I'm gonna be discussing some

02:28:15.086 --> 02:28:15.987
highlights from the working

02:28:16.053 --> 02:28:17.722
group's recent twenty eighteen

02:28:17.788 --> 02:28:19.090
nineteen recommendations and

02:28:19.156 --> 02:28:20.424
also provide a brief overview

02:28:20.491 --> 02:28:22.026
of some gear innovation testing

02:28:22.093 --> 02:28:23.861
-- the result involving rope

02:28:23.928 --> 02:28:24.996
was fishing gear that the I've

02:28:25.062 --> 02:28:27.398
been involved with -- first

02:28:27.465 --> 02:28:28.599
on behalf of the conservation

02:28:28.666 --> 02:28:29.767
community we're very grateful

02:28:29.834 --> 02:28:31.502
to the legislature for passing

02:28:31.569 --> 02:28:34.171
SB thirteen oh nine which led

02:28:34.238 --> 02:28:36.240
by center McGuire providing

02:28:36.307 --> 02:28:37.341
the department with authority

02:28:37.408 --> 02:28:38.542
and direction to implement

02:28:38.609 --> 02:28:39.677
this rant program we've been

02:28:39.744 --> 02:28:41.312
talking about as well as for

02:28:41.379 --> 02:28:42.713
that a seven point five million

02:28:42.780 --> 02:28:44.548
in in general funds to assist

02:28:44.615 --> 02:28:46.584
the OPC in finding solutions

02:28:46.651 --> 02:28:48.419
we really commend the the crab

02:28:48.486 --> 02:28:49.553
fleet for really stepping up

02:28:49.620 --> 02:28:50.888
and recognizing this issue

02:28:50.955 --> 02:28:52.757
-- right from the get go also

02:28:52.823 --> 02:28:54.191
the Dungeness crab task force

02:28:54.258 --> 02:28:55.326
in the department and the the

02:28:55.393 --> 02:28:56.294
members that have dedicated

02:28:56.360 --> 02:28:57.094
their time in the working

02:28:57.161 --> 02:28:58.796
group towards really solving

02:28:58.863 --> 02:28:59.964
a very difficult problem

02:29:00.031 --> 02:29:01.165
and and building trust and

02:29:01.232 --> 02:29:02.800
partnership together including

02:29:02.867 --> 02:29:04.235
-- want to mention some of

02:29:04.302 --> 02:29:05.603
the new regulations on surface

02:29:05.670 --> 02:29:06.871
gear that the department just

02:29:06.937 --> 02:29:08.172
implemented as well as the

02:29:08.239 --> 02:29:09.173
commitment that was announced

02:29:09.240 --> 02:29:10.908
today by the apart department

02:29:10.975 --> 02:29:12.610
-- the working group has

02:29:12.677 --> 02:29:13.844
really made some strides in

02:29:13.911 --> 02:29:14.979
understanding this we have

02:29:15.046 --> 02:29:16.347
spent hours going through

02:29:16.414 --> 02:29:17.448
the data on this in trying

02:29:17.515 --> 02:29:18.416
to understand the science

02:29:18.482 --> 02:29:19.750
that the doctors and torrent

02:29:19.817 --> 02:29:21.152
others have brought to us and

02:29:21.218 --> 02:29:22.086
we really want to ensure that

02:29:22.153 --> 02:29:23.087
all the separate results in

02:29:23.154 --> 02:29:25.189
an effective program so the

02:29:25.256 --> 02:29:26.824
last three years of of our

02:29:26.891 --> 02:29:28.225
deliberations is really --

02:29:28.292 --> 02:29:29.593
developed what we consider to

02:29:29.660 --> 02:29:31.028
be a very solid framework to

02:29:31.095 --> 02:29:32.596
begin addressing this problem

02:29:32.663 --> 02:29:33.698
and so I wanted to highlight

02:29:33.764 --> 02:29:36.534
-- three -- three three kind of

02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:38.969
areas so what we on the on the

02:29:39.036 --> 02:29:40.571
crowd on the on the solutions

02:29:40.638 --> 02:29:42.373
-- piece -- we've developed a

02:29:42.440 --> 02:29:44.241
whole new number of of areas

02:29:44.308 --> 02:29:45.543
that have have really been

02:29:45.609 --> 02:29:47.445
-- critical towards -- moving

02:29:47.511 --> 02:29:48.979
forward with this and I'm gonna

02:29:49.046 --> 02:29:50.247
jump actually to the next --

02:29:50.314 --> 02:29:51.749
slide here one of the first

02:29:51.816 --> 02:29:53.284
key questions we have to ask

02:29:53.351 --> 02:29:54.552
getting to solve these issue of

02:29:54.618 --> 02:29:56.087
of co occurrence of the year is

02:29:56.153 --> 02:29:57.421
where the whales in the turtles

02:29:57.488 --> 02:29:59.123
and the gear actually at and so

02:29:59.190 --> 02:30:00.658
this is an example -- picture

02:30:00.725 --> 02:30:02.960
of a of a -- aerial survey

02:30:03.027 --> 02:30:04.628
results that shows -- what's

02:30:04.695 --> 02:30:05.663
on he was actually just talking

02:30:05.730 --> 02:30:06.764
about where you could see the

02:30:06.831 --> 02:30:08.065
whales in relation to wear the

02:30:08.132 --> 02:30:09.533
gear is and evaluate whether

02:30:09.600 --> 02:30:10.768
there is co occurrence or not

02:30:10.835 --> 02:30:12.503
and where it might be -- the

02:30:12.570 --> 02:30:13.771
working group is recommended

02:30:13.838 --> 02:30:15.039
expanding these aerial and

02:30:15.106 --> 02:30:16.841
vessel surveys conducting more

02:30:16.907 --> 02:30:18.642
the forge analysis -- it's

02:30:18.709 --> 02:30:19.877
connecting tagging studies of

02:30:19.944 --> 02:30:21.512
the whales using well watching

02:30:21.579 --> 02:30:23.080
data developing predictive

02:30:23.147 --> 02:30:24.648
models partnering with the U.

02:30:24.715 --> 02:30:26.283
S. Coast Guard and then also

02:30:26.350 --> 02:30:28.119
expanding the -- the use of

02:30:28.185 --> 02:30:29.987
these solar data loggers and

02:30:30.054 --> 02:30:31.389
and really the many of these

02:30:31.455 --> 02:30:32.723
have yet to be funded and the

02:30:32.790 --> 02:30:33.891
working group has requested the

02:30:33.958 --> 02:30:35.860
OPC fund this work one being --

02:30:35.926 --> 02:30:37.528
the solar data loggers -- that

02:30:37.595 --> 02:30:39.096
has been done these basically

02:30:39.163 --> 02:30:41.132
track fishing vessel locations

02:30:41.198 --> 02:30:42.433
-- to identify where traps

02:30:42.500 --> 02:30:43.934
are being set while protecting

02:30:44.001 --> 02:30:45.102
protecting the confidential

02:30:45.169 --> 02:30:46.570
proprietary individual in the

02:30:46.637 --> 02:30:48.506
beginning information -- so

02:30:48.572 --> 02:30:50.307
this was recently -- expanded

02:30:50.374 --> 02:30:51.509
based on a recommendation

02:30:51.575 --> 02:30:52.977
and the OPC recently did fund

02:30:53.043 --> 02:30:54.945
this work and we -- -- as a

02:30:55.012 --> 02:30:56.380
conservation communities do

02:30:56.447 --> 02:30:57.381
this is a step on the right

02:30:57.448 --> 02:30:58.749
direction I would encourage

02:30:58.816 --> 02:30:59.817
the state to move toward a

02:30:59.884 --> 02:31:01.619
goal of a hundred percent --

02:31:01.685 --> 02:31:02.987
data logger coverage across

02:31:03.053 --> 02:31:04.588
all its fix your fisheries

02:31:04.655 --> 02:31:05.456
this is something that is

02:31:05.523 --> 02:31:06.857
going to have an about major

02:31:06.924 --> 02:31:08.359
pay offs in understanding

02:31:08.426 --> 02:31:10.094
the fishing dynamics -- and

02:31:10.161 --> 02:31:11.429
also understanding how to

02:31:11.495 --> 02:31:12.797
better enforce and fine tune

02:31:12.863 --> 02:31:14.265
regulations as well as with

02:31:14.331 --> 02:31:15.633
the effects of any regulations

02:31:15.699 --> 02:31:17.701
we might put in might be --

02:31:17.768 --> 02:31:19.770
regarding -- the next kind

02:31:19.837 --> 02:31:20.871
of piece of this and the gear

02:31:20.938 --> 02:31:22.440
innovations front the working

02:31:22.506 --> 02:31:23.874
group represent recommended the

02:31:23.941 --> 02:31:25.242
open ocean protection council

02:31:25.309 --> 02:31:26.343
work with the Pacific states

02:31:26.410 --> 02:31:27.778
marine fisheries commission

02:31:27.845 --> 02:31:29.447
to develop a cure innovations

02:31:29.513 --> 02:31:31.215
review -- and evaluation

02:31:31.282 --> 02:31:32.750
process while supporting it

02:31:32.817 --> 02:31:33.884
of Asian projects that might

02:31:33.951 --> 02:31:35.686
be ready to go this season of

02:31:35.753 --> 02:31:38.022
so I'm in a skip to the next

02:31:38.088 --> 02:31:41.292
slide here -- today of the talk

02:31:41.358 --> 02:31:43.127
about a type of your innovation

02:31:43.194 --> 02:31:44.628
known as roll bliss -- fishing

02:31:44.695 --> 02:31:46.697
gear so right now one thing

02:31:46.764 --> 02:31:48.199
that we do know is one sure

02:31:48.265 --> 02:31:50.134
way to lower risk is to reduce

02:31:50.201 --> 02:31:51.168
the number of vertical lines

02:31:51.235 --> 02:31:52.736
in the water this either means

02:31:52.803 --> 02:31:54.405
closing specific areas during

02:31:54.472 --> 02:31:56.373
periods of high risk for using

02:31:56.440 --> 02:31:58.175
technologies -- that actually

02:31:58.242 --> 02:31:59.477
might allow continued fishing

02:31:59.543 --> 02:32:01.078
without the vertical lines and

02:32:01.145 --> 02:32:02.546
this we believe is the promise

02:32:02.613 --> 02:32:04.048
of reckless here we're not

02:32:04.114 --> 02:32:05.783
asking you today to require

02:32:05.850 --> 02:32:07.051
real click here at this time

02:32:07.117 --> 02:32:08.152
as an alternative but would

02:32:08.219 --> 02:32:09.620
really like your support in

02:32:09.687 --> 02:32:10.955
further testing to see if we

02:32:11.021 --> 02:32:12.323
can turn this into a viable

02:32:12.389 --> 02:32:14.091
solution in the future -- so

02:32:14.158 --> 02:32:15.359
this technology has been used

02:32:15.426 --> 02:32:16.827
for decades in the scientific

02:32:16.894 --> 02:32:18.596
and defence sectors -- they've

02:32:18.662 --> 02:32:20.231
been proven to reliably locate

02:32:20.297 --> 02:32:21.432
retrieving communicate with

02:32:21.499 --> 02:32:22.600
underwater equipment using

02:32:22.666 --> 02:32:24.368
acoustic release devices and

02:32:24.435 --> 02:32:26.337
modems and while applying these

02:32:26.403 --> 02:32:27.771
mature technologies to fishing

02:32:27.838 --> 02:32:29.707
year -- will require more are

02:32:29.773 --> 02:32:31.208
in the efforts we must remember

02:32:31.275 --> 02:32:32.576
we can go from the model T.

02:32:32.643 --> 02:32:34.011
to the test le overnight

02:32:34.078 --> 02:32:35.746
California is famous for its

02:32:35.813 --> 02:32:37.214
innovation just look at Silicon

02:32:37.281 --> 02:32:38.916
Valley and the legislature

02:32:38.983 --> 02:32:40.150
can really play a key role

02:32:40.217 --> 02:32:41.385
in supporting the innovation

02:32:41.452 --> 02:32:42.887
process and developing this

02:32:42.953 --> 02:32:44.655
type in New new technology

02:32:44.722 --> 02:32:46.190
-- so we've done some --

02:32:46.257 --> 02:32:47.591
next slide please we've we've

02:32:47.658 --> 02:32:48.726
actually already conducted some

02:32:48.792 --> 02:32:50.761
proof of concept tests -- with

02:32:50.828 --> 02:32:52.263
three California Dungeness crab

02:32:52.329 --> 02:32:53.831
fishermen -- summer here are in

02:32:53.898 --> 02:32:55.032
the room including a deck here

02:32:55.099 --> 02:32:56.867
on the panel I am take valuable

02:32:56.934 --> 02:32:58.302
information on how to modify

02:32:58.369 --> 02:32:59.870
these existing systems to work

02:32:59.937 --> 02:33:01.672
better on private schools -- we

02:33:01.739 --> 02:33:02.806
also can be in a meeting with

02:33:02.873 --> 02:33:04.508
the marine mammal commission to

02:33:04.575 --> 02:33:06.010
talk about further testing --

02:33:06.076 --> 02:33:07.411
plans for this upcoming fishing

02:33:07.478 --> 02:33:09.179
season and multiple fisherman

02:33:09.246 --> 02:33:11.515
now have expressed interest

02:33:11.582 --> 02:33:12.883
in participating in a full

02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:14.585
operational pilot test program

02:33:14.652 --> 02:33:16.320
over an extended period to work

02:33:16.387 --> 02:33:18.088
toward making this robust year

02:33:18.155 --> 02:33:19.490
more of a fully operational

02:33:19.557 --> 02:33:22.026
-- option and address many of

02:33:22.092 --> 02:33:23.260
the challenges identified thus

02:33:23.327 --> 02:33:25.362
far such is fully developing

02:33:25.429 --> 02:33:26.931
a shipboard operations making

02:33:26.997 --> 02:33:28.098
the systems more affordable

02:33:28.165 --> 02:33:30.000
on a larger scale addressing

02:33:30.067 --> 02:33:31.569
concerns over Ocean noise and

02:33:31.635 --> 02:33:33.037
enabling enforcement of trap

02:33:33.103 --> 02:33:33.971
fisheries that don't have a

02:33:34.038 --> 02:33:35.439
service but we give that to

02:33:35.506 --> 02:33:37.675
me right -- I presented a some

02:33:37.741 --> 02:33:39.276
of this work -- recently at

02:33:39.343 --> 02:33:40.678
the rogue was kind I'm in new

02:33:40.744 --> 02:33:42.146
Bedford Massachusetts attended

02:33:42.212 --> 02:33:43.380
by over a hundred fifty --

02:33:43.447 --> 02:33:44.448
fishermen scientists and

02:33:44.515 --> 02:33:45.783
government agencies and this

02:33:45.849 --> 02:33:47.718
effort is gaining momentum so

02:33:47.785 --> 02:33:49.253
-- the environmental community

02:33:49.320 --> 02:33:50.754
gear manufactures and fishermen

02:33:50.821 --> 02:33:51.922
are are seeking financial

02:33:51.989 --> 02:33:53.791
support and next slide please

02:33:53.857 --> 02:33:56.260
-- to to to to to to try to

02:33:56.327 --> 02:33:57.528
pursue testing this current

02:33:57.595 --> 02:33:59.096
season this is a photo of some

02:33:59.163 --> 02:34:01.098
of the testing -- that that

02:34:01.165 --> 02:34:02.066
was on you can see the the

02:34:02.132 --> 02:34:03.467
movie being that there after

02:34:03.534 --> 02:34:05.135
a successful release -- next

02:34:05.202 --> 02:34:07.338
slide please -- this is -- in

02:34:07.404 --> 02:34:08.639
the words of a caller dialing

02:34:08.706 --> 02:34:10.007
one of the fishermen -- feel

02:34:10.074 --> 02:34:11.208
who has great potential for

02:34:11.275 --> 02:34:12.443
being beneficial used to the

02:34:12.509 --> 02:34:13.844
for the fishery and trap issues

02:34:13.911 --> 02:34:14.912
around the world including

02:34:14.979 --> 02:34:16.614
mitigation well integument

02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:18.082
and more thorough technology

02:34:18.148 --> 02:34:19.316
-- testing the technology

02:34:19.383 --> 02:34:20.684
for should be the next step

02:34:20.751 --> 02:34:22.486
next line so in terms of what

02:34:22.553 --> 02:34:23.520
we're trying to do basically

02:34:23.587 --> 02:34:24.955
seek funding to actually get

02:34:25.022 --> 02:34:26.423
this -- gear on the water this

02:34:26.490 --> 02:34:29.126
coming season -- and also --

02:34:29.193 --> 02:34:30.594
we were hoping that the --

02:34:30.661 --> 02:34:31.829
ocean protection council we

02:34:31.895 --> 02:34:32.796
can work with the department

02:34:32.863 --> 02:34:34.398
to develop a longer term a

02:34:34.465 --> 02:34:36.066
robust testing a comprehensive

02:34:36.133 --> 02:34:38.636
program for the future of go

02:34:38.702 --> 02:34:41.138
ahead next line -- and so what

02:34:41.205 --> 02:34:42.473
the other last recommendation

02:34:42.539 --> 02:34:43.374
wanted to highlight from the

02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:44.842
working group is that the ramp

02:34:44.908 --> 02:34:46.377
currently -- only addresses

02:34:46.443 --> 02:34:47.678
the Dungeness crab fishery

02:34:47.745 --> 02:34:49.013
and is really primarily focus

02:34:49.079 --> 02:34:50.681
on humpback whales and so one

02:34:50.748 --> 02:34:51.949
of the recommendations is to

02:34:52.016 --> 02:34:53.250
really expand the scope of this

02:34:53.317 --> 02:34:54.618
discussion all the commercial

02:34:54.685 --> 02:34:55.786
and recreational fix your

02:34:55.853 --> 02:34:56.887
fisheries that use vertical

02:34:56.954 --> 02:34:58.622
lines this will require action

02:34:58.689 --> 02:34:59.857
by the fish and game commission

02:34:59.923 --> 02:35:01.558
that apartment the legislature

02:35:01.625 --> 02:35:02.693
and California's work in

02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:03.827
the federal Pacific fishery

02:35:03.894 --> 02:35:05.362
management council and this

02:35:05.429 --> 02:35:06.664
discussion also needs to move

02:35:06.730 --> 02:35:07.998
beyond just humpback whales

02:35:08.065 --> 02:35:08.966
the working group is record

02:35:09.033 --> 02:35:10.300
recommended moving out to blue

02:35:10.367 --> 02:35:11.969
whales -- and there and and

02:35:12.036 --> 02:35:13.337
and and the other species that

02:35:13.404 --> 02:35:14.938
are subject to entanglements

02:35:15.005 --> 02:35:16.573
so in summary we're really

02:35:16.640 --> 02:35:17.908
encouraged by the progress that

02:35:17.975 --> 02:35:19.677
has been made just next slide

02:35:19.743 --> 02:35:22.046
-- deserves a picture doing

02:35:22.112 --> 02:35:23.347
some of the testing -- we were

02:35:23.414 --> 02:35:24.481
a part of this is really been

02:35:24.548 --> 02:35:26.216
an exciting for -- thing for me

02:35:26.283 --> 02:35:27.718
personally and professionally

02:35:27.785 --> 02:35:29.653
I really -- -- built some great

02:35:29.720 --> 02:35:30.587
relationships with some of the

02:35:30.654 --> 02:35:32.356
people on this committee --

02:35:32.423 --> 02:35:34.324
and -- and I think that if we

02:35:34.391 --> 02:35:35.926
can -- didn't didn't have a

02:35:35.993 --> 02:35:37.428
science driven framework for a

02:35:37.494 --> 02:35:39.430
solution and and make further

02:35:39.496 --> 02:35:40.431
investments in the day a

02:35:40.497 --> 02:35:41.699
collection development of these

02:35:41.765 --> 02:35:43.267
new technologies and expansion

02:35:43.333 --> 02:35:44.535
of the ramp framework to all

02:35:44.601 --> 02:35:46.170
the fisheries I think we are

02:35:46.236 --> 02:35:47.571
are on the verge of having a a

02:35:47.638 --> 02:35:48.906
solution and it's great to go

02:35:48.972 --> 02:35:50.441
first as a state it's it makes

02:35:50.507 --> 02:35:51.642
me proud to live here thank

02:35:51.709 --> 02:35:52.776
you so much Jeff thank you so

02:35:52.843 --> 02:35:53.811
much and have some questions

02:35:53.877 --> 02:35:56.547
on that -- and some of the --

02:35:56.613 --> 02:35:58.582
cordless aye traps as well so

02:35:58.649 --> 02:35:59.616
happening coming up in just

02:35:59.683 --> 02:36:01.585
a bit and it is our pleasure

02:36:01.652 --> 02:36:02.586
to be able entities Mister

02:36:02.653 --> 02:36:03.887
Augie's commercial fishermen

02:36:03.954 --> 02:36:05.456
religion here in California

02:36:05.522 --> 02:36:06.657
he's in cover the fisherman's

02:36:06.724 --> 02:36:09.626
perspective -- a and I gotta

02:36:09.693 --> 02:36:11.962
say the fleet came to us in two

02:36:12.029 --> 02:36:13.430
thousand fifteen proactively

02:36:13.497 --> 02:36:14.498
to be to say we have to be

02:36:14.565 --> 02:36:15.966
a change the dynamic on the

02:36:16.033 --> 02:36:17.735
ocean as one take a moment say

02:36:17.801 --> 02:36:19.336
thank you to the fleet -- very

02:36:19.403 --> 02:36:20.971
few industries that would say

02:36:21.038 --> 02:36:22.906
come regulate is I a and do

02:36:22.973 --> 02:36:24.241
it quickly and I just want to

02:36:24.308 --> 02:36:25.342
say on behalf of the committee

02:36:25.409 --> 02:36:26.944
thank you miss rob -- for

02:36:27.010 --> 02:36:28.145
bring that forward along with

02:36:28.212 --> 02:36:29.513
that the rest of the fleet

02:36:29.580 --> 02:36:30.814
you're gonna be a focusing on

02:36:30.881 --> 02:36:32.916
education outrage the fleet --

02:36:32.983 --> 02:36:34.384
as well as -- all the different

02:36:34.451 --> 02:36:35.285
meetings have been happening

02:36:35.352 --> 02:36:36.386
to gear modifications even

02:36:36.453 --> 02:36:37.488
advancing the floor is yours

02:36:37.554 --> 02:36:41.391
yet by Sir okay -- my name is

02:36:41.458 --> 02:36:43.260
Dick log in -- I'm a commercial

02:36:43.327 --> 02:36:44.795
fisherman from the day today

02:36:44.862 --> 02:36:45.963
I have the fishing vessel

02:36:46.029 --> 02:36:48.165
carrying gene and I like to

02:36:48.232 --> 02:36:51.201
take a couple seconds in --

02:36:51.268 --> 02:36:53.237
new tell you that I've been on

02:36:53.303 --> 02:36:54.404
the working group now for the

02:36:54.471 --> 02:36:57.341
last couple of years and --

02:36:57.407 --> 02:36:59.810
you feel very very lucky to be

02:36:59.877 --> 02:37:01.245
able to participate with them

02:37:01.311 --> 02:37:04.381
and work from that point one of

02:37:04.448 --> 02:37:06.183
the things that comes to mind

02:37:06.250 --> 02:37:08.118
initially is one of the things

02:37:08.185 --> 02:37:10.287
that the -- the working group

02:37:10.354 --> 02:37:11.889
put together was but a best

02:37:11.955 --> 02:37:14.491
practices guide that was --

02:37:14.558 --> 02:37:16.527
distributed through the fleet

02:37:16.593 --> 02:37:20.097
and help to -- take a look at

02:37:20.164 --> 02:37:23.300
line school -- excessive line

02:37:23.367 --> 02:37:26.036
service secure and -- kind

02:37:26.103 --> 02:37:27.871
of recommended what we felt

02:37:27.938 --> 02:37:30.974
was of an appropriate way to

02:37:31.041 --> 02:37:35.646
fish -- it it it decrease the

02:37:35.712 --> 02:37:37.581
amount of excess line it was

02:37:37.648 --> 02:37:40.984
on service and and of hopefully

02:37:41.051 --> 02:37:44.154
-- decrease the amount of

02:37:44.221 --> 02:37:45.789
opportunity for entanglement

02:37:45.856 --> 02:37:50.727
with with the -- whales the the

02:37:50.794 --> 02:37:53.864
end product -- I I I feel was

02:37:53.931 --> 02:37:56.333
that that made the fisherman

02:37:56.400 --> 02:37:57.434
it helped the fishermen be

02:37:57.501 --> 02:38:00.103
more wear and the help is

02:38:00.170 --> 02:38:02.339
fish responsibly and I feel

02:38:02.406 --> 02:38:04.741
like that's a very strong and

02:38:04.808 --> 02:38:06.610
definite direction that we

02:38:06.677 --> 02:38:09.713
need to continue -- allows been

02:38:09.780 --> 02:38:11.515
said about the solar loggers

02:38:11.582 --> 02:38:14.084
I'm just trying to -- -- --

02:38:14.151 --> 02:38:15.719
-- summarize this is much as

02:38:15.786 --> 02:38:17.020
quickly as possible the soul

02:38:17.087 --> 02:38:19.256
soul loggers we I've had as a

02:38:19.323 --> 02:38:20.958
little girl my vessel for the

02:38:21.024 --> 02:38:24.161
last two years it's -- it's

02:38:24.228 --> 02:38:26.630
a great product -- it doesn't

02:38:26.697 --> 02:38:29.399
require any -- wiring and

02:38:29.466 --> 02:38:32.035
some simple it works of a cell

02:38:32.102 --> 02:38:33.737
signal as we enter into the

02:38:33.804 --> 02:38:36.707
service area where can transmit

02:38:36.773 --> 02:38:38.208
it immediately transmits the

02:38:38.275 --> 02:38:40.010
location and the information

02:38:40.077 --> 02:38:42.546
vessel as as -- -- eight

02:38:42.613 --> 02:38:43.714
tracks the vessel and then

02:38:43.780 --> 02:38:46.016
transmitted information I feel

02:38:46.083 --> 02:38:49.152
like it's a of a very viable

02:38:49.219 --> 02:38:53.557
of -- solution for indicating

02:38:53.624 --> 02:38:58.028
three dynamics and of location

02:38:58.095 --> 02:39:00.464
and effort shift in all the

02:39:00.530 --> 02:39:02.032
things that are important to

02:39:02.099 --> 02:39:07.437
of the ramp program and -- the

02:39:07.504 --> 02:39:09.306
other things that we're testing

02:39:09.373 --> 02:39:12.509
or are like a weak link type

02:39:12.576 --> 02:39:16.246
devices which are -- of one of

02:39:16.313 --> 02:39:17.848
our are working group members

02:39:17.915 --> 02:39:18.982
actually is working with the

02:39:19.049 --> 02:39:21.752
view degradable line -- the

02:39:21.818 --> 02:39:23.587
idea behind this would be to

02:39:23.654 --> 02:39:25.389
have the plot fall off of the

02:39:25.455 --> 02:39:27.557
wheel if possible if it does

02:39:27.624 --> 02:39:30.294
get entangled and therefore

02:39:30.360 --> 02:39:31.929
you know if the line is degree

02:39:31.995 --> 02:39:33.730
double and it's on the --

02:39:33.797 --> 02:39:35.966
animal for a period of time you

02:39:36.033 --> 02:39:38.302
can break fall away and take

02:39:38.368 --> 02:39:40.237
the stress of the the creature

02:39:40.304 --> 02:39:43.006
and allow the this entanglement

02:39:43.073 --> 02:39:45.509
group to potentially come up in

02:39:45.575 --> 02:39:47.778
disentangle the animal easier

02:39:47.844 --> 02:39:49.313
without the stress of the --

02:39:49.379 --> 02:39:51.748
part on the bottom there we've

02:39:51.815 --> 02:39:54.918
also -- been given some of the

02:39:54.985 --> 02:39:57.854
sleeve devices from back east

02:39:57.921 --> 02:40:00.090
-- day or another weak link

02:40:00.157 --> 02:40:02.960
device and of the best thing

02:40:03.026 --> 02:40:04.127
about that would be is that I

02:40:04.194 --> 02:40:05.595
didn't have to splice the line

02:40:05.662 --> 02:40:07.097
all the time and put put these

02:40:07.164 --> 02:40:08.865
notes in here reached here if

02:40:08.932 --> 02:40:10.100
I can avoid that I'd love to

02:40:10.167 --> 02:40:12.269
be able to do that but at the

02:40:12.336 --> 02:40:13.904
the sleep devices similar to

02:40:13.971 --> 02:40:16.239
that -- okay describe is like a

02:40:16.306 --> 02:40:19.576
Chinese finger deal the little

02:40:19.643 --> 02:40:20.811
puzzle you put your fingers in

02:40:20.877 --> 02:40:21.812
there you can't fully figures

02:40:21.878 --> 02:40:24.414
out well that that slides over

02:40:24.481 --> 02:40:26.516
the into the ropes we read that

02:40:26.583 --> 02:40:28.218
into the world and windows is

02:40:28.285 --> 02:40:29.453
an excessive amount of stress

02:40:29.519 --> 02:40:32.322
put on that that -- that wrote

02:40:32.389 --> 02:40:35.058
the rope will break and I've

02:40:35.125 --> 02:40:36.393
tried it the house I've worked

02:40:36.460 --> 02:40:37.728
with my trucks and pulled on

02:40:37.794 --> 02:40:39.162
and it does break in and and

02:40:39.229 --> 02:40:41.298
it and it holds very very well

02:40:41.365 --> 02:40:42.632
the idea behind this would be

02:40:42.699 --> 02:40:44.167
to keep it up in the upper ten

02:40:44.234 --> 02:40:47.404
fathoms of of rope and then

02:40:47.471 --> 02:40:48.805
you know that's apparently

02:40:48.872 --> 02:40:50.273
or that's where we feel them

02:40:50.340 --> 02:40:51.875
the most in in that way that

02:40:51.942 --> 02:40:54.211
will is entangled the most is

02:40:54.277 --> 02:40:55.779
on the upper end of the crab

02:40:55.846 --> 02:40:57.814
here so if in fact we were

02:40:57.881 --> 02:40:59.549
able to utilize a breakaway

02:40:59.616 --> 02:41:01.785
of some type at the at the it

02:41:01.852 --> 02:41:05.355
would it would it would help

02:41:05.422 --> 02:41:08.425
-- keep damage or people keep

02:41:08.492 --> 02:41:09.659
the animal from being injured

02:41:09.726 --> 02:41:12.596
as much -- about two minutes to

02:41:12.662 --> 02:41:14.331
open I'm sorry it too many all

02:41:14.398 --> 02:41:18.068
okay -- I have a as a as Jeff

02:41:18.135 --> 02:41:20.637
is as we mentioned -- you know

02:41:20.704 --> 02:41:21.772
I've worked with the public

02:41:21.838 --> 02:41:23.740
Louise -- there's a awful lot

02:41:23.807 --> 02:41:26.276
to be they need they need to

02:41:26.343 --> 02:41:28.412
work a lot on that it's it's

02:41:28.478 --> 02:41:30.380
it's not real practical -- for

02:41:30.447 --> 02:41:31.982
the fishery at this point I

02:41:32.049 --> 02:41:34.084
believe that it it maybe later

02:41:34.151 --> 02:41:36.486
on -- I'm more than willing

02:41:36.553 --> 02:41:38.588
to try to work with it but --

02:41:38.655 --> 02:41:39.856
at this point it's just not

02:41:39.923 --> 02:41:42.025
something that we can utilize

02:41:42.092 --> 02:41:43.427
efficiently in the in the

02:41:43.493 --> 02:41:47.531
fishery -- we've also done care

02:41:47.597 --> 02:41:50.700
testing with a GPS grease which

02:41:50.767 --> 02:41:53.603
-- would be something that --

02:41:53.670 --> 02:41:55.672
eight eight eight indicates

02:41:55.739 --> 02:41:57.707
when we lost year or cure gets

02:41:57.774 --> 02:41:59.209
out of line and we'd be able to

02:41:59.276 --> 02:42:01.111
for find it on a chart plotters

02:42:01.178 --> 02:42:03.080
that as another technology

02:42:03.146 --> 02:42:06.450
that's coming around -- it also

02:42:06.516 --> 02:42:08.051
would allow us to follow the

02:42:08.118 --> 02:42:10.353
wheel efficiently if infected

02:42:10.420 --> 02:42:12.255
to get tangled and rather

02:42:12.322 --> 02:42:14.091
than having to keep it inside

02:42:14.157 --> 02:42:16.126
include followed on a chart

02:42:16.193 --> 02:42:17.828
and be able to see it from you

02:42:17.894 --> 02:42:19.996
know utilizing GPS accordance

02:42:20.063 --> 02:42:22.966
is -- the main thing I'd like

02:42:23.033 --> 02:42:24.234
to be able to emphasize is

02:42:24.301 --> 02:42:26.036
the effort that the fishermen

02:42:26.103 --> 02:42:29.339
have made to recover lost here

02:42:29.406 --> 02:42:31.408
and not to of the move the

02:42:31.475 --> 02:42:33.877
vertical lines from the water

02:42:33.944 --> 02:42:36.446
of with the support from center

02:42:36.513 --> 02:42:39.416
McGuire -- we I I'm I'm sure

02:42:39.483 --> 02:42:41.485
this is going to improve and

02:42:41.551 --> 02:42:43.520
did these efforts of a crackpot

02:42:43.587 --> 02:42:46.590
recovery had it up in if the

02:42:46.656 --> 02:42:47.657
if they have been around for

02:42:47.724 --> 02:42:49.392
quite awhile we've we've gone

02:42:49.459 --> 02:42:50.827
up we've gone out of her way

02:42:50.894 --> 02:42:51.928
to make sure that we bring is

02:42:51.995 --> 02:42:54.498
gearing so -- want one thing

02:42:54.564 --> 02:42:55.699
I just would like to leave you

02:42:55.765 --> 02:42:58.268
with is that you know -- you've

02:42:58.335 --> 02:42:59.636
got some really innovative

02:42:59.703 --> 02:43:01.438
minds out here the fishermen

02:43:01.505 --> 02:43:03.373
are incredibly intelligent

02:43:03.440 --> 02:43:05.675
and and I mean I I I highly

02:43:05.742 --> 02:43:07.544
respect their their efforts

02:43:07.611 --> 02:43:10.013
and energy to try to mitigate

02:43:10.080 --> 02:43:11.815
these issues so please reach

02:43:11.882 --> 02:43:13.817
out to us and and and thank you

02:43:13.884 --> 02:43:15.552
for your support think so much

02:43:15.619 --> 02:43:16.720
Mister operate for your here

02:43:16.786 --> 02:43:17.787
thank you for all your work

02:43:17.854 --> 02:43:20.524
and then also -- tested at the

02:43:20.590 --> 02:43:21.525
different pieces of equipment

02:43:21.591 --> 02:43:22.893
as well as so important being

02:43:22.959 --> 02:43:23.994
able to go out the field next

02:43:24.060 --> 02:43:25.128
to see how they work thank you

02:43:25.195 --> 02:43:26.696
so much thank you to turn over

02:43:26.763 --> 02:43:27.797
the vice chair of any questions

02:43:27.864 --> 02:43:30.200
comments or if you come some

02:43:30.267 --> 02:43:32.068
of the things that that I'm

02:43:32.135 --> 02:43:33.570
hearing in in part of it I do

02:43:33.637 --> 02:43:35.338
so my questions before about

02:43:35.405 --> 02:43:36.573
the case of a tangle mania

02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:38.842
where were fining tangle but

02:43:38.909 --> 02:43:40.076
really all goes back to the

02:43:40.143 --> 02:43:42.312
science the data collection

02:43:42.379 --> 02:43:44.648
and building professors you

02:43:44.714 --> 02:43:46.616
really talked about ultimately

02:43:46.683 --> 02:43:47.617
we can start to figure this

02:43:47.684 --> 02:43:48.818
out in California but if we

02:43:48.885 --> 02:43:50.086
don't view it as a west coast

02:43:50.153 --> 02:43:52.289
problem then we're not going

02:43:52.355 --> 02:43:53.690
to be finding the the real long

02:43:53.757 --> 02:43:56.726
term solutions and indicates

02:43:56.793 --> 02:43:58.962
you said the we we we can talk

02:43:59.029 --> 02:44:00.297
about gear we can talk about

02:44:00.363 --> 02:44:03.133
science but proving it on the

02:44:03.200 --> 02:44:04.467
ground so that something is

02:44:04.534 --> 02:44:06.937
fissionable that solutions

02:44:07.003 --> 02:44:08.805
are are realistic and part of

02:44:08.872 --> 02:44:10.106
that is the credibility that's

02:44:10.173 --> 02:44:11.308
built by the science by the

02:44:11.374 --> 02:44:13.810
data collection and having

02:44:13.877 --> 02:44:16.279
the ramp and in the end the

02:44:16.346 --> 02:44:18.014
coalition's the passports of

02:44:18.081 --> 02:44:19.616
really being able to bring

02:44:19.683 --> 02:44:20.917
the stakeholders together and

02:44:20.984 --> 02:44:22.586
and have this conversation so

02:44:22.652 --> 02:44:23.486
I see that we've been making

02:44:23.553 --> 02:44:25.255
a lot of progress but I think

02:44:25.322 --> 02:44:26.423
we're really also pointing out

02:44:26.489 --> 02:44:27.691
where we have some gaps in the

02:44:27.757 --> 02:44:30.727
data gaps in funding gaps in in

02:44:30.794 --> 02:44:32.329
would be able to bring science

02:44:32.395 --> 02:44:36.266
to bear so that we can we can

02:44:36.333 --> 02:44:37.634
continue these conversations

02:44:37.701 --> 02:44:40.570
but then inevitably expand --

02:44:40.637 --> 02:44:41.771
up the coast where we're gonna

02:44:41.838 --> 02:44:44.074
need to bring in other states

02:44:44.140 --> 02:44:45.809
eventually we will have with

02:44:45.875 --> 02:44:47.410
the west coast federal partners

02:44:47.477 --> 02:44:49.045
and think are proving to be

02:44:49.112 --> 02:44:50.380
fruitful is because federal

02:44:50.447 --> 02:44:53.149
partners not so much time will

02:44:53.216 --> 02:44:56.653
sort of hopefully sort that out

02:44:56.720 --> 02:44:58.722
but it's a big issue and

02:44:58.788 --> 02:45:00.490
it's it's amazing to hear

02:45:00.557 --> 02:45:01.625
about the strides that

02:45:01.691 --> 02:45:05.228
making but it also is a

02:45:05.295 --> 02:45:06.830
the the areas where we really

02:45:06.896 --> 02:45:08.265
need to be putting more into

02:45:08.331 --> 02:45:09.366
think that's why these kids

02:45:09.432 --> 02:45:10.934
here is a very helpful and

02:45:11.001 --> 02:45:12.769
keeping the committee very well

02:45:12.836 --> 02:45:14.304
connected to what's working

02:45:14.371 --> 02:45:16.106
and what's not working is

02:45:16.172 --> 02:45:17.807
hopefully if one of we can

02:45:17.874 --> 02:45:18.875
bring nothing else to bear

02:45:18.942 --> 02:45:20.577
but some of the resources of

02:45:20.644 --> 02:45:22.145
the the capacity that you're

02:45:22.212 --> 02:45:23.747
going to need to be able to

02:45:23.813 --> 02:45:25.148
answer this question that some

02:45:25.215 --> 02:45:26.716
that were very interested in

02:45:26.783 --> 02:45:29.686
like things like GPS the cost

02:45:29.753 --> 02:45:30.954
of those are coming down and

02:45:31.021 --> 02:45:32.155
putting those of bullies is

02:45:32.222 --> 02:45:33.156
something that's that's really

02:45:33.223 --> 02:45:34.424
very feasible but yet it's

02:45:34.491 --> 02:45:36.426
an additional cost sufficient

02:45:36.493 --> 02:45:37.527
itself we're interested in

02:45:37.594 --> 02:45:38.461
that and I think we need to

02:45:38.528 --> 02:45:39.796
come up with funding mechanisms

02:45:39.863 --> 02:45:40.730
to be able to sure that we're

02:45:40.797 --> 02:45:43.199
getting the solution out ground

02:45:43.266 --> 02:45:45.268
tested and really understand

02:45:45.335 --> 02:45:46.436
the feasibility but that's one

02:45:46.503 --> 02:45:48.505
thing to that that if you can

02:45:48.571 --> 02:45:50.707
track that year you'll be able

02:45:50.774 --> 02:45:52.175
to see for the quickly that

02:45:52.242 --> 02:45:53.343
it's been a table because it's

02:45:53.410 --> 02:45:55.812
moving in a way that it should

02:45:55.879 --> 02:45:57.447
be moving and so with that

02:45:57.514 --> 02:45:59.716
those kinds of early morning

02:45:59.783 --> 02:46:01.151
in a sort of back to the the

02:46:01.217 --> 02:46:03.386
questions about how long that

02:46:03.453 --> 02:46:04.688
that will had been entangled

02:46:04.754 --> 02:46:05.989
in the damage the gets done

02:46:06.056 --> 02:46:08.325
over time the sooner we can

02:46:08.391 --> 02:46:10.560
identify that a PC gears moving

02:46:10.627 --> 02:46:12.329
forward should be moving back

02:46:12.395 --> 02:46:13.530
to the front of the building

02:46:13.596 --> 02:46:15.365
we go five back close to the

02:46:15.432 --> 02:46:17.334
origin and not have to wait

02:46:17.400 --> 02:46:18.535
until it so much further down

02:46:18.601 --> 02:46:20.170
the coast where to do it has

02:46:20.236 --> 02:46:21.504
a dam is that it is so those

02:46:21.571 --> 02:46:23.840
are the kinds of things that

02:46:23.907 --> 02:46:25.075
we should be paying attention

02:46:25.141 --> 02:46:28.178
to but again it's resources and

02:46:28.244 --> 02:46:31.481
it's testing things out to to a

02:46:31.548 --> 02:46:33.917
point where it becomes workable

02:46:33.983 --> 02:46:35.218
side not necessarily for here

02:46:35.285 --> 02:46:36.553
but I would be very interested

02:46:36.619 --> 02:46:38.788
to know because doctor says

02:46:38.855 --> 02:46:40.023
you very interesting you saying

02:46:40.090 --> 02:46:41.424
that that the robust years

02:46:41.491 --> 02:46:44.127
really putting out to be viable

02:46:44.194 --> 02:46:45.261
but from the fishermen stable

02:46:45.328 --> 02:46:47.397
interest but not necessarily

02:46:47.464 --> 02:46:49.132
officials at this point does

02:46:49.199 --> 02:46:50.433
the gaps that that we've

02:46:50.500 --> 02:46:51.701
gotta close it may be able

02:46:51.768 --> 02:46:54.371
to establish a lot more so

02:46:54.437 --> 02:46:55.839
I mean I'm just if you're a

02:46:55.905 --> 02:46:57.107
capsule a kind of the kinds of

02:46:57.173 --> 02:46:58.742
things that are working with

02:46:58.808 --> 02:46:59.876
the technologies that have

02:46:59.943 --> 02:47:01.644
been with the intensity of the

02:47:01.711 --> 02:47:03.947
interesting the things that

02:47:04.013 --> 02:47:05.014
I'd like to say is that you

02:47:05.081 --> 02:47:07.283
know we need to be sure that

02:47:07.350 --> 02:47:08.752
any of these devices that we're

02:47:08.818 --> 02:47:10.553
working on our of one number

02:47:10.620 --> 02:47:12.255
number one cost effective

02:47:12.322 --> 02:47:13.923
and number two or something

02:47:13.990 --> 02:47:15.125
as simple that the fishermen

02:47:15.191 --> 02:47:16.726
can put together in utilized

02:47:16.793 --> 02:47:18.528
immediately it's it's very

02:47:18.595 --> 02:47:21.765
very difficult to begin to we

02:47:21.831 --> 02:47:23.733
invent the wheel and have have

02:47:23.800 --> 02:47:25.902
let's try to put something

02:47:25.969 --> 02:47:28.438
together that just is very

02:47:28.505 --> 02:47:30.306
difficult to operate with or

02:47:30.373 --> 02:47:32.709
with or equipment we've got is

02:47:32.776 --> 02:47:35.011
a way that we do this and it's

02:47:35.078 --> 02:47:38.081
very efficient and -- I you

02:47:38.148 --> 02:47:39.382
know I want to make sure that

02:47:39.449 --> 02:47:41.718
whatever we were doing doesn't

02:47:41.785 --> 02:47:44.621
in able impact is financially

02:47:44.687 --> 02:47:46.389
that mean significantly you

02:47:46.456 --> 02:47:47.524
know we've already gone through

02:47:47.590 --> 02:47:49.926
group changing we tried to

02:47:49.993 --> 02:47:52.262
of a lemonade floating lines

02:47:52.328 --> 02:47:53.863
we tried to go to neutral

02:47:53.930 --> 02:47:56.032
wanted sinks keep these lines

02:47:56.099 --> 02:47:58.268
tie -- we're doing a lot of

02:47:58.334 --> 02:48:00.937
things to try that are simple

02:48:01.004 --> 02:48:03.339
not very not very expensive

02:48:03.406 --> 02:48:04.407
for the fishermen and that's

02:48:04.474 --> 02:48:05.809
extremely important because

02:48:05.875 --> 02:48:08.044
we're we're we're basically

02:48:08.111 --> 02:48:10.513
struggling now as it is and and

02:48:10.580 --> 02:48:12.615
to impact is more financially

02:48:12.682 --> 02:48:13.683
that's a that's a tough one

02:48:13.750 --> 02:48:15.952
for all for the whole three

02:48:16.019 --> 02:48:17.954
okay yeah so copies -- cost

02:48:18.021 --> 02:48:19.622
year compatibility with which

02:48:19.689 --> 02:48:20.723
you have on the boat versus

02:48:20.790 --> 02:48:21.758
what's in the water that's

02:48:21.825 --> 02:48:23.460
great yeah that's it okay

02:48:23.526 --> 02:48:25.195
died I understand that come

02:48:25.261 --> 02:48:27.497
and then the a lot better --

02:48:27.564 --> 02:48:29.232
thank you this is always been

02:48:29.299 --> 02:48:30.500
very informative and I think

02:48:30.567 --> 02:48:32.569
we're really laying out the

02:48:32.635 --> 02:48:34.370
past as well as the continuing

02:48:34.437 --> 02:48:35.371
challenge that we have in

02:48:35.438 --> 02:48:36.473
order to be able to solve this

02:48:36.539 --> 02:48:38.441
problem but I do agree starting

02:48:38.508 --> 02:48:40.510
to look more west coast

02:48:40.577 --> 02:48:44.314
rather than just California

02:48:44.380 --> 02:48:45.748
thank you thinks which is

02:48:45.815 --> 02:48:48.218
fresher would like to talk

02:48:48.284 --> 02:48:51.154
about the events -- could you

02:48:51.221 --> 02:48:52.989
see what we saw two thousand

02:48:53.056 --> 02:48:54.157
fifteen more frequently

02:48:54.224 --> 02:48:55.158
occurring and then I also

02:48:55.225 --> 02:48:58.394
want talk about modeling so

02:48:58.461 --> 02:49:00.363
we looked at September October

02:49:00.430 --> 02:49:02.866
is the peak this year --

02:49:02.932 --> 02:49:04.934
in regards to the mall cash

02:49:05.001 --> 02:49:06.569
said then we started to see

02:49:06.636 --> 02:49:09.672
it simmer down -- here as we

02:49:09.739 --> 02:49:11.875
approach the end of the year is

02:49:11.941 --> 02:49:14.177
that something that folks saw

02:49:14.244 --> 02:49:15.378
what we need to be a to do to

02:49:15.445 --> 02:49:16.846
be you have a better prediction

02:49:16.913 --> 02:49:21.217
model -- as we move for

02:49:21.284 --> 02:49:22.118
I think you're getting very

02:49:22.185 --> 02:49:24.220
good advice on the demo casted

02:49:24.287 --> 02:49:27.056
from professor Cannella and

02:49:27.123 --> 02:49:28.191
-- the one thing I'll say

02:49:28.258 --> 02:49:30.560
about this this coming season

02:49:30.627 --> 02:49:34.264
is -- the north Pacific is

02:49:34.330 --> 02:49:36.399
anomalously warm this this

02:49:36.466 --> 02:49:38.701
this one this one and that's

02:49:38.768 --> 02:49:41.971
concerning and some have --

02:49:42.038 --> 02:49:43.139
suggested that we might see

02:49:43.206 --> 02:49:44.541
the return of a small warm

02:49:44.607 --> 02:49:46.209
blog this winter many for the

02:49:46.276 --> 02:49:47.777
Michael and that that that does

02:49:47.844 --> 02:49:49.379
happen we would see persistent

02:49:49.445 --> 02:49:51.915
demo castle and reduction of up

02:49:51.981 --> 02:49:53.316
Welling reduction of our normal

02:49:53.383 --> 02:49:55.184
porridge community that we have

02:49:55.251 --> 02:49:57.353
regarding long term outlook

02:49:57.420 --> 02:49:59.222
-- it's been hypothesized

02:49:59.289 --> 02:50:00.690
that upwelling intensity is

02:50:00.757 --> 02:50:02.659
going to increase with global

02:50:02.725 --> 02:50:04.794
warming and I think there's

02:50:04.861 --> 02:50:06.996
number studies now that have --

02:50:07.063 --> 02:50:08.398
demonstrated that in fact that

02:50:08.464 --> 02:50:09.933
has happened over the last four

02:50:09.999 --> 02:50:12.569
four decades -- but the thing

02:50:12.635 --> 02:50:14.304
that I'm most concerned with

02:50:14.370 --> 02:50:16.339
-- we can have all the great

02:50:16.406 --> 02:50:17.907
up Welling we we can have with

02:50:17.974 --> 02:50:19.776
all the changes and wins and

02:50:19.842 --> 02:50:22.045
-- atmospheric conditions but

02:50:22.111 --> 02:50:23.880
that it can be destabilizing

02:50:23.947 --> 02:50:26.249
could remove the typical forage

02:50:26.316 --> 02:50:28.251
base of creel in rock fishing

02:50:28.318 --> 02:50:30.386
things and moving off shore

02:50:30.453 --> 02:50:31.821
and so we can actually be

02:50:31.888 --> 02:50:33.990
detrimental to our ecosystem

02:50:34.057 --> 02:50:35.959
that we have dependent on and

02:50:36.025 --> 02:50:37.093
one of the biggest concerns

02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:38.194
that I've tried to highlight

02:50:38.261 --> 02:50:40.463
is that with increased --

02:50:40.530 --> 02:50:42.632
ocean warming Kering off

02:50:42.699 --> 02:50:44.133
shore wonder things that we're

02:50:44.200 --> 02:50:46.135
expecting to happen is that

02:50:46.202 --> 02:50:48.404
the cold water habitat is

02:50:48.471 --> 02:50:50.206
going to be compressed closer

02:50:50.273 --> 02:50:51.908
to short as can be we might

02:50:51.975 --> 02:50:53.176
have good up willing but only

02:50:53.242 --> 02:50:55.144
be a tiny sliver and that's

02:50:55.211 --> 02:50:56.613
when we run into problems when

02:50:56.679 --> 02:50:58.548
the predators that typically

02:50:58.615 --> 02:51:00.083
live out in the open ocean the

02:51:00.149 --> 02:51:01.651
large cetaceans and other sea

02:51:01.718 --> 02:51:03.519
birds when they can't find food

02:51:03.586 --> 02:51:04.854
they're coming on to the shelf

02:51:04.921 --> 02:51:06.155
that puts them into direct

02:51:06.222 --> 02:51:09.192
interaction with humans papers

02:51:09.258 --> 02:51:10.526
so that that that's sort of a

02:51:10.593 --> 02:51:11.861
long term perspective that we

02:51:11.928 --> 02:51:13.663
think we're gonna see more --

02:51:13.730 --> 02:51:15.431
frequent heat waves of rain

02:51:15.498 --> 02:51:17.700
heatwaves right and lack of and

02:51:17.767 --> 02:51:19.502
reduction of up Welling habitat

02:51:19.569 --> 02:51:21.504
one California coast in your

02:51:21.571 --> 02:51:22.605
seen this in other areas of

02:51:22.672 --> 02:51:25.608
the plan as well yes yeah you

02:51:25.675 --> 02:51:27.410
can law you can do a search for

02:51:27.477 --> 02:51:28.845
large marine heat waves there's

02:51:28.911 --> 02:51:30.880
actually a really nice --

02:51:30.947 --> 02:51:32.482
website that makes predictions

02:51:32.548 --> 02:51:33.816
it's not a matter of time there

02:51:33.883 --> 02:51:34.984
it is there's heat waves right

02:51:35.051 --> 02:51:36.953
now all over the earth and

02:51:37.020 --> 02:51:38.855
they have a as we've learned

02:51:38.921 --> 02:51:40.790
here in California they have

02:51:40.857 --> 02:51:42.458
drastic impacts on our social

02:51:42.525 --> 02:51:45.762
economic conditions absolutely

02:51:45.828 --> 02:51:49.399
-- two thousand fifteen how

02:51:49.465 --> 02:51:50.533
would you characterize the

02:51:50.600 --> 02:51:54.137
event in a to -- so we're

02:51:54.203 --> 02:51:55.304
coming out of that the worst

02:51:55.371 --> 02:51:57.106
drought California's had twelve

02:51:57.173 --> 02:51:59.442
hundred years how would you

02:51:59.509 --> 02:52:01.177
describe the event in two

02:52:01.244 --> 02:52:04.047
thousand fifteen unprecedented

02:52:04.113 --> 02:52:05.715
we have never seen that before

02:52:05.782 --> 02:52:07.016
and here you got to keep

02:52:07.083 --> 02:52:08.284
in mind that the long term

02:52:08.351 --> 02:52:10.253
record of of observations of

02:52:10.319 --> 02:52:11.487
global temperature at that

02:52:11.554 --> 02:52:14.357
are a reliable -- coming

02:52:14.424 --> 02:52:15.458
from ship based measurements

02:52:15.525 --> 02:52:16.492
and stuff like that it's

02:52:16.559 --> 02:52:17.994
only about a hundred years

02:52:18.061 --> 02:52:19.662
of our a record -- sure we

02:52:19.729 --> 02:52:20.697
have other information that

02:52:20.763 --> 02:52:22.098
goes back in with high scores

02:52:22.165 --> 02:52:23.099
another sentiment coursing

02:52:23.166 --> 02:52:25.735
things but in terms of the

02:52:25.802 --> 02:52:27.370
the destabilizing affect at

02:52:27.437 --> 02:52:30.039
that emergence of the blob

02:52:30.106 --> 02:52:31.541
in el Nino in twenty fifteen

02:52:31.607 --> 02:52:32.642
twenty sixteen we've never

02:52:32.709 --> 02:52:34.677
seen anything like that before

02:52:34.744 --> 02:52:36.879
and earlier comment was that

02:52:36.946 --> 02:52:37.980
you know California's one

02:52:38.047 --> 02:52:39.282
of the highest bio diversity

02:52:39.348 --> 02:52:40.616
places and and the state in

02:52:40.683 --> 02:52:42.618
the country -- in things that

02:52:42.685 --> 02:52:45.221
kept us off very early was

02:52:45.288 --> 02:52:47.523
extreme biodiversity positive

02:52:47.590 --> 02:52:49.559
anomalies in the open ocean

02:52:49.625 --> 02:52:50.893
coming from subtropical as

02:52:50.960 --> 02:52:52.929
were cut week we saw the first

02:52:52.995 --> 02:52:54.697
tropical is ation of bands that

02:52:54.764 --> 02:52:56.733
we that we never see we've had

02:52:56.799 --> 02:52:59.068
species we were caught in the

02:52:59.135 --> 02:53:01.237
long term troll surveys that

02:53:01.304 --> 02:53:02.271
I work with and especially

02:53:02.338 --> 02:53:03.606
surveys over thirty years

02:53:03.673 --> 02:53:04.974
we've never seen this species

02:53:05.041 --> 02:53:07.510
composition before had critters

02:53:07.577 --> 02:53:08.644
are coming from the south

02:53:08.711 --> 02:53:09.746
and further offshore and the

02:53:09.812 --> 02:53:11.380
pirates arms or another another

02:53:11.447 --> 02:53:14.117
great example that nots those

02:53:14.183 --> 02:53:17.687
of those larger see -- I see

02:53:17.754 --> 02:53:19.589
tackle things of the Washington

02:53:19.655 --> 02:53:21.124
beach yeah yeah we've never

02:53:21.190 --> 02:53:22.291
seen this change I think we

02:53:22.358 --> 02:53:24.093
had a squid harvest up in --

02:53:24.160 --> 02:53:25.528
crescent city -- which was

02:53:25.595 --> 02:53:29.198
just a unbelievable yeah yeah

02:53:29.265 --> 02:53:30.500
it was an eco system stress

02:53:30.566 --> 02:53:32.969
test driven by climate change

02:53:33.035 --> 02:53:34.070
that we've never seen before

02:53:34.137 --> 02:53:37.006
and -- I hope we don't see

02:53:37.073 --> 02:53:38.608
more frequent events but it's

02:53:38.674 --> 02:53:39.942
it's likely that we will it's

02:53:40.009 --> 02:53:43.412
not a matter of if it's one

02:53:43.479 --> 02:53:47.850
to be able to pull a --

02:53:47.917 --> 02:53:49.519
for fisheries because I think

02:53:49.585 --> 02:53:52.188
that the peace Lara times in

02:53:52.255 --> 02:53:55.358
my issues come down the price

02:53:55.424 --> 02:53:58.161
right -- so what is it gonna

02:53:58.227 --> 02:54:00.429
take to be able to mass produce

02:54:00.496 --> 02:54:01.731
something that is reliable and

02:54:01.798 --> 02:54:03.933
how many years out are we sell

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:06.102
two part question number one

02:54:06.169 --> 02:54:08.271
how far out are we because at

02:54:08.337 --> 02:54:10.573
field testing right obviously

02:54:10.640 --> 02:54:12.175
this is more work to be done

02:54:12.241 --> 02:54:15.144
is heard from doing any to what

02:54:15.211 --> 02:54:16.379
is going to cost to be able to

02:54:16.445 --> 02:54:18.381
look at a reliable alternative

02:54:18.447 --> 02:54:21.851
to see Dr -- takes at the end

02:54:21.918 --> 02:54:23.186
for the question and I've I've

02:54:23.252 --> 02:54:24.487
-- I've also been involved

02:54:24.554 --> 02:54:25.855
in some of the other -- other

02:54:25.922 --> 02:54:27.290
fisheries where you've seen

02:54:27.356 --> 02:54:29.325
these kind of new innovations

02:54:29.392 --> 02:54:30.893
pop up for example like deep

02:54:30.960 --> 02:54:32.595
set do we gear which started

02:54:32.662 --> 02:54:34.363
as basically a concept or a

02:54:34.430 --> 02:54:36.599
hypothesis that was promising

02:54:36.666 --> 02:54:38.467
and involved from proof of

02:54:38.534 --> 02:54:40.436
concept tests to expansion

02:54:40.503 --> 02:54:42.371
to you know now we're looking

02:54:42.438 --> 02:54:43.773
authorization of that as it is

02:54:43.840 --> 02:54:45.441
an allowable fishing fisheries

02:54:45.508 --> 02:54:47.143
so I would see if a similar

02:54:47.210 --> 02:54:48.845
process here I mean we're not

02:54:48.911 --> 02:54:50.179
saying that this gear is ready

02:54:50.246 --> 02:54:51.747
to use I mean this this is

02:54:51.814 --> 02:54:53.616
basically adopting an existing

02:54:53.683 --> 02:54:54.984
technology that that's out

02:54:55.051 --> 02:54:57.019
there -- so what we've done is

02:54:57.086 --> 02:54:58.688
we we put the we put the gear

02:54:58.754 --> 02:55:00.223
in the water one day right

02:55:00.289 --> 02:55:02.625
just once -- the next step we

02:55:02.692 --> 02:55:04.193
would see would be to basically

02:55:04.260 --> 02:55:06.128
expand that so you give you

02:55:06.195 --> 02:55:07.930
know five or six fishermen you

02:55:07.997 --> 02:55:09.498
know a set of these of these

02:55:09.565 --> 02:55:11.701
movies and basically train them

02:55:11.767 --> 02:55:13.002
and how to use that we would

02:55:13.069 --> 02:55:14.070
we would expect that they would

02:55:14.136 --> 02:55:15.738
be fairly compensated for all

02:55:15.805 --> 02:55:17.006
of their time and involved

02:55:17.073 --> 02:55:19.208
in the testing and basically

02:55:19.275 --> 02:55:20.710
see if they can integrate and

02:55:20.776 --> 02:55:21.944
make the changes on their boat

02:55:22.011 --> 02:55:23.079
to make it work right if it

02:55:23.145 --> 02:55:24.847
doesn't fish I thought you

02:55:24.914 --> 02:55:26.616
said -- there's no point in

02:55:26.682 --> 02:55:27.884
even talking about cost and

02:55:27.950 --> 02:55:29.418
all the other -- issues there

02:55:29.485 --> 02:55:32.288
so I think the the what I I

02:55:32.355 --> 02:55:34.924
could see in terms of a a time

02:55:34.991 --> 02:55:37.760
line -- you know -- the the

02:55:37.827 --> 02:55:40.396
more kind of scaled up pilot

02:55:40.463 --> 02:55:42.131
-- study to actually see can

02:55:42.198 --> 02:55:44.367
you get this year fish then

02:55:44.433 --> 02:55:45.601
what you see what you have is

02:55:45.668 --> 02:55:46.736
the basic you know that the

02:55:46.802 --> 02:55:48.337
scaling up of technology you

02:55:48.404 --> 02:55:49.305
know that the first you know

02:55:49.372 --> 02:55:51.507
DVD player with cost about ten

02:55:51.574 --> 02:55:52.708
thousand dollars right when it

02:55:52.775 --> 02:55:54.043
first came out you go buy one

02:55:54.110 --> 02:55:55.811
for less than fifty Bucks today

02:55:55.878 --> 02:55:58.047
so that it really it depends on

02:55:58.114 --> 02:55:59.482
the of the time the amount that

02:55:59.548 --> 02:56:01.050
that the -- they can work with

02:56:01.117 --> 02:56:02.785
the fishermen -- to figure out

02:56:02.852 --> 02:56:04.387
changes to the system to use

02:56:04.453 --> 02:56:05.988
you know less expensive tech

02:56:06.055 --> 02:56:08.291
technologies but ultimately --

02:56:08.357 --> 02:56:10.059
we would hope that that -- if

02:56:10.126 --> 02:56:11.294
that really does prove to be a

02:56:11.360 --> 02:56:13.095
solution that there would be --

02:56:13.162 --> 02:56:14.630
some partnership some subsidy

02:56:14.697 --> 02:56:16.198
types of efforts because it is

02:56:16.265 --> 02:56:17.500
in everyone's best interest to

02:56:17.566 --> 02:56:19.201
actually -- see this if it's

02:56:19.268 --> 02:56:21.103
a solution so it's got promise

02:56:21.170 --> 02:56:22.872
out there if it works this

02:56:22.939 --> 02:56:24.807
could be the holy grail silver

02:56:24.874 --> 02:56:26.409
bullet we're not saying it is

02:56:26.475 --> 02:56:27.677
yet we're not convinced yet

02:56:27.743 --> 02:56:29.045
but what we've seen so far is

02:56:29.111 --> 02:56:30.813
it's got potential and and we

02:56:30.880 --> 02:56:31.881
like to try to take the next

02:56:31.948 --> 02:56:34.717
step no thank you so yeah I

02:56:34.784 --> 02:56:35.751
would just like that because

02:56:35.818 --> 02:56:38.688
it there's along with that --

02:56:38.754 --> 02:56:39.889
the member the fifth the flea

02:56:39.956 --> 02:56:42.625
has two problems Wales and demo

02:56:42.692 --> 02:56:44.694
Cassie and one of things were

02:56:44.760 --> 02:56:46.729
really interested is learning

02:56:46.796 --> 02:56:48.297
to see if we can adapt and

02:56:48.364 --> 02:56:49.865
make this fleet nimble enough

02:56:49.932 --> 02:56:51.634
to fish around both of those

02:56:51.701 --> 02:56:54.403
problems north I see a future

02:56:54.470 --> 02:56:55.905
along with gear innovation

02:56:55.972 --> 02:56:57.707
where the fisherman's able

02:56:57.773 --> 02:56:59.208
to know exactly we have them

02:56:59.275 --> 02:57:01.110
on the data monitoring needed

02:57:01.177 --> 02:57:02.378
to know where to more gas it

02:57:02.445 --> 02:57:03.980
is a problem where the whales

02:57:04.046 --> 02:57:05.481
are and they are able to fish

02:57:05.548 --> 02:57:07.483
around those problems as an

02:57:07.550 --> 02:57:09.085
alternative or a second way

02:57:09.151 --> 02:57:09.952
to deal with it because it's

02:57:10.019 --> 02:57:11.921
not just one problem may name

02:57:11.988 --> 02:57:13.189
a bill solve the whales but

02:57:13.255 --> 02:57:14.790
if they can't sell the crowd

02:57:14.857 --> 02:57:16.692
there also in trouble so

02:57:16.759 --> 02:57:18.494
there's a synergy here that

02:57:18.561 --> 02:57:20.596
that we're looking at is nimble

02:57:20.663 --> 02:57:23.332
this technology monitoring

02:57:23.399 --> 02:57:25.301
predictive tools to kind of

02:57:25.368 --> 02:57:28.504
make this a very -- adaptive

02:57:28.571 --> 02:57:30.473
fleet going in the future

02:57:30.539 --> 02:57:32.174
don't think things myself is

02:57:32.241 --> 02:57:34.410
about sharing meals for say

02:57:34.477 --> 02:57:35.778
thank you to our entire panel

02:57:35.845 --> 02:57:36.946
very very grateful for all the

02:57:37.013 --> 02:57:38.814
work with the group is well in

02:57:38.881 --> 02:57:40.683
very valuable lessons learned

02:57:40.750 --> 02:57:44.220
here today thank you so much

02:57:44.286 --> 02:57:45.221
there isn't Chen we really

02:57:45.287 --> 02:57:46.222
appreciate you hanging with

02:57:46.288 --> 02:57:48.457
us -- al afternoon in again

02:57:48.524 --> 02:57:50.326
thank you so much the query

02:57:50.393 --> 02:57:51.861
him for all of their work we're

02:57:51.927 --> 02:57:53.462
now gonna be moving on to our

02:57:53.529 --> 02:57:54.997
last panel this is gonna be

02:57:55.064 --> 02:57:57.166
litigation update on all issues

02:57:57.233 --> 02:57:58.634
related to well tank commencing

02:57:58.701 --> 02:58:00.436
fishing gear we're gonna invite

02:58:00.503 --> 02:58:02.204
Christian Monsell to be a to

02:58:02.271 --> 02:58:04.006
come for for the cheesy Ocean

also known as the senior

02:58:06.976 --> 02:58:08.744
attorney -- for the center for

02:58:08.811 --> 02:58:10.413
biological diversity for also

02:58:10.479 --> 02:58:11.714
can invite no up and I back

02:58:11.781 --> 02:58:12.815

02:58:12.882 --> 02:58:13.916
the Pacific coast federation

02:58:13.983 --> 02:58:15.518
of fishermen's association

02:58:15.584 --> 02:58:16.919
I'm here's how it's going to

02:58:16.986 --> 02:58:20.089
work -- Kristen is going to

02:58:20.156 --> 02:58:22.291
be presenting her perspective

02:58:22.358 --> 02:58:23.526
now is going to be presenting

02:58:23.592 --> 02:58:25.528
his perspective -- each will

02:58:25.594 --> 02:58:26.595
have five minutes and we're

open it up for questions from

02:58:32.735 --> 02:58:34.804
the committee as well after

02:58:34.870 --> 02:58:36.806
both a Christian NO a finish up

and crab right after this but

02:58:44.880 --> 02:58:46.148
without that further do the

02:58:46.215 --> 02:58:46.982

is yours thank you so much

02:58:59.995 --> 02:59:01.997
thank you so much time to that

02:59:02.064 --> 02:59:02.965
to the chair and members of

02:59:03.032 --> 02:59:04.266
the committee and the staff for

02:59:04.333 --> 02:59:05.968
organizing this this hearing

02:59:06.035 --> 02:59:07.636
and inviting me to to speak and

02:59:07.703 --> 02:59:08.537
all the work that you've been

02:59:08.604 --> 02:59:10.906
doing to to address this issue

02:59:10.973 --> 02:59:12.475
and as you as you know in my

02:59:12.541 --> 02:59:14.176
name is Chris my cell and I am

02:59:14.243 --> 02:59:15.744
those and legal director at the

02:59:15.811 --> 02:59:17.346
center for biological diversity

02:59:17.413 --> 02:59:18.581
and will be giving a brief

02:59:18.647 --> 02:59:21.283
overview of the the lawsuit

02:59:21.350 --> 02:59:23.686
that we we brought -- and

02:59:23.752 --> 02:59:25.754
though the law under underlying

02:59:25.821 --> 02:59:28.924
that that lawsuit I'm so as

02:59:28.991 --> 02:59:30.126
as we all know this is and

02:59:30.192 --> 02:59:31.327
why it why we're all here

02:59:31.393 --> 02:59:33.295
today California has a whale

02:59:33.362 --> 02:59:35.197
entanglement problem we spent

02:59:35.264 --> 02:59:37.333
a lot of time already talking

02:59:37.399 --> 02:59:38.667
about the numbers so I won't

02:59:38.734 --> 02:59:40.236
get into those but as you can

02:59:40.302 --> 02:59:42.404
see the number of entanglements

02:59:42.471 --> 02:59:43.906
really started to spike or

02:59:43.973 --> 02:59:45.808
into the twenty fourteen and

02:59:45.875 --> 02:59:48.978
have -- in increased on pretty

02:59:49.044 --> 02:59:51.814
pretty astronomically -- since

02:59:51.881 --> 02:59:53.015
then you know they have gone

02:59:53.082 --> 02:59:54.483
down in twenty seventeen but

02:59:54.550 --> 02:59:56.352
are still well well above

02:59:56.418 --> 02:59:58.954
the above the average and --

02:59:59.021 --> 03:00:00.723
the -- commercial Dungeness

03:00:00.789 --> 03:00:02.625
crab fishery in California is

03:00:02.691 --> 03:00:05.661
responsible for the most --

03:00:05.728 --> 03:00:07.029
number of entanglements when

03:00:07.096 --> 03:00:09.231
when the gear type is is now

03:00:09.298 --> 03:00:11.500
and -- you know why do we care

03:00:11.567 --> 03:00:13.135
about this there's also been

03:00:13.202 --> 03:00:15.237
a lot of discussion and with

03:00:15.304 --> 03:00:16.505
respect to what happens to

03:00:16.572 --> 03:00:18.340
whales when they got entangled

03:00:18.407 --> 03:00:19.975
as well as well as the turtles

03:00:20.042 --> 03:00:22.178
and as we've heard it causes

03:00:22.244 --> 03:00:24.413
an incredible amount injury

03:00:24.480 --> 03:00:26.015
is on making kill them because

03:00:26.081 --> 03:00:28.017
the years that we have the --

03:00:28.083 --> 03:00:30.319
and it can also prevent them

03:00:30.386 --> 03:00:33.355
from feeding -- or prevent them

03:00:33.422 --> 03:00:34.823
from being able to reproduce in

03:00:34.890 --> 03:00:36.625
the future because of the the

03:00:36.692 --> 03:00:38.928
straps and the amount of energy

03:00:38.994 --> 03:00:41.063
they they expand when they

03:00:41.130 --> 03:00:44.099
are entangled -- and it's also

03:00:44.166 --> 03:00:45.768
a huge conservation concern

03:00:45.834 --> 03:00:46.969
you're talking about humpback

03:00:47.036 --> 03:00:49.238
whales blue whales and Pacific

03:00:49.305 --> 03:00:51.140
Pacific leatherback sea turtle

03:00:51.207 --> 03:00:53.342
all of which are listed as a

03:00:53.409 --> 03:00:54.710
threatened or endangered under

03:00:54.777 --> 03:00:56.145
the federal Endangered Species

03:00:56.212 --> 03:00:58.948
Act and a and several of the

03:00:59.014 --> 03:01:00.549
of the populations are are

03:01:00.616 --> 03:01:02.551
critically endangered including

03:01:02.618 --> 03:01:04.220
both leatherback sea turtles

03:01:04.286 --> 03:01:05.888
but then also there's one

03:01:05.955 --> 03:01:07.456
population of humpback whales

03:01:07.523 --> 03:01:08.791
off California that feeds

03:01:08.857 --> 03:01:10.292
exclusively off California

03:01:10.359 --> 03:01:12.361
that has just over four hundred

03:01:12.428 --> 03:01:14.163
members of the population

03:01:14.230 --> 03:01:15.998
laughs so any entanglement of

03:01:16.065 --> 03:01:17.399
a member of that population

03:01:17.466 --> 03:01:19.101
particularly a female really

03:01:19.168 --> 03:01:21.170
kind have population level

03:01:21.237 --> 03:01:22.638
impact and may jeopardize the

03:01:22.705 --> 03:01:24.974
the very survival of of that

03:01:25.040 --> 03:01:27.710
of that population -- and in

03:01:27.776 --> 03:01:30.145
addition to being incredibly

03:01:30.212 --> 03:01:32.481
painful and and deadly there

03:01:32.548 --> 03:01:34.950
-- these entanglements of these

03:01:35.017 --> 03:01:36.852
federally protected species are

03:01:36.919 --> 03:01:41.056
also unlawful on the Endangered

03:01:41.123 --> 03:01:44.627
Species Act is a federal law

03:01:44.693 --> 03:01:47.429
that -- sorry about that --

03:01:47.496 --> 03:01:49.999
that and seeks to protect that

03:01:50.065 --> 03:01:51.934
threaten endangered species and

03:01:52.001 --> 03:01:54.603
ecosystems on which they rely

03:01:54.670 --> 03:01:56.572
and has been noted has the most

03:01:56.639 --> 03:01:58.407
comprehensive legislation for

03:01:58.474 --> 03:02:00.643
the protection of endangered

03:02:00.709 --> 03:02:02.911
animals ever enacted by any any

03:02:02.978 --> 03:02:04.513
nation and the plane intent of

03:02:04.580 --> 03:02:07.750
Congress was to reverse I the

03:02:07.816 --> 03:02:09.718
trend of species extinction

03:02:09.785 --> 03:02:11.754
nope no matter the costs and

03:02:11.820 --> 03:02:13.088
one of the most important

03:02:13.155 --> 03:02:14.723
ways that the act does that

03:02:14.790 --> 03:02:16.458
is through section nine of

03:02:16.525 --> 03:02:18.127
the statute which makes it

03:02:18.193 --> 03:02:20.262
unlawful for any person to

03:02:20.329 --> 03:02:21.830
take an endangered species

03:02:21.897 --> 03:02:23.899
or to cause such a take to be

03:02:23.966 --> 03:02:27.269
committed -- ghost take and the

03:02:27.336 --> 03:02:29.571
person are defined very broadly

03:02:29.638 --> 03:02:31.407
under the statute take is

03:02:31.473 --> 03:02:33.008
essentially defined as any act

03:02:33.075 --> 03:02:36.412
that can harm or wound or caps

03:02:36.478 --> 03:02:40.082
or or otherwise just rob --

03:02:40.149 --> 03:02:41.717
essential behavioral patterns

03:02:41.784 --> 03:02:45.087
like feeding breeding -- and

03:02:45.154 --> 03:02:47.690
-- also makes it unlawful to

03:02:47.756 --> 03:02:50.459
to kill them and and and under

03:02:50.526 --> 03:02:52.528
under the statute it -- you

03:02:52.594 --> 03:02:54.563
not just individual people that

03:02:54.630 --> 03:02:55.764
are prohibited from causing

03:02:55.831 --> 03:02:58.600
take but also -- government

03:02:58.667 --> 03:03:00.502
entities Richard of that are

03:03:00.569 --> 03:03:01.570
considered a person under

03:03:01.637 --> 03:03:02.871
under the statute so if you

03:03:02.938 --> 03:03:04.340
had a government entities such

03:03:04.406 --> 03:03:06.342
as a state that is permitting

03:03:06.408 --> 03:03:08.744
an activity that leads to

03:03:08.811 --> 03:03:10.312
entanglements or takes of

03:03:10.379 --> 03:03:12.448
whales and sea turtles that is

03:03:12.514 --> 03:03:15.117
unlawful and -- that this is

03:03:15.184 --> 03:03:17.519
all the basis of a lawsuit that

03:03:17.586 --> 03:03:18.987
we filed here in the Northern

03:03:19.054 --> 03:03:20.556
District in San Francisco in

03:03:20.622 --> 03:03:23.125
October of of twenty seventeen

03:03:23.192 --> 03:03:25.060
and we filed it against the

03:03:25.127 --> 03:03:27.262
department of fish and wildlife

03:03:27.329 --> 03:03:28.430
and we have one claim in the

03:03:28.497 --> 03:03:30.699
Los view that the state's

03:03:30.766 --> 03:03:31.967
permitted permitting and

03:03:32.034 --> 03:03:33.102
management of the commercial

03:03:33.168 --> 03:03:35.671
Dungeness crab fishery is

03:03:35.738 --> 03:03:38.340
harming killing tangling up

03:03:38.407 --> 03:03:41.009
and otherwise causing Tate of

03:03:41.076 --> 03:03:42.611
leatherback sea turtles blue

03:03:42.678 --> 03:03:44.346
whales and and humpback whales

03:03:44.413 --> 03:03:45.981
and that that's a violation of

03:03:46.048 --> 03:03:48.384
of the stats you to me okay I'm

03:03:48.450 --> 03:03:51.286
almost -- and -- V.

03:03:51.353 --> 03:03:53.789
-- we're relief that were

03:03:53.856 --> 03:03:55.324
speaking in in the lawsuit

03:03:55.391 --> 03:03:57.860
is for the the state to get a

03:03:57.926 --> 03:03:59.328
permit from from the federal

03:03:59.395 --> 03:04:00.629
government while take is

03:04:00.696 --> 03:04:02.097
generally prohibited under the

03:04:02.164 --> 03:04:03.766
statute there is an exception

03:04:03.832 --> 03:04:05.934
within the statute by which

03:04:06.001 --> 03:04:07.236
the federal government can a

03:04:07.302 --> 03:04:09.204
permit to take incidental to

03:04:09.271 --> 03:04:12.408
an otherwise unlawful activity

03:04:12.474 --> 03:04:13.909
provided certain conditions

03:04:13.976 --> 03:04:15.778
are met and that there is a

03:04:15.844 --> 03:04:17.646
plan to mitigate the impact

03:04:17.713 --> 03:04:19.681
of that take on on that the

03:04:19.748 --> 03:04:21.316
printer endangered species

03:04:21.383 --> 03:04:23.419
and were also seeking a media

03:04:23.485 --> 03:04:24.753
many mitigation measures

03:04:24.820 --> 03:04:26.422
to significantly reduce the

03:04:26.488 --> 03:04:28.590
risk of of entanglement and

03:04:28.657 --> 03:04:30.926
fantasize -- immediate here

03:04:30.993 --> 03:04:32.094
because there's there's been

03:04:32.161 --> 03:04:33.395
a lot of talk about twenty

03:04:33.462 --> 03:04:34.997
fifteen and twenty sixteen

03:04:35.063 --> 03:04:35.731
and the high number of

03:04:35.798 --> 03:04:37.266
entanglements that we saw there

03:04:37.332 --> 03:04:38.901
and we are we are very very

03:04:38.967 --> 03:04:40.903
concerned about this upcoming

03:04:40.969 --> 03:04:42.404
season given not there's lots

03:04:42.471 --> 03:04:44.273
of of six signals that we may

03:04:44.339 --> 03:04:48.544
see -- another -- another year

03:04:48.610 --> 03:04:50.646
of bad entanglements for Wales

03:04:50.712 --> 03:04:52.414
and the department absolutely

03:04:52.481 --> 03:04:54.149
needs to do everything in its

03:04:54.216 --> 03:04:56.985
power to have a plan in place

03:04:57.052 --> 03:05:00.022
to to ensure that more whales

03:05:00.088 --> 03:05:01.723
and sea turtles Dahle die

03:05:01.790 --> 03:05:03.725
these incredibly painful verbal

03:05:03.792 --> 03:05:06.261
gaffes and in entanglement in

03:05:06.328 --> 03:05:08.497
fishing gear -- any in terms

03:05:08.564 --> 03:05:09.798
of the status of the of the

03:05:09.865 --> 03:05:11.266
litigation -- were and we're

03:05:11.333 --> 03:05:14.203
actively briefing at the --

03:05:14.269 --> 03:05:15.537
the merits of the the case

03:05:15.604 --> 03:05:17.306
right now time we filed our

03:05:17.372 --> 03:05:18.941
opening brief the the end of

03:05:19.007 --> 03:05:20.409
October the department just

03:05:20.476 --> 03:05:22.711
filed its brief -- along

03:05:22.778 --> 03:05:24.513
with PC FFA hood intervened

03:05:24.580 --> 03:05:27.216
as defendants in lawsuits --

03:05:27.282 --> 03:05:28.917
aye and Wednesday of of last

03:05:28.984 --> 03:05:31.553
week -- and we have a brief

03:05:31.620 --> 03:05:33.422
DO in a couple weeks and then

03:05:33.489 --> 03:05:35.524
-- the state and the CFA will

03:05:35.591 --> 03:05:37.025
reply and then we have an oral

03:05:37.092 --> 03:05:38.293
argument currently scheduled

03:05:38.360 --> 03:05:39.495
for the for the beginning of

03:05:39.561 --> 03:05:41.497
affect your eight year the

-- the motions on on summary

03:05:44.066 --> 03:05:45.834
judgment and for the court

03:05:45.901 --> 03:05:49.137
to determine the liability

03:05:49.204 --> 03:05:50.272
this was a thank you so much

03:05:50.339 --> 03:05:51.240
Christian noted all trying to

be pushy -- I just wanna make

03:05:52.875 --> 03:05:53.842
sure that we give equal time I

03:05:53.909 --> 03:05:55.644
mean today so I just I'm very

03:05:55.711 --> 03:05:57.179
grateful thank you so much

we're gonna hang with us so

03:05:58.046 --> 03:05:59.114
we can ask any questions as

03:05:59.181 --> 03:06:00.849
well if you don't mind return

03:06:00.916 --> 03:06:02.251
over and no oftentimes with

03:06:02.317 --> 03:06:03.619
the music check attracted

03:06:03.685 --> 03:06:05.120
specific because federation

03:06:05.187 --> 03:06:07.155
official so she should I should

03:06:07.222 --> 03:06:08.690
have been of this about seven

03:06:08.757 --> 03:06:10.926
minutes and so will I will

03:06:10.993 --> 03:06:12.327
double the units back from

03:06:12.394 --> 03:06:13.729
a crab feast for nearly that

03:06:13.795 --> 03:06:15.297
long Senate we were talking

03:06:15.364 --> 03:06:16.765
please note for two hours

03:06:16.832 --> 03:06:18.700
so -- no Oppenheim executive

03:06:18.767 --> 03:06:19.768
director of the Pacific coast

03:06:19.835 --> 03:06:20.669
federation of fishermen's

03:06:20.736 --> 03:06:23.305
associations -- I'll pick

03:06:23.372 --> 03:06:24.306
up right where miss months a

03:06:24.373 --> 03:06:26.475
left off -- as you mentioned

03:06:26.542 --> 03:06:28.310
organization is defendant

03:06:28.377 --> 03:06:30.279
intervenor in the case on the

03:06:30.345 --> 03:06:32.214
side of the department of fish

03:06:32.281 --> 03:06:36.518
and wildlife in CVV bottom --

03:06:36.585 --> 03:06:38.654
and as month miss once also

03:06:38.720 --> 03:06:40.789
mentioned currently we are in

03:06:40.856 --> 03:06:43.125
the process of -- of educating

03:06:43.191 --> 03:06:44.893
a hearing -- with motions

03:06:44.960 --> 03:06:46.161
for summary judgment having

03:06:46.228 --> 03:06:47.696
that filed by the center for

03:06:47.763 --> 03:06:50.866
biological diversity -- just

03:06:50.933 --> 03:06:52.868
a brief update followed by

03:06:52.935 --> 03:06:55.604
what I met what I view as a

03:06:55.671 --> 03:06:58.240
vision for haves forward both

03:06:58.307 --> 03:06:59.374
with respect to litigation

03:06:59.441 --> 03:07:00.442
in the working group we've

03:07:00.509 --> 03:07:03.078
heard so much about today --

03:07:03.145 --> 03:07:05.914
so PC of a file the response

03:07:05.981 --> 03:07:07.349
motion which essentially --

03:07:07.416 --> 03:07:08.917
supports the department of

03:07:08.984 --> 03:07:10.385
fish and wildlife's opposition

03:07:10.452 --> 03:07:12.988
on facts and on their motion

03:07:13.055 --> 03:07:14.823
for -- their cross motion for

03:07:14.890 --> 03:07:17.459
summary judgment -- we are

03:07:17.526 --> 03:07:19.528
not taking a position on the

03:07:19.595 --> 03:07:21.363
legal jurisdictional side the

03:07:21.430 --> 03:07:23.765
section nine take a liability

03:07:23.832 --> 03:07:26.768
side per se -- we believe that

03:07:26.835 --> 03:07:27.936
department of fish wildlife

03:07:28.003 --> 03:07:29.771
is mounting -- a good strong

03:07:29.838 --> 03:07:31.406
defense on jurisdictional

03:07:31.473 --> 03:07:32.908
and summary judgment process

03:07:32.975 --> 03:07:34.543
issues and we would join them

03:07:34.610 --> 03:07:36.345
in that defense -- there are

03:07:36.411 --> 03:07:38.580
some facts at issue in the

03:07:38.647 --> 03:07:40.148
case that will be discussed

03:07:40.215 --> 03:07:42.017
at the hearing but what's

03:07:42.084 --> 03:07:44.820
not in dispute at all is the

03:07:44.886 --> 03:07:46.755
fact that there is a problem

03:07:46.822 --> 03:07:48.857
in this fishery there is also

03:07:48.924 --> 03:07:51.393
no dispute that the solution

03:07:51.460 --> 03:07:54.463
needs to be one that works for

03:07:54.529 --> 03:07:55.397
commercial fishermen on the

03:07:55.464 --> 03:07:58.166
water I personally believe that

03:07:58.233 --> 03:08:00.102
Senate bill thirteen oh nine

03:08:00.168 --> 03:08:01.103
thank you for your leadership

03:08:01.169 --> 03:08:02.437
Senate required is the path

03:08:02.504 --> 03:08:04.506
forward for that -- I believe

03:08:04.573 --> 03:08:08.176
that it indeed satisfies the

03:08:08.243 --> 03:08:10.445
plea that CVD brings in this

03:08:10.512 --> 03:08:12.614
case that we take immediate

03:08:12.681 --> 03:08:14.850
and meaningful steps to ensure

03:08:14.916 --> 03:08:16.852
that the risk of entanglement

03:08:16.918 --> 03:08:17.786
of large marine mammals

03:08:17.853 --> 03:08:21.223
industries minimize the ramp in

03:08:21.289 --> 03:08:23.525
the working group will do this

03:08:23.592 --> 03:08:25.727
with commercial fishermen with

03:08:25.794 --> 03:08:27.062
environmental organizations

03:08:27.129 --> 03:08:28.730
state and federal agency staff

03:08:28.797 --> 03:08:30.298
scientists disentangle next

03:08:30.365 --> 03:08:31.833
birds at the table working

03:08:31.900 --> 03:08:33.168
together to insure that it's

03:08:33.235 --> 03:08:36.004
done equitably expeditiously

03:08:36.071 --> 03:08:38.440
fairly and permanently in other

03:08:38.507 --> 03:08:39.808
words of a process that will

03:08:39.875 --> 03:08:42.444
work I have extreme confidence

03:08:42.511 --> 03:08:44.179
in folks like Dick agri heard

03:08:44.246 --> 03:08:46.048
from John Miller is also in

03:08:46.114 --> 03:08:47.315
the room Jim Anderson also

03:08:47.382 --> 03:08:49.051
in the room -- for members

03:08:49.117 --> 03:08:51.620
of the working group to both

03:08:51.687 --> 03:08:53.722
make sure that what we develop

03:08:53.789 --> 03:08:55.323
is going to work on the water

03:08:55.390 --> 03:08:57.059
and that their colleagues in

03:08:57.125 --> 03:08:59.227
the industry understand that

03:08:59.294 --> 03:09:02.064
this is the right path to take

03:09:02.130 --> 03:09:03.398
and we will be doing a lot

03:09:03.465 --> 03:09:05.701
of work -- organization are

03:09:05.767 --> 03:09:08.236
colleagues etcetera to -- to

03:09:08.303 --> 03:09:11.206
discuss this issue to make sure

03:09:11.273 --> 03:09:13.275
that fishermen understand that

03:09:13.341 --> 03:09:15.977
this is not only a progressive

03:09:16.044 --> 03:09:18.280
process that will ensure they

03:09:18.346 --> 03:09:20.182
are at the table but that it

03:09:20.248 --> 03:09:21.416
is a process that will ensure

03:09:21.483 --> 03:09:22.684
they will be able to like

03:09:22.751 --> 03:09:24.519
director Bonham said fish

03:09:24.586 --> 03:09:26.288
crap forever because that's

03:09:26.354 --> 03:09:27.422
our ultimate goal and I think

03:09:27.489 --> 03:09:29.057
it's the one that shared by

03:09:29.124 --> 03:09:30.258
the vast vast majority of

03:09:30.325 --> 03:09:31.226
people who are engaged in

03:09:31.293 --> 03:09:34.329
this process so -- I'll just

03:09:34.396 --> 03:09:37.132
conclude by saying that the

03:09:37.199 --> 03:09:38.333
Senate bill thirteen oh nine

03:09:38.400 --> 03:09:41.636
framework creating a process

03:09:41.703 --> 03:09:44.706
an interim process to bring us

03:09:44.773 --> 03:09:46.608
to regulatory implementation

03:09:46.675 --> 03:09:48.944
of the ramp is equitable it's

03:09:49.010 --> 03:09:50.412
fair the criteria for that

03:09:50.479 --> 03:09:51.747
interview process or spelled

03:09:51.813 --> 03:09:53.648
out plainly in your bill

03:09:53.715 --> 03:09:56.551
senator and greatly appreciate

03:09:56.618 --> 03:09:58.386
the fact that those criteria

03:09:58.453 --> 03:09:59.721
will make this work at a

03:09:59.788 --> 03:10:01.490
workable they will make them

03:10:01.556 --> 03:10:02.758
clear transparent they will

03:10:02.824 --> 03:10:04.960
protect safety of life at sea

03:10:05.026 --> 03:10:06.428
-- the logistical aspects of

03:10:06.495 --> 03:10:08.263
the fisheries self and ensure

03:10:08.330 --> 03:10:09.965
above all most importantly that

03:10:10.031 --> 03:10:11.566
we are able to protect large

03:10:11.633 --> 03:10:15.036
remember -- we will get through

03:10:15.103 --> 03:10:17.205
this we will weather the storm

03:10:17.272 --> 03:10:18.707
and we will come out stronger

03:10:18.774 --> 03:10:20.375
for it so thank you thank you

03:10:20.442 --> 03:10:21.443
so much Chau very grateful

03:10:21.510 --> 03:10:22.277
would like to be turned over

03:10:22.344 --> 03:10:23.445
to vice chair to basically

03:10:23.512 --> 03:10:25.380
questions or comments please

03:10:25.447 --> 03:10:26.414
really it's difficult for

03:10:26.481 --> 03:10:28.049
us to comment on on existing

03:10:28.116 --> 03:10:30.919
litigation but I think it's the

03:10:30.986 --> 03:10:33.121
weather regardless the outcome

03:10:33.188 --> 03:10:36.591
of the lawsuit public pressure

03:10:36.658 --> 03:10:38.126
and sort of the court of public

03:10:38.193 --> 03:10:39.628
opinion is starting to weigh

03:10:39.694 --> 03:10:41.163
in more and more significantly

03:10:41.229 --> 03:10:42.364
more well it tackles we see

03:10:42.430 --> 03:10:44.132
if we do see an uptick it will

03:10:44.199 --> 03:10:45.500
take a look I think that's more

03:10:45.567 --> 03:10:47.335
pressure on us on everyone in

03:10:47.402 --> 03:10:50.071
this room to seek solutions

03:10:50.138 --> 03:10:52.240
not in the next three to

03:10:52.307 --> 03:10:56.011
five years but solutions and

03:10:56.077 --> 03:10:58.213
that's really what what we're

03:10:58.280 --> 03:11:00.549
trying to engage here push the

03:11:00.615 --> 03:11:02.818
industry push the technology

03:11:02.884 --> 03:11:04.186
push all the stakeholders and

03:11:04.252 --> 03:11:05.287
make sure that we're looking

03:11:05.353 --> 03:11:07.689
at Bible solutions on the

03:11:07.756 --> 03:11:09.624
shortest possible time right to

03:11:09.691 --> 03:11:11.426
reduce so the horrific things

03:11:11.493 --> 03:11:14.696
that we see we get the more we

03:11:14.763 --> 03:11:17.265
understand those interaction

03:11:17.332 --> 03:11:18.834
the more we understand the

03:11:18.900 --> 03:11:20.335
data the science so that we

03:11:20.402 --> 03:11:22.170
can help direct solutions the

03:11:22.237 --> 03:11:23.572
better off that we're going

03:11:23.638 --> 03:11:26.007
to be so dependent a lawsuit

03:11:26.074 --> 03:11:27.008
that's gonna drive changes

03:11:27.075 --> 03:11:29.311
faster but I would hope we

03:11:29.377 --> 03:11:31.479
would all feel that if it is

03:11:31.546 --> 03:11:33.081
in the need for looking for

03:11:33.148 --> 03:11:34.716
solutions as soon as we can

03:11:34.783 --> 03:11:36.218
because what's at stake is

03:11:36.284 --> 03:11:38.353
really cute and it's not just

03:11:38.420 --> 03:11:40.188
for California than the lawsuit

03:11:40.255 --> 03:11:41.389
is gonna direct this board with

03:11:41.456 --> 03:11:43.225
California's solutions but it

03:11:43.291 --> 03:11:45.660
is a west coast challenge it's

03:11:45.727 --> 03:11:47.128
a much broader challenges we

03:11:47.195 --> 03:11:48.296
seem to be finding ourselves

03:11:48.363 --> 03:11:50.198
whether it's a climate any

03:11:50.265 --> 03:11:52.834
number of areas engaged in and

03:11:52.901 --> 03:11:54.202
solutions that are beyond just

03:11:54.269 --> 03:11:57.739
California by the west coast

03:11:57.806 --> 03:11:59.274
but even internationals we

03:11:59.341 --> 03:12:01.309
look at the ocean acidification

03:12:01.376 --> 03:12:02.410
and other changes that are

03:12:02.477 --> 03:12:04.145
that are going on so this is

03:12:04.212 --> 03:12:05.814
I think a right time for us

03:12:05.881 --> 03:12:07.282
to be having these discussions

03:12:07.349 --> 03:12:10.352
looking for solutions and you

03:12:10.418 --> 03:12:11.720
have to sort out that lawsuit

03:12:11.786 --> 03:12:12.821
in the District Court will sort

03:12:12.888 --> 03:12:14.422
that out for the meantime we

03:12:14.489 --> 03:12:18.260
still have our work cut out

03:12:18.326 --> 03:12:18.994
thank you Mister vice chair

03:12:19.060 --> 03:12:20.128
I think my only comment to be

03:12:20.195 --> 03:12:22.130
this is that -- know that all

03:12:22.197 --> 03:12:23.798
sides are talking -- which I

03:12:23.865 --> 03:12:25.233
think is the best way to go to

03:12:25.300 --> 03:12:27.836
find a solution -- I actually

03:12:27.903 --> 03:12:29.804
think that there are common

03:12:29.871 --> 03:12:33.575
goals -- from all sides -- and

03:12:33.642 --> 03:12:34.709
there may be some different

03:12:34.776 --> 03:12:36.912
paths to get their -- when I'm

03:12:36.978 --> 03:12:37.946
open is that we're gonna be

03:12:38.013 --> 03:12:40.815
able to -- all move forward

03:12:40.882 --> 03:12:43.218
eventually together I do have

03:12:43.285 --> 03:12:46.021
to say I think that -- where

03:12:46.087 --> 03:12:49.958
CVD has been -- wanting to the

03:12:50.025 --> 03:12:51.259
state data will put words in

03:12:51.326 --> 03:12:53.261
your mouth -- but at the nay

03:12:53.328 --> 03:12:54.829
particular that take permits

03:12:54.896 --> 03:12:55.997
I think that is an important

03:12:56.064 --> 03:12:58.366
first step -- above and beyond

03:12:58.433 --> 03:12:59.801
what is already been happening

03:12:59.868 --> 03:13:02.771
with -- legislative solution

03:13:02.837 --> 03:13:05.106
-- so looking at a legislative

03:13:05.173 --> 03:13:06.908
solution I think we need to be

03:13:06.975 --> 03:13:09.277
able to continue to invest in

03:13:09.344 --> 03:13:11.713
resources and moving with our

03:13:11.780 --> 03:13:13.748
federal partners I to be able

03:13:13.815 --> 03:13:16.151
to afford on that take for me

03:13:16.217 --> 03:13:17.319
-- it's well I think it's a

03:13:17.385 --> 03:13:19.120
three pronged approach again

03:13:19.187 --> 03:13:21.690
I am not gonna waited to the

03:13:21.756 --> 03:13:23.892
matters that are at hand of

03:13:23.959 --> 03:13:26.361
both sides -- take a look for

03:13:26.428 --> 03:13:27.729
any closing comments alternate

03:13:27.796 --> 03:13:31.166
over to -- first since --

03:13:31.232 --> 03:13:32.267
recent start with sort of

03:13:32.334 --> 03:13:33.902
analytical street Christopher

03:13:33.969 --> 03:13:35.470
political certainly thank you

03:13:35.537 --> 03:13:38.673
senator -- briefly I what we

03:13:38.740 --> 03:13:40.041
heard from director Bonham

03:13:40.108 --> 03:13:42.544
today without launching into

03:13:42.610 --> 03:13:46.147
a a path forward a solution

03:13:46.214 --> 03:13:49.517
may include the take the

03:13:49.584 --> 03:13:50.919
application for an is nothing

03:13:50.986 --> 03:13:54.022
for me get I believe that with

03:13:54.089 --> 03:13:55.757
the state being in the driver's

03:13:55.824 --> 03:13:58.493
seat that effort -- I want

03:13:58.560 --> 03:14:00.028
speaker CVD in this case but

03:14:00.095 --> 03:14:02.630
certainly from our perspective

03:14:02.697 --> 03:14:05.033
it is far more favorable to be

03:14:05.100 --> 03:14:07.168
able to be full participants

03:14:07.235 --> 03:14:09.971
in that application process

03:14:10.038 --> 03:14:11.306
having the confidence to know

03:14:11.373 --> 03:14:13.008
that having worked with the

03:14:13.074 --> 03:14:15.610
state they want the commercial

03:14:15.677 --> 03:14:17.178
fishery to be part of this

03:14:17.245 --> 03:14:20.782
process and I think it we've

03:14:20.849 --> 03:14:22.617
heard it from the feds we've

03:14:22.684 --> 03:14:23.718
heard it from the state

03:14:23.785 --> 03:14:25.186
certainly from scientists and

03:14:25.253 --> 03:14:26.488
folks who work at the working

03:14:26.554 --> 03:14:29.157
group at the working group is

03:14:29.224 --> 03:14:31.826
a superior option that it is

03:14:31.893 --> 03:14:33.828
the format by which in this

03:14:33.895 --> 03:14:35.096
fishery in potential in the

03:14:35.163 --> 03:14:36.798
west coast regionally we will

03:14:36.865 --> 03:14:38.066
best be able to address these

03:14:38.133 --> 03:14:41.436
challenges so I I think I'm

03:14:41.503 --> 03:14:43.138
curious to see next steps in

03:14:43.204 --> 03:14:45.373
the process but it you know at

03:14:45.440 --> 03:14:46.708
this point I'm confident in the

03:14:46.775 --> 03:14:49.010
state's strategy here and --

03:14:49.077 --> 03:14:50.178
we look forward to working with

03:14:50.245 --> 03:14:51.479
our friends and see if that we

03:14:51.546 --> 03:14:52.947
on this of selling a lot more

03:14:53.014 --> 03:14:55.383
work to come percent thank you

03:14:55.450 --> 03:14:57.419
and yeah and I don't have much

03:14:57.485 --> 03:15:00.055
more to to add but I I I would

03:15:00.121 --> 03:15:02.190
note that we do see promise

03:15:02.257 --> 03:15:04.159
in in the in the ramp program

03:15:04.225 --> 03:15:06.227
but we do you really want to

03:15:06.294 --> 03:15:08.630
see science bees management

03:15:08.696 --> 03:15:10.432
measures that significantly

03:15:10.498 --> 03:15:12.167
reduce the risk of entanglement

03:15:12.233 --> 03:15:14.302
and do so very quickly it's

03:15:14.369 --> 03:15:15.970
unfortunate that we're now

03:15:16.037 --> 03:15:17.505
talking about this the end

03:15:17.572 --> 03:15:19.040
of of twenty eighteen when we

03:15:19.107 --> 03:15:20.542
were first raising this issue

03:15:20.608 --> 03:15:22.143
and in twenty eight twenty

03:15:22.210 --> 03:15:23.978
fourteen and that the amount

03:15:24.045 --> 03:15:25.814
of time it's taken us to get

03:15:25.880 --> 03:15:28.049
to to this point it's been too

03:15:28.116 --> 03:15:29.551
long particularly when you're

03:15:29.617 --> 03:15:31.019
talking about the populations

03:15:31.086 --> 03:15:32.220
that we are the wheels just

03:15:32.287 --> 03:15:34.055
don't have time to wait nor nor

03:15:34.122 --> 03:15:35.590
should pay the state really has

03:15:35.657 --> 03:15:37.559
a legal and moral obligation

03:15:37.625 --> 03:15:39.561
to step up and really make

03:15:39.627 --> 03:15:40.895
some significant changes but

03:15:40.962 --> 03:15:42.397
also a great opportunity to

03:15:42.464 --> 03:15:44.833
do so as has been reiterated

03:15:44.899 --> 03:15:46.935
today several times thank you

03:15:47.001 --> 03:15:48.536
so like you very very grateful

03:15:48.603 --> 03:15:49.637
thank you for your comments

03:15:49.704 --> 03:15:51.172
thank you both for being here

03:15:51.239 --> 03:15:52.273
truly appreciate your work

03:15:52.340 --> 03:15:53.575
and know that there's more

03:15:53.641 --> 03:15:54.876
to come on this one thank you

03:15:54.943 --> 03:15:57.212
so much both you not to be

03:15:57.278 --> 03:15:58.379
moving on to public comment

03:15:58.446 --> 03:15:59.314
we're gonna invite anyone

03:15:59.380 --> 03:16:00.115
and everyone to be able to

03:16:00.181 --> 03:16:01.182
come up and offer any public

03:16:01.249 --> 03:16:02.450
comment -- here if you could

03:16:02.517 --> 03:16:03.852
step up to the microphone

03:16:03.918 --> 03:16:08.790
here two minutes okay

03:16:08.857 --> 03:16:09.991
the wind is given is your first

03:16:10.058 --> 03:16:11.493
name in your organization we

03:16:11.559 --> 03:16:13.328
welcome you Sir good afternoon

03:16:13.394 --> 03:16:15.597
chairman and co chair -- my

03:16:15.663 --> 03:16:17.098
name's James McFarlane I'm

03:16:17.165 --> 03:16:18.800
with the a marine of Tasmania

03:16:18.867 --> 03:16:21.136
Australia and I'd like to thank

03:16:21.202 --> 03:16:22.871
all of the fishers who have

03:16:22.937 --> 03:16:23.972
gone out and worked with us

03:16:24.038 --> 03:16:26.841
in the original test programs

03:16:26.908 --> 03:16:28.343
I'd offer up couple couple

03:16:28.409 --> 03:16:29.711
starts to go with my written

03:16:29.777 --> 03:16:32.947
notes -- one is everything you

03:16:33.014 --> 03:16:34.649
put over the side of the boat

03:16:34.716 --> 03:16:37.318
is mission driven and those

03:16:37.385 --> 03:16:39.120
pieces of equipment all have

03:16:39.187 --> 03:16:42.123
different uses and so reckless

03:16:42.190 --> 03:16:44.759
gears and the answer by itself

03:16:44.826 --> 03:16:47.095
GPS tracking by itself is not

03:16:47.162 --> 03:16:49.230
the answer -- the numbers of

03:16:49.297 --> 03:16:51.399
entanglements globally are

03:16:51.466 --> 03:16:52.567
three hundred thousand that's

03:16:52.634 --> 03:16:53.568
the global number that they're

03:16:53.635 --> 03:16:55.336
putting forth right now so

03:16:55.403 --> 03:16:57.105
it's not just a California --

03:16:57.172 --> 03:16:59.474
problems like you said we don't

03:16:59.541 --> 03:17:01.776
have -- boundaries and so forth

03:17:01.843 --> 03:17:02.977
as the global temperatures

03:17:03.044 --> 03:17:04.913
change in the ocean the fishing

03:17:04.979 --> 03:17:06.614
grounds are gonna change server

03:17:06.681 --> 03:17:08.283
the feeding grounds and so we

03:17:08.349 --> 03:17:09.817
do have these conflicts between

03:17:09.884 --> 03:17:11.953
the mammals and and the fishers

03:17:12.020 --> 03:17:13.555
I mean it's it's of no one no

03:17:13.621 --> 03:17:14.722
one problem and it's going to

03:17:14.789 --> 03:17:16.424
keep going on until we find

03:17:16.491 --> 03:17:18.126
solutions what we would like

03:17:18.193 --> 03:17:20.595
to -- hope is that we can work

03:17:20.662 --> 03:17:22.463
together to the system finding

03:17:22.530 --> 03:17:24.699
solutions for this and offer up

03:17:24.766 --> 03:17:26.834
the following Jeff -- Chester

03:17:26.901 --> 03:17:28.736
mentioned in his presentation

03:17:28.803 --> 03:17:30.872
six bows with five traps each

03:17:30.939 --> 03:17:32.674
to go into a an operational

03:17:32.740 --> 03:17:34.676
pilot test program there's two

03:17:34.742 --> 03:17:36.311
hundred thousand traps off the

03:17:36.377 --> 03:17:38.213
coast of California annually

03:17:38.279 --> 03:17:39.647
so we're talking about putting

03:17:39.714 --> 03:17:41.616
thirty robust gear and to try

03:17:41.683 --> 03:17:43.017
and find out what the problems

03:17:43.084 --> 03:17:44.185
are because I heard from a

03:17:44.252 --> 03:17:45.954
number of presenters that we

03:17:46.020 --> 03:17:48.323
don't have the data to make --

03:17:48.389 --> 03:17:49.757
informed decisions as to what

03:17:49.824 --> 03:17:51.659
the right way forward is and

03:17:51.726 --> 03:17:54.329
so -- here would love to help

03:17:54.395 --> 03:17:56.097
-- I think a big job in front

03:17:56.164 --> 03:17:58.266
of you and I think that the

03:17:58.333 --> 03:17:59.867
ongoing conversation between

03:17:59.934 --> 03:18:01.169
all of the interested parties

03:18:01.236 --> 03:18:02.503
is in the best interest of

03:18:02.570 --> 03:18:04.272
the state and that the wheels

03:18:04.339 --> 03:18:05.306
that are here thank you so

03:18:05.373 --> 03:18:07.208
much thank you for being here

03:18:07.275 --> 03:18:08.243
afternoon thank you bring

03:18:08.309 --> 03:18:09.244
in with this first last name

03:18:09.310 --> 03:18:10.578
organization thank you again

03:18:10.645 --> 03:18:12.380
for your time thank you so much

03:18:12.447 --> 03:18:14.148
-- senator McGuire and assembly

03:18:14.215 --> 03:18:16.117
member stone for having this

03:18:16.184 --> 03:18:17.518
wonderful hearing today for

03:18:17.585 --> 03:18:18.953
low everyone speak my name is

03:18:19.020 --> 03:18:20.488
Leah Sturgis I'm speaking on

03:18:20.555 --> 03:18:21.689
behalf of social compassionate

03:18:21.756 --> 03:18:23.758
legislation and I did the

03:18:23.825 --> 03:18:25.493
presentation I presented the

03:18:25.560 --> 03:18:27.095
power point on will and see

03:18:27.161 --> 03:18:28.263
totaling tangle men at the

03:18:28.329 --> 03:18:29.464
budget subcommittee where the

03:18:29.530 --> 03:18:30.565
seven point five million in

03:18:30.632 --> 03:18:31.666
funds were appropriated to

03:18:31.733 --> 03:18:33.868
the OPC -- and much of the

03:18:33.935 --> 03:18:35.036
discussion was focused on

03:18:35.103 --> 03:18:36.537
funding large larger scale

03:18:36.604 --> 03:18:38.139
testing a robust gear and other

03:18:38.206 --> 03:18:40.108
innovations the testimony that

03:18:40.174 --> 03:18:41.209
day was focused on presenting

03:18:41.276 --> 03:18:43.244
rebels technology as a solution

03:18:43.311 --> 03:18:44.512
and the conversation is what

03:18:44.579 --> 03:18:45.947
prompted the unit unanimous

03:18:46.014 --> 03:18:47.682
approval of the budget

03:18:47.749 --> 03:18:49.517
subcommittee so it was really

03:18:49.584 --> 03:18:52.186
focused on tack in science

03:18:52.253 --> 03:18:53.721
-- and so I feel there's no

03:18:53.788 --> 03:18:54.722
doubt that the best solution

03:18:54.789 --> 03:18:55.790
here will come from science

03:18:55.857 --> 03:18:57.425
and technology technological

03:18:57.492 --> 03:18:59.761
innovations afters considerable

03:18:59.827 --> 03:19:01.229
investigation into this issue

03:19:01.296 --> 03:19:03.331
I feel conceptually row plus

03:19:03.398 --> 03:19:04.532
options are the only way to

03:19:04.599 --> 03:19:06.200
eliminate risk of entanglement

03:19:06.267 --> 03:19:07.869
and insensitive feeding areas

03:19:07.935 --> 03:19:08.936
while allowing fishermen to

03:19:09.003 --> 03:19:11.039
continue to make a living --

03:19:11.105 --> 03:19:12.073
I also want to stress the dire

03:19:12.140 --> 03:19:13.474
situation of the sea turtles

03:19:13.541 --> 03:19:14.475
are facing we don't get the

03:19:14.542 --> 03:19:16.678
same price as the whales but

03:19:16.744 --> 03:19:17.578
their situation is actually

03:19:17.645 --> 03:19:19.013
more critical and I'd like

03:19:19.080 --> 03:19:19.981
to urge the committee to

03:19:20.048 --> 03:19:21.316
make sure that funding be set

03:19:21.382 --> 03:19:23.751
aside for Scott Benson here

03:19:23.818 --> 03:19:25.186
at no and moss landing marine

03:19:25.253 --> 03:19:26.587
laboratories so he can continue

03:19:26.654 --> 03:19:28.690
to do his necessary serving

03:19:28.756 --> 03:19:29.957
and tracking of the sea turtles

03:19:30.024 --> 03:19:30.992
which is incredibly important

03:19:31.059 --> 03:19:32.760
at this time the circles come

03:19:32.827 --> 03:19:34.095
all the way from Indonesia to

03:19:34.162 --> 03:19:35.763
feed in the Monterey Bay so

03:19:35.830 --> 03:19:37.298
at least we can let them for

03:19:37.365 --> 03:19:38.800
is there safely thank you so

03:19:38.866 --> 03:19:40.034
much because which these pretty

03:19:40.101 --> 03:19:41.703
amazing to think though about

03:19:41.769 --> 03:19:43.504
their journey right in but it

03:19:43.571 --> 03:19:45.506
takes absolutely thank you so

03:19:45.573 --> 03:19:46.407
much we're grateful you're here

03:19:46.474 --> 03:19:48.009
today please get your first

03:19:48.076 --> 03:19:49.377
and last and your organization

03:19:49.444 --> 03:19:50.411
we're grateful you're here

03:19:50.478 --> 03:19:51.979
shore -- Nicholas Sackett

03:19:52.046 --> 03:19:53.448
director of legislative affairs

03:19:53.514 --> 03:19:54.916
for social question legislation

03:19:54.982 --> 03:19:57.185
as well thinking not just once

03:19:57.251 --> 03:19:59.354
a simply -- point out that

03:19:59.420 --> 03:20:00.955
my organizations presentation

03:20:01.022 --> 03:20:02.357
which was done by Leah on

03:20:02.423 --> 03:20:03.925
April twenty third in front

03:20:03.991 --> 03:20:05.126
of the budget sub committee

03:20:05.193 --> 03:20:07.195
chaired by some members bloom

03:20:07.261 --> 03:20:08.129
and where assemblymember

03:20:08.196 --> 03:20:09.530
Tang is an alternate focus

03:20:09.597 --> 03:20:10.865
solely on -- entanglement

03:20:10.932 --> 03:20:12.367
issues and the possibility

03:20:12.433 --> 03:20:13.468
of reducing doesn't hang

03:20:13.534 --> 03:20:14.669
with with the use of reverse

03:20:14.736 --> 03:20:16.804
gear and other technologies

03:20:16.871 --> 03:20:18.306
after a presentation on four

03:20:18.373 --> 03:20:20.375
twenty three the subcommittee

03:20:20.441 --> 03:20:21.676
unanimously voted to approve

03:20:21.743 --> 03:20:22.844
the seven point five million

03:20:22.910 --> 03:20:24.379
dollars are allocated for him

03:20:24.445 --> 03:20:26.914
issues on may twenty second

03:20:26.981 --> 03:20:28.649
we fully understand that those

03:20:28.716 --> 03:20:29.984
funds were not specifically

03:20:30.051 --> 03:20:31.319
earmarked for broke with

03:20:31.386 --> 03:20:33.154
testing but it's important

03:20:33.221 --> 03:20:34.355
for all the stakeholders

03:20:34.422 --> 03:20:35.757
including OPC in the working

03:20:35.823 --> 03:20:36.657
group to understand the

03:20:36.724 --> 03:20:37.859
spirit in which those funds

03:20:37.925 --> 03:20:40.628
are allocated -- we believe

03:20:40.695 --> 03:20:41.796
that the people of California

03:20:41.863 --> 03:20:43.865
would be disappointed to know

03:20:43.931 --> 03:20:45.867
that a method by which --

03:20:45.933 --> 03:20:47.769
the fishery could thrive with

03:20:47.835 --> 03:20:49.036
zero entanglements with the

03:20:49.103 --> 03:20:50.471
use of reckless gear was not

03:20:50.538 --> 03:20:52.106
at least tested by the state

03:20:52.173 --> 03:20:55.143
if not outright advocate for

03:20:55.209 --> 03:20:56.878
-- are asking is that the --

03:20:56.944 --> 03:21:00.047
PC -- will commit to a robust

03:21:00.114 --> 03:21:01.549
operational testing plan for

03:21:01.616 --> 03:21:03.584
next season -- and to make

03:21:03.651 --> 03:21:05.119
that commitment immediately so

03:21:05.186 --> 03:21:06.921
that there is time to set up

03:21:06.988 --> 03:21:08.790
a scientifically operationally

03:21:08.856 --> 03:21:11.292
sound testing plan thanks

03:21:11.359 --> 03:21:12.293
thank you so much thank you for

03:21:12.360 --> 03:21:13.961

name is don't complain and I

03:21:23.438 --> 03:21:24.672
am a commercial fisherman from

03:21:24.739 --> 03:21:25.706
half moon bay and have been

03:21:25.773 --> 03:21:27.775
for forty six years it up I

03:21:27.842 --> 03:21:29.143
would like to thank you for the

03:21:29.210 --> 03:21:31.279
opportunity to speak here today

03:21:31.345 --> 03:21:32.780
and I would also like to is it

03:21:32.847 --> 03:21:35.149
too thank you senator McGuire

03:21:35.216 --> 03:21:36.984
in the committee for the

03:21:37.051 --> 03:21:39.320
due diligence that -- you've

03:21:39.387 --> 03:21:41.756
exhibited towards working

03:21:41.823 --> 03:21:43.524
two viable solutions to the

03:21:43.591 --> 03:21:45.827
problems involving demo casted

03:21:45.893 --> 03:21:48.529
and willing paying with that

03:21:48.596 --> 03:21:50.498
that still maintain focus on

03:21:50.565 --> 03:21:55.536
vibrant sustainable fisheries

03:21:55.603 --> 03:21:58.673
--

03:21:58.739 --> 03:21:59.941
it's it's important to

03:22:00.007 --> 03:22:02.677
commercial fisherman

03:22:02.743 --> 03:22:05.880
how important it is to -- to

03:22:05.947 --> 03:22:07.615
maintain a healthy Ocean for

03:22:07.682 --> 03:22:09.417
all of its inhabitants in

03:22:09.484 --> 03:22:11.452
fact I think it's fair to say

03:22:11.519 --> 03:22:14.722
that we would have we have a

03:22:14.789 --> 03:22:16.357
little patch of green on all

03:22:16.424 --> 03:22:18.493
of this when it concerns to

03:22:18.559 --> 03:22:20.895
the ocean our ocean activities

03:22:20.962 --> 03:22:23.064
we just keep it well hidden

03:22:23.130 --> 03:22:24.832
but where the rubber meets

03:22:24.899 --> 03:22:27.368
the road through -- efforts

03:22:27.435 --> 03:22:29.837
of Noah and sick before him PC

03:22:29.904 --> 03:22:31.806
effort say the working group

03:22:31.873 --> 03:22:35.176
it cetera -- it's it should be

03:22:35.243 --> 03:22:39.447
clear that when it comes to the

03:22:39.514 --> 03:22:41.048
rubber meeting the road we've

03:22:41.115 --> 03:22:42.416
always been the first to step

03:22:42.483 --> 03:22:44.151
up to the plate and take the

03:22:44.218 --> 03:22:46.954
necessary steps the leaders to

03:22:47.021 --> 03:22:49.757
productive full co existence

03:22:49.824 --> 03:22:51.158
on the ocean with all of its

03:22:51.225 --> 03:22:53.461
inhabitants thank you thank you

03:22:53.528 --> 03:22:54.862
so much thank you for coming

03:22:54.929 --> 03:22:56.764
over today as well retrievals

03:22:56.831 --> 03:22:58.332
good to see you good afternoon

03:22:58.399 --> 03:22:59.433
hereby give us your first and

03:22:59.500 --> 03:23:00.601
last year musician it's good

03:23:00.668 --> 03:23:01.736
to see you experiment thank

03:23:01.802 --> 03:23:03.871
you things for the sun -- my

03:23:03.938 --> 03:23:06.040
name's John Miller I'm a member

03:23:06.107 --> 03:23:07.608
of the SF traveled owners

03:23:07.675 --> 03:23:10.077
association yeah also a member

03:23:10.144 --> 03:23:13.381
of the working group yeah I've

03:23:13.447 --> 03:23:14.949
been fishing for forty years I

03:23:15.016 --> 03:23:17.385
started when I was fifteen or

03:23:17.451 --> 03:23:20.454
so -- I think the the exciting

03:23:20.521 --> 03:23:22.657
thing about -- you know are

03:23:22.723 --> 03:23:24.392
working group in this -- ramp

03:23:24.458 --> 03:23:27.228
program specifically is just

03:23:27.295 --> 03:23:29.263
the idea that fishermen can be

03:23:29.330 --> 03:23:31.098
involved in our own governments

03:23:31.165 --> 03:23:33.301
so it's not like it or coming

03:23:33.367 --> 03:23:34.702
to you and saying okay give us

03:23:34.769 --> 03:23:36.971
a solution I think ultimately

03:23:37.038 --> 03:23:37.805
you know with the aid of

03:23:37.872 --> 03:23:40.074
technology and -- you know all

03:23:40.141 --> 03:23:42.176
these innovations and so forth

03:23:42.243 --> 03:23:43.544
ultimately the solutions out

03:23:43.611 --> 03:23:44.679
to come from the fishermen's

03:23:44.745 --> 03:23:46.314
selves because if it doesn't

03:23:46.380 --> 03:23:48.382
work for us result in a go

03:23:48.449 --> 03:23:50.017
out of business in your house

03:23:50.084 --> 03:23:51.619
vision ports with no picture

03:23:51.686 --> 03:23:55.890
more and you know its -- that's

03:23:55.957 --> 03:23:58.459
a terrible thing to imagine for

03:23:58.526 --> 03:24:00.895
so many different reasons so I

03:24:00.962 --> 03:24:03.130
think it -- you know we're used

03:24:03.197 --> 03:24:05.132
to a sort of more heavy handed

03:24:05.199 --> 03:24:08.469
top down style management --

03:24:08.536 --> 03:24:09.870
coming from the agencies and

03:24:09.937 --> 03:24:11.439
stuff and this is completely

03:24:11.505 --> 03:24:14.075
different so because of that

03:24:14.141 --> 03:24:15.476
I think you get a lot of by

03:24:15.543 --> 03:24:17.144
incomplete because it has a lot

03:24:17.211 --> 03:24:18.913
of credibility with the flea

03:24:18.980 --> 03:24:21.515
and I think people are gonna

03:24:21.582 --> 03:24:22.783
try a lot harder and racked

03:24:22.850 --> 03:24:23.851
their brains to come up with

03:24:23.918 --> 03:24:26.754
solutions and to actually see

03:24:26.821 --> 03:24:30.691
it through and make it work so

03:24:30.758 --> 03:24:31.859
thank you tell the to taking

03:24:31.926 --> 03:24:33.527
time Sir in forty years that's

03:24:33.594 --> 03:24:36.230
fantastic yeah I think thank

03:24:42.503 --> 03:24:44.138
last organization my first name

is Catherine last name is quick

03:24:45.606 --> 03:24:48.209
were -- a and been working for

03:24:48.275 --> 03:24:49.577
several months pro bono with

03:24:49.644 --> 03:24:51.512
a start up company in Halifax

03:24:51.579 --> 03:24:54.115
Nova Scotia that is developing

03:24:54.181 --> 03:24:55.783
a real close fishing solution

03:24:55.850 --> 03:24:58.686
with GPS tracking and what

03:24:58.753 --> 03:24:59.754
I'd like to let you know is

03:24:59.820 --> 03:25:01.656
that the government of Canada

03:25:01.722 --> 03:25:02.723
department of fisheries and

03:25:02.790 --> 03:25:06.427
oceans has provided funding to

03:25:06.494 --> 03:25:08.195
fishing associations to conduct

03:25:08.262 --> 03:25:11.065
pilot testing of this and other

03:25:11.132 --> 03:25:13.501
similar technologies and I I

03:25:13.567 --> 03:25:15.136
really like that because it's

03:25:15.202 --> 03:25:17.038
not just come the government

03:25:17.104 --> 03:25:18.372
funding the company directly

03:25:18.439 --> 03:25:20.007
but it's funding association to

03:25:20.074 --> 03:25:21.375
get their members to take the

03:25:21.442 --> 03:25:23.577
boats out and test equipment

03:25:23.644 --> 03:25:25.346
and get really good feedback

03:25:25.413 --> 03:25:26.714
from the fishermen whether it

03:25:26.781 --> 03:25:28.349
works for them or not it has

03:25:28.416 --> 03:25:29.950
to work for them and has to fit

03:25:30.017 --> 03:25:32.486
on the deck the stackable allow

03:25:32.553 --> 03:25:33.521
them to get the stuff in the

03:25:33.587 --> 03:25:34.755
water without taking a fishing

03:25:34.822 --> 03:25:36.090
gloves off and everything else

03:25:36.157 --> 03:25:38.292
I have to deal with so I think

03:25:38.359 --> 03:25:40.294
I would like to see of funding

03:25:40.361 --> 03:25:42.263
solution in California that

03:25:42.329 --> 03:25:45.366
does something similar piloting

03:25:45.433 --> 03:25:46.934

map as we move forward in two

03:27:02.910 --> 03:27:04.512
thousand nineteen within the

03:27:04.578 --> 03:27:05.746
first quarter of two thousand

03:27:05.813 --> 03:27:06.714
nineteen we're going to be

03:27:06.781 --> 03:27:08.015
having hearing on offshore

03:27:08.082 --> 03:27:10.184
wind there are several projects

03:27:10.251 --> 03:27:11.318
off the state of California

03:27:11.385 --> 03:27:12.686
that maybe dancing offshore

03:27:12.753 --> 03:27:14.488
wind we want to make sure that

03:27:14.555 --> 03:27:16.123
fisheries are natural resources

03:27:16.190 --> 03:27:17.758
are protected while also being

03:27:17.825 --> 03:27:19.126
-- provide that green energy

03:27:19.193 --> 03:27:21.462
that the state station needs

03:27:21.529 --> 03:27:22.997
to will be hosting a hearing on

03:27:23.063 --> 03:27:24.098
that within the first quarter

03:27:24.165 --> 03:27:25.833
of two thousand nineteen will

03:27:25.900 --> 03:27:27.234
be following up on this issue

03:27:27.301 --> 03:27:28.836
of wailing tangle me as well

03:27:28.903 --> 03:27:30.571
as ship strikes here in two

03:27:30.638 --> 03:27:32.807
thousand nineteen as well with

03:27:32.873 --> 03:27:33.741
the understanding that there

03:27:33.808 --> 03:27:35.209
is a lady active litigation

03:27:35.276 --> 03:27:36.443
is being that will be moving

03:27:36.510 --> 03:27:38.479
forward -- and we're hoping

03:27:38.546 --> 03:27:39.547
that there's gonna be some type

03:27:39.613 --> 03:27:41.582
of settlement I do not know

03:27:41.649 --> 03:27:42.883
anything that you don't know

03:27:42.950 --> 03:27:44.485
and I don't have a crystal ball

03:27:44.552 --> 03:27:46.120
-- area and -- what I would

03:27:46.187 --> 03:27:47.721
hope is that bottom line is

03:27:47.788 --> 03:27:49.323
this we need to ensure that

03:27:49.390 --> 03:27:50.691
we're protecting California's

03:27:50.758 --> 03:27:53.327
majestic well population in

03:27:53.394 --> 03:27:54.862
to be able to allow the crab

03:27:54.929 --> 03:27:56.463
fishery to thrive in the years

03:27:56.530 --> 03:27:58.132
to come I think that we can

03:27:58.199 --> 03:27:59.767
have both -- in it's gonna

03:27:59.834 --> 03:28:01.335
take compromise on all sides

03:28:01.402 --> 03:28:03.070
be able to do so I to better

03:28:03.137 --> 03:28:04.872
protect that well population

03:28:04.939 --> 03:28:06.674
as well as a hard working men

03:28:06.740 --> 03:28:08.042
and women in the fleet and I

03:28:08.108 --> 03:28:08.976
am confident that we're gonna

03:28:09.043 --> 03:28:10.611
be able to get there but I do

03:28:10.678 --> 03:28:11.445
know that there's going to have

03:28:11.512 --> 03:28:13.848
to be at some additional focus

03:28:13.914 --> 03:28:15.683
that focus is gonna be detailed

03:28:15.749 --> 03:28:18.018
in additional funding at the

03:28:18.085 --> 03:28:19.386
state needs to be able to step

03:28:19.453 --> 03:28:21.355
up and assist -- not just that

03:28:21.422 --> 03:28:22.890
hundred thousand dollars and

03:28:22.957 --> 03:28:26.493
on going -- -- allocation we

03:28:26.560 --> 03:28:28.062
need to be able to step up on

03:28:28.128 --> 03:28:29.096
more than a hundred thousand

03:28:29.163 --> 03:28:31.498
dollars -- every year on well

03:28:31.565 --> 03:28:33.167
tangle but no that's gonna

03:28:33.234 --> 03:28:34.368
be budget discussion but

03:28:34.435 --> 03:28:35.903
more to come number two on

03:28:35.970 --> 03:28:37.605

03:28:37.671 --> 03:28:38.739
health we have to find the

03:28:38.806 --> 03:28:39.640
department of public health

03:28:39.707 --> 03:28:41.609
when it comes to testing on

03:28:41.675 --> 03:28:43.544
that issue we will not get into

03:28:43.611 --> 03:28:45.579
was cut out of the budget was

03:28:45.646 --> 03:28:46.981
recommended by the legislature

03:28:47.047 --> 03:28:49.216
by two years ago on the and

03:28:49.283 --> 03:28:51.051
incredibly frustrating that

03:28:51.118 --> 03:28:52.186
said we're gonna be going back

03:28:52.253 --> 03:28:54.154

03:28:54.221 --> 03:28:55.556
work with the administration

03:28:55.623 --> 03:28:57.157
to be successful this year

03:28:57.224 --> 03:28:58.726

03:28:58.792 --> 03:28:59.760
for department public health

03:28:59.827 --> 03:29:02.096

03:29:02.162 --> 03:29:05.766

03:29:05.833 --> 03:29:07.234
at fish wildlife to we didn't

03:29:07.301 --> 03:29:08.836
