A PROPOSAL.

01:52:52.065 --> 01:52:57.738 region:rollup2
THAT MAKES THAT CHANGE AT THIS

01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:59.573 region:rollup2
THAT THE STE.

01:52:57.738 --> 01:53:01.041 region:rollup2
I ALSO WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING

01:52:59.573 --> 01:53:04.311 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S BEEN LOTS OF

01:53:01.041 --> 01:53:07.114 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION THERE'S BEEN LOTS OF

01:53:04.311 --> 01:53:08.682 region:rollup2
REGARDING THE LANGUAGE AND IF

01:53:07.114 --> 01:53:10.250 region:rollup2
GOD AMENDMENT IS TAKEN AT THIS

01:53:08.682 --> 01:53:14.021 region:rollup2
LIGHT LATE OUR I WILL NOT

01:53:10.250 --> 01:53:15.322 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THIS.

01:53:14.021 --> 01:53:16.490 region:rollup2
HE OTHER DISCUSSION YEAH I

01:53:15.322 --> 01:53:18.325 region:rollup2
THOUGHT I'D LIKE OTHER JUST

01:53:16.490 --> 01:53:19.359 region:rollup2
POSIT THAT.

01:53:18.325 --> 01:53:21.294 region:rollup2
YOU NO GIVEN ALL THE CONDITIONS

01:53:19.359 --> 01:53:22.362 region:rollup2
HERE -- IT

01:53:21.294 --> 01:53:23.897 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T REALLY MAKE A

01:53:22.362 --> 01:53:24.898 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE BECAUSE YOU CAN FIX

01:53:23.897 --> 01:53:28.068 region:rollup2
OR EXCLUDE ANYTHING USING THE

01:53:24.898 --> 01:53:28.368 region:rollup2
VARIOUS FACTORS THAT ARE THERE

01:53:28.068 --> 01:53:30.370 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:53:28.368 --> 01:53:31.638 region:rollup2
SO -- I I

01:53:30.370 --> 01:53:33.173 region:rollup2
KNOW WE'RE HAVING A BIG DISPUTE

01:53:31.638 --> 01:53:34.474 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT AT THIS TIME I AT THIS

01:53:33.173 --> 01:53:35.342 region:rollup2
HOUR.

01:53:34.474 --> 01:53:37.144 region:rollup2
AND I'M NOT PARTICULARLY HAPPY

01:53:35.342 --> 01:53:40.113 region:rollup2
WITH THIS WHOLE PROCESS BUT I

01:53:37.144 --> 01:53:42.849 region:rollup2
THINK AT THIS POINT IN TIME --

01:53:40.113 --> 01:53:45.519 region:rollup2
IT MAY I WAS.

01:53:42.849 --> 01:53:47.421 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW YOU SAY --

01:53:45.519 --> 01:53:49.456 region:rollup2
IS A MORE FLEXIBLE APPROACH AND

01:53:47.421 --> 01:53:50.924 region:rollup2
SO I WILL I WILL NOT SUPPORT THE

01:53:49.456 --> 01:53:52.526 region:rollup2
CHANGE IN THE MEMBER BUT I WOULD

01:53:50.924 --> 01:53:54.027 region:rollup2
LIKE TO EMPHASIZE.

01:53:52.526 --> 01:53:55.429 region:rollup2
THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE A NUMBER

01:53:54.027 --> 01:53:57.264 region:rollup2
OF DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT CAN BE

01:53:55.429 --> 01:53:59.433 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED.

01:53:57.264 --> 01:54:01.968 region:rollup2
THIS DOES IN FACT GIVE THE

01:53:59.433 --> 01:54:04.638 region:rollup2
DETERMINING BODY AN OPPORTUNITY

01:54:01.968 --> 01:54:05.972 region:rollup2
TO MAKE VALUE JUDGMENTS --

01:54:04.638 --> 01:54:07.374 region:rollup2
THAT --

01:54:05.972 --> 01:54:09.309 region:rollup2
WHETHER YOU USE THE WORD SHALL

01:54:07.374 --> 01:54:11.011 region:rollup2
OR USE THE WORD MAY IF YOU HAVE

01:54:09.309 --> 01:54:12.279 region:rollup2
THE WORD SHALL.

01:54:11.011 --> 01:54:14.147 region:rollup2
AND IT'S AS WELL THEY HAVE TO DO

01:54:12.279 --> 01:54:14.715 region:rollup2
IT IF THEY FIND THESE TWELVE

01:54:14.147 --> 01:54:15.949 region:rollup2
FACTORS.

01:54:14.715 --> 01:54:17.317 region:rollup2
THEY COULD EASILY SAY WELL WE

01:54:15.949 --> 01:54:18.719 region:rollup2
DON'T REALLY WANT TO DO THAT SO

01:54:17.317 --> 01:54:20.620 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT GONNA FIND IN THOSE

01:54:18.719 --> 01:54:22.022 region:rollup2
TWELVE FACTOR SO I'M NOT SURE

01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:23.223 region:rollup2
YOU REALLY ACCOMPLISHING.

01:54:22.022 --> 01:54:24.725 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU WANT HERE THAT'S MY

01:54:23.223 --> 01:54:26.226 region:rollup2
LAWYER HAPPENED FOR YOU KNOW

01:54:24.725 --> 01:54:27.327 region:rollup2
THIS JOB DOESN'T PAY ENOUGH ON

01:54:26.226 --> 01:54:28.595 region:rollup2
THE HOURLY RATE THAT A LAWYER

01:54:27.327 --> 01:54:30.030 region:rollup2
WOULD CHARGE SO?

01:54:28.595 --> 01:54:32.232 region:rollup2
DON'T HOLD ME TO THAT LEGAL

01:54:30.030 --> 01:54:34.935 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS BALUCHISTAN OFF THE TOP

01:54:32.232 --> 01:54:36.603 region:rollup2
MY AND MISTER CHAIR IF I CAN

01:54:34.935 --> 01:54:38.038 region:rollup2
JUST SPEAK TO IT.

01:54:36.603 --> 01:54:39.973 region:rollup2
RIGHT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING

01:54:38.038 --> 01:54:40.273 region:rollup2
THE GOAL OF THIS WAS TO PROVIDE

01:54:39.973 --> 01:54:41.808 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:54:40.273 --> 01:54:44.144 region:rollup2
SOME LEVEL.

01:54:41.808 --> 01:54:46.179 region:rollup2
OF CERTAINTY WITHOUT CREATING A

01:54:44.144 --> 01:54:48.181 region:rollup2
MORAL HAZARD.

01:54:46.179 --> 01:54:49.950 region:rollup2
AND WHILE I APPRECIATE ALL THE

01:54:48.181 --> 01:54:52.586 region:rollup2
WORK THAT IS BEING DONE THIS

01:54:49.950 --> 01:54:53.620 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE THAT WE GOT CAME TO US.

01:54:52.586 --> 01:54:55.188 region:rollup2
JUST MINUTES BEFORE THE

01:54:53.620 --> 01:54:56.690 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE IN FACT IS AS WE KNOW

01:54:55.188 --> 01:54:58.058 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE COMING IN AND

01:54:56.690 --> 01:54:59.626 region:rollup2
DROPPING LANGUAGE OFF NOW.

01:54:58.058 --> 01:55:01.361 region:rollup2
WE LIKE TO SPEAK OF A

01:54:59.626 --> 01:55:02.963 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENT PROCESS --

01:55:01.361 --> 01:55:04.431 region:rollup2
BUT AS A COMMITTEE NOT ONE TIME

01:55:02.963 --> 01:55:06.466 region:rollup2
HAVE WE EVER HAD A TRUE MARK UP

01:55:04.431 --> 01:55:07.601 region:rollup2
SESSION ON THIS TO FIND OUT

01:55:06.466 --> 01:55:09.002 region:rollup2
WHETHER THIS COMMITTEE A

01:55:07.601 --> 01:55:10.504 region:rollup2
MAJORITY OF THIS COMMITTEE

01:55:09.002 --> 01:55:11.571 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY APPROVE THE LANGUAGE

01:55:10.504 --> 01:55:14.641 region:rollup2
BEFORE US.

01:55:11.571 --> 01:55:16.409 region:rollup2
THE TRUTH IS THIS LANGUAGE WAS

01:55:14.641 --> 01:55:17.978 region:rollup2
DONE IN A BACK ROOM.

01:55:16.409 --> 01:55:20.547 region:rollup2
MY GUESS IS THIS LANGUAGE WAS

01:55:17.978 --> 01:55:22.282 region:rollup2
DONE BY STAFF WITHOUT MEMBER

01:55:20.547 --> 01:55:24.484 region:rollup2
IMPORT OR VERY LITTLE MEMBER

01:55:22.282 --> 01:55:25.986 region:rollup2
INPUT ON WHAT WAS BEFORE US THAT

01:55:24.484 --> 01:55:26.887 region:rollup2
IS INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING I

01:55:25.986 --> 01:55:28.021 region:rollup2
GOTTA TELL YOU.

01:55:26.887 --> 01:55:29.356 region:rollup2
AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL SOMEBODY

01:55:28.021 --> 01:55:31.725 region:rollup2
THAT SPENT.

01:55:29.356 --> 01:55:32.726 region:rollup2
AN ENTIRE OPEC ALMOST TO A LIFE

01:55:31.725 --> 01:55:34.761 region:rollup2
FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO RUN FOR

01:55:32.726 --> 01:55:37.030 region:rollup2
OFFICE TO CAMPAIGN TO COME UP

01:55:34.761 --> 01:55:38.765 region:rollup2
HERE AND I THINK THAT ON ELECTED

01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:40.434 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS ARE RIDING THIS

01:55:38.765 --> 01:55:41.668 region:rollup2
WITHOUT ANY ABILITY FOR US TO BE

01:55:40.434 --> 01:55:43.370 region:rollup2
ABLE TO OPINE.

01:55:41.668 --> 01:55:46.540 region:rollup2
AND THIS THE FIRST TIME I'VE

01:55:43.370 --> 01:55:48.308 region:rollup2
OFFERED UP LANGUAGE AND IT'S ONE

01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:51.411 region:rollup2
WORD FROM MAY. TO SHALL THAT

01:55:48.308 --> 01:55:53.146 region:rollup2
PROVIDES HIGHER LEVEL OF

01:55:51.411 --> 01:55:54.881 region:rollup2
CERTAINTY BEFORE THIS GETS THE

01:55:53.146 --> 01:55:58.985 region:rollup2
P. YOU SEE AND APPRECIATE A VOTE

01:55:54.881 --> 01:56:01.988 region:rollup2

01:55:58.985 --> 01:56:03.490 region:rollup2
IT'S REYES.

01:56:01.988 --> 01:56:04.925 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT STAFF

01:56:03.490 --> 01:56:06.593 region:rollup2
PREPARED THE FIRST DRAFT AND IT

01:56:04.925 --> 01:56:10.630 region:rollup2
WAS.

01:56:06.593 --> 01:56:12.299 region:rollup2
REFERRED TO AS THE STAFF DRAFT.

WANT TO CHANGE IS SOMETHING THAT

01:56:31.117 --> 01:56:37.557 region:rollup2
