STARTED I KNOW IF GOING TO HAVE. SOME COLLEAGUES JOINING US. BUT THIS WHEN I LOOK AT OUR AMAZING AGENDA. REALIZE THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL OF BEING A VERY LONG HEARING. IS WE HAVE A LOT TO GO OVER. SO WELCOME MY NAME IS MARK STONE I'M CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. AND THIS IS A HEARING THAT'S BEEN A LONG TIME IN PROCESS AND HOPEFULLY. GENERATING SOME [inaudible] INTEREST. TALKING ABOUT DIVERSITY AND THE TOPIC FIRST CAME WITH THE DISCUSSION AROUND DIVERSITY ON THE BENCH. DAD AND I THINK OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS WE'VE SEEN SOME IMPROVEMENT. AT ESPECIALLY WE HAVE A VERY DIVERSE TO BRING COURT RIGHT NOW. BUT IN LOOKING UP AND DOWN THE RANKS OF JUDGES ACROSS STATE MANY OF WHOM HAVE BEEN APPOINTED OVER THE LAST DECADES IN SOME QUITE SOMETIME AGO. I THINK WOULD REALLY HAD. AS FOR THE CLEAR. NOTION THAT WE HAVE SOME WORK TO DO WITH THE JUDICIARY BUT THAT RAISE QUESTIONS BECAUSE THE BAR IS OBVIOUSLY A PATH TO THE JUDICIARY ADD WHEN WE LOOK AT THE BAR. WE ALSO REALIZE THAT WE HAVE SOME STRUGGLES WITH DIVERSITY AND LAW FIRMS IN THE PROFESSION AND I THINK THE PROFESSION IN ORDER TO BE. TRULY RECOGNIZED AS BENEFICIAL TO CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO LOOK LIKE CALIFORNIA DOES. AND I'VE LOOKS BY ALL THE DATA THAT WE'VE COLLECTED IN THE DATA WE'RE GONNA SEE TODAY WERE A LONG WAY FROM THAT. WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY IN THE BAR WITHOUT TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY AT LAW SCHOOLS AND PIPELINE OF GETTING STUDENTS. THROUGH THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND INTO LAW SCHOOLS AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES THAT THAT REPRESENTS. WAS LEGISLATURE'S WORKING HARD TO TRY AND MAKE SURE WE ARE. EDUCATING ALL STUDENTS BUT GIVEN SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS GIVEN OTHER FACTORS RACIAL FACTORS WE KNOW THAT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA IS NOT EQUAL IN IS NOT EQUITABLE WHICH MEANS. THAT PROFESSIONS ARE ALSO NOT GOING TO HAVE OFFER THE SAME OPPORTUNITY AS EVERYONE ELSE. WE'RE ALSO GONNA BE DISK EXPLORING. OR TOUCHING ON A NUMBER OF NOTIONS AND POTENTIAL IMPEDIMENTS TO DIVERSITY IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION THINGS LIKE THE BAR CUT SCORE. THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS NO RECIPROCITY WITH OTHER STATES WE HAVE BECOME IN A WAY A BIT OF AN ISLAND ON OUR OWN THROUGH HISTORICAL REASONS. BUT I I THINK I HOPE THAT THROUGH THIS DISCUSSION AND OTHER DISCUSSIONS TO COME THIS IS SUCH A BROAD TOPIC AT THIS POINT. LET IT SERVICES. MORE OF AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ISSUES TO THE CHALLENGES -- A STATEMENT IF YOU WELL AND HOPEFULLY A GAUNTLET LAY DOWN. FOR ALL OF US TO TAKE OUR PART RESPONSIBLY FOR OUR PARTS OF ENSURING THAT WE ARE LOOKING ACROSS THE LEGAL PROFESSION FROM. THOSE IN SCHOOL NOW WHO WOULD SEEK TO BECOME ATTORNEYS TO THOSE WHO ARE ALL THE WAY UP BEING APPOINTED TO THE SUPREME COURT IN CALIFORNIA AND EVERYONE IN BETWEEN THAT WE ARE ALL TAKING OUR PART. IN ENSURING THAT WE ARE THINKING ABOUT LOOKING AT AND ASK OURSELVES THE QUESTION HOW CAN WE BEST ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE MOST DIVERSE BAR THE MOST REPRESENTATIVE BAR AND BENCH. FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIANS AND THAT MEANS THERE SHOULD BE NO ISSUES THAT WE ARE UNWILLING TO LOOK AT THESE THERE SHOULD BE NO ISSUES. THAT WE ARE UNWILLING TO TACKLE IN THAT QUEST I THINK THAT'S GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA AND GOOD. FOR THE THE LEGAL PROFESSION AS A WHOLE. SO WE HAVE QUITE A FEW PEOPLE THAT THE THE LIST ON THE AGENDA STARTED TO GET BIGGER AND BIGGER AS WE REALIZE THERE WERE MORE AND MORE QUESTIONS. WE NEEDED TO ASK [inaudible] AND INFORMATION AND EVEN QUESTIONS TO PUT ON THE TABLE SO I FORESEE SEVERAL. OPPORTUNITIES OVER THE COMING YEARS TO BE TALKING ABOUT THAT AS WELL HOPEFULLY SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. AND I'M ASSUMING WE'RE GOING TO BE RAISING A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT. GIVE US BETTER DIRECTION THE LEGISLATURE THE JUDICIAL BRANCH AND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO BE DOING A BETTER JOB WITH RESPECT SO WE'RE ASKING THAT SPEAKERS BE ABOUT SEVEN MINUTES OR SO I KNOW THAT THESE ARE JUDGES AND LAWYERS. ADD. THE WORST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD AND I SPEAK FOR MYSELF TO ASK TO BE BRIEF. BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE COVERING ALL OF THE GROUND ANSWERING ALL OF THE QUESTIONS OBVIOUSLY IN THIS HEARING. TO BE RESPECTFUL OF THE TIME OF THOSE ESPECIALLY ON THE PANELS. AFTER YOUR PANELS. IT'S I WILL TRY AND MAINTAIN SOME TIME BUT I WILL TELL YOU A VERY INTERESTED IN THIS TOPIC AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GIVE EVERYBODY THE CHANCE TO TALK. BUT THEN ALSO THE ELEMENT OPEN THIS UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT WE'VE GOT IT ALL SIGN UP LIST GOING. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SIGN UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IF YOU HAVEN'T SIGNED UP ON THAT LIST THAT WILL NOT PRECLUDE YOU FROM MAKING A PUBLIC COMMENT. BUT DEPENDING ON WHEN THAT STARTS THOSE MIGHT BE LIMITED TO FAIRLY SHORT STATEMENTS. WHICH I HATE TO DO BECAUSE GETTING PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT AT ALL THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY CRITICAL AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THIS IS THE ASSEMBLY. EIGHT IN AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING THE SOMEBODY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE BUT WE HAVE ALSO ASKED THE LEGISLATURE HAS A NUMBER OF ETHNIC CAUCUSES. THAT WE'VE INVITED TO JOIN US AND THE OUR IS A BIT EARLY I SUPPOSE. BUT THAT WE HAVE INVITED AT A NUMBER OF LEGISLATORS TO COME TO THE DIS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO HELP US WITH THIS. BECAUSE THE VARIOUS CAUCUSES THE API CAUCUS THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS LATINO CAUCUS. HAVE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF INSURING. THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS VERY COGNIZANT OF DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE WITH RESPECT TO RACE AND A SPECIAL. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT THIS LEGISLATURE TO EXPAND STRUGGLING WITH AND HAS BEEN GETTING GREAT GUIDANCE FROM THE GLBT CAUCUS. BECAUSE LET'S SAY WE HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN SENSITIVE TO THE THAT BRETT OF PEOPLE ACROSS CALIFORNIA WE'RE TRYING TO BE. MUCH BETTER ABOUT IT AND AS WE HAVE NOW MORE AND MORE. PEOPLE OUT OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY COMING TO THE LEGISLATURE AND EDUCATING US AS WE DO POLICY. GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAN UP ALL STATUTES TO TAKE OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE OUT AND AND MODERNIZE WHAT WE'RE DOING SO THAT'S A CAUCUS THAT REPRESENTS A VERY IMPORTANT PART. OF OUR DISCUSSION AS WELL. SO. THIS REYES WELCOME. AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH LEGISLATIVE HEARINGS I WILL WARN YOU THAT LEGISLATORS WE'RE IN A VERY BUSY TIME WERE COMING UP WITH A HOUSE OR TO DEADLINE. THE BIG APPROPRIATIONS HEARING IS ON THURSDAY TO LEGISLATORS ARE BEING PULLED IN MANY MANY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS THIS IS BEING RECORDED. SO EVERYONE WILL HAVE ACCESS TO IT TO PLEASE DO NOT BE OFFENDED OF LEGISLATORS ARE COMING AND GOING AS THEIR SCHEDULES DICTATE AS WE ARE TRYING TO MANAGE POLICY THAT WE HAVE. ACROSS THE BOARD IT'S JUST A FEATURE OF HEARINGS THAT WE HAVE EVEN POLICY HEARINGS LEGISLATORS HAVE TO COME AGO BECAUSE OF OTHER POLICY HEARINGS THAT THEY'RE IN. SO WE'RE BEING. YANKED VARIOUS WAYS SO -- DON'T DON'T TAKE ANY OFFENSE TO THAT THAT'S JUST THE NATURE OF THE BUSINESS. ALL RIGHT I LIKE TO CALL THE FIRST PANEL. WHICH IS GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THE IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSITY IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION IN THE COURTS THIS IS AN INTRODUCTORY PANEL.

A LITTLE BIT LATER. ALL RIGHT SO [inaudible] JAVA [inaudible] WELCOME [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY. MY NAME IS GOT A BILL THAT I SENT HIM A RISING THREE L. AT UC DAVIS SCHOOL OF LAW. I GREW UP IN THE VERDANT FIELDS OF SALINAS CALIFORNIA AND YOUR MYERS ANA. I HAD TO HOMES GROWING UP. ROWS AND ROWS OF LETTUCE BROCCOLI ANDSTRAWBERRIES COVERED MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND PESTICIDES FILLED MY CHALDEAN LITTLE CLOSER TO THE MICROPHONE ONLY IF YOU'RE GETTING RECORDED THANK YOU. WHEN I WAS YOUNG EVERY YEAR AROUND NOVEMBER MY FAMILY AND I PACKED ALL OUR BELONGINGS INTO BOXES AND CRATES? TO DRIVE DOWN TO THE LETTERS HARVEST OF SOUTHERN ARIZONA. WE WERE MIGRANT FARM WORKERS. I REMEMBER IT CLEARLY AS IF IT WERE YESTERDAY. WE PACKED TWO DISHES OLD POTS AND CLOTHES AN EMPTY TNA BOXES MY FAMILY AND I ALL NEW THAT COME EARLY NOVEMBER. WE WOULD START PACKING OUR THINGS TO DRIVE DOWN TO ARIZONA AND IN MAY DRIVE BACK UP NORTH. WE DID THIS FOR FOURTEEN YEARS AND IT WAS THE BEST PART OF MY LIFE. IT CREATED A TYPE OF BOND WITH MY FAMILY THAT COULD NEVER BE BROKEN. THOUGH THERE WAS LOVE AND JOY IN THESE BEAUTIFUL FOURTEEN YEARS OF MY LIFE. I ALSO MISSED OUT ON A LOT OF EDUCATION AS A RESULT OF THE NAY UNSTABLE NATURE OF MIGRATING. THIS WAS BECAUSE WHEN WE ARRIVED WE OFTEN DIDN'T HAVE A PLACE TO STAY. MY NEAR MY WHOLE FAMILY STAYED IN MY UNCLE'S LIVING ROOM IN HIS GREEN TRAILER. THE NEXT YEAR. WE COULD BUY A TRAILER AND THE YEAR AFTER THAT. WE COULD AFFORD AN APARTMENT. I NEVER KNOW IF I WAS GOING TO HAVE A ROOM OF MY OWN OR A PLACE TO STUDY. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SELFISH DIVIDED. I NEVER KNEW HOW FAR I WAS GOING TO BE FROM SCHOOL IF I HAD TO WALK OR TAKE THE BUS. BUT I KNEW THAT MY OLDER SISTER AND MY MOM AND I WOULD GET THEIR AFTER BEING ENROLLED IN SCHOOL OVER IN ARIZONA FOR SIX OR FIVE MONTHS. IT WOULD BE TIME TO MOVE BACK TO SALINAS. MY SISTER AND I WOULD AND FORMER TEACHERS PACKER THINGS THEIR GOODBYES AND DRIVE DOWN TO HIGHWAY EIGHT BACK TO SALINAS. IT WAS A CYCLE THAT TO THIS DAY MY BODY FEELS EVERY WINTER AND EVERY SPRING. AT AROUND THE FOURTH GRADE I REALIZE THAT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO READ WELL. I HAD LOW GRADES WAS TERRIBLE AT MATH AND AS A RESULT OF MIGRATING AND THE EDUCATIONAL INCONSISTENCIES I GOT BEHIND ON MY MAJOR SUBJECTS. IT WAS THE MIGRANT PROGRAM THE BILINGUAL PROGRAM AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND MY MOM THAT GOT ME THROUGH MY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL EDUCATION. FAST FORWARD TO MY SOPHOMORE YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL. I KNOW I WANTED TO GO TO COLLEGE AND I LEARNED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH THE GIRLS INC PROGRAM. GIRLS THINK EMPOWERED MANY OF US YOUNG LATINO WOMEN IN MANY WAYS. THEY DID WORKSHOPS FIRST TO LEARN ABOUT DIFFERENT CAREERS THEY BROUGHT AN ATTORNEY WHO SPOKE TO US ABOUT PUBLIC INTEREST WORK. AND THEY TOOK US TO DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES. UC DAVIS INCLUDED. THE MENTORS OF GIRLS AND TAUGHT US ABOUT SELF CARE SELF. OF GOAL SETTING AND SELF GROWTH EVENTUALLY I GRADUATED FROM NORTH SALINAS HIGH SCHOOL IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN I WAS ACCEPTED INTO ST MARY'S COLLEGE OF CALIFORNIA. EVEN THOUGH I EXCELLED IN COLLEGE IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE I FUNDED MY WAY THROUGH IT ON MY OWN. CORRECT THREE OR TWO JOBS EVERY SEMESTER TO MAKE ENDS MEET. I WORKED AS AN ADMINISTRATIVE SAID AT ADMINISTRATIVE SECRETARY. BABYSITTER TRANSLATOR ZOOM BUT TEACHER AND POLICY CONSULTANT. THAT'S HOW I COULD AFFORD TO PAY RENT. IN BETWEEN JOBS I WENT TO CLASS AND THE WRITING CENTER. I NEVER KNEW A PRIVATE TUTOR BUT I USE THE RESOURCES ON CAMPUS AS BEST AS I COULD. I CONSTANTLY APPLIED FOR SCHOLARSHIPS SO THAT MY PARENTS WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. ME AND COULD SUPPORT MY TWO YOUNGER SISTERS. BUT THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT IMPORTANT PERSON IN MY ST MARY'S COLLEGE CAREER. IT WAS MY PROFESSOR MYRNA SANTIAGO WHO WAS THE THE DIRECTOR OF THE HISTORY PROGRAM SHE WAS MY MENTOR TOOK ME UNDER MY TOOK ME UNDER HER WING. AND TAUGHT ME HOW TO WRITE WELL. THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF GOING TO COLLEGE WAS PROBABLY TRANSITIONING TO AND FROM BECAUSE I WAS AND I WAS THE FIRST IN MY FAMILY TO ATTEND COLLEGE AND GRADUATE FROM IT. NO ONE IN MY FAMILY HAD GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL IN THE UNITED STATES SO THERE WAS NO ONE I COULD REACH OUT. TO BUT THERE WAS. BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS MY PARENTS WERE WILLING TO SUPPORT ME. AND THEN I A ALSO REACHED OUT TO PROFESSOR MANA SANTIAGO TO TALK ABOUT TAKING THE L. SAT. SHE RECOMMENDED A PROGRAM. THAT WAS CALLED THE KING CALL OUT REACH PROGRAM AT UC DAVIS SCHOOL OF LAW [inaudible] THIS PROGRAM. WAS A PERFECT PROGRAM FOR ME BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO LEARN ABOUT THE REQUIREMENTS TAKING THEY ALL SAT. AND HOW TO GET INTO LAW SCHOOL. I KNEW THAT I WANTED TO GO INTO LAW SCHOOL BECAUSE I HAD SEEN A LOT OF THE INEQUALITIES THAT MY PARENTS FACED WHILE THEY WERE FARMWORKERS. I I KNEW THAT. THEY WERE WORKING LOW INCOME JOBS WITH NO BENEFITS AND I WANTED TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR THEM AND FOR OTHER FARMWORKERS. TODAY I AM AMONG THE MINORITY OF LATINOS WHO MADE IT INTO LAW SCHOOL. SO FAR MY LEGAL CAREER I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE WORKERS RIGHTS CLINIC THE IMMIGRATION CLINIC AND CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. IN THOSE POSITIONS I HAVE PROVIDED LEGAL COUNSEL TO MONOLINGUAL SPANISH SPEAKERS OR FOLKS WERE LOW INCOME. I'VE PROVIDED LEGAL SERVICES TO RURAL COMMUNITIES AND WOODLAND. LOW INCOME AN INDIGENT FOLKS IN SACRAMENTO AND WILL ONE DAY RETURN TO THE SALINAS VALLEY. TO DO THE SAME WORK. I'VE BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE MADE THE RIGHT DECISIONS AND ENDED UP WHERE I AM TODAY BUT NOT EVERYONE RECEIVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AS ME. URGE YOU TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING PROGRAMS THAT INCREASE DIVERSITY IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO WANT TO GIVE BACK TO OUR COMMUNITIES. PROGRAMS LIKE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS WRITING WORKSHOPS READING PROGRAMS AND THE ARTS HELP STUDENTS EXPRESS THEMSELVES AND FIND PASSIONS LIKE THEY DID FOR ME. I ALSO URGE YOU TO SUPPORT MORE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS THE THAT WILL EMPOWER FAMILIES TO DEAL WITH THE STRESS AN INTERGENERATIONAL TRAUMA. SO THAT STUDENTS CAN THRIVE IN THEIR CAREERS AND FAMILIES CAN HEAL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I THINK WHAT WE'LL DO IS GO TO THE PANEL AND THEN OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER HARRIS GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR OPENING THE DOOR FOR THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY TO BE IN THIS FROM TODAY. MY NAME IS ERIC HARRIS I'M A LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. DRC IS THE CALIFORNIA PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY AGENCY FOR THE STATE AND THE LARGEST DISABILITY ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION IN THE NATION. WE ASSIST THOUSANDS ANNUAL ANNUALLY AND A MYRIAD OF DISABILITY RELATED ISSUES INCLUDING EDUCATION. DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES MENTAL HEALTH HEALTH CARE CIVIL RIGHTS HOUSING IMMIGRATION. AND ACCESSIBILITY THROUGH MULTIPLE AVENUES SUCH AS IT INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTATION LITIGATION AND LEGISLATION. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES ARE REPRESENTED IN LAW SCHOOLS IN THE BAR AND ON THE BENCH. BECAUSE OUR EXPERIENCE AND POINT OF VIEW MATTER. ACCORDING TO THE US CENSUS BUREAU ABOUT 19% OF THE POPULATION HAD A DISABILITY IN TWO THOUSAND TEN IN THE UNITED STATES. THERE ARE THREE MAIN ISSUES INVOLVING DISABILITYDIVERSITY IN THE LAW. FIRST WE HAVE A PIPELINE PROBLEM. WHERE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES ARE LESS LIKELY TO APPLY AND BE ADMITTED TO LAW SCHOOL? ONLY TWELVE POINT 3% OF WORKING AGE PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES HELD A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR HIGHER. COMPARED TO THIRTY POINT 6% OF NON DISABLED PERSONS. SECOND THERE IS ALSO A STRONG DISABILITY POVERTY CORRELATION. MANY INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES ARE NOT ABLE TO FINANCE LAW SCHOOL AT ALL. THIRD THE NUMBER OF LAWYERS WITH DISABILITIES IT'S HARD TO DETERMINE. UNLIKE RACE GENDER ETHNICITY AND MORE RECENTLY SEXUAL ORIENTATION THERE IS LITTLE REPORTING ON DISABILITY STATISTICS. PAST ABA PRESIDENT WILLIAM NEUKOM STATED IN HIS PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE THAT ALTHOUGH IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE EXACT DEGREE. THAT THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY IS UNDER REPRESENTED IN THE LEGAL COMMUNITY IT IS EVIDENT THAT LAWYERS WITH DISABILITIES. TO HAVE GREATER DIFFICULTY GETTING A JOB AFTER LAW SCHOOL. AND HAVE HIGHER RATES OF UNEMPLOYMENT THE LAWYERS WHO DO NOT HAVE DISABILITIES. MANY LAWYERS WITH DISABILITIES STILL END UP WHERE THEY ALWAYS HAVE. CHANNEL TOWARD GOVERNMENT WORK ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS OR SOLO IN SMALL FIRM EMPLOYMENT. OFTEN WITH DISABILITY RELATED PRACTICES. OLD ATTITUDES AND PERCEPTIONS OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES HAVE BEEN SLOW TO CHANGE. ADDITIONALLY. DEAR SEE ADVOCATES FOR INCREASING THE NUMBER OF JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. SO THAT THE BENCH CAN BE BETTER REFLECTIVE OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. WELL THERE HAS BEEN IMPROVEMENT AND ETHNIC AND OTHER DIVERSITY GROUPS THAT IS NOT TRUE OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. THERE ARE THIRTEEN TOTAL JUDGES OR 2% OF CALIFORNIAN JUDGES WHO HAVE IDENTIFIED WITH HAVING A DISABILITY. LAWYERS AND JUDGES ARE CHANGE AGENTS FOR ENTIRE COMMUNITIES. PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES BRING A PERSPECTIVE AN OUTLOOK THAT IS UNIQUE AND IMPORTANT. THEY CAN ALSO ENHANCE THE ENVIRONMENT. THROUGH OTHERS AND HELP WORK THROUGH THE PIPELINE OF LAW SCHOOL THE BAR EXAM. THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND THE JUDICIARY. MY EXPERIENCE I AM RARE. MY LAW SCHOOL HAD APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS. I WAS THE ONLY INDIVIDUAL WHO USED TO WILSHIRE AT THAT LAW SCHOOL. LAW SCHOOL AS WE ALL KNOW IS CHALLENGING ON ITS OWN. READING AND ANALYZING CASES DOESN'T EXACTLY COME NATURALLY. I ALSO HAD TO DEAL WITH THE ADDED STRESS OR BURDEN OF BEING THE DISABLED REPRESENTATIVE OR PERSON WITH EIGHTY A PERSPECTIVE. I DID NOT HAVE COLLEAGUES THAT I COULD SHARE THAT EXPERIENCE WITH. IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO NAVIGATE THROUGH LAW SCHOOL WITHOUT OTHER STUDENTS AND FACULTY WHO HAD SIMILAR EXPERIENCES AS ME. ADDING TO MY OBSTACLE COURSE THAT IS DISABILITY I AM AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE. THE INTERSECTION ALLEY OF DISABILITY AND RACE CAN ADD EVEN MORE CHALLENGES. THE SPACE WAS DIFFICULT TO UNDERGO WHILE I WAS IN LAW SCHOOL. I MOSTLY HAD TO STAY CONNECTED WITH MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS. IT WAS A REAL CHALLENGE. TO MAKE MYSELF FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WHILE IN LAW SCHOOL. AS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE WITH A DISABILITY I HAVE LEARNED HOW TO MAKE DISCOMFORT ACTUALLY COMFORTABLE FOR ME. HOWEVER WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW THE NEXT SET OF LAW STUDENTS OF COLOR WITH DISABILITIES TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SAME THING THAT I WENT THROUGH. CALIFORNIA SHOULD TREAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AS IF WE ARE IMPORTANT. WE HOPE THE STATE. WILL BE AS WELCOMING AND UNDERSTANDING OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AS IT CAN AND CONSIDER THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX. AT THE R. C. WE SEEK TO ADDRESS ONGOING BY SEIZE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. BOTH VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE. WITH THE SPECIFIC GOAL OF BROADER INCLUSION IN COMMUNITIES BOTH PROFESSIONALLY AND PERSONALLY. THE LEGAL PROFESSION HAS A LONG WAY TO GO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU. THIS IS A BURKE THANK YOU I KNOW YOUR FLIGHT WAS DELAYED IT WAS SO WHICH IS TOP GETTING UP HERE. TO START MY DADDY'S YES EXCUSE YOU ARE THANK YOU GOOD MORNING -- MY NAME IS RICK SERVER -- AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A QUALITY CALIFORNIA THE NATION'S LARGEST STATEWIDE LGBT CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION -- I'M ALSO A LAWYER AND PRIOR TO BECOMING A QUALITY CALIFORNIA'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR I PRACTICE LAW FROM WAS TWENTY NINE YEARS AT LAKE MEN WALK INS. LLP NOW THAN LATE NATION'S LARGEST US BASED LAW FIRM -- WHEN I BEGAN MY PRACTICE AT LATE THEM IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE THERE WERE VERY FEW OUT LGBT Q. LAWYERS AT MAJOR FIRMS ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY? AND THEY WERE NOT AT LAKE THEM. WHEN I CAME OUT THE FIRM IN NINETEEN NINETY AS A FIFTY YEAR ASSOCIATES I BECAME THE FIRST OUT LAWYER IN THE FIRM AND WHEN I WAS ELECTED TO THE PARTNERSHIP IN? NINETEEN NINETY TWO THE FIRM'S FIRST OPENLY GAY OPENLY LGBT Q. PARTNER. I REMEMBER THAT WHEN I CAME OUT IT WAS SORT OF A BIG DEAL AND ALTHOUGH THERE WERE. OTHER LGBT KILLERS IN THE FIRM WHO WERE NOT OUT OF PARTNERS AND ASSOCIATES. NONE WERE OUT BECAUSE OF THIS SIGNIFICANT SOCIAL STIGMA THAT WAS SO PRESENT AT THAT TIME AND THE RISK OF BEING OUT HARMING THEIR CAREER -- TO LIKE THEM IS CREDITED REMEMBER MY DEPARTMENT HAD CALLING ME INTO HER OFFICE THE DAY AFTER -- IT BECAME CLEAR I WAS OUT BECAUSE I DID A FUNDRAISER FOR BARBARA BOXER AND WAS IN THE PAPER. AND THAT'S HOW I SORT OF CAME OUT -- AND SHE BASICALLY COMIC OFFICE AND SAID THAT YOU KNOW SHE WAS PROUD OF ME AND THAT IT WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON MY CAREER AND LUCKILY IT DIDN'T -- BUT AS THE OTHER LGBT ASSOCIATES AT THE FIRM. YOU KNOW WAITED OVER THOSE COUPLE YEARS -- NOT COMING OUT AND WANTED TO SORT OF TO LOOK AT WHAT THE FIRM I DO -- WITH MY NEW REVELATION -- THEY BECAME COMMAND AFTER ACCOUNT FOR PARTNER AND YOU KNOW -- TO ITS CREDIT -- I AND OTHERS WORKED WITH LATE THEM AND NOW DO THEY LIKE IT HAS HUNDREDS OF LGBT Q. LAWYERS. A ROBUST AFFINITY GROUP AND THE FIRM IS OUR LOW LOW QUALITY CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST PROVIDE A PARTNER HAVING CONTRIBUTED TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN LEGAL SERVICES IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. ON ONE OF THE TRENCH INTO MILITARY CASES WHERE THE REPRESENTING US -- I SALE OF THAT IT'S THE PREDICATE TO JUST -- EMPHASIZE HOW IMPORTANT -- REPRESENTATION IN THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY AS BOTH FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF PROVIDING ROLE MODELS AND ALSO FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HELPING TO EDUCATE. HEARTS AND MINDS WITHIN THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND WITHIN THE WORK PLACES IN WHICH WE ALL WORK. OUR MISSION AT A QUALITY CALIFORNIA. IS TO BRING THE VOICES OF LGBTQ PEOPLE AND OUR ALLIES THE INSTITUTIONS OF POWER. TO CREATE A WORLD THAT'S HEALTHY JUSTIN FULLY EQUAL FOR ALL LGBT Q. PEOPLE. A KEY OBJECTIVE OF OUR LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS IS TO ADDRESS THE SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES IN HEALTH AND WELL BEING. THE LGBT Q. PEOPLE EXPERIENCE COMPETE TO THE REST OF THE PUBLIC AND LGBT PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL COMPARED TO THE REST THE PUBLIC MORE LIKELY TO BE LIVING AND POVERTY MORE LIKELY TO BE. ARRESTED MORE LIKELY BE CONVICTED ON A REST AND IF THAT AND LGBT Q. PERSON IS ALSO A MEMBER OF A COMMITTEE OF COLOR AND IMMIGRANT A PERSON LIVING WITH HIV. THERE THEY FARE EVEN WORSE ON ALL OF THOSE STATISTICS -- SO IN ADDITION TO PASSING LAWS ACHIEVING FULL OF THE QUALITY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE FOR OUR COMMUNITY REQUIRES THAT WE FOCUS ON THE INSTITUTIONS OF POWER AND THAT'S WHY. IT'S IN OUR MISSION AND AND THE INSTITUTIONS THAT SERVE THE BROADER PUBLIC OFTEN OF WHICH LACK THE CULTURAL COMPETENCY TO SERVE LGBT Q. PEOPLE. AND WHICH SOMETIMES ARE OUTRIGHT HOSTILE TO OUR COMMUNITY THE LEGAL PROFESSION THE JUDICIARY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ARE AMONG THE KEY INSTITUTIONS THAT WERE FOCUSED ON THAT'S WHY QUALITY CALIFORNIA SPONSORED A. B. EIGHTY SEVEN AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE -- TO HAVE A DISCRIMINATION AGAINST LGBT Q. PEOPLE IN JURY CALIFORNIA JURIES AB TWENTY FIVE OH FOUR AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY. MEMBER EVAN LOW WHICH REQUIRED LGBT Q. CULTURAL KANSI TRAINING FOR CALIFORNIA OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND EIGHTY NINE FIFTY THREE AUTHORED. BY THEN -- DOUBTS SENATOR SHIRLEY WEBER WHICH ADDRESS RACIAL IDENTITY AND LGBT Q. POLICE PROFILING. OUR LEADERSHIP PROGRAMS ARE SIMILARLY AIMED AT PREPARING LGBT Q. PEOPLE FOR GOVERNMENT SERVICE THE WILLIAMS INSTITUTE STUDY SHOWED THAT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT THE RAW ELEVEN OUT OF TWO THOUSAND OR SO -- APPOINTED PEOPLE ENDS CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT. INDEED IT DOES YOU ARE SIMPLY UNDER REPRESENTED THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND WITHIN THE JUDICIARY IT'S REALLY HARD TO ESTIMATE THAN THAT WHAT THAT UNDER REPRESENTATION IS BECAUSE NO ONE CANCERS. WERE NOT COUNTED IN THE CENSUS PRESIDENT TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DECIDED NOT TO INCLUDE ACCOUNTABILITY TO KEEP PEOPLE THE TWENTY TEN A CENSUS -- BUT THE WILLIAMS INSTITUTE IS ESTIMATED THAT ARE -- THAT WE ARE 45% OF THE POPULATION WE BELIEVE THAT THAT'S ABOUT DOUBLE -- BASED UPON THE SOCIAL STIGMA AND AND UNDER REPORTING BY MEMBERS OUR COMMUNITY AND INDEED A POLL THAT WE COMMISSIONED -- QUALITY CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN A REPORTED THAT 12% OF CALIFORNIA REGISTERED VOTERS DONE BY TOLCHIN RESEARCH IDENTIFIES MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY SO. THE YARDSTICKS ARE SOMEPLACE BETWEEN FIVE AND PROBABLY 10% AS REALLY THE YARDSTICKS GIVEN THOSE WE KNOW THAT LGBT PEOPLE ARE STILL SIGNIFICANTLY UNDER REPRESENTED THE LEGAL PROFESSION BASED ON THE VERY LIMITED INFORMATION -- THAT WE HAVE ALTHOUGH THE CALIFORNIA STATE BAR BEGAN -- TO COLLECT ONLY IN NINETEEN TWENTY NINETEEN THIS YEAR. WHAT WE CALL SAID YOU DATA SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY DATA? AS PART OF A VOLUNTARY SURVEY THE MOST RECENT FACT SHEET PRODUCED BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE BAR ON ADVANCING DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION. CONCLUDES THAT CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS ARE LESS DIVERSE THAN THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND WHILE THE FACT SHEET APPROPRIATE INCLUDES INFORMATION ON GENDER AND RACE IT SHOCKINGLY PROVIDES NO INFORMATION. ABOUT DISABILITY OR YOU ARE SO G. DATA -- THERE ARE SEVERAL NATIONAL SOURCES THAT HAVE REPORTING INFORMATION ABOUT THE LGBT COMMUNITY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF LEGAL PLACEMENT. TRACKS THE PERCENTAGE OF LGBT Q. LAWYERS IN LARGE LEGAL EMPLOYERS -- AND BASICALLY IN TWENTY TWENTY EIGHTEEN NOW REPORTED THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF LGBT Q. LAWYERS IN THOSE FIRMS WAS APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT 86%. UP FROM 1% WHEN THEY STARTED TRACKING THAT DATA IN. TWO THOUSAND TWO IN TERMS OF JUDGES. THE DATA -- IS SIMILARLY LOW -- BASED ON DATA FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL CALIFORNIA ONLY SIXTY TWO OUT OF SEVENTEEN HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE JUDGES ON THE CALIFORNIA BENCH IDENTIFY. AS LGBT Q. AND THERE'S ONLY ONE TRANS GENDER JUDGE ALAMEDA SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE VICTORIA CALICO SKI. AND THAT'S AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE REALLY THE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS MADE BY GOVERNOR BROWN WHO POINTED SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR OF THOSE JUDGES. AND OF WITH A 6% OF WHICH WERE LGBT Q.. SO I GUESS AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING ALL OF THIS UP I HAVE. YOU KNOW WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT IT'S IMPORTANT WE PRIDE ROLE MODELS THE JUDICIARY IS AN IMPORTANT INSTITUTION -- THAT -- GOES TO SORT OF WHETHER NOT WE REALLY ACHIEVE JUSTICE IN OUR COURT SYSTEMS AND I HAVE TO CLOSING THOUGHTS THAT I'D ASK YOU TO FOCUS ON FOR LGBT Q. PEOPLE VOLUNTARY DATA COLLECTION IS IMPORTANT TO MEASURE NOT ONLY HOW FAR WE NEED TO GO. TO CHI BETTER INCLUSION BUT ALSO TO ELEVATE WHETHER OUR CRIMINAL AND CIVIL COURT SYSTEMS ARE CHEATING MEASURES OF JUSTICE. WE NEED THE BARD EVALUATE THE DATA THAT THEY'VE ALREADY STARTED TO COLLECT AND WE NEED STUDY DATA ON ALL GOVERNMENT ROGRAMS THAT THAT BASICALLY TOUCH BASE TOUCH WITH THE LEGAL PROFESSION AS WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOOSE THE SECOND AND I'LL CLOSE WITH THIS -- BUT THAT'S WE SPONSORED ALL THESE DATA COLLECTION BILLS -- TAPPING THE COURTS AND LEGAL PROFESSIONAL BE COMPLICATED BUT IT'S IMPORTANT WE FIGURE THAT OUT SOON SECOND CONDUCTING LGT CULTURAL COME TO TRAINING FOR ALL JUDGES LAWYERS COURT STAFF IS A HIGH PRIORITY. WHEN LGBT PEOPLE INTERACTED THE LEGAL PROFESSION IN OUR COURTS IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND AND THEY WERE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT AND TRAINING WILL DOT AND THAT? DISCRIMINATION OR LACK OF ACCEPTANCE UNDERSTANDING BUT IT WILL BE HALF WILL HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON INCLUSION IN THE PROFESSION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GREAT THANK YOU. JUDGE MISSUS.

TO AND WHERE I HAD TO ASK IN FIFTH GRADE. TO BE PLACED IN A BETTER ENGLISH READING CLASS THE ULTIMATELY WAS WHAT OPEN THE DOORS AND GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT I HAVE TO THIS DAY. IT WAS. A TEN YEAR OLD KID ASKING FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT WHEN I WAS ULTIMATELY PLACED IN GAVE CLASSES GIFTED AND TALENTED EDUCATION.

BUT IT WAS MY MOTHER WITH A SIXTH GRADE EDUCATION THAT MARCHED INTO THE SCHOOL AS THAT IF SHE CAN DO THE WORK THAT SHE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO REMAIN.

YOU SEE I WENT TO CAL STATE FULLERTON I WENT TO CALIFORNIA WESTERN AND WITH AN IVY LEAGUE. I HEARD THINGS LIKE LEGACY IN PEDIGREE. AND SO I SAID YOU KNOW I'M GONNA APPLY ANYWAY. AND I APPLIED FEBRUARY OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND I'M VERY PROUD TO SAY THAT WHEN I SUBMITTED MY APPLICATION AND I TOLD MY STORY. TO THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR BROWN. THAT HE HEARD IT. AND SO BY DECEMBER TWENTY TWELVE I WAS APPOINTED AN ORANGE COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE. I CAN TELL YOU THAT I'M ONE OF FOR LATINOS THAT CURRENTLY SIT ON THE BENCH OF THE ORANGE COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT I WAS A SUPERVISOR TWO YEARS INTO BEING EIGHT OR COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE. AND THAT SIX YEARS INTO MY PRACTICE I'M ON THE FELONY TRIAL PANEL WHICH GENERALLY DOESN'T HAPPEN. AND THE REASON WHY I SAY ALL OF THIS AND I KNOW THAT MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME HUMILITY. BUT IT'S BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO TELL OUR STORY BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST MINE IT'S MISTER DRAW THOSE AS WELL ONE DAY I HOPE THAT SHE WILL JOIN ME ON THE BENCH. AND SO I CLOSE WITH THIS. AS THE JUDGE FIRST AND FOREMOST I APPLY THE LAW. I CONSIDER MYSELF A WISE LATINA. I HOPE THAT THE RICHNESS OF MY EXPERIENCE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT HELP ME REACH A BETTER CONCLUSION [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT I'M GONNA OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS AND FIRST OF ALL THIS BUT THE RATHER. AND REALIZE YOU WITH GIRLS THINK THE LAST TIME. I INTERACTED WITH THEM WAS EARLIER THIS WINTER AND THEY CAME UP INTO THIS HEARING ROOM. AND I GOT A CHANCE TO TALK TO THEM AND I THINK APROPOS. THE THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE THAT YOU FACE AND ESPECIALLY. THAT THE TWO OF YOU ARE NOT CHALLENGES THAT I FACED BEING WHITE BEING MALE. THAT THAT'S KIND OF THE CLASSIC PRIVILEGE AND I THINK THAT'S WHY IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALL NEED TO BE VERY COGNIZANT OF BUT I ASKED THE GIRLS TO COME UP AND SIT UP HERE. AS OPPOSED TO OUT THERE. BECAUSE IF YOU CAN'T ENVISION YOURSELF IN A ROLE. THEN YOU CLOSE THOSE DOORS ESPECIALLY WITH OTHERS TELLING YOU YOU'RE NOT QUALIFIED OR YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO GET THERE. SO I THINK THAT'S FOR ALL OF US TO REMEMBER AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GIVING KIDS IN STUDENTS. THAT OPPORTUNITY TO ENVISION THEMSELVES. WHERE THEY DREAM OR OR WHAT'S POSSIBLE OTHERWISE THEY DON'T? GO UP THERE SO BUT UP ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT CAME UP AND MISTER HARRIS MRS VERY THE YOU BOTH BROUGHT UP WITH DATA. AND DATA COLLECTION AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOT COLLECTING A LOT OF DATA AND OTHERS THAT WORK THAT'S BEING DONE AROUND IT. BUT YOU ALSO AN INTEGRATED. IF WE'RE GONNA COLLECT DATA THERE IS STIGMA IN GLBT AND IN THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY. HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT? AS WE COLLECT DATA AS WE REALLY THAT THAT WE'RE ABLE TO GET. TO THE TRUTH OF WHO PEOPLE ARE AND AND GET THAT WILLING. TO RISE ABOVE THAT STIGMA AND AND BE COUNTED CORRECTLY SO THAT WE CAN TRACK AND UNDERSTAND AND THEN KNOW THAT HELPS US UNDERSTAND WHERE OUR PROBLEMS ARE. SO IF IF BOTH YOU CAN HELP WITH THAT QUESTION [inaudible] MR -- THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION -- THAT QUESTION ACTUALLY GETS BROUGHT UP A LOT AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT -- THINGS TO REMEMBER IS THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES -- JUST LIKE THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY DO NOT HAVE TO DISCLOSE -- THAT IS A PERSONAL DECISION -- AND THAT IS ONE THAT IS OFTEN VERY VERY CHALLENGING ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY -- PSYCHOLOGICAL DISABILITY MENTAL -- HEALTH -- DISORDER OF HOWEVER IN MY OPINION OF THE LEGAL COMMUNITY CAN DO ITS BEST TO BE AS WELCOMING AS POSSIBLE -- HAVE THE TYPE OF ATTITUDE AND WELCOMING ENVIRONMENT -- THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WOULD WANT -- TO APPROACH WOULD -- EMBRACE. AND WOULD FEEL EMBRACED -- I BELIEVE THAT HAVING OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION OR AROUND THE LEGAL PROFESSION ON THE JUDICIARY -- WHO ARE COMFORTABLE AND AT PEACE WITH WHO THEY ARE OF AND ABLE TO TELL THEIR STORIES -- IT WILL. INVITE A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES -- TO BE MORE OPEN -- ABOUT WHO THEY ARE -- AND KNOW THAT THEIR TRUTH AND THEIR EXPERIENCES ARE IMPORTANT AND WILL BE TAKING OF INTO ACCOUNT WHEN THEY GO TO LAW SCHOOL OR INTO THE LEGAL PROFESSION THANK YOU. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I MEAN THE FIRST STEP IS TO ACTUALLY ASK VOLUNTARY QUESTIONS ON ALL FORMS IT'S NOT HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA I THINK WE HAVE THREE AREAS WHERE. IT'S HAPPENING WHICH IS THEN THE HEALTH AREA EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATION NOW -- BUT REALLY IT'S YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH NOW BECAUSE BEEN. ASKING ABOUT -- SEGMENTATION GENDER DAILY SINCE TWO THOUSAND TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE BAR DID NOT START ASKING ABOUT THAT UNTIL THIS YEAR'S SO -- YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THAT QUESTION BE ASKED I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE. YOU KNOW HAVE THIS SENSE THAT IS SOME HOUSE SHAMEFUL TO ASK SOMEONE ABOUT THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR GENDER IDENTITY AND WE CAN'T. WE HAVE TO GET PAST THE STIGMA OF THAT BEING A BAD THING -- AND SO OBVIOUSLY YOU DON'T WANT TO FORCE ANYONE TO EVER ASKED IT'S GOT ALWAYS BE A VOLUNTARY QUESTION BUT I THINK EVEN JUST ASKING THE QUESTION IS THE FIRST STEP. IF THERE ARE WAYS AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY IN A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM IT'S HARDER TO SORT OF FIGURE THIS OUT BUT WE DO KNOW WHEN -- WHEN RESPONSES ARE ANONYMOUS ARE SOMEWHAT ANONYMOUS THAT THE RESPONSE RATES GO UP -- WE WERE SHOCKED FRANKLY WHEN WE DID OUR POLL IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND IT WAS A STATISTICALLY VALID POLL OF REGISTERED VOTERS ARE SUBTLE PUBLIC BUT IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S A PRETTY GOOD SAMPLE OF A LOT OF PEOPLE. TO FIND OUT THAT 12% OF THE CALIFORNIA RICHARD VOTERS IDENTIFIED AS MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. THAT WAS SHOCKING TO US MOST ESTIMATES. YOU KNOW THAT ARE OUT THERE ON CITIES BEFORE HAD ESTIMATED BETWEEN FOUR AND 5% OF PEOPLE SELF REPORT. A WE HAD ALWAYS ASSUMED THAT THAT WAS ABOUT DOUBLE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT STIGMA PARTICULARLY IN RURAL COMMUNITIES AND PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING FROM CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS BACKGROUNDS. OFTEN WILL NOT EVEN THINK OF THEMSELVES AS A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY EVEN THOUGH MAYBE THEY MAY BE ENGAGING AND SAME SEX ACTIVITIES TO SOME EXTENT. SO -- I THINK FOR YOU KNOW FINDING. WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN ASK THE QUESTION COMFORTABLY IT'S YOU KNOW ON A FORM WHERE PEOPLE CAN. RESPOND WHEN THEY'RE SITTING BY THEMSELVES I MEAN THERE'S A LOT THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS WE DO CULTURE COME TO TRAINING AND HEALTH CARE SETTINGS AND THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY ARE TRAINING EVERYONE TO DO ALWAYS ASK THE FORM PUT IT ON THE BOTTOM. PICTURE IT'S VOLUNTARY AND WE KNOW THAT WHEN THAT HAPPENS PEOPLE FILL THE FORM OUT BUT FIRST QUESTION IS ASKING THE QUESTIONS. POINT TAKEN THAT JUST ASK THE QUESTIONS AND THEN. SEE IF THERE'S A WAY TO DIG A LITTLE BIT DEEPER IF IF NECESSARY. GOOD AND WE HAVE A CAPTIVE AUDIENCE BOTH WITH THE BAR. AND THE BENCH SO WE WE DO KNOW HOW TO REACH EVERYBODY AND AND ASK THOSE QUESTIONS [inaudible] THE THREATS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK THE PANEL SO MUCH ROOM FOR THE DIVERSITY THAT IS HERE -- AT THE AT THE WITNESS TABLE THANK YOU SO MUCH. I YOUR MESSAGE IS IS HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR -- JUDGMENT CS I I'VE HEARD YOU SPEAK BEFORE IT AND I I REALLY ADMIRE WHERE YOU CAME FROM -- BECAUSE YOU GIVE HOPE. TO OF GOT IN -- AS SHE'S -- AS AS SHE'S LOOKING AT HER FUTURE SHE NO SHE'S GOING TO BE ON THE BENCH OR SHE'S GOING TO BE PRESIDENT -- THE EVERYTHING IS AVAILABLE TO HER. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE DISABILITY. AND THEN YOU'RE ALSO AN AFRICAN AMERICAN BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT THE INTERSECTION NOW TO SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO BE SO CONCERNED WITH -- AND IT. THOSE STORES HAVE TO BE OPENED. AND RICK WHAT CAN I SAY I BUT IN ATTORNEY FOR SO MANY YEARS I LOVE HAVING COLLEAGUES SITTING HERE WITH US RIGHT -- KNOWING THAT THAT THAT WE'RE RIGHT WELL REPRESENTED -- IT I BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS DIVERSITY AND JUST AS YOU SAID I THANK THINK THAT EVERYBODY IT'S ALWAYS TRYING TO DEFINE US -- HE'S A DISABLED MAN -- HUGHES AND LGBT -- WARRIOR -- SHE'S JUST A STUDENT AT THE FARM WORKER. BUT THEY CAN'T DEFINE US AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE ARE WE WE GET TO SHOW BECAUSE WHEN WE HAVE THAT DIVERSITY WHETHER IT'S ON THE BENCH OR WE HAVE IT WITH -- WITH WITH OUR IN OUR LEGAL PROFESSION OR ANYWHERE -- THAT'S WE HAVE GREATNESS IS WHEN WE DO HAVE DIVERSITY SO IT'S IT'S ALL OF YOU THAT HELPS TO MAKE OUR PROFESSION GREAT. AND TO THE BENCH GREAT SO I I THANK YOU SO MUCH OF FOR FOR BEING HERE FOR TESTIFYING YOUR WORD IS REALLY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. TO THANK YOU LET ME FIRST THANK THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR FOR HOLDING THIS. IS HEARING AND I DID HAVE A CHANCE. TO MAKE A FEW OPENING COMMENTS I'D LIKE TO DO IT BUT WITH -- SOME REFLECTION ON THE COMMENTS HE JUST MADE A PERSONAL JUDGE MISIA'S THANK YOU. FOR HOW YOU SHARE YOUR STORY -- I THINK FOR MANY OF US WHO ARE -- ATTORNEYS OF COLOUR HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WE WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE EITHER -- AS SOME OF IMMIGRANTS -- I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BECOME A LAWYER. MY TEACHERS AND SEEN AS A LAWYER MY FAMILY CERTAINLY DIDN'T THINK THAT ANY OF US. WOULD BE IN THE PROFESSIONS THAT WE'RE IN NOW AND AND YET WE ARE HERE -- AND I THINK FOR MANY OF US. IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WHILE WE WERE THE LUCKY FEW. THAT WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR LEGAL PROFESSION LOOKS AS DIVERSE AS CALIFORNIA IS -- APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS ABOUT DATA SOMETHING I'VE HAD A THE HONOR TO WORK WITH THAT MR SUPPORT EQUALITY CALIFORNIA ON BUT AS A STATE BARS OWN DATA SHOWS AND I THINK THE NEXT PANEL IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT. THE DATA IS REALLY STARK ABOUT HOW MUCH WORK WE HAVE TO DO. THE FACT IS -- THE LEGAL PROFESSION IS ALMOST 80% WHITE WHILE THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC IS ONLY 30% 37% WHITE -- THE FACT IS THE LEGAL PROFESSION IS ALMOST 60% MALE. WHICH MEANS ALMOST 50% MORE MEN IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION THAN WOMAN -- AND YOU CAN LOOK AT EVERY INDICATOR OF HOW WE'RE DOING WITH REGARD TO DIVERSITY WERE NOT DOING WELL I KNOW WE'RE GONNA HEAR LATER. ABOUT SOME STUDIES SPECIFICALLY IN THE API COMMUNITY -- BUT DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITY SOME NUMBERS AND FOR EXAMPLE MAJOR LAW FIRMS. API'S HAVE THE HIGHEST ATTRITION RATES THE LOWEST RATE OF PARTNERSHIPS TO ASSOCIATES -- VAST MAJORITY IF API ATTORNEYS REPORT EXPERIENCING VERY LITTLE ACCESS TO MENTORSHIP. IMPLICIT BIAS. AS WELL AS LOW REPRESENTATION IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN GOVERNMENT SECTOR AND AND THIS IS. NOT JUST THE STORY THE API COMMUNITY IT'S IS THE STORY OF OF ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES -- I WANT TO JUST OBSERVE ONE THING WHICH IS A FEW YEARS AGO WE HAD A PRETTY ROBUST CONVERSATION FOR SEVERAL YEARS AROUND STATE BAR REFORM. IN I DON'T THINK IT WAS AN ACCIDENT -- THAT ALONG WITH THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT REFORM WAS BEING DRIVEN BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE THREE ETHNIC CAUCUSES. AND I THINK FOR MANY OF US WE HAVE SEEN THE MAJOR INSTITUTIONS IN THE STATE -- NOT FOCUSED ON THESE ISSUES -- AND AFFECT ALSO TO OBSERVE THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE MOST ROBUST LEADERSHIP AND WHEN IT COMES. TO TWO ATTORNEYS REPRESENTING DIVERSITY -- ARE IN BARSA STATIONS ARE OUTSIDE OF THE STATE BAR AND ETHNIC BAR ASSOCIATION AND WOMAN BAR ASSOCIATION TEN LGBT BAR SISSY ACTIONS. IN PART BECAUSE THE MAIN LEGAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE NOT FOCUSED ON THIS -- THE MAIN. INSTITUTIONS IN OUR STATE WHEN IT COMES TO THE STATE BAR THE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAVE HISTORICALLY NOT BEEN VIEWED. BY COMMUNITIES OF DIVERSITY AS INSTITUTIONS THAT SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON THESE ISSUES. I WILL SAY IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS IN THE LAST YEAR I HAVE NOTED. I THINK A CHANGE IN TONE FROM THE STATE BAR IN THE DISH JUDICIAL COUNCIL ABOUT THE WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE ON THESE QUESTIONS AND ISSUES I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE FROM THEM LATER. BUT FOR I THINK MANY OF US THE JURY IS GOING TO BE OUT. UNTIL THE DATA CHANGES I THINK IT'S EASY TO TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES IT'S EASY TO SAY WE ARE COMMITTED TO THESE ISSUES BUT IT'S MUCH HARDER TO ACTUALLY MOVE THE CHANGE FORD SO -- LET ME JUST END MY COMMENTS WITH THE QUESTION IF THERE WERE ONE OR TWO MAJOR INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES THAT YOU COULD MAKE -- WHAT WOULD THEY BE WHAT WOULD THEY BE? I'M AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION AND AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. I WILL SAY THAT -- THE INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES THAT. THAT OUR OUR HOPE -- TO BY OUR LET THE NEXT COMMUNITY PARTICULAR THE CALIFORNIA AT THE NO JUDGES ASSOCIATION OPPORTUNITY. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE REASONS WHY TALK ABOUT BEING A GARDENER'S DAUGHTER IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IT'S IT'S HARD WORK IT'S SUPPORT BUT IT'S OPPORTUNITIES ULTIMATELY. AND THOSE OPPORTUNITIES MEANS THAT WE NEED TO BE -- WE HAVE NEED TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE. AND WE NEED TO BE WELL REPRESENTED IN JUDICIAL COUNCIL. AB RIGHT WELL REPRESENTED IN CEDAR. WE NEED TO BE WELL REPRESENTATIVE NAH AS PROFESSORS IN THE LAW SCHOOLS. WHEN YOU BE WELL REPRESENTED -- HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND SO -- THE INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN IS. NOT ONLY HAVING THAT CONVERSATION BUT MAKING CERTAIN THAT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE MADE TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE QUALIFIED BECAUSE WE DO HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE WELL QUALIFIED TO TAKE THOSE POSITIONS OTHERS. I I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT AND I AM PART OF THE LET US A LAW STUDENTS ASSOCIATION AT UC DAVIS AND I HAVE BEEN PART OF MANY CLASSES. STUDENT ASSOCIATIONS -- THROUGH UNDERGRAD AS WELL AND I THINK ONE OF ONE OF THE REAL LEADERS FOR A LOT OF US HAS BEEN THE HEALTH THAT. I HAD TO TAKE IT TWICE TO BE ABLE TO GET INTO LAW SCHOOL WHILE WORKING FULL TIME. I DIDN'T EVEN GET A CHANCE TO FINISH. ALL THE SESSIONS BECAUSE I HAD TO WORK A JOB IN HALF AND SO. I THINK THAT -- THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE -- THERE NEEDS TO BE CHANGING HOW WE EVALUATE -- STUDENTS IN TERMS OF LIKE WHAT THEY HOW THEY QUALIFIED TO GET INTO LAW SCHOOL I THINK THAT ALL SIDE IS. IS. NOT NECESSARILY A GOOD MEASURE OF WHETHER YOU WILL SUCCEED IN LAW SCHOOL AND I THINK THAT. A LOT OF STUDENTS HAVE OTHER QUALITIES THAT THEY CAN OFFER THAT WILL DIVERSIFY THE LEGAL PROFESSION NOT JUST IN TERMS OF WHETHER YOU'RE A MINORITY OR NOT -- BUT I THINK THAT A LOT OF A LOT OF UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES BRINK QUALITIES FROM REAL LIFE THAT THEY CAN ADD -- TO THEIR PRACTICE IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION -- AND I AGREE WITH JUDGE MESSY AS IN TERMS OF OPPORTUNITY I THINK THAT -- I HAVE I WAS BLESSED WITH A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES ALONG THE WAY BUT I ALSO LOOKED FOR THEM. BECAUSE THEY WERE EASY TO FIND -- SO OPPORTUNITY RESOURCES IN THE AISLES THAT THANK YOU. I I'D SAY STATES -- SORT OF TWO THINGS ONE IT'S I THINK IT'S REALLY PART TO REMOVE BARRIERS. TO ENTER THE PRACTICE -- ECONOMIC VERY SIR BIG ONE FOR THE LP HE COMMUNITY AS WELL AS MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE UNDERREPRESENTED SELLING FOCUSING ON WAYS OF INCREASING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE NO MATTER WHAT COLLEGE YOU'RE GOING -- TO IT'S HOW IT'S ALWAYS HARDER AT THE LAW SCHOOL LEVEL AND SO THAT'S A BIG BARRIER FOR FOLKS. IN OUR COMMUNITY -- I THINK THE OTHER THING I WOULD SORT OF SAY IS CULTURAL COMES THE TRAINING IS IMPORTANT AND IT'S NOT ONLY IMPORTANT FROM LGBT Q. PERSPECTIVE BUT I THINK IT IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE GENERAL DIVERSITY TRAINING I MEAN -- THE KINDS OF STORIES THAT THE JUDGES TALKING ABOUT OF YOU KNOW ABOUT -- BEING YOU KNOW HEARING MESSAGES THAT -- YOU KNOW SHE SHOULDN'T BE REACHING FOR SOMETHING SHE WANTS TO DO -- I MEAN THOSE ARE YOU KNOW. NOT USING THE RIGHT LANGUAGE REFERRING TO LGBT Q. PEOPLE IN WAYS THAT ARE NOT RESPECTFUL THAT HAPPENS. IN ALL UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES AND SO THAT IS WHY WE HAVE BEEN SUCH. OF YOU KNOW PUSHING SO MUCH ON THE IMPORTANCE OF INCLUDE DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION TRAINING THAT INCLUDES ALL TO THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY BUT REALLY ALL UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR JUDGES. I MEAN THAT HAS AN IMPACT ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE COURT ROOM COURT STAFF -- AND EVEN IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION AMONG LAWYERS HAVE IN THERE IS -- YOU KNOW IT'S PART OF THE CONTINUING LEGAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS THERE IS SOME -- REQUIREMENTS ON AND ELIMINATION OF BIAS BUT GENERALLY THOSE PROGRAMS DOWN EXTENDS TO THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY AND THAT FRANKLY I THINK -- THERE WHICH WEEK GENERALLY BECAUSE SO MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE -- YOU KNOW GIVEN FOR BY FOR PROFIT OUTSIDE -- FOLKS IN THE QUALITY IS IN HIGH IN MY OPINION -- TO PAY YOU BACK A LITTLE BIT OFF OF PREVIOUS COMMENTS -- THE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT -- THINGS THE INSTITUTIONS CAN DO IS OPEN THE DOOR -- FOR THESE COMMUNITIES OF I WROTE I WANT TO THANK AGAIN THE CHAIR -- AND HIS STAFF HOME FOR INCLUDING THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY IN THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE SO OFTEN -- IN CONVERSATIONS LIKE THESE ONES THE DISABILITY COMMUNITIES LEFT OUT -- KIND OF FORGOTTEN ABOUT YOU KNOW WE THINK OF THE DIFFERENT CAUCUSES HERE IN THE BUILDING WE THINK OF OF THE BLACK CAUCUS OR THE A PR CAUCUS OF LATINO CAUCUS. BUT OFTEN TIMES OF THE DISABILITY -- GROUPS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INCLUDED IN AND NOT ONLY IS IT IMPORTANT TO HAVE -- THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY AT MY TABLE LIKE THIS ONE BUT ALSO HAVING THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY INCLUDED AT DECISION MAKING -- TABLES AS WELL -- TABLES WHERE -- PEOPLE CAN REALLY REALLY IMPACT CHANGE OF IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION -- I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT. IT WAS FOR ME GROWING UP BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT AFRICAN AMERICAN ATTORNEYS -- AFRICAN AMERICAN JUDGES OF AND KNOWING THAT BECAUSE THEY CAN DO IT I CAN DO IT -- AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME GROWING UP I DIDN'T SEE. VERY MANY OF ATTORNEYS ARE JUDGES WITH DISABILITIES -- THAT I COULD RELATE TO SO IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND AND I KNOW THAT. HOME. FOR MYSELF IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I PAY IT FORWARD AS WELL -- WHEN I SEE -- KIDS WITH DISABILITIES -- WHO ASPIRED TO TO BE GREAT -- INSPIRED TO DO AMAZING THINGS WHETHER IT'S AS A LOBBYIST. OR IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION OR ANY OTHER PROFESSION THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I ENCOURAGE THEM AND I SHOW THEM THAT THAT THEY CAN BE EXACTLY WHO THEY WANT TO BE. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AND I WANT TO JUST REFLECT ON THEM FOR A MOMENT BUT TO SAY. AN APOLOGY TO THE CHAIR WE ONLY HAVE TWO MORE DAYS -- BEFORE WE HAVE TO START VOTING ON HUNDREDS OF BILLS NEXT WEEK AND I KNOW -- THAT EVERYONE'S TRYING FRANTICALLY DO LAST MINUTE MEETINGS -- BUT I WILL SHARE THAT THIS VERY CONVERSATION IS ONE I'VE HAD OFTEN NOT JUST WITH LEGAL. LEADERS AROUND -- SO REST ASSURED WE ARE TO BE FOCUSED ON THIS TOPIC REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE ARE PHYSICALLY HERE NOT. ON A FEW THINGS I'M HOPING THE REST OF THIS HEARINGS GOING TO COVER -- ONE THAT THE TOPIC AROUND TESTS AND THE L. SAID IN A PARTICULAR THIS THE BAR EXAM. UP THE DATA IS VERY VERY CLEAR AND HOW THESE EXAMS SEEM TO BE BORING -- FUTURE LEADERS WITHIN THE LEGAL PROFESSION. THAT REPRESENT THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE AND IT IT'S IT'S IT'S A CONVERSATION I THINK WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO HAVE ITS ONE WERE ALL VERY CONCERNED ABOUT -- I THINK THEY'RE MANY REASONS ON BOTH SIDES OF Y. THING SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT CHANGE BUT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I THINK THE BURDEN OF PROOF SHOULD LIE WITH THE STATUS QUO BECAUSE THINGS HAVE TO CHANGE. THE SECOND SET OF QUESTIONS I REALLY DO HOPE ARE ANSWERED IN ON SOME OF THE PANELISTS ALLUDED TO THIS IS JUST. AGAIN HOW DO WE PUSH THE LEGAL PROFESSION IN EVERY PART OF THE PROFESSION TO GET MORE DIVERSE NOT JUST BROADLY RIGHT YOU CAN LOOK AT DATA ACROSS THE SPECTRUM. BUT WHAT CAN BE DONE SPECIFICALLY. WITHIN THE PRIVATE BAR AND LAW FIRMS TO MOVE THINGS FOR WHAT CAN BE DONE IN ACADEMIA WHAT CAN BE DONE AND GOVERNMENT. WHAT CAN BE DONE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST NONPROFIT SECTOR MY HOPE IS THERE WILL BE SUBSEQUENT PANELS THAT DIVE SPECIFICALLY INTO INTO THOSE QUESTIONS -- BLESSING WANT TO SAY IS THE GOOD JUDGE REFER TO OPPORTUNITIES AND HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS ARE AT THE TABLE AND WHAT I HAVE. MY MY CONCERN ABOUT THE MAJOR LEGAL INSTITUTIONS IN MOVEMENT FOR REFORM IS WE HAVEN'T SEEN. CHANGE YET. AND THESE ARE INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN AS DIVERSE AS WE NEED THEM TO BE THEMSELVES AND SO WHEN IT SUGGESTED FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL CAN LEAD ON THIS. THAT IS GREAT NEWS BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- A BENCH THAT IS BY AND LARGE STILL DOMINATED BY FOLKS THAT DON'T REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE AND SO MY QUESTION TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WOULD BE. HOW ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THINGS FORWARD -- GIVEN THE LACK OF DIVERSITY THAT THE INSTITUTIONAL FLEX -- TO THE STATE BAR I'LL JUST NOTE -- THERE HAVE BEEN SOME HEADWAY THIS YEAR AFTER BAR REFORMS WERE PUT INTO PLACE BY A STATE BAR PRESIDENT WHO REFLECTS THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE WHO HAPPENS. TO HAVE COME THROUGH SOME OF THE ETHNIC BARS THAT I WAS REFERRING -- TO AND YOU HAPPEN HAVE BEEN APPOINTED TO HIS POSITION. AFTER THE STATE BAR FORMS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE AND I'M CONCERNED THAT AFTER HE LEAVES -- I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT CONTINUITIES GOING TO EXIST WITHIN THE STATE PARTY WITH THE SPORTS SO MY HOPE IS TO COME BACK TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS DIRECTLY IN FUTURE PANELS BUT IF I'M NOT ABLE TO GET BACK -- I DO HOPE MY STAFF WILL BE HERE WILL BE MONITORING AND WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH THIS. THE LAST THING I'LL JUST SAY IS THERE A LOT OF GREAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME TOGETHER TODAY FOR THIS HEARING THE THE CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF YOU PUT TOGETHER AN AMAZING LAST. I'D LOVE TO JUST LITERALLY LOCK EVERYONE IN A ROOM. AB THIS ROOM. UNTIL YOU ALL FIGURED OUT. BECAUSE I TRULY THINK THE ANSWERS ARE PROBABLY IN THIS ROOM ON AND WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS A LOT OF IDEAS WILL COME OUT OF THIS AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THE HEAD WITH THAT WE NEED -- BUT I WILL BE LOOKING WORKING WITH THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL AS AS IF YOU IN THE AUDIENCE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE MOVE THIS BECAUSE CALIFORNIA CAN LEAD WE NEED TO LEAD. WE REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF THE WORLD HERE WE ARE ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF SO MANY THINGS AND YET OUR OUR LEGAL PROFESSION. IS IS IS IS PROBABLY STILL STUCK A COUPLE DECADES BACK. AND IT'S UP TO US TO BE THE CHANGE THAT WE WANT AND I DO BELIEVE AND KNOW THAT EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM. INCLUDING FOLKS FROM THE MAJOR INSTITUTIONS AS WELL AS FOLKS ON THE OUTSIDE. OUR 1000% COMMITTED TO FIGURE THIS OUT SO LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH THAT WANT TO DO THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THIS PANEL I GUESS JUST A COUPLE CLOSING THOUGHTS MS BUT THE ROSA. THIS COMMITTEE LOVES TO GET IN TURN. SO YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THAT IT AND MISTER HARRIS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I THINK WE HAVE WITH THE DIVERT THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY. IS THAT THE ENTIRE LEGISLATURE IS ABLE BY. SO PERHAPS YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT COMING UP IN JOINING US. AT SOME POINT IN IT KERRY THAT VOICE FORWARD WHICH IS EXACTLY THE POINT OF YES WE NEED TO DO MORE. TRAINING AND REDUCING BIAS AND ALL BUT UNTIL. A BODY LIKE THIS OR PROFESSION. LOOKS LIKE CALIFORNIA AND HAS SOMEBODY THERE REMINDING US AS WE DO POLICY IT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THOSE. VIEW POINTS PUT FORWARD. SO IT'S TO PROD THE EDUCATION YES THE DATA COLLECTION ABSOLUTELY BUT ALSO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO WORK TO MISTER CHOOSE POINT MAKING SURE THAT. THE LEGAL PROFESSION ACROSS THE BOARD. LOOKS LIKE CALIFORNIA AND WILL THEN START TO BE SEEMING MORE WELCOMING BECAUSE IT WILL BETTER AS A BODY UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES THAT IT'S FACING AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET A SO THANK YOU. AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE NEXT ISSUE WHICH IS REALLY TALKING A LOT ABOUT. THE PIPELINE. AND THE THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE WITH THE ARTIFICIAL HURDLES THAT KEEP PEOPLE OUT AND AND WE WERE NOT. PREPARING PEOPLE ALWAYS. TO BE THEIR THEIR BEST INTO THE PROFESSION. SO WE HAVE A NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO WILL BE JOINING US LANDING KLEIN WHO IS A FELLOW. WITH THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HERE. WE HAVE MIKEL KERR LANDER PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA DAVIS TO TALK ABOUT ISSUES IN THE EARLY PART OF THIS PIPELINE. KELLY SIMS BUTLER. ASSISTANT DEAN GRADUATE STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA DAVIS TALKING ABOUT LATER PARTS OF THE PIPELINE. SONG RICHARDSON DEAN OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA IRVINE SCHOOL OF LAW TALKING ABOUT EXACTLY THE CUT SCORE. AND WE'RE VERY HONORED TO HAVE JUST AS GOOD IN LIEU OF THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. HERE TO TALK ABOUT. CAREER ADVANCEMENT AND DIVERSITY I KNOW IS VERY HIGH ON JUSTICE LOSE. LIST OF ISSUES WITHIN THE LEGAL PROFESSION THAT HE IS WORKING ON SOLVING. RIGHT DOCTOR KLEIN. AT FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY AND FOR HAVING ALL THESE WONDERFUL PEOPLE TOGETHER AND I I WANT TO TAKE THINK THE FIRST PANEL -- FOR THEIR REMARKABLE TESTIMONY AND I THINK THAT NOW THAT WE'VE HEARD A BIT ABOUT THE PERSONAL DIFFICULTIES THAT ARE FACED BY A DIVERSE POPULATIONS IN ACCESSING THE LEGAL PROFESSION -- IT'S SORT OF USEFUL TO FRAME THE REST OF OUR DISCUSSION TODAY. WITH SOME OF THAT THE STATISTICS IDENTIFYING JUST EXACTLY WHAT THE SCOPE OF UNDER REPRESENTATION IS IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND THE JUDICIARY AS A WHOLE -- I WANNA GIVE A BIT OF A DISCLAIMER HERE THAT -- IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'M GOING TO FOCUS PRIMARILY ON RACIAL DIVERSITY -- BUT THAT THIS IS NOT. TO DISCOUNT THE IMPORTANCE OF FOR EXAMPLE LGBT Q. ADD DIVERSITY TRANS GENDER DIVERSITY DISABILITY PER DIVERSITY AND THE LIKE -- WE DO HAVE SOME STATISTICS ON THAT IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER FOR THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING IF YOU'RE INTERESTED AND I'M ALSO HAPPY TO DISCUSS THAT -- DURING THE QUESTIONING PERIOD. SO. THE LEGAL PROFESSION IS AMONG THE LEAST DIVERSE PROFESSIONS IN THE NATION -- AND IF YOU LOOK UP HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT -- WITH SEVERAL OTHER PROFESSIONS THAT REQUIRE SIMILAR AMOUNTS OF TRAINING AND PROFICIENCY AT LEGAL PROFESSION NONETHELESS FALLS SHORT IN TERMS OF REPRESENTATION OF PEOPLE OF COLOR -- SO ABOUT BETWEEN A QUARTER AND A THIRD OF PHYSICIANS FOR EXAMPLE ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND YET ONLY 12% OF LAWYERS NATIONALLY ARE COMPRISED OF PEOPLE OF COLOR -- WHAT CALIFORNIA'S LAWYERS ARE MARGINALLY MORE DIVERSE THAN THE NATION'S AS A WHOLE WITH 80% BEING WHITE VERSUS 88% NATIONWIDE -- WHEN YOU CONSIDER THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF CALIFORNIA'S UNIQUELY DIVERSE DEMOGRAPHICS WITH ONLY 37% BEING WHITE COMPARED 273% IN THE NATION AS A WHOLE -- IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT MINORITY UNDER REPRESENTATION IN CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS IS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC -- AND THIS IS TRUE IN SPITE OF SEVERAL EFFORTS BY THE LEGISLATURE BY THE FORMER GOVERNOR AND VARIOUS NON PROFITS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. TO ATTEMPT TO INCREASE DIVERSITY WITHIN THE LEGAL PROFESSION -- IT IS TRUE THAT. SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE THERE HAVE BEEN MARGINAL INCREASES IN ATTORNEYS OF COLOUR AT YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE QUITE SMALL HERE BUT NONE THE LESS AT THAT TREND IS MOVING IN THE CORRECT DIRECTION -- BUT THIS IMPROVEMENT AT BEST ONLY KEEPS PACE WITH THE DEMOGRAPHIC THE DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THESE CHANGES OVER TIME WHEN CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THE PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION. WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE AN INCREASE SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE IN THE OVER REPRESENTATION OF WHITE INDIVIDUALS IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND IF YOU LOOK AT FURTHER DOWN HERE. AT WE CAN SEE HOW THIS WORKS AND WE CAN SEE THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY A RELATIVELY FLAT LINE FROM 200-012-2017 IN TERMS OF THE REPRESENTATION AS A PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR -- THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE AND HOPEFULLY THE REST OF THE PANELS TODAY WE'LL DISCUSS THESE IN MORE DETAIL -- BUT I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT VERY BRIEFLY ON ONE OF THESE POSSIBLE BOTTLENECKS IN TERMS OF DIVERSITY. IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND THAT'S RACIAL DISPARITIES IN BAR EXAM PARTICIPATION AND PASSAGE RATES. I'M [inaudible] SO. I'M JUST HIGHLIGHTING A SINGLE ONE OF THESE ISSUES BUT IT'S VERY CLEAR HERE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS FIRST CHART. THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF CALIFORNIA BAR EXAM TEST TAKERS AT AS A FUNCTION OF THE PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION IS ALREADY QUITE UNEQUAL ACROSS DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS SO YOU CAN SEE THAT Y. AN API INDIVIDUALS ARE. FAIRLY WELL REPRESENTED IN TERMS OF CALIFORNIA BAR EXAM TEST TAKERS. BLACK INDIVIDUALS ARE ABOUT EVEN WITH THE POPULATION AND HISPANIC INDIVIDUALS. AS WE SEE IN BASED ON SOME OF THE HURDLES THAT THEY FACE PERSONALLY -- SEEM TO FALL QUITE SHORT IN TERMS OF REPRESENTATION HERE. AT BUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT ACT XIN ISN'T NECESSARY ON THE BAR EXAM AS A WHOLE IN ORDER TO ADDRESS ISSUES ACROSS VARIOUS RACES -- SO IF WE LOOK AT THE BAR EXAM PASSAGE RIGHT ACROSS DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS AT WE CAN SEE THAT ABOUT 60% OF WHITE INDIVIDUALS IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BAR EXAM. AT PASSED IN THIS IS COMPARED TO ABOUT 32% OF BLACK INDIVIDUALS AND IN THE UPPER FORTIES FOR A. B. I. R. HISPANIC INDIVIDUALS -- AND JUST DEMONSTRATING THAT THE HISPANIC DEMOGRAPHIC SEEMS. THERE'S BEEN A DEMOGRAPHIC SEATS TO SUFFER -- PREDOMINATELY FROM A LACK OF PARTICIPATION AND WE CAN SEE THAT A MULTI FACETED APPROACH IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO ENCOMPASS -- SORT OF ALL OF THESE DIVERSE GROUPS IN TERMS OF INCREASING REPRESENTATION IN THE JUDICIAL PROFESSION -- AND THAT CONSIDERING DIVERSITY SORT OF MONOLITHIC LEE IS NOT NECESSARILY THE CORRECT APPROACH. IT IS ALSO THE CASE THAT WESEE SOME BOTTLENECKS IN TERMS OF CAREER ADVANCEMENT AMONG WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR AND THE LEGAL PROFESSION -- SO WE CAN SEE THAT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE PERCENTAGE OF ASSOCIATES WALLETS REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT ACROSS AT THE PAST. DECADE OR SO. WE CAN NONETHELESS SEE THAT WHITE MEN COMPRISE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE POPULATION OF ASSOCIATES IN THE FIRST PLACE AT REFLECTING SORT OF THE LACK OF DIVERSITY IN THE GYM AND THE LEGISLATIVE. ART I'M SORRY IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION AS A WHOLE -- BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGE OF PARTNERS IS DRAMATICALLY DOMINATED BY WHITE MEN AND WE CAN SEE THAT THERE'S A SOMEWHAT NEGLIGIBLE PERCENTAGE OF PARTNERS THAT THESE LAW FIRMS. AT AT THE AT THE BOTTOM HERE AB THAT HAS CHANGED VERY LITTLE OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS -- IT'S TEMPTING TO ATTRIBUTE THE DEARTH OF MINORITY PARTNERS TO A LACK AN IMPENDING DIVERSITY IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE SOME DIVERSITY IMPROVEMENTS THAT. HAVE NOT YET TAKEN EFFECT AS PEOPLE CRITICS APPEARANCE AT BUT THIS EXPLANATION DOESN'T SEEM TO BE REFLECTED BY THESE DATA AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S VERY LITTLE INCREASE -- IN THESE VARIOUS RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS FOR OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS AND THIS IS IN CONTRAST TO WOMEN WHICH HAVE AT LEAST THAT VERY. MARGINAL BUT GRADUAL INCREASE HERE THAT MAY REFLECT SOME DIVERSITY EFFORTS -- THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT WOMEN IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION ARE BEING WELL REPRESENTED IN TERMS OF THE PERCENTAGE OF PARTNERS -- SO THAT VERY GRADUAL INCREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF OF WOMEN PARTNERS IS NONETHELESS IN THE CONTEXT OF A MUCH MORE DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF ATTORNEYS WHO ARE WOMEN IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION -- AND YOU CAN SEE A SORT OF COALESCING AND GENDER IDENTITY -- OF OF CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY SINCE NINETEEN NINETY ONE WHILE IT STILL DOESN'T QUITE REFLECT THE POPULATION AND IT'S AT LEAST TRAINING IN THE CORRECT DIRECTION -- BUT THIS NONETHELESS UNDERSCORE SOME OF THE OBSTACLES THAT AT WOMEN ACTUALLY FACE IN TERMS OF CAREER ADVANCEMENT -- AND THESE LIMITATIONS AND CAREER ADVANCEMENT ARE OFTEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT WOMEN TAKE MATERNAL LEAVE AND THEREFORE TAKE TIME OUT OF THE LABOR FORCE. AT WHICH DOLLARS THEIR CAREER ADVANCEMENT BUT THE DAY DON'T SEEM TO SUPPORT THAT SO EVEN AMONG WOMEN WHO WORK SIMILAR HOURS AND DON'T TAKE TIME OUT OF THE LABOR FORCE TO HAVE CHILDREN. AB THEY'RE STILL ABOUT 40% LESS LIKELY THAN SIMILARLY SITUATED MAN TO FIND THEIR WAY INTO THE POSITION OF A PARTNER. AND THOSE LIMITATIONS AND LEGAL CAREER ADVANCEMENT AMONG PEOPLE OF COLOR AREN'T LIMITED TO PRIVATE LAW FIRMS AND REACHING PARTNER BUT ALSO SEEM TO EXTEND TO THE BENCH -- THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION MADE DIVERSIFYING THE JUDICIARY A PRIORITY AND INDEED DID INCREASE DIVERSITY IN JUDICIAL REPRESENTATION AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE A LITTLE BIT HERE THERE'S SOME UP TICK AT THE COMBINATION OF THAT ADMINISTRATION AT THE END -- BUT THESE HAVE LARGELY OVER THE PAST DECADE AND A HALF. KEPT PACE WITH BUT NOT EXCEEDED THE DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA -- AS OF TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY COURTS ARE EXCLUSIVELY WHITE. TWELVE EXCLUSIVELY MALE AND TEN CONSIST EXCLUSIVELY OF WHITE HETEROSEXUAL ABLE BODIED MALES -- SO CLEARLY THERE'S STILL A LONG WAY TO GO IN TERMS OF INCREASING THE ACTAL REPRESENTATION OF PEOPLE OF COLOR ON THE BENCH. AND ONE THING THAT'S WORTH NOTING HERE. SORRY I WILL CLOSE UP QUITE QUICKLY I ONE THING THAT'S WORTH NOTING HERE IS THAT BLACK JUDGES HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT STRIDES IN TERMS OF REPRESENTATION MOVING FROM BEING UNDER REPRESENTED IN THE POPULATION TO ACTUAL SLIDE OVER REPRESENTATION -- BUT THIS DIVERSITY IS EXTREMELY LIMITED IN TERMS OF GEOGRAPHY WITH ONLY FORTY ONE OF CALIFORNIANS. I'M SORRY WITH FORTY ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY TRIAL COURT STILL NOT HAVING A SINGLE BLACK JURIST -- SO THAT'S HOW IT'S THAT ALTHOUGH WE'VE SEEN SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN GEOGRAPHICALLY LIMITED SCOPES AND IT'S NECESSARY TO CONTINUE AND EXPAND THESE DIVERSITY EFFORTS IN ORDER TO HAVE. SORT OF A STATE WIDE AB POPULATION OF JUDGES THAT REFLECTS THE DIVERSITY OF THE STATE AS A WHOLE AND I'LL STOP THERE IN THE INTEREST OF TIME. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK THANK YOU THIS IS UNDERSCORES WHY WE LOVE HAVING A SCIENCE FELLOW. IN THE COMMITTEE TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS KIND OF DATA RESEARCH. PROFESSOR KARLAN -- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. THE GOALS OF MY REMARKS ARE TWO FOLD FIRST I'D LIKE TO PROVIDE SOME BROADER CONTEXTUAL FRAMING FOR EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN THE STATE. WHICH SETS THE STAGE FOR UNDERSTANDING THE EDUCATIONAL TRAJECTORIES. AB AND DISPARITIES IN EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT WE SEE PRIMARILY BY RACE ETHNICITY BUT ALSO BY SOCIO ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE. AND SECOND I WILL UMMARIZE WHAT WE KNOW TO BE THE BIGGEST DETERMINANTS OF EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT AM INCLUDING ACT PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL. SO FIRST DAY TWO MINUTE I THINK PRIMER OF EDUCATIONAL EQUALITY. EDUCATION IS OFTEN VIEWED AS AN INDIVIDUAL PURSUIT BE HEARD SOME OF THAT THIS MORNING EDUCATIONAL PATHWAYS ARE MARKED. BY A SERIES OF CHOICES THAT INDIVIDUALS MAKE THAT SHAPE THEIR DESTINATIONS HOW MANY HONORS OR AP CLASSES TO TAKE HOW MUCH TO STUDY WHERE TO APPLY FOR COLLEGE WHAT TO MAJOR IN. AND WHETHER AND WHERE TO PURSUE GRADUATE STUDY. AND THIS VIEW PERMEATES OUR NARRATIVE OF EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AT THE IDEA THAT IF YOU WORK HARD AT SCHOOL ANYONE CAN AND OUT THAT. PICTURE ELITE SCHOOL OR BECOME A LAWYER OR FILL IN THE BLANK. THAT REALITY OF INDIVIDUAL CHOICE AND SELF DETERMINATION HOWEVER IS AT BEST MISLEADING. AND AT TO A VERY LARGE EXTENT BASICALLY UNTRUE. IN FACT RESEARCHERS HAVE REPEATEDLY DOCUMENTED THE WAYS IN WHICH INDIVIDUAL CHOICES ARE CONSTRAINED BY MULTIPLE SOCIETAL FORCES AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS THAT SORT YOUNG PEOPLE. AMONG AN EQUAL PATHWAYS OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY. THESE CONSTRAIN CHOICES THAT TYPIFY OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM FROM EARLY CHILDHOOD INTO POST SECONDARY AND PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLING IN THE U. S.. AND THEY'RE BOTH EXPLICIT INVISIBLE AS WELL AS MORE HIDDEN AND LESS VISIBLE BARRIERS. STUDENTS SCHOOLING EXPERIENCES IS THE DOMINANT WAYS IN WHICH EDUCATIONAL PATHWAYS ARE MARKED. MORE EXPLICITLY SCHOOL QUALITY AND CURRICULAR DIFFERENCES SORT. STUDENTS INTO EDUCATIONAL SETTINGS THAT DIFFER BY SUBSTANTIVE CONTENT PACE OF INSTRUCTION PEDAGOGICAL APPROACHES AND MANY OTHER RESOURCES. AND THIS DIFFERENCE IN START DIFFERENTIATION STARTS WITH ACCESS TO PRESCHOOL ENVIRONMENTS WHICH ARE HEARING MORE AND MORE ABOUT THESE DAYS THAT PROMOTE SCHOOL READINESS. GATEKEEPING COURSES IN MIDDLE SCHOOL YEARS RIGOROUS HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULA TO FACILITATE SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION INTO POST SECONDARY SCHOOLING. AND FINALLY SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF A COLLEGE DEGREE WITH A COMPETITIVE GPA AND PREPARATION FOR ADMITTANCE TO A PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL. AND WE'VE MADE GREAT EFFORTS TO EQUALIZE SOME OF THIS DIFFERENTIATION WHEN VISIBLE STATE FUNDED PRESCHOOL OUR SCHOOL FUNDING FORMULA. INCREASED ADVANCED PLACEMENT OFFERINGS IN SCHOOLS THAT SERVE AT LARGE PERCENTAGES OF SENSE ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS. BUT IN MANY CASES ACCESS TO GOOD INSTRUCTION OR OTHER COLLEGE PREPARATORY OPPORTUNITIES ARE LESS VISIBLE THESE INCLUDE UNEQUAL ACCESS TO SUCH COURSES WITH IN A SCHOOL. LESS ENCOURAGEMENT TO PARTICIPATE IN THOSE COURSES AND IN GENERAL LACK OF EXPOSURE TO THE PROFESSIONAL NETWORKS NECESSARY. TO REACH SOME OF THESE -- GATEKEEPING AT SPACES. SO STUDENTS ARE NOT RANDOMLY PLACED INTO THEIR EDUCATIONAL PATHWAYS BUT RATHER THEIR PATHWAYS ARE SHAPED YES BY THEIR INDIVIDUAL DETERMINATION BUT IMPORTANTLY BY THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY ARE EXPOSED. TO AND THE RESULT IS THAT EDUCATIONAL PATHWAYS TEND TO SELF PERPETUATE. THAT IS QUALITY EARLY SCHOOLING EXPERIENCES BEGET BETTER PLACEMENT INTO SECONDARY SCHOOL DECISIONS. AND THEN MORE INTENSE ACADEMIC RIGOR IN HIGH SCHOOL THAT RESULTS IN MORE SELECTIVE COLLEGE ADMISSION. AND GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF DEGREE ATTAINMENT IT TO BEGIN WITH BUT ALSO PROFESSIONS FURTHER PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLING OR LABOR MARKET SUCCESS. SO THE PRIMARY WAY IN WHICH EDUCATORS AND POLICYMAKERS HOPE TO BREAK THIS SELF PERPETUATING NATURE OF EDUCATIONAL PATHWAYS. AND IMPROVE MOBILITY BETWEEN EDUCATIONAL DESTINATIONS IS THROUGH INCREASED ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITIES. HOWEVER TOO OFTEN WE RELY ON THE SET OF INPUTS THAT DIRECTLY REFLECT THAT ACCUMULATED ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES BETTER REFLECTED IN THAT SAT SCORE OR ELSE OUT SCORE OR THE SELECTIVITY OF THE UNDERGRADUATE INSTITUTION. AND AS A RESULT THE RACIAL ETHNIC OR SOCIOECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE GAP THAT WE SEE ON THESE ASSESSMENTS AND HERE I SPEAK TO STANDARDIZED TESTS IN PARTICULAR. ARE SIMPLY HOLDING UP A MIRROR TO THE INEQUITIES IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AND IN SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. SO ALTHOUGH HIGHER EDUCATION AND LEGAL EDUCATION IN THIS CASE MAY NOT SEE ITSELF AS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE THESE INEQUALITIES. THE ONLY WAY TO REDUCE THESE INEQUALITIES IS TO EQUALIZE EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES EARLIER AND STUDENTS EDUCATIONAL CAREERS. SO WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT DETERMINES OF EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. SUMMARIZING ABROAD AND MULTI DISCIPLINARY LITERATURE ON PREDICTORS OF POSTSECONDARY SUCCESS INCLUDING GRADUATE STUDY I WOULD SAY THERE ARE THREE MAIN BUCKETS. THE FIRST IS ACADEMIC PREPARATION STUDENTS EXPOSED TO A MORE ACADEMICALLY RIGOROUS COURSE OF STUDY ARE BETTER PREPARED FOR THE DEMANDS OF COLLEGE AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO COMPLETE COLLEGE. AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL THIS IMPACTS GRADUATE STUDY IN SEVERAL WAYS FIRST IS OBVIOUSLY PREPARATION FOR LAW SCHOOL OR ANY OTHER GRADUATE SCHOOL. WHICH IS OFTEN POORLY UNDERSTOOD BUT WE PROXY FOR IT BY THE SELECTIVITY OF THE UNDERGRADUATE INSTITUTION OUR COLLEGE GPA. HOWEVER STUDENTS OFTEN ENTER COLLEGE WITH THIS AN EQUAL PREPARATION MANY STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN A STRONG ENOUGH GPA TO BE COMPETITIVE FOR LAW SCHOOL. OR ARE SIMPLY SELF SELECTING OUT OF GRADUATE STUDY GIVEN THE CONSISTENT NEGATIVE SIGNALS THEY GET FROM THE GRADES IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE SECOND BUCKET IS ON COLLEGE OR GRADUATE SCHOOL KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION. THERE ARE A HOST OF INFORMATIONAL BARRIERS THAT PRESENT A CHALLENGE TO HISTORICALLY UNDER REPRESENTED GROUPS AND POST SECONDARY SCHOOLING. THESE INCLUDE INFORMATION ABOUT COSTS AND EDUCATION FINANCING KNOWLEDGE OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF GRADUATE SCHOOL OPTIONS FIELDS OF STUDY AND APPLICATION PROCEDURES AND I COULD GO ON NOT -- AND THESE INFORMATION BARRIERS ARE THE ONES WE HERE WE HEARD SOME TODAY OUR OUR OUR EFFORTS AT AT PROGRAMS OF TRYING TO REMEDY. FINALLY THE OTHER BUCKET IS KIND OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS IT'S HARD TO DO THIS BROAD AREA OF JUSTICE. IT IS BROAD AREA JUSTICE IN A FEW SENTENCES BUT IN SHORT NAVIGATING COLLEGE AND GRADUATE SCHOOL CAN BE HARD. NO MATTER HOW WELL PREPARED YOU ARE ACADEMICALLY OR HOW MUCH INFORMATION YOU HAVE. AND SCHOLARS FROM ACROSS THE SOCIAL SCIENCE DISCIPLINES HAVE DOCUMENTED THE NEED TO CULTIVATE A SENSE OF RESILIENCE AND SELF ADVOCACY NECESSARY. FOR CAL FOR COLLEGE AND GRADUATE SCHOOL SUCCESS AND WHICH WE KNOW IS EVEN HARDER FOR STUDENTS WHO MAY BE THE FIRST IN THEIR FAMILIES TO GO TO COLLEGE OR GRADUATE SCHOOL HAVE TO WORK WHILE THEY'RE IN SCHOOL. OR MAY NOT HAVE THE MANY PEERS OR MENTORS THAT COME FROM RACIAL ETHNIC OR SAYS OR SOCIAL BACKGROUNDS LIKE THEIR OWN. THESE THREE AREAS ARE OFTEN THE TARGET OF VARIOUS PIPELINE PROGRAMS THAT ASSIST UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS FROM HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS. WITH A HOST OF ACADEMIC SUPPORTS INCREASED INFORMATION ABOUT OUT ALL ASPECTS OF GRADUATE STUDY FROM APPLICATION MEETING HOW TO MEET WITH A FACULTY MEMBER TO ASK FOR A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION. AND TO UNDERSTAND THE PROFESSION MORE GENERALLY. AND VARIOUS EFFORTS FOR SELF AFFIRMATION AND SOCIAL BELONG EXPERIENCES ACT AGAIN ARE HUGELY CRITICAL -- FOR PARTICULARLY CERTAIN SUBGROUPS SO IN SOME HIGHER EDUCATION INCLUDING GRADUATE STUDY CAN DISREGARD OR IGNORED WHAT CAME BEFORE WHICH MAY SEEM PREFERABLE GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY. BUT MOST HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING LAW SCHOOLS FEEL SOME RESPONSIBILITY TO ADDRESS THESE DEEP INEQUITIES THAT RESULT IN THE KINDS OF ADMISSIONS PROFILE THAT THE SEAT. SO HOW THEY DO SO HAS IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES NOT JUST FOR THE CURRENT STUDENTS BUT FOR MANY STUDENTS TO CALM. AND ADMISSION IS ONLY ONE ASPECT OF THIS EFFORT I'LL BE AN IMPORTANT ONE BUT SUSTAIN SUPPORT THROUGH GRADUATE STUDY IN. AN INTO THE PROFESSION REQUIRES EARLIER INVESTMENTS IN ACADEMIC PREPARATION IN REDUCING INFORMATIONAL BARRIERS AT IN CULTIVATING THE ENVIRONMENT THAT IS INCLUSIVE AND WELCOMING TO HISTORICALLY IS STARKLY UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS. SO WHILE IT IS ALWAYS INSPIRING FOR ME AS WELL TO HEAR THE STORIES OF PERSONAL STORIES IN PARTICULAR. HAVE THE CURRENT STUDENT KAREN BUT RAZA -- IT IS TIME THAT WE MOVE BEYOND JUST THAT THE BEAT THE ODDS STORY TO COMPLETELY CHANGE CHANGE THOUGHT SO. STOP [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] GREAT. WE ARE TO TEAM BUTLER. PLEASE GOOD MORNING. SO -- I WAS ACTS TO SPEAK ON UNDERSTANDING THE SCOPE OF THIS PROBLEM IN THE CONTEXT OF THE GRE AND I AM HERE REPRESENTING A PROJECT AS WELL SO I WANTED TO SAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT AND THEN I'LL GET INTO. A DISCUSSION BUT I'M PART OF A OF A OF THREE CAMPUS PROJECT THAT IS LOOKING AT THE ISSUE THAT YOU ALL ARE LOOKING AT HERE IN THE LEGAL EDUCATION IT'S THE ALLIANCE FOR MULTI CAMPUS INCLUSIVE GRADUATE ADMISSIONS -- WE CALL IT A MICAH AT UC DAVIS AS THE LEAD CAMPUS WITH -- PROVOST RALPH TEXTER AS THE PI IN ONE OF THE DIVERSITY OFFICERS WITHIN THE GRAD DIVISION JUST OF THE MONEY AND ALL AS THE CO PI. AND WE ALSO HAVE PARTNERS AT UCLA AND USC AND THIS QUESTION IS HAS A RESIDENT HIGHER EDUCATION REGARDING STANDARDIZED TESTING AND THE BEAR YEARS THAT IT IS CREATING. FOR DIVERSE STUDENTS ACROSS THE THE PLANE AND HOW THEY ARE ABLE TO ACCESS -- HIGHER EDUCATION WHETHER IT BE GRADUATE SCHOOL PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL AND AND HOW IMPORTANT OR IMPERATIVE IT IS THAT OUR PROFESSIONALS. ARE ACTUALLY. MATCHING OUR DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATIONS ACROSS OUR STATE IN OUR NATION AND SO -- OUR GOAL IN THE PROJECT IS TO REALLY TRY. TO FIND A WAY THAT WE CAN MAKE THAT DISTRIBUTION OF THE POPULATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHEN I SAW THIS TOPIC ONE I WAS NOT A WEIRD THAT WITHIN THE LEGAL PROFESSION THE CONTEXT WAS CHANGING IN THE SENSE THAT THERE WAS AN AD INTEREST IN DIVERSIFYING ADMISSIONS. TO LAW SCHOOL. IN AN INTEREST TO DIVERSIFY THAT PROCESS THE GRE THE GRADUATE RECORD EXAM WAS LOOK TO AS THE POSSIBILITY TO OFFER THIS -- OPPORTUNITY HOWEVER WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF GRADUATE EDUCATION WE ARE QUESTIONING THE USE AND DE EMPHASIZING THE USE OF THE GRE. SO I WILL APPROACH IT THIS WAY AND I THINK YOU ALL HAPPENED THE HAND OUTS HERE I'M I APOLOGIZE TO THOSE OUT IN THE AUDIENCE BUT THE PROBLEM HOW CAN WE IN CALIFORNIA INCREASE THE DIVERSITY OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND THE DUDE. JUDICIARY -- BASICALLY THE ARGUMENTS THAT I SAW TO BE THE DRIVING FORCES THAT THE G. R. E. WHAT X. BAN ACCESS TO LEGAL EDUCATION THE POOL OF TEST TAKERS IT'S WITHIN THE JURY ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN THOSE. WITHIN THE ELSE THAT. HOWEVER I WILL SHARE THAT THE DIVERSE CITY ACROSS IT'S NOT -- ANY MORE DIVERSE ACROSS THE GRE AND THE JET THE GRE TEST HAS ALSO BEEN EVALUATED AS BEING BALLOT AND RELIABLE -- HOWEVER BIASED -- SO THE DIVERSITY TOOL THE G. R. E.. TEST TAKERS THERE ARE OVER THREE TIMES TO FOUR TIMES AS MANY TEST TAKERS OF THE GRE COMPARED TO THE L. SAID. SO I THINK THE ARGUMENT THAT THE POOL OF APPLICANTS COULD INCREASE IS BALLOT. HOWEVER THERE IS A QUESTION ACROSS THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE POPULATION WHO ARE TAKING THE TEST AND THEY ALMOST NEAR EACH OTHER SO WITH IN THE ELSE THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT 80% OF THE TEST TAKERS. WHITE THE SAME EXIST WITH THE G. R. E. WHEN YOU LOOK AT U. S. DOMESTIC TEST TAKERS. THE DISTRIBUTION OF ASIAN. AMERICANS IS SLIGHTLY INCREASED IN THE GRE BUT 12214% ONLY 8% IN THE L. SAT WITH AFRICAN AMERICANS -- BEING ABOUT THE SAME DISTRIBUTION 12214% ACROSS BOTH THE JURY AND THE L. SAT AND THEN -- LATIN X. MEXICAN% HISPANIC NON WHITE. TEST TAKERS ARE SLIGHTLY HIGHER IN THE L. SAP VERSES THE G. R. E. WITH ONLY ABOUT. 628% TAKING THE GRE AND 10% TAKING THE L. SAT NATIVE AMERICANS ARE ALSO OVER REPRESENT AND TAKING THE L. FAT VERSUS TAKING THE GRE WITH ABOUT 10%. OF NATIVE AMERICANS TAKING THE TEST VERSUS 4% [inaudible] TAKING -- THAT JERRY. SO I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT THERE IS SOME. POSSIBILITY OF INCREASING DIVERSITY HOWEVER I WANT TO CAUTION WHEN WE SPEAK TO DIVERSITY IN USING TOOLS. TO DO THE WORK FOR US BECAUSE OF THEIR LIMITATIONS AND POSSIBLY -- BUT DISPARITIES THAT EXIST IN THE JURY'S -- SCORES SO THE GRE TEST REFLECT DISPARITIES AS MY COLLEAGUE MCCALL HAS MENTIONED THAT MIRROR BASICALLY THE SOCIO ECONOMIC -- DIFFERENCES DIFFERENCES ACROSS RACIAL BOUNDS OF POVERTY -- GENDER DIFFERENCES IN AND IT. HAS NOT BEEN CLEAR OF HOW TO CORRECT THE DIFFERENCES IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE GRE TEST AND SO WE WANT TO CAUTION AS WE'RE USING THIS TOOL. IN OUR ADMISSIONS PROCESS. I HAVE A GRAPHIC THAT I'VE SHARED JUST SO YOU CAN VISUALLY SEE IN THOSE WHO HAVE. THE PACKET THAT BASICALLY IF YOU JUST LOOK ACROSS THE DISTRIBUTION WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS ASIAN AMERICANS WHITES. OTHER HISPANIC A MEXICAN AFRICAN AMERICANS PORTER RICANS THE NATIVE AMERICANS ARE DIFFERENTIALLY DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE BOARD ON THEIR SCORES OF THE G. R. E.. N. IF WE HAVE CERTAIN SCORES ARE CUT OFF THEN HUGE POPULATIONS ARE DISADVANTAGED AUTOMATICALLY IF WE'RE USING THE SCORES AS OUR PRIMARY INDICATOR OF SUCCESS IN OUR ADMISSIONS PROCESS THE CONTINUING ALTHOUGH THE JURY PROVIDES A A LARGER POOL. OF APPLICANTS FOR LAW SCHOOL THE DIP TO HIGHLIGHT THE THE LIMITATIONS OF THE POOR PERFORMANCE DIFFERENTIALS ACROSS THE APPLICANTS THE JURY IS ONLY MODESTLY PREDICTIVE OF STUDENT SUCCESS. AND THIS IS REALLY CLEAR EVEN ETS EDUCATIONAL TESTING SERVICE ALSO STATES THAT THE JURY ONLY MODESTLY PREDICTS SUCCESS AND IT'S TYPICALLY THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF COURSEWORK. FOR STUDENTS NOT REALLY PREDICTING SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT WERE MOST INTERESTED IN WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT STUDENTS AND THEIR ABILITIES TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN GRADUATE EDUCATION. AND PERSIST BEYOND -- GRADUATE SCHOOL. I'M GONNA TRY TO GO FASTER HAD LOTS TO SAY -- IN IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE NOTE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED BY SCHOLARS IS THAT. WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE SCORES AND DISTRIBUTION IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE CONSIDER CHANGING THE CULTURES WHICH ARE EVALUATING THE STUDENTS AND THEIR WORK? SO. I THINK THIS KEBAB POSSIBLY BE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT I CAN SHARE IS THAT NOT ONLY DO WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE INDICATORS THAT WERE USING WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO PREDICT SUCCESS IN ADMITTING STUDENTS. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO CONSIDER TRAINING DEVELOPMENT AS MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS -- PANEL OF THOSE WHO ARE REVIEWING OUR STUDENTS AND THOSE WHO SERVE AS GATEKEEPERS WE NEED TO ONGOING TRAINING ON IMPLICIT BIAS ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE ON DIVERSITY ONGOING TRAINING SO THAT WE ARE AWARE THAT WHAT WHAT WE REALLY HAVE FOUND OUT IS YOU CAN'T ELIMINATE BIAS BECAUSE WE'RE HUMAN. BUT WE CAN BECOME MORE AWARE OF THE BIAS THAT EXIST WHEN WE'RE LOOKING IT AT APPLICANTS ACROSS THE RANGE AND DISTRIBUTION AND SO IN AN EFFORT NOT TO COMPOUND THESE ISSUES IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT NOT TO USE THE TOOL. BUT TO EDUCATE OUR PANELS AND REVIEWERS. L. FAT FACULTY IN HIGHER ED TO BE MORE MINDFUL OF WHAT THE WORK IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO SO CREATING MORE ACCOUNTABILITY IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT WE ARE PLACING. THE BURDEN ON THOSE WHO ARE SERVING AS GATEKEEPERS TO BE MINDFUL BEYOND THE TOOLS THAT WE USE. AND I'LL STOP THERE [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] DINNER. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS WITH YOU THE BAR EXAMS CUT SCORE AND IT'S DISCRIMINATORY IMPACT. I'M I'M OFTEN ASKED TO SPEAK ABOUT DIVERSITY IN THE CONTEXT OF MY WORK ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON IMPLICIT RACIAL AND GENDER BIAS AND STEREOTYPE THREAD AND RACIAL ANXIETY -- AND I MENTION THAT BECAUSE ALL OF THE RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT DIVERSITY OF ALL TYPES OF RACIAL DIVERSITY AND GENDER DIVERSITY RESULTS IN MORE INNOVATION RESULTS IN MORE CREATIVITY. AND THAT IT CAN HELP PEOPLE AND SYSTEMS TO THRIVE AND THAT'S WHY DIVERSITY IS SO IMPORTANT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION ITSELF SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE. THE RESEARCH ALSO DEMONSTRATES THAT INDIVIDUALS THRIVE WHEN THEY HAVE A SENSE OF BELONGING WE'VE HEARD SOME OF THAT ALREADY THIS MORNING. AND WHEN THEY CAN SEE PEOPLE AROUND THEM WHO ARE LIKE THEM AND AS PEOPLE ON THAT FIRST PANEL STATED THIS MORNING THEY WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE WHERE THEY ARE. AND I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE THE D. IN OF A TOP TWENTY FIVE SCHOOL HI THERE -- MY MOTHER IS A KOREAN IMMIGRANTS MY FATHER IS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MEMBER OF THE ARMY AND LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE OF ALREADY SHARED THIS MORNING THROUGHOUT MY ENTIRE CHILDHOOD. IF IT WEREN'T FOR MY MOM WHO WORKED AT OF ROPE FACTORY -- IN THE NIGHT SHIFT THROUGHOUT MY ENTIRE HIGH SCHOOL CAREER AND IF IT WEREN'T FOR MY FATHER ALSO PROVIDING US WITH EVERY BELIEF IN THE FACT THAT MY BROTHERS AND I COULD MAKE IT AND COULD DO IT. AND IF IT WEREN'T OR ALL OF THE PEOPLE OF COLOR THE SUCCESSFUL OF PEOPLE OF COLOR. THAT SUPPORTED ME THROUGHOUT MY ENTIRE EDUCATION AND THEN IN LAW SCHOOL ALL THE WAY TO ENCOURAGING ME. TO BECOME THE DEAN OF THIS ONE I WOULD NOT BE HERE AND I KNOW THAT IT MAKES AN INCREDIBLE DIFFERENCE TO MY STUDENTS BECAUSE THEY TELL ME ALL THE TIME. AND TO MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE LAW PROFESSOR PROFESSION TO SEE THE TYPE OF DIVERSITY THAT EXIST AND TO HAVE THIS SENSE OF BELONGING SO IT IS. CRITICAL AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR FOR HAVING THIS HEARING TO REALLY EXAMINE. THESE ISSUES. AND SO IN LIGHT OF THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSITY TO THE LEGAL PROFESSION I JUST WANT TO BE BLUNT. IF WE CARE ABOUT DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND I WILL ASSUME THAT WE DO. THEN THE CURRENT TO BAR EXAM CUT SCORES IS SIMPLY UNCONSCIONABLE. WE HAVE THE SECOND HIGHEST CUT SCORE IN THE NATION ONLY DELAWARE IS HIGHER. NEW YORK'S CUT SCORE IS. ONE THIRTY THREE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE CUTS SCORE FOR PASSING THE BAR EXAM IS. ONE THIRTY FIVE CALIFORNIA'S CUT SCORE IS. ONE FORTY FOUR AND WE KNOW WITHOUT ANY DOUBT THAT ARE ABNORMALLY HIGH CUT SCORE HAS A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON PEOPLE OF COLOR. SO IF OUR CUTS GORE HAD BEEN ONE THIRTY FIVE WHICH I MENTIONED ALREADY IS THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. THEN 43% MORE WHITES WOULD HAVE PASSED THE BAR EXAM IN JULY. 64% MORE ASIANS WOULD HAVE PASSED THE BAR EXAM 68% MORE LATIN ACTS WOULD HAVE PASSED THE BAR EXAM AND ONE HUNDRED AND 23% MORE AFRICAN AMERICANS WOULD HAVE PASSED THE JULY BAR EXAM. IF OUR CUTS SCORE WHERE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF ONE THIRTY FIVE AND IF THESE INDIVIDUALS HAD TAKEN THE BAR IN NEW YORK OR IN MOST OTHER STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THEY WOULD BE PRACTICING LAW RIGHT NOW. INSTEAD BECAUSE OF OUR OUT LIAR CUT SCORE MANY OF OUR PROMISING AND TALENTED Là GRADUATES ARE LOSING THEIR JOBS. AND INCREASING THEIR DEBT. SO IT IS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT ARE ABNORMALLY HIGH CUT SCORE ADVERSELY IMPACTS THE DIVERSITY OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND IF WE WERE TO REDUCE THE CUT SCORE. AT LEAST TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE WE WOULD IMMEDIATELY ENSURE THAT THE LAWYERS ENTERING THE PROFESSION IN CALIFORNIA COME CLOSER TO REPRESENTING OUR POPULATION AND ALSO DIVERSITY OF STUDENTS WHO GRADUATE FROM OUR LAW SCHOOLS. SO WHAT THEN IS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR FAILING TO REDUCE OUR CUT SCORE. YOU WOULD IMAGINE THAT THE JUSTIFICATION WOULD BE A COMPELLING ONE GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW IS THE ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE DIVERSITY OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION BUT THE ONLY JUSTIFICATION. THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN FOR KEEPING OUR CUTS SCORE ABNORMALLY HIGH IS TRADITION. SO AGAIN TO BE BLUNT IT IS SHAMEFUL IN MY OPINION TO RETAIN A CUT SCORE BASED SOLELY ON TRADITION WHEN WE KNOW THAT A DRAMATICALLY LIMITS THE DIVERSITY OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION. IN CALIFORNIA. SO LET'S CONTINUE TO STUDY THE PROBLEM AS THE BAR SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD. BUT LET'S REDUCE THE CUT SCORE WHILE WE DO SO. BECAUSE THE DIVERSITY OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE SAY THAT WE CARE ABOUT. DEPENDS UPON IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH [inaudible] THANK YOU. JUSTICE LIEU. WELCOME THANK YOU -- THANK YOU CHAIRMAN STONE AND MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE COMMITTEE -- I'M VERY DELIGHTED. TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS IMPORTANT HEARING I'M GRATEFUL TO ALL OF YOU FOR HIGHLIGHTING THIS -- THIS ISSUE -- CHAIRMAN STONE LIKE MANY CALIFORNIANS I GREW UP. IN AN IMMIGRANT FAMILY IN FACT RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THIS IS MY HOMETOWN AND COMING BACK HERE TODAY. REMINDS ME OF THE VERY FIRST LAWYER I'VE EVER MET. HIS NAME WAS BOB MATSUI. AND HE WAS MY CONGRESSMAN AT A TIME WHEN. THE FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES INCLUDED JUST THREE ASIAN AMERICANS. WHEN I WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL BOB SPONSORED ME TO BE A PAGE IN THE? US CONGRESS BACK WHEN THERE WERE SUCH THINGS. AND FROM HIS MENTORSHIP AN EXAMPLE I CAME TO REALIZE THAT A PERSON LIKE ME COULD GROW UP TO BE A PERSON LIKE HIM. AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHY DIVERSITY MATTERS IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION -- I THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BOB MADE IN MY LIFE. I ALSO THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE THAT A MORE INCLUSIVE LEGAL PROFESSION MIGHT OF MADE IN BOB'S LIFE. YOU SEE IN NINETEEN FORTY TWO WHEN BOB WAS SIX MONTHS OLD. HE AND HIS FAMILY WERE FORCIBLY RELOCATED FROM THEIR HOME IN SACRAMENTO TO THE INTERNMENT CAMP. AT TO A LAKE. AND THIS STAIN ON OUR NATIONAL HISTORY HAS MANY CAUSES BUT IS WORTH ASKING I THINK. WHETHER COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF MORE PEOPLE LIKE BOB MATSUI HAD OCCUPIED THE TOP ECHELONS. OF GOVERNMENT AT THE TIME. AND THE FACT THAT BOB'S NAME NOW GRACES THE FEDERAL COURTHOUSE JUST THREE BLOCKS FROM HERE. IS A POIGNANT REMINDER OF THIS LEGACY. THE ISSUE OF DIVERSITY HAS ALWAYS BEEN DEEPLY PERSONAL TO ME AND NEVER MORE SO THAN NOW. WHEN I WAS APPOINTED TO THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IN? TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN I DO NOT FULLY APPRECIATE HOW UNCOMMON IT WAS. FOR AN ASIAN AMERICAN TO BE A JUDGE. AMONG NEARLY SEVENTEEN HUNDRED JUDGES IN CALIFORNIA LESS THAN WHEN ASIAN AMERICANS WERE OVER TODAY? NEARLY 8% OF CALIFORNIA JUDGES ARE ASIAN AMERICAN COMPARED 215% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION. LESS THAN 11% OF OUR JUDGES ARE LATINO. COMPARED 214% OF THE STATE POPULATION THESE NUMBERS. ACTUALLY REFLECTS SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS SINCE I JOIN THE BENCH. BUT THEY'RE STILL A LONG WAY TO GO. THE MOST LIKELY PATHWAYS TO THE BENCH REMAIN AN OBSTACLE COURSE FOR MANY GROUPS [inaudible] CONSIDER PROSECUTORS. A STUDY BY STANFORD LAW SCHOOL FOUND THAT AMONG CALIFORNIA PROSECUTORS IN SUPERVISORY POSITIONS IN. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ONLY 9% WERE ASIAN TEN POINT 8% WERE LATINO SIX POINT 6% WERE BLACK. OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE WERE WHITE. IN A STATE WAS POPULATION IS LESS THAN 40%. WHITE. CONSIDER LAW FIRMS YOU SAW SOME OF THE DATA EARLIER. A TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SURVEY OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MAJOR FIRMS BY VAULT IN THE MINORITY CORPORATE COUNSEL ASSOCIATION. REPORTED. THAT 92% OF EQUITY PARTNERS WERE WHITE AS WERE 89% OF NOT EQUITY PARTNERS. ATTRITION RATES AMONG ASIAN BLACK AND LATINO ASSOCIATES ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN THOSE AMONG WHITES. NOTABLY FORTUNATELY SOME OF THE FIRM'S DEMONSTRATING LEADERSHIP ON DIVERSITY ARE RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF YOUR NEXT PANELISTS HAILING CHEN WAS RECENTLY APPOINTED THE CO MANAGING PARTNER OF MUNGER TOLLES OLSEN. BUT WE NEED A LOT MORE HAILING CHANCE IN THE PIPELINE FOR ADVANCEMENT IN OUR PROFESSION. OR CONSIDER JUDICIAL CLERKSHIPS WHICH IS AN EARLY PRESTIGE MARKER AFTER LAW SCHOOL THE DATA FROM THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR LAW PLACEMENT SHOW. THAT ASIAN BLACKS LATINOS COMPRISED 14% OF FEDERAL LAW CLERKS IN. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN EVEN THOUGH THEY MADE UP 23% OF THE GRADUATES FROM THE TOP THIRTY LAW SCHOOLS. THIS DISPARITIES TROUBLING BECAUSE A JUDICIAL CLERKSHIP IS OFTEN EXPERIENCE THAT STIMULATES INTEREST IN BECOMING A JUDGE. IN A RECENT MEDIA INTERVIEW I WAS ASKED TO REFLECT ON MY OWN PATH TO THE BENCH. I SAID THAT MUCH OF MY PATH AROSE. FROM SHEER LUCK. LUCK THAT I FOUND CERTAIN MENTORS LOCK THAT SOME OF THOSE MENTORS INTERVENED AT CRUCIAL MOMENTS. AND OTHERS WERE WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE ON ME. AND I SAID FOR EVERYONE OF ME WHO HAS HAD GOOD FORTUNE THERE ARE OTHERS. WHO ARE TRYING TO NAVIGATE THEIR CAREERS ON THEIR OWN? OR FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS. YOU KNOW I'M REMINDED OF THE OLD ADAGE. THAT OPPORTUNITY IS WHERE LUCK MEETS PREPARATION. MUCH OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS TO REDUCE THE ELEMENT OF LOCK. SO THAT PREPARATION IS THE MAIN GATEWAY TO OPPORTUNITY. IN A TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN STUDY THAT I CO AUTHORED WITH SEVERAL YELLOW STUDENTS. WE SURVEYED OVER SIX HUNDRED ASIAN AMERICAN LAWYERS AND ASKED WHAT OBSTACLES TO ADVANCEMENT THEY EXPERIENCE. THE MOST COMMON ANSWER WAS INADEQUATE ACCESS TO MENTORS AND CONTACTS. IN MANY WORKPLACES ACCESS TO IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIPS IN NETWORKS. IS THE TOUGHEST NUT TO CRACK. BUT THIS CANNOT BE LEFT TO LUCK. IF WE WANT DIVERSITY AT THE TOP OF OUR PROFESSION. WE HAVE TO MAKE INCLUSION AND INTENTIONAL AND SYSTEMATIC PART OF WORKPLACE POLICIES AND REWARD STRUCTURES IT MUST BE BAKED INTO THE WAY WE DEVELOP TALENT. AND FACILITATE ADVANCEMENT. SO CLOSE I JUST WANT TO COMMEND THIS COMMITTEE FOR SHINING A SPOTLIGHT ON THIS ISSUE WE NEED TO DISCUSS IT WE NEED TO MONITOR IT. AND WE NEED TO KEEP MEASURING PROGRESS BECAUSE WHAT GETS MEASURED GETS MANAGED. TRANSPARENCY AND AWARENESS ARE THE PREREQUISITES FOR DEVELOPING SOLUTIONS AND MOTIVATING ACTION. SO MY HOPE IS THAT THIS HEARING WILL BE THE FIRST OF MANY PERHAPS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. THAT BRINGS SUSTAINED ATTENTION TO AN ISSUE THAT IS VITAL TO THE EFFICACY OUR PROFESSION. AND TO THE WELL BEING OF OUR SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND BE PLEASED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT. THANK YOU JUST AS A THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US. SEVERAL TIMES THIS NOTION OR THIS STATEMENT I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. AND AND THAT'S JUST FRUSTRATE TRUE AND I KNOW HOW WE GET THERE BUT HOW DO WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE [inaudible] THAT'S NOT. WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM PEOPLE ANYMORE AND THIS NOTION OF LOCK AND OPPORTUNITY? COMING TOGETHER OR LIKE IN PREPARATION COMING TOGETHER THAT CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY I THINK THAT'S GENERALLY TRUE BUT AS WE'VE HEARD. THERE ARE GATEKEEPERS ALONG THE WAY AND THEIR GATES ALONG THE WAY. THAT INORDINATELY THE INFLUENCE THAT. OPPORTUNITY THE REGARDLESS OF PREPARATION AND REGARDLESS OF LOCK THAT ESSENTIALLY TAKE LOCKED OUT OF THE EQUATION. IS WHAT IT SEEMS AND SO THAT THAT THAT THAT GATE IS IS ALLOWING SOME THROUGH IT AND NOT ALLOWING OTHERS THROUGH. REALLY BASED ON PREPARATION. SO I WAS I WAS GONNA ASK A LOADED QUESTION BUT I JUST CAN'T. BECAUSE IT'S ONE IT'S A QUESTION THAT COMES UP THAT THAT THAT MAKES ME CRAZY AND THAT'S THIS NOTION THAT IF WE DROP THE CUT SCORE. IF WE ADDRESS THE LSAT IF WE ADDRESS THE GRE. ART WE DUMBING DOWN [inaudible] THOSE EXAMS [inaudible] WHEN? WHICH IS FRUSTRATING VERY FRUSTRATING BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LACK OF OPPORTUNITY IN THE PIPELINE FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR BECAUSE OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. IT'S NOT A MATTER OF DUMBING DOWN IT'S A MATTER OF REMOVING AN UNNECESSARY BARRIERS. SO THAT WE CAN GET MORE QUALIFIED ATTORNEYS INTO THE PROFESSION. WELL FIRST OF ALL. STUDENTS AT THE LAW SCHOOL. THEN ATTORNEYS IN THE PROFESSION AND THEN. ATTORNEYS. REPRESENTING DIVERSITY ON TO THE BATCH SO HOW DO I KNOW YOU ADDRESS THAT BUT BUT HOW DO WE ADDRESS THAT ISSUE THAT KEEPS COMING UP ABOUT. DUMBING DOWN AN EXAM SO WHERE. IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE WERE ARTIFICIALLY THEN GIVING OPPORTUNITIES WERE UP TO OUR PLEASE DON'T DON'T. LIE AND I HATE ARTICULATED THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE HOW DO WE COMBAT THAT NOTION HOW DO WE MAKE IT VERY CLEAR. THAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS MAKE SURE. THAT WE GET THE BEST QUALIFIED PEOPLE INTO THE PROFESSION ON THE BENCH. WELL I THINK YOU CHAIR THAT YOU ASK THE QUESTION AND THEN YOU YOU ANSWERED IT. TOO BUT BUT I'LL JUST ADD. A FEW MORE POINTS AT THE TO THAT FIRST TO SAY THAT WE FIRST AND PRIMARILY THE BAR EXAM ITSELF WE KNOW HAS BEEN OPERATING AS A BEAR YEAR. TO ENTRY. MOST PEOPLE MOST STUDENTS PASS THAT BAR EXAM. IN THEIR SECOND OR THIRD TIME. AND SO WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NOT PASSING IT THE FIRST TIME IN PASSING AT THE SECOND OR THIRD TIME IT'S JUST GETTING BETTER AT MEMORIZATION. RIGHT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HOW COMPETENT YOU ARE AS A LAWYER AND LESS WHAT WE ARE SAYING. IS THAT MOST STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY INCLUDING NEW YORK THAT WE OFTEN COMPARE OURSELVES -- TO THAT NEW YORK HAS LAWYERS WHO ARE INCOMPETENT THERE ARE NO THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT AT ALL IN ARE WE SAYING THAT DELAWARE LAWYERS THEN ARE FAR BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA LAWYERS BECAUSE THEY ARE CUT SCORE. IS HIGHER. THERE HAS BEEN NO EVIDENCE AT ALL THAT THE CUT SCORE THAT WE HAVE ON OUR CURRENT BAR EXAM SAYS. ANYTHING. ABOUT THE INTELLECT OR THE COMPETENCE OF THE LAWYER'S HERE IT IS SIMPLY ACTING AS A BARRIER TO ENTRY. OTHERWISE HOW DO WE EXPLAIN THE STUDENTS TO PASS THEIR SECOND OR THIRD TIME HAVE THEY BECOME SMARTER. IN THOSE SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR OR TWO NO THEY HAVE JUST GOTTEN BETTER. AT MEMBERS ATION. SO I EIGHT CHALLENGE I THINK SOMEONE ELSE SAID BEFORE I THINK IT WAS -- ASSEMBLYMAN CHU WHO SAID THE BURDEN OF PROOF. RESTS ON THOSE WHO WOULD KEEP THE CURRENT CUT SCORE AND SO FAR I THINK THE ONLY EXPLANATION THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN IS THAT TRADITION IS WHY WE'VE KEPT THAT SCORE AND SO WE CARE ABOUT DIVERSITY. AND AND WHERE THE LOTS OF DIVERSE LAWYERS HERE AND BY THE WAY -- I CAME HERE FROM NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON STATE I TOOK BOTH OF THOSE BAR EXAMS AND THEN I TOOK CALIFORNIA BUT I DON'T THINK THAT I'M A SMARTER OR MORE COMPETENT LAWYER. BECAUSE I TOOK THE THREE DAY CALIFORNIA BAR EXAM THAN I WAS WHEN I TOOK THE WASHINGTON STATE AND THE NEW YORK BAR EXAM. IT IN FOR THE PROFESSION OR FOR THE EDUCATIONAL PROFESSORS HERE AS WELL INTERESTING THAT YOU'RE SEEING THAT SAME PHENOMENON IT IN THE GRE. AND PERCENT OF THE THE THE LSAT. SO IS THIS. WHAT DOES THAT SAY FOR HOW WE'VE USED? TESTING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF DECADES. I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT WE'VE HAD IN. WE'VE HAD AN ARTIFICIAL OVER RELIANCE ON A SCHOOL BOARD THAT WE HAVE PRESUMED IN PREVIOUS YEARS WAS PREDICTING SUCCESS ARE. I KNOW WITHIN HIGHER ED FACULTY SOMETIMES LOOK AT HIGHER JUROR YOU SCORES AND MISTAKENLY ASSUME THAT STUDENTS WHO SCORE HIGHER OR MORE EQUIPPED ARE BETTER QUALIFIED AND IT ISN'T THE CASE BECAUSE WE STARTED TO DO. DATA ANALYSIS TO SHOW THAT AND SO I THINK WHAT IT'S SAYING IS THAT WE HAVE INCORRECTLY USED A MEASUREMENT THAT WE THOUGHT WAS PREDICTING. BETTER -- PERFORMANCE THAT WASN'T AND I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TRIED TO SHARE WITH -- FACULTY AT LEAST AT UC DAVIS AND UCLA WHERE WE'RE DOING OUR PROJECT IS THAT. WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET ATIS EXCELLENCE? AND WE WANT QUALITY WHAT WE HAVE DONE HOWEVER IT IS USED TO TOLL. AND MADE IT MEAN EXCELLENT ANY QUIRK AND AND AND QUALITY BUT IT DOES NOT AND SO IT IS IMPORTANT IN ANY ENDEAVOR IF YOU'RE USING INDICATORS OR CRITERIA THAT YOU'RE ASSUMING LEADS TO A CERTAIN OUTCOME TO REEVALUATE. WHERE EDUCATORS THAT'S WHAT WE DO WE ASK QUESTIONS WE CHALLENGE AND WE REVISIT PREVIOUS ASSUMPTIONS AND CHALLENGE THOSE ASSUMPTIONS SO THAT WE CAN IMPROVE? BUT WE IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE I THINK WE GOT A LITTLE LAZY. AND AND AND AND RELUCTANT TO MOVE INTO AND EVEN WITHIN HIRE AT THE CUT OFF SCORES CLEARLY SHOW. THAT LARGE PORTIONS OF POPULATIONS ARE NOT EVEN. ABLE TO ENTER INTO THE THE COMPETING PROCESS FOR POSITIONS IN GRAD SCHOOL AND SO FORTH AND SO REALLY CHALLENGING THOSE INDICATORS AS NOT EVEN BEING ABLE TO PREDICT THE SUCCESS. BUT IT DOES REQUIRE ADDITIONAL WORK IT DOES REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TRAINING IT DOES REQUIRE THAT. THOSE WHO ARE GATEKEEPERS OUR REVIEWERS THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO PUT IN THE EFFORT TO REVIEW -- CRITERIA AND CHARACTERISTICS ABOUT THOSE WHO ARE ENTERING THE PROFESSION AND AND BEING A PART OF DISCUSSIONS LIKE THIS ONE TO SAY WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO MOVE FORWARD SO JUST. CHANGING THE THE CUT OFF SCORE IN THE ELSE THAT WON'T CHANGE SOME OF THE DATA THAT LANDON SHARED SO THERE'S ADDITIONAL WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE SO. MAKING SURE YOU'RE INVESTED AND MAKING SURE PEOPLE ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO MOVING FORWARD AND REALLY REFLECTING THE DIVERSE CITY THAT EXIST IN OUR POPULATION. WHEN I WAS I STARTED MY CLICK OCCUR ON THE SCHOOL BOARD AND THIS IS? LATE NINETIES EARLY TWO THOUSANDS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT. I LEARNED VERY QUICKLY THAT WAS FRUSTRATING. WHERE THE STANDARDIZED TESTING? AND WE KEPT ARTICULATING. POLICY SACRAMENTO AROUND MULTIPLE MEASURES FOR FOR TESTING KIDS AND IT JUST SEEMS. THAT THOSE STANDARDIZED TESTS WERE USED WHEN THEY WERE HIRED BY REALTORS TO SELL HOUSES BY SCHOOLS TO BE TO COLLECT EIGHTY A OR THE STATE TO PUNISH. LOW PERFORMING SCHOOL DISTRICTS BUT DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE INDIVIDUAL. ADVANCE BETTER CAPABILITY OF THE STUDENTS AND SO THIS THIS PROBLEM SEEMS TO GO ALL THE WAY BACK THERE TO HOW WE FUNDAMENTALLY USE. I THINK INCORRECTLY. THE STANDARDIZED TESTS AND WHAT THEIR FOR THEIR NOT. A BETTER SYSTEM I ALWAYS THOUGHT WOULD BE ONE THAT TRACKED THE STUDENTS PROGRESS THAT WAS USED BY THE TEACHER YEAR TO YEAR TO YEAR TO UNDERSTAND. CHALLENGE THAT THAT CHILD HAD WEAKNESSES IN THE EDUCATION SO THAT YOU COULD MORE TAYLOR THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. TO THAT OR THE EDUCATION EXPERIENCE TO THAT CHILD'S NEEDS AS OPPOSED TO JUST RATING A SCHOOL OR NOT. AND THAT SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF WHAT I'M HEARING. NOW AT THE GRADUATE LEVEL WITH THE HOURS A. T. OF THE GRE AND THAT CERTAINLY WE WE ARE VERY WHERE IN. MY HAND THAT I I ALSO INCLUDED THE IN CAT BECAUSE THEY ALSO BEEN ENTERED THIS ENDEAVOR AS WELL. OKAY SO WE HAVE WE'RE WE'RE JUST LOOK AT THE LEGAL PROFESSION BUT CLEARLY WE HAVE. A LOT OF WORK TO DO. FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT FOR CALIFORNIA AND HOW WE RATE. STUDENTS KIDS MOVING THROUGH THE SYSTEM BUT THEN WHO WERE WELCOMING INTO THE PROFESSIONAL RANKS I IMAGINE DIVERSITY IS A CHALLENGE IN ALL OF OUR PROFESSIONAL RIGHTS I THINK THAT. YES DIVERSITY HAS BEEN CHALLENGING AND I THINK IF WE ARE AIMING TO BE MORE EQUITABLE AND INCLUSIVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK ACROSS A RANGE OF FACTORS IN SO. IT AS WE'RE HAVING THESE DISCUSSIONS IDENTIFY WHAT THOSE RANGE OF FACTORS ARE THAT. LEAD US TO IDENTIFY CAPABLE AND STUDENTS WHO ARE ABLE TO PROCEED THROUGH THE PROCESS WHETHER IT BE GRADUATE SCHOOL. LAW SCHOOL MEDICAL SCHOOL BUT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO LOOK AT THESE FACTORS AND NOT -- BE LAZY. PROFESSOR CALENDAR BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT MORE THE EARLY PART OF THE PIPE YEAH BUT I WAS TO WEAR OUT THAT -- THESE TESTS -- THERE A LOT OF TIMES WE TAKE THEM AND ARE ON THEIR OWN BUT IN FACT AT LEAST UP YOU KNOW THROUGH COLLEGE WE KNOW THAT HIGH SCHOOL GPA CONTINUES TO BE. A BETTER PREDICTOR FOR MOST FOR ENTRANCE AND AND THAT THAT COLLEGE BOARD VALIDATES ITS TESTS ABOVE AND BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL GPA WHAT DOES IT OFFER AND OFFERS VERY LITTLE AND OFFER SOME WHICH IS WHY WE CONTINUE TO USE THAT. BUT OFFERS VERY LITTLE ABOVE AND BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL GPA AND WE KNOW THAT IT IS. WHEN WE SEE AGAIN AS EVER? AS I SAID IN MY REMARKS THAT LEADS -- TO OF THE TEST ITSELF IS NOT BIASED IT IS AT IT IS BOTH DEMONSTRATING. REVEALED -- EDUCATION EXPOSURE TO YOU KNOW REAL DIFFERENCES IN THE CLASSROOM BUT ALSO A HOST OF OTHER DISADVANTAGES AND ADVANTAGES THAT STUDENTS HAVE BEEN IN TAKING THESE TESTS. AS WE HEARD THIS MORNING EVERYTHING FROM AN ADDITIONAL PREP COURSE NETWORKS AT TEST TAKING STRATEGIES AND SO WHAT WE SHOULD JUST KEEP IN MIND AS AS YOU SAID MULTIPLE MEASURES ALLOW STUDENTS TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR ABILITIES TO DO THE WORK AND IN DIFFERENT WAYS SOME OF WHICH IS. REPRESENTED BY TESTS AND OTHERS. WELL I TAKES MY WORK IS REPRESENTED BY PRIOR ACADEMIC HISTORY BACKGROUND AND I THINK LAW SCHOOLS AND AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS ARE USING THAT MORE AND MORE BUT WE CONTINUE TO TAKE THE SHORT CUT UP. A TEST THAT CONTINUES TO SORT OF SHOW IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES BY SOCIAL BACKGROUND BY RACE ETHNICITY BUT BUT IT IN YOU SAID BUT THAT THE TEST ISN'T BIAS DOESN'T THAT MAKE THE TEST WELL THAT'S SEC WITH THAT THAT IS THAT IS THE ULTIMATE QUESTION RIGHT SO IT. AS LONG AS IT DEMONSTRATES I THINK WHAT WE FORGET IS THAT -- IT IF IT IS DEMONSTRATING THAT SORT OF DEEP INEQUITIES THAT FROM EARLY ON ALL THEN THE IN AN INHERENTLY DOES THE MEASURE. BECAUSE THE ACTUAL ITEM IS NOT BY IS WE'RE NOT ASKING STUDENTS TO REFLECT ON YACHTS ARE THINGS THAT THEY MAY NOT EXPERIENCE ANY MORE A SPORT THAT THEY'VE NEVER HEARD OF DEBT HAS REDUCED THE ITEM BIAS THAT WE SEE YES TESTS TODAY LOOK MUCH DIFFERENT THEY'RE MUCH MORE CHEESEMAN. ORIENTED OPTED TO THAN THAN THEY USED TO BE -- THESE THESE PARTICULAR THESE THESE THAT'S AS IT USED TO BE MUCH MORE OF AN IQ TEST THAN IT THAN AN ACHIEVEMENT TESTS. NEVER THE LESS IT IS STILL CAPTURING. BOTH REAL ACHIEVEMENT DIFFERENCES AND MANY THAT AS I SAID ARE. YOU KNOW CORRELATED WITH LOTS OF STRUCTURAL INEQUALITY THAT WE HAVE IN OUR SCHOOLING SYSTEM AND SO WE CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY FROM THE TEST SO. THE TEST IS -- YOU KNOW IT'S JUST ONE MARKER AS IS MANY MANY OTHER MARKERS IT'S JUST THAT WHEN WE CONTINUE TO USE THAT TO YOUR POINT ABOUT KATE TWELVE TESTING IN SCHOOL. I I BELIEVE WE DO NEED THOSE TEST BECAUSE THEY CONTINUE TO SHOW US THE SCHOOLS WHERE WE NEED TO INVEST MORE RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS. ARE IN FACT GETTING ACCESS TO GOOD CONTENT CURRICULUM THAT ALLOW THEM TO SO I NEW TESTS WHICH ARE MUCH MORE RIGOROUS THAN THEY USED TO BE OUR COMMON CORE. SMART BOUNCE TESTS ARE VERY MUCH REFLECTING CAN AGAIN THERE IT'S NOT JUST THE SAT THERE'S LESS RACIAL ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN. IN -- OUR STATE TEST AND THERE ARE AND ON COLLEGE ADMISSIONS TESTS BUT THEY STILL REFLECT A LONG WAY TO GO IN TERMS OF REDUCING TIME DIFFERENCES BY RACE AND SOCIOECONOMIC BACK TO DO BUT BUT ACCESS TO THE PREP COURSES. FOR THE WAY THAT A PARTICULAR SCHOOL IS IS ADDRESSING THOSE KIDS NEEDS GETTING THEM READY. TO TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM THAT TEST. AND THEN BUT WE SEEN SO MANY KIDS WHO ARE GOOD TEST TAKERS SO MANY KIDS WHO ARE NOT GOOD TEST TAKERS. JUSTICE MARK JUST AS CAPABLE. BUT ONE WILL PERFORM BETTER BECAUSE IN THAT ENVIRONMENT THEY'RE BETTER. AND THAT BUT THAT DOESN'T GIVE US THE RESULT. THAT WERE LOOKING FOR ULTIMATELY IF WE'RE GOING TO SAY. THIS IS GOING TO BE SOMEONE WHO WILL BE A IN AN ETHICAL UPSTANDING HIGH QUALITY ATTORNEY WHICH IS BACK TO THE QUESTION THAT WOULD THAT WE'RE ASKING HERE. WE ALSO HAVE HIS BILL LOTS OF SOCIAL SCIENCE EVIDENCE I THINK BUT THAT AT THAT -- YOU KNOW STEREOTYPE THREAT OTHER THAT PERFORMANCE ON THE TASK AT THE HIGH STAKES YEAH -- IS AGAIN -- IMPACTS AND GROUPS WHO ARE UNDERREPRESENTED IN IN PERFECT IN CERTAIN PROFESSIONS OUR IN IN -- HIGH STAKES -- SITUATIONS WOMEN AND MATH TESTS -- UNREPRESENTED -- MINORITIES IN A HIGH STAKES TESTS VERSES A LOS AT LOWER STAKES TESTS ON UNDER PERFORM FROM MY OWN RESEARCH WE SAW THAT EVEN ON THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL EXIT EXAM. THAT SIMILARLY PERFORMING STUDENTS WHEN THE TEST WITH A HIGH STAKES TEST WE SOUGHT SIMILARLY ABLE STUDENTS UNDER PERFORMING PARTICULARLY UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITY GROUPS AND DIVERSITY IS CONNECTED TO THAT. PHENOMENON OF STEREOTYPE THREAT NO. OKAY OF I THINK WE NEED TO MOVE ON THE NEXT PANEL JUST IN IN IN ORDER OF TIME BUT WE SEE INTO YOUR POINTS HAS THE FLU. THIS IS A MUCH LONGER CONVERSATION AND THERE'S A LOT MORE. INFORMATION WE'RE GONNA NEED TO GATHER AND FACE. AND BE WILLING TO FACE AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COMES THROUGH AND JUSTICE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE WERE REALLY OUGHT TO THE USE OF THE TIME. TO COME AND JOIN US AND I THINK WE'VE GOT IT IF YOU JUST THERE'S A LOOK THROUGH THE LIST OF PEOPLE AND AND THE FOLKS WHO ARE COMING. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE SET OF PANELS AND INDIVIDUALS HERE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PRESENTING AND I WILL. CHALLENGE YOU ALL AS WELL AS OTHER PANELISTS KEEP US ACCOUNTABLE KEEP US ASKING THE QUESTIONS AND WORKING ON THESE FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE IN FACT. LISTENING LEARNING. AND MAKING PROGRESS SO ANY OTHER IDEAS YOU HAVE AS YOU CONTINUE ON THE WORK THAT YOU ARE WERE VERY VERY OPEN TO THAT. THANK YOU. RIGHT TO OUR THIRD PANEL. EXISTING EFFORTS TO INCREASE DIVERSITY WHAT MORE CAN BE DONE. WE HAVE CHRISTOPHER. PUT ON BY AN AND I'M SORRY IF I DON'T DO YOUR NAME VERY WELL THERE. WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF CHANGE LAWYERS? HAILING CHAD PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED TRUSTEES STATE BAR OF CALIFORNIA MITCH WINICK. DEAN OF THE MODERATE COLLEGE OF LAW. JUDGE FUJI FROM LOS ANGELES WHO'S THE THE FROM THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT. AND THEN JUDGE BRAZIL. JUDICIAL COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROVIDING ACCESS AND FAIRNESS. SO PLEASE COME FORWARD AND WE WILL GO THROUGH IN THAT ORDER. MR PEROT BY AT YET EVEN CLOSE YES VERY GOOD OKAY YEAH I KNOW BY PRESSING THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAMPION STONE AND MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS CHRIS PUT ON BUYING AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA CHANGE LAWYERS OUR MISSION IS TO BUILD A BETTER JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE BELIEVE THAT LAWYERS ARE CHANGE MAKERS AND WE EXISTS TO HARNESS THE POWER OF LAWYERS FOR JUSTICE IN TO INVEST IN THE NEXT GENERATION. OF LEADERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE OF INCREASING DIVERSITY IN THE PROFESSION. ALBERT EINSTEIN ONCE FAMOUSLY SAID WE CANNOT SOLVE PROBLEMS WITH THE SAME THINKING WE USED WHEN WE CREATED THEM. I LIKE THIS QUOTE BECAUSE IT INVITES US TO APPROACH INTRACTABLE PROBLEMS WITHIN ENTIRELY FRESH MINDSET. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO RE FRAME THE ISSUES BEFORE US TODAY BECAUSE WHAT'S AT STAKE IS MORE THAN JUST A LACK OF REPRESENTATION. IT'S THE CURRENT INABILITY OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM TO SERVE ALL INDIVIDUALS IN THE SAME MANNER. IN WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF FAIRNESS. IN OUR COUNTRY TODAY THERE IS A GROWING LACK OF TRUST IN OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. IN MANY WAYS THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN THE CASE FOR CAP FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND YES EVEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE CONTEXT THERE'S A DEEP LACK OF CONFIDENCE THAT THE SYSTEM WILL TREAT ALL DEFENDANTS FAIRLY. THIS IS COMPOUNDED BY THE FACT THAT NATIONALLY 95% OF PROSECUTORS ARE WHITE. AND OVERALL 67% OF OUR CALIFORNIA JUDGES ARE WHITE. VIEW THESE FACTS IN LIGHT OF THE REALITY THAT 75% OF INCARCERATED MEN IN CALIFORNIA ARE MEN OF COLOR. THE FACT THAT BLACK BROWN AND BLACK CALIFORNIANS ARE OVER PUNISHED IS NOT COINCIDENTAL. THIS LACK OF EQUAL JUSTICE WILL NOT BE REMEDIED SOLELY BY INCREASING DIVERSITY IN THE PROFESSION. BUT IT IS UNDENIABLE THAT INCREASING DIVERSITY EQUITY INCLUSION IN THE LAW IS A POWERFUL PLACE TO START. AS HAS ALREADY BEEN TESTIFIED TODAY PEOPLE OF COLOR WOMEN IN OTHER DIVERSE CALIFORNIANS DO NOT FEEL A SENSE OF BELONGING IN THE LAW. IT'S THAT FEELING WHEN YOU WALK INTO A ROOM AND YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON OF YOUR RACE GENDER IDENTITY OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NOT ON THE SAME PLAYING FIELD. YOU CAN'T LIVE UP TO YOUR FULL POTENTIAL AS A LAWYER. OR FRANKLY AS A HUMAN BEING. BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MORE THAN JUST THE FEELING. THIS LACK OF BELONGING IT'S BACKED BY HARD STATISTICS ABOUT THE BARRIERS FACING PEOPLE OF COLOR ENTERING THE PROFESSION STAYING IN THE PRACTICE. AND DESCENDING TO POSITIONS OF INFLUENCE. THE REALITY IS THAT DIVERSITY ATTORNEYS ARE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO RISE TO POSITION POWERFUL POSITIONS IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM. SUCH AS JUDGES FIRM PARTNERS OR NON PROFIT EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS. THOSE WHO DO SO UP OVERCOME TREMENDOUS ODDS BUT THE NUMBERS ARE STILL FAR TOO LOW GIVEN THIS DAY AND AGE AND THE PACE OF PROGRESS IS FAR TOO SLOW. YESTERDAY I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE A GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM SPEAK AT AN EVENT FOR ASIAN AMERICAN HISTORY MOUNTAIN HE SAID. YOU CAN'T BE WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE. SO WHAT CAN BE DONE. CALIFORNIA CHANGE LAWYERS AS ONE OF JUST A HANDFUL OF STATEWIDE ORGANIZATIONS COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING THE PROBLEMS STEMMING FROM A LACK OF DIVERSITY EQUITY INCLUSION IN THE LAW. WE EMPOWER A NEW GENERATION OF CHANGE MAKERS. WE HAVE CREATED A COMMUNITY WHERE FIRST GENERATION LOS STUDENTS AND LAWYERS FIND A SENSE OF BELONGING. WHERE THEY KNOW WE ARE COMMITTED TO THEIR SUCCESS? WE KNOW THAT THEY CAN BECOME THE NEXT SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. THE NEXT ATTORNEY GENERAL OR THE NEXT SENATOR. TO LAUNCH THE CAREERS WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS WE PROVIDE GRANTS TO NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WORKING AT THE HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE LEVEL. TO INCREASE EXPOSURE FOR UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES TO THE PROFESSION. WE PROVIDE SCHOLARSHIPS TO HELP DEFRAY THE STAGGERING COST OF LAW SCHOOL AND SCHOLARSHIPS TO THREE ELVES WHO ARE TAKING THE BARK TO PAY FOR PARKS FENCES. WE PROVIDE PUBLIC INTEREST FELLOWSHIPS TO PAY FOR SUMMER YA SUMMER LONG OR YEAR LONG JOBS IN LEGAL AID. WE PROVIDE TRAININGS ON IMPOSTER SYNDROME AND BAR PASSAGE ONGOING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND ACCESS TO MENTORS AND NETWORKS. AND WE'RE ALSO BEGINNING TO DEVELOP PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON INCREASING ACCESS TO PRESTIGIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL LAW CLERKSHIPS. ON A PERSONAL NOTE I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT WHEN I WAS A LAW STUDENT. OF MANY YEARS AGO I RECEIVED A SCHOLARSHIP FROM CALIFORNIA CHANGE LAWYERS. AND INVALIDATED IN ME THE BELIEF THAT I COULD BECOME A LEADER IN THE COMMUNITY. AND I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT I'VE MADE IT AND I'M PAYING IT FORWARD -- FOR FUTURE SCHOLARS AND LEADERS FOR OUR STATE. IN SPITE OF OUR SUPPORT THERE IS ONE ISSUE THAT'S ALREADY BEEN RAISED AND THAT OUR SCHOLARS TELL US IS A MAJOR CONCERN FOR THEM WHICH IS. THE RACIAL DISPARITY IN THE RATES OF BAR PASSAGE. IMAGINE YOU'RE THE FIRST IN YOUR FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE AND THEN CONTINUE ON TO LAW SCHOOL. YOU HAVE AMASSED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN EDUCATIONAL DAT. YOU HAVE FACED EXCLUSION LAW SCHOOL BECAUSE OF YOUR IDENTITY BUT YOU HAVE NONETHELESS GRADUATED AND NOW THE ONE THING STANDING BETWEEN YOU AND PRACTICING LAW IS THE BAR EXAM. THE PRESSURE TO SUCCEED IS SIMPLY ENORMOUS. WHILE BAR PASSAGE RATES ARE HISTORICALLY LOW FOR ALL EXAM TAKERS THE REALITY IS THAT IF YOU ARE BLACK OR BROWN. YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO FAIL THE EXAM THEN IF YOUR WHITE. THIS HAS TO CHANGE PARTICULARLY SINCE PAST EFFORTS TO REMEDIATE THE ISSUE. IN ANY SIGNIFICANT MATTER HAVE NOT BEEN FRUITFUL. A CHANGE LAWYERS WE BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO ARE CLOSEST TO THE PROBLEM ARE ALSO THE ONES CLOSEST TO THE SOLUTION. WHETHER ON THE ISSUE OF BAR PASSAGE CAREER PATHWAYS OR IN ACHIEVING EQUAL JUSTICE. OUR LEGAL COMMUNITY WILL NEVER MOVE FORWARD ON THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES IF WE DO NOT CREATE MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITIES FOR LAWYERS OF COLOR. LGBT LAWYERS WOMEN LAWYERS LAWYERS WITH DISABILITIES TO BE HEARD AND HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE THE STATUS QUO. IN ORDER TO RADICALLY XCELERATED PACE OF CHANGE WE NEED TO HAVE LAWYERS WHO LOOK LIKE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. IN THE SEATS OF POWER IN ALL OUR LEGAL INSTITUTIONS. WE IN CALIFORNIA ARE SHINING BEACON ON SO MANY ISSUES FOR OUR COUNTRY. WE STAND FOR THE PROMISE THAT YES A MULTI RACIAL DEMOCRACY WITH LEGAL INSTITUTIONS THAT SERVE ALL CALIFORNIANS WITH DIGNITY. IT'S POSSIBLE. WE ARE INVITED BY OUR VERY OWN US CONSTITUTION TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION. AND YET WE HAVE STILL NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE CORE ISSUES THAT PREVENT LAWYERS FROM ALL OUR COMMUNITIES. FROM REALIZING THEIR FULL POTENTIAL IN THE WORKPLACE AND% FOR SOCIETY. THE TIME IS NOW FOR US TO RETHINK OUR APPROACH. REBUILD TRUST IN OUR LEGAL INSTITUTIONS AN INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS THAT WILL CREATE LASTING CHANGE THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER BUCKET MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY -- MY NAME IS HELEN CHEN AS JUSTICE WE WILL LEAD TO EARLIER -- I AM THE CO MANAGING PARTNER OF MUNGER TOLLES OLSON. A LAW FIRM BASED IN LOS ANGELES WITH OFFICES IN SAN FRANCISCO AND DC AS WELL -- DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IS VERY PERSONAL TO ME. I AM A FIRST GENERATION AMERICAN. THE CHILD OF IMMIGRANTS WHO CAME HERE SHORTLY AFTER THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT WAS REPEALED. I AM THE FIRST PERSON IN MY FAMILY TO BE A LAWYER. WHEN I STARTED AT THE LAW FIRM I WAS A SINGLE MOTHER OF TWO CHILDREN? I AM NOW ONE OF THE FEW WOMEN LITIGATION PARTNERS IN MY FIRM OUR NUMBERS ARE INCREASING BUT WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. AND IN LOS ANGELES I AM THE ONLY WOMAN LITIGATION PARTNER WHO IS NOT WHITE. I AM A MEMBER OF THE STATE BAR BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO SHARE SOME THE EXCITING WORK THAT WE'VE DONE IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AS PART OF OUR NEW MANDATE -- AS PART OF THE CHANGE THAT WAS SHEPHERDED THROUGH BY THIS LEGISLATURE -- TO RE FRAME OUR MISSION AND WE ARE THE LARGEST A BAR IN THE COUNTRY. AND WE HAVE NOT UNTIL LAST YEAR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT WE GET TO TOUCH. EVERY SINGLE ATTORNEY EVERY YEAR AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR RIGHT WHEN WE ASK THEM TO PAY THEIR FEES. WE GET THAT ONE TOUCH I'M AND IS MISTER LEVER ON THE FIRST PANEL NOTED WE HAVEN'T COLLECTED DATA UNTIL NOW BUT WE STARTED DOING SO IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE LAUNCHED THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE DATA COLLECTION EFFORT. A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND ATTORNEYS RESPONDED. AND THIS IS OUR FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO YOU THE RESULTS OF THAT REVISED STATE AT I'M. I'M EXCITED IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE THIS ALLOWS US TO MOVE FORWARD WITH DATA INFORM STRATEGIES. UP UNTIL NOW MOST OF OUR WORK HAS BEEN BASED ON ANECDOTE WHAT ARE PEOPLE SAYING IN THE PROFESSION. BUT NOW WE HAVE CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC DATA. ADAM AND IF YOU I THINK WITH PASSED OUT COPIES OF OUR FLIGHTS. IF YOU TURN TO THE AM FIRST SLIDE AFTER THE COVER. THIS REALLY SHOWS IN A NUTSHELL THE RESULT OF HIS DATA COLLECTION. AND HOW ARE ATTORNEY POPULATION LOOKS. IN COMPARISON TO THE POPULATION AT LARGE. ATTORNEYS IN CALIFORNIA ARE MUCH LESS DIVERSE THAN THE STATE AS A WHOLE AND IN PARTICULAR LATINOS ARE PARTICULARLY UNDER REPRESENTED. IF YOU SEE THAT WHILE THE STATE POPULATION OF 35% LATINO ONLY 6% OF ATTORNEYS. ARE LATINA. HE TURNED TO THE NEXT SLIDE. THE SAME A SIMILAR DISPROPORTION. YOU SEE AMONGST WOMEN AND MEN SO EVEN THOUGH WOMEN MAKE UP ABOUT ONLY 42% OF THE ATTORNEY POPULATION. WE ALSO COLLECTED DATA ON ATTORNEYS A DISABILITIES AND LGBT ATTORNEYS. OF THE ATTORNEYS WHO REPORTED FOUR POINT 8% REPORTED DISABILITY. AN EIGHT POINT FOUR REPORTED AS LGBTQ. SO THE BOARD REALLY LOOK AT WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE STATE BAR WITH RESPECT TO DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION. AND IF YOU TURN TO THE NEXT SLIDE YOU'LL SEE THAT HISTORICALLY THE STATE BAR PARTICULARLY THROUGH THE WORK OF THE COUNCIL ON ACCESS. AND FAIRNESS. LOOKED AT MADE PIPELINE AND JUDICIAL DIVERSITY ACTIVITIES. WITH THIS NEW STATUTORY MISSION OF THE STATE BAR THE BOARD TOOK A NEW LOOK AT ITS DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION EFFORTS. AND IT HELD A DIVERSITY SUMMIT. IN AUGUST OF LAST YEAR AND IT WAS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND REALLY CONVENING A STATEWIDE SUMMIT OF AFFINITY BAR GROUPS LOCAL BARS. AND WE ASK THEM WHICH OF THE STATE BAR BE DOING. THE RESULT OF THAT SUMMIT INFORMED OUR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BOARD STRATEGIC PLANNING SESSION. AND COMING OUT OF THAT THE MOST COMMON REFRAIN WE HEARD WAYS WE NEED DATA. WE CAN'T MEASURE HOW WE'RE DOING UNLESS WE HAVE DATA. IF YOU TURN TO THE NEXT SLIDE. FLIGHT FOUR YOU'LL SEE THAT THE ROLE OF THE STATE BAR WITH RESPECT TO DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IS ENSHRINED IN ONE OF OUR GOALS. IN THE STRATEGIC PLAN SO THERE'S A FIVE PART FIVE YEAR STRATEGIC PLAN. GOAL NUMBER FOUR ENSHRINES OUR COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION AND IT REALLY ALIGNS WITH THEIR NEW STATUTORY MISSION AND THIS IS REALLY THE FIRST PART THAT GOES TO A QUESTION THAT MISTER TO ASK EARLIER. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THE STATE BAR IS FOCUSED ON DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION? IF THE PRESIDENT WHEN THE PRESIDENT LEAVES WHEN THERE'S A NEW PRESIDENT WHO MAYBE NOT AS FOCUSED ON PERCEIVED TO BE AS FOCUSED. ON DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION WELL WE'VE INSTITUTIONALIZED IT WE'VE PUT IT INTO OUR FIVE YEAR STRATEGIC PLAN AND WE NOW HAVE TO REPORT. TO THIS COMMITTEE EVERY TWO YEARS ON OUR PROGRESS TO THE SCHOOL. THE BOARD ESTABLISHED PARAMETERS FOR WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT WITH RESPECT TO DIVERSITY INCLUSION AND IT WANTED TO FOCUS ON THREE AREAS IN PARTICULAR ONE IS ENTRY INTO THE PROFESSION WHICH WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT. SO BOTH WRISTS WITH RESPECT TO HOW ARE FEW PEOPLE DOING IN LAW SCHOOL. AND HOW ARE PEOPLE DOING THE BAR EXAM. SECOND THEY WANTED TO FOCUS ON CAREER ADVANCEMENT. LAKE AT YOU JUST HEARD YOU CAN'T BE IT IF YOU DON'T SEE IT AND IT REALLY MATTERS IF THEY'RE PEOPLE IN POSITIONS OF LEADERSHIP PEOPLE THE JUDICIARY WHO REFLECT THE OVERALL POPULATION. AND THE THIRD AREA WE WANTED TO LOOK AT IS RETENTION BECAUSE AS WE'VE HEARD. OVER AND OVER AGAIN PEOPLE OF COLOR LGBT AND DISABLED LAWYERS ARE LEAVING THE PROFESSION IN DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBERS. WITH RESPECT TO GOAL NUMBER FOUR THE BAR HAS ALSO SET FORTH PARTICULAR OBJECTIVES OR ACTION ITEMS. AND SO YOU'LL SEE ON THE NEXT SLIDE A LIST OF THE ACTION ITEMS. FOR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AS WELL AS FOR SOME THAT WILL BE COMPLETED IN. TWENTY TWENTY AND IT'S PART OF OUR TWENTY TWENTY PLANNING SESSION WE'RE GOING TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL INITIATIVES FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHICH WILL TAKE US THROUGH THE FULL. FIVE YEAR CYCLE. SO I WANTED TO START OFF BY LOOKING AT SOME OF OUR DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION EFFORTS WITH RESPECT TO ENTRY INTO THE PROFESSION. THE STATE BAR'S COUNCIL AXES IN FAIRNESS COMMITTEE WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN. TWO THOUSAND SIX AM IF YOU LOOK AT FLIGHT. EIGHT ESTABLISH A TWO PLUS TWO PLUS THREE PROGRAM WHICH BEGINS WITH HIGH SCHOOL LIFE CATANESE. HELPING TO PUSH PEOPLE IN TO THE PIPELINE. BUT WE LACK DATA. AND SO. THE BAR HAS REALLY FOCUSED ON NOW LOOKING AT TWO AREAS LAW SCHOOL ATTRITION AND BAR PASSAGE. THOSE ARE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE MEASURABLE DATA AND CAN MEASURE RESULTS AND SUCCESS. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT SLIDE TEN WE LOOKED AT LAW SCHOOL ATTRITION AND THE NUMBERS THAT WE FOUND ARE STARTLING. THIS AFFECTS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO ARE ACTUALLY EVEN TAKING THE BAR EXAM IN THE FIRST PLACE. WHICH YOU KNOW IN ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER STUDENTS HAVE NEARLY DOUBLE THE DROP OUT RATE OF WHITE STUDENTS. BLACK LAW STUDENTS ARE DROPPING OUT IT NEARLY QUADRUPLED THE RATE OF WHITE STUDENTS. M. WELL I'M GONNA HAVE TO RUSH THROUGH THE FIGHT. AND WITH RESPECT TO CURRENT EXAM TAKERS WE IMPLEMENTED A WHICH IS NOW CALLED THE POSITIVE STRATEGIES AND STORIES PROGRAM AND DID IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN A CONTROLLED STUDY. THE RESULTS OF WHICH ARE VERY EXCITING -- I DID READ THE MATERIALS THAT WERE FROM THAT THAT COMMITTEE STAFF PREPARED AND ONE THING I WILL NOTE IS THAT. EVEN THOUGH THIS 18% IMPROVEMENT LIFTED ALL BOTH NOT JUST THE RESULT OF PEOPLE OF COLOR WE MAINTAIN THAT THAT IS KEY TO DIVERSITY INCLUSION THE SAME REASON. THAT YOU'VE HEARD BEFORE WHY FOLKS BELIEVE THAT LOWERING THE CUT SCORE WILL HELP PEOPLE OF COLOR IMPROVING BAR PASSAGE RATES FOR EVERYONE. ALSO INCREASES THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OF COLOR ENTERING THE PROFESSION. SO YOU FEE FROM THE REST OF THE SLIDES THAT WE'VE GATHERED ROBUST DATA ABOUT DEMOGRAPHICS. ABOUT PEOPLE'S CAREER ADVANCEMENT HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE MAKING IT TO PARTNERSHIP IN LAW FIRMS WE'RE ALSO LEARNING THAT MOST LAWYERS IN CALIFORNIA OVER SECTOR. SO WE TOOK A DEEP DIVE INTO THE PRIVATE SECTOR YOU'LL SEE THAT REFLECTED IN THESE LIVES HERE. WE ALSO GATHERED INFORMATION ABOUT CAREER SATISFACTION BECAUSE THAT REFLECTS RISK RETENTION IN THE PROFESSION. M. AND SO I'LL LET YOU GUYS GO THROUGH THE SLIDES ON YOUR OWN THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF DATA TO GO THROUGH. THEM. BUT TWO MORE THINGS I WILL AND WAY. WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT OTHER EXIT FROM THE PROFESSION -- WE'RE LOOKING TO PARTNER WITH THAT WE'RE PARTNERING WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ON A JUDICIAL DIVERSITY TOOL KIT. AND DOING REGIONAL AT REACH AND LOCAL TRAINING EVENTS WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT DISPARITIES IN DISCIPLINARY OUTCOME. SO. IT'S A FIRST OF ITS KIND STUDY ON RACE AND GENDER DISPARITY IN THE BARS ATTORNEY DISCIPLINE SYSTEM AND ITS BIAS AFFECTING THE RATE AT WHICH ATTORNEYS OF COLOR AND WOMEN ARE DISCIPLINED. AB AND I'LL JUST CONCLUDE WITH YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY EXCITING TO HAVE THIS DATA IT ALLOWS US TO TRANSITION AWAY FROM SIMPLY ANECDOTAL. EVIDENCE TO REALLY WORKING ON DATA DRIVEN DATA INFORM STRATEGIES -- ARE WE RECENTLY MET WITH THE CALIFORNIA LAWYERS ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS WITH THE CORPORATE MINORITY COUNSEL PROGRAM TO GO OVER THIS DATA. AND TO DISCUSS ADDITIONAL ANALYSES THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL. I'M WE'RE GONNA PLAN ADDITIONAL OUTREACH TO THE LOCAL AN AFFINITY BARS. I'M AND THE INITIAL FEEDBACK FORGETTING IS THAT THIS IS REALLY USEFUL DATA TO HELP TAYLOR DIVERSITY INCLUSION EFFORTS TO WHERE IT'S REALLY NEEDED. THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU. THE WINNING WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FIRST WELL THANK YOU FOR HAVING THE DISCUSSION TODAY. AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE THIS IS ONE THE MOST CRITICAL THINGS I THINK FACE OUR PROFESSION RIGHT NOW AND THANK YOU DEAR VERY CAPABLE STAFF. WHO I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS ON ISSUES LIKE THIS AND THIS REALLY HELPS US BRING? UP PAPERS LESS AS THE ONE THEY'VE PREPARED -- TO THE PUBLIC. I'M VERY HUMBLED WHEN I LISTEN TO THE STORIES OF THOSE WHO'VE WHO'VE BEEN HERE TODAY AND AND I CERTAIN AT LIKE YOU. AND WONDER WHAT ROLE DO I PLAY WHAT WHAT VOICE TO I HAVE HERE. AND SOMETIMES I WONDER WHY I CARE. BECAUSE BECAUSE I TO A STUDENT PRIVILEGE. OF MY PARENTS WERE COLLEGE EDUCATED. UP AS MANY. IMMIGRANT FAMILY CAME AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY BUT NOT WITH -- CHALLENGES AND AND STRUGGLES THAT WE SEE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND PARTICULARLY IN THE COUNTIES THAT I REPRESENT THE WORLD COUNTIES OF CAT. OF CALIFORNIA WITH MODERATE COLLEGE LAW AND SAN LUIS OBISPO COLLEGE LAW AND KERN COUNTY COLLEGE OF LAW. IT SHOWS I WAS THINKING I WAS LISTENING TODAY OR WHICH PART OF MY BACKGROUND RESONATED. SO MUCH WITH THESE THESE ISSUES AND WHY I THINK IT'S SO CRITICAL NOT JUST AS AN ACADEMIC. I AM NOT AS I WAS LISTENING I THOUGHT. YOU KNOW IT IS INTERESTING WHEN YOU'RE OLD LIKE I AM. AS SIXTY FOUR I THINK BACK GROWING UP IN TEXAS. AND WHEN I STARTED PRIMARY SCHOOL. WE HAD SEPARATE SCHOOLS FOR THE WHITES AND NON WHITES. IT'S IT'S WITHIN MY LIFETIME. IT WASN'T INCLUSION AND ACCESS IT WAS SEPARATE BUT EQUAL AND THAT'S WHAT THE SUPREME COURT PRIOR TO THAT TIME SAID WAS PERFECTLY FINE. IT WASN'T UNTIL I WAS IN FIFTH GRADE THAT THE INTEGRATED THE SCHOOLS IN TEXAS. SO I LIVED THROUGH THAT PROCESS OF SEEING WHERE SOMETHING THAT WE THOUGHT IN THE PAST WAS PERFECTLY OKAY. WASN'T EVEN CLOSE TO BEING OKAY AND HAD HUGE COSTS TO THE QUALITY OF OF OUR SOCIETY IN THE QUALITY OF OUR OF OUR EDUCATION AND OURS. AND OUR COMMUNITIES. I THINK WORD OF SIMILAR WATERSHED MOMENT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY OF THE PROFESSION. DEAN RICHARDSON SAID IT FAR MORE ARTICULATELY THAN I COULD AND VERY DIRECTLY SO. THERE'S NOT A LOT I NEED TO REPEAT ON THE ISSUE OF THE CUT SCORE. BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THE FOURTEEN FORTY CUTS COURT IS AN ARTIFACT. NOT UNLIKE SEPARATE BUT EQUAL WAS AN ARTIFACT. IT'S IT WAS SET UP FIFTY SIXTY SEVENTY YEARS AGO WE KNOW WHAT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE BAR WAS THEN. IT WAS SET UP TO MEASURE A GROUP THEN THAT IS NOT THE COMMUNITIES WE REFLECT NOW. AS SHE SAID IT IS TIME FOR US TO TAKE A VERY. CAREFUL LOOK AT THAT ARTIFACT. SO THE QUESTION WE MUST HAVE AS WELL ON WHAT BASIS COULD YOU MAKE THAT CHANGE. WELL THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION REALLY HELPS US ON THIS IT SAYS THAT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE. PRE EMPLOYMENT TESTING OR LICENSING. THAT HAS A DISPARATE IMPACT BASED ON RACE GENDER AGE. PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD IT'S FAIRLY EASY TO UNDERSTAND THAT. I THINK IF WE USE THAT MEASURE THAT THE CONSTITUTION GIVES US. AND WE APPLY IT TO THE INFORMATION WE'VE HEARD HERE TODAY. IT'S FAIRLY CLEAR THAT THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS SHOWS. THAT SCORE FOURTEEN FORTY AN ARTIFACT OF FIFTY OR SIXTY YEARS AGO HAS A DISPARATE IMPACT ON THE BASIS OF RACE AND ETHNICITY. IS REALLY. NO QUESTION ABOUT WHAT THE STATISTICS SHOW. BUT WE'RE LEFT WITH WELL WHAT WE DO NEXT IF THAT'S TRUE WHAT SHOULD WE DO. AND IN RICHARDSON ALSO POINTED OUT I THINK A VERY SIMPLE FACT THAT THE THE LAW AND THE CASE LAW SAYS THERE ARE TO BE PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS ARE STANDARDS BASED. ON THE JOB PERFORMANCE THAT WE SHOULD LOOK [inaudible] TO FORTY EIGHT OF THE OTHER JURISDICTIONS. HAVE SAID THAT SOMETHING BELOW FOURTEEN FORTY AND IN FACT. A MINIMUM PASSING SCORE OF THE BAR EXAM SHOULD BE BETWEEN THIRTEEN THIRTY IN. THIRTEEN EIGHTY FORTY EIGHT OF THE OTHER JURISDICTIONS. I THINK THAT PROVIDES US A PROFESSIONAL STANDARD AND NATIONAL MEANS THAT WHEN YOU AS A LEGISLATOR WHEN THE COURT. AS THE DECIDER OF THIS ISSUE LOOK TO WHERE CAN WE GET DIRECTION ON WHAT TO DO NEXT. CAN HAVE SOME COMFORT THAT WE'RE NOT ASKING THEM TO WONDER IN THE WILDERNESS AND AND PICK A NUMBER OUT OF THIN AIR. THERE ARE STATISTICS AND DATA THAT REALLY CLEARLY GIVE US A DIRECTION ON THIS ON THIS ISSUE. WE PUT ONE MORE POINT OR TWO ON IT AND THEN I'LL SEE THE REST OF MY TIME. WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF THIS BILL AND WE TALK ABOUT STATISTICS AND WE LOOK AT BAR CHARTS? WHAT IS THE VERY HUMAN COST AND I WENT BACK AND LOOKED DEAD AGAIN IS LIMITED DATA THAT THE STATE BAR THE NAME NATIONAL COMMITTEE BAR EXAMINERS PROVIDE? I LOOKED WHAT IS THE IMPACT SINCE. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN OF USING FOURTEEN FORTY IN CALIFORNIA VERSES THE NATIONAL STANDARD OF THIRTEEN FIFTY AM I ESTIMATE USING THE ACTUAL DATA IS. A OVER [inaudible] EIGHT THOUSAND EIGHT THOUSAND QUALIFIED MINORITY CANDIDATES FOR THE BAR EXAM [inaudible] THEY'VE. GONE THROUGH ALL OF THE THE STE CHALLENGES THAT WE HEARD DESCRIBED TODAY. THEY'VE SUCCESSFULLY BEEN TO LAW SCHOOL THEY'RE ELIGIBLE PASS MORAL CHARACTER AND WE HAVE THIS ARTIFACT NUMBER OF FOURTEEN FORTY THAT IS THAT HAS KEPT US FROM HAVING THE QUALITIES AND EXPERIENCE. OF EIGHT THOUSAND MINORITY LAWYERS SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WHO WOULD BE LICENSE IN PRACTICING HERE TODAY. IF WE WERE USING THE NATIONAL STANDARD. THOSE EIGHT THOUSAND LAWYERS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO PRACTICE IN FORTY EIGHT OF THE OTHER JURISDICTIONS. SO WE CLOSE BY ANSWERING THE QUESTION YOU ASKED EARLIER WHICH IS WHEN I HEAR EVERY TIME I DISCUSS THIS. ARE WE JUST TALKING ABOUT DUMBING DOWN THE BAR EXAM. MAY I REMIND US THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE BAR EXAM IS TO MEASURE THE MINIMUM COMPETENCY FOR THE FIRST YEAR PRACTICE OF LAW. NOT WHO ARE THE MOST EXCEPTIONAL LAWYERS NOT WHO ARE THE FORTY AND FIFTY YEAR EXPERIENCED LAWYERS. THE MINIMUM COMPETENCY FOR THE FIRST YEAR PRACTICE OF LAW. WE LOOK AT FORTY EIGHT OTHER JURISDICTIONS. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LAWYERS. AND WE FIND EXACTLY WHAT DEAN RICHARDSON SAID THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE. THAT REQUIRING A SCORE ABOVE THE NATIONAL STANDARD CREATES MORE COMPETENT LAWYERS LAWYERS LESS LIKELY TO BE DISCIPLINED HIGHER INCIDENCE OF GRIEVANCES. IN FACT THE STATISTICS SHOW JUST THE OPPOSITE. SO I WOULD I WOULD LEAVE IT WITH YOU ONE QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK IS WILL WORK IN THE LEGISLATURE DO BECAUSE THIS ISSUE WAS WITH THE SUPREME COURT. I WOULD LEAVE ONE THING TO THINK ABOUT THINK ABOUT TO CONSIDER. I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE UNREASONABLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO SAY THAT. ALL LICENSING EXAMS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT FALLS UNDER THE CRITERIA OF THIS THE CONSTITUTION WHICH ARE PRE EMPLOYMENT LICENSING EXAMS. SHOULD HAVE TO PROVE ON A REGULAR BASIS THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE DISPARATE IMPACT AND IF THEY DO AS DEAN RICHARDSON SAID THE BURDEN SHOULD SHIFT TO THE STATE IN THIS COURT THIS CASE THE SUPREME COURT. I HAVING TO SHOW WHY ANY NUMBER OVER THE PROFESSIONAL MEAN THAT'S ESTABLISHED. NEEDS TO BE JUSTIFIED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] THANK YOU. DOES FUJI THANK YOU. THE PALM I AM HERE AS THE CHAIR OF THE STATE PARKS COUNCIL NEXUS IN FAIRNESS AS OF MS CHAN HAS IS MENTIONED CONGRATULATIONS HARLAN. ALL MAY AND ALSO I AM I I'M HERE A AS A CHILD OF INCARCERATED PARENTS FROM WORLD WAR -- TWO AS A JAPANESE AMERICAN I'M ALSO HERE'S A JUDGE OF THE LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT WITH MY PRESIDING JUDGE HERE MAKING SURE THAT I DON'T MESS UP -- AND I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK THE STAFF I WANT TO THANK THIS COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATION FOR RECOGNIZING. THE IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSITY IN THE PROFESSION AND THE JUDICIARY AT TO THIS TO THE STATE AND TO THE PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I PARTICULARLY WANT TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE. FOR HAVING PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN THE STATE BAR BILL FOR EXAMPLE THE A REQUIREMENT OF THESE HEARINGS AND OF THE REPORT CARD THAT THE LEGISLATURE PUTS TOGETHER OF WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH DIVERSITY IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION BECAUSE IT IS AN ISSUE. WHICH I SEE ON THE BENCH EVERY SINGLE DAY AS AFFECTING THE PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- IT PARTICULARLY WHEN I SAT IN THE THE FAMILY WHAT APARTMENT WHEN I FIRST WENT ON THE BENCH. SEVEN YEARS AGO I SAW THE NEED FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF CULTURAL ISSUES OF GENDER ISSUES OF L. G. B. T. ISSUES OF DISABILITY ISSUES THEY ALL CAME BEFORE US IN THAT COURT. WHERE WE HAD APPROXIMATELY 70% SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS TO UNDERSTAND PEOPLE'S DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW AND TO SEE WHY IT IS THAT NOT EVERY SOLUTION FITS EVERY SINGLE SITUATION? SO THE STATE BAR IS IN A PARTICULARLY GOOD POSITION AND IT NEEDS TO TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE -- TO DIRECT AND COORDINATE EFFORTS TO INCREASE DIVERSITY IN OUR PROFESSION -- SINCE -- TWO THOUSAND SIX CO F. AS WE CALL OURSELVES HAS TAKEN A LEADERSHIP ROLE AS A ST BARTS THINK TANK AND CONSCIENCE. REGARDING DIVERSITY AND THAT IS NOT JUST WE WE TALKED ABOUT ABOUT THE JUDICIAL PIPELINE WE TALKED ABOUT HOW JUDGES ARE ARE APPOINTED. MAIL WITH THERE'S THERE ARE JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS THEIR JUDICIAL ELECTIONS WITH THE VAST VAST MAJORITY OF JUDGES COME ON THROUGH JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. AND SO WE ARE VERY CONCERNED AT CALL AFTER WITH WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR WORKING WITH. THE JUDICIAL APPOINTMENT SECRETARY. WHO WHO ARE WHO SEES EVERY SINGLE APPLICATION LOOKING AT? LOOKING AT TO OF ALL THE GOVERNING BODIES THAT REVIEW THAT THOSE APPLICATIONS THE JUDGE -- WHAT'S CALLED JENNY THE JUDICIAL NOMINEES EVALUATION COMMITTEE THE THAT THE L. LOCAL COMMITTEES IN VARIOUS COUNTIES THAT WHAT USED TO BE THE SECRET COMMITTEE I UNDERSTAND IS IS GOING TO BE NOT SO SECRET. ANYMORE OF WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH -- WITH JOSH GROW BUT NOW JUSTICE GROVE IN. TO TO ENCOURAGE -- THE APPOINTMENT OF OF DIVERSE -- APPLICANTS TO THE JUDICIARY WE ARE WORKING NOW WITH JUSTICE JENKINS WHO HAS A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSITY ON THE BENCH AND AND HAS ALREADY BEEN TRAVELING ALL OVER THE STATE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT MESSAGE IS BEING HEARD ALL OVER. THE CO OUT HIS BEEN KEEPING TRACK OF OF THE APPOINTMENTS AND SOMETIMES HAS BEEN A POSITION TO SAY TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WE THINK THERE'S MORE HERE WE THINK THERE'S LESS HERE. THAN HAS BEEN REPORTED BECAUSE WE HAVE VERY VERY DEEP -- CONNECTIONS WITH THE COMMUNITY AND WERE ABLE TO GO OUT ALL OVER THE STATE IN EVERY SINGLE AREA AND TO SAY GEE WE WE WANTTO MAKE SURE THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE. L. BUT WHAT IS BEING REPORTED OR WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP TRACK WHO IS LGBT -- IF THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO BE REPORTED IN IN THE STATISTICS BECAUSE WE KNOW THOSE GROUPS. WE ALSO INVOLVED WITH IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING TO JENNY TO THE COUNTY BAR ASSOCIATION'S TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THOSE IMPLICIT BIAS IS THAT YOU'RE NOT EVEN AWARE THAT YOU HAVE. DON'T AFFECT THE CHOICE OF JUDGES AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE SEEN MYSELF I SIT ON THE ON SENATOR FEINSTEIN'S COMMITTEE TO POINT FEDERAL JUDGES AND I HAVE ACTUALLY HEARD WITHIN MY COMMITTEE AMONG THE FIRST MEMBER SAYING. ALL THAT PERSON LOOKS LIKE A JUDGE. WHEN THEY'RE A? TALL WHITE MALE. AND TO BE ABLE TO SAY YOU KNOW THAT PERSON DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ME. AND I AM A JUDGE. SO SO THOSE TYPES OF THINGS ARE ARE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE TRAINED IN IT SAID WHAT PART OF THE A PART OF THE MISSION. OF CO AFTER. BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT NOT ALL JUDICIAL CANDIDATES ARE GOING TO BE AS SELF DIRECTED IS JUDGE MISSY IS WHO IS A FORCE OF NATURE. AND I THINK WOULD HAVE BEEN. A JUDGE REGARDLESS OF WHAT SITUATION YOU PUT HER IN BECAUSE SHE'S JUST SO AMAZING JUST AS I EXPECTED THAT MISS PATRICIA PATRICIA IS GOING TO BE A JUDGE REGARDLESS OF ANY BARRIERS THAT ANYBODY PUTS. IN THEIR WAKE BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE WITH EVERYBODY THERE ARE SO MANY CULTURAL ISSUES THERE SO MANY GENDER ISSUES THERE SO MANY FAMILIAL EXPECTATION ISSUES THAT COME INTO THE THE QUESTION OF WHETHER YOU THINK THAT YOU LOOK LIKE. A LAWYER IF YOU THINK YOU LOOK LIKE A JUDGE. AND THE IDEA THAT YOU COULD BECOME A JUDGE I WAS THE FIRST API WOMAN IN A LARGE LAW FIRM IN LOS ANGELES BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WHEN NOBODY LOOKS LIKE ME. AND IT WAS IT WAS NOT THE IT WAS IT WAS REALLY THROUGH. THROUGH AGAIN AT THAT TIME YOU HAD A MENTOR YOURSELF. NOW THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO CAN BE MENTORS PEOPLE LIKE HIGHLAND CHEN PEOPLE LIKE CHRISTOPHER -- AND AND I'M NOT GOING TO PRONOUNCE YOUR NAME BECAUSE I KNOW I'M GOING TO MESS IT UP I'LL BUT EVEN THOUGH I KNOW YOU VERY WELL. BUT BUT THE PEOPLE LIKE JUDGE BRAZIL WHO IS OUT THERE ALL THE TIME -- TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS WHAT THEY CAN DO BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THE COED DOES CALL áP WORKS WITH. THE LAW ACADEMIES WHICH THIS LEGISLATURE'S SO WONDERFUL TO BE FUNDING TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A PROFESSION THAT THEY CAN GO INTO WE WORK WITH THE TWO PLUS TWO PLUS THREE PROGRAM. IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN IT WITH FROM THE BEGINNING WITH A LOT CANNABIS IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THE FOUR YEAR COLLEGES AND LAW SCHOOLS WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO INCREASE THAT PIPELINE. BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT PIPELINE INTO THE PROFESSION THEN WE CANNOT CARE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE QUALIFIED TO BECOME JUDGES. SO. WE ARE INVOLVED WITH LEADERSHIP SUMMITS BUT SOMETHING THE STATE PARK IS A HAS DONE IN THE PAST AND WE'RE HOPING WILL CONTINUE DO IN THE FUTURE. AND MENTORING PROGRAMS ON THAT WE WERE HOPING TO BE ABLE TO START UP TO TO PROVIDE MENTORING TO TO PEOPLE ALL OVER THE STATE. IN ALL SORTS OF AREAS SO THEY CAN UNDERSTAND EVEN IF THEY'RE IN THE COUNTY SAY WHETHER VERY VERY FEW MINORITIES VERY VERY FEW OF THE WOMEN OF PEOPLE OF COLOR LGBT. OF THE DISABILITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN POWER MAYBE NOBODY ON THE BENCH TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS CAN BE SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN ASPIRE. TO AND WE WE WORK WE'VE WE'VE BEEN PUTTING ON TRADITIONALLY FIVE TO SIX JUDICIAL DIVERSITY PROGRAMS WORKING RIGHT NOW WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ON ITS JUDICIAL TOOL KIT WHICH IS WONDERFUL. AND A GREAT RESOURCE ESPECIALLY FOR THE SMALLER COUNTIES. BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT BET I DON'T THINK THAT THAT TO OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL FRANKLY HAS THE HAS THE FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND PUT ON THESE PROGRAMS ALL OVER THE STATE. AS THEY NEED TO BE PUT ON IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS WITH THEIR OPPORTUNITIES CAN BE. AND SO. THIS IS SOMETHING I GET THAT THAT CO AFTER HAS DONE VERY VERY WELL WE HAVE. ARE VERY VERY PROUD OF THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN AND AND OTHER MINORITIES WHO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE BECOME JUDGES. THROUGH THROUGH OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS SECRETARIES OUR WORK WITH WITH -- THE OTHER GROUPS INVOLVING INVOLVING APPOINTMENTS BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. ALL THE TIME AND WE NEED TO BE CONTINUING TO DO THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE AND WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF DATA COLLECTION IS WONDERFUL THE STATE BAR IS DOING THAT AND TAKING A LEADERSHIP ROLE WITH THAT. BUT IN ORDER. TO GET TO CREATE PROGRAMS TO PROMOTE THOSE PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE. ARE AFFECTED AND THEY ALSO ARE BEING BEING FOLLOWED IS SOMETHING THAT CALL AFTER DOES BEST. AND SO -- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH C. LA WHICH IS DOING AN AMAZING JOB WITH THIS WITH -- THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE GOVERNOR WITH BAR GROUPS TO CREATE PROGRAMS TO INCREASE EDUCATION TO INCREASE MENTORING AND TO ENCOURAGE THOSE. WHO WANT TO ENTER THE PROFESSION WHO WANT TO EXCEL IN THAT PROFESSION AND WHO WANT TO THEN GET TO THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THAT PROFESSION -- SO THAT WE HAVE THE DIVERSITY THAT ALL OF US ARE TALKING ABOUT THE WE ALL UNDERSTAND IS SO. IMPORTANT TO THE HEALTH OF OUR STATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU. JUDGE WAS A GOOD MORNING AND THAT IT REALLY IS A PLEASURE TO BE HERE AND I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- FOR HOLDING THESE HEARINGS I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR TAKING SUCH AN INTEREST IN DIVERSITY SOMETHING THAT IS SO IMPORTANT. TO MANY OF US HERE. AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANELISTS WHO WHO SHOWED UP TODAY I'M LAST SO -- I'LL TRY TO KEEP IT BRIEF BECAUSE I GUESS I'M STANDING BETWEEN LUNCH. BUT I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANELISTS WHO BEEN HERE -- IT'S BEEN SO ENLIGHTENING FOR ME. AND I COME HERE AS THE CO CHAIR. OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROVIDING ACCESS FAIRNESS. AND I'M ALSO THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT. AND I HAVE THE DISTINCTION OF BEING THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN PRESIDING JUDGE OF LAWCENTER SUPERIOR COURT. STICKING A HUNDRED YEARS. FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. AND TO MY JOURNEY I WAS THE FIRST SUPERVISING JUDGES CIVIL FOR THE LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT. AND WE'RE HEAD OVER TO PROVIDE THE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE JUDGES. I WAS FIRST ASSISTANT PRESIDING JUDGE FOR TWO YEARS AND NOW THE PRESIDING JUDGE. WHERE WE HAVE THE LA SPIRIT CHORDS LARGE COURT AT THE STATE FROM THE TRIAL COURT? OVER FIVE HUNDRED JUDGES SEVENTY COMMISSIONER SO. IT'S A BIG JOB [inaudible] BUT DIVERSITY IS A AN EVEN BIGGER JOB. AND MORE IMPORTANT TO OUR WHOLE STATE THAT WE HAVE DIVERSITY. AND ONE OF THINGS THAT I'VE LEARNED I'VE BEEN THE COACH HERE NOW. FOR ABOUT A YEAR FOR THE PROVIDING ACCESS IN FAIRNESS -- COMMITTEE. AND ONE OF THE MANDATES AND A MAJOR CHARGE OR PROVIDING -- ACCESS AND OF THE ACCESS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE INCLUDES A FOCUS ON INCREASING DIVERSITY. IN THE JUDICIARY -- ARE CHIEF JUSTICE HAS SHOWN A TREMENDOUS COMMITMENT. AND IMMENSE DEDICATION TO PROMOTING DIVERSITY IN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. AS THE GOVERNING BODY FOR THE CALIFORNIA COURT SYSTEM. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAS FOR MANY YEARS PERSONAL THE GOAL OF INCREASING DIVERSITY. IN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. UNDER THE OUTSTANDING LEADERSHIP OF OUR CHIEF JUSTICE. TO UNDERSTAND TO BE RESPONSIBLE TO THE NEEDS OF COURT USES FROM DIVERSE CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS ETHNICITIES. WE NEED A BENCH THAT REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF THE STATE'S RESIDENTS. THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS ANNUAL TRACKING AND PUBLICATION OF JUDICIAL DEMOGRAPHICS DATA PROVIDES. A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE BASELINE FOR ALL GROUPS INTERESTED ADVANCING DIVERSITY. IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND THIRTEEN YEARS OF REPORTING THE DATA SHOWS STEADILY INCREASING DIVERSITY. BUT WE STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GO AND THERE ARE STILL LOTS OF WORK TO BE DONE TO CONTINUE THE INCREASE IN DIVERSITY. NO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE COUNCIL HAS DONE IS THEY'VE SPONSORED SOME JUDICIAL. SUMMITS. 200-062-00011 IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THESE ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE DO IT THE SUMMITS AND I PARTICIPATED IN MANY OF THEM. IS WE HAVE PANELISTS NAMELY JUDGES LAWYERS OFTENTIMES A JUDICIAL APPOINTMENT SECRETARY WILL SHOW UP FOR EXAMPLE -- NOW JUSTICE JOSH GROBAN WHEN HE WAS ACTING IN THE ROLE OF JUDICIAL POINT SECRETARY HE WOULD OFTENTIMES A TEN THESE DIVERSITY SUMMITS. AND WHAT WE TALK ABOUT AND EXPLAIN TO APPLICANTS THE PROCESS FOR BECOMING A JUDGE WHAT IS THE GOVERNOR LOOKING FOR WHAT DO YOU WANT TO STRESS IN YOUR APPLICATION. AND THIS IS VERY ENLIGHTENING BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT TAKES AND A USE MYSELF ON HIS EXAMPLE -- WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE'S EXAMPLES AND UNFORTUNATELY I I KIND OF FIT INTO THAT SAME THEME I WAS THE FIRST IN MY FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE -- WHEN I GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL I HAD THE DISTINCTION OF HAVING ONE OF THE LOWEST GPAS OF ANY GRADUATING SENIOR? SO I PROBABLY WENT TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. WHERE AFTER TWO YEARS I WAS ABLE TO TRANSFER TO THE UCLA? AND I SHE'S MY **** DEGREE AT UCLA THEN WENT ON TO UCLA LAW SCHOOL. AND WHEN I JOIN THE COUNTY COUNSEL'S OFFICE AFTER A PASSED THE BAR EXAM. I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICANS TO WORK AT THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY COUNSEL'S OFFICE. WHICH DIDN'T START HIRING WOMEN UNTIL THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES EVEN THOUGH THE OPPOSITE BEEN IN EXISTENCE SINCE ABOUT THE NINETEEN TWENTIES. AND I CAME ON IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES. SO IT'S AN INTERESTING STORY. BUT AN IMPORTANT STORY BECAUSE THAT **** IN HELPED SHAPE WHO WE ARE. AND EXPLAINS WHY WE HAVE THIS COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY THAT YOU SEE OF MIKE'S MYSELF AND ALL THE OTHER PANELISTS -- WHO SPOKEN TO YOU THIS MORNING IT COMES FROM LIFE EXPERIENCE IT COMES FROM? WHAT WE'VE HAD TO GO? FOR SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE COUNCIL HAS DONE IN TERMS OF WE TALK ABOUT. DIVERSITY PATHWAYS. AND ONE OF THINGS WE DO IS WE FOCUS ON HIRING SUBORDINATE JUDICIAL OFFICERS OUR COMMISSIONERS REFEREES -- THERE'S OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY I THINK IN THE STATE MANY OF THOSE -- COMMISSIONERS GO ON TO BE JUDGES THINK OF RECENTLY I THINK THE NUMBERS ARE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE HAVE BEEN APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S IMPORTANT WHEN YOU LOOK AT COMMISSIONERS AS THEY ARE SELECTED BY THE JUDGES. SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE SELECTION COMMITTEES. ARE MADE UP AND HAVE DIVERSITY. BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY AND SELECTION PEOPLE SELECT PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE VAMP. SO ONE OF THE THINGS WERE FOCUSING ON IN LOS ANGELES WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE HAVING A JUDICIAL -- COMMISSIONER SELECTION PROCESS COMING UP VERY SOON AND FORTUNATELY I'M IN I'M THE PRESIDING JUDGE SO I'M GONNA PICK. IT WAS ON THAT SELECTION COMMITTEE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I CAN GUARANTEE IS THAT IT WILL BE DIVERSE. I'M EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON THE COMMITTEE JUST TO MAKE SURE WE DO HAVE DIVERSITY. AND I HAVE A GOAL OF MAKING SURE WE HAVE EQUAL NUMBER OF MEN AND WOMEN. ND AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS ASIAN AMERICANS ON THAT COMMITTEE AS WELL AS WHITES SO THAT IT REFLECTS WHO ARE COURT IS. IN WHO ARE COMMUNITIES ANOTHER THING THAT THE COUNCIL SUPPORTS. WE HAVE VOLUNTEER ATTORNEY SERVING AS TEMPORARY JUDGES. AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE USE THEM IN TRAFFIC MUSEUM IN SMALL CLAIMS. AND AGAIN THAT SELECTION PROCESS WHICH IS DONE BY THE JUDGES. THOSE PEOPLE ON THAT SELECTION COMMITTEE HAVE TO BE DIVERSE. BECAUSE AGAIN WE GO BACK TO THE YOU PICK PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE YOU. SO WE'VE GOT TO HAVE WOMEN WE'VE GOT TO HAVE MINORITIES TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE DIVERSITY. IN THOSE TWO AREAS BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES THAT'S A GOOD TRAINING GROUND. FOR SOMEBODY TO BECOME A JUDGE TO BE TO GET THE EXPERIENCE TO GET THE KNOWLEDGE TO GET THE RECOGNITION THEY NEED TO BECOME A JUDGE SO THE COUNCIL I'M I'M PROUD TO SAY. THE BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN MAKING SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS. ANOTHER THING THAT THE COUNCIL FOCUSING ON IS MANAGING AND AVOIDING IMPLICIT BIAS. SO KIND OF WHAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT JUST PREVIOUSLY WHEN YOU HAVE A SELECTION GROUP. AND IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE YOU. THAT'S KIND OF THAT IMPLICIT BIAS COMING INTO PLAY WHERE YOU AGAIN WE WE PICK PEOPLE LIKE US THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT WERE BAD PEOPLE IF WE DO THAT. BUT IT'S JUST THAT IMPLICIT BIAS THAT WE HAVE. SO IN RECOGNITION OF THIS. AND WE AGAIN [inaudible] WE NEED TO HAVE A DIVERSE BRANCH -- WE HAVE TO HAVE A BROUGHT THE BENCH HAS A BROAD RESPONSIBILITY RESPECTING. AND UNDERSTANDING THE DIVERSITY OF THOSE WHO COME TO THE COURT. SO THE COUNCIL IS PROMOTED IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING. WHICH IS INTEGRATED INTO THE COUNCIL'S BIANNUAL EDUCATION PLAN FOR JUDGES AND BRANCH EMPLOYEES AS WELL. AND THE CHIEF JUSTICE AS DIRECTED REVIEW OF THESE PROGRAMS TO SEE WHAT IMPROVEMENTS. MAY BE NEEDED IN THE FUTURE. ALSO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR DIVERSITY THAT WE SUPPORT THE STUDENT PIPELINE. WE HAVE A PROGRAM CALLED JUSTICE COURT. WHICH WE HAVE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AS WELL AS COLLEGE STUDENTS AND GRAD STUDENTS WHO ACT IN SELF HELP CENTERS. TO OUR VARIOUS COURTS AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE COUNCIL IS PROMOTED LOS ANGELES WE HAVE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY JUSTICE COURSE STUDENTS. WHO ARE HELPING TO OUR SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS PREPARE MATTERS AND TO GET READY FOR COURT? WE'VE ALSO GOT ONGOING COMMUNITY OUTREACH EFFORTS OUTREACH EFFORTS THAT THE COUNCIL SUPPORTS -- IN TERMS OF WORKING WITH LOCAL LAW SCHOOLS -- WE WORK WITH THE JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATIVE FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM TO PROVIDE INTERNS -- OVER THREE HUNDRED I BELIEVE. AND WE ALSO HAVE BEEN THREE HUNDRED SCHOOLS AND THIRTY COUNTIES -- STUDENTS TEACHING CIVICS. AS WELL AS JUDGES AND EVEN THE CHIEF JUSTICE HAS A PROGRAM. AND SHE'S BEEN A LEADER IN THE ROLE AND A MILE IN THIS AREA. TO HER MANY OUTREACH EFFORTS AND CIVICS EDUCATION INITIATIVE LAUNCHED IN. TWENTY TWELVE NOW ONE FINAL IMPORTANT PROJECT AND IS CO CHAIR OF THE COUNCIL'S ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PROVIDING ACCESS AND FAIRNESS. TOGETHER WITH COURT OF APPEAL JUSTICE LAURIE THE LINE. I'M EXCITED TO SHARE THE INFORMATION ON THE JUDICIAL DIVERSITY TOOL KIT. THIS TOOK IT STEMS FROM THE OFFICIAL OVERSEE SUMMIT IN. TWO THOUSAND TEN FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL PRODUCED A TOOL KIT OF PATHWAYS TO ACHIEVING JUDICIAL DIVERSITY IN CALIFORNIA COURTS. THAT IS AVAILABLE ONLINE AT THE GENERAL COUNSEL WEBSITE. LAST YEAR THE CHIEF JUSTICE INITIATED AN EFFORT TO REVITALIZE AN UPDATE THIS RESOURCE. AND TO CREATE THE JUDICIAL DIVERSITY TOOL KIT VERSION TWO POINT -- OH MY COMMITTEE IS EXPECTED TO LAUNCH THE REVAMPED ONLINE TOOL KIT LATER THIS YEAR. WITH NEW INFORMATION NEW APPROACHES AND NEW RESOURCES. WE'LL HAVE A DYNAMIC PROFIT FORM INCORPORATING ONLINE LAKES. TO STAY CURRENT WITH WHAT OTHERS ARE DOING IN THIS AREA OF DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION. THE GOAL OF THE DIVERSITY TOOL KIT IS TO CREATE A RESOURCE THAT PROVIDES MULTIPLE IN PRACTICAL WAYS. FOR LOCAL COURTS AND BAR ASSOCIATIONS TO ENGAGE GUY AND MENTOR POTENTIAL JUDICIAL APPLICANTS [inaudible] IN ADDITION. FOR THE JUDGES. I THINK IT IS SO VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ENGAGED. AND ALTHOUGH WE HAVE THE TOOL KIT AND IT'S VERY HELPFUL. AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUTUR JUDICIAL SUMMITS AGAIN WHICH ARE VERY HELPFUL. IN ORDER TO APPOINT A SECRETARY MARTIN JENKINS IS GONNA BE DISSIPATE. AND SOME OF THESE JUDICIAL SUMMITS. WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS FOR JUDGES AND THIS IS WHERE I HAVE TO LOOK TO MY COLLEAGUES. AROUND THE BENCH. WE HAVE TO BECOME MORE ENGAGED WE HAVE TO BE MORE HANDS ON THE DIFFERENCE TO ACHIEVING DIVERSITY IS AND IT'S BEEN ALLUDED TO HERE ALREADY IS. YOU HAVE TO HAVE MENTORING. YOU HAVE TO HAVE SUPPORT I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE. BECAUSE OFTENTIMES SOMEBODY HAS TO BELIEVE IN YOU IN ORDER FOR YOU TO BELIEVE IN YOURSELF. AND THAT'S WHERE JUDGES HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE. THE MOST IMPORTANT INFLUENCE ON ME AND BECOMING A JUDGE. IS ONE ANOTHER JUDGE TOLD ME. I THINK YOU SHOULD BECOME PROJECT. THAT REALLY TURNED ON THE LIGHT FOR ME. BECAUSE GROWING UP I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE JUDGES DIDN'T KNOW ANY LAWYERS. AS I SAID THE FIRST IN MY FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE BUT A JUDGE WHO TOOK THE TIME TO TELL ME AFTER A TRIAL. THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU THINK YOU REALLY ARE PURSUE A JUDICIAL CAREER. THAT'S WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE AND THAT IS SO VERY VERY IMPORTANT. WE HAVE A LOT OF MINORITY GROUPS THAT ARE INVOLVED -- FROM AFRICAN AMERICAN JUDGES THE LATINO JUDGES THE ASIAN JUDGES WERE TRIED TO MENTOR. JUDICIAL APPLICANTS BUT PART OF THAT PROCESS WITH WHAT WE DO IS WE IDENTIFY. THOSE LAWYERS WHO WE THINK COULD BE GOOD JUDGES BECAUSE JUDGES WE BELIEVE OUR ANALYSTS LIKE SAY FOR THE GROUP THAT I BELONG. TO WHO BETTER THAN US TO IDENTIFY WHO CAN BE A GOOD JUDGE WE SEE THEM EVERY DAY WE SEE THE LAWYERS. WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THE PROCESS. SO FOR JUDGES IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE ENGAGED IN THE MENTORING THE LEADERSHIP. WE ALSO HAVE TO GOING TO THE HIGH SCHOOLS WE ALSO HAVE TO GOING TO THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS. BECAUSE THAT PIPELINE STARTS VERY VERY EARLY ON SO AT THE LA SUPERIOR COURT WE HAVE A PROGRAM WE WILL RECALL IT -- THE WOMEN'S CONFERENCE AND THE MEN'S CONFERENCE AND ACTUALLY JUST -- JAY IS INVOLVED IN THAT WERE VERY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. INTO THE COURT AND IT'S BEEN PRETTY MUCH HALF A DAY IN THE COURT. TALKING TO JUDGES LISTENING THE PANELS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY ONE ONE ON ONE FACE TO FACE COMMUNICATION WITH JUDGES. SO REALLY I THINK. WE AS JUDGES HAVE A TREMENDOUS ROLE TO PLAY. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ACHIEVE DIVERSITY. THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. IT CAN BE DONE. ANOTHER THING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT IS FOR STUDENTS AND AND THIS IS BEEN TALKED ABOUT BY A LOT OF PEOPLE. TERMS OF GETTING INTO LAW SCHOOL. YOU KNOW WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR PREPARATION COURSES BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WHETHER IT'S GETTING INTO LAW SCHOOL PREPARING FOR THE LSAT PREPARE FOR THE BAR EXAM THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME FORM OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BAR EXAM IT COSTS HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS. TO TAKE THAT EXAM PREP COURSE WHICH I'VE HEARD MENTIONED EARLIER CAN COST THREE TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT MORE THAN ONCE WHICH IS INDICATED IN TERMS OF WHAT MINORITIES HAVE TO DO. THE FINANCIAL COST. CAN THEN BECOME A PERIOD. JUST LIKE THAT FINANCIAL COSTS BECAUSE CAN BECOME A BEAR GOING TO LAW SCHOOL. BECAUSE YOU GOT TO TAKE THE LSAT TESTS MAYBE HAVE TO TAKE A MORE THAN ONCE WE NEED A PREPARATION COURSE YOU'VE ALREADY GOT COLLEGE BILLS. ON TOP OF THAT SO SOME KIND OF SCHOLARSHIP FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ONE OF THINGS WE DO A LOS ANGELES THIS WEEK. VIOLENT VOLUNTEER LAWYERS VOLUNTEER JUDGES HELP STUDENTS PREPARE FOR THE BAR EXAM. AND I WAS LISTENING TO THE DISCUSSION HERE ABOUT. THE CUT SCORE. AND PART OF THAT IS. GETTING PEOPLE PREPARE THE COMING RIGHT OUT OF LAW SCHOOL AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN DO TO HELP US MAKE SURE THEY GET THE PREPARATION COURSES. NOT JUST ONCE THEY LEAVE LAW SCHOOL. BUT I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THERE SHOULD BE A PREPARATION COURSE AS PART OF THE LAW SCHOOL CURRICULA. MAYBE THAT THIRD YEAR LAST SEMESTER SOME KIND OF BAR PREPARATION COURSE TO GET STUDENTS READY. AND AGAIN THE FINANCIAL ASPECT MONEY TO PAY FOR THESE PROGRAMS THE PAY FOR THE BAR EXAM TO PAY FOR REPEAT COURSE. IT'S A TWO DAY EXAM TO PAY FOR A HOTEL SUITE YOU CAN TAKE WITH THEM AND BE FRESH IN THE MORNING WHEN YOU GET THERE FOR SIX HOURS OF TESTING EACH DAY. THOSE KINDS OF THINGS ARE IMPORTANT. SO AS AS I LOOK AT DIVERSITY I'M VERY PROUD OF WHAT. CHIEF JUSTICE IS DONE. I MEAN SHE SEVEN AND MEN'S COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY -- YOU LOOK AT THE MAKE UP OF THE JUDICIAL COUNTY LOOK AT THE MAKE UP OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEES WELL WE SEE INCLUSION THERE AND IT'S AN EFFORT THAT CONTINUES. AND A LOT OF IT HAS TO COM FROM COURT LEADERSHIP. WE HAVE TO STEP UP. AND UNFORTUNATELY BEING THE ONLY ONE OF THE FEW AFRICAN AMERICAN PRESIDING JUDGES OUT OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. I HAVE A LITTLE INFLUENCE IN LA BUT NOT AS MUCH STATEWIDE. OKAY SO I TRY TO FOCUS ON THAT. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY SO IT'S IT'S AN IMPORTANT JOB. THE COUNCIL I KNOW IS COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE WE HAVE DIVERSITY WE'VE GOT PROGRAMS IN PLACE -- TALKED ABOUT THE JUSTICE CORPS PROGRAM WE ALSO HAVE INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS THE ONLY WHO THE COUNCIL BUT THROUGH. SOME OF THE VARIOUS COURTS THAT THE CHIEF STRONGLY SUPPORTS AND I KNOW THE BARS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. I KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA LAWYERS ASSOCIATION WHICH HAS A ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS. AS WELL CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION THEY'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH -- DIVERSITY PROGRAMS IN TERMS OF JUDICIAL SUMMITS. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN. HAVE LAWYERS AND JUDGES ENGAGED IN THE RECRUITMENT PROCESS. BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO REALIZE IS THAT ONCE A MINORITY BECOMES A JUDGE. THEN THERE'S ALWAYS THE PROBLEM OF RETENTION. BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES WHEN AS A JUDICIAL ELECTION WHICH HAPPENS EVERY SIX YEARS MINORITY JUDGES USUALLY DRAW CHALLENGE IN THOSE COUNTIES WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF MINORITY. RESIDENTS SO WE HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR THAT IN THERE IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY FOR JUDICIAL ELECTIONS INJURES RETENTION. BUT THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM THAT SOMETIMES GETS OVERLOOKED AS WELL ONCE WE GET THEM ON THE BENCH. WE GOT TO KEEP THEM ON THE BENCH. AND OFTENTIMES THAT VERY FIRST TIME UP. MINORITY CANDIDATE WILL FACE AN ELECTION CHALLENGE. SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. AND I KNOW THE COUNCIL THAT'S A CONCERN OF THE COUNCIL. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE IN LOS ANGELES IS IS WE'VE STARTED A A PACK FOR THE JUDGES -- TO HELP THEM FINANCE -- THEIR CAMPAIGNS WHERE THE JUDGES MAKE. MONTHLY CONTRIBUTIONS. ARE THE CJ ALSO HAS A PET. DACHSHUND SAME WAY. SO. I FINALLY FIGURED OUT THAT'S WHAT THAT MEANS LIKE. A A SUBTLE REMINDER OKAY THAT'S WHAT THAT MEANS. ALL RIGHT I'M A LITTLE SLOW BUT GONNA FINALLY GOT IT. SO ANYWAY I I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR TAKING THE TIME. TO PAY SO MUCH ATTENTION TO SHINE A LIGHT. ON THIS ISSUE IT IS SO VERY IMPORTANT. HOPEFULLY SOMETHING CAN BE DONE ABOUT THE BAR EXAM CUTS GORE I I WHAT I HEARD THIS MORNING WAS. VERY VERY COMPELLING. AND AGAIN FOR ME AND ALL THE JUDGES OF MY COLLEAGUES. WE HAVE TO TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE AND WE HAVE TO BE INVOLVED SO THANK YOU FOR LISTENING THANK YOU [inaudible] ALTHOUGH. YOU PHRASE SOMETHING IN A WAY THAT THAT IS ALWAYS BOTHER ME A LITTLE BIT ANY BRING IT UP WITH THE OTHER PAN AROUND TESTING. BUT SINCE YOU HAD BROUGHT IT UP. THIS NOTION OF MAYBE ASKING THE LAW SCHOOLS TO TEACH THAT TO PREP FOR THE BAR EXAM WHICH I'M NOT. ACTUALLY ADVOCATING BECAUSE I THINK THAT WOULD BE A MISTAKE IF WE SET UP AN EDUCATION SYSTEM TO TEACH TO A TEST I I THINK THAT'S A MISTAKE. BUT WE HAVE THIS INDUSTRY THAT WAS CREATED AROUND BAR SCHOOL PREP COURSES. AND IT IT'S BECOME. NECESSARY TO DO A PREP COURSE AND EVERY STUDENT GOES THROUGH IT AND AND IT SORT OF BECOMES PART OF THE LOWER. EVEN. UNDER YEARS AGO WHEN I WENT THROUGH LAW SCHOOL SO. THAT THE LOWER ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO AND ALL. BUT IT WHY. BECAUSE IF THE IF THE BAR EXAM WERE TESTING ON COMPETENCE. FOR SOMEBODY IS COMING OUT OF LAW SCHOOL OR WHO HAD BEEN. PRACTICING IN ANOTHER STATE OR WHO HAD GONE THROUGH INSTEAD OF GOING TO LAW SCHOOL BUT HAD. HAD IN IN TURN DOOR OR WORKED WITH A AS THE CALIFORNIA LAW. CURRENTLY ALLOWS BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY'S REALLY DUMB THIS RECENTLY. TO BE WORK FOR AN ATTORNEY AND AND AND TO GET PRATT'S [inaudible] THAT PREPARATION. THE EXAM SHOULD BE A COMBINATION OF THAT PREPARATION RATHER THAN SOMETHING THAT STANDS ON ITS OWN AND I CAN REMEMBER BACK THAT. SOMEBODY HAD TALKED WILLOWS LAW SCHOOL THAT THAT WE LEARNED. THREE DIFFERENT DISTINCT TYPES OF LAW. THAT HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH EACH OTHER THE FIRST IS WHAT YOU LEARN IN LAW SCHOOL. AND THE SECOND IS WHAT YOU LEARN FOR THE BAR EXAM AND THE THIRD IS WHAT YOU LEARN WHEN YOU PRACTICE. AND THERE'S NO IN RELATION BETWEEN ANY OF THOSE. A BIT OF A JOKE BUT YET SOME REAL AND THAT'S UNDERSCORED BY YOUR STATEMENT ABOUT HAVING TO TAKE THESE PREP EXAMS TO TO BE ABLE TO BE. SUCCESSFUL AT TAKING THE BAR. EXAM SO DOESN'T THAT MEAN THAT THE BAR EXAM ITSELF. DOESN'T RELATE TO THE STUDY'S TO THE PREPARATION THAT FOLKS HAVE GONE THROUGH A WOULD. THIRTY SEVEN START IF I MAY ADDRESS THAT GAP QUESTION BECAUSE THE BAR ACTUALLY IS UNDERTAKEN RIGHT NOW A PRACTICE ANALYSIS I MEAN YOU ASK EXACTLY THE RIGHT QUESTION IS THE BAR EXAM TESTING. FOR WHAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY NEED TO KNOW TO BE MINIMALLY COMPETENT LAWYERS ENTERING THE PROFESSION. AND TO THE STATE BAR RIGHT NOW IS UNDERGOING AN ANALYSIS UP WHAT ARE THE SKILLS THAT A FIRST YEAR ATTORNEY NEEDS TO KNOW. RIGHT I MEAN I CAN TELL YOU AS A PARTNER IN A LAW FIRM WE HAVE ASSOCIATES COMING IN THE DOOR OF OUR VERY LEE LAW FIRM. WHO HAVE NEVER LEARNED HOW TO DRAFT THE DECLARATION? RIGHT BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE PRACTICING LAWYER THAT IS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW HOW TO DO. I AM SO THAT STUDY IS GOING TO BE HUGELY USEFUL TO LOOKING AT WHETHER WE NEED TO RECONSTITUTE THE BAR EXAM TO REALLY ADDRESS THOSE SKILLS THAT PEOPLE NEED IN THEIR FIRST YEAR. OTHERWISE ANY GOOD PARALEGAL -- LEGAL SECRETARY COULD PROBABLY SIT DOWN AND TAKE THE BAR. BECAUSE OF THE THE PRACTICAL ASPECT IN IN THE FIRST YEAR LAW STUDENT. IF THEY DON'T QUICKLY MAKE FRIENDS WITH THE PARALEGALS AND LEGAL SECRETARIES WILL READILY STRUGGLE THE SECRETARY AT YOU KNOW PROPERTIES A BUNDLE OF RIGHTS. YOU KNOW THAT. I THINK IT'S SORT OF A TWO PART QUESTION WHICH IS YOU KNOW DOES THE BAR EXAM TESTS WHICH YOU NEED TO DO TO BE A TO BE A GOOD LAWYER. THE NEXT QUESTION IS DOES LAW SCHOOL PREPARE YOU TO BE A GOOD LAWYER. AND AND THE STEPS IN BETWEEN AND I LOOK FOR EXAMPLE I WENT TO BERKELEY AND THEY HAVE IT HAD. A TREMENDOUS INCREASE WHEN WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS CLINICAL EDUCATION NOW IT'S ALL ABOUT THEY HAVE. DOZENS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF CLINICAL EXPERIENCES THAT YOU CAN GO THROUGH ALL OF WHICH ARE GOING TO TEACH YOU HOW TO DO A DECLARATION. SO IT IT TAT BUT IT MADE IT MAY OR MAY NOT PREPARE YOU TO TAKE THE BAR EXAM I DON'T KNOW. YEAH I THINK I DIDN'T AND LAW SCHOOLS IT SHOULD BE ALSO TEACHING. HOW TO THINK HOW TO ANALYZE HOW TO DO THOSE KINDS OF IN DEPTH THINGS THAT DON'T NECESSARILY COME ON THAT'S FINE BUT THEN THERE'S THE PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF IT IN AND? FOR YOU AS WE HAVE. THE AND I WANT TO ANSWER THIS BUT ALSO YOUR SCHOOL THING YOU MENTIONED WHERE YOUR SCHOOLS ARE. YOUR PIPELINE IF YOU WILL OF THE INTO RURAL AREAS. YES DAD WHERE THERE'S A LACK OF ATTORNEYS WHERE THERE IS A LACK OF HI A PAID EXPENSIVE LAW FIRMS. SO WE A LOT OF THE THE STUDENTS THAT YOU TEACH THEN GO OUT INTO AREAS THAT ARE PROBABLY UNDERSERVED BY NUMBERS OF LAWYERS. THAT HAVE TO BE COME OUT OF SCHOOL READ THE TACKLE ALL HOST OF DIFFERENT THINGS BECAUSE ONCE YOU PASSED THE BAR EXAM. WERE QUALIFIED TO DO LOTS OF THINGS WHICH IS THE PROMISES I WOULD SERIOUSLY QUESTION. BUT TECHNICALLY QUALIFIED TO DO A LOT OF THINGS RIGHT SO HOW DO YOU PREPARE YOUR STUDENTS THAN THIS PIPELINE TO GO OUTINTO THESE RURAL COMMUNITIES. AND TO BE EFFECTIVE SO THE GOOD THE GOOD NEWS IS AS LEGAL EDUCATION IS INVOLVING. I DON'T THINK IT'S UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT BELOW IN THE COURSE OF A LARGER DEGREE TO DO ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING WE'VE JUST DISCUSSED HERE. THERE'S THERE'S NO REASON WE CAN'T INTEGRATE ADDITIONAL CLINICAL TRAINING. WE'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR OVER A DECADE IT WORKS VERY WELL I THINK ALL OF THE MAJOR LAW SCHOOL ALL LAW SCHOOLS I BELIEVE OF INTEGRATED MORE CLINICAL TRAINING BECAUSE WE'RE LISTENING TO THE BENCH IN THE BAR. AND AND THE PRACTICING LAWYERS WHO SAY THIS WHAT WE WANT THEM TO DO. IT THE SKILLS TO PASS THE BAR EXAMINER TO EXCLUSIVE TO ANALYTICAL REASONING READING COMPREHENSION WRITING THESE ARE THE SAME THINGS WE DO IS LAWYERS. IT MAY NOT BE IN EXACTLY THE SAME FORMAT AS THE BAR EXAM. IT IS UNUSUAL THAT WE'VE NOW HAVE 50% OF THE CALIFORNIA BAR EXAM THAT OUR MBT QUESTIONS THAT HAVE NO RELATION TO THE PRACTICE OF LAW WHATSOEVER. BUT THE ESSAY EXAMS IN THE PERFORMANCE EXAMS ARE ARE NOT. A NOT FUNCTIONALLY UNLIKE THE WAY WE PRACTICE LAW. IN THE DAY TO IDENTIFY ISSUES ON OF THE RULES. DO THE ANALYSIS AND AND DRAFT A CONCLUSION. SO I THINK IT IS REALISTIC TO EXPECT US AND TO DEMAND. US AS LEGAL EDUCATORS TO BE ABLE TO DO ALL OF THESE THINGS WE CAN WALK AND CHEW GUM AT THE SAME TIME WE CAN DO ALL OF THESE THINGS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND FOR OUR STUDENTS. WITHIN THE CURRICULUM THAT WE HAVE. AS TO THE ISSUE OF RURAL EDUCATE OVERLY WORLD SERVING LAWYERS AS A YOU KNOW WHEN WE WERE HERE TWO YEARS AGO IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THERE WERE A NUMBER OF STUDIES THAT REPORTED THAT SHOWED. THAT THE MAJORITY OF THOSE SERVING THE RURAL COMMUNITIES OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS A VAST. AREA OF CALIFORNIA COME OUT OF SCHOOLS THAT ARE OPPORTUNITY LAW SCHOOLS NOT ONLY LIKE OURS LIKE MANY OF THE LAW SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE AND THE REAL TRAGEDY IS WE SUCCEED ON THE INPUT SIDE WITH NOW 52% OF THOSE WHO SAT FOR THE JULY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BAR EXAM. BEING MINORITIES COMING FROM THOSE COMMUNITIES INTERESTED IN GOING BACK INTO THOSE COMMUNITIES AND YET HAVING THE BARRIER OF THE FOURTEEN FORTY STAND IN THEIR WAY OF GOING OUT SERVING THOSE COMMUNITIES AS LAWYERS. FORTUNATELY MANY OF THEM STILL SERVE THOSE COMMUNITIES THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE EFFORTS ARE BLUNTED BY NOT BEING ABLE TO DO IT AS A LAWYER. AND IF I COULD JUST ADD ON THAT POINT ABOUT THE NEED FOR RURAL SERVING ATTORNEYS IT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE LEGALLY COMMUNITIES LOOKING CLOSELY AT OUR FOUNDATION. PROVIDES FELLOWSHIP OPPORTUNITIES FOR NEW ATTORNEYS TO PRACTICE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES SO THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE BREAKING THROUGH THE BARRIERS AND DEFYING THE ODDS BUT ONE BIG CHALLENGE RELATES TO THE COST OF REPAIRING YOUR LOANS -- AS A LAW STUDENT AS A PUBLIC INTEREST ATTORNEY IT IS A TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE AND A COLLEAGUE IN THE AUDIENCE SELENA COPELAND FROM THE LEGAL AID ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA'S LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN INCREASE THE PIPELINE AS WELL AS OUR ORGANIZATION. OF ATTORNEYS WHO WILL SERVE THE COMMUNITY. IN THE MORE REMOTE PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE THE ACCESS TO JUSTICE ISSUE IS EXTREMELY PROFOUND. ONE THING I JUST WANT TO TACK ON SINCE I'M TALKING ABOUT. LEGAL AID ATTORNEYS IS THAT I MEAN WE SHOULD THE THE BAR PROVIDED INFORMATION IN THEIR MARCH FIFTEENTH REPORT TO THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT THE DIVERSITY OF NONPROFIT ATTORNEYS AND I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT. ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF NONPROFIT ATTORNEYS ARE WOMEN AND SO IT IS AN AREA OF THE LAW WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT STRIDES -- AND AT THE SAME TIME. ONLY ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THOSE ATTORNEYS WHO ARE WORKING IN LEGAL AID -- ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR ATTORNEYS OF COLOUR SO WHILE THERE IS GREAT STRIDES AND I THINK THERE ARE LESSONS TO LEARN FROM THE LEGALLY COMMUNITY ABOUT INCREASING DIVERSITY IN THE PROFESSION OVERALL. IN ITS LOOKING AT THE THINGS THAT I HAD MENTIONED ABOUT CREATING. ORGANIZATIONS THAT. YOU CAN REALLY GET A LOT OF JOB SATISFACTION -- WHERE YOU CAN YOU KNOW FOR FILLED THE YOU KNOW THE PURPOSE THAT YOU CAME TO LAW SCHOOL IN IN IN THE VERY BEGINNING? TO TO DO LIKE -- MISS PROGRESS THE SAID WHEN SHE TESTIFIED SHE WANTS TO SERVE HER COMMUNITY SO WE NEED TO LOOK. LONGITUDE EARLY AT THE PIPELINE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING TO GETTING ATTORNEYS WHERE THEY NEED TO BE TO ADDRESS THE JUSTICE GAP -- BUT LOOKING AT SOME OF THE SUCCESS OF THE NO LEGALLY COMMUNITY. I THINK IT'S A GOOD PLACE TO START. SO DO WE HAVE TOO MANY ATTORNEYS IN CALIFORNIA. IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE LEGALLY COMMUNITY THERE IS A DRASTIC NEED FOR MORE ATTORNEYS ABSOLUTELY THE NUMBER OF INDIGENT CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE IN FACT MAJORITY PEOPLE OF COLOR MORE THAN 60% ACCORDING TO THE CENSUS. OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN POVERTY IN NEED A LAWYER ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND SO WE DO YOU DRASTICALLY NEED MORE ATTORNEYS OF COLOUR MORE DIVERSE ATTORNEYS TO BE SERVING AND ITCHING CALIFORNIANS THE THE STATISTICS I DON'T HAVE THE THE NUMBER BUT IT'S THOUSANDS. TO ONE OF ATTORNEYS. OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WHO NEED LAWYERS -- COMPARED TO THE NUMBER OF ATTORNEYS AVAILABLE TO SERVE THEM. NO QUESTION ABOUT IT IN THE RURAL COMMUNITIES AND IN THE INNER CITIES IN EVERY. AREA OF CALIFORNIA WHERE THERE UNDERSERVED UNDER REPRESENTED POPULATIONS THERE UNDERSERVED AND DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AT THE SAME RATIO THAT OTHERS DO. AND QUALIFIED LAWYERS ARE NEEDED TO SERVE ALL OF THEM WE DO NOT HAVE TOO MANY LAWYERS CALIFORNIA. IF IF I MAY ADD THAT THE AS THIS COULD AS THIS COMMITTEE HAS HAS RECOGNIZED. WE NEED TO GET GET TO PEOPLE OF COLOR PEOPLE OF UNDER UNDER REPRESENTED GROUPS INTO POSITIONS OF POWER. NOT JUST INTO THE PROFESSION BUT INTO POSITIONS OF POWER WITHIN THE WITHIN THAT PROFESSION SO THAT LIKE -- PRESIDING JUDGE BRAZIL WE CAN PROVIDE LEADERSHIP AND AND BECAUSE THE CHANGE THAT WE'RE ALL HOPING TO SEE IN THE PROFESSION. AND AND THE JUDGE WAS -- YOUR DESCRIPTION OF HOW YOU'RE CREATING THAT COMMITTEE FOR COMMISSIONERS AND ALL IS A CASE IN POINT NOT THAT ANOTHER. PRESIDING JUDGE WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING WRONG RIGHT BUT DIFFERENTLY. AND THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE MET RIGHT IN BECAUSE I'M THE PRESIDING JUDGE I PICK. SO. THEREFORE I CAN INSURE THERE'S DIVERSITY. AND I CAN TALK TO THE JUDGES WHO WERE PART OF THAT AGAIN IT GOES -- TO IMPLICIT BIAS THAT WE ALL HAVE. THAT THE COUNCIL IS WORKING ON WITH IN TERMS OF EDUCATION OF THE COURT TO DO THAT. BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE GET AWAY FROM WELL I ONLY PICK PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE ME OR WHO IS WITH WAS MENTIONED EARLIER WHO LOOK LIKE A JUDGE NOT SURE WHAT THAT IS. BUT FOR ME AND I LOOK AT IT BECAUSE I'M IN A POSITION TO PICK I CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND I WILL. RIGHT IN AND THE REASON I ASK A QUESTION ABOUT TOO MANY ATTORNEYS WAS I DON'T THINK WE DO AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT SUPPLY AND DEMAND IF WE HAD MORE TERMS IF WE HAD THOSE SIX TO EIGHT THOUSAND ATTORNEYS. MINORITY ATTORNEYS WHO. WERE PRACTICING BUT BECAUSE OF THAT THE CUT SCORE WE ALSO CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE RECIPROCITY WITH OTHER STATES. WE HOLD OURSELVES SORT OF ABOVE AND AND SEPARATE FROM. BUT THAT HAS A NARROW THE FIELD. AND I THINK IT THAT PUSHES THE THE TERM IS THAT WE HAVE TO WHAT THOSE HIGH PAYING JOBS IN THE BIG LAW FIRMS WHICH IS I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM FOR STARVING SOME OF THE RURAL AREAS THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT. SO FOR THE BAR IN FOR JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND THERE'S THERE'S INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE BAR THE JITTERS CANCELS RECORD HAS SOME OF THESE AUTHORITIES BUT BUT WHY NOT LOWER THE CUT SCORE AND WHY DON'T WE HAVE RECIPROCITY WITH OTHER STATES [inaudible] AND SO WE DID PROVIDE YOU KNOW THE BAR PROVIDED A STUDY DONE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE STANDARD SETTING STUDY I'M WHICH DID SHOW THAT IT PROVIDED THE SUPREME COURT WITH THE RANGE FROM. ONE THIRTY EIGHT TO ONE FORTY FOUR AM SHOWING THAT THAT WOULD SUPPORT MINIMUM COMPETENCY AND GAVE THOSE OPTIONS TO THE SUPREME COURT. AND SO IT'S TIME AT THAT TIME THERE WERE A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES GOING ON IS TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE COURT SAID COME BACK AND TALK TO THEM AGAIN. MY HOPE WOULD BE THAT THE CONVERSATION WE'VE HAD HERE TODAY HAVING JUSTICE LIEU HERE TODAY WAS. IMMENSELY VALUABLE -- I BELIEVE IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COURT TO OPEN THAT DISCUSSION AGAIN AND TO ASK FOR ADDITIONAL DATA THAT THE STATE BAR AS COMPILING DATA. OTHER. GROUPS WITHIN THE STATE OF COMPILING THE DATA WE NEED THE VENUE FOR THE DISCUSSION. AND IT IS NOT ONLY HERE IT IS AT THE CORE SO HOPEFULLY JUSTICE LOSE OPENING THAT DOOR FORCED TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION MORE BROADLY. AND AND AND THAT'S WHY I ASKED THE THE COURTS AS CHIEF JUSTICE REMINDS ME THAT SEPARATE KHOEKHOE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT ABSOLUTE YES WE HAVE SOME. INFLUENCE THERE I WOULD HOPE AS THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT. I THINK THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH AND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH ARE USED TO WORKING WITH EACH OTHER BUT NOT ALWAYS BETWEEN. THE JUDICIAL BRANCH AND THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH AND I AM HOPING AND HAVE HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH THE CHIEF JUSTICE THAT THAT WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB BETWEEN THE BRANCHES OF COMMUNICATING UNDERSTANDING. PROVIDING INFORMATION AND HELPING TO INFLUENCE EACH OTHER PROCREATE WITHIN THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. ON SOME OF THESE DECISION BUT I CAN'T SAY NO THE CHEAPEST IS GOING TO LISTEN AND SHE'S VERY ABSOLUTELY OPERATIVE. AND TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE. THE BAR GROUPS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS SHE HAS A VERY OPEN MIND. SO WE GOT THE RIGHT PERSON AT THE HELM TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN AND IS IRRITATING AS WE CAN BE YES I THINK THAT THAT MAKING SURE THAT THAT WE'RE BUILDING THOSE OPPORTUNITIES -- FOR THAT TYLER BUT I I JUST SPOKE MINOR POINT OR NOT A MINOR POINT BUT AT SMALL MENTION. JUDGE WOULD YOU MENTIONED THAT THE SECRET COMMITTEES THE JUDICIAL SELECTION ADVISORY COMMITTEES. WHICH HAVE BEEN A GREAT POINT OF CONSTERNATION. AND I THINK. SAM CRITICISM HAD BEEN LEVEL THAT -- AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE SURVEY RECENTLY BUT I THINK OVER TIME PROBABLY SOME TRUTH TO IT. THAT'D BE COMES A BIT OF A GOOD OLD BOYS CLUB AND I THINK WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THE RESULTS SINCE IT'S PART OF HOW. JUDICIAL DECISIONS WERE MADE APPOINTMENTS WERE MADE IT'S PART OF THAT VETTING TO SOME EXTENT. THAT. CENTS WERE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE US SAID AND I THINK IT POTENTIALLY PERPETUATED THAT SENSE OF GOOD OLD BOYS CLUB WHAT WHERE DOES THAT STAND HOW DOES THAT. A FACT THEN AGAIN WERE WEIGHING INTO SOMETHING THAT IS A AN EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE TO DO IS TO PICK JUDGES THAN AND WAYS THAT THAT. THE GOVERNOR WANTS TO BUT TRANSPARENCY. CONFIDENCE IN HOW THOSE DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE. TELL US ABOUT THAT AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND I UNDERSTAND THIS IS STILL. AN ISSUE BEING DISCUSSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THAT CERTAINLY THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THAT COMMITTEE THE WHAT THEY CALL THE CHASE ACTED JUDICIAL. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE A STANDS FOR BUT AT APPOINTMENTS SELECTION IS ELECTION ADVISORY. I KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT -- BUT BUT TO HOW THOSE OPERATING WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO BE SECRETIVE NOT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT IS THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THAT THERE'S BEEN I'VE HEARD SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT. IT'S NOT GONNA BE SECRET ANYMORE I'VE HEARD SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT PERHAPS IT'S IT'S STILL A MATTER DISCUSSION BUT I DO KNOW IT'S BEING DISCUSSED I ALSO KNOW. THAT JUSTICE JENKINS IS VERY VERY CONSCIOUS AS AS THE GOVERNOR OF MAKING SURE THAT WHAT EVER -- THE WAY THAT THAT COMMITTEE OPERATES IT IS GOING TO BE VERY DIVERSE IT'S GOING TO BE VERY CONNECTED TO THE VERY END TO THE VARIOUS -- ADD ADD THAT ALL OF THE GROUPS THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT HERE THAT THEY WILL BE PEOPLE WHO BE CONSCIOUS OF THESE ISSUES WHO ARE NOT GOING TO BE PART OF THE OLD BOYS CLUB. AND WHO ARE GOING TO BE -- GOING TO BE VERY AWARE OF EVERYBODY FROM THIS LEGISLATURE -- TO TO AT THE JUDICIARY'S CONCERNS IN THE BARS CONCERNS ABOUT MAKING FOR THE JUDICIARY IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE STATE SO I KNOW THAT'S VERY FIRST AND FOREMOST IN THE MIND OF THE GOVERNOR. AND IN THE MIND OF JUSTICE JENKINS AND I HAVE A FEELING THAT THAT IS GOING TO BE THAT'S GOING TO REFLECT. OF BE REFLECTED IN THE J. SEX IN THE FUTURE. GOOD. THANK YOU HAVE ACTUALLY THE INTEREST OF TIME I I DO WANT TO MOVE TO TO PUBLIC COMMENT BUT I VERY VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. THERE ARE MORE QUESTIONS YET. TO RAISE THAT I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUALLY DO THAT BUT I ALSO WHAT I'VE OFFERED IN FOR FOR YOU FOR THE PALACE AND FOR ANYBODY WHO IS WATCHING AND PAYING ATTENTION. WE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN IDEAS AND ACT IN IMPLEMENTATION AND I SAY THIS BEING A LEGISLATOR WHERE WE SOMETIMES ALL WE DO IS TALK. AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO STOP TALKING AND TAKE ACTION IN EMPLOYMENT AND AND WORK BETWEEN THE BRANCHES AND WITH THE VARIOUS AUTHORITIES ENSURE THAT WE'RE DOING THE BEST WE CAN. TO GET CHANGE ON THE GROUND AND GET THE LEGAL PROFESSION LOOKING LIKE CALIFORNIA DOES I THINK THAT THAT IF NOTHING ELSE THAT CASES WELL BEEN MADE HERE.

CONSERVE RE UP THE CAR THE THE COMMITTEE ROOM THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME A MOMENT TO SPEAK MY NAME IS COURTNEY GAMMA'S I'M AN IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY HERE IN SACRAMENTO -- IN LAW SCHOOL I HAD TO LEARN TO TEND TO TRUST MY INTUITION AND TRUST MYSELF -- I DIDN'T GET INTO THAT POSITION BY ACCIDENT I HAD WORKED MY WAY THERE I HAD EARNED MY POSITION THERE -- AND I LEARNED MANY LESSONS DURING MY TIME IN LAW SCHOOL. TELLING ME TO TRUST MYSELF IN TRUSTS MY EXPERIENCE -- MOSTLY WHEN MY SUPPORT A SUPERVISING ATTORNEY'S WERE WRONG AND I WAS CORRECT -- IN SECOND YEAR LAW SCHOOL I HELP TO WIN AN ASYLUM CASE FOR A WOMAN FROM NIGERIA -- AND IF I HAD TRUSTED MYSELF EARLY ON IT WOULD HAVE SAVED US MANY MANY HOURS OF WORK INSTEAD I TRUSTED THAT MY SUPERVISING ATTORNEY WAS CORRECT -- AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY FOUND OUT THAT -- I I I SHOULD HAVE GONE WITH MY GUT IN THE BEGINNING -- THE POINT OF I WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT TODAY IS I GRADUATED IN -- TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IT TOOK ME THREE TIMES TO PASS THE BAR EXAM -- IT WAS DEVASTATING AND CONFUSING FOR ME TOO I'M BEING TOLD I WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH TO BE AN ATTORNEY BUT GOING TO WORK STILL AND HAVING MY SUPERVISING ATTORNEY'S ASKING MY OPINION ON CASES -- WINNING CASES THAT MY ATTORNEYS HAD HAD THE NIGHT BEFORE -- AND IT'S STILL NOT BEING ABLE TO SAY I'M A TURN I'M AN ATTORNEY I'M GOOD ENOUGH TO BE AN ATTORNEY -- I WAS THE ONE ON THE FRONT LINES DOING THE RESEARCH AND MOST OF THE CASES THE ATTORNEYS FOR DOING IT. THE US STRATEGIZING I WAS THE ONE MAKING THE ARGUMENTS -- BUT I STILL COULDN'T BECAUSE OF THAT EXAM I WASN'T ABLE TO STAY RIGHT AWAY THAT I WAS AN ATTORNEY. I'M IN GOOD ENOUGH SO -- I ALSO WASN'T THE ONLY ONE THE IMMIGRATION LEGAL COMMUNITY HERE IN SACRAMENTO IS NOT VERY BIG AT ALL. AND WITHIN MY CLASS ALONE THERE WERE ALMOST TEN PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T PASSED THE BAR EXAM THE FIRST TIME AROUND THAT WE'RE GOING INTO IMMIGRATION -- AND THERE ARE MANY ACTUALLY THAT ARE STILL TRYING -- BECAUSE OF OUR STATE POPULATION DIVERSITY IS HUGELY IMPORTANT I'M NOT ONLY JUST FOR IMMIGRATION LAW BUT FOR ALL FIELDS OF LAW BECAUSE ALL OF MY CLIENTS HAVE OTHER LEGAL ISSUES IT'S NOT JUST IMMIGRATION THEY HAVE OTHER NEEDS. THAT AREN'T BEING TAKEN CARE OF ARE BEING REPRESENTED BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE DEDICATED TO THEIR ISSUES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO HELP THEM. I AM I PERSONALLY BECAME AN IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY BECAUSE I DEDICATED A LOT OF TIME TO LEARNING -- SPANISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE WHILE OTHER PEOPLE CAME FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS I JUST HAD A PERSONAL PASSION. I'M FOR IT. AND I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT -- THE BAR EXAM SCORING IT AND PASS IT RATES ARE DEVASTATING ON DIVERSITY AND ON THE I'M THE TYPE OF LAWYERS THAT ARE ENTERING THE COMMUNITY THE OTHER THAT ARE REPRESENTING. THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED US -- ENDS THE BAR EXAM AS IT IS -- IS PREVENTING US FROM BEING ABLE TO SERVE SUCH A HUGE POPULATION OF OUR OUR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M SELLING A COUPLE AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF LEGAL AID ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA AND I REPRESENT ROUGHLY ONE HUNDREDS OF LEGALLY NON PROFITS ARE ADVOCACY IN SACRAMENTO. AND I'VE TESTIFIED BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE FOR ON THE BAR EXAM CUT SCORES IN THE IMPACT ON CIVIL LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS. PARTICULARLY ON THE IMPACT ON RURAL LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS. I WILL BE BRIEF -- SO WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IS THAT CIVIL LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS DESPITE -- OUR LOW PAY WE ACTUALLY DID A MUCH BETTER JOB AT RECRUITING MORE DIVERSE ATTORNEYS AS CRISPIN ON BUYING SHARE EARLIER -- WE HAVE MORE WOMEN WE OUT NUMBER MEN TWO TO ONE IN CIVIL LEGAL NONPROFITS AND WE HAVE TWICE NUMBER OF LATINOS -- ATTORNEYS AS PRIVATE FIRMS -- MORE ASIAN AMERICAN ATTORNEYS AND NEARLY TWICE THE NUMBER OF AFRICAN AMERICAN ATTORNEYS. ARE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT IN RECRUITMENT OF OUR ISSUE OF COURSE IS RETENTION BECAUSE WE CANNOT COMPETE WITH THE PUBLIC SECTOR SALARIES -- WHAT WE WHAT WE DO IS WE RELY REALLY ON A DIVERSE PIPELINE OF NEW ATTORNEYS IN ORDER TO REPLACE THE FOLKS WERE LEAVING TO GO INTO GOVERNMENT WORK? OF THE STATE BAR DID OF A PREVIOUS SURVEY THAT SHOW THAT ACTUALLY A LARGE NUMBER OF CIVIL LEGAL AID ATTORNEYS WHEN THEY LEAVE LEGALLY THEY DON'T GO IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR THEY GO INTO GOVERNMENT WORK. SO WHAT WE DO IS WE TRAIN WE SUPPORT AND WE MENTOR BEFORE THEY MOVE ON AND THE HIGH COULD SCORE HAS A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON CIVIL LEGAL AID NON PROFITS. BECAUSE AS A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON ATTORNEYSOF COLOUR -- WOULDN'T BECAUSE WOMEN OUTNUMBER MEN IN BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE DIVERSE -- ATTORNEYS WITH THAT MEANS IS THAT OUR PIPELINE IS HURT AND ULTIMATELY HURTS THE CLIENTS THAT ARE SERVED BY CIVIL LEGAL AID NONPROFITS. THEY DESERVE TO RECEIVE SERVICES FROM ORGANIZATIONS THAT REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF THEIR COMMUNITIES -- IT JUST VERY BRIEFLY I KNOW CHRIS HAD MENTIONED THAT HE WASN'T SURE THE NUMBER OF LEGALLY CLIENTS ARE ELIGIBLE CLIENTS TO ATTORNEYS AND IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW WE'RE ROUGHLY. SEVEN THOUSAND ELIGIBLE PEOPLE PERCIVAL LEGAL AID ATTORNEY SO. AND WE WOULD LOVE TO INCREASE THE PIPELINE AND HAVE MORE DIVERSE LEGAL AID ATTORNEYS MORE DIVERSE ATTORNEYS THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- WHETHER IT'S AN IN SACRAMENTO IN LOS ANGELES OR LAKE COUNTY WE NEED MORE PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO REPRESENT LOW INCOME FOLKS. THANKS [inaudible] THANK YOU.HELLO MY NAME IS DANNY MANNING AND I WAS -- FORMALLY CHIEF OF THE SENATE SERGEANT ARMS HERE AT THE CAPITOL AND RETIRED AFTER THIRTY FOUR YEARS HERE -- I'M ON MY RETIREMENT AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE APPOINTED ME TO THE STATE BAR.

MY POSITION THEY'RE VERY -- I FEEL IS RELEASED INTO A DUTY TO REPRESENT. PEOPLE OF COLOR AND PEOPLE LOW INCOME BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE I COME FROM AS A PUBLIC MEMBER THAT'S WHAT I REPRESENT AND I THINK THAT I AM I HAVE A VOICE FOR THAT. I THINK THE BAR SINCE I'VE BEEN THERE FOR ONLY A YEAR. AND I DON'T KNOW ALL THE OTHER STUFF THAT. WENT ON FOR YEARS BEFORE. IS REALLY IN A GOOD PLACE NOW AS TO WHAT IT IS WE'RE DOING THE REALLY THINK LIKE THE DATA COLLECTION AND FINDING OUT WHERE THE PROBLEMS ARE WHERE THE NEEDS ARE. AND THEN ADDRESSING THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT -- THAT WE TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY INCLUSION OF THE STATE BAR AND FOR US IN A PARTICULAR WE HAD A A BIG MEETING ON IT IN ON JANUARY. IS THAT WE'RE NOT JUST SAYING THE WORDS IS NOT JUST FOR SAYING THE WORD TO SOMETHING THAT'S BECOME A CORE VALUE FOR US.

CHAIRMAN AND TO YOUR STAFF -- AND TO EVERYONE WHO CONVENE THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME STE JUDGE YVONNE COMPOST AND I'M FROM THE SAN DIEGO SUPERIOR COURT -- I PAID MY WAY TO COME UP TODAY BECAUSE I CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THIS ISSUE BOTH FOR THE PROFESSION AND FOR THE JUDICIARY. I'M A GRAY DAVIS APPOINTEE. AND I'M A NATIVE CALIFORNIAN. I WOULDN'T BE IN THE LEGAL POSITION THAT I'M IN AS A JURIST OR AS HAVING BEEN -- IN BIG LONG OR AS A FEDERAL PROSECUTOR HAD IT NOT BEEN. FOR CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC EDUCATION I'M A PRODUCT OF WILLARD ELEMENTARY IN ROSEMEAD CALIFORNIA. BACK WHEN CALIFORNIA INVESTED IN ITS PEOPLE BACK WHEN CALIFORNIA HAD GIFTED AND TALENTED PROGRAMS THAT TOLD KIDS HEY YOU'RE SMART YOU CAN BE SOMEBODY. AND I FEAR THAT IN THE DESTRUCTION OF OUR STATE WIDE PUBLIC EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM WE'VE LOST PEOPLE THAT COULD BE LIKE ME THAT ARE THAT ARE OTHERWISE OUT THERE. I SENT MY KIDS TO LOCAL K. THROUGH -- SIX PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THEY HAD AN EXCELLENT TIME WHEN THE BUDGET CRISIS HIT I HAD TO SEND THEM TO PRIVATE SCHOOL SO THEY COULD GET QUALITY EDUCATIONS. AND SO. I THINK THAT THIS IS BEEN FANTASTIC I APPLAUD YOU I THANK YOU -- BUT ALSO PLEASE KNOW THAT AS A JURIST FOR ALMOST SIXTEEN YEARS. THERE IS A WIDE SPREAD OF REALLY BAD LAWYERS OUT THERE. AND I URGE YOU -- TO LOOK AT THE TOTALITY OF WHAT WOULD GO INTO THE CUT SCORE I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT SOLD I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING AGAINST IT SO I JUST ASK THAT YOU HAVE A FULLY INFORMED. CONSIDERATION BECAUSE PASSING THE BAR DOES NOT MAKE YOU A COMPETENT LAWYER AND I'VE SEEN PLENTY OF INCOMPETENT LAWYERS. AND I WORRY ABOUT THE PEOPLE THE STATE BEING SUBJECT SUBJECTED TO MORE INCOMPETENT LAWYERING -- AND SO WITH THAT I THINK YOU AND I'LL SEND AN ADDITIONAL WRITTEN COMMENTS [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SOPHIA CREEL AND THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN STANFORD LAW GRADUATE. AND I AM A JUDICIAL LAW CLERK AT THE FEDERAL COURT -- I WANTED TO SPEAK BECAUSE I'M A PRODUCT. OF DIVERSITY PIPELINE NAY AND JUSTICE I GREW UP IN IMPERIAL COUNTY. I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL THAT HAD ABOUT A 30% DROP OUT RATE. FROM STANFORD LAW GRAD AND I'M A LAW CLERK AT THE FEDERAL COURT THE ONLY LATINO LOCKER THERE. ON I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT I APPLIED THAT. YOU'RE HAVING THESE DISCUSSIONS BY ONE ENCOURAGE YOU TO BE BULL. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT PIPELINE INITIATIVE. THERE WERE TWO PROGRAMS THAT HAD ENORMOUS AFFECT MY ABILITY TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL. BOTH OF THEM HAPPENED WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL. THE FIRST WAS PARTICIPATION IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT FOUNDATIONS MOCK TRIAL PROGRAM. IT'S ACTIVE IN ALL CALIFORNIA COUNTIES I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU LOOK INTO HOW YOU CAN PARTNER WITH THEM OR HOW YOU CAN PARTNER WITH OTHER INITIATIVES. I SAY THAT THAT HAD THE BIGGEST IMPACT BECAUSE NOT ONLY DID A GETTING ON A PATH TO SING MYSELF AS A LAWYER MY PATH TO LAW SCHOOL. THEY GOT ME TO A PATH OF COLLEGE READINESS THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD IN MY HIGH SCHOOL THEY DID NOT HAVE. ACADEMIC PROGRAMMING THAT WAS COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOLS. THE SECOND WAS IS THE FIRST TIME I'D EVER MADE AWARE. WAS THROUGH THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS PROGRAM THE MOCK TRIAL PROGRAM. AND THROUGH THEIR PROGRAM WITH UCLA HAVING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS GO TO UCLA TO SEE THEMSELVES IN PRE Là PROGRAMMING IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD EVER MET A LAWYER. THERE I LOOK BACK AT MY EXPERIENCES AND I TELL PEOPLE THAT I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF PURPOSE. IN LAW SCHOOL I WAS ABLE TO HELP -- COCHAIR A CASE WHERE WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING OUR CLIENT ASYLUM. I SERVED WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN IMMIGRATION DETENTION AND ROLL TEXAS. I WANT TO GO BACK TO MY COMMUNITY AND IMPERIAL COUNTY AND CONTINUE TO SERVE. I STOOD UP IN LAW SCHOOL IN OVER TWENTY STATE CASES. I'M READY TO BE A LITIGATOR. I FIND OUT FRIDAY FIVE PASSED FOR THE FINGERS CROSSED. BUT BUT I WANTED TO HAVE MY VOICE HEARD BECAUSE I I WANT TO IMPLORE YOU WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE AND WHEN I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE. MENTORS EXTEND A HAND TO PROGRAMS TELL ME YOU CAN GO TO LAW SCHOOL EVEN WHEN I COULDN'T SEE COLLEGE ON THE HORIZON. THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE. IT'S EASY TO GLANCE OVER THE K. THROUGH TWELVE PIPELINE PROGRAMMING AND SAY. HOW MUCH DIFFERENCE CAN REALLY BE MADE I'M TELLING YOU? AS A STAND FOR LAW GRADUATE. I CREDIT THOSE PROGRAMS FOR PUTTING ME ON THE SPOT. THE OTHER ISSUE I WANTED TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION IS EMPOWERING OTHERS WHO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF PURPOSE LIKE ME. TO ACTUALLY SIR. I KNOW THAT. IT'S DIFFICULT TO BALANCE DIFFERENT THINGS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS -- WITH WHEN IT COMES TO THE BAR EXAM SCORING. BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT MY COMMUNITY. I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT PASSIONATE LAWYERS WHO WANT TO HELP THEM. I'M WORRIED THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE WERE READY TO GO DOWN AND SERVE THOSE RURAL COMMUNITIES SO BE BOLTS. THERE ARE OTHER WAYS BESIDES THE CUT SCORE. WHICH I'M NOT SAYING IT'S A GOOD OR BAD IDEA. THAT CAN BE EMPLOYED FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'VE TAKEN THE CALIFORNIA BAR YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT SUBJECTS AS WELL AS THE ANTI THAT YOU NEED TO BE PREPARED. FOR WHY NOT GIVE US SIX ESSAYS ONLY FIVE OR SCORED. AND GIVE THE CHOICE OF WHICH FIVE TO TAKE. WHY NOT EXCEPT IN THESE SCORES THAT ARE PASSING FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS? AND FOR FOLKS WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY OVER THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EVERY TIME YOU TAKE A TEST. THAT'S THREE MONTHS. NOT WORKING PLUS THE BAR EXAM FEES. WHY DON'T YOU HONOR IF THEY HAD A PASSING IN THE SCORE FROM A PREVIOUS TEST? AND HAVE THEM SIT. ESSENTIALLY FOR THE ATTORNEYS EXAM THAT WOULD TEST THE EIGHTEEN SUBJECTS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AGAIN PLEASE BE ABLE AS YOU LOOK AT PIPELINE PROGRAMS AND AS YOU LOOK AT WAYS. TO EMPOWER THOSE WHO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF PURPOSE TO ACTUALLY GO INTO OUR COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. WHEN YOU PASSED THE BAR THEY WERE GOING TO PUT YOU IN CHARGE? GOOD AFTERNOON REBEKAH MARCUS REPRESENTING THE CENTER FOR PUBLIC AND INTEREST LAW. STEVE HI AL AB SUPPORTS THE RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE BAR EXAM REFORM AND THE TRANSPARENCY RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE APPOINTMENTS TO THE JUDICIARY WE BELIEVE THAT POLICYMAKERS ARE IN PARTICULAR -- NEED OF DATA GATHERING SO THAT WE CAN FURTHER UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF CALIFORNIA'S EXTREMELY HIGH CUT SCORE ON NOT ONLY THE DIVERSITY OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION BUT ALSO THE JUSTICE GAP IN GENERAL WE ENCOURAGE ALLEGE THE LEGISLATURE TO SUPPORT SUCH A STUDY. AND DATA GATHERING THAT WOULD BOLSTER THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU ARE CONSIDERING TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PARTICIPATING. AND THIS IS. CLEARLY SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA BE CONTINUING TO WORK ON THERE'S A ROLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE THERE'S A ROLE FOR THE SUPREME COURT. ROLE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION HERE AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF WORKING TOGETHER AND MAKING SURE WE'RE ESTABLISHING APPROPRIATE STANDARDS. THE BAR EXAM DOES NOT ASSURE COMPETENT ATTORNEYS AND THE THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS VERY CLEAR. BUT THAT'S THE ROLE OF THE STATE BAR TO ASSURE COP INTERNEES THE ROLE THE STATE BAR'S PUBLIC PROTECTION [inaudible] AND THE BAR EXAM IS MERELY AN INDICATION OF MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR BEING ABLE TO PRACTICE LAW. BUT ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS COMPENSATE CONSIDERATIONS THOSE CERTAINLY DEVELOP OVER TIME I THINK THE HISTORY OF THE PRACTICE. SHOWS AND THOSE ARE VERY CRITICAL COMPONENTS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE SERIOUSLY WITH RESPECT OF PROTECTING THE PUBLIC ENSURING. THAT. CONSUMERS HAVE ACCESS TO COMPETENCY INNARDS. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK BACK INTO THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN TAKING. SERIOUSLY INVESTING IN APPROPRIATE EDUCATION LOOKING AT THE EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS ENSURING THAT ALL KIDS HAVE ACCESS. TO QUALITY EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO OPPORTUNITIES AND HIGHER EDUCATION SHOULD THEY SO DESIRE AND THAT I'M HOPING WILL INCLUDE. THE LEGAL PROFESSION AS ONE OF THOSE PATHWAYS SO WE CLEARLY HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. I APPRECIATE THE PANELISTS FOR BEING WILLING TO COME FORWARD AND GIVE US THE BENEFIT OF YOUR WISDOM. I THINK WE HAVE RAISED A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT STILL HAVE YET TO BE ANSWERED AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION. THIS IS SOMETHING I KNOW THAT A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE ALSO VERY INTERESTED IN SO THEIR LACK OF PRESENCE ON THE DISS NOT INDICATION OF LACK OF INTEREST. BUT MERELY THIS TIME OF YEAR I SUPPOSE SO I THANK EVERYBODY FOR BEING HERE. WE'RE GONNA BECAUSE DATE ON THIS I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS AND FINDING A REAL SOLUTIONS TO DIVERSITY ON THE BAR. AND WITH THAT THIS COMMITTEE THIS. INFORMATIONAL HEARING IS ADJOURNED
