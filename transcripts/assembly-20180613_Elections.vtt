STEINORTH.

00:40:52.683 --> 00:40:53.551
SO I I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS

00:40:53.617 --> 00:40:54.685
ABOUT PROVISIONAL BALLOTS IN

00:40:54.752 --> 00:40:55.886
GENERAL JUST BECAUSE IT IS KIND

00:40:55.953 --> 00:40:57.188
OF ONE OF THOSE AREAS WITHIN THE

00:40:57.254 --> 00:40:58.656
ELECTIONS CODE THAT'S KIND OF

00:40:58.722 --> 00:41:00.291
DARK. IT'S NOT A LOT OF LANGUAGE

00:41:00.357 --> 00:41:01.425
AND PROVISIONAL BALLOTS AND SO

00:41:01.492 --> 00:41:02.626
IT'S LEFT UP TO THE FIFTY EIGHT

00:41:02.693 --> 00:41:03.961
COUNTIES TO DETERMINE HOW

00:41:04.028 --> 00:41:04.962
THEY'RE GOING TO PROCESS THEM

00:41:05.029 --> 00:41:06.664

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:08.098
DECISION MAKERS. ON HOW

00:41:08.165 --> 00:41:09.099
PROVISIONAL BALLOTS ARE BEING

00:41:09.166 --> 00:41:10.501
CAST BECAUSE OUR ELECTIONS CODE

00:41:10.568 --> 00:41:12.670
IS SILENT MEANS I I THINK THAT'S

00:41:12.736 --> 00:41:14.271
A GREAT PLACE TO START. MAYBE TO

00:41:14.338 --> 00:41:15.706
START ACTUALLY PUTTING THE SAME

00:41:15.773 --> 00:41:17.007
VOTE BY MAIL PROVISIONAL

00:41:17.074 --> 00:41:18.576
RESTRICTIONS ON PROVISIONAL

00:41:18.642 --> 00:41:20.110
BALLOT BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU MY

00:41:20.177 --> 00:41:21.579
SIXTEEN RACE THERE WERE NINE

00:41:21.645 --> 00:41:23.447
PERCENT OF THE OVERALL ABOUT

00:41:23.514 --> 00:41:24.982
BALLOTS CAST WERE PROVISIONAL

00:41:25.049 --> 00:41:26.617
THIRTEEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED

00:41:26.684 --> 00:41:27.618
AND NINETY EIGHT.

00:41:27.685 --> 00:41:28.385
AND MAJORITY OF THEM WERE

00:41:28.452 --> 00:41:29.620
FRAUDULENT

00:41:29.687 --> 00:41:30.955
THE MAJORITY WERE THROWN OUT

00:41:31.021 --> 00:41:32.223
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THEY SPEND

00:41:32.289 --> 00:41:33.958
TWENTY ONE DAYS PROCESSING THEM

00:41:34.024 --> 00:41:34.792
THEY CAN COME UP WITH A

00:41:34.859 --> 00:41:36.460
LEGITIMATE REASON TO ACTUALLY

00:41:36.527 --> 00:41:38.162
MAKE JUSTIFICATION. THEY WERE

00:41:38.229 --> 00:41:39.463

00:41:41.966 --> 00:41:43.500
WAS JUST A MATTER OF HOW DO WE

00:41:43.567 --> 00:41:44.835
COUNTIES VOTE. AS BEST AS

00:41:44.902 --> 00:41:46.270
POSSIBLE WITH SAME DAY

00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:48.505
REGISTRATION AND THE FACT THAT

00:41:48.572 --> 00:41:49.707
WE DO KNOW THAT THERE IS FRAUD

00:41:49.773 --> 00:41:50.708
IN THE PROVISIONAL BALLOTING

00:41:50.774 --> 00:41:52.376
SYSTEM WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD WE

00:41:52.443 --> 00:41:53.177
WANT TO TRY AND MERGE THEM

00:41:53.244 --> 00:41:54.511
TOGETHER BECAUSE. TRADITIONALLY

00:41:54.578 --> 00:41:55.980
PROVISIONAL BALLOTS INTENDED FOR

00:41:56.046 --> 00:41:57.581
TWO PURPOSES.

00:41:57.648 --> 00:41:59.283
I GOT MY VOTE BY MAIL I FORGOT

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:01.518
IT I WANNA GO VOTE I'D AND BRING

00:42:01.585 --> 00:42:03.087
IT WITH ME I GET A PROVISIONAL.

00:42:03.153 --> 00:42:04.688
I GO INTO A POLLING PLACE

00:42:04.755 --> 00:42:06.390
BECAUSE I'M NEAR WORK MY WORK IS

00:42:06.457 --> 00:42:07.591
NOT WHERE I WHERE I LIVE I'M

00:42:07.658 --> 00:42:10.060
RUNNING LATE I WANNA GO VOTE BY

00:42:10.127 --> 00:42:11.729
SHOW WEAPON I SAY HEY. I'M NOT

00:42:11.795 --> 00:42:13.130
ACTUALLY REGISTERED HERE I'M

00:42:13.197 --> 00:42:14.298
REGISTERED IT A DIFFERENT

00:42:14.365 --> 00:42:16.166
POLLING PLACE I'D LIKE TO VOTE

00:42:16.233 --> 00:42:17.234
PROVISIONALLY.

00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:18.535
THOSE ARE USUALLY THE TWO

00:42:18.602 --> 00:42:19.169
REASONS THAT PEOPLE WOULD VOTE

00:42:19.236 --> 00:42:21.005
PROVISIONALLY SO IN THE CASE

00:42:21.071 --> 00:42:22.172
WHERE YOU HAVE SAME DAY VOTER

00:42:22.239 --> 00:42:23.707
REGISTRATION WHY WOULD WE NEED

00:42:23.774 --> 00:42:25.376
THIS OVERLAPPING WHEN WE SEE

00:42:25.442 --> 00:42:27.678
THAT IN MY EXAMPLE SPECIFICALLY.

00:42:27.745 --> 00:42:28.746
NINE PERCENT OF THE VOTES THAT

00:42:28.812 --> 00:42:30.114
WERE CAST

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:31.348
HALF OF THEM WERE THROWN OUT IS

00:42:31.415 --> 00:42:34.051
JUST COMPLETELY FRIED.

00:42:34.118 --> 00:42:35.920
I MEAN I I THINK IT'S A BIGGER

00:42:35.986 --> 00:42:37.388
PUBLIC POLICY QUESTION THAT.

00:42:37.454 --> 00:42:40.658
ISN'T IS A VALID DEBATE I I

00:42:40.724 --> 00:42:42.860
DON'T I THINK.

00:42:42.927 --> 00:42:44.528
YOU MAY VIEW THE SYSTEM IS IN

00:42:44.595 --> 00:42:45.362
PERFECT OR.

00:42:45.429 --> 00:42:47.298
FLAWED AT THIS POINT I DON'T

00:42:47.364 --> 00:42:49.133
THINK THIS COMPOUNDS THE PROBLEM

00:42:49.199 --> 00:42:50.834
IF ANYTHING I IT YOU KNOW FOR

00:42:50.901 --> 00:42:52.503
WHAT YOU SEE IT AS.

00:42:52.569 --> 00:42:54.805
I THINK IT ACTUALLY.

00:42:54.872 --> 00:42:57.641
WOULD RESULT IN IN LES MIS A

00:42:57.708 --> 00:42:59.576
MISS COUNTS OR LESS

00:42:59.643 --> 00:43:01.078
ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AT THAT

00:43:01.145 --> 00:43:03.747
POINT A OF OF PROCESSING BECAUSE

00:43:03.814 --> 00:43:05.115
YOU DON'T HAVE AS MANY FORMS

00:43:05.182 --> 00:43:06.517
FLYING AROUND BECAUSE. AT THIS

00:43:06.583 --> 00:43:08.052
POINT THIRD SORT TWO SETS OF

00:43:08.118 --> 00:43:10.087
PAPER COMING IN AT ALL SO WHEN

00:43:10.154 --> 00:43:10.854
THEY HAD TO GO THROUGH AND

00:43:10.921 --> 00:43:12.256
RECOUNT YEARS THERE AND THEY

00:43:12.323 --> 00:43:14.158
WERE TRYING TO MATCH THAT. TO

00:43:14.224 --> 00:43:16.193
THE REGISTRATION FILE RIGHT IN

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:17.795
HERE.

00:43:17.861 --> 00:43:18.362
MISTAKEN IN ONE PLACE SO IF

00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:19.630
ANYTHING.

00:43:19.697 --> 00:43:20.898
THAT NINE PERCENT OR WHATEVER

00:43:20.965 --> 00:43:22.399
MAY HAVE BEEN.

00:43:22.466 --> 00:43:24.001
IN IN PURE WOULD BE EASIER TO

00:43:24.068 --> 00:43:26.570
GET TO I GUESS IS HOW I SEE THIS

00:43:26.637 --> 00:43:28.072
NAM SO MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IS

00:43:28.138 --> 00:43:29.773
THIS WOULD BE IN LIEU UP SO

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.542
INSTEAD OF PEOPLE SHOWING UP AND

00:43:31.608 --> 00:43:32.810
DOING SAME DAY REGISTRATION.

00:43:32.876 --> 00:43:33.544
THEY WOULD FILL OUT A

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:34.745
PROVISIONAL THE PROVISIONAL

00:43:34.812 --> 00:43:36.146
WOULD ACT OUT YOUR SAME DAY

00:43:36.213 --> 00:43:37.181
REGISTRATION SO THE SAME DAY

00:43:37.247 --> 00:43:38.949
REGISTRATION GOES AWAY

00:43:39.016 --> 00:43:40.751
PROVISIONAL TAKES ITS PLACE.

00:43:40.818 --> 00:43:43.020
PROVISIONAL TAKES

00:43:43.087 --> 00:43:43.721
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE SAYING THAT IS

00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:44.722
TO CUT BACK ON THE AMOUNT OF

00:43:44.788 --> 00:43:46.290
PAPERWORK THIS ACTUALLY DOES THE

00:43:46.357 --> 00:43:48.025
OPPOSITE IF IF YOU ARE

00:43:48.092 --> 00:43:49.360
ELIMINATING SAME DAY

00:43:49.426 --> 00:43:50.794
REGISTRATION AND REPLACING A

00:43:50.861 --> 00:43:52.396
PROVISIONAL THAT AXIS SAME DAY

00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:54.465
REGISTRATION. THAT DOES

00:43:54.531 --> 00:43:56.233
ELIMINATE ONE ELEMENT BUT IF

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:57.301
YOU'RE GONNA CONTINUOUS SAME DAY

00:43:57.368 --> 00:43:59.103
REGISTRATION AND THEN ALSO HAVE

00:43:59.169 --> 00:44:00.804
THEM VOTE PROVISIONAL BECAUSE

00:44:00.871 --> 00:44:02.206
THAT'S WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED IF

00:44:02.272 --> 00:44:02.706
YOU'RE DOING A SAME DAY

00:44:02.773 --> 00:44:03.974
REGISTRATION YOU WOULD THEN HAVE

00:44:04.041 --> 00:44:05.743
TO CAST A PROVISIONAL BALLOTS IN

00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:07.344
TIME. YOU WOULD HAVE DUPLICATION

00:44:07.411 --> 00:44:08.912
AT THAT POINT NOW WHAT HAPPENS

00:44:08.979 --> 00:44:10.748
THEN IF YOU'RE AUTOMATICALLY

00:44:10.814 --> 00:44:13.117

CASE MAY BE. YOU FILL OUT A

00:44:16.887 --> 00:44:17.955
PROVISIONAL NOW ARE YOU

00:44:18.022 --> 00:44:19.356
DUPLICATING THE EFFORTS AT THE

00:44:19.423 --> 00:44:20.357
RV BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO

00:44:20.424 --> 00:44:21.325
THINK THAT THIS HAS TO BE SAME

00:44:21.392 --> 00:44:22.226
DAY REGISTRATION HOW ARE THEY

00:44:22.292 --> 00:44:23.827

AFTERWARDS SO THERE'S AND I KNOW.

00:47:27.144 --> 00:47:29.213
AND AND I'VE JUST.

00:47:29.279 --> 00:47:30.447
AND A NOTABLY HERE IMPOSTER

00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:31.882
COUNTY WE DON'T DO THAT BECAUSE

00:47:31.949 --> 00:47:32.883
WE HAVE THE VOTER COMPLETED

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:34.384
VOTER REGISTRATION CARD WHEN

00:47:34.451 --> 00:47:35.319
THEY'RE THERE.

00:47:35.385 --> 00:47:37.921
IF THEY NEED TO FOR IT IF THEY

00:47:37.988 --> 00:47:39.323
COME IN FOR PROVISIONAL.

00:47:39.389 --> 00:47:40.824
VOTING EXPERIENCE.

00:47:40.891 --> 00:47:42.326
MOST THE TIME IF WE CAN SEE THAT

00:47:42.392 --> 00:47:43.927
THE PERSON WAS ISSUED ABOUT

00:47:43.994 --> 00:47:45.495

LOT OF VOTER REGISTRATION CARD

00:47:50.734 --> 00:47:52.970
SO THAT I THINK THAT THE

00:47:53.036 --> 00:47:54.238
STREAMLINING OF THE PROCESS.

00:47:54.304 --> 00:47:55.739
YOU'RE YOU'RE ENVISIONING A

00:47:55.806 --> 00:47:57.174
PROCESS THAT REQUIRES MORE

00:47:57.241 --> 00:48:00.744
PAPERWORK AND I THINK THAT GUY.

00:48:00.811 --> 00:48:02.379
YOU'RE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

00:48:02.446 --> 00:48:04.381
IS A A PROCESS THAT REQUIRES

00:48:04.448 --> 00:48:06.450
LESS PAPERWORK BUT SEAT REALLY.

00:48:06.516 --> 00:48:07.651
BUT I APPRECIATE ON INTO MY

00:48:07.718 --> 00:48:08.952
CONCERN IS AND I THINK WE ARE

00:48:09.019 --> 00:48:09.987
KIND OF TALKING AROUND EACH

00:48:10.053 --> 00:48:11.488
OTHER IS OKAY SO IF THE

00:48:11.555 --> 00:48:13.223
TRADITIONAL AND BALK OF

CATEGORIES WE BOTH AGREED ON.

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.028

00:48:20.664 --> 00:48:21.665
DIFFERENT PRECINCT.

00:48:21.732 --> 00:48:22.799
WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD WE NEED

00:48:24.368 --> 00:48:25.636

YOU'RE ATTEMPTING TO DO MY

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:41.945
CONCERN IS IS WHEN WE ACTUALLY

WORTH OF TRAINING TO BE ABLE TO

00:49:58.095 --> 00:49:59.329
MAKE THIS DETERMINATION WHEN

THEY'RE GOING THROUGH AND

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:01.331
PROCESSING PROVISIONAL BALLOTS

00:50:01.398 --> 00:50:02.499
IF YOU'VE EVER GONE THROUGH THAT

I'M SURE YOU HAVE. THAT YOU'VE

00:50:03.734 --> 00:50:04.835
EVER SAT THERE I STOOD THERE FOR

TWENTY ONE DAYS AND WATCHED AS

THEY GO THROUGH WHEN THEY JUST

00:50:08.305 --> 00:50:09.706
BASICALLY HAVE OF SOMEONE

00:50:09.773 --> 00:50:10.607
TRAINED WITH FORTY FIVE MINUTES

00:50:10.674 --> 00:50:12.008
WORTH OF EXPERIENCE MAKING

00:50:12.075 --> 00:50:13.777
TERMINATION COUNT DON'T COUNT.

FOUR DIFFERENT TIMES DEPENDING

00:50:16.546 --> 00:50:17.781

00:50:17.848 --> 00:50:19.816
INDIVIDUAL ROV. BUT THAT'S MY

00:50:19.883 --> 00:50:20.817
POINT YOU HAVE FIFTY EIGHT

FOR AN RV TO PROCESS ACCURATELY

00:50:28.158 --> 00:50:29.760
AND THEN ADDED THAT EXTRA

00:50:29.826 --> 00:50:30.761

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:34.998
PUTTING A LITTLE MORE BURDEN

00:50:35.065 --> 00:50:36.099
THAN KEEPING IT STREAMLINED ON A
