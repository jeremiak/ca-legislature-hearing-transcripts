ZONING.

00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:20.753

PROHIBITING ALL FORMS OF HOUSING.

OTHER THAN SINGLE FAMILY HOMES.

00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:39.972
MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.809

00:05:58.157 --> 00:06:00.159

00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:13.573
IT DOES SO BY LEGALIZING SMALL

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:42.722
LAND USE.

00:08:42.788 --> 00:08:44.290
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE.

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:46.292
AS I JUST DESCRIBED SB FIFTY

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:48.261
RETAINS ENORMOUS LOCAL DECISION

00:08:48.327 --> 00:08:49.161
MAKING.

00:08:49.228 --> 00:08:51.497
BUT IN ONE AREA OF STATEWIDE

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:54.033
IMPORTANCE DENSITY NEAR PUBLIC

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.668
TRANSPORTATION AND JOBS.

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:59.171
IT SETS A BASIC STANDARD.

00:08:59.238 --> 00:09:00.306
OTHERS HAVE CLAIMED THAT SB

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:01.941
FIFTY IS AN ATTACK ON SINGLE

00:09:02.008 --> 00:09:03.209
FAMILY HOMES.

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:05.611
THAT IS ALSO INACCURATE.

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:07.914
NOTHING IN SENATE BILL FIFTY

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.216
PREVENTS ANYONE FROM BUILDING OR

00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:13.152
LIVING AND A SINGLE FAMILY HOME.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:15.087
SINGLE FAMILY HOMES.

00:09:15.154 --> 00:09:17.523
IN MY VIEW OR A GOOD THING.

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:18.925
BUT SO OUR APARTMENT BUILDINGS.

00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:20.426
SB FIFTY ALLOWS SINGLE FAMILY

00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:22.461
HOMES.

00:09:22.528 --> 00:09:23.963
BUT IT MOVES US AWAY FROM

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.565
MANDATING THAT SINGLE FAMILY

00:09:26.632 --> 00:09:28.000
HOMES ARE THE ONLY THING.

00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:30.703
FEDERAL OUT TO BE BUILT -- NEAR

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:32.371
TRANSIT OUR JOBS YOU SHOULD BE

00:09:32.438 --> 00:09:35.074
ABLE TO BUILD VARIOUS KINDS OF

00:09:35.141 --> 00:09:37.476
HOUSING NOT JUST ONE TYPE.

00:09:37.543 --> 00:09:39.812
SO WHY FOCUS ON ZONING DENSITY

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:41.847
NEAR TRANSCEND JOBS.

00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:43.349
WALL ZONING ISN'T THE ONLY

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:45.151
IMPEDIMENT. TO CALIFORNIA MEDIAN

00:09:45.217 --> 00:09:47.586
HOUSING NEEDS WE ALSO NEED

00:09:47.653 --> 00:09:48.888
FINANCIAL INVESTMENT IN

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:50.056
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

00:09:50.122 --> 00:09:51.624
WE NEED STRONGER TENANT

00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:52.692
PROTECTIONS.

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:54.527
WE NEED FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO

00:09:54.593 --> 00:09:56.362
HELP CITIES ENGAGE IN GOOD

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:58.097
PLANNING AND SO FORTH.

00:09:58.164 --> 00:10:00.599
ZONING IS FOUNDATIONAL.

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:02.635
YOU CAN UP ALL OF THE INVESTMENT

00:10:02.702 --> 00:10:05.471
AND STREAMLINING IN THE WORLD.

00:10:05.538 --> 00:10:07.239
BUT IF IT'S A LEGAL IF IT IS

00:10:07.306 --> 00:10:08.474
PROHIBITED TO BUILD ENOUGH

00:10:08.541 --> 00:10:10.309
HOUSING.

00:10:10.376 --> 00:10:12.712
THEN YOU'RE SORT OF STOCK.

00:10:12.778 --> 00:10:15.281
AND 80% APPROXIMATELY OF THE

00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:16.582
RESIDENTIAL LEASE ON LAND IN

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:19.418
CALIFORNIA AND ABOUT 70% EVEN IN

00:10:19.485 --> 00:10:21.087
BIG CITIES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO

00:10:21.153 --> 00:10:22.455
AND LOS ANGELES.

00:10:22.521 --> 00:10:24.390
IT IS ILLEGAL TO BUILD ANYTHING

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:26.525
OTHER THAN A SINGLE FAMILY HOME

00:10:26.592 --> 00:10:28.294
OR MAYBE A TWO UNIT BUILDING.

00:10:28.361 --> 00:10:29.662
THAT MANS IT'S ILLEGAL TO BUILD

00:10:29.729 --> 00:10:31.797
EVEN A THREE FOUR FIVE OR SIX

00:10:31.864 --> 00:10:33.632
UNIT SMALL APARTMENT BUILDING

00:10:33.699 --> 00:10:35.501
ILLEGAL IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF

00:10:35.568 --> 00:10:36.836
CALIFORNIA.

00:10:36.902 --> 00:10:39.005
THAT MEANS IT'S ILLEGAL TO BUILD

00:10:39.071 --> 00:10:40.906
MULTI UNIT SENIOR HOUSING.

00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:42.842
ILLEGAL TO BUILD AFFORDABLE

00:10:42.908 --> 00:10:45.311
HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS

00:10:45.378 --> 00:10:46.545
BECAUSE THAT IS INHERENTLY MULTI

00:10:46.612 --> 00:10:49.281
UNIT.

00:10:49.348 --> 00:10:51.050
AND WHAT DOES THIS RESTRICTIVE

00:10:51.117 --> 00:10:52.785
ZONING MEAN FOR CALIFORNIA.

00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:55.121
THAT MAKES IT ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE

00:10:55.187 --> 00:10:57.156
TO CLOSE OUR THREE POINT FIVE

00:10:57.223 --> 00:10:58.557
MILLION HOME DEFICIT.

00:10:58.624 --> 00:11:00.693
IT'S BASIC MATH.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.094
IF YOU SAY THAT YOU CAN ONLY

00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:04.263
BUILD ONE UNIT PER PARCEL IN THE

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.765
VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA.

00:11:05.831 --> 00:11:07.133
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO MEET YOUR

00:11:07.199 --> 00:11:09.702
HOUSING GOALS AD IF YOU DO.

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:10.336
YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT BY

00:11:10.403 --> 00:11:12.405
CREATING MORE AND MORE SPRAWL

00:11:12.471 --> 00:11:14.173
COVERING UP FARMLAND AND OPEN

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.308
SPACE AND CLOGGING OUR FREEWAYS

00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:18.310
AN INCREASING CARBON EMISSIONS.

00:11:18.377 --> 00:11:20.513
AND CREATING A GROWING CLASS OF

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:22.515
SUPER COMMUTERS WHO SPENT FOUR

00:11:22.581 --> 00:11:23.349
OR FIVE HOURS A DAY.

00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:27.086
ON THE ROAD.

00:11:27.153 --> 00:11:29.255
THIS HOUSING SHORTAGE WHICH IS

00:11:29.321 --> 00:11:31.457
SELF INFLICTED IN MANY WAYS HAS

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:33.059
REAL LIFE CONSEQUENCES FOR

00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:36.328
PEOPLE IT PUSHES PEOPLE IN THE

00:11:36.395 --> 00:11:37.763
POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:38.898
AT SPIKE'S EVICTIONS AND

00:11:38.964 --> 00:11:41.000
DISPLACEMENT.

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:43.002
IT IT IS A PROBLEM AND WE HAVE

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:46.205
TO ADDRESS A AND WE WILL NEVER

00:11:46.272 --> 00:11:47.973
MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.942
IF WE CONTINUE TO HAVE PAPER LOW

00:11:50.009 --> 00:11:51.844
DENSITY ZONING NEAR JOBS IN

00:11:51.911 --> 00:11:52.711
TRANSIT.

00:11:52.778 --> 00:11:54.980
ALL WE WILL DO IS FORCE PEOPLE

00:11:55.047 --> 00:11:56.715
TO COMMUTE LONG HOURS.

00:11:56.782 --> 00:11:58.084
AND INCREASED CARBON EMISSIONS.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.119
SB FIFTY ADDRESSES THIS PROBLEM

00:12:00.186 --> 00:12:03.422
IN A THOUGHTFUL AND BALANCED WAY.

00:12:03.489 --> 00:12:05.124
OVER THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF.

00:12:05.191 --> 00:12:07.059
A WE HAVE WORKED WITH A BROAD

00:12:07.126 --> 00:12:08.828
SPECTRUM OF STAKEHOLDERS.

00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:10.396
INCLUDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:12.465
INTENDED ADVOCATES. FOR PROFIT

00:12:12.531 --> 00:12:14.400
AND NOT FOR PROFIT HOUSING

00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:15.568
DEVELOPERS.

00:12:15.634 --> 00:12:17.269
ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS

00:12:17.336 --> 00:12:20.072
LABOR UNIONS STUDENTS RELIGIOUS

LEADERS AND DISABILITY AND

00:12:22.041 --> 00:12:24.076
SENIOR ADVOCATES. TO CRAFT A

00:12:24.143 --> 00:12:27.613
BILL TO MOVE THE DIAL ON HOUSING.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.848
SO THAT WE MOVE AWAY FROM

00:12:28.914 --> 00:12:31.417
HOUSING ANXIETY AND TOWARD

00:12:31.484 --> 00:12:32.918
HOUSING ACTION.

00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:34.920
SB FIFTY PROVIDES AN AREAS

00:12:34.987 --> 00:12:36.856
WITHIN A HALF A MILE OF FIXED

00:12:39.658 --> 00:12:41.794
WITHIN A QUARTER MILE OF A HIGH

00:12:41.861 --> 00:12:43.863

00:12:47.566 --> 00:12:49.201
HIGH FREQUENCY.

00:12:49.268 --> 00:12:51.003
OR IN A JOB RICH AREA.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.238
THE CITY COULD NOT PUT AN

00:12:52.304 --> 00:12:54.607
ARBITRARY CAP ON DENSITY BY

00:12:54.673 --> 00:12:56.475
MANDATING FOR EXAMPLE ONLY ONE

00:12:56.542 --> 00:12:58.043

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:01.947
THE CITY ALSO CANNOT FORCE A

00:13:02.014 --> 00:13:03.682
HEIGHT LIMIT LOWER THAN FOUR OR

00:13:03.749 --> 00:13:05.317
FIVE STORIES.

00:13:05.384 --> 00:13:07.119
IN THE AREAS AROUND FIX RAIL OR

00:13:07.186 --> 00:13:08.954
FURRY.

00:13:09.021 --> 00:13:10.956
OF COURSE BASIC GEOMETRY AND THE

00:13:11.023 --> 00:13:12.625
BUILDING CODE PUT A NATURAL

00:13:12.691 --> 00:13:14.593
LIMIT ON DENSITY.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.061
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH SPACE AND

00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:18.164
THERE ARE BASIC REQUIREMENTS

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:19.365
UNDER THE BUILDING CODE.

00:13:19.431 --> 00:13:20.799
BUT WE WILL MOVE AWAY FROM THE

00:13:20.866 --> 00:13:23.969
ARBITRARY NUMERICAL COPS.

00:13:24.036 --> 00:13:25.304
BOB PLEASE NOTE THAT I

00:13:25.371 --> 00:13:26.772
ORIGINALLY LAST YEAR HAD IN EACH

00:13:26.839 --> 00:13:28.674
STORY OPTION IN THE BILL AND WE

00:13:28.741 --> 00:13:29.842
REMOVED THAT.

00:13:29.909 --> 00:13:31.443
LISTENING TO CONSTRUCTIVE

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.579
FEEDBACK SOME THE SUMMER ON

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.714
HAPPY THAT WE REMOVE THAT BUT

00:13:35.781 --> 00:13:38.584
SOME WERE VERY HAPPY -- AROUND

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:39.685
THE BUS STOPS AND JOB RICH AREAS

00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:41.287
THE BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THE

00:13:41.353 --> 00:13:43.455
ABILITY OF CITIES TO ENFORCE

00:13:43.522 --> 00:13:45.357
LOCAL HEIGHT LIMITS.

00:13:45.424 --> 00:13:46.425
MORE SETBACKS.

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:48.027
SO IF THE LOCAL HEIGHT LIMIT IS

00:13:48.093 --> 00:13:49.895
THIRTY FEET THAT HEIGHT LIMIT WE

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:52.064
WILL BE ADOPTED EFFECTIVELY BY

00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:53.232
SB.

00:13:53.299 --> 00:13:54.066
FIFTY BUT INSTEAD OF BEING

00:13:54.133 --> 00:13:55.768
MANDATED TO ONLY BUILD SINGLE

FAMILY YOU COULD BUILD LET'S SAY

00:13:58.037 --> 00:13:58.637
THREE FLAT.

00:13:58.704 --> 00:14:02.308
MULTI UNIT OR SIX TWO PER STORY.

00:14:02.374 --> 00:14:03.876
THE BUILDING WOULD LOOK THE SAME

00:14:03.943 --> 00:14:06.145
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

00:14:06.212 --> 00:14:07.913
THE SAME HEIGHT SAME SETBACK BUT

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.348
INSIDE IT WOULD HELL'S MORE

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:11.150
FAMILIES.

00:14:11.217 --> 00:14:12.851
ALSO IN RESPONSE TO FEEDBACK

00:14:12.918 --> 00:14:14.954
FROM TEN ADVOCATES.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.689
THIS BILL NOW CONTAINS.

00:14:16.755 --> 00:14:18.224
AMONG THE STRONGEST PERHAPS THE

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:20.392
STRONGEST TENER PROTECTIONS THAT

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:21.994
EXIST UNDER STATE LAW.

00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:23.362
SPECIFICALLY.

00:14:23.429 --> 00:14:25.531
IF A TENANT HAS RESIDED ON THE

00:14:25.598 --> 00:14:28.200
PROPERTY AT ANY POINT IN TIME IN

00:14:28.267 --> 00:14:30.069
THE LAST SEVEN YEARS.

00:14:30.135 --> 00:14:31.971
YOU CANNOT GET A DEMOLITION

00:14:32.037 --> 00:14:35.207
PERMIT TO BUILD UNDER THIS BILL.

00:14:35.274 --> 00:14:36.875
EVEN IF YOUR LOCAL CITY WOULD

00:14:36.942 --> 00:14:38.277
ALLOW YOU TO HAVE THAT PERMIT

00:14:38.344 --> 00:14:39.979
THIS BILL SAYS YOU CAN'T USE

00:14:40.045 --> 00:14:42.948
THIS BILL. TO START THE POLICY

00:14:43.015 --> 00:14:45.317
INTENDED OCCUPIED BUILDINGS THE

00:14:45.384 --> 00:14:46.585
BILL FURTHER PROVIDES THAT IF IN

00:14:46.652 --> 00:14:48.287
ELLIS ACTIVE ACTION HAS OCCURRED

00:14:48.354 --> 00:14:49.588
ON THE PROPERTY.

00:14:49.655 --> 00:14:52.258
IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS YOU

00:14:52.324 --> 00:14:53.759
CANNOT INVOKE THIS BILL.

00:14:53.826 --> 00:14:56.562
OUR GOAL HERE IS TO BE ADDITIVE

00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:58.030
WITH HOUSING TO ADD THE HOUSING

00:14:58.097 --> 00:15:01.166
WE NEED NOT TO REPLACE EXISTING

00:15:01.233 --> 00:15:02.468
RESIDENTS.

00:15:02.534 --> 00:15:04.036
I AM VERY SENSITIVE TO THE

00:15:04.103 --> 00:15:05.804
CONCERNS EXPRESSED AROUND

00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:07.373
DISPLACEMENT.

00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:08.374
WE HAVE EXPERIENCE OUT IN SAN

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.242
FRANCISCO IT IS HAPPENING AROUND

00:15:10.309 --> 00:15:12.144
THE STATE -- AND WE HAVE TO BE

00:15:12.211 --> 00:15:14.179
VERY CAREFUL THAT WE ARE ADDING

00:15:14.246 --> 00:15:16.382
THE HOUSING WE NEED WHICH WILL

00:15:16.448 --> 00:15:17.983
REDUCE DISPLACEMENT.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:19.618
BY STOPPING THIS RUN AWAY

00:15:19.685 --> 00:15:21.854
HOUSING MARKET.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.155
WHAT MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO

00:15:23.222 --> 00:15:24.223
ARE ALREADY LIVING IN A

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.191
COMMUNITY CAN STAY THERE?

00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:27.693
SB FIFTY REQUIRES THAT

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.428
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BE A PART OF

00:15:29.495 --> 00:15:30.863
NEW DEVELOPMENTS.

00:15:30.929 --> 00:15:33.732
ABOVE A CERTAIN SIZE.

00:15:33.799 --> 00:15:36.769
LOCAL INCLUSIONARY WILL APPLY IF

00:15:36.835 --> 00:15:38.304
THERE IS NO LOCAL INCLUSIONARY.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:39.204
THAN THIS.

00:15:39.271 --> 00:15:40.539
PROVIDES AN INCLUSIONARY

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:44.443

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.546
FINALLY -- SB FIFTY DIFFERS

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:49.682

00:15:49.748 --> 00:15:50.449
FIVE YEARS.

00:15:50.516 --> 00:15:52.618
IN WHAT WE CALL IN THE BILL SENT

00:15:52.685 --> 00:15:53.752
QUOTE UNQUOTE SENSITIVE

00:15:53.819 --> 00:15:55.254
COMMUNITIES THE FIND IS

00:15:55.321 --> 00:15:56.522
NEIGHBORHOODS WITH SIGNIFICANT

00:15:56.588 --> 00:15:59.358
LOW INCOME POPULATIONS.

00:15:59.425 --> 00:16:00.993
WITH RISK OF DISPLACEMENT.

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.394
SO THAT THESE COMMUNITIES CAN

00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:04.396
ENGAGE AND LOCAL ANTI

00:16:04.463 --> 00:16:05.831
DISPLACEMENT PLANNING.

00:16:05.898 --> 00:16:07.966
AND EXERCISE MORE FLEXIBILITY

00:16:08.033 --> 00:16:11.470
ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION -- IN

00:16:11.537 --> 00:16:13.505
THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS.

00:16:13.572 --> 00:16:14.807
KNOWN IN TALKING ABOUT THIS BILL

00:16:14.873 --> 00:16:16.542
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSION

00:16:16.608 --> 00:16:19.111
ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL -- WHILE THE

00:16:19.178 --> 00:16:20.746
BILL AS I DSCRIBED LARGELY

00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:23.215
RETAINS LOCAL CONTROL.

00:16:23.282 --> 00:16:25.150
IT DOES MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE

00:16:25.217 --> 00:16:27.720
STATE AND LOCAL DECISION MAKING

00:16:27.786 --> 00:16:28.687
BALANCE.

00:16:28.754 --> 00:16:30.489
JUST AS WE HAVE.

00:16:30.556 --> 00:16:33.158
A STATE LOCAL BALANCE AROUND

00:16:33.225 --> 00:16:34.827
PUBLIC EDUCATION.

00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:37.730
LOCAL CONTROL ISN'T BIBLICAL.

00:16:37.796 --> 00:16:39.665
LOCAL CONTROL IS A GOOD THING

00:16:39.732 --> 00:16:42.167
WHEN IT DELIVERS GOOD RESULTS

00:16:42.234 --> 00:16:43.969
AND IT USUALLY DOES DELIVER GOOD

00:16:44.036 --> 00:16:46.205
RESULTS AND I SAY THIS IS A

00:16:46.271 --> 00:16:48.941
FORMER LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIAL.

00:16:49.007 --> 00:16:50.275
BUT NOT ALWAYS.

00:16:50.342 --> 00:16:52.244
AND WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING

00:16:52.311 --> 00:16:55.114
CALIFORNIA'S SYSTEM OF ALMOST

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.815
PURE LOCAL CONTROL.

00:16:56.882 --> 00:16:59.585
HASN'T WORKED WE'RE NOT TRYING

00:16:59.651 --> 00:17:01.487

00:17:01.553 --> 00:17:03.322
FIND TO REFORMAT SO THAT WE CAN

00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:05.657
MOVE FORWARD AS A STATE.

00:17:05.724 --> 00:17:07.092
I ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT

00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:09.128

00:17:09.194 --> 00:17:10.496
IN PROGRESS.

00:17:10.562 --> 00:17:12.664
WE HAVE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS

00:17:12.731 --> 00:17:14.700
OVER THE PAST YEAR OR SO WORKING

00:17:14.767 --> 00:17:16.268

YEAR OR NEUTRAL.

00:17:21.573 --> 00:17:22.875
BUT WE'RE WILLING TO ENGAGE WITH

00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:25.911

00:17:25.978 --> 00:17:28.347

YOU KNOW PUSH OURSELVES TO GET

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.422

00:38:14.158 --> 00:38:15.159
REALLY DEEP DIVE WITH OUR BORDER

00:38:15.226 --> 00:38:16.293
POLICY COMMITTEES ARE INTERNAL

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.561
COMMITTEES AND COMMITTEES. TO

00:38:17.628 --> 00:38:18.829
TRY TO DETERMINE WHAT ARE THOSE

00:38:18.896 --> 00:38:20.631
SOLUTIONS MAYBE ALTERNATIVES --

00:38:20.698 --> 00:38:22.166
BUT WHAT CAN WE DO IN ORDER FOR

00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:24.068
THIS DISCUSSION -- AND TO BE

00:38:24.135 --> 00:38:25.503
REALLY CLEAR THOUGH -- YOU KNOW

00:38:25.569 --> 00:38:27.304
WE WE AGREE WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL

00:38:27.371 --> 00:38:28.673
PROBLEM THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH

00:38:28.739 --> 00:38:30.307
HOMES BEING BUILT IN CALIFORNIA.

00:38:30.374 --> 00:38:31.208
AND WE KNOW THAT WE ARE

00:38:31.275 --> 00:38:33.077
CERTAINLY PART OF THAT SOLUTION

00:38:33.144 --> 00:38:34.311
AND WE PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT

00:38:34.378 --> 00:38:35.813
PART AND SAY IN THE STAGE FOR

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:36.947
FOR DEVELOPMENT.

00:38:37.014 --> 00:38:39.050
WE ARE ABSOLUTELY IN SUPPORT OF

00:38:39.116 --> 00:38:41.652
MORE DENSITY AROUND KEY TRANSIT

00:38:41.719 --> 00:38:43.888
AND JOB CENTERS NEAR WERE OR

00:38:43.954 --> 00:38:44.989
ABSOLUTELY AND SUPPORT OF

00:38:45.056 --> 00:38:46.057
OPENING UP YOU KNOW OUR

00:38:46.123 --> 00:38:47.358
COMMUNITIES TO ALL THOSE FOLKS

00:38:47.425 --> 00:38:47.892
WHO WANT TO LIVE IN THOSE

00:38:47.958 --> 00:38:49.627
COMMUNITIES -- BUT I THINK

00:38:49.694 --> 00:38:50.795
THERE'S WAYS OF GOING ABOUT

00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:51.862
DOING IT PERHAPS THAT -- THAT

00:38:51.929 --> 00:38:54.865
MIGHT BE MORE ACCEPTABLE TO TO

00:38:54.932 --> 00:38:55.366
FOLKS.

00:38:55.433 --> 00:38:57.368
SO WHAT SPECIFICALLY REGARD SB

00:38:57.435 --> 00:38:59.036
FIFTY ON THE ISSUE -- THAT THAT

00:38:59.103 --> 00:39:00.404
IS YOU KNOW THE COURSE OF THIS

00:39:00.471 --> 00:39:01.839
IS REALLY THE UNDERMINING OF

00:39:01.906 --> 00:39:03.340
THIS EXISTING PLANTS AND WE

00:39:03.407 --> 00:39:04.675
HEARD A LOT ABOUT -- ILLEGALS

00:39:04.742 --> 00:39:06.711
OWNING AND NOT BE ABLE TO BUILD --

00:39:06.777 --> 00:39:08.179
WHILE IT'S NOT A FORMALLY

00:39:08.245 --> 00:39:09.747
AUTHORIZED TO BUILD A MULTI

00:39:09.814 --> 00:39:11.048
FAMILY IN A SINGLE FAMILY

00:39:11.115 --> 00:39:12.316
NEIGHBORHOOD AND NOTHING

00:39:12.383 --> 00:39:13.551
PROHIBITS A BILL FROM COMING

00:39:13.617 --> 00:39:14.719
INTO MY QUESTION IS ONLY CHANGE

00:39:14.785 --> 00:39:15.586
IN ORDER TO BUILD THAT -- SO

00:39:15.653 --> 00:39:16.654
THAT OFTEN DOES HAPPEN AND THEN

00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:18.522
IT WILL OCCUR BUT IT DOES ALSO

00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:19.690
MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT

00:39:19.757 --> 00:39:20.224
FOR THE DEVELOPER I'M TO

00:39:20.291 --> 00:39:21.892
ACTUALLY BUILD.

00:39:21.959 --> 00:39:23.227
NOW WITH REGARD TO THE PLANS IT

00:39:23.294 --> 00:39:23.928
WOULD JUST LIKE TO REMIND

00:39:23.994 --> 00:39:26.964
EVERYBODY THAT 90% 91% OF OUR

00:39:27.031 --> 00:39:28.165
CITIES ALL HAVE AN APPROVED

00:39:28.232 --> 00:39:29.166
HOUSING PLAN THIS IS SOMETHING

00:39:29.233 --> 00:39:30.134
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS

00:39:30.201 --> 00:39:31.168
APPROVED.

00:39:31.235 --> 00:39:32.837
IT IS REQUIRED BY LAW JUST IKE

00:39:32.903 --> 00:39:33.971
A GENERAL PLAN.

00:39:34.038 --> 00:39:35.706
AND WE HAVE ALL OF THE ZONING

00:39:35.773 --> 00:39:38.109
AND CITED IN EDUCATION NECESSARY

00:39:38.175 --> 00:39:40.111
TO ACCOMMODATE ALL OF THE GROWTH

00:39:40.177 --> 00:39:41.479
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAID WE

00:39:41.545 --> 00:39:42.913
MUST ACCOMMODATE INNER CITIES.

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:44.315
SO THE STATE IS COMPLETELY

00:39:44.381 --> 00:39:45.750
COMPLICIT WHEN IT COMES TO

00:39:45.816 --> 00:39:47.084
APPROVING THOSE PLANS SO IT IS

00:39:47.151 --> 00:39:48.519
SAYING THAT WE ARE READY FOR

00:39:48.586 --> 00:39:50.821
DEVELOPMENT AND DEVELOPERS COME

00:39:50.888 --> 00:39:52.189
IN AND DEVELOP SO THE IDEA THAT.

00:39:52.256 --> 00:39:53.991
WE'RE JUST NOT DOING WHAT WE

00:39:54.058 --> 00:39:55.626
SHOULD BE DOING IF WE ARE

00:39:55.693 --> 00:39:56.527
FOLLOWING THE HOUSING PLAN THAT

00:39:56.594 --> 00:40:04.268
IS APPROVED BY SEE THE

00:40:04.335 --> 00:40:05.870
CALIFORNIA WE ABSOLUTELY ARE.

00:40:05.936 --> 00:40:07.271
SO BY COMING IN AND HAVING THIS

00:40:07.338 --> 00:40:08.038
TOP DOWN APPROACH AND COMPLETELY

00:40:08.105 --> 00:40:08.906
UNDERMINING THOSE PLANS A REALLY

00:40:08.973 --> 00:40:10.241
QUESTIONS WHY CITIES HAVE TO DO

00:40:10.307 --> 00:40:10.908
GENERAL PLAN AND WHY CITIES NEED

00:40:10.975 --> 00:40:11.642
TO DO A HOUSING ELEMENT.

00:40:11.709 --> 00:40:12.143
AND INCORPORATE ALL THE

00:40:12.209 --> 00:40:13.410
COMMUNITY INPUT IT'S ALMOST AS

00:40:13.477 --> 00:40:14.044
IF WE'RE SETTING OUR CITIES UP

00:40:14.111 --> 00:40:14.678
TO FAIL YOU TELLS THE PLAN YOU

00:40:14.745 --> 00:40:16.447
pARE GOING TO BE CHANGED WITHOUT

00:40:16.514 --> 00:40:17.481
ADDITIONAL INPUT.

00:40:17.548 --> 00:40:20.284
SO PROVIDING THAT OPPORTUNITY

00:40:20.351 --> 00:40:20.785
FOR INPUT IS INCREDIBLY

00:40:20.851 --> 00:40:23.420
IMPORTANT -- I WOULD ALSO LIKE

00:40:23.487 --> 00:40:24.955
TO MENTION THAT SB FIFTY I'M

00:40:25.022 --> 00:40:26.824
STILL HAS THE DEVELOPER OFTEN

00:40:26.891 --> 00:40:27.992
APPROACH WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT

00:40:28.058 --> 00:40:29.493
THAT WE CERTAINLY HAVE CONCERNS

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:30.094
WITH.

00:40:30.161 --> 00:40:31.061
BECAUSE IT'S NOT SITTING STATE

00:40:31.128 --> 00:40:32.863
POLICY THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:34.198
THE DEVELOPERS GOING TO BUILD A

00:40:34.265 --> 00:40:37.134
MAXIMUM HEIGHT THE MAXIM DENSITY.

00:40:37.201 --> 00:40:38.002
IMPORTANT TRANSIT HUB THEY COULD

00:40:38.068 --> 00:40:39.403
FLUCTUATE BETWEEN THEIR SO WE

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:40.838
WOULD RECOMMEND THAT IF THE

00:40:40.905 --> 00:40:42.306
STATE WANTS TO HAVE A POLICY

00:40:42.373 --> 00:40:43.841
MAYBE SHE LITTLE PRESCRIPTIVE IN

00:40:43.908 --> 00:40:44.809
WHAT'S THAT HEIGHT WHAT'S THAT

00:40:44.875 --> 00:40:46.343
DENSITY THEY LIKE TO SEE.

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:47.878
AND NOT ALLOW IT OVER TO TO PICK

00:40:47.945 --> 00:40:50.447
AND CHOOSE -- AND FINALLY YOU

00:40:50.514 --> 00:40:51.982
KNOW I WOULD LIKE TO TO TO SAY

00:40:52.049 --> 00:40:52.917
THEY CERTAINLY APPRECIATE

00:40:52.983 --> 00:40:54.018
SENATOR WINNERS --

00:40:54.084 --> 00:40:55.352
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT COMMUNITIES

00:40:55.419 --> 00:40:56.020
ARE DIFFERENT AND THERE ARE

00:40:56.086 --> 00:40:57.087
COMMUNITIES THAT MAY NEED A

00:40:57.154 --> 00:40:58.355
LITTLE MORE TIME TO UPDATE THEIR

00:40:58.422 --> 00:41:00.391
PLANS -- WE JUST THINK THAT

00:41:00.457 --> 00:41:01.358
PERHAPS ALL COMMITTEE SHOULD

00:41:01.425 --> 00:41:02.560
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COME UP

00:41:02.626 --> 00:41:04.061
WITH AN ALTERNATIVE THAT STILL

00:41:04.128 --> 00:41:05.229
MEETS THE STATE CRITERIA THE

00:41:05.296 --> 00:41:06.564
STATE CAN BE VERY SPECIFIC IN

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:07.398
WHAT THEY WANT.

00:41:07.464 --> 00:41:08.732
BUT ALLOW THE FLEXIBILITY THE

00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:11.068
LOCAL LEVEL FOR US TO MEET THOSE

00:41:11.135 --> 00:41:15.172
NEEDS AND WITH THAT I'LL HAND IT

00:41:15.239 --> 00:41:15.773
OVER TO THE NEXT SPEAKER THANK

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.242
YOU.

00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:19.443
I GUESS SON THANK YOU KAREN

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:20.077
KLINGER LOCAL REAL ESTATE BROKER

00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:22.012
I OPPOSE SORRY IT SOUNDS LIKE A

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:23.247
GREAT BILL BUT WE ALREADY HAVE

00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:25.216
THAT IN OUR COUNTY GENERAL PLAN

00:41:25.282 --> 00:41:26.717
UPDATE AND MORE.

00:41:26.784 --> 00:41:30.287
THIS IS BY RIGHT ANYTHING THAT --

00:41:30.354 --> 00:41:31.789
YOU'RE SAYING.

00:41:31.856 --> 00:41:33.424
YOU WANT TO HAVE BUILT LIKE IT'S

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:34.892
NOW SEVEN STORIES NOT EIGHT BY

00:41:34.959 --> 00:41:37.094
THE POTENTIAL OF EIGHT STORIES

00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:39.697
THIS WOULD DESTROY MY SUBURBAN.

00:41:39.763 --> 00:41:42.633
SINGLE FAMILY ONE HOME PER LOT

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:43.567
NEIGHBORHOOD [inaudible]

00:41:43.634 --> 00:41:47.071
BECAUSE IT IS MY RIGHT THE LOCAL

00:41:47.137 --> 00:41:48.739
OFFICIALS WOULD BE ELIMINATED

00:41:48.806 --> 00:41:50.207
UNDER THIS PROCESS YOU WOULD

00:41:50.274 --> 00:41:52.309
HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF AGENCIES

OKAY -- ANOTHER QUESTION IS.

00:56:29.652 --> 00:56:30.987

00:57:07.457 --> 00:57:09.325
ISSUES OF GENTRIFICATION THAT

00:57:09.392 --> 00:57:11.961
HAVE ALREADY STARTED.

00:57:12.028 --> 00:57:13.930

THAT ISSUE BOTH AT A AT A

00:57:26.009 --> 00:57:27.877
STATEWIDE LEVEL -- AND ALSO IN

00:57:27.944 --> 00:57:30.680
THE BAY AREA -- AND WE PROVIDE

00:57:30.747 --> 00:57:33.149
SOME A LOT OF STUDENTS TERMS OF

00:57:33.216 --> 00:57:35.852
ADMINISTRATIVE IMPLEMENTATION --

AND THAT'LL BE A CONTINUING OUR

00:57:37.921 --> 00:57:41.624
DISCUSSION -- WE I WANT ONE

THING I DO WANT TO KNOW I'M ONLY

00:57:44.227 --> 00:57:47.163
BECAUSE THE META FROM THE

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:47.664
MISSION.

00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:48.565
WHAT'S YOUR TESTIFYING AGAINST

00:57:48.631 --> 00:57:51.301
THE THERE ARE LOW INCOME

00:57:51.367 --> 00:57:52.836
COMMUNITY THIS IS NOT ALL THERE

00:57:52.902 --> 00:57:54.604
AREAS LIKE ITSELF LA OR PARTS OF

00:57:54.671 --> 00:57:57.674
OAKLAND -- THAT ARE ZONED -- LOW

00:57:57.740 --> 00:57:59.475
DENSITY BUT WE KNOW THAT

00:57:59.542 --> 00:58:01.244
DISPROPORTIONATELY.

00:58:01.311 --> 00:58:03.012
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES -- ARE

00:58:03.079 --> 00:58:04.747
OFTEN ZONE THAT HIGH DENSITY

00:58:04.814 --> 00:58:06.583
ALREADY BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN THE

00:58:06.649 --> 00:58:08.418
INEQUITABLE APPROACH WE TAKE IN

00:58:08.484 --> 00:58:10.286
THE HOUSING FOR A LONG TIME IN

00:58:10.353 --> 00:58:11.554
THE STATE OR WEALTHIER.

00:58:11.621 --> 00:58:13.523
PLACES HAVE LOW DENSITY SINGLE

00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:16.793
FAMILY HOME -- AND LOWER INCOME

SIGNIFICANT DENSITY -- AND SO I

00:58:23.633 --> 00:58:25.235
THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO

00:58:25.301 --> 00:58:27.036
KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE ARE

00:58:27.103 --> 00:58:28.438
PLENTY OF COMMUNITIES.

00:58:28.504 --> 00:58:30.673
THAT ARE AT RISK FOR BEING

00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:31.774
GENDER FIGHTER MAYBE GENTRIFIED.

00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:33.676
THAT WON'T HAVE MUCH IMPACT FROM

00:58:33.743 --> 00:58:34.277
THIS BILL BECAUSE ARE ALREADY

00:58:34.344 --> 00:58:43.720
ZONED. FOR DENSITY -- BUT THAT

00:58:43.786 --> 00:58:45.455

BUT THEY ARE COMPETITIVE BILLS

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:42.552
THEY'RE SIMILAR WITH THEIR SOME

01:03:42.618 --> 01:03:44.854
UNIQUE DIFFERENCES AND WE'RE

01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:45.054

THANK YOU SIR WIENER FOR YOUR

01:04:18.788 --> 01:04:19.789
WORK ON THIS VERY DIFFICULT

01:04:19.855 --> 01:04:20.823
PROBLEMS ONE OF THE MOST

01:04:20.890 --> 01:04:22.558
CHALLENGING ISSUES I THINK

01:04:22.625 --> 01:04:23.926
FACING THE STATE -- SOME

01:04:23.993 --> 01:04:26.062
QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE

01:04:26.128 --> 01:04:28.130
AREAS OF FOCUS -- ONE OF YOURS A

01:04:28.197 --> 01:04:29.832
FOCUS UNDERSTAND IT'S QUARTER

01:04:29.899 --> 01:04:30.866
MILE [inaudible]

01:04:30.933 --> 01:04:34.036
OF RADIUS -- IN CONNECTION WITH

01:04:34.103 --> 01:04:35.871
A BUS STOP ON A FORGOTTEN THE

01:04:35.938 --> 01:04:37.974
TERM HIGH FREQUENCY HIGH

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.141
FREQUENCY CORRIDOR.

01:04:39.208 --> 01:04:41.077
SO.

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:43.012
IF IF THAT BUS STOP MOVE WHAT

01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:44.914
HAPPENS OF THAT BUS STOP MOVES

01:04:44.981 --> 01:04:47.016
TWO YEARS AFTER [inaudible]

01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:49.218
CONSTRUCTION BEGINS.

01:04:49.285 --> 01:04:52.221
BOB ONE OF THE REASONS -- UP

01:04:52.288 --> 01:04:55.725
FIRST OF ALL -- BY STOCKS FIVE

01:04:55.791 --> 01:04:57.393
YES IT'S POSSIBLE FOR A BUS STOP

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:59.061
TO MOVE -- I DON'T THINK IT'S

01:04:59.128 --> 01:05:01.063
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS ALL THE

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:02.265
TIME AND SINCE WHEN IT DOES

01:05:02.331 --> 01:05:03.799
HAPPEN IT MIGHT BE A MOVES

01:05:03.866 --> 01:05:06.002
ACROSS THE STREET ONE BLOCK OVER --

01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:07.670
SO IS IT POSSIBLE FOR BOTH OF

01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:09.105
THEM OF COURSE IT IS I DON'T

01:05:09.171 --> 01:05:10.973
THINK IT'S A COMMON. ONE OF THE

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.042
READING WE ORIGINALLY PROPOSED

01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:14.777
THIS BILL IS SP TWO SEVEN LAST

01:05:14.844 --> 01:05:15.278
YEAR.

01:05:15.344 --> 01:05:17.280
BOB BUS STOPS TRIGGERED THE SAME

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:19.415
HEIGHT CHANGES THAT FIXED RAIL

01:05:19.482 --> 01:05:19.849
THAT.

01:05:19.915 --> 01:05:21.851
OUGHT WE TO IN RESPONSE TO YOUR

01:05:21.917 --> 01:05:24.854
EXACT QUESTION WE CHANGE IT TO

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:27.423
SAY THIS BILL WILL DEFER TO

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:28.324
LOCAL HEIGHT LIMITS AROUND

01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:30.860
BOSSES. TO TRY TO STRIKE THAT

01:05:30.926 --> 01:05:32.895
BALANCE BUT IN THE END GOD

01:05:32.962 --> 01:05:35.531
SOMEONE BILLS SAY AN ITALIAN

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:36.165
ABILITY THING AND THE BUS STOP

01:05:36.232 --> 01:05:37.066
MOVED.

01:05:37.133 --> 01:05:39.402
A FEW BLOCKS OVER IT THAT'S NOT

01:05:39.468 --> 01:05:40.603
THE END OF THE WORLD WE HAVE

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:43.272
APARTMENT BUILDINGS ALL OVER.

01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:45.441
CALIFORNIA NOT ENOUGH PLACES

01:05:45.508 --> 01:05:46.976
SINCE MOST OF IT IS KNOWN TO MAN

01:05:47.043 --> 01:05:48.110
AT BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF OUR

01:05:48.177 --> 01:05:49.679
BUILDINGS THAT WERE BUILT BEFORE

01:05:49.745 --> 01:05:51.547
THOSE BANDS WENT INTO EFFECT --

01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:53.983
SO I I DON'T SEE IT AS A

01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:55.251
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM.

01:05:55.318 --> 01:05:56.819
I THINK IN AREAS THAT ARE

01:05:56.886 --> 01:05:58.688
DEVELOP SERVICES GO FOR EXAMPLE

01:05:58.754 --> 01:06:00.423
IT'S LESS OF AN ISSUE THAN AREAS

01:06:00.489 --> 01:06:08.631
THAT ARE DEVELOPING -- WHERE?

01:06:08.698 --> 01:06:10.833
ROUTES CHANGE DENSITY CHANGES

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:11.867
AND YOU CAN MOVE A BIT BUS STOPS.

01:06:11.934 --> 01:06:12.902
MAY MOVE A QUARTER OF A MILE OR

01:06:12.968 --> 01:06:13.736
HALF A MILE.

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:15.371
SO THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEND A

01:06:15.438 --> 01:06:16.038
LITTLE TIME WITH YOU.

01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:17.540
TRYING TO SEE IF WE CAN'T

01:06:17.606 --> 01:06:19.375
SOMEHOW -- MAKE SURE WE WE WE

01:06:19.442 --> 01:06:21.077
DEAL WITH THAT ISSUE SO THAT YOU

01:06:21.143 --> 01:06:22.211
DON'T HAVE.

01:06:22.278 --> 01:06:24.547
SORT OF A A BUS STOP EVERY

01:06:24.613 --> 01:06:26.148
QUARTER OF A MILE WHICH

01:06:26.215 --> 01:06:29.485
BASICALLY -- CHANGES.

01:06:29.552 --> 01:06:30.553
CHANGES THE THE WHOLE TENOR THAT

01:06:30.619 --> 01:06:32.054
BILLS WE WOULD WELCOME THAT

01:06:32.121 --> 01:06:33.823
DIALOGUE IN YOUR FEEDBACK ONE

01:06:33.889 --> 01:06:35.124

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.295
TO AT ASHOKE I SET HIGH

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:40.763
FREQUENCY IT'S WITH A BIG LABEL

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:43.232
AT HIGH QUALITY BOSS QUARTER.

01:06:43.299 --> 01:06:44.934
AND IT'S AROUND THE BUS STOP NOT

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.569
AROUND AREAS IN BETWEEN THEM.

01:06:46.635 --> 01:06:48.604

01:08:47.423 --> 01:08:49.058
THERE ARE FOUR FAR MORE.

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.960
CAN I PROTECTIONS.

01:08:51.026 --> 01:08:54.730
AND THERE IT IMPACTS COMMUNITIES

01:08:54.797 --> 01:08:56.632
NEIGHBORHOODS SOME MAY SAY

01:08:56.699 --> 01:09:00.769
NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WHERE.

01:09:00.836 --> 01:09:01.604
SOMEBODY FOR NEIGHBORHOODS

01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:03.105
ALREADY HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY

01:09:03.172 --> 01:09:05.040
GENTRIFIED BUT THE WAY THIS IS

01:09:05.107 --> 01:09:06.108
STRUCTURED IS THAT.

01:09:06.175 --> 01:09:08.544
IT [inaudible]

01:09:08.611 --> 01:09:10.513
DOES NOT.

01:09:10.579 --> 01:09:13.115
ADD THIS INCREASE DENSITY IN

01:09:13.182 --> 01:09:15.951
THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT.

01:09:16.018 --> 01:09:17.620
WHERE THE GENTRIFICATION HASN'T

01:09:17.686 --> 01:09:20.356
COMPLETELY YOU KNOW IS NOT?

01:09:20.422 --> 01:09:21.790
YET A FETE ACCOMPLI.

01:09:21.857 --> 01:09:24.326
AND I REALLY RESPECT THAT AND I

01:09:24.393 --> 01:09:25.828
REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:31.700
YOU'VE DONE -- WE YOU SAID IN

01:09:31.767 --> 01:09:33.802
YOUR OPENING.

01:09:33.869 --> 01:09:35.304
I THINK WE KNOW IT.

01:09:35.371 --> 01:09:36.772
WE'VE HEARD IT FROM THE GOVERNOR

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:40.509
WE'VE HEARD IT FOR ANY ANY SET

01:09:40.576 --> 01:09:42.177
OF DATA POINTS THAT WE LOOK AT

01:09:42.244 --> 01:09:45.347
CALIFORNIA IS IN A HOUSING

01:09:45.414 --> 01:09:46.549
CRISIS.

01:09:46.615 --> 01:09:49.285
NO CERTAINLY MANY OF US LOOK AT

01:09:49.351 --> 01:09:49.752
IT THROUGH THE LENS OF

01:09:49.818 --> 01:09:51.086
AFFORDABILITY.

01:09:51.153 --> 01:09:53.522
BUT WE HAVE TO ALSO LOOK AT IT

01:09:53.589 --> 01:09:55.424
THROUGH THE LENS OF SUPPLY

01:09:55.491 --> 01:09:55.724
[inaudible]

01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:57.426
AND WHILE.

01:09:57.493 --> 01:10:00.229
I AM NOT THE BIGGEST FAN OF

01:10:00.296 --> 01:10:01.931
UNFETTERED.

01:10:01.997 --> 01:10:03.599
MARKET CAPITALISM AND I'LL BE UP

01:10:03.666 --> 01:10:05.601
FRONT ABOUT THAT.

01:10:05.668 --> 01:10:08.203
THE FACT IS THAT.

01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:11.307
OUR THIRTY TO FORTY YEAR

01:10:11.373 --> 01:10:13.776
SUPPRESSION OF BUILDING HOUSING

01:10:13.842 --> 01:10:15.477
IN CALIFORNIA.

01:10:15.544 --> 01:10:17.780
HAS COME BACK TO HARNESS.

01:10:17.846 --> 01:10:19.014
AND THAT.

01:10:19.081 --> 01:10:20.916
LACK OF SUPPLY THE FACT THAT IN

01:10:20.983 --> 01:10:23.719
YOU STAYED IN YOU AGAIN ANY DATA

01:10:23.786 --> 01:10:25.421
POINT ANYONE WANTS TO LOOK AT WE

01:10:25.487 --> 01:10:27.156
ARE.

01:10:27.222 --> 01:10:27.756
FORTY NINE IN NUMBER OF UNITS

01:10:27.823 --> 01:10:31.226
PER CAPITA [inaudible] FORTY

01:10:31.293 --> 01:10:32.428
NINE WE HAVE THIRTY THREE OF THE

01:10:32.494 --> 01:10:33.495
HIGHEST RENT CITIES IN THE

01:10:33.562 --> 01:10:36.966
ENTIRE U. S. OUT OF FIFTY TO

01:10:37.032 --> 01:10:39.001
PURCHASE A HOUSE COST TWO POINT

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:40.769
FIVE TIMES MORE THAN ANYWHERE

01:10:40.836 --> 01:10:43.405
ELSE IN THE COUNTRY.

01:10:43.472 --> 01:10:46.809
THESE ARE FACTORS OF SCARCITY

01:10:46.875 --> 01:10:49.845
SCARCITY DRIVES UP PRICES.

01:10:49.912 --> 01:10:52.214
THE DRIVING DRIVING UP OF PRICES

01:10:52.281 --> 01:10:55.584
THEN DRIVES PEOPLE OUT.

01:10:55.651 --> 01:10:58.754
CREATES HOMELESSNESS.

01:10:58.821 --> 01:11:00.089
YES WE HAVE TO BUILD MORE

01:11:00.155 --> 01:11:02.024
AFFORDABLE HOUSING YES WE HAVE

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:04.293
TO HAVE INCLUSIONARY YES WE HAVE

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:05.961
TO HAVE ALL THOSE THINGS BUT WE

01:11:06.028 --> 01:11:08.464
ARE STILL NOT GOING TO BE ABLE

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:10.232
TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING CRISIS

01:11:10.299 --> 01:11:12.468
WITHOUT AN INCREASE IN SUPPLY.

01:11:12.534 --> 01:11:14.436
AND THIS IS A REASONABLE AND

01:11:14.503 --> 01:11:17.873
SMART INCREASE IN SUPPLY BECAUSE

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:19.608
IT IS AROUND OR TRANSIT AREAS.

01:11:19.675 --> 01:11:22.378
AND I COMPLETELY SUPPORT

01:11:22.444 --> 01:11:22.678
[inaudible]

01:11:22.745 --> 01:11:23.612
DOES RESULT [inaudible]

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:25.247
NOW.

01:11:25.314 --> 01:11:29.084
I APPRECIATE THOSE.

01:11:29.151 --> 01:11:32.488
FOLKS WHO'VE COME TO THE THE

01:11:32.554 --> 01:11:34.456
MIKE TO COME HERE AT THE HEARING

01:11:34.523 --> 01:11:36.692
BECAUSE THE VERY FEARFUL.

01:11:36.759 --> 01:11:38.093
THAT THEY COULD BE DISPLACED

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.995
FROM THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:11:40.062 --> 01:11:42.431
AND CERTAINLY WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:11:42.498 --> 01:11:44.333
THE WAY PRICES HAVE GONE UP IN

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.434
ANY.

01:11:45.501 --> 01:11:48.504
OF OUR JOB RICH AREAS WERE ALL

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:51.040
THE FREE TO THAT.

01:11:51.106 --> 01:11:52.941
I AM IN A YOU KNOW I'M ABOVE

01:11:53.008 --> 01:11:54.343
MIDDLE CLASS.

01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:55.644
BUT IF I WERE TO LOSE MY HOUSE

01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:58.213
TODAY I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.548
LIVE IN MY COMMUNITY OF BERKELEY.

01:11:59.615 --> 01:12:01.283
AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH RIGHT

01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:02.851
NOW IN BERKELEY THE BIGGEST

01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:05.754
CHANGE.

01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:07.489
IN THE LAST TWO SENTENCES.

01:12:07.556 --> 01:12:11.193
HAVE BEEN HAS BEEN THE AVERAGE

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.662
INCOME OF BERKELEY RESIDENTS WHY.

01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:15.698
BECAUSE HOUSING IS SO EXPENSIVE

01:12:15.764 --> 01:12:17.633
KNOW WHAT A BERKELEY DO BERKELEY

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:18.767
IN THE SEVENTIES PASSED THE

01:12:18.834 --> 01:12:19.835
NEIGHBORHOOD PRESERVATION

01:12:19.902 --> 01:12:21.136
ORDINANCE WHICH BASICALLY

01:12:21.203 --> 01:12:22.705
PREVENTED BERKELEY FROM ALLOWING

01:12:22.771 --> 01:12:24.039
ANY APARTMENT BUILDINGS.

01:12:24.106 --> 01:12:25.541
TODAY THE VERY FEW APARTMENT

01:12:25.607 --> 01:12:27.276
BUILDINGS THERE HAVE BEEN SOME

01:12:27.342 --> 01:12:30.245
BUILT IN THE LAST. EIGHT YEARS

01:12:30.312 --> 01:12:30.846
BUT PRIOR TO THAT NONE WERE

01:12:30.913 --> 01:12:32.648
BUILT.

01:12:32.715 --> 01:12:34.083
OVER GOOD THIRTY YEAR PERIOD.

01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:36.051
TODAY THE ONLY LOW INCOME PEOPLE

01:12:36.118 --> 01:12:37.619
THAT STILL REMAIN A BERKELEY ARE

01:12:37.686 --> 01:12:38.821
IN THOSE APARTMENT BUILDINGS

01:12:38.887 --> 01:12:40.456
THAT WERE BUILT PRE THE

01:12:40.522 --> 01:12:40.989
NEIGHBORHOOD PRESERVATION

01:12:41.056 --> 01:12:45.461
ORDINANCE -- UNLESS YOU HAVE

01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:47.930
LIVED IN A SINGLE FAMILY HOME

01:12:47.996 --> 01:12:49.631
THAT IS RENT CONTROLLED FOR

01:12:49.698 --> 01:12:51.967
TWENTY FIVE YEARS OR MORE.

01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:53.402
YOU PRETTY MUCH CAN'T AFFORD

01:12:53.469 --> 01:12:55.537
ANYWHERE TO LIVE IN BERKELEY.

01:12:55.604 --> 01:12:58.173
UNLESS YOU AGAIN WERE ON SECTION

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:00.242
EIGHT WHICH MOST RENT MOST

01:13:00.309 --> 01:13:01.443
OWNERS IN BERKELEY WON'T EVEN

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:02.478
TAKE A SECTION EIGHT TENANT

01:13:02.544 --> 01:13:04.279
ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY CAN GET SO

01:13:04.346 --> 01:13:05.214
MUCH MORE.

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.982
IN A MARKET RATE.

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:08.817
AND I USE JUST MY CITY IS

01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:11.019
EXAMPLE BECAUSE I KNOW IT SO

01:13:11.086 --> 01:13:12.788
WELL BUT I COULD USE MANY MANY

01:13:12.855 --> 01:13:15.357
MANY MANY MANY OTHER CITIES.

01:13:15.424 --> 01:13:17.860
SO WE HAVE TO FIX IT AND THIS IS

01:13:17.926 --> 01:13:19.795
ONE WAY TO FIX IT AND I DON'T

01:13:19.862 --> 01:13:21.130
BLAME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALONE

01:13:21.196 --> 01:13:22.765
THERE ARE SO MANY FACTORS THAT

01:13:22.831 --> 01:13:23.832
CONTRIBUTED TO BURKE TO

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:25.367
CALIFORNIA.

01:13:25.434 --> 01:13:26.969
UNDER BUILDING THERE ARE SO MANY

01:13:27.035 --> 01:13:29.238
FACTORS PRIVATE SECTOR WASN'T

01:13:29.304 --> 01:13:32.407
INVESTING IN URBAN AREAS FOR

01:13:32.474 --> 01:13:34.743
RESIDENTIAL PROP THIRTEEN DIDN'T

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:36.145
MOTIVATE ANY LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:13:36.211 --> 01:13:38.080
THERE'S SO MANY FACTORS BUT WHEN

01:13:38.147 --> 01:13:39.448
YOU TAKE THE COLLECTIVE.

01:13:39.515 --> 01:13:41.183
INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS BY LOCAL

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:42.684
GOVERNMENTS OVER THIS ENTIRE

01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:43.952
PERIOD OF TIME AND ALL THOSE

01:13:44.019 --> 01:13:45.521
OTHER FACTORS YOU HAVE THE

01:13:45.587 --> 01:13:47.422
CRISIS WE HAVE TODAY AND WE HAVE

01:13:47.489 --> 01:13:48.724
TO FIX IT.

01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:51.026
AND I SUPPORT RENT CONTROL I

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:53.028
SUPPORTED PROP.

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:53.595
TEN I SUPPORT JUST BECAUSE

01:13:53.662 --> 01:13:55.497
EVICTION AND I KNOW THAT MANY OF

01:13:55.564 --> 01:13:56.431
THE FOLKS.

01:13:56.498 --> 01:13:57.933
THAT SUPPORT THIS BILL THAT ARE

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.204
MORE IN THE BUILDING BUT YOU

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:04.006
KNOW IN THAT SPHERE ARE NOT AS

01:14:04.072 --> 01:14:05.574
HAPPY WITH THOSE TYPES OF

01:14:05.641 --> 01:14:07.209
POLICIES THIS BILL DOESN'T

01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:08.677
NECESSARILY ADDRESS THOSE.

01:14:08.744 --> 01:14:10.913
BUT WE HAVE TO DO BOTH WE HAVE

01:14:10.979 --> 01:14:12.714
TO PROTECT EXISTING TENANTS AND

01:14:12.781 --> 01:14:14.683
WE HAVE TO BUILD MORE FOR WERE

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:15.984
NOT GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS

01:14:16.051 --> 01:14:17.352
CRISIS AND THIS BILL.

01:14:17.419 --> 01:14:18.587
IS.

01:14:18.654 --> 01:14:20.622
APPROPRIATE AND RIGHT

01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:21.924
ADDITIONALLY.

01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.791
WE HAVE SUPER COMMUTING

01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:25.894
CALIFORNIA NOW.

01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:27.896
SUPER COMMUTES BECAUSE THE VERY

01:14:27.963 --> 01:14:30.132
FEW PEOPLE THAT ARE YET HOMELESS.

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:33.936
LIVE. EIGHTY TO A HUNDRED TWO

01:14:34.002 --> 01:14:36.405
MORE MILES AWAY FROM THEIR JOBS.

01:14:36.471 --> 01:14:38.273
BECAUSE THE THAT'S A HUNDRED

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:39.508
MILES AWAY IS THE ONLY PLACE

01:14:39.575 --> 01:14:42.277
THEY CAN AFFORD THAT IS WRONG.

01:14:42.344 --> 01:14:44.246
AND WE HAVE TO FIX THAT ALSO SO

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:45.881
I AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL I

01:14:45.948 --> 01:14:47.149
APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'VE

01:14:47.216 --> 01:14:52.821
DONE -- AND IF THANK YOU.

01:14:52.888 --> 01:14:55.824
SENATOR BATES THANK YOU.

01:14:55.891 --> 01:14:58.260
LET ME ADD MY OUR KUDOS ON TO

01:14:58.327 --> 01:15:00.329
YOU SENATOR WINNER FOR TAKING ON

01:15:00.395 --> 01:15:01.797
A PROJECT LONG OVERDUE.

01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:03.765
CERTAINLY ARE LOTS OF WORK NEEDS

01:15:03.832 --> 01:15:05.968
TO BE DONE ON UNFORTUNATELY I'M

01:15:06.034 --> 01:15:07.069
NOT COULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT

01:15:07.135 --> 01:15:08.871
TODAY ON MY BIGGEST ISSUE THE

01:15:08.937 --> 01:15:11.206
HAS BEEN AND I THINK OF SHARE

01:15:11.273 --> 01:15:11.840
THAT WITH YOU ALL ALONG IS THE

01:15:11.907 --> 01:15:12.741
PARKING.

01:15:12.808 --> 01:15:15.911
RESTRICTIONS THAT WILL BE LIFTED

01:15:15.978 --> 01:15:18.347
BECAUSE PARKING IN OUR SUBURBAN

01:15:18.413 --> 01:15:20.582
COMMUNITIES TO DRIVE SO MANY

01:15:20.649 --> 01:15:21.783
PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES I WANT.

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:22.885
YOU KNOW GET INTO SO MANY OF

01:15:22.951 --> 01:15:24.553
THOSE TODAY BUT WE CAN CONTINUE

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:28.056
TO DISCUSS AS WE GO FORWARD I

01:15:28.123 --> 01:15:29.691
JUST LIKE.

01:15:29.758 --> 01:15:31.526
TO I ASK A FEW QUESTIONS ARE --

01:15:31.593 --> 01:15:32.794
BEGINNING WITH THE DEFINITION HI

01:15:32.861 --> 01:15:34.229
JOBS RICH AREA IT'S IDENTIFIED

01:15:34.296 --> 01:15:35.797
BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND

01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:37.499
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ANNOUNCES

01:15:37.566 --> 01:15:38.700
SENSITIVE COMMUNITY.

01:15:38.767 --> 01:15:40.435
AND I'M WONDERING IF THAT IS

01:15:40.502 --> 01:15:43.171
PRESENT IT IN IF IT'S RESPECTIVE

01:15:43.238 --> 01:15:44.840
LAWRENCE RETRO ACTIVE.

01:15:44.907 --> 01:15:47.409
AS WE GO FORWARD WHEN SOMEONE

01:15:47.476 --> 01:15:49.745
COMES TO A COMMUNITY AND WANTS

01:15:49.811 --> 01:15:52.781
TO DEVELOP -- A PROPERTY AND

01:15:52.848 --> 01:15:54.616
SEEKS THE DEFINITION TO ALLOW

01:15:54.683 --> 01:15:56.385
THEM TO GO FORWARD WHAT IS THE

01:15:56.451 --> 01:15:58.587
POINT IN TIME BECAUSE I THINK

01:15:58.654 --> 01:16:00.722
THESE ARE TWO AREAS THAT COULD --

01:16:00.789 --> 01:16:01.823
BE GAME TO A LITTLE BIT

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:03.959
DEPENDING ON ON THE APPLICATION

01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:05.594
PROCESS.

01:16:05.661 --> 01:16:07.162
HOW DO YOU SEE THESE SUPPLIED --

01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:08.997
IN THE CURRENT WHEN THIS GOES

01:16:09.064 --> 01:16:10.699
INTO EFFECT IS IT TWENTY TWENTY

01:16:10.766 --> 01:16:11.867
AND THEN SOME COMMUNITIES ARE

01:16:11.934 --> 01:16:12.668
GOING TO BE ALLOWED AN

01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:14.670
ADDITIONAL FIVE OR SIX YEARS TO

01:16:14.736 --> 01:16:15.871
IMPLEMENT A PLAN.

01:16:15.938 --> 01:16:17.039
WHICH COULD CHANGE THIS

01:16:17.105 --> 01:16:18.774
DRAMATICALLY IF YOU DON'T HAVE A

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.509
PLAN COMMUNITY PLAN AND I BRING

01:16:20.575 --> 01:16:22.277
THAT UP BECAUSE MOST OF SOUTH

01:16:22.344 --> 01:16:23.645
ORANGE COUNTY.

01:16:23.712 --> 01:16:25.514
WAS DEVELOPED A LONG PLANNED

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:27.749
COMMUNITY PLANS WHICH INCLUDED

01:16:27.816 --> 01:16:30.485
AFFORDABLE HOUSING LOW INCOME --

01:16:30.552 --> 01:16:32.421
APARTMENTS WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:16:32.487 --> 01:16:33.588
APARTMENTS IN SOUTH ORANGE

01:16:33.655 --> 01:16:34.990
COUNTY SOME I THINK MANY

01:16:35.057 --> 01:16:37.159
COMMUNITIES ARE STILL WORKING ON

01:16:37.225 --> 01:16:37.793
THE RENO.

01:16:37.859 --> 01:16:39.561
THAT TIME NOT TO THEY'RE NOT

01:16:39.628 --> 01:16:42.564
UNDER GREATLY BECAUSE WE'VE HAD

01:16:42.631 --> 01:16:44.967
MAKES USE MUCH OF THAT SO THESE

01:16:45.033 --> 01:16:46.601
ARE THINGS THAT.

01:16:46.668 --> 01:16:54.843
INVOLVE OUR HOW WOULD YOU SEE

01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:57.045
THOSE SUPPLIED GOING FORWARD.

01:16:57.112 --> 01:16:59.147
SO IN TERMS OF THE JOB BRIDGE

01:16:59.214 --> 01:16:59.514
AREA.

01:16:59.581 --> 01:17:01.450
CATEGORY IN GENERAL -- THE BILL --

01:17:01.516 --> 01:17:02.851
REQUIRES EACH CD AND TWENTY

01:17:02.918 --> 01:17:03.919
TWENTY AND THEN EVERY FIVE YEARS

01:17:03.986 --> 01:17:05.954
THEREAFTER TO PUBLISH -- THOSE

01:17:06.021 --> 01:17:08.290
MAPS SO IT WILL BE UPDATED.

01:17:08.357 --> 01:17:11.460
ON EVERY FIVE EVERY FIVE YEARS

01:17:11.526 --> 01:17:13.895
THROUGH EACH COMMUNITY. FIVE THE

01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:15.530
CITY WAS YOUR MAP FOR THE ENTIRE

01:17:15.597 --> 01:17:18.033
STATE -- THAT WAS CHAU WHAT

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:21.837
QUALIFIES AS A JOB RICH OUR

01:17:21.903 --> 01:17:22.871
COMMUNITY.

01:17:22.938 --> 01:17:24.306
UNDER HEIR STANDARDS THAT

01:17:24.373 --> 01:17:25.841
THEY'RE LOOKING OUT FOR THAT YES

01:17:25.907 --> 01:17:27.342
AND THOSE ARE THE BILL CONTAINS

01:17:27.409 --> 01:17:29.845
ENUMERATION -- AND THEY'RE ALSO

01:17:29.911 --> 01:17:31.380
THERE ARE METHODOLOGIES THAT THE

01:17:31.446 --> 01:17:32.748
STATE HAS EMPLOYED.

01:17:32.814 --> 01:17:35.884
IN THE PAST AROUND -- THIS ISSUE

01:17:35.951 --> 01:17:38.020
SO THIS IS NOT -- RECREATING THE

01:17:38.086 --> 01:17:39.488
WHEEL FROM SCRATCH ALTHOUGH OF

01:17:39.554 --> 01:17:41.356
COURSE HAVE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS

01:17:41.423 --> 01:17:43.125
TO CONFORM THE BILL BUT THEY'VE

01:17:43.191 --> 01:17:45.827
DONE THIS KIND OF WORK -- BEFORE

01:17:45.894 --> 01:17:47.662
SO IT'S NOT BRAND NEW IN IS NOT

01:17:47.729 --> 01:17:49.931
ARBITRARY FELT WHAT ARBITRARY IT

01:17:49.998 --> 01:17:51.666
IS DEFINITELY NOT ARBITRARY THEN

01:17:51.733 --> 01:17:53.335
SECOND ITEM IS UNDER THE

01:17:53.402 --> 01:17:55.137
CONCESSIONS THAT ARE GRANTED I

01:17:55.203 --> 01:17:56.405
THINK YOU SAID.

01:17:56.471 --> 01:17:57.706
THE SETBACKS WOULD NOT BE

01:17:57.773 --> 01:17:59.708
AFFECTED YEAH THE CONCESSIONS

01:17:59.775 --> 01:18:01.610
THAT ARE GRANTED THERE'S THREE

01:18:01.676 --> 01:18:02.944
ADDITIONAL ONES UNDER THE

01:18:03.011 --> 01:18:04.946
CURRENT DENSITY BONUS LAW IN ONE

01:18:05.013 --> 01:18:06.648
OF THOSE IS A REDUCTION AND SITE

01:18:06.715 --> 01:18:08.683
DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.

01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:09.851
ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN

01:18:09.918 --> 01:18:11.787
REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING SET BACK

01:18:11.853 --> 01:18:13.789
AND I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER

01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:15.857
SIGNIFICANT ISSUE AND THAT WOULD

01:18:15.924 --> 01:18:17.726
BE GRANTED HAS AN ADDITIONAL

01:18:17.793 --> 01:18:20.362
CONCESSION ACCORDING TO USING

01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:26.501
THE EXISTING DENSITY BONUS LIE

01:18:26.568 --> 01:18:28.403
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT.

01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:29.805
WELL THE THE DENSITY BONUSES

01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:31.006
EXISTING LAW YEAH HAS ITS

01:18:31.073 --> 01:18:32.908
PROVISIONS -- AND WE'RE NOT

01:18:32.974 --> 01:18:33.442
CHANGING.

01:18:33.508 --> 01:18:34.876
WHAT THE DENSITY BONUS --

01:18:34.943 --> 01:18:36.011
PROVIDES BUT IT IS THAT IT

01:18:36.078 --> 01:18:37.312
WOULDN'T AFFECT SET BACKS AND

01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:39.481
THIS WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT COULD

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:39.881
AFFECT.

01:18:39.948 --> 01:18:41.817
SET BACKS IF THEY ARE GRANTED

01:18:41.883 --> 01:18:43.452
ANOTHER CONCESSION UNDER SOMEONE

01:18:43.518 --> 01:18:45.253
INVOKES THE DENSITY BONUS BUT

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.988
THEY CAN INVOKE DENSITY BONUS ON

01:18:47.055 --> 01:18:50.459
AFFECTS UP BOX TODAY.

01:18:50.525 --> 01:18:53.462
YEAH.

01:18:53.528 --> 01:18:54.629
SO THEN IT'S NOT.

01:18:54.696 --> 01:18:57.165
CONSISTENT THAT YOUR CURRENT

01:18:57.232 --> 01:18:58.834
BILL WOULD NOT A FAX SETBACK.

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:00.168
REQUIREMENTS PUT ON OR SOMEHING

01:19:00.235 --> 01:19:03.738
BY A SB FIFTY ITSELF -- DOES NOT.

01:19:03.805 --> 01:19:04.873
OVERRIDE SAID THERE IS A NARROW

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:06.575
CATEGORY OF IF THERE'S SOME

01:19:06.641 --> 01:19:07.809
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE.

01:19:07.876 --> 01:19:08.743
WHAT WE MIGHT CALL ABUSIVE

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:10.245
SETBACKS ARE DESIGNED TO MAKE IT

01:19:10.312 --> 01:19:12.214
IMPOSSIBLE TO BUILD ANYTHING

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:13.982
RIGHT PUTTING THAT ASIDE --

01:19:14.049 --> 01:19:16.118
SETBACKS ON OR NOT OVER WRITTEN

01:19:16.184 --> 01:19:18.053
IN THIS BILL BUT THE DENSITY

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:19.921
BONUS EXISTING STATE DENSITY

01:19:19.988 --> 01:19:22.524
BONUS PROGRAM THE TIME IMPACT

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:23.492
SETBACKS.

01:19:23.558 --> 01:19:24.693
AND WE'RE NOT CHANGING WHAT THE

01:19:24.759 --> 01:19:28.597
DENSITY BONUS -- PROVIDES OUR

01:19:28.663 --> 01:19:29.464
ALLOWANCE.

01:19:29.531 --> 01:19:31.266
BETTER SAID YOUR BILL DOESN'T

01:19:31.333 --> 01:19:33.969
ADD.

01:19:34.035 --> 01:19:34.569
TO WHAT'S CURRENTLY GIVEN AND

01:19:34.636 --> 01:19:34.970
LAW.

01:19:35.036 --> 01:19:36.204
IT DOESN'T GIVE ALL AROUND

01:19:36.271 --> 01:19:38.540
DENSITY AND IN SOME SITUATIONS

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:39.474
HIGH AND IT DOES THAT ARE THERE

01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:42.010
THAT WE DO IN SOME RESPECTS.

01:19:42.077 --> 01:19:43.912
BUT PERCENT X. IT WOULD BE THE

01:19:43.979 --> 01:19:50.919
DENSITY BONUS SECOND IMPACTS UP

01:19:50.986 --> 01:19:52.988
BOX.

01:19:53.054 --> 01:19:54.089
I'M NOT YOUR BILL NOT IT'S

01:19:54.156 --> 01:19:55.524
BECAUSE THE BUT IF SOMEONE

01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:57.125
INVOKES THE DENSITY BONUS.

01:19:57.192 --> 01:19:59.828
BEN DATE BACK AND IMPACTS THAT

01:19:59.895 --> 01:20:01.096
BOX BUT THAT IS A LOT TODAY.

01:20:01.163 --> 01:20:02.297
OKAY THAT'S GOING A LITTLE

01:20:02.364 --> 01:20:03.331
CONFUSED ON THAT ONE FINALLY ON

01:20:03.398 --> 01:20:04.866
THE JOHN GENTRIFICATION.

01:20:04.933 --> 01:20:06.268
ISSUE ARE CERTAINLY AND ARE LOS

01:20:06.334 --> 01:20:08.069
ANGELES AREA SO I'M VERY

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:08.637
FAMILIAR WITH HAVING BEEN A

01:20:08.703 --> 01:20:08.970
FORMER ALSO.

01:20:09.037 --> 01:20:10.005
FORMER SOCIAL WORKER A LOT OF

01:20:10.071 --> 01:20:11.373
THE PROJECTS -- AND THE LOWER

01:20:11.439 --> 01:20:13.308
INCOME HOUSING AND SOME OF OUR

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:15.844
SOUTH PHILLY AREAS DO LIE AND

01:20:15.911 --> 01:20:16.611
THE VERY ARE ALL.

01:20:16.678 --> 01:20:18.747
GREAT TRANSIT AREAS A JOB RICH

01:20:18.813 --> 01:20:20.582
AREAS BECAUSE ARE CLOSE TO YOU --

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:22.951
TRANSIT AND BUS SERVICE SO I

01:20:23.018 --> 01:20:24.653
THINK THAT THE ISSUES BROUGHT UP

01:20:24.719 --> 01:20:25.820
BY THOSE WHO ARE VERY CONCERNED

01:20:25.887 --> 01:20:27.422
ARE VERY REAL AND KNOWING THAT

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:28.223
YOU'RE GOING.

01:20:28.290 --> 01:20:30.225
TO TAKE A DEEPER -- LOOK AT THAT

01:20:30.292 --> 01:20:32.494
IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

01:20:32.561 --> 01:20:34.462
THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING AND

01:20:34.529 --> 01:20:36.698
SOMETIMES BECOMES ALMOST THE THE

01:20:36.765 --> 01:20:44.472
MOTIVATION -- FOR THOSE PROJECTS

01:20:44.539 --> 01:20:46.541
TO COME FORWARD SO.

01:20:46.608 --> 01:20:48.376
I'M JUST SAYING THAT THAT WOULD

01:20:48.443 --> 01:20:49.344
BE ANOTHER CONCERN OF MINE --

01:20:49.411 --> 01:20:50.845
HAVING WALKED THE BOX MANY YEARS

01:20:50.912 --> 01:20:51.179
AGO.

01:20:51.246 --> 01:20:51.913
THIS COULD DISPLACE LARGE

01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:53.048
POPULATIONS OVER THE COURSE OF

01:20:53.114 --> 01:20:55.817
THE SEVEN YEARS OR EVEN BEYOND.

01:20:55.884 --> 01:20:58.053
SO I'M CENTER MAY I I REALLY I I

01:20:58.119 --> 01:21:00.722
APPRECIATE THAT COMMENT AND I

01:21:00.789 --> 01:21:02.724
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT --

01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:05.493
TO TALK ABOUT GENTRIFICATION AND

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:07.062
WHAT CAUSES GENTRIFICATION.

01:21:07.128 --> 01:21:08.196
I LIVE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD CALLED

01:21:08.263 --> 01:21:10.198
THE CASTRO IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT

01:21:10.265 --> 01:21:11.333
HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT

01:21:11.399 --> 01:21:13.635
GENTRIFICATION ILIVE ABOUT FIVE

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:15.737
BLOCKS AWAY FROM THE WESTERN

01:21:15.804 --> 01:21:17.239
EDGE OF THE MISSION.

01:21:17.305 --> 01:21:18.873
WHICH HAS EXPERIENCED FOR THE

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:21.643
LAST -- YOU KNOW GOING BACK AT

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:24.546
LEAST FIFTY YEARS SIGNIFICANT --

01:21:24.613 --> 01:21:26.548
GENTRIFICATION WITH THOUSANDS

01:21:26.615 --> 01:21:29.084
AND THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES ARE

01:21:29.150 --> 01:21:30.752
BEING PUSHED OUT.

01:21:30.819 --> 01:21:32.087
AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT

01:21:32.153 --> 01:21:34.756
CAUSES GENTRIFICATION AND IT'S A

01:21:34.823 --> 01:21:37.325
COMPLICATED ISSUE BUT ONE OF THE

01:21:37.392 --> 01:21:39.027
ONE OF THE MAIN FACTORS ARE

01:21:39.094 --> 01:21:40.362
CAUSES GENTRIFICATION

01:21:40.428 --> 01:21:42.230
DISPLACEMENT.

01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:44.466
IS NOT HAVING ENOUGH HOUSING.

01:21:44.532 --> 01:21:45.800
FIVE AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE

01:21:45.867 --> 01:21:47.269
ENOUGH HOUSING IT EXPLODES

01:21:47.335 --> 01:21:49.571
HOUSING COSTS AND PEOPLE GET

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:50.672
PUSHED OUT.

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:51.973
WE HAD A HUGE FIGHT SAN

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.608
FRANCISCO -- HEARD ABOUT THE

01:21:53.675 --> 01:21:55.010
MISSION BEFORE WE HAD A HUGE

01:21:55.076 --> 01:21:56.845
FIGHT ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO ABOUT

01:21:56.911 --> 01:21:59.214
AN EFFORT TO PUT A MORATORIUM ON

01:21:59.281 --> 01:22:00.915
HOUSING IN PLACE IN THE NATION --

01:22:00.982 --> 01:22:03.118
BECAUSE OF A CONCERN THAT NEW

01:22:03.184 --> 01:22:05.453
DEVELOPMENT WAS UP CAUSING

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:07.322
GENTRIFICATION PUSHING PEOPLE

01:22:07.389 --> 01:22:07.956
OUT.

01:22:08.023 --> 01:22:09.391
WHAT TURNS OUT THAT AT THAT

01:22:09.457 --> 01:22:11.893
MOMENT IN TIME AS OF AROUND

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:12.460
TWENTY FIFTEEN FOR THE LAST

01:22:12.527 --> 01:22:14.863
DECADE OR SO THE MISSION HAD

01:22:14.929 --> 01:22:16.264
SEEN ONE OF THE LOWEST?

01:22:16.331 --> 01:22:18.500
NUMBER OF NEW HOUSING BEING

01:22:18.566 --> 01:22:20.168
ADDED IT WAS TOWARDS THE BOTTOM

01:22:20.235 --> 01:22:21.870
OF THE LIST AND SAN FRANCISCO IN

01:22:21.936 --> 01:22:23.071
TERMS OF NUMBER OF NEW UNITS OUT

01:22:23.138 --> 01:22:24.472
OF VERY LITTLE NEW.

01:22:24.539 --> 01:22:25.507
DEVELOPMENT HAD ACTUALLY

01:22:25.573 --> 01:22:27.342
HAPPENED IN THE MISSION THERE

01:22:27.409 --> 01:22:28.777
WAS PLANS FOR THE FUTURE.

01:22:28.843 --> 01:22:29.711
VERY LITTLE HAD HAPPENED YET

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:31.880
THAT MISSION WAS EXPERIENCING

01:22:31.946 --> 01:22:33.782
TERRIBLE DISPLACEMENT.

01:22:33.848 --> 01:22:35.150
AND GENTRIFICATION TO THIS

01:22:35.216 --> 01:22:37.252
NOTION THAT IT'S NEW

01:22:37.319 --> 01:22:39.154
DEVELOPMENTS IN NEW HOUSING THAT

01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:42.057
IS CAUSING DISPLACEMENT -- WHILE

01:22:42.123 --> 01:22:43.725
OF COURSE WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:44.926
IF YOU START ALLOWING PEOPLE TO

01:22:44.993 --> 01:22:46.328
START TEARING DOWN EVICTING

01:22:46.394 --> 01:22:48.430
PEOPLE IN TEARING DOWN BUILDINGS

01:22:48.496 --> 01:22:50.165
YES THAT IS DISPLACEMENT AND WE

01:22:50.231 --> 01:22:51.733
TRY TO PROTECT AGAINST SIDE.

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:54.636
IN THIS BILL -- BUT WHAT THE

01:22:54.703 --> 01:22:56.271
HEART OF DISPLACEMENT IS

01:22:56.338 --> 01:22:58.907
EXPLOSIVE HOUSING COSTS BECAUSE

01:22:58.973 --> 01:23:00.875
IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST

01:23:00.942 --> 01:23:01.843
FIFTY YEARS WE HAVE MADE IT

01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:03.411
IMPOSSIBLE TO BUILD ENOUGH

01:23:03.478 --> 01:23:05.714
HOUSING. FOR A GROWING STATE

01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:06.815
WE'RE PRETTY WE'RE ACTING LIKE

01:23:06.881 --> 01:23:07.916
WE'RE STILL A STATE OF TEN

01:23:07.982 --> 01:23:09.684
MILLION PEOPLE WHEN WE'RE STATE

01:23:09.751 --> 01:23:11.519
OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE --

01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:13.855
HEADING TOWARDS FIFTY MILLION --

01:23:13.922 --> 01:23:16.057
AND SO -- THE ONE OF THE MOST

01:23:16.124 --> 01:23:17.625
SIGNIFICANT THINGS WE CAN DO IN

01:23:17.692 --> 01:23:19.527
ADDITION TO TENER PROTECTIONS TO

01:23:19.594 --> 01:23:21.096
REDUCE DISPLACEMENT IS TO

01:23:21.162 --> 01:23:22.764
ACTUALLY ALLOW ENOUGH HOUSING

01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:23.264
FOR EVERYONE THAT'S MY

01:23:23.331 --> 01:23:25.467
PERSPECTIVE ON THANK YOU THANK

01:23:25.533 --> 01:23:26.668

YOU FOR YOUR YOUR EFFORTS THANK

01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:36.411
AND ALTHOUGH THE ON GOING.

01:23:36.478 --> 01:23:38.079
AND MORLOCK THANK YOU MISTER

01:23:38.146 --> 01:23:39.547
CHAIR OF SEVERE WINTER JUST WHEN

01:23:39.614 --> 01:23:40.515
I GET BACK TO IT.

01:23:40.582 --> 01:23:41.816
A LITTLE DIFFERENT TOPIC.

01:23:41.883 --> 01:23:43.718
BECAUSE YOUR YOUR WHOLE PREMISE

01:23:43.785 --> 01:23:45.453
IS BASED ON TRANSIT ANTI WANNA

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.622
TALK ABOUT TRANSIT A LITTLE BIT --

01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:48.623
I'M I COME FROM A SCHOOL WHERE

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:49.257
YOU YOU KNOW THE TREND IS YOUR

01:23:49.324 --> 01:23:49.791
FRIEND.

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:50.759
AND AND WE'RE SEEING TRANSIT

01:23:50.825 --> 01:23:52.160
DECLINE WE'RE SEEING LIKE A 40%

01:23:52.227 --> 01:23:53.495
46% REDUCTION IN LA AND OTHER

01:23:53.561 --> 01:23:54.929
AREAS.

01:23:54.996 --> 01:23:56.164
THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION

01:23:56.231 --> 01:23:57.565
AUTHORITY SING BROKE BUS

01:23:57.632 --> 01:23:59.033
RIDERSHIP DECLINED.

01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:01.236
RATHER DRAMATICALLY UP TO THE

01:24:01.302 --> 01:24:02.937
POINT WHERE IT'S ALMOST.

01:24:03.004 --> 01:24:03.571
YOU KNOW YOU GOT IT CAN I DO A

01:24:03.638 --> 01:24:05.440
COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS KIND OF

01:24:05.507 --> 01:24:06.741
STUDY ON WHETHER IT'S STILL.

01:24:06.808 --> 01:24:09.010
WORTH PURSUING SO PEOPLE ARE

01:24:09.077 --> 01:24:11.479
UING WHAT WITH THEIR UBER OR

01:24:11.546 --> 01:24:12.213
NEVER GOT.

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:14.115
AN AGE OF SELF DRIVING CARS

01:24:14.182 --> 01:24:15.784
WHICH WE WOULD BE PERSONAL RAPID

01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:16.818
TRANSIT.

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:18.186
SO THERE THERE'S LIKE A PUSH

01:24:18.253 --> 01:24:19.721
AWAY FROM.

01:24:19.788 --> 01:24:22.223
TRAINS AND BUSES WHEN A TRAIN

01:24:22.290 --> 01:24:24.426
FAILS EVERYBODY'S YOU KNOW STOCK

01:24:24.492 --> 01:24:25.927
AND THEY CAN.

01:24:25.994 --> 01:24:29.030
DO YOU KNOW THEY'RE JUST STUCK.

01:24:29.097 --> 01:24:30.331
SO I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS.

01:24:30.398 --> 01:24:31.299
IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON ON THOSE

01:24:31.366 --> 01:24:32.634
CONCERNS IT IS IS THIS THE RIGHT

01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:32.934
[inaudible]

01:24:33.001 --> 01:24:34.736
PREMISE [inaudible]

01:24:34.803 --> 01:24:36.438
AND WHY.

01:24:36.504 --> 01:24:39.207
ABSOLUTELY -- I THINK WE WANT TO

01:24:39.274 --> 01:24:40.475
MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO

01:24:40.542 --> 01:24:42.277
LIVE NEAR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION

01:24:42.343 --> 01:24:43.578
UNTIL LIVE NEAR WHERE WITH WITH

01:24:43.645 --> 01:24:45.847
NEAR WHERE THEY WORK -- AS A

01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:48.917
MATTER OF ENVIRONMENT AS A

01:24:48.983 --> 01:24:50.485
MATTER OF NOT FORCING PEOPLE TO

01:24:50.552 --> 01:24:51.786
COMMUTE TWO HOURS.

01:24:51.853 --> 01:24:54.289
AS IT'S JUST A MATTER OF HAVING --

01:24:54.355 --> 01:24:55.490
HEALTHIER FAMILIES SO PEOPLE

01:24:55.557 --> 01:24:57.258
AREN'T GETTING HOME AT NINE

01:24:57.325 --> 01:24:58.626
O'CLOCK AT NIGHT WHEN THEIR KIDS

01:24:58.693 --> 01:25:00.261
ARE ALREADY IN BED BECAUSE THEY

01:25:00.328 --> 01:25:00.895
JUST HAD A TWO AND A HALF HOUR

01:25:00.962 --> 01:25:03.465
COMMUTE -- SO I I DO THINK THE

01:25:03.531 --> 01:25:04.766
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.

01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:06.901
IS A VERY APPROPRIATE WAY OF

01:25:06.968 --> 01:25:08.269
DETERMINING WHERE YOU SHOULD

01:25:08.336 --> 01:25:10.305
HAVE A MORE HOUSING -- BECAUSE

01:25:10.371 --> 01:25:11.773
ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:12.640
TO DRIVE YOU WANT TO GIVE THESE

01:25:12.707 --> 01:25:15.310
GIVE PEOPLE THE OPTION NOT TO

01:25:15.376 --> 01:25:15.543
DRIVE.

01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:18.680
ON NOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT AND

01:25:18.746 --> 01:25:19.347
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

01:25:19.414 --> 01:25:22.016
SOME OF THE DECLINING RATES OF

01:25:22.083 --> 01:25:23.885
TRANSIT USAGE THERE ARE AGAINST

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:25.286
COMPLICATED THERE'S NO ONE

01:25:25.353 --> 01:25:29.424
REASON -- ONE OF THOSE REASONS --

01:25:29.491 --> 01:25:29.958
WE SEE WE KNOW THE TRANSIT

01:25:30.024 --> 01:25:31.526
RIDERSHIP IS IS GOING TO

01:25:31.593 --> 01:25:33.828
STRUGGLE IF YOU DON'T ALLOW

01:25:33.895 --> 01:25:35.163
DENSITY.

01:25:35.230 --> 01:25:37.699
AROUND THOSE TRANSIT PODS --

01:25:37.765 --> 01:25:40.668
BECAUSE IF PEOPLE CAN'T LIVE

01:25:40.735 --> 01:25:42.170
NEAR WHERE THE TRANSIT AS THEIR

01:25:42.237 --> 01:25:44.706
VERY MUCH LESS LIKELY TO USE IT --

01:25:44.772 --> 01:25:45.974
WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE NEED TO

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:48.376
MAKE IT EASIER FOR LOW INCOME

01:25:48.443 --> 01:25:50.378
PEOPLE TO LIVE NEAR TRANSIT --

01:25:50.445 --> 01:25:52.780
LOW INCOME PEOPLE ARE -- THE

01:25:52.847 --> 01:25:54.916
MOST LIKELY OUR WRITERS OF

01:25:54.983 --> 01:25:57.051
TRANSIT -- AND THAT'S TRUE IN A

01:25:57.118 --> 01:25:59.120
LOT OF AREAS ALTHOUGH THERE ARE

01:25:59.187 --> 01:26:00.588
ALSO AREAS WHERE THERE'S A LOT

01:26:00.655 --> 01:26:02.624
OF YOU KNOW BOTH MIDDLE CLASS

01:26:02.690 --> 01:26:03.958
AND LOWER INCOME PEOPLE USING

01:26:04.025 --> 01:26:05.994
TRANSIT -- BUT IF YOU DO WHAT

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:07.095
WE'VE DONE.

01:26:07.161 --> 01:26:09.564
IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS TO SAY IN

01:26:09.631 --> 01:26:10.832
A LARGE MAJORITY OF PLACES WERE

01:26:10.899 --> 01:26:12.500
ONLY GOING TO ALLOW SINGLE

01:26:12.567 --> 01:26:13.368
FAMILY HOMES.

01:26:13.434 --> 01:26:15.003
MAKES IT REALLY HARD FOR PEOPLE

01:26:15.069 --> 01:26:18.172
OF LOWER MEANS LOWER INCOME --

01:26:18.239 --> 01:26:19.207
TO TO BE ABLE TO LIVE NEAR THAT

01:26:19.274 --> 01:26:21.409
TRANSIT AND SO IT'S REALLY HARD

01:26:21.476 --> 01:26:22.176
FOR THEM TO USE THAT THEY CAN'T

01:26:22.243 --> 01:26:22.977
WALK THERE.

01:26:23.044 --> 01:26:24.012
THEN YOU HAVE TO DRIVE TO

01:26:24.078 --> 01:26:25.880
TRANSIT WHICH IS VERY.

01:26:25.947 --> 01:26:27.715
CAN BE VERY HARD -- SO I I THINK

01:26:27.782 --> 01:26:29.951
WE HAVE TO RECOMMIT TO IMPROVING

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:32.387
OUR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION -- TO

01:26:32.453 --> 01:26:34.188
MAKE IT EASIER AND SAFER AND

01:26:34.255 --> 01:26:43.131
CLEANER FOR PEOPLE TO RIDE IT

01:26:43.197 --> 01:26:45.733
AND AND ADDING PEOPLE ACTUALLY

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:46.334
HAVE A SHOT AT LIVING CLOSE TO

01:26:46.401 --> 01:26:48.036
IT.

01:26:48.102 --> 01:26:48.736
THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER

01:26:48.803 --> 01:26:49.637

BILLS I DO APOLOGIZE SIR.

01:27:13.094 --> 01:27:14.262

SPEND ENOUGH TIME AND HOUSING

01:28:55.963 --> 01:28:57.498
POLICY YOU CAN SEE FROM THE

01:28:57.565 --> 01:28:58.566
PUBLIC CONFIDENCE THE VERY

01:28:58.633 --> 01:29:00.702
DIVERSE PUBLIC COMMENT TODAY

01:29:00.768 --> 01:29:04.639
SPANNING THE ENTIRE -- SPECTRUM --

01:29:07.108 --> 01:29:09.377

RUN THE ENTIRE GAMUT ON IT'S

01:29:18.086 --> 01:29:19.020
IT'S NOT.

01:29:19.087 --> 01:29:21.155
SURPRISING THAT IT'S HARD. TO

01:29:21.222 --> 01:29:22.623

HOUSING THE VERY VERY HARD THING

01:29:24.992 --> 01:29:26.194
I THINK THE ONLY THING THAT

01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:27.128
MIGHT BE HARDER IS LIKE TAX

ARE NEEDED TO ENABLE ADDITIONAL

01:35:22.016 --> 01:35:26.187
AFFORDABLE AND MARK RATE HOUSING

01:35:26.253 --> 01:35:26.520
CONSTRUCTION.

01:35:26.587 --> 01:35:27.855
AND HERE'S WHAT WE NOW.

01:35:27.922 --> 01:35:28.856
WHAT WE KNOW IS AFTER THE SERIES

01:35:28.923 --> 01:35:29.457
OF MEETINGS AND NOW IT DIDN'T

BUT HEARING THE INPUT WAS

01:35:33.427 --> 01:35:34.228
IMPORTANT.

01:35:34.295 --> 01:35:36.297
WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT?

01:35:36.363 --> 01:35:37.898
CALIFORNIANS FACED WITH A SERIES

01:35:37.965 --> 01:35:40.134
OF COMPLEX CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED

01:35:40.201 --> 01:35:42.103
WITH THE BUILD OUT OF HOUSING.

01:35:42.169 --> 01:35:43.537
WHETHER IT'S HIGH LAND PRICES.

01:35:43.604 --> 01:35:45.873
THE LACK OF HOUSING STOCK

01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:48.309
ASSOCIATED WITH GROWING DEMAND.

01:35:48.375 --> 01:35:49.410
THE LACK OF AN ONGOING

SUSTAINABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:35:51.145 --> 01:35:52.580

I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT

01:36:04.492 --> 01:36:05.926
IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME TO BE ABLE

01:36:05.993 --> 01:36:07.061
TO BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF THIS

01:36:07.128 --> 01:36:08.329
SIGNIFICANT DEFICIT THAT'S

01:36:08.395 --> 01:36:09.463
FACING US.

01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:11.198
WE MUST HAVE A LASER FOCUS A

CORNER OF CALIFORNIA.

01:36:18.739 --> 01:36:20.875

THE STATE NEEDS TO STEP UP.

01:36:36.757 --> 01:36:37.925
AND WE NEED TO BE A TO DEVELOP A

01:36:37.992 --> 01:36:39.193

01:36:49.136 --> 01:36:51.205
FIVE WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IS EVERY

01:36:51.272 --> 01:36:53.641
SITTING COUNTY THE GOLDEN STATE

01:36:53.707 --> 01:36:54.175
NEED TO DO THEIR PART WITH

01:36:54.241 --> 01:36:55.409
HOUSING.

01:36:55.476 --> 01:36:57.111
AND THE STRATEGY OF SAYING NO TO

01:36:57.178 --> 01:36:58.712
HOUSING.

01:36:58.779 --> 01:37:01.849
NO LONGER WORKS.

01:37:01.916 --> 01:37:03.717
AT THE SAME TIME WE KNOW THAT WE

01:37:03.784 --> 01:37:04.818
NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE

01:37:04.885 --> 01:37:06.120
UNIQUE DIFFERENCES OF

01:37:06.187 --> 01:37:08.255
JURISDICTIONS BECAUSE A BLANKET

01:37:08.322 --> 01:37:09.924
ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH.

01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:11.892
SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK EITHER.

01:37:11.959 --> 01:37:13.460
AND THAT'S WHY WERE HERE BEFORE

01:37:13.527 --> 01:37:15.663
YOU TODAY WITH SENATE BILL.

01:37:15.729 --> 01:37:17.831
FOR SENATE BILL FOR ADVANCES.

01:37:17.898 --> 01:37:19.200
THOUGHTFUL STRATEGIES THAT WILL

01:37:19.266 --> 01:37:20.201
HELP ADDRESS THE AFFORDABLE

01:37:20.267 --> 01:37:22.836
HOUSING CRISIS IN BIG CITIES AND

01:37:22.903 --> 01:37:24.638
SMALL ACROSS THE GOLDEN STATE.

01:37:24.705 --> 01:37:26.073
WITH THE RECENT AMENDMENTS THAT

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:27.942
WE RECENTLY ADVANCED.

01:37:28.008 --> 01:37:29.743
THIS BILL HITS 90% OF THE

01:37:29.810 --> 01:37:31.545
STATE'S POPULATION.

01:37:31.612 --> 01:37:33.147
BRIEFLY HERE THE GUTS OF THIS

01:37:33.214 --> 01:37:34.748
BEFORE.

01:37:34.815 --> 01:37:36.383
IN COMMUNITIES WITH FIFTY

01:37:36.450 --> 01:37:38.686
THOUSAND POPULATION IN A NUMBER

01:37:38.752 --> 01:37:39.987

01:37:45.059 --> 01:37:46.560
SHALL BE ONE STORY ADDITIONAL

01:37:46.627 --> 01:37:47.561
HEIGHT.

01:37:47.628 --> 01:37:50.331
ABOVE WHAT IS CURRENTLY ZONED.

01:37:50.397 --> 01:37:52.633
PLUS VINCENT DENSITY BONUS BY

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:54.668
RIGHT AROUND RAIL AND FERRY

01:37:54.735 --> 01:37:55.436
STATIONS.

01:37:55.502 --> 01:37:56.870
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LIVE IN A

01:37:56.937 --> 01:37:58.739
COMMUNITY THAT ALLOWS FOR THREE

01:37:58.806 --> 01:38:00.107
STORIES.

01:38:00.174 --> 01:38:02.009
YOU AUTOMATICALLY RECEIVE A FOUR

01:38:02.076 --> 01:38:03.177

01:38:03.244 --> 01:38:04.812
BY RIGHT.

01:38:04.878 --> 01:38:06.647
AND THE MAXIM BUILD OUT ON THAT

01:38:06.714 --> 01:38:07.781
LOT.

01:38:07.848 --> 01:38:09.817

01:38:14.255 --> 01:38:15.089
HOUSING IN THE COASTAL ZONE

01:38:15.155 --> 01:38:17.124
HISTORIC DISTRICT IN HIGH FIRE

01:38:17.191 --> 01:38:17.758
HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES WOULD BE

01:38:17.825 --> 01:38:18.692
EXCLUDED.

01:38:18.759 --> 01:38:22.096
BUT AGAIN THIS BILL HITS 90% OF

01:38:22.162 --> 01:38:23.397
THE POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA.

01:38:23.464 --> 01:38:25.699
BY RIGHT APPROVAL OF FOR PLEXUS

01:38:25.766 --> 01:38:27.401
WOULD ALSO BE ALLOWED.

01:38:27.468 --> 01:38:29.270
IN THESE BY RIGHT APPROVAL FOR

01:38:29.336 --> 01:38:30.671
PLEXUS WILL SPREAD OUT DEAN

01:38:30.738 --> 01:38:31.505
SITTING COMMUNITIES WITH A

01:38:31.572 --> 01:38:33.440
POPULATION OF FIFTY THOUSAND OR

01:38:33.507 --> 01:38:33.941
MORE.

01:38:34.008 --> 01:38:35.943
BY RIGHT APPROVAL OF DUPLEXES TO

01:38:36.010 --> 01:38:37.444
SPREAD OUT INTO NEW COMMUNITIES

01:38:37.511 --> 01:38:39.580
WITH A POPULATION OF FIFTY

01:38:39.647 --> 01:38:40.114
THOUSAND OR LESS WOULD BE

01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:41.148
ALLOWED.

01:38:41.215 --> 01:38:42.249
WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE OF

01:38:42.316 --> 01:38:44.718
PARKING IN CITIES OVER?

01:38:44.785 --> 01:38:45.352
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND NO PARKING

01:38:45.419 --> 01:38:46.887
WITHIN A QUARTER MILE OF A

01:38:46.954 --> 01:38:48.355
PASSENGER RAIL OR FERRY TERMINAL.

01:38:48.422 --> 01:38:50.157
POINT FIVE PARKING SPOTS WITHIN

01:38:50.224 --> 01:38:52.159
A QUARTER MILE TO A HALF MILE

01:38:52.226 --> 01:38:54.728
CITIES UNDER A HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:38:54.795 --> 01:38:56.297
POINT FIVE PARKING SPOTS WITHIN

01:38:56.363 --> 01:38:58.999
A HALF MILE FROM PASSENGER RAIL.

01:38:59.066 --> 01:38:59.800
AS WELL AS PASSENGER FERRY.

01:38:59.867 --> 01:39:01.502
WE KNOW THE GREATEST NEED FOR

01:39:01.568 --> 01:39:03.003
HOUSING IS THE LOWEST IN THE

01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:04.338
ECONOMICS SPECTRUM.

01:39:04.405 --> 01:39:07.207
THAT'S WHY SB FOUR ALSO HAS A

01:39:07.274 --> 01:39:08.642
30% ON SITE INCLUSION A

01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:09.810
REQUIREMENT.

01:39:09.877 --> 01:39:11.545
INCLUDE STRONG LABOR PROTECTIONS

01:39:11.612 --> 01:39:12.946
ENSURE THAT WORKERS CAN LIVE IN

01:39:13.013 --> 01:39:13.981
THE HOUSING THAT THEY ACTUALLY

01:39:14.048 --> 01:39:15.516
BUILD.

01:39:15.582 --> 01:39:17.818
NOW ALL SAY.

01:39:17.885 --> 01:39:20.120
BUT THIS ISN'T AN EASY BILL.

01:39:20.187 --> 01:39:23.257
I AND CANDIDLY.

01:39:23.324 --> 01:39:25.059
WE HAVE HAD OUR SHARE.

01:39:25.125 --> 01:39:27.294
OF FOLKS WHO HAVE SAID THIS IS

01:39:27.361 --> 01:39:29.630
TOO AGGRESSIVE.

01:39:29.697 --> 01:39:31.799
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY.

01:39:31.865 --> 01:39:34.468
EVERY COMMUNITY MUST SEE CHANGE.

01:39:34.535 --> 01:39:36.704
SB FOUR PROVIDES A PATH FORWARD

01:39:36.770 --> 01:39:37.938
FOR CATALYZING THAT CHANGE.

01:39:38.005 --> 01:39:39.340
WITHOUT EARNING OVER EVERY

01:39:39.406 --> 01:39:42.276
DIFFERENCE IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES.

01:39:42.343 --> 01:39:43.944
WOULD LIKE TO BE TO TURN IT OVER.

01:39:44.011 --> 01:39:46.347
TO SENATOR BAIL TO BE ABLE TO

01:39:46.413 --> 01:39:48.949
OFFER COMMENTS AS WELL.

01:39:49.016 --> 01:39:51.452
MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I SUPPORT --

01:39:51.518 --> 01:39:52.686
TO AND I'M PROUD TO CALL AFTER

01:39:52.753 --> 01:39:54.888
THIS BILL THIS THIS BILL --

01:39:54.955 --> 01:39:57.424
PROVIDES -- IS SOONER MCGUIRE

01:39:57.491 --> 01:40:00.928
INDICATED -- CABLE THE RESULT OF

01:40:00.994 --> 01:40:02.796
THE HEARINGS THAT WERE CONDUCTED --

01:40:02.863 --> 01:40:05.532
IN IN THE STATE LAST FALL AND

01:40:05.599 --> 01:40:11.171
PREPARING -- US FOR A APPROACH

01:40:11.238 --> 01:40:15.242
THAT GIVES FLEXIBILITY. TO THE

01:40:15.309 --> 01:40:18.112
CONCEPT OF INCREASING DENSITY IN

01:40:18.178 --> 01:40:20.514
A WAY HERE -- ALL CITIES CAN

01:40:20.581 --> 01:40:23.517
PARTICIPATE WHETHER -- OF SMALL

01:40:23.584 --> 01:40:28.756
MEDIUM OR LARGE SIZE COMMUNITIES --

01:40:28.822 --> 01:40:31.692
IN TERMS OF MY EXPERIENCE IN.

01:40:31.759 --> 01:40:35.362
IN HOUSING AND REZONING AND OF

01:40:35.429 --> 01:40:37.064
THOSE KINDS ISSUE I DON'T REALLY

01:40:37.131 --> 01:40:39.533
KNOW ANYBODY IN THE LEGISLATORS

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:40.467
DONE MORE.

01:40:40.534 --> 01:40:42.736
APPROVAL OF HOUSING REZONING

01:40:42.803 --> 01:40:45.439
THIS THAT I HAVE IN MY THIRTY

01:40:45.506 --> 01:40:46.707
EIGHT YEARS.

01:40:46.774 --> 01:40:49.276
OF ELECTED PUBLIC SERVICE --

01:40:49.343 --> 01:40:50.611
REPRESENTING THE CITY OF SAN

01:40:50.677 --> 01:40:52.913
JOSE ACTUALLY WAS ON THE

01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:55.249
PLANNING COMMISSION FOR FOUR AND

01:40:55.315 --> 01:40:55.783
A HALF YEARS BEFORE I WAS

01:40:55.849 --> 01:40:56.683
ELECTED.

01:40:56.750 --> 01:41:00.454
SO I UNDERSTAND -- THE FACT THAT --

01:41:00.521 --> 01:41:03.891
REZONING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:41:03.957 --> 01:41:06.393
IS IS REALLY A DIFFICULT THING --

01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:09.696
AND I THINK THAT -- THIS BILL

01:41:09.763 --> 01:41:11.832
PROVIDES WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER

01:41:11.899 --> 01:41:12.666
TO BE.

01:41:12.733 --> 01:41:16.303
A A APPROPRIATE -- AND DIRECT

01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:18.505
INCENTIVE. FOUR BUILDING

01:41:18.572 --> 01:41:20.307
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT CAN'T

01:41:20.374 --> 01:41:21.708
OVERCOME.

01:41:21.775 --> 01:41:27.014
THE INHERENT DISADVANTAGES -- TO

01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:28.482
GOVERNMENT'S MISS WILL

01:41:28.549 --> 01:41:31.185
GOVERNMENTS -- THAT BUILDING

01:41:31.251 --> 01:41:34.254
AFFORDABLE HOUSING HOUSE OF THE

01:41:34.321 --> 01:41:35.889
DISADVANTAGES ARE WELL KNOWN WE

01:41:35.956 --> 01:41:38.058
HAVE A DISADVANTAGE OF IT IN

01:41:38.125 --> 01:41:41.161
TERMS OF TAX.

01:41:41.228 --> 01:41:44.031
REVENUES THAT'S A DISADVANTAGE.

01:41:44.097 --> 01:41:47.000
OF CITIES WOULD MORE LIKELY WANT

01:41:47.067 --> 01:41:49.736
TO BUILD HIGHER COST HOUSING OR

01:41:49.803 --> 01:41:51.738
OTHER LAND USES.

01:41:51.805 --> 01:41:55.042
THAN BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING --

01:41:55.108 --> 01:41:56.710
THE FACT OF MATTER IS THE

01:41:56.777 --> 01:41:58.312
PLANNING TO AS I SAID A LOT OF

01:41:58.378 --> 01:42:01.181
PEOPLE THE PLANNING DIRECTOR

01:42:01.248 --> 01:42:02.749
WORKS FOR THE CITY MANAGER.

01:42:02.816 --> 01:42:04.318
THE CITY MANAGER HAS TO PRESENT

01:42:04.384 --> 01:42:07.154
THE BUDGET. TO THE CITY COUNCIL

01:42:07.221 --> 01:42:08.956
THE CITY COUNCIL HAS TO APPROVE

01:42:09.022 --> 01:42:09.923
A BUDGET.

01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:12.092
WITH POLICE FIRE AND ALL THOSE

01:42:12.159 --> 01:42:14.161
KINDS OF SERVICES SO THERE'S AN

01:42:14.228 --> 01:42:15.996
INHERENT.

01:42:16.063 --> 01:42:18.799
WHAT I CONSIDER CONFLICT

01:42:18.866 --> 01:42:19.099
[inaudible]

01:42:19.166 --> 01:42:21.401
CONFLICT BETWEEN PROVIDING

01:42:21.468 --> 01:42:23.203
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:24.972
ON ONE HAND AND MEETING THE

01:42:25.038 --> 01:42:26.507
NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY IN TERMS

01:42:26.573 --> 01:42:28.475
OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND

01:42:28.542 --> 01:42:30.043
RUNNING AN OPERATED MUNICIPAL

01:42:30.110 --> 01:42:31.879
GOVERNMENT.

01:42:31.945 --> 01:42:33.313
IN TERMS OF BALANCING THE BUDGET

01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:35.015
PREPARING A REVENUE AND

01:42:35.082 --> 01:42:37.784
ESTIMATES -- COLLECTING TAXES

01:42:37.851 --> 01:42:40.621
AND HIRING STAFF AND RUNNING THE

01:42:40.687 --> 01:42:42.956
CITY GOVERNMENT SO I THINK THIS

01:42:43.023 --> 01:42:46.660
BILL THIS BILL -- DOES PROVIDE A

01:42:46.727 --> 01:42:47.861
BALANCE.

01:42:47.928 --> 01:42:50.097
THIS NECESSARY IN COUNTER

01:42:50.163 --> 01:42:52.165
BALANCING THE INHERENT TENDENCY

01:42:52.232 --> 01:42:55.569
OF CITIES. TO SHY AWAY FROM

01:42:55.636 --> 01:42:57.237
BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:42:57.304 --> 01:43:00.674
SO WHEN PEOPLE SAY.

01:43:00.741 --> 01:43:03.210
IT'S A ZONING ONLY PROBLEM IS

01:43:03.277 --> 01:43:04.778
ALSO FISCAL PROBLEM BECAUSE

01:43:04.845 --> 01:43:06.647
CITIES.

01:43:06.713 --> 01:43:08.649
CITIES DO NOT.

01:43:08.715 --> 01:43:10.117
NECESSARILY.

01:43:10.183 --> 01:43:13.453
OF ESPECIALLY THE THE THE

01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:14.588
LEADERS OF THE GOVERNMENT DOES

01:43:14.655 --> 01:43:18.525
NOT NECESSARILY -- CONSIDER --

01:43:18.592 --> 01:43:20.928
THE PRIMARY DUTY TO BUILD

01:43:20.994 --> 01:43:22.362
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:43:22.429 --> 01:43:23.830
IN MY OPINION AND I THINK

01:43:23.897 --> 01:43:25.365
SOMETIMES.

01:43:25.432 --> 01:43:27.768
SOMETIMES -- IT TAKES THE

01:43:27.834 --> 01:43:29.069
LEGISLATURE.

01:43:29.136 --> 01:43:30.704
AS WAS DISCUSSED IN THE LAST

01:43:30.771 --> 01:43:32.306
BILL AND WAS DISCUSSED IN THIS

01:43:32.372 --> 01:43:36.677
BILL. TO SET THE THE THE PRIMARY

01:43:36.743 --> 01:43:38.245
DUTY TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:43:38.312 --> 01:43:40.147
IN CALIFORNIA. TO COUNTER

01:43:40.213 --> 01:43:41.982
BALANCE.

01:43:42.049 --> 01:43:44.418
THAT TENDENCY OF FISCAL

01:43:44.484 --> 01:43:45.953
MANAGEMENT AND CREATING THAT

01:43:46.019 --> 01:43:49.756
FISCAL TAXPAYER BASE -- WE WILL

01:43:49.823 --> 01:43:50.891
ATTEMPT TO DO THAT WITH OUR

01:43:50.958 --> 01:43:52.593
HOUSING BILLS.

01:43:52.659 --> 01:43:54.461
WE MUST DO THAT AND IT'S GOING

01:43:54.528 --> 01:43:56.563
TO BE A A NECESSITY IF WE'RE

01:43:56.630 --> 01:43:57.998
GOING TO PROVIDE.

01:43:58.065 --> 01:44:01.101
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA.

01:44:01.168 --> 01:44:02.836
AND THANK YOU I'LL BE HAPPY TO

01:44:02.903 --> 01:44:06.039
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON THE BILL.

01:44:06.106 --> 01:44:07.040
THANK YOU SO MUCH AND ABOUT

RESPECT TO THE CONTINUE

01:44:08.075 --> 01:44:10.010
NEGOTIATIONS WITH BASS FOLKS IN

IN SOME OF THOSE AREAS TWO

01:49:25.292 --> 01:49:26.660
MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE LOT.

OF THOSE AREAS AND BUILD A TO

01:49:31.898 --> 01:49:33.533
TWO CLICKS ARE FOUR PLEX I THINK

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:34.167

SO WITHIN THE DUPLEXER THE FOUR

01:49:37.837 --> 01:49:38.872
PLEX THEY HAVE TO BE A TO

01:49:38.939 --> 01:49:39.806
CONFORM WITH.

01:49:39.873 --> 01:49:42.208
WHAT THE LOCAL ORDINANCE ALREADY

01:49:42.275 --> 01:49:44.144

01:49:44.210 --> 01:49:46.713
WHAT A CC IN OUR IS THE IS A A

01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:47.213
COMPANY?

01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:48.081
SO I I APOLOGIZE THAT YOU'RE

01:49:48.148 --> 01:49:48.748
REFERRING TO A LARGER

01:49:48.815 --> 01:49:50.383

01:49:50.450 --> 01:49:51.885
WITHIN THE DUPLEX THE FOUR PLEX

01:49:51.952 --> 01:49:52.852
HE WOULD NEED TO BE ABLE TO

01:49:54.854 --> 01:49:55.255
LOCAL ORDINANCES IN.

01:49:55.322 --> 01:49:56.356
THE LIGHT IT WOULD ALLOW BY

01:49:56.423 --> 01:49:57.057
RIGHT.

01:49:57.123 --> 01:50:05.665
IF YOU'RE LIVING IN A COMMUNITY

01:50:05.732 --> 01:50:08.068
FIFTY THOUSAND NOT A FOUR PLEX.

01:50:08.134 --> 01:50:09.903
I THINK THAT THAT IS PROBLEMATIC

01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:12.138
FOR THOSE HOMES THAT THE THEY

01:50:12.205 --> 01:50:13.540
BASICALLY WERE BUILT ON REGIONAL

01:50:13.606 --> 01:50:15.075
LINES ACTUALLY.

01:50:15.141 --> 01:50:16.209
HANDED OVER LOOK IN ON THE

01:50:16.276 --> 01:50:18.578
FREEWAY IN DIFFERENT AREAS BUT

01:50:18.645 --> 01:50:20.580
THEY ARE VERY EXPENSIVE -- BACON

01:50:20.647 --> 01:50:21.414
LOTS OPEN LOTS OF HAVEN'T SOLD

01:50:21.481 --> 01:50:22.649
PROBABLY MORE BECAUSE OF THE

01:50:22.716 --> 01:50:23.750
RECESSION.

01:50:23.817 --> 01:50:25.085

01:50:25.852 --> 01:50:27.387
ONLINE THAT WOULD BE VERY

01:50:27.454 --> 01:50:28.655
PROBLEMATIC AND SO YOU'RE NOT

01:50:28.722 --> 01:50:29.356
GOING TO AVOID LITIGATION ON

01:50:29.422 --> 01:50:30.390
SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT'S

01:50:30.457 --> 01:50:30.824
NOT A SECRET ISSUE.

01:50:30.890 --> 01:50:32.459
HAS TO DO WITH THE CHARACTER THE

01:50:32.525 --> 01:50:37.230
COMMUNITY IN THE CURRENT ESOS

01:50:37.297 --> 01:50:38.264
VALUES.

01:50:38.331 --> 01:50:40.266
OF THOSE COMMUNITY SO I JUST

01:50:40.333 --> 01:50:40.934
BRING THAT UP AND TAKE A LOOK AT

01:50:41.001 --> 01:50:41.234
IT.

01:50:41.301 --> 01:50:42.235
I THINK WHAT I'LL DO I I LIKE

01:50:42.302 --> 01:50:45.038
THE DIRECTION THIS IS GOING ON I

01:50:45.105 --> 01:50:46.439
KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE SOME SECRET

01:50:46.506 --> 01:50:47.374
SAUCE YOU WORKING ON TO MAKE

01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:48.708
SOME MORE CONGRUENCY WHICH IS

01:50:48.775 --> 01:50:49.476
WHICH IS GREAT.

01:50:49.542 --> 01:50:51.444

01:50:51.511 --> 01:50:52.912
THIS BUT I'D LIKE YOU TO TAKE A

01:50:52.979 --> 01:50:53.847
LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE I THINK

01:50:53.913 --> 01:50:55.181
IT'S PROBLEMATIC CERTAINLY FOR

01:50:55.248 --> 01:50:57.183
THE AREAS THAT I REPRESENT WE

01:50:57.250 --> 01:50:59.119
HAVE A LOT OF COOL CELS ON SO

01:50:59.185 --> 01:51:00.553
THAT'S ALREADY OUT THAT THESE

01:51:00.620 --> 01:51:01.855
ARE AREAS THAT ARE BEYOND THE

01:51:01.921 --> 01:51:02.055
MEAN.

01:51:02.122 --> 01:51:02.856
HIGH TIDE LINE.

01:51:02.922 --> 01:51:05.125
AND THEY ARE NOT CURRENTLY

01:51:05.191 --> 01:51:05.692
DEVELOPED BECAUSE THEY WERE

01:51:05.759 --> 01:51:07.761
PROBABLY DEVELOPED WITH THE

01:51:07.827 --> 01:51:10.063
MAJOR -- HOUSING -- PLANNED

01:51:10.130 --> 01:51:15.001
COMMUNITY PLANS PROBABLY IN THE

01:51:15.068 --> 01:51:18.471
LAST TEN YEARS.

01:51:18.538 --> 01:51:19.372

01:51:35.688 --> 01:51:37.223
TALK TO IGNORE.

01:51:37.290 --> 01:51:38.658
OF SENATE MCGUIRE YOU YOU USE

01:51:38.725 --> 01:51:40.660
THE PHRASE IT THIS WOULD APPLY

01:51:40.727 --> 01:51:41.995
290% OF CITIES.

01:51:42.062 --> 01:51:42.762
IN THE POPULATION THE CITY

01:51:42.829 --> 01:51:43.063
CALIFORNIA.

01:51:43.129 --> 01:51:44.097
I'M SORRY SAID AGAIN 90% OF THE

01:51:44.164 --> 01:51:44.397
POPULATION.

01:51:44.464 --> 01:51:47.567
OF THE STATE'S POPULATION 90% OR

01:51:47.634 --> 01:51:50.136
SO.

01:51:50.203 --> 01:51:51.638
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN BECAUSE?

01:51:51.704 --> 01:51:52.906
I DON'T HAVE ANY FERRY TERMINALS

01:51:52.972 --> 01:51:55.041
IN ORANGE COUNTY SO OF RAIL.

01:51:55.108 --> 01:51:57.577
I HAVE RAIL BUT IT'S A LOS HAND

01:51:57.644 --> 01:51:59.079
CORNER THEY CANNOT CUTS CUTS

01:51:59.145 --> 01:52:01.047
CROSS.

01:52:01.114 --> 01:52:03.416
DIAGONALLY IT'S NOT REALLY --

01:52:03.483 --> 01:52:04.384
THE ARMY OF DESERT WE TALKED AND

01:52:04.451 --> 01:52:05.318
LAST QUESTION YOU HAVE TO DRIVE

01:52:05.385 --> 01:52:07.120
TO A TO GET TO IT FOR MOST THE

01:52:07.187 --> 01:52:09.222
RESIDENTS HOPE.

SO I GUESS MAYBE 90% WHEN

01:52:10.590 --> 01:52:12.158
APPLIED ORANGE COUNTY THEN.

01:52:12.225 --> 01:52:13.693
I CAN'T TALK IF YOU SPECIFICALLY

01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:15.962

01:52:18.031 --> 01:52:21.134

01:52:36.249 --> 01:52:38.818
POPULATION AND YOU HAVE A MAP.

01:52:38.885 --> 01:52:41.321

YOUR PARDON I MEANT TO AS GO A

01:54:31.531 --> 01:54:32.165
LITTLE DEEPER ON THE PARKING

01:54:32.232 --> 01:54:33.766
ISSUE I'VE REYES SO WITH SB

01:54:33.833 --> 01:54:34.434
FIFTY THE SAME ONE HERE BUT EVEN

01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:37.003
IF PEOPLE ARE LOCATED.

01:54:37.070 --> 01:54:39.172
CLOSE TO TRANSIT RAIL BUS

01:54:39.239 --> 01:54:41.841
SERVICE ODDLY STILL MOST LIKELY

01:54:41.908 --> 01:54:43.977
ON CARS AND WHAT HAPPENS IS WHAT

01:54:44.043 --> 01:54:44.911
OF THOSE CARS GO IF WE'VE

01:54:44.978 --> 01:54:46.312
ELIMINATED.

01:54:46.379 --> 01:54:47.447
YOU KNOW PARKING REQUIREMENTS ON

01:54:47.513 --> 01:54:49.315
THE DEVELOPMENT SIDE OR EVEN

01:54:49.382 --> 01:54:50.583
JUST A HALF OF SPACE.

01:54:50.650 --> 01:54:52.485
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THOSE FIND

01:54:52.552 --> 01:54:54.053
THEIR WAY INTO THE RESIDENTIAL

01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:56.489
NEIGHBORS OF NEAR -- THE

01:54:56.556 --> 01:54:58.024
DEVELOPMENT AND WE'VE HAD

01:54:58.091 --> 01:55:00.126
PROBABLY MOST OF THE PROBLEMS

01:55:00.193 --> 01:55:01.327
THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE CITIES

01:55:01.394 --> 01:55:02.996
THAT I'M FAMILIAR WITH AND SOUTH

01:55:03.062 --> 01:55:03.596
ORANGE COUNTY.

01:55:03.663 --> 01:55:04.564
THURMOND FIGHTS OR PARKING

01:55:04.631 --> 01:55:05.865
ISSUES NOT REGARDING NEW

01:55:05.932 --> 01:55:07.800
DEVELOPMENT REGARDING --

01:55:07.867 --> 01:55:09.402
DEVELOPMENT WHERE A MULTI FAMILY

01:55:09.469 --> 01:55:10.937
THOSE CLOSE TO THOSE SINGLE

01:55:11.004 --> 01:55:12.205
FAMILY RESIDENCE CHANGE THE

01:55:12.272 --> 01:55:14.207
PARKING REQUIREMENTS SO THAT YOU

01:55:14.274 --> 01:55:15.908
HAVE TO PAY FOR PARKING.

01:55:15.975 --> 01:55:17.644
GARAGE SO THEY MOVE INTO THE

01:55:17.710 --> 01:55:18.645
RESIDENTIAL AREAS AND THAT'S

01:55:18.711 --> 01:55:20.680
WHAT THEY ALSO GETS PEOPLE ARE

01:55:20.747 --> 01:55:22.515
FOCUSED ON THE FACT THAT WITHOUT

01:55:22.582 --> 01:55:23.182
PARKING.

01:55:23.249 --> 01:55:24.917
ARE THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS DON'T

01:55:24.984 --> 01:55:26.119
WORK SO.

01:55:26.185 --> 01:55:28.321
ARE I THINK YOU NEED TO TAKE A

01:55:28.388 --> 01:55:30.356
LOOK SIGNIFICANTLY AT THE

01:55:30.423 --> 01:55:31.924
PARKING RESTRICTIONS.

01:55:31.991 --> 01:55:33.126
THAT YOU'RE ALLOWING ON THESE

01:55:33.192 --> 01:55:35.295
ARE NO PARKING REQUIREMENTS AT

01:55:35.361 --> 01:55:36.029
ALL.

01:55:36.095 --> 01:55:36.696
ARE THERE HAVE TO BE INCENTIVES

01:55:36.763 --> 01:55:38.164
GIVEN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO

01:55:38.231 --> 01:55:39.265
PROVIDE THAT EITHER SHUTTLE

01:55:39.332 --> 01:55:41.100
SERVICES YOU CAN WORK WITH THE

01:55:41.167 --> 01:55:42.935
TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES WITH

01:55:43.002 --> 01:55:44.871
THIS BE ONE AND THE MONEY THAT'S

01:55:44.937 --> 01:55:46.239
PROVIDED THEREFORE ON MORE

01:55:46.306 --> 01:55:47.106
TRANSIT.

01:55:47.173 --> 01:55:48.374
YOU CAN HAVE THOSE LOCAL

01:55:48.441 --> 01:55:50.743
CIRCULATORS THERE HAS TO BE

01:55:50.810 --> 01:55:53.379
SOMETHING -- THAT COULD PROVIDE

01:55:53.446 --> 01:55:55.348
FIRM IS SHELTERING OF SOMEONE

01:55:55.415 --> 01:55:56.983
WHO OWNS A CAR OR YOU WOULD BE

01:55:57.050 --> 01:55:58.718
REQUIRED IF YOU MOVE INTO THESE

01:55:58.785 --> 01:56:00.486
NEW DEVELOPMENTS THAT YOU

01:56:00.553 --> 01:56:01.354
BASICALLY.

01:56:01.421 --> 01:56:03.289
FIND A DOCUMENT THAT YOU DON'T

01:56:03.356 --> 01:56:04.824
OWN A CAR BECAUSE I THINK WHAT

01:56:04.891 --> 01:56:06.292
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND IS THAT.

01:56:06.359 --> 01:56:07.960
THERE WOULD BE PUBLIC SAFETY

01:56:08.027 --> 01:56:09.762
ISSUES THAT ARE CREATED WHEN YOU

01:56:09.829 --> 01:56:12.198
HAVE THESE -- RESIDENTIAL AREAS

01:56:12.265 --> 01:56:14.033
WITH TOM PARKING ALL ALONG NEXT

01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:15.868
TO THE SIDEWALKS WE HAVE HAD TWO

01:56:15.935 --> 01:56:17.370
INCIDENCES IN MY COMMUNITIES

01:56:17.437 --> 01:56:19.205
WHERE CHILDREN NOW CROSSING

01:56:19.272 --> 01:56:21.207
BETWEEN CARS AFTER THEY GET OFF

01:56:21.274 --> 01:56:22.975
THE BUS OR GOING TO SCHOOL.

01:56:23.042 --> 01:56:24.310
HAVE BEEN KILLED AND THAT'S JUST

01:56:24.377 --> 01:56:26.679
A FACT SO IT'S SIGNIFICANT WITH

01:56:26.746 --> 01:56:35.455
ME IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THIS

01:56:35.521 --> 01:56:37.523
THAT THERE'S A WAY.

01:56:37.590 --> 01:56:38.257
THERE'S GOT TO BE AN INCENTIVE

01:56:38.324 --> 01:56:39.125
IN THERE SOMEWHERE TO

01:56:39.192 --> 01:56:39.926
ACCOMMODATE ALL THE OWNERSHIP OF

01:56:39.992 --> 01:56:41.394
A CAR EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T USE

01:56:41.461 --> 01:56:42.195
IT EXCEPT.

01:56:42.261 --> 01:56:43.596
FOR LET'S SAY ON RIGHT AROUND

01:56:43.663 --> 01:56:44.497
YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD RIGHT AROUND

01:56:44.564 --> 01:56:45.765
COMMUNITY SHOPPING FOR THE

01:56:45.832 --> 01:56:46.866
WEEKEND ISSUES WHERE YOU'RE AYE

01:56:46.933 --> 01:56:47.867
TRANSPORTING CHILDREN NOT TO ALL

01:56:47.934 --> 01:56:48.935
THEIR ACTIVITIES.

01:56:49.001 --> 01:56:50.837
SO PLEASE TAKE A LONGER LOOK AT

01:56:50.903 --> 01:56:52.038
THAT AND BOTH OF BILLS BECAUSE

01:56:52.105 --> 01:56:52.805
THOSE ARE THAT'S PROBABLY THE

01:56:52.872 --> 01:56:54.140
BIGGEST HURDLE FOR ME HAVING I

01:56:54.207 --> 01:56:55.274
EXPERIENCE IT.

01:56:55.341 --> 01:56:56.509
FOR MY THIRTEEN YEARS ON A CITY

01:56:56.576 --> 01:56:58.478
COUNCIL IN MY FOUR YEARS ON THE

01:56:58.544 --> 01:56:59.345
BOARDS TO EIGHT YEARS ON THE

01:56:59.412 --> 01:57:00.813
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ALWAYS THE

01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:01.881
ISSUE.

HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR HARD

02:02:59.772 --> 02:03:00.873
WORKING CALIFORNIANS.

02:03:05.211 --> 02:03:06.579
STATEWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS

02:03:06.645 --> 02:03:09.248
WITHOUT AFFECTING SCHOOL FUNDING.

02:03:09.315 --> 02:03:10.783
SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES

02:03:10.850 --> 02:03:13.219
CALIFORNIA'S HAS FAILED TO

02:03:13.285 --> 02:03:16.055
PRODUCE THE ESTIMATED A HUNDRED

02:03:16.122 --> 02:03:16.589
EIGHTY THOUSAND NECESSARY

02:03:16.655 --> 02:03:20.292
HOUSING UNITS PER PER YEAR --

02:03:20.359 --> 02:03:23.729
THIS RESULT HAS HAS HAS CAUSED

02:03:23.796 --> 02:03:27.166
NEARLY IN MY OPINION HUNDRED

02:03:27.233 --> 02:03:27.700
THIRTY THOUSAND MEN WOMEN

02:03:27.767 --> 02:03:30.436

02:03:30.503 --> 02:03:31.370
EVERY YEAR.

02:03:31.437 --> 02:03:32.505
SO I THINK OUR HOUSING SHORES

02:03:32.571 --> 02:03:33.239
HAS ACTUALLY.

02:03:33.305 --> 02:03:35.908
CREATED THAT SITUATION.

02:03:35.975 --> 02:03:37.843
ANOTHER TWO POINT TWO MILLION

02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:40.112

02:03:40.179 --> 02:03:42.014
LOW INCOME RENTER HOUSEHOLDS ARE

02:03:42.081 --> 02:03:44.383
COMPETING FOR ONLY SIX HUNDRED

02:03:44.450 --> 02:03:47.086

AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS.

02:03:48.487 --> 02:03:50.790
THIS LEAVES ONE POINT FIVE FOUR

02:03:50.856 --> 02:03:52.458
MILLION CALIFORNIANS OF THE

02:03:52.525 --> 02:03:54.260
LOWEST INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WITHOUT

02:03:57.496 --> 02:03:59.431
BECOMING HOMELESS.

02:03:59.498 --> 02:04:00.766
THE STATE MUCH ACT WITH AN

02:04:00.833 --> 02:04:03.502
URGENCY TO ADDRESS THIS SHORTAGE.

02:04:03.569 --> 02:04:05.437
SB FIVE MAKES THE STATE A LONG

02:12:44.456 --> 02:12:45.691
OF SOME OF THE MOST RECENT

02:12:45.757 --> 02:12:46.958
AMENDMENTS THAT HVE BEEN PUT

02:12:52.364 --> 02:12:54.066
HAS WITH THE METHODOLOGY THAT'S

02:12:54.132 --> 02:12:56.168

02:12:58.570 --> 02:13:00.205
OF ANOTHER RECESSION IN A

02:13:00.272 --> 02:13:03.041
DOWNTURN IS THAT WE HAVE TO RELY

02:13:03.108 --> 02:13:05.711
ON FUTURE LEGISLATORS AGREEING

02:13:05.777 --> 02:13:08.413
TO BACK FILL UP PROPERTY TAXES

02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:10.315
FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THE

SUSPENDED TWICE.

02:13:15.253 --> 02:13:16.955
I'M SO IF WE COUNT ON THE

02:13:17.022 --> 02:13:19.391
PROMISE OF A FUTURE LEGISLATURE

02:13:19.458 --> 02:13:21.293
NOT TO SUSPEND PROP NINETY EIGHT

02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:22.961
AND TWO GUARANTEED THAT PROPERTY

02:13:23.028 --> 02:13:24.396
TAX REVENUE IS GOING TO BE BACK

02:13:24.463 --> 02:13:25.731

WE WOULD BE PUT IN A GREAT

02:13:27.099 --> 02:13:29.868
SITUATION BUT UNFORTUNATELY

02:13:29.935 --> 02:13:31.737
THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES -- FOR

02:13:31.803 --> 02:13:33.705
SCHOOLS AND SO SHOULD THERE BE

02:13:33.772 --> 02:13:35.173
AN ABSOLUTE GUARANTEE WE

02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:36.775

FROM FUTURE LEGISLATURE'S AND SO

02:13:43.382 --> 02:13:44.249

OPPOSE WE WILL CONTINUE TO TRY

02:13:46.618 --> 02:13:47.753
TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORS TO SEE

02:13:47.819 --> 02:13:49.755
IF THERE'S ANY WAY THE SITUATION

02:13:49.821 --> 02:13:50.989
CAN BE RESOLVED.

02:13:51.056 --> 02:13:52.958
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE ONLY WAY

02:13:53.024 --> 02:13:56.661
THAT WE CAN HELP OUR CONCERNS

02:13:56.728 --> 02:13:58.096
ADDRESS IS IF WE WEREN'T.

02:13:58.163 --> 02:13:59.631

02:14:13.912 --> 02:14:15.881
STATEWIDE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES

02:14:15.947 --> 02:14:17.616

02:14:17.682 --> 02:14:18.784
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN BILLION

02:14:18.850 --> 02:14:19.684

IT IS.

02:14:27.826 --> 02:14:30.395
IT'S ABOUT STEALING PROPERTY

02:14:30.462 --> 02:14:31.630
TAXES.

02:14:31.696 --> 02:14:32.664

02:14:32.731 --> 02:14:33.899
AGENCY.

02:14:33.965 --> 02:14:36.334
THAT MEANS OUR POLICE FIRE.

02:14:36.401 --> 02:14:38.570
ALL SPECIAL DISTRICTS DO NOT GET

02:16:09.628 --> 02:16:11.129
AM.

02:16:11.196 --> 02:16:14.799
IT IT IT'S RELATED TO THE THE

02:16:14.866 --> 02:16:17.636
FUNDS FOR THE PROGRAM -- SO SO

02:16:17.702 --> 02:16:20.705
WHAT WHAT THE ANALYSIS SAYS IS

02:16:20.772 --> 02:16:23.875
THAT -- THERE ARE A SERIES OF

02:16:23.942 --> 02:16:25.677
PRIORITIES AT THE COMMITTEE.

02:16:25.744 --> 02:16:28.847
IS GOING TO BE USED TO DETERMINE --

02:16:28.914 --> 02:16:30.682
WHAT PROJECTS GET FUNDED?

02:16:30.749 --> 02:16:34.719
AND AND ONE OF THE PRIORITIES IS

02:16:34.786 --> 02:16:35.854
TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND

02:16:35.921 --> 02:16:37.722
IT'S DEFINED AS A 120% OF THE

02:16:37.789 --> 02:16:40.959
MEDIAN INCOME AND SO -- ONE OF

02:16:41.026 --> 02:16:42.160
THE ISSUES I THINK THIS GOING TO

02:16:42.227 --> 02:16:44.563
BE REALLY IMPORTANT IS TO HAVE A

02:16:44.629 --> 02:16:46.631
COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS.

02:16:46.698 --> 02:16:48.133
BECAUSE IN SOME COMMUNITIES WHEN

02:16:48.199 --> 02:16:49.834
YOU WHEN YOU'RE SUBSIDIZING UP

02:16:49.901 --> 02:16:52.571
TO A 120% OF THE MEDIAN INCOME

02:16:52.637 --> 02:16:53.905
YOU'RE GOING TO BE SPENT ON THE

02:16:53.972 --> 02:16:55.106
MEDIAN INCOME IN SOME OF THE BAY

02:16:55.173 --> 02:16:57.042
AREA CITIES IS A HUNDRED

02:16:57.108 --> 02:16:57.776
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

02:16:57.842 --> 02:16:58.877
YOU'RE GOING TO BE SUBSIDIZING

02:16:58.944 --> 02:17:00.211
SOMEONE WHO'S EARNING A HUNDRED

02:17:00.278 --> 02:17:01.846
AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

02:17:01.913 --> 02:17:05.116

LIKE TO SEE SOME KIND OF EQUITY

02:17:20.298 --> 02:17:22.934
RATHER THAN SUBSIDIZING SOMEONE

02:17:23.001 --> 02:17:24.235
WHO EARNS A HUNDRED AND 20% OF

02:17:24.302 --> 02:17:26.171
THE MEDIAN INCOME WHEN IT'S A

02:17:26.237 --> 02:17:27.339

THE FORMULA.

02:17:40.085 --> 02:17:41.486
SHOULD LOOK LIKE BUT I'M I WANT

02:17:41.553 --> 02:17:42.787
TO PUT THAT PLUGIN THAT THERE BE

02:17:42.854 --> 02:17:44.456
A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS THAT THE

02:17:44.522 --> 02:17:45.924
COMMITTEE WILL LOOK AT BECAUSE

02:17:45.991 --> 02:17:49.294
OTHERWISE AS THEY TRY -- TO TO

02:17:49.361 --> 02:17:52.664
HAVE GEOGRAPHICAL -- COVERAGE IN

02:17:52.731 --> 02:17:54.432
THE STATE YOU'RE GONNA RUN INTO

02:17:54.499 --> 02:17:56.534
THESE ANOMALIES BUT OTHER THAN

02:17:56.601 --> 02:17:57.402
THAT I THINK IT'S GREAT AND I

02:17:57.469 --> 02:18:03.108
SUPPORT THE BILL YEAH THE THE

02:18:03.174 --> 02:18:04.809

SO EACH COMMUNITY HOUSES SUBMIT

02:18:06.444 --> 02:18:08.279

02:18:08.346 --> 02:18:11.049
HAVE ABOUT THE LOOKING AT THOSE

02:18:11.116 --> 02:18:12.784
KINDS OF FACTORS SO.

02:18:12.851 --> 02:18:14.386
COULD BE PART OF THE PLAN

02:18:14.452 --> 02:18:16.221
REQUIREMENTS WE WILL WELL WORK

02:18:16.287 --> 02:18:18.089
WITH YOUR OFFICE IN [inaudible]

02:18:18.156 --> 02:18:19.891
OTHERS.

TOO SEE WE CAN -- ACCOMMODATE.

02:18:22.994 --> 02:18:23.795
GREAT THANK YOU I THINK YOU'RE

02:18:23.862 --> 02:18:27.065
IN THE RIGHT PLACE WHERE WE ARE.

02:18:27.132 --> 02:18:27.899
SIMILAR FEELINGS ABOUT THE

02:18:27.966 --> 02:18:31.036
SUBJECT [inaudible]

02:18:31.102 --> 02:18:32.637
SENATOR RUSSELL.

YES -- COULD YOU -- PLEASE

02:18:35.073 --> 02:18:37.409

02:18:37.475 --> 02:18:39.811
FUNDS BEING DIVERTED FROM PUBLIC

02:18:39.878 --> 02:18:41.079
EDUCATION OBVIOUSLY.

02:18:41.146 --> 02:18:42.914
NO WILL VERY PROTECTIVE OF OUR

02:18:42.981 --> 02:18:45.350
PUBLIC EDUCATION SO IF YOU COULD

02:18:45.417 --> 02:18:46.918
RESPOND TO THAT.

02:18:46.985 --> 02:18:48.486
I THINK THE THE FEAR OBVIOUSLY

02:18:48.553 --> 02:18:49.421
IS.

02:18:49.487 --> 02:18:51.756
GOING BACK TO REDEVELOPMENT OKAY.

02:18:51.823 --> 02:18:53.358
AND REDEVELOPMENT IS YOU KNOW

02:18:53.425 --> 02:18:56.027
WAS -- TAX INCREMENT FINANCING.

02:18:56.094 --> 02:18:58.630
THAT SIMPLY -- ALLOW THE CITY TO

02:18:58.697 --> 02:19:00.331
CREATE A REDEVELOPMENT SAYING

02:19:00.398 --> 02:19:03.868
AUTOMATICALLY -- TOOK

02:19:03.935 --> 02:19:06.971
REDEVELOPMENT FUNDS -- ENDED UP

02:19:07.038 --> 02:19:09.441
BY THE TIME THAT -- WE DISSOLVE

02:19:09.507 --> 02:19:11.643
REDEVELOPMENT IT WAS OVER FIVE

02:19:11.710 --> 02:19:14.112
BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OF

02:19:14.179 --> 02:19:16.181
PROPERTY TAXES WERE USED

02:19:16.247 --> 02:19:18.183
STATEWIDE AND REDEVELOPMENT.

02:19:18.249 --> 02:19:22.587
THERE'S A LOT OF UNCONTROLLED.

02:19:22.654 --> 02:19:24.522
OF REDEVELOPMENT IN THE STATE OF

02:19:24.589 --> 02:19:26.157
CALIFORNIA SOME COUNTIES HAD AS

02:19:26.224 --> 02:19:29.694
MUCH AS A FOR A 30% OF THE TOTAL

02:19:29.761 --> 02:19:31.062
PROPERTY TAX.

02:19:31.129 --> 02:19:32.864
WENT TO REDEVELOPMENT WHAT THIS

02:19:32.931 --> 02:19:35.333
PLAN DOES INSTEAD IS TO NOT

02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:37.402
ALLOW THAT KIND OF SITUATION TO

02:19:37.469 --> 02:19:39.871
OCCUR AGAIN WITH THIS ALLOWS IS

02:19:39.938 --> 02:19:42.774
A COMMITTEE. TO BE CREATED AND

02:19:42.841 --> 02:19:44.809
EACH CITY WOULD SUBMIT AN

02:19:44.876 --> 02:19:46.811
APPLICATION AND THE COMMITTEE

02:19:46.878 --> 02:19:48.513
WOULD LOOK AT THAT APPLICATION

02:19:48.580 --> 02:19:49.581
TO SIDE.

02:19:49.647 --> 02:19:52.050
OF THE LEVEL OF TAX INCREMENT

02:19:52.117 --> 02:19:54.853
FINANCING TO BE ALLOWED IN THAT

02:19:54.919 --> 02:19:56.321
APPLICATION FOR THAT CITY.

02:19:56.387 --> 02:19:58.556
OR COUNTY OR OR OTHER ENTITY

02:19:58.623 --> 02:20:00.458
THAT THAT CREATES THESE WE ALSO

02:20:00.525 --> 02:20:03.561
HAVE A PROVISION IN THIS LAW.

02:20:03.628 --> 02:20:04.896
AND WE HAVE A LETTER FROM THE

02:20:04.963 --> 02:20:06.297
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE

02:20:06.364 --> 02:20:09.100
WHICH EXAMINED SB FIVE AND THE

02:20:09.167 --> 02:20:11.402
LETTER BASICALLY SAYS.

02:20:11.469 --> 02:20:14.906
THAT SB FIVE WOULD HAVE -- IF IF

02:20:14.973 --> 02:20:16.674
IMPLEMENTED THE WAY WE HAVE IN

02:20:16.741 --> 02:20:19.077
THE STATUTE IT WOULD HAD A

02:20:19.144 --> 02:20:20.712
SUMMARY THIS IS UNDER SB FIVE

02:20:20.779 --> 02:20:22.080
THE STATE WOULD.

02:20:22.147 --> 02:20:24.415
BE REQUIRED TO RE BENCH THE RAF

02:20:24.482 --> 02:20:26.684
REDUCTIONS PART TO RISE BY THE

02:20:26.751 --> 02:20:27.685
AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMUNITY

02:20:27.752 --> 02:20:29.420
DEVELOPMENT IT WAS IT INVESTMENT

02:20:29.487 --> 02:20:30.655
PROGRAM.

02:20:30.722 --> 02:20:32.957
THIS REQUIREMENT MEANS THE STATE

02:20:33.024 --> 02:20:34.559
EFFECTIVELY WOULD BE COVERING

02:20:34.626 --> 02:20:36.027
THE COSTS OF THE PROGRAM.

02:20:36.094 --> 02:20:37.262
THROUGH THE ADDITIONAL JENNER

02:20:37.328 --> 02:20:38.663
FRONT GENERAL FUND SPENDING

02:20:38.730 --> 02:20:40.365
RATHER THAN A REDUCTION IN

02:20:40.431 --> 02:20:43.001
SCHOOL FUNDING SO IT'S IT'S IT'S

02:20:43.067 --> 02:20:44.335
A MATTER IF THE SCHOOLS WOULD BE

02:20:44.402 --> 02:20:48.306
MADE WHOLE UNDER THIS

02:20:48.373 --> 02:20:49.374
LEGISLATION.

02:20:49.440 --> 02:20:50.675
SO SO THAT'S THE LETTER FROM THE

02:20:50.742 --> 02:20:51.309
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AND THEN WE

02:20:51.376 --> 02:20:52.477
ALSO PUT -- PROVISIONS

02:20:52.544 --> 02:20:54.512
ADDITIONAL SET UP PROVISIONS IN

02:20:54.579 --> 02:20:57.282
THE LOBBY ON EVEN EVEN WHEN THE

02:20:57.348 --> 02:20:59.317
LETTER WAS WRITTEN DATED MARCH

02:20:59.384 --> 02:21:00.718
EIGHTEENTH WE ADDED SOME

02:21:00.785 --> 02:21:03.188
ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS IN THE

02:21:03.254 --> 02:21:04.122
AMENDMENTS THAT RECENTLY WE'RE

02:21:04.189 --> 02:21:05.056
DONE.

02:21:05.123 --> 02:21:06.457
I'M SORRY SIR SO THE FUNDING

02:21:06.524 --> 02:21:08.426
WOULD CONTINUE TO COME THROUGH

02:21:08.493 --> 02:21:10.161
THE GENERAL FUND.

02:21:10.228 --> 02:21:12.230
EVERY YEAR ON ONGOING BASIS SO

02:21:12.297 --> 02:21:13.765
IT WOULDN'T TAKE AWAY FROM

02:21:13.832 --> 02:21:16.534
FUNDING TOWARDS THE PUBLIC

02:21:16.601 --> 02:21:17.535
EDUCATION.

02:21:17.602 --> 02:21:20.038
WE WOULD HAVE -- TO DECIDE HOW

02:21:20.104 --> 02:21:22.807
MUCH MOEY WE WANTED TO PUT.

02:21:22.874 --> 02:21:24.843
IN THIS PROGRAM WITH THE JOB THE

02:21:24.909 --> 02:21:28.146
THE BILL ALLOWS FOR A RAMPING UP.

02:21:28.213 --> 02:21:30.181
FROM TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

02:21:30.248 --> 02:21:32.083
A YEAR UP TO TWO BILLION DOLLARS

02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:34.552
OVER TEN YEARS. TEN YEAR PERIOD

02:21:34.619 --> 02:21:35.653
SO IT'S A RAMP UP.

02:21:35.720 --> 02:21:37.589
IT DOESN'T GO UP ALL OF A SUDDEN

02:21:37.655 --> 02:21:40.291
RAMPS UP TO TWO BILLION DOLLARS.

02:21:40.358 --> 02:21:45.864
IT -- IT ALSO -- OF COURSE --

02:21:45.930 --> 02:21:48.199
DEALS WITH -- SCHOOLS IN ANOTHER

02:21:48.266 --> 02:21:51.769
WAY THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS UC.

02:21:51.836 --> 02:21:53.371
OF AND I THINK YOU HAVE A COPY

02:21:53.438 --> 02:21:54.405
SHOWS THAT.

02:21:54.472 --> 02:21:56.574
THIS BILL WILL GENERATE --

02:21:56.641 --> 02:21:59.577
SIGNIFICANT LOCAL STATE REVENUES

02:21:59.644 --> 02:22:02.113
IN AND TAXES AND THEN.

02:22:02.180 --> 02:22:04.215
I THINK THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS

02:22:04.282 --> 02:22:04.949
DONE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

02:22:05.016 --> 02:22:08.052
NUMBER WAS IN IN YOUR REPORT.

02:22:08.119 --> 02:22:09.354
FOR TAX INCOME.

02:22:09.420 --> 02:22:11.289
FROM THE LEGISLATION IT WAS A

02:22:11.356 --> 02:22:12.690
TOTAL OF TWO POINT FIVE BILLION

02:22:12.757 --> 02:22:15.059
DOLLARS. TWO POINT FIVE BILLION

02:22:15.126 --> 02:22:15.994
DOLLARS.

02:22:16.060 --> 02:22:19.397
AND WE ALSO HAVE IN THE BILL.

02:22:19.464 --> 02:22:22.267
A WHAT WE CALL AN OFFRAMP OF

02:22:22.333 --> 02:22:24.035
WHAT I CALL A BUTTON THAT CAN BE

02:22:24.102 --> 02:22:26.004
PUSHED BY THE LEGISLATURE. TO

02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:27.171
STOP.

02:22:27.238 --> 02:22:29.674
THE PROGRAM IF THERE'S A FISCAL

02:22:29.741 --> 02:22:31.342
DOWNTURN.

02:22:31.409 --> 02:22:33.912
SO WE HAVE A A PROCESS FOR THAT

02:22:33.978 --> 02:22:36.014
AS WELL THAT IN A BUDGETARY

02:22:36.080 --> 02:22:41.319
PROCESS WE CAN DECIDE -- TO STOP

02:22:41.386 --> 02:22:44.422
THE THE THE SPENDING ON THIS

02:22:44.489 --> 02:22:46.357
PROPOSED THIS PROGRAM -- DURING

02:22:46.424 --> 02:22:50.395
A FISCAL -- PROBLEM PERIOD IN

02:22:50.461 --> 02:22:51.863
THE STATE SO YOU CAN YOU CAN.

02:22:51.930 --> 02:22:53.564
ACTUALLY HAVE THAT IMPLEMENTED

02:22:53.631 --> 02:22:56.734
IT ACTUALLY SAYS IS IMPLEMENTED --

02:22:56.801 --> 02:23:00.004
BY THE LEGISLATURE -- WHEN --

02:23:00.071 --> 02:23:03.441
WHEN -- FISCAL EMERGENCY SICK

02:23:03.508 --> 02:23:04.776
PLACE SO FOR YOU TO SEE ANY.

02:23:04.842 --> 02:23:08.579
DANGER OR THREAT TO THE FUNDING

02:23:08.646 --> 02:23:10.682
TO PUBLIC EDUCATION AS I DON'T

02:23:10.748 --> 02:23:11.916
BUT I THINK I THINK THE RAISE

02:23:11.983 --> 02:23:13.518
LEGITIMATE ISSUES ABOUT THE

02:23:13.584 --> 02:23:15.253
OVERALL LACK OF FUNDING FOR

02:23:15.320 --> 02:23:17.355
PUBLIC EDUCATION I I CERTAINLY

02:23:17.422 --> 02:23:20.124
AM SYMPATHETIC.

02:23:20.191 --> 02:23:22.760
AND THAT'S AN ISSUE I MEAN

02:23:22.827 --> 02:23:23.428
THAT'S LIKE I THINK THE FEAR IS

02:23:23.494 --> 02:23:26.331
BASED ON JUST THE LACK OF

02:23:26.397 --> 02:23:27.832
OVERALL.

02:23:27.899 --> 02:23:31.369
FUNDING AND I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC --

02:23:31.436 --> 02:23:34.172
HOWEVER IT'S UP TO US.

02:23:34.238 --> 02:23:36.040
TO DEAL WITH THAT QUESTION.

02:23:36.107 --> 02:23:38.509
THIS WOULD ALLOW A PROGRAM FOR

02:23:38.576 --> 02:23:40.011
THE FIRST TIME IN CALIFORNIA.

02:23:40.078 --> 02:23:43.147
TELL AN ONGOING MAJOR SOURCE OF

02:23:43.214 --> 02:23:46.718
OF FUNDING WITH CITY GOVERNMENTS.

02:23:46.784 --> 02:23:48.653
TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND

02:23:48.720 --> 02:23:50.855
AN ATTACK OF ANY ECONOMIC

02:23:50.922 --> 02:23:54.258
DEVELOPER AND TO ATTACK POVERTY

02:23:54.325 --> 02:23:54.859
THAT'S WITH THIS PROGRAM WOULD

02:23:54.926 --> 02:23:55.626
DO.

02:23:55.693 --> 02:23:56.461
AND IF THERE'S ANY WAY THAT WE

02:23:56.527 --> 02:23:58.696
COULD MAKE THAT CLEAR THAT

02:23:58.763 --> 02:24:00.531
THERE'S NO THREAT TO THE PUBLIC

02:24:00.598 --> 02:24:03.401
FUNDING THAT.

02:24:03.468 --> 02:24:05.703
IN IF IT'S OKAY WITH MISTER BELL

02:24:05.770 --> 02:24:07.038
DAY TRIP TO TO SENATOR ALSO.

02:24:07.105 --> 02:24:08.072
WE'VE WE'VE TAKEN THE CONCERNS

02:24:08.139 --> 02:24:09.374
VERY SERIOUSLY THE EDUCATION

02:24:09.440 --> 02:24:10.675
COALITION.

02:24:10.742 --> 02:24:12.443
ON IN WE HAVE GREATLY

02:24:12.510 --> 02:24:13.578
APPRECIATED OUR TIME SITTING

02:24:13.644 --> 02:24:15.480
DOWN WITH HIM SEVERAL TIMES.

02:24:15.546 --> 02:24:15.980
THAT'S WHY WE WENT TO

02:24:16.047 --> 02:24:17.015
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE TO

02:24:17.081 --> 02:24:18.583
BE ABLE TO GET A REVIEW OF THE

02:24:18.649 --> 02:24:19.350
ENTIRE BILL.

02:24:19.417 --> 02:24:20.418
AND WE'LL BE HAPPY TO BE TO

02:24:20.485 --> 02:24:22.020
PROVIDE YOU WITH THE LEGISLATIVE

02:24:22.086 --> 02:24:23.755
ANALYST'S OFFICE IN A REVIEW OF

02:24:23.821 --> 02:24:25.056
THE BILL AND WHY THEY BELIEVE

02:24:25.123 --> 02:24:26.457
THERE WILL NOT BE A FISCAL

02:24:26.524 --> 02:24:27.291
IMPACT.

GREETED WITH A HARSH REALITY.

02:41:06.456 --> 02:41:07.691
AND FEAR.

I QUICKLY LEARNED UPON MY

RELEASE THAT THE AVERAGE RATE

02:41:10.260 --> 02:41:11.862

HOUSING WAS A VITAL COMPONENT IN

02:41:16.666 --> 02:41:18.168
THE SUCCESS OF MY FUTURE.

OF CONVERSATION WAS HOUSING.

02:41:36.953 --> 02:41:39.122
I QUICKLY LEARNED THAT I WAS FAR

02:41:39.189 --> 02:41:41.458
FROM LOAN ALONE IN MY ANXIETY

02:41:41.525 --> 02:41:43.827

TIME TO FIND A HOUSING?

02:42:06.116 --> 02:42:07.484
AND SO SHE HAD TO LIVE IN A CAR

02:42:07.551 --> 02:42:08.685
FOR A WHILE.

02:42:08.752 --> 02:42:10.220

CARE ABOUT AND I'VE.

03:15:45.900 --> 03:15:47.535

ENDING UP IN THE CRIMINAL

03:15:52.941 --> 03:15:55.510
JUSTICE SYSTEM -- I'VE ALWAYS

03:15:55.577 --> 03:15:57.312
THOUGHT WE COULD DO MORE AND AND

03:15:57.378 --> 03:15:59.981
TRY TO ENCOURAGE LASTING FAMILY

03:16:00.048 --> 03:16:01.449
RELATIONSHIPS AND SO.

03:16:01.516 --> 03:16:03.418
I WAS INTRIGUED BY THIS IDEA OF

03:16:03.485 --> 03:16:07.856
MAYBE WE CAN INCENTIVIZE --

03:16:07.922 --> 03:16:10.692
FAMILIES TO TAKE IN FOSTER YOUTH.

03:16:10.758 --> 03:16:13.228
BY CREATING A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM --

03:16:13.294 --> 03:16:15.296
ANTI IT.

03:16:15.363 --> 03:16:16.664
SERENA AND SO.

BACK AND SAID YOU KNOW CAN WE

03:16:19.234 --> 03:16:21.035
LOWER FROM 10% 25% I SAID

03:16:21.102 --> 03:16:22.737
ABSOLUTELY I MEAN I I I JUST

03:16:22.804 --> 03:16:23.705
WANT TO SEE.

03:16:23.771 --> 03:16:26.107
IF IF AN INCENTIVE WORKS.

03:16:26.174 --> 03:16:28.476
BECAUSE I HAVE THIS CRAZY IDEA

03:16:28.543 --> 03:16:30.111
THAT IF WE CAN CREATE.

03:16:30.178 --> 03:16:31.613
THIS PROGRAM.

03:16:31.679 --> 03:16:34.115
AND CREATE RELATIONSHIPS WITH

03:16:34.182 --> 03:16:35.750
FAMILIES BEYOND EMANCIPATION

03:16:35.817 --> 03:16:38.286
THAT WE MIGHT BE HELPING A CHILD.

03:16:38.353 --> 03:16:39.220
YOU KNOW ONCE THEY'RE OUT OF THE

03:16:39.287 --> 03:16:40.755
SYSTEM AND SO THAT'S SORT OF THE

03:16:40.822 --> 03:16:42.891
THEORY BEHIND IT AND SO I REALLY

03:16:42.957 --> 03:16:44.125
APPRECIATE THE CHAIR AND THE

03:16:44.192 --> 03:16:45.960
STAFF WORKING WITH US TO GET

03:16:46.027 --> 03:16:46.361
THIS.

03:16:46.427 --> 03:16:48.096
IN A POSITION WHERE I BELIEVE

03:16:48.163 --> 03:16:49.597
THE CHAIR -- WILL HAVE YOUR

03:16:49.664 --> 03:16:51.266
SUPPORT TODAY BUT THAT'S THE

03:16:51.332 --> 03:16:54.269
WHOLE THEORY BEHIND IT IT'S NOT.

03:16:54.335 --> 03:16:55.370
TO TO TO GIVE ANYBODY RELIEF

03:16:55.436 --> 03:16:57.138
IT'S NOT TO GIVE ANY SPECIAL

03:16:57.205 --> 03:16:58.840
TREATMENT JUST TO TRY TO CREATE

03:16:58.907 --> 03:17:01.376
SOME SYSTEM. TO HELP INCENTIVIZE

03:17:01.442 --> 03:17:03.778
PLACING FOSTER YOUTH IN.

03:17:03.845 --> 03:17:05.480
SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND SO

03:17:05.547 --> 03:17:07.248
THAT'S THE HEART OF IT -- AT THE

03:17:07.315 --> 03:17:09.083
SAME TIME WE WERE APPROACHED BY

03:17:09.150 --> 03:17:11.519
THE SENIOR LEGISLATURE -- TO

03:17:11.586 --> 03:17:13.588
TALK ABOUT -- HOW SHARING

03:17:13.655 --> 03:17:15.323
ARRANGEMENTS FOR LOW INCOME

03:17:15.390 --> 03:17:17.025
SENIORS WHO FIND THEMSELVES

03:17:17.091 --> 03:17:18.860
HOMELESS OR ABOUT TO BE HOMELESS

03:17:18.927 --> 03:17:20.962
ARE HARM HURTING WHEN THEY'RE

03:17:21.029 --> 03:17:23.565
RENTING OR BUYING -- AND SO YOU

03:17:23.631 --> 03:17:24.599
KNOW WE WANT ALSO HELP THAT

03:17:24.666 --> 03:17:28.203
POPULATION BY -- GIVING SOME --

03:17:28.269 --> 03:17:29.904
COMMONSENSE TO HOME SHARING WITH

03:17:29.971 --> 03:17:31.739
SENIOR SO THIS BILL DEALS WITH

03:17:31.806 --> 03:17:33.641
BOTH OF THOSE ISSUES -- I THINK

03:17:33.708 --> 03:17:35.543
THEY'RE BOTH YOU KNOW WHERE THE

03:17:35.610 --> 03:17:38.613
EFFORTS AND SO WITH THAT I WOULD

03:17:38.680 --> 03:17:41.382
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

03:17:41.449 --> 03:17:43.718

03:17:59.901 --> 03:18:02.003

YES IS THE CENTER HAS SAID WE

03:18:04.772 --> 03:18:05.273
HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE BRIAN

03:18:05.340 --> 03:18:05.807
AUGUSTA.

03:18:05.873 --> 03:18:07.976
WHICH CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL

03:18:08.042 --> 03:18:09.510
ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION.

03:18:09.577 --> 03:18:11.412
IN AS A SENATOR PORTANTINO NOTED

03:18:11.479 --> 03:18:13.615
WE HAVE HAD A SIMILAR POSITION

03:18:13.681 --> 03:18:16.851
ON HIS PRIOR BILL AND WE'VE SEEN

03:18:16.918 --> 03:18:18.086
OTHER BILLS FROM OTHER AUTHORS.

03:18:18.152 --> 03:18:19.887
AND IT JUST NOTE FOR THE

03:18:19.954 --> 03:18:22.490
COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION -- NOW

03:18:22.557 --> 03:18:24.392
OBVIOUSLY WE REGRET OPPOSING

03:18:24.459 --> 03:18:25.093
THIS BILL BECAUSE ARE VERY

03:18:25.159 --> 03:18:25.860
SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOAL OF

03:18:25.927 --> 03:18:27.395
INCREASING FOSTER YOUTH

03:18:27.462 --> 03:18:29.063
PLACEMENTS AND SHARED HOUSING

03:18:29.130 --> 03:18:30.231
ARRANGEMENTS.

03:18:30.298 --> 03:18:31.165
WE DON'T AGREE WITH THIS

03:18:31.232 --> 03:18:32.533
APPROACH AND IT'S YOU KNOW

03:18:32.600 --> 03:18:34.936
COMING ON THE HEELS OF A A LONG.

03:18:35.003 --> 03:18:36.137
DISCUSSION THIS AFTERNOON ABOUT

03:18:36.204 --> 03:18:40.108
HOW DO WE INCREASE THE HOUSING

03:18:40.174 --> 03:18:41.843
SUPPLY.

03:18:41.909 --> 03:18:42.977
THIS BILL WOULD.

03:18:43.044 --> 03:18:43.845
DECREASE.

03:18:43.911 --> 03:18:44.579
OUR POTENTIAL SITES FOR THE

03:18:44.646 --> 03:18:46.314
PRODUCTION OF HOUSING AFFORDABLE

03:18:46.381 --> 03:18:47.715
TO LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS.

03:18:47.782 --> 03:18:49.651
BECAUSE IT WOULD IT WOULD TAKE

03:18:49.717 --> 03:18:50.151
OUR REGION HOUSING NEEDS

03:18:50.218 --> 03:18:52.353
ALLOCATION AND ALLOW THE CITY TO

03:18:52.420 --> 03:18:56.124
REDUCE IT EVEN BY THE 5% THAT --

03:18:56.190 --> 03:18:57.492
THE COMMITTEE IS REQUESTED.

03:18:57.558 --> 03:18:58.760
REDUCE IT BY 5% WHICH WOULD

03:18:58.826 --> 03:19:00.428
CORRESPOND TO REDUCING THE

03:19:00.495 --> 03:19:01.663
AMOUNT OF LAND THAT A CITY MUST

03:19:01.729 --> 03:19:03.431
IDENTIFY ITS HOUSING ELEMENT TO

03:19:03.498 --> 03:19:04.666
MEET THAT NEED.

03:19:04.732 --> 03:19:05.266
AND WE THINK THAT'S THE WRONG

03:19:05.333 --> 03:19:07.669
APPROACH. TO ADDRESSING THE NEED

03:19:07.735 --> 03:19:09.103
THAT MISTER PORTANTINO HAS

03:19:09.170 --> 03:19:10.738
IDENTIFIED -- WOULD LOVE TO

03:19:10.805 --> 03:19:12.040
FIGURE OUT SOME OTHER INCENTIVES

03:19:12.106 --> 03:19:13.308
BUT ALLOWING A CITY TO REDUCE

03:19:13.374 --> 03:19:15.043
ITS PLANNING FOR HOUSING TO DO

03:19:15.109 --> 03:19:16.010
THAT.

03:19:16.077 --> 03:19:16.878
WHO DON'T SEE THE CONNECTION

03:19:16.944 --> 03:19:18.212
THAT WILL HELP ENSURE THAT OUR

03:19:18.279 --> 03:19:21.749
HOUSEHOLD AGREES TO TAKE EITHER?

03:19:21.816 --> 03:19:23.084
A MEMBER OF EITHER POPULATION

03:19:23.151 --> 03:19:25.086
BUT WE WILL SEE A LOSS OF

03:19:25.153 --> 03:19:26.087
PRODUCTION OF NEW HOUSING WHICH

03:19:26.154 --> 03:19:29.691
WE DESPERATELY NEED AND AND FOR

03:19:29.757 --> 03:19:32.327
THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSED.

03:19:32.393 --> 03:19:33.728
ANNUAL OR WITH THE WESTERN

03:19:33.795 --> 03:19:35.930
CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY --

03:19:35.997 --> 03:19:37.598
JUST ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY

03:19:37.665 --> 03:19:39.233
COLLEAGUE FROM ZERO F. WE NEED

03:19:39.300 --> 03:19:41.369
MORE SITES FOR HOUSING NOT FEWER

03:19:41.436 --> 03:19:43.071
AND UNFORTUNATELY THE UPSHOT OF

03:19:43.137 --> 03:19:44.605
THIS BILL IS THAT CITIES A TAKE

03:19:44.672 --> 03:19:46.507
ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROGRAM WILL.

SENATOR TO FIND WAYS. TO GET

03:19:53.881 --> 03:19:56.284
MORE FOSTER PLACEMENTS BUT THIS

03:19:56.351 --> 03:19:57.985
IS THE WRONG APPROACH. THIRTY

03:19:58.052 --> 03:20:01.823

TO RESPOND WITH A FIFTY FOUR I

03:20:18.539 --> 03:20:19.841
THINK THE KEY THING.

03:20:19.907 --> 03:20:22.009
WORD WAS POTENTIAL SO UNDER THE

03:20:22.076 --> 03:20:23.277
CURRENT HOUSING LAW.

03:20:23.344 --> 03:20:25.179
WHEN YOU PLAN FOR HOUSING IT'S?

03:20:25.246 --> 03:20:26.314
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY BUILD

03:20:26.381 --> 03:20:30.184
IT AND SO WE'RE NOT REDUCING.

03:20:30.251 --> 03:20:31.386
ANYTHING WERE PLACING

03:20:31.452 --> 03:20:31.686
[inaudible]

03:20:31.753 --> 03:20:33.221
POR.

03:20:33.287 --> 03:20:35.123
FOSTER CHILDREN IN HOMES IN

03:20:35.189 --> 03:20:36.924
ORDER TO GET.

03:20:36.991 --> 03:20:40.261
THE 5% IN ORDER TO QUALIFY IT'S

03:20:40.328 --> 03:20:41.763
NOT A THEORETICAL PLACEMENT.

03:20:41.829 --> 03:20:44.232
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO PLACE.

03:20:44.298 --> 03:20:47.268
THIS NEEDY CHILD IN A HOME.

03:20:47.335 --> 03:20:49.337
YOU DON'T GET A 5% REDUCTION IN

03:20:49.404 --> 03:20:50.438
YOUR HOUSING ELEMENT JUST

03:20:50.505 --> 03:20:52.373
BECAUSE YOU SAY YOU WANT.

03:20:52.440 --> 03:20:55.109
TO IF YOU ACTUALLY PLACE A CHILD

03:20:55.176 --> 03:20:57.745
IN A HOME.

03:20:57.812 --> 03:20:59.514
IT UP 25%.

03:20:59.580 --> 03:21:00.448
YOU CAN MEET YOUR HOUSING

03:21:00.515 --> 03:21:01.849
REQUIREMENTS OR NOT GETTING OUT

03:21:01.916 --> 03:21:03.184
OF ANYTHING.

03:21:03.251 --> 03:21:04.218
AND WE'RE TAKING SOMETHING

03:21:04.285 --> 03:21:05.987
THAT'S IN THEORY.

03:21:06.053 --> 03:21:07.622
AND WE'RE ACTUALLY SAYING IT HAS

03:21:07.688 --> 03:21:09.524
TO BE HAPPEN AND I THINK THAT'S

03:21:09.590 --> 03:21:11.959
AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION -- AND

03:21:12.026 --> 03:21:13.861
I THINK THIS IS A POPULATION

03:21:13.928 --> 03:21:15.797
THAT'S POOR.

03:21:15.863 --> 03:21:17.665
A POPULATION THAT SOMETIMES

03:21:17.732 --> 03:21:19.167
DOESN'T HAVE A FAMILY UNIT.

03:21:19.233 --> 03:21:21.002
IT'S A POPULATION THAT'S

03:21:21.068 --> 03:21:22.537
OFTENTIMES FORGOTTEN.

03:21:22.603 --> 03:21:23.805
AND IF WE CAN CREATE AN

03:21:23.871 --> 03:21:25.173
INCENTIVE FOR THAT ACTUALLY

03:21:25.239 --> 03:21:29.210
PLACES KIDS IN A HOME. FOR A

03:21:29.277 --> 03:21:32.814
MERE 5% IN CENTER OF I THINK

03:21:32.880 --> 03:21:34.515
THAT'S A LAUDABLE GOAL IN A

03:21:34.582 --> 03:21:36.884
LAUDABLE PURPOSE AND YOU KNOW

03:21:36.951 --> 03:21:38.653
WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH WHAT.

03:21:38.719 --> 03:21:41.556
YOU KNOW HOW TO PLACE FOSTER USE

03:21:41.622 --> 03:21:42.957
FOR FIFTY YEARS.

03:21:43.024 --> 03:21:45.493
AND YEAH IT'S AN OUT OF THE BOX

03:21:45.560 --> 03:21:47.462
THING IT DOESN'T BUILD ANYTHING

03:21:47.528 --> 03:21:48.129
BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY

03:21:48.196 --> 03:21:50.364
ANYTHIG BUT TO PROVIDE SHELTER

03:21:50.431 --> 03:21:51.732
FOR A FOSTER YOUTH [inaudible]

03:21:51.799 --> 03:21:54.101
ANYWAY.

03:21:54.168 --> 03:21:58.206
I CENTER MY COUNTY.

03:21:58.272 --> 03:22:00.741
OF RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH

03:22:00.808 --> 03:22:03.377
WITH YOUR COMMENT -- I KNOW THAT

03:22:03.444 --> 03:22:05.313
WE'VE HAD A PROBLEM WITH UNDER

03:22:05.379 --> 03:22:07.915
RENO HAVING CITIES PRODUCE

03:22:07.982 --> 03:22:10.852
HOUSING AND AND WE ALL AGREE

03:22:10.918 --> 03:22:12.453
MAYBE WELL DONE AGREE BUT WE WE

03:22:12.520 --> 03:22:13.721
REALIZE IT JUST IDENTIFYING

03:22:13.788 --> 03:22:14.722
SITES.

03:22:14.789 --> 03:22:16.357
THAT WE'VE DONE FOR HOUSING

03:22:16.424 --> 03:22:17.758
ELEMENT AFTER HOUSE MANAGE TO

03:22:17.825 --> 03:22:19.093
HOUSING ELEMENT ISN'T ISN'T

03:22:19.160 --> 03:22:21.562
ENOUGH IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHAT

03:22:21.629 --> 03:22:22.864
YOU WANT IS.

03:22:22.930 --> 03:22:24.699
YOUR THIS THIS MECHANISM WILL

03:22:24.765 --> 03:22:26.667
NOT PRODUCE ANY NEW HOUSING

03:22:26.734 --> 03:22:28.503
YOU'LL JUST SAY IT WILL JUST SAY

03:22:28.569 --> 03:22:30.638

THERE IN A STABLE ENVIRONMENT.

03:22:34.041 --> 03:22:36.511
THEN YOU CAN COUNT THAT TOWARDS

03:22:36.577 --> 03:22:41.148
TOWARDS THE THE THE NUMBER I

03:22:41.215 --> 03:22:43.384
PERCENT.

03:22:43.451 --> 03:22:43.951
WHEN THE WAY IT EIGHT EIGHT

CONTINUOUSLY I DIDN'T SUPPORTER

03:22:55.463 --> 03:22:57.365

THAT YOU CAN GO IN AND GET THAT

03:22:59.133 --> 03:23:00.535

ENVIRONMENT PROVIDING A HOME.

WE'RE NOT BUILDING A HOUSE.

03:23:18.986 --> 03:23:20.721
PROVIDING A HOME WE'RE NOT

03:23:20.788 --> 03:23:22.089

I'LL SEND YOU PORTANTINO I LIKE

03:24:09.070 --> 03:24:09.870
WHAT YOU'RE DOING ABSOLUTELY BUT

03:24:09.937 --> 03:24:11.105
THE WAY WE READ THE BILL IN OUR

03:24:11.172 --> 03:24:13.641
ANALYSIS IS THAT ALL YOU HAVE TO

03:24:13.708 --> 03:24:15.109
DO IS HAVE A PLAN.

03:24:15.176 --> 03:24:17.244
BUT YOU SAID YOU ACTUALLY HAVE

03:24:17.311 --> 03:24:18.512
TO MAKE A PLACEMENT SO I THINK

03:24:18.579 --> 03:24:20.548
THAT LOOKS TO BE.

03:24:20.615 --> 03:24:21.916
REALLY CLARIFIES.

03:24:21.983 --> 03:24:24.251
IN THE BILL AND WHAT I LIKE IS

03:24:24.318 --> 03:24:26.153
THE FACT THAT ALL OF THIS

03:24:26.220 --> 03:24:29.757
HOUSING ISSUES ABOUT THE HOME OF

03:24:29.824 --> 03:24:31.158
SO YOU'RE TAKING AN INDIVIDUAL.

03:24:31.225 --> 03:24:33.260
WHO'S HOMELESS AND PROVIDING A

03:24:33.327 --> 03:24:34.795
DOMICILE FOR THEM.

03:24:34.862 --> 03:24:36.364
ON A PERMANENT BASIS.

03:24:36.430 --> 03:24:39.266
AND WE KNOW FROM THE POINT --

03:24:39.333 --> 03:24:41.535
BECAUSE THE POINT.

03:24:41.602 --> 03:24:42.903
ACCOUNT.

03:24:42.970 --> 03:24:46.807
THAT A NUMBER OF OUR FOSTER KIDS.

03:24:46.874 --> 03:24:48.943
WHO ARE EMANCIPATED LET'S SAY

03:24:49.010 --> 03:24:51.379
FALL INTO THE THE DRUG CULTURE?

03:24:51.445 --> 03:24:53.214
AND THEY BECOME SUBSTANCE

03:24:53.280 --> 03:24:55.182
ABUSERS AND THEY'VE ALSO DEVELOP

03:24:55.249 --> 03:24:56.584
IF THEY DIDN'T ALREADY HAVE

03:24:56.651 --> 03:24:57.485
PHONE.

03:24:57.551 --> 03:25:00.054
HEALTH ISSUES WE HAVE THAT I

03:25:00.121 --> 03:25:01.489
MEAN THE SOBER LIVING HOMES

03:25:01.555 --> 03:25:03.924
PERFECT EXAMPLE SO I'M GOING TO

03:25:03.991 --> 03:25:05.059
SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY.

03:25:05.126 --> 03:25:07.495
BUT I'D LIKE YOU TO MAKE IT FIT

03:25:07.561 --> 03:25:09.196
MAKES IT TO THE FLOOR TO MAKE

03:25:09.263 --> 03:25:12.166
THAT CLEAR BECAUSE I DON'T THINK

03:25:12.233 --> 03:25:13.334
I THINK THAT FROM THE SKI

03:25:13.401 --> 03:25:14.435
PACKAGE WE JUST HAVE TO PUT A

03:25:14.502 --> 03:25:14.635
PLAN.

03:25:14.702 --> 03:25:15.703
NO NO NO IT'S MY INTENTION THAT

03:25:15.770 --> 03:25:16.871
YOU ONLY.

03:25:16.937 --> 03:25:19.740
GET THE FIVE FOR UP 25%.

03:25:19.807 --> 03:25:20.474
IT'S COMMENSURATE WITH THE

03:25:20.541 --> 03:25:22.209
ACTUAL NUMBER OF CHILDREN YOU

03:25:22.276 --> 03:25:24.578
PLACE IN HOMES SO YOU HAVE A

03:25:24.645 --> 03:25:26.180
LEANER REQUIREMENT.

03:25:26.247 --> 03:25:28.049
AND THEN YOU'RE ABLE TO COUNTING

03:25:28.115 --> 03:25:31.952
YOU HAVE TO REACH THE 5%.

03:25:32.019 --> 03:25:33.688
IF YOU HAVE THEM PLACE TO GET A

03:25:33.754 --> 03:25:35.823
5% UP TO FOUR AND YOU GET THE

03:25:35.890 --> 03:25:37.692
PERCENTAGE OF HOW MANY CHILDREN

03:25:37.758 --> 03:25:40.961
YOU ACTUALLY PLACE. 255% THAT

03:25:41.028 --> 03:25:43.097

RENO REQUIREMENTS GOT IT OKAY

03:25:44.565 --> 03:25:45.666

03:25:45.733 --> 03:25:49.036
HAVE TO PLACE AND IT'S VOLUNTARY

03:25:49.103 --> 03:25:50.638

FERGUSON REMOTEST THE SYSTEM

03:25:55.976 --> 03:25:57.445
THAT AND THAT IS THE IMPORTANT

03:25:57.511 --> 03:25:59.814
POINT PLACE NUMBER SERVICE NOT

03:25:59.880 --> 03:26:00.848
PLAN OR I'LL CLEAR THAT UP

03:26:00.915 --> 03:26:02.650

03:33:27.494 --> 03:33:28.629
THREE POINT FIVE MILLION HOMES

03:33:28.695 --> 03:33:30.063
WITHIN SEVEN YEARS SEEMS DON

03:33:30.130 --> 03:33:30.764
TEEN.

03:33:30.831 --> 03:33:32.065
BUT THIS AMBITIOUS GOAL SHOULD

03:33:32.132 --> 03:33:33.934
MOTIVATE US TO TAKE BOLD ACTION

03:33:34.001 --> 03:33:35.536
NOW.

03:33:35.602 --> 03:33:36.336
WE HAVE SEVERAL BARRIERS TO

03:33:36.403 --> 03:33:37.371
OVERCOME BUT WE SHOULDN'T

03:33:37.437 --> 03:33:38.805
UNDERESTIMATE ACCESSORY DWELLING

03:33:38.872 --> 03:33:40.774
UNITS AND SB THIRTEEN CAN HELP

03:33:40.841 --> 03:33:43.010
PROVIDE A VIABLE SOLUTION TO OUR

03:33:43.076 --> 03:33:44.678
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM.

03:33:44.745 --> 03:33:46.513
FOR EXAMPLE EIGHTY USE OUR

03:33:46.580 --> 03:33:48.482
FORMAL BY DESIGN BECAUSE LESS TO

03:33:48.549 --> 03:33:51.018
BUILD AND RUN FOR LESS AND THIS

03:33:51.084 --> 03:33:52.653
IS CRITICAL WHEN IN CALIFORNIA

03:33:52.719 --> 03:33:53.720
THE AVERAGE COST FOR HOUSING IS

03:33:53.787 --> 03:33:54.755
HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.

03:33:54.821 --> 03:33:56.657
AND EVEN MORE SO IN METROPOLITAN

03:33:56.723 --> 03:34:00.327
AREAS IN SAN FRANCISCO -- CLOSE

03:34:00.394 --> 03:34:00.961
TO SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

03:34:01.028 --> 03:34:02.563
DOLLARS.

03:34:02.629 --> 03:34:03.864
ACCORDING TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN

03:34:03.931 --> 03:34:06.099
TURNER CENTER REPORT ALMOST 60%

03:34:06.166 --> 03:34:07.334
OF EIGHTY YOU OWNERS READ TO THE

03:34:07.401 --> 03:34:09.937
UNITS AT BELOW MARKET RATES.

03:34:10.003 --> 03:34:11.338
AN ENTRY TO MARKET IS AN

03:34:11.405 --> 03:34:12.773
INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY THE

03:34:12.839 --> 03:34:13.407
MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA

03:34:13.473 --> 03:34:14.808
HOUSEHOLDS ARE SINGLE FAMILY

03:34:14.875 --> 03:34:15.876
HOMES.

03:34:15.943 --> 03:34:19.146
IF JUST 10% OF CALIFORNIA'S NINE

03:34:19.213 --> 03:34:20.948
MILLION. NINE MILLION OWNERS OF

03:34:21.014 --> 03:34:21.982
SINGLE FAMILY HOMES WERE TO

03:34:22.049 --> 03:34:23.617
CREATE EIGHTY USE THAT COULD

03:34:23.684 --> 03:34:26.620
EASILY AND QUICKLY ADD NINE

03:34:26.687 --> 03:34:27.187
HUNDRED THOUSAND MUCH NEEDED

03:34:27.254 --> 03:34:29.456
HOMES.

03:34:29.523 --> 03:34:30.390
ALTHOUGH WE MADE SOME PROGRESS

03:34:30.457 --> 03:34:32.626
IN LOWERING AT RESTRICTIONS FOR

03:34:32.693 --> 03:34:35.295
THE PASSAGE OF SB TEN SIXTY NINE

03:34:35.362 --> 03:34:36.697
WHICH WE WERE PROUD TO SPONSOR.

03:34:36.763 --> 03:34:37.864
SB THIRTEEN BUILT ON HIS

03:34:37.931 --> 03:34:39.633
LEGISLATION AND PROVIDES

03:34:39.700 --> 03:34:41.368
ADDITIONAL SOLUTIONS.

03:34:41.435 --> 03:34:42.669
AND TAXIS ARE MAJOR BURDEN FOR

03:34:42.736 --> 03:34:44.504
THE TYPICAL HOMEOWNER AND ARE

03:34:44.571 --> 03:34:45.439
DESIGNED FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION

03:34:45.505 --> 03:34:46.940
THAT TRIGGER INCREASE SERVICES

03:34:47.007 --> 03:34:48.242
AND UTILITIES.

03:34:48.308 --> 03:34:49.576
THE TIERED FEE REDUCTION

03:34:49.643 --> 03:34:51.478
PROPOSED IN SB THIRTEEN STRIKES

03:34:51.545 --> 03:34:52.679
A FAIR BALANCE FOR BOTH

03:34:52.746 --> 03:34:56.717
HOMEOWNERS AND AGENCIES.

03:34:56.783 --> 03:34:57.584
ELIMINATING A LOCAL REQUIREMENT

03:34:57.651 --> 03:35:00.254
OF OWNER OCCUPANCY IT'S ALSO KEY

03:35:00.320 --> 03:35:00.754
TO UNLOCKING ITS HOUSING

03:35:00.821 --> 03:35:01.555
SOLUTION.

03:35:01.622 --> 03:35:04.091
IN CALIFORNIA ALMOST TWO MILLION

03:35:04.157 --> 03:35:05.359

03:35:05.425 --> 03:35:06.893
OCCUPIED.

03:35:06.960 --> 03:35:08.028
THIS IS AN UNNECESSARY

03:35:08.095 --> 03:35:10.597
REQUIREMENT REDUCING OPTIONS FOR

03:35:10.664 --> 03:35:12.566
HOMEOWNERS AND RENTERS.

03:35:12.633 --> 03:35:14.134
IT'S FOR LEGISLATION WILL ADD

03:35:14.201 --> 03:35:15.736
THOUSANDS OF NEW HOMES TO

03:35:15.802 --> 03:35:17.638
CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING STOCK. FOR

03:35:17.704 --> 03:35:19.339
THESE REASONS AND MORE.

03:35:19.406 --> 03:35:27.180
COUNSEL IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB.

03:35:27.247 --> 03:35:27.848
THIRTEEN GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME

IS STEVEN ELSE I'M THE PRESENT

03:35:29.850 --> 03:35:31.018
OWNER OF VALLEY ON DEVELOPMENT

03:35:31.084 --> 03:35:33.053
AND EIGHTY YOU CONTRACTOR AND

03:35:33.120 --> 03:35:35.289
CREATIVITY YOU A EIGHTY YOU.

03:35:35.355 --> 03:35:38.191
CAN FACTORY COMPANY BASED IN

03:35:38.258 --> 03:35:40.460
FAIRFIELD CALIFORNIA -- WE'VE

03:35:40.527 --> 03:35:41.128
BEEN BUILDING A USE FOR THE PAST

03:35:41.194 --> 03:35:42.763
FOURTEEN YEARS.

03:35:42.829 --> 03:35:44.298
SO WE'RE VERY INTIMATE WITH THE

03:35:44.364 --> 03:35:47.567
PROCESS BOTH PRE AND POST --

03:35:47.634 --> 03:35:49.202
LEGISLATION CHANGES -- WE BUILT

03:35:49.269 --> 03:35:50.404
OVER  HUNDRED SEVENTY OF THEM

03:35:50.470 --> 03:35:52.239
ACROSS PROBABLY MORE THAN NINETY

03:35:52.306 --> 03:35:53.140
FIVE JURISDICTIONS.

03:35:53.206 --> 03:35:55.742
SO WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF DIFFERENT

03:35:55.809 --> 03:35:56.810
THINGS AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT

03:35:56.877 --> 03:35:58.879
PROBLEMS -- THEY GO WITH EIGHTY

03:35:58.945 --> 03:36:01.148
USE IN IN IN TERMS OF WHAT

03:36:01.214 --> 03:36:02.316
CITIES ARE GOOD AND WHAT CITIES

03:36:02.382 --> 03:36:03.483
ARE ARE BAD TO DEAL WITH.

03:36:03.550 --> 03:36:04.885
JUST A QUICK -- JUST A QUICK

03:36:04.951 --> 03:36:06.386
UNDERSTANDING WHAT WHAT EIGHTIES

03:36:06.453 --> 03:36:07.821
ARE ON THE TYPICALLY RANGE IN

03:36:07.888 --> 03:36:09.389
SIZE FROM ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY

03:36:09.456 --> 03:36:12.359
SQUARE FEET.

03:36:12.426 --> 03:36:12.959
ON UP TO ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED

03:36:13.026 --> 03:36:14.961
SQUARE FEET -- THEY CAN COST

03:36:15.028 --> 03:36:15.595
ANYWHERE FROM THE LOW IN FROM

03:36:15.662 --> 03:36:17.064
ABOUT SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND ON UP

03:36:17.130 --> 03:36:18.665
TO ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY

03:36:18.732 --> 03:36:19.399
THOUSAND DOLLARS SO THERE'S A

03:36:19.466 --> 03:36:21.234
THERE'S QUITE A RANGE OF BOTH IN

03:36:21.301 --> 03:36:23.403
SIZE AND PRICING.

03:36:23.470 --> 03:36:26.373
OF EIGHTY YEARS -- I'VE BEEN

03:36:26.440 --> 03:36:28.175
SITTING HERE MRS DAY LISTENING

03:36:28.241 --> 03:36:28.809
TO LOTS OF DISCUSSION ABOUT FOUR

03:36:28.875 --> 03:36:31.411
BY HOUSING -- I DON'T.

03:36:31.478 --> 03:36:32.813
I DON'T REALLY SEE ANY OTHER

03:36:32.879 --> 03:36:34.514
SOLUTIONS OUT THERE THAT CAN

03:36:34.581 --> 03:36:36.450
PERCENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNIT

03:36:36.516 --> 03:36:38.051
SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS I

03:36:38.118 --> 03:36:38.819
MEAN THERE'S JUST NOT A LOT OUT

03:36:38.885 --> 03:36:41.455
THERE -- I HEAR A LOT OF TALK I

03:36:41.521 --> 03:36:42.889
SEE A LOT.

03:36:42.956 --> 03:36:44.157
I WATCHED WHAT'S GOING ON WITH A

03:36:44.224 --> 03:36:44.925
LOT OF DIFFERENT BILLS.

03:36:44.991 --> 03:36:46.026
AND I SEE A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT

03:36:46.093 --> 03:36:48.095
HAPPENING AND YOU KNOW WHEN IT

03:36:48.161 --> 03:36:49.396
COMES RIGHT DOWN TO IT YOU KNOW

03:36:49.463 --> 03:36:51.698
MOST OF THE THE FOR ONE THOUSAND

03:36:51.765 --> 03:36:51.932
UNITS.

03:36:51.998 --> 03:36:54.167
STAR OFFICE PROBABLY ABOUT THREE

03:36:54.234 --> 03:36:54.735
HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND

03:36:54.801 --> 03:36:55.669
DOLLARS IN THE BAY AREA AND IT'S

03:36:55.736 --> 03:36:57.204
NOT UNCOMMON TO SEE AND

03:36:57.270 --> 03:36:58.271
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNIT HAVE A

03:36:58.338 --> 03:37:00.374
PRICE TAG OF EIGHT HUNDRED

03:37:00.440 --> 03:37:01.908
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE BAY AREA.

03:37:01.975 --> 03:37:05.078
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT A TO USE

03:37:05.145 --> 03:37:05.679
WERE LOOKING AT SOMETHING VERY

03:37:05.746 --> 03:37:06.580
UNIQUE.

03:37:06.646 --> 03:37:07.147
WE ALSO NEED TAKING

03:37:07.214 --> 03:37:07.748
CONSIDERATION THAT THESE HOMES

03:37:07.814 --> 03:37:09.683
DO NOT REQUIRE ANY SUBSIDIES SO

03:37:09.750 --> 03:37:11.451
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ANYTHING

03:37:11.518 --> 03:37:13.887
WHERE WE'RE ASKING STATE TO HAND

03:37:13.954 --> 03:37:15.722
OUT MONEY TO MAKE I IS HAPPEN.

03:37:15.789 --> 03:37:16.390
HOMEOWNERS HAVE THE INCENTIVE ON

03:37:16.456 --> 03:37:19.025
THEIR OWN EVERYBODY YOU KNOW.

03:37:19.092 --> 03:37:21.395
HAS SOMEBODY IN THEIR LIFE THAT

03:37:21.461 --> 03:37:22.863
COULD USE ONE OF THESE I CAN'T

03:37:22.929 --> 03:37:24.331
GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT SPARKING

03:37:24.398 --> 03:37:25.365
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT I DO FOR

03:37:25.432 --> 03:37:26.700
A LIVING AND GATHER A GROUP OF

03:37:26.767 --> 03:37:27.768
PEOPLE AROUND ME OR SHARE IN THE

03:37:27.834 --> 03:37:29.302
PROBLEMS.

03:37:29.369 --> 03:37:30.270
IN THIS IS JUST A IT'S IT'S JUST

03:37:30.337 --> 03:37:33.140
A PRODUCT THAT IS SO NEEDED.

03:37:33.206 --> 03:37:34.541
SO WITH THAT IN CONSIDERATION

03:37:34.608 --> 03:37:36.943
WHY ARE WE BUILDING ANYMORE.

03:37:37.010 --> 03:37:38.211
I MEAN WE WE SHOULD BE BUILDING

03:37:38.278 --> 03:37:39.780
TONS OF RIGHT I MEAN IT'S JUST

03:37:39.846 --> 03:37:42.149
IT THEY'RE THEY'RE AFFORDABLE --

03:37:42.215 --> 03:37:42.716
EVERYBODY NEEDS SOME HOMERS

03:37:42.783 --> 03:37:44.418
WANNA.

03:37:44.484 --> 03:37:44.985
WE SERVE IMPEDIMENTS I MEAN

03:37:45.051 --> 03:37:46.019
WE'RE STILL WHEN IT COMES RIGHT

03:37:46.086 --> 03:37:47.421
DOWN TO IT WHEN YOU TAKE WHEN

03:37:47.487 --> 03:37:49.456
YOU TAKE THAT EXAMPLE OF A SIXTY

03:37:49.523 --> 03:37:50.357
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR EIGHTY YOU.

03:37:50.424 --> 03:37:52.626
AND YOU TACK ON FORTY FIFTY

03:37:52.692 --> 03:37:53.260
THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF IMPACT

03:37:53.326 --> 03:37:54.194
FEES.

03:37:54.261 --> 03:37:55.262
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THAT

03:37:55.328 --> 03:37:56.763
HOME OR TO MAKE THAT DECISION.

03:37:56.830 --> 03:37:57.864
AND SAY YOU KNOW I WANNA GO AND

03:37:57.931 --> 03:37:59.399
PULL THE TRIGGER FOR SIXTY FIVE

03:37:59.466 --> 03:38:00.200
THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF ACTUAL

03:38:00.267 --> 03:38:02.202
PHYSICAL CONSTRUCTION.

03:38:02.269 --> 03:38:03.036
AND HERE.

03:38:03.103 --> 03:38:04.137
THE MAN OR MONEY THAT GOES

03:38:04.204 --> 03:38:05.338
NOWHERE IT'S IMPORTANT

03:38:05.405 --> 03:38:06.706
UNDERSTAND WHAT IMPACT FEES ARE

03:38:06.773 --> 03:38:07.474
BECAUSE WHEN WE LOOK AT IMPACT

03:38:07.541 --> 03:38:09.843
FEES WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY TALKING

03:38:09.910 --> 03:38:10.911
ABOUT THE BUILDING.

03:38:10.977 --> 03:38:12.512
PERMIT FEES OR THE THE

03:38:12.579 --> 03:38:14.414
APPLICATION REVIEW FEES THESE

03:38:14.481 --> 03:38:15.415
FEES ARE CHARGED INDEPENDENTLY

03:38:15.482 --> 03:38:16.416
BY THE PLANNING THE BUILDING

03:38:16.483 --> 03:38:17.217
DEPARTMENT.

03:38:17.284 --> 03:38:18.852
IMPACT FEES OF THOSE OF THE FEES

03:38:18.919 --> 03:38:19.386
ARE COMING FROM THE WATER

03:38:19.453 --> 03:38:20.253
DISTRICT.

03:38:20.320 --> 03:38:22.255
SCHOOL DISTRICT -- PARKS AND

03:38:22.322 --> 03:38:25.058
RACKS OF FIRE SANITATION

03:38:25.125 --> 03:38:28.695
DISTRICT -- SO SO END AND IT'S

03:38:28.762 --> 03:38:29.429
ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT

03:38:29.496 --> 03:38:30.363
THOSE FEES ARE ACTUALLY TO

03:38:30.430 --> 03:38:32.332
PROVIDE A NEW SERVICE TO THAT

03:38:32.399 --> 03:38:34.301
LOT THAT SERVICE READY EXISTS ON

03:38:34.367 --> 03:38:35.135
THE A LOT.

03:38:35.202 --> 03:38:36.269
IS READY HOME THERE AND AT THAT

03:38:36.336 --> 03:38:38.071
PRIMARY HOMES ALREADY PAID FOR

03:38:38.138 --> 03:38:39.339
THOSE SERVICES.

03:38:39.406 --> 03:38:40.407
ADDING TO THIS PROBLEM ON A

03:38:40.474 --> 03:38:42.075
DAILY BASIS WHAT WE SEE IS THAT

03:38:42.142 --> 03:38:43.810
WHEN WHEN PEOPLE ARE CONFRONTED

03:38:43.877 --> 03:38:45.445
WITH THE SITUATION.

03:38:45.512 --> 03:38:46.780
AND THE QUESTION COMES UP WHY

03:38:46.847 --> 03:38:52.252
DON'T I JUST DO IN ADDITION THAT.

03:38:52.319 --> 03:38:53.186
THAT VERY SAME ADDITION OF THE

03:38:53.253 --> 03:38:54.588
VERY SAME SIZE IS USUALLY NOT

03:38:54.654 --> 03:38:55.155
CHARGE THOSE IMPACT FEES.

03:38:55.222 --> 03:38:56.656
SO NOW WE HAVE THE SITUATION

03:38:56.723 --> 03:38:58.024
WHERE A HOMEOWNER IS DECIDING.

03:38:58.091 --> 03:38:58.925
WHETHER THEY SHOULD DO AN EIGHTY

03:38:58.992 --> 03:39:00.260
YOU OR THEY SHOULD JUST DO A

03:39:00.327 --> 03:39:00.894
SIMPLE ADDITION.

03:39:00.961 --> 03:39:01.962
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT WITH THAT

03:39:02.028 --> 03:39:03.363
SCENARIO IS THAT WERE

03:39:03.430 --> 03:39:04.831
DISCOURAGING THEM FROM ACTUALLY

03:39:04.898 --> 03:39:05.932
BUILDING AFFORDABLE UNIT.

03:39:05.999 --> 03:39:07.067
AND WE'RE ACTUALLY WE'RE

03:39:07.133 --> 03:39:08.735
ACTUALLY STEERING THEM TOWARDS A

03:39:08.802 --> 03:39:10.804
SOLUTION WHICH BASICALLY FURTHER

03:39:10.871 --> 03:39:12.305
EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM BY

CREATING MORE MAKE MANSIONS AND

03:39:14.007 --> 03:39:16.009
BIGGER HOMES THAT COST MORE AND

03:39:16.076 --> 03:39:16.643
MAKE THE DEVICE EVEN.

03:39:16.710 --> 03:39:18.778
FURTHER SO I THINK WE REALLY

03:39:18.845 --> 03:39:21.214

03:39:23.617 --> 03:39:25.352
WAYS TO REDUCE THOSE FEES AND

03:39:25.418 --> 03:39:26.152
MAKE IT EASIER ON THE CONSUMER

03:39:26.219 --> 03:39:27.420
MAKE A RELATIVE TO THE ACTUAL

03:39:27.487 --> 03:39:30.390
COST THAT THE BURDEN WITH FOR

03:39:30.457 --> 03:39:31.024
THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION OF THAT

03:39:31.091 --> 03:39:33.260
UNIT.

03:39:33.326 --> 03:39:34.194
ON A TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND

03:39:34.261 --> 03:39:35.562

03:39:40.834 --> 03:39:41.835
APPROPRIATE.

03:39:41.902 --> 03:39:43.036

03:39:45.939 --> 03:39:48.074
POINT ON THAT IT'S IT'S IT'S

IT'S BROUGHT UP IN A LOT OF

03:39:49.175 --> 03:39:50.977

THOUSAND EIGHTY YEARS.

03:40:06.660 --> 03:40:07.394
AND WHAT ALL FOUR OF THEM HAVE

03:40:07.460 --> 03:40:09.229
IN COMMON THEY DON'T HAVE

03:40:09.296 --> 03:40:10.931
DEMOCRACY REQUIREMENTS.

03:40:10.997 --> 03:40:11.998

GUESS YOU COULD SAY THAT SB

03:41:26.239 --> 03:41:27.007
THIRTEEN IS AND THE WORK THAT

SENATOR WHITE HOUSE HE HAS DONE

03:41:28.308 --> 03:41:30.176
TO SLIM DOWN -- SOME OF THE

03:41:30.243 --> 03:41:31.077
CHANGES THAT WERE INITIALLY

03:41:31.144 --> 03:41:33.046
PROPOSED IN PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF

03:41:33.113 --> 03:41:34.381
THE BILL -- WE DO REALLY

03:41:34.447 --> 03:41:35.849
APPRECIATE THAT AND SO FROM THAT

03:41:35.915 --> 03:41:37.183
STARTING POINT PERHAPS WERE NOT

03:41:37.250 --> 03:41:39.219
AS FAR APART ON SOME OF THE

03:41:39.285 --> 03:41:39.819
CONCERNS THAT WE CONTINUE TO

03:41:39.886 --> 03:41:40.620
HAVE.

03:41:40.687 --> 03:41:42.922
A GENERALLY SPEAKING A PA I'M IS

03:41:42.989 --> 03:41:44.457
CONCERNED THAT WE DO SEE ANNUAL

03:41:44.524 --> 03:41:46.526
CHANGES BEING PROPOSED EACH YEAR

03:41:46.593 --> 03:41:48.795
TO THE EIGHTY LAW -- WE DO KNOW

03:41:48.862 --> 03:41:50.463
AS EVERYBODY HAS -- SCENE THAT

03:41:50.530 --> 03:41:52.132
WE HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE

03:41:52.198 --> 03:41:54.167
IN I'M AT PROTECT PRODUCTION

03:41:54.234 --> 03:41:55.568
OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WITH THE

03:41:55.635 --> 03:41:57.037
CHANGES IN.

03:41:57.103 --> 03:41:57.971
TWENTY SIXTEEN I MEAN WE DO JUST

03:41:58.038 --> 03:41:59.639
GET CONCERNED WITH GOING BACK

03:41:59.706 --> 03:42:01.141
REVISING THOSE ORDINANCES THAT

03:42:01.207 --> 03:42:03.243
EVERYBODY HAS ALREADY ADOPTED OR

03:42:03.309 --> 03:42:05.245
IS IN THE PROCESS OF OF DOING

03:42:05.311 --> 03:42:07.113
BUT AGAIN A PEAK IS NOT OPPOSED

03:42:07.180 --> 03:42:08.481
EIGHTY USE WE DON'T WANT TO PUT.

03:42:08.548 --> 03:42:09.683
ANY RESTRICTIONS OR WE DON'T

03:42:09.749 --> 03:42:10.917
WANT THINGS TO BE IN PLACE THAT

03:42:10.984 --> 03:42:12.285
LIMIT A D. AS WE JUST THINK THAT

03:42:12.352 --> 03:42:13.286
THERE DOES NEED TO BE SOME

03:42:13.353 --> 03:42:14.754
PARAMETERS AROUND CERTAIN THINGS

03:42:14.821 --> 03:42:15.321
AND SO.

03:42:15.388 --> 03:42:16.790
ON THE ISSUE OF HONOR OCCUPANCY

03:42:16.856 --> 03:42:18.024
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S PROBABLY

03:42:18.091 --> 03:42:19.426
THE BIGGEST CONCERN I THINK APA

03:42:19.492 --> 03:42:21.194
HAS AND ONE THAT CERTAINLY IS

03:42:21.261 --> 03:42:21.828
NEAR AND DEAR TO SENATOR WHITE

03:42:21.895 --> 03:42:23.797
HOUSE SKI -- WE ARE JUST

03:42:23.863 --> 03:42:25.999
GENERALLY CONCERNS THAT -- WITH

03:42:26.066 --> 03:42:28.034
THE REMOVAL AS OWNER OCCUPANCY

03:42:28.101 --> 03:42:29.369
AS A TOOL FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

03:42:29.436 --> 03:42:32.939
AND THAT IS -- THE ABILITY TO BE

03:42:33.006 --> 03:42:34.441
ABLE TO REQUIRE HONOR OCCUPANCY --

03:42:34.507 --> 03:42:36.576
THE MORE LIKELIHOOD OF AN OWNER

03:42:36.643 --> 03:42:37.777
THAT IS -- RESIDING IN THEIR

03:42:37.844 --> 03:42:38.878
DWELLING WHETHER IT'S THE DO YOU

03:42:38.945 --> 03:42:41.381
OR THE THE MAIN UNIT.

03:42:41.448 --> 03:42:42.248
THAT WILL MORE THAN LIKELY

03:42:42.315 --> 03:42:44.017
HOPEFULLY RENT OUT THEIR UNIT

03:42:44.084 --> 03:42:45.885
FOR A MORE AFFORDABLE RENT AND

03:42:45.952 --> 03:42:46.519
WE'RE CONCERNED THAT REMOVING

03:42:46.586 --> 03:42:48.288
THOSE -- OWNER OCCUPANCY

03:42:48.354 --> 03:42:50.090
RESTRICTIONS OUR ABILITY -- FROM

03:42:50.156 --> 03:42:51.157
THE BILL DOES POTENTIALLY

03:42:51.224 --> 03:42:53.259
INCENTIVIZE INVESTORS TO COME IN

03:42:53.326 --> 03:42:55.328
AND EITHER RENTS HOW IT'S

03:42:55.395 --> 03:42:57.597
PURCHASE A LOT WITH AN EIGHTY

03:42:57.664 --> 03:42:59.299
YOU OR AT AN EIGHTY OR I'D BOTH --

03:42:59.365 --> 03:43:00.700
AND THEN RENT THEM OUT FOR

03:43:00.767 --> 03:43:01.701
WHATEVER THE MARKET WILL BILL

03:43:01.768 --> 03:43:03.103
BEAR AND WE DON'T WE DON'T WANT

03:43:03.169 --> 03:43:04.671
TO SEE THAT WE KNOW THAT SOME

03:43:04.738 --> 03:43:06.039
JURISDICTIONS DO USE OWNER OF

03:43:06.106 --> 03:43:09.175
ORDER OCCUPANCY AS A TOOL TO

03:43:09.242 --> 03:43:09.375
THAN.

03:43:09.442 --> 03:43:15.715
A PLACE AFFORDABILITY

03:43:15.782 --> 03:43:16.850
RESTRICTIONS ON THE UNIT SO THAT

03:43:16.916 --> 03:43:17.951
IF ON OCCUPANCY IS NOT REQUIRED

03:43:18.017 --> 03:43:18.718
FOR EXAMPLE SANTA ROSA WILL

03:43:18.785 --> 03:43:19.385
WAIVE UNDER OCCUPANCY

03:43:19.452 --> 03:43:19.819
REQUIREMENTS.

03:43:19.886 --> 03:43:20.487
I KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE

03:43:20.553 --> 03:43:21.121
ARE OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT DO

03:43:21.187 --> 03:43:22.088
HAVE OTHER HARDSHIP WAIVERS IN

03:43:22.155 --> 03:43:22.989
THE EVENT THAT THE OWNER MOVES

03:43:23.056 --> 03:43:24.257
OUT OF THE IS THE MAIN OR THE X.

03:43:24.324 --> 03:43:25.859
AT THE EIGHTY YEAR OLD -- OR

03:43:25.925 --> 03:43:27.193
NEEDS TO MOVE FOR WORK RELATED

03:43:27.260 --> 03:43:28.762
REASONS WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT

03:43:28.828 --> 03:43:30.130
THERE'S BEEN SOME ISSUES WITH

03:43:30.196 --> 03:43:32.065
FINANCING ON OWNER OCCUPANCY --

03:43:32.132 --> 03:43:33.666
WE REALLY DON'T WANT THAT TO BE --

03:43:33.733 --> 03:43:35.368
THE IMPEDIMENT TO THE TO BEING

03:43:35.435 --> 03:43:36.536

THERE ARE HARDSHIP WAIVERS AND

03:43:43.877 --> 03:43:45.078
THERE IS THE ABILITY TO REQUIRE

03:43:45.145 --> 03:43:47.080
THAT BUT HOPEFULLY WE CAN

03:43:47.147 --> 03:43:48.515
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE

03:43:48.581 --> 03:43:49.916
AND AND FOR THE REASONS I'VE

03:43:49.983 --> 03:43:53.253

03:45:05.325 --> 03:45:07.560
FOR RENTAL PER FOR FOR SHORT

03:45:07.627 --> 03:45:09.162
TERM RENTAL PURPOSES.

03:45:09.229 --> 03:45:10.296
NO NOT IN THE HERE WE'RE LEAVING

03:45:10.363 --> 03:45:11.231
THAT UP TO THE LOCAL

03:45:11.297 --> 03:45:12.999
JURISDICTIONS THEY'RE ALL OVER

03:45:13.066 --> 03:45:14.767
THE BOARD OF WHAT THEY WANT

03:45:14.834 --> 03:45:16.102
LIMóN IT DOESN'T [inaudible]

03:45:16.169 --> 03:45:18.771
I'M AGNOSTIC.

03:45:18.838 --> 03:45:20.306
YEAH I GUESS I WANT TO URGE YOU

03:45:20.373 --> 03:45:22.775
NOT TO BE AGNOSTIC ON THIS --

03:45:22.842 --> 03:45:23.943
ONE IF WE'RE GONNA COUNTED AS

03:45:24.010 --> 03:45:25.712
PART OF OUR RENEWED NUMBERS AND

03:45:25.778 --> 03:45:27.614
I THINK IT SHOULD FRANKLY -- I

03:45:27.680 --> 03:45:29.849
THINK IT IT SHOULD BE RESTRICTED

03:45:29.916 --> 03:45:30.984
BUT THAT'S JUST MY TWO CENTS

03:45:31.050 --> 03:45:31.551
WORK THE NIGHT I PUT THAT IN

03:45:31.618 --> 03:45:33.052
THERE.

03:45:33.119 --> 03:45:34.520
ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR

03:45:34.587 --> 03:45:35.855
QUESTIONS COLLEAGUES SENATOR

03:45:35.922 --> 03:45:41.661
SKINNER -- I JUST NOTE THAT THE

03:45:41.728 --> 03:45:44.197
A. P. A.'S PART OF THEIR

03:45:44.264 --> 03:45:45.398
OPPOSITION WAS THE FACT THAT.

03:45:45.465 --> 03:45:46.532
PEOPLE THAT ARE LOCAL

03:45:46.599 --> 03:45:47.367
GOVERNMENTS WOULD HAVE TO ONCE

03:45:47.433 --> 03:45:48.935
AGAIN REVISED THEIR AID YOU

03:45:49.002 --> 03:45:50.503
ORDINANCES HAD WE BEEN

03:45:50.570 --> 03:45:52.305
SUCCESSFUL LAST YEAR AS WE HAD

03:45:52.372 --> 03:45:53.573
ATTEMPTED.

03:45:53.640 --> 03:45:54.674
TO THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN REVISING

03:45:54.741 --> 03:45:56.309
THEIR ORDINANCES AT THE SAME

03:45:56.376 --> 03:45:57.477
TIME AND ALL TOGETHER.

03:45:57.543 --> 03:45:59.913
SO IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT.

03:45:59.979 --> 03:46:02.382
THE BILLS -- GOT HUNG UP LAST

03:46:02.448 --> 03:46:05.385
YEAR BUT I THINK THIS IS VERY

03:46:05.451 --> 03:46:07.153
VERY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF IT'S

03:46:07.220 --> 03:46:12.158
MUCH EASIER [inaudible] TO GIVEN

03:46:12.225 --> 03:46:13.526
THAT WE HAVE EXISTING

03:46:13.593 --> 03:46:15.762
RESIDENTIAL UNITS.

03:46:15.828 --> 03:46:18.431
AN EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. TO

03:46:18.498 --> 03:46:20.533
ADD ANOTHER RESIDENTIAL UNIT IS

03:46:20.600 --> 03:46:24.237
MUCH EASIER THAN STARTING AGAIN.

03:46:24.304 --> 03:46:25.638
WITH NEW CONSTRUCTION WHETHER

03:46:25.705 --> 03:46:27.407
IT'S THROUGH ANY OF OUR OTHER.

03:46:27.473 --> 03:46:29.342
BILLS THAT WE KNOW WE'RE GOING

03:46:29.409 --> 03:46:31.110
TO NEED TO DO THOSE BUT THEY

03:46:31.177 --> 03:46:32.478
IT'S GOING TO TAKE MUCH LONGER.

03:46:32.545 --> 03:46:34.280
SO IN TERMS OF THIS HOUSING

03:46:34.347 --> 03:46:36.416
CRISIS THIS IS VERY NEEDED BUT I

03:46:36.482 --> 03:46:38.117
DO SEE HERE DISCOVER YEARS

03:46:38.184 --> 03:46:39.919
CONCERNING THAT I WANT THESE

03:46:39.986 --> 03:46:41.087
ADDITIONAL UNITS TO COUNT

03:46:41.154 --> 03:46:42.155
TOWARDS ARENA.

03:46:42.221 --> 03:46:45.425
I WANT THEM NOT TO BE.

03:46:45.491 --> 03:46:46.926
SHORT TERM.

03:46:46.993 --> 03:46:49.495
AND I ALSO THINK.

03:46:49.562 --> 03:46:51.597
THE WHILE.

03:46:51.664 --> 03:46:54.133
REQUIRING OWNER OCCUPANCY IS TOO

03:46:54.200 --> 03:46:56.936
ONEROUS I THINK SOMETHING LIKE

03:46:57.003 --> 03:46:58.838
THAT.

03:46:58.905 --> 03:47:00.873
THAT MINIMIZES THE SPECULATIVE

03:47:00.940 --> 03:47:02.742
VALUE SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE A

03:47:02.809 --> 03:47:04.143
MOTIVATION.

03:47:04.210 --> 03:47:05.712
FOR THESE -- HOUSING

03:47:05.778 --> 03:47:07.613
CORPORATIONS LIKE WHAT HAPPENED

03:47:07.680 --> 03:47:08.982
IN SACRAMENTO WE HAVE A COUPLE

03:47:09.048 --> 03:47:10.917
CORPORATION STEP BOUGHT UP

03:47:10.984 --> 03:47:12.618
SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF SINGLE

03:47:12.685 --> 03:47:17.023
FAMILY HOMES -- AND THEN OUR

03:47:17.090 --> 03:47:18.925
RAINING IN THE MET QUITE HIGH

03:47:18.992 --> 03:47:21.561
PRICES AND SO.

03:47:21.627 --> 03:47:24.197
SOME LEVEL YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S

03:47:24.263 --> 03:47:29.702
A RESTRICTION ON OF A YOU KNOW

03:47:29.769 --> 03:47:32.305
LARGE LARGER CORPORATE OWNERS%

03:47:32.372 --> 03:47:34.340
BUT ANYWAY OTHER NAT I THINK

03:47:34.407 --> 03:47:37.243
IT'S A GREAT DEAL.

03:47:37.310 --> 03:47:38.244
CAN I MOVE IT.

03:47:38.311 --> 03:47:41.948
OKAY WITH MOTION -- I I WILL SAY

03:47:42.015 --> 03:47:43.383

03:47:43.449 --> 03:47:44.951
I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR TAKING

03:47:45.018 --> 03:47:46.386

I WANTED TO SAY THERE ARE AS

03:47:55.028 --> 03:47:56.396
SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN INVOLVED IN

03:47:56.462 --> 03:47:58.831
HOUSING -- POLICY AND POLITICS

03:47:58.898 --> 03:48:03.236
FOR A LONG TIME THERE ARE -- A

03:48:03.302 --> 03:48:05.371
LOT A LOT OF ASPECTS OF HOUSING

03:48:05.438 --> 03:48:07.306
POLICY POLITICS IN CALIFORNIA

03:48:07.373 --> 03:48:07.974
THAT ARE UPSETTING TO ME IN

03:48:08.041 --> 03:48:10.243
TERMS OF WHAT WE'VE DONE IN

03:48:10.309 --> 03:48:11.644
TERMS OF MAKING IT HARD TO

03:48:11.711 --> 03:48:13.079
CREATE HOUSING AND HAVING

03:48:13.146 --> 03:48:14.514
CHILDREN SLEEPING IN CARS AND

03:48:14.580 --> 03:48:16.616
YOUNG PEOPLE CAN'T MOVE BACK TO

03:48:16.682 --> 03:48:18.051
THE COMMUNITY GREW UP IN.

03:48:18.117 --> 03:48:20.286
A VERY TOUGH SITUATION THERE ARE

03:48:20.353 --> 03:48:22.822
A FEW THINGS THAT REALLY BUG ME

03:48:22.889 --> 03:48:25.158
MORE THAN WHAT WE HAVE ALLOWED

03:48:25.224 --> 03:48:27.126
CITIES TO DO IN TERMS OF FEEDING

03:48:27.193 --> 03:48:30.730
THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. TO ALLOW.

03:48:30.797 --> 03:48:32.899
YOU TO USE IT WAS I AM THIRTY

03:48:32.965 --> 03:48:34.434
FIVE YEARS AGO THE STATE OF

03:48:34.500 --> 03:48:35.968
CALIFORNIA PASSED A LAW THEY

03:48:36.035 --> 03:48:38.438
SAID YOU HAVE TO LET PEOPLE PUT

03:48:38.504 --> 03:48:39.439
EIGHTY USE.

03:48:39.505 --> 03:48:40.973
IN THEIR HOMES PERIOD.

03:48:41.040 --> 03:48:42.975
AND FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS CITIES

03:48:43.042 --> 03:48:44.844
IN THE STATE INCLUDING BY CITY

03:48:44.911 --> 03:48:47.713
OF SAN FRANCISCO HAVE FLOUTED

03:48:47.780 --> 03:48:48.748
THAT LAW.

03:48:48.815 --> 03:48:54.020
NOR TO HAVE VIOLATED THE LAW.

03:48:54.087 --> 03:48:55.354
AND THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE WHEN

03:48:55.421 --> 03:48:56.522
WE LOOK AT THE HOUSING SHORTAGE

03:48:56.589 --> 03:48:58.257
WE HAVE THE EFFICIENCY OF

03:48:58.324 --> 03:49:00.259
PUTTING IN LAW UNITS AND NOW

03:49:00.326 --> 03:49:01.394
YOU'RE NOT.

03:49:01.461 --> 03:49:02.261
YOU KNOW GETTING INTO HIGH

03:49:02.328 --> 03:49:03.696
IMBOLC ISSUES THAT PEOPLE

03:49:03.763 --> 03:49:05.965
SOMETIMES ARE UNHAPPY ABOUT WITH

03:49:06.032 --> 03:49:07.100
NEW DEVELOPMENT.

03:49:07.166 --> 03:49:09.335
AND YET WE HAVE ALLOWED CITIES

03:49:09.402 --> 03:49:12.271
INCLUDING MY OWN TO OBEY THE LAW --

03:49:12.338 --> 03:49:14.073
I WANTED HIM TO IN TERMS OF THE

03:49:14.140 --> 03:49:15.641
EPA'S COMMENT THAT WHILE GOD

03:49:17.110 --> 03:49:18.344
WEATHER CHANGES EVERY YEAR

03:49:18.411 --> 03:49:19.712
BECAUSE THIS IS TURNED INTO A

03:49:19.779 --> 03:49:20.813
CAT AND MOUSE GAME.

03:49:20.880 --> 03:49:22.348
WERE IN THE LEGISLATURE SAYS YOU

03:49:22.415 --> 03:49:24.016

03:49:24.083 --> 03:49:26.486
THEN NOT ALL BUT A LOT OF CITIES

03:49:26.552 --> 03:49:29.088
FIND WAYS TO MAKE IT TOO

03:49:29.155 --> 03:49:31.157
EXPENSIVE OR IMPOSSIBLE TO

03:49:31.224 --> 03:49:33.659

AROUND ARE HOMELESS.

03:52:40.546 --> 03:52:41.314
IN THAT.

03:52:41.380 --> 03:52:43.182
THAT INCREASE THE MAJORITY OF

03:52:43.249 --> 03:52:45.084
THEM.

03:52:45.151 --> 03:52:46.952
WERE NEWLY HOMELESS NEVER BEEN

03:52:47.019 --> 03:52:48.220
HOMES BEFORE.

03:52:48.287 --> 03:52:49.822
HAD JOBS.

03:52:49.889 --> 03:52:52.091
AND MANY OF THEM HAVE JOBS NOT

03:52:52.158 --> 03:52:53.492
HAD HALF HAVE JOBS.

03:52:53.559 --> 03:52:57.029
AND MANY OF THEM HAVE CHILDREN.

03:52:57.096 --> 03:52:58.297
SO THESE ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:52:58.364 --> 03:53:00.700
MENTALLY ILL OR ADDICTED THESE

03:53:00.766 --> 03:53:02.968
ARE PEOPLE THAT JUST.

03:53:03.035 --> 03:53:04.270
FROM.

03:53:04.337 --> 03:53:05.838
BECAUSE THEY WERE PAYING MORE

03:53:05.905 --> 03:53:09.108
THAN 50% POTENTIALLY.

03:53:09.175 --> 03:53:12.712
OF THEIR INCOME ON RENT.

03:53:12.778 --> 03:53:14.814
FACE TO DIFFICULTY MANY OF THEM

03:53:14.880 --> 03:53:16.849
WERE NOT EVEN AFFECTED STATE

03:53:16.916 --> 03:53:19.585
LEFT THEIR PLACE BEFORE BEING

03:53:19.652 --> 03:53:20.786
AFFECTED.

03:53:20.853 --> 03:53:22.355
BECAUSE TO HAVE AN EVICTION ON

03:53:22.421 --> 03:53:23.489
YOUR RECORD ALMOST MAKES IT

03:53:23.556 --> 03:53:25.891
IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RENT AGAIN.

03:53:25.958 --> 03:53:28.327
SO USE MANY TENANTS WILL LEAVE.

03:53:28.394 --> 03:53:30.229
BEFORE THEIR AFFECTED AS SOON AS

03:53:30.296 --> 03:53:33.199
THEY'RE ENOUGH LATE IN THEIR

03:53:33.265 --> 03:53:34.433
RENT ENOUGH MONTHS.

03:53:34.500 --> 03:53:36.569
SO WHAT SB EIGHTEEN WILL DO IS

03:53:36.635 --> 03:53:38.604
INCREASE [inaudible]

03:53:38.671 --> 03:53:40.773
CALIFORNIA'S FIND WE HAVE AN

03:53:40.840 --> 03:53:42.441
EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE FUND

03:53:42.508 --> 03:53:44.076
NOW.

03:53:44.143 --> 03:53:45.177
SO IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL OWN

03:53:45.244 --> 03:53:47.146
APPROPRIATION WILL INCREASE THAT

03:53:47.213 --> 03:53:49.815
FUND SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE.

03:53:49.882 --> 03:53:53.085
MORE EMERGENCY OR RATHER WE CAN

03:53:53.152 --> 03:53:54.954
PROVIDE EMERGENCY RENTAL

03:53:55.020 --> 03:53:56.789
ASSISTANCE TO MORE TENANTS.

03:53:56.856 --> 03:53:58.524
THIS IS PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE TO

03:53:58.591 --> 03:54:00.159
PREVENT HOMELESSNESS AND

03:54:00.226 --> 03:54:02.995
ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD INCREASE

03:54:03.062 --> 03:54:04.230
THE LEGAL FUNDS THAT WE HAVE

03:54:04.296 --> 03:54:06.132
AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE SOME LEGAL

03:54:06.198 --> 03:54:07.933
ASSISTANCE.

03:54:08.000 --> 03:54:09.635
BECAUSE IN SOME CASES THE

03:54:09.702 --> 03:54:10.469
TENANTS DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR

03:54:10.536 --> 03:54:12.304
RIGHTS ARE AND WE CAN AVOID WE

03:54:12.371 --> 03:54:13.973
CAN KEEP THEM IN THEIR HOME JUST

03:54:14.039 --> 03:54:15.408
WITH SOME LEVEL OF LEGAL

03:54:15.474 --> 03:54:16.308
ASSISTANCE.

03:54:16.375 --> 03:54:18.544
BUT MY PRIORITY FOCUSES ON THE

03:54:18.611 --> 03:54:20.146
EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE.

03:54:20.212 --> 03:54:21.747
AND ADDITIONALLY IT HAS SOME

03:54:21.814 --> 03:54:23.949
OTHER COMPONENTS BUT I WILL

03:54:24.016 --> 03:54:26.919
ALLOW MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TO

03:54:26.986 --> 03:54:28.754

IS ANOTHER PIECE THAT IS REALLY

03:55:22.141 --> 03:55:24.610
IMPORTANT TO FIND -- PREVENTION

03:55:24.677 --> 03:55:27.213
IS THE LEAST COSTLY AND THE MOST

03:55:27.279 --> 03:55:28.414

FOR THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR

04:00:33.819 --> 04:00:36.321
BUT ON THE PROBLEM -- THERE WAS

04:00:36.388 --> 04:00:37.956
CONCERN.

04:00:38.023 --> 04:00:39.725
EXPRESSED THAT.

04:00:39.792 --> 04:00:41.693

REGARDS TO THE FINDS IT WOULD

04:02:46.451 --> 04:02:47.920
COME FROM THIS C. S. H..

04:02:47.986 --> 04:02:49.388
AND THE IT LOOKS LIKE THE

04:02:49.454 --> 04:02:52.090
RECOMMENDATION IS THEY GO TO THE

04:02:52.157 --> 04:02:52.758
CONTINUUM OF CARE.

04:02:52.824 --> 04:02:54.726
AND I'VE I'VE HAD SOME CONCERNS

04:02:54.793 --> 04:02:56.194
THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IN MY

04:02:56.261 --> 04:02:59.331
COUNTIES AROUND -- THE LACK OF

04:02:59.398 --> 04:03:01.099
OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND

04:03:01.166 --> 04:03:03.068
TRANSPARENCY IN SOME OF THE SOME

04:03:03.135 --> 04:03:04.636
OF THE COMMUNITY OF KERR'S SO I

04:03:04.703 --> 04:03:05.904
JUST WANT TO RAISE THAT IS AN

04:03:05.971 --> 04:03:08.173
ISSUE BECAUSE WE ALSO TOOK THE

04:03:08.240 --> 04:03:09.308
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR

04:03:09.374 --> 04:03:10.876

04:03:13.478 --> 04:03:15.814
WITH THIS ACTUALLY SETTING GOALS

04:03:15.881 --> 04:03:17.582
SO THAT WE HAVE A WAY TO KNOW

04:03:17.649 --> 04:03:18.917
WHETHER THE MONEY IS REALLY

04:03:18.984 --> 04:03:21.053
GOING TO WHAT WE WANTED TO GO TO

04:03:21.119 --> 04:03:23.789
SO I I RAISE THAT I I AM GOING

04:03:23.855 --> 04:03:25.490
TO BE TALKING ABOUT THAT MORE IN

04:03:25.557 --> 04:03:25.791
THE FUTURE.

04:03:25.857 --> 04:03:27.626
