JURISDICTION- IS CLASSIFIED IN

00:36:11.802 --> 00:36:13.871
ONE OF THESE TWO ZONES ARE A

00:36:13.938 --> 00:36:14.739
LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND WE

00:36:14.805 --> 00:36:16.073
PERFORMED A DETAILED WORKLOAD

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:18.409
ANALYSIS- BASED ON AVERAGE HOME

00:36:18.476 --> 00:36:19.577

RESPONSIBILITY AREA I WE

00:36:22.613 --> 00:36:24.982
ESTIMATE THAT. JUST UNDER

00:36:25.049 --> 00:36:25.550
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND HOMES I

00:36:25.616 --> 00:36:27.552
WILL BE SOLD I EACH YEAR WITHIN

00:36:27.618 --> 00:36:29.053
OUR JURISDICTION REQUIREMENT

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.955
INDEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTION

00:36:31.022 --> 00:36:32.290
TO DEMONSTRATE THAT CAN

00:36:32.356 --> 00:36:33.991
REQUIRED COMPLIANCE- WITH THESE

00:36:34.058 --> 00:36:35.893
NEW DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:36.861
NOW THERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS

00:36:36.928 --> 00:36:38.529
ARE RAISED A REGARDING IMPOSING

00:36:38.596 --> 00:36:40.398
A FEE FOR THESE INSPECTIONS AND

00:36:40.464 --> 00:36:43.100
EVEN POSSIBLY TO FIND WORK ACT

00:36:43.167 --> 00:36:44.669
FOR US TO CLEAR OF VEGETATION

00:36:44.735 --> 00:36:46.837
FOR HOMEOWNERS THAT ARE ODD NON

00:36:46.904 --> 00:36:49.440
COMPLIANT- WE APPRECIATE TO A

00:36:49.507 --> 00:36:51.275
VERY MUCH OF THIS DISCUSSION-

00:36:51.342 --> 00:36:53.210
BUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE- THAT IS

00:36:53.277 --> 00:36:54.812
NECESSARY AT THIS TIME FOR

00:36:54.879 --> 00:36:56.547
SEVERAL REASONS- FIRST. OUR

00:36:56.614 --> 00:36:58.416
BASE DEFENSIBLE SPACE PROGRAM

00:36:58.482 --> 00:37:00.251
HAS FOUND GREATEST COMPLIANCE

00:37:00.318 --> 00:37:02.119
THROUGH EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY

00:37:02.186 --> 00:37:04.288
OUTREACH ARE INSPECTORS SECOND

00:37:04.355 --> 00:37:05.790
WALK HOMEOWNERS THROUGH THE

00:37:05.856 --> 00:37:07.592
EASY STEPS ARE THAT IT TAKES TO

00:37:07.658 --> 00:37:09.760
GAIN COMPLIANCE AND IT'S PART

00:37:09.827 --> 00:37:10.595
OF HER JOB TO PROVIDE

00:37:10.661 --> 00:37:12.330
INFORMATION. TO THE HOMEOWNERS

00:37:12.396 --> 00:37:13.998
THAT REALLY EXPLAINS WHY IT'S

00:37:14.065 --> 00:37:15.533
IN THE BEST INTEREST FOR THE

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.934
HOMEOWNER TO MAINTAIN

00:37:17.001 --> 00:37:17.935
DEFENSIBLE SPRAYS TO PROTECT

00:37:18.002 --> 00:37:19.704
THEIR OWN HOME- AND TO PROTECT

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:21.806
THEIR FAMILY. YEAH IN FACT WE

00:37:21.872 --> 00:37:22.273
FIND THAT AFTER THESE

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:23.841
EDUCATIONAL INSPECTIONS WE

00:37:23.908 --> 00:37:25.676
ACHIEVE A VERY HIGH COMPLIANCE

00:37:25.743 --> 00:37:27.578
RATES. IN THE PROGRAM BEFORE

00:37:27.645 --> 00:37:29.013
YOU TODAY A HOMEOWNER IS

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.815
MOTIVATED TO SELL THEIR HOME-

00:37:30.881 --> 00:37:34.986
SO WE FEEL THAT. COMPLIANCE IS

00:37:35.052 --> 00:37:35.553
ACTUALLY GONNA BE RELATIVELY

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:36.120
HIGH I- UPON OUR INSPECTION

00:37:36.187 --> 00:37:37.188
THESE NEED A REALIST TO SLOW.

00:37:37.254 --> 00:37:40.024
INSPECTIONS LASTLY THE COST IN

00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:41.993
RESOURCES TO ADMINISTER A NEW

00:37:42.059 --> 00:37:44.295
FEE PROGRAM WE BELIEVE.

00:37:44.362 --> 00:37:46.697
OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS GAINED BY

00:37:46.764 --> 00:37:47.999
THE WORK THAT THAT WE WOULD

00:37:48.065 --> 00:37:50.034
HAVE TO PERFORM. AND SO BASED

00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:51.602
ON OUR COMPLIANCE RATES BASED

00:37:51.669 --> 00:37:53.270
ON THE COST TO CONTRACT- FOR

00:37:53.337 --> 00:37:55.139
DEFENSIBLE SPACE WORK- WHICH

00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:56.540
COULD EASILY RUN BY THE WAY

00:37:56.607 --> 00:37:58.409
ANYWHERE FROM THREE TO FIVE

00:37:58.476 --> 00:37:59.910
THOUSAND DOLLARS ON AVERAGE-

00:37:59.977 --> 00:38:01.312
THAT WOULD ADD TO THE COST TO

00:38:01.379 --> 00:38:02.947
SELL A HOME- IF THE HOME HAD

00:38:03.014 --> 00:38:04.949
DEAD TREES FOR EXAMPLE- THAT

00:38:05.016 --> 00:38:06.751
NUMBER COULD LIKELY INCREASED

00:38:06.817 --> 00:38:08.919
OVER TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS- THE

00:38:08.986 --> 00:38:10.855
AGAIN THESE COSTS- WOULD BE IF

00:38:10.921 --> 00:38:12.289
THE STATE WAS TO IMPOSE A FEE.

00:38:12.356 --> 00:38:13.958
AND FOR US TO PERFORM THE WORK

00:38:14.025 --> 00:38:15.493
AND THE COST REALLY JUST DON'T

00:38:15.559 --> 00:38:17.495

QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. I

00:38:22.633 --> 00:38:24.935
APPRECIATE THE BACKGROUND ON

THIS. AND WITH IT BEING LIMITED

00:38:27.838 --> 00:38:29.507
TO WHEN PROPERTIES ARE ARE

00:38:29.573 --> 00:38:30.741

THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT- DOWN

00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:39.350
THE ROAD WE WILL HAVE A-

00:38:39.417 --> 00:38:40.918
COMPLIANCE PROGRAM SIMPLY

00:38:40.985 --> 00:38:44.355
BECAUSE A FIRE RISK- AND TO.

GET SOME KIND OF ANNUAL

00:38:46.457 --> 00:38:49.226

WORK FOR ON HOMEOWNERS THAT

00:38:53.197 --> 00:38:54.331
THEY DON'T DO THE WORK AS I

00:38:54.398 --> 00:38:56.267
MENTIONED IT'S A COSTLY.

00:38:56.333 --> 00:38:58.235
VENTURE THAT WE REALLY DON'T DO

UNDERSTANDING IS THAT- WITHOUT

OF SOME FEDERAL GRANTS AND- AND

00:52:17.133 --> 00:52:19.402
HOW DOES THAT AFFECT OUR- A

EXAMPLE SOME OF THE FEDERAL

FUNDS THAT ARE IN THE PACKAGE

00:52:45.795 --> 00:52:47.364
IS THE HEAD OF BEFORE YOU.

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:48.732
THERE'S ONE POINT THREE BILLION

DOLLARS FOR DRINKING WATER

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:51.101
FUNDS AS PART OF THE WATER

00:52:51.167 --> 00:52:53.503
PACKAGE THERE'S ANOTHER BILLION

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:54.604
DOLLARS FOR THE WATER BOARD TO

00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:56.706
ADDRESS WATER REARRANGES. SO

00:52:56.773 --> 00:52:58.008
SOME OF THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE

00:52:58.074 --> 00:52:59.676
PRETTY PRESSING LIKE LIKE THE

00:52:59.743 --> 00:53:00.377
WATER DEBT THAT MIGHT BE

00:53:00.443 --> 00:53:01.611
SOMETHING YOU WANT TO THINK

00:53:01.678 --> 00:53:03.280
ABOUT MOVING ON MORE QUICKLY.

00:53:03.346 --> 00:53:05.515
BUT ACTIVITIES LIKE BIG WATER

00:53:05.582 --> 00:53:09.185
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT

00:53:09.252 --> 00:53:09.819
MAYBE YOU WANT TO TAKE A LITTLE

00:53:09.886 --> 00:53:11.154
BIT MORE TIME. ALL RIGHT THANK

00:53:11.221 --> 00:53:14.391
YOU AND- A SPEAKING OF- WATER-

00:53:14.457 --> 00:53:16.993
INFRASTRUCTURE- FOR THE

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:19.296
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE

00:53:19.362 --> 00:53:20.864
PROPOSAL INCLUDES ONE POINT

00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:22.966
THREE BILLION FOR DRINKING

00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:23.400
WATER AND WASTEWATER

00:53:23.466 --> 00:53:26.036
INFRASTRUCTURE. CAN YOU GIVE US

00:53:26.102 --> 00:53:28.038
SOME INDICATION OF HOW THIS. A

00:53:28.104 --> 00:53:29.573
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING.

00:53:29.639 --> 00:53:31.541
WOULD BE ALLOCATED BETWEEN THE

00:53:31.608 --> 00:53:33.743
TWO PROGRAMS- AND STAFF

00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:36.479
RESOURCES. YES SIR DRIVE OUR

00:53:36.546 --> 00:53:38.281
DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND JUST TO

00:53:38.348 --> 00:53:40.884
CLARIFY A LITTLE BIT ON ON THE-

00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:42.252
FEDERAL ARE BOTH FUNDING

00:53:42.319 --> 00:53:44.387
DEADLINE SO IT HAS TO BE

00:53:44.454 --> 00:53:47.157
ENCUMBERED. BY TWENTY TWENTY

00:53:47.223 --> 00:53:48.558
FOUR AND THEN TRULY YOU

00:53:48.625 --> 00:53:51.227
LIQUIDATED BY TWENTY TWENTY SIX

00:53:51.294 --> 00:53:51.962
SO IT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT

00:53:52.028 --> 00:53:52.929
OF THE OPPOSITE WHERE WE DON'T

00:53:52.996 --> 00:53:54.831
HAVE TIME ON THE FEDERAL FUNDS

00:53:54.898 --> 00:53:56.232
THAT'S THE ONE THAT WE ACTUALLY

00:53:56.299 --> 00:53:57.734
NEED TO GET THOSE PROJECTS OUT

00:53:57.801 --> 00:53:59.002
BECAUSE- HAVE MISSED A LETTER

00:53:59.069 --> 00:54:00.170
SAID YOU KNOW. THESE ARE LARGE

00:54:00.236 --> 00:54:01.037
PROJECT BECAUSE THEY TAKE A

00:54:01.104 --> 00:54:03.673
LONG TIME TO BUILD AND GET OUT

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:05.342
SO IF WE ACTUALLY DON'T USE

00:54:05.408 --> 00:54:07.110
THAT FUNDING WE LOSE IT IT GOES

00:54:07.177 --> 00:54:08.378
BACK TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:54:08.445 --> 00:54:10.780
SO THERE'S- THERE IS ACTUALLY.

00:54:10.847 --> 00:54:12.849
A SIGNIFICANT URGENCY TO

00:54:12.916 --> 00:54:14.217
PROCREATE APP FINDING TO BE

00:54:14.284 --> 00:54:15.819
ABLE TO HAVE A DEPARTMENTS

00:54:15.885 --> 00:54:17.253
STARTED GETTING THE PROJECT OUT

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.888
THE DOOR AND SPEND IT BECAUSE

00:54:18.955 --> 00:54:20.890
AGAIN IF YOU DON'T SPEND WE

00:54:20.957 --> 00:54:21.691
HAVE TO REVERT IT BACK TO THE

00:54:21.758 --> 00:54:23.660
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- SO JUST TO

00:54:23.727 --> 00:54:25.762
CLARIFY ON THAT POINT. AND THEN

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:27.631
SAT DOWN THE ONE POINT THREE

00:54:27.697 --> 00:54:28.965
POSSO IT BE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED

00:54:29.032 --> 00:54:30.467
MILLION DOLLARS THAT WOULD BE-

00:54:30.533 --> 00:54:32.636
WASTE WATER RELATED ABOUT ONE

00:54:32.702 --> 00:54:34.738
BILLION DOLLARS THAT THAT WOULD

00:54:34.804 --> 00:54:36.640
BE DRINKING WATER RELATED AND

00:54:36.706 --> 00:54:38.141
THEN I GENERALLY LIKE WE LIKE

00:54:38.208 --> 00:54:39.676
WE DO FOR BONDS YOU KNOW WE'RE

00:54:39.743 --> 00:54:41.444
AUTHORIZING ABOUT FIVE PERCENT.

00:54:41.511 --> 00:54:42.912
TO BE SPENT ON ADMINISTRATIVE

00:54:42.979 --> 00:54:44.814
COSTS AND SO- YOU KNOW A LOT OF

00:54:44.881 --> 00:54:47.017
THESE PROGRAMS ARE OUR PROGRAM

00:54:47.083 --> 00:54:48.952
THAT WE HAVE- FUNDED INVOLVED

00:54:49.019 --> 00:54:50.987
BEFORE AND WE'RE STRUCTURING

00:54:51.054 --> 00:54:53.423
THE- KIND OF THE PROGRAM'S VERY

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:55.558
SIMILARLY- AND SO I JUST KIND

00:54:55.625 --> 00:54:57.327
OF KNOW THAT SO IT'S CONSISTENT

00:54:57.394 --> 00:55:01.931
WITH HOW WE'VE- IMPLEMENTED

00:55:01.998 --> 00:55:03.299
THESE PROGRAMS BEFORE. THERE'S

00:55:03.366 --> 00:55:05.835
A TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS.

00:55:05.902 --> 00:55:07.737
ALLOCATED FOR A P. FAST CLEAN

00:55:07.804 --> 00:55:12.308
UP. AND I GUESS MY QUESTION IS

00:55:12.375 --> 00:55:15.578
OF THE- OF THE- PROBLEM IS MUCH

00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:17.180
LARGER THAN A TWENTY MILLION

00:55:17.247 --> 00:55:18.948
DOLLARS SO WHY IS THE AMOUNT

00:55:19.015 --> 00:55:25.822
SOLO. YES ALSO- AND YOU KNOW AS

00:55:25.889 --> 00:55:27.457
WATER WORK ACT ALSO ON THE LINE

00:55:27.524 --> 00:55:29.626
TO. PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION

00:55:29.693 --> 00:55:31.061
BUT THERE'S A KIND OF A NEW YOU

00:55:31.127 --> 00:55:33.329
KNOW EMERGING- KIND OF CHEMICAL

00:55:33.396 --> 00:55:34.431
THAT IT'S STILL BEING ANALYZED

00:55:34.497 --> 00:55:36.132
AND SO I UNITED WE THINK THAT

01:02:18.534 --> 01:02:19.802
ENTITIES WITHIN OUR AGENCY IN

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:21.604
ACROSS THE GOVERNMENT WHERE-

01:02:21.671 --> 01:02:24.173

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:39.122
AGENCY AND AS YOU POINT OUT

01:02:39.188 --> 01:02:41.057
THOSE. THOSE OP ADDITIONS THE

01:02:41.124 --> 01:02:43.659

HOW DO WE SPEND THIS ONE TIME

01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:48.798
FUNDING. I IN A WAY THAT

01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:50.700

01:03:14.824 --> 01:03:16.125
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ONE TIME

01:03:16.192 --> 01:03:17.693
FUNDING AND THE ON GOING

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:20.096
CHALLENGES- THAT WE HAVE IN

01:03:20.163 --> 01:03:22.431
TERMS OF THAT FUNDING I THINK

01:03:22.498 --> 01:03:24.800
GIVEN THE CRISIS AND EVERYTHING

01:03:24.867 --> 01:03:26.769
THAT WE HAVE OUT THERE. MY

01:03:26.836 --> 01:03:28.437
EXPERIENCE COMING FROM LOCAL

01:03:28.504 --> 01:03:29.739
GOVERNMENT IS AT THE COAST

01:03:29.805 --> 01:03:31.340
COMMISSION SEEMS TO BE SORT OF

01:03:31.407 --> 01:03:33.209
AT THE APEX OF ALL OF THESE

01:03:33.276 --> 01:03:34.477
DIFFERENT AGENCIES EVERYTHING

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:35.878
COMES BACK TO WELL THEN WE HAVE

01:03:35.945 --> 01:03:36.412
TO SEE WHAT THE CAUSE OF

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:38.181
COMMISSION SAYSENOUGH THAT. IN

01:03:38.247 --> 01:03:41.017
AND SO AS YOU SAID THEY PLAY

01:03:41.083 --> 01:03:43.553
REALLY PIVOTAL ROLE FOR ALL OF

01:03:43.619 --> 01:03:45.454
THESE AGENCIES ULTIMATELY-

01:03:45.521 --> 01:03:47.957
COMING TOGETHER SO IF THERE WAS

01:03:48.024 --> 01:03:50.059
A WAY TO TAKE SOME ONE TIME

01:03:50.126 --> 01:03:51.427
MONEY AND STRETCH IT OVER A

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:54.297
NUMBER OF YEARS YOU KNOW- FIVE

01:03:54.363 --> 01:03:55.565
MILLION DOLLARS STRETCHED OVER

01:03:55.631 --> 01:03:57.066
A NUMBER OF YEARS TO HELP WITH

01:03:57.133 --> 01:03:59.669
ALL OF THIS. FAST MOVING

01:03:59.735 --> 01:04:01.604
IMPLEMENTATION EXCITER IT

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:04.740
STRIKES ME AS A AS I I'M JUST

01:04:04.807 --> 01:04:06.309
THROWING OUT AN EXAMPLE OF THE

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:07.677
NEED TO DISTRACT ME AS A AS A

01:04:07.743 --> 01:04:09.278
REASONABLE EXAMPLE GIVEN THAT

01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:10.413
YOU KNOW SOME OTHER AGENCIES

01:04:10.479 --> 01:04:12.381
ARE RIVAS RECEIVING SIGNIFICANT

01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:13.749
FUNDING INCREASES. AND I DON'T

01:04:13.816 --> 01:04:15.218
HAVE THAT MUCH INTERACTION WITH

01:04:15.284 --> 01:04:16.652
BECAUSE I JUST SEE THAT

01:04:16.719 --> 01:04:18.521
HAPPENING OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:19.956
THE OTHER THING I WOULD POINT

01:04:20.022 --> 01:04:20.856
OUT IS COMING FROM LOCAL

01:04:20.923 --> 01:04:23.125
GOVERNMENT- CONSISTENTLY PEOPLE

01:04:23.192 --> 01:04:25.261
WOULD HAVE TO BE TO WORK WOULD

01:04:25.328 --> 01:04:26.562
BE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW MUCH

01:04:26.629 --> 01:04:27.863
TIME WOULD IT WOULD THEY HAVE

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:30.733
TO WAIT FOR STAFF TO ANALYZE-

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:33.202
PROJECTS AND- YOU KNOWHOW MUCH

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:34.670
ABILITY TO CAUSE COMMISSION

01:04:34.737 --> 01:04:35.905
STAFF HAVE HAVE IME TO DO

01:04:35.972 --> 01:04:37.640
THAT. SO WITH THAT THANK YOU

01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:39.709
VERY MUCH FOR THAT RESPONSE AT

01:04:39.775 --> 01:04:40.509
AND IF ANYBODY ELSE HAS A

01:04:40.576 --> 01:04:42.011
RESPONSE ON THAT I'M GOING TO

01:04:42.078 --> 01:04:43.779
JUMP TO SOME OTHER TOPICS BUT-

01:04:43.846 --> 01:04:45.081
IF SOMEBODY WANTS IF WE WANT TO

01:04:45.147 --> 01:04:47.083
STAY ON COSTA COMMISSION. IF

01:04:47.149 --> 01:04:48.651
ANYBODY HAS ANYTHING ELSE ON

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:49.619

THEIR- ALL JUST ADDED A QUICK

01:04:52.288 --> 01:04:54.290
COMMENT- IF YOU DON'T MIND IS A

01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:56.892
FORMER COASTAL COMMISSIONER-

01:04:56.959 --> 01:04:59.128
THE COASTAL COMMISSION- IS

01:04:59.195 --> 01:05:00.730
INTEGRAL TO ALL THESE EFFORTS

01:05:00.796 --> 01:05:03.499
AROUND TO C. LEVEL RISE. AND I

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:06.902
JOIN YOU- DIRECTOR CRAWFORD AND-

01:05:06.969 --> 01:05:08.671

ELEVEN MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL

01:05:10.706 --> 01:05:13.776
HERE I THINK IT'S GREAT- BUT I

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:15.344
DO THINK WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE

01:05:15.411 --> 01:05:17.613
THAT- OVER THE YEARS THE

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:20.349
COASTAL COMMISSION HAS BEEN- A

01:05:20.416 --> 01:05:24.053
YEAR AFTER YEAR- HAD TO KIND OF

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:28.557
BEG FOR CRUMBS- WHEN IT COMES

01:05:28.624 --> 01:05:29.892
TO- TO. FUNDING SO WHEN YOU ADD

01:05:29.959 --> 01:05:33.996
THAT THE 5% EFFICIENCY- A

01:05:34.063 --> 01:05:37.700
CIRCUMSTANCE- THAT PUTS IT

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.402
ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON THEM TO

01:05:39.468 --> 01:05:40.670
DO THE JOB THAT THEY ARE

01:05:40.736 --> 01:05:42.405
CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED TO

01:05:42.471 --> 01:05:45.875
DO- WITH ESSENTIALLY LESS AND

01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:46.642
LESS AND FEWER AND FEWER

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:50.012
RESOURCES- AND THEN ADD TO THAT

01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:50.980
THESE ADDITIONAL

01:05:51.047 --> 01:05:52.581
RESPONSIBILITIES THAT ARE

01:05:52.648 --> 01:05:53.816
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I THINK WE

01:05:53.883 --> 01:05:58.587
ALL AGREE- AND- IT'S HARD TO

01:05:58.654 --> 01:05:59.221
IMAGINE HOW THEY CAN ACTUALLY

01:05:59.288 --> 01:06:01.390
GET THE WORK DONE AND WE KNOW

01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:03.092
THAT WE WANT EVERYBODY TO BE

01:06:03.159 --> 01:06:03.993

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS- FOR YOU-

01:06:09.565 --> 01:06:11.434
AND YOU HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.502
POINTS OKAY AND THEN WE HAVE-

01:06:13.569 --> 01:06:15.104
IS RIVAS WAITING. AND IT HERE

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:15.938
FOR COMMENTS ON KANNST

01:06:16.005 --> 01:06:17.773
COMMISSION AND SHE PREFERS TO

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.475
GO NOW THAT'S FINE BUT- I THINK

01:06:19.542 --> 01:06:20.876
SHE'S ON TOP OF ANOTHER TOPIC

01:06:20.943 --> 01:06:23.479
GREAT- IF IS THERE MORE DETAIL

01:06:23.546 --> 01:06:25.514
ON THE BIOMASS TO HYDROGEN AND

01:06:25.581 --> 01:06:29.585
BIOFUELS- PILOT- I'M AT I WOULD

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:31.187
LIKE TO MAKE SURE S. AS WE'RE

01:06:31.253 --> 01:06:32.855
TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD. AT THAT

01:06:32.922 --> 01:06:34.457
MOMENT I'LL TALK ABOUT HYDROGEN

01:06:34.523 --> 01:06:37.793
AND IN INTO CONCEPTS- AND THE

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:39.962
THAT IS WHEN IT COMES TO.

01:06:40.029 --> 01:06:43.099
CHARGING STATIONS AND- THEN WE

01:06:43.165 --> 01:06:46.302
HAVE THESE OTHER HYDROGEN THAT-

01:06:46.369 --> 01:06:48.237
YOU KNOW PILOT PROGRAM PROGRAMS

01:06:48.304 --> 01:06:49.305
OUT THERE ARE BIOMASS TO

01:06:49.372 --> 01:06:50.706
HYDROGEN JUST IN TERMS OF

01:06:50.773 --> 01:06:52.408
CREATING IT. SEEMS TO BE THE

01:06:52.475 --> 01:06:55.745
RIGHT NOW WE ARE. INVESTING

01:06:55.811 --> 01:06:57.246
SIGNIFICANT FUNDS INTO THE

01:06:57.313 --> 01:06:59.014
EEVEE CHARGING STATIONS WHICH I

01:06:59.081 --> 01:07:02.284
COMPLETELY SUPPORT- MY BELIEF

01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:04.987
IS FOR. THE BEST THING FOR US

01:07:05.054 --> 01:07:06.455
TO DO IN CALIFORNIA IS TO DO

01:07:06.522 --> 01:07:07.590
THE SAME THING THAT THEY'RE

01:07:07.656 --> 01:07:08.758
DOING IN EUROPE WHICH IS TRYING

01:07:08.824 --> 01:07:11.327
TO. HAVE THE RESILIENCY OF BOTH

01:07:11.394 --> 01:07:14.897
HYDROGEN AND ELECTRICITY- AS

01:07:14.964 --> 01:07:16.065
THE OPTIONS FOR US TO MOVE

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:17.299
FORWARD IN TERMS OF CLIMATE

01:07:17.366 --> 01:07:21.237
CHANGE- IT SEEMS LIKE WE ARE-

01:07:21.303 --> 01:07:23.205
WE NEED TO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:07:23.272 --> 01:07:25.408
THAT WE HAVE THAT THAT HYGIENE

01:07:25.474 --> 01:07:27.777
MOVING FORWARD ALSO. A NUMBER

01:07:27.843 --> 01:07:29.578
OF PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

01:07:29.645 --> 01:07:32.047
THE HYDROGEN NOT BEING A 100%

01:07:32.114 --> 01:07:33.816
CLEAN YET. AND I WOULD POINT

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:35.251
OUT THAT THE ELECTRICITY WERE

01:07:35.317 --> 01:07:36.852
USING FOR ELECTRICITY CHARGING

01:07:36.919 --> 01:07:38.988
STATIONS IS ALSO NOT A 100%

01:07:39.054 --> 01:07:41.924
CLEAN YET- SO I WOULD SUPPORT

01:07:41.991 --> 01:07:43.392
POLICIES THAT WOULD SAY THEY

01:07:43.459 --> 01:07:44.326
BOTH NEED TO BE A HUNDRED

01:07:44.393 --> 01:07:47.129
PERCENT. RENEWABLE SOURCES OF

01:07:47.196 --> 01:07:51.500
ENERGY. AT WHEN THE TIME COMES.

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:52.902
WHEN THAT IS SHOULD BE ON THE

01:07:52.968 --> 01:07:54.069
SAME SCHEDULE IN TERMS OF

01:07:54.136 --> 01:07:56.839
NEEDING TO BE THERE- BUT FOR US

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:58.974
TO HOLD BACK ON GETTING THE

01:07:59.041 --> 01:08:00.443
INFRASTRUCTURE GOING FOR

01:08:00.509 --> 01:08:04.547
HYDROGEN- DOESN'T- DOESN'T MAKE

01:08:04.613 --> 01:08:06.182
SENSE IF WE SAY HEY WE WANT TO

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:07.116
THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THERE'S

01:08:07.183 --> 01:08:08.417
NOT SUPPORT FOR THE INSTRUCTION

01:08:08.484 --> 01:08:09.819
TELL HAD REGION IS A 100%

01:08:09.885 --> 01:08:11.320
CLEAN. BECAUSE IF THAT WAS THE

01:08:11.387 --> 01:08:13.255
CASE WE WOULD BE DOING E. V.

01:08:13.322 --> 01:08:15.558
THAT STRUCTURE ALSO. SO WITH

01:08:15.624 --> 01:08:18.761
THAT BEING SAID- HE YOU KNOW IT

01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:22.198
HI I AM I WOULD LIKE TO- SEE IF

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:23.299
WE CAN COME UP WITH SOME

01:08:23.365 --> 01:08:26.101
POLICIES THAT. SUPPORT BOTH PUT

01:08:26.168 --> 01:08:28.904
THEM BOTH ON THE SAME KIND OF

01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:32.141
TIME FRAME- IN TERMS OF WHEN

01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:33.609
THEY HAVE TO GET TO A 100%

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:35.211
GREEN BUT NOT DISADVANTAGE ONE

01:08:35.277 --> 01:08:36.779
OVER THE OTHER- WHILE THEY'RE

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:39.248
WAITING TO GET THEIR- BECAUSE

01:08:39.315 --> 01:08:41.750
WE- CERTAINLY WITH TRUCKS. AND

01:08:41.817 --> 01:08:44.553
BUSES HYDROGEN. I THINK

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:47.323
EVERYBODY AGREES IS A IS A GOOD

01:08:47.389 --> 01:08:49.692
SOLUTION- IT SEEMS TO ME WE

01:08:49.758 --> 01:08:51.393
SHOULDN'T IGNORE THE FACT THAT

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:52.661
FOR PASSENGER VEHICLES IT'S

01:08:52.728 --> 01:08:55.731
ALSO STILL. A VIABLE OPTION-

01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:56.966
PARTICULARLY WITH THE LOWER

01:08:57.032 --> 01:08:58.400
LIFE CYCLE COST

01:08:58.467 --> 01:09:00.336
EXTRATERRESTRIAL AGAIN I'M NOT

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:01.704
TRYING TO ADVANTAGE ONE OVER

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:02.705
THE OTHERS WILL TRY TO MAKE

01:09:02.771 --> 01:09:05.174
SURE WE STAY RESILIENT OF BOTH

01:09:05.241 --> 01:09:07.109
OF THOSE SO- THE ON THE BIOMASS

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:08.711
ARE THERE ANY MORE DETAILS ON

01:09:08.777 --> 01:09:10.412
THE- BIOMASS TO HYDROGEN

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:16.151
BIOFUELS PILOT- AND- IS THERE

01:09:16.218 --> 01:09:18.621
AN EFFORT TO ENSURE- THAT WERE

01:09:18.687 --> 01:09:20.923
COMING UP WITH A GAME PLAN FOR-

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:22.625
BOTH. THE ENERGY SOURCE IS

01:09:22.691 --> 01:09:25.194
BEING- CLEAN AT THE SAME TIME

01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:26.929
AND BOTH OF THEM GETTING-

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:28.864
ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF THE

01:09:28.931 --> 01:09:30.799
INFRASTRUCTURE CHARGING

01:09:30.866 --> 01:09:31.367
STATIONS GOING FORWARD THANK

01:09:31.433 --> 01:09:35.504
YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AGAIN

01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:36.805
WAIT CRAWFORD I'LL TURN IT OVER

01:09:36.872 --> 01:09:37.840
IN A MOMENT OF TO ONE OF MY

01:09:37.907 --> 01:09:38.774
COLLEAGUES WHO CAN ANSWER

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.743
SPECIFIC ON THAT I'M THE

01:09:40.809 --> 01:09:42.778
PROPOSED PROJECT ALLOCATION BUT

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:44.480
I'LL JUST. THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:09:44.547 --> 01:09:46.415
INSIGHTS ON ON HYDROGEN WE

01:09:46.482 --> 01:09:49.118
RECOGNIZE HYDROGEN'S IMPORTANCE

01:09:49.184 --> 01:09:51.053
FOR CALIFORNIA IN REACHING OUR

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.155
CARBON NEUTRALITY GOAL- THERE

01:09:53.222 --> 01:09:54.557
WILL BE APPLICATIONS IN

01:09:54.623 --> 01:09:55.891
CALIFORNIA ARE THAT WILL

01:09:55.958 --> 01:09:57.459
CONTINUE TO REQUIRE LIQUID

01:09:57.526 --> 01:10:00.296
FUELS SO THINK SHIPS AND PLANES

01:10:00.362 --> 01:10:02.364
AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS SEES.

01:10:02.431 --> 01:10:04.733
AND CLEAN HYDROGEN IS OBVIOUSLY

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.503
CRITICAL TO. MAINTAINING

01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:08.704
ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THOSE

01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:10.372
SECTORS WHILE ACHIEVING CARBON

01:10:10.439 --> 01:10:11.640
NEUTRALITY SO REALLY APPRECIATE

01:10:11.707 --> 01:10:13.275
YOUR INSIGHTS I'M GONNA TURN

01:10:13.342 --> 01:10:14.710
INTO A COLLIE THAT CAN MORE

QUESTION ON THAT ARE PROPOSED

01:10:18.514 --> 01:10:28.324
ALLOCATION. HI GOOD MORNING

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:30.492
THIS IS CANON RITUAL- DEPUTY

01:10:30.559 --> 01:10:31.694
DIRECTOR OF THE FILM

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.028
TRANSPORTATION DIVISION OKAY.

01:10:33.095 --> 01:10:38.233
YES OKAY GREAT YEAH SO OF THE

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:40.369
THAT PACKAGE ON THE HYDROGEN

01:10:40.436 --> 01:10:42.504
SIDE WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED

01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:45.240
MILLION AND- A GENERAL PUSH TO

01:10:45.307 --> 01:10:45.708
CLOSE THE LIGHT DUTY

01:10:45.774 --> 01:10:47.610
INFRASTRUCTURE GAP OF THAT WILL

01:10:47.676 --> 01:10:49.378
BE ABOUT THE IN BOTH ELECTRIC

01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:51.080
AND HYDROGEN TO CLOSE THAT GAP

01:10:51.146 --> 01:10:52.581
OF THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION

01:10:52.648 --> 01:10:54.416
ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO

01:10:54.483 --> 01:10:55.217
MEDIUM DUTY HEAVY DUTY

01:10:55.284 --> 01:10:57.820
VEHICLES- BOTH ELECTRIC AND

01:10:57.886 --> 01:10:58.854
HYDROGEN ARE VERY MUCH ELIGIBLE

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:00.589
FOR THAT IT'S OFFER CONSUMER

01:11:00.656 --> 01:11:02.958
DRIVEN SO WE CAN REALLY GET

01:11:03.025 --> 01:11:03.759
HUNDRED UPTAKE BY TRANSIT

01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:06.061
AGENCIES AS WELL AS ELECTRIC-

01:11:06.128 --> 01:11:08.263
ELECTRIC BOX UPTAKE BY TRANSIT

01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:11.166
AGENCIES. SIMILARLY ON THAT

01:11:11.233 --> 01:11:12.601
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION

01:11:12.668 --> 01:11:13.469
BAHT TARGETED HEAVY DUTY

01:11:13.535 --> 01:11:16.305
VEHICLES- GREAT TRUCK TRANSIT

01:11:16.372 --> 01:11:18.207
AND SCHOOL BOTH ELECTRIC AND

01:11:18.273 --> 01:11:19.541
HYDROGEN ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT

01:11:19.608 --> 01:11:22.878
AS WELL BONTA YET WE SHARE YOUR

01:11:22.945 --> 01:11:23.979
SENTIMENT THAT WE NEED TO SET

01:11:24.046 --> 01:11:25.781
THE FOR BOTH ELECTRIC AND

01:11:25.848 --> 01:11:28.250
HYDROGEN I WILL NOTE THAT OF

01:11:28.317 --> 01:11:29.118
OUR PROPERTY ONE HUNDRED

01:11:29.184 --> 01:11:30.619
MILLION PER YEAR IN THE

01:11:30.686 --> 01:11:32.421
CONTRACT PROTECTION PROGRAM

01:11:32.488 --> 01:11:34.690
WE'VE INVESTED TWENTY MILLION

01:11:34.757 --> 01:11:36.592
PER YEAR JUST ON THE PUBLIC

01:11:36.659 --> 01:11:38.527
HYDROGEN OXIDE AND I THINK

01:11:38.594 --> 01:11:39.795
WE'RE NOT GO TO THAT EVEN ON

01:11:39.862 --> 01:11:40.529
THE MEDIUM DUTY HOW DID YOU

01:11:40.596 --> 01:11:42.731
DECIDE. TO ABOUT ONE THIRD OF

01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:43.565
THOSE INVESTMENTS HAVE GONE TO

01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:46.502
HYDROGEN- ALREADY AND WE SEE-

01:11:46.568 --> 01:11:52.241
LARGE INVESTMENTS. HAVE BEEN

01:11:52.307 --> 01:11:52.841
GOING FORWARD AS WELL. D. DO

01:11:52.908 --> 01:11:54.243
YOU KNOW THE DOWN INTO OF THE

01:11:54.309 --> 01:11:55.177
IN TERMS OF PASS REAR SIDE

01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:56.945
WHERE WE ARE WITH HYDROGEN

01:11:57.012 --> 01:11:58.313
CHARGING STATIONS VERSUS

01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:01.083
ELECTRIC CHARGING STATIONS.

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:03.318
YEAH SO WE HAVE ABOUT SEVENTY

01:12:03.385 --> 01:12:04.553
THOUSAND ELECTRIC ISSUES OUT

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:06.622
THERE RIGHT NOW AND ABOUT FORTY

01:12:06.689 --> 01:12:09.091
NINE HYDROGEN STATIONS. AND SO-

01:12:09.158 --> 01:12:10.726
ON THE ELECTRIC SIDE WE ARE

01:12:10.793 --> 01:12:14.363
LAGGING- MORE SO AND SO- THAT'S

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:15.731
WHY YOU FEEL GREATER INVESTMENT

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:18.600
ELECTRIFIED WE APPROACH IT FROM

01:12:18.667 --> 01:12:20.469
A VERY DATA DRIVEN- PLACE. AND

01:12:20.536 --> 01:12:23.072
TO LOOK AT THEY GOT FOR TWENTY

01:12:23.138 --> 01:12:23.672
TWENTY FIVE THE LARGER GAP ON

01:12:23.739 --> 01:12:25.240
THE ELECTRIFIED. ON THE HUNDRED

01:12:25.307 --> 01:12:28.310
INSIDE- THERE'S ABOUT SEVENTY

01:12:28.377 --> 01:12:29.044
EIGHT THOUSAND FUEL CELL

01:12:29.111 --> 01:12:30.012
ELECTRIC VEHICLES ON THE ROAD

01:12:30.079 --> 01:12:33.048
TODAY. AND WERE EXPECTED TO

01:12:33.115 --> 01:12:34.817
REACH A HUNDRED AND FIVE

01:12:34.883 --> 01:12:35.984
HUNDRED STATEMENT BY TWENTY

01:12:36.051 --> 01:12:37.419
TWENTY THREE. AT THAT POINT

01:12:37.486 --> 01:12:40.622
WE'LL HAVE PEELING CAPACITY

01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:41.190
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

01:12:41.256 --> 01:12:42.491
BLIGHTED HYDROGEN VEHICLES. AND

01:12:42.558 --> 01:12:43.559
SO WHEN WE LOOK AT IT WE

01:12:43.625 --> 01:12:45.260
LOOKED- ON THE DATA ANALYTICS

01:12:45.327 --> 01:12:46.929
IN THE LIGHT HE FIRED TO MAKE

01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:48.764
SURE WE'RE SUPPORTING BOTH. BUT

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:49.765
ALSO LOOKING AT WHAT CONSUMERS

01:12:49.832 --> 01:12:51.700
ARE ADOPTING AND I SIMILARLY ON

01:12:51.767 --> 01:12:53.635
THE MEDIA YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WE

01:12:53.702 --> 01:12:55.170
LOOK AT WHAT IT DOES DIFFERENT

01:12:55.237 --> 01:12:57.106
FLEETS THE CONTRACT ABOUT THE-

01:12:57.172 --> 01:12:58.440
DRAINAGE IN THE BY NATURE OF

01:12:58.507 --> 01:12:59.975
WHAT THEY'RE PREPARING. AND

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:02.277
WHERE WE CAN SUPPORT THE THERE-

01:13:02.344 --> 01:13:03.245
AGAIN PHOTOELECTRIC AND HUNDRED

01:13:03.312 --> 01:13:09.251
AND- TO GET TO THEIR MISSION

01:13:09.318 --> 01:13:10.085
PETER. HE IF I COULD THAT I

01:13:10.152 --> 01:13:11.620
HAVE. THE DALLAS BAY ON. THE

01:13:11.687 --> 01:13:13.055
NUMBER OF VEHICLES BEING

01:13:13.122 --> 01:13:15.023
PURCHASED AND YOU KNOW WHERE WE

01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:16.258
ARE SHORT QUITE FRANKLY WERE

01:13:16.325 --> 01:13:17.793
BEAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:20.596
GET THERE WITH. BUT YOU KNOW.

01:13:20.662 --> 01:13:22.931
WHAT'S BOTTOM BUT THE- IF OUR

01:13:22.998 --> 01:13:25.300
GOAL IS TO HAVE THE RESILIENCY

01:13:25.367 --> 01:13:28.203
OF TWO DIFFERENT ENERGY SOURCES

01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:29.171
THAT COULD HELP GET US TO

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:31.940
CLEAN- WE HAVE A CHICKEN AND

01:13:32.007 --> 01:13:33.175
EGG PROBLEM AND THAT IF WE

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:34.409
DON'T HAVE THE HYDROGEN

01:13:34.476 --> 01:13:36.478
CHARGING STATIONS PARTICULARLY-

01:13:36.545 --> 01:13:37.846
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ARE FIRST

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:39.782
STARTING OUT IF I MEAN IF

01:13:39.848 --> 01:13:41.550
THEY'RE JUST VERY VERY FEW. A

01:13:41.617 --> 01:13:42.851
DIFFICULT TO GET THE PASSENGER

01:13:42.918 --> 01:13:46.155
VEHICLE SALES. TO GO UP- IT

01:13:46.221 --> 01:13:49.758
SEEMS THAT- IF WERE FORWARD

01:13:49.825 --> 01:13:51.460
THINKING WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:13:51.527 --> 01:13:53.428
WE HAVE AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT SO

01:13:53.495 --> 01:13:54.630
THAT WE CAN THEN FIND OUT

01:13:54.696 --> 01:13:56.198
WHETHER THE CONSUMERS REALLY

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:57.366
ARE WILLING TO EMBRACE THAT

01:13:57.432 --> 01:14:00.803
TECHNOLOGY. I DON'T KNOW AND-

01:14:00.869 --> 01:14:02.204
SO I AND I'M NOT SURE I WOULD

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:03.539
ENCOURAGE US TO ONLY USE THE

01:14:03.605 --> 01:14:05.240
ANALYSIS OF CURRENT NUMBER OF

01:14:05.307 --> 01:14:06.809
SALES BECAUSE YOU WON'T GET THE

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:08.210
SALES UNTIL YOU CAN. TELL YOU

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:10.412
HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE OUT

01:14:10.479 --> 01:14:11.747
THERE THAT WOULD MAKE SOMEBODY

01:14:11.814 --> 01:14:12.848
FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THAT SO I

01:14:12.915 --> 01:14:14.883
HOPE WE WOULD CONSIDER THAT AS

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:15.551
WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT THAT

01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:19.721
MIX- AND YEAH YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:21.390
RIGHT. ABOUT THAT. WE MADE OUR

01:14:21.456 --> 01:14:23.725
GOAL I THINK JUST WE WILL BE

01:14:23.792 --> 01:14:25.160
BETTER OFF JUST JUST IT AND

01:14:25.227 --> 01:14:26.028
THEY'RE DOING THE SAME THING IN

01:14:26.094 --> 01:14:26.728
EUROPE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO

01:14:26.795 --> 01:14:27.930
MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE BOTH

01:14:27.996 --> 01:14:30.766
OF THOSE- SOURCES- ALTAIR

01:14:30.833 --> 01:14:32.334
BEFORE BECAUSE OF THE-

01:14:32.401 --> 01:14:34.269
REDUNDANCY FACTOR. WHO WHO

01:14:34.336 --> 01:14:35.370
KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

01:14:35.437 --> 01:14:36.271
WITH EITHER ONE OF THOSE

01:14:36.338 --> 01:14:37.306
SOURCES IN TERMS OF.

01:14:37.372 --> 01:14:39.208
TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES SIX

01:14:39.274 --> 01:14:40.375
CENTER THAT THAT THAT MAY COME

01:14:40.442 --> 01:14:43.545
FORWARD- AND LIFECYCLE COST AND

01:14:43.612 --> 01:14:45.714
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. FINALLY

01:14:45.781 --> 01:14:47.850
I JUST A- WORD IT TURNED OVER

01:14:47.916 --> 01:14:50.285
TO MY COLLEAGUE- I JUST WANT

01:14:50.352 --> 01:14:52.788
TO. LET THE- THE STAFF IN

01:14:52.855 --> 01:14:53.589
PARTICULAR AND THE

01:14:53.655 --> 01:14:54.923
ADMINISTRATION- I APPRECIATE

01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:56.291
THE TYING OF THE CAP ON THE

01:14:56.358 --> 01:14:58.427
FEES ON ELECTRIC BILLS. TO THE

01:14:58.493 --> 01:15:00.395
CONSUMER PRICE INDEX- THAT'S

01:15:00.462 --> 01:15:01.663
SOMETHING THAT WE BROUGHT UP

01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:05.400
HERE- IN THIS- COMMITTEE- ROOM-

01:15:05.467 --> 01:15:08.070
IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS- THAT IT'S

01:15:08.136 --> 01:15:10.572
BETTER FOR CALIFORNIA TO HAVE

01:15:10.639 --> 01:15:13.375
FEES TIED. TO INFLATIONARY

01:15:13.442 --> 01:15:15.143
INCREASES AND- YOU'VE DONE THAT

01:15:15.210 --> 01:15:16.211
HERE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE

01:15:16.278 --> 01:15:20.282
THAT- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:21.283
MISTER MULLIN DID YOU HAVE A

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:22.818
FOLLOW UP QUESTION OR A

01:15:22.885 --> 01:15:24.987
SEPARATE QUESTION. ALRIGHT THEN

01:15:25.053 --> 01:15:26.655
WE'LL HAVE FIVE MINUTES READ

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:30.592
THIS AND THEN YOU MISTER MOLOT.

01:15:30.659 --> 01:15:35.230
I AM VERY HAPPY THE INVESTMENT.

01:15:35.297 --> 01:15:37.966
ALL INVESTMENTS AND THE FOCUS

01:15:38.033 --> 01:15:39.601
ON EXTREME HEAT AND THIS MAY

01:15:39.668 --> 01:15:42.504
BUDGET REVISED- IT'S CLEAR THAT

01:15:42.571 --> 01:15:44.907
EXTREME HEAT IS HERE NOW AND

01:15:44.973 --> 01:15:47.242
I'M HAPPY THAT ADMINISTRATION-

01:15:47.309 --> 01:15:48.744
IS SUPPORTING COMMUNITIES THAT

01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:51.046
ARE VULNERABLE TO THIS WEATHER

01:15:51.113 --> 01:15:54.049
EVENT- BUT WHILE THE FUNDING

01:15:54.116 --> 01:15:57.886
DIRECTED TO THE CVC TO CREATE A

01:15:57.953 --> 01:16:00.289
PROGRAM OUT OF THE BILL PROGRAM

01:16:00.355 --> 01:16:02.190
IS A GOOD STEP. I'M CONCERNED

01:16:02.257 --> 01:16:03.725
THAT THAT WHOLE THING CLIMATE

01:16:03.792 --> 01:16:06.895
IMPACTS OF WILL NOT BE AS

01:16:06.962 --> 01:16:09.798
PRIORITIZED- YOU KNOW THE CC IS

01:16:09.865 --> 01:16:11.867
FOCUSED ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY

01:16:11.934 --> 01:16:13.168
AND THEY'RE VERY GOOD AT

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:14.937
DIRECTING FUNDING FOR ENERGY

01:16:15.003 --> 01:16:17.172
EFFICIENCY BUT EXTREME HATE IS

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:18.040
PERVASIVE IN HARMING

01:16:18.106 --> 01:16:20.008
COMMUNITIES LIKE THOSE IN MY

01:16:20.075 --> 01:16:22.210
DISTRICT. YOU KNOW THIS FUNDING

01:16:22.277 --> 01:16:24.046
IS LIMITED SOLELY TO

01:16:24.112 --> 01:16:25.814
RESIDENTIAL UNITS TO REALLY

01:16:25.881 --> 01:16:28.817
DRAW DOWN AMBIENT TEMPERATURES-

01:16:28.884 --> 01:16:30.585
WELL I THINK TO REALLY DRAW

01:16:30.652 --> 01:16:32.788
DOWN AMBIENT TEMPERATURES IN IN

01:16:32.854 --> 01:16:34.389
AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY I THINK WE

01:16:34.456 --> 01:16:35.557
NEED TO GIVE LOCAL

01:16:35.624 --> 01:16:38.627
JURISDICTIONS THE ABILITY TO

01:16:38.694 --> 01:16:40.796
DETERMINE WHICH PROJECTS DO

01:16:40.862 --> 01:16:43.231
THAT IN ACHIEVE THAT GOAL- AND

01:16:43.298 --> 01:16:46.001
POTENTIALLY WORK WITH NGOS THAT

01:16:46.068 --> 01:16:47.302
ARE ON THE GROUND AND THEY CAN

01:16:47.369 --> 01:16:50.639
HELP IDENTIFY THOSE AREAS- SO

01:16:50.706 --> 01:16:52.607
THAT'S WHY I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE

01:16:52.674 --> 01:16:54.409
CAN COMPLEMENT THE HUNDRED

01:16:54.476 --> 01:16:57.412
MILLION DOLLARS AT THE C. E. C.

01:16:57.479 --> 01:17:00.182
AND CAN ALLOW OPR. TO WORK WITH

01:17:00.248 --> 01:17:01.883
THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL TO

01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:04.019
DETERMINE THE GRANT PROCESS FOR

01:17:04.086 --> 01:17:06.355
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UP TO TAP

01:17:06.421 --> 01:17:09.091
INTO RESOURCES AND TO EMPOWER

01:17:09.157 --> 01:17:11.093
THEM TO IMPLEMENT THE EXTREME

01:17:11.159 --> 01:17:15.030
HEAT MEASURES THAT ARE BEST FOR

01:17:15.097 --> 01:17:18.333
THEM. THANK YOU. FOR THANK YOU

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:22.137
MR MOHAN. I THANK YOU MR

01:17:22.204 --> 01:17:23.472
CHAIRMAN NOT SURE IF MISTER

01:17:23.538 --> 01:17:25.107
SECRETARY IS STILL WITH US BUT

01:17:25.173 --> 01:17:27.576
IT WAS GOOD TO SEE HIM- I THINK

01:17:27.642 --> 01:17:30.012
THE- OPPORTUNITY EXISTS REALLY

01:17:30.078 --> 01:17:31.747
AN EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITY

01:17:31.813 --> 01:17:35.617
ACTUALLY TO- INVEST. IN CLIMATE

01:17:35.684 --> 01:17:37.452
RESILIENCE AND I HAD A- I GUESS

01:17:37.519 --> 01:17:39.287
JUST A COMMENT TO START ON

01:17:39.354 --> 01:17:41.089
RESILIENCE PLANNING AND THEN A

01:17:41.156 --> 01:17:42.791
QUESTION. FOR THE

01:17:42.858 --> 01:17:45.293
ADMINISTRATION ON THE- A CLEAN

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.696

02:16:36.721 --> 02:16:38.456
YEARS IN THE GENERAL FUND- TO

02:16:38.523 --> 02:16:40.158

PROJECTS ON- STATE HIGHWAYS AND

02:16:43.428 --> 02:16:44.930
LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS AGAIN

02:16:44.996 --> 02:16:46.097
IT'S A VERY SIMILAR ISSUE JUST

02:16:46.164 --> 02:16:47.632
REALLY QUESTIONED WHETHER.

02:16:47.699 --> 02:16:50.001
THOSE ARE PRIORITIES FOR THE

02:16:50.068 --> 02:16:51.836
LEGISLATURE OR WHETHER YOU HAVE

02:16:51.903 --> 02:16:53.271
OTHER HIGHER GENERAL FUND

02:16:53.338 --> 02:16:54.339
PRIORITIES EITHER IN THE

PROJECT OR OTHER THINGS. OR YOU

02:17:06.818 --> 02:17:08.987
IN OTHER PARTS OF. THE BUDGET.

02:17:09.054 --> 02:17:10.522
TURNING TO THE DEAL PRO. THAT

02:17:10.589 --> 02:17:13.858
HEARD ABOUT. REALLY TWO POINTS

02:17:13.925 --> 02:17:14.559
TO MAKE ONE IS THERE ARE A

02:17:14.626 --> 02:17:15.527
COUPLE OF THE FOR. THAT AS RELY.

02:17:15.594 --> 02:17:16.695
AND IF YOU LOOK CLOUD THAT

02:17:16.761 --> 02:17:17.329
THINK ARE REALLY REASONABLE TO

02:17:17.395 --> 02:17:19.030
ADDRESS. THE- NEED TO SIR IN

02:17:19.097 --> 02:17:20.532
THE BETTER MEET WORKLOAD DEMAND

02:17:20.599 --> 02:17:21.299
BUT WE HAVE SOME TECH

02:17:21.366 --> 02:17:22.500
RECOMMENDATION THAT WILL GO

02:17:22.567 --> 02:17:23.969
INTO THE MID IN THE MOMENT BUT

02:17:24.035 --> 02:17:24.803
WE I HAVE MY COLLEAGUES HERE

02:17:24.869 --> 02:17:26.304
CONTAINS QUESTIONS BUT WE DO

02:17:26.371 --> 02:17:27.172
THINK THERE COUPLE TACKLE

02:17:27.238 --> 02:17:28.673
TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS YOU

02:17:28.740 --> 02:17:29.908
COULD ADOPT. TO INCREASE SOME

02:17:29.975 --> 02:17:31.409
OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEGISLATIVE

02:17:31.476 --> 02:17:33.311
OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY ON

02:17:33.378 --> 02:17:35.880
THOSE ON THOSE PROGRAMS- AND

02:17:35.947 --> 02:17:37.582
THEN ALSO WITH RESPECT TO THE-

02:17:37.649 --> 02:17:39.351
DMV'S DIGITAL ACCELERATION

02:17:39.417 --> 02:17:40.752
PROPOSAL WE DO HAVE SOME

02:17:40.819 --> 02:17:41.653

02:17:51.663 --> 02:17:52.597
FOR THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING

ACTIVITIES WILL CONTINUE TO

02:17:55.200 --> 02:17:57.068
WORK WITH ADMINISTRATION TO ASK

02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:24.022
POINTS TO MAKE ONE WE'RE

02:19:24.089 --> 02:19:26.024
LOOKING AT THE QUESTION OF- WHY

02:19:26.091 --> 02:19:27.525
THE MINISTRATION OF PROPOSING

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN WHAT

THAT WERE BUILT USING A AND

02:23:51.656 --> 02:23:53.257
DOWN IN YOUR YOUR AREA WHERE

02:23:53.324 --> 02:23:54.859

02:24:46.944 --> 02:24:49.113
I'M- FOR PURPOSES OF THE

02:24:49.180 --> 02:24:53.851
BUDGET- WHAT. HELLO JUST TOOK

02:24:53.918 --> 02:24:56.020
TO BRIEFLY REVIEW- YOU HAVE

02:24:56.087 --> 02:24:58.189
SPOKEN ABOUT THE FACT THAT- OF

02:24:58.256 --> 02:25:00.925
SOME OF YOUR FACILITIES- WERE

02:25:00.992 --> 02:25:02.126
ALSO I THINK BUILT IN THE

02:25:02.193 --> 02:25:05.496
SEVENTIES AND DRUG- THE NEEDS

02:25:05.563 --> 02:25:07.165
HAVE CHANGED SINCE THEN AND

02:25:07.231 --> 02:25:10.334

THESE BCPS ABOUT- UPGRADING AND

02:25:13.671 --> 02:25:14.705
CHANGING THE WAY WHICH YOU

INTERACT WITH- YOUR CUSTOMER

02:25:17.275 --> 02:25:20.511
BASE AND THAT UNDOUBTEDLY WILL

02:25:20.578 --> 02:25:24.082
CHANGE THE- OF THE NEEDS- AND

02:25:24.148 --> 02:25:25.950
HOPEFULLY THE SIZE OF THE

02:25:26.017 --> 02:25:28.252
FACILITIES- THAT YOU HAVE. AND

02:25:28.319 --> 02:25:31.355
I PROPOSED TO YOU THAT- WE

02:25:31.422 --> 02:25:32.156
SHOULD BE LOOKING AT SOME OF

02:25:32.223 --> 02:25:34.692
THESE OF FACILITIES WHICH ARE

02:25:34.759 --> 02:25:36.627
LOCATED TYPICALLY ARE NOT LARGE

02:25:36.694 --> 02:25:39.564
BLACKTOP BUT- OF A PARKING

02:25:39.630 --> 02:25:41.132
AREAS WITH RELATIVELY SMALL

02:25:41.199 --> 02:25:42.834
BUILDINGS WE SHOULD BE LOOKING

02:25:42.900 --> 02:25:44.936
AT SOME OF THAT PROPERTY OPFER

02:25:45.002 --> 02:25:47.805
HOUSING AS THE GOVERNOR HAS- OF

SORT OF DAYLIGHTING THAT ISSUE-

02:25:54.946 --> 02:25:57.748
IT IS THERE ARE A BUDGET

02:25:57.815 --> 02:25:58.850
ALLOCATION THAT WOULD BE

02:25:58.916 --> 02:26:02.720
HELPFUL IN PURSUING- SOME FIRST

02:26:02.787 --> 02:26:08.392
STEPS IN AND- LOOKING. AT THAT

02:26:08.459 --> 02:26:10.561
ISSUE. NOT A GOOD QUESTION CHEN

02:26:10.628 --> 02:26:12.563
I'LL AT IN THE FINAL AND I

02:26:12.630 --> 02:26:14.165
DON'T THINK WE HAVE A SPECIFIC

BASICALLY STEPS WE WOULD NEED

02:27:42.186 --> 02:27:43.754
TAKE- TO LEAD. CONSOLIDATION

02:27:43.821 --> 02:27:45.356

ELSEWHERE- INTO HEADQUARTERS-

02:28:05.876 --> 02:28:09.914
WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO- TO-

02:28:09.981 --> 02:28:11.716
CLOSE SOME OFFICES- IN THE

02:28:11.782 --> 02:28:17.255
FUTURE. WELL I APPRECIATE THAT

02:28:17.321 --> 02:28:19.523
AND I JUST REALLY WANT TO PUT

02:28:19.590 --> 02:28:23.261
THIS OUT THERE THAT WE'VE LONG

02:28:23.327 --> 02:28:27.832
DISCUSS TO. PRIORITIZING USING

02:28:27.898 --> 02:28:30.001
UNDER UTILIZED OR UNDERUTILIZED

02:28:30.067 --> 02:28:33.204
A SURPLUS- A STATE LAND FOR

02:28:33.271 --> 02:28:35.573
HOUSING PURPOSES- THIS IS NOT A

02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:37.908
NEW DISCUSSION- AND YET WE'VE

02:28:37.975 --> 02:28:41.045
SEEN PRECIOUS LITTLE OF FOLK-

02:28:41.112 --> 02:28:43.281
THAT TRANSITION ACTUALLY TAKE

02:28:43.347 --> 02:28:46.217
PLACE AND TOOK SO THIS IS

02:28:46.284 --> 02:28:48.786
BUDGET SUB THREE IT'S NOT- ARE

02:28:48.853 --> 02:28:50.955
OVERSIGHT IS AN OVER HOUSING

02:28:51.022 --> 02:28:54.458
BUT- THERE ARE PLACES WHERE WE

02:28:54.525 --> 02:28:58.996
OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY-

02:28:59.063 --> 02:28:59.764
THIS KIND OF UNDER UTILIZED

02:28:59.830 --> 02:29:01.666
RESOURCE. SO THAT WE CAN

02:29:01.732 --> 02:29:03.467
ADDRESS THIS MOST PRESSING

02:29:03.534 --> 02:29:06.304

UTILIZING THOSE THOSE THOSE

02:29:16.247 --> 02:29:17.848
PROPERTIES AND I DON'T MEAN TO

02:29:17.915 --> 02:29:24.255
PICK ON A DMV HERE- I THINK- TO

THE DISCUSSION AROUND TO AROUND

02:29:30.628 --> 02:29:31.562

TO HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE- TO

02:30:06.664 --> 02:30:08.933
BE THERE TO INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:09.867

OTHER WORDS COMMAND ECONOMIES

HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE QUICK

02:30:19.410 --> 02:30:21.912
TRANSITIONS BECAUSE THEY- MAKE

02:30:21.979 --> 02:30:23.514
THOSE KIND OF INVESTMENTS AND I

02:30:23.581 --> 02:30:25.950
THINK THAT HOPEFULLY WE WILL.

02:30:26.016 --> 02:30:27.785
BE AHEAD OF THE CURVE RATHER

02:30:27.852 --> 02:30:29.320
THAN BEHIND THE CURVE IN TERMS

02:30:29.387 --> 02:30:31.322
OF RECHARGING STATIONS ALL

02:30:31.389 --> 02:30:33.157
ACROSS THE BOARD- BUT I

02:30:33.224 --> 02:30:35.626
APPRECIATE THAT- HERE- FOR THIS

02:30:35.693 --> 02:30:37.161
HAVE BUSES AND TRUCKS AND LIKE

02:30:41.966 --> 02:30:44.635
IN TERMS OF THE DMV- TECHNOLOGY

02:30:44.702 --> 02:30:47.004
ADJUSTMENTS- THAT YOU HAVE

02:30:47.071 --> 02:30:49.673
COMING UP- WE HAVE SUCH A LONG

02:30:49.740 --> 02:30:52.710
HISTORY OF COST OVERRUNS AND

02:30:52.777 --> 02:30:54.578
DELAYS- IN THE STATE OF

02:30:54.645 --> 02:30:56.113
CALIFORNIA WHEN WE TRY TO

02:30:56.180 --> 02:30:57.715
IMPLEMENT- THE PSYCHES

02:30:57.782 --> 02:31:00.117
PROJECTS. I'D LIKE TO STRONGLY

02:31:00.184 --> 02:31:02.353
ENCOURAGE- THE DEPARTMENT TO

02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:05.322
WORK WITH THE I. T.

02:31:05.389 --> 02:31:07.091
PROFESSIONALS IN THE STATE OF

02:31:07.158 --> 02:31:09.393
CALIFORNIA AND NOT EXCLUSIVELY

02:31:09.460 --> 02:31:11.562
RELY ON OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS WHO

02:31:11.629 --> 02:31:13.697
DON'T HAVE. THE SAME KIND OF

02:31:13.764 --> 02:31:15.399
COMMITMENT TO LONG TERM SUCCESS

02:31:15.466 --> 02:31:19.003
OF THE STATE AS A HAS PEOPLE

02:31:19.069 --> 02:31:20.971
INSIDE DO THERE'S TRADITIONALLY

02:31:21.038 --> 02:31:22.306
AND BUREAUCRACIES TENSION

02:31:22.373 --> 02:31:23.841
BETWEEN THE I. T. DEPARTMENT

02:31:23.908 --> 02:31:25.042
AND THE DEPARTMENT TRYING TO DO

02:31:25.109 --> 02:31:26.710
THE IMPLEMENTATION I THINK WE

02:31:26.777 --> 02:31:28.479
HAVE TO BRING THAT TO AN END

02:31:28.546 --> 02:31:34.251
AND I HOPE THAT- THE DMV WILL.

02:31:34.318 --> 02:31:38.055
WELL TAKE A- TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

02:31:38.122 --> 02:31:39.857
SOME OF THE OF BEEN BROUGHT IN

02:31:39.924 --> 02:31:41.358
TO I. T. HAD TRY TO MAKE SURE

02:31:41.425 --> 02:31:42.026
THAT THEY HAVE A SMOOTH

02:31:42.092 --> 02:31:43.661
TRANSITION BUT I WILL BE

02:31:43.727 --> 02:31:46.063
WATCHING THAT WOULD CLOSELY- TO

02:31:46.130 --> 02:31:46.797
MAKE SURE PROFESSIONALLY

02:31:46.864 --> 02:31:50.201
HANDLED NUMBER THREE- I DON'T

02:31:50.267 --> 02:31:51.936
WANT TO GO INTO THE DETAILS BUT

02:31:52.002 --> 02:31:54.038
I WOULD LIKE ALEJO TO KEEP

02:31:54.104 --> 02:31:56.207
CONTINUE TO LOOK AT- THE

02:31:56.273 --> 02:31:57.675
BROADBAND INVESTMENT THE MIDDLE

02:31:57.741 --> 02:32:00.778
MILE INVESTMENT IN PARTICULAR-

02:32:00.845 --> 02:32:02.980
I THINK OVERALL THAT IF YOU

02:32:03.047 --> 02:32:04.482
HAVE TO SAY THAT IF PEOPLE

02:32:04.548 --> 02:32:06.450
WORK- CONNECTED TO ELECTRICITY

02:32:06.517 --> 02:32:08.385
NOW- THEY WOULD REALLY BE AT

THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO KEEP

02:35:41.765 --> 02:35:44.635
THESE OF VEHICLES CHARGED UP.

02:35:44.702 --> 02:35:45.869
IN MY SAME COMMENTS WOULD BE

THEY CURRENTLY DO RIGHT NOW.

02:35:58.916 --> 02:35:59.616
AND WE DON'T HAVE THE

02:36:06.957 --> 02:36:08.759
PICK UP IN THE COMMUNITY SO I

02:36:08.826 --> 02:36:10.027
THINK WE NEED TO REALLY MAKE

02:36:10.094 --> 02:36:10.861
THE INVESTMENT FOR THESE

02:36:10.928 --> 02:36:12.429

BUT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION

02:36:33.784 --> 02:36:35.185
DOLLARS FOR ARTWORK I THINK WE

02:36:35.252 --> 02:36:36.854
COULD USE A LOT MORE. OF

02:36:36.920 --> 02:36:38.522
THERE'S A LOT MORE NEEDED

02:36:38.589 --> 02:36:40.924

THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SPENDING

02:37:12.389 --> 02:37:14.024
CURRENTLY A YEAR TO YEAR. IT

02:37:14.091 --> 02:37:14.825
APPEARS THAT THEY WOULD ONLY

02:37:14.892 --> 02:37:16.260
NEED THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY IF

02:37:16.326 --> 02:37:17.795
THEY WERE GOING TO DRASTICALLY

02:37:17.861 --> 02:37:19.496

WONDERING WHAT CHANGES YOU'RE

02:37:23.133 --> 02:37:24.635
ANTICIPATING IN THE NEXT COUPLE

02:37:24.701 --> 02:37:27.137
OF YEARS. TO JUSTIFY THIS KIND

02:37:27.204 --> 02:37:29.039
OF AN INCREASE OVER WHAT

02:37:29.106 --> 02:37:30.974
THEY'RE CURRENTLY SPENDING ON

02:37:31.041 --> 02:37:43.086

KNOW THAT OUT EXPENDITURES MAY

02:37:57.534 --> 02:37:59.803
TAKE A COUPLE OF YEARS SO THE

02:37:59.870 --> 02:38:01.171
FOUR POINT TWO BILLION REQUEST

MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD

02:38:10.948 --> 02:38:13.917
UNDERTAKERS SEGMENT WOULD COST

02:38:13.984 --> 02:38:15.519
THIRTEEN POINT EIGHT BILLION SO

02:38:15.586 --> 02:38:17.321
JUST CONSISTENT WITH CAPITAL

02:38:17.387 --> 02:38:19.823

GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDING THIS IS

02:38:43.914 --> 02:38:45.749
ANTICIPATING FURTHER

SEGMENT MADERA TO BAKERSFIELD

02:38:58.295 --> 02:38:59.630
RIGHT SO WITH A LESSER

02:38:59.696 --> 02:39:00.797
APPROPRIATION THEY COULD STILL

02:39:00.864 --> 02:39:03.700
CONTINUE CONSTRUCTION EXACTLY

02:39:03.767 --> 02:39:07.871
AS THEY'RE PROCEEDING RIGHT NOW.

02:39:07.938 --> 02:39:10.641
THERE YES BUT THERE WOULD BE

02:39:10.707 --> 02:39:13.176
SOME RISK AND THERE COULD BE

02:39:13.243 --> 02:39:13.710
SOME CHALLENGES IN THEIR

02:39:13.777 --> 02:39:16.680

PARTICULARLY- D. A LECTOR

02:41:38.388 --> 02:41:40.857
VEHICLES ARE ARE ACTUALLY KIND

02:41:40.924 --> 02:41:41.558
OF HARD TO FIND AN EXTREMELY

02:41:41.625 --> 02:41:43.226
EXPENSIVE AS MY COLLEAGUE

02:42:09.820 --> 02:42:11.655
WE WILL GET BACK TO WHEN WE- TO

02:42:11.721 --> 02:42:13.723
RELEASE THAT AND THEN- CONFIRM-

02:42:13.790 --> 02:42:15.158
WHETHER THE CURRENT PORTFOLIO

02:42:15.225 --> 02:42:16.927
APPROACH WOULD BE MAINTAINED.

02:42:16.993 --> 02:42:18.762
OKAY SO MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE

02:42:18.829 --> 02:42:19.529
TO TAKE A CLOSE LOOK

02:42:19.596 --> 02:42:20.397
PARTICULARLY THE HEAVY DUTY

02:42:20.464 --> 02:42:22.732
SECTOR- ARE A NON ATTAINMENT

02:42:22.799 --> 02:42:24.868
AIR QUALITY DISTRICTS- NEED

02:42:24.935 --> 02:42:26.803
SOME VERY SHORT TERM RELIEF-

02:42:26.870 --> 02:42:28.071
FROM THE AIR QUALITY IMPACTS

02:42:28.138 --> 02:42:30.340
OF. A DRAYAGE TRUCKS AND OTHER

02:42:30.407 --> 02:42:32.309
HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES AND THEY

02:42:32.375 --> 02:42:33.310
FEEL THAT IT'S GOING TO BE

02:42:33.376 --> 02:42:34.478
DIFFICULT TO ATTAIN THAT RIGHT

02:42:34.544 --> 02:42:36.913
NOW WITH THE ZERO EMISSION%

02:42:36.980 --> 02:42:37.981
VEHICLES ALTHOUGH THAT IS THE

02:42:38.048 --> 02:42:40.217
GOAL- BUT THAT GETTING SOME OF

02:42:40.283 --> 02:42:42.018
THOSE DIESEL TRUCKS WALKED OUT

02:42:42.085 --> 02:42:43.453
WITH NATURAL GAS IS SOMETHING

02:42:43.520 --> 02:42:43.987
THAT THEY COULD DO PRETTY

02:42:44.054 --> 02:42:45.555
QUICKLY FOR. NOT A TREMENDOUS

02:42:45.622 --> 02:42:46.723
AMOUNT OF MONEY WOULD PROVIDE A

02:42:46.790 --> 02:42:48.592
LOT OF AIR QUALITY RELIEF- IN A

02:42:48.658 --> 02:42:50.427
SECTOR WHERE. WHEN THOSE TRUCKS

02:42:50.494 --> 02:42:51.595
GOING TO GET WORSE WALKED OUT

02:42:51.661 --> 02:42:52.729
THEY'RE BASICALLY GOING TO

02:42:52.796 --> 02:42:55.098
DIESEL- MOST OF THEM BECAUSE

02:42:55.165 --> 02:42:56.766
IT'S STILL SO THERE SO STILL

02:42:56.833 --> 02:42:59.336
SUCH A- A DELTA BETWEEN THE

COST OF THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE

02:43:01.605 --> 02:43:02.472
THE AVAILABILITY AND THEN THE

02:43:02.539 --> 02:43:04.074

SYSTEM WE WOULD BE USING OUR

02:45:42.499 --> 02:45:44.701

HAS TO DO WITH THE INTERACTION

02:46:23.540 --> 02:46:24.741
WITH THE GROWING PROBLEM OF

02:46:24.808 --> 02:46:26.776
HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS. AND THE

02:46:26.843 --> 02:46:29.612
DIFFICULTY. THAT MY LOCAL ARM

02:46:29.679 --> 02:46:32.115
CITIES HAVE. A LOT OF TIMES IN

02:46:32.182 --> 02:46:34.050
MAINTAINING. AND JUST FRANKLY

02:46:34.117 --> 02:46:35.452
DEALING WITH HOMELESS

02:46:35.518 --> 02:46:36.519
ENCAMPMENTS ARE ON CALTRANS

02:46:36.586 --> 02:46:38.221
PROPERTY BECAUSE OF THE MIX OF

02:46:38.288 --> 02:46:40.190
AGENCIES. AND THE INABILITY FOR

02:46:40.256 --> 02:46:42.459
LOCAL CITIES OUT LA SANITATION

02:46:42.525 --> 02:46:45.095
DISTRICT FOR INSTANCE TO ACCESS

02:46:45.161 --> 02:46:45.695
CALTRANS PROPERTY TO DO CLEAN

02:46:45.762 --> 02:46:48.365

THE RIGHT AND NEIGHBORHOODS.

02:46:52.936 --> 02:46:53.870
AND SO THAT CITIES DON'T HAVE

02:46:53.937 --> 02:46:55.004
ACCESS TO THE PROPERTY THE SAME

02:46:55.071 --> 02:46:56.239
WAY THAT THEY WOULD IF IT WAS

02:46:56.306 --> 02:46:58.208
JUST ON A REGULAR CITY STREET.

02:46:58.274 --> 02:46:59.642
SO I'M WONDERING HOW YOU SEE

02:46:59.709 --> 02:47:00.944
THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE

02:47:01.010 --> 02:47:02.712

THE OR IF THIS IS COMPLETELY

02:47:13.456 --> 02:47:14.891
SILO TO WEIGH IN. SORT OF GUY

02:47:14.958 --> 02:47:16.860
HOW HOW. IF YOU HAVE AN AREA

02:47:16.926 --> 02:47:18.228
THAT'S BEEN AN ENCAMPMENT IN.

02:47:18.294 --> 02:47:21.030
THE CITY'S SORT OF CLEAN IT UP

02:47:21.097 --> 02:47:21.564
AND TRY TO HOPEFULLY MOVE

02:47:21.631 --> 02:47:22.599
PEOPLE INTO SERVICES. HOW WOULD

02:47:22.665 --> 02:47:23.733
THIS INTERACTION WITH ANY

02:47:29.372 --> 02:47:30.974
PAST YEAR TRANSPARENCY TAKEN A

02:47:31.040 --> 02:47:32.409

02:47:32.475 --> 02:47:33.877
THAT WE ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS ON

02:47:33.943 --> 02:47:35.879
THE STATE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM

02:47:35.945 --> 02:47:37.147

02:47:37.213 --> 02:47:38.515

WANT TO BE DOING THAT EITHER

02:49:41.771 --> 02:49:43.039

ABLE TO OFFER PEOPLE SERVICES.

02:49:44.641 --> 02:49:45.875
I GUESS YOU KNOW JUST

02:49:45.942 --> 02:49:46.576
FUNDAMENTALLY I WAS WONDERING

JUST TO GIVE THEM ANY RELIEF.

02:49:55.919 --> 02:49:57.587
AND SOUNDS LIKE NOT REALLY

02:49:57.654 --> 02:49:59.322
EXCEPT AFTER THE FACT AFTER

THEY DO OFFER SERVICES AND THEY

02:50:01.324 --> 02:50:02.392
DO CLEAN UP SOME OF THESE AREAS

02:50:02.458 --> 02:50:03.893
THAT THERE'S- MAYBE SOME SORT

02:50:03.960 --> 02:50:05.929
OF RESTORATION MONEY TO HELP.

02:50:05.995 --> 02:50:07.297
YOU MAKE THOSE AREAS A LITTLE

02:50:07.363 --> 02:50:09.999
BIT BETTER AND SOMETHING B. C.

02:50:10.066 --> 02:50:11.534
FOR AN AND MORE- INGRAINED INTO

02:50:11.601 --> 02:50:12.702
THE COMMUNITY SO I THINK THAT'S

02:50:12.769 --> 02:50:14.571
WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU. BUT

02:50:14.637 --> 02:50:15.705
I AGREE I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO

02:50:17.173 --> 02:50:19.509
AS SORT OF. YOU KNOW M. AND BY

02:50:19.576 --> 02:50:20.476
THE WAY FROM THE CITY SIDE

02:50:20.543 --> 02:50:22.345
MOVING PEOPLE OFF OF CALTRANS

02:50:22.412 --> 02:50:23.546
PROPERTY JUST SO THAT THEY CAN

02:50:23.613 --> 02:50:24.514
MOVED ON THE BLOCK IS NOT

02:50:24.581 --> 02:50:26.516
pOPTIMAL EITHER I MEAN. YOU KNOW

HOUSED. SO THE CITIES ARE

02:50:33.556 --> 02:50:34.591
TRYING TO DO THAT I KNOW

02:50:34.657 --> 02:50:35.825
CALTRANS IS NOT TRYING TO DO

02:50:35.892 --> 02:50:38.695
THAT- ABOUT WHEN MY CITY SAW

02:50:38.761 --> 02:50:40.196
THIS PARTICULAR ALLOCATION.

02:50:40.263 --> 02:50:47.070
THEY. ALSO SAID- IS THIS

02:50:47.136 --> 02:50:47.704

WITH THIS. YOU WANT TO

02:50:49.272 --> 02:50:50.006
ACKNOWLEDGE THE IS FINDING AN

02:50:50.073 --> 02:50:50.640
THE BUDGET THE PROPOSED THAT WE

02:50:50.707 --> 02:50:53.810
HELP WITH- HAD A BIG ADDING

02:50:53.876 --> 02:50:54.844
FIFTEEN CABINET WHILE WE'RE ON

02:50:54.911 --> 02:50:57.113
BE LOCATION SOLUTION. AND THE

02:50:57.180 --> 02:50:58.915
IRON INCREASING THE FUNDING FOR

02:50:58.982 --> 02:51:00.650
TRASH SHOULD BE AND UP IN AREAS

02:51:00.717 --> 02:51:01.918
YOU KNOW NEAR AN ACTIVE CAN'T

02:51:01.985 --> 02:51:03.720
SAY THERE IS FINDING AMERICORPS

02:51:03.786 --> 02:51:04.988
THAT IN PARTICULAR OKAY THAT IS

02:51:05.054 --> 02:51:05.755
GOOD TO KNOW AND SOMETHING THAT

02:51:05.822 --> 02:51:06.923
I THINK THE CITIES WILL BE

02:51:06.990 --> 02:51:09.025
HAPPY TO HEAR AS WELL. AND THEN

02:51:09.092 --> 02:51:10.960
MY LAST QUESTIONS ARE ABOUT THE

02:51:11.027 --> 02:51:12.762
CLIMATE- THE ONE POINT THREE

02:51:12.829 --> 02:51:15.765
BILLION DOLLARS- FOR THE IMPACT

02:51:15.832 --> 02:51:17.066
OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND MY

02:51:17.133 --> 02:51:21.270
QUESTION IS I DON'T. KNOW IF

02:51:21.337 --> 02:51:21.838
IT'S FOR YOU OR SOMEONE ELSE

02:51:21.904 --> 02:51:22.472
BUT I WILL ASK IT. YOU WE KNOW

02:51:22.538 --> 02:51:22.905
THAT CLIMATE CHANGE

02:51:22.972 --> 02:51:23.906
INCREASINGLY IT IS IMPACTING

02:51:23.973 --> 02:51:24.607
AND THREATENING OUR

02:51:24.674 --> 02:51:26.209
INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE HAVE SOME

02:51:26.275 --> 02:51:26.976
CRITICAL TRANSPORTATION

02:51:27.043 --> 02:51:28.645
INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT IS VERY

02:51:28.711 --> 02:51:29.746
MUCH UNDER THREAT FROM CLIMATE

02:51:29.812 --> 02:51:30.880
CHANGE PARTICULARLY SOME RAIL

02:51:30.947 --> 02:51:32.248
LINES THAT ARE ALONG. YOU KNOW

02:51:32.315 --> 02:51:33.449
CLIFFS DOWN IN THE SAN DIEGO

02:51:33.516 --> 02:51:36.119
AREA. AND I'M WONDERING HOW.

02:51:36.185 --> 02:51:37.286
THE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO

02:51:37.353 --> 02:51:38.187
PRIORITIZE SOME OF THE

02:51:38.254 --> 02:51:39.722
INVESTMENTS THE TRANSPORTATION

02:51:39.789 --> 02:51:41.824
INVESTMENTS. THAT ARE. MAYBE

BUT CERTAINLY WE KNOW. THAT

02:51:45.795 --> 02:51:47.664
WITH CLIMATE CHANGE THEY ARE

02:51:47.730 --> 02:51:49.732
EXTREMELY HIGH RISK AND- THAT

02:51:49.799 --> 02:51:50.933
IT'S BETTER TO START THE

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:51.901
PROCESS OF MOVING THEM

02:51:51.968 --> 02:51:53.836
SOMEWHERE SAFE FOR. NOW RATHER

02:51:53.903 --> 02:51:56.339

PRIORITIZING THAT WITHIN THIS

02:52:04.647 --> 02:52:09.285
BUDGET. AND I WANT TO

CHAPTER OF THEIR LIFE. ALSO

02:59:41.971 --> 02:59:43.506
THROUGH THAT PROGRAM THERE'S AN

02:59:43.572 --> 02:59:44.807
OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE FOLKS TO

02:59:44.874 --> 02:59:46.242
GROW INTO POSITIONS WITH

02:59:46.308 --> 02:59:48.344
CALTRANS. THEY WERE INTRODUCING

NEW WELFARE YOUR MATE AND

02:59:50.513 --> 02:59:51.380
COMPLICATIONS WITHIN THE

THE STATE WHAT A- AND THAT

03:00:40.963 --> 03:00:41.463
WOULD BE THROUGH THE COUNT.

03:00:41.530 --> 03:00:42.698
FORCE BUT ALL THROUGH THAT THE

03:00:42.765 --> 03:00:44.500

ENCAMPMENTS THAT ARE- ON THE

03:01:19.268 --> 03:01:21.737
HIGHWAYS- I KNOW IN MY DISTRICT

03:01:21.804 --> 03:01:24.406
SOMETIMES WE HAVE SOME THAT ARE

03:01:24.473 --> 03:01:28.611
ABANDONED RIGHT LIKE- MAYBE THE

03:01:28.677 --> 03:01:29.645

HOMELESSNESS FOUND HOME OR OR

03:01:32.181 --> 03:01:33.749
WAS PLACED IN PERMANENT

03:01:33.816 --> 03:01:36.285
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING BUT THEN-

03:01:36.352 --> 03:01:38.621
ITEMS REMAIN BEHIND AND I KNOW

03:01:38.687 --> 03:01:40.022
I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THAT

03:01:40.089 --> 03:01:42.625
REQUIRES OR COULD POTENTIALLY

03:01:42.691 --> 03:01:44.693
REQUIRE HAZARDOUS WASTE CREW-

03:01:44.760 --> 03:01:46.629
AND SO I WASN'T SURE IF THE- IF

03:01:46.695 --> 03:01:49.231
THAT'S A SEPARATE. PROGRAM OR

03:01:49.298 --> 03:01:50.699
IN SEPARATE LINE ITEM IN YOUR

03:01:50.766 --> 03:01:52.001
BUDGET I KNOW IN A PREVIOUS

03:01:52.067 --> 03:01:54.136
BUDGET SUB THREE HEARING WE DID

03:01:54.203 --> 03:01:55.404
HEAR FROM CALTRANS WHERE THEY

03:01:55.471 --> 03:01:57.673
WERE REQUESTING I THINK IT WAS

03:01:57.740 --> 03:01:59.174
TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR HAS

03:01:59.241 --> 03:02:01.477
YOU KNOW CONTRACTORS- THAT

03:02:01.543 --> 03:02:03.379
SPECIALIZE IN HAZARDOUS WASTE

03:02:03.445 --> 03:02:05.614
THAT MAYBE YOUR CREWS DON'T

03:02:05.681 --> 03:02:07.516
HAVE THE TRAINING YOU KNOW TO

03:02:07.583 --> 03:02:10.586
CLEAN. OUT AND SO DOES THIS

03:02:10.653 --> 03:02:11.687
FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN IS

03:02:11.754 --> 03:02:12.655
THIS FOR EIGHTEEN MILLION

03:02:12.721 --> 03:02:14.390

WASTE. NINE NINE NUMBER

03:02:22.031 --> 03:02:23.565
HAZARDOUS WASTE SO THAT WE CAN

03:02:23.632 --> 03:02:25.301
INCREASE CLEANING I'M NOT

03:02:25.367 --> 03:02:27.236
ENCAMPMENTS BY PEOPLE EITHER

03:02:27.303 --> 03:02:29.171

OUT IN ADVANCE I MEAN CAN'T.

03:02:30.906 --> 03:02:33.208
DESCRIBE BUT IT'S NOT PART OF

03:02:33.275 --> 03:02:34.276
THE FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN

03:02:34.343 --> 03:02:37.579
MILLION. IT OR THAT. IT IS A

03:02:37.646 --> 03:02:39.548
PART OF THAT HORRENDOUS OKAY

03:02:39.615 --> 03:02:41.784
THAT'S THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR

03:02:41.850 --> 03:02:43.819
ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS. I KNOW

03:02:43.886 --> 03:02:45.988
I'M I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS

03:02:46.055 --> 03:02:48.490
PROGRAM AND LOOKING FORWARD. TO

03:02:48.557 --> 03:02:49.925
SEEING THE RESULTS OF IT AND

03:02:49.992 --> 03:02:51.994
THE IMPLEMENTATION- SO THANK

03:02:52.061 --> 03:02:54.029
YOU FOR YOUR ANSWERS AND FOR

03:02:54.096 --> 03:02:56.598
CLARIFIED SOME THINGS FOR ME-

03:02:56.665 --> 03:02:58.667
THE ONLY OTHER COMMENTS I HAD

03:02:58.734 --> 03:03:00.803
WERE ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL.

03:03:00.869 --> 03:03:02.571
I'M NOT REALLY ANY QUESTIONS

03:03:02.638 --> 03:03:04.907
JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS. YOU

03:03:04.973 --> 03:03:06.909
KNOW SOME COMMENTS THAT YOU

03:03:06.975 --> 03:03:08.577
KNOW I SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF A

03:03:08.644 --> 03:03:10.746
HIGH SPEED RAIL IN CALIFORNIA

03:03:10.813 --> 03:03:11.580
BUT I THINK OUR CURRENT

03:03:11.647 --> 03:03:14.383
APPROACH. IS NOT WORKING. I

03:03:14.450 --> 03:03:15.984
THINK WE SHOULD CONSIDER YOU

03:03:16.051 --> 03:03:17.453
KNOW HAVING SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS

03:03:17.519 --> 03:03:19.521
ABOUT WHAT STEPS WE COULD TAKE.

03:03:19.588 --> 03:03:20.923
UP TO MAKE SURE WE'RE MOVING

03:03:20.989 --> 03:03:22.691
FORWARD IN A WAY THAT MAKES

03:03:22.758 --> 03:03:25.194
FISCAL SENSE- YEAH I REMAIN

03:03:25.260 --> 03:03:26.995
CONCERNED THAT. THE MATH

03:03:27.062 --> 03:03:28.564
DOESN'T ADD UP FOR THE HSR

03:03:28.630 --> 03:03:31.867
PROJECT- I HOPE THAT WERE ABLE

03:03:31.934 --> 03:03:33.335
TO GET FEDERAL ASSISTANCE NO

03:03:33.402 --> 03:03:34.803
SIGNIFICANT. FEDERAL

03:03:34.870 --> 03:03:37.406
ASSISTANCE- IF ESPECIALLY IF

03:03:37.473 --> 03:03:40.309
OUR COUNTRY WANTS. THIS PROJECT

03:03:40.376 --> 03:03:42.544
TO BE A MODEL NATIONWIDE FOR

03:03:42.611 --> 03:03:43.779
WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH HIGH

03:03:43.846 --> 03:03:46.315
SPEED RAIL- BUT I THINK RIGHT

03:03:46.382 --> 03:03:49.218
NOW WE HAVE TO BALANCE- YOU

03:03:49.284 --> 03:03:51.520
KNOW AS LEGISLATORS HOW MUCH

03:03:51.587 --> 03:03:52.988
ARE CONSTITUENTS WILL BE ON THE

03:03:53.055 --> 03:03:55.824
HOOK. FOR INCLUDING- INCLUDING

03:03:55.891 --> 03:03:57.159
THOSE THAT LIVE IN LESS

03:03:57.226 --> 03:03:59.328
AFFLUENT COMMITTEE COMMITTEES

03:03:59.395 --> 03:04:00.462
FOR YOU KNOW HOW MUCH ARE WE

03:04:00.529 --> 03:04:01.263
CAN BE ON THE HOOK FOR THIS

03:04:01.330 --> 03:04:03.732
PROJECT- THERE ARE OTHER

03:04:03.799 --> 03:04:04.600
APPROACHES THAT HAVE BEEN

03:04:04.666 --> 03:04:06.802
PRESENTED THAT CAN INCREASE

03:04:06.869 --> 03:04:08.637
WELL RIDERSHIP AND I HOPE THAT.

03:04:08.704 --> 03:04:10.239
THOSE WILL BE PART OF THE

03:04:10.305 --> 03:04:12.775
DISCUSSION AS WE MOVE. INTO

03:04:12.841 --> 03:04:15.411
THIS. THE REMAINING BUDGET

03:04:15.477 --> 03:04:20.949
DISCUSSIONS. IN THE NEXT FEW

03:04:21.016 --> 03:04:21.850
WEEKS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY

03:04:21.917 --> 03:04:26.121
MUCH- I AM GOING TO. MAKE A

03:04:26.188 --> 03:04:27.389
COUPLE OF COMMENTS ABOUT

03:04:27.456 --> 03:04:29.091
BROADBAND JUST TO RETURN TO

03:04:29.158 --> 03:04:30.926
THAT TOPIC VERY BRIEFLY- WE

03:04:30.993 --> 03:04:32.461
REALLY DON'T HAVE TIME TO HAVE

03:04:32.528 --> 03:04:35.230
A FULLER. A DISCUSSION OF MY

03:04:35.297 --> 03:04:38.467
QUESTIONS SO I'LL ASK- WHOEVER

03:04:38.534 --> 03:04:41.503
IT IS THAT- NEEDS TO RESPOND TO

03:04:41.570 --> 03:04:43.806
THEM TO PLEASE DO SO WITH ME

03:04:43.872 --> 03:04:47.810
OFFLINE- BUT- ONE QUESTION I

03:04:47.876 --> 03:04:50.979
HAVE IS- WE KNOW THAT- MILLIONS

03:04:51.046 --> 03:04:53.549
OF CALIFORNIA'S. STILL DO NOT

03:04:53.615 --> 03:04:57.553
HAVE ACCESS TO BROADBAND- AND

03:04:57.619 --> 03:04:58.787
THE AND THE REASON IS THEY

03:04:58.854 --> 03:05:01.490
CAN'T AFFORD THE SERVICE AND SO

03:05:01.557 --> 03:05:02.925
I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS

03:05:02.991 --> 03:05:05.928
INTENDED TO BRING. A CABLE TO

03:05:05.994 --> 03:05:07.729
PEOPLE'S HOMES ULTIMATELY BUT

03:05:07.796 --> 03:05:08.964
WHAT ARE WE DOING TO NARROW

03:05:09.031 --> 03:05:12.301
THAT- ISSUE OF AFFORDABILITY.

03:05:12.367 --> 03:05:14.269
AND DUG OUT THE OTHER QUESTION

03:05:14.336 --> 03:05:16.271
I HAVE HAS TO DO WITH

03:05:16.338 --> 03:05:18.607
TECHNOLOGY- IT SEEMS THAT WE

03:05:18.674 --> 03:05:21.543
ARE RELYING ON A CABLE AND

03:05:21.610 --> 03:05:25.981
ASSUMING THAT- THE PUBLIC WILL

03:05:26.048 --> 03:05:28.383
CONNECT TO THE CABLE AT THE END

03:05:28.450 --> 03:05:31.720
OF THE DAY AND WILL ACCESS-

03:05:31.787 --> 03:05:35.057
HIGH SPEED DATA- BROADBAND. IN

03:05:35.123 --> 03:05:37.893
IN DOING SO. BUT I'M NOT SO

03:05:37.960 --> 03:05:39.161
SURE THAT'S WHERE THE PUBLIC IS

03:05:39.228 --> 03:05:41.930
TODAY- I THINK I LIKE IT A LOT

03:05:41.997 --> 03:05:46.034
OF PEOPLE- ACCESS THE INTERNET

03:05:46.101 --> 03:05:47.636
AND UTILIZED BROADBAND OR

03:05:47.703 --> 03:05:50.239
UTILIZED THEIR- OTHER PERSONAL

03:05:50.305 --> 03:05:53.742
DEVICES- UGH UGH FOR ACCESSING

03:05:53.809 --> 03:05:55.410
THE INFORMATION AND THE THING

03:05:55.477 --> 03:05:57.779
SO THAT WE ALL TAKE FOR GRANTED

03:05:57.846 --> 03:06:01.250
TODAY AND SO. I WOULD BE

03:06:01.316 --> 03:06:03.352
INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHAT DATA

03:06:03.418 --> 03:06:05.187
IS OUT THERE SUPPORTING THE

03:06:05.254 --> 03:06:06.955
INVESTMENT OF BILLIONS OF

03:06:07.022 --> 03:06:11.093
DOLLARS- I'M NOT SAYING WE ARE

03:06:11.159 --> 03:06:12.928
BUT I'M HOPING THAT WE'RE NOT

03:06:12.995 --> 03:06:14.263
INVESTING IN WHAT ULTIMATELY

03:06:14.329 --> 03:06:17.099
WILL BE AN OBSOLETE TECHNOLOGY

03:06:17.165 --> 03:06:19.001
BY THE TIME WE ACTUALLY FINISH

03:06:19.067 --> 03:06:21.670
BUILDING CUT- THE SYSTEMS OUT

03:06:21.737 --> 03:06:23.438
OF WE NEED TO KNOW THAT THE

03:06:23.505 --> 03:06:25.974
CUSTOME BASE WILL BE THERE FOR
