01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.501
NECESSITY OF ADDING ANOTHER

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:06.970

BUSINESSES CAN BE MORE

01:00:18.614 --> 01:00:20.650
BURDENSOME THAN KEEPING A FILE

01:00:20.717 --> 01:00:21.951
FOLDER SO I GUESS I'M TRYING TO

01:00:22.018 --> 01:00:23.252
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S THE CHANGER

01:00:23.319 --> 01:00:24.153
TRYING TO SEEK IN THE PROBLEM

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:25.922

MOMENT- AGAIN. YOU DON'T HE

01:00:46.209 --> 01:00:47.443
THOUGHT WE WERE POINT FROM WAS

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:48.711
EXISTING LIKE BUILDING AT THAT

01:00:48.778 --> 01:00:50.146
THEY ALREADY KIND OF KEEP US

01:00:50.213 --> 01:00:53.583
RECORD SO AGAIN TRYING TO- I

01:00:53.649 --> 01:00:57.787
GUESS. KEEP IN MIND WITH. THE

01:00:57.854 --> 01:00:59.856
EASE OF- I GUESS BOTH FOR THE

01:00:59.922 --> 01:01:01.357
BUSINESS AND WITHOUT CREATING

01:01:01.424 --> 01:01:02.291
SOME ADDITIONAL YOU KNOW

01:01:02.358 --> 01:01:04.093

01:01:12.902 --> 01:01:14.303
LIKE. WHAT I'VE HEARD NOW TWICE

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:16.105
IS THAT THIS IS BASED ON OTHER

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:17.040
REQUIREMENTS THEY ALREADY HAVE

01:01:17.106 --> 01:01:18.041
WHICH MAKES ME BELIEVE THAT THIS

01:01:18.107 --> 01:01:20.343
ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE REQUIRING A

01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:22.278
FIVE YEAR ELECTRONIC RECORD IS

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:24.213
UNNECESSARY. ELSEWHERE THE

AIRPLANE FROM BUT I. MAYBE I

01:01:26.115 --> 01:01:27.050
JUST AM NOT GETTING CLARITY AND

WE CAN GET IT AFTER THE HEARING

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:31.120
THAT'S ALSO FINE I'M HAPPY TO

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:31.888
SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT I REALLY

01:01:31.954 --> 01:01:33.823
REALLY HOPE. THAT WE DON'T PUT

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:34.457
ADDITIONAL BURDENS ON BUSINESS

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:36.225
WHEN THEY DON'T AREN'T NECESSARY

01:01:36.292 --> 01:01:37.160
OR SOLVING A PROBLEM AGAIN THE

01:01:37.226 --> 01:01:38.828
OTHER CHANGES IN THIS BILL I

01:01:38.895 --> 01:01:40.329
THINK ARE CLEAR AND THAT PEACE.

01:01:40.396 --> 01:01:42.165
REMAINS A MYSTERY TO ME SO

01:01:42.231 --> 01:01:42.932
HOPEFULLY WE CAN CLARIFY IT AND

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:44.434
ENSURE THAT IT'S NOT.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.169

01:02:32.949 --> 01:02:35.218
ADD THAT THE ADDITIONAL-

01:02:35.284 --> 01:02:36.786
ENFORCEMENT OR THE ADDITIONAL

01:02:50.466 --> 01:02:51.834
THERE'S CONTINUITY AND WHAT THAT

01:02:51.901 --> 01:02:53.536
LOOKS LIKE BUT OF COURSE WE'RE-

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:54.737

ANALYSIS NOT ONLY FOR THIS BILL

01:08:02.211 --> 01:08:04.313
BUT FOR THE TWO UPCOMING BILLS-

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:06.649
BUT THIS LEGISLATION IS ON THE

01:08:06.715 --> 01:08:08.684
BILL TWO ONE ZERO SIX EIGHT AT

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:09.785
SIX TO MODERNIZE OUR STATE'S

01:08:09.852 --> 01:08:11.387
APPROACH TO STORMWATER. BUT

01:08:11.454 --> 01:08:13.322
WHICH IS THE LARGEST SOURCE OF

01:08:13.389 --> 01:08:15.191
US SOME WATER SOME POLLUTION IN

01:08:15.257 --> 01:08:18.194
OUR STATE- AND IT'S POLLUTION

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:19.862
THAT CAN CAUSE SOME SERIOUS

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:20.763
PUBLIC IN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:23.299
PROBLEMS AS WE KNOW THE STORM

01:08:23.365 --> 01:08:25.000
WATER IS THE WATER THAT RUNS OFF

01:08:25.067 --> 01:08:30.272
OF ROOFS SIDEWALKS IN OTHER PAID

01:08:30.339 --> 01:08:31.874
WATER THEN IT DRAINS INTO RUNOFF

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:34.810
CHANNELS THAT CRISSCROSS THROUGH

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:36.946
THE LANDSCAPE AND ALONG THE WAY

01:08:37.012 --> 01:08:38.614
THE WATER RUN OFF IT ACCUMULATED

01:08:38.681 --> 01:08:42.852
TOXIC SLEW OF CHEMICALS. OIL

01:08:42.918 --> 01:08:45.721
FERTILIZER TRASH HEAVIER HARD

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:48.257
METALS AND OTHER POLLUTANTS. B.

01:08:48.324 --> 01:08:51.026
B. FOR THE B. AFFORD ENTERS A

01:08:51.093 --> 01:08:52.895
STORM DRAIN AND EVENTUALLY MAKES

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:54.997
ITS WAY OUT INTO THE OCEAN. SO

01:08:55.064 --> 01:08:56.031
SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE FEDERAL

01:08:56.098 --> 01:08:58.300
CLEAN WATER ACT THIS IS THE

01:08:58.367 --> 01:09:00.903
FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THAT-

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:03.138
FEDERAL LAW WE HAVE MADE A LOT

01:09:03.205 --> 01:09:05.374
OF PROGRESS IS THE STATE NO WE

01:09:05.441 --> 01:09:06.775
HAVE- WE HAVE PROVEN AS A STATE

01:09:06.842 --> 01:09:08.177
THAT WE CAN CLEAN AND RESTORE

01:09:08.244 --> 01:09:10.279
OUR WATERWAYS IN MANY PARTS. OF

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:12.681
CALIFORNIA UNFORTUNATELY LITTLE

01:09:12.748 --> 01:09:13.916
PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:15.918
REDUCING STORM WATER- SOME

01:09:15.985 --> 01:09:19.555
POLLUTION- THE- ACROSS OUR

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:21.991
STATE. AND IT'S BECOMING A

01:09:22.057 --> 01:09:24.260
GROWING PROBLEM EVEN AS OUR

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:25.694
CURRENT- ARE PERMITS JUST

01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:27.596
IMPOSES SIGNIFICANT COSTS ON THE

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:30.866
REGULATED- THE- THE COMMUNITY.

01:09:30.933 --> 01:09:33.168
THE RESULT IS THAT- ESPECIALLY

01:09:33.235 --> 01:09:35.037
OUR MOST UNDERSERVED- SOME

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:37.139
COMMUNITIES WERE NOT ACHIEVING

01:09:37.206 --> 01:09:39.341
OUR WATER QUALITY GOALS. AND

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:41.510
WE'RE NOT ON TRACK TO DO SO. SO

01:09:41.577 --> 01:09:43.245
THIS LEGISLATION SEEKS TO

01:09:43.312 --> 01:09:45.247
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IN THREE WAYS

01:09:45.314 --> 01:09:47.483
FIRST AND MORE IMPORTANTLY- THIS

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:48.984
LEGISLATION WOULD REQUIRE THE

01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:50.886
STATE WATER BOARD TO CONDUCT A

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:53.255
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. BUT TO TAKE

01:09:53.322 --> 01:09:55.357
A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT HOW THE

01:09:55.424 --> 01:09:56.492
STATE'S STORMWATER PROGRAM CAN

01:09:56.559 --> 01:09:59.161
ACHIEVE SOME BETTER RESULTS AT

01:09:59.228 --> 01:10:01.263
LESS COST TO THE PERMIT THESE.

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:02.965
THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS SIMPLY NOT

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:06.835
WORKING FOR ANYONE. AND WE

01:10:06.902 --> 01:10:07.970
CERTAINLY NEED TO GET BACK TO

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:09.271
THE DRAWING BOARD. AND SECOND.

01:10:09.338 --> 01:10:10.906
THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE

01:10:10.973 --> 01:10:12.474
STATE WATER BOARD TO CREATE A

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:15.010
NEW PERMIT. A PERMIT THAT WOULD

01:10:15.077 --> 01:10:16.812
COVER SOME CURRENTLY UNREGULATED

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:18.614
SOURCES OF STORMWATER- SOME

01:10:18.681 --> 01:10:20.549
POLLUTION. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT

01:10:20.616 --> 01:10:23.118
THE BURDEN OF COMPLIANCE IS MORE

01:10:23.185 --> 01:10:25.521
FAIRLY. DISTRIBUTED ACROSS ALL

01:10:25.588 --> 01:10:27.890
SOURCES OF STORMWATER. AND WOULD

01:10:27.957 --> 01:10:29.124
ALSO CREATE REGULATORY

01:10:29.191 --> 01:10:30.626
CONSISTENCY THROUGHOUT

01:10:30.693 --> 01:10:32.728
CALIFORNIA. AND FINALLY THIS

01:10:32.795 --> 01:10:34.229
BILL WOULD MODERNIZE OUR

01:10:34.296 --> 01:10:36.599
STORMWATER DATA SYSTEMS. ARE SO

01:10:36.665 --> 01:10:37.967
THAT THEY WORK BETTER FOR BOTH

01:10:38.033 --> 01:10:42.271
REGULATORS AND- THE- PERMITIR

01:10:42.338 --> 01:10:44.707
THIS- AND TOGETHER THESE

01:10:44.773 --> 01:10:47.643
PROPOSALS SEEK TO PUT US BACK ON

01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:49.812
TRACK. AB THE C. TO PUT IT BACK

01:10:49.878 --> 01:10:51.947
ON TRACK TO MAKE PROGRESS IN

01:10:52.014 --> 01:10:52.514
ELIMINATING THESE DANGEROUS

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:54.617
STORM WATER- SOME POLLUTION

01:10:54.683 --> 01:10:55.951
WHICH AGAIN IS THE LARGEST

01:10:56.018 --> 01:10:58.654
SOURCE OF WATER- SOME POLLUTION

01:10:58.721 --> 01:11:00.789
ACROSS OUR ENTIRE STATE. BECAUSE

01:11:00.856 --> 01:11:02.424
IN ORDER TO PROVIDE CLEAN WATER

01:11:02.491 --> 01:11:04.093
TO ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WE

01:11:04.159 --> 01:11:05.995
MUST DO SO REGARDLESS OF INCOME.

01:11:06.061 --> 01:11:08.364
AND STATUS OR ZIP CODE YOU KNOW

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:10.032
ACCOMPLISHING THIS IS CRITICAL.

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:11.767
I IN THE MEANTIME WE'LL CONTINUE

01:11:11.834 --> 01:11:13.168

WE HAVE APPRECIATE. ALL OF THEIR

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:17.306
ENGAGEMENT- TO FURTHER REFINE

01:11:17.373 --> 01:11:18.807
THE LANGUAGE OF THIS LEGISLATION

01:11:18.874 --> 01:11:20.809
AND WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IS

01:11:20.876 --> 01:11:22.344
SEAN BOSWELL OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:11:22.411 --> 01:11:23.912

SUPPORT ON SOME LEGAL TWENTY ONE

01:11:44.867 --> 01:11:46.802
OF SIX- I WANTED TO ADDRESS

01:11:46.869 --> 01:11:48.170
SECTION THREE OF THE BILL WHICH

01:11:48.237 --> 01:11:49.705
IS THE COMMERCIAL. INSTITUTIONAL

01:11:49.772 --> 01:11:51.407
INDUSTRIAL STORMWATER PERMIT-

01:11:51.473 --> 01:11:53.676
THAT NUMBER RIVAS OF MENTION

01:11:53.742 --> 01:11:55.577
JUST A SECOND AGO. SO WE REALLY

01:11:55.644 --> 01:11:56.979
SEE THIS PERMIT IS AN EXCITING

01:11:57.046 --> 01:11:59.348
OPPORTUNITY UP BECAUSE IT WOULD

01:11:59.415 --> 01:12:00.916
ACCOMPLISH FOUR THINGS ONE IT

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:01.750
WOULD ADDRESS A CURRENTLY

01:12:01.817 --> 01:12:03.318
COMPLETELY UNREGULATED SOURCE OF

01:12:03.385 --> 01:12:05.354
STORMWATER POLLUTION. TO IT

01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:06.355
WOULD REDUCE THE LOCAL

01:12:06.422 --> 01:12:08.657
GOVERNMENTS CURRENT LIABILITY

01:12:08.724 --> 01:12:09.391
FOR THAT RUNOFF THAT'S COMING

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:11.026
OFF THOSE COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES

01:12:11.093 --> 01:12:12.861
AND THEN INTO THE LOCAL

01:12:12.928 --> 01:12:13.862
GOVERNMENTS MUNICIPAL STORM

01:12:13.929 --> 01:12:16.231
DRAIN. IT WOULD INCENTIVIZE

01:12:16.298 --> 01:12:18.300
STORMWATER CAPTURE AND RE USE

01:12:18.367 --> 01:12:20.903
AND COULD PROVIDE- A CREATIVE

01:12:20.969 --> 01:12:22.871
SOURCE OF CAR SHARING BETWEEN

01:12:22.938 --> 01:12:24.073
THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES AND

01:12:24.139 --> 01:12:25.674
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BUILD

01:12:25.741 --> 01:12:26.675
MORE CENTRALIZED STORMONT TO

01:12:26.742 --> 01:12:29.378
CAPTURE- ON A MORE REGIONAL

01:12:29.445 --> 01:12:31.714
BASIS. I IN LOS ANGELES THE U.

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:33.015
S. EPA IN THE REGIONAL BOARD ARE

01:12:33.082 --> 01:12:34.783
ABOUT TO RELEASE ONE OF THESE

01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:36.452
COMMERCIAL STORMONT PERMITS- IN

01:12:36.518 --> 01:12:38.787
APRIL. THEY ANTICIPATE IT WILL

01:12:38.854 --> 01:12:40.689
BE ADOPTED BY THIS SEPTEMBER SO

01:12:40.756 --> 01:12:42.357
ONLY SIX MONTHS AFTER- THE

01:12:42.424 --> 01:12:44.326
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT- HAS

01:12:44.393 --> 01:12:46.829
STARTED. THIS LEGISLATION IS

01:12:46.895 --> 01:12:48.497
GOING TO GIVE THE STATE WATER

01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:50.199
BOARD TWO AND A HALF YEARS.

01:12:50.265 --> 01:12:52.367
AFTER THE L. A. PERMAN IS

01:12:52.434 --> 01:12:54.403
ADOPTED TO SEE HOW THE PERMIT IS

01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:55.137
BEING IMPLEMENTED TO SEE ANY

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:57.272
CONCERNS THAT MIGHT BE OCCURRING

01:12:57.339 --> 01:12:58.474
BETWEEN THE COMMERCIAL FACILITY

01:12:58.540 --> 01:12:59.641
IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AT THE

01:12:59.708 --> 01:13:01.143
IRON THOSE OUT FOR STATEWIDE

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:02.945
LEVEL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET

01:13:03.011 --> 01:13:04.279
OUT ALL OF THE PROBLEM AN ISSUE

01:13:04.346 --> 01:13:06.381
AREAS. I DON'T BE CLEAR AT THIS

01:13:06.448 --> 01:13:07.983
LEGISLATION ONLY REQUIRES THE

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:09.918
STATE BOARD TO RELEASE A PUBLIC

01:13:09.985 --> 01:13:11.220
DRAFT BY THE END OF TWENTY

01:13:11.286 --> 01:13:12.688
TWENTY FOUR. AND THAT'S REALLY

01:13:12.755 --> 01:13:14.256
WHEN THE OFFICIAL PUBLIC

01:13:14.323 --> 01:13:17.126
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS BEGINS- AND

01:13:17.192 --> 01:13:18.260
SO WE THINK THERE'S MORE THAN

01:13:18.327 --> 01:13:20.028
ENOUGH TIME. FOR THE STATE TO

01:13:20.095 --> 01:13:22.030
SEE HOW THAT PERMITS WORKING AND

01:13:22.097 --> 01:13:23.899
TO MAKE SURE IT'S WORKABLE FOR

01:13:23.966 --> 01:13:27.069
EVERY REGION- THROUGHOUT THE

01:13:27.136 --> 01:13:28.070
STATE. I ALSO WANTED TO ADDRESS

01:13:28.137 --> 01:13:28.904
WHY STATEWIDE ORDERS IS

01:13:28.971 --> 01:13:31.306
APPROPRIATE INSTEAD NINE

01:13:31.373 --> 01:13:33.275
INDIVIDUAL REGIONAL. PERMITS

01:13:33.342 --> 01:13:34.877
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE

01:13:34.943 --> 01:13:36.612
ON OUR FINGER TIPS THAT. WOULD

01:13:36.678 --> 01:13:38.914
ALLOW US TO PETITION EACH OF THE

01:13:38.981 --> 01:13:41.216
REGIONS TO DO ONE OF THESE.

01:13:41.283 --> 01:13:42.618
PERMITS INDIVIDUALLY. BUT WE

01:13:42.684 --> 01:13:44.153
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE

01:13:44.219 --> 01:13:45.721
COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES TO ONE

01:13:45.788 --> 01:13:47.456
HAVE SOME STATEWIDE CONSISTENCY

01:13:47.523 --> 01:13:48.924
SO THEY SO THEY KNOW WHAT THE

01:13:48.991 --> 01:13:51.360
RULES OF THE GAME ARE. AND TO.

01:13:51.426 --> 01:13:52.694
IF THEY HAVE MULTIPLE PROPERTIES

01:13:52.761 --> 01:13:54.163
THROUGHOUT THE STATE THEY WOULD

01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:55.564
HAVE THE SAME TYPE OF COMPLIANCE

01:13:55.631 --> 01:13:57.065
PATH AND SO THERE WOULD BE A

01:13:57.132 --> 01:13:58.267
CLEAR CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE

01:13:58.333 --> 01:13:59.968
STATE. IT ALSO BE MORE COST

01:14:00.035 --> 01:14:02.538
EFFECTIVE. FOR THE STATE TO DO

01:14:02.604 --> 01:14:03.806
ONE PERMIT. THAT'S GOING TO

01:14:03.872 --> 01:14:05.307
REQUIRE SEQUEL AND THAT THAT

01:14:05.374 --> 01:14:06.909
THAT'S A QUITE A BIG BURDEN ON

01:14:06.975 --> 01:14:08.076
THE STATE WATER BOARD. RATHER

01:14:08.143 --> 01:14:09.745
THAN EACH REGIONAL BOARD DO

01:14:09.812 --> 01:14:11.580
THEIR OWN PERMIT AND THEIR OWN

01:14:11.647 --> 01:14:12.247
SEQUEL PROCESS. WE REALLY FEEL

01:14:12.314 --> 01:14:14.116
LIKE IT PROVIDES A STATE ENOUGH

01:14:14.183 --> 01:14:17.452
TIME- WHILE PROVIDING. A MORE

01:14:17.519 --> 01:14:19.354

BORDER. THE IN THIS IS ONE OF

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:30.204
THE REASONS I THINK YOU SEE SOME

01:28:30.271 --> 01:28:31.139
SUPPORT FROM SOME OF THE

01:28:31.205 --> 01:28:32.106

THERE BUT- IS BASICALLY IT THE

01:28:35.376 --> 01:28:37.178
WE EXPECT THE PERMITS HAVE THREE

01:28:37.245 --> 01:28:38.379
OF THE FLEXIBLE OPTIONS FOR

01:28:38.446 --> 01:28:40.014

01:28:40.081 --> 01:28:42.116
IS WHAT WHAT YOU JUST SAID TO BE

ABLE TO BUILD STORMWATER CAPTURE

01:28:44.218 --> 01:28:45.319
ON THE PROPERTY ITSELF. THE

01:28:45.386 --> 01:28:47.355
OTHER TWO IS EITHER JUST ME-

PROPERTY HAS NO POLLUTION IN IT.

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:53.127
THEN YOU'RE IN COMPLIANCE AND

01:28:53.194 --> 01:28:55.296
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUILD ANYTHING

01:28:55.363 --> 01:28:56.130
IT'S THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE

01:28:56.197 --> 01:28:57.598
OPTIONS. THE LAST. THE LAST

01:28:57.665 --> 01:29:01.636
OPTION WOULD BE- TO. TO PAY INTO

01:29:01.703 --> 01:29:03.371
A DO A COST SHARE WITH THE LOCAL

01:29:03.438 --> 01:29:05.440
GOVERNMENT. AND THEN AGAIN THEY

01:29:05.506 --> 01:29:06.007
WOULD THEY WOULD BUILD THE

01:29:06.074 --> 01:29:08.876
LARGER STORMWATER CAPTURE ON

01:29:08.943 --> 01:29:10.311
MORE CENTRALIZED. TEACHER AND

01:29:10.378 --> 01:29:12.814
THAT THAT'S SAVES A LOT OF COST

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:14.115
BECAUSE IT IT. BASICALLY

01:29:14.182 --> 01:29:15.016
CAPTURES ALL THE SOMEONE TREATS

01:29:15.083 --> 01:29:16.984
ALL SOMEONE FROM EVERYONE UP UP

01:29:17.051 --> 01:29:18.486
IN THE WATERSHED. BECAUSE AT THE

01:29:18.553 --> 01:29:19.821
CONCERT WITH FIG ALRIGHT THE

01:29:19.887 --> 01:29:21.789
SMALL WATER TEST SYSTEM FOR JUST

01:29:21.856 --> 01:29:23.491
SAY THE BLOCK NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:29:23.558 --> 01:29:25.126
WHO'S GOING TO MONITOR TEST THAT

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:26.461
SO THEN IT GOES INTO THE

01:29:26.527 --> 01:29:28.229
STORMWATER SYSTEM L. A. RIVER.

01:29:28.296 --> 01:29:29.764
WHO'S GONNA TESTED THERE AND

01:29:29.831 --> 01:29:31.065
WHO'S GONNA TEST OF JUST BEFORE

01:29:31.132 --> 01:29:32.834
IT HITS THE OCEAN. BECAUSE WE

01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:34.469
KNOW AFTER STORM WATER RAINFALL

01:29:34.535 --> 01:29:36.237
IT COMES SOMETIMES A BEACH IS

01:29:36.304 --> 01:29:37.872
CLOSE FROM ALL OF THAT

01:29:37.939 --> 01:29:39.540
UNDERSTAND TRYING TO KEEP CLEAN

01:29:39.607 --> 01:29:41.109
WATER. BUT HOW MANY BILLIONS OF

01:29:41.175 --> 01:29:42.844
DOLLARS MIGHT BE ADDED TO THIS

01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:45.847
COST THAT'S MY BIGGEST CONCERN

01:29:45.913 --> 01:29:47.348
IN WHO'S GOING TO PAY.

01:29:47.415 --> 01:29:49.183
PARTICULAR INDUSTRY PROTECT

01:29:49.250 --> 01:29:51.252
INDIVIDUALS AND SOME ARE GONNA

01:29:51.319 --> 01:29:54.889
BE ABLE TO AFFORD. IT WOULD LOSE

01:29:54.956 --> 01:30:02.029
MORE BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA.

01:30:02.096 --> 01:30:04.632
GO AHEAD MISS OUR QUE HAN. THANK

01:30:04.699 --> 01:30:06.501
YOU SO I THINK. WHEN I READ THE

01:30:06.567 --> 01:30:08.035
BILL I WAS A LITTLE STUMPED BY

01:30:08.102 --> 01:30:09.203
SORT OF WHAT YOU HIGHLIGHTED

01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:11.005
TODAY WHICH IS THE LACK OF

01:30:11.072 --> 01:30:12.173
CLARITY AND WHAT IT IS WE'RE

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:17.812
ACTUALLY. I HAVE AT THE END.

01:30:17.879 --> 01:30:19.814
THESE NEW STORMWATER PERMITS

01:30:19.881 --> 01:30:21.816
WILL LOOK LIKE WHICH- I'LL BE

01:30:21.883 --> 01:30:24.385
HONEST MAKES ME A LITTLE UNEASY-

01:30:24.452 --> 01:30:27.155
AND SO. I HEAR YOU'RE DOING THAT

01:30:27.221 --> 01:30:28.956
BUT I GUESS PART OF ME THEN

01:30:29.023 --> 01:30:30.925
QUERIES WHETHER. THE TIMING OF

01:30:30.992 --> 01:30:32.627
THIS IS OFFER YOU'RE WAITING

01:30:32.693 --> 01:30:34.095
UNTIL THE L. A. PERMIT COMES OUT

01:30:34.162 --> 01:30:36.063
YOU CAN SEE HOW IT GOES YOU CAN

01:30:36.130 --> 01:30:38.533
LEARN FROM IT THE STATE WATER

01:30:38.599 --> 01:30:39.200
CAN LEARN FROM IT AND THEN THEY

01:30:39.267 --> 01:30:41.235
WILL IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR DO

01:30:41.302 --> 01:30:42.937
THIS. BASED ON THOSE LEARNINGS

01:30:43.004 --> 01:30:43.938
IS WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY AFTER

01:30:44.005 --> 01:30:46.340
THE TIME I CAME FROM. SO I GUESS

01:30:46.407 --> 01:30:48.709
CREE WHY WE'RE DOING THIS BEFORE

01:30:48.776 --> 01:30:49.477
WE SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN LA. WHERE

01:30:49.544 --> 01:30:50.912
WE PRESUPPOSING THAT THIS IS A

01:30:50.978 --> 01:30:52.346
GOOD IDEA NOW RATHER THAN.

01:30:52.413 --> 01:30:53.614
WAITING A YEAR AND SEEING I

01:30:53.681 --> 01:30:55.616
GUESS CAN SOMEBODY ADDRESS THAT

01:30:55.683 --> 01:30:57.218
. WELL I YOU HAVE TO TURN OVER

01:30:57.285 --> 01:30:58.986
SHOT BUT I THINK YOU KNOW THE

01:30:59.053 --> 01:31:00.154
REASON WE'RE DOING THIS IS

01:31:00.221 --> 01:31:01.889
BECAUSE- THIS IS A PROBLEM THE

01:31:01.956 --> 01:31:03.991
BIG PROBLEM AND WE KNOW THAT

01:31:04.058 --> 01:31:05.026
THERE'S BEEN A VERY PUBLIC

01:31:05.092 --> 01:31:06.727
PROCESS IN LA AND THEY'RE ABOUT

01:31:06.794 --> 01:31:10.364
YOU KNOW VERY SOON TO- PPD IN

01:31:10.431 --> 01:31:13.267
THEIR OFFICIAL- MAYO THE RELEASE

01:31:13.334 --> 01:31:15.536
OF- THEIR REGULATION THEY'RE

01:31:15.603 --> 01:31:16.871
PERMITTING PROCESS AND THEY CAN

01:31:16.938 --> 01:31:19.173
BEGIN THAT PUBLIC PROCESS- AND

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:20.441
SO CERTAINLY WE'RE GONNA HAVE A

01:31:20.508 --> 01:31:21.943
LOT OF CLARITY ABOUT WHAT

01:31:22.009 --> 01:31:23.077
THEY'RE GOING TO BE DOING IN A

01:31:23.144 --> 01:31:25.012
MATTER OF DAYS OR WEEKS. OF

01:31:25.079 --> 01:31:27.315
TRYING TO POINT OUT THAT IT

01:31:27.381 --> 01:31:30.117
COULD NOT. ALSO SAKE SO. WE HAVE

01:31:30.184 --> 01:31:31.485
THE EVIDENCE THAT DEMONSTRATES

01:31:31.552 --> 01:31:32.820
THAT THIS POLLUTION IS COMING

01:31:32.887 --> 01:31:34.055
OFF THESE FACILITIES AND UNDER

01:31:34.121 --> 01:31:36.424
THE CLEAN WATER ACT THAT NEEDS

01:31:36.490 --> 01:31:38.492
TO BE ADDRESSED NOW AND TO BE

01:31:38.559 --> 01:31:39.360
PERFECTLY HONEST I HAD THE

01:31:39.427 --> 01:31:41.162
OPTION OF WE COULD WIN TEACH

01:31:41.229 --> 01:31:42.196
REGIONAL BOARD AND PETITION EACH

01:31:42.263 --> 01:31:43.831
OF THEM OR WE THOUGHT THIS WAS

01:31:43.898 --> 01:31:45.433
THE MORE KIND COST EFFECTIVE WAY

01:31:45.499 --> 01:31:47.201
TO DO IT IN MORE RESPONSIBLE WAY

01:31:47.268 --> 01:31:48.903
TO DO IT BECAUSE WE BUILD OUT

01:31:48.970 --> 01:31:51.539
THE TIME FOR IT. AND SO THE LA

01:31:51.606 --> 01:31:53.140
ONE IS GOING TO BE ADOPTED IN

01:31:53.207 --> 01:31:54.475
SEPTEMBER AND WE KNOW WHAT'S IN

01:31:54.542 --> 01:31:55.810
IT IT HASN'T HIT THE STREET YET

01:31:55.877 --> 01:31:57.945
BUT I KNOW WHAT'S IN THE ORDER I

01:31:58.012 --> 01:31:59.046
THINK THIS SORT OF PROPERTIES

01:31:59.113 --> 01:32:00.314
UNDERSTAND THEY'VE ALREADY HAD

01:32:00.381 --> 01:32:02.216
CYCLE TO MAKE SO WE KNOW WHAT'S

01:32:02.283 --> 01:32:04.118
GOING TO BE IN THERE AND I THINK

01:32:04.185 --> 01:32:06.187
THE IDEA IS RIGHT NOW IN THIS

01:32:06.254 --> 01:32:07.388
THIS GETS TO THE OTHER POINT

01:32:07.455 --> 01:32:08.456
MADE. RIGHT NOW THE

01:32:08.522 --> 01:32:09.390
MUNICIPALITIES AND LOCAL

01:32:09.457 --> 01:32:11.092
GOVERNMENTS THEY'RE THE ONES ON

01:32:11.158 --> 01:32:12.260
THE HOOK THEY'RE THE ONES RIGHT

01:32:12.326 --> 01:32:13.527
NOW THAT ARE INCURRING THE

01:32:13.594 --> 01:32:14.762
LIABILITY COSTS FROM THIS RUNOFF

01:32:14.829 --> 01:32:16.063
IT'S GOING INTO THEIR M. S. FOR

01:32:16.130 --> 01:32:18.199
THEIR THE ONES THAT HAVE THE

01:32:18.266 --> 01:32:19.100
MONITOR FOR IT AND NOW THEY'RE

01:32:19.166 --> 01:32:21.269
THE ONES RIGHT NOW THAT ARE IN

01:32:21.335 --> 01:32:23.170
CHARGE OF IT IT'S A REALLY WE

01:32:23.237 --> 01:32:24.906
SEE THIS AS- A LEVEL THE PLAYING

01:32:24.972 --> 01:32:26.407
FIELD SO THAT EVERYONE IS

01:32:26.474 --> 01:32:27.642
EQUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR

01:32:27.708 --> 01:32:28.442
CONTRIBUTION OF THIS THE STORM

01:32:28.509 --> 01:32:31.078
WATER RUNOFF. AND YET WE BUILT

01:32:31.145 --> 01:32:32.914
OUT TIME TO TWENTY TWENTY FOUR

01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:34.515
TO ANYTHING HAS TO HIT THE

01:32:34.582 --> 01:32:36.083
STREETS FOR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT

01:32:36.150 --> 01:32:37.151
BUT THE STATE BOARD'S GONNA

01:32:37.218 --> 01:32:38.586
START WORKING ON THIS A MEDIALLY

01:32:38.653 --> 01:32:40.554
ENDED IN FACT WHEN WE TALK TO

01:32:40.621 --> 01:32:42.256
THEM THEY ONLY WANTED US TO

01:32:42.323 --> 01:32:43.891
REALLY WAIT UNTIL THE YOU KNOW

01:32:43.958 --> 01:32:45.059
TO SEE HOW THE PUBLIC COMMENT

01:32:45.126 --> 01:32:46.994
CAME OUT AND HOW THE REVISED

01:32:47.061 --> 01:32:49.063
THAT JUST LA PERMIT FORGET THE

01:32:49.130 --> 01:32:50.264
PART ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION

01:32:50.331 --> 01:32:52.033
THEY JUST WANT TO SEE WHAT KIND

01:32:52.099 --> 01:32:52.967
OF ISSUES GOT REYES. AND SO WE

01:32:53.034 --> 01:32:54.869
BUILT IN EXTRA TIME JUST AND

01:32:54.936 --> 01:32:56.871
REALLY I THINK WHAT IT COMES

01:32:56.938 --> 01:32:57.939
DOWN TO IS THIS UNIQUE FEATURE

01:32:58.005 --> 01:32:59.874
THE ALTERNATE COMPLIANCE PATH OF

01:32:59.941 --> 01:33:02.076
THE FACILITY BEING ABLE TO PAY-

01:33:02.143 --> 01:33:03.844
THE WITH THE MUNICIPALITY TO DO

01:33:03.911 --> 01:33:05.546
A CARSHARE PROGRAM THAT'S REALLY

01:33:05.613 --> 01:33:06.781
NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE SO THAT'S

01:33:06.847 --> 01:33:09.283
KIND OF THE PART TO BE WORKED

01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:11.619
OUT BUT NO ONE IS FORCING THE

01:33:11.686 --> 01:33:12.787
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO HAVE TO DO

01:33:12.853 --> 01:33:14.488
THOSE AGREEMENTS AND I THINK TWO

01:33:14.555 --> 01:33:16.757
AND A HALF YEARS TO CUT HIGHER

01:33:16.824 --> 01:33:17.992
NOT HOW DOES AND WILL USE WILL

01:33:18.059 --> 01:33:19.293
WORK. IT IS SUFFICIENT TIME TO

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:24.799
BE ABLE TO DO THAT- AND IF IT'S

01:33:24.865 --> 01:33:26.100
NOT. THE STATE BORDER TAKE LONG.

01:33:26.167 --> 01:33:27.101
BEFORE SOME. AND ALL. KNOWN

01:33:27.168 --> 01:33:28.803
LOCAL. IS BEING REQUIRED TO DO.

01:33:28.869 --> 01:33:30.805
OF THE ANY OF THIS KIND OF CAR

01:33:30.871 --> 01:33:32.006
SHARING AGREEMENT WITH THEM IT'S

01:33:32.073 --> 01:33:33.174
JUST THAT. ONE OF THE OPTIONS

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:34.408
AVAILABLE. AND AGAIN

01:33:34.475 --> 01:33:35.076
MUNICIPALITIES. HAVE TO DO THIS

01:33:35.142 --> 01:33:37.244
ANYWAY. SO IT CAN I JUST AND

01:33:37.311 --> 01:33:39.013
MAYBE USE THAT AS MY APOLOGIZE

01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:39.981
IN ADVANCE IF YOU DID SO

01:33:40.047 --> 01:33:41.849
REGIONAL. REGIONAL BOARDS COPIES

01:33:41.916 --> 01:33:43.284
TO DO THIS ALREADY CAN THE STATE

01:33:43.351 --> 01:33:45.152
BOARD DO A STATEWIDE PERMIT NOW.

01:33:45.219 --> 01:33:46.153
OR WE ENABLING THEM TO DO

01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:47.388
SOMETHING THEY DON'T HAVE THE

01:33:47.455 --> 01:33:48.789
AUTHORITY TO DO. THEY CAN. THEY

01:33:48.856 --> 01:33:51.759
CAN DO IT NOW IF THEY IF THEY

01:33:51.826 --> 01:33:53.995
WANTED TO YES. OKAY SO. WHAT

01:33:54.061 --> 01:33:55.329
HAVE THEY WAIT AND DO THEY WANT

01:33:55.396 --> 01:33:57.164
TO DO IS STATEWIDE AND I ALSO

01:33:57.231 --> 01:33:58.399
THINK ABOUT THE STATE OF

01:33:58.466 --> 01:34:00.501
CALIFORNIA. AND I WANT TO I

01:34:00.568 --> 01:34:01.135
ACTUALLY SHOULD HAVE STARTED BY

01:34:01.202 --> 01:34:03.004
SAYING. HOW GRATEFUL I AM TO.

01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:04.839
HAVE A RIVAS FOR HIS DEDICATION.

01:34:04.905 --> 01:34:06.407
TO STORMWATER RUNOFF IT IS AS HE

01:34:06.474 --> 01:34:09.310
POINTED OUT. A REALLY BIG ISSUE-

01:34:09.377 --> 01:34:10.044
AND ONE THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:34:10.111 --> 01:34:11.846
ADDRESSING I JUST WANNA MAKE

01:34:11.912 --> 01:34:13.781
SURE WE'RE DOING IT IN THE

01:34:13.848 --> 01:34:15.549
SMARTEST WAY. AND GIVEN SORT OF

01:34:15.616 --> 01:34:17.618
WHAT I FOUND TO BE A LITTLE BIT

01:34:17.685 --> 01:34:19.153
OF THE- VACANT H. OR- OF THE

01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:20.921
BILL AS IT STANDS TODAY. I JUST

01:34:20.988 --> 01:34:23.324
HAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS SO CAN

01:34:23.391 --> 01:34:25.926
YOU AS A THIRD. YEAH AND I CAN

01:34:25.993 --> 01:34:27.294
JUST THE VAGUE NATURE OF IT. WE

01:34:27.361 --> 01:34:29.330
DID THAT ON PURPOSE ALMOST AS A

01:34:29.397 --> 01:34:30.798
COMMITMENT TO SOME OF THE- THE-

01:34:30.865 --> 01:34:32.199
THE PROPERTIES AND THE FOLKS

01:34:32.266 --> 01:34:33.367
THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO ON

01:34:33.434 --> 01:34:34.535
STORMWATER STUFF BECAUSE- IN

01:34:34.602 --> 01:34:36.103
FACT WE TOOK AMENDMENTS. ALSO

01:34:36.170 --> 01:34:36.904
TALKING TO CALCHAMBER. BECAUSE

01:34:36.971 --> 01:34:38.406
NO ONE WANTED. OUR BILL LANGUAGE

01:34:38.472 --> 01:34:40.941
TIED SPECIFICALLY TO THE L. A.

01:34:41.008 --> 01:34:42.943
PERMIT WE TOOK THAT OUT. BECAUSE

01:34:43.010 --> 01:34:44.845
OF THE OTHER FOLKS ASK FOR THAT-

01:34:44.912 --> 01:34:47.181
AND SO THAT'S WHY WE TRY TO KEEP

01:34:47.248 --> 01:34:48.983
A HIGH LEVEL. I ALSO JUST WANTED

01:34:49.050 --> 01:34:49.984
TO BE RESPECTFUL. LAST YEAR WHEN

01:34:50.051 --> 01:34:51.752
WE ARE IN THIS COMMITTEE OF THE

01:34:51.819 --> 01:34:53.087
KNOT TYING THE BOARD'S HANDS

01:34:53.154 --> 01:34:54.021
GIVING THEM ALL THEIR

01:34:54.088 --> 01:34:55.589
DISCRETION. SO THAT THEY CAN

01:34:55.656 --> 01:34:56.924
DEFINE. I KNOW ONE OF THE ISSUES

01:34:56.991 --> 01:34:59.193
WAS HOW LARGE OF A FACILITIES IS

01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:00.027
GOING TO COVER. AND JUST SO

01:35:00.094 --> 01:35:02.029
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT RIGHT NOW IN

01:35:02.096 --> 01:35:03.798
THE LA PERMITS THEY'RE PROPOSING

01:35:03.864 --> 01:35:06.467
A FIVE ACRES WHICH IS A FAIRLY

01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:09.036
LARGE FOR. OF PARKING. THOSE ARE

01:35:09.103 --> 01:35:10.371
THE TYPE OF DISCUSSION THAT I

01:35:10.438 --> 01:35:12.206
DON'T WANT TO. SELF IMPOSE INTEL

01:35:12.273 --> 01:35:14.108
THE WATER BOARD WHAT TO DO SO

01:35:14.175 --> 01:35:15.709
THAT'S WHY WE LEFT IT. OPEN BUT

01:35:15.776 --> 01:35:17.945

EXACTLY WHAT IT IS I'M FINE WITH

01:35:20.948 --> 01:35:22.450
THAT WE WERE TRYING TO.

01:35:22.516 --> 01:35:24.952
COMPROMISE WITH THAT THE FOR THE

01:35:25.019 --> 01:35:27.588
FOLKS- AND THEN THE WATER BOARD.

01:35:27.655 --> 01:35:28.989
WHAT IS. THIS OKAY WHATEVER YOU

01:35:29.056 --> 01:35:30.257
MAKE SURE YOU'RE SPEAKING INTO

01:35:30.324 --> 01:35:32.359
THE MICROPHONE. SO ASK THE STATE

01:35:32.426 --> 01:35:34.195
WATER WHAT HAVE THEY WEIGHED IN

01:35:34.261 --> 01:35:35.896
ON THIS AND THINK IF THEY ARE

01:35:35.963 --> 01:35:37.098
YOU HAVE A STORY BUT DON'T

01:35:37.164 --> 01:35:39.033
APPEAR TO BE RIGHT. ACCENTING RV

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:39.934
CAGES ANSWER QUESTION WE ARE

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.302
SCHEDULED TO ENGAGE WITH WATER

01:35:41.368 --> 01:35:43.104
BOARD BUT LATER THIS WEEK OKAY.

01:35:43.170 --> 01:35:44.371
THANK YOU ALL THREE PIECES OF

01:35:44.438 --> 01:35:46.373
LEGISLATION OKAY. AND SO I DON'T

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:47.208
WANNA SPEAK FOR THEM BUT THEY

01:35:47.274 --> 01:35:48.742
HAVE BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN THE

01:35:48.809 --> 01:35:51.378
L. A. ORDER. AND I THINK THEY'RE

01:35:51.445 --> 01:35:52.046
EXCITED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL THAT

01:35:52.113 --> 01:35:52.880
IT HAS. BECAUSE AGAIN IT.

01:35:52.947 --> 01:35:54.081
REGULATE SOMETHING THAT'S

01:35:54.148 --> 01:35:55.182
CURRENTLY ON REGULATED. THAT'S

01:35:55.249 --> 01:35:55.950
NOW THE MUNICIPALITIES

01:35:56.016 --> 01:35:59.787
LIABILITY. AND IT CREATES THESE

01:35:59.854 --> 01:36:00.921
ALL THESE. FLEXIBLE OPTIONS THAT

01:36:00.988 --> 01:36:02.289
WE REALLY DIDN'T HAVE AN PERMITS

01:36:02.356 --> 01:36:03.624
BEFORE AND THEY'RE EXCITED

01:36:03.691 --> 01:36:05.025
ABOUT. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IN

01:36:05.092 --> 01:36:06.260
THIS BILL MODERNIZING STORMWATER

01:36:06.327 --> 01:36:07.995
IS BASE SEE THIS IS THE WAVE OF

01:36:08.062 --> 01:36:09.930
THE FUTURE. AND SO I THINK THEY

01:36:09.997 --> 01:36:11.765
ARE EXCITED ABOUT IT NOT IN AN

01:36:11.832 --> 01:36:13.000
OFFICIAL POSITION ONE BECAUSE WE

01:36:13.067 --> 01:36:13.968
HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO THEM

01:36:14.034 --> 01:36:15.503
OFFICIALLY YET. BUT FROM TALKS

01:36:15.569 --> 01:36:17.104
WITH THEM LEADING UP TO THIS I

01:36:17.171 --> 01:36:19.006
THINK. THEY LIKE THE CONCEPT OF

01:36:19.073 --> 01:36:21.542
THE GOING FORTH. GOT IT I'M- SO

01:36:21.609 --> 01:36:25.880
I MEAN. AGAIN I THINK YOU KNOW.

01:36:25.946 --> 01:36:27.248
I GUESS THE QUESTION BEFORE US

01:36:27.314 --> 01:36:29.416
IS DO WE FORCE THE STATE WATER

01:36:29.483 --> 01:36:31.252
BOARD TO DO THE STATEWIDE PERMIT

01:36:31.318 --> 01:36:32.386
GIVEN THEY ALREADY HAVE THE

01:36:32.453 --> 01:36:33.721
AUTHORITY TO DO IT- BECAUSE WE

01:36:33.787 --> 01:36:35.089
THINK SO I GUESS WE'RE MAKING

01:36:35.156 --> 01:36:36.457
THE DECISION WE THINK STATEWIDE

01:36:36.524 --> 01:36:37.858
IS BETTER THAN A REGIONAL

01:36:37.925 --> 01:36:39.860
APPROACH RIGHT I MEAN I GUESS

01:36:39.927 --> 01:36:40.461
THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING. IS

01:36:40.528 --> 01:36:41.862
REALLY THE QUESTION BEFORE US

01:36:41.929 --> 01:36:43.297
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE CAN SAY

01:36:43.364 --> 01:36:44.999
IT'S GOING TO BE A FIVE ACRE

01:36:45.065 --> 01:36:47.201
PERMIT IT'S GOING TO BE HOW

01:36:47.268 --> 01:36:48.602
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR

01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:50.104
IT AND WE HAVE NONE OF THOSE

01:36:50.171 --> 01:36:51.972
DETAILS. IN THE LANGUAGE WE ARE

01:36:52.039 --> 01:36:53.107
MERELY. ASKING THE STATE BOARD.

01:36:53.174 --> 01:36:54.808
TO DO A STATEWIDE PERMIT AGAIN

01:36:54.875 --> 01:36:56.477
WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE LA. ORDER

01:36:56.544 --> 01:36:57.978
SO WE DON'T EVEN HAVE THE BASIS

01:36:58.045 --> 01:37:00.748
ON WHICH THEY'RE DOING THAT. SO

01:37:00.814 --> 01:37:03.417
THAT'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS I'M-

01:37:03.484 --> 01:37:05.186
AND NOT A LOT OF ANSWERS AND SO

01:37:05.252 --> 01:37:07.288
I GUESS MY- I MEAN I GUESS MY

01:37:07.354 --> 01:37:09.290
REAL GOT HERE IS SAYING YOU KNOW

01:37:09.356 --> 01:37:11.158
THIS ISN'T THE MOMENT FOR THIS

01:37:11.225 --> 01:37:11.992
EVEN IF THIS IS THE ULTIMATE

01:37:12.059 --> 01:37:13.928
THING WE SHOULD DO- OF THE

01:37:13.994 --> 01:37:15.362
TIMING IS REALLY THE QUESTION.

01:37:15.429 --> 01:37:17.064
THAT I HAVE BEFORE ME AND- I

01:37:17.131 --> 01:37:18.799
GUESS AND YOU DECIDE BUT I WILL

01:37:18.866 --> 01:37:20.768
SAY THAT I DO REALLY APPRECIATE

01:37:20.834 --> 01:37:22.536
THE PEACE OF THE BILL THAT

01:37:22.603 --> 01:37:23.704
MODERNIZES THE DATABASE I THINK

01:37:23.771 --> 01:37:25.072
WE DO A HORRIBLE JOB OF THE

01:37:25.139 --> 01:37:26.574
GOVERNMENT ON DATA. INSTEAD IT

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:27.775
LEADS TO- IN ACTION AND- THE

01:37:27.841 --> 01:37:30.244
FAILURE TO REALLY- BE SMART

01:37:30.311 --> 01:37:31.345
ABOUT OUR MANAGEMENT PRACTICES

01:37:31.412 --> 01:37:33.414
AND SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:34.915
YOUR FOCUS ON THE STREET. YEAH I

01:37:34.982 --> 01:37:36.784
KNOW I APPRECIATE- THOSE

01:37:36.850 --> 01:37:41.021
COMMENTS AND I THINK WHEN YOU-

01:37:41.088 --> 01:37:42.856
ASSESS THIS PROBLEM HOW SOME

01:37:42.923 --> 01:37:44.158
COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY THOSE OF

01:37:44.225 --> 01:37:46.060
COLOR ARE IMPACTED MORE SO HAN

01:37:46.126 --> 01:37:48.562
OTHERS I THINK CREATING A

01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:49.530
STATEWIDE- CONSISTENCY WHEN

01:37:49.597 --> 01:37:50.464
COMES ISSUES INCREDIBLY

01:37:50.531 --> 01:37:52.199
IMPORTANT RATHER THAN TO HAVE

01:37:52.266 --> 01:37:58.539
THIS PATCHWORK OF- OF- YOU KNOW

01:37:58.606 --> 01:38:01.175

OCCUR WITH- YOU KNOW ALL THE ALL

01:38:08.515 --> 01:38:09.550
THE DIFFERENT BY MAIL IMPACTS

01:38:09.617 --> 01:38:11.885
AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING IN ME

01:38:11.952 --> 01:38:13.187
TIMELY STONE. IF YOU DON'T TAKE

01:38:13.254 --> 01:38:15.623
A LOT OF TIMES OF HAVING A-

01:38:15.689 --> 01:38:19.927
STATEWIDE- PROCESS IS IMPORTANT.

01:38:19.994 --> 01:38:21.695
ESPECIALLY FOR STATE LIKE OURS.

01:38:21.762 --> 01:38:24.698

A COUPLE COMMENTS ON THIS BILL-

01:38:32.473 --> 01:38:33.941
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE L. A.

01:38:34.008 --> 01:38:35.409
RIVER AND THE THING GABLE RIVER

01:38:35.476 --> 01:38:38.212
WHICH IS THE OTHER MAJOR- FLOOD

01:38:38.279 --> 01:38:39.847
CHANNEL STORMWATER. IN SOUTHERN

COMMUNITY AND FOR FIFTY YEARS-

01:38:49.356 --> 01:38:51.425
THE COMMUNITY THAT THE- CURRENT

01:38:51.492 --> 01:38:53.827
LAWS HAVE BEEN WORK FOR US-

01:38:53.894 --> 01:38:55.829
IT'S- A BASE AND THAT'S FULL OF

01:38:55.896 --> 01:38:58.866
COPPER KDM SEEING LET OIL-

ANY GIVEN DAY OF THE WEEK IS THE

01:39:02.469 --> 01:39:04.204
REALITY THAT WE LIVE IN AND SO

01:39:04.271 --> 01:39:05.439
THE CURRENT LAW HASN'T WORKED

01:39:05.506 --> 01:39:07.074
UNTIL WE DO NEED A STATE WHERE

01:39:07.141 --> 01:39:09.243
I'VE HAD TO MAKE SURE THESE

01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:09.943
COMMUNITIES THAT. CONTINUE TO BE

01:39:10.010 --> 01:39:11.779
LEFT BEHIND ARE NO LONGER LEFT

01:39:11.845 --> 01:39:12.613

THERE'S A LOT OF DETAILS I STILL

01:39:15.316 --> 01:39:17.151
NEED TO BE WORKED OUT. BUT WE'RE

01:39:17.217 --> 01:39:18.252

IMPLEMENT- THINGS ALONG THE WAY

01:39:37.271 --> 01:39:39.340

CITIES IN OPPOSITION TO THIS

01:40:52.613 --> 01:40:55.783

STORM WATER. WHAT KIND OF THINGS

01:41:46.133 --> 01:41:50.671
OKAY. GREAT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT

01:41:50.737 --> 01:41:54.808
AFTER I HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS-

01:41:54.875 --> 01:41:57.377
FOR OF ALL EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO

01:41:57.444 --> 01:41:58.479
WHEN I STARTED ON CITY COUNCIL

01:41:58.545 --> 01:41:59.813
THEY SAID YOU KNOW THERE'S THIS

01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:01.982
STORM WATER MANDATE. AND THE WAY

01:42:02.049 --> 01:42:03.250
IT LOOKS IS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:42:03.317 --> 01:42:05.319
TO BUILD A SECOND- WATER

01:42:05.385 --> 01:42:07.321
PURIFICATION SYSTEM JUST TO DEAL

01:42:07.387 --> 01:42:09.890
WITH STORMWATER. WHICH IS A FEW

01:42:09.957 --> 01:42:13.861
BILLION DOLLARS- SO. MAYBE IT'S

01:42:13.927 --> 01:42:15.395
JUST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS BUT IT

01:42:15.462 --> 01:42:17.531
WAS MORE THAN THE CITY FELL TO

01:42:17.598 --> 01:42:20.300
COULD AFFORD- AND NO WAY TO

01:42:20.367 --> 01:42:22.236
FINANCE IT SO THIS IS A WAY TO

01:42:22.302 --> 01:42:24.037
FINANCE BUT- I'M TRYING TO

01:42:24.104 --> 01:42:27.441
VISUALIZE SO YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT

01:42:27.508 --> 01:42:29.476
WHAT THE L. A. SIS THE L. A-

01:42:29.543 --> 01:42:30.978
ROSS THIS IS BUT IT'S ONLY FOR A

01:42:31.044 --> 01:42:32.980
SMALL PART OF THE CITY RIGHT

01:42:33.046 --> 01:42:34.848
JUST A PARTICULAR. A DRAINAGE

01:42:34.915 --> 01:42:37.618
BASIN CORRECT IT'S EL CERRITO

01:42:37.684 --> 01:42:39.853
SPENT AND BIGGEST CHANNEL. OKAY

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:43.423
SO IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THE

01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:46.627
WHOLE OF L. A. COUNTY. NOT

01:42:46.693 --> 01:42:48.829
CURRENTLY NO SO THE COURT CASE

01:42:48.896 --> 01:42:50.831
THAT- REQUIRED THEM TO GO

01:42:50.898 --> 01:42:52.666
FORWARD WITH THAT REQUIRED THE

01:42:52.733 --> 01:42:54.434
EPA TO GO FORWARD WITH IT. ON

01:42:54.501 --> 01:42:56.036
HOW MUCH I CAN DISCUSS AND- BUT-

01:42:56.103 --> 01:42:58.038
THE EPA WANTED TO JUST DO WHAT

01:42:58.105 --> 01:43:00.073
THE COURT SAID TO DO- AND NOT

01:43:00.140 --> 01:43:01.241
SPEAKING FOR THE WATER BOARDS

01:43:01.308 --> 01:43:02.876
BUT I THINK THEY WERE THINKING

01:43:02.943 --> 01:43:04.711
WELL THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY

01:43:04.778 --> 01:43:06.647
TO DO IT MORE BROADLY THAN JUST

01:43:06.713 --> 01:43:09.316
THAT WHAT THE COURT SAID SO ARE

01:43:09.383 --> 01:43:11.018
YOU ENVISIONING THAT. SOMETIME

01:43:11.084 --> 01:43:14.121
IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY

01:43:14.187 --> 01:43:15.689
TWENTY FIVE. EVERY PARKING LOT

01:43:15.756 --> 01:43:17.257
GREATER THAN FIVE ACRES WOULD

01:43:17.324 --> 01:43:19.526
HAVE TO START PAYING INTO A FUND

01:43:19.593 --> 01:43:21.595
OR COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF.

01:43:21.662 --> 01:43:25.232
MITIGATION EVERYONE IN THE STATE

01:43:25.299 --> 01:43:26.767
. SO COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES THAT

01:43:26.833 --> 01:43:28.702
ARE FIVE ACRES OR MORE SO THE

01:43:28.769 --> 01:43:30.237
WAY THE CLEAN WATER ACT WORKS

01:43:30.304 --> 01:43:32.673
THERE NEEDS TO BE A NEXUS

01:43:32.739 --> 01:43:34.274
BETWEEN THE FACILITY AND CAUSING

01:43:34.341 --> 01:43:37.077
A SIGNIFICANT- CONTRIBUTION OF

01:43:37.144 --> 01:43:39.846
POLLUTION INTO. A WATERWAY AND

01:43:39.913 --> 01:43:41.882
SO WHERE THERE IS THE EVIDENCE

01:43:41.949 --> 01:43:44.151
FOR THAT THAT IS WHERE THE STATE

01:43:44.217 --> 01:43:45.352
WATER BOARD USING THEIR

01:43:45.419 --> 01:43:46.720
DISCRETION WOULD. THIS WOULD BE-

01:43:46.787 --> 01:43:50.857
BASICALLY TAKEN ALL OF L. A.

01:43:50.924 --> 01:43:52.392
COUNTY YEP ALL OF EVERY COUNTY.

01:43:52.459 --> 01:43:54.161
THE OTHER WORDS- EVERY COUNTY

01:43:54.227 --> 01:43:55.629
THAT HAS A PARKING LOT GREATER

01:43:55.696 --> 01:43:58.231
THAN FIVE ACRES WHICH IS

01:43:58.298 --> 01:44:00.767
CERTAINLY ALL OF THE- URBAN

01:44:00.834 --> 01:44:04.271
COUNTIES IN SUBURBAN COUNTIES-

01:44:04.338 --> 01:44:06.340
YOU KNOW MAYBE THAT ALPINE BUT

01:44:06.406 --> 01:44:08.842
JUST ABOUT EVERYWHERE ELSE. SO

01:44:08.909 --> 01:44:10.811
IT'S FACILITY THE FACILITY AND

01:44:10.877 --> 01:44:12.512
SO NOT A GRAND TOTAL OF FIVE

01:44:12.579 --> 01:44:14.081
ACRES FOR THAT COUNTY BECAUSE

01:44:14.147 --> 01:44:15.449
IT'S NOT THE COUNTY THAT'S GOING

01:44:15.515 --> 01:44:17.517
TO BE UNDER THE PERMIT IT'S THE

01:44:17.584 --> 01:44:18.318
INDIVIDUAL INDIVIDUAL COMMERCIAL

01:44:18.385 --> 01:44:20.520
FOR SORT OF WHAT I'M SAYING IS

01:44:20.587 --> 01:44:22.389
YOU'RE ANTICIPATING A BIG BAG.

01:44:22.456 --> 01:44:24.858
EVERYBODY IN THE STATE IT'S

01:44:24.925 --> 01:44:26.593
CERTAINLY GOING TO HAVE TO

01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:27.961
RESPOND TO THIS ANYONE WHO IS

01:44:28.028 --> 01:44:30.230
UNDER IT IS THAT CORRECT OR CAN

01:44:30.297 --> 01:44:32.165
THE WATER BOARD SAY WELL WILL

01:44:32.232 --> 01:44:34.167
CONCENTRATE ON THIS FIRST- THAT

01:44:34.234 --> 01:44:37.804
FIRST OR- WHAT WHAT'S GOING ON.

01:44:37.871 --> 01:44:40.207
I TO VISUALIZE IT THE FOR THE

01:44:40.273 --> 01:44:41.274
REASON WE GAVE THE STATE BOARD

01:44:41.341 --> 01:44:42.776
DISCUSSION IS SO THAT THEY CAN

01:44:42.843 --> 01:44:43.877
DECIDE WHAT'S THE MOST

01:44:43.944 --> 01:44:45.045
APPROPRIATE IF THERE IS A LARGE

01:44:45.112 --> 01:44:47.047
GROUP OF FOLKS THAT ARE THE MOST

01:44:47.114 --> 01:44:48.048
SIGNIFICANT FOLKS THAN THEY CAN

01:44:48.115 --> 01:44:50.083
DIVIDE THE FIND THE PERMIT TO.

01:44:50.150 --> 01:44:50.951
OR THEY COULD DO A TIERED

01:44:51.018 --> 01:44:53.453
APPROACH AND GET THE LARGEST

01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:54.121
POLLUTERS IN THE GREATEST

01:44:54.187 --> 01:44:55.355
FACILITIES FIRST AND THEN AND

01:44:55.422 --> 01:44:57.257
TEAR IT UP- IT'S REALLY UP TO

01:44:57.324 --> 01:44:59.026
SUPPORT THEY COULD GO THROUGH IT

01:44:59.092 --> 01:45:00.260
YOU KNOW THIS IS A CRITICAL

01:45:00.327 --> 01:45:02.863
DATA. DRAINAGE BASIN SO WILL DO

01:45:02.929 --> 01:45:05.532
THIS ONE FIRST. THEY CAN DO THAT

01:45:05.599 --> 01:45:07.434
CORRECT OKAY SO THEY'RE NOT

01:45:07.501 --> 01:45:09.736
GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO SAY

01:45:09.803 --> 01:45:12.539
EVERY FACILITY IN THE STATE. HAS

01:45:12.606 --> 01:45:18.879
TO SUDDENLY HE- DO SOMETHING.

01:45:18.945 --> 01:45:21.214
WELL IT'S A STATE WIDE PERMIT

01:45:21.281 --> 01:45:22.349
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO ASK IT

01:45:22.416 --> 01:45:24.384
FROM EVERYONE. THE STATEWIDE

01:45:24.451 --> 01:45:27.120
PERMIT FORM. WHAT DATE THEY

01:45:27.187 --> 01:45:29.222
COULD CONCENTRATE ON PARTICULAR

01:45:29.289 --> 01:45:30.824
DRAINAGE BASINS WHICH WOULDN'T

01:45:30.891 --> 01:45:32.025
SURPRISE ME THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE

01:45:32.092 --> 01:45:33.994
DOING IN LA CORRECT AND I MEAN

01:45:34.061 --> 01:45:36.296
AND THAT'S WHY WE TRY TO KEEP IT

01:45:36.363 --> 01:45:37.064
HIGH LEVEL IN KNOTS TIED THE

01:45:37.130 --> 01:45:39.099
WATER BOARD'S HAND WE WANTED

01:45:39.166 --> 01:45:40.667
THEM TO DISCUSSION TO HAVE THAT

01:45:40.734 --> 01:45:42.536
FLEXIBILITY. SO WHAT ADDITIONAL

01:45:42.602 --> 01:45:44.504
SO IF THIS BILL PASSES WHAT

01:45:44.571 --> 01:45:49.576
ADDITIONAL. EITHER POWER OR- A

01:45:49.643 --> 01:45:51.978
REQUIREMENT GOES ON TO THE WATER

01:45:52.045 --> 01:45:53.046
BOARD ARE THESE THINGS THAT THEY

01:45:53.113 --> 01:45:55.015
COULDN'T DO WITHOUT THIS BILL OR

01:45:55.082 --> 01:45:56.149
THE FACING THINGS THAT THEY'RE

01:45:56.216 --> 01:45:59.119
GOING TO BE FORCED TO DO WITH

01:45:59.186 --> 01:46:02.189
THIS BILL. SO THEY HAVE THE

01:46:02.255 --> 01:46:03.623
WATER BOARD HAVE THE AUTHORITY

01:46:03.690 --> 01:46:05.258
UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT THAT

01:46:05.325 --> 01:46:06.960
IF THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT

01:46:07.027 --> 01:46:08.595
THERE'S A SET THAT UP FACILITY

01:46:08.662 --> 01:46:09.763
CAUSES A SIGNIFICANT

01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:11.631
CONTRIBUTION OF POLLUTION. THE

01:46:11.698 --> 01:46:13.900
COURT NOW SAYS THEY HAVE TO BE

01:46:13.967 --> 01:46:15.335
ADDRESSED THROUGH A PERMIT AND

01:46:15.402 --> 01:46:17.471
THAT'S THE SECTIONS WE REFERENCE

01:46:17.537 --> 01:46:19.506
IN THE LEGISLATION. AND FROM

01:46:19.573 --> 01:46:21.942
THERE THE- THAT'S ESSENTIALLY IT

01:46:22.008 --> 01:46:22.876
IN THE STATE WOULD CREATE THE

01:46:22.943 --> 01:46:26.713
PERMIT- THE AND THE PERMIT WOULD

01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:28.248
LIKELY HAVE. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:46:28.315 --> 01:46:30.250
MONITORING THAT WOULD ONLY OCCUR

01:46:30.317 --> 01:46:31.084
IF THEY PICK THE ONE OPTION OF

01:46:31.151 --> 01:46:32.619
COMPYING WITH THEIR WATER

01:46:32.686 --> 01:46:35.088
QUALITY STANDARDS ON SITE- IT

01:46:35.155 --> 01:46:37.057
JUST DEPENDS ON HOW THEY-

01:46:37.124 --> 01:46:38.391
DETERMINE THE PERMIT BUT THE

01:46:38.458 --> 01:46:39.559
WATER BOARD'S THEMSELVES

01:46:39.626 --> 01:46:40.660
WOULDN'T BE RESTRICTED IN ANY

01:46:40.727 --> 01:46:42.229
WAY. YOU KNOW THERE ARE FORTY

01:46:42.295 --> 01:46:43.630
DOESN'T CHANGE IN ANY WAY THIS

01:46:43.697 --> 01:46:45.298
REALLY IS TRYING TO SET A

01:46:45.365 --> 01:46:47.167
PRIORITY OF. THESE ARE VERY

01:46:47.234 --> 01:46:50.237
LARGE CONTRIBUTING- STORMWATER

01:46:50.303 --> 01:46:52.239
POLLUTANT POLLUTERS AND YET

01:46:52.305 --> 01:46:53.673
RIGHT NOW THERE UNADDRESSED AND

01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:54.207
SO REALLY IT'S SETTING A

01:46:54.274 --> 01:46:55.942
PRIORITY FOR THE STATE WATER

01:46:56.009 --> 01:46:57.043
BOARD TO ADDRESS THAT OF THE

01:46:57.110 --> 01:46:59.246
STATE WATER BOARD NOW HAS THE

01:46:59.312 --> 01:47:02.282
AUTHORITY TO DO THIS. AND YOU'RE

01:47:02.349 --> 01:47:04.117
GOING TO REQUIRE THEM TO DO IT.

01:47:04.184 --> 01:47:05.952
THAT'S CORRECT. YEAH I THINK

01:47:06.019 --> 01:47:10.190
THAT'S FAIR OKAY. SO GIVEN AND I

01:47:10.257 --> 01:47:11.091
KNOW THE PEOPLE ON THE STATE

01:47:11.158 --> 01:47:13.293
WATER BOARD THEY REALLY CARE

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:15.562
ABOUT THE PURITY OF OUR WATER

01:47:15.629 --> 01:47:18.832
WHY AREN'T THEY DOING IT NOW. I

01:47:18.899 --> 01:47:21.535
THINK IT'S SO WHEN THIS FIRST

01:47:21.601 --> 01:47:24.738
CAME UP SO WE PETITIONED THE EPA

01:47:24.805 --> 01:47:26.873
MOM AND I WORK IN THE REASONS

01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:28.942
WHY BUT WE WERE GOING TO THE EPA

01:47:29.009 --> 01:47:30.877
NOT THE STATE WATER BOARD TO DO

01:47:30.944 --> 01:47:32.045
THIS THE EPA AGREED WITH OUR

01:47:32.112 --> 01:47:33.413
POSITION THAT THESE WERE LARGE

01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:34.881
CONTRIBUTORS OF POLLUTION BUT

01:47:34.948 --> 01:47:36.283
THEY DECIDED NOT TO GIVE A

01:47:36.349 --> 01:47:37.918
PERMIT BECAUSE THEY FELT THEY

01:47:37.984 --> 01:47:39.653
WERE THE MUNICIPAL PERMIT QUITE

01:47:39.719 --> 01:47:41.321
FRANKLY WOULD BE THE ONE TO

01:47:41.388 --> 01:47:42.823
HANDLE IT. AND THAT'S WHEN WE

01:47:42.889 --> 01:47:43.990
DID THE COURT CASE AND THE JUDGE

01:47:44.057 --> 01:47:46.193
SAID NO IF YOU DO FIND THEIR

01:47:46.259 --> 01:47:47.761
LARGE CONTRIBUTORS YOU HAVE TO

01:47:47.828 --> 01:47:49.196
GIVE THEM A PERMIT AND SO WE'VE

01:47:49.262 --> 01:47:50.764
BEEN CHUBB JUST STARTING WITH

01:47:50.831 --> 01:47:52.098
LOS ANGELES ALMOST AS A TEST

01:47:52.165 --> 01:47:54.534
CASES TO SEE HOW IT WORKS BUT

01:47:54.601 --> 01:47:55.769
AGAIN WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE

01:47:55.836 --> 01:47:58.605
STATEWIDE IN EVERY REGION THAT

01:47:58.672 --> 01:47:59.873
THESE ARE LARGE CONTRIBUTORS AND

01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:01.741
SO. IN FACT THIS REPORT MADE A

01:48:01.808 --> 01:48:04.010
JOKE ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN

01:48:04.077 --> 01:48:05.745
THIS FIRST HAPPENED AND THEY

01:48:05.812 --> 01:48:06.913
SAID- YOU KNOW WE'RE PROBABLY

01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:08.215
GONNA HAVE TO DO A STATEWIDE

01:48:08.281 --> 01:48:09.916
ORDER BECAUSE NGOS ARE GOING TO

01:48:09.983 --> 01:48:10.784
CONTINUE TO PETITION BECAUSE

01:48:10.851 --> 01:48:11.885
THEY HAVE THE EVIDENCE UP AND

01:48:11.952 --> 01:48:13.987
DOWN THE STATE AND THAT'S REALLY

01:48:14.054 --> 01:48:15.188
WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM WE DON'T

01:48:15.255 --> 01:48:16.957
WANT TO PETITION EVERY REGIONAL

01:48:17.023 --> 01:48:18.058
BOARD TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS

01:48:18.124 --> 01:48:20.026
AND DO A MALL INDIVIDUALLY WE

01:48:20.093 --> 01:48:21.027
FEEL LIKE THIS IS A MORE

01:48:21.094 --> 01:48:22.028
RESPONSIBLE AND LAID OUT

01:48:22.095 --> 01:48:23.864
APPROACH EVEN IF WE DON'T HAVE

01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:25.131
ALL THE- YOU KNOW EVERY BIT OF

01:48:25.198 --> 01:48:27.701
IT TO FIND IN THE LEAD. THIS THE

01:48:27.767 --> 01:48:29.102
SATURDAY SO I AM GIVING A BETTER

01:48:29.169 --> 01:48:31.004
FEELING FOR WHAT'S GOING ON HERE

01:48:31.071 --> 01:48:32.005
SO THE FACT THAT THE CHAMBER

01:48:32.072 --> 01:48:34.641
DOESN'T LIKE FAT PEOPLE CAN SUE

01:48:34.708 --> 01:48:36.643
THEY'RE SUING ALREADY AND THEY

01:48:36.710 --> 01:48:37.777
ALREADY HAVE THE ABILITY TO CALL

01:48:37.844 --> 01:48:39.279
AHEAD IF I COULD JUST RESPOND

01:48:39.346 --> 01:48:41.481
BRIEFLY TO THAT I THINK THE KEY

01:48:41.548 --> 01:48:44.184
DIFFERENCE HERE IS THAT- UNDER

OF THESE ISSUES. AND WE- ARE

01:49:17.584 --> 01:49:20.086
OPPOSED TO KIND OF. DETERMINING

01:49:20.153 --> 01:49:23.056
WHICH PRIORITIES WHERE THE-

01:49:23.123 --> 01:49:24.457
WATER BOARD PUTS THEIR ENERGY

01:49:24.524 --> 01:49:26.326
AND THEIR LIMITED STAFF TIME.

01:49:26.393 --> 01:49:28.261
ESPECIALLY AS OTHER COMMENTERS

01:49:28.328 --> 01:49:30.530
MENTIONED THERE. COMING UP ON-

01:49:30.597 --> 01:49:32.565

PERMITS SUCH AS THE INDUSTRIAL.

01:49:35.101 --> 01:49:35.869
AND CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER

01:49:35.936 --> 01:49:40.106
PERMITS. OKAY DO YOU AGREE WITH

RIGHT THAT OF WHAT WE WERE JUST

01:49:43.176 --> 01:49:45.078
DISCUSSING THE PETITIONS WERE TO

01:49:45.145 --> 01:49:46.579
THE WATER AGENCIES THEMSELVES

01:49:46.646 --> 01:49:49.215
NOT A PRIVATE- INDUSTRY. THIS

01:49:49.282 --> 01:49:51.651
PERMIT IF WHEN IT GETS A DOCTOR

01:49:51.718 --> 01:49:53.053
WHEN HE GOES FOR IT IS GOING TO

01:49:53.119 --> 01:49:55.155
BE VERY SIMILAR TO THE

01:49:55.221 --> 01:49:55.889
INDUSTRIAL STORMWATER PERMIT

01:49:55.956 --> 01:49:57.624
THAT WAS REFERENCED. I WILL SAY

01:49:57.691 --> 01:49:59.426
THAT THE LET ME ADJUST THE

01:49:59.492 --> 01:50:00.927
TIMING. OF THIS YEAR THEY'RE

01:50:00.994 --> 01:50:01.494
ADJUSTING TO THE STATEWIDE

01:50:01.561 --> 01:50:03.296
PERMITS NEXT YEAR THEY'RE

01:50:03.363 --> 01:50:04.464
PLANNING ON ADDRESSING THE

01:50:04.531 --> 01:50:06.032
INDUSTRIAL PERMIT SO THAT SHOULD

01:50:06.099 --> 01:50:07.367
BE DONE BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE

01:50:07.434 --> 01:50:08.802
CERTAINLY BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR.

01:50:08.868 --> 01:50:11.037
AND IF WE NEED TO WORK WITH SOME

01:50:11.104 --> 01:50:13.006
OF THE FOLKS THAT SPOKE TO MAKE

01:50:13.073 --> 01:50:14.107
SURE THAT THOSE PERMITS GET DONE

01:50:14.174 --> 01:50:15.275
FIRST THAT'S MY PRIORITY TO LIKE

01:50:15.342 --> 01:50:17.143
WHAT I THINK WE'RE ALL WANT

01:50:17.210 --> 01:50:18.912
THOSE TO GET DONE FIRST AND SO

01:50:18.979 --> 01:50:20.313
WE'RE HAPPY TO. TO MAKE LANGUAGE

01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:21.881
CHANGES- FOR THAT AS FOR THE

01:50:21.948 --> 01:50:24.951
PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL LAWSUITS.

01:50:25.018 --> 01:50:26.786
THERE ISN'T NECESSARILY IT THE

01:50:26.853 --> 01:50:28.221
PARENT NEEDS TO BE AN NPDES

01:50:28.288 --> 01:50:29.923
PERMIT UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT

01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:31.157
AND THE CLEAN MARK DOES PROVIDE

01:50:31.224 --> 01:50:32.292
FOR CITIZENS WHO PROVISIONS. BUT

01:50:32.359 --> 01:50:34.527
THE REASON WE LIKE THIS THIS

01:50:34.594 --> 01:50:36.229
THIS THE WAY THIS DIRECTION OF

01:50:36.296 --> 01:50:38.098
THE WELL IT WAS THE LOS ANGELES

01:50:38.164 --> 01:50:39.933
PERMIT IS GOING IS AGAIN THERE'S

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:40.500
THREE COMPLIANCE OPTIONS.

01:50:40.567 --> 01:50:42.168
THERE'S THE OPTION ONE WHICH IS

01:50:42.235 --> 01:50:42.969
MEET WATER QUALITY STANDARDS AT

01:50:43.036 --> 01:50:45.005
THE END OF YOUR PROPERTY. THAT

01:50:45.071 --> 01:50:46.272
IS THE SCENARIO WHERE IF THEY

01:50:46.339 --> 01:50:47.540
WEREN'T MEETING THE STANDARDS

01:50:47.607 --> 01:50:49.075
YES THIS IS A GROUP LIKE MINE

01:50:49.142 --> 01:50:50.477
COULD BRING AN ENFORCEMENT

01:50:50.543 --> 01:50:52.379
ACTION BUT WE'RE PROVIDING. OR

01:50:52.445 --> 01:50:54.080
THE LOS ANGELES ONE IS PROVIDING

01:50:54.147 --> 01:50:56.182
HAPPY TO PUT IT IN IF IT'S NOT

01:50:56.249 --> 01:50:57.817
SO BUT THE OTHER TWO OPTIONS

01:50:57.884 --> 01:50:59.019
WHICH- ALL YOU YOU DO IT AND

01:50:59.085 --> 01:51:00.020
THERE'S NO SENSE IN PRIVATE

01:51:00.086 --> 01:51:01.521
THERE'S NO SENSE IN ENFORCEMENT

01:51:01.588 --> 01:51:03.023
AND THAT IS EITHER BUILDING

01:51:03.089 --> 01:51:04.157
STORM WATER CAPTURE ON YOUR

01:51:04.224 --> 01:51:05.358
PROPERTY AS DISCUSSED AT THE

01:51:05.425 --> 01:51:07.260
BEGINNING. OR PAYING INTO THE

01:51:07.327 --> 01:51:07.927
MUNICIPAL FUND AND ONCE YOU DO

01:51:07.994 --> 01:51:09.262
THAT YOU'RE IN COMPLIANCE THERE

01:51:09.329 --> 01:51:10.930
IS NO SAID SOME CHECKPOINTS. WE

01:51:10.997 --> 01:51:12.332
HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IT'S GOING TO

01:51:12.399 --> 01:51:15.035
COST FOR FIVE ACRE PARKING LOT

01:51:15.101 --> 01:51:20.040
TO. HOW MUCH THEY'RE GOING TO

01:51:20.106 --> 01:51:23.276
HAVE TO GIVE OVER. I'M NOT AN

01:51:23.343 --> 01:51:25.512
ENGINEER SO OB WE- I DON'T HAVE

01:51:25.578 --> 01:51:27.213
THAT NUMBER IS A BIT MILLIONS OR

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:28.882
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OR TENS OF

01:51:28.948 --> 01:51:30.750
THOUSANDS. AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW

01:51:30.817 --> 01:51:32.052
DON'T ANSWER IT'S NOT IN THE

01:51:32.118 --> 01:51:33.586
MILLIONS PER PER FACILITY

01:51:33.653 --> 01:51:36.489
CERTAINLY. IT'S MORE IN THAT THE

01:51:36.556 --> 01:51:40.560
THOUSANDS- AND IT THE IDEA WOULD

01:51:40.627 --> 01:51:42.195
BE SIMILAR TO WHAT'S IN SO THIS

01:51:42.262 --> 01:51:44.197
WAS REFERENCED EARLIER. ON IN

01:51:44.264 --> 01:51:45.465
PERMITS RIGHT NOW IF YOU DO

01:51:45.532 --> 01:51:47.467
DEVELOPMENT OR REDEVELOPMENT-

01:51:47.534 --> 01:51:49.436
YOU HAVE TO BUILD A STORMWATER

01:51:49.502 --> 01:51:50.870
CAPTURE PROJECTS UP TO THE

01:51:50.937 --> 01:51:52.072
EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE STORM I

01:51:52.138 --> 01:51:53.873
WILL GET INTO ALL THAT YEAH

01:51:53.940 --> 01:51:55.041
YEAH. BUT THAT'S ESSENTIALLY

01:51:55.108 --> 01:51:55.942
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN HERE EIGHTY

01:51:56.009 --> 01:51:57.277
FIFTH PERCENTILE SO IT'S

01:51:57.343 --> 01:51:59.879
ESSENTIALLY- IF IT WAS A

01:51:59.946 --> 01:52:01.147
REDEVELOPMENT OR DEVELOPMENT

01:52:01.214 --> 01:52:02.749
PROJECT IT'S THE SAME SIZE

01:52:02.816 --> 01:52:06.786
CAPTURE. ALL RIGHT. VERY GOOD. I

01:52:06.853 --> 01:52:08.421
HAVE A BETTER IDEA WHAT YOU'RE

01:52:08.488 --> 01:52:11.057
TALKING ABOUT NOW THANK YOU-

01:52:11.124 --> 01:52:13.993
MISTER RIVAS. YOU CAN TAKE AS

01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:15.995
LONG AS YOU WANT TO CLOSE

01:52:16.062 --> 01:52:17.630
RESPECT BASS WHEN I VOTE MR WORK

01:52:17.697 --> 01:52:19.766
I HAVE- YOU KNOW I'VE

01:52:19.833 --> 01:52:21.101
APPRECIATED ALL THE ENGAGEMENT

01:52:21.167 --> 01:52:22.235
WE WORK CLOSELY WITH STEPS ARE

01:52:22.302 --> 01:52:24.037
VERY CLOSE TO THE GERMAN

01:52:24.104 --> 01:52:25.371
COMMERCE OF EXPECTED NUMBER

01:52:25.438 --> 01:52:26.172
THEIR MOMENTS WE ARE WAITING FOR

01:52:26.239 --> 01:52:27.207
SOME ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE FROM

01:52:27.273 --> 01:52:29.242
THEM- AND AS ALWAYS WE WILL

01:52:29.309 --> 01:52:31.377
ENGAGE- ANY AND ALL. BECAUSE WE

01:52:31.444 --> 01:52:33.246
CERTAINLY WANT TO GET IT RIGHT-

01:52:33.313 --> 01:52:35.248
WE WANT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE

01:52:35.315 --> 01:52:37.016
YEAH THANK YOU DR WORK ALL RIGHT

01:52:37.083 --> 01:52:42.322
SO WE EARLIER THIS YEAR WE HELD-

01:52:42.388 --> 01:52:44.891
FORUM. OKAY WAS IT LAST YEAR AT

01:52:44.958 --> 01:52:47.160
THE FARM ON PLASTIC. JAAP

01:52:47.227 --> 01:52:51.464
PLASTIC GOING INTO THE- LOCAL-

01:52:51.531 --> 01:52:55.135
A. WATERS OCEAN WATERS IT CETERA

01:52:55.201 --> 01:52:57.103
THAT'S ONE TYPE OF POLLUTION AND

01:52:57.170 --> 01:52:59.239
OIL AND SUCH IS PROBABLY THE

01:52:59.305 --> 01:53:01.341
NEXT TYPE OF POLLUTION WERE

01:53:01.407 --> 01:53:03.743
PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT. I

01:53:03.810 --> 01:53:05.478
DO THINK WE HAVE TO FIND A

01:53:05.545 --> 01:53:07.413
SOLUTION I DO THINK THAT HAVING

01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:10.250
THE STATE WIDE APPROACH TO THE

01:53:10.316 --> 01:53:13.920
PERMITTING DOES MAKE SENSE- I

01:53:13.987 --> 01:53:15.788
THINK THE BIG QUESTION IS WHEN

01:53:15.855 --> 01:53:18.124
THIS IS OUT THERE JUST HOW MUCH

01:53:18.191 --> 01:53:20.560
OF A BURDEN IT'S GOING TO BE ON

01:53:20.627 --> 01:53:23.263
THE STATE AND I THINK THAT'S

01:53:23.329 --> 01:53:24.797
THAT'S THE QUESTION WE DON'T

01:53:24.864 --> 01:53:26.733
REALLY HAVE AN ANSWER TO. OUR

01:53:26.799 --> 01:53:30.937
BOT- THAT IS THE SORT OF

01:53:31.004 --> 01:53:32.372
QUESTION THAT THEY THEY LOOK AT

01:53:32.438 --> 01:53:35.308
IN APPROPRIATIONS IT'S NOT THE

01:53:35.375 --> 01:53:35.775
RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS

01:53:35.842 --> 01:53:38.311
COMMITTEE. RESPONSIBILITY OF

01:53:38.378 --> 01:53:40.580
THIS COMMITTEE IS TO SAY DOES

01:53:40.647 --> 01:53:42.782
THIS MAKE SENSE FROM A CLEAN

01:53:42.849 --> 01:53:47.520
WATER POINT OF VIEW. THE DOLLARS

01:53:47.587 --> 01:53:50.190
. THAT ENDED I MEAN THE STATE

01:53:50.256 --> 01:53:52.225
HAS AN AWFUL LOT OF PARKING LOT

01:53:52.292 --> 01:53:53.860
IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO PAY A HUGE

01:53:53.927 --> 01:53:55.862
AMOUNT OF MONEY IF IT'S A HUGE

01:53:55.929 --> 01:53:57.897
AMOUNT OF MONEY TO DO THIS SO

01:53:57.964 --> 01:53:59.832
THAT IS GOING TO BE LOOKED AT AS

01:53:59.899 --> 01:54:01.901
WELL AS DO WE NEED TO REIMBURSE

01:54:01.968 --> 01:54:03.903
LOCAL CITIES AT CETERA SO I

01:54:03.970 --> 01:54:06.139
THINK THAT'S MORE OF A MATTER

01:54:06.206 --> 01:54:08.007
FOR APPROPRIATIONS I THINK THE

01:54:08.074 --> 01:54:10.810
VOTE I'M ASKING FOR HERE IS DO

01:54:10.877 --> 01:54:12.312
WE REALLY WANT TO CLEAN UP

01:54:12.378 --> 01:54:13.813
STORMWATER. THIS SEEMS TO BE THE

01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:15.114
RIGHT TIME AND THE RIGHT

01:54:15.181 --> 01:54:18.117
APPROACH TO DO IT SO I'M GOING

01:54:18.184 --> 01:54:22.455
TO ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. AND- BUT

01:54:22.522 --> 01:54:24.724
- WE CLEARLY WE NEED TO GET MORE

01:54:24.791 --> 01:54:26.826
DEFINITION BEFORE IT GETS

01:54:26.893 --> 01:54:28.595
THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS AND ON TO

01:54:28.661 --> 01:54:30.530
THE FLOOR IN TERMS OF COST I

01:54:30.597 --> 01:54:33.166
THINK THAT IS CHAMBERS VERY

01:54:33.233 --> 01:54:34.934
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND I THINK

01:54:35.001 --> 01:54:36.069
THEY SHOULD BE AND I THINK

01:54:36.135 --> 01:54:38.171
THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO DO

01:54:38.238 --> 01:54:39.405
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME WILL

01:54:39.472 --> 01:54:40.840
CERTAINLY HAVE A BETTER IDEA IN

01:54:40.907 --> 01:54:42.242
THE COMING WEEKS OF WHAT'S

01:54:42.308 --> 01:54:44.944

INDUSTRY KILLER. SPEAKING

02:48:44.647 --> 02:48:46.115
GENERALLY TEXTILES HAVE A

02:49:13.343 --> 02:49:14.577
THE DEFINITION OF TEXTILE

02:49:14.644 --> 02:49:16.679

02:57:29.138 --> 02:57:31.907
BECAUSE THE- DEPARTMENT OF

02:57:31.974 --> 02:57:35.311
TOXICS AND- S. SUBSTANTIVE

02:57:35.378 --> 02:57:38.647

COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. WE TALK

02:57:46.222 --> 02:57:49.058

SUBSTITUTIONS TAKING PLACE IN

02:57:51.260 --> 02:57:56.766

HOW IS THIS BILL. IS THERE A

02:58:10.713 --> 02:58:12.848
CONCERN THAT THIS BILL MAY LEAD

02:58:12.915 --> 02:58:15.117
TO WORSE OUTCOMES. I KNOW WE

02:58:15.184 --> 02:58:17.286

MEAN ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS

02:58:22.324 --> 02:58:23.826
WE'RE DOING THIS IS BECAUSE OF

02:58:23.893 --> 02:58:25.061
ALL THE WATER CONTAMINATION

02:58:25.127 --> 02:58:27.063

CONTAMINATION- THAT IS ONE OF

02:58:33.836 --> 02:58:35.704
THE- MAJOR OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE

02:58:35.771 --> 02:58:37.573
CONCERNED ABOUT IN TERMS OF.

02:58:37.640 --> 02:58:40.009

BY DOING SO I THINK WORK- WE'RE

02:58:43.079 --> 02:58:44.680
WE'RE MOVING TOWARD THAT GOAL OF

02:58:44.747 --> 02:58:45.915
HAVING CLEANER WATER ESPECIALLY

02:58:45.981 --> 02:58:48.784

AND-  AGREE THE WATER IS REALLY

03:00:19.742 --> 03:00:20.643
CRITICAL ILLNESS I THINK YOU

03:00:20.709 --> 03:00:21.977
KNOW WE'VE HAD TO SHUT DOWN

03:00:22.044 --> 03:00:24.246
SEVERAL WELLS IN MY DISTRICT AS

INCREDIBLY AWARE OF AND

03:00:27.683 --> 03:00:29.151
UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF WORKING

03:00:29.218 --> 03:00:31.320
TOWARDS I GUESS MIGHT HAVE A

03:00:31.387 --> 03:00:33.155
COUPLE I'M CONCERNS WITH THE

03:00:33.222 --> 03:00:35.291
BELL. THE FIRST I GUESS THE

03:00:35.357 --> 03:00:37.326
SIMPLEST ONE WILL START WITH

03:00:37.393 --> 03:00:38.327
WHICH IS- THE BILL FOCUSES ON

03:00:38.394 --> 03:00:39.962
THE POINT OF SALE RIGHT WE'RE

03:00:40.029 --> 03:00:41.864
BANNING THE POINT OF SALE APP

03:00:41.931 --> 03:00:44.233
FOR THESE ITEMS AND I GUESS I

03:00:44.300 --> 03:00:45.701
UNDERSTAND LARGE MANUFACTURERS

03:00:45.768 --> 03:00:47.903
SERVICE STORES THAT THEY MAKE

03:00:47.970 --> 03:00:49.905
THEIR OWN CLOTHING IF YOU WELL-

03:00:49.972 --> 03:00:52.575
BUT- ATHLETES ARE IS NOW A VERY

03:00:52.641 --> 03:00:53.976
POPULAR ITEM IN CALIFORNIA'S

03:00:54.043 --> 03:00:55.211
BOUTIQUE SAYS THAT'S WHAT MOST

03:00:55.277 --> 03:00:57.079
PEOPLE WHERE MOST OF THE TIME

03:00:57.146 --> 03:00:59.148
POST CODE. SO I GUESS PART OF MY

03:00:59.215 --> 03:01:00.416
CONCERN IS IF WE'RE TELLING

03:01:00.482 --> 03:01:03.385
SELLERS NOT TO SELL IT BUT WE'RE

03:01:03.452 --> 03:01:04.987
NOT DOING ANYTHING TO THOSE THAT

03:01:05.054 --> 03:01:05.955
. MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTE IT

03:01:06.021 --> 03:01:07.122
HOW DO WE HOW DO THOSE SELLERS

03:01:07.189 --> 03:01:08.457
NECESSARILY ESPECIALLY OUR SMALL

03:01:08.524 --> 03:01:10.859
SELLERS NOTE WHETHER COMPLIANCE

03:01:10.926 --> 03:01:15.898
OR NOT WITH THIS LAW. I DON'T.

03:01:15.965 --> 03:01:17.833
YEAH I THINK I THINK IT'S A FAIR

03:01:17.900 --> 03:01:18.934
QUESTION WHICH I THINK WE'RE

03:01:19.001 --> 03:01:21.136
HAPPY TO EXPLORE THINK FOR US WE

03:01:21.203 --> 03:01:22.972
HAD AS WE HAD TALKED YESTERDAY

03:01:23.038 --> 03:01:24.907
PRIMARILY LOOKED AT SOME OF THE

03:01:24.974 --> 03:01:28.310
LARGER COMPANIES- AND WE HADN'T-

03:01:28.377 --> 03:01:30.379
HI THERE EXEMPTED SMALLER

03:01:30.446 --> 03:01:32.414
SELLERS ARE LOOKED AT LABELING

03:01:32.481 --> 03:01:33.849
BUT THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE

03:01:33.916 --> 03:01:34.984
COULD DEFINITELY TOUGHER LOOK AT

03:01:35.050 --> 03:01:35.985
TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE SECONDS

03:01:36.051 --> 03:01:38.254
CLEAR EDUCATION AND GUIDANCE I

03:01:38.320 --> 03:01:38.821
UNDERSTAND ESPECIALLY WHEN

03:01:38.887 --> 03:01:41.023
YOU'RE A MOM AND POP UP BOUTIQUE

03:01:41.090 --> 03:01:43.092
YOU KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE TIME TO

03:01:43.158 --> 03:01:44.193
DO ALL THIS RESEARCH ABOUT EVERY

03:01:44.260 --> 03:01:45.327
SINGLE ONE OF THEIR PRODUCTS OF.

03:01:45.394 --> 03:01:47.096
WOULD BE HAPPIER OKAY FOR HOW TO

03:01:47.162 --> 03:01:48.931
PROPERLY DRESSED UP THANK YOU AB

03:01:48.998 --> 03:01:50.933
AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:53.802
WHICH IS LESS THAN WELL- IS SO.

03:01:53.869 --> 03:01:55.304
I DON'T KNOW THAT I FEEL LIKE

03:01:55.371 --> 03:01:57.706
THIS SCIENCE HAS BEEN CLEARLY

03:01:57.773 --> 03:02:04.480
pHEARD YOUR WITNESS AND I

03:02:04.546 --> 03:02:06.282
APOLOGIZE BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER

03:02:06.348 --> 03:02:08.117
HER NAME FROM SPRING.

03:02:08.183 --> 03:02:09.685
CALIBRATING FOR THE SPANISH

03:02:09.752 --> 03:02:11.220
TALKING ABOUT SORT OF EXPOSURE

03:02:11.287 --> 03:02:12.288
EVEN THROUGH THE WEARING OF

03:02:12.354 --> 03:02:14.256
THESE CLOTHES THAT WAS THE FIRST

03:02:14.323 --> 03:02:15.958
I HEARD OF THAT AS A POTENTIAL

03:02:16.025 --> 03:02:18.594
POINT OF EXPOSURE- AND I'VE SEEN

03:02:18.661 --> 03:02:19.428
AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S

03:02:19.495 --> 03:02:21.297
ANY SCIENCE IN THE ANALYSIS THAT

03:02:21.363 --> 03:02:23.265
INDICATES THAT AS FAR AS I CAN

03:02:23.332 --> 03:02:25.134
SEE. WHERE THAT IS BEEN

03:02:25.200 --> 03:02:26.268
PRESENTED TO ME ALTHOUGH NO

03:02:26.335 --> 03:02:27.102
SCIENCES BEEN PRESENTED TO ME AT

03:02:27.169 --> 03:02:30.039
ALL ON THIS TOPIC WHICH- I WISH

03:02:30.105 --> 03:02:34.276
WHAT HAPPENS ENERGY SEE- AND- SO

03:02:34.343 --> 03:02:35.544
THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES OKAY

03:02:35.611 --> 03:02:37.313
IS IT IS THAT WE'RE CONCERNED

03:02:37.379 --> 03:02:38.347
ABOUT ARE WE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

03:02:38.414 --> 03:02:40.115
WATER WAYS WHICH IS WHAT I HEAR

03:02:40.182 --> 03:02:42.151
MR TEAM TALKING ABOUT. AND THEN

03:02:42.217 --> 03:02:43.218
IT SEEMS LIKE VERY

03:02:43.285 --> 03:02:44.953
STRAIGHTFORWARD SCIENCE SHOULD

03:02:45.020 --> 03:02:47.089
BE AVAILABLE ON WHETHER OR NOT

03:02:47.156 --> 03:02:48.023
THIS IS COMING OUT WASHING

03:02:48.090 --> 03:02:49.958
MACHINES RIGHT AND I'VE YET TO

03:02:50.025 --> 03:02:51.794
SEE THAT AND SO I THINK THAT

03:02:51.860 --> 03:02:54.163
BANNING THE SALE OF. LARGE

03:02:54.229 --> 03:02:55.798
CLASSES OF ATHLETIC WEAR

03:02:55.864 --> 03:02:57.433
INCLUDING IN CALIFORNIA IS NOT A

03:02:57.499 --> 03:02:59.368
SMALL MOVE TO TAKE AND IT IS

03:02:59.435 --> 03:03:01.036
IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THE

03:03:01.103 --> 03:03:02.771
SCIENCE TO BACK IT UP AND I FEEL

03:03:02.838 --> 03:03:04.106
LIKE THE SIGNS THAT HAVE BEEN

03:03:04.173 --> 03:03:05.974
PRESENTED IS WELL THEN OUR WATER

03:03:06.041 --> 03:03:07.309
WHICH WE KNOW BUT WE ALSO KNOW

03:03:07.376 --> 03:03:09.011
THERE'S MULTIPLE SOURCES OF

03:03:09.078 --> 03:03:11.714
THIS. SO IS THIS THE SOURCE. IS

03:03:11.780 --> 03:03:12.314
THIS A SOURCE CONCERN AND- I

03:03:12.381 --> 03:03:14.350
JUST WANT THERE TO BE MORE

03:03:14.416 --> 03:03:14.983
CLARITY FOR GONNA TAKE THE MOVE

03:03:15.050 --> 03:03:17.586
TO BAN THE SALE OF THESE. THE

03:03:17.653 --> 03:03:19.421
VAST PRODUCTS THAT THIS IS ON.

03:03:19.488 --> 03:03:22.958

REQUESTED OF VOLUMES ON

03:03:29.064 --> 03:03:32.568

BECAUSE I THINK THE RESEARCH IS

03:03:39.541 --> 03:03:41.009
FAIRLY CLEAR- I DON'T KNOW IF

03:03:41.076 --> 03:03:42.911

TOUCHING THE SKIN OR THE PRODUCT

03:03:53.355 --> 03:03:54.623
THE TEXTILE TOUCHING THE SKIN

03:03:54.690 --> 03:03:57.059
ISSUE. BUT HAPPY TO LET THE

03:03:57.126 --> 03:03:58.360
EXPERTS KIND OF HANDLE THAT NE

03:03:58.427 --> 03:04:02.231
BUT WOULD HAPPEN TO CATCH ALL

03:04:02.297 --> 03:04:05.300
THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IN IT.

03:04:05.367 --> 03:04:07.469
SURE I'D BE HAPPY TO ADD ON IN

03:04:07.536 --> 03:04:08.537
THE THAT'S REALLY GREAT QUESTION

03:04:08.604 --> 03:04:10.572
THAT YOU ASK AND- I YOU KNOW I

03:04:10.639 --> 03:04:12.341
DON'T THINK IT'S- A MATTER OF

03:04:12.408 --> 03:04:14.443
HUMAN DIRECT HUMAN EXPOSURE OR

03:04:14.510 --> 03:04:16.245
VERSES. YOU CHEMICAL COMING UP

03:04:16.311 --> 03:04:18.046
IN DRINKING WATER I THINK THESE

03:04:18.113 --> 03:04:21.116
CONCERNED COVER BOTH- THIRD AT

03:04:21.183 --> 03:04:23.352
TEN VERY LITTLE STUDY OF-

03:04:23.419 --> 03:04:26.889
ABSORPTION THROUGH THE SKIN- OF

03:04:26.955 --> 03:04:28.524
P. FAST CHEMICALS FROM PRODUCTS

03:04:28.590 --> 03:04:30.359
SECTION. ARE TREATED WITH PEE

03:04:30.426 --> 03:04:32.995
FAST- AND THE WORK THAT'S BEEN

03:04:33.061 --> 03:04:34.163
DONE HAS BEEN PRETTY MUCH

03:04:34.229 --> 03:04:36.365
LIMITED TO ONE OR TWO CHEMICALS-

03:04:36.432 --> 03:04:38.267
BUT IN ADDITION TO THE LARGE

03:04:38.333 --> 03:04:40.068
POLYMERS THAT ARE PRESENT IN

03:04:40.135 --> 03:04:42.404
PRODUCTS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF-

03:04:42.471 --> 03:04:45.841
SMALLER CHEMICALS- THAT. TIME

03:04:45.908 --> 03:04:48.811
ARE YOU STILL PROCESSING AIDS-

03:04:48.877 --> 03:04:50.612
IN MAKING THE POLYMERS THAT MAY

03:04:50.679 --> 03:04:53.148
ALSO BE PRESENT IN THE PRODUCT-

03:04:53.215 --> 03:04:54.950
WE ALSO KNOW THAT PIZZA CAN BE.

03:04:55.017 --> 03:04:57.186
VOLATILE LIES AS WELL- AND UP

03:04:57.252 --> 03:04:59.521
AND IN DR SO THERE ARE NUMEROUS

03:04:59.588 --> 03:05:01.557
WAYS THAT P. FAST IN PRODUCT.

03:05:01.623 --> 03:05:03.859
CAN INCREASE EXPOSURES THROUGH

03:05:03.926 --> 03:05:05.794
HOUSTON WEARING UP THE PRODUCT.

03:05:05.861 --> 03:05:07.095
AS WELL AS THE BROADER LIFE

03:05:07.162 --> 03:05:11.767
CYCLE CONCERNS AND THE.

03:05:11.834 --> 03:05:12.267
POTENTIAL TO CONTAMINATE

03:05:12.334 --> 03:05:15.170
DRINKING WATER. I CAN. QUICKLY

03:05:15.237 --> 03:05:17.239
ADD THAT YOU KNOW THE IDEA HERE

03:05:17.306 --> 03:05:19.441
IS TO BROADBAND UPON A CATEGORY

03:05:19.508 --> 03:05:21.643
THAT THE BAND. HARMFUL CHEMICALS

03:05:21.710 --> 03:05:22.845
AND UNDER LOTS OF PRODUCTS

03:05:22.911 --> 03:05:24.680
ALREADY ON THE MARKET. I DON'T

03:05:24.746 --> 03:05:27.049
USE THE CHEMICAL- AND- YOU KNOW

03:05:27.115 --> 03:05:28.217
THOSE BECAUSE OF THE HARMS

03:05:28.283 --> 03:05:29.384
ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHEMICAL

03:05:29.451 --> 03:05:32.321
BELIEVE. THAT THE- THAT I

03:05:32.387 --> 03:05:37.226
JUSTIFIED EFFECTIVE. AND ALL

03:05:37.292 --> 03:05:38.794
KIND OF VERY VALUABLE. TERMINAIS

03:05:38.861 --> 03:05:40.028
SPEAKER THIS ISSUE VERY BRIEFLY

03:05:40.095 --> 03:05:42.998
SURE. I WOULD AGREE THAT THE-

03:05:43.065 --> 03:05:44.700
EXPOSURE STUDIES ARE PRIMARILY

03:05:44.766 --> 03:05:48.103
LIMITED TO PFOA ANOTHER ACID NON

03:05:48.170 --> 03:05:51.874
POLYMERIC P. FAST- AND I WOULD

03:05:51.940 --> 03:05:54.176
ALSO JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT THE

03:05:54.243 --> 03:05:55.277
PRODUCTS THAT I WAS DISCUSSING

03:05:55.344 --> 03:05:56.945
TODAY ARE NOT. WASHED IN A

03:05:57.012 --> 03:05:58.580
WASHING MACHINE- I DON'T KNOW

03:05:58.647 --> 03:06:00.782
HOW THEY MAKE IT INTO A WATER

03:06:00.849 --> 03:06:01.783
TABLE. PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THEY

03:06:01.850 --> 03:06:03.652
ARE A POLYMER AND NOT GOING TO

03:06:03.719 --> 03:06:05.354
GO AND NOT REALLY WATER SOLUBLE

03:06:05.420 --> 03:06:06.555
SO I JUST DON'T THINK THOSE

03:06:06.622 --> 03:06:09.825
CONCERNS BEING EXPRESSED OUR-

03:06:09.892 --> 03:06:12.594
WOULD WOULD. THERE'S NO UTILITY

03:06:12.661 --> 03:06:14.062
TO BANNING P. FAST IN THE

03:06:14.129 --> 03:06:14.730
CATEGORY OF PRODUCTS AND

03:06:14.796 --> 03:06:18.300
DISCOUNTS. SO FIRST OF ALL I

03:06:18.367 --> 03:06:19.935
DON'T KNOW WHAT. THE FEST

03:06:20.002 --> 03:06:21.937
PROBLEM AREAS AND WE'RE GOING TO

03:06:22.004 --> 03:06:23.338
HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT AND I

03:06:23.405 --> 03:06:25.073
WILL GO THROUGH THAT. BOB DID

03:06:25.140 --> 03:06:27.509
YOUR DO YOUR EXPERTS HAVE A

03:06:27.576 --> 03:06:29.611
COMMENT ON P. FAST POLYMERS. A

03:06:29.678 --> 03:06:35.350
LOT OFTEN TWO OTHER MISTER CAR.

03:06:35.417 --> 03:06:36.518
TO CAR DOCTOR SCHNEIDER HAVE ANY

03:06:36.585 --> 03:06:38.787
COMMENT ON THAT. ON THE P. FAST

03:06:38.854 --> 03:06:41.256
POLITICIANS START UP. YES I'M

03:06:41.323 --> 03:06:42.858
HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THAT PART

03:06:42.925 --> 03:06:44.259
SECOND NINE BY DOCTOR SHAPESHIFT

03:06:44.326 --> 03:06:46.428
THAT FIRE TO FOLLOW UP- THE

03:06:46.495 --> 03:06:47.996
FIRST THING I'LL SAY IS THAT THE

03:06:48.063 --> 03:06:49.998
TV AT THE DEPARTMENT TALKING

03:06:50.065 --> 03:06:52.034
CONTROL I LOOKED AT THIS ISSUE

03:06:52.100 --> 03:06:54.036
AND REGULATE IT HALF OF THE

03:06:54.102 --> 03:06:55.470
CLASS AND THEY SAY THAT ALL

03:06:55.537 --> 03:06:57.906
THOSE NEED TO BE AT THAT AGE.

03:06:57.973 --> 03:06:59.241
WHICH ARE EITHER THE BUILDING

03:06:59.308 --> 03:07:01.276
BLOCKS OF THAT OR THE-

03:07:01.343 --> 03:07:02.778
DEGRADATION PRODUCTS OF ALL

03:07:02.844 --> 03:07:04.680
THESE THAT THEY PUTTING POLITICS

03:07:04.746 --> 03:07:06.515
AND THEREFORE THAT NEEDS-

03:07:06.582 --> 03:07:08.517
MATERIAL AND UP- IN OUR

03:07:08.584 --> 03:07:10.752
ENVIRONMENT AND IN OUR BODY. AND

03:07:10.819 --> 03:07:12.921
THAT EVEN DIE FOR THE LIFE CYCLE

03:07:12.988 --> 03:07:15.791
OF COLIN WAS NOT AS BIG AS THEY

03:07:15.857 --> 03:07:19.461
BEGIN MONDAY AND UP IN- IN.

03:07:19.528 --> 03:07:20.862
LANDFILL OF THE COMMISSION TO

03:07:20.929 --> 03:07:23.231
WATER TABLES AND ONE CLOTHING AS

03:07:23.298 --> 03:07:25.200
MUCH MAKE IT END UP IN THE WATER

03:07:25.267 --> 03:07:27.102
TABLE THAT WAY AS WELL FINALLY I

03:07:27.169 --> 03:07:34.142
ALSO WANTED. TO JUST FLAG THAT-

03:07:34.209 --> 03:07:36.311
IT DOES NOT COME ITEM AND BY THE

03:07:36.378 --> 03:07:37.479
TERRY. THE LITTLE FOR EARLIER

03:07:37.546 --> 03:07:40.082
THE CAN. NO COVERED TECH. NO HOW

03:07:40.148 --> 03:07:43.085
TO GOOD AND- YEAH. IS SO BOTTOM

03:07:43.151 --> 03:07:48.557
LINE EVAN ABILITY TO CARE. OUT.

03:07:48.624 --> 03:07:49.992
BOB SO THERE SHOULD THEY HAVE

03:07:50.058 --> 03:07:52.628
THE SAME ISSUE. I'M GOING TO ASK

03:07:52.694 --> 03:07:53.261
MY- FELLOW TO LOOK INTO THIS.

03:07:53.328 --> 03:07:56.832
AND ILL GET AN ANSWER FOR YOU-

03:07:56.898 --> 03:08:02.004
BEFORE- IT. THE QUESTION IS DO

03:08:02.070 --> 03:08:04.640
WE LET IT OUT OF THE COMMITTEE

03:08:04.706 --> 03:08:06.942
TODAY OR DO YOU WANT TO WAIT.

03:08:07.009 --> 03:08:08.477
FOR MY NECK CHAIR I DON'T THE

03:08:08.543 --> 03:08:13.148
INTERNET MY OWN VOTE. IN THE- I

03:08:13.215 --> 03:08:15.183
DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS I

03:08:15.250 --> 03:08:19.121
DO WANT MY- SIZE FELLOW TO TAKE

03:08:19.187 --> 03:08:21.089
A LOOK INTO IT. SO THAT WE HAVE

03:08:21.156 --> 03:08:22.624
A BETTER IDEA SINCE THIS IS

03:08:22.691 --> 03:08:23.525
SOMETHING THAT WAS JUST BROUGHT

03:08:23.592 --> 03:08:26.261
UP HERE. I DO YOU KNOW IF THERE

03:08:26.328 --> 03:08:28.063
IS A PROBLEM WITH THE FAST AND

03:08:28.130 --> 03:08:29.031
THE ENVIRONMENT AND I INSISTED

03:08:29.097 --> 03:08:30.866
ON THAT BEFORE I ALLOWED THE

03:08:30.932 --> 03:08:33.201
BILL TO COME TO US AND IN

03:08:33.268 --> 03:08:35.604
PARTICULAR STUDY BY THE EUROPEAN

03:08:35.671 --> 03:08:37.739
COMMISSION DIRECTORATE GENERAL-

03:08:37.806 --> 03:08:39.841
FOUND THAT- IN FACT THESE

03:08:39.908 --> 03:08:42.077
TEXTILE. PRODUCTS CONTAINING P.

03:08:42.144 --> 03:08:45.847
FAST- DO YOU IN FACT CONTRIBUTE

03:08:45.914 --> 03:08:47.516
TO EMISSIONS OF P. FAST AS WELL

03:08:47.582 --> 03:08:49.217
AS CONTAMINATION OF SOIL AND

03:08:49.284 --> 03:08:51.753
DRINKING WATER I MEAN THAT'S

03:08:51.820 --> 03:08:54.656
DEFINITE- AND ACCORDING TO. THE

03:08:54.723 --> 03:08:56.591
DEPARTMENT OF- INCLUDING INFANTS

03:08:56.658 --> 03:08:57.893
YOUNG CHILDREN AND PEOPLE OF

03:08:57.959 --> 03:09:00.328
CHILD BEARING AGE. ARE SUPPOSED

03:09:00.395 --> 03:09:02.731
TO BE PASSED FROM LEFT LEATHER

03:09:02.798 --> 03:09:06.134
AND TEXTILE FURNISHINGS. AND IT

03:09:06.201 --> 03:09:07.703
FURTHER THE STUDY STATED P.

03:09:07.769 --> 03:09:09.371
FASHION TEXTILES CAN BE RELEASED

03:09:09.438 --> 03:09:11.540
INTO INDOOR AIR. HUMILIATING

03:09:11.606 --> 03:09:13.975
DUST AND YOUR EXPOSURE TO P.

03:09:14.042 --> 03:09:16.645
FASTER HERS WHEN PEOPLE INHALE

03:09:16.712 --> 03:09:18.346
AND INGEST THIS CONTAMINATED AIR

03:09:18.413 --> 03:09:21.216
AND DUST SO. I DON'T THINK THAT

03:09:21.283 --> 03:09:24.720
THERE'S A REASON TO. EXCLUDE OUR

03:09:24.786 --> 03:09:27.589
FURNITURE. IS WHAT IT COMES DOWN

03:09:27.656 --> 03:09:29.891
TO FIVE. AGAIN WE NEED TO TAKE A

03:09:29.958 --> 03:09:32.027
LOOK WORK I'M WILLING TO TAKE A

03:09:32.094 --> 03:09:34.196
LOOK AT ANY EVIDENCE YOU HAVE.

03:09:34.262 --> 03:09:36.965
HASN'T COME UP TILL NOW- I WOULD

03:09:37.032 --> 03:09:39.101
LIKE TO GET THE BILL OUT OF THE

03:09:39.167 --> 03:09:40.402
COMMITTEE UNLESS THERE'S PEOPLE

03:09:40.469 --> 03:09:42.370
WHO WANT TO KEEP IT IN THE

03:09:42.437 --> 03:09:43.605
COMMITTEE. UNTIL LOVE WE HAVE

03:09:43.672 --> 03:09:45.040
OUR NEXT HEARING BUT I WOULD

03:09:45.107 --> 03:09:46.942
LIKE TO GET IT OUT NOW AND IN

03:09:47.008 --> 03:09:48.176
THE MEANTIME WE CAN LOOK AT

03:09:48.243 --> 03:09:50.579
THESE ISSUES. AND I CAN WORK

03:09:50.645 --> 03:09:52.514
WITH THE AUTHOR ON THOSE SO. THE

03:09:52.581 --> 03:09:54.249
AUTHORS OKAY IN THE OPPOSITION

03:09:54.316 --> 03:09:58.487
IS OKAY. I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE

03:09:58.553 --> 03:10:01.923
BILL OUT TODAY. WE STILL WITH

03:10:01.990 --> 03:10:02.924
MORE QUESTIONS. BUT I DO FOR

03:10:02.991 --> 03:10:05.060
THAT WE OUGHT TO GIVE A FAIR.

03:10:05.127 --> 03:10:07.062
HEARING TO WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY

03:10:07.129 --> 03:10:09.364
AND- I HAVE SOMEBODY HERE WHO'S

03:10:09.431 --> 03:10:11.066
NOT AN EXPERT BUT HE HAS ALL THE

03:10:11.133 --> 03:10:13.001
BACKGROUND TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT

03:10:13.068 --> 03:10:15.670
YOU'RE SAYING AND- WILL BE GLAD

03:10:15.737 --> 03:10:17.405
TO LOOK AT ANY PAPERS AND SUCH

03:10:17.472 --> 03:10:20.041
THAT YOU HAVE SO WE WILL LOOK AT

03:10:20.108 --> 03:10:21.309
THAT IN GREATER DETAIL. ALL

03:10:21.376 --> 03:10:23.879
RIGHT MISS GARCIA JUST AS DOES

03:10:23.945 --> 03:10:26.481
THIS THE DISCUSSIONS CONTINUE TO

03:10:26.548 --> 03:10:29.718
SWANA CONTINUED AS TO. KEEP OUR

03:10:29.785 --> 03:10:33.155
P. FIVE AS A CLASS AND NOT START

03:10:33.221 --> 03:10:35.257
TO PUSH HIM OUT AS WE HAVE SEEN

03:10:35.323 --> 03:10:37.959
THE SHORT CHAIN BEHAVE VERY

03:10:38.026 --> 03:10:39.427
SIMILARLY TO THE LAUNCHINGS

03:10:39.494 --> 03:10:40.862
LAUNCHING SO SHE BREAKDOWN A

03:10:40.929 --> 03:10:42.964
LOOK LIKE THE CHARGING ALONG THE

03:10:43.031 --> 03:10:44.966
WAY AND SO AS WE ARE DOING THIS

03:10:45.033 --> 03:10:46.835
WORK I THINK IT'S REALLY

03:10:46.902 --> 03:10:47.469
IMPORTANT- WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY

03:10:47.536 --> 03:10:50.872
WASHING THIS FURNITURE OR- IN

03:10:50.939 --> 03:10:53.108
IN. THE LAUNDRY BUT THEY ARE

03:10:53.175 --> 03:10:54.876
ENDING UP IN OUR LANDFILLS AND

03:10:54.943 --> 03:10:56.077
THAT LAND FILLED AND IT- THE

03:10:56.144 --> 03:10:57.646
MATERIALS LEACHING INTO OUR

03:10:57.712 --> 03:10:59.981
WATER SYSTEM THAT WINTER GROUND

03:11:00.048 --> 03:11:01.750
THAT WAY AS WONDERS A LOT OF

03:11:01.817 --> 03:11:05.754
SCIENCE- ON THAT- AS WELL OUT

03:11:05.821 --> 03:11:07.055
THERE AND SO. I'M GONNA GO READ

03:11:07.122 --> 03:11:08.657

TO FIND COMMON GROUND AS

03:11:19.234 --> 03:11:20.836
POSSIBLE I THINK IT'S REALLY
