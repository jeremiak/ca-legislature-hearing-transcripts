IT'S VERY TO CRY ALL THE OF IN THIS. THAT EVERY CITY EVERY COUNTY BUT TO THE STATE IN ORGANIZING THE SAME WAY. SO THAT- YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY ISSUES ARE HANDLED AT AT AT AT A LOCAL LEVEL BUT THERE'S A COMMON ORGANIZATION IN PLACE WHEN WE QUICKLY AND OFTEN DO. HAVE TO MOBILIZE STATE RESOURCES TO HELP OUT- YES ARE THE UNIQUE ROLE OF UNDERSTANDING CAPABILITIES ACROSS GOVERNMENT AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR. AND SOMETHING THAT WERE CUSTOM TO BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF HAZARDS THAT CALIFORNIA SENSUALLY AND DOES FACE. EACH. AND EVERY YEAR. AND THEN WE DEPLOY. SHARING OF AND FOR PROBLEM SOLVING. I OUTLINED IT WILL BE THE STATE NUMBER PLAN. WHICH NOT ONLY. THE AMERICAN REGISTRY ORGANISING FOR HELPING WORKING. HELPING COME TOGETHER AND DECIDE.

AND FOR THE FOR THE SAME TYPE THEIR ORGANIZED THE SAME WAY. WE ALSO PLAY A ROLE AS A METHOD OF ACCESS IN TERMS OF THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THAT COMES. COMES IN PLAY INVOLVING THE **** FROM THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY ARE ENOUGH. THAT WE ARE THE OFFICE THE FACILITATES. THE REIMBURSEMENT OF DISASTER COSTS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS INVOLVED- PRESIDENTIAL DISASTER DECLARATION. SO NOT JUST FOR COVER THE FOR WHAT WILDFIRES OR EARTHQUAKES. PLANTED CENTER ARE. THE WITHOUT THAT'S JUST VERY MUCH AND I AND THAT'S WAY HELLO DOES THE POWER. MAKING WE HE TALKED OR CALL ABOUT HER GOOD FOR BY DIFFERENT. YOU KNOW. KIND OF SEE AN KNOW PLAY OF ALL THE THOSE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS. BUT I DO WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ON THE YOU AND I ABOUT OUR pOUT. AND I THINK IT YOU KNOW GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT THESE CLIMATE OR PREVENTHAZARDS CAN TAKE INTO PERSISTENT. CALIFORNIA AN IMPACT OR STATE WITH GREATER FREQUENCY AND- CONSEQUENCE. OF LAST YEAR'S FIRE SEASON- EXCEEDED YOUR RECORD IN TERMS OF THE HISTORIC NATURE AND ALL INDICATORS ARE THAT. I'M JUST AND THAT ONE CASE THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO SEE. REALLY I'M SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES FOR WILDFIRES. SO WITH THAT WE HAVE CONSIDER CLIMATE CHANGE IN OUR CALIFORNIA'S RISK REDUCTION STRATEGY. SINCE WAY BACK YOU KNOW IN THAT- YEAH TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN- YOU KNOW THAT'S KIND OF ONE OF THE EARLIEST POINTS WHEN OUR STATE WILL BE COLOR STATE HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN WHICH IS AT RISK REDUCTION STRATEGY HAS REFLECTED WHAT WE NEED WITH THE TIME. ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND EVER SINCE THEN AND NOW WE'RE HERE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THAT HAS MATURED- MARWAR S. YEAH THAT IS MORE SCIENCE MORE DATA BECAME AVAILABLE ON THE WAIT REASON THAT'S IMPORTANT OUR STATE MITIGATION PLAN. IT'S ACTUALLY THE DRIVER FOR HOW WE INVEST IN RISK REDUCTION AND RESILIENCE IN CALIFORNIA SO THE DIRECT CORRELATION. TO BE ABROGATED INFORMATION THAT'S IN THE PLANT. INTO HOW WE PRIORITIZE AND. INVEST IN EDUCATION. FOR MEMBER OF ALL THE FOR THAT MAKE UP TO MAKE UP OF THE STATE. CLIMATE ADAPTATION. AND RECENTLY WE PUBLISHED ENACTED TO SOME CALLED THE STATE. ADAPTATION GUIDE THIS IS SOME THAT TO US THREE ALLEGE. I THINK I TWENTY. AND REQUIRES A TO LOOK AT THE STATE THAT A PATIENT STRATEGY AND MAKE SURE THAT WE- TOOL KIT IF YOU WILL. OUR COMMUNITY OF. AND CALLED TO BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE THE LATEST SCIENCE IN PLACE PLANNING TAKES. WHO CLIMATE ADAPTATION. PLANETS REALLY HOW TO. STOP BASED GUIDE FOR COMMUNITIES AS ONE EXAM- BUT SUFFICE TO SAY THAT CLIMATE CHANGE CLIMATE ADAPTATION IS. SOMETHING THAT IS AT THE FOREFRONT. OF OUR PLANNING STRATEGIES YOUR IT AND- YES AND- FOR BOTH RISK REDUCTION AS WELL AS FOR EMERGENCY PLANNING AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE. GOING FORWARD IS THAT IS THAT THERE'S A VICIOUS PERSON. SO WITH THAT THAT'S JUST REALLY A VERY HIGH LEVEL OVER AND OVER YOU THAT HOPEFULLY YEAH- ANSWERS SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS AND HAPPY TO ANSWER MORE AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES TO PERCENT. THE. DIFFERENCE BUDGET EITHER. THE NAME OF CHAIRMAN OF THE PUBLIC CORE OF. ONE WITH THAT HELLO YES AND I'M JUST GIVE YOU HIGH LEVEL OF SOME OF THE TALKS. PROPOSAL THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR BUDGET FOR CALLING WE- AND THEN WE HAVE- SOME OF OUR SUBJECT MATTER. EXPERTS IN THE ROOM I CAN HELP IT ANY. QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THE FIRST IN YOUR DONE THE LIKE HOW. DISTRICT THE THIRD. ACT WE REFERRED IT AS THE- WHAT DOES THE OF THE- THIS IS THE ACT THAT GIVES THE- DEPARTMENT THE AT. TO HAVE THE DISASTER ASSISTANCE PRORAM WHAT WE DO WITHOUT AS WE ADMINISTER THIS PROGRAM FOR THE LOCALS WHO AND- HAVE HAD- ZASTROW EVENTS THAT. LED TO. PROPERTY DAMAGE OR INFRASTRUCTURAL LOST AND WE ARE ABLE TO KIND OF USE THIS APPROPRIATION TO HELP EITHER PAY FOR SOME OF THE LOCAL COST OR TO HELP MEET FEDERAL MATCHES- FOR FEDERALLY DECLARED DISASTERS LIKE- THAT WOULD STILL BE MATH YOU HAD MENTIONED BEFORE. EVERY YEAR WE GO THROUGH AND WE LOOK AT WHAT THE LOCALS ARE ENTITLED TO OUR OWN FOR THEIR VARIOUS- DAMAGED. GOODS AND SERVICES AND THEN WHAT WE DO IS WE DO A PROJECTION OF HOW MUCH NEEDS TO GO OUT ON ANY GIVEN YEAR SO WE KIND OF LOOK AT IT BY FISCAL YEAR WHAT'S OWED FOR. EACH DISASTER EVENT THAT WE'RE THRILLED THAT BROKE- SO BORED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE HAD AN INITIAL PROPOSAL OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX POINT ONE MILLION WE HAVE A BASE BUDGET OF ABOUT SIXTY TWO POINT SIX MILLION. SO THE INCREASE IS REALLY RELATED TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS INCLUDING- COVETED RESPONSES LIKE THE GREAT PLAINS PROGRAM AND WHAT WAS ESTIMATED IN THE CURRENT NINETEEN ESTIMATE CHART THAT WAS PROVIDED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. IT ALSO HAS SOME RESERVE GIVEN THAT WE HAVE SOME CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY AND- AND- HEART. UNCERTAINTY OF THIS PANDEMIC SO WHAT WE DO IS WE WILL GO THROUGH AND DO ANOTHER UPDATE IN THE SPRING. TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT ANY OF THE- UPDATES THAT WE HAVE A GREAT ACOSTA CO THAT ANY NEW DISASTERS ANY PROJECT UPDATES OR ANY CHANGES TO THE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT SCHEDULE THAT WOULD AFFECT HOW MUCH IS NEEDED. FOR A LOCAL REIMBURSEMENT. BUT NEXT INCLUDED IN YOUR AGENDA IS THE- EARLY EARTH. WARNINGS INTO SIXTEEN. WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF INFO OF THE- TO BUILD OUT A PRO. THAT IS TO SUPPORT UP. AND OUTREACH CAMPAIGN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND TO EXPAND MEDICATION USES AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING PROGRAM- WE HAD SOME ONE TIME FUNDING PROVIDED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO THIS IS A REQUEST TO ASK FOR SEVENTEEN POINT THREE MILLION TO CONTINUE THE EXPANSION OF THE PROGRAM AND FINISH BUILDING OUT OF THE SYSTEM- THE NEXT. PROPOSAL IS THE NEXT GENERATION GRANT PROGRAM- THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS WE RECEIVED OR NOT THE PROGRAM BUT THE GRANTED STUFF WE RECEIVED A FEDERAL. YOUR OUR NINE ONE ONE SO THEY CALL IT NEXT GENERATION BASICALLY THE GREAT FUNDS ARE USED TO- EXPAND. HELPER NINE ONE ONE CALL DISPATCHERS USE DIGITAL INTERNET PROTOCOLS AND BROAD BASED THE NAVAL TECHNOLOGIES AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN COORDINATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE. BECAUSE THE FOR THE FEDERAL SOURCE WE WERE ABLE TO ENCUMBER OR MAKE A PROMISE OR COMMITMENT FOR ALL OF OUR LOCAL SUBSISTENCE GRANTS THAT ARE OUT IN THE FIELD HOWEVER WE STILL NEED SOME EXTRA SUPPORT AT THE STATE LEVEL TO ENSURE THAT WERE- MAKE MOVES THAT WE'RE MAKING ALL OF OUR- MEETING ALL OF OUR COMMITMENTS- FOR THE MONITORING OF THE PROGRAM THE USE OF THE FUNDS SO THIS IS JUST A REQUEST TO EXTEND FOR ANOTHER YEAR. THE USE OF THOSE. MONIES AT THE STATE LEVEL. THE FINAL. THAT YOU HAVE- I THINK THAT IS THE PROPOSED. SO THERE'S A COUPLE OTHER PAPA THE NINE- I THINK THE LATER OUT FAIRLY WELL THERE SOME- ONE TIME. THE. FOR- THE FIRST. AS WELL AS PROPERTY OUTLAY AND- PROJECTS I'M I'M NOT GONNA BELABORED BUT WE DO HAVE A THE X. IN THE ROOM IF YOU HAVE ANY. PROGRAM ON THE- OF THE OTHER PROJECTS. OH WAIT I GOODNESS ONE SORRY THE REGIONAL HAS MANY. BY SO THE REASON HAPPEN THIS MATURE RISK. THE PROGRAM THAT WAS. IN TWENTY. WE RECEIVED PERMANENT POSITIONS IN SOME LIMITED TERM FUNDING. FOR THIS PROGRAM THAT REALLY IS THE SUPPORT OF SUCH A HAZARDOUS MATERIAL RESPONSE CAPABILITIES TO LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS- WHICH ARE NOT WHICH THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY EQUIPPED TO FIND. SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR THE CONTINUATION OF THAT PROGRAM AND NOT REQUESTED FOR THREE SIX. THREE POINT SIX MILLION. AND I THOUGHT I WILL OPEN UP TO ANY QUESTIONS OR IF THERE'S- ANY PROGRAM DETAILS THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO OKAY ON. THANK BEFORE I OPENED AN UP TO PAY OF HAVE ANY FROM. TRUE SORT OF BORED LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE DID NOT RAISE ANY CONCERNS WITH THESE PROPOSALS. THANK YOU AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I ENDED UP THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING ELSE TO ADD THANK YOU. THANK YOU I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS A PERSON'S ABOUT THE EARLY EARTHQUAKE WARNING SYSTEM I KNOW THAT YOU'RE FINISHING UP A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS REPORT. DO YOU HAVE AN APPROXIMATE APPROXIMATE APPROXIMATION OF WHEN THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE. THANK YOU YEAH YOU DIRECTOR PLANNING PREPAREDNESS AND PREVENTION- YES WE ARE FINALIZING THAT- WE HAVE BEEN NOT. TRYING TO DO THAT IN TANDEM WITH A LOT OF OUR- OKAY NINETEEN AND VACCINE OPERATIONS ARE- AND WE ARE CLOSE TO FINALIZING DON'T HAVE A CERTAIN FOR YOU AT THIS TIME. OKAY AND THEN DO WE HAVE ANY ESTIMATIONS OF WHEN WE WHEN WE DO GET THE FINAL PROPOSAL HOW IT'S GOING TO BE FUNDED LONG TERM. THAT IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WORKING ON- WE'VE LOOKED INTO A COUPLE POSSIBILITIES I WORK FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER IN A PROPOSAL FOR YOU- AND- I HAVE AGAIN HAVE NO DATE CERTAIN ON WHEN WE WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT FOR YOU. T. APPROXIMATE THAT THE SUMP MIGHT BE AVAILABLE BEFORE THE MAY REVISE OR AFTER THE MAY REVIVE. I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT- I DON'T KNOW IF THERE HAS ANY FOLLOW UP ON THAT. OKAY YOU CAN FOLLOW OF DOLLARS UP. YOU CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOU LATER SO YOU CAN. THIS IS HEATHER CARLSON- AGAIN WE'RE WORK TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PART OF FINANCE AND LOOKING FOR OTHER VIABLE FUND SOURCES FOR- THE ONGOING COMMITMENT FOR THIS PROGRAM. OKAY I LOOK FORWARD TO SOME INFORMATION- DOWN DOWN THE ROAD I KNOW THE ONGOING DISCUSSION AND- WERE HAVING TO MANAGE- THE ONGOING EMERGENCIES. PLUS THE CONTINUED OR IF YOU WERE ALREADY DOING- BUT I DO I DO HOPE WE GET THAT INFORMATION IN THE NEAR FUTURE. MY SECOND QUESTION IS. ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE RISK REDUCTION AND MITIGATION I'M HIDING THAT YOU'RE DOING SPECIFICALLY GET AROUND OUR- MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. AND YOU HAVE EXPERTISE I HAVE FOR EXAMPLE I HAVE NINE SMALL CITIES. OF THAT OUR CONTRACT CITIES AND SO THAT I HAVE A LOT OF THEIR OWN EXPERTISE AND- UNLESS THAT THEY'RE ALWAYS PLANNING AHEAD. AND THEN THERE IS MITIGATION- OUT THERE AND SO ARE THERE WAYS IN WHICH YOU'RE WORKING WITH THESE SMALLER CITIES YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE THE ABILITIES TO BE RE REDUCING RISK THE MITIGATION. SO THAT WHEN WE DO HAVE AN EMERGENCY WE'RE BETTER PREPARED AND- IT'S LESS COSTLY OR YOUR JOB IS A LITTLE BIT EASIER. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION CAN A CURRY AGAIN FROM HELLO YES AND- WE ARE NOT VERY HARD TO MITIGATION PLAN I MENTIONED IDENTIFIED- UNITY VULNERABILITIES BOTH BY DISASTER RISK AND ALSO SOCIO ECONOMIC. VULNERABILITY THROUGHOUT THE WE HAVE THAT AS A MEMBER BASS LINE PLANNING pGREATEST NEEDS ARE. AND WE HAVE A TEAM OF ABOUT FOLKS THAT WHOSE JOB IT IS TO. WORK WITH COMMUNITIES TO THEIR OUT REACH IT IS CHALLENGING AS YOU MENTIONED FOR COMMUNITIES TO BE READY FOR YOU KNOW THE NINETIES BRANDS CAN BE COMPLEX. REALLY HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE LINE UP IN ORDER TO. DO TO BE ABLE TO ADD YOUR TAKE THE FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND THEM SO THAT IS A BIG FOCUS OF. EFFORT OF OURS AND I KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS MORE THAT WE COULD DO. AND CERTAINLY IF THEY WERE- CERTAIN SPECIFIC. IMMUNITY HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT OR THAT HAVE YOU KNOW IDEAS OR THINGS ARE LIKELY TO BE FUNDED WE CAN WORK WITH ME. ON THOSE DETAILS AND FOLLOW UP ON THAT SPECIFIC ABOUT. WHAT WE CAN. YEAH I MEAN IT IS THINK IN GENERAL AND A WE SEE IT WITH THE- OR NOW SIR COMMUTER. ARE WE HAD WE WERE TALKING A EQUITY INSERTING. ARE BEING HIT HARDER AND ARE. ARE DEALING WITH ITS WITH THE CAR. A LITTLE BIT HARD AND IT'S BEEN A FOR THEM MOVE FOR TO MAKE PROGRESS. NOT BECAUSE THE PANDEMIC HAS CREATED THIS INEQUITIES BUT- BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THEY BELONG ROOTED AND SO. I'VE I'VE THESE MOMENTS PROVIDE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMEMBER THAT THERE'S WORK WE COULD BE DOING AHEAD OF TIME AND- SOMETIMES I KNOW WE NEED A HOPPER SOUTHEAST COMMUNITY SENSE AS WE NEED FOLKS TO HELP US. OF BE BE READY FOR THAT YOU READY FOR THAT MOMENT- AS WELL AND SO. YOU KNOW JUST AS WE LOOK AT OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WHETHER IS TO THE- HEALTHY COMMUNITY INDEX OR THAT THE CALAVERAS WIENER. I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW OFTENTIMES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR NON COMMUNITIES I HAPPEN TO REPRESENT. A CHUNK OF THOSE L. A. COUNTY BUT I'M NOT THE ONLY AREA RIGHT SO WHAT I WOULD WANT TO ADVOCATE FOR MY DISTRICT BY WITH AFFAIR AND- JUST KIND OF IN GENERAL THESE COMMUNITIES ARE. ARE IMPORTANT AS WE'RE LOOKING AT. ONE OF THE COMMUNITIES ON THE ROAD WITH CLIMATE CHANGE. I IN PARTICULAR AS WE THINK ABOUT THE- BOTH THE HEAT ISLAND EFFECT OR THE FACT THAT THESE TOXIC SKIP BAKED AND BECOME MORE TOXIC- DURING THESE. HIGH HEAT MOMENTS THAT ARE RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE UP AND. SO- IN THE FUTURE WHICH IS TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND ON THAT THIS GUY. THANK YOU FOR THAT THE- RIGHT OUT WITH THAT I'M GONNA HAVE TO OVER TO MICHAEL- MY BUT A LOT IS. HI THANK YOU SO MUCH- FOR SPEAKING ON THESE TODAY. MY QUESTIONS ARE ACTUALLY ARE ACTUALLY AS MISS CURRY REFERENCE EARLIER WILDFIRE SEASON- IS JUST THAT IT'S THE SEASON THAT DOESN'T END AND THE IMPACTS WE HAVE SEEN IN OUR COMMUNITIES. OVER THE PAST YEARS IS GROWING AND PART OF THE MITIGATION EFFORTS INCLUDE PS PS EVENTS- WHICH IN MY COMMUNITY SEEM TO HAPPEN VERY FREQUENTLY. AND MY QUESTION- COOLEY FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS HELLO YES HAS ADMINISTERED OVER. A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION TO HELP COMMUNITIES MITIGATE THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS. OF POWER OUTAGES SO I WAS PARTICULARLY FRUSTRATED AND ACTUALLY UPSET TO SEE THAT AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUT BUDGET. HE ELIMINATED GROUNDS- FOR SPECIAL DISTRICTS TRIBES BOMB AND CITIES TO. APPLY FOR THESE GRANTS AND- I'VE HEARD FROM SEVERAL DISTRICTS AND CITIES IN MY COMMUNITY- WHO SAY THAT THIS IS JUST A DROP IN THE BUCKET AND MY COMMUNITY. I HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE AFFECTED BY PS PS EVENTS EVENTS. AT N. IN. IN THE MOST THE MOST FRUSTRATING WAY AS A MATTER OF FACT I WAS- THERE WAS A FACEBOOK VIDEO OF A MAN AN INTERSECTION A DARK INTERSECTION ONE OF MY CITIES. AND SIX CARS BLEW PAST THIS DARK INTERSECTION BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T TELL ON THAT- THERE WAS A STOP LIKE THERE THAT WOULD TYPICALLY BE. ON IF THE POWER WAS ON AND THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT ACTUALLY IN IN THAT VIDEO THERE'S A HUGE NEED SO MIKE MY QUESTION IS. FROM IS TO CARILLO YES IS HOW MANY CITIES SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND TRIBES APPLIED FOR FUNDING AND WERE DENIED IN EITHER. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. OR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. THE CARD FOR THE CALORIE AS WE CAN GET THAT SPECIFIC INFORMATION BACK TO YOU WE DO HAVE IT I JUST DON'T HAVE IT AT MY- I THINK THAT. I WOULD BE THAT AND THEN MY NEXT QUESTION IS BOTH FOR. HELLO YES IN THE ALLEY LA JOH CLEARLY THERE'S A DEMAND FOR THESE FUNDS- I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHETHER ONLY AFTER THE ALLEY- BELIEVES RESTORING THESE FUNDS WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO ENSURING. THE PREPAREDNESS OF THESE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AGAINST PF PF EVENTS. SORT OF BORED LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. ON V. P. S. P. S. FUNDS PROVIDED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABOUT CERTAINLY MORE. ENABLE THEM TO- BETTER RESPOND TO THESE POWER SHUT DOWN EVENTS OVER THE LEGISLATURE WILL NEED TO EVALUATE. THAT AGAINST ITS OTHER GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES EITHER DECIDES HOW MUCH FUNDING. RIGHT IN THIS AREA. HELLO YES. THE OTHER WAY WE CONTINUE TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF. BUT THE GOVERNMENT WE'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR AND I'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THAT I'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT THERE'S A REASON WHY- THAT THIS WAS CUT OUT OF THE BUDGET THIS YEAR BUT IT ELIMINATED- WANTED SOMETHING THAT IS GROWING IN FREQUENCY. NOT DIMINISHING. HI THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER I ENDED UP THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SOMEONE TWENTY NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE MILLION WAS PROVIDED ON A ONE TIME BASIS- AGAIN IN TWENTY TWENTY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- FIFTEEN ON GENERAL FUND WHICH PROVIDE ONE TIME- AS YOU KNOW. FUNDING WAS NOT PROPOSES THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE DO CONTINUE TO TRACK THE IMPACTS OF BEST BE DISPENSING AND ACTIONS TAKEN BY A UTILITIES AND LOCAL ENTITIES- ALSO ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING DILIGENTLY TO GET THE- REMAINDER OF THE FUNDING. OUT MAKE SURE THAT WE KNOW. WHERE IT'S GOING AND- MAKING SURE IT'S IMPACTFUL. WITH A VERY SEPARATE SACRAMENTO PROGRESS INITIATION ADDED- DETERMINATION NOT TO. PROPOSE ADDITIONAL PREPARATIONS AT THIS TIME FOR ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY START. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THANK YOU. IS THE DANCER. HI ACTUALLY THIS IS VERY FAMILIAR TO ME- AND BEFORE COMING TO LEGISLATURE I WAS OF FLOOR WARDEN COMMUNITY COORDINATOR BILL EMERGED COORDINATOR AND EMERGENCY PERNICE COORDINATOR FOR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND MY QUESTION IS REALLY ABOUT THAT THE KIND OF DOVETAILS WITH THE TWO CHAIRMEN WOMAN IS TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU GET COMMUNITIES PREPARED FOR DISASTERS AND I REMEMBER THE DISASTER ACTION PLANS. ANDY THE FORWARD MANUALS IN THE BUILDING MERGING PREPAREDNESS COORDINATOR MANUALS- IN NINETEEN NINETY THEY DID NOT HAVE THINGS LIKE CIVIL UNREST. IN NINETEEN NINETY THEY DID NOT HAVE THINGS LIKE WILDFIRES THEY DID HAVE PARAGRAPHS ABOUT IT BUT IT WAS A PARAGRAPH. I'M PRETTY SURE IS PAGES AND PAGES AND PAGES OF COLLEGE THERE. NOW WE'RE IN A PANDEMIC. AND WE HAVE TO ADJUST AND I KNOW MORTON PROBABLY BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE YOU CAN ALWAYS PLAN. FOR A MAJOR DISASTER BUT YOU NEED TO ADAPT- FOR EXAMPLE WE WORKED ON. ON THE WHITTIER EARTHQUAKE AND SEVERAL OTHER IT GRAYSON WINNER NORTHRIDGE HER HAPPEN EARTHQUAKE HAPPENED IN LOS ANGELES WE'RE BETTER EQUIPPED AT HANDLING IT AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THAT DISASTER FAIRLY QUICKLY BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE. AND SO. I JUST WANNA KNOW THAT WHOLE IT WAS LIKE A WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE OF TRAINING CITIES OR HOW TO DEAL WITH DISASTERS WE HAD A TRAINING CENTER I BELIEVE NEAR SAN LUIS OBISPO. AND I EVEN WENT TO THE TO THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY TRAINING CENTER IN EMMITSBURG- MARYLAND I'M NOT SUE IF THEY'RE STILL THERE. MY AGE IS PROBABLY PRE DATING MAN WHAT WAS GOING ON SO I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW. DO WE STILL. HAVE OR DO WE STILL REQUIRE. LOW MINISTER. TO CREATE DISASTER PLANS DECREASED DISASTER MANUALS TO BE READY FOR JUST ABOUT ANYTHING BECAUSE WHO KNEW ABOUT A PANDEMIC. M. AND BEING A WOULD BE PREPARED TO HANDLE THAT AND ON TOP OF THAT- I'M SO YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF GRANTS AND MONEYS- I WAS IN CHARGE OF ENSURING THAT. THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES NOW ONLY GOT MONEY BACK FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO FOR STATE GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY FILLED OUT. THESE FORMS FOR STATE GRANTS ACTUALLY FILLED OUT- FORMS TO GET. IT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND I THINK I DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB WE NEVER HAD TO BORROW MONEY. TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THIS NOW IT SEEMS. LIKE A LOT OF MUNICIPALITIES. EITHER NOT GETTING THEIR MONEY'S BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TRAINED WITHIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE OR THERE'S A DELAY. OR THEY JUST MISS. BEING ABLE TO APPLY FOR IT ALTOGETHER BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE PEOPLE THERE. THAT KNOW HOW TO GET MONEY BACK FROM FEMA. AND SO I. THE STATE USED TO BE PRETTY GOOD AT ENSURING THAT WE HAD PEOPLE IN EVERY MUNICIPALITY THAT WAS TRAINED TO DO THAT I THINK WE EVEN. THERE WAS EVEN A LAW THAT MADE IT A REQUIREMENT THAT WE HAD AT THIS INFRASTRUCTURE AND- AND SO I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS BECAUSE I'M I'M I GET THE FEELING THAT MAY BE BUDGET CUTS. THAT THAT'S BEEN DECIMATED AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE ANYMORE AND I COULD BE WRONG AGAIN I HAVEN'T. I'VE BEEN IN EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS COORDINATOR SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR. WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY MAJOR DISASTERS AND MIKE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR BUT THAT'S A- I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT WHAT THE WHAT IS THAT INFRASTRUCTURE STILL THERE DOESN'T EXIST WHAT ARE WE DOING. THANK YOU SIR FOR THAT EXCELLENT QUESTIONS AND- THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE IN. OUR NEXT SO.

OKAY AND THERE OTHER THAT OBVIOUSLY ARE COMING TO THE TOP OF MY MIND BUT- I THINK IT DO READ YOU THAT IS STILL IN. AND. THE LOCAL. ARE OUR WORK IT AND THEY ARE AT APPLYING FOR.

THIS COMMITTEE SOME SUGGEST. ON HOW WE ALSO AN- THANK I DO REMEMBER IN NINETY. THE TALK ABOUT RICE LIKE ONE. NOW I WOULD THAT PLAN. S. PRE. OF THAT AND I REMEMBER ABOUT DISEASE OR PANDEMIC.

WERE WOULD BE TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER WITH MASS ON VACCINATIONS WORLDWIDE- AND HOW AND TRY TO PLAN FOR HOW TO DO THAT- PEOPLE PROBABLY HAVE LAUGHED YOU OUT OF THE ROOM BACK THEN AND IT IS A VERY REAL THING AND SO I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. THAT WE GET OUT OF OUR OWN WAY AND PICK OUT OF THE BOX ON HOW WE DO THOSE AND WE NEED TO BOLSTER THAT INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT WE'RE BETTER ADEPT AT A- THE DEALING WITH THE LADIES UNKNOWNS.AND THEN MY OTHER QUESTION IS JUST ABOUT.

TO DO THE WORK AHEAD OF TIME WHEN WORST WE HAVE A FORTY EIGHT OUT BY THE TIME IT GETS TO THE COMMUNITY GROUPS THAT ARE HELPING WE HAVE BETWEEN TWENTY FOUR TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS TO SIGN UP. A HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE AT THE SITE. I AND I KNOW WHEN AN EMERGENCY SO I KNOW THAT PLANNING ISN'T ALWAYS POSSIBLE BUT YOU KNOW THE VACCINE PRICES GONNA TAKE A LITTLE WHILE AT THE RATE WE'RE GOING IS THERE ANY WAY TO PRESS OUR ABILITY FIFTH PLAN. MORE THAN A WEEK AHEAD OF TIME. I SO GREAT QUESTION AND ONE THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON AND HERE IS WHERE WE STAND TODAY. WE HAVE. TO WELL POOR TOO MANY FLOW EACH COUNTY.

WHERE ABOUT TWO WEEKS OUT IN OUR SCHEDULING SO- WE HAVE HEARD AS YOU HAVE AT THAT OUR- HEROES ON THE GROUND NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE LEAD TIME TO DO THE OUTREACH SO. WE ARE ABOUT TWO WEEKS OUT IN THE SCHEDULING FOR THOSE. AND THEN IN THE LIST OF MANY STATE AGENCIES THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH AND I DO APPRECIATE ALL OF OUR STATE EMPLOYEES BOTH AT A CALLAWAY YES AND THE MANY AGENCIES. WHO ARE STEPPING UP AND LIKE THE GOVERNOR SAYS TO ME THE MOMENT OUT THERE BUT IN IN THAT I DIDN'T HEAR ANY COLLABORATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE. ARE INFORMATION SHARING WITH THE INFORMATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE IS THAT. AN ACCIDENT IS THAT ON PURPOSE OR KIND OF WHAT'S GOING ON THERE- I DIDN'T. I DIDN'T MENTION THAT COLLABORATION IS GOING ON WITH THE- THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE IT'S NOT OPERATIONAL IN NATURE BUT THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION SHARING THAT IT'S GOING ON- WE HAVE. TWICE WEEKLY MEETING- WITH THE LEGISLATURE WHICH WE REPORT OUT ON ALL THE-VACCINE OPERATIONS AND TAKE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS- MORE ACTION. AND THEN I BELIEVE THERE'S A OF LEGISLATIVE MAKING GRIFFITH ALL FOR AND MEETING REGULARLY AND WE'RE PROVIDING. TO THEM ON A REGULAR. WITH ALL ALL GET TO POINT OF THESE I EIGHT REP. HALF OF SOUTH L. A. COUNTY SURE THAT WITH THE SPEAKER. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE VACCINATION RATES WE ARE IN THE BOTTOM OF WE HAVE ABOUT ONE IN TWENTY PEOPLE WHO ARE VACCINATED AT THE LAST DATA POINTS BUT OUR INFECTION RATES ARE THAT'S RIGHT OUR HOUSE BOTH A SINCE THE RATES ARE REALLY. HIGH I KEEP REFERRING TO MY- MY RECEIPTS. FOR THE DATA OUT THERE WE LOOK AT COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. AND THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN ORGANIZING ON THE GROUND WITH THE PHILIP COLLABORATIVE AND OF NOW THE MOBILE SITE THAT WE HAVE- IN SOUTH GATE WELL WE HAVE LOTS OF DIFFERENT PIECES TALKING WE WEREN'T ALL TALKING TO EACH OTHER- PEOPLE WERE GETTING BLOWN UP IN DIFFERENT CAPACITIES- AND- A LOT OF FRUSTRATION ON THE GROUND A LOT OF MISINFORMATION. CLEANING FOR MYSELF I HAD TO SPEND MULTIPLE DAYS NOT JUST MY STAFF OF MYSELF MAKING PHONE CALLS TO SAY WHAT'S GOING ON HERE AND GETTING YELLED AT BY PEOPLE WHEN I WOULD CALL TO ASK HIM WHAT'S GOING ON BECAUSE THEY WERE SO FRUSTRATED- AND IN THIS MOMENT OUT THERE AND SO. I WOULD SAY FOR MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUES WE ARE HERE TO BE OF SERVICE IN BE OF HELP AND SUPPLEMENT THE EFFORTS THAT YOU ARE DOING- BOTH THROUGH THE STATE AND IN COLLABORATION WITH THE WITH P. MINE WITH THE COUNTY- BUT WE DO NEED TO IMPROVE THAT COMMUNICATIO. A LITTLE BIT MORE I AM VERY APPRECIATIVE FOR THE SITE THAT IS IN SOUTH GATE THERE ARE ABOUT A DOZEN CITIES IN SOUTHEAST L. A. COUNTY AND THEY'VE DECIDED TO WORK TOGETHER TO RACE TO THE END. AND APPRECIATE OVER WHEREVER THE SITE'S SLAMMED IN THEIR COMMUNITY BUT WE HAVE NOW THIS COVER THAT WITHOUT THAT ANTICIPATION AHEAD OF TIME IT'S HARD TO PLAN AHEAD AS WE'RE TRYING TO DO EDUCATION. TRYING TO GET THROUGH THE INSIDE OF THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVE THE DISTRUST- AND THE AND IF YOU'RE AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT EEDS TO GO INTO CONVINCING SOMEONE TO HAVE A TO GET A VACCINE. AND THE COMMUNITY I SPENT SUNDAY ALL OF THEM THE OTHER DAY. DRIVING AROUND THIS WEEKEND LOOKING FOR VENDORS. WHO ARE VERY- AND SHOULD BE BACK FROM. AND OTHER THEM HAD EVER GOT BACK FROM THE AND WE'RE- I THINK BILLION NUMBER THE SAME UP- AND ARE GOING TO BE SHOWING UP. ON TUESDAY IN IN SOUTH GATE- BUT I WOULD JUST WHEREVER POSSIBLE AS WE ARE REFINING THIS PROCESS. IN ALL FAIRNESS WE ARE ONLY A MONTH INTO THIS. AND SO I REALIZED. THAT WILLIAM WENT INTO THIS BUT WE ARE YEAR INTO THE PANDEMIC WHEN YOU'RE A VACCINE WAS COMING. ON AND SO AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN WE NEED TO IMPROVE THIS PROCESS. SO THAT WE CAN BACK TO MEET AS MANY PEOPLE IN THESE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HIGHLY AFFECTED EVER REALLY WANNA BE NONE THE CURVE AND BE EQUITABLE AND SO. I JUST YOU KNOW WHEREVER YOU CAN GO BEYOND- BEYOND THE GROUP THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY I WAS IN THE EGISLATURE TO TALK TO THE MEMBERS WHO ARE REPRESENTING THESE HIGHLY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES- AND FORTUNATELY. WITH EVERYTHING IS INTERESTING THAT WE'RE GETTING THAT INFORMATION EITHER AND WHAT'S GOING ON UNTIL WE HAVING TO PIECE IT TOGETHER SO. WOULD APPRECIATE THAT INFORMATION I HOPE AT SOME POINT WERE ABLE TO GET. PAST THIS DIANNE CALOPHYLLACEAE IT INTO MORE THESE MOBILE CLINICS IN THE COMMUNITY- IN SOUTH GATE THERE WERE A LOT OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWING UP. WANTING TO GET VACCINATED OR NOT SIGNED UP AND WE'RE TAKING A MOMENT TO SIGN UP FOR A FUTURE. OF APPOINTMENT OF FOR A FUTURE DATE. BUT IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE WHEN IT'S IN YOUR BACKYARD AND A TRUSTED SOURCE LIKE YOU SAID A CHURCH OR A PARK. AND SO WHAT WE NEED TO PLAN AHEAD IT'S HARD TO HAVE THE MOVING AROUND- IT'S HELPFUL IF THE MOVES BEYOND THE CITY FLVS IS TRYING TO MAKE ITS WAY THROUGH THIS REGION THAT'S BEEN SO. HIGHLY IMPACTED IN FRONT OF ESTIMATED. ALONG THE WAY AND SO. WE ARE HERE TO BE OF SERVICE TO BE PARTNERS- I DO APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS AND- I WILL SAY JUST IN THE LAST FIVE DAYS A SEEN. CALLAWAY IS WORKING LONG HOURS WITH US. IF THEY BY PHONE FOR THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND IMPROVING THEIR OPERATIONS REGULARLY AND TRYING TO TAKE ADVICE FROM THE WILL. OF GROUPS-ON THE GROUND.

WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING TO BE SEC ON VARIOUS BUDGET PROPOSALS. WE WILL GO AHEAD AND LET THE PANELISTS BEGAN AND THEY CAN GO IN THE ORDER. LISTED IN THE AGENDA. HE GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M KATIE HOWARD THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS CAN YOU HEAR ME OK. YES RIGHT THANK YOU- AND YOU'D LIKE ME TO JUST JUMP RIGHT INTO THE TITLE TO ITEM CORRECT. CORRECT OKAY THANK YOU I'M AS IS DESCRIBED IN THE AGENDA THIS IS- A PROPOSAL TO INCREASE THE BOARDS ARE SPENDING AUTHORITY FOR A GRANT THAT IS ADMINISTERED UNDER TITLE TWO WHICH IS A FEDERAL LAW HAVING TO DO WITH JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION- AND THIS. PROPOSAL DOES NOT AFFECT THE GENERAL FUND THESE WOULD BE- THIS WOULD BE A CHANGE THAT WOULD ALLOW THE BOARD TO HAVE ACCESS TO MORE FEDERAL DOLLARS FOR AN IMPORTANT PROJECT THAT OUR STATE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION HAS PLANNED- AND THAT IS A PROPOSAL TO HAVE A CONSULTANT DO SOME WORK CONNECTED WITH. REDUCING RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN COUNTY JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEMS- A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL IS LAID OUT IN THE AGENDA AND I'M VERY HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE BUT THIS IS A REALLY SIMPLE- PROPOSAL JUST TO ALLOW US TO GET ACCESS TO THOSE DOLLARS. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I MEAN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE HAVE NO COMMENT ON THIS PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. L. A. L. AT. YOU KNOW WHAT THE L. A. OKAY WE DIDN'T RAISE ANY CONCERNS ON THIS PROPOSAL. FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. NO ONE SECOND. TO BUDGET. I APOLOGIZE THERE'S TWO BUDGET PROPOSAL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WILL YOU BE SPEAKING ON THE FIRST ONE. OR THE SECOND ONE I ASK. QUESTION WITH REGARDING THE FIRST PROPOSAL- GOOD AFTERNOON CHARACENE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JUSTIN EVAN AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I WILL PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW. OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO AMEND THE SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT FORMULA. AT THE LEGISLATURE DESIGNED SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT PROGRAM THE TWO PURPOSES ONE CAN ONLY BE STATE PRISON OVERCROWDING. TO STATE STATE GENERAL FUND MONEY. I THESE ARE ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT COMPROMISING PUBLIC SAFETY BY ENCOURAGING COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT USED EVIDENCE BASED SUPERVISION PRACTICES. TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS ON FELONY SUPERVISION OR SENT TO STATE PRISONS. SB SIX SEVENTY GRANT FORMULA INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL. LAST YEAR HE PROVIDED A HUNDRED AND TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO COUNTY FOR ITS PURPOSE. THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO MODIFY THE STATUTORY FORMULA FOR SB SIX SEVENTY EIGHT I MERELY DUE TO THE COMPLETE NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND ITS IMPACTS TO THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS COMMITTED TO STATE PRISONS IN TWENTY TWENTY. I THIS WOULD AMEND THE FORMULA PROVIDE A SET AMOUNT OF A HUNDRED TWENTY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION GENERAL FUND OR ABOUT TEN POINT THREE MILLION INCREASE OVER THE PRIOR YEAR FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. I THIS MONTH PROVIDES THE HIGHEST SB SIX SEVENTY EIGHT EACH COUNTY OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS. I WAS GONNA GET A LITTLE TECHNICAL HERE THANK COLLEGE EYES BUT THE FUNDS ARE PREDICATED ON THREE COMPONENTS THE FIRST EXACT COUNT TO PRISON READS FOR THE REPLICATION RATE WHICH IS DETERMINED BY HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS ON FELONY SUPERVISION. ARE SENT OUT OF THE COUNTY SEVENTY TWO PROVISION POPULATION. OF A SECOND COMPARE COMPONENT IS A COMPARISON OF EACH COUNTIES RETURNED TO PRISON RATE AND IT'S RATE IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR. AT THIS IS PRIMARILY THE INCENTIVE COMPONENT AND IT'S COMPARING YEAR TO YEAR DATA PROVIDED ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO COUNTIES THE SEND YOU WERE INDIVIDUALS TO PRISON FROM FANTASY PREVENTION. AND THEY DIDN'T PREVIOUS YEAR SO THEY'RE DEMONSTRATING A SUCCESS AND THE INCENTIVIZE BACK THROUGH THIS COMPOUND. I THE THIRD COMPONENT PROVIDES A MINIMUM OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ALL COUNTIES THAT REPORT PROVISIONING REVOCATION DATA AS REQUIRED BY THE. LAW A CODE NINETEEN HIS SIGNIFICANT HIM. BY THE FIRST TO COMPLY THAT THE- FOR. IF YOU CAMPUS. AND THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AT THE STATE BY RECORD REQUEST REPLY SIX PER. IN ABOUT OUT SEVENTY PROBATION REVOCATION DIFFERENT. AND THAT RESULTED IN THE HUNDRED TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT. A ON DATA THAT WE RECEIVE FOR THIS SIX MONTHS OF. TWO ONLY ABOUT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. FOR A GROUP OF THE PRISON AND THE TRAIN SHOWS DOWNWARD. I'M ASKING YOU ONE ON. WE GETTING PAID ONLY FOUR FIVE. INDIVIDUAL WOULD BE. IMPRISONING YEAR TWENTY. WHICH WOULD RESULT IN OF ABOUT A EIGHTY SIX NO DOLLARS- UNDER THE- FORMULA. BECAUSE OF THAT WE BELIEVE OFTEN IN AND BASED THE STORY TREND IS REASONABLE. YOU THE IMPACT THAT THAT. ON PRISON. AND CONNECT. ARE FINALLY I WANT TO NOTE THIS. IS AN TO BE A TEMPORARY. I THERE ARE OTHER. JUSTICE FOR MEASURES SUCH AS EIGHTY NINETEEN FIFTY. INTRODUCED INTEGRATION OF MOST PROBATION TERMS WHICH ALSO WILL IMPACT THE EXISTING FORMULA. ARE THESE VARIOUS FACTORS ARE GOING TO REQUIRE FUTURE MODIFICATION OF THE EXISTING FORMULA. MAINTAIN THE GOAL SB SIX SEVENTY AND INCENTIVIZING THE WORK OF COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT'S. IN MINIMIZING CALIFORNIA'S PRISON POPULATION AND MAINTAINING PUBLIC SAFETY. I WOULD. MORE THAN HAPPY. TO TAKE ANY NUMBER QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT. ON THE L. A. O. HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD TO THAT. THANK YOU R. O. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. IN ADDITION TO THE INPUT BOX FROM THE PANDEMIC ON THE REPLICATION RATE IN THE SUPERVISION NO WAY OUT. FINANCES ALSO NOTE THAT SOME RECENT POLICY CHANGES WILL ALSO LIKELY. SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT AWARDS. FIRST AS PART OF THE COMPANY TEAM TO CAN START AT LEAST THE PEOPLE FROM PRESENTED SOME OF THOSE GOING ON. TO AS YOU PROVISION BY CONCORD OF. AT INDIVIDUALS CAN TOWARDS THAT SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT FOUR OF THE BEST IN WHAT THAT- SILVA FOUGHT THROUGH. AND THESE PEOPLE THIS HOW SUPPORT. OF THE POPULATIONS OF THIS INCREASED BY COULD HAPPEN IN ON THE- RATE GOING- AND TELL THE POPULATION RETURNS ALL OF. BECAUSE IT'S A PROVISION IN THE SECOND IMPACT IS A NINETY FIFTY WHICH. WE DO STILL HAVE THE TIME PEOPLE HER. THEN BECAUSE PEOPLE BECOME LESS TO BE SET TO PRISON OVER. THIS IN. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BUT LESS BE SENT TO PRESIDENT EXPLAINING PEOPLE GOVERNMENT RECOGNITION TO PRISON. AND THAT'S WHAT ALSO INCREASE THE LACK WEEK BECAUSE THE OFFICE SOMEONE WHO'S GONE SUPER AND FAILING GOING OR THAT COULD HAPPEN IF THE CASE IS WHAT FORMULA. THESE IMPACT ON COMPLETELY TO CONTROLLED COUNTY BOARD OF OUR- AND SO WE DO THINK IN A TO SIX ON EIGHT IS A PROGRAM AND THEN OUT. WE DO HAVE CONCERNS THAT THEY JUST COULD UNDERMINE INTENT AS THE SEVEN EIGHT IF IT IS MADE FOR PRIME. AN ASTRONAUT OUT OF. WOULD BE ON. SO WE ARE TO PUT THE HUNDRED ONE TIME BASIS AND THEN CORRECT THAT MISSED. RIGHT ALONG TERM. SB SIX EIGHT. IS THAT CORRECT THE LAST DOT BUT LISTS DIRECT DEPARTMENT I KNOW. TO PROVIDE LITTLE FROM PROTECTING US THE SIX SEVEN EIGHT FIVE YEAH TEND TWENTY. NINETY ONE A QUICK. THE ARE AT NOT THAT DEALING WITH YOUR COMMA UP FORMULA OR ABOUT THE- FOR MAKING THOSE ARE BUT- ALLOCATIONS. SB SIX SEVEN. FIVE WE CAN TWENTY TWENTY. WELL WHAT WE ARE ONE IN OUR- IS THAT THEY UP WITH A PLAN. HOW LONG. SOME OF INTO STRUCTURE THAT IS PART OF SB SIX. CURRENTLY GETS WHICH GOING. FOR AT THE MOMENT WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN FOR HOW LONG IT WOULD LAST- WE DO APPRECIATE. YOUR TIME. WE CAN'T. REACH CHANGES TO THE FARMING ARE NECESSARY BUT IT'S HARD TO TELL GIVEN THE CHANGES. SPECIFICALLY IS ALREADY GOING INTO TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO ONE ACTIONABLE DATA WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO DEVELOP A PLAN FOR NEXT YEAR BUT IN THE FUTURE WE ARE. OPEN TO. DRESSING THAT FORMULA. EXOTERIC CHANGES. I MEAN LET ME GO ON THE RECORD THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS MILLION. WITH GIVING THESE. OPEN ENDED ALLOCATIONS OR NOT HAVING A PLAN. LONG TERM AND CREATING A PRECEDENT- IN THIS SITUATION. AND SO. WHILE WE DO HAVE A PANDEMIC WE ARE FORCED TO MULTI TASK ON A REGULAR BASIS OUR TAXPAYERS. EXPECT THAT OF US AND SO I DOHOPE. THAT THE NEXT TIME WE MEET OUR AND IN THE FUTURE YOU'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE US WITH. SOME IDEA OF HOW LONG THIS WOULD GO ON FOR. AND FROM. SOME ESTIMATION. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON THIS ITEM. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND THEN IN THAT CASE WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO THE LAST- ISSUE ITEM NUMBER FIVE. WHERE AGAIN THE SEC IS GONNA GIVE US A REVIEW OF THE STATE STANDARDS AND INSPECTIONS FOR LOCAL DETENTION FACILITIES. AT WILL BEGIN WITH AN OVERVIEW FROM THE L. A. ON THE REPORT AND THEN OTHER PANELISTS WILL SPEAK IN THE ORDER LISTED IN THE AGENDA. AS BEGAN. OKAY I KNOW NEIL AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. I'VE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF OUR RECENT REPORT FINDING IT DC'S PROGRAM FOR SETTING STANDARDS FOR INSPECTING LOCAL DETENTION FACILITIES SUCH AS JAILS AND JUVENILE HALLS- I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT WHICH I'VE MEMBERS SHOULD I BELIEVE HI HAVE- AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE. FOLLOWING ALONG REMOTELY YOU CAN ACCESS IT VIA THE SENATE COMMITTEE'S WEBSITE UNDER THE- THE AGENDAS TAB OR FROM OUR WEBSITE AT LEóN DOT CA DOT. PUBLICATIONS THANK HANDOUT DESCRIBES IN BACKGROUND ON BST THIS IS YOUR FOR REFERENCE INTEREST OF TIME I AM GOING TO MOVE ON TO PAGE TWO I'M WHICH PROVIDES A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE LOCAL DETENTION FACILITIES STANDARDS AND INSPECTIONS PROGRAM WHICH IS ONE OF ONE OF THE SEC'S FOUR MAIN RESPONSIBILITIES AT ALL RELATE TO LOCAL CORRECTIONS. BE A FIFTY REQUIRED BY STATUTE TO. PERFORM THREE ACTIVITIES THREE PRIMARY ACTIVITIES THAT RELATED TO THIS PROGRAM. THE FIRST IS TO CONSIDERING REVISIONS TO THE STANDARD MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR THE OPERATION CONSTRUCTION OF LOCAL DETENTION FACILITIES. ONCE EVERY TWO YEARS TO INSPECT EACH FACILITY- ONCE EVERY TWO YEARS AND TO ISSUE VARIOUS REPORTS ON THE- FINDINGS OF. THESE INSPECTIONS. AND I ALSO KNOW THAT STATUTE DESN'T PROVIDE IN THE SEC WITH A MECHANISM TO ENFORCE THE STANDARDS. THREE EIGHTY PROVIDES A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF SOME MODIFICATIONS THAT THE FCC HAS BEEN MAKING TO THE PROGRAM OVER THE PAST YEAR IN RESPONSE TO A DIRECTIVE FROM THE GOVERNOR. I IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WON'T DETAIL THEM BUT- I WILL NOTE THAT GENERALLY WE THINK THEY SEEM LIKE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT- PROBABLY DON'T GO FAR ENOUGH- I KNOW EXPLAINED A LITTLE BIT MORE. INTERESTING COMMENTS BUT PRIMARILY- WHAT'S LACKING FROM THE EXISTING PROGRAM AND THE GOVERNOR'S. MEDICAL CARE DIRECTED AND- DEAD MODIFICATIONS AT THE DIRECTION. OF THE GOVERNOR. IS ADDRESSED ON PAGE FOR THE HAND OUT- WHICH IS WHERE WE INCLUDE OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE PROGRAM- pVERY SIMPLE- WHEN WE LOOK AT ANY PROGRAM WE ASK TWO QUESTIONS WHAT ARE THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM AND USING MEETING THOSE GOALS. AND IN THIS CASE WE FOUND THAT THERE IS NO CLEAR STATUTORY MISSION OR GOALS FOR THIS PROGRAM WHICH MAKES IT VERY. DIFFICULT TO ASSESS IF IT'S- SOMETHING IMPORTANT STATE FUNCTION AND TO CONTINUE TO EXIST- IF IT'S APPROPRIATELY STRUCTURED AND RESOURCED. I OR IF IT'S OPERATING EFFECTIVELY- IT ALSO GIVES FINISH DISCRETION TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE SEC AND HOW TO OPERATE THE PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY SAID AS I SAID EARLIER. I THANK YOU JUST REALLY REQUIRES THE SEC TO PERFORM REMAINING ACTIVITIES- BUT DOES NOT TELL ME IF YOU SEE HOW TO PERFORM THOSE ACTIVITIES SO FOR EXAMPLE. IF YOU SEE HAVE TO ISSUE CERTAIN REPORTS. BY EIGHT COULD CHOOSE AND WHETHER TO. WRITE THEM IN A MANNER THAT IS- YOU KNOW. INTENDED FOR FACILITY ADMINISTRATORS IF THE GOAL IS REALLY TO BE AN ASSET TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO. COUNTIES AND CITIES WHO OPERATE THESE FACILITIES OR IF I COULD WRITE IT IN A MANNER THAT'S VERY- ACCESSIBLE TO THE LAKE THE LAYPERSON IF THE GOAL IS TO. PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY. TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC- SO MOVING ON TO PAGE FIVE AND THE REST OF MY HAND OUT AND COMMENTS PERTAIN TO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS IN LIGHT OF THE FACT FINDING- AND JUST HAD A VERY HIGH LEVEL WE'VE THREE RECOMMENDATIONS THE FIRST IS TO SET A CLEAR MISSION AND GOALS FOR THE PROGRAM IN STATUTE THE SECOND IS TO ALIGN BOARD MEMBERSHIP WITH THAT MISSION AND GOALS AND THE THIRD IS TO REQUIRED THE SEC TO SUBMIT A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW IT WILL ALIGN THE PROGRAM WITH THAT MISSION GOALS. GOING INTO THOSE EACH- IN A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL FIRST WE HAVE AN ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COMMISSION AND GOALS NOW OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE COULD ESTABLISH ANY GOALS THAT IT IT SEEMS IT DEEMS APPROPRIATE FOR THE PROGRAM BUT WE DO RECOMMEND- A SPECIFIC MISSION- WHICH IS TO PROMOTE LEGAL HUMANE AND SAFE CONDITIONS- WHICH WE WOULD KNOW DOES NOT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE CURRENT INFORMAL- MISSION OF THE PROGRAM ALTHOUGH WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IT BE- CODIFIED GIVEN NOT A FUTURE ADMINISTRATION COULD ADOPT A DIFFERENT INFORMAL AND- MISSION. AND THEN WE RECOMMEND FOR SPECIFIC GOALS TO FURTHER THAT OVER ARCHING MISSION AND THOSE ARE ONE TO MAINTAIN STANDARDS THAT HELP LOCAL LEADERS DETERMINE AND MEET MEDICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DETENTION FACILITY CONDITIONS TO FACILITATE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH- STANDARDS. AND INSPECTIONS OF THESE FACILITIES. AT THREE REFORM EQUITABLE. OF THE HE AND SAFE CONDITION. WHEN FOR TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND STATEWIDE LEADERSHIP TO FACILITATE SYSTEMIC IMPROVEMENT IN LOCAL DETENTION FACILITY CONDITIONS. AND OUR SECOND GOAL THEY MENTIONED IS TO AFTER ESTABLISHING- IN STATUTE. ARCHITECT CONTAGION IF YOU IT'S AFTER STUMBLING CONDITIONING IN FACT YOU TO- ALIGNED BOARD MEMBERSHIP WITH THEM. AND WE pRECOMMENDATIONS ARE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS UNDER THAT. UMBRELLA- THE FIRST IS TO ADD MEMBERS NUMBERS WITH SPECIFIC- PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE IN EXTERNAL OVERSIGHT OF OR ADVOCACY SURROUNDING DETENTION CONDITIONS. AND THAT'S BECAUSE- THE B. THE BOARD CURRENTLY HAS SEVEN OF THE THIRTEEN- SLOTS ARE DESIGNATED FOR LEADERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FOR- BY MANAGE FACILITIES THAT ARE INSPECTED BY THE PROGRAM SO THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF EXPERTISE ON. OPERATIONS BUT THERE IS NO DESIGNATED SPOT FIRST- A PERSON WITH EXPERTISE IN OVERSIGHT AND GIVEN THIS IS ONE OF THE SEC'S FOR- CORP PROGRAMS WE THINK THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT I'M IN THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION HERE IS TO- BALANCE THAT APPOINTMENT AUTHORITIES BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE CURRENTLY THE GOVERNOR APPOINTS TEN OUT OF THIRTEEN MEMBERS AND THE LEGISLATURE. APPOINTS TO SO WE THINK HAVE A BETTER BALANCE THEIR WAY TO HELP FACILITATE. LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. AND MOVING ON TO THE PAGE SEVEN- WE HAVE HERE WE- THE- WE THIRD RECOMMENDATION WHICH IS TO REQUIRE BE SEC CEMENT PLAN TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR HOW IT WILL ALIGN THE PROGRAM AT THE PROGRAM WITH THE MISSION AND GOALS. AND WE THINK THAT HAVING THIS REPORT WOULD HELP THE LEGISLATURE SS- WHETHER FOR EXAMPLE STATUTORY CHANGES MIGHT BE REQUIRED TO CARRY OUT THIS ALIGNMENT OF THE PROGRAM BURKE PERHAPS WHETHER THE SEC WE NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO- AMONG THE PROGRAM WITH THE MISSION AND GOALS. AND TO GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PLAN WE RECOMMEND REQUIRING THAT THE SEC DESCRIBED IN THE PLAN- HOW OLD IS SHE FIVE KEY OUTCOMES. AND THOSE ARE ONE- ENSURING STANDARDS THAT ARE SUFFICIENTLY SPECIFIC AND- EXPLICITLY CONSIDER EQUITY- AND TO DO IT IS WE THINK THAT THE PROCESS BY WHICH STANDARDS ARE DEVELOPED OR REVISED NEEDS TO BE- CHANGE SOMEONE WHICH WE DETAIL IN THE REPORT. TO THE PLAN SHOULD INCLUDE CONSIDERATION OF- HOW THE SEC WILL DEVELOP HIGH QUALITY RISK BASED INSPECTION STRATEGY TO ENSURE PRESSING ISSUES ARE FOUND QUICKLY- THEN THE CHANGES THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS DIRECTED BECAUSE HE DIDN'T. YES YOU SEE TO MAKE CONTAINS SOME STEPS IN THAT DIRECTION BUT OUR RECOMMENDATION WOULD- TAKE BCC FURTHER- THREE SPECIFIC BENCHMARKS TO ENSURE THAT THE INSPECTIONS- PROVIDE. EFFECTIVELY PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY BY MAKING STATE MAKING IT CLEAR YOU KNOW HOW MUCH INFORMATION DIFFERENT INSPECTORS ARE. USING IN ORDER TO FORM THEIR CONCLUSIONS WHAT AND HOW THEY'RE INTERPRETING DIFFERENT- WORDS THAT MAYBE. THEY WERE OPEN TO INTERPRETATION TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE DROPPING THEM IN THE SAME WAY- FOUR WE HAVE- WE HAVE VARIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS. REGARDING HOW THE SEC THE FCC SHOULD EXPLAIN- CHANGES. ARE PLANNED FOR CHECK CHANGES TO ITS REPORT THING PRACTICES AND POTENTIALLY STATUTORY REPORTING REQUIREMENT CHANGES TO ENSURE THAT THE REPORTS ARE ACCESSIBLE TO LAY AUDIENCES. PROVIDE USEFUL- INFORMATION FOR IDENTIFYING TRENDS AND SYSTEMIC ISSUES ETCETERA AND FINALLY- THE PLAN SHOULD GIVE CONSIDERATION TO PROVIDING LONGER TERM TECH A MORE COMPLEX TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO. A FACILITY SO THAT. THEY CAN. ADDRESS BARRIERS TO COMPLIANCE THAT MAYBE MORE SYSTEMIC IN NATURE AND TAKING LONGER THAN. THAN THE CURRENT SIXTY DAY COMPLIANCE TO ADDRESS AS WELL CONSIDER OF BSE CAN HIGH PROMISING. AND FACILITATE. IN PERSON- SO THAT'S THE END OF MY BRIEF OVERVIEW AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE COMMENTS THAT THAT WERE QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. I THINK YOU WERE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE DIFFERENT PANELISTS AT THIS POINT AND IF YOU COULD PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME- WE NEED THE LEVEL IN THE ORDER IN THE AGENDA. MEDICARE THIS IS KATIE HOWARD THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE BSE SCENE- WITH YOUR PERMISSION I'D LIKE TO ASK OUR BOARD CHAIR TO SPEAK FIRST AND THEN I'LL FOLLOW HER COMMENTS. THAT'S FINE. I THINK I'M ON. YOU'RE ON AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR- AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY I AM LINDA PENNER I CHAIR THE B. S. YOU SEE AND I AM- LOOKING FORWARD TO GIVING YOU SOME THOUGHTS AND RESPONSES TO THE L. A. O. REPORT. FIRST OFF- I WANT TO SAY IT'S USEFUL TO HAVE REPORTED RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE OPPORTUNITY DISCUSS THAT WITH YOU WELL WE HAVE PROVIDED YOU A ONE PAGE SUMMARY ABOUT- THE BSE SEES RESPONSIBILITY FOR INSPECTING JAILS AND JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES AND AS YOU SEE THE PENAL CODE SETS FORTH THE REQUIREMENT TO BE SEC INSPECT ALL COUNTY FACILITIES EVERY TWO YEARS. WE DO A GREAT DEAL OF WORK WITH VERY LIMITED RESOURCES WE HAVE NINE POSITIONS DEDICATED TO INSPECTIONS ONE OF THOSE POSITIONS IS CURRENTLY VACANT SO THE LAST INSPECTION CYCLE EIGHT PEOPLE WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLETING INSPECTIONS REPORTS PROVIDING EXTENSIVE ONGOING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR OVER FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY FACILITIES. AS CAITLYN NOTED THE GOVERNOR IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT CONDITIONS IN THE JAIL AND DIRECTED US TO PROVIDE MORE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY IN OUR INSPECTION PROCESS. WE BEGIN THAT PROCESS IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY. OUR TEAM GOT TO WORK RIGHT AWAY WE HAVE PLACED A AND HANDSOME. EXTENSION PROCESS- IN PLACE WITH RESOURCES WE HAVE. DOING THAT AND DURING THE PANDEMIC WE HELD VIRTUAL LISTENING SESSIONS INVITED INPUT FROM THE PUBLIC ON THIS PROCESS OUR BOARD IN THE FEBRUARY MEETING RECEIVED A DETAILED REPORT ON THOSE LISTENING SESSIONS AND I WANT TO PROVIDE JUST A FEW OF THOSE HIGHLIGHTS FOR YOU NOW. MANY OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE LISTENING SESSIONS WERE PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE WERE MANY FAMILY MEMBERS EXPRESSING CONCERNS ABOUT CONDITIONS IN. THERE WERE MANY CONCERNS EXPRESSED ABOUT COLD IT AND MANY RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD THAT WE SHOULD DO AT LEAST SOME OF OUR INSPECTIONS AND ANNOUNCE. DISCUSSIONS ON MANY OF THESE ITEMS ARE ON GOING WE ARE ABSOLUTELY OPEN TO CONDUCTING. AT SOME OF OUR INSPECTIONS ON ANNOUNCING WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE SPECIFIC STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO DO SO JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR ABOUT THAT. ATTENTION THE ATTENTION ON JAILS IN THE MEDIA AND AT OUR MEETINGS AND HERE TODAY IS IMPORTANT THE CONDITIONS IN JAILS OR OF A SERIOUS CONCERN TO ME TO THE BOARD AND TO OUR STAFF. WE ARE OPEN TO THE CONVERSATION ABOUT OUR INSPECTION PROCESS AND HOW IT CAN BE FURTHER ENHANCE THE CONVERSATION NEEDS TO INCLUDE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION. CAN WE DO MORE OF COURSE WE CAN PLEASE KEEP IN MIND WE ARE A STATE ENTITY THAT WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT. AND TO ESTABLISH REGULATIONS FOR JAIL OPERATIONS AND WE INSPECT TO THOSE STANDARDS WE'VE CARRIED OUT THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES VERY WELL HOWEVER. UNLIKE CDC ARE WITH RESPECT TO STATE PRISONS THE STATE DOES NOT RUN THE COUNTY FACILITIES THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE. THE OTHER RESPONSIBILITY OF COUNTY GOVERNMENT AND THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION. WE ARE AN INSPECTION AND COMPLIANCE ENTITY WE DO NOT HAVE INVESTIGATIVE OR ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY WE DO NOT HAVE SUBPOENA POWER WE CANNOT FILE CRIMINAL CHARGES WE CANNOT ISSUE FINES. WE CANNOT GO TO COURT FOR NON COMPLIANCE ISSUES AND SO YOU. IT IS AS IT'S NOTED IN YOUR HAND OUT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. HAS PROVIDED US WITH AN OPINION THAT WE ARE REGULATORY. AND NOT MANDATORY. HOW IN OF CARRYING A RESPONSIBLE CONSISTENT WITH THE STATUTES AND THE AUTHORITY THAT WE HAVE. THAT WE HAVE WE ARE ABSOLUTELY MEDIAN THE MAR I WOULDN'T KNOW THAT IS A FORMER PROBATION CHIEF THERE ARE TREMENDOUS INCENTIVES FOR COUNTIES TO COMPLY WITH THE STANDARDS THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES FOR FACILITIES THAT ARE NOT ABIDING BAR REGULATE. REGULATIONS THERE IS A CIVIL LIABILITY QUOTIENT THERE THERE IS LOSS OF EMPLOYMENT AND EVEN POTENTIAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY. THE IMPLICATION. THAT THE BOARD WOULD DO MORE IF IT CARED IS YOU KNOW OFFENSIVE. THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED IN THE BSE C. BECOMING SOMETHING LIKE WE ARE IF THE AND THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED IN US BECOMING SOMETHING LIKE. THE INSPECTOR GENERAL WHICH HAS OVERSIGHT. RESPONSIBILITIES FOR CDC ARE AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED RECENTLY IT IS JUST A MUCH MORE ROBUST AND STAFF INTENSIVE KIND OF OPERATION. NOW I WOULD ASK OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR DIRECTOR KATIE TO PROVIDE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT WE HAVE DONE WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE LAST YEAR UNDER OUR ENHANCED INSPECTION PROCESS. THANK YOU LINDA MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KATIE HOWARD AND-I'M HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY- I WOULD LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE BOARD'S RESPONSE TO COATED IN THE COUNTY DETENTION FACILITIES AND THEN DESCRIBE IN MORE DETAIL- THE ENHANCED INSPECTION PROCESS WHICH WE HAVE ROLLED OUT OVER THE LAST YEAR. I WILL USE THE ABBREVIATION YAQUI. AFTERTHE GOVERNOR'S DIRECTIVE LAST JANUARY WE WORKED TO QUICKLY PUT IN PLACE ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY IN TORRANCE BATCHING PROCESS THROUGH THE P. I. P. WE ARE ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF UPDATING REGULATIONS TO REFLECT. NATIONAL BEST PRACTICES THAT WORK IS IN PROGRESS RIGHT NOW. THE GOAL OF THE I. T. IS TO MORE ACTIVELY ENGAGED COUNTIES WITH OUR BOARD. AND TO PROVIDE INCREASED TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO ALL WHO ARE INTERESTED. IN OUR INSPECTIONS PROCESS. AS ONE DIMENSION WE HAVE LISTENING SESSIONS TO RECEIVE PUBLIC INPUT ON THAT YANKEE. AND THE MAJORITY OF THE COMMENTS FOCUSED ON TWO THINGS COBIT IN THE JAILS AND JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES. AND A RECOMMENDATION THAT THE SEC BE ABLE TO CONDUCT THE CRISIS OR UNANNOUNCED INSPECTIONS. THE INPUT FROM PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE AND THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHOSE LOVED ONES ARE CURRENTLY IN COUNTY JAILS WAS DIFFICULT TO HEAR. AND IT WAS HEARTFELT COMING FROM THOSE PEOPLE WHO ATTENDED OUR LISTENING SESSIONS. WE HEARD THE URGENT PLEAS FOR MORE HELP FROM THE PSEC. BUT WHAT WE HOPE FOR MAKING CLEAR TODAY IS THAT THE BSP SEES A THORNY IS LIMITED. AND WE'VE BEEN AS RESPONSIVE AS POSSIBLE THROUGH THE I. T. WE UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS ABOUT CODE IN THE JAILS. THE UNCERTAINTY THAT WE ALL HAVE FACED OVER THE LAST YEAR HAS BEEN CHALLENGING IN WAYS THAT NO ONE HAS FACED BEFORE. UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS WE OFTEN HEAR FROM STAKEHOLDERS ARE OUTSIDE OF WHAT THE FCC HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DO. AND ISSUES AROUND THE JAILS RESPONSE TO COPE WITH THE GOOD EXAMPLE. THIS IS AN AREA WHICH THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROVIDING HEALTH CARE IN COUNTY JAIL AND JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES. IS SHARED BETWEEN THE SHERIFF OR THE PROBATION CHIEF. AND A MEDICAL SERVICE PROVIDER. NONETHELESS WE- RESPONDED IN SEVERAL AND- WAYS. WE PROVIDED EXTENSIVE GUIDANCE ON OUR WEBSITE TO SHARE SOME PROBATION CHIEFS INCLUDING AT SCHOOL TO GET ON. THAT WE DEVELOPED IN COLLABORATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. WE ALSO LAUNCHED A DATA COLLECTION EFFORT TO TRACK WILL BE CASES IN MID JULY. AND THAT HAPPENED AFTER WE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE DATA COMING TO THE STATE THROUGH THE REGULAR COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH. REPORTING PROCESS WAS NOT ABLE TO QUICKLY IDENTIFY WHICH KOBE CASES WERE COMING FROM JAIL FOR JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITY. WE ALSO PREVIEW THE LOCAL FACILITY OPERATIONS SPECIFICALLY FOR KOBE NINETEEN. FOCUSING ON THE EXISTING REGULATION ABOUT THE MANAGEMENT OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES INTO CUSTODY SETTING WHICH IS REGULATION TWELVE OF SIX POINT FIVE. NOT LIKE TO TURN BACK TO THE ENHANCED INSPECT PROCESS AND TELL YOU WHAT IT INCLUDES. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT OUR INSPECTION PROCESS IS MULTI LAYERED AND IT INVOLVES SIX IT STANDS ATOP BOTH SYSTEMS OUTSIDE OF ON SITE INSPECTIONS. ARE EXPECTED SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF TIME ENSURING THE CORRECTIVE ACTION IS IN PROCESS. THE PURPOSE OF OCT BUT INSPECTIONS TO DETERMINE IF THE FACILITY IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH TITLE. SOME OF THE OPERATIONS AND TITLE TWENTY FOUR REGULATIONS ON PHYSICAL PLANT IN THE ONE PAGER THAT WE PROVIDED- UNDER THE E. I. P. WE LET YOU KNOW THAT WHEN ONE OF OUR INSPECTORS COMPLETES AN INSPECTION THEY'LL PROVIDE AN OF. AN INITIAL INSPECTION REPORT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ONSITE VERSION OF THE INSPECTION. THIS REPORT WILL OUTLINE ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING ITEMS OF NON COMPLIANCE AND IT WILL START A CLOCKWORK ISSUES MUST BE CORRECTED. OR CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN MUST BE SUBMITTED EVERY PUBLIC BOARD MEETING OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR OVER INSPECTIONS PROVIDE STATUS TO SUPPORT ON INSPECTIONS. IF THE COUNTY HAS SERIOUS ITEMS OF NON COMPLIANCE THAT REMAIN UNRESOLVED THE BOARD HAS THE OPTION TO REQUEST THAT THE SHERIFF OR PROBATION OFFICER EXCUSE ME OUR CHIEF- APPEAR BEFORE THE BOARD TO EXPLAIN THE STATUS AND WHAT THE PLAN IS TO CORRECT. THE ITEMS OF NONCOMPLIANCE. SO THIS A. I. T. INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL PUBLIC INFORMATION THAT WILL BE PROVIDED AT EVERY BOARD MEETING AND ACCOUNTABILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS AND FOURTEEN GAUGE BUT THE SHERIFF'S AND PROBATION CHIEFS IF ISSUES AREN'T ADDRESSED. WITHIN THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY THAT WE DO HAVE WE BELIEVE WE'VE DEVELOPED A RESPONSIVE AND MEANINGFUL PROGRAM FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AS LINDA MENTIONED WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE CAN MAKE. IN CLOSING I WOULD NOTE THAT THE BOARD'S STRATEGIC PLANNING OUR PROCESS IS ALSO UNDER WAY AND I HAVE A VERY STRONG SENSE THAT THESE ISSUES WILL BE PART OF THAT CONVERSATION ARE BEGINNING AS SOON AS NEXT MONTH FOR AN UPDATE TO OUR STRATEGIC. PLAN THANK YOU- DIRECT. THE MOVE A LOT OF THIS CHAIR GARCIA AND COULD MEMBER- NAME IS YOU BY A B. CALIFORNIA. FOR YOU THANK ME TEST. SEE WHAT J. THE- OF OVER THIRTY ORGANIZED. I'M THE BEAUTY BECAUSE IT'S JUST. I MYSELF AM FORMALLY. HAVE X. WRAPPING UP. AND NEGLECT IN BOTH LOCAL JUNE AND ADULT. SO I KNOW FIRST HAND WHAT. PEOPLE EXPERIENCE ON THE INSIDE. THERE'S A MASSIVE NEW. BEAT WHAT HAPPENS INSIDE FACILITIES AND THE LIMITED ACTION AT THE BCC TO THE TO TAKE WHEN CONFRONTED WITH THOSE REALITIES. REALITY TO BE A FIFTY HAS MISSED DUE TO THE WEAK REGULATIONS AND INSPECTIONS. OTHER FAILURES THE COMMUNITY HAS HAD TO PUSH HARD TO FORCE TO BE IF YOU SEE TO OPEN THEIR EYES. FOR EXAMPLE SINCE LAST APRIL COMMUNITY MEMBERS FROM RIVERSIDE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING UP AT BCC MEETINGS TO RUBIO WHAT IS HAPPENING INSIDE COUNTY JAILS. THEIR LOVED ONES ARE BEING DENIED ACCESS TO SOAP AND SPENDING TWENTY HOURS A DAY LOCKED IN THEIR CELLS. LAST FALL AND IT GETS PUSHED HEAVILY FOR THE BE A FIFTY TO HOLD A PUBLIC MEETING SESSION OF THE THIRTY INSPECTIONS AT CONDITIONS. OVER A HUNDRED PEOPLE CAME TO THIS LESSON SESSION AND SHARED HEARTBREAKING STORIES ABOUT HOW OUR LOVED ONES ARE BEING HARMED. UNDER THE BC SHE'S WATCHING FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND PARTICULARLY IN RIVERSIDE. JANUARY IN THE BUSINESS TO CONDUCT AN INSPECTION OF A RIVERSIDE JAIL. UNFORTUNATELY THE PCC CHAIRMAN STAFF SAID THEY WALKED OUT FEELING BETTER THAN WHEN THEY WENT IN. AFTER ONE SCHEDULED VISIT THAT GAVE THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT PLENTY OF TIME TO PREPARE. THE B. FIFTY BRUSH THESE ONGOING ISSUES UNDER THE RUG. WHEN I WAS INCARCERATED WE ALWAYS KNEW WHEN INSPECTORS WERE COMING ALL OF A SUDDEN CAN SURPRISE CAME OUT AND BOTH WERE OFFERED CHILDREN CANDY CANDY FOR THE CLEANEST ROOMS. SOME OF THREE MEN TAKEN INTO PRIVATE ROOMS UNTIL THE INSPECTORS LEFT SO WE COULD NOT TALK TO THEM. THIS IS A WELL KNOWN TRANSIT CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. THE BUSINESS IF SUPPOSED TO BE THE EYES AND EARS OF THE LEGISLATURE COUNTY SUPERVISORS AND THE PUBLIC. AND THEY'RE FAILING IN THIS ROLE DRASTICALLY. LEAVING THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHERS UNAWARE OF LIFE AND DEATH CONDITIONS AND UNABLE TO FIX THEM. THIS IS WHY FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS WE HAVE RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR RESTRUCTURING THE BUSINESS YOU HAVE THE FIRST STEP. AS WE NEED EQUITABLE REPRESENTATION ON THE BOARD FIRST LEADERSHIP THAT CAN CARRY. OUT A NEW VISION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRED PERCY AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS BRIAN GOLDSTINE I'M THE DIRECTOR OF POLICY INVOLVEMENT. WITH THE CENTER ON JUVENILE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE. WE SHARE THE LEN WAS SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE SEC'S FACILITY OVERSIGHT. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT RECOMMENDATIONS TO RESTRUCTURE THE AGENCY'S LEADERSHIP. BUT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT GIVING THE AGENCY DISCRETION TO DEVELOP A PLAN FOR RESPONSIBILITIES THEY'VE SHOWED NO INTEREST IN IMPLEMENTING. FOR YEARS WE MONITOR THE AGENCIES FAILURES TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS. IN JAILS AND JUVENILE FACILITIES. TO BE CLEAR THE BSE FAILURE ISN'T JUST BECAUSE THEY LACK AUTHORITY. THIS IS THEIR CHOICE THEY USE DISCRETION TO TAKE A HANDS OFF APPROACH. THEY SEE THEMSELVES AS PARTNERS OF THE VERY AGENCIES THEY INSPECT. WE HAVE TO SEE THE IMPACT ON HUMAN LIVES. YET WE JUST HEARD IF YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN'T DO. LET'S SEE HOW THEIR STAFF AND LEADERSHIP RESPONDED TO A CRISIS A CRISIS WHICH BROUGHT US HERE TODAY AND GET THE BE A FIFTY STILL FAILS TO ACKNOWLEDGE. IN JUNE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SB ASSISTING FIELD INSPECTOR SAW THE KERN COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. WITH PIC WITH PLACING PEOPLE EXPERIENCING MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IN BATHROOM SIZED ISOLATION CELLS MEANT FOR BRIEF PERIODS. STAFF HELD THEM FOR DAYS OR WEEKS. IN EXTREME ISOLATION WITHOUT MATTRESSES AND SOMETIMES TOILETS. THERE WITH A GREAT IN THE FOR BODILY FLUIDS. STAFF FORCED THEM TO SLEEP ON CONCRETE FLOORS. USING THIN YOGA MATS FOR OVER A WEEK AT A TIME. MPSC INSPECTOR SAW THIS AND ALERTED THE SHARE THAT THESE YOGA MATS VIOLATED STATE STANDARDS. THE SHERIFF'S RESPONSE BYE MORE YOGA. BE A FIFTY THEN CHOSE TO DO NOTHING. FEDERAL REPUBLIC THE LEGISLATURE EVEN AGENCIES FORT. OVER A YEAR LATER WE FINALLY LEARNED ABOUT IT BECAUSE OF A SCATHING INVESTIGATION PROPUBLICA AND THE SACRAMENTO BEE IN LATE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO READ THAT ARTICLE. NOW ANOTHER YEARS PASSED SINCE GOVERNANCE AND TOLD THE FCC TO STRENGTHEN INSPECTIONS AND THINGS HAVE GOTTEN WORSE ESPECIALLY MICROBIT WHICH IS B. S. B. C. HAS FAILED TO ADDRESS I'M HAPPY TO SPEAK ON. THE ISSUE RELATES COVERT AND BCC IF THE COMMITTEE HAS ANY QUESTIONS. BUT CLEARLY. TO BE A FIFTIES NEW INSPECTIONS REPORTING IS NOT ENOUGH. THIS ONE ARE PREVENTED WHAT HAPPENED IN KERN COUNTY. INSPO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE ILLEGALS RECOMMENDATIONS. BOUGHT IN INDEPENDENT ENTITY NOT THE NOT THE POOREST IN COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS MUST DEVELOP A PLAN FOR ACTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO ALL OF OUR PRESENTERS ON THIS ISSUE ITEM. FOR EITHER OF THE LAST TWO APELLIS THAT OVER HERE. IN YOUR OPINION WHAT ARE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU HAVE THAT BSE COULD IMPLEMENTED NOW THAT WOULD ADDRESS SOME OF YOUR CONCERNS. EITHER MISTER VIEIRA MISERABLE THING CAN ANSWER THAT. STE SURE- THANKS FOR THE QUESTION SO AGAIN WE THINK IT'S THE BE A FIFTY SHOULD IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT FOR BY YELLING GO- CLEARLY- THE AGENCY NEEDS TO HAVE- CLEAR PROGRAM A PROGRAM. CLEAR PROGRAM MISSION AND GOALS- THEY NEED TO I'M TRYING TO DO A MUCH BETTER JOB OF PUBLIC COMMUNICATION ON NON COMPLIANCE ISSUES AGAIN THE GOING BACK TO THE ISSUE OF KERN COUNTY- THE FILM SPECTER SUBURBS HAPPENING THERE. AND THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION ABOUT THAT TO THE BOOK THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION ABOUT THAT. PUBLIC- OR TO THE LEGISLATURE CLEAR. NOT BE IF YOU SEE NEEDS TO A MUCH BETTER JOB ON NON COMPLIANCE ISSUES AND THERE NEEDS TO BE FOCUSED INSPECTIONS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NO THE ISSUE OF KERN COUNTY IS ALSO CRITICAL. NOT JUST BECAUSE OF WHAT THE FEDERAL INSPECTORS SAW THE KERN COUNTY HAS ONE THE HIGHEST RATES OF SUICIDES IN INDIA ARE COUNTY JAIL IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING TO BE A FIFTY HAS EVER DISCUSSED I THINK THEY NEVER BRING IT UP AT THE BOARD MEETINGS- IT'S NOT A FOCUS AREA AND SO CLEARLY- THE BOARD IS NOT GETTING THE TYPING INFORMATION THAT IT NEEDS- TO SERVICE LEADERSHIP BODY. SO THOSE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I WOULD MAKE FOR HER- BCC. I MADE TO CHIME IN A ISRAEL AGAIN YOU WATCH THE J. I ANOTHER VERY VERY IMPORTANT RECOMMENDED FROM AL FROM L. A. O. IS A- TO BALANCE THE BOARD. WHICH AT THIS POINT IS STILL AS WE VERY LONG DA SOUL I MANY THAT THERE SHOULD BE A INCLUSION OF X. OTHER EXPERTISE IS SUCH AS MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE AND ABUSE- FACILITY CONDITIONS AND ALSO I THINK OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO BE INCLUSIVE OF FOLKS WERE ACTUALLY FORMALLY KERR STREET AND OUR SYSTEM IMPACTED- AS OFTENTIMES YOU KNOW THOSE OF US HAVE BEEN MOST IF IMPACT THERE. ARE GONNA BE CLOSER TO THE SOLUTIONS I THANK YOU. THANK YOU ENTER BSE'S. I GUESS FALLING OVER MR V. BECAUSE- DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE MAKE UP OF YOUR EXECUTIVE BOARD. CREATES A CONFLICT OF INTEREST FOR DUTIES FOR. FOR THE DEPARTMENT ARE. DOES THAT MEAN IS. IT WOULD BE BENEFIT FROM MORE DIVERSITY. THANKS FOR SERVING THEIR. ALL CHAMPION THIS IS KATE YEAH DID YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD LINDA WELL- IT'S CERTAINLY ARE THE MAKEUP OF THE BOARD. HAS BEEN RAISED BY THE LA- I THINK ALSO IMPORTANT TO THIS BODY- WHEN WE DISCUSS THIS MATTER IS THAT THAT- MAKE UP OF THAT BOARD IS SET IN STATUTE- IT IS AN ISSUE- ARE THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED. BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE- BUT IT IS NOT ONE THAT MYSELF. OR THE STAFF AT THE B. C. C. HAVE YES HE SHOULD HAVE CONTROL OVER I WILL SAY THIS WE- DO HAVE. INDIVIDUALS ON THERE THAT ARE APPOINTED BOTH BY THE SENATE. AND THE GOVERNOR APPOINTEES AND OTHERS ARE SOME OF THE MOST- ACTIVE ARE. ACTIVISTS IN THIS OF CALIFORNIA- WE HAVE. DAVID STEIN. BURKE AND- NORMA COULD BE ON WHO IS THAT I THINK JUST RECENTLY PROMOTED TO DEPUTY CHIEF OF- THE ANTI RECIDIVISM RATE AND THEN- THE MOST FAMOUS OF ALL IN ON THE PORT IS- SCOTT BUDNICK WHO IS AN EXTREMELY ACTIVE- MEMBER OF THE S. CBO COMMUNITY. HE IS NOT A CBO HIMSELF BUT HE'S CERTAINLY WORKS ARE VERY HARD- AND SPENDS A LOT OF TIME IN THAT. FACILITIES ACROSS THE STATE TALKING TO SYSTEM INVOLVED INDIVIDUALS TRYING TO GET UP CLOSE ON JUST WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT THERE. HI THIS IS KATIE IF I MAY JUST JUMP IN ON THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA HAVING TO DO WITH WHETHER THERE MIGHT BE ANY CONFLICT OF INTEREST WITH RESPECT TO THE COUNTY LEVEL- PRESENTED ITS- ARE IN THE STATUTORY MAKEUP OF THE BOARD. AS IT CURRENTLY EXISTS I KNOW THAT THE DUTIES OF THE BSE SEEKS ARM WERE VERY MUCH IN MIND AS THAT STATUTORY MAKE UP WAS DEFINED BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WHEN PUBLIC SAFETY REALIGNMENT CAST- AND SO BEAR- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MANAGE THAT ISSUE EFFECTIVELY- AND JUST TO ALSO TAKE ON WITH WHAT LINDA SAID- IN TERMS OF THERE'S BEEN UCH CONVERSATION OVER MANY YARS ABOUT- INTEREST IN THERE BEING CHANGES TO THE- APPOINTMENT STRUCTURE AND- WE WOULD BE. HAPPY TO BE INVOLVED IN ANY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK QUITE. AND THE ONLY FINAL THING I WOULD ADD IS- IT IS THAT. PARTNERSHIP OF THE OF THE- NEARLY MEMBERS ACROSS THE STATE AND THOSE ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS ON THE BOARD THAT I THINK HAVE THE BEST OUTCOMES SO I WOULD- LOOK FORWARD TO ANY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT YOU KNOW. HOW THAT MAY BE BEST A SOLITARY. AND I'M SURE GARCIA IF YOU DON'T MIND TRIANGLE LOOKING FROM- SUGGESTED IF I CAN JUST ADD TO THOSE COMMENTS. YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING HELLO I'M RYAN I'M GONNA I'M GONNA INTERRUPT BECAUSE I ASKED THE QUESTION OF SOMEBODY ELSE EARLIER AND I GAVE YOU A MOMENT SO- LET ME GO BECAUSE I'M NOT DONE WITH MY QUESTIONS FOR BSE ON THIS. SO THIS THANK YOU. SEVEN GO BACK TO BE SEC. US SO YOU MIGHT YOU REFERENCE THE APPOINTEES BY THE LEGISLATURE WHO ARE. ACTIVELY INVOLVED. MR BUT NICK I'VE SPOKEN TO IN THE PAST I KNOW STILL PRETTY CRITICAL OF THIS BOARD. I EVEN THOUGH HE'S A STRONG VOICE THERE AND- YOU LISTED THREE OUT OF THIRTEEN- AND SAY YOUR OPINION THE CITY. CREATE ENOUGH OF A BALANCE. ON THIS BOARD. ALL I DIDN'T I DID NOT MEAN TO SAY THAT IF THAT'S WHAT YOU HEARD LET ME CORRECT RIGHT AWAY AND SAY WE DO HAVE MEMBERS. THAT ARE- OUT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT ARE ON THE BOARD THE STRUCTURE AND THE MAKE UP THE BOARD AS WE SAID BEFORE IS- SET IN STATUTE AND WE COMPORT WITH THAT. SO FROM IN IN YOUR OPINION WHILE IT'S THAT INFECTION THAT FOR US BUT IN YOUR OPINION THAT THE STATUTE THAT WE SHOULD REVISIT. ABSOLUTELY THINK THAT'S WITHIN YOUR PURVIEW AND IT'S ALREADY I THINK THIS IS AN INFORMATION FINDING HEARING. NO I A THAT'S THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAY NOT THE AMONG THEIR PURVIEW IN EUROPE AND YOU SAID THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO BE AT THE TABLE IF WE DO REVISIT. THE ISSUE- IN YOUR OPINION SHOULD WE BE. ACTIVELY LOOKING TO. REVISIT THE ISSUE AND- RESTRUCTURE THINGS. IN ORDER TO HAVE A MORE FAIR AND BALANCED APPROACH THAT- IS VERY TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN ALL FAIRNESS I THINK IN THE SAME WAY THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE ADVOCATES HAVE- THE WAY TO THE TABLE I WANT TO MAKE SURE LAW ENFORCEMENT ALSO HAS A WAY TO THE TABLE BOTH THE COLDER TIME POINT IN THIS PROCESS. IS IT. WELL IN YOUR OPINION SHOULD WE REVISIT THE STATUE. I THINK THIS- WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY LOOKING AT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE L. A. L. HAVING THE DISCUSSION HAVING- THE ADVOCATE COMMUNITY AT THE TABLE RIGHT NOW GIVES YOU THE INFORMATION YOU NEED TO DO WHAT YOU THINK SHOULD BE DONE MY- PERSONAL OPINION. IS YOU KNOW THAT THE MORE. READ THE AUDIENCE SAYS THE PARTNERSHIP BENEFITS ALL INVOLVED THERE'S NOT ONE PERSON ON THAT BOARD. THAT ONCE IN HUMANE FOR TREATMENT. OF INDIVIDUALS IN CUSTODY R. AND I AND I STAND BY THAT- SITTING HERE TODAY SO WHEN WE MAKE THOSE SORTS OF ALLEGATIONS- IT'S HARMFUL TO ALL OF THE POSITIVE THE WORK WE HAVE DONE AND I WOULD SIMPLY SAY WE WELCOME ANYBODY TO THE TABLE. TO CONTINUE THE WORK. AND MADAM CHAIR. KATIE IF I COULD JUST ADD A THOUGHT- LINDA MENTIONED OF THE PUBLIC MEMBER ON OUR BOARD AND THE GOVERNOR APPOINTED NORMA COMMITTEE ON LAST YEAR WHO HAS LIVED EXPERIENCE  THAT HER PARTICIPATION- VERY ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN THE BOARD MEETING HAS BEEN A PLUS- AND THAT POSITION IS ONLY DESIGNATED AND STATUE THAT THE PUBLIC. POSITION IT WAS THE GOVERNOR'S DECISION TO CHOOSE ENORMOUS SO I CAN CERTAINLY SEE THE BENEFIT OF HER VOICE IN THE ROOM. AND I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT SHE WAS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY WITH US IN JANUARY. IN THE HEART OF THE EXTREMELY HELPFUL. I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS BUT I DO THINK NUMBER FOR HER SERVICE AND MAYBE WE NEED A LITTLE MORE NERVOUS IN THE ROOM- BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE I GIVE TIME FROM MY COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS MR STONE. THANK YOU THIS IS. SORT OF VERY CLEARLY A- MATURING OF THE REALIGNMENT SITUATION THAT I THINK WE FOUND OURSELVES AND I THINK I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THIS CAME TOGETHER THE WAY THAT IT DID GIVEN THE CONCERNED ABOUT. HOW THE STATE WAS REALIGNING THESE RESPONSIBILITIES OUT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND- THEY THE PROMISE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION THAT TIME MADE TO THOSE LOCAL AGENCIES TO NOT INTERFERE. N. F. AS I GO THROUGH THIS I GUESS I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT. BSE C. WAS REALLY SET UP MORE. AS YOU LOOK AT IT LESS ABOUT OVERSIGHT AND MORE ABOUT BEING AN ADVISORY BODY PER SE TO THE LOCAL AGENCIES AND I THINK THAT IS WHY WE DO NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT. THE ROLE OF WHAT WE EXPECT NOW B. O. C. C. TO DO AND SET STANDARDS WERE THE STATE'S RELIED A LOT OF FUNCTIONS OVER THE LAST DECADE OR MORE. INCLUDING TO THE IN THE. THE JAILS IN RELATION BETWEEN THE JAILS AND THE PRISONS BUT WE'VE DONE IT IN OTHER HUMAN SERVICES WE'VE DONE AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS AND THE ONE THING THAT I'M CONSTANTLY CONCERNEDABOUT AND WE'RE SEEING THIS I THINK IN THIS CASE IS IF THE STATE'S NOT VERY CLEAR ABOUT SETTING OUT STANDARDS AND HAVE WAYS TO ENFORCE THOSE STANDARDS IT IS TRUE THAT IT'S UP TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO IMPLEMENT AND THEY'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT IN THEIR WAY. BUT IF WE'RE NOT SENDING SOME BASELINE STANDARDS AND BEING VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE FORTIES THEN WE'RE GOING TO END UP WITH A SITUATION LIKE THIS WHERE IMPLEMENTATION IS VERY DIFFERENT COUNTY BY COUNTY. AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE CALIFORNIA WE WANT TO SEE. SO IT IS. CLEAR THAT IT'S TIME THAT WE REALLY TOOK A LOOK AT. THE MAKE UP. OPSEC END IF END. REALLY BOLSTER THEIR ABILITY TO DO THE OVERSIGHT THAT WE EXPECT. AND THAT MEANS AND THAT IS SOMETHING THE LEGISLATURE IS PRIMARILY CHARGED WITH IS OVERSIGHT OF THE ACTIVITIES HE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE JUDICIARY. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT AN ORGANIZATION LIKE BE IT C. C. HAS THE APPROPRIATE TOOLS HAS THE APPROPRIATE MEMBERSHIP HAS THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES. MISSION STATEMENTS AND ALSO ARE THE OUTLIERS WERE. REPORT HERE IS I THINK VERY INSTRUCTIVE AT PROVIDING US WITH A BIT OF A PATH FORWARD. AND COMING UP WITH STRONGER STATEMENTS AND THAT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY MATCH THAT IS THE JOB OF THE LEGISLATURE. ANTS TO ENSURE THAT THE FCC IS SET UP. TO PROVIDE THAT OVERSIGHT BUT ALSO ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE TO DO ITS OVERSIGHT. OF THOSE FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION SO I THE IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE THE SEC EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE SOME VERY SERIOUS COMPLAINTS AND SOME CONCERNS. BUT HAS BEEN TRYING TO MEASURE UP TO HOW THE DAY WERE STRUCTURED IN THE AUTHORITIES THAT THEY WERE GIVEN. BUT WHEN I LOOK AT THIS IT WAS REALLY A FAILURE OF. THE INITIAL ENABLING STATUTES TO CREATE AN APPROPRIATE STRUCTURE. AND ALLOW FOR THE OVERSIGHT INPUT AND TRANSPARENCY AND REALLY THAT'S ON US AND THAT IS ACTUALLY ONE REASON THAT IT'S INTERESTING AND BUT I THINK VERY WISE OF THE SPEAKER TO PUT THE CHAIR OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE ON THIS SUB COMMITTEE BECAUSE THIS IS AN INTERSECTION OF POLICY. AND BUDGET THAT IS REALLY ULTIMATELY VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS WE DO OVERSIGHT WHICH WE DO THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS. WE'RE ALSO. GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THIS STRUCTURES THAT WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE OR HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE OVER THE YEARS THAT LEGISLATION PUT IN PLACE. TO ACCOMPLISH VARIOUS THINGS THAT I AM JUST NOT SURE BCC IS ACCOMPLISHING WHAT WE NEED THEM TO BE ACCOMPLISHING AT THIS POINT IN TIME. AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE OVERSIGHT THE STATE PROVIDES TO THESE LOCAL AGENCIES. TO DO THE BEST JOB POSSIBLE AND- ALL OF THE TALK HERE BOTH IN THE L. A. REPORT IN FROM MEMBERS OF BCC RIGHT NOW ABOUT BEST PRACTICES. AND PROVIDING SORT OF THAT OVERSIGHT AND- N. REQUIRING LOCAL AGENCIES TO MEET MINIMUM STANDARDS WE CAN HELP SET THOSE MINIMUM STANDARDS AND THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD DO THEN I THINK WE WOULD HAVE MUCH BETTER OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE CURSED RATED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHICH WAS THE POINT WOULD BE A CC WAS THE POINT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT AS WE TRY TO CLEAN UP THE STATE LEVEL. SYSTEMS THAT IT THAT ECKHART'S THREE PEOPLE IT IS ALSO OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO REQUIRE CERTAIN MINIMUM. CAPACITY CAPABILITY AT EXPECTATIONS EVEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT I THINK OUR TASK IS HERE IT'S PRETTY CLEAR I DON'T KNOW IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME HARD WORK BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE AND THE AND THE ADVOCATES IN THIS CASE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SETTING UP THE CORRECT SYSTEM BUT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME IN THIS CONVERSATION THAT THERE'S NOT AT THIS POINT A DISAGREEMENT THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE AND THAT THERE IS A PATH AHEAD OF US OF COURSE THE DETAILS AS ALWAYS WILL NOT NECESSARILY BE THE EASIEST BUT THAT'S THAT'S THE ROLE THAT WE HAVE HERE. TO APPRECIATE MADAM CHAIR THE DISCUSSION HERE AND BRING IN THIS ITEM FORWARD. AND IT'S JUST VERY CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED OF THIS REALIGNMENT AND LOOK FOR PLACES LIKE THIS WHERE THERE ARE CLEAR NEEDS FOR STATE STANDARDS AND IMPLEMENT THOSE STANDARDS. THANK YOU. MISTER JONES SAWYER- CHAIR PENNER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR HOWARD OF WE'VE MET ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS I CAME IN. IN TWENTY TWELVE WITH SEVERAL MEMBERS ON ON THIS COMMITTEE AND I TALKED ABOUT THE INEFFICIENCIES OF PSEC- AND AT THAT TIME WE TALKED ABOUT. HOW THINGS WERE CHANGING AND THAT B. S. C. C. NEEDED TO BE PART OF THAT. IT WASN'T UNTIL THIS COMMITTEE THIS MINUTE ED IN SOME WAYS YOU MAY EVEN NEED TO APOLOGIZE TO PSEC BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE. YOU'RE STILL OPERATING. N. IN A WAY THAT YOU WERE START. AND WE'RE AT A TURNING POINT WITH RESPECT TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE- FOLKS LIKE MYSELF AND OTHERS WHO HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR AN INCREASED FOCUS ON REHABILITATION. ARE NO LONGER ALONE IN PUSHING FOR REFORM. AND MAYBE THE DATA SET UP AS YOU POINTED OUT TO US. THAT WE CREATED LEGISLATIVELY NEED TO BE CHANGED I MEAN I SIT HERE AND I SEE THE BOARD. OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS. COMMITTEE TO ME MEANS LOCAL JAILS AND SHERIFFS AND- BY YOUR OWN ADMISSION YOU SAY YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THEM YOU CAN'T TELL THEM WHAT TO DO SO WHERE IS THE COMMUNITY PART OF IT- ESPECIALLY SINCE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER THAT WE GET THINGS RIGHT WITH RESPECT TO LOCAL. DETENTION FACILITIES. IN PROP FORTY SEVEN PROP FIFTY SEVEN A REALIGNMENT OF DJJ WE WILL BE HOUSING MORE AND MORE INDIVIDUALS IN JAILS AND DETENTION FACILITY IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL SB SEC PROVIDE EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT OF THESE FACILITIES. AS WE E. A STATE CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR CILIC FACILITIES AND PROGRAMS TO REFLECT BEST PRACTICES FOR ENCOURAGING REHABILITATION AND SUCCESSFUL REINTEGRATION INTO SOCIETY. IT IS MORE- BUT- IT IS CRITICAL THAT PSEC PROVIDE EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT IF SO HE'S QUITE FRANKLY AND WE AS A STATE SHOULD PUSH TO CONTINUE PUSH FOR CIVILIANS AND PROGRAMS REFLECT BEST PRACTICES FOR ENCOURAGING REHABILITATION AND SUCCESSFUL REINTEGRATION IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT TODAY'S INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL BE TOMORROW'S NEIGHBOR WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR NEIGHBORS TO RECEIVE THE BEST EDUCATIONAL VOCATIONAL AND OTHER SUPPORT THAT. THEY NEED TO THRIVE I WOULD PARTICIPATE IN STATE COURT IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT USING OUR FUNDING SOURCES TO INCENTIVIZE REHABILITATION LAW ENFORCEMENT CANNOT CONTINUE WITH BUSINESS AS USUAL THEY MUST EMBRACE A PERSON FOCUSED REHABILITATION APPROACH RATHER THAN CONTINUING TO LOCK HIM UP AND THROW AWAY THE KEY TACTICS OF THE PAST. SO BE SEC. HAS BY THEIR OWN ADMISSION SAID THAT THEY ARE HAMSTRUNG. BY THE LEGISLATURE AND WHAT WE PUT IN PLACE. AND SO WE AS A LEGISLATURE NEED TO LOOK AT ALL VIABLE MEANS TO NOT ONLY CHANGE THE COMPOSITION OF THE B. SEC WHICH LOOKS LIKE IT SERVES TO PROTECT THE STATUS QUO. BUT WE NEED TO MAKE IT NâNG BALANCED. BUT ACTUALLY LOOK AT WHERE WE'RE MOVING AT THE STATE WHERE WHERE WHERE THE PUBLIC WANTS US TO MOVE- THAT INCLUDES EVEN LOOKING AT SHARES AND SHARES TRAINING. THAT WE PUT YOUNG CADETS IN THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IN. IN JAILS TO WHERE THEY BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO KIND OF A VIOLENT. WAY OF INTERACTING WITH THEIR CONSTITUENTS. AVACEN OFFICE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT I SHOULD BE INCENTIVIZED TO ADULT REHABILITATION FOCUSED. OR POSSIBLY LOSE THE MONEY THAT WE GIVE THEM AND WE NEED TO RETRAIN LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WE MOVE DJJ KIDS THE COUNTY DETENTION. ALL OF THIS CAN'T HAPPEN. IF WE CONTINUE TO DO THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND EXPECTING DIFFERENT RESULT AND SO I WILL WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. BOTH THE ADVOCATES. AND PEOPLE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT WE START FROM SCRATCH. WITH THIS ORGANIZATION CALLED THE B. S. C. C. AND WE HAVE A HONEST DISCUSSION WITH OURSELVES WHAT DO WE WANT THIS ORGANIZATION TO DO BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT DOING WHAT- WE WANT THEM TO DO RIGHT NOW IN TWENTY TWENTY IT MAY MADE SENSE BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY NINETEEN EIGHTY NINETEEN SEVENTY BUT- IT IS NOT WORKING. AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND SO WE REALLY DO HAVE TO HAVE THAT HONEST DISCUSSION I ALSO THINK WE NEED TO MOVE FAIRLY QUICKLY- TO DEVELOP THOSE TO DEVELOP THAT NEW STRUCTURE- IF WE DON'T WE'RE SENATE DJJ KIDS DOWN TO DATE COULD RETURN ABOUT MONIES- THERE'S HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INVOLVED IN THIS AND SO IF WE DON'T GET THIS RIGHT- WE WILL CORRECT PROBLEM IN THE LOCAL AREAS. THAT- WE WILL DIDN'T REGRET SO- MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. BUT MOST IMPORTANT- AS CHAIR PUBLIC SAFETY. I THINK WE HAVE A DAUNTING TASK ON HOW WE MOVE. THE BOTTOM ARRAY OF. DAUNTED ARE NOT I THINK WE MADE A COMMITMENT TO. I CALIFORNIANS TO WORK ON THE TASK AT HAND AND SO WITH THAT I'M GONNA PASS IT OVER TO MR LACKEY. YES THANK YOU. I JUST HAVE A QUESTION FOR ANYBODY FROM THE SEC. MY QUESTION WOULD BE WHAT THE BOARD IS NOT GIVEN EXPRESSED AT THIRTY TO ENFORCE REGULATIONS ON LOCAL DETENTION FACILITIES. ARE THERE ANY OTHER OVERSIGHT ENTITIES. OR LEGAL AVENUES FOR ENFORCEMENT. LINDA PENNER AGAIN OUT THE CHAIR OF THE BOARD AND YOU KNOW ITS- BASICALLY AS I SAID WE HAVE- SOME PEOPLE OUT OF COMPLIANCE AND THEN- WE KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN SEVERAL- REMEDIES. WHEN THAT IN FACT HAPPENS IT IN TERMS OF ANOTHER- THERE IS NO- I. G. THERE IS NO- STATEWIDE ENTITY THAT INSPECTS OTHER THAN US THERE ARE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS LOCALLY- THAT GO IN AND DO THEIR PORTION OF AN INSPECTION. AND I THINK- WHEN THOSE THINGS ARE FOUND OUT OF COMPLIANCE WE HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF- CIVIL SUITS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT IT IS A COMPLICATED EQUATION IN THAT- THERE ARE. ELECTED OFFICIALS RUNNING FACILITIES THERE ARE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THAT HAVE OVERSIGHT OF THE BUDGETS FOR THOSE FACILITIES THERE ARE APPOINTED CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS ACROSS THE STATE AND- THE OPERATION OF THESE. ENTITIES IS FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT ARE. SHAPES SIZES AND- IT IS A DAUNTING TASK TO SAY THAT WE CAN LOOK AT ALL OF THEM THINK THAT THEY ARE ON EQUAL FOOTING THE RESOURCING AND WHAT GOES ON OUT THERE MAKES IT DIFFICULT WITH THAT SAID OUR INSPECTIONS ARE CERTAINLY GOING IN AND TAKING A HARD LOOK AT WHAT WE ACTUALLY SEE INSIDE OF THE FACILITY BUT THEY ARE BACKED UP BY LOOKING AT THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES LOOKING AT- OF BACK UP INFORMATION- TO ENSURE THEIR- DOCUMENTATION SAYING THAT THEY ARE. DOING WHAT THEY'RE SAY THEY ARE DOING IN A FACILITY- CERTAINLY YOU'RE- THE LEGISLATURE WANTS US TO HAVE GREATER AUTHORITY- AS I SAID EARLIER WE ARE WILLING TO DO WHATEVER JOB WE ARE TASKED WITH DOING. OKAY- LET ME JUST SAY THIS FIRST OF ALL- THE POPULATION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. PROVIDING INSTRUCTION A CARE FOR IS A COMPLEX. COPULATION IMPRESSED TO CHARACTERIZE IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER I THINK IS PROBLEMATIC. AND FIRST OF ALL WHEN AND THE WHOLE SPIRIT OF REALIGNMENT. BEING COMMENDABLE THERE ARE SOME INHERENT PROBLEMS FROM THE GET GO THERE WERE NEVER ADMITTED TO. FIRST OF ALL GELS WERE NEVER DESIGNED FOR LONG TERM INCARCERATION. HUGE PROBLEM HUGE PROBLEM AND THERE ARE JUST SOME. SOME INHERENT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT I THINK. RBS CC'S PROBLEMS THERE ARE PROBLEMS AS LEGISLATORS AS OVERSEERS AS POLICY CREATORS WHERE THE WHERE THE ONES OF. PUT HIM IN THIS THE- UNSUCCESSFUL SITUATION KNOWN FORSMAN AUTHORITY AND OVERSIGHT. RESPONSIBILITY AS CONFLICT. I MEAN AND THEN WE TRY TO BLAME- THE OVERSIGHT. GROUP OF PEOPLE FOR THE PROBLEM. I THINK THAT- THIS IS CLEARLY SOMETHING WE NEED TO. THE EVALUATE AND I THINK. WE JUST HAVE TO BE CAREFUL I THINK BALLOTS ALWAYS NEEDS TO BE THE GOAL. AND I WILL I HOPE THAT- BALANCE IS NOT ONLY A CONCERN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR ASPECT IN PUBLIC POLICY THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A PROBLEM ELSEWHERE BUT THIS IS CLEARLY A POPULATION THAT WE ALL BENEFIT FROM IF WITH THAT ARRIVE IN OUR GOAL OF REHABILITATION HOWEVER. WE ALSO HAVE TO BE- IN A SITUATION THAT THOSE WHO ARE CARRIED OUT WITH THE OVERSTEPPING ARE ALSO PROTECTED AND SO THAT THOSE ARE THE BALANCES THAT NEED TO BE CONSIDERED AND I LOOK FORWARD TO BE A PART OF THE TEAM TO ADDRESS THESE. CHALLENGES IN A MEANINGFUL WAY BUT THERE'S SOME POLICY ADJUSTMENTS THAT NEED TO BE MADE IMMEDIATELY. AND I AND I LOOK FOR TO BE A PART OF THAT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS ON THE OVERSIGHT ISSUE MR LIKE AND SO I DO HAVE A OF FOLLOWING UP WITH THAT THEN- A QUESTION FOR THE SEC. IF YOU WERE PROVIDED WITH THE OVERSIGHT OR ENFORCEMENT METHODS. ARE THERE. ARE THERE SPECIFIC METHODS THAT YOU THINK- WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE. I'D LIKE TO START ON THAT THIS IS KATIE HOWARD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR- HANTS INSPECTION PROCESS AND I AM HOPEFUL THAT WITHIN THE EXISTING RESOURCES AS WENEED MORE REGULARLY REPORT TO THE BOARD I WILL CONCEDE THERE HAD NOT PRIOR TO THE ENHANCED INSPECTION PROCESS BEEN. REGULAR UPDATES GIVEN TO OUR PORTS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR WE GENERALLY MEET SIX TIMES A YEAR ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN- IDENTIFIED IN OUR INSPECTIONS SO I THINK THAT'S GOING TO PROVIDE A WHOLE LOT MORE INFORMATION TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY WE'RE ALSO POSTING THOSE INITIAL INSPECTION REPORTS ONLINE. AS SOON AS THEY ARE COMPLETED- SO AGAIN THAT'S MORE OF THE WITHIN EXISTING RESOURCES YES WE CAN DO MORE TO HAVE MORE TRANSPARENCY AND INFORMATION AVAILABLE- WITH MORE RESOURCES WE CERTAINLY COULD DO MORE. ARE THERE. THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THANK YOU FOR THE ADDITIONAL- HAS FRIENDS IN A IN A MEETING WITH US AND HAS INSPECTION PROCESS ARE THERE SPECIFIC METHODS OF ENFORCEMENT IN YOUR EXPERIENCE THAT YOU THINK WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE IF WE ARE BEGINNING A DISCUSSION OF HOW WE DO THIS BETTER. ON HOW WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR GOALS AND HOW WE LEARN FROM FROM THE MOMENT WHEN ARE THERE SPECIFIC- ENFORCEMENT MEANT THAT THAT YOU THINK. WOULD BE EFFECTIVE IN ENSURING COMPLIANCE. AS WEAK AS WE CONSIDER THE WORK AHEAD OF REFORM. I I WANT TO GET THE MOST DIRECT ANSWER THAT I CAN BUT UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THIS OPENS UP REALLY HUGE POLICY TANGLE IF YOU WELL WHEN IT COMES TO THE STATE OF THE LIMITS ON THE STATE'S AUTHORITY TO DIRECT. HOW THE COUNTIES DO THINGS SO- I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT IS A BIG CHALLENGE IN THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION AREA- AND YOU KNOW I THINK. AGAIN THOSE ARE THE THOSE ISSUES COME UP FAST ACROSS SO MANY DIFFERENT POLICY ISSUE AREAS THE STATE AND LOCAL- DIFFERENCES AND- THAT'S WHY I WAS SO INTERESTED TO HEAR THE RECENT DISCUSSIONS. OUT OF THE- ALLY G. IN THE VARIOUS BUDGET HEARINGS BECAUSE THAT'S AN ENTITY THAT DOES HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT WITHIN THE STATE STRUCTURE THIS IS DIFFERENT WHERE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH OUR- COMPLIANCE RESPONSIBILITIES. WITH RESPECT TO FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTY GOVERNMENTS WHO ARE THE ACTUAL ENTITIES RUNNING THESE FACILITIES. JUST WAIT A MINUTE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OPENET- I THINK THE MEMBERS HAVE HAD GREAT COMMENTS AND NOTING THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS ISSUE AND- I HAVE TO. REITERATE WHAT- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR HOWARD JUST MENTIONED ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH. YES YOU SEE IN THEIR OVERSIGHT ROLE IS BACK IN BEING PRESCRIPTIVE FROM A STATE AGENCY TO THE COUNTIES AS FAR AS MANDATE IT MUST AND MUST NOT DO. IT OPENS UP POTENTIAL ISSUES WITH STATE REIMBURSABLE MANDATES ARE PROP THIRTY TRIGGERS AND I THINK. THAT'S ONE OF THE DIFFICULT ISSUES. OR DOES IT YOU CAN NAVIGATE HOW. DIRECT COUNTY AND PROVIDE THEM WITH. AND TECHNICAL. WITHOUT ISSUING ANY KIND OF. IRAQ MANDATE THAT WOULD BE REIMBURSABLE BY THE STATE SAVINGS I THINK IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED ISSUE BUT THE RESTORATION IS HAPPY TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION IN SUPPORT OF MOTOR ROBUST OVERSIGHT OF THAT COUNTY JAILS. SO IT'S THE I THINK IT'S COMPLICATED SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING IN THIS DISCUSSION TO DO THE PROCESS BETTER- AND WE CAN LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE STATE GIVING MORE MONIES ARE GIVING MONEY TO THE COUNTY IN THIS PROCESS BUT IT NEEDS TO COME WITH THE KHAN ABILITY IN TRANSPARENCY IN ENSURING THERE WERE GETTING THEIR MONEY'S WORTH AND SO BOTH OF THE POLICY PROCESS PART PROCESSING COMMITTEES THANK- MISTER JONES SAWYER IS A PUBLIC SAFETY OR THROUGH THIS BUDGET PROCESS THIS DISCUSSION MUST CONTINUE. SO WE CAN'T ACTUALLY MEET OUR GOAL FOR MOVING FORWARD AND HONOR OUR COMMITMENTS. AT THAT TOO WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT ENGAGEMENT. I ARE THERE ANY MORE QUESTIONS ON THIS TOPIC LET ME MINDFUL OF TIME IS. A THAT IS. THE REAL QUICK TO THE ONLY- HAVE ANY. EXAMPLES OF OTHER OVERSIGHT AND TO SEE ENTITIES THEY WOULD ENVISION THAT THE B. B. SEC SHOULD LOOK LIKE OR OPERATE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE L. L. AND THERE ISN'T ONE- THIS. INDIVIDUAL ENTITY THAT WE IDENTIFIED THAT- FILLED ALL THAT. PURSUES THE SAME GOALS THAT WE RECOMMENDED AND- HAS A PROGRAM IN LINE A LINE WITH THOSE GOALS IN THE WAY THE SPECIFIC WAYS THAT BE RECOMMENDED- BUT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF. ENTITIES OUT THERE THAT HAVE BITS AND PIECES OF WHAT WE- HAVE RECOMMENDED FOR THE DIRECTION THAT THE STATE GO WITH RESPECT TO THE SEC STANDARDS AND INSPECTION PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE- TEXAS USES A- A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PIECES OF. DATA ON AND- JAIL OUTCOMES AND PROC BOTH SO FOR EXAMPLE DEATHS OR- AT YOURSELF- CERTAIN RESPONSES- ORDER CRITICAL EVENTS GOING ON IN THE JAILS WORK- IN REPORTING STANDARDS VIOLATIONS THEY THEY GATHER A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SOURCES OF INFORMATION- AND USE THAT TO INFORM THEIR INSPECTION STRATEGY. TO HOPEFULLY I AM IDENTIFYING TARGET THE FACILITIES THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAPPEN MOST SERIOUS ISSUES AND THE GOVERNOR HAS- DIRECTED THE SEC TO TAKE A STEP IN THIS DIRECTION BUT WE AS WE OUTLINED IN THE- REPORT. WE THINK THAT THAT THAT AGENCY CAN GO FURTHER- AND TEXAS IS ONE MODEL- AND THEN AS FAR AS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WE HAD A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS ON THAT AND TENNESSEE ACTUALLY IS- EXAMPLE WE POINT TO A REPORT BECAUSE. THEY HAVE A- I CONSULTANT THAT WORKS. AND THAT IS IN. FROM THE STATE STANDARDS AGENCY BY- WORKS CLOSELY WITH THAT AGENCY TO. PROVIDE AND NOT FROM AN ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE- THE FOR MEN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PERSPECTIVE- LONGER TERM SUPPORT TO FACILITIES THAT ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE THAT ARE DEALING WITH THE- ISSUES THAT MR LACKEY POINTED OUT FOR EXAMPLE. WHERE IT'S NOT NECESSARILY SOMETHING THAT THE FACILITY ITSELF CAN CHANGE- DIRECTLY AND CERTAINLY NOT WITHIN A SIXTY DAY COMPLIANCE BECAUSE IT MAY INVOLVE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS SUCH AS- THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND MAKING A REALLY COMPLEX SYSTEMIC ISSUE- AND SO THAT. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CONSULTANTS IS AVAILABLE TO HELP AND DOES IT. SELL AND COMMUNITIES COME TOGETHER AND ADDRESS THE ISSUE. THAT'S SOMETHING WE RECOMMEND THIS YOU COULD SEE CONSIDER- AND THEN FINALLY ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT WE POINT TO IN THE REPORT IS THAT IT. OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL WHICH OVERSEES STATE PRISONS IN CALIFORNIA AND I WAS NOTED IT IS- IT FILLS IN A LARGE DEGREE A DIFFERENT TYPE OF OVERSIGHT THERE'S VERY VERY IS DIFFERENT OVERSIGHT- FUNCTIONS THAT ARE DISCUSSED IN THE LITERATURE ON CORRECTIONAL OVERSIGHT AND HAPPY TO. GET MORE IN TUNE IF- IF THAT BE HELPFUL BUT AT A HIGH LEVEL- REGULATION IS JUST ONE TYPE OF OVERSIGHT FUNCTION- THAT THAT IS PROBABLY THE CLOSEST THING TO WHAT THE FCC DOES BUT THEN THERE'S MONITORING- WHICH IS MORE KIND OF LOOKING AT HOLISTICALLY HOW ARE THE PEOPLEIN THIS FACILITY- BEING TREATED- AND IT'S MORE IN. A KIND OF. LONGER TERM LOOKING AT X. AND THERE'S INVESTING. WITH TO THE A SPECIFIC IN THAT HAPPENED. WHAT WENT WRONG HERE- THOSE ARE ALL DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS AND- I. G. DOES SOME OF THOSE FUNCTIONS- SO THAT'S WHAT PART OF THE REASON THEY HAVE A BIGGER- BUDGET BUT AND- IT'S MARIN STAFFING INTENSIVE AS WAS NOTED- BUT WHAT THINK ONE THING WE POINT TO IN THE REPORT THAT. WE GOT THAT THEY DO PARTICULARLY WELL IS THERE REPORTING STYLE- IT'S REALLY IT'S A LOT WELL ALIGNED WITH. THE SEVERITY OF THE VIOLATION IT'S KINDA WELL ALIGNED WITH- HOW SORT OF THE INTENSITY OF THE REPORT THAT THEY PRODUCE AND THE SPEED WITH WHICH THEY PUT OUT A REPORT- TO SET TO SOME DEGREE SIR KIND OF. THEIR KIND OF RAISED ALARM IN A IN A WAY THAT FEELS A MORE APPROPRIATE RELATIVE TO. THE ISSUE AT HAND- IT'S ALSO A VERY ACCESSIBLE- LANGUAGE FOR THE LAY AUDIENCE AND THEIR WEBSITE HAS- MAKES IT. IS VERY INTERACTIVE AND EASY TO LOOK AT. TRENDS IF YOU LISTEN AND THEY ALSO SORT OF. TRY TO SURFACE SYSTEMIC ISSUE BASED ON THAT- THEY'RE NOT JUST SPEAKING TO THE FACILITY ADMINISTRATORS BUT- RAISING ISSUES THAT MAY REQUIRE THE LEGISLATURE TO ACT ON AND GIVEN THAT THEY HAVE EYES ON THE FACILITY BOOTS ON THE GROUND. I THINK THE SEC IS IN A POSITION TO DO- SOME OF THAT TYPE OF WORK THAT DATE THEY ARE IN A GOOD POSITION TO IDENTIFIED SYSTEMIC. ISSUES WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT THEY SHOULD REPLICATE THESE PACKAGING. BUT UT WE THINK THERE'S SOME USEFUL LESSONS. TO BE DRAWN. AND THE PS. DO YOU THAT YOUR- IS A PER. SO TO MEET THE SUGGESTIONS BOTH THE COMMITTEE ON. THAT THE L. A. O. PROPOSED. WE ARE NOT MADAM. WE ARE IF THERE'S AN EXPANSION OF DUTIES I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THE NUMBERS WE PROVIDED YOU EARLIER WITH- C.

FOR YEARS PSEC HAS DEVELOPED SUBPAR FACILITY REGULATIONS IN PROCESS IS DOMINATED BY THOSE THAT RUN THESE FACILITIES. AND FAILED TO HOLD COUNTIES ACCOUNTABLE. BBC CLAIMS COULD NOT HAVE DONE MORE WITH IT. YET WE ARE HERE IN LARGE PART BECAUSE THE NEWS ARTICLE BY PROPUBLICA IN FACT HE HAS SUCCESSFULLY PRESSED THE STATE TO ADDRESS THE FTC SHORTCOMINGS. IN ITSELF SHOWS THE POWER OF STEPPING UP AND COMMUNICATING WHAT HARM IS BEING DONE TO HUMANS. PSEC HAS KEPT IN THE DARK AS HARMFUL CONDITIONS HAVE UNFOLDED UNDER THEIR WATCH. THE AGENCY LACKED POLITICAL WILL AND VISION FOR THE FUTURE.
