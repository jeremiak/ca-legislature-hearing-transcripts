NUMBERS BUT I HAVE SOME

00:34:47.185 --> 00:34:50.188 region:rollup2
UNOFFICIAL. TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:34:48.687 --> 00:34:52.090 region:rollup2
NUMBERS.

00:34:50.188 --> 00:34:53.959 region:rollup2

ENTANGLEMENTS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN.

00:34:53.959 --> 00:34:57.562 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES ARE THAT THE ACTUAL

00:34:56.227 --> 00:34:59.331 region:rollup2
NUMBER IS ABOUT TEN TIMES THE

00:34:57.562 --> 00:34:59.898 region:rollup2
AMOUNT.

00:34:59.331 --> 00:35:01.366 region:rollup2
I JUST BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU

00:34:59.898 --> 00:35:02.801 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:35:01.366 --> 00:35:03.668 region:rollup2
JUST PEOPLE OUT ON THE WATER

00:35:02.801 --> 00:35:05.804 region:rollup2
JUST HAPPENED TO SEE THESE

00:35:03.668 --> 00:35:07.505 region:rollup2
WHALES SO THEY ACTUALLY BELIEVE

00:35:05.804 --> 00:35:08.340 region:rollup2
THE NUMBERS TEN TIMES THAT. THE

00:35:07.505 --> 00:35:10.375 region:rollup2
NORTH PACIFIC HUMPBACK

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:11.843 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS ARE STABLE HOWEVER

00:35:10.375 --> 00:35:13.211 region:rollup2
THE CENTRAL AMERICAN POPULATION

00:35:11.843 --> 00:35:15.213 region:rollup2
WITH ONLY FOUR HUNDRED ELEVEN

00:35:13.211 --> 00:35:16.548 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS IS IN JEOPARDY AND

00:35:15.213 --> 00:35:18.350 region:rollup2
FEEDS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY OFF

00:35:16.548 --> 00:35:19.217 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND OREGON.

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:21.386 region:rollup2
AND ALSO.

00:35:19.217 --> 00:35:23.755 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWO OF THE TWENTY NINE

00:35:21.386 --> 00:35:25.357 region:rollup2
VERIFIED CASES INVOLVED THE

00:35:23.755 --> 00:35:26.224 region:rollup2
DUNGEON* CRAB FISHERY.

00:35:25.357 --> 00:35:28.293 region:rollup2
SO THAT HAS BECOME.

00:35:26.224 --> 00:35:36.368 region:rollup2
.

00:35:28.293 --> 00:35:40.138 region:rollup2
A AN ISSUE.

00:35:36.368 --> 00:35:46.511 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:35:40.138 --> 00:35:49.581 region:rollup2
BERTHA.

00:35:46.511 --> 00:35:51.583 region:rollup2
SO ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES IS.

00:35:49.581 --> 00:35:53.351 region:rollup2
THE CONCENTRATION OF TRAPS

00:35:51.583 --> 00:35:55.153 region:rollup2
WITH STAGGERED SEASON OPENINGS

00:35:53.351 --> 00:35:57.288 region:rollup2
VESSELS FROM AFAR AS FAR AWAY AS

00:35:55.153 --> 00:35:59.057 region:rollup2
ALASKA CAN COME TO CALIFORNIA

00:35:57.288 --> 00:35:59.591 region:rollup2
AND FISH OUT THE DISTRICTS HERE

00:35:59.057 --> 00:36:00.558 region:rollup2
BEFORE RETURNING TO THEIR

00:35:59.591 --> 00:36:02.327 region:rollup2
DISTRICT.

00:36:00.558 --> 00:36:04.562 region:rollup2
FOR THE OPENING SO THIS IS ALSO

00:36:02.327 --> 00:36:06.231 region:rollup2
LED TO A DRAMATIC DECLINE IN

00:36:04.562 --> 00:36:08.266 region:rollup2
INCOME FOR LOCAL FISHERMEN. AS

00:36:06.231 --> 00:36:09.100 region:rollup2
LOCAL SPOTS GET PLUNDERED BY THE

00:36:08.266 --> 00:36:16.441 region:rollup2
US LARGER VESSELS

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:18.343 region:rollup2
FROM OTHER DISTRICTS.

00:36:16.441 --> 00:36:19.611 region:rollup2
SO WHEN VERY ALARMING SITUATION

00:36:18.343 --> 00:36:21.579 region:rollup2
IS THE ENTANGLEMENT OF BLUE

00:36:19.611 --> 00:36:23.515 region:rollup2
WHALES THE LARGEST ANIMAL IN THE

00:36:21.579 --> 00:36:25.316 region:rollup2
WORLD WHICH FIRST OCCURRED.

00:36:23.515 --> 00:36:27.352 region:rollup2
REPORTED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WITH

00:36:25.316 --> 00:36:30.055 region:rollup2
ONE BLUE WHALE THEN INCREASE TO

00:36:27.352 --> 00:36:31.122 region:rollup2
FOREIGN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND.

00:36:30.055 --> 00:36:32.457 region:rollup2
ARE THERE ARE THREE AND TWENTY

00:36:31.122 --> 00:36:34.259 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN.

00:36:32.457 --> 00:36:35.794 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S ONLY TWENTY TEN TO

00:36:34.259 --> 00:36:37.962 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO WHEELS

00:36:35.794 --> 00:36:39.998 region:rollup2
WORLDWIDE AND JUST OVER. TWO

00:36:37.962 --> 00:36:42.267 region:rollup2
THOUSAND ALONG THE PACIFIC COAST

POPULATION.

00:36:48.139 --> 00:36:51.709 region:rollup2
HERE WE HAVE A GRAPH WHERE YOU

00:36:50.709 --> 00:36:52.911 region:rollup2
CAN SEE THE ESCALATION IN

00:36:51.709 --> 00:36:54.245 region:rollup2
TELEMANN'S OVER THE PAST SIXTEEN

00:36:52.911 --> 00:36:56.781 region:rollup2
YEARS.

00:36:54.245 --> 00:36:57.982 region:rollup2
ON PRETTY MUCH BEFORE TWENTY

00:36:56.781 --> 00:36:59.484 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN WAS KIND OF HOVERING

00:36:57.982 --> 00:37:01.086 region:rollup2
OVER YOU KNOW AROUND BETWEEN TEN

00:36:59.484 --> 00:37:02.921 region:rollup2
AND TWENTY. WITH SORT OF A

00:37:01.086 --> 00:37:04.522 region:rollup2
DRAMATIC ESCALATION AFTER TWENTY

00:37:02.921 --> 00:37:06.257 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN.

00:37:04.522 --> 00:37:07.992 region:rollup2
AND WITH TWENTY SIXTEEN.

00:37:06.257 --> 00:37:09.227 region:rollup2
PICKING AT SEVENTY ONE REPORTED

00:37:07.992 --> 00:37:09.394 region:rollup2
ENTANGLEMENTS.

00:37:09.227 --> 00:37:10.962 region:rollup2
SO.

00:37:09.394 --> 00:37:11.796 region:rollup2
.

00:37:10.962 --> 00:37:18.870 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE HOW IT'S ESCALATED

00:37:11.796 --> 00:37:20.004 region:rollup2
HERE.

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:21.406 region:rollup2
THE UNOFFICIAL NUMBER FROM NOVA

00:37:20.004 --> 00:37:23.007 region:rollup2
FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN IS FORTY

00:37:21.406 --> 00:37:23.742 region:rollup2
ONE REPORTED ENTANGLEMENTS SO

00:37:23.007 --> 00:37:24.809 region:rollup2
THEIR HOUSE BEEN A SLIGHT

00:37:23.742 --> 00:37:26.144 region:rollup2
PULLBACK ALTHOUGH WHEN YOU

00:37:24.809 --> 00:37:27.412 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THE RECORDED NUMBERS

00:37:26.144 --> 00:37:28.713 region:rollup2
ARE REFLECTIVE OF ROUGHLY ONE

00:37:27.412 --> 00:37:30.148 region:rollup2
TENTH OF THE NUMBER OF THE

00:37:28.713 --> 00:37:35.420 region:rollup2
ACTUAL ENTANGLEMENTS.

00:37:30.148 --> 00:37:36.254 region:rollup2
THE NUMBERS ARE STILL ARMING.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:37.655 region:rollup2
HERE ARE ENTANGLEMENT REPORTS BY

00:37:36.254 --> 00:37:39.491 region:rollup2
COUNTY

00:37:37.655 --> 00:37:41.226 region:rollup2
SO FROM TWO THOUSAND TO TWO

00:37:39.491 --> 00:37:42.527 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FIFTEEN.

00:37:41.226 --> 00:37:42.727 region:rollup2
ON YOU CAN SEE THE NUMBERS UP

00:37:42.527 --> 00:37:44.262 region:rollup2
HERE.

00:37:42.727 --> 00:37:46.397 region:rollup2
.

00:37:44.262 --> 00:37:47.298 region:rollup2
AND IN TWENTY SIXTEEN FORTY TWO

00:37:46.397 --> 00:37:48.066 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF REPORTED

00:37:47.298 --> 00:37:49.901 region:rollup2
ENTANGLEMENTS WERE IN MONTEREY

00:37:48.066 --> 00:37:52.670 region:rollup2
COUNTY.

00:37:49.901 --> 00:37:54.239 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE SEEING. EXTREMELY HIGH

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:56.141 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE OF ENTANGLEMENTS IS

00:37:54.239 --> 00:37:57.008 region:rollup2
OCCURRING IN THAT ONE AREA.

00:37:56.141 --> 00:37:57.842 region:rollup2
WHICH IS ALSO THE NATIONAL

00:37:57.008 --> 00:38:01.179 region:rollup2
MARINE.

00:37:57.842 --> 00:38:02.647 region:rollup2
SANCTUARY.

00:38:01.179 --> 00:38:04.015 region:rollup2
I SPOKE TO FISHERMEN IN BODEGA

00:38:02.647 --> 00:38:05.216 region:rollup2
BAY WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN AN

00:38:04.015 --> 00:38:07.252 region:rollup2
ENTANGLEMENT AND THERE THIRTY

00:38:05.216 --> 00:38:08.820 region:rollup2
YEARS ON THE WATER.

00:38:07.252 --> 00:38:10.555 region:rollup2
I ASKED THEM TO SPECULATE YOU

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:12.690 region:rollup2
KNOW ABOUT WHY THEY THOUGHT THAT

00:38:10.555 --> 00:38:13.992 region:rollup2
WAS THE CASE AND HE SAID THAT

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:15.860 region:rollup2
THE CURRENTS WERE EXTREMELY

00:38:13.992 --> 00:38:17.228 region:rollup2
STRONG IN BODEGA BAY. THAT MAY

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:18.863 region:rollup2
BE ONE REASON THAT YOU THE LINES

00:38:17.228 --> 00:38:20.765 region:rollup2
ARE TALKS.

00:38:18.863 --> 00:38:21.833 region:rollup2
AND LESS ENTANGLEMENTS OCCUR NOW

00:38:20.765 --> 00:38:23.902 region:rollup2
THIS IS SPECULATION BUT.

00:38:21.833 --> 00:38:25.370 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST ALARMING THAT SO MANY

00:38:23.902 --> 00:38:26.905 region:rollup2
OF THERE'D BEEN TENANTS DO A

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:28.640 region:rollup2
CURRENT AND MONTEREY.

00:38:26.905 --> 00:38:29.874 region:rollup2
SO MONTEREY IS ALSO.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.942 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE SOUTHERN MOST

00:38:29.874 --> 00:38:33.978 region:rollup2
LOCATIONS WERE CRAP FISHING

00:38:30.942 --> 00:38:35.280 region:rollup2
TAKES PLACE.

00:38:33.978 --> 00:38:37.482 region:rollup2
AND ACTUALLY ACCOUNTS FOR

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:39.384 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY.

00:38:37.482 --> 00:38:40.051 region:rollup2
A SMALLER CROWD HARVEST COMPARED

00:38:39.384 --> 00:38:44.055 region:rollup2
TO OTHER.

00:38:40.051 --> 00:38:45.390 region:rollup2
OTHER DISTRICTS.

00:38:44.055 --> 00:38:48.293 region:rollup2
HERE'S A MAP OF MONTEREY BAY

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:49.761 region:rollup2
NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARY.

00:38:48.293 --> 00:38:51.763 region:rollup2
SO COMMERCIAL FISHING IS ALLOWED

00:38:49.761 --> 00:38:54.332 region:rollup2
IN THE SANCTUARY HOWEVER IT IS

00:38:51.763 --> 00:38:56.367 region:rollup2
ALSO SUPPOSED TO PROTECT WHALES

00:38:54.332 --> 00:38:58.069 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL DESIGNATION.

00:38:56.367 --> 00:38:59.938 region:rollup2
THERE IS ALSO A STATE MARINE

00:38:58.069 --> 00:39:01.906 region:rollup2
RESERVE FOR COME CRUCIAL FISHING

00:38:59.938 --> 00:39:03.675 region:rollup2
IS PROHIBITED AND THEN THE STATE

00:39:01.906 --> 00:39:05.076 region:rollup2
MARINE CONSERVATION AREA WERE

00:39:03.675 --> 00:39:07.579 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL FISHING IS ALSO

00:39:05.076 --> 00:39:09.747 region:rollup2
ALLOWED.

00:39:07.579 --> 00:39:11.049 region:rollup2
UP THE STATE MPAS ARE CLOSER TO

00:39:09.747 --> 00:39:12.450 region:rollup2
SHORE AND LESS LIKELY TO HAVE

00:39:11.049 --> 00:39:13.952 region:rollup2
ENTANGLEMENTS OCCUR THERE BUT

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:15.653 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL MARINE SANCTUARY IS

00:39:13.952 --> 00:39:16.955 region:rollup2
A DEEP CANYON WORDS BELIEVE THAT

00:39:15.653 --> 00:39:22.927 region:rollup2
MOST OF THE ENTANGLEMENTS ARE

00:39:16.955 --> 00:39:24.929 region:rollup2
OCCURRING.

00:39:22.927 --> 00:39:26.931 region:rollup2
.

00:39:24.929 --> 00:39:28.466 region:rollup2
SO ROUGHLY TEN PERCENT OF EACH

00:39:26.931 --> 00:39:30.902 region:rollup2
FISHERMAN'S GEARS LOST EVERY

00:39:28.466 --> 00:39:32.770 region:rollup2
YEAR WHICH IS A VERY.

00:39:30.902 --> 00:39:34.439 region:rollup2
THE HIGHER UP AMOUNT.

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:35.540 region:rollup2
HERE'S A PIE CHART SHOWING

00:39:34.439 --> 00:39:38.109 region:rollup2
CAUSES OF LOBSTER BAND GEAR WITH

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:40.845 region:rollup2
THE SECOND LARGEST PERCENTAGE.

00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:42.513 region:rollup2
AS UNKNOWN.

00:39:40.845 --> 00:39:43.715 region:rollup2
I AS AN UNKNOWN BECAUSE.

00:39:42.513 --> 00:39:45.250 region:rollup2
SO EIGHT THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED

00:39:43.715 --> 00:39:47.118 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWO TOTAL TRAPS WERE

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:48.953 region:rollup2
REPORTED LOST IN TWO YEARS

00:39:47.118 --> 00:39:50.655 region:rollup2
ACROSS CALIFORNIA FROM TWENTY

00:39:48.953 --> 00:39:52.223 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN. SO

00:39:50.655 --> 00:39:53.057 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT INCLUDE LOS TRAPS

00:39:52.223 --> 00:39:55.059 region:rollup2
THAT WERE NOT REPORTED.

00:39:53.057 --> 00:39:57.762 region:rollup2
.

00:39:55.059 --> 00:39:59.197 region:rollup2
SO YOU HAVE THE VARIOUS.

00:39:57.762 --> 00:40:00.865 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT ARE CAUSING THIS

00:39:59.197 --> 00:40:03.735 region:rollup2
WHETHER BEING THE LARGEST ONE

00:40:00.865 --> 00:40:04.269 region:rollup2
AND SORRY UNKNOWN CAUSES.

00:40:03.735 --> 00:40:10.041 region:rollup2
WELL AND THEN FOLLOWED BY

00:40:04.269 --> 00:40:10.975 region:rollup2
WHETHER.

00:40:10.041 --> 00:40:12.543 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY DISENTANGLE MEN'S ARE

00:40:10.975 --> 00:40:14.112 region:rollup2
HANDLED BY VOLUNTEERS WITH

00:40:12.543 --> 00:40:15.246 region:rollup2
LITTLE FUNDS AND RESOURCES THE

00:40:14.112 --> 00:40:16.481 region:rollup2
VOLUNTEERS ARE RISKING THEIR

00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:17.715 region:rollup2
LIVES TO GET UP NEXT TO THE

00:40:16.481 --> 00:40:19.083 region:rollup2
WHALE THE CUT THE ROPE OFF WITH

00:40:17.715 --> 00:40:20.385 region:rollup2
A KNIFE.

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:21.653 region:rollup2
AND LESS THAN TEN PERCENT OF

00:40:20.385 --> 00:40:26.624 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTED DISENTANGLE MEN'S OUR

00:40:21.653 --> 00:40:27.592 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL.

00:40:26.624 --> 00:40:29.661 region:rollup2
THE CALENDAR CALIFORNIA

00:40:27.592 --> 00:40:31.262 region:rollup2
DUNGENESS CRAB.

00:40:29.661 --> 00:40:32.697 region:rollup2
FISHING WORKING GROUP PROVIDES

00:40:31.262 --> 00:40:33.998 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO

00:40:32.697 --> 00:40:35.667 region:rollup2
THE CRAB FISHING INDUSTRY THEY

00:40:33.998 --> 00:40:37.302 region:rollup2
HAVE CREATED A BEST PRACTICES

00:40:35.667 --> 00:40:38.937 region:rollup2
GUIDE AND THE RISK ASSESSMENT

00:40:37.302 --> 00:40:40.371 region:rollup2
MITIGATION PROGRAM.

00:40:38.937 --> 00:40:42.807 region:rollup2
HOWEVER PARTICIPATION

00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:45.376 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF GUIDELINES BY

00:40:42.807 --> 00:40:46.778 region:rollup2
FISHERMEN ARE TOTALLY VOLUNTARY.

00:40:45.376 --> 00:40:48.780 region:rollup2
THEY CAN CHOOSE NOT TO COMPLY

00:40:46.778 --> 00:40:50.515 region:rollup2
WITH GUIDELINES IF THEY DECIDE.

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:51.015 region:rollup2
AND ALSO THE PUBLIC IS NOT

00:40:50.515 --> 00:40:56.721 region:rollup2
ALLOWED TO ATTEND THESE

00:40:51.015 --> 00:40:58.089 region:rollup2
MEETINGS.

00:40:56.721 --> 00:41:00.091 region:rollup2
SO POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS.

00:40:58.089 --> 00:41:01.292 region:rollup2
ELECTRONIC TRACKING IS

00:41:00.091 --> 00:41:03.695 region:rollup2
APPEALING SOLUTION BECAUSE IT

00:41:01.292 --> 00:41:05.730 region:rollup2
WOULD BOTH HELP.

00:41:03.695 --> 00:41:07.165 region:rollup2
BOTH WALES AND FISHERMEN PLACING

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:09.067 region:rollup2
TRACKING DEVICES ON BOOZE WOULD

00:41:07.165 --> 00:41:10.268 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY TRACK LAST YEAR BUT A

00:41:09.067 --> 00:41:11.769 region:rollup2
CONTRACT A WHALE THAT'S

00:41:10.268 --> 00:41:12.770 region:rollup2
ENTANGLED IN THE GEAR. AND

00:41:11.769 --> 00:41:14.872 region:rollup2
PROVIDE ITS WHEREABOUTS YOU

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:16.207 region:rollup2
COULD ALSO PROVIDE DETAILED REAL

00:41:14.872 --> 00:41:18.509 region:rollup2
TIME DATA REPORTS ABOUT WHERE

00:41:16.207 --> 00:41:20.545 region:rollup2
TRAPS ARE SET.

00:41:18.509 --> 00:41:22.413 region:rollup2
NOW WE HAVE ROPE REALPLUS THOSE

00:41:20.545 --> 00:41:24.215 region:rollup2
ARE AMY OF ROPE WAS POP UP LUIS

00:41:22.413 --> 00:41:25.783 region:rollup2
AS AN EXAMPLE OF ONE HERE.

00:41:24.215 --> 00:41:27.518 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S NOT VERY EXCITING

00:41:25.783 --> 00:41:28.820 region:rollup2
OPTION BECAUSE YOU ELIMINATE THE

00:41:27.518 --> 00:41:30.822 region:rollup2
VERTICAL LINES IN THE WATER

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:32.357 region:rollup2
PREVENTING ANY ENTANGLEMENTS.

00:41:30.822 --> 00:41:33.891 region:rollup2
I ALSO SEE THIS AS A BONUS TO

00:41:32.357 --> 00:41:35.460 region:rollup2
FISHERMEN BECAUSE.

00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:38.262 region:rollup2
THEY LIKE TO KEEP THEIR FISHING

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:39.397 region:rollup2
SPOTS SECRET SO THIS WOULD YOU

00:41:38.262 --> 00:41:40.331 region:rollup2
KNOW PREVENT OTHER FISH AMENDED

00:41:39.397 --> 00:41:41.466 region:rollup2
FOR COMING INTO THE AREA SEEING

00:41:40.331 --> 00:41:43.101 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY HAVE PLACED THEIR

00:41:41.466 --> 00:41:45.169 region:rollup2
TRAPS SO I SEE THIS AS A BENEFIT

00:41:43.101 --> 00:41:46.604 region:rollup2
TO FISHERMEN.

00:41:45.169 --> 00:41:48.006 region:rollup2
AND ANOTHER POSSIBLE SOLUTION

00:41:46.604 --> 00:41:49.741 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED IS

00:41:48.006 --> 00:41:53.344 region:rollup2
BIODEGRADABLE ROPE.

00:41:49.741 --> 00:41:54.812 region:rollup2
APPARENTLY THE.

00:41:53.344 --> 00:41:55.646 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE ENTANGLEMENTS OCCUR

00:41:54.812 --> 00:41:57.648 region:rollup2
MOST OF ENTITLEMENTS ACROSS THE

00:41:55.646 --> 00:41:59.017 region:rollup2
FIRST THIRTY FATHOMS OF THE LINE

00:41:57.648 --> 00:42:00.718 region:rollup2
OF THOSE OFFERS HUNDRED AND

00:41:59.017 --> 00:42:02.253 region:rollup2
EIGHTY FEET OF LINE.

00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:04.155 region:rollup2
AND THOSE FIRST THIRTY FATHOMS A

00:42:02.253 --> 00:42:05.623 region:rollup2
ROPE COULD BE REPLACED BY A

00:42:04.155 --> 00:42:06.457 region:rollup2
DISSOLVED OR BREAK AWAY LINE

00:42:05.623 --> 00:42:08.092 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S ANOTHER.

00:42:06.457 --> 00:42:09.527 region:rollup2
IDEA THAT'S BEEN THROWN AROUND

00:42:08.092 --> 00:42:10.695 region:rollup2
AROUND.

00:42:09.527 --> 00:42:12.163 region:rollup2
FINALLY ANOTHER SOLUTION WHICH

00:42:10.695 --> 00:42:13.931 region:rollup2
ADDRESSES THE CONCENTRATION OF

00:42:12.163 --> 00:42:14.999 region:rollup2
TRAPS IS HAVING THE SEASON

00:42:13.931 --> 00:42:16.801 region:rollup2
OPENER ON THE SAME DAY ACROSS

00:42:14.999 --> 00:42:18.336 region:rollup2
EVERY DISTRICT.

00:42:16.801 --> 00:42:20.104 region:rollup2
THIS PAST YEAR SOME DISTRICTS

00:42:18.336 --> 00:42:21.873 region:rollup2
OPEN ON NOVEMBER FIFTEENTH WHILE

00:42:20.104 --> 00:42:23.241 region:rollup2
OTHERS OPENED ON DECEMBER FIRST.

00:42:21.873 --> 00:42:24.342 region:rollup2
CHOOSING ONE DATE WOULD BE A

00:42:23.241 --> 00:42:26.010 region:rollup2
SAVING GRACE FOR SMALLER LOCAL

00:42:24.342 --> 00:42:27.111 region:rollup2
FISHING COMMUNITIES

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:28.513 region:rollup2
AS IT WOULD PREVENT LARGER

00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:29.981 region:rollup2
VESSELS FROM OUT FROM OTHER

00:42:28.513 --> 00:42:31.249 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS FROM FISHING OUT LOCAL

00:42:29.981 --> 00:42:32.183 region:rollup2
AREAS ROOF ROOF BEFORE RETURNING

00:42:31.249 --> 00:42:33.918 region:rollup2
TO THEIR DISTRICT.

00:42:32.183 --> 00:42:35.153 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR OPENING.

00:42:33.918 --> 00:42:37.221 region:rollup2
THIS GIVES LARGER FLEETS AN

00:42:35.153 --> 00:42:38.423 region:rollup2
UNFAIR ADVANTAGE.

00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:40.091 region:rollup2
THIS PAST YEAR I WENT OUT WITH

00:42:38.423 --> 00:42:41.459 region:rollup2
THE FISHERMEN TWO WEEKS AFTER

00:42:40.091 --> 00:42:43.127 region:rollup2
THE OPENING AND ALREADY THERE

00:42:41.459 --> 00:42:44.462 region:rollup2
WAS A HUGE DECLINING CRAB THE

00:42:43.127 --> 00:42:46.030 region:rollup2
FISHERMAN EXPLAINED HOW THE HOW

00:42:44.462 --> 00:42:47.532 region:rollup2
THE LARGEST HARVEST.

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:48.166 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL TO MAKE THE MOST MONEY

00:42:47.532 --> 00:42:49.801 region:rollup2
IS RIGHT AFTER THE START OF THE

00:42:48.166 --> 00:42:51.736 region:rollup2
SEASON.

00:42:49.801 --> 00:42:53.304 region:rollup2
SO I REALLY SEE THIS SEASON

00:42:51.736 --> 00:42:54.105 region:rollup2
OPENING WITH IT WITH A HUGE

00:42:53.304 --> 00:42:55.540 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATION OF TRAPS BEING.

00:42:54.105 --> 00:42:57.442 region:rollup2
.

00:42:55.540 --> 00:43:04.015 region:rollup2
A REALLY ABOUT A BIG PROBLEM IN

00:42:57.442 --> 00:43:05.616 region:rollup2
THE CAUSE OF THE ENTANGLEMENTS.

00:43:04.015 --> 00:43:07.151 region:rollup2
AND SO HERE ARE VARIOUS PAPA

00:43:05.616 --> 00:43:08.286 region:rollup2
BUOYS WHICH WERE CREATED TO

00:43:07.151 --> 00:43:09.887 region:rollup2
SERVE THE NEEDS FOR IMPROVE

00:43:08.286 --> 00:43:12.623 region:rollup2
SAFETY IN THE WATER BY REMOVING

00:43:09.887 --> 00:43:14.559 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL DANGEROUS SURFACE

00:43:12.623 --> 00:43:15.093 region:rollup2
MARKER BUOYS AND THERE ARE.

00:43:14.559 --> 00:43:16.928 region:rollup2
VARIOUS.

00:43:15.093 --> 00:43:18.362 region:rollup2
REASONS THAT THIS IS DANGEROUS

00:43:16.928 --> 00:43:21.065 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW BOATS PASSING AT NIGHT.

00:43:18.362 --> 00:43:23.067 region:rollup2
CAN GET.

00:43:21.065 --> 00:43:25.136 region:rollup2
THERE PROP CAUGHT IN THAT.

00:43:23.067 --> 00:43:26.838 region:rollup2
WALES UNTANGLED THAT I'D SEE

00:43:25.136 --> 00:43:27.738 region:rollup2
TOWARDS UNTANGLED SO THAT WE

00:43:26.838 --> 00:43:30.508 region:rollup2
REALLY LOOK LIKE THE SPIDEY OF

00:43:27.738 --> 00:43:32.210 region:rollup2
POP UPS.

00:43:30.508 --> 00:43:32.944 region:rollup2
IN CLOSING ELIMINATING VERTICAL

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:34.879 region:rollup2
LINES IN THE WATER WOULD AND

00:43:32.944 --> 00:43:36.647 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ENTANGLEMENTS.

00:43:34.879 --> 00:43:38.416 region:rollup2
FUNDING IS NEEDED FOR TESTING OF

00:43:36.647 --> 00:43:40.151 region:rollup2
THE VARIOUS OPTIONS.

00:43:38.416 --> 00:43:41.219 region:rollup2
OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGY WE WANT

00:43:40.151 --> 00:43:42.954 region:rollup2
TO TAKE FOR STEPS TODAY TO

00:43:41.219 --> 00:43:44.989 region:rollup2
DEVELOP A LONG TERM. PLANS

00:43:42.954 --> 00:43:46.257 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT PROVEN TECHNOLOGIES

00:43:44.989 --> 00:43:47.925 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOLUTIONS THAT EXIST

00:43:46.257 --> 00:43:48.559 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THAT COULD STOP WILL

00:43:47.925 --> 00:43:50.595 region:rollup2
ENTANGLEMENTS AND WOULD LIKE TO

00:43:48.559 --> 00:43:52.196 region:rollup2
URGE. ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN THE

00:43:50.595 --> 00:43:53.331 region:rollup2
STATE TO TAKE STEPS TO SEE HOW

00:43:52.196 --> 00:43:53.965 region:rollup2
WE CAN USE THIS TECHNOLOGY TO

00:43:53.331 --> 00:43:56.834 region:rollup2
SOLVE THE PROBLEMS

00:43:53.965 --> 00:44:01.272 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:43:56.834 --> 00:44:06.444 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

.

00:44:08.312 --> 00:44:15.086 region:rollup2
JUST A BIT OF HISTORY ABOUT.

00:44:11.048 --> 00:44:17.054 region:rollup2
PRODUCT THAT DUH I INVENTED.

00:44:15.086 --> 00:44:17.922 region:rollup2
ABOUT CITIES A GUY.

00:44:17.054 --> 00:44:21.526 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF I.

00:44:17.922 --> 00:44:22.960 region:rollup2
ENTANGLEMENTS LE ONE NIGHTS

00:44:21.526 --> 00:44:24.362 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN ON THE WATER AROUND

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:26.631 region:rollup2
AND ABOUT WAS DISABLED AND

00:44:24.362 --> 00:44:27.131 region:rollup2
NEARLY LOST BECAUSE OF

00:44:26.631 --> 00:44:27.598 region:rollup2
ENTANGLEMENT IN FISHING

00:44:27.131 --> 00:44:30.201 region:rollup2
GEAR.AND.

00:44:27.598 --> 00:44:33.237 region:rollup2
.

00:44:30.201 --> 00:44:34.972 region:rollup2
PROBABLY A BAD I USE LYDA ALL

00:44:33.237 --> 00:44:35.573 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DID SOMETHING ABOUT MOM

00:44:34.972 --> 00:44:38.709 region:rollup2
IDEA.

00:44:35.573 --> 00:44:39.977 region:rollup2
AND IT WAS BECAUSE OF.

00:44:38.709 --> 00:44:40.945 region:rollup2
THE APPLICATIONS I WOULD SAY IN

00:44:39.977 --> 00:44:43.147 region:rollup2
ONE OF THEM WAS WHILE

00:44:40.945 --> 00:44:47.084 region:rollup2
ENTANGLEMENT AS WELL UNITS STRIA

00:44:43.147 --> 00:44:49.921 region:rollup2
AND ALSO SAFETY REASONS.

00:44:47.084 --> 00:44:51.189 region:rollup2
WE MIGHT EFFORTS BACKING NAUGHTY

00:44:49.921 --> 00:44:52.490 region:rollup2
NAUGHTY AYE TO THE IT'S RYAN

00:44:51.189 --> 00:44:55.259 region:rollup2
DEFENSE DEPARTMENT.

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:56.994 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY THE.

00:44:55.259 --> 00:44:58.362 region:rollup2
FISHING INDUSTRY.

00:44:56.994 --> 00:44:59.130 region:rollup2
WASN'T INTERESTED IN AB

00:44:58.362 --> 00:45:01.265 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY BACK THEN.

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:03.301 region:rollup2
.

00:45:01.265 --> 00:45:05.436 region:rollup2
NOW FOR VARIOUS REASONS.

00:45:03.301 --> 00:45:06.804 region:rollup2
AND.

00:45:05.436 --> 00:45:09.006 region:rollup2
WHO US TWENTY YEARS WE'VE BEEN

00:45:06.804 --> 00:45:11.442 region:rollup2
SELLING NOW POP UP BOYS TO?

00:45:09.006 --> 00:45:15.046 region:rollup2
?

00:45:11.442 --> 00:45:16.881 region:rollup2
A FRIEND'S PROM RESEARCH AND HOW

00:45:15.046 --> 00:45:18.282 region:rollup2
OR WHEN GAS.

00:45:16.881 --> 00:45:20.618 region:rollup2
WE MIGHT HAVE FOODS OUT TO THE.

00:45:18.282 --> 00:45:22.353 region:rollup2
U. S. DIFFERENCE THE PROBLEM IN

00:45:20.618 --> 00:45:23.321 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE.

00:45:22.353 --> 00:45:25.356 region:rollup2
AND.

00:45:23.321 --> 00:45:27.558 region:rollup2
SINCE THEN WE'VE BEEN SELLING

00:45:25.356 --> 00:45:29.727 region:rollup2
TO THEM ON AND OFF.

00:45:27.558 --> 00:45:31.796 region:rollup2
THE LAST ORDER THAT WE SUPPLIED

00:45:29.727 --> 00:45:34.865 region:rollup2
WAS THREE WEEKS AGO.

00:45:31.796 --> 00:45:37.468 region:rollup2
AND LUCK WAS WITH THE US RIDE

00:45:34.865 --> 00:45:38.869 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE DEPARTMENT. WILL SAID

00:45:37.468 --> 00:45:42.974 region:rollup2
SO TO.

AND.

00:45:43.307 --> 00:45:47.011 region:rollup2
BILL JUNE WHICH WAS GRAYSON WAY

00:45:45.209 --> 00:45:50.514 region:rollup2
AS WELL.

00:45:47.011 --> 00:45:52.216 region:rollup2
SORRY AT TECHNOLOGIES.

00:45:50.514 --> 00:45:54.485 region:rollup2
NO WE FEEL WAS BEEN PROVEN OF

00:45:52.216 --> 00:45:55.353 region:rollup2
THE LAST TWENTY YEARS.

00:45:54.485 --> 00:45:57.388 region:rollup2
PSYOP POP UP BOY.

00:45:55.353 --> 00:45:59.357 region:rollup2
.

00:45:57.388 --> 00:46:01.459 region:rollup2
IF WHOSE BRAIN USE DUH CERTAINLY

00:45:59.357 --> 00:46:02.827 region:rollup2
NOT WELLS WOULD BE ENTANGLED IN

00:46:01.459 --> 00:46:04.962 region:rollup2
ANY OF THOSE LINES.

00:46:02.827 --> 00:46:06.964 region:rollup2
WE'VE.

00:46:04.962 --> 00:46:08.366 region:rollup2
RESEARCH STILL BEEN INVOLVED IN

00:46:06.964 --> 00:46:10.334 region:rollup2
THAT MARKET FOR THE TWENTIES WE

00:46:08.366 --> 00:46:11.936 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME.

00:46:10.334 --> 00:46:14.739 region:rollup2
GREAT AUNTIES AND.

00:46:11.936 --> 00:46:17.842 region:rollup2
HAVE WE CAN HELP THE INDUSTRY.

00:46:14.739 --> 00:46:19.610 region:rollup2
WE UNDERSTOOD PROBABLY TEN

00:46:17.842 --> 00:46:22.046 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THAT.

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:24.348 region:rollup2
THE MARKET DOES NOT EXIST ON TO.

00:46:22.046 --> 00:46:26.917 region:rollup2
SOMEONE.

00:46:24.348 --> 00:46:27.685 region:rollup2
SAYS THAT THE FISHERMEN REALLY

00:46:26.917 --> 00:46:29.020 region:rollup2
NAY TO USAID SINGS.

00:46:27.685 --> 00:46:30.621 region:rollup2
.

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:31.255 region:rollup2
WE'VE INTRODUCED IT TO THE

00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:31.989 region:rollup2
FISHERMEN OF.

00:46:31.255 --> 00:46:33.991 region:rollup2
MANY HE'S.

00:46:31.989 --> 00:46:36.093 region:rollup2
.

00:46:33.991 --> 00:46:37.695 region:rollup2
AND THE RESPONSE WE HAVE IS A

00:46:36.093 --> 00:46:39.063 region:rollup2
IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT BUT.

00:46:37.695 --> 00:46:40.898 region:rollup2
NO ONE REALLY WHICH IS TO

00:46:39.063 --> 00:46:42.833 region:rollup2
COMMIT SAWS.

00:46:40.898 --> 00:46:44.635 region:rollup2
WE HE'D JUST DECIDE THAT.

00:46:42.833 --> 00:46:46.570 region:rollup2
.

00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:48.239 region:rollup2
THERE'S TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:48.806 region:rollup2
THAT DOES WORK.

00:46:48.239 --> 00:46:51.976 region:rollup2
AND COULD SOLVE THIS PROBLEM

00:46:48.806 --> 00:46:54.812 region:rollup2
SON.

00:46:51.976 --> 00:46:55.713 region:rollup2
.

00:46:54.812 --> 00:47:03.487 region:rollup2
IT. COULD.

THANK YOU.

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:08.125 region:rollup2
IS SO.

00:47:04.622 --> 00:47:08.359 region:rollup2
WE WE DO DISENTANGLE MEANT WORK

00:47:08.125 --> 00:47:10.261 region:rollup2
UNDER.

00:47:08.359 --> 00:47:11.429 region:rollup2
NO IS A FLORIDA WERE ACTUALLY

00:47:10.261 --> 00:47:13.531 region:rollup2
TRAINED BY NO ADDED TO.

00:47:11.429 --> 00:47:13.998 region:rollup2
DISENTANGLE WELLS AND ON PART

00:47:13.531 --> 00:47:16.634 region:rollup2
OF THE.

00:47:13.998 --> 00:47:18.669 region:rollup2
NETWORK OF TEAMS.

00:47:16.634 --> 00:47:21.572 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE UNITED STATES THAT.

00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:22.340 region:rollup2
DO THESE DISENTANGLE METS.

00:47:21.572 --> 00:47:23.607 region:rollup2
AND.

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:25.309 region:rollup2
I CAN TELL YOU IT'S

00:47:23.607 --> 00:47:27.044 region:rollup2
HEARTBREAKING TO SEE THESE

00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:28.312 region:rollup2
ANIMALS UNTANGLE WE HAD OUT WE

00:47:27.044 --> 00:47:29.213 region:rollup2
HAD A WELL YESTERDAY THAT WAS

00:47:28.312 --> 00:47:30.514 region:rollup2
ENTANGLED RIGHT OFF OF DANA

00:47:29.213 --> 00:47:31.215 region:rollup2
POINT.

00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:33.918 region:rollup2
THAT WE.

00:47:31.215 --> 00:47:36.420 region:rollup2
TRIED TO HELP BUT WE FAILED.

00:47:33.918 --> 00:47:37.521 region:rollup2
AND THIS HAPPENS OVER AND OVER

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:39.323 region:rollup2
AND OVER AGAIN.

00:47:37.521 --> 00:47:40.858 region:rollup2
THE MONEY NEEDS TO BE SPENT ON

00:47:39.323 --> 00:47:42.960 region:rollup2
PREVENTION.

00:47:40.858 --> 00:47:44.128 region:rollup2
A I'M GLAD YOU GUYS ARE GIVING

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:46.363 region:rollup2
US MONEY FOR.

00:47:44.128 --> 00:47:47.898 region:rollup2
FOR THE TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT OF

00:47:46.363 --> 00:47:49.767 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S A BLESSING AND WE

00:47:47.898 --> 00:47:51.102 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH.

00:47:49.767 --> 00:47:52.336 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN NEEDED THAT WE HAD TO

00:47:51.102 --> 00:47:53.804 region:rollup2
SPEND OUR OWN MONEY FOR A LOT OF

00:47:52.336 --> 00:47:54.271 region:rollup2
YEARS TO DO THIS.

00:47:53.804 --> 00:47:56.040 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:47:54.271 --> 00:47:58.209 region:rollup2
THERE NEEDS TO BE A LOT OF

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:59.610 region:rollup2
MONEY SPENT ON PREVENTION OF

00:47:58.209 --> 00:48:02.646 region:rollup2
THIS PROBLEM THERE'S.

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:04.181 region:rollup2
JUST A HUGE HUGE PROBLEM.

00:48:02.646 --> 00:48:06.217 region:rollup2
AND WE WERE JUST REALLY.

00:48:04.181 --> 00:48:08.886 region:rollup2
.

00:48:06.217 --> 00:48:10.321 region:rollup2
SEEING SO MANY WELLS IN TANGLED

00:48:08.886 --> 00:48:11.856 region:rollup2
AYE I HAD.

00:48:10.321 --> 00:48:13.424 region:rollup2
A FEW YEARS AGO I HAD A BLUE

00:48:11.856 --> 00:48:14.658 region:rollup2
WELL THAT WAS ENTANGLED.

00:48:13.424 --> 00:48:15.059 region:rollup2
AND.

00:48:14.658 --> 00:48:17.828 region:rollup2
WE.

00:48:15.059 --> 00:48:18.229 region:rollup2
WHERE WE ARE UNABLE TO HELP IT?

00:48:17.828 --> 00:48:20.631 region:rollup2
AND.

00:48:18.229 --> 00:48:23.300 region:rollup2
THEWELL PROBABLY DIED AND

00:48:20.631 --> 00:48:25.603 region:rollup2
ANOTHER WELL THAT WAS ANOTHER

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:27.805 region:rollup2
BLUE WELL THAT WAS ENTANGLED.

00:48:25.603 --> 00:48:29.573 region:rollup2
NOAH DIDN'T PUT IT TRACKING

00:48:27.805 --> 00:48:31.342 region:rollup2
BILLY ON.

00:48:29.573 --> 00:48:33.077 region:rollup2
AND THAT THEY HAD ONE BUT THEY

00:48:31.342 --> 00:48:33.744 region:rollup2
DIDN'T PUT IT ON THERE AND I

00:48:33.077 --> 00:48:35.546 region:rollup2
ARGUED WITH THEM ONE OF THEM TO

00:48:33.744 --> 00:48:36.747 region:rollup2
PUT IT ON. BUT THEY WOULDN'T PUT

00:48:35.546 --> 00:48:38.315 region:rollup2
IT ON AND WHY.

00:48:36.747 --> 00:48:39.550 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY WERE UNSURE OF

00:48:38.315 --> 00:48:41.218 region:rollup2
WHETHER THE WHALE WOULD GO OFF

00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:42.520 region:rollup2
TO SEE.

00:48:41.218 --> 00:48:44.455 region:rollup2
AND THIS BILL ANYWAYS FIFTY

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:45.122 region:rollup2
POUNDS.

00:48:44.455 --> 00:48:47.024 region:rollup2
AND THE BULLY.

00:48:45.122 --> 00:48:49.326 region:rollup2
TEARS INTO THE FLESH OF THE

00:48:47.024 --> 00:48:50.227 region:rollup2
WELL SAID BECAUSE IT HUESO MUCH

00:48:49.326 --> 00:48:51.695 region:rollup2
SO I WORKED ON DESIGNING A NEW

00:48:50.227 --> 00:48:53.197 region:rollup2
BOOTY.

00:48:51.695 --> 00:48:57.535 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ONLY WEIGHS ELEVEN

00:48:53.197 --> 00:48:57.535 region:rollup2
POUNDS AND IT'S GREAT HOWEVER

00:48:57.601 --> 00:49:00.905 region:rollup2
WHAT THE GOVERNMENT?

00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:02.139 region:rollup2
OF THE UNITED STATES CAN'T MAKE

00:49:00.905 --> 00:49:03.574 region:rollup2
A BUOY THAT WEIGHS LESS THAN

00:49:02.139 --> 00:49:05.342 region:rollup2
FIFTY POUNDS.

00:49:03.574 --> 00:49:07.011 region:rollup2
I MEAN THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

00:49:05.342 --> 00:49:09.280 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH EFFORT BEING

00:49:07.011 --> 00:49:11.816 region:rollup2
SPENT ON THESE ANIMALS.

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:13.350 region:rollup2
TO HELP THEM AND WE NEED A WE

00:49:11.816 --> 00:49:14.985 region:rollup2
NEED MORE ATTENTION BEING PAID

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:16.821 region:rollup2
TO THIS.

00:49:14.985 --> 00:49:18.556 region:rollup2
IF THEY WERE SEVENTY ONE WHAT OF

00:49:16.821 --> 00:49:20.157 region:rollup2
WHALES BEING COACHED BY POACHERS

00:49:18.556 --> 00:49:22.159 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW.

00:49:20.157 --> 00:49:24.094 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH WOULD WE SPEND ON LAW

00:49:22.159 --> 00:49:25.362 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT TO STOP THAT?

00:49:24.094 --> 00:49:27.131 region:rollup2
NOT HOW MUCH ATTENTION WOULD BE

00:49:25.362 --> 00:49:28.332 region:rollup2
PAID TO IT. THIS IS A SERIOUS

00:49:27.131 --> 00:49:29.300 region:rollup2
PROBLEM AND IT'S TOTALLY

00:49:28.332 --> 00:49:31.535 region:rollup2
SOLVABLE.

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:32.670 region:rollup2
THIS MAN RIGHT HERE.

00:49:31.535 --> 00:49:34.004 region:rollup2
HE HAS A BULLY I DON'T I DON'T

00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:35.439 region:rollup2
WORK FORM.

00:49:34.004 --> 00:49:37.074 region:rollup2
HE'S JUST ITS HIS OWN BUSINESS

00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:38.776 region:rollup2
BUT HE HAS A BUOY THAT HE'S BEEN

00:49:37.074 --> 00:49:40.945 region:rollup2
USING FOR YEARS.

00:49:38.776 --> 00:49:42.880 region:rollup2
IT WORKS THERE'S NO REASON THAT

00:49:40.945 --> 00:49:44.048 region:rollup2
ALL THE FISHERMEN IN THIS WHOLE

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:45.850 region:rollup2
STATE COULDN'T BE USING THAT

00:49:44.048 --> 00:49:47.184 region:rollup2
BILLY. AND WE BASICALLY AND THE

00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:48.185 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

00:49:47.184 --> 00:49:49.386 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MOST OF THE

00:49:48.185 --> 00:49:51.288 region:rollup2
ENTANGLEMENTS THEY'RE HAPPENING

00:49:49.386 --> 00:49:52.990 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA MOST OF WHAT WE

00:49:51.288 --> 00:49:54.859 region:rollup2
SEE. IS FROM THESE.

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:56.660 region:rollup2
THESE

00:49:54.859 --> 00:49:57.595 region:rollup2
BOWIE'S WITH ROPES SO IF YOU

00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:59.463 region:rollup2
HAVE NO ROPE AND NO BUOY YOU

00:49:57.595 --> 00:50:01.198 region:rollup2
HAVE NO PROBLEM.

00:49:59.463 --> 00:50:01.398 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'VE GOT TO GET SOME

00:50:01.198 --> 00:50:03.200 region:rollup2
MONEY.

00:50:01.398 --> 00:50:03.734 region:rollup2
.

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:05.936 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW PUT TOWARDS THIS

00:50:03.734 --> 00:50:07.938 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

00:50:05.936 --> 00:50:10.508 region:rollup2
AND THE AND WE NEED TO TO HAVE

00:50:07.938 --> 00:50:11.775 region:rollup2
REQUIRED THE FISHERMEN.

00:50:10.508 --> 00:50:13.744 region:rollup2
TO USE THESE BUOYS AND GIVEN

00:50:11.775 --> 00:50:15.346 region:rollup2
FIVE YEARS OR WHATEVER TIME YOU

00:50:13.744 --> 00:50:17.081 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO GET EVERYTHING UP

00:50:15.346 --> 00:50:19.083 region:rollup2
AND RUNNING. AND THEN GIVE THEM

00:50:17.081 --> 00:50:20.985 region:rollup2
SOME HELP GIVING SOME SOME MONEY

00:50:19.083 --> 00:50:22.286 region:rollup2
TO PAY FOR THE BULLIES AND THE

00:50:20.985 --> 00:50:23.554 region:rollup2
PROBLEM SOLVED.

00:50:22.286 --> 00:50:25.155 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE'RE OUT THERE RISKING

00:50:23.554 --> 00:50:26.957 region:rollup2
OUR LIVES TRYING TO HELP WHALES

00:50:25.155 --> 00:50:27.992 region:rollup2
AND MOST THE TIME WE FAIL.

00:50:26.957 --> 00:50:29.760 region:rollup2
I MEAN I HAD TO MAKE A CHOICE

00:50:27.992 --> 00:50:32.296 region:rollup2
YESTERDAY GO SEE MY MOTHER IN

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:34.064 region:rollup2

THAT WAS MENTIONED IN THE

00:50:58.656 --> 00:51:01.025 region:rollup2
EARLIER PRESENTATION.

00:50:59.857 --> 00:51:01.492 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN A PART OF THAT GROUP

00:51:01.025 --> 00:51:02.593 region:rollup2
SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN

00:51:01.492 --> 00:51:04.695 region:rollup2
SEPTEMBER.

00:51:02.593 --> 00:51:05.796 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIFTEEN FOLLOWING THE

00:51:04.695 --> 00:51:07.264 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN THE OBSERVE

00:51:05.796 --> 00:51:08.065 region:rollup2
ENTANGLEMENTS OUT HERE IN

00:51:07.264 --> 00:51:08.899 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:51:08.065 --> 00:51:10.100 region:rollup2
I WANT TO.

00:51:08.899 --> 00:51:12.169 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHT THOUGH THAT THIS IS

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:13.871 region:rollup2
IN FACT A GLOBAL ISSUE THE ON

00:51:12.169 --> 00:51:14.905 region:rollup2
AND NOT UNINTENTIONAL.

00:51:13.871 --> 00:51:16.573 region:rollup2
ENTANGLEMENT OF WHALES AROUND

00:51:14.905 --> 00:51:17.808 region:rollup2
THE WORLD IS ONE OF THE.

00:51:16.573 --> 00:51:19.577 region:rollup2
IF NOT THE.

00:51:17.808 --> 00:51:21.078 region:rollup2
TOP SOURCE OF HUMAN CAUSED

00:51:19.577 --> 00:51:23.347 region:rollup2
MORTALITY FOR WELL POPULATIONS

00:51:21.078 --> 00:51:24.715 region:rollup2
MANY OF WHICH AS YOU KNOW ARE

00:51:23.347 --> 00:51:25.783 region:rollup2
THREATENED AYE OR ENDANGERED.

00:51:24.715 --> 00:51:26.684 region:rollup2
NOW THIS WORKING GROUP.

00:51:25.783 --> 00:51:28.085 region:rollup2
HIS FOLKS WE HAD THREE TOP

00:51:26.684 --> 00:51:30.187 region:rollup2
GOALS.

00:51:28.085 --> 00:51:32.923 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF THE NATURE OF.

00:51:30.187 --> 00:51:35.125 region:rollup2
OF DRIVERS FOR ENTANGLEMENT

00:51:32.923 --> 00:51:35.859 region:rollup2
RISK REDUCING ENTANGLEMENT RISK

00:51:35.125 --> 00:51:36.961 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT THAT'S WHERE WE

00:51:35.859 --> 00:51:38.462 region:rollup2
SPENT MOST OF OUR TIME

00:51:36.961 --> 00:51:39.296 region:rollup2
ELIMINATING THIS PROBLEM BY

00:51:38.462 --> 00:51:41.131 region:rollup2
AVOIDING ENTITLEMENTS IN THE

00:51:39.296 --> 00:51:42.533 region:rollup2
FIRST PLACE. AND THEN AS AN

00:51:41.131 --> 00:51:43.834 region:rollup2
EARLIER SPEAKER SAID IMPROVING

00:51:42.533 --> 00:51:44.702 region:rollup2
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE

00:51:43.834 --> 00:51:46.003 region:rollup2
RESPONSE WHEN.

00:51:44.702 --> 00:51:48.138 region:rollup2
WHALES ARE IN FACT.

00:51:46.003 --> 00:51:49.940 region:rollup2
ENTANGLED IN IN FISHING HERE SO

00:51:48.138 --> 00:51:50.741 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE THREE TOP GOALS I I

00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:52.943 region:rollup2
WILL SAY THAT THIS GROUP HAS

00:51:50.741 --> 00:51:53.978 region:rollup2
BEEN UNIQUE AND PRODUCTIVE IT'S

00:51:52.943 --> 00:51:55.145 region:rollup2
A MULTI STAKEHOLDER GROUPS OF

00:51:53.978 --> 00:51:55.813 region:rollup2
THE FEW FOLKS AROUND THE TABLE

00:51:55.145 --> 00:51:57.815 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO.

00:51:55.813 --> 00:51:59.116 region:rollup2
CONSERVATION GROUPS ARE.

00:51:57.815 --> 00:52:01.118 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL RECREATIONAL

REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL SO I

00:52:08.158 --> 00:52:11.261 region:rollup2
THINK IT ACTUALLY REPRESENTS A

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:12.396 region:rollup2
REALLY VALUABLE MODEL FOR HOW.

00:52:11.261 --> 00:52:14.131 region:rollup2
CITY CALIFORNIA CAN.

00:52:12.396 --> 00:52:15.799 region:rollup2
COALESCING ADDRESSING.

00:52:14.131 --> 00:52:16.633 region:rollup2
AN URGENT CONSERVATION ISSUE

00:52:15.799 --> 00:52:18.168 region:rollup2
LIKE THIS.

00:52:16.633 --> 00:52:19.570 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE STATE.

00:52:18.168 --> 00:52:20.771 region:rollup2
THE INDUSTRY MEMBERS OF THAT

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:22.172 region:rollup2
GROUP HAVE BEEN AT THE TABLE

00:52:20.771 --> 00:52:23.874 region:rollup2
FROM THE START AND AND REALLY

00:52:22.172 --> 00:52:25.509 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVE AND PROACTIVE IN.

00:52:23.874 --> 00:52:27.978 region:rollup2
HELPING TO IDENTIFY.

00:52:25.509 --> 00:52:28.379 region:rollup2
NEW WAYS TO TO ADDRESS THIS

00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:30.280 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

00:52:28.379 --> 00:52:31.382 region:rollup2
THIS WORK HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.616 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S OCEAN PROTECTION

00:52:31.382 --> 00:52:34.184 region:rollup2
COUNCIL ALONG WITH THE NATURE

00:52:32.616 --> 00:52:35.786 region:rollup2
CONSERVANCY. AND I JUST WANT TO

00:52:34.184 --> 00:52:36.420 region:rollup2
WALK THROUGH OUR PROGRESS IN THE

00:52:35.786 --> 00:52:37.521 region:rollup2
CHIEF AND ADVANCING THOSE THREE

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:38.789 region:rollup2
GOALS.

00:52:37.521 --> 00:52:40.124 region:rollup2
SO IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING THE

00:52:38.789 --> 00:52:41.959 region:rollup2
DRIVERS OF THIS RISK EVERYONE

00:52:40.124 --> 00:52:43.494 region:rollup2
THAT YOU COULD SEE THAT.

00:52:41.959 --> 00:52:44.862 region:rollup2
THAT CHART THAT WAS.

00:52:43.494 --> 00:52:45.696 region:rollup2
PRESENTED EARLIER THE TABLE

00:52:44.862 --> 00:52:47.164 region:rollup2
WITH REGARD TO INCREASE IN

00:52:45.696 --> 00:52:49.133 region:rollup2
OBSERVED ENTANGLEMENTS.

00:52:47.164 --> 00:52:49.133 region:rollup2
AND IT IT JUMPS RIGHT OUT AT

00:52:49.299 --> 00:52:51.101 region:rollup2
YOU AND IT JUMPED OUT AT

00:52:51.168 --> 00:52:53.504 region:rollup2
BY THE FALL TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT

00:52:52.936 --> 00:52:55.005 region:rollup2
SOMETHING NEW WAS HAPPENING

00:52:53.504 --> 00:52:56.040 region:rollup2
HERE.

00:52:55.005 --> 00:52:56.473 region:rollup2
AND SOMETHING NEED TO BE DONE

00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:57.908 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT.

00:52:56.473 --> 00:52:58.976 region:rollup2
SO THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL

00:52:57.908 --> 00:53:00.678 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE

00:52:58.976 --> 00:53:01.612 region:rollup2
CONVENE A MEETING WHICH LAUNCHED

00:53:00.678 --> 00:53:03.380 region:rollup2
THIS WORKING GROUP.

00:53:01.612 --> 00:53:05.082 region:rollup2
SINCE THAT TIME THAT THAT GROUP

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:07.217 region:rollup2
STARTED WITH HOW HOW WOULD WE

00:53:05.082 --> 00:53:08.085 region:rollup2
KNOW ABOUT THE DRIVERS FOR FOR

00:53:07.217 --> 00:53:09.353 region:rollup2
THAT PATTERN.

00:53:08.085 --> 00:53:10.387 region:rollup2
WHAT CAN WE LEARN AND WE REALLY

00:53:09.353 --> 00:53:12.056 region:rollup2
STARTED WITH INFORMATION

00:53:10.387 --> 00:53:13.490 region:rollup2
GATHERING AND COLLABORATIVE

00:53:12.056 --> 00:53:15.059 region:rollup2
RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND?

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:16.860 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS GOING ON IN TERMS THE

00:53:15.059 --> 00:53:17.728 region:rollup2
OCEAN YOU RECALL IT?

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.962 region:rollup2
OVER THESE THREE YEARS ARE

00:53:17.728 --> 00:53:21.098 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OCEAN

00:53:18.962 --> 00:53:21.665 region:rollup2
TEMPERATURES EL NINO EVENTS THE

00:53:21.098 --> 00:53:23.133 region:rollup2
WARM.

00:53:21.665 --> 00:53:24.134 region:rollup2
WATER BLAH THAT THAT SET OFF

00:53:23.133 --> 00:53:25.702 region:rollup2
THE COAST FOR SO LONG AND AND.

00:53:24.134 --> 00:53:27.504 region:rollup2
AND CHANGE SO MUCH IN OUR

00:53:25.702 --> 00:53:28.238 region:rollup2
OCEANS THAT ACTUALLY LEAD TO

00:53:27.504 --> 00:53:30.607 region:rollup2
CHANGES AND.

00:53:28.238 --> 00:53:31.875 region:rollup2
FOR IMPORTANTLY CREEL ANCHOVIES

00:53:30.607 --> 00:53:33.077 region:rollup2
AND SARDINES WITH CHEESE WELLS

00:53:31.875 --> 00:53:34.578 region:rollup2
ARE HERE TO FEED ON.

00:53:33.077 --> 00:53:35.612 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'RE ABLE TO SORT OF

00:53:34.578 --> 00:53:37.214 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE OCEAN

00:53:35.612 --> 00:53:38.382 region:rollup2
CHANGES MEANT FOR FORAGE WITH

00:53:37.214 --> 00:53:39.783 region:rollup2
THOSE SPORTS CHANGES MEANT FOR

00:53:38.382 --> 00:53:40.617 region:rollup2
THE WHALES AND THEN GATHER MORE

00:53:39.783 --> 00:53:42.252 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ON WHAT WAS

00:53:40.617 --> 00:53:44.054 region:rollup2
HAPPENING. IN PARALLEL WITH THE

00:53:42.252 --> 00:53:45.789 region:rollup2
CHANGE IN THE DYNAMICS OF THE

00:53:44.054 --> 00:53:47.458 region:rollup2
CRAB FISHERY SEASONALITY

00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:49.793 region:rollup2
INTIMIDATION THE EFFORT.

00:53:47.458 --> 00:53:52.529 region:rollup2
OF THAT FLEET HAS CHANGED OVER

00:53:49.793 --> 00:53:53.697 region:rollup2
THESE YEARS AS WELL.

00:53:52.529 --> 00:53:54.298 region:rollup2
AS WE TRY TO REALLY GET AT.

00:53:53.697 --> 00:53:55.666 region:rollup2
WHAT WERE THE OVERLAP OR THE

00:53:54.298 --> 00:53:57.067 region:rollup2
INTERSECTIONS BETWEEN SOME OF

00:53:55.666 --> 00:53:57.701 region:rollup2
THOSE CHANGES THAT WE'RE SEEING

00:53:57.067 --> 00:53:58.936 region:rollup2
IN THE WATER AND IN THE FISHERY

00:53:57.701 --> 00:54:00.504 region:rollup2
AND WHAT?

00:53:58.936 --> 00:54:02.039 region:rollup2
A WHY DID THEY RESULT OR HOW DID

00:54:00.504 --> 00:54:03.107 region:rollup2
THEY CONTRIBUTE TO THAT THE

00:54:02.039 --> 00:54:04.808 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN OBSERVING TANG WHAT

00:54:03.107 --> 00:54:05.642 region:rollup2
THEY WERE SEEING.

00:54:04.808 --> 00:54:07.111 region:rollup2
I ONE OF THE LAST THINGS I WANT

00:54:05.642 --> 00:54:08.745 region:rollup2
CALL OUT IN THIS SECTION IS A WE

00:54:07.111 --> 00:54:10.881 region:rollup2
DID A LOT OF ANALYSIS OF THE

00:54:08.745 --> 00:54:12.282 region:rollup2
IMAGES AND SOME OF THE STORIES

00:54:10.881 --> 00:54:13.550 region:rollup2
IN THE DISENTANGLE AND EFFORTS.

00:54:12.282 --> 00:54:14.418 region:rollup2
LEARNING AS MUCH AS WE COULD

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:16.253 region:rollup2
AND AND REALLY LEVERAGING THE

00:54:14.418 --> 00:54:16.854 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE THE HARVESTERS IN THE

00:54:16.253 --> 00:54:18.088 region:rollup2
ROOM.

00:54:16.854 --> 00:54:19.590 region:rollup2
TO BASICALLY DO FORENSIC

00:54:18.088 --> 00:54:21.225 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS OF WHAT WE COULD LEARN

00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:22.593 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE NATURE OF HOW I WHAT

00:54:21.225 --> 00:54:24.461 region:rollup2
FISHER WAS INVOLVED WHEN THAT

00:54:22.593 --> 00:54:25.262 region:rollup2
ATTAINMENT OCCURRED AND HOW THAT

00:54:24.461 --> 00:54:27.097 region:rollup2
WELL ACTUALLY INTERACTED WITH

00:54:25.262 --> 00:54:28.298 region:rollup2
THAT YOUR AND ENDED UP IN

00:54:27.097 --> 00:54:30.834 region:rollup2
ENTANGLED IN IT.

00:54:28.298 --> 00:54:32.369 region:rollup2
SO OUR NEXT GOAL WAS A REDUCING

00:54:30.834 --> 00:54:34.071 region:rollup2
THE RISK OF ENTANGLEMENT IN A

00:54:32.369 --> 00:54:36.006 region:rollup2
AFFORD FACING WHEN AND AS I SAID

00:54:34.071 --> 00:54:37.341 region:rollup2
THIS IS ON THE BULK OF OUR WORK.

00:54:36.006 --> 00:54:38.642 region:rollup2
EARLIER THEY MENTIONED THE.

00:54:37.341 --> 00:54:39.977 region:rollup2
SOMEONE MENTION THE BEST

00:54:38.642 --> 00:54:41.345 region:rollup2
PRACTICES GUIDE SO.

00:54:39.977 --> 00:54:43.213 region:rollup2
WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THAT

00:54:41.345 --> 00:54:43.814 region:rollup2
FORENSIC REVIEW OF OF IT PRIOR

00:54:43.213 --> 00:54:45.883 region:rollup2
ENTANGLEMENTS?

00:54:43.814 --> 00:54:47.251 region:rollup2
AND THE THE EXPERTISE OF.

00:54:45.883 --> 00:54:48.519 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE DISENTANGLE MEANT

00:54:47.251 --> 00:54:49.453 region:rollup2
RESPONDERS WAS THAT A LOT OF

00:54:48.519 --> 00:54:51.288 region:rollup2
THOSE INTERACTIONS WERE

00:54:49.453 --> 00:54:52.890 region:rollup2
HAPPENING AT THE SURFACE AT WHAT

00:54:51.288 --> 00:54:54.224 region:rollup2
IN THE THAT PART OF THAT CRAP.

00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:55.225 region:rollup2
SET UP THAT WE CALL THE TOP

00:54:54.224 --> 00:54:56.960 region:rollup2
HERE WHICH IS THE BUOYS AND

00:54:55.225 --> 00:54:58.028 region:rollup2
ROPES FLOATING I OFTEN AT THE

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:59.229 region:rollup2
SURFACE.

00:54:58.028 --> 00:55:00.531 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A RECOGNITION THAT.

00:54:59.229 --> 00:55:01.932 region:rollup2
FOLKS COULD.

00:55:00.531 --> 00:55:02.566 region:rollup2
TIGHTEN UP HOW THEY WERE DOING

00:55:01.932 --> 00:55:04.735 region:rollup2
THAT AND THEY WERE SORT OF.

00:55:02.566 --> 00:55:06.503 region:rollup2
I NEED FOR ESTABLISHED BEST

00:55:04.735 --> 00:55:08.005 region:rollup2
PRACTICES AND TO REDUCE THE

00:55:06.503 --> 00:55:09.640 region:rollup2
PROFILE OF THAT AND THEREBY

00:55:08.005 --> 00:55:11.241 region:rollup2
REDUCE THE RISK THAT AN ANIMAL

00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:12.676 region:rollup2
GET ENTANGLED IN THAT YEAR. SO

00:55:11.241 --> 00:55:14.178 region:rollup2
WITH THAT INDUSTRY WE DEVELOPED.

00:55:12.676 --> 00:55:15.412 region:rollup2
WITH INDUSTRY PARTNERS ABOUT

00:55:14.178 --> 00:55:16.413 region:rollup2
THAT BEST PRACTICES GUIDE IN

00:55:15.412 --> 00:55:17.181 region:rollup2
HAVE CIRCULATED THAT THROUGHOUT

00:55:16.413 --> 00:55:18.982 region:rollup2
THE FISHERY.

00:55:17.181 --> 00:55:20.117 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF THOSE QUALITIES

00:55:18.982 --> 00:55:22.085 region:rollup2
VOLUNTARY LOT OF.

00:55:20.117 --> 00:55:23.353 region:rollup2
THOSE PRACTICES HAVE.

00:55:22.085 --> 00:55:25.189 region:rollup2
HAVE INCREASED UP AND DOWN THE

00:55:23.353 --> 00:55:27.658 region:rollup2
COAST THE NEXT THING WE FOCUSED

00:55:25.189 --> 00:55:28.492 region:rollup2
ON IS LOST YOUR INITIATIVES SO

00:55:27.658 --> 00:55:30.093 region:rollup2
THE END OF THE SEASON WOULDN'T

00:55:28.492 --> 00:55:31.728 region:rollup2
SOMEONE MENTIONED A LOT HERE SO

00:55:30.093 --> 00:55:32.763 region:rollup2
I'D YEARS UNINTENTIONALLY LAS

00:55:31.728 --> 00:55:34.097 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES IT'S. DRAGGED UP BY

00:55:32.763 --> 00:55:35.732 region:rollup2
ANOTHER BOAT OR TUGBOAT ARE

00:55:34.097 --> 00:55:37.367 region:rollup2
MOVED BY STORM ARE STUCK.

00:55:35.732 --> 00:55:38.669 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE GOT SIGNIFICANTLY

00:55:37.367 --> 00:55:40.838 region:rollup2
INCREASED OUR INVESTMENTS.

00:55:38.669 --> 00:55:41.071 region:rollup2
IN ENSURING THAT ALL THAT

00:55:40.838 --> 00:55:42.573 region:rollup2
YOU'RE.

00:55:41.071 --> 00:55:43.373 region:rollup2
COMES OUT OF THE WATER AT THE

00:55:42.573 --> 00:55:44.675 region:rollup2
END OF THE SEASON IT DOESN'T

00:55:43.373 --> 00:55:46.376 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO REPRESENT A RISK OF

00:55:44.675 --> 00:55:47.911 region:rollup2
OF ENTITLEMENT MOVING FORWARD.

00:55:46.376 --> 00:55:50.113 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE INVESTING IN TOOLS.

00:55:47.911 --> 00:55:52.516 region:rollup2
AND PORTRAIT APPROACH JUST HELP

00:55:50.113 --> 00:55:55.185 region:rollup2
EXPEDITE AND IMPROVE THE SCALING

00:55:52.516 --> 00:55:55.552 region:rollup2
OF OF THOSE EFFORTS AND THAT

00:55:55.185 --> 00:55:56.353 region:rollup2
WORK IS ONGOING.

00:55:55.552 --> 00:55:56.787 region:rollup2
.

00:55:56.353 --> 00:55:58.255 region:rollup2
ALSO.

00:55:56.787 --> 00:56:00.157 region:rollup2
THIS GROUP HAS RECOMMENDED A

00:55:58.255 --> 00:56:01.325 region:rollup2
UNIFORM YOU'RE MARKING AND THIS

00:56:00.157 --> 00:56:02.893 region:rollup2
IS PART OF UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:56:01.325 --> 00:56:04.261 region:rollup2
THE NATURE THESE ENTANGLEMENTS.

00:56:02.893 --> 00:56:05.395 region:rollup2
THE CRAB FISHERY IS ONE PART OF

00:56:04.261 --> 00:56:06.897 region:rollup2
THIS PROBLEM BUT IT'S CERTAINLY

00:56:05.395 --> 00:56:07.731 region:rollup2
NOT THE ONLY FISH IN CALIFORNIA

00:56:06.897 --> 00:56:09.967 region:rollup2
THAT HAS.

00:56:07.731 --> 00:56:11.134 region:rollup2
CAUSED ENTANGLEMENTS NAM OR

00:56:09.967 --> 00:56:13.237 region:rollup2
ALONG THE WEST COAST FOR THAT

00:56:11.134 --> 00:56:15.072 region:rollup2
MATTER SO DIE UNIFORM.

00:56:13.237 --> 00:56:16.406 region:rollup2
FISHING GEAR MARKING WOULD GO A

00:56:15.072 --> 00:56:17.341 region:rollup2
LONG WAY TO HELPING US

00:56:16.406 --> 00:56:17.874 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND BUT WE DO HAVE AN

00:56:17.341 --> 00:56:20.077 region:rollup2
ENTANGLEMENT.

00:56:17.874 --> 00:56:21.511 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM

00:56:20.077 --> 00:56:22.880 region:rollup2
THAT IN ORDER TO PREVENT A

00:56:21.511 --> 00:56:23.847 region:rollup2
FUTURE ENTANGLEMENT SO THAT'S

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:25.515 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ARE CURRENTLY IN A

00:56:23.847 --> 00:56:27.818 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL I SP

00:56:25.515 --> 00:56:28.385 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN OH NINE WHICH IS MAKING

00:56:27.818 --> 00:56:29.152 region:rollup2
ITS WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS

00:56:28.385 --> 00:56:29.486 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW?

00:56:29.152 --> 00:56:31.255 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE.

00:56:29.486 --> 00:56:31.455 region:rollup2
MOST PRODUCTIVE I THINK WHAT

00:56:31.255 --> 00:56:33.156 region:rollup2
MOST.

00:56:31.455 --> 00:56:34.758 region:rollup2
.

00:56:33.156 --> 00:56:36.994 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY A HIGHEST IMPACT.

00:56:34.758 --> 00:56:38.795 region:rollup2
AREAS OF OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN IN

00:56:36.994 --> 00:56:40.097 region:rollup2
AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM.

00:56:38.795 --> 00:56:41.265 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS TAKING ALL THOSE

00:56:40.097 --> 00:56:42.199 region:rollup2
FACTORS THAT WE LEARNED WHAT'S

00:56:41.265 --> 00:56:43.600 region:rollup2
CHANGING IN THE OCEAN WHAT'S

00:56:42.199 --> 00:56:44.768 region:rollup2
CHANGING IN THE FORGE WHAT THE

00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:46.203 region:rollup2
WHALES DOING WITH THE FISHERY

00:56:44.768 --> 00:56:47.671 region:rollup2
DOING. AND CREATING BATES GOING

00:56:46.203 --> 00:56:49.039 region:rollup2
EARLY WARNING SYSTEM A

00:56:47.671 --> 00:56:51.308 region:rollup2
CHARACTERIZATION OF THE OF THE

00:56:49.039 --> 00:56:53.110 region:rollup2
YEAR SPECIFIC RISK WHAT WE KNOW

00:56:51.308 --> 00:56:53.877 region:rollup2
BASED ON THOSE FACTORS WE GET

00:56:53.110 --> 00:56:56.813 region:rollup2
SAY OKAY THIS IS THAT A

00:56:53.877 --> 00:56:58.448 region:rollup2
BASICALLY A NORMAL YEAR. OR WE

00:56:56.813 --> 00:56:58.982 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME MODERATE MODERATELY

00:56:58.448 --> 00:57:01.118 region:rollup2
ELEVATED RISK WE HAVE A

00:56:58.982 --> 00:57:02.219 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATED RISK I'M

00:57:01.118 --> 00:57:03.854 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO TAKE IMMEDIATE

00:57:02.219 --> 00:57:05.122 region:rollup2
MITIGATING STEPS SO WE'RE

00:57:03.854 --> 00:57:05.555 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING THIS FIRST OF ITS

00:57:05.122 --> 00:57:08.025 region:rollup2
KIND.

00:57:05.555 --> 00:57:09.860 region:rollup2
ADAPTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.

00:57:08.025 --> 00:57:11.461 region:rollup2
THAT WILL ALLOW US TO

00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:12.029 region:rollup2
CHARACTERIZE RISK AHEAD OF THE

00:57:11.461 --> 00:57:13.630 region:rollup2
SEASON AND DURING THE SEASON

00:57:12.029 --> 00:57:14.398 region:rollup2
AND.

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:16.166 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS MULTI STAKEHOLDER

00:57:14.398 --> 00:57:18.468 region:rollup2
PROCESS RECOMMEND TO.

00:57:16.166 --> 00:57:20.304 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATE MITIGATING STEPS NONE

00:57:18.468 --> 00:57:21.705 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD SO WERE PILOTING

00:57:20.304 --> 00:57:23.340 region:rollup2
THAT NOW WE'VE LEARNED A TON

00:57:21.705 --> 00:57:25.242 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT AND ON THAT THE MODEL

00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:25.943 region:rollup2
THEY THINK HAS REAL POTENTIAL TO

00:57:25.242 --> 00:57:26.810 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THESE ISSUES.

00:57:25.943 --> 00:57:28.879 region:rollup2
ACROSS FISHERIES IN CALIFORNIA

00:57:26.810 --> 00:57:30.447 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:57:28.879 --> 00:57:31.581 region:rollup2
I'M WE ARE SUPPORTING THE

00:57:30.447 --> 00:57:33.517 region:rollup2
WORKING GROUP IS POINTING AT

00:57:31.581 --> 00:57:34.084 region:rollup2
ONGOING RESEARCH INTO A NUMBER

00:57:33.517 --> 00:57:36.119 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF YOUR

00:57:34.084 --> 00:57:38.588 region:rollup2
INNOVATION REDUCING THE LINE

00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:39.856 region:rollup2
PROFILE USING BREAKAWAYS. I AND

00:57:38.588 --> 00:57:41.558 region:rollup2
OTHERS SOME WORK IN.

00:57:39.856 --> 00:57:43.060 region:rollup2
THE WE LIST OR ACOUSTIC RELEASE

00:57:41.558 --> 00:57:45.662 region:rollup2
TRAPS AT WORK HAVE BEEN TALKED

00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:46.963 region:rollup2
ABOUT HERE. I THINK THAT IS VERY

00:57:45.662 --> 00:57:48.465 region:rollup2
PROMISING WORK ON IT THAT AN

00:57:46.963 --> 00:57:49.366 region:rollup2
EXPERIMENTAL PHASE I THINK.

00:57:48.465 --> 00:57:50.968 region:rollup2
WE'RE.

00:57:49.366 --> 00:57:52.936 region:rollup2
VERY INTERESTED IN AND

00:57:50.968 --> 00:57:54.371 region:rollup2
EXPLORING THE MECHANICS THE

00:57:52.936 --> 00:57:55.972 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS THE COSTS TO THE THE

00:57:54.371 --> 00:57:57.507 region:rollup2
DOWNSIDE OF OF MOVING FORWARD IN

00:57:55.972 --> 00:57:58.809 region:rollup2
THAT DIRECTION BUT I DO THINK IT

00:57:57.507 --> 00:58:00.077 region:rollup2
IS PROMISING.

00:57:58.809 --> 00:58:01.378 region:rollup2
THE FINAL THING I AM IS

00:58:00.077 --> 00:58:03.180 region:rollup2
IMPROVING THE RESPONSE WE'VE

00:58:01.378 --> 00:58:04.281 region:rollup2
MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN

00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:05.716 region:rollup2
BUILDING THE HUMAN CAPACITY OF

00:58:04.281 --> 00:58:07.584 region:rollup2
ART THE CONTAINMENT NETWORK.

00:58:05.716 --> 00:58:08.618 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE HUNDRED AND WE'VE

00:58:07.584 --> 00:58:09.953 region:rollup2
DONE SEVERAL TRAININGS RESULTING

00:58:08.618 --> 00:58:11.755 region:rollup2
IN ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO

00:58:09.953 --> 00:58:13.123 region:rollup2
HUNDRED A NEW FIRST RESPONDERS

00:58:11.755 --> 00:58:14.825 region:rollup2
THESE ARE MOSTLY COMMERCIAL AND

00:58:13.123 --> 00:58:15.926 region:rollup2
RECREATIONAL FISHERMEN. WHO

THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA AND

01:00:15.412 --> 01:00:18.014 region:rollup2
TANGLED.

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:18.281 region:rollup2
IN THESE IN THESE FISHING NETS

01:00:18.014 --> 01:00:19.883 region:rollup2
AND ALSO.

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:21.218 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE ONES THAT THEY

01:00:19.883 --> 01:00:22.752 region:rollup2
DROPPED TWO HUNDRED FEET DOWN IN

01:00:21.218 --> 01:00:23.954 region:rollup2
THE OCEAN AND THEY KEEP IN THEIR

01:00:22.752 --> 01:00:25.155 region:rollup2
FOR TWELVE HOURS AND.

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:27.090 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY.

01:00:25.155 --> 01:00:28.692 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW. THERE'S SO MUCH BI

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:30.360 region:rollup2
CATCH THE GETS CAUGHT THAT

01:00:28.692 --> 01:00:31.094 region:rollup2
REALLY THERE'S NO ACCURATE COUNT

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.329 region:rollup2
SO.

01:00:31.094 --> 01:00:33.730 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE THE

01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:35.131 region:rollup2
FIGURES YOU KNOW I THINK IT WAS

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:36.199 region:rollup2
FROM TWO THOUSAND AND ONE TWO

01:00:35.131 --> 01:00:37.334 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FIFTEEN THERE WAS

01:00:36.199 --> 01:00:38.535 region:rollup2
LITERALLY. I THINK FIFTEEN

01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:40.237 region:rollup2
HUNDRED ANIMALS THAT THEY

01:00:38.535 --> 01:00:42.506 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY COUNTED.

01:00:40.237 --> 01:00:44.875 region:rollup2
OF WHICH YOU KNOW HOW CAN YOU

01:00:42.506 --> 01:00:46.843 region:rollup2
REALLY. GUESSTIMATE THAT

01:00:44.875 --> 01:00:48.178 region:rollup2
IF YOU CAN'T I MEAN WITH THE

01:00:46.843 --> 01:00:49.579 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF FISHING LINE RUNNING

01:00:48.178 --> 01:00:51.047 region:rollup2
MILES AND MILES AND MILES AND

01:00:49.579 --> 01:00:53.884 region:rollup2
THE OCEAN. THERE'S REALLY NO

01:00:51.047 --> 01:00:55.585 region:rollup2
ACCURATE WAY TO DO THAT SO.

01:00:53.884 --> 01:00:57.454 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MY QUESTION IS THAT

01:00:55.585 --> 01:00:59.689 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHY ISN'T THERE.

01:00:57.454 --> 01:01:00.690 region:rollup2
MORE FUNDING. PUT TOWARDS THIS

01:00:59.689 --> 01:01:02.592 region:rollup2
WHY.

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:03.160 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THESE ANIMALS ARE SOME

01:01:02.592 --> 01:01:03.593 region:rollup2
OF THEM ARE ON THE BRINK OF

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.896 region:rollup2
EXTINCTION.

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:07.831 region:rollup2
.

01:01:05.896 --> 01:01:08.798 region:rollup2
IF WE LOSE THESE ANIMALS WHAT

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:10.033 region:rollup2
WILL THE IMPACT SPEED A

01:01:08.798 --> 01:01:10.634 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA NOT ONLY JUST

01:01:10.033 --> 01:01:12.235 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BUT THE REST OF THE

01:01:10.634 --> 01:01:12.736 region:rollup2
WORLD.

01:01:12.235 --> 01:01:14.504 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:01:12.736 --> 01:01:15.705 region:rollup2
IS MONEY AND GREED REALLY THAT

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:19.276 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

01:01:15.705 --> 01:01:19.910 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT.

01:01:19.276 --> 01:01:21.745 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO PLACE MORE VALUE ON

01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:23.246 region:rollup2
LIFE. AND I THINK THAT GOES WITH

01:01:21.745 --> 01:01:24.180 region:rollup2
ALL ENDANGERED SPECIES ALL

01:01:23.246 --> 01:01:25.448 region:rollup2
ANIMALS WE SHARE THIS PLANET

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:27.651 region:rollup2
WITH EIGHT POINT SEVEN MILLION

01:01:25.448 --> 01:01:29.352 region:rollup2
SPECIES OF WHICH.

01:01:27.651 --> 01:01:31.021 region:rollup2
WE ONLY KNOW ABOUT THE REST UP

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:32.556 region:rollup2
TO A HUNDRED MILLION THAT ARE IN

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:33.123 region:rollup2
THE RAINFOREST OF WHICH WERE

01:01:32.556 --> 01:01:33.723 region:rollup2
CUTTING DOWN AT AN ALARMING

01:01:33.123 --> 01:01:34.658 region:rollup2
RATE.

01:01:33.723 --> 01:01:35.959 region:rollup2
GETS EVERY.

01:01:34.658 --> 01:01:37.928 region:rollup2
TWO FOOTBALL FIELDS EVERY HALF

01:01:35.959 --> 01:01:40.730 region:rollup2
AN HOUR.

01:01:37.928 --> 01:01:42.365 region:rollup2
FOR SOMETHING CALLED PALM OIL.

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:42.799 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE LOGGING IS

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:43.733 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ISSUE BUT.

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:45.635 region:rollup2
THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:47.137 region:rollup2
BALLGAME.

01:01:45.635 --> 01:01:48.872 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT THAT WE'RE PUTTING.

01:01:47.137 --> 01:01:50.440 region:rollup2
ON THE VALUE.

01:01:48.872 --> 01:01:52.876 region:rollup2
OF.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.878 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT.

01:01:52.876 --> 01:01:56.546 region:rollup2
WELL NOT OUTLIVE US.

01:01:54.878 --> 01:01:57.681 region:rollup2
DOESN'T COMPARE TO THE VALUE

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:58.348 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN PUT ON SOMETHING

01:01:57.681 --> 01:02:00.317 region:rollup2
THAT WILL OUTLIVE US.

01:01:58.348 --> 01:02:02.118 region:rollup2
WHICH IS LIFE.

01:02:00.317 --> 01:02:03.220 region:rollup2
SO.

01:02:02.118 --> 01:02:03.587 region:rollup2
WE LEAVE WITH COMPASSION I

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.988 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT.

01:02:03.587 --> 01:02:06.289 region:rollup2
.

01:02:04.988 --> 01:02:08.725 region:rollup2
BEING HERE IT'S IT'S A LOT OF

01:02:06.289 --> 01:02:09.559 region:rollup2
FIVE FIGURES AND NUMBERS AND.

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:11.127 region:rollup2
THIS RIGHT THING TO DO IN THIS

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:12.862 region:rollup2
IS BUSINESS.

01:02:11.127 --> 01:02:15.065 region:rollup2
WELL. YOU CAN'T TAKE BUSINESS

01:02:12.862 --> 01:02:15.999 region:rollup2
WITH YOU WHEN YOU DIE.

01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:17.567 region:rollup2
BUT YOU CAN LEAVE A LASTING

01:02:15.999 --> 01:02:19.302 region:rollup2
IMPRESSION.

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:20.570 region:rollup2
ON THIS PLANET AND THE REST OF

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:21.638 region:rollup2
THIS PLANET'S SPECIES AND IT'S

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:23.940 region:rollup2
NOT JUST FOR US IT'S NOT JUST

01:02:21.638 --> 01:02:24.908 region:rollup2
FOR HUMANS.

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:27.410 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS IS JUST WORK

01:02:24.908 --> 01:02:29.179 region:rollup2
RELEASING THIS LAND.

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:30.013 region:rollup2
THIS IS JUST THIS IS A GIFT AND

01:02:29.179 --> 01:02:32.682 region:rollup2
IF WE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THIS

01:02:30.013 --> 01:02:33.717 region:rollup2
GIFT THIS IS OUR ONLY PLANET.

01:02:32.682 --> 01:02:34.884 region:rollup2
TAKE CARE OF THIS PLANET BEFORE

01:02:33.717 --> 01:02:35.986 region:rollup2
WE GO TO VISIT OTHER PLANETS.

01:02:34.884 --> 01:02:37.954 region:rollup2
SO.

01:02:35.986 --> 01:02:38.521 region:rollup2
.

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:39.289 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING

01:02:38.521 --> 01:02:41.258 region:rollup2
HERE.

01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:42.692 region:rollup2
HA THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT

01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:44.561 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SEE A

01:02:42.692 --> 01:02:45.695 region:rollup2
PLANET WITHOUT THE SPECIES.

01:02:44.561 --> 01:02:46.796 region:rollup2
AND I REFUSE TO SEE A PLAN

01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:47.697 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THE SPECIES AND THAT'S

01:02:46.796 --> 01:02:50.166 region:rollup2
WHY WE'RE FIGHTING SO HARD.

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:50.900 region:rollup2
TO PROTECT THEM STEP.

01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:52.836 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR THAT BIT OF

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:54.738 region:rollup2
INSPIRATION AND IT CAN I SHARE

01:02:52.836 --> 01:02:56.439 region:rollup2
JUST ONE THING REAL QUICK.

01:02:54.738 --> 01:02:58.842 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE TO WRAP UP BUT JEFF

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:59.809 region:rollup2
YOU CAN DO IT FOR EQUITY ARE

01:02:58.842 --> 01:03:02.345 region:rollup2
HIGH WHAT I WANTED TO SAY IS

01:02:59.809 --> 01:03:04.214 region:rollup2
THAT I KNOW THAT THE FISHERMEN

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:05.482 region:rollup2
CARE ABOUT THESE ANIMALS AND

01:03:04.214 --> 01:03:07.417 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T WANT TO CATCH THEM.

01:03:05.482 --> 01:03:08.852 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THAT ALL THESE PEOPLE

01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:09.753 region:rollup2
IN THIS ROOM CARE I THINK

01:03:08.852 --> 01:03:11.187 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY WANTS TO SOLVE THE

01:03:09.753 --> 01:03:12.989 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

01:03:11.187 --> 01:03:15.325 region:rollup2
BUT THE PROBLEM IS.

01:03:12.989 --> 01:03:17.394 region:rollup2
THAT NO ONE CAN DECIDE ON HOW TO

01:03:15.325 --> 01:03:20.230 region:rollup2
DO IT. AND I THINK THAT.

01:03:17.394 --> 01:03:22.799 region:rollup2
WHAT WE NEED IS A SOLUTION THAT

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:24.801 region:rollup2
WE KNOW WORKS AND? HONESTLY THIS

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:26.636 region:rollup2
GUY HAS ONE THAT REALLY WORKS

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:28.238 region:rollup2
IT'S IT ALREADY IS IN PRACTICE

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:30.407 region:rollup2
IT'S BEING USED.

01:03:28.238 --> 01:03:30.807 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT A PROTOTYPE IT'S A

TO ACHIEVE ITS MISSION AND WE

01:11:52.008 --> 01:11:55.711 region:rollup2
DEFINE THIS AS THE MISSION LEVEL

01:11:53.409 --> 01:11:56.379 region:rollup2
IN THE DATA SET.

01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:58.281 region:rollup2

01:12:50.266 --> 01:12:53.269 region:rollup2
AND ANNUALLY WOULD REFRESHED.

01:12:51.734 --> 01:12:54.470 region:rollup2
THIS CURRENT SERVICE LEVEL SO

01:12:53.269 --> 01:12:55.972 region:rollup2
WILL ALWAYS HAVE A FRESH DATA

THE DATA GATHERING PROCESS.

01:13:29.272 --> 01:13:30.873 region:rollup2
THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST

01:13:30.306 --> 01:13:32.975 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT AND TIME CONSUMING

01:13:30.873 --> 01:13:34.577 region:rollup2
PHASE OF THE PROJECT.

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:57.827 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW IT MAY BE HARD FOR

01:14:56.359 --> 01:14:59.295 region:rollup2
SOME FOLKS TO SEE THE SUNAND

01:14:57.827 --> 01:15:00.796 region:rollup2
THE BACK HERE SO THIS KIND OF.

01:14:59.295 --> 01:15:02.331 region:rollup2
ILLUSTRATE WHAT WHAT THESE

01:15:00.796 --> 01:15:03.799 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ASPECTS ARE.

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:05.134 region:rollup2
THE UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER

01:15:03.799 --> 01:15:06.936 region:rollup2
MEASURES THE DISTRICTS CURRENT

01:15:05.134 --> 01:15:08.404 region:rollup2
SERVICE LEVEL NOT SHOWN THE TEAL

01:15:06.936 --> 01:15:10.573 region:rollup2
BLUE.

01:15:08.404 --> 01:15:13.142 region:rollup2
AGAINST ALL SERVICES OR VARIANTS

01:15:10.573 --> 01:15:14.543 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD BE THE BLACK.

01:15:13.142 --> 01:15:15.344 region:rollup2
THE RED SHOWS THE AVERAGE

01:15:14.543 --> 01:15:17.980 region:rollup2
SERVICE LEVEL ACROSS THIS

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:19.248 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS.

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:20.850 region:rollup2
THE FUEL GAUGE LOOKING GRAPH

01:15:19.248 --> 01:15:22.585 region:rollup2
BELOW THAT SHOWS OUR CURRENT

01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:24.053 region:rollup2
SERVICE LEVEL AGAINST MISSION

01:15:22.585 --> 01:15:25.621 region:rollup2
LEVELIN TERMS OF DOLLARS OR P.

01:15:24.053 --> 01:15:27.656 region:rollup2
WISE.

01:15:25.621 --> 01:15:28.958 region:rollup2
SO WE KNOW WHAT WE HAVE AND WHAT

01:15:27.656 --> 01:15:30.059 region:rollup2
THE NEED IS AND CAN USE THAT

01:15:28.958 --> 01:15:32.261 region:rollup2
INFORMATION TO BETTER ALLOCATE

01:15:30.059 --> 01:15:33.562 region:rollup2
OUR RESOURCES.

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:35.664 region:rollup2
ON THE RIGHT.

01:15:33.562 --> 01:15:37.900 region:rollup2
WE WE SHOW.

01:15:35.664 --> 01:15:38.734 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL PARKING AT VARIANCE

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:40.669 region:rollup2
IN TERMS RELATIVE TO OTHER PARTS

01:15:38.734 --> 01:15:42.371 region:rollup2
AND DISTRICTS.

01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:43.239 region:rollup2
IN OTHER WORDS WHICH PARKS THE

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:44.874 region:rollup2
MORE RESOURCE ALLOCATION THAN

01:15:43.239 --> 01:15:46.442 region:rollup2
OTHERS.

01:15:44.874 --> 01:15:48.477 region:rollup2
DEPICTED BY REDS OR GREEN SO THE

01:15:46.442 --> 01:15:49.078 region:rollup2
RATS WOULD NEED MORE RESOURCE

01:15:48.477 --> 01:15:56.519 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION THE GREENS WOULD BE

01:15:49.078 --> 01:15:57.553 region:rollup2
LESS.

01:15:56.519 --> 01:15:59.021 region:rollup2
SO AS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING S.

01:15:57.553 --> 01:16:00.022 region:rollup2
B. B. CAN BE USED FOR A VARIETY

01:15:59.021 --> 01:16:01.290 region:rollup2
OF PURPOSES INCLUDING A RESOURCE

01:16:00.022 --> 01:16:02.324 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION.

01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:03.692 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES

01:16:02.324 --> 01:16:05.528 region:rollup2
FORTY TWO MILLION TO ADDRESS

01:16:03.692 --> 01:16:07.329 region:rollup2
STATE PARK SERVICE LEVELS. AND

01:16:05.528 --> 01:16:09.498 region:rollup2
MATTER CONSISTENT WITH OUR STATE

01:16:07.329 --> 01:16:10.766 region:rollup2
PARKS REORGANIZATION.

01:16:09.498 --> 01:16:11.801 region:rollup2
FOR THE FIRST TIME STATE PARKS

01:16:10.766 --> 01:16:13.302 region:rollup2
WAS ABLE TO LOOK AT EXISTING

01:16:11.801 --> 01:16:14.703 region:rollup2
SERVICE LEVELS THROUGHOUT EVERY

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:15.871 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF THE ORGANIZATION.

01:16:14.703 --> 01:16:17.807 region:rollup2
DETERMINE WHERE BEST TO ALLOCATE

01:16:15.871 --> 01:16:18.607 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL FUNDS.

01:16:17.807 --> 01:16:20.543 region:rollup2
THE CHART ABOVE DISPLAYS

01:16:18.607 --> 01:16:21.577 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION OF FORTY TWO MILLION

01:16:20.543 --> 01:16:23.712 region:rollup2
OF STATE PARKS AND RECREATION

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:24.914 region:rollup2
FUND BY PROGRAM.

01:16:23.712 --> 01:16:26.615 region:rollup2
IN THE PAST WE COULD ONLY MAKE

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:28.451 region:rollup2
THIS PRESENTATION AT A DISTRICT

01:16:26.615 --> 01:16:29.452 region:rollup2
LEVEL AND RECENTLY A PARKING AT

01:16:28.451 --> 01:16:30.820 region:rollup2
LEVEL THROUGH AN EFFORT CALLED

01:16:29.452 --> 01:16:32.888 region:rollup2
PARK IN IT COSTING.

01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:34.056 region:rollup2
HOWEVER NEITHER OF THOSE EFFORTS

01:16:32.888 --> 01:16:36.058 region:rollup2
TO SPEAK TO PROGRAM OR SERVICE

01:16:34.056 --> 01:16:37.460 region:rollup2
AND A USEFUL MANNER.

01:16:36.058 --> 01:16:38.661 region:rollup2
THE HOPE HERE IS THAT THROUGHOUT

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:40.196 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS EFFORT WE CAN HAVE

01:16:38.661 --> 01:16:41.464 region:rollup2
MORE INFORMED CONVERSATIONS

01:16:40.196 --> 01:16:42.531 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT THE DEPARTMENT IS

01:16:41.464 --> 01:16:43.933 region:rollup2
DOING WITH THE APPROPRIATIONS IT

01:16:42.531 --> 01:16:45.134 region:rollup2
RECEIVES FROM THE LEGISLATURE.

01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:46.535 region:rollup2
AND MAKE INCREASINGLY BETTER

01:16:45.134 --> 01:16:49.805 region:rollup2
DECISIONS WITH THOSE FUNDS GOING

01:16:46.535 --> 01:16:51.173 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

01:16:49.805 --> 01:16:53.209 region:rollup2
AND THEN OUR POLY RAN SHORT ON

01:16:51.173 --> 01:16:54.043 region:rollup2
TIME SO LET US RECAP THAT. THE

01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:55.578 region:rollup2
BENEFITS OF S. B. B. AGAIN.

01:16:54.043 --> 01:16:57.113 region:rollup2
.

01:16:55.578 --> 01:16:57.980 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE GOT BETTER

01:16:57.113 --> 01:16:59.081 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION WITH THE

01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:00.649 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT ADMINISTRATION AND

01:16:59.081 --> 01:17:01.984 region:rollup2

AND THE PUBLIC.

01:17:03.786 --> 01:17:06.422 region:rollup2
WE HAVE INCREASED UNDERSTAND OF

01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:07.323 region:rollup2
WHICH STATE PARKS PROGRAMS ARE

01:17:06.422 --> 01:17:09.225 region:rollup2
FLOURISHING AND WHICH ONES NEED

01:17:07.323 --> 01:17:10.926 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL ALLOCATION.

01:17:09.225 --> 01:17:12.328 region:rollup2
COST TRANSPARENCY FOR THE

01:17:10.926 --> 01:17:13.863 region:rollup2

THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:58.394 region:rollup2
POSITIONS ON I THINK A COUPLE OF

01:19:56.592 --> 01:19:59.528 region:rollup2
REALLY KEY THINGS FOR US TO

01:19:58.394 --> 01:20:01.130 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHT IS THAT THE VAST

01:19:59.528 --> 01:20:02.931 region:rollup2
MAJORITY WHOSE POSITIONS NINETY

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:04.667 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THOSE POSITIONS. ARE

01:20:02.931 --> 01:20:05.901 region:rollup2
OUT IN THE FIELDS ON THAT WAS

01:20:04.667 --> 01:20:07.169 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY

01:20:05.901 --> 01:20:09.505 region:rollup2
WHERE WE CAN MUST DIRECTLY

01:20:07.169 --> 01:20:11.006 region:rollup2
IMPACT THE VISITOR'S EXPERIENCE.

01:20:09.505 --> 01:20:12.875 region:rollup2

01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:14.276 region:rollup2
ARE RANK AND FILE ON THAT WE

01:20:12.875 --> 01:20:15.244 region:rollup2
REALLY NEEDED MORE PEOPLE THAT

TAKING A LOOK AT HOW WE RESOURCE

01:24:11.179 --> 01:24:14.516 region:rollup2

MANNER CALIFORNIA STATE PARK

01:24:14.516 --> 01:24:17.386 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WE ALSO REVIEWED THIS

01:24:16.318 --> 01:24:19.021 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND IDENTIFIED

01:24:17.386 --> 01:24:20.856 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES TO STRENGTHEN IT

01:24:19.021 --> 01:24:22.491 region:rollup2
FOR THE FUTURE. ON SOME OF THE

01:24:20.856 --> 01:24:24.626 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT I WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS

01:24:22.491 --> 01:24:25.994 region:rollup2
ON. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE

01:24:24.626 --> 01:24:27.629 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL I

01:24:25.994 --> 01:24:28.830 region:rollup2
WOULD SHARE WITH YOU THAT LAST

01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:30.666 region:rollup2
YEAR WE SPENT ABOUT THREE POINT

01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:32.067 region:rollup2
FIVE MILLION AND IT YIELDED

01:24:30.666 --> 01:24:33.435 region:rollup2
ABOUT EIGHTEEN MILLION AND

01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:34.736 region:rollup2
REVENUE.

01:24:33.435 --> 01:24:36.138 region:rollup2
SO WE THINK THAT IT'S BEEN VERY

01:24:34.736 --> 01:24:38.040 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL BUT WITH THIS

01:24:36.138 --> 01:24:40.242 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL WOULD DO WAS PROVIDE US

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:41.476 region:rollup2
A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBILITY AND

01:24:40.242 --> 01:24:42.778 region:rollup2
HOW TO USE THE FUNDS UNDER THE

01:24:41.476 --> 01:24:44.846 region:rollup2
CURRENT CONSTRUCT.

01:24:42.778 --> 01:24:46.214 region:rollup2
WE ARE SOMEWHAT LIMITED THAT

01:24:44.846 --> 01:24:47.482 region:rollup2
ONE WE EARN REVENUE THROUGH THIS

01:24:46.214 --> 01:24:50.352 region:rollup2
PROGRAM A PORTION OF THAT

01:24:47.482 --> 01:24:52.321 region:rollup2
REVENUE MUST REMAIN IN THIS POT

01:24:50.352 --> 01:24:53.855 region:rollup2
OF MONEY THAT JUST GETS PLOWED

01:24:52.321 --> 01:25:00.262 region:rollup2
ON BACK INTO REVENUE GENERATION

01:24:53.855 --> 01:25:01.330 region:rollup2
RATHER FOR THE ORGANIZATION.

01:25:00.262 --> 01:25:02.831 region:rollup2
SO THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO BE

01:25:01.330 --> 01:25:04.333 region:rollup2
MORE EFFICIENT AND I THINK GET

01:25:02.831 --> 01:25:06.401 region:rollup2
BACK TO THE ORIGINAL INTENTION

01:25:04.333 --> 01:25:07.736 region:rollup2
OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT THIS

01:25:06.401 --> 01:25:09.638 region:rollup2
THIS ON BE ALLOWED TO BE

01:25:07.736 --> 01:25:10.105 region:rollup2
INVESTED. TO ENHANCE VISITOR

01:25:09.638 --> 01:25:12.274 region:rollup2

PERMANENT.

01:25:12.274 --> 01:25:15.711 region:rollup2
ABOUT FIVE OF OUR EXISTING

01:25:14.810 --> 01:25:17.346 region:rollup2

STAY. AT VARIOUS PARTS OF THOSE

01:25:35.797 --> 01:25:38.867 region:rollup2
THAT'S KIND OF THE COMPLEMENT OF

01:25:37.432 --> 01:25:41.303 region:rollup2
THE REVENUE PER NOT PROJECT THAT

01:25:38.867 --> 01:25:41.703 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IT ALSO

01:25:41.303 --> 01:25:43.972 region:rollup2
WOULD ESTABLISH.

01:25:41.703 --> 01:25:45.841 region:rollup2
A POT OF MONEY THAT IS

01:25:43.972 --> 01:25:47.309 region:rollup2
DEDICATED TO SEASONAL WORKERS

01:25:45.841 --> 01:25:49.645 region:rollup2
WE'VE DETERMINED THAT ONE OF THE

01:25:47.309 --> 01:25:50.712 region:rollup2
MOST IMMEDIATE WAYS THAT WE CAN

01:25:49.645 --> 01:25:52.848 region:rollup2

INTO THE SYSTEM. AND WE HAVE

01:26:00.422 --> 01:26:02.991 region:rollup2
ANNUALLY BEEN USING THIS FOUR

01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:05.060 region:rollup2
POINT THREE FOUR MILLION FOR

01:26:02.991 --> 01:26:06.561 region:rollup2
THAT PURPOSE I'M CURRENTLY

A ENFORCEMENT BACKLOG OF TWO

01:53:09.216 --> 01:53:13.620 region:rollup2
HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT OPEN CASES

01:53:11.485 --> 01:53:15.222 region:rollup2
WITH THREE INDIVIDUALS BEING

01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:16.590 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM IN OUR

01:53:15.222 --> 01:53:18.392 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM.

01:53:16.590 --> 01:53:19.726 region:rollup2
ONLY TWENTY THREE OF THOSE TWO

01:53:18.392 --> 01:53:21.662 region:rollup2
HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT OPEN CASES

01:53:19.726 --> 01:53:22.729 region:rollup2
ARE ACTUALLY ACTIVE

01:53:21.662 --> 01:53:24.364 region:rollup2
BECAUSE CANDIDLY ENFORCEMENT

01:53:22.729 --> 01:53:25.832 region:rollup2
TAKES AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME AND

01:53:24.364 --> 01:53:27.000 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU HAVE ONLY THREE PEOPLE.

01:53:25.832 --> 01:53:28.602 region:rollup2
IT TAKES OF THE TREMENDOUS

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.936 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF RESOURCES

01:53:28.602 --> 01:53:30.737 region:rollup2
THAT BACKLOG HAS ACTUALLY

01:53:29.936 --> 01:53:32.406 region:rollup2
INCREASED BY MORE THAN FIFTY

01:53:30.737 --> 01:53:35.208 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:53:32.406 --> 01:53:37.411 region:rollup2
DURING THE PAST TEN YEARS.

01:53:35.208 --> 01:53:39.579 region:rollup2
WHEN I JOIN BE CDC IS ACTIVE

01:53:37.411 --> 01:53:41.181 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE.

01:53:39.579 --> 01:53:42.683 region:rollup2
.

01:53:41.181 --> 01:53:44.918 region:rollup2
I DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS NO

01:53:42.683 --> 01:53:46.953 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO STATION OF CASES.

01:53:44.918 --> 01:53:48.188 region:rollup2
THAT BC DC HAD SPENT THE

01:53:46.953 --> 01:53:50.424 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS DECADE ESSENTIALLY

01:53:48.188 --> 01:53:53.060 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT MUCH SMALLER CASES

01:53:50.424 --> 01:53:53.894 region:rollup2
WITH THIS MUCH SMALLER FINES AND

01:53:53.060 --> 01:53:55.462 region:rollup2
THERE WAS VERY VERY LITTLE

01:53:53.894 --> 01:53:56.797 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION BY THE

01:53:55.462 --> 01:53:58.532 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONERS ON ENFORCEMENT

01:53:56.797 --> 01:54:00.333 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE. TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE

01:53:58.532 --> 01:54:01.268 region:rollup2
DIRECTION AND GUIDANCE AS WELL

01:54:00.333 --> 01:54:02.602 region:rollup2
AS.

01:54:01.268 --> 01:54:04.137 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT LARGER TYPES OF

01:54:02.602 --> 01:54:07.574 region:rollup2
CASES.

01:54:04.137 --> 01:54:09.076 region:rollup2
SINCE THEN OF AS PART OF OUR

01:54:07.574 --> 01:54:11.812 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN STRATEGIC

01:54:09.076 --> 01:54:14.147 region:rollup2
PLAN WE HAVE DEVELOPED A MUCH

01:54:11.812 --> 01:54:16.616 region:rollup2
MORE DATA DRIVEN. ENFORCEMENT

01:54:14.147 --> 01:54:18.018 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WHICH CONCENTRATES ON

01:54:16.616 --> 01:54:20.620 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DEVELOPING A POINT

01:54:18.018 --> 01:54:23.323 region:rollup2
SYSTEM A TO TAKE A LOOK AT HARM

01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:25.192 region:rollup2
TO THE BAY. HARM TO ACCESS TO

01:54:23.323 --> 01:54:26.493 region:rollup2
THE BAY AS WELL AS TO THE SYSOON

01:54:25.192 --> 01:54:29.129 region:rollup2
MARSH.

01:54:26.493 --> 01:54:31.264 region:rollup2
AND THEREFORE WE HAVE MOVED TO

01:54:29.129 --> 01:54:32.666 region:rollup2
LARGER SCALE CASES WITH

01:54:31.264 --> 01:54:34.401 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE POTENTIAL.

01:54:32.666 --> 01:54:36.269 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THOSE LARGER CASES

01:54:34.401 --> 01:54:38.905 region:rollup2
SIMPLY CAUSE MORE HARM TO THE

01:54:36.269 --> 01:54:40.841 region:rollup2
BAY OR DENY MORE OF THE PUBLIC

01:54:38.905 --> 01:54:42.609 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO THE BAY.

01:54:40.841 --> 01:54:44.211 region:rollup2
AND AS A RESULT WHAT WE HAVE

01:54:42.609 --> 01:54:46.446 region:rollup2
DONE IS INCREASE OUR

01:54:44.211 --> 01:54:48.048 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZATION ACTUALLY DEVELOP

01:54:46.446 --> 01:54:50.250 region:rollup2
A STRATEGY WITH REGARD HOW TO DO

01:54:48.048 --> 01:54:52.486 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT. AND DO SO WITH

01:54:50.250 --> 01:54:53.887 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE FROM OUR COMMISSIONERS

01:54:52.486 --> 01:54:55.822 region:rollup2
LET ME SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE

01:54:53.887 --> 01:54:57.557 region:rollup2
BC DC COMMISSIONERS.

01:54:55.822 --> 01:54:59.926 region:rollup2
THEY NINE OF THEM ARE COUNTY

01:54:57.557 --> 01:55:01.228 region:rollup2
SUPERVISORS FOR OUR LOCAL

01:54:59.926 --> 01:55:03.330 region:rollup2
ELECTED OFFICIALS FROM CITY

01:55:01.228 --> 01:55:04.331 region:rollup2
COUNCIL AND OUT OF THE FIVE

01:55:03.330 --> 01:55:06.733 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THE ENFORCEMENT

01:55:04.331 --> 01:55:08.368 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE IT BC DC THREE ARE

01:55:06.733 --> 01:55:10.470 region:rollup2
THOSE LOCALLY ELECTED OFFICIALS

01:55:08.368 --> 01:55:12.973 region:rollup2
FROM AROUND THE BAY. THEY HANDLE

01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:15.008 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT CASES ALL THE TIME

01:55:12.973 --> 01:55:16.209 region:rollup2
AS PART OF THEIR DAY JOB AS IT

01:55:15.008 --> 01:55:18.078 region:rollup2
WERE THEY UNDERSTAND HOW

01:55:16.209 --> 01:55:19.546 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT WORKS WITH REGARD TO

01:55:18.078 --> 01:55:21.281 region:rollup2
PLANNING IN PERMITS.

01:55:19.546 --> 01:55:24.584 region:rollup2
AND THEY HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY

01:55:21.281 --> 01:55:25.919 region:rollup2
WONDERFUL IN DIRECTING AND. AND

01:55:24.584 --> 01:55:27.921 region:rollup2
PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO THE

01:55:25.919 --> 01:55:29.689 region:rollup2
STAFF AS WE TAKE A LOOK AND

01:55:27.921 --> 01:55:31.391 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN PRIORITIZE

01:55:29.689 --> 01:55:33.360 region:rollup2
AND HOW WE CAN MOVE ON.

01:55:31.391 --> 01:55:34.528 region:rollup2
WE HAVE RECEIVED TREMENDOUS

01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:35.896 region:rollup2
SUPPORT FROM THE ATTORNEY

01:55:34.528 --> 01:55:37.664 region:rollup2
GENERAL'S OFFICE FOR WHICH WE

01:55:35.896 --> 01:55:39.199 region:rollup2
ARE TREMENDOUSLY GRATEFUL AND

01:55:37.664 --> 01:55:41.067 region:rollup2
WE'RE USING TOOLS WHICH YOU THE

01:55:39.199 --> 01:55:42.636 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE PROVIDED US ABOUT

01:55:41.067 --> 01:55:44.571 region:rollup2
TEN YEARS AGO WHICH WE DID NOT

01:55:42.636 --> 01:55:46.106 region:rollup2
HAVE BEFORE. WITH REGARD TO HOW

01:55:44.571 --> 01:55:47.707 region:rollup2
WE CAN ACTUALLY DO OUR

01:55:46.106 --> 01:55:49.309 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT WORK.

01:55:47.707 --> 01:55:51.077 region:rollup2
THE KEY HERE AND THIS IS WHERE

01:55:49.309 --> 01:55:52.779 region:rollup2
ALL PROBABLY END BECAUSE I'M

01:55:51.077 --> 01:55:53.513 region:rollup2
SURE YOU HAVE QUESTIONS AND AND

01:55:52.779 --> 01:55:54.981 region:rollup2
WILL ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT THE

01:55:53.513 --> 01:55:57.117 region:rollup2
FUNDING MECHANISM.

01:55:54.981 --> 01:56:00.220 region:rollup2
IS THAT THE CDC DOESN'T WANNA BE

01:55:57.117 --> 01:56:01.855 region:rollup2
THE COP BEHIND THE BILLBOARD IN

01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:03.590 region:rollup2
THE RURAL HIGHWAY WHO TRIES TO

01:56:01.855 --> 01:56:04.858 region:rollup2
CATCH PEOPLE GOING SEVENTY MILES

01:56:03.590 --> 01:56:06.226 region:rollup2
AN HOUR IN A SIXTY FIVE MILE PER

01:56:04.858 --> 01:56:07.694 region:rollup2
HOUR ZONE.

01:56:06.226 --> 01:56:09.663 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TAKE

01:56:07.694 --> 01:56:12.365 region:rollup2
A LOOK AT THE LARGE SCALE

01:56:09.663 --> 01:56:14.334 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES ALONG IT

01:56:12.365 --> 01:56:16.169 region:rollup2
INSIDE THE BAY? AND WORK

01:56:14.334 --> 01:56:17.637 region:rollup2
COOPERATIVELY WITH THOSE PERMIT

01:56:16.169 --> 01:56:19.673 region:rollup2
HOLDERS

01:56:17.637 --> 01:56:21.641 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THE THING THAT BC DC

01:56:19.673 --> 01:56:23.510 region:rollup2
HAS HISTORICALLY DONE WE DON'T

01:56:21.641 --> 01:56:24.911 region:rollup2
START A PROCESS BY SENDING A

01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:26.746 region:rollup2
LETTER AND SAYING.

01:56:24.911 --> 01:56:28.381 region:rollup2
NOW THAT'S THE PROBLEM INSTEAD

01:56:26.746 --> 01:56:30.016 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SITE VISITS WE WORK

01:56:28.381 --> 01:56:31.518 region:rollup2
PERMIT HOLDERS WHETHER THEY BE

01:56:30.016 --> 01:56:33.520 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AGENCIES ARE PRIVATE

01:56:31.518 --> 01:56:35.222 region:rollup2
PRIVATE DEVELOPERS AND WE TRIED

01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:36.623 region:rollup2
TO GET AGREEMENTS BECAUSE

01:56:35.222 --> 01:56:39.025 region:rollup2
CANDIDLY GETTING AN AGREEMENT IS

01:56:36.623 --> 01:56:41.628 region:rollup2
AN AWFUL LOT QUICKER. AN AWFUL

01:56:39.025 --> 01:56:43.196 region:rollup2
LOT MORE SATISFYING AND CANDIDLY

01:56:41.628 --> 01:56:44.698 region:rollup2
SOLVES THE PROBLEM A WHOLE LOT

01:56:43.196 --> 01:56:46.299 region:rollup2
EARLIER THAN HAVING TO GO

01:56:44.698 --> 01:56:47.634 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE TO GAUGE SO THAT'S

01:56:46.299 --> 01:56:49.803 region:rollup2
WHAT WE TRY TO DO.

01:56:47.634 --> 01:56:51.872 region:rollup2
THE THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU IS HOW

01:56:49.803 --> 01:56:53.740 region:rollup2
BC DC CAN EXPAND THAT

01:56:51.872 --> 01:56:56.142 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM.

01:56:53.740 --> 01:56:58.011 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE WOULD NEED AT BC DC

01:56:56.142 --> 01:57:00.146 region:rollup2
IS A FULL TIME ATTORNEY WHO

01:56:58.011 --> 01:57:02.349 region:rollup2
HANDLES ENFORCEMENT. INSTEAD OF

01:57:00.146 --> 01:57:03.650 region:rollup2
OUR CHIEF COUNSEL WHO SPENDING

01:57:02.349 --> 01:57:04.918 region:rollup2
EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF HIS TIME

01:57:03.650 --> 01:57:06.720 region:rollup2
ON ENFORCEMENT AND FIFTEEN

01:57:04.918 --> 01:57:07.287 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF HIS TIME ON THE OTHER

01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:08.421 region:rollup2
STUFF THAT I WANTED TO SPEND

01:57:07.287 --> 01:57:09.956 region:rollup2
TIME.

01:57:08.421 --> 01:57:11.825 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS A SENIOR LEVEL

01:57:09.956 --> 01:57:13.460 region:rollup2
MANAGER WHO CAN MANAGE THOSE

01:57:11.825 --> 01:57:14.861 region:rollup2
THREE PEOPLE INSURE THAT THE

01:57:13.460 --> 01:57:16.696 region:rollup2
DIRECTION IS BEING FOLLOWED IT

01:57:14.861 --> 01:57:18.765 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HELPED DEVISE THAT

01:57:16.696 --> 01:57:21.268 region:rollup2
STRATEGY. AND ALSO HELPED DEVISE

01:57:18.765 --> 01:57:23.036 region:rollup2
A TRUE COMPLIANCE PROGRAM.

01:57:21.268 --> 01:57:25.205 region:rollup2
SO THE ISSUE YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU

01:57:23.036 --> 01:57:26.840 region:rollup2
AS IS THE REQUEST BY P. CDC TO

01:57:25.205 --> 01:57:29.442 region:rollup2
ALLOW US TO USE FUNDS FROM THE

01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:31.411 region:rollup2
BAY FILL. AND ABATEMENT FUND

01:57:29.442 --> 01:57:32.846 region:rollup2
INTO WHICH FINDS ARE ACTUALLY

01:57:31.411 --> 01:57:35.015 region:rollup2
DEPOSITED.

01:57:32.846 --> 01:57:37.117 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE A STABLE SOURCE FOR

01:57:35.015 --> 01:57:38.985 region:rollup2
AT LEAST THREE TO FIVE YEARS FOR

01:57:37.117 --> 01:57:39.586 region:rollup2
THOSE TWO POSITIONS

01:57:38.985 --> 01:57:42.322 region:rollup2
AND OUR ESTIMATES ARE THAT IF

01:57:39.586 --> 01:57:44.925 region:rollup2
WE.

01:57:42.322 --> 01:57:46.726 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO HAVE LARGE

01:57:44.925 --> 01:57:48.929 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT CASES WHICH ARE.

01:57:46.726 --> 01:57:50.931 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY NEGOTIATED SOLUTIONS

01:57:48.929 --> 01:57:52.866 region:rollup2
AND SETTLEMENTS THOSE FUNDS WILL

01:57:50.931 --> 01:57:55.335 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY PAID BACK THE FUND

01:57:52.866 --> 01:57:57.370 region:rollup2
ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND AND WE

01:57:55.335 --> 01:57:59.439 region:rollup2
WILL TIE THOSE TWO POSITIONS

01:57:57.370 --> 01:58:01.274 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY TO THOSE FUNDS.

01:57:59.439 --> 01:58:02.609 region:rollup2
SO THAT WHEN THOSE FUNDS IF

01:58:01.274 --> 01:58:04.744 region:rollup2
THOSE FUNDS AND IF THAT FUND

01:58:02.609 --> 01:58:05.378 region:rollup2
DOESN'T IS NO LONGER SOLVENT WE

01:58:04.744 --> 01:58:06.980 region:rollup2
SIMPLY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO FUND

01:58:05.378 --> 01:58:07.981 region:rollup2
THOSE TO.

01:58:06.980 --> 01:58:10.283 region:rollup2
SO WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO ASK

01:58:07.981 --> 01:58:11.418 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ABOUT.

01:58:10.283 --> 01:58:13.353 region:rollup2
I THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:58:11.418 --> 01:58:15.322 region:rollup2
UP.

01:58:13.353 --> 01:58:16.389 region:rollup2
SIMILAR.

01:58:15.322 --> 01:58:17.724 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER MISTER RIGHT

01:58:16.389 --> 01:58:19.059 region:rollup2
CHAIRED THANK YOU DIRECTOR FOR

01:58:17.724 --> 01:58:20.961 region:rollup2
THE PRESENTATION I GUESS I HAVE

01:58:19.059 --> 01:58:21.494 region:rollup2
TO TAKE OUT THE COP BEHIND THE

01:58:20.961 --> 01:58:22.696 region:rollup2
BILLBOARD REFERENCE IN MY

01:58:21.494 --> 01:58:24.497 region:rollup2
TALKING.

01:58:22.696 --> 01:58:26.733 region:rollup2
HERE SINCE YOU'VE ACTUALLY.

01:58:24.497 --> 01:58:30.537 region:rollup2
ACTIVELY ADDRESS THAT CONCERN

01:58:26.733 --> 01:58:32.105 region:rollup2
BUT I AM A BIG FAN OF THE CDC AS

01:58:30.537 --> 01:58:34.674 region:rollup2
A BAY AREA NATIVE. HAVING GROWN

01:58:32.105 --> 01:58:36.676 region:rollup2
UP THERE THE BAY WOULD NOT BE

01:58:34.674 --> 01:58:38.345 region:rollup2
WHAT IT IS TODAY WITHOUT THE

01:58:36.676 --> 01:58:39.613 region:rollup2
FINAL WORK AT THE CDC IN THE

01:58:38.345 --> 01:58:41.214 region:rollup2
STEWARDSHIP.

01:58:39.613 --> 01:58:41.781 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE ORGANIZATION I KNOW

01:58:41.214 --> 01:58:43.049 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA BE HOLDING THIS

01:58:41.781 --> 01:58:45.652 region:rollup2
ITEM.

01:58:43.049 --> 01:58:47.120 region:rollup2
OPEN BECAUSE I JUST HAVE SOME

01:58:45.652 --> 01:58:47.687 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE

01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:49.122 region:rollup2
MECHANISM HERE AND MAYBE WE

01:58:47.687 --> 01:58:50.890 region:rollup2
WRITER.

01:58:49.122 --> 01:58:54.260 region:rollup2
TALK OUR WAY THROUGH THAT SO.

01:58:50.890 --> 01:58:55.862 region:rollup2
I WANT BE CDC TO CONTINUE ITS

01:58:54.260 --> 01:58:57.797 region:rollup2
ITS CRITICAL MISSION OF OF

01:58:55.862 --> 01:58:58.932 region:rollup2
REGULATION AND OVERSIGHT THE

01:58:57.797 --> 01:59:00.367 region:rollup2
BUDGET REQUEST THOUGH.

01:58:58.932 --> 01:59:02.369 region:rollup2
I THINK PUTS US ON OUR ON THE

01:59:00.367 --> 01:59:02.669 region:rollup2
WRONG PATH AND I CAN BE SWAYED

01:59:02.369 --> 01:59:03.970 region:rollup2
ON THIS BUT.

01:59:02.669 --> 01:59:04.838 region:rollup2
.

01:59:03.970 --> 01:59:06.439 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME FUNDAMENTAL

01:59:04.838 --> 01:59:08.174 region:rollup2
CONCERNS I HAVE THAT WERE ASKED

01:59:06.439 --> 01:59:10.677 region:rollup2
TO APPROVE MORE STAFF FOR

01:59:08.174 --> 01:59:12.312 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT. USING ENFORCEMENT

01:59:10.677 --> 01:59:13.813 region:rollup2
PROCEEDS RIGHT SO.

01:59:12.312 --> 01:59:16.082 region:rollup2
I NEED TO GET TO A COMFORT

01:59:13.813 --> 01:59:18.918 region:rollup2
LEVEL WITH THAT AND I'M I'M NOT.

01:59:16.082 --> 01:59:20.487 region:rollup2
THERE RIGHT NOW SO I THINK IT

01:59:18.918 --> 01:59:22.122 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZE IS MORE AGGRESSIVE

01:59:20.487 --> 01:59:23.890 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE

01:59:22.122 --> 01:59:26.026 region:rollup2
OF REPLENISHING OUR COFFERS A I

01:59:23.890 --> 01:59:26.826 region:rollup2
THINK WE COULD SOMEHOW CRAFT A

01:59:26.026 --> 01:59:28.795 region:rollup2
BETTER WAY TO DO THIS SO.

01:59:26.826 --> 01:59:30.096 region:rollup2
.

01:59:28.795 --> 01:59:32.298 region:rollup2
THAT REQUEST COMES WITHIN THE

01:59:30.096 --> 01:59:33.600 region:rollup2
CONTEXT OF A COUPLE OF YEARS A

01:59:32.298 --> 01:59:34.868 region:rollup2
PRETTY VISIBLE ENFORCEMENT

01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:36.669 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY AND FROM WHAT I CAN

01:59:34.868 --> 01:59:37.604 region:rollup2
GATHER.

01:59:36.669 --> 01:59:38.972 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT WAS IN A SURLY

01:59:37.604 --> 01:59:40.673 region:rollup2
PRIORITY UNDER THE PREVIOUS

01:59:38.972 --> 01:59:42.809 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR NOW IT SEEMS TO BE

01:59:40.673 --> 01:59:44.778 region:rollup2
RAMPING UP I THINK SOME LONG

01:59:42.809 --> 01:59:46.279 region:rollup2
TIME STAKEHOLDERS.

01:59:44.778 --> 01:59:48.515 region:rollup2
AROUND THE BAY FRONT.

01:59:46.279 --> 01:59:49.983 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN SHOCKED A LITTLE BIT

01:59:48.515 --> 01:59:51.484 region:rollup2
AT THE NEW.

01:59:49.983 --> 01:59:53.286 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT REGIME.

01:59:51.484 --> 01:59:54.320 region:rollup2
I THERE A COUPLE OF ISSUES I

01:59:53.286 --> 01:59:55.655 region:rollup2
THINK BETTER ARE SORT OF IN THE

01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:57.424 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF BEING MEDIATED BEING

01:59:55.655 --> 01:59:57.924 region:rollup2
WORKED THROUGH SO. I'M NOT GOING

01:59:57.424 --> 02:00:00.060 region:rollup2
TO BE.

01:59:57.924 --> 02:00:01.728 region:rollup2
COMMENTING ON ANYTHING SPECIFIC

02:00:00.060 --> 02:00:03.096 region:rollup2
IN THAT REGARD IT'S REALLY ABOUT

02:00:01.728 --> 02:00:04.264 region:rollup2
THE GAME PLAN GOING FORWARD NOW

02:00:03.096 --> 02:00:06.366 region:rollup2
I LIKE THAT YOU ARE.

02:00:04.264 --> 02:00:07.300 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZING.

02:00:06.366 --> 02:00:09.469 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S SOME ADDITIONAL

02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:10.937 region:rollup2
THOUGHT GOING INTO THIS.

02:00:09.469 --> 02:00:12.572 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW I'M A PRETTY.

02:00:10.937 --> 02:00:14.207 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL GUY I'VE PRETTY A

02:00:12.572 --> 02:00:15.208 region:rollup2
VOTING RECORD IN THAT REGARD BUT

02:00:14.207 --> 02:00:18.845 region:rollup2
I'M CONCERNED THAT.

02:00:15.208 --> 02:00:19.879 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IF IT FEELS ARBITRARY.

02:00:18.845 --> 02:00:21.414 region:rollup2
IN ANY WAY.

02:00:19.879 --> 02:00:22.515 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE'RE GIVING

02:00:21.414 --> 02:00:23.216 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT A BAD NAME IN THE BAY

02:00:22.515 --> 02:00:24.417 region:rollup2
AREA.

02:00:23.216 --> 02:00:25.585 region:rollup2
AND HAVE FOR BE WE DON'T WANT

02:00:24.417 --> 02:00:27.053 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT RIGHT THAT I'M

02:00:25.585 --> 02:00:28.655 region:rollup2
CONCERNED THAT THIS IS HOW FUNDS

02:00:27.053 --> 02:00:30.256 region:rollup2
ARE INTERACTING WITH THEIR

02:00:28.655 --> 02:00:32.926 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.

02:00:30.256 --> 02:00:34.327 region:rollup2
AND I'VE HEARD SOME TROUBLING

02:00:32.926 --> 02:00:37.330 region:rollup2
STORIES SO.

02:00:34.327 --> 02:00:40.266 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY ON THE

02:00:37.330 --> 02:00:41.167 region:rollup2
RIGHT. GENERAL PATH HERE.

02:00:40.266 --> 02:00:43.269 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE GOING TO ESTABLISH

02:00:41.167 --> 02:00:45.739 region:rollup2
SOME CONSISTENCY GOING FORWARD

02:00:43.269 --> 02:00:47.440 region:rollup2
THAT. ON THE STAKEHOLDERS CAN

02:00:45.739 --> 02:00:49.309 region:rollup2
SORT OF COUNT ON LIKE OF IT THIS

02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:52.011 region:rollup2
IS HOW BE CDC OPERATES.

02:00:49.309 --> 02:00:52.745 region:rollup2
BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT.

02:00:52.011 --> 02:00:55.115 region:rollup2
THIS TO BE.

02:00:52.745 --> 02:00:57.350 region:rollup2
AYE HEAVY HANDED KIND OF A SET

02:00:55.115 --> 02:00:59.252 region:rollup2
UP WHERE YOU GOT IT FORSMAN

02:00:57.350 --> 02:01:01.588 region:rollup2
BEING DONE REALLY TO KEEP.

02:00:59.252 --> 02:01:03.623 region:rollup2
STAFFING THESE POSITIONS GOING

02:01:01.588 --> 02:01:06.025 region:rollup2
FORWARD THERE ARE SO MANY ISSUES

02:01:03.623 --> 02:01:08.328 region:rollup2
GOING FOR WITH BAY LEVEL RISE.

02:01:06.025 --> 02:01:10.630 region:rollup2
YOU FOLKS ARE GONNA HAVE. YOUR

02:01:08.328 --> 02:01:12.665 region:rollup2
HANDS FULL AS WE ALL DEAL.

02:01:10.630 --> 02:01:14.868 region:rollup2
WITH A GRAPPLING WITH THE

02:01:12.665 --> 02:01:16.035 region:rollup2
CHANGING BAY LINE I IN THE BAY

02:01:14.868 --> 02:01:19.506 region:rollup2
AREA SAID THEY'RE GOING TO BE

02:01:16.035 --> 02:01:20.373 region:rollup2
SOME OTHER LARGER PRIORITIES.

02:01:19.506 --> 02:01:22.242 region:rollup2
AND AND BC HE SEES ROLE REALLY

02:01:20.373 --> 02:01:22.842 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO BEOME EVEN MORE

02:01:22.242 --> 02:01:23.643 region:rollup2
CRITICAL THAT HAS BEEN IN THE

02:01:22.842 --> 02:01:25.111 region:rollup2
PAST.

02:01:23.643 --> 02:01:26.780 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T WANT TO GET OFF TRACK

02:01:25.111 --> 02:01:27.981 region:rollup2
IN THIS REGARD ON I JUST NEED TO

02:01:26.780 --> 02:01:29.282 region:rollup2
GET TO A BETTER COMFORT LEVEL

02:01:27.981 --> 02:01:31.317 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW THE AGENCY IS AB

02:01:29.282 --> 02:01:33.353 region:rollup2
APPROACHING. ENFORCEMENT AND

02:01:31.317 --> 02:01:35.288 region:rollup2
REALLY WHAT THE BUDGET MECHANISM

02:01:33.353 --> 02:01:36.856 region:rollup2
IT IS IN THAT REGARD SO.

02:01:35.288 --> 02:01:38.391 region:rollup2
THERE SYNC ACCOUNT RECESSION

02:01:36.856 --> 02:01:39.893 region:rollup2
WILL BE HAVING MY DISTRICT ALONG

02:01:38.391 --> 02:01:41.261 region:rollup2
WITH SENATOR HEALTH. AND NOW

02:01:39.893 --> 02:01:42.095 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE OTHER KEY PLAYERS

02:01:41.261 --> 02:01:44.397 region:rollup2
THERE SAY LOOK FOR THAT

02:01:42.095 --> 02:01:45.899 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AND I THE COURT TO.

02:01:44.397 --> 02:01:47.667 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THE AGENCY TO SEE

02:01:45.899 --> 02:01:50.003 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S MAYBE A BETTER WAY TO

02:01:47.667 --> 02:01:50.603 region:rollup2
APPROACH THIS.

02:01:50.003 --> 02:01:52.405 region:rollup2
I THINK A SMALL DITCH DID YOU

02:01:50.603 --> 02:01:53.239 region:rollup2
WATER.

02:01:52.405 --> 02:01:55.008 region:rollup2
SPARTAN ANYWAY.

02:01:53.239 --> 02:01:55.708 region:rollup2
YEAH I I LEFT LIMIT RESPONSE

02:01:55.008 --> 02:01:57.710 region:rollup2
SAYING I.

02:01:55.708 --> 02:01:59.579 region:rollup2
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND AND TOTALLY

02:01:57.710 --> 02:02:00.079 region:rollup2
SUPPORT.

02:01:59.579 --> 02:02:01.481 region:rollup2
SAYING ESPECIALLY ABOUT

02:02:00.079 --> 02:02:03.249 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT.

02:02:01.481 --> 02:02:05.451 region:rollup2
I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

02:02:03.249 --> 02:02:06.486 region:rollup2
THAT A REGULATORY AGENCY CAN DO

02:02:05.451 --> 02:02:08.888 region:rollup2
FOR THE PUBLIC IS DEMONSTRATE

02:02:06.486 --> 02:02:10.990 region:rollup2
CONSIST.

02:02:08.888 --> 02:02:12.392 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT ACTUALLY.

02:02:10.990 --> 02:02:13.993 region:rollup2
TELLS THE PUBLIC THAT THE

02:02:12.392 --> 02:02:15.228 region:rollup2
EVERITT REGULATORY AGENCY

02:02:13.993 --> 02:02:16.663 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDS WHAT'S GOING ON OUT

02:02:15.228 --> 02:02:18.631 region:rollup2
THERE.

02:02:16.663 --> 02:02:21.768 region:rollup2
AN ACTUALLY HAS A PLAN TO DEAL

02:02:18.631 --> 02:02:23.503 region:rollup2
WITH AND MAP PLAN CAN BE COUNTED

02:02:21.768 --> 02:02:25.338 region:rollup2
ON IN FUTURE YEARS.

02:02:23.503 --> 02:02:26.973 region:rollup2
AND. CANDIDLY WE HAVEN'T BEEN

02:02:25.338 --> 02:02:27.674 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT AT THE

02:02:26.973 --> 02:02:29.242 region:rollup2
SEE WITH REGARD TO HOW WE

02:02:27.674 --> 02:02:31.277 region:rollup2
ENFORCE

02:02:29.242 --> 02:02:32.478 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT'S FOR AN AWFUL LOT

02:02:31.277 --> 02:02:34.480 region:rollup2
OF REASONS SO WE ARE MOVING

02:02:32.478 --> 02:02:35.548 region:rollup2
TOWARD CONSISTENT.

02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:37.517 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

02:02:35.548 --> 02:02:38.751 region:rollup2
HAPPENS WHEN YOU MOVE TOWARD A

02:02:37.517 --> 02:02:40.620 region:rollup2
NEW KIND OF PROGRAMMER

02:02:38.751 --> 02:02:41.688 region:rollup2
REINVIGORATE A PROGRAM IS THAT

02:02:40.620 --> 02:02:43.056 region:rollup2
YOU UPSET THE EXISTING APPLE

02:02:41.688 --> 02:02:44.123 region:rollup2
CART.

02:02:43.056 --> 02:02:45.558 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE TALKING

02:02:44.123 --> 02:02:47.293 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHICH IS THAT WHICH IS

02:02:45.558 --> 02:02:47.860 region:rollup2
THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN BC DC IS

02:02:47.293 --> 02:02:49.829 region:rollup2
SEEN AS.

02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:51.164 region:rollup2
THERE ACTUALLY BEING SERIOUS

02:02:49.829 --> 02:02:53.766 region:rollup2
ABOUT ENFORCEMENT ON A LARGE

02:02:51.164 --> 02:02:56.069 region:rollup2
SCALE SO GETTING TO THAT POINT

02:02:53.766 --> 02:02:57.103 region:rollup2
OF CONSISTENCY IS NOT EASY.

02:02:56.069 --> 02:03:00.206 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS

02:02:57.103 --> 02:03:01.307 region:rollup2
WHY WE HAVE A PRIORITIZATION.

02:03:00.206 --> 02:03:02.842 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS

02:03:01.307 --> 02:03:04.911 region:rollup2
WHY YOU HAVE TO ALSO INTEGRATE

02:03:02.842 --> 02:03:07.080 region:rollup2
THAT PRIORITIZATION SYSTEM WITH

02:03:04.911 --> 02:03:08.615 region:rollup2
THOSE CASES WITH THE CASES

02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:10.083 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ALREADY WORKING ON.

02:03:08.615 --> 02:03:11.684 region:rollup2
AND YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

02:03:10.083 --> 02:03:13.519 region:rollup2
TO MERGE THAT TOGETHER AND

02:03:11.684 --> 02:03:16.022 region:rollup2
INTEGRATE IT SO THAT IN THE NEXT

02:03:13.519 --> 02:03:18.691 region:rollup2
THREE TO FIVE YEARS WHAT BC DC

02:03:16.022 --> 02:03:19.559 region:rollup2
IS DOING BECOMES EXPECTED.

02:03:18.691 --> 02:03:21.728 region:rollup2
AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

02:03:19.559 --> 02:03:22.896 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT ABOUT BECOMING

02:03:21.728 --> 02:03:25.231 region:rollup2
EXPECTED TO A SENSE OF

02:03:22.896 --> 02:03:27.433 region:rollup2
CONSISTENCY IS THAT PROBABLY

02:03:25.231 --> 02:03:29.469 region:rollup2
DOES MORE TO ENCOURAGE

02:03:27.433 --> 02:03:31.471 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE WITH PERMITS.

02:03:29.469 --> 02:03:33.640 region:rollup2
THAN ANYTHING ELSE

02:03:31.471 --> 02:03:35.275 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF THE PUBLIC SECTOR

02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:37.410 region:rollup2
PERMIT HOLDERS IN THE PRIVATE

02:03:35.275 --> 02:03:39.345 region:rollup2
SECTOR PERMIT HOLDERS RECOGNIZE

02:03:37.410 --> 02:03:40.947 region:rollup2
AND UNDERSTAND HOW BC DC

02:03:39.345 --> 02:03:42.215 region:rollup2
APPROACHES ENFORCEMENT ON THOSE

02:03:40.947 --> 02:03:43.950 region:rollup2
LARGE SCALE CASES.

02:03:42.215 --> 02:03:46.152 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A REASON TO LOOK AT

02:03:43.950 --> 02:03:47.754 region:rollup2
HOW THEY'RE WORKING TO MAKE SURE

02:03:46.152 --> 02:03:49.289 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN LOOK AT US AND SAY

02:03:47.754 --> 02:03:49.889 region:rollup2
WE ARE DEFINITELY A COMPLIANCE

02:03:49.289 --> 02:03:51.958 region:rollup2
AND WE CAN ACTUALLY SHOW THAT

02:03:49.889 --> 02:03:53.893 region:rollup2
OFF.

02:03:51.958 --> 02:03:54.560 region:rollup2
