A REAL SAFETY TOXIC MATERIAL. IN THE SENATE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEES OF LIKE TO THANK. ALL OF YOU IN ATTENDANCE FOR COMING HERE IN THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE HAVING AS. SOME OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH SOME MORE THAN OTHERS. OVER THE LAST. SEVERAL YEARS. IT'S BECOME APPARENT THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES ACCEPTANCE CONTROL. HAS HAD PROBLEMS SOME FROM SYSTEMATIC. AND SOME OF THEM JUST GENERAL BUT THESE PROBLEMS HAVE RESULTED IN A DISMISSED THE MISMANAGEMENT OF DEPARTMENT STATUTORY MANDATES THE LEGISLATURE LOOK CRITICALLY. AT THESE PROBLEMS AND ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS THEM AND LEGISLATURE HAS CONDUCTED NUMEROUS OVERSIGHT HEARINGS ON THE DEPARTMENT APPROVED BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS CREATED NEW POSITIONS AND SENT LEGISLATION TO THE GOVERNOR AIMED AT CORRECTING THE. COURSE OF THIS BROKE AGENCY AND NOW TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SENATE BILL EIGHTY THREE ESTABLISH THE INDEPENDENT. REVIEW PANEL TO REVIEW AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT THE TSC WITH THE GOAL OF RESOLVING THE OUTSTANDING OPERATIONAL PROBLEMS WITHIN DTS SEE. UP FOR LONG TERM STABILITY LONG TERM ACCOUNTABILITY AND LONG TERM TRANSPARENCY. THIS PEDAL WAS NOT COMPENSATED FOR THEIR WORK AND I'D LIKE TO PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE. FANTASTIC WORK THAT THEY HAVE ACHIEVED OVER TO A TWO YEAR PERIOD NONE THE LESS THEY WORKED DILIGENTLY TO HELP THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE DEPARTMENT. FIND ANSWERS TO FIXING. THE DEPARTMENT'S. AILMENTS. LET ME APPLAUD THE OUR WITNESS IN THE WHOLE PANEL OF DTS SEE FOR THE WONDERFUL WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. YOU'VE CONDUCTED TWENTY FOUR A PUBLIC. MEETINGS YOU'VE PUBLISHED ELEVEN REPORTS AND FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HAVE COME TO. THAT HAVE COME TO US TODAY WE WILL HEAR FROM. HATCHER. KRAKOW. ON THE PANEL'S FINAL REPORT AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HAVE BEFORE WE HAVE THE CHAIR OF THE. AND VIRAL SAFETY TALKS MATERIAL. SEVEN MEMBER QUICKER AS FEW WORDS. YES OUR FIRST OF ALL I DO WANNA THANK. MR GIDEON KRAKOW FOR HIS EXCELLENT WORK AS CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE. AND I WANT TO THANK. RACHEL AND JOSH THE. THE STAFF FOR. JUST TAKING CARE OF US CHAIRS AND. SENDING THIS IN MANY OTHER HEARINGS AND. PROCEDURES SHOP THEY DO A WONDERFUL WONDERFUL JOB. SO. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY ISSUE THAT'S ANY MORE IMPORTANT AND THE STATE THAN ENSURING HAZARDOUS WASTE IS MANAGED PROPERLY. ANDTHAT THE CLEAN UP SITES ARE CLEANED UP IN THE SAFE AND RESPONSIBLE WAY. LATER ON WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SUPERVISE HERE RIGHT HELD ASSEMBLIES HERE. WHO'S EXPERIENCED. MUCH OF THIS WITH HER CONSTITUENTS. ALL MENTIONED. ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. GARCIA'S SANTIAGO. AND OTHERS AND MYSELF LAST YEAR WHO BROUGHT UP BILLS BASED UPON WHAT YOUR COMMITTEE IS DONE. I'LL NOTE THE NUMBER OF THOSE BILLS WERE VETOED BECAUSE THE DICK GOVERNOR FELT THERE WAS ENOUGH FUNDING TO DO THEM. THAT'S CERTAINLY AN ISSUE WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY. SO THERE'S CERTAINLY BEEN A LOT OF OF CONCERNS FROM THE COMMUNITY. ONE CONCERN I SHARE WITH ALL OF THE STAKE HOLDERS. IS WITH VERY DIFFERENT VIEW POINTS RELATED DEPARTMENT'S DECISION MAKING PROCESS. I UNDERSTAND THE ADMINISTRATION'S WORKING DILIGENTLY TO IMPROVE THE DEPARTMENT I GREATLY APPRECIATE THAT EFFORT. AND PERHAPS YOU CAN TELL US THE DEGREE THAT YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO. WORK COOPERATIVELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT. FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM THE MEETING TWO TESTIMONIES. BARBER LEAVE THEIR NEW DIRECTOR AND THEIR NEW AND THEIR STAFF IS COMMITTED TO IMPROVE. I AM ALSO SENSITIVE TO THE MANY STAKE HOLDERS WHO FEEL THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORT TO IMPROVE NOT YET YIELDED THE POSITIVE BENEFITS. STAKEHOLDER YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR. I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM. IN THE PUBLIC COMMENT TODAY. FROM ANYONE WHO WANTS TO EXPRESS WHAT IMPROVEMENTS THEY'VE WITNESSED BY THE DEPARTMENT IN WEATHER FOR. WHATEVER. FUTURE CHANGES THEY WOULD SUGGEST. SIR THANK YOU AGAIN MR CRACKER FOR WORKING SO HARD WITH YOUR FELLOW PANELISTS THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. AND. I TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR REPORT THERE'S STILL A LOT THAT SON DONE. IF YOU COULD CONCENTRATE ON WHAT YOU THINK WE PARTICULARLY SHOULD JOB. MOVE ON IN THIS LEGISLATIVE YEAR THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WITH THAT IN WITH THE ONE CORRECTION THAT YOU ARE THE FORMER CHAIR IN NEED OF HELP EVERYBODY COUNTS. THIS WAS ONLY IF THEY HAD A TWO YEAR TERM BUT NONE THE LESS. PLEASE BEGIN WITH THE OVERVIEW THANK YOU HM A CASKEY CHAIR CORK AS SENATOR HILL STAFF. I THINK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY MY NAME IS GIDEONKRAKOFF I'M AN ENVIRONMENTAL ATTORNEY FROM LOS ANGELES. AND WITH THE SENATE RULES APPOINTEE IN THE CHAIR OF THE DTS SEEING APPEND REVIEW PANEL. OF THIS IS THE THIRD TIME I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE LEGISLATURE ON OUR WORK. WITH THE IN IN FRONT OF BOTH OF YOUR COMMITTEES I THINK ABOUT THIS TIME LAST YEAR. UPSTAIRS TALKING ABOUT OUR EFFORTS. ONE ALSO THAT MY OTHER PANEL MEMBERS OF VICE CHAIR MIKE BUSY WHO COULDN'T BE HERE TO TRAVEL COULDN'T TRAVEL TODAY. FROM SAN DIEGO AN ERISA CAMPBELL FROM ORANGE COUNTY. SO YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME. I'LL DO MY BEST BEAR WITH ME I HAVE THIS. TERRIBLE CHEST COLD. SO EITHER IT'S GONNA GET WORSE AS WE GO TODAY OR MAYBE IT'S GOING TO GET A LITTLE BIT BETTER AND LOOSEN UP. SO HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY I WAS TRYING TO THINK OF. SOME WAY TO. MIX VALENTINE'S DAY INDY TSC BUT I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT YET BUT MAYBE. MAYBE IT'S JUST SITTING THERE YOU CAN THINK OF SOME WITTY. WAY TO CONNECT THEM. SO. SENT ON OUR FINAL REPORT. YOU HAVE IT IN FRONT OF YOU. FOR WE SUNSET ON JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. THE REPORT MAKES OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT. AND ORGANIZES THEM INTO WHAT WE THINK SHOULD BE FIVE MAIN PRIORITIES. CONTINUITY IN EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP. HUMAN RESOURCES. FISCAL RESOURCES AND STRUCTURAL DEFICITS. TRANSPARENCY. AND FINALLY REVIEWING THE GOVERNING STATUTES TO CLEAN THEM UP. THEREPORT ALSO. LISTS ALL OUR PREVIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS AND METRICS. ALONG WITH THEIR STATUS IN THE APPENDICES. LET ME TOUCH BRIEFLY ON THESE FIVE TOPICS. FIRST JUST THE BACKGROUND. AS YOU KNOW WE WERE CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. WITH THREE MEMBERS. TO REVIEW AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING PERMITTING. ENFORCEMENT. PUBLIC OUTRAGE FISCAL MANAGEMENT. WE WERE TO REPORT TO YOU AND THE GOVERNOR EVERY NINETY DAYS. WE STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IN NOVEMBER AND WE HAD TWENTY EIGHT PUBLIC MEETINGS TO DISCUSS. YES HE'S WORK FROM STAKE HOLDERS ETCETERA. WE SUBMITTED OVER A HUNDRED REQUESTS FOR WRITTEN REPORTS. GOT MANY PRESENTATIONS FROM THE DEPARTMENT. TWENTY FIVE. TOTAL TO ONE THE EXCITED NOW WOULD YOU SITE. WE WANT TO THANK THE DIRECTOR AND HER STAFF FOR ALL THE TIME THEY SPENT WITH US. AS WELL AS OUR TWO GREAT INTERNAL STAFFERS. OFFICE AND MIKE SAYING. AND IN THE END AS YOU INDICATED. WE SUBMITTED ELEVEN REPORTS TO YOU. SO THE FIVE MAIN TOPICS TO IMPROVE. THE PROGRAMS AND THEN A SHORT CONCLUSION. THE FIRST IS THE CONTINUITY IN LEADERSHIP. THE DEPARTMENT HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT TURNOVER AT FIVE DIRECTORS SINCE TWENTY TEN. IN A PREVIOUS REPORT WE NOTED THAT THE FIFTEEN EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP POSITIONS EIGHT WERE HIRED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. IT'S STILL NEW EXECUTIVE TEAM. THE PTSD STAFF AGREE THAT THE TURNOVER AT THE EXECUTIVE LEVEL HAS A PROBLEM IN A PROBLEM. THAT'S BEEN DETRIMENTAL TO EMPLOYEE MORALE. HOWEVER THERE'S GOOD NEWS THERE. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS THERE IS A STABILIZED LEADERSHIP TEAM. THANKS TO DIRECTOR LEE. WHO'S BEEN THERE FOR OVER THREE YEARS. OF THE FIFTEEN KARTLI TO SHIP POSITIONS. ONLY ONE IS STAFFED BY A NEW HIRE ALTHOUGH THERE ARE TWO COVERED VACANCIES. THE NEXT LEVEL LEADERSHIP. THE SENIOR MANAGEMENT TWENTY NINE OF THIRTY ONE POSITIONS ARE STAFFED. SO THERE'S A BETTER STORY TO TELL THEIR. THERE HAS TO BE CONTINUITY AT THE TOP. BUT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO. ESPECIALLY AS ADMINISTRATIONS CHANGE ALSO THERE'S AN AGING WORKFORCE TO DGSE. FIFTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE EMPLOYEES ARE FIFTY ONE YEARS OLD. TO BE A WAVE OF RETIREMENTS AHEAD. THAT'S OPPORTUNITY BUT IT'S ALSO A CHALLENGE LOSING INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE. LEADERSHIP MATTERS. AND YOU ALL KNOW THIS. POINT TO. HUMAN RESOURCES. THE IRB STRONGLY FEELS THAT EVALUATING AND INSTITUTING CHANGES THE DTS THESE INTERNAL CULTURE IS CRITICAL. THE DEPARTMENT UNDERSTANDS THIS. BEGINNING AT TWENTY SIXTEEN AND EMBARKED ON AN ORGANIZATIONAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT. TO IDENTIFY STRENGTHS AND NEEDS A DOCUMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE. IN NOVEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN DTS HE REPORTED TO US ON THIS. AND THEY HAVE. THROUGH THERE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FRANCESCA NEDRY. MULTI YEAR ROADMAP. FOR TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT. ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS. INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT PLANS HAVE NOT BEEN HAPPENING. THE NEW HIRING IN RECRUITMENT PLAN. BETTER EMPLOYEE RECOGNITION. PEER MENTORING AND BEST PRACTICES FOR PROJECT PLANNING. AND THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PERFORMANCE METRICS TO MONITOR HOW THEY'RE DOING WITH ALL OF THIS. WE AGREE THERE SHOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT. BUT AGAIN THE FUTURE BUDGETS AND FUTURE LEADERSHIP HAVE TO MAKE THAT A PRIORITY. BUT IT'S CERTAINLY IMPROVING THE CULTURE AN HR ADJUST DEPARTMENT. SHOULD BE A PRIORITY. NEXT. THREE STABLE FISCAL RESOURCES. IT STARTS ON PAGE THIRTEEN OF OUR REPORT. FUNDING IN INFLATION ADJUSTED DOLLARS HAS NOT KEPT PACE WITH INCREASED RESPONSIBILITIES WITH SOME CHARTS SHOWING THIS AS WELL AS THE STRUCTURAL DEFICITS STARTING ON PAGE THIRTEEN. DTS HE'S FIGHTING HAS DECREASED. IF THE SPECIAL RECENT BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS FOR ARGONAUT AND EXCITED ARE NOT INCLUDED. BY SEVENTEEN PERCENT SINCE NINETEEN NINETY ONE. MOREOVER THE DEPARTMENT'S TWO LARGEST FUNDING SOURCES FACE STRUCTURAL DEFICITS. THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACCOUNT TOSCA. THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL ACCOUNT THE H. WCA. THIS PROBLEM S EXPECTED TO CONTINUE. BASED ON PROJECTED REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES. OF PARTICULAR CONCERN IS A SITE MEDIATION ACCOUNT. FUNDED BY TOSCA. COULD USE FOR DIRECTOR MEDIATION COSTS ON FEDERAL SUPERFUND ORPHAN SITES THERE ARE RESPONSIBILITIES. I THINK THIS YEAR THE COST OR COMMITMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO EXCEED OUR APPROPRIATIONS. THAT MAY LEAVE NO MONEY FOR ORPHANS SITE CLEANUPS. THE LESSON PRESSURE ON THE ACCOUNTS. AND TO ADDRESS THE TRUE COST OF PROCESSING PERMIT APPLICATIONS. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. THE BUDGET ACT ELIMINATED THE FLAT FEE FOR APPLICANTS IN PERMITTING. HOWEVER. THE REGULATED COMMUNITY IS EXPRESSED UNHAPPINESS WITH THE SERVICE FEE REQUIREMENT. THAT IT'S TOO OPEN ENDED. ONE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE US MILITARY. ASSERTED. TO US. APPLICATION COSTS HAVE NOW INCREASED. TENFOLD. ON THE OTHER HAND FUNDING IS NECESSARY FOR MANY CRITICAL PROGRAMS. THE PERMIT BACKLOG. OF EXPIRED PERMITS EXPECTED TO LAST UNTIL AT LEAST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SENATORS. REVIEWING EACH PERMITS FACILITIES FINANCIAL ASSURANCES EVERY FIVE YEARS. MANDATED INSPECTION FREQUENCIES THAT DON'T EXIST RIGHT NOW. STAFFING AND GROWTH IN THE NEW OFFICE OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND TRIBAL AFFAIRS YOU. CONSUMER PRODUCTS GREEN CHEMISTRY UNIT. SO IT CAN MEET ITS FULL POTENTIAL. THE ADMINISTRATION NOTED AS A AS YOU INDICATED CHAIR WERE CASTING. A CHAIR CORK THE LINK BETWEEN FUNDING AND PERFORMANCE. ITS VETO MESSAGE FROM LAST YEAR. REGARDING SEVERAL OF. BUT THE RP BELIEVES PARTIES NEEDED. REFORMS. THE GOVERNOR INDICATED THAT ADDING NEW RESPONSIBILITIES TO DEPARTMENT MUST BE UNDERTAKEN HOLISTICALLY WELL CONSIDERING RESOURCES. AND FUNDING THAT IS AVAILABLE. SO THE BUDGET AND THE FUNDING IS IMPORTANT. BUT A RELATED ISSUE THEREFORE IS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. PRIORITY FOR. TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY SHOULD BE IMPORTANT PRIORITIES FOR ALL OF US. THEY'RE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE. OF THE CONTINUATION OF DTS THESE RECENT IMPROVEMENTS AT ASSURANCES TO YOU. BUT THE RESOURCE ALLOCATIONS SUPPORT GOOD INVESTMENTS. TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ARE NEEDED TO MONITOR DTS IS ONGOING INITIATIVES THAT I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. AND FRANKLY IT'S DECISION MAKING ON PROJECTS LIKE EXILE. THE TSC. HAS A HISTORY OF MISSING DEADLINES. OFTEN SELF IMPOSED DEADLINES THAT ARE NOT REALISTIC. THERE'S A LONG LIST OF THESE ON PAGE TWENTY EIGHT OF OUR REPORT. FOR EXAMPLE. DESPITE THE I. R. P. BREATHING DOWN THEIR NECKS. PTSD IS MISSED THE DEADLINE UNDER SB SIX SEVENTY THREE TO ADOPT REGULATIONS ESTABLISHING OR UPDATING CRITERIA. FOR HAZARDOUS WASTE PERMITS IT WAS DUE BY JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. HASN'T BEEN DONE. THEY ARE BIG KNOWLEDGE IS. THAT INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES PLAY A ROLE IN MISSTEP ONCE. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE DTS HE CAN DO MORE. TO SET REALISTIC DEADLINES AND CONSIDER HOW TO ACHIEVE A BALANCE BETWEEN TIMELINESS. AND GOOD WORK PRODUCT YOU HAVE TO HAVE BOTH. OF COURSE IF THE GOVERNOR AND YOU SEE THE DTS IS DOING HIGH QUALITY WORK ON TIME. YOU'LL BE MORE LIKELY TO GIVE THE DEPARTMENT THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT WHEN RESOURCES ARE NEEDED. SO. DESPITE RECENT IMPROVEMENTS. WHICH WE DO IT KNOWLEDGE FOR SURE. COMMUNITY BUSINESS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT STAKE HOLDERS STILL BELIEVE THERE IS MUCH WORK TO NEEDS TO BE DONE. IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY. THE COMMUNITY IS EXPRESSED DISSATISFACTION WITH PROPOSED CIVIL RIGHTS AND LANGUAGE ACCESS POLICIES. BUSINESS STAKEHOLDERS CRITICIZED PERMIT APPLICATION SERVICE FEES AND CHARGES FRIEND DIRECT COSTS. WHAT COUNTY? AND SUPERVISOR SO WE SIT HERE TODAY. HAS CRITICIZED ELEMENTS OF THE EXXON CLEANUP. FIRST SANTA SUSANNA CONSIDER STORMS DISTRICT. AND AGAIN THIS IS FROM A FARM THIS PERSON'S OPINION. IT'S UNCLEAR TO ME. WHETHER THE RELEASE OF THE RECENT DRAFTEE I ARE IS REALLY GOING TO PROVE. A SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD. NOW. THE I RP WAS AN ENTITY THAT STAKE HOLDERS COULD APPROACH TO EXPRESS CONCERNS ASK QUESTIONS AND LEARN. BUT WE ARE GONE NOW. SO THE PANEL MEMBERS TO WONDER WHERE STAKEHOLDERS WILL GO. IN THE ABSENCE OF THE IRP. AND WHO ON A REGULAR BASIS. IS GOING TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF ALL THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. AND METRICS. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE AGREES ISSUED A REPORT IN APRIL OF LAST YEAR. THAT CONTINUED OVERSIGHT IS NEEDED. THE R. P. HAS MADE RECOMMENDATIONS ALONG THESE LINES. INCLUDING. THE GREAT AN OVERSIGHT BOARD OR OTHER STRUCTURAL CHANGE TOIMPROVE ACCOUNTABILITY. AND TRANSPARENCY. FINALLY PARTY FIVE. THE GOVERNING STATUTES THAT MAY NEED REVISION OR REPEAL AND HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE. SHOULD BE REVIEWED TO IMPROVE ORGANIZATION LEMONADE OBSOLETE PROVISIONS AND STRENGTHEN SOME PROVISIONS THAT ARE NOT WORKING PROPERLY. I CAN JUST TOUCH BRIEFLY ON ONE AND THEN I'LL CONCLUDE. HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTIONS TWO FIVE ONE THREE FIVE. THROUGH POINT NINE. ARE EXAMPLES OF A STATUTE THAT ARE NOT WORKING PROPERLY. YEARS AGO. THESE ESTABLISHED A REQUIREMENT TO PRODUCE A STATE HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN. BUT NINETEEN NINETY ONE. IT WAS TO BE REVIEWED ANNUALLY AND REVISED ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS. IT WAS TO BE PREPARED CONJUNCTION WITH PLANTS ADOPTED BY COUNTIES AND REGIONAL COUNCILS. BUT. SOMETIMES THE PLANS WERE AND SUBMITTED OR THEY COULD NOT BE APPROVED. SO AS A RESULT THE STATE WIDE HAZARDOUS WASTE PLANNING PRACTICE IS NOT WHAT IT SHOULD BE. THE SECTION SHOULD BE REPLACED BY A NEW PLANNING PROCESS. WE'VE HEARD FROM ALL STAKEHOLDERS. AND IT REALLY HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO LEAVE YOU ON THIS. THE STATE HAS AN OBLIGATION TO MANAGE TREAT DISPOSE OF ITS WASTE WITHOUT SHIPPING IT TO OTHER STATES OR COUNTRIES. THIS IS OUR OBLIGATION AS A STATE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR WASTE. SIR ISSUE OF FAIRNESS AND OF OUR MIDDLE JUSTICE. BUT THE RESPONSIBLE WAY TO ACCOMPLISH THIS IS TO THINK STATE WHAT TO THINK FAIRLY. DECIDE THESE FACILITIES IN A WAY THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE DO NOT ALWAYS BEAR. A DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN. IT REQUIRES PLANNING PROBABLY SOME NEW STATUTORY AUTHORITY. AND FUNDING. BUT ANY OF IT. THE GOVERNING STATUTES WILL CREATE REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS. AND HELP THE TSC FOCUS ON ITS MISSION. SO IN BRIEF CONCLUSION DGSE HAS MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS OVER THESE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS. THE GOVERNOR. INDEED HE IS THE DIRECTOR WE STABILIZE THE LEADERSHIP TEAM. PTSD IS WORKING. TO EVALUATE ITS ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE. AND YOUR BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS HAVE MADE A REAL DIFFERENCE FOR COST RECOVERY. PERMITTING. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND CERTAINLY FOR EXIDE. AND THE PROBLEM IS WORKING ON MANY OF THE MATRIX IN OUR REPORT. BUT THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE. THE DEPARTMENT IS ONLY BEGINNING TO CONSIDER AND IMPLEMENT ITS ORGANIZATIONAL PLANS. YOU HAVE THESE TWO SERIOUS STRUCTURAL DEFICITS. IT'S NOT YET CERTAIN WHETHER DTS SEES PUBLIC PARTICIPATION THAT AJ WORK WILL REALLY LEAD TO IN DURING IMPROVEMENTS. THERE'S STILL A REAL CHALLENGE. BETWEEN BALANCING WORK PRODUCT. QUALITY. AND TIMELINESS. SO IN LIGHT OF ALL THIS. LEAVE THERE'S A CONTINUED NEED. TO ENHANCE TRANSPARENCY. REGULARLY MONITOR HOW THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING WITH METRICS. AS WELL AS TO INQUIRE INTO ITS ONGOING. FINISHES AND DECISION MAKING. PART OF THAT OF COURSE. IS YOUR ROLE. THANK YOU FOR LETTING US SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. THIS OPPORTUNITY CHAIRS. AND I'M CERTAINLY AVAILABLE TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS OF MY VOICE CAN HOLD UP. THANK YOU. LET'S START OFF AT THE END WHERE YOU CONCLUDED. WITH A NEW FRAMEWORK. AND YOU KNOW SOME SOURCE REDUCTION CAN YOU FLESH THAT OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE WHAT THAT. LOOKS LIKE I MEAN I I SEE THE ONE SIDE IS A TEDIOUS CODE WORK TO LOOK FOR REDUNDANCIES AND GO OVER. THIRTY YEARS OF. OF FINE LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS PRIDE BUT WHAT TO HOW HUGE IS THAT. NEW FRAMEWORK. ORIENTATION. SUGGESTING. IT. SO IT. I GUESS THERE'S TWO QUESTIONS THERE. THE. THE FIRST QUESTION IS ABOUT THE. YOU KNOW THE THE HEALTH. SAFETY CODE. EXCERPTS. WHICH YOU CAN. YOU CAN FIND YOU KNOW RIGHT HERE. TO HAVE HAPPENED THROUGH THE YEARS AT IF YOU LOOK AT THIS DEPARTMENT REGULATIONS ACTUALLY ARE QUITE SMALL IN COMPARISON TO THE CODE. WHAT SEEMS TO HAPPEN THROUGH THE YEARS IS THAT THERE'S BEEN? THROUGH ACCRETION. EACH YEAR. A NEW ISSUE A NEW CHALLENGE HAS BEEN DETERMINED FOR THE DEPARTMENT IT'S BEEN PUT IN THE LEGISLATION. BUT AS A RESULT MAYBE TO DEAL WITH THE NEEDS OF THE DEPARTMENT OR. OTHER. MERGING ISSUES. YOU GET A CODE THAT IS THIS. LARGE. IT DOESN'T ALWAYS CROSS REFERENCE THEY'RE OBSOLETE THINGS LIKE THE HAZARDOUS WASTE. ABOUT PLANNING STATUTES THAT ARE REFERENCED. AND. IT BECOMES REALLY DIFFICULT EITHER FROM YOU KNOW LAWYERS TO TO TRULY UNDERSTAND. SO IT'S A VERY VERY LARGE JOB TO DO THAT MAYBE IT IS SOMETHING. THAT FRANKLY IN THE END PROVED TO BE. INFEASIBLE BUT WE MADE THE RECOMMENDATION THAT THE. LAW REVISION COMMISSION OR SOMEBODY VERY SMART. YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY BE LOCKED IN A ROOM FOR A FEW MONTHS IN AND TRIED TO YOU KNOW SHRINK THIS DOWN. SO THAT CROSS REFERENCES AND IT'S. BETTER. EASIER TO MANAGE. THE SECOND ISSUE IS ABOUT THE STRUCTURE. I THINK IT'S RELATED ISSUE. THERE HAVE BEEN. ISSUES AT THE DEPARTMENT FOR ALL THE REASONS WE DISCUSSED IN THE FIVE PRIORITIES IN OUR REPORT. AND AGAIN I THINK. PERHAPS INSTEAD OFFIGURING OUT IN THIS GOES BACK TO THE HISTORY OF THE DEPARTMENT WHICH CAME OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANY YEARS AGO. THAT MAYBE MAYBE THE STRUCTURE. YEAH. AS. THE NEED. FOR EXAMINERS. MAYBE WHAT USED TO BE MORE OF A PERMITTING AGENCY IS NOT REALLY MORE OF A SITE CLEANUP AGENCY. WITH EXTENSIVE STAKEHOLDER CONCERNED ABOUT ALL THE SITES UP AND DOWN THE STATE IN MAYBE THE STRUCTURE THAT WORKED WHAT WAS SPLIT OFF IN THE NINETIES FROM D. PH. OR THE EIGHTIES ISN'T WHAT IT SHOULD BE TODAY. MAYBE INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT THOSE STRUCTURAL ISSUES. WHAT WHAT A SWITCHER IS DONE INSTEAD IS ADD A DISPATCHER THAT STATUTE? AND MAYBE NOW TWENTY YEARS LATER. IT'S NOT REALLY WHERE YOU WANT TO BE. WHERE MAYBE YOU'VE GOT A STRUCTURE THAT PERHAPS DOESN'T FIT? WHAT THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING? THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE THIS CODE. THAT IS VERY UNWIELDY. I DON'T HAVE A SILVER BULLET FOR YOU WANT BUT THE BEST STRUCTURE SHOULD BE. UP. THERE IS A CONCERN THAT ALL THE WORK WE'VE HAD ALL THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. YOU WANNA WORST CASE IS JUST GONNA BE ANOTHER REPORT IT'S PUT ON THE SHELF THAT NOBODY READS AND THERE'S BEEN SO MANY REPORTS ON THIS DEPARTMENT. AND WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. AND THERE WAS NOT CONSENSUS AMONG THE PANEL WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST STRUCTURE. BUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT. IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO HANDLE IN A. TRANSPARENT WAITED DOESN'T EXIST NOW. IT'S IT'S A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT. CORE MISSION TO PERMIT SITES THAT ARE HANDLING YOUR WAIST AND THEN DEALING WITH. THE REPERCUSSIONS OF ALL THAT HANDLING OF WASTED MAYBE THE MISHANDLING OF THE WAYS THAT'S CREATED. CONTAMINATION AND HAZARDS ON THOSE SITES AGAIN I THINK IT GETS BACK TO THE YEAR THE LARGER QUESTION THAT YOU HAVE IS THAT YOU KNOW. EVERYBODY IN MODERN CALIFORNIA. EXPECT CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES EXPECTS CERTAIN A CERTAIN STANDARD OF LIVING DECREASE JUST WASTES NO WE CAN WORK ON THAT THAT ONE SIDE TO REDUCE THE SOURCE OF CREATING WAYS BUT WHAT WE DO THAT I MEAN I. HAVE SAID PUBLICLY. AND AGREE WITH YOU THAT THAT WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO RECYCLE OUR BATTERIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE ANSWER IS NOT JUST TO SHIP THEM OUT. OUT NOW. IS CERTAINLY VERNON DOESN'T WANT A SITE BECAUSE THEY FEEL THEY'VE HAD THE SITE AT EXCITE BUT WE STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THESE TECHNOLOGIES IN MODERN SOCIETY AND AND AS I MAKE A LAW THAT SAYS THIS IS NOW COULD BE HAZARDOUS WASTE PRODUCT IN. CALIFORNIA I DON'T ALWAYS THINK ABOUT WHERE IS IT GOING TO GO AND WHAT'S THE TREATMENT OF THAT SO UNIT. IS THAT WHAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT IS THIS WHOLE RESTRUCTURING OF THAT THE HELL WE HANDLE WASTE INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING GET IT OUT OF MY YOU KNOW. OFF AT THIS LOCATION AND PUT IT SOMEWHERE. IF THAT SEEMS TO BE THE THE RESPONSIBLE A WAY TO ADDRESS IT AND. DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN SO CAUGHT UP IN. THE DAY TO DAY WHETHER IT'S EXIDE SAID TO SUSANNAH. HUNTERS POINT. AND TRYING TO ADDRESS THESE. VERY EXISTENCE FROM STANCES THAT I I THINK IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT TO STEP BACK AND DO SOME OF THIS PLANNING ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE POOR TALKS ABOUT IS THAT THE SOURCE REDUCTION EFFORTS. HAVE FALLEN BY THE WAYSIDE A LITTLE BIT AS OTHER PRIORITIES HAVE BEEN PUT IN THIS CODE SO I THINK STEPPING BACK AND GIVING THE DEPARTMENT. AND THE LEGISLATURE. IN THE ABILITY TO BREATHE A LITTLE BIT AND FIGURE OUT. WHERE ARE WE GOING WITH THIS IS THIS THE BEST? WAY TO HANDLE IT I THINK IS THE RESPONSIBLE THING. BUT GOING BACK AGAIN TO YOUR QUESTION ON WHAT A STRUCTURE-COULD LOOK LIKE SOME THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER IS. NO REGULATIONS. IT'S VERY COMMON FOR GOVERNING BOARDS TO HAVE REGULATORY AUTHORITY IN PUBLIC TO CONSIDER. YOU HAD A GOVERNING BOARD WITH AUTHORITY. WHICH WE CERTAINLY DIDN'T HAVE. THESE REGULATIONS ON SIX SEVENTY THREE WOULD BE DONE BY NOW. EARN THE METRICS AND ALL THE INTERNAL THINGS THAT THE R. P. PUT TOGETHER THAT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT IS LOOKED AT. CERTAINLY EXIDE WHICH IS GOING TO GO ON FOR MANY MANY YEARS TO DO THAT IN A TRANSPARENT WAY. WITH APPOINTEES. BUT THE STORY. EXPERIENCED WITH FIXED TERMS SO THAT THEY HAVE INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY THAT ALSO CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THIS. LEADERSHIP TURNOVER MIGHT BE VALUABLE BUT OF COURSE. TO DO THIS IN A PUBLIC WAY WITH THE PUBLIC WHETHER IT'S FOR A PARTICULAR SITE OR OTHER THINGS CAN COME. GET ANSWERS HAVE A BOARD THAT CARES WITH SOME AUTHORITY TRY TO TO GET QUESTIONS AND BREAK THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF THE INSULARITY. THAT SOME STILL OBSERVE WITH THIS DEPARTMENT. THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT. YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT A NEW STRUCTURE I THINK YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THAT AGAIN THAT'S JUST REALLY SPEAKING FOR ME. THERE WAS NOT A CONSENSUS AMONG THE PANEL ON HOW TO DO THIS WE LEFT IT TO YOUR BRIGHTER MINDS. BUT. I'VE GOT TO GO BACK TO. TWO THOUSAND TEN WHEN I GOT ELECTED AND I HAD A GERMAN CORKS JOB ET. VIRAL SAFETY IN TOXIC MATERIAL SO I'VE HAD PLENTY OF. HEARINGS ON HIGH. DTS SEE. AND THERE'S ALWAYS EEN THIS CHALLENGE I GUESS OF THE LAST EIGHT YEARS THE CHICKEN AND THE EGG DO WE GIVE THE DEPARTMENT MORE MONEY WITH MORE POSITIONS TO FIX IT OR THEY GET A FUNDAMENTALLY FIX. THE WAY THAT THEY OPERATE I THINK SOME OF THE TRANSPARENCY PRIORITIES. ATTACHED AT THE QUESTION IS IS ON THE. THE SACRED MEDIATION ACCOUNT AND THAT TOXIC SUBSTANCE CONTROL ACCOUNT THIS SEEMS YOU'VE HIGHLIGHTED THOSE ACCOUNTS IS BEING SHORT OF MONEY. IT AND WE'VE ALWAYS YOU YOUR TESTIMONY AND THE REPORT INDICATES THAT THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY FEELS LIKE. THEY. TEN TIMES AS MUCH FOR THAT THE SERVICES IS ENOUGH IS THAT A GENERAL FUND. PRIORITY THAT THAT THAT THAT THE. THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE LOOKING AT TWO TO AUGMENT NOW IT'S SO THAT WE DON'T. WE DON'T START CHASING ALL THE. PROBLEMS THAT HAVE OCCURRED OR WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT ARE OCCURRING ARE ORPHANED SITES IN THE SUPERFUND SITES. YEAH I. I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT QUESTION. OF. THE ACCOUNTS DO HAVE STRUCTURAL DEFICITS. WHY EXACTLY THAT IS? WHERE ARE? APPROPRIATE FEES. MIGHT BE. HOW WE ARE PLANNING FOR THE FUND SITES GET TURNED OVER TO THE STATE WHICH THEN INCREASES THE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE? COSTS FOR THE STATE I THINK IT BE WORTH WHILE AND. JUST BE HONEST WITH YOU HAVING CRUNCH THE NUMBERS TO REALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. WITH CERTAINTY BUT IT BE WORTH WHILE I THINK FOR YOUR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEES AND OTHERS TO REALLY LOOK AT THIS. AND DETERMINE. YOU KNOW WHAT ENDED DEPARTMENTS WRITTEN SOME REPORTS ON THIS ON THIS SR EIGHT. SHORTFALL. REALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE AND. AND. WHERE THE DEPARTMENT IS IN TERMS OF ITS FUNDING BUT AGAIN? I THINK A PART OF THAT HAS TO DEAL WITH ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU FEEL THAT THE DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT WISELY. AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS MEETING ITS EXPECTATIONS ONE OF THE THINGS I'LL MENTION. IS. EITHER HAD BEEN A LOT OF. BUDGET. OF CHANGE CHANGES. AND FINANCE LETTERS ETCETERA THAT HAVE BEEN MADE FOR THE DEPARTMENT DIFFERENT THINGS OVER THE PAST. THREE TO FIVE YEARS AND WE ASKED THE DEPARTMENT AND WHAT THEY DO IS. WHEN THEY. MAKE THOSE REQUESTS OF YOU THEY PUT TOGETHER WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO. WITH CERTAIN TIME LINES AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND WE ASK THE DEPARTMENT HEY. LET'S LOOK AT THOSE LAST FIVE YEARS A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS AND. TELL US HAVE YOU MET ALL THE THINGS YOU WERE GOING TO DO. AND FRANKLY WE THAT REPORT WE DIDN'T GET UNTIL OUR LAST MEETING AND IT WAS REALLY TOO LATE TO ANALYZE IT. MAYBE IT'S YOUR JOB TO LOOK AT THAT STUFF BUT AGAIN YOU HAVE SO MANY OTHER PRIORITIES. SO I I THINK THERE IS SOME AND THE MINISTRATIONS CERTAINLY IS LOOKING AT THAT NO DOUBT. BE HELPFUL. FOR WHICH IN A TRANSPARENT WAY TO HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE BUDGET. I MEAN THERE'S THERE ARE THE STATES OR FAN SITES THAT THE ORPHAN FOR REASON WE DON'T HAVE A RESPONSIBLE PERSON AND NOW WE'RE GETTING THE FEDERALS WERE FAN SITES THAT ARE COMING IN AND WE AND WE KNOW THAT WE'RE SHORT OF. OF JOE ON THE ON THE POSITIONS ON PAGE TWENTY REFERENCE THE FIVE. POSITIONS THAT WERE REDIRECTED FROM. THE. WHERE WAS THAT CONFERENCE THERE WERE FIVE SITES THAT WERE READ TO RID OUR FIVE POSITIONS THAT WERE REDIRECTED FOR? AS I GUESS THE REMEDIATION WORK AND YOUR RECOMMENDATION IS THAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT MAKING THOSE PERMANENT RATHER THAN RE DIRECT THEM. AND I MADE A NOTE IN. I SHOULD ADMIT A DASH HERE. BECAUSE YOU WENT THROUGH THIS SITE MITIGATION REPORT AND THAT'S IN THE SECTION WHERE WE'VE GOT WE CREATED THESE LIMITED TERMS SEVERAL YEARS OF LIMITED TERM. POSITIONS. AND THEN THERE WERE FIVE REDIRECTED POSITIONS. IN MY READING. YEAH THAT'S RIGHT. IF THAT WAS RECOMMENDATION I THINK WAS MADE. YEAH EARLY ON. THE IF YOU RECALL THERE WAS A BIG ISSUE WITH HUNDREDS OF. HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OR SOMETHING OF COST RECOVERY THAT THE DEPARTMENT HADN'T PURSUED. AND THEY BROUGHT THOSE PEOPLE AND. TO SORT OF THOUGHT IT THROUGH THAT. I THINK THERE'S TWO OBSERVATIONS TO MAKE ON THAT ONE IS. THAT IN THE END MOST OF THOSE COSTS WERE SIMPLY WRITTEN OFF. THAT MONEY WAS LOST. THE OTHER OBSERVATION WHICH IS MORE POSITIVE IS THAT I THINK THOSE POSITIONS IN THE DEPARTMENT AS A WHOLE HAVE MUCH BETTER COST RECOVERY PROCEDURES IN PLACE. I'M CONFIDENT THE GOING FORWARD WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THAT KIND OF PROBLEM AGAIN. ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING. AT ANOTHER THING THAT'S RELATED TO THAT IS THE TECHNOLOGY. DEPARTMENT MADE THE TRANSITION TO A CALIPHATES FISCALE BUT STILL THEY'RE BILLING PRISSY. I T. TECHNOLOGY IS OUTDATED THAT MADE A REQUEST TO GET A NEW SYSTEM IN PLACE BUT THAT WAS LIKE FIVE STEPS TO TAKE TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO. THE I. T. HAVE TO BE IMPROVED OF. THESE POSITIONS I THINK PARTICULARLY THOSE FIVE WERE TO GET THE COST RECOVERY HOUSE IN ORDER. I THINK WE FEEL THAT THE COST RECOVERY HOUSE IS IN ORDER NOW. AND I THINK THERE WAS A REASON WHY. IN A YEAR AND A HALF TWO YEARS LATER THOSE POSITIONS CAN BE REPURPOSED. OKAY A GERMAN COURT QUESTIONS. TOM PERSONAL LOAN ACCOUNT. EMPLOYMENT CHAIRMAN WHY CASKEY IN. BRINGING UP ALL THOSE QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE VERY LITTLE LEFT TO SAY. YES EXCELLENT JOB SENATOR. FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR HARD WORK AND. DID YOU FEEL DURING THE COURSE OF TIME PARTICULARLY AFTER. DIRECTOR LEE CAME ON BOARD THAT YOU WERE GETTING GOOD COOPERATION IN YOUR. EXAMINATION OF THE DEPARTMENT FROM DEPARTMENT MEMBERS. YES I THINK THE ANSWER IS YES. OF. THE DEPARTMENT. BUT. DID ITS BEST TO PROVIDE US WITH. THE INFORMATION AND THEY SIGNED A STAFFER TO HELP US. AND THAT WAS A LOT OF WORK FOR THEM AND APPLAUD THE DIRECTOR. UP FOR THAT. ONE THING TO MENTION IS SORT OF OUR INDEPENDENT IN A ROLE. AND. OF. PERHAPS IN THE BEGINNING WHAT SOME THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT. WHERE? THE I RP WAS SORT OF PART OF THE TEAM. I I THINK. TOWARDS THE END SORT OF THE INDEPENDENT ROLE OF THE DEPARTMENT. YOU KNOW SORT OF YOUR PREVENTED THAT A LITTLE BIT IF YOU FOLLOW ME NOBODY LIKES INSPECTOR GENERAL OR AN INDEPENDENT BODY RUNNING AROUND IN THE DEPARTMENT. I'D HOPE THAT THERE WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT. DIFFERENT OF A RELATIONSHIP IN THE END IT DIDN'T REALLY TURN OUT. TO BE THAT WAY IT WAS A LITTLE BIT MORE OF AN ARM'S LENGTH TYPE OF. A RELATIONSHIP. SO FOR EXAMPLE. IN THE END THE. THE RP WAS NOT ALLOWED. FOR WAS STRONGLY. RECOMMENDED AGAINST GOING AND VISITING THE DISTRICT OFFICES TO SORT OF INTERVIEW THE STAFF. CANDID WAY TO SORT OF GET TO KNOW THEM. THE. DEPARTMENT THOUGHT IT WOULD BE DISRUPTIVE SO WE ENDED UP NOT DOING THAT. WE GOT OTHER INFORMATION IN OTHER WAYS THAT THE DEPARTMENT FOUND. MORE APPROPRIATE. SO THEY WORK VERY HARD. YOU CAN SEE THAT. MOUNT OF INFORMATION THEY GAVE US. AND WHAT IT THANK THEM FOR THAT. BUT I'LL SAY IN FAIRNESS IT WAS A BIT OF A ARM'S LENGTH RELATIONSHIP. SO I'M. THAT'S INTERESTING SO I WAS A MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT WITH MCKINSEY AND COMPANY OVER COURSE OF THE YEAR. I THINK IT I THINK IT'S A SHAME YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO TALK TO FOLKS BECAUSE ARM. TALKING TO PEOPLE CANDIDLY ABOUT THEIR JOBS YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN A LOT MORE THAN YOU CAN FROM JUST READING REPORTS. SO CERTAINLY I WOULD RECOMMEND SO. SENATOR. CONNIE LEIVA. WHOSE DISTRICT THIS IS DAN HAS RECOMMEND HAS A BILL WHICH WOULD SET UP. AN INDEPENDENT BOARD. ARE YOU AWARE OF THIS BILL. IT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER HERE BUT I TEN POINT I'D APPRECIATE ANY DOUBLE THAT BILL IS ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR WHETHER WORKING OUT DETAILS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. SHE ATE ANY INSIGHTS YOU HAVE EITHER NOW OR LATER ON. TALKING DIRECTLY WITH SARAH OUR OFFICES. INTO WHAT YOU SEE IS THE PLUSES AND MINUSES OF THAT WAY THAT BOARD IS STRUCTURED. YEAH I'LL DEFINITELY. BE AVAILABLE TO COMMENT ON THAT TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE BILL LATELY. ALL RIGHT WELL CERTAINLY OUR STAFFS WILL GET A HOLD OF YOU. AND DAD TRY AND GET YOUR INPUT ON THAT AND I I DO THINK IT IS IMPORTANT. THAT. WE'RE DEAD IF THERE IS A FOLLOW ON BOARD. THAT'D BE ABLE TO TALK WITH PEOPLE IN A. HE'S A RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE FRANKLY THE PEOPLE AT THE. AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL KNOW MORE ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON AND HOW TO FIX IT THAN ANYONE ELSE DOES AND I CAN TELL YOU IN MY EXPERIENCE. AS A MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT DOING MUCH THE SAME KIND OF WORK YOU DID THAT THE BEST INFORMATION. COME FROM THE PEOPLE DIRECTLY WHO DO THE JOBS DIRECTLY SO I THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT AND WILL. MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS IN EXPLICITLY. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T FIGHT. AND THREATENED TO VETO THE BILL. I THINK IT'S ESSENTIAL WE PUT IT IN THERE AND WE'LL DO I'LL DO ALL WE CAN TO GET IT IN THERE. GO AHEAD YEAH CERTAINLY AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS. YOU WANT TO PUT SOMETHING IN PLACE THAT'S GONNA MAKE THE DEPARTMENT FUNCTION. BETTER. MORE SMOOTHLY. WE DON'T WANT TO PUT. NEW STRUCTURES IN PLACE THEY'RE GONNA SLOW THINGS DOWN RIGHT AND AND. GUM UP THE WORKS SO AGAIN IT IS IT'S THERE'S. THIS BALANCE OF MAKING SURE THAT THE JOB GETS DONE WELL AND ON TIME. AND. WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT WHAT WHAT IF ANYTHING COMES AFTER THE RP CERTAINLY KEEP THAT IN MIND. VERY GOOD. SO THERE CERTAINLY IS AN ISSUE OF RESOURCES. THERE ALSO IS PROBABLY AN ISSUE OF STREAMLINING OF. THINGS THAT GET IN THE WAY OF DOING THE JOB. SO THOSE ARE ALSO THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT. AS WE STUDY A REPORT FURTHER AND AS WE LOOK AT PERHAPS RE DRAFTING. THE LEGISLATION. WE WOULD CERTAINLY COME BACK TO YOU AND THE DEPARTMENT AND TALK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO THAT WOULD MAKE THE DEPARTMENT'S WORK COME OFF MORE QUICKLY. AND HOPEFULLY LESS EXPENSIVELY. YES SEVEN I THOUGHT I WAS ALL DONE BUT TO IF YOU. WANT TO COME HOME NOW WILL WILL WILL TALK TO YOU AND WE'LL ALSO TALK TO THE DEPARTMENT. AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. IF THERE ARE STRUCTURAL CHANGES THAT CAN SPEED UP THE WORK SO THANK YOU. I DID FORGET ONE QUESTION I WANT TO ASK YOU AND UNDER THE FIRST PRIORITY TO LEADERSHIP HE TALKED ABOUT THE CRIMINAL. OFFICER CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS IN THE ENFORCEMENT AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM BECAUSE WE'RE WAITING FOR A FINAL REPORT FROM THE. THE ERT ON THEIR INISH INITIAL pA CONFERENCE OF STUDY THAT OF WHAT POSITIONS THAT THEY NEED. AND. NATURALLY RESOURCES. CAN YOU PUT. TAKE THAT CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE ON EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND ENFORCEMENT IF THEY DO NEED RESOURCES. PUT YOUR TRANSPARENCY. LANDS ON THAT AND WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS ARE YOU WHAT ARE THE. HOW DO WE IMPROVE THAT? RESPONSE TEAM WITH REGARD TO THE PUBLIC AND THE DEBT IS THE TRANSPARENCY. GOALS THAT HAVE BEEN ARTICULATED THE OTHER. HE'S. WELL I MEAN. I GET OR SHOULD WE I GUESS IF YOU PUT YOUR MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT YOU KNOW HAT BACK ON AND YOU KNOW YOU FOLKS. YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF EXPERTISE IN. AND TRYING TO AS SORT OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE VARIOUS. YOU KNOW. FOLKS IN STATE GOVERNMENT ARE. A FIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS THIS PARTICULAR UNIT HAS. HAD A LOT OF LEADERSHIP AND STAFFING PROBLEMS THROUGH THE YEARS WHEN WE TRY TO DO IS GIVE THEM CERTAIN METRICS. YOU KNOW. CONDOMS HOW MANY CASES ARE YOU FILING IT'LL. AND IT'S ALL IN THE REPORT YOU KNOW HOW MANY HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE YOU TO DO. WHAT KIND OF PENALTIES ARE YOU OF PUTTING TOGETHER WHAT YOUR STAFF TURNOVER? WE TRIED OUR BEST TO SENATORS IN. YOU KNOW. TRY TO GIVE SOME OBJECTIVE CRITERIA AND HOW TO MEASURE HOW THESE FOLKS ARE DOING OTHER THING AND JUST TO BE CANDID WITH THE DEPARTMENT IS. THIS PAY. SOME OF THESE JOBS THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR UNIT DON'T PAY AS MUCH AS SOME OF THE COUNTIES. OR CITIES DO. SO IT'S HARD FOR THEM AND JOSH KNOWS THAT MISTER TOOGOOD KNOWS THIS FROM HIS TIME THERE IT'S HARD TO ATTRACT GOOD PEOPLE AND KEEP THEM. BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING PUBLISHED A LOT OF OTHER AGENCIES. THERE'S ALSO AN ISSUE THAT IS A LABOR ISSUE AMONG THE DIFFERENT BARGAINING UNITS OF THE DEPARTMENT. BETWEEN THE STAFF SCIENTISTS. AND SOME OF THE OTHER STAFFERS THAT THERE'S AN INN IN THE INEQUALITY THERE. WHICH AGAIN HAS TO DO WITH BARGAINING UNITS IN OTHER THINGS. AND THAT WE JUST JUST THE MORALE ISSUES BUT. TO ME IT SEEMS THAT IF. IF IF FOLKS. WANT TO COME TO YOU FOR MORE RESOURCES IT YOU GIVE THEM CRITERIA THAT YOU FEEL SATISFIED WITH. THAT ENABLE TO YOU TOO. ASSESS HOW THEY'RE DOING. AND I THINK THAT'S THE DEPARTMENT AS A WHOLE NEEDS MORE OF THAT. THAT WAS A MAJOR FOCUS OF OUR WORK PUTTING. TIVOLI. OBJECTIVE PERFORMANCE METRICS IN PLACE THAT WE THOUGHT MEANT SOMETHING. AND TRYING TO MONITOR THAT THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE'RE NOT LONGER THERE TO MONITOR. AND AGAIN AS YOU ALL KNOW WHAT I KNOW YOUR SCIENTIST. SENATOR QUIRK YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW THE. THE QUALITY YOUR CONCLUSIONS ALSO DEPENDS ON. THE QUALITY OF THE DATA THAT YOU'RE GETTING. AND THAT'S VERY HARD TO MONITOR AS WELL SO THERE'S NO SILVER BULLETS FOR ALL OF THIS BUT WE DO OUR BEST. HE'D LIKE. THERE. YEAH. SO IMPRESSED BECAUSE I REMEMBER WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND AND JUST THE THE THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE NOW AND AN EXPLOITATION. OF IT'S JUST EXTRAORDINARY AND SO HELPFUL. IN IS THE FORMER CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE WHEN ALL OF THIS I THINK STARTED WE. REALLY SAW A LOT OF THE CHALLENGES THAT DTS SHE HAD. AND IN ONE OF THE THE FIRST COMMENT THAT YOU MADE WAS THE. A AND THE RECORD KIND OF OLD. FIRST OBSERVATION WAS THE THE TURNOVER AND THE CHALLENGES THAT THAT BROUGHT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. DID YOU DETERMINE FROM YOUR ANALYSIS OF WHAT YOU SAW ANY PARTICULAR. REASON FOR THAT I GUESS THE CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT THAT MAY WE MAY SEE IF IF THOSE. ISSUES HAVEN'T BEEN DEALT WITH THEIR HAND OR WE MAY SEE THAT GOING FORWARD. YEAH IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU ASK. THEM TO GET TWO OBSERVATIONS WHEN YOU ASK ABOUT YOU KNOW WHY DID THIS PERSON LEAVE FOR THAT PERSON LEAVE. YOU KNOW IT IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY ALWAYS HAS THEIR OWN REASONS YOU KNOW SOMEBODY TOOK A BETTER JOB SOMEBODY HAD. HEALTH ISSUES IN THE FAMILY. YOU KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS SEEM TO BE. BUT A ONE OFF BASIS VERY JUSTIFIABLE REASONS. BUT THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT LOOK AT ALL OF IT. YOU YOU SEE WHEN WE FIRST STARTED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN FOR EXAMPLE. I THINK OF THE TOP. FIFTEEN OR THIRTY LEADERSHIP POSITIONS LIKE THREE OF THEM HAD BEEN THERE FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS.SO I THINK YOU YOU TURN AROUND AND SAY WELL INTO SOMETHING. MORE IMPORTANT DEEPER GOING ON HERE. I THINK THAT'S THE SORT OF SECOND POINT WHICH IS THAT. YOU KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT TO WORK IN A DEPARTMENT. THAT. IS SUBJECT TO A LOT OF THE CRITICISM. WHERE MAYBE THERE IS HIGHER PAY IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR? SO I THINK. OF ALL OF OUR JOBS AND THAT'S WHAT WE FOCUS SO MUCH ON THE HUMAN RESOURCES ASPECT. IS TO MAKE THE DEPARTMENT DATE OF A MORE INVITING PLACE TO WORK TO TRY TO FIND MECHANISMS TO SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT FROM WITHIN. TO TRY TO PRAISE THE DEPARTMENT WHERE IT'S IT'S DOING A GOOD JOB. SO I THINK IT'S IT'S A BALANCE OF THOSE THINGS WE'RE HAPPY TO REPORT THAT TWO AND A HALF YEARS LATER. THERE APPEARS AT LEAST AT THAT LEADERSHIP LEVEL TO BE MORE CONTINUITY. DIRECTOR LEE IS A VERY DIFFICULT JOB. BUT YOU KNOW SHE STUCK IT OUT IT HASN'T BEEN EASY FOR HER AND YOU KNOW I APPLAUD HER FOR THAT. BUT I'M REALLY HOPEFUL AND BUDGETS HAVE TO REFLECT THIS. THAT THIS HR WORK ABOUT INTERNALLY CHAMPIONING THE STAFF. AT DOING EVALUATIONS DOING THE TRAININGS DOING THE SUPPORT. OVER TIME. IT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE CULTURE AT THIS DEPARTMENT THAT'S THE HOPE CENTER HELP. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I'D LIKE TO END BY JUST THANKING YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICE. YOU'VE DONE. YOU MUST OF HAD TWO FULL TIME JOBS. AND. WE KNOW HOW MUCH YOU KNOW YOU'VE WORKED. WE ARE GOING TO CALL UPON YOUR EXPERTISE. HOPE WE ALLOW YOU THOUGH TO GET BACK TO YOUR DAY JOB SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'RE NOW GOING TO START THE PUBLIC COMMENT SECTION. OF THE FIRST PERSON UP FOR COMMENT PUBLIC COMMENT. IS GOING TO BE. LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUPERVISOR HILDA'S LEASE. AND SHE HAS SAYS SOMEONE COMING OUT NEXT TO SOMEONE'S COMING UP WITH THEIR. WILL ASK YOU IF YOU CAN TO KEEP IT TO ABOUT TEN MINUTES. APPROXIMATELY. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW. THE SUPERVISOR WAS SECRETARY OF LABOR CONGRESSWOMAN STATE SENATOR STATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AND FRANKLY THE THE JOB A COUNTY SUPERVISOR IN LOS ANGELES IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT JOBS IN OUR STATE. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HRE TODAY FANS. I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN ANY SUGGESTIONS YOU WHEN YOUR EXPERTS HAVE ABOUT. WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE ON THE? RECEIVING SIDE OF THE DEPARTMENT WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND HOW YOU SEE THE STRUCTURES MIGHT CHANGE. TO MAKE IT EASIER TO WORK FOR THE WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND ANY OTHER. ASPECTS THAT YOU THAT YOU HAVE THANK YOU. WELL THANK YOU OF VERY MUCH I'M VERY HONORED AND PLEASED TO BE HERE CHAIRMEN AJ CAL SKI AND A GERMAN CORK I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME AND SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN. TO YOU. VERY PLAIN. LEE ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE BEEN FACED IN OUR COUNTY AND THAT IS THE. EXIDE FACILITY IN SOMETHING THAT SOME OF YOU I BELIEVE ARE FAMILIAR WITH I HAVE WITH ME TODAY OUR COUNTY STAFF ARE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. WHO'S JOINED ME LOW DOCTOR ANGELO PALOMA AND ALSO OF WE HAVE MISTER DOCTOR ADAM LOVE WHO'S OUR EXPERT WHO'S BEEN WORKING ON THESE ISSUES. SO FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS SINCE I BECAME A SUPERVISOR. THIS CONUNDRUM I LIKE TO SAY. EXIDE. HAS BEEN BUBBLING UP OF FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND UNFORTUNATELY THE WAY THAT I SEE IT IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF. TOXIC EXPENSIVE SINCE CONTROL HAS NOT REALLY. BEEN BEEN AT THE HELM. TO HELP US OF PROVIDE THE APPROPRIATE SUPPORT REMEDIATION BUT ALSO LEADERSHIP AND I REALLY HAVE TO COMMAND OF. THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER WHO PRESENTED HIS REPORT ABOUT THE LACK OF OF LEADERSHIP ACCOUNTABILITY RESPONSIBILITY AND IN PARTICULAR INVOLVEMENT WITH COMMUNITY AND THAT'S REALLY WHY I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT WHY IT'S IMPORTANT. FOR YOU ALL TO UNDERSTAND THAT OUR COMMUNITY HAS BEEN SUFFERING. A NOT JUST IN THREE YEARS BUT A HE DID HAVE A NUMBER OF DECADES THIRTY THREE YEARS BECAUSE OF THE. PERMITTING PROCESS THAT WAS LACKING IN OVERSIGHT ANY LEGAL PERMIT AND THE FACT THAT. THAT FACILITY WAS ALLOWED TO OPERATE. FOR SO MANY YEARS WHEN I CAME IN WE DECIDED WE WERE GOING TO TRY TO ASSIST IN ANY WAY WE COULD TO WORK WITH THE STATE TO WORK WITH OUR LEGISLATORS. AND THE COUNTY'S RESPONSIBILITY TO LOOK AT HEALTH IN TERMS OF WHAT THOSE IMPACTS ARE AND WHAT WHAT WE DID WAS. TRY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND I'M VERY PLEASED I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE GOVERNOR. OF HEARD US AND HEARD OUR VOICES AT LAST YEAR WE ACTUALLY BROUGHT UP. FIFTY RESIDENTS THAT CAME FROM EAST LOS ANGELES AND ACTUALLY WALKED THE HALLS AND TALKED PEOPLE ABOUT. THEIR EXPERIENCE HAVING TO LIVE THROUGH. THE LEAD CONTAMINATION IN PLACE ANYWAY ACTUALLY BROUGHT INDIVIDUALS THAT COULD TESTIFY ABOUT THEIR AILMENTS AS A RESULT OF THE EXPOSURE OVER THE YEARS AND WHAT THAT MEANS. TO THEIR FAMILIES THEIR CHILDREN AND TO. INDIVIDUALS LIVE IN RESIDE IN THE COUNTY. GOVERNOR DID PROVIDE A HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX. DOLLARS FOR THE CLEAN UP EFFORT. BUT AFTER TELL YOU THAT ALL RIGHT NOW IS IT'S DOWN STANDS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION STILL REMAINS IN THAT ACCOUNT WE'VE ONLY SEEN I BELIEVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY I THINK IT'S TWO HUNDRED SIXTY HOMES THAT HAVE ACTUALLY. BEEN. CLEANED OR SOME REMEDIATION HAS HAPPENED. BUT THEY FAIL TO MEET THEIR THEIR OWN DEADLINES AND THEIR OWN. PLANNING SO MANY MANY THINGS THAT YOU HEARD EARLIER I WOULD I WOULD SAY YES WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO STICK TO THEIR PLANS. THEY ABSOLUTELY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY MEET THEIR BUDGET GOALS AS WELL AND IF THEY NEED TO HAVE MORE COOPERATION WITH THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE INVOLVED. THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC ART DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ACTUALLY. WAS VERY COMMITTED TO GETTING RESPONSE FROM OUR COMMUNITY AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID IMMEDIATELY WAS WHAT I LIKE TO SAY PUT BOOTS OUT ON THE GROUND. AND ACTUALLY TOOK A SATURDAY AFTERNOON WITH ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED VOLUNTEERS TO GO DOOR TO DOOR TO TALK TO ACTUAL PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED IN THE RADIUS OF ONE POINT. SEVEN MILES IT WAS DETERMINED BY DEE DEE TSC AND WE STARTED TO TALK TO PEOPLE AND NOT SURPRISING PEOPLE SAID YES WE'VE HEARD ABOUT XIV. WERE UNCLEAR ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING NO ONE'S REALLY TALKED TO US ABOUT THIS AND TOLD US WHAT THE DANGERS ARE WE WE DO KNOW THOUGH THAT WE HAVE HEALTH AILMENTS. WE HAVE CHILDREN WITH ASTHMA WE HAVE CHILDREN WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES WE HAVE PEOPLE ON ONE BLOCK THAT I WALKED WITH STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS. OF. MAYBE SEVEN HOUSEHOLDS WHERE A NEIGHBOR POINTED OUT EACH HOME SAYING. THOSE THAT FAMILY WAS IMPACTED BY CANCER AND AND JUST WENT DOWN THE LINE AND IT WAS VERY SHOCKING. FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO JUST YOU KNOW ANECDOTALLY HEAR THAT FROM NEIGHBORS THAT LIVE THERE AND AND. FELT THAT THERE WAS REALLY A NEGLIGENCE ON THE PART OF THE STATE AND AS WELL AS THE COUNTY BECAUSE THEY BLAME ANYBODY IN GOVERNMENT FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO GET OUT THERE AND RECTIFY THIS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME. WE HAD ANOTHER CURRENTS ANOTHER PART OF THE COUNTY OF THE SO CANYON WHERE YOU SAW AN IMMEDIATE ATTENTION AND FORCE AND. LAWYERS AND ALL EVERYONE WAS PAYING FULL ATTENTION TO THAT INCLUDING THE STATE AND THE GOVERNOR WE DIDN'T SEE THAT WITH EXCITING WE STILL HAVEN'T SEEN IT. WE STILL FEEL THAT. WE HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED IN TERMS OF THE KIND OF OUTREACH AND PERFORMANCE BY DTS SEE A WE DID I BELIEVE A BETTER THE RELATIVELY SHORT. OF PATTERN AND TIME AND ALSO COME BACK WITH RESULTS AND TELL PEOPLE AT WHAT LEVEL THEIR HOUSES WERE IMPACTED BY BY THE LEAD AND ALSO THEN WE'RE ABLE TO DO THAT. THROUGH OUR THROUGH OUR OWN FUNDING WE DID THAT THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF. PUBLIC HEALTH AND YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT BUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU IS THAT. SINCE THE BEGINNING AND I UNDERSTAND AND I HAVE SAT DOWN AND I ACTUALLY MET. BARBARA LEE AND HER STAFF THEY DECIDED TO SET UP A COMMITTEE FOR THE COMMUNITY BUT AT THIS POINT IF YOU WERE TO ASK THOSE COMMITTEE MEMBERS IF THERE'S BEEN ANY STRONG RESULTS ARE ACTION. THINK MANY OF THEM WOULD SAY NO. DID NOTE THAT THEY THEY'RE BEEN NEGLIGENT IN IN ACTUALLY LISTENING TO THEM AND GIVING THEM FEEDBACK AS TO WHAT THE PROGRESS IS AND WHAT THEIR ACTUAL PLAN IS IN AND IF IN FACT THEY STUCK TO THEIR PLAN. SINCE THEY STARTED THE CLEANUP WE HAD TO GO BACK IN BECAUSE OF THE COMMUNITY WANTED THE E. I. ARE DONE THAT ALSO PUSH THIS BACK SO WE'RE NOW OUT SEVERAL MONTHS IN TERMS OF THE CLEAN UP. SINCE THAT TIME I'VE BEEN TOLD THERE HAS BEEN NO FURTHER CLEANUP AND FURTHER MORE WHAT I BELIEVE IS A IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM. IS THAT. WHEN THEY DID. ROLL OUT A PLAN TO SAY THEY WOULD BEGIN A CLEAN UP FADED TALK ABOUT CLEANING INSIDE THE INTERIOR OF THE HOMES OR THE PARKWAY IN FRONT OF THE HOMES WE HAVE. A MATERIALS THAT WE SHARED WITH YOU SO HOW IS HOW IS IT FOR A RESULT PERSON TO BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE CLEANING SOMEONE'S SOIL IN THEIR FRONT YARD. BUT YOU'RE NOT CLEANING THE PARKWAY WHERE YOU GET OFF THE CARTER CAR OFF THE SIDEWALK AND YOU'RE WALKING IN YOUR HOME AND YOUR CHILD OR ANYONE THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO. BRING THAT SAME ELEMENT OR CONTAMINANTS IN YOUR HOME. YOU'RE NOT CLEANING IN MY OPINION THE WAY THAT YOU SUBSTANTIALLY SHOULD. PROCEED IN FACT. IT WAS ALMOST LAUGHABLE THAT DAY US SAID THAT. WERE KNOCKING INSISTED PEOPLE CLEAR CLEAN THEIR INTERIOR BUT WE'LL GIVE YOU A COUPON AND YOU CAN USE ZACH COUPON AND GO AND UP CONTACT THESE PEOPLE AND THEY'LL COME IN AND THEY'LL. VACUUM BUT IT WASN'T THE APPROPRIATE STANDARD OF CLEAN UP THAT I KNOW OUR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WOULD REQUIRE AND AND I I KNOW DOCTOR BELONG OR WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT. BUT THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES WHERE THERE'S BEEN A FAILURE NO ONE EVEN EXPLAIN TO THE RESIDENTS WITH THAT COUPON WAS. IT YOU COULDN'T DIFFERENTIATE WHAT IT WAS YOU WOULD THINK IT WAS JUST AN ADVERTISEMENT IN FACT MANY PEOPLE TOLD ME THEY THREW IT AWAY ONE OFMY STAFFERS. WHO LIVES IN THE AREA ACTUALLY BROUGHT THE COUPON IN AND I THOUGHT WELL THERE'S NOTHING HERE TO DISTINGUISH THAT THIS IS SOMETHING COMING FROM THE STATE OR SOMETHING THAT IS OF URGENCY? SO THAT TO ME. CAUSES ME GREAT CONCERN THAT JUST THE LACK OF RESPECT FOR OUR COMMUNITY FOR EVEN THE STAKE HOLDERS AND THE DIFFERENT. PARTICIPANTS. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET SOMETHING DONE IN A IN THIS IN THIS SHORT PERIOD OF TIME I AM CONCERNED ALSO THAT THE CURRENT BUDGET DOES NOT. ALLOW FOR IT THERE HAS TO BE SOME MOVEMENT OBVIOUSLY BY THE. BUDGET OF SUBCOMMITTEES TO PUT FUNDING AND I GET TO SO WE CAN HAPPEN SO WE CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION SO DETAILS HE COULD CONTINUE. I BEGIN THEIR CLEANUP. THEY HAVE A PLAN OF A I THINK THAT. WE HAVE MANY MANY QUESTIONS. REGARDING AND WOULD HOPE THAT. YOU WILL YOU WILL HEAR OUR PLEASE AND AND WORK WITH US WE DEFINITELY WANT TO SEE MORE FUNDING BECAUSE WE THINK WE CAN DO IT MORE EFFICIENTLY WITH ACCOUNTABILITY WORKING WITH THE TSC. BUT OBVIOUSLY HEARING ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE IF WE'VE ALREADY PROVEN THAT WE CAN PUT BOOTS ON THE GROUND AND START TO DO TESTING AND OTHER THINGS WHY IN THE WORLD. CAN'T THE STATE OR THIS DEPARTMENT GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER. AND THIS ISN'T A CRITICISM ON ON THE GOVERNOR BECAUSE I THINK YOU KNOW HE APPROPRIATELY PLACED SOME FUNDING THERE BUT WE NEED MORE AND. WE'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU THE COUNTY IS AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE IS ONE MEMBER OF THE BOARD I ALSO BROUGHT WITH ME PUT A PETITION SIGNED BY OVER FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE. THAT JUST OVER THE WEEKEND SAID WE'D LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING HAPPEN OKAY. COULD WE HEAR FROM YOUR EXPERT WITNESSES ABOUT TWO MINUTES EACH. OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANGELA GLOBAL DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR HEALTH PROTECTION. BECAUSE THE SUPERVISORS COMMENTS REFLECT WE ARE FOCUSED LIKE A LASER LIGHT ON. THE X. SIDE COMMUNITY AND THE CLEAN UP THAT'S GOING ON THERE. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS BOARD IN THE I. R. THE I. RP. HAD A RESPONSIBILITY LOOK ACROSS THE PROGRAMS WITHIN THE DTS SEE AND COME UP WITH WORK RECOMMENDATIONS. SUPERVISOR ASKED ME TO PUT TOGETHER SOME COMMENTS ON THE RECOMMENDATION I JUST LIKE TO. MAYBE MAKE A WORD OR TWO ABOUT SIX OF THEM. THE FIRST ONE IS THAT. TO BUILD AFFECTED RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE COMMUNITY AND TO REGAIN TRUST BECAUSE ONCE YOU LOSE THAT. WE'RE NO LONGER EFFECTIVE AT DOING OUR JOBS AND I THINK. THAT IS SOMETHING THE DTS SEE ON THEIR STAFF FEEL EVERY TIME THEY GO INTO THE COMMUNITY IT'S REALLY HARD FOR THEM TO CONDUCT THEIR WORK BECAUSE ONCE YOU LOSE THAT TRUST. IT'S JUST THE. A BATTLE. SO I THINK. PUTTING THE EFFORT THERE AS IT IS REFERENCED IN THE I. R. PEACH RECOMMENDATION THAT'S A VITAL WE LIKE ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT. WERE INCLUDED IN MR CRACKLES REPORT. BUT THIS IS ONE THAT WE THINK SHOULD HIGHLIGHT WE NEED TO HIGHLIGHT. ANOTHER ONE IS CLOSE COLLABORATIONS WITH LOCAL REGULATORY PARTNERS. AND PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS WE THINK THAT. EXIDE WE TALK A LOT ABOUT IT BUT IT'S BECAUSE IT'S EMBLEMATIC AND IT'S A REALLY GOOD SYMBOL FOR A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS THAT. WERE REFERENCED BEFORE WE EVEN CAME UP HERE. BECAUSE ALMOST EVERYTHING YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER IT'S A SET SUSTAINABLE FUNDING. HOW DO WE MAINTAIN THOSE FUNDING STREAMS HOW DO WE ADEQUATELY FUND THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENT? THOSE WERE ALL PLAYED OUT IT EXCITE THE REASON WHY THIS BECAME A PUBLICLY FINANCED. OBJECT IS BECAUSE THE FINANCIAL ASSURANCES THAT WERE REQUIRED IN THE LAW WERE NEVER UPDATED FOR EXCITE. THE NEXT OF THE THIRD OF. RECOMMENDATION WAS THE CREATION OF AN OVERSIGHT BOARD AND I WON'T COMMENT ON THAT ANYMORE THAN GIDEON DID. OTHER THAN TO SAY THAT. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY WITHOUT THAT ABILITY OF AN OVERSIGHT BODY. STRENGTHENING THE FINANCIAL FINANCIAL ASSURANCES SO THAT WE DON'T. REALLY UP PUT THESE BURDENS ON STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO FUND THINGS WHERE YOU HAVE AN ACTIVE. OPERATING FACILITY WHO'S WHO'S BRINGING IN REVENUE. AWHILE THEY'RE ACTING BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL SERVICES IN PLACE. AND THEN OF THE FAITH THE A FIFTH. THE FIVE YEAR REVIEWS FOR A LONG TERM SITE CLEANUPS ESSENTIAL RECOMMENDATION. WE REALLY SAW THAT PLAYING OUT IN EXCITED BECAUSE IF THIS CLEAN UP IS NOT IMPLEMENTED. WITH THE NECESSARY CHANGES IT IN THE WAY IT IS IMPLEMENTED. WILL BE REVISITING THIS AGAIN AT SOME POINT AND WE'LL HAVE TO GO BACK TO THOSE SITES. MEN OF THE LAST ONE BEING THE CREATION OF THE STATE WIDE. TASK FORCE ON LEAD THERE IS NO CHEMICAL IN THE WORLD IT IS MORE EXTENSIVELY STUDY THAN LEAD. BUT WE STILL HAVE UP POISONINGS AND EXPOSURES THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE HAVING. AND I THINK THIS IS ONE GOOD STEP WITHIN CALIFORNIA FOR US TO TRY TO. TURN THAT AROUND SOMEWHAT. AND I JUST SIMPLY WANT TO CLOSE BY SAYING THAT. WITHIN THE COUNTY AND SPECIFICALLY WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. WE ARE OPEN TO WORKING WITH YOU AND THE DEPARTMENT OF OF. DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL. IN ANY WAY WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS GET IMPLEMENTED OKAY THANK YOU AND I'M CERTAINLY WILLING TO FACILITATE A MEETING. WITH YOUR DEPARTMENT AND DTS SEATED SEE WHAT MORE CAN BE DONE TOGETHER. SO. PERHAPS WITH THE SENATORS HOW WE CAN DO THAT. YOUR FINAL WITNESS. I THINK FROM A TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE RIGHT OUT OF THE COUNTY IN DETAIL SEE I DON'T NECESSARILY SEE EYE TO EYE NOT ONLY ON SOME OF THE ASSESSMENTS BUT ALSO SOME OF THE STRATEGIES FOR CLEAN UP. AND I THINK UP FROM A TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE PERSPECTIVE REALLY MORE DIALOGUE AND TRANSPARENCY. AS TO THOSE AS YOU KNOW THAT ASSESSMENT PROCESS AND RATIONALE AS WELL AS SOME ASSUMPTIONS ARE USING IN TERMS OF DETERMINING HOW THINGS ARE GOING TO BE CLEANED UP. IS SOMETHING THAT STILL A DIALOGUE THAT WE REALLY WANT TO HAVE BECAUSE WE THINK THERE'S SOME ASSUMPTIONS THAT THEY'RE MAKING THAT DON'T ALLOW THE COMMUNITY ULTIMATELY TO BE CONFIDENT. THAT WHEN THEY'RE DONE THE HOMES WILL BE CLEAN AND SAFE TO RETURN TO. KNOW IT FROM A TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE YOU NEED CAN NEVER HAVE A HUNDRED PERCENT CONFIDENCE BUT WE DO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE BETTER METHODOLOGIES TO EMPLOY THAT WILL GIVE THE COMMUNITY MUCH BETTER CONFIDENCE AND WHAT'S CURRENTLY BEING PROPOSED. THANK YOU. I WILL MENTION SIMPLY MEMBER SEAN THIAGO IS BROUGHT FORWARD A BILL TO PARTICULAR LOOK AT THE PARK. SAID THAT TO A SUPERVISOR A. SILLY SAYS MENTIONED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PUBLIC TESTIMONY. WE WILL BE FOLLOWING UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SO WE'LL CONTINUE PUBLIC TESTIMONY PLEASE TRY TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO ROUGHLY TWO MINUTES. AND GIVE US YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION AND OUT FOR YOU FROM. THE MICROPHONE. HELLO YEAH SO. A MICROPHONE IS RIGHT HERE. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS INGRID ROSTRUM I'M WITH THE CENTER ON RACE POVERTY IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND I'M ALSO AT THE CALIFORNIA BY MISTER JUSTICE ALLIANCE. ON. I WANTED TO START. MY RESPONSE ME I'M JUST HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE HEARING YOU KNOW PERHAPS A BETTER LOOK CLOSE TO THE MICROPHONE AND START YOUR INTRODUCTION AGAIN. MY NAME IS INGRID ROSTRUM I'M WITH THE CENTER ON RACE POVERTY IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND ALSO AT THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE THAT IS MUCH BETTER THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND I DID WANT TO. A QUESTION THAT WAS RAISED IN THE BEGINNING ARM ASKING PUBLIC COMMENTERS VERY QUICKLY TO SAY WHAT HAS IMPROVED AND I WILL SAY. HAVING BEEN VERY INTIMATELY INVOLVED WITH THIS AGENCY FOR. ABOUT A DECADE ON. THAT THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND TRIBAL AFFAIRS. IT IS BEEN VERY OPPRESSIVE TO ME AND WITH GOOD DEDICATED STAFF AND STAFF LEVELS ON WE ALSO BEEN IMPRESSED WITH SOME OF. THE POSITIONS BEING FILLED AT THE HIGHER LEADERSHIP LEVELS AS WELL AS SOME. PEOPLE IN THOSE POSITIONS LEAVING THAT PROBABLY NEEDED TO LIVE AWHILE AGO SO THOSE ARE TWO THINGS THAT I WILL SAY WE HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED WITH. SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE. REALLY ESPECIALLY AFTER THE I RP HAS BEEN DISBANDED IS THIS ISSUE OF WHERE DO. IMPACTED COMMUNITIES IMPACTED RESIDENTS AGO WHEN THESE ISSUES THAT FAILED TO BE RESOLVED YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR. THE I RP WAS THE ONLY. PLACE ARE ONLY BODY OUR PEOPLE COULD RAISE THESE CONCERNS SO THERE IS A BIG CONCERN ABOUT WHAT DO WE DO NOW. THE STATUS QUO HAS NOT WORKED FOR MANY DECADES FOR THESE COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE THIS SAME ISSUE WITH THEM IS DEADLINES ON YES. SP SIX SEVENTY THREE THAT DEADLINE HAS COME AND GONE AND I'M SURPRISINGLY THEY HAVE THEY HAVE FAILED TO MEET THAT. OF HER MEETING WITH THE WITH THE BACKLOG FIBER ATTACK STILL IS ON AN EXPIRED PERMIT THAT EXPIRED IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES. AND EVEN WITH CLEAN UPS. WE HAD IN DELANO WHERE OUR OFFICES WE HAD A CONTAMINATED WITH CONTAMINATION DISCOVERED IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX AND TEN YEARS LATER THE COMMUNITY WAS INFORMED. THAT WE HAVE THIS PATTERN OF LONG DELAYS. INFORMATION GAPS AND COMMUNITIES NOT HAVING ANYWHERE TO TURN. AND THE MOST IMPORTANTLY. WE'RE NOT REALLY IN MY MIND GOING TO. SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT DTS SEE UNLESS WE REALLY TACKLE THE STRUCTURE IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS. IT ISN'T INSULAR. AGENCY BUT YET IT IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AGENCIES IN TERMS OF PUBLIC HEALTH THAT WE HAVE IN THIS STATE. BUT NOW FOR CONTAMINATED SITES OR MEDIATION SITES AND PERMITTING. WE DON'T KNOW WHO'S THE DECISION MAKERS AS A AS A RESIDENCE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT BASIS DECISIONS ARE ON. SET WITH YOUR TWO MINUTES IS UP COULD YOU JUST FINISH UP. YES ARM. THERE'S NO STANDARDIZED. THERE'S NO STANDARDS WHICH WE CAN APPLY AND THE APPEAL PROCESS IS BROKEN SO UNLESS WE REALLY DEAL WITH THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES AT DTS SEE I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO RESOLVE THINGS AND THIS AD HOC WAY SO WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE IRAQIS RECOMMENDATIONS. ESPECIALLY ON THE STRUCTURAL REFORMS THINK OKAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR VERY VALUABLE TESTIMONY. OUR NEXT SPEAKER. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS ANDREA VENTURA I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF CLEAN WATER ACTION. AND WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH PTSD SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS REGULATORY PROCESS. AND THERE IS ONE THING IT WASN'T REALLY DISCUSSED HERE IN THE TESTIMONY BUT THERE IS ONE THING IN THE REPORT THAT WE DO. HAVE A BIT OF. CONCERNED ABOUT AND THAT IS A RECOMMENDATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE PULL BACK AND NOT REALLY ACT ON CHEMICALS OR AT LEAST INTERFERE WITH THAT PROGRAM. THAT CAME UP DURING THE HEARING BY INDUSTRY INTERESTS. BECAUSE THERE WAS LEGISLATION TO PUT THINGS INTO THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS RAKES THE REASON WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT IS THAT WE'RE KIND OF FEELING STUCK IN CALIFORNIA WERE BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE AT THIS POINT. ON CHEMICAL POLICY REFORM. THIS IF A CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM WHICH WE TOTALLY SUPPORT THE CONCEPT THE INNOVATION AND THE STAFF WORKING ON IT. ARM THE REALITY IS HOWEVER THAT THAT IS A TEN YEAR PROGRAM THAT HAS NOT PRODUCED A SINGLE ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS YET. IT IS PARTIALLY A RESOURCE ISSUE AND GETTING STARTED AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS. BUT IT IS ALSO A PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN TIMID IN USING ITS OWN AUTHORITY TO MOVE FORWARD. IN OUR OPINION. AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE COME TO THE LEGISLATURE AND WITH SUPPORT FROM. FROM BOTH OF THE YOUR COMMITTEES. HAVE MOVE SOME LEGISLATION ON CHEMICAL POLICY. BUT WHAT I WANT TO JUST BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION IS THAT WE HEAR FROM DTS SEE AND FROM AND FROM CAL EPA IS. DON'T MESS WITH MR OUR PROGRAM ITS SCIENTIFIC. AND WE AGREE WITH IT IN A PERFECT WORLD THAT THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE. BUT IT IS A DELIBERATIVE PROCESS IT WILL ALWAYS BE SLOW AND IT WAS NEVER MEANT TO ABROGATE THE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LEGISLATURE TO AT TIMES TO TAKE. ACTION ON CHEMICALS THAT ARE CAUSING SERIOUS EXPOSURES TO CALIFORNIANS AND. NEED TO BE ERADICATED SO WE JUST WAIT BECAUSE WE HEAR FROM THE LEGISLATURE WE'VE GOT SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS WE HEAR FROM SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS. DON'T MESS WITH US. AND NOTHING'S HAPPENING OKAY OKAY YOU VERY MUCH FRANK YOU RELEVANT TESTIMONY. LEO ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP A FIRST I AGREE WITH MANY OF THE COMMENTS THAT. MISPRINTS FROM MADE FROM CRP ABOUT STRUCTURAL REFORM NEEDED TO TSC. BUT I MAINLY WANT TO STICK TO THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM AGREEING WITH THAT MS CENTER OF THAT IT'S MOVING WAY TOO SLOWLY. WAY LONGER THAN THE LEGISLATURE CERTAINLY INTENDED WHEN IT WAS PASSED. CERTAINLY MORE RESOURCES ARE NEEDED. BUT WE WOULD DISAGREE WITH ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATION OR A COMMENT MADE BY THE R. P. WHICH IS MAYBE THEY SET UNREALISTIC DEADLINES AND THEY SHOULD SET. BEING A MORE REALISTIC AND SET ABOUT I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE WE'RE GOING SLOW SLOWLY NOW. LET'S GET IT DONE FASTER LASTLY ON THE ISSUE OF THE LEGISLATURE TAKING. ACTION IN LIEU OF OR INSTEAD OF IT'S PERFECTLY ALLOWABLE THE LAW NEVER SAYS THIS WILL BE THE SOLE PREROGATIVE OF THE. GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM TO DO THAT AND AS WE MOVE INTO THE NEXT DECADE OF THE PROGRAM I THINK THE LEGISLATURE OUGHT TO LOOK AT. SINGLE CHEMICAL BAND BILLS WERE A A DIRTY WORD AFTER AWHILE BUT SOMETIMES THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH SOONER THAN DTS HE IS ABLE TO UNTIL IT'S FULLY STAFFED UP OR WHATEVER YOU DO THEY GET TO SO IT'S. MORE RAPID AND PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU TOM JACOB. AFTER THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA. I JUST LIKE TO COMMENT A LITTLE BIT. AS THE TWO PREVIOUS SPEAKERS HAVE. ON ELEMENTS OF. DTS THESE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE SENT CENTRALLY AT ISSUE IN TERMS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE AND CLEAN UPS AND THAT'S. THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM AND ALSO. THE POLLUTION PREVENTION PROGRAM WHICH. GIDEON HAD REFERENCED IN HIS TESTIMONY. THAT. DISAPPEARED. WE'VE SUPPORTED BOTH OF THOSE PROGRAMS. WE DIFFER WITH THE PREVIOUS TWO SPEAKERS IN TERMS OF. THE PACE OF THE STP THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM. IT HAS BEEN DELIBERATE IT'S BEEN FRUSTRATING. WE DO THINK THAT SOME OF THAT IS. RELATED TO. MANPOWER QUESTIONS. SOME OF IT QUITE FRANKLY THOUGH IS RELATED TO THE FACT THAT. THAT WAS A PIONEERING. REGULATION THE STATUTES WERE NEW TRAILS HERE. COVERING NEW GROUND FROM A REGULATORY STANDPOINT. AND WE THINK IT'S BEEN AN APPROPRIATELY DELIBERATE. PROCESS. I ALSO BELIEVE AND I THINK THIS IS A COMMONLY. SHARED BELIEF. THAT THEY'RE POISED TO MOVE MUCH MORE RAPIDLY. NOW THAT THEY'VE GOT THEIR. INITIAL SEVERAL. PRODUCTS. MOVING AND THEY'VE HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF THAT PROCESS. I'D LIKE TO ALSO. MENTION RELATED CONCERN NOW AND THAT IS. THAT AS WE ATTEND TO THE PROBLEMS WHICH WE CERTAINLY DON'T DISPUTE. THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED HERE TODAY I THINK WE CAN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT DTS HE HAS A LARGER SUITE OF. RESPONSIBILITIES AND. THOSE. DO NEED TO BE TAKEN. INTO COGNIZANCE AS WE CONSIDER. HOW TO REMEDY THE PROBLEMS WE WOULD NOT WANT TO SEE? RADICAL STEPS TAKEN. THAT ARE DRIVEN. LARGELY BY A HANDFUL OF SITES WHERE WE HAVE. ISSUES. THAT WOULD. MAKE CHANGES THAT WOULD UNDERMINE THE INTEGRITY OF THE LARGER SUITE OF ACTIVITY THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR. VERY. APROPOS TESTIMONY. REALLY APPRECIATE IT AND. HAVING HEARD THREE OF YOU NOW SPEAKING TO THAT PROGRAM WE COULD CERTAINLY. I'LL BE TAKING THAT FURTHER LOOK AT IT. TOP PERHAPS WITH MY COLLEAGUE HERE. YES. GO AHEAD RANDALL FRIEDMAN ON BEHALF OF NAVY REGION SOUTHWEST WHICH OPERATES FOR HAZARDOUS WASTE PERMITS ESSENTIAL TO OUR MISSION. I'D ALSO POINT OUT THE EAR FORCE OPERATES THREE HOUSE RACE FACILITIES MAKING THE MILITARY A MAJOR STAKEHOLDER IN THE PERMITTING ISSUES. I'D LIKE TO RECOGNIZE THE HARD WORK AND THOUGHT THAT WENT INTO THE I RP AND THE LEADERSHIP OF CHAIRMAN CRACK OFF. THE FINAL REPORT RECOGNIZES A SERIOUS ISSUE THE MILITARY BROUGHT TO THEM. AND WE APPRECIATE THE RECOMMENDATION. THAT APPLICANTS BE GIVEN QUOTE A REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF COSTS AND THAT A MECHANISM BE DEVELOPED. TO HOLD THE TSC ACCOUNTABLE FOR THOSE ASSURANCES. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU THIS YEAR ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS IN A BASKET SOME YOUNG BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ARMS JUSTICE ALLIANCE AND I JUST WANNA FINISH APPALLING OR NEAR THE MARMOSET DOES THIS ALLIANCE AND I JUST WANT TO FINISH THE POINT ON FROM THE FIRST SPEAKER. IN A REALLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR A COUPLE YEARS AND SPECIFICALLY OF COMMUNITIES WHO ARE SEEING THESE FACILITIES NOT BE REGULATED HOW THEY SHOULD BE REGULATED BY THIS DEPARTMENT. I REALLY COMMAND ARE PEOPLE PROCESSES AND COME IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS EVER SEEN BUT WHAT WE WANT TO SEE ITS IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. THERE'S A LOT OF RECOMMENDATIONS ARE REALLY. SUBSTANTIAL HOWEVER WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF THEM NOT BE IMPLEMENTED OR HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY FIND IT TO BE IMPLEMENTED TO REALLY CONSIDERING THOSE. DIFFERENT ELEMENTS ALSO I'M REALLY COMMEND SURPRISED HER PHILLIES FOR COMNG OUT I'M IN REALLY SPEAKING ON THIS ISSUE GIVEN THE WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING IN THE COMMUNITY OF THE SILLY WITH EXIDE BUT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THESE INCIDENTS ARE NOT ISOLATED TO SPECIFICALLY. LA BUT LOOKING AT THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF HOW MANY MORE INCIDENTS AND NOT BE REPORTED AND DON'T HAVE SOMEBODY LIKE SUPERVISED RELEASE TO BE HERE. TO REALLY ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THEM SO WITHOUT REALLY BE MINDFUL THAT THIS IS NOT JUST IN SELLING CALIFORNIA BITS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND HOW DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL. REFORM THAT CAN ACTUALLY SERVE ALL CALIFORNIANS SO THANK YOU FOR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR EXCELLENT TESTIMONY. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK. TOM I WILL GET THIS OVER TO THE SENATE. WE'RE DONE WE'RE GAVEL WE'RE DONE. WHERE DO I GET THIS? YEAR. WE'RE DONE THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH
