OPENING REMARKS. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR A MADAM CHAIR -- YEAH I'M JUST VERY DELIGHTED TO BE AT THIS JOINT HEARING WITH THE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE IN THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON FOSTER CARE. OF TO LOOK AT HOW THE SYSTEM IS WORKING -- SOMEBODY REMARKED UPON THIS BUTTON FOSTER CARE DOES INDEED MATTER. AND THE EFFORT TO USE THE TOOLS IN THE PUBLIC POLICY TOOL KIT. OF PUBLIC POLICY AND RESOURCES. AND REALLY FOCUS. ON ON THESE KIDS THEIR CARE GIVERS TO TRY. TO STRENGTHEN THE STABILITY. THAT THEY NEED TO DEAL WITH THE TRAUMA THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HAVE BEEN ADVERSE IN THEIR LIFE. TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO SUPPORT THE CARE GIVERS. WHO PROVIDE THAT VERY VITAL STABILITY? THE CAN HELP THEY MOVE THROUGH THE ADVERSITIES OF THEIR LIFE AND GROW TOWARDS PRODUCTIVE CITIZENSHIP -- I THINK THAT THE SERVICES ARE VERY IMPORTANT BOTH FOR THE NEEDS THEY MEET. BUT ALSO AS A AS AN INDICATOR THAT WHATEVER ADVERSITY SAVE ENCOUNTERED. IT CONVEYS A SENSE OF THEY ARE VALUED. THAT THERE RESPECTED. WE'RE LOOKING DO A PULL THEM IN THEIR DIGNITY IS INDIVIDUALS. I THINK THAT'S THE HIGHER ASPIRATION OF THIS FIELD AND IT IS A VERY COMPLICATED FIELD. I APPRECIATE THE WORK OF LA ILL -- AND THE BACKGROUND WORK OF DAFT IN THE TEAM THE COMMITTEE TO JUST KIND OF HIGHLIGHT. THE DIFFERENT. PARTIES IN THE PROCESS OF DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS A RELATIONSHIP A STATE AND FEDERAL LAW. TO DIFFERENT RULES OF ELIGIBLE IS THAT APPLY TO CHILDREN GENERALLY FOSTER USE THOSE WITH TRAUMA. ADULTS SOME OF THEM MEDI CAL SYSTEM. ON HOW ALL THIS DIFFERENTIATES THE NEED TO PARTNER STATE AND COUNTIES. AND MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES ROLE DSS. THE PURPOSE OF TODAY'S HEARING IS JUST TO REALLY TO EDUCATE. THE MEMBERS. TO UNDERSTAND MORE DEEPLY ALL THIS COMPLEXITY. BUT ALWAYS WITH A VIEW TO KIDS WE SUPPORT THEM. AND PERSONALLY I WILL SAY I DO FIND THIS COMPLEXITY MIND BOGGLING. AND THAT'S SOMETHING COMING FROM A LAWYER. THAT I WOULD FIND IT MIND BOGGLING BUT I DO FIND IT MIND BOGGLING. WHAT I KNOW ABOUT EXPERTISE? IN GENERAL IN ANY HUMAN ENDEAVOR PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERTS CAN LOOK AT THAT COMPLEXITY. AND SEE THE SIMPLICITY THE LIES WITHIN. AND SO REALLY AS I SIT HERE TODAY I'M JUST LOOKING TO LEARN. LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM OUR EXPERTS SO THAT THEY CAN KIND OF HELP ME LOOK PAST THE COMPLEX IS JUST TRYING TO SEE WHAT MATTERS. WHAT'S THE SIMPLEST ALLIES WITHIN SO THAT WE CAN THINK ABOUT THE TOOLS AND LEGISLATIVE TOOL KIT. ARE. NOT JUST IN OUR OWN LET'S SAVE. FOCUSED AREAS BUT REALLY AS WE LOOK TO A NEW GOVERNOR. TO KIND OF BE AN INTEGRATED LEGISLATURE WHOSE. KAREN FOR THIS STANDARD IS A CHAMPION. AND REALLY TO SET THE AGENDA THE NEXT GOVERNOR ON WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IN THIS IMPORTANT AREA SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR DOCTOR ARAMBULA. THANK YOU BOTH CO CHAIRS AND IF YOU WILL ALLOW INDULGE ME I WANTED TO SAY A SPECIAL THANK YOU -- TODAY ACTUALLY HAPPENS TO BE MY LEGISLATIVE DIRECTORS BIRTHDAY AND SHE'S HERE AND THE BACK SO IF -- AND SHE HAS BEEN A CHAMPION IN THIS AREA FOR A LONG TIME AND MARLA COHEN IT'S QUITE APPRECIATIVE OF HAVE YOU CAN. AND YET HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BIRTHDAYS AND HOW MANY OF OUR FOSTER KIDS DON'T PROPERLY CELEBRATE EACH YEAR. AND HOW OFTEN DO THEY GO LACKING AND WITHOUT AND HOW MUCH PROMINENT DIVERSITY DO THEY FACE. I'M EXCITED TO HEAR FROM EXPERTS IN THE FIELD ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO BETTER. IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A PUBLIC SERVANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING A GOOD PRODUCT. AND THAT OUR FOSTER CARE SYSTEM WORKS OUR COMMUNITIES AND THAT WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATE CRISIS INTERVENTION BUILT WITHIN IT. I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE SEEN A FEW MORE BILLS SIGNED THIS YEAR THAT DEALT WITH THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. PARTICULARLY ONE LOOKING AT AN URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE ANSWERING CALLS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. HAVING BEEN ANY OUR DOCTOR MYSELF I KNOW THAT PROBLEMS DON'T ALWAYS OCCUR FROM -- NINE TO FIVE AND IT'S NOT MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY ANDAND YET IF IT'S A CRISIS FOR YOUR CHILD -- AND YOU'RE A FOSTER PARENT. ARE WE PROVIDING ENOUGH SERVICES TO THEM AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION THAT WE HAVE TODAY ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO BETTER. AND HOW WE CONTINUE TO STRIVE WITH THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION THANK YOU FOR THAT CULTURES. THANK YOU AND THIS IS MY THE END ALMOST OF MY SECOND YEAR HERE AND THE COMPLEXITIES THAT -- MISTER COOLIES TALKING ABOUT ARE MIND BOGGLING -- I THINK THAT IN MANY MANY HEARINGS AND SPECIALLY AND HEALTH AND SOMEONE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SOMEONE COMMITTEE -- THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT YOU KNOW JUST DIFFERENT AREAS THAT WE ARE ENGAGED IN. AND SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE THE ESSENCE OF WHY WE'RE HERE IS LOST THE HUMAN FACTOR -- I'VE SAID IT IN SEVERAL COMMITTEES -- WITH DOCTOR ARAMBULA WE I FEEL THAT A LOT OF TIMES WE HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS BUDGET. LINE ITEM AND THAT BUDGET LINE ITEM -- BUT THE IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THERE'S IN HUMAN CONNECTION TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND THE LACK OF HUMAN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT. FOSTER KIDS THE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR CqC OUR SOCIETY ARE. QUITE FRANKLY RESPONSIBLE I THINK THAT. WE ALL TRY TO BE ENGAGED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO STOP TALKING ABOUT. CHILDREN IN FOSTER KIDS AND YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING AS A LINE ITEM IN THE BUDGET. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT A LINE ITEMS ARE IMPORTANT BUT THE WAY WE HAVE THE DISCUSSIONS CAMP BE. THIS IS MONEY THEREFORE WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS. HAS TO BE THIS IS THE WAY THAT WE CAN GO BOOKS HELP. TO SUPPORT THESE KIDS THAT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE KIDS IN OUR SYSTEM THEY'RE GOING TO BE ADULTS. AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE EITHER FUNCTIONING WELL FUNCTIONING. MEMBERS OF SOCIETY OR NOT AND I THINK THAT'S LOST SOMETIMES IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS THAT. WE CAN SAY THAT WE WANT TO HELP BUT IF WE DON'T PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS BUT YET HAVE THAT HEART. FOR THESE KIDS THEY'RE GOING TO BE ADULTS WITH ISSUES. BECAUSE WE DIDN'T DO WHAT WAS RIGHT ARE BUY THEM AND I'M ALSO VERY APPRECIATIVE OF YOU BEING HERE TODAY AND I WANT TO LEARN MORE. YOU KNOW IN OUR OWN WAY WE ALL GET THE INFORMATION BUT IT'S DIFFERENT DIFFERENT TO SEE IT. THROUGH YOUR EYES BECAUSE YOU'RE ON THE GROUND DAY IN AND DAY OUT AND DOCTOR ARAMBULA WHEN HE WAS AND IN. AN ER DOCTOR I WAS A TEACHER WE SAW THOSE ISSUES MANIFEST THEMSELVES IN EITHER THE EMERGENCY ROOM OR IN THE CLASSROOM. BY WE FELT AT LEAST I DID AS A TEACHER THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THAT I CAN DO. YOU KNOW IS JUST SOMEBODY WAS DIRECTING ME AND TELLING ME WHAT I SHOULD DO WITH THAT THOSE KIDS. AND I IF I HATE THE TERM THOSE KIDS BECAUSE THOSE ARE OUR KIDS AND SO AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN HAVE A PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION. AND IT'S JUST THE FIRST STEP YOU KNOW BY NO MEANS ARE WE GOING TO SOLVE ALL OF THE ISSUES HERE -- BUT I WANT TO KNOW THE BASICS THE ONE THE ONE ABOUT FOSTER KIDS AND HOPEFULLY ALL OF US THAT ARE AFTER THIS LITTLE THING CALLED THE ELECTION IN A COUPLE WEEKS WE CAN REALLY SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT. SOLUTIONS OR POSSIBLE LEGISLATION INTRODUCED TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE WORK THAT YOU DO SO THANK YOU AGAIN ON WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO BRING OUR FIRST PANELISTS. UP WE HAVE -- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS FOR FAST YOU AND WE HAVE CUT THE COMPANY NANA CATHOLIC FOR ANY CLASSES THAT. I GOT THAT IN A CABIN MSW STUDENT AT UC BERKELEY AND WE HAVE WENDY SMITH PH T. L. C. S. W. DISTINGUISHED CONTINUING SCHOLAR IN CHILD WELFARE. UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SESENTA DORK PICK SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WORK. IT IS BUT I'M I'M GLAD TO DO IT SO THANK YOU AND WELCOME WELCOME. THAT AFTERNOON SO AS YOU SAID MY NAME IS KATHERINE I CAME BACK I'M FROM OAKLAND CALIFORNIA. I'M ALSO A FORMER FOSTER YOUTH AND I'M CURRENTLY A COUPLE MONTHS AWAY FROM MY MSW AT UC BERKELEY RAM SPECIALIZING IN CHILD WELFARE SERVICES. I ALSO AM A PART OF CALIFORNIA YOUTH CONNECTION ARE SEE WHY SEE A REALLY AMAZING AND INCREDIBLE YOUTH ORGANIZATION THAT JUST PASSED A BILL THIS YEAR AROUND STABILITY. AB TWENTY TWO FORTY SEVEN AND I BRING THIS UP BECAUSE I THINK THE CONCEPT OF STABILITY IS CRITICAL HERE FOR TALKING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. AND IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE VERY FOUNDATION OF YOUTH BEING SHAKEN AND TORN FROM UNDERNEATH US AND EVERY MOMENT OF OUR TIME IN FOSTER CARE. IT'S HARD TO HAVE ANY. ANYTHING ELSE BEYOND THAT AND WE REALLY NEED STABILITY THAT'S FOUNDATIONAL AND WITH THE FOSTER STABILITY CAMPAIGN WE TALK ABOUT STABILITY IN ALL ASPECTS IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT PLACEMENT WHICH WE ACTUALLY CALL A PLACE TO LIVE BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT BADS. RATE OR A ROOF IT'S REALLY ABOUT A SAFE PLACE TO CALL HOME AND THAT ALL YOUTH DESERVE THAT. SO WE ALSO TALK ABOUT STABILITY IN SERVICE SAYS AND THAT'S A LITTLE BIT WHAT I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU IN MY STORY TODAY. ACTUALLY WENT THREE THIRTY TWO DIFFERENT PLACEMENTS IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM I WAS ALSO IN JUVENILE HALL SEVERAL TIMES AND I WAS ALSO HOSPITALIZED SEVERAL TIMES. I BROUGHT AN IMAGE TODAY THAT I MADE WHILE REFLECTING ON MY EXPERIENCE AND I I WROTE A MANTRA IT SAYS I AM POWERFUL I AM CAPABLE I AM WORTHY IT'S THE SYSTEM THAT'S BROKEN. AND ON HERE I ALSO WROTE ALL THE DIAGNOSES SAM AND ALL THE MEDICATIONS THAT I WAS OFTENTIMES FORCED TO TAKE PARTICULARLY IN GROUP HOMES. AND WHILE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF LEGISLATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS PARTICULARLY DUE TO THE BRAVERY ADVOCACY OF OTHER FOSTER YOUTH WHO COME BEFORE ME. I KNOW WORKING WITHIN THE SYSTEM MYSELF THAT FOSTER YOUTH STILL SUFFER AND THAT. THIS LEGISLATION IS AND ALWAYS AND FORCED. SO IT REALLY WAS NOT HELPFUL FOR ME GROWING UP I THINK WAS THAT. MENTAL HEALTH WAS MORE ABOUT OBLIGATION AND THAT WAS WHAT I WAS REQUIRED TO DO IT WAS ABOUT GETTING PUNISHED IF YOU DIDN'T GO TO THERAPY OR GETTING PUNISHED IF YOU DIDN'T TAKE YOUR MEDICATION SO I WAS NEVER GIVEN A STRONG SENSE OF WHAT HEALTH AND WELLNESS MET. AND THAT I WAS ENTITLED TO A HEALTHY AND SAFE LIFE AND HEALTHY AND SAFE RELATIONSHIPS SO I FOUND THAT ELSEWHERE OFTENTIMES ON THE STREETS WHEN I A WILD AND THEN AGAIN WAS PUNISHED FOR THAT. AND I WOULD CHALLENGE YOU ALL TO DO WHEN THINKING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. IS TO SHIFT SERVICE SAYS AND TARGET THINGS AT THE ADULTS WERE FAILING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF YOUTH. BECAUSE IT CAN BE EASY TO PROBLEM AT HIGHS AND CRIMINALIZE YOUNG PEOPLE FOR BEHAVIORS THAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND. BUT I CHALLENGE YOU TO TAKE TIME TO UNDERSTAND THOSE BEHAVIOR AND PUT YOURSELF IN A POSITION WHERE YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT. NO IDEA IF YOU'RE GOING TO SEE YOUR FAMILY AGAIN. NO IDEA IF YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL AND NO IDEA REALLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE. LET'S TARGET THE SERVICES INSTEAD AT THE ADULTS WHO ARE FAILING TO RESPOND CORRECTLY TO THESE BEHAVIORS WE NEED TO TRAIN CARE GIVERS ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS NOT JUST TO BE TRAUMA AND FORMS BUT TO CREATE SPACE AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO HEAL AND THEIR CARE. WE NEED TO PROVIDE RESOURCES AND COMMUNITIES. CHILDREN TO ENTER FOSTER CARE THROUGH FAULT OF THEIR OWN IT'S OFTENTIMES BECAUSE OF FAILURES OF ADULTS AND OFTENTIMES BECAUSE OF FAILURES OF SYSTEMS WE KNOW THERE'S ENTIRE ZIP CODES I READ ABOUT AS ZIP CODE IN LONG BEACH WHERE ALMOST 90% OF THE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN REMOVED. THAT'S A SYSTEM PROBLEM AND INSTEAD WE TARGET SERVICES TO CHILDREN AND PROBLEM AT HIGHS THEM FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR WHICH IS THE MOST REALISTIC RESPONSE TO WHAT'S HAPPENING. WHEN WE SEE BEHAVIORS THAT WE SOMETIMES LABEL AS OUTBURSTS A REALLY CONCERNS ME BECAUSE FOSTER YOUTH SOMETIMES ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO I THINK ARE RESPONDING CORRECTLY TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE AROUND THAT? THIS IS A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND FOSTER YOUTH ARE TRYING TO TELL US THAT AND I KNOW I WAS. THROUGHOUT MY TIME IN CARE. I WAS ANGRY AND I ONE WAS WILLING TO LISTEN TO ME OR TO HEAR THAT. SO I DID OUT SO I HAD OUT FIRST -- I A WILD AND THEN I WAS PUNISHED FOR THAT BEHAVIOR. AND THEN I WAS MEDICATED FOR THAT BEHAVIOR AND WHAT I DIDN'T TAKE THE MEDICATION I WAS PUNISHED MORE. AND I FELT VERY LOST AND I'M FINE TODAY RIGHT I'M IN GRADUATE SCHOOL AND I DON'T THINK THAT. THAT'S NOT THROUGH JUST MY OWN WORK AND THAT'S NOT BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING INHERENTLY SPECIAL ABOUT ME IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING INHERENTLY SPECIAL ABOUT EVERY SINGLE FOSTER YOUTH. WHO LIVES IN CALIFORNIA AND YOU REALIZE ON ALL OF YOU TO REALLY DO YOUR JOB AND SUPPORT THEM? BETTER THAN WE ARE NOW. I REALLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE SOME SORT OF PROCESS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY PARTICULARLY AROUND PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION. WHICH I STILL SEE TO BE OVER PRESCRIBED PARTICULARLY IN CERTAIN COUNTIES AND I WANT THOSE COUNTIES TO BE HELD FINANCIALLY ACCOUNTABLE. I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT IT'S NOT OKAY TO IGNORE IN JOKE ABOUT THE LEGISLATION THAT THE STATE PASSED IN ORDER TO PROTECT CHILDREN. I WANT YOU THE VOICE AND CHOICE TO BE A PART OF EVERY PROCESS. BECAUSE LEGISLATION WILL MEAN NOTHING FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN CARE UNLESS IT COMES FROM THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN CARE. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY FIND MEANINGFUL WE MADE LOOK FROM THE OUTSIDE AND THINK THAT'S WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE BUT THERE MAY BE A ROOT CAUSE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE I UNDERSTAND BETTER THAN WE DO WHEN WE GET FURTHER REMOVED FROM AT SO REALLY WHAT I WANT TO ASK YOU. ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND FOSTER YOUTH IS TO MAKE STABILITY -- REALITY FOR CALIFORNIA'S FOSTER YOUTH SO THAT YOUTH CAN GROW. AND LEARN AND DREAM. JUST AS OTHER CHILDREN BECAUSE AS YOU. SAID EARLIER THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS SOMEBODY ELSE'S KIDS THESE ARE ALL OF OUR CHILDREN AND I KNOW VERY PERSONALLY HOW MUCH IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY. BUT I ALSO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE DO NOT ACT SO THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. UP I'M WENDY SMITH -- AND I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU ESPECIALLY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND CHAIRS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. AND I WANT TO THANK CUT ENOUGH. FOR SO MANY THINGS SHE SAID WHICH I WOULD HAVE LIKE TO SAY AND COULDN'T FIT INTO. MY DISCUSSION AND PROBABLY COULDN'T OF SAID AS WELL IN ANY CASE SO THANK YOU -- I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO ADDRESS A LENGTHY LIST OF TOPICS IN THE INTERESTS OF PART OF THE ONE A ONE I WILL NEVER GET TO THE MALL. AND SO I SENT YOU SOME SLIDES THAT COVER SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SPEAK ABOUT. UP I WANT TO SAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE RELATIVE TO FOSTER CARE AND THE REASONS WHY I THINK I WAS ASKED. TO COME AND TALK WITH YOU -- AS A PROFESSOR OF SOCIAL WORK AT USC I TAUGHT CLASSES IN CHILD AND ADOLESCENT DEVELOPMENT AND TREATMENT. AND DESIGNED A COURSE ON SOCIAL WORK PRACTICE WITH YOUTH LEAVING CARE. I WROTE THE BOOK THAT BECAME THE TAXED FOR THAT COURSE AND I'VE LEFT A COPY WITH YOU FOR YOUR USE -- AS I SPENT THIRTY FIVE YEARS DOING PSYCHOTHERAPY IN PRIVATE PRACTICE WHERE. A NUMBER OF MY CLIENTS WE'RE FORMER FOSTER YOUTH AND OTHERS INCLUDING THAT OF THOSE PEOPLE WERE SURVIVORS OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE AND CHILD PHYSICAL ABUSE -- I'VE WORKED WITH FOSTER USE SERVING COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS HELPING TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A RELATIONSHIP BASED. TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM. AND CURRENTLY I CHAIR THE LA COUNTY COMMISSION FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND ALSO SERVED. ON THE FIRST FIVE LA COMMISSION THAT ADDRESSES ISSUES FOR VERY YOUNG CHILDREN. SOAK SOME OF THE KEY CONCEPTS THAT I HOPE YOU'LL KEEP IN MIND AS YOU THINK ABOUT. OF FOSTER CHILDREN IN FOSTER YOUTH AND WHAT YOU MIGHT. DO TO IMPROVE THEIR SITUATIONS. OUR EARLY OCCURRING TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES. AND DISRUPTION OF SIGNIFICANT ATTACHMENTS AND THE IMPACTS OF BOTH OF THOSE HAVE ON THE DEVELOPING BRAIN AND THE DEVELOPING CHILD. AND I THINK THEY ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT CUTTING INTO. ADDRESSED. OF CHILDREN WHO ENTER CARE HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCED SOME KIND OF TRAUMA WHETHER IT'S NEGLECT ABUSE. SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR MENTAL ILLNESS OF APPARENT INCARCERATION OF APPARENT. ILLNESS OR DEATH OF A PARENT SO. FOR THEM THEM TO EXPERIENCE REMOVAL FROM HOME IS ANOTHER SERIES OF LOSSES INFORMATIK EVENTS INCLUDING FURTHER DISRUPTION OF WHICHEVER IMPORTANT ATTACHMENTS EXIST FOR THEM. SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT IT IS THROUGH ATTACHMENT EXPERIENCES RELATIONSHIP EXPERIENCES THAT WE DEVELOP THE ABILITY TO MANAGE POWERFUL EMOTIONS THAT'S KIND OF WHERE IT GETS LAID DOWN AND IF WE DON'T LEARN IT WHEN WERE LITTLE WE HAVE TO LEARN IT LATER -- FROM MATIC EARLY EXPERIENCES HAVE PROFOUND EFFECTS ON NEUROBIOLOGY. IN THE SENSE THAT THEY ORIENT. THE CHILD TO DEAL WITH STRESSFUL ENVIRONMENTS AS OPPOSED TO POSITIVE ENVIRONMENTS. AND THIS HAPPENS MOST POWERFULLY IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF LIFE WHEN. 90% OF BRAIN DEVELOPMENT TAKES PLACE. THERE'S A SECOND PERIOD OF IMPORTANT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT DURING ADOLESCENCE AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY. THE USE AND OVER USES PSYCHOTROPIC MADS IS A SPECIALLY -- AT SIRIUS FOR US. TO BE THINKING ABOUT SINCE THE BRAIN IS IN ITS SECOND IMPORTANT PERIOD OF GROWTH. AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW THESE MEDICATIONS ULTIMATELY REALLY AFFECT PEOPLE -- EARLY LIFE STRESS PREDISPOSE CHILDREN TO BEHAVIORAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL PROBLEMS THAT CAN BE LIFELONG. AND THE GREATER THE EXPOSURE TO MALTREATMENT AND TRAUMATIC EVENTS THE GREATER THE LIKELIHOOD THAT CHILDREN WILL STRUGGLE. WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. BUT IT A SECOND POWERFUL INFLUENCE ON MENTAL HEALTH IS STABILITY STABILITY OF PLACEMENT STABILITY OF RELATIONSHIPS. ONE THIRD OF YOUTH IN CARE EXPERIENCE THREE OR MORE PLACEMENTS AND SOME STUDIES REPORT. THAT ONE THIRD EXPERIENCED EIGHT OF MORE. JUST TO GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF KIND OF PREVALENT SINCE THAT WAS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS YOU POSED. YOUTH ARE. OF FOUND TO BE IN THE CLINICAL RANGE FOR BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS AND PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. NOW AS KATERINA POINTED OUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY'RE NOT SITUATIONALLY. YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT RESPONDING TO THE CITY AS OPPOSED TO HAVING SOMETHING BASICALLYWRONG WITH THEM BUT IN TERMS OF CRITERIA THAT THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY USES. THEY DO MEET THOSE. MORE THAN 80% OF CHILDREN IN CARE HAVE SIGNIFICANT EMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AND THAT RATE IS FOUR TIMES WHAT IT IS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION. THE MOST COMMON DIAGNOSES. AMONG FOSTER CARE POPULATIONS ARE ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER OPPOSITIONAL DEFIANT DISORDER CONDUCT DISORDER [inaudible] ANXIETY DEPRESSION EATING AND SLEEPING DISORDERS SOCIAL PHOBIA SEPARATION ANXIETY. MOOD DISORDERS AND ESPECIALLY PTSD. PTSD IS REPORTED IN 25%. OF ADOLESCENCE IN FOSTER CARE. THAT RATE IS TWICE THE RATE OF RETURNING VETERANS. AND IT'S MORE THAN SIX TIMES THE RATE OF YOUTH IN THE GENERAL POPULATION. TEENS IN CARE OF FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO HAVE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE. AND FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A DRUG DEPENDENCY DIAGNOSIS THAN THEIR PEERS. FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN DEVELOPMENTAL ISSUES ARISING FROM EARLY LIFE STRESS INCLUDE LANGUAGE DISORDERS POOR SOCIAL ADAPTIVE SKILLS. AND DELAYED FINE MOTOR SKILLS. IN OLDER CHILDREN WE SEE HIGHER RATES OF LEARNING DISABILITIES AND BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS. COMPLEX TRAUMA CAN LIMIT OVERALL NEUROCOGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT RESULTING IN MEMORY DEFICIT AND DIFFICULTIES WITH PROBLEM SOLVING. COGNITIVE SCORES ARE LOWER FOR KIDS IN CARE THAN FOR THEIR PEERS AND OVER 40% OF SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN AND PLACEMENT. REQUIRE SPECIAL EDUCATION WHY BECAUSE THEY HAVE EITHER SEVERE ATTENTION DIFFICULTY THEY'RE COPING WITH A LOT COMING FROM THE INSIDE. AND OVER THERE POOR INCOME IMPULSE CONTROL OR AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR THAT PREVENTS THEM FROM BEING SUCCESSFUL IN A REGULAR CLASSROOM. AMONG OLDER ADOLESCENTS PTSD IS THE MOST COMMON DIAGNOSIS FOLLOWED BY ALCOHOL DISORDERS MAJOR DEPRESSION AND OTHER SUBSTANCE RELATED PROBLEMS AND GIRLS ARE AT HIGHER RISK FOR BOTH PTSD AND MAJOR DEPRESSION. LGBTQ YOUTH ARE OVER REPRESENTED IN FOSTER YOU POPULATIONS. IN THE GENERAL POPULATION ESTIMATES ABOUT 8210% HELLO HOW RELIABLE YOU KNOW GIVEN THAT. MANY PEOPLE DO NOT SELF REPORT -- BUT UPWARDS OF FIFTY I PERCENT OF YOUTH ELEVEN AND ALL DURING CARE IDENTIFIES L. G. B.. LGBT YOUTH IN CARE HAVE TWICE THE RATE OF CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS. TWO TO THREE TIMES HIGHER ODDS OF HAVING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AND SIX TIMES THE LIKELIHOOD. OF CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA. LGBTQ YOUTH ARE HIGHER RISK OF EXPERIENCING MALE CHILD MALTREATMENT. THEY HAVE AN ESTIMATE AT AN ELEVATED PREVALENCE OF SUICIDALITY. AND TWICE THE LIKELIHOOD OF A SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEM. FOR COMMERCIALLY SEXUALLY EXPLOITED CHILDREN AND YOU CAN SEE I'M JUMPING AROUND BECAUSE THESE WERE ALL THE THINGS THAT -- I THINK YOU WANTED TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT -- AN UNDERLYING HISTORY OF ABUSE. MAKES A CHILD MUCH MORE VULNERABLE TO TRAFFICKING. TO BEING TRAFFICKED. THE PREVALENCE OF CHILD ABUSE AMONG SEASICK CHILDREN. IS ESTIMATED BETWEEN 32% AT A WHOPPING 93%. THESE CHILDREN ARE AT ELEVATED RISK FOR SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES INCLUDING SELF HARMING BEHAVIOR PTSD. COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT USE OF ALCOHOL AND OTHER SUBSTANCES RISKY BEHAVIORS CRIMINAL OFFENDING SCHOOL FAILURE. AND MULTIPLE SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT. THE EXPERIENCES OF EARLY LIFE. WHEN THEY'RE POSITIVE AND WHEN THEY'RE NEGATIVE HAVE PROFOUND IMPACT ON DEVELOPING CHILDREN? MALTREATMENT REMOVAL FROM HOME LOSS OF SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS AND ONE OR MORE PLACEMENTS DURING CHILDHOOD OR ADOLESCENCE. CAN SET A CHILD ON A PATH TO PLACEMENT INSTABILITY SCHOOL FAILURE. AND FAILURE TO THRIVE IN RELATIONSHIPS AND IN LIFE. BUT INTERVENTIONS AND POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS HAVE THE SAME POWER. TO CONSTRUCT A POSITIVE PATH [inaudible] EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL AND A SCREENINGS. CAN POINT TO INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN IMMEDIATELY BEGIN TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHETHER THEY'RE SYSTEM INTERVENTIONS OR CHILD CENTERED INTERVENTIONS. AND PREVENT LONGER TERM CON CHILDHOOD TRAUMA. WE SHOULD DO ALL WE CAN TO RESTORE AND SAFEGUARD HEALTHY DEVELOPMENTAL AND EDUCATIONAL TRAJECTORY FOR THE CHILDREN IN OUR CARE. PROVIDING ENVIRONMENTS INTERVENTIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS THAT PROMOTE HEALING AND GROWTH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARM DO WE IF YOU CAN THE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR ANY COMMENTS. A WHO. WELL I'LL ASK THE QUESTION -- KATRINA THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR A PERSONAL ACCOUNT. IN YOU -- SAID A BIG GATE WOULD BE FOCUSING RESOURCES ON SORT OF THE CARE GIVERS THE FAMILIES. THAT THEY WOULD DO A BETTER JOB OF PROVIDING SUPPORT. HOSE WHEN YOU'RE SORT OF STATEMENTS OF A BIG PRIORITY WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE DO YOU THINK -- YOU KNOW. WHAT WOULD BE IF YOUR SAY ONE BIG THING THAT COULD HELP CARE GIVERS. BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN THAT ROLE IN PROVIDING STABILITY OF WELL WHAT WHAT MIGHT IT BE WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND. WELL I THINK THEY USE LAST CENTERS QUALITY PARENTING INITIATIVE HAS DONE SOME GREAT WORK AND I KNOW INVENTOR COUNTY THEY HAVE A PROCESS CREATED ACTUALLY BY A FOSTER PARENT. PARENT PARTNER SO SOMEONE WHO WAS AND I THINK STILL AS A FOSTER PARENT AND NOW SUPPORTS A MENTOR AS OTHER FOSTER PARENTS. AND BASICALLY WHEN A FAMILY PUTS IN A SEVEN DAY NOTICE THEY PROVIDE SEVEN TO TEN WEEKS OF TRAINING AROUND. TRAUMA GRIEF AND LOSS AND 90% OF THE SEVEN DAY NOTICE SAYS ARE THAN REST SEND IT BECAUSE THE FAMILIES HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF BOTH WHAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GOING. TO THRILL AND THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND WHAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO TO CREATE A HEALING ENVIRONMENT SO I THINK SEEING SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL COULD REALLY IMPACT STABILITY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. AND BECAUSE EVEN WHEN. FOSTER PARENTS FEEL LIKE GIVING UP THEN THEY'RE GIVEN THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR ROLE IS AND UNDERSTAND HOW TO DO THAT WHILE RATE. THAT THAT'S FOR RESIDENTS WITH ME WHEN I WAS GROWING UP I WAS THE YOUNGEST OF FOUR BOYS. AND WHEN I WAS IN [inaudible] MIDDLE SCHOOL. MY PARENTS INVITED A YOUNG MAN FROM THE SENATOR COUNTY FOSTER CARE SYSTEM STAY WITH US. AND HONESTLY THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH HIM. HE WAS DIFFERENT THAN THEY ARE THERE FOR BOYS. AND IN A FAIRLY SHORT TIME HE WAS NO LONGER IN THE WHOLE. AND MY PARENTS WERE GOOD PEOPLE AND HILL. TRUST ME. RAISING FOR COOLEY BOYS WAS A LITTLE BIT LIKE BEING A LION TAMER -- BUT SOMEHOW THEY DIDN'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS YOUNG MAN AND HIS NEEDS. AS FOR GAVE UP SO COULD I JUST ADD. TO A CATALINA'S COMMENTS TO SAY THAT ANOTHER WAY OF I THINK MAKING SOME SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS. IS THE PRE PLACEMENT FAMILY FOR JUST THE REASON THAT YOU MENTION THAT IS IF PEOPLE HAVE DIRECT HELP IN PREPARING. FOR THE PERSON THERE THAT'S ACTUALLY COMING TO THEM AND HOW. THAT RELATIONSHIP CAN BE YOU KNOW HELP TO START. IN A GOOD WAY ESPECIALLY. YOU KNOW IF THAT HAPPENS BEFORE THE CHILD IS PLACED. AND MAYBE DURING THE PLACEMENT YOU KNOW AT THAT HAPPENS NOW BUT I THINK THERE IS NOT. AS MUCH PRE PLACEMENT INDIVIDUAL SPECIFIC. WORK. OKAY. THAT MAKES SENSE TO YOU CREEK TWENTY YEAH I THINK THAT. MY BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THAT IT'S THE SYSTEM CAN BE VERY QUICK INCLUDING CARE GIVERS OR CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES VERY QUICK TO CALL THE POLICE ARE FIFTY ONE FIFTY OR PUNISH THE YOUNG PERSON -- WHEN REALLY THE PROBLEM ISN'T? THE PROBLEM ISN'T THAT YOUNG PERSON'S BEHAVIOUR IT'S THE WAY THAT PEOPLE AROUND THEM ARE RESPONDING TO IT AND IF THEY HAD PEOPLE AROUND THEM WERE RESPONDING TO THAT BEHAVIOR MORE APPROPRIATELY THEN THE BEHAVIOR WITH CHANGE. THAT'S WHAT BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE TEACHES US RIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT CHILD AND ADOLESCENT DEVELOPMENT -- IS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE BRAIN SCIENCE YOUNG PEOPLE RESPOND TO REWARDS AND FOSTER CARE IS A PUNISHMENT BASED SYSTEM WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE -- HAVE TO EARN GOOD THINGS BUT IT'S A LOT HARDER TO EARN A GOOD THING THAT IT IS TO BE PUNISHED FOR SOMETHING THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN REALLY NEED TO DO. AND THAT'S KIND OF AN ELABORATION ON YOUR OWN INITIAL TESTIMONY YOU WERE DESCRIBING YOUR EXPERIENCE. RIGHT NOW OKAY THANK YOU. FIRST OFF -- COMPANY NOW YOU. HAVE A TREMENDOUS VOICE AND I BET THERE'S A WONDERFUL BACKSTORY. FOR FOR WHY YOU BECAME A SOCIAL WORKER AND WANTED TO HELP OTHERS. BUT I REALLY WANTED TO FOCUS IF I COULD AS WELL ON TO WHAT WE CAN DO BETTER. WHEN WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY? I WAS RECENTLY AT A NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON A SAYS I'M A BIG FAN AND DON'T GET ME SO BOXING ABOUT DRAMA OKAY. AND YET. ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS ECHOED WHAT YOU WERE SAYING. AND I'M SAYING IF WE'VE INCARCERATED SOMEONE AND AS A RESULT OF THAT THEY'VE BEEN PLACED INTO THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM WHY ARE WE NOT SIMULTANEOUSLY PROVIDING THEM PARENTING COURSES. FOR WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED. IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY WHILE WE HAVE THEM IN OUR HAPPEN WITH US. TO HELP GIVING THEM SOME TOOLS THAT THEY NEEDED ABOUT BEING A PARENT IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY. HAVING THREE YOUNG DAUGHTERS MYSELF THERE ISN'T A RULE BOOK THAT THEY HAND YOU AND YET. LIKE THE DOCTOR WAS SAYING THOSE EARLY ESTABLISHMENT OF THAT THOSE DISRUPTIONS AN ATTACHMENT ARE SO LIFELONG AND TRAUMATIZED. SO I'M GONNA WANT TO REACH OUT TO YOU GOT THAT ENOUGH WE CAN TO FIGURE OUT IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN GIVING VOICE TO BECAUSE I AM WILLING TO ACCEPT YOUR CHALLENGE AND FIGURE OUT HOW. THOSE OF US CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF MAKING SURE THAT WE LISTEN TO ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES AS WELL. BUT FINALLY IF I CAN WE'RE NOT GOING TO COME UP WITH THE ANSWERS OURSELVES THAT'S WHY WE NEEDED THIS HEARING TODAY. AND I'M SO APPRECIATIVE THAT YOU'RE HERE TODAY TO GIVE VOICE TO THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THE NIGHT AND MY MY AND SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT GOING -- TO SOLVE ANY ISSUES RIGHT NOW BUT MY IS THE GROUP HOMES I MEAN THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF CONCERNS RIGHT BY. WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT THE GROUP HOMES I HAD A SITUATION ACTUALLY MY SISTER WHERE SHE MET A FOSTER KID OD TWO WEEKS AGO? AND HE WAS -- REALLY SHAKEN UP AND SAYS I HAVE TO GO HOME I HAVE TO GO HOME -- AND IT WAS LIKE SEVEN PM AND HE SAYS IF I DON'T MAKE IT HOME BY EIGHT I DON'T GET TO EAT. AND AND THAT IS STILL WITH ME I IT'S DISTURBING ME STILL BECAUSE I WISH I KNEW WHAT THE KIDS THAT YOU KNOW I WISH I COULD DO SOMETHING -- BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS OUT OF THE ORDINARY FROM WHAT I HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT ITS THE PUNISHMENT BASED SYSTEM. ABOUT WHAT THEY DO AND DON'T DO AND I WOULD AT SOME POINT YOU KNOW AND HOPEFULLY -- WE CAN CHAT AFTER YOU CHAT WITH THE DOCTOR ARAMBULA ABOUT THE THE GROUP HOMES. AND IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO. TO SUPPORT BECAUSE I ALSO KNOW THAT IN A GROUP HOME THERE IS YOU KNOW WHAT I KNOW. MORE THAN ONE CHILD PER CARE GIVER AND SO HOW DO WE SUPPORT THOSE GROUP HOME -- CARE GIVERS BIG BEING THAT THERE'S MULTIPLE CHILDREN IN THE HOME AND AND YOUR EXPERIENCES THAT OBVIOUSLY IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE IT WAS A POSITIVE ONE IF YOU WITH A WALL TO SET A COUPLE TIMES. THERE WAS A REASON FOR IT AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR OR MAYBE IF pTHOUGHT INTO IT MAYBE WE CAN MEET AT SOME POINT I AND SO THAT YOU CAN HELP ME UNDERSTAND. ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO IN TERMS OF TRAINING THOSE THAT ARE HAVE MULTIPLE -- KIDS IN THEIR CARE. AND I DON'T. I WOULD LIKE TO FIX IT TODAY. I MEAN IF I'M A FOR HONEST I WISH WE CAN COME UP WITH ALL OF THE FIXES AND SAY HEY OKAY THIS IS WHAT WE'RE DOING AND IT'S GOOD AND WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON BUT THAT'S NOT OUR REALITY. AND UNFORTUNATELY BUT IT FEELS. HORRIBLE TO SAY THAT BECAUSE WHILE THIS IS NOT OUR REALITY THEY'RE STILL FOSTER KIDS THIRDS SUFFERING RIGHT NOW. AND SO THAT'S IT'S DIFFICULT TO TO TALK ABOUT BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS. IN IN FUTURE I'M HOW OF THE FOSTER AND THE GROUP HOMES OR EVEN THE JUVENILE -- CENTER WE CAN PROVIDE SERVICE SERVICES. TO THE CARE GIVERS SO THAT THEY CAN SUPPORT THE KIDS A LITTLE BIT BETTER NOW BEALL CONTACT YOU AND SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN YOU KNOW THROUGH THE SEA WHITE -- SEE WE CAN YOU KNOW HAVE A BIGGER DISCUSSION AT SOME POINT BUT THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT I'M INTERESTED IN FOR NOW IF YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IT AND YOU KNOW IN THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS IF WE CAN MEET WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU YES. I JUST WANTED TO ADD ONE MORE COMMENT I WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS THAT LATER WHEN KATHY CENTRELINK IS UP HERE AND MAYBE I'LL JUST PREFACE IT BY THE BUT YOUR COMMENT REGARDING. THAT -- WE PENALIZE PEOPLE BY CALLING THE POLICE. WHO ELSE CAN WE CALL? AND WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO THAT'S A BETTER RESPONSE THAN THAT. THAT MAKING SURE WE'RE MEETING THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITIES THAT'S WHAT I HOPE KATHY IS ABLE TO TALK ABOUT LATER AND SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON BECAUSE THE ANSWER CAN'T BE TO LOCK THEM UP. THEY CAN'T BE TO DRAMATIZE THEM pOF BEHAVIORS THAT ISN'T WORKING WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT. AND CHANGE THE SYSTEM AND THE PORT THAT. THANK YOU WE GET WE'RE GIVING YOU A LOT OF HOMEWORK BUT THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE THANK YOU. AND I'M A CAL GRANT TO GO BEARS.

SYSTEM AND ALL FOSTER CHILDREN ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE OUR MEDIC HOUSE THE STATE'S MEDICAID PROGRAM -- AND SO ON LIKE ADULTS AND NON FOSTER CHILDREN WHERE ELIGIBILITY WILL DEPEND UPON HOUSEHOLD INCOME OR ON IMMIGRATION STATUS FOSTER CHILDREN GAIN ACCESS TO MEDICAL. REGARDLESS CHILDREN GENERALLY ON MEDI CAL INCLUDING FOSTER CHILDREN ARE ENTITLED TO A MORE COMPREHENSIVE ARRAY OF SIR OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS. THAN ADULTS ARE -- THIS BENEFIT IS KNOWN AS THE EARLY PERIODIC. SCREENING DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OR E. P. S. T. E. P. S. D. T. BENEFIT. AND IN GENERAL THE EPS TEACH -- INDIVIDUALS UP TO AGE -- TWENTY ONE TO PERIODIC PERIODIC HEALTH SCREENINGS TO CERTAIN SERVICES THAT WOULD NIGHT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE TO ADULTS AND TWO RELATIVELY LESS STRINGENT MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA. IN ORDER TO RECEIVE SERVICES MENTAL HEALTH. SERVICES ARE A COMPONENT UNDER THE PST TEAM. NOW FOR MEDI CAL SERVICES WE CAN GENERALLY DIVIDE THEM INTO SPECIAL THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND NON SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. SPECIAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE THOSE FOR THAT ARE -- RELATIVELY INTENSIVE AND FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH -- GENERALLY WITH A HIGHER LEVEL OF SEVERITY OR LIFE IMPAIRMENTS -- CAUSED BY THEIR MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION -- AT LEAST ON THE ADULT SIDE OR JUST -- TO MENTAL CAT MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS THAT PRECLUDE APPROPRIATE DEVELOPMENT IN CHILDREN -- EXAMPLES OF SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENT SERVICES OR GROUP OR INDIVIDUAL THERAPY AND COUNTIES ARE THE ADMINISTERING ENTITY FOR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE STATE. ON THE OTHER HAND FOR NON SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WITHIN MEDI CAL INDIVIDUALS MAY ACCESS THESE PRIMARILY OUTPATIENT -- LESS INTENSIVE SERVICES CARE PHYSICIAN AND THESE ARE PROVIDED THROUGH EITHER MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE OR THROUGH FEE FOR SERVICE FOR FOSTER FOSTER CARE KIDS ARE NOT -- MANDATORILY ENROLLED IN MANAGED CARE SO MANY OF THESE CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE ARE GOING TO ACCESS THE ANY MILD AND POTENTIAL MILD TO MODERATE BENEFITS THROUGH THE FEE FOR SERVICE IT FOR THREE THREE THE FEE FOR SERVICE SYSTEM WITH THEIR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN THERE. ULTIMATELY THERE ARE MULTIPLE STATE AND COUNTY ENTITIES THAT A RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TOTAL CARE AND SUPERVISION OF CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE -- COUNTY WELFARE DEPARTMENT SUPERVISED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE REALLY FOR THE FOSTER CARE SIDE OF THINGS -- FOR THE CARE AND SUPERVISION OF THE CHILDREN WERE AS COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS -- WITH OVERSIGHT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND INCLUDING THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- THAT ARE DELIVERED FOR CHILDREN AND FOR FOSTER CHIP FOSTER CHILDREN SPECIFICALLY -- FINALLY WAS THE MANAGED CARE PLANS IN THE FEE FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT WILL DELIVER THOSE AND TULARE MILD TO MODERATE BENEFITS -- AS WELL AS SCREENING AND REFERRAL OF CHILDREN -- TO SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. TURNING TO PAGE THREE PROVIDE A AN OVERVIEW OF CHILDREN ESPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SO THESE ARE THE MEDI CAL SERVICES AND THESE ARE REALLY AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE SERVICES THAT -- FOSTER CHILDREN MIGHT UTILIZE -- BEING CATEGORICALLY ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL AND REALLY COVERING SORT OF A BROAD SERVICES AND SPREAD MEDI CAL AND SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IS JUST A IT'S A KEY AREA. OF SERVICES THAT FOSTER CHILDREN ARE GOING TO ULTIMATELY RECEIVE AND AS WITH THE AS WITH MEDI CAL BENEFITS BROADLY THE ELIGIBILITY FOR SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IS IS BROADER FOR CHILDREN AND FOR ADULTS I UNDERSTAND THE NEXT SPEAKER IS GOING. TO GO INTO THAT IN GREATER DETAIL SO ALL -- I'LL LEAVE THAT THEIR BUT SO MOVING ON TO HOW WHERE FOSTER KIDS FIT INTO THE LARGER SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. IN A GIVEN YEAR ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND CHILDREN RECEIVES A SPECIAL ANY SPECIAL BE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SO THIS IS ALL CHILDREN ON MEDI CAL. ABOUT FORTY FORTY THOUSAND OF THESE ARE OUR FOSTER CHILDREN SO ABOUT 15% OF THE SPECIAL THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES CHILDREN'S CASELOAD. REPRESENTS FOSTER CHILDREN. TURNING TO PAGE -- FOR THERE'S A FIGURE HERE -- AND THIS SHOWS THAT FOSTER CHILDREN UTILIZE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT A MUCH HIGHER RATE THAN ALL CHILDREN ON MEDI CAL -- ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THAT FIGURE ABOUT 50% OF FOSTER CHILDREN WILL RECEIVE AT LEAST ONE SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE WITHIN A GIVEN YEAR. AS COMPARES TO LESS THAN 5% FOR MEDI CAL CHILDREN GENERALLY SO ABOUT TEN TIMES THE RATE -- NOW. ONE SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE MIGHT ONLY MEAN THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY GETTING AN ASSESSMENT HOWEVER -- SO TO REALLY BE ABLE TO SEE WHO IS REALLY CONTINUOUSLY ENGAGED IN TREATMENT AND SO FORTH -- I WOULD TURN TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE FIGURE WHICH SHOWS THE NUMBER OF THE RATE OF AT WHICH CHILDREN -- RECEIVE AT LEAST FIVE SPECIAL THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WITHIN A GIVEN YEAR AND THAT SHOWS THAT ABOUT 35%. OF FOSTER KIDS ARE. TO SOME DEGREE CONTINUOUSLY ENGAGED IN SOME SORT OF SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR OR AS THAT RATE IS ABOUT 3% FOR MEDI CAL -- CHILDREN AS A WHOLE SO THEY DO UTILIZE -- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT A AT A AT A HIGHER RATE THERE. THE ON TURNING TO PAGE FIVE THE STATEWIDE SPENDING AVERAGES ALSO DIFFER FOR FOSTER CHILDREN VERSUS -- YOU KNOW NON FOSTER CHILDREN ON MEDI CAL WE AT ONE COULD SAY -- THERE THIRTY THREE DEAF 50% HIGH CAPITA EXPENDITURES ON FOSTER CHILDREN SO THAT COULD POINT TO THE FACT THAT -- FOSTER CHILDREN ARE RECEIVING RELATIVELY MORE INTENSIVE SERVICES AS WELL NOT ONLY JUST A A HIGHER NUMBER OF SERVICES. AND THEN LASTLY JUST NOTE THAT -- SPENDING ON THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SERVICES WITHIN MEDI CAL AND AT THE COUNTY LEVEL HAS INCREASED FAIRLY SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS. GROWING OVER ALL FOR ALL KIDS FROM ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION TO TWO BILLION BETWEEN TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN IS ABOUT 6% ANNUAL GROWTH RATE. AND THE RATE OF GROWTH -- IS JUST A A LITTLE SMALLER FOR FOSTER KIDS BUT PRETTY COMPARABLE. SO THAT'S THAT'S MEDI CAL SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ANOTHER -- IMPORTANT AREA OF SERVICES AND FUNDING IS WHAT'S AVAILABLE THROUGH THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT -- ALSO KNOWN AS PROP SIXTY THREE OR SHORTEN TO MHSAA AND THIS PROVIDES -- FUNDING TO REALLY INCREASE -- THE ARRAY OF SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE -- TO BOTH CHILDREN AND TWO ADULTS IT'S OUT FUNDED IT'S THE THE REVENUES GENERATED BY SURTAX ON INCOMES OVER ONE MILLION DOLLARS. AND IT'S REALLY FOCUSED ON PROVIDING OFTEN -- SERVICES THAT WOULDN'T BE COVERED BY MEDICARE ALL SO NOT BY SPECIAL WHAT THESE ARE NOT NECESSARILY SPECIALLY MENTAL SERVICES. AND THESE WOULD BE SUCH THINGS AS WRAPAROUND SERVICES PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES -- AS WELL AS SORT OF VERY HIGHLY INTENSIVE SERVICES -- FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGH NEEDS AND ESPECIALLY ON THE PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION THAT THAT IS SORT OF TARGETED TOWARDS CHILDREN -- IN GENERAL AND SO FOSTER CARE KIDS WHILE WHAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY DATA REALLY ON HOW MUCH. PREVENTION EARLY AND INTERVENTION FUNDING SAY. IT GOES TOWARDS FOSTER CARE KIDS BECAUSE REALLY COUNTIES HAVE. A WIDE WIDE AMOUNT OF LATITUDE AND DISCRETION OVER HOW THEY SPEND THESE FUNDS IN THE TYPES OF POPULATIONS THAT THEY TARGET. IT IS LIKELY THAT FOSTER CARE -- CHILDREN DO BENEFIT SOME FROM THE SERVICES. UP NEXT I JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM WHICH IS A PACKAGE OF LEGISLATIVE COLLATION -- PASSED IN RECENT YEARS THAT DOES A BROADER ARRAY OF THINGS AND PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON REDUCING RELIANCE IN ON INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS LIKE CONGREGATE CARE AND BOOSTING THE CAPACITY OF HOME BASED FAMILY PLACEMENTS -- CCAR AS IT'S KNOWN DOES A SET OF CHANGES TO SPECIAL ATIV MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE DELIVERY -- IN REALLY TRYING TO INCREASE ACCESS TO THOSE SERVICES -- THE FOR EXAMPLE CCR PLACEMENT SETTINGS THAT TYPICALLY SERVE FOSTER CHILDREN WITH SOMEWHAT ELEVATED NEEDS ARE WILL NOW BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES EITHER BY. DIRECTLY EMPLOYING MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS ON THEIR STAFF OR BY WORKING WITH CONTRACTED PROVIDERS -- WHO WILL COME AND SERVE THE THE THEIR CHILDREN? AND THEN THE LAST SECTIONS AND NOW ON PAGE -- EIGHT I'M GONNA GIVE A A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES HERE -- FUNDING IS RATHER COMPLEX AND AS I NOTED AT THE OUTSET. THE WAY THAT THE FUNDING IS STRUCTURED IS THAT IT SUPPORTS SORT OF MULTIPLE POPULATION SO THERE IS. IN GENERAL IT'S THERE IS NO FUNDING THAT'S SAY -- ART THERE'S IN GENERAL FUNDING IS NOT STRUCTURED SO THAT SPECIFICALLY TARGETS FOSTER CHILDREN INSTEAD IT'S IT'S FUNDING GENERALLY FOR CHILDREN'S SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OR OR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR INDIGENT POPULATIONS BROADLY. BUT FOSTER CHILDREN DO RELY ON THESE FUNDING STREAMS FOR THE SERVICES THAT THEY DO RECEIVE SO -- JUST A JUST A HIGHLIGHT THAT SO THERE'S A FIGURE ON PAGE EIGHT THAT KIND OF GIVES AN OVER ARCHING VIEW AND THEN AS I GO THROUGH THE NEXT PAGES ALL ALL BRIEFLY KIND OF DESCRIBE WHAT THOSE ARE. SO FIRST THERE'S THERE'S FUNDING FOR THE NON COUNTY -- BASED THE HEALTH SERVICES THESE ARE THOSE MILD TO MODERATE SERVICES AND AND THAT'S GENERAL THE STATE GENERAL FUND -- AND MATCHED WITH THE FEDERAL MEDICAID DOLLARS THAT GO THROUGH EITHER THE STATE'S FEE FOR SERVICE SYSTEM OR THROUGH MANAGED CARE PLANS FORTUNATELY THE FUNDING AMOUNT IS IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME -- BUT IT IT IT LIKELY IS FAIRLY WELL ULTIMATELY FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT -- THE NEXT THE NEXT MAJOR FRONT FUNDING SOURCES ARE THOSE THAT GO TO COUNTY BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THESE THERE ARE AN ARRAY OF FUNDING SOURCES AND I'LL JUST DESCRIBE -- THE THE MAJOR ONES HERE. FIRST HERE IS THE FEDERAL FUND PARTICIPATION THIS OF THE FEDERAL MEDICAID FUNDING -- THAT THE STATE RECEIVES NOW -- DIFFERENT POPULATIONS -- YOU GET A DIFFERENT SORT OF MATCH RATE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF MEDICAID -- DOLLARS FOR FOSTER CHILDREN IT'S GENERALLY GOING TO ALWAYS BE 50% SO FOR ANY SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE THAT A FOSTER CHILD IS GOING TO USE -- THAT'S TYPICALLY GOING TO BE MATCHED WITH A 50% OF FEDERAL FUNDS ARE AT LEAST A 50% OF FUNDING WILL COMPRISE THAT WILL BE COMPRISED THERE. IN -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FOR COUNTY BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. FOR ALL MEDI CAL AND REALLY SEARCH FOSTER KIDS FUNDING WAS -- FEDERAL FUNDING FOR MEDICAID WAS THREE BILLION DOLLARS. NEXT WE HAVE -- LOCAL REALIGNMENT DOLLARS AND WHAT THESE ARE IS THAT THE STATE DEDICATES A PORTION OF SALES TAX AND VEHICLE LICENSE FEE REVENUE. AND SEND IT TO COUNTIES TO PAY FOR THE COUNTY'S RESIDENTS -- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES FAVOR OF SERVICES COMPRISE BOTH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND SUBSTANCE USE SERVICES FOR COUNTIES HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH FUNDING THAT THEY RECEIVE GOES TO MENTAL HEALTH SPECIFICALLY OR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND SO FORTH. BUT THIS IS REALLY THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF NON FEDERAL FUNDING FOR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- FOR CHILDREN CELL AND IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THERE'S AN ESTIMATED TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT WENT TO COUNTIES AND LOCAL REALIGNMENT REVENUES FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES AND THIS FUNDING SUPPORT SERVICES FOR FOSTER KIDS. NEXT THURS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUND THIS IS GENERATED THROUGH THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT AND PROVIDES THOSE VARIOUS INTO INTENSIVE -- PREVENTIVE SERVICES AND IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS WILL GO DOWN TO COUNTIES -- TO SUPPORT COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- AND AND SOME PORTION OF THAT -- MAY SUPPORT SERVICES FOR FOSTER KIDS FINALLY THERE'S THE STATE GENERAL FUND CONTRIBUTION NOW BECAUSE THE STATE DEDICATES OF FUNDING IN THE FORM OF THE LOCAL REALIGNMENT REVENUES. TO COUNTIES FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THE GENERAL FUND CONTRIBUTION TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IS ACTUALLY SOMEWHAT LIMITED -- GENERAL FUND TODAY -- TYPICALLY GOES FOR WHAT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER NEW STATE FEDERAL OR JUDICIAL MANDATES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPOSED SENSE WE SORT OF CREATED THE FUNDING FORMULAS THAT SEND THE VEHICLE LICENSE FEE AND SALES TAX REVENUE DOWN TO THE COUNTIES. AND SO IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THERE'S AN ESTIMATED HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND THAT GOES -- TO SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT THE COUNTY LEVEL REALLY FOR ALL MEDI CAL AND RELEASE AND FOSTER CHILDREN SERVICES. ARE INCLUDED IN THAT SO ALL LAST TOUCH ON SOME OF THE TRENDS -- FUNDING FOR COUNTY MENTAL SERVICES HAS GROWN FAIRLY SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS -- BETWEEN TWENTY TWELVE AND TWENTY TWELVE THIRTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TOTAL FUNDING FOR COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. HAS GROWN FROM ABOUT FIVE POINT FOUR BILLION TO ABOUT SEVEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS -- THIS IS AN ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF AROUND 8% AND I MEAN JUST TO TIE IT BACK TO SO THAT'S SORT OF ON THE REVENUE SIDE FOR COUNTIES TO TIE BACK TO WHERE SPENDING. AS WE SAW FOR CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH SIR SPENDING INCREASES ON THE RANGE OF ABOUT 526% SO LITTLE HIGHER REVENUE GROWTH -- BUT YOU KNOW CERTAINLY NOT A MAGNITUDE DIFFERENCE THERE -- SO THAT'LL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS IT COMPLICATED AIRY BUT HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS. WILL BE READING ABOUT THIS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT I'M SURE. THANK YOU. WELCOME. AFTERNOON I'M KIM SUDIRMAN AND I AM A CONSULTANT FOR THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. AND I'M ALSO RETIRED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR FROM YOLO COUNTY AND PREVIOUSLY AT SEVERAL OTHER COUNTY AS THE CHILDREN'S DEPUTY OVER CHILDREN YOU SERVICES. SO QUITE A FEW YEARS SERVING OF THIS POPULATION WHICH WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY AND SO MY PORTION IS REALLY SPECIFICALLY TO MEDI CAL -- I'LL DO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH IN GENERAL -- BEEN WENT OVER QUITE A BIT OF IT BUT I WANTED TO REALLY -- I HAVE THREE HAND OUTS FOR YOU AND I WILL MENTION THEM BUT NOT WALK THROUGH THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE DETAILED SO THAT YOU CAN SEE. THERE THE MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALTY SERVICES DEFINITIONS SO IT'S A LIST OF ALL THE SERVICES IN THE DEFINITIONS THAT GO WITH THEM -- MEDICAL NECESSITY WHICH I WILL TALK ABOUT FOR EPS T. T. AND THEN A BRIEF -- PAGE ABOUT MANAGED PROVIDE SO -- LET ME JUST BEGIN. BY SAYING THAT -- THERE ARE SERVICES BETTER PEOPLE THINK OF WHEN THEY THINK OF MENTAL HEALTH THAT ARE FAIRLY TRADITIONAL. PEOPLE THINK OF OF INDIVIDUAL THERAPY FAMILY THERAPY GROUP THERAPY AND SEEING A PSYCHIATRIST THAT WAS A VERY COMMON SERVICES IN THOSE ARE SERVICES. THE CAT THAT THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND OR THEIR PROVIDERS -- THAT THEY CONTRACT WITH PROVIDE. BUT THERE'S A WHOLE TON OF COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR THE CHILDREN -- IN THE FOSTER YOU FOSTER CARE SYSTEM THAT ARE CRITICAL AND MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE MUCH OF WHICH ARE NOT PROVIDED BY THE COUNTIES. BY THE COUNTIES ORGANIZATION PROVIDERS WHICH YOU'LL HEAR FROM SOME OF THEM THIS AFTERNOON AFTER MYSELF AND SO THAT PARTNERSHIP IS REALLY CRITICAL -- WE THINK OF OUR PROVIDERS AS US AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THAT PARTNERSHIP AND WORK WELL TOGETHER TO SERVE THE KIDS BECAUSE SO MUCH. IS IN THE COMMUNITY AND MY MY OPINION AFTER BUSINESS IS IF WE COULDN'T DO COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES AND I REMEMBER THE DAYS WHEN WE DID NOT. OTHER THAN CASE MANAGEMENT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SERVE THE KIDS AS THEY NEED IT AND CERTAINLY TODAY AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING -- YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT WRAPAROUND YOU HEAR SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS LIKE -- YOU KNOW WE DID CHILDREN SYSTEM OF CARE BACK IN NINETY FOUR WHEN IT STARTED. YOU KNOW EPS CITY YOU'VE HEARD OF ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS WRAPAROUND WAS MENTIONED. ALL OF THOSE ARE DESIGNED TO ADDRESS CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN THE COMMUNITY. AND AS YOU HEARD KATERINA TALK ABOUT THEIR STILL NEEDS I KNOW SEE SEE OUR CONTINUING CARE REFORM. IS TRYING TO TAKE A STAB AT GETTING THAT CHANGE AND I THINK WE'RE MAKING GOOD HEADWAY BUT WE'RE AT THE BEGINNING -- YOU'LL HEAR I'M SURE ABOUT THE GROUP HOME PROVIDERS A RESIDENTIAL PROVIDERS THAT ARE WORKING HARD AND MAKING CHANGES BUT THERE THAT IT'S JUST A START. SO I'M HOPING THAT -- NEXT YEAR YOU HEAR A VERY DIFFERENT SCENARIO FROM HR YOUTH THAT WENT THROUGH THE SYSTEM. THIS YEAR THEN YOU HEARD FROM KATERINA WHO WENT THROUGH THE SYSTEM. QUITE A FEW YEARS AGO BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE MADE SOME GAINS NOTHING'S PERFECT BUT I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THOSE COMMUNITY BASED LIKE SERVICES -- LIKE TBS THERAPEUTIC BE ACTUALLY PROBABLY MOST OF THOSE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. BY -- COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS WHICH IS A REALLY A ONE TO ONE KIND OF SERVICES AND THEN RECENTLY INTENSIVE CARE COORDINATION INTENSIVE HOME BASED SERVICES -- AND THERAPEUTIC FOSTER CARE AGAIN ALL OF THOSE ARE NOT IN THE OFFICE. THERE IN THE COMMUNITY THEY'RE OUT AND ABOUT THERE WHERE THE CHILDREN ARE THERE PROVIDED IN A FOSTER HOME THEIR PROVIDED IN A RESIDENTIAL SETTING. THEIR PROVIDED. AT THE MALL AND WHEN YOU GO FOR A WALK AND WHEN YOU GO EAT OUT AT MCDONALDS. TO HELP REALLY. ADDRESS KIDS NEEDS IN THE MOMENT NOT WAIT TILL NEXT WEEK FOR THE FIFTY MINUTE HOUR AND WHO CAN REMEMBER THE SAME STORY THE SAME WAY ABOUT HAPPENED. INTO THOSE SERVICES ARE REALLY CRITICAL ALONG WITH TVS AND THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES THAT ARE NOT PURE MENTAL HEALTH. THAT VERY MUCH INTERACTED INTER RELATE SO I THINK THAT THOSE ARE VERY CRITICAL -- THERAPEUTIC FOSTER CARE I JUST WANT TO COMMENT ABOUT THAT THAT'S HAVING THAT'S A LITTLE BITOF A SLOW START AS FOSTER PARENTS. IT'S A SCARY THING TO BE A FOSTER PARENT IT'S EVEN MORE SCARY THING TO THINK I'M GONNA LEARN HOW TO PROVIDE. MEDICAL SERVICES AND DOCUMENT IN A MEDICAL RECORD SO THERE ARE SOME A LEARNING CURVE THAT'S GOING ON AND I KNOW OUR FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES IN THE COMMUNITY ARE WORKING. ON RECRUITMENT AND TRAINING AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT THE I THOUGHT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COUNTRY ON SAID WAS. IN RELATION TO TRAINING THE PARENTS IS REALLY CRITICAL TO I REALLY WANT. TO ECHO THAT AND THAT IS THE INTENT OF THERAPEUTIC FOSTER CARE THAT IS THE INTENT OF C. C. R. WITH RESOURCE FAMILY HOMES NOW -- IN THE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS TRAUMA INFORMED CARE AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF A LOT OF NEW PRACTICES THAT ARE REALLY BEING FOCUSED ON TO HELP. THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE REALLY WORKING WITH OUR CHILDREN DAY IN AND DAY OUT TWENTY FOUR SEVEN ON HOW TO TO DO A BETTER JOB. SO I WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THAT. AND THEN JUST A COMMENT IN RELATION TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHILDREN AND ADULTS SERVICES. AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED CHILDREN SERVICES REALLY AND THEN -- MEDICAL NECESSITY DOCUMENT THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS REALLY TALKS ABOUT THAT CORRECT RUMELIA RATE. WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT IF THAT A CHILD BECOMES ELIGIBLE IF A SERVICE IF IF FOR THE CHALLENGE CAN BE CORRECTED. OR AMELIORATED THE VERY BIG DIFFERENCE THAN FROM A VERY SEVERE -- DIAGNOSIS THAT REQUIRES MAJOR INTERVENTION SIX FAST TO BE ELIGIBLE AND IF THERE'S NOT A BELIEVE THAT THEY'LL BE A MAJOR TURNAROUND. THEN THEY MAY NOT MEET CRITERIA IT'S VERY DIFFERENT IN THE CHILDREN'S WORLD AND SO WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES. TO DO SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT AND THAT IS UP TO AGE. TWENTY ONE UP TO AGE TWENTY ONE SO THROUGH AGE TWENTY SO IT'S ARE TRANSIENT TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH POPULATION AS WELL. AND THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL AND CHILD WELFARE HAS ALSO BEEN WORKING VERY HARD WITH SOME OF THE THB PLUS AND I'M BLANKING ON WITH THE T. H. P. PART IS. BUT IT'S REALLY FOR THE I HOUSING PROGRAM TEACH BE FLAT SO ANYWAY WORKING WITH THAT POPULATION. AND THEN FINALLY JUST TO COMMENT ABOUT PRIMARY CARE -- MANAGE CARE UP PLANS AND THE FEE FOR SERVICE -- THERE'S LIMITATIONS YOU KNOW THEY ARE REALLY THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN. AND THE ANALOGY I USUALLY GIVE IS IF YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF A HEART CHALLENGED USUALLY BEGIN WITH YOUR PRIMARY CARE. PHYSICIAN YOU BRING AGAIN WITH YOUR PCP AND IF YOU'RE SHE SAYS THAT YOU CAN. OUTLET MAY PRESCRIBE THERE SIR LET ME WORK WITH YOU ON THIS CHANGE YOUR EATING HABITS DO THIS EXERCISE. AND YOU CAN BE STABLE YOU'RE DONE. BUT IF. YOU NEED SOMETHING ELSE TO MORE SERIOUS YOU NEED TO SEE A CARDIOLOGISTS THAT YOU GET REFERRED. THERE THE SPECIALTY THAT'S WHAT COUNTY SPECIAL TEAM AND HEALTH DOES AND ARE CONTRACTED PROVIDERS. THE SHIFT THAT THAT HASN'T QUITE BEEN AS SUCCESSFUL. IS WHEN YOUR DONE AFTER YOU'VE HAD SIR HEART SURGERY. AND YOU'VE BEEN MONITORED FOR A YEAR OR SO AND YOU'VE BEEN STABLE AND YOU'VE CHANGED YOUR EATING HABITS. AND YOU'RE TAKING YOU WERE TAKING YOUR MEDICATION REGULARLY AND THEN YOU STABILIZE AND YOU'VE DECREASED YOUR MEDICATION AND I WERE JUST TAKING A BABY ASPIRIN. ONCE A DAY YOU GO BACK TO YOUR PCP. WE HAVE A HARDER TIME AS AS CHILDREN AND ADULTS STABILIZE GETTING THEM BACK TO THE PC P. BECAUSE ONCE THEY HAD THAT DIAGNOSIS. ONCE YOU HAD HEART PROBLEMS THAT IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE NO LONGER HAVE A DIAGNOSIS. BUT YOU'RE STABLE SO THOSE ARE SOME BUT THAT THE FOR SERVICE AND MEN MANAGED CARE PLANS REALLY ADDRESS THAT BEGINNING. AND ORDINARILY WOULD ADDRESS AT THE END AFTER SERVICES HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND SO WERE THE MIDDLE AND THE FOLKS HERE AT THE TABLE DO REALLY GOOD WORK AND HARD WORK. TO ADDRESS THAT SYSTEM AND SO THAT PARTNERSHIP IS REALLY CRITICAL. OTHER PARTNERS I JUST WANT TO ECHO SOME OF WHAT'S BEEN SAID WITH THE MALE HEALTH SERVICES ACT BUT ALSO EDUCATION IS A CRITICAL PART. OUR KIDS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IN SCHOOL AND WE WANT THEM IN SCHOOL SO PARTNERING WITH EDUCATION OBJECT BUT GENERAL EDUCATION AND SPECIAL ED -- AS WELL AS THE FAITH COMMUNITY IS REALLY CRITICAL AND WE REALLY NEED. TO NORMALIZE EVERYTHING IN A MUCH BETTER WAY KIDS SHOULD BE PLAYING LITTLE LEAGUE KID SHOULD BE PLAYING SOCCER THEY SHOULD BE TAKING GUITAR LESSONS AND BALLET LESSONS. TO AND SO THAT PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY LIVE IN IS REALLY CRITICAL SO I JUST WANTED TO ADD THOSE PIECES. TO THINK [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I AM DIANA WAGNER DIRECTOR OF CHILDREN'S SERVICES FOR SHASTA COUNTY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. PRIOR TO MY WORK AT WITH THE COUNTY. AS A CLINICIAN I PROVIDED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO FOSTER YOUTH FROM PROBATION IN CHILD WELFARE AS A THERAPIST AT VICTOR TREATMENT CENTERS AND SHASTA COUNTY FOR SIXTEEN YEARS. SHASTA COUNTY BECAME AN HHO SAY ELEVEN YEARS AGO. WHICH IS WHEN WE DIVIDED INTO FIVE BRANCHES ONE OF THOSE BRANCHES. CHILDREN SERVICES BRANCH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BOTH. CHILD WELFARE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES FOR AGES ZERO TO TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD. THERE ARE OTHER COUNTY IS SET UP SIMILAR SIMILARLY TO SHASTA COUNTY BUT MOST OF THEM ARE STILL SEPARATE SEPARATE AGENCIES. WHILE I MAY HAVE AN EASIER TIME COORDINATING SERVICES FOR FOSTER YOUTH DUE TO THE STRUCTURE AND SHASTA COUNTY. COLLABORATION BETWEEN CHILD WELFARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS ABSOLUTELY POSSIBLE AND MUST OCCUR IN ALL COUNTIES IN ORDER TO BEST SERVE FOSTER YOUTH. IN SHASTA COUNTY. FOSTER YOUTH ACCESS SERVICES. THIS WAS CHANGED IN DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AS WE IMPLEMENTED THE PROCESS OF A FULL COMPLETE COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT TO ALL FOSTER YOUTH. AGES THREE TO SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD IN TWO WEEKS OF ENTERING FOSTER CARE. YEAH ASSESSMENT IS COMPLETED BY CO LOCATED MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIAN IN OUR INTAKE UNIT. THIS CLINICIAN MEETS WITH THE CHILD PARENTS CARE GIVERS AND OTHER IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN THE CHILD'S LIVES IN ORDER TO GATHER THE INFORMATION. THE CHILD ADOLESCENT NEEDS AND STRENGTHS IS A PART OF THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS. THREE ASSESSMENT IS CONDUCTED. IN THE SAME MANNER ANNUALLY FOR THREE TO TWENTY YEAR OLDS. INTER COUNTY IMPLEMENTED A SIMILAR PROCESS IN FEBRUARY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS A CHILD WELFARE AGENCY I'M REQUIRED TO ENSURE THAT ALL FOSTER YOUTH RECEIVE AT LEAST ONE SCREENING FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WHEN THEY ENTER FOSTER CARE AND ANNUALLY THERE AFTER? BUT WHAT WE DISCOVERED IN CHEST COUNTY BY ONLY COMPLETING THE SCREENING IS THAT WE WERE NOT GETTING A FULL PICTURE OF THE FOSTER USE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. WHICH IS WHY OUR PRACTICE WAS ADJUSTED. THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO FOSTER YOUTH AND PARENT CAN ANSWER QUICK QUESTION SO FOR THE THINGS YOU FELT WERE BEING MESSED. THAT PROMPTED THE ADJUSTMENT. SO JUST AS FOR AN A FOR EXAMPLE OKAY FOR EXAMPLE -- THERE WAS A SET OF FIFTEEN TWENTY QUESTIONS THAT WERE KIND OF CHECKED OFF YES OR NO WHERE THEY FELL OUT -- TO DEPRESSION. ONE TO FIVE BECAUSE A CHILD IS BRAND NEW TO THE SYSTEM THEY MAY NOT BE FORTHCOMING WHEN YOU'RE ASKING JUST THOSE SIMPLE SCREENING QUESTIONS VERSES LOOKING AT THE CHILD IN THE WHOLE PICTURE. BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY SERVING THE WHOLE CHILD NOT JUST TWENTY SIMPLE SCREENING QUESTIONS. CONTROL THANK YOU COUNTY -- AS FAR AS SERVICES PROVIDED TO FOSTER YOUTH AND THEIR PARENTS. AS YOU ALL KNOW TITLE FOR EASY CANNOT BE USED TO SERVE. FOR SERVICES SUCH AS MENTAL HEALTH SO WE RELY ON OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOR FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE SERVICES NEEDED FOR YOUTH AND THE COMMUNITY SERVICE PROVIDERS TO SERVE THEIR PARENTS. IN SHASTA WE ARE ABLE TO USE EPS D. T. OR MHSAA FUNDING TO PROVIDE A WIDE RANGE OF EVIDENCE BASED. AND SUPPORT OF THERAPIES FOR CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS. SOME EXAMPLES OF THIS ARE WE HAVE AN EIGHT WEEK PARENT ENGAGEMENT FORCE THAT IS RAN BY MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS AND A DRUG AND ALCOHOL COUNSELOR. THIS IS USED TO SERVE PARENTS WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THEIR CARE TO ORIENT TAKE THEM TO CHILD WELFARE. TO ASSESS THEIR NEEDS. MAKE REFERRALS TO COMMUNITY PROVIDERS AND ADDRESS THEIR TRAUMA. WE HAVE A POSITIVE PARENTING PROGRAM TO SUPPORT AN INCREASE IN PARENTING SKILLS WHILE ADDRESSING THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF BOTH THE PARENTS AND FOSTER YOUTH. WE USE A ZERO FIVE CLINICIAN TO WORK WITH NEW PARENTS AND RESOURCE FAMILIES THAT SPECIALIZE IN THIS VERY VULNERABLE POPULATION. WE HAVE CLINICIANS AN ORGANIZATIONAL PROVIDERS. THAT WE FIND IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE INDIVIDUAL THERAPY IN HOME BEHAVIORAL SUPPORT INTENSIVE CASE COORDINATION AND FAMILY THERAPY THAT'S NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS. WHEN MOVING FROM FAMILY REUNIFICATION TO FAMILY MAINTENANCE WE HAVE CLINICIANS TO HELP SUPPORT? THE KIDS TRANSITIONING BACK HOME OR YOU MAY DECIDE TO USE OUR WRAPAROUND TEAM IN ORDER TO ASSESS THAT TRANSITION AND ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE ENTIRE FAMILY. WE ALSO HAVE CASE SAFE CARE TO THAT SERVES CHILDREN ZERO TO SIX AND THEIR FAMILIES TO INCREASE PARENTING KNOWLEDGE WHILE ADDRESSING HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES OF THE CHILDREN. OUR SOCIAL WORKERS AND CLINICIANS COLLABORATE. IN SHASTA. BY HAVING A MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIAN AND DRUG AND ALCOHOL COUNSELOR SIT WITH THE INVESTIGATION DIVISION CASE STAFF MEANS TO BRING THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND PERSPECTIVE TO THE TABLE. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE NEXT STEPS IN AN INVESTIGATION AS PULP AS PART OF A MULTI DISCIPLINARY APPROACH. WE ALSO HAVE CLINICIANS THAT ARE CO LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE CHILD WELFARE DIVISION. SO TO INCREASE COMMUNICATION AND SERVICES TO YOUTH ON CASE SPECIFIC NEEDS. WHICH IS VERY HELPFUL AND SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE IN ALL COUNTIES. SO WHAT DO COUNTIES NEED TO EFFECTIVELY SERVE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ESPECIALLY UNDER C. C. R.. WE NEED TRUE SHARED LEADERSHIP FROM THE TO STATE DEPARTMENTS FOR MEANING THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF CHILDREN YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES. IN CONSISTENT COMMUNICATION HAS A RIPPLE EFFECT ON LOCAL AGENCIES AND I SEE THIS FIRST HAND AS THE DIRECTOR FROM BOTH PROGRAMS. AND THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. FOR EXAMPLE BOTH STATE DEPARTMENTS SK FOR SCREENING DATA FROM THE TWO COUNTY DEPARTMENTS. THIS WAS DUE ON THE SAME DAY WITH DIFFERENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. CANS IMPLEMENTATION VERY LITTLE THOUGHT TO COORDINATING IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES MEANS DIFFERENT REPORTING DIFFERENT SETS OF QUESTIONS DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS. AND EVEN THOUGH WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE USING THE CANS TO WORK TOGETHER. WE NEED A COORDINATED DATA SYSTEM AT A MINIMUM. SO THAT WE CAN JOINTLY TRACK THE INFORMATION. ON THE YOUTH TO MAKE PROGRAM DECISIONS TO MEET THE CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES NEEDS. WE NEED STATE LEADERSHIP TOWARDS A MULTI GENERATIONAL APPROACH TO HEALING TRAUMA BOTH FOR CHILDREN YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES. I AM PLEASED TO PARTICIPATE ON THE AB THREE FORTY WORK GROUP LED BY DH CS THAT IS CONSIDERING VARIOUS TRAUMA SCREENS FOR ALL CHILDREN SERVED BY EPS D. T.. AND THAT WORK IS AN IMPORTANT START TO ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. WITHIN CHILD WELFARE WE WORK WITH FAMILIES IMPACTED BY A SUBSTANCE ABUSE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MENTAL ILLNESS IN THE HOME FAMILY SEPARATION. AND MMHM MULTI GENERATIONAL ABUSE AND NEGLECT. AS A CHILD WELFARE DIRECTOR AND CLINICIAN. I KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO BE TALKING ABOUT IN ADDRESSING ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. NOT ONLY THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BUT ALSO THE PARENTS IN ORDER TO BETTER SUPPORT AND PROTECT THE CHILDREN IN OUR COMMUNITIES. IT IS ONE THING TO SIMPLY IDENTIFY TRAUMA WE HAVE MUCH MORE WORK TO DO TO ENSURE THAT THOSE EXPOSED TO TRAUMA HAVE THEIR NEEDS ADDRESSED AND PREVENT FUTURE HARM. THANK YOU I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS. NO I JUST WANTED TO BUY GOODS AND TO MENTION THREE FORTY AND OUR OFFICE WAS THE AUTHOR OF IT -- HOW APPRECIATIVE I AM ROOF AND HOW IMPORTANT THE WORK IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILL IS EFFECTIVE AT THE? GRASSROOTS LEVEL. I WANTED TO IF I COULD HIGHLIGHT THE MULTI GENERATIONAL MODEL THAT YOU WERE SPEAKING TO WENT AND HIGHLIGHT WHAT THIS ADMINISTRATION DID DO WELL. IN INVESTING A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN TEN OF FUNDS TO GO AND HELP WITH -- HOME VISITING FOR OUR CAL WORKS RECIPIENTS FROM ZERO TO TWO AS WE START LOOKING TO HOW WE CAN MAKE THOSE MULTI GENERATIONAL CHANGE IT IS IT HAS TO START WITH OUR YOUNGEST. AND THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE AND LOOK TOWARDS THIS PROGRAM IS A WONDERFUL EXAMPLE. BUT WILL WANTS TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE VIEW YOU IF I CAN ON THE POSITIVE PARENTING PROGRAM. HOW IS THAT SCALABLE ARE THERE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OTHER COUNTIES TO LEARN FROM IT ARE THERE? OTHER CHANCES FOR PROGRAMS LIKE THAT TO BE BENEFICIAL AND AGAIN I'M JUST GONNA SAY. IT'S NOT EASY BEING A PARENT AND WE HAVE TO GIVE PEOPLE AS MANY TOOLS AS WE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER COOLEY. I ACTUALLY I'M GOING TO HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU AND ALSO KIM. BOTH ON THE TOPIC OF OTHER THINGS WE CAN DO TO STRENGTHEN WHAT HAPPENS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. A WE HEARD ABOUT THE ALL THE DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS AT WORK. SOCIAL EVENTS IN YOUR VIEW -- CAM ON ARE THE THINGS YOU CAN DO IMPROVE HOW THE SYSTEM FOR THE COUNTY LEVEL. AND FOR YOU DIANA I AWAY FROM THE STATE'S STANDPOINT WE CAN BE. SUPPORTING THE WORK YOU'RE DELIVERING AS FOR THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL. BY SUPPORTING EDUCATION OF YOUR COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS CITY OFFICIALS -- COUNTY MANAGERS CITY MANAGERS. IS THERE ANY ROLE. THAT THE STATE CAN SUPPORTS OF THE LOCAL LEADERSHIP. IN UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE ENCOUNTERING AND HOW RESOURCE CAN BE BROUGHT TO BEAR SO WHAT'S. YOUR ON THE FRONT LINES DELIVERING THINGS BUT YOU'RE IN A COUNTY BUDGET STRUCTURE. AND IS THERE A WAY IN WHICH THE STATE COULD BE ASSISTING WITH EDUCATION. PROMOTED IN PRIORITIES -- OPPORTUNITIES. FOR MORE SYNERGIES WITH THE MULTI DISCIPLINARY APPROACH DESCRIBE THAT SORT OF THING. SO IT IS SORT OF GENERALIZED THOUGHTS ON THAT SO NOT NECESSARILY STRICTLY SHASTA COUNTY YOU ALREADY. TALKED ABOUT VENTURE ANOTHER SHIFT YOUR PERSPECTIVE YOU WANT. OKAY. SO -- YEAH THERE'S JUST THERE'S ALWAYS THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH MONEY. AND WE KNOW THAT -- PROBABLY THE THE I THINK OF TO CHALLENGES ONE OF THEM IS THAT WE RELY HEAVILY ON MEDICAID FUNDING. AND WITH REALIGNMENT IS WHAT WE USE THEM USE FOR A MATCH FOR THE AND OF COURSE EVERYTHING COMES IN ARREARS THE ENTIRE MEDICAID SYSTEM FOR COUNTIES IS THAT YOU PROVIDE THIS SERVICE. YOU PAY THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO PROVIDED THE SERVICE THAT IS AS AS A CLINICIAN OR A THE AGENCY THAT THEY WORK FOR WHETHER IT'S THE COUNTY OR THE PRIVATE AGENCY -- GETS PAID THE PRIVATE AGENCY IS PAID AND THEY SUBMIT A CLAIM THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT SUBMITS A CLAIM. AND AND THEN WE'RE PAID IT'S ALWAYS REIMBURSEMENT. THERE'S A PACE THERE'S TIME LAG. AND SO MOST COUNTY DEPARTMENTS -- THERE OPERATE THEIR SERVICES IN ARREARS -- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDS COME AFTER THE FACT AND THAT'S RUNS ABOUT A TWO YEAR. AFTER THE FACT SO WHEN THE RECESSION HIT BACK BEING A DIRECTOR IN YOLO COUNTY. YOU KNOW THINGS WERE LOOKING OKAY IN AT IN THE MOMENT WHEN THE RECESSION HIT BECAUSE WE WERE STILL. UP YOU KNOW TWO YEARS BEHIND THAT BUT BOY WHEN THE UPSWING CAME WE WERE IN THE PIT. AND SO THAT'S REALLY TOUGH AND SO MOST OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OPERATE IN ARREARS. BUT NEW IDEAS COME FORWARD AND NEW IMPLEMENTATION SEIZE HERE IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF A OF A GOOD IDEA. AND REALLY BUILT ON THE INTENTION AND PLANNED GOAL OF MEDI CAL SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BEING PROVIDED TO OUR FOSTER YOUTH. THAT COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH SHOULD INCREASE THE SERVICES WHICH WILL OCCUR AND YOU HAVE TO PAY YOUR STAFF FIRST AND YOU HAVE TO PAY YOUR CONTRACTOR PROVIDERS FIRST AND THEN YOU CAN SUBMIT CLAIMS TO BE READ AND BURST. SO THAT'S A CHALLENGE JUST AN OVERALL GENERAL AND THAT'S THE THERE WERE A BUT THE FUNDING IS STILL LAGGING THE SPENDING AT THE LAGGED AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE THERE'S A TIME. I MEAN THERE'S A TIME LAG BY DESIGN OF THE SYSTEM. NOT NECESSARILY THERE SOMETIMES TIME LIKES WITH DH CS BUT MORE THAN THAT IT'S A SYSTEM DESIGNED BY TWO YEARS. WELL TWO YEARS IS THE MHSAA TIME LAG PLAN AND THAT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE FILE TAXES AFTER THE YEARS OVER. AND THEN AFTER THE YEARS OVER PEOPLE DO FILE GET EXTENSIONS. AND SO YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST THERE'S A TIME LAG THE AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET INTO THE WE'VE DONE THIS ONE BY IT WE HAD A VERY -- COLORFUL MEETING. ABOUT PROP SIXTY THREE FUNDING AND I BELIEVE ALL YOU ALL WERE IN IN THAT MEETING AND SOUL. IS THERE SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE THERE IS BACK MONEY LAYING AROUND THAT HASN'T BEEN REVERTED BACK TO WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO SO. WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS? THERE IS MONEY THERE YEAH WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT MONEY GETS. TO THE PROVIDER RIGHT MEDIA RIGHT AND SO I WOULD NEED TO GO BACK TO THE ASSOCIATION BECAUSE MY FORMAL ASSIGNMENT IS NOT THE FISCAL PIECE. AT SO WELL I KNOW MUCH OF IT I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF OUR FISCAL. FOLKS -- BUT WE CAN OUT WITH ABSOLUTELY LIKE TO HAVE A MEETING TO DISCUSS THAT BECAUSE THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH TIME LAG. AND THEN THE OTHER COMPONENT IS I'M NOT SURE THAT THE DESIGN C. C. R. WAS DESIGNED TO BE COST NEUTRAL BUT IT'S AN INCREASE IN SERVICES. AND SO THERE'S SOME ISSUES OF PROP THIRTY PARTICULARLY WITH CANS AND SOME OF THE OTHER SERVICES THAT. WE WILL BE REIMBURSED BUT THERE'S FORMULAS THEIR SET UP AND PROJECTED BUT THEY'RE DONE YEAR YOU KNOW BEFORE HAND AND NOW WE'RE IN IT. AND SO IT'S OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE IT CB HD WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH YOU ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU WELL AND THEN JUST TO YES. KIND OF OF ALONG THE SAME LINES -- I UNIT I KNOW YOU TALKED ABOUT -- TYPICALLY PROP SIXTY THREE MONEY BUT A YOU ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE TWO DEPARTMENTS. AND IF YOU'VE BEEN IN THE MEETINGS THAT WE WERE AND THAT WAS THE MAJOR PART OF MY FRUSTRATION BECAUSE EVEN HAVING THEM SITTING IN FRONT OF US THEY SAID THERE WAS A DISCONNECT RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. AND SO -- OBVIOUSLY THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW ADMINISTRATION BITE. TO PRE EMPT THAT. IS THERE A WAY THAT YOU CAN GIVE SOME SUGGESTIONS AND POP POSSIBLY HAVE MEETINGS WITH -- DOCTOR RANDALL I SIT AND SOMEONE AS WELL AND MISTER COOLEY JUST KIND OF OFF LINE -- TO CAN HELP AT LEAST FOR ME I'M ASKING FOR MYSELF I KNOW -- DOCTOR RAMBLE AND I HAVE DISCUSSED THIS MANY TIMES BUT WHAT. CAN WE DO TO PREEMPT THE NEW ADMINISTRATION ABOUT WHAT HOW WE CAN FIX IT AND I'M NOT. UNREALISTIC IT'S STILL GOVERNMENT IT'S NOT GONNA BE FIXED OVER NIGHT BUT IF YOU CAN GIVE US SOME SUGGESTIONS AS TO HOW WE CAN MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS BETTER I KNOW YOU TALKED ABOUT THE SYSTEMS BEING. COMPATIBLE -- HAVING ONE SYSTEM BUILDER IN MY OPINION PRETTY EASY FIX SAYS. BEING THAT -- IF THE WILL IS THERE THINGS THAT YOU SEE ARE NOT AS EASY THAT IS GOING TO TAKE US THAT ARE GOING TO TAKE US A COUPLE YEARS. THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT I'M INTERESTED IN BECAUSE WE CAN GET GRABBED THE ADMINISTRATION THE BEGINNING. AT ME MAYBE I'M IN FANTASY TO OF WORLD BY TO GRAB THEM IN THE BEGINNING AND AT LEAST TELL THEM THIS IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR WHETHER IT BE THE FOLLOWING YEAR OR TWO YEARS OR I MEAN. LET AT SOME POINT THIS IS WHAT WE NEED AND SO WE CAN START TALKING TO THE NEW ADMINISTRATION. I ABOUT THE SUGGESTION SO MORE HOMEWORK IF YOU CAN MEET WITH US. NUMBER ONE BUT NUMBER TWO IF YOU CAN. PUT DOWN ON PAPER WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU SEE THAT CAN BE FIXED THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY REQUIRE MONEY THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENTS COSTS NOTHING. SO THAT MONEY IS NOT AN EXCUSE SO THOSE THINGS THAT. DO NOT COST ANYTHING THAT ARE. PRETTY SIMPLE LIKE THE FORMS FOR EXAMPLE THE FORMULAS YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THE FORMS IN THE FORMULAS IF WE CAN FIX THOSE FORMS THAT BECAUSE CUT DOESN'T COST ANY MONEY. IT'S ABOUT STREAMLINING AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE DEPARTMENTS COMMUNICATE WITH THEMSELVES SO. THAT'S THE HOMEWORK -- OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR IT BUT THAT'S MY ASK OF YOU AND I AM AVAILABLE -- YOU KNOW I BASICALLY AT ANY TIME THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AND I'LL HAVE MY MY FOLKS REACH OUT TO YOU AS WELL. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. COMMENTS OR FOLLOW UP YEAH [inaudible] SO. MY ONLY EXPERIENCE IS IT WITHIN SHASTA COUNTY AND SO WALL I HAVE A HAVE A GREAT -- CHAU -- AT THE COUNTY LEVEL WHO'S VERY SUPPORTIVE OF FOSTER YOUTH IN THE WORK THAT WE DO WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT -- IN THERE ARE A COUPLE OF BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND THAT ARE VERY INVESTED IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- TO CHILDREN -- AND SPECIFICALLY. SO I I FEEL SUPPORTED THEIR WHAT HAPPENS THOUGH IS THAT IF WE ARE NOT GIVEN SPECIFIC MONEY FOR THE INITIATIVES THAT COME DOWN OR THE EXPECTATION THE WORK THAT'S DONE -- ALL OUR GENERAL FRIENDS REALLY GOES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. OF AND SO THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE RUN INTO AND SO WE OFTEN HAVE THIS DISCUSSION ARE WE GOING TO AB IT'S IT'S HONESTLY MY CEOS -- LITTLE METAPHORS THAT HE GIVES ABOUT PREVENTION YOU KNOW WE COULD EITHER STANDARD A CLIFF AND LOOK AT THE CAR THAT JUST WENT OVER THE EDGE AND CRASH AND HAVE TO GO DOWN WITH THE AMBULANCE. OR WE CAN BEGIN TO PUT UP A FENCE THAT'S GOING TO KEEP THAT CAR FROM GOING OVER AND SO IF WE DON'T START DOING SOMETHING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES AT THE CHILDREN'S LEVEL -- THEN WE ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE IN THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING AND SO I DO FEEL SUPPORTED BUT AGAIN FUNDING HAS TO COME SPECIFICALLY TO OUR PROGRAMS. IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO USE IT BECAUSE OTHERWISE CHEN OFFENSE REALLY DOES GO TO LAW ENFORCEMENT RIGHT AND ALSO JUST -- WE TALKED ABOUT PROP SIXTY THREE MONEY I AND AND I KNOW THAT THAT YOU GAVE US THE INFORMATION BUT THERE WAS NO SPECIFICS AS TO WHY WHAT. PROP SIXTY THREE MONEY SHOULD BE USED FOR AND IF WE DON'T GIVE UP THE COUNTIES SPECIFIC DIRECTIONS ARE GOING TO USE THAT. FOR WHATEVER IT IS THAT. CAN I MAKE THIS THING AT THE TIME CAN I JUST ADD JUST HAVING BEEN AT THE COUNTY FOR SO MANY YEARS. THE OTHER PIECE THAT HAPPENS IS WHEN SERVICES ARE SUCCESSFULLY PROVIDED. AND CHILDREN IN YOU ADULTS AS WELL. ARE SERVED AND THERE'S A CHANGE. THE COST AVOIDANCE AND COST SAVINGS RARELY IF AT ALL GET FILTERED BACK TO THE PROGRAM THAT WAS SUCCESSFUL IN MAKING THAT CHANGE. AND SO THEN IT'S BECAUSE IF WE DECREASE THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN JUVENILE HALL. IF WE DECREASE HOSPITAL BED DAYS IF WE'D DECREASE THE NUMBER OF CALLS TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THERE'S LESS BREAK INS. THOSE DOLLARS DON'T TURN AROUND TO THE PROGRAM THAT SUCCESSFULLY PROVIDED THOSE SERVICES PROVIDED TBS BY A COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDER WHO THE CHILD NO LONGER BREAKS INTO A STORE ANYMORE. THOSE DON'T COME BACK AND SO. IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT A WAY TO ADDRESS THAT AND KEEP THAT GOING BACK INTO THE SYSTEM THAT WOULD BE AMAZING. LIKE IT'S HAPPENING TO US TWO OF MY MY BY IT BUDGET YEAR IS ENDING AND I DIDN'T USE ALL OF MY FUNDS AND GUESS WHAT HAPPENS I GET TO LOSE THEM. AND SO A LOT OF PEOPLE AND I KNOW I WAS A TEACHER AS WELL AND WHEN WHEN WE DON'T USE THEM IT WAS A USING MY NEWSHAM. WE'RE ALL BUSY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SPEND THE MONEY INSTEAD OF SAVING IT FOR A RAINY DAY AND AND KEEPING IT FOR FOR OTHER SERVICES THAT CAN BE PROVIDED SO. I THINK WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME SITUATION AND I THINK THAT'S KIND OF A GOVERNMENTAL MENTALITY THAT HOPEFULLY WE CAN BREAK THERE AND AND TRY. TO WE CAPTURED ALSO THAT YOU CAN INCREASE YOUR PROGRAMS OR EXPANDING WITH AND YOU KNOW THE THE COMMUNITY THAT YOU START OF SELF. THANK YOU. K. ANY OTHER. YOU KNOW WE'VE TAKEN ON VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- SO WE HAVE DEBORAH DEBORAH AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME AND SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. I WAS ASKED TO EXPLAIN TO YOU THE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY -- IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH OUR SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT INDICATING A LAWSUIT -- SO IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AS STRATEGIC PLAN WAS INITIATED WHICH CODIFY THE CRITERIA FAR EXIT FROM THAT LAWSUIT. SAID THESE CONDITIONS SPECIFIED SEVERAL THINGS SYSTEMATIC SCREENING AND ASSESSMENT OF ALL YOUTH. DEVELOPMENT OF A COLLABORATIVE MODEL BETWEEN DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH KNOWN AS A COORDINATED SERVICES ACTION TEAM OR SEE SAT. IMPLEMENTATION OF A SHARED COR PRACTICE MODEL AND EXIT CRITERIA WHICH INCLUDE PASSING SCORES ON A QUALITATIVE SERVICE REVIEW. US RUN NOT QUITE THERE YET BUT WE'RE WORKING ON IT. THE FRONT END IN TAKEN LINKAGE SYSTEM HAVE BEEN FORMALIZED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. AND BOTH AGENCIES HAVE DEDICATED STAFF TO COORDINATE AND SUPPORT THE PROCESS. THAT SO THE WAY IT WORKS IS -- IN OUR SYSTEM THAT -- THE CASE CARING SOCIAL WORKER COMPLETES A MENTAL HEALTH SCREENING TOOL FOR EVERY CHILD WHO'S REFERRAL IS PROMOTED TO A CASE -- THE MENTAL HEALTH SCREENING TOOL IS -- BEHAVIORAL CHECKLIST DESIGNED FOR NON MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS SO QUESTIONS INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE. IT DOES THE CHILD APPEAR TO BE DISCONNECTED ÍEXCESSIVELY PASSIVE AS WELL AS HAS A CHILD EXPERIENCED OR WITNESSED PHYSICAL AND OR SEXUAL ABUSE OR SEVERE NEGLECTED TO BEHAVIORAL CHECKLIST. SO IT MOST MENTAL HEALTH SCREENINGS ARE POSITIVE. DUE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT BROUGHT THAT CHILD TO OUR ATTENTION AND ANY NEGATIVE SCREENS ALTHOUGH THERE RARE ARE DOCUMENTED AND REQUIRE AN ANNUAL REASSESSMENT. IS SO THE MEANT THE MENTAL HEALTH SCREENING TOOL WITH SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION IS ELECTRONICALLY FORWARDED TO OUR COLOCATED MENTAL HEALTH STAFF -- LOCATED EACH REGIONAL OFFICE SO THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED SUCH STAFF -- WHO SERVE THAT FUNCTION IN LOS ANGELES? COLOCATED MENTAL HEALTH HEALTH STAFF REVIEW EACH SCREENING TOOL. AND THEY MAKE A DETERMINATION OF ACUITY. AYE CHILDREN WHOSE NEEDS ARE DEEMED A CUTE OR URGENT ARE IMMEDIATELY LINKED TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND NEWLY DETAIN CHILDREN WHOSE NEEDS ARE DEEMED A ROUTINE ARE REFERRED FOR A MULTI DISCIPLINARY ASSESSMENT TEAM ARM MATT ASSESSMENT WITHIN TEN DAYS OF REFERRAL. I'M SO AND NINETY TEEN CHILDREN ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MAD ASSESSMENT AND FEAR REFER TO CO LOCATED STAFFER ASSESSMENT AND THEN LINKAGES WELL. AS SO THE MAD ASSESSMENT I THINK IS IS UNIQUE TO THE COUNTY AND IT ADDRESSES MENTAL HEALTH BEHAVIORAL. AND DEVELOPMENTAL ISSUES AS A WHILE AS CHILD AND FAMILY STRENGTHS IN NEEDS -- IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE HAVE FORTY EIGHT MATT AGENCIES AND THEY COMPLETE AROUND SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED MATT ASSESSMENTS PER YEAR -- ABOUT FOURTEEN MILLION MEDI CAL DOLLARS ARE ALLOCATED TO THIS PROGRAM AS WELL DCFS PAYS THREE AND A HALF MILLION FOR THEIR SUMMARY OF FINDINGS REPORT -- AND THE MATTER SAYS ARE BY THE WAY MAY REFER THE CHILD FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- AT ANY TIME DURING THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS WHICH TAKES -- THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE DAYS -- TRADITIONALLY THE SUMMARY OF FINDINGS RESULTS WERE PRESENTED AT KIND OF A STANDALONE MEETING -- WE BEGAN TO NOTICE POOR ATTENDANCE AT THOSE MEETINGS AND POOR INTEGRATION OF MATT FINDINGS INTO CASE PLANNING. SO WE INITIATED A MAT CF TO PILOT IN FOUR REGIONAL OFFICES -- IN IN THE PILOT THE ASSIGNED MATT ASSESSOR ATTENDS CHILD AND EXCUSE ME IS IT TENDS FAMILY AND STAFF ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. AND THEN THEY PARTICIPATE IN THE FIRST CHILD -- AND THERE THEY SHARE AND TRANSLATE THEIR FINDINGS FOR THE FAMILY AND THE TEAM -- SO WE ADJUSTED THE CHARTING STRATEGIES A BIT FOR CHILD AND FAMILY TEAM MEETINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MATT FINDINGS REINCORPORATED. INTO THE SEA IF THE ACTION PLAN BECAUSE THE CFT ACTION PLAN IS CARRIED FORWARD WITH THE CHILD THROUGHOUT THE LIFE OF THE CASE -- AND SO THIS IS REALLY IMPROVE THE FAMILY SENSE OF AGENCY -- IN REGARDS TO THE MAT ASSESSMENT FINDINGS AT HAS HELPED WE FOUND INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE USEFUL AND RELEVANT CASE PLANS. SO WE'VE COMPLETED MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MATT ASSESSMENTS IN THIS WAY -- THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TO BE EXACT -- WITH THIS NEW PROTOCOL AND WE WE'VE RECEIVED VERY POSITIVE FEEDBACK FROM CHILDREN AND FAMILIES SO NOW WE'RE PREPARING FOR ROLLOUT INTO ADDITIONAL OFFICES. THE KIND OF ON A GRANULAR LEVEL OR DOING LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THE CHALLENGES -- THAT WE HAVE IN LA -- IT IS THE SIZE JUST THE SHEER SIZE OF THE OPERATION. ARM RIGHT NOW -- WE HAVE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND CHILDREN IN CARE -- OVERSEEN BY FORTY TWO HUNDRED SOCIAL WORKERS ACROSS TWENTY TWENTY ONE REGIONAL OFFICES. IS AN ENORMOUS OPERATION IT'S IT'S NOT EASY TO GET EVERYONE ALIGNED IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALL THE TIME THAT'S ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES. THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT THANK YOU -- AND SO I THINK. A BIGGER CHALLENGE -- AT RELATED TO IT CAT TO RENO WAS SAYING TO IS ALTHOUGH THE FRONT END WORKS EFFICIENTLY IN THE WAY THAT I'VE DESCRIBED -- I DO THINK WE EXPERIENCE GAPS SUBSEQUENT TO THAT INITIAL SCREENING ASSESSMENT AND LINKAGE -- ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT I WE FIND IS THAT THERE'S REALLY NO CENTRAL DE MH DATA SYSTEM. THAT LONGITUDINALLY TRACKS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE LINKAGE -- SO WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF ANY INDIVIDUAL CHILD'S TRAJECTORY IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. AND BECAUSE WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT TRAJECTORY WE REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP GOOD STRATEGIES. TO ENSURE CONTINUITY OF TREATMENT WHEN A CHILD IS REPLACED OR TO EVEN PRO ACTIVELY RESPOND -- TO ANY ESCALATED MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS IN AN EFFORT TO AVOID REPLACEMENT THAT'S OUR GOAL -- SO. IN CONCLUSION I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT WE CARE ABOUT THESE CHILDREN VERY MUCH. AND ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR PARTNERS AND COLLEAGUES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH TO MAKE SURE THEY GET WHAT THEY NEED. YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS QUESTION. AND IS IN THE WAKE OF THE KD OF LITIGATION. IT IS THAT'S FAR OF A IMPETUS TO THAT'S FOR A LONGITUDINAL TRACKING SYSTEM. I MEAN OF JUST. EIGHT K?T A REQUIRED AS TO YOU KNOW TO ENSURE ADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR THESE CHILDREN AND I THINK THAT WE ARE ARE FOCUSED A LOT ON SOME TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF IT AS WELL AS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CORE PRACTICE MODEL BUT NO THE LONGITUDINAL TRACKING. IS SOMETHING NOW THAT WE'RE SEEING STEP YEAH AND I DO WANT TO SAY WHEN I SAID IT'S HARD. TO GET EVERYONE A LINE. I'VE MADE IT SOUND LIKE A JOKE BUT ACTUALLY I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS VERY PRACTICAL OBSERVATION. THAT IN ALL ITS WANTING TO MOVE A SINGLE BATTLE SHIP IT'S ANOTHER THING TO MOVE A WHOLE FLEET -- SO I JUST. I FELT YOU WERE JUST BEING VERY PRACTICAL SAYING. NEXT TIME YEAH AND I DIDN'T MEAN. TO IN ANY WAY IMPLY THAT THAT WAS OUT OF THE ORDINARY ACTUALLY THANK YOU THINGS TAKE TIME YEAH THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. CAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND SO NEXT WE HAVE LARA HINES. HI A GOOD AFTERNOON I'M IN A KIND OF A JUSTICE [inaudible] RIGHT CELL. BUT NINE FIVE THANK YOU FOR HAVING MADE -- THIS IS VERY EXCITING TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE OF FIRST HAND INFORMATION TO YOU -- I WOULD LOVE TO ACTUALLY DO THE SAME THING WITH OUR POOR SUPERVISORS AT A LOCAL LEVEL. BECAUSE THIS IS VERY COMPLICATED WORK -- AND PROBABLY MORE NOT IN AT EVERY DAY SELL -- I AM A DOCTOR LARA HEIGHT CEO OF STAMFORD YOU SOLUTIONS WE ARE RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO -- FOUNDED RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET ON EIGHT THE MAN AT THE STANFORD MANSION AT STANFORD HOME FOR CHILDREN IN NINETEEN HUNDRED AS AN ORPHANAGE. WE HAVE EVOLVED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER TIME -- WE NO LONGER HAVE ANY CONCRETE CARE SO OUR COMMITMENT IS TO SERVE THE YOUTH -- IN THEIR HOMES OR IN FAMILY. WITH US SUPPORT OF OUR STAFF SO WE PROVIDE OF ROCK OF VARIETY OF COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. THAT -- WERE REFERENCED EARLIER -- ONE IS WRAPPED AROUND A WRAPAROUND A TRADITIONALLY WE'VE UTILIZED IT HERE IN SACRAMENTO AS A SERVICE TO BASICALLY MOVE CHILDREN FROM GROUP HOMES INTO BACK INTO COMMUNITY. MANY OF OUR WRAPAROUND CHILDREN OUR INTENTION IS FOR THEM TO RETURN TO SOME SORT OF FAMILY -- CAN SOMETIMES BIRTH FAMILY -- IF WE CAN'T DO THAT WE ALSO SUPPORT THEM IN FOSTER CARE FOSTER HOMES. BUT WITH ALL OF OUR YOUTH OUR PRIMARY FOCUS IS PERMANENCY. SO THAT'S BEFORE C. C. R. EXIST OUR COMMITMENT. OF WE KNOW THAT ALL OF US -- GROW BEST AND FAMILY AND EVERYONE EVERY HUMAN BEING NEEDS A SENSE OF BELONGING CAM AND CONNECTION SO THAT'S OUR FOCUS ON WE HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE TO ALSO BE ABLE TO DO PREVENTION WRAPAROUND. WHICH IS -- WHEN A CHILD IS IDENTIFIED AS? IN AT RISK OF ENTERING -- AND WE'RE USING -- ACTUALLY TILED TITLE FORTY DOLLARS AND IT IS PRIMARILY OUR PROBATION USES SO THEY'RE OFTEN ARE PLACED ON A STATE MANY PEOPLE AREN'T AWARE OF THAT BUT MANY PROBATION YOUTH. FROM THIS AREA ARE PRE PLACE OUT OF STATE INST INSTEAD OF DOING NOT -- THERE -- WORKING WITH THE FAMILY SYSTEM WE HAVE REALLY HIGH SUCCESS RATES WITH THOSE ON THOSE AT THAT POPULATION BECAUSE IT'S EARLIER. IN -- IN KIND OF THE TRAUMA. OCCURRENCE SIR THOMAS CYCLE -- THAT IS IT'S ABOUT THREE TO FOUR MONTHS -- AND OVER 90% OF OUR CHILDREN ARE ABLE TO STABILIZE IN PREVENTION OR APPLE ROUND WE ARE AT RISK OF LOSING THOSE FUNDS WITH THE FORTY WAIVER. CHANGES SO OF WE ALSO HAVE FLEXIBLE INTEGRATED TREATMENT WHICH IS. TYPICALLY OUTPATIENT SERVICES THOSE ARE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY WE DO FAMILY INDIVIDUAL GROUP SERVICES -- MOST OF OUR YOUTH ARE REFERRED -- WHO HAVE BEEN IN AND OUT OF PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALIZATION AND ARE AT RISK OF HIGHER LEVEL OF KERR -- SO THAT'S ANOTHER PROGRAM WE ALSO DO TVS THERAPEUTIC BEHAVIORAL SERVICES THOSE SERVICES ARE DELIVERED UP WHERE THE CHILD HAS HIGH RISK OF BASICALLY LOSING THEIR PLACEMENT SO IT MAY BE IN SCHOOL. SO THEY MAY BE AT RISK OF GETTING KICKED OUT OF THE SCHOOL WILL DO TARGETED -- VERY TARGETED ON THE BEHAVIOR THAT PUTS THEM AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR PLACEMENT IT MAY BE IN A HOME. IT IT COULD BE IN A GROUP HOME SO THERAPEUTIC BEHAVIORAL SUCH SERVICES ARE DELIVERED WHEREVER THAT CHILD IS AT RISK OF LOSING PLACEMENT. THAT IS ALSO VERY SHORT TERM ABOUT THREE MONTHS -- ACTUALLY ON AVERAGE OURS IS SEVENTY DAYS OF SERVICE AND WE HAVE 92% PLACEMENT STABLE AT THE STABILITY AND THAT -- PROGRAM DELIVERY MODEL WE ALSO DO FUNCTIONAL FAMILY THERAPY -- THAT IS SPECIFIC TO OUR JUVENILE JUSTICE POPULATION OR PROBATION YOUTH AND WHAT THAT REQUIRES WORK WITH THE WHOLE FAMILY SYSTEM. AND THOSE YOUTH -- OUR PHONE BASICALLY WE WE CAN'T START FUNCTIONAL FAMILY THERAPY UNTIL THEY'RE IN A FAMILY HOME AND WE WORK THE WHOLE FAMILY THAT LIVES IN THE HOME. PARTICIPATES IN A FUNCTIONAL FAMILY THERAPY AND IT LASTS APPROXIMATELY SIXTEEN WEEKS AND IT'S EVIDENCE BASED. ON WE ALSO PROVIDE SCHOOL SERVICES -- WE DO A MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WE DO SOME TELEPHONE BE FOR YOUTH THAT ARE IN A NONTRADITIONAL EDUCATIONAL. SETTINGS ON AND EMBEDDED IN ALL OF THE WORK WE DO IS FAMILY AND YOUTH PARTNERSHIP. WE ACTUALLY HAVE A DEPARTMENT FOCUSED ON NOT -- BECAUSE WE KNOW -- THE FAMILY AND YOUTH VOICE IS CRITICAL TO THE WORK WE DO. AND TO THE SUCCESS THE ONGOING SUCCESS AFTER THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE FAMILY IS BASICALLY STOP SERVICES WITH US SO WE WANT TO REALLY IN BAD THE SKILLS THEY LEARNED THROUGH OUR THROUGH OUR SERVICES. AND THEY CONTINUED TO DO THE WORK AFTER US AND THEY ALSO ADVOCATE SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE IS AN EMPOWERMENT TRAIN CENTER. IT'S ACTUALLY FUNDED THROUGH US PAD -- THAT WE TRAINED FAMILY ADVOCATES FOR PERRIN ADVOCATES AND YOUTH ADVOCATES TO DO THE WORK NOT JUST IN OUR PROGRAMS BUT ACROSS THE REGION. I THE OTHER THING WE HAVE IDENTIFIED BECAUSE STAFF RETENTION HAS BEEN A REAL CHALLENGE FOR US -- CgA QUALIFIED STAFF AND STAFF THAT EVEN WANT TO DO THE HARD WORK OF GOING INTO FAMILIES TWENTY FOUR SEVEN <u>NG CALL</u> BECAUSE WE DO HAVE AN ON CALL COMPONENT TO THE WORK WE DO. ON THOSE FOR PATHWAYS ON AND THAT'S ALSO FUNDED THROUGH OFSHE HAD WERE WERE IDENTIFYING -- COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THE WORK AND WE TRAIN THEM AND THEY GET THEIR INTERNSHIP HOURS AND EXPERIENCE -- AT OUR PROGRAM AND HOPEFULLY THEY STAY WITH US HUH OR OR THERE IS SOME STAY WITH US AND SOME DECIDE YOU KNOW BUT MAYBE IT ISN'T THE RIGHT FIT FOR THEM. BUT ULTIMATELY THEY WILL HAVE GROWN THROUGH THE PROCESS AND MOST HAVE ACTUALLY WANTED TO STAY IN THE FIELD SO THAT'S REALLY POSITIVE -- BUT THAT'S VERY NEW THAT'S OUR SECOND YEAR OF DOING THE CAREER PATHWAYS -- WE ALSO DO SOMETHING CALLED -- I'M SURE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH IT BECAUSE OF CCAR -- I SSE INTENSIVE SERVICES -- IF IT WAS AYE TSC SO IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME TO CHANGE MY LANGUAGE WE DID IT OF SEE FOR MANY YEARS -- SO IT'S INTENSIVE SERVICES FOSTER CARE -- AND WE ALSO DO STANDARD TREATMENT FOSTER CARE AND THOSE INTENSIVE SERVICES FOSTER YOUTH ARE TYPICALLY THOSE THAT OTHERWISE WOULD BE AND CONGREGATE CARE THEY HAVE HAD MULTIPLE PLACEMENTS -- REALLY STRUGGLED ON IN IN ANY PLACE THAT THEY'VE BEEN EN AND WE IDENTIFY -- PARENTS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE -- SO IT'S IT'S OFTEN SAID SPECIAL ED TEACHER OR A ON SOMEBODY THAT'S BEEN IN THE FIELD -- A LOT OF DIFFERENT FOLKS THAT -- NURSES ACTUALLY MAKE GREAT -- ANY MEDICAL PROVIDER OF A ON TEACHERS MAKE GREAT AT AYE SFC PARENTS -- WE ARE STRUGGLING OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES RECRUITING THIS THIS ON POPULATION. A LOT OF IT IS VERY HARD ON THE BEST WAY TO RECRUIT IS WORD OF MOUTH FROM OTHER FAMILIES -- AND WITH SOME OF THE CHANGES WITH C. C. R. WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN A REDUCTION OF PEOPLE EAGER TO JUMP ON BOARD SO THAT HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR US -- THERE ARE ALSO -- ONE OF OUR AREAS OF IDENTIFYING CAN AND SUPPORTING CAN IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY WITH C. C. R. BUT WE ARE JUST AT THE BABY STAGES OF REALLY PROVIDING THE SAME LEVEL I'M TALKING ABOUT THE SYSTEM. SAME LEVEL OF SUPPORT TO THE CAN FAMILIES IDENTIFYING THEM ENSURING THAT THEY ARE TREATED ON WITH THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED TO SUPPORT. THOSE PHOSTRIA IF. I'M I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CHILD FAMILY TEAMING JUST BRIEFLY IT IS IN ALL OF OUR DECISION MAKING PROCESS IT'S BEEN EMBEDDED IN OUR PROGRAMS. SINCE WE STARTED WRAPAROUND MANY YEARS AGO -- WITH IT REQUIRES PROPER FACILITATION AND THE ASSURANCE THAT THAT YOUTH VOICE AND THE PARENT VOICE ARE AT THE TABLE. WE ACTUALLY REQUIRE THAT THERE'S A YOU HAD THE PRESIDENT PROFESSIONALS CAN INTIMIDATE BOTH THE THE PICK THE PARENT AND THE YOUNG PERSON. AND WE WANT SOMEONE THAT'S BASICALLY SUPPORTING THEM IN THEIR VOICE IN THE WORK WHAT DECISIONS ARE MADE IN THE C. F. T. ARE TO BE HONORED AND THAT'S AN EXPECTATION THE FEAR IS. THAT THOSE DECISIONS ARE AND DONE AFTER OUTSIDE OF THE C. F. T.. WE ALSO -- HAD A UNDERSTANDING THAT THE LEVEL OF CARE COULD BE ON BASICALLY REVIEWED LEVEL OF CARE PLACEMENT FOR A FOSTER YOUTH. IN THE C. F. T. AND NOT IS A CONCERN THAT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY HAPPENING THAT WAY AND PARENTS AND ESPECIALLY THE PARENTS ARE LEFT OUT OF THAT DISCUSSION -- SO WE ARE IN THE BABY STEPS OF THAT BUT THAT'S ALSO A CONCERN AND THEN -- AYE ALREADY TOUCHED ON ON THE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF FOSTER PARENTS ONE THING THAT WE ARE DOING -- IS IDENTIFYING MENTOR PARENTS. THAT SUPPORT OTHER -- FOSTER PARENTS IN THE WORK WE DO OBVIOUSLY WE TRAIN AMEND TRAUMA INFORMED WORK AND PRESENTING PROBLEMS THAT THE YOUTH HAVE AND THAT THAT BEHAVIORS ARE NOT NECESSARILY. BECAUSE OF THE ANYTHING PERSONAL BETWEEN THE FOSTER PARENT AND THE FOSTER YOUTH BUT BECAUSE OF A REACTION -- TO ETCETERA -- TRAINING PARENTS TO UNDERSTAND THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN THE EMOTIONAL RESPONSE THAT OCCURS WHEN YOU'RE RAISING A CHILD THAT'S SCREAMING AT YOU ARE THROWING SOMETHING OUT YOU OR DAMAGING. YOUR PRIZE VEHICLE OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW SO THAT IS AN ONGOING WORK AND THE MENTOR PARENTS HAVE SERVED A REALLY REALLY KEY ROLE THAT SAY SOME OTHER. OF US YOU KNOW -- HAVE A HARD TIME DOING BECAUSE WE CAN'T NECESSARILY SAY WELL MY KID DID THAT TOO EVEN IF WE DID YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY DEAD BUT IT IS REALLY HELPFUL WHEN A FOSTER PARENT SAYS I'VE BEEN THERE. YEAH SO -- ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HEARD WAS WE'VE HAD SOME. OF GROWTH. THERE'S BIRTH NUMBERS AND OUR MENTAL HEALTH DOLLARS THOSE AREN'T GETTING PASS IT DOWN TO THE DIRECT SERVICE AND I KNOW THAT THINGS COST MORE AND ALL LEVELS. BUT ESSENTIALLY WHEN WE ON ARE ASKED TO DELIVER THE SAME AMOUNT OF SERVICES OVER AND YEARS AND YEARS THE COSTS GO UP IT BECOMES MORE DEMANDING FOR US TO DELIVER THE SAME LEVEL OF SERVICES IN THE SAME QUALITY -- AND SO THERE IS A CONCERN BECAUSE I I BELIEVE EVEN IN OUR ON OUR OUR COUNTY THE PENETRATION RATE THE AMOUNT OF CHILDREN. GETTING SERVICES AND RELATIONS SO THAT SIGN THAT I DO HAVE -- THAT I JUST WANT TO BRING UP WHEN I HEARD THAT GROWTH HEADACHE INCREASED. THANK YOU AND JUST A SIDE COMMENT I WAS A TEACHER AND AND YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL EXCITED ABOUT ALL THE MONEY THAT'S GOING BACK TO THE SCHOOLS GOING BACK TO THE SCHOOLS AND IT REALLY IS NOT MAKING IT INTO THE CLASSROOM. AND SO I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT IN ALL OF OUR SALARIES GOING UP -- IT'S GOING TO DEFINITELY IMPACT -- THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE TRYING TO RECRUIT JUST BASIC FOLKS FOR BASIC SERVICES SO I APPRECIATE THE COMMENT DON'T BE AFRAID TO SAY TO MAKE THOSE COMMENTS BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE REASON THAT WE'RE HERE. IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HEAR THEM BECAUSE I THINK WHAT HAPPENED SOMETIMES FOLKS IN THESE TYPES OF HEARINGS AND IN THE SUB ONE HEARING THEY'RE FREE TO TELL US THE TRUTH AND THE REASON THAT WE'RE HERE IS. TO BE TOLD THE TRUTH BECAUSE IF WE LEAVE HERE THINKING THAT EVERYTHING'S FINE THEN WHY ARE WE HERE. AND SO SOUL IF YOU CAN IF YOU CAN JUST BE REALLY STRAIGHT AND HONEST ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT ON THIS WE KNOW WE STILL MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO MUCH ABOUT IT. BUT AT LEAST WE KNOW THAT THOSE ARE THE ISSUES AND WE CAN AT LEAST WORK TOWARDS -- A RESOLUTION FOR THAT ANY QUESTIONS OR ANY. COME LARGEST MAKE A COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS I THINK -- A LOT OF THESE TARGET AND SETTING QUESTIONS. IT BRINGS TO MIND JOHN KENNEDY WHO ONCE SAID THE GOVERNOR'S TO CHOOSE. YOU KNOW SO MUCH OF WHAT WE DO IS ACTUALLY CHOOSE AMONG ALTERNATIVES [inaudible] AND THINGS JUST SORT OF COME UP. AS I SIT HERE I ACTUALLY STARTED THE BUILDING THIS IS CRAZY MORE THAN FORTY ONE YEARS AGO. AND SINCE I'M A LAWYER I'VE DONE LOOK LET'S JUST A WAR CONTINUES IN VARIOUS SETTINGS ALL THAT. TIME. BUT MY FIRST BOSS SO THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT. NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT WHICH IS A NOT WHAT THIS AREA. BUT WAS SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. AND THE CHALLENGE OF RETAINING PEOPLE. THAT YOU NEEDED TO PROVIDE A SKILL LIBERAL LEVEL OF CARE. A MORE EXPERIENCED PEOPLE THE ONE ACTUALLY DO THE BEST AND DELIVERING IT. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE WORKED IN WAY BACK THEN WAS -- FIND IN A WAY TO PROVIDE STATE DOLLARS TO BACK FILL IN SUPPORT WHAT THEY WERE PAID. TO A VITAL BETTER THAN INCOME ADVANTAGE. I I'M JUST SAYING OKAY THAT'S THAT'S AN IDEA TO DEAL WITH RETENTION ISSUES AND HOW DO YOU KEEP QUALITY PEOPLE THERE SO MAYBE THAT'S IN SOME WAY SHAPE OR FORM AN IDEA. THINK ABOUT. OF THE OTHER ISSUE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO A. BE SEVENTEEN THIRTY THREE WE SET. IN AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. A BILL TO THE CURRENT GOVERNOR WAY BACK THEN. WHICH WAS DESIGNED TO SET ASIDE A MINIMUM OF FIFTY GRAND FOR EVERY. EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE. FOR CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION COURSE LA COUNTY GOT A BIG PILE OF MONEY. BUT THAT WAS THE FIRST SYSTEMATIC WAY TO TRY TO FIND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. A MULTI DISCIPLINARY LOCAL ENVISION APPROACHES FOR DEALING WITH CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION AND DEDICATED THE FUNDS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO THE LOCALS HAD. FUNDS TO WORK WITH. AND KERRY THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF PRIORITY SETTING FOR THE STATE LEVEL. TO KIND OF SAY WELL WE CAN GO UNDER SHASTA COUNTY AND LET THEM FASHION A SHASTA COUNTY SOLUTION. BECAUSE I WAS SUPPOSED TO KIDS IN CHESTER COUNTY. WHO WHO HAVE ISSUES? HAVE DIFFERENT ISSUES THE KIDS IN. ALAMEDA OR SAN RECESS COR LA OR SAN DIEGO. AND SO AGAIN I DO THINK THIS BRAINSTORMING. HOW DO WE TRANSLATE IDEALS AND POLICY IN AFFECTED PRIORITY SETTING? THAT SUPPORT GOOD OUTCOMES IN PEOPLE'S LIVES. AND I'M MORE SURE THESE OLD STORIES BECAUSE IT IT DOES RELATE TO WELL. WHAT WOULD BE A GOOD SOLUTION? AND THEN HOW DO WE GO ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE THAT SALE. SO THAT WE CAN CHOOSE TO GO ON THAT WAY. AND OF COURSE SURE YOU HAVE THE STANDING COMMITTEE CHAIR IN THE BUDGET CHAIR AND I SELECT COMMITTEE CHAIR ALL TOGETHER. SOUL. THANK YOU THANK YOU. RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS OKAY STEVE ELSON. WELL THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY -- I'M A DOCTOR STEVE EL SAN FROM CASA PACIFICA -- WE HAVE SERVICES IN VENTURA COUNTY AND IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY -- AND YOU NOTE JUST A WORD ABOUT -- THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM WHICH IS A MASSIVE CHANGE IN THE WAY IN WHICH WE WORK WITH KIDS IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM THAT REALLY IS. BEING CALLED ONCE IN A GENERATION PERFORM. AND I WANT A COMPLIMENT -- THE FOLKS IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES SERRA ROGERS GREG ROADS AND AND THEIR TEAMWHO'VE BEEN WORKING ON CC ARE IMPLEMENTATION AND I THINK THEY'VE. REALLY DEMONSTRATED A A STRONG -- EFFORT -- TO AT TRY TO IMPLEMENTED IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND BOTH THE YOUTH AND THE ISSUES ON THE GROUND AMONG THE PROVIDERS. SO -- ONE THING YOU KNOW WE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT MENTAL HEALTH FOLKS AND THE H. C. S. AND AND CHILD WELFARE SOCIAL SIR ONE THING THAT IT SEEMS TO ME COULD HELP. WOULD BE ELEVATING THE THE THE FOLKS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH TO LIKE A DEPUTY DIRECTOR LEVEL. THEY'RE SORT OF BURIED IN THAT -- BUREAUCRACY IN A DON'T I THINK HAVE THE GRAVITAS -- THAT THEY USED TO HAVE WON THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH WAS A ITS OWN -- DEPARTMENT WITH THE GOVERNOR APPOINTEE AS THE AS THE DIRECTOR SO THAT'S KIND OF AN ASIDE MY OWN PERSONAL VIEW. I WORD ABOUT CASA PACIFICA WE'VE BEEN -- SERVING SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN IN OUR REGION FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS. WE SERVE NOW ABOUT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED YOUTH A YEAR -- BY TWENTY INVENTOR AND SANTA BARBARA COUNTY MANY OF THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE OUR THOSE THAT A LARA. DESCRIBED -- WITH STANFORD -- WHAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON TODAY IS IS THE S. T. R. T. P. THE SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS KIND OF THE THE DEEP AND IT IS THE DEFENSE SERVICE? FOR KIDS YOUTH IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM WE HAVE A TWENTY FIVE ACRE CAMPUS. WE HAVE FORTY TWO S. T. R. T. P. BETS. THE INTENT OF THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM AND THE ROLE OF S. T. R. TWO PIECES TO REPLACE GROUPON'S. WE HEARD KATRINA TALK ABOUT GROUP HOMES THOSE ARE GOING AWAY. THAT'S THE INTENT OF THIS REFORM EFFORT DO AWAY WITH. A LONG TERM A GROUP HOMES AND TO CREATE -- A PROGRAMS AT THE HIGH END TWENTY FOUR SEVEN PROGRAMS THAT CAN PROVIDE TREATMENT. A SERVICES ON A SHORT TERM BASIS FOR KIDS WHO WHO REALLY NEED OF SERVICE SO WE HAVE FORTY TWO S. T. R. T. P. BEDS. AND WE HAVE TWENTY BEDS OF THAT WE NOW OFFER TO COMMERCIAL INSURANCE. OF FUNDED KIDS OF THESE TO BE -- EMPLOYER BASED INSURANCE KAISER ANTHEM BLUE CROSS -- AT CENTER SO WE WE HAVE THE I THINK UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO BOTH COMPARE THOSE POPULATIONS COMPARE RATES COMPARE. OF THE KINDS OF SERVICES THAT ARE BEING DEMANDED BY THE BY THE PAYERS -- SO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR EXPERIENCES HONEST YEAR TO PAY I THINK WE WERE THE THIRD STR KEEP THE IN THE STATE TO BE LICENSED AS MUCH WE'VE BEEN ASKED HERE TP. FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN MONTHS. ONCE WE WERE LICENSED REFERRALS TO OUR PROGRAM CHEST XCELERATED DRAMATICALLY. WE GET ON AVERAGE OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN MONTHS ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE REFERRALS A MONTH. TWO OUR STR TP WE SERVE BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS IN THOSE FORTY TWO BEDS. SOME MONTS WE'VE HAD OVER A HUNDRED REFERRALS. REFERRALS COME FROM ALL OVER THE STATE WE'VE HAD REFERRALS FROM FORTY DIFFERENT COUNTIES CENTS WE BECAME LICENSED. AN WE HAD MET KIDS FROM -- FROM ALL OVER THE STATE A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS SUCH. AS WELL AS SOUTHERN -- WHAT WE HEAR FROM COUNTY IS THAT IT THAT IT'S HARDER TO PLACE GIRLS WE HAVE MORE GIRLS? MORE GIRL BEDS THAN BOYS. WE GET REFERRALS FOR YOUTH UNDER TWELVE ALTHOUGH WE DON'T ADMIT THEM BUT TEN AND ELEVEN YEAR OLD REFERRALS COUNTIES -- DESPERATE TO FIND A PROGRAMS THAT WILL SERVE YOU HAVE. CHILDREN OF THAT AGE. WHAT WE SEE IS THAT THE PACKET REFERRALS THAT WE GET REALLY TEND TO FOCUS ON ON HOW? EXTREMELY HE ARE DAMAGED OTHER COMPLEX COMPLEX TRAUMA THAT THE KIDS HAVE EXPERIENCED HOW DIFFICULT THEIR BEHAVIORS ARE. THERE'S VERY LITTLE IN THOSE PACKETS ABOUT -- STRENGTHS ABOUT -- ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT THE THAT THE YOUTH HAVE HAVE HAD ABOUT WHAT IS REDEEMING. ABOUT THEM -- SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE RELY ON IS PERSONAL INTERVIEWS AMONG THOSE YOUTH ONCE WE SCREEN PACKETS AND THINK WE CAN HELP OUR YOUTH WE WANT TO THEM IN PERSON. THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE OFTEN BECAUSE THEY'RE SO FAR AWAY. SO WE ASK COUNTIES TO DO SKYPE. AND THEY DON'T WANT TO THEY THEY SAY THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY PROBABLY 95% OF COUNTY SAY THEY CAN'T DO IT WE SAY WELL WILL PROVIDE YOU THE LINK. WE HAVE THAT CAPABILITY ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS COLLECT AND TOM OF THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT OUR SKYPE IS HIPPA COMPLIANT -- WEEK. WE CAN DO IT AND IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US WITH A PERSONAL INTERVIEW TO REALLY. OF BEGIN TO CONNECT WITH A YEAR WITH. OUT ONE THING I I I DIDN'T MENTION ABOUT CASA PACIFICA. AND I THINK IS SOMEWHAT RELEVANT IS THAT WE ARE -- AN APA APPROVED INTERNSHIP PROGRAM SO THAT'S THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION. WERE APPROVED BY THEM WE HAVE -- INTERNS WHO COME FROM ALL COUNTRY WE GET ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY APPLICATIONS EVERY YEAR. FOR FIVE TO SEVEN INTERNSHIPS LOTS AND AND THAT'S BEEN -- IT'S A GREAT -- SERVICE I THINK FOR THE FIELD BUT IT'S ALSO A RECRUITMENT TOOL AND WE'RE ABLE. TO HANG ON TO TO SOME OF OUR INTERNS THAT WERE ABLE TO TRAIN THE SO I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT RELATED TO SKYPE BUT IT DID THERE WAS SOME CONNECTION I WAS GONNA MAKE WELL BUT THE CONNECTION I THINK IS THAT THAT HAS SOME OF THE COUNTIES AREN'T WILLING TO DO THIS WHICH IS SOMETHING SIMPLE THAT COULD HELP EXPEDITE THE PROCESS AND I THINK. THAT'S THE CONVERSATION WERE TRYING TO HAVE IS WHAT CHALLENGES YOU HAVE WITH THE I'LL SAVE YOU FOR IT ON BANKING RIGHT THERE THAT I KNEW THERE WAS SOME KIND OF A CONNECTION -- SO LET ME SAY A BIT ABOUT THE YOUTH THAT WE WE DO IT MET THEY THEY ALL MEET MEDICAL NECESSITY OF COURSE THEY ALL REQUIRE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AS HAS BEEN DESCRIBED -- THEY THE ACUITY LEVEL THAT WE SEE IS HIGHER THAN BEFORE WE WERE AN STR TP. WE HAVE -- KIDS WHO ARE. REALLY ACTING OUT THEIR PAIN. WHAT THROUGH -- PHYSICAL DEMONSTRATIONS OF THAT PAIN WHICH INCLUDES PROPERTY DAMAGE -- VIOLENCE TOWARD OTHERS -- KIDS COME TO US YOU'VE HEARD THE DIAGNOSES WE'VE SEEN ALL THOSE DIAGNOSES MAJOR DEPRESSION PTSD. INTERMITTENT EXPLOSIVE DISORDER. WE HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE PORTION A CHAIR OF TRANS GENDERED YOUTH. THERE'S A NEW ARM RELATIVELY NEW -- ACRONYM NOW IN OUR PARLANCE CALLED SO G.. YOU'VE ALL HEARD LGBT Q. SO G. IS SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY EXPRESSION OF SO G. R. E.. AND WE HAVE A GROUP OF A WEEKLY GROUP -- FOR SOCHI KIDS. AND MORE THAN HALF OF THE KIDS IN OUR PROGRAM COME TO THAT GROUP. SO WE OF OF A PLENTY OF YOUTH AND YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE OVER REPRESENTATION OF TRANS GNDER YOUTH IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. ORDER LGBT YOUTH IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM SO. OF THAT CERTAINLY MANIFESTS IN OUR PROGRAM -- WE ALSO SEE MORE SELF INJURIOUS BEHAVIOR THAN WE DID BEFORE WE A REAL SERIOUS CUTTERS. KIDS WHO CUT A IS ANOTHER WAY OF RELIEVING THEIR THEIR PAIN. KIDS WHO WANT TO HANG THEMSELVES WE AT WE ARE OUR CAMPUS. IS -- ON A BUSY ROAD THAT ACTUALLY LEADS. TO OF THE NEWEST A CAL STATE CAL STATE CHANNEL ISLANDS AND IN CAMARILLO. AND KIDS WANNA RUN OUT INTO TRAFFIC AND GET HIT BY A CAR. OF THE TALK ABOUT DOING THAT AND MAKE THOSE ATTEMPTS WE WE DON'T LET THEM IF YOU BELIEVE THEY'RE THEY'RE SERIOUS OBVIOUSLY. LARA MENTION THE CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMS THEIR CRITICALLY IMPORTANT -- TO OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF PERMANENCY AND OF THE THE REFORM OF THE INTENT OF THE REFORM EFFORT OF CCIR WE HAVE SEE OF TEASE ABOUT ONCE A MONTH -- AND OUT A LOT OF THE PLANNING. A AND WHERE A YOUTH GOES NEXT HAPPENS AT THE SEA OF TREES THEIR CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. AND WE SEE REAL -- DIFFERENCES AMONG THE COUNTIES SOME ARE ON IT AND THEY ARE VERY PARTICIPANT THEY OPEN THEIR THERE -- THEY THEY SEE THOSE IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND THEY'RE REAL WORKING VERY HARD. ALL IN THE TRANSITION THAT A YOUTH IS GONNA MAKE AFTER THEY LEAVE OUR CARE -- OTHER COUNTIES NOT SO MUCH AND THEY THEY DON'T PARTICIPATE -- KIDS ARE SUPPOSED TO COME TO US TO IT AS STEERED TO BE WITH CONCRETE. A DISCHARGE AFTER CARE PLANS WHERE THEY GOING NEXT WHAT IS OUR ROLE IN HELPING THEM GET THEIR THEY ALL COME WITH PLANS BUT SOME OF THOSE DISAPPEAR -- FAIRLY SOON AFTER YOUTH IS ADMITTED -- FAMILY VISITS ARE MORE DIFFICULT OBVIOUSLY IF -- WE WANT -- TO STE HAVE KIDS STAY CONNECTED TO FAMILY WE NEED TO HAVE FAMILIES INVOLVED IN TREATMENT. AND IF THEY'RE COMING FROM FAR AWAY. VAN -- WE'RE HAVING. TO CONVINCE COUNTIES THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO BRING FAMILIES YOU CAN YOU PAY FOR THAT COST. I THINK ONE OF THE ON ANTICIPATED -- CONSEQUENCES OF THIS REFORM EFFORT. WAS THAT IS GROUP HOMES KIND OF WENT AWAY AND THE FOCUS BECAME. ARE GOING AWAY AND FOCUSES ON PERMANENCY THAT. OF THERE ARE MORE AND MORE AS STEERED HE'S LIKE CASA PACIFICA WHO ARE SERVING MORE MORE OUT OF COUNTY YOU. ABOUT 80% A 75280% OF THE YOUTH WE SERVE. ARE NO LONGER VENTURA SANTA BARBARA COUNTY THERE FROM COUNTIES AROUND. AROUND THE STATE AND THAT. IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT. THOSE -- AFTER CARE CONNECTIONS FAMILY. INVOLVEMENT WE'VE GOTTA. HAVE WAYS OF HAVING THE FAMILY CONNECTED WHILE THE YOUTH CENTER KERR. THAT'S COSTS THAT EITHER. AND LOOKING AT OUR DATA WE'RE SENDING ABOUT ONE STAFF A WEEK. TO A DAY LONG TRIP TO SOME FAR AWAY COUNTY ACCOMPANYING A YOUTH TO EITHER COURT APPEARANCE OR A FAMILY. OF VISIT AND WE ALSO BRING FAMILIES. TO CASA PACIFICA THAT. TO VENTURA COUNTY THAT IS THAT ABOUT THERE'S A COST THAT WAS NOT ANTICIPATED WE HANDLE THAT COSTS THROUGH A A PRIVATE MONEY PRIMARILY. PART OF CALIFORNIA BUT INDEED. YEAH THAT'S TRUE. SO A WORD ABOUT OUR STAFF FROM WE STRUGGLE WITH -- STAFF OF RECRUITMENT RETENTION -- ALSO ARE FOSTER FAMILY AGENCY FINDING. RESOURCE FAMILIES WE DO HIRE PARENT PARTNERS AND YOUTH ADVOCATES WHO WERE PART OF OUR STAFF WILL WORK WITH THE YOUTH AND FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE -- BUT WE ARE SEEING MORE -- MORE STAFF INJURIES HIGHER TURNOVER THAN WE DID IN PRIOR YEARS SO THAT'S I THINK A CONSEQUENCE OF OF REALLY SERVING THE MOST VULNERABLE -- HIGHEST RISK CHILDREN IN IN OUR IN OUR SYSTEM. COUNTY SUPPORT IS CRITICAL -- AS I MENTIONED CFT PARTICIPATION IS CRITICAL. ONE ISSUE THAT HAS NOT BEEN MENTIONED THAT I WANT TO BRING UP IS THE PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER WHICH ALSO. IMPACTS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SO. ENTER COUNTY LIKE SHASTA COUNTY ABOUT DIANA MIGHT MENTION THIS -- IS IS WHAT WE WOULD CALL A HIGHLY IMPACT COUNTY. SO -- AS A HIGHLY IMPACTED COUNTY WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THAT. THERE ARE MORE KIDS BEING IMPORTED TO USE THEIR VERY CRASS PHRASE INTO VENTURA COUNTY. THAT NOW VENTURA COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH IS RESPONSIBLE. FOR SAME IN CHESTER COUNTY ALSO SO. YOU HAVE COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA TO EXPORT KIDS DON'T HAVE LOCAL RESOURCES. OTHER COUNTIES WHERE RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR WHERE COUNTIES ARE DOING A BETTER JOB. WELL -- MAY BE HELD MAYBE THAT THEY THAT I'M BUT I CAN TELL YOU VENTURA COUNTY IS NOT HAPPY HAVING A CASA PACIFICA A MAGNET SORT OF PROGRAM. OF FOR THE STATE WHEN THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR THAT. CHILD WHO WAS PLACED. OUR OUR OUR WHAT WE'RE ASKING OUR COUNTY TO SUPPORT IN TERMS OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED. TO ALL OF THESE OUT OF COUNTY YOUTH THE IS -- A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OUR CONTRACT. AND THEY ARE BEARING THE BRUNT OF THAT. BECAUSE OF PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER. THE INTENT OF PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER WAS THAT IF. SAY UP. YOU THIRD A CHILD GETS PLACED WITH GRANDMA FROM RIVERSIDE AND THEY COME TO VENTURA COUNTY. WE DON'T WANT GRANDMA TO HAVE TO GO TO RIVERSIDE TO GET MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR THAT YOU. SOLD VENTURA YEAR NOW RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING ALL SERVICES. THAT WAS FINE. EXCEPT FOR STR KEEP PEAS WHICH ARE THE HIGH COST -- BUT A SERVICES THAT ARE BEING DELIVERED TO EVER YOUTH WHOSE. WHOSE PLACED SO THAT PUTS A HUGE. ON THOSE IMPORTED COUNTY SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT AND GOING BACK TO THE THE FUNDING MECHANISMS AGAIN DOES THAT MEAN THAT -- THEY'RE NOT BEING REIMBURSED AT ALL OR THEY'RE BEING REIMBURSED TWO YEARS LATER WELL. AND NOW THEY'RE NOT BEING REIMBURSED AT ALL THIS IS THIS HAS TO BE VENTURA COUNTY REALIGNMENT FUNDS THAT ARE USED AS THE MATCH. AND THERE HASN'T DR YES. AND THEY WOULD BE EVENTUALLY REIMBURSE THE 50% FFP. EVENTUALLY. BUT YOU KNOW YEAR REALIGNMENT ALLOCATION IS BUILT PRIOR -- TO THE YEAR STARTING. AND SO THERE ARE COUNTIES -- ACCOUNTING I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH A FEW WEEKS AGO WHO -- HAS ABOUT FOUR CHILDREN. OUT OF COUNTY AND THEY HAVE A HUNDRED BED IN THEIR COUNTY. SO IT'S NOT QUITE FULL BUT THEY POTENTIALLY WENT FROM FOUR KIDS THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE. FOR TO POTENTIALLY. EIGHTY KIDS SUDDENLY THAT THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIGH END. VERY INTENSIVE DAILY SERVICES SO IT'S A IT'S A BIG DEAL. THANK YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT YEAH CAN YOU SPEAK IF YOU CAN TO THE AB TWELVE NINETY NINE WHICH WAS CHAPTER IN -- TWENTY SIXTEEN I BELIEVE THERE WAS AN ALL COUNTY LETTER THAT WENT OUT IN JULY HAS THAT IMPROVE FOR WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF THAT ALL COUNTY -- THE LETTER REALLY WAS DESIGNED TO JUST INSTRUCT ON THE PROCESS IT DIDN'T. CHANGE THE PROCESS OR CHANGE IT DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING OF THE STRUCTURE IT JUST IN -- CLARIFIED FOR FOLKS TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND AND AT THIS POINT THERE'S PROBABLY STILL SOME CONFUSION BUT THE BIGGER PIECES THE COST. THERE IS A PROCESS THAT THE COUNTIES HAVE DEVELOPED WITH -- CAL MESA -- AND SOME COUNTIES ARE OPTING INTO THAT PROCESS AND SUMMER NOT. AND I BECAUSE I AGAIN DON'T DEAL SPECIFIC I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THE FISCAL PEACE BUT I DON'T DEAL WITH IT. DAY IN AND DAY OUT I DON'T KNOW -- HOW THE FLOW IS GOING THAT SOMETHING I CAN FIND OUT BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW THE FLOW IS GOING? AGAIN IT'S DESIGNED NOT ALL COUNTIES HAVE SO THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES FOR THAT AND CERTAINLY. AN EXPORTER COUNTY. THAT HAS NO BEDS IN THERE COUNTY. SHOULD THEY OFTEN DO THEY OPT IN YOU KNOW THERE'S ALL THOSE KINDS OF CHALLENGES AND SO. I WILL BE ASKING A DIFFERENT WITH OKAY. NONE OF THEM SEND THE MONEY BACK TO THE STATE DO THEY THEY ALL EXCEPT. THE FUNDS REALIGN IT COMES WITH THE REGIONALES COUNTY THAT THEN DECIDE NOT TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND EXPORT THOSE TO OTHERS. IT IT IT'S YES AND IT IS NOT THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. CALL AS TO WHETHER A CHILD IS PRESUMPTIVELY TRANSFERRED OR NOT IT IS THE PLACING AGENCIES FINAL DECISION. MENTAL HEALTH PLAN IS INFORMED ABOUT THE DECISION MADE HER PARTICIPATE DURING THE CHILD AND FAMILY TEAM. BUT THEY CANNOT FORMALLY REQUEST THAT PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER BE WAIVED -- THAT IS THERE'S A VERY SMALL GROUP OF FOLKS THAT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO SO SO THERE'S SOME CHALLENGES. FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE FOR THE MIDDLE HEALTH PLANS WITH THAT I'M PROBABLY DELVING TOO FAR IN FOR THIS COMMITTEE BUT WILL WANT TO FOLLOW UP ONLY BECAUSE I I WAS FROM PRESIDENT. AND KINGS DIDN'T HAVE ANY BEDS. AND AND SO YES THEY'RE RECEIVING FUNDS BUT ARE THEY PROVIDING CARE TO THE FOSTER CHILDREN IN THEIR COUNTY. IS IT THEN FAIR TO THE REST OF THE COUNTIES THAT SURROUND -- TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE. AND DO WHAT'S NECESSARY LIKE CASA PACIFICA IS RIGHT AND AND THERE ARE MANY COUNTIES THAT ARE AND THERE'S JUST. CHALLENGES WITH THE PROCESS AND UNDERSTANDING. AND THE PACE AND ALSO CHALLENGES AS AS THEIR LEARNING PARTICULARLY THE NEWER PROVIDERS SOME OF THE SMALLER PROVIDERS AS THEIR LEARNING. THE SYSTEM AND THEY'RE LEARNING TO BECOME TO SERVE THIS HIGHER AND POPULATION THAT'S THERE'S A GROWTH THERE'S A LEARNING CURVE. WELL ONE OF THE IF IF I CAN TO AND I JUST WANT TO GET IT RIGHT IT IS CUT THAT ENOUGH RIGHT AND JUST WE'VE HEARD MULTIPLE PRONOUNCE. THREE OKAY -- AS AS COMPANY NOW WAS TALKING ABOUT I I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT HOW WE MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE PERMANENCY. YES. AND AND ARE WE TALKING ABOUT MOVING KIDS OUT OF THE COUNTY THE ONLY COUNTY THEY MAY KNOW. IT'S AN HOUR TALKING ABOUT TRANSFERRING THEM ALL THE WAY ACROSS STATE IN A PENDING MANY FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS THEY HAVE THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES ABSALOM THE ACTIONS WE HOMES ON JUST. FOR US TO HAVE REAL PERMANENCY WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE BEST TREATMENT WE CAN THE CLOSEST TO HOME THAT WE CAN. SO CAN I I JUST WANT TO SAY ONE THING BECAUSE WE'VE TALKED WE TALKED SOME ABOUT THE MONEY AND OF COURSE WE NEED THE MONEY IN ORDER TO MAKE THE SERVICES HAPPENED. I HAD TO GO TO THE BOARD AND ASK FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWO AND TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF KIDS FROM OUTSIDERS SHASTA COUNTY -- COMING IN -- THERE'S ALSO THE PIECE YOU JUST TOUCHED ON IT. THAT. ALL OF A SUDDEN FOSTER YOUTH THAT HAVE LEARNT LIVED IN ONE COUNTY THEIR LIFETIME ARE TRANSFERRED TO SHASTA COUNTY. JUST COUNTY DOESN'T OTHER MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS WE DON'T KNOW THE HISTORY OF WHAT'S GONE ON BUT YET WERE RESPONSIBLE. FOR THE HIGHEST NEEDS TO USE -- WITH IN ANOTHER COUNTY TO PROVIDE THEM SERVICES AND DO WE REALLY DO THE BEST JOB IF WE DO NOT KNOW THE HISTORY AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH THEM. ONLY TO HAVE THEM LEAVE SIX MONTHS NINE MONTHS EVEN TWELVE MONTHS LATER TO RETURN BACK TO THEIR COUNTY. IT WOULD SEEM LIKE RATHER THAN -- SO I I DO NOT DO THAT JUST COUNTY -- I WAY PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER ON ALL MY YOUTH THAT ARE PLACED IN S. T. R. T. PIECE SIMPLY BECAUSE I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE CHILDREN AND I WANT TO CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THEM AND ENSURE THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO THEM. AND MY EXPECTATION WOULD BE THE ALL SO THE PIECE OF STE FOR THE RIGHT AND LISTENING TO THIS -- AND I KEEP STATING YOU KNOW THAT I WAS A TEACHER BY I SEE SO MANY SIMILARITIES BETWEEN. TEACHING BECAUSE IT THEIR ALL OUR KIDS SO AND I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT AND AN EARLY TWENTY NINETEEN ABOUT THE TRANSFER SITUATION BUT BUT FOR STUDENTS WE HAVE. THE MONEY FOLLOWS THE KID SOUL SOUL YOU KNOW EACH STUDENT IS ASSIGNED X. AMOUNT OF DOLLARS AND NO MATTER WHAT SCHOOL DISTRICT THEY GO TO THAT TIED YOU RECEIVE THAT MONEY FOR THAT CHILD. NOW IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE. YOU IN THIS IS ALL. YOU KNOW I'M JUST SPEAKING OUT LOUD AT THIS POINT BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE MIGHT I MEAN IF WE CAN DO IT FOR THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. I WOULD HOPE. THAT WE COULD DO IT FOR SOME OF THESE ESPECIALLY FOR THESE CRITICAL SERVICES SERVER MARKET JUMP AND TOOK TO MAKE THIS A LITTLE MORE PRACTICAL TO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE HIGH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES COST PER CHILD IN AN S. T. R. TP. IT'S GONNA RANGE AROUND THE STATE FROM BETWEEN FOUR THOUSAND A MONTH TWO SEVEN SEVEN EIGHT FIVE HUNDRED A MONTH. THAT'S GOING TO BE THE AVERAGE COST SO IF THE YOUTH IS IN PLACEMENT. IN A FACILITY FOR SIX MONTHS. YOU'RE TALKING AS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY IN VENTURA COUNTY WE WENT TO THE COUNTY -- EARLY ON AND SAID WE'RE GONNA NEED A MILLION MORE IN OUR CONTRACT. TO SERVE THESE OUT ACCOUNT KIDS AND DATE JUST ABOUT -- FAINTED. AT THAT REQUEST -- WE WE WOUND UP DOING LESS THAN THAN THAT BUT BUT AN AMOUNT THAT WE THINK WE CAN MANAGE WITH WHAT WHAT HAPPENS OVER TIME I THINK THE THINKING HAS BEEN. THAT WHAT HAPPENS OVER TIME IS THAT BEEN TURKEY CLAIMS. BASED -- FOR THOSE KIDS WHO WERE NOW THEY ARE NOW RESPONSIBLE. FOR SO AT OVER TIME THEY'RE GOING TO WIND UP GETTING THAT MONEY NEXT YEAR'S ALLOCATION IS GOING TO BE BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF CLAIMS THEY HAVE OF THEIR CLAIMS ARE GOING UP. SO THE THEORY IS THAT OVER THAT IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS LET'S SAY. EVERYTHING'S GONNA EVEN OUT BECAUSE THE MONEY DOES FOLLOW THE RIGHT. BITE BUT BETTER THREE YEARS THEY HAD ISSUE. THAT COUNTIES ARE FACING IN THE MEAN TIME. THERE WAS A EFFORT A SOLUTION THAT THAT ARE OF ASSOCIATION PROPOSAL LAST YEAR SEVENTY FIVE MILLION. DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND MONEY WHICH IT LOOKS LIKE WAS GONNA GO PLACES BUT IT DIDN'T. FOR SOME REASON HERE -- I FOUND TO BE A REAL HEALTH FOLKS THOUGHT THAT THIS CAL MESA IDEA THAT THEY HAD WAS KIND ARE GONNA DO IT BUT IN ANY EVENT IT IS A IT IS AN ISSUE. FOR I WOULD GUESS AT LEAST A DOZEN COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA WHO WERE IMPORTING KIDS AND YOU HAVE THIS BIG CASH ISSUE RIGHT BUT BUT AGAIN USING THE SCHOOL ANALOGY -- WHEN THAT KID WHEN A STUDENT TRANSFERS TO ANOTHER DISTRICT THAT MONEY IS IMMEDIATE? UP ON THE EIGHTY EIGHT AS WELL AS THE CUMULATIVE RECORDS ONCE THE STUDENT TRANSFERS OVER WE ARE REQUIRED I'VE YOU KNOW MANY TIMES SIXTEEN YEARS TEACHING I HAD TO FILL OUT THE EXIT -- CUME WITH THE REPORT CARDS AND YOU KNOW PROOF OF THE WORK SAMPLES AND ALL OF THAT AND KIND OF IN A REAL SMALL PARAGRAPH HAS TO WHAT. ISSUES IF THERE WERE ANY WITH THAT STUDENT IN VACUUM GOES TO THAT FOLLOWING SCHOOL IN NOW GRANTED IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT A MONTH. BUT IT WOULD MAKE IT THERE AND THEN THE FUNDING WAS DIRECTLY. I YOU KNOW FOLLOWING THE CHILD NOT THREE YEARS LATER AND I THINK TO BE DISCUSSED LATER BUT THAT'S IF WE CAN DO IT IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND CLEARLY THE NEED IS SO HIGH. IT'S NOT RIGHT FOR THOSE COUNTIES THAT ARE DOING A GOOD JOB TO GET THE INFLUX OF KIDS BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING A GOOD JOB. AND THEN NOT BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN IT WHICH ESSENTIALLY IS GOING TO ERODE YOUR PROGRAM BECAUSE NOW YOU DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING FOR IT AND SO THE HIGH QUALITY SERVICES YOU'RE PROVIDING YOU ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO PROVIDE BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. BUT AGAIN THESE ARE ALL ME SPEAKING OUT LOUD IN TRYING TO KIND OF MAKE SURE THAT NEXT TIME WE CAN REMEMBER YOU KNOW PARTS OF THE CONVERSATION ARE ALL OF THE CONVERSATION SO THAT WE CAN REALLY MAKE SOME CHANGES. ONE OF THE PRACTICAL ISSUES I THINK IS GOING TO ULTIMATELY BE THAT. THAT BOB PROVIDERS WHO HAVE BEDS ARE GONNA SELL THEM TO COMMERCIAL INSURANCE COMPANIES TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND NOT DEAL WITH HER OR OR REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF BEDS THERE MAKING AVAILABLE TO THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM SIMPLY BECAUSE OF OF ISSUES LIKE AT THE IS PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER. SO. ALL RIGHT THANK YOUR THERE'S CLEARLY OF A LOT OF ISSUES BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE CONVERSATIONS AND YOU KNOW IF WE DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR OUR FOR THIS PANEL. RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT BECAUSE WE HAVE A TON OF QUESTIONS FOR LATER BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS DIALOGUE BECAUSE I THINK YOU KNOW IF ANYTHING -- FOR US UP HERE -- WE CAN TAKE SOME OF THESE -- IDEAS IN THOSE PERFECT THE SOMEONE -- THE AS SELECT COMMITTEE ON FOSTER USE THAT HERE AND HUMAN SERVICES IS HERE SO THAT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S A TEAM EFFORT WE CAN'T SOLVE IT. CLEARLY NOT ON OUR OWN SO WE NEED ALL OF YOU. TO TO INTERJECT AND HELP US WITH ALL OF THE INS AND OUTS OF THIS SO THANK YOU AGAIN I APPRECIATED AND AT I KNOW WE HAVE ANOTHER PANEL COMING AND THEY HAVE TO LEAVE ARE THERE. SOMEBODY HAS TO GO ON A PLANE SO THANK YOU AGAIN [inaudible] LARA. THANK YOU SO OUR NEXT PANEL IS. KATHY DOES CENTER LINK DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CAN YOU OFFER DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION QUORUM LATELY -- MPP JD MENTAL HEALTH ATTORNEY LIAISON CHILDREN'S LAWCENTER OF LOS ANGELES AND SHE IS THE ONE THAT HAS TO GO ON A PLANE SO WE WILL. I GIVE HER THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO FIRST AND THEN CAN BURKE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF ZENECA FAMILY. OF AGENCIES THANK YOU. WELCOME AND THANK YOU FOR BEING SO PATIENT MY APOLOGIES. SO I'M GOOD AFTERNOON I WANT TO START BY THANKING -- THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND CHAIRS AND CO CHAIRS. THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON FOSTER CARE IN THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY COMMITTEES ON HUMAN SERVICES FOR COMING TOGETHER TO FOCUS ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE -- MY NAME IS MORE MALANI AND I AM AN ATTORNEY WITH THE CHILDREN'S LAWCENTER OF CALIFORNIA. FOR THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS -- FIVE FORTY FIVE IS A CASE KERN ATTORNEY IN THE COURT ROOM EVERYDAY REPRESENTING. FOSTER USE AND THE LAST TEN PLUS AS A MEMBER OF THE MENTAL HEALTH ADVOCACY TEAM -- MY COLLEAGUES ALSO PRESENT TODAY WITH ME -- OUR CLINICIAN MEMBER OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH ADVOCACY TEAM. SO STILL SEE THE CHILDREN'S LAWCENTER REPRESENTS CHILDREN IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM IN LOS ANGELES PLACER IN SACRAMENTO COUNTIES. APPROXIMATELY THIRTY THREE THOUSAND CHILDREN WHICH ARE HALF THE STATE'S FOSTER CARE POPULATION. GOOD MENTAL HEALTH AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY FOR A FOSTER YOUTH INCLUDES. I HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS COMMUNITY IDENTITY [inaudible] CULTURAL CONNECTION. AND MEANINGFUL WORK OR EDUCATION. SOMETIMES IT REQUIRES PROFESSIONAL INTERVENTION THERAPY AND OR MEDICATION. EACH CHILD ADOLESCENT AND YOUNG ADULT NEED SOMETHING TO DO. SOMEWHERE TO BELONG. AND SOMETHING TO HOPE. FOR FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS OUR MENTAL HEALTH ADVOCACY TEAM IT'S STILL SEE HAS WORKED COLLABORATIVELY TO ENSURE A STRONG CLINICAL CASE COORDINATION. AMONG OUR ATTORNEYS LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN FAMILY SERVICES. LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH AND NUMEROUS COMMUNITY PROVIDERS. OUR GOAL IS TO SUPPORT THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR FOSTER YOUTH AND NON MINOR DEPENDENCE. AS A RESULT OF ARE DECADE LONG EFFORT AT AT IN M. HAD TO BUILD BRIDGES AMONG OUR ORGANIZATIONS WE ARE ABLE TO REQUEST AND RECEIVE -- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR OUR CLIENTS MUCH MORE EASILY. NOW WITH THE PASSAGE OF CC ARE WE ARE CLOSER THAN EVER TO REALIZING OUR COLLECTIVE GOAL TO ENSURE THAT EVERY FOSTER CHILD AND YOUNG ADULT. IS HEALTHY BENTLEY AND PHYSICALLY. SO FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT AT CLC -- SOME OF THE IMPORTANT POSITIVE PIECES OUR THE SHIFT IN OUR COLLECTIVE THINKING ABOUT -- MENTAL HEALTH A NEW AND GREAT ON I UNDERSTAND THAT MENTAL HEALTH AFFECTS US ALL AND SHOULD BE VIEWED IN A MORE HOLISTIC WAY. A NEW FOCUS ON FINDING A PERMANENT HOME FOR EVERY FOSTER YOUTH. SO INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR A CHILD TO STABILIZE BEFORE FINDING A HOME WHICH HAS BEEN THE PRACTICE PREVIOUSLY. NOW WE LOOK FOR A HOME WHERE THE CHILD CAN OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN STABILITY. THEY'RE NOT WAITING TO BE GOOD ENOUGH -- ARE STABLE ENOUGH TO GET A HOME THEY DESERVE A HOME FROM THE BEGINNING. THE REALIZATION THAT DISCHARGE PLANNING IT'S CRITICAL THAT WAS SPOKEN -- BY THE GENTLEMAN FROM CASA PACIFICA. EVERY FOSTER YOUTH WHO ENTERS CONGRESS CARE MUST HAVE A DISCHARGE PLAN FROM THE DATE OF ADMISSION. DISCHARGE PLANNING SHOULD BEGIN WHEN THE CHILD ENTERS CONGREGATE CARE NOT WHEN THEY'RE READY TO TRANSITION. UNLESS FOCUS ON DIAGNOSIS. DIAGNOSIS AND BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS AND MORE FOCUS ON STRENGTH. AND FUTURE POSSIBILITY OF EVERY CHILD. ALLOWING THE CHILD TO DRIVE THE CFT PROCESS RATHER THAN THE AGENCY PROFESSIONALS COURSE. OF THE CHILD THE CHILD AND YOUTH NEED ON THE SUPPORT OF ADULTS IN THEIR LIVES AND SOMETIMES AGENCY PROFESSIONALS BUT THE SEA OF TO PROCESS SHOULD BE. DRIVEN BY THE CHILD. SOME OF THE ONGOING CHALLENGES THAT WE SEE IN COURT EVERYDAY -- OF C. C. R. INCLUDE THE RFA PROCESS WHICH HAS MADE IT MORE CUMBERSOME FOR RELATIVES TO BECOME APPROVED CARE GIVERS. THE DELAY -- IN APPROVAL THESE CHILDREN IN FOSTER HOMES ARE CONGREGATE CARE FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME. AND LEAVES CARE GIVERS WITHOUT NEEDED SOME IN THEIR CARE. DISCHARGE FROM S. YOUR CHEAPEST FACILITIES WHICH WERE STARTING TO SEE NOW BECAUSE THE SIX MONTH TIME FRAME HAS STARTED TO RUN ON A LOT OF OUR CLIENTS HAVE BEEN PLACED IN THE S. R. T. P. FACILITIES. SO ALTHOUGH THE STAYS ARE MEANT TO BE LIMITED IN TIME THERE ARE FEW SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT YOU THEIR TRANSITION WHEN APPROPRIATE. SO AS COUNSEL FOR THE CHILD WE NEED LEVERAGE -- TO LIMIT OUR CLIENT STAND CONGREGATE CARE. A LACK OF TRAINING FOR LINE SOCIAL WORKERS ATTORNEYS PROVIDERS AND CARE GIVERS ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CCIR. IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT THERE IS A GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO SCREEN AND CERTIFY FOR S. T. R. T. P. PLACEMENT THERE'S LOTS OF QUESTIONS FROM THE SOCIAL WORKERS ON A DAILY BASIS. ABOUT HOW TO GET -- S. T. R. T. P. SCREENING AND CERTIFICATION MUCH LESS PLACEMENT THOSE ARE ALL SEPARATE PROCESSES AND THEY HAVE THEIR OWN. SEPARATE CHALLENGES. LOTS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR AFFAIR APPROVAL STILL AND THE PURPOSE AND PROCESS OF CF TEAM MEETINGS. ARE AS THE CHILD ADVOCATE THE ATTORNEY FOR THE CHILD. OFTENTIMES OUR CLIENTS WANT OUR PRESENCE AT THE SEA OF TEAM MEETINGS AND IF WE ATTENDED COUNTY COUNCIL THEN. IT WILL SAY THAT THEY NEED TO ATTEND SO THAT IT BECOMES THIS KIND OF BATTLE AS TO HOW TO SCHEDULE THESE MEETINGS WITH ALL THESE. YOU KNOW ATTORNEYS PRESENT WHICH IS TOTALLY NOT THE FOCUS OF WHAT THE MEETING SHOULD BE ABOUT. SO -- THAT CAN BECOME WE CAN KIND OF GET BOGGED DOWN IN SOME OF THOSE. MY NEWS AND SOME OF THAT MY NISHA. IN THE N. C. C. R. WILL ONLY BE AS EFFECTIVE AS ITS IMPLEMENTATION TO ENSURE THEIR CLIENTS HAVE COMPREHENSIVE AND CHILD FOCUSED CASE PLANTS. SO THIS IS MY OPPORTUNITY TO ALSO LET YOU KNOW THAT OVER THE PAST DECADE WORKING EVERY DAY WITH ATTORNEYS AND AND CHILDREN. ADOLESCENTS AND NON MEYER DEPENDENT IN THE COURTROOM -- OUR MENTAL HEALTH TEAM HAS ENCOUNTERED ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES TO PROVIDING EFFECTIVE AND APPROPRIATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THESE INCLUDE THE NEED FOR CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE AND LANGUAGE SPECIFIC THERAPIST TO WORK WITH CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. THERE'S OFTENTIMES WHERE CHILDREN FAMILIES ARE WAITING -- TO BE RECONCILED. THROUGH THE REUNIFICATION PROCESS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT RECEIVING APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE. BASED TREATMENT. QUALITY HOMES FOR YOUTH AND NOMAR DEPENDENCE WITH FOSTER PARENTS WHO ARE TRAINED SUPPORTED AND WILLING TO REMAIN COMMITTED. I'VE HAD QUITE A BIT OF EXPERIENCE OF THE LAST DECADE WORKING WITH IT OF STEEP FOSTER PARENTS AND DESPITE. THE TRAINING THAT FOSTER PARENTS FOR STILL A REAL CHALLENGE AND I'VE HEARD THAT TODAY IS TO MAINTAIN PLACEMENT SO THAT'S A CONSTANT STRUGGLE. OUR EMERGENCY SHELTER FACILITIES FOR NON MINOR DEPENDENT MALES. THERE ARE NONE -- IN LA COUNTY SO THE A A YOUNG MALES BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY ONE AND UP IN ADULT HOMELESS SHELTERS IN DOWNTOWN LA -- BECAUSE THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE FOR THEM TO GO. THERE'S A LACK OF BOARD CERTIFIED CHILD PSYCHIATRIST SO WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN DEBATE. WHETHER MEDICATION IS A GOOD THING OR NOT A GOOD THING BUT IF A CHILD IS PRESCRIBED MEDICATION THEY NEED TO BE SEEN BY A DOCTOR -- HAND SO. IT'S VERY HARD A LOT OF OUR CLIENTS WAIT FORTY FIVE DAYS TO GET AN APPOINTMENT AND SO THAT THIRTY DAY YOU KNOW EXITING EITHER FROM THE HOSPITAL WITH THE NEED -- FOR A REFILL THE PRESCRIPTION OR ANOTHER MEDICATION EVALUATION -- THERE ARE RESORTING TO LOCAL EMERGENCY ROOMS OR URGENT CARE FACILITIES TO GET THAT MEDICAL TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED AND I KNOW YOU'RE ALL EDUCATED THAT. THERE'S LAB TESTS AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER MEDICARE MEDICAL AND HEALTH A SAFEGUARDS FOR CHILDREN ON MEDICATION. ONE OTHER REALLY BIG ISSUE. FOR US WITH OUR CLIENTS AS WE NEED THE REGIONAL CENTER WE NEED GREATER COLLABORATION FROM THE REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES. TO PROVIDE SERVICES TARGETED TO ME OUR CLIENTS NEEDS -- AT HOT WEATHER THERE AT HOME OR IN CARE. SO THAT IS ALSO A STRUGGLE -- CLIENTS THAT HAVE BOTH A DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY AND A MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS. ARE MUCH GREATER RISK TO SPEND MUCH MORE TIME OUT OF THE HOME AND IN CONGREGATE CARE. SO -- WE HAVE ALL SORTS OF LEGAL STRATEGIES AT OUR DISPOSAL WE CAN SUBPOENA THE REGIONAL CENTER AND JOIN THE REGIONAL CENTER BUT IT IS A CHALLENGE TO GET. THE REGIONAL CENTER TO PARTICIPATE FROM THE BEGINNING -- IT'S INSTEAD OF IT BEING A FIGHT TO KIND OF GET INVOLVEMENT -- AND FIND APPROPRIATE PLACEMENT. SO OUR CLIENTS THAT HAVE MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES THAT ARE DEVELOPMENTALLY DELAYED NEED A DIFFERENT KIND OF TREATMENT IT NEEDS TO BE TARGETED TO THEIR OWN. DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS AND SO SOMETIMES IT TAKES A SPECIAL KIND OF KIND OF INTERVENTION -- ONE FINAL IMPORTANT ADVOCACY CONCERN IS I HEARD DISCUSSION EARLIER ABOUT THE MATTER ASSESSMENT WHEN. LA COUNTY DCFS. WAS SPEAKING -- WE DON'T GET THE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CLIENTS HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS AT THE TIME THAT THE COURT MAKES THE DISPOSITION PLAN. SO EVERY CHILD THAT COMES AND FAMILY THAT COMES THROUGH THE COURT SYSTEM -- AT DETENTION THE JUDGE ORDERS -- A HUB WHICH IS THE MEDICAL. EXAM AND A MAP ASSESSMENT. THE PROBLEM IS THERE'S A DISPOSITION CASE PLAN THAT'S MADE FOR THE FAMILY THAT ORDERS PARENTS INTO CERTAIN -- CLASSES IN PARENTING AS WELL AS FOR THE CHILD AND WE DON'T HAVE THE HEALTH. DEVELOPMENTAL OR MENTAL HEALTH INFORMATION WE NEED BEFORE MAKE THAT DISPOSITION CASE PLAN AND SOMETIMES WE DON'T EVER GET THE MATTER. SO THAT MEANS THAT THE THE THE NEEDS OF THE CHILD OR THE ADOLESCENT OR THE NON MY DEPEND ARE COMING UP KIND OF WHEN THEY COME UP IN THE COURT REPORTS ARE BECAUSE OF BEHAVIORAL ISSUES AND NOT. ON THE FRONT END AND IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR MANY YEARS AND DON'T SEEM TO HAVE BE ABLE. TO MOVE THAT FORWARD IT'S PART OF THE READ PART OF IT IS BECAUSE OF THE DELAY -- I MEAN ABOUT ASSESSMENT TIME FRAME DOESN'T MATCH UP WITH THE JUDICIAL TIME FRAME AND SO THERE IS A LACK OF INFORMATION -- SO THESE ARE JUST SOME OF AND I AM JUST VERY GRATEFUL TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH TO PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT. BECAUSE OFTENTIMES MENTAL HEALTH IS NOT -- ARE REALLY POPULAR CONVERSATION SO THIS IS A REAL. THIS IS GREAT FOR ME OF BEING ON THE FRONT LINES EVERYDAY WORKING WITH KIDS AND FAMILIES. A DAY IN AND DAY OUT IT'S JUST GREAT TO BE ABLE TO COME IN AND SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF MY UP KIND OF MY WISH LIST AND HOPES FOR THE FUTURE SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS. DR RANDALL YEAH -- FIRST I LOVE THE MENTAL HEALTH AFFECTS US ALL IT REALLY DOES AND ALL OF US HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB OF TALKING ABOUT IT MORE -- I WANTED TO SPECIFICALLY ASK YOU ABOUT THE ARE SAYS -- IS THAT GETTING ANY BETTER THEIR IT'S SLOW AND SO. I THINK THAT PEOPLE WANT CARE GIVERS TO BE APPROVED THE PROBLEM IS AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ALREADY TODAY IF THERE'S A THERE'S A IT SEEMS LIKE THE BEST A RELATIVES AND GRANDPARENTS AND THE BEST PEOPLE THE MOST COMMITTED PEOPLE. IT SEEMS LIKE THEY TAKE THE LONGEST TO GET ACTUALLY THE MONEY THEY NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THE CHILD. AND BECAUSE THEY'RE SO GREAT AND EVERYONE'S SO POSITIVE AND YOU KNOW ABOUT THEM WE DON'T BUT WE DON'T SUPPORT THEM THEY STILL NEED THE FUNDING AND THEY NEED THE RESOURCES AND SO WE GET HUNG UP. THE IT SEEMS LIKE SOMETIMES THE COUNTY AGENCIES CAN GET HUNG UP ON DOTTING THE I'S AND CROSSING THE T.'S SEE IN THE OLD DAYS WE ONLY NEEDED A A CLEAN KHAKI IN A CLASS. TO PLACE WITH A RELATIVE SO WE WENT THROUGH THOSE DAYS WHERE IT WAS MUCH EASIER FROM THE FROM DETENTION TO GET A CHILD WITH FAMILY SO GETTING A CHILD WITH FAMILY SO NOW WE HAVE LIKE A HOLDOVER WHERE DO WE PUT THEM. BEFORE THEY GO WITH FAMILY AND THEY WERE SHOULD BE WITH FAMILY FROM THE BEGINNING I MEAN THE LESS DISRUPTION. THE BETTER CELL WILL AND WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW UP IF I CAN BUT IF THERE ARE DELAYS THAT ARE STILL HAPPENING UP TO SIX MONTHS WHICH IS WHAT WE HEARD DURING SOMEONE THIS LAST YEAR WHICH IS UNACCEPTABLE THE TOPICS FOR FAMILIES TO BE BEARING THE COST FOR THAT LONG. WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT IT AND HELP OUT AND SO THAT'S WHY I STARTED BY ASKING THAT QUESTION. I DID WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SOMETHING SOMETIMES THERE ARE GOOD NEWS THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT -- WE INCLUDED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN HERE TO HELP US ADDRESS THE NEEDS WITHIN PSYCHIATRY CHI AND SPECIFICALLY WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT CHILD PSYCHIATRISTS AT THE UC SYSTEM -- BECAUSE OF BECAUSE THE NEED IS SO GREAT -- AND THERE IS NEEDS AND I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHT IT BECAUSE YOU SAID IT I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE SAID EVERY TIME WE CAN. CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE AND LANGUAGE APPROPRIATE ARE SO IMPORTANT FOR COMMUNITIES LIKE. TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE COMMUNICATING WITH PEOPLE AND ALLOWING THEM TO HEAR IT AND PROCESS IT OFTENTIMES HAVE TO SPEAK. IN A WAY THAT THE WHOLE UNDERSTAND YOU. AND SO -- MAKING SURE THAT OUR PROVIDERS AND CLINICIANS ARE ABLE TO DO THAT IS QUITE IMPORTANT SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTING. ANY THE COMMON TO QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND BEING PATIENT. NOT THAT'S OKAY AND NOW I'M GOING TO STAY AS LONG AS I CAN OKAY PERFECT THANK YOU THANK YOU. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS KATHY SETTLING WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE ON THIS PANEL AND I THINK. A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT ALL MENTIONED HAVE YOU'VE HEARD AS THEMES I THINK TODAY SO IT'S BEEN HELPFUL TO BE LISTENING TO THE OTHER -- PARTICIPANTS IN THE OTHER PANELS AND EVEN MY COLLEAGUE HERE AND HERE VERY SIMILAR THINGS HOPEFULLY KIND OF WRAPPING THEM TOGETHER AND GIVING SOME POTS ABOUT WHERE WE ARE AND PERHAPS WHERE WE ARE HEADED OR COULD HEAD. WITH THE RIGHT SUPPORT. I AGREE THERE'S JUST BEEN SUCH A SIGNIFICANT OF ENSURING THAT OUR FOSTER YOUTH -- AT BEING BOTH IDENTIFIED AND SERVED WITH APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES FROM AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE AND OUR INTERACTION WITH THEM. YA I'VE BEEN AT THE SHOP FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS AND I DON'T THINK WE TALKED ABOUT THAT VERY MUCH FOR THE FIRST SEVERAL AND NOW WE'VE BEEN. I THINK SEEING -- THROUGH KATIE A THROUGH THE PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS ISSUE THAT NOW WE ARE TRACKING DATA ON THAT AND HAVE MUCH HEIGHTENED REQUIREMENTS AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY. TO GET THOSE MEDICATIONS AUTHORIZED MONITORED AND THEN RE UPPED IF THERE ARE THE YOUTH ARE ON THEM -- FOR ANY PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN I THINK NOW MOVING TO SUCH A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF TRAUMA AND ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND HOW THAT AFFECTS THE YOUTH THAT WE SERVE. EVEN JUST BEING REMOVED FROM THE HOME AS A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE THAT CAN LEAD TO THE NEED FOR SOME SERVICES RELATED TO THAT -- SO I COULD HAVE THREE MAIN POINTS IN THAT HAPPY TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE COME UP THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE OUTSIDE OF THAT -- I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE IDENTIFICATION OF NEEDS FOR THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH WE SERVE. THE COORDINATION OF SERVICES FOR THEM AND THEN -- FRANKLY THE NEED FOR MORE PRACTITIONERS AND PROVIDERS TO SERVE THEM IN I'M A COUPLE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN WAYS -- RELATED TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE IT USED TO BE MORE DELAYED AND NOW WE'RE TRYING TO DO IT EARLIER OF THAT'S TO ACROSS THE SYSTEM CERTAINLY AND ARE. ON CHILD WELFARE AREA THE ASSESSMENT STARTED -- HAPPENING MUCH FASTER MUCH UP FRONT YOU FOR THE EXAMPLES FROM LOS ANGELES AND SHASTA TODAY. AND WE ARE NOW MAKING A TRANSITION TO THIS TOOL THAT YOU HEARD REFERENCE CALLED CANS -- IT IS A NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT IS BEING PERFORMED FOR CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE AND ALSO BEING USED IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM SO THAT THE TOOL THE TWO TOOLS THAT OUR SYSTEMS ARE USING ARE. NOT IDENTICAL BUT THEY HAVE A LOT OF OVERLAP AND SO ON COUNTIES ON THE CHILD WELFARE SIDE HAVE BEEN GIVEN SOME CHOICES ABOUT HOW TO IMPLEMENT THAT. SOME COUNTIES ARE DOING IT INTEGRATED WAY WHERE THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLINICIAN COMPLETES THE WHOLE THING BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THERE REALLY TALKING ENGAGING IN SOME COUNTIES THE SOCIAL WORKER WHO IS ASSIGNED TO THE CASE IS DOING. THAT ASSESSMENT ON THE SORT OF CHILD WELFARE SIDE AND THEN THEY LATER GET TOGETHER AND TALK ABOUT IT WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND IT FEEDS INTO THE CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMS THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT TODAY SO YOU GET -- THAT SORT OF TRACING THROUGH OF THOSE ASSESSMENTS AND IT'S NOT JUST ONE CONVERSATION UP FRONT WHERE YOU JUST OBSERVE AND YOU NEVER REALLY HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AGAIN THE INTENT IS FOR THIS TO BE. AN ONGOING CONVERSATION WHERE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS ARE ASSESSED AND TALKED ABOUT ON A REGULAR BASIS. I THINK -- WHAT WE'VE ALSO SEEN AND YOU'VE HEARD REFERENCE A FEW TIMES TODAY IS WITH THE PASSAGE OF EIGHTY THREE FORTY BY DOCTOR ARAMBULA A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO? THAT IS A BILL THAT REQUIRES THE SCREENING TOOLS THAT BAD THAT DOCTORS USE THROUGH THE EARLY AND PERIODIC SCREENING DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS A REQUIREMENT UNDER MEDICAID AND ALL OF SIR CARE. ON IT APPLIES -- TO CHANGING THE SCREENING TOOLS FOR THE ENTIRE MEDICAID POPULATION EVERY CHILD THAT WE SEE IS ENTITLED TO THESE SERVICES. ARE ARE FOSTER CHILDREN YOUTH ARE SUBSET OF THAT AND SO YOU KNOW WE'VE GONE FARTHER I THINK WITHOUT LEGISLATION TO INCLUDE ALL OF THE CHILDREN BUT CERTAINLY FOR OUR CHILDREN YOUTH WHERE WE KNOW THAT THAT TRAUMA HAS BEEN -- LIKELY IN SOME FASHION ON EXPERIENCE TO A GREATER OR LESSER DEGREE BUT TO SOME DEGREE MAKING SURE THAT WERE ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AT THE RIGHT POINTS IN TIME FOR THE CHILDREN YOU CAN IDENTIFY THINK. EVEN FASTER AT THE AT THE SORT OF DOCTOR PRACTITIONER LEVEL THAT SOMETHING'S GOING ON WITH THESE CHILDREN -- I THINK ON THE COORDINATION OF SERVICES I THINK THE EFFORTS ARE CONTINUING TO IMPROVE THIS WE ARE HEARING TODAY AND I THINK YOU SEE DIFFERENT STRUCTURES ACROSS DIFFERENT COUNTIES. AND THEY ARE SEEKING THEIR BEST TO MAKE IT WORK -- I THINK IT'SSTILL NOT FULLY WHERE WE'D LIKE IT AS FAR AS MAKING SURE THAT OUR TIME LINES ARE ON THE SAME I THINK YOU JUST HEARD. SOMETIMES WE DON'T GET THOSE ASSESSMENTS RIGHT AWAY OR OUR CHILD WELFARE AND THE COURT PROCESS IS ON PERHAPS A FASTER TIMELINE THEN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM AB. AND MENTIONING THAT DIVERT DEVELOPMENTAL SYSTEM THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM IS EVEN A LONGER SET OF TIME LINES AND YOU CAN HAVE CO OCCURRING ISSUES YOU CAN HAVE A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY OF SOME KIND. AND BE ELIGIBLE FOR REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES AND ALSO HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE THAT COULD BE TREATED THROUGH THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM AS WELL AS ALL OF THOSE THINGS REALLY NEED TO KIND OF CLICKED TOGETHER. TO MAKE IT WORK FOR CHILDREN I DO WANNA GIVE A LITTLE PLUG -- FOR ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY WE WORK TO GET SHARE THIS IS -- AIMED AT THE HIGHEST NEED THE MOST TRAUMATIZE YOU IT'S NOT THE MAJORITY OF THE YOUTH THAT WE SERVE BUT IT'S THOSE THAT ARE RECEIVING SERVICES ARE NEED TO BE RECEIVING SERVICES ACROSS MULTIPLE SYSTEMS. AND IT HASN'T BEEN WORKING AS WELL AS IT COULD AND SO THIS LEGISLATION WHICH WAS SIGNED -- WAS VERY HAPPY ABOUT -- SO WE'RE JUST ON THE FRONT END OF IT BUT THE IDEA IS TO TRY TO GET LOCALLY SOME RULES OF ENGAGEMENT SET OUT FOR WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ONE OF THOSE HIGHLY TRAUMATIZE YOUTH. COURT WE KNOW WE'RE GONNA NEED SERVICES ACROSS SYSTEMS AND THAT INCLUDES EDUCATION DD IN THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM AS WELL AS UP COUNTY HEALTH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM -- WE WORK TOGETHER ONE OF THE SILLY BRINGING A NEW SERVICE TO THE TABLE THAT WE DON'T ALREADY OFFER BUT WHAT WE HAVE WE NEED TO TALK TOGETHER ABOUT HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S BEING PROVIDED TO THOSE HERE. THERE'S ALSO A STATE LEVEL COMPONENT TO THAT AS WELL WHICH WERE VERY EXCITED ABOUT TO CONTINUE SOME DISCUSSIONS THAT STARTED LATE IN THE SESSION AT THE STATE LEVEL I'M CAN BE IN BY THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY WITH ALL OF THOSE. ELEMENT RIGHT STATE LEVEL PLAYERS AROUND THE TABLE TO SEE WHY DON'T OUR TIMELINES MATCH UP IS THERE A SITUATION WE CAN MAKE SOME CHANGES TO POLICY TO MAKE THIS WORK SO. AT THE BEGINNING OF A JOURNEY ON THAT AND THINKING ABOUT HOW THAT CAN ALSO ALTERNATELY TRACE THROUGH TO THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE TO ALL OF THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN OUR SYSTEM NOT JUST TO THOSE REALLY HIGH LEVEL. NEEDS YOUTH I HOPE THAT IT PUTS STRUCTURES IN PLACE THAT CAN WORK TO TO EXPAND THOSE COORDINATED EFFORTS AS WELL -- AND I THINK FINALLY ON TO SORT OF GETTING INTO THAT -- THIRD PIECE OF TWENTY EIGHTY THREE IT'S A CURRENT LEVEL COFFEE FOR CREW BEING -- YOU KNOW EDUCATED DEGREED SOCIAL WORK PROFESSIONALS TRAINING IS NEEDED ON GOING WE HAVE A A CORE PRACTICE MODEL WE WORK VERY CLOSELY THE CALIFORNIA SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION CENTER -- BUT THINGS ARE CHANGING ALL THE TIME AND THE CONTINUAL NEED FOR TRAINING IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND NOT WELL SUPPORTED NOW I THINK AT THE STATE LEVEL SO THIS IS A CONVERSATION TED TO DEFINITELY KEEP KIND OF TOP OF MIND FOR BUDGET DISCUSSIONS OF LEGISLATIVE WILL BUT IT'S NOT JUST. A AND IF I MAY OF NOT JUST THE TRAINING PART BECAUSE I IN MY MY STEP DAUGHTER GRADUATED FROM A UNIVERSITY OF THE VERNE. IN SOCIAL WORK I WENT TO LA COUNTY DID THE WHOLE TRAINING PROGRAM. SPENT THE WEEK AND SAID I CAN'T DO THAT SINCE IT'S AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT JOB YOU'RE SO RIGHT I ACTUALLY MARRIED TO AN LCSW RECENTLY LICENSED IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS SO YEAH HIM. AND HE HAS PROVIDED SERVICES MORE ON THE BEHAVIOR HAVE CITING THE CLINICIAN AND IT'S BEEN A IT'S BEEN SO THE POLICE WORK WITH HOMELESS YOUTH POPULATIONS HE HIMSELF GETS TRAUMA I YOU KNOW YOU GO INTO THESE SITUATIONS. SO HELPING WITH SELF CARE AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT REALLY IS THIS JOB AND I KNOW LIKE -- LOS ANGELES HAS A LAB A SIMULATION LAB WHERE THEY BRING SOCIAL WORKERS AND WORK WITH THEM HERE IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO ENCOUNTER HERE'SHOW YOU CAN THINK ABOUT HANDLING THAT -- LET'S SEE HOW WE CAN TAKE THOSE IS THAT STATE WIDE AND REALLY ENSURE THAT WORK TRAINING UP A REALLY EXCELLENT GENERATION AND THEN HOW DO WE RETAIN THEM AND MAKING SURE THAT. PART OF IT I DON'T THINK WAS SO MUCH THE FACT THAT OF THE WE'RE COMING I THINK THE WORK SHE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO I THINK THE AMOUNT THE CASE WORK. AND GOES BACK TO THE AT THE THE HIDE. A MAD THE BIG LOADS OF OF THIS CASE WORK THAT THEY'RE OVERWHELMED AND YOU KNOW TO THE POINT OF THAT GOT THAT IN A MADE -- WEEK WE CAN TRAIN THEM BUT IF THERE'S SO MANY IN THEIR CASE LOAD HOW DO THEY DECIDE WHO IS FIRST AND WHO IS SECOND AND WHO DO THE FOSTER USED. GO TO A THEY DON'T FEEL SUPPORTED BECAUSE THERE REALLY AREN'T I MEAN IF YOU HAVE. FIFTY TWO ONE I MEAN THAT'S KIND OF OUT OF HAND WHICH GOES BACK TO THE I THOUGHT THAT VICIOUS CIRCLE GOES BACK TO THE FUNDING IF WE DON'T FIND THEM PROPERTY THEN THE CASE -- KEEPS GOING UP AND UP AND UP AND THEN NOT ONLY ARE THE CASE WORKERS OVERWHELMED BUT THAT THE KIDS ARE NOT GETTING THE THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE THE SORT OF BOTTOM LINE AS AM I SERVING ALL OF THE YOUTH THAT I NEED TO BE SERVING IN. A WAY THAT I FEEL GOOD ABOUT AND IT IN MANY PLACES IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE AND I THINK WE'RE SEEING FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE EXTENDED FOSTER CARE POPULATION. THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WERE MADE ABOUT HOW MUCH -- SOCIAL WORK SERVICE WOULD BE NEEDED BY THESE ADULTS YOU KNOW I THINK WHEN WE WERE DOING AB TWELVE TEN YEARS AGO TEN PLUS -- SO HE EIGHT EIGHT YEARS AGO -- WE THOUGHT YOU KNOW THEY'RE ADULTS ANOTHER HERE'S THE YOU KNOW KIND OF PERCENTAGES THAT WE ASSUME BASED ON ILLINOIS AND WE'VE SEEN OUR PARTICIPATION RATES WELL PAST THAT WE SORT OF BLEW THROUGH THOSE ORIGINAL. ESTIMATES AND I THINK THE ESTIMATES OF HOW -- READY THOSE YOUTH WOULD BE TO KIND OF DO IT ON THEIR OWN WITH JUST A LITTLE HELP FROM US FINANCIALLY -- WE'VE BEEN TALKING INTERNALLY AS WELL ABOUT HOW DO WE LOOK AT THAT AREA OF SOCIAL WORK AND OUR ASSUMPTIONS ARE AND HOW MANY CASES THEY WOULD HANDLE UP VERSES THE REALITY OF THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO REALLY. MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT JUST DROPPING THIS YOUTH OFTEN OF ANOTHER A CLIFF WHEN THEY TURN TWENTY ONE SO IT'S A DEFINITE ONGOING ISSUE AND I WANT TO SAY TO WORK THINKING ABOUT AT THE PRACTITIONER LEVEL -- AND I KNOW IT WAS MENTIONED IN A COUPLE OF THE PANELS -- INSURING THAT WE HAVE THERAPIST DOCTORS ABOUT PROGRAMS THAT CAN SERVE OUR YOUTH AND THERE'S WAITING LISTS THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF PROVIDERS IT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU LIVE IF YOU CAN GET INTO -- ONE MORE REGULARLY AND SO THINKING ABOUT WAYS AND THIS IS ONE OF THE TASKS AND TWENTY EIGHTY THREE AS FOR THAT STATE LEVEL GROUP TO SAY. HOW DO WE GROW HOW DO WE YOU KNOW CREATE MORE TRAUMA INFORMED PRACTITIONERS WHO ARE ABLE TO SERVE OUR YOUTH BECAUSE HAVING -- AN IDENTIFIED NEED IS GREAT BUT NOT IF YOU CAN'T TREAT IT FOR MONTHS AND GET SOMEBODY AND ON A REGULAR BASIS TO RECEIVE THAT ONGOING SERVICE -- I THINK JUST ONE OTHER THING THAT I'D LIKE TO MENTION IS -- THE THE SORT OF POLL COUPLE THINGS ABOUT THE PROMISE OF CCIR THE CONTINUUM OF CARE FORM ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROMISES THAT I THINK WAS MADE IN THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. WHAT THE STATE WITH THE LEGISLATURE WITH COUNTY HE IS YOU KNOW IT'S NOT ALL GOING TO BE AND THAT SORT OF GROUP CARE MODEL WE'RE GONNA HAVE A CONTINUUM AND WE'RE GONNA STEP YOUTH AND THE FAMILIES ARE GOING TO KEEP THEM IN FAMILIES? AND FAMILY TYPES OF PROVIDERS LIKE A RELATIVE CARE GIVERS ARE A FAMILY HOME TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE AND WE ARE GOING TO BRING THOSE SERVICES TO THEM. THEY'RE GOING TO GET THOSE SERVICES THAT ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO FAIL OUT OR HAVE THE COPS CALLED ON THEM AND HAVE THEM AND UP IN A CONGREGATE CARE FACILITY. AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE REALLY SEEKING TO DO WITH -- STUFF LIKE AB TWENTY FORTY THREE THE FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM THAT DR ARAMBULA MENTIONED WHICH UNFORTUNATELY WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR ON THE IDEA IS WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HELP PRESERVE PLACEMENTS. BY PRESERVING THE FAMILIES AND ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE A PLACE TO CALL IF SOMETHING HAPPENS SOMETIMES AT THE BRAND NEW PLACEMENT AND THE FOSTER PARENTS AND THE YOUTH THEY DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER. THERE MAY BE A TRIGGERING EVENT THAT HAPPENS JUST BY A THAT THEY'D JUST FROM SOMETHING THAT THE FOSTER PARENTS SAYS THAT THAT THAT WAS OF RELATED TO THE ABUSE AND THESE GUYS ALL IT'S ANOTHER PLACE IT'S NOT GONNA WORK FOR ME. AND THINGS CAN ESCALATE AND GET OUT OF CONTROL UNFORTUNATELY THE POLICE CAN GET CALLED AND WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU CROSS OVER TO JUVENILE JUSTICE WE WANT TO AVOID THAT WHENEVER POSSIBLE WE WANT TO AVOID HAVING THAT PLACEMENT IS ROB. AND HAVING THAT YOU'VE COME BACK GO TO ANOTHER PLACE AND END UP WITH THIRTY TWO PLACE THAT NONE OF THAT IS GOOD WE WANT TO CHANGE THAT AND SO. THE IDEA IS -- OUT AT STAFF HOTLINE FRAME WITH PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND OUR FOSTER YOUTH UNDERSTAND OUR SYSTEM AND CAN HELP DEFUSE THE SITUATION. ON AND ROLL OUT A MOBILE RESPONSE TEAM IN ANY COUNTY. TWENTY FOUR HOURS IF SOMETHING IS NEEDED TO GET IN THERE TO HAVE SOME THERAPY TO HAVE SOME PROVIDE NEEDED AND THEN THE FOLLOW UP TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A PLAN IN PLACE. ONGOING YOU KNOW SORT OF ONE THE CRITICAL THING WE SENIOR STATES NEW JERSEY SIMILAR STRUCTURE THEY ACTUALLY OFFER TO EVERY CHILD THE COURSE TO JERSEY IS MUCH SMALLER THAN CALIFORNIA SO. THEY WERE ABLE TO DO THAT -- AND THE CITY OF MILWAUKEE HAS A SIMILAR KIND OF EFFORT AS WELL SO WE THINK THAT IT'S VERY PROMISING IN THE MEANTIME -- A LOT OF COUNTIES ARE USING THEIR FOSTER PARENT RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION MONEY WE CAUGHT DIPPERS SIZED SORRY FOR THE ACRONYM. ON THINGS LIKE THE VENTURA UP HERE PARTNERS -- IS FOR IS FUNDED RIGHT NOW THROUGH THAT FUNDING WHICH IS GOING TO BE ENDING AT THE END OF THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR SO YOU CAN BUT WILL HAVE A CONVERSATION I THINK AROUND THAT BOTH IN THE POLICY IN FISCAL COMMITTEES. TO SAY ARE WE THERE YET IT TAKES A LOT TO BUILD A SYSTEM THAT CAN SUPPORT THE FAMILIES AND THE YOUTH IN A FAMILY SETTING AND ENABLE THEM TO STEPOUT OF THE S. T. R. T. P. TYPE OF FACILITY OR AVOID IT IF. AT ALL TOGETHER WE HAVE TO HAVE THE SERVICES IN PLACE THEY HAVE TO BE IN A WELL INFORMED BY THE NEEDS OF OUR YOUTH AND WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THEM ON TIME AND WITHOUT THAT ON THIS WHOLE THING IT JUST ISN'T GOING TO WORK LIKE IT. SHOULD. STOP THEIR THANKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THANK YOU WE WILL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATIONS I'M SURE YES ORDERS A SAY SHE PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN TWENTY EIGHTY THREE AND MAKING THE CASE SO THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND I I DID NOTE THAT IT WAS IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER. BUT I ALSO THOUGHT YOU KNOW JUST KEEP THE FOCUS ON THE WHOLE SYSTEM IN OUR WORK CELLS. THANK YOU FOR THE SHOUT OUT ON YOUR THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST. WE HAVE OUR ME GET MY LIST HERE CAN. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU -- I LOVE GOING LAST BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY SAID. ME. TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT EASIER -- AND BY THE WAY OF I'M FAMILY THE AGENCIES AND WE'RE MULTI SERVICE AGENCY THAT CROSSES EDUCATION CHILD WELFARE MENTAL HEALTH THE JUVENILE JUSTICE WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN A CONTINUE. CONTINUE OF CARE AGENCY SINCE OUR BEGINNING SO THANK YOU. FOR TWENTY EIGHTY THREE BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO MAKE MY LIFE EASIER. AND I JUST I CAN'T I WOULD BE REMISS I'M SO SORRY TO BREAK AND IF I DID ALSO THINK DIANA BORDER WHO IS OUR SEE AMAZING CWD A STAFF IS ARE WE DON'T TELL WELFARE ISSUES. SHE'S HERE IN THE AUDIENCE TODAY AND I JUST WANNA SAY SHE DID SO MUCH LIKE WORK AND SO MUCH BACKGROUND ON THAT SO SORRY I DON'T USUALLY GET TO DO THAT AS THE PERSON WHO SITS AT THE TABLE SO. THANK GOD SORRY BACK -- TO I WANTED STEP BACK FOR JUST A MINUTE AND TELL YOU THAT ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO MY WIFE AND I WERE DOING A PRESENTATION IN SPAIN OF ALL PLACES. ABOUT INNOVATION AND CHILD WELFARE AND CALIFORNIA. AND IN THAT TALK OF IT PERSONAL I WAS PRESENTING WITH MY WIFE WHICH IS SORT OF LIKE BEING STEDMAN EVERYBODY'S WAITING -- FOR BRED A COME ON IT I GOT IT BY THE LONG BECAUSE THEY WANTED HER AND THEY THOUGHT SHE WOULD COME IF I CAME BUT ANYWAY. SO WE'RE PRESENTING AND I WENT PERSON I'M PRESENTING TO THIS AUDIENCE SO MY SPANISH IS AWFUL SO I'M PRESENTING AN ENGLISH THROUGH A TRANSLATOR. AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HEAR IN A ROOM AND YOU'RE NOT CONNECTING WITH AN AUDIENCE AND YOU CAN SEE IT AND AT SOME POINT. WE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND WE STOPPED AND WE SAID. IT SEEMS LIKE YOU MIGHT NOT BE UNDERSTANDING OR YOU MIGHT NOT BE -- KNOWING WHAT QUITE WHAT WE ME INTO THE TRANSLATIONS NOT WORKING AT AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS NEW PHENOMENON OF WRAPAROUND IN CALIFORNIA. THIS VERY NEW SERVICE. ANNA A VERY POLITE WOMAN IN THE BACK OF THE AUDIENCE RAISED HER HAND. AND SIX INCH INTO TRYING TO BE SO KIND SHE SAID WHAT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HERE. YOU MEAN BEFORE YOU HAD THIS WRAPAROUND SERVICE YOU USED TO TAKE CHILDREN AWAY FROM THEIR PARENTS BEFORE YOU HELP THEM. WE WERE IN ONE OF THE MOST FAMILY CENTRIC COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. TELLING THEM THAT WE USED TO TAKE KIDS AWAY BEFORE WE HELP THEIR FAMILIES. NEEDLESS TO SAY THE TALK DID NOT GO WELL. BUT SOME THINGS HAVE GONE REALLY WELL SINCE THEN. SOME THINGS HAVE GONE REALLY WELL WE HAD VIRTUALLY ZERO SLOTS WE AT SOME EXPERIMENTATION AROUND THE STATE. AND NOW BY BEST ESTIMATES THERE ARE AT LEAST EIGHT THOUSAND FLIGHTS A PROPER AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE ABLE TO HELP KIDS IN WAYS THAT WE'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO HELP THEM BEFORE WE'RE ABLE TO HELP THEM ACROSS SYSTEMS SOMETIMES IN WAYS THAT WE'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO HELP THE BEFORE. THAT'S THE GOODNESS AND YOU'RE GONNA GET GOOD NEWS BAD NEWS AND GOODNESS. SO LET'S SAY WE HAVE TEN THOUSAND VOTES BECAUSE NOBODY QUITE KNOWS HOW MANY SLOTS WRAPAROUND WE HAVE. WE STILL HAVE SIXTY TWO THOUSAND KIDS IN OUT OF HOME CARE IN CALIFORNIA. SO WITH EASIER TO GET REMOVED FROM YOUR HOME IN THE STATE. THAT IS TO GET INTENSIVE WRAPAROUND SERVICES. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT PICTURE FOLKS. THERE'S STILL SOMETHING WRONG WE'RE DOING A LOT BETTER. MOST OF THOSE SLOTS ARE USED EITHER FOR STEP DOWN -- AT FROM OUT OF HOME CARE. OR AS A AS A PREVENTION INTERVENTION AFTER REPORT IS MADE THE CPS. BUT I HAVE ON THIS PANEL KIND OF ALL THE PEOPLE I NEED BECAUSE OF TEACHER. EMERGENCY ROOM DOC AND A PERSON WHO HAD SOMEONE IN THEIR HOME THAT DIDN'T GET TO THE SUPPORT THEY NEEDED TO BE SUCCESSFUL. SO IF YOU'RE A TEACHER IN CALIFORNIA AND YOU NEED INTENSIVE IN HOME SERVICES FOR YOUR CHILD. WHAT DO YOU NOTED DO? I GUARANTEE YOU EVERY TEACHER IN THE STATE THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AS AMENDED REPORTER EVERYONE OF THEM DO. AND THEY KNOW HOW TO MAKE A REPORT TYPICALLY THEY'LL GO TO THEIR PRINCIPLE THEY KNOW HOW TO MAKE A REPORT. GO BACK TO DISTRICTS AND ASK THE TEACHER AT RANDOM IF YOU HAVE A FAMILY THAT'S IN TROUBLE. WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO GET THAT FAMILY HELP? AND MOST OF THEM WON'T BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION IN A CLEAR DEFINITIVE SMOOTH WAY. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT PICTURE. SENATE HASHAD THE PRIVILEGE OF DOING A SERIES OF PILOT'S FUNDED BY THE TEACHER A LONG FOUNDATION -- AND AND PUT BY THE GATES FOUNDATION BUT THE THE PARTICULAR ONE I WANT TO TALK TO ABOUT IS IN WEST CONTRA COSTA RICHMOND CALIFORNIA. AND IN THOSE PILOTS WERE ABLE TO TAKE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CHILD WELFARE WE HAD WITH THE WRAPAROUND PROVIDER FOR CONTRA COSTA. WITH THE MOBILE RESPONSE PROVIDER FOR CONTRA COSTA. AND WE'RE MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER FOR CONTRA COSTA. AND PARTNER WITH SCHOOLS THAT ARE AT 809096% FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH. IN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAD SOME OF THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGES OF CPS REPORTS. IN THE IN THE STATE I'M AND CERTAINLY INCOME CONTRA COSTA. IN IN THOSE SCHOOLS THERE'S SOMEONE CALLED IN AND CONDITIONAL EDUCATION COACH. AND THE COACH IS THE PERSON EVERYBODY WANTS TO HANG OUT WITH BECAUSE THERE THE PERSON HAS ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES THAT COACH IS AVAILABLE FOR OFFICE HOURS. AT LEAST THREE DAYS A WEEK AND A DEVIL ONE DAY A WEEK WHEN ANY TEACHER ANY PARENT AND THE STUDENT CAN COME TO THEM WITH THE PROBLEM. AND IT'S THAT COACHES RESPONSIBILITY TO BRING SERVICES TO THAT CHILD AND FAMILY. WHAT WOULD WE WILL BE LIKE SYSTEMICALLY? IF EVERY TEACHER HAD ACCESS TO SOMEONE. WHO COULD GET VERY SMOOTH ACCESS TO SERVICES AND FAMILY A RICH? I CAN TELL YOU ONE OF THE RESULTS. WE HAVE FEWER REPORTS TO CVS. BECAUSE IT'S JUST NOT NECESSARY WHEN YOU CAN HELP A FAMILY RATHER THAN MAKE A CPS REPORT AND YOU CAN DO IT SEAMLESSLY AND I REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE YOU CAN DO IT SEAMLESSLY. BECAUSE IF THERE'S A DELAY YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE CBS REPORT RIGHT IF YOU CAN'T GET SOMEBODY OUT THERE RIGHT AWAY IF YOU CAN'T CALL MOBILE RESPONSE THANK YOU. I HOPE YOU'RE GONNA TRY AGAIN BECAUSE THAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. IF YOU CAN'T CALM OF A RESPONSE THEN YOU'RE FORCED TO CALL CPS FOR ENERGY -- THERE ARE NO BAD PEOPLE OUT THERE WANTING TO DO BAD THINGS. THERE'S NO BAD MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ARE SAYING I DON'T WANT TO SAVE KIDS. BUT THERE'S A HUGE FEAR OF RISK IN OUR SYSTEMS. AND THAT'S WHERE YOU GUYS CAN COME IN. THAT'S THAT'S WHERE WHERE I THINK WE CAN BE HELPFUL IN A DIFFERENT WAY -- BECAUSE WE CAN CREATE A DIFFERENT SYSTEM THAT CAN RESPOND IN MORE PROACTIVE WAY. AND WE CAN'T DO THAT WITH THE SINGLE SYSTEM RESPONSE IT CAN'T BE CHILD WELFARE IS RESPONSIBILITY. IT CAN'T BE EDUCATIONS RESPONSIBILITY AND IT CAN BE MENTAL HEALTH RESPONSIBILITY. WE GIVE YOU ONE MORE PIECE OF GOOD NEWS WE WORK BUT WE DO A LOT OF WORK IN SAN FRANCISCO AND ALAMEDA COUNTIES. YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY KIDS ARE IN THE JUVENILE HALL IN ALAMEDA COUNTY RIGHT NOW. I KNOW IT'S FIFTY EIGHT FIFTY EIGHT WE BUILT A BIG HALL. AND IT'S MOSTLY EMPTY I WANNA DANCE THROUGH THOSE EMPTY. BROOMS AND THAT HALL SOMETIMES BECAUSE I'M IT'S SUCH A HUGE DIFFERENCE FROM WHERE IT WAS WHEN I STARTED WHEN WE USED TO HAVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY KIDS. IN THE JUVENILE HALL AND THEY WOULD STAY THERE FOR VERY LONG PERIODS OF TIME WE'VE DONE THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE M. S. T. WE HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH COURT ALAMEDA COUNTY WE HAVE A WHOLE SERIES OF INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN OCCUR. NOW WE PROBABLY WILL HAVE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN. AROUND TWELVE HUNDRED KIDS THAT WILL COME THROUGH THAT ALL. WE DON'T HAVE AN OF SERVICE FOR ALL OF THOSE KIDS TO RECEIVE ACCESS IN THAT SMOOTH SEAMLESS WAY THAT I'M DESCRIBING CáC. SO IF WE COULD WE ENVISION. A SYSTEM THAT SAYS WE CAN INTEGRATE THESE SERVICES. IN A WAY THAT USES THE MEMORANDUMS OF UNDERSTANDING AND AT AND AND FUNDS -- AND TAKES AWAY RISK OR FUNDS INSTEAD INCENTIVIZE IS RISK FOR COUNTIES TO DO THINGS. THAT ARE NEW -- A WHO'S TALKED ABOUT HOW WONDERFUL THEIR CHAU WAS -- AND THERE'S A LOT OF WONDERFUL CA AS OUT THERE. BUT THIS CHAU HOLD THE MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTOR FISCALLY ACCOUNTABLE. AND THE CHILD WELFARE DIRECTOR AND AT THAT'S THEIR JOB THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. AND WHAT WE CAN DO WHAT YOU CAN DO IS PROVIDE INCENTIVES TO TAKE AWAY THE RISK WHERE IF YOU TRY TO DO SOMETHING NEW AND YOU DON'T GET THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT IMMEDIATELY. AND YOU WON'T. WE KNOW THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT IS THAT IMMEDIATE. YOU CAN HANG IN THERE AND YOU CAN INCENTIVIZE NEW PRACTICES LIKE IN CONDITIONAL EDUCATION LIKE INTEGRATED SERVICE RESPONSE LIKE MOBILE RESPOND -- JUST JUST FINALLY THE THE WISDOM IT'S ALWAYS FUN TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR ONE OF THE PROGRAMS WE RUN. IS A PROGRAM THAT TAKES KIDS OUT OF THE EMERGENCY ROOM WE DO THIS FOR VENTURE IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. AND AND BRINGS THEM IMMEDIATELY INTO A SYSTEM THAT HAS A TWENTY THREE OUR ASSESSMENT. THEY CAN INTERVENE AND THEN NEXT DOOR IN BOTH SITUATIONS IS IN ONE CASE A PUFF INTO THE CASE THAT STR TP. WHERE IF KIDS NEED LONGER TERM UP SUPPORT THEY CAN BE HELPED? WE HAVE A BETTER THAN 50% OF DIVERSION RATE FROM HOSPITALIZATION. BUT THAT'S NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS OUR AMBULANCE WAIT TIME IS AROUND FOUR MINUTES. FOR THAT MEANS ARE AMBULANCES GET BACK ON THE STREET THAT MEANS THE KIDS ARE IN RESRAINTS GET PULLED OUT OF RESTRAINTS VERY QUICKLY. AND SAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PAIN IT ALSO MEANS THAT KIDS DON'T SIT IN A WAITING ROOM. ABOUT 45% OF THE KIDS THAT COME TO US COME TO CHILD WELFARE. THE KIDS ARE IN CHILD WELFARE THE REALLY CUTE CRISIS. THAT KIND OF PRACTICE SHOULD SHOULD BE STATEWIDE AND IT AND AND THAT KIND OF PRACTICE WHEN YOU PAIR IT WITH MOBILE RESPONSE. WHERE MOST OF THE KIDS DON'T NEED TO EVEN COME TO THE TWENTY THREE HOURS CENTER CAN BE VERY POWERFUL AND REDUCING THE NUMBER OF KIDS THAT COME IN THE CHILD WELFARE? SO WE HAVE INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITIES AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT. THANK YOU ANY. QUESTIONS COMMENTS DR ARAMBULA NO I SOMETIMES IT SEEMS THAT WERE OF A PENNY WISE BUT POUND FOOLISH. RIGHT AND WE ALL KNOW THAT AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION CAN REALLY. IS WORTH A POUND OF CURE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AS A STATE AND FRANKLY RESPONSIBILITY TO TALK ABOUT THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU ARE. ELICITING HERE BUT WILL SOMETIMES IT IS FRUSTRATING TO LOOK AT WHAT WASN'T ACCOMPLISH THIS YEAR I DO WANT TO AGREE WITH YOU THERE IS SOME LIGHT OUT THERE AS WELL -- YOU KNOW I WANTED TO FOCUS A LITTLE BIT ON FEB FIRST BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU HAD SAID KATHY AND JUST WANTED -- TO WAY IN A LITTLE BIT FOR THE REST OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE IS THAT WILL HALF WHAT'S THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF REMOVING OF THAT AND WHAT SHOULD WE EXPECT. OVER THE NEXT YEAR TO TO WITH THE REMOVAL OF THOSE PAPERS FUNDS. SURE I'M HAPPY THAT TO START TACKLING THAT THE SO SO FIRST I WANT TO JUST SAY AS THAT SORT OF POINT OF COMPARISON. THERE WAS A RECENT FEDERAL LAW I'M AN ACTOR CALL THE FAMILY FIRST ACT AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE FAMILY FIRST ACT DOES IS MAKE A LOT OF CHANGES. TO HOW STATES ARE ALLOWED TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL TITLE FOR EACH FUNDING FOR GROUP CARE PLACEMENTS AND IT CREATES A SYSTEM THAT'S GONNA SOUND VERY SIMILAR WHEN YOU START HEARING MORE ABOUT IT NOT THE POINT OF THIS HEARING. ON TO WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IN CCR BUT THERE'S SOME -- CAM DEVIATIONS FROM THOSE -- FROM WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT WE THINK CAN I GET IN OUR WAY AND SO IT'S FRUSTRATING AND WE WERE NOT HAPPY WITH THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE FEDERAL BILL WANTS TO DO IS TO REDUCE PLACEMENT AND CONGREGATE CARE JUST LIKE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THE C. R.. WE WHAT THE BILL CONTAINS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS NINE MILLION DOLLARS FOR STATES TO RECRUIT FOSTER PARENTS. AND AND RELATIVES AND WE'VE SPENT I MEAN AT THE TIME THE BILL WAS INITIALLY PUTTING THROUGH WE'D SPENT ABOUT THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON THAT JUST IN CALIFORNIA ALONE. AND NOW IT'S WILL ABOUT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH IT BECAUSE NUMBER ONE WE HAVE MORE NUMBERS OBVIOUSLY -- BUT YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A TO GO AND I THINK BOTH ON THE LICENSED FOSTER PARENTS SIDE AND ON THE RELATIVE SIDE. YOU HAVE NEEDS OF THOSE CARE GIVERS TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEM AND A GOOD EXAMPLE I NOTICED THAT SORT OF HARKEN BACK TO THE INITIAL SPEAKER ON THE PANEL -- ONE OF THE IMPORTANT CHANGES THAT WE MADE THIS YEAR WAS -- AS PART OF THE BUDGET TO APPROVE AND YOU HAD A BILL -- WAS TO ALLOW PAYMENTS AT THE TIME OF PLACEMENT TORE RELATIVE CARE GIVERS SO THE HUGE CHANGE WE KNOW THAT THE RFA PROCESS IS SIGNIFICANT. AND OUR RELATIVES ARE BEING ASKED TO GO THROUGH A LOT OF TRAINING THAT THEY NEVER HAD TO GO THROUGH WE'RE GETTING GREAT COMMENTS BACK THAT THE TRAINING IS SO HELPFUL WHY DIDN'T I GET THIS BEFORE KIND OF THINGS. SO WE THINK THAT IT IS THE RIGHT THING BUT IT IS TAKING LONGER THAN WEWANTED -- TO WE KNOW THE NUMBERS ARE GOING DOWN I DON'T HAVE THEM NOW I DIDN'T GET THAT BEFORE THE HEARING BUT WE'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT BUT WE ARE DOING FASTERNOW THAT WE'VE MADE SOME STREAMLINING CHANGES TO THE PROCESS. BUT IT'S STILL TAKING LONGER THAN WE WANT AT ANY DAY ANY TIME MORE THAN LIKE A DAY WAS NOT. READY FOR THE RELATIVE CARE GIVERS FROM WHAT WE GET FROM A LICENSE PLATE PARENT THOSE FOLKS THEY THOUGHT ABOUT IT TAPES ON ADD MAYBE ONE OTHER FRIEND SAID ADOPTED OR HAD BEEN A FOSTER PARENT I CAN DO THAT. TOO AND SO THEY CAME IN AND IN ADVANCE THEY WENT THROUGH ALL OF THAT PROCESS SO THEY'RE READY TO GO AND SO HAVING -- A GREATER UNDERSTANDING LIKE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT FAMILIES AND THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH THE FUNDS FOR THOSE PARENTS. TO SUPPORT THOSE PARENTS WITH TAKING ADDITIONAL CLASSES SAY -- SAY THAT THEY HAVE -- NOT REALLY HAD EXPERIENCE WITH THE YOUTH WHO IDENTIFIES AS TRANSGENDER AND NOW THE BLIGHTED TO TACKLE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THERE WERE SOME ABUSE RELATED TO THAT. I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW TO BE THOUGHTFUL AND BE CARING CAN YOU HELP ME. GET SOME MORE TRAINING AND THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD DO WITH THOSE FUNDS ON BOTH RELATIVES A NON RELATIVE CARE GIVERS WE COULD PROVIDE RESPITE -- ESSENTIALLY ENABLE THEM TO HIRE A BABYSITTER MAYBE TAKE A VACATION HAVE SOMEONE THAT WE ALL FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THAT CHILD STAYING WITH FOR THAT TIME. ON TO GIVE THEM A BREAK BASICALLY ON A LOT OF TIMES -- WE CAN ALSO PAY FOR THE KID ON VACATION WITH THEM THEIR FAMILY AND SO IF MAYBE IT WOULD BE COST PROHIBITIVE FOR THEM WE CAN STEP IN AND WE CAN PAY FOR OTHER SORT OF ACTIVITIES FOR THE YOUTH WITH US FUNDS -- ON THE RELATIVE SIDE IN ADDITION TO SUPPORTING THOSE RELATIVES NOW FROM DAY ONE A WHICH IS KIND OF OUTSIDE OF FLIPPERS -- WE ALSO CAN SUPPORT THE NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE THAT MAY NOT BE THE SAME AS A FOSTER PARENT WHO'S BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS -- IT COULD BE -- YOU KNOW WHAT I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A BEDROOM SET UP FOR THAT KID I'D CONVERTED THAT INTO AN OFFICE I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS GOING TO BE TAKING AND MY NIECE OR NEPHEW. AND SO THERE CAN BE JUST SORT OF TANGIBLE SUPPORT SITE SO YOU ONLY FINDING ACTIVITIES WE WANT TO DO THE BEST JOB WE CAN'T IDENTIFY AS MANY RELATIVES FOR THESE CHILDREN WHEN THEY FIRST COME INTO CARE. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT COUNTIES HAVE USE THOSE FUNDS FOR AND THEN GENERALLY RECRUITMENT TRYING TO GET MORE FOSTER PARENTS TO STEP UP AND COME IN AND BECOME PARENTS BECAUSE WE WE DO HAVE A SHORTAGE I THINK. SOME OF IT IS VERY SPECIFIC LIKE WE SAW IN I THINK LOS ANGELES WHEN WE HAD SUCH A HIGHER TAKE OPERATE ON ON THE A. B. TWELVE THE EXTENDED FOSTER CARE. ON THOSE YOU STAYED IN THEIR FOSTER PLACEMENT AND THAT WAS AMAZING I MEAN THAT WAS GREAT THEY HAD THIS LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH THOSE PARENTS THEY WANTED TO STAY THERE. AND SO THAT WAS EXCELLENT BUT WHAT THAT MEANT WAS WHEREAS BEFORE AB TWELVE AT EIGHTEEN THAT YOUTH WOULD HAVE BEEN CAUGHT AND WE WOULD HAVE HAD THAT HOME TO PLACE WITH WE DON'T HAVE THEM ANYMORE SO NOW WE NEED TO REPLACE THEM. SO WE'RE SORT OF WORKING THROUGH A LOT OF THOSE TYPES OF ISSUES SO THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE CAN USE THOSE FUNDS. FOR THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO SHIFT FUNDS OR SHIP SERVICES FROM OTHER AREAS TO BUILD TO MAKE UP FOR BECAUSE THE WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO IN HIS AREA IS NOT YET COMPLETE WE DON'T HAVE A PLACE THAT'S WELL SUPPORTED. THAT WE CAN COUNT ON TO RETAIN AND TO BE THERE FOR ALL OF OUR YOUTH AS WE MOVE THEM OUT OF THESE HOMES THAT ARE GOING AWAY OR AS THEY REMAIN IN THE HOMES PASS EIGHTEEN TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT WE NEED TO REPLACE THOSE SO THOSE ARE SOME. EXAMPLES THAT I HOPE FOR HELPFUL ONE LAST THING I JUST WANTED TO SAY IS THAT YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN OUR CHILDREN AND YOUTH TRANSITION OUT OF CONGREGATE CARE INTO A HOME SETTING WE ALSO SEE. A RETURN TO OLD BEHAVIORS AND SO THE WHOLE IDEA OF TRANSITION PLANNING WELL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S WORKED INCREDIBLY WELL IN LA COUNTY THROUGH THE OFFICE OF CHILD PROTECTION. IS KIND OF MORE FRONT END THROUGH THE XCELERATED PLACEMENT TEAM AT DCFS A LOT OF FUN AND WORK WITH THE FOSTER PARENTS LIKE HAVING A SIT DOWN WITH ALL THE PROVIDERS BEFORE -- THE CHILD OR YOUTH EVEN GOES INTO THE HOME AND THEN CONTINUING THE MOBILE RESPONSE THROUGHOUT THAT BUT TO TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A WITH THE FOSTER AND SO SPRINT'S KNOWS WE'RE NOT GOING AWAY DAY IN HERE KNOWING THAT IT'S GOING TO GET TOUGH WITH ALL OF THE ATTACHMENT ISSUES AN INSTITUTIONALIZATION THAT HAPPENS -- AND SO IT'S GREAT TO HEAR THE THINGS YOU'RE SAYING BUT THE BIGGEST SUCCESS I'VE HAD WITH A REALLY HARD TO PLACE YOUTH INCLUDING TRANS YOUTH. WHO -- THERE'S A HUGE REJECT REJECTION PIECE THERE AND NOT FEELING COMFORTABLE AND IT TAKES HOME AFTER HOME AFTER HOME AFTER HOME TO FIND A PLACEMENT WHERE A LOT OF THESE -- YOU FEEL SAFE AND SO -- I JUST THINK MORE WORK ON THE FRONT END HAS REALLY MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE TO MAINTAIN STABILITY. IF IF I MAY THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT FURS AND THANK YOU FOR THAT DAY. SOMETIMES WHICH WE WOULD HAVE HAD MORE OF THAT BEFORE. THE VETO BUT THAT'S FOR ANOTHER YEAR -- YOU KNOW IN THE E. R. I WAS HAD TO COME UP WITH A PLAN FOR WHEN THERE WAS A CRISIS. HOW DO WE NOT EXPECT THERE TO BE CRISES? WITHIN OUR FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND WHAT'S OUR RESPONSES A STATE. DOES IT MEET THE NEED OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND YOU KNOW DO WE HAVE THE RIGHT SOLUTION IS A STATE I THOUGHT FIRST WAS ONE OF THOSE THAT REALLY ALLOW US. TO LISTEN TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND RESPOND IN MOMENTS WHEN WE NEEDED HELP THE MOST -- IF I MAY. CREATING SOME FLEXIBILITY WITH IN THE SYSTEMS -- IT ONE OF THE THE BEST WAYS TO GET BETTER ACCESS TO WRAP AROUND. UP BELIEVE IT OR NOT IS TO SAY THAT. THESE CAN COME BACK AND A WRAPAROUND FOSTER FAMILIES CAN COME BACK INTO WRAPAROUND ON DEMAND. AND AND IT IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY GET BETTER THAT MUCH FASTER. NOBODY'S AFRAID THAT IF THEY CLOSE THE CASE THAT THEY'LL HAVE TO GO TO A VERY LONG. TO WIND UP TO COME BACK IN. SO WE EIGHT THIS SORT OF THE SYSTEMIC RESPONSE THAT SAYS WE'VE GOT YOUR BACK. AND WILL COME IN AND PROVIDE WHATEVER SUPPORTS NECESSARY -- IT ACTUALLY CREATES MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE SYSTEM SO THAT PEOPLE CAN COME IN AND OUT RATHER THAN HAVING LONGER LENGTH OF STAY. THANK YOU K. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. OKAY WELL AT THIS POINT -- WE ARE GOING TO OPEN FOR PUBLIC COMMENT -- JUST TO BE SENSITIVE OF THE TIME -- WE ARE SCHEDULED TO AND AT FOUR THIRTY BUT WE'RE PAST THAT BUT KNOW THAT WE ARE AVAILABLE -- AT ALL TIMES THE COMMITTEE IS -- AVAILABLE TO KIND OF DRAFTING HEALTHCARE AVAILABLE IT AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO REQUEST IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS BECAUSE THIS IS A LOT.
