UTILIZING THE AYE ESOS- NEED

00:23:59.638 --> 00:24:01.106
ANALYSIS THAT CAME OUT OF THIS

00:24:01.173 --> 00:24:02.307
THE SELECTION PROCESS THAT WHICH

00:24:02.374 --> 00:24:03.842
IS VERY THOROUGH SO THERE'S

00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:06.178
ISSUES REGARDING IS IT NEEDED

00:24:06.244 --> 00:24:06.812
FOR POLICY REASONS THAT'S WHERE%

00:24:06.878 --> 00:24:08.847
WOULD COME UP. THE P. YOU SEE

00:24:08.914 --> 00:24:10.282
WOULD NOT HAVE TO RE LITIGATE

00:24:10.348 --> 00:24:12.083
THOSE ISSUES UP IN OTHER WORDS

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:13.118
THAT SAVES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

00:24:13.185 --> 00:24:14.653
OF TIME BECAUSE I'M ASSUMING

00:24:14.719 --> 00:24:16.421
THAT IF PEOPLE HAVE OBJECTIONS

00:24:16.488 --> 00:24:17.856

00:24:17.923 --> 00:24:19.558
RIGHT WITH THE AND THERE'S- A

00:24:19.624 --> 00:24:21.359
FORM AVAILABLE TO RAISE THOSE

00:24:21.426 --> 00:24:23.028
ISSUES BUT AGAIN THESE HAVE

00:24:23.094 --> 00:24:24.830
TENDED TO BE A HIGHLY TECHNICAL

00:24:24.896 --> 00:24:26.464
OF THE DETAIL IN THE DIVIDEND

00:24:26.531 --> 00:24:28.667
AGAIN- PART OF THAT PROCESS IS

00:24:28.733 --> 00:24:30.735
IT'S COMPETITIVE AS WELL SO IF

00:24:30.802 --> 00:24:32.037
THAT LINE IT REALLY ISN'T

00:24:32.103 --> 00:24:34.039
NEEDED. THAT COULD BE DISPLACED

00:24:34.105 --> 00:24:35.207
BY SOMETHING ELSE THAT GENERALLY

00:24:35.273 --> 00:24:37.876
HAPPENS THAT PROCESS SO WHAT IT

00:24:37.943 --> 00:24:41.112

00:37:09.627 --> 00:37:11.195
REALITY THAT SOLAR INSTALLERS

00:37:11.262 --> 00:37:13.464
ARE NOT PAID AS MUCH AS OTHER

00:37:13.531 --> 00:37:14.665
ELECTRICAL WORKERS THERE ARE A

00:37:14.732 --> 00:37:16.233
NUMBER OF EXAMPLES FROM THE LAST

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.436
DECADE OF LARGE COMPANIES THAT

00:37:18.502 --> 00:37:20.471
HAVE USED INNOVATION AS AN

00:37:20.538 --> 00:37:22.473
EXCUSE TO DRIVE DOWN WAGES FROM

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:25.109
RIDE SHARE TO WAREHOUSE WORK.

00:37:25.176 --> 00:37:26.877
AND THIS IS ACTUALLY A REALITY

00:37:26.944 --> 00:37:29.280
THAT WE CANNOT ACCEPT AS WE MOVE

00:37:29.347 --> 00:37:32.516
FORWARD TO A CLEAN ENERGY

00:37:32.583 --> 00:37:34.185
ECONOMY. CAN HAS BEEN A WORLD

00:37:34.251 --> 00:37:36.220
LEADER AND CLEAN GREEN ENERGY

00:37:36.287 --> 00:37:38.022
WOULD NOT ONLY INVESTMENTS BUT

00:37:38.089 --> 00:37:39.824
ALSO IN THE PLANNING NECESSARY

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:41.926
TO GET TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT.

00:37:41.993 --> 00:37:43.794
RENEWABLES BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE

00:37:43.861 --> 00:37:46.230
THAT BILL IS ACTUALLY SB ONE

00:37:46.297 --> 00:37:47.331
HUNDRED WHICH I CO AUTHORED IN

00:37:47.398 --> 00:37:49.233
TWENTY EIGHTEEN. MY FIRST YEAR

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.202
IN THE ASSEMBLY. TE LEGISLATURE

00:37:51.268 --> 00:37:53.170
HAS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THE

00:37:53.237 --> 00:37:54.138
WORK NECESSARY TO REDUCE OUR

00:37:54.205 --> 00:37:55.673
STATE'S CONSUMPTION OF FOSSIL

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:57.274
FUELS. AND THERE HAS BEEN A LOT

00:37:57.341 --> 00:37:58.542
OF CONVERSATION REGARDING THE

00:37:58.609 --> 00:38:01.312
WORK FORCE IN THE FOSSIL FUEL

00:38:01.379 --> 00:38:02.680
INDUSTRY. AS THE STATE MOVES

00:38:02.747 --> 00:38:04.048
AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS THE NEW

00:38:04.115 --> 00:38:06.417
DRILLING OR FRACKING. INCENTIVES

00:38:06.484 --> 00:38:07.985
TOWARDS RENEWABLE ENERGY MUST

00:38:08.052 --> 00:38:10.855
INCLUDE A CLEAN GREEN ENERGY

00:38:10.921 --> 00:38:13.424
WORK FORCE. THIS IS OFTEN

00:38:13.491 --> 00:38:16.360
DISCUSSED AS A JUST TRANSITION

00:38:16.427 --> 00:38:17.695
BUT WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN

00:38:17.762 --> 00:38:19.163
WHEN WE ACTUALLY THINK OF

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:21.365
WORKERS. THIS BILL WILL UNLOCK

00:38:21.432 --> 00:38:23.434
WILL LOCK IN. A FAIR

00:38:23.501 --> 00:38:24.835
COMPENSATION FOR SOLAR

00:38:24.902 --> 00:38:26.037

PUBLIC PROVIDED INCENTIVES. THAT

00:38:29.874 --> 00:38:31.809
NUMBER PROVIDES. THE OTHER

00:38:31.876 --> 00:38:33.811
ACTION OF THIS BILL WILL TAKE ON

00:38:33.878 --> 00:38:35.279
AN ADDRESS A NEED FOR GREATER

00:38:35.346 --> 00:38:37.114
TRANSPARENCY AND COMMUNITY

INCLUSION AROUND THE BENEFITS.

00:38:38.983 --> 00:38:40.017
THAT THE NET ENERGY METERING

00:38:40.084 --> 00:38:42.086
PROGRAM PROVIDES THIS IS ALL

00:38:42.153 --> 00:38:44.388
THROUGH A LENS OF EQUITY. RIGHT

00:38:44.455 --> 00:38:46.223
NOW THE LEGISLATURE DOES NOT

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.292
HAVE GOOD DATA ON ROOFTOP SOLAR.

00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:49.827
UPTAKE IN NEIGHBORHOODS BY

00:38:49.894 --> 00:38:52.329
NEIGHBORHOODS. WHAT WE DO KNOW

00:38:52.396 --> 00:38:53.931
FROM UC BERKELEY STUDY AND THAT

00:38:53.998 --> 00:38:56.634
FROM THE PUC'S OWN REPORT ON

NINETIES ARE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO

BENEFIT FROM THEM. THAT THE

00:39:03.074 --> 00:39:04.475
KASHIF MAKES THE RATE BURDEN

00:39:04.542 --> 00:39:06.544
HIGHER WE ALSO KNOW THAT 2% OF

EVEN WHEN ADJUSTED FOR INCOME.

00:40:03.634 --> 00:40:05.069
THIS IS NOT SURPRISING TO THOSE

00:40:05.136 --> 00:40:06.637
OF US WHO WATCH THESE PROGRAMS

CALIFORNIA SOLAR INITIATIVE.

00:40:20.851 --> 00:40:22.520
THAT PROGRAMS SPENT THREE

00:40:22.586 --> 00:40:26.590
BILLION DOLLARS. ON SUBSIDIZING

DATE. WE'VE DONE THE FIRST SLIDE

00:40:48.746 --> 00:40:50.447
WE'VE DONE JUST ABOUT TWELVE

00:40:50.514 --> 00:40:52.149
THOUSAND MEGAWATTS IN ROOFTOP

00:40:52.216 --> 00:40:54.218
SOLAR UNDER THE NAME PROGRAM HOW

00:40:54.285 --> 00:40:55.986
MUCH OF GOING TO PORTTO PORT

00:40:56.053 --> 00:40:58.722
COMMUNITIES. LESS THAN ONE

00:40:58.789 --> 00:41:01.158
HUNDRED MEGAWATTS HAVE GONE TO

SOLAR HOUSING OR DISADVANTAGED

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:09.066
COMMUNITIES IT'S SHAMEFUL THIS

00:41:09.133 --> 00:41:11.001
BILL IS A SMALL BUT IMPORTANT

00:41:11.068 --> 00:41:14.104
STEP TOWARDS THAT. I'D LIKE TO

00:41:14.171 --> 00:41:16.440
SPEAK TO THE SECOND PART OF THIS

00:41:16.507 --> 00:41:18.375
BILL. JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO THE

00:41:18.442 --> 00:41:19.076
CALIFORNIA STATE CONTRACTORS

00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:20.444
LICENSING BOARD COMMISSIONED A

00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:22.847
STUDY BY THE UC BERKELEY LABOR

00:41:22.913 --> 00:41:25.516
CENTER. THAT PROVIDED A AN

00:41:25.583 --> 00:41:28.285
ARTICLE THAT THE QUOTES IT. THAT

00:41:28.352 --> 00:41:30.087
STUDY FOUND THAT THE AVERAGE

00:41:30.154 --> 00:41:32.056
SOLAR INSTALLER IN CALIFORNIA

00:41:32.122 --> 00:41:33.724
MAKES A MERE TWENTY THREE

00:41:33.791 --> 00:41:37.394
DOLLARS TOTAL PACKAGE. OKAY THE

00:41:37.461 --> 00:41:42.166
STUDY ALSO FOUND. EVIDENCE SHOWS

00:41:42.233 --> 00:41:43.634
THAT HIGHER WAGES DUE TO

00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:46.670
PREVAILING WAGE DO NOT SLOW

00:41:46.737 --> 00:41:49.173
SOLAR DEMAND WHY NOT INCLUDING

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.975
STATE THE FIRST LABOR COSTS

00:41:51.041 --> 00:41:52.977
DON'T INCREASE MUCH WITH HIGHER

00:41:53.043 --> 00:41:56.480
WAGES AND BENEFITS. INSTALLATION

00:41:56.547 --> 00:42:00.317
LABOR REPRESENTS 6211% OF TOTAL

00:42:00.384 --> 00:42:02.820
PROJECT COSTS SO EVEN LARGE

00:42:02.887 --> 00:42:03.554
INCREASES IN WORKERS

00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:05.856
COMPENSATION DON'T LEAD TO LARGE

00:42:05.923 --> 00:42:08.259
INCREASE IN TOTAL COSTS IN OTHER

00:42:08.325 --> 00:42:10.594
WORDS A 50% INCREASE IN LABOR

00:42:10.661 --> 00:42:13.530
COSTS WOULD INCREASE TOTAL COSTS

00:42:13.597 --> 00:42:16.000
BY ONLY THREE TO FIVE PERCENT.

00:42:16.066 --> 00:42:16.934
THE STUDY FOUND THAT IF YOU

00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:18.369
APPLIED PREVAILING WAGE THERE

00:42:18.435 --> 00:42:20.671
WOULD BE AN INITIAL UPFRONT COST

00:42:20.738 --> 00:42:22.172
INCREASE OF THREE TO FIVE

00:42:22.239 --> 00:42:24.608
PERCENT. BUT SECOND FRONT THE

00:42:24.675 --> 00:42:25.809
SECOND FINDING OF THE STUDY WAS

00:42:25.876 --> 00:42:28.412
THAT THE IMPROVEMENTS IN WORKER

00:42:28.479 --> 00:42:30.281
PRODUCTIVITY THAT COME WITH A

00:42:30.347 --> 00:42:32.449
SKILLED WORK FIRST TYPICALLY

00:42:32.516 --> 00:42:34.652
OFFSET THOSE WAGE INCREASES. AND

00:42:34.718 --> 00:42:36.120
THE LAST LINE I'LL READ YOU SAYS

00:42:36.186 --> 00:42:38.022
IF A SKILLED WORKER PROVIDES 50%

00:42:38.088 --> 00:42:39.657
MORE VALUE OF YOUR PROJECTED BE

00:42:39.723 --> 00:42:41.125
THAT UNSKILLED WORKER WHERE ONLY

00:42:41.191 --> 00:42:44.161
ONLY 25% MORE PAY HIGHER

00:42:44.228 --> 00:42:46.196
COMPENSATION IS A SOUND

00:42:46.263 --> 00:42:47.898
INVESTMENT. THIS BILL ONLY

01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:02.725
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- THIS IS

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:05.595
NOT AN IN INCREASED A DRIVER OF

01:01:05.661 --> 01:01:10.299
THOSE COSTS WE HAVE MANY OF. THE

01:01:10.366 --> 01:01:12.668
COMPANY'S LOCAL. THAT DO LARGE

01:01:12.735 --> 01:01:15.772
SCALE AG. AND I JUST DIDN'T HAVE

01:01:15.838 --> 01:01:17.573
NOT HAD TIME FRANKLY BECAUSE

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.542
THIS CAME TO ME QUICKLY.

01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:22.078
YESTERDAY AND I'M DOING MY

01:01:22.145 --> 01:01:25.948
HOMEWORK. AND LIKE I SAID A

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:27.250
LITTLE WAY OFF HERE TODAY. WE

01:01:27.316 --> 01:01:29.218
HAVE- QUESTIONS FROM SOME MEMBER

01:01:29.285 --> 01:01:31.754
SANTIAGO AND THEN- MISTER

01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:33.790
MURATSUCHI. FOLLOWED BY THIS

01:01:33.856 --> 01:01:39.729
HOLD. WHAT IF ANYONE ADDRESS

01:01:39.796 --> 01:01:41.431
MISTER WHAT IF I MAY MISTER

01:01:41.497 --> 01:01:43.266
CHAIR. AND WHEN ASKED HIM TO DO

01:01:43.332 --> 01:01:44.867
A LITTLE DEEPER MAYBE REPEAT

01:01:44.934 --> 01:01:46.836
SOME OF THE FINDINGS AND THAT UC

01:01:46.903 --> 01:01:48.704
BERKELEY STUDY- ON PREVAILING

01:01:48.771 --> 01:01:51.307
WAGE IF IN A AND I ALSO WANNA- I

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:52.175
DON'T KNOW IF I CAUGHT THIS

01:01:52.241 --> 01:01:53.976
EARLIER BUT WHO ALSO PAID FOR

01:01:54.043 --> 01:01:55.078
THAT STUDY BUT PRETTY GOOD

01:01:55.144 --> 01:01:56.079
DELIVER DEEPER OUT OF PUSHING

01:01:56.145 --> 01:01:57.814
THAT- THIS STUDY WAS

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:01.017
COMMISSIONED LAST YEAR BY THE

01:02:01.084 --> 01:02:01.918
STATE CONTRACTORS STATE

01:02:01.984 --> 01:02:02.785
LICENSING BOARD. AND THEY WENT

01:02:02.852 --> 01:02:05.221
OUT TO BID AND THEY SELECTED THE

01:02:05.288 --> 01:02:07.290
UC BERKELEY TO CONDUCT A STUDY.

01:02:07.356 --> 01:02:09.959
THEY FOUND THAT LABOR COSTS OF A

01:02:10.026 --> 01:02:11.327
PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL ROOFTOP

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:13.629
SOLAR PROJECTS REYES BETWEEN SIX

01:02:13.696 --> 01:02:18.734
AND 11% AND THAT IF- IF YOU

01:02:18.801 --> 01:02:22.238
ASSUME THAT UP IT PREVAILING

01:02:22.305 --> 01:02:26.008
WAGE WOULD ACCOUNT FOR A 50%

01:02:26.075 --> 01:02:28.411
INCREASE IN LABOR COSTS WHICH IT

01:02:28.478 --> 01:02:29.645
DOESN'T KNOW DEMONSTRATE THAT A

01:02:29.712 --> 01:02:31.180
MOMENT THAT THAT WOULD THEN

01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:33.649
RESULT IN A TOTAL INCREASE IN

01:02:33.716 --> 01:02:36.486
COST OF THREE TO FIVE PERCENT.

01:02:36.552 --> 01:02:38.521
OKAY THEY ALSO FOUND THAT THE

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:39.822
AVERAGE SOLAR INSTALLER IN

01:02:39.889 --> 01:02:42.492
CALIFORNIA MAKES A LITTLE OVER

01:02:42.558 --> 01:02:43.793
TWENTY THREE DOLLARS AN HOUR

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:46.129
WITHOUT BENEFITS I JUST GRABBED

01:02:46.195 --> 01:02:48.898
SACRAMENTO REALLY WAGE RATE OFF

01:02:48.965 --> 01:02:49.966
THE DEPARTMENT INDUSTRIAL

01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:50.967
RELATIONS NO THIS IS A

01:02:51.033 --> 01:02:53.336
RESIDENTIAL INSIDE WIREMAN RAPES

01:02:53.402 --> 01:02:56.472
OF REBUILDING A SOLAR ARRAY ON

01:02:56.539 --> 01:02:57.974
A- ON A ON A HOME. THE

01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.041
PREVAILING WAGE RATE

01:02:59.108 --> 01:03:00.576
SACRAMENTO'S THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS

01:03:00.643 --> 01:03:03.279
AND FIFTY CENTS AN HOUR FOR A

01:03:03.346 --> 01:03:04.614
FOR A FOR A RESIDENTIAL

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.316
ELECTRICIANS. RIGHT HERE. WITH

01:03:07.383 --> 01:03:09.118
AN ADDITIONAL SIXTEEN DOLLARS AN

01:03:09.185 --> 01:03:11.254
HOUR GOING TO HEALTH AND WELFARE

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:15.858
OF PENSION AND TRAINING- HOPE

01:03:15.925 --> 01:03:19.095
THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. THE

01:03:19.162 --> 01:03:20.530
COMPUTER THE OPPOSITION STATED A

01:03:20.596 --> 01:03:22.131
DIFFERENT NUMBER THAT WAS A

01:03:22.198 --> 01:03:23.799
LITTLE OUT OF LINE WITH WHAT

01:03:23.866 --> 01:03:25.635
I'VE HEARD YOU SAY NINE OUT I

01:03:25.701 --> 01:03:27.770
DON'T THINK YOU CAN ANSWER THEM

01:03:27.837 --> 01:03:29.038
BUT IT GIVE ANY THOUGHTS ON

01:03:29.105 --> 01:03:30.106
RECONCILING THE TWO DIFFERENT.

01:03:30.173 --> 01:03:33.609
NUMBERS YOU KNOW. IT IT VARIES

01:03:33.676 --> 01:03:36.379
WITH INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES- IF

01:03:36.445 --> 01:03:38.114
THE FIGURES THAT WERE SHARED BY

01:03:38.181 --> 01:03:39.815
A COUPLE OF THE PEOPLE WHO

01:03:39.882 --> 01:03:41.083
PHONED IN WERE ACCURATE THEN

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:42.351
THEY SHOULD HAVE ANY PROBLEM

01:03:42.418 --> 01:03:44.120
MEDIAN TO PREVENT A WAGE

01:03:44.187 --> 01:03:46.722
SCHEDULE IN IN IN THEIR AREA. I

01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:48.024
DON'T REALLY BUY THAT IT'S YOU

01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:50.159
KNOW UC BERKELEY DID A PRETTY

01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:51.194
THOROUGH STUDY AND WE KNOW WHAT

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:52.995
WE SEE OUT. IT IN IN THE

01:03:53.062 --> 01:03:54.864
LANDSCAPE. A. N. AGAIN THIS WAS

01:03:54.931 --> 01:03:56.899
NOT A STUDY DONE FOR THE I. B.

01:03:56.966 --> 01:03:59.068
W. THIS WAS AN INDEPENDENT STUDY

01:03:59.135 --> 01:04:00.203
PERFORMED FOR THE CONTRACTORS

01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:04.974
STATE LICENSING BOARD. A FOLLOW

01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:07.577
UP QUESTION SIR OKAY. WE WANT TO

01:04:07.643 --> 01:04:11.480
A MISTER MESSAGING. THANK THANK

01:04:11.547 --> 01:04:16.385
YOU- LET ME LET ME SAY FROM THE

01:04:16.452 --> 01:04:17.520
OUTSET I WANT TO MAKE IT

01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:25.962
ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT I. SUPPORT. A MIDDLE CLASS WAGE. FOR A

01:04:26.028 --> 01:04:29.031
ROOFTOP SOLAR INSTALLERS AND I

01:04:29.098 --> 01:04:32.468
SUPPORT A PREVAILING WAGE. FOR

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:35.838
PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS. BUT AT

01:04:35.905 --> 01:04:39.108
THE SAME TIME I THINK WE ALL

01:04:39.175 --> 01:04:42.645
AGREE THAT WE NEED MORE SOLAR.

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:45.948
ACROSS THE BOARD. ROUGH TOP

01:04:46.015 --> 01:04:48.784
UTILITY SCALE IN ORDER TO MEET

01:04:48.851 --> 01:04:49.919
OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND TO SAVE

01:04:49.986 --> 01:04:51.887
OUR PLANET. AND SO I THINK

01:04:51.954 --> 01:04:53.856
THAT'S THE DIFFICULT BALANCING

01:04:53.923 --> 01:04:58.594
ACT HERE- HOW DO WE. TAKE CARE

01:04:58.661 --> 01:05:01.297
OF OUR WORKERS WHILE AT THE SAME

01:05:01.364 --> 01:05:05.401
TIME- INCENTIVIZE MORE AND MORE

01:05:05.468 --> 01:05:07.837
SOLAR SO THAT WE CAN CUT DOWN

01:05:07.903 --> 01:05:11.474
ON. FOSSIL FUEL USE SO THAT WE

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:14.176
CAN. FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE AND

01:05:14.243 --> 01:05:18.314
SAVE OUR PLANET. I SHARE MISTER

01:05:18.381 --> 01:05:21.017
WATCHES GOAL OF. GETTING MORE

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:24.520
SOLAR ON EVERY ROOFTOP INCLUDING

01:05:24.587 --> 01:05:27.657
BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES- ONE

01:05:27.723 --> 01:05:30.359
OF MY CONCERNS IS THAT IF THIS

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:32.862
INCREASES COSTS ON SOLAR THAT IS

01:05:32.928 --> 01:05:36.499
GOING TO MAKE IT. MORE EXPENSIVE

01:05:36.565 --> 01:05:39.802
MORE DIFFICULT FOR. BLACK AND

01:05:39.869 --> 01:05:40.936
BROWN COMMUNITIES LOW INCOME

01:05:41.003 --> 01:05:42.972
COMMUNITIES TO GET SOLAR ON THE

01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:49.445
ROOFTOPS- AND SO I WANTED. TO

01:05:49.512 --> 01:05:51.480
MAKE THAT CLEAR AND SO LET ME

01:05:51.547 --> 01:05:53.549
JUMP INTO SOME OF MY SPECIFIC

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:55.651

COMPETITORS WHO PROVIDE- HIGHER

01:09:51.754 --> 01:09:54.156
COMPENSATION IT'S THE INTENT OF

01:09:54.223 --> 01:09:56.292
THE PREVAILING WAGE IS TO CREATE

01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:57.760
A LOT LEVEL PLAYING FIELD BY

01:09:57.826 --> 01:09:59.328
REQUIRING ACROSS THE BOARD RATE

TALKING HERE. YOU KNOW YOU

01:10:07.536 --> 01:10:11.874
MENTIONED- FIFTEEN KILOWATTS- OF

01:10:11.941 --> 01:10:14.743
A PROJECT IS SIXTY NINE PANELS I

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:16.278
HEARD I HEARD FROM. THE

01:10:16.345 --> 01:10:18.180
OPPOSITION THAT ITS IT'S-

01:10:18.247 --> 01:10:20.983
SOMETHING SMALLER BUT BE THAT AS

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:22.384
IT MAY IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:10:22.451 --> 01:10:27.289
YOU KNOW SOLAR PROJECTS ON THEIR

01:10:27.356 --> 01:10:29.491
OWN LARGE HOMES AS WE GET MORE

01:10:29.558 --> 01:10:30.159
HOMES COULD BE COMING

01:10:30.225 --> 01:10:32.595
ELECTRIFIED OR ON COMMERCIAL

01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:35.197
PROJECTS. YOU WANT US TO

01:10:35.264 --> 01:10:37.266
CONSIDER THESE TYPE OF PROJECTS

01:10:37.333 --> 01:10:39.234
TO BE PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS. YET

01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:41.570
MISS RESEARCH A SEVENTEEN TWENTY

01:10:41.637 --> 01:10:43.272
OF THE LABOR CODE DEFINES PUBLIC

01:10:43.339 --> 01:10:46.075
WORKS PROJECTS AS ANY PROJECT

01:10:46.141 --> 01:10:47.977
THAT RECEIVES THE ANY PROJECT

01:10:48.043 --> 01:10:50.279
WHERE THERE'S CAN DEMOLITION

01:10:50.346 --> 01:10:53.215
ALTERATION. OR CONSTRUCTION

01:10:53.282 --> 01:10:55.651
WHERE THEY'RE PAID FOR IN WHOLE

01:10:55.718 --> 01:10:59.088
OR IN PART THROUGH PUBLIC FUNDS

01:10:59.154 --> 01:11:00.055
AND THEN IT GOES ON TO DEFINE

01:11:00.122 --> 01:11:02.491
THOSE PUBLIC THOSE PUBLIC FUNDS

01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:04.660
IS ANY SORT OF SUBSIDY OF ANY

01:11:04.727 --> 01:11:06.128
SORT INCLUDING IF THEY IF THE

01:11:06.195 --> 01:11:08.864
CITY WAVES A DEVELOPER FEES OR

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:11.533
GIVES A GRANT OF ANY SIZE. IT IT

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.868
TRIGGERS THAT AND THEN THE

01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:15.471
LEGISLATURE HAS GONE IN AND

01:11:15.537 --> 01:11:17.940
DEEMED CERTAIN TYPES OF

01:11:18.007 --> 01:11:20.142
SUBSIDIES. TO TRIGGER PREVAILING

01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:22.011
WAGE AND WHAT THE ASSEMBLY

01:11:22.077 --> 01:11:24.246
MEMBERS BILL SUGGESTS HERE IS IF

01:11:24.313 --> 01:11:26.515
A LARGE SCALE ROOFTOP SOLAR

01:11:26.582 --> 01:11:29.551
PROJECT IS RECEIVING. SUBSIDIES

01:11:29.618 --> 01:11:30.619
OF WHICH THESE PROJECTS ARE

01:11:30.686 --> 01:11:32.421
RECEIVING MULTIPLE TYPES OF

01:11:32.488 --> 01:11:34.356
SUBSIDIES BUT IN THIS CASE ANNAM

01:11:34.423 --> 01:11:36.191
SUBSIDY. THAT THAT SHOULD

01:11:36.258 --> 01:11:39.662
TRIGGER PREVAILING WAGE OKAY SO

01:11:39.728 --> 01:11:41.730
FOLLOWING ON THAT POINT. IF

01:11:41.797 --> 01:11:43.432
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SUBSIDIES OF

01:11:43.499 --> 01:11:47.569
PUBLIC FUNDS. IT'S MY

01:11:47.636 --> 01:11:49.271
UNDERSTANDING THAT BE MA'AM

01:11:49.338 --> 01:11:53.375
TARIFF. IS NOT A PUBLIC FUND BUT

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:56.578
IT'S WHAT. THE AUTHOR OF THIS

01:11:56.645 --> 01:11:58.414
BILL AND OTHERS HAVE CALLED THE

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.549
COST SHIFT YOUR IN OTHER WORDS

01:12:00.616 --> 01:12:03.886
IT'S RATE PAYERS THAT PAY NOT

01:12:03.952 --> 01:12:05.988
PUBLIC FUNDS AND YOU'RE

01:12:06.055 --> 01:12:08.490
ABSOLUTELY 1100% CORRECT IT'S

01:12:08.557 --> 01:12:10.893
RATE PAYER MONIES. JUST LIKE THE

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:12.361
THREE INSTANCES THAT I OUTLINED

01:12:12.428 --> 01:12:14.029
WHERE THIS LEGISLATURE IN ITS

01:12:14.096 --> 01:12:16.231
WISDOM DECIDED TO SAY THAT

01:12:16.298 --> 01:12:18.033
RATEPAYER MONEY GOING FOR THAT

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.735
PURPOSE SHOULD BE PAID SHOULD

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:21.203
SHOULD BE COVERED BY PREVAILING

01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:24.773
WAGE TRANSMISSION IN AB EIGHT

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.975
FORTY ONE AND THEN OF COURSE THE

01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:28.077
FACT THAT ALL WORK DONE BY

01:12:28.143 --> 01:12:29.445
MUNICIPAL UTILITIES THAT SPEND

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:30.713
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS RATEPAYER

01:12:30.779 --> 01:12:31.313
MONEY ALSO TRIGGERS PROPERLY

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:40.489
WHICH- MY CONCERN IS THAT. WHILE. THIS PROJECT IS TALKING ABOUT

01:12:40.556 --> 01:12:41.924
. YOU KNOW ANYWHERE I UNDERSTAND

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:43.826
BETWEEN FORTY TWO TO SIXTY NINE

01:12:43.892 --> 01:12:45.894
PANELS IN ORDER TO GENERATE A

01:12:45.961 --> 01:12:49.565
LOAD OF FIFTEEN KILOWATTS- WHAT

01:12:49.631 --> 01:12:53.869
IS TO STOP. THE NEXT BILL TO GO

01:12:53.936 --> 01:12:57.306
AFTER ALL SOLAR PROJECTS TO BE

01:12:57.372 --> 01:12:58.674
CLASSIFIED AS PUBLIC WORKS

01:12:58.741 --> 01:13:03.779
PROJECTS. THAT CERTAINLY BE YOUR

01:13:03.846 --> 01:13:06.014
PER PROVOCATIVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:13:06.081 --> 01:13:08.450
. AND I THINK THAT IS. THE

01:13:08.517 --> 01:13:13.655
CONCERN I'D LIKE TO- ASK A AND

01:13:13.722 --> 01:13:18.060
THE OPPOSITION. WHAT IS THE

01:13:18.127 --> 01:13:23.565
TYPICAL- LOAD- SOLAR PROJECT- IT

01:13:23.632 --> 01:13:25.868
AND THE LOW TAT A SERVICE FOR

01:13:25.934 --> 01:13:28.537
YOUR YOUR YOUR TYPICAL HOME.

01:13:28.604 --> 01:13:30.372
THANK YOU THAT'S IT I'D BE HAPPY

01:13:30.439 --> 01:13:31.073
TO ANSWER THAT A TYPICAL

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:33.008
RESIDENTIAL INSTALLATION IN OUR

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:35.043
AREA IS ABOUT SEVEN TO TEN

01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:37.713
KILOWATTS- AND THE FIRE

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:39.047
DEPARTMENT THAT WE HELPED GO

01:13:39.114 --> 01:13:41.483
SOLAR WAS THREE FIRE HOUSES FOR

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:43.352
A TOTAL OF ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT

01:13:43.418 --> 01:13:46.421
KILOWATTS- TO HELP. CLARIFY

01:13:46.488 --> 01:13:49.458
WHAT- MISTER WHICH SAID EARLIER

01:13:49.525 --> 01:13:51.627
IT'S NOT KILOWATT HOURS THAT

01:13:51.693 --> 01:13:53.028
SOLAR PANELS PRODUCE ITS

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:55.030
KILOWATTS WHICH IS A MEASURE OF

01:13:55.097 --> 01:13:56.465
POWER WERE AS KILOWATT HOURS IS

01:13:56.532 --> 01:13:58.901
A MEASURE OF STORED ENERGY. SO

01:13:58.967 --> 01:14:01.904
A- SYSTEM THAT HAS SIXTY NINE

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:03.238
PANELS THE NUMBER OF PANELS

01:14:03.305 --> 01:14:04.840
ISN'T WHAT WHAT'S IMPORTANT IT'S

01:14:04.907 --> 01:14:07.042
THE NUMBER OF WATTS PER PANEL SO

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:09.011
ON A TYPICAL WATERS FOR PANELS

01:14:09.077 --> 01:14:11.446
NOW IS FOUR HUNDRED WATTS SO IF

01:14:11.513 --> 01:14:13.682
YOU HAVE TEN PANELS OF FOUR

01:14:13.749 --> 01:14:14.917
HUNDRED WATTS EACH THAT'S FOUR

01:14:14.983 --> 01:14:18.086
KILOWATTS. SO A SYSTEM OF FORTY

01:14:18.153 --> 01:14:20.789
KILL FORTY PANELS WOULD BE

01:14:20.856 --> 01:14:22.291
SIXTEEN KILOWATTS WHICH IS MORE

01:14:22.357 --> 01:14:23.659
THAN THE FIFTEEN KILOWATTS

01:14:23.725 --> 01:14:25.894
THAT'S PROPOSED IN THIS BILL. SO

01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:29.064
AND IF I MAY COULD I ALSO JUST

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:30.632
MENTION AS A SINGLE POINT OF

01:14:30.699 --> 01:14:33.669
REFERENCE IN. COMPARISON TO WHAT

01:14:33.735 --> 01:14:35.304
MR WHICH HAS SAID ABOUT

01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:38.807
PREVAILING WAGE I HAVE A BRAND

01:14:38.874 --> 01:14:41.043
NEW A HIGH SCHOOL GRDUATE FROM

01:14:41.109 --> 01:14:43.745
OAKLAND MICHAEL ESPINOZA. HE HAS

01:14:43.812 --> 01:14:46.248
NO SOUL OR EXPERIENCE I PAID HIM

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:48.817
TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR- AND

01:14:48.884 --> 01:14:51.119
WHEN WE DID THE FIRE DEPARTMENT

01:14:51.186 --> 01:14:53.689
PROJECT I HAD TO PAY HIM EIGHTY

01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:55.224
FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR FOR

01:14:55.290 --> 01:14:57.459
PREVAILING WAGE FOR AN INSIDE

01:14:57.526 --> 01:15:00.229
WIRE MEN WHICH SHE IS NOT- AND I

01:15:00.295 --> 01:15:02.831
WHAT. SHOULD BE IDEA OF EQUITY

01:15:02.898 --> 01:15:04.600
YOU'RE ADDING COSTS TO SOLAR IS

01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:05.734
NOT GOING TO HELP BLACK AND

01:15:05.801 --> 01:15:07.769
BROWN COMMUNITIES GOT MORE SOLAR

01:15:07.836 --> 01:15:11.139
SO THAT'S A FLAW AND SECONDLY.

01:15:11.206 --> 01:15:13.242
THE PREVAILING WAGE SYSTEM IS SO

01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:14.977
ANTIQUATED AND COMPLICATED I

01:15:15.043 --> 01:15:16.912
CAN'T BELIEVE ANYBODY CAN USE IT

01:15:16.979 --> 01:15:18.847
DO YOU KNOW WHEN I WENT TO GO

01:15:18.914 --> 01:15:21.016
LOOK UP WHAT DO I PAY MY GUYS I

01:15:21.083 --> 01:15:22.317
COULDN'T FIND SOLAR INSTALLER I

01:15:22.384 --> 01:15:24.219
COULD FIND HARD CARRIER DOES

01:15:24.286 --> 01:15:25.354
ANYONE KNOW WHAT HARD CARE YOUR

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:30.125
IS. IT SOMEONE WHO CARRIES

01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:30.993
BRICKS FOR A BRICK WHERE.

01:15:31.059 --> 01:15:32.728
THERE'S PROBABLY CANDLE MAKE AND

01:15:32.794 --> 01:15:34.029
BUGGY WHIP MAKERS IN THIS LIST

01:15:34.096 --> 01:15:36.265
BUT NOT SOLAR INSTALLERS SO. I

01:15:36.331 --> 01:15:38.834
JUST I THINK IT'S IN. IT'S IN

01:15:38.901 --> 01:15:42.404
NEED OF SOME RETOOLING TO BE

01:15:42.471 --> 01:15:44.106
HELPING US MODERNIZE OUR GRID

01:15:44.172 --> 01:15:46.275
AND I THINK I'VE ALREADY. MADE

01:15:46.341 --> 01:15:48.477
MY OTHER POINTS ABOUT HOW WE PAY

01:15:48.543 --> 01:15:49.511
A FAIR WAGE AND GIVE GOOD

01:15:49.578 --> 01:15:51.480
BENEFITS PAYING AT A HIGH SCHOOL

01:15:51.546 --> 01:15:53.448
GRADUATE EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS. IS

01:15:53.515 --> 01:15:55.250
NOT FAIR THANK YOU CAN YOU

01:15:55.317 --> 01:15:56.351
FOLLOW QUESTIONS MR MUCH

01:15:56.418 --> 01:15:59.488
REACHING UP IF I MAY YOU KNOW

01:15:59.554 --> 01:16:01.590
JUST. ONE OR TWO MORE QUESTIONS

01:16:01.657 --> 01:16:04.459
SO. IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS PROPOSAL

01:16:04.526 --> 01:16:07.195
IS FOR- REQUIRING PREVAILING

01:16:07.262 --> 01:16:10.465
WAGE ON ON THE INSTALLATION OF-

01:16:10.532 --> 01:16:13.669
ROOFTOP SOLAR- OVER FIFTEEN

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:16.271
KILOWATTS. SO IT SOUNDS LIKE ALL

01:16:16.338 --> 01:16:19.174
COMMERCIAL SO MY CHARITY MY WIFE

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:21.209
HOMELESS SERVICES CHARITY THAT

01:16:21.276 --> 01:16:22.477
WOULD HAVE REQUIRED IT MY

01:16:22.544 --> 01:16:24.279
DENTIST WOULD HAVE REQUIRED IT

01:16:24.346 --> 01:16:25.814
THE APARTMENT BUILDING IN A LOW

01:16:25.881 --> 01:16:26.949
INCOME NEIGHBORHOOD WOULD HAVE

01:16:27.015 --> 01:16:28.283
REQUIRED IT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT

01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:29.184
REQUIRED BECAUSE IT WAS A PUBLIC

01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:31.253
WORKS AND THEY HAD A PUBLIC

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:32.054
WORKS BUDGET. BUT THESE OTHER

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:33.388
CUSTOMERS OF MINE THEY DON'T

01:16:33.455 --> 01:16:36.591
OKAY SO I HEAR YOU THAT TO. IT

01:16:36.658 --> 01:16:39.161
SOUNDS LIKE. YOU KNOW COMMERCIAL

01:16:39.227 --> 01:16:41.663
OR PUBLIC OR BUILDINGS WITH

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:43.865
PUBLIC USE LIKE NONPROFITS MAY

01:16:43.932 --> 01:16:45.801
HAVE EASILY EXCEED FIFTEEN

01:16:45.867 --> 01:16:48.570
KILOWATTS. DEFINITELY OKAY BUT

01:16:48.637 --> 01:16:50.472
BUT YOUR TYPICAL THIS WOULD NOT.

01:16:50.539 --> 01:16:52.341
IMPACT YOUR TYPICAL HOME IT

01:16:52.407 --> 01:16:54.343
WOULD NOT IMPACT A TYPICAL

01:16:54.409 --> 01:16:56.378
RESIDENTIAL INSTALLATION IT

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:58.113
WOULD IMPACT SOME HIGHER END

01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:00.349
INSTALLATIONS. AND YOU KNOW YOU

01:17:00.415 --> 01:17:02.818
COULD MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT-

01:17:02.884 --> 01:17:04.453
THAT THAT'S FAIR BUT I COULD

01:17:04.519 --> 01:17:06.621
MAKE THE OPPOSING ARGUMENT THAT

01:17:06.688 --> 01:17:08.123
WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO GET

01:17:08.190 --> 01:17:09.992
PEOPLE TO PART WITH THEIR

01:17:10.058 --> 01:17:12.194
CAPITAL TO INVEST IN. EQUIPMENT

01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:13.762
TO MAKE ENERGY TO HELP US ALL GO

01:17:13.829 --> 01:17:15.697
SOLAR IT'S THE PEOPLE WITH THE

01:17:15.764 --> 01:17:17.132
MEANS THAT ARE GOING TO DO IT.

01:17:17.199 --> 01:17:19.501
SO IF WE WANT TO PUNISH THEM BY

01:17:19.568 --> 01:17:21.436
MAKING IT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN WE

01:17:21.503 --> 01:17:23.005
SHOULD YOU KNOW GO AHEAD AND

01:17:23.071 --> 01:17:25.574
REQUIRE PREVAILING WAGE FOR A

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:28.143
PRIVATE HOMEOWNER TO ADD SOLAR

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:30.479
TO HIS HOUSE. THANK YOU HAVE

01:17:30.545 --> 01:17:31.546
NOTHING THANK YOU HAVE QUESTIONS

01:17:31.613 --> 01:17:35.117
FROM. MISTER HOLD. THERE'S A LOT

01:17:35.183 --> 01:17:37.219
TO UNPACK IT ALL OF THAT I'M NOT

01:17:37.285 --> 01:17:39.254
SURE HOW MUCH I WANT TO DELVE

01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:41.690
INTO SOME OF THE POINTS HAVE

01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:44.393
BEEN MADE BUT I THINK THAT. I'LL

01:17:44.459 --> 01:17:46.695
JUST MAKE A- KIND OF A THIRTY

01:17:46.762 --> 01:17:47.896
THOUSAND FOOT OBSERVATION HERE

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:51.466
AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR.

01:17:51.533 --> 01:17:53.001
FOR COMING BACK AND TRYING TO

01:17:53.068 --> 01:17:54.870
ATTACK THIS ISSUE AND IT IS AN

01:17:54.936 --> 01:17:57.339
ISSUE. AND I THINK IT'S CLEAR

01:17:57.406 --> 01:17:59.474
AND I'LL GRANT YOU THE POINT

01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:01.043
THAT- THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS

01:18:01.109 --> 01:18:01.910
THAT PROBABLY NEED TO BE

01:18:01.977 --> 01:18:04.980
RETOOLED- GOOD- IF ONE WERE TO

01:18:05.047 --> 01:18:06.848
DIG INTO THEIR- THE CODES AND-

01:18:06.915 --> 01:18:08.183
ALL OF THAT YOU COULD PROBABLY

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:10.852
SEE SOME OTHER AREAS- NOT JUST

01:18:10.919 --> 01:18:13.555
AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT AT A

01:18:13.622 --> 01:18:15.490
LOCAL LEVEL. BUT AT THE END OF

01:18:15.557 --> 01:18:17.192
THE DAY THE THING THAT I'M-

01:18:17.259 --> 01:18:20.862
STOCK. HERE IN MY MIND. IS THAT

01:18:20.929 --> 01:18:22.564
THERE'S A PARADOX THAT'S

01:18:22.631 --> 01:18:27.335
EMERGING. ONE WHERE WE'RE SAYING

01:18:27.402 --> 01:18:28.804
WE'VE GOT TO GET OFF OF FOSSIL

01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:30.472
FUEL. AND WE ALL AGREE WE NEED

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:32.974
TO GET OFF OF FOSSIL FUEL. BUT

01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:34.409
IT'S ALSO INTERESTING THAT IS

01:18:34.476 --> 01:18:35.610
THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY THAT'S

01:18:35.677 --> 01:18:37.779
PAYING THE SAME WORKERS SIX

01:18:37.846 --> 01:18:41.783
FIGURES. IN INCOME A YEAR. AND

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:43.785
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT TRYING TO

01:18:43.852 --> 01:18:46.655
BRIDGE THAT GAP. THE AREA THAT

01:18:46.721 --> 01:18:48.557
WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THE

01:18:48.623 --> 01:18:50.826
TRANSITION TO THAT INDUSTRY.

01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:52.894
OBVIOUSLY IS NOT GOING TO BE

01:18:52.961 --> 01:18:54.463
PAYING SIX FIGURES. BECAUSE

01:18:54.529 --> 01:18:55.931
WE'RE STRUGGLING AT WHAT

01:18:55.997 --> 01:18:58.166
PREVAILING WAGE LOOKS LIKE. BUT

01:18:58.233 --> 01:19:00.001
IT IS A STEP IN THE DIRECTION

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:01.770
AND I'M NOT DIMINISHING SOME OF

01:19:01.837 --> 01:19:03.839
YOUR CONCERNS THAT YOU'VE

01:19:03.905 --> 01:19:07.309
RAISED. BUT IT IS NECESSARY TO

01:19:07.375 --> 01:19:10.345
TRY TO BRIDGE THE GAP. TERMS OF

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:12.881
WAGE AND WHAT THAT MEANS AND

01:19:12.948 --> 01:19:15.383
DATA IS IMPORTANT I APPRECIATE

01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:18.587
THE OF THE- STUDY THAT UC

01:19:18.653 --> 01:19:20.355
BERKELEY HAS DONE THAT'S BEEN

01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:21.490
PRESENTED TO US THAT'S

01:19:21.556 --> 01:19:23.458
INFORMATION TO HELP IN

01:19:23.525 --> 01:19:25.193
PROCESSING I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:26.061
THAT SAYS TO THE CONTRARY

01:19:26.128 --> 01:19:29.431
ALTHOUGH. I TAKE YOUR TESTIMONY

01:19:29.498 --> 01:19:31.833
TO BE VALID ON ITS FACE- BUT

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:34.002
THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS OF WHAT

01:19:34.069 --> 01:19:35.704
I THINK THIS BILL IS TRYING TO

01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:38.173
ACCOMPLISH NOW MICHAEL BILLS

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.408
THIS IS THE FIRST COMMITTEE. AND

01:19:40.475 --> 01:19:41.877
SO I'M ASSUMING AND I'M HOPING

01:19:41.943 --> 01:19:43.845
THAT CERTAINLY THE AUTHOR. AND

01:19:43.912 --> 01:19:46.414
THE SPONSOR WILL BE AMENABLE TO

01:19:46.481 --> 01:19:47.983
CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS I

01:19:48.049 --> 01:19:49.117
THINK THEY'VE ALREADY

01:19:49.184 --> 01:19:50.051
DEMONSTRATED THAT TO THE VICE

01:19:50.118 --> 01:19:51.653
CHAIR AS IT RELATES TO THE

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:54.256
IMPACT ON AGRICULTURE AND- WHAT.

01:19:54.322 --> 01:19:56.458
THAT ULTIMATELY MAY MEAN TO THE

01:19:56.525 --> 01:19:58.193
BUSINESS SECTOR IN HIS DISTRICT.

01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:00.061
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BUT

01:20:00.128 --> 01:20:00.929
THIS BILL IS TRYING TO

01:20:00.996 --> 01:20:02.430
COMPETITION THIS IS THE SAME

01:20:02.497 --> 01:20:05.066
LANGUAGE. THAT WAS IN YOUR BILL

01:20:05.133 --> 01:20:09.838
LAST YEAR AND- GONZALEZ IS BILL

01:20:09.905 --> 01:20:12.440
TO ADDRESS THIS. PROBLEM THAT WE

01:20:12.507 --> 01:20:14.009
HAVE WE'RE WE'RE STILL DEALING

01:20:14.075 --> 01:20:18.880
WITH TO SOME DEGREE- CAUTIOUS-

01:20:18.947 --> 01:20:21.883
WITH THE NUMBER- OF GRAHAM- THE

01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:24.286
REGULATORY AGENCY IS GOT A

01:20:24.352 --> 01:20:25.520
DECISION BEFORE IT WE'RE STILL

01:20:25.587 --> 01:20:27.722
TRYING TO. WAIT TO SEE WHAT THAT

01:20:27.789 --> 01:20:31.059
YIELDS- AND SO I'M PREPARED TO

01:20:31.126 --> 01:20:35.664
SUPPORT THE BILL I'M- OBVIOUSLY-

01:20:35.730 --> 01:20:37.866
HOPEFUL AND BELIEVING THAT. SOME

01:20:37.933 --> 01:20:39.834
OF THE IMPORTANT POINTS THAT

01:20:39.901 --> 01:20:41.636
HAVE COME OUT IN THIS

01:20:41.703 --> 01:20:43.071
CONVERSATION CAN BE PART OF

01:20:43.138 --> 01:20:45.307
FURTHER DISCUSSION. AND I

OF MERIT AS WELL AND SO. I'M

01:21:17.072 --> 01:21:19.574
PREPARED TO MOVE FORWARD. WITH

01:21:19.641 --> 01:21:21.776
THE BILL TODAY AND CONTINUE TO

01:21:21.843 --> 01:21:23.378
HOPE THAT THEY'LL BE

01:21:23.445 --> 01:21:25.480
CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN- OF THE

01:21:25.547 --> 01:21:27.716
PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS TO. SEE

01:21:27.782 --> 01:21:28.783
IF THERE'S SOME OTHER ELEMENTS

01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:32.187
OF. OF MODIFICATIONS THAT CAN BE

01:21:32.254 --> 01:21:33.588
LOOKED AT AS FAIR AND REASONABLE

01:21:33.655 --> 01:21:35.357

01:21:47.702 --> 01:21:49.671
QUICK WITH A QUICK CAR WITH THE

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:51.473
QUICK COMMENT I KNOW THE HOUR IS

01:21:51.539 --> 01:21:55.277
LATE AND- THIS IS THE AND I

01:21:55.343 --> 01:21:56.177
THOUGHT MY BUILD PRESENT TO

01:21:56.244 --> 01:21:58.246
SERVE. ON FIRST LET LET ME JUST

01:21:58.313 --> 01:21:59.881
TAKE OFF THE FOR BRING THIS BILL

01:21:59.948 --> 01:22:01.716
BACK ON THE LAST YEAR WE HAD A

01:22:01.783 --> 01:22:03.351
ROBUST DISCUSSION WITH. THIS%

01:22:03.418 --> 01:22:05.253
BECAUSE ALL HIS BILL AND AS

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:08.123
SOMEONE WHO IS A SOLAR CUSTOMER.

01:22:08.189 --> 01:22:10.725
A BIG FAN OF- THE NET ENERGY

01:22:10.792 --> 01:22:12.093
METERING SYSTEMATIC IT WAS

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:14.929
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO LAUNCH

01:22:14.996 --> 01:22:16.665
THE SOLAR INDUSTRY HERE ARE

01:22:16.731 --> 01:22:19.100
MILLION ROOF. GOAL WHICH WE DID

01:22:19.167 --> 01:22:22.037
HERE I BELIEVE FOR A YEAR TO GO.

01:22:22.103 --> 01:22:23.838
I THINK THAT THE VERY PROBLEM AT

01:22:23.905 --> 01:22:25.807
THE STATE HAVE HAVING SAID THAT.

01:22:25.874 --> 01:22:27.876
I THINK IT'S BEEN YEARS IN THE

01:22:27.942 --> 01:22:30.145
MAKING THAT WE NEED TO TAKE

01:22:30.211 --> 01:22:30.745
ANOTHER LOOK AT HOW WE DO NET

01:22:30.812 --> 01:22:32.947
ENERGY METERING. I SOMEONE WHO

01:22:33.014 --> 01:22:34.716
SAW BENEFITTED FROM THAT

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:37.886
PERSONALLY SINCE- TWO THOUSAND

01:22:37.952 --> 01:22:39.554
AND SEVEN WHEN I INSTALLED MY

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:41.656
OWN SOLAR INSTALLATION- I THINK

01:22:41.723 --> 01:22:46.494
IT IS TIME THAT WE TAKE ANOTHER

01:22:46.561 --> 01:22:47.062
LOOK. AT THE SYSTEM. I DON'T

01:22:47.128 --> 01:22:48.897
THINK THAT THE P. SEE OUT A

01:22:48.963 --> 01:22:51.766
RIGHT WHICH IS NOT A- BY THE

01:22:51.833 --> 01:22:53.001
THREE OF US TO BE ON THIS

01:22:53.068 --> 01:22:53.768
COMMITTEE FOR QUITE AWHILE. IT'S

01:22:53.835 --> 01:22:56.004
MUCH BETTER THAT WE TAKE A LOOK

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:57.038
AT IT FROM A LEGISLATIVE POINT

01:22:57.105 --> 01:22:59.307
OF VIEW. AND I KNOW THAT. THEIR

01:22:59.374 --> 01:23:00.375
LOT OF STRONG FEELINGS ON BOTH

01:23:00.442 --> 01:23:03.144
SIDES OF THIS ISSUE I REALLY

01:23:03.211 --> 01:23:03.845
WOULD URGE HOPE THE HOPE IS THAT

01:23:03.912 --> 01:23:05.080
WE CAN. YOU KNOW THE PARTIES CAN

01:23:05.146 --> 01:23:07.349
COME TOGETHER AND REACH A

01:23:07.415 --> 01:23:07.816
COMPROMISE AND I THINK

01:23:07.882 --> 01:23:09.617
UNFORTUNATELY WE WEREN'T ABLE TO

01:23:09.684 --> 01:23:10.785
REACH THAT. OUT LAST YEAR- BUT

01:23:10.852 --> 01:23:11.920
MY HOPE IS THIS YEAR THAT WE CAN

01:23:11.986 --> 01:23:13.855
REACH IT. AND THAT WE CAN FIND

01:23:13.922 --> 01:23:15.457
SOME. COMMON GROUND BETWEEN THE

01:23:15.523 --> 01:23:16.791
INDUSTRY AND I THINK BETWEEN ALL

01:23:16.858 --> 01:23:18.460
THE COMMUNITIES WHO. ARE

01:23:18.526 --> 01:23:20.462
CONCERNED ABOUT. THE ENERGY

01:23:20.528 --> 01:23:24.866
METERING SO. WHILE I'M- A HUGE.

01:23:24.933 --> 01:23:27.569
FAN PROPONENT OF. NOT RICHARD

01:23:27.635 --> 01:23:28.737

01:23:30.939 --> 01:23:32.607
POINT I'M- HAPPY TO AGAIN

01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:34.743
SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION LIKE I

01:23:34.809 --> 01:23:37.112
DID LAST YEAR. I THINK THAT THIS

01:23:37.178 --> 01:23:40.148
DISCUSSION TO BE HAD.

01:23:40.215 --> 01:23:41.082
COMPROMISED HIS BEHIND IT WE

01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:41.950

COMMITTEE I HOPE IS NOT LOST

01:23:54.095 --> 01:23:55.930
COMMITTEE I THINK THAT THIS

01:23:55.997 --> 01:23:57.198
DISCUSSION NEEDS TO BE HAD. AND

01:23:57.265 --> 01:23:59.334
I MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN COME

01:23:59.401 --> 01:24:00.902
TOGETHER. ON AN AGREEMENT TO

01:24:00.969 --> 01:24:01.736
REALLY REFORM POT NET ENERGY

01:24:01.803 --> 01:24:04.606
METERING WHICH I THINK AS LONG

01:24:04.672 --> 01:24:05.907
BEEN OVER TO. THANK YOU SOME OF

01:24:05.974 --> 01:24:08.209

IN GOOD SPIRITS- FOR THE PURPOSE

01:24:17.986 --> 01:24:20.155
OF ESTABLISHING SOME GOOD PUBLIC

01:24:20.221 --> 01:24:23.792
POLICY- THIS ISN'T THE LAST TIME

01:24:23.858 --> 01:24:26.027
WE HEAR THIS BILL AND THERE'S AN

01:24:26.094 --> 01:24:27.061
OPPORTUNITY I BELIEVE TO ADDRESS

01:24:27.128 --> 01:24:28.763
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE

01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:32.667
BEEN RAISED- BY THE- OPPOSITION

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:34.636

SO- BUT WE CAN'T WAIT FOR THEM

01:24:54.355 --> 01:24:55.757
ANYMORE. AND I THINK THAT'S WHY

01:24:55.824 --> 01:24:58.059

SOLUTION SO PREVAILING WAGE IS

01:26:33.655 --> 01:26:34.389
ALREADY SOMETHING THAT
