YOUR HEART I KNOW THAT YOU'RE

WORKING REALLY HARD TO TRY TO

00:20:15.948 --> 00:20:18.383
GET SOMETHING THAT. THE SILLY

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:19.484
RUMOR I'VE BEEN WORKING ON

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:20.519
SHE'S BEEN WORKING A DECADE I

00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:23.488
ONLY BEEN HERE NINE YEARS. AND

00:20:23.555 --> 00:20:24.056
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS AS

00:20:24.122 --> 00:20:25.857
WELL SO I WANTED JUST. A MINUTE

00:20:25.924 --> 00:20:26.725
I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THE

00:20:26.792 --> 00:20:28.427
BILL TODAY AND I WANT TO LAY

00:20:28.493 --> 00:20:30.462
OUT SOME REASONS WHY. I DON'T

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:33.765
BELIEVE. WE'RE GOING TO GET.

00:20:33.832 --> 00:20:36.234
WHERE WE WANT TO GO. IN I KNOW

00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:38.737
THAT WHEN THE SENATOR HAD HER

00:20:38.804 --> 00:20:39.338
BILL UP I TALKED ABOUT SOME OF

00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:42.741
THOSE. SAME SAME REASONS FIRST

00:20:42.808 --> 00:20:45.510
OFF I WANT TO SHARE. THAT

00:20:45.577 --> 00:20:47.112
ADDING MONEY TO THE POT ISN'T

00:20:47.179 --> 00:20:49.147
ALWAYS GONNA SOLVE THE PROBLEM

00:20:49.214 --> 00:20:50.282
AND I KNOW THAT THIS BILL IS

00:20:50.349 --> 00:20:52.384
GOING TO PUT A LOT OF RESOURCES

00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:54.453
IN BUT WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO

00:20:54.519 --> 00:20:58.190
DO IS WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT.

00:20:58.256 --> 00:21:00.559
CALIFORNIA IS A MAP OF WHO'S

00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:02.094
BEING SERED BY PRIVATE

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.295
COMPANIES AND WHO'S NOT BEING

00:21:03.362 --> 00:21:05.030
SERVED AND I KNOW THAT THE

00:21:05.097 --> 00:21:06.965
SENATOR COPULAR OWES BILL. WE

00:21:07.032 --> 00:21:08.266
TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THAT IN

00:21:08.333 --> 00:21:09.635
SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE

00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:13.205
HAVE ARE THAT. THE PRIVATE SIDE

00:21:13.271 --> 00:21:14.006
OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE GONNA SUPPORT

00:21:14.072 --> 00:21:16.174
OF AMENDED. BUT IN THE TIME

00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:19.478
I'VE BEEN HERE ONLY ONE COMPANY.

00:21:19.544 --> 00:21:21.546
HAS USED THE CAST OF FUNDS TO

00:21:21.613 --> 00:21:23.782
ACTUALLY EXTEND OUT. AND THAT

00:21:23.849 --> 00:21:25.183
WAS ONLY BECAUSE THEY WERE

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:28.420
FORCED TO IN AN ACQUISITION TO

00:21:28.487 --> 00:21:31.123
SUPPLY SERVICES. SO WHAT WE

00:21:31.189 --> 00:21:32.924
HAVE IS WE HAVE A CAR IN

00:21:32.991 --> 00:21:34.860
CALIFORNIA IS BROADBAND WITH NO

00:21:34.926 --> 00:21:36.495
WHEELS ON IT WE CAN'T GET WHERE

00:21:36.561 --> 00:21:38.664
WE WANT TO GO. BUT WE CONTINUE

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:40.666
TO PUT GAS IN IT AND ADD MORE

00:21:40.732 --> 00:21:42.701
GAS BUT IT'S NOT MOVING. WE

00:21:42.768 --> 00:21:45.037
HAVE SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. IN

00:21:45.103 --> 00:21:47.572
THE- BUDGET POTENTIAL SEVEN

00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:48.774
BILLION DOLLARS IT'S GOING TO

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.776
BE SUPPOSE THE USED.FOR THE

00:21:50.842 --> 00:21:53.445
MIDDLE MILE. SO THAT'S LIKE A

00:21:53.512 --> 00:21:55.280
FREEWAY WITH BILL ON RAMPS OR

00:21:55.347 --> 00:21:57.249
OFF RAMPS WE CAN'T GET WHERE WE

00:21:57.315 --> 00:22:00.018
WANT TO GO. SO FOR ME THE

00:22:00.085 --> 00:22:02.354
FRUSTRATION IS THAT WE NEED TO

00:22:02.421 --> 00:22:03.755
SIT DOWN AND WE NEED TO SAY TO

00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:05.457
THAT WHERE DO WE HAVE PLACES

00:22:05.524 --> 00:22:08.026
THAT WE DON'T. HAVE SERVICE AND

00:22:08.093 --> 00:22:10.562
I HAVE A LOT OF THOSE PLACES.

00:22:10.629 --> 00:22:11.096
AND WE NEED TO SAY TO THE

00:22:11.163 --> 00:22:13.365
PRIVATE UTILITY. YOU'RE GOING

00:22:13.432 --> 00:22:14.833
TO HELP US GET WHERE WE WANT TO

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.668
GO IN THIS CASE THEY WON'T TAKE

00:22:16.735 --> 00:22:18.537
THE CAST OF FUNDS. THEY DON'T

00:22:18.603 --> 00:22:21.039
USE. AND THE HISTORY WILL SHOW

00:22:21.106 --> 00:22:21.973
US THAT WE'RE GONNA SPEND THE

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.442
MONEY AGAIN. AND WE'RE NOT

00:22:23.508 --> 00:22:24.710
GOING TO GET. WHERE WE WANT TO

00:22:24.776 --> 00:22:31.116
GO. INTEL WE PUT THE UTILITIES.

00:22:31.183 --> 00:22:33.185
THAT'S COMCAST EIGHTEEN T.

00:22:33.251 --> 00:22:35.587
VERIZON ALL THOSE PEOPLE ALONG

00:22:35.654 --> 00:22:39.291
WITH THE REGULATOR WHICH IS THE

00:22:39.357 --> 00:22:39.825
P. U. C. PUBLIC UTILITIES

00:22:39.891 --> 00:22:42.194
COMMISSION. AND THE LEGISLATOR

IN A ROOM AND FIGURE OUT HOW

00:22:43.762 --> 00:22:44.596
WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY DELIVER

00:22:44.663 --> 00:22:46.798
THE SERVICES IN A COST

00:22:46.865 --> 00:22:47.999
EFFECTIVE WAY WE'RE GOING TO

00:22:48.066 --> 00:22:49.234
CONTINUE TO BE DOING THE SAME

00:22:49.301 --> 00:22:51.136
THING THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR

00:22:51.203 --> 00:22:53.004
THE LAST NINE YEARS WHICH IS

00:22:53.071 --> 00:22:54.740
PUTTING MONEY IN THE SYSTEM.

00:22:54.806 --> 00:22:56.541
AND NOT GETTING DELIVERABLES

00:22:56.608 --> 00:22:58.510
OUT THE OTHER END SO THIS IS

00:22:58.577 --> 00:23:01.012
THE THIS IS TO THE POOR BILLS

00:23:01.079 --> 00:23:04.449
NOW PUT TOGETHER. THERE WAS. A

00:23:04.516 --> 00:23:05.383

WE'VE GOT FOUR BILLS. TO THE

00:23:09.488 --> 00:23:11.523
LEGISLATURE TO RATHER SIMPLY

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:13.024
TWO OUT OF THE SENATE I WILL

00:23:13.091 --> 00:23:14.025
NOT BE SUPPORTING ANY OF THEM

00:23:14.092 --> 00:23:15.627
WE'RE GONNA BE UNTIL WE SIT

00:23:15.694 --> 00:23:17.028
DOWN AND ACTUALLY DO THE RIGHT

00:23:17.095 --> 00:23:20.065
THING WHICH IS. GET GOOD POLICY

00:23:20.132 --> 00:23:22.467
AND BASICALLY GET THE UTILITIES

00:23:22.534 --> 00:23:24.336
TO DO WHAT THEY SHOULD DO. NOW

DISTRICT. OF BROADBAND AND I

00:23:37.015 --> 00:23:39.017
CANNOT TAP INTO IT BECAUSE THEY

00:23:39.084 --> 00:23:42.587
CHOOSE NOT TO. BECAUSE THEY

00:23:42.654 --> 00:23:44.923
CAN'T MAKE ENOUGH MONEY THERE.

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:48.026
THESE CASTS OF FUNDS COULD HELP.

00:23:48.093 --> 00:23:50.462

LIBRARIES TO OUR BUSINESSES.

00:23:57.736 --> 00:23:58.970
BUT THEY CHOOSE NOT TO USE IT

00:23:59.037 --> 00:24:00.539
AND THAT GOES FOR ALL THE TEAMS

00:24:00.605 --> 00:24:01.673
I'M NOT JUST PICKING ON ONE

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.175
THEY ALL DO IT BECAUSE THEIR-

00:24:03.241 --> 00:24:06.478
PROFIT CENTERS. THIS BILLS THIS

00:24:06.545 --> 00:24:07.612
MONEY SHOULD BE HELPING US GET

THERE BUT IF THEY NEVER TAP

00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:10.482
INTO IT WE WON'T GET THERE.

00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:12.350
SOMEHOW WE HAVE TO FORCE THEM

00:24:12.417 --> 00:24:14.152
TO BE AT THE TABLE THE SAYS.

00:24:14.219 --> 00:24:15.554
WE'RE GOING TO GET THE SERVICES

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.422
WITHOUT HAVING TO BUILD. A

00:24:17.489 --> 00:24:19.891
COMPLETE NEW NETWORK. AROUND

00:24:19.958 --> 00:24:21.426
THEM TO GET THERE THE CALL

00:24:21.493 --> 00:24:23.195
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY. IN

00:24:23.261 --> 00:24:24.462
THE STATE TO EVER GET THERE SO

00:24:24.529 --> 00:24:26.231
FOR THOSE REASONS I WANT TO SAY

00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:27.332
AGAIN I RESPECT BOTH THE

00:24:27.399 --> 00:24:29.501
AUTHORS. I KNOW THEIR HEART I

00:24:29.568 --> 00:24:30.101
KNOW THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THE

00:24:30.168 --> 00:24:32.204
RIGHT THING. BUT THIS ISN'T

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:34.139
GONNA GET WHAT WE WANT. IN MY

00:24:34.206 --> 00:24:36.274
OPINION. THANK YOU MR CHAIR OUR

00:24:36.341 --> 00:24:44.516
BOARD JUST. SURE I'D LIKE TO I

COMMEND THE AUTHORS OFFER THE

00:24:47.652 --> 00:24:48.587
WORK THEY'RE DOING IN THE

00:24:48.653 --> 00:24:51.990
SPACE- I'VE DONE MY BEST TO TRY

00:24:52.057 --> 00:24:54.226
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH

00:24:54.292 --> 00:24:57.495
THE ABSENCE OF BROADBAND IN- MY

00:24:57.562 --> 00:24:59.931
DISTRICT REPRESENTING ALL OR

00:24:59.998 --> 00:25:01.766
PARTS OF ELEVEN COUNTIES

00:25:01.833 --> 00:25:03.235
NATIONALLY I'M GONNA HAVE A LOT

00:25:03.301 --> 00:25:04.769
OF RURAL FOOTHILL AND MOUNTAIN

00:25:04.836 --> 00:25:07.205
COMMUNITIES- THAT DO NOT HAVE

00:25:07.272 --> 00:25:09.107
SERVICE. I THINK WHAT I'VE

00:25:09.174 --> 00:25:12.510
LEARNED DURING THE PANDEMIC IS

00:25:12.577 --> 00:25:14.980
THAT AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT.

00:25:15.046 --> 00:25:16.014
WHAT WE DEEM TO BE ESSENTIAL

00:25:16.081 --> 00:25:18.149
SERVICES SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS

00:25:18.216 --> 00:25:21.353
SUPPLY CHAIN FOOD WATER. AND

00:25:21.419 --> 00:25:23.421
OTHER TYPES OF INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:25:23.488 --> 00:25:25.290
THE PANDEMIC TAUGHT US THAT

00:25:25.357 --> 00:25:26.725
BROADBAND SHOULD NOW BE

00:25:26.791 --> 00:25:29.194
CONSIDERED. PART OF OUR CENTRAL

00:25:29.261 --> 00:25:32.330
PORTFOLIO. IT IF THAT IS THE

00:25:32.397 --> 00:25:34.165
CASE AS CALIFORNIA DEEMS IT TO

00:25:34.232 --> 00:25:38.637
BE. WITH OUR SURPLUS OF LET'S

00:25:38.703 --> 00:25:40.605
SAY SEVENTY FIVE AND IT'S A BIT

00:25:40.672 --> 00:25:42.674
OF A MOVING TARGET STILL. THAT

00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:44.342
WE SHOULD BE MAKING MORE STATE

00:25:44.409 --> 00:25:46.611
INVESTMENT INTO THIS NINE OH

00:25:46.678 --> 00:25:47.512
SEVEN BILLION IS NOTHING TO

00:25:47.579 --> 00:25:50.515
SNEEZE AT. IF THAT'S THE NUMBER

00:25:50.582 --> 00:25:51.082
THAT IS MOVING FORWARD RIGHT

00:25:51.149 --> 00:25:54.519
NOW. HI I APPLAUD THE

00:25:54.586 --> 00:25:56.021
INVESTMENT IN THE MIDDLE MILE

00:25:56.087 --> 00:25:57.689
IN OTHER IN- IN OUR

00:25:57.756 --> 00:25:59.391
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS BUT

00:25:59.457 --> 00:26:01.960
THAT FINAL MILE. NEEDS TO BE

00:26:02.027 --> 00:26:03.762
PART OF THE EQUATION.

00:26:03.828 --> 00:26:05.297
ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE THESE

00:26:05.363 --> 00:26:06.631
RURAL AREAS I KNOW THAT THE

00:26:06.698 --> 00:26:08.099
AUTHOR REPRESENTS A NUMBER OF

00:26:08.166 --> 00:26:12.103
THEM HERSELF- I DON'T BELIEVE

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.572
WE NEED TO HAVE A SURCHARGE TO

00:26:14.639 --> 00:26:16.274
BE ABLE TO PUT SOMETHING LIKE

00:26:16.341 --> 00:26:17.842
THIS FORWARD THERE SHOULD BE A

00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:18.743
PRIORITY FOR THE STATE OF

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:20.278
CALIFORNIA WE SHOULD BE USING

00:26:20.345 --> 00:26:22.580
GENERAL FUND MONEY TO MAKE THIS

00:26:22.647 --> 00:26:24.783
INVESTMENT NOW THERE'S A COUPLE

00:26:24.849 --> 00:26:26.017
OF VARIATIONS THAT COULD TAKE

00:26:26.084 --> 00:26:27.953
PLACE WITH A SURCHARGE WHETHER

00:26:28.019 --> 00:26:30.188
IT BE A STATE GUARANTEE OR THE

00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:32.290
SURCHARGE IS SATISFIED BY THE

00:26:32.357 --> 00:26:35.493
STATE COMMITMENTS- IN MAYBE

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:36.761
DOWN THE ROAD MAINTENANCE COULD

00:26:36.828 --> 00:26:39.164
BE- BORNE BY THOSE ACCOUNT

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:42.300
HOLDERS. BUT I THINK THIS IS A

00:26:42.367 --> 00:26:43.568
STRONG STEP IN THE RIGHT

00:26:43.635 --> 00:26:45.103
DIRECTION BUT THE FUNDING

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:47.772
MECHANISM I THINK IS MISPLACED

00:26:47.839 --> 00:26:49.474
GIVEN HOW WE HAVE STATED BOTH

00:26:49.541 --> 00:26:51.076
AT THE EXECUTIVE LEVEL AS WELL

00:26:51.142 --> 00:26:53.011
AS LEGISLATIVE LEVEL THAT IF

00:26:53.078 --> 00:26:53.979
THIS IS WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE

00:26:54.045 --> 00:26:55.914
THE CENTRAL SERVICE WE NEED TO

00:26:55.981 --> 00:26:57.148
PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH

00:26:57.215 --> 00:26:58.950
IS THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS A

00:26:59.017 --> 00:27:00.785
GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT AND I

00:27:00.852 --> 00:27:02.854
KNOW THERE ARE POLITICAL

00:27:02.921 --> 00:27:03.822
CURRENTS AND CROSS CURRENTS

00:27:03.888 --> 00:27:06.758
THAT MAY- DISCOURAGE THAT TYPE

00:27:06.825 --> 00:27:07.993
OF SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL

00:27:08.059 --> 00:27:10.462
INVESTMENT BUT THAT WOULD BE

00:27:10.528 --> 00:27:13.298
THE RIGHT THING TO DO. VERY

00:27:13.365 --> 00:27:17.302
WELL- I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY

00:27:17.369 --> 00:27:21.239
THAT WE DO HAVE- GOING EXCEPT

00:27:21.306 --> 00:27:23.641
CENTER GONZALEZ MOTION NOW ON

00:27:23.708 --> 00:27:24.743
THE BILL THAT INCLUDES

00:27:24.809 --> 00:27:27.145
AMENDMENTS AND I BELIEVE THAT

00:27:27.212 --> 00:27:28.980
IN THAT MOTION IS TO PASS AS

00:27:29.047 --> 00:27:30.915
MINISTER FOR CEMENT AND RE

00:27:30.982 --> 00:27:32.217
REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON

00:27:32.283 --> 00:27:33.918
GOVERNMENT GOVERNANCE AND

00:27:33.985 --> 00:27:36.354
FINANCE. WILL BE SEEN ANOTHER

00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:38.390
COMMITTEE AND IN THE INTERIM I

00:27:38.456 --> 00:27:40.091
KNOW- THE AUTHORS EXPRESSED

00:27:40.158 --> 00:27:41.493
INTEREST TO CONTINUE WORKING

00:27:41.559 --> 00:27:42.994
WITH THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE AS

00:27:43.061 --> 00:27:44.329
WE KNOW WE ARE WORKING ON NOT

00:27:44.396 --> 00:27:46.297
ONLY SEVERAL BILLS BUT SOME

00:27:46.364 --> 00:27:47.198
BUDGET ITEMS THAT MAY PERTAIN

00:27:47.265 --> 00:27:49.334
TO THIS SO HOW WE STRUCTURE

00:27:49.401 --> 00:27:52.303
THESE INVESTMENTS MAY INCLUDE

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:52.937
SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE

00:27:53.004 --> 00:27:55.040
SHARED TODAY. IN TERMS OF THAT

00:27:55.106 --> 00:27:57.042
IN SOME STATE FUNDS INTO THIS

00:27:57.108 --> 00:27:58.710
INITIATIVE AND I THINK

00:27:58.777 --> 00:28:01.279
GENERALLY THEY SHOULD COVER THE

00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:03.214
CONNECTIONS FROM THE MIDDLE

00:28:03.281 --> 00:28:05.517
MILE TO OUR INDIVIDUAL

00:28:05.583 --> 00:28:07.485
COMMUNITIES AND THIS FUND

00:28:07.552 --> 00:28:09.387
COURSE I BELIEVE REALLY NEEDS A

00:28:09.454 --> 00:28:10.522
GIRL THAT THE MONEY HAS BEEN

00:28:10.588 --> 00:28:12.490
UTILIZED SUCCESSFULLY PASS AND

00:28:12.557 --> 00:28:14.259
ALL WE CAN DO IT ESPECIALLY

00:28:14.325 --> 00:28:15.527
WHEN WE HAVE A STRATEGY AND

00:28:15.593 --> 00:28:17.629
WE'RE WORKING ON IMPROVING ON

00:28:17.695 --> 00:28:19.564
THAT STRATEGY AS WE SPEAK. SO I

00:28:19.631 --> 00:28:23.101
WANT TO ASK THE- AUTHOR TO MAKE

00:28:23.168 --> 00:28:23.735
SOME CLOSING REMARKS FOR YOU IF

00:28:23.802 --> 00:28:27.639
YOU'D LIKE IF NOT WE HAVE RAGE ABOUT WELL THANK

00:28:27.705 --> 00:28:28.973
YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR I

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.708
APPRECIATE THE TIME AND I DO

00:28:30.775 --> 00:28:32.177
WANT TO CLARIFICATIONS FOR

00:28:32.243 --> 00:28:34.746
SENATOR DOLLY. AT FOURTEEN

00:28:34.813 --> 00:28:36.314
EXPANDS WHO CAN USE CAN THE

00:28:36.381 --> 00:28:37.415
CASTLE TO MAKE IT MORE

00:28:37.482 --> 00:28:39.350
ACCESSIBLE I AGREE WITH YOU

00:28:39.417 --> 00:28:42.087
THAT AT THE FIRST TIME WE DID

00:28:42.153 --> 00:28:42.687
SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE THERE WERE

00:28:42.754 --> 00:28:44.289
SOME BUMPS IN THE ROAD YOU KNOW

00:28:44.355 --> 00:28:45.523
IF WE COULD DO PERFECT-

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:47.425
LEGISLATION EVERY SINGLE TIME I

00:28:47.492 --> 00:28:48.626
STOOD UP HERE THAT THE ONE

00:28:48.693 --> 00:28:50.695
THING BUT ONE OF MY GOALS IS TO

00:28:50.762 --> 00:28:53.364
MAKE SURE WE DO A VERY GOOD-

00:28:53.431 --> 00:28:58.403
FRAMEWORK AND. THE SENATOR AND

00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:59.003
I HAVE WORKED. FOR HOURS AND

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:01.072
DAYS AND HALF STAKEHOLDERS

00:29:01.139 --> 00:29:03.208
INVOLVED IS TRYING TO MAKE SURE

00:29:03.274 --> 00:29:04.042
THAT WE HAD A GOOD FRAMEWORK TO

00:29:04.109 --> 00:29:05.777
GO AHEAD. YOU KNOW I WANT TO

00:29:05.844 --> 00:29:07.112
JUST REMIND YOU THAT DOES

00:29:07.178 --> 00:29:09.080
BENEFIT THE RURAL AREAS. YOU

00:29:09.147 --> 00:29:10.381
KNOW IF YOU KNOW WHERE I WANT

00:29:10.448 --> 00:29:11.716
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SATISFY

00:29:11.783 --> 00:29:13.218
THOUGH BUT ALSO AS SENATOR

00:29:13.284 --> 00:29:14.819
GONZALES WILL TELL YOU. THAT

00:29:14.886 --> 00:29:16.521
HER URBAN AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE

00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:18.623
CONNECTIVITY. THE BILL PER

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:20.792
PRIORITIZES RURAL AREAS. OFF

00:29:20.859 --> 00:29:22.861
THE TERROR ONLY AT TEN ONE

00:29:22.927 --> 00:29:24.929
SERVICE THAT PROVIDES BROADBAND

00:29:24.996 --> 00:29:27.098
AND AREAS I. S. P.'S- TYPICALLY

00:29:27.165 --> 00:29:31.536
SERVE. MONEY FOR THEM WITH

00:29:31.603 --> 00:29:33.872
LITTLE RETURN. IN THE BILL

00:29:33.938 --> 00:29:36.007
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS GPAS TRIBAL

00:29:36.074 --> 00:29:37.842
GOVERNMENTS COOPS CAN ACCESS

00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:39.577
THE CAPS OF FUNDS TO BUILD

00:29:39.644 --> 00:29:41.813
BROADBAND I'M MAKING THIS LOCAL

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.148
REGIONAL APPROACH AS YOU KNOW

00:29:43.214 --> 00:29:44.682
IN YOUR DISCIPLINE THIS HAS ONE

00:29:44.749 --> 00:29:46.484
OF THE BEST SYSTEMS AND I

00:29:46.551 --> 00:29:47.485
REALLY THINK THAT WE SHOULD

00:29:47.552 --> 00:29:48.820
MIRROR WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN AND

00:29:48.887 --> 00:29:51.422
HOW THEY'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND

00:29:51.489 --> 00:29:52.023
WE WANT THEM TO CONTINUE TO BE

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:54.359
SUCCESSFUL. END USERS WILL FIND

00:29:54.425 --> 00:29:56.494
THE SURCHARGE RATE. TO DIG DEEP

00:29:56.561 --> 00:29:58.696
FREEZE. SO I DON'T WANT YOU TO

00:29:58.763 --> 00:30:00.331
THINK THAT THIS IS LIKE THE END

00:30:00.398 --> 00:30:02.066
OF THE WORLD IS THE MAX WE CAN

00:30:02.133 --> 00:30:04.035
COLLECT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:30:04.102 --> 00:30:05.403
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. IT WILL

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:09.641
BE USE VERY- STRATEGICALLY- IF

00:30:09.707 --> 00:30:10.875
YOU HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO

00:30:10.942 --> 00:30:11.910
LOOK AT THE GOVERNOR'S

00:30:11.976 --> 00:30:14.012
STRATEGIC PLAN FOR BROADBAND. I

00:30:14.078 --> 00:30:16.948
WOULD THINK- I THINK MY VEHICLE.

00:30:17.015 --> 00:30:19.050
AUTHOR MRS- GETS ALL THIS AND I

00:30:19.117 --> 00:30:20.718
CAN AGREE THAT A LOT OF THE

00:30:20.785 --> 00:30:22.720
STUFF IS IN THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN

00:30:22.787 --> 00:30:24.088
IS A LOT OF THE STUFF THAT'S IN

00:30:24.155 --> 00:30:26.090
OUR BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN

00:30:26.157 --> 00:30:27.759
FORWARD ON THAT AND WE HAVE

00:30:27.825 --> 00:30:29.060
SUGGESTIONS EVEN MAKE THAT

00:30:29.127 --> 00:30:31.696
BETTER. SO I CAN I KNOW YOUR

00:30:31.763 --> 00:30:34.032
CONCERN I KNOW THAT- WE'RE

DIGITAL DIVIDE AS MANIFESTED

00:32:19.804 --> 00:32:21.072
ITSELF THROUGHOUT OUR STATE

00:32:21.139 --> 00:32:23.241
THIS PAST YEAR. WHETHER IT IS

FORTH IN AB FORTY ONE OUR

00:32:36.087 --> 00:32:38.289

BRING ALIFORNIA'S DATA

00:32:40.658 --> 00:32:42.627
FIRST CENTURY. IT'S TAKING

00:32:42.694 --> 00:32:44.796
OFFICE COMMON SENSE EXPANSION

00:32:44.862 --> 00:32:46.564
OF BROADBAND ACCESS HAS BEEN A

00:32:46.631 --> 00:32:48.800
PRIORITY OF MINE. I'M EXCITED

00:32:48.866 --> 00:32:49.934
TO BE ABLE TO BRING THAT

00:32:50.001 --> 00:32:51.035
WORKING KNOWLEDGE TO THE TABLE

00:32:51.102 --> 00:32:52.537
AS WE COLLABORATE BY CAMERON

00:32:52.603 --> 00:32:54.939
LEE AND WITH THE ADMINISTRATION

00:32:55.006 --> 00:32:56.808
TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE.

00:32:56.874 --> 00:32:58.443
THE CONCEPT OF DIG ONCE IS NOT

00:32:58.509 --> 00:33:00.511
A NEW POLICY AREA FOR ME I'M

00:33:00.578 --> 00:33:01.746
BRINGING THIS PROPOSAL BEFORE

00:33:01.813 --> 00:33:03.514
MY COLLEAGUES AGAIN. BECAUSE%

00:33:03.581 --> 00:33:04.849
UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF OUR STATE

00:33:04.916 --> 00:33:06.351
AGENCIES DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE

00:33:06.417 --> 00:33:08.686
URGENCY WITH WHICH WE MUST ROLL

00:33:08.753 --> 00:33:10.655
OUT BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:33:10.722 --> 00:33:11.956
AS SIMPLY AS WE UPGRADE OUR

00:33:12.023 --> 00:33:12.990
STATE ROADWAYS WE NEED TO

00:33:13.057 --> 00:33:16.094
DETERMINE HOW. NOT IF BROADBAND

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.595
IS A PART OF THAT IMMINENT

00:33:17.662 --> 00:33:19.497
INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT. I

00:33:19.564 --> 00:33:20.698
CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER WAY

00:33:20.765 --> 00:33:23.534
THAN TO LAY CONDUIT- WHEN WE

00:33:23.601 --> 00:33:24.435
HAVE THE GROUND ALREADY OPENED

00:33:24.502 --> 00:33:26.137
UP. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:33:26.204 --> 00:33:27.505
SPENDING OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:33:27.572 --> 00:33:29.340
IN MIDDLE MILE DEPLOYMENT WHICH

00:33:29.407 --> 00:33:31.743
IS EXCITING. BUT THEN WE HAVE A

00:33:31.809 --> 00:33:33.044
FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO

00:33:33.111 --> 00:33:34.445
MAXIMIZE COST SAVINGS

00:33:34.512 --> 00:33:36.080
OPPORTUNITIES IS IT TOO MUCH TO

00:33:36.147 --> 00:33:37.448
ASK IF WE GET BROADBAND

00:33:37.515 --> 00:33:39.183
INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT. YEAH

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:41.319
AND PLANNED ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE

00:33:41.386 --> 00:33:44.222
UPGRADES IN SYNC. I'M ASKING

00:33:44.288 --> 00:33:45.757
FOR SOME SIMPLE PLANNING BY OUR

00:33:45.823 --> 00:33:47.392
STATE AGENCIES WHICH CAN REDUCE

00:33:47.458 --> 00:33:49.060
THE COST OF DEPLOYMENT BY UP

00:33:49.127 --> 00:33:50.495
290% ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL

00:33:50.561 --> 00:33:52.163
HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION.

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:53.531
SIMILARLY I THINK WE ALL KNOW

00:33:53.598 --> 00:33:54.665
THAT OUR CURRENT BROADBAND

00:33:54.732 --> 00:33:56.434
SERVICE MAPS ARE WOEFULLY

00:33:56.501 --> 00:33:58.569
LACKING IN DETAIL. THEY LEAVE

00:33:58.636 --> 00:33:59.971
PEOPLE DISCONNECTED AND

00:34:00.037 --> 00:34:01.439
FRUSTRATED BY CRUDELY MARKING

00:34:01.506 --> 00:34:03.841
BASS CENSUS BLOCKS SERVED. AND

00:34:03.908 --> 00:34:05.743
UNSERVED SOMETIMES BASED ON A

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:07.879
SINGLE HOUSEHOLD. I GREW

00:34:07.945 --> 00:34:09.180
INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED AS WE

00:34:09.247 --> 00:34:10.815
CONTINUE DISCUSSING ACCESS TO

00:34:10.882 --> 00:34:11.749
STATE GRANTS AND PUBLIC

00:34:11.816 --> 00:34:14.152
INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT BASED

00:34:14.218 --> 00:34:16.254
ON MAPS THAT ARE FLAT WRONG.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.156
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NEIGHBORHOOD

00:34:18.222 --> 00:34:19.657
GROUPS COOPERATIVES AND MANY

00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:21.626
OTHERS ARE EAGER TO GET ONLINE.

00:34:21.692 --> 00:34:23.194
THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS TO GIVE

00:34:23.261 --> 00:34:25.196
THEM AN ACCURATE MAP. THAT

00:34:25.263 --> 00:34:27.331
ACTUALLY CAPTURES THE PROBLEM

00:34:27.398 --> 00:34:27.899
IN THEIR COMMUNITY THEY ARE

00:34:27.965 --> 00:34:30.034
WORKING TO SOLVE. I'M CONFIDENT

00:34:30.101 --> 00:34:31.803
THE C. P. C. C. P. U. C. HAS

00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:33.371
THE DATA WE SIMPLY NEED TO

00:34:33.438 --> 00:34:35.072
PRESENT. IT IN A WAY THAT GIVES

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:36.674
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE POWER TO

00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:39.510
USE IT EFFECTIVELY LIKE MANY

00:34:39.577 --> 00:34:40.578
OTHER STATES HAVE ALREADY DONE.

00:34:40.645 --> 00:34:41.746
WE WORKED WITH COMMITTEE STAFF

00:34:41.813 --> 00:34:42.814
TO TAKE AMENDMENTS THAT I

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.515

00:34:44.582 --> 00:34:46.083

INVESTING IN A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:52:57.574 --> 00:52:58.675
DON'T LIKE TO ADMIT THAT WE AS

HUMANS MAKE TRASH IN OUR-

00:53:00.677 --> 00:53:02.445
ENVIRONMENT AND ON OUR WAYS OF

00:53:02.512 --> 00:53:04.814
