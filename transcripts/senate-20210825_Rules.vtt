00:22:19.771 --> 00:22:20.739
SERVED OUT LONG IF YOU DON'T

00:22:20.806 --> 00:22:22.908
HAVE. A SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT

00:22:22.974 --> 00:22:24.843
AND PASSION ABOUT IT THERE HAVE

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.845
BEEN PROBLEMS ON MY GOOD

00:22:26.912 --> 00:22:28.480
COLLEAGUE ON MENTIONED THOSE

00:22:28.547 --> 00:22:30.182
REGARDING THE CONCERNS THAT

00:22:30.248 --> 00:22:33.719
HAVE ON COVERED IN NEWS

00:22:33.785 --> 00:22:35.520
ARTICLES ACTUALLY REGARDING ON

00:22:35.587 --> 00:22:36.822
THE TRANSFER OF MANSFIELD

00:22:36.888 --> 00:22:38.757
FEMALE INSTITUTIONS AND HOW

00:22:38.824 --> 00:22:40.892
THAT IS GOING AND I GUESS MY

00:22:40.959 --> 00:22:42.294
FIRST QUESTION A MAYBE ON MY

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.762
ONLY QUESTION ON THE F. WOULD

00:22:43.829 --> 00:22:46.231
BE ON COULD WE AVOID SOME OF

00:22:46.298 --> 00:22:48.166
THE OF INFORMATION WHETHER IT'S

00:22:48.233 --> 00:22:49.901
ACCURATE OR INACCURATE BY

00:22:49.968 --> 00:22:52.003
ENSURING THAT THOSE WHO ARE

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:55.574
TRANSFERRED OF FOR THE NEED- TO

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.442
BE HAVE THE TRANSFORMATION

00:22:57.509 --> 00:23:02.013
SURGERY BE HELD IN A SEPARATE

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.849
AREA SO WE DIDN'T HAVE CONCERNS

00:23:03.915 --> 00:23:06.485
THAT ARE ACTUAL OR PERHAPS- NOT

00:23:06.551 --> 00:23:09.121
SO ACCURATE THAT FOMENTED BY

00:23:09.187 --> 00:23:10.956
FROM WOULD APPEAR TO BE FROM

00:23:11.022 --> 00:23:13.625
PREVIOUS- YOU KNOW INFORMATION

00:23:13.692 --> 00:23:16.128
PERHAPS FROM STAFF- TO HEIGHTEN

00:23:16.194 --> 00:23:17.863
FEAR ABOUT IT AMONGST THE WOMEN

00:23:17.929 --> 00:23:20.766
POPULATION. SO MY QUESTION IS

00:23:20.832 --> 00:23:21.900
LAW IT SHOULD BE B. AND

00:23:21.967 --> 00:23:24.536
SEPARATE. OF FACILITY UNTIL WE

00:23:24.603 --> 00:23:25.804
ACTUALLY GO THROUGH THE

00:23:25.871 --> 00:23:29.975
TRANSFORMATION SURGERY OTHER

00:23:30.041 --> 00:23:31.476
ANY CONSIDERATION TO DO THAT

00:23:31.543 --> 00:23:34.946
ALL TAKE UP FOR A SHOT AT THIS

00:23:35.013 --> 00:23:37.482
ONE. SO WE EVALUATE HOUSING FOR

00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:38.884
ALL OF OUR INCARCERATED

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.186
POPULATION AND EVENTUALLY AND

00:23:41.253 --> 00:23:43.021
CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS ARE MOST

00:23:43.088 --> 00:23:45.524
APPROPRIATE- FOR SOME HOUSING

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:46.691
AND THAT COULD BE SINGLE SO

00:23:46.758 --> 00:23:49.261
WE'RE DOUBLE SALT- OTHER OF OUR

00:23:49.327 --> 00:23:51.329
FACILITIES- IT SUCH A CENTRAL

00:23:51.396 --> 00:23:53.298
CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY HAS

00:23:53.365 --> 00:23:56.468
ROOMS THAT HOLD- YOU KNOW FOUR

00:23:56.535 --> 00:23:58.203
TO SIX INDIVIDUALS AND WE WERE

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.839
VIEW OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ON A

00:24:00.906 --> 00:24:02.574
CASE BY CASE BASIS BASED ON

00:24:02.641 --> 00:24:04.643
THEIR INDIVIDUAL CASE FACTORS

00:24:04.709 --> 00:24:06.278
IN THE CASE FACTORS OF THOSE-

00:24:06.344 --> 00:24:07.412
INDIVIDUALS THEY MIGHT BE

00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:09.714
LIVING WEST SO WE DO A CASE BY

00:24:09.781 --> 00:24:11.883
CASE ANALYSIS ON THAT- AND

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:13.385
WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING AT.

00:24:13.451 --> 00:24:15.921
OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THAT

00:24:15.987 --> 00:24:19.591
PROCESS CAN YOU AT THIS POINT

00:24:19.658 --> 00:24:21.493
IN TIME IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.662
WORK IN PROGRESS I WOULD SAY

00:24:23.728 --> 00:24:25.797
THAT WOULD BE ACT YES BECAUSE I

00:24:25.864 --> 00:24:27.098
THINK FOR THOSE OF US ON THE

00:24:27.165 --> 00:24:29.434
OUTSIDE LOOKING OUT WHAT SEEM

00:24:29.501 --> 00:24:32.771
TO BE A VERY GOOD. PROGRAM

00:24:32.838 --> 00:24:34.506
GIVEN UPDATE THE ISSUES THAT

00:24:34.573 --> 00:24:36.641
HAD ARISEN AMOUNT OF SEVERAL OF

00:24:36.708 --> 00:24:37.843
THE INMATES I THINK THEY'RE

00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:39.244
WHAT TO ENTER SIXTY ONE WHO

00:24:39.311 --> 00:24:41.680
REQUESTED. OF THEM WHO ARE

00:24:41.746 --> 00:24:43.248
TRANSGENDER AND REQUESTED TO BE

00:24:43.315 --> 00:24:45.150
MOVED AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT.

00:24:45.217 --> 00:24:47.485
SORT OF PROBLEMS THEY WERE YOU

00:24:47.552 --> 00:24:49.688
KNOW FACING BEING- CONSIDERING

00:24:49.754 --> 00:24:51.523
THEMSELVES FEMALE AND BEING IN

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.225
THE MAIL INSTITUTIONS THAT

00:24:53.291 --> 00:24:55.360
WOULD BE N FARRAND OF- AS

00:24:55.427 --> 00:24:57.863
WE'RE HEARING REPORTS WITH-

00:24:57.929 --> 00:25:00.599
MAN. COMING INTO THE WOMEN WHO

00:25:00.665 --> 00:25:02.500

00:25:02.567 --> 00:25:03.635
COMING INTO THE WOMEN'S

00:25:03.702 --> 00:25:05.804
INSTITUTIONS AND BEING IN THE

YOU KNOW THE SHOWERS TOGETHER

00:25:07.606 --> 00:25:10.041
AND ALL OF THAT SO- IT WILL BE

00:25:10.108 --> 00:25:11.676
IMPORTANT I THINK GOING FORWARD

00:25:11.743 --> 00:25:13.912
THAT THAT IS ADDRESSED YEAH AND

00:25:13.979 --> 00:25:15.714
IT'S ADDRESSED VERY UP FRONT.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:16.848
SO THAT WE AREN'T IN THE

00:25:16.915 --> 00:25:18.950
POSITION OF LEGISLATORS TO

00:25:19.017 --> 00:25:21.419

00:25:21.486 --> 00:25:22.888
BE ACCURATE OR INACCURATE

00:25:22.954 --> 00:25:24.623
INFORMATION- BECAUSE I THINK

00:25:24.689 --> 00:25:26.758
OUR JOB ESPECIALLY WITH OF

00:25:26.825 --> 00:25:28.460
CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION

00:25:28.526 --> 00:25:29.961
IS TO ENSURE THAT RESTORATIVE

00:25:30.028 --> 00:25:31.496
JUSTICE THAT WE ARE ALL VERY

00:25:31.563 --> 00:25:33.498
STRONGLY BEHIND. IS WHAT IS

00:25:33.565 --> 00:25:34.366
REALLY HAPPENING IN OUR

00:25:34.432 --> 00:25:36.801
FACILITIES BOB YEAH I DID THAT

00:25:36.868 --> 00:25:39.237
IS THE UP COMMITMENT I THINK

00:25:39.304 --> 00:25:40.639
MOST OF US WHO ARE HERE AND

00:25:40.705 --> 00:25:42.173
HAVE BEEN HERE. COMING UP TO

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.142
THIS POINT IN TIME WANT THAT TO

00:25:44.209 --> 00:25:47.312
BE. THE MESSAGE- AMMUNITION IN

00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:53.084

PROGRAMS GOING ON- AND THAT WAS

00:26:00.992 --> 00:26:02.060
QUESTION NOW IS WHETHER WE'RE

00:26:02.127 --> 00:26:03.662
REALLY GETTING TO THE HEART OF

00:26:03.728 --> 00:26:05.096

ABLE TO A FAST. ANALYZE STUFF

00:26:29.521 --> 00:26:31.089
WHAT PARTICULAR AREA A

00:26:31.156 --> 00:26:33.058
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL WOULD BE

00:26:33.124 --> 00:26:34.326
BEST SUITED FOR I'M THINKING

00:26:34.392 --> 00:26:35.627
ABOUT THOSE WHO ARE IN BECAUSE

00:26:35.694 --> 00:26:38.029
OF SUBSTANCE COULD. I USE ABUSE

00:26:38.096 --> 00:26:39.931
AND WHAT PATH THAT PUT THEM ON

00:26:39.998 --> 00:26:41.700
UNFORTUNATELY OTHERS WHO MAY

00:26:41.766 --> 00:26:43.702
HAVE. YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT

00:26:43.768 --> 00:26:45.236

DON'T NEED TO HAVE A NURTURING

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.543
ENVIRONMENT. SO I EIGHT ONE

THAT PROVIDES THE EDUCATION

00:26:53.078 --> 00:26:54.479
THAT THEY DIDN'T RECEIVE SHOULD

00:26:54.546 --> 00:26:56.081
HAVE RECEIVED BUT CERTAINLY WE

00:26:56.147 --> 00:26:57.549
FAILED THEM ON THAT FRONT ALSO.

00:26:57.615 --> 00:26:58.650
WILLGIVE ME SOME THOUGHTS

00:26:58.717 --> 00:27:00.251

THE PUNISHMENT ON THAT NEITHER

OFTENTIMES WITH THE QUESTIONS

00:53:19.863 --> 00:53:23.400
THAT WE ASK- IN RULES ARE

IT'S YOU KNOW HOW TO FIND AND

00:53:29.339 --> 00:53:31.241
HOW TO GET ASSURANCES THAT

00:53:31.308 --> 00:53:32.742
FOLKS ARE THINKING ABOUT WAYS

00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:34.110
TO RUN AN INCREDIBLY

00:53:34.177 --> 00:53:37.681
COMPLICATED. AND LARGE SYSTEM

00:53:37.747 --> 00:53:39.716
AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE-

00:53:39.783 --> 00:53:42.752
INSERTING- HUMANITY AND DIGNITY

00:53:42.819 --> 00:53:44.054
AND BOTH HOUSING PERSUADED

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:45.322
FOLKS WHO TREATED BUT THEN ALSO

00:53:45.388 --> 00:53:46.456
HOW FOLKS ARE TREATED WHO ARE

00:53:46.523 --> 00:53:48.058
ACTUALLY GOING THERE EVERY DAY

00:53:48.124 --> 00:53:51.695

00:53:51.761 --> 00:53:54.331
QUESTIONS FOR BOTH OF YOU I'M

00:53:54.397 --> 00:53:55.732
GOING TO ASK THE QUESTION I

00:53:55.799 --> 00:53:56.666
THINK BOTH OF YOU ALL CAN

00:53:56.733 --> 00:53:58.668
ANSWER IT AND IT WOULD BE GREAT

00:53:58.735 --> 00:53:59.569
IF YOU COULD JUST ANSWER IT

00:53:59.636 --> 00:54:03.106
BASED ON. YOUR JURISDICTION-

00:54:03.173 --> 00:54:06.843
AND THE YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:08.645
AND I KNOW FOR MISTER MCCUMBER

00:54:08.712 --> 00:54:10.847
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING FROM ADMIN

00:54:10.914 --> 00:54:12.515
TO ADMINISTRATION YOU PROBABLY

00:54:12.582 --> 00:54:14.884
FROM ADMIN OPERATIONS YOU

00:54:14.951 --> 00:54:17.253
PROBABLY HAVE- ALL SORTS OF

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.989
PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU COULD

00:54:19.055 --> 00:54:21.958
SHARE BUT- I THINK YOU- IT'S

00:54:22.025 --> 00:54:23.994
LIKE YOU KNOW A AND B. MY FINAL

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:29.232
THING. I'M SO THE MISSION

00:54:29.299 --> 00:54:32.068
STATEMENT FOR CDC ARE WOULD YOU

00:54:32.135 --> 00:54:33.136
KIND OF NEVER REALLY READ THE

00:54:33.203 --> 00:54:36.206
MISSION STATEMENT- FOR THESE-

00:54:36.272 --> 00:54:38.942
DEPARTMENTS BUT I DID- AND I

00:54:39.009 --> 00:54:40.477
HAD TO COME BACK TO IT BECAUSE

00:54:40.543 --> 00:54:43.113
EACH OF YOU AND YOUR RESPONSES

00:54:43.179 --> 00:54:46.249
KIND OF TALKED ABOUT- HOW

00:54:46.316 --> 00:54:49.919
CULTURE CHANGE. IS HARD AND HOW

00:54:49.986 --> 00:54:51.655
THERE ARE SOME FOLKS THAT.

00:54:51.721 --> 00:54:54.357
REALLY DON'T BELIEVE IN

00:54:54.424 --> 00:54:56.493
REHABILITATION IN THE

00:54:56.559 --> 00:54:59.663
REHABILITATION AND CDCR YOU

00:54:59.729 --> 00:55:02.432
BOTH ALSO MENTIONED THAT- THERE

00:55:02.499 --> 00:55:04.200
ARE A LOT OF REALLY GOOD

00:55:04.267 --> 00:55:05.502
COMMITTED PEOPLE THAT ARE

00:55:05.568 --> 00:55:06.703
WORKING AND DOING THEIR BEST IN

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:09.673
THE SYSTEM. BUT OF COURSE THAT

00:55:09.739 --> 00:55:12.709
NUMBER IS NOT A 100% TO BE FAIR

00:55:12.776 --> 00:55:13.543
THAT NUMBER'S NOT A 100%

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:16.413
ANYWHERE- BUT JUST WANTED TO

00:55:16.479 --> 00:55:21.217
HEAR FROM YOU- BECAUSE I ALSO

00:55:21.284 --> 00:55:22.419
BELIEVE THAT TRAINING DOESN'T

00:55:22.485 --> 00:55:24.521
WORK WITHOUT BRIAN RIGHT

00:55:24.587 --> 00:55:26.523
WITHOUT MODELING- AND YOU BOTH

00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:28.858
DID TALK ABOUT TRAINING SO JUST

00:55:28.925 --> 00:55:30.326
WOULD LOVE TO HEAR YOUR

00:55:30.393 --> 00:55:32.562
THOUGHTS AGAIN ABOUT. YOU KNOW

00:55:32.629 --> 00:55:35.932
HOW HOW DOES THE MISSION CHANGE

00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:38.501
GET ACTIVATED- WHEN THERE ARE

00:55:38.568 --> 00:55:41.271
DISSENTERS- THAT ARE IN THEIR

00:55:41.337 --> 00:55:44.941
RANKS- THAT ARE ON THE GROUND.

00:55:45.008 --> 00:55:47.577
GIVEN THE REALLY COMPLICATED-

00:55:47.644 --> 00:55:49.112
AND DANGEROUS TASKS IN SOME

00:55:49.179 --> 00:55:52.082
INSTANCES THAT YOU ALL- ARE

00:55:52.148 --> 00:55:55.218
FORCED TO MANAGE- IT'S A SLOW

00:55:55.285 --> 00:55:57.721
PROCESS I'VE BEEN TOLD- I CAN

00:55:57.787 --> 00:55:59.389
BE A PAINFUL PROCESS I'M TOLD

00:55:59.456 --> 00:56:00.657
BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S STILL

00:56:00.724 --> 00:56:02.459
REALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT THE FEDS

00:56:02.525 --> 00:56:04.260
TELL US WE HAVE TO MAKE CHANGE.

00:56:04.327 --> 00:56:06.029
LEGISLATORS TELL YOU YOU HAVE

00:56:06.096 --> 00:56:07.697
TO MAKE CHANGE AND PROBABLY

00:56:07.764 --> 00:56:09.766
WITHIN YOUR OWN- YOU KNOW

00:56:09.833 --> 00:56:12.168
INTERNAL SESSIONS YOU KNOW

00:56:12.235 --> 00:56:13.169
ABOUT THE CHANGE YOU NEED TO

00:56:13.236 --> 00:56:15.305
SEE TO KEEP YOUR EMPLOYEES SAFE

00:56:15.371 --> 00:56:18.208
AND HAPPY- TO RETAIN THEM. TO

00:56:18.274 --> 00:56:19.976
RECRUIT NEW FOLKS INTO THE

00:56:20.043 --> 00:56:22.278
SYSTEM WE'RE GOING TO HELP TO

00:56:22.345 --> 00:56:24.614
MAKE THE SYSTEM ACTIVE AND

00:56:24.681 --> 00:56:27.550
ULTIMATELY- TO DO RIGHT BY WHAT

00:56:27.617 --> 00:56:29.152
THE CHARGES SO CAN YOU BOTH

00:56:29.219 --> 00:56:30.487
SORT OF TALK ABOUT IT FROM YOUR

00:56:30.553 --> 00:56:33.556
OWN PERSPECTIVE- HOW YOU.

00:56:33.623 --> 00:56:35.425
ACTIVATE THE MISSION GIVEN THE

00:56:35.492 --> 00:56:36.693
FACT THAT YOU DO HAVE FOLKS

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.262
THAT ARE NOT REALLY INTERESTED

00:56:39.329 --> 00:56:42.599
IN IT YOU CERTAINLY I CAN START

00:56:42.665 --> 00:56:45.101
THIS ONE- JEFF BUT- SENATOR

00:56:45.168 --> 00:56:46.302
YOU'RE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT

00:56:46.369 --> 00:56:49.038
EACH TIME WE MAKE A CHANGE EACH

00:56:49.105 --> 00:56:51.608
TIME THAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD-

00:56:51.674 --> 00:56:53.143
THERE ARE THERE ARE ALWAYS

00:56:53.209 --> 00:56:54.778
GOING TO BE SOME STAFF BETTER

00:56:54.844 --> 00:56:57.313
OR NOT ON ON BOARD. AND THERE

00:56:57.380 --> 00:56:58.548
WILL ALSO BE STAFF THAT ARE

00:56:58.615 --> 00:57:00.383
EARLY ADOPTERS AND WHO HELPED

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:02.452
US TO MAKE THE CHANGE HAPPEN

00:57:02.519 --> 00:57:04.821
RATHER SWIFTLY- WE SEE NOT IN

00:57:04.888 --> 00:57:06.122
OUR HISTORY WE SEEN THAT IN

00:57:06.189 --> 00:57:08.224
RECENT HISTORY. I MYSELF HAVE

00:57:08.291 --> 00:57:10.493
SEEN IT PERSONALLY- I WAS IN

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:12.529
THE APARTMENT I'VE BEEN HRE

00:57:12.595 --> 00:57:14.531
FOR SOME TIME. BUT WAS HERE

00:57:14.597 --> 00:57:16.666
WHEN WE MADE THE- SWITCH FROM

00:57:16.733 --> 00:57:20.003
CDC TWO CDC ARE. AND AT THAT

00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:22.138
TIME- THERE WERE STAFF THAT

00:57:22.205 --> 00:57:24.174
WERE ABSOLUTELY ON BOARD AND

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:26.309
EAGER TO SEE OUR TRANSFORMATION

00:57:26.376 --> 00:57:27.977
HAPPENED. AND THERE WERE SOME

00:57:28.044 --> 00:57:29.679
THAT WERE QUITE FRANKLY NOT ON

00:57:29.746 --> 00:57:32.715
BOARD- WE HAVE STAFF THAT HAVE

00:57:32.782 --> 00:57:35.985
BEEN WITH US FOR MANY YEARS- WE

00:57:36.052 --> 00:57:38.688
HAVE STAFF THAT SOMETIMES- HAVE

00:57:38.755 --> 00:57:40.490
DIFFICULTY WITH CHANGE. BUT

00:57:40.557 --> 00:57:41.858
WHAT I'VE FOUND IS THE MAJORITY

00:57:41.925 --> 00:57:43.860
OF OUR STAFF ARE EAGER FOR THE

00:57:43.927 --> 00:57:44.828

00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:58.041
THINK STAFF ARE REALLY

00:57:58.107 --> 00:57:59.709

SO HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU ENSURE

01:10:10.973 --> 01:10:12.007
THAT THEY'RE NOT TURNED OFF

01:10:12.074 --> 01:10:13.909
DURING KEY EXCHANGES I MEAN HOW

01:10:13.976 --> 01:10:18.280
DOES THAT WORK. D. YEAH BECAUSE

01:10:18.347 --> 01:10:20.783
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. THE

01:10:20.849 --> 01:10:22.818
REVIEWING THE FOOTAGE IS

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:25.754
COMPLAINT DRIVEN THAT'S CORRECT

01:10:25.821 --> 01:10:28.090
SO. LIKE I KNOW THAT I'M GOING

THE CAMERA OFF YOU KNOW SOUL

01:10:32.728 --> 01:10:34.129
SOUL THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION

01:10:34.196 --> 01:10:35.364
ONE STOP TURN THE CAMERA OFF

01:10:35.431 --> 01:10:36.432
THEY SHOULD BE STATING THE

01:10:36.498 --> 01:10:39.234
REASON WHY AND THE STAFF. AT

01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:40.302
THOSE FACILITIES THAT HAVE

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:41.937
IMPLEMENTED BY WARRING CAMPS OF

01:10:42.004 --> 01:10:44.340
ALL. RECEIVE TRAINING ON WHEN

01:10:44.406 --> 01:10:46.241
IT'S APPROPRIATE TO TURN A

01:10:46.308 --> 01:10:48.811
CAMERA OBVIOUSLY THINGS LIKE-

01:10:48.877 --> 01:10:51.880
USING A RESTROOM- WHILE THEY'RE

01:10:51.947 --> 01:10:52.615
DOING A HEALTH CARE

01:10:52.681 --> 01:10:54.717
APPOINTMENTS. S. KOREA HEALTH

01:10:54.783 --> 01:10:56.652
CARE APPOINTMENTS FOR A MEMBER

01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:59.154
OF THE INCARCERATED POPULATION-

01:10:59.221 --> 01:11:00.689
IF THEY'RE DOING AN UNCLE BODY

01:11:00.756 --> 01:11:02.691
SEARCH- OVER THE COURSE FOR

01:11:02.758 --> 01:11:05.060
INDIVIDUAL THAT THAT THAT WOULD

01:11:05.127 --> 01:11:07.730
BE A TIME WHEN YOU TURN IT OFF-

01:11:07.796 --> 01:11:08.297
IN THE CAR SHOULD POPULATION

01:11:08.364 --> 01:11:10.733
DOES- WHEN THOSE CAMERAS ARE ON

01:11:10.799 --> 01:11:14.403
A ROSTER THERE'S A LIGHT THAT

01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.970
SHOWS WHETHER IT'S ON OR NOT

01:11:15.037 --> 01:11:16.939
AND IT WOULD BE A RED FLAG

01:11:17.006 --> 01:11:18.941
CLEARLY IF THERE WAS AN

01:11:19.008 --> 01:11:21.510
INCIDENT. AND THE OFFICER DID

01:11:21.577 --> 01:11:23.812
NOT HAVE THEIR BODY WORN CAMERA

01:11:23.879 --> 01:11:25.981
ACTIVATED WHICH IS WHY I THINK

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:27.850
IT'S IMPORTANT. NOT ONLY WE

01:11:27.916 --> 01:11:28.984
HAVE THE BODY WORN CAMERAS WE

01:11:29.051 --> 01:11:31.553
HAVE THE SIX CAMERAS AS WELL.

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:32.988
AS HELP GIVE US THE FULL

01:11:33.055 --> 01:11:34.690
PICTURE OF WHAT'S GOING ON SO I

01:11:34.757 --> 01:11:37.693
THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:40.996
THANK YOU FOR THAT- I JUST HAVE

01:11:41.063 --> 01:11:42.498
ONE FINAL QUESTION AND I-

01:11:42.564 --> 01:11:45.100
MISTER ADAMANT AND DID WE WANT

01:11:45.167 --> 01:11:45.701
TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM MAKING

01:11:45.768 --> 01:11:48.637
BAD DECISIONS. YOU KNOW I THINK

01:11:48.704 --> 01:11:49.405
THAT BAD DECISIONS HAVE BEEN

01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:51.240
ALL THE TIME. IT'S JUST A PART

01:11:51.306 --> 01:11:53.609
OF LIFE- IT TO HOW WE LEARN

01:11:53.676 --> 01:11:55.878
FROM THEM IS THE THING WHICH I

01:11:55.944 --> 01:11:56.945
BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE

01:11:57.012 --> 01:11:58.781
ALSO SORT OF THAT SUGGESTING.

01:11:58.847 --> 01:12:00.115
SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE BAD

01:12:00.182 --> 01:12:01.650
DECISIONS THAT I'M INTERESTED

01:12:01.717 --> 01:12:02.918
IN IT SOME OF THE PREDATORY

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:04.553
DECISIONS AND THE REASON WHY I

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:06.321
STAY FOCUSED ON THIS ISSUE WAS

01:12:06.388 --> 01:12:09.224
BECAUSE- A FRIEND OF MINE- HIS

01:12:09.291 --> 01:12:11.160
SON. WAS A CORRECTIONAL

01:12:11.226 --> 01:12:15.998
OFFICER- AND- YOU KNOW IT'S

01:12:16.065 --> 01:12:17.966
DEEPER THAN HIM NOT FEELING

01:12:18.033 --> 01:12:19.001
SAFE BECAUSE HE'S NOT WITH US

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:21.303
ANYMORE- AND THAT'S THAT'S

01:12:21.370 --> 01:12:22.571
REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE

01:12:22.638 --> 01:12:24.740
HE WAS. A YOUNG MAN WITH A

01:12:24.807 --> 01:12:27.076
FAMILY AND A BRIGHT FUTURE- AND

01:12:27.142 --> 01:12:27.810
THEN I ALSO KNOW SOMEONE WHO IS

01:12:27.876 --> 01:12:29.978
INCARCERATED- WHO WAS RECENTLY

01:12:30.045 --> 01:12:31.447
SODOMIZED MULTIPLE TIMES JUST

01:12:31.513 --> 01:12:36.618
IN ONE DAY. AND SO WHILE HE IS-

01:12:36.685 --> 01:12:38.554
INCARCERATED BECAUSE OF A CRIME

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:40.489
HE COMMITTED- HE CERTAINLY

01:12:40.556 --> 01:12:41.690
DOESN'T NEED TO BE TREATED LIKE

01:12:41.757 --> 01:12:43.859
THAT AND SO I THINK ABOUT THOSE

01:12:43.926 --> 01:12:46.795
PEOPLE- WHEN I'M- BEFORE YOU OR

01:12:46.862 --> 01:12:48.630
ANYONE ELSE ASKING QUESTIONS AS

01:12:48.697 --> 01:12:50.833
IT RELATES TO CDCR MY LAST

01:12:50.899 --> 01:12:52.568
QUESTION IS REALLY FOR MISTER

01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:54.169

01:12:56.638 --> 01:13:00.075
CLOSURE OF DJJ I JUST WANTED TO

01:13:02.644 --> 01:13:07.116
THOUGHTS ON- HOW THAT IS GOING-

01:13:07.182 --> 01:13:10.552
AND ALSO HOW WE CAN BE PARTNERS

01:13:10.619 --> 01:13:14.189
WITH YOU AND CDCR AND MAKING

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:16.759
SURE THAT THIS HAPPENS- IN A

01:13:16.825 --> 01:13:18.594
WAY THAT IS PRODUCTIVE

01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:19.795
CONSTRUCTIVE AND ALTERNATELY

01:13:19.862 --> 01:13:22.164
SUCCESSFUL- BECAUSE IT'S A HUGE

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:23.832

BUT YOU KNOW PLANS ON PAPER ARE

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:31.507
VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT'S

01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:34.576
GOING ON IN THE REAL WORLD AND

01:13:34.643 --> 01:13:37.246

WHAT YOU'RE SEEING AND- AND HOW

01:13:45.053 --> 01:13:47.589
WE CAN BE PARTNERS WITH THIS OF

COURSE- WE ARE- ACTIVELY-

01:13:50.759 --> 01:13:53.128
WORKING WITH THE COUNTY'S AND

IMPLEMENT- SKEWS ME THIS

01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:08.944
TRANSITION WE ARE COMMITTED TO

DEADLINE FOR THAT IS JANUARY-

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:21.824

THAT FACILITY IS CLOSING SO

01:14:35.804 --> 01:14:37.940
THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION AND

01:14:38.006 --> 01:14:40.576

WANT TO FACE LAYOFFS THEY DON'T

01:14:56.625 --> 01:14:59.061
WANT TO BE AT- THE END OF THE

01:14:59.127 --> 01:15:00.395
LINE WHEN IT COMES TO FINDING A
