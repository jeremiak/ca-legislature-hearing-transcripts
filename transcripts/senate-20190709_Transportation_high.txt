P. CAN LIVE WITHIN ITS MEANS AND THE SAME TIME TRYING TO CHANNEL THAT REBATE MONEY TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO NEED THE REBATES THE MOST AND WHOSE DECISION TO BUY AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE WILL BE MOST AFFECTED BY GETTING THAT REBATE SO WE ACTUALLY THINK THE INCOME CAPS ARE COULD BE LOWERED FROM WHAT THEY ARE NOW AND THE A.

WOULD HAVE COST APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS -- FORTY FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS THAT -- THAT BRIDGE PROJECT WAS ULTIMATELY CANCERS TAKEN OFF OF -- THE LIST FOR FUNDING AND CAL CALTRANS IS NO LONGER PURSUING THAT AS A STATE FUNDED BRIDGE PROJECT NINE WOULD ALLOW THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DEVELOP A LOCAL PLAN -- TO PROVIDE A CROSSING OF THE FEATHER RIVER THAT WOULD HELP RELIEVE TRAFFIC CONGESTION IN THE REGION -- IT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO FILE AN ALTERNATIVE PROGRAM WITH THE CDC TO REMEDY -- THE TRANSPORTATION PROBLEMS IN THE AREA IN UNDER THIS PROCESS CTC WOULD MAINTAIN FINALISTS AUTHORITY OVER THE CONTENT AND APPROVAL OF THE LOCAL ALTERNATIVE PLAN IF APPROVED THE LOCAL BRIDGE PROJECT WOULD COST APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FORTY FIVE

THAT WE ARE GOING TO USE -- FORWARD SO AND ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OKAY IN SUPPORT TODAY IN A LANGLEY FROM -- THE THE CITY THE CITY YEAH WELCOME -- YOU HAVE THE FLOOR HI MY NAME'S DIANA LATELY AND I IN THE INTERIM CITY MANAGER FOR THE CITY OF YUBA CITY WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS BILL THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK FOR MANY YEARS ABOUT A THIRD BRIDGE WHEN CALTRANS DECIDED TO -- DETERMINE THAT THE RIGHT OF WAY WAS ACCESS RIGHT OF WAY WE LOOK AT THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP A LOCAL BRIDGE AND WORK WITH OUR REGIONAL PARTNERS TO DEVELOP THAT BRIDGE I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OKAY OTHERS SPEAKERS IN FAVOR PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CAROLING ABOUT THE VIEW BUT COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND STRONG SUPPORT TODAY THEY WORK VERY WELL WITH THE REGIONAL COUNTY PARTNERS THAT ON MANY A STATE PROJECTS IN THE ASKARI AYE BUT TODAY THANK YOU OKAY ARE WE HAVE SPEAKERS OPPOSING THE BILL PLEASE ANYBODY OPPOSING SEE NO QUESTIONS THE REQUESTED I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS I WANTED TO KNOW WHETHER ANY OTHER EXAMPLES WE'VE TAKEN OUT CALTRANS MONEY FROM THE SALE OF PROPERTY AND NOT PUT IN INTO THE STATE HIGHWAY ACCOUNT WE PUT IT INTO LOCAL COMMITTAL LOCAL JURISDICTION -- WORLD CENTER CABALLERO HAS A SIMILAR BILLS THAT I BELIEVE PASSES THIS COMMITTEE THAT DOES THE SAME THING WE'VE DONE IT IN PREVIOUS CASES WITH THOSE TYPES OF PROJECTS WHERE IT'S YOU KNOW KEEP THE SALE THAT STATE PROJECT THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY FOR A STATE PROJECT ALLOWING THE LOCALS TO HAVE THAT THAT FUNDING I HAD A BILL SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR -- THAT PASSED THIS COMMITTEE AND IN BOTH HOUSES IT WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR -- BECAUSE GOVERNOR BROWN KINDA HAD AN AVERSION TO TO DO IN THIS WANTED TO KEEP THE MONEY IN THE STATE FUNDS SOME MEMBER YOU HAVE ANOTHER BILL AB FOR THIRTY WHICH IS PASSED IS GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS WHICH GIVES A SICK WICKS EMPTION TO THE CITY OF YUBA CITY WHICH COINCIDENTALLY IS FORTY EIGHT MILES FROM PARADISE BUT GIVES THEM AT AT AT SEQUEL EXCEPTION FOR FIVE YEARS OR SIX YEARS SO MY QUESTION IS CAN MONEY BE USE FROM THIS PROJECT OR WILL MONEY BE USED THIS PROJECT TO DEVELOP THESE HUNDRED THIRTY ACRES THAT ARE IDENTIFIED

SUGGEST AMENDMENTS AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE WORK ON THIS ISSUE AB SEVEN OH IT CLOSES A LOOPHOLE THAT ALLOWS ONLINE TRAFFIC VIOLATORS SCHOOLS TO CREATE HUNDREDS OF SIMILAR NAME SCHOOLS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DOMINATING THE DMV REFERRAL LIST THEREBY INCREASING THE ODDS OF VIOLATORS PARTICIPATING IN THE STATE TVS PROGRAM WILL RANDOMLY SELECT ONE OF THEIR RIGID REGISTERED SCHOOL NAMES KERN STATUE ALLOWS MORE THAN ONE LICENSE SCHOOL TO BE CO LOCATED AT ONE PHYSICAL LOCATION THIS WAS WRITTEN ONE BRICK AND MORTAR SCHOOLS WERE THE PREDOMINANT MODEL AT THAT TIME ALLOW ME A SCHOOL ROOM TO BE SHARED BY MULTIPLE SCHOOL OPERATORS MADE PRACTICAL SENSE HOWEVER TODAY THERE ARE FEW BRICK AND MORTAR ESTABLISHMENTS AND THE INDUSTRY'S OVERWHELMINGLY DOMINATED BY ONLINE SCHOOLS AB SEVEN AWAY WILL REQUIRE EASE TRAFFIC VIOLATORS SCHOOL TO HAVE A HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT PLACE OF BUSINESS THAT IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC DURING NORMAL BUSINESS HOURS AS WELL AS AN OPERATOR WHO CAN PASS AN AUDIT IN ORDER TO CRACK DOWN ON THE PROLIFERATION OF ONLINE ONLINE TRAFFIC SCHOOLS FURTHER IN AN EFFORT TO PROVIDE CONSUMER PROTECTION FROM PROVIDING PERSONALIZED IDENTIFYING INFORMATION AB SEVEN AWAIT WOULD REQUIRE ALL TV SCHOOLS TO MEET NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS AND OBTAINING COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATES CATION FROM A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED ACCREDITING ACCREDITED ENTITY TODAY HAVE SCOTT WHAT'S YOUR TODAY IN SUPPORT AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU ARE ASSEMBLYMAN ANIMAL HERE FOR SPEAKERS IN FAVOR PLEASE MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOT WHICH ON BEHALF OF THE DISTANCE LEARNING COMPANY CURRENTLY IN NEW YORK YOU HAVE TWELVE APPROVED TRAFFIC VIOLATORS SCHOOLS IN TEXAS YOU HAVE FIFTY IN CALIFORNIA YOU HAVE OVER TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED EVERY MONTH YOU HAVE ANOTHER HUNDRED SCHOOLS BEING REGISTERED WHY BECAUSE IT NEARLY COSTS ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS TO FILE AN APPLICATION IT TAKES A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR BOND WHICH IS BASICALLY ABOUT FIFTY BUCKS A MONTH TO CARRY A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR BOND FOLKS PHOTO COPY OR DOWNLOAD BASICALLY THE DMV HANDBOOK PUT IT ON A WEBSITE AND THEN WILL JUST DUPLICATE THE WEBSITE THERE'S ONE COMPANY IN CALIFORNIA THAT OPERATES FOURTEEN HUNDRED ONLINE TRAFFIC SCHOOLS ALL THE WEBSITES LOOK IDENTICAL THEY ALL FEET INTO THE SAME PHONE NUMBER THIS IS BAD BECAUSE IT HURTS LEGITIMATE OPERATORS IT'S BAD BECAUSE IT PROVIDES ZERO TRANSPARENCY TO CONSUMERS THINK ABOUT THIS WE'VE HEARD CONSUMER COMPLAINTS FOR FOLKS HAVE TRIED TO GO TO THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU AND FILE COMPLAINTS BECAUSE THEY HAD THEIR CREDIT CARD DOUBLE AND TRIPLE CHARGED THEY NEVER GOT THEIR CERTIFICATE THEY FOUND THAT THE PROGRAM DIDN'T WORK THEY HAD ISSUES AND PROBLEMS BUT YET THEY CAN'T FIND EXACTLY WHO THE OPERATOR IS OR WANTS THERE'S ENOUGH COMPLAINTS FILED THAT DOMAIN NAME IS A RACIST BECAUSE THAT COMPANY HAS ANOTHER THIRTEEN HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE IT IS RENDERED THE DMV AUDIT PROCESS WHERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AUDITING THE SCHOOLS COMPLETELY -- USELESS SO THEY CEASE DOING AUDITS BECAUSE THEY JUST FIND THAT THEY RANDOMLY WILL JUST KEEP SELECTING THE SAME COMPANY THEY DO ONE SCHOOL LITERALLY OPERATES FOURTEEN HUNDRED DIFFERENT TRAFFIC SCHOOLS OUT OF ONE ADDRESS WITH DOZENS AND DOZENS AND DOZENS OF SERVERS PUBLIC INTEREST WHATSOEVER THE SECOND THING THAT THIS BILL DOES MISTER CHAIRMAN IS IT PROTECTS PERSONAL INFORMATION TRAFFIC SCHOOLS HAVE YOUR DRIVING RECORD YOUR YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE YOUR CREDIT CARD USES SECURITY NUMBER THEY ARE NOT REQUIRED TO FOLLOW THE SAME PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION STANDARDS THAT CONTRACTORS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO THIS BILL WOULD CORRECT THAT SO WE WOULD ORIGINAL VOTE WE DID HAND OUT A LIST OF THE CURRENT TRAFFIC SCHOOLS YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU HAVE TRAVELED SCHOOLS ARE LIKE ACNE TRAVEL SCHOOL NUMBER ONE THROUGH TWO HUNDRED AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT BY ONE MORE SPEAKER PLEASE WHEN MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GARY ALEXANDER INTERACTIVE EDUCATION CONCEPTS WERE LICENSED -- CALIFORNIA TRAFFIC SCHOOL BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN CALIFORNIA -- I JUST LIKE TO TESTIFY TO THE FACT OF HOW IT AFFECTS OUR BUSINESS AND THE BUSINESS IS THAT I HAVE FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE OF A LOT

OPERATOR THAT YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT THAT'S A PICTURE TO THE GLOBAL HEADQUARTERS TAKEN FRIDAY MORNING NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING ROUGHLY -- BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE THIS PLAYED AS A LIKE IT'S BEEN OPEN FOR WEEKS -- THIS FOURTEEN HUNDRED SCHOOLS BEING OPERATED OUT OF THIS FACILITY ON THE LEGITIMATE OPERATORS AND A DIRE INDUSTRY EVEN EXAMPLE WE OPERATE OUR SCHOOLS IN OTHER STATES WE CURRENTLY INVESTING HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN OUR CURRICULUM IMPROVEMENT -- IS THAT GOING TO BE OFFERED IN NEW YORK AND OTHER STATES WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO INCENTIVE TO IMPROVE OUR OUR COURSE AND -- SOME OF THE COURSES

PROGRAM SO IT ACTUALLY MOVES MARKETS THE WAY CALIFORNIA NEEDS IT TOO IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE OUR STATE'S PULLED TRANSPORTATION GOALS WE NEED TO ATTRACT BUYERS AT ALL INCOME LEVELS AND GEOGRAPHIES THE C. B. R. P. PROGRAM CURRENTLY DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HANDLE THE PRESENT AND GROWING DEMAND FOR CLEAN VEHICLES THE PROGRAM IS ALSO NOT CURRENTLY EQUIPPED TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT INCENTIVES TO BRING NEW TYPES OF BUYERS INTO THE FOLD MORE CALIFORNIAN FOR MEANS COULD BE ENJOYING THE BENEFITS OF C. B. R. P. BUT THEY ARE CURRENTLY UNABLE TO UNDER THE EXISTING STATUS QUO FAR FROM SET UP FOR SUCCESS THE C. B. R. P. PROGRAM HINGES ON PRECARIOUS STOP AND START FUNDING AB TEN FORTY SIX WOULD REFOCUS ATTENTION ON THE BEST WAY TO FUND THE C. B. R. P. SO THAT THE PROGRAM DELIVERS MARKET TRANSFORMATION AND RESTORES MUCH NEEDED CONSUMER CONFIDENCE BY DIRECTING THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE TREASURER'S OFFICE TO LOOK INTO OTHER OPTIONS FOR LEVERAGING EXISTING FUNDING SOURCES THIS BILL CAN GET OUR STATE BACK ON TRACK AND PUT OUR STATE DOLLARS TO BEST USE THIS WILL IN TURN ENSURE THAT WE GET THE MOST VALUE FROM OUR TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS IN OTHER WORDS THIS BILL PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A GOOD HARD LOOK AT THE KIND OF INNOVATIVE REBATE PROGRAM WE NEED TO GET THE JOB DONE AND MOVE THE NEEDLE ON OUR TWENTY THIRTY GOALS IN CLOSING AB TEN FORTY SIX SIX TO SOLVE SEVERAL CHALLENGES THE PRACTICAL MARKET DRIVEN APPROACH THAT WILL MAKE CV ARE PETE MORE EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE AND ROBUST A.

PROGRAM IS VERY IMPORTANT IN A KEY COMPONENT TO GETTING TO THE STATE'S ZEV GOALS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT WHEN THAT THE C. B. R. P. PROGRAM STARTED ITS PURPOSE WAS TO PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE TO GET THE AVERAGE CAR BUYER TO LOOK AT ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE AND CHOOSE THAT OVER ITS INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE COUNTERPART OVER TIME THE ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM IS ALSO BEEN EQUITY HOW DO WE HELP FOLKS OF LOWER AND MODERATE INCOMES ALSO GET INTO THESE VEHICLES WE THINK BOTH HER OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS LEAH SO WITH OUR WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE WORK OF THE AUTHOR IN CLARIFYING SOME ISSUES WE INITIALLY RAISED SOME CONCERNS AND STILL HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO MAKING SURE THAT THE BILL IS TECH NEUTRAL -- ALTHOUGH WE DO THINK THE AMENDMENTS ARE A LONG WAY TOWARDS -- TOWARDS UP IN THE BILL SO WE DID HAVE SOME CONCERNS ALSO WITH THE LACK OF LEGISLATIVE CONTROL OVER AIR BEES USE OF FUNDS AND WE HOPE THAT THE WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE AMENDMENT SAYS PRESENTED -- WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL AND PRINT SO WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN REMOVE OPPOSITION OKAY THANK YOU YOU'RE ON THE HAVE A CALIFORNIA FEELS INCONVENIENCE ALIGNS WITH ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE CHAMBER DO YOU THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THE RECENT AMENDMENTS THANKS I'M JUST SIGH YOUNG ABOUT FOR THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL GAS VEHICLES COALITION I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE CHAMBER I'M IN ARE WAITING TO SEE THESE AMENDMENTS AND PRINT ALSO ON BEHALF OF CLEAN ENERGY I WAS ASKED TO RELAY THOSE SAME COMMENTS AND ALONG WITH THAT ON BEHALF OF THE BIO ENERGY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED SPECIFICALLY FOR TWO REASONS NUMBER ONE WE BELIEVE THIS BILL SHOULD BE AMENDED TO BE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL ARE WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL SHOULD BE AMENDED TO IT DRESSED LIFECYCLE EMISSIONS THANK YOU AFTERNOON I MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARGOT PARKS AND THE HAVE THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION -- SAME CONCERNS AS ECHO LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE THE BILL AND PRINT I DO THINK THAT THE SECURITIZATION ISSUE STILL NEEDS -- A LOT MORE WORK TO SEE WHAT THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE WHAT FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE USED I THINK THAT'S STILL SERIOUS OUTSTANDING ISSUE -- AND THE BILL LOOK LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS AND MEMBERS RECORD ASKINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED BIO FEELS ALLIANCE IN OPPOSITION WIENER -- ERIN ORTEGA'S TO THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS ARE WE APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THIS ON THE NUMBER AND THE STAFF HAVE DONE ON THIS BILL I'M A REALLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE INTENT OF THE BILL BUT WE'D LIKE TO SEE SOME LANGUAGE AROUND EQUITY ON HAND AND HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ON THE FUNDING OF IT -- WE LOOK FOR THE WORKING WITH BOTH OF YOU OKAY -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER PERHAPS -- IF YOU WANT TO GO OVER THE JUST THE RESPONSE TO ENTER THE AMENDMENTS BECAUSE I THINK IT PERHAPS CLEARER FOR IS A LOT OF THE OPPOSITION AMENDMENTS OF ONE IT SHOULD GO THROUGH THOSE OF YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE MINUTES FIRST THING THERE WAS THE CONCERN THAT THE BILL WOULD ALLOW OR DID NOT DISCUSS THIS ISSUE AROUND I ACTUALLY CHARGING CHARGING FEES ON GAS CARS TO PAY FOR THE CLEAN CARS THE CODE OF PHOEBE THE CALL FEEDBACK OF OUR FREE BIT I DON'T KNOW SIR BECAUSE I JUST WANT AS MUCH FOR HIS FATE IN ENGLISH RATHER THAN A TERMINOLOGY WE DON'T WANT TO START YEAH TERMINOLOGY THE CAR WE TOOK A MOMENT ABSOLUTE CLARIFIED THAT THAT WAS NOT THE INTENTION OR THE YOU KNOW AND IT FUNDING STREAM ASSEMBLY BUDGET CHAIR I I HAVE ARE REALLY STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT HOW MONEY GETS SPENT AND WHERE KIDS IN THIS MONEY THIS BILL DOESN'T APPROPRIATE ANY MONEY TAKE A LONGER LOOK AT THIS PROGRAM AND TO SEE WHAT WE COULD DO TO MAKE IT BETTER THE HOPE IS THAT WE CAN OBVIOUSLY FLUSH THAT OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE FOR FOR ME IT'S ALSO OKAY LET A RB FLUSH IT OUT AS WELL SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO MEET AND TO FIND A FUNDING SOURCE BUT AGAIN -- IF IT TAKES LONGER I THINK IT'S TOTALLY FINE FOR A RB TO DO THAT TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE NOW OBVIOUSLY IN ORDER TO UTILIZE ANY FUNDS TO UTILIZE THE FUNDING MY EXPECTATIONS THEY WOULD HAVE TO COME BACK TO LEGISLATURE TO GET APPROVAL FOR THAT -- SO THAT'S TOTALLY WILL OVERSIGHT OF ANY PLAN THAT COMES OUT OF THIS SO I THINK THAT GIVES US SO THE BALL COMES BACK ON OUR CORD AFTER THEY COME UP WITH A PLAN SEXUALLY AND AGAIN -- WE WE DON'T PICK ANY SITES IN THIS TECHNOLOGY WHAT WE DO IS AGAIN THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM HAS A CERTAIN SET STANDARDS ON WHAT KINDS OF VEHICLES FOUND AND SO WE HAVE NOT SPOKEN ON THAT PARTICULAR SHOW OKAY OKAY THANK YOU -- DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THERE'S A MOTION QUESTION SIR GALGIANI ORIGINALLY I WASN'T GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THE BILL BECAUSE I AS I UNDERSTOOD IT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IFFY ON THOSE WHO WERE DRIVING GAS DRIVEN VEHICLES WHICH MANY ARE IN MY AREA AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY BECAUSE THEY QUITE FRANKLY CAN'T AFFORD ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND DON'T HAVE THE CREDIT RATINGS WITH THE CREDIT ABILITY TO BUY AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE AND SHOULDN'T BE PENALIZED BECAUSE THEY'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO COMMUTE TO THE JOBS RICH AREAS YOU'VE CHANGED THE BILL I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT BUT IT'S WITH THE CAVEAT THAT YOU HAVE MADE THAT CHANGE SHOULD HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THAT MY CONSTITUENTS CONSTITUENTS WON'T BE PAYING THE PENALTY ABSOLUTELY NOT THAT'S WE WANT TO TAKE THAT LANGUAGE TO CLARIFY WE UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME ISSUES AROUND HOW TO INVOLVED WORKING CLASS FAMILIES IN THIS PROGRAM WHAT I WOULD SAY THAT THAT IS THERE THERE IS A -- A CASH FOR CLUNKERS PROGRAM WE'VE ALSO CONSIDERED PROGRAM TO INCLUDE USED VEHICLES I THINK THE CHALLENGE FOR MANY WORKING FAMILIES THOSE HOUSEHOLDS DON'T NECESSARILY BUY USED CAR BUY NEW CARS THEY BUY USED CARS YES SO THIS IS A NEW CAR PROGRAM IS OBVIOUSLY I THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY INTERESTED OPENNESS ON MY END TO CONTINUE THAT DIALOGUE TO FIGURE OUT HOW CAN WE BETTER SERVE A USED CAR MARKET BECAUSE THE GREAT THING ABOUT NOW THAT WE HAVE CARS THAT HAVE BEEN ON BEEN OUT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS YOU NOW HAVE A USED CAR MARKET THREE FOUR YEARS AGO FIVE YEARS AGO YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE USED CAR MARKET BECAUSE ALL THE TECHNOLOGY WAS NEW SO I THINK IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIGURE OUT AGAIN HOW TO -- PROVIDE A BROADER INCOME SPECTRUM SO I THINK WE'RE STILL WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT THIS THERE IS A AGAIN A CASH FOR CLUNKERS PROGRAM MY HE AT E. S. M. T. MFA I WAS FORGET THAT HOW THE ACRONYM WORKS -- IT'S BETTER JUST TO CALL IT LIKE A CASH FOR CLUNKERS PROGRAMS OF DOUBT PROGRAMS IS STILL THERE WE DON'T WE DON'T TOUCH THAT BUT I THINK -- WE DEFINITELY WANTED TO CLARIFY THE WHOLE FEE ISSUE THAT WAS UPSET NOT THE INTENTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU OF OTHER MANY QUESTIONS OKAY THE MOTION SENATE ROTH DO YOU HAVE A CLOSE THANKS FOR ALL THE ROBUST

DIRECTS THE A A RP TO CONSIDER ALLOWING OIL AND GAS COMPANIES TO CLAIM AN INNOVATIVE PRODUCTION METHOD CREDIT FOR USING RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS DELIVERED BY A COMMON CARRIER PIPELINE RIGHT AT THE SOURCE REDUCES METHANE EMISSIONS WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HELLO CARBON IT HELLO CARBON FUEL STANDARD OR ELSE CFS IS PRIMARILY PRIMARILY DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE THE USE OF CLEAN LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION FUELS IN CALIFORNIA THE PROGRAM IS ALSO INTENDED TO REDUCE EMISSIONS DURING THE ACTUAL PROCESS OF PRODUCING TRANSPORTATION FUELS AS SUCH THE PROGRAM ALLOWS OIL REFINING OPERATIONS TO GENERATE EL CFS CREDITS WHEN SWITCHING FROM TRADITIONAL NATURAL GAS TO RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS HOWEVER THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT INCLUDE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION DESPITE THE LARGE AMOUNT OF NATURAL GAS REQUIRED BY ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY METHODS INCLUSION OF THESE PRODUCERS COULD HELP REDUCE EMISSIONS AND CREATE A HEALTHY MARKET FOR RENEWAL THAT NATURAL GAS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AB ELEVEN NINETY FIVE DIRECT THEIR AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO CONSIDER EXPANDING LCF OF CREDITS TO OIL AND GAS PRODUCERS WHO REDUCE METHANE EMISSIONS HERE IN CALIFORNIA BY SWITCHING TO RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS IN THEIR OPERATIONS AND HERE'S TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT ARE THE IS THE -- CALIFORNIA'S STATE -- PIPE TRADES AND I BELIEVE OTHERS MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU -- SPEAKERS IN FAVOR YEAH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE CALIFORNIA STATE PIPE TRADES COUNCIL -- WE VERY MUCH SUPPORT THIS BILL THIS IS ALL ABOUT GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION IN THE PRODUCTION OF OF GAS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE OF EXTRACTION OF OIL AND GAS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WE'VE DONE SO MUCH

THE OFFSET IS FROM CALIFORNIA THEY GIVE THEM CREDIT UNDER THE INNOVATIVE CRUDE -- ACCOUNTING METHOD METHOD SYSTEM THAT'S A LONG WORD NOT SO IT ALSO BY THE WAY HELPS OUR MEMBERS BECAUSE THE MORE OF A
