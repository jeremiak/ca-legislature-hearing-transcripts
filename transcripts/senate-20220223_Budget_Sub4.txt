OKAY SO I HOPE YOU CAN ALL SEE THAT THIS WILL BE WELL WE'LL GET TO SHORTLY IS GONNA BE THE FIRST FIGURE. OUT WHAT IS YOUR LAST NAME STAFF- KIRSTINE K. E. R. S. T. E. I. N. VERNALIS. THANK YOU SIR ARE MOST UPON WAS JUST JOINED US. THANK YOU MOST ASPECTS OF CALIFORNIA'S CANNABIS TAXES COME FROM TO LOS. PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR OF TWENTY SIXTEEN AND S. B. NINETY FOUR OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN A PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR ESTABLISHED WHOSE STATEWIDE CANNABIS TAXES A RETAIL EXCISE TAX AND A CULTIVATION TAX US TO THE RETAIL EXCISE TAX RAISES ABOUT 80% OF THE REVENUE AND THE CULTIVATION TAX RAISES THE REMAINING 20% SO. AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE FIGURE HERE THAT I'M SHARING OF THE ZOOM IN ON IT A LITTLE BIT. AREN'T REVENUES FROM THESE TAXES INITIALLY- WERE PRETTY WEAK THE FIRST QUARTER TWO BUT THEN THEY GREW QUITE RAPIDLY AFTER THAT ARE FROM FISCAL YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE REVENUE GREW BY ABOUT SIXTY THAT 6% PER YEAR- BUT REVENUE GROWTH OVER THE LAST FEW QUARTERS INCLUDING AN UPDATE RELEASED BY THE ADMINISTRATION VERY RECENTLY AFTER WE PUT TOGETHER THIS GRAPH HAS. BEEN A MUCH SLOWER. I AM SO ALL SURE THAT. NUMBER AT. SCREEN THERE TOLD NEXT- SO- WILL COVER JUST A FEW THE BASIC FEATURES OF THOSE TWO STATEWIDE EXCISE TAXES STATEWIDE CANNABIS TAXES THAT I MENTIONED AS WELL AS LOCAL TAXES SO FIRST THE RETAIL EXCISE TAX OUR PROP SIXTY FOUR SET THE STATE'S EXCISE TAX RATE AT FIFTEEN PERCENT. OF THE RETAIL PRICE SB NINETY FOUR MOVED THE REMITTANCE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS TAX FOR RETAILERS TO DISTRIBUTORS. BUT WHEN RETAILERS BUYING CANNABIS PRODUCTS FROM DISTRIBUTORS NOBODY KNOWS FOR SURE AT THAT TIME WHAT THE ULTIMATE RETAIL PRICE WILL BE SO TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR DISTRIBUTORS TO REMIT THE TAX SB NINETY FOUR EFFECTIVELY TURNS THIS SO CALLED RETAIL TAX INTO WHOLESALE TAX FOR MOST TRANSACTIONS. THIS DIRECTS THE DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION TO ESTIMATE THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE RETAIL MARKUP AND THEY USE THAT NUMBER TO ESTIMATE THE WHOLESALE TAX RATE THAT'S EQUIVALENT ON AVERAGE CHIU US 15% RETAIL. RIGHT NOW THAT TAX RATE IS 27% OF THE WHOLESALE PRICE. THE OTHER STATE WIDE CAMPUS TAX AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IS THE CULTIVATION TAX. THIS TAX IS A FIXED DOLLAR AMOUNT PER AN OUNCE- WITH DIFFERENT RATES FOR THREE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF HARVESTED CANNABIS. PROP SIXTY FOUR ESTABLISHED AN ANNUAL INFLATION ADJUSTMENTS FOR THESE TAX RATES. ARE WHICH KEEPS THE REAL TAX RATE CONSTANT OVER THE LONG TERM. SB NINETY FOUR- MADE DISTRIBUTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR REMITTING THIS TAX TO THE STATE JUST AS IT DID FOR THE RETAIL ACCESS TO. IN THE THIRD MAJOR PIECE OF THE PUZZLE IN ADDITION TO THOSE- TO STATEWIDE CANNABIS TAXES I IS THE CANNABIS TAXES THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IMPOSE ON BUSINESSES ALL UP AND DOWN THE CAMPUS SUPPLY CHAIN. IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE ESTIMATED THAT THE TOTAL STATEWIDE AVERAGE LOCAL CANNABIS TAX RATE WAS ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT. TO A 14% TAX ON RETAIL SALES. SO NOW I WILL SHARE A FIGURE I'LL TRY TO SCREEN SURE AGAIN THAT ILLUSTRATES THE FLOW OF TAX PAYMENTS FORTY RETAIL EXCISE TAX AND FOR THE CULTIVATION. OKAY WE'LL GO- OVER TO THIS FIGURES HERE AND I'LL TRY. SET REID ZERO KEEP A WHOLE THING. THERE CITY. OKAY. SO THIS IS YOUR THIS ILLUSTRATES THE FLOWER OF TAX PAYMENTS FOR THE RETAIL EXCISE TAX AND THE CULTIVATION TAX- SOME UNDER CURRENT LAN BEFORE BUSINESSES MAKE TAX PAYMENTS TO THE STATE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF OTHER PAYMENTS WE HAVE OUR PAYMENTS FROM BUSINESSES TO OTHER BUSINESSES- SO IN THE CASE THE CULTIVATION TAX THE I TAX LIABILITY ORIGINATES OF THE CULTIVATOR AND THEN THAT PAYMENTS FLOWS SOMETIMES THROUGH SEVERAL BUSINESSES UNTIL IT GETS TO THE LAST DISTRIBUTOR- AND SO THAT'S REALLY A QUITE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM LESTER FOR THE RETAIL EXCISE TAX IT'S JUST SORT OF- FROM THE RETAILER TO BE LAST DISTRIBUTOR AT THAT. POINT I DISTRICT U. S. OF ONE OF THE ISSUE WITH THE TAXES- AND JUST TO UP- I WILL HIGHLIGHTS. ON SO OF THE WRECK. ARE FROM A REPORT THAT OUR OFFICE PUBLISHED IN TWENTY NINETEEN WHICH WAS REQUIRED BY PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR SO THESE RAM RECOMMENDATIONS REFLECT THE SEQUENCE OF. THREE MAJOR POLICY CHOICES REGARDING CANNABIS TAX THE FIRST THERE'S THE CHOICE OF WHAT TYPE OF TAX TO LEVY. OUR PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION IN OUR REPORT WAS TO REPLACE THE STATE'S CANNABIS TAXES WITH A- C. BASED OR TIERED AND ALARM TAX ALTERNATIVELY IF EASE OF ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE IS THE TOP POLICY PRIORITY HE LEGISLATURE COULDN'T STICK WITH THE RETAIL ACCESS TAX. EITHER WAY WE RECOMMENDED ELIMINATING THE CULTIVATION. SECOND WE RECOMMENDED COLLECTING TAXES FROM BUSINESSES THAT PARTICIPATE DIRECTLY IN WHATEVER ACTIVITY IS BEING TAXED SO THAT WOULD MEAN FOR EXAMPLE COLLECTING THE RESALE ACCESS TAX FOR RETAILERS RATHER THAN. DISTRIBUTORS AND THIRD WE NOTED THAT THE LEGISLATURE REASONABLY COULD CONSIDER- A WIDE RANGE OF TAX RATES FOR WHATEVER TAX IT ULTIMATELY SELECT. SO THAT CONCLUDES MY PREPARED REMARKS AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM GREG MINOR WITH THE CITY OF OAKLAND. AND THERE CAN YOU HEAR ME OK I CAN'T. VERY GOOD AFTERNOON- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF SPEAKERS SO. I WILL TRY TO BE BRIEF- JUST A QUICK INTRODUCTION I'VE OVERSEEN THE PERMITTING OF CANNABIS BUSINESSES IN THE CITY OF OAKLAND SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN- AND IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN I CO AUTHORED. WITH MY COLLEAGUE DARLING PLAN- THE CITY OF OAKLAND'S RACE IN EQUITY ANALYSIS ARE CANNABIS INDUSTRY AND CREATED THE- NATION'S FIRST CANNABIS EQUITY PROGRAM- SO IN TERMS OF THE- THE TOPIC AT ISSUE TODAY- I WOULD OFFER THAT. THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY SHOULD BE TAXED SIMILAR TO ANY OTHER INDUSTRY- BUT THE QUESTION BEFORE THE COMMITTEE I WOULD OFFER IS WHETHER THE TAX RATES AT THE STATE LEVEL HAVE FALLEN OUT OF BALANCE WITH MARKET CONDITIONS TO THE POINT THAT WE ARE DISCOURAGING. ENTREPRENEURS AND CONSUMERS FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE REGULATED MARKET AN INTERN EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE REGULATED MARKET- AND I THINK. EVERY INDUSTRY- YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY SAY WE'RE BEING TAXED TOO HIGH IF YOU LOWER THE TAXES WE DO X. Y. Z. BUT I THINK WHAT'S CRITICAL FOR THE COMMITTEE AND THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. IS THAT THE ANALYZE THESE QUESTIONS ARE WITHIN CANNABIS IS UNIQUE HISTORICAL- IN PRESENT DAY- CONTEXT. SO IN TERMS OF HISTORICAL CONTEXT YOU HAVE THE WARRANT DRUGS WHICH IS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED PEOPLE COLOR PARTICULARLY AFRICAN AMERICANS. I WAS IN NUMEROUS AND I DIRECT AND INDIRECT CONSEQUENCES IT PUTS THAT THOSE COMMUNITIES AND EXTREME DISADVANTAGE WHEN TRYING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE REGULATED MARKET- AND THEN YOU HAVE THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS HAD A THRIVING. UNREGULATED MARKET SINCE AT LEAST THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION TWO FIFTEEN IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX. AND THEN WHEN YOU FAST FORWARD TO TODAY IN OUR PRESENT LANDSCAPE- NUMBER ONE YOU HAVE. CANNABIS ENTREPRENEURS YOU'RE LIKELY TO HEAR- ON THE PANEL FACED A NUMBER OF BARRIERS AND IN TERMS OF PARTICIPATING IN THE REGULATED MARKET- FIRST OFF YOU HAVE COMPETITION FROM UNREGULATED MARKET. SECONDLY CANNABIS BUSINESSES ARE BASICALLY BASED AT A HIDDEN TAX FROM. EVERY THE ENTIRE. RANGE OF- THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR LANDLORDS INSURANCE COMPANIES SECURITY COMPANIES ALL CHARGE CANNABIS BUSINESSES A HIGHER RATE THAN A NON CANNABIS- EQUIVALENT MIGHT BE CHARGED. CANNABIS BUSINESSES LACK ACCESS TO BANK BANKING YOU CAN'T GO TO A BANK AND SAY CAN I PLEASE HAVE A LOAN TO START A CANNABIS BUSINESS BECAUSE OF. FEDERAL PROHIBITION- IF YOU HAVE CANNABIS BUSINESSES BEING TARGETED BY ARMED BURGLARS AND ROBBERS- LOOKING TO TAKE THEIR THEIR PRODUCTS OR CASH BECAUSE OF THE BANKING ISSUE. AND THEN- I THINK I MAYBE ALLUDED TO A QUIRK BUT OPERATORS THEN HAVE TO PAY FOR SECURITY- JUST TESTED OPERATING A REGULATED MARKET. AND THEN- SECONDLY CANNABIS ENTREPRENEURS AND CONSUMERS CAN JUST PARTICIPATE NON REGULATED MARKET- I DON'T KNOW HOW OTHER INDUSTRIES HAVE THAT SAME OPTION- AT LEAST NOT KNOW WHERE TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE IN THE CAN. THREE AND THEN- IF ENTREPRENEURS CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE REGULATED MARKET THAT MINIMIZES OPPORTUNITIES FOR HIRING EMPLOYEES- SO. IN CONCLUSION- THE CITY OF OAKLAND HUGE HUGE- ENTREPRENEURS AND% EMPLOYMENT. WITHIN THE REGULATED MARKET AND I AM ENCOURAGED TO CAN- COMMITTEE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO. TAKE STEPS IN THAT DIRECTION THIS YEAR- TO ENSURE THAT THE REGULATED. INDUSTRY REFLECTS CALIFORNIANS- TRUE DIVERSITY AND I'M AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS UNTIL THREE PM- WHEN AT THE HOP OFF AND THEN. I CAN FOLLOW UP WITH THE STAFF OF THE EMAIL G. MINOR AT OAKLAND CA DOT GOV- IF ANY QUESTIONS COME UP AFTER THREE O'CLOCK. THANK YOU AGAIN. FOR A DOCTOR TO MAYBE SPEAK. THANK YOU MINER- I WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A HARD STOP AT THREE ORDINARILY WE ASK FOR QUESTIONS AFTER EVERYONE HAS- PRESENTED. BUT I'M GOING TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION NOT RIGHT NOW BUT BEFORE THREE SO THAT IF ANYONE HAVE ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS FOR YOU YOUR AVAILABLE TO ANSWER THEM. NO PROBLEM THANK YOU OKAY GREAT SO NEXT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A HAMBURGER CENTER WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SUPERNOVA WOMEN. WE SEE YOU. HI THERE- AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR INVITING ME TO JOIN THE DISCUSSION TODAY. HI MY NAME IS AMBER CENTER I'M A CO FOUNDER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND CHAIRMAN OF SUPERNOVA WOMEN AT SUPERNOVA WOMEN AS A FIVE OH ONE C. THREE NONPROFIT FOUNDED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. OUR AND WE WORK TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE HI AND THE REGULATED CANNABIS MARKET. ADDITIONALLY THE CEO OF MAKER HOUSE ARE A CANNABIS MANUFACTURING DISTRIBUTOR AND BRAND HOUSE ARE HEADQUARTERED IN OAKLAND. AND I OPERATE AND MANAGE EQUITY WORKS INCUBATOR WHICH IS A SHARED MANUFACTURING FACILITY THANK YOU BATES SOCIAL EQUITY OPERATORS IN OAKLAND. I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK ABOUT THE CRAFT CANNABIS INDUSTRY AND- ARE WE ARE IN CRISIS AND I WANT TO ENSURE THAT MY COMMUNITY SURVIVES. DEMANDING THE ELIMINATION OF THE CULTIVATION TAX AND THE SUSPENSION OF THE EXCISE TAX FOR SOCIAL EQUITY OPERATORS FOR A MINIMUM OF SIX YEARS. FOR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS OF BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE WERE LOCKED UP AND DENIED FREEDOMS FOR THE SAME ACTIVITY THAT IS ENRICHING THE PURSE STRINGS OF MANY LARGE CANNABIS CORPORATIONS TODAY. THERE ARE STILL MANY BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE AND CAR SERRATED FOR CANNABIS. EMERALD TRIANGLE LEGACY FARMERS HAVE ALSO SUFFERED BECAUSE OF THE FAILED WAR ON DRUGS. PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR HAS FALLEN SHORT ON ITS PROMISE TO RIGHT THE WRONGS INFLICTED UPON BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY THE WAR ON DRUGS. IT HAS ALSO PERPETUATED REGRESSIVE WAR ON DRUGS TWO POINT OH POLICIES THROUGH OPPRESSIVE TAXATION WHICH MUST END. AND THIS IS OUR CRIED FOR HELP. DURING THE WEEK OF NOVEMBER FIFTEENTH AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE ARMED ROBBERS IN OAKLAND AND SAN FRANCISCO FORCED THEIR WAY INTO MORE THAN TWENTY LICENSED CANNABIS BUSINESSES. VANDALIZING STORES OFFICES AND FACILITIES. HUMILITY SIMPLY BE SMALL AND MOSTLY BLACK AND BROWN AND EQUITY LICENSE BUSINESSES SUFFERED OVER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN LOSSES. EVEN MY INCUBATOR EQUITY WORKS WAS BROKEN INTO AND BURGLARIZED. WHEN WE SUFFER LOSSES LIKE THIS IN ADDITION TO THE INCREASINGLY ONEROUS TAXES. WE DO NOT HAVE THE RUN WAY TO RECOVER. ROBBERIES ARE PLAGUING SMALL BLACK BROWN IN EQUITY OPERATORS LIKE ME. BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF SAFE BANKING ROBBERS KNOW THAT THERE'S A CHANCE THAT WE MAY HAVE A STAGE STOCKED WITH CASH. THERE'S ALSO THE LACK OF INSURANCE. MOST CANNABIS BUSINESSES ARE SOUND AND LOW INCOME HIGH CRIME AREAS WHERE THEFT INSURANCE ON OUR INVENTORY IS NOT EVEN AN OPTION. THIS PROBLEM IS NOT EXCLUSIVE TO BRICK AND MORTAR OPERATIONS. ARE DELIVERY DRIVERS ARE AT GREAT RISK VENTURING OUT ON THEIR OWN WITH NO PROTECTION. WE WERE DEEMED ESSENTIAL EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC. WHERE IS OUR SENSE OF RELIEF AND ARE ESSENTIAL EIGHT. THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA NEED US OUR INDUSTRY AND BUSINESSES ARE WORTH SAVING. THE PRICE OF CANNABIS HAS CRASHED AS LOW AS THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER POUND THE SET AT A FIXED RATE OF ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE DOLLARS AND INCREASES ANNUALLY. SMALL CANNABIS CULTIVATORS HAVE BEEN SET UP FOR DISASTER THIS IS NOT SUSTAINABLE. FACING THE INCREASED THREAT OF ROBBERIES AND VIOLENCE PLUMMETING CANNABIS PRICES AND INSTABILITY IN THE MARKET AND THE PILING ON OF INCREASED TAXATION IS PROVING TO BE UNBEARABLE FOR OPERATORS. I'M DEMANDING DEMANDING RELIEF FROM MY COMMUNITY TO ENSURE OUR SURVIVAL. IF WE DON'T SURVIVE THERE WILL BE NO CANNABIS TAX REVENUE. THIS IS NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE STATE. PLEASE ADOPT RELEASED AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE. RESCUE ARE ESSENTIAL INDUSTRY AND SAVE OUR CALIFORNIA'S CRAFT CANNABIS MARKET. PLEASE HELP US BUILD BACK WHAT WE'VE LOST THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU FOR THAT M. AND SO NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM TEAMSTERS AND I HOPE I GOT YOUR LAST NAME YOU NAILED IT YEAH. IT'S GREAT TO HEAR MOTIONS RIGHT NOW GO THERE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SOME MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS OUR POSITION REGARDING CANNABIS TAX COLLECTION MY NAME IS KRISTIN HOW TO WALK I SERVICE THAT CANNABIS DIVISION DIRECTOR FOR. THE INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS- SIX SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE TEAMSTERS HAVE SUPPORTED AND CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE COLLECTION OF CANNABIS TAXES AND REMITTANCE I'M SAID TAXES AND THE DISTRIBUTOR. WE FEEL THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND TO ENSURE THAT ALL TAXES ARE PROPERLY COLLECTED AND REMITTED TO THE PROPERTY TAX COLLECTION AGENCY. DISTRIBUTION SERVICE OR CANCER AS CHECKS AND BALANCES AND HELPS ENSURE COMPLIANCE. WE DO FEEL THAT IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE DISTRIBUTOR FROM VENDORS THAT DELAY TAX PAYMENT WERE NOT PAID AT ALL ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS MIGHT BE CONSIDERED THESE PROPOSALS SHOULD STRENGTHEN THE ROLE OF THE DISTRIBUTOR. WE'VE SEEN HOW STRONG AND WELL REGULATED DISTRIBUTOR SYSTEM IN THE ALCOHOL INDUSTRY. HAS LED TO SIGNIFICANT UNION DENSITY AND EFFICIENT AND ROBUST TAX COLLECTION IT IS TOO SOON TO DISMANTLE THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF A CANNABIS DISTRIBUTOR THERE ARE OTHER MEANS THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED THAT CAN AID IN REDUCING THE ILLICIT MARKET AND BOLSTER TAX COLLECTION. I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO REITERATE THAT THE TEACHERS WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD THE LINE WITH OUR LABOR PARTNERS WHO ARE SCHEDULED TO SPEAK AFTER ME I KNOW THAT YOU'RE C. W.'S EXPLORING A TAX CREDIT FOR CANNABIS EMPLOYERS. THAT CREATE HIGH ROAD CAREER SUSTAINING JOBS IN THE INDUSTRY WHO WERE SUPPORTIVE IN CONCEPT AND LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MORE. OTHERWISE OUR POSITION IS REMAIN THE SAME SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE TAX COLLECTION REMAIN AT THE DISTRIBUTOR LEVEL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. WE HAVE NOW TERRY BRANDON S. E. I. U. PARDON. HI IS KERRY I THOUGHT- GAS TAX BUT I'M HAPPY TO COMMENT I WILL KEEP IT- VERY QUICK IN THE INTERESTS TIME- S. CI USE PERSPECTIVE IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF OUR LABOR PARTNERS WE SUPPORT ALL THEIR EFFORTS IN THIS ARENA BUT THE COMPLICATION WITH THE CURRENT- TAX. AND STRATEGY IS THAT WE'VE DEDICATED A LOT OF THE REVENUE WHO- PROJECT INTEREST BOTH TO ASK YOU ARE YOU AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES AND WHILE TAX FROM WHICH STORES AND- THE SORT OF MAX- WE UNDERSTAND. THAT UPDATED NEED TO PRESERVE DISTENDED TREE AND I KEEP IT GOING IT'S IMPORTANT. AS IS THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE REVENUE STREAMS THAT ARE GOING TO THE PROGRAMS ARE NOT IN IRAQ HAVING SAID THAT IT SEEMS IMPORTANT THAT IF THE GOVERNOR DID MINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE SEE FIT TO RESTRUCTURE THIS REVENUE- COLLECTION AND REVENUE STREAM. THAT THEY ENSURE THERE ARE NO IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS GAMBLE WHICH WE CONSIDERED TO BE. ON THAT NEWS SURE THAT WE PRESERVE THE REVENUES THAT ARE FLOWING TO- THINGS LIKE CHILD CARE. EARLY EDUCATION PREVENTION. HEY GIRL OUT. UP AND TO END WOULD WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT ONE THERE WERE A SENSE ON WHATEVER STRATEGIES DEVISED AND SECONDLY THAT ANY REVENUES ARE BACK FILLED TO THE PRESUMED LEVELS THEY WOULD BE UNDER THE CURRENT SCENARIO. I THINK THEY'RE SUFFICIENT ONE TIME MONEY IN THE BUDGET- THIS YEAR AND GOING FORWARD THANK YOU COULD SET ASIDE SOME TO ENSURE THAT- IF THERE IS A LOSS IN REVENUE IF THERE IS A DROP IN REVENUES. THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE CONTINUE G. TO BE FUNDED AT THEIR EXPECTED LEVELS. BY THAT AT ALL TURN OVER THE NEXT SPEAKER THANK YOU. AND NEXT WE WOULD HAVE- LET'S SEE. CHRISTIAN HYDERABAD YES WHICH ONE.

IT IS NO SURPRISE TO THIS COMMITTEE THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES THIS YOUNG LEGALIZED CANNABIS INDUSTRY CURRENTLY. AS CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO BATTLE A THRIVING ILLICIT MARKET. CALIFORNIA'S ILLICIT MARKET IS ESTIMATED TO BE ROUGHLY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS ABOUT THAT WHICH IS ABOUT DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF LEGAL SALES AND SOME ESTIMATES HAVE THIS AS EVEN HIGHER. A THRIVING ILLICIT MARKET IS HAVING AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON WORKERS IN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY SUCH AS EMPLOYERS BEING ABLE TO MAINTAIN HIGH WORKER STANDARDS AND EXPANDING THE WORKFORCE. CURRENTLY I UNIONIZE CANNABIS SHOPS WERE SAYING LAYOFFS AND A SHOCKING RATE OF UPWARDS OF SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT. AS ILLEGAL AS THE LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO BE TAXED UP 270% IN SOME REGIONS IF THE W. WOULD LIKE TO SEE TARGETED RELIEF IN THE FORM OF TAX CREDITS. FOR HIGH ROAD EMPLOYERS IN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY TO BETTER COMPETE WITH THE ILLICIT CANNABIS MARKET. UCW STRONGLY BELIEVES THAT LICENSED CANNABIS OPERATORS WHO DO THE RIGHT THING NEW TO THE LEGAL REGULATED MARKET ARE PAYING LIVING WAGES OFFERING WORKER BENEFITS PROMOTING HEALTH AND SAFETY AT THE WORKPLACE AND PARTNERING ON AN OFFERING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS.

BEING SAID WE WOULD ECHO THE SENTIMENTS EXPRESSED BY MY COLLEAGUE S. YEAH YOU AND HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING CHILD CARE FUNDING IN TAX NEED TO GROW THESE REVENUES. LONG TERM. GOING TO DEPARTMENTS SOCIAL SERVICES APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED NINETY TWO POINT THREE MILLION OF PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR FUNDS WERE ALLOCATED IN FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO FOR CHAPTER SLOTS. IS DOLLARS ALLOW AN ESTIMATED TWENTY SIX THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED YOUNGSTERS TO RECEIVE CHILD CARE.

WE ARE CONSIDERING THE VARIOUS TAX PROPOSALS AND THE CAUTION AGAINST APPROACH THAT PICKED A SPECIAL PROGRAMS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER ESPECIALLY DURING A BUDGET SURPLUS. AT THIS POINT WE ARE OPEN TO A TAX BILL AND CONCEPT. LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE MINISTRATION OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO THREAD THE NEEDLE TO HELP STABILIZE LEGAL CAMPUS MARKET. THANK YOU. THANK YOU REVIEW. OUR NEXT WITNESS WOULD BE KAREN WOULD SEND. GIVE US CONNECTIONS CONNECTIONS. BEVERLY YOU. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND STAFF AND KAREN WHAT'S AND DIRECTOR OF COMPLIANCE WITH HUMAN BRANDS THANK YOU FOR THIS IMPORTANT HEARING AND I APPLAUD THE LEADERSHIP THAT BRINGS US HERE TODAY SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE STATE HAS COLLECTED THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN CANNABIS TAX REVENUE BUT STILL TWO THIRDS OF THEIR SALES OCCUR AND UNLICENSED KENNELS IN OTHER WORDS THERE'S ROUGHLY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OF UNTAPPED REVENUE ON THE TABLE. TO ENSURE THE VIABILITY OF THE CAMPUS TAX FUND AND CRITICAL PROGRAMS THAT RELY ON ITS FUNDING I'M HERE TODAY TO URGE SUPPORT FOR COMPREHENSIVE TAX REFORM THAT INCENTIVIZES PARTICIPATION BY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CONSUMERS AND UNLICENSED OPERATORS I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DIALOGUE WITH YOU DIRECTOR ELIA AND THE PANEL OF WITNESSES ABOUT THE TAX REFORM DESPERATELY NEEDED TO STABILIZE THE LEGAL MARKET AND REALIZE THE GOAL OF PROP SIXTY FOUR. HE WAS IN TWENTY TEN TO POSITIVELY CHANGE HOW THE WORLD VIEWS AND USE OF CANNABIS. J. R. AWARD WINNING PRODUCTS OF THE MOST TRUSTED EDIBLES ON THE MARKET. LIKEWISE CUBA SALES AND SERVICE IS A LEADING STATEWIDE DISTRIBUTOR OFFERING A PORTFOLIO OF. BRANDS ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES PEOPLE AT OUR FACILITY OVER FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE AT OUR FACILITIES IN OAKLAND AND LOS ANGELES. AND OUR PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE IN OVER EIGHT HUNDRED LICENSED OUTLETS IN CALIFORNIA. EVEN AS ONE OF THE LARGEST CANNABIS COMPANIES WE STRUGGLE WITH EXCESSIVE TAXES COSTLY REGULATION UNFAIR COMPETITION FROM THE ILLICIT MARKET. THE COMPOUNDING COSTS OF FEDERAL PROHIBITION AN EXPECTATION TO DELIVER STATE REVENUES BEFORE THE MARKET IS STABILIZE. FOR TEN YEARS WE'VE INVESTED IN AN INDUSTRY THAT IS POISED TO COMPETE NATIONALLY AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO DELIVERING THE REVENUE PROMISED BY LEGALIZATION. UNFORTUNATELY HIGH TAXES PUBLIC WITH LOCAL BANDS DISCOURAGE WIDESPREAD PARTICIPATION IN THE LEGAL MARKET AND LIMIT THE STATE'S ABILITY TO COLLECT REVENUE. THE LEADERSHIP NEEDED NOW IS THE HORSE FIGHT TO AVOID THE SHORT TERM FIX IN FAVOR OF COMPREHENSIVE TAX REFORM BUT INCENTIVIZES ROD PARTICIPATION IN THE LEGAL MARKET BY ALL THE PLAYERS. THE FACTS ARE BLEAK SALES ARE DROPPING REVENUES ARE RETREATING AND CONSUMERS ARE FLEEING THE POLITICO REPORTED THAT HIGH TAXES ON LOCAL BANDS HAVE LED MOST OPERATORS TO CLOSE SHOP. WE'VE FOR PERMISSIVE JURISDICTIONS OR SILENCE OF THE ILLICIT MARKET IN NOVEMBER BDS ANALYTICS REPORTED THAT LEGAL CANNABIS SALES IN CALIFORNIA DROPPED. BY MORE THAN 11% COMPARED TO TWENTY TWENTY AND IS DOWN 8% FROM AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE CDC FACIAL HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A DECREASE IN LEGAL SALES FROM Q. TWO TO Q. FOUR NOTS REFLECTED IN A THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLAR DECREASE IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED CANNABIS TAX FUND ALLOCATION. FIVE YEARS AFTER LEGALIZATION ONLY 20% OF THE MUNICIPALITIES. MADE ANY LEGAL CANNABIS ACTIVITY THE FACT IS THERE ARE FAR FEWER RETAILERS IN THE STATE TODAY THAN THERE WERE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND FOR DISTRIBUTORS THE PROBLEM IS ACUTE WE CAN COLLECT AND REMIT CANNABIS TAXES FROM CULTIVATORS AND RETAILERS WHICH IS A FUNCTION REQUIRING SOPHISTICATED ACCOUNTING HEIGHTEN SECURITY AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND WORKING CAPITAL ALSO FLOAT TIMELY PAYMENT OF EXCISE TAXES. BEFORE THEY'RE COLLECTED FROM THE RETAILERS. TAX COLLECTION BY DISTRIBUTORS IS A FUNCTION OF THE ALCOHOL TRADE THE PROTECTIONS AFFORDED TO ALCOHOL DISTRIBUTORS DO NOT EXIST FOR US. WITHOUT AUTHORITY OR REQUIRES FOR THE FALL PAYMENTS CANNABIS DISTRIBUTORS ARE SITTING ON MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF A. OUR DAT. A BUBBLE THAT NGUYEN BURSTS WILL IMPACT SMALL OPERATORS AND THOSE WITHOUT ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL TO COVER THE LOSS. I'M ENCOURAGED BY TODAY'S HEARING AND THE ARRAY OF TAX PROPOSALS INTRODUCED LAST WEEK. BUT REVENUE NEUTRAL SOLUTIONS WHILE POLITICALLY EXPEDIENT ONLY RESULT IN SHORT TERM RELIEF FOR CURRENT OPERATORS. IT NEITHER INCENTIVIZE PARTICIPATION NOR MOVES THE NEEDLE ON CONSUMER PRICE. EFFECTIVE TAX REFORM SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING. BERMAN A SUSPENSION OF THE CULTIVATION TAX A SIGNIFICANT CUT IN THE EXCISE TAX TO ENCOURAGE CONSUMER PARTICIPATION. INCENTIVES TO SUPPORT MORE RETAIL THROUGHOUT THE STATE. OR FOR DISTRIBUTORS TO BLUNT THE IMPENDING DEATH OF ALL AN ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR SOCIAL EQUITY OPERATORS. THE GOAL OF PROP SIXTY FOUR WAS TO TAKE CANNABIS PRODUCTION AND SALES OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE ILLEGAL MARKET USING THAT GUIDE POST TODAY. WILL ENSURE THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF THE CANNABIS TAX FUND AND THE CRITICAL PROGRAMS THAT RELY ON ITS FUNDING TOMORROW. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU SO MUCH SO NOW WE WILL HEAR FROM ADRIAN KEYS AS SMALL BUSINESS HOMESTEAD A SMALL HOME SAID CANNABIS FARMER FROM TRINITY COUNTY SO I SEE YOU ADRIAN. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY MY NAME IS ADRIAN KEYS I'M A LICENSED CULTIVATOR ENTRY COUNTY WHERE I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN LOCAL CANNABIS ADVOCACY FOR NEARLY SEVEN YEARS I'VE HELD A LOCAL LICENSE SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND UNDERSTANDING MEMBER AND PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF THE TREATY COUNTY AGRICULTURAL ST COUNTY'S PREMIER CANNABIS TREATISES THE ISSUE SINCE TWENTY NINETY I ALSO SERVED AS A REGIONAL CHAIR ON THE REGION'S COUNCIL. MY HOMESTEAD FARM HOLDS A TEN THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT OUTDOOR LICENSE WITH SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SQUARE FEET OF CANOPY I WORK WITH MY WIFE AND NO EMPLOYEES WE SUSTAINABLE REGENERATIVE PRACTICES TO GROW OUR OWN FOOD ALONG WITH CANDIDATES AND HAVE NO ABILITY TO FURTHER REDUCE COSTS. OUR LADY LARGEST FIXED COST IS LOCAL AND STATE LICENSING WITH THE CULTIVATION TAX BEING THE GREATEST COST OVERALL MY SMALL FARM ALONE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR GENERATING NEARLY THIRTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. A CULTIVATION TAX IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. HI INTO THIS MARK SEASON- WHOLESALE PRICE OF FALLEN TO NO MORE THAN FIFTY PER. OF LAST YEAR. MY ESTIMATE FOR RETURNS THIS YEAR WILL SHOW THE CULTIVATION TAX BEING. 3250% OF THE FARMGATE PRICE. AS PRICES CONTINUE TO FALL THE TAX BECOMES PROPORTIONATELY MORE IMPACTFUL. EFFECTIVELY ABSORBING ANY OF MY PROFIT MARGIN- THE TAX ON TRIM. ACTUALLY EXCEEDS ITS WHOLESALE PRICE BY AT LEAST A HUNDRED PERCENT. AND APPLYING THE FLAT RATE FLOWER TAX ON DIFFERENT GRADES OF FLOUR FROM THE SAME PLANT. ESSENTIALLY NULLIFIES THE VALUE OF SMALLER BUGS WHICH WOULD ENTER THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS A LESS EXPENSIVE MANUFACTURING GREAT. NO OTHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT IS TAXED AT PRODUCTION BEFORE IT'S EVEN SOLD. AND A FLAT RATE TAX ON WEIGHT AND COMMODITIES DRIVEN MARKET. ONLY ENCOURAGES IMPACTFUL INTENSIVE CULTIVATION METHODOLOGIES AND OVERSUPPLY IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE RATIO OF REGULATORY COSTA PRODUCTION VALUE. WHEN PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR PASSED. I WAS OPTIMISTIC AND HOPEFUL THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION WOULD. REALIZE THE GOALS EXPRESSED IN THE BILL. CAN WE INVITE. PROVIDING REASONABLE ACCESS OF REGULAR REGULATED CANNABIS TO CONSUMERS. AND TRANSITIONING THE LEGACY MEDICAL INDUSTRY INTO REGULATION. YOUR TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS ONE OF WHICH IS EXCESSIVE TAXATION AT THE FARM GATE I DO NOT FEEL THE GOALS OF PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR BEING REACHED. OVER THE LAST FEW QUARTERS OF TWENTY TWENTY RETAILS SALES AND THEIR ASSOCIATED TAXES DECLINED FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE LEGALIZATION. AND AFTER A TEPID RECOVERY IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. REVENUES CONTINUE TO FALL UP THE UNREGULATED MARKET IS IN NO WAY SHRINKING. AND IS STILL RESPONSIBLE 46270% OF ALL CANNABIS SOLD AND CONSUMED IN CALIFORNIA. AND ALL IF NOT MORE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF UNREGULATED CANNABIS ACTIVITIES CONTINUE. SMALL AND LEGACY EQUITY FARMS AND BUSINESSES ARE PARTICULARLY THREATENED BY MARKET CONSTRUCTION AT THE UNREGULATED MARKET. YOU TO OUR SMALL SIZE LACK OF ACCESS TO FINANCING THE COMPOUNDING TAXES. MANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA ARE TAKING THE LEAD IN INTRODUCING THREE. FROM DIEGO AND ONE IN THE SOUTHLAND. THE OAKLAND ST. AND HUMBOLDT IN THE NORTH. GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES ARE COLLABORATING TO FIND SOLUTIONS THAT ENHANCE THE LEGACY IN EQUITY BUSINESSES WHO HAVE MADE CALIFORNIA FAMOUS FOR ITS CRAFT CANNABIS. IT IS IMPERATIVE TO THE LONG TERM HEALTH OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY. TO BRING OUR LEGACY IN EQUITY CRAFT CULTIVATORS IN THE COUNTRY INTO THE WRLD. MONITISE CANNABIS CAN AND WILL BE PRODUCED AT A LOWER EXPENSE IN REGIONS WHERE LAND LABOR AND TAXES ARE CHEAPER. IT'S NO SECRET THE CALIFORNIA CRAFT CANNABIS IS WORLD CLASS AND HAS A BUILT IN GLOBAL DEMAND. AS WE STEADILY MOVED TOWARDS FEDERAL LEGALIZATION AND REGULATION. WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY WHEN WE CAN SHARE OUR WORK WITH THE WORLD. PLEASE SUPPORT OUR LIQUIDITY OUR LEGACY AND EQUITY CULTIVATORS AND THE IMPACT TO COMMUNITIES WHERE WE LIVE BY PERMANENTLY REMOVING THE KILL THE CULTIVATION TAX. WE ARE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS- THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND OUT ALL OF THE AVAILABLE THIRTY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU MISTER KEITH I LOVE THE PSA AT THE END. SO NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM NICK MADURO'S WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION I SEE YOU. ANY GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME. I'M NICK MAJERUS ON THE DIRECTOR OF CD TFA OR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. WE ADMINISTER THREE- STATE TAXES ON CANNABIS- SAID CHRISTINE MENTION TWO OF THEM THE CULTIVATION EXCISE TAX WHICH APPLIES ONLY TO CANNABIS. WE ALSO COLLECT THE SALES AND USE TAX WHICH APPLIES GENERALLY TO ALL SALES OF TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY IN THE STATE. INCLUDING CANNABIS. IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THESE THREE TAXES TOGETHER BROUGHT IN JUST SHY OF ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE- ALTHOUGH THAT FIGURE DOES INCLUDE LOCAL AND DISTRICT pCD TFA ADMINISTERS. ON BEHALF OF THIS- CITIES AND COUNTIES ALL ACROSS THE STATE. AS A GENERAL MATTER WE'RE FOCUSED ON ADMINISTERING OUR THIRTY EIGHT TAX AND FEE PROGRAMS UNDER OUR PURVIEW. LEAVING BROADER TAX POLICY QUESTIONS TO POLICY MAKERS AND OTHERS- CD TFA STANDS READY TO ADMINISTER THE TAX IS DETERMINED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND THAT TOGETHER WITH THE GOVERNOR- HOWEVER POLICYMAKERS SEE FIT. BUT AS YOU CONSIDER POSSIBLE REFORMS TO THE TAX STRUCTURE OF ADULT USE CANNABIS IN CALIFORNIA. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP TWO IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES IN MIND. FIRST TAXES SHOULD GENERALLY BE A SIMPLE AND EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE. IDEALLY THE TAX STRUCTURE SHOULD BE RELATIVELY EASY FOR US TO ADMINISTER. AND NOT OVERLY COMPLICATED FOR TAXPAYERS HEY NOW WE ALL KNOW THE TAXES ARE FREQUENTLY COMPLICATED. BUT CALIFORNIA'S CANNABIS TAX STRUCTURE CAN BE PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE. AND THAT COMPLEXITY IMPACTS OUR ADMINISTRATION OF THE TAXES AND AS YOU'VE HEARD FOR MANY OTHERS IT ADDS TO THE BURDEN FOR BUSINESSES. THAT ARE BEING RESPONSIVE. IN TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE TO ALL OF THE STATE RULES. SECOND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE TAX STRUCTURE IS FAIR TO THOSE BUSINESSES THAT ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO COMPLY. WE HAD CD TFA OFTEN HEAR FROM LEGAL CANNABIS BUSINESSES THAT THEY ARE BEING UNDERCUT BY THOSE OPERATING FREQUENTLY QUITE FLAGRANTLY OPERATING. OUTSIDE THE LEGAL MARKET. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM AND TO BRING FAIRNESS TO THE MARKET I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT A CONSIDERATION OF TAX CHANGES. ALSO INCLUDE ROBUST ENFORCEMENT MEASURES TO PREVENT ILLEGAL CANNABIS OPERATORS FROM EXPLOITING THEIR UNFAIR TAX ADVANTAGE EVEN IF THE TAXES WERE LOWER. IF SOME PEOPLE ARE PAYING IT AND SOME AREN'T THERE'S STILL A VERY SIGNIFICANT COST ADVANTAGE- TO OPERATING OUTSIDE LEGAL MARKET THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED. SO I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT. YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND SO OUR FINAL- PRESENTER IS NICOLE ELLIOTT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL. AND WE SEE YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. LET ME FIRST BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF FOR- YOUR WORKS YOU CAN MEET US ALL HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS. I ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES FOR OUR LICENSEES TAXES. MY NAME'S A CLIENT I HAVE THE DISTINCT HONOR OF SERVING AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE NEW REFORMS DEPARTMENT OF CAMPUS CONTROL. FROM THE OUTSET OUTSIDE LET ME ACKNOWLEDGE THE LIMITED NATURE OF THE DEPARTMENT'S ROLE IN COMMERCIAL CANNABIS TAXATION. WE DO NOT SET TAX RULES OR RATE STEPS UP TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE VOTERS. I AM WE DO NOT A MINISTER OR COLLECTS TAXES THAT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MY PEER DIRECTOR INTERESTED THE DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. HOWEVER HAVING SAID THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS UNIQUELY SITUATED TO SHARE WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM OUR LICENSEES. I IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE ADMINISTRATION ON TAX REFORM AND WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM LICENSEES AND CONSUMERS IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S TAX STRUCTURE PRESENTS SEVERAL CHALLENGES. THE MOST OBVIOUS BEING THAT THIS THE SENTIMENT THAT TAXES ARE JUST TOO HIGH. I'M HOWEVER LICENSEES ALSO SHARE WITH US HOW THE TAX STRUCTURE POSES SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES. SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN ALLUDED TO IN COMMENTS TODAY. I FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE TOLD THAT THE IMPOSITION OF A FIXED TAX RATE ON CULTIVATORS RATES TIED TO OVERALL INFLATION. DOES NOT APPROPRIATELY CONSIDER AGRICULTURAL MARKET FLUCTUATIONS THEREFORE THIS TAX POLICY HAS SHOWN TO UNEQUALLY BURDEN FARMERS. PARTICULARLY SMALL FARMERS AT A TIME WHEN MARKET CONDITIONS ARE MOST CHALLENGING. THE IMPOSITION OF MULTIPLE TAXES FOCUSED ON MULTIPLE POINTS IN A CANNABIS SUPPLY CHAIN. AS EVIDENCED IN THAT CANDY L. A. GRAPHIC MAKES THE SYSTEM I'M AN ASSIST. AND IT MINUTES BURDENSOME COMPLY OF THIS CAN MAKE IT CHALLENGING FOR OPERATORS TO TRACK TAXES OWED AND PAID RESULTING IN THE NEED FOR SOME TO EXPEND ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO REMAIN COMPLIANT. WE CAN THE CURRENT STRUCTURE IN WHICH BUSINESSES IN CASH BASED INDUSTRY WITHOUT READY ACCESS TO CAPITAL ARE ASKED TO PAY ESTIMATED TAXES IN ADVANCE AND SEEK REPAYMENT LATER. IS ESPECIALLY CHALLENGING FOR SMALLER OPERATORS WITH FEWER ECONOMIC RESOURCES PARTICULARLY SMALL OPERATORS AND EQUITY OPERATORS. CONSIDERING THE STRUGGLE SHARED BY LICENSEES WE CONCUR WITH WHAT APPEARS TO BE A SHARED SENTIMENT THAT TAX REFORM IS NEEDED TO KEEP THE AND MOVE OPERATORS AND CONSUMERS IN THE REGULATED MARKET. WE ARE JOINING THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN ONGOING CONVERSATIONS. WITH MEMBER OFFICES AND STAKEHOLDERS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR POSITIONS ON TAX REFORM POLICY. AND WE ARE CURRENTLY REVIEWING TAX REFORM PROPOSALS RECENTLY PUT FORWARD BY THE LEGISLATURE. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAS INDICATED THEY PLAN TO BRING THE STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE LEGISLATURE AND INDUSTRY TOGETHER TO HELP IDENTIFY A SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE TAX REFORM SOLUTION THAT PROVIDES RELIEF. TO THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY OF PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR WHICH PROMISED VOTERS REVENUE FOR USED PROGRAMS ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. AND ENFORCEMENT AGAINST THE ILLICIT MARKET. I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ALSO SHARE THAT CONCURRENT TO TAX REFORM CONVERSATIONS. THE DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL IS WORKING DILIGENTLY TO FIND WAYS TO REDUCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PARTICIPATING IN THE LEGAL MARKET. SINCE THE DEPARTMENT'S CREATION WE HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO BETTER SUPPORT LEGAL BUSINESSES FOR EXAMPLE WITHIN TWO MONTHS OF THE DEPARTMENTS CREATE ANY TEXT WEST ABSALOM EIGHT CONFLICTING REQUIRE MIGHT REQUIREMENTS STREAMLINE APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS AND INCORPORATE A PATHWAY FOR BUSINESSES. TO START UTILIZING TRADE SAMPLES THROUGH EMERGENCY REGULATIONS AND SINCE THEN WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS TO IDENTIFY HOW WE CAN FURTHER IMPROVE OUR REGULATIONS TO MAKE IT EASIER. AND LESS COSTLY FOR BUSINESSES TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE. WE ANTICIPATE TAKING A SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD ON REGULATORY IMPROVEMENTS VERY SOON HOWEVER THESE EFFORTS REFLECT INITIAL STEPS THERE IS SO MUCH OPPORTUNITY. IN CANNABIS REFINING INSTANCE STRENGTH IN THE FRAMEWORK IN WHICH WE COLLECTIVELY DO OUR WORK. SO THE DEPARTMENT WILL CONTINUE WORKING ON THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ON AN ONGOING BASIS THROUGH REGULAR ROLE MAKING SURE HAT WE ARE CONSTANTLY ADAPTING WITH THE INDUSTRY APPLYING BEST PRACTICES IN DOING OUR PART. TO FOSTER. DIVERSE IN ALL IN CLOSE THE COMMITTED TO DEVELOP OF CAMP TAX STABILIZE THE LEGAL MARKET AND DO WHAT AND THE END OF POLICIES THAT DO NOT NEEDLESSLY BURDEN CALIFORNIA'S LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY FOR THIS- FOR HIM TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION AND FOR INVITING ME TO PARTICIPATE I WILL REMAIN ON THE LINE FOR ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT NICOLE SO NOW I AM- FLY BY THE SEAT OF MY PANTS HERE BECAUSE I LEFT MY- SCRIPT UPSTAIRS BUT THAT'S OKAY. WE'RE NOW GOING TO OPEN IT UP TO QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AND I WANT TO REMIND- COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT WHEN YOU ASK YOUR QUESTION PLEASE TURN ON YOUR MIKE I ALSO WANT TO REMIND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT GREG MINOR WITH THE CITY OF OAKLAND IS GOING TO LEAVE AT THREE O'CLOCK AND SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS SPECIFICALLY FOR M. YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE GREAT TO ELEVATE THOSE FIRST. SO MISTER VICE CHAIR DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. LET JOURNALISTS HAD COMMENTED ABOUT HOW THE ACTION REVENUE WENT UP AND THEN LEVELED OFF- GOOD HE EXPLAINED. THE PHENOMENA WHAT HAPPENED. THE CARD THAT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER NIELSEN- I'M NOT SURE I MEAN I'M IN A POSITION AS MUCH AS I THINK FOLKS WHO ARE- TRACKING THE INDUSTRY IN MORE DETAIL AYE AYE I COULD ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT THE TRENDS LOOK LIKE BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT I'M IN A BETTER POSITION NECESSARILY THEN THE OTHER. PANELISTS TO- TO PROVIDE EXPLANATIONS FOR THE CAUSES- I WILL SAY WE HAD TO EXTRA JUST TO RECAP- INITIALLY THE FIRST QUARTER TO REVENUES THAT WERE- I THINK CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN PEOPLE AND HELPING TO SERVE A VERY SLOW START THERE. THEN A VERY HIGH GROWTH RATES FOR- A COUPLE YEARS AND IN PARTICULAR EVEN ACCELERATING IN CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY SORT OF DURING THE- FIRST. COUPLE QUARTERS OF THE PANDEMIC REALLY- VERY FAST GROWTH RATE AND THEN ESSENTIALLY AROUND. THE END OF TWENTY CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY AND- CONTINUING THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY ONE REALLY THAT THAT LEVELING OFF THAT YOU WERE. REFERRING TO YOU AS FAR AS THE INDUSTRY DYNAMICS UNDERLYING THAT I'M I'M AFRAID ALL HAVE TO A DEFERRED IT TO OTHER PANELISTS ON THAT. IT I MAY NOT CHAIRMAN I JUST THE QUESTIONS YEAH EVER OF THE IN. TO LIKE TO SPEAK YES I WAS GOING TO ASK IF SOMEONE FROM THE INDUSTRY WANTED TO ADDRESS IT OR EVEN NICK FROM CV FTA. YEAH PARENTS THIS WHAT'S THAT. HI GOOD AFTERNOON THANKS FOR THE QUESTION- I DID IT IS AN IMPORTANT ONE I'M A SPECULATION IS THAT BAD DRAMATIC INCREASE BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY- AND THE EARLY PART OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE A REALLYHAS TO DO WITH PANDEMIC SPENDING THAT THAT THAT THAT BUT WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO SEE A DRAMATIC REDUCTION BACK TO THAT TWENTY NINETEEN US LOST- I WAS I SORT OF THE REAL THE REAL MARKET THAT WE ARE SORT OF CONTENDING WITH RIGHT NOW BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THAT DRAMATIC INCREASE. REFLECTED IN THAT ARE AMAZING- VISUAL IT IS A REFLECTION OF PANDEMIC SPENDING IN THE FACT THAT WE WERE AFFORDED DURING THE PANDEMIC THE OPPORTUNITY TO ONCE THEY OPEN- AND TO- OPPORTUNITIES LIKE CURBSIDE DELIVERY ZERO TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS HAD. ADDITIONAL. ADDITIONAL SAFE ACCESS CHANNEL. OKAY GIVE ME TWO MORE QUICK FOR NOW A PROBLEM WILL HAVE MORE- WELL NOT MISTER SENATOR AT NICK DID YOU ALSO TO ADDRESS THAT. YES IF I MAY JUST BRIEFLY. IS YOU LOOK AT THE TOTAL REVENUE ACROSS THE THREE TAXES WE SAW PEAK IN SECOND QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- AND PART OF THE GROWTH INITIALLY IN THIS IS EARLIER THAN THAT CERTAINLY IS THAT ONCE WE HAVE ENOUGH DATA IN OUR SYSTEM FOR SALES THE- STATEWIDE AVERAGE RETAIL MARKUP MOVED FROM 60% THE ACTUAL MARKET. WHICH DID- RESULT IN A BOOSTING TAX REVENUE- THAT I THINK ALSO IS REFLECTED IN SOME OF THAT- SIGNIFICANT GROWTH. IF ANYONE WOULD BE WILLING TO COME AT A LOT OF TESTIMONY HERE ABOUT THE PLIGHT. OF THE PRODUCERS. AN THE BUSINESS PEOPLE. BUT NOT MUCH COMMENT ABOUT THE ILLEGAL MARKET THE- FISHKEEPING THESE TAXES SOME OF THE WITNESSES I'D APPRECIATE IF ANY OF THEM OR SOMEONE. WOULD COMMENT ON THEIR SUGGESTIONS AS TO HOW. THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR CAN ACT. TO CUT DOWN ON THE ILLEGAL MARKET OUT THERE DELEUZE'S SCRAPING IT SOUNDS LIKE ENORMOUS REVENUE. THEY'RE AVOIDING. ANY IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN DEAL WITH THAT MASSIVE PROBLEMS. LET'S HEAR AYE MR KEYES- I SEE YOUR HAND UP. THANK YOU I DON'T BELIEVE MINE WAS UP FIRST BUT IF IT'S A IF IT'S APPROPRIATE I'LL CONTINUE ON. I THINK THEY EXPANDED RETAIL ACCESS IS IT THERE'S A THE FUNCTIONALITY OF RETAIL ACCESS THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE WHO WOULD PARTICIPATE IN THE REGULATED MARKET DID YOU SELL AND IS THERE IS NO ACCESS- BROKE MOST OF THE INTERIOR OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THERE'S VERY LIMITED ACCESS. YEAH AGAIN THIS IS STILL BEING CONSUMED THERE AREN'T. SITE THAT'S NOT WOULD BE MY TAKE ON OF MY CULTIVATORS PERSPECTIVE I THINK THAT THERE WERE A LOT OF. A LOT OF ESTIMATES AND FORECASTS THEY WERE YOUR PROJECTIONS THAT CAME ABOUT TO DO AT THE ONSET OF SIXTY FOUR. AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF THESE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MANY OF WHOM VOTED NO THEIR POPULOUS VOTED TO APPROVE PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR. HAVE CHOSEN TO BATTLE ACTIVITIES AND- USE THE REGULATION AS AN ATTEMPT TO REINSTALL PROHIBITION THAT'S MY TAKE. I DON'T KNOW IF MISTER MINER OR MISS CENTER. AND I HOPE I'M USING CORRECT PRONOUNS IF YOU ALL WANTED TO MAYBE ADDRESS THE QUESTION. I DON'T KNOW OKAY I SEE. AMBER DO YOU WANT TO JUMP IN. ARE YOU CAN GO FIRST AND I'LL GO AFTER YOU AND I JUST NEED TO APOLOGIZE I DON'T SEE EVERYONE ON MY SCREEN SO I AM JUST CALLING ON THE PEOPLE THAT POP UP FIRST SO. IF THERE'S IF YOU ALL WANT TO BE RESPECTFUL OF EACH OTHER AND NEWSWORLD. YOU SURELY CAN BUT- I'LL TRY TO BE BRIEF SO I THINK REDUCING TAXES ON THE REGULATED MARKET WILL HELP- IT'S NOT GOING TO SOLVE EVERYTHING IN TERMS OF THE UNREGULATED MARKET BUT IT'LL THOSE CONSUMERS PURCHASING FROM THE RADIO I'M REGULATED MARKET TO PURCHASE THAT SAME OR INEQUIVALENT PRODUCT IN THE REGULATED MARKET WE HAD AN EXISTING MATTER YOU KNOW CONSUMER BASE THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN HAD TO PAY FOR MORE FOR THE SAME OR EQUIVALENT PRODUCT. AND NOT ALL OF THEM OR MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN TRANSITION TO THE REGULATED MARKET BEFORE ABLE TO REDUCE THE TAXES THE REGULATED MARKET MAYBE THAT WILL HELP ENCOURAGE SOME OF THESE CONSUMERS TO COME BACK- SO THAT'S THAT'S ONE SUGGESTION OBVIOUSLY ENFORCEMENT ON ITS OWN THERE'S A THERE'S A NEED FOR ENFORCEMENT BUT- ON ITS OWN I THINK IT'S A LITTLE. IT'S A- UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT CONSUMERS TO NOT TRANSITION TO THE REGULATED MARKET WITHOUT A REDUCTION IN TAX RATES THE END OF THE DAY THAT'S HOW WE ALL MAKE OUR DECISION A LOT OF OUR DECISIONS HOW WE SPEND OUR MONEY. REGARDLESS OF THE CONTEXT THAT'S- IT'S AN OPINION BASED ON YOU KNOW THE EXPERIENCE OF INTERACTING WITH OPERATORS HERE IN OAKLAND AND ALSO WITH SOME OF THE CHALLENGES IN IN TRYING TO ENFORCE OUR WAY. OUT OF A PROBLEM. GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU AND MISS CENTER DID YOU WANNA ALSO SHARE. YES SO AS SOME SMALL OPERATOR MYSELF THAT HAS TRANSITIONED OVER FROM LEGACY TO THE LEGAL MARKET- HE- YOU KNOW- IT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT- GOING TO THE LICENSING PROCESS IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE EASIEST THING TO DO SO. LOWERING THE BARRIERS OF ENTRY TO ACTUALLY BECOMING LICENSED- AS IS ONE WAY TO GET. MORE ILLICIT OPERATORS I TRANSITIONED OVER AS WELL AS- ECHOING GREG MINOR- LOWERING THE TAXES CURRENTLY THEY HAVE NO INCENTIVE TO PAY LOWER TAXES OR PAY ANY TAXES SO LOWERING THE TAXES- GETTING SOME OF THE CONSUMERS TO PURCHASE ON THE LEGAL MARKET AND THEN. HOPEFULLY ARE GETTING THE- UNREGULATED OPERATORS TO TRANSITION OVER- IT IS THE TOP BEHIND THAT AND THEN ALSO- ECHOING MR KEYS. ARE EXPANDING RETAIL ACCESS- AS- KAREN WATSON MENTIONED EARLIER ONLY 20% OF CALIFORNIA'S MARKET IS CURRENTLY ALLOWING COMMERCIAL CANNABIS ACTIVITY. WHERE BIG STATE- I BELIEVE 76% OF THE STATE VOTED FOR LEGALIZATION SO THAT NEEDS TO BE REFLECTED IN THE RETAIL MARKET AND IT'S JUST NOT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MR THE DRESS YOU HAVE YOUR HAND UP WITH THAT FROM BEFORE OR DID YOU WANT TO ADD TO THIS. NO I WOULD ADD JUST IN TERMS OF THE IF I MAY IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT I THINK THERE ARE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE ON THE TAX FRONT- TO PROVIDE STRONGER ENFORCEMENT- IN BRINGING THE CANNABIS TAX- RULES MORE IN LINE FOR INSTANCE WITH THE SALES AND USE TAX RULES THE STATE HAS WHICH- YOU KNOW MILLION TAXPAYERS ALREADY- ARE SUBJECT TO. MAKE MAKE IT EASIER TO ENFORCE- TAX LIABILITIES I WOULD JUST POINT OUT WHEN WE'RE EXHAUSTED HAS TO TAX RATES. BUT THE- THAT TOBACCO TAXES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CIGARETTE TAXES NOW TWO DOLLARS NINETY SEVEN CENTS PER PACK IT'S FOR OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS IS HIGHER THAN SIXTY PERCENT- SO WE DO HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN THE STATE IN. AND TAXES THAT ARE RELATIVELY HIGH WHERE WE DON'T SEE THE SAME LEVEL OF NON COMPLIANCE AND I DO THINK THAT THE HIGHER THE TAX ONLY. THE MORE IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE HAVE A TAX SYSTEM THAT MAKES SENSE AND THAT IS EASILY ADMINISTERED AND THAT HAS- SUFFICIENT ENFORCEMENT AND I THINK HERE- YOU KNOW- ALL OF THOSE THINGS COULD BE ADDED ON TO MAKE A TAX SYSTEM THAT WORKS BETTER FOR INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS AFTER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO DIVERSIFY MY LAST LAST QUESTION THE MANAGER. WITH THE MURDER OF. ENFORCEMENT EMPLOYEE ABIDING BY THE RULES. BY THE LOS ENORMOUS. UNDERTAKE WHAT DO YOU THINK COULD BE DONE TO ENSURE THE ENFORCEMENT. THE COLLECTION OF THE TAXES ON THOSE WHO ARE AVOIDING IT AND TO PUNISH THOSE THEIR AVOIDING. WELL I THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I THINK THEY'RE TWO AVENUES HERE ONE THERE THERE IS A CRIMINAL AVENUE CRIMINAL AVENUE OVER WHICH I DON'T HAVE ANY SAY IN THAT INVOLVES GETTING LOCAL PROSECUTORS AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERESTED IN- IN COMBATING THIS PROBLEM AND IN VARIOUS PORTIONS THE STATE THERE IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THAT INTEREST ON THE SEVERAL FRONT AS A TAX MATTER. I DO THINK WE'RE ALREADY DOING A LOT WE HAVE TEAMS AROUND THE STATE- WE CAN SEIZE PEOPLE'S PROPERTIES- PUT- SEIZE THEIR ASSETS- LEVY THEM- TAKE WHATEVER ASSETS WE CAN FIND TO SATISFY LAWFUL TAX OBLIGATIONS I DO THINK THAT THE WAY THE SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY SET UP- THERE ARE A FEW PROBLEMS THAT- MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO DO THAT THAN WE DO IN OTHER TAX AREAS AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT. IF WE BRING CANNABIS TAXES IN LINE WITH OUR OTHER TAX PROGRAMS LIKE SALES AND USE TAX THAT WE COULD DO AN EVEN BETTER JOB AT THAT IT IS AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM- AND IT WILL TAKE TIME BUT THE CIVIL PATH I BELIEVE- IS GOING TO BE A LOT MORE EFFECTIVE AND MORE EFFICIENT THAN TRYING TO PURSUE A CRIMINAL PAST. WHEN THE PROBLEM IS SO WIDESPREAD ROOM LAST WON AND FOR THE MOMENT MADAM CHAIR THE COMMITTEE GROSS THE YOUR SUGGESTION FOR SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE DONE DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA. ON ON HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS YOU HAVE SANCTIONED OR CONTACTED IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER- DIVIDE I'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH- INFORMATION ABOUT- HOW MANY ARE PRODUCTS SEIZURES WE'VE DONE HOW MUCH CASH HE SEES WE REGULARLY HAVE TEAMS AROUND THE STATE. AT THE RETAIL LEVEL THAT WILL GO IN AND SEIZE ON TAX PRODUCT THAT WILL- YOU KNOW WE'LL GO IN WITH LOCKSMITHS AND- TAKE THE CASH OUT OF THE SPACE- IN ORDER TO SATISFY TAX OBLIGATIONS. IT'S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH IT IS THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM IS VERY LARGE AND THAT'S WHY I'M SUGGESTING THAT I DO THINK THERE IS SOME SLIGHT MODIFICATIONS IN THE TAX CODE THAT WOULD. HELP US TO DO AN EVEN BETTER JOB AT THAT BUT- BUT THE OTHER ISSUE IS THAT WE REALLY NEED A STRONGER PARTNERSHIP WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AROUND THE STATE BECAUSE- YOU KNOW I HAVE AUDITORS- WHO AND IT'S- SENDING- AUDITORS INTO A- ILLEGAL CANNABIS OPERATION. WE YOU KNOW WE NEED HELP- AND WE NEED LAW ENFORCEMENT TO GO IN WITH US AND THAT'S PROVEN TO BE A CHALLENGE. I APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWERS BUT I CAN GET YOU THE DATA I'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH. THE DATA IN TERMS OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE IF YOU WOULD BE SO KIND I WOULD APPRECIATE IT. I JUST HAVE TO OBSERVE NOT WITH A SMILE BUT WITH A HUGE ROUND. WE'RE IN THE PROCESS IN THE STATE OF PRETTY MUCH DIMINISHING DESTROYING AND PUTTING THE HANDCUFFS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE'RE PAYING THE CONSEQUENCES. BUT I SEE NO ABILITY OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT NOW ANY LAWN FOR. THEY ARE LOCAL. TO BE ABLE TO DO ANYMORE AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE SUFFERING TODAY THAT IS JUST THE SENATORIAL OBSERVATION MANAGER THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR AND MISTER MAJORIS AT THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU GAVE ABOUT TOBACCO EVEN THOUGH THE- TAXES ARE HIGH ON THAT- THE DIFFERENCES THAT I DON'T THINK THERE'S A MARKET PLACE FOR ILLEGAL TOBACCO THAT'S BEING SOLD SO THE REAL ISSUE IS JUST THE COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE WITH REGARDS TO WHAT STATE IS OFFERING THE SAME PRODUCT FOR- WITH A LESS WITH THE- LOWER TAX. SO I DO THINK THERE'S- A DIFFERENCE BUT- MISS ELLIOTT YOU HAD YOUR HAND UP DID YOU WANT TO ADDRESS SOMETHING THAT SENATOR NIELSEN HAD ASKED. I DIDN'T WANT TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION IF I MAY UM TWO FIRSTS AT ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF THE DIRECTOR MADURO'S THAT THERE IS AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO STRENGTHEN. TAX POLICY ADD TO ENCOURAGE ACCOUNTABILITY- AND TO HOLD THOSE INDIVIDUALS OPERATING ILLEGALLY I COUNTABLE TO OUR TAX POLICIES- AND- ALSO THE DEPARTMENT IS WORKING. AT WITH OUR SWORN OFFICERS IN COLLABORATION WITH A NUMBER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE AS WELL AS STATE. LAW ENFORCEMENT AT TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST ILLEGAL MARKET HOWEVER I THINK IT GOES. OUT IT MUST BE SAID THAT HISTORICALLY WE HAVE SEEN THAT ENFORCEMENT DOES NOT GET RID OF THIS MARKET. ARE THERE HAVE TO BE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PATHWAYS- THAT WE TAKE TO ADDRESS THE ILLEGAL MARKET. AND IT REALLY A HUGE. DANCE WILL- WELL WILL MAKE A HUGE DENT IN THE ILLEGAL MARKET IS LOCAL PARTICIPATION AND TO THE POINT OF OPENING UP LOCAL ACCESS TO CONSUMERS CURRENTLY 62% OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BANNED ALL FORMS OF CANNABIS RETAIL. THAT INCENTIVIZES. AND PERPETUATES AN ILLEGAL MARKET BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS EXISTING CONSUMERS ARE THAT WILL PURCHASE CANNABIS WHETHER OR NOT IT'S FROM LEGAL OR ILLEGAL SOURCES. I SAW THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT- VERY OF ALL THAT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE LOST IN THE DISCUSSION- AND ALSO I WILL SAY I KNOW THAT- THE LEGISLATURE IS LOOKING AT A BUNCH OF OTHER CREATIVE SOLUTIONS IN THIS SPACE TO CREATE STABILITY IN THE MARKET. I'M THOSE ARE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE ARE ENCOURAGED TO SEE ARC ARE OCCURRING I MEAN LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW THOSE INVOLVED IN A SESSION. OKAY GREAT THANKS YEAH I JUST WANT TO SAY IF. YOU HAVE A TRUSTED SOURCE AND YOU CAN BUY CANNABIS FOR. FIVE DOLLARS OR TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. AND THEN THERE'S A LEGAL RETAILERS SELLING THE SAME THING FOR SEVENTY FIVE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PAY SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS. I MEAN. AS ANYWAY NO MORE COMMENTARY FOR ME SENATOR ROB I SEE YOUR- MICROPHONE IS ON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SINCE OF THE SUBJECTS TAX REFORM I WAS JUST TRYING TO REFRESH MY RECOLLECTION TO THE EXTENT I EVER HAD ANY. ON HOW WE GOT TO WHERE WE ARE WITH RESPECT TO THE- TAX SYSTEM FOR CANNABIS. SOMEONE MENTIONED ALCOHOL PREP SOMEONE COULD HIGHLIGHT FOR ME THE DIFFERENCES IF THERE ARE ANY BETWEEN. CANNABIS AND ALCOHOL WITH RESPECT TO THE TAX SCHEME IN THE COLLECTION SCHEME. EL AL'S OFFICE I SEE YOUR HAND IS THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR YES SO- STILL THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES- BETWEEN CANNABIS TAXATION AND ALCOHOL TAXATION IN CALIFORNIA AND JUST- SORT OF AT A HIGH LEVEL THERE ARE SIX THREE RELEVANT- BUT LEAST THREE RELEVANT LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT THAT ENGAGING. IN TAXATION THERE'S FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL- SO FOR ALCOHOL FEDERAL TAXES ARE VERY SUBSTANTIAL PARTICULARLY FOR DISTILLED SPIRITS- OF COURSE THERE IS NO FEDERAL EXCISE TAX ON CANNABIS BECAUSE OF FEDERAL PROHIBITION WHICH COULD BE THOUGHT OF AS AS AN EXTREME TAX OF SORTS. ON THERE ARE STATE EXCISE TAXES ON BOTH CANNABIS AND ALCOHOL- AND THEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THERE'S TO MY KNOWLEDGE NO SUCH THING AS A LOCAL ALCOHOL TAX AT LEAST IN CALIFORNIA BUT THERE ARE AS NOTED EARLIER SOME VERY SUBSTANTIAL LOCAL TAXES ON CANNABIS TO THE TUNE OF. AS WE ESTIMATED IN TWENTY NINETEEN APPROXIMATELY THE EQUIVALENT OF RETAIL PRICE. SO THEN AT THE STATE LEVEL- EARLIER I JUST TO RECAP THE EARLIER DESCRIPTION OF- CANNABIS TAXES STATEWIDE CANNABIS TAXES THERE'S THE PER POUND OR PER OUNCE CULTIVATION TAXES WELL AS THE A RETAIL EXCISE TAX WHICH IS A PERCENTAGE OF- IN MOST CASES THE WHOLESALE PRICE IN A FACT BUT IN SOME CASES OF THE- RETAIL PRICE. THEN ON THE ALCOHOL TAX SIDE OF THE STATE TAXES OR ESSENTIALLY ON THE- ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE BASED. ON DOLLARS- VOLUME OF THE BEVERAGE- THE FEDERAL EXCISE TAXES ON ALCOHOL ARE A BIT DIFFERENT. AND A BIT MORE COMPLEX AND IN SOME CASES YOU DEPEND ON ON THE ALCOHOL. CONTENT SPECIFICALLY- IN OUR TWENTY NINETEEN- REPORT- THAT I REFERENCED EARLIER WE ALSO HAD A COUPLE ACCOMPANYING LITTLE BLOG POSTS ONE OF WHICH ATTEMPTED A COMPARISON BETWEEN CANNABIS TAXES IN ALCOHOL TAXES- COMBINING EXCISE TAXES AT ALL FOR ALL THREE LAYERS OF GOVERNMENT COMBINED FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL. OF COURSE THIS OMITS OTHER OTHER FACTORS- PARTICULARLY RELATED TO THE FEDERAL PROHIBITION OF CANNABIS BY COMPARING JUST THE EXCISE TAXES- WHAT WE ESTIMATED WAS THAT- IN CALIFORNIA THE COMBINED- TAX TAXES ON- CANNABIS ARE. SHOWROOM NINE DESERVE COMBINED EXCISE TAX BURDEN IS YOUNG CANNABIS IS SORT OF SIMILAR TO- DISTILLED SPIRITS- BUT CERTAINLY CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN WHINER BEER. SO IN LOOKING AT YOUR FLOW CHART ON PAGE FOUR WHICH IS PAGE FOUR OF OUR HAND- YOU HAD A SLIDE- WITH RESPECT TO CANNABIS WE HAVE THE RETAIL EXCISE TAX WHICH IN AND OF ITSELF IS SORT OF CONFUSING TO ME BECAUSE AT ONE POINT IT'S DESCRIBED AS AN AD VALOREM TAX ON WHOLESALE SALES IN SOMEWHERE ELSE AND START IT'S DESCRIBED AS A FIFTEEN PERCENT. TAX ON THE RETAIL PRICE. OF THE PROPOSITION TALKS ABOUT A TAX ON RETAIL GROSS RECEIPTS. YES THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT DISTRIBUTORS HAVING TO COLLECT. HAVING TO ESTIMATE AND THEN PAY CAN YOU SORT OF. REVIEW THAT WITH ME YES PLEASE AND I BELIEVE DIRECTOR INTERESTS WILL HAVE A FOLLOW UP AFTER AFTER I RESPOND- SO V. MEASURE PROP SIXTY FOUR ESTABLISHED A- THAT- THE 15% EXCISE TAX ON RETAIL SALES AS WELL AS THE CULTIVATION TAX I AND THAT SORT OF AS FAR AS IT WENT IT WAS THESE TAXES AS ESTABLISHED IN PROP SIXTY FOUR WERE NOT. RADICALLY DIFFERENT AND INFORM FROM- FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW SOME OTHER TAXES THAT THE STATE ADMINISTERS ALTHOUGH AS SOME PANELISTS OF NOTI HAVING A CULTIVATION TAX PER SE ON AN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT IS NOVEL AT. THE STATE LEVEL I'M- BUT NINE FOUR OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN- IS WHAT INSTITUTED THIS- COLLECTION AND REMITTANCE AT THE DISTRIBUTOR LEVEL AND SO THAT'S SORT OF WHAT WHAT ALTERNATELY GAVE US THE SYSTEM- WHERE DISTRIBUTED THE FINAL DISTRIBUTOR OF THE CANNABIS PRODUCT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REMITTING THE TAX TO THE STATE- BUT TO SORT OF WORK THAT INTO A SYSTEM THAT HAD. A CULTIVATION TAX IN A RETAIL EXCISE TAX IT NECESSITATED SOME WORKAROUNDS AND ONE OF THEM WAS TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO COLLECT THE TAX- THE RETAIL EXCISE TAX BEFORE THE RETAIL SALE EVER BERZINS THAT'S SORT OF REFLECTED ON THE FLOW CHART IN THE HANDOUT AND I SUPPOSE. DIRECTOR MENTOR US I DON'T KNOW IF WE WANT TO GO TO HAMMER WELL I JUST AS WHY WAS WHY NOT HAVE THERE IF IT'S IF IT'S A TAX BASED ON RETAIL SALES. WHY NOT HAVE THE TAX COLLECTED AT THE POINT OF SALE. AND. THEN REMANDED EITHER DIRECTLY. TO CD T. OR IF THERE'S ROUTED THROUGH THE DISTRIBUTOR HAVEN'T ROUTED THROUGH THE DISTRIBUTOR. SO NOBODY'S FLOATING ANY MONEY. WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE TAX IS SUPPOSED TO BE. AND ISN'T THAT A SIMPLER PROCESS. YES OKAY. WELL I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO REVISIT THE- SO THERE IS NO PARTICULAR LEGAL REASON WHY IT WAS STRUCTURED THE WAY IT WAS STRUCTURED IT'S JUST BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE MAKE THE SAUSAGE HERE. WELL I AM SURE I THINK THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE OTHER PANELIST WITH THE DIFFERENT- PERSPECTIVE BUT- CERTAINLY WE WERE IN OUR TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT WE DISCUSSED SOME OF THE PROS AND CONS OF AND STRUCTURING IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS BUT ULTIMATELY- BONTA D. AS SORT OF SIMPLER PERCHES LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DISCUSSING ULTIMATELY. MEETS AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE DISTRIBUTORS BE TAKEN OUT OF THE PROCESS I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A BETTER WAY TO CALCULATE THE TAXES ULTIMATELY REMITTED. THERE MUST BE SOME GOING BACK AND FORTH IF SOMEBODY'S ESTIMATING AND THEN THERE'S AN ACTUAL RETAIL SALE AT SOME POINT YOU MUST HAVE TO TRUE UP THE PROCESS. IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT. WELL I THINK ANYWAY SAID MINIMUM PROBABLY SHOULD GET OTHER PANELISTS BUT JUST. THE WAY THEY LAW THE STATUTE IS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED IT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT TO BE TRUE IT UP BECAUSE IT'S ESSENTIALLY ONLY TRYING TO APPROXIMATE THE 15% IN AND IN AGGREGATE. NOT WITH RESPECT TO EVERY INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTION OKAY AND THEN ONE FOR ONE FINAL QUESTION I GUESS. ON THE CULTIVATION TAX IF I'M LOOKING AT YOUR FLOW CHART. DOES THE DOES THE TAX TO THE PROCEEDS ACTUALLY FLOW TO THE FIRST DISTRIBUTOR AND THEN TO THE MANUFACTURER AND DOWN TO THE LAST DISTRIBUTOR AND FINALLY TO. CD TFA. OR IS THAT JUST OF- FOR PURPOSES BILLS. AND IF THE ANSWER IS YES. THEN WHY ISN'T THE TAX PAYMENT FLOWING DIRECTLY TO THE FIRST DISTRIBUTOR FOR USING THE DISTRIBUTOR MODEL. OR TWO CD TFA SO- AGAIN BE INTERESTED IN HEARING FROM THE- OTHER OTHER PANELISTS BUT ALL ALL JUST SORT OF LAID OFF WITH THAT BECAUSE I'M EXPLAINING ARE FLOW CHARTS SO MY AGE IT'S NOT INTENDED TO BE A METAPHOR- YOU WE REALLY ARE UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE IS THERE IS AT LEAST IN PRINCIPLE ARE PAYMENTS FLOWING IN THAT FASHION OF COURSE AND THERE'S A LOT OF US WRITING DIVERSITY IN WHAT CANNABIS AT TAX SUPER SORRY WHAT CANNABIS SUPPLY CHAINS LOOK LIKE SO THAT'S- AYE IN THAT SENSE IT IS MERELY AN EXAMPLE ALTHOUGH WE TRY TO CHOOSE A VERY. COMMON WHAT WE UNDERSTAND IS A VERY COMMON STRUCTURE- OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THE STATUTE REQUIRES THE FINAL DISTRIBUTION TO BE THAT THE POINT OF TAX REMAINS EVEN FOR THE CANNABIS CULTIVATION TAX BUT I'M SURE OTHER FOLKS COULD AT AND THAT'S WHY WE ILLUSTRATED THAT WAY BUT OTHER FOLKS GOOD AT WHAT JUMP AND I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE IN THE SECOND FOR. ALL BUT IT'S THE STATURE NOT THE PROPOSITION THAT REQUIRES THAT SO WE'VE YES THAT'S MY UNDERSTAND THAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THIS THIS THIS WHOLE ALL OF THAT- ARISES FROM SB NINETY FOUR AS I UNDERSTAND AND I'LL THROW OUT ONE FINAL. QUESTION AND I'M- PERFECTLY. WILLING TO. MOVE AND LEAVE YOU WILL I BY YOU ENOUGH BUT- DO WE- EXPERIENCE ANY TAX WRECKAGE AS OPPOSED AS A RESULT OF THIS FLOW CHART WHERE THE MONEY FLOWS AROUND BEFORE IT ACTUALLY GETS TO THE- CD TFA. I THINK THAT'S ONE WHERE I WILL INDEED HAVE TO DEFER TO THE OTHER- PANELIST WE DON'T HAVE ANY HARD DATA ON THAT WE- IT SEEMS IN PRINCIPLE LIKE A SNIFF AGAIN- COMPLIANCE PROBLEM BUT OR I. I SHOULD SAY A SIGNIFICANT COMPLIANCE CHALLENGE THAT YOU KNOW THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT CAUSES AN ULTIMATE PROBLEM IS NOT SOMETHING WE HAVE HARD DATA ON A NON. SO DEFERRED ANY OTHER PANELISTS ON THAT ONE WELL IF THIS WERE THE PLUMBING IN MY HOUSE I HAVE A LEAK SOMEWHERE. AS USUAL YOU'VE BEEN GREAT SIR- I DON'T KNOW IF CD TFA WANTS TO WELL ACTUALLY WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO'VE. HAD THEIR HAND UP TO HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THE QUESTION THANK YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE ON FINISHED YEAH NO NO SO MISS CENTER AND THEN MISS WHAT'S AND. AND THEN WILL END WITH DIRECTOR MADURO'S. I YES THANK YOU I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY- THERE'S A SENSUALLY A HIT IN FEDERAL TAX- WHICH IS THE TWO EIGHTY E. R. AND IRS TAX CODE WHICH- PROHIBITS- US AS A CANNABIS- BUSINESS OPERATORS FROM- WRITING OR DEDUCTING- TYPICAL BUSINESS EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF CANNABIS SO ESSENTIALLY- A HIT IN FEDERAL TAX THAT WE PAY. THANK YOU LESS THAN ONE CENT YEAH THANK YOU- I DO APPRECIATE SENATOR ROSS I'VE QUESTIONS OF THE RABBIT HOLE WE'RE GOING DOWN CANNABIS TAXES ARE ABSOLUTELY CONFUSING BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE RUN DOWN THESE CHANNELS TO GET TO A POINT OF CLARITY I'M REGARDING THE ALIGNMENT OF CANNABIS TAXES AND THE AND THE ALCOHOL TRADE- YOU KNOW WHEREVER THE COMMITTEE DECIDES TO GO OR WHEREVER ALTERNATELY ME AND I IF WE CHOOSE TO KEEP THE COLLECTION IN REMISSION. IN THE DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL THEN YOU KNOW I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION OF ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS THAT ARE AFFORDED TO THE ALCOHOL TRADE THAT WE ARE NOT AFFORDED FOR INSTANCE A CREDIT LAW TO PROTECT THE FLOW OF GOODS TO RETAILERS WHO ARE YOU KNOW CHORE OR EXCUSE ME TO RESTRICT THE FLOW OF GOODS TO RETAILERS WHO ARE IN THE FALL RIGHT IF YOU DON'T PAY YOUR BILLS IN IN THE ALCOHOL MARKET YOU DON'T GET. ALCOHOL THE SUSPENSION OF THE OF LIFE. IF IS A SIX. TO FALL OUT FROM RITA BY UPON WHEN THE RETAILER DOES THE FALL LIKE AT THE END YOU KNOW AT THE VERY LEAST- YOU KNOW CANNABIS DISTRIBUTORS SHOULDN'T SHOULD NOT BE OBLIGED. TO REMIT ANOTHER OPERATORS TAX UNTIL THAT TAXES BEING COLLECTED. AND SO I'LL JUST AND THERE BUT IF WE'RE LOOKING FOR SEEKING TO KEEP THIS IN THE JUSTARSENAL I REALLY WHAT EMPLOYERS ARE- I BELIEVE AYE KRISTIN HOW TO UNLOCK AT TEAMSTERS. ALSO SUPPORTED SOME SOME WAYS TO PROTECT DISTRIBUTORS- AND ENSURE THAT THAT WE CAN REMIT THESE. TIMELY WITHOUT PUTTING A DOLLARS THANK YOU THE SENATORS INTEREST WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE WITH RESPECT TO ALCOHOL THE COMPUTATION OF THE TAXES CERTAIN AT THE TIME. THAT THE PRODUCT FLOWS FROM THE DISTRIBUTOR TO THE RETAILER. BUT NOT SO WITH RESPECT TO. CANNABIS IN CAREER. THIS WOULD SEND. THAT'S WHAT I MEAN THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING WE IN THE IN IN THE IN THE ALCOHOL INDUSTRY MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE BURDEN IS WHEN IT'S PRODUCED IN OUR THANKS BYE WE OFTEN DON'T WE DON'T GET WE DON'T COLLECT FROM THE RETAILER WE'RE WE'RE HAVING TO PAY. CITIES THE FAA BEFORE WE'VE ACTUALLY COLLECTS ABOUT REVENUE FROM THE RETAILERS BEFORE THAT PRODUCT HAS LEFT THE SHELLS AND THE REASON I MEAN I THINK WHERE WHERE WHAT WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH HERE IS THAT TAXES IN CALLAHAN COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA CANNABIS ARE DO YOU. LEGALLY WHEN THE PRODUCT ENTERS SUPPLIES CHANNEL AND THAT IS THE POINT AT WHICH- THE FINAL DISTRIBUTOR CAN DOCKS. QAQC SO. ALL OF THAT THE PAYMENT IS DUE AND SORT OF THAT THAT THE STATE DEEMS THAT PRODUCT HAVING BEEN SOLD. OUT THE POINT OF DISTRIBUTION BEFORE IT ACTUALLY GETS SOLD FROM THE STOP. WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE I MEAN IT SOUNDS LIKE WHEN THE RETAILER. REQUIRES THE PRODUCT FROM THE DISTRIBUTOR AT THE WHOLESALE PRICE THE WHOLESALE PRICE ALSO INCLUDES. AN EXCESS TASTE BETTER ACCESS TO TAX COMPONENT THAT'S BASED ON VOLUME APPARENTLY THAT IS THEN REMITTED TO THE STATE. THE RETAILER TAKES THE PRODUCT AND THEN SELLS IT OFF THE SHELF AND WHATEVER ELSE IS DUE IT'S DO WHICH IS NOT. THE CASE WITH CANNABIS WHERE WE'RE MAKING AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT THE RETAIL SALES PRICE WOULD BE. THE WHOLESALER THE DISTRIBUTOR PAYS THE ESTIMATE AND THEN I GUESS THE RETAILERS IN THE PROCESS AND YOU DEPEND ON COLLECTING THAT MONEY FROM THE RETAILER AT SOME POINT ONCE THE PRODUCT MOVES OFF THE RETAILER'S SHELF IS IN MY IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE WAY THIS PROCESS WORKS CORRECT YOU'RE ON YOUR ON THE RIGHT PATH AND THAT THAT COMPLAINT I THINK THE DIFFICULT PART. IS THAT IS THAT OFTEN TIMES THE PRODUCT THAT LEAVING THAT'S LEAVING THE SHOP DOESN'T SELL AT THAT 80% MARK OUT. WOW OKAY WELL YES- SO I GUESS I GIVE UP. NO NO YOU CAN'T GIVE UP BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A LOT IS GOING TO ADD AND THEN I'M SAVING YOU FOR LAST DIRECTOR MADURO'S BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A HAPPENED SADIO COMING RIGHT TO YOU. I FORGOT TO. THANK YOU SO MUCH I JUST WANTED TO ADDRESS- SOMEONE'S CENTER ROCKS CONCERNS THE TEAMSTERS IT'S REALLY NO SECRET THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE DEFINITELY THE FOLKS IN THE ROOM THAT ARE ASKING THAT THE TAXES- ST AT THE DISTRIBUTOR THERE'S A NUMBER OF REASONS. WHY WE FEEL THAT WAY- REALLY WHEN WE STARTED DOWN THIS PATH. WE ARE TAKING A AND PULLING IT UP INTO. A TRANSPARENT MARKETPLACE AND THE DISTRIBUTORS ROLE- AND THE SIXERS IN ALCOHOL AND- YOU KNOW IT IT WAS. DO YOU THAT THIS WOULD SERVICE AT A CHECK AND BALANCE- I AGREE WITH KAREN WHOLEHEARTEDLY THAT I THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE TEETH TO PROTECT YOUR DISTRIBUTORS- AND THEN IF THEY HAVE THOSE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE THEN THERE ARE. YOU KNOW THERE. WOULDN'T REALLY BE- YOU AT LEAST HAVE I KNOW. TO DIRTY WERE BACK YOU KNOW GETTING WORD KIND OF LEANING TOWARDS A SPACE WHERE YOU KNOW. WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO- REWARD THE GOOD ACTORS AND- I TAKE OUT THE FOLKS WHO. WE'RE NOT REMITTING THE TAX SO. IF WE HAVE DISTRIBUTORS WHO ARE HAVING ISSUES ACTUALLY COLLECTING AND RECEIVING THE TAX. BUT MY NEXT QUESTION IS HOW ARE WE THEN GOING TO TRUST THOSE SAME VENDORS THE SAME RETAILERS. REMITTING THE TAX THE STATE. TO DO THIS AT THE DISTRIBUTOR LEVEL THEN WHY WOULDN'T. HE EXPECTS THE EXCISE TAX BE BASED ON. THE WAIT FOR EXAMPLE OF THE CANNABIS IF THAT'S THE PROPER WAY TO DO IT IF WE'RE DOING ALCOHOL BY BY VOLUME. AND THEN HAVE THE RETAILER PAY THAT- TO THE DISTRIBUTOR HAVE THAT TAX REMITTED TO. CD TFA AND THE RETAILER TAKE THE PRODUCT AND MOVE IT OFF THE RETAILER'S SHELF WERE NOT. WOULD THAT BE A MORE CERTAIN WAY TO DO THIS AND THEN RETAILERS ABLE TO SELL THE PRODUCT WHATEVER THE RETAILERS ABLE TO SELL THE PRODUCT IF IT'S- THE IN OTHER WORDS TO TRY TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT. A CLOSER TO THE ALCOHOL MODEL IF WE'RE GOING TO USE THE ALCOHOL MODEL OF. DISTRIBUTION AS THE AS THE WAY TO GO FOR CANNABIS. I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY REFERRING TO POTENCY BASE MAY BECAUSE WE DO HAVE TO WAIT BASS ALTHOUGH I WILL NOT CLAIM AT ALL TO BE A TAX EXPERT I WILL LEAVE THAT TO- DIRECTOR MADURO'S- BUT- I JUST WANTED TO. ADDRESS SOME OF YOUR CONCERNS AND ALSO- ECHO WHAT WHAT KAREN WAS SAYING FROM CUBA THAT- BEFORE WE DISMANTLE. OF THE DISTRIBUTION PIECE WE THINK THAT THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAT THAT COULD BE ADDED BEFORE WE DO THAT AND ONE OF THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE WOULD BE PROTECTIONS FOR YOUR DISTRIBUTORS. AND THEN WHY NOT HAVE THE CULTIVATION TAX PAID. PERHAPS THROUGH THE FIRST DISTRIBUTOR THAT'S FINE BUT THEN DIRECTLY TO CD TFA. IF IT'S A CULTIVATION TAX I DON'T KNOW WHAT. IT'D VALUE. WHAT VALUE WOULD BE ADDED TO THE PRODUCT MOVING THROUGH MANUFACTURING AND THE OTHER DISTRIBUTORS IF IT'S A CULTIVATION TAX AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING ELSE. THOSE ARE GOOD QUESTIONS I WISH I HAD A GREAT ANSWER FOR YOU. WELL I DON'T KNOW EITHER BUT I DO APPRECIATE YOU PUTTING UP WITH ME THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR RUSSELL- MISS WATSON'S HAND JUST CAME OUT BUT- ERECTOR MADURO'S DO YOU. HAVE I YOUR HAND HAS BEEN UP FOR A MINUTE AND IT SOUNDS LIKE. YOU KNOW THE RENT IS TOO HIGH AND THE CANNABIS TAXES ARE TOO HIGH. I DON'T SET THE RATES BUT- I WOULD JUST SAY THAT SENATE ROTH HAS- IDENTIFIED. VERY QUICKLY AND- SOME OF THE KEY PROBLEMS THAT EXIST IN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CURRENT TAX SCHEME AND IF I COULD JUST TAKE A MINUTE ON THE ON THE CULTIVATION TAX PIECE IF THE CULTIVATION TAX WORD REMAIN. HAVING IT PAID BY THE FIRST DISTRIBUTOR FOR THE FOR THE OF THE FIRST PURCHASER ABSOLUTELY MAKES SENSE THAT THE ADDED COMPLEXITY OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT- YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST- CANNABIS FLOWER THAT IS BOUGHT AND THEN DIVVIED UP AND SOLD IT IS- YOU KNOW. MADE INTO EXTRACT WHICH IS THEN PASSED ALONG TO SOMEBODY ELSE WHO MAKES IT INTO IT. CANDY OR CHOCOLATE- OR INTO SOME SORT OF VAPE POD IN. AND TO TRY TO TRACK THAT IS JUST IS VERY DIFFICULT. I'M AND I DO THINK IT MAKES IT MUCH EASIER FOR THERE TO BE TAX LEAKAGE- ALTHOUGH I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW BY AND LARGE WE SEE THE- MOST PEOPLE IN THE LEGAL MARKET ARE TRYING THEIR BEST TO COMPLY BUT IT IS VERY COMPLICATED FOR THEM AND FOR US TO ADMINISTER. AND THEN- AT AT THE SALES POINT. THE YOU KNOW THE PROP 6415% RATE WAS SOMETHING THAT I THINK PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND IT WOULD BE LIKE A 15% EXTRA SALES TAX. I THINK THE CURRENT SYSTEM WITH THE AVERAGE STATEWIDE MARKUP- IS CONFUSING FOR INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS FOR CUSTOMERS AND IT MAKES IT- MORE DIFFICULT TO- ADMINISTER WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT THERE'S NOT A VERY REASONABLE- ROLE FOR. DISTRIBUTORS TO PLAY IN THE SYSTEM- CERTAINLY THERE'S TESTING THERE YOU KNOW COULD BE SOME OF THESE TAX FUNCTIONS AS WELL BUT- I THINK IF. BEFORE WE THROW UP OUR HANDS AND SAY THAT YOU HAVE. THE TAX SYSTEM. CAN'T WORK I WOULD JUST HOPE THAT- WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT AND TAKING SOME VERY COMMONSENSE SIMPLIFICATION MEASURES ON THE SENATE ROTH. AND MANY OTHERS HAVE IDENTIFIED. THANK YOU SENATE ARRESTED YOU HAVE ANY OTHER ALTHOUGH I'M FINISHED THANK YOU OKAY. SO CENTER TO COVER YOUR OWN DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. LET ME JUST SAY THAT- I DID NOT TAKE. TAX IN LAW SCHOOL FOR A REASON AND I HAD A WHOLE BUNCH OF QUESTIONS THAT WOULD HAVE MADE A MESS OF THIS AND SENATOR UP WENT RIGHT TO THE TO THE ISSUES THAT I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT PART OF THIS IS THAT PROPOSITION WHICH REQUIRES US TO GO BACK OUT TO THE VOTERS IN ORDER TO CHANGE IT. PART OF THIS IS ARE DOING AND THEN UNDERSTANDING WHERE WE TAX IT AND HOW IT'S DIFFERENT FROM OTHER TAXES SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO MAKE IT SIMPLER I'M I'M ALL FOR DOING THAT SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED- AND I DON'T HAVE IT IT CLEARED IN MY MIND. WHAT THE WORK THAT WE HAVE TO DO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT PARTICIPANTS THAT ARE HERE BECAUSE YOUR TESTIMONY IS. REALLY HELP KIND OF GET THROUGH- REALLY. I THINK. OUTLINED THE SAUSAGE MAKING RIGHT THAT THIS WAS A DIFFICULT TASK TO GET TO LEGALIZATION AND CONVINCING THE PUBLIC THAT WE HAD- SOME REAL IMPORTANT. OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE NEEDED TO EXPLOIT THAT IS WAS WAS I THINK PRINCIPLE AND SO NOW WE'VE GOT A WITH SOME EXPERIENCE WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE- THE- THE LEGAL MARKET. VERY COMPETITIVE SO THAT WE CAN GET RID OF THE ILLEGAL MARKET- AND THAT'S HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THERE SO I REALLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION TODAY. THANK YOU FOR THAT SERVER CABALLERO YEAH I JUST WANT TO ADD BEFORE WE GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT THAT. THE THE GRAPHIC. PROVIDED BY L. A. O. I MEAN THIS IS UNWIELDY- AND THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT WHAT YOU'RE pPEOPLE JUST HAVE THEIR HAIR GET BLOWN BACK BY LOOKING AT THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS PARTICULAR SYSTEM I WANT TO ECHO WHAT SENATOR CABALLERO SAID. YOU KNOW PRICING HAS TO BE COMPETITIVE IN ORDER TO DRY UP THE ILLEGAL MARKET- AND INSTEAD IT SEEMS LIKE WE'VE BEEN PENALIZING THOSE WHO'VE BEEN COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO ENTER INTO THE LEGAL MARKET WHO ARE NOT CONNECTED REALLY TO CORPORATE CAPITAL THAT CAN AFFORD TO SORT OF FLOAT THEM AND COVER THE COST OF ALL THE OBSTACLES IN THE CHALLENGES AND THE DELAYS- THAT ARE FACED IN THIS FIELD. AND THEN IT ALSO SEEMSLIKE WE KIND OF STRUCTURE TO TAX FORMULA BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THIS NEW LEGAL MARKET WAS GOING TO BE A CASH COW. AND HOW DO WE THEN SORT OF REVAMP IT IN A WAY THAT LOWERS OUR EXPECTATIONS SO THAT WE CAN. YOU KNOW PROMOTE AND ENCOURAGE GREATER GAME YOU KNOW IN THE MARKET PLACE- I HAD A QUESTION. BASED ON. THE GRAPHIC IN OUR HAND OUT ON PAGE NINE ABOUT THE CANNABIS TAXES ALLOCATION THREE SO IF THE CANNABIS TAX REVENUE DECLINES HOW WOULD THE PROGRAMS SPECIFICALLY THOSE THAT ARE IN THE ALLOCATION THREE HOW WOULD THEY BE IMPACTED IF AT ALL. A SERVICE- SENATOR COME WATER I CAN- I CAN SCAN YOU GIVE YOU A ROUGH SENSE- SAID KIRSTEN WITH THE L. S. STARRETT FORGET TO REINTRODUCE MYSELF- SO. THE WAY WE MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE OF THE WAY THAT- THE REVENUE IS ALLOCATED CURRENTLY IS THAT THERE IS A- LAG SPECIFICALLY FOR ALLOCATION THREE WHERE. I'M SO TYPICALLY FOR MOST FUNDS IN THE STATE BUDGET I YOU TRY TO ALIGN THE SPENDING AND REVENUE- SIMULTANEOUSLY IN THE SAME YEAR. BUDGET HERE FOR EXAMPLE ARE PREFERRED ALLOCATIONS THREE- IN CANNABIS TAXES IT'S A BIT DIFFERENT IT'S A YEAR DELAY I'M AWARE THERE'S A BALANCE FROM THE PRIOR TO OF TAX REVENUES FROM THE PRIOR YEAR THAT THEN GETS CARRIED OVER YOU SEE HOW MUCH YOU HAVE. AND YOU DIVIDE THAT UP AMONG THE AB- DENTIST HERE THREE- ALLOCATIONS- AND SO FOR A LEGISLATURE WERE TO TAKE AN ACTION THAT AFFECTED REVENUE STARTING JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THAT WOULD AFFECT- AS WE UNDERSTAND IT THAT WOULD AFFECT ALLOCATIONS RESTARTING. I'M NOT IN. THE TRUCK TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR NOT IN THE BUDGET YEAR BUT RATHER IN BUDGET YOUR PLUS ONE. I TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR SO THAT'S SORT OF ONE PIECE ON THE NEXT STEP THEN IS- LET'S SAY THERE'S SOME NET CHANGE IN REVENUE THAT RESULTED FROM IT I TAX CHANGE THAT. DATA WENT INTO EFFECT- THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF THE WAY THAT WOULD BE SLATE IS IT WOULD PRIMARY. PRIMARILY THINK POSSIBLY EXCLUSIVELY ON THE AT BAT BY MY I CAN'T THINK OF AN EXAMPLE WHERE IT WOULDN'T AFFECT ANYTHING BUT ALLOCATIONS THREE BECAUSE THE WAY IT WORKS IS. ALLOCATION ONE SERVER GETS ITS ACT AND THEN ALLOCATION TO WHICH IS- AMOUNTS THAT ARE FIXED IN STATUTE I THINK FINANCIAL FOLLOW UP ON THIS. OTHER DAY MOUNTS AN ALLOCATION TO OUR FIXED INSTEAD SHE DEMANDS AN ALLOCATION ONE NOT FIXED IN STATUTE BUT- WE'RE NOT DIRECTLY DEPENDENT ON THE AMOUNT OF TAX REVENUE. IS THEN ALLOCATION THREE THERE'S A THREE SERVE THREE ACCOUNTS WITH AND THAT. THE USE CAN GETS SIXTY PERCENT- ENVIRONMENTAL COUNT GETS TWENTY AND THE A LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCOUNT GETS TWENTY AND THEIR VARIOUS ALLOCATIONS WITHIN THOSE- THE LARGEST ONE OVERALL BEING- CHILD CARE SLOTS WITHIN THE USE ACCOUNT- SO I THINK. I PERHAPS MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME FOR ME TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF. YOU'D LIKE ADDITIONAL. THAT'LL WORK BECAUSE MS HARBISON OUR HAND AT. AND THERE CAN BE A HARVEST DEPARTMENT OF MY JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT FIRST PADDOCK YEAR AND A REAR SO. AFTER ONE OUR COVERED WHATEVER SLOW IS- AND THE NEXT YEAR. AND IF IT'S A SMALLER TOTAL POT OF MONEY WOULD STILL THE SAME. SPLIT SO STILL BE. THE SIXTY PER FOR YOU YOU TWENTY FOR. AND 20% FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. ARE FORTUNATE. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU AND THEN MY- THE SECOND QUESTION WAS I THINK FOR- DCC AND THAT'S OUR PROVISIONAL LICENSES ON TRACK TO TRANSITION TO ANNUAL LICENSES. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION ADEQUATELY AT DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT CANNABIS CONTROL I THERE ARE A SIGNIFICANT A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR LICENSEE POPULATION CURRENTLY HOLDS FROM NATIONAL LICENSES THAT IS SOMETHING THAT LICENSE WILL BE PHASED OUT I'M OVER THE NEXT YEAR AND A HALF. I AS A RESULT OF SOME LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY LAST SUMMER- WE WORKED EXPEDITIOUSLY TO GET ALMOST ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS OUT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO AID IN THE TRANSITION. OF PROVISIONAL LICENSEES TO ANNUAL LICENSES AYE SO WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL START TO SEE THOSE LICENSEES TRANSITION I IN THE COMING YEAR I HAD TO THREE YEARS I AND WE WILL MOST DEFINITELY NOTIFY THE LEGISLATURE IF WE FEEL THAT THERE WILL BE HICK UPS IN THAT PROCESS TO OUR REGULAR REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS ANY PROACTIVE. OUT REPORTING WE NEED. TO DO NOT TO FIGHT BACK. GREAT THANK YOU AND I JUST WANT TO ADD AS YOU ARE ARE LOOKING AT THAT IN COMPILING THAT DATA IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING THE SOCIAL EQUITY COMPONENT THERE WAS AN ARTICLE IN THE LA TIMES MAYBE A WEEK OR SO AGO THAT TALKED ABOUT THE CHALLENGES. THAT MANY FOLKS IN MY DISTRICT FACE TRYING TO YOU KNOW TRANSITION FROM PROVISIONAL TO ANNUAL THE COST OF THE LADIES YOU KNOW FOLKS HAVING TO CLOSE DOWN BUSINESSES BECAUSE OF IT. AND SO WE'RE GOING BACKWARDS- ED IN TERMS OF THE INTENTION BEHIND IT- AND SO YOU WOULD BE GOOD JUST END UP SEEING OR CONFIRMING WHO'S ACTUALLY GETTING THEM. AND WHO ISN'T. THANK YOU AND I'LL JUST ADD LA WAS A RECIPIENT OF APPROXIMATELY TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THAT GRANT FINDS OUT TO SUPPORT THEIR PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION AS WELL AS THEIR LICENSEES IN PARTICULAR THEIR LICENSE YOU SEE WHAT COMPLIANCE AYE SO WE ARE FOCUSING A LOT OF ENERGY ON TRYING TO SEE SUCCESS NOW AS FAR CARE GREAT THANK YOU SO MISTER SENATOR ROSS HAS A HAS A QUESTION. JUST A QUICK ONE MANAGER I WAS JUST TRYING TO REFRESH MY RECOLLECTION ONE OTHER POINT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME FOR ME BUT ON THESE ALLOCATIONS ONE TWO AND THREE IN THE SUB CATEGORIES DO WE- I REALIZE THAT BUT THE BASIC ALLOCATIONS I BELIEVE HER EITHER SEVEN THE PROPOSITION OR BY STATUTE DO WE READJUST THE SUB CATEGORIES. EACH YEAR IN THE BUDGET. OR ARE THOSE SOME. IN CONCRETE HARBISON CAN YOU ANSWER THAT. OR THANKS FOR HAVING ME AGAIN KIMBERLY HARVEST DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALLOCATION ONE VERY SOMEWHAT FROM. YEAR TO YEAR- LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS A PARTNER CAN CONTROL PROPOSAL THIS YEAR DEPART DO YOU HAVE. THERE IS PROPOSALS DOUBLE THEIR FUNCTIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED BY THE PROPOSITION BY STATUTE OCCASION TO IS PRETTY SET IN STONE AND THEN WHATEVER'S LEFT IS WHAT MATTERS MOST RELEGATION THREE THE FOLLOWING YEAR. I SEE SO THE ONLY FOR THE CATACLYSM CATEGORIES ARE. ARE SET IN STATUTE AND THAT THE ONLY THING THAT VARIES IS THE AMOUNT. CORRECT OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH IF I MAY I THINK JUST TO ADDRESS ONE ASPECT THE OTHER ASPECT OF YOUR QUESTION YOU ASKED IF THESE ARE SET IN THE BUDGET AND- JUST TO CLARIFY THESE ARE ALL CONTINUOUSLY PERFECT. CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATE. THAT'S RIGHT. SO FOR EXAMPLE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCOUNT. C. H. P. FOR IMPAIRED DRIVING ACTIVITIES AND I. T. ADMIN STAFF THAT'S A PERMANENT SUB CATEGORY. MS HARBISON IS SHAKING HER HEAD YES. YES REMEMBER WE YEARS AGO WE HAD CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS THANK YOU. DUN DUN DUN OKAY I SEE NO OTHER A LIGHTS ON. AND I MISS I HAD A BLACK YOUR HAND HAS BEEN UP BUT I'M ASSUMING YOU JUST DIDN'T LOWER IT. OKAY GREAT SO NOW WE WILL MOVE ON TO ANYONE WANTING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT REGARDING ITEMS ON THE AGENDA AS A REMINDER TODAY'S PARTICIPANT NUMBER IS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. TWO TWO SIX EIGHT ONE SIX THREE AND THE ACCESS CODE IS SEVEN SIX TWO TWO. FOUR SIX TWO. DUE TO RESTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF HEARINGS TECHNOLOGY. AND THEN CLEANING PROTOCOLS COMMITTEE CHAIRS MAY INSTITUTE TIME LIMITS ON TESTIMONY. TODAY I'M GOING TO ASK THAT EACH MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC PROVIDING COMMENT KEEP THEIR REMARKS WITHIN ONE MINUTE. NOW WE ARE GOING TO BEGIN WITH ANY WITNESSES THAT ARE HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM AND I SEE A COUPLE AND I HAVE TO SAY IT IS. IT WOULD IT WOULD BE CANNABIS THAT WOULD BRING PEOPLE OUT INTO THE CAPITAL TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE TESTIMONY. SO SIR PLEASE GO AHEAD. THERE ARE MEMBERS OF THIS REFRESHING TO BE HERE THANK YOU- RANDY MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE PARENT COMPANY WHICH IS BETTER KNOWN AROUND THE CAPITOL AS KHALIFA THE LARGEST VERTICALLY INTEGRATED COMPANY IN THE STATE WITH OPERATIONS FROM CHULA VISTA TO EUREKA IT'S GOING TO HIT ON THREE POINTS VERY QUICKLY ONE HAS NOT BEEN TALKED ABOUT MUCH BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS BY SOME. QUARTERS ABOUT- INSURING SOME REVENUE NEUTRALITY AND WHATEVER THIS TAX REFORM LOOKS LIKE WE'LL BE CAREFUL WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL IN HOW WE DO THAT IS REVENUE NEUTRALITY AS IT'S BEEN PRESENTED AS TALKED ABOUT RAISING THE EXCISE TAX TO MAKE UP FOR LOST AND CULTIVATION. ALL THAT DOES UNFORTUNATELY IS DISCOURAGE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO PURCHASE FROM ILLEGAL. FROM LEGAL ENTITIES FROM COMING TO LEGAL ENTITIES BECAUSE THE TAXES EVEN GOING TO BE HIGHER. THAN WHAT THEY'RE PAYING NOW. WE JUST NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW WE DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF REVENUE NEUTRALITY- RELATIVE TO THE ISSUE OF- ALLOCATION THREE TO USE SERVICES- THERE HAVE BEEN SOME FOLKS WHO ARE. ARGUING AGAINST ANY KIND OF TAX REFORM. BECAUSE THEY'RE FEARFUL THAT THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE MONEY ON THAT'S GOING TO THESE PROGRAMS. I MEAN WE APPRECIATE RESPECT THAT OBVIOUSLY WE WERE ALL PART OF PROP SIXTY FOUR BUT PUTTING IT TOGETHER. AND THEN THAT WAS IN PROP SIXTY FOUR SO WE'RE ALL COMMITTED. TO THOSE FUNDS GOING TO YOU SERVICES. THE PROBLEM IS OVER THE LAST TWO QUARTERS WE'VE SEEN A STEADY REDUCTION. IN TAX REVENUE- TO THE STATE. AS THAT REDUCES IT MEANS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE LESS MONEY AVAILABLE ANYHOW YEAR. FOR ALLOCATION FREE. SO THEY HAVE TO BE CAREFUL IN STANDING IN THE WAY OF TAX REFORM. BECAUSE IF WE DON'T GET TAX REFORM ALL WE'RE GOING TO SEE A REDUCTION RATHER THAN AN INCREASE IN TAXES. ON BASED ON THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A MORE ROBUST LEGAL- MARKET PLACE- I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE BRINGING UP THE ISSUE OF TRANSITION. FROM PROVISIONAL TO ANIMALS- APPRECIATE ON DIRECTOR ELLIOTT'S COMMENTS AND HOPE THAT THEY ARE ON TRACK TO DO THAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU. THE INDUSTRY IS PROFOUNDLY ANXIOUS. ABOUT WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO TRANSITION IN TIME. FOR THOSE WHO ARE OPERATING LEGALLY BUT ARE STILL PROVISIONAL. OF BEING ALLOWED TO TRANSITION TO ANNUAL IN TIME THAT THEY'RE NOT PUT OUT OF BUSINESS. CAN YOU LOSS OF TAX REVENUE LOSS OF JOBS. AND OTHER THINGS. AND THEN FINALLY IN ANSWER TO SENATOR NELSON'S QUESTION EARLIER ABOUT HOW WE DEAL WITH- THE ILLEGAL MARKET. I WANT TO POINT OUT ONE ISSUE THAT HAS COME UP RECENTLY- THERE WAS A- FABULOUS VICE DOT COM- ARTICLE IN JANUARY RELATIVE TO. ILLEGAL CULTIVATION OPERATIONS OUT IN THE FAR STRETCHES. OF SAMBAR DINO COUNTY. IN WHICH THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO ARE OPERATING THOSE ILLEGAL GROWS. I'M SAYING THAT THE REASON THEY DID SO. IS BECAUSE IT WAS A COST OF DO IT AT ANY THE PENALTIES ORG TEAM WORKS. DOING BUSINESS. A SLAP ON THE WRIST- AND SO THEY WOULD JUST TAKE THEIR- PICTURE OF PENALTY. AND COME BACK AND. CONTINUE TO GROW BECAUSE THE REVENUE THAT THEY RISK. WITH SO MUCH. WE NEED TO AT PENALTY THAT REALLY DO GO AFTER. PEOPLE WHO ARE FLAUNTING THE LAW IN A VERY VERY BIG WAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'RE ONE MORE WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MS. OBRECHT GLAD VULTEE HERE ON- WITH APEX GROUP ON BEHALF CARE RELIEF AND PERFECT UNION.

REITERATE OBVIOUSLY THE US TAXES ARE TOO HIGH FOR THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY AND IT'S A PIVOTAL MOMENT THAT WE ELIMINATE THE CULTIVATION TAX AND CUT IS TIGHT EXCISE TAX. WE ALSO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL- SUPPORT FOR EQUITY APPLICANTS AND I'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT AS THE- MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED EARLIER IS THAT PROVISIONAL LICENSING IS GOING TO BE A BIG ISSUE. STARTING ON JUNE THIRTIETH OF THIS YEAR THEY WILL NO LONGER BE ISSUING PROVISIONAL LICENSES AND WILL TAKE A VERY LONG TIME FOR NEW APPLICANTS TO. JOIN THE CALIFORNIA LEGAL CANNABIS MARKET SO IT'S GONNA MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT AFTER JUNE THIRTIETH SO I JUST WOULD LIKE THE- AT THIS POINT THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU.

YES SIR WE HAVE THREE MORTAR Q. WE'LL GO TO NUMBER THIRTY FIVE. HELLO THANK YOU FOR THIS TIME MY NAME IS GERRY KYLO- EIGHTEEN YEARS THAT CANNABIS RETAILER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED CAMAS BUSINESS ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT MULTIPLE SUPPLY CHAIN LICENSE HOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE AND WE HAVE ALSO- OFFERED A LEGISLATIVE BILL THIS YEAR ON TAX REDUCTION AND TAX REFORM. I'M I DO WANT TO COMMENT MOSTLY ON THE EXCISE TAX COLLECTION- I'VE HEARD SOME MAYBE MORE- IDEAS ABOUT HOW WE CAN HOLD PEOPLE MORE ACCOUNTABLE I THINK THE PART WHEN IT COMES TO EXCISE TAX COLLECTION. NO ONE SHOULD BE LOANING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TAX DOLLARS BEFORE THEY ARE COLLECTED IN THE CURRENT FORM OF TAX COLLECTIONS BUT THE BURDEN UPON EVERY PERSON UPON THE SUPPLY CHAIN TO PRE PAY TAXES. BEFORE THE TAXES ARE COLLECTED AS A RETAILER I THINK SIXTY THREE THOUSAND EVERY DOLLAR I COLLECT. THE TAXES. 35% OF EVERY DOLLAR GOES TOWARDS COST OF GOODS ELEVEN TONS OF EVERY DOLLAR GOES TOWARDS LABOR LEADING THE OF THE RETAILER ONE CENTS ON EVERY DOLLAR. TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE MY BUSINESS AND MAYBE HAVE A PROFIT MARGIN. THERE'S A PROBLEM THERE WE ARE NOT INCENTIVIZING PEOPLE TO BECOME RETAILERS WE'RE NOT INCENTIVIZING FIFTIES TO HAVE RETAIL AT THE HEART OF THE ORGANIZATION AND THE INDUSTRY. AND PART OF THIS PROBLEM AT ALL OF THE REGULATORY PENALTIES THAT ARE VALUABLE TO US FOR LATE PAYMENT OF TAXES. IF YOU'RE UNAWARE THERE'S A 50% PENALTY FOR A LATE TAXES. OR ANY CANNABIS SAID THAT NEED TO BE- GIVEN BACK WITH THE GFA. ADDED ON TOP OF AN EXISTING CONVERCENT PENALTY FOR ALREADY EXISTING TAXPAYERS UNDER PTSA LEADING ANY OTHER COMPANY THAT IS IN A LATE PAYMENT OF 50% PENALTY ON THE ALREADY AGREED JUST LEVEL OF TAXES. NOW IF WE DO TALK ABOUT COST. WHEN YOU GO THROUGH A SMALL LIST OF WHERE THE COST OF COMING FROM A FARM COMPLIANCE COST CULTIVATION TAX. TRANSPORTATION COSTS PROCESSING COSTS STORAGE COSTS PERISHABLE GOODS DISTRIBUTION TAX. SALES TEAM COST EXCISE TAX ON HOTEL COSTS AND RETAIL SALES TAX LOCAL GROSS RECEIPTS TAX AND FINALLY A FEDERAL TAXES ONLY ALLOWED TO DOCK CHEAPER CAR. THEY KNOW THEIR NORMAL BUSINESS AND- THIS IS WHAT THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY DEALING ONE. HIS IS WHAT RETAILERS ARE DEALING WITH CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW AS WE TRY TO MANAGE ALL THESE COSTS AND PAYMENT. AND I DO NOT THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE- AFFECTING TAXES BEFORE THE CUSTOMER. PAID FOR THE PRODUCT THUS LEAVING OUT MORE LIKE THE SALES TAX WHICH ALL OF US IN THE RETAIL SPACE HAS BEEN ABLE TO. COMPLY WITH I REALLY THINK ARE ACTUALLY ACTUALLY MORE LIKE OUR SALES TAX AND TAKE ALL THE OTHER- COST OF GOODS AND REQUIREMENTS AND TAXES. OUT OF THE COST OF COMPLIANCE- AND PUT IT MORE INTO THE HANDS OF THE CONSUMER AND THE CONSUMER IS ALSO BEING QUITE. A. PRICE SENSITIVITY OF CONSUMERS OVER EIGHT EIGHTEEN YEARS THAT I'VE SEEN BEHAVE CHANGE. THEY CHANGED THEIR QUICKLY TWENTY. ONE TOOK ON REGULATORY A PROFIT FOUR. THEIR BEHAVIORS CHANGED AND CONSUMERS OF CHANGED THE PROBLEM IS THE THAT WE WORKED. A THE NEWLY RIGHT WE CAME. THE FOUR EVEN ARE START TO HEAR. IN ADVERTISED. THAT HE'LL GOOD AND DRUNK. RIGHT SHE. ADVERTISEMENT THE OPERATOR THAT IT IS CHEAPER BUY. INTO IF WE ARE NOT TO THAT WE ARE. TO FOR AND- OF THE LIFT OFF THE IS GROWING YEAR OVER YEAR AND WE ARE GOING TO IN THE FOR ANOTHER ON DRUGS. WITH OVER ENFORCEMENT WE NEED TO FIND A COMPETITIVE NATURE BELIEVE THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY IN A PLACE TO COMPETE WITH ALREADY EXISTING CUSTOMERS IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR THAT YOU KNOW THAT WAS WELL OVER THE MINUTE BUT YOU CAUGHT ME. FELT MODERATOR DO WE HAVE- ANYONE ELSE ON THE LINE I THINK WE HAVE ONE MORE PERSON. THERE ARE TWO MORE IN OUR QUEUE. OKAY NOW GO TO NUMBER THIRTY FOUR GREAT THANK YOU AND I AM BACK IN SO WE WILL BE TIMING THIS ITEM IN IT. NUMBER THIRTY FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD. SHE ALSO ECHOED THE SENTIMENTS OF JERRY WHO JUST SPOKE ABOUT SOCIAL EQUITY PARTICIPANT WHO'S WAITING TO GET A LICENSE IN LOS ANGELES AND SINCE THE RETAILERS IN THAT AREA DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE THE TWO EIGHTY TAX RESTRICTIONS LISTED AND HAVE AN EXCISE TAX THE CITY EDITION TO ALL THE STATE TAXES. IT DOES MAKE IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPETE WITH THE ILLICIT MARKET I USE MY TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT MODERATOR- NEXT PERSON IN THE QUEUE.

AFTERNOON JEANINE COLEMAN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ORIGINS HELPFUL- WE REPRESENT NEARLY NINE HUNDRED LIFE AND SMALL INDEPENDENT CANNABIS BUSINESSES AND SIX OIL PRODUCING COUNTY COUNTIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. HUNDREDS OF SMALL INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES FARMERS CURRENTLY FACE A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF DROPPING OUT OF THE LIGHT MARKET DUE TO COLLAPSE IN THE WHOLESALE MARKET PRICES FOR CANNABIS FLOWER. COMPOUNDED BY A FLAT WAIT A CULTIVATION TAX WHICH REMAINS THE SAME REGARDLESS OF MARKET CONDITIONS. THE CHALLENGES ARE PARTICULARLY SEVERE FOR OUTDOOR CANNABIS FARMERS WHO TYPICALLY HAVE LOWER YIELDS AND SELL PRODUCTS HERBAL CRISIS THEN HOPE VENTURES UTILIZED MORE INTENSIVE CULTIVATION METHODS. NUMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE HOTEL PRICES FOR OUTDOOR CAMERAS HAVE DROPPED FROM APPROXIMATELY A THOUSAND DOLLARS A POUND YOU'RE PROBABLY THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A POUND. DURING THE SAME TIME THE WAIT IS CULTIVATION TAX ON CANNABIS BUYERS INCREASED FROM ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR DOLLARS A POUND YOU. GET ONE DOLLARS AN OUNCE. AS A RESULT STATE CALLED THE TAX ALONE ACCOUNT TOWARDS PERCENT OR MORE. CRISIS ARE. AND WHILE CURRENT WORKING. HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE INEQUITY OF THE CULTIVATION TAX MANY OF THE CULTIVATION TAX LIMITATIONS ARE INHERENT TO OUR BASE WITH. A FARM BASED TAX ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. BIGELOW WEIGHT BASED% TAX ON CAMPUS FAR CANNOT ACCOUNT. FOR WIDELY VARYING DEGREES OF FLOUR. ALL RIGHT WIDELY VARYING GRADES OF FLOUR WHICH CAN BASED FISHING MATHIS. ALSO EVEN BASED ON THE CULTIVATION PRODUCED BY A SINGLE PLANT. MANY OF THE LEGACY SMALL FARMS THAT WE REPRESENT OUR HOMESTEAD FARMERS CANNABIS IS NOT JUST A BUSINESS FOR THEM.

WITH THE- WITH THE- THE PROVISIONAL LICENSES IN THE THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS. DECIDING THAT THEY WEREN'T GOING TO ALLOW CANNABIS IN THEIR COMMUNITY- THEY'VE DRAGGED THEIR FEET IN TERMS OF- CREATING A PROVISIONAL LICENSE AND- WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME HELP ON THIS BECAUSE THE AS I RECALL PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR LEFT IT UP TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT WAS PART OF THE SALE THE SALE JOB- WITH IT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COULDN'T PROHIBITED BUT BAD TO DECIDE HOW THEY REGULATED IT AND SO WE MADE NEEDED IT COME BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT THIS HAD TO DO WITH THE TAX PART OF IT AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.
