I LIKE IT. WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND START WE'RE GONNA CALL THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT. COMMITTEE MEETING TO ORDER I'D LIKE TO WELCOME OUR MEMBERS THAT ARE HERE ASSEMBLY WOMAN SMITH ASSEMBLY WOMAN THAT GOMEZ REYES WE ALSO HAVE ON THE COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER REBEKAH BEAR QUE HAN ASSEMBLYMEMBER BURKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER DEEP ASSEMBLY MEMBER FLORA ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY.

ALSO THANK YOU TO THE PANELISTS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC PRESENT TODAY AND TO THE TO THOSE WHO MAY BE WATCHING THE HEARING ONLINE WANTED TO FORM THIS COMMITTEE TO BEGIN A MEANINGFUL CONVERSATION ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S EARLY. INTERVENTION SERVICES AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE OUR SYSTEMS. EARLY INTERVENTION EXISTS TO SUPPORT FAMILIES AND HELP THEM ACCESS AND COORDINATE SERVICES FOR THEIR CHILDREN THE SYSTEMS ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. WHOSE HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT BENEFIT GREATLY FROM ENGAGING AND EARLY SERVICES WHAT CALIFORNIA'S INVESTED BILLIONS INTO EARLY EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE FOR CHILDREN INCLUDING A HISTORIC TWO POINT THREE BILLION AND THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. TOO MANY CHILDREN ARE STILL UNDERSERVED INNER SLIPPING THROUGH THE CRACKS IN THE SYSTEM. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT AFFECTS MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS THROUGHOUT THE STATE INCLUDING MEMBERS OF MY OWN FAMILY. TODAY'S HEARING WILL BE FORWARD THINKING WE HAVE IN BLIGHTED SEVERAL PANELS OF EXPERTS HERE TO DISCUSS THE CURRENT STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S EARLY INTERVENTION. SYSTEMS AS WELL AS SPECIFIC POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADVANCE OUR SERVICES THE FORMAT OF THE HEARING TODAY IS BROKEN UP INTO THREE PANELS FIRST WE WILL HEAR NOR OVERVIEW OF CALIFORNIA'S EARLY INTERVENTION SYSTEMS FROM CHILDREN NOW ONE OF THE LEADING HER EARLY CHILDHOOD POLICY ADVOCATES WE ALSO HEAR PERSONAL TESTIMONY FROM TWO PARENTS WHO WILL DISCUSS THEIR DIFFICULTIES. NAVIGATING THE LANDSCAPE OF IDENTIFY IDENTIFICATION INTERVENTION SERVICES FOR THEIR CHILDREN DURING OUR SECOND PANEL WE WILL HEAR FROM THE SPEAKERS BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION WILL DISCUSS THE RECENT REPORT WHICH INCLUDED RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW THE STATE CAN IMPROVE A RANGE OF EDUCATION. AND IT PENSION SERVICE WHICH WAS SPECIAL. IN OUR LAST PANEL WE WILL HAVE CONVENE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE FIRST FIVE ASSOCIATION AND THE INFANT DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION. DURING THIS PANEL WE WILL LEARN ABOUT AN INNOVATIVE PROGRAM THAT IS HELPING PARENTS SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATE EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES WE WILL ALSO HEAR ABOUT EARLY. SERVICE PROVIDERS AND HOW WE CAN IMPROVE ACCESS TO SERVICES AND SERVICE DELIVERY AFTER OUR PANELISTS OF INCLUDED WE WILL ALLOW TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. IS MY HOPE THAT WE HAVE A THOROUGH AND PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION TODAY AND I WELCOME MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO CONTRIBUTE BY ASKING QUESTIONS OF OUR PANELISTS. IT IS MY GOAL THAT WE WALK AWAY FROM TODAY'S HEARING WITH IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN ENACT. REAL CHANGE TO IMPROVE OUR EARLY INTERVENTION SYSTEMS FOR CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS AT THIS POINT I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO ANY MEMBERS IF THEY HAVE ANY OPENING REMARKS. PLEASE ASSEMBLY MISTER CHAIR. HI I WANT TO THANK YOU AND THE PANELISTS FOR JOINING US TODAY I THINK THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT. TOPIC. I DO WANT TO SAY HOW FORTUNATE WE ARE THAT WE HAVE A SPEAKER WHOSE BACKGROUND IS. IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND THE GOVERNOR WHOSE PASSION MIRRORS THAT. WHEN THE SPEAKER CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE HE HELPED TO BRING EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION TO THE FOREFRONT OF THE CONVERSATION WITH THE SPEAKERS BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION. COMMITTEE OF BECAUSE HE LIKE THE REST OF US HERE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IS AND HOW THAT REALLY IS THE EQUALIZER FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR FAMILIES. LITTLE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS DEVELOPED OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD. AND AFTER THOROUGH RESEARCH. AND STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS WITH FAMILIES AND PARENTS AND OTHERS I EMPHASIZED A FEW KEY THEMES. THE NEED TO ENSURE HIGH QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO PROGRAMS FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA FAMILIES THE IMPERATIVE NATURE OF EARLY INTERVENTION SCREENINGS AND SERVICES FOR CHILDREN TO INSURE THEIR HEALTH AND WELL BEING. IS TAKEN CARE OF AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE AND THE REQUIREMENT OF THE STATE TO INVEST IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND THE WHOLE SYSTEM CREATING A LARGE INTEGRATED AN INTER AGENCY GOVERNANCE INFRASTRUCTURE TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND TO REMOVE BARRIERS FOR FAMILIES IN EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS. AS I LOOK OUT THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE HERE IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE MANY OF YOU WHO WORK ON THAT COMMISSION AND MANY OF YOU WHO ALSO CAME AND SPOKE TO THE COMMISSION. WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE QUITE AWHILE TO ACHIEVE EVERYTHING THAT THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION'S REPORT. SUGGESTED AND REQUESTED BUT I'M HOPEFUL THAT KNOWING THAT OUR SPEAKER OUR GOVERNOR AND MANY MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE REST OF YOU HERE. AND INCLUDING NUMBERS HERE OF OUR SELECT COMMITTEE. KNOWING THAT WE ARE FOCUSING AT LEAST AT THIS MOMENT ON OUR CHILDREN I KNOW THAT THERE'S SO MUCH THAT CAN BE DONE I DO WANT TO APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE THAT I WILL HAVE TO LEAVE A LITTLE EARLY BUT I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO TODAY'S. CONTINUED CONVERSATIONAL SUCH AN IMPORTANT TOPIC THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU. RIGHT WITHOUT WILL BEGIN WITH OUR FIRST PANEL I'D LIKE TO CALL IT ANGELA RATHER MAIL FROM CHILDREN NOW HAD THE BRAIN AND WITH THE SHOULD DIG. GARCIA WHO WILL GIVE US AN OVERVIEW OF CALIFORNIA'S EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES AND FIRSTHAND TESTIMONY DESCRIBING THE DIFFICULTIES. OF NAVIGATING THE SYSTEMS. AB MEMBERS THERE'S A DOCUMENT FROM CHILDREN NOW I BELIEVE IN YOUR PACKETS. SO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR HAVING US AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION TODAY MY NAME IS ANGELA ROCKER MEL I'M HERE FROM CHILDREN NOW AND TODAY I'M GOING TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE DATA RESEARCH AND POLICY CONTOURS RELATED TO THIS ISSUE FOR YOUR COMMITTEE. BIRTH THE THREE IS A CRITICAL WINDOW OF DEVELOPMENTS AS MANY OF YOU KNOW IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF LIFE BABIES BRAINS ARE FORMING MORE THAN ONE MILLION NEW NEURAL CONNECTIONS EVERY SECOND. WE'RE LEARNING SO MUCH MORE ABOUT THIS SO RAPIDLY FROM SCIENCE JUST A FEW YEARS AGO THEY THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY SEVEN HUNDRED NEURAL CONNECTIONS EVERY SECOND. AND THAT DEVELOPMENTS THAT FOUNDATIONS FOR HOW FAR KIDS WILL ULTIMATELY GO IN SCHOOL WHAT THEY ARE AND AS ADULTS AND HOW HEALTHY THEY ARE OVER THEIR LIFETIMES. THIS DEVELOPMENT IS FUELED BY RELATIONSHIPS WITH CARING ADULTS WHO SUPPORT THEIR GROWTH AND LEARNING. AS IT'S EVER CHANGING ACROSS MOTOR COGNITIVE SOCIAL AND LANGUAGE DOMAINS AND THOSE ARE THE S. YEARS. THIS RAPID DEVELOPMENT CAN REALLY LEAVE PARENTS WITH MANY QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS AND IT CAN ALSO MASK MISSED MILESTONES IN ONE OR MORE AREAS ALTHOUGH MOST CHILDREN PROGRESS ALONG DEVELOPMENTS IN. TIMELY AND PREDICTABLE PATTERNS NOT ALL DO YOU AND AN ESTIMATED EXPERIENCE SOME FORM OF DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY. RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS THAT EXPERIENCES OF TRAUMA AND CIRCUMSTANCE OF HIS OF ADVERSITY DURING THIS SENSITIVE PERIOD CAN INCREASE CHANCES OF DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS IN FACT IT'S THE MOST COMMON MANIFESTATION OF ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES OF LEARNING A BEHAVIOR TROUBLES. THE STAKES IN CALIFORNIA ARE HIGH BECAUSE THE SHEER NUMBER OF INFANTS AND TODDLERS WE HAVE THERE ARE TWO MILLION CHILDREN UNDER THREE YEARS OLD IN CALIFORNIA THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE LOW INCOME THAN OTHER AGE GROUPS THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO SPEAK A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH AT HOME. THEY ARE MORE LIKELY. TO BE ISOLATED FROM THE SYSTEM IS MEANT TO SERVE THEM BECAUSE PARENTS ARE YOUNG AND HAVEN'T HAD AS MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH GOVERNMENTS. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT RACE AN INCOME BASED DISPARITIES AN ACHIEVEMENT OPPORTUNITY OPEN VERY EARLY IN CHILDREN'S LIVES. AND ONCE PRESENT THEIR MORE DIFFICULT TO RESOLVE AND MORE LIKELY TO PERSIST THROUGH CHILDHOOD AND ADULTHOOD BUT THE RIGHT KIND OF HELP AT THE RIGHT TIME CAN GO A LONG LONG WAY FOR KIDS. I'M DESPITE SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE THAT IDENTIFYING DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS AND DISABILITIES AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE IS. CREATES BETTER OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND ACTUALLY REDUCES UNLESS PUBLIC COSTS FOR INTERVENTION CALIFORNIA IS NOT DOING IT THE WAY WE SHOULD BE. LESS THAN HALF OF ABOUT 43% OF ALL STUDENTS NEEDING SPECIAL EDUCATION SUPPORTER IDENTIFIED PRIOR TO KINDERGARTEN. AND THIS COMES WITH COSTS NOT JUST FOR CHILDREN BUT ALSO FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS LA UNIFIED SPENDS ONE BILLION OF IT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET ON SPECIAL EDUCATION. EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND INTERVENTION IS A TWO SIDED COIN TO GET CHILDREN THE SUPPORTS THEY NEED YOU MUST FIRST IDENTIFY THE CHILDREN WHO NEED SUPPORT. EXPERTS LIKE THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS RECOMMENDS ROUTINE FORMALIZED DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING FOR ALL INFANTS AND TODDLERS AT NINE EIGHTEEN AND THIRTY MONTHS OF AGE IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO IDENTIFY WHAT CHILDREN MIGHT NEED IN. TERMS OF SUPPORT A DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING MANY OF YOU MAY HAVE FILLED THEM OUT FOR YOUR OWN CHILDREN OR FOR FAMILY MEMBERS IT'S AN AGE SPECIFIC CHECKLIST THAT PROVIDES A SNAPSHOT OF WHERE KIDS ARE. AND ENABLES PARENTS PEDIATRICIANS AND EDUCATORS TO IDENTIFY PLACES WHERE A CHILD MAY NEED ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENT TREATMENT OR SUPPORTS. FOR CHILDREN WHO DO NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT EARLY INTERVENTION IS CRITICAL. IT CAN BE INTENSIVE SUCH AS INDIVIDUAL SPEECH LANGUAGE OCCUPATIONAL AND PHYSICAL THERAPIES OR LESS INTENSIVE SUCH AS CLASSROOM STRATEGIES AT HOME LEARNING STRATEGIES THAT PARENTS IMPLEMENTED. IT CAN BE JUST SOMETHING THAT A CHILD NEEDS FOR A SHORT TIME OR SOMETHING THAT THEY NEED OVER A LONGER PERIOD TO GET THE BOOST THEY NEED FOR. MOST IMPORTANTLY BECAUSE INFANTS AND TODDLERS COME ATTACHED TO FAMILIES. THE EARLY INTERVENTION SYSTEMS ARE VERY EXPLICITLY INTENDED TO ALSO SERVE IN SUPPORT PARENTS. AND CARE GIVERS OF THESE VERY YOUNG CHILDREN SO GUIDING THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS COORDINATING SERVICES AND ENGAGING THEM DIRECTLY IN THEIR CHILD'S LEARNING AND WHATEVER INTERVENTIONS MAY BE DELIVERED. IN AN IDEAL WORLD A SYSTEM OF UNIVERSAL DEVELOPMENTAL BEHAVIORAL SCREENS FOR EVERY CHILD WOULD WORK HAND IN HAND WITH THE ROBUST MULTI DISCIPLINARY EARLY INTERVENTION SYSTEM. IN REALITY IT'S AN AN EVEN FRAGMENTED MAYES AND THERE'S LOTS OF GAPS FAMILIES MAY NOT KNOW HELP IS AVAILABLE OR WHERE TO GET IT. FAMILIES WITH CONCERNS MAY BE TOLD TO WAIT AND SEE. THEY MAY FACE LONG WAITS FOR SERVICES OR A LACK OF PROVIDERS AND MANY WILL END UP RECEIVING SERVICES FROM DIFFERENT ENTITIES THAT ARE NOT WELL ALIGNED OR COORDINATED. SO IF WE LOOK AT THIS FROM A SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA'S YOUNGEST CHILDREN ARE NOT CURRENTLY RECEIVING DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS AT ALL. LESS THAN ONE QUARTER OF ALL INFANTS AND TODDLERS RECEIVE A DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING AND LESS THAN ONE IN TEN BLACK INFANTS TO. A RECENT STATE OVERSIGHT REPORT AUDIT REPORT EXCUSE ME. DOWN THAT ONE IN TWO YEAR OLDS IN MEDI CAL HAVE THE LOWEST PREVENTIVE CARE UTILIZATION AS WELL. 42% AND MOST CERTAINLY MISSING OUT ON WELL CHILD VISITS AND SCREENINGS. AND IT ISN'T FOR A LACK POLICY. IN FACT ALMOST EVERY GOVERNMENT SYSTEM THAT TOUCHES YOUNG CHILDREN HEALTHCARE EDUCATION CHILD WELFARE PUBLIC HEALTH. IN MORE HAS POLICY SPECIFYING THAT IT SHOULD EITHER INSURE OR CAN DOCKS ROUTINE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS ON THE CHILDREN THAT IT SERVES. OF SPECIAL IMPORTANCE AND I THINK TO THE COMMITTEE AND TO OTHERS. IS THAT THE HEALTH CARE MANDATES ARE WHO. BECAUSE I 97% OF CALIFORNIA KIDS DO YOU HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE AND THESE SERVICES SHOULD BE FUNDED WITHIN EXISTING REVENUE STREAMS. ON THE EARLY INTERVENTION SIDE THERE CHALLENGES AS WELL. EARLY START WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES ACT IN RESPONSE TO OP PART C. OF THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT. IT'S ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES THROUGH THE STATE'S NETWORK OF TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. EARLY START IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING LOCATING AND EVALUATING INFANTS AND TODDLERS SPECIFICALLY WHO MAY NEED AN BE ELIGIBLE FOR EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES THIS IS KNOWN AS CHILD FIND IN OUR STATE. TO RECEIVE SERVICES UNDER EARLY START CHILDREN MUST DEMONSTRATE ELIGIBILITY BASED UPON. THIS SEVERITY OVER THE CUMULATIVE NUMBER OF DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS OR DISABILITIES THAT THEY HAVE. EARLY START IS STRUGGLING YOU WILL HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS LATER IN THE PANEL TODAY ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES BUT FOR FIVE OF THE LAST TEN YEARS EARLY STARTED HAVING NEEDS INTERVENTION STATUS WITH THE FEDERAL OFFICE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS. AND THE REASON GETTING DOWN TO FAX TO ANALYSIS CALIFORNIA RANKED. SHOULD THE CALIFORNIA RANKS FORTY SIXTH. THIRTEEN FULL PERCENTAGE POINTS LOWER THAN SOME OF THE NEAREST STATES. ON THE TIMING TO DEVELOP A CHILD'S INITIAL SERVICE PLAN AND BEGIN SERVICES. HI AND THIS STATE SEPARATING IS SLIGHTLY IMPROVED NOW FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS TO. NEEDS ASSISTANCE BUT SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE ISSUES DO REMAIN. REALLY START ALSO MIGHT BE MISSING THOUSANDS OR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF KIDS EACH YEAR. I NEARLY THREE OUT OF FOUR CALIFORNIA CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL HEALTHCARE NEEDS UNDER THREE YEARS OF AGE DIDN'T RECEIVE EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES. AND CALIFORNIA SERVES A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF THE INFANT TODDLER POPULATION BAN ON NATIONAL AVERAGES ACROSS OTHER STATES PART C. PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT 12215% OF YOUNG KIDS LIKELY ARE EXPERIENCING DELAYS AND YOU DO THE MATH AGAINST YOU MILLION INFANTS AND TODDLERS LIKE IT'S MUCH MORE THAN THE FORTY FORTY ONE THOUSAND THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING SERVED IN THE PROGRAM. SO TO ME THE CALIFORNIA IS A PLACE OF OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERY SINGLE CHILD WE REALLY MUST MAKE A MULTI PRONGED STRATEGIC POLICY IN BUDGET DECISIONS THAT LINE UP WITH WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE DIVERSITY OF OUR YOUNGER. CHILDREN THEIR FAMILIES WITH WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT BRAIN SCIENCE AND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT WORKS WHAT WORKS IN TERMS OF INTERVENTIONS. INSURING ROUTINE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING AN EQUITABLE ACCESS TO EARLY INTERVENTION WILL HELP REDUCE GAPS THAT WE KNOW WHERE THEY'RE BEFORE KINDERGARTEN. HELP CHILDREN GET OFF TO A HEALTHIER START AND IMPROVE THE STATE'S BOTTOM LINE AT THE SAME TIME. I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO INDIVIDUALS TO SHARE PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE ON THESE. ISSUES HI HEATHER BREEN AND THE TEACHER DEGRAZIA ARE BOTH PARENTS OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM. CURRENTLY TEACH YOU HAVE DIFFERENT STORIES THEY LIVE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE AND THEIR CHILDREN WERE DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM AT DIFFERENT STAGES. YET THEIR STORIES HIGHLY WITH A AND SO MANY FAMILIES EXPERIENCE IN OUR STATE WHEN ENCOUNTERING THE EARLY INTERVENTION SYSTEM. HI HEATHER TESTIMONY WILL FOCUS ON THE ROLE OF IDENTIFICATION AND COMPLEXITIES OF RECEIVING A DIAGNOSIS FOR HER DAUGHTER. AND WE TEACH HIS TESTIMONY WILL FOCUS ON THE ARDUOUS NATURE OF RECEIVING ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET'S CONTINUE WITH US MONEY PLEASE. MORNING THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE MY NAME IS HEATHER BRAIN AND THE MOTHER OF A SEVEN YEAR OLD GIRL WITH AUTISM SHE WAS DIAGNOSED DIAGNOSED BETWEEN THE AGES OF THREE AND FOUR. I'D LIKE TO SHARE OUR STORY OF IDENTIFYING SOMETIMES GETTING A SCREENING AND FINALLY A DIAGNOSIS AND REFERRAL TO SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW MANY OTHER PARENTS ENCOUNTERED SIMILAR OBSTACLES IN THIS PROCESS. WHEN MY DAUGHTER AS ONLY TWO I DID CONTACT REGIONAL CENTER EXPRESSING CONCERN THAT SHE STILL WASN'T TALKING SHE BOBBLED SAID A FEW WORDS BUT WASN'T MEETING THE MILESTONE THAT I READ AND ON THE BOOKS. AFTER A BRIEF CONVERSATION I WAS TOLD THAT BECAUSE SHE COULD SAYS WORDS SHE DIDN'T QUALIFY FOR SERVICES. I WORK WITH A LOT OF CLINICIANS NOT ONE OF THEM WOULD CONSIDER MAKING A CONCLUSION ABOUT A CHILD NEEDS WITHOUT SEEING THEM IN PERSON BUT I HAD. A CLOSED DOOR ON THE PHONE WITH ONE CALL. EVERY PEDIATRICIAN THAT WE SAW DID USE A DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING TOOL. BUT THEY ALL GAVE IT TO US ON A CLIPBOARD IN THE WAITING ROM. NO IN ASSISTED US WITH UNDERSTANDING THE QUESTIONS INTERPRETING THEM. IF I ASKED FOR CLARIFICATION I WAS TOLD TO DO THE BEST I COULD. AS FIRST TIME PARENTS WE HAD NO REFERENCE. FOR WHAT OTHER CHILDREN LOOK LIKE HOW THOSE SKILLS WERE EXHIBITED IN OTHER KIDS. AND WE WANTED HER TO BE NORMAL AND SO WE TENDED TO FILL THOSE FORMS OUT WITH THAT. BIAS CLOUDING OUR JUDGMENT. IT WAS OUR DAUGHTER'S PRESCHOOL TEACHER WHO FIRST NOTICED SHE TOLD IS THIS USING A LACK OF SPONTANEOUS LANGUAGE BUT THIS WAS QUICKLY FOLLOWED BY REASSURANCE THAT IT WAS PROBABLY NOTHING. HER RECOMMENDATION WAS SIMPLY TO NOTE IT AND GIVE IT SIX MONTHS. WE FINALLY SAW OUR PEDIATRICIAN FOR REFERRAL AND HE ALSO SAID IT'S LIKELY NOTHING BUT LET'S GET HER A DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING JUST IN CASE AND HE REFERRED US TO A CLINIC. MONTHS LATER AFTER I HAD PULLED RECORDS FOR A PROVIDER I HAPPEN TO READ HIS NOTES AND HE DESCRIBED HER AS GROSSLY DISENGAGED. AT THAT ENCOUNTER. I THINK HE KNEW I THINK THE TEACHER KNEW. AND I THINK THEY WERE AFRAID TO TALK TO ME ABOUT IT. AND I MAY HAVE REACTED BADLY I AM IT MAY HAVE BEEN AN UNPLEASANT TALK CONVERSATION BUT I ALSO WOULD HAVE GOTTEN SCREAM CENTER SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE ON THE FRONT LINES WORKING WITH YOUNG CHILDREN KNOW HOW TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH PARENTS AND GET SCREENINGS. DONE QUICKER QUICKER. SO NOW IN THE MIDST OF GRIEF EXHAUSTION AND ESCALATING DIFFICULTY WITH MY DAUGHTER. I STARTED INTO A CONFUSING BUREAUCRATIC TIME CONSUMING PROCESS TO GET A FORMAL DIAGNOSIS BUT WITH LITTLE GUIDANCE OR ASSISTANCE. NOT HAVING GUIDANCE MEANT THAT I MADE MISSTEPS AND THERE WERE DELAYS. TO GIVE YOU A SENSE THE INITIAL CONVERSATION WITH HER PRESCHOOL TEACHER WAS IN JUNE OF TWENTY FIFTEEN. WE SAW THE PEDIATRICIAN TO REFER GET REFERRAL TO A SCREENING IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY FIFTEEN. IT WAS ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BEFORE WE HAD A DIAGNOSIS FROM A PSYCHOLOGIST AT REGIONAL CENTER. AND WHEN WE FINALLY RECEIVE THE FINAL REPORT FROM REGIONAL CENTER THAT OPENED THE DOOR TO THE FULL ARRAY OF SERVICES. IT WAS NOVEMBER OF TWENTY SIXTEEN. SO WELL ALMOST A YEAR AND A HALF SINCE WE FIRST STARTED TO NOTICE SOMETHING WAS WRONG THAT'S FAR TOO LONG. AND BY THIS TIME MY DAUGHTER WAS ALMOST FOUR. AND SHE DIDN'T RECEIVE YEARS OF EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES THAT MIGHT HAVE CHANGED THE COURSE OF HER DEVELOPMENT. THAT WOULD HELP US PROPERLY CARE FOR HER AND I BELIEVE WOULD HAVE LED TO A BETTER OUTCOME FOR HER. I HAD WORKED IN SPECIAL EDUCATION AS A PROFESSIONAL. I SPENT FIVE YEARS WORKING FOR FIRST FIVE LA. I HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE A GREAT JOB AN EXCELLENT HEALTHCARE COVERAGE MY MOM WAS A TEACHER I HAD SEVERAL FRIENDS WHO WERE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATORS. IF ANY PARENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THEIR CHILD DIAGNOSED EARLY. IT WILL BE ME. MY DAUGHTER FELL THROUGH THE CRACKS MY FAMILY STRUGGLED TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM. THANK YOU PLEASE HELLO. MY NAME IS THAT THE SAID A GRASSY ARE I AM A SINGLE MOTHER OF THREE CHILDREN WE LIVE IN A THOMAS NEIGHBORHOOD HERE IN SACRAMENTO. MY TWO YOUNGEST CHILDREN AGES SEVEN JACK LEANED. AND BRANDON WHOSE AGE THREE HAVE AUTISM. I WORK IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AS A FULL BOTTOM IS AND I MENTION NATION WHO DRAWS BLOOD FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS IRON ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND ANNUALLY AND- THIS IS TOO MUCH TO QUALIFY FOR A NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. IT WASN'T UNTIL MY YOUNGEST SON WAS DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM AT THE AGE TO THAT HE QUALIFIED FOR MEDI CAL. AFTER MY CHILDREN WERE DIAGNOSED I WOULD START WANTED TO START SERVICES IMMEDIATELY I KNEW EARLY INTERVENTION IS THE KEY AND I WANTED TO GIVE THEM THE BEST POSSIBLE START. I KNEW SERVICES WOULD BE EXPENSIVE BUT IT DIDN'T I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE SO DIFFICULT. TO GET THE SERVICES FOR MY CHILDREN THE NEEDS THAT THEY REQUIRE. MY DAUGHTER IS NOW SEVEN AND SHE'S CONSIDERED HIGH FUNCTIONING. SHE WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM AGE TO AN AXIS ACCESSING SERVICES TO OUR REGIONAL CENTER WAS EASY ENOUGH BUT AT AGE THREE THEY WANTED TO TAKE HER OFF OF THE ALL TO REGIONAL SERVICES WHICH MEANS. THAT I HAD TO START THE PROCESS ALMOST ALL OVER AGAIN AND FIGHT FOR MY DAUGHTER SAID THAT SHE DIDN'T LOSE THOSE SERVICES I KNEW ABOUT THE LATTER MEN ACT AND SO I TOLD THEM THAT THEY WILL NOT TAKE HER OFF OF ALL TO REGIONAL SERVICES BECAUSE OF THE LETTERMAN ACTED THAT THEY NEEDED A SERVER TISSUE IS EIGHTEEN. SO WITH ACCESSING THE SERVICES. THE TRANSITION TO THE SPECIAL EDUCATION SYSTEM WAS SEVERELY CHALLENGING. THE SCHOOL WAS INITIALLY NOT ACCOMMODATING IN SETTING UP MY DAUGHTER'S IEP AND I HAD TO CONTINUALLY WORK WITH THEM. TO ENSURE THAT SHE WAS AN APPROPRIATE SETTING AND GETTING THE RIGHT CARE FOR HER NEEDS. BECAUSE EACH CHILD IS DIFFERENT AND SO IT WAS VERY FRUSTRATING TO HAVE TO FILL THAT I HAD TO FIGHT FOR HER TWICE. MY SON HE HAS A MUCH HIGHER NEED DUE TO A SEVERITY OF HIS DISABILITY AND FORTUNATELY HE QUALIFIED FOR MEDI CAL. WHICH HELPS COVER THE COST OF HIS CARE WITHOUT THIS COVERAGE MY CO PAY FOR ADVANCE BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS SERVICES. WOULD BE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED PER MONTH. WHICH IS WAY TOO MUCH WHEN I CAN BARELY PUT FOOD ON MY CHILD ON MY TABLE AT HOME HOWEVER ENROLLING MY SON IN MEDI CAL HAS BEEN A HUGE CHALLENGE IT WAS DELAYED AND IT DELAYED THE AXIS OF SERVICES THAT HE GREATLY NEEDED. I HAVE SPENT COUNTLESS DAYS FROM WORK OFF OF WORK ON THE PHONE TRYING TO NAVIGATE HOW TO ENROLL AND GET HIM COVERAGE THE PROBLEM ALL STEMMING FROM DIFFERENT INSURANCES. WHEN TRANSFERRING MY SENT OVER TO THE SPECIAL EDUCATION SYSTEM I RECALL THAT THE AYE AYE E. P. CHALLENGES. THAT I HAD EXPERIENCE WITH MY DAUGHTER AND I THOUGHT IT WAS BEST FOR MY KIDS IF I HIRED AN ADVOCATE. BECAUSE THE USE OF A PROFESSIONAL ADVOCATE TO NAVIGATE THIS DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICE AS THIS SO COMMON AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY. AND NOT KNOWING WHAT THEY'RE A QUALIFIED FOR AND WHAT IS A BET BAILABLE FOR THEM THAT I OFTEN LOOK TO ADVOCATE FOR MY CHILD OUR OUR EDUCATE MY CHILDREN BY BY. REACHING OUT FOR RESOURCES. EVER EVER EVERY SERVICE THAT I HAVE RECEIVED. THAT IS INTENDED TO HELP MY CHILDREN IN THEIR PROGRESSION AND DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN BECAUSE I HAVE FOUGHT FOR THEM. IN MY EXPERIENCE THE SYSTEM. OPENS UP ONE TO DEMAND A NEW ADVOCATE FOR YOUR KIDS. IT SHOULD NOT BE THIS COMPLICATED. THIS AND IT SHOULD NOT REQUIRED THIS MUCH TIME ENERGY ARE HIRED HELP OF PROFESSIONAL ADVOCATES NOW THAT MY CHILDREN ARE RECEIVING A BA SERVICES BOTH ARE DOING MUCH BETTER MY SON IS THREE AND STARTING TO BE VERBAL AND THE SERVICES HAVE HELPED IN SOME OF HIS CHALLENGING BEHAVIORS. THE ENTIRE PROCESS HAS BEEN A ROLLER COASTER. THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHERE I HAVE FELT DEPRESSED. AND THAT I WAS IN A GOOD. FOR MY KIDS. IT IS HARD NOT BEING A SINGLE MOM OF CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS LET ALONE ONE WHO HAS FELT SHUT OUT OF THE SYSTEM AND I HOPE THIS COMMITTEE CAN STUDY THE PROBLEMS AND HELP FIX THE SYSTEM. SO THAT OTHER FAMILIES DO NOT HAVE TO ENTER WHAT WE HAVE IT TAKES A VILLAGE. TO RAISE OUR CHILDREN. THANK YOU FOR STARTING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU BOTH OF YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I BELIEVE YOU'VE IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO WORK ON BUT MAYBE WE'LL- TRY TO IDENTIFY SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AT THE NOW THAT MISS RAMA. RATHER MAIL YOU HAD SAID EARLIER THAT THE POLICY SEEM TO BE IN PLACE BUT WE'RE STILL. WERE STILL LACKING. WE CAN YOU EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ON THAT BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IF WE HAVE THE POLICIES OF TRY TO FIGURE OUT FROM A LEGISLATIVE PERSPECTIVE AND FROM THE LEGISLATURE LIKE WHAT MORE CAN WE DO. TO ASSIST. I THINK THE AND THERE'S ALWAYS OVER ARCHING FISCAL. CONSIDERATIONS WITH THESE SYSTEMS ESPECIALLY AS YOU KNOW POPULATION NEEDS CHANGE OVER TIME AND COSTS OF DELIVERING SERVICES CAN GO UP AND SOMETIMES THIS STATE FUNDING FOR SUCH. SERVICES DOES NOT CHANGE STAYS FLAT SAID THERE ARE THOSE. I DO THINK OF A NUMBER OF THAT I'M CHALLENGES ARE ARE FISCALLY NATURE AND THE THERE'S ALSO. THE SILOS ARE JUST A PROBLEM AND THEY THEY COME DOWN AS YOU CAN HEAR IT LIKE THAT THE CHALLENGE OF WORKING WITH. HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES OR OR MEDI CAL OR COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS ARE SOMETIMES AND THROUGH REGIONAL CENTERS MAKE BE OFFICIALLY RECEIVING THE SERVICES FROM THE REGIONAL CENTERS BUT IT'S ACTUALLY LIKE A SUB CONTRACTED. PROVIDER SO IT'S JUST A LOT OF COMPLEXITY AND THAT DOES AND IT JUST THE ELF TO. A LACK OF ALIGNMENTS AND COORDINATION AND SO FINDING SOLUTIONS THAT HELP. PROMOTE A MORE COHESIVE KIND OF THAT CENTER FAMILIES IN A WAY MORE THAN I AND- YOU KNOW KIND OF LEAVE FAMILIES TO NAVIGATE ALL THIS ON THEIR OWN EIGHT I THINK THAT THAT'S THE PLACE WHERE THE LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS MIGHT BE. YEAH I'M JUST TRYING TO CHECK THE NUMBERS BRING AND MATCH AND YOU KNOW THE LACK OF GUIDANCE AND ASSISTANCE SO. AS A PARENT WERE THEY. FIRST THE FIRST BEGAN WHERE YOU GO. PLEASE THEY HAD TOLD US TO LOOK UP WITH WARM LINE WHICH IS A PLACE THAT CAN KIND OF HELP YOU BUT UNLESS YOU KNOW ABOUT WARM LINE YOU DON'T KNOW THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT ARE OUT THERE I. WITH MY FIRST CHILD DID NOT. ENGAGE WITH WARM LINE I ISOLATEDAND I KEPT MYSELF CLOSED IN BECAUSE I WAS MOURNING. I WAS HAVING A MANY DIFFERENT EMOTIONS. AND WITH MY SECOND CHILD WITH AUTISM IT LOOKED A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE I HAVE HMO. DEAD WHEN I QUALIFIED FOR MEDI CAL IS BECAUSE MY INCOME. WAS NOT FEDERALLY A NAFF BUT IT WAS TOO MUCH TO GET ANY OTHER SERVICES. SO THAT. BECAME DIFFICULTY WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO RUN MY CHILD IN THE HOUSE NOW OUR MOLINA ARE THERE TRYING TO GIVE THEM A SPECIFIC ONE. I HAD A HMO SO THEN THEY HAD TO SAY I NEED A STRAIGHT MEDIC COW WHICH WAS FEE FOR SERVICE. SO THEN I HAD A FIGHT AND CALLED THE MEDI CAL EMBEDS MEN TO SAY HEY I NEED FEE FOR SERVICE I CAN'T. BE ENROLLED IN A HEALTH PLAN BECAUSE I HAVE A HEALTH PLAN. IS ALL I HAD TO. GET THEM TO CORRECT THAT AND THAT'S ALL TOO COMMON FOR MANY PARENTS AND- A LOT OF PARENTS GIVE UP. AND THEY. THEY JUST SAY I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. BUT I KEPT FIGHTING FOR MY CHILDREN AND THAT'S HOW I GOT THE A BA SERVICES. SOON BECAUSE I KEPT FIGHTING FOR HIM AND I REACHED OUT TO THEM MEDI CAL OMBUDSMAN SO DID YOU STOP YOUR HEALTH PLAN TO GET A NO. I TALKED TO THE MEDI CAL INVESTMENT IN ASTOR WHEN I HAD TO DO. AND THEY SAID THAT THEY NEEDED TO HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE AND THE LITTLE H. CO CODE WHICH SOMEBODY MESSED UP CLARA GLEE AT THE MEDI CAL OFFICE. AND DID NOT PUT THAT I HAD PRIVATE INSURANCE SO THAT TOOK SIX MONTHS. IT SHOULD NOT HAVE TOOK THAT LONG THEY SHOULD A HAD IT AT YOU KNOW DONE. BUT IT WAS. BATTLING AN UP HILL BATTLE. KIND OF BOB THANKS FOR PERSEVERANCE YES BUT CAN YOU DESCRIBE JUST FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE PROBABLY WATCHING WHAT IS WARM LINE ONE LINE IS A RESOURCE CENTER THAT HELPS YOU WITH I A P. IS FINDING RESOURCES FOR YOUR CHILDREN TEACHING YOU OF WHAT TO EXPECT HOW TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM AND THEY GOT A LOT OF RESOURCES THAT I WASN'T AWARE OF WITH MY FIRST CHILD WITH AUTISM. SOUNDS LIKE THEY WERE IT A VITAL LIFELINE YEAH THEY ARE. PROBABLY FOR A LOT OF PARENTS AND THOSE ABOUT SEEMING THEY HAVE THOSE RESOURCE CENTERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ARE YOU WERE JUST LUCKY TO HAVE ONE HERE I I'M NOT SURE I WOULD HOPE THEY DO I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A HERE AND I REACHED OUT TO THEM THIS YEAR. WHAT WITH MY SECOND CHILD. IN MANY COMMUNITIES DO YOU BUY IT THINGS ARE ANY THAN ACROSS THE STATE. THERE LOCAL VARIANCES ON SOMETHING WE CAN. LOOK AT. AT WHAT AGE DO PARENTS TAKE THEIR CHILD TO GET A DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE PARENTS YOU PROBABLY IDENTIFY A LITTLE BIT EARLIER BUT BEFORE IT ACTUALLY GETS DIAGNOSED YEAH I MEAN IT WHAT'S THE TYPICAL AGE THAT WE SEE MAYBE ACROSS THE STATE MAYBE I WELL I THINK THAT'S WHY THE A. P. RECOMMENDS THAT CHILDREN GET THEM REGULARLY BECAUSE THINGS CAN SHOW UP OR AND YOU KNOW DIFFERENT CHILDREN DEVELOP IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND SO YOU KNOW SEND. THAT THE IDEA THAT EVERY THREE MONTHS EVERY THREE TO SIX MONTHS AND THAT THAT FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS OF LIFE THE CHILD IS GETTING SOME SORT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS IS BEST PRACTICE AND DOT SHOULD BE OCCURRING JUST AS PART OF WELL CHILD CARE THE SAME WAY CHILDREN ARE GETTING IN THE DISEASE THEIR SCHEDULES OF IMMUNIZATIONS OR SCHEDULES OF OTHER KIND OF I'M HEARING VISION CHECKS MOTOR TAX IT'S THE IDEAS THAT IS JUST EMBEDDED INTO HEALTH CARE. AND SO THAT FAMILIES WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING ADDITIONAL THEIR PEDIATRICIAN THEIR OR THEIR PLACE OF CARE THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER WOULD BE A WHEN THEY SHOW UP FOR THE APPOINTMENT JUST HANDING THEM DEVELOPMENT OPINION THAT IDEALLY AND REVIEWING THE RESULTS WITH THEM AND TALK ABOUT IT BUT I HI. AS ANY PARENT HE'S DONE IT KNOWS IT'S NOT THAT EASY. AND SO WHAT IT SHOULD THE SCREENING STARTED BEEN RE SAYING ONE YEARS AND THEY CAN. THEY ARE DESIGNED AND THAT VALIDATED FOR DIFFERENT AGE RANGES TO DEPENDING ON THE EXACT AGE OF THE CHILD SO. THREE YEAR OR IF A CHILD IS. IN THREE MONTHS AND TWO WEEKS THERE'S A SPECIFIC SCREENING THAT THEY PULL OUT OF THE LIBRARIAN GIFT THAT IS SPECIFIC TO THAT PARTICULAR POINT OF DEVELOPMENT SO CHILDREN CAN START RECEIVING. DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS AS EARLY AS RIGHT AFTER BIRTH AND WE DO KNOW THAT CERTAIN SCREENINGS LIKE NEWBORN HEARING. ARE ADMINISTERED RIGHT AFTER BIRTH YOU KNOW SO IT'S- THE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS IT'S MORE ON. AS A LITTLE BIT LATER IN THE POSTNATAL PERIOD. YES PLEASE WHAT WE REALIZE AS A FAMILY WAS THE EYE CONTACT WITH MY DAUGHTER AND THAT'S WHEN WE BROUGHT IT UP TO THE DOCTOR BECAUSE THERE WAS NO EYE CONTACT WITH ONLY PEOPLE THAT WOULD WATCH HER. A BIT VERY MINIMAL SO THAT'S WHAT GAVE US THE WARNING SIGN I AM AND I GOT HER DIAGNOSED AT AGE TO. BETTER BUT SHE NOTICED A LOT EARLIER BUT THE DIAGNOSES AND HAPPENED FOR YEAH SHE WENT AND SMILE AT ISSUE IN THE CASE IN THE EYES. BUT THE EARLY INTERVENTION A WITH THE UC DAVIS REALLY HELPED HER A LOT. PLEASE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS. REALLY CRITICAL IN OUR CASE IS THAT THE SYMPTOMS THAT SHE WAS EXHIBITING MORE SUBTLE ENOUGH AND I'VE READ THAT THIS IS COMMON IN GIRLS NOT ISM THAT THE SYMPTOMS DON'T MATCH THE STEREO TYPE AND SO IS PEOPLE ARE REVIEWING THIS. TOOL IT'S BASICALLY A CHECKLIST OF THE PIECE OF PAPER YOU FILL OUT THE FORM. I WITH ALL THE OTHER FORMS ARE FILLING OUT IN THE WAITING ROOM AND- IN OKAY SO FOR EXAMPLE SHE WOULD POINT. BUT NOW I LOOK BACK AND I SEE OTHER PEOPLE'S KIDS AND THEY'RE PLAYING AND EVERYTHING AND THEY'RE MAD AT YOU IF YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT THEM. MY DAUGHTER NEVER DID THAT BUT SHE PLEADED SOMETIMES. AND SO WE'VE CHECKED IT AS YEAH SHE POINTS AT THINGS WHEN REALLY. I KNOW NOW SHE DIDN'T POINT AT THINGS THE WAY OTHER KIDS DO AND SHE REALLY WAS MUCH MORE WITHDRAWN THAN OTHER KIDS AND LESS INTERESTED IN HER ENVIRONMENT THAN OTHER KIDS. BUT IT WAS SUBTLY ENOUGH THAT WITHOUT. WITH AN UNTRAINED EYE. AND WITHOUT THIS DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING IMPLEMENTED BY SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT TO LOOK FOR AND KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE. IT WAS MISSED. SO HOW CAN WE EXPANDER. SEEMS LIKE WE NEED TO EDUCATE PEOPLE TO LOOK FOR THE SIGNS. I MEAN WHAT DO WE HAVE. THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF IN THE STATE PROGRAMS THAT DO THAT I KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT I TEND YOU WILL HEAR LATER IN THE PANEL FROM HOME GROWN ONE OF THAT ONE OF THE KEY TENETS OF THE HELP ME GROW APPROACH IS ACTUALLY EDUCATING HEALTH PROVIDERS AND EDUCATIONAL PROVIDERS ON CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND ABOUT DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. IN AND EAT IN A PERFECT WORLD A CHILD WOULDN'T BE RECEIVING ONE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING FROM ONE PERSON ONLY YOU TO EAT YOU REALLY WOULD HAVE LIKE AT THE HEAD IN HEAD STARTS CHILDREN RECEIVE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS FROM THEIR TEACHERS AND THEIR PARENTS AND THEN THEY COMPARE. AND THEY TALK AND NOT REALLY WOULD BE YOU KNOW I MEAN IT IF WE COULD CREATE HADN'T CONDITIONS THAT WOULD IT THAT WILL MAKE THAT HAPPEN FOR EVERY FAMILY THAT WOULD REALLY BE IDEAL. AND. SO YEAH BUT THAT THE EDUCATION AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT HAVING PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAINED IN DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS AND I AND YOU KNOW ABLE TO HELP PARENTS US OUT EXACTLY LIKE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN DID YOU POINT FIVE OUT OF TEN TIMES. AND THAT THAT IS KEY AND AT HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY AS YOU EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WORK FORCE. SO. THANK YOU. AND SO EARLIER I FORGET SOMEONE MENTIONED PARENTS DROPPING OFF BECAUSE IT JUST GOT SO DIFFICULT WHAT AGE DO WE USUALLY SEE THAT AND- JUST TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE HELP. AT AGE THREE AT AGE THREE YEAH A LOT OF TIMES ALL TO REGIONAL WILL BACK OFF AND SAY THAT THEY DO NOT QUALIFY FOR SERVICES THEY TRIED TO DO THAT WITH MY DAUGHTER. I HAD TO GO TO A PANEL AND SAY THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE I HAD TO LET THEM KNOW THAT SHE WAS RUNNING OUT IN THE STREET. ARE TAKING OFF OUT OF THE HOUSE AND TELLING THEM HEY THE LATTER MEN ACCESS YOU HAVE TO HELP MY CHILD TO THE SHE'S EIGHTEEN SO I'VE FOUGHT FOR THOSE SERVICES. ALSO I TRY TO FIGHT AND EDUCATE MYSELF AND LOOK FOR RESOURCES THAT ARE OUT THERE LIKE PARENT TRAINING OUR PARENT ADVOCATE SO THAT I COULD ADVOCATE FOR MY CHILD. BUT NOT ALL PARENTS ARE AS EAGER. AS ME BECAUSE THEY YOU DO GET DEPRESSED YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NOT ENOUGH FOR YOUR CHILD. AND THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO. FIGHT WHAT THEY WHAT THEY MYSELF BECAUSE I WANT THE BEST FOR THEM. ON THE POLICY JUST THE NATURE OF THE EARLY START SYSTEM AND I SHOULD HAVE CLARIFIED THIS AND IN THE REMARKS I PROVIDED IT'S EARLY START SERVES CHILDREN UNTIL AND- THEIR TWO YEARS NINE MONTHS AT WHICH POINT THE TRANSITION TO THE PART B. OF THE INDIVIDUAL SAYS PLEASE I. EDUCATION ACT WHICH IN CALIFORNIA IS IMPLEMENTED THROUGH LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES AND IS PART OF THE K. TWELVE SPECIAL EDUCATION SYSTEM SO. A THREE YEAR OLD ARE STILL VERY LITTLE BUT THEIR PARENTS ARE THEY THEY NATURE THERE'S A BIFURCATION BETWEEN. THE ID A SERVICES FOR CHILDREN THAT ARE UNDER THREE AND THOSE THAT ARE OVER PASSED THEIR THIRD BIRTHDAY. YEAH I'M JUST YEAH YEAH BE THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW YEP YOUR PARENTS THAT ARE EAGER SOME OF THAT WORK FOR FIRST FIVE IT'S TAKEN THIS LONG TO GET DIAGNOSED ON. THINKING ABOUT THE THOUSANDS OF OTHER FAMILIES THAT. YOU KNOW DON'T HAVE THAT SUPPORTER DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND HOW MUCH LATER THAT DIAGNOSIS IS COMING COMPARED TO WE DO INTERVENING EARLY JUST MAKES A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE FOR THE OUTCOMES I KNOW ASSEMBLY WOMAN SMITH HAS A- QUESTION PLEASE. THANK YOU TO BOTH OF YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND I HAVE SAID NGUYEN OTHER PARENTS COME TO US IN SACRAMENTO THE MOST FEARS ADVOCACY IS THE WORK THAT YOU DO ON BEHALF OF YOUR OWN CHILDREN AND CLEARLY BOTH OF YOU HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT. THE BEAUTY OF YOUR HARD WORK THOUGH IS THAT NOW THAT WILL TRANSLATE TO BENEFITS FOR OTHER CHILDREN STATEWIDE SO WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND TELLING YOUR STORIES WHICH I KNOW ARE VERY PERSONAL. AND STILL PRESENT CHALLENGES BECAUSE ANY PARENT OF A SPECIAL NEEDS CHILD LIVES WITH A LIFELONG. ADDED CHALLENGE AS A PARENT SO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE ON BEHALF OF ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S KIDS. AND THAT BEING SAID THE TEACHING YOU MENTIONED HIRING AN ADVOCATE AND THIS IS ONE POLICY AREA I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS FIRST OF ALL IN THIS ADVOCACY SPACE. RATES THAT FAMILIES ARE CHARGED RANGE HUGH DRAMATICALLY AND HUGELY AND IN SOME INSTANCES FAMILIES ARE REALLY BEING WELL SERVED BY THE ADVOCACY COMMUNITY SO IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND GOING INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ON. HOW YOU FOUND YOUR ADVOCATE IT DID YOU FEEL THAT THE SERVICES WERE BENEFICIAL BEYOND WHAT YOU WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE ON YOUR OWN AND WHAT POLICY EVERYTHING'S WOULD YOU RECOMMEND IN IN SPACE OKAY WELL I GOT AN ARABIC. BECAUSE I FELL I HAD SO MUCH GOING ON IN HAVING TWO CHILDREN THAT HAVE AUTISM LIKE I SAID I HAVE THREE CHILDREN HAVE ANDREW WHO'S NINE. AM HE'S A TYPICAL GROWING CHILD BUT I HAVE TO ARTISTIC CHILDREN AND I WAS DEALING WITH MY DAUGHTER WHO SEVEN. IN DEALING WITH HER IP AND THEN I HAVE BRANDON WHOSE NEWLY DIAGNOSED AND I HAD HIS IP AND I DIDN'T FEEL PREPARED ENOUGH ARE THAT I WAS READY FOR THAT MEETING. BECAUSE SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE THEY DISTRICT GROUP THE I EP TOGETHER THEY TAKE OUT THE NAME IT DON'T INDIVIDUALIZE IT TO THAT CHILD AS. WELL SO I SAID OKAY LET ME GET AT ADVOCATE. EXPERIENCE WITH THAT THE KID WAS HORRIBLE. I PAID A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS TO HAVE HER COME IN AND RUIN THE I EP SHE PUT THE IP ON HOLD AS YOU PUT IT OFF FOR A WEEK. I FIRED HER. I SAID THIS IS NOT HOW I'M GONNA REPRESENT MYSELF WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BE TAKING CARE OF MY CHILD. AND IT FELT TO ME LIKE IT WAS ABOUT MONEY THAT SHE WANTED TO PUSH IT OFF SO THAT SHE CAN GET PAID MORE. I WISH I WOULD HAVE DONE MY RESEARCH I WAS GIVING HER HER NAME BY I WORK IN A HOSPITAL. BY A PATIENT THAT I OOK CARE OF HER MOTHER SAID THIS IS A GREAT ADVOCATE SHE WILL GET THE SERVICES FOR YOUR CHILD SO I JUST WENT OFF OF WHAT A PARENT HAD TOLD ME. AND IT WAS THE WORST EXPERIENCE THAT I HAD. BUT MOVING FORWARD I FEEL THAT I'M STRONG ENOUGH TO ADVOCATE FOR MY CHILD NOW I GET PARENTS CHAINING THROUGH UC DAVIS WHICH IS A FREE SERVICE. I REACH OUT AND I TRY TO EDUCATE MYSELF AS MUCH AS I CAN SO THAT I AM ADVOCATING FOR MY CHILD. AND IF I FELT THAT I NEEDED WHEN I WOULD DEFINITELY DO A LOT MORE RESEARCH. ARE REACHING OUT TO WARM LINE M. MORE NOW. DID I ANSWER EVERYTHING PLACE. I ALSO HIRED AN ADVOCATE FOR AND- LIVING IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND I PAID MORE I PAID ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS TOTAL. I FOUND HER TO BE OF VALUE SHE DID ASSIST ME WITH A NUMBER OF THINGS BUT THEY WERE A FEW THINGS. MOST OF WHAT SHE DID I COULD HAVE HANDLED MYSELF AND QUITE FRANKLY IF SOMEBODY HAD SAT ME DOWN AND GIVEN ME TRAINING ON HOW TO NAVIGATE THE IEP PROCESS WHO WASN'T PART OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT YOU KNOW THE SCHOOL DISTRICT GIVES YOU THEIR YEAR. YOU KNOW PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS AND ALL OF THE THINGS THAT REQUIRED ILLEGALLY DAVID. THE REALITY IS THEY HAVE A FINANCIAL DISINCENTIVE TO ASSIST YOU IN GETTING EVERYTHING THAT YOU NEED SO YOU DO HAVE TO GO IN AN ADVOCATE. I'VE HAD. JUST AS MUCH SUCCESS WORKING ABOUT IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY KNOW AND THEY WORK WITH AN ORGANIZATION CALLED DRIED OFF. AND THEY- ARE NONPROFIT THEY TRAIN PARENTS FOR FREE ONLINE PROCESS AND I'VE GOTTEN. JUST AS GOOD OF JUST IN EQUALLY HOPEFUL INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT FROM THEM THAT I PAID EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR AND I WAS FORTUNATE THAT I HAD THE MEANS THAT I COULD DO THAT BUT- MOST PARENTS DON'T. IN EITHER OF YOUR CASES WHERE THE ADVOCATES THAT YOU SELECTED AFFILIATED WITH A LAW FIRM THAT SPECIALIZES IN THIS TYPE OF WORK NOW. I DON'T KNOW THAT MY ADVOCATE WAS AFFILIATED WITH A LAW FIRM BUT I HAPPENED AT THAT TIME TO WORK FOR THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY BAR ASSOCIATION AND I RECEIVED A REFERRAL TO HER THROUGH A LAWYER. OKAY THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY WOMAN GOMEZ REYES PLEASE THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU KNOW ONE OF THE COMMENTS YOU MADE WAS THE BEGINNING ESPECIALLY THE TO YOU FELT DEPRESSED AND FELT THAT YOU WERE NOT ENOUGH I WANTED TO KNOW YOU ARE ENOUGH NOT ONLY FOR YOUR CHILDREN BUT FOR THE OTHER CHILDREN WHO JUST AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH SAID THERE'S SO MANY OF THE CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BENEFIT BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN ENOUGH FOR YOUR CHILDREN AND THAT HAS SPILLED OUT TO FOR SO MANY OTHERS SO THANK YOU BOTH FOR SHARING THAT. IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ARE YOUR INPUT THE END IN THIS TYPE OF A HEARING OR THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION IT'S THE PARENTS TESTIMONY THAT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT PLEASE I WANTED TO COMMENT TO CHILDREN NOW THE WORK THAT YOU ALL HAVE DONE HAS BEEN PHENOMENAL AND EVE FOR US AS LEGISLATORS HAVING A PARTNERS LIKE LIKE THE ORGANIZATION IS IMPORTANT TO OUR WORK HAVING YOU TALK TO US ABOUT THE ISSUES. EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE SOLUTIONS BUT TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED THEN PROVIDES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO THEN LOOK TO WHAT THE POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS. CAN BE. IT DOES CONCERN ME TREMENDOUSLY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. THE FACT THAT ONLY 43% OF SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN RECEIVE THE ASSISTANCE THEY SHOULD RECEIVE. HOW DO WE FIX THAT WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO. BEYOND POLICY AND OF COURSE THEN WE HAVE THE BUDGET BUT WHAT MORE CAN WE DO THAT YOU CAN SEE FROM YOUR VANTAGE POINT. THANK YOU EIGHT CONCERNS ALL OF US AND I THINK THAT THAT'S. STATE THEY BE LARGER THAN FOURTEEN OTHER STATES IN THE U. S. THAT'S HOW MANY BABIES WE HAVE HERE AND SO IT'S AN ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY I THINK FOR POLICYMAKERS AND I'M JUST I'M I'M SO GRATEFUL TO LEGISLATURE FOR CONTINUING TO PAY ATTENTION. TO THE YOUNGEST CHILDREN THEIR FAMILIES AND YOU KNOW IT'S THE SOLUTIONS ARE TO BE MULTI FACETED THESE ARE COMPLEX SYSTEMS THERE'S HISTORICAL BUT HE- CHALLENGES AND IT'S REALLY GOING TO TAKE PEOPLE COMING TOGETHER AND HASHING THINGS OUT AND- YOU KNOW TALKING IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A PACKAGE PROBABLY AS- DIFFERENT POLICY IN BUDGETARY SOLUTIONS BUT I DO THINK THAT. THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION REPORT. BOB WILL HELP TO GET A FAIR AND ADDITIONALLY SOME OF THE PROGRAM YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT LIKE HELP HELP ME GROW LEADER IN SOME OF THE- CHALLENGES AROUND THE CURRENT CHALLENGES AROUND THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM. THERE MAY BE SOME THINGS WE CAN DO I'M MORE NEAR TERM. THAT WILL THAT WILL HELP I'M I'M HAPPY TO. HAVE A FOUR FIVE HOUR CONVERSATION WITH YOU AS WELL. ANY OTHER TIME ABOUT NOW. TALKED ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT WERE FISCAL IN NATURE YOU TALKED ABOUT THE SILOS. CENTERING FAMILIES AND THAT NAVIGATING THE SYSTEM HAVING ADVOCATES I WONDER. IT THERE IS A BILL THAT IS PENDING EIGHTY SIX OUT OF TO PROVIDE FOR AID NEW DEPARTMENT OR A NEW FOCUS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. AND I HAPPEN TO BE THE AUTHOR OF. BUT THE BUT THE IT CAME NOT AS A RESULT OF MY BEING SUCH A BRILLIANT LEGISLATOR ALTHOUGH I THINK THAT I AM BUT- IT REALLY CAME AS A RESULT OF THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION. OUT AFTER TWO YEARS OF ALL OF THIS WORK WITH THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION THERE WERE A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND WHEN WE HAVE THE SILOS AND DON'T TALK TO EACH OTHER THAT IS A PROBLEM AND THAT WAS BROUGHT UP BY THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION. AND THAT'S PART OF THE REASON THAT WE WANT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT. MAYBE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A BRANCH BUT IT'S GOING TO BE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. SPECIFICALLY SO THAT ALL OF THE SILOS ARE TALKING TO EACH OTHER SO THAT WHEN THE PARENTS. TRY TO GET HELP THAT THERE'S AT AS THEY'VE SAID IN SO MANY OTHER AREAS THERE'S NO WRONG DOOR. HOWEVER YOU COME INTO THE SYSTEM ASKING FOR ASSISTANCE. YOU WILL THEN BE DIRECTED TO WHOEVER. WHOEVER OR WHATEVER DEPARTMENT CAN HELP YOU BEST. IN AGAIN I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF THE INPUT FROM FROM THE ORGANIZATION. AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU THANK YOU MAYBE WE'LL USE THAT AS A GOOD SEGUE TO THEN BRING UP NOW THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION AND THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS THANK YOU. FOR YOUR TESTIMONY FOR BEING HERE THIS MORNING LET'S GO AND BRING OUT HERE. OUR SECOND PANEL WHICH IS NANCY STROLL WITH THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION AND TANYA MCMILLAN. THIS IS SPEAKERS BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION THANK YOU GUYS FOR BEING HERE THIS MORNING. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION THANK YOU. SO OKAY PLEASE BEGIN. FIRST I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GóMEZ AS FAR SO ELOQUENTLY EXPLAINING WHAT WE DID ON THE COMMISSION SO THANK YOU FOR THAT SO I'M TANIA MCMILLAN AND I'M ONE OF THE COMMISSIONERS ON THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION I'M ALSO A FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDER FROM THE CITY OF BELLFLOWER TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I'VE BEEN PROVIDING QUALITY CARE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND I'M A MEMBER OF SEIU LOCAL NINETY NINE. SO I WANTED TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE AS A PROVIDER WORKING WITH CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS AND MY HEART GOES OUT TO THE TWO PARENTS WHO WERE JUST HERE BECAUSE I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH. ONE MIGHT GET ME MOTIONAL SORRY. A LOT OF TIMES WHEN PEOPLE MENTION SPECIAL NEEDS YOUR MIND AUTOMATICALLY DOES GO TO AUTISM BUT I CARED FOR A LITTLE GIRL WHO HAD A CLEFT PALATE. THAT'S THE IT YOU REALLY DON'T THINK ABOUT THESE OTHER SPECIAL NEEDS THAT FAMILIES NEED HER GRANDMOTHER FOUND HERSELF AS THE GUARDIAN OF HER. OWN WHEN SHE CAME TO MY CHILD HERE OF COURSE HER FACE IS DIFFERENT AND SO ALL THE OTHER CHILDREN ARE MAKING COMMENTS ABOUT IT AND SO IT IT. PUT ME IN A VERY I'M GONNA SAY REWARDING POSITION. BECAUSE I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TEACH THE OTHER CHILDREN IN MY CHILD CARE ENVIRONMENT. THAT APRIL WAS NO DIFFERENT THAN THEY WERE. I HELPED HER MOTHER NAVIGATE HER WAY THROUGH THE RED TAPE THROUGH THE REGIONAL CENTER. GET AND HURT HER CHILD CARE TO THE RESOURCE AND REFERRAL AGENCY SHE HAD HER SPEECH THERAPIST COME TO MY CHILD CARE TO COME WORK WITH APRIL AND THE OTHER KIDS GOT TO SEE THAT. SO IT WAS IT WAS AN AMAZING TIME BED. IT'S MORE THAN JUST AUTISM I ALSO HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE THE FIRST PERSON TO RECOGNIZE THAT ONE OF MY LITTLE ONES. I BELIEVE WAS ON THE SPECTRUM AND HE WAS. THE AUTISM SPECTRUM YOU CAN EITHER BE MILDLY AUTISTIC OR SEVERELY ARTISTIC. AND ONE OF THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IT AT SEIU LOCAL NINETY NINE IS WE HAVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH SPECIAL NEEDS IN THAT WORK. AND WE DO THESE WORKSHOPS AND WE INVITE ALL OF OUR PROVIDERS TO COME AND WE'RE TAUGHT ON SITE SIGNS TO LOOK FOR HAVEN'T A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION WITH PARENTS TELLING THEM THAT THERE'S SOMETHING. DIFFERENT ABOUT THEIR CHILD GIVING THEM RESOURCES AND FOLKS A CONTACT AND VOLUNTEERING TO HELP THEM NAVIGATE THEIR WAY THROUGH A SYSTEM THAT CLEARLY NEEDS TO BE REFORMED. I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH ANOTHER LITTLE GIRL WHO WE THOUGHT WAS JUST SEVERELY SHY IT TURNED OUT SHE HAD SELECTED MUTISM. WHICH MEANS. SHE WOULD NOT TALK TO ANYONE. AND NOT IT WAS ALMOST LIKE BEING AFRAID TO SPEAK SO I'M I'M SHARING DIFFERENT. SPECIAL NEEDS THAT ME AS A PROVIDER I WASN'T EQUIPPED FOR THIS WHEN I GOT MY LICENSE. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE CHILDREN BUT THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT I HAD TO LEARN AND WORK WITH. IN MY CHILD CARE ENVIRONMENT. IT'S SOME IT'S REALLY SAD BECAUSE THAT THE SYSTEM IT REALLY IS CONFUSING AND FRUSTRATING. AND DIFFICULT FOR PARENTS WHO ARE ARE ALREADY TRYING TO DEAL WITH. FIRST LEARNING THAT THEIR CHILD. HAS A SPECIAL NEED OR A DISABILITY BUT I THANK GOD THAT I ENDED UP BEING LIKE A PERSON WHO CAN BE THERE AS A SUPPORT. BUT NOT EVERY CHILD CARE PROVIDER OR CHILD CARE CENTER. HAS THE ABILITY TO DO THAT AND THEN IT'S REALLY SAD THE ONCE THEY LEAVE MY CHILD HERE AND NOW THEY'RE ENTERING INTO K. THROUGH TWELVE THEY HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH THESE HOPES ALL OVER AGAIN. THERE THAT'S A PROBLEM AND SO I'M REALLY THANKFUL THAT MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS AND LEGISLATORS WHO WERE ON THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION THAT WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING WE LEFT NO STONE. UNTURNED COVERED IN OUR CONVERSATION AND WE DID IT OUTLINES SOME RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADDRESS THAT NOT ENOUGH THOUGH AND SO LIKE I SAID I APPLAUD THE PEER TO CAMBER BECAUSE I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE DEALING WITH. AND I'M GONNA HAND THE BATON OVER TO NANCY BECAUSE I'LL JUST PLAY HOCKEY. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT TESTIMONY WAS GOOD INTO MOVED TO MISS. THANK YOU I'M ONE OF RECOGNIZE THE TWO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION WHO ARE WITH THAT'S THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY AND- GOT HIS RAMOS AND I NOTICED THAT YOU BOTH SMILED WHEN TINY SAID WE LEFT NO STONE UNTURNED. I'M AND AGAIN I WANTED JUST REPEAT I THINK WHAT YOU SAID SO ELOQUENTLY ASSEMBLY WOMAN. GOMEZ REYES AND THAT IS. THAT FOR THE TWO PARENTS WHO SPOKE THEY ARE. ENOUGH AND NOT FOR THE CHILDREN OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS THEIR OWN CHILDREN. AND A REAL BASIS OF ALL OF THE WORK BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION WERE STRONG INPUT FROM PARENTS AND IS THE SAME WAY YOUR HEARING IS BASED A LOT ON BOTH THE RESEARCH THAT CHILDREN NOW PRESENTED IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS WILL PRESENT. AND THE PROGRAMS THAT WILL DISCUSS IN THE THIRD PANEL REALLY THE COURT A LOT OF FOR ALL OF US WHO REMEMBER WHEN WE LEAVE ARE THE TWO PARENTS. AND TIME HIS EXPERIENCES AS A PROVIDER AND THAT WAS PART OF OUR BASIS AS WELL. WE ALSO I THINK IT'S SO IN. WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT BREAKING DOWN SILOS WHEN WE STARTED THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION WE COULD HAVE STOPPED JESS TO CHILD CARE I GUESS YOU COULD STILL DO THAT. BUT WE REALIZE YOU CAN'T BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS THE WELL BEING OF CHILDREN AND FUTURE CALIFORNIA. AND MAKING SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE CHILD CAN FEEL FILLED THEIR POTENTIAL SO THE DAY CAN ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR FULL POTENTIAL TO OUR STATE SO IT'S REALLY CRITICAL. THAT WE NOT LOOK AT SILOS AND WE TALKED A LOT IN OUR REPORT WHICH AS YOU CAN SEE IS VERY LONG. IT WAS HARD TO EXCERPTED. ABOUT SOME CULTURE CHANGES THAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FACT THAT WE KNOW SO MUCH MORE THAN WE USED TO ABOUT INTERVENTION. WE KNOW SO MUCH MORE THAN WE USED TO ABOUT IDENTIFICATION. AND WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS TAKE THE SUCCESSFUL SERVICE MODELS WE HAVE. TAKE THE SYSTEMS WE HAVE THAT TOUCH CHILDREN AND REALLY BREAK DOWN THE SILOS AND CHANGE THE CULTURES FROM A CULTURE OF COMPLIANCE AND RULES. TO A WELCOMING CULTURE SELECT SAID THE WARM LINE IS OUR MODEL NOT SEVENTEENTH PAGE FORMS TO SEE IF YOU'RE ONE DOLLAR OVER. ONE QUARTER OF THIS YEAR TO GET SERVICES AND SO WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THAT AND NOT. THAT WE DON'T HAVE A VERY STRONG EMPHASIS ON FOCUSING ON THOSE MOST IN NEED THOSE WHO ARE LOW INCOME LOOKING AT DISCRIMINATION. BUT DOING THAT ALL WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF TRUSTING AND LISTENING PARENTS AND BREAKING DOWN SILOS. SO JUST TO LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I WOULD COMMEND PEOPLE READ OUR WHOLE REPORT REALLY NICE. OVERRIDE OR GOING INTO IT. BUT ALSO I THINK IT'S SAD. YOU CAN LOOK AT HOW THINGS FIT TOGETHER AS WELL AS THE INDIVIDUAL WHAT'S SO OUR FIRST SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS HAD TO DO THAT THE QUALITY IS NOT EQUITY. SO YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF PEOPLE BINDING EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES YOU KNOW WE CAN SAY WELL ANYONE CAN FIND A REGIONAL CENTER BUT THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT GO INTO IT IN TERMS OF FAMILY'S EXPERIENCES FAMILIES ACCESS TO RESOURCES. A MEDICAL HOME AND SO YOU HAVE TO REALLY SPOKE FOCUS ON SPECIAL KINDS OF. BARRIERS THAT FAMILIES HAVE AS WELL AS SPECIAL STRENGTHS THAT FAMILIES HAVE ON. AND RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND POVERTY AND RURAL AREA YOU KNOW THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT THINGS AND WE FOCUSED ON ALL OF THOSE. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT LOOK AT EARLY INTERVENTION CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES IT'S IMPORTANT WE LOOK AT THE BIG UNIVERSAL GOALS IF IN FACT. EVERYONE WENT TO TINY IS CHILD CARE OR IS CENTER% WITH TRAINING AND CONNECTION TO SERVICES AND WE HAD UNIVERSAL ACCESS LIKE WE TALK ABOUT THAT'S OUR GOAL OF UNIVERSAL ACCESS OF EVERYONE TO CHILD CARE. THERE WOULD BE NO AND A WHOLE OTHER SET OF EYES AND EXPERTISE THAT WOULD LOOK AT EARLY INTERVENTION. IF YOU ALSO LOOK AT ONE OF OUR OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH IS IN A P. EMERGENCY SERVICES BY WHICH IS TO BRING IT WAS KIDS KIDS IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. THOSE APPLY FOR REFUGEE STATUS AND THOSE FACING DISLOCATION BECAUSE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BRING THOSE RIGHT INTO THE CHILD CARE SYSTEM WITH NO WAITING LISTS. THAT ALSO WOULD BE ANOTHER SET OF EYES LOOKING AT EARLIER BATCHES. SO MANY OF OUR UNIVERSAL CHILD CARE RECOMMENDATIONS. WOULD REALLY BENEFIT CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES.WELL IT VERY STRONGLY STATE RIGHT UP FRONT IS ONE OF OUR UNIVERSAL GOALS IS TO INSURE THAT EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF ALL CHILDREN BY IMPLEMENTING COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEMS AND INTEGRATING IT INTO ECT AS WELL IF YOU CAN'T HAVE IDENTIFICATION WITHOUT SERVICES ACCESS IS REALLY LOOKING AT THOSE SO THAT UNIVERSAL SERVICES IS ACCOMPANIED BY ACCESS TO SERVICE AND GET OUR NEXT PANEL WILL REALLY TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE SUCCESSFUL A SERVICE MODELS AND WHAT THOSE COULD COULD MEAN TO KIDS WE WANT TO REALLY EXPAND THE CHILD BUYING PROGRAM SO THAT WE ARE OF PERMITTED THE LOOKING FOR KIDS THAT NEED SERVICES. AND NOT HAVING PARENTS GO THROUGH ALL OF THESE BARRIERS. AND EXPAND THE CAPACITY OF EARLY START AN ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION SO THAT IT'S NOT% WAS A STAFFER WORKED ON SOME OF THOSE DEFINITIONS. AND YOU DO NEED DEFINITIONS BUT YOU ALSO NEED TO HAVE LIKE A KIND OF DEFINITION SO THAT YOU COULD REALLY INCLUDE KIDS. THAT WILL MOST BENEFIT FROM EARLY INTERVENTION. WE WANT TO ESTABLISH A TASK FORCE TO LOOK AT ALL THESE DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES YOU KNOW THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS AT THE STATE LEVEL THERE'S FEDERAL THEIR STATE. IN REALLY REMOVE THE BARRIERS LEADING TO THE DELAY TRANSITION BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT THREE IS A BARRIER BECAUSE OF SOMETHING INHERENT IN THE CHILDREN IT'S INHERENT IN OUR- SYSTEM. IN THE TRANSITION THAT HAS TO GET MADE AND ALSO TO BRIDE AND SOME OF THE CURRENT LEGAL DEFINITIONS SO THAT WE CAN REALLY CAPTURE ALL THE CHILDREN THEY CAN. CAN DO THIS ELIMINATE THE RACIAL DISPARITIES THAT CHILDREN NOW TALKING ABOUT AND ADD ALSO SUBMITTED THIS PORT PERSONALITY AND DISCIPLINE PRACTICES BUT DON'T RECOGNIZE. A SOME OF THE CHALLENGES BASED ON SPECIAL NEEDS BUT RATHER DO LOOK AT IT FOR THAT I DISCIPLINE. SORT OF YOU THIS WAS VERY FAST IN TERMS OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT I DO THINK WITHIN THE REPORT AS WELL AS BECAUSE OF YOUR MEMBERS THAT WERE SO INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALL OF THESE. THEY'RE BOTH VERY SPECIFIC IDEAS FOR THINGS WE COULD DO LIKE EXPAND CHILD BY AS WELL AS REALLY. LOOKING AT BROADER IT KIND OF THE BROADER SYSTEM AND HOW WE CAN INTEGRATE THAT ALSO VERY HAPPY TO SAY THAT IN THE BUDGET THAT WAS PASSED INSIDE OUR- OUR ADVISORY COMMITTEE WHICH IS. WHICH HAS STRONG COMPARING AND PROVIDERS SUB COMMITTEES TWITCH CAN GUIDE AND ADVISE THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR AND THE SUPERINTENDENT. INTEGRATED WAY I AND ALL OF THE. SEASON HERE THE VOICES SO THAT WE DO BREAK DOWN THE SILOS AND LOOK AT UNIVERSAL AS WELL AS THE PARTICULARITIES. IS IN THE BUDGET IS PASSED. AND WILL BE A REALITY AS WE LOOK TOWARDS THE KIND OF SYSTEM CHANGE THAT YOU ALL HAVE TAKEN SAID TO LEADERSHIP ON INITIATING. AB ONE THING PLEASE PLEASE JUST. IN THE IN THE WORK FORCE THE PROFESSIONALS WHO WORK WITH THESE CHILDREN THEY'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH THESE CHILDREN I THINK WE RECOMMENDED ALSO MAYBE NOT IN THESE WORDS THESE TERMS BUT REALLY WORKING ON A WAY ON RETAINING THOSE FOLKS IN BRINGING MORE FOLKS IN WHO WANT TO DO THIS WORK THIS WORK IS SO. PRECIOUS AND SO VALUABLE AND SO CRITICAL BUT THAT WORK FORCE DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE COMPENSATED AND APPRECIATE IT FOR WHAT THEY BRING TO THE TABLE TO. CUT YEAH BECAUSE WE HEARD EVEN EARLIER HOW IMPORTANT HAVING THAT GUIDANCE AND IS TO ACTUALLY NAVIGATING EVERYTHING THERE'S A LOT OF RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE B. R. C. REPORTED I KNOW SOME OF OUR MEMBERS ARE REALLY FAMILIAR WITH THAT. BUT HOW DO WE PRIORITIZE LIKE YOU KNOW THE FOR REALLY GETTING OUT EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES IS IT LOOKING AT THE RACIAL DISPARITIES THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED IS AT LOOKING AT IS IT ALL JUST FUNDING IS IT. TRYING TO FIND THE ADVOCATES OF MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE COMPENSATED AND DIRECTING PEOPLE THE RIGHT WAY HOW DO WE BEGIN TO TACKLE THAT ISSUE IT JUST. MAYBE YOUR PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION IS HOW DO WE- WHERE SHE WOULD START. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS DIRECTED TO HEAR. I'M WELL I SPEAK FOR MYSELF I WAS LAZY CONSULTED I'VE BEEN A STAFFER I WAS AN ADVOCATE I'VE- BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME IF YOU CAN TELL. AND I THINK THAT WE'RE STARTING IN THE RIGHT PLACE WHEN I SAID THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND SENATOR ZELL ADVISORY COMMITTEES REPORTS THAT IT THAT. BUT I THINK THAT ALL THE AERATION AND BREAKING DOWN THE SILOS AT THE YEAH RACING DOWN THE SILOS IT'S LOOKING AT STARTING WITH THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. ADD NOT STARTING WITH THE NEEDS OF BUDGET OR FEDERAL REGULATIONS I'M AND I THINK CALIFORNIA HAS REALLY BEEN A LEADER IN THAT I MEAN A LOT OF THE WORK THAT WE DO AND WHAT YOU'LL SEE DESCRIBED IN THE NEXT PANEL WE REALLY HAVE BILL PROGRAMS BASED IN THAT KIND OF WAY AND SO I WOULD SAY. THAT LOOKING OVERALL SYSTEMICALLY SO THAT WE ARE TAKING THIS INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY WITH THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE HAVE BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE I WORKED IN BOTH. AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENT TO THESE KIND OF ISSUES THAT I WILL LEAVE ASIDE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY. MY PERSONAL OPINION. THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY. MAKE CHANGE AND BREAK DOWN SILOS AND LOOK OVER OUR BIG GOALS. AS WELL AS WORKING ON VERY SPECIFIC SMALLER GOALS LIKE IF WE CHANGE CHILD FINE AND DID SOME OF THE CHANGES IN THE TRANSITION. BETWEEN THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IF WE LOOK AT RACIAL YOU KNOW CONTINUE SOME OF THE RESEARCH THIS GOD ON ABOUT WHY ARE YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THESE DISPARITIES BASED IN HOW COULD WE THROUGH THE CHILD BY PROGRAM IN OTHER WAYS. THROUGH MEDI CAL CHANGES MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS BETTER ACCESS ACROSS ALL THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND I ALSO THINK. THAT THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE FOR THE EMERGENCY CHILD CARE FOR THE KIDS WHO ARE CONNECTED VESTED PILOTS WHO ARE HOMELESS REFUGEE STATUS. IF WE REALLY COULD. NET CHILDREN WITH SYSTEMS EARLIER THAT ARE THE MOST IN NEED THAT WOULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE SO THOSE WOULD BE SOME INITIAL BUT YOU KNOW THERE ARE MANY MORE THAT YOU ALL. HERE AT EVERY SMALL PIECE THAT WE DO MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE IN SOME CHILDREN'S LIVES AS WELL AS OUR OVERALL VISION AND REALLY COMMITTING TO CHANGE THAT THAT'S A AND DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW TODAY. MAKING OURSELVES AVAILABLE FOR YOU TO ASK QUESTIONS AND HAVING PARENTS COME IN AND TALK DIRECTLY. TO YOU SO YOU CAN REALLY GET UNDERSTAND AND ABOUT THE NEED THIS THERE. THAT IS ANOTHER THING TO DO AND ALSO THERE IS THIS THERE'S A. WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO REMOVE THE STIGMA. THAT PARENTS MAY FEEL SHARING THIS. IT'S VERY HARD TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS AND THEN TO COME AND YOU'RE ON. A TV SCREEN AND YOUR SHARE THIS PERSONAL. HEARTFELT TO GET OVER THAT FEAR TO REALITY EXACTLY REMOVING THAT THAT THAT'S ANOTHER BEGINNING. BELIEVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY JEFF QUESTION. YES I DID BUT BUT BEFORE THAT JUST WANTED TO THINK TONYA WITH ONE OF OUR THAT. STRONG MEMBERS ALWAYS SAYS PARTICIPATED BUT ALSO MAKE SURE SHE BROUGHT THE PERSPECTIVE FROM THE COMMUNITY OUT THERE TO OUR FIFTEEN MISLEADING YOU AGAIN. SO I HAD THE HONOR OF CODE SHARING THAT TAKE THE PANEL ALONG WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES WAS THAT AT THAT CAN ASSIST CONSISTENT PARTNER IN THERE AND THE THERE. YOU KNOW THE READY THIS THIS PLAN ISN'T JUST SO SET ON OURSELVES BUT TO BE A ROAD MAP FOR YEARS TO COME AND YOU KNOW WE CAN'T DO IT ALL OVER NIGHT EVEN IF WE WANTED TO WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO DO IT SO IF WE GIVE US A- SUITCASE OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO DO. EMPLOYMENT THE PLANNERS. WORKFORCE ISSUES AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND FACILITIES AND LINKING THE PIECES AND SO YOU KNOW LIKE. THIS OLD YOU KNOW EAST ONE LITTLE BY THE TIME RIGHT AND SO I THINK THAT THAT IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF IT BUT- I DO WANT TO TAKE HIS DIG DOWN IN THAT IS OVERWHELMING EVERYTHING THAT WE PUT FORWARD BUT THERE ARE SOME SPECIFICS OF TODAY'S HEARING IS FOCUSED ON. INTERVENTION SERVICES WITH CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS AND ALLOW THAT STARTS WITH PROPER SCREENINGS YOU CAN KNOWN WHAT TO DO AND LESS YOU HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND SO I KNOW THERE ARE FEW PROPOSALS I WORK IN A ONE THIS YEAR BUT IN THE REPORT YOU TALK ABOUT MAYBE YOU CAN THIS WOULD BE A HIGHLIGHT TO US TODAY IS THAT THERE ARE RESOURCES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE HAVE THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT ALWAYS DRAWING DOWN AS MUCH AS WE COULD. TO DO THAT WORK AT THE AT AT AT THE AT THE BEGINNING WAS WONDERING IF YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT NANCY AND WHAT OPPORTUNITIES WE MAY HAVE IN CALIFORNIA FTA TO LEVERAGE OUR STATE MONEY TO BRING DOWN MORE RESOURCES FOR THE WORK WE'RE TRYING TO DO. I'M. I THINK THAT WE HAVE IN IF YOU LOOK. IN DEATH AS THE HAND OUT THE FOUR PAGE HANDOUT. WE TALK ABOUT WE HAVE SEVEN FINANCING RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MAKE AND FROM PAGE EIGHTY TO NINETY IF YOU'RE THE WHOLE REPORTED IT'S ON PAGE FOUR. OF THE HAND OUT AND SO I THINK THAT WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW ALL OF THOSE RESOURCES ARE YOU USE IT IT WAS KIND OF IT WAS REALLY. I THINK I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT IT TOOK FOUR MONTHS TO CHANGE THAT. PRIVATE INSURANCE CODE ON THE MEDIC HOW. KIND OF APPLICATION SO I MEAN THE FIRST THING WE CAN DO IS JUST MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S VERY GOOD TRAINING WHEN PEOPLE ARE DOING CERTAIN ADDITIONAL. WORK AND THAT WE AREN'T YOU KNOW LOSING SIX MONTHS OF ELIGIBILITY FOR A CHILD AND INTEGRATION OF SERVICES BUT WE ASK THAT. THAT THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR AND THE S. P. I. AND WE SAID DECEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN BUT THAT. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S STILL RITUALISTIC. TO LOOK AT ALL OF THE FEDERAL OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING MEDI CAL WITH THE REALLY DEEP LOOK AT CURRENT PRACTICES WHAT SOME OTHER STATES ARE DOING. SO THAT WE CAN DRIVE DOWN ALL OF THE ALL OF THE MONEY THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO DRIVE DOWN WITH MEDI CAL. AND EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES FOR. THE EARLY AND PERIODIC SCREENING DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT WHICH FUNDS PERIODICSCREENINGS AND IDENTIFIED NEEDED TREATMENT. REALLY SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK AT RIGHT AWAY AND IF WE INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES TO REALLY. DEVELOP BEST PRACTICE AND COUNTY LEVEL SOLUTIONS AND WORK IS GETTING YOU'LL HEAR FROM FIRST FIVE AND SOME OF THE OTHER CHILD SERVING AGENCIES. TO ADOPT ALL OF THE BEST PRACTICES OF THE WE GET EVERY SINGLE. DOLLAR THAT WE CAN AS WELL AS LOOKING AT. AT MENTAL HEALTH PLANS IN THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES SO. WHILE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MEETING ALL OF THE FEDERAL EARLY START AND- THE I. D. A PART C. EARLY INTERVENTION GUIDELINES BUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THAT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ARE TAKING EVERY POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION I THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE. SOME DEEP LOOKING AT WHAT SOME OF THE OTHER AT THE RECOMMENDATIONS AS THEY ARE RIGHT NOW AND A NEW LOOK TO DO THAT. MATHIS AB ONE MORE THING PLEASE OF. PROVIDERS IF A CHILD COMES TO OF IF A PARENT COMES AS IN THEIR CHILD HAS SPECIAL NEEDS OR DISABILITIES. WE CANNOT TURN THAT FAMILY AWAY. SO WE HAVE TO HONOR THE LANTERN MINUTE. AND EVEN IF WE'RE NOT TRAINED OR EQUIPPED WE STILL HAVE TO OPEN UP OUR FACILITIES SO THAT. YEAH THE TRAINING FEES. IS VERY CRUCIAL AND ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT PROVIDERS HAVE MUCH MORE ACCESS TO THE ENHANCED RATES THAT THEY NEED RIGHT SO THERE'S IT'S WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A WHOLE LARGER RATE REFORMS TO REALLY MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW. VERY FEW OF THE PROVIDED IT IS VERY KIND OF LIKE DIFFICULT PROCESS FOR PROVIDERS TO OBTAIN ENHANCE RATES. ALL RIGHT WELL WITH THAT I KNOW OUR- RUNNING SHORT ON TIME SO LET ME. THINK THIS FAT THANK YOU FOR. YOUR TESTIMONY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU OBVIOUSLY WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES ARE SPENDING LEGISLATION BUT ALSO BUDGET ASKS IN THE FUTURE SO THANK YOU LET'S GO TO MOVE TO OUR THIRD PANEL LOCAL PURCHASER EARLY INTERVENTION RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT. WE HAVE MARKET GRANT GOLD POLICY DIRECTOR FOR FIRST FIVE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIAN FRANCESE AN INFILL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THIS MORNING. AND LISTENING TO ALL THE TESTIMONY BEFORE BUT EVERYONE'S THINK EVERY PANELS REFERRING TO THE NEXT PANEL. WHICH I THINK BODES WELL FOR INTEGRATION AND BREAKING DOWN SILOS WORKING TOGETHER AT A COMMON SOLUTION SO PLEASE BEGIN WITH TESTIMONY ABSOLUTELY HAPPY TO JUMP INTO THEIR AND BUILT ON THE THEMES OF BREAKING DOWN SILOS AND HELPING CREATE MORE FAMILY CENTRIC SYSTEMS OF CARE. MY NAME IS MARGARET GOULD I IN THE POLICY DIRECTOR OF THE FIRST FIVE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA VERY PROUD TO HEAR WITH OUR COLLEAGUE FRANCESE AND FROM THE INFANT DEVELOPMENT CENTER TO REALLY TALK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND.% AND TO START SHARING SOME PROMISING PRACTICES AND THEN TO HAVE AN INITIAL CONVERSATION AROUND SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SOME. BEFORE JUMPING IN JUST ONE RIGHT A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT ABOUT FIRST FIVE. IT WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT A CHILDREN'S TO FIVE FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS NOW SINCE OUR INCEPTION. AND WE KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT. POSSIBLE WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION INTERVENTION SYSTEM HOLISTICALLY. WE DO BELIEVE THAT NO ONE PERSON IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A CHILD'S HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT AND IN FACT WE ALL PLAY A KEY ROLE AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE HEARD CONSTANTLY FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT PANELS AND JUST LOOKING AT ALL THE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF HOW WE- HOW WE ALL ARE. INTRICATELY INVOLVED WITH IN A CHILD'S HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT. SO PARENTS NEED TO BE ABLE TO ASK THE QUESTIONS THAT THEY- ABOUT THEIR CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND ASK FOR HELP WHEN THAT IS NEEDED. CHILD CARE PROVIDERS NEED TO KNOW THE EARLY SIGNS OF DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS AND NOT TO WAIT TO INTERVENE WHEN NECESSARY. AND EVERY PEDIATRICIAN SHOULD NOTICE GREEN KIDS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF LAYS AS WELL IN THEIR ENTIRETY. ALL OF THIS IS REALLY BAD AND WHAT IS HOLISTICALLY BECOME THE SYSTEM OF CARE THAT IS A NO WRONG DOOR SYSTEM THAT WE LIKE TO CALL OUR HELP ME GROW SYSTEM AND WE DO CALL THE SYSTEM IN ON A PROGRAM BECAUSE IT IS MULTI FACETED. WITHIN ITS NATURE HELP ME GROW AS A NATIONAL MODEL ABOUT HALF OF THE STATES IN THE US DO CONSIDER THEMSELVES HELP ME GROW AFFILIATES AT FIRST FIVE COUNTY COMMISSIONS HAVE BEEN WORKING ALONGSIDE OUR CRITICAL PARTNERS ACROSS ALL THOSE FIELDS AGAIN IN ORDER TO BUILD OUT THESE HELP ME GROW SYSTEMS OF CARE WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS ON A COUNTY BY COUNTY BASIS FOR ABOUT THE LAST NINE YEARS FIRST ORIGINATING. AT FIRST FIVE ORANGE COUNTY. AT THE SERVICE LEVEL HELP ME GROW AS A CENTRALIZED ACCESS POINT THAT ESSENTIALLY WORKS LIKE A TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER IT HELPS ENSURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW WHERE TO GO WITHIN THE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO HELP BETTER CONNECT. THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT FAMILIES ULTIMATELY DO RECEIVE SERVICES. HOWEVER IT UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE TO HELP ME GROW AS MUCH MORE IS IT IS HELP BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF THE ACTUAL SYSTEM. SO I KNOW THAT WE KEEP BRINGING UP MORE LINE WHICH IS A WONDERFUL PROGRAM. MORE LINE IS IN PART FUNDED BY FIRST FIVE SACRAMENTO THIS IS A HELP ME GROW PART OF THE SYSTEM OF CARE IT'S UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF HELP ME GROW. IT'S ACTUALLY HOW WE WERE FORTUNATELY CONNECTED TO LIVE TO SEE IT TODAY IN ORDER TO COME UP AND HELP SHARE HER STORY. SO IT'S UNDERNEATH THAT GUY'S OF HELP ME GROW SACRAMENTO AND WORKING WITH A STRIVE IN ROLLA EXACTLY EXACTLY. BUT IT IS ALL WORKING IN UNISON IN UNISON. SO ON THE GROUND LEVEL WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE VISITS IT IS THIS LARGE COMPLICATED SYSTEM IT'S I WANTED TO GIVE A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF WHAT IT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE FOR INDIVIDUALS AND PROVIDERS. SO FOR A PARENT THE MOTHER OF A TWO YEAR OLD WHO'S CONCERNED ABOUT THAT OUR SON IS NOT SPEAKING. SHE WOULD CALL A HELP ME GROW CENTRALIZED ACCESS POINT OR GET IN TOUCH WITH THEM AND HELP ME GROW CARE COORDINATOR WOULD HELP WALK THROUGH THE MOTHER THROUGH A DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING QUESTIONNAIRE. OFTEN IN HER OWN NATIVE LANGUAGE IN ORDER TO ASSESS YOUR CHILD'S DEVELOPMENT. FROM THERE SHE WOULD CONFIRM AT THE SIGHT OF HER. IN THIS CASE SCENARIO SIGN IT WOULD SCORE OF A CONCERN AND WOULD HELP NAVIGATE THAT FAMILY TO THE APPROPRIATE ACCESS TO SERVICES WILL PROBABLY ALSO RECOMMENDING DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES THAT THEY COULD BE DOING AT HOME TO IMPROVE A CHILD'S DEVELOPMENT. THAT HELP ME GROW CARE COORDINATOR WITH AND FOLLOW UP WITH THE- OTHER ONE WEEK AFTER THEY FIRST INITIALLY TOUCH BASE TO MAKE SURE OF WHERE THEY IT IS THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE IN THE SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVEN'T FALLEN THROUGH THE CRACKS AT THAT POINT IN TIME. FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHO ARE CRITICAL TO THE SYSTEM OF CARE. WE HAVE ALSO WE HAVE. OFTEN HEARD FOR YEARS THAT PEDIATRICIANS WILL NOT SCREW THEIR RELUCTANCE TO SCREEN WITHOUT HAVING PROPER INTERVENTIONS IN PLACE. HELP ME GROW HELPS FILL THIS ROLE BY ENSURING THAT THERE ARE PROPER LINKAGES THAT ARE THERE. SO TESTIMONIALS FROM SO MANY OF THE PEDIATRICIANS AND CLINICS THAT WE WORK WITH. THEY SURE THAT THEY ARE MORE THEY'RE MORE. ACCEPTING OF DOING FULL DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS KNOWING THAT THEY CAN HAND OFF THIS. THIS FAMILY TO HELP ME GROW IN ORDER TO HELP REFER THEM TO SYSTEMS OF CARE. BUT IN ADDITION TO JUST THE NAVIGATION HELP ME GROW AS HELPING CLINICS. AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. AROUND BEST PRACTICES AROUND USING THE FULL TOOL ITSELF. I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT IS THE ONLY MEMBER MCCARTY'S BILL AB ONE ZERO ZERO FOUR AND IS HUGE CHAMPIONSHIP OF THAT EFFORT. AGAIN MAKING SURE THAT THE FULL DEVELOPMENT OF SCREENING TOOLS USED IN ITS ENTIRETY AND THAT WE'RE COLLECTING THE NECESSARY DATA ON THE BACK AND TO ENSURE THAT THIS HAPPENED THAT THIS IS. ONLY HAPPENING AS RECOMMENDED. OF A FEW OTHER COMMISSIONS OR EVEN LICENSING THAT ALL MY NEEDS DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING TOOLS THEMSELVES TO HELP INSURE THAT THESE. TO REMOVE THAT BARRIER TO MAKE SURE THE DEVELOPMENT OF TOOLS ARE. OUR ACCESSIBLE TO THE TO THE PROFESSIONALS THAT DO IN FACT NEED THEM. FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND THAT CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO DO THE PROPER SCREENINGS AND REFER TO THE INTERVENTION. IF THEY HAVE A GREAT BUT IF THEY HAVE A VERY ACCESSIBLE PLACE TO REFER TO HELP ME GROW CAN AGAIN SERVE THAT FUNCTION. IN ADDITION FIRST FIVE ALONG WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER PARTNERS ARE PROVIDING THIS TRAINING IS ON HOW EXACTLY TO. LEARN THE SCIENCE ACT EARLY. AND ALSO TO PROVIDE ON THE TRAINING OF HOW TO HELP THOSE DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS WITH FAMILIES THAT WE DID HEAR ABOUT CONTINUALLY FROM OUR PARENT TESTIMONIES. SO CURRENTLY THERE ARE TWENTY SIX FIRST FIVE COMMISSIONS WERE EXPANDING IN LAUNCHING IN THE EARLY AYE IDENTIFICATION INTERVENTION SYSTEMS ALONG THESE LINES OF HELP ME GROW. WE ARE WORKING ALONGSIDE CRITICAL PARTNERS SUCH AS REGIONAL CENTERS MANAGED CARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. WARM LINE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CBO IS WHO WERE ALSO ALL PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE WITHIN THIS. ONE TELL ME GROW IS FULLY LUNCHEON IMPLEMENTED WITHIN THESE COUNTIES HELP ME GROW WILL BE AVAILABLE 285% OF ALL CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA. BUT I WILL EMPHASIZE BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FROM A COUNTY BY COUNTY BASIS IT REALLY IS EVERY SO COUNTIES AT A DIFFERENT POINT IN TERMS OF ITS IMPORTATION AND HOW FAR WHY THIS HAS BEEN SPREAD. I DID WANT TO SHARE A RECENT REPORT BECAUSE WE DID JUST RECENTLY RECEIVED DATA FROM ALAMEDA COUNTIES HELP ME GROW WHICH IS VERY. KIND OF FURTHER ALONG IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION STAGES AND TO SHARE A COUPLE KEY POINTS THAT CAME UP FROM THEIR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN DATA. ONE THING THAT THEY FOUND IS THAT THERE CALL VOLUME HAS INCREASED 7100% SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN AS MORE AND MORE FAMILIES DO KNOW ABOUT THE HELP ME GROW NAVIGATION SERVICES THEMSELVES. SO RIGHT NOW AS OF LAST YEAR THEY RECEIVED. JUST OVER TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED CALLS. THESE ARE PRIMARILY FAMILIES OF COLOR MINORITY CHILDREN WHO ARE SEEKING SERVICES AND THOSE WHO WE REALLY WANT TO HAVE ACCESS TO SERVICES WITH AN EARLY INTERVENTION SYSTEMS. LAST YEAR AGAIN HELP ME GROW SERVED FAMILIES SERVICE FAMILIES IN THIRTY EIGHT DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SO THERE'S A LOT OF CAPACITY IN WHICH WE CAN ACTUALLY GET WITH CONNECTING FAMILIES TO APPROPRIATE CARE TIM. I'M ALMOST FAMILIES WERE CALLING REGARDING DEVELOPMENTAL QUESTIONS HELP ME GROW IS HELPING ADDRESS A NUMBER OF NEEDS THAT THEY MIGHT BE EXPERIENCING WITHIN THE HOME. ABOUT 13% OF THE REFERRALS THAT CAME FROM HELP ME GROW ALSO RECEIVED A HOME VISIT THAT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS. SO HELPING FAMILIES WITH THE PARENT EDUCATION. AND A NUMBER OF ON THE REFERRAL SERVICES AS WELL. AND OTHER COMMON REFERRALS ALSO INCLUDED CHILD CARE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. BASIC SUPPORTS AND BASIC NEEDS ANOTHER PARENT SUPPORTS SO IN THIS SENSE HELP ME GROW IS REALLY HELPING CONNECT FAMILIES TO WHAT THEY NEED WELL IT MIGHT START AS DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING IN IT IS A MUCH BROADER SYSTEM. ALL IN ALL HELP ME GROW IS SIMPLE FIND THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION INTERVENTION FIELD. AND IS HELPING FILL CRITICAL GAPS THAT WE JUST SEE YOU ALL TOO OFTEN ACROSS THE ACROSS THE SPECTRUM. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE SOME IS PROMISING PRACTICES HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU ALL MIGHT HAVE NOW THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT MOVES. DECISIONAL TESTIMONY PLEASE GOOD MORNING I'M FRENCH ACE AND I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF REPRESENTING THE PROVIDERS WHO ARE SUPPORTING THE PROXIMALLY FORTY THREE THOUSAND. CHILDREN ZERO TO THREE AND THEIR FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE EARLY START PROGRAM. THE HAND OUT THAT WAS DISTRIBUTED EXPLAINS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PART SEE EARLY START SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA AND IT IS DIVERSE IT IS COMPLEX. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR FOCUSING ON THIS UNIQUE AND BENEFICIAL SYSTEM. JOINTLY OPERATED IN CALIFORNIA BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. IT'S NOT A PERFECT SYSTEM BUT HAS MULTIPLE BENEFITS FOR OUR STATE COMMUNITIES AND CITIZENS. AND I'VE ALSO PREPARED A FACT SHEET THAT INDICATES THE RESEARCH ECONOMIC AN INDIVIDUAL BENEFITS THAT WILL EXPLAIN SOME OF MARGE IN MORE DETAIL OF THE IMPORTANCE OF EARLY START. YOU ASKED US TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES AND CONCERNS AND I'M NOT ALONE IN BRINGING UP THE LACK OF FUNDING. IT'S A MAJOR CONCERN IN FOCUS FOR THOSE BUSINESSES PROVIDING EARLY START SERVICES AND THESE ARE BUSINESSES. A RECENT TEMPORARY ADJUSTMENT OF A POINT 2% FOR VENTURE PROGRAMS IN THE TRAILER BILL EIGHTY ONE LEFT OUT THE INFANT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM COATS AND THERAPY CODES. EIGHT OF EIGHT OH FIVE SAID ONE SIXTEENS AND INCLUSION OF THESE CLOTHES CODES IN A TRAILER BILL CLEANUP LANGUAGE WOULD BE A PLACE TO START IN ADDRESSING THIS PIECE. YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE GREAT RECESSION BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT DID YOU KNOW THAT EARLY START AN INFANT DEVELOPMENT TOOK ON MOST OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS. FAMILY FOR THE HOLIDAY SCHEDULE USE A PRIVATE INSURANCE ELIMINATION OF HIGH RISK FROM ELIGIBILITY DEFINITION. THERE'S ALSO BEEN OTHER FACTORS THAT IMPACT THIS ECONOMIC NEED. 8% CONSUMER PRICE INDEX GROWTH A 12% IN CALIFORNIA'S WAGE INDEX. ARE THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION. RECOMMENDS INVESTING IN SUPPORTING RESOURCES FOR EARLY START. THAT IS CRITICAL THERE ALSO WAS DEVELOPMENT OPERATE MODEL FOR ADJUSTMENT FOR BOTH FOR PAYMENT OF SERVICES THIS IS GOING TO TAKE A WHILE ESPECIALLY SINCE THE CURRENT STUDY ADMITS TO BEING FLAWED AND IN PERFECT THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TASK FORCE IS GETTING UNDER WAY TO ADDRESS THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE HOWEVER IN THE MEANTIME FAMILIES NEED TO HAVE PROGRAMS AND PROVIDERS FOR ACCESS TO REALLY START SERVICES. AND SUPPORTING PROGRAMS TO ENHANCE OUT REACH FOR DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING WILL NOT SHOW A POSITIVE RESULT IF THERE ARE NOT SERVICE PROGRAMS FOR REFERRALS. ANOTHER SPECIFIC HAS TO DO WITH THE FAMILY PARTICIPATION FEE. SHARE CHIANG FAMILIES FOR SERVICES FOR THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN IS WRONG TO LACE NEEDED SERVICES AND LEADS TO WORST DEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOMES I THINK THERE'S LEGISLATION ON THAT YES SENATOR STERN IS PUTTING FORTH THE BILL SB FOUR ONE TWO. THERE ARE EFFORTS CURRENTLY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE SITUATIONS SUCH AS THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSIONS THE BILL. ONE OF THE USE OF PRIVATE INSURANCE FOR FAMILY SAYS CREATED A BARRIER WITH THE REQUIREMENT OF COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES IF A SERVICE BEGINS IT MIGHT TAKE ON A START AND STOP PATTERN WITH FREQUENTLY CHANGING STAFF. FAMILIES HAVE TO ADJUST TO DIFFERENT STAFF WHO HAVE NO TIME TO COLLABORATE PLAN INDIVIDUAL SERVICE PLANS TOGETHER. IT IS ALSO CREATED A NEW LEARNING CURVE FOR IN FROM PROGRAMS TO A FAT TO EDUCATE THEMSELVES ON A VARIETY OF INSURANCE OPTIONS COLLECTIONS OF FEES CODES. MEDICAL REPORT WRITING. AND SERVICE GUIDELINES. THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN THOSE THEY ARE REQUIRED TO DO FOR ALL START. DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE CHILD FIND COMPONENT OF EARLY START ONCE A SCREENING IDENTIFIES THE DEVELOPMENTAL CONCERNED THE FAMILY. CAN CAN SEEK AN ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION TO DEVELOP A DETERMINE A REFERRAL APPROPRIATE REFERRAL. THE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO MEET ITS REQUIREMENTS AND BE SUCCESSFUL NEEDS WELL TRAINED WORK FORCE. AS INDICATED IN THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION REPORT ONE OF THE STRENGTHS OF IN FROM PROGRAMS AS A WELL TRAINED TEAM OF DISCIPLINES CHILD DEVELOPMENT SPECIAL EDUCATOR OCCUPATIONAL PHYSICAL AND SPEECH THERAPISTS SOCIAL WORKER NURSE PHYSICIAN PSYCHOLOGIST ETCETERA. AND THERE ARE MANY RESEARCH BASED PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES AND PERSONAL COMPANIES COMPETENCIES AVAILABLE INCLUDING THE ICC EARLY START PERSONAL MANUAL FOR ONE. A WELL TRAINED WORKFORCE ALSO NEEDS TO INCLUDE THE SERVICE COORDINATORS WITHIN THE REGIONAL CENTERS SYSTEM. THEY NEED TO BE AWARE OF WHAT IS A QUALITY SERVICE HOW TO SUPPORT A FAMILY THROUGH ITS ENTRY IN TRANSITION FROM EARLY START. THANK YOU FOR BEGINNING A CONVERSATION ON HOW THIS SYSTEM CAN BE IMPROVED ALL SYSTEMS CAN BE IMPROVED. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR CONSUMERS. HOWEVER I CAN TELL YOU FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT EARLY START DOES WORK I KNOW THIS FROM FEEDBACK I GET FROM PARENTS AND THEIR CHILDREN THAT I'VE WORKED WITH OVER THE YEARS. THE PARENTS WHO MET IN IN IN FROM PROGRAM WHO STILL CONNECT WHENEVER A TRANSITION OCCURS. IN THERE NOW ADULT CHILDREN'S LIVES NEW PROGRAM A WEDDING DEATH. THEY CONTINUE TO SHARE THE KNOWLEDGE FROM THEIR INTERACTIONS IN IN IN FROM PROGRAM SETTING WHERE THEY LEARN TO SUPPORT ADVOCATE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. AS SHOWN BY THE PARENTS SHARING OF INFORMATION TODAY. THAT IS THAT IS A REALLY INCREDIBLE POINT TO REMEMBER. LIKE THE WARM LINE. SHARES AS A FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER AS ONE OF THE MAINSTAY OF EARLY START SERVICES. THEY ARE SUPPORTING PARENTS THROUGH CRITICAL TIME SO THEY CAN EFFECTIVELY TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I. BELIEVE PARENTS WANT TO HELP EACH OTHER AND ONCE THEY LEARN HOW TO HELP EACH OTHER THAN THEY HELP EACH OTHER. RIGHT BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THE PAIN AND THE STRUGGLES OF TRYING TO HELP YOUR CHILD AND I THINK THAT WAS RELEVANT TODAY IN ITS ROLE THAN AND I THINK EVERYONE'S TESTIMONY IS KIND OF REITERATED THAT POINT AS WELL. LET ME JUST ASK A GENERAL QUESTION BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE THESE PROGRAMS IN EARLIER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SILOS AND BREAKING DOWN SILOS AND INTEGRATING. HOW DOES EARLY START WORK WITH HELP ME GROW DO THEY OVERLAP DO YOU INTEGRATE HOW TO HOW TO TURN UNDERSTAND LIKE WHAT FIRST FIVE IS DOING WITH THE COUNTY IS DOING. WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE DOING AND HOW THAT ALL INTEGRATES WITH EACH OTHER TO TRY TO FIGURE THAT OUT FOR A PARENTS ARE. ABSOLUTELY PLEASE NOW IN AND IDEALLY YEAH SO HAPPY TO EXPLAIN THIS AND IDEALLY. YOU KNOW WERE BROUGH HOPEFULLY WE'RE BUILDING A SYSTEM THAT IS GOING TO BE A NO WRONG DOOR SOLUTION FOR FAMILIES SO THAT THEY DON'T KNOW KIND OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF WHAT THE- OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING BEHIND THE SCENES IN TERMS OF MONEY TRANSFERS AND AMMO USE THAT ARE IN PLACE. BUT IDEALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING AND AGAIN HELP ME GROW IS DIFFERENT IMPORTATION STAGES DEPENDING ON WHICH COUNTY IT'S AN- BUT WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEN BUT THE COUNTIES THAT. ARE FURTHER ALONG IN IMPLEMENTATION. AT ITS BEST HELP ME GROW IS HELPING AND WORKING VERY MUCH IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS THEMSELVES. BECAUSE WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO DO IS TO HELP IDENTIFY THE FAMILIES THAT ARE MOST AT RISK. THAT WOULD NEED TO GO THAN RECEIVE SERVICES FROM THE REGIONAL AS THE PRE SCREEN AND A LOT OF WAYS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE FAMILIES AND THEN CONNECTED TO SERVICES THAT THEY CAN ALTERNATE RECEIVE. AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE KIND OF FINAL TO THE RIGHT APPROPRIATE SPOT. MA'AM OKAY AND SO RIGHT NOW HELP ME GROW IS AND HOW MANY COUNTIES TWENTY SIX. TWENTY SIX COUNTIES AND WHAT ALL AT DIFFERENT STAGES BUT. SO HOW DO WE GET IT STATEWIDE IS IT JUST A MATTER RESOURCES SEVENTY MATTER RESOURCES AND IT'S A MATTER OF BUILDING OUT THE NECESSARY COUNTY INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE I THINK WAS ALSO CRITICAL TO THIS IS. THERE ARE A EXISTING ASSETS THAT ARE GOING TO VERY COUNTY TO COUNTY SO SOME OF THOSE PARTNERSHIPS DO LOOK SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY. BUT ENSURING THAT THIS IS A EVEN GETTING THOSE CONVERSATIONS TOGETHER LOCALLY TO START SAYING CAN WE SET UP A HELP ME GROW WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE LOCALLY. AND ALL EVEN HIGHLIGHT FIRST FIVE KERN WHO'S HERE TODAY THERE ARE MOST RECENT COUNTY THAT'LL BE STARTING TO HELP ME GROW SYSTEM. EVEN STARTING TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS LOCALLY ABOUT WHO NEEDS TO BE AT THE TABLE TO START SAYING WE'RE ALL GONNA WE WILL ALL COLLECTIVELY OWN A PIECE OF THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION INTERVENTION SYSTEM. IS CRITICAL TO BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS IN THE STARTING THOSE FOR STOPS. AND SEVEN FOR EARLY START WE KNOW. YOU KNOW IDENTIFYING PEOPLE EARLIER HOW ARE WE- PUSHING TOWARDS THE TESTING THAT WAS IS A THREE MONTHS NINE MONTHS TWELVE MONTHS TWO YEARS OLD HOW'S THAT HAPPENING WITH THESE PROGRAMS THERE'S JUST GUIDING THE PARENTS TO SAY HEY TALK TO YOUR HEALTH PLANS YOUR INSURANCE OR MEDICARE AL. AND TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT OF. HI HOW DO WE GET TO THAT POINT. IN TERMS OF THE PARENT EDUCATION THE OTHER PARENT EDUCATION ARE JUST IS THAT HAPPENING YEARS IS JUST SOMETHING THAT. HERE IN THIS PROGRAM AND NOW I NEED YOU TO GO DO X. Y. AND Z. AND THAT INCLUDES A SCREENING TESTS YEAH I CAN SPEAK AS A AS A NEW PARENT. I HAVE I HAVE AN EIGHT MONTH OLD. THE KIND OF IN THE THICK OF IT. AND I KNOW ALL TO QUICKLY SHARED AS AS WELL THIS ISN'T TANYA AND ACTUALLY KIND OF AND- I HAD. AND INSPIRED ME TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF MY STORY TO MY AND MY DAUGHTER WAS BORN VERY PREMATURE ANSWER SHE'S HIGH RISK FOR DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS SAID THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I TALK ABOUT. ALL THE TIME WITH AND WORK BUT I THINK ABOUT ALL THE TIME BUT THEN MY HOME TO. AND IN TERMS OF THE- THE DEVELOPMENT THAT WERE THAT WE ARE TRACKING ON A VERY REGULAR BASIS. SHE IS DOING GREAT AND SHE'S ON TRACK BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT THAT IT IS MORE PIECE MAILED AND YOU DO RECEIVE DIFFERENT FROM A FROM DIFFERENT PLACES. BUT WHAT THEY DO YOU RECOMMEND FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS IS THAT YOUR CHILD WILL GET SCREENED AT NINE MONTHS EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND THEN EITHER TWENTY FOUR THIRTY SIX MILE THIRTY MONTHS. SO YOU ARE LOOKING AT THIS IT IS STANDARDIZED AND THAT IS PART OF THE EMPHASIS OF THE BILL AB ONE ZERO ZERO FOUR IS THAT A HELP STANDARDIZE THIS AS WELL. ABOUT THAT PERIODICITY OF WHEN YOU ACTUALLY DO GO THROUGH SCREENS. BUT I THINK WHAT WE HEARD FROM SO MANY OF THE PARENTS THAT IS SO CRITICAL. IS THAT. WE KNOW THAT IT'S NOT JUST GOING TO BE THESE WELL CHILD VISITS OF WHEN YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY FIRST IDENTIFIED DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS. IT IS GOING TO BE ALL OF THOSE THAT ARE HAVING ACCESS REGULARLY WITH YOUNG CHILDREN. THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE PART OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE TO HELP BUILD OUT THAT HOLISTIC SYSTEM OF CARE. AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK OF VALUE OF A HELP ME GROW SYSTEM IS BECAUSE IT IS TRYING TO. WORK IN CONJUNCTION AND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ONE ANOTHER. GOT IT I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING FROM EVERYONE IS LIKE HOW DO WE GET TO THIS HOLISTIC. STANDARD OF CARE. BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE THE SAME OUTCOME FOR THE CHILD. AND MINE SO. OKAY WELL THANK YOU. WE ASK. ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY IF NOT THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO I JUST WANT TO AT LEAST COMMENT WITH. HOW WE ARE WE'RE LOOKING AT DOING WHETHER WE CALL IT TRYING TO FIND WHETHER WE CALL IT. DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING. THE NOTION IS TO BE ABLE TO OFFER FOR ALL CHILDREN. THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE ACCESS. TO ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT PIECES. ALL CHILDREN ARE NOT GOING TO NEED. DEVELOPMENTAL FOLLOW UP. BUT PERRANCE. IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ADDITIONAL EDUCATION AND SUPPORT TO FAMILIES SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE EMOTIONAL TURMOIL OF WORRYING WHAT THEY'RE SEEING IS WHAT. AND IT AND BY OFFERING IT WITH EQUAL ACCESS. WOULD I THINK BE VERY BENEFICIAL THAT I THINK THAT'S WHY THE ADVOCATES OR THE- LINES. ARE SO IMPORTANT SO INTEGRAL SO APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. WHAT'S GOOD AND MOVED OUT TO PUBLIC COMMENT WE HAVE ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS. PLEASE APPROACH IF YOU COULD STATE YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION OR WITH OR YOU'RE NOT WITH AN ORGANIZATION WHICH COUNTY OR FROM. I HAVE A LIMIT TO LESS THAN TWO MINUTES PLEASE THANKS CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CINDY JACKSON SENIOR PROGRAM ANALYST OF THE RECEIPT ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES PARKER. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT IS PRESENT OUR TESTIMONY TODAY AND FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUBMIT WRITTEN TESTIMONY IN WHICH WE HAVE. AKA AGREES WITH MANY ASPECTS OF THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION FINAL REPORT. AND SUPPORTS THE IMPROVEMENT OF EFFICIENCY AND OVERALL OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN RECEIVING EARLY START SERVICES. HOWEVER IT'S BEEN A LACK OF FUNDING THAT IS POLLS SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IN REACHING CHILD OUTCOMES FOR EXAMPLE. INADEQUATE FUNDING LEVELS FOR SERVICE PROVIDER REGIONAL CENTERS FOR YEARS AND IN SOME CASES DECADES HAVE LEFT THE PROGRAM STRETCHED TO THE LIMIT. FAMILIES HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY EXPECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COST OF CERTAIN EARLY START SERVICES SOME OUT OPT OUT OF SERVICES DUE TO THIS FEE. REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE BEEN UNDERFUNDED FOR DECADES RESULTING IN A SHORTFALL OF SERVICE COORDINATORS SIX HUNDRED X. SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE SERVICE COORDINATORS NEEDED STATEWIDE. IN A TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH MANDATES. ANY PROPOSAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF INFANTS AND TODDLERS WITHOUT NECESSARY FUNDING WILL FURTHER EXACERBATE THE EXISTING CHALLENGES IN PROVIDING TIMELY SERVICES. WALKER SUPPORTS THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION REPORT THAT PERTAIN TO ADDITIONAL NEEDED INVESTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE EARLY START SERVICES SYSTEM TO IMPROVE SERVICE DELIVERY MEETING THE NEEDS OF YOUNG CHILDREN REQUIRE ADVOCATE ADEQUATE FUNDING. FOR EXISTING SERVICE PROVIDERS RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT. AT AND REGIONAL CENTER OPERATIONS FOR CRITICAL FUNCTIONS RELATED TO SERVICE COORDINATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU AND BELIEVE ALL THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE OR FIGHTING FOR. THOSE BUDGET. THIS BUDGET ASKS ISRAELIS. ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY. GOOD MORNING I'M DONNA SNARE INJURE I'M WITH THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER WORLD NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHO PROVIDES ALL ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF SERVICES. FROM HEAD START AND CHILD CARE PROGRAMS THROUGH HOME VISITING AND A VARIETY OF OTHER MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS IN TRAINING FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. I A WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY TONYA MCMILLAN ABOUT THE CRITICAL ROLE THE CHILD CARE PROVIDERS CAN PLAY. REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING AND SUPPORT SYSTEM CHILDREN ARE GOING TO CHILD CARE EVERY DAY. AND THE PROVIDERS ARE NOT SUPPORTED IN THAT WORK BUT THEY ARE THERE AND THEY ARE READY AND WILLING TO BE A PART OF THAT A SUPPORT SYSTEM AND I THINK THAT IT'S A READY MADE EXAMPLE OF. HOW WE CAN BETTER INTEGRATE OUR PROGRAMS THE OTHER THING IS I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ECHO SUPPORT FOR THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION I THINK A LOT OF GOOD WORK WAS DONE AND NOW IT'S OUR JOB TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. THANKS SO MUCH THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY PLEASE MY NAME IS JACKIE CLARK AND I JUST RETIRED FROM AN INTERN PROGRAM THAT WAS BOTH FUNDED BY THE STATE PART OF EDUCATION FOR UP TO FUNDED CAPACITY WHICH IS PRIMARILY A DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING CHILDREN VISION IMPAIRED SOLELY LOW INCIDENCE CHILDREN AND THEN WE'VE ALSO BEEN A REGIONAL CENTER VENDOR AND I THINK IT'S A WONDERFUL TIME TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF EARLY INTERVENTION I KNOW IDA PART SEE. AND ON SPECIFICALLY EARLY START HAS THAT IN THEIR STATUTES AND REGULATIONS THAT EARLY START SHOULD BE A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH OF MULTIPLE AGENCIES BECAUSE FISCALLY AND IN COMMUNITIES CHILDREN ARE INVOLVED WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND I THINK SPEAKING TOWARDS THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF TAKING CARE OF CHILDREN GOES A LONG WAY FROM ACROSS ALL AGENCIES I KNOW IN OUR PROGRAM. WE PULL TOGETHER ALL OF OUR ON COUNTY SERVICE AGENCIES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WHEN THEY HAVE THE- FEDERAL INCENTIVE FUNDS FOR THE LAKERS LOCAL INTERAGENCY COORDINATING AREAS. AND SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING AS NO. THE SINGLE DOOR OF ENTRY EVERYONE ACROSS REFERS TO EACH OTHER AND EVEN IN TRANSITION WE HAVE OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS MEETING WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER SERVICE COORDINATORS AND- THE EVER PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR MONTHLY TO HELP TRANSITION CHILDREN. WE START THAT PROCESS SIX MONTHS AHEAD OF TIME AND THEN AT AGE THREE THE TRANSITION. BUT THE BIGGEST BARRIER THAT WE HAVE BEEN FACING IS FUNDING WE HAVE NOT HAD FUNDING INCREASES SINCE THE MID SEVENTIES ON A REGIONAL CENTER SIDE WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD DECREASES. IN ON OUR CD HE SIGHED WE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF FUNDING INCREASE BY GOVERNOR DEUKMEJIAN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BUT NOTHING ELSE WE RECENTLY ELIMINATED FIVE POINT FIVE POSITIONS ARE NURSING. IF A FAMILY MENTAL HEALTH SO. THE FUNDING IN DOES HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ESPCIALLY SINCE THE RESEARCH BASE TO GO OUT TO THE FAMILIES AND PROVIDE A COACHING MODEL WITH THE FAMILIES ON EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES OF. WHAT DO THEY DO DURING THE DAY WATER THEIR ROUTINES WHAT IS A LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING OF CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND INTERVENTION ACTIVITIES THAT'LL HELP PARTICIPATION IN THE FAMILY AND THEN THOSE. DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES WILL GO OUT AND TEACH THE FAMILY INTERVENTION STRATEGIES AND THEN ALL THE DIFFERENT DIVERSE DISCIPLINES WORK TOGETHER SO TRAVELING OUT TO THE HOMES WAS NOT EVER ON THE COST OF THAT WAS NEVER MITIGATED WHEN. AND THE EARLY START WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE SO THE FUNDING STATE FLAT BUT OUR COST INCREASE. TO TRAVEL OUT TO THE HOMES AND THEN INSTEAD OF SEEING SIX TO EIGHT FAMILIES A DAY WE CAN ONLY SEE TWO TO THREE SO YOU HAVE TO HIRE MORE STAFF TO SEE THE SAME AMOUNT OF FAMILIES WHICH WAS YOUR COMMITMENT. AND I KNOW FOR OUR REGIONAL CENTER VENDORS STATION WE DROP FROM FOREHAND FOUR HUNDRED FAMILIES DOWN TO NINETY FAMILIES BECAUSE THE RATES ARE PAYING US WE CAN'T SUSTAIN OUR OUR STAFF. YEAH THOSE WERE ALL DISCUSSIONS. WE HAD IN OUR BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES AS WELL GREAT THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY. HI SHARI MARTIN WITH FIRST FIVE LA FOR SEVERAL A HAS MADE EARLY IDENTIFICATION INTERVENTION OUR TOP PRIORITY AND IMPROVING HEALTH RELATED SYSTEMS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND US ALONG WITH CHILDREN NOW IN FOR SIDE ASSOCIATION ARE CO SPONSORING AB WINTERS ARE FOR MCCARTY SMELL ON DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING TO CLARIFY THE CURRENT. PARTNER WITH THE SYSTEM MORE AND INVEST IN A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY IN OUR HELP ME GROW LA INVESTMENTS HAVE IDENTIFIED LOCAL ISSUES WHICH WERE ALL ACT AGO TODAY ON LINKAGES TO SERVICES AND SCREENING PRACTICES BUT I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT SO FOR SCREENING PROVIDERS HAVE A VARYING DEGREE OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT DEVELOPMENT ON BEHAVIORAL DELAYS AND SCREENINGS PROVIDERS HAVE VARYING DEGREES OF COMFORT HAVING THE CONVERSATION ABOUT DELAYS WITH FAMILIES. THERE'S INFRASTRUCTURE LIMITATIONS AND WORK FLOW DYNAMICS THAT MAKE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF SCREENING DIFFICULT TO PRACTICE A LACK OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVES AND OVERSIGHT FOR PROVIDERS AND HEALTH PLANS AFFECTS THE PRACTICE OF SURVEILLANCE AND SCREENING IN THE QUALITY OF DATA THAT'S AND RETRIEVED AND A LACK OF CONSISTENCY ENERGIZED GREEN DATA COLLECTED ACROSS EARLY DEDICATION AYE INTERVENTION SYSTEMS EXISTS WELL AND THEN FOR THE LINKAGES TO SERVICES WE HAVE A REALLY FRAGMENTED SERVICE SYSTEM IN COMPLEX ELIGIBILITY AND REFERRAL PROCESSES. THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO MATCH IDENTIFIED NEEDS WITH APPROPRIATE REFERRALS AND THEN THE REFERRALS AND LINKAGES TO EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES ARE OFTEN UNSUCCESSFUL BECAUSE OF LIMITED SERVICES IN ANY GIVEN COMMUNITY TO ADDRESS THE CHILD IN FAMILIES UNIQUE NEEDS SO NETWORK ADEQUACY IS ANOTHER CONCERN. GOT IT THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY. GOOD MORNING OUTS TO CAPRI ON BEHALF OF FOR SIDE CALIFORNIA. AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR EARLY START SERVICES IS TOO HIGH IN CALIFORNIA AND FAR ABOVE THAT OF MOST OTHER STATES. THIS HAS MAJOR CONSEQUENCES FOR FAMILIES PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH CHILDREN WHO HAVE MILD TO MODERATE DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS. SO FOR CHILDREN WITH MILD TO MODERATE DELAYS EVEN LIGHT TOUCH APPROACHES CAN HELP RETURN THEM TO AN OPTICAL PATH FOR DEVELOPMENT AND THE PROCESS OF WAITING THE NEED FOR MORE COSTLY INTERVENTIONS INTERVENTIONS LATER IN LIFE. IMPORTANTLY EARLY INTERVENTION IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN A WAIT AND SEE APPROACH PRECISELY BECAUSE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR DECREASED SAYS THAT THE CHILD GROWS OLDER AND BRAIN DEVELOPMENT SLOWS. ADDITIONALLY AND MORE BROADLY CALIFORNIA'S EARLY IDENTIFICATION INTERVENTION SYSTEM IS FRAGMENTED UNDER RESOURCE AND LACKING THE CAPACITY NECESSARY TO ADEQUATELY SERVE CHILDREN. PARENTS HAVE DIFFICULTY NAVIGATING WHERE WHAT CARE THEIR CHILD IS OR IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY AND THAT'S DIFFICULT IT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO A FEW DIFFERENT THINGS. ONE THE GEOGRAPHICALLY BASED STRUCTURE OF THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM EMILY TO PARENTAL CONFUSION RESULT IN CERTAIN SERVICES NOT BEING AVAILABLE LOCALLY. ON THE PROVIDER SIDE PEDIATRIC PEDIATRICIANS MAY LACK KNOWLEDGE ABOUT AVAILABLE RESOURCES AND US BEING ABLE TO PROMPTLY ARE FOR FAMILIES TO SERVICES. AND THREE THE STATE'S EARLY INTERVENTION SYSTEM ITSELF AS COMPLEX AND STRUGGLES TO ENGAGE WITH FAMILIES. PARENTS OFTEN HAVE DIFFICULTY NAVIGATING ON THEIR OWN SO THE STATE MUST BETTER ENSURE THAT FOR CHILDREN WHO MEET ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS PARENTS KNOW THAT FREE REGIONAL CENTER CARE IS AVAILABLE. AND WHAT SPECIFIC SERVICES ARE ACCESSIBLE LOCALLY AND BE ASSURED THAT HIGH QUALITY EARLY INTERVENTIONS ARE AVAILABLE WHEN THEY NEED THEM. AND FOR CHILDREN WHO DO NOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS THE STATE SHOULD NOTIFY FAMILIES ABOUT SERVICES AND RESOURCES EXIST OUTSIDE THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM. AND WHAT SURVEILLANCE IS AVAILABLE TO MONITOR ELIGIBILITY IN THE FUTURESO POLICIES THAT IMPROVE COORDINATION WITH AN E. A. I. SYSTEM AND AN INCREASE THE FAMILY'S ABILITY TO SECURE SERVICES FOR THEIR CHILDREN ARE VITAL. AND SHOULD BE ADOPTED IN SUPPORT OF. A CALIFORNIA THANK YOU THANK YOU ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY. MR TERRITORIES ANDERSON WITH THE ARK IN UNITED CEREBRAL PALSY CALIFORNIA COOPERATION. FURTHER ONE OF THANK YOU AND THE OTHER MEMBERS THAT WERE HERE FOR HOLDING THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. SECOND THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ALL THE WORK THEY DID IT. HUGE THANKS TO THEM FOR THAT. WE YOU WE'VE HEARD A LOT TODAY AND IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'D LIKE TO SO SEAT MY COMMENTS WITH THOSE THAT WERE MADE BY. MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE FRANCE A SOME FROM IDA WE REALLY REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT HOW WE FUND THE SYSTEM. AND UNDERSTAND THAT THESE THERE'S A MODEL IN PLACE WE HAVE WE KNOW WHAT THE MODEL IS AND WE KNOW WHAT HOW. SUCCESSFUL IS. WE NEED TO FIND IT SO WE CAN HAVE THE PROVIDERS THEIR FOR THE MILE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY PLACE. HELLO MY NAME IS ERIC HARRIS I AM WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AND I ALSO THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS A VERY SPECIAL HEARING TODAY AND I OF A LINE A LOT OF MY COMMENTS WITH THE PREVIOUS COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE BUDGET IN THE FINANCE FOR THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE I WANNA DRESS A CERTAIN QUESTION THAT YOU HAVE THAT YOU ASKED EARLIER ABOUT YES WHAT SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE BASICALLY PRIORITIZE WHEN IT COMES TO YOUNG PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS AND YOUNG PEOPLE DISABILITIES. AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THE DANCES THAT WERE GIVEN WERE VERY VERY STRONG IN TERMS OF THE AREAS THAT SHOULD BE PRIORITIZE BUT I WOULD SAY IN ADDITION TO THAT THAT I HOPE OF THAT YOU IN ANY OTHER LEGISLATORS IN THIS BUILDING DO NOT HESITATE OF BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO BE EITHER PERFECT OR TRYING TO PRIORITIZE THE EXACT THING THAT YOU THINK OF PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS YOUNG PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS PARENTS AND FAMILIES. OF YOUNG PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS NEED BECAUSE IT'S ALL IMPORTANT SO EVERY ANGLE THAT YOU CAN ADDRESS THESE ISSUES REALLY REALLY CRUCIAL I KNOW ONE OF THE ONE OF THE REASONS WHY MOST PROUD TO BE AT THE ARE SEEING ONE OF THE ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE DRC REALLY PRIDE OURSELVES THAT WE ADDRESS ISSUES FROM A WIDE ARRAY OF ANGLES SO WE WILL ADVOCATE FOR PEOPLE WE WILL ADVOCATE FOR PEOPLE IN THIS BUILDING WE WILL LITIGATE ISSUES WE WILL ADDRESS INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND WE- OF AND WE REALLY JUST TRIED TO ADDRESS. ALL ISSUES WITH DISABILITIES IN AS MANY ANGLES AS WE CAN SO I HOPE THAT MOVING FORWARD NOT JUST I KNOW THAT THIS COMMITTEES. A GREAT ONE FOR THIS ISSUE BUT EVERYBODY IN THIS BUILD. NG I HOPE OF WILL ADDRESS. ISSUES RELATING TO DISABILITY AND AS MANY AREAS AS THEY CAN ESPECIALLY GETTING INFORMATION TO PARENTS GETTING INFORMATION TO FAMILIES ESPECIALLY FAMILIES WHO ARE LOW INCOME ESPECIALLY FAMILIES OF COLOR FAMILIES WHO. DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE ACCESS TO. THE SAME INFORMATION THAT OTHER FAMILIES MIGHT SO I HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO DO THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING WE WILL DO ALL WE CAN. AS AN ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION AT YEAR SEE OF TO BE IN THIS BUILDING AND REPRESENT AS MANY OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AS WE CAN. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY PLEASE. MORNING MORNING MORNING IN THE MORNING BUT A ROLE IN MY ARM EXACTLY DIRECTOR FIRST FIVE KERN AS YOU KNOW I APPLAUD THAT UNIT COMMITTEE ARE LOOKING AT EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND PREVENTION WE ARE FAILING TOO MANY KIDS AND FAMILIES AND BOTH IDENTIFYING DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS AND A PER AND ACCEPTING APPROPRIATE SERVICES. SEEING TOO MANY FAMILY FAILED TO THE CRACKS IN KERN COUNTY. AND HEARING ABOUT THE BEST PRACTICE SO SHOULD WOULD HELP ME GROW WE MAKE MADE THAT MOVING KERN COUNTY OUT WITH A WITH A LOT OF OUR PART AND WE COULDN'T DO IT WITHOUT THE MHSAA DOLLARS FOR P. E. I. THAT THAT ARE. KERN RAVER HELP RECOVERY SERVICES JUST GAVE US SOME FUNDING FOR THAT WE WORKED WITH TWO ONE ONE FOR PROBABLY A COUPLE YEARS NOW YOU KNOW IT'S A FIRST FIVE FUNDED PROGRAM. LOOKING AT SERVICES AND REFERRALS. WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TRY TO MAKE IT PERFECT OR OR MAKE EVERYTHING IN PLACE IN STE AND WE'VE WAITED TOO LONG WE ACTUALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON BOARD BUT- WE ARE VERY ACTIVE NOW FIRST FIVE. WITH THE TWO ONE ONE AND HELP ME GROW MODEL SO I THINK THAT'S AN EXCELLENT STARTING KERN COUNTY. STATE LEVEL LEADERSHIP AND GUIDANCE FRAWLEY BOTH FOR OUR LOCAL SYSTEM BUILDING EFFORTS. WE HOPE THIS COMMITTEE CAN STUDY HOW TO FURTHER EXPAND CALL DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS. AND IMPROVE LINKAGES TO SERVICES AND EXPAND ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE IN AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND IT FOR FIVE KERN AND ALL THE FIRST FIVE THAT ARE HERE IN THE ASSOCIATION. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE THERE WITH YOU ALL THE WAY LONG AND PLEASE THINK OF US AS AN ADVOCATE AND AN A SERVICE THAT WE CAN HELP YOU. AND I'M ALSO GOING TO BE WILLING TO HELP YOU AND WHEN WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION IN KERN COUNTY. THANK YOU ARE ONLY BE ON THE FRONT RIGHT FOR FIVE ROAD FOR THAT ALL RIGHT ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU WE SHOULD YOU BEING HERE THANK YOU. DIGITAL TESTIMONY PLEASE. HI GOOD MORNING I'M ERIN MARI WITH FIRST I SACRAMENTO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS COMMITTEE TOGETHER. AND IT IS GREAT TO BE PART OF A NETWORK THAT IT ALREADY IS IN PLACE FIRST FIVE IN EVERY COUNTY. AND IS MARGO SAID NOW TWENTY FIVE HELP ME GROWS. WHICH ARE MAINLY FUNDED BY FIRST I SACRAMENTO AND AS YOU KNOW AS A DECLINING FUNDING SOURCE. THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO PICK UP ALL THOSE PIECES AND CONTINUE THE SERVICES. THAT'S WHY WE ARE LUCKY TO HAVE YOU. MAKING THOSE POLICY CHANGES AND THEN ALSO FINDING WAYS TO LEVERAGE SOME OF THE DOLLARS THAT. ROLAND SAID. HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY I'VE HAD THE ABSOLUTE HONOR AND PRIVILEGE TO LAUNCH HELP ME GROW HERE IN SACRAMENTO. WE ARE THE CSUS SOLE FUNDER IT IS HOUSE OUT OF THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. AND WARM LINE IS OUR- CALL CENTER. AND JUST HEARING ALL THE TESTIMONY I JUST HAVE TO SAY THE BEST NEW WORDS I HAVE FOR HELP ME GROW. AS WHAT MARGOT SAID IS A TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTER. AND THAT IS WHAT IT IS IT IS SEAMLESS. PARENTS DON'T NEED TO KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO. IT JUST HAPPENED. AND WHAT'S NICE IS THAT THIS PROGRAM. FOLLOWS UP THIRTY SIXTY DAYS TO MAKE SURE THOSE PARENTS ARE GETTING WHAT THEY NEED. SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU AND FIRST FIVE IS THAT YOUR PARTNER MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS THANK YOU. WE SHOULD THAT. DIGITAL TESTIMONY PLEASE. THANK YOU MY NAME IS STEPHANIE GOMEZ I'M A LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER I WORK WITH SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND HELPING TO ROLLOUT THIS HELP ME GROW SACRAMENTO I DID NOT HAVE PREPARED THOUGHTS SO WHAT I WANTED TO SAY A VERY VERY VERY BRIEFLY WAS A FEW CONCRETE EXAMPLES AND OF RECOMMENDATIONS RELATING TO YOUR QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAD SPECIFICALLY I'M SO OF. OF COURSE WE TALKED ABOUT FUNDING RIGHT FOR EARLY INTERVENTION I DON'T HAVE TO SAY THAT AGAIN BECAUSE MY PARTNER FROM PLASTER COUNTY SPOKE VERY ELOQUENTLY TO THAT. WE'D THIS IS VERY OVERWHELMING AND IF WE THINK ABOUT JUST STARTING FROM THE BOTTOM UP. IT'S NEVER GOING TO GET DONE SO I THINK LEVERAGING THE STRENGTHS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT. SO HELP ME GROW THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA TO MAKE SURE IT'S IN EVERY COUNTY THAT REALLY IS GOING TO BE THE ONE STOP SHOP WHERE. LOCAL PROVIDERS EARLY CHILDHOOD PROFESSIONALS EVERYBODY IN THE COUNTY WHO LAYS EYES ON A CHILD WILL KNOW THAT IF THEY HAVE CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS THEY JUST CALL HELP ME GROW IN THEIR COUNTY. AND SO IT'S GOING TO BE THAT EASY ACCESS BUT AGAIN WE'RE GONNA NEED FUNDING FOR THAT. ON THE SECOND THING I WANTED TO ADDRESS. SO WE'RE DOING THE WERE DOING THE SCREENING AND WE'RE DOING THE CONNECTING TO RESOURCES BUT WE'RE ALSO FINDING. THAT THERE'S A LACK OF RESOURCES RIGHT SO WE HAVE TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY IN THE LONG RUN. WE ARE FINDING BECAUSE I WORK IN OUR EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAM. THAT SOME OF OUR CHILDREN WE HAVE CONCERNS FOR THERE'S A ONE TO TWO YEAR WAIT LIST FOR FURTHER ASSESSMENT. THEY ARE TOLD THEY WILL NOT EVEN. THEY THEY'RE BEING TOLD THAT THEY MIGHT NOT EVEN GET TO SEE A NEUROLOGIST UNTIL THE CHILD IS THREE BUT THERE'S CONCERNS EIGHTEEN MONTHS. WE NEED MORE PROFESSIONALS IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE TRAINED AND ARE REIMBURSED AND WILL GO INTO THIS FIELD SO WE CAN SPEED THAT PROCESS UP. THEN THERE'S A PROCESS SOME OF THEM ARE ON A WAIT LIST FOR YEAR TWO IN ORDER TO GET ABA IN THE FIRST. PLACE WE NEED INCENTIVES I THINK AND TRAINING PROGRAMS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE MAYBE WE TUITION REIMBURSEMENT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IN ORDER TO GET MORE PEOPLE IN THE FIELD BECAUSE WE CAN SCREEN THEM.

I'M HERE TODAY AS A PARENT I HAVE A DAUGHTER WHOSE NOW TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OLD. THIS A PICTURE OF HER WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER. SORRY WRONG PICTURE. LOOK AT THAT ONE LATER ANYWAY I'M HERE BASICALLY BECAUSE I AFTER MY DAUGHTER WAS BORN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY BACK IN THE EARLY NINETIES MY FAMILY WAS LITERALLY SAVED BY THE EARLY START PROGRAM PILOT THE CALIFORNIA I HAD A TOTALLY DIFFERENT LIFE THAN THE THINGS I LIKE TO POINT TO AS A BENEFIT OF THE EARLY START PROGRAM TODAY TWENTY SOMETHING YEARS LATER NUMBER ONE MY FAMILY IS TOGETHER MY WIFE AND I. ARE. WE'RE ACTUALLY CARING FOR MY DAUGHTER BECAUSE AS AN ADULT SHE NEEDS TO LIVE IN A SAFE PLACE SO WE'RE WILLING TO DO THAT. NOW WHERE DID WE- BEGIN TO LEARN ABOUT THAT IN THE EARLY START PROGRAM. WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS BORN MY WIFE WAS DEVASTATED I WHICH SHOCKED. BUT I DID WHAT MOST MEN DID I TRIED TO CARRY ON THE PAST I COULDN'T KEEP HOPE. FORTUNATELY WE WERE REFERRED TO AN EARLY START PROGRAM. THERE REALLY SAVED OUR LIVES SAVE MY DAUGHTER'S LIFE IN MANY INSTANCES. JUMP FORWARD SEVERAL YEARS I BEGAN WORKING AS A PARENT AND AS A FATHER'S ADVOCATE AND I BECAME. A FAMILY SUPPORT SPECIALIST WITH THE AN EARLY START CAMERA RESOURCE CENTER RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND EVENTUALLY I BECAME THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE WARM LINE TEN RESOURCE CENTER. I'M HERE TO SAY THAT IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THAT HAVE BEEN LOTS OF CHANGES. TO THE EARLY START PROGRAM ESPECIALLY SINCE TWENTY OH NINE ONE THING I WOULD POINT TO THAT I THINK IS VERY DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING FOR FAMILIES. IS HAVING TO FIND. ACT INSURANCE ACCESS FOR NEEDED THERAPEUTIC SERVICES THAT CAME IN IN TWENTY TEN AND I WOULD STAY STRONG AND I THINK THAT HINDERS. FAMILIES IT KEEPS THEM. IT TAKES TOO MUCH ENERGY ON WARRIOR AWAY FROM THE IMPORTANT THINGS THAT THEY HAVE TO DO. I WILL BE BACK TO TESTIFY AGAIN AND TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE HEARINGS. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR WHAT I HAVE TO SAY EMPLOYEES INVEST MORE IN EARLY START SO THAT FAMILIES WILL BE TOGETHER JUST LIKE MINE IS TODAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANKS. FOR SHARING YOUR PERSONAL STORIES WELL. THIS ALL TESTIMONY. I THINK I GET TO BE THE FIRST TO SAY GOOD AFTERNOON TECHNICALLY. MY NAME IS JENNIFER TAKE CARD SOME WITH THE WEST AND CENTER FOR PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION. AND I THINK A LOT OF THE TESTIMONY OF HER TODAY HAS BEEN FROM A FEW DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES THE PARENT PERSPECTIVE SUPER IMPORTANT MOST IMPORTANT. AND ALSO HEARING FROM THE PROVIDERS AND PROGRAMS I'M COMING FROM A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE WE ARE CONTRACTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA TO CARRY OUT THE COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM A PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT. EVERY STATE HAS TO HAVE ONE ACCORDING TO IDC A PART SEAT LAW. AND SO IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS DONE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES WHO AT HAS A CONTRACT WITH US TO CARRY THAT OUT WE ALSO PARTNER CLOSELY WITH CD BECAUSE OF THIS SORT OF. TWO PART SYSTEM AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE YOU AWARE OF THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED UNDER THIS CONTRACT WITH DDS. SUCH AS WE HAVE IT A FREE ONLINE COURSE SYSTEM THAT IS ALL ABOUT THE BASICS OF EARLY START SO I WOULD HIGHLY ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO LOOK INTO THIS AS A AS A POTENTIAL RESOURCE BECAUSE- THIS SYSTEM IS COMPLICATED THERE'S A LOT GOING ON THERE I'VE HEARD. BITS AND PIECES OF IT AND I THINK THAT THE SOLUTION TO ALL THESE PROBLEMS IS GOING TO BE. NOT ONLY YOU HAVE TO START WITH THE AWARENESS OF WHAT IS PART OF THE SYSTEM WE ACTUALLY HAVE ONLINE COURSES I CAN HELP SORT OF. OUT OF WHAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON THERE THE FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER HOW DID THEY PLAY A PART IN THE EARLY START SYSTEM. AND I'M JUST A VARIETY OF RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE I THINK WILL REALLY HELP JUST FORM THE BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS EARLY START AND WHAT DO WE HAVE TO WORK WITH. BUT THEN ALSO YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THAT SYSTEM A PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT AS PART OF THE SOLUTION HERE. WE DO HAVE TRAININGS FOR PROVIDERS AND WE DO HAVE TRAININGS AND ON FAMILY ENGAGEMENT AND BEST PRACTICES. SO HOW CAN THAT PLAY A PART IN THE SOLUTIONS TO COME. THANK YOU THANK YOU ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY. HELLO I'M TERRACE SIZE MORE HESTER AND I'M AN ASSISTANT DIRECTOR AT VALLEY MOUNT REGIONAL CENTER OVERSEE EARLY START SERVICES I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF ISSUES ONE AS OUR CASELOAD RATIOS ACROSS THE STATE ARE NOT GOOD AND IN A IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SERVICES I AM TWO CHILDREN AN EARLY START WHICH I THINK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT REGIONAL CENTERS DO AT THE SECOND ISSUE THAT WE HAVE IN OUR AREA AND I THINK IT'S ACROSS THE STATE ALSO IS. PROVIDER RATES WERE LOSING PROVIDERS BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T HAD INCREASES AND SEVEN YEARS SEVEN AND A COUPLE OF DECADES SO THOSE ARE THE TWO HOT TOPICS THAT I THINK THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS ENTIRE. ISSUE THANK YOU THANK YOU. HEARING AND SEEING A MORE PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS. LET ME JUST SAY I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR BEING HERE TODAY IS A VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION IT'S ONE OF. MANY DISCUSSIONS WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY OF BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS AND SILOS. I THINK IT'S ONLY THROUGH AN INTEGRATED APPROACH THAT WERE REALLY GOING TO HOLISTICALLY HELP FAMILIES IN THESE CHILDREN. WE GET WEIRD. FROM THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AS WELL SOME OF THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE ON THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION AND SOME OF THE FINDINGS THERE. I THINK FROM EACH EVEN ALL THE PUBLIC COMMENT IS THE NEED FOR RESOURCES THEY NEED TO TACKLE THIS. I THERE IS PROBABLY NO PERFECT WAY TO TACKLE IT SO I GET THE PRIORITIES BUT- MAYBE. DIFFERENT POTS OF MONEY BECOME AVAILABLE AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND MAYBE THAT'S HOW WE JUST START TACKLING IT FROM EVERY ANGLE THAT WE CAN. BUT IT TRYING TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE PARENTS THAT ARE DEALING WITH THIS AND THE STUDENTS. AS I CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND I KNOW THAT SOMETHING THAT. ME AND MY TEAM IN THIS COMMITTEE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT I KNOW THERE'S AT LEAST THREE. BILLS THAT ARE PENDING. BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE HELPING ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION AND SOME OF THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED HERE TODAY. THOSE ARE PROBABLY PIECES OF LEGISLATION AND I WILL BE LOOKING AT AS WELL. THE D. DISCUSSIONS ON THE- MONEY ALLOCATION FOR DDS SERVICES IN GENERAL I KNOW WAS A BIG. POINT OF DISCUSSION DURING THE MAY REVISE THAN ALTERNATELY RIGHT BEFORE THE BUDGET WAS SIDE BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I KNOW A LOT OF MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW IN OUR CAUCUS AS WELL OR DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS IS SOMETHING THAT WE BROUGHT UP AS A PRIORITY. CONTINUING TO MOVE FORWARD WILL CONTINUE ON THOSE FIGHTS AND CONTINUE TO PUSH AT THE GOVERNOR AND LEADERSHIP AND EVERYONE IN BOTH HOUSES. TO MOVE US TO A PLACE WHERE WE'RE STARTING TO ADD. ADD MORE SERVICES SOMETHING WE'RE WE'RE STILL TRYING TO RECOVER OF WE SOME PEOPLE YESTERDAY WERE CALLING IT THE GREAT RECESSION. DURING THE EIGHT OH NINE TEN YEARS. SEVEN EIGHT NINE YEARS.

WITH THE LEGISLATIO AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD IDAHO I THANK MY STAFFER ERRAND. OF LEAD TO UPSET UP TODAY'S THING AND HE'LL BE FOLLOWING UP ON A NUMBER OF MAYBE SOME LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE HELP.
