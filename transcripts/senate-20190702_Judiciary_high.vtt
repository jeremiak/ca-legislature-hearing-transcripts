SUPREMACY CLAUSE THE WHAT WE

MIGHT EXPECT A CHALLENGE ON THE

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:31.911
BASIS OF PRE EMPTION AND THE

00:08:31.978 --> 00:08:33.579
BASES OF THE INNER GOVERNMENTAL

00:08:33.646 --> 00:08:35.281
IMMUNITIES CLAUSE.

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:37.617
IN MY OPINION A. B. THIRTY TWO

PREEMPTION.

00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:45.725
WOULD NOT HOLD BECAUSE THIS IS

00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:46.292
NOT AN ATTEMPT TO REGULATE

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:48.694
IMMIGRANTS WHO CAN BE DEPORTED

00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:49.896
WHO WHO CAN BE ADMITTED.

00:08:49.962 --> 00:08:51.898
SO IT'S NOT A FEEL PREVENTION

00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:53.833
PROBLEM THERE'S NO CONFLICT IT

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.769

00:08:56.836 --> 00:08:59.839
OWN FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA.

00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:01.007
AND ALSO THERE'S NOT BEEN AN

00:09:01.073 --> 00:09:04.076
EXPRESSION BY CONGRESS IN THE

00:09:04.143 --> 00:09:05.578

00:09:13.686 --> 00:09:15.721
SO THERE'S NOT AN EXPRESSION

00:09:15.788 --> 00:09:16.255
THAT WOULD YOU WOULD BE A

00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:17.023
PROBLEM.

00:09:17.089 --> 00:09:18.457
INTER GOVERNMENTAL IMMUNITIES

00:09:18.524 --> 00:09:21.160
DOCTRINE IS ABOUT DISCRIMINATION

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:23.562
DOES THIS DISCRIMINATE AGAINST

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:25.464
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE

00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:27.033
SHORT ANSWER IS CLEARLY NO IT

00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:29.135
THIS IS ABOUT REGULATING PRIVATE

BY TAKING A TOOL BOX OR TAKING

00:20:08.173 --> 00:20:09.174
TWO OUT OF THE TOOL BOX.

00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:09.808
THE PRISON SYSTEM WILL BE LEFT

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:11.476
WITH FEW OPTIONS WHEN IT COMES

00:20:11.543 --> 00:20:13.278
TO CROWDING.

00:20:13.345 --> 00:20:14.479
THE STATISTICS WE'VE HEARD THE

00:20:14.546 --> 00:20:16.848
THE BUFFER AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS

00:20:16.915 --> 00:20:17.783
ABOUT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED INMATES

00:20:17.849 --> 00:20:18.550
MEANING.

00:20:18.617 --> 00:20:20.552
THAT IF THE POPULATION OF THE

00:20:20.619 --> 00:20:23.355
PRISON SYSTEM INCREASES BY ABOUT.

00:20:23.422 --> 00:20:24.990
ONE TO ONE POINT 2% WE WILL BE

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:28.026
AT THE FEDERALLY MANDATED CAP.

00:20:28.093 --> 00:20:29.161
WHICH MEANS INMATES GET RELEASED

00:20:29.227 --> 00:20:30.362
SHARES HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT

00:20:30.429 --> 00:20:31.997
INMATES GETTING RELEASED AND NOT

00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:34.099
HAVING THAT TOOL TO HELP MANAGE

00:20:34.166 --> 00:20:35.400
POPULATION AT THE STATE PRISON

00:20:35.467 --> 00:20:36.368
SYSTEM.

00:20:36.435 --> 00:20:39.004
OUR SECONDARY AND OTHER CONCERN

00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:41.173
IS THAT -- WE HAVE SEEN THE

00:20:41.239 --> 00:20:42.808
IMPACTS OF REALIGNMENT ON COUNTY

00:20:42.874 --> 00:20:45.344
JAILS -- AND THIS IS NOT A

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:46.078
COMPLAIN ABOUT REALIGNMENT

00:20:46.144 --> 00:20:47.980
CERTAINLY A BUT UNDERSTANDING

00:20:48.046 --> 00:20:50.182
THAT -- THE AUTHOR AND

00:20:50.248 --> 00:20:51.850
PROPONENTS HAVE HAVE ALLUDED TO

00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:53.919
THE FACT THAT THERE MAY BE -- ON

00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:55.554
USE JAIL BEDS CURRENTLY AROUND

00:20:55.621 --> 00:20:57.189
THE STATE AND THAT THAT --

00:20:57.255 --> 00:20:59.524
SHOULD BE USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE

00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:01.393
TO HOUSING FOLKS WHO WOULD MIGHT

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.061
OTHERWISE BE HOUSED IN A PRIVATE

00:21:03.128 --> 00:21:03.595
PRISON.

00:21:03.662 --> 00:21:04.997
INSURES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:21:05.063 --> 00:21:06.732
FACT THAT IF THAT BECOMES A

00:21:06.798 --> 00:21:08.433
REALITY THAT -- THAT WILL

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.402
INCREASE PRESSURE ON THE COUNTY

00:21:10.469 --> 00:21:12.738
JAIL SYSTEM -- WITHOUT RESOURCES

00:21:12.804 --> 00:21:14.673
LIKELY -- AND WILL EXACERBATE

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:15.507
THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE ALREADY

00:21:15.574 --> 00:21:16.808
FACE IN COUNTY JAILS WHO ARE

00:21:16.875 --> 00:21:19.177
HOUSING OFFENDERS -- WHO USED TO

00:21:19.244 --> 00:21:21.279
SERVE SIXTY OR -- NINETY HUNDRED

00:21:21.346 --> 00:21:22.114
EIGHTY DAYS SURF HEY HOUSING

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.149
THEM FOR THREE FIVE TEN YEARS AT

00:21:24.216 --> 00:21:25.884
A TIME BECAUSEOF REALIGNMENT

00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:27.519
AND SO AGAIN BECAUSE OF THOSE

00:21:27.586 --> 00:21:28.754
CONCERNS NOT A STORY ABOUT

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.255
PRIVATE PRISONS GOOD PRIVATE

00:21:30.322 --> 00:21:31.390
PRISONS BAD.

00:21:31.456 --> 00:21:32.557
BY TAKING A TWO OUT OF THE TOOL

00:21:32.624 --> 00:21:34.226
BOX AND INCREASING PRESSURE ON

00:21:34.292 --> 00:21:36.261
COUNTY -- RESOURCES THAT'S THE

00:21:36.328 --> 00:21:37.929
BASIS OF OUR OPPOSITION

00:21:37.996 --> 00:21:38.697

OPPOSED TO THE NOTION OF A

00:21:52.911 --> 00:21:53.979
PRIVATE PRISON.

00:21:54.046 --> 00:21:56.481
PRISONS HAVE TO BE TRANSPARENT

00:21:56.548 --> 00:21:58.250
THERE HOUSING PEOPLE.

00:21:58.316 --> 00:21:59.685
FOR OFTENTIMES SERIOUS CRIMES

00:21:59.751 --> 00:22:01.019
THESE ARE NOT NECESSARILY

00:22:01.086 --> 00:22:02.688
WONDERFUL FOLKS BUT THEY ARE

00:22:02.754 --> 00:22:03.755
HUMAN BEINGS AND THEY'RE

00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:07.192
ENTITLED TO AND WE THE PUBLIC

00:22:07.259 --> 00:22:09.061

00:22:09.127 --> 00:22:09.661
TRANSPARENCY.

00:22:09.728 --> 00:22:10.829
IN THE PRISON SYSTEM AND TO MAKE

00:22:10.896 --> 00:22:13.398
SURE THAT PRISONERS ARE.

00:22:13.465 --> 00:22:15.067
BEING CARED FOR APPROPRIATELY

00:22:15.133 --> 00:22:16.568
WITH BASIC LEVELS OF HUMAN

00:22:16.635 --> 00:22:19.771
DIGNITY AND AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER

BONTA YOU POINTED OUT THAT --

00:22:21.506 --> 00:22:23.175
THERE THERE ISN'T THAT KIND OF

00:22:23.241 --> 00:22:24.576
SUNSHINE.

00:22:24.643 --> 00:22:26.311
IN OUR PRIVATE PRISONS AND THE

00:22:26.378 --> 00:22:27.913
MOTIVATION FOR THEM IS VERY

00:22:27.979 --> 00:22:29.381
DIFFERENT BECAUSE AS PRIVATE

00:22:29.448 --> 00:22:31.183
ENTERPRISES THEIR GOAL IS TO

00:22:31.249 --> 00:22:32.551
MAXIMIZE PROFIT.

00:22:32.617 --> 00:22:35.153
OF NOT NECESSARILY TO MAXIMIZE

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.322
REHABILITATION WHICH IS ACTUALLY

00:22:37.389 --> 00:22:38.857
ALSO BEEN A PROBLEM IN OUR

00:22:38.924 --> 00:22:40.358
PUBLIC PRISONS BUT SOMETHING

00:22:40.425 --> 00:22:42.427

CIVIL INCARCERATION IN OUR STATE.

00:23:05.317 --> 00:23:07.652
I THINK -- THERE IT MAY VERY

00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:09.921
WELL BE A A CHALLENGE BY THIS

00:23:09.988 --> 00:23:11.523
CURRENT ADMINISTRATION ON A ONE

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:12.691

CALIFORNIA THEY HAVEN'T

00:23:13.859 --> 00:23:16.695
CHALLENGED BUT I THINK THAT.

00:23:16.762 --> 00:23:18.530

IT IF -- IF THEY CHOOSE TO SUE

00:23:31.476 --> 00:23:33.411
THE STATE I THINK THIS BILL IS

00:23:33.478 --> 00:23:35.647
ADDRESSING ALL PRIVATE PRISONS.

00:23:35.714 --> 00:23:38.250

00:35:01.199 --> 00:35:02.366
PEOPLE.

00:35:02.433 --> 00:35:03.668
WHO SERVE THIS COUNTRY IN THE

00:35:03.734 --> 00:35:04.902
ARMED FORCES?

00:35:04.969 --> 00:35:06.771
I REMEMBER BACK AT THE END OF

00:35:06.838 --> 00:35:08.906
THE VIETNAM WAR WHERE WE DID

00:35:08.973 --> 00:35:10.408
GIVE PREFERENCE POINTS I WAS

00:35:10.475 --> 00:35:12.009
LIVING IN LOS ANGELES AT THE

00:35:12.076 --> 00:35:13.911
TIME AND WHAT WE DISCOVERED WITH

00:35:13.978 --> 00:35:16.147
THOSE PREFERENCE POINTS.

00:35:16.214 --> 00:35:17.949
IS THAT IT.

00:35:18.015 --> 00:35:19.884
RATED AN IMPOSSIBLE OBSTACLE FOR

00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:22.220
WOMEN AT THAT TIME IN PARTICULAR

00:35:22.286 --> 00:35:24.722
WHO WERE A AND UNDERSERVED ARE

00:35:24.789 --> 00:35:26.891
UNDER REPRESENTED I SHOULD SAY A

00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:28.526
GROUP WHEN IT CAME TO GOVERNMENT

00:35:28.593 --> 00:35:30.328
SERVICE -- THIS OF COURSE

00:35:30.394 --> 00:35:33.064
APPLIES TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR AS

00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:34.065
WELL.

00:35:34.131 --> 00:35:35.399
AND I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER

00:35:35.466 --> 00:35:38.002
REALLY CAUGHT UP IN SO -- I

00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:39.437
CAN'T SUPPORT BILLS THAT

00:35:39.504 --> 00:35:41.806
AUTHORIZED GIVING A PREFERENCE

00:35:41.873 --> 00:35:43.407
TO A POPULATION THAT IS.

00:35:43.474 --> 00:35:46.077
APPROXIMATELY 90% MALE.

00:35:46.143 --> 00:35:47.678
AND A POPULATION THAT HAS

00:35:47.745 --> 00:35:50.615
HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED THE LGBTQ

00:35:50.681 --> 00:35:51.883
COMMUNITY.

00:35:51.949 --> 00:35:53.618
AND CONTINUES TO EXCLUDE

00:35:53.684 --> 00:35:55.353
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE NOW I

00:35:55.419 --> 00:35:56.787
APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THAT

00:35:56.854 --> 00:35:57.989
AMENDMENT BUT I THINK AS WAS

00:35:58.055 --> 00:36:00.258
ARTICULATED THAT IS NOT GOING TO

00:36:00.324 --> 00:36:00.491
SOLVE.

00:36:00.558 --> 00:36:02.727
THE PROBLEM -- IN A NEARLY

00:36:02.793 --> 00:36:04.562
SIMILAR BILL FAILED IN THIS

00:36:04.629 --> 00:36:08.933
COMMITTEE LAST YEAR -- BUT OF

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.701
THE THE BILL CREATES A

00:36:10.768 --> 00:36:12.136
PREFERENCE FOR ONE PROTECTED

00:36:12.203 --> 00:36:13.638
GROUP OVER ANOTHER AND THAT

00:36:13.704 --> 00:36:15.439
HISTORICALLY FACES BARRIERS TO

00:36:15.506 --> 00:36:17.241
EMPLOYMENT WERE FIGHTING HARD

00:36:17.308 --> 00:36:19.911
NOW TO LIFT THOSE BARRIERS. FOR

00:36:19.977 --> 00:36:22.146
WOMEN ARE FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR

00:36:22.213 --> 00:36:24.549
THIS PUTS THE THUMB BACK ON IT.

00:36:24.615 --> 00:36:27.218
EVEN THOUGH IT IS FOR A GROUP OF

00:36:27.285 --> 00:36:28.719
THAT I HIGHLY RESPECT.

00:36:28.786 --> 00:36:29.954
BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:33.291
ALREADY PROTECTIONS THEY ARE AND

00:36:33.357 --> 00:36:34.692
AGAIN I I CHOSE STUFF I THINK

00:36:34.759 --> 00:36:36.894
THAT THEPOLICY IS A WRONG ONE

00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:38.629
WHEN WE HAVE SO MANY OTHER

00:36:38.696 --> 00:36:40.131
GROUPS THAT ALSO.

00:36:40.197 --> 00:36:41.866
ARE FIGHTING HARD TO TO GAIN

00:36:41.933 --> 00:36:43.134
THAT LEVEL OF EQUALITY OF

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.704
OPPORTUNITY THAT THIS BILL WILL.

00:36:46.771 --> 00:36:50.875
CREATE -- IT IN GREATER MEASURE

00:36:50.942 --> 00:36:53.110
FOR ONE GROUP OVER ANOTHER SO --

00:36:53.177 --> 00:36:54.745
SENATOR UMBERG I KNOW YOU WANTED

00:36:54.812 --> 00:36:56.981
TO BE RECOGNIZED AND THEN IF

00:36:57.048 --> 00:36:58.783
THERE'S ANYONE ELSE WILL.

00:36:58.849 --> 00:37:01.452
A AND CENTER ON BURKE FALL BY AS

00:37:01.519 --> 00:37:03.888
SENATOR JONES.

00:37:03.955 --> 00:37:07.525
I'M I HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS SO

00:37:07.592 --> 00:37:09.694
ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL -- AT THE

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.028
CONTEST I HAVE A BIAS IN FAVOR

00:37:11.095 --> 00:37:11.896
OF VETERANS IS SO STRONG I

00:37:11.963 --> 00:37:12.697
MARRIED A VETERAN -- AND SHE IS

00:37:12.763 --> 00:37:14.065
ALWAYS OUTRANK ME ONLY BECAUSE

00:37:14.131 --> 00:37:14.732
SHE'S SMARTER AND A BETTER

00:37:14.799 --> 00:37:17.568
LEADER -- BUT IF I TODAY

00:37:17.635 --> 00:37:18.869
ADVERTISE IN NEWSPAPERS SAID I

00:37:18.936 --> 00:37:20.404
HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR HIRING

00:37:20.471 --> 00:37:22.740
VETERANS WHAT WOULD BE THE

00:37:22.807 --> 00:37:24.609
CONSEQUENCE [inaudible]

00:37:24.675 --> 00:37:27.244
SENATOR.

00:37:27.311 --> 00:37:28.879
THE VETERAN COMMUNITY AS YOU

00:37:28.946 --> 00:37:30.848
PROBABLY WELL KNOW IS NOT MADE

00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:33.618
UP OF 16218% [inaudible]

00:37:33.684 --> 00:37:35.453
WOMEN.

00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:38.322
AND GROWING DRAMATICALLY -- THE

00:37:38.389 --> 00:37:40.858
CONSEQUENCE IN THIRTY SEVEN

00:37:40.925 --> 00:37:42.226
OTHER STATES.

00:37:42.293 --> 00:37:45.429
HAS BEEN NO IMPACT WHATSOEVER --

00:37:45.496 --> 00:37:46.497
BUT HERE LET ME MAYBE I SHOULD

00:37:46.564 --> 00:37:48.165
DRESS TO THE OPPOSITION WHAT

00:37:48.232 --> 00:37:49.533
WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCE TODAY

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:50.968
IF IF I SIMPLY PUT AN AD IN

00:37:51.035 --> 00:37:52.903
NEWSPAPERS SAID I HAVE A

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:55.373
PREFERENCE FOR VETERANS.

00:37:55.439 --> 00:37:56.374
ETCETERA CAVENDER COMMITTED

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:57.808
CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION I THINK

00:37:57.875 --> 00:37:59.744
THE CONSEQUENCES THAT THAT WOULD

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:03.214
NOT PROTECT YOU WITH THAT.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.417
PREFERENCE WAS BEING USED -- TO

00:38:06.484 --> 00:38:08.386
GRANT OF SPECIAL TREATMENT TO

00:38:08.452 --> 00:38:09.787
THAT GROUP AT AS A WAY OF

00:38:09.854 --> 00:38:12.189
DISCRIMINATING AGAINST WOMEN OF

00:38:12.256 --> 00:38:13.824
PEOPLE OF COLOR AND OTHER

00:38:13.891 --> 00:38:15.660
PROTECTED CLASSES.

00:38:15.726 --> 00:38:18.062
SO YOU COULD YOU COULD HAVE A

00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:19.430
VETERANS PREFERENCE BUT IF YOUR

00:38:19.497 --> 00:38:21.065
EXERCISE THAT PREFERENCE IN A

00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:22.733
WAY THAT DISCRIMINATES.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.535
AGAINST ANOTHER PROTECTED CLASS

00:38:24.602 --> 00:38:26.370
YOU WOULD BE POTENTIALLY SUBJECT

00:38:26.437 --> 00:38:27.672
TO LIABILITY FOR THAT

00:38:27.738 --> 00:38:30.274
DISCRIMINATION THIS BILL WOULD.

00:38:30.341 --> 00:38:34.045
REMOVE ANY -- PROTECTION FOR

00:38:34.111 --> 00:38:36.380
THOSE OTHER GROUPS.

00:38:36.447 --> 00:38:37.682
OKAY IT AND I ASSUME BY YOUR

00:38:37.748 --> 00:38:39.216
COMMENTS THAT YOU WOULD THINK WE

00:38:39.283 --> 00:38:40.718
SHOULD RISKS AND ANY PREFERENCE

00:38:40.785 --> 00:38:42.987
AND AND GOVERNMENTAL HIRING ALSO

00:38:43.054 --> 00:38:46.057
FOR VETERANS.

00:38:46.123 --> 00:38:47.792
THAT THAT BILL ISN'T BEFORE A

00:38:47.858 --> 00:38:49.360
SLIGHT BUT LET'S NOT.

00:38:49.427 --> 00:38:49.927
LET LET'S SAY I'M A BUT I'M

00:38:49.994 --> 00:38:53.164
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE THE

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:55.399
LOGIC SO WELL.

00:38:55.466 --> 00:38:57.968
I I THINK THAT AGAIN LET'S FOCUS

00:38:58.035 --> 00:39:00.304
ON THE BILL BEFORE US AND IT IF

00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:01.639
SOMEONE WANTS TO BRING THAT

00:39:01.706 --> 00:39:03.607
OTHER BILL RIGHT NOW THEREIS A

00:39:03.674 --> 00:39:06.210
PREFERENCE IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN.

00:39:06.277 --> 00:39:08.079
FOR A IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR THAT

00:39:08.145 --> 00:39:09.714
VETERANS TO GET ADDITIONAL

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:12.450
PREFERENCE -- AND THE BILL HERE

00:39:12.516 --> 00:39:14.852
IS TO TRY TO CREATE THAT ALSO

00:39:14.919 --> 00:39:15.953
FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR AS

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.521
COMPARED TO TAKING THAT

00:39:17.588 --> 00:39:19.390
PREFERENCE IN GETTING RID OF IT

00:39:19.457 --> 00:39:20.925
ON ALL LEVELS SO.

00:39:20.991 --> 00:39:23.294
I THINK THAT THE AGAIN.

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.729
I WOULD APPRECIATE GIVEN OUR

00:39:24.795 --> 00:39:26.964
CALENDAR TODAY WE FOCUS ON THE

00:39:27.031 --> 00:39:29.066
BILL'S AT HAND -- BUT LET ME ASK

00:39:29.133 --> 00:39:30.901
THE QUESTION THE OPPOSITION IF

00:39:30.968 --> 00:39:33.370
FOR EXAMPLE THIS BILL SAID

00:39:33.437 --> 00:39:34.872
DISABLED VETERANS WOULD THAT

00:39:34.939 --> 00:39:36.974
MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE

00:39:37.041 --> 00:39:38.976
OPPOSITION. TO EITHER A SO YOU

00:39:39.043 --> 00:39:42.379
ARE QUALITY CALIFORNIA.

00:39:42.446 --> 00:39:43.347
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD CENTER

00:39:43.414 --> 00:39:45.015
AND BUT I'D HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

00:39:45.082 --> 00:39:46.684
THAT MORE BUT MY MY FIRST

00:39:46.751 --> 00:39:47.818
REACTION IS THAT I'M I'M NOT

00:39:47.885 --> 00:39:48.419
SURE THAT YOU YOU WANT TO GO

00:39:48.486 --> 00:39:50.321
DOWN THAT ROAD ANY MORE THAN YOU

00:39:50.387 --> 00:39:50.988
WANT TO GO DOWN THIS ROAD.

00:39:51.055 --> 00:39:51.722
I MEAN I I THINK THERE IS A

00:39:51.789 --> 00:39:53.557
QUALITY TO SO FOR EXAMPLE IF I

00:39:53.624 --> 00:39:55.392
EVER TIES AND SAID I WANT.

00:39:55.459 --> 00:39:56.961
A QUALIFIED CANDIDATE IS A

00:39:57.027 --> 00:39:58.829
COLLEGE EDUCATION.

00:39:58.896 --> 00:39:59.697
RIGHT I COULD THERE'S NO PROBLEM

00:39:59.764 --> 00:40:01.699
WITH THAT BUT IF I SAID I WANT

00:40:01.766 --> 00:40:04.568
SOMEONE THAT HAS EXPERIENCE IN

00:40:04.635 --> 00:40:06.203
AN ORGANIZED ENVIRONMENT WHERE

00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:10.141
THE MISSION TRANSCENDS SELF

00:40:10.207 --> 00:40:10.341
RIGHT.

00:40:10.407 --> 00:40:11.375
BY SAID THAT.

00:40:11.442 --> 00:40:12.943
AND IN SAID THAT THAT WOULD THAT

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:15.012
WOULD DISTINGUISH AN ANNEX

00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:16.881
IDENTIFY VETERANS THAT WOULD BE.

00:40:16.947 --> 00:40:17.948
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THAT WOULD

00:40:18.015 --> 00:40:18.682
BE ILLEGAL [inaudible]

00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:22.953
WELL. FOR THE CHERRY IT'S IF I

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:23.420
MAY.

00:40:23.487 --> 00:40:25.656
ANY PREFERENCE FOR A JOB RELATED

00:40:25.723 --> 00:40:28.225
SKILLS OR ABILITIES IS CERTAINLY

00:40:28.292 --> 00:40:30.761
APPROPRIATE NON DISCRIMINATORY.

00:40:30.828 --> 00:40:34.899
OKAY SO IF THIS BILL SAID THAT.

00:40:34.965 --> 00:40:36.500
WELL I'LL I'LL I'LL STOP THE

00:40:36.567 --> 00:40:39.103
HYPOTHETICALS -- OKAY OKAY THANK

ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'D LET ME JUST

00:50:14.311 --> 00:50:15.679
ADD THAT I THINK THE REASON THAT

00:50:15.746 --> 00:50:17.647
THEY COMMIT SUICIDE IS MORE TO

00:50:17.714 --> 00:50:20.083

CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

AND WERE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO

01:02:16.265 --> 01:02:18.501
THIS BILL -- WHICH ESTABLISHES

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:20.036
AUTOMATIC JOINT LIABILITY FOR

01:02:20.103 --> 01:02:21.304

01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:25.208
CONTRACTORS LIABLE.

01:02:25.274 --> 01:02:25.842
WE ACTUALLY THINK THE COMMITTEE

01:02:25.908 --> 01:02:26.909
ANALYSIS DID A VERY GOOD JOB ON

01:02:26.976 --> 01:02:28.311
THIS POINT AND CLARIFIED THAT

01:02:28.377 --> 01:02:29.912
THIS IS IN FACT AN AUTOMATIC

01:02:29.979 --> 01:02:31.280
JOINT LIABILITY BILL.

01:02:31.347 --> 01:02:32.982
I THINK THERE'D BEEN SOME MONEY

01:02:33.049 --> 01:02:34.250
IN OF THE WATERS OF THAT POINT A

01:02:34.317 --> 01:02:36.018
PRIOR CONVERSATIONS BUT THIS

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:37.987
COMMITTEE AND ALSO SAYS THAT IS

01:02:38.054 --> 01:02:40.656
RIGHT ON AND IT STATES -- IF THE

01:02:40.723 --> 01:02:42.091
LABOR CONTRACTORS LIABLE FOR THE

01:02:42.158 --> 01:02:43.192
WORKPLACE HARASSMENT IN THE

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:45.161
CLIENT EMPLOYERS AUTOMATICALLY

01:02:45.228 --> 01:02:46.028
LIABLE FOR THAT WORKPLACE

01:02:46.095 --> 01:02:46.629
HARASSMENT.

01:02:46.696 --> 01:02:48.431
AS WELL AND THAT'S THE NATURE OF

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:49.866
ARE CONCERNED WE DON'T WE THINK

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:51.234
THERE ARE SITUATIONS THAT WE CAN

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.735
ALL ENVISIONED WHERE PROBABLY

01:02:52.802 --> 01:02:54.370
MAKES SENSE TO HOLD THE LINE

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:55.638
PLAYER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LABOR

01:02:55.705 --> 01:02:56.772
CONTRACTORS.

01:02:56.839 --> 01:02:58.040
ACTIVITIES WHERE THERE'S THE

01:02:58.107 --> 01:03:00.042
REQUISITE LEVEL OF OF CONTROLLER

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:01.444
KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE SITUATION

01:03:01.511 --> 01:03:02.979
BUT WE CAN PROBABLY ALSO IMAGINE

01:03:03.045 --> 01:03:04.280
SITUATIONS WHERE.

01:03:04.347 --> 01:03:05.548
THE CLIENT EMPLOYER HAS NO

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:06.916
KNOWLEDGE OR NO CONTROL OF THE

01:03:06.983 --> 01:03:08.551
SEXUAL HARASSMENT ACTIVITY

01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:09.685
OCCURRING.

01:03:09.752 --> 01:03:11.687
AND WE THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE --

01:03:11.754 --> 01:03:12.755
TO HOLD THEM AUTOMATICALLY

01:03:12.822 --> 01:03:15.124
LIABLE IN THAT SITUATION.

01:03:15.191 --> 01:03:16.092
AND I JUST WANT TO DIRECT THE

01:03:16.159 --> 01:03:17.393
COMMITTEE TO PAGE FIVE OF THE

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:19.729
ANALYSIS WHERE THEY TALK ABOUT

01:03:19.795 --> 01:03:21.898
HOW THE SCENARIO WILL PLAY OUT --

01:03:21.964 --> 01:03:22.932
AND IT SAYS UNDER THIS BILL THE

01:03:22.999 --> 01:03:24.901
CLIENT EMPLOYERS JOINTLY LIABLE

01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:26.002
FOR WORKPLACE HARASSMENT.

01:03:26.068 --> 01:03:26.936
THAT THE LABOR CONTRACTOR KNEW

01:03:27.003 --> 01:03:28.237
OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT EVEN

01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:29.572
IF THE CLIENT EMPLOYER ITSELF

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:30.506
DID NOT HAVE ACTUAL OR

01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:32.275
CONSTRUCTIVE KNOWLEDGE.

01:03:32.341 --> 01:03:33.376
ABOUT THEIR HARASSMENT.

01:03:33.442 --> 01:03:34.644
THUS IF THE LABOR CONTRACTOR

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:35.845
DIRECTLY HARASSED WORKER

01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:36.779
SUPPLIED BY THE LABOR

01:03:36.846 --> 01:03:38.014
CONTRACTORS IN THE PLANE OF

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.282
WHERE WOULD BE JOINTLY LIABLE

01:03:39.348 --> 01:03:40.383
WITH THE LABOR CONTRACTOR FOR

01:03:40.449 --> 01:03:41.484
THAT HARASSMENT.

01:03:41.551 --> 01:03:44.487
EVEN IF THE CLIENT EMPLOYER DID

01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:45.021
NOT KNOW ABOUT IT WHEN IT

01:03:45.087 --> 01:03:45.888
OCCURRED.

01:03:45.955 --> 01:03:46.889
SIMILARLY IF ONE WORKER SUPPLIED

01:03:46.956 --> 01:03:48.191
BY THE LABOR CONTRACTOR FOR US

01:03:48.257 --> 01:03:49.592
ANOTHER WORKER SUPPLIED BY THE

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:50.893
LABOR CONTRACTOR.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.461
AND THE LABOR CONTRACTOR KNEW OR

01:03:52.528 --> 01:03:53.029
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE

01:03:53.095 --> 01:03:54.397
HARASSMENT BUT DID NOT TAKE

01:03:54.463 --> 01:03:55.464
ACTION TO STOP IT.

01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:56.265
THEN THE CLIENT EMPLOYER WOULD

01:03:56.332 --> 01:03:58.067
BE JOINTLY LIABLE WITH THE LABOR

01:03:58.134 --> 01:03:59.769
CONTRACTOR FOR THAT HARASSMENT.

01:03:59.835 --> 01:04:01.037
EVEN IF THE CLIENT EMPLOYER

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:02.572
ITSELF DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS

01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:04.307
GOING ON IN TIME.

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:05.474
SO AGAIN WE THINK IT'S

01:04:05.541 --> 01:04:07.343
INAPPROPRIATE TO AUTOMATICALLY

01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:08.811
HOLD DECLINE EMPLOYER LIABLE IN

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:10.913
THAT SITUATION AND WE THINK THE

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:12.248
COMMON LAW TEST WITH LOOKS AT

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:13.950
THE LEVEL OF CONTROL IS THE IS

01:04:14.016 --> 01:04:15.351
THE BEST BALANCE OF OF

01:04:15.418 --> 01:04:16.719
APPORTIONING LIABILITY IN

01:04:16.786 --> 01:04:18.454
SITUATION.

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:19.488
AND FINALLY THE ALE THE ONLY

01:04:19.555 --> 01:04:20.957
OTHER POINT I WANTED TO MAKE IS.

01:04:21.023 --> 01:04:22.525
THE EXISTING JOINT LIABILITY

01:04:22.592 --> 01:04:23.960
SECTION LABOR CODE TWENTY TEN

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:25.394
POINT THREE WHICH EXTEND

01:04:25.461 --> 01:04:27.430
LIABILITY TO WAGES AND WORKERS

01:04:27.496 --> 01:04:29.031
COMP -- THOSE ARE MORE

01:04:29.098 --> 01:04:30.666
OBJECTIVELY VERIFIABLE -- THE

01:04:30.733 --> 01:04:32.568
MANAGER OF THAT BILL WAS VOTE

01:04:32.635 --> 01:04:34.337
YOUR CONTRACTORS I THINK THAT'S

01:04:34.403 --> 01:04:35.771
EASIER TO DO WHEN IT COMES TO

01:04:35.838 --> 01:04:38.007
WAGES AND WORKERS COMPENSATION

01:04:38.074 --> 01:04:39.041
YOU CAN VERIFY WORKERS

01:04:39.108 --> 01:04:40.776
COMPENSATION COVERAGE BY MAKING

01:04:40.843 --> 01:04:42.845
A PHONE CALL.

01:04:42.912 --> 01:04:44.480
YOU CAN DO A PAIR AUDIT.

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:46.215
WE DON'T BELIEVE THE TYPES OF

01:04:46.282 --> 01:04:47.550
ISSUES RELATED TO SEXUAL

01:04:47.617 --> 01:04:49.352
HARASSMENT ARE NECESSARILY AS

01:04:49.418 --> 01:04:50.586
OBJECTIVE FIVE LEAVE VERIFY

01:04:50.653 --> 01:04:52.622

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.021

EMPLOYERS THAT HAVE ONLY FIVE A

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:02.124

WORKPLACE HARASSMENT IN THOSE

WORKPLACE HARASSMENT THAT YOU'RE

01:06:16.839 --> 01:06:18.341
TRYING TO STAMP OUT.

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:19.942
IT THAT WAS THAT WAS TAKEN FROM

01:06:20.009 --> 01:06:22.578
THE LABOR CODE ON ON OUR WAGE

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:24.380
ISSUES AND WORKERS COMP ISSUES

01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:26.315
ONE THE REASONS IS -- AND LET'S

01:06:26.382 --> 01:06:27.416
TAKE LIKE.

01:06:27.483 --> 01:06:29.018
A HIRING HALL FOR EXAMPLE --

01:06:29.085 --> 01:06:30.453
THAT IS DISTRIBUTING THEIR

01:06:30.519 --> 01:06:32.488
WORKERS TO A PLACE OF BUSINESS

01:06:32.555 --> 01:06:36.492
IS MAYBE THAT THE ACTUAL --

01:06:36.559 --> 01:06:37.727

01:06:40.129 --> 01:06:42.965
IT NOTES IS NOT ON SITE THEY'RE

01:06:43.032 --> 01:06:44.133
NOT.

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.402
PARTICIPATING IN ANY WAY IT'S

01:06:46.469 --> 01:06:48.637
JUST A UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP AND

01:06:48.704 --> 01:06:50.139
WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT WITH --

01:06:50.206 --> 01:06:51.707
WITH THE CONSULTANT ABOUT

01:06:51.774 --> 01:06:52.775
WHETHER WE NEEDED TO TRANSFER

01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:55.244
BUT WE WE HAVE GONE BACK AND

01:06:55.311 --> 01:06:55.978
FORTH BETWEEN THE LABOR CODE IF

01:06:56.045 --> 01:06:57.346
YOU HAVE WITH US WELL TO BE

01:06:57.413 --> 01:06:58.381
HONEST AND IT'S BEEN TOUGH -- TO

01:06:58.447 --> 01:06:59.849
EVERY EVERY TIME WE PUT IT

01:06:59.915 --> 01:07:01.117
SOMEWHERE THE OPPOSITION SAYS IT

01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:02.985
DOESN'T BELONG THERE -- BUT WE

01:07:03.052 --> 01:07:04.687
HAD WORK WE DECIDED TO STICK

01:07:04.754 --> 01:07:07.590
WITH THE HAT DESPITE MY BELIEF

01:07:07.656 --> 01:07:08.691
THAT IT SHOULD BE IN LABOR CODE

01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:09.592
BUT IF IT'S THE LABOR CODE.

01:07:09.658 --> 01:07:10.726
THE DEFINITIONS FOR SEXUAL

01:07:10.793 --> 01:07:11.861
HARASSMENT WOULD HAVE TO BE

01:07:11.927 --> 01:07:13.529
TRANSFERRED TO LABOR CODE SO WE

01:07:13.596 --> 01:07:15.264
SETTLED ON FEE HAT AND WE TRIED

01:07:15.331 --> 01:07:18.267
TO TAKE ALL OF THE SECTIONS THAT.

01:07:18.334 --> 01:07:19.568
MATCHED THE THE STRICT LIABILITY

01:07:19.635 --> 01:07:21.203
OR THE JOINT LIABILITY IN THE

01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:24.407
LABOR CODE AND PUT IT INTO THE

01:07:24.473 --> 01:07:25.107
HUNDRED THE SECTION SO THAT'S

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:25.741
WHY THOSE ARE THERE ANY KIND OF

01:07:25.808 --> 01:07:27.810
A REAL EXAMPLE IN IN A REASONING --

01:07:27.877 --> 01:07:29.111
WE'RE WILLING TO CONTINUE TO

01:07:29.178 --> 01:07:32.915
WORK ON WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S

01:07:32.982 --> 01:07:34.283

COLLEAGUES -- QUESTION.

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:29.798

THE IDEA OF LABOR CONTRACTORS --

01:09:35.471 --> 01:09:36.906

IF IT.

01:09:50.619 --> 01:09:53.455
SATISFIES ONE OF THE CRITERIA.

01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:54.490
AND THAT IS THAT THEY ARE

01:09:54.557 --> 01:09:55.591
SIGNATORY TO A COLLECTIVE

01:09:55.658 --> 01:09:56.926
BARGAINING AGREEMENT

01:09:56.992 --> 01:09:57.226
[inaudible]

01:09:57.293 --> 01:10:00.362
IS THAT.

01:10:00.429 --> 01:10:01.330
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

01:10:01.397 --> 01:10:02.665
NONTRADITIONAL LABOR CONTRACTORS

01:10:02.731 --> 01:10:04.733
OF YOUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.635
PAYROLL SERVICE.

01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:08.504
THE WAY WE AND SHORE -- QUITE

01:10:08.571 --> 01:10:09.705
FRANKLY OF OTHER BILLS TO DEAL

01:10:09.772 --> 01:10:11.874
WITH THIS NOW THE WAY WE ENSURE

01:10:11.941 --> 01:10:14.410
THAT -- THESE FORMERLY WHAT WE

01:10:14.476 --> 01:10:15.210
THOUGHT OF IS KIND OF GIG

01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:17.546
WORKERS ARE ACTUAL EMPLOYEES AND

01:10:17.613 --> 01:10:19.515
NOT -- CONTRACTED JUST

01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:21.383
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IS YOU

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:22.251
HAVE TO HAVE AN EMPLOYER OF

01:10:22.318 --> 01:10:23.786
RECORD AND PAYROLL SERVICE

01:10:23.852 --> 01:10:25.120
BASICALLY ACTS AS THAT BUT THEY

01:10:25.187 --> 01:10:27.756
IN NO WAY HAVE CONTROL OVER --

01:10:27.823 --> 01:10:30.426
THE WORKPLACE OF THAT WORKER SO

01:10:30.492 --> 01:10:32.928
IT IS -- A UNIQUE SITUATION BY

01:10:32.995 --> 01:10:36.832
WHICH YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE --

01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:38.467
I TRUST IN A UNION -- THAT THEY

01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:39.868
ARE ABLE TO REMAIN EMPLOYEES AND

01:10:39.935 --> 01:10:41.870
YET BE WORKING FOR A MULTIPLE

01:10:41.937 --> 01:10:42.838
DIFFERENT.

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.974
EMPLOYERS IF YOU WILL EVERY DAY

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.343
HE DIFFERENT EMPLOYERS IF IN --

01:10:47.409 --> 01:10:49.011
IT WORKS SO WE CAN TELL OVER

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:51.113
LIVE THAT THIS HAPPENS -- IT'S

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:52.648
THE WAY IT'S BEEN CONSTRUCTED SO

01:10:52.715 --> 01:10:54.149
YOU CAN'T HOLD THE PAYROLL

01:10:54.216 --> 01:10:57.052
SERVICE WHO IS NOT AT THE PLACE

01:10:57.119 --> 01:10:58.687
OF BUSINESS WHO IS NOT.

01:10:58.754 --> 01:11:00.656
HAVING ANY INTERACTION BUT

01:11:00.723 --> 01:11:02.124
PROVIDING THE WORK FORCE IN THE

01:11:02.191 --> 01:11:04.460
PAYROLL AND TAKING OUT THE TAXES

01:11:04.526 --> 01:11:06.428
AND DOES THAT MAKE SENSE I'M

01:11:06.495 --> 01:11:07.997
TRYING TO MAKE -- IF ANYONE CAN

01:11:08.063 --> 01:11:09.264
CHIME IN WITH THE NAME WHAT WAS

01:11:09.331 --> 01:11:11.066
THE NAME OF THE THE COURT

01:11:11.133 --> 01:11:15.104
DECISION ON IS.

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:16.438
THAT SAID OR DONE THAT THAT'S I

01:11:16.505 --> 01:11:17.139
HAVE ANOTHER BILL I'M NOT AND

01:11:17.206 --> 01:11:18.507
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF THE

01:11:18.574 --> 01:11:20.943
MOVEMENT OF A THROUGH THAT --

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:22.911
THROUGH THAT CASE LAW IS THAT

01:11:22.978 --> 01:11:25.514
INDIVIDUALS ON EVEN IF THEY'RE

01:11:25.581 --> 01:11:28.984
PART TIME CONTRACT -- TâM.

01:11:29.051 --> 01:11:30.119
WOULD FALL UNDER THE CATEGORY OF

01:11:30.185 --> 01:11:32.254
EMPLOYEE.

01:11:32.321 --> 01:11:34.256
HOW DOES THAT BEAR OUT WITH THE

01:11:34.323 --> 01:11:35.524
IDEA THAT?

01:11:35.591 --> 01:11:39.728
I ANY INTERMEDIARY WOOD.

01:11:39.795 --> 01:11:40.829
THE SITUATION JOINT LIABILITY

01:11:40.896 --> 01:11:42.731
WITH THE EMPLOYER.

01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:44.967
THOSE ARE TWO SEPARATE CONCEPTS --

01:11:45.034 --> 01:11:46.935
AND IN SOME WAYS I COULD GIVE

01:11:47.002 --> 01:11:49.772
YOU THIS EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW IT IS

01:11:49.838 --> 01:11:52.941
IN COURT DEFENDING AGAINST -- OF

01:11:53.008 --> 01:11:55.744
RAPE CHARGES -- THAT THEY HAVE

01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:57.112
NO CONTROL OVER BECAUSE THEIR

01:11:57.179 --> 01:11:58.914
DRIVER THEY SAY IS A SEPARATE

01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:00.983
BUSINESS SO IN SOME WAYS WE'RE

01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:02.451
TRYING TO FIX THAT RIGHT WE'RE

01:12:02.518 --> 01:12:03.719
TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THERE SOME

01:12:03.786 --> 01:12:07.389
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COMPANY.

01:12:07.456 --> 01:12:11.960
THAT UNDER THEIR MISGUIDED.

01:12:12.027 --> 01:12:13.362
BELIEF THAT THEY'RE FOLLOWING

01:12:13.429 --> 01:12:14.930
THE LAW THEY THEY ARE A MASTER

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:17.099
COMPANY A CONTRACTING WITH THESE

01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:19.001
WORKERS THESE WORKERS -- THESE

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:21.003
CONTRACTED WORKERS RAPE SOMEBODY

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:22.104
AND THEY'RE SAYING WE HAVE NO

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:24.540
RESPONSIBILITY -- ONE OF THE

01:12:24.606 --> 01:12:26.241
EASIEST WAYS TO FIX THIS IS TO

01:12:26.308 --> 01:12:28.177
BE CLEAR THAT THOSE ARE WORKERS

01:12:28.243 --> 01:12:30.179
OF THE COMPANY.

01:12:30.245 --> 01:12:32.114
IF THEY WERE USING A TEMPORARY

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:34.750
AGENCY HOWEVER WE HAVE TO BE

01:12:34.817 --> 01:12:35.584
MORE CLEAR THAT THAT TEMPER

01:12:35.651 --> 01:12:38.587
AGENT TEMPORARY AGENCY.

01:12:38.654 --> 01:12:41.123
BUT THEY STILL WERE RESPONSIBLE.

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:42.825
OKAY SO IS THAT MAKES SENSE THIS

01:12:42.891 --> 01:12:44.960
IS LIKE A LOT OF LABOR LAW THAT

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:45.694
CROSS.

01:12:45.761 --> 01:12:47.763
HIS TOGETHER I'D BE HAPPY TO SIT

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:48.864
DOWN WITH YOU AND AND IT'S LIKE

01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:50.332
ALMOST A DIAGRAM RIGHT I'M

01:12:50.399 --> 01:12:51.667
TRYING I'M TRYING TO APPRECIATE

01:12:51.734 --> 01:12:53.402
THE COMPLEXITY MORE IMPORTANTLY

01:12:53.469 --> 01:12:54.470
I'M TRYING.

01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:56.472
TO CONTEMPLATE UNINTENDED

01:12:56.538 --> 01:12:57.339
CONSEQUENCES.

01:12:57.406 --> 01:12:59.541
AND I WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT

01:12:59.608 --> 01:13:01.777
WE'RE NOT IN A SITUATION WHERE.

01:13:01.844 --> 01:13:04.747
BY THIS LEGISLATION -- CREATING

01:13:04.813 --> 01:13:08.117
JOINT LIABILITY THAT EAT THAT

01:13:08.183 --> 01:13:11.253
THIS IS NOT OUR FOR CLOSING --

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:14.056
THE THE CONTRACTING OUT OF LABOR

01:13:14.123 --> 01:13:15.357
MAKING CERTAIN THAT EVERYTHING

01:13:15.424 --> 01:13:17.793
IS DONE IN HOUSE BY VIRTUE

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:19.328
MAKING EVERYONE AN EMPLOYEE.

01:13:19.394 --> 01:13:21.697
AND THAT IN THIS GIG ECONOMY

01:13:21.764 --> 01:13:23.599
COULD BE TERRIBLY DANGEROUS --

01:13:23.665 --> 01:13:26.435
IN THAT IS OF OF CONCERN BUT ALL

01:13:26.502 --> 01:13:28.237
A LEAVE MY FINAL COMMENTS HERE.

01:13:28.303 --> 01:13:31.440
THAT THE IDEA OF AN EMPLOYER.

01:13:31.507 --> 01:13:33.609
OR A PRINCIPLE ENTITY

01:13:33.675 --> 01:13:35.878
CONTRACTING WITH AN INTERMEDIARY

01:13:35.944 --> 01:13:37.346
FOR SERVICE IS BEING --

01:13:37.412 --> 01:13:40.916
PERFORMED BY -- ANOTHER PARTY.

01:13:40.983 --> 01:13:42.351
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS THAT

01:13:42.417 --> 01:13:44.052
IS THE CASE LAW NOT SUFFICIENT

01:13:44.119 --> 01:13:47.156
ENOUGH THAT IF IN INDIVIDUALS

01:13:47.222 --> 01:13:50.025
HIRED -- AND HAS A SEXUAL

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:53.228
PREDATORY A CRIMINAL RECORD.

01:13:53.295 --> 01:13:56.431
THAT THEY COULD NOT -- ASSUME

01:13:56.498 --> 01:13:58.167
LIABILITY HERB PROJECT LIABILITY

01:13:58.233 --> 01:14:01.703
ON TO THE ENTITY THAT HIRED --

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:05.007
THE THERE'S NOT ONLY I MEAN

01:14:05.073 --> 01:14:05.941
THAT'S A UNIQUE CASE BUT THAT

01:14:06.008 --> 01:14:07.676
THAT'S NOT ALWAYS A SITUATION

01:14:07.743 --> 01:14:08.610
IT'S NOT THAT THEY HAVE A

01:14:08.677 --> 01:14:09.978
PREDATORY BEHAVIOR IT'S THAT.

01:14:10.045 --> 01:14:11.880
I'M QUITE FRANKLY AND AND WE SEE

01:14:11.947 --> 01:14:12.648
THIS IN A LOT OF IMMIGRANT WORK

01:14:12.714 --> 01:14:14.516
FORCES -- MANY OF THE WORKERS

01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:15.818
DON'T KNOW THE LAW AND WE'RE

01:14:15.884 --> 01:14:17.486
TRYING TO FIX THAT WE'VE WE'VE

01:14:17.553 --> 01:14:19.621
HAD BILLS -- IN THE PAST TO FIX

01:14:19.688 --> 01:14:21.123
IT WITH FARMWORKERS AND WITH

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:22.691
JANITORS BECAUSE BOTH THE WORKER

01:14:22.758 --> 01:14:24.259
AND THE SUPERVISORS WHO ARE

01:14:24.326 --> 01:14:26.628
OFTEN I'M IMMIGRANTS THEMSELVES

01:14:26.695 --> 01:14:27.629
DON'T.

01:14:27.696 --> 01:14:29.531

IN THE CODE ALREADY BUT WE

TRADITIONALLY OPPOSED

01:23:52.093 --> 01:23:54.496
STATUTORILY CREATING --

01:23:54.562 --> 01:23:56.331
PRESUMPTIONS OF LIABILITY.

01:23:56.398 --> 01:23:57.198

REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION AND THAT

01:24:01.503 --> 01:24:02.670
BILL WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR

01:24:02.737 --> 01:24:03.805
THIS BILL HAS A NINETY DAY

01:24:03.872 --> 01:24:06.608
REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION SO IT'S

01:24:06.674 --> 01:24:07.175

OUR FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN THOUGH

01:24:08.877 --> 01:24:11.479

01:24:14.082 --> 01:24:15.116
CODE.

01:24:15.183 --> 01:24:16.418
WE THINK SUCH HARASSMENT IS A

01:24:16.484 --> 01:24:18.686
BODY OF LAW IS IN THE GOVERNMENT

01:24:18.753 --> 01:24:19.888
CODE -- IT MINISTER THAN

01:24:19.954 --> 01:24:21.022

WE HAVE CONCERNS WHEN YOU PUT

01:24:24.692 --> 01:24:25.994
ALL ENTIRE BODY OF LAW INTO THE

ENFORCED BY DIFFERENT AGENCY

01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:29.998
THAT'S THAT'S GONNA RESULT AN

01:24:30.064 --> 01:24:33.635
INCONSISTENCY -- AND CONFUSION.

01:24:33.701 --> 01:24:35.203
THE PREVIOUS BILL WE SPOKE ABOUT

01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:36.538
WAS A SEXUAL HARASSMENT MEASURE

01:24:36.604 --> 01:24:37.806
THAT BILL AS THE AUTHOR

01:24:37.872 --> 01:24:39.774
INDICATED WAS CONTAINED IN FIFA

01:24:39.841 --> 01:24:41.476

LABOR CODE.

01:24:44.712 --> 01:24:45.947

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:06.668
AS SUCH DISCRIMINATION OR SCREAM

01:25:06.734 --> 01:25:08.236
NATION CLAIMS ARE ALREADY WITHIN

01:25:08.303 --> 01:25:09.404
THE PURVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

SIMILAR REASONS WE BELIEVE IT'S

01:25:21.382 --> 01:25:23.284
INAPPROPRIATE TO INCORPORATE

01:25:23.351 --> 01:25:24.719
THESE THESE PROVISIONS IN THE

01:39:53.554 --> 01:39:55.055
LISTENING I WAS THINKING THAT OF

01:39:55.122 --> 01:39:58.125
THE CASE OF THE YOUNG BOY WHO.

01:39:58.192 --> 01:40:00.327
HAD BEEN SEXUALLY ABUSED AND

01:40:00.394 --> 01:40:03.731
ULTIMATELY -- ENDED HIS LIFE.

01:40:03.797 --> 01:40:05.699
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY STORES

01:40:05.766 --> 01:40:08.035
I'VE HEARD OF YOUNG -- YOUNG

01:40:08.102 --> 01:40:09.403
BOYS AND GIRLS YOUNG MEN AND

01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:10.337
WOMEN.

01:40:10.404 --> 01:40:11.805
WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO THIS DAY

01:40:11.872 --> 01:40:13.574
AND HOPEFULLY WON'T END UP DOING

01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:14.675
THAT BUT THE?

01:40:14.742 --> 01:40:17.444
THE INCIDENCE OF THIS KIND OF

01:40:17.511 --> 01:40:18.946
ABUSE IS TRUST.

01:40:19.012 --> 01:40:23.217
HARD TO GET ONE'S ARMS AROUND IT

01:40:23.283 --> 01:40:26.920
IS JUST -- IT'S TRAGIC AND

01:40:26.987 --> 01:40:28.322
THAT'S ABOUT AS MILD THE WORDS I

01:40:28.389 --> 01:40:31.959
CAN USE AND SO -- I THINK WE ARE

01:40:32.025 --> 01:40:33.427
AND WE IN THIS COMMITTEE HAVE

01:40:33.494 --> 01:40:35.529
BEEN RELUCTANT TO EXPAND STATURE

01:40:35.596 --> 01:40:37.297
TO LIMITATIONS BECAUSE THERE'S A

01:40:37.364 --> 01:40:38.632
REASON THAT WE HAVE THEM.

01:40:38.699 --> 01:40:40.067
THINGS ARE FRESHER IN PEOPLE'S

01:40:40.134 --> 01:40:42.002
MINDS TO TETRA BUT WE DO KNOW

01:40:42.069 --> 01:40:43.203
WHEN IT COMES TO THIS KIND OF

01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:46.240
SEXUAL ASSAULT SEXUAL ABUSE.

01:40:46.306 --> 01:40:48.509
THAT PEOPLE TEND TO TRY TO BURY

01:40:48.575 --> 01:40:50.911
IT DEEP UNTIL SOMETHING AT SOME

01:40:50.978 --> 01:40:52.379
POINT IN TIME AND WE DON'T

01:40:52.446 --> 01:40:53.714
NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT.

01:40:53.781 --> 01:40:58.318
OR WHY OR HOW IT'S INVOKED AGAIN.

01:40:58.385 --> 01:41:01.121
ARE THEY OUT OF THE EFFORT TO

01:41:01.188 --> 01:41:02.790
COME TO TERMS WITH THIS REALLY

01:41:02.856 --> 01:41:05.025
DOES REQUIRE THAT WE PROVIDE

01:41:05.092 --> 01:41:06.660
THAT OPPORTUNITY TO THESE

01:41:06.727 --> 01:41:09.196
VICTIMS -- I KNOW THE CONCERNS

01:41:09.263 --> 01:41:11.198
AND I HAVE DISCUSSES WITH MY OWN

01:41:11.265 --> 01:41:13.267
SCHOOL A COMMUNITY THAT THAT

01:41:13.333 --> 01:41:15.269
SHARES THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE

01:41:15.335 --> 01:41:18.439
INDUSTRY ABOUT THE COSTS -- AND

01:41:18.505 --> 01:41:19.940
THE FACT THAT THE OSTENSIBLY

01:41:20.007 --> 01:41:21.341
THERE'S REALLY NOTHING HERE TO

01:41:21.408 --> 01:41:23.310
DO PREVENTION I THINK THERE ARE

01:41:23.377 --> 01:41:25.212
A LOT OF BILLS OUT THERE WE JUST

01:41:25.279 --> 01:41:27.214
HEARD A COUPLE -- I KNOW I'VE

01:41:27.281 --> 01:41:28.849
DONE SOME HOPEFULLY THERE IS A

01:41:28.916 --> 01:41:30.751
LOT OF PREVENTION OUT THERE AND

01:41:30.818 --> 01:41:31.685
IF THE SCHOOLS DON'T KNOW ABOUT

01:41:31.752 --> 01:41:33.887
IT YET GO BACK AND READ ALL THE

01:41:33.954 --> 01:41:34.721
VARIOUS.

01:41:34.788 --> 01:41:36.423
LAWS THAT WE PUT INTO EFFECT

01:41:36.490 --> 01:41:38.659
LAST YEAR -- AND OVER THE COURSE

01:41:38.725 --> 01:41:40.961
OF TIME TO DEAL WITH PREVENTION

01:41:41.028 --> 01:41:42.763
THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR CANNOT BE

01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:45.699
TOLERATED SO -- THE THE LENGTH

01:41:45.766 --> 01:41:47.868
OF THE LIMITATIONS PERIOD I

01:41:47.935 --> 01:41:50.037
WOULD NOTE -- THE CONNECTICUT

01:41:50.103 --> 01:41:51.104
PROVIDES.

01:41:51.171 --> 01:41:52.940
NEARLY AN ADDITIONAL DECADE

01:41:53.006 --> 01:41:54.608
BEYOND -- TO WHAT IS SET BY THIS

01:41:54.675 --> 01:41:56.810
BILL AND THAT MASSACHUSETTS EVEN

01:41:56.877 --> 01:41:57.644
MORE.

01:41:57.711 --> 01:41:59.213
ARE CLEARLY MAKING A POLICY

01:41:59.279 --> 01:42:01.482
DETERMINATION THAT THE AGREE

01:42:01.548 --> 01:42:04.017
JUST US I THINK OF WHAT WE'RE

01:42:04.084 --> 01:42:04.818
TALKING ABOUT AND I APPRECIATE

01:42:04.885 --> 01:42:06.186
THE ATTORNEY COMING IN

01:42:06.253 --> 01:42:07.988
REFERENCING ALL THE INSTANCES

01:42:08.055 --> 01:42:09.122
WHERE PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO

01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:10.090
COME.

01:42:10.157 --> 01:42:12.493
AND REDRESS GRIEVANCES -- FOR

01:42:12.559 --> 01:42:14.628
FOR BEHAVIOR AND AND NEGLIGENCE

01:42:14.695 --> 01:42:16.797
AND INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF OF

01:42:16.864 --> 01:42:18.932
HARMON DISTRESS -- BUT THE

01:42:18.999 --> 01:42:23.403
EGREGIOUS NOUS OF THESE ACTS

01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:25.339
SPECIAL TREATMENT UNDER THE LAW

01:42:25.405 --> 01:42:26.273
AND I THINK WE HAVE TO

01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:27.875
DISTINGUISH THAT FROM SOME OF

01:42:27.941 --> 01:42:29.710
THESE OTHER INSTANCES SO.

01:42:29.776 --> 01:42:30.844
WITH THAT I THINK WAS A

01:42:30.911 --> 01:42:33.614
GENTLEMAN BACK THERE WHO --

01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:35.949
INDICATED THE ENLISTED SOME OF

01:42:36.016 --> 01:42:38.018
THE THE LITANY OF ISSUES WHERE

01:42:38.085 --> 01:42:39.253
NOW I GUESS IT WAS YOU SIR --

01:42:39.319 --> 01:42:40.554
AND THEIR THEIR SIGNIFICANT BUT

01:42:40.621 --> 01:42:41.421
I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE A

01:42:41.488 --> 01:42:45.959
STATEMENT HERE WE NEED TO

01:42:46.026 --> 01:42:47.094
PROTECT OUR CHILDREN.

01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:48.695
FROM WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE IN

01:42:48.762 --> 01:42:49.596
GOING FORWARD WITH THAT SENATOR

01:42:49.663 --> 01:42:50.330
WHITE HOUSE [inaudible]

01:42:50.397 --> 01:42:53.333
ON WE HAVE JUSTIFICATIONS FOR

01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:55.135
OPENING OF STATUES LIMITATIONS.

01:42:55.202 --> 01:42:57.070
THIS I'M COMMUTE.

01:42:57.137 --> 01:42:58.772
DIRECTLY -- EXPLAINED TO ME WE

01:42:58.839 --> 01:43:02.843
HAVE THE EMPLOYER WHO KNEW AND

01:43:02.910 --> 01:43:04.545
THAT'S SEEMS TO CLEAR

01:43:04.611 --> 01:43:05.913
JUSTIFICATION IN AND SHOULD HAVE

01:43:05.979 --> 01:43:08.582
KNOWN IN THE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

01:43:08.649 --> 01:43:11.652
LEGAL THEORY IS RATHER NEW TESTS

01:43:11.718 --> 01:43:12.619
THIRTY FORTY YEARS AGO I DON'T

01:43:12.686 --> 01:43:14.922
THINK AT LEAST WITH REGARD TO

01:43:14.988 --> 01:43:16.890
SEXUAL ASSAULT THIS IS NOT

01:43:16.957 --> 01:43:18.292
BATTERY DISS ASSAULT.

01:43:18.358 --> 01:43:21.628
THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT HOW.

01:43:21.695 --> 01:43:23.263
THERE HAS TO BE A WRONG FOR

01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:25.799
NEGLIGENT ACT AND SO OBVIOUSLY

01:43:25.866 --> 01:43:27.301
TIME MAKES THESE CLAIMS HARD BUT

01:43:27.367 --> 01:43:28.101
IT MAKES IT HARD ON THE

01:43:28.168 --> 01:43:29.036
PLAINTIFF HAS WELL I MEAN THE

01:43:29.102 --> 01:43:30.671
PLAINTIFF HAS TO THERE'S NO

01:43:30.737 --> 01:43:31.738
PRESUMPTION HERE.

01:43:31.805 --> 01:43:33.240
PLAINTIFF HAS TO SHOW THAT THERE

01:43:33.307 --> 01:43:35.776
WAS A NEGLIGENT OR WRONGFUL ACT --

01:43:35.842 --> 01:43:37.611
THAT THAT FORCE THE INSTITUTION

01:43:37.678 --> 01:43:40.247
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN -- THE CASES

01:43:40.314 --> 01:43:43.016
WE'VE SEEN -- IT'S IT'S PRETTY

01:43:43.083 --> 01:43:46.386
CLEAR IT'S FIVE GIRLS COMING IN

01:43:46.453 --> 01:43:47.821
ABOUT THE SAME GYM TEACHER THAT

01:43:47.888 --> 01:43:50.057
DID THE SAME -- INAPPROPRIATE

01:43:50.123 --> 01:43:52.025
ACTIONS TOWARDS THEM THAT THAT'S

01:43:52.092 --> 01:43:55.662
AS CLEAR AS IT CAN BE --

01:43:55.729 --> 01:43:57.230
OBVIOUSLY I IT RELIES ON

01:43:57.297 --> 01:43:58.599
EVIDENCE NOT EVIDENCE IF IT'S

01:43:58.665 --> 01:44:00.100
ESPECIALLY OLD IS GONNA BE HARD

01:44:00.167 --> 01:44:01.168
TO COME BY BUT IT'S THE

01:44:01.234 --> 01:44:03.370
PLAINTIFF WHO HAS TO PROVE THE

01:44:03.437 --> 01:44:04.638
CASE NOT THE DEFENDANT.

01:44:04.705 --> 01:44:05.939
ON MANTRA JUST I'M JUST SAYING

01:44:06.006 --> 01:44:07.841
THE STANDARD OF PROOF THIRTY

01:44:07.908 --> 01:44:09.343
YEARS AGO WASN'T THEY SHOULDN'T

01:44:09.409 --> 01:44:10.711
HAVE KNOWN I MEAN IT WAS IF YOU

01:44:10.777 --> 01:44:13.180
DO GET THE LIABILITY I I CAN SEE

01:44:13.246 --> 01:44:13.380
THAT.

01:44:13.447 --> 01:44:15.449
THE PROOF PROBLEMS BUT THIRTY

01:44:15.515 --> 01:44:17.184
FIVE YEARS AGO SHOULD HAVE KNOWN

01:44:17.250 --> 01:44:18.819
WAS NOT.

01:44:18.885 --> 01:44:20.821
ARE YOU WEREN'T LIABLE FOR YOU

01:44:20.887 --> 01:44:24.524
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN -- IF YOU WERE

01:44:24.591 --> 01:44:26.526
NEGLIGENT IS A THEORY.

01:44:26.593 --> 01:44:28.595
I'M IN THE SALT I MEAN BECAUSE

01:44:28.662 --> 01:44:29.229
AGAIN IT WAS JUST.

01:44:29.296 --> 01:44:30.631
IT MIGHT BE A DISTINCTION

01:44:30.697 --> 01:44:31.898
BETWEEN A BAD SEXUAL BATTERY AND

01:44:31.965 --> 01:44:32.933
THE SEXUAL ASSAULT.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.501
SO FOR THE EMPLOYERS IT'S ALWAYS

01:44:34.568 --> 01:44:36.737
BEEN.

01:44:36.803 --> 01:44:37.371
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN AS ALWAYS BEEN

01:44:37.437 --> 01:44:38.739
PART OF THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD

01:44:38.805 --> 01:44:40.273
SO THE FIRST TIME THAT THAN

01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:41.441
ANYTHING CHANGED AND THAT.

01:44:41.508 --> 01:44:45.212
WAS A AND SB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY

01:44:45.278 --> 01:44:46.279
NINE THE BILL BACK IN TWO

01:44:46.346 --> 01:44:47.681
THOUSAND THREE BUT GENERALLY

01:44:47.748 --> 01:44:47.981
[inaudible]

01:44:48.048 --> 01:44:49.650
ANY NEGLIGENCE.

01:44:49.716 --> 01:44:51.284
CAN BE KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN

01:44:51.351 --> 01:44:54.154
GOING BACK.

01:44:54.221 --> 01:44:55.555
I ASK BECAUSE IN THE BILL.

01:44:55.622 --> 01:44:56.556
THERE'S NO QUESTION PENDING

01:44:56.623 --> 01:44:58.291
THERE'S NO QUESTION PENDING A

01:44:58.358 --> 01:44:59.393
SENATOR WHAT CASKEY.

01:44:59.459 --> 01:45:01.962
THE REVIVAL THE THE STANDARD ONE

01:45:02.029 --> 01:45:03.597
YEAR REVIVAL VERSUS THE THREE

01:45:03.664 --> 01:45:06.566
YEAR REVIVAL -- I DON'T REMEMBER

01:45:06.633 --> 01:45:08.468
LAST YEAR'S BILL I'M I AN ACT

01:45:08.535 --> 01:45:09.269
THAT IF THEY HAD THE THREE YEAR

01:45:09.336 --> 01:45:10.370
REVIVAL I THOUGHT THEY DID OKAY

01:45:10.437 --> 01:45:11.805
SO THAT THE REGIONAL BELL HAD A

01:45:11.872 --> 01:45:13.306
ONE YEAR REVIVAL AND WHAT WE

01:45:13.373 --> 01:45:14.541
HAVE FOUND -- SINCE AND IS

01:45:14.608 --> 01:45:15.976
THERE'S A NUMBER OF REASONS WHY

01:45:16.043 --> 01:45:18.211
A IN A YEAR SOMEBODY EVEN WHO

01:45:18.278 --> 01:45:19.913
HAS COME TO TERMS WITH THE FACT

01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:21.948
THAT THIS HAPPENED -- IF YOU

01:45:22.015 --> 01:45:23.917
LOOK AT THE CLAIMS YOU'LL SEE --

01:45:23.984 --> 01:45:25.485
GIVE AN EXTRA IT IS SPECIFICALLY

01:45:25.552 --> 01:45:26.887
THE CLAIMS AGAINST THE CHURCH A

01:45:26.953 --> 01:45:29.456
LACK OF PLAINTIFFS WHO WERE A

01:45:29.523 --> 01:45:30.824
SPANISH SPEAKING THERE'S A

01:45:30.891 --> 01:45:32.159
REASON FOR THAT I MEAN THAT BY

01:45:32.225 --> 01:45:33.694
THE TIME IT ACTUALLY GETS TO

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:35.829
POTENTIAL PLAINTIFFS -- THE

01:45:35.896 --> 01:45:37.230
UNDERSTANDING COMING TO TERMS

01:45:37.297 --> 01:45:39.633
WITH THAT ONE YEAR WAS PRIOR TO

01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:41.468
ALL OF THE MEDIA ATTENTION

01:45:41.535 --> 01:45:42.369
THAT'S BEEN GIVEN TO THE

01:45:42.436 --> 01:45:43.804
SUBJECTS SENSE AS SPOTLIGHT AND

01:45:43.870 --> 01:45:45.472
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WITH THAT

01:45:45.539 --> 01:45:46.339
WE'VE SEEN WE WERE.

01:45:46.406 --> 01:45:48.175
WE LET IT SO QUICKLY -- THAT

01:45:48.241 --> 01:45:50.010
THAT ONE YEAR REALLY DIDN'T

01:45:50.077 --> 01:45:51.945
PROVIDE A A NUMBER OF THE

01:45:52.012 --> 01:45:54.314
VICTIMS TO COME FORWARD AND AND

01:45:54.381 --> 01:45:56.116
RECOGNIZE AND BE ABLE.

01:45:56.183 --> 01:45:58.585
TO ACCESS JUSTICE.

01:45:58.652 --> 01:46:00.053
MANAGER FACT BECAUSE THIS

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:00.554
REDUCES.

01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:01.922
TALK ABOUT WE SHOULD BE VERY

01:46:01.988 --> 01:46:03.623
STINGY IS LEGISLATORS ABOUT

01:46:03.690 --> 01:46:04.524
OPENING UP THE STATUE

01:46:04.591 --> 01:46:07.194
LIMITATIONS AND BE VERY NARROW

01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:09.196
SO WISTER EVIDENCE I MEAN I GET

01:46:09.262 --> 01:46:10.797
YOU AYE WHEN YOUR WINDOW IT'S

01:46:10.864 --> 01:46:15.902
WHEN YOU'RE WHEN THERE WAS FOR

01:46:15.969 --> 01:46:17.838
EVIDENCE THAT SAID.

01:46:17.904 --> 01:46:19.339
THE DO YOU FOUNDER HIT THE OTHER

01:46:19.406 --> 01:46:20.307
REPORTS HAVE SAID THAT.

01:46:20.373 --> 01:46:22.042
IT HAPPENS AT FOURTEEN MONTHS OR

01:46:22.109 --> 01:46:22.709
EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO I REALIZE WE

01:46:22.776 --> 01:46:23.977
GIVE EVERYBODY MORE TIME THERE'S

01:46:24.044 --> 01:46:25.212
MORE LAWSUITS THAT'S WELL IN WAR

01:46:25.278 --> 01:46:25.979
WE'RE WE'RE LEARNING EVERY DAY

01:46:26.046 --> 01:46:26.713
MORE ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF

01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:27.714
CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT AND THE

WORSE OF BY NOT SHOWING UP IN

MAKING THAT MATH CHOICE BETWEEN

THERE WAS A CLERICAL PERSON

02:11:56.041 --> 02:11:59.311
INVOLVED IN FORWARD IN AN EMAIL.

02:11:59.378 --> 02:12:01.947
IT THIS THIS SAME DOCTRINE EXIST

02:12:02.014 --> 02:12:03.348
IN THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

02:12:03.415 --> 02:12:05.584
WHERE DISCLOSURE TO CERTAIN

02:12:05.651 --> 02:12:07.052
OTHERS DON'T DON'T WAVE

02:12:07.119 --> 02:12:08.353
PRIVILEGE AND IT TRACKS WITH

02:12:08.420 --> 02:12:10.522
THAT LANGUAGE PARDON IT TRACKS

02:12:10.589 --> 02:12:12.157
WITH THAT LANGUAGE IS A TUNING

02:12:12.224 --> 02:12:14.159
IS IT.

02:12:14.226 --> 02:12:15.127
WHEN I READ IT GIVEN THAT?

02:12:15.193 --> 02:12:15.761
QUESTIONS WE HAVE LAST TIME IT

02:12:15.827 --> 02:12:17.429
LOOKED LIKE IT WAS A BREACH OF

02:12:17.496 --> 02:12:18.964
THE PRIVILEGE OR OR BREACH OF

02:12:19.031 --> 02:12:20.932
THE CONFIDENCE OF CONFIDENCE

02:12:20.999 --> 02:12:24.236
THAT NORMALLY WOULD.

02:12:24.303 --> 02:12:25.671
EVAPORATE THE PRIVILEGE SO IT

02:12:25.737 --> 02:12:26.705
HAS TO BE ANOTHER PERSON WITH

02:12:26.772 --> 02:12:28.273

WITH THAT -- QUESTION THAT I HAD

02:12:35.881 --> 02:12:37.883
ON THE DIS INTERESTED NESS

02:12:37.949 --> 02:12:39.551
BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER PRIVILEGES

02:12:39.618 --> 02:12:41.987
THAT WE HAPPEN AND WE HAVE A

02:12:42.054 --> 02:12:44.890
DISINTERESTED DOCTOR PATIENT AND

02:12:44.956 --> 02:12:48.260
ABUSE COUNSELOR THIS IS THIS.

JOINT PRIVILEGE IS HOW BY BY

02:12:50.962 --> 02:12:52.597
PEOPLE THAT WILL NOT HAVE A

DISINTEREST IN PRESERVE PERVERT.

02:12:55.133 --> 02:12:57.636
PRESERVING THE PRIVILEGE -- AND

02:12:57.703 --> 02:13:00.105
I'M WONDERING WHAT SAFEGUARDS WE

02:13:00.172 --> 02:13:01.640
HAVE FOR THAT THAT IT'S NOT

02:13:01.707 --> 02:13:03.942
GONNA BE MISUE.

02:13:04.009 --> 02:13:05.677
LET ME ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF WHY

02:13:05.744 --> 02:13:07.379
THEY'RE THE PRIVILEGES HELD BY

02:13:07.446 --> 02:13:10.749
BOTH THE UNION -- AND THE

02:13:10.816 --> 02:13:12.718
INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE.

02:13:12.784 --> 02:13:15.087

CLIENT AND THERE'S A PRIVILEGE

02:13:18.857 --> 02:13:20.192
AND THE CLIENT IS THE HOLDER OF

02:13:20.258 --> 02:13:21.593
THE PRIVILEGE.

02:13:21.660 --> 02:13:23.495
IN A UNION SITUATION IT IS VERY

02:13:23.562 --> 02:13:25.597
FREQUENT THAT UNIONS REPRESENT

02:13:25.664 --> 02:13:26.365
THE COLLECTIVE.

02:13:26.431 --> 02:13:29.167
THEY MAD THEY MAY INVESTIGATE.

02:13:29.234 --> 02:13:30.936
GRIEVANCES AND HAVE CONFIDENTIAL

02:13:31.002 --> 02:13:32.604
COMMUNICATIONS FROM MULTIPLE

02:13:32.671 --> 02:13:34.506
EMPLOYEES.

02:13:34.573 --> 02:13:38.276
BUT THE UNION MADE. TO THE

02:13:38.343 --> 02:13:40.212
GRIEVANCE OR BREACH OF CONTRACT

02:13:40.278 --> 02:13:41.747
LAWSUIT.

02:13:41.813 --> 02:13:44.249
A IN ITS OWN RIGHT.

02:13:44.316 --> 02:13:44.950
AND THAT'S WHY THEY WOULD THE

02:13:45.016 --> 02:13:46.918
THAT BOTH THE UNION AND THE

02:13:46.985 --> 02:13:48.453
INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE HAVE TO BE

02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:49.621
THE HOLDER.

02:13:49.688 --> 02:13:50.689
OF THE PRIVILEGE BECAUSE

02:13:50.756 --> 02:13:51.890
SOMETIMES.

02:13:51.957 --> 02:13:53.825
THE V. EMPLOYEE MAKING THE

02:13:53.892 --> 02:13:55.260
CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION ISN'T

02:13:55.327 --> 02:13:56.828
PART OF THE SUBSEQUENT LEGAL

02:13:56.895 --> 02:13:59.064
PROCEEDING.

02:13:59.131 --> 02:14:01.433
MADAM CHAIR BECAUSE NORMALLY WE

02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:03.201
WON ALL THAT INFORMATION TO GO

02:14:03.268 --> 02:14:04.903
BEFORE THE JUDGE IN BEFORE THE

02:14:04.970 --> 02:14:06.304
THE PERSON MAKING THAT DECISION

02:14:06.371 --> 02:14:08.640
YOU KNOW WE ARE STINGY ABOUT

02:14:08.707 --> 02:14:09.975
CARVING OUT.

02:14:10.041 --> 02:14:11.877
EVIDENCE THAT WE DON'T LET AND

02:14:11.943 --> 02:14:14.079
BECAUSE OF THE THE PARTICULAR

02:14:14.146 --> 02:14:16.081
NATURE OF IT SO I GUESS THE

02:14:16.148 --> 02:14:17.883
QUESTION I HAVE IS FOR THE UNION

02:14:17.949 --> 02:14:18.250
RAP.

02:14:18.316 --> 02:14:20.652
THEY COLLECT ALL THESE

02:14:20.719 --> 02:14:23.021
CONFIDENCES FROM VARIOUS PEOPLE

02:14:23.088 --> 02:14:25.757
THAT THE MEAN I HAVE ONE ONE ONE

02:14:25.824 --> 02:14:30.929
ONE ONE THEY COLLECT THEM -- I I

02:14:30.996 --> 02:14:33.031
GUESS HOW DO WE CONTROL THAT

02:14:33.098 --> 02:14:35.333
WHETHER THE CONDITIONS THAT YOU

02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:40.872
KNOW WE MONITOR IT OR OR POLICE

02:14:40.939 --> 02:14:41.506
IT.

02:14:41.573 --> 02:14:42.941
WILL BUT AGAIN IT GETS BACK TO

02:14:43.008 --> 02:14:45.143
THE DISTINCTION I MADE BEFORE

02:14:45.210 --> 02:14:46.912
ABOUT FAX.

02:14:46.978 --> 02:14:49.614
IN STRATEGY WHAT IS PRIVILEGED

02:14:49.681 --> 02:14:52.517
AS A STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION.

02:14:52.584 --> 02:14:54.986
BETWEEN THE UNION REPRESENTATIVE

02:14:55.053 --> 02:14:56.721
AND THE EMPLOYEE HOW TO PRESENT

02:14:56.788 --> 02:14:58.156
A CASE.

02:14:58.223 --> 02:15:00.725
WHAT THE FACTS ARE THE UNION HAS

02:15:00.792 --> 02:15:02.227
TO PASSED BRING FACTS FORWARD TO

02:15:02.294 --> 02:15:04.796
PROVE THE CASE AFTER THAT WHAT

02:15:04.863 --> 02:15:07.199
SHOULDN'T BE OPEN IS?

02:15:07.265 --> 02:15:09.267
IT IS THE ADVICE THE UNION

02:15:09.334 --> 02:15:11.803
REPRESENTATIVES ADVICE OR

02:15:11.870 --> 02:15:14.573
STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION TO THE

02:15:14.639 --> 02:15:15.340
EMPLOYEE.

02:15:15.407 --> 02:15:16.808
THAT IS THAT VERY ANALOGOUS TO

02:15:16.875 --> 02:15:17.809
THE ATTORNEY SO THAT MAKES ME

02:15:17.876 --> 02:15:19.244
FEEL BETTER I MEAN THE ADVICE IS

02:15:19.311 --> 02:15:22.013
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A STRATEGY

02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:23.248
VERSUS SOME.

02:15:23.315 --> 02:15:25.283

IT MAY BE. FOR A BUT OTHER

PUBLIC POLICY REASONS.

02:15:33.859 --> 02:15:36.595
DESIRABLE TO HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED

02:15:36.661 --> 02:15:37.762
TO THAT BECAUSE I SEE IT.

02:15:37.829 --> 02:15:40.031
AS A LAWYER WERE SORT OF LIMITED

02:15:40.098 --> 02:15:41.399
WHEN YOU DO DEFENSE WORK AND

02:15:41.466 --> 02:15:43.401
THINGS LIKE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND

02:15:43.468 --> 02:15:46.104
WHY YOU WHY YOU ARE NOT GOING TO

02:15:46.171 --> 02:15:47.739
DISCLOSE THAT THAT PERSON AS SHE

02:15:47.806 --> 02:15:49.107
TRIED TO CREATE A DEFENSE.

02:15:49.174 --> 02:15:51.109
THANK YOU AND THANK YOU OTHER

02:15:51.176 --> 02:15:53.245

OR CONCERNS IN THE LAST HEARING.

02:16:04.923 --> 02:16:06.858

02:16:06.925 --> 02:16:10.128
CHANGED IN IN YOUR OPINION.

02:16:10.195 --> 02:16:11.696
FROM -- THE PEACE LEGISLATION

SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENT THAT WAS

ADOPTED WAS TO TRY AND CLARIFY

02:16:28.647 --> 02:16:30.882

NOT CLEARLY DEFINED THERE SOME

02:16:42.193 --> 02:16:44.563
AMBIGUITY APART FROM THAT.

02:16:44.629 --> 02:16:45.630
AT ALL OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT

AMENDMENTS.

02:17:04.015 --> 02:17:04.783
OKAY -- I PROBABLY DON'T NEED TO

GO THROUGH SOME OF THE CONCERNS

02:17:05.483 --> 02:17:06.451
THAT WERE RAISED -- BEFORE OTHER

02:17:06.518 --> 02:17:08.086
THAN.

02:17:08.153 --> 02:17:11.289
AT A CURSORY LEVEL I THINK.

02:17:11.356 --> 02:17:13.525
PRIVILEGE IN OUR IN OUR LEGAL

02:17:13.592 --> 02:17:15.527
SYSTEM IS NOR IS NORMALLY BEEN

02:17:15.594 --> 02:17:17.495
AFFORDED TO VERY SPECIAL

02:17:17.562 --> 02:17:18.530
RELATIONSHIPS.

02:17:18.597 --> 02:17:20.332
AND THOSE GO ABOUT WITH

02:17:20.398 --> 02:17:22.400
CERTIFICATION OF OUR TRAINING

02:17:22.467 --> 02:17:24.536
CONTINUING LEE -- EDUCATION

WHETHER IT'S MEDICAL OR OR OR

02:17:26.037 --> 02:17:27.372
LEGAL.

02:17:27.439 --> 02:17:28.940
AND SO I'VE ALWAYS BEEN OLDER

02:17:29.007 --> 02:17:31.543
RELUCTANT TO EXPAND UPON THAT

02:17:31.610 --> 02:17:33.645
TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP.

02:17:33.712 --> 02:17:36.648
ABSENT -- TRULY COMPELLING NEEDS.

02:17:36.715 --> 02:17:38.783
AND I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WANT TO

02:17:38.850 --> 02:17:41.186
CREATE A BROADER.

02:17:41.252 --> 02:17:42.954
A SET OF PROTECTIONS IN

02:17:43.021 --> 02:17:44.155
PRIVILEGES.

02:17:44.222 --> 02:17:45.457
THAT GO BEYOND WHAT ALREADY

02:17:45.523 --> 02:17:46.725
EXISTS BETWEEN A LAWYER AND

02:17:46.791 --> 02:17:48.393
CLIENT AND THE DOCTOR AND

02:17:48.460 --> 02:17:52.263
PATIENT PRIEST PENITENT -- I'M

02:17:52.330 --> 02:17:53.198
JUST TRYING TO I DON'T THINK

02:17:53.264 --> 02:17:54.866
I'VE COME TO TERMS WITH THE IDEA

02:17:54.933 --> 02:17:56.601
THAT THERE IS SUCH A COMPELLING

02:17:56.668 --> 02:17:57.569
NEED.

02:17:57.636 --> 02:17:59.738
THAT PRIVILEGE SHOULD EXIST ON

02:17:59.804 --> 02:18:01.506
THE SITUATION.

02:18:01.573 --> 02:18:02.874
AND THAT SHOULD BE HELD.

02:18:02.941 --> 02:18:06.911
ON BY BOTH SETS OF PARTIES --

02:18:06.978 --> 02:18:08.346
AND WE'VE HEARD THE EXAMPLE OF

02:18:08.413 --> 02:18:10.815
THE LEGAL BUT ALSO ON TOP OF THE

02:18:10.882 --> 02:18:13.518
COULD THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST I

02:18:13.585 --> 02:18:15.153
THINK THE SATISFYING

02:18:15.220 --> 02:18:15.453
[inaudible]

02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:18.923
MULTIPLE INTERESTS.

02:18:18.990 --> 02:18:20.291
IS.

02:18:20.358 --> 02:18:21.693
COULD VERY WELL CREATE A CONE.

02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:23.828
OF INFORMATION.

02:18:23.895 --> 02:18:25.363
SO INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY HELPING

02:18:25.430 --> 02:18:26.865
THE INDIVIDUALS.

02:18:26.931 --> 02:18:28.700
IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY OR

02:18:28.767 --> 02:18:30.568
THE COLLECTIVE AS A WHOLE I

02:18:30.635 --> 02:18:32.871
THINK IT IS PRONE TO CREATE A

02:18:32.937 --> 02:18:34.239
SILO.

02:18:34.305 --> 02:18:36.074
OF INFORMATION.

02:18:36.141 --> 02:18:37.809
AND THE CIRCULATION OF WHICH

02:18:37.876 --> 02:18:39.878
ROOM AND THE PROSPECT OF THAT

02:18:39.944 --> 02:18:41.746
REMAINS UNKNOWN AND FRANKLY

02:18:41.813 --> 02:18:42.714
THING DANGEROUS.

02:18:42.781 --> 02:18:45.950
WE'RE INFORMATION CAN BE HELD

02:18:46.017 --> 02:18:48.887
WITHIN A CONFINED ENVIRONMENT --

02:18:48.953 --> 02:18:52.057
IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE -- I

02:18:52.123 --> 02:18:53.558
THINK THE LAST TIME THERE WAS A

02:18:53.625 --> 02:18:55.293
THERE WAS CONCERN AND HAVE A

02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:58.263
GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT -- FOR ALL

02:18:58.329 --> 02:18:59.130
YOUR EFFORTS I THINK

02:18:59.197 --> 02:19:00.465
PHILOSOPHICALLY WERE LOOKING AT

02:19:00.532 --> 02:19:02.367
DIFFERENT THINGS AND I FULLY

02:19:02.434 --> 02:19:03.835
APPRECIATE THAT.

02:19:03.902 --> 02:19:06.237
BUT I CERTAINLY WOULD -- NOT ONE

02:19:06.304 --> 02:19:11.242
A LOOK BACK AND AT THE THE

02:19:11.309 --> 02:19:11.810
TWENTY NINETEEN LEGISLATIVE

02:19:11.876 --> 02:19:14.412
CYCLE AND I THINK THAT WE

02:19:14.479 --> 02:19:16.281
CREATED A NEW BRAND OF PRIVILEGE

02:19:16.347 --> 02:19:18.917
BECAUSE IT'S ONLY A MATTER TIME.

02:19:18.983 --> 02:19:20.552
BEFORE THERE'S A MANAGEMENT IN

02:19:20.618 --> 02:19:22.987
EMPLOYEE REQUEST FOR PRIVILEGE.

02:19:23.054 --> 02:19:25.190
BETWEEN YOU KNOW UNCERTIFIED

02:19:25.256 --> 02:19:27.392
COUNSELORS IN THOSE WHO RECEIVE

02:19:27.459 --> 02:19:30.128
COUNSELING PRIVILEGE I MEAN THIS

02:19:30.195 --> 02:19:32.464
IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE THAT I DON'T

02:19:32.530 --> 02:19:34.265
THINK THAT WE SHOULD -- EMBARK

02:19:34.332 --> 02:19:36.735
UPON BECAUSE THEY WILL COME UP

02:19:36.801 --> 02:19:38.303
WITH COMPELLING REASONS NOT

02:19:38.369 --> 02:19:39.504
UNLIKE THE ONES THAT YOU'VE COME

02:19:39.571 --> 02:19:42.440
UP WITH -- IN THE COURSE OF OF

02:19:42.507 --> 02:19:46.311
THE DISCUSSION HERE -- I'M SORRY

02:19:46.377 --> 02:19:47.679
JUST WON'T BE IN A POSITION TO

02:19:47.746 --> 02:19:49.748
TO SUPPORT THIS AND I THINK IT

02:19:49.814 --> 02:19:52.183
IT WILL END UP BEING SOMETHING

02:19:52.250 --> 02:19:52.851
THAT WE REGRET.

02:19:52.917 --> 02:19:54.486
DOWN THE ROAD COURSE WE ALWAYS

02:19:54.552 --> 02:19:55.887
HAVE THE ABILITY HERE WE CALL A

02:19:55.954 --> 02:19:57.889
POLITELY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

02:19:57.956 --> 02:19:59.324
AND IF THERE ARE ANY I'M SURE

02:19:59.390 --> 02:20:01.159
THAT THERE WILL BE FOLLOW UP

02:20:01.226 --> 02:20:02.160
LEGISLATION.

02:20:02.227 --> 02:20:03.928
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS

02:20:03.995 --> 02:20:06.331
SENATOR TO RUSSELL.

02:20:06.397 --> 02:20:07.732
AND THEN FALL BY SENATOR UMBERG

02:20:07.799 --> 02:20:08.032
[inaudible]

02:20:08.099 --> 02:20:11.269
YES -- HAVING SPENT A LOT OF

02:20:11.336 --> 02:20:12.704
TIME IN MY LIFE AROUND.

02:20:12.771 --> 02:20:14.405
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IN WORK

02:20:14.472 --> 02:20:16.775
PLACES THAT HAVE COLLECTIVE

02:20:16.841 --> 02:20:19.511
BARGAINING -- IT JUST SEEMS LIKE

02:20:19.577 --> 02:20:21.880
A NO BRAINER TO ME.

02:20:21.946 --> 02:20:22.814
ON THE PRACTICAL SIDE HERE YOU

02:20:22.881 --> 02:20:24.549
HAVE.

02:20:24.616 --> 02:20:26.184
EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE A

02:20:26.251 --> 02:20:29.154
REPRESENTATIVE THAT THEY GO TO

02:20:29.220 --> 02:20:30.522
FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. TO

02:20:30.588 --> 02:20:32.490
NEGOTIATE THEIR AGREEMENT THEIR

02:20:32.557 --> 02:20:34.492
WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS AND

02:20:34.559 --> 02:20:36.194
ALL THAT BUT ALSO TO GO TO THE

02:20:36.261 --> 02:20:37.829
UNION TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT

02:20:37.896 --> 02:20:38.863
SOLUTIONS.

02:20:38.930 --> 02:20:40.865
AND TRY TO SOLVE ISSUES THAT

02:20:40.932 --> 02:20:42.133
COME UP.

02:20:42.200 --> 02:20:43.368
SOMETIMES OF THE EMPLOYER

02:20:43.434 --> 02:20:44.736
SOMETIMES WITH OTHER WITH CALM

02:20:44.803 --> 02:20:46.104
PLACE.

02:20:46.171 --> 02:20:50.341
IT'S A VERY PRACTICAL SIDE OF OF

02:20:50.408 --> 02:20:52.443
LIFE IN THE WORKPLACE TO BE ABLE

02:20:52.510 --> 02:20:55.346
TO SAY YEAH WHATEVER YOU SAY TO

02:20:55.413 --> 02:20:56.247
ME.

02:20:56.314 --> 02:20:58.449
DON'T WORRY IT'S NOT GONNA BE.

02:20:58.516 --> 02:21:00.685
FED OUTSIDE OF THIS ROOM IS

02:21:00.752 --> 02:21:02.353
REALLY IMPORTANT. TO THAT

02:21:02.420 --> 02:21:04.522
WORKPLACE AND TO KNOW THAT YOU

02:21:04.589 --> 02:21:07.325
CAN TALK TO SOMEONE TALK TO YOU

02:21:07.392 --> 02:21:08.593
UNION.

02:21:08.660 --> 02:21:10.495
AGENT AND BE ABLE -- TO HAVE

02:21:10.562 --> 02:21:13.131
THAT PROTECTION OF WHAT YOU SAY

02:21:13.198 --> 02:21:14.933
AND THERE'S A RESPONSIBILITY FOR

02:21:14.999 --> 02:21:16.000
THE WHOLE WORKPLACE.

02:21:16.067 --> 02:21:17.068
THERE'S IT IS SPECIAL

02:21:17.135 --> 02:21:19.103
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EMPLOYER

02:21:19.170 --> 02:21:21.873
WITH MANAGERS WITH SUPERVISORS

02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:23.675
WITH OTHER EMPLOYEES THERE'S ALL

02:21:23.741 --> 02:21:25.977
SORTS OF THINGS AT STAKE HERE.

02:21:26.044 --> 02:21:28.513
AND SO I THINK THERE'S A REALLY

02:21:28.580 --> 02:21:30.949
PRACTICAL FIED.

02:21:31.015 --> 02:21:32.083
THAT NEEDS TO BE.

02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:34.719
UNDERSTOOD AS FAR AS WHY WOULD

02:21:34.786 --> 02:21:37.021
YOU WANT TO PROTECT THOSE KINDS

02:21:37.088 --> 02:21:38.957
OF CONVERSATIONS SO.

02:21:39.023 --> 02:21:41.492
IT MAY BE TOO MUCH TO TRY TO GET

02:21:41.559 --> 02:21:43.661
BUT IT IS VERY SIMPLE YOU GO TO

02:21:43.728 --> 02:21:45.263
SOMEONE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO

02:21:45.330 --> 02:21:46.364
CONFIDE IN THEM.

02:21:46.431 --> 02:21:48.500
ABOUT WHATEVER IS GOING ON IN

02:21:48.566 --> 02:21:50.401
THE WORKPLACE YOU EXPECT THERE

02:21:50.468 --> 02:21:52.871
TO BE CONFIDENTIALITY THANK YOU

02:21:52.937 --> 02:21:56.474
THANK YOU SENATOR UMBERG -- I I

02:21:56.541 --> 02:21:58.476
THINK THIS IS A RATHER PROFOUND

02:21:58.543 --> 02:22:00.011
CHANGE IN THE LAW THAT TYPICALLY

02:22:00.078 --> 02:22:02.447
WHEN WE ACCORDING TO FORD --

02:22:02.513 --> 02:22:04.782
SPECIAL STATUS OF PRIVILEGE

02:22:04.849 --> 02:22:05.917
USUALLY DOES COME WITH OTHER

02:22:05.984 --> 02:22:07.552
QUALIFICATIONS WHETHER IT'S

02:22:07.619 --> 02:22:09.187
SPECIAL TRAINING OR WHETHER

02:22:09.254 --> 02:22:10.121
SPECIAL STATUS WHATEVER IT MAY

02:22:10.188 --> 02:22:10.788
BE.

02:22:10.855 --> 02:22:12.123
AND THIS IS EVEN MORE UNUSUAL

02:22:12.190 --> 02:22:13.324
BECAUSE THE PRIVILEGE IS GOING

02:22:13.391 --> 02:22:14.325
TO BE HELD BY BOTH THE

02:22:14.392 --> 02:22:16.261
ORGANIZATION AS WELL AS BY THE

02:22:16.327 --> 02:22:17.161
INDIVIDUAL.

02:22:17.228 --> 02:22:18.930
AND EVEN MORE UNIQUE BECAUSE THE

02:22:18.997 --> 02:22:20.231
PERSON WHO RECEIVES THAT

02:22:20.298 --> 02:22:21.799
CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION I

02:22:21.866 --> 02:22:23.601
THINK IS AN OBLIGATION NOT JUST

02:22:23.668 --> 02:22:24.869
TO THE INDIVIDUAL.

02:22:24.936 --> 02:22:27.138
WHO'S COMMUNICATING BUT ALSO TO

02:22:27.205 --> 02:22:28.473
OTHERS IN THE ORGANIZATION AND I

02:22:28.539 --> 02:22:31.609
RAISE THIS BEFORE WITH RESPECT

02:22:31.676 --> 02:22:32.577
TO HARM TO OTHER CO WORKERS.

02:22:32.644 --> 02:22:34.646
IN SOME PLACES SO FOR EXAMPLE IF

02:22:34.712 --> 02:22:35.747
YOU LOOK AT UNIVERSITY

02:22:35.813 --> 02:22:37.348
CALIFORNIA VERSUS SUPERIOR COURT

02:22:37.415 --> 02:22:38.917
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA HAD A

02:22:38.983 --> 02:22:39.951
SPECIAL.

02:22:40.018 --> 02:22:41.719
RESPONSIBILITY CONCERNING HEALTH

02:22:41.786 --> 02:22:44.422
AND WELFARE OF OTHER STUDENTS

02:22:44.489 --> 02:22:45.590
THE SAME THING WITH RESPECT TO

02:22:45.657 --> 02:22:48.026
PSYCHIATRISTS MAYBE PSYCHOLOGIST

02:22:48.092 --> 02:22:49.527
BUT CERTAINLY PSYCHIATRISTS WHO

02:22:49.594 --> 02:22:51.429
HAVE A DUTY TO WARN I TALKED

02:22:51.496 --> 02:22:52.797
LAST TIME ABOUT PERHAPS.

02:22:52.864 --> 02:22:54.532
SOME SORT OF A DUTY I UNDERSTAND

02:22:54.599 --> 02:22:57.468
WHY -- IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO

02:22:57.535 --> 02:22:58.903
MAKE SURE THAT COMMUNICATIONS

02:22:58.970 --> 02:23:00.204
AND REGARDING REGARDING

02:23:00.271 --> 02:23:02.307
NEGOTIATION THOSE KINDS OF

02:23:02.373 --> 02:23:04.008
INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS BE KEPT

02:23:04.075 --> 02:23:06.044
CONFIDENTIAL AND NOT ALLOW THE

02:23:06.110 --> 02:23:07.545
OTHER SIDE BASICALLY GAIN ACCESS.

02:23:07.612 --> 02:23:10.648
BUT BUT AS I EXPRESSED CONCERN.

02:23:10.715 --> 02:23:13.718
OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS ABOUT.

02:23:13.785 --> 02:23:15.386
COMMUNICATIONS THAT REFLECT

02:23:15.453 --> 02:23:18.122
SOMEONE'S INTEREST IN PERHAPS

02:23:18.189 --> 02:23:20.325
DOING HARM TO ANOTHER COWORKER

02:23:20.391 --> 02:23:21.926
THAT IS A CONCERN OF MINE IN

02:23:21.993 --> 02:23:22.560
THAT THAT PARTICULAR IN THIS

02:23:22.627 --> 02:23:23.227
CONTEXT.

02:23:23.294 --> 02:23:24.495
AND IT'S NOT UNUSUAL

02:23:24.562 --> 02:23:26.431
CIRCUMSTANCE IT I MEAN IT DOES

02:23:26.497 --> 02:23:28.032
HAPPEN THE CO WORKERS BOTH

02:23:28.099 --> 02:23:30.268
HARASS AND AND COMMIT WRONGFUL

02:23:30.335 --> 02:23:32.603
ACCESS TO OTHER COWORKERS.

02:23:32.670 --> 02:23:33.604
AND SO ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS

02:23:33.671 --> 02:23:36.074
THAT I PROPOSED -- A COUPLE DAYS

READS THERE IS NO PRIVILEGE

02:23:49.620 --> 02:23:52.023
UNDER THIS ARTICLE IF THE UNION

02:23:52.090 --> 02:23:53.558
AGENT REASON WE BELIEVE THAT.

02:23:53.625 --> 02:23:55.026
DISCLOSURE OF ANY CONFIDENTIAL

02:23:55.093 --> 02:23:57.128
COMMUNICATION IS NECESSARY TO

02:23:57.195 --> 02:23:59.831
PREVENT A CRIMINAL ACT PERIOD IN

02:23:59.897 --> 02:24:01.032

PERHAPS YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT

02:24:11.809 --> 02:24:13.144

THE QUESTIONS ON RUBBER THAT

02:25:14.005 --> 02:25:15.039
ABSOLUTELY WE'RE OPEN TO

02:25:15.106 --> 02:25:15.873
CONTINUE THE CONVERSATIONS ON

02:25:15.940 --> 02:25:19.110

CONVERSATION SPECIFIC TO THAT

02:25:26.551 --> 02:25:29.020
REQUEST -- BUT I THINK IT'S A

02:25:29.087 --> 02:25:34.192
DEFICIT THAT WE CAN WORK ON TO

02:25:34.258 --> 02:25:38.162
BUT TO RESOLVE THAT ISSUE -- AND

02:25:38.229 --> 02:25:39.430
YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT THE

02:25:39.497 --> 02:25:40.198
THERE DEFINITELY IS.

02:25:40.264 --> 02:25:41.799
THE BOTTOM LINE IS IS DO WE

02:25:41.866 --> 02:25:43.234
BELIEVE THERE'S A ESPECIALLY

02:25:43.301 --> 02:25:44.936
GIVEN THE CURRENT -- CONDITIONS

02:25:45.770 --> 02:25:48.139
TIME -- IN TERMS OF THE WILLING

02:25:48.206 --> 02:25:50.475
AWAY OF WHAT WORKERS RIGHTS AND

02:25:50.541 --> 02:25:51.242
THE ABILITY.

02:25:51.309 --> 02:25:53.010
OF WORKERS TO BE PROPERLY

02:25:53.077 --> 02:25:54.946
REPRESENTED -- IS THERE AN

02:25:55.012 --> 02:25:56.714
OVERRIDING SOCIAL INTEREST TO

02:25:56.781 --> 02:25:58.282
LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD -- IN

02:25:58.349 --> 02:26:00.485
THIS PARTICULAR CASE -- IN TO

02:26:00.551 --> 02:26:02.153
ENSURE THAT FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I

02:26:02.220 --> 02:26:02.987
WAS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS SAN

OVER PERSONAL MATTERS OR UNION

02:26:09.093 --> 02:26:09.594
MATTERS ARE VOTING WHATEVER

02:26:09.660 --> 02:26:10.761

02:26:10.828 --> 02:26:11.696
AND WE HAD OUR CITY ATTORNEY

02:26:11.762 --> 02:26:13.131
REPORT TO US AND I WAS ALL IN

02:26:13.197 --> 02:26:16.367
CONFIDENCE -- AND THAT'S THAT'S

02:26:16.434 --> 02:26:17.602
A GREAT POINT THAT WE HAVE TO

02:26:17.668 --> 02:26:19.203
RECOGNIZE THAT THESE WORKERS

02:26:19.270 --> 02:26:21.172
DON'T HAVE EASY AND QUICK ACCESS

02:26:21.239 --> 02:26:21.973
TO A LAWYER BUT THEY DO HAVE

02:26:22.039 --> 02:26:23.841
ACCESS. TO THEIR UNION

02:26:23.908 --> 02:26:25.243
REPRESENTATIVE AND THAT

02:26:25.309 --> 02:26:28.045
COMMUNICATION IS ONE THAT -- WE

02:26:28.112 --> 02:26:29.413
CAN HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION

02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:30.515
AS TO WHETHER IT'S A SPECIAL ONE

02:26:30.581 --> 02:26:31.916
THAT SHOULD BE PROTECTED I

02:26:31.983 --> 02:26:34.318
CERTAINLY BELIEVE THAT IT IS ONE

02:26:34.385 --> 02:26:36.621
THAT SHOULD BE PROTECTED -- AND

02:26:36.687 --> 02:26:38.222
I THINK UNIONS ARE ACCUSTOMED

02:26:38.289 --> 02:26:39.490
REPRESENTING MANY MANY PEOPLE

02:26:39.557 --> 02:26:41.492

02:26:41.559 --> 02:26:43.227
HOW TO RESOLVE THAT -- BUT AS IT

02:26:43.294 --> 02:26:45.563
APPLIES TO A PROTECTING A

02:26:45.630 --> 02:26:47.965
COMMUNICATIONS IN CIVIL ACTIONS

02:26:48.032 --> 02:26:48.599
I THINK THAT IT'S A COMPLETELY

02:26:48.666 --> 02:26:49.800
DIFFERENT ISSUE.

02:26:49.867 --> 02:26:50.701

BE SOME PHILOSOPHICAL

02:26:54.772 --> 02:26:56.374

02:31:50.568 --> 02:31:51.969
BENEFIT EVEN TO THOSE WHO DON'T

ANALYSIS OF THE BILL.

02:32:35.646 --> 02:32:37.815
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE NEWSPAPERS

02:32:37.882 --> 02:32:39.783
WOULD BE IN SUPPORT BECAUSE IT

02:32:39.850 --> 02:32:41.318

02:32:54.098 --> 02:32:56.066
AS WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS AND

02:32:56.133 --> 02:32:58.302
STAFF HAS ANALYZED IT -- I THINK

02:32:58.369 --> 02:32:59.737
THEY'RE JUST TOO MANY UNANSWERED

02:32:59.803 --> 02:33:01.038
QUESTIONS IN UNINTENDED

02:33:01.105 --> 02:33:04.008
CONSEQUENCES WHICH I'D LIKE TO

02:33:04.074 --> 02:33:06.143
ARTICULATE -- BECAUSE WE HAVE

02:33:06.210 --> 02:33:07.745
GIVEN THIS A VERY SERIOUS LOOK

02:33:07.811 --> 02:33:10.481
AND WE UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE

02:33:10.548 --> 02:33:12.449
THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AND I BY

02:33:12.516 --> 02:33:13.951
NO SPEAKING FOR MYSELF FROM

02:33:14.018 --> 02:33:15.953
PROBABLY FOR EVERYONE HERE IS

02:33:16.020 --> 02:33:17.521
MANY OF US LAWYERS AND ALL.

02:33:17.588 --> 02:33:19.089
WE SUPPORT THE PUBLIC RECORDS

02:33:19.156 --> 02:33:20.824
ACT WE DO NEED TO HAVE THAT

02:33:20.891 --> 02:33:21.325
SUNSHINE.

02:33:21.392 --> 02:33:23.494
BUT THIS BILL DRASTICALLY

02:33:23.561 --> 02:33:25.863
CHANGES HOW THE C. P. R. A. IS

02:33:25.930 --> 02:33:27.565
ENFORCED BY HAVING ONE

02:33:27.631 --> 02:33:28.933
INDIVIDUAL.

02:33:28.999 --> 02:33:30.668
MAKE THE DETERMINATION OF A

02:33:30.734 --> 02:33:32.803
RECORD IS DISCLOSED DOUBLE UNDER

02:33:32.870 --> 02:33:34.505
THE C. P. R. A. INSTEAD OF THE

02:33:34.572 --> 02:33:36.073
COURTS.

02:33:36.140 --> 02:33:37.474
WE'RE MOVING THE AUTHORITY THE

02:33:37.541 --> 02:33:38.776
JURISDICTION AWAY FROM THE

02:33:38.842 --> 02:33:41.512
COURTS THERE IS NO WAY. FOR A

02:33:41.579 --> 02:33:43.113
STATE AGENCY TO APPEAL THE

02:33:43.180 --> 02:33:45.249
DECISION OF THE ON BUDGET PERSON.

02:33:45.316 --> 02:33:46.884
UNDER EXISTING LAW THE STATE

02:33:46.951 --> 02:33:48.786
AGENCY CAN APPEAL A SUPERIOR

02:33:48.852 --> 02:33:51.522
COURT DECISION REGARDING THE CPR

02:33:51.589 --> 02:33:53.457
A THERE IS NO WAY A PERSON WHOSE

02:33:53.524 --> 02:33:55.526
INFORMATION IS IMPLICATED BY THE

02:33:55.593 --> 02:33:58.095
RECORDS. TO BE ABLE TO INTERVENE

02:33:58.162 --> 02:33:59.563
TO ADVOCATE FOR THEIR PRIVACY

02:33:59.630 --> 02:34:00.798
RIGHTS.

02:34:00.864 --> 02:34:03.167
THE CONSEQUENCES HERE ARE GRAVE

02:34:03.233 --> 02:34:05.369
ONCE PRIVATE INFORMATION IS

02:34:05.436 --> 02:34:07.204
DISCLOSED TO THE PUBLIC IT

02:34:07.271 --> 02:34:08.505
CANNOT BE TAKEN BACK.

02:34:08.572 --> 02:34:10.774
IT CREATES A TWO TIER SYSTEM OF

02:34:10.841 --> 02:34:13.110
ENFORCING RIGHTS UNDER THE CPR A

02:34:13.177 --> 02:34:15.546
IT APPLIES EQUALLY TO STATE

02:34:15.613 --> 02:34:18.749
AGENCIES -- THE SIXERS WITH THE

02:34:18.816 --> 02:34:20.184
C. P. R. A APPLIES EQUALLY TO

02:34:20.250 --> 02:34:21.719
STATE AGENCIES AND LOCAL

02:34:21.785 --> 02:34:23.387
AGENCIES BUT THE BILL ONLY

02:34:23.454 --> 02:34:27.324
APPLIES TO STATE AGENCIES -- I

02:34:27.391 --> 02:34:29.927
WILL GO ON BECAUSE OR I CAN GO

02:34:29.994 --> 02:34:31.729
ON I GUESS I SHOULD SAY BUT

02:34:31.795 --> 02:34:33.931
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS

02:34:33.998 --> 02:34:36.333
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS -- LACK OF

02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:39.970
ABILITY FOR BOTH SIDES TO APPEAL --

02:34:40.037 --> 02:34:44.008
STATE AGENCIES OR IT APPLIES TO

02:34:44.074 --> 02:34:44.208
THEM.

02:34:44.274 --> 02:34:45.009
THE EXISTING LAW MAKES

02:34:45.075 --> 02:34:46.610
DETERMINATIONS EXCLUSIVELY A

02:34:46.677 --> 02:34:48.112
JUDICIAL FUNCTION.

02:34:48.178 --> 02:34:49.980
WITH THE COURTS HAVE TO BALANCE

02:34:50.047 --> 02:34:51.982
TO FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL

02:34:52.049 --> 02:34:54.485
RIGHT THE RIGHT OF PRIVACY AND

02:34:54.551 --> 02:34:55.853
THE RIGHT OF PUBLIC ACCESS

02:34:55.919 --> 02:34:57.721
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE SYSTEM

02:34:57.788 --> 02:34:58.989
SET UP IS IT HOUSE.

02:34:59.056 --> 02:35:00.524
THE OMBUDSMAN PERSON IS NOT

02:35:00.591 --> 02:35:01.725
REQUIRED TO HAVE ANY JUDICIAL

02:35:01.792 --> 02:35:03.661
EXPERIENCE OR EVEN BE A LICENSED

02:35:03.727 --> 02:35:05.329
ATTORNEY.

02:35:05.396 --> 02:35:07.431
SO IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT THE BILL IS

02:35:07.498 --> 02:35:08.465
DOING IS THIS A NEW

02:35:08.532 --> 02:35:11.135
ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY OR NOT.

02:35:11.201 --> 02:35:12.903
IS THE OMBUDSMAN'S -- BOARDS

02:35:12.970 --> 02:35:14.738
PERSONS WE GOT TO FIND A BETTER

02:35:14.805 --> 02:35:16.173
NAME FOR THIS BUT ANYWAY IS

02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:18.542
THERE ARE ISSUING AN ADVISORY

02:35:18.609 --> 02:35:21.178
OPINION BINDING DECISIONS --

02:35:21.245 --> 02:35:23.047
THAT HAVE TO BE FOLLOWED WOULD

02:35:23.113 --> 02:35:26.383
RULES OF EVIDENCE APPLY -- WE'RE

02:35:26.450 --> 02:35:31.655
GIVING AUTHORITY HERE -- TO THE

02:35:31.722 --> 02:35:32.923
STATE AUDITOR.

02:35:32.990 --> 02:35:36.527
ARE TO BE THE ONE TO GONNA PLACE

02:35:36.593 --> 02:35:38.162
THE AGENCY THERE THE STATE

02:35:38.228 --> 02:35:39.963
AUDITOR'S SUBJECT TO THE C. P.

02:35:40.030 --> 02:35:41.665
R. A. SO THERE'S POTENTIAL THAT

02:35:41.732 --> 02:35:43.467
THE ON BLITZ PERSON WOULD HAVE

02:35:43.534 --> 02:35:45.002
TO REVIEW A DECISION BY THE

02:35:45.069 --> 02:35:46.770
STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE TO DENY

02:35:46.837 --> 02:35:48.772
DISCLOSURE OF A PUBLIC RECORD.

02:35:48.839 --> 02:35:50.074
LEADING TO A CONFLICT OF

02:35:50.140 --> 02:35:52.443
INTEREST THE THE THE CONCERNS GO

02:35:52.509 --> 02:35:54.144
ON AND ON WE WE'VE DISCUSSED

02:35:54.211 --> 02:35:56.480
THEM I APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE

02:35:56.547 --> 02:35:59.083
LOOKING FOR A BETTER METHOD -- I

02:35:59.149 --> 02:36:00.517
WOULD SUGGEST THAT WITH ALL

02:36:00.584 --> 02:36:03.087
THOSE QUESTIONS THAT THIS BILL.

02:36:03.153 --> 02:36:05.656
IS NOT RIGHT FOR PRIME TIME IT

02:36:05.723 --> 02:36:07.758
HAS I THINK TOO MANY --

02:36:07.825 --> 02:36:09.860
SIGNIFICANT ARE QUESTIONS

02:36:09.927 --> 02:36:11.695
ASSOCIATED BOTH WITH THE PUBLIC

02:36:11.762 --> 02:36:14.264
AND PRIVACY RIGHTS AS WELL AS

02:36:14.331 --> 02:36:16.734
THAT BALANCING OF PUBLIC ACCESS

02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:20.370
SO -- AGAIN I I I WOULD I WOULD

02:36:20.437 --> 02:36:21.171
SAY WOULD LEAVE IT AT THAT I

02:36:21.238 --> 02:36:22.372
WENT ON A LITTLE LONGER THAN I

02:36:22.439 --> 02:36:24.842
EXPECTED BUT THERE ARE.

02:36:24.908 --> 02:36:27.311
MANY MANY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS

02:36:27.377 --> 02:36:29.246
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS MEASURE --

02:36:29.313 --> 02:36:31.148
I WOULD ASK AND IT YOU KNOW YOU

THAT'S FINE -- I WOULD BE HAPPY

02:36:35.486 --> 02:36:37.187
TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS -- GOING

02:36:37.254 --> 02:36:39.523
FORWARD SO THAT WE COULD PERHAPS

02:36:39.590 --> 02:36:40.290
ADDRESS.

02:36:40.357 --> 02:36:41.425
SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS BUT

02:36:41.492 --> 02:36:43.160
BASICALLY TAKING THOSE FROM THE

02:36:43.227 --> 02:36:45.829
JUDICIARY AND PUTTING IT IN THE

02:36:45.896 --> 02:36:47.030
HANDS OF ONE PERSON.

02:36:47.097 --> 02:36:48.999
CREATE SOME VERY VERY SERIOUS

02:36:49.066 --> 02:36:51.101

CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC.

02:37:07.918 --> 02:37:09.853
THAT THE THAT ACCESS TO

02:37:09.920 --> 02:37:11.688
INFORMATION IS KEY.

02:37:18.262 --> 02:37:20.164
EQUIVALENTS.

02:37:20.230 --> 02:37:23.700
IT IS ABSOLUTELY IN IMPERATIVE.

02:37:23.767 --> 02:37:26.270
THAT WE DON'T OUR RELY ON A

02:37:26.336 --> 02:37:28.872

OUR THAT FORCE INDIVIDUALS INTO

02:37:35.279 --> 02:37:37.281
A LEGAL SYSTEM THAT WE ALL KNOW

02:37:37.347 --> 02:37:39.049
AND HAVE HEARD ABOUT.

02:37:39.116 --> 02:37:40.617
AT LEAST FOR THE THE COURSE OF

02:37:40.684 --> 02:37:42.386
THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION ON HELD

02:37:42.452 --> 02:37:43.754
BACK LOGGED IT IS AND HOW

02:37:43.821 --> 02:37:45.789
DIFFICULT IT IS AND FOR THOSE

02:37:45.856 --> 02:37:47.858
WHO ARE NOT FORTUNATE TO BE.

02:37:47.925 --> 02:37:50.093
IN A FINANCIAL POSITION TO SEEK

02:37:50.160 --> 02:37:52.362
REDRESS IN THE COURTS THAT THIS

02:37:52.429 --> 02:37:53.831
IS PRECISELY I THINK WHAT WE

02:37:53.897 --> 02:37:55.499
NEED.

02:37:55.566 --> 02:37:57.234
WE NEEDED TO HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL

02:37:57.301 --> 02:37:59.203
RESPONSIBLE THAT CAN OVERSEE

02:37:59.269 --> 02:38:01.738
THESE MATTERS IN A TIMELY

02:38:01.805 --> 02:38:03.307
FASHION I THINK THIRTY DAYS.

02:38:03.373 --> 02:38:05.576
MAY BE A BIT SHORT AND IT COMES

02:38:05.642 --> 02:38:08.745
TO BUT I THINK IT'S ADMIRABLE --

02:38:08.812 --> 02:38:09.980
I I THINK I WANT TO CLARIFY A

02:38:10.047 --> 02:38:11.548
POINT I WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN I

02:38:11.615 --> 02:38:12.716
UNDERSTAND THIS.

02:38:12.783 --> 02:38:15.719
THAT IF THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH

02:38:15.786 --> 02:38:17.988
AN OMBUDSMAN DECISION TO

02:38:18.055 --> 02:38:19.489
DISCLOSE ARE NOT DISCLOSED.

02:38:19.556 --> 02:38:21.458
THAT DOES THAT FOR CLOSE OF

02:38:21.525 --> 02:38:23.894
PARTY'S ABILITY TO GO TO COURT

02:38:23.961 --> 02:38:25.829

02:38:35.105 --> 02:38:40.210
APPEALS PROCESS IN BETWEEN --

02:38:40.277 --> 02:38:42.112

THE STATE GOVERNMENT.

02:38:55.158 --> 02:38:56.760
AND THAT YOU NOW HAVE TO HAVE

02:38:56.827 --> 02:38:58.629
THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT WE ARE

02:38:58.695 --> 02:39:00.998

THE PUBLIC.

02:39:06.003 --> 02:39:08.472
IT IS COMPLETELY ON THE SIDE OF

02:39:08.538 --> 02:39:10.674
THE STATE AGENCIES AND SO AT

02:39:10.741 --> 02:39:12.643
WHAT POINT CAN'T DO WE ALLOW IS

02:39:12.709 --> 02:39:14.945
SOMEONE OF THE PUBLIC TO GET THE

02:39:15.012 --> 02:39:17.114
INFORMATION OF WHY THE DECISION

02:39:17.180 --> 02:39:18.949

02:44:54.985 --> 02:44:55.118
CASE.

02:44:55.185 --> 02:44:56.853
YOU USE IT AS ED THE EXAMPLE

SOMETHING THAT IS TRULY NOT BAIT

02:45:14.704 --> 02:45:17.607
AND I THINK IT IT CREATES A VERY.

02:45:17.674 --> 02:45:19.509
DANGEROUS PRECEDENT TO PUT THIS

02:45:19.576 --> 02:45:21.478
KIND OF POWER INSURANCE ONE

02:45:21.544 --> 02:45:23.913

THIS IS A HUGE.

02:45:45.035 --> 02:45:46.036
AND IT REQUIRES REAL

02:45:46.102 --> 02:45:49.239

BIOMETRIC DATA USED TO IDENTIFY

03:25:00.388 --> 03:25:01.756
SOMEONE IN MOST CASES YOU'RE NOT

03:25:01.822 --> 03:25:03.124
TALKING ABOUT LIKE THE ACTUAL

03:25:03.190 --> 03:25:04.892
FINGERPRINT FOR EXAMPLE.

03:25:04.959 --> 03:25:05.693
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A COMPANY

03:25:05.760 --> 03:25:07.228
TAKEN A SCAN OF A FINGERPRINT

03:25:07.294 --> 03:25:08.963
AND MAYBE THEY USE LIKE FIFTEEN

03:25:09.030 --> 03:25:09.764
DATA POINTS ARE TWENTY DATA

03:25:09.830 --> 03:25:11.599
POINTS THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE THE

03:25:11.666 --> 03:25:12.366
SAME AS WHAT ANOTHER COMPANY

03:25:12.433 --> 03:25:13.534
USES.

03:25:13.601 --> 03:25:14.435
OR THE ANYONE IS GONNA KNOW WHAT

03:25:14.502 --> 03:25:15.736
THOSE EVEN MEAN POTENTIALLY SO

03:25:15.803 --> 03:25:19.073
IF THERE IS A BREACH IT'S FAR

03:25:19.140 --> 03:25:22.209
LESS LIKELY THAT THAT KIND OF

03:25:22.276 --> 03:25:23.944
DATA WOULD LEAD.

03:25:24.011 --> 03:25:24.512
TO SOMEONE GETTING IDENTITY

03:25:24.578 --> 03:25:26.247
STOLEN AND UNFORTUNATELY YOU

03:25:26.313 --> 03:25:27.248
KNOW THAT IT'S SO IT'S A SAFER

03:25:27.314 --> 03:25:28.549
ALTERNATIVE TO VERIFY SOMEONE'S

03:25:28.616 --> 03:25:30.284
IDENTITY THAN SOCIAL SECURITY

03:25:30.351 --> 03:25:31.819
NUMBERS IT'S SOMETHING YOU WANT

03:25:31.886 --> 03:25:32.386

03:25:32.453 --> 03:25:32.987

03:25:36.757 --> 03:25:38.025
OF INJURY REQUIRED.

03:25:38.092 --> 03:25:39.493
SO EVEN IF YOU GO DOWN THE SAFER

03:25:39.560 --> 03:25:40.895
ROUTE YOU GET THE BREACH NO

03:25:40.961 --> 03:25:42.463
ONE'S BEEN INJURED YOU'RE STILL

03:25:42.530 --> 03:25:43.564
GONNA GET SUED THE SAME IF YOU

03:25:43.631 --> 03:25:45.800

RESPECTFULLY POSTED THIS BILL I

03:33:26.093 --> 03:33:27.094
THINK WE HAVE SOME FUNDAMENTAL

03:33:27.161 --> 03:33:29.229
DISAGREEMENTS WITH THE OVERALL

03:33:29.296 --> 03:33:30.597
APPROACH TAKEN BY THIS BILL.

03:33:30.664 --> 03:33:31.832
WE THINK IF WE WANT TO KEEP JOBS

03:33:31.899 --> 03:33:33.333
IN CALIFORNIA MORE PRODUCTIVE

03:33:33.400 --> 03:33:35.702

BURDEN -- ON BUSINESSES.

03:33:42.209 --> 03:33:43.010
MOST IMPORTANTLY WE DO THINK

03:33:43.076 --> 03:33:44.178
THAT THIS BILL MAKES IT UNLIKELY

03:33:44.244 --> 03:33:44.912

CALL CENTER JOBS TO CALIFORNIA --

03:33:47.314 --> 03:33:48.215
I THINK A CALL CENTER WOULD BE

03:33:48.282 --> 03:33:50.317
UNLIKELY TO RELOCATE TO

03:33:50.384 --> 03:33:51.485

03:33:56.390 --> 03:33:57.124

OFFICE IN THE SPONSOR -- ABOUT

03:34:00.494 --> 03:34:01.962
SOME -- ISSUES AND THEY'VE TAKEN

03:34:02.029 --> 03:34:03.430
SOME AMENDMENTS WHICH WE

03:34:03.497 --> 03:34:04.464
APPRECIATE I JUST WANT TO BRING

03:34:04.531 --> 03:34:06.767
A ONE ISSUE TO THE COMMITTEE'S

03:34:06.833 --> 03:34:08.268
ATTENTION.

03:34:08.335 --> 03:34:08.902
THERE'S AN EXISTING SECTION OF

03:34:08.969 --> 03:34:09.803
THE PUBLIC CONTRACTS CODE

03:34:09.870 --> 03:34:12.506
SECTION ONE TO ONE FORTY WHICH

03:34:12.573 --> 03:34:13.173
WAS ADDED BY BRINGING A BILL IN

03:34:13.240 --> 03:34:14.541
IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHICH

03:34:14.608 --> 03:34:16.677
REGULATES CERTAIN PUBLIC BENEFIT

03:34:16.743 --> 03:34:18.111
PROGRAMS AND CALL CENTERS --

03:34:18.178 --> 03:34:19.446
ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE BENEFIT

03:34:19.513 --> 03:34:21.848
PROGRAMS THAT WORK HAS TO BE

03:34:21.915 --> 03:34:23.617
PERFORMED IN CALIFORNIA.

03:34:23.684 --> 03:34:24.851
THOSE -- PROVISIONS HAVE CERTAIN

03:34:24.918 --> 03:34:26.286
EXCEPTIONS.

03:34:26.353 --> 03:34:27.487
THE STATUTE ALSO SPECIFICALLY

03:34:27.554 --> 03:34:29.423
SAYS THE LIMITATIONS DON'T APPLY

03:34:29.489 --> 03:34:31.658
IF IT WOULD VIOLATE FEDERAL LAW

03:34:31.725 --> 03:34:33.060
OR FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS -- AND

03:34:33.126 --> 03:34:34.528
WE'RE NOT SURE HOW THIS BILL

03:34:34.595 --> 03:34:36.129
RELATES TO THAT EXISTING

03:34:36.196 --> 03:34:37.130
PROVISION OF LAW WHETHER IT

03:34:37.197 --> 03:34:38.198
SUITS SUPERSEDES IT.

03:34:38.265 --> 03:34:39.466
OR NOT WE THINK THAT SHOULD BE

03:34:39.533 --> 03:34:41.568
CLARIFIED AND WE ALSO THINK --

03:34:41.635 --> 03:34:42.669
SOME LANGUAGECOULD BE ADDED TO

03:34:42.736 --> 03:34:44.371
THIS BILL SIMILAR TO THE

03:34:44.438 --> 03:34:45.372
EXISTING PUBLIC CONTRACTS COULD

03:34:45.439 --> 03:34:46.673
SECTION TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THIS

03:34:46.740 --> 03:34:48.075
DOESN'T CONTRAVENE.

03:34:48.141 --> 03:34:50.410
TRADE AGREEMENTS SO FOR THOSE

03:34:50.477 --> 03:34:51.445

WITH GREAT RESPECT FOR MISTER

03:53:23.122 --> 03:53:24.790
STONE FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

03:53:24.857 --> 03:53:26.792
AND FOR HIS REPRESENTATIVES BUT

03:53:26.859 --> 03:53:28.160
THIS IS A PROFOUND.

03:53:28.227 --> 03:53:31.130
ISSUE THAT GOES TO THE POWER AND

03:53:31.197 --> 03:53:32.732
AUTHORITY OF THE GOVERNMENT AND

03:53:32.798 --> 03:53:34.734
I THINK IT DESERVES SOME VERY

03:53:34.800 --> 03:53:36.702
THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION AND SOME

03:53:36.769 --> 03:53:38.371
MORE WORK.

03:53:38.437 --> 03:53:39.605
AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE OF THE

03:53:39.672 --> 03:53:41.440
AWESOME POWER OF THE FALSE

03:53:41.507 --> 03:53:42.742
CLAIMS ACT.

03:53:42.808 --> 03:53:44.577
THAT ACT PROVIDES FOR TROUBLE

03:53:44.643 --> 03:53:46.779
DAMAGES.

03:53:46.846 --> 03:53:49.582
ATTORNEY'S FEES -- IN THIS CASE

03:53:49.648 --> 03:53:52.118
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES AND WHEN

03:53:52.184 --> 03:53:56.622
EXTENDED TO TAX CASES -- I'VE.

03:53:56.689 --> 03:53:57.523
I COULD BE WRONG HAVE BEEN WRONG

03:53:57.590 --> 03:53:58.724
MANY MANY TIMES.

03:53:58.791 --> 03:54:00.659
BUT I DON'T SEE THE LIMITATIONS

03:54:00.726 --> 03:54:03.129
IN THE BILL TO TAX FRAUD.

03:54:03.195 --> 03:54:05.197
AND I DON'T SEE LIMITATIONS IN

03:54:05.264 --> 03:54:07.299
THE BILL TO WHISTLE BLOWERS THIS

03:54:07.366 --> 03:54:09.969
THREATENS TO CONVERT REGULAR TAX

03:54:10.035 --> 03:54:11.370
DISPUTES.

03:54:11.437 --> 03:54:13.439
WHERE THERE IS A CREDIBLE

03:54:13.506 --> 03:54:16.342
ARGUMENT ON BOTH SIDES FROM A

03:54:16.409 --> 03:54:16.909
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR

03:54:16.976 --> 03:54:18.711
DISPUTE TO A SEVEN FIGURE

03:54:18.778 --> 03:54:21.414
DISPUTE YOU HAVE TWO HUNDRED

03:54:21.480 --> 03:54:22.715
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DISPUTE?

03:54:22.782 --> 03:54:24.683
YOU GET TREBLE DAMAGES ON TOP OF

03:54:24.750 --> 03:54:27.620
THAT SO NOW YOU'RE.

03:54:27.686 --> 03:54:28.721
TO EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND AND

03:54:28.788 --> 03:54:29.855
YOU GET ATTORNEY'S FEES.

03:54:29.922 --> 03:54:31.891
POSSIBLY DELEGATED TO A PRIVATE

03:54:31.957 --> 03:54:33.759
LAWYER AND POSSIBLY TO A KEY

03:54:33.826 --> 03:54:35.461
TâM PLAINTIFF.

03:54:35.528 --> 03:54:37.196
SO THIS THREATENS TO TAKE A

03:54:37.263 --> 03:54:39.632
REGULAR TAX DISPUTE.

03:54:39.698 --> 03:54:41.934
INTO A FALSE CLAIMS ACT AND THE

03:54:42.001 --> 03:54:43.769
QUESTION IS WHETHER THAT IS

03:54:43.836 --> 03:54:46.705
PUTTING TOO MUCH AUTHORITY IN

03:54:46.772 --> 03:54:48.274
THE POWER OF THE GOVERNMENT.

03:54:48.340 --> 03:54:50.810
THE WHEN I WAS YOUNG WE TALKED

03:54:50.876 --> 03:54:52.478
ABOUT ABUSIVE TAX SHELTERS AND

03:54:52.545 --> 03:54:54.747
THE LINE BETWEEN A LEGITIMATE

03:54:54.814 --> 03:54:56.782
TAX DISPUTE AND AN ABUSIVE TAX

03:54:56.849 --> 03:54:58.717
SHELTER WAS WAS THERE CREDIBLE

03:54:58.784 --> 03:55:01.020
AUTHORITY FOR THE POSITION TAKEN

03:55:01.086 --> 03:55:02.822
BY THE TAXPAYER.

03:55:02.888 --> 03:55:04.123
AND THAT AT LEAST OUGHT TO BE

03:55:04.190 --> 03:55:06.058
INCORPORATED IT SEEMS TO ME INTO

03:55:06.125 --> 03:55:07.960
THIS BILL SO UNTIL THOSE THINGS

03:55:08.027 --> 03:55:09.595
ARE RESOLVED AND THERE ARE OTHER

03:55:09.662 --> 03:55:11.430
ISSUES HERE OF RETROACTIVITY AND

03:55:11.497 --> 03:55:12.398
OTHERS.

03:55:12.465 --> 03:55:14.166
BUT WE WOULD ASK FOR A NO VOTE

03:55:14.233 --> 03:55:15.968
AND ASK THAT WE CONTINUE HAVING

03:55:16.035 --> 03:55:17.436
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR AND

03:55:17.503 --> 03:55:18.704
SPONSORS.

AND I'M ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF

03:55:32.117 --> 03:55:33.252

03:55:36.021 --> 03:55:37.423

PROBLEMS ARE WITH THE TAX

03:55:39.058 --> 03:55:40.159
PORTION.

03:55:40.226 --> 03:55:41.494
I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS A LITTLE

03:55:41.560 --> 03:55:42.795
BIT MORE ON THE EIGHT

03:55:42.862 --> 03:55:45.331

OF THESE ARGUMENTS WERE NEBULOUS

03:55:56.575 --> 03:55:57.309
BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE A

03:55:57.376 --> 03:55:59.211
SIGNIFICANT ESPECIALLY AS THE

03:55:59.278 --> 03:56:02.448
RATE RELATED TO CONSTRUCTION.

03:56:02.515 --> 03:56:04.316

LEGITIMATE CLAIMS BECAUSE THERE

03:56:31.043 --> 03:56:33.345

03:56:49.795 --> 03:56:51.730
SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES IN

DISPUTES THAT ARE GOING ON

03:58:59.792 --> 03:59:00.793
THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT WE'RE

CAPTURING HERE THESE ARE FALSE

03:59:02.528 --> 03:59:04.730
CLAIM SO THERE'S A STANDARD THAT

THE GOVERNMENT HAS TO ESTABLISH.

03:59:07.466 --> 03:59:07.966

IF THERE'S A TAXES BE THAT'S

03:59:11.904 --> 03:59:12.638

TAXES BUTTE THE TAXPAYERS

03:59:14.239 --> 03:59:15.741

NOTHING REALLY THERE THAT WOULD

03:59:21.380 --> 03:59:22.581
LEAD TO A FALSE CLAIM.

03:59:22.648 --> 03:59:24.183
THESE ARE CASES AND WHY WERE

03:59:24.249 --> 03:59:25.484
WORKING IN THE SPACES BECAUSE

03:59:25.551 --> 03:59:26.952
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MOSTLY

03:59:27.019 --> 03:59:29.121
HEARS ABOUT CASES LIKE THIS

03:59:29.188 --> 03:59:30.856
UNDER THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT

03:59:30.923 --> 03:59:31.557
THROUGH WHISTLE BLOWERS IF

THERE'S TAX FRAUD THAT IS

03:59:33.158 --> 03:59:34.526
HAPPENING AND IT IS OBVIOUS

03:59:34.593 --> 03:59:35.627
WHERE THERE'S OTHER EVIDENCE OF

03:59:35.694 --> 03:59:37.629
IT THAT'S WHERE THE FRANCHISE

03:59:37.696 --> 03:59:37.896
TAX BOARD.

03:59:37.963 --> 03:59:39.164
WILL STEP IN.

THIS WHOLE STATUE TO SET UP

03:59:40.466 --> 03:59:40.966
BECAUSE IT WILL BE A WHISTLE

03:59:41.033 --> 03:59:42.334
BLOWER THAT IS BRINGING FORWARD

03:59:42.401 --> 03:59:44.636
TO A PROSECUTING AUTHORITY LIKE

03:59:44.703 --> 03:59:47.639

QUI TAM LAW AND SAYS THERE IS A

03:59:49.208 --> 03:59:51.009
PROBLEM HERE THEN IF THE

03:59:51.076 --> 03:59:52.811

03:59:59.818 --> 04:00:01.220
LITIGATION AND THAT'S WHY I SAY

04:00:01.286 --> 04:00:02.154

04:00:02.221 --> 04:00:04.523
OF A QUESTIONABLE ARGUMENT.

04:00:04.590 --> 04:00:06.058

04:04:43.835 --> 04:04:46.038
SCHOOL USES THIS THAT COLLECTION

04:04:46.104 --> 04:04:46.671
TECHNIQUE.

EVERY TIME IT'S USED ITS ABUSE.

04:04:53.545 --> 04:04:54.813
THE OPPOSITION SAYS THAT THIS IS

04:04:54.880 --> 04:04:55.881
JUST A WAY TO START A

04:04:55.947 --> 04:04:57.582
CONVERSATION SCHOOLS HAVE A

04:04:57.649 --> 04:04:59.985
NUMBER OF LESS OPPRESSIVE WAYS

04:05:00.052 --> 04:05:01.553
TO START THIS CONVERSATION. FOR

04:05:01.620 --> 04:05:02.854
EXAMPLE SCHOOLS CAN SUSPEND

FROM DOING NONE OF THIS.

04:05:14.166 --> 04:05:15.634
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT STUDENTS

SHOULD NOT BE AT THE MERCY OF

04:05:17.803 --> 04:05:18.303

OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WHERE

THIS PRACTICE HAS BEEN ABUSED IS

04:07:49.721 --> 04:07:52.924

TRY TO WORK WITH STUDENTS

04:07:59.631 --> 04:08:01.399

YOU KNOW THE SCHOOLS DO YOU HAVE

04:08:10.275 --> 04:08:11.443
THE ABILITY TO WITHHOLD

04:08:12.377 --> 04:08:13.311
OF OUR SCHOOLS OF INDICATED THEY

04:08:13.378 --> 04:08:14.746
DON'T LIKE TO USE THAT TACTIC

04:08:14.813 --> 04:08:16.014
BECAUSE THAT SLOWS DOWN A

04:08:16.081 --> 04:08:16.915
STUDENTS PROGRESS TOWARDS A

04:08:16.982 --> 04:08:17.582

MOTIVATION IS PRODUCE GRADUATES

04:08:39.404 --> 04:08:41.106

PREVENTS IS GETTING JOBS YEAH WE

04:08:53.718 --> 04:08:55.420
ALSO ARE MEASURED AGAINST OUR

WAS GONNA SAY THAT'S NOT THE

04:09:06.965 --> 04:09:08.433
PREFERRED MECHANISM FOR OUR

04:09:08.500 --> 04:09:10.535
INSTITUTIONS -- FOR AMONG OTHER

04:09:10.602 --> 04:09:11.770

POTENTIALLY SCHOOLS ARE ONLY

04:09:16.875 --> 04:09:18.376

THE PHONE WAS AN OPTION.

04:10:35.253 --> 04:10:36.254
AND THEN I REALIZED.

04:10:36.321 --> 04:10:39.491
HOW PROFOUND THAT IMBALANCES?

04:10:39.557 --> 04:10:42.894

04:10:48.967 --> 04:10:52.904
WHAT'S.

04:10:52.971 --> 04:10:54.372
BUT THE IDEA IS THAT NGUYEN IN

04:10:54.439 --> 04:10:56.274
INSTITUTION.

04:10:56.341 --> 04:10:57.742
THAT YOU HAVE.

04:10:57.809 --> 04:10:59.844
INVESTED IN CONSIDERABLE

04:10:59.911 --> 04:11:02.313

04:11:06.818 --> 04:11:07.485
IMBALANCE.

04:11:07.552 --> 04:11:09.554
AND I THINK I WILL CERTAINLY BE

04:11:09.621 --> 04:11:11.790
SUPPORTIVE OF THIS -- ARE THERE

DIFFICULTIES IN -- IN NOT

UNIVERSITIES YES -- BUT FROM MY

04:11:24.469 --> 04:11:26.104
LIMITED EXPERIENCE I THINK THE

04:11:26.171 --> 04:11:27.605
IDEA IS THAT WHEN YOU.

04:11:27.672 --> 04:11:30.909
CREATE IMPEDIMENTS FOR

04:11:30.975 --> 04:11:31.776
INDIVIDUALS TO MOVE FORWARD.

04:11:31.843 --> 04:11:32.911
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET YOUR

STAND IN THEIR WAY COMPLETELY IN

04:11:37.048 --> 04:11:38.550
THAT REGARD SO WITH THAT I'LL BE

04:11:38.616 --> 04:11:40.084

THIS.

04:11:45.290 --> 04:11:46.825

WORKOUT SKIN IN A CENTER ON

04:11:52.764 --> 04:11:54.499
BURKE I JUST HAD A QUESTION FOR

04:11:54.566 --> 04:11:56.000
THE AUTHORED THAT THE DIPLOMAS

04:11:56.067 --> 04:11:57.569
CAN STILL BE WITHHELD AND IT

04:11:57.635 --> 04:11:58.937
SEEMS LIKE THAT'S A BIG THING

04:11:59.003 --> 04:12:00.171
WHEN YOU GRADUATE THAT YOU WOULD

04:12:00.238 --> 04:12:03.074

04:12:04.709 --> 04:12:06.177
I THINK THAT WAS MENTIONED AS

04:12:06.244 --> 04:12:08.213
ANOTHER WAY THAT.

04:12:08.279 --> 04:12:12.951
THE SCHOOLS CAN -- COLLECT THAT.

04:12:13.017 --> 04:12:13.485
RIGHT I MEAN YEAH.

04:12:13.551 --> 04:12:14.786
TRANSCRIPT REALLY CREATE THE

04:12:14.853 --> 04:12:16.421
POWER IMBALANCE BECAUSE THAT'S

04:12:16.488 --> 04:12:18.022
REALLY THE KEY TO STOKE STUDENT

04:12:18.089 --> 04:12:19.991
MOBILITY IT'S THE IT'S THE

04:12:20.058 --> 04:12:21.493
MEMORIALIZATION OF THE COURSE

WORK THAT'S BEEN COMPLETED.

04:12:22.760 --> 04:12:24.629
THE DIPLOMA DOESN'T HAVE THE

04:12:24.696 --> 04:12:27.599
SAME SORT OF A MOBILITY

04:12:27.665 --> 04:12:29.567

04:12:29.634 --> 04:12:31.369
OFFERS.

04:12:31.436 --> 04:12:32.504
SO IT'S IT'S STILL STICK THAT

04:12:32.570 --> 04:12:33.238
CAN BE USED TIMES FOR A VERY

04:12:33.304 --> 04:12:34.072
VERY EFFECTIVE STICK BUT IT'S

04:12:34.138 --> 04:12:36.241
NOT AS BIG AS THE TRANSCRIPTS

04:12:36.307 --> 04:12:38.343
TECH PROBABLY INEFFECTIVE STICK

04:12:38.409 --> 04:12:40.612
TO ONE'S PARENTS OR FOR ONCE.

ON THE BACK OF THEIR BATHROOMS --

04:12:48.653 --> 04:12:51.155
BUT THE TRANSCRIPTS OBVIOUSLY

04:12:51.222 --> 04:12:52.257
HAVE SOME.

04:12:52.323 --> 04:12:54.692
