SO FOR SOMEONE TO GET SENT TO STATE PRISONAS WE KNOW RIGHT NOW MOST FOLKS GO TO COUNTY JAIL BECAUSE REALIGNMENT SILVA JUDGE EEMS THAT CRIME SO VICIOUS SO BAD THAT HE'S IN SOME OF THE STATE PRISON. THAT'S WHAT HE'S DOING SO WHAT IT DOESN'T DO. IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY GOOD TIME IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY PROGRAM TIME IT TAKES A WE WORK TIME THAT'S ALL IT DOES FOR STILL GETTING THOSE CREDITS. SO THE BIGGEST TAX WE WORK TIME. SO THE JUDGE SENTENCES YOU TO A SENSE. NO TAKING ACCOUNT OF ALL THE GOOD TIME WORK TIME BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH IT IS A SENTENCE. SO BUT THIS BILL SAYS IF YOU DO SOMETHING SOLD BONTA SALINAS THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DON'T GET TO GET OUT SIX MONTHS EARLY THAT'S ALL THE BILL DOES. THIS NUTRITIONAL TIME. THE JUDGE THAN SHE ORIGINALLY. THOUGHT SO THE BIG ISSUE WITH THAT. AND IT AND IT'S SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT LOOK WE SEEN FOR OUR ASIAN COMMUNITIES. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE LEGISLATURE DONE SO FAR. NOTHING PEOPLE ON THEIR HANDS ALL THESE CAUCUSES. THE TALK ABOUT THINGS OF PEOPLE'S RIGHTS WE WILL DEFEND PEOPLE WILL DEFEND OUR LGBTQ COMMUNITY. OUR API COMMUNITY. FIRMEST HOLD A STEP OUT AND GET INVOLVED I APPLAUD HIM FOR THAT. WHAT IS DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR HIS PEOPLE AND FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA. GUSTA FOR SOMETHING OTHERWISE DIFFICULT LIKE THE PROUD BOYS. THEY'RE OUT DOING THIS TYPE OF CRIME. AND THAT'S A SHAME THAT'S A SHAME WHO REPRESENT THE VICTIMS. RIVERS FOR LOCAL PEOPLE HUNDRED FORTY TWO PERCENT. IN VIOLENT CRIMES. READY TO HEAR FOR THAT 142% BUT CALIFORNIA HAS A HOTLINE SO WE CAN FIND THAT OUT REALLY. THAT IS HORRIBLE. THAT IS HORRIBLE. IT'S TIME TO STEP UP AND SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH AND NOT JUST THIRTY EIGHT HE WILL DO SOMETHING LET'S DO SOMETHING IS NOT THAT DATA SAID IF SOMEONE IF YOU BEAT UP OLD MAN WITHIN A SERVICEABLE OLD. ASIAN LADY BEAT HER UP YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE TWO BUTTONS JAIL AND NOT GET OUT EARLY. SO IT'S ONE LESS THING TO PICK YOUR PICK IN THE PERPETRATOR THE PROBABLE IT'S- THE TICKET CAL COMMUNAL BETWEEN. SO WITH THAT- I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER I THANK YOU FOR SLOW- I'M- I'M PROBABLY ONE OF THE FEW. THAT REALLY UNDERSTANDS. WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE SINGLED OUT REMEMBER TARGET. ON YOU AS A BLACK ELECTED OFFICIAL- OR EVEN TO GO TO OTHER CAUCUSES AND OTHER MEMBERS WHO SAID MAY HAVE SAID IT'S NOT OUR ISSUE. WE NOW KNOW. IT'S ALL OF OUR ISSUES. EVERY LAST ONE OF US IS OUR ISSUE. AND I THINK IT'S BECOME VERY CLEAR NOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER BECAUSE SAID IT SAID WHAT SHOULD WE DO NOW. I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE GENERAL. WHICH IS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. ALTOGETHER WHICH INCLUDES HATE CRIMES ARE SPECIALLY HATE CRIMES AND- WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT AND I WOULD LIKE. TWO OF MY COLLEAGUES. FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TO JOIN WITH ME TO TRY TO CRAFT A DOMESTIC TERRORIST BILL. BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST A WHITE OR BLACK PINK OR WHITE OR LATINO THING OR LIKE OR OR OR WHITE OR API. WE'VE GOT SOME WE HAVE AFRICAN AMERICANS DON'T THAT MAY HAVE SOME PROBLEMS SO HE- DOES NOT HAVE A COLOR LINE IT IS PERVASIVE AMONGST EVERY COLOR LINE NOT JUST ONE SO IT IS A GENERAL CAUCUS PROBLEM. AND WHEN IT COMES TO COMES TO D. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRANSGENDER AND OTHERS IT IS OUT OF CONTROL SO WE NEED. TO CUT WE'D ACTUALLY DO NEED TO COME TOGETHER AND FIGURE THIS OUT- I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO SAY PEOPLE WHO PUT TARGETS ON A BLACK MAN THAT THAT'S A HATE CRIME. BUT A. . SIX SIX WHICH WOULD MAKE THAT AND THAT'S THAT'S NOT A VIOLENT. AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAD TO EXPRESS TO ME MAKE ME UNDERSTAND. THAT IS NOT A VIOLENT HATE CRIME THAT HE DIDN'T THINK IT ROSE TO THE LEVEL. OF MY SECURITY MY FAMILY SECURITY WITH THE SECURITY. OF MY STAFF. AND SO. WHILE I BELIEVE THIS MEASURE MAY NOT COMPLETELY GET TO IT AND I LAST MEMBERS TO VOTE NO. BUT I WOULD ASK THAT WE ALL VOTE YES LATER. TO COME UP WITH THE OVERALL PLAN TO GET THIS DONE I AGREE WITH BOTH OF YOU. THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO SIT ON OUR HANDS AND WE COME UP WITH A COPY HAS A BILL TO ACTUALLY TACKLE THIS. IN ITS ENTIRETY. NOT JUST NOT JUST A PROBLEM FOR IT BUT EVEN PEOPLE WHO. WHO ALL RIGHTS AND TERRIBLE THINGS WE NEED TO. WE SHOULD REALLY GET WE REALLY NEED TO NAIL THIS BECAUSE DOMESTIC TERRORISM SEEMS TO BE THE HARDEST THING. AND NO ONE'S TACKLE UNIT IN CALIFORNIA IN A IN A IN A SUBSTANTIVE WAY. SO I BOB. I WILL TAKE A BACKSEAT LET YOU TAKE THE LEAD ABROAD TAKE THE LEAD I AM GOING TO TAKE THE LEAD. BUT PLEASE HELP ME WITH THAT. UNFORTUNATELY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. CALDERON ON AB TWO SIX SIX BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOPER THE MISSION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. NO JONES SAWYER NOW LACKEY LACKEY HI BARRICADE HANNAH. QUIRK NOW CORK NOW SANTIAGO. C. R. TWO. HI THERE TELL I WICKS. WICKS NOW LEAD. LEAN NOW. UNFORTUNATE MEASURE FAILS BUT THE IDEA THE CONCEPT IS NOT. OKAY. TRYING TO CRIMINALIZE EVERY STEP HAS SOME OF THE PRISONERS YOUR SOLUTION THANKS. WHAT WAS THAT. FOR READ THE NEXT WE HAVE- MISTREATMENT. A. B. SIX SEVEN NINE ARE IN CUSTODY INFORMANTS PROHIBITS THE USE OF TESTIMONY BY. CUSSED A BITE BECAUSE HE INFORMED. THANK YOU- MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL OF THEIR HARD WORK AND THEIR HELP WITH THIS BILL INCOMES IN CUSTODY INFORMANTS HAVE PROPOSED HAVE PROVEN TO BE A SIGNIFICANT CAUSE OF WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE IN CALIFORNIA THERE HAVE BEEN TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN KNOWN EXONERATIONS. OF THESE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN CASES NINETEEN INVOLVED FALSE CLAIMS OF JAIL HOUSE INFORMANTS EIGHTEEN TO THE CENTRAL INDIVIDUALS ARE SERVING LIFE SENTENCES AND COLLECTIVELY THESE MEN AND WOMEN SPEND THREE HUNDRED AND FIVE YEARS WRONGFULLY INCARCERATED. NATIONWIDE SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE WE'VE KNOWN THAT 17% OF WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS. HAD TO DO WITH INACCURATE TESTIMONY WITH FROM JAIL HOUSE INFORMANTS AND I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU. THAT IF WE KNEW THAT THERE WAS A TEST A FINGERPRINT TEST OR D. N. AND DNA TESTS THAT WE KNEW WAS 17% INACCURATE WE WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT TEST TO BE USED. TO INCARCERATE PEOPLE TO CONVICT PEOPLE OF SERIOUS CRIMES. THE USE OF IN CUSTODY INFORMANTS IN CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS. BY ITHAS BEEN A LONG TIME INVESTIGATIVE TOOL BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT DESPITE SCANDALS REVEALING THE CONSTITUTIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE USE OF INFORMANTS AND THEIR APPARENT ABILITY TO LOOK THE TO LIFE THE PRACTICE CONTINUES TO THIS DAY. RECENTLY AN ORANGE COUNTY THEY HAVE FACED NATIONAL CRITICISM FOR THEIR SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT USE OF INCENTIVIZED INFORMANTS TO ELICIT ELICIT INCRIMINATING INFORMATION FROM INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS TO SKIRT CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS THIS IS BEEN. WRITTEN ABOUT EXTENSIVELY IN THE L. A. TIMES AND ELSEWHERE AND IS REALLY BROUGHT GREAT SHAME TO THAT POLICE DEPARTMENT AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT OUR OWN SUPREME COURT JUSTICE HERE IN CALIFORNIA HAS ASKED THE LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS AND SET STRONG PARAMETERS. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFER OF BENEFITS IN RETURN FOR PROVIDING INFORMATION INCENTIVIZES THOSE IN CUSTODY FABRICATE TESTIMONY IN EXCHANGE FOR THESE BENEFITS. HOWEVER OFTEN THESE BENEFITS ARE REALLY PROVIDED A REVEALED AHEAD OF THE INFORMANT'S TESTIMONY. PROTECTS PROTECTING IT FROM EFFECTIVE CROSS EXAMINATION. IF THE DEFENSE WAS TO OFFER IN ADVANCE INCENTIVES TO A DEFENSE WITNESS THIS WOULD BE CONSIDERED TAMPERING OR BRIBE REALLY IN THERE FOR ILLEGAL. WHAT THEY DO IS THEY GO TO THESE JAIL HOUSE INFORMANTS AND IT'S KIND OF A WINK WINK TESTIFIED THEY DO IT KNOWING FULL WELL THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BENEFIT FROM IT IF THEY MADE THEM THAT OFFER AHEAD OF TIME THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED BRIBERY AND YET WE ALLOW IT TO BE DONE ON THE REAR END. LAST YEAR JUSTICE COURT IN LIEU OF THE SUPREME CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT CALLED UPON THE LEGISLATURE TO DO SOMETHING. ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT'S USE OF INCENTIVIZE INFORMANTS BECAUSE OF THE PRACTICES DIRECTOR CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS AND PUBLIC SAFETY I PUTTING A PERKINS AGENT IN A JAIL CELL WITH SOMEONE WHO'S ON TRIAL AND NOT TELLING THEM THAT WHATEVER THEY SAY MIGHT BE USED AGAINST THEM. THAT SKIRTS THE MIRANDA WARNING COMPLETELY AND I DON'T SEE HOW WE ARE ABLE TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA. SB SIX SEVENTY NINE IT WOULD END THIS PRACTICE TO PROTECT THE INNOCENT AND THE INTEGRITY OF PROSECUTIONS FOR VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF CRIMES. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT THIS MORNING R. SCOTT SANDERS A CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY THAT WORKED ON TWO DEATH PENALTY CASES AT THE SAME TIME INVOLVING THE SAME INFORMANT. AND IN THE PROCESS AND BILLING ONE OF THE LARGEST INFORMANT SCANDAL IN THE COUNTRY I MELISSA DAGO CONNELL A STAFF ATTORNEY WITH THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INNOCENCE PROJECT IN SANTA CLARA. I APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION OF THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL AND I WOULD REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. AND YOUR YOU HAVE ANY WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. FOR THEY- MISTER SANDERS AND MISSILE CONNELL YOU MAY BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS SCOTT SANDERS IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WELL REPRESENTING DEFENDANTS IN TWO SEPARATE DEATH PENALTY CASES I LEARNED THAT BOTH OF MY CLIENTS HAVE BEEN APPROACHED BY THE SAME JAIL HOUSE INFORMANT YOUR PART IN THE COUNTY JAIL. WITNESSES PRESENTED THIS IS A COINCIDENCE AND DENIED A COORDINATED EFFORT TO DIRECT INFORMANTS TO QUESTION DEFENDANTS ABOUT THEIR CASES. HOWEVER IT'S THREE IN ONE RAVELLO IS ACTUALLY TAKING PLACE WITHIN OUR JAILS THE CASE AGAINST MY CLIENT WHO KILLED EIGHT PEOPLE AND RATTLED AS WELL. THE MISCONDUCT WOULD LEAD FIRST TO THE REFUSAL THE DA'S OFFICE IN TWO THOUSAND. FIFTEEN FURTHER DISCOVERIES OF HIDDEN DATABASES THAT LOGS IN UNTRUTHFUL TESTIMONY LED THE TRIAL JUDGE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO PROHIBIT A SENTENCE OF DEATH. IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY FOUR YEARS AFTER THE COURT OF APPEALS AFFIRMED THE REFUSAL THE DA'S OFFICE. ADMITTED THAT SOON AFTER THE APPELLATE RULING THE AGENCY ACTUALLY BEGAN WITHHOLDING CRITICAL INFORMED EVIDENCE. THAT HAD BEEN UNCOVERED BUT THIS IS REALLY JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG AS WE LOOK BACK OVER THE DECADES. IDENTICAL LEGAL KIND OF GIVEN ORCHESTRATED IN CASE AFTER CASE IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE WE ARE POISED TO LEARN THE RESULTS OF THE DOJ CIVIL RIGHTS INVESTIGATION. APPEARS AT THE AGENCY MAY BE FOCUSED ON A HUNDRED CASES THEY'RE ALREADY BEEN MORE THAN TWENTY INCLUDING MULTIPLE MURDER CASES HAVE BEEN REDUCED. AT A SCENE REDUCE SENTENCES NEW TRIALS AND DISMISSED CHARGES. I SHOULD HAVE THIS IS EMPHASIZED THAT BY NO MEANS IS ORANGE COUNTY AN OUT LIAR MANY COUNTIES MAY NOT EXPERIENCE THEIR SCANDAL. YET OKAY HAVE THE SAME ISSUES BENEATH THE SURFACE BEFORE ORANGE COUNTY THE LARGEST INFORMERS SCANDAL OCCURRED IN LA IN THE EIGHTIES AND EARLY NINETIES. LESSONS WERE IGNORED NOT JUST BY ORANGE COUNTY HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THESE ISSUES THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHAT I'VE HEARD AGAIN AND AGAIN. HOW COUNCIL HAVE NOT BEEN TOLD ABOUT RECORDS THE REASONS INFORMANTS REMOVED IN THE JAIL DOCUMENTATION OF PRIOR PERFORMANCE NOTES AND RECORDS. ABOUT TACK ACTS WITH INFORMANTS WHAT THIS IN QUESTIONING MEANS IS A KEY IN FOUR. KEY INFORMANT EVIDENCE HAS BEEN HIDDEN RECORDS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED AND KEEP POLICIES WERE NEVER PUT IN PLACE. THE TRUTH IS THAT INFORMANTS ARE FIXTURES WHICH IS WHY. IT'S BEEN SO APPEALING OVER THE YEARS BUT THEY COMBINE SEEN MOST OFTEN WHEN THERE'S AN OBVIOUS WEAKNESS IN THE CASE. CASES WERE ONE INCENTIVIZE WITNESSED UP QUESTIONABLE HONESTY CAN. BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A WRONGFUL IN. AND IT. TO QUIT. ONE OF THE REASON WHY THIS PER. LIKE YOU SAY LEGISLATION IS SO. IS THE LOCATION OF WHERE THE INFORMANTS WITH BEHIND THE JAIL. THERE IS NO. THAT ONE. RECALL DISCLOSURES A JAIL DEPUTIES WE DID NOT AN UNSPOKEN AGREEMENT CORPS SECRET BENEFIT THAT THAT'S TO BE PROVIDED IN THE FUTURE. NOR WILL ANY WILL ENSURE THE INFORMANTS PASSED DECEPTION IN THE JAIL OR PRIOR INFORMING EFFORTS WILL BE FULLY DISCLOSED. IN ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS EXIST IN ADDITION TO THE FACT INFORMANTS ARE APPROPRIATELY DESCRIBED AS THE MOST UNRELIABLE WITNESS IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THEREFORE WELL WE WILL NEVER FULLY CORRECT WHICH GOING SO TERRIBLY WRONG. BECAUSE OF THE USE OF JAIL HOUSE INFORMANTS THIS BILL APPROPRIATELY RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT CLOSING OUR EYES TO THE COMPELLING LESSONS. WE HAVE ALREADY LEARNED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NEXT GOOD AFTERNOON GENTLEMEN COMMITTEE MEMBER MELISSA O'CONNELL FROM THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INNOCENCE PROJECT I WAS ONE OF THE ATTORNEYS FOR OUR CLIENT JACK FAGAN. JACK LOCK THIRTY FOUR YEARS OF HIS LIFE INCARCERATED FOR A CRIME HE DID NOT COMMIT. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX JACK WAS CONVICTED OF FIRST DEGREE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE MURDER AND SENTENCED TO LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE. BEHIND THE TESTIMONY AS TO INCENTIVIZE JAILHOUSE INFORMANT WHO CLAIMED HE CONFESSED TO THEM. MAN MADE A CAREER OF INFORMING ONE WAS INFORMING ON AT LEAST THREE OTHER CASES AT THE SAME TIME OF JACK. THEY BOTH HAD LENGTHY CRIMINAL HISTORY INCLUDING CONVICTIONS FOR BURGLARY. ROBBERY AND FALSELY IMPERSONATING A POLICE OFFICER. AND BOTH RECEIVED LENIENCY FOR THEIR TESTIMONY AGAINST JACK. JACK ALWAYS MAINTAINED HIS INNOCENCE BUT IT WOULD TAKE OVER THIRTY YEARS SEVENTEEN OF WHICH FOR WITH OUR OFFENSE. TO CHANGES IN THE LAW AND THE ADVENT OF DNA EVIDENCE SHOWING JACK COMPLETE ABSENCE FROM THE CRIME SCENE AND THE PRESENCE OF OR MORE LIKELY PERPETRATORS. FOR THE COURT OF APPEALS TO REALIZE JACK INNOCENT. AND THE INFORMANT BLYDE. ON OCTOBER ELEVENTH TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN AB SEVENTY FIVE YEARS OLD PARTIALLY BLIND AND AFTER MOVING THIRTY FOUR YEARS OF HIS LIFE WRONGLY INCARCERATED. I CAME HOME FROM R. J. DONOVAN STATE PRISON A FREE MAN. IT WOULD TAKE. OKAY IF YOU COULD IMAGINE IT WOULD TAKE FAR MORE TIME THAN IS ALLOWED TODAY TO SHARE THE LOSS AND PAIN BACK FACTORED IN THE THIRTY FOUR YEAR. THE GENTLEMAN. WAS NOT EASY. BUT JACKSON BALLOT ADVOCATE FOR CHANGES IN THE LAWS REGARDING INFORMANTS THAT NO ONE WOULD FOLLOW IN HIS SHOES. I AM NOT IN STRONG VOICE AND JACK. BUT THE REASON I'M HERE TODAY TO SHARE HIS STORY AND JACK IS NOT. BECAUSE ON DECEMBER TENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE DAYS BEFORE JACK FOURTEENTH MONTH HOME. WE LOST JACK BECAUSE THE NINETEEN. LEGISLATURE PASSES GRAND LAWS BECAUSE OF GREAT TRAGEDIES SUFFERED BY A SINGLE PERSON AB SIX SEVEN NINE IS THE GRAND LAW AND IT'S A POWERFUL ONE BUT WE OWE IT TO JACK TO ENSURE NO MORE GREAT TRAGEDIES OCCUR DUE TO THE FALSEHOOD A JAILHOUSE INFORMANT. WE THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBERS FRIEDMAN FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND WE RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. BUT THE ANY MEMBERS IN THE IN FORTY TWO OH TWO WHO ARE IN SUPPORT.

GOOD AFTERNOON JASMINE HARRIS BUT THE CALIFORNIA AND COALITION AND SMART JUSTICE CALIFORNIA IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU NOT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- COREY CELLS ALONG SEAT SSA LA MORE CD HEY. ON THE FRONT. IN OPPOSITION SB SIX SEVEN NINE MISTER. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS LARRY MORSE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO EIGHTY SIX SEVEN NINE THE BILL SEEKS TO REPEAL THE TRUTH AND EVIDENCE PROVISION IN ARTICLE ONE SECTION TWENTY NINE OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION WHICH STATES THAT EVIDENCE SHALL NOT BE EXCLUDED IN ANY CRIMINAL PROCEEDING THE BILL WOULD CREATE A BLANKET PROHIBITION OF ANY. ANY TESTIMONY BERMAN IN CUSTODY INFORMANT NO MATTER HOW MANY OTHERS OUTSIDE OF CUSTODY CORROBORATED THAT TESTIMONY IT IS NOT LIMITED TO INCENTIVIZE TESTIMONY WE ARE UNAWARE OF A SINGLE STATE IN THE COUNTRY THAT IS ADOPTED SUCH A POLICY WELL THE BILL FOCUSES ON A FEW EXAMPLES OF CONVICTIONS THAT WERE OVERTURNED AT LEAST IN PART BECAUSE OF INFORMANT TESTIMONY IT IGNORES THE FACT THAT TESTIMONY FROM IN CUSTODY INDIVIDUALS HAS BEEN USED TO SOLVE SCORES I'M SERIOUS AND VIOLENT CRIMES. UNDER THIS BILL A PROSECUTOR WOULD BE PREVENTED FROM USING THE TESTIMONY OF A MISDEMEANOR DEFENDANTS IN CUSTODY FOR SAY A D. Y. WHO OVER HERE'S ANOTHER IN CUSTODY INDIVIDUAL ADMIT TO A SERIES OF MURDERS OR RAPES OR ARMED ROBBERIES OR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR ANY CRIME THE TESTIMONY WOULD BE PROHIBITED EVEN THOUGH THE SO CALLED IN BECAUSE THE INFORMANT VOLUNTEERED THE INFORMATION UPON HIS RELEASE FROM CUSTODY AND DID NOT SEEK ANY MONETARY BENEFIT OR LEGAL ADVANTAGE. FROM PROVIDING THE INFORMATION AND IT IS CORROBORATED BY NONCUSTODIAL WITNESSES CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAD BEEN PLACED AMONG THE STRICTEST PROTECTION REGARDING IN CUSTODY AND FORMER TESTIMONY INCLUDING A REQUIREMENT THAT SUCH TESTIMONY BE CORROBORATED AND THAT COULD NOT BE CORROBORATED BY ANOTHER INMATE UNLESS THE PROSECUTION COULD ESTABLISH THERE WAS NO. COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ME AND MY- FORMS ON INCOME IN. SIMONI WERE APPROVED IN THE TWELVE. THE SPONSOR ABOUT FOR IN EXAM OF CASE SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHERE ONE THE JURY WAS INSTRUCTED ON HOW DO YOU INFORM ATTACHED TO MONIQUE AND TO. THERE WAS CORROBORATED FALSE TESTIMONY OF AN IN CUSTODY INFORMANTS THAT RESULTED IN AN INNOCENT PERSON BEING CONVICTED. THE CONVICTION OF A SINGLE PERSON FOR A CRIME HERE SHE DIDN'T COMMIT IS TOO MANY. BUT IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE SCALE OF THE ALLEGED PROBLEM THIS BILL PURPORTS TO ADDRESS THE SPONSORS WOULD NEED TO PROVIDE DATA THAT SHOWS HOW MANY TIMES. INTERCITY INFORMANT TESTIMONY PROVED TO BE RELIABLE TESTIMONY AND HELPED CONVICT A GUILTY PERSON. WE WOULD IMAGINE THAT THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL HAVE EXAMPLES OF I WOULD DISCUSS THE MONEY IN SERIOUS CASES. IN WHICH DNA OR LATER EVIDENCE SHOWED EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY TO HAVE BEEN ROCK WILL BE NEXT BE SEEKING TO EXCLUDE EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY. SIMILARLY WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF FALSE CONFESSIONS THAT WERE NOT COERCED THAT HAVE LED TO INNOCENT PEOPLE BEING CONVICTED AND INCARCERATED. ARE WE NEXT GOING TO EXCLUDE CONFESSIONS FROM BEING ENTERED INTO EVIDENCE. AS I USED TO TELL JURIES WHEN TRYING CASES THE JURY SYSTEM ISN'T PERFECT BECAUSE NO SYSTEM DEVISED BY MORTALS COULD BE. HOWEVER IS THE BEST SYSTEM HUMANITY HAS EVER KNOWN AND IT IS BASED ON RESPECT FOR THE INTELLIGENCE OF JURORS. THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO PROPERLY ASSESS ALL EVIDENCE INCLUDING EVIDENCE THAT COMES FROM LAY WITNESSES EXPERT WITNESSES AND YES IN CUSTODY INFORMANTS. THAT COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE IS REINFORCED BY JUDGES WHO GUIDE THEM AND EVALUATING SUCH TESTIMONY. THE REPEAL OF THE TRUTH AND EVIDENCE PROVISIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION ADVOCATED BY THIS BILL. IS UNNECESSARY. AND WE URGE A NO VOTE. THE SUSPECT IS. THANK YOU MISTER MORRIS. MRS ALSO. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN COREY CELLS CELL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. AS MY COLLEAGUE STATED CURRENT LAW PROVIDES PLENTIFUL PROTECTIONS FOR DEFENDANT WHEN IT COMES TO THE USE OF INFORMANTS TESTIMONY SIX EIGHTY SIX SEVENTY NINE ELIMINATES THOSE SAFEGUARDS AND SIMPLY BEAMS ALL SUCH EVIDENCE OR TESTIMONY INADMISSIBLE. WITHOUT REGARD TO THE SEVERITY OF THE CRIME THE NATURE OF THE INFORMATION FOR THE RELIABILITY OF THE PROVIDER. THIS BILL COULD IMPACT THE PROSECUTION OF ANY NUMBER OF CRIMES THAT WILL LIKELY MAKE CRIMES COMMITTED IN PRISONS AND JAILS EVEN HARDER TO PROSECUTE. THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION BECAUSE OF THE HIGH BAR FOR MEASURES THAT ATTEMPT TO EXCLUDE ANY RELEVANT EVIDENCE FROM ANY CRIMINAL PROCEEDING AND FOR GOOD REASON. COURTS AND JURIES MUST BE PERMITTED TO JUDGE WHAT MIGHT PROVE TO BE RELEVANT INFORMATION. WITHOUT THE ARTIFICIAL AND ARBITRARY BRAND CREATED BY THIS MEASURE. FOR THOSE REASONS AND- STATED- CSSA MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB SIX SEVENTY NINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE ANY WITNESSES IN THE- IN THE ROOM FORTY TWO- TO IN OPPOSITION ANY ON THE VIDEO SCREEN IN OPPOSITION. EIGHTEEN T. OPERATOR YOU MAY NOW GO TO THE PHONE LINES- FOR AB SIX SEVEN NINE. IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB SIX SEVEN NINE TO PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONCE AGAIN FOR OPPOSITION OF AB HERE SIX SEVEN NINE PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE ONE COMMENT IN Q. AND WHAT A LINE ONE FORTY FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD. ALL MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BRANDON UP ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU I HAVE NO% FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME THANK YOU WILL NOW BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. MISTER HOLCOMB J. R. TERM MR LACKEY. EMPRESS POWER CAN'T MISS FRIEDMAN THANK YOU FOR HAVING CONCERN FOR THE SEVENTEEN THAT ARE WRONGFULLY CONVICTED. AND I SHARE THOSE CONCERNS AND I THINK WE NEED TO WORK ON WAYS TO ENSURE. JUST AS THE ONE OF THE WITNESSES STATED THAT LESS AND LESS OF THAT HAPPENS. BUT WHEN I LOOK OUT ON OUR LITTLE AUDIENCE THAT DOESN'T EXIST HERE TODAY. IF YOU TAKE EVERYONE OF THOSE CHAIRS EXCEPT FOR THE LAST ROW THAT GENTLEMAN AND PUT PEOPLE IN THERE AND THEN FILL THIS UNDER SECTION THAT'S HERE. WITH ONE ROW PLUS FOUR SEATS. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PEOPLE THE WRONGFULLY CONVICTED BY THIS PROCESS. AND PEOPLE THAT YOU SAY HAVE BEEN CONVICTED BY THE PROCESS AND THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN CONVICTED BY THAT PROCESS REPRESENT RAPISTS pMURDERERS. ROBBERS VIOLENT FELONS- IT RUNS THE GAMUT AND THOSE PEOPLE. THEIR FAMILIES WANT JUSTICE. AND THEIR FAMILIES DESERVE JUSTICE AND TO SAY BECAUSE THE SEVENTEEN WE NEED TO WORK ON THEIR PROBLEMS A LITTLE BIT MORE MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT UNJUSTLY. CONVICTED AND WE'RE GOING TO SACRIFICE THE OTHERS IT'S A LITTLE TOO MUCH FOR ME. SO I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL- I THINK THERE ARE WAYS AND TEY'RE BECOMING BETTER WAYS OF ENSURING THAT WE DON'T HAVE FALSE TESTIMONY. AND THAT THOSE- WAYS THAT THAT ARE ARE BEING. AND YET THE- HOW HOW WOULD I WANT TO SAY THAT THE FACTORS THAT ARE IN COMMON THEY'RE CONVICTING PEOPLE THAT SHOULDN'T BE CONVICTED ARE BEING FLESHED OUT WHAT TECHNOLOGY AND- AND FRANKLY WITH COMMON SENSE- WE WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE ON THAT. BUT WE CAN'T SACRIFICE THE OTHER 83% OF SUCCESSFUL CONVICTIONS BECAUSE OF THAT. THANK YOU. CAN I GET YOUR CORRECT CAN I JUST CLARIFY SOMETHING RUDE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. THE SADISTIC WAS NOT THAT OUT OF ALL OF THE TECH THE CONVICTIONS THAT WERE OBTAINED WITH JAIL HOUSE INFORMANTS 17% OF THOSE ARE INACCURATE. IT'S OUT OF ALL THE CONVICTIONS MOST OF WHICH DON'T USE JAILHOUSE CONFORMANCE OF ALL THE WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS 17% OF THAT TOTAL. EXCLUDING THE ONES THAT DIDN'T USED JAILHOUSE INFORMANTS 70% OF PEOPLE THAT WE KNOW WERE WRONGFULLY CONVICTED SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE. HAD TO YOU HAD. THE USE OF ITACCURATE OF LYING JAILHOUSE INFORMANTS I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT SO THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND THIS INTERESTED LACKEY THREE PERCENT. IS ALSO THE SAME CATEGORY. OKAY MR LACKEY. YEAH I THINK YOU YOU DO BRING UP A- A CONCERN AND I DO BELIEVE THE NET CUSSED INFORMANT'S TESTIMONY. SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION AND CLEARLY INCENTIVIZE TESTIMONY NOT USED. HOWEVER I THINK THE BAND IS TOO STRONG. AND I THINK. FOR EXAMPLE I THINK THAT- FLAT BAND. OF THIS KIND OF EVIDENCE WILL MAKE INVESTIGATION IN PRISON CRIMES NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE SO I THINK THAT THAT'S- THAT'S MY CONCERN AND I DO THINK YOU HAVE A STRONG ISSUE HERE THE DESERVES. SIGNIFICANT ATTENTION I JUST DON'T THINK THIS QUITE I THINK THIS A LITTLE TOO HEAVY. AND SO I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT BUT I DO SUPPORT YOUR EFFORTS AND THE PERSPECTIVE OF TAKING A LOOK AT IT BECAUSE OF THE TESTIMONY. THANK YOU SPARKING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- I WANT TO START BY THINKING THE AUTHOR FOR THIS WORK I LIKE YOUR WITNESSES REPRESENTED A MAN ON DEATH ROW WHO WAS PUT THERE FOR TEN YEARS- WRONGFULLY CONVICTED USING A JAILHOUSE INFORMANT. AND HE LOST TEN YEARS OF HIS LIFE HE WASN'T OUT OF JAIL WHEN HIS GRANDDAUGHTER WAS BORN HE WAS IN ISOLATION ON DEATH ROW FOR THOSE YEARS WHICH YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED HIS MENTAL STATE. AND HE WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO END UP WITH. A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR WHO IS WILLING TO TAKE ON HIS CASE PRO BONO. AND AS A RESULT HE ENDED UP WITH LAWYERS THE COULD TAKE ON HIS CASE MYSELF AND MY TEAM. AND WE GOT HIM OUT. THAT WAS TEN YEARS LATER YOU HEARD ABOUT. THE GENTLEMAN THIS LAWYER REPRESENTED THIRTY SEVEN YEARS LATER. SO I ALSO WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT WE DON'T KNOW ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WRONGFULLY CONVICTED. THE NUMBER IS THAT MISS FRIEDMAN IS DISCUSSING ARE THE ONES THAT WE HAVE FOUGHT HARD TO GET RELEASED TO THERE ARE MANY MORE OF THEM I BELIEVE IN JAIL THAN THOSE THAT WE TALK ABOUT AND KNOW ABOUT. AND. TO HAVE. LIVED AND WORKED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND SEE THE FAILURE OF OUR SYSTEM. AND YES SOMETIMES IT WORKS AND WHEN IT WORKS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND PEOPLE DESERVE JUSTICE AND SOMETIMES IT FAILS PEOPLE AND IT FAILED THE VICTIMS IN THE CASE THAT I WORKED ON AS WELL. BECAUSE YEARS LATER WE WERE LETTING A MAN WHO DIDN'T COMMIT THAT CRIME AND THEY DIDN'T GET JUSTICE BECAUSE THE PERSON ACTUALLY DID KILL THOSE FAMILY MEMBERS. HAD WALKED THE STREETS ALL THOSE YEARS AND SO WE'RE THEIR WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS I BELIEVE THE VICTIMS HAVE BEEN FILLED AS WELL I DON'T BELIEVE IT IS JUST THE PERSON WHO IS IN JAIL EVERYBODY HAS BEEN FELT IN THAT MOMENT BECAUSE I CRIME HAPPENED. AND SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WORKS. AND IT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY. THAT WE ARE NOT INCARCERATING SOMEONE FOR ONE DAY FOR A CRIME THEY DIDN'T COMMIT. WE HAVE TAKEN THEIR FREEDOM AWAY AND WE NEED TO TAKE THAT INCREDIBLY INCREDIBLY SERIOUSLY. WHICH IS WHY IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WE GIVE EXTRA PROTECTION THAT'S WHY WE PROVIDE COUNSEL PRO BONO. RIGHT THROUGH PUBLIC DEFENDERS ARE COMING JUSTICE SYSTEM. SOMETHING WE DON'T DO IN CIVIL SYSTEM. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE TAKING SOMEONE'S FREEDOM AWAY IS SO IMPORTANT THAT THEY DESERVE EVERY POSSIBLE PROTECTION. AND THIS IS GETTING A PROBLEM THAT IS VERY REAL AND I'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND. AND I THINK THAT I REALLY WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR AND THOSE THAT ARE BRINGING THIS WORD FOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION BUT I WANT TO ADDRESSING US INCENTIVES ACTUALLY NOT ACCURATE. SO THE BILL. DEFINES IN CUSTODY IN FORMAT AS SOMEONE OTHER THAN A CODEFENDANT AND ACCOMPLICE A CO CONSPIRATOR OR PERCIPIENT WITNESS. SO FOR JAIL FOR CRIMES COMMITTED IN JAIL. SOMEBODY WAS IN CUSTODY WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE THINGS. MAYBE THEY WITNESSED IT. MAYBE THEY'RE A CO CONSPIRATOR AND THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO TESTIFY UNDER THIS BILL. SO THAT IS ACTUALLY NOT I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT INACCURACY BECAUSE THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND I WAS ACTUALLY WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THE BILL. SOMETHING I LOOKED INTO. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A- EVEN IF. THAT'S A CRIME WAS COMMITTED ONE OF THE CO CONSPIRATORS GOES TO JAIL. AND IS NOW IN CUSTODY THAT PERSON SHOULD BE ABLE TO TESTIFY. AND YOUR BILL ALLOWS THAT AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AN IMPORTANT EXCEPTION SO. DESPITE WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS SAID THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE BAN. IT IS A BAN ON THOSE THAT ARE USING THIS IN CUSTODY INFORMANT TO. GET THE PRIVILEGES THAT THEY GET BY DOING IT AND THAT IS. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THIS BILL. WHICH IS NOTHING STOPS IN IN CUSTODY INDIVIDUAL FROM COMING FORWARD. TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OR TO ANYBODY AND SAYING. I HEARD THIS GUY SAY HE COMMITTED THIS CRIME. AND HELPING SOLVE THAT CRIME. AND THEN HAVING LAW ENFORCEMENT GO OUT SOLVE THAT CRIME GET THE CORROBORATING EVIDENCE. AND PUT ON A CASE AND PUT THAT PERSON IN JAIL. THANK HAS TO BE INFORMED IS IMPORTANT THEY NO LONGER ARE ADMISSIBLE IN A COURT OF LAW. BUT THEY SERVED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN SOLVING THAT CRIME THAT IS STILL ABSOLUTELY ALLOWABLE UNDER THIS IS. ABOUT THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE EVIDENCE WHICH IS DIFFERENT. THAN THEIR ROLE IN SOLVING THE CRIME AND I THINK BOTH OF THOSE POINTS ARE REALLY CRITICAL AND WHY THIS BILL IS WELL CRAFTED IN WHITE GETS IT EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE ASKING WHICH IS. WHAT WE ARE PUTTING FORWARD IN A COURT OF LAW TO PUT SOMEONE IN JAIL. SHOULD BE RELIABLE TESTIMONY. AND THEY'RE SUCH SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR RELIABILITY THIS TESTIMONY DO WE NEED TO LOOK HARD AT OURSELVES AND SAY IS THIS APPROPRIATE. I THINK THAT'S THE QUESTION BEING ASKED AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I JUST WANNA MAKE A ONE CLARIFYING. ISSUES STATED THAT. THESE PRISON. OF THAT HAPPENED. CLEARLY IN THE PRESENCE OF OTHER- IT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE. THEY COULD TESTIFY WHAT THEY SEE BUT NOT WHAT THEY HEAR. THAT'S MY CLARITY. I GUESS WE SHOULD ASK FOR ONE OF THE ATTORNEYS TO CLARIFY BECAUSE I THINK IF THEY HEAR IT AS A WITNESS IF I SEE A CRIME AND- OR A SENSE TO. THE IN JAIL. I'M GOING TO SHOOT YOU AN EYE WITNESS THAT I CAN TESTIFY THAT BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME INFORMED NOW BY HERE AFTER THE FACT. FOR MY BUDDY. THAT SOMEONE ELSE DID IT THEN I CAN'T TEST FOR THAT BUT I THINK I JUST HEARD WHAT I HEARD TO AS A WITNESS SHOW. UP MISTREATMENT THAT IS NOT. UNDER WE USE THE DEFINITION. AS DEFINED IN LAW I AM. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF OUR TOWN IS CORRECT BUT I'M HAPPY TO HELP ONE OF OUR- LAWYERS ARE. LAWYERS WITNESSES- WHO'S AN EXPERT IN THIS ARE. SURE TO GET THERE. THEY CAN MAKE IT. VERY STILL ON A COULD MAKE A QUICK. CLARIFICATION OTHERWISE. IF WE IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A- LAWYER DEBATE WILL BE HERE TILL. THE END OF TIME OF. IT WILL AS THOUGH FROM INNOCENCE AGAIN ACROSS NOT TO BY AN LAWYER LEAD BY- WE DELAY. TO DEFINE LANGUAGE INCOME AND FOR IS ON OF EXIT LAW IN POK SECTION ELEVEN SEVEN EIGHT. AND ELEVEN ELEVEN POINT FIVE WHICH HAD BEEN REST REFERENCED BY SEVERAL OF THEM THE OPPOSITION THAT ARE EXISTING LAW WE ARE NOT CHANGING THE DEFINITION OF THE DEPARTMENT FOR THAT LOOK AT THE- J. THIS WICKS YOU HAD A QUESTION. I'LL KEEP IT VERY BRIEF I JUST WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR THE BILL I WOULD LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR LOOKING FOR SUPPORTING IT. THANK YOU. AND I'M OF THE BILL. RIGHT OKAY WE HAVE A SECOND MISSILE MISTER CLARK SO. FAR DAVID. THERE ARE HUNDREDS REASONS OKAY AND WHAT ISN'T SIGN. SORRY BEN FRANKLIN SAID IT IS BETTER ONE GUILTY PERSON SHOULD GAME THAN ONE INNOCENT PERSON SHOULD SUFFER. I REALLY DON'T. THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A HUNDRED TO ONE BUT I'D SUPPORT THAT AND- I'D ALSO LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR CLARK. DO WE HAVE ANYONE ELSE WITH ANY COMMENT. YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS A FEW OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IF YOU DON'T MIND MISTER CHAIR SURE ONE OF THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION COMPARED THIS WITNESS TO I. TO I. WITNESS TESTIMONY BEING AN ACCURATE NOW WILL BE LEARNING MORE MORE ABOUT HOW I WITNESS TESTIMONY CAN BE INACCURATE BUT I THINK THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE OF SOMEBODY WHO MAKES A MISTAKE. FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS AND SOMEBODY WHO HAS A BUILT IN A BIAS ARE AN INCENTIVE TO LIE OR TO PRETEND THEY HAVE INFORMATION THAT THEY DON'T AND I THINK WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WITH THIS AND THAT EVEN THOUGH WE'VE KNOWN ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS FOR MANY MANY YEARS WE KEEP SEEING THESE EGREGIOUS EXAMPLES OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND AS- MY- COLLEAGUES- FROM SANTA CLARA. OF SOMEWHERE IN SOMEONE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF OUR QUE HAN SAID AND IT WAS I MEAN I WISH SHE HAD GIVEN THE TESTIMONY SHE SPOKE SO POWERFULLY IN SO WELL THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG I AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT IF WE HAD A TEST THAT WAS WE WERE RELYING ON TO CONVICT PEOPLE THAT HAD A ALLOWED IN THE COURTROOM- I WILL SAY THAT I AM GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION I THINK THAT YOU KNOW IF THERE ARE VALID CONCERNS WE WANT TO ADDRESS THEM. AND WE ARE VERY OPEN WE WE'VE HAD PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE SOME OF THEM HAVE COME TO US AND SAID THIS IS A PROBLEM WOULD LIKE BETTER PARAMETERS IF THEY COME TO US AND GIVE US TWO EXAMPLES WHERE THEY REALLY NEED SOMETHING AS A TOOL AND THEY FEEL THAT THEY CAN REALLY SHOW THAT- THEY CAN HAVE SAFEGUARDS WE ARE OPEN TO THAT CONVERSATION WE KNOW THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT VOTE ON THE FLOOR WE WANT TO MAKE THIS PROTECTIVE BUT ALSO TO NOT TAKE AWAY TOOLS. THAT CAN BE USED WELL SO WE ARE OPEN TO HAVING THAT CONVERSATION OPEN TO STRENGTHENING THE LANGUAGE AROUND PEOPLE WHO WITNESS CRIMES WITHIN THE PRISON SETTING IF THAT'S A CONCERN THAT IT TO A BIGGER AS WE CAN I'M SURE ADD LANGUAGE ABOUT THAT AS WELL SO THIS IS GOING TO BE A WORK IN PROGRESS I WOULD- YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT I HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD AND HAVING THIS CONVERSATION THE THING THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE TO ME IS TO NOT. HAVE THIS MOVE- YOU KNOW HERE OR OFF THE FOR THE LEGISLATURE THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE DOING HARD TIME BECAUSE OF WITNESSES THAT WE KNOW ARE UNRELIABLE WITNESSES THAT WE KNOW ARE LIARS AND WE ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN FOR TOO LONG NOT TO MENTION THE CONSTITUTIONALITY ISSUES OF NOT GIVING PEOPLE MIRANDA WARNINGS WHEN CERTAIN TYPES OF INFORMANTS ARE USED WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU FOR BEING USED FOR LIKE I REMEMBER WHEN THE INCIDENT HAPPENED ORANGE COUNTY AND I WAS PREPARED TO BRING GATE A BILL VERY SIMILAR TO THIS SITE- TO PERKINS. PART WAS THE ONE THAT MADE IT. EVEN DIFFICULT FOR ME- TO MOVE FORWARD SO I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE MAKING A VALIANT EFFORT TO THREAD THE NEEDLE. BECAUSE I TO JUST LIKE YOU. DO NOT WANT TO HAMPER LAW ENFORCEMENT'S. INABILITY TO. GET PEOPLE WHO'VE COMMITTED CRIMES AND- TO MAKE SURE THEY- FIGURE PROSECUTORS SO I COMMEND YOU AND I HOPE THAT. LAW ENFORCEMENT TAKE YOU UP ON YOUR- YOUR OFFER. TO BUT I'M USED TO WORK THREAD THE NEEDLE SO THAT THEY CAN GET THEIR WORK DONE BUT ALSO MAKE SURE. THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO USE THIS. IN THE WRONG WAY. WE CAN MAKE SURE THEY DON'T USE THIS AS A HAMMER AGAINST ANYONE SO. I WOULD JUST RECOMMEND AND I BOTH. I'M EIGHTY SIX SEVENTY NINE BY SOME MEMBER FRIEDMAN THE MISSION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. CHEN SO YOUR IRAQI YES OR GOOD ISSUED JUST TOO STRONGNOPE LACKEY NO BARRICADE CAN. BARRICADE HAD AYE COURT. COURT FIGHTS SANTIAGO C. R. TO C. R. TURNOUT WICKS WICKS I LI LI I. THANK YOU VERY JUST. AND THE EFFORTS OF FIRING. ANY EFFORTS OF CLARITY AND ESPECIALLY SINCE IT'S MY BILL- I MEANT TO SAY A. B. TWO FIVE FOUR JONES SAWYER IS ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR AND I BELIEVE PEOPLE HEARD ME SAY TWO FIVE TWO. SO THAT IS A CORRECTION ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR. MR GABRIEL I DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE- I MISSED YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL ORANGE TIE. HE. WHEN EVER YOU READY YOU CAN BEGIN YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE HEARING YOUR ORANGE TIE FOR GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION AT THE- WELCOME. SUPPORT I WANT TO THANK YOU AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE STAFF FOR. THEIR THOUGHTFUL FEEDBACK ON THE BILL. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION HAS BEEN A TOP PART OF MINE SINCE I CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE I'VE BEEN REALLY PRIVILEGE TO WORK WITH. A NUMBER OF FOLKS ON THIS COMMITTEE HAVE BEEN REAL LEADERS IN THAT SPACE. AND THAT TODAY'S BILL DEALS WITH- AN ELEMENT OF GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION CALLED MICRO STAMPING. THIS IS BASICALLY A SIMPLE RELIABLE. GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND CRIME SOLVING TOOL. THAT IMPRINTS. AS MICROSCOPIC CHARACTERS ON A CARTRIDGE CASING THINK OF IT AS A LICENSE PLATE FOR A BONE. MY CRISTINA THING IS BEEN THE LAW IN CALIFORNIA SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. UNSAFE HANDGUN ACT REQUIRES NEW SEMI AUTOMATIC HANDGUNS INCORPORATE MICROCHIPPING TECHNOLOGY. SUPPORTING THE GUN INDUSTRY HAS EFFECTIVELY BOYCOTTED THE LAW. BY BY REFUSING TO DEVELOP NEW HANDGUN MODELS FOR SALE CALIFORNIA. AND SO THIS BILL SEEKS TO CHANGE THE EQUATION BY REQUIRING FIREARMS USED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO BE EQUIPPED WITH MICROSCOPIC TECHNOLOGY NOW ALLOWS CALIFORNIA TO LEAD WITH OUR VALUES IN A WAY. THAT HAS BROUGHT PUBLIC BENEFITS. AND AS I SEE THERE ARE THREE BENEFITS TO THIS APPROACH. THE FIRST IS THAT WE'RE GONNA CREATE NEW MARKETS FOR MY CRISTINA GUNS WE HAVE EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND. ACTIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN CALIFORNIA. COMPANIES GOING TO BE ABLE TO WANNA BE ABLE TO SELL INTO THAT MARKET. IS WE'RE GONNA ABLE TO USE. MARKET POWER TO DRIVE GOOD POLICY. BUT IS EVER GOING TO SAY. ARE GOING HELP LAUNCH. SO VIOLENT. MICROGAMING ALLOWS POLICE TO IDENTIFY A SHOOTER WITHOUT EVER PHYSICALLY RECOVERING A GUN. CURRENTLY 70% OF AGGRAVATED ASSAULT WITH A- FIREARM GO UNSOLD. AND SO THIS IS GOING TO HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT TO SOLVE NONFATAL SHOOTINGS. INTERRUPT CYCLES OF VIOLENCE THAT WE TALK ABOUT. AND IT'S GOING TO HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT IDENTIFY AND CRACK DOWN ON FIREARM TRAFFICKING. AND THE THIRD IS IT'S GOING TO CREATE MORE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY IN SITUATIONS WHERE THERE HAS BEEN AN OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING. IN A WAY THAT IS GOING TO HELP BUILD COMMUNITY TRUST. THIS IS TECHNOLOGY THAT IS UNOBTRUSIVE OBJECTIVES AND IMPORTANTLY NOT PRONE TO RACIAL BIAS. AND CONSISTENT WITH OUR EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE MEANINGFUL POLICE REFORM. I WANT TO PREEMPTIVELY ADDRESS SOME OF THE- OBJECTIONS TO THE BILL- YOU KNOW QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THIS TECHNOLOGY IS RELIABLE. AND EXPENSIVE I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS CERTIFIED THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY WORKS. THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN ADMITTED IN COURT ADMITTED IN LITIGATION THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT MICROSCOPIC TECHNOLOGIES. I KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT IN A FISCAL COMMITTEE BUT IT BEARS ON. THE QUESTION OF BURDEN THE ESTIMATED COST FOR MICROSCOPIC A FIREARM THE LOWEST ESTIMATE I'VE HEARD IS FIFTY CENTS PER FIREARMS. THE HIGHEST AS MY PART IS SIX DOLLARS PER PHONE. SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE BURDEN THAT WE'RE GONNA POST ON HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A TOTAL TOTAL COST. OF SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FORTY FIVE THOUSAND. AT THE LOW END 255-002-0000 AT THE HIGH END AND THAT'S TO DO EVERYONE THAT'S TO DO A WEAPON FOR EVERY SINGLE OFFICE CERTAIN. SHOULD THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SENATE SAID WERE EAGER TAKING TO OUR TO. WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT OF. WE ARE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE FULL AN ROBUST CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM. BUT THEY HAVE BEEN KEY PARTNERS THE LEGISLATURE IN ADVANCING PRIOR PREVIOUS MICROSCOPIC EFFORTS. AND WE'RE PROUD THAT OUR BILL SUPPORTED BY. A BROAD COALITION OF GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION GROUPS INCLUDING THE BRADY CAMPAIGN. MARCH FOR OUR LIVES AND WOMEN AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY ARE STEVEN ABRAMS FOR KEEPING HIM ENOUGH. AND JOSH FOR WITH FROM THE COALITION FOR GUN TO STOP GUN VIOLENCE THANK YOU AND WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SIR IN GENERAL AND WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. AGAIN. HI MY NAME IS STEPHANIE BROWN AND I'M A HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR FROM SAN DIEGO AND I'M THE NATIONAL GRASSROOTS AND PROGRAM LEAD. A TEAM MADE UP WHICH IS THE U. S. BRANCH OF BRADY. I THINK ASSEMBLYMEMBERS GABRIEL AND MANY PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY. FOR A YOUNG PERSON LIKE MYSELF TO REVISED TESTIMONY. ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION. MICROCHIPPING IS A LONG CALIFORNIA- IT IS LONG CALIFORNIA IN THE TECHNOLOGY WILL REVOLUTIONIZE MON PORTSMOUTH ABILITY TO IDENTIFY SHOOTERS. AND GUN TRAFFICKERS APPREHEND THEM BEFORE THEY DO MORE. ARMS AND HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. NOW THE DENTIST HAS A FIVE PUT CARD WITH THE BY WITH. TO NEW HANG THEM FOR SO HELP. AND TWO THAT THEY MY- DOWNTURN AVAILABLE TOP. MICROCHIPPING WOULD FAIL BUT NOT THE SYSTEM THE BETTER FOR TOO LONG PORT. UNABLE TO FALL TO BUY FIRE. I NEED A MOTHER EVERY TO TELL ME HOW THEY HOPE THAT MILITARY HAVE TO ENTER. KNOWING THEIR CHILD KILLERS OUT THERE OR KNOWING THER FAMILY WILL NEVER RECEIVE JUSTICE. BY MANDATING THE MONTFORT AND DOES HAVE MAKERS AND THE TECHNOLOGY. AB EIGHT THAT'LL TAKE FOR CREATE A LAN PORT ENTRANCE FANCY ANSWER CALIFORNIA'S OFFICERS ALSO MEET ON FIRE IN THE BATHROOM AND SET THE STAGE. FOR WIDESPREAD AND MICROSCOPIC. I WANTED MORE THAN EVER THIS BILL WILL ACCOUNTABILITY IN TRANSPARENCY AND SHALL WE HAVE TIMELY WAS. IN ANY POLICE BOB AND SHOOTING. THERE'S NO. WHY THOSE WHO TRIED TO PROTECT THAT WOULD BE EXAMPLE TECHNOLOGIES WILL ONLY HELP MAKE OUR COMMUNITY SAFER. AND IMPORTANTLY POINTS CARE THEMBEKA STAND GUNS ARE CONTINUES FOR SELLING. IN THE WHOLE WIDE BY PROVIDING DENTISTRY WITH A STRONGER FINANCIAL INCENTIVES. THIS BILL ALLOWED ENFORCEMENT WE ONLY BE ON BY. IT ISSUE WHERE NOT LOOK AT THOSE UPHOLD LAW FOR EXAMPLE FM. THANK YOU PROPER THING UNDER THAT THE MARKET TECHNO WHY ONE POINT FOUR ONE FOURTH NOT BE EXEMPT. THE LEGALLY FINE HOW THE- CONTRIBUTE CAN THANK. AND MAKING OUR SAFER I'M A PROUD CALIFORNIA IN THE HOPE FOR THE WE WILL MAINLY BE. IN DOWN BALLOT CONVENTION AND INTENSE CAN'T. IN ACCOUNT IMPAR. THE BILL. BOTH IF I URGE YOU TO FOR THE FELT. THANK NEXT. MY IS JOSH FOR WHAT I'M THE GUY DIRECT OF THE COAL TO STOP GUN VIOLENCE THANK YOU TO BE COMMITTEE IN THE CHARM FLOODING PACKED UP TODAY I WANT TO GO FROM PRO THIRTY YEARS OR MORE ON MY PERCENT CALIFORNIA THE TWO THOUSAND FIVE. I RECENTLY REVIEWED THE STATE OF MICROSEISMIC TECHNOLOGY FOR PORTO'S PUBLISHING FEBRUARY ENTITLED BY KRISTIN BEING COLLEGE HELPS ALL GUN CRIMES IDENTIFIED GUN TRAFFICKING NETWORKS REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE I'M HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT. AB EIGHT SEVEN FAX. THE BILL REQUIRES ITS OR NOT PISTOL ARE PERCHED USE BY LAW AFTER JULY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE BECAUSE MY PERCENT THE TECHNOLOGY. THAT WILL INCREASE LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY BY ENSURING THAT WE HAVE TIMELY RESULTS IN ANY OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS THE BILL ALSO GIVES LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THE CHANCE TO LEAD THE STATE. I'D SAY FOR FARMS TECHNOLOGY. MY PERSPECTIVE LIKE A LICENSE PLATE PER CARTRIDGE TASTES THE CREATING EIGHT DIGIT CODE ON THE BACK OF EVERY EXPAND THE CARTRIDGE CASE. WILL BARNES ARE MANUFACTURED TOOL MARKS ARE LEFT ON THE FARM AND IN OTHER LOCATIONS ON THE FIREARM. WITH A GUN IS FIRED THE ONLY PENCIL TOOL MARKS IN GRADE THE BACK OF A CARTRIDGE. UNINTENTIONAL MARKS OR FARMS EXAMINERS REVIEW WHEN TRYING TO MATCH A CARTRIDGE TO A GUN. ALL MY CRYSTAL BINGO- THE TAKE THOSE SAME FORCES ORGANIZED IN A WAY THEY CREATE INTENTIONAL. THE DISCHARGE THE CARTRIDGE MATTRESS MICROSECOND HELPS IDENTIFY ILLEGAL TRAFFICKING CHANNELS IT'S ALL CROXALL CRIMES. THESE MARKS ARE HIGHLY ACCURATE WITH CURRENT TECHNOLOGY ALLOWING EIGHT CHARACTERS COULD BE THAT GREATER THAN 97% OF THE CAUGHT. THE GUN CAN PRODUCE STABLE MARKS WITHOUT THE THOUSANDS OF BROWN'S IT WILL NOT INCREASE. THE CHANCES OF THE FIREARM ON HEALTH. THE TECHNOLOGY CERTIFIED BY THIS ON A COMPARABLE AND INCOME. ANY POWER RESEARCH. IT COMMERCIALLY AVAIL TO BOTH MANAGE. AND MAJOR JOBS. THE TECHNOLOGY I CAN IS ECONOMIC COSTING BETWEEN SO AND FIVE DOLLAR PER GUY. FINALLY THIS IS GLAZER MARKING THE SAME TECH THE USED IN MANY OTHER FIELDS AND WHILE MAY IT'S BEACH. IN REALITY IT IS CALM AND THE IT DOES APPLICATIONS THE TIME FOR MY PERCENT IS NOW THANK YOU.

FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION. YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CORY CELLS L. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION. TO EIGHTY EIGHT SEVENTY SIX THIS BILL INDEPENDENT OF THE POLICY IT SEEKS TO ACHIEVE WILL RESULT IN COSTLY AND BURDENSOME MANDATES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND INCLUDES NO FUNDING. MANDATE APPLIES TO ALL AGENCIES WHEN THEY ACQUIRE NEW HANDGUNS IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THE AGENCY IS BUYING MANY HANDGUNS OR ONLY A FEW WHETHER HANDGUNS HAD RECENTLY BEEN REPLACED. OR HAVE BEEN IN SERVICE FOR SOME TIME. THE BILL ALSO IGNORES THE REALITY THAT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FIREARM IS NOT ONLY CRUCIAL TO THE AGENCY. BUT DIFFERENT PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS MAY BE FAVORED BY SOME AGENCIES OVER OTHERS. THIS IS IMPORTANT WHEN CONSIDERING WHETHER SUFFICIENT CHOICE WILL EXIST IN THE MARKET BY THE TIME THE BILL TAKES EFFECT. EVEN IF THERE ARE THIS UNFUNDED OBLIGATION WILL CREATE UNNECESSARY OR UNNECESSARILY CREATE BECAUSE- THAT WILL BE SOLD BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WIRING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DO SOMETHING SHOULD NOT BE USED AS AN ATTEMPT TO DRIVE MARKETS FOR INDUSTRIES. RESPECTFULLY FOR THE REASONS STATED CSSA MUST OPPOSE AB EIGHT SEVEN SIX WE CONTINUE TO HOPE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE. ANYONE IN THE ROOM IN OPPOSITION.

THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO MAKE A COMMENT IN OPPOSITION OF AB EIGHT SEVEN SIX PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONCE AGAIN FOR OPPOSITION OF EIGHTY EIGHT SEVEN SIX TO PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. I CURRENTLY HAVE TWO COMMENTS THANK YOU IT'LL JUST BE ONE MOMENT FOR THE FIRST COMMENT. AND ONE SIXTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI MY NAME IS ANTHONY MENDOZA FROM FREMONT CALIFORNIA AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT ONE SIXTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. NINE ONE SIX NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU NUMBER BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND QUESTIONS MISTER CORK. SO FIRST I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT A REVOLVERS AND PISTOLS. SO JUST I ONLY FIGURED THIS OUT BECAUSE I HAD TO BRIBE VOTE ON THIS BILL I'M NOT VERY FAMILIAR WITH GUNS BUT- A PISTOL IS OFTEN REFERRED TO A SEMI AUTOMATIC IT HAS A MAGAZINE YOU CAN PULL AND- PUSH AND YOU CAN GET A LOT OF SHOTS OFF. A REVOLVER HAS A CHAMBER THAT REVOLVES AND HAS. FIVE SIX SOMETIMES SEVEN SHOTS. WHY ARE YOU NOT- LOOKING AT ME TO- ALSO- REQUIRE- REVOLVERS- TO- BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STAMPING AND HOW MANY DO YOU NOTICE LAW ENFORCEMENT USE ONE OR THE OTHER. IF YOU COULD ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS YEAH AND ALL ALL ASK MY ONE OF MY WITNESSES TRANSFORMATIVE HE WANTS TO JUMP IN HERE BUT REVOLVERS HAVE BEEN EXEMPT FROM THE- UNSAFE CAN'T ACT WE'RE JUST FOLLOWING WHAT'S CURRENTLY. IN THE LAWS WERE UPDATED TO MY KNOWLEDGE. VERY FEW OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE USING REVOLVERS BUT NOW I'M OFF WINDOWS TO GET ANYTHING HE WANTS TO ADD. I WOULD THIS IS JOSH FOR WHAT I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT WILL BE. TO DON'T- DON'T THROW OUT SHALL. SO WHEN YOU FIRE SOME. PISTOL THEY JACK SHELKE IN- BUT TO THE STATE WILL FALL THOSE WITH THEM IN THE CHOI. OF CHU BURKE THE TO BE DON'T HAVE- MUCH BECAUSE- JUST. RAW THE CRIMES. I'M SORRY THAT'S OUR- UP ON AUTOMATIC PISTOL THE- WITH THE FACT- IS. SPONSORED NINETY THAT- WILL. ARE THESE RALLY CALL CARD BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. GUN MANUFACTURERS DON'T WANT TO COMPLY WITH THIS OBLIGATION AND AS FAR AS I CAN TELL IT'S MORE IDEOLOGICAL THAN ANYTHING ELSE AND SO THIS IS GOING TO CREATE MARKET INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO COMPLY WITH IT. BUT BUT WHY OF THE IDEOLOGICALLY OPPOSED TO THEY DON'T WANT. THEIR CUSTOMERS TO THE- TO. BE FOUND OUT WHEN THEY COMMIT CRIMES IS THAT THE IDEOLOGY OR WHAT IS IT YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW YOU YOU'D HAVE TO. YOU'D YOU'D YOU KNOW YOU'D HAVE TO ASK THEM DIRECTLY I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR THEM I THINK OKAY HAVE HAVE THE MANUFACTURERS HAVE GENERALLY BEEN BEEN RESISTANT TO- TO ANY TYPE OF REGULATION. AND SO I THINK IT HAS MORE TO DO WITH THAT THAN ANYTHING ELSE BUT AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR THEM. OUR GUN USERS I KNOW IN SOME CASES- THEY ACTUALLY DO NOT WANT- THIS TECHNOLOGY OUT OF HAVE GUN USERS YOUR GUN USER GROUPS EVER TAKEN A POSITION ON THIS. SO FAR AS AS AS FAR AS I CAN TELL NO NOT. NO NOT NONE OF THOSE GROUPS HAVE WEIGHED IN ON OUR FOR NINE- AGAIN THIS IS REALLY TARGETING LONG FOR RIGHT NOW- I WOULD HAVE TO FOR THAT YOU KNOW CHRIS CERTAIN WANT WANT CRISTINA PROTECT- BUT I'M NOT WHY ALLOW GONNA WOULD BE CONCERNED IT. OKAY SO WHAT HAPPENED IF. JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE COMES BALLOT AND NOBODY HAS- PUT OUT SOMETHING. WHAT'S THE FALL BACK WITH SO THE FALL BACK THERE IS THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY TAKE THE WEAPONS THAT THEY HAVE AND GO GET THE FIRING PIN ENGRAVED FOR pFIRING TEN THAT HAS BEEN AT LEAST ARE GREAT SO IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO ONLY HAVE THE OPTION TO GO OUT THERE BY THERE AND THAT'S WHY. I THINK THE ARGUMENT WE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT IT WOULD LIMIT THE CHOICES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR WHICH TYPE OF WEAPONS THEY CAN USE I DON'T ACTUALLY SEE HOW THAT MANIFESTS ITSELF IN REALITY BECAUSE LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN PURCHASE ANY TYPE OF WEAPON THAT IT WANTS AND THEN GET THE FIRING PENDING GREAT AFTER THE FACT RIGHT AND THEN THEY'RE OFF. ANY WEAPON THEY CARRY OFF DUTY IS NOT REQUIRED TO CORRECT CORRECT THIS IS ABOUT WEAPONS PURCHASED BY THE DEPARTMENT OR ANY WEAPON THAT THEY CARRY ON TV OKAY HAS THE BILL BEEN MOVED YET. YES OKAY THANK YOU FOR IT YES. WICKS THANK YOU CHAIR I JUST WANNA- THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE BILL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK IT'S SMART TECHNOLOGY. WE ARE GRAPPLING WITH HOW TO- NAVIGATE THE GUN VIOLENCE OR SING IN OUR COMMUNITIES I THINK THIS IS. ONE WAY THAT- WE CAN HOPEFULLY. MITIGATE SOME OF THAT AND I. ALSO HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO TALK TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AS THE BILL MOVES TO THE PROCESS. HOPEFULLY BUT- I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT THE BILL LOOKING OR DEVOTING FOR. YEAH THINKING OF IF I MIGHT AS MEDICARE WE HAVE THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION NOTIFIED ME TODAY AS I BELIEVE THEY DID THE COMMITTEE THAT THEY HAVE MOVED FROM OPPOSED TO NEUTRAL- SO WE'RE REALLY. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATIONS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS SUPPORTED PREVIOUS MICROCHIPPING EFFORTS. YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE GET A LITTLE NERVOUS WHENEVER THERE'S ANY TYPE OF NEW REQUIREMENT. BUT IS REALLY MY INTENTION TO WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN ACCOMMODATE. AS MANY OTHER CONCERNS AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE I THINK THEY- MORE THAN ANYONE WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS TECHNOLOGY. RIGHT WILL HELP THEM IN SOLVING CRIMES WE KNOW FROM THE FBI. FOR MY TEN YEAR STUDY THAT 70% OF NON FATAL- AGGRAVATED ASSAULT INVOLVING FIREARMS AREN'T SOLVED SO THIS IS ACTUALLY TOOL THAT'S GOING TO HELP THE GENERAL PUBLIC. AND HEALTH PROBLEMS FOR SOME AS WELL. IT IS THAT YOU'RE CLOSE. LIFE THAT AND- IN TERMS. SO BUT I'M KIND OF STRONG WITH THE BAD GUYS OUT THERE BECAUSE THAT IS A GOOD WE DON'T. DO YOU KNOW MOST OF THE LAW BY CITIZEN WOULD NOT EVER HAVE TO WORRY OF SOMEBODY IDENTIFIABLE THEY WENT THROUGH SOMEBODY CAME FROM THEM- IT'S THE BAD GUYS IS THEY DON'T NECESSARILY BUY THEIR GUNS FROM. FROM HERE NOW BUYING FROM DEALERS. AND THEY BUY AM FROM- OTHER COUNTRIES. AND MAYBE EVEN OTHER STATES- WHAT'S TO PREVENT BAD GUYS FROM CONTINUING THAT PRACTICE WHILE WE IMPOSE MORE COSTS ON. OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES I. E. R. R. CITIES- TO DO SOME WHERE WE ARE KNOW THERE BUT ARE GOING IN WHERE THEY CAME YOU KNOW WHO SHOT THEM. WELL SO I GUESS A CO OF A COUPLE OF RESPOND TO THIS IN TERMS OF THE ANY I KNOW WE'RE NOT IN COULD BY- IF YOU LOOK AT THE CAR THE ESTá COST STATE. HERE AND THEN YOU THINK ABOUT COST OF GUN OF MEDICARE AND OTHER THING TO THE STATE. IF WE PRESENT IF WE PREVENT ONE OR TWO SHOOTING HERE WE ARE PROBABLY THIS IS PROBABLY REVENUE POSITIVE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE ACTUALLY SAVING TAXPAYER MONEY. NOW ON THE ISSUE IN TERMS OF YOUR EITHER THE FIRST PART OF THE QUESTION ABOUT THE FACT THAT CRIMINALS OFTEN ACQUIRE LAW- FIREARMS THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS. IN ANY EVENT WHERE THERE'S MY CRISTINA CAN ACTUALLY HELP TRACE WHERE THE FIRING CAME FROM AND SO THAT'S WHY. THERE'S AN ELEMENT CARE PREVENTING GUN TRAFFICKING WITH RIGHT NOW PEOPLE BUY WEAPONS WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO TRACE THEM BACK. IF THEY'RE MY CHRISTOPHER HELPED US TRACE THAT BACK. IF THEY'RE BUYING THEM FROM A FOREIGN COUNTRY. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THIS BILL CAN ADDRESS THIS BILL ISN'T GONNA SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM IN IN THE ENTIRE WORLD ALL ALL ADMIT THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT THIS BILL CAN'T DEAL- BUT I THINK IT IT WILL ROLL THE BALL FORWARD. ON A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ARE PART TO THE STATE THAT WILL BENEFIT BOTH LAW ABIDING CITIZENS. AND DAM ON FORSMAN. I'M NOT SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND HOW IT PREVENTS A SHOOTING FROM HAPPENING. I UNDERSTAND HOW IT MAY PREVENT. SOMEBODY WHO HAD NO INTENTION OF GOING AND BEING A SHOOTER OF SORTS WHO HAD THEIR GUN MAKERS. MICRO MICROCHIPPED WHATEVER. AND THEN GONE OUT AND- AND GET A SHOOTING. HOW THAT MIGHT HELP HEM CATCH SOMEBODY LIKE THAT SO SERVICE HOW IT PREVENTS THANK YOU THE IDEA HERE IN TERMS IT IS A GREAT QUESTION IT'S A GREAT QUESTION DID YOU HEARD FROM THE PREVENTING SHOOTING. IS A LOT OF THE GUN VIOLENCE THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE IS RETALIATORY VIOLENCE WE SEE THIS IN CERTAIN IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES RIGHT AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS IN PREVIOUS YEARS WE'VE INVESTED HUGE AMOUNT AMOUNTS OF MONEY AND VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PROGRAMS. BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN DATA THAT WE CAN BREAK THAT CYCLE OF RETALIATORY VIOLENCE WE CAN BRING THE OVERALL NUMBER OF SHOOTINGS WAY DOWN. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT GIVES LAW ENFORCEMENT A BETTER LEAD ON WHO COMMITTED A SHOOTING AND THEY CAN GET THAT PERSON THEY CAN BREAK THAT CHAIN OF RETALIATORY VIOLENCE AND HOPEFULLY BRING THE LEVEL OF GUN VIOLENCE DOWN. THANK YOU FOR ANSWERS. ARE THANK YOU UP MR LACKEY A QUESTION YEAH I JUST A COUPLE POINTS OF CLARITY IS IT TRUE THAT- MICROSCOPIC TECHNOLOGY HAS NOT BEEN ADOPTED BY ANY HANDGUN MANUFACTURED TO THIS POINT. THAT THAT'S THAT THAT'S CORRECT AND THIS IS ONE OF THESE AREAS WERE HOPING THAT THAT TECH THAT CALIFORNIA CAN LEAD I THINK THAT THEY'VE- SOUGHT TO EVADE THAT REQUIREMENT BUT AS I AS I MENTIONED I DON'T RECALL- YEAH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER IF YOU'RE IN THE ROOM OR NOT DAVID NEEDED IN COURT FILINGS THAT THEY ARE TECHNICALLY ABLE TO DO THIS BUT IT'S NOT A TECHNICAL PROBLEM FOR THEM TO IMPLEMENT MICROSCOPIC TECHNOLOGY. AND OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL CERTIFIED IN THEY'RE ABLE TO DO IT SO WE HAVE FROM BOTH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SIDE AND THE MANUFACTURER SIDE. THE KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THE TECHNOLOGY. IT'S MY- FRUSTRATION THAT- THE WAY THE BILL AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS WRITTEN TO. WILL LIMIT THE ABILITY FOR PURCHASING- A LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR CERTAIN KIND OF WEAPONS ARE SURE KIND OF WEAPONS. THAT MAY NOT BE. MANUFACTURED BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE'S NONE. AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SAVING MONEY WHO WERE YOU SAVING MONEY FOR BECAUSE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. THAT THIS BILL HAS NO FUNDING MECHANISM. SO IT'S JUST GOING TO COST LAW ENFORCEMENT PART OF THE BUDGET. YEAH AND I AGAIN I THINK- AND I'LL JUST ADDRESSED THE DOCTOR KIRK REYES THE SAME POINT READY TO GO TO WE DON'T WANT TO LIMIT THE RANGE OF OPTIONS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS- WHICH THEY NEED THE TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB. SO IF THERE IS NOT A MODEL OF GUN THAT IS SOLD WITH MICROSCOPIC TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY NEED THEY CAN GO OUT THERE AND BY THAT CATEGORY OF WEAPON AND THEN ENGRAVE THE FIRING TEN WITH MY CRISTINA OR REPLACE THE FIRING PIN WITH A FIRING PIN THAT HAS BEEN MICRO STAMP AT A COST OF SOMEWHERE BETWEEN. FIFTY CENTS AND SIX FIFTY TO REPLACE THAT THAT FIRING HIM SO WE'RE NOT ANYWAY GOING TO LIMIT ANY TYPE OF CATEGORY OF WEAPON THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT COULD USE TO DO THEIR JOB THEY NEED THE TOOLS TO DO THEIR JOB. AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE COST AYE I MENTION THIS I THINK WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF THE ROOM. THE LOWEST ESTIMATE FOR THE COST OF THIS TECHNOLOGY PER WEAPON IS FIFTY CENTS. THE HIGHEST ESTIMATE IS SIX DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS WHEN YOU TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WE HAVE EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND ACTIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TOTAL COST STATEWIDE EVERY OFFICER IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN I GOT TO CHECK MY MATH FORTY FIVE THOUSAND AND FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND FOR THE WHOLE STATE EVERY AGENCY EVERY OFFICER SO. IN MY MIND IF YOU'RE HALF A MILLION BUCKS IS YOUR HIGHER ESTIMATE WE'RE NOT REALLY IMPOSING A HUGE BURDEN ON OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGAIN THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN ADDRESS TO THE BUDGET FOR A PROBLEMS I WAS HOPING TO SPEAK TO A POLICY IN THIS COMMITTEE. BUT I THINK THIS IDEA OF COST AND BURDEN HERE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY DO THE MATH. IT'S DE MINIMUS. IN MY OPINION THERE'S TOO MUCH- FOR SOME THE SOAP. IN THE DEFENSE OF- LAW ENFORCEMENT SO I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE STUDENTS ARE. MR LEE. I JUST I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR ALSO BRING THIS FOURTEEN YEAR LEADERSHIP IN THEIR THOROUGHNESS IN THIS ISSUE AREA ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT HOW FORWARD THINKING IT IS OBVIOUSLY THEY JUST RECENTLY TO CATCH UP TO THIS BUT IT COULD BRING GREAT TRANSPARENCY IN ESPECIALLY THE ISSUE OF POLICE INVOLVED SHOOTINGS BECAUSE UP UNTIL NOW WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO SHOT WHICH BILL UNTIL THIS BALLISTIC TESTS BUT MICROGAMING WHO CAN TELL CONFIDENCE WHO FIRED WHAT SHOT AND THAT GIVES A LOT OF TRANSPARENCY KNOWS THE PUBLIC BUT TO THE POLICE FAR WHEN TAKING APPROPRIATE ACTION ABOUT. WHAT CAN HAPPEN BUT INCIDENTS HAPPEN OF COURSE WE HAD ANOTHER DRAMATIC SHOOTING JUST THIS WEEKEND- IN IN A SUBURB NORTH OF MINNEAPOLIS AND IT WOULD BE REALLY BORED TO KNOW OBVIOUSLY IN ALL THESE KIND OF CASES WHO FIRED ONE SHOT AND HAVE DEFINITIVE INSIDE CASE IT'S A REALLY HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND- THANK YOU FOR YEAH I KNOW I APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST- TO ME ONE OF THE BIGGEST AT A YOU KNOW ATTRACTIONS OF THIS AND BENEFITS OF THIS TECHNOLOGY AS YOU CAN TELL WITHIN A NUMBER OF HOURS. EXACTLY WHO FIRED WEBSITE WHERE IT WENT THERE'S NO IN AND NOT THAT TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY I THINK IT'S GOING TO HELP BUILD TRUST BETWEEN- BETWEEN COMMUNITIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. THANK YOU. IS YOU'RE CLOSE. YES SIR. OKAY AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS AND ALSO THANK YOU FOR ANSWERINGMY QUESTION ON. ON MICROTIA STAMPING RETROACTIVELY. AND WHAT WILL LAW ENFORCEMENT DO IF THEY BUY GUNS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN FROM. MICROSOFT SITE. I APPRECIATE THAT I NOTICED IT. IS TOUGH QUESTION BUT YOU TACKLE RITUALS. THANK YOU. AND SO- OUGHT. AND I'M HAPPY HERE TO RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S. ASSOCIATION HAS GONE NEUTRAL AS YOU KNOW I WAS NEUTRAL AND ON UNDER ADVISEMENT I'M A VOTE I FOR THE- FOR THE BILL NOW. AB EIGHT SEVEN SIX BY SEVEN MEMBER GABRIEL THE MISSION IS TO PASS THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER HI LACKEY NO LACKING NO BARRICADE CAN. THERAPY HAD AYE CORK AYE QUICK AYE SANTIAGO. C. R. TOKEN C. R. TEN NO WICKS. WICKS I'D LI. LI I. THE MEASURE PASS THANK YOU FOR THANK. WE NOW HAVE MR GIVES AB FOUR NINE ZERO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY POLICIES ARREST POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA. AND I BELIEVE MISSION THERE BONTA AG ELECT OR AG. NOMINEE IS ALSO SPEAKING. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS FIRST OF ALL LET ME START OFF BY ACCEPTING THE- COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH MY TEAM IN ORDER TO MAKING AND STRENGTHENING THIS BILL AND WITH CLARIFICATION. WHAT IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR NINETY. WE'RE SIX THE BAD LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM USING RESTRAINTS. RESTRAINTS THAT CALLS POSITIONAL ASPHYXIATION. POSITIONAL EXPIATION. IS A DEADLY CONDITION THAT CAN OCCUR WHEN A PERSON'S BEING RESTRAINED. CANNOT GET ENOUGH OXYGEN I CAN'T BREATHE. WHILE LAW ENFORCEMENT INTENDS TO INCAPACITATE OR RENDER A SUSPECT UNCONSCIOUS WE ALREADY KNOW THAT CHAU COLES AND CAROTID ARTERY STRAINS ARE DANGEROUS AND OFTEN LETHAL. LAST YEAR AFTER A HIGH PROFILE DEATH OF MR GEORGE FLOYD BY LAW ENFORCEMENT IN MINNEAPOLIS CIVIL UNREST TOOK PLACE ALL OVER THE NATION AND INTERNATIONALLY. RESPONDING TO THE COMMUNITY WITHOUT WASTING ANY TIME I AUTHORS LANDMARK LEGISLATION ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN NINETY SIX. TOBAM LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM USING PRODUCT SKEWS ME CHUCKLES AND THANK THIS COMMITTEE. AND THE CHAIR FOR SUPPORTING THIS VITAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT I COULD NOT HAVE DONE IT MYSELF AND WITHOUT YOU SHORTLY AFTER ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN NINETY SIX WAS INTRODUCED GOVERNOR EXPRESSED SUPPORT IMMEDIATELY. BECAUSE HE SAW THE IMMEDIATE NEED FOR CHANGE I WANT TO THANK OUR GOVERNOR FOR SIGNING ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN NINETY SIX INTO LAW. WE NOW NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL METHODS OF RESTRAINING SOMEONE DO NOT TURN UNNECESSARILY DANGEROUS. THE TECHNIQUES USED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT ON MISTER FLOYD WAS A NEED TO THE NECK RESTRAINT IS ALSO COVERED BY THE LARGER TERM POSITION OF EXPIATION. THEY NEED TO THE NECK BECAUSE OXYGEN TO BE RESTRICTED OR TO STOP THAT RENDER SOMEONE UNCONSCIOUS LEADS TO DEATH. AGAIN THE TERM INCLUDES. OTHER WAYS WHICH LAW ENFORCEMENT RESTRAINTS SOMEONE AND CAUSE THEM TO LOSE OXYGEN BEYOND JUST THE CHOKO CHOKO CAUSES THE BLOOD TO BE RESTRICTED TO THE BRAIN. WHICH CALLS ONE UNCONSCIOUSNESS AND INTO IT LEADS TO DEATH WHEN APPLIED INCORRECTLY. AND FOR TOO LONG. IF A PERSON SOME IF A POSITION IF YOU POSITION SOMEONE. OWN BODY IN A WAY THAT THEY LOSE OXYGEN THIS IS ALSO COVERED BY THIS BILL I WANT TO REPEAT IS COVERED BY THIS BILL. AS WE ALL KNOW THAT OFFICER I WILL SAY IS NINE. PUT ANY OLD MR FLOYD'S NECK. AND HE DID SO FOR NINE MINUTES AND TWENTY NINE SECONDS NINE MINUTES AND TWENTY NINE SECONDS. UNTIL MR FLOORED LAID HIS BODY LAID LIFELESS. IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR ANGELO PINTO. A NAVY VETERAN FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WAS TRAGICALLY KILLED BY THE POLICE. MR KATO WITH HAND CUFFED. MR KANTOR WILL SUFFER A MENTAL HEALTH EPISODE WHERE HIS FAMILY CALLED THE POLICE.

A LOOPHOLE IN THE USE OF FORCE POLICY KERN STATEWIDE USE OF FORCE POLICIES NOW PROHIBIT LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM USING ANY TYPE OF CHOKEHOLD INCLUDING CAROTID ARTERY STRINGS. BUT IT DOES NOT DIRECTLY ADDRESS LISTEN IF IT DOES NOT DIRECTLY ADDRESS USING PERSONAL BODY AS A WEAPON. THAT REDUCE ONE ABILITY TO BRIEF THIS DOES NOT MEAN A POLICE OFFICER CAN NOT CAN NO LONGER RESTRAIN ANYONE THEY NEED TO PLEASE LET ME REPEAT THIS AGAIN. IT DOES NOT PROHIBIT LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM USING A RESTRAINT. WHEN NEEDED. THIS BILL DOES HOWEVER. MAKE SURE THAT POLICE OFFICERS DID NOT USE ANY METHOD THAT CUTS OFF ONE'S BREATHING. RESTRICTS OXYGEN FOR A PERSON LOANS BEING FILLED UP AB FOUR NINETY WILL CREATE A UNIFORM STATEWIDE POLICY ON RESTRAINTS THAT CALLS POSITIONAL ASPHYXIATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE RESTRAINTS ARE NO LONGER USE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES AND STAFF AND I THANK YOU SOME OF EVER GIPSON FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL AND ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME PRESENTED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR ACCOMMODATING ME IN THIS UNUSUAL CALL PRESENTATION- LAST YEAR I WAS PROUD. TO CO AUTHOR. AB ELEVEN NINETY SIX BY SEPTEMBER GIPSON TO BAN THE USE OF CAROTID HOLDS AND RESTRAINTS IT WAS. TIMELY AND NEEDED LANDMARK LEGISLATION FOLLOWING THE TRAGIC DEATH OF GEORGE FLOYD AND THIS YEAR. I'M PROUD TO JOIN AUTHOR A BEFORE NINETY TO BAN THE USE OF POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA RESTRAINTS STATEWIDE. BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. AS MENTIONED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON THIS BILL IS NAMED FOR ANGELA CAN TELL. A YOUNG MAN AND VETERANS WHO LIVE NOT TOO FAR FROM MY DISTRICT AND DIED DURING AN INTERACTION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. I WAS ABLE TO SPEAK TO ANGELES FAMILY IN RECENT WEEKS AND YOU'LL HEAR FROM THEM AS WELL. HIS FAMILY LIT UP WITH STORIES OF A SWEET. AND CURIOUS CHILD WHO GREW INTO A NURTURING AND SENSITIVE MAP. ANGELO LIKE SO MANY OF US HAD STRUGGLED PERIODICALLY WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. INSTEAD OF HELPING HIM IN A MOMENT OF CRISIS. OUR SOCIETY FAILED HIM. I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE MEMBER GIBSON'S LEADERSHIP IN INTRODUCING THIS BILL AND FOR NAMING IT. AFTER AND LOOKING DOWN IN HIS LOVING MEMORY SO THAT WE DO NOT HAVE ADDITIONAL DEATHS LIKE ANGELO'S AND OUR STATE. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU SIR. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES WITHIN THE- ANY WITNESSES. DID YOU HAVE YEAH YES YOU COULD BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WE WERE GIPSON TIMER BONTA MY NAME'S RYAN HARRISON I AM THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF BLACK LAWYERS WE REPRESENT. OVER SIX THOUSAND AFRICAN AMERICAN ATTORNEYS JUDGES LAW PROFESSORS AND STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I ALSO HAPPEN TO BE A FORMER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER AND HOLD A MASTER'S DEGREE IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE. SO I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE ON TESTIMONY- REGARDING THAT TECHNICAL ASPECT OF THE BILL AB ELEVEN NINETY SIX. AND I'M GONNA MAKE THIS REALLY SHORT AND BRIEF BECAUSE THE BILL IS. PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND I'M ALSO AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAY HAVE. I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT THIS BILL IS THIS AMENDMENT- PRETTY MUCH- PROHIBITS LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FROM AUTHORIZING TECHNIQUES OR TRANSPORT METHOD THAT CALLS A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA. SO THE KEY WORD IS SUBSTANTIAL RIGHT- THE RISK MUST BE SUBSTANTIAL ABOUT TWO MORE POINTS- AS FAR AS THE UP PRESSURE OUR BODY WEIGHT INVOLVED WHEN IT COMES TO RESTRAINING A SUSPECT. AND THAT THAT PRESSURE OR THAT BODY WEIGHT ON THE PERSON WHO'S RESTRAINT MUST BE ON REASONABLE THE KEY WORD IS ON REASONABLE. RIGHT AND SO OBVIOUSLY- LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS HAVE TO- GENERALLY POVIDE A REASONABLE RESTRAINT ON A PERSON WHEN THEY'RE EFFECTING ARREST SO WE HAVE TO LOOK FOR WHAT UNREASONABLE AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT HAS A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF CARVING IS FIXED. THE THIRD POINT IS THAT WHEN A PERSON IS RESTRAINED ON THE FLOOR IN THE PRONE OR SUPINE POSITION- EIGHT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS SHOULD CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT PERSON CAN BREATHE. AND I THINK THAT IS- SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT- SHOULD SHOULD GO WITHOUT SAYING. AND SO WITH THAT I AM AVAILABLE TO TAKE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS REGARDING THE TECHNICAL ASPECT OF THIS BILL. I THANK YOU THANK YOU. THE NEXT YES GOOD AFTERNOON. ACTUALLY COMMITTEE CHAIR I JONES SAWYER VICE CHAIR LACKEY AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY MY NAME IS ROBERT COLLINS- MY STEP SON ANGELA CHIU DAHLE WHAT KILLED DURING THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS BY ENTERED POLICE OFFICERS WHEN THEY WERE CALLED BY MY DAUGHTER TO HELP WITH A MENTAL HEALTH EMERGENCY HE WAS EXPERIENCING. WHEN THE POLICE OFFICER ARRIVE YET CALMED DOWN AND WAS BEING HELD IN A TIGHT HUG. BY IS FOUR FOOT ELEVEN INCHES TALL MOTHER. ANGELO WAS NOT COMMITTING A CRIME AND THE OFFICERS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. ANGELA WAS PARANOID. BUT HE WAS NOT VIOLENT DID NOT EXIST IN ANY WAY AND FOLLOW ALL COMMANDS. HE WAS SCARED AND PARANOID. HE PLEADED FOR HIS LIFE NOT GIVE THE OFFICERS. PLEASE DON'T KILL ME. YOU DON'T JONES- THE OFFICERS PUT A MODEST AMERICAN HANCOCK THEM AND WHILE ONE OFFICER WHO SPENT HIS LEGS AND PUSH THEM UP AGAINST HIS BODY ANOTHER PUT ANY ON THE BACK OF ANGELES NECK. ONE OF THE PRODUCTOR GREW TIRED OF TAKING THE WEIGHT UNENCLOSED NECK. ANOTHER TOOK ITS PLACE AND CONTINUE TO APPLYING THE SAME TECHNIQUE. HE DID NOT CHECK ON THE CONDITION EVEN WHILE HIS MOTHER WHO WAS IN THE SAME ROOM THE WHOLE TIME. ASKED ABOUT HIM. HE WAS UNRESPONSIVE FOR EACH ONE A HALF MINUTES OF THE HOLD. AND REMAIN SO AFTER THE TRIP CAME OVER. AND LOOKED CONDITION DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE FROM FROM WHEN HE WAS RESTRAINED. HE WOULD NEVER BE THE GOVERNOR'S OWN. ANY SITES WERE NEVER ABLE TO CLOSE AGAIN. AND HAD TO BE PAID SHOT IN THE HOSPITAL UNTIL HIS OFFICIAL. DEATH ON DECEMBER TWENTY SIX. THE USE OF THIS RISK HAVE WIDELY BANNED LONG. EIGHT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. STATES HAVE SHOWN THAT POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT HAVE POLICIES PROHIBITING CHOKEHOLDS AND STRANGLEHOLD RESULT IN THE REDUCTION OF POLICE KILLINGS OF CIVILIANS BY 22% MANY CIVILIANS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN CALIFORNIA IN THIS MANNER YOU CAN IMAGINE.

IN AS MUCH AS A DOESN'T INCLUDE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE- REGARDING- THE THREAT INCIDENTS WHETHER TO THREAT OF DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY TO AN OFFICER OR ANOTHER PERSON. I WOULD JUST NOTE- AND WE HOPE CA WORKING- WHAT THE AUTHOR ON BILL BUT BUILDING OF SCHOOL ANY TECH IN WHICH PRESSURE BODY WEIGHT IS ON READ UP AGAINST RESTRAINT NECK TORSO OR BACK THEM QUOTE- IS OVERLY BROAD- REASONABLE WILL BE TO JUDGE FROM TO. THIS IN AND I WOULD JUST OUT THAT ACCORDING TO THE THAT RESTRICTS- FORGET REGARD PLACING A RISK APPROACH ASSUME POSITION BUT A STANCE GREENCORE A PERSON WORST TO OR ON A GURNEY. LIMITING THE USE OF APPROPRIATE PHYSICAL RESTRAINT TECHNIQUES BY TRAINED OFFICERS DECREASES OPTIONS ALONG THE SPECTRUM OF APPROPRIATE FORCE AND COULD INCREASE RELIANCE ON OTHER TOOLS INCLUDING.

OVER TWENTY NINE THOUSAND MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION WE ARE ACTUALLY CO SPONSORS OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS BILL EIGHTY FOUR NINETY AND ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT COLLEGES FOR DIALING IN LATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. RIGHT THANK YOU WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS REBEKAH. POWER QUE HAN AND MR LEE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WANT TO THANK BOTH THE AUTHOR AND MR BONTA FOR RINGING THE BELL AND FOR YOUR COMMENTS ON MR CANTO- AND HIS. TRAGIC DEATH- I TO HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH HIS FAMILY AND HEAR ABOUT HIS INCREDIBLE LIFE AND WE KNOW THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN INCREDIBLE LIFE THERE COUNTY OTHER OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE- TO CONTINUE IT AND- SO I THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT MEASURE THE LOOK SO WHAT HAPPENED. WHAT IS HAPPENED NOW WE KNOW TOO MANY BECAUSE ONE IS TOO MANY INCIDENTS WHERE SOMEONE LOSES THEIR LIFE UNNECESSARILY BECAUSE OF THESE. CHOCOLATES I JUST HAD ONE QUESTION WHICH IS- WITH MISTER SAYS A LOVELY SPEAKING FOR THE SHERIFF'S AT MENTIONED SOMETHING THAT I KNOW YOU'RE COMMITTED TO BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT IT HE SAID IT HERE TODAY WHICH IS. THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ALLOWED TO USE THE SOCIAL FIXATIONS WHERE THERE IS- WHERE DEADLY FORCE IS APPROPRIATE BUT THAT'S WITH. YEAH THIS IS LEADING TO DEATH AND THAT'S THE SITUATION WHERE THIS SHOULD BE USED SO CAN YOU PLEASE ADDRESS HIS CONCERNS ABOUT THE VAGUE NATURE OF THAT ALLOWANCE AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GONNA DRESS THAT. SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTION. WE'RE LAW. IS DO THEIR JOB. WE'RE SAYING THAT IN THEY'LL MISSION OF YOUR JOB. YOU SHOULD NOT BE CUTTING SOMEONE'S OX YOU KNOW. EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO BRING REAL BREATHING RIGHT NOW. AND IF YOU'RE IF THERE'S SOMETHING DONE THAT RESTRICTS THAT OXYGEN. YOU WILL. ALSO LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS AND THEN ALSO MAY DIE FOR SUCH A LONG TIME SPECIALLY IF IS RESTRICTED OFFICERS WERE NOT. THIS WILL NOT- CHANGE- OFFICERS ABILITY. TO RESTRAIN A INDIVIDUAL- THAT THEY COME IN CONTACT WITH IT ONLY FOCUSED IN ON. RESTRICTING SOMEONE'S ABILITY TO BREATHE. YOU CAN PLACE THEM ON THE FLOOR PUT THEIR THEIR NEEDS ON THEIR BACK IN BETWEEN THE FLOOR AND THE KNEE IT WILL COMPRESS. THE LUNGS AND YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO BRING. WE'RE SAYING THAT YOU. WOULD YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE A BRIEF ARE YOU GOING TO KILL SOMEONE. AND THIS BILL FOR NINETY SPEAKS THAT VERY ISSUE. SO I HEAR YOU I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT- THAT THAT AND MR CELL I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO CHIME IN THAT THIS QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT IT CAN BE USED WHERE THERE IS A RISK OF DEATH TO THE OFFICER- RIGHT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE USED BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS- DOES THAT ALLOW FOR IT TO BE USED WHEN THERE IS. WHEN AN OFFICER IS LOST HIS OR HER WEAPON RIGHT AND THERE IS A RISK OF DEATH TO THE OFFICER AND THE OFFICER HAS A RIGHT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES I MEAN THAT IS ABSOLUTELY. RIGHT THE OFFICER HAS A RIGHT TO DEFEND HIM OR HERSELF IN THE OMISSION OF RESTRAINING AN INDIVIDUAL WE'RE SIMPLY SAYING IN THE ACT EVEN WHEN YOU COME DOWN TO GEORGE FLOYD- AND HE WAS ON THE NECK WHICH RESTRICTED HIS. OXYGEN FLOW WHICH CAUSING CONSCIOUSNESS WITHIN SAID BUT THEN IT COST HIM TO DIE THE SAME AN ISSUE OF MR CAME TO. THE SAME METHOD WAS APPLIED THAT CALLS AND CONSCIOUSNESS AND THEN HE LATER DIED AS A RESULT OF IT SO THIS BILL DOES NOT A LOT DOES NOT HINDER A POLICE OFFICER. FROM DOING HIS OR HER JOB OR STOP THE PERSON FROM DOING BODILY HARM TO THE POLICE OFFICER AND OR TO SOMEONE ELSE. GOT IT OKAY SO I MEAN I THINK OBVIOUSLY. GEORGE ANGELO KANTO ARE EXAMPLES WHERE THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY MISUSED AND I THINK WE ARE TAKING THE RIGHT STEPS TO ENSURE IT ISN'T USED- I THINK THAT WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO ALLOW OFFICERS WHO. I NEED TO DEFEND THEMSELVES BECAUSE THERE IS- TRIED TO THEIR LIFE THE RIGHT TO DO SO BECAUSE THEY PUT THEMSELVES IN HARM'S WAY NOT THAT WAS NOT THE SITUATION WITH EITHER ANGELO PINTO WHO IS HANDCUFFED TO THE GROUND AND COMPLETELY NOT A FRAT FOR CHARTER FLIGHTS RIGHT. I'M MORE MANY OTHERS AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S WHERE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THE CHANGES MADE- BUT I APPRECIATE THIS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING IT AND WE WILL WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST AGAIN AS WAS STATED. INTO RECORD ELEVEN NINETY SIX WE HAD THIS THIS LANGUAGE IN ELEVEN NINETY SIX WE TOOK IT OUT WE MOVE THE CHOKEHOLD CHRONIC ARE RESTRAINS- FORGOT THAT BILL SIGNED AND WE WORKED WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THAT REGARD AND WE WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS REGARD AS WELL. AND ALSO JUST WANT TO MAKE MENTION THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WORKED WITH US ON THIS LANGUAGE. AND A CONTINUING WITH US IN THIS REGARD. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU AND MISTER LEE. I SAW THANKED THE FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND FOR OUR FUTURE FOR ALL BRING ATTENTION TO I ALSO AS HOW IMPORTANT AND ALSO I THANK THE RESILIENCY OF THE KINGS OF FAMILY FOR COMING HERE AND SHARING THE STORY I HAVE TRAGIC IT IS I SERIOUSLY I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR BRING MORE ATTENTION TO THE STORY I THINK. IS TERRIBLE AND AWFUL IS MORE PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING YOU RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND ESPECIALLY TO ALL PEOPLE OF COLOR RIGHT ASIAN AMERICANS INCLUDED AND THE KIDS ARE CASES INCREDIBLY TRAGIC AND TERRIBLE AND I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE CONTROVERSIAL THAT POLICE SHOULD BE DENYING SOMEONE'S RIGHT TO BREATHE AS YOU SAID AND IT'S A COMMON SENSE I THINK IT'S A COMMON SENSE APPROACH OF DOING IT THE RIGHT WAY AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT AND IT ALSO HAS TO BE AT ITS A CO AUTHOR WHEN THE TIME IS APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HONOR TO ADD YOU AS A CO AUTHOR MISTER LUCKY WAS NEXT MR WICKS. YEAH THIS IS ONE OF. AWKWARD TOPIC FOR ME- ADDRESS FROM THE DO. BEST I. BECAUSE I TAKE THE- THE UNPOPULAR POSITION HERE. OF- JUST TRYING TO EXPRESS TO YOU THE CHALLENGE OF DEALING WITH SOMEBODY WHO IS- VIOLENTLY RESISTING VIOLENTLY- A THREAT TO THOSE IN AN IMMEDIATE AREA. I'M THE ONLY ONE PROBABLY IN THIS ROOM I LEAST I HOPE I AM THAT OF YOU ARE A COP FOR A YEAR BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY. INSTANCES YOU HAD WHERE THIS WAS A TRUE THREAT TO YOU. BUT I CAN TELL YOU I'VE HAD MULTIPLE. MULTIPLE TIMES WHERE. I KNOW THAT THE PERSON WE WERE TRYING TO SUBDUE. WOULD BE WILLING TO TAKE MY LIFE. IN ORDER TO GET AWAY. AND IT'S HARD FOR. THOSE OF US WHO HAVE CARRIED THAT CHALLENGE TO EXPRESS TO OTHERS HOW THAT FEELS AND I'M NOT TRYING TO EXCUSE THE MISCONDUCT OF OFFICERS I DON'T KNOW ONE PERSON. I'VE LEAST I'VE NEVER SPOKEN TO ANYONE WHO SUPPORTS THE ACTIONS TAKEN AGAINST GEORGE WILL AND THAT WAS AN OUTRAGE AND I THINK IT'S BEEN TAKEN CARE OF RIGHT NOW- AND THE CATO SITUATION I'D- I CAN'T. DO ANYTHING BUT FEEL VERY SADDENED THAT IT HAD THE OUTCOME IT DID NO ONE WANTS A DEADLY OUTCOME NO ONE THE PEACE OFFICER DOESN'T WANT THAT AND I KNOW THE VICTIM DOESN'T WANT THAT- AND SO. WHAT WHAT SEEMS TO BE. THE COMMON OCCURRENCE AT LEAST IN THE SENTIMENT OF THOSE ON THE OUTSIDE IS THAT OFFICERS ARE THE AGGRESSORS. AND I WILL TELL YOU. MAYBE IN SOME INSTANCES THEY ARE IF THEY ARE THAT'S REGRETTABLE IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE. BUT WHAT IS APPROPRIATE IS THE ABILITY TO TRY TO BRING ORDER AND CALL TO A VERY VIOLENT SITUATION. AND WHEN YOU USE THE TERM POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA THE SIX YEAR IT GOES WAY BEYOND CHOKING- I CAN TELL YOU THAT- WHEN YOU START WHEN YOU PLAY WITH A COMMON- TACTIC THAT HAS TO BE USED WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE THAT'S EXTREMELY VIOLENT. OF ANIL THIS HAPPENED TO ME SO MANY TIMES WHERE YOU HAVE A SUSPECT YOU HANDCUFF YOU PLACED IN A PATROL CAR AND THEIR SOUL. ACT UP FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD THE KICK OUT THE WINDOWS IN THE PATROL CAR. YOU HAVE TO TAKE ACTION AND SO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS YOU HAVE TO PLAY A LEG RESTRAINT. ALONG WITH THE HAND RESTRAINT. AND WHAT HAPPENS IN MANY INSTANCES YOU HAVE THE SUSPECT NOW THAT YOU'RE RESTRAINED. WHAT I BELIEVE IS AN APPROPRIATE RESTRAINT AND YOU PLACE THEM BACK IN THE VEHICLE THEY CONTINUE TO MOVE ABOUT THEY CONTINUE TO. TRY TO SHOW THEIR- DISAGREEMENT WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING AND IN DOING SO THEY'LL PUT THEMSELVES IN. CIRCUMSTANCES ESPECIALLY WHEN THE RESTRAINT THAT WAY THAT LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO BREATHE. AND YOU HAVE THIS VERY PROBLEM IT'S POSITIONAL ASPHYXIA AND THAT IS NOT A TACTIC. THAT WAS MISUSED BY THE OFFICER- AND I DON'T KNOW. WHAT YOUR SUGGESTION IS FOR AN ALTERNATIVE COURSE OF ACTION AND I'M HOPING I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO STOP THIS BILL. BUT I HOPE WHAT YOU'LL DO IS GENUINELY REACH OUT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COOPERATE WITH THEM AND- AND TRY TO TACTICALLY ADDRESS WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO AND BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESSES IT COMPLETELY SUPPORTABLE YOU YOU WANT TO ADDRESS. ABUSE EVERYBODY WANTS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT WANTS THAT BUT WE DON'T WANT IS UNINTENDED OUTCOMES WHERE THE OFFICERS BECOME. THE FOCUS OF ABUSE SO WHAT WE NEED IS A BALANCED APPROACH AND THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING FOR AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN GET THAT FROM YOU. THIS IS WENT TO VEGAS THE WAY I AND I KNOW WHAT YOUR TENSIONS ARE. AND YOU SAY THAT. IT WOULD RESTRICT THE OFFICERS ABILITY WELL. BASED ON THE VAGUENESS OF THE WAY THIS BILL AS CURRENTLY WORDED. IT MIGHT. AND SO THAT'S WE GOTTA GET RID OF AND I. I PROMISE YOU THAT IS TOO BIG RIGHT NOW. BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ALL THE OTHER PROFESSIONALS PLEASE WORK WITH THEM. PLEASE MAKE THIS BETTER. SO WE CAN ALL COME TOGETHER AND FIGHT WE WANT. TO FIGHT AND THAT'S ABUSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER WICKS. I THANK YOU- I THINK THE AUTHOR IN MY SEAT MATE- FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- APPRECIATE YOUR WORKING ADVOCACY OF A SUSPICIOUS SOMEONE IS FORMER LAW ENFORCEMENT- THESE ARE TOUGH ISSUES OBVIOUSLY THEY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED I'M I WOULD BE HONORED TO BE A CO AUTHOR AND LOOK FOR TO SUPPORTING THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR SIRIKA. THANK YOU. SORRY I DON'T I JUST GROWN FORTUNATELY LIKE- MR LACKEY I COME FROM SOME SIMILAR EXPERIENCES- I DID NOT WORK IN A VERY- KIND AREA. AND I'VE HAD THE UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE OF HAVING TO TREAT PEOPLE. WHO APPEAR TO HAVE DIED FROM THIS OF SPEAKS VIA- WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS OF SIXTY UP FROM- POSITIONAL- TYPE OF- AND- SITUATIONS- BUT HAVE ALSO BEEN KICKED IN THE FACE SPAT IN THE FACE- WE'VE HAD- OFFICERS. SEVERELY INJURED WITHOUT OFFICER SHOT. ALL FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE RESISTING. AND THAT'S WHEN WE THAT'S WHEN THESE TYPE OF SITUATIONS. GENERALLY OCCUR. IS WHEN THERE IS VIOLENT. AND UNPREDICTABLE- RESISTANCE TO WHATEVER'S IN A LOT OF TIMES IN IN THE CASES THAT I WERE ON I'M GOING ON- I MEAN I'VE HAD PEOPLE THAT WERE HANDCUFFED IN THE BACK OF A POLICE CAR. AND THEY PULL UP TO THE POLICE STATION THEY OPEN THE DOOR AND THE GUY'S DEAD. AND THE REASON THE GUY'S DAD IS BECAUSE HE'S HE- HE- WHAT RAN THROUGH A NEIGHBORHOOD. AFTER SPEED BALLING. AND AFTER TAKING IT THAT MEANS YOU TOOK METHAMPHETAMINE AT THE TIME WAS HEROIN- MACINNES HEROIN AND COCAINE AT THE SAME TIME- FENTON ALL WASN'T AROUND YET BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS NOWADAYS- D. C. P. A VERY UNPREDICTABLE DRUG. AND NOT YOU'VE BEEN ON A GUY WHO HAS PC. PC PIANE- I'LL TELL YOU PEOPLE WHO ARE FIVE FOOT SIX AND WEIGHS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY POUNDS- WILL TAKE SIX OFFICERS TO HOLD SOMEBODY DOWN LIKE THAT AND BY THE TIME THEY'RE DONE HOLDING THEM DOWN. GUESS WHAT THIS POSITIONAL. ASPHYXIA MAY HAVE OCCURRED- SO IT'S LIKE WHAT DO YOU DO I'VE SEEN PEOPLE BREAK THEIR ARMS FROM THOSE THINGS. SO FOR ME YOU KNOW WE'RE TAKING AWAY A LOT OF TOOLS THE POLICE OFFICERS WIND UP USING NOT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO. IT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO THEY HAVE TO DO IT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM OR OTHERS AND THAT'S MY CONCERN IS THAT WE'RE REALLY GETTING AWAY FROM- ALLOWING POLICE OFFICERS TO TRY TO USE LESS THAN THAN LETHAL FORCES. ALTHOUGH IT IS SOMETIMES THE COMBINATION DOESN'T ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. AND OF DRUG USE AND- A RESTRAINT- AND SO YOU KNOW THAT IT'S THOSE TYPE INCIDENT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH IT'S DIFFICULT FOR US- IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THE POLICE OFFICERS. AND YOU KNOW IT JUST VERY LIKE I SAID IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR. FOR US TO GET A GRASP ON WHERE THAT LITTLE MIDDLE GROUND IS THAT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY- THEIR ABILITY TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AND DEFEND OTHER PEOPLE. AND AT THE SAME TIME TRYING TO PROTECT THE PERSON THAT IS OUT OF CONTROL. AND SO YEAH THAT'S IT THAT'S MY DIFFICULTY WITH DAYS AND YOU'LL HEAR THAT YEAH I'M NOT GONNA KEEP REPEATING ON ALL THESE DIFFERENT. TYPES OF BILLS LIKE THIS. BUT YOU KNOW THAT SOME OF MY EXPERIENCE AND- IN. YOU KNOW SO THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S A DIFFERENT LENS THAT I LOOK AT THAT THROUGH FROM A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO HEAR ABOUT IT BUT- HAVEN'T ACTUALLY SEEN IT. SO THANK. YOU THANK YOU MR CLARK. OUR TWO THINGS FIRST I IN TERMS SAID YOU TO COMMITTEE. I SEE WHICH CHECK WHAT YOU TOOK WAS THE AMENDMENTS. SUGGESTED BY THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS SEPARATE. YES YEAH WHETHER ANY OTHER MEMBERS WHO TOOK.

BECAUSE GUESS WHAT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE WHEN I WAS IN UNIFORM. THAT MYERS WAS ABLE TO GO HOME. SAFELY JUST LIKE EVERY MAN WOMAN WHO'S IN UNIFORM WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THOSE INDIVIDUALS GET HOME SAFE TO THEIR LOVED ONES. AT THE SAME TIME WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT IF THE OFFICER OR ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT COME IN CONTACT WITH INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS AN EFFECT ARRESTS. THAT THE PERSON WHO THEIR AFFECTED ARREST ON. THEIR OXYGEN IS NOT RESTRICTED. THAT'S ALL WE'RE SAYING HERE WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT. TALK ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN GO TO JAIL BE ARRAIGNED- YOU KNOW BE TRIED BY THEIR A JUROR THAT PEERS. BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE SOME BAD OUT. IN A PROFESSION THAT ARE. AND WE CANNOT EVERY WITH THE SAME BRUSH BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE REAL WIENER NOW IS THAT PEOPLE WANT TO CAN. AND TRANSPARENCY AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ANGELO CAN'T OR THERE'S NO OTHER CA WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO OTHER GEORGE FLOYD IN CALIFORNIA. AND I BELIEVE THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND IT OPENS THE DOOR FOR REAL CONVERSATION AND I'M WILLING TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK BUT I VOTE THANK YOU. MR BONTA.

FOR ALL PEOPLE AND MANY OF YOU KNOW I'M FORMERLY INCARCERATED WHAT MANY DON'T KNOW IS THAT I HAD THREE CODEFENDANTS TOMB WHO TWO OF WHOM NEVER WENT TO PRISON BUT YOU MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN BECAUSE THEIR MUGSHOTS DOT JULIE MADE THE NEWS. OUR SYSTEM DOES LITTLE TO NOTHING TO PRESERVE ANYONE SENATE SETS MUGSHOT POSTING ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS JUST ANOTHER INSTANCE OF HOW WE DEMONISE SHANE AND OSTRACIZED INDIVIDUALS QUITE YET TO BE FOUND GUILTY OF ANYTHING. I WANT TO SPEAK TO BE A REPUTABLE DAMAGES. A MUG SHOT POSTED ONLINE CAN HAVE. MARCH THERE ARE DAMAGES TO PERSON. I WORKING IN IT BY ANY MEANS SO I WON'T PRETEND TO TELL YOU THE I DIDN'T DESERVE.

ANCIENT GREEKS BECAME SO OVERWHELMING SHE FELL VICTIM TO DRUGS WE HAVE HAD SO MANY SUICIDE ATTEMPTS I'VE LOST COUNT. MY FATHER MY FATHER HAD BEEN SPENT ON. GOLD CHAINS AND THE TRIAL WAS STILL YET TO COME.

APRIL SIXTEENTH MARCH MY FIVE YEARS OF BEING HOME I DEVOTED MY LIFE TO THIS WORK YET NO MATTER HOW MUCH COULD I DO THE IMAGERY OF MY MUGSHOT WILL FOREVER BE BRANDED IN THE MINDS AND HEARTS OF PEOPLE WHO ALWAYS JUDGMENT. YET NEVER KNOW ME. WE MUST REMEMBER AND DO ALL THAT WE CAN TO PRESERVE THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AND RECOGNIZED. IN THE BURDEN HARM CAUSED BY DEMONIZING PEOPLE. IT IS FOR THESE REASONS.

MISTER TERRY OF NO OPPOSITION IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU BRING ME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MR LEE AND MR LACKEY. HOW I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD IS VERY IMPORTANT AND AS SOME OF THE- WHEN THIS IS A TEST WITNESSES ATTESTED TO YOU KNOW SOCIAL MEDIA CAN BE USED AS A TOOL TO UPHOLD OUR SYSTEMS RACISM PERPETUATE THESE STEREOTYPES- BUT IN THAT'S WHAT I TWO QUESTIONS WHEN AS WE NEED HOUSES. SO IN THE GREENHOUSES IT'S STATES WE SHOULD CONSIDER MOVING THE PROOF REQUIREMENT ALTOGETHER AND SIMPLY MANDATE THE POLICE AGENCY REMOVE IT IF REQUESTED- FOREIGN NONVIOLENCE IT IN ARE YOU. OPEN TO AMENDING THAT PART OF THE BILL. I'M HAPPY TO FOR THE DAY CONVERSATIONS AROUND THAT TO BEST OF NOT CURRENTLY IN THIS COMMITTEE BUT- CERTAINLY OPEN TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS AROUND THE- IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AS- REFLECTED THE COMING OUNCES. OKAY AND ALSO MY SECOND QUESTION IS. IN THE SAME SPIRIT OF- MAKING SURE IT'S A PERPETUATING PEOPLES- YOU. GUILTY THIS BEFORE THEY'RE BEING TRIED WOULD YOU ALSO BE OPEN TO REMOVING MUGSHOTS OF ALL PEOPLE ARRESTED ALL CRIMES. NOT CURRENTLY AS YOU KNOW THAT IS REFLECTED IN THE BILL THEIR NUMBER OF MECHANISMS THAT STILL ALLOW FOR OF THOSE- TO BEST TO- HAVE THE TYPE OF PROTECTION IN MECHANISM PLACE. FOR THE PROTECTIONS OF THE INDIVIDUAL OF ALSO ENSURING THAT IT DOES RISE TO LEVEL OF PUBLIC FORM THAT THERE IS ALSO. OF THE MECHANISM TO HELP ADDRESS THAT THOSE ISSUES OF ALL TO BUT UNLESS HAPPY TO HAVE FOR THE CONVERSATIONS SHOULD LEAVE THIS COMMITTEE I GET TO THE FLOOR CERTAINLY I WOULD LIKE THAT KEEP HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE PROTECTING THE INNOCENCE OF A LOT OF PEOPLE AND- OF COURSE- NOT HOLDING THE STEREOTYPES. I ALSO SOME PRIVACY COMMITTEE SO WOULD LOVE TO- I LIKE SUPPORT THE BILL BUT ALSO LIKE TO SEE A LANGUAGE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR LACKEY.

WHY THE RETROACTIVITY IN TERMS OF THE APPLICATION SPECIFICALLY YES YES WELL I THINK AND WE WON'T WANT TO BEST ENSURE THAT THE SPIRIT OF THE INTENT- OR TRYING TO TACKLE HERE RIGHT NOW- INTO. THERE'S NO CONSISTENCY WITH RESPECT TO LOCAL AGENCIES AND SO THAT'S WHY ONE A UNIFORM APPROACH TO IT- AND BEST A TACKLING TACKLING THE ISSUE SPECIFICALLY ON THE A LOCALITIES SO I THINK THERE'S THE CHALLENGES EXIST THAT FOR THEIR EXAMPLE THIS CAME SPECIFIC FROM SAN FRANCISCO. WE WANT TO BEST UTILIZE SOME OF THOSE BEST PRACTICES. THANK YOU SHE NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YOU MAY CLOSE MISSILE ASPECTS WE ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- CHURCH RECOMMENDED I RECALLED ABOUT. THE BILL'S IMPROPERLY MOVED AND SECONDED ON AB FOURTEEN SEVENTY FIVE I SUMMONED LOW THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER- JONES SAWYER IRAQI.

A STEP THAT WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE TO IMPROVE THAT NUMBER BECAUSE NOT HAVING AN ID IS A SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENT. TO PEOPLE SUCCESS REDUCING RECIDIVISM. BEING ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY COME INTO SOCIETY. DO THE THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO RECOVER REHABILITATE AND- NAT RECEIPT OF A- SO. WE'RE WORKING ON A NUMBER OF THINGS IN AND LOOKING AT THE ANALYSIS I THINK. THAT THERE'S JUST SOME SOME POINTS I'D LIKE TO MAKE- APPRECIATE THAT THE IN DEPTH ANALYSIS IN THE WORK THAT YOUR COMPANY IS DONE WITH US OVER THE YEARS ON THIS. BUT WE'RE NOT EXPECTING PEOPLE TO TAKE DRIVER'S TESTS WHILE THEY'RE ON THE INSIDE THAT THAT IS NOT LEAVE EXEMPTED THAT DRIVER'S TEST. AND I DO UNDERSTAND THE POINTS ABOUT. CMV NOT BEING ABLE TO MAIL. THE ID TO AN INDIVIDUAL AND THAT'S CURRENTLY THE SITUATION NOW UNDER THE KELLY D. PROGRAM. IS CITIES HERE HOLD ON TO THOSE ID'S. UNTIL RELEASE BUT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE FACILITATING. GETTING THAT WORK DONE. GETTING THAT ID AVAILABLE WHATEVER BACKGROUND INFORMATION THOSE INDIVIDUALS NEED TO. GET THAT IF YOU PUT IN PLACE AND THEN WHEN THEY WERE LEAVING HAVE THAT ID. WHICH CONNECT THEM TO SERVICES GIVES THEM THE ABILITY TO DO THE PROGRAMMING. YEAH HOUSING AND MAKE THE CONNECTIONS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY HAVE SOMETIMES IT SO I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THIS COMMITTEES DONE WITH US OVER THE YEARS WORKING FOR WORK WITH CDC ARE ON THIS.

IN CALIFORNIA ALONE THERE ARE OVER FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED LEGAL BARRIERS TO RE ENTRY WE BELIEVE THAT ONCE A PERSON HAS DONE THEIR TIME THEN THEY HAVE SERVED THEIR CRIME THE ISSUE OF AIDID'S LICENSES AND CERTIFICATES HAS BEEN OUR PRIORITY FOR MANY YEARS THESE DOCUMENTS HAVE ACTED AS A PRIMARY BARRIER. TO ALL INDIVIDUALS RE ENTERING SOCIETY. I MISSED JEREMY THESE. ARE FOR MUCH NEEDED SERVICES. THAT OFTEN SERVICE CONDITIONS FOR AT LEAST. IN SOME CASES THE LACK OF THESE DOCUMENTS HAVE LED PEOPLE TO RE OFFEND. NO ONE WANTS TO RETURN TO INCARCERATIONS BUT MANY TOO. MANY TIMES BECAUSE OF COMPLICATIONS CREATED BY THESE POLICY. I HAVE HAD COUNTLESS COMMUNITY MEMBERS CALL ME IN TEARS OUT OF FEAR THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE TO GO BACK BECAUSE THEY'RE UNABLE TO ATTAIN IT NEATLY IF NECESSARY SERVICES. MOST OF THE TIME IT'S BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF DOCUMENTATION.

ONE AND THEN FEAR OF YOU IN OPPOSITION. AND WE HAVE NO OPPOSITION QUEUE AT THIS TIME MISTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH DO WE HAVE ANY OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM. IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM. OKAY DO WE HAVE ANY COMMENTS FROM- COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS GLADNESS YOU SEE ART OF. SO ON THE DRIVER'S LICENSE AND SAYS THEY'RE NOT GIVING OUT THEY'RE NOT DOING ON BEHIND THE WHEEL TASKS. HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THESE PEOPLE CAN DRIVE. THESE ARE REPLACEMENT DRIVERS LICENSES SO THEY'VE ALREADY DONE THAT AND IF NOT THEY'LL GET A CALIFORNIA IDEA IF THEY'RE QUALIFIED TO GET A CALIFORNIA ID AND WHAT'S TO STOP THE DMV AND THE CDC ARE FROM GETTING TOGETHER ON A PROGRAM DOESN'T REQUIRE A LOT. FOR THE DMV JUST GOES IN AND. AND PREPARES PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING RELEASED. BY ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE THE DMV WE WE'VE WE'VE HAD GREAT SUCCESS WORKING WITH CDC ARE ON THIS PROGRAM LESS WITH DMB. RIGHT I THINK THE- KEY IS TO STRENGTHEN OUR DIEM BE A LITTLE BIT. I HATE TO HAVE TO GET ARRESTED TO BE ABLE TO GET MY LICENSE. THE IN DEPTH. AND SOMETIMES I KNOW- DEALING WITH THE DMV YOU FEEL LIKE THAT MIGHT BE THE BETTER ROUTE. SO MAKING. YEAH. SURE ANY OTHER COMMENTS. HI I'M I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THAT APPEARS TO BE THE CALIFORNIA LAW DOES NOT ALLOW FOR AN OFFICIAL STATE ID CARD TO BE ISSUED INDIVIDUALS NOT LEGALLY PRESENT HERE. AND IT WOULD THEIR LOGICALLY MEAN BY DEFAULT AND UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS MUST BE ISSUED AN AB SIXTY DRIVER'S LICENSE PLATE RELEASED FROM CUSTODY UNDER THE BILL. WHERE MY WRONG THERE NO NO THAT'S NOT THE CASE THIS IS IF ELIGIBLE. SO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ISSUED A DRIVER'S LICENSE IF THEY DON'T QUALIFY FOR DRIVER'S LICENSE BUT IF THEY'RE GETTING A REPLACEMENT OR DUPLICATE. AND THE OTHER PART PART OF THIS IS THAT IT'S ASKING CD'S HERE TO HELP THESE PEOPLE GET THEIR DOCUMENTS IN ORDER SO THAT THEY IF THEY CAN'T GET CALIFORNIA ID OR DRIVER'S LICENSE OR GET THAT SETTLED. ON THE WAY OUT THAT THEY'LL THEN BE ABLE TO DO THAT EXPEDITIOUSLY ONCE THEY DO GET OUT. IF THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR PARTICULAR DOCUMENT. ONE WILL NOT BE ISSUED SHOW THEM WHAT KIND OF I. D. WOULD- AND UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS BE ISSUED THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO THE DRIVER'S LICENSE IF THEY OTHERWISE QUALIFY. I'M SORRY. I'M NOT FOLLOWING YOU HERE IF THEY DON'T HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE. AND THEN THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET. OKAY THEN WHAT KIND OF IDEA THEY'RE GOING TO GET THERE AND THEY MAY NOT GET ANY ID BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS THEN GET CITIES HERE TO HELP THEM WITH WHATEVER DOCUMENTATION THEY- DO NEED TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT'S FEASIBLE. SO THAT WHEN THEY DO GET OUT THE THEY COULD HAVE. TAKEN TO APPLY. AND GET AN IDEA. SO THIS IS THIS IS GETTING THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE ID'S OR DRIVER'S LICENSES. AND THIS IS TRYING TO GET. HELP TO GET DOCUMENTS IN ORDER TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE SO THAT WHEN THEY DO GET OUT IF THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO GET ONE. THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO APPLY APPROPRIATELY ONCE THEY'RE OUT OF THE COMMUNITY. YEAH THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL. SAVES TO SEND A CONFUSING MESSAGE OF FACTORS I THINK THAT WAS EVEN. IT UP IN THE ASSESSMENT AS A CONFUSING POINT- BY THIS COMMITTEE AND SO BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF CLARITY I MEAN I AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW I CAN'T SUPPORT. ISSUING A DOCUMENT TO SOMEBODY BECAUSE I'M AFRAID WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THE AB SIXTY ELEMENT WOULD BE PURSUED. WHICH I'D I WOULDN'T BE COMPLETELY OPPOSED TO AS LONG AS THEY HAD THE DRIVING- MECHANISM UNDERTAKEN WHERE THEY ACTUALLY CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY HAVE DRIVING ABILITY- THIS IS JUST A VERY CONFUSING. CIRCUMSTANCE AND HOW WOULD AND HOW IT ADDRESSES UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE. THAT THAT'S MY THE OTHERS ARE VERY CLEAR AND I THINK IT'S EVEN NOBLE. BUT THE REST OF IT THIS LACK OF CARITY ON THIS ISSUE MAKES ME VERY UNEASY- OKAY I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD BECAUSE THIS IS ALL. WHAT SOMEBODY CAN APPLY FOR INSTANCE WE'VE EXEMPTED DRIVING TESTS IF SOMEONE DOESN'T ALREADY HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE. I DON'T SEE DMV IS TO A DRIVER'S LICENSE WITHOUT AN APPROPRIATE DRIVING TEST. WELL SO THERE'S SORT OF AN A PRIORITY ISSUE. DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM ANYBODY ON THE COMMITTEE YES. THANK YOU MISTER RIGHT HERE I JUST WANT TO THANK MR STONE- FOR BRINGING THIS AND YOU KNOW I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE AS A COMMITTEE STRIVE TO DO ALL THE TIME AND WE AS A LEGISLATURE IS TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM OUR RECIDIVISM RATES IN THE STATE ARE WAY TOO HIGH. WHICH MEANS YOU KNOW WORSE OUTCOMES HIGHER COSTS IN OUR PRISONS AND MORE CRIME IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND I IS SIMPLE THINGS LIKE THIS THAT ALLOW SOMEONE TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET WHEN THEY LEAVE PRISON. AND REENTER THEIR COMMUNITIES SUCCESSFULLY AND I THINK THIS IS A SMALL MEASURE THAT MAY HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON THE LIVES OF THOSE LEAVING OUR SYSTEM STUFF TOGETHER SAID AS PART OF A NUMBER JUST. CLOSE WITH THIS IT SAYS IN THIS READING DIRECTLY FROM YOUR BILL IT SAYS THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES SHALL ENSURE THAT ALL NOT IF YOU HAD PRIOR ALL INMATES RELEASED FROM STATE PRISON ARE RELEASED WITH A VALID CALIFORNIA IDENTIFICATION CARD. OR DRIVER'S LICENSE. THERE'S NO EXCEPTIONS THERE. IF YOU HAD A PRIOR SO I'M JUST VERY CONFUSED BY IT AND- I'LL LET YOU CLOSER ALL RIGHT S. ZERO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE READY TO CALL FOR THE QUESTION.

THIS SORT OF EVIDENCE THAT IS NECESSARY FOR SOUND POLICY MAKING. THIS WORK RELIES ON ACCESS TO INDIVIDUAL LEVEL IDENTIFIED DATA THIS STUDY SIMPLY CAN'T BE CONDUCTED OTHERWISE. THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN STRICT ADHERENCE TO PRIVACY PROTOCOLS ESTABLISHED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND BY FUNDING AGENCIES SUCH AS THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH AND THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE. AND IN THIRTY YEARS THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A PRIVACY BREACH. THIS WORK PROCEEDED WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE TOURNEY'S GENERAL FUND JOHN DANTE CAMP TO COMELEC HARRIS. IT WAS WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT SUCH RESEARCH WOULD CONTINUE AND IN ITS RECOGNITION THAT CALIFORNIA IS DEMOCRACY'S LEADING LABORATORY IN THE FIELD THAT THE LEGISLATURE CREATED THE NATION'S FIRST PUBLICLY FUNDED CENTER FOR RESEARCH ON FIREARM VIOLENCE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. UNFORTUNATELY AN ATTITUDE UP OPPOSITION TO THE INDEPENDENT STUDY SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF VIOLENCE TOOK ROOT AT DOJ'S EXECUTIVE LEVEL BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. THE BILL BEFORE YOU SEEKS TO RESET THE BALLOT IN THE MIDST OF A NATIONWIDE VIOLENCE EPIDEMIC THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW RESEARCHERS AT THE CENTER AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND AT OTHER UNIVERSITIES AROUND CALIFORNIA TO DO THEIR WORK AND HELP PREVENT DEATH AND INJURY FROM VIOLENCE IN OUR STATE.

CALIFORNIA'S BEEN A STRONG ADVOCATE FOR PRIVACY PROTECTION FROM THE PUBLIC HAS ALSO SPOKEN THROUGH THE BALLOT BOX THIS BILL UP AND PRIVACY LAWS IN THE STATE UP TO MAJOR LIABILITY ISSUES. THERE'S NO CREDIBLE REASON WHY ANY RESEARCH ENTITY WITH THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT VIOLATES CONSUMER PRIVACY. THIS INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE PROVIDED TO ANYBODY BUT G. O. J. TO OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT HAVE STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION FOR AN INVESTIGATION. SOME OF THE TROUBLING STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE UCC YOU THREE DAYS SUGGESTED AS NECESSARY YET PROVIDE NO NECESSARY DEFINITION OF NECESSARY OR CONTEXT. OF PERSONAL INFORMATION DISCLOSURE. STILL IT'S A CLASS FONG IN HAND APPROACH FILE YOU D. PROVIDE DISTRICT TO A BILL OR NOW REACH AND THE- NO DEFINITE OF THE- OF PROVIDE AND I'M THIS BILL SUPPORTER OF THE BILL COULD QUALIFY PERHAPS TECH COMPANY DOING RESEARCH ON FACIAL RECOGNITION. THE DECISION TO SHARE THIS INFORMATION WILL BE MADE BY THE RESEARCH CENTERS OWN INTERNAL INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD HERE GT RECORDED IN A RECENT NEWSPAPER ARTICLE THEY WOULD PROTECT PRIVACY BY A SECURE. PASSWORD PROTECTED SERVER. EVERYONE KNOWS WE HAVE HAD SERIOUS BREACHES. WITH WITH MOST OF OUR GOVERNMENT. FRANKLY AND MOST RECENTLY STANFORD HAD A HALF OF PERSONAL MEDICAL INFORMATION THIS PROVIDES LITTLE COMFORT IN AB TWELVE THIRTY SEVEN STATES NOTHING ABOUT AFFILIATES PRIVACY PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS AT ITS CORE THEY WANT TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS AGENCIES. THIS MAJOR IS SILENT ON ANY REQUIREMENTS OF THOSE AGENCIES. TO GET AN OFTEN AUTHORIZATION FROM THE CONSUMER THIS BILL HAS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UNDERGROUND MARKET IF INDIVIDUALS FEEL THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS BEING EXPOSED. THIS BILL HELPS PROFILING CONCERNS DOCKING AND PUBLIC SAFETY RISK FOR CONSUMERS THIS BILL IS A BREACH OF THE PUBLIC TRUST WITH GOVERNMENT. AND CONSUMERS THAT BELIEVE THEIR INFORMATION IS BEING USED FOR THE PURPOSE AUTHORIZED ONLY INCLUDING.

THAT ARE SAYING INSTEAD OF A NAME GIVES YOU A NUMBER AND SOME OF THE- CONDITIONS AROUND IT- DO YOU REALLY NEED A NAME. THANK YOU I WILL SAY AND I'D ASK THAT COMMITTEE SECRETARY CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG THAT THIS BILL IS DOUBLE FURRED AND HEADING TO PRIVACY NEXT WHERE I KNOW THOSE ISSUES WILL BE THOROUGHLY VETTED SO I DID WANT TO POINT THAT OUT TO THE COMMITTEE- JUST FOR YOUR OWN KILEY CLAIMS BUT I WILL- LET GAREN WINTEMUTE ANTICS THAT IF YES ANSWER. TENSION JUST ONE- WHETHER WE'RE DOING A RANDOMIZED TRIAL OR- AN OBSERVATIONAL STUDY WE'RE DOING A RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF APPS WERE DOING. AN OBSERVATIONAL STUDY OF THE GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER POLICY- THAT ALL OF THE MOST RIGOROUS METHODS. FIRE FOLLOWING INDIVIDUAL CASES THE REASON WE CAN'T DO THAT WITH ANONYMIZED DATA SORRY- BACKGROUND NOISE. THAT WE FOLLOW INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE TO MULTIPLE RECORD SYSTEM SO FOR EXAMPLE I THIRTEEN ASKED TRIAL STOCK OUTCOME OF INTEREST. IT'S FIVE.

I'M AT TWELVE THIRTY SEVEN PLACE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM THE MOTION IS TO PATCH THE PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. LACKEY NO LACKING NO BARRICADE HAN HI ERIC HE HAD A CORK BY CORK I SANTIAGO. THEY ARE TOO SCARED TO KNOW WICKS. THE LI. MOTOR VEHICLE NEED TO MORE IN THIS MCCARTY STILL NOT HERE GOD. YOU'VE GOT IT THANK YOU MR RICHER I WILL NEVER THAT AB SO. THIRTY ONE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS EIGHTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE IS THE REINTRODUCTION OF LAST YEAR IS AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY THREE WHICH PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND WOULD REQUIRE COUNTY SHERIFF'S STATEWIDE TO COMPILE AND SUBMIT DATA ON. ONE OFFENDER RECIDIVISM PROGRAMS PROVIDED TO INMATES IN COUNTY JAILS AND OVER TO THE SUCCESS RATES IN REDUCING RECIDIVISM IN THOSE PROGRAMS EACH YEAR SINCE REALIGNMENT WAS ENACTED APPROPRIATIONS IN STATE BUDGET DOLLARS. HAVE GONE TO OUR COUNTIES TO IMPLEMENTED DIVERSE APPROACHES FOR SUPERVISION AND REHABILITATION PROGRAMS THAT AIM TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM. SINCE THEN INFORMATION ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S RECIDIVISM PROGRAMMING SPECIFIC TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTY JAILS IS FRAGMENTED AND DIFFICULT TO DIGEST. IT SIMPLY NONSENSICAL TO CONTINUE TO INVEST STATE DOLLARS IN PROGRAMMING WHERE WE HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER THESE PROGRAMS ARE SUCCESS OR FAILURE. TO THAT POINT RECENTLY STATE AUDITOR CONDUCTED A COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT OF THE ALAMEDA FRESNO IN L. A. COUNTY SYSTEMS AND HER FINDINGS WHICH WERE PUBLISHED LAST MONTH SPEAK EXACTLY TO WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE. THE AUDIT FOUND QUOTE THE STATE ALLOCATED SIX BILLION DOLLARS TO CALIFORNIA'S COUNTIES IN FISCAL YEARS TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY. HOWEVER BECAUSE THE THREE COUNTIES REVIEWED HAVE NARROWLY INTERPRETED THE SCOPE OF PUBLIC SAFETY REALIGNMENT FUNDING THEIR COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS PARTNERSHIP COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING SUCH SPENDING. HAVE OVERSEEN LESS THAN 20% OF THE FUNDING THE COUNTIES RECEIVED EACH COUNTY ALSO MAINTAINS EXCESSIVE REALIGNMENT SURPLUSES WHICH THEY COULD SPEND TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY. FINALLY THE COUNTIES LACK COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING AND OVERSIGHT FOR REALIGNMENT SPENDING WITHOUT WHICH THEY CANNOT MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS. THE AUDIT SKI THE REPORT SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO THE HEART OF THIS BILL IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US IS THE LEGISLATURE TO BRING FULL TRANSPARENCY TO THESE PROGRAMS. AND OUR SPENDING WE HAVE SPENT OVER SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDS AND WE HAVE VERY LITTLE INFORMATION ON HOW THAT INVESTMENT IS WORKING. THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE STANDARDIZED LOOK AT THOSE PROGRAMS AND FIND OUT WHERE THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL WE TALK A LOT IN THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT MAKING DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM. AND YET WE ARE COLLECTING THE DATA NECESSARY TO DO THAT WORK SO I URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO PASS THIS BILL AND GET ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON WHERE THOSE DOLLARS ARE GOING WHAT'S WORKING WHAT ISN'T. SO WE CAN EXPAND ON THOSE PROGRAMS THAT ARE WORKING BECAUSE REDUCING RECIDIVISM MEANS BETTER OUTCOMES. IT MEANS LESS SPENDING IN PRISON DOLLARS AND IT ALSO MEANS INCREASED SAFETY IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY OR WHO THEY BURN OFF FROM THE ELEVATOR SET BAKER CENTER IN EXTORT OPEN FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. K. OPERATOR. WE'RE READY TO- HERE THE- TESTIMONIES SUPPORT. THANK YOU BOTH SIDES ARE OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JOSE BUT NOT ON THE ORGANIZING DIRECTOR AT DELLA BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS BASED IN OAKLAND THE ELLA BAKER CENTER WORKS TO ADVANCE RACIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE FOR PEOPLE WITH LOW INCOMES AND PEOPLE OF COLOR BY SHIFTING RESOURCES AWAY FROM PRESIDENT THAN PUNISHMENT I'M TOWARD OPPORTUNITIES THAT MAKE OUR COMMUNITY SAFE HEALTHY STRONG. AS SOMEONE WITH EXPERIENCE INCARCERATION FIRSTHAND AND HAS BEEN HAS BENEFITED GREATLY FROM SUPPORT SERVICES I KNOW HOW ESSENTIAL AND LIFE SAVING IT IS ONE STATE INVESTMENT VALUABLE TAX DOLLARS INTO HEALT DEPARTMENT RESOURCES. IS MY OPINION THAT THIS IS ALWAYS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE WOULD REALIGN FUNDS BECAME AVAILABLE TO COUNTIES. OVER THE COURSE OF YEARS THAT MONITOR CONDITIONS AND BUDGET THAT SEVERAL COUNTY JAILS INCLUDING ALAMEDA COUNTY SANTA RITA JAIL ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO THE ELLA BAKER CENTER LED A CAMPAIGN THAT HAD A VERY SIMPLE ASK FOR ALAMEDA COUNTY SUPERVISORS IT WAS APPROVED A FINANCIAL AND PERFORMANCE AUDIT OF THE SANTA RITA JAIL. WE WANTED CAMPAIGN IN RESPONSE TO SEVERAL DISCREPANCIES WE WERE NOTICING A COUNTY JAIL SPENDING AS WELL AS AN ALARMING RATE OF CIVIL SUITS ALLEGING MISTREATMENT AND ABUSE FOR EXAMPLE THE JAIL POPULATION IT DECREASED BY NEARLY HALF OR THE LOST OVER THE LAST QUARTER DECADE. YET DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME THE SHARES BUDGET INCREASED BY AT LEAST DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH PEOPLE INSIDE THE JAIL RATE VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS OVER HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE NEGLECT AND MISTREATMENT. Y. LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS BY FAR THE LARGEST DEALER IN THE NATION BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN GENERATED JAIL HAD A RATE THAN LOS ANGELES THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AND SADLY JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO ANOTHER HUMAN BEING DIED WHILE IN CUSTODY SANTA RITA JAIL. COUNTY OFFICIALS NEVER APPROVED OUR REQUEST REGIONAL AUDIT AND TO DATE WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT WHERE THE JAIL SPENDING EXPLAINS I HIGHLIGHTS HOW TO BE A JAIL AS A CLEAR EXAMPLE OF A JAIL WITH VERY LITTLE TRANSPARENCY OR ACCOUNTABILITY BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM ACROSS THE STATE. DESPITE CALIFORNIA ALLOCATING BILLIONS IN FUNDING TO COUNTIES. FOR RECIDIVISM REDUCTION PROGRAMMING. THE BY THE- SPATE AUDITOR WE- FUNDS. THERE'S BEEN NO REGULAR ORGANS DATA COLLECTION ON THE PA OF COUNTY. BALLOT POGUE FOR SIX. IN THE OF A CALL WITH MY- PAN. THE STATE. STATE A FIVE DOLLAR DEBT. AS AS THE- MY PLAN. CURRENTLY IN FROM. ON THE- OF RECIDIVISM PROGRAMS THE STATE PRESIDENT AVAILABLE INSURANCE STATE DOLLARS ARE USED AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE. WE DO NOT HAVE THE STATE INFORMATION SHARED AT THE COUNTY JAIL LEVEL. THIS PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LEGISLATORS TO MAKE FULLY INFORMED DECISIONS ON THE BEST USE OF FUNDING. AIMED AT PROGRAMS TO SHOW PREVENT RATE OF REDUCING RECIDIVISM. BUT HE WHO DOES THE ELLA BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS- RESPECT EIGHT OF SUPPORT EIGHTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE AND RESPECT WE URGE LEGISLATORS. TO PASS THIS IMPORTANT BILL THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. MISTER VICE CHAIR THIS IS NEXT TO THE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVEN THIRTY ONE- ADDED PART EIGHTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE OF THE TRANSPARENCY BILL ALLOWED WHAT LEGISLATION PUBLIC DETERMINE HOW EFFECTIVELY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS ARE USING STATE FUNDS FOR PROGRAM IN COUNTY JAILS. SOME COUNTY TO SUCCESSFULLY UTILIZE THE FUNDING OPPORTUNITY PROVIDED BY REALIGNMENT TO CREATE INNOVATIVE AND SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM HAS REDUCED. RECIDIVISM RATE ALLOWED FORMALLY INCARCERATED CALIFORNIANS TO RECHARGE YOUR COMMUNITIES OTHERS HAVE NOT. THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN A PROGRAM IS SPONSORED WE AFFECTED THE REDUCE RECIDIVISM RATES FOR MORE TROUBLINGLY DEMONSTRABLY INEFFECTIVE THERE'S NO STATEWIDE REPORTING MECHANISM TO REPORT AT THE PROGRAM'S RESULTS. PUT MORE SIMPLY CALIFORNIA DOESN'T KNOW WHICH REHABILITATION PROGRAMS ARE GOOD ADVENTURE FACT BECAUSE DATA ABOUT THE SUCCESS RATE IS EITHER NOT CAPS WERE NOT SHARED. EIGHTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE BY REQUIRING COUNTY SHERIFF'S REPORT ON HOW THEY'RE USING STATE PROVIDED ONE TIMES AND SUCCESS RATES OF THEIR CHOSEN REHABILITATION PROGRAMS. SUCH A CRIME NOT ONLY ENSURE THAT IN EFFECT TO PRODUCE COMMODIFIED FACT PROGRAMS ANYWAY IT WILL ALSO PROVIDE THE PUBLIC IN THIS BODY WITH ACTUAL DATA FUSION ALLOCATING SCARCE RESOURCES THE FUTURE. BECAUSE EIGHTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE MAKE SURE THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE BUYING WITH TAXPAYER MONEY ALLOW BETTER INFORMED DECISION MAKING IN THE FUTURE CPA. ASK YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CORY CELLS- ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO AB SEVEN THIRTY ONE SHERIFFS ACROSS THE STATE PROVIDE MEANINGFUL REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING TO JAIL AND MAKES WITH THE DESIRE TO ENHANCE FORMALLY INCARCERATED PERSON YOU RE ENTRY INTO SOCIETY AND REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT PEOPLE RE OFFEND. UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL IMPOSES VAGUE AND BURDENSOME DATA COLLECTIONREQUIREMENTS WITHOUT ANY GUARANTEE OF FUNDING TO COVER THOSE COSTS. SB SEVEN THIRTY ONE REQUIRE SHERIFF'S REPORT QUOTE DATA ON EACH OF THE ANTI RECIDIVISM. UNIQUE DATA ON EACH OF THE ANTI RECIDIVISM PROGRAMS THEY PROVIDE INMATES IN THE COUNTY JAIL FACILITIES ONE QUOTE. THE SCOPE OF WHAT IS SOUGHT BY THIS LANGUAGE IS UNCLEAR AND IS UNLIKELY TO YIELD DISTRICT RESPONSES FROM THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL FAILS TO DEFINE QUOTE REASSIGNED AND QUOQUE SUCCESS AS IT RELATES TO RECIDIVISM AND THE OFFER PROGRAMS. AS A RESULT THE BILL COULD BE INTERPRETED AS REQUIRING COUNTY JAILS TO ASCERTAIN FROM CORK'S OTHER JAILS OR STATE PRISONS POTENTIALLY INCLUDING. SUCH ENTITY AND OTHER STATES. INFORMATION AS TO SUBSEQUENT ARRESTSOR CONVICTIONS. REQUIRING SUCH WOULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE A PROBLEM EXACERBATED BY THE FACT THE BILL PROVIDES THE FUNDING FOR ITS REQUIREMENTS. TO THE NOTE ABOUT THE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS PARTNERSHIPS AND THE PLANS CREATED UNDER PUBLIC SAFETY REALIGNMENT THOSE PLANS THAT ARE CREATED- ARE DONE SO IN A PUBLIC PROCESS THEIR- ENACTED BY STATUTORILY MANDATED COMMITTEE OF LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS.

WE FOREVER ARE DOING THINGS AND- EVEN IN PHYSICS YOU EXPECT ONE ANSWER AND YOU GET ANOTHER DEALING WITH PEOPLE YOU CAN DO SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS PERFECTLY REASONABLE HAS COMMUNITY SUPPORT. BUT IT DOESN'T WORK OR MAYBE IT DOES AND THEN WE'LL TO SPREAD IT. AS FAR AS THE MONEY GOES THAT ARE TO BE TAKEN OUT OF THE MONEY THAT USED FOR THE PROGRAM PERIOD- AND IN TERMS- YOU WANT SOME BETTER DEFINITIONS THAT'S ALWAYS GOOD I KNOW THE AUTHOR WILL DO THAT- SO I AM SUPPORTING THE BILL HAS IT BEEN MOVED. NOW I'LL MOVE IT. THANK YOU SO WHEN HAD ME AS A CO AUTHOR I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THANK YOU MR CLARK THANK YOU. MR LACKEY. YEAH I'M SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR BILL BUT OF CURIOUS TO LEARN HOW YOU ADDRESS THE GOVERNOR'S A CONCERN IS VITAL MESSAGE LAST TIME. YES SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS BROUGHT UP BY COMMITTEE WHICH AM I RESPECTING AGREE WITH IS CURRENTLY THERE'S NO DEFINITION OF RECIDIVISM IN THE LANGUAGE. LAST YEAR WITH THE BILL THE GOT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK DEFINED RECIDIVISM IS A PERSON WHO RECEIVED A NEW FELONY OR MISDEMEANOR CONVICTION OR PROBATION VIOLATION WITH THREE YEARS FROM THE OFFENDER'S PREVIOUS CRIMINAL CONVICTION. SARVESTAN FROM THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE THAT HE THOUGHT THAT WAS TOO BROAD A DEFINITION AND SO WE ARE WORKING TO BEAR WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO NARROW IT AND I HOPE THIS COMMITTEE WILL MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD TODAY SO WE CAN GET TO A- AN AGREED DEFINITION WITH THE GOVERNOR THAT IS NARROW ENOUGH SO WE HAVE THIS DATA WE KNOW HOW THESE DOLLARS ARE BASED BEING SPENT WE INSURE THEIR BEING SPENT ON PROGRAMS THAT WORK. AND WE WERE I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO GET TO AND OR OR DEFINITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS WITH QUESTIONS OR- RIGHT. YOU MAY CLOSE. RESPECT FASTER AYE VOTE.

JUST TRUST. GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL BUT WE ACTUALLY NEED TO HAVE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY AND LOOK INTO WAYS WE CAN WE CAN GET THE DATA SO THAT WE CAN MAKE INTELLIGENT DECISIONS ON WHICH WAY TO GO. AND NOT SPECULATE OR TAKE PEOPLE'S WORD FOR IT SO IT IS OUR AYE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THANK YOU. LAST FOUR. CALDERON.

LACKEY INSTANCE BARRICADE HELD HIGH MARKET HAD I QUIRK AYE QUICK AYE SAN DIEGO. CA ARE TO NOT VOTE C. R. TO NOT VOTING WICKS WICKS I LI LI I. THAT MEASURE PASSAGE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IF I MAY HAVE BEEN MY LAST BILL AB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX YEP. HI MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FIRST I WANT TO START BY PROFUSELY THANKING THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR INCREDIBLY HARD WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. AND WOULD BE GRANTED SHARE I'VE COMMITTED TO TAKING THE FOLLOWING MOMENTS IN PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEE IF WE PASS OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY WE WILL GO NEXT- SO JUST WANT TO LAY THOSE OUT FOR ALL OF YOU BECAUSE THEY DIFFER SLIGHTLY FROM WHAT. AND WAS IN THE ANALYSIS SO RETAINING THE MISDEMEANORS AND ALL VIOLATIONS IN THE BILL BUT ELEVATING THE FOLLOWING FOR VIOLATIONS AS WYLER'S ON A SECOND OFFENSE OR FOR OFFENSES INVOLVING THE USE OR THREAT OF FORCE GOVERNMENT CODE SIX TWENTY ONE EIGHT POINT OH ONE. A SECOND VIOLATION WHEN SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION ON RECORD LINE RESULTS IN BODILY INJURY. PENAL CODE FOR TWENTY THREE POINT THREE UNDER THE FACE ACT A SECOND VIOLATION OF A NON VIOLENT CRIME. PENAL CODE FOR TWENTY THREE POINT THREE C. UNDER THE FACE ACT. A FIRST VIOLATION INVOLVING THE USE OF THREATS OR FORCE AND IT. COULD FOR TWENTY THREE POINT THREE D. INTERFACE ACT A SECOND VIOLATION INVOLVING THE USE OF FORCE OR THREAT OF FORCE. IN A SECOND VIOLATION OF PROPERTY CRIMES. ALL FOUR OF THE SECOND VIOLATIONS OR AUTHORITIES WYLER'S- AN INCREASE PENALTIES WOULD FALL UNDER A THREE YEAR SUNSET. IN ADDITION WE ARE WORKING TO CLARIFY THE INTENT REQUIREMENTS FOR OFFENSES RELATED TO PUT. PHOTOGRAPHING OR VIDEO RECORDING TO INTIMIDATE PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS AND DISCLOSURE OF SUCH IMAGES AND RECORDING. AND I BELIEVE YOU MAY HEAR MORE OF THAT AND IT IS A REALLY TO THE TESTIMONY. AND FINALLY WE ARE MOVING PENAL CODE FOR TWENTY TWO POINT SIX FROM THE BILL. I HOPE THAT WAS CLEAR BUT I THINK THAT YOU ALL HAVE THAT. AND SO TODAY I'M PRESENTING THIS BILL WHICH AIMS TO REMEMBER THE SENSOR. YES I THANK. SO AB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX AIMS TO UPDATE OUR LAWS TO ADDRESS THE INSIDIOUS THREATS THAT PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CLINICS FACE PEOPLE HAVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO SEEK SERVICE SERVICES FIRM REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CLINICS WITHOUT THEIR FREE WILL BEING VIOLATED WHEN ONE. IS GOING ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS RECEIVING THEIR HEALTHCARE THEY SHOULD NOT. BE GETTING THREATS AND VIOLENCE THEY SHOULD BE SAFE AND SECURE AND I THINK THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL THING THIS BILL IS TRYING TO ADDRESS. LAWS REGULATING SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION ONLINE WERE LAST UPDATED IN THE MID TWO THOUSANDS THE FACE FACT PROTECTING CLINICS WAS WRITTEN IN. CONTRAST TO CLEAN MORE EXTREME IN THEIR TACTICS SOMETIMES USING ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY TO DO SO. PROTESTERS ARE HARASSING PATIENTS AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS WEARING THEM DOWN MENTALLY AND CONFRONTING THEM PHYSICALLY. NEW CAMERA VIDEO CAPABILITIES ALLOW THEM TO FILM PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS IN DETAIL THESE IMAGES WHICH ARE POSTED ON PUBLIC FACING WEBSITES LEAD TO HARASSMENT AND THE THREATENING OF PATIENTS LIVES OUR CURRENT LAW DOES NOT REFLECT THE SEVERITY OF THIS THREAT BECAUSE IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR. THE THREATS WERE DIFFERENT. LAW ENFORCEMENT IS DETERRED FROM MAKING ARRESTS POLICE ARE FRUSTRATED BY THE RELENTLESSNESS OF THESE GROUPS AND THEY LACK SUFFICIENT TRAINING TO ADDRESS THE FRAUGHT SITUATION. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE PRIVACY AND PHYSICAL SAFETY OR PRE REQUISITE. FOR ACCESSIBLE HEALTH CARE. WHEN A PATIENT FACES UNMITIGATED HARASSMENT IN ONE OF THEIR MOST VULNERABLE MOMENTS THEY'RE BEING ROBBED OF THAT RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE AND OUR LAWS ARE FAILING TO PROTECT THEM. HARASSING IN PHYSICAL VIOLENCE AGAINST REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH DOCTORS CARRIES LOWER PENALTIES THAN DOG FIGHTING. LOW FINDS IN MISDEMEANORS DON'T DETER GROUPS THAT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PAY AND DEFEND THEMSELVES AND WE'VE ACCEPTED THIS IS THE STATUS QUO ONE THAT OVER PENALIZES MARIJUANA POSSESSION BELIEVES YOUNG WOMEN VICTIMS OF DEATH THREATS FOR SEEKING HEALTH CARE UNPROTECTED. AB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX UPDATES ARE A LOT LAWS TO INCREASE FINES FOR ONLINE HARASSMENT INTENTIONALLY TERRORIZING PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS IT INCREASES PENALTIES FOR REPEAT AND VIOLENT OFFENSES IT ALSO INCLUDES THE NEEDED TRAINING FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ACTUALLY PROSECUTE THESE CRIMES AND PROTECT THESE PATIENTS AND WORKERS. THIS IS NOT ABOUT ARBITRARY PUNISHMENT IT'S ABOUT FINDING A SOLUTION THE PENALTIES THEREFORE WILL HAVE A THREE YEAR SUNSET IS THE CHAIRMAN CHEN- THAT WILL ALLOW US TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE LAWS IN DETERRING EXTREMISTS AND MAKE SURE WE ARE BEST PROTECTING PATIENTS AND WORKERS- AS NOTED NOT ONLY IS THERE SUNSET BUT THE BILL ALLOWS US TO COLLECT DATA ON HOW THIS IS WORKING SO AGAIN. YOU'LL SEE AYE I LOVE DATA SO THIS BILL TWO ALLOWS US TO KNOW HOW WE ARE PROTECTING THESE PATIENTS AND WORKERS TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX ISELIN SO LINDA VASQUEZ VICE PRESIDENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD LOS ANGELES AND JESSICA MORAN% THE DIRECTOR OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD ONE THE GREAT HEALTH CENTER. THAT HEALTH CENTER IN MY COMMUNITY WHERE WE HAVE SEEN VIOLENCE IN FRONT OF A HEALTH CENTER WHERE PEOPLE ARE JUST TRYING TO SEE CARE AND YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT WHAT THE PATIENTS AND DOCTORS ARE FACING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IT WITNESSES A SUPPORT CAN BEGIN WHENEVER THEY'RE READY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS YOU CAN IN THAT BASKET I AM HERE ON BEHALF OF. LANTERN HAD TALKED ANGELES INSTALLED SUPPORT. OF AB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX WE HAVE. VERY FOR VERY MANY YEARS DECADES HAVE EXPERIENCED- THE CURRENT NATION- THE- ANTI PLANNED PARENTHOOD EXTREMISTS- THAT HAVE TARGETED AND SIMPLY ATTACKED AND HARASSED I'M HERE KAREN HAD PATIENTS AND ARTS COUNCIL WORK FOR PROVIDERS AND VOLUNTEERS. UNFORTUNATELY IN THE LAST YEAR DURING THE PANDEMIC WHEN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE WAS ACTUALLY I'M STILL IN A STRONG DEMAND AND IT CONTINUES TO BE SO WE SAW AN INCREASE IN THESE ATTACKS. AGAINST PLANNED PARENTHOOD. I'M INTERESTED MONTHS WE ACTUALLY SAW A FEW OF THE LEADERS OF ANTI PLANNED PARENTHOOD ANTI ABORTION GROUPS INVOLVED IN THE INTERACTION ON THE U. S. CAPITOL. AND WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THERE HAD BEEN A LONG OVERLAP BETWEEN ANTI PLANNED PARENTHOOD EXTREMISTS AND WHITE SUPREMACISTS CURRENT TERRORIST MOVEMENTS. IT IS TROUBLING WHEN OUR PATIENT POPULATION IN PARTICULAR IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND CHAIR YOU KNOW THAT VERY WELL- AND YOU REPRESENT OUR HEADQUARTERS- IN NEAR USC AND IN SOUTH LA. WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN DIFFERENT STRATEGIES- USED AGAINST OUR PATIENTS AND AGAINST OUR ESSENTIAL WORK FORCE- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR FRIEND IS THAT THE LAWS HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE THE NINETIES WHAT WE REALLY HAVE TO ACCEPT THE COMPLACENCY AROUND WHAT IS HAPPENING. IN ON A DAILY BASIS OUTSIDE OF OUR HEALTH CENTERS- WE HAVE IN LOS ANGELES A FEW HEALTH CENTER- WE HAVE TWENTY ONE HEALTH CENTERS THAT SERVE OVER TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PATIENT DOES THAT OUR PATIENT POPULATION REFLECTS THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. PROXIMALLY 75% OF OUR PATIENTS. ARE PATIENTS OF COLOR. EIGHTY OVER ALMOST NINETY- ARE. PATIENTS THAT LIVE ATTY BELOW THE FEDERAL LEVEL. I DO ON A DAILY BASIS HAVE TO NAVIGATE BY RENTS THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY JUST HEARD IN THIS COMMITTEE- IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT WHEN THEY SPEAK REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE ARE FURTHER VICTIMIZED AND TERRORIZED. WE'VE ALSO HIRED EXPERIENCE SAYS- WHERE ARE THE PRIVACY OF OUR PROVIDERS ARE GETS CLOSE ONLINE. OF COURSE THE INFILTRATION OF A FEW YEARS AGO AND INFORMATION WHERE ARE PROVIDERS LIVE AND- HAVE HAD PROTESTERS OUTSIDE. OUR TOP PROVIDERS HOMES- WHERE THEIR FAMILY THEIR CHILDREN. AND- PARTNERS LEADS. WE CANNOT NOT UPDATE THESE LAWS ANYMORE WE WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE. UPDATING YES THAT THAT WHAT'S ON THE BOOKS TO PROTECT PATIENTS THAT SIMPLE WE JUST NEED REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE THEY JUST NEED HEALTHCARE THEY'RE COMING TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD EVERY SINGLE GAME WORKING DOING THE BEST THAT THEY CAN IN THEIR LIVES AND ON TOP OF JUST TRYING TO GET SIMPLE BASIC HEALTH CARE THEY'RE BEING TERRORIZED AND WE'VE SEEN ACTUALLY- SCHERING YOUR DISTRICT AN INCREASE WHICH COULD YOU AND GREEN WRAP UP THAT YOU'RE AT FOUR MINUTES. WE USUALLY GET BOTH WITNESSES OCTOBER. AFTER WILL WRAP THAT. WE JUST WANT TO BE HELD AT. AND WE WANT OUR PATIENTS TO ACCESS. HEALTH CARE WITHOUT ANY MORE BARRIERS AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR CONSIDERATIONS OF THIS FILM. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS BEST GUESS. YES THAT'S JUST IT I HAD A MORE INFRASTRUCTURE MARKSMAN. BACK UP AND GOOD AFTERNOON SHARING COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JESSICA MORAN AND I AM THE FOUNDER DIRECTOR- FOR THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND WALNUT CREEK I AM HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX. I HAVE BEEN WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS AND IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IT'S DIFFICULT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANAMAX. PROTESTERS AN INCIDENT AROUND PROTECTING HAVE ESCALATED TO AN ALL TIME HIGH. PATIENT DOCTOR FATE DALY WITH HARASSMENT AND INTIMIDATION. DURING THE PANDEMIC STOCK ALREADY FEEL THE PRESSURE OF PROVIDING CARE OF THE SOCIAL WORKERS. ADDING THE PRESSURE DAILY HARASSMENT MAKES STAFF FEEL UNSAFE ON SO MANY LEVELS. HAVING SOMEONE SCREAM AT YOU THAT YOU'RE A MURDERER AND HAVE BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS BEING CONFRONTED AND HAVING PEOPLE PHYSICALLY BLOCKED YOUR PATH. NO ONE SHOULD FEEL UNSAFE WHEN WALKING INTO THEIR PLACE OF WORK ABOUT OF WHAT MY STOCK BASED ON A DAILY BASIS THAT. THEY'RE ALSO MET WITH HATE AND ANGER FROM THE MOMENT THEY SHOW UP THEY ARE WITH- SHOW UP. THERE MET WITH SIDEWALKS COVERED WITH PROTESTERS. AND BERATING BEGAN. WHAT WE HAVE A VERY LARGE SPECTRUM OF PEOPLE THAT SPEAK HEALTH CARE WITHOUT MANY OF OUR PATIENTS ARE YOUNG PEOPLE. AND FROM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. SOME OF OUR PATIENTS HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO SEE CARE AND FAR TOO MANY LACK TRUST IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ALTOGETHER. EVERY DAY WE HAVE PATIENTS COMING INTO THE HEALTH CENTER AND TEARS DUE TO THE HARASSMENT THEY FACE ON THE WAY AND TO HELP BETTER. BEING SCREENED OUT TO STOP KILLING THEIR BABIES. ONE PATIENT CAME IN PHYSICALLY SHAKING STATING THAT SHE WAS TOLD EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS RAPED HER ACTION TO ABORT ON JACK AND SHE WOULD PAY. PUNISHED SHE WOULD BE PUNISHED FOR HER SPEND. I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PICTURES AND VIDEOS BEING TAKEN OF THEM TEARING UP THEIR CONFIDENTIALITY AND RIGHT TO PRIVACY IS BEING VIOLATED. IN EXTREME CASES SOME PATIENTS ARE FELT THREATENED AND INTIMIDATED THEY LEAVE BEFORE GETTING THE CARE THEY ARE SPEAKING AND NEEDS. THIS IS A HUGE BARRIER FOR PATIENTS TO ACCESS CARE SAFELY AND EXERT THEIR BODILY AUTONOMY. GRANDPARENT HAVE BEEN A LONG TARGET OF PROTESTERS AND ANTI ABORTION CAMPAIGN. BUT IN THE PAST YEARS THINGS HAVE ESCALATED BEYOND CONTROL AND WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT. OUR PATIENTS DESERVE TO RECEIVE HEALTHCARE WITHOUT INTIMIDATION AND ARE HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND DOCTORS. SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE CARE WITHOUT THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE. FOR THESE REASONS I STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT ON AB. THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM. UP IN SUPPORT. SHE NONE ANY WITNESSES ON THE VIDEO SCREEN INSTEAD SUPPORT. AT&amp;T OPERATOR ME WE GO TO THE LINE. TELEPHONE LINES.

THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU WE HAVE A WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MATTHEW MAKE RUNNELS AND KATHY SURE ACLU AND- PACIFIC JUSTICE INSTITUTE. GOOD AFTERNOON- KATHY SHARP FOR ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION- WE OF COURSE SHARE THE GOAL OF- MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IS NOT INTERFERED WITH. AND I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH US ON THE CONCERNS WE HAVE RAISED REGARDING THE BILL- WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ARE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING DISCUSSION. FOR NOW HOWEVER WE REMAIN IN OPPOSITION FIRST WE BELIEVE THE INCREASED PENALTIES PROPOSED IN THE BILL- EVEN AS AMENDED OUR MISGUIDED RESPONSE TO THE PROBLEM THE BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS. OFFENDERS WHO ARE NOT DETERRED BY THE EXISTING PUNISHMENTS PROVIDED UNDER LAW WILL NOT BE DETERRED BY THESE PROPOSED INCREASE TERMS OF INCARCERATION AND INCREASED FINE. WE BELIEVE THE PROPOSED LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING ALSO INCLUDED IN THE BILL IS A FAR MORE EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO ENSURE THAT THE EXISTING MARKETS. PROPERLY FORCE. SECOND THE BILL RATE CONCERN WITH THE TO CREE OF PANEL THAT ARE APPLICABLES PROTECTED EXPRESSIVE CONDUCT WELL THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT THIRTY SEVEN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE BELIEVE FURTHER WORK IS NEEDED I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO FIND A WAY TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE PROTECTIONS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CENTER. WELL RESPECTING THE CIVIL LIBERTIES OF THOSE ENGAGING IN PROTEST ACTIVITY. AGAIN WE THANK THE AUTHOR AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH HIM AGAIN WELL. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON THAT MATTHEW MCREYNOLDS HERE CAN YOU HEAR ME OK SURE CAN. THANK YOU- ON BEHALF- PACIFIC YET YES INSTITUTE AND THE CENTER FOR PUBLIC POLICY- I DID JUST WANT TO SAY A COUPLE OF QUICK THINGS FIRST OF ALL IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT WE AS A CONSERVATIVE LEANING CONSTITUTIONAL GROUP FIND OURSELVES IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE- ACLU ON A BILL LIKE THIS BUT I THINK THAT JUST DEMONSTRATES. THE BREADTH AND THE DEPTH OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE LEGISLATION- THE- BILL LEGISLATION AS NOTED BY THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS- SKATE. CLOSE TO THE LAW. OR WE WOULD ARGUE ACROSS THE LINE IN A NUMBER OF AREAS ONE BEING THE PROPER SET UP. AND THAT COMMITTEE ANALYSIS HAS ATTEMPTED TO DISTINGUISH THAT FROM DECISION SUCH AS MCCARTY COAKLEY- I THINK THAT ANYBODY WHO LOOKS AT THE CURRENT MEMBERSHIP OF THE U. S. SUPREME COURT. WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE INCLINED TO MAKE THOSE KIND OF A SUPER FINE DISTINCTIONS BUT AT A MORE FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL. WHAT THE BILL DIES IS. WRESTLING THAT ALL OF THE THREATS THE INTIMIDATION THE VIOLIN OR A ONE DIRECTIONAL THAT THEY'RE ALL DIRECTED. AT THE CLINIC STAFF WORKERS PATIENTS AND NEVER AT THOSE WHO- PRAY AND PLEAD ANNA TIMES PROTESTS OUTSIDE OF CLINICS WE REPRESENT MANY SUCH INDIVIDUALS. THEY CONDEMN VIOLENCE THREATS AND INTIMIDATION BUT THIS BILL DOES NOTHING FOR THEM. I ACTUALLY THINK IT MAKES IT BLATANTLY VIEWPOINT DISCRIMINATORY AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL. AND LASTLY I DO SAY THAT WE OFTEN ADVISE OUR CLIENTS IN ORDER TO ENSURE FAIRNESS AND ENSURE THEIR OWN DEFENSE IN THE EVENT THAT THEY'RE BROUGHT INTO COURT. TO VIDEO OR RECORD THEMSELVES WHILE THEY'RE OUTSIDE OF CLINICS NOT FOR THE PURPOSES OF HAASSMENT OR INTIMIDATION BUT AND SO THAT- THEY CAN PREVENT FALSE ACCUSATIONS. THIS BILL WOULD BRING IN THAT KIND OF CONDUCT CHANGER IS SOLELY IN TO CONDUCT IT COULD BE CRIMINALIZED SO FOR ALL THOSE IN THE ADDITIONAL REASONS OPPOSITION LETTER. WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESS IN THECHAMBER IN OPPOSITION ANY ON THE VIDEO SCREEN IN OPPOSITION AND WE WILL NOW AT&amp;T OPEN UP THE- DOOR FOR TELEPHONE LINES FOR OPPOSITION FOR AB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION- OF AB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONCE AGAIN SIR OPPOSITION- AB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. I CURRENTLY HAVE TWO COMMENTS THANK YOU WILL GO TO Y. NINETY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. MARCO GEORGE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION WE THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE REMAIN OPPOSED AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL RIGHT NINETY NINE. BY NINETY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI MY NAME IS MARINO DELLO I'M FROM BAKERSFIELD CALIFORNIA AND I'M WITH LIKE MINISTRY IS LIKE WHEN IS TO LIVE A COALITION MADE UP OF KERN COUNTY CATHOLIC CHURCHES. IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO AB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX AND IN ADDITION I WOULD LIKE TO STATE THAT I AM ALSO- THANK YOU. WHAT WHAT WHAT OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME OKAY WE'LL BRING YOU BACK TO COMMITTEE AND ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS WHEN THE START WAS LACKING SURE. LISTEN I DON'T EVER SUPPORT. HARASSMENT OR INAPPROPRIATE DERISION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ENGAGED IN SUCH A- VERY PERSONAL MATTER HOWEVER. I FIND AND I THINK YOU KNOW I HAVE KIND OF TOUCHED ON THIS PARTICULAR. ASPECT I BELIEVE THAT THESE PROVISIONS OF PENALTIES DO NOT PROTECT PRO LIFE INSTITUTIONS OF PEOPLE GOING ON THE OTHER SIDE BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE. A PROBLEM ON THAT END AS WELL AND SO. BECAUSE THIS IS AN BALLOTS TOWARDS ONLY. ONE SIDE OF THE- THE EQUATION I FIND IT TO BE UNSUPPORTABLE AT THIS POINT UNLESS YOU TOOK AN AMENDMENT TO ACTUALLY- PROTECT PRO LIFE- INSTITUTIONS AS WELL. DID YOU WANT INTERACTION THANK YOU- SO THANK YOU MR LACKEY AND I KNOW THAT WE BOTH SHARE THE DESIRE TO PROTECT EVERYBODY WHO'S GOING ABOUT THEIR LAWFUL BUSINESS IN SAFETY AND SECURITY- WHETHER WE AGREE WITH WHAT THEY'RE DOING OR NOT- I APOLOGIZE TO THE MAN WHO TESTIFIED IN OPPOSITION I CAN'T REMEMBER I'M YOUR NAME BUT THE SECOND GENTLEMAN WHO I THINK SPOKE TO WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND THE LACK OF IT BEING YOU POINT NEUTRAL I WOULD ARGUE THAT I MEAN JUST IN OUR BODY ALONE THERE ARE. DEFINITELY WOMEN WHO ARE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH PATIENTS WHO DON'T SHARE MY POSITION ON CHOICE. AND THEY WOULD BE PROTECTED BY THIS AS WELL. AND THERE ARE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH WORKERS WHO. WORK TO PROVIDE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES TO I BELIEVE DON'T PROVIDE ABORTIONS THAT ARE PROTECTED BY THIS. SO IN THAT WAY I BELIEVE IT IS YOU POINT NEUTRAL WE'RE PROTECTING A CERTAIN CLASS OF PEOPLE BUT IT IS NOT. FOR US OR FOR THE LAW TO SAY WHETHER THOSE PEOPLE ARE. ABORTION PROVIDERS OR NOT OR WHETHER THOSE WOMEN WHO ARE SEEKING CARE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE ARC SEEKING ABORTIONS OR NOT OR WHETHER THEY EVER WOULD- AND SO I THINK THIS BILL FOCUSES ON A CLASS OF PEOPLE WHO. ARE CURRENTLY BEING THREATENED BUT IT BY NO MEANS SPEAKS TO THE VIEW POINT OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND I WANT THAT TO BE REALLY REALLY CLEAR AND I DO BELIEVE. AND IT IS YOU POINT NEUTRAL AND THAT WAY ALTHOUGH NARROW IN SCOPE I DO BELIEVE THAT IT FOCUSES. JUST ON WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SPACE AND THE- COMPLETE- DIVISION AND WHERE WE HAVE GOTTEN WHO IS A SOCIETY THAT. IN THIS BODY I HAVE PEOPLE WHO DON'T AGREE WITH ME ON CHOICE AND WE HAVE. DIALOGUE ABOUT THAT AND I WANT TO ADDRESS WITH THE ACLU SAID AS WELL WHICH IS WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM TO ENSURE THAT CIVIL LIBERTIES ARE PROTECTED I BELIEVE IN THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT I BELIEVE PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO EXPRESS THEIR FIRST MEMBER RIGHT. I DO NOT BELIEVE THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO CROSS THE LINE AND ASSAULT THREATEN OR CAUSE HARM TO INDIVIDUALS AND THERE IS A LINE AND WE'LL WORK TO MAKE SURE WERE THERE BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT- MATTER YOUR VIEWPOINT YOU CANNOT CROSS THAT LINE IN A MATTER OF YOU POINT OF THOSE WERE BEING SUBJECT OF THIS BEHAVIOR. THEY DESERVE TO BE PROTECTED. MISTER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AS SOMEONE ON THIS DAIS WHO HAS WALKED INTO A PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINIC ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION I HAVE RECEIVED HEALTH CARE THERE I RECEIVED ANNUAL EXAMS THERE I'VE ALSO RECEIVED AN ABORTION AT A PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINIC WHICH I'VE SPOKEN ABOUT PUBLICLY ON THE FLOOR I HAVE WALKED THROUGH- YOU KNOW PROTESTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS AND EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO PROTEST I'M- I PARTICIPATINGHOTELS ALL THE TIME. BUT WHAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO IS TO THREATEN INTIMIDATE AND POTENTIALLY CAUSE VIOLENCE OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE SEEKING TO GET THE HEALTH CARE THAT THEY NEED AND- IT IS IN THAT MOMENT OF TIME ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE TRYING TO MAKE THIS VERY TOUGH DECISION AS I HAVE MADE IN MY LIFE. WHEN YOU ESPECIALLY SHOULDN'T BE SUBJECT TO THAT TYPE OF INTIMIDATION OR THREAT OF VIOLENCE. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT WOMEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE HEALTHCARE THAT THEY THAT THEY I BELIEVE IS A FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT. IN A SAFE PLACE. THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY OF THAT DECISION AND FOR THEIR IMAGES NOT TO BE. PUBLISHED ON THE INTERNET WHEN THEY'RE MAKING A VERY PRIVATE DECISION- AND FOR THAT REASON I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I THINK THE AUTHOR HAS WORKED VERY HARD. TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS. THAT THE OPPOSITION IS RACE AND I WILL TELL YOU I OFTEN VOTE WITH THE OPPOSITION. IF YOU LOOK AT MY VOTING RECORD I'VE RARELY VOTE TO INCREASE PENALTIES BUT I THINK WITH THIS BILL DOES IS IT MODERNIZES WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN REAL LIFE. IN OUR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH- CARE FACILITIES- AND SO AND I AND I ALSO TRUST THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS I KNOW THAT SHE WILL- AND SO IS WITH THAT REASON I WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS BILL TODAY. I I'M OF THE BILL SECOND. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THIS RICH DIALOGUE AGAIN AND THE WHOLE COMMITTEES ENGAGEMENT ON THIS SUBJECT I KNOW THE RAISING PENALTIES ISN'T AN EASY THING FOR MANY PEOPLE ON THIS COMMITTEE TO DO AND I KNOW THAT AND PEOPLE WHO DON'T AGREE WITH ME ALWAYS ON CHOICE OF WORKS HARD TO CONSIDER WHETHER THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S A PART OF AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF THAT. YOU KNOW I TRULY APPRECIATE THE OPEN DIALOGUE THAT WE HAVE THE COMMITTEE ON WHERE WE CAN FIND COMMON GROUND WHETHER BE SOMEONE WHO RARELY SUPPORTS REYES PENALTIES OR SOMEONE WHO REALLY SUPPORTS ANTIQUES THE PROTECTION OF THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE- AND BUT I JUST REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON THESE WOMEN. AND WORKERS WHETHER THEY BE MEN OR WOMEN ALTHOUGH THE VAST MAJORITY ARE PROBABLY WOMEN WHO WALK INTO THESE CLINICS- TO GET HEALTH CARE AND SOMETIMES IT'S FOR ABORTION AND SOMETIMES IT'S FOR CANCER SCREENINGS OR OTHER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE THAT WE ALL AGREE IS NECESSARY AND IN SO DOING THEY ARE THREATENS WE HAVE LAWS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND NATIONALLY TO PROTECT OUR PRIVACY RUN HEALTHCARE THE DAY WHEN I GO INTO THE DOCTOR NOBODY GETS TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT ROOM AND YET PEOPLE ARE FILMING. THESE WOMEN IN PUTTING THAT ON THE INTERNET AND VIOLATING THOSE LAWS THAT WE HAVE ALL SUPPORTED I BELIEVE TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF PATIENTS- AND THAT IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY IS PROTECTING PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING HEALTH CARE AND PROTECTING PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING ABOUT LAW ABIDING ACTIVITIES ENSURING THEY CAN DO SO IN SAFETY AND SECURITY AND I BELIEVE THAT WE ALL. AND WE ALL SUPPORT THAT AND I JUST LOOK FORWARD TO MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD CONTINUING TO LOOK AT A SPACE WHERE WE CAN HAVE PROTESTERS WHO HAVE A RIGHT TO PROTEST IN THE WAY THAT OUR CONSTITUTION PROTECTS AND ALSO HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE ABLE TO GET THE REPRODUCTIVE CARE THEY DESERVE IN THE WAY THEY DESERVE AND I THINK BOTH CAN HAPPEN SIMULTANEOUSLY WITHOUT THE THREATS WE ARE TRYING TO PREVENT HERE. THANK YOU ARE STRICTLY ASK FOR ABBOTT. AND THANK YOU AT THE YOU FOR TRYING TO WORK WITH THE CA. ON YOU AND I'VE- WITH THIS. AND JUST. FOR ME THIS IS THIS IS LIKE A GRAND EXPERIMENT FOR ME. AS WELL WITH A THREE YEAR SUNSET- I PERSONALLY DON'T BELIEVE. ANY OF THESE. INCREASES IN PENALTIES WILL HELP. I TOLD YOU THAT I TOLD YOU THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT. MAY SAY THAT THEY NEED FAMILIES. BUT THEY WANT TO JUST THROW EVERYBODY IN JAIL- WHEN WAS THAT WHEN IT WAS A BROKEN WINDOW. MISDEMEANORS WERE WORKED ON THE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES LIKE CRAZY AND THEY DID MISDEMEANORS AND A LOT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE. NOW I WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE NOW HAVE MISTER MUSIC INTERNET TO FELONIES. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT OF COLOR WHICH IS MOST OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE OUT THERE WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTUALLY DOES WHAT THEY TOLD YOU THEY WOULD DO. IF WE INCREASE THE PENALTIES ON THE EVE REPRODUCTIVE AGENCIES THAT THEY WOULD MAKE SURE YOU HAD YOUR BUFFER ZONES THAT YOU KEEP YOUR PEOPLE SAFE AND MOST IMPORTANT THAT THEY WOULD GO AHEAD AND REST PEOPLE ON MISDEMEANORS AND SO YOUR SECOND CHALLENGE OBVIOUSLY IS THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF IT. AND WHAT WHAT BOTHERS ME IS I NEVER GOT AN ANSWER FROM THE ACLU. THAT I WON IT BEFORE THIS AND SO HOPEFULLY YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH GETTING THEIR- THEIR OPINION ON THIS BECAUSE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. OFF ON THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF IT. IT IS NOT UP. IT REALLY IS NOT UP TO LAW ENFORCEMENT ASIDE IF THE PENALTIES IMPOSED FOR A PARTICULAR CRIME A STRONG ENOUGH. RATHER LAW ENFORCEMENT IS TASKED WITH ENFORCING THE LOS. PASSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE WITHOUT PREJUDICE THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. AND YOU CAN NOT PICK OUT A CERTAIN GROUP YOU CANNOT DECIDE WHICH ONES YOU CAN AND CANNOT DO BECAUSE ALL THESE LAWS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO PROTECTING EVERYONE IN THE SYSTEM. AND- WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT WITH THIS BILL. IF IT PASSES AND GET THROUGH WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT WITH THE DATA THAT YOU COLLECT. HOW MANY PEOPLE. PROBABLY MOSTLY NOT OF COLOR THAT ACTUALLY GET. FIND OR GOTTEN DONE ON THESE FOR GOING AFTER REPRODUCTIVE AGENCIES IN A LAWFUL MANNER WE WILL FIND OUT FAIRLY QUICKLY. HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT DEALS WITH. THESE TYPES A LOT OF I HOPE THEY'RE VERY EFFECTIVE I HOPE THEY THEY WORK WITH YOU I HOPE THAT THEY CREATE A POP STAR OKAY MAKE ALL THESE THEM SAFE BUT I AM SKEPTICAL BUT I'M ALSO WILLING. TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY THIS PRESENTS IS NARROW IN FOCUS VERY VERY NARROW AND WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE WHAT THE DATA SHOWS- ULTIMATELY OF. WHEN WE WORK TOGETHER. WERE ABLE TO GET TO THAT WERE NOT WORKING TOGETHER. IT THE WHOLE THING FALLS APART SO- GOOD LUCK AS YOU MOVE FORWARD TO CHECK RECOMMENDED I BOOKED. I'M AB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX BY SEVEN MEMBER BARRACK HE HAD THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER HI BLACKIE BLACKIE KNELT BARRICADE HANAI BARRICADE HAD A CORK BY CORK I SANTIAGO. C. R. TO KNOW THEIR TURNOUT WICKS WICKS HI LEE. LEE I. THE MEASURE PASSES. MR MCCARTY FOR THE LAST BILL. MY LAST BILL. OKAY DID NOT KNOW. THANK YOU FOR YOUR- PATIENCE MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS- I ALSO WANT TO MISTER CHAIR THINK HERE YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US WE DIDN'T ALWAYS SEE EYE TO EYE OUT ON THIS ISSUE IN IN COMING BEFORE US TODAY. BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE THEM TRENER STAND WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM. AS IT ALSO POINTS OUT I HAD BEFORE OUT A DISTRICT BILL FOR MYSELF AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER-AGUIAR-CURRY IT'S A DISTRICT BILL FOR YOLO COUNTY. OFFERING A PILOT PROJECT TO CREATE THE HOPE YOU'LL- SECURED RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR INDIVIDUALS SUFFERING FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED. OF DRUG RELATED FELONIES TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO NOT GO TO JAIL OR PRISON BUT INSTEAD GET TREATMENT FOR THEIR ADDICTION AND HOPEFULLY GET ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY- THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM AGAIN ANOTHER PIZZA PLACE IN. A DEBATE ABOUT THAT THESE ARE FOR I KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF OUR CAN'T JUST LAUGH ASK WHAT KIND OF FELONIES THERE'S ARE NONVIOLENT FELONIES NO TO NINETIES NOPE- SEX CRIMES THESE ARE FELONIES RELATED TO. A DRUG ADDICTION I WE DO KNOW THAT- THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING LOOK AT ANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES WE HAVE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO GET. ARRESTED FOR- A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT ARE RELATED TO THEIR DRUG ADDICTION AND NEVER GET TREATMENT WE HAVE AN AN EXAMPLE ARE. ARE ARE ARE WITH THIS IS GONNA TALK ABOUT INDIVIDUALS ARRESTED HERE IN YOLO COUNTY NEARLY TWENTY TIMES AT A LOCAL TARGET. FOR THEFT AND- AND OTHER INCIDENTS RELATED TO HIS DRUG ADDICTION AND NEVER WENT AND GOT TREATMENT. SO THIS WOULD PROVIDE A- CHOICE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO GET TREATMENT AS OPPOSED TO INCARCERATION- IT ALSO ALLOWED THE VIGILS TO GET. A A- AN EXPUNGEMENT OF THEIR OF THEIR RECORD FOR THE RATE TO THEIR FELONIES- YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S EVIDENCE BAY. UPON TO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM SOME OTHERS AS WELL WE KNOW THAT- THE SECURED FACILITIES ACTUALLY DO WORK AND SOME PEOPLE SOMETIMES HAVE TO HIT ROCK BOTTOM. AND THIS IS BEEN OPPORTUNITY PEOPLE TO CHOOSE TREATMENT OVER INCARCERATION BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT INCARCERATION IS NOT THE BEST PLACE FOR PEOPLETRYING TO KICK A DRUG ADDICTION. WE ALL KNOW OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LOST TO THE STREETS. WHO ARE WE. ARE DESPERATE- O TRY TO DO A DIFFERENT THEIR ADDICTION. AND RIGHT NOW OUR. COURTS AND OUR DEFENDER COULD NOT JUST SYSTEM. OUR HANDS ARE TIED WITH LACK OF OUR ARE COURTS ESSENTIALLY WORKING- WE DID SOMETHING. THIS IS WHY THIS IS A PIE PROJECT WHICH I. OUR COUNT HERE NEXT DOOR IN YELLOW. FOR FIFTY YEARS FOUR THREE THREE AND HALF YEARS% UP TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. TO COME TOGETHER AND COME UP WITH A. SOLUTION I THINK CAN POTENTIALLY BE. WRAPPED MUSIC CALIFORNIA. THIS ALLOWS US TO GET OUT FRONT OF THIS ISSUE AND NOT. AND NOT WAIT AROUND WHILE MORE- LIVES ARE RUINED. WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY. OUR JEFF REISIG. THE DA FROM YOLO COUNTY AND DOUG THAT EXACT DIRECTOR FROM FOURTH AND HOPE TO. FOR THANK YOU THANK YOU. GENTLEMAN WHO WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS RETURNING UPRIGHT AND YOU'LL COUNTY. NOW TO ME PEOPLE WHO FOR SERIOUS OF TO SO ARE GOING TO PRISONS AND JAILS FOR CRIMES THAT ARE MOTIVATED BY THEIR ADDICTION- IN PRISONS AND JAILS ARE SIMPLY NOT PLACES WHERE PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK. GO TO GET BETTER AS YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER STATED WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WORKING I'VE SEEN THAT FIRST HAND. TWENTY FIVE YEARS AS A PROSECUTOR. HAS THE REFERENCE WE HAVE PEOPLE BEEN ARRESTED DOZENS OF TIMES. UP FOR BURGLARY AND AUTO THEFT AND OTHER CRIMES WHO ARE JUST NOT GETTING HELP IN THE SYSTEM. AB. FIFTEEN FORTY. WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF A FELONY LEVEL CRIMES THAT ARE MOTIVATED BY THEIR SERIOUS ADDICTION TO DRUGS. BUT WHO KNOWS TO MUCH RISK FOR A JUDGE. TO SIMPLY RELEASE THEM INTO AN UNSECURED RESIDENTIAL FACILITY IN THE COMMUNITY. WHERE THEY CAN SIMPLY WALK AWAY OR CRAWL OUT A WINDOW ONE DAY ONE. AND POTENTIALLY CAUSE MORE HARM TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS. SO INSTEAD AB FIFTEEN FORTY TWO ENVISIONS CREATING A SECURE HOSPITAL LIKE TREATMENT ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT JAILS IN BARS AND GUARDS AND GUNS. THAT CAN SERVE AS A SANCTUARY. FOR SERIOUSLY ADDICTED FELONY OFFENDERS. WHO VOLUNTARILY CHOOSE TO TRY LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES IN A SAFE AND SECURE SETTING RIGHT HERE AT HOME. INSTEAD OF BEING SHIPPED OFTEN WAREHOUSE BEHIND BARS. WE'RE CALLING THIS PLACE THIS POTENTIAL PLACE HOPE YELLOW. WOULD ALSO MAKE THIS TREATMENT ALTERNATIVE UNIQUE IS IT'LL BE DESIGNED AND STAFFED BY TREATMENT PROVIDERS AND THEY WILL DECIDE. WHO IS AN APPROPRIATE CANDIDATE AND WHO IS NOT AND ALSO DECIDE WHAT THE TREATMENT LOOKS LIKE. FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO SUCCESSFULLY CHOOSE. AND COMPLETE THE TREATMENT OVER PRISON OR JAIL THEY WILL HAVE THEIR CONVICTIONS CONVICTIONS EXPUNGED. AGAIN WE GET A CLEAN START RIGHT HERE INYO COUNTY. SO ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW AB FIFTEEN FORTY TWO IS A VERY MEASURED PILOT BILL JUST HEARING YOU A LITTLE THAT IS DESIGNED TO OFFER VOLUNTARY TREATMENT ALTERNATIVES. THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY ON THEIR WAY TO PRISON OR JAIL SO THIS IS ANOTHER DOOR THAT THEY CAN CHOOSE. WE'VE DONE A PRELIMINARY REVIEW OF FILES FROM TWENTY TWENTY AND WE EASILY IDENTIFIED APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE. WHO WERE SENT TO PRISON OR JAIL FOR DRUG MOTIVATED CRIMES WHO COULD HAVE QUALIFIED. FOR THIS TYPE OF TREATMENT THAT HOPE KILL IF THEY WANTED IT- SO I WOULD URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO GIVE THIS PILOT PROGRAM A CHANCE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT. ROOF HELLO NEXT.

GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS TIRING DEPICTED COUNTY VEHICLE CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION EACH YEAR REPRESENTS THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY AND CITY PAPER HOW GORDY PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS CERTIFICATE HELLO INCOME CALIFORNIANS DRAMATIC ALLEN OTHER FUNDING STREAMS. EBITA THEN PRESS BACK OPPOSITION TO AB FIFTEEN FORTY TWO WHICH WOULD CREATE A LOCKSTEP IN THIS ORDER PROGRAM IN YELLOW COUNTY COMPULSORY YOUR COURSE TO STD TREATMENT IS NOT AN EFFECTIVE MEANS OF PROMOTING POSITIVE CLINICAL OUTCOMES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS OFFERING LOCKED FRIEDMAN AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO INCARCERATION WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL BUT NOT OTHERWISE EXPECT TREATMENT OUTSIDE OF THIS SITUATION. CAN FOSTER DISTRUST BETWEEN TREATMENT PROVIDERS AND CLIENTS AND REYES OVERDOSE REST PROBYN INDIVIDUALS TO LIKE WE ARE BY THE UNLIKELY TO SEEK OUT HELP IN THE FUTURE IN A STUDY OF THE NORTH CAROLINA PRISON SYSTEM IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS AFTER RELEASE FORMER INMATES. POPULATION INDIVIDUALS UPON BRUMBIES HAVE LACKED TOLERANCE TO THE FACTS AND THEN PRIOR TO INCARCERATION WE BELIEVE THE SECURED RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM WHICH FUNCTION SIMILARLY WITH AN INCREASED RISK OF DEATH BY OVERDOSE IT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE PUBLIC SAFETY IN A TIME WHEN CALIFORNIANS ARE EXPERIENCING HIGHER THAN AVERAGE RATES OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND OVERDOSE DEATHS DUE TO THE IMPACT OF CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. MARICAO COULD NOT BE UTILIZED FOR THAT SECURED PRESIDENTIAL PROGRAM WHICH IS THE KEY FUNDING STREAM IN CALIFORNIA FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES. MEDIC COW IS FEDERALLY RESTRICTED TO PAY FOR SERVICES BEEN INCARCERATED SETTING ADDITIONALLY CALIFORNIA AFTER A DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM WAVER HAS DEVELOPED AN EVIDENCE BASED SYSTEM OF CARE AND TREATMENT WITH GUIDELINES DEVELOPED BY THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR ADDICTION MEDICINE APPEARANCE THE DAVENANT'S BASE STANDARDS IS REQUIRED FOR RESIDENTIAL FACILITY LICENSURE. AND FOR MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT UNDER TìM COD AT A SECURED RESIDENTIAL SETTING IT'S NOT ONE OF THE- EVIDENCE BASED STANDARDS UNDER FEDERAL- BATIC OUR STANDARD WITHOUT MEDICARE FUNDING THIS PROGRAM WOULD REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL NEW INVESTMENTS THAT COULD BE UTILIZED FOR I'M- MORE EFFECTIVE INVESTMENT THE PHD A RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NO VOTE ON. EIGHTY FIFTEEN FORTY THREE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT AFTER MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS IS JOHN RATE HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH THANK YOU FOR OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON AND WE STRONGLY OPPOSE AB FIFTEEN FORTY TWO ON APPRECIATED SEVEN NUMBER MCCARTY INTENTION WITH THIS BILL. WE BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE PROVIDING DRUG TREATMENT TO THOSE IN NEED HOWEVER. INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT ESPECIALLY IN A JAIL LIKE LOCKS DISABILITY AS PROPOSED BY AB FIFTEEN FORTY TWO IS THE WRONG APPROACH. THERE'S A VARIETY OF PROBLEMS WITH THIS PROPOSED PILOT THE PRECEDING SPEAKERS CULTURE UP SEVERAL OF THEM I WOULD ADD VIEWS OF RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS MAKING HEALTHCARE DECISIONS THE LACK OF DUE PROCESS AND STANDARDS GUIDING JUDGES DISCRETION. WANT TO SPEAK. MOST DIRECTLY TO THE OVERALL PROMISE OF THE DETAILING OF THE PILOT PROGRAM. SO FIRST AT HOME WERE CALLING FOR ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION. IT AB FIFTY FOUR FIFTEEN FORTY TWO WHICH IS PROPOSING MORE A LOCKED FACILITY. NOT ACTUALLY DECRIMINALIZE ATION THIS IS TURNING HEALTH CARE INTO INCARCERATION. SECOND DESPITE THE AMENDED LANGUAGE AND AGAIN APPRECIATING THE INTENT WOULD. LANGUAGE AND THE LANGUAGE YOU USE WORDS LIKE CONSENT INVOLUNTARY. HOW IT WILL COERCE PEOPLE INTO TREATMENT. THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER DESCRIBED GENERALLY HAVE TO BE READY TO EMBRACE TREATMENT FOR TO WORK STUDIES- YOU NOT SHOW POSITIVE OUTCOMES FROM INVOLUNTARY TREAT. THE TREATMENT REQUIRES TRUSTING. BETWEEN PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS WHERE THIS PILOT A LOUSE PROBATION OFFICERS PROSECUTORS AND JUDGES TO INTERFERE WITH THAT RELATIONSHIP. THE RIGHT TO FREE AND INFORMED CONSENT INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO REFUSE TREATMENT IS ESSENTIAL. THE VOLUNTARY MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. WHILE IT'S NOT RIGHT. EMENDED LANGUAGE DOESN'T CHANGE THIS PILOT'S COURSE OF NATURE. THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY IN CALIFORNIA COURTS FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS. NEARLY ALL CASES IN OUR COURTS MISSTATING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY FOR THAT MATTER ARE RESOLVED BY PLEA BARGAINS. THIS POLITICIAN PROSECUTOR YOU GONNA SET WE THINK YOU NEED TREATMENT. IF YOU DON'T AGREE TO IT THEN WILL LOCK YOU IN PRISON FOR A LONG TIME. SHOULD BE A CUTE PERSONAL JUST GIVE N. GO TO THE LOCK TREATMENT FACILITY WITHIN THEIR READY OR WILLING TO CONSENTING ON. IT ENDS UP BEING ALL ABOUT WHO IS LEVERAGING THE COURTS NOT ABOUT THE INFORMED CONSENT WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR REAL HEALTHCARE. NOTHING TO LIVE ON ABOUT. DO YOU NEED TO INVEST IN TREATMENT FOR PEOPLE WITH PROBLEMATIC SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS WE NEED TO MAKE A WIDESPREAD MAKE IT EFFECTIVE AND MAKE IT NOT PART OF THE SYSTEM HONESTLY. WE REJECTED STILL LET'S ALL WORK TOGETHER TO EXPAND VOLUNTARY TREATMENT OPTIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. BUT ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES ANOTHER.

GOOD AFTERNOON OAKLAND BAPTIST THE ELEVATOR CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU GLENN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU WE NOW BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS. OR MR LACKEY MISS WICKS. YEAH LET ME JUST SAY- A COUPLE THINGS REAL QUICKLY- GROGAN ACTION. IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN THE STATE AND I THINK WE'VE LEARNED A GREAT DEAL FROM. PAST TRAGEDIES AT LEAST I'VE- I'VE INVOLVED ON THIS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CALL THEM ALL BUT AT LEAST THAT CHANGED- AND THAT I HAVE. REALLY COME TO GRIPS WITH THE FACT THAT- DRUG ADDICTION IS REALLY A MEDICAL ISSUE- AND IN MANY CASES I THINK IT'S NOT AND OVER CHOICE I THINK MAYBE SOME OTHER. FOUR CHOICES LED TO ADDICTIONS BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT THE POINT IS ONCE THEY'RE IN A DETECTIVE STATE. THESE FOLKS NEED I HAVE THEY NEED HELP. AND I KNOW THERE WAS A CLAIM THAT- PUSHING PEOPLE INTO TREATMENT AS A INEFFECTIVE AND MY OBSERVATIONS OF MY LIFE EXPERIENCE SAY JUST THE OPPOSITE THAT- I KNOW VERY FEW PEOPLE THAT HAVE SUCCESSFULLY BEATEN ADDICTION THE WORK PUSHED AND PUSHED VERY HARD. TO THE POINT OF DISCOMFORT. AND I KNOW THAT THOUGH WHEN. A LOT OF THIS THE PROVISIONS. THAT THE DIVERSION OFFERED. AND MANY OTHER ARREST SITUATIONS THAT I OBSERVED- THEY TOOK AWAY. THE MANDATORY DRUG TREATMENT AND WHEN THEY DID THAT THE DIVERSION PARTICIPATION FELL OFF PRECIPITOUSLY. AND UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THAT LED TO- TREATMENT. THAT NEVER TOOK PLACE SO I- I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL BUT I I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT. IT FILLS A GAP THAT IS VERY VERY CLEAR. THE WE NEED A REMEDY AND WHEN YOU HAVE. YOU KNOW THIS PROPOSAL TO BE STUDIED TO BE OBSERVED LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS AND I THINK THAT IT'S GONNA PROVE IF IT'S CARRIED OUT. OF THE WAY I UNDERSTAND IT. SOME LIVES ARE GOING TO BE FIXED. AND I THINK THAT THE- THAT'S POWERFULLY IMPORTANT I THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO LEARN FROM THIS PROVISION AND- I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT. YES THIS WORKS. THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR- JUST SOME QUESTIONS HERE- HAS A PILOT LIKE THIS BEEN DONE ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY YOU KNOW MR MCCARTY. NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE THAT'S WHY WE'RE ATTEMPTING HERE CALIFORNIA'S A PILOT AS OPPOSED TO A STATEWIDE AFTER I DID ATTEMPT TO COME UP WITH A BILL TWO YEARS AGO LOOKING THE SAME IDEA. STATEWIDE REVIEW THE BETTER OFF TO START SMALLER SMALL COUNTY LIKE YOLO WITH- STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE DA WHO WANT TO PURSUE IT. OKAY AND I'M TO THE OPPOSITION- IS IT YOUR VIEW THAT GOING INTO FORCED TREATMENT I KNOW YOU FALL IT WOULD BE VOLUNTARILY MAKING THAT CHOICE BUT IT WOULD BE SORT OF. I GUESS ENTER THE TERMS YOU ALL USE LOCKS TREATMENT. IS THAT WORSE THAN NO TREATMENT AND- AN INSTITUTION. ANYONE OPPOSITION WANNA AND. HAPPY TO- ACTUALLY ARE AT CAN CANCER AT THAT THE QUESTION I WOULD SAY THAT- FORCE TREATMENT MAY HAPPEN THERE HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF THE UNINTENDED- OUTCOME OF THE RAISING THE RISK OF OVERDOSE AND SO I WOULD SAY THAT IN OUR PERSPECTIVE- GOTTEN RID OF FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TO HAVE AN OVERDOSE AND PASSED AWAY FROM AN OVERDOSE IT'S A GREATER. THAN HAVING NO TREATMENT AT ALL IT BY WILL BE EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO ATTEMPT TO ENGAGE IN COMBAT A PERSON AS MANY TIMES AS POSSIBLE TO BRING THEM INTO VOLUNTARY SERVICE THAT IF THEY'RE NOT MOTIVATED TO BE INTO VOLUNTARY SERVICE THAT AND THE TREATMENT IS NOT GOING TO BE AFFECTED BY THE INDIVIDUAL BUT WHEN THEY STILL BE AT RISK COMING OUT OF JAIL OR PRISON. OF THE SAME OVERDOSE RISK. NOW TO THE OPPOSITION I SORRY RESTRUCTURING ANSWERED THEY DID IT THE OPPOSITION DID YOU EITHER ONE OF YOU WANT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. MMHM OKAY- OKAY. AND THEN I. CAN GOT SOME TO ANSWER THE QUESTION THIS IS JOHN RIFLING FROM HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH ON NO I'M NOT A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS BUT I HAVE. OTHER GREAT UNDERSTANDING OF THE- THE SYSTEM IN JAIL SO THAT CERTAINLY PEOPLE. COMING OUT OF ON. YEAH OF. MAYBE AT RISK AND SO WE NEED TO REALLY BOLSTER UP BOTH TREATMENT PROGRAMS WITHIN THE JAILS AND PRISONS BUT ALSO TREATMENT OPTIONS. THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF AND NOT CONNECTED TO THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM- IT FORCING PEOPLE INTO- INTO TREATMENT IS NOT GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE AND IT'S CRIMINALIZING THE TREATMENT SYSTEM. SO I MEAN I AGREE WE NEED TO BOLSTER UP TREATMENT FOR THE FOLKS ARE COMING UP BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS AIMING TO DO AND- IT IS A STRANGE DAY WHEN I'M- VOTING AGAINST THE OPPOSITION ON THIS BILL BUT I DO THINK I'M IN A VOTE FOR THIS BILL AND SEE IT MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE I ALSO. THINK THE STATUS QUO ISN'T WORKING I THINK THE BILL HAS ISSUES I DO SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF OPPOSITION. BUT I ALSO TRUST THAT THIS AUTHOR AND I'VE SEEN HIS WORK OVER THE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE IS GOING AND WITH REALLY GOOD INTENT. AND WE'LL WORK THROUGH SOME OF THOSE ISSUES- AND I DO BELIEVE HIS VALUES ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF. OF THE OPPOSITION TRYING TO HELP AND FIND ALTERNATIVES AND FIGURE OUT OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN- SOLVE SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS SO- MR MCCARTY I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY. I HOPE TO SEE IT GET FIXED THERE ARE SOME THINGS I THINK ARE HAVE ISSUES- BUT I DO THINK WE SHOULD CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION MOVING FORWARD. MISTER CORK CAP. SO WE'VE TALKED A BIT ABOUT THIS. BUT YOU DID NOT MENTION OR PERHAPS I JUST DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING IN YOUR OPENING ABOUT CHANGES THAT YOU WERE WILLING TO MAKE IN THE BILL. AND WHERE YOU WOULD BE GOING WITH THEM DO YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THAT. YEAH AT THAT FIRST OF ALL I REALLY APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION SOMETIMES IT TAKES AN UNCOMFORTABLE SOLUTION TO DEAL WITH THOSE. SERIOUS PROBLEMS WE HAVE AND SO THIS IS ONE WHERE. YOU THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX- I'M VERY MINDFUL ABOUT THE VOLUNTARY VERSUS COERCION. I THINK THIS IS VOLUNTARY SELECT SOMEONE'S CHOOSING TO GO HERE- HANG OUT IN THEIR LIVING ROOM. IF THERE DON'T GO HERE TO THIS TREATMENT FACILITY THEY GO TO JAIL OR PRISON SO IT'S NOT LIKE. THERE'S NO THIRD CHOICE HERE. BUT ONE THING THAT. I WITH MINDFUL OF AFTER TALKING TO YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. IS UPON THE COURT THE JUDGE MAKING THE DECLARATION THAT IT WAS- AT THE DRUG MOTIVATED CRIME AND GIVING THE THAT THE PARTICIPANTS THE OPTION OF INCARCERATION OR TREATMENT. THEY SAY OKAY FINE I'LL DO THIS TREATMENT MAYBE IT WAS A CONTROLLED OR I'M NOT YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY WERE. ENTICED TO DO THIS. THE HIT ROCK BOTTOM WHATEVER HAVE YOU. SO. ONE THING I TALK TO THAT TO OUR LOCAL DA ABOUT TO. IN THE PIE. AS WE WOULD GIVE THE PARTIES. ENOUGH CHANCE AN OPT. IN THE FIRST FEW DAYS OF THEIR TREATMENT. IF THEY SAY YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT TO DO THIS. FIND THE EXIT WE'RE NOT FORCING THEM AGAIN BUT AGAIN THEY'RE NOT GOING HOMES IT'S HANGING OUT. WATCHING THEIR- TV WITH THE ANKLE BRACELET. THEY'RE GOING TO BE INCARCERATED SO LIKE THERE'S A CHOICE TO MAKE BUT WE WILL. GIVE THE PERSON ANOTHER CHOICE THAT I THINK. IS ANOTHER FAIROFFRAMP FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE MAYBE. IN THE HEAT OF THE PASSING OF COURSE IN THE IN THE COURT SYSTEM TO CHOOSE THIS. BILL AB ONE MORE CHOICE TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT YEAH AND THAT DOESN'T I THINK ANSWER THE OBJECTIONS OF THE OPPOSITION. FOR MY OWN- AND- AGAIN IT'S- FIVE I JUST DON'T THINK THIS WILL WORK. AND CLEARLY THE- ISN'T WORKING BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE WAY TO TRY IT SO I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THE BILL UNFORTUNATELY- THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IN HERE ONE IS THAT. YOU CAN'T GET MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT- WILL THE DA BE TRYING TO RAISE THE FUNDS IN OTHER WAYS. THAT IS THERE'S NO FUNDING ATTACHED TO THIS OKAY I GET IT DONE IT IS STATUTORILY AUTHORIZES. THIS JUDICIAL DISCRETION FOR THE YOLO COUNTY COURT SYSTEM TO FOR TO PROVIDE THIS. IT'S UP TO THE YELLOW COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND THEIR- THEIR THEIR THEIR DA TO FIND FUNDING THERE IS A FACILITY ONE THING WE'VE DONE HERE IN CALIFORNIA'S CHANGE OUR JUVENILE COURT SYSTEM OUR JUVENILE HALL. AND THEY HAVE A BRAND NEW JUVENILE ALL OVER THERE THAT'S LESS THAN YOU KNOW TEN FIFTEEN YEARS OLD BUT HAS LIKE THREE KIDS IN THERE. AUTHORIZED FOR HUNDRED FIFTY SO THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A FACILITY WHICH COULD BE EASILY MODIFIED AND TURNED INTO. A RESIDENTIAL DRUG TREATMENT SECURE DRUG TREATMENT FACILITY- JUST THE STAFFING COSTS AND SO THEY'RE PREPARED TO WORK ON THAT ISSUE IF THIS BILL IS AUTHORIZED WHAT ABOUT THE QUESTION OF HAVING SOMEONE WHO'S AN EXPERT IN TREATMENT. INVOLVED IN THIS DECISION. SO THAT- IT'S JUST NOT A JUDGE BUT IT'S THAT AT LEAST YOU'RE GETTING SOME ADVICE FROM SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS THIS. AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY THINK THIS PERSON WOULD BE A- I BELIEVE I WILL TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT I'M ALMOST POSITIVE THAT THAT'S PART OF IT THAT THERE'S- THAT MEDICAL- DECISION THAT'S A RECOMMENDATION TO THE TO THE TO THE- WITH WITH THE COURT AND THE JUDGE. THANK YOU MISTER REISIG ADDRESS THAT ISSUE THIS PROJECT. SURE YEAH THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT THE BILL ENVISIONS TREATMENT PROVIDERS WOULD BE MAKING THE ASSESSMENT AND MAKING THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE COURT. AND THE BILL IS WRITTEN IN SUCH A WAY THAT REALLY EMPOWERS THE TREATMENT PROVIDERS WITH ALMOST YOU KNOW VETO POWER ESSENTIALLY OVER. THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND DECISIONS SO THEY WEREREALLY TRYING TO FOCUS ON THIS BEING TREATMENT ORIENTED AND FOCUSED AND DRIVEN. OKAY AND THEN THE QUESTION OF WHO WOULD STAFF THIS YEAR YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE PROBATION OFFICERS ARE YOU. IT'S UP TO THE COUNTY OF YOLO HI I'M I'D I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT- YOU MISTER RISING DO YOU HAVE AN ANSWER THAT QUESTION. WELL WE HAVEN'T FIGURE THAT PIECE OUT I MEAN THE IDEAS THIS IS A HOSPITAL LIKE SETTING IN MIDDLE BE OBVIOUSLY WHAT THE TREATMENT STAFF THERE- WHAT FORM THE THERE WILL BE SOME. SOMEBODY THERE TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE FOR NOT A VISIONING BARS AND GUNS AND GUARDS. BUT WHETHER IT'S- SOME OTHER STAFF WE JUST DON'T KNOW. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER LEE AND IMAGE TO SEE ARTHUR- I'M JUST GONNA SAY YOU KNOW I DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT WITH THIS CLEARLY AND I AGREED SOME OF. OUR COLLEAGUES HEAR THE STATUS QUO IS NOT WORKING OF COURSE INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT IS THE INVOLUNTARILY GO AND SEE CREATE REAL BILL TO REBUILDING SERVICES FOR THE DRUG ADDICTION. BUT THAT IS IN THE PERFECT CHOICE SETTING IN THIS SETTING THEY WERE CHOOSING ESSENTIALLY BETWEEN GOING TO PRISON OR PERHAPS THIS PROGRAM WHICH OF COURSE ITSELF IN IT IF ITSELF IS NOT A PERFECT CHOICE BUT IT IS A CHOICE IN A WAY. AND I DO BELIEVE- HAVING THAT CHOICE IS IMPORTANT AND SEE HOW IT PLAYS OUT- I ALSO DO LIKE THAT IN THE BILL YOU YOU DO INCLUDE RIGHT NOW HAVING THE- DEALT THE YELLOW COUNTY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY PERFORMING RISK ASSESSMENTS AND WORKING CLASS RELEASE I HOPE THERE WILL BE MORE. EMPHASIS ON THAT AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD OBVIOUS WE DEFINITELY DON'T WANT AS MANY OF OPPOSITION I STRUGGLE THIS IS TO WRITE WE DON'T WANT- WE DON'T WANT TO. TRY TO CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE TO INCARCERATION AND PUTTING IT IN THE SAME SYSTEM JUST. GIVING IT A NEW NAME I THINK THAT'S WHAT SOME CONSTERNATION COMES FROM. AND I UNDERSTAND OBVIOUSLY HAVING THE FACILITY. IS IT CONVENIENT BUT I KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE COULD BE ALARMING TO JUST BE REUSING YOUR FACILITIES. BUT I THINK IN OUR UNCOMFORTABLE PERHAPS CONVERSATION ABOUT REIMAGINING OUR PUBLIC SAFETY INSTITUTIONS. I THINK IT MIGHT BE A PLUS THAT WAS A REPURPOSE THESE BUILDINGS ARE REPURPOSED THINGS. AND I THINK SAID- AS A LEVER CORKS POINT IS TO MAKE SURE THE STAFFING ISN'T WITH. JUST RE PURPOSING- THE SAME OLD SYSTEM OF A PRISON AND JAIL- SO I'LL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY BY DO HO GOING FORWARD IT IS MUCH MUCH MORE- GROUNDED IN EVERY THOUGHT OF SENSE AND SPIRIT OF DIVERSION AND ALSO MORE- FOCUS ON ON THE MEDICAL TREATMENT AS WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER SINISTER. IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS. SOMEBODY WHO COMMITS THEIR PETTY CRIME TO GO TO JAIL- THEY SERVE FOR A- COUPLE WEEKS THEY GET OUT THEY TAKE THEIR DRUGS THEY COMMIT ANOTHER CRIME TO SUPPORT THAT HABITS. AND THEY KEEP DOING THIS UNTIL THEY WIND UP DEAD ON THE GUTTER DEAD IN THE GUTTER. AND THEN EVERYBODY LAMENTS ABOUT OH MY GOD WHY CAN WE DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS. AND IT SEEMS THAT WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT BY ALLOWING. SOMEBODY WHO GETS ARRESTED. AND IS GOING TO BE SERVING TIME. TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE WHILE THEY'RE SERVING TIME. WHICH IN THIS CASE IS TAKING CARE OF THE PROBLEM THE PUT HIM THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND SO THEY CAN EITHER DO NOTHING OR TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM TO PUT IN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND BEING. THAT YOU KNOW. ONCE THEY'RE OUT HOPEFULLY. THERE A COVER. OR THERE ARE WELL ON THEIR WAY TO RECOVERY AND CAN ENTER A SUPPORT. PROGRAM OR WHATEVER IT IS. AT I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT'S ANY. THAN BEING IN PRISON AND GIVING THE CHOICE TO YOU KNOW GET YOUR G. E. D. L. DO SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE. GOING TO PRISON AND SITTING THERE IS NOT PRODUCTIVE IT'S NOT REHABILITATION AND IT DOES THE PERSON ABSOLUTELY NO GOOD FOR THE FUTURE. SO I'M I'M GOING TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL- NUMBER ONE IT'S NOT A STATE WIDE THING- NUMBER TWO IT'S YOU GUYS ARE TAKING THE INITIATIVE TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING AND SEE IF IT WORKS. BECAUSE WAITING UNTIL SOMEBODY'S DEAD IN A GUTTERIS NOT WORKING VERY WELL. AND WE'RE DOING THAT A LOT AND WE SEE THAT ARE HOMELESS POPULATION AND- AND WE SEE THAT WITH A LOT OF OUR ARE ADDICTED PEOPLE THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY HOMELESS. BUT APPEARED TO BE HALF THE TIME BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE NO OTHER WAY. SO SO I I'M I'M GOING TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL AND- I THINK THERE'S ALREADY IT AND MOVED ON YES. IT IS OUR MOTION. YOU WANT TO DID HAVE A COMMENT. OKAY WELL SHALL. I'M MISS MCCARTY WHEN I THINK YOU FOR THIS THESE ARE. HE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING MR LACKEY POINTED OUT WITH- YOU KNOW I'VE TRIED DISEASE AN ADDICTION THAT WE IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US TO. DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO AND I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE YOU'RE SAYING. SENDING PEOPLE TO- CARCERAL SITUATION ISN'T HELPING THEM AND SO WE'RE GONNA PROVIDED OPTION WHERE THEY CAN GET THE TREATMENT THAT WILL HOPEFULLY TURN THEIR LIVES AROUND AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD NEVER FORGET THE PEOPLE. WHO ARE IMPACTED BY THESE BILLS AND WHETHER THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO STRUGGLE WITH DRUG ADDICTION OR VICTIMS OR PEOPLE WHO STRUCK SUFFERED THE INJUSTICES OF OUR SYSTEM THESE ARE PEOPLE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE WORK YOU'RE DOING FOR THEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU NO IN THE COMMENTS. YOU MAY CLOSE MISS MCCARTY YEAH THE THESE ARE PEOPLE THERE'S A YOUNG MAN NAMED MR REISIG NOT R. DA. FOR THE NEPHEW OF RDA. HEROIN DRUG ADDICT HUNDRED BOULEVARD I FIVE. KEEPING THEIR COMMITTING CRIMES TO FEED HIS ADDICTION AND HE'S BEEN ARRESTED INTO THE SYSTEM OVER AND OVER SO THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE KNOW I KNOW PEOPLE IN MY OWN. CIRCLE AS WELL WE ALL DO THESE ARE ALL INDIVIDUALS AND THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS IT UTTER FAILURE AND I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE OPPOSITION PEOPLE WHO ARE COMMITTED TO ADDICTION MEDICINE AND TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK THE RIGHT WAY BUT THERE IS NO RIGHT WAY FOR MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF GOING TO JAIL OR- THE COUNTY JAIL OR STATE PRISON AND HAVING A GREAT. DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAM THERE IS NOT OF VIOLENCE NOT WORKING SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- I RESPECTFULLY JUST DISAGREE MISTER GREG I DON'T SEE ANY HARM HERE BECAUSE- WORST CASE SCENARIO. WE FIND OUT WHAT WORKS AND DOESN'T WORK AND COME BACK AND DO IT A DIFFERENT COUNTY RIVERSIDE OR SOMEWHERE ELSE. BEST CASE WE SAVE SOME LIVES BEST BEST CASE WE FIND A WAY TO MAKE THIS WORK. ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA SO- THE STATUS QUO AGAIN LIKE YOU SAID MR LEE IS UNACCEPTABLE. I THINK THIS IS A FAIR- SOLUTION WHEN WE CAME OUT WITH THIS IDEA SIX MONTHS AGO IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT WE LISTEN TO THE OPPOSITION. MADE IT NOT JUST MISDEMEANORS AND FELONIES JUST FELONIES MADE IT SO IT'S ABSOLUTELY VOLUNTARY NOT DOES NOT WITHOUT A CHOICE. BUT A JUDGE TO DO THIS AND WE CAME UP WITH ANOTHER SOLUTION TODAY WHICH I THINK IS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ALL. YOU DID CAN YOU TO CONTINUE TO WORK- WITH THE OPPOSITION TO- TO WORK ON THE CRAFTING OF THIS WITHOUT ASKING RIGHT THANK YU. THIS THIS MUST BE A SPECIAL DAY FOR THIS COMMITTEE- BASALMOST LIKE PILOT PROJECT DATE IF YOU HAD ONE TODAY WAS THE DAY TO DO IT- NOT ONLY DID THIS COMMITTEE IN A PREVIOUS BILL- BASICALLY DID FOR WOBBLER FELONIES WHICH- I THINK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE I WOULD SAY IS THIS PROBABLY CONSIDER HISTORIC L. A. N. UP IN A LOT OF WAYS- BUT IT BUT IT BUT IT WE'RE DOING IT AS A PILOT PROJECT SO WE COULD SEE WHETHER OR NOT. AS MANY HAVE PRESCRIBED AT THAT ADDING PENALTIES ARE FELONIES- WORK AND WE GET WE GET OPPORTUNITY IN A IN A LIMITED SCOPE TO SEE THAT YOUR BILL NOW ACTUALLY IT TAX DRUG ABUSE AND COMING UP WITH A DIFFERENT WAY TO ACHIEVE WHAT WE ALL WANT IS TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREET CAN OFFER DRUGS- AS I REMEMBER CA. UP IN IN HIGH SCHOOL IF YOU YOU HAD THE BAD KIDS WOULD GO BEFORE A JUDGE AND THEY WOULD HAVE A- CHOICE BETWEEN THE- THE MILITARY ARE GOING TO JAIL. AND IF YOU WERE REALLY BAD LIKE SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES YOU YOU END UP IN THE MARINES BUT- YOU YOU DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU WORK. THEY WOULD THEN SHOP FOR YOU TO THAT. AND SO- BUT THAT PROGRAM IS NO LONGER DOES NOT DONE. ANYMORE AND- I KNOW SOME PEOPLE THAT CHOSE THE AIRFORCE OR WHATEVER AND THEY CAME OUT. BECAUSE THEY HAD A STRUCTURED LIFE AND IT CAME OUT PRETTY GOOD- I THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO STRIVE. TO DO KIND OF THE SAME THING BUT HOPEFULLY AND I THINK YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK USING MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. AND HAVING THIS MORE OF A TREATMENT CENTER. IN A FACILITY THAT- THAT'S IT'S ABOUT KEEPING PEOPLE THERE AND YOU'RE GIVING THEM A CHOICE IT DAVE. IF THEY DON'T WANT TO BE TREATED THEY CAN THEY CAN TAKE THE ALTERNATIVE WHICH WE WOULD THANK IS NOT IN THE BEST INTERESTS. BUT THEY HAVE ANOTHER OPTION AND MORE OPTIONS YOU GIVE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON DRUGS. I THINK THE MORE THAT THEIR SUCCESS RATE MAY GET BETTER AND BETTER AND THIS MAY JUST BE THE START OF ONE WAY TO DO IT. TO HOPEFULLY COME UP WITH ANOTHER WAY IN ANOTHER WAY AND WE GIVEN UP DOORS. THAT WE GET MORE MORE PEOPLE- ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY SHOULD. SHE I AM NOT. IT THE CALL THE ROLL.
