MODELED AFTER A BILL THAT I DID

00:08:39.986 --> 00:08:40.853
LAST YEAR WHEN HE CAME TO

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.054

ARTIFICIAL.

00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:45.057
INTELLIGENCE BASICALLY WHAT

00:08:45.124 --> 00:08:46.225
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS CREATE A

00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:47.827

00:13:16.795 --> 00:13:18.364
IMPORTANT AND VITAL TO OUR

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.533

00:16:57.282 --> 00:16:58.050
SO ARE WE GONNA HAVE PEOPLE

00:16:58.117 --> 00:17:00.619
CALLING NINE ONE ONE TO SAY BY

00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:02.121
THE WAY I HAVE A CHILD EACH HAS

00:17:02.187 --> 00:17:03.889
A PROBLEM RIGHT BUT AN ADULT TO

00:17:03.956 --> 00:17:06.759
THIS OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE A

00:17:06.825 --> 00:17:08.660

DISPATCHERS SCREEN.

00:17:32.985 --> 00:17:33.552
WHICH THEN THE DISPATCHERS ABLE

00:17:33.619 --> 00:17:35.053

THERE'S A REQUEST TO KEEP IT

00:17:45.931 --> 00:17:47.466
OPEN LONGER AND THEN THAT SCREEN

00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:48.267
DISAPPEARS.

00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:49.902
BUT THAT THAT'S KIND OF HOW IT

00:17:49.968 --> 00:17:50.536

THEN THEY'RE ABLE TO COMBAT OUT

00:17:56.842 --> 00:17:58.811
IN IN THAT KIND OF SYSTEM IF THE

00:17:58.877 --> 00:18:00.546
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS TO GO

00:18:00.612 --> 00:18:01.180
WITH THAT KIND OF SYSTEM.

00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:02.481
