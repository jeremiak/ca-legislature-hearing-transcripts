PEOPLE FROM NEARBY TOWNS ARE NOW

01:00:27.357 --> 01:00:29.859

ARRIVE.

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:35.932
IN ADDITION LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE

01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:38.368
ESTIMATING THAT A MINIMUM OF TWO

01:00:38.434 --> 01:00:39.602
THOUSAND UTILITY AND

01:00:39.669 --> 01:00:41.170

01:00:45.041 --> 01:00:46.609
HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS.

01:00:46.676 --> 01:00:47.844
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THEIR

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:49.612
WORK THESE WORKERS ARE MORE AT

01:00:49.679 --> 01:00:51.381
RISK FOR INJURY REQUIRING

01:00:51.447 --> 01:00:53.082
EMERGENCY CARE.

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:54.684

01:01:06.462 --> 01:01:08.264
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE IN OUR

01:01:09.999 --> 01:01:11.601
UNIQUE SITUATION.

01:01:11.667 --> 01:01:13.770
WE DO NOT YET KNOW WHICH OF OUR

01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:15.304
NEIGHBORS WILL BE COMING BACK.

01:01:15.371 --> 01:01:16.806
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN AND WHERE

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:18.274
BUILDING OR REBUILDING WILL

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:19.942

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:51.760
COUNTY IS TO LOOK AT THE

01:08:51.827 --> 01:08:53.195
EXISTING PROGRAM.

01:08:53.262 --> 01:08:55.064
THIS IS SIMPLY ADDING ANOTHER

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:57.032
PARAMETER AS WE KNOW ALL CALLS

01:08:57.099 --> 01:08:58.134
NOT A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE SO IT

01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.268
DOESN'T FALL WITHIN THE LAND

01:08:59.335 --> 01:09:01.370
COMPETITORS ACT.

01:09:01.437 --> 01:09:01.904
THIS IS JUST GOING TO ADD

01:09:01.971 --> 01:09:03.739
ALCOHOL.

01:09:03.806 --> 01:09:04.573
AND THEN CERTAINLY IF THERE WAS

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.474
NOT IT LATER AFTER OUR CALL WAS

01:09:05.541 --> 01:09:06.976
INCLUDED BECAUSE HE THE EFFICACY

01:09:07.042 --> 01:09:07.977
OF ADDING IT AND WHETHER OR NOT

HELPING PEOPLE WITH THEIR LIVES

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:11.447
SO THIS WAS A A NARAL ON IT TO

01:09:11.514 --> 01:09:15.684
THREE COUNTIES WE'RE TALKING

01:09:15.751 --> 01:09:17.820

FIFTY EIGHT BEING ONE THAT CAME

01:09:19.054 --> 01:09:19.421

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:20.256
I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:21.390

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:22.625
THEY'RE RUNNING THOSE PROGRAMS

01:09:22.691 --> 01:09:24.159
THE LIMITED DOLLARS IT MAKES.

01:09:24.226 --> 01:09:25.694
IT MAKES IT HARD FOR ME TO DATE

01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:26.562
IT REALLY.

01:09:26.629 --> 01:09:29.598
I WOULD LOVE TO SUPPORT YOU BUT

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:30.566

ARE AND THIS IS GOING TO BE AN

01:09:31.634 --> 01:09:32.735
ENCROACHMENT ON THAT.

01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:35.037
WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:36.272
IT ISN'T THAT THE FOR THOSE

01:09:36.338 --> 01:09:38.107
FOLKS THAT ARE DRINKING DON'T

01:09:38.173 --> 01:09:39.074
NEED HELP.

01:09:39.141 --> 01:09:40.709
I JUST THINK THAT WE NEED TO

01:09:40.776 --> 01:09:42.444
LOOK AT HOW WE CAN BETTER PLAY

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:44.313

FOR THE ENTIRE PRESENTATION BUT

01:10:13.075 --> 01:10:14.243
I LOOK I I THINK IT'S I THINK

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:14.877
SUPPORT YOU TAKE UP THE ISSUE I

01:10:14.944 --> 01:10:15.778
CARRIED SOMETHING SIMILAR US

01:10:15.844 --> 01:10:16.579
SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

01:10:16.645 --> 01:10:18.047

01:10:18.113 --> 01:10:19.548
HIGH -- AND I KNOW THAT THEY'LL

01:10:19.615 --> 01:10:20.282

01:10:20.349 --> 01:10:21.884
COMMENTS AND I'M NOT TABLE THAT

01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:23.385
CONVERSATION BUT IT'S ABSOLUTELY

01:10:23.452 --> 01:10:24.820
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE THE WHAT

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:26.255
YOU NEED TO ASK YOURSELF NOT YOU

01:10:26.322 --> 01:10:27.790
BUT GENERAL YOU.

01:10:27.856 --> 01:10:29.325
IS WHAT'S THE WORST OF TWO EVILS

01:10:29.391 --> 01:10:30.826
AND IN MY CASE WE WERE PURSUING

01:10:30.893 --> 01:10:32.194

01:10:32.261 --> 01:10:34.330
NECESSITY -- ADMINISTER AMOUNT

01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:35.731

THAT -- IS THAT ALL THE

01:10:37.733 --> 01:10:38.667

01:10:43.005 --> 01:10:46.208
FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL -- AND AND ON

01:10:46.275 --> 01:10:46.842
TOP OF THAT THAT AT THE END OF

01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:48.644
THE WE'VE GOT TO FIND SOME SORT

01:10:48.711 --> 01:10:51.313

01:10:53.282 --> 01:10:54.883
TREATMENT THEY NEED EVEN IF THEY

01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:57.019
DON'T WANT TO THEMSELVES OR

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:58.687
UNWILLING TO DO IT ON THEIR OWN --

01:10:58.754 --> 01:10:59.989
IT'S A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION

01:11:00.055 --> 01:11:02.424

INSPIRED THIS BILL IS SAID I HAD

A WONDERFUL AND HER NAME WAS

01:11:37.593 --> 01:11:39.061
REVEILLE.

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:42.031
AND I CAME FROM A VERY MODEST

01:11:42.097 --> 01:11:43.399
INCOME FAMILY AND HAD.

01:11:43.465 --> 01:11:45.768
THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE WITH HER

01:11:45.834 --> 01:11:46.335
WELL I WAS GOING TO PHARMACY

01:11:46.402 --> 01:11:47.236
SCHOOL.

01:11:47.302 --> 01:11:47.903
AND ONE THING THAT JUST WASN'T

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:49.638
TALK ABOUT IN THE FAMILY WAS THE

01:11:49.705 --> 01:11:50.906
FACT THAT SHE HAD A ALCOHOL

01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:52.875
PROBLEM.

01:11:52.941 --> 01:11:54.143
AND I LEARNED IT WHEN I GOT UP

01:11:54.209 --> 01:11:55.110
ONE MORNING AND WENT TO

01:11:55.177 --> 01:11:57.112

01:12:01.383 --> 01:12:02.751
IT WAS JUST PURE VODKA AND SHE

01:12:02.818 --> 01:12:04.053
WAS A FUNCTIONING ALCOHOLIC IN A

01:12:04.119 --> 01:12:05.754

01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:15.531
OLD.

01:12:15.597 --> 01:12:17.099

01:12:19.301 --> 01:12:20.836

01:28:25.166 --> 01:28:26.668
THE POINT BEING CONSUMERS KNOW

01:28:26.734 --> 01:28:28.002
WHAT THEY'RE DRINKING.

01:28:28.069 --> 01:28:29.037
THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL

01:28:29.103 --> 01:28:30.571
ARGUE THAT CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR

01:28:30.638 --> 01:28:31.939
SWEETENED BEVERAGES PRESENTS A

01:28:32.006 --> 01:28:33.941
UNIQUE DRIVER TO THE OBESITY AND

01:28:34.008 --> 01:28:35.543
DIABETES CRISIS.

01:28:35.610 --> 01:28:37.412
SO MUCH SO THAT ONLY THESE SUGAR

01:28:37.478 --> 01:28:39.380
SWEETENED PRODUCTS IN THE STATE

01:28:39.447 --> 01:28:40.581
OF CALIFORNIA WARNING LABEL.

01:28:40.648 --> 01:28:41.949
UNFORTUNATELY THAT POSITION DOES

01:28:42.016 --> 01:28:43.117
NOT ALIGNED WITH WHAT WE KNOW

01:28:43.184 --> 01:28:44.218
ABOUT THE CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR

01:28:44.285 --> 01:28:46.054
SWEETENED BEVERAGES.

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:47.889
RESEARCH BY THE CDC SHOWS THAT

01:28:47.955 --> 01:28:48.823
OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS

01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:50.291
CONSUMPTION FROM SUGAR SWEETENED

01:28:50.358 --> 01:28:51.292
BEVERAGES HAS DECLINED

01:28:51.359 --> 01:28:54.996
SIGNIFICANTLY. 26% FOR ADULTS

01:28:55.063 --> 01:28:57.432
AND 36% FOR YOUTH.

01:28:57.498 --> 01:28:59.567
YEAH ADDITIONAL RESEARCH BY CDC

01:28:59.634 --> 01:29:01.102
SENT NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:02.437
STATISTICS REPORTS THAT OBESITY

01:29:02.503 --> 01:29:05.339
RATES DURING THAT SAME PERIOD OF

01:29:05.406 --> 01:29:11.479
TIME REXI RISING.

01:29:11.546 --> 01:29:12.914
CLEARLY SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGE

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:14.682
CONSUMPTION CAN'T BE BOTH

01:29:14.749 --> 01:29:16.317
FALLING AND AT THE SAME TIME BE

01:29:16.384 --> 01:29:18.152
THE LEADING DRIVER OF THE

01:29:18.219 --> 01:29:19.187
INCREASE IN OBESITY THAT JUST

01:29:19.253 --> 01:29:21.422
DOESN'T ADD UP.

01:29:21.489 --> 01:29:22.690
SO WHAT ARE CONSUMERS DRINKING

01:29:22.757 --> 01:29:24.459
ACTUALLY TODAY TODAY OF ALL

01:29:24.525 --> 01:29:27.128
BEVERAGES PURCHASED 50% OF THEM

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:28.763
ARE ACTUALLY CONTAIN ZERO SUGAR

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:30.431
AND THAT NUMBER IS ON THE RISE.

01:29:30.498 --> 01:29:31.699
CONSUMERS ARE MAKING THIS CHOICE

01:29:31.766 --> 01:29:34.168
FOR THEMSELVES.

01:29:34.235 --> 01:29:35.236
THE PROPONENTS ALSO RAISE THIS

01:29:35.303 --> 01:29:36.971
IS THE SPECTER OF SUGAR

01:29:37.038 --> 01:29:38.306
SWEETENED BEVERAGES BEING THE

01:29:38.372 --> 01:29:40.875
LARGEST SOURCE OF QUOTE ADDED

01:29:40.942 --> 01:29:42.543
SUGARS IN THE AMERICAN DIET.

01:29:42.610 --> 01:29:44.245
THE CHALLENGE OF THE DATA POINT

01:29:44.312 --> 01:29:46.080
IS IT CAN SOUND MISLEADING.

01:29:46.147 --> 01:29:47.548
THE US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE

01:29:47.615 --> 01:29:49.383
TRACKS CONSUMPTION OF CALORIES

01:29:49.450 --> 01:29:50.952
FROM FOOD PRODUCTS IN THE US

01:29:51.018 --> 01:29:52.920
DIET AND BREAKS IT DOWN INTO

01:29:52.987 --> 01:29:54.756
SEVEN DISTINCT CATEGORIES.

01:29:54.822 --> 01:29:56.124
FOODS AND BEVERAGES CONTAINING

01:29:56.190 --> 01:29:57.925
ADDED SUGARS IS ONE OF THOSE

01:29:57.992 --> 01:29:59.894
DISTINCT CATEGORIES.

01:29:59.961 --> 01:30:00.828
AND IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THE

01:30:00.895 --> 01:30:02.497
LARGEST SOURCE OF CALORIES IN

01:30:02.563 --> 01:30:04.632
OUR DIET IT'S NOT THE LARGEST OF

01:30:04.699 --> 01:30:05.600
THOSE CATEGORIES.

01:30:05.666 --> 01:30:06.934
IN FACT THESE FOODS AND

01:30:07.001 --> 01:30:08.669
BEVERAGES ARE THE FOURTH LARGEST

01:30:08.736 --> 01:30:09.971
CATEGORY REPRESENTING

01:30:10.037 --> 01:30:11.839
APPROXIMATELY 15% OF THE

01:30:11.906 --> 01:30:14.175
CALORIES IN THE AMERICAN DIET.

01:30:14.242 --> 01:30:15.443
SO WHILE WE MAY DISAGREE WITH

01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:16.811
THE CHARACTERIZATIONS SUGAR

01:30:16.878 --> 01:30:18.212
SWEETENED BEVERAGES ARE THE

01:30:18.279 --> 01:30:20.314
LARGEST SOURCE OF ADDED SUGARS

01:30:20.381 --> 01:30:21.482
IN THE AMERICAN DIET.

01:30:21.549 --> 01:30:23.484
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THAT

01:30:23.551 --> 01:30:25.586
NUMBER IF IT'S A CORRECT NUMBER

01:30:25.653 --> 01:30:28.122
WHICH WE DISPUTE IS STILL 8% OF

01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:29.624
THE TOTAL CALORIES.

01:30:29.690 --> 01:30:31.826
IN THE DIET CONSUMED AND THAT

01:30:31.893 --> 01:30:33.594
NUMBER AGAIN IS DROPPING.

01:30:33.661 --> 01:30:35.062
SO WILL NOT ALL INSIGNIFICANT

01:30:35.129 --> 01:30:36.464
THE SOURCE OF ADDED SUGAR AND

01:30:36.531 --> 01:30:39.100
CALORIES CANNOT BE THE DRIVER OF

01:30:39.167 --> 01:30:40.401
THE MUCH LARGER PROBLEM.

01:30:40.468 --> 01:30:41.903
THAT IS OUR FRUSTRATION THIS

01:30:41.969 --> 01:30:43.404
MUCH LARGER PROBLEM OF OBESITY

01:30:43.471 --> 01:30:44.939
AND DIABETES AND THEREFORE DOES

01:30:45.006 --> 01:30:47.041
NOT WARRANT THE ONLY STATE

01:30:47.108 --> 01:30:49.477
SANCTIONED WARNING LABEL WITH

01:30:49.544 --> 01:30:57.318

NOT SEE JOB LOSS IN A SINGLE

DRINK WITH LESS SUGAR.

01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:26.901
IS MORE HARMFUL THAN A DRINK

FOOD OR CANDY WITH TWO OR THREE

01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:30.004

THINK YOU'RE TAKING IT TO THE

01:35:46.774 --> 01:35:48.976
NEXT LEVEL BUT BUT IN ALL

01:35:49.043 --> 01:35:50.277
SERIOUSLY WHY WE'RE HERE IS

01:35:50.344 --> 01:35:54.849
BECAUSE THE CONSUMER HAS NO IDEA.

01:35:54.915 --> 01:35:55.483
AND SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY IT'S

01:35:55.549 --> 01:35:56.383
IT WILL BE A WORTHLESS MORNING

01:35:56.450 --> 01:35:57.551
IN THE CALORIES ARE ON FRONT I

01:35:57.618 --> 01:35:58.953
CONCUR THAT THERE'S MORE

01:35:59.019 --> 01:35:59.820
INFORMATION.

01:35:59.887 --> 01:36:02.656
ON THE FRONT OF THE PACKAGE.

01:36:02.723 --> 01:36:04.258
AS OPPOSED THE BACKED IN YEARS

01:36:04.325 --> 01:36:06.460
PAST BUT I DON'T THINK THE

01:36:06.527 --> 01:36:09.763
AVERAGE CONSUMER MOM K&lt;c.cyan&gt; DAD&lt;/c&gt;

01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:10.598
FAMILY MEMBER.

01:36:10.664 --> 01:36:12.066
KNOWS WHEN THEY BUY A TWENTY

01:36:12.133 --> 01:36:12.800
OUNCE.

01:36:12.867 --> 01:36:15.302
BOTTLE OF COCA COLA THAT YOU

01:36:15.369 --> 01:36:16.537
LOOK AT THAT.

01:36:16.604 --> 01:36:19.440
SUGAR AND DIVIDE BY I THINK IT'S

01:36:19.507 --> 01:36:20.708
THREE POINT NINE AND REALIZE

01:36:20.774 --> 01:36:22.076
THAT THAT.

01:36:22.143 --> 01:36:26.046
HAS SIXTEEN TEASPOONS OF SUGAR.

01:36:26.113 --> 01:36:27.214
AND IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHEN

01:36:27.281 --> 01:36:28.282
THEY'RE MAKING THEIR ICE TEA IF

01:36:28.349 --> 01:36:33.921
THEY PUT. ONE TEASPOON IN.

01:36:33.988 --> 01:36:36.590
THIRTY TWO THREE AFTER SIX SEVEN

01:36:36.657 --> 01:36:37.258
EIGHT NINE TEN DO THINK YOU KNOW

01:36:37.324 --> 01:36:37.458
WHAT.

01:36:37.525 --> 01:36:41.428
LITTLE TOO MUCH. SIXTEEN

01:36:41.495 --> 01:36:42.563
SEVENTEEN PROBABLY TOO MUCH.

01:36:42.630 --> 01:36:44.031
AND I THINK THAT THE CONSUMER

01:36:44.098 --> 01:36:46.867
DOESN'T NOW AND AND I WOULD I

01:36:46.934 --> 01:36:48.502
WOULD PREFER NOT JUST.

01:36:48.569 --> 01:36:51.238
A WARNING AS FAR AS THE GENERIC

01:36:51.305 --> 01:36:53.240
WARNING BUT HAVE ACTUAL

01:36:53.307 --> 01:36:55.676
TEASPOONS OF SUGAR BECAUSE THE

01:36:55.743 --> 01:36:57.711
GRAMS OF SUGAR.

01:36:57.778 --> 01:36:58.345
YOU KNOW MOST PEOPLE DON'T GET

01:36:58.412 --> 01:37:01.482
THE LONG DIVISION MATH AND

01:37:01.549 --> 01:37:02.883
FIGURING OUT ON THE FLY.

01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:05.152
SO -- YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY WE'RE

01:37:05.219 --> 01:37:07.955
HERE AND LOOK THERE'S NO PERFECT

01:37:08.022 --> 01:37:09.657
SCIENCE IT SHOWS THAT THIS IS

01:37:09.723 --> 01:37:11.025
THE REASON FOR THE OBESITY

01:37:11.091 --> 01:37:13.260
EPIDEMIC BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE

01:37:13.327 --> 01:37:14.828
EMPTY CALORIES THAT PEOPLE ARE

01:37:14.895 --> 01:37:16.330
UTILIZING THESE DAYS I MEAN

01:37:16.397 --> 01:37:17.698
CHOCOLATE CAKE IS ONE THING

01:37:17.765 --> 01:37:18.999
HAMBURGERS.

01:37:19.066 --> 01:37:21.368
BUT THOSE AT LEAST HAVE SOME

01:37:21.435 --> 01:37:22.403
NUTRITIONAL VALUE.

01:37:22.469 --> 01:37:24.071
THESE DRINKS ESPECIALLY THAT

01:37:24.138 --> 01:37:26.774
SUGAR SWEET ONES -- HAVE HAVE

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:28.676
ZERO NUTRITIONAL VALUE.

01:37:28.742 --> 01:37:30.077
IN THE INDUSTRY THAT THEY ARE

01:37:30.144 --> 01:37:31.712
JUST TAKING THE RIGHT STEP

01:37:31.779 --> 01:37:33.547
CONSUMERS ARE VOTING WITH THEIR

01:37:33.614 --> 01:37:34.748
FEET IN THEIR POCKET BOOK IN.

01:37:34.815 --> 01:37:36.116
THE INDUSTRY IS PROBABLY MAKING

01:37:36.183 --> 01:37:37.851
JUST AS MUCH OR MORE MONEY OFF

01:37:37.918 --> 01:37:39.320
THE OTHER DRINKS THE KNEES AND

01:37:39.386 --> 01:37:39.887
SO.

01:37:39.954 --> 01:37:40.821
I DON'T THINK THAT THE ANSWER IS

01:37:40.888 --> 01:37:42.122
GOING TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS BY

01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:44.391
NOT SELLING AS MANY OF OF THIS

01:37:44.458 --> 01:37:45.793
DRINK WE HAVE BEFORE US.

01:37:45.859 --> 01:37:49.096
AND YOU KNOW I I I I DON'T

01:37:49.163 --> 01:37:50.030
UNDERSTAND.

01:37:50.097 --> 01:37:53.200
WHAT THE BIG HARM AS OF THIS AND

01:37:53.267 --> 01:37:54.802
I I I DON'T QUITE GET HOW?

01:37:54.868 --> 01:37:56.837
IT'S A JOB KILLER IT'S

01:37:56.904 --> 01:37:59.006
INFORMATION PEOPLE ARE STILL

01:37:59.073 --> 01:38:01.375
MANUFACTURE PRODUCE THIS IN

01:38:01.442 --> 01:38:03.010
CALIFORNIA.

01:38:03.077 --> 01:38:03.944
THEY SELL IT.

01:38:04.011 --> 01:38:04.712
WHERE THE FOURTH THE FIFTH

01:38:04.778 --> 01:38:06.513
LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND

01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:07.514
I'M GONNA GO AWAY THE SOUL TO

01:38:07.581 --> 01:38:08.249
SELL THEIR PRODUCT WITH THIS

01:38:08.315 --> 01:38:11.151
LABEL?

01:38:11.218 --> 01:38:14.722
OR Nó LABEL -- AND I I JUST --

01:38:14.788 --> 01:38:16.790
I KNOW THAT THIS IS A TOUGH

01:38:16.857 --> 01:38:17.024
FIGHT.

01:38:17.091 --> 01:38:20.094
IS BIG BUSINESS AND BIG INDUSTRY --

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:22.563
BEHIND THIS -- JUST LIKE WE FACE

01:38:22.630 --> 01:38:23.197
IN THE TOBACCO FIGHTS IS IS A

01:38:23.264 --> 01:38:26.200
BIG BIG DEAL IN OUR SOCIETY SO I

01:38:26.267 --> 01:38:27.935
APPLAUD YOU FOR STICKING OUT IT --

01:38:28.002 --> 01:38:30.037
I DO HAVE JUST TWO QUESTIONS FOR

01:38:30.104 --> 01:38:32.039
THE OPPOSITION AND I'M KIND OF

01:38:32.106 --> 01:38:35.042
CONFUSED SO I UNDERSTAND I KNOW

01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:35.976
MR A LOT OF YOUR YOU SAID

01:38:36.043 --> 01:38:38.112
REPRESENT BOTH THE RETAILERS AND

01:38:38.178 --> 01:38:40.614
PEPSICO SO I UNDERSTAND THE

01:38:40.681 --> 01:38:42.650
PEPSICO ARGUMENT THAT THE NOT.

01:38:42.716 --> 01:38:43.951
NOT LIKE IN THIS BUT FROM THE

01:38:44.018 --> 01:38:46.020
RETAILERS AND THE CONVENIENCE

01:38:46.086 --> 01:38:49.857
STORES WHAT'S THE THAT THE

01:38:49.923 --> 01:38:51.425
STRONG AND VERSION FROM THERE

01:38:51.492 --> 01:38:53.227
IT'S A BABY SELLING THE PRODUCT

01:38:53.294 --> 01:38:54.762
WITH A LABEL WITHOUT THE LABEL.

01:38:54.828 --> 01:38:56.397
I KNOW THERE'S SOME SOME FINDS

01:38:56.463 --> 01:38:58.499
IN THERE AS FAR AS AT AND

01:38:58.565 --> 01:39:00.000
HARASSED BUT BUT I'M TRYING.

01:39:00.067 --> 01:39:06.073
TO FOCUS ON THE NEXUS FOR THEIR

01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:08.175
STRONG OPPOSITION SURE.

01:39:08.242 --> 01:39:08.809
AND IT'S SO SIGNIFICANT SO MY

01:39:08.876 --> 01:39:09.576
RETAIL MEMBERS NEARLY EVERY

01:39:09.643 --> 01:39:11.111
SINGLE ONE OF THEM ALSO HAS

01:39:11.178 --> 01:39:11.712
THEIR OWN PRIVATE LABELS THEY

01:39:11.779 --> 01:39:12.880
ALSO STOCK ACTORS MANUFACTURERS

01:39:12.946 --> 01:39:13.514
THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM.

01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:14.415
NOT NOT ONLY IN THE AREA OF

01:39:14.481 --> 01:39:15.582
SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES BUT

01:39:15.649 --> 01:39:17.318
ALMOST ANYTHING THAT WE OFFER.

01:39:17.384 --> 01:39:18.652
YOUR LOCAL GUY AND YOU GO TO

01:39:18.719 --> 01:39:19.653
BAILEY'S IN BELLAIRE YOU KNOW

THEY HAVE THEIR OWN BRANDS THAT

01:39:20.721 --> 01:39:22.323
WE'RE THE MANUFACTURER IN THOSE

01:39:22.389 --> 01:39:24.258
INSTANCES -- SAME IS TRUE FOR

01:39:24.325 --> 01:39:26.260
SAFE WAY SAME IS TRUE FOR VON SO

01:39:26.327 --> 01:39:29.163
WHERE MANUFACTURERS AS WELL AS

01:39:29.229 --> 01:39:29.663
OUR READ THAT AS WE ARE

01:39:29.730 --> 01:39:30.564
RETAILERS.

01:39:30.631 --> 01:39:31.231
THE THING IS WE SELL AGAIN A LOT

01:39:31.298 --> 01:39:31.865
OF DIFFERENT FOOD AND BEVERAGE

01:39:31.932 --> 01:39:33.634
PRODUCTS WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY

01:39:33.701 --> 01:39:34.868
ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT

01:39:34.935 --> 01:39:36.070
INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THE

01:39:36.136 --> 01:39:36.537
CONSUMERS.

01:39:36.603 --> 01:39:38.472
IS ACCURATE -- WE DON'T DISPUTE

01:39:38.539 --> 01:39:39.573
THE FACT THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NOT

01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:41.008
CONSUME TOO MUCH SUGAR WHAT WE

01:39:41.075 --> 01:39:42.476
DISPUTE THE FACT IS THAT THIS

01:39:42.543 --> 01:39:44.445
PRODUCT SINGLE THE CONSUMPTION

01:39:44.511 --> 01:39:45.512
RATE WHICH IS DROPPING IS THE

01:39:45.579 --> 01:39:46.814
ONLY PRODUCT THE NEEDS TO HAVE A

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:48.048
WARNING LABEL.

01:39:48.115 --> 01:39:49.183
IT DOES CONVEY FROM THE STATE OF

01:39:49.249 --> 01:39:50.851
CALIFORNIA THAT THIS IS THE COST

01:39:50.918 --> 01:39:52.653
PRODUCT AND SO WE DISAGREE

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:54.254
FUNDAMENTALLY WITH THAT BOTH AS

01:39:54.321 --> 01:39:58.258
A MANUFACTURER AND AS A RETAILER.

01:39:58.325 --> 01:40:00.461
SURE I CAN AND THEN THAT'LL I AM

01:40:00.527 --> 01:40:01.061
REALLY HAS TO THINK THE LAST

01:40:01.128 --> 01:40:02.830
INTO THIS IS THE ONLY PRODUCT

01:40:02.896 --> 01:40:05.299
WHICH HAS. ZERO NUTRITIONAL

01:40:05.366 --> 01:40:07.901
VALUE AND AND AND THE OTHERS

01:40:07.968 --> 01:40:10.371
KATIE CHEESE BURGER AND SO FORTH

01:40:10.437 --> 01:40:11.505
IT DOES HAVE SOME.

01:40:11.572 --> 01:40:13.340
NUTRITIONAL VALUE THESE THESE

01:40:13.407 --> 01:40:14.375
THAT THESE ARE EMPTY CALORIES.

01:40:14.441 --> 01:40:15.876
SURE AGAIN YOU CAN GET IN A

01:40:15.943 --> 01:40:17.644
GREAT DEBATE ABOUT THE CALORIC

01:40:17.711 --> 01:40:19.913
VALUE OR THE NUTRITIONAL VALUE

01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:20.547
WE DON'T.

01:40:20.614 --> 01:40:21.582
I DON'T THINK ANY OF THE

01:40:21.648 --> 01:40:24.118
MANUFACTURERS OF THE SOFT DRINKS

01:40:24.184 --> 01:40:25.886
THOSE BEING SUGAR SWEETENED

01:40:25.953 --> 01:40:27.688
BEVERAGES THAT ARE -- CARBONATES

01:40:27.755 --> 01:40:28.555
OFFERINGS ARE ARGUING THEIR

01:40:28.622 --> 01:40:30.224
NUTRITIONAL VALUE THIS BILL

01:40:30.290 --> 01:40:32.259
HOWEVER APPLIES TO MANY PRODUCTS

01:40:32.326 --> 01:40:33.694
INCLUDING THOSE THAT HAVE

01:40:33.761 --> 01:40:35.829
NUTRITIONAL VALUE THIS IS NOT

01:40:35.896 --> 01:40:38.999
JUST LIMITED TO SODA THIS IS ANY.

01:40:39.066 --> 01:40:41.435
BEVERAGE THERE ARE.

01:40:41.502 --> 01:40:42.336
PEPSICO MAKES TROPICANA JUICE.

01:40:42.403 --> 01:40:43.203
YEAH WE HAVE A PRODUCT CALLED

01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:45.072
DROPPED FIFTY WHERE WE TAKE 50%

01:40:45.139 --> 01:40:46.206
OF THE NATIONAL RECURRING SUGAR

01:40:46.273 --> 01:40:48.275
OUT WHY BECAUSE IT'S A LOT OF

01:40:48.342 --> 01:40:50.277
CALORIES IN A 100% FRUIT JUICE.

01:40:50.344 --> 01:40:52.012
AND WE REPLACE THAT THAT

01:40:52.079 --> 01:40:54.348
NATURALLY OCCURRING SUGAR WITH

01:40:54.415 --> 01:40:55.082
SOME SWEETENER THAT BOOK THAT

01:40:55.149 --> 01:40:55.916
PRODUCT WOULD CARRY A WARNING

01:40:55.983 --> 01:40:57.518
LABEL ON THAT PRODUCT HAS PLENTY

01:40:57.584 --> 01:40:59.052
OF NUTRITIONAL VALUE SO AGAIN.

01:40:59.119 --> 01:41:00.821
IT'S NOT A UNIFORM APPLICATION

01:41:00.888 --> 01:41:03.390
THAT WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT --

01:41:03.457 --> 01:41:05.426
SODA POP SURE AND I UNDERSTAND

01:41:05.492 --> 01:41:07.594
WITH THE REALLY IS FOR EXAMPLE

01:41:07.661 --> 01:41:13.734
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PRODUCT LINE.

01:41:13.801 --> 01:41:16.403
BUT THE THE THE GAS STATIONS I

01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:17.504
GUESS THE ASSOCIATION IS THE

01:41:17.571 --> 01:41:18.939
FUEL CONVENES ASSOCIATION.

01:41:19.006 --> 01:41:19.907
THEY DON'T MAKE THEIR OWN

01:41:19.973 --> 01:41:23.710
PRODUCTS DO THEY DEPENDS I AGAIN

01:41:23.777 --> 01:41:24.278
I DON'T REPRESENT THEM SO I

01:41:24.344 --> 01:41:24.945
CAN'T SPEAK TO A BUT I HAVE BEEN

01:41:25.012 --> 01:41:26.647
IN SOME OF THOSE THOSE -- STORES

01:41:26.713 --> 01:41:29.283
I BELIEVE PERHAPS EXTRA MILE HAS

01:41:29.349 --> 01:41:30.617
THEIR OWN I THINK SEVEN I KNOW

01:41:30.684 --> 01:41:33.287
SEVEN LEVIN AS OUR OWN BRAND IT

01:41:33.353 --> 01:41:35.422
VARIES ACROSS THE BOARD.

01:41:35.489 --> 01:41:36.590
AND IT AND THEN AS FAR AS THE

01:41:36.657 --> 01:41:38.759
THE MANUFACTURING IN THE JOB

01:41:38.826 --> 01:41:39.526
SINGLE AND AND THESE OTHER

01:41:39.593 --> 01:41:41.261
ARGUMENTS.

01:41:41.328 --> 01:41:42.863
IN AS A WHOLE I WANTED TO IF IF

01:41:42.930 --> 01:41:43.497
THROUGH THE MISTER CHAIR IF WE

01:41:43.564 --> 01:41:44.765
CAN ALLOW.

01:41:44.832 --> 01:41:46.767
THE AUTHOR -- TO I KNOW HE'S

01:41:46.834 --> 01:41:47.367

CLICK.

01:41:47.801 --> 01:41:50.604
TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES

01:41:50.671 --> 01:41:52.339
RIGHT NOW.

01:41:52.406 --> 01:41:52.940
THANK YOU THROUGH THE CHAIR.

01:41:53.006 --> 01:41:54.942
SO I THINK THE MANUFACTURING

01:41:55.008 --> 01:41:56.710
CONCERNS ARE EXAGGERATED WE'VE

01:41:56.777 --> 01:41:58.378
ALREADY SEEN A DIVERSIFICATION

01:41:58.445 --> 01:41:59.713
OF PRODUCTS.

01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:00.581
I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT THE

01:42:00.647 --> 01:42:01.915
DATA SHOWS A REDUCTION IN

01:42:01.982 --> 01:42:03.951
CONSUMPTION OF SODA PRODUCTS

01:42:04.017 --> 01:42:05.152
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS WHAT WE

01:42:05.219 --> 01:42:07.054
CALL CAMOUFLAGE PRODUCTS SPORT

01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:08.388
T..

01:42:08.455 --> 01:42:10.257
ENERGY DRINKS NO NUTRITIONAL

01:42:10.324 --> 01:42:13.794
VALUE HI LOADED SUGAR CONTENT

01:42:13.861 --> 01:42:16.063
BUT TO THE QUESTION ON

01:42:16.129 --> 01:42:18.732
MANUFACTURING.

01:42:18.799 --> 01:42:21.969
IF YOU LOOK AT PRODUCTS.

01:42:22.035 --> 01:42:23.937
THAT WOULD CARRY THIS LABEL.

01:42:24.004 --> 01:42:25.639
CAN TO BEVERAGES BOTTLED

01:42:25.706 --> 01:42:27.307
BEVERAGES.

01:42:27.374 --> 01:42:28.308
IF YOU GO TO THE STORE THIS

01:42:28.375 --> 01:42:29.943

YOU'LL SEE HOLIDAY LABELS.

01:42:40.554 --> 01:42:43.323
THE INDUSTRY IS ADEPT THEY

01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:44.958
CHANGE THEIR LABELS FREQUENTLY.

01:42:45.025 --> 01:42:46.326
THIS IS NOT GOING TO PUT THEM

01:42:46.393 --> 01:42:50.797
OUT OF BUSINESS.

01:42:50.864 --> 01:42:52.966
IN THROUGH THE CHAIR IF IF I

01:42:53.033 --> 01:42:56.670
COULD JUST ASK THE DOCTOR TO

01:42:56.737 --> 01:42:58.071
RESPOND TO THE QUESTION.

01:42:58.138 --> 01:43:02.676
THAT WAS ASKED TO THE OPPOSITION.

01:43:02.743 --> 01:43:04.177
OUT OUT OUT HOW WELL DO THAT

01:43:04.244 --> 01:43:05.679
FREQUENT PLEASE THANK YOU THANK

01:43:05.746 --> 01:43:07.080
YOU -- THE THE QUESTIONING IN

01:43:07.147 --> 01:43:08.081
TERMSOF THE CONSUMPTION OF

01:43:08.148 --> 01:43:09.650
SUGAR THOSE DATA THAT OUR

01:43:09.716 --> 01:43:10.751
NATIONAL DON'T NECESSARILY

01:43:10.817 --> 01:43:12.753
REFLECT THE TRENDS ARE HAPPENING

01:43:12.819 --> 01:43:13.654
HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:15.289
WE PUBLISHED A STUDY WITH UCLA

01:43:15.355 --> 01:43:16.557
LAST YEAR SHOWING THAT THE

01:43:16.623 --> 01:43:18.425
SUGARY DRINK CONSUMPTION AMONG

01:43:18.492 --> 01:43:20.627
CHILDREN IS ACTUALLY INCREASING --

01:43:20.694 --> 01:43:22.329
AND THAT KIDS AS YOUNG AS TWO OR

01:43:22.396 --> 01:43:23.530
INCREASED.

01:43:23.597 --> 01:43:24.464
I'M CONSUMING SUGARY DRINKS AND

01:43:24.531 --> 01:43:25.999
THE SUGARY DRINKS OUR DRINKS

01:43:26.066 --> 01:43:27.834
THAT ARE MASKED AS THE SENATOR

01:43:27.901 --> 01:43:28.869
MENTIONED -- ONES THAT PARENTS

01:43:28.936 --> 01:43:31.171
DON'T RECOGNIZE AS SUGARY DRINKS

01:43:31.238 --> 01:43:32.773
ESPECIALLY ENERGY DRINKS IS HIGH

01:43:32.839 --> 01:43:34.908
IN THEIR AND YOU'LL REMEMBER

01:43:34.975 --> 01:43:36.243
THAT -- THAT WE PASSED

01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:37.945
LEGISLATION DETERMINING THAT IN

01:43:38.011 --> 01:43:40.147
SCHOOLS -- MANY SUGARY DRINKS

01:43:40.213 --> 01:43:41.748
CAN'T BE SOLD EXCEPT ENERGY

01:43:41.815 --> 01:43:42.916
DRINKS WERE CARVE OUT AND SO

01:43:42.983 --> 01:43:43.550
WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE IN THOSE

01:43:43.617 --> 01:43:44.952
DRINKS BECAUSE THEY WERE LEFT

01:43:45.018 --> 01:43:46.286
BEHIND AND FORTUNATELY -- THE

01:43:46.353 --> 01:43:47.988
OTHER THING THAT THAT REALLY

01:43:48.055 --> 01:43:49.156
WASN'T MENTIONED WAS THE FACT

01:43:49.222 --> 01:43:51.191
THAT THE ONE WE WILL DOESN'T

01:43:51.258 --> 01:43:52.326
JUST FOCUS ON OBESITY THE

01:43:52.392 --> 01:43:53.260
MORNING LIVE ALSO FOCUS ON

01:43:53.327 --> 01:43:55.028
DIABETES AND CAVITIES I DON'T

01:43:55.095 --> 01:43:55.696
THINK THE OPPOSITION WOULD WOULD

01:43:55.762 --> 01:43:57.230
LEVY AN ARGUMENT THAT THEIR

01:43:57.297 --> 01:43:58.498
PRODUCTS DON'T CONTRIBUTED THOSE

01:43:58.565 --> 01:43:59.600
AND THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

01:43:59.666 --> 01:44:00.734
THAT'S LEADING TO THE TRENDS

01:44:00.801 --> 01:44:01.735
THAT WE'RE SEEING IN TERMS OF

01:44:01.802 --> 01:44:03.704
DENTAL DENTAL HEALTH -- AS WELL

01:44:03.770 --> 01:44:05.238
AS DIABETES IN THE STATE SO IT'S

01:44:05.305 --> 01:44:06.773
IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT FOR

01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:08.075
PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIABETES OR WHO

01:44:08.141 --> 01:44:10.611
ARE AT RISK FOR DIABETES 46% OF

01:44:10.677 --> 01:44:12.512
OUR STATE HAS PRE DIABETES.

01:44:12.579 --> 01:44:13.380
THAT CONSUMING ONE SUGARY DRINK

01:44:13.447 --> 01:44:15.215
A DAY IS BASICALLY SAYING YOU'RE

01:44:15.282 --> 01:44:17.150
GOING TO DEVELOP DIABETES --

01:44:17.217 --> 01:44:19.119
THAT THAT IS CONTRIBUTING TO AN

01:44:19.186 --> 01:44:20.520
ALREADY RISK ALREADY HIGH RISK

01:44:20.587 --> 01:44:23.090
POPULATION AND 46% OF OUR STATE

01:44:23.156 --> 01:44:24.391
IS A MATTER THAT STATUS IN

01:44:24.458 --> 01:44:26.193
ADDITION IT DOUBLES THE RISK OF

01:44:26.259 --> 01:44:26.960
CAVITIES.

01:44:27.027 --> 01:44:28.328
SO WHAT FOCUSING ON OBESITY IS

01:44:28.395 --> 01:44:29.663
CONVENIENT BECAUSE CERTAINLY

01:44:29.730 --> 01:44:31.365
PEOPLE WHO ARE OBESE STRUGGLE

01:44:31.431 --> 01:44:33.033
LOSING WEIGHT WE ALL RECOGNIZE

01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:34.635
THAT SO PEOPLE MAKE CONTINUE OR

01:44:34.701 --> 01:44:36.036
MAY EVEN STOP DRINKING BUT STILL

01:44:36.103 --> 01:44:36.837
MAY NOT LOSE WEIGHT AND SO

01:44:36.903 --> 01:44:38.238
THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY

01:44:38.305 --> 01:44:39.373
THERE'S A TIME LAG.

01:44:39.439 --> 01:44:40.140
IN CDC DATA LOOKING AT

01:44:40.207 --> 01:44:41.808
CONSUMPTION AND OBESITY WE ARE

01:44:41.875 --> 01:44:43.043
GOING TO IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME

01:44:43.110 --> 01:44:43.977
FOR THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN THEY

01:44:44.044 --> 01:44:45.245
DON'T HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY UP AT

01:44:45.312 --> 01:44:46.780
THE SAME TIME THAT YOU STOPPED

01:44:46.847 --> 01:44:47.514
DRINKING A BEVERAGE.

01:44:47.581 --> 01:44:48.348
THAT YOUR WEIGHT SUDDENLY

01:44:48.415 --> 01:44:49.983
BECOMES NORMAL BUT AT THE SAME

01:44:50.050 --> 01:44:51.351
TIME WE'RE ALSO NOT RECOGNIZING

01:44:51.418 --> 01:44:53.587
THAT OBESITY IS BUT ONE OF THE

01:44:53.654 --> 01:44:54.254
THREE THINGS THAT ARE CALLED OUT

01:44:54.321 --> 01:44:56.356
ON THE LABEL AS BEING A DIRECT

01:44:56.423 --> 01:44:57.491
CONSEQUENCE OF THIS.

01:44:57.557 --> 01:44:58.525
THINGS THAT ARE HARMING THE

01:44:58.592 --> 01:45:05.999
HEALTH AND AS WE AS WE SHOWN

01:45:06.066 --> 01:45:08.969
THERE ARE DAY EIGHT A SHOWING

01:45:09.036 --> 01:45:10.003
THAT PARENTS WHEN THEY ARE WHEN

01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.570
THEY SEE A WARNING LABEL AS

01:45:10.637 --> 01:45:11.738
COMPARED TO THAT CLEAR ON

01:45:11.805 --> 01:45:12.606
CALORIES.

01:45:12.673 --> 01:45:13.273
THAT THE EVERY BEVERAGE INDUSTRY

01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:13.940
DID THAT THEY ACTUALLY DO BEGIN

01:45:14.007 --> 01:45:14.508
TO RECOGNIZE AND MAKE THOSE

01:45:14.574 --> 01:45:15.676
CHANGES AND SO THAT'S THE DATA

01:45:15.742 --> 01:45:17.310
COMPONENT OF IT THAT IS MISSING

01:45:17.377 --> 01:45:20.480
AND IN THE ARGUMENT.

01:45:20.547 --> 01:45:23.517
THANK YOU MISTER MESS

01:45:23.583 --> 01:45:23.817
[inaudible]

01:45:23.884 --> 01:45:26.286
SO.

01:45:26.353 --> 01:45:27.621
I'M I'M STRUGGLING ACTUALLY THE

01:45:27.688 --> 01:45:29.289
DISK SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT

01:45:29.356 --> 01:45:30.557
ARE BEING MADE -- BOTH PRO AND

01:45:30.624 --> 01:45:32.693
CON SEEMED TO TO LEAVE ME

01:45:32.759 --> 01:45:35.796
WANTING -- FOR FOR MORE --

01:45:35.862 --> 01:45:38.098
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW FINANCED

01:45:38.165 --> 01:45:39.599
SOLELY BY THE MANUFACTURES

01:45:39.666 --> 01:45:40.834
ARGUMENT BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE

01:45:40.901 --> 01:45:42.235
RIGHT A SENATOR THAT THOSE

01:45:42.302 --> 01:45:43.270
LABELS.

01:45:43.336 --> 01:45:47.240
GET CHANGE ON A REGULAR BASIS --

01:45:47.307 --> 01:45:48.909
I DO STRUGGLE AND WE HAD THIS

01:45:48.975 --> 01:45:52.012
CONVERSATION YESTERDAY -- WITH --

01:45:52.079 --> 01:45:53.413
WHY THE LABELS WHAT WHY WE

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:56.550
CHOOSE -- SOME PRODUCTS AND NOT.

01:45:56.616 --> 01:45:59.152
ALL THE PRODUCTS -- ONE OF THEM

01:45:59.219 --> 01:46:01.288
BEING CHOCOLATE MILK -- I SHARED

01:46:01.354 --> 01:46:03.290
WITH YOU -- LE STORY HAVE A VERY

01:46:03.356 --> 01:46:03.790
CLOSE FRIEND AND IT'S A

PEDIATRIC DENTIST AND SO -- I

OFTEN TIMES WE'LL SEE A MOUTH

01:46:09.162 --> 01:46:10.897
FULL OF FROM KIDS THAT ARE

01:46:10.964 --> 01:46:14.401

01:46:15.102 --> 01:46:16.103
OLD.

01:46:16.169 --> 01:46:19.039
AND IT'S BECAUSE MOMS THINKING

01:46:19.106 --> 01:46:21.007
THAT -- CHOCOLATE MILK THAT HAS

01:46:21.074 --> 01:46:23.143
ORGANIC ON THE LABEL IS HEALTHY

01:46:23.210 --> 01:46:25.579
FOR THEIR KIDS JUST BECAUSE THE

01:46:25.645 --> 01:46:26.513
WAY THAT IT'S LABELED IT SAYS

01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:29.516
ORGANIC AND THEY THINK OSIS

01:46:29.583 --> 01:46:30.884
HEALTHY IT'S IT'S MILK IT'S GOT

01:46:30.951 --> 01:46:34.321
A NUTRITIONAL VALUE WHEN IN FACT.

01:46:34.387 --> 01:46:36.056
IT ISN'T HEALTHY FOR THE KIDS

01:46:36.123 --> 01:46:41.595
THE IT'S APPLE JUICE IS NOT.

01:46:41.661 --> 01:46:42.362
JUICE IS NOT HELD IS OUR

01:46:42.429 --> 01:46:45.899
NUTRITIONAL VALUE YES -- BUT IT

ISN'T -- HEALTHY A FOR KIDS ARE

01:46:48.635 --> 01:46:49.836
SOME THINGS THAT ARE HEALTHY BUT

THEY'RE NOT IT'S NOT ALL HEALTHY

01:46:50.570 --> 01:46:53.740
I THINK OF OF OF THE AMERICAN

01:46:53.807 --> 01:46:56.576
DIET MY DIET I DRINK A KNOW

01:46:56.643 --> 01:46:57.744
SUGARED SODAS.

01:46:57.811 --> 01:46:59.045
DIET COKE EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE A

01:46:59.112 --> 01:46:59.880
DIET COKE ISN'T GOING TO BE

01:46:59.946 --> 01:47:01.581
LABELED BUT I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE

01:47:01.648 --> 01:47:03.483
THAT A DIET COKE IS HEALTHY. FOR

01:47:03.550 --> 01:47:04.718
ME BUT THIS LABEL WHAT BE ON A

01:47:04.785 --> 01:47:06.620
ON A DIET COKE BUT IT WOULD BE

01:47:06.686 --> 01:47:09.656
ON A ON A COCA COLA THAT'S

01:47:09.723 --> 01:47:10.490
THAT'S THERE.

01:47:10.557 --> 01:47:12.425
AND SO I I WONDER IF THIS IS

01:47:12.492 --> 01:47:15.729
REALLY -- WHAT WE -- IT IS THE

01:47:15.796 --> 01:47:18.265
ANSWER -- THE ONE QUESTION IF I

01:47:18.331 --> 01:47:20.100
CAN ACTUALLY TO A TO THE TO THE

01:47:20.167 --> 01:47:29.776
OPPOSITION I ASK THIS THIS

01:47:29.843 --> 01:47:31.144
QUESTION.

01:47:31.211 --> 01:47:31.978
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE THAT THE

01:47:32.045 --> 01:47:33.480
TAX ON SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES.

01:47:33.547 --> 01:47:35.315
BUT BECAUSE DURING THAT TIME I

01:47:35.382 --> 01:47:37.150
ASKED THE QUESTION WELL -- IF IT

01:47:37.217 --> 01:47:38.151
TAX ISN'T THE ANSWER BUT WHAT'S

01:47:38.218 --> 01:47:38.785
THE ANSWER WILL EDUCATION IS THE

01:47:38.852 --> 01:47:39.419
ANSWER.

01:47:39.486 --> 01:47:41.688
WHAT WHAT HOW DO WE DO EDUCATION

01:47:41.755 --> 01:47:42.756
THEN IF IT'S NOT WITH THE LABEL

01:47:42.823 --> 01:47:43.723
AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THE LABEL

01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:45.458
IN OF ITSELF AS THE BEST LABEL --

01:47:45.525 --> 01:47:47.360
TOOK TO LIST ON ON A CAN BUT HOW

01:47:47.427 --> 01:47:49.963
DO WE EDUCATE PEOPLE THAT --

01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:50.530
THAT THERE YOU'RE TAKING AND

01:47:50.597 --> 01:47:52.032
THAT MUCH SUGAR WHEN YOU'RE WHEN

01:47:52.098 --> 01:47:53.233
YOU'RE DRINKING A COKE OR OR A

01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:54.701
PEPSI -- HOW DO WE EDUCATE

01:47:54.768 --> 01:47:57.437
PEOPLE THAT THAT BANANA NOT MOM

01:47:57.504 --> 01:48:00.674
A MUFFIN AT STARBUCKS HAS A TON

01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:02.108
OF SUGAR INTO THAT YOU SHOULDN'T

01:48:02.175 --> 01:48:03.009
BE EATING HOW DO WE?

01:48:03.076 --> 01:48:05.378
HOW DO WE EDUCATE IF THIS ISN'T

01:48:05.445 --> 01:48:06.746
THE ANSWER THEN THEN WHAT AT

01:48:06.813 --> 01:48:08.048
WHAT POINT DOES THE INDUSTRY

01:48:08.114 --> 01:48:09.182
WHAT WHAT IS IT THE INDUSTRY

01:48:09.249 --> 01:48:10.884
WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE?

01:48:10.951 --> 01:48:13.186
OF IT IS TO TO GET THE WORD OUT

01:48:13.253 --> 01:48:15.222
THAT PEOPLE ARE CONSUMING. TOO

01:48:15.288 --> 01:48:16.723
MUCH SUGAR -- THAT THAT IT IS

01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:18.058
HAVING AN IMPACT ON TYPE TWO

01:48:18.124 --> 01:48:20.794
DIABETES-- IT IS HAVING AN

01:48:20.861 --> 01:48:22.028
IMPACT ON TWO TWO K. -- WHAT IS

01:48:22.095 --> 01:48:26.433
THE ANSWER IF IF THE LABEL -- IS

01:48:26.499 --> 01:48:30.136
IS NOT A SOME OF OUR WORKING.

01:48:30.203 --> 01:48:31.404
JOHN LET IT RUN HAVE CALIFORNIA

01:48:31.471 --> 01:48:32.806
RETAILERS ASSOCIATION OF PEPSICO --

01:48:32.873 --> 01:48:33.773
I DO THINK.

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:35.609
THAT THE PROBLEM THAT THAT YOU

01:48:35.675 --> 01:48:36.376
POSE.

01:48:36.443 --> 01:48:38.411
AS SOMEONE MAKE MAZES IS REAL

01:48:38.478 --> 01:48:39.379
AND IT'S A CHALLENGE FOR ALL OF

01:48:39.446 --> 01:48:40.146
US I DO THINK THE MOVE TOWARDS

01:48:40.213 --> 01:48:41.481
CLEAR ON CALORIES AS AN ATTEMPT

01:48:41.548 --> 01:48:42.349
TO TRY TO BE CLEAR WITH

01:48:42.415 --> 01:48:43.650
CONSUMERS ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE

01:48:43.717 --> 01:48:44.584
CONSUMING.

01:48:44.651 --> 01:48:47.220
IN TERMS OF CALORIC INTAKE I DO

01:48:47.287 --> 01:48:50.290
THINK THE PROBLEM YOU KNOW IT IS

01:48:50.357 --> 01:48:50.857
GOES BACK EVEN TO A MISTER

01:48:50.924 --> 01:48:52.092
MCCARTY WAS TALKING ABOUT IF WE

01:48:52.158 --> 01:48:53.827
ASKED MOST KIDS AND PROBABLY

01:48:53.894 --> 01:48:54.728
THREE ASKED ALL THE MEMBERS FROM

01:48:54.794 --> 01:48:55.762
THE DíAS WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T

01:48:55.829 --> 01:48:57.464
KNOW WHAT OUR IDEAL CALORIC

01:48:57.530 --> 01:48:58.031
INTAKE FOR EACH ONE OF US.

01:48:58.098 --> 01:48:58.899
IS.

01:48:58.965 --> 01:49:00.567
SO PART OF THE PROBLEM IS NOT

01:49:00.634 --> 01:49:02.535
JUST SIMPLY THAT -- DO I KNOW

01:49:02.602 --> 01:49:03.837
WHAT'S IN THAT PRODUCT TO DO I

01:49:03.904 --> 01:49:05.972
KNOW OF THAT OF OF THAT HOW MUCH

01:49:06.039 --> 01:49:07.707
I'M SUPPOSED TO HAVE THIS LABEL

01:49:07.774 --> 01:49:09.109
DOESN'T GIVE ANY INFORMATION.

01:49:09.175 --> 01:49:10.410
CORD THAT IT JUST SIMPLY SAYS

01:49:10.477 --> 01:49:12.245
THAT THAT PRODUCT IS HARMFUL

01:49:12.312 --> 01:49:13.947
DOESN'T SAY HOW IT'S HARMFUL --

01:49:14.014 --> 01:49:15.115
SO IT JUST SAYS IT HAS ADDED

01:49:15.181 --> 01:49:16.216
SUGARS I MEAN EVERYTHING HAS

01:49:16.283 --> 01:49:20.854
ADDED SUGARS IS HARMFUL -- I

01:49:20.921 --> 01:49:21.488
DON'T HAVE A GOOD ANSWER FOR YOU

01:49:21.554 --> 01:49:22.088
I KNOW WHAT THE INDUSTRY HAS

01:49:22.155 --> 01:49:22.756
BEEN DOING THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN

01:49:22.822 --> 01:49:24.491
AGGRESSIVELY GOING FORTH IN

01:49:24.557 --> 01:49:25.959
BRINGING OUT NEW PRODUCTS.

01:49:26.026 --> 01:49:27.460
AND WE AGAIN AS I SAID BEORE WE

01:49:27.527 --> 01:49:29.162
NOW HAVE 50% OF THE PRODUCTS

01:49:29.229 --> 01:49:30.397
SOLD OUR ZERO CALORIE PRODUCTS

01:49:30.463 --> 01:49:32.065
THAT IS A MOVE IN THE RIGHT

01:49:32.132 --> 01:49:32.666
DIRECTION BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT

01:49:32.732 --> 01:49:33.500
CONSUMERS WANT.

01:49:33.566 --> 01:49:34.567
THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN IN

01:49:34.634 --> 01:49:36.670
MAGICALLY COMING UP WITH A

01:49:36.736 --> 01:49:37.737
PUBLIC POLICY FROM THE STATE OF

01:49:37.804 --> 01:49:39.472
CALIFORNIA THAT SAYS THIS IS WHY

01:49:39.539 --> 01:49:40.840
WE KNOW EVERYBODY WILL HAVE THE

01:49:40.907 --> 01:49:43.109
RIGHT BIT OF INFORMATION --

01:49:43.176 --> 01:49:43.743
THAT'S HARD AND I DON'T HAVE AN

01:49:43.810 --> 01:49:44.611
ANSWER FOR THAT.

01:49:44.678 --> 01:49:45.712
SORRY THIS IS.

01:49:45.779 --> 01:49:47.781
LEAVING YOU WANTING BUT THIS

01:49:47.847 --> 01:49:48.748
WARNING LABEL THAT WE'RE

01:49:48.815 --> 01:49:49.549
DESCRIBING ALSO DOESN'T HAVE

01:49:49.616 --> 01:49:50.984
INFORMATION FOR THE CONSUMER

01:49:51.051 --> 01:49:52.218
JUST SIMPLY TELL THEM NOT TO

01:49:52.285 --> 01:49:53.219
TOUCH A CERTAIN PRODUCT.

01:49:53.286 --> 01:49:54.888
THERE'S NO CONTEXT FOR WHAT THEY

01:49:54.955 --> 01:49:56.256
SHOULD BE LOOKING AT OR HOW MUCH

01:49:56.323 --> 01:49:57.324
OF IT THAT THEY SHOULD BE

01:49:57.390 --> 01:49:58.625
LOOKING AT MY SUPPOSED TO HAVE

01:49:58.692 --> 01:49:59.392
TWO THOUSAND CALORIES A TWENTY

01:49:59.459 --> 01:50:00.427
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS.

01:50:00.493 --> 01:50:01.728
IF I EXERCISE A LITTLE BIT OR A

01:50:01.795 --> 01:50:02.562
LOT ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE

01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:04.631
FACTORS.

01:50:04.698 --> 01:50:05.231
THAT GO INTO WHAT YOU SHOULD

01:50:05.298 --> 01:50:06.733
CONSUME OF ANY PRODUCT WITH

01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:10.804
CALORIES NOT JUST THIS PRODUCT

01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:13.873
WITH CALORIES.

01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:15.709
IS IT.

01:50:15.775 --> 01:50:16.943
CENTERED.

01:50:17.010 --> 01:50:18.144
SHOULD THIS BE DONE ON THE

01:50:18.211 --> 01:50:19.980
FEDERAL LEVEL -- TO HAVE SOME

01:50:20.046 --> 01:50:20.613
MA'AM IS THIS SOMETHING THAT.

01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:21.247
THEY SHOULD BE DOING BACK BACK

01:50:21.314 --> 01:50:22.949
IN WASHINGTON THAT SPREAD ACROSS

01:50:23.016 --> 01:50:24.951
THE COUNTRY WHAT WHY CALIFORNIA

01:50:25.018 --> 01:50:27.854
WHY SHOULD WE BE SPECIAL -- WITH

01:50:27.921 --> 01:50:29.489
THIS WELL IT'S A FAIR QUESTION

01:50:29.556 --> 01:50:30.657
WE HAVE A UNIQUE PROBLEM IN

01:50:30.724 --> 01:50:32.625
CALIFORNIA WITH THE TRENDS OF

01:50:32.692 --> 01:50:34.995
PREVENTABLE TYPE TWO DIABETES

01:50:35.061 --> 01:50:37.063
WE'VE ALSO BEEN A PIONEER IN

01:50:37.130 --> 01:50:38.264
OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH.

01:50:38.331 --> 01:50:40.000
AREAS I WOULD SUGGEST THAT

01:50:40.066 --> 01:50:40.967
WAITING FOR THE FEDERAL

01:50:41.034 --> 01:50:42.268
GOVERNMENT TO ACT WOULD BE

01:50:42.335 --> 01:50:45.138
TANTAMOUNT. TO NOT TAKING ACTION

01:50:45.205 --> 01:50:47.841
ON WHAT IS A PROVEN PUBLIC

01:50:47.907 --> 01:50:49.743
HEALTH EPIDEMIC AND IF I MIGHT

01:50:49.809 --> 01:50:51.044
JUST THROUGH THE CHAIR ADDRESS

01:50:51.111 --> 01:50:53.246
THE OTHER PART OF YOUR QUESTION

01:50:53.313 --> 01:50:54.781
DIRECTED TO THE INDUSTRY TO

01:50:54.848 --> 01:50:56.583
PLEASE YOU THANK YOU -- SO THE

01:50:56.649 --> 01:50:58.051
CHOCOLATE MILK CONSUMPTION WHICH

01:50:58.118 --> 01:51:00.053
WE DESCRIBED THERE IS A BIG

01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:01.187
DIFFERENCE I'M NOT HERE'S A

01:51:01.254 --> 01:51:02.989
PROPONENT OF CHOCOLATE MILK FOR

01:51:03.056 --> 01:51:06.693
CHILDREN THERE IS PROTEIN IN

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:07.460
MILK PRODUCTS.

01:51:07.527 --> 01:51:10.530
THE VAST MAJORITY OF BEVERAGES

01:51:10.597 --> 01:51:12.165
THAT WOULD EARN THIS LABEL.

01:51:12.232 --> 01:51:14.834
HAVE NO NUTRITIONAL VALUE.

01:51:14.901 --> 01:51:17.037
IN MANY ARE DISGUISED VITAMIN

01:51:17.103 --> 01:51:18.972
WATER THAT A PARENT MIGHT BUY

01:51:19.039 --> 01:51:20.607
FOR THEIR CHILD THINKING.

01:51:20.673 --> 01:51:21.574
GREAT VITAMIN WATERING TO MAKE

01:51:21.641 --> 01:51:23.977
SURE MY CHILD HAS ALL OF HIS OR

01:51:24.044 --> 01:51:25.211
HER VITAMINS.

01:51:25.278 --> 01:51:27.647
THOSE PRODUCTS INCLUDE SUGARS TO

01:51:27.714 --> 01:51:29.949
THE LEVEL THAT WOULD EARN THE

01:51:30.016 --> 01:51:33.053
LABEL ON THE OPPONENT ARGUES

01:51:33.119 --> 01:51:35.255
THAT THE LABEL WOULD STIGMATIZE

01:51:35.321 --> 01:51:36.089
THE PRODUCT AND NOBODY WOULD BUY

01:51:36.156 --> 01:51:38.358
IT -- I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD

01:51:38.425 --> 01:51:40.860
BE THE RESULT AS I SAID EARLIER.

01:51:40.927 --> 01:51:42.896
THE LABEL DOESN'T RAISE THE COST

01:51:42.962 --> 01:51:45.165
IT DOESN'T REMOVE IT FROM FROM

01:51:45.231 --> 01:51:47.167
THE MARKET PLACE IT INFORMS

01:51:47.233 --> 01:51:51.137
CHOICE SOME PEOPLE.

01:51:51.204 --> 01:51:52.539
MAY INFORMED CHOICE.

01:51:52.605 --> 01:51:53.573
THEY MAY EXERCISE MORE

01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:55.108
MODERATION.

01:51:55.175 --> 01:51:56.676
THEY MAY CHOOSE ONLY TO BUY

01:51:56.743 --> 01:51:58.344
THOSE BEVERAGES FOR A SPECIAL

01:51:58.411 --> 01:52:00.480
OCCASION AS OPPOSED TO A STAPLE

01:52:00.547 --> 01:52:01.948
IN THE DIET.

01:52:02.015 --> 01:52:03.383
SO I THINK [inaudible]

01:52:03.450 --> 01:52:06.019
WE CAN.

01:52:06.086 --> 01:52:08.088
SPLIT HAIRS AS TO WHAT'S COVERED

01:52:08.154 --> 01:52:10.723
WHAT'S NOT COVERED SCIENCE NOT

01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:13.159
POLITICIANS HAVE CONCLUDED.

01:52:13.226 --> 01:52:14.694
THAT THE CONSUMPTION.

01:52:14.761 --> 01:52:18.164
OF LIQUID SUGAR IS METABOLIZED

01:52:18.231 --> 01:52:20.700
IN A DIFFERENT MANNER THAN SUGAR

01:52:20.767 --> 01:52:22.068
THE TEEN FOOD PRODUCTS.

01:52:22.135 --> 01:52:25.672
THAT THE BODY DIGESTS ELIMINATES.

01:52:25.738 --> 01:52:27.774
THE LIQUID SUGAR.

01:52:27.841 --> 01:52:29.275
MAKES THE PANCREAS THE KIDNEYS

01:52:29.342 --> 01:52:31.945
WORK OVERTIME CONVERTS THAT

01:52:32.011 --> 01:52:33.980
SUGAR TO FAT.

01:52:34.047 --> 01:52:35.081
MESSENGER JUST ONE MORE QUESTION

01:52:35.148 --> 01:52:36.716
TO TALK ABOUT THE LABELING AND

01:52:36.783 --> 01:52:39.018
IN A SPLITTING HAIRS I THINK OF

01:52:39.085 --> 01:52:41.654
SMOOTHIES -- I THINK THERE'S I'M

01:52:41.721 --> 01:52:43.223
THINKING OF ON WALL OF BEING ONE

01:52:43.289 --> 01:52:46.526
ONE BRAND -- THAT THERE ARE LOTS

01:52:46.593 --> 01:52:47.760
OF FRUIT AND IN THEM HI

01:52:47.827 --> 01:52:49.262
NUTRITIONAL VALUE.

01:52:49.329 --> 01:52:50.997
BUT SOME OF THEM HAVE ADDED

01:52:51.064 --> 01:52:52.999
SUGARS THAT WILL BE REQUIRED TO

01:52:53.066 --> 01:52:55.301
HAVE A LABEL AND MAYBE THERE IS

01:52:55.368 --> 01:52:56.903
ONE THAT -- THE DOESN'T HAVE

01:52:56.970 --> 01:52:58.805
ADDED SUGARS WOULDN'T HAVE THE

01:52:58.872 --> 01:52:59.472
LABEL BUT ACTUALLY COULD HAVE A

01:52:59.539 --> 01:53:05.445
HIGHER SUGAR SUGAR CONTENT.

01:53:05.512 --> 01:53:07.046
ARE WE WELL THERE IS THE LABEL

01:53:07.113 --> 01:53:09.782
IS BASED ON ADDED SUGAR --

01:53:09.849 --> 01:53:12.585
FRUCTOSE SUGAR IT'S IT'S WHAT IS

01:53:12.652 --> 01:53:13.820
CALCULATED.

01:53:13.887 --> 01:53:17.157
IT WOULD CAPTURE THE SPORTY'S%

01:53:17.223 --> 01:53:18.825
THE ENERGY DRINKS AT CETERA.

01:53:18.892 --> 01:53:20.293
WEEK SAM DAIRY PRODUCTS AGAIN ON

01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:22.395
THE THEORY THAT DAIRY PRODUCTS

01:53:22.462 --> 01:53:24.030
HAVE NUTRITIONAL VALUE IN

01:53:24.097 --> 01:53:25.832
PROTEIN SOMEBODY ASKED WHAT

01:53:25.899 --> 01:53:27.433
ABOUT ALCOHOL ARE YOU GONNA PUT

01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:28.401
THIS LABEL ON ALCOHOL OTHERS

01:53:28.468 --> 01:53:30.170
HIGH CONCENTRATIONS.

01:53:30.236 --> 01:53:31.971
OF SUGAR AND ALCOHOL YOU HAVE TO

01:53:32.038 --> 01:53:34.107
BE TWENTY ONE IN CALIFORNIA. TO

01:53:34.174 --> 01:53:37.677
BUY ALCOHOL -- WE DO KERRY LABEL

01:53:37.744 --> 01:53:38.278
WARNINGS TO PROTECT PREGNANT

01:53:38.344 --> 01:53:38.912
WOMEN.

01:53:38.978 --> 01:53:41.181
ON ALCOHOL PRODUCTS WERE REALLY

01:53:41.247 --> 01:53:42.949
FOCUSED ON A HEALTH EPIDEMIC

01:53:43.016 --> 01:53:44.017
AMONG CHILDREN.

01:53:44.083 --> 01:53:45.685
THAT MY WIFE WAS A PUBLIC HEALTH

01:53:45.752 --> 01:53:48.488
PHYSICIAN REMINDS ME WHAT USED

01:53:48.555 --> 01:53:50.456
TO BE CALLED ADULT ONSET

01:53:50.523 --> 01:53:51.524
DIABETES.

01:53:51.591 --> 01:53:53.459
IT'S NO LONGER CALLED ADULT

01:53:53.526 --> 01:53:55.428
ONSET WE'RE SEEING AND TEENAGERS

01:53:55.495 --> 01:53:56.396
AND PRETEENS.

01:53:56.462 --> 01:54:00.900
AGAIN THIS ISN'T THE SOLUTION.

01:54:00.967 --> 01:54:01.734
BUT IT'S PART OF A PUBLIC HEALTH

01:54:01.801 --> 01:54:03.670
STRATEGY SUPPORTED BY ALL THE

01:54:03.736 --> 01:54:05.271
ORGANIZATIONS YOU HEARD TODAY

01:54:05.338 --> 01:54:07.941
WHO REPRESENT YOUR CONSTITUENTS.

01:54:08.007 --> 01:54:11.244
EVERY DAY IN THE SCHOOLS.

01:54:11.311 --> 01:54:13.279
IN THE CLINICS -- IN IT'S A

01:54:13.346 --> 01:54:16.382
CHOICE OF THOSE CONSTITUENTS.

01:54:16.449 --> 01:54:18.351
OVER DISTRIBUTORS OF THESE

01:54:18.418 --> 01:54:20.920
PRODUCTS WHO WILL NOT GO OUT OF

01:54:20.987 --> 01:54:22.956
BUSINESS.

01:54:23.022 --> 01:54:24.357
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

01:54:24.424 --> 01:54:27.794

01:54:36.069 --> 01:54:37.170
QUESTIONS BECAUSE THIS TO ME

01:54:37.237 --> 01:54:37.704
THIS IS PRETTY CLEAR CUT.

01:54:37.770 --> 01:54:39.272
BUT LISTENING TO SOME OF MY

01:54:39.339 --> 01:54:40.373
COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS WHICH WHO.

INPUT THAT THEY'RE PLACING ON

01:54:43.443 --> 01:54:45.545
THIS BUT I FEEL LIKE WE ASK

01:54:45.612 --> 01:54:47.347
QUESTIONS SOMETIMES TO DISSECT

01:54:47.413 --> 01:54:48.414
AN ISSUE.

01:54:48.481 --> 01:54:50.984
WHERE WE HAVE DIRECT CORRELATION

01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:53.786
OF WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON SO WHAT

01:54:53.853 --> 01:54:55.521

01:55:00.326 --> 01:55:01.961
EXPLAINED THE CORRELATION OF THE

01:55:02.028 --> 01:55:03.830
STRINGS WITH THE IMPACT THEY'RE

01:55:03.896 --> 01:55:07.267
HAVING ON DIABETES AND CAN YOU

01:55:07.333 --> 01:55:08.568

01:55:08.635 --> 01:55:09.669
VERY BRIEFLY.

01:55:09.736 --> 01:55:10.670
BECAUSE I JUST WANT TO HEAR

01:55:10.737 --> 01:55:12.238
ABOUT THAT CORRELATION WE CAN

01:55:12.305 --> 01:55:14.841
DISSECT THE ISSUES WE CAN ASK

01:55:14.907 --> 01:55:15.908
WHY.

01:55:15.975 --> 01:55:18.044
SOMETHINGS ARE NOT INCLUDED WHY

01:55:18.111 --> 01:55:19.512
OTHER THINGS ARE INCLUDED BUT AT

01:55:19.579 --> 01:55:22.282
THE END OF THE DAY WE START FROM

01:55:22.348 --> 01:55:23.616
ONE PLACE.

01:55:23.683 --> 01:55:25.918
AND WE WORK TO EXPAND FROM THERE

01:55:25.985 --> 01:55:28.021
RIGHT NOW THIS IS THE BILL WE

01:55:28.087 --> 01:55:30.189
HAVE IN FRONT OF US.

01:55:30.256 --> 01:55:32.992
THIS ISSUE IS IMPACTING SOME OF

01:55:33.059 --> 01:55:34.560
OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:55:34.627 --> 01:55:37.063
DISPROPORTIONATELY.

01:55:37.130 --> 01:55:38.898
AND SO I WANT TO HEAR THE

01:55:38.965 --> 01:55:39.832
NUMBERS.

01:55:39.899 --> 01:55:41.901
IF YOU I'M HAPPY TO RATTLE OFF

01:55:41.968 --> 01:55:42.769
FOR YOU AS WELL BUT IF YOU LIKE

01:55:42.835 --> 01:55:44.871
TO GO AHEAD AND THE FIRST SAY

01:55:44.937 --> 01:55:46.306
THE DIRECT CORRELATION.

01:55:46.372 --> 01:55:48.107
OF WHY WE'RE DOING THIS AND THE

01:55:48.174 --> 01:55:49.142
NUMBERS THAT IT IMPACTS

01:55:49.208 --> 01:55:52.278
ABSOLUTELY AND THANK YOU SO MUCH --

01:55:52.345 --> 01:55:53.813
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO SO

01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:55.782
TO BE VERY CLEAR WE ARE IN A

01:55:55.848 --> 01:55:57.684
STATE WHERE 46% OF THE

01:55:57.750 --> 01:56:00.586
POPULATION HAS PRE DIABETES OKAY

01:56:00.653 --> 01:56:03.122
AND ANOTHER 9% HAS DIABETES SO

01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:04.991
55% OF OUR STATE'S POPULATION.

01:56:05.058 --> 01:56:06.392
EITHER HAS DIABETES OR IS IN THE

01:56:06.459 --> 01:56:08.895
PIPELINE AND SO CONSUMING ONE

01:56:08.961 --> 01:56:11.230
SUGARY DRINK A DAY INCREASES THE

01:56:11.297 --> 01:56:14.334
LIKELIHOOD OF HAVING CAVITIES BY

01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:16.369
1100% IT DOUBLES YOUR LIKELIHOOD

01:56:16.436 --> 01:56:18.604
OF HAVING CAVITIES. ONE SUGARY

01:56:18.671 --> 01:56:20.006
DRINK A DAY AMONG CHILDREN

01:56:20.073 --> 01:56:21.874
INCREASES THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF

01:56:21.941 --> 01:56:26.245
BEING OBESE BY 55%. ONE SUGARY

01:56:26.312 --> 01:56:27.880
DRINK PER DAY INCREASES THEIR

01:56:27.947 --> 01:56:30.983
LIKELIHOOD OF DIABETES BY 26%

01:56:31.050 --> 01:56:31.851
AND IN ADULTS LIKELIHOOD OF

01:56:31.918 --> 01:56:34.287
DIABETES BY 27%.

01:56:34.354 --> 01:56:36.756
THOSE ARE THE DATA THAT WE HAVE

01:56:36.823 --> 01:56:38.891
SO IT ISN'T WHAT WE FOCUS ON

01:56:38.958 --> 01:56:39.492
SURE THEIR SUGAR AND LOTS OF

01:56:39.559 --> 01:56:40.460
THINGS WE CAN HAVE A BROADER

01:56:40.526 --> 01:56:41.761
CONVERSATION.

01:56:41.828 --> 01:56:43.262
THESE ARE THE THINGS WE HAVE A

01:56:43.329 --> 01:56:45.431
SCIENTIFIC BASIS TO SHOW THE

01:56:45.498 --> 01:56:48.201
LINK BETWEEN SUGARY DRINKS AND

01:56:48.267 --> 01:56:51.404
THE HEALTH OUTCOMES THAT ARE

01:56:51.471 --> 01:56:54.707
INCLUDED ON THE LABEL.

01:56:54.774 --> 01:56:55.475
DO YOU WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:56:55.541 --> 01:56:56.409
MISTER CHAIR IF YOU DON'T MIND.

01:56:56.476 --> 01:56:57.310
THANK YOU DO YOU WANT TO TALK A

01:56:57.377 --> 01:56:58.778
LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THIS

01:56:58.845 --> 01:57:00.213
IMPACTS.

01:57:00.279 --> 01:57:02.648
AFRICAN AMERICAN HISPANIC.

01:57:02.715 --> 01:57:05.518
OF OF THE COMMUNITIES.

01:57:05.585 --> 01:57:06.686
WHOEVER ELSE YOU WANT INCLUDING

01:57:06.753 --> 01:57:07.887
YOUR DEMOGRAPHIC BREAKDOWN

01:57:07.954 --> 01:57:10.623
ABSOLUTELY SO ONE OF THE THE

01:57:10.690 --> 01:57:11.357
THINGS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO

01:57:11.424 --> 01:57:13.359
RECOGNIZE IS THAT WITHIN

01:57:13.426 --> 01:57:16.596
CALIFORNIA -- MEMBERS OF OUR OUR

01:57:16.662 --> 01:57:18.431
FIRST NATION ARE NATIVE AMERICAN

01:57:18.498 --> 01:57:19.165
COMMUNITIES ARE BLACK

01:57:19.232 --> 01:57:19.832
COMMUNITIES IN A LATINO

01:57:19.899 --> 01:57:21.367
COMMUNITIES HAS SOME OF THE

01:57:21.434 --> 01:57:23.536
HIGHEST RATES OF DIABETES -- AND

01:57:23.603 --> 01:57:25.338
THAT FOR CHILDREN BORN SINCE THE

01:57:25.405 --> 01:57:27.240
YEAR TWO THOUSAND ONE IN TWO

01:57:27.306 --> 01:57:29.041
BLACK AND LATINO CHILDREN ARE

01:57:29.108 --> 01:57:30.443
SLATED TO DEVELOP DIABETES IN

01:57:30.510 --> 01:57:32.311
THEIR LIFETIME THAT'S 50% OF

01:57:32.378 --> 01:57:34.080
BOTH OF THOSE POPULATIONS THAT

01:57:34.147 --> 01:57:34.914
HAVE BEEN BORN BETTER.

01:57:34.981 --> 01:57:37.116
AGE NINETEEN AND UNDER RIGHT NOW

01:57:37.183 --> 01:57:38.484
ARE SLATED TO DEVELOP DIABETES

01:57:38.551 --> 01:57:40.653
WHEN THE WORD EPIDEMIC IS THROWN

01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:41.454
AROUND SO OFTEN AND I'M AN

01:57:41.521 --> 01:57:42.955
EPIDEMIOLOGIST BY TRAINING AND

01:57:43.022 --> 01:57:44.657
SO I'M REALLY CAUTIOUS ABOUT

01:57:44.724 --> 01:57:45.658
USING THAT WORD.

01:57:45.725 --> 01:57:47.260
WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT ONE

01:57:47.326 --> 01:57:48.895
IN TWO CHILDREN BORN AFTER A

01:57:48.961 --> 01:57:50.963
CERTAIN AGE BASICALLY EVERYONE

01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:52.365
NINETEEN AND UNDER -- THAT IS

01:57:52.432 --> 01:57:54.534
THE DEFINITION OF AN EPIDEMIC --

01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:56.068
YOU COULD NOT DESCRIBE IT IN ANY

01:57:56.135 --> 01:57:57.837
OTHER WAY THAT IT THAT MEANS

01:57:57.904 --> 01:57:59.205
THAT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT

01:57:59.272 --> 01:58:01.040
PRODUCTIVITY WE THINK ABOUT YOU

01:58:01.107 --> 01:58:02.575
KNOW WELLNESS WHEN WE THINK

01:58:02.642 --> 01:58:04.510
ABOUT THEIR LIFE EXPECTANCY --

01:58:04.577 --> 01:58:06.679
THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT HAMPERING

01:58:06.746 --> 01:58:08.481
OF THEIR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO

01:58:08.548 --> 01:58:10.216
GROW UP AND BE HEALTHY ADULTS

01:58:10.283 --> 01:58:11.517
SORRY SAY THAT AGAIN.

01:58:11.584 --> 01:58:13.252
WHAT'S THE DEFINITION OF AN

01:58:13.319 --> 01:58:15.421
EPIDEMIC AND WHAT THRESHOLD MUST

01:58:15.488 --> 01:58:16.756
THAT PASS SO TYPICALLY WE START

01:58:16.823 --> 01:58:18.458
TALKING ABOUT EPIDEMICS WHEN AT

01:58:18.524 --> 01:58:21.861
LEAST 15% OF THE POPULATION IS

01:58:21.928 --> 01:58:22.962
AFFECTED.

01:58:23.029 --> 01:58:23.596
AND WHERE ARE WE NOW WITH THIS

01:58:23.663 --> 01:58:25.364
WE ARE AT ONE INTO BLACK AND

01:58:25.431 --> 01:58:26.933
LATINO CHILDREN BORN AFTER THE

01:58:26.999 --> 01:58:28.835
YEAR TWO THOUSAND WILL LIKELY

01:58:28.901 --> 01:58:31.304
DEVELOP DIABETES.

01:58:31.370 --> 01:58:33.206
SO TO THE OPPOSITION.

01:58:33.272 --> 01:58:35.074
WITH THERE WAS THIS WAS BEFORE

01:58:35.141 --> 01:58:36.809
MY TIME HERE BUT THERE WAS SO

01:58:36.876 --> 01:58:39.645
MANY ISSUES AND CONCERNS ABOUT.

01:58:39.712 --> 01:58:41.814
OF FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS

01:58:41.881 --> 01:58:45.418
PROVIDING CALORIC INTAKE NUMBERS --

01:58:45.485 --> 01:58:46.919
I I DON'T EVEN KNOW MAYBE YOU

01:58:46.986 --> 01:58:50.523
WORKED ON SOME OF THOSE ISSUES --

01:58:50.590 --> 01:58:51.591
AT I DON'T WANT TO ASSUME.

01:58:51.657 --> 01:58:53.659
THERE WAS SO MUCH CONSTERNATION

01:58:53.726 --> 01:58:54.994
OVER THAT ISSUE THERE WAS SO

01:58:55.061 --> 01:58:57.196
MANY ATTEMPTS BUT THEN

01:58:57.263 --> 01:58:59.432
ULTIMATELY IT PASSED.

01:58:59.499 --> 01:59:01.300
AND IT'S BEEN WORKING GREAT.

01:59:01.367 --> 01:59:02.368
NEVER IN MY LIFETIME THAT I

01:59:02.435 --> 01:59:04.103
THINK MCDONALD'S WOULD BE

01:59:04.170 --> 01:59:05.338
OFFERING SALADS.

01:59:05.404 --> 01:59:06.405
IT IS.

01:59:06.472 --> 01:59:08.441
MAYBE IT HAD SOME VERSION OF A

01:59:08.508 --> 01:59:10.042
SALAD IN THE PAST AS WELL BUT

01:59:10.109 --> 01:59:11.978
THERE HAS BEEN A TREND THAT'S

01:59:12.044 --> 01:59:13.880
HELPED PUSH SO WHEN I HEAR THE

01:59:13.946 --> 01:59:17.717
QUESTION WHAT DOES THIS BILL DO.

01:59:17.783 --> 01:59:21.187
IT'LL EXACTLY DO WHAT IT FORCED

01:59:21.254 --> 01:59:22.755
TO HAPPEN IN THE FAST FOOD

01:59:22.822 --> 01:59:27.293
INDUSTRY -- WHICH IS HEALTHIER

01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:30.096
OUTCOMES.

01:59:30.162 --> 01:59:31.230
NONE OF THE BUSINESSES SHUT DOWN.

01:59:31.297 --> 01:59:32.398
NONE OF THE FAST FOOD PLACES

01:59:32.465 --> 01:59:33.799
WENT AWAY [inaudible]

01:59:33.866 --> 01:59:36.469
THEY'RE THRIVING.

01:59:36.536 --> 01:59:38.137
AND EVEN DOING A GREAT JOB BUT

01:59:38.204 --> 01:59:39.705
AT LEAST THE PRODUCT THAT

01:59:39.772 --> 01:59:40.573
THEY'VE BEEN.

01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:43.910
SERVING HAS IMPROVED OVER TIME.

01:59:43.976 --> 01:59:45.077
I DON'T THINK ANY OF THESE

01:59:45.144 --> 01:59:47.146
BUSINESSES ARE GONNA GO AWAY OR

01:59:47.213 --> 01:59:48.381
BE IMPACTED.

01:59:48.447 --> 01:59:49.916
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO CHANGE

01:59:49.982 --> 01:59:51.050
THEIR MODEL.

01:59:51.117 --> 01:59:53.586
THAT'S WHAT WE DO WE EVOLVE AND

01:59:53.653 --> 01:59:56.322
WE IMPROVE.

01:59:56.389 --> 01:59:57.690
WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT.

01:59:57.757 --> 01:59:59.091
CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:59:59.158 --> 02:00:00.893
AND SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES HERE

02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:02.161
WORK ON THOSE ISSUES.

02:00:02.228 --> 02:00:04.830
WE EVOLVE AND WE CHANGE AND WE

02:00:04.897 --> 02:00:06.499
IMPROVE OUR STANDARDS.

02:00:06.566 --> 02:00:07.533
SO.

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:09.502
WHEN I SEE THESE NUMBERS AND

02:00:09.569 --> 02:00:12.405
WHEN I SEE THE NUMBERS AT THE U.

02:00:12.471 --> 02:00:13.639
S. LEVEL?

02:00:13.706 --> 02:00:16.175
BASIC MATH AGAIN 300-27 MILLION

02:00:16.242 --> 02:00:18.978
US POPULATION NINETY THREE

02:00:19.045 --> 02:00:21.280
MILLION ARE IMPACTED BY DIABETES.

02:00:21.347 --> 02:00:24.817
THAT'S 28% OF OUR POPULATION.

02:00:24.884 --> 02:00:27.386
AND IT'S HIGHER IN CALIFORNIA.

02:00:27.453 --> 02:00:29.956
I MEAN IF WE THINK WE HAVE COSTS

02:00:30.022 --> 02:00:32.258
RIGHT NOW BETWEEN ALL OF THESE

02:00:32.325 --> 02:00:34.260
ISSUES.

02:00:34.327 --> 02:00:36.462
GOING FORWARD NEXT TWENTY YEARS

02:00:36.529 --> 02:00:38.197
IF WE DON'T TRY TO ADDRESS THEM

02:00:38.264 --> 02:00:38.898
RIGHT NOW.

02:00:38.965 --> 02:00:41.667
AND OUR AGING POPULATION AND AS

02:00:41.734 --> 02:00:44.637
WE AGE WE HAVE MORE NEUROLOGICAL

02:00:44.704 --> 02:00:45.972
ISSUES THAT CURRENTLY.

02:00:46.038 --> 02:00:47.940
ELDER POPULATION IS NOT GETTING

02:00:48.007 --> 02:00:50.543
TO AN AGE TO DIE FROM BUT WILL

02:00:50.610 --> 02:00:52.678
BE DYING FROM SOON ENOUGH.

02:00:52.745 --> 02:00:53.913
WITH ALL OF THESE IMPACT.

02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:56.182
HOW ARE WE EVEN GONNA BE ABLE TO

02:00:56.248 --> 02:00:57.617
MAINTAIN?

02:00:57.683 --> 02:00:59.018
THE HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE OF OUR

02:00:59.085 --> 02:01:01.253
STATE AND THIS IS JUST ONE OF

02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:03.589
THE VERY BASIC WAYS.

02:01:03.656 --> 02:01:05.291
THAT WE CAN HELP CURB STARTING

02:01:05.358 --> 02:01:07.293
TODAY SO THAT IN TWENTY YEARS

02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:09.462
TIME WE SEE THE IMPROVEMENTS

02:01:09.528 --> 02:01:11.163
JUST LIKE HOW THE FAST FOOD

02:01:11.230 --> 02:01:11.731
INDUSTRY.

02:01:11.797 --> 02:01:13.232
DID THOSE CHANGES WERE MADE

02:01:13.299 --> 02:01:15.401
ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO ROUGHLY

02:01:15.468 --> 02:01:16.535
TEN YEARS AGO.

02:01:16.602 --> 02:01:19.772
AND WE'RE WE'VE ALREADY SEEN

02:01:19.839 --> 02:01:21.173
DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT.

02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:24.510
SO I THINK THIS IS.

02:01:24.577 --> 02:01:26.712
I THINK THIS IS A GREAT BILL --

02:01:26.779 --> 02:01:29.482
AND A I SUPPORTED AND I DO HOPE

02:01:29.548 --> 02:01:31.550
THAT MY COLLEAGUES SUPPORT THIS

02:01:31.617 --> 02:01:34.020
AS A INCREMENTAL STEP.

02:01:34.086 --> 02:01:35.721
TOWARDS IMPROVING HEALTH CARE

02:01:35.788 --> 02:01:37.223
OUTCOMES.

02:01:37.289 --> 02:01:39.258
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

02:01:39.325 --> 02:01:40.226
SHERMAN MAY I THOUGHT IT WAS A

02:01:40.292 --> 02:01:41.827
QUESTION TO AT ONE POINT IN THAT

02:01:41.894 --> 02:01:42.461
I THOUGHT THERE WAS A QUESTION

02:01:42.528 --> 02:01:44.530
TO THE OPPOSITION WHO MAY OR MAY

02:01:44.597 --> 02:01:45.898
NOT HAVE WORKED ON THEM MENU

02:01:45.965 --> 02:01:47.299
LABELLING RESTAURANTS I WOULD BE

02:01:47.366 --> 02:01:50.803
HAPPY TO RESPOND TO THAT.

02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:51.404
MISTER MISTER WHICH THERE WAS

02:01:51.470 --> 02:01:55.207
RUSSIAN -- ACTUALLY VERY

02:01:55.274 --> 02:01:56.642
FAMILIAR WITH THAT AT FOR AND I

02:01:56.709 --> 02:01:59.311
THINK THE KEY POINT -- MISSION

02:01:59.378 --> 02:02:00.246
IS ARIAN AS THE INFORMATION THAT

02:02:00.312 --> 02:02:01.647
WAS BEING REQUIRED OF

02:02:01.714 --> 02:02:02.948
RESTAURANTS IS EXACTLY THE

02:02:03.015 --> 02:02:03.849
INFORMATION THAT'S ON A

02:02:03.916 --> 02:02:06.118
CONTAINER TODAY.

02:02:06.185 --> 02:02:07.386
IT WAS A FULL MENU A FULL

02:02:07.453 --> 02:02:09.321
CALORIC IMPACT THE FULL YOU KNOW

02:02:09.388 --> 02:02:10.356
WHAT IS IN THE MAKE UP OF THE

02:02:10.423 --> 02:02:12.124
PRODUCT PACKAGE PRODUCTS HAVE

02:02:12.191 --> 02:02:13.159
ALWAYS HAD THAT KNOWS THE

02:02:13.225 --> 02:02:14.093
ARGUMENT IS THEY SHOULD HAVE THE

02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:17.196
SAME -- INFORMATION IS PACKAGED

02:02:17.263 --> 02:02:18.764
FOOD DOES SO.

02:02:18.831 --> 02:02:20.099
I'M NOT ARGUING AGAINST THAT IT

02:02:20.166 --> 02:02:22.068
BROUGHT THE IT BROUGHT THE FAST

02:02:22.134 --> 02:02:23.703
FOOD AND ALL FOOD INDUSTRY ALL

02:02:23.769 --> 02:02:25.004
RESTAURANTS UP TO THE SAME LEVEL

02:02:25.071 --> 02:02:26.605
AS WHAT THAT CONTAINER NOW HOLES

02:02:26.672 --> 02:02:28.107
THERE WAS NOT A WARNING LABEL.

02:02:28.174 --> 02:02:30.176
ABOUT ANY OF THE ELEMENTS BEING

02:02:30.242 --> 02:02:31.177
CONSUMED IT THAT FAST FOOD

02:02:31.243 --> 02:02:35.081
RESTAURANT IT WAS THE SAME

02:02:35.147 --> 02:02:38.084
INFORMATION IT'S ON THE PACKAGE.

02:02:38.150 --> 02:02:39.985
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I DON'T

02:02:40.052 --> 02:02:40.586
WANT TO GO BACK AND FORTH TOO

02:02:40.653 --> 02:02:40.786
MUCH.

02:02:40.853 --> 02:02:43.355
I THINK IF THAT WAS THE CASE WE

02:02:43.422 --> 02:02:46.459
WOULD HAVE ALSO SEEN -- LESS

02:02:46.525 --> 02:02:48.494
IMPACTS HAPPENING.

02:02:48.561 --> 02:02:50.463
OVER THE OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS

02:02:50.529 --> 02:02:51.764
I I DON'T THINK THAT'S

02:02:51.831 --> 02:02:53.399
NECESSARILY THE CASE I THINK.

02:02:53.466 --> 02:02:54.834
THE MORE INFORMATION WE PROVIDE

02:02:54.900 --> 02:02:57.169
THE MORE TRANSPARENCY WE PROVIDE

02:02:57.236 --> 02:02:58.804
THE MORE LABELING WE PROVIDE.

02:02:58.871 --> 02:03:00.506
A FACT THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT

02:03:00.573 --> 02:03:02.575
HOW -- DIET COKE WON'T BE

02:03:02.641 --> 02:03:04.477
IMPACTED BY THIS WELL THERE'S

02:03:04.543 --> 02:03:06.479
QUITE A BIT OF LABELING THAT

02:03:06.545 --> 02:03:08.247
TALKS ABOUT THE SUGAR YOU THE

02:03:08.314 --> 02:03:10.783
SWEETENER USED IN DIET COKE CAN

02:03:10.850 --> 02:03:12.451
CAUSE OTHER HARMS.

02:03:12.518 --> 02:03:14.220
AND SO IT MAKES PEOPLE A LOT

02:03:14.286 --> 02:03:15.921
MORE CONSCIENTIOUS ABOUT WHETHER

02:03:15.988 --> 02:03:18.124
THEY WANT.

02:03:18.190 --> 02:03:18.891
TO YOU.

02:03:18.958 --> 02:03:21.560
DO YOU YOU REALIZE IT OR NOT SO --

02:03:21.627 --> 02:03:23.329
I THINK THE MORE INFORMATION IS

02:03:23.395 --> 02:03:26.065
PROVIDED THE BETTER IT IS AND

02:03:26.132 --> 02:03:28.200
AND I THINK WE CAN ONLY STAND TO

02:03:28.267 --> 02:03:29.001
IN PROOF.

02:03:29.068 --> 02:03:30.569
BOTH ARE HEALTHCARE OUTCOMES AS

02:03:30.636 --> 02:03:33.572
WELL AS INVIGORATING.

02:03:33.639 --> 02:03:39.211
AND REINVIGORATING ARE OUR OUR

02:03:39.278 --> 02:03:42.081
PRODUCERS TO OF OF PROVIDE

02:03:42.148 --> 02:03:43.949
BETTER UP HEALTHIER ALTERNATIVES

02:03:44.016 --> 02:03:46.485
RATHER THAN CONTINUING DOWN THE

02:03:46.552 --> 02:03:48.954
SAME LINE AND SAYING THIRD

02:03:49.021 --> 02:03:50.422
DOESN'T NEED TO BE ANY CHANGE.

02:03:50.489 --> 02:03:53.592
WE CONSTANTLY CHANGE AND IMPROVE

02:03:53.659 --> 02:03:55.294
AND IT'S NOT GONNA HURT ANY

02:03:55.361 --> 02:03:57.363
BUSINESS MODEL TO CHANGE AND

02:03:57.429 --> 02:03:59.098
IMPROVE THEIR PRODUCT NOW ON IN

02:03:59.165 --> 02:04:00.499
THIS AREA.

02:04:00.566 --> 02:04:03.769
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

02:04:03.836 --> 02:04:04.303
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER

02:04:04.370 --> 02:04:07.006
RODRIGUEZ.

02:04:07.072 --> 02:04:08.207
YEAH I WANNA THANK ALL THREE ON

02:04:08.274 --> 02:04:09.141
FOR FOR BRINGING THIS VERY

02:04:09.208 --> 02:04:11.477
IMPORTANT DISCUSSION FOR TO GET

02:04:11.544 --> 02:04:12.411
ENOUGH SLEEP THIS IS YOUR

02:04:12.478 --> 02:04:14.647
PROBABLY SECOND THIRD TIME

02:04:14.713 --> 02:04:15.848
AROUND OF THINKING ABOUT.

02:04:15.915 --> 02:04:16.749
AND I KNOW WE TALKED -- BRIEFLY

02:04:16.816 --> 02:04:17.983
THE OTHER DAY ABOUT -- THE

02:04:18.050 --> 02:04:19.018
ISSUES WITH SUGAR AND AND THE

02:04:19.084 --> 02:04:21.420
INCREASE OF DIABETES OBESITY I

02:04:21.487 --> 02:04:23.722
GET IT DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME.

02:04:23.789 --> 02:04:24.890
BUT THE PROBLEM WANTS ON HAVE IT

02:04:24.957 --> 02:04:25.925
SEEMS LIKE THIS LAST COUPLE

02:04:25.991 --> 02:04:27.359
YEARS IT SEEMS LIKE.

02:04:27.426 --> 02:04:29.028
OF THE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN

02:04:29.094 --> 02:04:30.095
TALKED.

02:04:30.162 --> 02:04:31.997
ABOUT THE INCREASES OF OF ALL

02:04:32.064 --> 02:04:34.700
THE SAME BECAUSE OF SODAS SUGARY

02:04:34.767 --> 02:04:36.202
SWEETENED BEVERAGES.

02:04:36.268 --> 02:04:37.336
AND IT SEEMS BECAUSE OF THE

02:04:37.403 --> 02:04:39.738
INCREASE IS BECAUSE OF THAT I'M

02:04:39.805 --> 02:04:40.840
GONNA TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT SORE

02:04:40.906 --> 02:04:43.275
ABOUT MYSELF PRIOR TO FROM THE

02:04:43.342 --> 02:04:44.443
LEGISLATURE.

02:04:44.510 --> 02:04:45.344
WORKING IN THE ALBUMS INDUSTRY

02:04:45.411 --> 02:04:46.212
FOR IT'S BEEN OVER THIRTY YEARS

02:04:46.278 --> 02:04:46.612
NOW.

02:04:46.679 --> 02:04:47.847
AND I COULD SEE THIS GOING BACK

02:04:47.913 --> 02:04:49.615
OVER TEN YEARS OUT THERE THAT.

02:04:49.682 --> 02:04:50.883
WE STARTED TO SEE THE INCREASE

02:04:50.950 --> 02:04:52.318
OF OBESITY AND DIABETES BACK

02:04:52.384 --> 02:04:54.653
THEN BUT IT WAS NEVER BECAUSE OF

02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:56.388
SUGAR IT WAS NEVER BECAUSE OUR

02:04:56.455 --> 02:04:57.857
KIDS ARE DRINKING SUGAR IT WAS

02:04:57.923 --> 02:04:59.091
JUST SOMETHING WHAT.

02:04:59.158 --> 02:05:00.526
WHAT WE'RE DOING WHETHER IT'S

02:05:00.593 --> 02:05:02.094
PEOPLE ARE BEING AS HEALTHY AS

02:05:02.161 --> 02:05:03.529
THEY SHOULD BE?

02:05:03.596 --> 02:05:05.297
THE DISCUSSION WAS NEVER ABOUT

02:05:05.364 --> 02:05:11.203
THAT FAST FOR TWO NOW IT SEEMS

02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:14.273
LIKE WE'RE SINGLING OUT.

02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:15.608
ONE OUR LOCAL INDUSTRY OR ONE

02:05:15.674 --> 02:05:17.042
ONE TYPE OF MANUFACTURE WHAT

02:05:17.109 --> 02:05:18.143
WE'RE PRODUCING AS A SOUL

02:05:18.210 --> 02:05:19.645
BECAUSE OF IT AND IT'S NOT THEY

02:05:19.712 --> 02:05:20.412
COULD BE PART OF IT YEAH DON'T

02:05:20.479 --> 02:05:20.746
GET ME WRONG.

02:05:20.813 --> 02:05:22.147
BUT WE LOOK AT THAT'S THE ONLY

02:05:22.214 --> 02:05:24.583
REASON WHY.

02:05:24.650 --> 02:05:25.784
WE SEE THAT BIG INCREASE IT'S

02:05:25.851 --> 02:05:27.186
BEEN HAPPENING FOR YEARS I'VE

02:05:27.253 --> 02:05:28.821
WORKED IN THE FIELD I'VE TAKEN

02:05:28.888 --> 02:05:30.689
MANY PATIENTS ALSO DOES.

02:05:30.756 --> 02:05:32.324
AND I'VE SEEN IT.

02:05:32.391 --> 02:05:33.525
OVER TEN YEARS FIFTEEN YEARS AGO

02:05:33.592 --> 02:05:35.194
PART OF COMING UP HERE.

02:05:35.261 --> 02:05:37.096
SO LATELY WHEN I HEAR THAT

02:05:37.162 --> 02:05:37.830
DISCUSSION MAKES ME.

02:05:37.897 --> 02:05:39.298
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WERE BEING

02:05:39.365 --> 02:05:40.699
HEARD ABOUT.

02:05:40.766 --> 02:05:41.934
ON ANOTHER ISSUE ON THE TALK

02:05:42.001 --> 02:05:43.335
ABOUT MY DAUGHTER I DON'T WANT

02:05:43.402 --> 02:05:44.270
TO SPECIFICALLY NAME THE PLACE

02:05:44.336 --> 02:05:45.504
WHERE SHE WORKS.

02:05:45.571 --> 02:05:47.973
BUT SHE WORKS AT A PLACE WHERE

02:05:48.040 --> 02:05:49.742
THEY SELL -- COFFEE.

02:05:49.808 --> 02:05:51.043
AND I WAS RECENTLY THERE

02:05:51.110 --> 02:05:53.045
WATCHING OR SHOES AT WORK

02:05:53.112 --> 02:05:53.846
BECAUSE SHE WOULD TELL ME.

02:05:53.913 --> 02:05:55.381
THAT YOU KNOW WHAT SOME OF THESE

02:05:55.447 --> 02:05:55.915
KIDS ARE COMING WITH THEIR

02:05:55.981 --> 02:05:57.549
FAMILIES.

02:05:57.616 --> 02:06:00.386
AND THEY'LL GET A DRINK IN THE

02:06:00.452 --> 02:06:04.256
AD PUMPS OF SIR SHE WAS YOU KNOW

02:06:04.323 --> 02:06:07.159
HOW MUCH A POMPOUS YOUR PALS.

02:06:07.226 --> 02:06:08.027
AND THE FAMILIES IN THE MOTHERS

02:06:08.093 --> 02:06:10.462
ARE WITH THEM AND THEY'LL TAKE

02:06:10.529 --> 02:06:11.096
FIVE TO TEN POUNDS AND I'VE SEEN

02:06:11.163 --> 02:06:12.698
THEM.

02:06:12.765 --> 02:06:13.299
KIDS OF ALL COLORS AND RACES.

02:06:13.365 --> 02:06:15.334
AND I'M LIKE WOW BUT YET WE

02:06:15.401 --> 02:06:16.302
DON'T LOOK AT THAT AS AN ISSUE.

02:06:16.368 --> 02:06:18.737
BUT WE LOOK MORE ABOUT A SUGARY

02:06:18.804 --> 02:06:22.508
BEVERAGE -- I'M HAVING

02:06:22.574 --> 02:06:23.108
DIFFICULTIES WITH THIS BILL.

02:06:23.175 --> 02:06:23.742
I THINK THAT'S PART OF IT BUT I

02:06:23.809 --> 02:06:24.910
THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT

02:06:24.977 --> 02:06:26.979
NEEDS TO BE DONE ON HOW WE BRING

02:06:27.046 --> 02:06:27.513
OUR YOUTH.

02:06:27.579 --> 02:06:28.747
THE STARTS AT HOME WITH OUR

02:06:28.814 --> 02:06:30.849
PARENTS OUR FAMILIES OR MOTHERS

02:06:30.916 --> 02:06:32.918
FATHERS OF FAMILY MEMBERS AND

AND I LOOK AT LABELS AS A WAY TO

02:09:54.820 --> 02:09:56.455
EDUCATE PEOPLE.

02:09:56.522 --> 02:09:58.390

02:10:15.707 --> 02:10:16.341
SO.

02:10:16.408 --> 02:10:17.910
SOME FOOD MANUFACTURERS OF HAVE

02:10:17.976 --> 02:10:20.812
FIGURED OUT A WAY TO USE THE

02:10:20.879 --> 02:10:22.481
LABELS AS MARKETING. TO ATTRACT

02:10:22.548 --> 02:10:25.684

A DIFFERENT WAY -- AND YEAH

02:10:29.655 --> 02:10:31.356
MAYBE THE INDUSTRY COULD BE

02:10:31.423 --> 02:10:32.491
CHALLENGED TO DO THAT.

02:10:32.558 --> 02:10:34.426
PUT IT OUT THERE YOU DON'T LET

02:10:34.493 --> 02:10:36.195
PEOPLE KNOW BECAUSE THEY ARE

02:10:36.261 --> 02:10:37.563

GO TO CONVENIENCE STORES I GO TO

02:10:39.398 --> 02:10:41.200
GAS STATIONS AND THEY'RE GONNA

CONSUME THINGS IT'S SUMMERTIME

02:10:41.867 --> 02:10:42.234
IT.

02:10:42.301 --> 02:10:43.769
IT'S A HUNDRED DEGREES OUTSIDE

02:10:43.835 --> 02:10:45.938

CHOOSE TO DO SOMETHING ELSE.

02:10:52.377 --> 02:10:53.679
AND I WAS IN MEXICO A COUPLE

02:10:53.745 --> 02:10:55.547

CIGARETTES.

02:10:59.551 --> 02:11:00.652
SCARE THE HECK OUT OF A PERSON

02:11:00.719 --> 02:11:01.853
WHEN YOU SEE WHAT'S ON THOSE

WE HAVE A U. S. SURGE SURGEON

DEATH -- WE'RE EDUCATING PEOPLE

02:11:14.566 --> 02:11:16.001
AND THAT'S HOW I LOOK THAT'S HOW

02:11:16.068 --> 02:11:18.370
I LOOK AT LABELS SO -- I THINK

02:11:18.437 --> 02:11:21.607

02:11:25.777 --> 02:11:26.578
AWARENESS.

02:11:26.645 --> 02:11:28.313
IT WAS PEOPLE THINK ABOUT WHAT
