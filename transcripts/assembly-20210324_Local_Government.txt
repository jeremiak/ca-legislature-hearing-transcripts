AB FOUR EIGHTY BY THIS MEMBER CHIU PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON COLLEAGUES MANAGER APPRECIATE YOU AND YOUR STAFF CONSIDERATION AND DELIBERATION OVER AB FORTY ONE. OUR BILL WILL INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY BETWEEN POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. AS A FORMER CRIMINAL PROSECUTOR I KNOW AND BELIEVE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IN CALIFORNIA OUR FOUR PARTNERS AND PUBLIC SAFETY. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT MILITARY GENERALS AND THAT THERE SHOULD BE POLICIES THAT GOVERN THE WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT THAT THEY CARRY TO REFLECT THAT REALITY. CALIFORNIA'S LED THE NATION AND HAVING PROCURED THE MOST MILITARY WEAPONRY OF ANY STATE. LAST SUMMER. OUR STATE SAW AN ALARMING RANGE OF EQUIPMENT AND ACTION WHEN POLICE SPRAY TEAR GAS FOR MILITARY GRENADE LAUNCHERS AT PEACEFUL PROTESTERS. AND SHOT RUBBER BULLETS AT UNARMED CITIZENS FROM BEHIND ARMORED VEHICLES- BEEN A NUMBER OF STUDIES THAT HAVE SHOWN. THAT MORE MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS INCREASED THE RATE OF VIOLENT INCIDENTS INCLUDING POLICE SHOOTINGS THAT OCCUR IN THESE JURISDICTIONS. THE DECISIONS OF HOW AND WHEN TO DEPLOY THE SENSITIVE EQUIPMENT WAS LEFT UP TO INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS AT THE SCENE THIS PAST YEAR. WITHOUT UNIFORM PROTOCOL OR TRAINING. WE KNOW THAT THIS WOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE IN WAR ZONES LIKE IRAQ OR AFGHANISTAN. WHERE THIS EQUIPMENT WAS DESIGNED TO BE USED. AB FORTY ONE WOULD ALLOW LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. AGENCIES TO WORK WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES AND GOVERNING BOARDS TO DROP APPROPRIATE MILITARY EQUIPMENT USE AND IMPACT POLICIES THAT CAN BE DELIBERATED AND APPROVED IN A PUBLIC SETTING. THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW WHEN AND WHY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT BELIEVETHAT THEY NEED TO USE MILITARY CALIBER COMMITMENT ESPECIALLY WHEN OUR POLICE ARE USING PUBLIC DOLLARS TO PURCHASE AND MAINTAIN ADEQUATE. WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO TURN OVER TOLD WITNESSES. GO AHEAD WE HAVE. FIRST WITH THIS. HI CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN. WONDERFUL GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO PROVIDING YOU HERE TODAY.

CALIFORNIA POLICE HAVE ACQUIRED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS OF SURPLUS MILITARY EQUIPMENT. INCLUDING MINE RESISTANT AMBUSH PROTECTED VEHICLES UNMANNED GROUND VEHICLES ASSAULT RIFLES AND NIGHT VISION SNIPER SCOPES. OTHER FEDERAL PROGRAMS DON'T REQUIRE ANY REPORTING BUT A CATALOG WITH EVERYTHING FROM ARMORED VEHICLES TONIGHT VISION GOGGLES. WHO IS THE ENEMY ARE TRYING TO COMBAT. THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FOUND NO TRACE POLICE FORCES MOST OFTEN HE IN BLACKIE. EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING CRIME RIGHT AND SEVERAL STUDIES FOUND THAT CORRELATION BETWEEN INCREASED POLICE MILITARY. AND INCREASED POLICE CAN. FOR ALL THIS HARM THERE IS NO BENEFIT. RATIO MILITARY. FAILED TO CRIME SALES TO A HANDS OFF SAFETY. AND FAILED SUPPORT HOW TRUST IN MY FOURTH. EIGHTY FOUR EIGHT ONE PRESENT AND EASY FIX. POLICE AGENCIES INCLUDING THOSE THAT CONTACT WITH OR ARE HOUSED WITHIN SCHOOL DISTRICTS ALREADY REPORT INFORMATION ABOUT PLANNED PURCHASES DURING THE ANNUAL BUDGET REVIEW PROCESS. THIS BILL SIMPLY REQUIRED ADDITIONAL DETAIL ABOUT THE EQUIPMENT SHOT AS WELL AS THE USAGE POLICY BEFORE POLICE CAN BRING THE MOST EXTREME WARLIKE EQUIPMENT INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. THIS IS A MINIMAL ASK OF OUR PUBLIC SERVANTS. POLICE MAY CLAIM THEY NEED THIS EQUIPMENT WE ARE JUST SAYING THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC SHOULD HAVE A VOICE IN THE PROCESS. AB FOUR EIGHT ONE IT IS A COMMON SENSE SOLUTION TO ADVANCE RACIAL JUSTICE REDUCE POLICE VIOLENCE AND IN CERTAIN BASIC TRANSPARENCY MEASURES. ALL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES INCLUDING THOSE HEADED BY ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT. THIS BASIC PRINCIPLE OF GOVERNMENT MUST WE MUST BE IMPLEMENTED WITH REGARD TO EQUIPMENT.

IN SELECTING THE CONSTRUCTION CRAP- CONTRACTOR FOR A MAJOR MAJOR SEISMIC RETROFIT PROJECT ANDERSON DAMAGE THE SILICON VALLEY'S LARGEST AND MOST CRITICAL LOCAL WATER STORAGE FACILITY. AND THIS LEGISLATION IS NECESSARY IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE UNDER CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW VALLEY WATER MUST. SELECT A CONTRACTOR THROUGH THE MOST COMMON PROCUREMENT PROCEDURE USE WHICH IS A LOW BID PROCUREMENT SYSTEM. RATHER THAN BY BEST VALUE AND AS WE KNOW THE BEST VALUE. PROCUREMENT SYSTEM. HEY IS- IT CONSIDERS FACTORS OTHER THAN ONLY PRICE- SUCH AS THE QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERTISE OF VENDORS OR CONTRACTORS. IN INDEPENDENT BOARD OF CONSULTANTS CONSISTING OF SOME OF THE NATION'S FOREMOST DAM SAFETY EXPERTS. HAVE RECOMMENDED THE USE OF A BEST VALUE PROCUREMENT SYSTEM AND SELECTED A CONTRACTOR FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT AND UNDERSTAND DUE TO ITS COMPLEX DESIGN ITS DELIVERY AND INSTALLATION. I IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT OTHER MAJOR SERVICES STORAGE PROJECTS IN OUR STATE VERY SIMILAR TO THIS ONE. ARE ALREADY AUTHORIZED FOR BEST VALUE PROCUREMENT OF CONTRACTOR SELECTION. THIS IS A MAJOR MAJOR PROJECT FOR OUR REGION ACCORDING TO A DAM SAFETY DIRECTIVE ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION JUST LAST YEAR. THEY STATED THAT THE SAFETY RISK AT THIS PARTICULAR DAM ANDERSON DAM IS UNACCEPTABLY HIGH. AUTHORIZING THE USE FOR BEST VALUE PROCUREMENT WILL ALLOW THE SAFEST AND BEST OVERALL VALUE FOR THE REMOVAL AND- AN EXPERT REPLACEMENT OF THIS CRITICAL WATER STORAGE PROJECT. SO I JUST LISTEN ALSO ENSURES THEY SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE WILL BE EMPLOYED AS PROJECT.

RIVERSIDE VOEPEL RIGHT NOW HI EIGHT ZERO EIGHT ZERO YOUR BILLS OUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS. LET'S MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER FIVE AB THREE FORTY FIVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORK SILVA WELCOME MISS KIRK SILVA. GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON IT IS CHILLY IN HERE JUST TRYING TO KEEP EVERYBODY AWAKE HUH. ALL RIGHT WELL GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE TO PRESENT AB THREE FORTY FIVE MY ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT BILL OR A DO YOU BILL ALL OUR GRANNY FLAT BILL FOR THOSE WHO USED TO CALL OF THAT. AB THREE FORTY FIVE WOULD MAKE A MODEST CHANGES TO A CURRENT LAW BY REMOVING EXISTING BARRIERS FOR NONPROFIT OF NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE OWNERSHIP. DEVELOPERS BUILDING HOMES FOR VERY LOW AND EXTREMELY LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. NOW LET ME BE CLEAR. FIRST IT IS A CHOICE FOR A PROPERTY OWNER TO BUILD A DAY DO YOU. SECOND IT'S ANOTHER CHOICE TO CONVEY OR TRANSFER THAT EIGHTY YOU TO A NON PROFIT. THIS MEASURE WOULD ALLOW THE SEPARATE SALE OF AN EIGHTY YOU IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES AS THE DEFAULT IN CALIFORNIA RATHER THAN REQUIRING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THE FIRST PASSED ORDINANCES WHICH CAN BE AS WE ALL KNOW VERY LENGTHY AND DRAWN OUT PROCESSES. BY REMOVING THIS REQUIREMENT AND ADDING LANGUAGE CLARIFYING THE TENANT IN COMMON AGREEMENT THIS MEASURE WILL ALLOW NONPROFITS LIKE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY TO EXPAND THE REACH OFFERING ADDITIONAL OWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES. AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE HABITAT HUMANITY AS I'VE WORKED DIRECTLY WITH THEM AND FOR MANY OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T WORKED WITH THEM THEY REALLY LITERALLY GIVE THE KEYS TO HOMEOWNERS UP WITH A PARTNERSHIP PROJECTS. AS WE KNOW ALL TOO WELL BEFORE THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC OUR STATE WAS FACING ONE OF THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS IS. AND CONTINUES TO NOTHING HAS CHANGED SINCE THE PANDEMIC ONLY THAT THE OUTCOMES ARE EVEN WORSE WE KNOW THAT MANY FAMILIES ARE AT THE RISK OF LOSING HOMES BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC BUT EVEN THOSE FAMILIES BEFORE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OWN A HOME IS VERY ELUSIVE FOR SO MANY CALIFORNIANS. WITH THAT ONE OF THE REASONS IS SIMPLY HOUSING PRODUCTION. WE KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY ATTEMPTS TO BRING HOUSING PRODUCTION BILLS TO OUR STATE AND MANY HAVE BEEN BLOCKED OR STOPPED. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR THE INCREASE COST. MY DAUGHTER HERSELF JUST PURCHASED A HOUSE. IN FULLER TEN FOR ALL OVER THE MEDIUM PRICE BECAUSE OF BIDDING WARS A NINETEEN TWENTIES VERY SMALL WITH ALMOST NO YARD HOME. AT A VERY HIGH PRICE BECAUSE THERE'S NOT VERY MANY HOMES AVAILABLE. WITH THAT. I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL ADD TO OUR STOCK OF HOUSING IT WILL ADD FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS PROPERTY OWNERS THAT CHOOSE AN OPTION FOR SOMEBODY TO LIVE ON THEIR PROPERTY AND FOR THEM TO CONVEY THAT TO NONPROFIT AFTER CHOICE WITH ME TODAY I HAVE. TWO WITNESSES. AND THE HERE TO SHARE INFORMATION IS DEBBIE. RKL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY. MODERATOR WE WILL TAKE THE BOTH THE WITNESSES DEBBIE AND SUSAN MAN THAT. YES YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS DEBBIE OUR ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WITH HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIA AND I'M REPRESENTING THE VIEWS OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY AFFILIATES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR AB THREE FORTY FIVE AND STAND ALONGSIDE ASSEMBLYMEMBER SHARON QUIRK SILVA INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE OWNER OCCUPIED UNITS. AND MANY OF YOU KNOW HABITAT IS AN AFFORDABLE HOME DEVELOPER AND LENDER FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND HOUSEHOLDS WE SERVE OUR LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES AND OVER TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP THROUGH HABITAT. pHOMEOWNERS ARE HOUSEHOLDS OF COLOR AND OVER 15% INCLUDE AT THAT CAN FAMILY MEMBER I REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS LEGISLATION DOES NOT CHANGE THE EXISTING HOME DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL PROCESS. HABITAT AND ANY OTHER NONPROFIT BUILDERS WOULD STILL NEED TO FOLLOW THE SAME THE MIDDLE PROCESS WITH AN APPLICATION THE REVIEW AND THE APPROVAL REQUIRED BY LOCAL PLANNING AND BUILDING DEPARTMENT WHAT THE LEGISLATION REALLY DOES IS IT SERVES TO REMOVE THE EXTRA BURDEN OF REQUIRING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ADOPT A SEPARATE ORDINANCE WHICH IS A DETERRENT FOR DEVELOPERS WE HAVE HABITAT AFFILIATE TO INQUIRED ABOUT. BUILDING MORE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS FOR LOW INCOME OWNERSHIP AND BEING ABLE TO EXPAND OF LAND USE WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE ASPECTS OF ANY DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE EXTRA TIME AND EFFORT THAT IT WOULD TAKE TO WORK WITH CITIES TO ADOPT BEFORE EVEN STARTING. A PROJECT APPROVAL PROCESS. INCREASE AFFORDABLE PRODUCTION ESSENTIAL FOR CAL. REMOVING BARRIERS LOST MAINTAINING LOCAL APPROVAL PROCESS EASIER WOULD SAVE NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE DEVELOPERS LIKE HABITAT VALUABLE TIME AND MONEY. AND THAT LEGISLATION WOULD ALLOW EIGHTY YOU DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE APPROVED TO BE SOLD FIVE RIGHT RATHER THAN REQUIRING THE EXTRAVAGANCE. BY REMOVING OF THE ORDINANCE MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS WILL BE BUILT AND SOLD TO LOW INCOME BUYERS AND OFTEN FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS OF COLOR THIS WOULD ALLOW. US ALL TO HELP CLOSE THE RACIAL GAP IN HOMEOWNERSHIP. ADDITIONALLY AS MENTIONED THE BILL PROVIDES CLARITY IN THE LAW BY DESCRIBING THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE TENANT IN COMMON AGREEMENT NEEDING AND NEEDED UNDER THIS PROVISION. IT WOULD EASE THE BARRIERS TO DEVELOPMENT AND INCREASE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO YOU- YOU. MAKE BETTER USE LAND AND- THE NUMBER LOW INCOME HOMEOWNER. JUST AS A QUICK SUCCESS STORY TO ILLUSTRATE WE WERE ABLE TO APPLY THAT EIGHTY LEGISLATION IN. BUTTE COUNTY AND THEY WERE ABLE TO ACQUIRE THREE PARCELS THAT THEY WERE GOING TO SERVE THREE HOMEOWNERS AND NAME. AND TO THE LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED THEY WERE ABLE TO TURN THAT INTO SERVING SIX NEW HOMEOWNERS CAN FIVE OF THEM HAD BEEN DISPLACED BY THE CAMP WILD FIRES. IF THIS DEAL LEGISLATION AB THREE FORTY FIVE WITH IN PLACE THEY WOULD HAVE SAVED SIGNIFICANT TIME AND MONEY AND BEEN ABLE TO SERVICE HOMEOWNERS QUICKER. AB EIGHT THREE FORTY FIVE WILL HELP INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOME TO HELP CLOSE THE OWNERSHIP GAP ACROSS RACE AND ETHNICITY AND HELP REDUCE THE COST. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIA IS GRATEFUL FOR THE TREMENDOUS CONSIDERATION OF THIS IMPORTANT DEL AND WE ARE CAN HIDE. THE KEY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANOTHER WAY IN. SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON JERRY MEMBERS DOESN'T MATTER NOT- LIKE HEALTH PUBLIC AFFAIRS REPRESENTING- BIRD AFFINITY COMPLAINING AND URBAN RESEARCH INSTITUTION AS WELL CALIFORNIA YIMBY- WHO ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION BECAUSE THE BEST- THIS LEGISLATION REALLY- BRING- BRING THE MINUTE CURRENT EIGHTY LAW WHICH MANDATES EIGHTY YOU'D BE ALLOWED STATEWIDE- BUT IT IT AND IT STILL ALLOWED LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO PASS CODE NINJAS. ON EIGHTY LEGISLATION- TO PROCEED WITH THAT PROCESS- WE FIND THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION WOULD BE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN'S A LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT INCREASED ALL MONISHA FOR LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR- PRIMARILY AND HISTORICALLY EXCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES THAT AFRICAN GENERATIONAL WEALTH BUILDING OPPORTUNITIES AND ECONOMIC STABILITY TO THOSE THAT HAVE FREQUENTLY BEEN DISENFRANCHISED- FROM OWNERSHIP. SO WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR HER- LEADERSHIP TODAY I'M OFTEN HERE FOR ANY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SHOULD THERE BE QUESTION THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY WITNESS PRIMARY. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. HERE'S NOT- AND THERE'S ANY OF IT OPPOSITION ROOM FORTY TWO OR TWO. SEEING NONE- MODERATOR IF YOU'D LIKE TO OPEN UP THE LINES AGAIN AND THAT WOULD BE FOR OPPOSITION AND FOR- SUPPORT- JUST NAME ORGANIZATION. I'M SORRY I MISSED. JUST NAME OF IF YOU ARE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. HERE IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OF AB THREE FOUR FIVE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN. ZERO ONE AND THEN ZERO FOR SUPPORTER OPPOSITION. AND ONE MOMENT PLEASE WE'LL GET LINE NUMBER. OUR FIRST FINAL COME FROM ONE TO THIRTY SEVEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS LAUREN TABLE AND SEAT REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AGAIN THAT'S ONE AND THEN ZERO FOR OPPOSITION OR SUPPORT. AND WE HAVE ONE MORE LINE IN HERE. ONE MOMENT WHERE WE GATHER THEIR NUMBER. CANNELLA COME FROM NINE TO FORTY FOR YOUR LINE IS OPEN- HI ADAM CHEN TOOK ON BEHALF THE HOUSING ACTION COALITION IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE FOUR FIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION OR SUPPORT IN Q. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH MODERATE OR ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. UGH QUESTION FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAR HARBOR. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FOR THIS LEGISLATION I WAS WONDERING- SINCE THE LAURA FRIEDMAN BILL CREATED THIS WHEN TO AFFECTED JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN WE'VE BEEN IN A PANDEMIC- I'M NOT SURE. THERE'S EVIDENCE OUT THERE THAT SHOWS THAT CITIES ARE PURPOSELY OBSTRUCTING THE ORDINANCE I'VE BEEN I WAS ON THE AND SENATE CITY COUNCIL EIGHTY YEARS ARE HIGHLY- ACCEPTABLE FORM OF HOUSING IN MY CITY BUT I BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY IN THE NEED FOR LOCAL CONTROL AND PASSING AN ORDINANCE. THAT ALLOWS THIS TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT IS NOT ONEROUS OR DIFFICULT AND SO I THINK IT'S PREMATURE TO SAY THAT WE HAVE TO DO BY RIGHT AND WE HAVE TO FORCE ALL CITIES TO DO THIS. BECAUSE IT DOES GET RID OF SINGLE FAMILY ZONING AND IT DOES GIVE A TURN CONVEYANCER NONPROFIT AND THEY'RE GOOD NONPROFITS LIKE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY WHICH I HAVE BUILT HABITAT FOR HUMANITY HOUSES WHEN I WAS A BERKELEY. IT'S A GREAT ORGANIZATION BUT IF IT'S ANY NONPROFIT SO THERE ARE SOME BAD ACTORS OUT THERE SO I THINK IT'S PREMATURE TO SAY WE NEED TO GO STRAIGHT TO THE BY RIGHT THAT IT'S NOT WORKING I THINK THAT THERE'S EVIDENCE AFTER THE PANDEMIC THAT IS NOT WORKING. I THINK THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO BRING BACK THEN BUT TO SAY WE'RE GONNA DO IT BY RIGHT AND WE TAKE FOR AWAY SINGLE FAMILY ZONING AND PLACES WHERE EIGHTY WAS ARE CURRENTLY ACCEPTABLE MAKING IT PERHAPS NOT ACCEPTABLE IN OTHER PLACES- IS NOT THE WAY TO INCREASE. HOUSING STUFF AND I'LL BE OPPOSING THE BILL. THANK YOU DE ASK ME QUESTION AND THE QUESTION WAS HAVE WE SEEN ANY EVIDENCE- RELATED TO. ONEROUS OBJECTIONS TO EIGHTY USE I WOULD FIRSTHAND SAY I'VE NOT SEEN ONEROUS OBJECTIONS BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY AT THE FOR EVEN THE CURRENT PROJECT. PROCESSES WITH THE LEGISLATION THAT WE HAVE PASSED IN LAST HANDFUL OF YEARS. THE LAST TWO YEARS SPECIFICALLY. THEY STILL ARE VERY UNCLEAR ON SOME OF THE LANGUAGE WHICH WE ACTUALLY HAD ADDITIONAL PIECES OF LEGISLATION. BUT DECIDED NOT TO MOVE FORWARD ON THOSE- BY MYSELF HAVE LOOKED INTO NAY D. YOU ON OUR OWN PROPERTY. AND AS MUCH WORK AS WE'VE DONE IN THE STATE THERE STILL ARE CITIES AND IT IS CITY BY CITY I KNOW IN YOUR AREA. THEY ARE MUCH SWIFTER AS YOU ALL EVEN HAVE A SHELF READY PLANS WHICH- WE WOULD LIKE TO GET TO THAT. BUT IT DEPENDS ON THE CITY. BUT AS FAR AS THE BY RIGHT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AUTHORIZING. BUT IT STILL REMAINS WITH THE SELLER IN NO WAY ARE WE SUGGESTING THAT THE CITY COME IN. TO EACH DEVELOPMENT OR SINGLE FAMILY HOME AND SAY YOU HAVE TO BUILD A NAY D. YOU. OR YOU MAY NOT ONLY HAVE TO BUILD A DO YOU. BUT IN ADDITION YOU HAVE TO CONVEY THAT TO. A NON PROFIT SO THIS IS AN EXTRA TOOL IN THE TOOL KIT. AND THE MAIN REASON THAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON DOING THIS IS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THOSE THAT CHOOSE TO BE ABLE TO. REDUCE THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT IT'S TAKING TO BE READY TO I MEAN WE CAN'T HAVE EACH CITY AS WAS NOTED- LOOK AT THE END OF. AND VOTE ON AN ORDINANCE OR NOT. AND WE KNOW THAT THOSE CAN TAKE YEARS AND SOMETIMES A NEVER HAD. SERIOUSLY IF THEY CANNOT BUT- EACH CITY IS DIFFERENT BUT THAT THAT'S OUR FOCUS ON THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- I- WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT- AND I APPRECIATE THE INTERCHANGE BETWEEN TWO IN MY COLLEAGUES I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- THE- THAT. THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY DOING BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS IS A BILL THAT AFFECTS SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE ZONING. BOB WHAT IT DOES ALL THAT THAT THAT WE HAVE A THIS IS A VERY CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC BECAUSE WE HAVE OTHER. LEGISLATION PENDING IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT ALLOWS FOR. LOT SPLITS AND DUPLEXES TO BE BUILT AND A DUPLEX IS NOT A SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE WHAT THIS DOES IS IT ALLOWS. A LOT SPLIT. AND FOR THERE TO BE TO SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCES. WHICH TO MY MIND IS VERY DIFFERENT- AND IS VERY COMPATIBLE WITH THE- EXISTING NEIGHBORHOODS THAT THE LOTS WOULD BE SMALLER AND IT INCREASES THE DENSITY OF A- VERY. MARGINAL WAY I DON'T SEE THIS. TAKING OVER ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOODS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IS NOT INTENDED TO DO THAT IT'S INTENDED TO PROVIDE- NONPROFITS THAT- SERVE LOW INCOME CONSTITUENCIES. AND AN OPTION FOR CREATING SOME ADDITIONAL AFFORDABILITY AND CURRENTLY ON AFFORDABLE NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH IS MOST NEIGHBORHOODS- UNFORTUNATELY- BUT I DO WANT TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER- AND STRUCTURALLY HOW THIS WORKS IS THE- IS THE INTENT. HERE THAT. NONPROFITS WILL PURCHASE AN ENTIRE PROPERTY AND- AND THEN DO A LOT SPLIT- OR IS THE INTENT FOR THE NONPROFIT TO WORK WITH AN EXISTING HOMEOWNER TO DO A LOT SPLIT AND THEN. THE LATTER THE LETTER AS FAR AS WORKING WITH EXISTING HOMEOWNER SITE GO AHEAD SO MY QUESTION IS IN THAT SITUATION- HOW IS THE VALUE OF THE- EIGHTY YOU PART OF A OF THE LOT- HOW IS THAT VALUE DETERMINED BECAUSE IF IT'S BEING- IF IT'S BECOMING. A GOT LOW INCOME HOUSING. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE OWNER OF- WHO'S SELLING OFF THE- THAT THE SPLIT PART OF A LOT IS NOT GOING TO RECEIVE FAIR MARKET I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DETERMINE FOR MARKET VALUE I GUESS. I THINK THAT. HOME OWNERS DON'T GET SHORT CHANGED IN THE PROCESS. RIGHT AND I THINK IT IS THE CHOICE OF THE OWNER AND THE SENSE THAT THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEY IN ESSENCE ARE- WORKING WITH HABITAT WHICH FOCUSES ON- INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE. IN THE- LOW TO VERY LOW. INCOME BRACKET ã BRACKET AND SO THIS WOULD BE AN COULD SEEN BE SEEN AS A WAY TO HELP SAYS A SUBSIDIZED. THIS PROPERTY SO THAT SOMEBODY COULD GET INTO A PIECE OF PROPERTY. THAT WOULDN'T TYPICALLY BE ABLE TO- THE HABITAT PROPERTIES. THAT ARE NOT INVOLVED WITH THEY DO USE AS YOU KNOW IN MANY CITIES. IT'S USUALLY THE CITY AS A PARTNER- THAT IS WORKING TOGETHER WITH HABITAT AND MANY pACTUALLY GIVEN AND THAT ALLOWS THIS PARTNERSHIP TO TAKE PLACE- BUT AS FAR AS THE TECHNICAL DETAILS I DON'T HAVE THOSE WITH ME. AND FRENEMY BUT THE ENTIRE IDEA IS THAT YOU HAVE A LOT. YOU'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH HABITAT. TO GET IN. EXTREMELY LOW TO LOW INCOME PERSON TO TAKE THAT PROPERTY. AND TO CONVEY IT THROUGH THE NONPROFIT SO I'M SUFFICIENTLY SATISFIED TO OF THAT THE BILL'S GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION OF VOTE FOR TODAY AND YOUR SPONSORS ARE LISTENING AND KNOW HOW TO REACH ME AND I. JUST ASKED THEM TO- SET UP A MEETING WITH ME SO I CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND AND- PERHAPS EVEN HELP ACROSS SOME OF THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL. THANK YOUNG ONE WHO'S BEEN INTENSELY. INTERESTED IN EIGHTY YEARS FROM. WELL KNOW YOU YOU HAVE BEEN THE IN EIGHTY USE THAT- WELL THAT'S HOW I GOT INVOLVED. AFTER I. EXACTLY ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MANY MEMBERS OKAY ALL RIGHT THE VICE WHEN HE ENTERTAINMENT OKAY WE HAVE MOTION BY A PHONE NUMBER RAMOS OF A SECOND BY ROB ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROBERT RIVAS. LET'S SEE HERE- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I JUST WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. BY ALLOWING QUALIFIED NONPROFITS TO CONVEY TO YOU SEPARATELY FROM THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE YOUR BILL WILL HELP INCREASE HOME. OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES YOU HAVE FOUND A WAY TO INCREASE HOMEOWNERSHIP WITHOUT ALTERING OR INFRINGING ON THE LOCAL DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL PROCESS OR REQUIRING NEW SOURCES OF STATE FUNDING THAT IS QUITE A FEAT.
