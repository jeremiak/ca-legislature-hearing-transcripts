ON BUDGET WE WILL BE HEARING -- THIS IS A JOINT INFORMATIONAL COMMITTEE WITH ASSEMBLY LOCAL GOLF. IS OUR ASSEMBLY LOCAL GOV CHAIR HERE FINANCE TO COME ON UP WILL BE TALKING ABOUT SB. ONE NO TWO OUR HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS TRAILER BILL. AGAIN THIS BILL BUILT ON THE SUCCESS OF LAST YEAR'S HEAP PROGRAM BY ESTABLISHING THE HOMELESS. HOUSING ASSISTANCE A PREVENTION PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES JURISDICTIONS THE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TO ADDRESS THE MEDIA HOMELESS CHALLENGES. AS WELL AS PROVIDE STREAMLINING FOR LOW BARRIER NAVIGATIONS ARE DEVELOPMENTS. THAT ALSO CREATES LOCAL GOVERNMENT TRYING TO SUPPORT GRANT PROGRAMS TO ALLOCATE. TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FOR REGION'S JURISDICTIONS TO CONDUCT PLAN THE ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE SIX CYCLE OF REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT SO WITH THAT -- DEPARTMENT FINANCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I'LL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE AT THREE MAJOR ELEMENTS IN THIS BILL IN THAT HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS WITH MY COLLEAGUE DANIEL WHO'S ALSO HERE. THE FIRST IS THE ELEMENTS RELATED TO NEW HOUSING FUNDING -- MOST OF THIS FUNDING IS ONE TIME FUNDING AND IT ADDS UP TO ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF THAT TOTAL TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS FOR PLANNING GRANTS FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. DIVIDED EQUALLY WITH AND REGIONAL AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION ALLOCATED FOR EACH. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS FOR THE INFO INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM RESPONDING TO THE NEED THAT OFTEN HOUSING IS NOT BUILT BECAUSE THE LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND WHERE HOUSING MIGHT OTHERWISE BE BUILT IS NOT THERE TO SUPPORT IT SAID THIS HELP SOLVE THAT ISSUE. I SHOULD ADD THAT WITHIN THAT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE AND FOR INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAMS NINETY MILLION DOLLARS IS SET ASIDE FOR RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE -- THESE ARE COUNTIES WITH FEWER THAN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE I IN ADDITION THERE'S FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO CAL HFA FOR THE NEXT INCOME LOAN PROGRAM. AND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO EXPAND THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT -- AS WELL WITHIN OUR HOUSING PROGRAMS THERE ARE PROGRAMS THAT AWARD BONUS POINTS FOR JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE REALLY STACKING STEPPING UP AND TAKING THE WEIGHT ON HOUSING -- WITH REGARD TO HOMELESSNESS -- THE OVERALL BUDGET INCLUDES ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW INVESTMENT. IN THIS TRAILER BILL BEFORE YOU INCLUDES ABOUT SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT. OF THAT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS FOR WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE BIG THIRTEEN CITIES SAID THESE ARE THE THIRTEEN CITIES IN CALIFORNIA WITH OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THEM. A ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS ALLOCATED TO COUNTIES ONE HUNDRED NINETY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THESE CONTINUUM'S OF CARE THESE ARE FEDERALLY DESIGNATED AREAS AND THEN FINALLY TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO BE PROGRAMS. AT A LATER DATE -- AND THEN IN ADDITION -- AFTER NEGOTIATIONS IN CONVERSATIONS WITH LEGISLATORS AND LEGISLATIVE STAFF -- WE'VE EXPANDED THE USES OF THIS FUNDING SO THAT THE LOCAL LEVEL CAN BE FLEXIBLE FINALLY -- AFTER A LOT OF CONVERSATION -- WE'VE REFINED AT THE ADMINISTRATION -- SOME OF THE REMEDIES FOR JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE HOUSING ELEMENT LAW AND THIS INCLUDES ONLY AFTER THE ORDER OF A COURT AND AFTER AN ADDITIONAL YEAR HAS ELAPSED SOME FINES AS WELL AS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE COURT MAY APPOINT AN AGENT. TO BRING THAT JURISDICTION TO GO INTO COMPLIANCE SO THOSE ARE THREE OF THE KEY AREAS AND WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER WHAT. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. CATTLE ONLY APPEAR. LIKE TOMORROW IS A HOLIDAY OR SOMETHING. I HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT -- THE BILL AND LET ME START BY TALKING FOCUSING ON THE PART THAT GIVES THE STATE REMEDIES INCLUDING FINDS IN APPOINTING AN AGENT OF THE COURT -- FOR BRINGING CITIES INTO COMPLIANCE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ONLY PENALIZING CITIES FOR THESE ELEMENTS OF THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT THAT ARE UNDER THEIR CONTROL -- THINGS LIKE ZONING AND PLANNING AND NOT FOR BECAUSE I KNOW THE GOVERNOR ORIGINALLY HAD PROPOSED WITH THE SP ONE MONEY TO PENALIZE CITIES FOR FAILING TO PRODUCE HOUSING. WHICH I THINK WAS UNFAIR BECAUSE IT PENALIZES PERSON SOMETHING CITIES FOR SOMETHING THAT WASN'T IN THEIR CONTROL YOU KNOW THE THE ACTUAL PRODUCTION HOUSING WHICH IS NOT THE CITY'S JOB. SO THIS IS JUST FOR THE ZONING AND PLANNING ELEMENTS OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT FREE CITY RIGHT THAT'S CORRECT THIS BILL IS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE EXISTING HOUSING ELEMENT LAW SO IT DOES NOT HAVE THAT PRODUCTION IT AS A PRODUCTION GOAL -- BUT THE LEGAL STANDARD IS WHETHER YOUR ZONING AND PLANNING FOR THE HOUSING AS PRESCRIBED BY LAW. OKAY THANK YOU AND I'M TALKING ABOUT THE GRANT FUNDING SO WE'VE GOT TO BIG POOLS OF MONEY HERE WE GOT THE INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM AND THEN THE HAP. PROGRAM -- WE HAD ASKED FOR A SET ASIDE FOR SMALL AND RURAL CITIES AND COUNTIES FOR BOTH PROGRAMS AND I'M VERY HAPPY THAT WE GOT THAT 18% SET ASIDE. FOR A INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE BUT THE THE THAT WE DID NOT GET THAT SET ASIDE FOR THE HALF PROGRAM IS THAT CORRECT. DON'T BELIEVE SO OR TURNED OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE. DANIELLE BRENDA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I DON'T BELIEVE WE SET A MINIMUM FOR THE SMALL JURISDICTIONS. OKAY. YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S KIND OF A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE SMALLER JURISDICTIONS ALSO HAVE A LARGE AND GROWING HOMELESS PROBLEM. THEIR PARTS OF MY DISTRICT WHERE WE'RE SEEING HOMELESSNESS WHERE WE HAVE NEVER SEEN HOMELESSNESS IN THE PAST. AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE SMALLER JURISDICTIONS TO COMPETE WITH BIG JURISDICTIONS LIKE LOS ANGELES FOR THESE FUNDS SO -- I I REALLY HOPE THAT IN THE FUTURE WE LOOK AT AT MAKING IT EASIER FOR THOSE SMALLER JURISDICTIONS TO COMPETE AND SETTING ASIDE A PORTION OF THE MONEY. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROBLEM GETS ADDRESSED IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE STATE AS WELL. THANK YOU ANY. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MR LOOK. I'M THINKING BACK -- TO I THINK IT WAS TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHEN WE PASSED THE OF BIG HOUSING PACKAGE AND PART OF THAT WAS A. B.. SEVENTY TWO I THINK IT WAS MISTER SANTIAGO IS LEGISLATION ON ENFORCEMENT. HOW DO THESE THINGS WORK TOGETHER? CENTS EXIST I GUESS THE QUESTION IS HOW DOES THE EXISTING ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM WORK TOGETHER WITH WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED. SURE FOR H. CD'S THE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE EIGHTY SEVEN SORRY AB SEVENTY TWO HOT PIE TO EACH CITIES REVIEW AND OF THE COMPLY -- THE HOUSING ELEMENT OVERALL THIS -- TRAILER BILL. REFERS TO WHAT HAPPENS AFTER EACH CITIES CONTINUED EFFORTS TO GET A JURISDICTION INTO COMPLIANCE. SO THIS WOULD BE -- JUDICIAL REMEDIES AFTERTHOUGHT REMEDIES AFTER -- AB SEVENTY TWO HAS BEEN EXHAUSTED. SO SEQUENTIAL THEN THIS DOESN'T COME INTO PLAY. UNTIL AFTER A BEAST THE REMEDIES UNDER AB SEVENTY TWO ARE COMPLETELY. YEAH I GUESS I'LL MAKE -- TWO POINTS ABOUT IT FIRST IS THAT IN THOSE REMEDY STILL EXIST -- BUT THIS CLARIFIES THE PROCEDURE BEFORE THE PARTIES ENTER INTO ANY TYPE OF LAWSUIT BECAUSE THERE ARE THERE'S A NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT THAT A TV HAS TO HAVE TWO MEETINGS WITH THE JURISDICTION THAT IT BELIEVES IS. OUT OF COMPLIANCE AND THEN THE SECOND THING THAT THIS BILL DOES THERE'S A LOT OF FOCUS ON THE REMEDIES AND YOU KNOW HOW THEY CAN BE ENFORCED AGAINST A JURISDICTION. BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES THE ELEMENTS THAT IF THE COURT DECIDES THAT THE JURISDICTION HAS COME BACK INTO SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. EVEN IF EIGHT C. D. MIGHT CONTEST AT DETERMINATION THAT COURTS AT DETERMINATION WOULD GOVERN. OKAY THANK YOU. BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS IN FAVOR OF THE PROPOSAL. MR ON WITH THE GOOD MISTER RAMOS EXCUSE ME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SORRY FOR THE DELAYED. REACTION TO YOUR QUESTION BUT I'M I DID COME IN A LITTLE BIT LATE NOT SURE IF YOU COVERED IT BUT AND SOME OF THE BACKGROUND MATERIAL THERE IS A CUT OFF WITH -- POPULATIONS OF CITIES -- TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ARE. THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND SO. ASKING THE QUESTION HOW DID WE ARRIVE AT THAT POPULATION CUT OFF. WHEN? YOU KNOW. THE AREA THAT I SERVE THE FOURTEENTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT THE CITY OF SABATINO HAS A HIGH -- POPULATION OF HOMELESSNESS AND NEEDS ARE THERE BUT YET UNDER THAT CRITERIA THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR THE MAJOR -- FUNDING STREAM OF THAT SO. HOW DID WE REACH THAT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION VERSUS? TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND I'LL MAKE A COUPLE POINTS DURING THE FIRST MOST IMPORTANT IS THAT THAT FUNDING WHILE SIGNIFICAN IS ACTUALLY STILL LESS THAN HALF OF THE OVERALL HOMELESS THIS FUNDING SO. AT THIS TRAILER BILL HAS SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL -- AND THAT AMOUNT IS TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION SO IT IS A BIG POT BUT IT IS STILL LESS THAN HALF OF THE OVERALL BEFORE YOU. ARE THE SECOND IS -- SO LAST YEAR'S PROGRAM WHICH WAS CALLED A HEAP I BELIEVE IT'S A HOMELESS EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. THAT ALLOCATED -- FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVERALL VERY SIX FIFTEEN THE BILL BEFORE YOU -- AND POT THAT WAS SEQUESTERED FOR BIG CITIES HAD THE BIGGEST ELEVEN CITIES -- SO WE ACTUALLY DROPPED -- IN THIS YEAR'S ACTION THE POPULATION LOWER INITIALLY WAS HIGHER THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND NOW WE DROPPED TWO TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND THAT ACCOMPLISHED -- TO ADDITIONAL CITIES SO NOW RATHER THAN THE ELEVEN BIGGEST CITIES INCLUDES THE THIRTEENTH BIGGEST CITIES -- INCLUDING STOPPED AND AND I BELIEVE RIVERSIDE IS THE OTHER CITY THAT WAS INCLUDED -- BUT WE DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION DEAD DOES BOY THAT THOSE CITIES HAVE UNIQUE NEEDS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED -- BUT THE BALANCE OF THE FUNDING MORE THAN HALF GOES TO COUNTIES AND GOES TO THE CONVENIENCE OF CARE WHICH ARE THESE FEDERALLY DESIGNATED JURISDICTIONS THAT. GO ACROSS THE STATE AND SO -- ALL AREAS OF THE STATE WILL BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THAT MONEY. SO EVEN -- WITH WITH THAT EXPLOSION THROUGH THE CHAIR -- IT TOOK ABOUT HOW IT'S NOT IN THE FUNDING. TO TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION THERE'S A THE THE NUMBER THAT'S THERE BUT YET IT'S ONLY THIRTEEN CITIES OUT OF OVER. FOUR HUNDRED SO. IF THERE IS -- ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AS FAR AS MAYBE NOW OR OR AS FAR AS LOOKING AT POPULATIONS OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PLUS. WITH THEN START -- TO ACCOUNT FOR MAYBE. TWENTY TWO CITIES OUT OF FOUR HUNDRED STARTING TO HAVE AN IMPACT. I'M JUST BRINGING THAT UP BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN -- PRIOR AT THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND NOW AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR THE AREA HOW THE HOMELESS POPULATION CONTINUES TO GROW. AND HOW. FUNDING CONTINUES TO BE DETERMINED AND GO ELSEWHERE WHEN WE'RE FACED WITH THE SAME SITUATIONS -- WITHIN WITHIN OUR AREAS SO -- WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE FURTHER DIALOGUE TO SEE IF WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT SOME ON THE THE POPULATION BASE IN THE CHIU NEEDS A OF THE CITIES THAT ARE BEING IMPACTED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ABSOLUTELY NOT JUST ON THIS FROM LOCAL CLARIFY SO. ON COUNTIES -- WILL BE GETTING A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION SO AGAIN OBVIOUSLY. THAT THE CITIES THAT ARE NOT IN THE BIG THIRTEEN SHOULD DEFINITELY WORK WITH THE COUNTY IS. TO GET APPROPRIATE HELP IN ADDITION A HUNDRED AND NINETY MILLION WHEN TO CONTINUUM'S OF CARE. IN EVERY COUNTY OR OR REGION HAS A CONTINUUM OF CARE AND SO FOR CITIES ARE STARTING TO SEE THAT IMPACT I WOULD DEFINITELY. ASK THEM TO WORK WITH THEIR CONTEMPT OF CARE TO REALLY DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE ON THE OTHER THE OTHER REASON THERE IS SUCH A FOCUS ON THE LARGE THIRTEEN CITIES. HI I BELIEVE THEY HAVE ABOUT. POPULATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO AGAIN DIDN'T GET 75% OF THE MONEY THEY THEY WOULD HAVE LOVED THAT. BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THIS MAKES WAS WAS APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE NEED IN AGAIN -- THE CITIES OF THESE CITIES WERE THE ONES THAT REALLY BY FAR HAVE THE LARGEST -- POPULATIONS OF HOMELESS PEOPLE. THANK YOU FOR THAT EXPLANATION OF MISTER CHAIR AND LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER DIALOGUE THANK YOU. OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] MISS AGUIAR-CURRY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I'M APPRECIATIVE OF THIS BILL AS A PACKAGE -- IT MAKES SENSE TO ME TO FIRST INCENTIVIZE LOCAL. AGENCIES THAT TO DO BETTER PLANNING. I'M HAVE YOU SEE THE PLAN SUPPORTS GRANTS PROGRAM AND ALSO THE IN FILL INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IN THE TRAILER BILL. I'M ESPECIALLY HAPPY THAT RURAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE A SATISFIED IN SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THE INTEREST IN FILL INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM. THE SMALL CITIES AND TOWNS THAT I REPRESENT HAVE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES ATTRACTING IN DELIVERING HOUSING AND THE PROGRAM ACKNOWLEDGES THIS. THIS BILL WILL GIVE LOCAL AGENCIES A CHANCE TO USE THIS FUNDING TO IMPROVE LOCAL PLANNING. STREAMLINED LOCAL PROCESSES AND LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR ACTUALLY DELIVERING HOUSING. INITIALLY I HAD CONCERNS ABOUT COURT ACTIONS AGAINST LOCALS WHERE THE LINE IS DRAWN FOR LOCAL CONTROL. IF THE GOAL IS ACCOMPLISHING HOUSING ELEMENT COMPLIANCE THE THE GRADUALLY ESCALATING REMEDIES AND THE MULTIPLE AVENUES FOR A CITY OR COUNTY TO CORRECT ITS COURSE ALONG THE WAY GIVE ME MUCH MORE COMFORT. I ALSO APPRECIATE THE LANGUAGE THE ALLOWS THE COURT TO CONSIDER MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHY IS CITY OR COUNTY MAY NOT BE IN COMPLIANCE. OUR CURRENT TEN TENDENCIES TO LUMP LOCALS WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO ATTRACTED DELIVER HOUSING WITH THOSE TO PUT UP BARRIERS TO DEVELOP IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. FOR FOR FOR THE FORMER THE CARROTS IN THIS PACKAGE WILL ACCOMPLISH OUR GOAL. FOR THE LATTER I JOIN WITH MY COLLEAGUES WHO WANT TO FORCE RESPONSIBLE DELIVERY OF THE HOUSING OUR STATE DESPERATELY NEEDS. I WANT TO THANK THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE AND STAFF TO ADMINISTRATION IS THE SENATE LEADERSHIP THE BUT AT THE BUDGET CHAIRS A BUDGET STAFF. AND MY LOCAL GOVERNMENT STUFF THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER. COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS. WE'LL GO TO PUBLIC COME AT THE START THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS NICOLE ORNAMENT ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND SAN BERNADINO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE HOMELESSNESS FUNDING. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S LEGISLATURE'S PROPOSALS AS WELL AS ALL OF THE STAFF WORK THAT HAS GONE INTO THIS PACKAGE. IN TERMS OF ORANGE COUNTY WE ARE PARTICULARLY GRATEFUL FOR THE CHANGES TO THE LOCAL HOUSING TRUST FUND LANGUAGE ALLOWING SB THREE AS A MATCH. AND FOR SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE FUNDING GOING TO BOTH COUNTIES AND CEO SEES. CHRISLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES STRONGLY SUPPORT OF THE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION FOR THE HOMELESS AID PROGRAM. ESPECIALLY THE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION DIRECTLY TO COUNTIES COUNTIES ARE THE SAFETY NET PROVIDERS FOR THE STATE WE THINK THEY'RE VERY WELL POSITIONED TO IDENTIFY THE GAPS IN OUR CURRENT PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT THE HOMELESS. AND BETTER TACKLE THE CRISIS STATEWIDE WE'RE ALSO VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM. ESPECIALLY THE 18% SET ASIDE FOR AN OVER THE COUNTER PROCESS FOR MORE RURAL SMALLER JURISDICTIONS -- IN PRIOR ROUNDS OF THE INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM THERE'D BEEN VERY FEW APPLICATIONS AWARDED TO PROJECTS IN UNINCORPORATED AREAS BUT THEY HAVE THE SAME OBLIGATION TO PLAN FOR HOUSING SO WE'RE REALLY EXCITED NOT JUST ABOUT THAT SET ASIDE. BUT ALSO ABOUT THE THE WORK THAT THE COMMITTEE DID IN COMING UP WITH A BROADER INFILL DEFINITION THAT WILL REALLY HELP THOSE COMMUNITIES ALSO DELIVER HOUSING. FINALLY WHILE WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PRECEDENT SETTING NATURE OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS WE ARE NEUTRAL ON THAT ASPECT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. CAN LOS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR YEAR THAN WHEN I APPRECIATE THE LANGUAGE AROUND THE LOW BARRIER NAVIGATION CENTER IS INCLUDED IN THE BILL AS WELL AS THE CONTINUATION OF A SET ASIDE FOR YOU -- AT 8% AND THERE AND REALLY APPRECIATE THE DEFINITION THAT MATCHES -- OTHER POLICY AREAS THAT WERE CAPTURING MINORS -- UNDER EIGHTEEN AND YOUTH OVER EIGHTEEN AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS DESIGNED FOR THEM AS WELL AS ENSURING THAT THE DOLLARS ARE BEING USED IN COORDINATION LOCALLY. SO THAT WERE REALLY COMPLEMENTING THE EFFORTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN GOING TO PLAN AN ADDRESS AND AND HOMELESSNESS THANK YOU. JR MEMBERS ROSS BUT THE ON BEHALF OF SOUTH AMERICA GAL STAMBERG LIKE TO THINK THAT MINISTRATION BOTH HOUSES FOR THE ON GOING -- HOMELESS ON THE GOOD MORNING CHAIRS AND MEMBERS MARINO WENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE FUNDING COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISES AND THE STATE -- BUT I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T JUST NOTE THAT AS CO SPONSORS OF AB SEVENTY TWO WE DO THINK THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE GOALS OF THE ADMINISTRATION. AND THE GOALS OF AB SEVENTY TWO AND A LIKE TO KIND OF FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CLEAN CLEAN UP THAT LANGUAGE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING BILL HIGGINS WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION COUNCILS OF GOVERNMENTS -- HERE TO SUPPORT THE PLANNING LANGUAGE IN THE PLANNING FUNDING IN THE BILL IN THE INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDS WE THINK THAT. THIS WILL NOT ONLY HELP AUGMENT THE LOCAL EFFORTS ON THE GROUND IN THE AREAS WHERE THE ARE GOING TO BE ASKED TO PRODUCE THE HIGHEST AMOUNT OF PRODUCTION IT WILL ALSO HELP COMMUNITIES. THROUGH REGIONAL RESOURCES THAT -- MAY NOT HAVE THE THE RESOURCES ON THEIR OWN BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY SMALL THAT WILL BE ABLE TO AUGMENT THEIR EFFORTS. AND ALSO WILL BE ABLE TO TAILOR THIS IN WITH OUR CLIMATE GOAL SO THE IDEA IS THAT. WE CAN PROVIDE SOME REGIONAL FLEXIBILITY TO THIS MONEY BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS NOT THE SAME STRATEGY YOU NEED IN THE BAY AREA WILL HAVE SOME OF THAT FLEXIBILITY AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO REPORTING OUT. TO YOU ABOUT OUR SUCCESSES IN THAT EFFORT THANK YOU [inaudible] JEFF TORTILLA [inaudible] ADVOCATES -- ANYTHING WE DO FOR HOMELESS ANYTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT UNDERSTANDING BETTER -- I'M HOPING THAT NON PROFITS WILL BE INCLUDED. IN THERE PARTICULARLY BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL NEED TO MEANS OF ADDRESSING WHAT ON THE UNDER ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR. RENTAL MARKET SO AFFORDABLE HOUSING ACCESSIBLE HOUSING IS SOMETHING THAT IS BECOMING A PRIMARY IMPORTANCE ITS TO TEN YEARS FOR THIS. IT'LL PROBABLY TAKE YOU TEN YEARS TO GET CLOSER ON IT BUT SUPPORT. THANK YOU JUST QUICK QUICK COMMENT ON THE NONPROFIT TO DEFINITELY INCLUDED IN THE CONTINUES OF CARE. SOURCE OF FUNDING IN OBVIOUSLY THE FUNDING DOESN'T EXCLUDE CITIES OR COUNTIES FROM WORKING WITH NON PROFITS [inaudible] ANY OTHER. COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OKAY.
