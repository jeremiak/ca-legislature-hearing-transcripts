OR LOW COST ADMISSION TO INDIVIDUALS PRESENTING AN EBT CARD AND A VALID FORM OF AN ID THIS BILL. ALSO WOULD FURTHER THE VISION OF A GOVERNOR BROWN AND CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE TO ENHANCE OPPORTUNITIES.

RECENTLY I WAS SPEAKING TO YOUNG SMOLYAN WOMAN. WHO LIVES IN THE LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOOD OF CITY HEIGHTS IN SAN DIEGO? IT'S ACTUALLY NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE I WENT TO SCHOOL AS A TEENAGER. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW PEOPLE FROM HER COMMUNITY DON'T GO TO MUSEUMS AND THE PRIMARY REASON WHY IS THAT THE COST OF ENTRY. I LOOK BACK ON MY TIME LIVING IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AND GOING TO SCHOOL THERE. IT'S A NEIGHBORHOODS VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART. AND HOW I DON'T SEE THOSE RESIDENTS COMING TO MUSEUM LIKE MINE. I WANT THEM TO FEEL WELCOME INCLUDED IN WHAT WE DO. AND I KNOW THAT IS NOT EASY FOR MUSEUMS LIKE MY TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES. IT'S MY ROLE AS DIRECTOR OF INNOVATION TO FIND SOLUTIONS FOR CHALLENGES LIKE THESE. WE KNOW THE GIVING FREE OR REDUCED ADMISSION. ALLOWS THESE KINDS OF MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. TO GIVE THEM GREATER ACCESS AND EQUITY TO THESE IMPORTANT CULTURAL EXPERIENCES. AS A LEADER TO SMALL MUSEUM. I ALSO KNOW HOW TOUGH IT IS. TO MAKE THESE OPPORTUNITIES A REALITY WHEN IT COMES TO MONEY. SMALLER MUSEUMS RELY ON THE INCOME FOR ADMISSIONS TO SUPPORT THEIR WORK. IN BALBOA PARK IN SAN DIEGO. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF SMALLER MUSEUMS LIKE THAT MODEL RAILROAD MUSEUM. RECEIVE EAGLE OUR INSTITUTE AND THE VETERANS MUSEUM AND MEMORIAL CENTER. AND THEY WOULD NEED FUNDS LIKE THESE IF THEY WANT OPEN ACCESS TO THESE KINDS OF COMMUNITIES.

TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT THE SOUNDS HE MUSEUM OF ART BY APPLYING FOR THE NATIONAL MUSEUMS FOR ALL PROGRAM HOWEVER CURRENTLY THERE IS NOT A STRONG INSTITUTIONAL MARKETING EFFORT THAT IMPOSSIBLE STAFF AND RESIDENTS OF THIS CULTURAL OPPORTUNITY. THIS PROGRAM WILL SUPPORT MUSEUMS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY PROGRAMS THAT CAN HELP BRIDGE A GAP. THIRD THOUGH THERE IS A NATIONAL MUSEUM FOR ALL PROGRAM IS A STATE EFFORT THAT WILL HELP BUILD A STRONG MARKETING BETWEEN MUSEUMS IN THE COMMUNITY PROGRAMS. CURRENTLY THERE ARE TWO MUSEUMS IN SILICON VALLEY AND SAN JOSE THAT ARE PARTICIPATING MUSEUMS FOR THE NATIONAL EFFORT. AND THERE ARE OVER TWENTY MUSEUMS THE SILICON VALLEY ALONE THAT CAN BENEFIT FROM A CALIFORNIA EFFORT THAT ENCOURAGES RESIDENTS TO GAUGE WITH MUSEUMS. THE SAN JOSE MUSEUM OF ART SUPPORTS THE BILL'S INTEND TO CREATE A CALIFORNIA BASED PROGRAM THAT WILL OFFER. INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WITH ELECTRONIC BENEFIT TRANSFER EBT CARDS. FREE OR LOW VERY LOW COST ADMISSION TO MUSEUMS AND PROVIDE A MODEST GRANT PARTICIPATING CALIFORNIA MUSEUMS. AT THE SAN JOSE MUSEUM OF ART RESTRAIN I'VE TO GIVE PEOPLE FROM ALL COMMUNITIES ACCESS TO OUR AND ITS POWER TO INSPIRE CHANGE.

MOST GO BLOOM. RE PRESENTING AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY SIX. LORD FURIOUS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SIGN HERE PRESENT AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY SIX WHICH IS A BILL RELATING TO THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL GRANT PROGRAM. THE PROCESS FOR APPROVING GRANT APPLICATIONS AT THE ARTS COUNCIL INCLUDES A PEER REVIEW PANEL THAT IS COMPRISED OF EXPERTS IN VARIOUS. ARTISTIC FIELDS WHO REPRESENT A WIDE ARRAY OF DIVERSE GROUPS AND COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE. THIS BILL PROVIDES THE AUTHORITY. PROVIDE SOME AUTHORITY TO THE OUT ARTS COUNCIL TO PROVIDE AN HONORARIUM TO MEMBERS. THE PANEL FOR THEIR. TIME. I THAT. TIME TYPICALLY IS. A GOOD DEAL OF TIME IS TAKEN TO MEET WITH REVIEW AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AFTER GRANT AWARDS. THIS IS IMPORTANT SINCE PANELISTS ARE OFTEN CHALLENGED IN THEIR ABILITY TO AFFORD THE A SPAT EXPENSES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GRANT PROCESS. AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY SIX IS THE BEST WAY TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF GRANT REVIEWERS AND WILL HELP EXPEDITE THE FLOW OF ADDITIONAL. FUNDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY GIVEN TO THE ARTS COUNCIL. SUPPORT THE GRANTEES AND NEW PROGRAMS WHICH OF COURSE IS THE LEGISLATURE'S GOAL. THE AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE HONORARY WILL IMPROVE THE COUNCIL'S ABILITY. TO INVOLVE A DIVERSE GROUP OF GRANT PANELISTS WHICH WILL OFFSET THE COST THE PANELISTS WILL OTHERWISE HAVE TO BEAR AND WILL ENSURE DIVERSITY IN THE PROCESS. I HAVE THOUGHT AND BOUND CRAWFORD WITH ME HERE TODAY WHO IS AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE AND IS BOUND CRAWFORD IS THE NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA ARTS CAL. BUT BUT BUT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING. HOW AM THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM? FOR SUPPORTING AN AUTHORING THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THE COMMITTEE. FOR. ATTENUATING TO SUPPORT THE ARTS AND CREATIVITY IN CALIFORNIA. AND FOR HIGH FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO THAT. I AM AS YOU HEARD AND BROWN CRAWFORD I'M THE NEWBIE HERE. M. CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL. I THINK I'VE REACHED MY HUNDREDTH DAY. SO. KM I'M STILL SHINY. OUR I WAS APPOINTED BY GOVERNOR BROWN IN DECEMBER AND STARTED IN JANUARY. I'M AN EDUCATOR I'M ARTS EDUCATION ADVOCATE AND I'M A CREATIVE ECONOMY CHAMPION AND A RURAL RESIDENT. EVEN THOUGH I WAS RAISED IN CHICAGO I'VE BEEN UP IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY FOR FOUR DECADES. SO THEM I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPOSSESSED FROM THE REST OF THE STATE. I LIVE IN SACRAMENTO NOW. WHICH I'M ENJOYING BY THE WAY. AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK AS YOU HEARD ON BEHALF OF AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY SIX. YEAH I'M A BILL FOR THE COUNCIL. YOU ALL KNOW THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL IS THE STATE'S ARTS AGENCY. AS A DIRECTOR I WORK ALONGSIDE THE STAFF AND THE COUNCIL BODY ITSELF WHICH ARE ALL APPOINTEES. AM NINE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR ONE BY THE ASSEMBLY AND ONE BY THE. SENATE. THROUGH THIS BILL WERE SEEKING AUTHORIZATION TO PROVIDE PEER REVIEW PANELISTS AN HONORARIUM. AND THE PRACTICES COMMON IN OTHER STATES AND. PUREVIEW PANELS ARE SET AT THE CORE OF WHAT WE DO. M. AS A GRANT MAKING. GRANT FUNDING ORGANIZATION AS PART OF A MULTI STEP. THE OUR PROCESS THAT WE HAVE FOR REVIEWING ALL OF OUR GRANT APPLICATIONS. AS A STATE AGENCY WE BEGAN THE CONVERSATION ON THE ISSUE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND. GOVERNOR BROWN APPROVED OUR ABILITY TO BRING FORTH A. B.. TWENTY FOUR FIFTY SIX. THAT WILL ALLOW THE ARTS COUNCIL TO CLEAN UP ARE ENABLING LEGISLATION SO BETTER REFLECTS THE WORK THAT WE DO TODAY. AND OUR AGENCY BUDGET HAS INCREMENTALLY INCREASED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. WHICH IS WONDERFUL HIM WITH THAT INCREASE IN BUDGET OUR NEED FOR PEER REVIEW PANELISTS HAS ALREADY INCREASED. AND IT. WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY GRANT APPLICATIONS RIGHT NOW. FULLER ARE THE PROGRAMS THAT WE FUND. AND WE ANTICIPATE EIGHTY PUREVIEW PANELISTS TO COME AND. ADJUDICATE THOSE GRANTS. AT THAT. MAKES UP MORE THAN TWENTY PANEL MEETINGS. YEAH I'M EACH MEETING LAST FROM ONE TO THREE DAYS AND CONSISTS OF BETWEEN THREE TO FIVE PANELISTS. THIS ISN'T A FUNDING REQUEST BUT. IT SIMPLY ALLOWS US THE AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE THE HONORARIUM FOR EACH DAY OF SERVICE FOR EACH PANEL MEMBER WHEN THEY COME TO SACRAMENTO. THE LEGISLATION WILL HELP US BETTER REFLECT THE UNIQUENESS OF CALIFORNIA'S SIZE AND DIVERSITY. AND. SHOW RESPECT TO THOSE WHO SERVE OUR HOPE TO SERVE IN THIS CAPACITY. HAD ON THE PANELISTS INSURE THAT ARE GRANT APPLICATION REVIEW PROCESS IS DEMOCRATIC FAIR AND REPRESENTATIVE. OF CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE GEOGRAPHY. DIFFERENT TYPES AND SIZES OF ORGANIZATIONS. DIFFERENT AGES RACIAL ETHNIC GENDER IDENTITIES AND MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES THAT EXIST THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE PANELIST SUPPLY THROUGH AN OPEN PUBLIC APPLICATION PROCESS. AND OUR COUNCIL REVIEWS AND APPROVES POR PANELISTS EACH YEAR. PANELISTS HAVE IN DEPTH EXPERIENCE IN VARIOUS OUR PRACTICES DISCIPLINES AND A. THERE THEY RANGE FROM ARTS LEARNING. PRE K. THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT JUVENILE AND ADULT. PROGRAMMING IN CORRECTIONS. YEAH I NONPROFIT MANAGEMENT MEDIAN TECHNOLOGY ARTS IN HEALING UM AS WELL AS WORKING WITH. VETERAN POPULATIONS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND OTHER RELATED FIELDS. WE. HAVE EMERGING AND EXPERIENCE ARTS ADMINISTRATORS. ARTISTS AND ARTS POLICY MEMBERS THAT WE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY TO BE. A PANELIST. THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO SERVE NOT ONLY GIVE THEIR TIME AND EXPERTISE BUT RECEIVE GREAT VALUE IN THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAT THEY GET FROM BEING PART OF THAT PROCESS. AND THE GROWTH THAT COMES FROM THAT. BEING INVOLVED IN THAT SO WHEN THEY GO BACK TO THEIR. AND COMMUNITIES THEY'RE ABLE TO USE WHAT THEY LEARNED THROUGH THE PROCESS IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITY SO IT'S A BALANCED EQUATION. IT AT THAT THINK. EQUATIONS LIKE THIS SHOULD NEVER BE ON BALANCE SO AS MUCH AS THEY GIVE THE TAKE HOME. AS READ RECENTLY TALKING TO PANELISTS IT BASED THAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT THEY SAY IS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY CLAIM LEARNING SO MUCH.

WHEN THEY GET TO SACRAMENTO THEY COLLECTIVELY REVIEW AND RANK ALL THE APPLICATIONS. I THINK THAT FOR ME THE SHORT ANSWER SINCE I NEED TO WRAP UP IS THAT THIS IS ABOUT SHOWING RESPECT AND AND. AND DOING WHAT. MANY OTHER ARTS AGENCIES DO IS SHOW THAT RESPECT THROUGH HONORARIUM AS. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS BEFORE I. GOOD DO WILL BE OPPORTUNITY FOR TO QUESTIONS OVER OKAY GOOD I LIKE I SAID I'M A NEWBIE SO. ARE YOU HAVE A CRYSTAL ELECT AS SOMETHING QUICKLY TO. THANK YOU.
