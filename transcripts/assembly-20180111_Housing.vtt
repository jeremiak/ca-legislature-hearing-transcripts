CRISIS.

00:22:53.872 --> 00:22:58.611 region:rollup2
AT THIS TIME ONE THIRD OF ALL

00:22:56.508 --> 00:23:00.179 region:rollup2
RENTERS PAY MORE THAN A HALF OF

00:22:58.611 --> 00:23:02.081 region:rollup2
THEIR INCOME TOWARD RENT. WHEN

00:23:00.179 --> 00:23:04.416 region:rollup2
YOU ADD TRANSPORTATION COST

00:23:02.081 --> 00:23:04.950 region:rollup2
NUMBER JUMPS DRAMATICALLY.

00:23:04.416 --> 00:23:07.286 region:rollup2
AS WE'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:09.088 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING

00:23:07.286 --> 00:23:10.789 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY IS OUT PACING

00:23:09.088 --> 00:23:12.524 region:rollup2
INCOME GROWTH AT A LEVEL THAT IS

00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:14.760 region:rollup2
SIMPLY UNSUSTAINABLE.

00:23:12.524 --> 00:23:16.629 region:rollup2
AS OF THE END OF THIS PAST YEAR.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.163 region:rollup2
IN MY CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO YOU

00:23:16.629 --> 00:23:19.298 region:rollup2
SAW ONE BEDROOM APARTMENTS THAT

00:23:18.163 --> 00:23:20.733 region:rollup2

FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH ON

00:23:20.733 --> 00:23:24.136 region:rollup2
AVERAGE.

00:23:22.201 --> 00:23:25.971 region:rollup2
TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT RENTS ARE

CALIFORNIA PROJECTS TRIPLE DIGIT

RENT INCREASES TO HIT MUCH OF

00:23:34.079 --> 00:23:38.183 region:rollup2
THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION.

00:23:35.447 --> 00:23:40.286 region:rollup2
OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS

00:23:38.183 --> 00:23:42.154 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO APP I SEE SURVEY

00:23:40.286 --> 00:23:43.856 region:rollup2
FROM THIS PAST FALL.

00:23:42.154 --> 00:23:44.823 region:rollup2
RENTERS ARE TWICE AS LIKELY AS

00:23:43.856 --> 00:23:46.325 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERS TO SAY THAT THERE

00:23:44.823 --> 00:23:48.327 region:rollup2
HOUSING COSTS ARE CAUSING A

00:23:46.325 --> 00:23:48.861 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL STRAIN SIXTY ONE

PERCENT.

00:23:50.896 --> 00:23:53.866 region:rollup2
A AT THIS TIME A THIRD OF ALL

00:23:52.598 --> 00:23:55.167 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS ARE SAYING THAT THE

00:23:53.866 --> 00:23:56.235 region:rollup2
COST OF HOUSING IS MAKING THEM

00:23:55.167 --> 00:23:57.736 region:rollup2
SERIOUSLY CONSIDER MOVING OUT OF

00:23:56.235 --> 00:23:59.405 region:rollup2
THE STATE.

00:23:57.736 --> 00:24:00.639 region:rollup2
OVER HALF OF ALL RENTERS ARE

00:23:59.405 --> 00:24:02.675 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING LEAVING THEIR REGION

00:24:00.639 --> 00:24:03.542 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA.

00:24:02.675 --> 00:24:05.144 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ALSO HAS A

00:24:03.542 --> 00:24:06.845 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF OUR

00:24:06.845 --> 00:24:09.581 region:rollup2
IN THE LAST TWO YEARS

00:24:08.314 --> 00:24:11.684 region:rollup2

ONE PERCENT OF ALL PEOPLE WHO

EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS IN THE

00:24:15.955 --> 00:24:19.758 region:rollup2
UNITED STATES.

00:24:17.756 --> 00:24:21.393 region:rollup2
WE ALL KNOW THE IMPACTS OF THIS

00:24:19.758 --> 00:24:22.928 region:rollup2
CRISIS ON TENANTS WHO COULD BE

00:24:21.393 --> 00:24:23.362 region:rollup2

ASSEMBLY. THE LEGISLATURE PASSED

00:26:25.384 --> 00:26:29.354 region:rollup2
IN THE GOVERNOR SIGN NUMEROUS

00:26:27.152 --> 00:26:31.857 region:rollup2
PIECES OF LANDMARK LEGISLATION

00:26:29.354 --> 00:26:33.892 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING THE STATE'S RAPIDLY

00:26:31.857 --> 00:26:35.494 region:rollup2
ESCALATING HOUSING CRISIS.

00:26:33.892 --> 00:26:36.862 region:rollup2
WE CREATED NEW FUNDING STREAMS

00:26:35.494 --> 00:26:39.064 region:rollup2
TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:26:36.862 --> 00:26:40.132 region:rollup2
BEGAN TO ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE OF

00:26:39.064 --> 00:26:41.834 region:rollup2
LAND ZONED FOR A HOUSING

00:26:40.132 --> 00:26:43.936 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT MANY AREAS OF THE

00:26:41.834 --> 00:26:45.370 region:rollup2
STATE. AND WE REMOVE BARRIERS TO

00:26:43.936 --> 00:26:47.773 region:rollup2
THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING AT

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:49.741 region:rollup2
ALL INCOME LEVELS.

00:26:47.773 --> 00:26:52.244 region:rollup2
SO WE CAN BE OPTIMISTIC THAT

00:26:49.741 --> 00:26:53.312 region:rollup2
OVER TIME THESE MEASURES WILL

00:26:52.244 --> 00:26:54.813 region:rollup2
MAKE A MEANINGFUL DENTON THE

00:26:53.312 --> 00:26:57.716 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION SHORTFALL THAT HAS

00:26:54.813 --> 00:26:58.884 region:rollup2
BEEN YEARS IN THE MAKING.

00:26:57.716 --> 00:27:00.719 region:rollup2
BUT WE HAVE TO BE FRANK WITH ONE

00:26:58.884 --> 00:27:01.954 region:rollup2
ANOTHER.

00:27:00.719 --> 00:27:04.089 region:rollup2
NEW UNITS INSUFFICIENT

00:27:01.954 --> 00:27:05.657 region:rollup2
QUANTITIES WILL TAKE YEARS TO

00:27:04.089 --> 00:27:07.493 region:rollup2
BUILD.

00:27:05.657 --> 00:27:09.628 region:rollup2
IN THE MEANTIME.

00:27:07.493 --> 00:27:11.430 region:rollup2
CURRENT DRAMATIC SHORTAGE OF

00:27:09.628 --> 00:27:13.332 region:rollup2
UNITS CONTRIBUTES TO RAPIDLY

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:15.434 region:rollup2
ESCALATING RENTS IN MUCH OF THE

00:27:13.332 --> 00:27:18.303 region:rollup2
STATE AFFECTING A VAST RANGE OF

00:27:15.434 --> 00:27:20.572 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS ON A DAILY BASIS

00:27:18.303 --> 00:27:22.608 region:rollup2
FROM YOUNG TO OLD. ACROSS ALL

00:27:20.572 --> 00:27:23.976 region:rollup2
ETHNIC GROUPS AND EVEN INCLUDING

00:27:22.608 --> 00:27:25.911 region:rollup2
THOSE HOLDING GOOD MIDDLE INCOME

00:27:23.976 --> 00:27:28.213 region:rollup2
JOBS.

00:27:25.911 --> 00:27:29.014 region:rollup2
NOT SURPRISINGLY.

00:27:28.213 --> 00:27:30.349 region:rollup2
THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE ABLE TO

00:27:29.014 --> 00:27:33.185 region:rollup2
WEATHER THE ECONOMIC STORM OF

00:27:30.349 --> 00:27:35.621 region:rollup2
THIS CRISIS ARE THE WEALTHY.

00:27:33.185 --> 00:27:37.556 region:rollup2
ALSO NOT SURPRISINGLY POOR AND

00:27:35.621 --> 00:27:40.159 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED CALIFORNIANS ARE

00:27:37.556 --> 00:27:42.160 region:rollup2
MOST DRAMATICALLY AFFECTED.

00:27:40.159 --> 00:27:43.629 region:rollup2
AS RENTS INCREASE ON THOSE WITH

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:46.365 region:rollup2
LIMITED INCOMES

00:27:43.629 --> 00:27:48.400 region:rollup2
QUALITY OF LIFE DECREASES IN

00:27:46.365 --> 00:27:50.002 region:rollup2
INVERSE PROPORTION DIRECTLY

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:52.905 region:rollup2
AFFECTING THEIR ABILITY TO PAY

00:27:50.002 --> 00:27:54.940 region:rollup2
FOR FOOD. UTILITIES MEDICATION

00:27:52.905 --> 00:27:57.409 region:rollup2
FUEL SCHOOL SUPPLIES AND OTHER

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:59.211 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALS.

00:27:57.409 --> 00:28:01.013 region:rollup2
FREQUENTLY IT EVENTUALLY LEADS

00:27:59.211 --> 00:28:03.148 region:rollup2
TO DISPLACEMENT.

00:28:01.013 --> 00:28:04.816 region:rollup2
PERHAPS TO COMMUNITY FAR AWAY

00:28:03.148 --> 00:28:06.251 region:rollup2
THAT REQUIRES LONG COMMUTES THAT

00:28:04.816 --> 00:28:08.287 region:rollup2
INCREASES TRAFFIC AND GREENHOUSE

00:28:06.251 --> 00:28:09.254 region:rollup2
GASES.

00:28:08.287 --> 00:28:10.389 region:rollup2
OR IT MAY MEAN TEMPORARY

00:28:09.254 --> 00:28:12.624 region:rollup2
QUARTERS ON A FRIEND OR

00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:14.293 region:rollup2
RELATIVE'S COUCH.

00:28:12.624 --> 00:28:14.893 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE ARE NO OTHER

00:28:14.293 --> 00:28:15.661 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE UNITS AVAILABLE FOR

00:28:14.893 --> 00:28:17.529 region:rollup2
RENT.

00:28:15.661 --> 00:28:19.731 region:rollup2
FOR MANY.

00:28:17.529 --> 00:28:22.034 region:rollup2
FAR TOO MANY THE NEXT STOP IS

00:28:19.731 --> 00:28:23.602 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS.

00:28:22.034 --> 00:28:25.370 region:rollup2
AND UNDOUBTEDLY WILL NOT THE

00:28:23.602 --> 00:28:27.139 region:rollup2
ONLY BECAUSE THE AFFORDABLE

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:28.840 region:rollup2
HOUSING CRISIS IS A SIGNIFICANT

00:28:27.139 --> 00:28:30.108 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTING BECAUSE OF THE

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:32.411 region:rollup2
DRAMATIC INCREASE IN

00:28:30.108 --> 00:28:34.413 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS. THAT WE HAVE SEEN

00:28:32.411 --> 00:28:35.881 region:rollup2
ACROSS CALIFORNIA.

00:28:34.413 --> 00:28:36.448 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OR MORE IN

00:28:35.881 --> 00:28:38.584 region:rollup2
MANY AREAS JUST IN THE PAST

00:28:36.448 --> 00:28:40.552 region:rollup2
YEAR.

00:28:38.584 --> 00:28:42.254 region:rollup2
I NEEDN'T REMIND YOU THAT

00:28:40.552 --> 00:28:44.456 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS NEARLY ONE

00:28:42.254 --> 00:28:46.725 region:rollup2
QUARTER THE NATION'S HOMELESS

00:28:44.456 --> 00:28:48.026 region:rollup2
AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN

00:28:46.725 --> 00:28:49.962 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND THAT'S UP FROM. ONE

00:28:48.026 --> 00:28:52.898 region:rollup2
FIFTH.

00:28:49.962 --> 00:28:54.233 region:rollup2
ONLY A FEW YEARS AGO.

00:28:52.898 --> 00:28:55.601 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT THE

00:28:54.233 --> 00:28:57.769 region:rollup2
STATE ARE STRUGGLING TO ADDRESS

00:28:55.601 --> 00:28:59.204 region:rollup2
THIS GROWING CRISIS.

00:28:57.769 --> 00:29:00.839 region:rollup2
THEY NEED ADDITIONAL TOOLS

00:28:59.204 --> 00:29:03.275 region:rollup2
CRAFTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO

00:29:00.839 --> 00:29:05.077 region:rollup2
HELP SLOW RAPIDLY INCREASING

00:29:03.275 --> 00:29:07.212 region:rollup2
RATS AND PROTECT RUNNERS WHO ARE

00:29:05.077 --> 00:29:08.914 region:rollup2
FACING DISPLACEMENT.

00:29:07.212 --> 00:29:10.148 region:rollup2
THIS IS CRITICAL NOT ONLY TO

00:29:08.914 --> 00:29:12.818 region:rollup2
PROTECTING FAMILIES FROM BEING

00:29:10.148 --> 00:29:14.653 region:rollup2
UPROOTED. BUT ALSO TO ENSURING

00:29:12.818 --> 00:29:15.320 region:rollup2
AN ADEQUATE LOCAL WORKFORCE.

00:29:14.653 --> 00:29:17.289 region:rollup2
AND MAINTAINING DIVERSE

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:19.224 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

00:29:17.289 --> 00:29:20.826 region:rollup2
CONTINUING TO PRICE EVERYDAY

00:29:19.224 --> 00:29:22.661 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS OUT OF THE HOUSING

00:29:20.826 --> 00:29:24.329 region:rollup2
MARKET.

00:29:22.661 --> 00:29:26.164 region:rollup2
WILL DAMAGE OUR ECONOMY HAS

00:29:24.329 --> 00:29:27.799 region:rollup2
COMPANIES FIND IT HARDER AND

00:29:26.164 --> 00:29:29.835 region:rollup2
HARDER TO RECRUIT TO RECRUIT

00:29:27.799 --> 00:29:31.403 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES.

00:29:29.835 --> 00:29:33.905 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENT CALIFORNIA HAVE

00:29:31.403 --> 00:29:35.007 region:rollup2
LOOKED TO RENT CONTROL.

00:29:33.905 --> 00:29:37.776 region:rollup2
AS ONE TOOL.

00:29:35.007 --> 00:29:40.012 region:rollup2
FOR HELPING.

00:29:37.776 --> 00:29:40.779 region:rollup2
NOW EVERY ADOPTED RENT CONTROL

00:29:40.012 --> 00:29:42.614 region:rollup2
ORDINANCE IN CALIFORNIA'S

00:29:40.779 --> 00:29:44.116 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WHY.

00:29:42.614 --> 00:29:46.084 region:rollup2
BECAUSE LONG BEFORE THE STATE

00:29:44.116 --> 00:29:47.452 region:rollup2
INTERCEDED IN THE MATTER LOCAL

00:29:46.084 --> 00:29:48.954 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS AND VOTERS WERE

00:29:47.452 --> 00:29:50.188 region:rollup2
CRAFTING ORDINANCES UNIQUELY

00:29:48.954 --> 00:29:52.257 region:rollup2
TAILORED TO THEIR LOCAL

00:29:50.188 --> 00:29:54.126 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS.

00:29:52.257 --> 00:29:55.827 region:rollup2
SOME PROVIDED FOR VACANCY DE

00:29:54.126 --> 00:29:57.562 region:rollup2

00:29:55.827 --> 00:30:00.232 region:rollup2
HAWKINS MANDATED.

00:29:57.562 --> 00:30:02.401 region:rollup2
MANY EXEMPTED NEW CONSTRUCTION.

00:30:00.232 --> 00:30:03.935 region:rollup2
ON THIS ISSUE I BELIEVE THE

00:30:02.401 --> 00:30:05.203 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND VOTERS

00:30:03.935 --> 00:30:07.372 region:rollup2
KNOW HOW TO BEST ADDRESS LOCAL

00:30:05.203 --> 00:30:09.508 region:rollup2
NEEDS.

00:30:07.372 --> 00:30:10.776 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE CURRENT CRISIS.

00:30:09.508 --> 00:30:12.077 region:rollup2
I THINK WE HAVE TO RETURN LOCAL

00:30:10.776 --> 00:30:15.814 region:rollup2
DECISION MAKING TO WHERE IT FITS

00:30:12.077 --> 00:30:18.517 region:rollup2
BEST AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

00:30:15.814 --> 00:30:19.985 region:rollup2
AGAIN AB FIFTEEN NO SIX SEEKS TO

00:30:18.517 --> 00:30:20.752 region:rollup2
HELP CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE

00:30:19.985 --> 00:30:22.621 region:rollup2
AFFECTED.

00:30:20.752 --> 00:30:24.556 region:rollup2
A DAY.

00:30:22.621 --> 00:30:26.792 region:rollup2
BY EXORBITANT AND UNAFFORDABLE

00:30:24.556 --> 00:30:27.893 region:rollup2
RENT INCREASES THAT THREATEN

00:30:26.792 --> 00:30:29.661 region:rollup2
THEM WITH DISPLACEMENT.

00:30:27.893 --> 00:30:32.364 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN QUALITY

00:30:29.661 --> 00:30:34.232 region:rollup2
OF LIFE. OR BOTH.

00:30:32.364 --> 00:30:36.468 region:rollup2
A FEW YEARS DOWN THE ROAD WHEN

00:30:34.232 --> 00:30:38.270 region:rollup2
WE HOPE EXPANDED HOP HOUSING

00:30:36.468 --> 00:30:40.138 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES TAKE HOLD.

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:42.741 region:rollup2
THAT WILL BE TOO LATE.

00:30:40.138 --> 00:30:43.909 region:rollup2
TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS.

00:30:42.741 --> 00:30:46.078 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS AN ISSUE FELLOW

00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:48.313 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THAT HAS YET TO

00:30:46.078 --> 00:30:50.982 region:rollup2
BE THE SUBJECT OF LEGISLATION OR

00:30:48.313 --> 00:30:53.185 region:rollup2
INDEED OF MUCH CONVERSATION

00:30:50.982 --> 00:30:55.187 region:rollup2
INTERNALLY HERE IN THE CAPITAL.

00:30:53.185 --> 00:30:56.688 region:rollup2
AND IT IS INDEED A DIFFICULT

00:30:55.187 --> 00:30:58.790 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AND I CERTAINLY

00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:59.825 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:02.427 region:rollup2
SURELY THAT WILL BE BE

00:30:59.825 --> 00:31:03.762 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATED BY TODAY'S HEARING.

00:31:02.427 --> 00:31:06.198 region:rollup2
BUT IT IS IN MY OPINION A

00:31:03.762 --> 00:31:08.400 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION THAT WE CAN NO

00:31:06.198 --> 00:31:10.035 region:rollup2
LONGER AVOID. AND PRESENTS AN

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.537 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT IS CRYING OUT FOR

00:31:10.035 --> 00:31:14.306 region:rollup2
RELIEF AND LEGISLATIVE ACTION.

00:31:12.537 --> 00:31:16.108 region:rollup2
OUR TEACHERS

00:31:14.306 --> 00:31:18.310 region:rollup2
GROCERY STORE WORKERS CAR

00:31:16.108 --> 00:31:20.512 region:rollup2
MECHANICS AND NURSES PEOPLE WHO

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:22.848 region:rollup2
WE INTERACT WITH. EACH AND EVERY

00:31:20.512 --> 00:31:24.216 region:rollup2
DAY MANY OF WHOM HAVE LIVED AND

00:31:22.848 --> 00:31:26.818 region:rollup2
WORKED IN OUR COMMUNITIES THEIR

00:31:24.216 --> 00:31:28.553 region:rollup2
ENTIRE LIVES AND MAKEUP.

00:31:26.818 --> 00:31:31.056 region:rollup2
FABRIC OF OUR COMMUNITIES.

00:31:28.553 --> 00:31:32.724 region:rollup2
ARE BEING PRICED OUT.

00:31:31.056 --> 00:31:34.326 region:rollup2
MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE

00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:36.061 region:rollup2
BARELY GETTING BY EACH MONTH

00:31:34.326 --> 00:31:37.696 region:rollup2
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE

00:31:36.061 --> 00:31:38.230 region:rollup2
TAKEN POSITIVE STEPS TO

00:31:37.696 --> 00:31:40.232 region:rollup2
ALLEVIATE THESE FINANCIAL

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:42.768 region:rollup2
STRESSES.

00:31:40.232 --> 00:31:45.504 region:rollup2
WHEN INCREASE MINIMUM WAGE.

00:31:42.768 --> 00:31:47.072 region:rollup2
INCREASED FUNDED CHILDCARE SLOTS

00:31:45.504 --> 00:31:49.875 region:rollup2
INVESTED IN THE EARNED INCOME

00:31:47.072 --> 00:31:51.877 region:rollup2
TAX CREDIT FOR WORKING FOR.

00:31:49.875 --> 00:31:53.945 region:rollup2
BUT ALL OF THESE GAINES INTENDED

00:31:51.877 --> 00:31:55.647 region:rollup2
TO IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE ARE

00:31:53.945 --> 00:31:57.115 region:rollup2
COMPROMISED

00:31:55.647 --> 00:31:59.618 region:rollup2
IF WE CAN'T CONTROL THE COST OF

00:31:57.115 --> 00:32:00.986 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

00:31:59.618 --> 00:32:02.854 region:rollup2
AB FIFTY KNOW SIX IS NOT A

00:32:00.986 --> 00:32:04.122 region:rollup2
SILVER BULLET THAT'S GOING AND

00:32:02.854 --> 00:32:06.258 region:rollup2
THE HOUSING CRISIS OVERNIGHT. I

00:32:04.122 --> 00:32:07.859 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THAT.

00:32:06.258 --> 00:32:09.428 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IS SIMPLY REMOVING A

00:32:07.859 --> 00:32:11.296 region:rollup2
BARRIER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

00:32:09.428 --> 00:32:13.198 region:rollup2
PRESERVE SOME AFFORDABILITY AND

00:32:11.296 --> 00:32:15.333 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOODS.

00:32:13.198 --> 00:32:17.669 region:rollup2
AND LET ME BE CLEAR.

00:32:15.333 --> 00:32:19.638 region:rollup2
REPEALING COSTA HAWKINS WILL NOT

00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:21.873 region:rollup2
LEAD OVERNIGHT TO RENT CONTROL

00:32:19.638 --> 00:32:23.241 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

00:32:21.873 --> 00:32:25.510 region:rollup2
WILL STILL HAVE TO PASS THEIR

00:32:23.241 --> 00:32:27.179 region:rollup2
OWN ORDINANCES TAILORED TO LOCAL

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:29.314 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS EITHER BY GOING TO

00:32:27.179 --> 00:32:31.183 region:rollup2
THE VOTERS ARE GOING THROUGH

00:32:29.314 --> 00:32:32.484 region:rollup2
THEIR COUNCIL OR BOARD.

00:32:31.183 --> 00:32:33.385 region:rollup2
SOME CITIES AND COUNTIES WILL

00:32:32.484 --> 00:32:34.853 region:rollup2
CHOOSE TO PURSUE RENT CONTROL

00:32:33.385 --> 00:32:36.521 region:rollup2
POLICIES

00:32:34.853 --> 00:32:37.989 region:rollup2
MANY AS HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST

00:32:36.521 --> 00:32:39.524 region:rollup2
WILL NOT.

00:32:37.989 --> 00:32:41.827 region:rollup2
NOT ALL JURISDICTIONS ARE READY

00:32:39.524 --> 00:32:43.395 region:rollup2
FOR RENT CONTROL WE HAVE RECENT

00:32:41.827 --> 00:32:45.797 region:rollup2
LOCAL ATTEMPTS IN SANTA ROSA

00:32:43.395 --> 00:32:48.366 region:rollup2
BURLINGAME AND ALAMEDA THAT.

00:32:45.797 --> 00:32:50.468 region:rollup2
WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL.

00:32:48.366 --> 00:32:53.505 region:rollup2
SO IN CONCLUSION THIS MEASURE IS

00:32:50.468 --> 00:32:55.774 region:rollup2
BUT ONE TOOL FOR THE LEGISLATURE

00:32:53.505 --> 00:32:58.476 region:rollup2
AND FOR OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES.

00:32:55.774 --> 00:33:00.378 region:rollup2
BUT IS THE ONLY ONE THAT WE HAVE

00:32:58.476 --> 00:33:02.781 region:rollup2
THAT CAN RIGHT NOW HELP OUR MOST

00:33:00.378 --> 00:33:04.583 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE.

00:33:02.781 --> 00:33:06.284 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I

00:33:04.583 --> 00:33:08.086 region:rollup2

IS A LOCAL CONTROL ISSUE.

00:33:41.486 --> 00:33:45.090 region:rollup2
REPEALING COSTA HAWKINS WILL NOT

00:33:42.787 --> 00:33:45.590 region:rollup2
RESULT IN RENT CONTROL STATEWIDE

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:47.359 region:rollup2
RENT CONTROL IS ALREADY

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:49.194 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE AND ONLY SIXTEEN

00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:50.495 region:rollup2
CITIES CURRENTLY HAVE ORDINANCES

00:33:49.194 --> 00:33:51.463 region:rollup2
ON THEIR BOOKS.

00:33:50.495 --> 00:33:52.998 region:rollup2
BUT IN THE AREAS WHERE THE

AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS IS

00:33:52.998 --> 00:33:56.635 region:rollup2
MOST ACUTE AND WHERE RENT

00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:58.169 region:rollup2
STABILIZATION HAS PROVEN

00:33:56.635 --> 00:34:00.572 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY TO PREVENT

DISPLACEMENT OF LOWER INCOME

ROBUST ECONOMY THESE AREAS THE

00:34:07.178 --> 00:34:10.248 region:rollup2
STATE SHOULD NOT MANDATE HOW

00:34:09.814 --> 00:34:12.484 region:rollup2
THOSE ORDINANCES ARE

00:34:10.248 --> 00:34:15.353 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED.

00:34:12.484 --> 00:34:17.188 region:rollup2
ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL.

00:34:15.353 --> 00:34:19.357 region:rollup2
AND ALSO THESE ORDINANCES ARE

00:34:17.188 --> 00:34:20.959 region:rollup2
EACH UNIQUE SOME OF THEM ALREADY

00:34:19.357 --> 00:34:23.562 region:rollup2

REALITIES IN THEIR AREAS. ALSO

UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. OF

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:35.707 region:rollup2
USING THE COST OF USING COSTA

00:34:34.306 --> 00:34:36.942 region:rollup2
HAWKINS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE

00:34:35.707 --> 00:34:39.210 region:rollup2
ELLIS ACT.

00:34:36.942 --> 00:34:41.980 region:rollup2
COSTA HAWKINS ALREADY CREATES A

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:44.282 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL INCENTIVE. TO FOR

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:46.051 region:rollup2
LANDLORDS TO A DRIVE EXISTING

00:34:44.282 --> 00:34:47.118 region:rollup2
TENANTS OUT OF THEIR UNITS SO

00:34:46.051 --> 00:34:48.853 region:rollup2
THAT THESE UNITS CAN BE RENTED

00:34:47.118 --> 00:34:50.455 region:rollup2
AT MARKET RATES.

00:34:48.853 --> 00:34:52.223 region:rollup2
WHEN USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH

00:34:50.455 --> 00:34:54.526 region:rollup2
THE ELLIS ACT IT'S COSTA HAWKINS

00:34:52.223 --> 00:34:56.294 region:rollup2
ON STEROIDS.

00:34:54.526 --> 00:34:58.730 region:rollup2
THE OTHER SIDE ALLOWS LANDLORDS

00:34:56.294 --> 00:35:00.899 region:rollup2
TO EMPTY ENTIRE BUILDINGS OF

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:03.268 region:rollup2
TENANTS. OSTENSIBLY TO LEAVE THE

00:35:00.899 --> 00:35:04.903 region:rollup2
RENTAL MARKET. BUT THE MEAGER

00:35:03.268 --> 00:35:07.472 region:rollup2
PENALTIES OF THE ALICE ACT ARE

00:35:04.903 --> 00:35:09.708 region:rollup2
DWARFED IN COMPARISON TO THE

00:35:07.472 --> 00:35:12.877 region:rollup2
PROFITS TO BE MADE WITH VACANCY

00:35:09.708 --> 00:35:14.946 region:rollup2
DE CONTROL UNDER COSTA HAWKINS.

00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:16.915 region:rollup2
THEREFORE WHEN USING CONJUNCTION

00:35:14.946 --> 00:35:18.917 region:rollup2
WITH THE ELLIS ACT COSTA HAWKINS

00:35:16.915 --> 00:35:21.119 region:rollup2
HAS LED TO THE PERVERSE

00:35:18.917 --> 00:35:24.289 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCE OF INCENTIVIZING

00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:25.624 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT AND ABUSE IN AREAS.

00:35:24.289 --> 00:35:27.993 region:rollup2
WHERE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:35:25.624 --> 00:35:30.128 region:rollup2
CRISIS IS MOST ACUTE?

00:35:27.993 --> 00:35:31.630 region:rollup2
FINALLY I WOULD JUST LIKE TO

00:35:30.128 --> 00:35:32.163 region:rollup2
POINT OUT LIKE SAKE THAT CITIES

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:33.898 region:rollup2
LIKE WEST HOLLYWOOD SANTA

00:35:32.163 --> 00:35:38.003 region:rollup2
MONICA.

00:35:33.898 --> 00:35:38.770 region:rollup2

00:35:38.003 --> 00:35:39.838 region:rollup2
MAY I FINISH MY STATE YOU CAN

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:41.806 region:rollup2
FINISH YOUR SENTENCE THINK WE

00:35:39.838 --> 00:35:43.174 region:rollup2
HAVE ALL STEPPED UP IN RESPONSE

00:35:41.806 --> 00:35:44.709 region:rollup2
TO THE STATE'S EVER INCREASING

00:35:43.174 --> 00:35:46.044 region:rollup2
DEMANDS.

00:35:44.709 --> 00:35:47.846 region:rollup2
TO INCREASE GREATER AND HAVE

00:35:46.044 --> 00:35:49.280 region:rollup2
GREATER AND DENSER DEVELOPMENT

00:35:47.846 --> 00:35:51.916 region:rollup2
THE STATE SHOULD NOT THEREFORE

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:53.785 region:rollup2
TIE THE CITY'S HANDS IN CRAFTING

00:35:51.916 --> 00:35:55.120 region:rollup2
EVEN MORE SOLUTIONS TO SOLVE

00:35:53.785 --> 00:35:56.988 region:rollup2
THIS CRISIS THANK YOU.

00:35:55.120 --> 00:36:00.091 region:rollup2

00:35:56.988 --> 00:36:00.892 region:rollup2
NEXT WITNESS PLACE.

00:36:00.091 --> 00:36:03.094 region:rollup2
THE MORNING MY NAME IS SHOULD

NAY FRANKLIN MINOR AND.

00:36:03.094 --> 00:36:06.297 region:rollup2
IVORY A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE

00:36:04.062 --> 00:36:08.299 region:rollup2
TODAY I SERVED AS AN APPOINTEE

00:36:06.297 --> 00:36:09.901 region:rollup2
UNDER GOVERNOR BROWN FOR THE

00:36:08.299 --> 00:36:11.536 region:rollup2
FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING COUNCIL.

00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:13.271 region:rollup2
AND I TRAVELED THE STATE HEARD

00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:15.006 region:rollup2
FROM MANY CALIFORNIANS ABOUT

00:36:13.271 --> 00:36:16.608 region:rollup2
THEIR FEAR OF DISPLACEMENT

00:36:15.006 --> 00:36:18.643 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE HOUSING CRISIS.

00:36:16.608 --> 00:36:20.412 region:rollup2
I ALSO UNDERSTAND PERSPECTIVE OF

00:36:18.643 --> 00:36:22.714 region:rollup2
A SMALL LANDLORD LIKE MY GRANNY

00:36:20.412 --> 00:36:26.618 region:rollup2
WHO WAS A SHARECROPPER SHE MOVED

00:36:22.714 --> 00:36:27.552 region:rollup2

MONEY CLEANING OTHER PEOPLE'S

00:36:29.854 --> 00:36:32.090 region:rollup2
HOUSES AND SHE RENTS IT OUT TO

00:36:31.489 --> 00:36:33.324 region:rollup2
SECTION EIGHT TENANTS TO GIVE

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:35.326 region:rollup2

BECOME A BIG PART OF THAT

00:36:49.774 --> 00:36:54.245 region:rollup2

THEY GIVE US A TWO MONTHS NOTICE

HERE IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE

00:41:10.902 --> 00:41:13.905 region:rollup2

THAT ARE THE LEGISLATURE AGREED

00:41:15.506 --> 00:41:18.977 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT BECAUSE AFTER TWENTY

00:41:17.308 --> 00:41:19.944 region:rollup2
YEARS OF EXTREME RIGHT

00:41:18.977 --> 00:41:22.246 region:rollup2
CONTROLLING R. LURKED LOCAL

00:41:19.944 --> 00:41:24.449 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS WE SAW WE HAD LOST

00:41:22.246 --> 00:41:25.316 region:rollup2
A LOT OF HOUSING. WE SAW THAT WE

00:41:24.449 --> 00:41:27.018 region:rollup2
HAD LOST.

00:41:25.316 --> 00:41:28.453 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO HAD MOVED.

JURISDICTIONS GENTRIFICATION

00:41:30.788 --> 00:41:34.525 region:rollup2
AND NEW CONSTRUCTION HAD COME TO

00:41:33.157 --> 00:41:36.094 region:rollup2
A NEAR HALT.

00:41:34.525 --> 00:41:37.829 region:rollup2
TODAY HOUSING PRICES ARE NOT

00:41:36.094 --> 00:41:39.297 region:rollup2
INCREASING BECAUSE OF COSTA

00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:39.964 region:rollup2
HAWKINS ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY WE

00:41:39.297 --> 00:41:41.799 region:rollup2
AGREE.

00:41:39.964 --> 00:41:43.534 region:rollup2
WITH THE PROPONENTS HERE THAT

00:41:41.799 --> 00:41:45.303 region:rollup2
HOUSING PRICES ARE INCREASING

00:41:43.534 --> 00:41:47.472 region:rollup2
BUT I WILL SAY IT'S BECAUSE.

00:41:45.303 --> 00:41:49.374 region:rollup2
WE HAVE NOT DONE OUR JOBS AT

00:41:47.472 --> 00:41:51.209 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL JURISDICTION I HAVE TO

00:41:49.374 --> 00:41:52.577 region:rollup2
COMMEND THIS BODY YOU HAVE DONE

00:41:51.209 --> 00:41:54.312 region:rollup2
GREAT WORK.

00:41:52.577 --> 00:41:56.247 region:rollup2
WITH THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN

00:41:54.312 --> 00:41:56.748 region:rollup2
THE HOUSING PACKAGE AND I THINK

00:41:56.247 --> 00:41:57.849 region:rollup2
THAT'S GONNA MAKE A HUGE

00:41:56.748 --> 00:41:59.417 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE.

00:41:57.849 --> 00:42:00.752 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY THE PROBLEM WE

00:41:59.417 --> 00:42:02.820 region:rollup2
FACE IS THAT WE BELIEVE COSTA

00:42:00.752 --> 00:42:03.421 region:rollup2
HAWKINS WILL PUT A HALT ALL THE

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:04.856 region:rollup2
GREAT WORK THAT YOU'VE ALREADY

00:42:03.421 --> 00:42:06.891 region:rollup2
DONE.

00:42:04.856 --> 00:42:07.892 region:rollup2
I'M IN RECENT REPORTS THE STATE

00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:09.093 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST CONCLUDED

00:42:07.892 --> 00:42:11.863 region:rollup2
THAT RENT CONTROL WILL DO

00:42:09.093 --> 00:42:14.232 region:rollup2
NOTHING. TO INCREASE OUR SUPPLY

00:42:11.863 --> 00:42:15.800 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT WILL DISCOURAGE NEW

00:42:14.232 --> 00:42:17.535 region:rollup2
HOUSING CONSTRUCTION AND WHILE

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.670 region:rollup2
IN THE BAY AREA YOU SEE CRANES

00:42:17.535 --> 00:42:21.672 region:rollup2
IN THE AIR EVERY DAY. IN FACT WE

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:23.141 region:rollup2
HAVE ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND NEW

00:42:21.672 --> 00:42:24.742 region:rollup2
HOUSING UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:42:23.141 --> 00:42:26.277 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTED IN THE PAST YEARS.

00:42:24.742 --> 00:42:27.812 region:rollup2
THAT SEEMS LIKE A BOOM INTO YOUR

00:42:26.277 --> 00:42:29.680 region:rollup2
REALIZE THAT WE CREATED SEVENTY

00:42:27.812 --> 00:42:31.883 region:rollup2
FIVE THOUSAND NEW JOBS AT THE

YOU KNOW THE HOUSING COMMITTEE

00:42:40.057 --> 00:42:43.494 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT AB

00:42:41.692 --> 00:42:44.495 region:rollup2

00:42:46.064 --> 00:42:48.866 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T.

THEY WILL ADOPT MORE EXTREME

00:42:51.669 --> 00:42:54.539 region:rollup2
FORMS OF RENT CONTROL. THE

00:42:53.304 --> 00:42:56.441 region:rollup2

YOU ARE ALSO CORRECT THAT THE

00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:07.452 region:rollup2

THEY HAVE LEFT THE MARKET AND

WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT AGAIN.

00:43:12.857 --> 00:43:16.427 region:rollup2

PREVIOUSLY STATED.

00:46:10.968 --> 00:46:14.138 region:rollup2
IT'S MURDER MEMBERS OF THE

COSTA HAWKINS RENTAL HOUSING ACT

00:46:14.138 --> 00:46:16.974 region:rollup2
WAS A BIPARTISAN COMPROMISE A

00:46:15.573 --> 00:46:18.442 region:rollup2
REACHED BY A BROAD SPECTRUM OF

00:46:16.974 --> 00:46:19.744 region:rollup2

AB FIFTEEN NO SIX SEEKS TO UNDO

00:46:21.879 --> 00:46:25.516 region:rollup2
THIS LONGSTANDING LAW BY

00:46:24.315 --> 00:46:26.350 region:rollup2
REPEALING IT IN ITS ENTIRETY.

00:46:25.516 --> 00:46:28.119 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WOULD DISCOURAGE THE

00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:29.754 region:rollup2
CREATION OF RENTAL HOUSING AND

00:46:28.119 --> 00:46:31.188 region:rollup2
IMPAIR HOUSING AFFORDABILITY.

00:46:29.754 --> 00:46:32.890 region:rollup2
WHICH IS ANTITHETICAL TO THE

00:46:31.188 --> 00:46:34.525 region:rollup2
STATED GOAL OF THE BILL.

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:35.626 region:rollup2
NEEDLESS TO SAY CA OUR

00:46:34.525 --> 00:46:36.560 region:rollup2
CONTINUES TO BE A MAJOR

00:46:35.626 --> 00:46:38.162 region:rollup2
PROPONENT OF AFFORDABLE

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:39.530 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE HOUSING AND SUPPORTED

00:46:38.162 --> 00:46:40.164 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE BILL'S CONTAINED IN

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:41.499 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR'S LEGISLATIVE HOUSING

00:46:40.164 --> 00:46:42.967 region:rollup2
PACKAGE.

00:46:41.499 --> 00:46:44.235 region:rollup2
THOSE MEASURES ADDRESSED THE

00:46:42.967 --> 00:46:45.603 region:rollup2
TWO MAIN FACETS OF THE

00:46:44.235 --> 00:46:47.371 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS.

00:46:45.603 --> 00:46:48.673 region:rollup2
WHICH OR THE LACK OF FUNDING

00:46:47.371 --> 00:46:50.274 region:rollup2
AND THE LACK OF SUPPLY

00:46:48.673 --> 00:46:51.309 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY THE SUCCESSFUL

00:46:50.274 --> 00:46:53.044 region:rollup2
PASSAGE OF MANY OF THOSE

00:46:51.309 --> 00:46:54.378 region:rollup2
MEASURES. CAN BE ATTRIBUTED.

00:46:53.044 --> 00:46:55.646 region:rollup2
AND WAS ACHIEVED THROUGH

00:46:54.378 --> 00:46:56.380 region:rollup2
COMPROMISE IN BRINGING HOUSING

00:46:55.646 --> 00:46:58.416 region:rollup2
ADVOCATES TOGETHER FROM ALL

00:46:56.380 --> 00:47:00.384 region:rollup2
SIDES.

00:46:58.416 --> 00:47:01.886 region:rollup2
AND SEE OUR FEELS AS THOUGH.

00:47:00.384 --> 00:47:03.854 region:rollup2
WILD HOUSING PACKAGE WAS

00:47:01.886 --> 00:47:05.089 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL WE FEEL AS THOUGH WE

00:47:03.854 --> 00:47:06.390 region:rollup2
TOOK TWO STEPS FORWARD WITH

00:47:05.089 --> 00:47:07.625 region:rollup2
RESPECT THAT HOUSING PACKAGE IN

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:09.160 region:rollup2
TERMS OF HELPING TO ALLEVIATE

00:47:07.625 --> 00:47:10.828 region:rollup2
THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS.

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:11.996 region:rollup2
BUT NOW WITH AB FIFTEEN NO SIX

00:47:10.828 --> 00:47:13.064 region:rollup2
WE FEEL IS THAT WE'RE TAKING A

00:47:11.996 --> 00:47:14.732 region:rollup2
STEP BACKWARDS.

00:47:13.064 --> 00:47:16.100 region:rollup2
AND THE REASON WHY I SAY THAT

00:47:14.732 --> 00:47:17.501 region:rollup2
IS BECAUSE AB FIFTEEN OF SIX

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:19.704 region:rollup2
NEITHER ADDRESSES THE LACK OF

00:47:17.501 --> 00:47:21.205 region:rollup2
FUNDING NOR THE LACK OF SUPPLY

00:47:19.704 --> 00:47:22.606 region:rollup2
AND TO THE CONTRARY WOULD

00:47:21.205 --> 00:47:24.075 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY DIMINISH EXISTING

00:47:22.606 --> 00:47:25.543 region:rollup2
RENTAL HOUSING STOCK. AND

00:47:24.075 --> 00:47:26.877 region:rollup2
NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE

00:47:25.543 --> 00:47:28.179 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT OF NEW HOUSING

00:47:26.877 --> 00:47:29.213 region:rollup2

00:48:01.212 --> 00:48:03.748 region:rollup2
PALM THINK YOU MISTER BLOOM FOR

00:48:02.513 --> 00:48:05.316 region:rollup2
BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I DO

00:48:03.748 --> 00:48:07.485 region:rollup2
HAVE A QUESTION I I AM NEW TO

00:48:05.316 --> 00:48:08.986 region:rollup2
THIS COMMITTEE. SO I'M NOT

00:48:07.485 --> 00:48:09.620 region:rollup2
FAMILIAR WITH THE ELLIS ACT

00:48:08.986 --> 00:48:13.357 region:rollup2
SO.

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:14.925 region:rollup2
IS AT A STATE ACT A FEDERAL ACT.

00:48:13.357 --> 00:48:16.360 region:rollup2
AND WHY IS THAT NOT UNDER

00:48:14.925 --> 00:48:19.063 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION FOR POTENTIAL

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:22.066 region:rollup2
REFORM AS WELL.

00:48:19.063 --> 00:48:23.234 region:rollup2
ALAS. ALAS MS REAGAN TO ADDRESS

00:48:22.066 --> 00:48:23.801 region:rollup2
THAT QUESTION IF THAT'S ALRIGHT

00:48:23.234 --> 00:48:24.101 region:rollup2
WITH YOU AND WELCOME TO THE

00:48:23.801 --> 00:48:26.170 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE.

00:48:24.101 --> 00:48:27.805 region:rollup2
THANK YOU

00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:29.407 region:rollup2
SO VOTE FROM THE OUTSIDE IS A

00:48:27.805 --> 00:48:30.608 region:rollup2
STATE LAW IT WAS ENACTED IN

00:48:29.407 --> 00:48:32.042 region:rollup2
NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX.

00:48:30.608 --> 00:48:33.043 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS IN RESPONSE TO A

00:48:32.042 --> 00:48:34.645 region:rollup2
SUPREME COURT CASE WHICH

00:48:33.043 --> 00:48:35.913 region:rollup2
PROHIBITED LANDLORDS FROM

00:48:34.645 --> 00:48:38.048 region:rollup2
EXITING THE RENTAL MARKET SO IT

00:48:35.913 --> 00:48:38.582 region:rollup2
WAS DESIGNED TO ALLOW LANDLORDS

00:48:38.048 --> 00:48:40.050 region:rollup2
WHO NO LONGER WANTED TO BE

00:48:38.582 --> 00:48:41.752 region:rollup2
LANDLORDS.

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:43.654 region:rollup2
TO PEGS AT THE RENTAL MARKET THE

00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:46.490 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IS IS WHEN COSTA HAWKINS

00:48:43.654 --> 00:48:48.292 region:rollup2
WAS PASSED LATER IT THEN CREATED

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:50.060 region:rollup2
THIS THAT AND AS RENTS HAVE

00:48:48.292 --> 00:48:51.962 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO SKYROCKET TO WHERE

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:54.031 region:rollup2
THEY ARE TODAY. IT'S WHEN IT'S

00:48:51.962 --> 00:48:55.166 region:rollup2
USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH ELLIS

00:48:54.031 --> 00:48:56.667 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHY THE REPEAL OF

00:48:55.166 --> 00:48:59.136 region:rollup2
COSTA HAWKINS IS IMPORTANT IS

00:48:56.667 --> 00:49:01.071 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ELLIS ITSELF IS NOT SO

00:48:59.136 --> 00:49:04.074 region:rollup2
PROBLEMATIC BUT IT CREATES THIS

00:49:01.071 --> 00:49:06.410 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE. TO DRIVE TENANTS OUT

00:49:04.074 --> 00:49:07.678 region:rollup2
OF ENTIRE BUILDINGS SO THAT THEN

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:09.580 region:rollup2
THE LANDLORD CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE

00:49:07.678 --> 00:49:11.382 region:rollup2
OF THE ABILITY TO REROUTE THOSE

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:13.350 region:rollup2
UNITS AT MARKET RATES. AND THE

00:49:11.382 --> 00:49:15.619 region:rollup2
ELLIS ACT DOES PROVIDE PENALTIES

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:17.822 region:rollup2
FOR DOING SO BUT THOSE PENALTIES

00:49:15.619 --> 00:49:20.224 region:rollup2
ARE SO MEAGER. THAT THE PROFITS

00:49:17.822 --> 00:49:22.193 region:rollup2
TO BE MADE ENCOURAGE LANDLORDS

00:49:20.224 --> 00:49:23.561 region:rollup2
TO ABUSE BOTH OF THESE LAWS AND

00:49:22.193 --> 00:49:28.599 region:rollup2
THEREFORE REDUCES THE AFFORDABLE

00:49:23.561 --> 00:49:30.634 region:rollup2
HOUSING SUPPLY DRASTICALLY.

00:49:28.599 --> 00:49:31.635 region:rollup2
THE OPPOSITION HAVE A UNIQUE.

00:49:30.634 --> 00:49:32.236 region:rollup2
I THINK THE ONLY THING I WOULD

00:49:31.635 --> 00:49:33.604 region:rollup2
ADD THE ELLIS ACT DOES ALLOW

00:49:32.236 --> 00:49:35.005 region:rollup2
RENTAL PROPERTIES TO GO OUT OF

00:49:33.604 --> 00:49:36.407 region:rollup2
BUSINESS BUT YOU CANNOT RE

00:49:35.005 --> 00:49:37.975 region:rollup2
RANCHER UNITS THERE ARE

00:49:36.407 --> 00:49:39.643 region:rollup2
PENALTIES FOR DOING SO IN OF

00:49:37.975 --> 00:49:40.578 region:rollup2
CITIES ARE ENFORCING THOSE. I

00:49:39.643 --> 00:49:42.880 region:rollup2
WOULD TURN TO THE CITY AND SAY

00:49:40.578 --> 00:49:44.849 region:rollup2
WHY ARE YOU ENFORCING THOSE LAWS

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:46.617 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO GO OUT OF THE RENTAL

00:49:44.849 --> 00:49:47.685 region:rollup2
HOUSING BUSINESS YOU HAVE TO

00:49:46.617 --> 00:49:50.187 region:rollup2
CONVERT IT TO YOUR OWNER

00:49:47.685 --> 00:49:52.556 region:rollup2
OCCUPIED OR NOT. I USE IT AT ALL

00:49:50.187 --> 00:49:54.158 region:rollup2
SO THOSE ARE THE ONLY ALLOWANCES

00:49:52.556 --> 00:49:56.994 region:rollup2
IF YOU DECIDE TO TAKE YOUR

00:49:54.158 --> 00:49:59.096 region:rollup2
RENTAL UNIT OFF OF THE MARKET.

00:49:56.994 --> 00:49:59.663 region:rollup2
I'M.

00:49:59.096 --> 00:50:02.132 region:rollup2
NO THE QUESTION THAT JUST A

00:49:59.663 --> 00:50:02.933 region:rollup2
QUESTION I'M.

00:50:02.132 --> 00:50:04.335 region:rollup2
QUITE FRANKLY I AM NOT USE TO

00:50:02.933 --> 00:50:05.803 region:rollup2
SEEING A BILL THAT HAS BASICALLY

00:50:04.335 --> 00:50:06.637 region:rollup2
JUST ONE LINE.

00:53:20.898 --> 00:53:24.301 region:rollup2
ADVANCED WITH NO DATA TO SUPPORT

00:53:22.533 --> 00:53:25.803 region:rollup2
IT WHATSOEVER THAT THE

00:53:24.301 --> 00:53:27.404 region:rollup2
IMPOSITION OF RENT CONTROL AND A

00:53:25.803 --> 00:53:29.473 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY WILL LEAD. TO.

00:53:27.404 --> 00:53:33.177 region:rollup2
NO NEW CONSTRUCTION OR

00:53:29.473 --> 00:53:34.011 region:rollup2
DETERRENCE CUT TO CONSTRUCTION

00:53:33.177 --> 00:53:35.846 region:rollup2
THESE ARE THE SAME ARGUMENTS

00:53:34.011 --> 00:53:38.315 region:rollup2
THAT ARE MADE EVERY TIME AGAINST

00:53:35.846 --> 00:53:45.155 region:rollup2
RENT CONTROL BEFORE CITY ADOPT

00:53:38.315 --> 00:53:45.155 region:rollup2
SENT. AND IT DOES NOT PAN OUT TO

00:53:45.222 --> 00:53:50.561 region:rollup2
FACTORS THAT GO INTO WHETHER

00:53:47.458 --> 00:53:51.929 region:rollup2
HOUSING GETS BUILT OBVIOUSLY

00:53:50.561 --> 00:53:53.063 region:rollup2
INCLUDING WHAT INTEREST RATES

00:53:51.929 --> 00:53:58.168 region:rollup2
ARE.

00:53:53.063 --> 00:54:01.338 region:rollup2
MATERIALS COST ZONING LAWS ON

00:53:58.168 --> 00:54:03.907 region:rollup2
AND THE INDUSTRY UNDERSTANDABLY

00:54:01.338 --> 00:54:06.944 region:rollup2
POINTS TO RENT CONTROL.

00:54:03.907 --> 00:54:10.747 region:rollup2
AS A DETERRENT TO HOUSING I

00:54:06.944 --> 00:54:14.017 region:rollup2
WANTED TO JUST IN RESPONSE THE

00:54:10.747 --> 00:54:15.686 region:rollup2
FOCUS THERE HAVE BEEN SPECIFIC

00:54:14.017 --> 00:54:21.225 region:rollup2
STUDIES.

00:54:15.686 --> 00:54:24.027 region:rollup2
THAT THAT SUPPORT THE POSITION

00:54:21.225 --> 00:54:24.661 region:rollup2
THAT NOT ONLY IS RANKED OWN NOT

00:54:24.027 --> 00:54:33.137 region:rollup2
TO TURN CONSTRUCTION WHO ARE FOR

00:54:24.661 --> 00:54:35.506 region:rollup2
THE CITY OF LOS

00:54:33.137 --> 00:54:36.840 region:rollup2
ANGELES THAT ESTABLISHED THE

00:54:35.506 --> 00:54:38.242 region:rollup2
RENT CONTROL DID NOT ADVERSELY.

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:39.409 region:rollup2
IMPACT THE CONSTRUCTION OF

00:54:38.242 --> 00:54:41.545 region:rollup2
RENTAL HOUSING.

00:54:39.409 --> 00:54:43.413 region:rollup2
THERE WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY

00:54:41.545 --> 00:54:44.548 region:rollup2
ONE STUDY BY APPLE BAND THAT WAS

00:54:43.413 --> 00:54:45.682 region:rollup2
PREPARED FOR THE SENATE RULES

00:54:44.548 --> 00:54:47.885 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE.

00:54:45.682 --> 00:54:50.187 region:rollup2
THAT ESTABLISHED NOT ONLY THAT

00:54:47.885 --> 00:54:51.989 region:rollup2
RENT CONTROL PRIMARILY BENEFITS

00:54:50.187 --> 00:54:54.024 region:rollup2
A LITTLE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WHICH

00:54:51.989 --> 00:54:55.092 region:rollup2
WE ALL KNOW UP BUT ALSO THAT IT

00:54:54.024 --> 00:54:58.128 region:rollup2
DID NOT DSCOURAGE THE

00:54:55.092 --> 00:55:00.931 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION OF OF NEW HOUSING.

00:54:58.128 --> 00:55:03.333 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT THAT BERKELEY AND

00:55:00.931 --> 00:55:04.668 region:rollup2
SANTA MONICA TO CITIES THAT HAD

00:55:03.333 --> 00:55:06.470 region:rollup2
STRICT.

00:55:04.668 --> 00:55:09.606 region:rollup2
RENT CONTROL WITH VACANCY

00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:11.208 region:rollup2
CONTROL PROVISIONS ACTUALLY DID

00:55:09.606 --> 00:55:14.344 region:rollup2
BETTER THAN OTHERS.

00:55:11.208 --> 00:55:16.880 region:rollup2
CITIES ON AND STOOD OUT FOR

00:55:14.344 --> 00:55:19.883 region:rollup2
THEIR PRODUCTION AUTHORED WHAT'S

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:21.818 region:rollup2
IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX THE

00:55:19.883 --> 00:55:23.720 region:rollup2
BERKELEY RAMP OR COMMISSIONED A

00:55:21.818 --> 00:55:25.856 region:rollup2
STUDY LOOKING AT NINETEEN NINETY

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:27.958 region:rollup2
SIX TO TWO THOUSAND FIVE

00:55:25.856 --> 00:55:29.726 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION. AYE AND FOUND A

00:55:27.958 --> 00:55:34.865 region:rollup2
HIGHER PRODUCTION.

00:55:29.726 --> 00:55:36.934 region:rollup2
OF HOUSING PER CAPITA IN RENT

00:55:34.865 --> 00:55:39.002 region:rollup2
CONTROL CITIES WHEN THEY STUDIED

00:55:36.934 --> 00:55:42.239 region:rollup2
ALL THE BAY AREA CITIES AND MOST

00:55:39.002 --> 00:55:46.410 region:rollup2
RECENTLY JUST LAST YEAR OF THE

00:55:42.239 --> 00:55:49.780 region:rollup2
HAAS INSTITUTE I ISSUED A STUDY.

00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:50.380 region:rollup2
AND THEY SAID AYE AYE QUOTE

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:58.322 region:rollup2
WHEN WE LOOK AT HOUSING TRYING

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:59.990 region:rollup2
TO HALT A PRODUCTION.

00:55:58.322 --> 00:56:01.458 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU AND THEN I ALSO ONE

00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:02.559 region:rollup2
OF THE ISSUES THAT HAS NOT

00:56:01.458 --> 00:56:04.394 region:rollup2
REALLY BEEN RAISED BUT I BUT I

00:56:02.559 --> 00:56:05.662 region:rollup2
KNOW IS THE KEY ISSUE. IS THE

00:56:04.394 --> 00:56:07.831 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE.

00:56:05.662 --> 00:56:09.199 region:rollup2
ECONOMICS AND I THINK MOST

00:56:07.831 --> 00:56:10.500 region:rollup2
ECONOMISTS FEEL THE RENT CONTROL

00:56:09.199 --> 00:56:12.069 region:rollup2
IS A BIT OF A CHALLENGE OF

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:14.171 region:rollup2
COURSE A LOT OF WHAT WE DO IS

00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:15.305 region:rollup2
NOT.

00:56:14.171 --> 00:56:16.440 region:rollup2
STRICTLY BY THE BOOK WITH

00:56:15.305 --> 00:56:17.374 region:rollup2
RESPECT TO WHAT ECONOMISTS WANT

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:19.543 region:rollup2
OR DON'T WANT.

00:56:17.374 --> 00:56:21.378 region:rollup2
OUR ENTIRE TAX SYSTEM.

00:56:19.543 --> 00:56:22.880 region:rollup2
WHAT DOES NOT MAKE MUCH ECONOMIC

00:56:21.378 --> 00:56:24.147 region:rollup2
SENSE AND SO FOR US AGAIN THERE

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:25.716 region:rollup2
THERE ARE TRADE OFFS WHEN WE'RE

00:56:24.147 --> 00:56:28.218 region:rollup2
DOING SOMETHING AND I DON'T

00:56:25.716 --> 00:56:29.519 region:rollup2
DISAGREE? WITH THE ANALYSES OF

00:56:28.218 --> 00:56:32.389 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT THAT GREAT CONTROL

00:56:29.519 --> 00:56:33.957 region:rollup2
DOES HAVE ON THE ECONOMY BUT YET

00:56:32.389 --> 00:56:34.391 region:rollup2
WE'RE WE'RE PLAYING WITH AN

00:56:33.957 --> 00:56:36.760 region:rollup2
ECONOMY THAT IS SURE

00:56:34.391 --> 00:56:38.395 region:rollup2
SO.

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.663 region:rollup2
HAS PROGRESSED SO FAR IN ONE

00:56:38.395 --> 00:56:41.765 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR DIRECTION THAT

00:56:39.663 --> 00:56:43.901 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES IT IS UP TO GOVERNMENT

00:56:41.765 --> 00:56:45.736 region:rollup2
PROVIDE SOME BALANCE IN IN THE

00:56:43.901 --> 00:56:47.471 region:rollup2
RAIN THAT IT SO PERHAPS YOU

00:56:45.736 --> 00:56:48.939 region:rollup2
COULD COMMENT ON. THAT THE

00:56:47.471 --> 00:56:49.907 region:rollup2
ECONOMICS OF IT BUT COURSE.

00:56:48.939 --> 00:56:51.275 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S A LITTLE BIT HEAVILY

00:56:49.907 --> 00:56:53.610 region:rollup2
LOADED BECAUSE ALL WE'RE DOING

00:56:51.275 --> 00:56:54.578 region:rollup2
IS APPEALING COSTA HAWKINS.

00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:55.979 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

00:56:54.578 --> 00:56:57.748 region:rollup2
ARE GONNA HAVE TO DO THEIR OWN

00:56:55.979 --> 00:56:59.950 region:rollup2
ECONOMICANALYSIS ABOUT WHAT

00:56:57.748 --> 00:57:01.885 region:rollup2
THAT IMPACT IS VERSES THEIR

00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:03.887 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR RENTAL MARKET. WHAT

00:57:01.885 --> 00:57:04.755 region:rollup2
THEIR DEMOGRAPHICS ARE WHAT

00:57:03.887 --> 00:57:05.188 region:rollup2
THEIR SUPPLIES ARE WITH THEIR

00:57:04.755 --> 00:57:08.058 region:rollup2
DEMANDS ARE SO IT'S

00:57:05.188 --> 00:57:09.426 region:rollup2
IT'S?

00:57:08.058 --> 00:57:10.894 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY EASY THING

00:57:09.426 --> 00:57:12.562 region:rollup2
TO ANSWER BUT I JUST

00:57:10.894 --> 00:57:14.865 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR A COMMENT ON HOW WE

00:57:12.562 --> 00:57:15.866 region:rollup2
BALANCE THE THE ECONOMIC FOR THE

00:57:14.865 --> 00:57:18.168 region:rollup2
BALLOT ECONOMIC CRITICISMS.

00:57:15.866 --> 00:57:20.170 region:rollup2
OF.

00:57:18.168 --> 00:57:22.372 region:rollup2
WHAT RATE CONTROL DOES VERSUS

00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:22.873 region:rollup2
OPENING THIS UP TO JURISDICTIONS

00:57:22.372 --> 00:57:25.342 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT

00:57:22.873 --> 00:57:26.443 region:rollup2
DECISION?

00:57:25.342 --> 00:57:29.079 region:rollup2
I'LL JUST MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT I

00:57:26.443 --> 00:57:30.914 region:rollup2
THINK REPEALING COSTA HAWKINS.

00:57:29.079 --> 00:57:32.916 region:rollup2
ALLOWING

00:57:30.914 --> 00:57:35.452 region:rollup2
THE INDIVIDUAL CITIES TO ADDRESS

00:57:32.916 --> 00:57:36.687 region:rollup2
THEIR PARTICULAR ECONOMIC NEEDS

00:57:35.452 --> 00:57:38.322 region:rollup2
IS THE BALANCE THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:57:36.687 --> 00:57:40.891 region:rollup2
STRUCK

00:57:38.322 --> 00:57:42.159 region:rollup2
SO IT'S WELL DOCUMENTED THAT

00:57:40.891 --> 00:57:43.794 region:rollup2
AREAS THAT ARE HARDEST HIT BY

00:57:42.159 --> 00:57:45.595 region:rollup2
THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS

00:57:43.794 --> 00:57:46.763 region:rollup2
WHERE. FAMILIES ARE BEING

00:57:45.595 --> 00:57:47.631 region:rollup2
DISPLACED THEY'RE MOVING ON NOT

00:57:46.763 --> 00:57:48.799 region:rollup2
ONLY OUT OF THE CITIES AND

00:57:47.631 --> 00:57:50.600 region:rollup2
COUNTIES AND SOMETIMES OUT OF

00:57:48.799 --> 00:57:52.736 region:rollup2
THE REGION. THAT HARMS THESE

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:53.937 region:rollup2
AREAS ECONOMICALLY IT ALSO HARMS

00:57:52.736 --> 00:57:55.605 region:rollup2
USERS ECONOMICALLY WHEN PEOPLE

00:57:53.937 --> 00:57:57.040 region:rollup2
CAN'T LIVE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO

00:57:55.605 --> 00:57:58.175 region:rollup2
LIVE CLOSE TO WHERE THEY WORK

00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.776 region:rollup2
THEY CAN'T BE PART OF THAT

00:57:58.175 --> 00:58:02.212 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY. THAT'S A WELL

00:57:59.776 --> 00:58:05.582 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTED ECONOMIC HARDSHIP

00:58:02.212 --> 00:58:08.318 region:rollup2
SO ALLOWING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

00:58:05.582 --> 00:58:10.253 region:rollup2
TO GOVERN TO DECIDE WHAT

00:58:08.318 --> 00:58:11.621 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS ARE BASS BY NOT TAKING

00:58:10.253 --> 00:58:13.090 region:rollup2
AWAY ALL OF THE TOOLS IN THEIR

00:58:11.621 --> 00:58:13.890 region:rollup2
TOOL BOX.

00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:17.694 region:rollup2
THAT WILL EASE THAT ECONOMIC

00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:18.929 region:rollup2
STRESS.

00:58:17.694 --> 00:58:20.330 region:rollup2
THANK YOU A SHOULD I NAY FROM

00:58:18.929 --> 00:58:22.065 region:rollup2
WEST HOLLYWOOD BUT. BECAUSE THE

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:23.967 region:rollup2
BAY AREA WHERE THE ECONOMY IS

00:58:22.065 --> 00:58:26.903 region:rollup2
BOOMING BY. HOUSING CRISIS IS

00:58:23.967 --> 00:58:29.406 region:rollup2
VERY VERY REAL AND IN THE MIDDLE

00:58:26.903 --> 00:58:31.975 region:rollup2
OF THAT ECONOMIC BOOM THE

00:58:29.406 --> 00:58:34.311 region:rollup2
UNDERLYING. ECONOMIC LOSS FOR

00:58:31.975 --> 00:58:36.346 region:rollup2
VARIOUS STRAT OF OUR SOCIETY IS

00:58:34.311 --> 00:58:36.913 region:rollup2
REALLY CRITICAL

00:58:36.346 --> 00:58:39.883 region:rollup2
THAT THEY AREAS TO SUCH A

00:58:36.913 --> 00:58:42.085 region:rollup2
DICHOTOMY OF OF WIN AND LOSE

00:58:39.883 --> 00:58:43.120 region:rollup2
RIGHT IN THE SAME AREAS THAT.

00:58:42.085 --> 00:58:45.022 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY VERY DIFFICULT

00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:46.823 region:rollup2
PROBLEM AT AT ASSEMBLYMEMBER WE

00:58:45.022 --> 00:58:49.493 region:rollup2
WE SEE THAT SAME DYNAMIC IN WEST

00:58:46.823 --> 00:58:50.794 region:rollup2
HOLLYWOOD AND IN SANTA MONICA.

00:58:49.493 --> 00:58:53.230 region:rollup2
IN WEST LOS ANGELES.

00:58:50.794 --> 00:58:55.165 region:rollup2
IN MY DISTRICT.

00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:56.433 region:rollup2
SO I THINK WE ACTUALLY TRY

00:58:55.165 --> 00:58:58.035 region:rollup2
SIERRA FORTUNATELY WE SHARE.

00:58:56.433 --> 00:59:00.270 region:rollup2
THE SAME THE SAME ISSUES.

00:58:58.035 --> 00:59:01.171 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:02.205 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER STONE LET'S

00:59:01.171 --> 00:59:03.940 region:rollup2
TURN IT OVER TO OUR VICE CHAIR

00:59:02.205 --> 00:59:04.875 region:rollup2
MISTER STEINORTH.

00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:06.243 region:rollup2
AND THANK YOU FOR THE OFFER

00:59:04.875 --> 00:59:08.011 region:rollup2
BRING THIS BILL FORD I THINK IS

00:59:06.243 --> 00:59:09.613 region:rollup2
A DISCUSSION THAT. HAS BEEN.

00:59:08.011 --> 00:59:10.981 region:rollup2
DISKS REALLY BROUGHT AROUND FOR

00:59:09.613 --> 00:59:12.616 region:rollup2
A LONG TIME IN AND I TAKE A

00:59:10.981 --> 00:59:13.650 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE OF.

00:59:12.616 --> 00:59:15.919 region:rollup2
COURSE I'M I'M LOOKING AT IT

00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:18.255 region:rollup2
FROM THE SIDE OF HOW WE INCREASE

00:59:15.919 --> 00:59:19.523 region:rollup2
THE. SUPPLY OF HOUSING

00:59:18.255 --> 00:59:21.124 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ABLE TO REALLY

00:59:19.523 --> 00:59:22.793 region:rollup2
PROVIDING AND SOLVE ALL OF THESE

00:59:21.124 --> 00:59:23.960 region:rollup2
CONCERNS I I WANTED TO ASK A

00:59:22.793 --> 00:59:24.828 region:rollup2
COUPLE QUESTIONS THE OPPOSITION

00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:25.862 region:rollup2
IF YOU DON'T MIND. DEALING WITH

00:59:24.828 --> 00:59:27.931 region:rollup2
SUPPLY QUESTIONS.

00:59:25.862 --> 00:59:29.032 region:rollup2
.

00:59:27.931 --> 00:59:30.467 region:rollup2
SO I'VE READ THE RECENTLY A

00:59:29.032 --> 00:59:31.601 region:rollup2
REPORT IT'S RECOMMENDING THAT

00:59:30.467 --> 00:59:32.569 region:rollup2
HOUSING INCENTIVIZING THE

00:59:31.601 --> 00:59:34.104 region:rollup2
BUILDING OF MORE HOUSING IS

00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:34.905 region:rollup2
BEING THE BEST APPROACHES TO

00:59:34.104 --> 00:59:36.740 region:rollup2
SOLVING THE STATEWIDE HOUSING

00:59:34.905 --> 00:59:38.675 region:rollup2
CRISIS.

00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:39.910 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T RENT CONTROL REALLY PUT

00:59:38.675 --> 00:59:42.512 region:rollup2
A DAMPER ON.

00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:43.180 region:rollup2
PEOPLE'S INCENTIVES TO BUY ME

00:59:42.512 --> 00:59:44.347 region:rollup2
BY WHAT IT DEVELOPER BUILD MORE

00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:45.715 region:rollup2
HOMES ARE WHY WOULD A A

00:59:44.347 --> 00:59:47.851 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNER DECIDE TO RENT OUT

00:59:45.715 --> 00:59:48.452 region:rollup2
THEIR HOME. IF THEY DO NOT HAVE

00:59:47.851 --> 00:59:51.955 region:rollup2
CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN PRIVATE

00:59:48.452 --> 00:59:52.756 region:rollup2
PROPERTY.

00:59:51.955 --> 00:59:53.790 region:rollup2
YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE

00:59:52.756 --> 00:59:55.192 region:rollup2
QUESTION YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT

00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:57.060 region:rollup2
THE STATE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

00:59:55.192 --> 00:59:58.328 region:rollup2
DID SAY THAT THAT RENT CONTROL

00:59:57.060 --> 01:00:00.397 region:rollup2
WILL DO NOTHING TO INCREASE

00:59:58.328 --> 01:00:00.897 region:rollup2
HOUSING SUPPLY AND IN FACT WOULD

01:00:00.397 --> 01:00:02.466 region:rollup2
INTERFERE WITH HOUSING

01:00:00.897 --> 01:00:02.933 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION. IS PROBABLY THE

01:00:02.466 --> 01:00:05.001 region:rollup2
DUELING.

01:00:02.933 --> 01:00:06.703 region:rollup2
THE DUELING STUDIES IF YOU WILL

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:07.804 region:rollup2
STANFORD UNIVERSITY FOUND IT

01:00:06.703 --> 01:00:08.939 region:rollup2
CITIES WITH LANDLORDS WHOSE

01:00:07.804 --> 01:00:10.440 region:rollup2
PROPERTIES WERE COVERED BY RENT

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:12.409 region:rollup2
CONTROL RUSE REDUCE THEIR SUPPLY

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:13.810 region:rollup2
BY FIFTEEN PERCENT. AGAIN WE

01:00:12.409 --> 01:00:15.712 region:rollup2
HAVE THE SMALL OWNERS WANTING TO

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:17.180 region:rollup2
GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS FOR FEAR

01:00:15.712 --> 01:00:20.083 region:rollup2
OF RENT CONTROL ON THE WAY THAT

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:22.385 region:rollup2
WOULD APPLY TO SINGLE FAMILY

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:23.520 region:rollup2
HOMES. SO IF IN FACT WE END UP

01:00:22.385 --> 01:00:24.988 region:rollup2
WITH EXTREME FORMS OF RENT

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:26.756 region:rollup2
CONTROL LIKE WE DO THE NINETEEN

01:00:24.988 --> 01:00:28.291 region:rollup2
SEVENTIES WHEN WE SAW.

01:00:26.756 --> 01:00:30.160 region:rollup2
HOUSING CONSTRUCTION.

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:31.828 region:rollup2
SLOWING DOWN I THINK WE'RE

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:33.830 region:rollup2
GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE THAT IN

01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:35.999 region:rollup2
OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS.

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:37.934 region:rollup2
MISS RAY ALSO HAS A A PERSONAL

01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:39.135 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE WITH THAT BECAUSE THE

01:00:37.934 --> 01:00:40.537 region:rollup2
DEVELOPERS OF TOLD HER WE'RE

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:41.705 region:rollup2
GONNA STOP WE'RE GONNA STOP

01:00:40.537 --> 01:00:44.107 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW WE WANT TO SEE WHAT

01:00:41.705 --> 01:00:45.175 region:rollup2
THE STATE INITIATIVE WILL DO AND

01:00:44.107 --> 01:00:47.377 region:rollup2
IF IT DOES ALLOW LOCAL

01:00:45.175 --> 01:00:50.213 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS. TO PASS MORE

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:51.781 region:rollup2
EXTREME FORMS OF RENT CONTROL

01:00:50.213 --> 01:00:52.349 region:rollup2
WERE NOT GOING TO PROCEED.

01:00:51.781 --> 01:00:53.016 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD MY CONCERN IS THAT

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:54.384 region:rollup2
THIS WILL HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT

01:00:53.016 --> 01:00:55.852 region:rollup2
ON DEVELOPMENT OF NEW HOMES WE

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:57.087 region:rollup2
RECENTLY SAW WITH THE TRAGIC

01:00:55.852 --> 01:00:58.488 region:rollup2
FIRES IN CALIFORNIA.

01:00:57.087 --> 01:00:59.789 region:rollup2
I THINK THE ESTIMATES ARE TEN

01:00:58.488 --> 01:01:00.957 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETEEN

01:00:59.789 --> 01:01:02.692 region:rollup2
HOMES WERE DESTROYED IN THOSE

01:01:00.957 --> 01:01:03.560 region:rollup2
PLACES. YOU KNOW MY CONCERN IS

01:01:02.692 --> 01:01:05.962 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE INCENTIVE FOR

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:08.198 region:rollup2
DEVELOPERS AND FOR HOMEOWNERS TO

01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:09.966 region:rollup2
GO AHEAD AND AND REBUILD OR TO

01:01:08.198 --> 01:01:11.101 region:rollup2
REPURCHASE THOSE HOMES AB AND

01:01:09.966 --> 01:01:12.903 region:rollup2
THEN WE COUPLE THAT ALSO WITH.

01:01:11.101 --> 01:01:14.671 region:rollup2
THE DISCUSSIONS OVER THE LAST

01:01:12.903 --> 01:01:15.539 region:rollup2
FIVE YEARS ABOUT APPLYING SPLIT

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:17.207 region:rollup2
ROLE.

01:01:15.539 --> 01:01:19.176 region:rollup2
SPLIT WILL TAXATION WHICH WOULD

01:01:17.207 --> 01:01:20.944 region:rollup2
LEAD YOU TO MODIFY PROP THIRTEEN

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:22.479 region:rollup2
ANY ANY COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION

01:01:20.944 --> 01:01:24.180 region:rollup2
OR ANY HOUSING UNITS SINGLE

01:01:22.479 --> 01:01:25.749 region:rollup2
FAMILY DWELLING THAT WOULD BE

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:27.651 region:rollup2
OPEN FOR RENT WOULD THEN BE. I'M

01:01:25.749 --> 01:01:29.786 region:rollup2
SUBJECT TO CURRENT REASSESSMENT

01:01:27.651 --> 01:01:31.721 region:rollup2
OF THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY

01:01:29.786 --> 01:01:33.089 region:rollup2
HOW IN THE WORLD COULD YOU. TAKE

01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:33.723 region:rollup2
THOSE TWO ELEMENTS AND SAY THAT

01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:35.959 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO.

01:01:33.723 --> 01:01:37.260 region:rollup2
REVALUED THE PROPERTY TAXES AND

01:01:35.959 --> 01:01:38.962 region:rollup2
BUT YET WE'RE GOING TO CONTROL

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:40.497 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH YOU'RE ABLE TO RENT

01:01:38.962 --> 01:01:41.965 region:rollup2
YOUR YOUR PERSONAL PRIVATE

01:01:40.497 --> 01:01:43.333 region:rollup2
PROPERTY FOR.

01:01:41.965 --> 01:01:44.301 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE AN INCREASE IN COST ON

01:01:43.333 --> 01:01:45.969 region:rollup2
ONE SIDE YOU HAVE A.

01:01:44.301 --> 01:01:47.003 region:rollup2
DECREASES SPARSE THE AMOUNT

01:01:45.969 --> 01:01:48.538 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ABLE TO CHARGE HOW IN THE

01:01:47.003 --> 01:01:49.606 region:rollup2
WORLD TO WE POSSIBLY SEE THAT WE

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:51.274 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE PEOPLE HOLD ON TO

01:01:49.606 --> 01:01:53.376 region:rollup2
HOMES AND NOT JUST GO AHEAD AND

01:01:51.274 --> 01:01:54.611 region:rollup2
SELL THEM.

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:55.412 region:rollup2
AND YET YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT I

01:01:54.611 --> 01:01:57.047 region:rollup2
THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE

01:01:55.412 --> 01:01:59.516 region:rollup2
ALSO FACE IN FACT EVERYONE IN

01:01:57.047 --> 01:02:01.184 region:rollup2
THIS ROOM FACES IS THAT THE%

01:01:59.516 --> 01:02:02.319 region:rollup2
ENEMIES OF THE NOT MY BACKYARD

01:02:01.184 --> 01:02:05.021 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS COME TO LOCAL

01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:07.290 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS. PUT PRESSURE ON

01:02:05.021 --> 01:02:08.758 region:rollup2
THE OFFICIALS TO STOP HOUSING

01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:10.460 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION THIS IS A DREAM

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:12.195 region:rollup2
COME TRUE FOR THE NEWBIES THEY

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:13.530 region:rollup2
CAN STOP HOUSING CONSTRUCTION

01:02:12.195 --> 01:02:15.065 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO ADD

01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:17.234 region:rollup2
TO THE PROBLEM AS WE GO FORWARD.

01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:19.002 region:rollup2
IF WE DON'T ALL TOGETHER THE

01:02:17.234 --> 01:02:20.604 region:rollup2
SNAPPERS IN THE ROOM DON'T COME

01:02:19.002 --> 01:02:22.205 region:rollup2
TOGETHER WE ALL COME TOGETHER

01:02:20.604 --> 01:02:23.506 region:rollup2
AND PROMOTE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION

01:02:22.205 --> 01:02:25.475 region:rollup2
IF WE ALL CAME TOGETHER IN THE

01:02:23.506 --> 01:02:26.276 region:rollup2
BUSES AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS.

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:28.378 region:rollup2
AND DEMANDED THE HOUSING

01:02:26.276 --> 01:02:29.245 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION WE WOULD SEE A HUGE

01:02:28.378 --> 01:02:31.414 region:rollup2
CHANGE IN OUR LOCAL

01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:32.115 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS WELL IF I IF IF I

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:33.817 region:rollup2
MIGHT.

01:02:32.115 --> 01:02:35.385 region:rollup2
I THINK GOT FOR THE MOST PART

01:02:33.817 --> 01:02:36.953 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM DO SUPPORT

01:02:35.385 --> 01:02:38.455 region:rollup2
HOUSING CONSTRUCTION CERTAINLY.

01:02:36.953 --> 01:02:40.290 region:rollup2
THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL

01:02:38.455 --> 01:02:42.258 region:rollup2
SUPPORTS HOUSING CONSTRUCTION I

01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:44.961 region:rollup2
CAN TELL YOU THAT.

ATTENTION THERE.

01:03:34.711 --> 01:03:39.783 region:rollup2

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:51.695 region:rollup2
WHEN WE SPOKE ABOUT THE HOUSING

PATRICK PACKAGE THAT WAS PASSED

01:03:51.695 --> 01:03:55.799 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR A LOT OF THAT REALLY

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:57.267 region:rollup2
WE SAW REMOVING SOME OF THE

01:03:55.799 --> 01:03:58.802 region:rollup2
CONTROL FROM LOCAL CONTROL WEEK

01:03:57.267 --> 01:03:59.502 region:rollup2
WE BROUGHT A LOT OF THAT IT TO

01:03:58.802 --> 01:04:01.971 region:rollup2
STAY CONTROL TO BE ABLE TO

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:02.939 region:rollup2
PREVENT AND. HELP WITH THE NIMBY

01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:04.641 region:rollup2
ASPECT OF IT BUT YET WITH THIS

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:07.077 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL WE WOULD BE TURNING IT

01:04:04.641 --> 01:04:08.378 region:rollup2
RIGHT BACK TO VERY LOCAL CONTROL

01:04:07.077 --> 01:04:09.379 region:rollup2
AND PUTTING RIGHT INTO THE HANDS

01:04:08.378 --> 01:04:11.281 region:rollup2
OF THE ENEMY SO IT'S A WE'RE IN

THINK THERE'S A CONFLICT IT HERE

01:04:15.819 --> 01:04:19.322 region:rollup2
AT ALL I THINK THERE ARE SOME

01:04:17.721 --> 01:04:19.889 region:rollup2
ISSUES WHERE IT'S APPROPRIATE

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:21.624 region:rollup2
THAT THE STATE STEP BACK AND

01:04:19.889 --> 01:04:23.760 region:rollup2

AYE STATEWIDE.

01:04:25.762 --> 01:04:28.631 region:rollup2
APPLICATION OF LAW ON

01:04:27.564 --> 01:04:29.299 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR ISSUES AND WE DID

01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:31.768 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:04:29.299 --> 01:04:33.737 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT.

01:04:31.768 --> 01:04:35.739 region:rollup2
THAT YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR ARE

A BELIEVER IN LOCAL CONTROL AND

01:04:35.739 --> 01:04:39.609 region:rollup2
I AGREE TO THAT THERE ARE SOME

01:04:37.907 --> 01:04:41.745 region:rollup2
ISSUES ON WHICH A LITTLE MORE

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:44.347 region:rollup2
LOCAL CONTROL IS THE APPROPRIATE

01:04:41.745 --> 01:04:47.617 region:rollup2
PLACE TO GO THERE'S NO ONE SIZE

01:04:44.347 --> 01:04:49.719 region:rollup2
THAT FITS ALL HERE. AND I'D LIKE

01:04:47.617 --> 01:04:51.321 region:rollup2
TO SAY ALSO THAT.

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:52.856 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:04:51.321 --> 01:04:54.190 region:rollup2
WHEN WHAT WE TALK ABOUT HOUSING

01:04:52.856 --> 01:04:55.125 region:rollup2
SUPPLY THE ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO

01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:57.193 region:rollup2
BE CONCERNED ABOUT HERE IS

01:04:55.125 --> 01:04:58.361 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUPPLY AND IF

01:04:57.193 --> 01:05:00.530 region:rollup2
YOU LOOK AT MANY COMMUNITIES

01:04:58.361 --> 01:05:01.831 region:rollup2
INCLUDING MY OWN. UNLESS WE ARE

AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE HOUSING

THAT IS BEING BUILT TODAY IS

01:05:05.769 --> 01:05:08.838 region:rollup2
UNAFFORDABLE TO EVERY DAY

01:05:07.303 --> 01:05:10.407 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS AND THAT ALSO IS

01:05:08.838 --> 01:05:12.342 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE THAT.

01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:13.443 region:rollup2

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:17.213 region:rollup2
AND TOPICS WE ARE YOU KNOW WE

01:05:16.646 --> 01:05:18.114 region:rollup2
JUST APPROACH FROM A LITTLE

01:05:17.213 --> 01:05:19.883 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ANGLES. BECAUSE I ALSO

01:05:18.114 --> 01:05:21.551 region:rollup2
BELIEVE AND AND REALLY TRYING TO

01:05:19.883 --> 01:05:22.952 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:05:21.551 --> 01:05:24.721 region:rollup2
IN A LOT OF WAYS I BELIEVE WE

01:05:22.952 --> 01:05:26.189 region:rollup2
CAN DO THAT IS BY MAKING MORE

01:05:24.721 --> 01:05:27.357 region:rollup2
HOUSING AFFORDABLE. WHICH IS

01:05:26.189 --> 01:05:28.191 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE OVERALL SUPPLY

01:05:27.357 --> 01:05:29.259 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY WHAT WE'RE

01:05:28.191 --> 01:05:30.660 region:rollup2
DISCUSSING HERE IS A SUPPLY AND

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:34.631 region:rollup2
DEMAND ISSUE.

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:37.233 region:rollup2
IT MY OPINION WE HAVE A LOT OF.

01:05:34.631 --> 01:05:38.601 region:rollup2
WE WE HAVE A LOT OF A DEMAND AS

01:05:37.233 --> 01:05:39.202 region:rollup2
FAR AS THE AMOUNT OF UNITS ARE

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:40.603 region:rollup2
COMING IN FOR FOR.

01:05:39.202 --> 01:05:42.539 region:rollup2
.

01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:44.240 region:rollup2
WE YOU KNOW JOBS BUT NOT AS MANY

01:05:42.539 --> 01:05:45.441 region:rollup2
UNITS FOR HOUSING AND SPECIALLY

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.042 region:rollup2
IN THESE URBAN AREAS OF THE

01:05:45.441 --> 01:05:48.011 region:rollup2
COSTA COMMUNITIES THAT WE'VE

01:05:46.042 --> 01:05:48.945 region:rollup2
BEEN REFERRING TO. SO BUT LET'S

01:05:48.011 --> 01:05:49.913 region:rollup2
DON'T CHANGE THE TOPIC JUST A

01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:51.848 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT LET'S TALK ABOUT IN

01:05:49.913 --> 01:05:53.216 region:rollup2
ITS IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE DO

01:05:51.848 --> 01:05:56.152 region:rollup2
HAVE A RIGHT CONTROL.

01:05:53.216 --> 01:05:57.587 region:rollup2
IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A LOT OF

01:05:56.152 --> 01:05:58.621 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN RENT CONTROL

01:05:57.587 --> 01:06:00.223 region:rollup2
UNITS DO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:01.491 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE IN THE UPKEEP OF THE

01:06:00.223 --> 01:06:03.293 region:rollup2
PROPERTIES.

01:06:01.491 --> 01:06:04.828 region:rollup2
DOESN'T RENT CONTROL DISCOURAGE

01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:06.563 region:rollup2
THE UPKEEP AND MODERNIZATION

01:06:04.828 --> 01:06:08.198 region:rollup2
FRIENDLINESS LANDLORDS NOT BEING

01:06:06.563 --> 01:06:09.165 region:rollup2
ABLE TO SEE A RETURN ON THEIR

01:06:08.198 --> 01:06:09.566 region:rollup2
INVESTORS MAY AGAIN I'M GONNA AS

01:06:09.165 --> 01:06:10.633 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF PUBLIC

01:06:09.566 --> 01:06:12.468 region:rollup2
PLEASE.

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:15.238 region:rollup2
PLEASE.

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:16.472 region:rollup2
DO NOT EXPRESS BUCKLEY YOUR

01:06:15.238 --> 01:06:17.774 region:rollup2
PROSPECTIVE AGAIN THE JAZZ HANDS

01:06:16.472 --> 01:06:19.242 region:rollup2
ON THE THUMBS ARE FINE BUT.

01:06:17.774 --> 01:06:20.009 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WANT.

01:06:19.242 --> 01:06:22.345 region:rollup2
THAT THE CONVERSATION BE

01:06:20.009 --> 01:06:23.313 region:rollup2
INTERRUPTED.

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:24.447 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR I THINK

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:25.248 region:rollup2
GOD IS REAGANISM THE BEST

01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:26.282 region:rollup2
POSITION ANSWERED THANK YOU I'M

01:06:25.248 --> 01:06:27.217 region:rollup2
GLAD YOU ASKED THAT QUESTION

01:06:26.282 --> 01:06:28.551 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S UP A LARGE

01:06:27.217 --> 01:06:29.853 region:rollup2
MISCONCEPTION THAT A LOT OF

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:31.287 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HOLD ABOUT RENT CONTROL I

01:06:29.853 --> 01:06:32.488 region:rollup2
THINK ONE POINT IT'S IMPORTANT

01:06:31.287 --> 01:06:35.124 region:rollup2
TO MAKE.

01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:36.159 region:rollup2
A THE CASE LAW REQUIRES THAT ANY

01:06:35.124 --> 01:06:37.794 region:rollup2
RENT CONTROL ORDINANCE THAT'S IT

01:06:36.159 --> 01:06:39.929 region:rollup2
THAT'S PASSED

01:06:37.794 --> 01:06:41.297 region:rollup2
MUST GUARANTEE A PROPERTY OWNER

01:06:39.929 --> 01:06:43.366 region:rollup2
A FAIR RETURN A FAIR AND

01:06:41.297 --> 01:06:45.935 region:rollup2
REASONABLE RETURN. ON HIS OR HER

01:06:43.366 --> 01:06:47.537 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT SO THAT IS WHY THIS

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:48.972 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT THAT IT DISINCENTIVE

01:06:47.537 --> 01:06:50.607 region:rollup2
VISES CONSTRUCTION IS COULD

01:06:48.972 --> 01:06:52.275 region:rollup2
COMPLETE RED HERRING BECAUSE

01:06:50.607 --> 01:06:53.576 region:rollup2
CASE LAW PROHIBITS THAT.

01:06:52.275 --> 01:06:54.644 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS

01:06:53.576 --> 01:06:56.513 region:rollup2
THE SAME GOES TO FOR THE

01:06:54.644 --> 01:06:58.848 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE OF THESE PROPERTIES.

01:06:56.513 --> 01:07:01.684 region:rollup2
IF A IF A LANDLORD FINDS THAT HE

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:04.020 region:rollup2
OR SHE IS HAVING TO EXPEND

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:05.455 region:rollup2
CAPITAL. INVESTMENT IN A IN A

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:08.157 region:rollup2
MAIN THAT'S PROJECT.

01:07:05.455 --> 01:07:10.526 region:rollup2
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE.

01:07:08.157 --> 01:07:12.462 region:rollup2
COME TO THE LOCAL LEVEL AND

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:14.264 region:rollup2
THOSE RENTING THOSE RENTAL RATES

01:07:12.462 --> 01:07:16.432 region:rollup2
COULD BE INCREASED ON THAT BASIS

01:07:14.264 --> 01:07:18.468 region:rollup2
SO ALL OF THESE ISSUES THAT

01:07:16.432 --> 01:07:20.837 region:rollup2
YOU'RE RAISING HAVE BEEN. I'M

01:07:18.468 --> 01:07:23.039 region:rollup2
ALREADY ADDRESSED IN EITHER BY

01:07:20.837 --> 01:07:24.140 region:rollup2
CASE LAW OR BY THE ORDINANCES

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:26.809 region:rollup2
UNDER WHICH THESE LAWS HAVE BEEN

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:28.344 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED.

01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:30.647 region:rollup2
I'M AND I JUST I WOULD JUST LIKE

01:07:28.344 --> 01:07:32.749 region:rollup2
TO ADD JOBS THAT I SAT ON THE ON

01:07:30.647 --> 01:07:34.951 region:rollup2
THE RENT BOARD IN IN OAKLAND.

01:07:32.749 --> 01:07:36.252 region:rollup2
AND SO FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS

01:07:34.951 --> 01:07:37.987 region:rollup2
LANDLORDS WERE ABLE TO COME AS

01:07:36.252 --> 01:07:39.088 region:rollup2
AN AND PETITION TO GET RENT

01:07:37.987 --> 01:07:40.924 region:rollup2
INCREASES FOR THOSE CAPITAL

01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:42.659 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS THEY ALSO DURING

01:07:40.924 --> 01:07:43.927 region:rollup2
THE DURING THE BIG DEBT CRISIS

01:07:42.659 --> 01:07:45.395 region:rollup2
IN THE HOUSING CRISIS. I'M

01:07:43.927 --> 01:07:47.330 region:rollup2
FACING THEIR LOANS THEY WERE

01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:48.998 region:rollup2
ABLE TO GET INCREASES I MEAN

01:07:47.330 --> 01:07:50.500 region:rollup2
INCREASES IN THEIR RENTS AND

01:07:48.998 --> 01:07:51.935 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY APPLY FOR THOSE

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:53.002 region:rollup2
INCREASES.

01:07:51.935 --> 01:07:54.771 region:rollup2
BUT TENANTS BECAUSE OF COSTA

01:07:53.002 --> 01:07:56.506 region:rollup2
HAWKINS WERE NOT ABLE TO GET

01:07:54.771 --> 01:07:58.474 region:rollup2
INCREASES SPECIFICALLY IN THE

01:07:56.506 --> 01:08:00.243 region:rollup2
SITUATION WE HAVE NOW WITH THIS

01:07:58.474 --> 01:08:01.744 region:rollup2
HOUSING SHORTAGE HOUSING CRISIS

01:08:00.243 --> 01:08:03.313 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT

01:08:01.744 --> 01:08:05.515 region:rollup2
HAPPENED TO LANDLORDS DOING

01:08:03.313 --> 01:08:06.215 region:rollup2
THOSE FAULTY LOANS. BUT BECAUSE

01:08:05.515 --> 01:08:07.917 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THIS COMPLETELY

01:08:06.215 --> 01:08:09.118 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT AND A LAW

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:11.254 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR

01:08:09.118 --> 01:08:13.089 region:rollup2
OVER TWENTY YEARS WE CAN'T LOCAL

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:15.491 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS CAN'T. MEET THE

01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:17.860 region:rollup2
NEED OF THEIR RESIDENTS TO KIND

01:08:15.491 --> 01:08:20.129 region:rollup2
OF AUGMENT THE RED SPECIFICALLY

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:21.831 region:rollup2
IN A LOT OF IN IN THE BAY AREA

01:08:20.129 --> 01:08:23.199 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES BUT BASICALLY WHEN I

01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:23.733 region:rollup2
WAS ON THE COUNCIL IN

01:08:23.199 --> 01:08:24.934 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE

01:08:23.733 --> 01:08:27.070 region:rollup2
STATE.

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:28.271 region:rollup2
SO BASIS SO IT'S NOT A ONE SIZE

01:08:27.070 --> 01:08:29.706 region:rollup2
FITS ALL IT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:08:28.271 --> 01:08:32.141 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED ON THE

01:08:29.706 --> 01:08:33.676 region:rollup2
LOCAL LEVELS SO THAT THEY CAN

01:08:32.141 --> 01:08:35.645 region:rollup2
REALLY SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:38.348 region:rollup2
THEIR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THIS

01:08:35.645 --> 01:08:40.283 region:rollup2
IS A. IS A HISTORICAL MOMENT

01:08:38.348 --> 01:08:41.484 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE FACING IN CALIFORNIA.

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:42.552 region:rollup2
IF I COULD ASK FOR THE

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:43.586 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION TO RESPOND AS WELL

01:08:42.552 --> 01:08:44.954 region:rollup2
PLEASE I THINK THE ONLY THING.

01:08:43.586 --> 01:08:47.056 region:rollup2
WHAT I WOULD ADD IS WHEN YOU

01:08:44.954 --> 01:08:48.424 region:rollup2
HAVE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT

01:08:47.056 --> 01:08:49.459 region:rollup2
ONLY THAT ROLL BACK RENTS WHEN

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:51.194 region:rollup2
THEY WERE FIRST?

01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:52.228 region:rollup2
ADOPTED SOME OF THE OWNERS

01:08:51.194 --> 01:08:53.763 region:rollup2
NEVER CAUGHT UP BECAUSE TENNIS

01:08:52.228 --> 01:08:55.098 region:rollup2
NEVER MOVED WITH THE VACANCY DE

01:08:53.763 --> 01:08:56.466 region:rollup2
CONTROL THAT'S ALLOWED UNDER

01:08:55.098 --> 01:08:57.900 region:rollup2
COSTA HAWKINS.

01:08:56.466 --> 01:09:00.036 region:rollup2
AND WHEN YOU HAVE INCREASES IT

01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:01.671 region:rollup2
ONLY ALLOWED UP TO SIXTY PERCENT

01:09:00.036 --> 01:09:03.006 region:rollup2
OF THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX I

01:09:01.671 --> 01:09:04.140 region:rollup2
WOULD ARGUE THAT THAT IS NOT IN

01:09:03.006 --> 01:09:07.143 region:rollup2
FACT SOMETHING THAT HELPS THE

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:08.244 region:rollup2
LANDLORD. A RECOUP COSTS AND.

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:10.346 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH IN SOME

01:09:08.244 --> 01:09:12.382 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS THEY WILL ALLOW

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:13.549 region:rollup2
YOU TO COME BEFORE OF THE RAM

01:09:12.382 --> 01:09:15.151 region:rollup2
BORDEN ASK.

01:09:13.549 --> 01:09:16.586 region:rollup2
FOR AN INCREASE IS NOT ALWAYS

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:18.354 region:rollup2
GRANTED TOWARDS GRANTED OVER

01:09:16.586 --> 01:09:19.856 region:rollup2
THIRTY YEARS DEPENDING UPON WHAT

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:22.091 region:rollup2
YOU'VE DONE TO YOUR PROPERTY SO

01:09:19.856 --> 01:09:23.726 region:rollup2
IT AGAIN IT'S NOT A SURE THING

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:24.260 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

01:09:23.726 --> 01:09:25.928 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:27.030 region:rollup2
THE RENT CONTROL IN OUR LOCAL

01:09:25.928 --> 01:09:28.398 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS.

01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:29.666 region:rollup2
OKAY AND THEN JUST MY FINAL

01:09:28.398 --> 01:09:31.067 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS WITH THE CHAIRS.

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:33.469 region:rollup2
PERMISSION I JUST WANNA ASK.

01:09:31.067 --> 01:09:33.770 region:rollup2
FOR RENT CONTROL AN OBJECT IS

01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:38.941 region:rollup2
TO.

01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:41.277 region:rollup2
IT IS IT MEANS TESTED.

01:09:38.941 --> 01:09:42.712 region:rollup2
MEANS TESTING.

01:09:41.277 --> 01:09:45.314 region:rollup2
NO LONGER.

01:09:42.712 --> 01:09:47.150 region:rollup2
I WAS IS SHORT ANSWER IS NO IT'S

01:09:45.314 --> 01:09:48.117 region:rollup2
NOT MEANS TESTING SOMETIMES THE

01:09:47.150 --> 01:09:50.119 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY.

01:09:48.117 --> 01:09:51.821 region:rollup2
HAVE PROPOSES THAT IT'S BEEN

01:09:50.119 --> 01:09:52.789 region:rollup2
FLOATED AT DIFFERENT TIMES IT'S

01:09:51.821 --> 01:09:54.857 region:rollup2
GENERALLY VIEWED WHEN YOU DIG

01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:57.126 region:rollup2
INTO IT AS A SOLUTION LOOKING

01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:58.428 region:rollup2
FOR A PROBLEM IN THAT TENANTS

01:09:57.126 --> 01:10:00.363 region:rollup2
ARE OVERWHELMINGLY LOW IN MY.

01:09:58.428 --> 01:10:01.831 region:rollup2
INCOME AND THOSE WHO ARE VERY

01:10:00.363 --> 01:10:03.533 region:rollup2
HIGH INCOME GO OFTEN TEND TO GO

01:10:01.831 --> 01:10:05.001 region:rollup2
OFF AND BUY PROPERTY.

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:06.536 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S ALSO A VERY

01:10:05.001 --> 01:10:08.504 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS AROUND

01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:10.473 region:rollup2
PRIVACY INVASION AND ALSO

01:10:08.504 --> 01:10:12.308 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL DISCRIMINATION THAT

01:10:10.473 --> 01:10:13.943 region:rollup2
ARE ONLY HIGHER INCOME TENANTS

01:10:12.308 --> 01:10:15.445 region:rollup2
WHO WOULD BE EXEMPT FROM RENT

01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:17.113 region:rollup2
CONTROL IN SOME WAY WOULD BE

01:10:15.445 --> 01:10:19.315 region:rollup2
RENTED TOO SO THAT'S WHY.

01:10:17.113 --> 01:10:20.249 region:rollup2
ADVOCATES GENERALLY ARE OPPOSED

01:10:19.315 --> 01:10:21.451 region:rollup2
AND WHY NONE OF THE

01:10:20.249 --> 01:10:22.452 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE RENT

01:10:21.451 --> 01:10:23.086 region:rollup2
CONTROL ALTHOUGH THEY'VE

01:10:22.452 --> 01:10:24.287 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED THAT.

01:10:23.086 --> 01:10:25.455 region:rollup2
OVER THE YEARS WHEN YOU

01:10:24.287 --> 01:10:28.291 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DIG INTO IT.

01:10:25.455 --> 01:10:28.991 region:rollup2
USUALLY THE BETTER POLICY IT IS

01:10:28.291 --> 01:10:30.460 region:rollup2
TO.

01:10:28.991 --> 01:10:32.361 region:rollup2
IS TO NOT MEANS TESTED THERE'S

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:33.863 region:rollup2
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THAT THAT JUST

01:10:32.361 --> 01:10:35.098 region:rollup2
HAPPENS NATURALLY BASED ON THE

ALL THE HER DOING SO SUCH AS A

01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:46.455 region:rollup2
SEQUEL AND THE ROLE LOCAL

01:18:45.921 --> 01:18:48.290 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS.

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:49.124 region:rollup2
THAT'S MY LAST QUESTION.

01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:50.426 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MR ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND

01:18:49.124 --> 01:18:52.227 region:rollup2

UP THROUGH YOUR QUESTION SIR.

01:18:58.033 --> 01:19:01.604 region:rollup2
ALL TRY TO DO IT IN ROUTE IN

01:19:00.002 --> 01:19:03.072 region:rollup2
REVERSE ORDER BECAUSE I WOULD

01:19:01.604 --> 01:19:05.140 region:rollup2
LIKE TO START WITH ASAP QUESTION

01:19:03.072 --> 01:19:06.442 region:rollup2
YOU RAISE ABOUT SEQUEL AND

01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:08.677 region:rollup2
FRANKLY I THINK.

01:19:06.442 --> 01:19:10.012 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE A GRAVE ERROR FOR

01:19:08.677 --> 01:19:11.513 region:rollup2
US TO TURN THIS.

01:19:10.012 --> 01:19:13.315 region:rollup2
HEARING INTO A DEBATE ABOUT

01:19:11.513 --> 01:19:13.849 region:rollup2
SEAQUEST SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT

01:19:13.315 --> 01:19:14.383 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'S ROOM FOR

01:19:13.849 --> 01:19:16.252 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION ON THAT ON THAT

01:19:14.383 --> 01:19:17.620 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

01:19:16.252 --> 01:19:19.388 region:rollup2
.

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:21.690 region:rollup2
TO SOME DEGREE CERTAINLY YOU

01:19:19.388 --> 01:19:24.293 region:rollup2
AND I AGREE THAT THERE IS A

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:25.361 region:rollup2
SUPPLY HOUSING SUPPLY ISSUE AND

01:19:24.293 --> 01:19:27.363 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE.

01:19:25.361 --> 01:19:29.131 region:rollup2
IN FACT THAT'S WHAT MUCH OF

01:19:27.363 --> 01:19:29.999 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR'S HOUSING PACKAGE WAS

01:19:29.131 --> 01:19:31.467 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:19:29.999 --> 01:19:33.969 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING THAT SUPPLY ISSUE

01:19:31.467 --> 01:19:35.671 region:rollup2
WHETHER WE AGREE OR DISAGREE ON

01:19:33.969 --> 01:19:37.873 region:rollup2
THE SPECIFIC SOLUTIONS THAT WERE

01:19:35.671 --> 01:19:39.575 region:rollup2
ENACTED INTO LAW LAST YEAR EVEN

01:19:37.873 --> 01:19:41.010 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE HAT DIDN'T MAKE

01:19:39.575 --> 01:19:41.710 region:rollup2
IT THROUGH THE PROCESS.

01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:43.312 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THAT THIS

01:19:41.710 --> 01:19:45.047 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE HAS SPENT A GOOD

01:19:43.312 --> 01:19:47.850 region:rollup2
DEAL OF TIME ADDRESSING THAT

01:19:45.047 --> 01:19:49.418 region:rollup2
VERY ISSUE I WOULD LIKE TO

01:19:47.850 --> 01:19:51.320 region:rollup2
REEMPHASIZE THAT.

01:19:49.418 --> 01:19:53.922 region:rollup2
.

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:55.257 region:rollup2
IF YOU AND I AND OF THIS

01:19:53.922 --> 01:19:56.325 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE

01:19:55.257 --> 01:19:59.628 region:rollup2
AND THE GOVERNOR WERE TO COME

01:19:56.325 --> 01:20:03.899 region:rollup2
TOGETHER WITH EVEN MORE.

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:05.701 region:rollup2
WAYS OF PROVIDING FOR MORE

01:20:03.899 --> 01:20:08.604 region:rollup2
HOUSING CONSTRUCTION AS I

01:20:05.701 --> 01:20:11.707 region:rollup2
BELIEVE WE SHOULD.

01:20:08.604 --> 01:20:12.441 region:rollup2
BY THE TIME WE PASSED THOSE LAWS

01:20:11.707 --> 01:20:14.643 region:rollup2
THOSE.

01:20:12.441 --> 01:20:16.845 region:rollup2
AYE DEVELOPERS WHO WANT TO

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:19.448 region:rollup2
BUILD COME UP WITH PLANS TO DO

01:20:16.845 --> 01:20:21.216 region:rollup2
SO PUT IT THROUGH THE PROCESS IN

01:20:19.448 --> 01:20:24.119 region:rollup2
LOCAL COMMUNITIES BEGIN

01:20:21.216 --> 01:20:26.789 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION AND ACTUALLY.

01:20:24.119 --> 01:20:29.224 region:rollup2
HAVE THOSE UNITS COME ONLINE

01:20:26.789 --> 01:20:31.460 region:rollup2
SEVERAL YEARS AT A MINIMUM ARE

01:20:29.224 --> 01:20:33.228 region:rollup2
GOING TO PASS THE PIPELINE FOR

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:35.331 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTING THOSE HOMES IS VERY

01:20:33.228 --> 01:20:38.033 region:rollup2
LENGTHY.

01:20:35.331 --> 01:20:39.234 region:rollup2
AS I TRIED TO ARTICULATE IN THE

01:20:38.033 --> 01:20:41.003 region:rollup2
BEGINNING OF MY REMARKS.

01:20:39.234 --> 01:20:43.472 region:rollup2
OF

01:20:41.003 --> 01:20:46.809 region:rollup2
QUESTION THAT WE ARE PRESENTED

01:20:43.472 --> 01:20:49.178 region:rollup2
WITH HERE TODAY IS WHAT CAN WE

01:20:46.809 --> 01:20:52.014 region:rollup2
DO TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE WHO

01:20:49.178 --> 01:20:54.249 region:rollup2
TODAY. ARE BEING IMPACTED BY

01:20:52.014 --> 01:20:56.452 region:rollup2
RENTS THAT ARE TOO DAMN HIGH

01:20:54.249 --> 01:20:58.020 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD. AND

01:20:56.452 --> 01:21:00.155 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO FOCUS

01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:02.358 region:rollup2
OUR ATTENTION HERE TODAY BUT I

01:21:00.155 --> 01:21:03.992 region:rollup2
RESPECT AND APPRECIATE THAT WE

01:21:02.358 --> 01:21:05.894 region:rollup2
NEED TO CONTINUE TO KEEP OUR EYE

01:21:03.992 --> 01:21:06.462 region:rollup2
ON ALL THESE OTHER ISSUES AND

01:21:05.894 --> 01:21:09.298 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO LEGISLATE. ON AT

01:21:06.462 --> 01:21:12.101 region:rollup2
THE.

01:21:09.298 --> 01:21:12.968 region:rollup2
A BILL SIGNING IN IN IN THE

01:21:12.101 --> 01:21:15.604 region:rollup2
FALL THAT.

01:21:12.968 --> 01:21:17.272 region:rollup2
R. CHAIR AND MANY OTHER MEMBERS.

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:20.476 region:rollup2
ATTENDED IN THE EYE AND I WAS

01:21:17.272 --> 01:21:23.045 region:rollup2
THERE VIRTUALLY EVERY SPEAKER

01:21:20.476 --> 01:21:25.247 region:rollup2
SAID WE HAVE BEGUN. THE WORK

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:26.148 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S MUCH MUCH MORE TO DO

01:21:25.247 --> 01:21:26.782 region:rollup2
SO I THINK WERE IN A COURT ON

01:21:26.148 --> 01:21:30.986 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:21:26.782 --> 01:21:31.787 region:rollup2
.

01:21:30.986 --> 01:21:34.490 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO.

01:21:31.787 --> 01:21:37.493 region:rollup2
.

01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:39.161 region:rollup2
THE WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT

01:21:37.493 --> 01:21:42.831 region:rollup2
PROVIDES LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE

01:21:39.161 --> 01:21:45.801 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO TAILOR SOLUTIONS TO

01:21:42.831 --> 01:21:47.603 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN NEEDS AND SO YOU ARE

01:21:45.801 --> 01:21:49.438 region:rollup2
GOING TO FIND IF THIS BILL.

01:21:47.603 --> 01:21:51.006 region:rollup2
OF PASSES AND IS SIGNED INTO

01:21:49.438 --> 01:21:53.041 region:rollup2
LAW.

01:21:51.006 --> 01:21:55.811 region:rollup2
THAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE GOING

01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:58.514 region:rollup2
TO DETERMINE WITH MORE WITH THEM

01:21:55.811 --> 01:22:00.215 region:rollup2
MORE REFINED PAN.

01:21:58.514 --> 01:22:02.484 region:rollup2
WHAT THEIR LOCAL ORDINANCES WILL

01:22:00.215 --> 01:22:04.586 region:rollup2
DO THIS IS NOT A BILL THAT

01:22:02.484 --> 01:22:05.621 region:rollup2
CREATES STATEWIDE RENT CONTROL

01:22:04.586 --> 01:22:07.289 region:rollup2
LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:22:05.621 --> 01:22:08.991 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT?

01:22:07.289 --> 01:22:10.626 region:rollup2
A THIS IS A BILL THAT ALLOWS

01:22:08.991 --> 01:22:12.094 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DETERMINE

01:22:10.626 --> 01:22:14.930 region:rollup2
FOR THEMSELVES AS THEY ARE THE

01:22:12.094 --> 01:22:16.932 region:rollup2
CAN. ON WHAT ADDITIONAL OTHER

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:18.967 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS THAT WERE PROHIBITED BY

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:21.136 region:rollup2
COSTA HAWKINS WOULD NOW BE

01:22:18.967 --> 01:22:23.105 region:rollup2
INCLUDED OR NOT INCLUDED IN

01:22:21.136 --> 01:22:24.807 region:rollup2
THEIR LOCAL ORDINANCE.

01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:25.073 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR SECOND

01:22:24.807 --> 01:22:27.443 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

01:22:25.073 --> 01:22:29.812 region:rollup2
.

01:22:27.443 --> 01:22:32.347 region:rollup2
I I WANT TO REPEAT THAT A.

01:22:29.812 --> 01:22:34.583 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IS ABOUT.

01:22:32.347 --> 01:22:36.151 region:rollup2
PRESERVING AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:22:34.583 --> 01:22:38.086 region:rollup2
AND OF WAITING DISPLACEMENT AND

01:22:36.151 --> 01:22:39.788 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

01:22:38.086 --> 01:22:41.757 region:rollup2
WHAT IS RENT CONTROL DOING RIGHT

01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:44.693 region:rollup2
NOW WITH COSTA HAWKINS?

01:22:41.757 --> 01:22:46.995 region:rollup2
WE SEE IN VIRTUALLY EVERY RIGHT

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:48.630 region:rollup2
CONTROL JURISDICTION A

01:22:46.995 --> 01:22:53.268 region:rollup2
DIMINUTION OF THE NUMBER AS

01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:55.704 region:rollup2
RENTS GO UP AS UNITS TURN. AND.

01:22:53.268 --> 01:22:59.041 region:rollup2
VACANCY DE CONTROL IS

01:22:55.704 --> 01:23:00.843 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED WE SEE THE DELTA

01:22:59.041 --> 01:23:03.378 region:rollup2
BETWEEN AFFORDABLE AND

01:23:00.843 --> 01:23:05.414 region:rollup2
UNAFFORDABLE RANTS INCREASING

01:23:03.378 --> 01:23:06.782 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN DECREASING. AND

01:23:05.414 --> 01:23:08.183 region:rollup2
THAT'S A PROBLEM SO WE HAVE IT

01:23:06.782 --> 01:23:10.719 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE HAVE A DIMINISH

01:23:08.183 --> 01:23:11.720 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:13.856 region:rollup2
UNITS THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:16.592 region:rollup2
A.

01:23:13.856 --> 01:23:18.093 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY. ON THERE IS AND I

01:23:16.592 --> 01:23:18.594 region:rollup2
THINK I'VE I'VE ALREADY SAID

01:23:18.093 --> 01:23:19.995 region:rollup2
THIS BUT.

01:23:18.594 --> 01:23:22.397 region:rollup2
COMEY TEAR OFF.

01:23:19.995 --> 01:23:24.066 region:rollup2
YOUR FIRST QUESTION.

01:23:22.397 --> 01:23:26.068 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHETHER.

01:23:24.066 --> 01:23:27.603 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WILL ELIMINATE THE

01:23:26.068 --> 01:23:29.972 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

01:23:27.603 --> 01:23:30.472 region:rollup2
A I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY ONE

01:23:29.972 --> 01:23:32.207 region:rollup2
BILL THAT ELIMINATES THE

01:23:30.472 --> 01:23:33.642 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

01:23:32.207 --> 01:23:36.378 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO LOOK

01:23:33.642 --> 01:23:38.413 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE BOAR AT SOLUTIONS WE

01:23:36.378 --> 01:23:40.249 region:rollup2
HAVE ALLOWED AND I WILL TAKE

01:23:38.413 --> 01:23:42.117 region:rollup2
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AS I

01:23:40.249 --> 01:23:44.186 region:rollup2
THINK MANY OF US SHOULD WHO COME

01:23:42.117 --> 01:23:46.955 region:rollup2
FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE

01:23:44.186 --> 01:23:48.790 region:rollup2
ALLOWED FOR MANY YEARS TOOL AND

01:23:46.955 --> 01:23:52.327 region:rollup2
AND AT THE STATE LEVEL TO ALLOW

01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:54.229 region:rollup2
THIS PROBLEM TO GROW AND FASTER.

01:23:52.327 --> 01:23:57.432 region:rollup2
SUCH THAT WE TOOK DAY HAVE A

01:23:54.229 --> 01:24:00.168 region:rollup2
HOUSING CRISIS THAT IS SO DEEP

01:23:57.432 --> 01:24:02.304 region:rollup2
AND SO WIDE THAT IT. DEMANDS A

01:24:00.168 --> 01:24:02.871 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVE EFFORT ON THE PART OF

01:24:02.304 --> 01:24:05.274 region:rollup2
ALL OF US TO SOLVE IT SO NO

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:07.042 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:24:05.274 --> 01:24:08.477 region:rollup2
IS NOT GOING TO ELIMINATE THE

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:15.350 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IT IS GOING TO

01:24:08.477 --> 01:24:17.853 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY HELP.

01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:20.322 region:rollup2
LET ME ARE OF COURSE SO HERE

01:24:17.853 --> 01:24:22.891 region:rollup2
FROM OPPOSITION ASIDE THOUGH

KIDS IN COLLEGE AND I GET IT.

01:27:50.232 --> 01:27:54.102 region:rollup2
IF WE IMPOSE RENT CONTROL.

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:55.237 region:rollup2

01:30:19.147 --> 01:30:23.551 region:rollup2
THE.

01:30:21.216 --> 01:30:25.353 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS CAN BE CRAFTED

01:30:23.551 --> 01:30:26.888 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT IN A WAY THAT FITS THAT

01:30:25.353 --> 01:30:27.489 region:rollup2
THAT PROBLEMS AND AND THE

01:30:26.888 --> 01:30:28.456 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE BEING

01:30:27.489 --> 01:30:29.524 region:rollup2
FACED.

01:30:28.456 --> 01:30:30.859 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT'S IMPORTANT I THINK

01:30:29.524 --> 01:30:32.661 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THIS IS

01:30:30.859 --> 01:30:35.697 region:rollup2
COSTA HAWKINS HAS BEEN. A

01:30:32.661 --> 01:30:37.399 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE ONE SIZE FITS ALL BAR

01:30:35.697 --> 01:30:40.769 region:rollup2
A PROHIBITION

01:30:37.399 --> 01:30:42.137 region:rollup2
AND TODAY WE SIMPLY. ASK THAT WE

01:30:40.769 --> 01:30:43.605 region:rollup2
REMOVE THAT BAR THAT WE LIFT

01:30:42.137 --> 01:30:45.640 region:rollup2
THAT PROHIBITION THAT WE ALLOW

01:30:43.605 --> 01:30:47.042 region:rollup2
FOR A CONVERSATION TO CONTINUE.

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:49.377 region:rollup2
AND THAT.

01:30:47.042 --> 01:30:51.112 region:rollup2
LOCALS. WHO ARE CLOSEST TO THE

01:30:49.377 --> 01:30:53.915 region:rollup2

ADDRESS THE PROBLEM.

01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:02.791 region:rollup2
FAKE IT PROVIDES A TOOL A

01:31:00.889 --> 01:31:04.292 region:rollup2

01:31:20.575 --> 01:31:23.712 region:rollup2
CERTAIN SOME AN ATTACK WHAT

01:31:22.177 --> 01:31:26.514 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES THAT HAVE BEEN.

01:31:23.712 --> 01:31:28.316 region:rollup2
RAISED AROUND SUPPLY SIDE.

01:31:26.514 --> 01:31:29.851 region:rollup2
PROVIDING MORE AFFORDABLE

01:31:28.316 --> 01:31:31.052 region:rollup2
HOUSING WHAT WILL BE ADDRESSED

AND AND AND CAN BE.

01:31:31.052 --> 01:31:33.922 region:rollup2
.

01:31:32.988 --> 01:31:35.323 region:rollup2
IN AND A SOLUTION CAN BE CRAFTED

01:31:33.922 --> 01:31:36.791 region:rollup2
THAT THAT MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:31:35.323 --> 01:31:38.460 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO TO HAVE ROBUST

01:31:36.791 --> 01:31:39.427 region:rollup2
SUPPLYING CALIFORNIA THAT THE

CONTINUES. AND.

01:31:40.595 --> 01:31:43.431 region:rollup2
.

01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:44.432 region:rollup2
WHILE THAT HAPPENS BECAUSE IT'S

01:31:43.431 --> 01:31:45.900 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED THE

01:31:44.432 --> 01:31:47.836 region:rollup2
FUTURE IS A TIME HORIZON FOR

01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:48.937 region:rollup2
THESE NEW UNITS TO BE. BROUGHT

01:31:47.836 --> 01:31:50.205 region:rollup2
ONLINE THAT TENANTS WHO ARE

DEPRIVE OUR LOCAL LEADERS OF OF

01:32:01.449 --> 01:32:05.086 region:rollup2
A TOOL. THAT THEY CAN USE TO

THAT IT'S.

01:32:10.392 --> 01:32:13.361 region:rollup2

IT NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED AND I

01:32:19.634 --> 01:32:23.238 region:rollup2
AND I THINK.

01:32:20.735 --> 01:32:24.572 region:rollup2
THAT CALIFORNIA'S DESERVE IT

01:32:23.238 --> 01:32:26.307 region:rollup2

01:32:24.572 --> 01:32:28.743 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S IT'S PART OF OUR

01:32:26.307 --> 01:32:31.212 region:rollup2
ONGOING EFFORT TO STAND UP FOR.

OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:33:37.812 --> 01:33:42.083 region:rollup2
EXPRESSED ALREADY.

01:33:39.747 --> 01:33:43.785 region:rollup2
THAT THE WE'D THERE IS A HOUSING

01:33:42.083 --> 01:33:44.252 region:rollup2
CRISIS HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN

01:33:43.785 --> 01:33:45.753 region:rollup2
FACT.

01:33:44.252 --> 01:33:46.988 region:rollup2
IT'S ESTIMATED THAT WE NEED

01:33:45.753 --> 01:33:49.057 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE HUNDRED THOUSAND ONE

01:33:46.988 --> 01:33:50.792 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW UNITS EVERY

01:33:49.057 --> 01:33:52.861 region:rollup2
YEAR JUST TO MEET THE DEMANDS.

01:33:50.792 --> 01:33:54.329 region:rollup2
THAT WE FACE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:33:52.861 --> 01:33:57.232 region:rollup2
WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT

01:33:54.329 --> 01:33:59.567 region:rollup2
THE RENTS HERE IN THE STATE.

01:33:57.232 --> 01:34:01.102 region:rollup2
ARE GETTING OUT OF CONTROL ON IN

01:33:59.567 --> 01:34:01.636 region:rollup2
FACT THE AVERAGE SHELL AMOUNT

01:34:01.102 --> 01:34:03.738 region:rollup2
RENT.

01:34:01.636 --> 01:34:05.073 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES

01:34:03.738 --> 01:34:06.374 region:rollup2
A.

01:34:05.073 --> 01:34:07.141 region:rollup2
OTHER DEPARTMENT OF URBAN

01:34:06.374 --> 01:34:09.611 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

01:34:07.141 --> 01:34:11.346 region:rollup2
IS AROUND THIRTEEN HUNDRED.

01:34:09.611 --> 01:34:12.580 region:rollup2
DOLLARS A MONTH.

01:34:11.346 --> 01:34:14.816 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS THE SECOND HIGHEST

01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:17.185 region:rollup2
IN THE NATION.

01:34:14.816 --> 01:34:19.154 region:rollup2
AND AS WE HEARD FROM THE CHAIR

01:34:17.185 --> 01:34:20.955 region:rollup2
AND THE AUTHOR IN. A MANY OF YOU

01:34:19.154 --> 01:34:22.023 region:rollup2
EARLIER.

01:34:20.955 --> 01:34:22.557 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE FULLY

01:34:22.023 --> 01:34:24.092 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDS THE IMPACTS OF

01:34:22.557 --> 01:34:26.294 region:rollup2
THESE.

01:34:24.092 --> 01:34:29.430 region:rollup2
PHENOMENA ARE HAVING.

01:34:26.294 --> 01:34:31.099 region:rollup2
ON THE RESIDENTS IN THE STATE.

01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:33.568 region:rollup2
WHICH IS ALSO A REASON WHY IN

01:34:31.099 --> 01:34:35.103 region:rollup2
THE PAST LEGISLATORS CYCLE WE

01:34:33.568 --> 01:34:35.870 region:rollup2
PASSED A TOTAL OF FIFTEEN

01:34:35.103 --> 01:34:38.406 region:rollup2
HOUSING BILLS AS MISSION.

01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:39.240 region:rollup2
EARLIER.

01:34:38.406 --> 01:34:40.508 region:rollup2
AND BUT AWARENESS PUT ALL

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:43.578 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN OF THEM.

01:34:40.508 --> 01:34:44.145 region:rollup2
OUR. IT WAS.

01:34:43.578 --> 01:34:46.147 region:rollup2
NEVERTHELESS JUST ONE STEP

01:34:44.145 --> 01:34:47.282 region:rollup2
TOWARDS.

01:34:46.147 --> 01:34:49.117 region:rollup2
THESE VERY PRESSING ISSUES THAT

01:34:47.282 --> 01:34:49.984 region:rollup2
WE FACE.

01:34:49.117 --> 01:34:52.987 region:rollup2
WE'LL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO LOOK

01:34:49.984 --> 01:34:54.889 region:rollup2
FOR SOLUTIONS AS WE GO.

01:34:52.987 --> 01:34:56.624 region:rollup2
TRUE QUESTION BECOMES WHETHER

01:34:54.889 --> 01:35:00.195 region:rollup2
EXPANDING RENT CONTROL IN THE

01:34:56.624 --> 01:35:02.397 region:rollup2
STATE IS YET ANOTHER SOLUTION.

01:35:00.195 --> 01:35:03.498 region:rollup2
I MUST ADMIT THAT TOPPING THE

01:35:02.397 --> 01:35:06.334 region:rollup2
RENT IN SOME SITUATIONS MAY

01:35:03.498 --> 01:35:07.669 region:rollup2
APPEAR.

01:35:06.334 --> 01:35:10.038 region:rollup2
TO CONTROL THE UPTAKE IN RAN. IN

01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:12.440 region:rollup2
CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS.

01:35:10.038 --> 01:35:13.641 region:rollup2
YET IN THE LONG RUN.

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:15.977 region:rollup2
I WE SOLVING THE PROBLEM. I

01:35:13.641 --> 01:35:17.946 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WAS BEEN RACED.

01:35:15.977 --> 01:35:20.181 region:rollup2
I MEAN FIRST OF ALL POINT TO THE

01:35:17.946 --> 01:35:22.483 region:rollup2
VERY RECENT STUDY IN THAT'S THE

01:35:20.181 --> 01:35:24.285 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIXTEEN STUDY THAT WAS.

01:35:22.483 --> 01:35:26.554 region:rollup2
ARE DISCUSSED EARLIER BY THE

01:35:24.285 --> 01:35:28.022 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST.

01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:30.692 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A NONPARTISAN NON

01:35:28.022 --> 01:35:32.126 region:rollup2
BIASED ANTI THAT WE. IN FACT

01:35:30.692 --> 01:35:34.662 region:rollup2
OFTEN LOOK TO THAT I OFTEN LOOK

01:35:32.126 --> 01:35:36.764 region:rollup2
TO.

01:35:34.662 --> 01:35:38.399 region:rollup2
THEIR CONCLUSION. AS LATE AS

01:35:36.764 --> 01:35:40.368 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIXTEEN.

01:35:38.399 --> 01:35:41.669 region:rollup2
WAS THAT RIGHT CONTROL IS NOT

01:35:40.368 --> 01:35:43.004 region:rollup2
LETME UNDERSCORE IS NOT A

01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:45.940 region:rollup2
VEHICLE. TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING

01:35:43.004 --> 01:35:48.443 region:rollup2
CRISIS.

01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:50.144 region:rollup2
NOW SOME OF ITS FINDINGS IN FACT

01:35:48.443 --> 01:35:52.080 region:rollup2
COINCIDE WITH MANY OF THE

01:35:50.144 --> 01:35:53.381 region:rollup2
STUDIES OUT THERE CONDUCTED BY

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:56.251 region:rollup2
ECONOMISTS I THINK WE TALK ABOUT

01:35:53.381 --> 01:35:58.486 region:rollup2
ECONOMIST EARLIER.

01:35:56.251 --> 01:36:00.455 region:rollup2
WHICH INDICATES SAID EXPANDING

01:35:58.486 --> 01:36:01.956 region:rollup2
NOW EXPANDING RANKED ROLE.

01:36:00.455 --> 01:36:03.925 region:rollup2
HOOKS ACTUALLY EXACERBATE THE

01:36:01.956 --> 01:36:04.792 region:rollup2
HOUSING SITUATION.

01:36:03.925 --> 01:36:06.427 region:rollup2
THIS INCENTIVIZE NEW

01:36:04.792 --> 01:36:07.829 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION.

01:36:06.427 --> 01:36:08.863 region:rollup2
BECAUSE DILAPIDATED HOUSING

01:36:07.829 --> 01:36:10.798 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS BE DUE TO LACK OF

01:36:08.863 --> 01:36:12.200 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE.

01:36:10.798 --> 01:36:13.901 region:rollup2
AND MAY EVEN DISCOURAGE

01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:16.104 region:rollup2
HOUSEHOLDS FROM MOVING. TO

01:36:13.901 --> 01:36:18.973 region:rollup2
MARKET RATE HOUSING WHERE IT MAY

01:36:16.104 --> 01:36:21.042 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE BENEFIT THEM.

01:36:18.973 --> 01:36:22.443 region:rollup2
IN FACT THE LA ILL ALSO SAYS

01:36:21.042 --> 01:36:23.978 region:rollup2
THAT MARKET RATE HOUSING

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:26.748 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION APPEARS TO BE

01:36:23.978 --> 01:36:28.983 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED. ASSOCIATED WITH LESS

01:36:26.748 --> 01:36:30.718 region:rollup2
LESS DISPLACEMENT.

01:36:28.983 --> 01:36:33.388 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF THE COMMUNITIES

01:36:30.718 --> 01:36:34.288 region:rollup2
INCLUSIONARY HOUSING POLICY.

01:36:33.388 --> 01:36:36.457 region:rollup2
WE TALKED ABOUT THAT ALSO

01:36:34.288 --> 01:36:38.760 region:rollup2
DISPLACEMENT.

01:36:36.457 --> 01:36:39.794 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:41.596 region:rollup2
AS WE ALL KNOW ON THE CURRENT

01:36:39.794 --> 01:36:43.064 region:rollup2
LAW IT'S BEEN MENTIONED.

01:36:41.596 --> 01:36:44.799 region:rollup2
CITIES ALREADY HAVE THE

01:36:43.064 --> 01:36:46.601 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY TO ADOPT RENT CONTROL.

01:36:44.799 --> 01:36:48.636 region:rollup2
YES.

01:36:46.601 --> 01:36:49.637 region:rollup2
UNDER THE MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED

01:36:48.636 --> 01:36:51.739 region:rollup2
EIGHTY CITIES HERE IN THE STATE

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:53.441 region:rollup2
OF CAIFORNIA. ONLY FIFTEEN OF

01:36:51.739 --> 01:36:54.909 region:rollup2
THEM FIFTEEN.

01:36:53.441 --> 01:36:59.547 region:rollup2
HAVE RENT CONTROL AND THAT'S

01:36:54.909 --> 01:37:01.549 region:rollup2
LIKE THREE PERCENT.

01:36:59.547 --> 01:37:03.084 region:rollup2
LIFTING COSTA HAWKINS

01:37:01.549 --> 01:37:05.053 region:rollup2
MAY INDEED HELP SOME CITIES AND

01:37:03.084 --> 01:37:06.320 region:rollup2
SOME RESIDENTS.

01:37:05.053 --> 01:37:09.857 region:rollup2
BUT IT MAY ALSO HURT OTHERS

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:11.426 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME.

01:37:09.857 --> 01:37:12.026 region:rollup2
JUST YESTERDAY AYE I RECEIVED AN

01:37:11.426 --> 01:37:13.995 region:rollup2
EMAIL FROM A SEVENTY FIVE YEAR

01:37:12.026 --> 01:37:16.064 region:rollup2
OLD.

01:37:13.995 --> 01:37:18.933 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS WHO RAISED TWO

01:37:16.064 --> 01:37:21.402 region:rollup2
CHILDREN AS A SINGLE MOTHER.

01:37:18.933 --> 01:37:23.538 region:rollup2
WHO REALIZE ON INCOME FROM A

01:37:21.402 --> 01:37:25.873 region:rollup2
VERY SMALL INVESTMENT PROPERTY?

01:37:23.538 --> 01:37:27.542 region:rollup2
AS HER LIVELIHOOD.

01:37:25.873 --> 01:37:29.477 region:rollup2
SHE SAID THAT SHE NEEDS THE

01:37:27.542 --> 01:37:31.045 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO CHARGE MARKET RATE.

01:37:29.477 --> 01:37:32.447 region:rollup2
AGAIN MARKET RATE.

01:37:31.045 --> 01:37:34.182 region:rollup2
TO PAY FOR.

01:37:32.447 --> 01:37:36.851 region:rollup2
HER MORTGAGES

01:37:34.182 --> 01:37:38.119 region:rollup2
HER INSURANCE THE PROPERTY TAX

01:37:36.851 --> 01:37:38.920 region:rollup2
UTILITIES IMPROVEMENTS AND

01:37:38.119 --> 01:37:40.922 region:rollup2
REPAIRS

01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:43.191 region:rollup2
JUST TO KEEP.

01:37:40.922 --> 01:37:45.259 region:rollup2
THE RENTAL PROPERTY.

01:37:43.191 --> 01:37:47.528 region:rollup2
ALSO SHE DOES NOT RECEIVE ANY

01:37:45.259 --> 01:37:49.564 region:rollup2
RETIREMENT BENEFITS BENEFITS

01:37:47.528 --> 01:37:50.465 region:rollup2
FROM HER DECEASED HUSBAND.

01:37:49.564 --> 01:37:52.800 region:rollup2
BUT THIS BILL WILL COMPLETELY

01:37:50.465 --> 01:37:53.334 region:rollup2
CHANGE THAT.

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:54.769 region:rollup2
AND SHE'S ONE OF THE MANY

01:37:53.334 --> 01:37:55.837 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES

01:37:54.769 --> 01:37:58.606 region:rollup2
IN MY DISTRICT AS WELL AS

01:37:55.837 --> 01:38:00.341 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.

01:37:58.606 --> 01:38:05.380 region:rollup2
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE CONSIDER

01:38:00.341 --> 01:38:07.515 region:rollup2
ALL ASPECTS WHEN WE PASS A LAW.

01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:08.082 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT A COMPLETE REPEAL A

01:38:07.515 --> 01:38:10.251 region:rollup2
COMPLETE REPEAL OF A TWENTY

01:38:08.082 --> 01:38:13.154 region:rollup2
YEAR.

01:38:10.251 --> 01:38:16.023 region:rollup2
OLD LAW. MAY HAVE IN FACT SOME

01:38:13.154 --> 01:38:17.792 region:rollup2
ADVERSE IMPACTS ON THE OVERALL

01:38:16.023 --> 01:38:19.360 region:rollup2
HOUSING SITUATION AND ON THE

01:38:17.792 --> 01:38:20.294 region:rollup2
VERY RESIDENTS THAT THE LAW IS

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:23.531 region:rollup2
INTENDED.

01:38:20.294 --> 01:38:25.333 region:rollup2
TO BENEFIT.

01:38:23.531 --> 01:38:27.401 region:rollup2
NO I WAS OPEN AND I HAVE BEEN

01:38:25.333 --> 01:38:29.537 region:rollup2
OPEN.

01:38:27.401 --> 01:38:31.305 region:rollup2
TO MEETING INCREMENTAL CHANGES.

01:38:29.537 --> 01:38:34.041 region:rollup2
TO THE EXISTING LAW.

01:38:31.305 --> 01:38:36.010 region:rollup2
NAMELY COSTA HAWKINS.

01:38:34.041 --> 01:38:38.212 region:rollup2
AND AS WE KNOW THE LAW HS THREE

01:38:36.010 --> 01:38:39.313 region:rollup2
MAJOR COMPONENTS.

01:38:38.212 --> 01:38:41.682 region:rollup2
SINGLE FAMILY HOMES THEY

01:38:39.313 --> 01:38:43.584 region:rollup2
CONCEDED CONTROL.

01:38:41.682 --> 01:38:44.952 region:rollup2
AND NEW BUILDINGS ARE NEW HOMES.

01:38:43.584 --> 01:38:48.122 region:rollup2
AND WAS OPEN TO BASICALLY

01:38:44.952 --> 01:38:49.524 region:rollup2
TWEAKING ANY PART OF THAT.

01:38:48.122 --> 01:38:53.094 region:rollup2
WE CAN ALSO DO A PILOT PROJECT

01:38:49.524 --> 01:38:54.629 region:rollup2
FOR CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS.

01:38:53.094 --> 01:38:55.663 region:rollup2
YET.

01:38:54.629 --> 01:38:58.132 region:rollup2
IT UP IT'S A LITTLE

01:38:55.663 --> 01:39:00.768 region:rollup2
DISAPPOINTING TO HEAR THAT NEAR

01:38:58.132 --> 01:39:02.170 region:rollup2
SIGH. HAVE MADE ANY CONCESSIONS

LAST YEAR.

SO PLEASE SAID A COMPLETE REPEAL

01:39:09.010 --> 01:39:11.813 region:rollup2
WITHOUT A REPLACEMENT A BACK UP

01:39:10.478 --> 01:39:14.449 region:rollup2
PLAN IS JUST TOO RISKY.

01:39:11.813 --> 01:39:23.324 region:rollup2
ON MY BOOKS.

01:39:14.449 --> 01:39:23.958 region:rollup2
SO I'M JUST GOING.

01:39:23.324 --> 01:39:26.994 region:rollup2

WITNESSES AS WELL AS OF THE BILL

01:40:07.101 --> 01:40:10.771 region:rollup2
AUTHORED THIS HAS BEEN A A

01:40:08.603 --> 01:40:11.506 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT DISCUSSION. OF IT AND

01:40:10.771 --> 01:40:12.740 region:rollup2
LET ME SAY I THINK EVERYONE

01:40:11.506 --> 01:40:14.642 region:rollup2
KNOWS WHERE MY PERSPECTIVE IS AS

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:16.110 region:rollup2
I SAID EARLIER I AM A CO AUTHOR

01:40:14.642 --> 01:40:18.746 region:rollup2
OF OF THIS BILL.

01:40:16.110 --> 01:40:20.715 region:rollup2
I WANT TO HE APPRECIATE THAT

01:40:18.746 --> 01:40:22.216 region:rollup2
THE THAT. THE ISSUES AND BEEN

01:40:20.715 --> 01:40:23.184 region:rollup2
RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION AND

01:40:22.216 --> 01:40:25.186 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY.

01:40:23.184 --> 01:40:26.621 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE AGREEMENT ON ON

01:40:25.186 --> 01:40:28.089 region:rollup2
ON ON SOME OF THAT AND AND

01:40:26.621 --> 01:40:28.756 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSION AROUND

01:40:28.089 --> 01:40:31.058 region:rollup2
WHETHER THIS WILL.

01:40:28.756 --> 01:40:32.793 region:rollup2
A REPEAL EXCLUDE NEW

01:40:31.058 --> 01:40:34.195 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION AND I WOULD JUST

01:40:32.793 --> 01:40:36.197 region:rollup2
NOTICE WAS SAID BEFORE JUST IN

01:40:34.195 --> 01:40:38.533 region:rollup2
THE BAY AREA. OUT WE'VE SEEN IN

01:40:36.197 --> 01:40:39.333 region:rollup2
RECENT YEARS HALF OF NEW

01:40:38.533 --> 01:40:41.535 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION

01:40:39.333 --> 01:40:43.237 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE IN RENT

01:40:41.535 --> 01:40:43.804 region:rollup2
CONTROL JURISDICTIONS EVEN

01:40:43.237 --> 01:40:45.539 region:rollup2
THOUGH THOSE RENT CONTROLLED

01:40:43.804 --> 01:40:46.908 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIONS ONLY. OCCUPY A

01:40:45.539 --> 01:40:48.409 region:rollup2
SMALL PERCENTAGE OF LAND IN THE

01:40:46.908 --> 01:40:49.577 region:rollup2
BAY AREA WHILE MANY

01:40:48.409 --> 01:40:51.212 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS IN THE BAY AREA

01:40:49.577 --> 01:40:52.847 region:rollup2
THAT DO NOT HAVE RENT CONTROL.

01:40:51.212 --> 01:40:54.315 region:rollup2
HAVE SEEN ZERO CONSTRUCT

01:40:52.847 --> 01:40:55.349 region:rollup2
AND AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING

01:40:54.315 --> 01:40:56.617 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO GRAPPLE WITH. I

01:40:55.349 --> 01:40:56.851 region:rollup2
KNOW THERE'S BEEN A DISCUSSION

01:40:56.617 --> 01:40:58.819 region:rollup2
AROUND.

01:40:56.851 --> 01:41:00.354 region:rollup2
ACANCY DE CONTROL I THINK IT'S

01:40:58.819 --> 01:41:01.822 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT NOTE THAT WHEN.

01:41:00.354 --> 01:41:03.624 region:rollup2
RENT CONTROL.

01:41:01.822 --> 01:41:04.191 region:rollup2
WAS BEING DEBATED IN THE

01:41:03.624 --> 01:41:04.992 region:rollup2
NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND EARLY

01:41:04.191 --> 01:41:06.494 region:rollup2
EIGHTIES.

01:41:04.992 --> 01:41:08.095 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE CITIES DECIDED TO

01:41:06.494 --> 01:41:10.565 region:rollup2
MOVE FOR THE VACANCY TO CONTROL

01:41:08.095 --> 01:41:11.532 region:rollup2
MANY DID NOT. ARE AND THOSE THAT

01:41:10.565 --> 01:41:13.367 region:rollup2
DID.

01:41:11.532 --> 01:41:15.269 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY JUST

01:41:13.367 --> 01:41:16.938 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE IN SANTA MONICA UP

01:41:15.269 --> 01:41:19.240 region:rollup2
WHEN VACANCY DE CONTROL WAS

01:41:16.938 --> 01:41:20.775 region:rollup2
IMPOSED IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE

01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:22.910 region:rollup2
WITH COSTA HAWKINS.

01:41:20.775 --> 01:41:24.946 region:rollup2
YOU SAW AFFORDABILITY IN CITIES

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:26.547 region:rollup2
LIKE SANTA MONICA GO FROM.

01:41:24.946 --> 01:41:28.049 region:rollup2
EIGHTY THREE PERCENT DOWN TO

01:41:26.547 --> 01:41:30.518 region:rollup2
FOUR PERCENT ONE VACANCY DE

01:41:28.049 --> 01:41:31.118 region:rollup2
CONTROL CAME AND SO AGAIN IT'S A

01:41:30.518 --> 01:41:32.320 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION THAT THAT WE NEED

01:41:31.118 --> 01:41:34.488 region:rollup2
TO HAVE.

01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:36.190 region:rollup2
I DO HAVE REALLY TWO QUESTIONS

01:41:34.488 --> 01:41:37.692 region:rollup2
TO THE OPPOSITION.

01:41:36.190 --> 01:41:39.560 region:rollup2
I THINK WE ALL AGREE AS MS

01:41:37.692 --> 01:41:41.195 region:rollup2
CARLTON AND MY COLLEAGUE MISTER

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:43.631 region:rollup2
BLOOM UPSET WE ALL AGREE WE NEED

01:41:41.195 --> 01:41:45.600 region:rollup2
TO BUILD MORE HOUSING.

01:41:43.631 --> 01:41:47.702 region:rollup2
IF WE HAD MORE HOUSING TODAY. IF

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:48.970 region:rollup2
RENTS WERE STABLE WE WOULD NOT

01:41:47.702 --> 01:41:50.638 region:rollup2
HAVE THIS DISCUSSION BUT AS

01:41:48.970 --> 01:41:52.406 region:rollup2
MISTER BLOOM POINTED OUT. ON

01:41:50.638 --> 01:41:54.141 region:rollup2
EVEN IF WE DO ALL THE THINGS

01:41:52.406 --> 01:41:55.910 region:rollup2
THAT WE WANT TO DO FROM LAST

01:41:54.141 --> 01:41:57.078 region:rollup2
YEAR THIS YEAR BEYOND. OUR TO

01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:58.112 region:rollup2
ENSURE MORE HOUSING IT WILL TAKE

01:41:57.078 --> 01:42:00.114 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:41:58.112 --> 01:42:01.148 region:rollup2
TO PUT HOUSING.

01:42:00.114 --> 01:42:02.984 region:rollup2
ON THE GROUND TO HAVE IT BUILT

01:42:01.148 --> 01:42:06.020 region:rollup2
TO HAVE FOLKS HOUSE.

01:42:02.984 --> 01:42:08.389 region:rollup2
AND SO WE HAVE A CRISIS TO DAY.

01:42:06.020 --> 01:42:10.291 region:rollup2
WE'VE A CRISIS OF NOW.

01:42:08.389 --> 01:42:11.425 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF TENANTS WHO

01:42:10.291 --> 01:42:12.760 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN AFFECTED AND WHO WERE

01:42:11.425 --> 01:42:14.662 region:rollup2
BEING EVICTED AND THEY ARE OUR

01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:16.230 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORS.

01:42:14.662 --> 01:42:17.665 region:rollup2
THEY ARE OUR FRIENDS THEIR

01:42:16.230 --> 01:42:19.066 region:rollup2
FAMILIES THEY ARE FOLKS WHO ARE

01:42:17.665 --> 01:42:22.436 region:rollup2
HERE IN THIS ROOM.

01:42:19.066 --> 01:42:24.071 region:rollup2
AND AND WITH THE URGENCY OF NOW.

01:42:22.436 --> 01:42:26.307 region:rollup2
MY QUESTION TO THE OPPOSITION IS

01:42:24.071 --> 01:42:29.243 region:rollup2
IF NOT THIS.

01:42:26.307 --> 01:42:30.611 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD YOU PROPOSE TO DAY

01:42:29.243 --> 01:42:32.213 region:rollup2
THAT WE COULD GET DONE TODAY TO

01:42:30.611 --> 01:42:33.180 region:rollup2
PREVENT?

01:42:32.213 --> 01:42:35.650 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF TENANTS FROM BEING

01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:36.450 region:rollup2
EVICTED.

01:42:35.650 --> 01:42:37.284 region:rollup2
MILLIONS A CALIFORNIANS FOM

01:42:36.450 --> 01:42:40.488 region:rollup2
BEING.

01:42:37.284 --> 01:42:41.722 region:rollup2
HOUSING UNSTABLE.

01:42:40.488 --> 01:42:43.024 region:rollup2
THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION.

01:42:41.722 --> 01:42:44.792 region:rollup2
IN YOU KNOW WHAT'S WHAT'S

01:42:43.024 --> 01:42:46.560 region:rollup2
FASCINATING IS IS WE HAVEN'T SAT

01:42:44.792 --> 01:42:47.862 region:rollup2
DOWN TO TALK ABOUT A COMPROMISE.

01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:49.363 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THE MOST MOST

01:42:47.862 --> 01:42:50.264 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATE PART IS THAT WE'VE

01:42:49.363 --> 01:42:51.632 region:rollup2
BEEN THREATENED WITH AN

01:42:50.264 --> 01:42:54.001 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE RIGHT.

01:42:51.632 --> 01:42:55.569 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE PROPONENTS THERE HAS

01:42:54.001 --> 01:42:57.038 region:rollup2
BEEN A PROPONENT OF STOPPING ALL

01:42:55.569 --> 01:42:59.073 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

01:42:57.038 --> 01:43:01.242 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF LOS ANGELES.

01:42:59.073 --> 01:43:01.942 region:rollup2
IT'S TRUE AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE

01:43:01.242 --> 01:43:03.044 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK.

01:43:01.942 --> 01:43:05.746 region:rollup2
WE ARE NOT.

01:43:03.044 --> 01:43:07.214 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO TALKING ABOUT

01:43:05.746 --> 01:43:08.983 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT OPTIONS

01:43:07.214 --> 01:43:10.384 region:rollup2
BUT ON THE TABLE AGAIN

01:43:08.983 --> 01:43:12.887 region:rollup2
THREATENING US A LOOMING IS AN

01:43:10.384 --> 01:43:14.221 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE AND THAT JUST

01:43:12.887 --> 01:43:15.623 region:rollup2
ANYTHING WE DO HERE THE

01:43:14.221 --> 01:43:18.426 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

01:43:15.623 --> 01:43:21.095 region:rollup2
WILL BE OVER RIDDEN POTENTIALLY.

01:43:18.426 --> 01:43:22.430 region:rollup2
BY A STATE INITIATIVE OF COURSE

01:43:21.095 --> 01:43:23.764 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY'S GONNA THROW MILLIONS

01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:25.299 region:rollup2
pOF DOLLARS AND SPEND A LOT OF

01:43:23.764 --> 01:43:27.234 region:rollup2
TIME AND INITIATIVE AND THAT'S

01:43:25.299 --> 01:43:28.736 region:rollup2
VERYUNFORTUNATE. SO I WOULD SAY

01:43:27.234 --> 01:43:30.671 region:rollup2
WE ARE NOTADVERSE TO TALKING

01:43:28.736 --> 01:43:31.672 region:rollup2
ABOUT COMPROMISES AND WE STAND

01:43:30.671 --> 01:43:33.074 region:rollup2
READY TO SIT AT THE TABLE AND

01:43:31.672 --> 01:43:34.108 region:rollup2
TALK. BUT AT THIS POINT YOU'RE

01:43:33.074 --> 01:43:35.910 region:rollup2
NOT WILLING TO SAY ANYTHING

01:43:34.108 --> 01:43:38.212 region:rollup2
PUBLICLY ABOUT IDEAS I COULD

01:43:35.910 --> 01:43:39.080 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE EVICTION COARSER

01:43:38.212 --> 01:43:40.481 region:rollup2
SENATE DEMOCRATS AS WELL. AYE

01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:41.348 region:rollup2
I'M TRULY JUST ASKING THE

01:43:40.481 --> 01:43:42.783 region:rollup2
QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK

01:43:41.348 --> 01:43:44.852 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY WE'VE COLLEAGUES LIKE

01:43:42.783 --> 01:43:46.821 region:rollup2
MR CHOW YEAH WHO AND PROBABLY

01:43:44.852 --> 01:43:49.724 region:rollup2
OTHERS THAT WOULD BE WILLING. TO

01:43:46.821 --> 01:43:51.292 region:rollup2
CONSIDER COSTA HAWKINS REFORM IF

01:43:49.724 --> 01:43:52.293 region:rollup2
THEIR IDEAS ON THE TABLE BUT AT

01:43:51.292 --> 01:43:53.761 region:rollup2
THIS MOMENT THERE ARE NO AND

01:43:52.293 --> 01:43:55.529 region:rollup2
THAT IS ENTERED IT I GET IT AND

01:43:53.761 --> 01:43:56.530 region:rollup2
THAT'S FAIR IN FACT. LAST YEAR

01:43:55.529 --> 01:43:58.232 region:rollup2
WE COMPROMISED.

01:43:56.530 --> 01:43:59.400 region:rollup2
ON INCLUSIONARY ZONING SO WE

01:43:58.232 --> 01:44:00.501 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:02.670 region:rollup2
CLEARED IT UP THE LOCAL

01:44:00.501 --> 01:44:04.672 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS COULD ALLOW FOR

01:44:02.670 --> 01:44:05.539 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING OF ALL NEW

01:44:04.672 --> 01:44:07.041 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION.

01:44:05.539 --> 01:44:08.676 region:rollup2
THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT

01:44:07.041 --> 01:44:10.111 region:rollup2
COMPONENT OF THE COMPROMISE THAT

01:44:08.676 --> 01:44:12.113 region:rollup2
WE DID LAST YEAR.

01:44:10.111 --> 01:44:13.247 region:rollup2
AND I.

01:44:12.113 --> 01:44:15.182 region:rollup2
I I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT

01:44:13.247 --> 01:44:16.684 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT IS.

01:44:15.182 --> 01:44:19.253 region:rollup2
NEW CONSTRUCTION.

01:44:16.684 --> 01:44:20.888 region:rollup2
RENT CONTROL.

01:44:19.253 --> 01:44:22.656 region:rollup2
SO MEASURES LIKE THAT ARE

01:44:20.888 --> 01:44:24.992 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY SOMETHING AGAIN THAT

01:44:22.656 --> 01:44:26.127 region:rollup2
WE STAND READY TO TALK ABOUT.

01:44:24.992 --> 01:44:27.495 region:rollup2
AND THEN ONE AND THIS IS A BIT

01:44:26.127 --> 01:44:29.063 region:rollup2
MORE OF A DETAILED QUESTION BUT

01:44:27.495 --> 01:44:30.598 region:rollup2
ONE ASPECT OF OF COSTA HAWKINS

01:44:29.063 --> 01:44:31.732 region:rollup2
THAT I HAVE HAD.

01:44:30.598 --> 01:44:33.701 region:rollup2
SERIOUS ISSUES WITH OVER THE

01:44:31.732 --> 01:44:36.103 region:rollup2
YEARS IS THE FACT THAT THERE'S A

01:44:33.701 --> 01:44:38.405 region:rollup2
A DATE LIMITTION. ARE AFTER

01:44:36.103 --> 01:44:40.040 region:rollup2
WHICH NEW CONSTRUCTION CANNOT

01:44:38.405 --> 01:44:41.809 region:rollup2
HAVE RENT CONTROL APPLY TO IT SO

01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:43.144 region:rollup2
ARE AS OF NINETEEN NINETY FIVE

01:44:41.809 --> 01:44:44.111 region:rollup2
ALL LAWS THAT HAD BEEN ON THE

01:44:43.144 --> 01:44:45.546 region:rollup2
BOOKS SO FOR EXAMPLE MY CITY IN

01:44:44.111 --> 01:44:47.081 region:rollup2
NINETEEN

01:44:45.546 --> 01:44:48.249 region:rollup2
OF THE NINE OR MANY OTHERS IN.

01:44:47.081 --> 01:44:49.483 region:rollup2
OF THE LATE SEVENTIES TO THE

01:44:48.249 --> 01:44:51.318 region:rollup2
EARLY EIGHTIES NO NEW

01:44:49.483 --> 01:44:52.720 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION AFTER SAY NINETEEN

01:44:51.318 --> 01:44:54.588 region:rollup2
SEVENTY NINE IN SAN FRANCISCO

01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:56.323 region:rollup2
COULD HAVE WRECKAGE APPLY TO IT.

01:44:54.588 --> 01:44:57.825 region:rollup2
WE ARE NOW MOST FORTY YEARS FROM

01:44:56.323 --> 01:44:59.260 region:rollup2
THAT AND THAT IS MEANT FORTY

01:44:57.825 --> 01:45:01.162 region:rollup2
YEARS OF CONSTRUCTION AND SAN

01:44:59.260 --> 01:45:02.563 region:rollup2
FRANCISCO AND AGAIN YOU CAN.

01:45:01.162 --> 01:45:03.597 region:rollup2
PICK YOUR CITY AND ONE RANKING

01:45:02.563 --> 01:45:04.865 region:rollup2
JEWEL MIGHT OF APPLIED.

01:45:03.597 --> 01:45:07.067 region:rollup2
ARE NO LONGER SUBJECT TO RENT

01:45:04.865 --> 01:45:08.435 region:rollup2
CONTROL. WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT

01:45:07.067 --> 01:45:09.470 region:rollup2
MY?

01:45:08.435 --> 01:45:11.705 region:rollup2
TODDLER WHO'S ALMOST TWO YEARS

01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:14.275 region:rollup2
OLD BY THE TIME HE IS AN ADULT

01:45:11.705 --> 01:45:16.377 region:rollup2
SEEN AS THIRTIES. WE COULD SEE

01:45:14.275 --> 01:45:19.013 region:rollup2
RENT CONTROL STARK.

01:45:16.377 --> 01:45:20.815 region:rollup2
DWINDLE BE DEMOLISHED AND

01:45:19.013 --> 01:45:22.783 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY AND AND AND AND AT

01:45:20.815 --> 01:45:24.418 region:rollup2
SOME POINT RANK CONTROL IF IF

01:45:22.783 --> 01:45:25.286 region:rollup2
COSTA HAWKINS DOESN'T CHANGE IN

01:45:24.418 --> 01:45:26.887 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE.

01:45:25.286 --> 01:45:29.590 region:rollup2
THE WRECKAGE WAS TALKING

01:45:26.887 --> 01:45:32.193 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WILL DISAPPEAR.

01:45:29.590 --> 01:45:33.828 region:rollup2
I AND IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT

01:45:32.193 --> 01:45:35.896 region:rollup2
THAT IS WHERE WHAT YOU SUPPORT

01:45:33.828 --> 01:45:36.864 region:rollup2
THAT RENT CONTROL IN ALL THE

01:45:35.896 --> 01:45:38.232 region:rollup2
CITIES IT EVEN CURRENTLY HAVE A

01:45:36.864 --> 01:45:39.300 region:rollup2
CONTROL. THAT THAT RENT CONTROL

01:45:38.232 --> 01:45:40.834 region:rollup2
STOCK SHOULD SHOULD NO LONGER

01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:41.936 region:rollup2
EXIST.

01:45:40.834 --> 01:45:43.337 region:rollup2
WE A RIGHT I DON'T THINK WE WANT

01:45:41.936 --> 01:45:44.205 region:rollup2
OUR KIDS MOVING BACK HOME WITH

01:45:43.337 --> 01:45:45.239 region:rollup2
US DO WE AND I THINK THAT'S ONE

01:45:44.205 --> 01:45:46.740 region:rollup2
HUNDRED CHALLENGES E WANT THEM

01:45:45.239 --> 01:45:48.876 region:rollup2
TO HAVE A LIFE.

01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:51.846 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO

01:45:48.876 --> 01:45:53.547 region:rollup2
THOSE PROVIDE ASSURANCES.

01:45:51.846 --> 01:45:55.182 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE A NEW CONSTRUCTION

01:45:53.547 --> 01:45:56.584 region:rollup2
WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN YOU

01:45:55.182 --> 01:45:57.885 region:rollup2
CONSTANTLY CHANGE THE DATE.

01:45:56.584 --> 01:46:00.821 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOTTA FIND A WAY TO

01:45:57.885 --> 01:46:02.556 region:rollup2
PROVIDE SOME ASSURANCES.

01:46:00.821 --> 01:46:05.025 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE WHO ARE BUILDING NEW

01:46:02.556 --> 01:46:07.194 region:rollup2
HOUSING IF WE JUST LEAVE IT WIDE

01:46:05.025 --> 01:46:09.964 region:rollup2
OPEN. A FOR EVERY JOB LOCAL

01:46:07.194 --> 01:46:12.533 region:rollup2
JURISDICTION TO MAKE THEIR OWN

01:46:09.964 --> 01:46:13.834 region:rollup2
CALL ON WHETHER IT'S BELOW. CP I

01:46:12.533 --> 01:46:15.502 region:rollup2
THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX THAT

01:46:13.834 --> 01:46:17.171 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HELP.

01:46:15.502 --> 01:46:18.606 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW. WHERE

01:46:17.171 --> 01:46:20.374 region:rollup2
IS THE POINT AT WHICH WE WILL

01:46:18.606 --> 01:46:22.409 region:rollup2
STOP AND WILL WE CONTINUALLY

01:46:20.374 --> 01:46:23.844 region:rollup2
MOVE THAT MARKER? IF WE COULD

01:46:22.409 --> 01:46:25.479 region:rollup2
FIND A WAY TO SAY WHAT THAT

01:46:23.844 --> 01:46:26.046 region:rollup2
MEANS I THINK THAT WOULD HELP

01:46:25.479 --> 01:46:27.848 region:rollup2
AND IT WOULD HELP WITH NEW

01:46:26.046 --> 01:46:29.550 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION SO WHILE THAT'S NOT

01:46:27.848 --> 01:46:31.118 region:rollup2
A FIRM ANSWER. I THINK WHAT IT

01:46:29.550 --> 01:46:31.986 region:rollup2
IS IS A WAY FOR US TO COME TO

01:46:31.118 --> 01:46:34.121 region:rollup2
THE TABLE TO TALK.

01:46:31.986 --> 01:46:34.521 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:46:34.121 --> 01:46:36.190 region:rollup2
AND WITH THAT.

01:46:34.521 --> 01:46:37.191 region:rollup2
IT MISTER BLOOM D. OF ANY FINAL

01:46:36.190 --> 01:46:38.392 region:rollup2
COMMENTS YOU WANNA MAKE AN

01:46:37.191 --> 01:46:40.361 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE OR THE PUBLIC AREA

I'LL JUST A RESPOND BRIEFLY TO

01:46:40.361 --> 01:46:43.464 region:rollup2

01:46:41.862 --> 01:46:45.199 region:rollup2
WE'VE HEARD AND AND EXPRESS MY

01:46:43.464 --> 01:46:46.900 region:rollup2

TO THE OPENING CA.

01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:50.371 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM

01:46:48.269 --> 01:46:51.739 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION TO HAVE A DIALOGUE

01:46:50.371 --> 01:46:52.473 region:rollup2
AND DISCUSS COMPROMISE SOME

01:46:51.739 --> 01:46:55.309 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY.

01:46:52.473 --> 01:46:56.477 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY OPEN TO THAT AND IT.

01:46:55.309 --> 01:46:58.178 region:rollup2
FURTHER TO THE POINT.

01:46:56.477 --> 01:46:59.546 region:rollup2
AYE AYE CERTAINLY WOULD NEVER

01:46:58.178 --> 01:47:01.181 region:rollup2
TRY TO SPEAK UP FOR

01:46:59.546 --> 01:47:01.982 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHAO.

01:47:01.181 --> 01:47:04.718 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:47:01.982 --> 01:47:06.320 region:rollup2
AYE I HEAR HIS COMMENTS AND I

01:47:04.718 --> 01:47:08.355 region:rollup2
SEE THEM MORE AS AN ADMONITION

01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:11.759 region:rollup2
THAN A SUGGESTION A REQUEST.

01:47:08.355 --> 01:47:12.293 region:rollup2
THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT A

01:47:11.759 --> 01:47:13.627 region:rollup2
AT ALTERNATIVES I WOULD.

01:47:12.293 --> 01:47:15.162 region:rollup2
.

01:47:13.627 --> 01:47:16.530 region:rollup2
POINT OUT ONE OTHER THE OTHER

01:47:15.162 --> 01:47:18.065 region:rollup2
THING AND THAT IS SO.

01:47:16.530 --> 01:47:20.334 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE.

01:47:18.065 --> 01:47:21.535 region:rollup2
FACED WITH CERTAIN FACTS WITH

01:47:20.334 --> 01:47:22.403 region:rollup2
RESPECT TO THE.

01:47:21.535 --> 01:47:25.072 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY.

01:47:22.403 --> 01:47:25.506 region:rollup2
OF LEGISLATIVE SCHEDULE THAT

01:47:25.072 --> 01:47:28.742 region:rollup2
PUTS.

01:47:25.506 --> 01:47:30.844 region:rollup2
ANY DISCUSSION OF A COMPROMISE

01:47:28.742 --> 01:47:32.179 region:rollup2
WHETHER THIS AND AND AND OTHER

01:47:30.844 --> 01:47:33.814 region:rollup2

01:47:33.814 --> 01:47:37.318 region:rollup2

RECORD HERE.

01:47:39.787 --> 01:47:42.957 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME HERE

01:47:41.655 --> 01:47:44.625 region:rollup2
TODAY I THINK THERE'S GOOD

01:47:42.957 --> 01:47:46.460 region:rollup2

01:47:44.625 --> 01:47:48.562 region:rollup2

BILL COULD COME TO THE FLOOR

01:47:55.502 --> 01:47:58.939 region:rollup2
AND HAVE A BROADER DEBATE THERE

01:47:57.037 --> 01:48:00.307 region:rollup2
WOULD BE DISCUSSION BETWEEN NOW

GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS

01:48:02.876 --> 01:48:06.714 region:rollup2

03:58:59.892 --> 03:59:02.595 region:rollup2
DISAPPOINTED SINCE I HEAR SO

03:59:01.227 --> 03:59:03.930 region:rollup2
MUCH

03:59:02.595 --> 03:59:05.398 region:rollup2
FROM THE OPPOSITION AND OTHERS

AND MAY BE SIX INCUMBENT

03:59:11.704 --> 03:59:15.908 region:rollup2

CONVERSATIONS AROUND IT IN AND

03:59:24.917 --> 03:59:28.554 region:rollup2
WHY WE HAVE TO WAIT.

THIS LONG TO HAVE THAT NOTION

03:59:28.554 --> 03:59:32.792 region:rollup2
BROUGHT FORWARD IS IS A LITTLE

03:59:30.289 --> 03:59:34.827 region:rollup2
BIT FRUSTRATING AND SO FOR I

KNOW THAT THERE IS SOME CONCERN.

03:59:34.827 --> 03:59:39.098 region:rollup2

03:59:39.098 --> 03:59:42.568 region:rollup2
OTHER WAY OF APPROACHING IT AND

03:59:40.900 --> 03:59:44.136 region:rollup2
MAY BE MODIFIED COSTA HAWKINS

03:59:42.568 --> 03:59:45.471 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE THE ONLY WAY FOR THAT TO

03:59:44.136 --> 03:59:47.506 region:rollup2
HAPPEN IS FOR US TO PASS THIS

ONLY WAY WE MOVE IT FORWARD

FOR PRESENTING THIS TODAY. I'M

04:00:37.590 --> 04:00:40.026 region:rollup2
YOU SAY YOU'RE ADVOCATING FOR

04:00:38.691 --> 04:00:41.560 region:rollup2
LOCAL CONTROL ON THAT THIS BILL

04:00:40.026 --> 04:00:42.328 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY DOES ACT LOOK WHAT

04:00:41.560 --> 04:00:44.430 region:rollup2
IS THE POSITION OF THE

04:00:42.328 --> 04:00:47.266 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LEAGUE CITIES AND

04:00:44.430 --> 04:00:49.468 region:rollup2
ALSO SEES ACT.

04:00:47.266 --> 04:00:51.003 region:rollup2
I'M NOT CERTAIN.

04:00:49.468 --> 04:00:55.808 region:rollup2
OKAY BECAUSE I I MEAN THEY'RE

04:00:51.003 --> 04:00:57.443 region:rollup2
THE CHAMPIONS OF LOCAL CONTROL.

04:00:55.808 --> 04:00:58.344 region:rollup2
THE NO POSITION AS FAR NO

04:00:57.443 --> 04:00:59.812 region:rollup2
MUSICIAN VERY GOOD.

04:00:58.344 --> 04:01:01.447 region:rollup2
FIRST I'D LIKE TO THINK THE

04:00:59.812 --> 04:01:03.149 region:rollup2
SERGEANTS FOR DOING AN ADMIRABLE

04:01:01.447 --> 04:01:04.517 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL JOB IN AND MANAGING

04:01:03.149 --> 04:01:05.685 region:rollup2
PUBLIC TESTIMONY TODAY I THINK

04:01:04.517 --> 04:01:06.919 region:rollup2
WE ALL WILL AGREE THAT THERE IS

04:01:05.685 --> 04:01:08.821 region:rollup2
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF.

04:01:06.919 --> 04:01:09.622 region:rollup2
OPINIONS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE

04:01:08.821 --> 04:01:11.057 region:rollup2
ISSUE AND I THINK THIS ARTIST OF

04:01:09.622 --> 04:01:13.326 region:rollup2
DONE AT A GREAT JOB IN KEEPING

04:01:11.057 --> 04:01:14.393 region:rollup2
THAT. MOVING FORWARD AND I LIKE

04:01:13.326 --> 04:01:15.494 region:rollup2
TO THINK THE AUTHOR ALSO FOR

04:01:14.393 --> 04:01:17.196 region:rollup2
BRING THIS FORWARD IT'S IT'S A

04:01:15.494 --> 04:01:17.830 region:rollup2
LOT OF WORK IT'S HEAVY LIFTING I

04:01:17.196 --> 04:01:20.066 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND.

04:01:17.830 --> 04:01:21.567 region:rollup2
THEY CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THIS AND

04:01:20.066 --> 04:01:22.902 region:rollup2
AND TO BOTH THE PROPONENTS AND

04:01:21.567 --> 04:01:24.103 region:rollup2
OPPONENTS FOR MAKING VERY GOOD

04:01:22.902 --> 04:01:24.637 region:rollup2
ARGUMENTS.

04:01:24.103 --> 04:01:25.538 region:rollup2
FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD TODAY

04:01:24.637 --> 04:01:26.339 region:rollup2
THOUGH I BELIEVE TO RECONCILE

04:01:25.538 --> 04:01:27.807 region:rollup2
COULD BE THE TIPPING POINT

04:01:26.339 --> 04:01:28.874 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

04:01:27.807 --> 04:01:30.409 region:rollup2
IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT THE

04:01:28.874 --> 04:01:31.444 region:rollup2
SOLUTION TO THE HOUSING CRISIS

04:01:30.409 --> 04:01:33.179 region:rollup2
IS INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF

04:01:31.444 --> 04:01:35.081 region:rollup2
HOMES.

04:01:33.179 --> 04:01:36.782 region:rollup2
REPEALING COSTA HAWKINS DOES NOT

04:01:35.081 --> 04:01:38.150 region:rollup2
SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS.

04:01:36.782 --> 04:01:42.722 region:rollup2
IT POTENTIALLY COULD EXACERBATE

04:01:38.150 --> 04:01:45.358 region:rollup2
IT.

04:01:42.722 --> 04:01:46.892 region:rollup2
AGAIN I ASK EVERYONE TO PLEASE

04:01:45.358 --> 04:01:48.594 region:rollup2
IF YOU NEED TO TALK.

04:01:46.892 --> 04:01:50.863 region:rollup2
TAKE IT OUTSIDE

04:01:48.594 --> 04:01:52.164 region:rollup2
MR STEINORTH THANK YOU.

04:01:50.863 --> 04:01:53.933 region:rollup2
AND IT HURTS SMALL PROPERTY

04:01:52.164 --> 04:01:55.234 region:rollup2
OWNERS THE MOST

04:01:53.933 --> 04:01:57.336 region:rollup2
BY EXTENDING RENT CONTROL THE

04:01:55.234 --> 04:01:58.771 region:rollup2
SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND CONDOS

04:01:57.336 --> 04:02:00.106 region:rollup2
AND ALLOWING RENT CONTROL ANY

04:01:58.771 --> 04:02:02.274 region:rollup2
UNIT FOR LIFE WITH ONLY MINOR

04:02:00.106 --> 04:02:03.642 region:rollup2
INCREASES. THIS WILL HURT SMALL

04:02:02.274 --> 04:02:05.144 region:rollup2
OWNERS IS THE MAJORITY OF THE

04:02:03.642 --> 04:02:07.146 region:rollup2
SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND CONDOS

04:02:05.144 --> 04:02:08.647 region:rollup2
ARE OWNED BY INDIVIDUALS NOT BIG

04:02:07.146 --> 04:02:09.949 region:rollup2
CORPORATIONS.

04:02:08.647 --> 04:02:12.651 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A COUPLE HUNDRED

04:02:09.949 --> 04:02:13.419 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SINGLE FAMILY RENTALS.

04:02:12.651 --> 04:02:15.054 region:rollup2
NOW I APPRECIATE AGAIN THE

04:02:13.419 --> 04:02:16.555 region:rollup2
AUTHORS OF PROPONENTS INTENTIONS

04:02:15.054 --> 04:02:17.890 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE AFFORDABLE

04:02:16.555 --> 04:02:19.458 region:rollup2
AND SAFE OUT OF HOUSING IN

04:02:17.890 --> 04:02:21.494 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BUT I'M. I'M

04:02:19.458 --> 04:02:23.596 region:rollup2
CONFIDENT THAT AB FIFTEEN NO SIX

04:02:21.494 --> 04:02:25.064 region:rollup2
WILL DO THE. OPPOSITE OF THE

04:02:23.596 --> 04:02:28.067 region:rollup2
DESIRED GOALS I'LL BE VOTING NO

04:02:25.064 --> 04:02:30.269 region:rollup2
TODAY.

04:02:28.067 --> 04:02:32.038 region:rollup2
THANK YOU OTHER COMMENTS MISTER

04:02:30.269 --> 04:02:33.139 region:rollup2
DOCTOR WHAT.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK

04:02:33.139 --> 04:02:35.374 region:rollup2
YOU TO EVERYONE WHO'S BEEN HERE

04:02:33.806 --> 04:02:36.809 region:rollup2
IT THE AUTHOR FOR THIS WORK ON

04:02:35.374 --> 04:02:39.078 region:rollup2
THIS I BELIEVE WHICH IS A VERY

04:02:36.809 --> 04:02:40.746 region:rollup2
VERY COMPLICATED TOPIC.

04:02:39.078 --> 04:02:41.914 region:rollup2
WE'RE FACING A CRISIS IN

04:02:40.746 --> 04:02:43.449 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THERE'S ABSOLUTE NOTE

04:02:41.914 --> 04:02:44.784 region:rollup2
ABOUT NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

04:02:43.449 --> 04:02:45.918 region:rollup2
MAJORITY RATHER SPEND MORE THAN

04:02:44.784 --> 04:02:47.286 region:rollup2
THIRTY PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME

04:02:45.918 --> 04:02:49.088 region:rollup2
ON RENT COSTS AND THAT'S CLEARLY

04:02:47.286 --> 04:02:49.989 region:rollup2
NOT SUSTAINABLE.

04:02:49.088 --> 04:02:51.557 region:rollup2
BUT I TO BELIEVE THE ROUTE

04:02:49.989 --> 04:02:52.658 region:rollup2
CRISIS BECAUSE OF THIS CRISIS

04:02:51.557 --> 04:02:54.794 region:rollup2
OUR FAILURE TO BUILD ENOUGH

04:02:52.658 --> 04:02:56.862 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND KEEP UP

04:02:54.794 --> 04:02:58.064 region:rollup2
WITH OUR GROWING POPULATION.

04:02:56.862 --> 04:02:59.632 region:rollup2
WE TOOK STEPS LAST YEAR IN THE

04:02:58.064 --> 04:03:01.233 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TO TRY TO ADDRESS

04:02:59.632 --> 04:03:02.134 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE HURDLES THAT CREATED

04:03:01.233 --> 04:03:04.170 region:rollup2
THIS DYNAMIC BUT WE'RE STILL

04:03:02.134 --> 04:03:05.838 region:rollup2
VERY FAR BEHIND.

04:03:04.170 --> 04:03:07.006 region:rollup2
I ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT'S AT

04:03:05.838 --> 04:03:08.240 region:rollup2
COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT

04:03:07.006 --> 04:03:09.408 region:rollup2
THAT'S ESSENTIAL THAT WE

04:03:08.240 --> 04:03:10.976 region:rollup2
CONSIDER SETTING ASIDE

04:03:09.408 --> 04:03:12.511 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT SOLELY FOR

04:03:10.976 --> 04:03:14.213 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE HOUSING GET BACK TO

04:03:12.511 --> 04:03:15.614 region:rollup2
WHERE WE WERE. IN MY COMMUNITY

04:03:14.213 --> 04:03:16.949 region:rollup2
THE LAST AFFORDABLE HOUSING

04:03:15.614 --> 04:03:19.118 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT WAS BUILT WHEN WE

04:03:16.949 --> 04:03:20.453 region:rollup2
HAD DEVELOPED HAD REDEVELOPMENT

04:03:19.118 --> 04:03:21.821 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE THAT CRITICAL

04:03:20.453 --> 04:03:23.622 region:rollup2
RESOURCE NOW AND I THINK IT'S

04:03:21.821 --> 04:03:25.291 region:rollup2
REALLY HURT US. AND HURT PEOPLE

04:03:23.622 --> 04:03:27.693 region:rollup2
WHO LIVE IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

04:03:25.291 --> 04:03:28.627 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO THE WILDFIRES INCIDENTS

04:03:27.693 --> 04:03:30.095 region:rollup2
NUMBER COUNTY.

04:03:28.627 --> 04:03:31.497 region:rollup2
AND MENDOCINO COUNTY.

04:03:30.095 --> 04:03:33.566 region:rollup2
R. VACANCY RATE IN BOTH

04:03:31.497 --> 04:03:34.900 region:rollup2
COUNTIES WAS ABOUT OR LESS THAN

04:03:33.566 --> 04:03:36.102 region:rollup2
TEN TWO PERCENT.

04:03:34.900 --> 04:03:37.803 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS ONLY WORSENED IN THE

04:03:36.102 --> 04:03:39.405 region:rollup2
LAST FEW MONTHS.

04:03:37.803 --> 04:03:41.574 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING AT OVER.

04:03:39.405 --> 04:03:42.908 region:rollup2
FIVE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED

04:03:41.574 --> 04:03:44.577 region:rollup2
HOMES THAT NEED TO BE REBUILT IN

04:03:42.908 --> 04:03:45.711 region:rollup2
MY TO COUNTIES.

04:03:44.577 --> 04:03:47.513 region:rollup2
AND MANY OF THESE SERVE OUR

04:03:45.711 --> 04:03:49.715 region:rollup2
MULTI FAMILY HOMES.

04:03:47.513 --> 04:03:50.249 region:rollup2
AND I I SUPPORT BECAUSE I THE

04:03:49.715 --> 04:03:52.184 region:rollup2
MEASURES TO CONTAIN RISING

04:03:50.249 --> 04:03:54.120 region:rollup2
COSTS.

04:03:52.184 --> 04:03:55.621 region:rollup2
BUT I'M NOT CONFIDENT CAUGHT A

04:03:54.120 --> 04:03:57.490 region:rollup2
COTTON QUITE CONFIDENT.

04:03:55.621 --> 04:04:00.059 region:rollup2
THAT A COMPLETE REPEAL OF COSTA

04:03:57.490 --> 04:04:01.193 region:rollup2
HAWKINS IS THE ANSWER.

04:04:00.059 --> 04:04:02.862 region:rollup2
IN MY DEBT DISTRICT WERE

04:04:01.193 --> 04:04:04.230 region:rollup2
DEDICATED TO REBUILDING.

04:04:02.862 --> 04:04:05.431 region:rollup2
I'M CONCERNED THAT THE BILL DOES

04:04:04.230 --> 04:04:06.365 region:rollup2
NOTHING TO FACILITATE AN

04:04:05.431 --> 04:04:07.833 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN THE SUPPLY OF

04:04:06.365 --> 04:04:08.601 region:rollup2
HOUSING IN ME MAY TH AND MAY IN

04:04:07.833 --> 04:04:10.035 region:rollup2
FACT.

04:04:08.601 --> 04:04:11.203 region:rollup2
HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT BY

04:04:10.035 --> 04:04:12.338 region:rollup2
DISCOURAGING NEW CONSTRUCTION

04:04:11.203 --> 04:04:14.340 region:rollup2
DURING A TIME WHEN WE NEED IT

04:04:12.338 --> 04:04:15.808 region:rollup2
THE MOST.

04:04:14.340 --> 04:04:17.409 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO THE AUTHOR I

04:04:15.808 --> 04:04:18.344 region:rollup2
THINK THE MESSAGE FROM ADVOCATES

REQUIRE THAT THEY DO THAT.

04:05:44.830 --> 04:05:47.1000 region:rollup2

.

04:06:00.613 --> 04:06:03.716 region:rollup2
REPEAL OF EVERY ONE OF THE THREE

04:06:02.181 --> 04:06:05.784 region:rollup2
COMPONENTS THAT IS CURRENTLY

04:06:03.716 --> 04:06:07.119 region:rollup2
COSTA HAWKINS TOUCHES KNOW ME

04:06:05.784 --> 04:06:08.520 region:rollup2
THEY COULD THEY COULD TAKE SOME

04:06:07.119 --> 04:06:09.855 region:rollup2
OF THE COULD LEAVE SOME RIGHT.

04:06:08.520 --> 04:06:12.958 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE WHOLE IDEA AND THEY

04:06:09.855 --> 04:06:13.325 region:rollup2
COULD ARM PROVIDE. A SET OF

04:06:12.958 --> 04:06:14.927 region:rollup2
NUANCE

04:06:13.325 --> 04:06:16.195 region:rollup2
TO.

04:06:14.927 --> 04:06:17.930 region:rollup2
THE SOME OF THE COMPONENTS FOR

04:06:16.195 --> 04:06:20.299 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE PROVIDING EIGHT EIGHT

04:06:17.930 --> 04:06:22.234 region:rollup2
EIGHT ROLLING DEFINITION OF WHAT

04:06:20.299 --> 04:06:25.204 region:rollup2
NEW CONSTRUCTION HAS.

04:06:22.234 --> 04:06:27.840 region:rollup2
SO THAT IT'S NOT STUCK IN IN IN

04:06:25.204 --> 04:06:29.642 region:rollup2
IN CEMENT AT A MOMENT IN TIME

04:06:27.840 --> 04:06:32.077 region:rollup2
AND A HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW.

04:06:29.642 --> 04:06:33.312 region:rollup2
.

04:06:32.077 --> 04:06:34.413 region:rollup2
SOMETHING BUILT AFTER NINETEEN

04:06:33.312 --> 04:06:35.914 region:rollup2
NINETY FIVE IS STILL CONSIDERED

04:06:34.413 --> 04:06:37.283 region:rollup2
NEW CONSTRUCTION ONE IT'S NOT.

04:06:35.914 --> 04:06:38.817 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT A

04:06:37.283 --> 04:06:40.853 region:rollup2
A REASONABLE.

04:06:38.817 --> 04:06:42.121 region:rollup2
PERIOD OF TIME FOR RETURN ON

04:06:40.853 --> 04:06:43.222 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT I MEAN ALL ALL THAT

04:06:42.121 --> 04:06:44.790 region:rollup2
CAN BE PART OF THE DISCUSSIONS

04:06:43.222 --> 04:06:46.058 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD GO ON THE LOCAL LEVEL

04:06:44.790 --> 04:06:48.427 region:rollup2
RIGHT THAT'S CORRECT.

04:06:46.058 --> 04:06:49.962 region:rollup2
AND MOM AND POPS

04:06:48.427 --> 04:06:50.462 region:rollup2
IF A LOCAL DISTRICT JURISDICTION

04:06:49.962 --> 04:06:51.730 region:rollup2
CHOSE TO DO THEY CAN BE

04:06:50.462 --> 04:06:53.699 region:rollup2
EXEMPTED.

04:06:51.730 --> 04:06:55.601 region:rollup2
AND AND FOCUS COULD BE PUT ON

04:06:53.699 --> 04:06:56.902 region:rollup2
WALL STREET ARE CORPORATIONS

04:06:55.601 --> 04:06:59.171 region:rollup2
WITH INVESTOR OWNED SINGLE

04:06:56.902 --> 04:07:00.506 region:rollup2
FAMILY HOMES AND CONDOS CORRECT

04:06:59.171 --> 04:07:02.107 region:rollup2
TRIP. TO OFFICE OKAY SO I MEAN

04:07:00.506 --> 04:07:03.642 region:rollup2
IT.

04:07:02.107 --> 04:07:04.476 region:rollup2
THE POINT HERE IS THAT THERE'S

04:07:03.642 --> 04:07:05.244 region:rollup2
THERE'S THERE'S A WORLD OF

04:07:04.476 --> 04:07:07.446 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITIES.

04:07:05.244 --> 04:07:08.781 region:rollup2
.

04:07:07.446 --> 04:07:11.016 region:rollup2
FROM DOING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

04:07:08.781 --> 04:07:12.951 region:rollup2
TO.

04:07:11.016 --> 04:07:16.622 region:rollup2
I'M TAKING A AN OPPORTUNITY TO

AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CAN.

04:07:20.426 --> 04:07:23.762 region:rollup2
CAN.

04:07:21.527 --> 04:07:26.265 region:rollup2
CRAFT.

04:07:23.762 --> 04:07:27.566 region:rollup2
A TAILORED SOLUTION TO THE

04:07:26.265 --> 04:07:29.868 region:rollup2
PROBLEM FITS IN THEIR IN THEIR

CAPITOL.

.

04:12:12.217 --> 04:12:14.052 region:rollup2
AS HAS BEEN SAID THIS IS WHAT

04:12:13.018 --> 04:12:15.120 region:rollup2
DEMOCRACY LOOKS LIKE IT IS NOT

04:12:14.052 --> 04:12:16.622 region:rollup2

HUNDREDS OF SAN FRANCISCANS.

04:12:24.062 --> 04:12:27.332 region:rollup2
THAT CAME OUT ANNA ON THIS ISSUE

04:12:26.264 --> 04:12:29.234 region:rollup2
ARE AND.

EVERYONE BRINGS TO THIS TABLE.

04:12:33.238 --> 04:12:37.075 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT

04:12:35.440 --> 04:12:38.510 region:rollup2
EVERY MEMBER OF THE SAN

04:12:37.075 --> 04:12:40.312 region:rollup2
FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS

04:12:38.510 --> 04:12:41.847 region:rollup2
LAST MONTH UNANIMOUSLY PASSED A

04:12:40.312 --> 04:12:43.148 region:rollup2
RESOLUTION TO SUPPORT AB FIFTEEN

04:12:41.847 --> 04:12:45.083 region:rollup2
SIX OR SIX.

04:12:43.148 --> 04:12:46.284 region:rollup2
UNANIMOUS SUPPORT I THINK THAT

04:12:45.083 --> 04:12:48.754 region:rollup2
IS BASED ON WHAT WE CAN ALL

04:12:46.284 --> 04:12:50.155 region:rollup2
AGREE ON. ARE THAT WE ARE IN THE

04:12:48.754 --> 04:12:52.391 region:rollup2
MIDST OF THE MOST INTENSE

04:12:50.155 --> 04:12:53.091 region:rollup2
HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR CITIES AND

04:12:52.391 --> 04:12:54.760 region:rollup2
OUR STATE THAT WE'VE EVER

04:12:53.091 --> 04:12:56.061 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED.

04:12:54.760 --> 04:12:56.595 region:rollup2
I AND MY DISTRICT HAS BEEN ONE

04:12:56.061 --> 04:12:59.331 region:rollup2
THE EPICENTERS OF OF THAT

04:12:56.595 --> 04:13:00.165 region:rollup2
CRISIS.

04:12:59.331 --> 04:13:02.567 region:rollup2
LET ME ALSO SAY.

04:13:00.165 --> 04:13:03.468 region:rollup2
THAT I DON'T THINK ANYONE

04:13:02.567 --> 04:13:04.903 region:rollup2
BELIEVES THAT RENT CONTROL IS

04:13:03.468 --> 04:13:07.072 region:rollup2
PERFECT

04:13:04.903 --> 04:13:08.607 region:rollup2
BUT I ALSO THINK THAT IS ONE OF

04:13:07.072 --> 04:13:09.875 region:rollup2
THE FEW THINGS THAT WE HAVE FROM

04:13:08.607 --> 04:13:11.543 region:rollup2
A POLICY PERSPECTIVE THAT IS

04:13:09.875 --> 04:13:12.611 region:rollup2
PROTECTING.

04:13:11.543 --> 04:13:14.379 region:rollup2
SOME ECONOMIC DIVERSITY IN OUR

04:13:12.611 --> 04:13:17.449 region:rollup2
CITIES.

04:13:14.379 --> 04:13:18.950 region:rollup2
ARM WHEN CAREFULLY CRAFTED. WEEP

04:13:17.449 --> 04:13:21.186 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THE RENT CONTROL CAN'T

04:13:18.950 --> 04:13:23.055 region:rollup2
OFFER MUCH NEEDED RELIEF TO

04:13:21.186 --> 04:13:24.656 region:rollup2
TENANTS WHILE STILL ENSURING THE

04:13:23.055 --> 04:13:26.558 region:rollup2
PROPERTY OWNERS RECEIVE A FAIR

04:13:24.656 --> 04:13:27.626 region:rollup2
RATE OF RETURN.

04:13:26.558 --> 04:13:28.660 region:rollup2
WE ALSO KNOW THAT EVERY CITY

04:13:27.626 --> 04:13:29.995 region:rollup2
EVERY COUNTY EVERY LOCAL

04:13:28.660 --> 04:13:31.730 region:rollup2
JURISDICTION IN CALIFORNIA IS

04:13:29.995 --> 04:13:33.365 region:rollup2
UNIQUE.

04:13:31.730 --> 04:13:35.067 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS WHY I THINK THAT

04:13:33.365 --> 04:13:37.102 region:rollup2
EVERY CITY COUNTY SHOULD HAVE

04:13:35.067 --> 04:13:39.237 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY IN DECIDING WHAT

04:13:37.102 --> 04:13:40.806 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES WORK FOR THEM. ARE WE

04:13:39.237 --> 04:13:42.374 region:rollup2
KNOW HISTORICALLY IN THE PAST

04:13:40.806 --> 04:13:43.375 region:rollup2
THAT NOT EVERY CITY WILL DECIDE

04:13:42.374 --> 04:13:45.510 region:rollup2
TO ENACT RENT CONTROL.

04:13:43.375 --> 04:13:47.312 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S APPROPRIATE.

04:13:45.510 --> 04:13:48.780 region:rollup2
NOR WILL THERE BE CITIES THAT

04:13:47.312 --> 04:13:50.515 region:rollup2
HAVE EXISTING POLICIES THAT MAY

04:13:48.780 --> 04:13:51.750 region:rollup2
I UP TO WERE NOT UP TO MEND THEM

04:13:50.515 --> 04:13:53.485 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT.

04:13:51.750 --> 04:13:55.520 region:rollup2
TO ALLOW CITIES TO HAVE THOSE

04:13:53.485 --> 04:13:56.488 region:rollup2
CHOICES.

04:13:55.520 --> 04:13:57.322 region:rollup2
AM I WANT TO SAY TO THE

04:13:56.488 --> 04:13:58.757 region:rollup2
OPPONENTS I APPRECIATE THE

04:13:57.322 --> 04:14:00.225 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVES

04:13:58.757 --> 04:14:01.793 region:rollup2
I HAVE CERTAINLY BEE BEEN

04:14:00.225 --> 04:14:03.495 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT THEM AND ALL OF

04:14:01.793 --> 04:14:05.664 region:rollup2
US I THINK ARE OPEN TO OTHER

04:14:03.495 --> 04:14:07.132 region:rollup2
IDEAS AND HOW WE ADDRESS THIS.

04:14:05.664 --> 04:14:08.567 region:rollup2
BUT AS I WAS TRYING TO MAKE THE

04:14:07.132 --> 04:14:10.769 region:rollup2
POINT EARLIER TODAY I THINK

04:14:08.567 --> 04:14:12.404 region:rollup2
WITHOUT OTHER IDEAS.

04:14:10.769 --> 04:14:14.439 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH

04:14:12.404 --> 04:14:16.041 region:rollup2
THIS BILL NON.

04:14:14.439 --> 04:14:18.210 region:rollup2

04:14:16.041 --> 04:14:20.846 region:rollup2
LIFE ADULT LIFE HAS ATTENDANCE

04:14:18.210 --> 04:14:22.514 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW. I'VE SPOKEN TO

04:14:20.846 --> 04:14:25.250 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF TENANTS

04:14:22.514 --> 04:14:26.918 region:rollup2
WHO ARE SUFFERING IMMENSELY.

04:14:25.250 --> 04:14:27.552 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEY'VE BEEN EVICTED OR

04:14:26.918 --> 04:14:28.487 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEY ARE ON THE VERGE OF

04:14:27.552 --> 04:14:30.722 region:rollup2
BEING EVICTED.

04:14:28.487 --> 04:14:31.756 region:rollup2
IMMIGRANT TENANTS.

04:14:30.722 --> 04:14:33.892 region:rollup2
FAMILIES WHO ARE TENANTS

04:14:31.756 --> 04:14:34.392 region:rollup2

LGBT YOUTH.

04:14:38.396 --> 04:14:40.499 region:rollup2

SUFFERING

04:14:44.770 --> 04:14:48.807 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
