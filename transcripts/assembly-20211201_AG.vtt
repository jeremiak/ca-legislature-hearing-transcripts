AND FIFTY DEALS THAT HAD NEEDED

00:33:46.124 --> 00:33:49.293
SHEET AND AMONGST THOSE FIELDS

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.396
THE AVERAGE CRAP ONE HUNDRED

00:33:51.462 --> 00:33:52.563
THIRTY THREE PERCENT. WHICH I

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:54.132
THINK MOST OF YOU KNOW AND IT'S

00:33:54.198 --> 00:33:55.900
JUST NOT A SUSTAINABLE NUMBER

00:33:55.967 --> 00:33:59.771
GAVE. THE DEAL THAT. AND IN MOST

00:33:59.837 --> 00:34:02.206
CASES THOSE FIELD HAD BOTH IRAN

00:34:02.273 --> 00:34:10.415
AND. THE AND THE ON. SO TO BACK

00:34:10.481 --> 00:34:11.916
THAT UP EVEN MORE OR TO. OUR

00:34:11.983 --> 00:34:15.620
EVEN MORE WE CAN DO IN A- STUDY

. WITH TWELVE LARGE IF COULD DO

00:34:18.689 --> 00:34:20.358
NOT A WHOLE VALLEY BUT A

00:34:20.425 --> 00:34:22.627
REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE. AND A MOM

00:34:22.693 --> 00:34:30.935
. THE WHO PURCHASE. IN THE STUDY. WE ARE COMMITTED ARE- LAW AND

00:34:31.002 --> 00:34:34.205
WE USUALLY FORTY AND MILLION

00:34:34.272 --> 00:34:34.806
SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS

00:34:34.872 --> 00:34:37.508
LAST YEAR. THE OTHER THING THAT

00:34:37.575 --> 00:34:40.244
WOULD BE MOST. ABOUT THAT

00:34:40.311 --> 00:34:42.413
STARTED WITH THE FACT GROW RISK

A LOT MORE MONEY. CURRENTLY AND

00:34:46.484 --> 00:34:49.854
HAS MADE. TO THE THREE. AND SO

00:34:49.921 --> 00:34:52.790
WE THOUGHT INCREASE OF SIX

00:34:52.857 --> 00:34:54.091
HUNDRED NINETY DOLLARS PER ACRE

THAT COULD BE. A CONSERVATIVE

00:35:16.047 --> 00:35:24.155

BETTER HEARING KNOW OF THE THAT

00:43:24.401 --> 00:43:28.672
. TO THE ONE THIS IS ACTIVE-

00:43:28.739 --> 00:43:34.945
MANAGE. THAT IS A WE A HUGE

00:43:35.012 --> 00:43:39.049
CENTER. ONE LANDING THE GOAL

00:43:39.116 --> 00:43:40.884
THREE IT'S HARD ON ONE

00:43:40.951 --> 00:43:44.088

THIS MATERIAL SO WE THINK WE'RE

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:07.811
OUT OF OUR OWN TIME WITHOUT

BEEN AT THIS FOR THIRTY SIX

00:49:44.014 --> 00:49:46.750
YEARS AND- I'VE NEVER SEEN A

00:49:46.817 --> 00:49:50.887
DISEASE- ANAHIT AND CANNOT WAIT-

00:49:50.954 --> 00:49:56.526
DOWNFIELD IN THE WAY. THAT THAT

00:49:56.593 --> 00:49:58.528

THE WHY IT'S GOING UP AND I

00:50:14.978 --> 00:50:16.480

RELYING ON A COOL SEASON IT IS

00:50:19.116 --> 00:50:22.819
VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE- YOU KNOW

00:50:22.886 --> 00:50:24.488
IT WAS ACTUALLY KIND OF UNUSUAL

00:50:24.554 --> 00:50:26.990
THE COOL LAST YEAR AND- WHY THAT

00:50:27.057 --> 00:50:29.059
WAS- I DON'T THINK WE CAN COUNT

00:50:29.126 --> 00:50:33.530
ON IT FOR- YOU KNOW. THAT

00:50:33.597 --> 00:50:36.967
FORCIBLE FUTURE. AND- SO THIS IS

00:50:37.033 --> 00:50:38.668
JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME- CLOSE UPS

00:50:38.735 --> 00:50:40.504

IF HE GIVES YOU THAT- KIND OF

00:50:42.506 --> 00:50:44.708
BIRTH SITTING THE PRODUCT-

00:50:44.775 --> 00:50:49.079
TISSUE ON THE OLDER LEAD AND-

00:50:49.146 --> 00:50:51.281
BUT IT ALSO HAS A VERY AND WE

00:50:51.348 --> 00:50:53.350
SEEN WHERE SOMETIMES THE PLANTS

00:50:53.417 --> 00:50:55.819
LOOK NORMAL NINETY. INTO THEM

00:50:55.886 --> 00:50:59.689
AND THEN THE INTERNAL AREA IS-

00:50:59.756 --> 00:51:02.559
HIGHLY AFFECTED AND SO YOU KNOW

00:51:02.626 --> 00:51:05.729
ALL OF THIS IS COURSES

00:51:05.796 --> 00:51:08.031
UNMARKETABLE. AND FIFTY WILL

00:51:08.098 --> 00:51:10.300
EXPRESS ITSELF DIFFERENTLY IN

00:51:10.367 --> 00:51:13.503
THAT- IT DOES WILL DOWN THE PLAN

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:16.640
AS AS THE NAME IMPLIES. AND A

00:51:16.706 --> 00:51:18.241
LOT OF TIMES IT'LL SHOW UP ON

00:51:18.308 --> 00:51:19.843
THE BOTTOM INTO THE FIELD FOR

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:21.411
BUT IT CAN ALSO IN SEVERE

00:51:21.478 --> 00:51:25.315
SITUATIONS OF COURSE- TAKE- AT

00:51:25.382 --> 00:51:27.651
KEEP GOING IN AND CAN BE SEVERE

00:51:27.717 --> 00:51:29.853
IN IN ALL PARTS OF THE FIELD.

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.488
YOU KNOW THE OTHER LEAVES- WILL

00:51:31.555 --> 00:51:33.056
DOWN AND THEN THE INTERLEAVED

00:51:33.123 --> 00:51:36.393
WITH HIM TO BE- GREEN. STILL

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:38.228
UNTIL THE PLAN FINALLY DIED AND

00:51:38.295 --> 00:51:40.697
THEN. WITH YOU- WHEN YOU START

00:51:40.764 --> 00:51:42.899
DIGGING AND LOOKING AT THE- THE

00:51:42.966 --> 00:51:44.901
ROOT SYSTEM YOU SEE THE ACTUAL

00:51:44.968 --> 00:51:50.173
RIDING. IN AND PRIOR TO THIS-

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.441
OUT YET IF THE- YOU KNOW THE-

00:51:51.508 --> 00:51:53.610
SURGEON OF HIM WE'VE REALLY HAD

00:51:53.677 --> 00:51:56.746
A ROOF RIDING. ORGANISM ON THE

00:51:56.813 --> 00:51:58.748
PLANET SO THIS IS THIS IS THE

00:51:58.815 --> 00:52:01.585
NEW- CHEN NOMINA THAT WE'RE

00:52:01.651 --> 00:52:02.652
DEALING WITH HE HAD THINK

00:52:02.719 --> 00:52:05.655
THEY'LL ROUTE THE CROWN BUT NOT

00:52:05.722 --> 00:52:09.292
THE ROOT. AND SO YOU KNOW IN

00:52:09.359 --> 00:52:10.527
TERMS OF LIKE THE CONTROL

00:52:10.594 --> 00:52:13.597
OPTIONS AGAIN THIS OF THE- TALK

00:52:13.663 --> 00:52:15.499
ABOUT IN MORE DETAIL BUT- THE

00:52:15.565 --> 00:52:18.735
THREAT- WHICH SPREAD SIGN IN THE

00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:20.570
MIDDLE THIS ADDS A LEVEL OF

00:52:20.637 --> 00:52:23.073
COMPLEXITY. WHERE YOU'RE DEALING

00:52:23.139 --> 00:52:26.743
WITH- YOU KNOW INTO POPULATION

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:28.812
AND THEIR RESPONSE TO WHETHER.

00:52:28.879 --> 00:52:30.947
OTHERS WANT THE TEMPERATURES.

00:52:31.014 --> 00:52:34.718
AND. AND THEN OF COURSE THE

00:52:34.784 --> 00:52:35.986
CONTROL MEASURES. AND THING IS

00:52:36.052 --> 00:52:38.355
ALSO. BY BY THEM AS YOU WELL

00:52:38.421 --> 00:52:39.923
KNOW IN THE LATEST VALLEY IN THE

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:43.360
AFTERNOON WE HAVE- YOU KNOW

00:52:43.426 --> 00:52:45.362
NORTHERLY WINDS THAT COME DOWN

00:52:45.428 --> 00:52:47.330
THE VALLEY AND EVEN SEX ARE

00:52:47.397 --> 00:52:53.970
EASILY. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT

00:52:54.037 --> 00:52:55.705
WE HAVE THE MATERIALS THAT ARE

00:52:55.772 --> 00:52:57.040
THAT ARE BEING USED THEIR THEIR

00:52:57.107 --> 00:52:58.575
MORE MORE OF A CONTACT TYPE

00:52:58.642 --> 00:53:00.777
MATERIAL. RATHER THAN A SYSTEMIC

00:53:00.844 --> 00:53:02.913
MATERIAL FOR THEM. TO GET

00:53:02.979 --> 00:53:05.415
COVERAGE AND IN DEAL YOU KNOW

00:53:05.482 --> 00:53:07.684
NOT BE POPULATIONS DOWN ONCE THE

00:53:07.751 --> 00:53:11.221
POPULATION IS HIGH IT'S VERY

00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:11.821
DIFFICULT ONCE THE PLANTS GET

00:53:11.888 --> 00:53:14.190
BIGGER. AND SO EVEN IN IN

00:53:14.257 --> 00:53:17.494
CONVENTIONAL- IT IT IS- WITH THE

00:53:17.561 --> 00:53:19.229
AVAILABILITY OF THE TEAM-

00:53:19.296 --> 00:53:20.430
INSECTICIDE THE VERY WAS

00:53:20.497 --> 00:53:22.799
REFERRING TO IT IN A VERY

00:53:22.866 --> 00:53:25.335
DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THEM. AND

00:53:25.402 --> 00:53:27.537
AS MARY MENTIONED WE WERE REALLY

00:53:27.604 --> 00:53:30.540
HELPFUL TO GET THIS- THE TWENTY

00:53:30.607 --> 00:53:32.309
FORTY FOR TORAK. BUT THAT WAS

00:53:32.375 --> 00:53:35.345
DENIED. AND THAT'S UNFORTUNATE

00:53:35.412 --> 00:53:37.781
AND- THAT WOULD HAVE GIVEN US

00:53:37.847 --> 00:53:39.516
ANOTHER TOOL AND THEN ALSO WITH

00:53:39.583 --> 00:53:42.152
HELP BUT IN- IN INSTANCE

00:53:42.218 --> 00:53:44.454
SAFEGUARDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF

00:53:44.521 --> 00:53:47.857
RESISTANCE TO THE EXISTING- THE

00:53:47.924 --> 00:53:49.526
INSECTICIDE THAT WE HAVE.

00:53:49.593 --> 00:53:51.461
ORGANIC PRODUCTION AND ASSEMBLY

00:53:51.528 --> 00:53:53.930
SALLY I THINK IS YOU KNOW- THE

00:53:53.997 --> 00:53:55.432
AG COMMISSIONER'S REPORT FOR

00:53:55.498 --> 00:53:58.335
MONTEREY COUNTY JUST CAME OUT

00:53:58.401 --> 00:54:01.037
ABOUT A MONTH AGO. AND IT DID IS

00:54:01.104 --> 00:54:02.572
IT REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN

00:54:02.639 --> 00:54:05.008
GROWING- EE I ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN

00:54:05.075 --> 00:54:06.543
CHARTING THE GROWTH OF THE

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:08.511
ORGANIC INDUSTRY SINCE THE- THE

00:54:08.578 --> 00:54:09.613
EARLY NINETIES WHEN THEY

00:54:09.679 --> 00:54:12.582
STARTED- KEEPING TRACK OF THE-

00:54:12.649 --> 00:54:16.386
THE VALUE. AND IN THE LAST- BUT

00:54:16.453 --> 00:54:18.254
IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THE NUMBER

00:54:18.321 --> 00:54:19.556
OF THE NUMBERS HAVE JUST BEEN

00:54:19.623 --> 00:54:22.192
INCREASING DRAMATICALLY. AND

00:54:22.258 --> 00:54:24.060
THERE'S A VERY VERY STRONG

00:54:24.127 --> 00:54:26.229
MARKET- FOR CANADA. AND WE'RE

00:54:26.296 --> 00:54:27.430
ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF A

00:54:27.497 --> 00:54:31.735
BILLION DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND

00:54:31.801 --> 00:54:33.703
TWENTY. AND AFTER THE TOTAL

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:36.473
ORGANIC- INDUSTRY AND SO IT'S A

00:54:36.539 --> 00:54:39.175
VERY SERIOUS BUSINESS HERE-

00:54:39.242 --> 00:54:43.647
THERE'S NO- YOU KNOW KIND OF-

00:54:43.713 --> 00:54:45.281
IT'S NOT LIKE LOOKED DOWN UPON

00:54:45.348 --> 00:54:47.217
IN ORGANIC IS PART OF THE

00:54:47.283 --> 00:54:48.952
BUSINESS THIS IS A GIFT IS

00:54:49.019 --> 00:54:51.321
ANNABELLE- ONE OF THE PROBLEMS

00:54:51.388 --> 00:54:53.156
WE HAVE THOUGH IS SAFEGUARDING

00:54:53.223 --> 00:54:55.692
THIS INDUSTRY FROM- ISSUES LIKE

00:54:55.759 --> 00:54:58.194
THIS. WHERE THIS COMES ALONG AND

00:54:58.261 --> 00:55:00.096
THEN IT'S MERRY MENTION NOW

00:55:00.163 --> 00:55:02.198
YOU'RE DOWN TO ONE MATERIAL TO

00:55:02.265 --> 00:55:04.668
TRY AND DEAL WITH IT AND- THAT'S

00:55:04.734 --> 00:55:08.304
A VERY PRECARIOUS SITUATION- TO-

00:55:08.371 --> 00:55:10.140
IT BEYOND THAT WE HAVE VERY

00:55:10.206 --> 00:55:11.875
LIMITED. OPTIONS FOR DEALING

00:55:11.941 --> 00:55:17.047
WITH- THIS TAKE A TRIP IN-

00:55:17.113 --> 00:55:19.115
ORGANIC PRODUCTION AND THEN THE

00:55:19.182 --> 00:55:21.618
RESULTING- ISSUES WITH BINEBI

00:55:21.685 --> 00:55:25.422
THAT. COME ABOUT AS A PART OF

00:55:25.488 --> 00:55:27.824
THAT- AND THEN ONE MORE THING IS

00:55:27.891 --> 00:55:29.693
MUCH. OF WE'VE BEEN WORKING

00:55:29.759 --> 00:55:32.562
WITH- WITH GROWERS IN

00:55:32.629 --> 00:55:35.265
CONTROLLING THE WEED HOSTS. AND

00:55:35.331 --> 00:55:36.499
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

00:55:36.566 --> 00:55:37.300
DURING THE WINTER WHEN THE

00:55:37.367 --> 00:55:39.669
LETTUCE IS NOT- PRESENT IN THE

00:55:39.736 --> 00:55:41.504
PRODUCTION FIELD THE VIRUSES

00:55:41.571 --> 00:55:44.274
OVERWINTERING. IN A RESIDENT

00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:47.243
PLAN AND WEEDS AND GO FOR IT AND

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:50.547
IT'S MERRY- LAID OUT AB- BENEFIT

00:55:50.613 --> 00:55:52.148
EXCELLENT JOB OF ORGANIZING THE

00:55:52.215 --> 00:55:53.683
GROWTH OF FORMING A TASK FORCE

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:55.118
IS WORKING WITH CALTRANS AND

00:55:55.185 --> 00:55:57.087
OTHER AGENCIES. AND DOING

00:55:57.153 --> 00:55:59.956
EDUCATION NEEDS- FOR THE GROWTH

00:56:00.023 --> 00:56:03.226
TO MAINTAIN- AT THIS IS VIDEO OF

00:56:03.293 --> 00:56:09.766
WE CONTROL IT THEY CANNOT FARMS. AND ROUNDING AREA. AND THEN-

00:56:09.833 --> 00:56:13.470
IF WILL IS TRICKY HAS AS-

00:56:13.536 --> 00:56:15.271
MENTION YOU KNOW A FULL BORDERS

00:56:15.338 --> 00:56:17.107
IN THE IS THE- OF- PLANT

00:56:17.173 --> 00:56:20.009
PATHOLOGY. THEY'RE GOAL BORDERS

00:56:20.076 --> 00:56:21.377
. ARE TRICKY BECAUSE YOU'RE

00:56:21.444 --> 00:56:23.546
DEALING. WITH THE MASSIVE FOIL

00:56:23.613 --> 00:56:24.414
THAT THESE PLANTS ARE GROWING

00:56:24.481 --> 00:56:30.019
IN. AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH

00:56:30.086 --> 00:56:34.124
A BUNCH OF FLIGHT CONTROL- NEEDS

00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:35.692
BUT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET

00:56:35.759 --> 00:56:37.327
THE MATERIALS ALL THE WAY

00:56:37.393 --> 00:56:41.064
THROUGH THE TOP PART OF THE ROOT

00:56:41.131 --> 00:56:43.032
SYSTEM TO GET EFFECTIVE. ALL AND

00:56:43.099 --> 00:56:44.434
SO WE YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WE'VE

00:56:44.501 --> 00:56:48.138
BEEN RUSTRATED- IN IN A CAMP.

00:56:48.204 --> 00:56:50.373
AND LOOKING AT THAT PARTICULAR

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:54.310
THAT PARTICULAR OPTION. AND SO

00:56:54.377 --> 00:56:57.180
YOU KNOW WITH THE SB ONE

00:56:57.247 --> 00:56:58.648
SEVENTEEN VERY EXCITED TO BE

00:56:58.715 --> 00:57:01.184
ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD AT A GOOD

00:57:01.251 --> 00:57:04.254
CLIP. TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.556
GOOD- INCREASE OUR UNDERSTANDING

00:57:06.623 --> 00:57:08.591
THE EPIDEMIOLOGY BIOLOGY OF

00:57:08.658 --> 00:57:11.261
THESE DISEASES. AND TO MITIGATE

00:57:11.327 --> 00:57:16.833
THEIR IMPACT. AND YOU KNOW TO

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:20.270
FURTHER- EVALUATE- VARIOUS-

00:57:20.336 --> 00:57:22.772
PESTICIDE BUT ALSO BIOLOGICAL

00:57:22.839 --> 00:57:25.141
BECAUSE THE THERE'S A THERE'S A

00:57:25.208 --> 00:57:27.977
GOOD. A LOT OF- DEVELOPMENT IN-

00:57:28.044 --> 00:57:29.813
MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY ON

00:57:29.879 --> 00:57:32.482
BIOLOGICAL WE WANT TO DEFINITELY

00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:34.317
LOOK AT THOSE TYPE THE MATERIAL.

00:57:34.384 --> 00:57:36.352
AND THEN OF COURSE- CULTURAL

00:57:36.419 --> 00:57:38.121
PRACTICES SUCH AS THE IRRIGATION

00:57:38.188 --> 00:57:39.956
MANAGEMENT THE FOURTH AND THEN

00:57:40.023 --> 00:57:41.357
IT'S MERRY MENTIONED UP-

00:57:41.424 --> 00:57:43.193
RESISTANT IS IT SOMETHING THAT

00:57:43.259 --> 00:57:47.597
REALLY NEEDS TO BE. EVALUATED

00:57:47.664 --> 00:57:48.398
AND THEN BETTER UNDERSTAND. I

00:57:48.464 --> 00:57:51.267
THINK THAT THE LEGISLATIVE-

00:57:51.334 --> 00:57:54.170
ASSEMBLY MEMBER EVEN. I THANK

00:57:54.237 --> 00:57:55.839
YOU RICHARD REALLY APPRECIATE

00:57:55.905 --> 00:57:58.808
YOUR WORK AND- YOUR COMMENTS

00:57:58.875 --> 00:58:01.277
AND- THE PRESENTATION AND I

00:58:01.344 --> 00:58:02.545
THINK ON THIS LAST POINT

00:58:02.612 --> 00:58:05.682
RESEARCH NEEDS. YOU KNOW AS IF

00:58:05.748 --> 00:58:07.116
YOU CAN REALLY BRIEFLY SPEAK AS

00:58:07.183 --> 00:58:09.919
YOU KNOW AS TO HOW THIS CURRENT

00:58:09.986 --> 00:58:11.688
FUNDING FOR THIS- THIS PREVIOUS

00:58:11.754 --> 00:58:14.457
BUDGET YEAR. YOU KNOW HOW YOU

00:58:14.524 --> 00:58:16.759
ANTICIPATE THAT YOU KNOW. THOSE

00:58:16.826 --> 00:58:18.194
DOLLARS ARE GOING TO BE USED IN

00:58:18.261 --> 00:58:20.897
AND HOW MUCH MORE FUNDING IF ANY

00:58:20.964 --> 00:58:22.031
IS GOING TO BE NEEDED DOWN THE

00:58:22.098 --> 00:58:24.767
ROAD AND WHAT MORE SHOULD OR

00:58:24.834 --> 00:58:28.805
COULD WE BE DOING AS A STATE. IN

00:58:28.872 --> 00:58:31.975
ADDITION TO JUST FUNDING. YEAH

00:58:32.041 --> 00:58:34.811
WELL I THINK- YOU KNOW CURRENTLY

00:58:34.878 --> 00:58:37.080
AS WE SPEAK THE CALL FOR

00:58:37.146 --> 00:58:39.782
PROPOSALS FOR THAT THAT FUNDING

00:58:39.849 --> 00:58:42.185
FOR FROM SB ONE SEVENTY. IS

00:58:42.252 --> 00:58:45.154
OPEN. TO FOR PEOPLE TO BE

00:58:45.221 --> 00:58:48.191
APPLYING FOR THE- THE FUN AND SO

00:58:48.258 --> 00:58:50.526
WE'RE GONNA- I THINK THERE'S A

00:58:50.593 --> 00:58:52.629
LOT O- RESEARCHERS THAT ARE

00:58:52.695 --> 00:58:54.163
GOING TO BE. YOU KNOW EXPLORE

00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:55.431
YOU KNOW PUTTING IN FOR FUNDING

00:58:55.498 --> 00:58:58.801
TO- TAKE A GOOD CAREFUL LOOK AT

00:58:58.868 --> 00:58:59.836
ALL THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED

00:58:59.903 --> 00:59:00.803
ABOUT YOU KNOW LIKE THE

00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:03.473
EPIDEMIOLOGY AND- BIOLOGY OF

00:59:03.539 --> 00:59:06.175
THESE OF THESE ORGANISMS. AND IN

00:59:06.242 --> 00:59:10.213
CONTROL- METHOD MEASURES. SO

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:12.282
THOSE- THAT THAT'S ALL GOING TO

00:59:12.348 --> 00:59:15.618
GETTING FUNDED- AND IN UNDER WAY

00:59:15.685 --> 00:59:17.887
IN IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHICH IS

00:59:17.954 --> 00:59:20.857
VERY EXCITING. AND I THINK THE

00:59:20.924 --> 00:59:22.425
REALITY IS WITH SOME OF THE

00:59:22.492 --> 00:59:24.494
THINGS BECAUSE YOU KNOW. AS YOU

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:26.396
KNOW ASSEMBLY REVISITS YOU'RE

00:59:26.462 --> 00:59:28.031
DEALING WITH A BIOLOGICAL

00:59:28.097 --> 00:59:31.167
SYSTEM. AND IF IT IS THE BIOLOGY

00:59:31.234 --> 00:59:33.636
IF THE WEATHER. AND ALL OF THESE

00:59:33.703 --> 00:59:37.473
OTHER COMPONENTS IN INTERACTING

00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:41.477
THAT- THAT MAKE THIS COMPLEX SO

00:59:41.544 --> 00:59:42.545
YOU KNOW CAN WE SOLVE THIS WHOLE

00:59:42.612 --> 00:59:45.114

SO I'M JUST GOING HAVING GIPSON

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:30.119
POINTS THAT I FEEL. GROWERS IN

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:32.121
GENERAL FEEL LIKE WHETHER THEIR

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:34.724
CONVENTIONAL GROWERS FOR ORGANIC

01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:40.096
GROWERS AND- BUT- I BELIEVE IS

01:01:40.163 --> 01:01:42.965
THAT WE FEEL LIKE THIS IS A TRUE

01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:46.569
DISASTER- AND SAW THAT THE SOME

01:01:46.636 --> 01:01:48.738
OF THE REASONS HERE WHY I FEEL

01:01:48.805 --> 01:01:50.273
THAT WAY AND YOU KNOW THE

01:01:50.339 --> 01:01:51.808
BIGGEST THING THAT WE'RE DOING

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:54.710
RIGHT NOW. AS GROWERS IS THAT WE

01:01:54.777 --> 01:01:59.282
ARE CHANGING WHERE WE PLANT-

01:01:59.348 --> 01:02:01.684
IT'S A HUGE GAPS IN GAME TIME WE

01:02:01.751 --> 01:02:04.987
STARTED BY. ROTATING OUR LETTUCE

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:06.989
AROUND THE RANCH IS TRYING TO

01:02:07.056 --> 01:02:09.492
AVOID WHAT WE THOUGHT MAYBE THE

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:11.627
PROBLEM AT THE END OR I AND S.

01:02:11.694 --> 01:02:14.397
B. AND SO WE MOVED OUR CLIENT

01:02:14.464 --> 01:02:17.233
TEAMS. IF WE COULD THROUGHOUT

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.802
THE RANCH TO TRY TO AVOID THESE

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:23.239
PROBLEMS- AND FROM THERE AS IT

01:02:23.306 --> 01:02:26.909
IS AS- AS THEY THE DISEASE GOT

01:02:26.976 --> 01:02:29.011
HIT SEVENTIES LOCATIONS. THAT WE

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:30.580
THOUGHT WE WOULD AVOID IT WE

01:02:30.646 --> 01:02:31.414
STARTED MOVING THE OTHER

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:34.984
COUNTIES- AND THEN FROM THERE

01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:36.419
THESE OTHER COUNTIES SO YOU'RE

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:38.187
TALKING SAN BENITO OR SANTA CRUZ

01:02:38.254 --> 01:02:40.490
COUNTY- ALSO ARE STARTING TO GET

01:02:40.556 --> 01:02:43.259
THIS DISEASE. SO NOW THE GROWERS

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:45.161
AND SHIPPERS ARE LOOKING TO

01:02:45.228 --> 01:02:48.664
OTHER AREAS- THAT WOULD BE

01:02:48.731 --> 01:02:51.968
EITHER OUTSIDE OF THE STATE OR

01:02:52.034 --> 01:02:54.971
EVEN OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY DOWN TO

01:02:55.037 --> 01:02:57.573
MEXICO TO TRY TO GROW LETTUCE TO

01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:00.610
AVOID THESE DISEASES. SO WHAT

01:03:00.676 --> 01:03:03.246
WHAT CONCERNS ME ABOUT THAT IS

01:03:03.312 --> 01:03:06.749
YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT- STAFF AND

01:03:06.816 --> 01:03:09.218
EMPLOYEES THAT WE HAVE BAD THIS

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:11.621
IS A JOB LOSS SITUATION WE'VE

01:03:11.687 --> 01:03:13.623
GOT FOUR INDUSTRY IF WE START

01:03:13.689 --> 01:03:16.692
MOVING OUR LETTUCE PRODUCTION

01:03:16.759 --> 01:03:24.033
OUTSIDE OF THE AREA- SO I. THAT

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:26.402
AT WE BEGIN AS THIS THING GETS

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:29.238
MORE ITS OWN A MATTER TIME THE-

01:03:29.305 --> 01:03:31.707
ALL OF OUR RANCH BEGAN INFECTED

01:03:31.774 --> 01:03:33.376
WITH PETER PYTHIUM R. I. N. S.

01:03:33.442 --> 01:03:35.378
B. WE'RE DOING OUR BEST TO

01:03:35.444 --> 01:03:38.247
CONTROL THE WEEDS. AND THE RAMPS

01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:40.116
BYE IT SEEMS LIKE WE CANNOT OUT

01:03:40.183 --> 01:03:43.319
RUN THIS THING- EVERY TIME WE

01:03:43.386 --> 01:03:44.921
TRY TO MAKE OUR BEST STAFF.

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:47.523
TOWARDS TRYING TO AVOID IT AND-

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:50.092
IT'S AN EXACT HONEST AND WE GET

01:03:50.159 --> 01:03:52.094
EITHER A PARTIAL WIPE OUT OF THE

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:54.764
FIELD OR WE GET ENTIRE LIFE OUT

01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:57.567
OF THE FIELD. AND THAT'S JUST

01:03:57.633 --> 01:03:59.535
IT'S DEVASTATING FOR THE GROWER

01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:02.738
AND THE INDUSTRY AND SO IT'S A

01:04:02.805 --> 01:04:04.607
VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION THAT

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:07.510
WERE PUT IN ON THIS SO THEN WHAT

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:12.215
DO WE DO- YOU KNOW. I FEEL LIKE

01:04:12.281 --> 01:04:13.916
SOMETIMES. THAT WORKS WORKS OF

01:04:13.983 --> 01:04:15.918
FLYING BLIND ON THIS- WHICH I

01:04:15.985 --> 01:04:17.086
DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE RIGHT

01:04:17.153 --> 01:04:19.655
TERM BY. WHAT HAPPENS IS WE IN

01:04:19.722 --> 01:04:22.158
SITUATIONS LIKE THIS IS THAT

01:04:22.225 --> 01:04:24.594
PAST CONTROL ADVISORS. MAIN

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:26.529
POSSIBLY OVER REACTING AGAIN

01:04:26.596 --> 01:04:28.497
THIS WOULD BE EITHER ORGANIC AND

01:04:28.564 --> 01:04:31.867
CONVENTIONAL- WHEN. THERE'S A

01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:34.370
PROBLEM THAT WE DON'T KNOW

01:04:34.437 --> 01:04:39.675
REALLY HOW TO SOLVE IT- WE TEND

01:04:39.742 --> 01:04:43.112
TO. OVER OVER REACTED- GROWERS

01:04:43.179 --> 01:04:45.414
ARE SCARED THAT THERE GONNA LOSE

01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:48.684
THEIR CROPS AND SO I THINK IT'S

01:04:48.751 --> 01:04:53.356
A VERY- IMPORTANT. ISSUE THAT WE

01:04:53.422 --> 01:04:54.890
GOT TO THINK ABOUT AS FAR AS

01:04:54.957 --> 01:04:57.727
PESTICIDE USE- THIS IS NOT THE

01:04:57.793 --> 01:05:00.329
RIGHT WAY TO CONTROL THIS. AND

01:05:00.396 --> 01:05:02.999
WE JUST NEED TO REALIZE YOU KNOW

01:05:03.065 --> 01:05:06.569
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING SO- SO

01:05:06.636 --> 01:05:08.170
ON THAT NOTE YOU KNOW WE'VE

01:05:08.237 --> 01:05:11.007
TRIED FOR SOME SECTION EIGHTEEN

01:05:11.073 --> 01:05:12.341
TO TWENTY FOUR SEIZE PERSON NEED

01:05:12.408 --> 01:05:15.411
TEN MYSTERY- BECAUSE OF THE FEAR

01:05:15.478 --> 01:05:17.380
OF THIS RESISTANCE TO MAP THE

01:05:17.446 --> 01:05:19.815
MALE. OR THE SPEND NO CENTERS

01:05:19.882 --> 01:05:21.550
FOR NELSON AS MERRY TALKED

01:05:21.617 --> 01:05:24.920
ABOUT- WE NEED A ROTATION WE

01:05:24.987 --> 01:05:27.356
NEED WE NEED SOMETHING THAT.

01:05:27.423 --> 01:05:28.858
PASSED CONTROL ADVISORS CAN

01:05:28.924 --> 01:05:31.260
ROTATE- WE JUST NEED SOMETHING

01:05:31.327 --> 01:05:33.029
NEW IN THE TOOLBOX WE'VE ONLY

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:35.364
GOT REALLY YOU KNOW A FEW FEW

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:39.869
OPTIONS. AND YOU KNOWWE NEED TO

01:05:39.935 --> 01:05:42.171
WE NEED TO FIND MORE. MORE TOOLS

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:46.676
THAT WE CAN. USE AS PAST CONTROL

01:05:46.742 --> 01:05:49.178
OF FIGHTERS- YOU KNOW THE END OF

01:05:49.245 --> 01:05:50.413
MY LIFE POINT IS KNOW THIS THING

01:05:50.479 --> 01:05:54.517
IS PUMP- WHEN WITH ROTATION AND

01:05:54.583 --> 01:05:58.154
WEEDS AND PERHAPS AN IRRIGATION.

01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:01.590
THE IT FEELS LIKE- YOU KNOW WE

01:06:01.657 --> 01:06:03.192
REALLY DON'T KNOW. WE DON'T KNOW

01:06:03.259 --> 01:06:06.462
WHAT WHAT TO DO NEXT SO WE NEED

01:06:06.529 --> 01:06:10.966
RESEARCH BIG TIME- I FEEL LIKE.

01:06:11.033 --> 01:06:12.835
I FEEL LIKE THAT THE THAT WE

01:06:12.902 --> 01:06:14.737
JUST WE DON'T KNOW WE'RE NOT

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:16.939
THAT MUCH FURTHER AHEAD NOW THAN

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:18.908
WE WERE YOU KNOW A FEW YEARS AGO

01:06:18.974 --> 01:06:21.143
I MEAN WE'VE MADE STRIDES BUT WE

01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:22.745
NEED MORE RESEARCH AND AGAIN

01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:24.413
IT'S BECAUSE IT'S VERY COMPLEX.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.781
I THINK WHAT WE'VE LEARNED

01:06:25.848 --> 01:06:27.583
THROUGH THIS TASK FORCE IS THAT

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.852
IT IS VERY COMPLEX AND IT'S MORE

01:06:29.919 --> 01:06:32.388
COMPLEX THAN WE THOUGHT IT WAS

01:06:32.455 --> 01:06:34.156
AND SO THAT'S WHY I MEAN. YOU

01:06:34.223 --> 01:06:36.659
KNOW THIS RESEARCH IS JUST GONNA

01:06:36.726 --> 01:06:42.198
BE OUT WE SOLVE THE PROBLEM SO-

01:06:42.264 --> 01:06:43.332
YOU KNOW THAT'S IT AS SHORT

01:06:43.399 --> 01:06:45.634
SLIDE BUT THAT'S- THAT'S KIND OF

01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:48.371
THE TAKE FROM THE FIELD. THANK

01:06:48.437 --> 01:06:49.805
YOU MARK I THINK YOU KNOW YOU'RE

01:06:49.872 --> 01:06:50.873
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THIS IS

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:52.274
INCREDIBLY COMPLEX BUT THE

01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:55.444
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THIS IS A

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:57.513
SERIOUS SERIOUS PROBLEM. AND

01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:59.148
THERE ARE NO CLEAR CUT- SOME

01:06:59.215 --> 01:07:01.650
STRATEGIES OR SOME SOLUTIONS ON

01:07:01.717 --> 01:07:06.655
ON HOW WE MANAGE AND HOW WE. WE-

01:07:06.722 --> 01:07:08.691
ARE GONNA MITIGATE THIS PROBLEM-

01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:10.426
BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW I

01:07:10.493 --> 01:07:13.596
THINK IT'S- IT'S CONCERNING-

01:07:13.662 --> 01:07:16.065
LOOK YOU KNOW AS YOU MENTIONED-

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:17.833
JUST LEARNING ABOUT THE GROWING

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:21.804
FOOTPRINT. OF D. YOU KNOW THESE

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:27.843
IMPACTED- FARMS AND- AND SITES.

01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:31.480
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA AS FAR AS-

01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:32.915
YOU KNOW THE IMPACTS OF I. N. S.

01:07:32.982 --> 01:07:35.484
B. AND IT'S A PITY IN WEALTH AND

01:07:35.551 --> 01:07:40.322
OTHER PARTS OF. OF OUR STATE YOU

01:07:40.389 --> 01:07:42.758
KNOW OUTSIDE OF. THE DID THE

01:07:42.825 --> 01:07:47.963
MONTEREY AND SAN BENITO REGION.

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:50.366
SO I YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW THE

01:07:50.433 --> 01:07:52.034
EXACT NUMBERS I CAN JUST TELL

01:07:52.101 --> 01:07:54.003
YOU WHAT I'VE HEARD BROUGH AND

01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:55.771
INDUSTRY IS THAT IT IS DOWN IN

01:07:55.838 --> 01:07:57.740
THE IN THE AREA- BUT I DON'T

01:07:57.807 --> 01:08:02.278
KNOW HOW BAD. IT IS- BUT THEY

01:08:02.344 --> 01:08:04.647

SANTA MARIA AREA ARE WATCHING

01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:21.330
THIS VERY CLOSELY BECAUSE THEIR

01:08:21.397 --> 01:08:25.067
PRODUCTION- SITUATION VERY

01:08:25.134 --> 01:08:27.303
SIMILAR TO HEAR ANY THEY HAVE

01:08:27.369 --> 01:08:29.538

THEM TO HAVE A FURIOUS HE'S USED

01:08:44.687 --> 01:08:46.755
TO THAT AS FAR AS WE KNOW THEY

01:08:46.822 --> 01:08:49.325
HAVEN'T HAD THE SEVERITY OF

01:08:49.391 --> 01:08:54.930

01:30:00.661 --> 01:30:03.297
JUST SHOW UP AT THE CABIN WOULD

01:30:03.364 --> 01:30:08.503
BE TRIGGER AND THAT WOULD GIVE. SIGNAL THAT THE TECHNICAL IS

01:30:08.569 --> 01:30:10.471
BACK IN THE FIELD BUT THAT IS

01:30:10.538 --> 01:30:14.375
WHY WE CANNOT SIMPLY RELY ON-

01:30:14.442 --> 01:30:15.943
ASSUMING THAT BY NOT A PLANT IN

01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:17.478
LETTERS WE'RE GONNA BE TAKING

01:30:17.545 --> 01:30:19.614
CARE OF THE ISSUE BECAUSE THE

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:21.082
PATH AGAIN WOULD EVENTUALLY SHOW

01:30:21.149 --> 01:30:24.051
UP. WHENEVER THEN- THE CROP BACK

01:30:24.118 --> 01:30:26.888
IF SAME WAY. WE HAVE TO BE VERY

01:30:26.954 --> 01:30:28.055
STRATEGIC IN A WAY THAT WE

01:30:28.122 --> 01:30:29.590
CONTROL THAT HAPPENED IN TWO

01:30:29.657 --> 01:30:31.626
STRIDES REDUCE THAT INOCULUM

01:30:31.692 --> 01:30:34.095
BUILD UP BECAUSE AS YOU SAW IN

01:30:34.162 --> 01:30:45.973
THAT. PREVIOUS SLIDE INTO CAN-

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:48.409
FAILED THAT. ARE HAVING. LIKE

01:30:48.476 --> 01:30:50.912
THIS WOULD ALSO HAVE. FOR OFTEN

01:30:50.978 --> 01:30:53.047
HAPPENED IN THIS. SO THIS WOULD

01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:54.715
BE SO FEEL THAT POTENTIAL. EVEN

01:30:54.782 --> 01:30:56.083
MEDICAL OF ARE RIGHT NOW YEAR

01:30:56.150 --> 01:30:58.152
WHAT MORE BE A GREATER RATE. OF

01:30:58.219 --> 01:30:59.887
THE DISEASE IN- AND NEXT YEAR

01:30:59.954 --> 01:31:00.955
BUT MAYBE MIGHT NOT BE NEXT

01:31:01.022 --> 01:31:02.123
BECAUSE WHETHER. ARE NOT

01:31:02.190 --> 01:31:03.324
CONDUCIVE TWENTY COULD BE THE

01:31:03.391 --> 01:31:05.226
FOLLOWING SO WE CANNOT JUST

01:31:05.293 --> 01:31:06.861
SIMPLY RELIED ON THE FACT THAT

01:31:06.928 --> 01:31:08.462
WE ONE YEAR WITH THE DISEASE AND

01:31:08.529 --> 01:31:10.431
THE OTHER NOT. WE ACTUALLY HAVE

01:31:10.498 --> 01:31:12.700
TO BE PROACTIVE IN WAYS TO

01:31:12.767 --> 01:31:14.602
REDUCE THAT INOCULUM BUILD UP

01:31:14.669 --> 01:31:18.105
BECAUSE THAT IS ULTIMATELY. THAT

01:31:18.172 --> 01:31:18.840
BUT THE WAY THAT WE WOULD BE

01:31:18.906 --> 01:31:21.142
ABLE TO MITIGATE ANY THINGS WHEN

01:31:21.209 --> 01:31:22.710
THEY'RE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT

01:31:22.777 --> 01:31:24.011
WE HAVE WITH THE AFFECT THAT

01:31:24.078 --> 01:31:26.013
EFFECTIVE YOU CAN EXPECT. IS SET

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:27.615
ASIDE THE TIME THAT YOU SEE THAT

01:31:27.682 --> 01:31:29.817
SYMPTOMS YOU CAN SEE HERE ON THE

01:31:29.884 --> 01:31:31.586
LEFT. IT'S HARD TO BELOW GROUND

01:31:31.652 --> 01:31:34.322
SYMPTOMS- YOU CAN SEE THE ROOTS.

01:31:34.388 --> 01:31:37.158
ARE COMPLETELY- THE PRODUCT IS

01:31:37.225 --> 01:31:38.259
VERY GOOD WITH THAT OUR DATA AND

01:31:38.326 --> 01:31:39.727
AS YOU MIGHT YOU WOULD SEE ON

01:31:39.794 --> 01:31:42.563
THE PICTURE ON THE VERY LEFT-

01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:45.466
CORNER AT THE BOTTOM- THAT RODDY

01:31:45.533 --> 01:31:48.002
IS CONCENTRATED OUTSIDE. OF

01:31:48.069 --> 01:31:51.372
THEIR ROUTE AND THAT IS- WATER

01:31:51.439 --> 01:31:54.242
BODIES VERY PARTICULAR UP THESE-

01:31:54.308 --> 01:31:55.643
YOU SEE THE DOG NOT INFECTED THE

01:31:55.710 --> 01:31:58.479
CROWN FOR THE INTERNAL. ISSUES

01:31:58.546 --> 01:32:00.114
OF THE ROUTE AND THAT'S WHY THE

01:32:00.181 --> 01:32:01.983
PLANTS DON'T DIE IMMEDIATELY SO

01:32:02.049 --> 01:32:03.951
YOU WOULD SEE ON THE PICTURE OUR

01:32:04.018 --> 01:32:05.653
WEATHER WITHIN THE BELOW GROUND

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:08.222
SECTION- THE PLAN FOR THE ROOTS

01:32:08.289 --> 01:32:10.057
ARE COMPLETELY NEW PRODUCT IN IN

01:32:10.124 --> 01:32:12.059
MEANS TO MANY OTHER THE ROUTE.

01:32:12.126 --> 01:32:13.728
BUT THE PASS SOME OF THE LEAST

01:32:13.794 --> 01:32:15.997
REMAIN VERY GREEN AND ACTUALLY

01:32:16.063 --> 01:32:18.532
LOOKS JUST FINE SMALLER BETTER

01:32:18.599 --> 01:32:21.035
FIND IN THAT IS ONE ACTUALLY ONE

01:32:21.102 --> 01:32:22.303
CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE WOULD BE

01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:25.139
IF THAT BY THE TIME THAT. THEY

01:32:25.206 --> 01:32:26.607
THINK THAT ARE SHOWING UP IT'S

01:32:26.674 --> 01:32:27.909
ALREADY TOO LATE AND THERE'S

01:32:27.975 --> 01:32:30.544
NOTHING WE CAN DO TO REVERSE.

01:32:30.611 --> 01:32:32.680
THE EFFECTS OF THE DISEASE SO WE

01:32:32.747 --> 01:32:34.181
HAVE TO BE PROACTIVE IN MAKING

01:32:34.248 --> 01:32:46.761
ME- PREVENTING THAT THIS IS TO

01:32:46.827 --> 01:32:48.162
OCCUR BY BY THE TIME THAT IT.

01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:51.132
SHOW UP IT'S A FAMILIAR AT THE

01:32:51.198 --> 01:32:51.732
CAN SEE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE

01:32:51.799 --> 01:32:54.902
OF IMAGE. THE RIGHT- THE IMAGE

01:32:54.969 --> 01:32:58.272
THE RIGHT. OF YOUR SCREEN- YEAH

01:32:58.339 --> 01:32:59.507
- YOU WOULD BE THAT THE RIGHT.

01:32:59.573 --> 01:33:00.608
THE PRESIDENT THERE IS A BIT A

01:33:00.675 --> 01:33:02.710
LARGE PLAN BASICALLY HELLO PLAN

01:33:02.777 --> 01:33:04.412
. IN YOU COULD SEE THE ATTACK OF

01:33:04.478 --> 01:33:06.147
THE DISEASE AFFECTED. TOWARDS

01:33:06.213 --> 01:33:08.649
LEFT IN WE DO THE SIZE OF THE-

01:33:08.716 --> 01:33:10.084
THAT THE- IN DOT IF THE PROBE.

01:33:10.151 --> 01:33:12.687
OF PROBABILITY IN HOW- THAT

01:33:12.753 --> 01:33:13.955
SEEMS TO OF THE ROUTE HOW

01:33:14.021 --> 01:33:16.257
OCCURRED. ALL THEY MORE THE PLAN

01:33:16.324 --> 01:33:17.725
IS DEFEAT. THE LONGER KIND OF

01:33:17.792 --> 01:33:18.826
THING FIELD WITH DOES NOT

01:33:18.893 --> 01:33:20.695
FUNCTION ROUTE. THEY MORE THE

01:33:20.761 --> 01:33:22.663
PLAN WOULD START SPRING CAMP. IN

01:33:22.730 --> 01:33:24.165
THE WAY THAT THE KIND WOULD TRY

01:33:24.231 --> 01:33:25.633
TO GET. SOME OF THE LEAST WHAT

01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:27.768
IF THERE WORLD IN OUT. THERE ONE

01:33:27.835 --> 01:33:29.403
OF THE MAIN TELLING GIVE UP YOU

01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:31.405
WOULD SEE. IN THE- THE FLAG

01:33:31.472 --> 01:33:33.240
EFFECTIVE SYMPTOMS. REMAINED

01:33:33.307 --> 01:33:36.277
RESEMBLE WATER STRESS PLAN. FOR

01:33:36.344 --> 01:33:37.912
YOUR RECORDS WOULD OFTEN

01:33:37.979 --> 01:33:40.114
MISTAKEN. THEY SENTENCED BY THE

01:33:40.181 --> 01:33:42.316
PLANTS NEED MORE WATER AND HOW

01:33:42.383 --> 01:33:45.119
DID WAS VERY ACCURATELY-

01:33:45.186 --> 01:33:47.922
MENTIONED. BY YOU IN IN YOUR

01:33:47.989 --> 01:33:50.191
INTRODUCTION COMMENT THESE ARE

01:33:50.257 --> 01:33:52.727
THE HAPPENED IN PRETTY TO. THE

01:33:52.793 --> 01:33:54.595
SPORTS SWIMMING AND SPORTS. THIS

01:33:54.662 --> 01:33:56.197
IS KIND OF LIKE A PERFECT STORM

01:33:56.263 --> 01:33:57.765
SITUATION BECAUSE THE PLANTS

01:33:57.832 --> 01:33:59.900
LOOK LIKE NEED WATER. GROWERS

01:33:59.967 --> 01:34:02.403
PUT MORE WATER IN THEM DAYS

01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:04.472
SPREAD THEIR SPORES. DESERVE

01:34:04.538 --> 01:34:06.173
SWIMMING SPORT ARE SPREAD

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:07.441
THROUGHOUT THE FEEL IN BATH WHEN

01:34:07.508 --> 01:34:09.744
YOU SEE AN OVERALL COVERAGE OF

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:11.579
THE FIELD LIKE YOU SAW IN THE

01:34:11.645 --> 01:34:24.258
PREVIOUS LIFE. EXACTLY HERE

01:34:24.325 --> 01:34:26.827
YEAH- ONE. OF WHAT YOU WERE LIKE

01:34:26.894 --> 01:34:28.829
TO WOULD IN THE- ON THE LEFT YOU

01:34:28.896 --> 01:34:30.798
SEE IF THERE ARE. SOME HEALTHY

01:34:30.865 --> 01:34:33.434
FOR SOME DRAMATIC. THAT DOT AND

01:34:33.501 --> 01:34:34.468
WE LOOK MORE CLOSELY. AND YOU

01:34:34.535 --> 01:34:36.670
CAN SEE THAT OF THE- THERE WITH

01:34:36.737 --> 01:34:39.073
FROM. RE AND IN THERE ARE NO.

01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:40.274
LONGER ROUTES WERE. WHAT THE

01:34:40.341 --> 01:34:42.009
USES TO UP SO WATER NORTH THAT

01:34:42.076 --> 01:34:45.846
THE IS WHY. THE PLAN FOR- YOU

01:34:45.913 --> 01:34:48.182
CAN CLICK. AND OF THE OF YOUR

01:34:48.249 --> 01:34:50.384
SEE AT HAD FIFTY FOUR AND WITHIN

01:34:50.451 --> 01:34:56.757
COURTS. I'LL BE WORK IMAGES

01:34:56.824 --> 01:34:58.125
THERE WERE TAKEN UNDER SAME SPOT

01:34:58.192 --> 01:34:59.160
EVERY THREE WEEK SO YOU GET THE

01:34:59.226 --> 01:35:01.095
LEFT. IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY NOW-

01:35:01.162 --> 01:35:02.730
FIVE WEEKS AFTER. WE ARE THEIR-

01:35:02.797 --> 01:35:04.331
PLAN THAT LOOKS HERE. THANK

01:35:04.398 --> 01:35:05.533
WATER. IT DOES LOOK LIKE THE

01:35:05.599 --> 01:35:07.568
PLANET WHY MAYBE. THE ONE TO GET

01:35:07.635 --> 01:35:10.004
IN WATER OUT WE PRO. THREE WEEKS

01:35:10.071 --> 01:35:15.009
LATER. MMHM ARE THE PLAN THAT WE

01:35:15.076 --> 01:35:17.311
HAVE SIR. DAN THREE WERE LATER

01:35:17.378 --> 01:35:18.779
SAW THE- IN WITH MORE. IN THE

01:35:18.846 --> 01:35:21.115
AREA NOW IT'S SHOWING THE SAME

01:35:21.182 --> 01:35:22.583
TO. AND THEN THREE WEEKS BY

01:35:22.650 --> 01:35:23.384
ELEVEN WEEKS AFTER PUBLIC

01:35:23.451 --> 01:35:25.186
CAMPAIGN YOU SEE THAT THERE

01:35:25.252 --> 01:35:27.788
MORTARBOARD THERE WERE MANY MORE

01:35:27.855 --> 01:35:28.489
PLANTS ALREADY SHOWING THE

01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:31.025
SYMPTOMS. ONE MORE AND EVEN MORE

01:35:31.092 --> 01:35:32.626
IMPORTANTLY SOME PLANS THAT WERE

01:35:32.693 --> 01:35:35.096
ALREADY COMPLETELY GONE-

01:35:35.162 --> 01:35:36.730
PRESUMABLY. THE PLANS THAT WERE

01:35:36.797 --> 01:35:37.932
INFECTED FIRST BECAUSE THE

01:35:37.998 --> 01:35:40.067
SECOND I'VE I'VE HAD SITUATION

01:35:40.134 --> 01:35:44.105
WHEN PLAN THAT. EFFECTIVE PLANT.

01:35:44.171 --> 01:35:45.506
THE FULL CLOSER TO BE NOTHING

01:35:45.573 --> 01:35:47.908
IMPORTANT- NEWER PLANTS SO IF

01:35:47.975 --> 01:35:49.176
IT'S SOMETHING THAT THROUGHOUT

01:35:49.243 --> 01:35:52.213
THE SEASON WE COULD SEE CONTINUE

01:35:52.279 --> 01:35:53.814
- INFECTION SHOWING UP

01:35:53.881 --> 01:35:55.316
ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE RIGHT.

01:35:55.382 --> 01:36:01.455
ENVIRONMENTAL. CONDITIONS ARE

01:36:01.522 --> 01:36:04.391
PRESENT. SO NEXT. TO WHAT WE ARE

01:36:04.458 --> 01:36:06.327
TRYING TO- COMPANIES IN WE'VE

01:36:06.393 --> 01:36:08.796
BEEN. ON THE- MARKKANEN'S VERY

01:36:08.863 --> 01:36:10.564
ACCURATE. WITH COMING UP WITH

01:36:10.631 --> 01:36:15.336
PRIOR OF- FOR MANAGING DISEASE

01:36:15.402 --> 01:36:16.770
BUT IT HAS BEEN BASED ON THE

01:36:16.837 --> 01:36:18.272
LIMITATIONS OF THE FUNDING

01:36:18.339 --> 01:36:19.707
CAPACITY IN THE FUNDING

01:36:19.773 --> 01:36:21.442
RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE BEEN

01:36:21.509 --> 01:36:23.644
GIVEN UP UNTIL NOW. WE HAVE ONLY

01:36:23.711 --> 01:36:28.048
BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM

01:36:28.115 --> 01:36:31.385
I'M VERY- SHORT TERM- WAY IF WE

01:36:31.452 --> 01:36:33.754
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EVERY YEAR TRY

01:36:33.821 --> 01:36:36.056
DIFFERENT NEW THINK BASED ON THE

01:36:36.123 --> 01:36:37.958
CONDITIONS THAT ARE SHOWING.

01:36:38.025 --> 01:36:40.261
YEAH EVERY YEAR STARTING IN

01:36:40.327 --> 01:36:41.495
TWENTY TWENTY WE WERE OBSOLETE

01:36:41.562 --> 01:36:44.131
VISIONARY AND I WE WERE AHEAD OF

01:36:44.198 --> 01:36:47.101
THE ISSUE AND THAT IS SOMETHING

01:36:47.168 --> 01:36:49.203
THAT WE WOULD ALWAYS. BE

01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:51.071
APPRECIATIVE OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:36:51.138 --> 01:36:53.240
RESEARCH- LET CALIFORNIA LEAFY

01:36:53.307 --> 01:36:55.142
GREENS RESEARCH PROGRAM THAT

01:36:55.209 --> 01:36:56.744
STATE FUNDED THAT RESEARCH

01:36:56.810 --> 01:36:59.113
COMPETITION WILL BE FOR THE

01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:00.981
OUTBREAK HAPPENED SO IT ALLOWED

01:37:01.048 --> 01:37:02.816
US TO ACTUALLY HAVE A PROJECT

01:37:02.883 --> 01:37:06.086
ON. ONGOING PROJECTS BEFORE THEY

01:37:06.153 --> 01:37:08.322
AND THEIR THEIR WARDS PART OF

01:37:08.389 --> 01:37:10.591
THE OUTBREAK I HAPPEN TO EITHER

01:37:10.658 --> 01:37:15.396
THEY EACH OF THE INTAKE. OF

01:37:15.462 --> 01:37:15.963
COMPLETELY BY SURPRISE. EVEN

01:37:16.030 --> 01:37:17.765
THOUGH IT TOOK WITH OUR HANDS

01:37:17.831 --> 01:37:19.466
AND FEET HI GOOD YOU KNOW HOW TO

01:37:19.533 --> 01:37:22.102
MANAGE IT- BUT LAST YEAR WITH

01:37:22.169 --> 01:37:24.104
OTHER EASTERN A WEEK. WAS THE

01:37:24.171 --> 01:37:28.475
LACK. OF THE TV SHOW UP MORTON-

01:37:28.542 --> 01:37:29.710
LATE IN THE BECAUSE OF THE

01:37:29.777 --> 01:37:30.511
CHANGES IN THE WEATHER

01:37:30.578 --> 01:37:32.646
CONDITIONS WE WERE LIMITED IN A

01:37:32.713 --> 01:37:34.882
WAY THAT HOW HOW TO PROVIDE-

01:37:34.949 --> 01:37:37.184
MANAGEMENT ALTERNATIVE TO COURTS

01:37:37.251 --> 01:37:38.786
TO WIN THIS NEW SOURCE OF

01:37:38.852 --> 01:37:42.656
FUNDING. WHAT WE ARE- ARE HOPING

01:37:42.723 --> 01:37:44.258
TO ADDRESS THESE COMPLEMENT SOME

01:37:44.325 --> 01:37:45.459
OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:37:45.526 --> 01:37:47.261
DOING AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE

01:37:47.328 --> 01:37:49.129
THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING THE FROM

01:37:49.196 --> 01:37:51.232
THE STANDPOINT. OF NOT JUST

01:37:51.298 --> 01:37:53.867
PROMOTING THE USE FOR MORE

01:37:53.934 --> 01:37:55.736
CHEMICAL APPLICATIONS WE ARE NOT

01:37:55.803 --> 01:37:58.739
PROMOTING OR ADVERTISING THE USE

01:37:58.806 --> 01:38:00.708
OF SOLAR FUMIGANTS BUT INSTEAD

01:38:00.774 --> 01:38:05.846
WE ARE TRYING TO COME UP. WITH

01:38:05.913 --> 01:38:06.347
AN INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT

01:38:06.413 --> 01:38:07.281
APPROACH. OR WE COULD HAVE ARE

01:38:07.348 --> 01:38:11.051
TO A- OUR INTER INTO THE EVENING

01:38:11.118 --> 01:38:13.621
. AND FINNERTY'S OF DIFFERENT

01:38:13.687 --> 01:38:17.891
STRATEGIES. INCLUDING CLICK-

01:38:17.958 --> 01:38:19.393
YEAH LOOKING AT WHAT IS THE

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:20.728
EFFECT OF IRRIGATION LIKE I

01:38:20.794 --> 01:38:22.663
MENTIONED THE WATER PLAYS A ROLE

01:38:22.730 --> 01:38:24.265
IN THE DISTRIBUTION ND ALSO THE

01:38:24.331 --> 01:38:25.633
BIOLOGY OF THIS FACTORED INTO

01:38:25.699 --> 01:38:27.768
HOW WE CAN MANAGE THE WATER

01:38:27.835 --> 01:38:30.304
MORE- IT'S RIDICULOUS YOU KNOW

01:38:30.371 --> 01:38:31.572
WITH THAT WE ARE GIVEN DIFFERENT

01:38:31.639 --> 01:38:33.307
ACROSS THE WATER THAT THEY NEED

01:38:33.374 --> 01:38:34.808
TO BUT WE'RE NOT GIVEN EXTRA

01:38:34.875 --> 01:38:37.278
WATER. THAT MAKES IT EASY EVEN

01:38:37.344 --> 01:38:39.213
AWARD- PROPER PATIENT IN A WAY

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:41.548
THAT WHAT HAPPENS IF WE TAKE THE

01:38:41.615 --> 01:38:44.451
LEAD TO WAY FOR S. SEASON FOUR

01:38:44.518 --> 01:38:45.552
TO SEASON AND THEN WE PUT IT

01:38:45.619 --> 01:38:47.755
BACK AGAIN WHAT COULD BE HOW CAN

01:38:47.821 --> 01:38:49.290
WE FIND THIS PROBLEM WITH

01:38:49.356 --> 01:38:50.624
PATIENT THAT WOULD REDUCE THAT

01:38:50.691 --> 01:38:52.826
HAPPENED IN. INOCULUM BUILD UP

01:38:52.893 --> 01:38:54.161
IN THE STORE OR PROVIDED TIME

01:38:54.228 --> 01:38:56.030
THAT WE PUT THAT UP AGAIN WE ARE

01:38:56.096 --> 01:38:58.299
NOT A PLAN GENE THE LETTER IN A

01:38:58.365 --> 01:39:00.668
FIELD COMPLETELY INFECTED WITH

01:39:00.734 --> 01:39:03.237
THE PATHOGEN. AND WE'RE LOOKING

01:39:03.304 --> 01:39:04.505
VERY CLOSELY AT WHAT IS THE

01:39:04.571 --> 01:39:05.639
EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL

01:39:05.706 --> 01:39:06.940
CONDITIONS WE KNOW THAT THIS

01:39:07.007 --> 01:39:08.709
HAPPENED IN BENEFITS FRAUD

01:39:08.776 --> 01:39:11.145
WARMER SOILS ANYTHING YOU COULD

01:39:11.211 --> 01:39:13.347
IMAGINE THAT- IF IT'S SOMETHING

01:39:13.414 --> 01:39:15.449
THAT WE ANY EXCLUSIVELY LAST

01:39:15.516 --> 01:39:16.917
YEAR WE OBSERVE WITH THE YEARS.

01:39:16.984 --> 01:39:19.253
OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE-

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:21.355
WARMER IF SOLD WORK ALSO

ARMENIAN DOT L. TO ACCELERATE

01:39:23.524 --> 01:39:25.059
THEIR BIOLOGICAL CYCLE UP TO

01:39:25.125 --> 01:39:27.061
PASS AGAINST- IN THIS SORT OF

01:39:27.127 --> 01:39:28.662
THE WE'RE LOOKING CLOSELY AT

01:39:28.729 --> 01:39:30.597
THAT BUT ALSO LOOKING AT WHAT IT

01:39:30.664 --> 01:39:32.766
MIGHT BE SOME HOPE OF A RECEIPT

01:39:32.833 --> 01:39:34.435
SENT. OUT SIGNATURE THAT WE

01:39:34.501 --> 01:39:36.804
MIGHT BE AND WHETHER WE CAN TAKE

01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:38.072
ADVANTAGE COST PLANTS ARE

01:39:38.138 --> 01:39:40.040
CULTIVATED THAT ARE NOT.

01:39:40.107 --> 01:39:41.775

BACK CIRCLE ON THE TOP RIGHT

01:39:43.911 --> 01:39:46.613
CORNER DID YOU WOULD BE YOU HAVE

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:48.349
TO IN THE SAME FIELD TO VARIETY

01:39:48.415 --> 01:39:50.851
IS ON THE LEFT ONE THAT SEEMS TO

01:39:50.918 --> 01:39:52.853
BE NOT AFFECTED IN ONE ON THE

01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:54.888
RIGHT ONE THAT I. WHAT

01:39:54.955 --> 01:39:57.324
COMPLETELY DEVASTATED- AND TAKEN

01:39:57.391 --> 01:39:59.059
DOWN BY THE DEFEATS ABOUT IS

01:39:59.126 --> 01:40:00.294
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:40:00.361 --> 01:40:01.895
GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING

01:40:01.962 --> 01:40:03.364
WATER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD

01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:05.766
BE USING NOT ONLY COMMERCIALLY

01:40:05.833 --> 01:40:18.345
BUT ALSO BE USING. FOR BREEDING

01:40:20.114 --> 01:40:23.150
SAME TIME. THE OLD. WAY TO-

01:40:23.217 --> 01:40:24.885
TESTING MORE EFFECTIVE AND- WAYS

01:40:24.952 --> 01:40:26.286
ABUSE IN. AND WE ARE NOT.

WE STILL HAVE SOME CAMERA. THAT

01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:35.896
ARE DEFECT I CAN THIS- THIS. IN

ALL OUR- RESURGENCE RODRIGUEZ IS

01:41:44.398 --> 01:41:46.166
BY MAKING SURE THAT ALL THE

01:41:46.233 --> 01:41:48.135
DISCOVERED ALL THE FINDINGS THAT

01:41:48.202 --> 01:41:51.071
WE HAVE. WE ARE HELPING THEM IN

GROWERS IN COMMERCIAL FIELD BUT

01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:02.115
ALSO IN RESEARCH- IF THEY HAVE.

01:42:02.182 --> 01:42:04.651
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO NOT A-

LI AYE PART I RECALLED FROM OF

01:43:03.544 --> 01:43:06.146
MAKE. AND WE BEEN WORK UNTIL

01:43:06.213 --> 01:43:08.415
VERY ACTIVELY WITH US FROM THE

01:43:08.482 --> 01:43:09.750
COMMUNITIES. FOR MY ARM

01:43:09.816 --> 01:43:11.652
SUFFICIENT BUT ALSO FRONT-

01:43:11.718 --> 01:43:13.520
HOLDER EVEN UNIVERSE. ENGAGE

01:43:13.587 --> 01:43:15.989
THEM INTO TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS

01:43:16.056 --> 01:43:18.091
QUESTION GETTING THEM INFORMED

01:43:18.158 --> 01:43:20.193
ABOUT A WATER IN CHALLENGES IN

01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:22.696
NEED- DIFFERENT DISEASES HAVE

BECOME OR CONTENT OF OUR FORTY

01:43:26.133 --> 01:43:27.267
FIFTH IN A WAY THAT IS STUDENTS

01:43:27.334 --> 01:43:29.303
ARE TRYING. TO COME UP WINNERS

01:43:29.369 --> 01:43:31.605
OF PROBLEM SOLVING SOLUTIONS

01:43:31.672 --> 01:43:35.509
FOUR DAYS- FORTY FIFTY FIFTY- WE

01:43:35.576 --> 01:43:36.910
CAN GET THERE DEFINITELY THE

01:43:36.977 --> 01:43:38.412
FUNDING FROM THE S. B. ONE SEVEN

01:43:38.478 --> 01:43:40.881
IT WHAT ALLOW TO KEEP SUPPORTING

01:43:40.948 --> 01:43:42.683
LOCAL STUDENTS TO ENGAGE IN

01:43:42.749 --> 01:43:44.952
THESE. RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES

01:43:45.018 --> 01:43:47.654
AND ALSO GAIN KEEPING. IF THE

01:43:47.721 --> 01:43:49.489
BALLOT BEING THAT COMMITMENT IN

01:43:49.556 --> 01:43:50.991
THAT ENGAGEMENT WITH THEIR

01:43:51.058 --> 01:43:53.594
INDUSTRY TO TRY TO SOLVE. THEIR

01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:54.995
CHALLENGES AND NEEDS THAT

01:43:55.062 --> 01:43:56.597
BETWEEN THE THREE HAVE- IN

01:43:56.663 --> 01:43:59.333
ADDITION. WE SEE THIS ARE THE

01:43:59.399 --> 01:44:02.936
TWO WAYS- APPROACH IN A SENSE

01:44:03.003 --> 01:44:05.038
THAT WE ARE NOT ONLY TRAINING

01:44:05.105 --> 01:44:07.140
HARD IN THIS REGARD FOR OUR

01:44:07.207 --> 01:44:10.110
WORKFORCE WE'RE ALSO. AND IN A

01:44:10.177 --> 01:44:11.411
WAY TO ADDRESSING SOME OF THE

01:44:11.478 --> 01:44:13.447
LABOR SHORTAGES THAT WE HAVE IN

01:44:13.513 --> 01:44:15.148
THE NEEDS THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS

01:44:15.215 --> 01:44:17.718
FOR MORE TECHNICALLY TRAINED- I

01:44:17.784 --> 01:44:19.686
WORK FOR IS THAT CURRENTLY IS

01:44:19.753 --> 01:44:22.222
NEEDED. IN IN AN INDUSTRY BUT

01:44:22.289 --> 01:44:24.591
ALSO WE'RE GIVEN EXPANDING. THE

01:44:24.658 --> 01:44:25.559
WAY THAT WE SHARED THIS

01:44:25.626 --> 01:44:27.194
INFORMATION NOT ONLY IN THE

01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:29.363
CLASSROOM BUT ALSO WITH FARM

01:44:29.429 --> 01:44:30.597
WORKERS AND PEOPLE IN THE

01:44:30.664 --> 01:44:32.399
INDUSTRY ALL THE MEMBERS OF THIS

01:44:32.466 --> 01:44:42.709
COMMITTEE. THAT ARE HERE TODAY

01:44:42.776 --> 01:44:45.045
OF. ROUTINELY IN IN- SEX WHERE

01:44:45.112 --> 01:44:47.681
WE SHARE. OUR- KNOWLEDGE. AND

01:44:47.748 --> 01:44:49.249
RESPECT. WITH MEMBERS OF THE

01:44:49.316 --> 01:44:50.651
INDUSTRY INTO PARMA IN THEIR

THEIR EFFECT. IN ANY INTEREST

01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:55.722
FOR EVEN IN ONLY DO FULL WHAT ON

01:44:55.789 --> 01:44:58.158
THE TECH ROLE. AT THE FAR. BUT

01:44:58.225 --> 01:44:58.992
ALSO TRAIN SOME OF THE FAR MORE

01:44:59.059 --> 01:45:01.828
THAT ARE. ON THE GO IN FIELD

01:45:01.895 --> 01:45:03.930
ACCERN. SEEN THE SEASON IN A WAY

01:45:03.997 --> 01:45:07.034
THAT THEY CAN OPEN UP THESE THE

01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:08.935
- THEY ARE A TOWARD. THE THEY

01:45:09.002 --> 01:45:10.337
CAN ALSO. THEIR MANAGER THEIR

01:45:10.404 --> 01:45:12.739
PCA'S- IN A WAY THAT WE GET MORE

01:45:12.806 --> 01:45:15.075
PROACTIVELY CAN AND IMPORTANTLY

01:45:15.142 --> 01:45:17.110
RESPOND TODAY. THE THING THAT

01:45:17.177 --> 01:45:20.280
HAVE SO I WANT TO THANK- ALL.

01:45:20.347 --> 01:45:21.948
FOR THE SUPPORT THAT HAS BEEN

01:45:22.015 --> 01:45:24.651
GIVEN. TO US FOR THE S. B. ONE

01:45:24.718 --> 01:45:25.318
SEVENTY AND I WANTED TO

01:45:25.385 --> 01:45:27.721
EMPHASIZE THAT. THE RESEARCH IS

01:45:27.788 --> 01:45:30.223
DEFINITELY NEEDED. THIS IS THE

01:45:30.290 --> 01:45:31.324
FUNDING OF WHAT A LOT OF COULD

01:45:31.391 --> 01:45:33.060
TAKE THEIR RESEARCH AND COME UP

01:45:33.126 --> 01:45:35.262
WITH MORE. OF A START THE

01:45:35.328 --> 01:45:37.164
FEATURES MORE SYSTEMATICALLY IN

01:45:37.230 --> 01:45:39.099
A WAY THAT WE CAN LOOK. COME UP

01:45:39.166 --> 01:45:41.168
WHEN NOT ONLY WAITED A SHORT

01:45:41.234 --> 01:45:42.803
TERM SOLUTION BUT ACTUALLY MORE

01:45:42.869 --> 01:45:52.112
ROBUST ALTERNATIVE THAT. WOULD

01:45:52.179 --> 01:45:54.314
BE MORE- AT FIFTEEN EVEN IF THE

01:45:54.381 --> 01:45:55.382
THEM TO DITCH. IN THE CLASS THAT

01:45:55.449 --> 01:45:57.250
WE SEE FOR YEAR TO YEAR WE IDEAS

01:45:57.317 --> 01:45:58.719
COME UP WITH ALL. THAT WOULD NOT

01:45:58.785 --> 01:46:01.021
NECESSARY. E OVERTAKEN BY THE

01:46:01.088 --> 01:46:02.823
POWER OR NOT BE AFFECTED BY THE

01:46:02.889 --> 01:46:03.557
FACT THAT THE WEATHER CHANGED

01:46:03.623 --> 01:46:05.025
FROM ONE YEAR THE OTHER ONE BUT

01:46:05.092 --> 01:46:06.159
WE WOULD BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE

01:46:06.226 --> 01:46:08.195
IT. IS FACTORED IN THE WAY TO

01:46:08.261 --> 01:46:10.063
COMING UP WITH ALTERNATIVES WHAT

MOVE TO OUR LAST MEMBER OF THIS

01:47:03.650 --> 01:47:13.193
PANEL OF A- OF THIS PANEL. RIGHT

01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:15.228
NOW I'VE ALREADY FIGURED OUT HOW

01:47:15.295 --> 01:47:24.771
TO WORK. THE AIR. I HAVE IN THE

01:47:24.838 --> 01:47:27.374
CENTER MODE AND I'M NOT SURE HOW

01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:32.345
THE- IT GOT OUT YOU KNOW. YEAH I

01:47:32.412 --> 01:47:35.048
KNOW OUR TEAM BUT I HAVEN'T

01:47:35.115 --> 01:47:37.884
LOOKED AT IT IT- IT LOOKS FINE

01:47:37.951 --> 01:47:40.320
ON OUR END AS WELL. OKAY OKAY

01:47:40.387 --> 01:47:43.223
GREAT PERFECT SO HEY- THANK YOU

01:47:43.290 --> 01:47:45.392
AGAIN FOR- ALLOWING ME TO

01:47:45.458 --> 01:47:47.260
PRESENT- SOME OF THE RESEARCH

01:47:47.327 --> 01:47:49.129
AND SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT

01:47:49.196 --> 01:47:50.096
WE'VE CONDUCTED HERE ON TRIPS

01:47:50.163 --> 01:47:52.632
AND- IMPATIENCE NIKADA BOTTLERS

01:47:52.699 --> 01:47:54.301
IN A RESEARCH ENTOMOLOGIST WITH

01:47:54.367 --> 01:47:56.603
USDA AND KILLING US. I STARTED

01:47:56.670 --> 01:47:58.772
HERE IN THE SUMMER OF TWO

01:47:58.839 --> 01:47:59.372
THOUSAND NINETEEN AND THIS IS

01:47:59.439 --> 01:48:01.541
BECOME REALLY A TOP PRIORITY FOR

01:48:01.608 --> 01:48:03.276
MY RESEARCH PROGRAM TO REALLY

01:48:03.343 --> 01:48:07.280
SUPPORT THE LEAFY GREENS

01:48:07.347 --> 01:48:07.848
INDUSTRY HERE IN THE SALINAS

01:48:07.914 --> 01:48:11.418
DOLLARS. DR SO REALLY BRIEFLY I

01:48:11.484 --> 01:48:12.819
THINK A LOT OF YOU HAVE SEEN

01:48:12.886 --> 01:48:14.487
PICTURES OF MINE AND HE JUST

01:48:14.554 --> 01:48:15.488
GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF THE

01:48:15.555 --> 01:48:17.290
BACKSTORY OF THE VIRUS WAS FIRST

01:48:17.357 --> 01:48:18.792
DESCRIBED IN THE NETHERLANDS IN

01:48:18.859 --> 01:48:21.795
THE EIGHTIES- AND IT WASN'T

01:48:21.862 --> 01:48:23.597
REPORTED UNTIL TWO THOUSAND

01:48:23.663 --> 01:48:25.332
SIX'S RICHARD SMITH MENTIONED IN

01:48:25.398 --> 01:48:26.900
IN HIS PRESENTATION MONTEREY

01:48:26.967 --> 01:48:29.936
COUNTY IN LOTUS- AND THEN FROM

01:48:30.003 --> 01:48:30.971
TWO THOUSAND SIX IN TWO THOUSAND

01:48:31.037 --> 01:48:32.172
TWELVE WE SAW SOME REALLY MINOR

01:48:32.239 --> 01:48:35.242
TO SEVERE ISOLATED OUTBREAKS IT

01:48:35.308 --> 01:48:38.545
WASN'T REALLY UNTIL TWO THOUSAND

01:48:38.612 --> 01:48:39.179
EIGHTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY

01:48:39.246 --> 01:48:40.146
ONE WE ONLY STARTED TO SING THE

01:48:40.213 --> 01:48:41.915
RECEIVE THE RE EMERGENCE OF THIS

01:48:41.982 --> 01:48:43.884
VIRUS. AND SEVERE OPERATIONS

01:48:43.950 --> 01:48:46.052
THROUGHOUT MONTEREY COUNTY- AND

01:48:46.119 --> 01:48:47.387
SOME OTHER COASTAL LETTUCE

01:48:47.454 --> 01:48:49.522
REGIONS- AND AS MARY MENTIONED

01:48:49.589 --> 01:48:53.493
UP TO A 100% CROP LOSSES- A BIG-

01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:56.096
ECONOMIC IMPACT AND ONE OF YOUR

01:48:56.162 --> 01:48:57.564
QUESTIONS TO MARK NATION ALL

01:48:57.631 --> 01:48:59.766
JUST REITERATE IN TWENTY TWENTY

01:48:59.833 --> 01:49:00.500
ONE IT WAS ACTUALLY THE FIRST

01:49:00.567 --> 01:49:02.435
REPORT OF THE DESERT LET

01:49:02.502 --> 01:49:04.104
DISTRIBUTION REGION SO IMPERIAL

01:49:04.170 --> 01:49:06.039
AND RIVERSIDE COUNTIES THAT

01:49:06.106 --> 01:49:08.942
REPORTED- THIS VIRUS AS WELL AS

01:49:09.009 --> 01:49:10.510
IN YOU MIND TALKING TO ARIZONA

01:49:10.577 --> 01:49:12.746
SO THAT SUGGESTS THAT THIS VIRUS

01:49:12.812 --> 01:49:14.180
IS SPREADING TO OTHER LETTERS

01:49:14.247 --> 01:49:17.117
PRODUCING REGIONS IN TWENTY

01:49:17.183 --> 01:49:17.651
TWENTY I DON'T THINK IT'S

01:49:17.717 --> 01:49:19.686
RELATED TO THE PRODUCTION HERE-

01:49:19.753 --> 01:49:21.021
BUT THIS VIRUS WAS ALSO

01:49:21.087 --> 01:49:22.455
DESCRIBED IN LOTUS PRODUCTION

01:49:22.522 --> 01:49:25.759
INCREASED SO- AS A WHOLE THIS

01:49:25.825 --> 01:49:27.894
THIS VIRUS IS BECOMING. MORE

01:49:27.961 --> 01:49:30.230
ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT IN LEAFY

01:49:30.297 --> 01:49:31.865
GREENS NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA

01:49:31.932 --> 01:49:33.733
AND ARIZONA BUT OTHER REGIONS AS

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:36.036
WELL KILL ANYTHING THAT WE LEARN

01:49:36.102 --> 01:49:37.337
HERE FROM THE RESEARCH CAN

01:49:37.404 --> 01:49:38.672
DEFINITELY SHED LIGHT IN TERMS

01:49:38.738 --> 01:49:45.011
OF MANAGEMENT. FOR OTHER REGIONS

01:49:45.078 --> 01:49:46.212
AS WELL- I'M JUST GONNA GO

01:49:46.279 --> 01:49:47.147
THROUGH A BUNCH PICTURES- I

01:49:47.213 --> 01:49:48.114
THINK SEEN ON OF WOMEN THIS

01:49:48.181 --> 01:49:49.783
POINT SO MAYBE ALREADY.

01:49:49.849 --> 01:49:52.719
TRANSPLANT BUT THIS THE FINAL BY

01:49:52.786 --> 01:49:56.222
. SO IMPAIR IN THE- SPOT MYERS.

01:49:56.289 --> 01:49:58.158
THIS IS A LUNATIC IN THIS.

01:49:58.224 --> 01:49:58.758
PICTURE RIGHT HERE REALLY THE

01:49:58.825 --> 01:50:00.694
BROWNING ON THE LEADS STARTING

01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:02.195
OF THE GROWTH YOU CAN SEE ON THE

01:50:02.262 --> 01:50:04.531
RIGHT SIDE- MOTION THOSE PLANTS

01:50:04.597 --> 01:50:06.232
ARE INFECTED THERE'S ONE THAT

01:50:06.299 --> 01:50:07.300
LOOKS HEALTHY ON THE TOP RIGHT

01:50:07.367 --> 01:50:10.136
CORNER- MY FEELING IS IT IS

01:50:10.203 --> 01:50:12.572
PROBABLY IS INFECTED AS WELL.

01:50:12.639 --> 01:50:14.407
IT'S JUST A SYMPTOMATIC SELF

01:50:14.474 --> 01:50:16.209
ALSO BE TALKING A LITTLE BIT

01:50:16.276 --> 01:50:18.111
ABOUT SOME PARALLELS IN HOW WE-

01:50:18.178 --> 01:50:19.346
THINK ABOUT COVERAGE BECAUSE IT

01:50:19.412 --> 01:50:21.748
CERTAINLY HELPED ME. UNDERSTAND

01:50:21.815 --> 01:50:25.118
THIS VIRUS FROM- IN LETTUCES

01:50:25.185 --> 01:50:27.487
WALLS. HOW THIS IS SAME HILDA

01:50:27.554 --> 01:50:29.356
ARE NOW FIELD TWENTY TWENTY YOU

01:50:29.422 --> 01:50:30.290
CAN SEE THAT THEY'RE SWEET

01:50:30.357 --> 01:50:32.392
ALYSSUM WHICH IS A- A BENEFICIAL

01:50:32.459 --> 01:50:34.494
PLANT- THAT'S PLANTED IN THERE

01:50:34.561 --> 01:50:36.262
AND THAT'S REALLY TO ATTRACT.

01:50:36.329 --> 01:50:38.198
BENEFICIAL INSECTS PREDATORY

01:50:38.264 --> 01:50:39.699
INSECTS TO TRY TO MANAGE THE

01:50:39.766 --> 01:50:42.068
ROPES NATURALLY- YOU CAN SEE

01:50:42.135 --> 01:50:44.137
THERE'S- A WIDESPREAD AMOUNT OF

01:50:44.204 --> 01:50:45.638
VIRUS INCIDENTS THROUGHOUT THIS

01:50:45.705 --> 01:50:48.208
FIELD- THIS FIELD WAS A 100%

01:50:48.274 --> 01:50:51.244
CROP LOSS BY THE TIME- IF CAME

01:50:51.311 --> 01:50:53.880
TO HARVEST. SO NEXT FIVE. TWENTY

01:50:53.947 --> 01:50:55.915
TWENTY ONE- WHICH ALL OF THE

01:50:55.982 --> 01:50:58.151
SAME THING IN CERTAIN AREAS-

01:50:58.218 --> 01:50:59.519
SOME OF THOSE PLANS FOR A BIGGER

01:50:59.586 --> 01:51:00.920
ALL THE OTHER ONES THAT ARE

01:51:00.987 --> 01:51:03.456
STUNTED AND SMALLER- THOSE ARE

01:51:03.523 --> 01:51:09.229
INFECTED WITH IMPATIENS NECROTIC. SPOT FIRES. NEXT AND INTO THE

01:51:09.295 --> 01:51:11.364
NINE WE REALLY WANT SOME-

01:51:11.431 --> 01:51:12.866
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES TO

01:51:12.932 --> 01:51:14.434
UNDERSTAND THE MOVEMENT OF THIS

01:51:14.501 --> 01:51:16.169
VIRUS AND- ONE OF THE THINGS

01:51:16.236 --> 01:51:19.072
THAT WAS QUITE SURPRISING IS-

01:51:19.139 --> 01:51:20.740
HOW EARLY THIS VIRUS CAN BE

01:51:20.807 --> 01:51:22.475
INTRODUCED WITHIN A FIELD AND SO

01:51:22.542 --> 01:51:24.277
THIS IS A PRETENDING FEEL-

01:51:24.344 --> 01:51:27.881
STAGE. OF A LETTUCE CROP AND-

01:51:27.947 --> 01:51:30.183
THAT'S PROBABLY OUT ABOUT THREE

01:51:30.250 --> 01:51:31.151
THREE TO FOUR WEEKS OF GROWTH

01:51:31.217 --> 01:51:32.318
AND YOU'RE ALREADY SEEING VERY

01:51:32.385 --> 01:51:34.621
STRONG SYMPTOMS. OF THIS VIRUS

01:51:34.687 --> 01:51:37.557
SHOW UP ON A NEXT SLIDE. THAT

01:51:37.624 --> 01:51:39.259
SAME FIELD WE JUST MONITOR THE

01:51:39.325 --> 01:51:40.994
SPREAD OF THIS VIRUS THROUGHOUT

01:51:41.061 --> 01:51:43.163
THE ENTIRE FIELD. ON THE ENTIRE

01:51:43.229 --> 01:51:45.365
CROP CYCLE WAS ABOUT NINE WEEKS

01:51:45.432 --> 01:51:47.934
THAT'S ABOUT AS FAST AS- YOU'LL

01:51:48.001 --> 01:51:50.503
GO FROM PLANTING TO HARVEST- IN

01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:51.871
THE SALINAS VALLEY IN KNOX

01:51:51.938 --> 01:51:54.074
AROUND YOU KNOW SUMMER. LATE

01:51:54.140 --> 01:51:57.544
SUMMER- AND THIS WAS A 100% CROP

01:51:57.610 --> 01:51:59.612
LOSSES WELL ONE OF THE THINGS I

01:51:59.679 --> 01:52:01.314
WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT.

01:52:01.381 --> 01:52:03.183
INTENSITY OF LETTUCE PRODUCTION

01:52:03.249 --> 01:52:06.286
IN THIS REGION IS- IS QUITE

01:52:06.352 --> 01:52:08.221
QUITE INTENSE AND SO IT'S NOT. A

01:52:08.288 --> 01:52:10.190
MONO CROP THAT IS PLANTED AS

01:52:10.256 --> 01:52:12.125
THERE'S A LOT OF LOCATIONS THAT

01:52:12.192 --> 01:52:14.360
ARE HEAVILY RELIED ON. AND ON A

01:52:14.427 --> 01:52:16.296
PER ACRE BASIS YOU CAN GET

01:52:16.362 --> 01:52:17.864
MULTIPLE PLANTINGS OF WHAT IS

01:52:17.931 --> 01:52:19.799
WITHIN THE SEASON ITSELF. JUST

01:52:19.866 --> 01:52:22.068
BECAUSE ONE ONE SECTION IS QUICK

01:52:22.135 --> 01:52:24.137
OUT OF THE CLEAR EARLIER ON IN

01:52:24.204 --> 01:52:25.605
THE SEASON DOESN'T MEAN THAT

01:52:25.672 --> 01:52:27.073
YOUR NEXT PAINTING WILL BE AND

01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:28.541
SO THAT'S WHAT WE SAW HERE. IS

01:52:28.608 --> 01:52:29.576
REALLY THE MOVEMENT OF THE

01:52:29.642 --> 01:52:30.944
BUYERS THROUGHOUT THIS ONE

01:52:31.010 --> 01:52:33.613
FIELD. BUT IT ALSO IMPACTED CHIU

01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:34.380
NEIGHBORHOOD FIELDS THAT WERE

01:52:34.447 --> 01:52:41.488
PLANTED RIGHT AFTER THIS.

01:52:41.554 --> 01:52:42.822
EXCELLENT I AND THEN THIS IS

01:52:42.889 --> 01:52:45.091
REAL OUR ARCHITECT SO MISTER.

01:52:45.158 --> 01:52:46.326
NOT BY YOU CAN TOUCH THE VICE

01:52:46.392 --> 01:52:47.760
YOU CAN TRANSMIT THAT IT'S NOT

01:52:47.827 --> 01:52:48.928
ME CAN'T TRYING. THAT'S ACTUAL

01:52:48.995 --> 01:52:50.530
FRASER IT. IS ACTUALLY

01:52:50.597 --> 01:52:52.599
TRANSMITTED BY THE IMPACT WHICH

01:52:52.665 --> 01:52:54.300
IS THE WATSON PARKER'S. WHICH AS

01:52:54.367 --> 01:52:55.301
YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR

01:52:55.368 --> 01:52:57.036
INTRODUCTION INTO VERY SMALL

01:52:57.103 --> 01:52:58.505
INSECTS SO ONE U. TWO

01:52:58.571 --> 01:53:00.406
MILLIMETERS- YEAH AND THAT'S A

01:53:00.473 --> 01:53:02.876
VERY EARLY. A LETTUCE PLANT ON

01:53:02.942 --> 01:53:04.377
THE RIGHT HAND SIDE AND I'VE

01:53:04.444 --> 01:53:06.146
JUST HIGHLIGHTED HOW SMALL THESE

01:53:06.212 --> 01:53:08.715
INSECTS ARE- IN ADDITION THEY

01:53:08.781 --> 01:53:10.583
LEAVE A LOT OF FEEDING DAMAGE OF

01:53:10.650 --> 01:53:12.152
THOSE ARE THAT'S DAMAGE SUCH

01:53:12.218 --> 01:53:13.720
CALLS FROM FEEDING BY THE

01:53:13.786 --> 01:53:15.822
INFECTED CELL. AND BRINGS UP THE

01:53:15.889 --> 01:53:17.457
POINT THAT IN ADDITION TO JUST

01:53:17.524 --> 01:53:19.425
ECONOMIC IMPACT THAT THE VIRUS

01:53:19.492 --> 01:53:23.396
HOUSE- THERE'S ALSO- BEATING ALL

01:53:23.463 --> 01:53:24.931
LOSSES JUST THEIR DAMAGE

01:53:24.998 --> 01:53:26.432
COSMETIC DAMAGE THAT'S-

01:53:26.499 --> 01:53:28.368
INFLICTED BY THIS IMPACT IN A

01:53:28.434 --> 01:53:30.170
LOT OF THIS CHANGES. NOT ONLY

01:53:30.236 --> 01:53:32.639
WITHIN THE U. S. BUT IT ALSO HAS

01:53:32.705 --> 01:53:35.008
DEPENDED ON STANDARDS SET BY THE

01:53:35.074 --> 01:53:36.776
EXPORT MARKET WHICH IS STRONGLY

01:53:36.843 --> 01:53:38.845
LIMITED. MATERIALS THAT ARE

01:53:38.912 --> 01:53:42.282
GROWERS AND PCAS CAN USE- AND

01:53:42.348 --> 01:53:44.651
THAT ULTIMATELY AFFECTS REALLY-

01:53:44.717 --> 01:53:46.920
THE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. THAT

01:53:46.986 --> 01:53:48.321
ARE INDUCED INDUSTRY CAN

01:53:48.388 --> 01:53:50.123
IMPLEMENT FIVE HOURS AGAIN

01:53:50.190 --> 01:53:51.090
DISMISSED TRACTORS JUST

01:53:51.157 --> 01:53:52.492
HIGHLIGHTING. REALLY THE

01:53:52.559 --> 01:53:59.065
INFESTATION THAT. CAN OCCUR AT A

01:53:59.132 --> 01:54:00.233
VERY EARLY STAGE- VERY BRIEFLY

01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:01.267
I'M GONNA SPEND TOO MUCH ON HERE

01:54:01.334 --> 01:54:02.869
THE POINT IS BOB DOLE CHIU SMALL

01:54:02.936 --> 01:54:04.571
THE FOURTEENTH CAN LIE. HUNDRED

01:54:04.637 --> 01:54:05.505
OF DAYS THROUGHOUT HER LIFE

01:54:05.572 --> 01:54:07.574
CYCLE AND THEY HAVE A WIDE RANGE

01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:09.142
OF DEVELOPMENT TEMPERATURES SO

01:54:09.209 --> 01:54:11.144
BETWEEN FORTY FIVE AND A HUNDRED

01:54:11.211 --> 01:54:13.646
AND FOUR DEGREES- THIS INSECT

01:54:13.713 --> 01:54:15.148
WILL CONTINUE DEVELOPING

01:54:15.215 --> 01:54:18.218
CONTINUOUS LIFECYCLE- ONE OF THE

01:54:18.284 --> 01:54:19.385
CHALLENGES FOR THE WESTERN

01:54:19.452 --> 01:54:21.087
FLOWER THRIPS IS GOT. A LOT OF

01:54:21.154 --> 01:54:23.122
FLOWERS AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE-

01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.957
THEY'RE CALLED THE WESTERN

01:54:24.023 --> 01:54:25.992
FLOWER THRIPS. SO ANYTHING THAT

01:54:26.059 --> 01:54:28.228
FLOWERS A LOT NOT FALL INTO THE

01:54:28.294 --> 01:54:30.396
HOST RANGE THE NUMBER OF PLANTS

01:54:30.463 --> 01:54:32.398
THAT CAN SUPPORT THE WESTERN

01:54:32.465 --> 01:54:36.603
PARTNERS IS IN THE HUNDREDS- IN

01:54:36.669 --> 01:54:39.272
TERMS OF HOW OF IRISES SO MERRY

01:54:39.339 --> 01:54:40.907
- THE COUSIN OF MINE IS TO. AS

01:54:40.974 --> 01:54:43.176
TOMATOES WILT VIRUS AND THAT'S

01:54:43.243 --> 01:54:45.278
ANOTHER VIRUS- THAT HAVEN'T

01:54:45.345 --> 01:54:47.146
QUITE REACHED ECONOMIC LEVELS IN

01:54:47.213 --> 01:54:49.449
LETTERS BUT- AFTER FAMILIAR WITH

01:54:49.515 --> 01:54:50.783
TOMATO PRODUCTION IN CENTRAL

01:54:50.850 --> 01:54:52.885
VALLEY IT'S BECOME A PROBLEM IN

01:54:52.952 --> 01:54:54.921
THAT REGION. ON THE SAME THING

01:54:54.988 --> 01:54:56.389
JUST LIKE FOR US WE KNOW THAT

01:54:56.456 --> 01:54:58.091
THE HOST RANGE FOR I. S. B.

01:54:58.157 --> 01:54:59.959
SHOWS. THE NUMBER OF PLANTS THAT

01:55:00.026 --> 01:55:02.195
CAN BE INFECTED BY THE VIRUS IS

01:55:02.262 --> 01:55:04.264
ALSO IN THE HUNDREDS. AND SO IF

01:55:04.330 --> 01:55:05.298
YOU JUST THINK ABOUT A

01:55:05.365 --> 01:55:06.799
MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE ON

01:55:06.866 --> 01:55:09.936
REDUCING. HABITAT STILL LIMITED.

01:55:10.003 --> 01:55:12.105
VOTES THAT CAN SUPPORT EITHER

01:55:12.171 --> 01:55:14.607
INTACT FOR THE VIRUS BECOMES

01:55:14.674 --> 01:55:18.745
EXTREMELY. OVERWHELMING AND

01:55:18.811 --> 01:55:20.546
SHALL- AND THEN THIS IS JUST

01:55:20.613 --> 01:55:21.648
KIND OF FOLLOW UP TO ORDINARY

01:55:21.714 --> 01:55:24.317
SAID ABOUT. OF IDEA TEMPERATURES

01:55:24.384 --> 01:55:26.019
IN THIRDS POPULATIONS AND SO I

01:55:26.085 --> 01:55:28.454
JUST PUT THEIR GENERALLY THAT

01:55:28.521 --> 01:55:29.455
THE LETTER SEASON IN OUR REGION

01:55:29.522 --> 01:55:31.658
RUNS. ALL THE CRIME REALLY

01:55:31.724 --> 01:55:33.259
MONTHS ARE FROM MARCH TO

01:55:33.326 --> 01:55:34.527
NOVEMBER AND THEN IT SWITCHES

01:55:34.594 --> 01:55:36.429
DOWN TO IMPERIAL AND RIVERSIDE.

01:55:36.496 --> 01:55:37.897
DURING THE WINTER TIME AND SO

01:55:37.964 --> 01:55:39.532
THERE'S QUITE THIS INTEGRATION

01:55:39.599 --> 01:55:40.633
BETWEEN THE TWO PRODUCING

01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:43.136
REGIONS BUT- WE DID HAVE A

01:55:43.202 --> 01:55:44.404
COOLER CLIMATE WITH COOLER

01:55:44.470 --> 01:55:45.538
TEMPERATURES THIS PAST YEAR AND

01:55:45.605 --> 01:55:47.640
THAT'S WHAT YOU CAN SEE- FROM

01:55:47.707 --> 01:55:49.442
THAT BLACK ONE IN TWENTY TWENTY

01:55:49.509 --> 01:55:51.444
ONE- AND REALLY IT'S THE WEATHER

01:55:51.511 --> 01:55:53.680
THAT **** DISORIENTATING FASTER

01:55:53.746 --> 01:55:55.682
DEVELOPMENT AS I MENTIONED IN A

01:55:55.748 --> 01:55:58.151
FEW SLIDES AGO. CELL HIGH

01:55:58.217 --> 01:56:00.453
POPULATIONS GENERALLY INCREASE

01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:05.525
IN PROGRESS THROUGH. THE WARMER

01:56:05.591 --> 01:56:06.426
MONTHS NEXT FIVE. I AM NOT SURE

01:56:06.492 --> 01:56:07.994
CORE. FOR HOW WE- DEVELOPMENT

01:56:08.061 --> 01:56:11.597
STAR. OF THE- AS WELL NEXT FIVE.

01:56:11.664 --> 01:56:13.266
AND THEN FROM THE TWO THOUSAND

01:56:13.333 --> 01:56:14.133
NINETEEN SLUGS STUDY ON THE

01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:15.902
SHOWING THAT THAT PLANTING SLOT

01:56:15.968 --> 01:56:18.104
WAS BETWEEN JUNE AND SEPTEMBER-

01:56:18.171 --> 01:56:19.605
AND AS I MENTIONED YOU CAN GET

01:56:19.672 --> 01:56:21.541
MORE THAN ONE PLANTING ON A PER

01:56:21.607 --> 01:56:23.976
ACRE BASIS AND SO. ONE THERE ARE

01:56:24.043 --> 01:56:25.845
STILL MONTHS OUT MUNSTER GO IN

01:56:25.912 --> 01:56:27.413
THAT SEASON AND SO ALL THE

01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:29.482
FIELDS. AROUND THAT SUFFERED

01:56:29.549 --> 01:56:32.919
JUSTICE HARBINGERS OF THE VIRUS-

01:56:32.985 --> 01:56:34.487
ANYWAYS JUST TRYING TO PROVIDE

01:56:34.554 --> 01:56:35.988
SOME PERSPECTIVE ON ON THE

01:56:36.055 --> 01:56:37.490
EPIDEMIOLOGY AND SOME OF THE

01:56:37.557 --> 01:56:38.925
WORK THAT WE'VE ALREADY TRIED TO

01:56:38.991 --> 01:56:41.894
DO TO UNDERSTAND THIS VIRUS AND

01:56:41.961 --> 01:56:44.897
THE FACT- TEMPERATURES. OVER THE

01:56:44.964 --> 01:56:46.566
PAST TWENTY YEARS ON THIS REPORT

01:56:46.632 --> 01:56:48.868
FROM ONE OF THE LOCATIONS- IN

01:56:48.935 --> 01:56:51.671
SALINAS AND SO ON AVERAGE. OF

01:56:51.738 --> 01:56:53.139
THE HIGH AIR OF THE HIGH

01:56:53.206 --> 01:56:55.041
TEMPERATURE AND LOW TEMPERATURES

01:56:55.108 --> 01:56:56.809
HAVE INCREASED OVER THE PAST

01:56:56.876 --> 01:56:58.478
TWENTY YEARS. AND JUST REFERRING

01:56:58.544 --> 01:56:59.779
BACK TO THE DEVELOPMENTAL

01:56:59.846 --> 01:57:01.748
THRESHOLDS FOR THRIPS DOCTRINE

01:57:01.814 --> 01:57:04.083
THAT RED LINE AS- YOU CAN SEE

01:57:04.150 --> 01:57:05.051
THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO OVER THE

01:57:05.118 --> 01:57:09.155
PAST. TWENTY YEARS- DOCTOR HOLD-

01:57:09.222 --> 01:57:11.357
IS NOT REAL IS THE TEMPERATURES

01:57:11.424 --> 01:57:13.059
ARE NOT BELOW THAT THRESHOLD AND

01:57:13.126 --> 01:57:14.260
THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE

01:57:14.327 --> 01:57:17.029
NEVER ACTUALLY GET. A BREAK IN

01:57:17.096 --> 01:57:18.865
THE REPRODUCTION OF THIS INSECT.

01:57:18.931 --> 01:57:20.366
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR WORSE

01:57:20.433 --> 01:57:22.301
HISTORICALLY MAYBE POPULATIONS

01:57:22.368 --> 01:57:23.302
WERE SUPPRESSED IN THE

01:57:23.369 --> 01:57:25.304
WINTERTIME. WORSE NOW WILL WE

01:57:25.371 --> 01:57:27.473
CONTINUE TO SEE ACTIVITY EVEN

01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:30.877
WHEN NOT THIS IS NOT PRESENT IN

01:57:30.943 --> 01:57:34.046
THE BALLOT- MANAGE CHALLENGES I

01:57:34.113 --> 01:57:35.782
BROKE IT DOWN INTO THREE PIECES

01:57:35.848 --> 01:57:37.150
AND I THINK I WANTED TO DO IT

01:57:37.216 --> 01:57:38.251
THIS WAY BECAUSE I THINK IT

01:57:38.317 --> 01:57:40.119
HIGHLIGHTS THE COMPLEXITY BEHIND

01:57:40.186 --> 01:57:41.988
US. BUT WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:57:42.054 --> 01:57:43.990
DIRECTION MANAGEMENT OF THREATS

01:57:44.056 --> 01:57:45.725
ALL THESE POINTS ARE NOT- ARE

01:57:45.792 --> 01:57:47.727
FAMILIAR TO YOU ALREADY BECAUSE

01:57:47.794 --> 01:57:48.327
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE

01:57:48.394 --> 01:57:50.196
TALKED ABOUT- BUT- HIGHLY

01:57:50.263 --> 01:57:52.165
REPRODUCTIVE SMALL INSECTS. THIS

01:57:52.231 --> 01:57:54.200
IDEA NGUYEN TRAVEL WE'VE DONE

01:57:54.267 --> 01:57:55.401
SOME STUDIES WERE REDUCING

01:57:55.468 --> 01:57:57.603
TARIFFS TWENTY FIVE FEET HIGH IN

01:57:57.670 --> 01:57:59.672
THE WIN COLUMN SO IF YOU THINK

01:57:59.739 --> 01:58:01.007
ABOUT TRYING TO PT IT VERY

01:58:01.073 --> 01:58:03.576
ORDER SUPPRESSING POPULATION.

01:58:03.643 --> 01:58:05.244
I'M COMING INTO A FIELD THAT

01:58:05.311 --> 01:58:07.180
BECOMES INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT IF

01:58:07.246 --> 01:58:08.514
THEY'RE MOVING THAT HIGH UP IN

01:58:08.581 --> 01:58:10.349
THE WIN COLUMN. AS MARK

01:58:10.416 --> 01:58:12.318
MENTIONED VERY LIMITED CHEMICAL

01:58:12.385 --> 01:58:15.021
OPTIONS- AND ALL OF THIS AFFECTS

01:58:15.087 --> 01:58:16.556
NOT ONLY WHAT'S AVAILABLE BUT

01:58:16.622 --> 01:58:18.291
ALSO THIS IDEA OF RESISTANCE

01:58:18.357 --> 01:58:20.026
MANAGEMENT. AND THEN THE LARGE

01:58:20.092 --> 01:58:22.028
HOST RANGE WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:58:22.094 --> 01:58:25.765
VIRUS NEXT SLIDE- THERE ARE NO

01:58:25.832 --> 01:58:27.266
DIRECT METHOD FOR PREVENTING OR

01:58:27.333 --> 01:58:28.601
TREATING THE VIRUS SO IF WE

01:58:28.668 --> 01:58:31.137
THINK ABOUT PROVISIONS. BAXEEN

01:58:31.204 --> 01:58:32.805
SOCIAL DISTANCING MASKING YOU

01:58:32.872 --> 01:58:34.574
CAN'T DO THAT FOR PLANTS RIGHT

01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:36.476
AND SO. HOW DO WE MANAGE THE

01:58:36.542 --> 01:58:38.811
VIRUS- AND CREATING NEW

01:58:38.878 --> 01:58:41.314
TECHNOLOGIES TO DO THIS- WE WERE

01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:42.748
ALSO NOT AT THE POINT WHERE YOU

01:58:42.815 --> 01:58:44.383
SEE A LOT OF GENETIC RESISTANCE

01:58:44.450 --> 01:58:46.586
IN BY THIS VARIETIES AND SELF

01:58:46.652 --> 01:58:48.254
JENNIFER MENTIONED IN HER SLIDE.

01:58:48.321 --> 01:58:49.489
ON A LOT OF THE EFFORTS ARE

01:58:49.555 --> 01:58:51.090
GOING INTO BREEDING WHICH IS

01:58:51.157 --> 01:58:52.625
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE I

01:58:52.692 --> 01:58:54.393
THINK THAT IS A LONG TERM.

01:58:54.460 --> 01:58:56.429
STRATEGY FOR MANAGING THE VIRUS

01:58:56.496 --> 01:58:58.498
BY GENERATING GENETIC RESISTANCE

01:58:58.564 --> 01:59:00.299
BUT THAT'S JUST NOT AVAILABLE

01:59:00.366 --> 01:59:01.901
WIDELY TO THE INDUSTRY AT THIS

01:59:01.968 --> 01:59:04.270
POINT- AND AGAIN THE LAST PART

01:59:04.337 --> 01:59:06.906
IS DOES THE HOST RANGE- IDEA FOR

01:59:06.973 --> 01:59:09.342
THIS VIRUS SO. NEXT SLIDE AND

01:59:09.408 --> 01:59:11.410
THEN. FINALLY THINKING ABOUT

01:59:11.477 --> 01:59:13.412
THIS PROBLEM AS A WHOLE SO WHEN

01:59:13.479 --> 01:59:15.014
YOU BRING TRIPS AND I NEED TO BE

01:59:15.081 --> 01:59:16.382
TOGETHER I WANTED TO POINT OUT

01:59:16.449 --> 01:59:18.818
THAT TRANSMISSION OCCURS WITHIN

01:59:18.885 --> 01:59:20.453
MINUTES OF FEEDING ALLOWED US.

01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:22.088
CONSERVE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:59:22.154 --> 01:59:23.523
THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE INHERENT

01:59:23.589 --> 01:59:25.391
DESPERATE THIS IDEA OF MOVEMENT

01:59:25.458 --> 01:59:26.893
IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE LIMITED

01:59:26.959 --> 01:59:33.733
CHEMICAL OPTIONS PRIMARILY.

01:59:33.799 --> 01:59:34.200
THOSE THAT ARE CONTACT

01:59:34.267 --> 01:59:36.135
COMMISSION DREES. IF YOU YES ALL

01:59:36.202 --> 01:59:37.670
YOU HAVE ARE CHEMISTRY AND CAN

01:59:37.737 --> 01:59:38.704
TAKE SOME MINUTES HOW DO YOU GET

01:59:38.771 --> 01:59:39.772
OF THIS THING AND IT'S VERY

01:59:39.839 --> 01:59:42.375
DIFFERENT TO DO THAT SO NEXT

01:59:42.441 --> 01:59:44.510
LINE AND ON TOP OF THAT- JUST TO

01:59:44.577 --> 01:59:46.512
CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATH HERE OF

01:59:46.579 --> 01:59:48.581
COMPLEXITY IS THIS IDEA OF

01:59:48.648 --> 01:59:49.882
CALLING FACTIONS WITH AT THE END%

01:59:49.949 --> 01:59:53.386
WILL NOT. SLIDE SAME THING

01:59:53.452 --> 01:59:54.787
YOU'RE SAYING YOU SEEN THE

01:59:54.854 --> 01:59:56.923
SLIDE- OR EXAMPLES OF THIS

01:59:56.989 --> 01:59:58.758
BUDGET CAN I AND RICHARD WE

01:59:58.824 --> 02:00:00.593
TESTED. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY

02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:02.094
PLANS MAYBE TEN PLANTS OUT OF

02:00:02.161 --> 02:00:04.096
THIS FIELD RANDOMLY PICKED. FROM

02:00:04.163 --> 02:00:05.565
THIS CORNER AND EACH ONE OF THEM

02:00:05.631 --> 02:00:07.400
HAD BOTH MINUS THE ENTIRE TEAM

02:00:07.466 --> 02:00:09.235
WILL. AND I THINK WHAT'S

02:00:09.302 --> 02:00:10.202
IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT HERE IS

02:00:10.269 --> 02:00:12.138
THAT. WE REALLY NEED TO

02:00:12.204 --> 02:00:13.172
UNDERSTAND THE INTERACTION

02:00:13.239 --> 02:00:15.007
BETWEEN THESE TWO PATHOGENS AND

02:00:15.074 --> 02:00:16.409
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

02:00:16.475 --> 02:00:18.477
IF WE CAN UNDERSTAND. IF ONE

02:00:18.544 --> 02:00:20.079
PATHOGEN IS MAKING THE PLANT

02:00:20.146 --> 02:00:22.448
MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO INFECTION BY

02:00:22.515 --> 02:00:24.584
THE OTHER THAN THAT MIGHT GUIDE

02:00:24.650 --> 02:00:26.152
US IN TERMS OF MANAGING ONE

02:00:26.218 --> 02:00:27.353
PASSED THE CHEN VERSUS THE

02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:31.223
OTHER- AS AN ENTIRE SYSTEM SO

02:00:31.290 --> 02:00:33.693
NEXT SLIDE- AND THEN FINALLY I

02:00:33.759 --> 02:00:35.294
AM FIVE. STRIPPED EVERYTHING

02:00:35.361 --> 02:00:36.996
AWAY AND JUST LAST RESEARCH

02:00:37.063 --> 02:00:38.631
PROGRESS AND OPPORTUNITIES AND

02:00:38.698 --> 02:00:40.533
WHAT WE'RE DOING. AND WHERE SOME

02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:42.268
OF THE S. B. ONE SEVENTY FUNDS

02:00:42.335 --> 02:00:44.337
ARE GONNA BE USED TO ADDRESS.

02:00:44.403 --> 02:00:46.138
NOT ONLY THE INDIVIDUAL

02:00:46.205 --> 02:00:47.807
COMPONENTS BUT THE ENTIRE THING

02:00:47.873 --> 02:00:50.610
IS A HOLD ON THE NEXT SLIDE. SO

02:00:50.676 --> 02:00:52.211
FOR THRIPS- THIS IS SOME WORK

02:00:52.278 --> 02:00:53.346
THAT WE'RE ALREADY DOING A LOT

02:00:53.412 --> 02:00:54.614
OF IT IS SUPPORTED BY THE

02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:57.016
CALIFORNIA LEAFY GREENS. PROGRAM

02:00:57.083 --> 02:00:58.351
AND WE'VE BEEN REALLY GRATEFUL

02:00:58.417 --> 02:01:00.019
TO HAVE VERY GOOD SUPPORT FROM

02:01:00.086 --> 02:01:01.787
THEM SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN

02:01:01.854 --> 02:01:03.089
WHEN I STARTED SO. WE'RE

02:01:03.155 --> 02:01:04.991
UTILIZING PREDATORY INSECTS TO

02:01:05.057 --> 02:01:07.093
COMBAT BURKE CHAU RELEASING WHAT

02:01:07.159 --> 02:01:08.628
WE CALLED BENEFICIAL INSECTS

02:01:08.694 --> 02:01:09.895
WERE WORKING WITH THE COMPANY

02:01:09.962 --> 02:01:11.831
DOING DRUM RELEASES AND- SOME

02:01:11.897 --> 02:01:13.566
ORGANIC PRODUCTION. OUR

02:01:13.633 --> 02:01:15.267
MONITORING POPULATIONS WERE

02:01:15.334 --> 02:01:16.702
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND MOVEMENTS

02:01:16.769 --> 02:01:19.372
AND BEHAVIOR- WE'RE TRYING TO

02:01:19.438 --> 02:01:20.840
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME-

02:01:20.906 --> 02:01:22.508
HAZARDS THAT ARE BEING USED AND

02:01:22.575 --> 02:01:25.077
IF WE CAN MAXIMIZE THAT- USING

02:01:25.144 --> 02:01:26.512
SOME OF THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES

02:01:26.579 --> 02:01:27.713
AS YOU SEE THERE ON THE RIGHT

02:01:27.780 --> 02:01:30.549
PROCEDURE INSPIRATION- MARC

02:01:30.616 --> 02:01:31.984
MIGHT BE ABLE TO TALK A LITTLE

02:01:32.051 --> 02:01:32.918
BIT MORE ABOUT IF YOU'RE

02:01:32.985 --> 02:01:34.153
INTERESTED BUT THE ESTIMATE IS

02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:35.721
THAT YOU COULD REDUCE IT DOWN TO

02:01:35.788 --> 02:01:37.390
ONE TENTH OF ALL IN. AT THE

02:01:37.456 --> 02:01:39.592
EARLIEST APPLICATION PHASE WHICH

02:01:39.659 --> 02:01:41.694
I THINK IS JUST SUPER EXCITING.

02:01:41.761 --> 02:01:43.663
WE TALK ABOUT I. S. B. NEXT

02:01:43.729 --> 02:01:46.165
SLIDE- WEED ABATEMENTS ON MARION

02:01:46.232 --> 02:01:48.401
RICHARD IF TALK BOTH AOUT THIS.

02:01:48.467 --> 02:01:50.069
QUITE EXTENSIVELY BUT A LOT OF

02:01:50.136 --> 02:01:57.176
THE RESEARCH. THAT WE'VE BEEN

02:01:57.243 --> 02:01:57.810
ABLE TO CONDUCT HAS GUIDED A LOT

02:01:57.877 --> 02:02:00.446
OF THE STATE AND PRO- TO NAY.

02:02:00.513 --> 02:02:01.814
SOME OF THE- FOR THE FIRE- AND

02:02:01.881 --> 02:02:04.884
THEN. TO PLAY IMMUNE HIGH FIRES

02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:06.218
AND SO THE J. POINT BUILD A

02:02:06.285 --> 02:02:09.088
HEALTHY PLAN. A STRONG GROUP-

02:02:09.155 --> 02:02:09.989
CAN POTENTIAL HELP FIGHT OFF

02:02:10.056 --> 02:02:13.359
SOME OF THOSE- SLIDE- WE'RE

02:02:13.426 --> 02:02:14.393
THINKING ABOUT IMPROVING.

02:02:14.460 --> 02:02:16.796
PROGRAMS TO MONITOR. DOCTORING

02:02:16.862 --> 02:02:18.497
SO IDENTIFYING POPULATIONS THAT

02:02:18.564 --> 02:02:20.499
ACTUALLY HAVE THE PLAYERS. AND

02:02:20.566 --> 02:02:22.835
THEN- REALLY LOOKING AT THE

02:02:22.902 --> 02:02:24.236
INTERACTIONS AS I ALLUDED TO IN

02:02:24.303 --> 02:02:27.940
THE PREVIOUS. LIFE AND THEN THE

02:02:28.007 --> 02:02:29.408
LAST THING- IS REALLY NOVEL AND

02:02:29.475 --> 02:02:31.310
EMERGING BIOTECHNOLOGIES WRITTEN

02:02:31.377 --> 02:02:33.546
SECOND HE'S MANAGEMENT SO AREN'T

02:02:33.612 --> 02:02:34.714
ANY INTERFERENCE WAS ONE OF THE

02:02:34.780 --> 02:02:36.115
PROJECTS THAT YOU SAW IN

02:02:36.182 --> 02:02:37.983
JENNIFER'S PRESENTATION THERE'S

02:02:38.050 --> 02:02:38.818
A NUMBER OF OTHER PROJECTS THAT

02:02:38.884 --> 02:02:41.153
I'M WORKING ON. WITH USDA TO TRY

02:02:41.220 --> 02:02:43.656
TO BUILD ON THESE NEW TOOLS FOR

02:02:43.723 --> 02:02:45.991
US TWO YEARS AS WE CONTINUE TO.

02:02:46.058 --> 02:02:47.526
MOVE FORWARD AND GO THROUGH

02:02:47.593 --> 02:02:50.996
DIFFERENT REGULATORY PROCESSES-

02:02:51.063 --> 02:02:52.698
TO ACCEPT A LOT OF THESE-

02:02:52.765 --> 02:02:54.600
STRATEGIES AS WELL AS INTEGRATE

02:02:54.667 --> 02:02:57.069
THEM INTO MODELS SO. NEXT FIVE

02:02:57.136 --> 02:02:58.404
AND THEN WHAT I'VE DONE HERE IS

02:02:58.471 --> 02:03:00.840
JUST HIGHLIGHTED. A FEW OF THESE

02:03:00.906 --> 02:03:02.641
IN READ THAT STAND OUT IN MY

02:03:02.708 --> 02:03:04.910
MIND FOR HOW- THIS FUNDING WILL

02:03:04.977 --> 02:03:06.512
BE USED AND I THINK THESE ARE

02:03:06.579 --> 02:03:08.514
ADDRESSING. THERE ARE SO MANY

02:03:08.581 --> 02:03:09.348
QUESTIONS THAT ARE BEING

02:03:09.415 --> 02:03:12.218
ADDRESSED HERE- BUT BUT THE

02:03:12.284 --> 02:03:13.753
BIGGER QUESTION ABOUT HOW THIS

02:03:13.819 --> 02:03:15.321
FUNDING MIGHT BE USED THIS IS

02:03:15.387 --> 02:03:17.890
HOW I'M SORT OF ENVISIONING IT.

02:03:17.957 --> 02:03:19.091
CERTAINLY THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER

02:03:19.158 --> 02:03:20.392
PROJECTS THAT WE CAN PURSUE AS

02:03:20.459 --> 02:03:24.263
WELL. SO NEXT SLIDE. THIS IS

02:03:24.330 --> 02:03:25.765
JUST KIND OF A PER. SLIDES WHEN

02:03:25.831 --> 02:03:27.266
WE TALK ABOUT INTEGRATED PEST

02:03:27.333 --> 02:03:29.401
MANAGEMENT SO I MENTIONED

02:03:29.468 --> 02:03:31.604
COMMUTERS FATHER WILL VIRUS INTO

02:03:31.670 --> 02:03:32.972
METAL PROCESSING IN THE CENTRAL

02:03:33.038 --> 02:03:34.940
VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE

02:03:35.007 --> 02:03:36.242
IPM STRATEGY THAT THEY'VE

02:03:36.308 --> 02:03:38.978
DEVELOPED- TO REALLY GET THIS

02:03:39.044 --> 02:03:41.347
OUT TO THE INDUSTRY AND THEY HAD

02:03:41.413 --> 02:03:43.949
AN EXCELLENT RESEARCH TEAM- TO

02:03:44.016 --> 02:03:45.050
PLANT PATHOLOGIST CHU

02:03:45.117 --> 02:03:47.219
ENTOMOLOGIST AND FIVE EXTENSION

02:03:47.286 --> 02:03:50.289
PERSONNEL. WORKING ON THIS- WHEN

02:03:50.356 --> 02:03:51.724
THE DISEASE REALLY STARTED

02:03:51.791 --> 02:03:53.592
SHOWING UP IN TWO THOUSAND SIX.

02:03:53.659 --> 02:03:56.028
RESEARCH BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND

02:03:56.095 --> 02:03:57.163
SEVEN THIS PAPER WAS PUBLISHED

02:03:57.229 --> 02:03:59.465
IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND WHAT I'M

02:03:59.532 --> 02:04:01.500
REALLY JUST TRYING TO GET OUT AS

02:04:01.567 --> 02:04:03.035
YOU KNOW RESEARCH CAN BE A LONG

02:04:03.102 --> 02:04:04.837
TERM THING. YOU KNOW BUT WE HAVE

02:04:04.904 --> 02:04:06.505
TO STRATEGIZE WHAT IS A SHORT

02:04:06.572 --> 02:04:08.607
TERM GOAL AND A LONG TERM GOAL-

02:04:08.674 --> 02:04:10.643
AND IN THIS EXAMPLE IT WAS

02:04:10.709 --> 02:04:12.611
QUITE- QUITE A LONG TIME BEFORE

02:04:12.678 --> 02:04:14.647
THEY WERE ABLE TO REALLY. BUILD

02:04:14.713 --> 02:04:16.415
SOMETHING THAT WAS ROBUST AND

02:04:16.482 --> 02:04:22.555
ADOPTABLE. BY THE INDUSTRY. HI

02:04:22.621 --> 02:04:23.656
SO WHY CAN'T WE USE SAME IN PART

02:04:23.722 --> 02:04:24.757
OF THE PARTY THE REALLY THE BIG

02:04:24.824 --> 02:04:27.293
REASON IS BECAUSE- THE CULTURE

02:04:27.359 --> 02:04:29.528
OF AGRICULTURE WITHIN OUR REGION

02:04:29.595 --> 02:04:31.664
AND SO OF THE SPECIALTY CROP

02:04:31.730 --> 02:04:33.999
INDUSTRY HERE IS VERY STRONG

02:04:34.066 --> 02:04:36.068
IT'S VERY DIVERSE AND VERY

02:04:36.135 --> 02:04:38.103
DYNAMIC AND SO I MENTION THIS

02:04:38.170 --> 02:04:41.507
IDEA OF CROP ROTATIONS- REALLY

02:04:41.574 --> 02:04:44.243
TO- TO- WITH LEAF BLOWERS AND

02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:45.644
HAD LESS BEING REALLY SOME OF

02:04:45.711 --> 02:04:48.314
OUR BIGGEST- CROPS WITHIN OUR

02:04:48.380 --> 02:04:49.715
REGION YOU LOOK AT THE

02:04:49.782 --> 02:04:51.250
CONTRIBUTION THAT'S COMING OUT

02:04:51.317 --> 02:04:52.551
OF MONTEREY COUNTY IT'S

02:04:52.618 --> 02:04:55.020
ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT TO SECURE-

02:04:55.087 --> 02:04:57.056
BOTH THE STABILITY OF BEING ABLE

02:04:57.122 --> 02:04:58.057
TO PRODUCE THESE CROPS TO

02:04:58.123 --> 02:05:00.960
STAYING UP LATE AS WE MOVE

02:05:01.026 --> 02:05:03.195
FORWARD IN THE FUTURE. FIVE JUST

02:05:03.262 --> 02:05:04.496
REALLY MY LAST FLIGHT HERE JUST

02:05:04.563 --> 02:05:06.632
LOOKING AT IBM FROM A HOLISTIC.

02:05:06.699 --> 02:05:08.300
STANDPOINT AND SO THESE ARE ALL

02:05:08.367 --> 02:05:11.337
THINGS THAT- I THINK ABOUT THAT

02:05:11.403 --> 02:05:13.105
I THINK JP AND EVERYONE ELSE IN

02:05:13.172 --> 02:05:14.273
THIS ROOM BEHIND ME THINKS

02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:15.941
ABOUT. AS OUT WERE NOT JUST

02:05:16.008 --> 02:05:17.409
CENTERED IN THAT GREEN CIRCLE

02:05:17.476 --> 02:05:18.811
WITHIN THE MIDDLE THERE THAT

02:05:18.878 --> 02:05:21.247
SAYS TAX MANAGEMENT. BUT WERE

02:05:21.313 --> 02:05:22.615
INVOLVED IN ALL OF THESE OTHER

02:05:22.681 --> 02:05:24.283
PARTS TO REALLY DEVELOP

02:05:24.350 --> 02:05:26.652
SOMETHING THAT IS. ACCEPTABLE

02:05:26.719 --> 02:05:28.254
SOCIALLY ECONOMICALLY AND

02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:30.656
ENVIRONMENTALLY. AND THE TOOLBOX
