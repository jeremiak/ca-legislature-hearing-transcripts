ADDRESSED ON. IN A VERY

00:43:41.986 --> 00:43:43.554
RESPONSIBLE WAY BUT THE

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.089

RESPECTED. IN THE BUREAUCRACY

00:44:01.772 --> 00:44:02.806
SOMETIMES PEOPLE FEEL A

00:44:02.873 --> 00:44:04.575
GOVERNMENT JUST HAVE THEIR THEY

00:44:04.641 --> 00:44:06.010
NOD THEIR HEAD THAT THEY DON'T

THEIR HEARTS SO. WHAT'S YOUR

00:44:09.013 --> 00:44:11.582

ARE OUR NEW SCHOOL TO BE WE

00:44:30.134 --> 00:44:30.634
DON'T KNOW BECAUSE NOW WITH

THAT'S GOING TO IN THE FEW. BUT

00:44:31.535 --> 00:44:32.569
I DO THINK THAT AND I DISCUSS

00:44:32.636 --> 00:44:34.571
ABOUT MODERNIZING THE AGENCY

00:44:34.638 --> 00:44:37.975
AND BEING- I'M MORE ACCESSIBLE

00:44:38.042 --> 00:44:39.276
IT'S THE SORT OF THING WHERE

00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:41.011
WERE OPENED USING ALL THE

00:44:41.078 --> 00:44:43.914
TECHNOLOGIES YOU KNOW- FOR MANY

00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:46.150
YEARS AT LEAST 70% OF ALL OR

00:44:46.216 --> 00:44:48.952

00:44:51.922 --> 00:44:52.923
WHAT WE'RE DOING. BUT IT'S MY

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:58.629
FEELING THAT. WE WILL- I GUESS

00:44:58.695 --> 00:45:00.998

DIFFERENTLY IN THE FUTURE WE'RE

00:45:03.333 --> 00:45:05.202
STILL FIGURING THAT OUT BUT THE

00:45:05.269 --> 00:45:06.203
ONE THING THAT I WANTED TO ALSO

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:08.005
MENTION IS THAT WE ALSO REALIZE

00:45:08.072 --> 00:45:09.940
THERE'S MANY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT

00:45:10.007 --> 00:45:11.742
HAVE ACCESS TO BROADBAND WHO DO

00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:14.244

TECH CAPACITY FOR THOSE FOLKS

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:27.291
WE'RE NOT FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO

00:45:27.357 --> 00:45:30.060
BE ABLE TO USE THE EQUIPMENT

00:45:30.127 --> 00:45:31.195
