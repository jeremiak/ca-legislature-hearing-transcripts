00:44:45.282 --> 00:44:46.617
PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED

00:44:46.683 --> 00:44:47.885

CHAIR- I THINK THAT THE WHAT I

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.695
LIKE ABOUT THE BILL IS THAT IT

00:45:31.762 --> 00:45:33.697
DOES TRY TO FIND SOME BALANCE

00:45:33.764 --> 00:45:34.965
WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT WE

00:45:35.032 --> 00:45:37.101

00:45:37.167 --> 00:45:39.203
BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT.

00:45:39.269 --> 00:45:41.772

SICK EMPLOYEES DON'T GO TO WORK

00:45:49.746 --> 00:45:51.381
SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

00:45:51.448 --> 00:45:53.350
GOING TO RECEIVE ANY BENEFITS.

00:45:53.417 --> 00:45:54.985

COMES FROM A SMALL BUSINESS

00:53:39.082 --> 00:53:40.984
PERSPECTIVE IN A WORLD I'M

00:53:41.051 --> 00:53:43.253
REALLY CONCERNED THAT WHEN ARE

BUSINESSES ACROSS CALIFORNIA

00:53:45.622 --> 00:53:46.790
HAVE REALLY STEPPED UP TO THE

00:53:46.856 --> 00:53:48.525
PLATE OVER THE LAST YEAR. I'VE

00:53:48.592 --> 00:53:49.926
HEARD STORIES FROM EMPLOYERS

00:53:49.993 --> 00:53:51.595
AND COMPANIES IN MY DISTRICT TO

00:53:51.661 --> 00:53:53.396
HAVE KEPT EMPLOYEES ON JUST SO

00:53:53.463 --> 00:53:53.997
THAT THEY WOULD EVEN THOUGH

00:53:54.064 --> 00:53:55.632
THEY HAD NO WORK JUST SO THEY

00:53:55.699 --> 00:53:56.566
COULD CONTINUE THEIR HEALTH

00:53:56.633 --> 00:53:58.234
INSURANCE. SO I'M REALLY

00:53:58.301 --> 00:53:58.969
CONCERNED THAT WE'RE NOT TAKING

00:53:59.035 --> 00:54:00.670
A BALANCED APPROACH APPROACH

00:54:00.737 --> 00:54:02.205
WITH THIS. I DO WANT TO KNOW

00:54:02.272 --> 00:54:04.541

BUSINESSES. THAT TWENTY FIVE

00:54:21.291 --> 00:54:23.927
EMPLOYEES OR LESS- WAS A POINT

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:26.062
THAT SEEM TO COINCIDE WITH SOME

00:54:26.129 --> 00:54:27.497
OF THE SMALL BUSINESS

00:54:27.564 --> 00:54:29.766
ADMINISTRATION- PROPOSALS AT

00:54:29.833 --> 00:54:30.867

BUSINESSES AGAIN WE'LL GET YOU

00:54:36.806 --> 00:54:37.240
THAT NUMBER BUT WITH IN

00:54:37.307 --> 00:54:38.475
CALIFORNIA. IT IS JUST

00:54:38.541 --> 00:54:40.477
CONCERNING THAT WE PICKED THIS

00:54:40.543 --> 00:54:42.312
NUMBER YET WE DON'T REALLY KNOW

00:54:42.379 --> 00:54:44.014
HOW IT IMPACTS THE VAST

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:52.255
MAJORITY OF BUSINESSES. THANK

00:54:52.322 --> 00:54:55.925
YOU MISS MCCARTY. YEAH I KNOW

00:54:55.992 --> 00:54:56.660
THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL

00:54:56.726 --> 00:54:58.361
HEARING WE'RE NOT VOTING AGES

00:54:58.428 --> 00:55:00.797
FLESHING OUT THE DETAILS AND I

00:55:00.864 --> 00:55:02.132
JUST WANT TO POINT OUT TWO

00:55:02.198 --> 00:55:02.832
THINGS WHICH I THINK ARE

00:55:02.899 --> 00:55:05.201
IMPORTANT- FIRST IS WORK IN THE

00:55:05.268 --> 00:55:06.770
MIDDLE OF PANDEMIC AND

00:55:06.836 --> 00:55:08.038
HOPEFULLY WILL BE OVER IN THE

00:55:08.104 --> 00:55:09.739
COMING MONTHS AND VACCINES ARE

00:55:09.806 --> 00:55:10.440
ROLLING OUT AND THINGS ARE

00:55:10.507 --> 00:55:12.042
CERTAINLY CHANGING AND WE DO

00:55:12.108 --> 00:55:13.777
HAVE AN END DATE FOR THIS

00:55:13.843 --> 00:55:15.478
POLICY AS MISTER. AS MY

00:55:15.545 --> 00:55:16.913
COLLEAGUE FROM SAMBAR DINO ASKS

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:18.515
WHO WAS IT WAS REITERATED THAT

00:55:18.581 --> 00:55:19.482
WE DO HAVE AN END DATE FOR

00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:22.085
THIS. AND THEN I THINK TO NOTE.

00:55:22.152 --> 00:55:23.853
THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:25.455
OF PEOPLE THAT ARE EMPLOYED BY

00:55:25.522 --> 00:55:26.656
SMALL BUSINESS AND KEEP IN THE

00:55:26.723 --> 00:55:28.258
UNITED STATES IN CALIFORNIA.

00:55:28.324 --> 00:55:30.160
THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE FROM

00:55:30.226 --> 00:55:32.028
SMALLER BUSINESSES OF. LESS

00:55:32.095 --> 00:55:34.130
THAN FIFTEEN LESS THAN TEN LESS

00:55:34.197 --> 00:55:35.899
THAN FIVE. LAST YEAR WE HAD THE

00:55:35.965 --> 00:55:37.367
BIG CONTROVERSIAL DEBATE ON

00:55:37.434 --> 00:55:39.302
PAID FAMILY LEAVE. I BELIEVE

00:55:39.369 --> 00:55:41.705
THE FINAL- NUMBER WAS MUCH MUCH

00:55:41.771 --> 00:55:43.573
LOWER. SO BY THE FACT THAT

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.542
WE'RE GOING UP TO TWENTY FIVE I

00:55:45.608 --> 00:55:47.277
THINK. HAS SOME RECOGNITION

00:55:47.343 --> 00:55:48.445
THAT THE SMALLER BUSINESSES

00:55:48.511 --> 00:55:50.580
WITH. THE MAJORITY OF ISN'T

00:55:50.647 --> 00:55:52.015
CALIFORNIA HAVE JUST A FEW

00:55:52.082 --> 00:55:53.750
EMPLOYEES AND THEY DON'T HAVE.

00:55:53.817 --> 00:55:57.087
PERSONNEL TO TEAMS IN PAYROLL-

00:55:57.153 --> 00:55:57.987
TEAMS AND CONSULTANTS ALL

00:55:58.054 --> 00:55:59.856
FIGURED OUT. SO I THINK BY THE

00:55:59.923 --> 00:56:01.157
FACT THAT WE ARE GOING TO

00:56:01.224 --> 00:56:02.592
TWENTY FIVE. IT'S A FAIR

00:56:02.659 --> 00:56:05.128
COMPROMISE HIS TO FALL BECAUSE

00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:05.829
ONE THERE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN

00:56:05.895 --> 00:56:07.230
CALIFORNIA WHO ARE GOING TO GET

00:56:07.297 --> 00:56:08.665
SICK YOU CAN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE

00:56:08.732 --> 00:56:10.533
OF THIS BECAUSE THEY WORK. FOR

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:11.901
AN EMPLOYER WITH UNDER TWENTY

00:56:11.968 --> 00:56:12.836
FIVE IN THE MAJORITY PEOPLE IN

00:56:12.902 --> 00:56:14.738
CALIFORNIA. FRANKLY WON'T BE

00:56:14.804 --> 00:56:16.206
ABLE TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE

00:56:16.272 --> 00:56:18.208
THEY WORK FOR. AN EMPLOYER.

00:56:18.274 --> 00:56:20.410
THAT HAS FEWER THAN TWENTY FIVE

00:56:20.477 --> 00:56:23.179
EMPLOYEES SO- I THINK THAT- YOU

00:56:23.246 --> 00:56:24.447
KNOW MANY WOULD PUSH THE OTHER

00:56:24.514 --> 00:56:26.382
WAY THAT WE SHOULD GO DOWN TO

00:56:26.449 --> 00:56:28.184
FIVE OR LESS. OR EVEN FEWER SO

00:56:28.251 --> 00:56:29.152
I JUST THINK WE NEED TO MAKE

00:56:29.219 --> 00:56:32.789
SURE WE- RECONCILE THOSE TWO

00:56:32.856 --> 00:56:36.159
FACTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU OF

00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:46.870

I DON'T QUESTION THEIR AGO BOB.

00:56:50.106 --> 00:56:51.541
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT

00:56:51.608 --> 00:56:54.477
THAT THE IMPORTANT THING HERE

00:56:54.544 --> 00:56:55.979
IS THAT WE'RE MAKING A GOOD

00:56:56.045 --> 00:56:58.448
FAITH EFFORT TO TRY TO PROTECT

00:56:58.515 --> 00:57:00.283
WORKERS AND STILL COME UP WITH

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:02.352
SOME KIND OF BALANCE SAYS- MY

00:57:02.418 --> 00:57:05.054
COLLEAGUE- MENTIONED IN WHEN

00:57:05.121 --> 00:57:08.391
YOU HAVE PROTECTIONS BUILT IN

00:57:08.458 --> 00:57:11.728
FOR EXAMPLE. THE EMPLOYER CAN

00:57:11.795 --> 00:57:13.730
MAKE THE EMPLOYEE HOLE. ONE

00:57:13.797 --> 00:57:17.467
NOTIFIED OF AN ERROR MESSAGE-

00:57:17.534 --> 00:57:19.569
THAT I THINK REALLY INDICATES

00:57:19.636 --> 00:57:21.538
WE ARE MAKING A GOOD FAITH

00:57:21.604 --> 00:57:23.339
EFFORT. IT'S ONLY THE BAD

00:57:23.406 --> 00:57:25.341
ACTORS THAT YOU REALLY TRYING

00:57:25.408 --> 00:57:27.477
TO FORCES LEGISLATION DOWN AND

00:57:27.544 --> 00:57:29.712
MOST WORK SITUATIONS ONCE THIS

00:57:29.779 --> 00:57:31.681
LEGISLATION IS AFTER AND IT'S

00:57:31.748 --> 00:57:34.217
ONLY FOR EMPLOYERS OF TWENTY

00:57:34.284 --> 00:57:37.053
FIVE OR MORE- I THINK YOU YOU

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.389
CAN CERTAINLY CALDERON-

00:57:39.455 --> 00:57:40.657
EVERYBODY THAT'S TRYING TO MAKE

00:57:40.723 --> 00:57:42.258
A GOOD FAITH EFFORT. WILL NOT

00:57:42.325 --> 00:57:43.359
GET TRIPPED UP WITH SOME

00:57:43.426 --> 00:57:45.295

00:57:57.073 --> 00:57:59.342
OF US. IN THE PAST YEAR AS WE

REACH THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY

00:58:00.944 --> 00:58:02.912
OF OUR GOING INTO QUARANTINE

00:58:02.979 --> 00:58:05.982
AND- REALLY THAT THE IMPACT OF

00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:07.784
COPA NINETEEN WE HAVE ALL.

00:58:07.851 --> 00:58:10.019

IN THIS BODY IN THIS BUILDING

00:58:11.588 --> 00:58:13.456
THAT HAS BEEN COLD BUT POSITIVE

00:58:13.523 --> 00:58:15.091
WE HAVE ALL BEEN IMPACTED BY

00:58:15.158 --> 00:58:18.561
SOMEONE WHO HAS. UNFORTUNATELY

NINETEEN AND IT IS. INCREDIBLY

00:58:28.338 --> 00:58:30.039
PAINFUL IT IS PAINFUL TO THINK

00:58:30.106 --> 00:58:31.774
ABOUT ESSENTIAL AND FRONTLINE

00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:33.109

THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS

00:58:38.514 --> 00:58:40.550
COULD STAY HOME AND QUARANTINE
