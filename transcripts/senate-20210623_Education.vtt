00:26:59.317 --> 00:27:00.819
KIND OF PUT THE CLASS TOGETHER

00:27:00.885 --> 00:27:01.953
EIGHT SO YOU DON'T EVERYONE TO

LOOK THE SAME- AS WELL BUT AT

00:27:04.956 --> 00:27:05.757
THE SAME TIME AS A LOOK AT THIS

00:27:05.824 --> 00:27:08.593
BILL- I DON'T SEE PROVISIONS

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:10.261
THAT REQUIRE YOU TO SENSE THE

00:27:10.328 --> 00:27:11.997
USE ONE STANDARDIZED APPROACH

00:27:12.063 --> 00:27:12.697
TO DO THIS I MEAN THEIR

00:27:12.764 --> 00:27:14.265
STANDARDS THERE'S PIECES IN

00:27:14.332 --> 00:27:16.234
HERE TO SAY. THAT THE FOR

00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:18.236
ACCOUNTABILITY SO I GUESS MY

00:27:18.303 --> 00:27:20.605
QUESTION TO YOU SEE IS THAT-

00:27:20.672 --> 00:27:22.440

COOKIE CUTTER ADMISSION PROCESS

00:27:30.548 --> 00:27:33.018
THAT WOULD ONLY ALLOW. SO I

00:27:33.084 --> 00:27:34.452
DON'T REALLY SEE THAT IN THE

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:37.122
BILL- SO. IN THE ACTUAL BILL

00:27:37.188 --> 00:27:39.924

THE PROVISION AND- THAT KIND OF

00:27:54.339 --> 00:27:57.175
ACCESS TO- DOUBLES WHAT THE

00:27:57.242 --> 00:28:00.111
METHODOLOGY IS- FOR SELECTION

00:28:00.178 --> 00:28:03.114
OF- THAT MISSION- WHY THAT. WE

00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:05.683

THEY'RE ASKING FOR IS REALLY

00:28:25.804 --> 00:28:28.406
ASKING FOR A FORMULA WHICH OUR

00:28:28.473 --> 00:28:30.141
ADMISSION PROCESS IN USE OF

00:28:30.208 --> 00:28:31.509
COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW THERE IS

00:28:31.576 --> 00:28:34.045
NO FORMULA CAMPUSES ARE TAKING

00:28:34.112 --> 00:28:35.814

THEIR ACADEMIC. AND EDUCATIONAL

00:28:42.087 --> 00:28:43.655
OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY HAVE

00:28:43.721 --> 00:28:44.956

IS GIVEN TO Y. WHEN THOSE KINDS

00:28:56.701 --> 00:28:59.003
OF WEIGHTS ARE NEVER A WIDE THE

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:00.905
ENTIRE APPLICATION PORTFOLIO IS

00:29:00.972 --> 00:29:03.741
LOOKED AT. AND THE STAFF IS

00:29:03.808 --> 00:29:05.844
MADE FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL FOR

SELECTION METHODOLOGY. THE

00:29:17.689 --> 00:29:19.224
OTHER THING IS THAT. OKAY SO I

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:20.658
UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE CONCERNS

00:29:20.725 --> 00:29:23.228
ABOUT HOW THE AUDITOR MIGHT GO

00:29:23.294 --> 00:29:25.130
ABOUT DOING THIS PERHAPS NOW.

00:29:25.196 --> 00:29:27.065
POSE A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR

00:29:27.132 --> 00:29:27.665
YOU'VE HEARD THE CONCERN FROM

00:29:27.732 --> 00:29:30.835
YOU SEE- DOES YOUR BILL

00:29:30.902 --> 00:29:33.271
ACTUALLY REQUIRES SUCH. THEY

00:29:33.338 --> 00:29:36.808
ALL WENT WHEN IT DOES- CALL ON

00:29:36.875 --> 00:29:38.109
ACTUALLY DOES REQUIRE YOU SEE A

00:29:38.176 --> 00:29:39.944
P. TO STEP OF SYSTEM WIDE

00:29:40.011 --> 00:29:44.048
PROTOCOLS. TO AND REQUIRED

00:29:44.115 --> 00:29:45.150
CAMPUSES UNIVERSITY TAKE THE

00:29:45.216 --> 00:29:46.451
FOLLOWING ACTIONS SO I GUESS

00:29:46.518 --> 00:29:48.553
THAT'S FOR INTERNAL BUT PART IS

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.321
THAT THE NATURE OF THE-

00:29:50.388 --> 00:29:54.392
METHODOLOGY CAN USE- SO HOW HOW

00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:55.994
DETAILED METHODOLOGY ARE. YOU

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:58.263
INTENDING AND IN THIS

00:29:58.329 --> 00:30:00.331
PARTICULAR BILL- GIVEN WHAT THE-

00:30:00.398 --> 00:30:02.500
LUCY'S CAN RAY CHARLES ARMS YES

00:30:02.567 --> 00:30:03.168
I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT

00:30:03.234 --> 00:30:04.435
QUESTION THEN I'LL PASS IT OVER

00:30:04.502 --> 00:30:05.970
THE STATE ORDER OUR INTENTION

00:30:06.037 --> 00:30:07.872
WITH THIS IS THAT YOU HAVE A

00:30:07.939 --> 00:30:09.307
SET OF RULES WHEN YOU GET TO

00:30:09.374 --> 00:30:10.708
THAT COMPETITIVE SYSTEM A

00:30:10.775 --> 00:30:12.744
COMPETITIVE POOL. THAT YOU

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:13.811
DECIDE IN EVERY CAMPUS CAN DO

00:30:13.878 --> 00:30:15.747
IT DIFFERENTLY RIGHT WHAT ARE

00:30:15.813 --> 00:30:17.482
THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO IT

00:30:17.549 --> 00:30:19.384
TO THE SIDE WHO ARE YOU GONNA

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:21.252
DO WHO ARE YOU GOING TO MET AND

00:30:21.319 --> 00:30:23.121
WHY WOULD HAVE LESS OBJECTIVELY

00:30:23.188 --> 00:30:25.023
LESS. QUALIFIED STUDENT BE

00:30:25.089 --> 00:30:27.258
OMITTED ALL WE'RE ASKING THEM

00:30:27.325 --> 00:30:30.028
TO DO IS PUT THEIR OWN CRITERIA

00:30:30.094 --> 00:30:31.062
WE DO THAT FOR EVERYTHING. IT'S

00:30:31.129 --> 00:30:32.697
NOT UNREASONABLE TO ASK THAT

00:30:32.764 --> 00:30:35.233
THE CRITERIA. ARE OBJECTIVE AND

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.101
LAID OUT AHEAD OF TIME. TO

00:30:37.168 --> 00:30:39.504
AVOID PREFERENCES THAT HAPPEN

00:30:39.571 --> 00:30:40.772
AND HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED

00:30:40.838 --> 00:30:41.773
THROUGH THE AUDIT TO HAVE

00:30:41.839 --> 00:30:43.374
HAPPENED. SO WITH THAT I'LL

00:30:43.441 --> 00:30:46.044
TURN OVER TO A PODCAST- AND THE

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:47.745
POINTS ABOUT. HAVING A COOKIE

00:30:47.812 --> 00:30:49.147
CUTTER APPROACH ARE WELL TAKEN

00:30:49.214 --> 00:30:50.481
IT ISN'T THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS

00:30:50.548 --> 00:30:51.549
ALREADY COVERED THE BASIC GIST

00:30:51.616 --> 00:30:53.418
OF. OF WHY WE MADE THIS

00:30:53.484 --> 00:30:54.686
RECOMMENDATION WHICH IS THAT

00:30:54.752 --> 00:30:55.987
WHEN WE WENT TO THE CAMPUSES

00:30:56.054 --> 00:30:57.055
THAT WE VISITED DURING THIS

00:30:57.121 --> 00:30:58.690
ITEM WHICH WAS UCLA BERKELEY

00:30:58.756 --> 00:31:01.593
AND SAN DIEGO. AT UCLA AND UC

00:31:01.659 --> 00:31:03.962
BERKELEY. WHEN WE ASKED WHY

00:31:04.028 --> 00:31:05.830
WERE APPLICANTS THAT THROUGH

00:31:05.897 --> 00:31:06.864
THE COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW

00:31:06.931 --> 00:31:08.766
PROCESS HAD BEEN ASSIGNED LOWER

00:31:08.833 --> 00:31:11.936
RATINGS. ADMITTED WHEN HIGHER

00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:14.439
RATED INDIVIDUALS HAD NOT BEEN.

00:31:14.505 --> 00:31:15.273
UNIVERSITY COULD NOT EXPLAIN TO

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.308
US WHY. OKAY IT'S NOT TO SAY

00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:18.676
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A REASON

00:31:18.743 --> 00:31:19.777
IT'S JUST THAT THERE WAS NO

00:31:19.844 --> 00:31:21.312
METHODOLOGY LAID OUT AHEAD OF

00:31:21.379 --> 00:31:23.248
TIME THAT THEY COULD POINT US

00:31:23.314 --> 00:31:24.649
TO SAY. WELL THIS IS HOW WE

00:31:24.716 --> 00:31:26.150
WERE BUILDING OUR CLASS THIS IS

00:31:26.217 --> 00:31:27.852
HOW WE WORK. PRIORITIZING

00:31:27.919 --> 00:31:29.287
CERTAIN OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE

00:31:29.354 --> 00:31:31.256
STUDENTS PROFILE TO. BUILD THE

00:31:31.322 --> 00:31:32.590
TYPE OF CLASS WE WANTED THIS

00:31:32.657 --> 00:31:33.925
YEAR THEY DIDN'T HAVE THAT

00:31:33.992 --> 00:31:35.360
METHODOLOGY AND JUST TO CLARIFY

00:31:35.426 --> 00:31:36.628
WHEN YOU SAY LOW RATED HIGH

00:31:36.694 --> 00:31:38.029
RATED WAS AT THE UNIVERSITY'S

00:31:38.096 --> 00:31:39.330
OWN RATING OR SEPARATING YOU

00:31:39.397 --> 00:31:40.198
ASSIGNED THAT IS THE

00:31:40.265 --> 00:31:42.166
UNIVERSITY'S OWN RATING GIVEN

00:31:42.233 --> 00:31:45.069
BY ITS APPLICATION REVIEWERS.

00:31:45.136 --> 00:31:48.973
OKAY ALL RIGHT- OKAY SO I GUESS

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:52.076
I'D SAY IS THAT- I THINK THIS

00:31:52.143 --> 00:31:55.280
IS A VERY IMPORTANT- I'M GOING

00:31:55.346 --> 00:31:55.813
CONVERSATION I NOTICED THE

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.116
SECOND HOUSE TO I THINK PERHAPS

00:31:58.182 --> 00:32:00.084
SOME CLARITY ON WHAT IS MEANT

00:32:00.151 --> 00:32:02.320
BY METHODOLOGY I AGREE WITH

00:32:02.387 --> 00:32:04.956
THAT THE UNIVERSITY ITSELF IN

00:32:05.023 --> 00:32:06.224
ITS OWN RIGHT NOW I'D HAVE TO

00:32:06.291 --> 00:32:07.458
BE ALSO LITTLE CLASSES WE SAY

00:32:07.525 --> 00:32:09.227
REVEALED THAT AGAIN I WOULD

00:32:09.294 --> 00:32:10.628
HAVE BEEN A LOT OF THE

00:32:10.695 --> 00:32:12.797
UNDERGRADUATE REVIEW PROCESS.

00:32:12.864 --> 00:32:15.233
THERE IS THERE IS A ROLE IN

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.168
WHICH ANYONE SO WHEN YOU LOOK

00:32:17.235 --> 00:32:19.604
AT THE INDIVIDUAL EVALUATION OF

00:32:19.671 --> 00:32:21.339
AN INDIVIDUAL CANDIDATE AND

00:32:21.406 --> 00:32:22.607
THEN USED SIR THINK ABOUT HOW

00:32:22.674 --> 00:32:25.043
YOU BUILD A CLASS SOMETIMES BUT

00:32:25.109 --> 00:32:25.943
I ALSO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:27.078
SAYING WHEN THEY CAN'T JSTIFY

00:32:27.145 --> 00:32:28.012
WHAT YOU NEED TO YOU SHOULD BE

00:32:28.079 --> 00:32:29.247
ABLE EXPLAIN LIKE WHAT WHAT

00:32:29.314 --> 00:32:30.515
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS A SIDE

00:32:30.581 --> 00:32:31.115
BILL THE CLASS WITH A CERTAIN

00:32:31.182 --> 00:32:33.284
BALANCE AND SO WHAT WE DID IS

00:32:33.351 --> 00:32:34.719
WE HAD A GROUP OF STUDENTS HERE

00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:36.454
THAT SEEMED A LITTLE BIT WHAT'S

00:32:36.521 --> 00:32:38.256
UNDER FEEL WAITED IN TERMS OF

00:32:38.323 --> 00:32:39.223
THE CLASS DISTRIBUTION WE

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:40.425
LOOKED AT ALL THE THING AND SO

00:32:40.491 --> 00:32:42.360
WE- TRIED IT MORE THE THEATER

00:32:42.427 --> 00:32:43.227
THAT. WITH THESE

00:32:43.294 --> 00:32:45.563
CHARACTERISTICS ETCETERA THAT-

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:46.698
ALTHOUGH I THINK IT'S A LITTLE

00:32:46.764 --> 00:32:48.700
CHALLENGING ASSERTED AND THAT

00:32:48.766 --> 00:32:50.535
SORT OF QUOTE WEIGHTED DEL- PUT

00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:53.338
IT OUT IN ADVANCE OF THE OTHER

00:32:53.404 --> 00:32:55.740
AND FAIRLY BROAD TERMS- BUT- I

00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:56.941
PERHAPS THERE CAN BE SOME

00:32:57.008 --> 00:32:58.343
ADDITIONAL WORK DONE I'M JUST

00:32:58.409 --> 00:33:00.178
CLARIFYING WHAT YOU MEAN BY

00:33:00.244 --> 00:33:01.646
METHODOLOGY BECAUSE I ALSO

00:33:01.713 --> 00:33:03.514
THINK THAT IT'S ALSO DANGEROUS

00:33:03.581 --> 00:33:05.083
TO GO DOWN A PATH WHERE YOU

00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:06.250
KNOW WE TURN EVERYTHING INTO A

00:33:06.317 --> 00:33:08.119
NUMBER AND THEN WE SAY WE TRY

00:33:08.186 --> 00:33:09.420
TO BALANCE THAT OUT TOO BECAUSE

00:33:09.487 --> 00:33:10.755
I THINK- THAT ACTUALLY GOT TO

00:33:10.822 --> 00:33:13.224
BE DISADVANTAGES DISADVANTAGES

00:33:13.291 --> 00:33:19.230
TO. CERTAIN TYPES OF APPLICANTS.

00:33:19.297 --> 00:33:20.298
OPTICALLY ON. THOSE WITH FEWER

00:33:20.365 --> 00:33:21.866
OP. SO IT'S A UP A SCHOOL IN

00:33:21.933 --> 00:33:23.134
THE NUMBER OF EXTRACURRICULAR.

00:33:23.201 --> 00:33:24.035
ARE TYPES OF RIGHT WE SAW BE

00:33:24.102 --> 00:33:25.570
CAREFUL NOT DOING THAT KIND OF

00:33:25.636 --> 00:33:27.905
THING AS WELL- BUT CERTAIN I

00:33:27.972 --> 00:33:29.741
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT-

00:33:29.807 --> 00:33:31.809
DISCUSSION TO CONTINUE FORWARD.

00:33:31.876 --> 00:33:34.112
HOPEFULLY PERHAPS WE CAN TRY TO.

00:33:34.178 --> 00:33:35.346
CLARIFIED ADDRESS SOME OF THE

00:33:35.413 --> 00:33:37.849
CONCERNS OF YOU SEE. ON THAT

00:33:37.915 --> 00:33:39.350
AND SO WITH THAT CERTAINLY I

00:33:39.417 --> 00:33:40.551
WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL BUT

00:33:40.618 --> 00:33:41.652
HOPE YOU'LL WORK WITH YOU SEE

00:33:41.719 --> 00:33:43.454
PERHAPS JUST TO CLARIFY WHAT

00:33:43.521 --> 00:33:44.355
YOU MEAN BY METHODOLOGY IN A

00:33:44.422 --> 00:33:47.058
WAY THAT- DOESN'T OVERLY

00:33:47.125 --> 00:33:49.961
RESTRICT. THE ADMISSIONS.

00:33:50.027 --> 00:33:53.898
PROCESS BUT ALSO. AGAIN CALLED

POLITICAL SCIENCE WE WERE

00:34:01.038 --> 00:34:02.507
TAUGHT BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND

00:34:02.573 --> 00:34:04.242
QUALITATIVE METHODS. SO I THINK

00:34:04.308 --> 00:34:06.411
METHODOLOGY JUST MEANS THAT

00:34:06.477 --> 00:34:08.312
THEY HAVE A PLAN AND THEY KNOW

00:34:08.379 --> 00:34:09.447
HOW THEY'RE BUILDING THAT

00:34:09.514 --> 00:34:12.850
CLASS. VERSUS NECESSARILY BEING

00:34:12.917 --> 00:34:14.118
A QUANTITATIVE FORMULA. THANK

00:34:14.185 --> 00:34:15.253

AND FEWER OVERSIGHT IN THE

00:34:27.064 --> 00:34:27.565
SPACE I MEAN CERTAINLY IT'S

00:34:27.632 --> 00:34:29.700
THAT. THE KIND OF ISSUE THAT'S

00:34:29.767 --> 00:34:32.470
PRICKLY AND MY COMMUNITY WHEN-

00:34:32.537 --> 00:34:34.639
SO MANY QUALIFIED STUDENTS- HAD

00:34:34.705 --> 00:34:36.474
SET THEIR GOAL TO ATTEND THE

00:34:36.541 --> 00:34:40.211
UC. AND THEN- STRUGGLE AND-

00:34:40.278 --> 00:34:42.079
WHEN THOSE RESULTS COMMAND AND

00:34:42.146 --> 00:34:44.682
THEY WONDER WHY- ONE CLASSMATE

00:34:44.749 --> 00:34:46.384
YES ONE CLASS RIGHT NOW I MEAN

00:34:46.451 --> 00:34:48.319
IT'S A STRESSFUL PLACE I KNOW

00:34:48.386 --> 00:34:49.887
IN THE LEGISLATURE YOU KNOW WE

00:34:49.954 --> 00:34:50.888
ARE SENSITIVE TO WHAT WE'RE

00:34:50.955 --> 00:34:53.424
TRYING TO FIND. UC AND CSU MORE

00:34:53.491 --> 00:34:55.092
SO THERE'S MORE SLOTS AND

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:55.760
THERE'S AN EFFORT IN OUR BUDGET

00:34:55.827 --> 00:34:58.429
PROPOSAL- THIS YEAR TO TRY TO

00:34:58.496 --> 00:34:59.530
BUY OUT SOME OF THE OUT OF

00:34:59.597 --> 00:35:01.098
STATE. STUDENTS SO THAT IT

00:35:01.165 --> 00:35:02.633
COULD BE GREATER IGNITION SO I

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.670
KNOW THAT WE ALL SHARE

00:35:05.736 --> 00:35:07.905
TOGETHER- THE IN THE GOAL OF

FROM SACRAMENTO HAS RAISED. IT

00:35:33.931 --> 00:35:35.399
SEEMS THAT IN YOUR INNER CHANGE

00:35:35.466 --> 00:35:36.767
THAT THE ISSUE IS NOT THAT IT

00:35:36.834 --> 00:35:39.570
IS. A DISCLOSE METHODOLOGY BUT

00:35:39.637 --> 00:35:40.938
THAT THERE IS ON THE CAMPUS OF

00:35:41.005 --> 00:35:43.541
METHODOLOGY. THAT'S DOCUMENTED

00:35:43.608 --> 00:35:45.243
NOT TO BE THE SECRET SAUCE THAT

NOT GOING ON. A THE AUDITOR

00:36:41.432 --> 00:36:45.570
SUGGESTS THAT IT HASN'T BEEN

00:36:45.636 --> 00:36:46.170

EVERY READER HAS TO BE.

00:36:53.678 --> 00:36:55.947
CERTIFIED ANNUALLY THEY GO

00:36:56.013 --> 00:36:57.381
THROUGH EXTENSIVE TRAINING

00:36:57.448 --> 00:36:59.216
INCLUDING IN INCLUDING IMPLICIT

00:36:59.283 --> 00:37:02.386
BIAS TRAINING. AND I BELIEVE

THAT IN OUR LAB. TECHNICIAN TO

00:37:04.822 --> 00:37:07.058
THE STATE AUDITOR WE HAD

00:37:07.124 --> 00:37:08.092
IDENTIFIED THIS IS A

00:37:08.159 --> 00:37:09.360
RECOMMENDATION THAT WAS FULLY

00:37:09.427 --> 00:37:11.429
IMPLEMENTED AND YET. AND THE

00:37:11.495 --> 00:37:13.965
RESPONSE WE RECEIVED BACK WAS

00:37:14.031 --> 00:37:14.632
THAT IT WAS ONLY PARTIALLY

00:37:14.699 --> 00:37:18.436
IMPLEMENTED. SO ALSO THE TIMING

00:37:18.502 --> 00:37:22.306
OF THE COMMISSION. WITH IN THE-

00:37:22.373 --> 00:37:23.774
WORLD LIKE IN THE VERY CHEAP

00:37:23.841 --> 00:37:25.343
THE ROAD OF THE ADMISSION

00:37:25.409 --> 00:37:26.711
SEASON AND SO IT'S VERY

00:37:26.777 --> 00:37:29.347
DIFFICULT OUR CAMPUS IS TO-

00:37:29.413 --> 00:37:31.549
RESPOND IN A VERY THOROUGH WAY

00:37:31.616 --> 00:37:33.150
BECAUSE- THE BUSINESS OF. IN

00:37:33.217 --> 00:37:36.754
THERE THEY WERE IN THE MIDDLE

00:37:36.821 --> 00:37:40.791
OF THE ADMISSION CYCLE. WHILE

00:37:40.858 --> 00:37:41.959
YOU'RE PREPARING TO ANSWER THE

00:37:42.026 --> 00:37:43.227
SECOND QUESTION LET ME JUST SEE

00:37:43.294 --> 00:37:44.528
IF I COULD NOT INSURE ASK THE

00:37:44.595 --> 00:37:45.830

SAID THEY PROVIDED AT. A

00:37:47.665 --> 00:37:49.667
REVIEW- YOU FEEL IT WAS

00:37:49.734 --> 00:37:52.303
INCOMPLETE CAN YOU SPEAK ANY

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:52.803
FURTHER ENLIGHTEN US ANY

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:54.672
FURTHER ABOUT THAT. YES I CAN

00:37:54.739 --> 00:37:56.040
SO THEY DID SUBMIT

00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:58.476
DOCUMENTATION TO US. A LITTLE

00:37:58.542 --> 00:37:59.677
BIT THAT THEY CLAIM SUPPORTED

00:37:59.744 --> 00:38:01.379
THAT THEY HAD ESTABLISHED. THE

00:38:01.445 --> 00:38:02.813
PROCESSES FOR TRAINING AND

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.016
MONITORING WE DIDN'T FIND THAT

00:38:05.082 --> 00:38:07.351
TO BE. THE CASE SO NOT AT ALL

00:38:07.418 --> 00:38:09.420
CAMPUSES ANYWAY. SO SOME OF THE

00:38:09.487 --> 00:38:11.155
CAMPUSES HAVE HALF OF THE

00:38:11.222 --> 00:38:12.790
CAMPUSES THAT USE READERS. HAVE

00:38:12.857 --> 00:38:13.958
ESTABLISHED A PROFICIENCY

00:38:14.025 --> 00:38:15.526
STANDARD FOR THOSE READERS

00:38:15.593 --> 00:38:16.694
MEANING A STANDARD BY WHICH

00:38:16.761 --> 00:38:19.597
THEY NOW. THE TRAINING WORKED-

00:38:19.664 --> 00:38:20.798
IT OFTEN WHAT WE SAW DURING THE

00:38:20.865 --> 00:38:22.600
AUDIT WAS THAT. THE PART OF THE

00:38:22.667 --> 00:38:23.734
TRAINING INVOLVES REVIEWING

00:38:23.801 --> 00:38:25.469
PRACTICE APPLICATIONS AND

00:38:25.536 --> 00:38:27.038
GIVING THEM SCORES AND GETTING.

00:38:27.104 --> 00:38:28.973
PEER INPUT ON WHETHER WE ALL

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.741
SAW THIS SITUATION THE SAME WAY

00:38:30.808 --> 00:38:32.543
AND SCORED IT SIMILARLY AND

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:33.611
WHATNOT WELL THE UC NEEDS TO

00:38:33.678 --> 00:38:35.846
KNOW. YOU KNOW WELL WHAT IS

00:38:35.913 --> 00:38:37.348
PROFICIENT PERFORMANCE DURING

00:38:37.415 --> 00:38:38.649
THAT TRAINING PERIOD SUCH THAT

00:38:38.716 --> 00:38:40.651
WE TRUST YOU TO GO OUT. AND

00:38:40.718 --> 00:38:42.386
READ REAL LIFE APPLICATIONS WE

00:38:42.453 --> 00:38:43.921
BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATELY

00:38:43.988 --> 00:38:45.256
TRANSFERRED. THE TRAINING

00:38:45.322 --> 00:38:47.425
INFORMATION FROM US TO YOU THE

00:38:47.491 --> 00:38:48.793
READERS AND NOW YOU CAN REVIEW

00:38:48.859 --> 00:38:51.929
REAL APPLICATIONS. ONLY HALF OF

00:38:51.996 --> 00:38:53.664
STANDARD. AND THEN NONE OF THE

00:38:53.731 --> 00:38:55.199
CAMPUSES HAVE AN ADEQUATE

00:38:55.266 --> 00:38:57.201
MONITORING SYSTEM IN PLACE. FOR

00:38:57.268 --> 00:38:58.936
REVIEWING IN REAL TIME

00:38:59.003 --> 00:38:59.970
THROUGHOUT THE APPLICATION

00:39:00.037 --> 00:39:01.439
CYCLE TO SEE OUR READERS

00:39:01.505 --> 00:39:03.441
DEVIATING FROM WHAT WE WOULD

00:39:03.507 --> 00:39:05.309
EXPECT TO SEE. EACH CAMPUS

00:39:05.376 --> 00:39:07.545
KNOWS. THE GENERAL DISTRIBUTION

00:39:07.611 --> 00:39:09.346
OF COMPETITIVENESS THAT IT THAT

00:39:09.413 --> 00:39:10.514
IT USUALLY GETS FROM ONE YEAR

00:39:10.581 --> 00:39:12.083
TO THE NEXT. THERE MAY BE SOME

00:39:12.149 --> 00:39:13.551
SLIGHT VARIATION BUT THEY KNOW

00:39:13.617 --> 00:39:15.619
IN GENERAL APPROXIMATELY EXT

00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:17.188
PERCENT ARE GOING TO FALL INTO

00:39:17.254 --> 00:39:18.289
AN UNQUALIFIED OR LESS

00:39:18.355 --> 00:39:19.824
QUALIFIED CATEGORY.

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:21.192
APPROXIMATELY ACTS ARE GOING TO

00:39:21.258 --> 00:39:23.294
FALL INTO THIS AND THEN THIS IS

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.529
SIX THE GENERAL. PERCENTAGE

00:39:25.596 --> 00:39:26.797
5210% ARE GOING TO BE THE MOST

00:39:26.864 --> 00:39:28.733
QUALIFIED APPLICANTS. NONE OF

00:39:28.799 --> 00:39:29.767
THE CAMPUSES OF ADEQUATE

00:39:29.834 --> 00:39:31.502
PROCESSES IN PLACE THAT THEY

00:39:31.569 --> 00:39:32.203
WERE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE TO US

00:39:32.269 --> 00:39:34.238
IN APRIL. FOR CHECKING IN

00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:35.706

TRENDING. IN THESE. IN AS

00:39:40.644 --> 00:39:42.413
EXPECTED IF THEY WARRANTED AND

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.582
THAT COULD BE A SIGN. OF A

00:39:44.648 --> 00:39:45.149
COUPLE DIFFERENT THINGS BUT

00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:47.084
IT'S AT LEAST AN INTERVIEW. AN

00:39:47.151 --> 00:39:48.185
INTERVENTION POINT TO STEP IN

00:39:48.252 --> 00:39:50.020
AND SAY. DO WE THINK THAT THIS

00:39:50.087 --> 00:39:53.858
READERS PROBABLY NOT CALIBRATED

00:39:53.924 --> 00:39:54.492
WELL AND NEEDS FURTHER TRAINING

00:39:54.558 --> 00:39:55.493
IN ORDER. SUFFICIENTLY REVIEW

00:39:55.559 --> 00:39:57.228
UP AND NOW DO NOT. THE

00:39:57.294 --> 00:39:58.329
DOCUMENTATION IS SUFFICIENT

ON TRAINING AND THERE THERE'S

00:40:07.972 --> 00:40:08.939
VERY LITTLE MONITORING THAT

00:40:09.006 --> 00:40:10.074
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA CAN YOU

MONITORING ACTUALLY HAPPEN DOES

00:40:17.348 --> 00:40:19.450
HAPPEN LIVE IN THAT WHEN YOU

00:40:19.517 --> 00:40:22.453
HAVE MULTIPLE READERS. THE

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.622
SECOND READER DOES NOT. SEE

00:40:24.688 --> 00:40:27.758
THE- SCORE OF THE FIRST READER.

00:40:27.825 --> 00:40:30.194
AND THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THE

00:40:30.261 --> 00:40:32.163
READER SCORES INDEPENDENTLY IT

00:40:32.229 --> 00:40:34.265
WILL BE VERY SIMILAR. WHEN WE

00:40:34.331 --> 00:40:36.300
FIND THAT THEY ARE DISSIMILAR

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:38.269
THEY GO T A THIRD GREEN. AND

00:40:38.335 --> 00:40:39.804
THE CAMPUSES ARE MONITORING THE

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:42.273
READERS TO SEE WHY IF THERE IS

00:40:42.339 --> 00:40:46.076
AN ABUNDANCE OF CASES WHERE I

00:40:46.143 --> 00:40:49.280
AM. FOR THIRTEEN ARE DISCREPANT

00:40:49.346 --> 00:40:54.618
THEN THAT DOES READERS WILL BE-

00:40:54.685 --> 00:40:56.587
I WORKED WITH AND HAVE BEEN

00:40:56.654 --> 00:41:00.691
HAVE BEEN RE NORMED SQL AND THE

00:41:00.758 --> 00:41:03.527
NORMING PROCESS OCCURS

00:41:03.594 --> 00:41:05.196
THROUGHOUT THE READING SYSTEM.

00:41:05.262 --> 00:41:07.097
BUT THE AUDITOR CLAIMS THAT

00:41:07.164 --> 00:41:08.833
ONLY HALF OF YOUR CAMPUS IS SET

00:41:08.899 --> 00:41:13.938
STANDARDS IS THAT TRUE. NO I

00:41:14.004 --> 00:41:15.339
THINK I BELIEVE ALL THE

00:41:15.406 --> 00:41:16.707
CAMPUSES HAVE EVERY CAMPUS THAT

00:41:16.774 --> 00:41:18.175
YOU THE READER DOES HAVE

00:41:18.242 --> 00:41:21.078
STANDARDS. I BELIEVE THAT THE-

00:41:21.145 --> 00:41:22.713
WHAT WITH THE MINUTE BY THOSE

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:24.748
TWO CAMPUSES MAY NOT HAVE MET

00:41:24.815 --> 00:41:25.716
THE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THE

00:41:25.783 --> 00:41:29.353
AUDITOR WANTED AND SO DURING

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:30.921
THESE PAST. SEVERAL MONTHS

00:41:30.988 --> 00:41:31.922
WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE

00:41:31.989 --> 00:41:33.891
CAMPUSES IN ORDER TO- CLOSE THE

00:41:33.958 --> 00:41:37.361
GAP. OKAY AND THEN THE SECOND

00:41:37.428 --> 00:41:38.829
INDICATION THAT WE WILL PROVIDE

00:41:38.896 --> 00:41:40.731
ALL RIGHT IT SOUNDS LIKE- YOU

00:41:40.798 --> 00:41:41.999
FEEL YOU'VE MET IT BUT YOU

00:41:42.066 --> 00:41:42.433
HAVEN'T PROVIDED THE

00:41:42.499 --> 00:41:43.801
DOCUMENTATION TO PROVE IT TO

00:41:43.868 --> 00:41:44.802
THE AUDITOR IS SOMETHING YOU

00:41:44.869 --> 00:41:47.671
HOPE TO ON AN ONGOING BASIS

00:41:47.738 --> 00:41:48.305
COMPLETE. AT THAT TO SUM IT ALL

00:41:48.372 --> 00:41:50.374
UP THERE. OKAY YES THAT'S

00:41:50.441 --> 00:41:52.710
CORRECT. SECOND QUESTION WAS.

00:41:52.776 --> 00:41:55.546
ABOUT THE- DOCUMENTED

00:41:55.613 --> 00:41:57.615
METHODOLOGY FOR APPLICANTS

00:41:57.681 --> 00:42:00.417
SELECTION- IT SEEMS IN THE

00:42:00.484 --> 00:42:02.152
CONVERSATION TODAY THAT. IT'S

00:42:02.219 --> 00:42:03.153
NOT THAT THERE HAS TO BE A

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.889
COOKIE CUTTER THAT'S DISCLOSED

00:42:04.955 --> 00:42:06.790
AND REVEALED. BUT THERE NEEDS

00:42:06.857 --> 00:42:08.125
TO BE METHODOLOGY IN PLACE THE

00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:09.426
AUDITOR CLAIMS THAT SIX OF THE

00:42:09.493 --> 00:42:11.428
NINE CAMPUSES. DOES NOT HAVE

00:42:11.495 --> 00:42:12.997
ANY METHODOLOGY ON SELECTION

00:42:13.063 --> 00:42:15.733
AGAIN METHODOLOGY AS YOU DEFINE

00:42:15.799 --> 00:42:17.501
SO YOU SEE CAN YOU RESPOND TO

00:42:17.568 --> 00:42:20.838
THAT SPECIFICALLY. YOU SEE.

00:42:20.905 --> 00:42:22.873
YEAH WE HAVE PROVIDED THE

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.608
CAMPUS ALL PROVIDED THEIR

00:42:24.675 --> 00:42:27.044
PRINCIPLES AND VALUES ABOUT HOW

00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:28.779
THEY SELECT THEIR APPLICANTS.

00:42:28.846 --> 00:42:31.815
AND AGAIN THAT EXPECTATIONS-

00:42:31.882 --> 00:42:33.317
WAS NOT FROM THE AUDITOR'S

00:42:33.384 --> 00:42:35.452
OFFICE WAS NOT MET AND YET OUR

00:42:35.519 --> 00:42:38.355
FACULTY WHO DESIGN AND THE

00:42:38.422 --> 00:42:39.690
POLICIES FOR THEIR LOCAL

00:42:39.757 --> 00:42:42.293
CAMPUSES BELIEVE THAT THE LEVEL

00:42:42.359 --> 00:42:43.627
OF SPECIFICITY THAT WAS

00:42:43.694 --> 00:42:46.363
PROVIDED. DOES PROVIDE EIGHT

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:48.032
THE ADDAMS. AGAIN THE

00:42:48.098 --> 00:42:49.700
PRINCIPLES AND THE METHODOLOGY

00:42:49.767 --> 00:42:53.337
FOR HOW THE CAMPUSES WILL BE

00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:54.738
SELECTING THEIR STUDENT. OKAY

00:42:54.805 --> 00:42:56.407
AND MISTER HARRIS YOUR VIEW IS

00:42:56.473 --> 00:42:57.841
THAT THEY THAT WHATEVER THEY

00:42:57.908 --> 00:42:59.376
PROVIDED TO YOU DOESN'T AND SIX

00:42:59.443 --> 00:43:01.312
OF THE NINE CAMPUSES DOESN'T

00:43:01.378 --> 00:43:01.946
DEFINE A METHODOLOGY AS YOU SEE

00:43:02.012 --> 00:43:04.581
IT. THAT'S CORRECT AND I WOULD

00:43:04.648 --> 00:43:06.450
HIGHLIGHT THAT THAT MEANS THREE

00:43:06.517 --> 00:43:08.786
OF THE CAMPUSES HAVE DONE THIS

00:43:08.852 --> 00:43:10.154
TO OUR SATISFACTION TWO OF

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:12.756
THOSE. ARE VERY MATHEMATICALLY

00:43:12.823 --> 00:43:14.758
FORMULA DRIVEN BUT ONE IS NOT

00:43:14.825 --> 00:43:16.393
SO TO THE CONTENTION THAT THIS

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:17.728
IS SOMETHING THAT. WOULD RUN

00:43:17.795 --> 00:43:19.263
COUNTER TO WHAT THE UNIVERSITY

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:20.397
IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE I JUST

00:43:20.464 --> 00:43:21.932
DON'T KNOW THAT. EVEN AT SOME

00:43:21.999 --> 00:43:24.168
CAMPUSES. HAVE REVEALED THAT

00:43:24.234 --> 00:43:25.803
DURING OUR AUDIT UC SAN DIEGO

00:43:25.869 --> 00:43:27.538
HAD A METHODOLOGY THAT WE TALK

00:43:27.604 --> 00:43:28.739
ABOUT NO REPORT THAT WE FELT

00:43:28.806 --> 00:43:29.940
LIKE WAS. PRETTY GOOD

00:43:30.007 --> 00:43:31.308
METHODOLOGY IT IS ACTUALLY

00:43:31.375 --> 00:43:33.143
SINCE REGRESSED IN APRIL WHEN

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:34.345
WE DID OUR FOLLOW UP REVIEW

00:43:34.411 --> 00:43:35.879
THAT METHODOLOGY HAD DEGRADED

00:43:35.946 --> 00:43:37.781
IN DETAIL AND HAVE BEEN WATERED

00:43:37.848 --> 00:43:39.683
DOWN TO BE LESS SPECIFIC. BUT

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:40.351
THERE IS STILL ONE

00:43:40.417 --> 00:43:41.785
UNDERGRADUATE CAMPUS THAT'S NOT

00:43:41.852 --> 00:43:43.153
FORMULA BASED ON THE WAY IT

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:45.122
MAKES ITS DECISIONS. THAT

00:43:45.189 --> 00:43:46.523
PROVIDED US A METHODOLOGY IN

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:48.192
APRIL THAT WE FEEL. YOU KNOW I

00:43:48.258 --> 00:43:49.626
MET WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR

00:43:49.693 --> 00:43:50.327
WHEN WE MADE OUR

00:43:50.394 --> 00:43:52.329
RECOMMENDATIONS SO THIS IS

00:43:52.396 --> 00:43:53.564
SOMETHING THE UNIVERSITY CAN DO.

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:54.765
OKAY AND FINALLY IF I CAN

00:43:54.832 --> 00:43:55.933
APPRECIATE THE TIME TO THE

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.069
AUTHOR- YOUR BILL SIMPLY

00:43:59.136 --> 00:44:00.137

CALIFORNIANS ASIAN A SENIOR AND

00:44:01.772 --> 00:44:04.141
YOU AND I ALL I UNDERSTAND WHY

00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:06.477
YOU KNOW WE CAN'T MANDATE- AND

00:44:06.543 --> 00:44:07.611
THAT THAT'S THE FORM IN WHICH

00:44:07.678 --> 00:44:09.546
YOUR BILL HAS BEEN PRESENTED.

00:44:09.613 --> 00:44:11.115
AT IT I GUESS THE QUESTION

00:44:11.181 --> 00:44:12.483
REALLY IS BECAUSE THIS IS LIKE

00:44:12.549 --> 00:44:13.550
A FIGHT AMONG FRIENDS WE LOVE

00:44:13.617 --> 00:44:15.486
OUR UNIVERSE YOU CALIFORNIA AS

EVERYBODY PERFECT NOW I MEAN

00:44:17.254 --> 00:44:18.389
MISTAKES ARE MADE IN THEIR BIG

00:44:18.455 --> 00:44:19.757
CAMPUSES IN THEIR ADMITTING A

00:44:19.823 --> 00:44:22.026
LOT OF KIDS AND- IT IS A LITTLE

00:44:22.092 --> 00:44:23.627
BIT OF A BLACK BOX WHAT'S

00:44:23.694 --> 00:44:25.429
FRUSTRATING FOR ALL OF US- AND

00:44:25.496 --> 00:44:26.296
WE TALKED TO FRIENDS AND

00:44:26.363 --> 00:44:28.198
COMMUNITY MEMBERS ABOUT WHO

00:44:28.265 --> 00:44:28.799
GETS AND WHO DOESN'T SO IT'S A

00:44:28.866 --> 00:44:30.734
SENSITIVE POINT. IS THE REALLY

00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:31.969
DO FEEL AT THIS POINT IN TIME

00:44:32.036 --> 00:44:33.404
THE NEED FOR YOUR BILL IN YOUR

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:35.305
BILL SOMETHING REQUEST CAN WE

00:44:35.372 --> 00:44:36.807
ARE YOU KNOW A SIX MONTH LAG

00:44:36.874 --> 00:44:38.776
TIME TO ME IS NOT VERY MUCH

00:44:38.842 --> 00:44:39.410
TIME TO GET THESE ISSUES

00:44:39.476 --> 00:44:40.978
TOGETHER. I'M WONDERING IF

00:44:41.045 --> 00:44:42.379
WE'RE JUST MOVING A LITTLE BIT

00:44:42.446 --> 00:44:43.347
TOO FAST COULD YOU SPEAK TO

00:44:43.414 --> 00:44:45.749
THAT SURE- I DISAGREE THAT

00:44:45.816 --> 00:44:47.551
WE'RE MOVING TOO FAST IF YOU'LL

00:44:47.618 --> 00:44:49.887
RECALL BACK WHEN WE DID REQUEST

00:44:49.953 --> 00:44:52.389
THE AUDIT WE ACTUALLY TIMED OUR

00:44:52.456 --> 00:44:54.458
STATE AUDIT. SO THAT THE UC

00:44:54.525 --> 00:44:55.926
COULD FINISH THEIR INTERNAL

00:44:55.993 --> 00:44:57.861
AUDIT FIRST IN THE ORDER COULD

00:44:57.928 --> 00:45:00.230
REVIEW THAT INFORMATION BEFORE

00:45:00.297 --> 00:45:02.366
PROCEEDING SO THE UC'S HAVE

00:45:02.433 --> 00:45:05.102
AMPLE TIME TO FIX THE PROBLEMS

00:45:05.169 --> 00:45:06.336
OF FAIRNESS AND THEIR

00:45:06.403 --> 00:45:08.439
ADMISSIONS PROCESS. AND I THINK

00:45:08.505 --> 00:45:11.075
US AS IN OUR OVERSIGHT CAPACITY

00:45:11.141 --> 00:45:13.210
HAVE TO STEP FORWARD THE HIGH

00:45:13.277 --> 00:45:16.046
STANDARDS THAT WE EXPECT FOR

00:45:16.113 --> 00:45:17.114
SOME OF THE MOST WONDERFUL

00:45:17.181 --> 00:45:18.749
PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS OF HGHER

00:45:18.816 --> 00:45:20.884
EDUCATION IN THE WORLD. AND IT

00:45:20.951 --> 00:45:23.954
IS NOT A IT SHOULD BE WITH IN

00:45:24.021 --> 00:45:26.123
OUR OVERSIGHT FUNCTION THAT WE

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:29.326
SAY THIS STANDARD HAS NOT BEEN

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:31.361
MET THIS IS THE STANDARD OF

00:45:31.428 --> 00:45:33.297
EXPECTATION THAT WE HAVE FOR

00:45:33.363 --> 00:45:36.467
BEST PRACTICES FOR FAIRNESS. I

00:45:36.533 --> 00:45:38.335
AM A PROUD UC BERKELEY ALARM I

00:45:38.402 --> 00:45:39.903
HAVE A GIANT CALIFORNIA MY

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:42.406
OFFICE IF YOU COME IN. I WANT

00:45:42.473 --> 00:45:45.342
GENERATIONS OF CALIFORNIANS TO

00:45:45.409 --> 00:45:46.210
BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT SAME

00:45:46.276 --> 00:45:49.346
PRIDE. AND IF WE DO NOT ENSURE

00:45:49.413 --> 00:45:51.548
THE FAIRNESS IN THE ADMISSIONS

00:45:51.615 --> 00:45:54.585
PROCESS ESPECIALLY THE TRAINING

00:45:54.651 --> 00:45:58.789
OF THE REVIEWERS. IT'S THE

00:45:58.856 --> 00:45:59.389
LEAST SEXY PART OF THE ENTIRE

00:45:59.456 --> 00:46:00.824
OF. BILLS BUT IT IS THE-

00:46:00.891 --> 00:46:03.260
BECAUSE DETERMINES. WHETHER OR

00:46:03.327 --> 00:46:05.395
NOT THESE EQUALLY QUALIFIED

00:46:05.462 --> 00:46:07.097
APPLICANTS HAVE A FAIR SHOT AND

00:46:07.164 --> 00:46:09.333
ALL WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DO. IS

00:46:09.399 --> 00:46:11.268
FOLLOW OUR OWN RULES TELL US

00:46:11.335 --> 00:46:12.469
WHAT YOUR RULES ARE THEY CAN BE

00:46:12.536 --> 00:46:14.304
DIFFERENT FOR EACH CAMPUS.

00:46:14.371 --> 00:46:15.772
THAT'S NOT WE'RE NOT DICTATING

00:46:15.839 --> 00:46:17.541
ANY OF THOSE THINGS. AND AGAIN

00:46:17.608 --> 00:46:19.143
I WELCOME THE UNIVERSITY OF

00:46:19.209 --> 00:46:21.645
CALIFORNIA. TO COME BACK WITH.

00:46:21.712 --> 00:46:22.846
WHAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE THEY

00:46:22.913 --> 00:46:23.947
HAVE NOT REACHED OUT TO OUR

00:46:24.014 --> 00:46:25.883
OFFICE TO OFFER MOMENTS OF

00:46:25.949 --> 00:46:27.784
WHERE THEY CAN WORK ON THIS.

00:46:27.851 --> 00:46:29.520
BUT I WILL OFFER AGAIN THE

00:46:29.586 --> 00:46:31.255
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK

00:46:31.321 --> 00:46:32.890
WITH THEM. YOU ALL KNOW I

00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:34.825
ALWAYS MEET WITH EVERYBODY

00:46:34.892 --> 00:46:37.327
HAPPY TO DO THAT. BUT I THINK

00:46:37.394 --> 00:46:38.695
WE ARE MISSING AN OPPORTUNITY

00:46:38.762 --> 00:46:40.964
HERE. TO REALLY ENSURE AND SET

00:46:41.031 --> 00:46:43.167
THESE HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR

00:46:43.233 --> 00:46:43.901
THESE HIGH PERFORMING

00:46:43.967 --> 00:46:45.636
INSTITUTIONS. THANK YOU FOR

00:46:45.702 --> 00:46:46.670
SHARING THAT AND LET ME BE

00:46:46.737 --> 00:46:48.639
CLEAR THAT I THINK THAT THE-

00:46:48.705 --> 00:46:50.174
THE ISSUES OF THE AUDITOR REYES

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.542
ARE LEGITIMATE ISSUES AND I

00:46:51.608 --> 00:46:54.011
THINK THAT- THAT THEY SHOULD.

00:46:54.077 --> 00:46:55.846
BE RESOLVED AND I GUESS THE

00:46:55.913 --> 00:46:57.080
POINT THAT LEAVES ME A LITTLE

00:46:57.147 --> 00:46:59.616
PERPLEXES THAT I FEEL THAT. THE

00:46:59.683 --> 00:47:00.417
FEEDBACK FROM THE OF

00:47:00.484 --> 00:47:02.953
CALIFORNIA. IT SEEMS TO BE

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:03.854
RESPONSIVE ALTHOUGH NOT

00:47:03.921 --> 00:47:06.523
COMPLETE. AND- I WISH THAT WE

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:08.325
COULD GIVE THEM OF. THE TIME TO

00:47:08.392 --> 00:47:09.593
MAKE A COMPLETE AND MAKE THIS

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.295
BILL REALLY UNNECESSARY THAT'S

00:47:11.361 --> 00:47:12.462
THE DILEMMA FOR ME THANK YOU

00:47:12.529 --> 00:47:13.864
FOR TAKING THE TIME TO TOWN I

POTENTIALLY PROBLEMATIC

00:52:54.571 --> 00:52:56.840
ADMISSIONS. DECISION IS THAT

00:52:56.907 --> 00:52:58.241

THAT- YOUR BILL SITES CAN YOU

01:00:23.586 --> 01:00:24.887
SPEAK TO WHY WHY IS THIS BILL

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:26.823
NECESSARY WHEN IT SEEMS THAT

01:00:26.889 --> 01:00:27.957
THINGS ARE ON A GOOD TRACK

01:00:28.024 --> 01:00:29.759
THANK YOU FOR YOUR- ENGAGEMENT

IS. DO WE REALLY NEED THIS BILL

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:35.698
SO YES WE NEED THIS BOOK IF

THEY'RE COMPLYING THERE'S NO

01:00:36.866 --> 01:00:38.301
PROBLEM HAVING THE LEGISLATURE

01:00:38.368 --> 01:00:40.169
SAY THIS IS OUR EXPECTATION

01:00:40.236 --> 01:00:42.338
GOING FORWARD IN THE FUTURE THE

01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:43.973
REALITY IS THEY'VE HAD A YEAR

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.842
AND A HALF TO DO SOMETHING THAT

01:00:45.908 --> 01:00:47.410
LET'S JUST BE FRANK IF NOT THAT

01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:48.711
DIFFICULT IT'S NOT THAT

01:00:48.778 --> 01:00:50.246
DIFFICULT TO LET YOU KNOW TO

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:52.348
CHECK AND SEE IF THE ATHLETE

01:00:52.415 --> 01:00:57.320
THAT SUBMITTED FOR THAT PURPOSE

01:00:57.387 --> 01:00:58.888
IS. ACTUALLY PLAYING. THERE IS

01:00:58.955 --> 01:01:00.023
IF YOU DON'T A YEAR AND A HALF

01:01:00.089 --> 01:01:01.357
TO PUT THOSE POLICIES INTO

01:01:01.424 --> 01:01:03.559
PLACE. SO THE LAGGING IN THE

01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:05.261
LAGGING IN THE LACKING WITH

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:07.630
THIS. IS SHOULD BE A CONCERN TO

01:01:07.697 --> 01:01:09.665
EACH AND EVERYONE OF US. THAT

01:01:09.732 --> 01:01:11.901
WE'RE NOW HEARING THE ONLY

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:14.103
AFTER THE ORDER SAID. IT'S

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:15.772
INSUFFICIENT THAT THEY ACTUALLY

01:01:15.838 --> 01:01:18.374
MOVE AGAIN. I THINK THAT ALL.

01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:20.043
THIS ENTIRE UP AGAIN-

01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:21.878
DISCUSSION. REALLY PROVES THE

01:01:21.944 --> 01:01:23.246
POINT THAT WE NEED TO BE FOR

01:01:23.312 --> 01:01:24.614
SAYING VERY CLEARLY FROM THE

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:26.716
LEGISLATURE SIDE. THIS IS WHAT

01:01:26.783 --> 01:01:29.619
OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE. AND THEY

01:01:29.685 --> 01:01:31.921
IF THEIR INTENT IS TO FOLLOW

01:01:31.988 --> 01:01:33.990
THAT THEN THERE'S NO PROBLEM.

01:01:34.057 --> 01:01:35.658
WITH HAVING THE LEGISLATION TO

01:01:35.725 --> 01:01:36.859
THAT SETS OUT THE OVERSIGHT

01:01:36.926 --> 01:01:39.862
EXPECTATIONS. GOING FORWARD AND

01:01:39.929 --> 01:01:41.464

ELSE IS. THERE THE WE HAVE SAID

01:01:45.101 --> 01:01:47.403
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. WHAT THAT

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:50.940
THE SENATE SHOULD BE IN WITH

01:01:51.007 --> 01:01:51.574

RIGHTS- BUT THAT'S NOT A

01:05:23.519 --> 01:05:25.254
FUNDRAISING FUNCTION. IS IT THE

01:05:25.321 --> 01:05:28.024
ONLY OFFICES GENERALLY WITHIN

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:31.894
THE DEVELOPMENT- STRUCTURE.

01:05:31.961 --> 01:05:33.329

SO FORTH- THE PERCEPTION THAT-

01:05:52.148 --> 01:05:52.682
THAT WOULD CONVEY THAT THERE'S

01:05:52.748 --> 01:05:54.717
A- LAKE BETWEEN DEVELOPMENTS

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:56.485
AND INNOVATIONS. I THINK IT'S

01:05:56.552 --> 01:05:57.820
ESPECIALLY A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY

01:05:57.887 --> 01:06:00.656
WOULD BE CONCERNING ONE SO- SO

01:06:00.723 --> 01:06:02.892
HOPEFULLY AS- ONE LOOKS AT. THE

01:06:02.958 --> 01:06:04.860
POLICY THAT YOU SEE. THAT

01:06:04.927 --> 01:06:06.662
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE'RE

01:06:06.729 --> 01:06:10.266

BETWEEN THOSE TWO AREAS OF THE

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:26.515
UNIVERSITY YEAH WELL IN%

01:06:26.582 --> 01:06:27.083

ETHICALLY THAT THEY'LL BE

01:06:33.222 --> 01:06:35.758
PROBLEMATIC. AND THAT OBVIOUSLY

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:36.359

PLACE BECAUSE THAT IS

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.595
ADMISSIONS OFFICER AND LEADER

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:40.763
