PRETTY EGREGIOUS DEPARTURE. OF

THE HISTORIC TRADITIONS OF THIS

AGREED. BOTH REPUBLICAN AND

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.830
DEMOCRAT MEMBERS OF THIS HOUSE.

00:11:04.897 --> 00:11:06.832
THEY ARE A DELIBERATE ATEMPT

00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:10.669
TO CONSTRAIN THE BAIT. WITH

00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:13.806

COVERED IT'S IRRELEVANT IT IS

00:11:23.115 --> 00:11:25.618
AN EXCUSE. BUT HE'S

00:11:25.684 --> 00:11:27.953
COMPROMISING OF THE RULES. AND

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.188
IF IT IS SO IMPORTANT WHERE THE

00:11:29.255 --> 00:11:33.759
NOT NAY. THE SUNSET. THIS CALL

00:11:33.826 --> 00:11:35.394
WOULD THINK COULD END SOMETIME

00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:37.997
THIS YEAR WHY WOULD WE WANT TO

00:11:38.064 --> 00:11:39.065
OPERATE UNDER THESE RULES. WHEN

00:11:39.131 --> 00:11:43.702
THAT. FEAR IS EXTINGUISHED.

TOWARD THE END OF LAST

00:11:49.008 --> 00:11:51.577
RECESSION. LIMITING THE

00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:55.848
PARTICIPATION OF MEMBERS. EVEN

00:11:55.915 --> 00:11:57.750
CUTTING OFF THE MICROPHONES

00:11:57.817 --> 00:11:59.018

00:11:59.085 --> 00:12:01.987

00:12:04.156 --> 00:12:07.126
THE VERY EXPLICIT RESTRICTIONS

00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:09.395
ON THE BAIT. THIS IS CONFIRMED

00:12:09.462 --> 00:12:12.431

00:12:12.498 --> 00:12:15.201

WHAT ABSOLUTELY BE INFURIATED

00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:33.819
BY THIS. AND I WOULD THINK THAT

00:12:33.886 --> 00:12:35.221
THE PRESS SHOULD BE CONCERNED

00:12:35.287 --> 00:12:37.356

00:12:58.144 --> 00:13:00.012
CONSIDERED REPREHENSIBLE TO SAY

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:02.414
IT'S AN EXCUSE IF WE HAVE TOO

00:13:02.481 --> 00:13:03.182
MANY BILLS AT THE END OF

00:13:03.249 --> 00:13:05.117
SESSION THAT IS A PRODUCT OF

00:13:05.184 --> 00:13:07.987
NEGLIGENCE. OF EITHER HOUSE

00:13:08.053 --> 00:13:09.622
THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE YEAR

00:13:09.688 --> 00:13:11.590

OVER DECADES TO THAT EITHER.

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:33.312

YOU LOOK AT THESE RULES WHICH

00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:43.241
FLOW DIRECTLY FROM THE COVETING

00:20:43.308 --> 00:20:45.077
THAT WE HAD TO DO LAST YEAR

00:20:45.143 --> 00:20:47.446
THESE RULES ARE FUNDAMENTALLY

00:20:47.512 --> 00:20:48.981
ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH. AND WE HAD

00:20:49.047 --> 00:20:50.749
TO CHANGE HOW WE DID HOW WE

00:20:50.816 --> 00:20:52.284
OPERATED LAST YEAR SORT OF THE

00:20:52.351 --> 00:20:54.419
ASSEMBLY. BECAUSE OF THIS

00:20:54.486 --> 00:20:56.888
PANDEMIC. AND WE INSTITUTED A

00:20:56.955 --> 00:20:59.324
NUMBER OF NEW APPROACHES- SOME

00:20:59.391 --> 00:20:59.791
OF WHICH ARE NOW BEING

00:20:59.858 --> 00:21:02.628
CODIFIED. IN THESE RULES THESE

00:21:02.694 --> 00:21:04.329
RULES SPECIFICALLY GIVE THE

00:21:04.396 --> 00:21:07.532
PROTON THE ABILITY. TO REQUIRE

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:10.869
CERTAIN BEHAVIORS AS A MATTER

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:11.470
OF PUBLIC HEALTH LIKE WEARING

00:21:11.536 --> 00:21:14.973
MASKS. FIVE THESE ARE OUR RULES

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.109
WILL MAKE CLEAR- THAT WE HAVE

00:21:17.175 --> 00:21:18.343
FLEXIBILITY WITH COMMITTEE

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:19.945
MEMBERSHIP BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE

00:21:20.012 --> 00:21:22.214
IF A COMMITTEE CHAIR- IS NOT

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.682
ABLE TO PHYSICALLY BE HERE TO

00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:24.750
PRESIDE OVER COMMITTEE WE NEED

00:21:24.816 --> 00:21:26.184
TO BE ABLE TO PIVOT QUICKLY.

00:21:26.251 --> 00:21:27.953
THAT IS A PUBLIC HEALTH.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.888
APPROACH AND IN TERMS OF

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:31.890
LIMITING. THE AMOUNT OF TIME

00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:35.027
THAT WE CAN SPEAK THIS DOESN'T

00:21:35.093 --> 00:21:36.795
LIMIT TO BE. I CAN STILL SPEAK

00:21:36.862 --> 00:21:39.031
TO ANY BILL. BUT IT MEANS THAT

00:21:39.097 --> 00:21:40.499
YOU CAN ACCESS SPEAK FOR

00:21:40.565 --> 00:21:42.034
PERHAPS AS LONG AS YOU WANT AND

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.769
FRANKLY. ALL OF US IN THIS

00:21:43.835 --> 00:21:45.637
PROFESSION EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

00:21:45.704 --> 00:21:48.407
US. COULD PROBABLY USE

00:21:48.473 --> 00:21:50.042
SOMETIMES SELF EDITING THAT'S

00:21:50.108 --> 00:21:52.277
OF THE HUMAN NATURE WE

00:21:52.344 --> 00:21:52.844
SOMETIMES GO ON A LITTLE BIT

00:21:52.911 --> 00:21:54.746
TOO LONG. AND THE VAST MAJORITY

00:21:54.813 --> 00:21:57.349
OF THINGS YOU CAN SAY IN THREE

00:21:57.416 --> 00:21:58.750
MINUTES AND WE DON'T NEED AN

00:21:58.817 --> 00:22:01.720
EXTENDED. PERIOD OF TIME

00:22:01.787 --> 00:22:03.321
BENEFIT LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF

00:22:03.388 --> 00:22:05.724
TIME THAT WE ARE TOGETHER. AND

00:22:05.791 --> 00:22:06.825
A FOR A LITTLE MORE EFFICIENT

00:22:06.892 --> 00:22:08.960
AND HOW WE DO THE BATES WITH

00:22:09.027 --> 00:22:09.394
EVERYONE GETTING THE

00:22:09.461 --> 00:22:10.762
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. THAT'S

00:22:10.829 --> 00:22:12.364
GOOD FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH

00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:14.466
PERSPECTIVE AS WE GO THROUGH

00:22:14.533 --> 00:22:16.635
THE VERY WORST PART. OF THIS

00:22:16.702 --> 00:22:18.937
PANDEMIC. OVER EXPERIENCING NOW

00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:20.439
IS WORSE THAN ANYTHING THAT

00:22:20.505 --> 00:22:24.743
HAPPENED LAST YEAR. AND FINALLY

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.378
THIS IS DEMOCRATIC. BY LIMITING

00:22:26.445 --> 00:22:27.846
THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT PEOPLE

00:22:27.913 --> 00:22:29.581
CAN SPEAK. THAT PREVENTS

00:22:29.648 --> 00:22:32.150
FILIBUSTERING THAT PREVENTS

00:22:32.217 --> 00:22:34.019
OTHER PEOPLE FROM PARTICIPATING

00:22:34.086 --> 00:22:35.954
AND I CAN RESULT IN THE DEATH

00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:37.155
OF BILLS NOT BECAUSE OF

00:22:37.222 --> 00:22:39.558
DEMOCRACY. BUT BECAUSE SOMEONE

00:22:39.624 --> 00:22:41.927
FILIBUSTER THESE ARE GOOD RULES

00:22:41.993 --> 00:22:43.895
AND I SUPPORT THEM. THANK YOU

00:32:32.417 --> 00:32:33.151
ABLE TO PROCEED AND TO DO THE

00:32:33.217 --> 00:32:35.853
WORK TO RESPOND TO A COUPLE OF

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:39.657
COMMENTS I WOULD- I WOULD SAY A

00:32:39.724 --> 00:32:42.160
NUMBER OF THINGS ONE I TO MY

00:32:42.226 --> 00:32:44.595
COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO- THE

00:32:44.662 --> 00:32:45.663
DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS IN THE

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:48.966
REPUBLICAN CAUCUS GOT THE RULES

00:32:49.033 --> 00:32:52.470
AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME TODAY-

00:32:52.537 --> 00:32:54.572
AS WELL I WOULD DO I RESPOND TO

00:32:54.639 --> 00:32:56.708
THE TO THE GENTLEMAN AND THE

00:32:56.774 --> 00:32:59.811
DEAN. OF FROM TO HEMA AND SAY

00:32:59.877 --> 00:33:02.847
THAT IN RESEARCHING WHAT TO DO

00:33:02.914 --> 00:33:05.516
IN IN TIMES OF CRISIS AND

00:33:05.583 --> 00:33:07.285
EMERGENCY WE'VE WE'VE GOT AT

00:33:07.352 --> 00:33:09.587
LEAST FOUR EXAMPLES THAT WE

00:33:09.654 --> 00:33:12.657
WERE ABLE TO ASK FOR FROM OUR

00:33:12.724 --> 00:33:16.394
CLERK OF TIMES IN WHICH DEBATE

00:33:16.461 --> 00:33:18.096
WAS LIMITED DOES THAT MEAN WE

00:33:18.162 --> 00:33:20.898
SHOULD DO IT I JUST OUT OF HAND

00:33:20.965 --> 00:33:22.600
WITHOUT SERIOUS CONVERSATION

00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:24.902
AND DISCUSSION AND WE APPROVE

00:33:24.969 --> 00:33:26.637
THESE RULES LAST YEAR IN MARCH

00:33:26.704 --> 00:33:29.741
BECAUSE WE WERE I IN A POSITION

00:33:29.807 --> 00:33:31.242
WHERE WE HAD TO MAKE SOME

00:33:31.309 --> 00:33:33.678
DECISIONS AS A BODY AND BE ABLE

00:33:33.745 --> 00:33:35.113
TO GO HOME TO OUR DISTRICTS

00:33:35.179 --> 00:33:37.415
WHILE WE ADDRESSED WHAT TO DO.

00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:38.549
IN A PANDEMIC SOMETHING WE HAD

00:33:38.616 --> 00:33:40.418
NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS BODY HAD

00:33:40.485 --> 00:33:43.421
NOT EXPERIENCE FOR MORE THAN A-

00:33:43.488 --> 00:33:45.256
CENTURY. SO NONE OF THESE

00:33:45.323 --> 00:33:48.659
DECISIONS ARE TAKEN LIGHTLY- IN

00:33:48.726 --> 00:33:51.162
TERMS OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO- SO

00:33:51.229 --> 00:33:52.764
I WOULD SAY THERE IS PRECEDENT

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:54.232
AND IT IS PRESIDENT THAT WE

00:33:54.298 --> 00:33:56.868
SHOULD WEIGH HEAVILY. TO MY

00:33:56.934 --> 00:33:59.404

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:01.139
IT IS TRUE WE TYPICALLY TAKE UP

00:34:01.205 --> 00:34:02.874
THE RULES ON THE FIRST

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:08.045

HARD FOR TWO YEARS TO BE ABLE

00:34:19.657 --> 00:34:22.293

EMERGENCY SITUATIONS AT THE END

00:34:39.944 --> 00:34:41.979
OF SESSION TWO YEARS AGO WHERE

00:34:42.046 --> 00:34:43.347

00:34:45.183 --> 00:34:45.983
ABLE TO FINISH OUR BUSINESS

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:48.152

WITH THE CRISIS. AND THE RESULT

00:35:16.414 --> 00:35:18.349
OF THIS PANDEMIC AND CRISIS

00:35:18.416 --> 00:35:19.484
THAT'S CALLED ECONOMIC

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:20.751
UNCERTAINTY OUTLINED BY THE

ABLE TO DO THEIR WORK SAFELY.

00:36:07.198 --> 00:36:10.434
BECAUSE WE ALL VALUE DEBATE AND

00:36:23.814 --> 00:36:24.982
VERY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE IN

BELIEVE IT IS INCREDIBLY

00:37:23.507 --> 00:37:24.675
