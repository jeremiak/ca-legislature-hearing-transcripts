HI MY NAME IS MARITZA RAMOS I AM THE CHIEF FOR THE OFFICE OF BATES OVER ITS CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND THANK YOU FOR FIRST OF ALL FOR THE INVITATION TO BE ABLE TO PERCENT- AND I'M JUST GONNA GO AHEAD AND JUMP RIGHT IN AND GIVE. KIND OF BACKGROUND ON S. T. D. H. I. V. N. EIGHT CV AND- THE STATISTICS THAT BE PORTION OF IT IT'S ALL START- SO THE IMPACT OF HIV HEPATITIS C. VIRUS AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED. DISEASES IS FITTED CHAD JUST STICK AFFECTING MANY OF THE SAME VULNERABLE AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. GRADE NEXUS BURDEN AND NEGATIVE HEALTH OUT CUTS AND I'LL START OUT WITH VESTED HE SPECIFICALLY DOWN ALL THE STATISTICS THE RATES ARE WITH HAPPENED IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEN I'LL MOVE OVER TO THE DIFFERENT OTHER DIFFERENT DISEASES- THERE HAVE BEEN INCREASES IN STDS NATIONALLY BUT RATES IN CALIFORNIA EXCEED THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. CALIFORNIA STD DATA FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN CHAU CONTINUE INCREASES AT ALL THREE REPORTABLE BACTERIAL STDS. COLUMBIA THERE'S TWO HUNDRED THIRTY TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE CASES REPORTED. 56% INCREASE OVER THE TEN YEARS. HIGHER RATE SINCE REPORT BEGAN IN NINETEEN NINETY AND GONORRHEA OTHER 790-003-0090 SEVEN CASES REPORTED WITH A TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN IN PERCENT INCREASE OVER THE TEN YEARS. HIGHEST RATE SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE FOR SYPHILIS THERE'S 250-003-0040 FOUR CASES ALL STAGES REPORTED 210065% INCREASE OVER TEN YEARS HIGHEST RATE SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT. 80% ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. THE RICIN STDS IS DRIVEN BY A COMPLEX SET OF SOCIAL FACTORS THAT INCLUDE SOCIAL MEDIA DRUG USE POVERTY CONTRACEPTIVE TECHNOLOGY IN HIV PREVENTION. AS A RESULT THERE ARE IMPORTING HEALTH DISPARITIES RELATED TO STDS BY H. GEOGRAPHIC FROM. JOURNAL GRAPHICS AN INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS YOUNG PEOPLE ARE PARTIAL ARE PARTICULARLY AT RISK WITH 50% OF CASES A COMEDIENNE 30% OF CASES OF GONORRHEA DIAGNOSED AMONG PEOPLE UNDER AGE TWENTY FIVE. NEARLY 70% OF MALE EARLY SYPHILIS CASES WERE DIAGNOSED AMONG MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN. AND A LITTLE OVER ONE THIRD WERE HIV POSITIVE SYPHILIS AS ALSO INCREASE AMONG WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE. WHICH IS DRIVING IS DRAMATIC INCREASING COULD GENERAL'S FULLER. THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED TWENTY INFO BORN WITH CAN. SYPHILIS AND 889100% INCREASE FROM TWENTY TWELVE. THE RATE OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS IN CALIFORNIA IS DOUBLE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA INCREASINGLY AT RISK FOR SYPHILIS AT NEW HCV INFECTION. FROM TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY SIXTEEN THE RATES OF EARLY SYPHILIS AND HEPATITIS C. INFECTIONS AMONG WOMEN OF CHILD. BEARING AGES FIFTEEN TO FORTY FOUR YEARS REPORTED TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH INCREASE FOUR HUNDRED AND 50% AND A 148% WRIST RESPECTIVELY. DURING EARLY SYPHILIS ALSO HAD NO HEPATITIS C. COINFECTION. WOMEN WITH SYPHILIS IN KNOWN HEPATITIS C. CONFECTION WERE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT INJECTION DRUG USE EXCHANGING SEX FOR DRUGS AND HAVING A SEX PARTNER WHO USED INJECTION DRUGS COMPARED TO WOMEN WITH SYPHILIS ONLY. MOVING ON TO HIV AN ESTIMATED A HUNDRED FIFTY THREE THOUSAND PERSONS WERE LIVING WITH HIV IN CALIFORNIA AT THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN OF WHOM OF THOUSAND AND EIGHTY TWO HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED AND REPORTED TO THE OFFICE OF AIDS. BASERUNNERS CDC ALL OF OUR GREAT THEM TESTAMENT SAYS THE DISTRIBUTION OF LIVING CASES WITH RESPECT TO MOTIVATE JVMS EXPOSURE MOST SIXTY SIX POINT 9% OF CALIFORNIA IS A FINANCIAL ESTIMATED LIVING HIV CASES ARE TO. OUR DUE TO MALE TO MALE SEXUAL TRANSMISSION 14% OF THE LIVING CASES ARE DUE TO HETEROSEXUAL TRANSMISSION FIVE POINT 6% TO INJECTION DRUG USE AND SIX POINT 3% TO MALE TO MALE SEXUAL CONTACT. WITH AN INJECTION DRUG USE. THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NEW CASES REPORTED TO OFFICE OF EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AT AROUND FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE. ALTHOUGH HIV DIAGNOSIS HAVE DECLINED OVERALL JUST THIRTIES PLACED AMONG RACIAL ETHNIC GROUPS GENDER AGE AND CHANCE CATEGORY. IN TWENTY SEVEN BUT AFRICAN AMERICAN MADE UP APPROX. 6% OF CAL POP. YET THEY ACCOUNTED 417% OF CALIFORNIA'S HIV EPIDEMIC HIV RATES AMONG NEARLY DIAGNOSE BLACK AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN ARE THREE POINT NINE TIMES HIGHER THAN WHITE MEN. AMONG BLACK AFRICAN WOMEN SIX POINT SIX TIMES HIGHER THAN WHITE WOMEN. LATIN ACTS MAKE UP THE LARGEST RACIAL ETHNIC GROUP AMONG NEW HIV DIAGNOSIS ACCOUNTING 4407% OF ALL NEW HIV DIAGNOSIS AND TWENTY SEVENTY. HIV RATES AMONG NEARLY DIAGNOSE LET IN X. MEN ARE ONE POINT SEVEN TIMES HIGHER THAN WHITE MEN IN AMONG LATE IN ACTS WOMEN ONE POINT FOUR TIMES HIGHER THAN WHITE WOMEN. THE LOWEST RATES OF FIRE SUPPRESSION BY TRANSMISSION CATEGORY ARE FOR PEOPLE WHO INJECT DRUGS. REGARDLESS OF GENDER OR RACE TRACK OF PEOPLE WHO INJECT DRUGS HAVE LOWER FIRE SUPPRESSION THAN ANY OTHER TRANSMISSION GROUP OVERALL LINKAGE TO CARE. AMONG PEOPLE WHO INJECT DRUGS IS SIMILAR TO THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE WHICH SUGGESTS THAT RETENTION AND CARE MAY BE AN AREA FOR IMPROVEMENT CONTINUED SUPPORT OF SYRINGE SYRUP SERVICES PROGRAMS AND OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES ARE NEEDED TO PREVENT NEW HIV INFECTIONS AND IMPROVE HIV VIRUS OPPRESSION AMONG. PEOPLE WHO INJECT DRUGS. FOR EIGHT SAVE HCV THE RATE OF NEARLY REPORTED CHRONIC HEPATITIS C. INFECTION CALIFORNIA INCREASED 14% BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN AND EIGHTY SIX TO NINETY EIGHT PER HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION. CHRONIC HEPATITIS C. REMAIN ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY REPORTED COMMUNICATE DISEASE IN CALIFORNIA. ALTHOUGH PEOPLE BORN DURING NINETEEN FORTY FIVE TO NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE HAD THE HIGHEST RATES OF NEWLY REPORTED CHRONIC HEPATITIS C. INFECTION IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND MADE UP ALMOST HALF OF NEWLY REPORTED CASES. THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASING PROPORTION OF NEWLY REPORTED CHRONIC HEPATITIS C. CASES AMONG ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS AT OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. GEOGRAPHICALLY THE RATE OF NEARLY REPORTED CHRONIC HCV INFECTIONS WITH HIGHS IN THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA. IN CRITICS HEPATITIS C. CASES IN CALIFORNIA REPORTED FROM STATE PRISONS. AND DISPARITIES IN THE GENDER AGE RACE OR GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF CHRONIC HEPATITIS C. INFECTIONS PERSIST WHITE AFRICAN AMERICAN BLACK AND AMERICAN INDIAN ASKS ALASKAN NATIVE PERSONS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION REMAIN DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY CHRONIC HEPATITIS C. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. AMONG ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS EIGHTEEN AGES FIFTEEN TO TWENTY NINE IN CONCERT RATED IN STATE PRISONS BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE RATE OF NEARLY REPORTED CHRONIC HEPATITIS C. INFECTION INCREASED BY TWENTY TWO PERCENT. AND TWENTY SIXTEEN LEADING NECKS AND WHITE PERSON CONTINUE BE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY. YOU SEE IN THE PAPER. LEADING NEXT. 42% OF THE POPULATION AND PROVIDE STATE PRISONS THAT 50% OF REPORTED HEPATITIS C. CASES WITH RACIAL RACE ETHNICITY SPECIFIED AND WHITE. REPRESENTED 222% OF THE POPULATION STATE PRISONS BUT HEPATITIS C. CASES WITH RACE ETHNICITY SPECIFIED. SO HOW COULD THE STATE ADDRESS THESE HEALTH DISPARITIES AS PREVIOUSLY STATED HIV STDS AN ATV DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT MANY OF THE SAME POPULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA THESE POPULATIONS EXPERIENCE A MULTITUDE OF ME FROM UNSTABLE HOUSING FOOD AND THIRTY INCREASED INTERACTION. WITH THE POLICE AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EVENTS POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISCRIMINATION AND STIGMA CD PHP ARE REALIZED IF OF THESE EPIDEMICS CANNOT BE OVERCOME WITHOUT A HOLISTIC COMPREHENSIVE AND INTEGRATED RESPONSE TO THE VARIETY OF NEEDS IMPACTING THESE POPULATION. SUCH AS MANY INDIVIDUALS WOULD BENEFIT FROM AN INTEGRATED HIV S. T. D. ANY TV SERVICES AT LEAST HALF OF THE OF. MALES WHO HAVE SEX WITH MALES KNOWS WE RELEASE OF THE CALIFORNIA WOULD BENEFIT FROM HIV CARE OR PREVENTION ACTIVITIES INCLUDING LINKAGE TO HIV TESTING MEDICAL CARE NAY IV PREP SERVICES. AMONG CALIFORNIA READ BINS LIVING WITH HIV IN A CV IMPACT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. HIV COMPARED ONLY THE 2% IN CARE FOR EIGHT BE HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED TO RE ENGAGE BUT WITH H. EIGHT V. CO. TWO THE V. CAN TO THE SUCH QUESTION ABOUT IN. IN RISK TO THESE ARE. THE CALIFORNIA TO PUBLIC HOW IS AND AN ORGANIZATIONAL INTEGRATION OF THE OFFICE OF AIDS STD CONTROL BRANCH AND THE OFFICE OF VIRAL HEPATITIS PREVENTION WHICH OVERSEES OUR HEPATITIS C.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE DO AN EXCELLENT ON TIME SO NOW WILL LIKE TO- TALK ABOUT OUR TO PLEASE. INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND- THANK YOU FOR TO PRESENT IT THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS HEIDI BAUER- I'M THE LEAD PUBLIC HEALTH PHYSICIAN FOR THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES WHICH IS THE MEDICAL PROVIDER FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. WE HAVE THIRTY FIVE INSTITUTIONS STATE WIDE AND ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND PATIENTS IN THAT SYSTEM I AM VERY MUCH HONORED TO BE HERE ON THIS PANEL AND TESTIFYING TODAY- AND WE ARE PARTICULARLY EXCITED ABOUT PLAYING AN INTEGRAL ROLE IN THE PARTNERSHIP TO- ELIMINATE IT HAD SEE HIV AND STDS AND SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE PROGRAMS WE HAVE- FIRST ALL SAY THAT I THINK YOU ALL KNOW PEOPLE COMING INTO THE CORRECTIONAL SETTINGS ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO ALL THREE OF THESE TYPES OF INFECTIONS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. PRIOR TO THEIR INCARCERATION THEY FACE POVERTY HOMELESSNESS- MANY SOCIAL CHALLENGES CHALLENGES ACCESSING CARE. AND. SINCE AND SO WE RECOGNIZE AND MANY HAVE PARTICIPATED IN SURVIVAL SEX AS WELL AS COMMERCIAL SEX AND SO VERY VERY VULNERABLE POPULATION AND I'LL GIVE YOU SOME NUMBERS TO SUPPORT THAT AS WELL. WE HAVE VERY ROBUST PROGRAMS FOR SCREENING AND TREATMENT FOR ALL OF THESE INFECTIONS- WE HAVE A PROCESS WHERE WHEN FOLKS ARE INCARCERATED IN THE PRISON SYSTEM THEY COME THROUGH A RECEPTION CENTER. AND IN THAT RECEPTION CENTER THEY ARE OFFERED TESTING FOR HIV. HEPATITIS C. SYPHILIS GONORRHEA AND CHLAMYDIA OVER 90% OF PEOPLE ACCEPT THAT TESTING. AND SO WE ARE ABLE TO LINK PEOPLE TO CARE IMMEDIATELY WE HAVE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DIAGNOSED WITH SYPHILIS GONORRHEA CHLAMYDIA EVERY YEAR. AND THE VAST MAJORITY. ARE TREATED FOR THOSE INFECTIONS WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS. WE HAVE VERY FEW INCIDENT OR NEW INFECTIONS WITH STDS WELL FOLKS ARE INCARCERATED. WE DO REGULARLY PARTNER WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AS WELL AS LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS ON TREATMENT VERIFICATION FOR CASES AS WELL AS CONTACT INVESTIGATIONS AND ALSO SHARING OUR EXPERTISE IN THE FIELD. FOR H. I. V. WERE ABLE TO LINK FOLKS DIAGNOSED WITH HIV WHETHER THEIR NEWLY DIAGNOSED OR THEY'RE KNOWN TO HAVE HIV IMMEDIATELY IN THAT RECEPTION CENTER PROCESS AND SO AGAIN OVER 90% OF PEOPLE EXCEPT. SCREENING ARIZONA FIDE THEIR LINK TO CARE THROUGH A SPECIALTY HIV PROVIDER NETWORK THAT WE HAVE. AND GET INTO CARE- IMMEDIATELY IN OUR SYSTEM- WE HAVE ABOUT A THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS AT ANY GIVEN TIME WHO ARE IN CARE FOR HIV- AND ARE VIRAL SUPPRESSION RATE FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS IS ABOUT 94% AND THAT NUMBER ACTUALLY INCLUDES FOLKS WHO ARE- NEWLY WITH US HAVE BEEN WITH US FOR A FAIRLY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME- JUST COMING IN IF WE LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO'VE. BEEN WITH US FOR A YEAR THE VIRAL SUPPRESSION RATE IS 98% AND SO WE HAVE- DONE AND AMAZING JOB OF ELIMINATING SOME OF THE RACIAL ANOTHER DISPARITIES THAT YOU SEE IN THE HIV CRE CONTINUUM. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF TOOLS THAT HELP US WITH THAT TASK WE HAVE AN HIV REGISTRY THAT ALLOWS PROVIDERS AND CARE CARE GROUPS TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS- IN NEED OF SERVICES AND- HELPS. IDENTIFY PREVENTIVE SERVICES AS WELL AS A QUALITY METRICS ON A VARIETY OF CARE OUTCOMES FOR HIV POPULATION THE CONTINUITY OF CARE IS GUIDED BY OUR COMPLETE CARE MODEL AND WE HAVE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT HELPS WITH COMMUNICATION AND CONTINUITY AMONG THE PROVIDERS. THE CHALLENGE WE FACE WITH HIV IS UPON RELEASE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE PARTNERED WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO ASK THE QUESTION WHAT HAPPENS TO FOLKS WITH HIV WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED FROM PRISON. AND WHAT WE LEARNED IN THAT DATA MATCH IS THAT ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF INDIVIDUALS ARE LINKED TO CARE WITHIN THIRTY DAYS AND IF WE LOOK OUT TO A YEAR POST INCARCERATION THE VIRAL SUPPRESSION RATE IS ONLY 57% AND SO THEY GO FROM. VIRAL SUPPRESSION IN THE NINETIES WITHIN OUR SYSTEM WITHIN CARE TO BEING RELEASED AND FACING REAL CHALLENGES THAT PATIENTS FACE- GETTING LINKED TO CARE. WE HAVE SOME NEW PROGRAMS THAT WE HOPE WILL ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AND I'LL TALK ABOUT THOSE A LITTLE BIT- BUT THAT IS THAT IS A CHALLENGE THAT WE RECOGNIZE. MOVING ON TO HEPATITIS C. SINCE WE HAVE VERY MUCH SCALED UP OUR TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR HEPATITIS C. SINCE JULY FIRST TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE HAVE TREATED NEARLY FOURTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE FOR HEPATITIS C. WE HAVE. TWO THOUSAND CURRENTLY ON TREATMENT AS OF TODAY. GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF GETTING TREATED AND WE HAVE ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN THOUSAND THAT ARE STILL- IN THE PROCESS OF. PLANNING TO BE TREATED WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR SO. ONE CHALLENGE A NOTABLE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE WITH HEPATITIS C. IS THAT THE RATES OF HEPATITIS C. ARE STILL VERY HIGH IN THE COMMUNITY. AND SO AS THEY'RE COMING INTO OUR RECEPTION CENTER WE'RE SEEING ABOUT 13% OF PEOPLE AND THAT'S ABOUT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE COMING INTO OUR RECEPTION TESTING POSITIVE FOR HEPATITIS C. R. IN NAY. MEANING THEIR CHRONIC HEPATITIS C. AND THEY NEED TO BE TREATED AND SO THOSE ARE SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS THAT CONTINUE TO COME INTO OUR SYSTEM WE ARE VERY MUCH DEDICATED TO MICRO LIMITATION OF HEPATITIS C. WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. IN HOPES THAT THAT WILL DRIVE THE POTENTIAL FOR EXPOSURE DOWN AND IN THE COMMUNITY. WE ALSO HAVE- FUNDING AS OF THIS FISCAL YEAR FOR AN INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROGRAM AND THAT IS ROLLING OUT THIS MONTH WITH A NUMBER OF ASPECTS INCLUDING SCREENING AT RECEPTION CENTERS. AS WELL AS A VERY ROBUST PLAN AROUND- DISCHARGE AROUND RELEASED TO THE COMMUNITY SO TWELVE TO FIFTEEN MONTHS IN ADVANCE. FOLKS ARE IDENTIFIED IT WILL BE RELEASED A PAROLE OR TO COMMUNITY SUPERVISION AND THESE FOLKS ARE SCREENED FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND IF THEY SCREEN POSITIVE AND THEY ARE DIAGNOSED WITH THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. THEY GET INTO ONE OF THE PROGRAMS. AND AS PART OF THAT WE ARE VERY DEDICATED TO MAKING SURE THAT THEIR TRANSITION BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY IS SUPPORTED BY US AND BY THE BY THE COMMUNITY- THIS PROGRAM IS CALLED WHOLE PERSON CARE. AND THE INITIATIVE ESSENTIALLY IS TO LOOK AT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT NEEDS THAT FOLKS HAVE WHETHER IT'S HOUSING OR HEALTHCARE OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT WHATEVER IT IS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO PREPARE THEM FOR RELEASED THE- I. NOW WILL SAVE THE PART I'M TO BE SIX. THERE NEEDS TO BE ABLE HAND ON THE OTHER SIDE SO REAL WE'VE BEEN WE AT PARTNERING WITH ALL FIFTY EIGHT CAN. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO MAKE SURE THE- HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND THE PROCESS- CAN BE PUT INTO PLACE SO THAT FOLKS CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY RE INTEGRATED HAVE THEIR MEDICAL NEEDS MATT INCLUDING. IF THEY NEED ONGOING CARE FOR HIV AND OTHER CHRONIC DISEASES. AND SO HAVE A LOT OF THINGS IN THE WORK WORKS WE ARE VERY HOW AND I CLUB. WHY CITY PH AND THE OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PROGRAM- AND THAT'S BEEN A REALLY IMPORTANT PARTNERSHIP FOR US SO THANK YOU THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE AND- THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CAN WE GIVE OUR ARRIVAL PLAZA DR BAUER. REPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO ASK THE PANEL A QUESTION- AND THEY WILL OPEN UP MY COLLEAGUES ALSO IT AND ASK ANY QUESTIONS THAT SHE MAY HAVE- OTHER AND TRY TO TAKE SOME COPIOUS NOTES- A TRYING TO NOW PUT IT ALL TOGETHER. AND REGURGITATES YOU HOWEVER- MY FIRST QUESTION IS HIV. USING HIV- H. C. VI AND STDS ARE AMONG THE MOST- SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THESE EPIDEMICS IN CALIFORNIA'S RESIDENTS PARTICULARLY IN THE STATES THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE DISS TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. IT WAS A THE QUESTION HERE IF YOU OKAY HERE GOES. WITH HIV AND AIDS CV N. S. D. ARE AMONG THEM SERIOUS PUBLIC IS IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THESE AB OF THESE EPDEMICS ON CALIFORNIA'S RESIDENTS PARTICULARLY- IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE. SO WHAT IS THE IMPACT. DOT THE CITY OF STICKS BUT I'D HAVE TO HAVE SO THERE ARE MOST- IMPACT THE IT SPECIALLY FOR HIV AND STD IN EIGHT CB BUT YOU COULD SEE THE RATES ON H. I'LL START WITH AIDS HIV FIRST. AT THE RATE OF NEARLY DIAGNOSIS GOING DOWN BUT IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING- THE PEOPLE JUST THERE'S HEALTH DISPARITIES STILL SO A NOR TO. OF GET TO ZERO ON HIV WE REALLY NEED TO DO THAT LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT POPULATION SO LIKE FOR BLACK AFRICAN AMERICANS- 6% OF THAT POPULATION- IS. OF THE ACCOUNT IF SEVENTEEN PER OF THE NEW COLOR EVEN THOUGH CALIFORNIA'S OR SORRY BLACK AFRICAN AMERICANS MADE UP APPROXIMATELY 6% OF THE POPULATION THERE ACCOUNTED 417% OF THE CALIFORNIA'S OVERALL HIV EPIDEMIC SO YOU COULD SEE THERE'S A DISPERSION AT PAPA AMERICA AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE STILL AFFECTED BY HIV THE SAME THING HAPPENS WITH FLAT AN AXE YOU SEE THE RATES ARE- THE POPULATION IS GROWING AND THE NUMBERS OF LOUD NEXT WITH HIV IS ALSO GROWING AT THE RATES MIGHT NOT LOOK AS IT DISPROPORTION BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE ACTUAL NUMBERS YOU COULD SEE THE DISPERSION- OF INDIVIDUALS ARE AFFECTED BY. HIV AT THE SAME SAME YOU COULD LOOK AT- WITH STD AND I DON'T HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION- IN FRONT TO ME THAT. WHAT DO YOU NOW FOR THE IN. THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT AROUND S. T. IS PLACE. WHAT DO YOU CONSERVE THAT IN. TO THAT COULD QUESTION I IT'S PROBABLY THERE'S NOT. ANSWER TO THAT BUT IT'S PUBLIC COMPLEXITY IN A COULD BE A YOU KNOW OTHER LIFESTYLE LIKE I SAID IT COULD BE OF DRUG USE POVERTY SOME KIND OF TRAUMA THAT OCCURRED- IT IT'S HARD HOMELESSNESS IS A BIG ORDEAL IN CALIFORNIA. SO THERE'S NOT REALLY ONE AND INCIDENT UNLESS. HEIDI THAT'S ALL OF THOSE IT'S ALL THOSE YEAH THERE'S NOT ONE ANSWERED WE WISH THERE WES BUT THERE'S NOT AN EASY ANSWER WITH WHAT'S MAKING THE RICE ONE OF YOU MENTIONED MADE MENTION A REGARDING- BARRIERS TO CARE- CAN TALK ABOUT THE PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS. I'M STILL HAVING AN ISSUE WITH- HAVING ACCESS TO CARE. AND MEDICINE. I MENTION THAT BUT IN OUR POPULATION WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF BARRIERS TO CARE IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE COMMUTE FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY FACE BARRIERS TO CARE AND SO I'M NOT SURE I CAN SPEAK FOR CDC ARE ON THAT TOPIC BUT I THINK- YOU KNOW I'LL MENTION I KNOW IF IT'S IN YOUR TALKING POINTS BUT- WE USED TO HAVE VERY ROBUST AS TO THE CLINICS IN THE STATE. AND A LOT OF THOSE HAD TO SHUT DOWN OR SHUT DOWN BECAUSE RATES WERE LOW IN BECAUSE IT WAS A RECESSION AND COUNTIES HAVE REALLY STRUGGLE TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES AND I KNOW THAT CREATED- SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES ACROSS THE STATE- IN THE IN THE US TO THE WORLD- I THINK. WHAT THE BARRIERS TO CARE FOR HEPATITIS C. I'M SURE THERE'S- YEAH. PRETTY SICK. IN THE COMMUNITY STILL RIGHT. YEAH I MEAN I THINK YOU KNOW I SPOKE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT JUST THE SOCIAL THE GERMANS OF HELP THAT PEOPLE FACE AND THAT IF PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING WITH HOMELESSNESS ARE ACCESS TO FOOD YOU KNOW SOMETIMES GETTING IN TO SEE THEIR DOCTORS AND THE FIRST THING ON THE PRIORITY LIST SO CERTAINLY WITHIN AS PART MEDI CAL HEALTHIER CALIFORNIA FOR ALL PROPOSAL. WORST STARTED TO LOOK MORE BROADLY AT HOW WE CAN SUPPORT PEOPLE PARTICULARLY WITH CHRONIC ILLNESSES WHO ARE FACING SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES TO- YOU KNOW TO HELP THEM GET THE CARE THAT THEY NEED WE HAVE A QUESTION FOR MISS WALDRON. THIS IS THE A LOT OF A FOR. I KNOW MISS RAMOS WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED OFF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ANY KIND OF. TOLD ME A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE YOU MENTION ABOUT. PEOPLE WHO INJECT DRUGS. THAT ARE THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO REACH SUPPRESSION I MEAN IT'S CLEARLY WHEN THEY'RE UNDERGOING YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE- TAKING DRUGS. AT THAT POINT AND IT'S KIND OF MADE ME THINK ABOUT BECAUSE I'VE WORKED- ON OP- TASK FORCES SINCE GOING BACK. THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS WHEN I WAS A LOCAL CITY COUNCIL MEMBER AND YOU SEE THIS RISE AN OPIOID ADDICTION AND HOW THAT LEADS THEMINTO OTHER DRUGS LIKE HEROIN. THAT WAS SEEING YOU KNOW ON OUR STREETS NOW- VISIBLY PEOPLE SHOOTING UP ON THE STREETS YOU KNOW THE EFFORTS IN HARM'S REDUCTION AND THINGS LIKE THAT TO TRY TO TACKLE IT. AND IT'S- YOU KNOW ANNUAL THE HOMELESSNESS ALL OF THESE THINGS THE HOLISTIC RESPONSE OF FULL NECESSARY- AND ALL THE TRAUMA SUPPORT. YOU KNOW THE CHILD ABUSE AND- JUST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AT ALL THE THINGS THAT CAN HOLD FEET IN THAT- IT ALL COMES BACK TO. ACCESS TO TREATMENT. YOU KNOW GETTING PEOPLE INTO CARE GETTING. THAT ONE STUMBLING BLOCK THAT WE KEEP HITTING UP AGAINST BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS. I THINK ANOTHER ISSUE THOUGH IT'S ALSO STATE MANA- SPECIALLY WITH DRUG USE USERS THERE IS SOME STATE MUST STILL WHEN THEY DO GO TRY TO SEEK ACCESS TO CARE- THAT HAS TO BE OVERCOME AS WELL. BY THIS WE DID IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AHEAD A BILL TO ENCOURAGE THE MEDICAL BOARD. TO INCLUDE CONTINUING EDUCATION ON PREP AND PAP BECAUSE WE FOUND THAT SO MANY PHYSICIANS EVEN. DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. THE PER THE PATIENT IS IN FRONT OF THEM AND THEY HAVE A STAKE MONTH THERE'S JUST A LOT OF ISSUES WITH EVEN JUST THE COMMUNICATION AT THAT POINT. WHEN YOU COULD ACTUALLY. IN A START TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE. SO I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW HOW IF WE'VE SEEN ANYMORE INCREASE IN PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS EVEN BEING ABLE TO. YOU KNOW UNDERSTAND WHEN THEY CAN START TALKING ABOUT PREP AND PAT. WELL IT DEPENDS ON THE AREAS IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE HAVE WE HAVE BEEN- GOING OUT AND DOING A LOT OF TRAINING SCENES TO THE MEDICAL BOARD ON THE USE OF PREPPING PAP- WE ARE HELPING THE BOARD OF PHARMACY RIGHT NOW WITH SB ONE FIFTY NINE AND PROVIDING TRAINING FOR THE PHARMACISTS TO BE ABLE TO DISPENSE PREPPING PAP- SO WE'RE HOPING THAT THAT OUTRAGE. HELPS OUT BUT THERE ARE YOU KNOW SOME AREAS RIGHT NOW THAT ARE REALLY. NEEDING THE ASSISTANCE AND WERE TRYING TO REACH THAT. RIGHT NOW I WANT TO ALSO CONGRATULATE MY COLLEAGUES THAT BILL WAS SIGNED BY GOVERNOR BROWN INTO LAW SO THE DOCTORS WILL RECEIVE CONTINUOUS EDUCATION- IN THE SPACE OF THERE'S RESERVE OCCASION- ON ON PREPPING PAP IN THE WHOLE NINE YARDS SO WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR LEADERSHIP IN THAT SPACE SO WITH THAT BEING SAID I WANT TO THANK THIS PANEL FOR BEING HERE- AND WE'RE GOING TO TRANSITION BUT LET'S GIVE THIS PANEL. ARRIVAL FLAWS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR INFORMATION AND THE TIME. WITH US. NECK WE WANNA BY THE PATH TO DO TO DISCUSS THE COMBAT RIDE RATES WITH HEALTH C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;.&lt;/c&gt;</u> THERE. COMING UP. YEAH. SO WELCOME WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME OUT YOUR BUSY SCHEDULE ME PART OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE HEARING- THIS PANEL'S DISCUSSION WITH COMBATING- THE RISING RATES IN HEALTH CARE- INEQUALITY SO WITH THAT IF YOU CAN. WHO WANTS TO START OFF. PLEASE RIGHT AND I WILL START OFF ON MY NAME ROBIN LEARN IT I AM HERE REPRESENTING THE FIFTY FIVE SYRINGE SERVICE PROGRAMS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE HARM REDUCTION COALITION. THE BIGGEST THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IN THE ENDING THE EPIDEMICS ASK IS THE- BUDGET ASK FOR THE CLEARING HOUSE ITSELF. JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BACKGROUND IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE OFFICE OF AIDS STARTED THE SYRINGE SERVICE SYRINGE EXCHANGE SUPPLY CLEARING HOUSE THE PROVIDES ALL OF THE MATERIALS FOR SYRINGE SERVICE PROGRAMS. THINGS LIKE THE SYRINGES SHARPS CONTAINERS- ALCOHOL ALL OF THAT STUFF COMES FROM THE SYRINGE CLEARING HOUSE. THAT BUDGET WAS SET AT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN WE HAD THIRTY SEVEN SYRINGE PROGRAMS. TODAY WE HAVE FIFTY FIVE AND IT'S THE SAME THREE MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET. OKAY JUST TO GET THAT OUT THERE FIRST OF ALL NOW IN THE LAST THREE YEARS WE HAVE EXPANDED TO TEN MORE COUNTIES. OUR MOST OF THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE EXPANDED WITHIN THE COUNTIES AND WE HAVE ANOTHER SIX MORE PROGRAMS COMING ONLINE THIS YEAR. BRINGING FIVE ADDITIONAL RURAL COUNTIES NEW SYRINGE PROGRAMS. AND THAT BUDGET AGAIN IS STILL THREE MILLION DOLLARS. SO THE CLEARING HOUSE- JUST TO LET YOU KNOW PROVIDES LIKE I SAID SHARPS CONTAINERS IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST EXPENSE COMING OUT OF OUR CATALOGS. AND THAT THE DISPOSAL OF USED SHARPS IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO PAY FOR ALSO OUT OF THAT BUDGET- THEN THERE'S THE FACT NOT TEST STRIPS WHICH IS SUCH A BIG THING TODAY BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING FENTON ALL IN. ALL OF THE DRUG SUPPLIES OKAY IT'S NOT JUST OPIOIDS ANYMORE WE'RE FINDING FACT NOW IN THE COCAINE WERE FINDING FENTON ALL IN THE MATH. SO HAVING THOSE TEST STRIPS ON HAND IN ALL OF THE- SYRINGE PROGRAMS. IS A HUGE TOOL THAT PEOPLE CAN USE THEMSELVES TO KEEP THEMSELVES SAFE THEY ALSO PROVIDE THINGS LIKE STERILE WATER AND OF COURSE SYRINGES ALCOHOL AND WOUND CARE KITS FOR FOLKS SO THAT THEY CAN. MAYBE NOT HAVE TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM TO BE AS STIGMATIZED TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AT THE CLEARING HOUSE ALSO PROVIDED STARTED PROVIDING THE LOCKS ON. NOW IN THE TIME THAT WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDING THE LOCKS ON IT. IT HAS BEEN SUCH A HUGE IMPACT IN THE AMOUNT OF OVERDOSE IS REVERSED. I JUST FOR EXAMPLE IN IN THE SMALL LITTLE SYRINGE EXCHANGE THAT I WAS A PART OF HERE IN SACRAMENTO WE STARTED DISTRIBUTION IN JULY OF LAST YEAR. WE GAVE OUT CLOSE A LITTLE OVER SIX HUNDRED UNITS OF NALOXONE BETWEEN JULY AND DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. AND OF THOSE OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY WERE SELF REPORTED OVERDOSE REVERSALS. THAT'S THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FAMILIES THAT STILL HAVE A MEMBER ALIVE TODAY. JUST HERE IN SACRAMENTO. NOW THERE ARE MORE PROGRAMS THAN WE'VE EVER HAD BEFORE AS A DOCTOR RAMOS SAID WE HAVE NOW THE- FIFTY FIVE PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE MOST OF ANY STATE. AND THAT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH WE STILL HAVE PROBABLY TWENTY COUNTIES THAT DON'T HAVE ANY SYRINGE PROGRAMS. AND THOSE PEOPLE NEED SYRINGES THEY'RE DRIVING TO OTHER COUNTIES I WAS SEEING FOLKS COMING FROM AS FAR AWAY AS CHICO IN GRASS VALLEY AND READING. COMING TO SACRAMENTO TO PICK UP THEIR SUPPLIES. FRESNO SEES THE SAME THING ALL OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY GOES TO FRESNO ON WEEKENDS TO PICK UP THEIR SUPPLIES. THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF SYRINGES DISTRIBUTED BY PROGRAMS BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN HAS INCREASED BY 53% AND THAT'S STILL NOT EVEN COMING CLOSE TO THE GOLD STANDARD THE CDC RECOMMENDS OF ONE NEW SYRINGE FOR EVERY TIME SOMEBODY IN JACK'S. TO HONESTLY DO THAT JUST IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY WE WOULD HAVE TO BE DISTRIBUTING SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF FOUR MILLION SYRINGES A YEAR. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN BSS PEAS WERE ASKED IF THEY FELT LIKE THE DEMAND FOR SYRINGES WAS HIGHER ABOUT THE SAME OR LOWER COMPARED TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN. OF THE THIRTY TWO PROGRAMS THAT RESPONDED 88% SAID THE DEMAND FOR WAS HIGHER. NOW 15% REPORTED IT WAS ABOUT THE SAME AND NO PROGRAM SAID THAT IT WAS LESS. RIGHT THE JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE MORE JUST GRASSROOTS KIND OF THING IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE AGENCY I USED TO WORK AT- BEGAN SYRINGE SERVICE PROGRAMMING AND WE THAT FIRST YEAR DISTRIBUTED SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF FIFTY THOUSAND SYRINGES AND FELT REALLY GOOD AT THAT. LAST YEAR WAS OVER THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. AND THAT'S WITHOUT ANY KIND OF OUT REACH OUR ADVERTISING OR ANYTHING JUST PEOPLE WORD OF MOUTH GETTING OUT THERE. SIX FOLD INCREASE JUST IN A COUPLE OF YEARS. IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE I HAD TO REALLY PUT A CAP ON WHAT WE WERE LETTING GO OUT THE DOOR BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE. THE AMOUNT TO BACK UP TO GIVE EVERYBODY. RIGHT. WHAT LIKE I SAID A MINUTE AGO WE STARTED SUPPLYING THE LOCKS ON LAST YEAR NOW I KNOW FROM HARM REDUCTION SERVICES HERE IN SACRAMENTO IN THE FOUR YEARS THEY'VE BEEN SUPPLYING THE WALKS ON IT'S ALMOST TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT HAVE REVERSED OVERDOSES HERE CAN YOU EXPLAIN WILL LOCKS OWN NO LOCKS ON IS A OPIOID ANTAGONIST IT IS THE DRUG THAT WHEN ADMINISTERED. DURING AN OVERDOSE WILL REVERSE THE OVERDOSE. IT'S BASICALLY BLOCKS THE RECEPTOR FOR ABOUT AN HOUR OF THE OPIOID. THE COST OF A SYRINGE IS ESTIMATED TO BE AROUND SEVEN CENTS PER SYRINGE. RIGHT THAT MAKES IT THE SINGLE MOST COST EFFECTIVE HIV AND HABSI PREVENTION TOOL AVAILABLE. RIGHT IN TWENTY NINETEEN THERE WAS A STUDY IN PHILADELPHIA THE DOCUMENTED A TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLAR PER YEAR SAVINGS IN AVERTED HIV TREATMENT COSTS. NOW THAT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOESN'T EVEN TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE HABSI. TREATMENTS THAT WERE AVERTED OR THE ANY OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES THAT WAS JUST LOOKING AT HIV ALONE AND IT DIDN'T ACCOUNT FOR ANY OF THE OVERDOSES ARE THE OVERDOSE DEATHS THAT WERE AVERTED. BECAUSE OF SYRINGE PROGRAMMING. THE GROWTH IN DEMAND FOR STERILE SYRINGES IS ALSO THE MAIN DRIVER IN THE UPTAKE FOR ALL OTHER VITAL SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE IN IN FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN THERE'S BEEN- FROM FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN SORRY THERE'S BEEN A ASSETS PEAS IN CALIFORNIA. PROVIDING HIV RAPID TESTING. THERE'S ALSO BEEN A TWO HUNDRED AND 33% INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF SYRINGE PROGRAMS PROVIDING HABSI TESTING. LAST YEAR FIFTEEN MILLION YEAH LAST YEAR YOU GAVE OVER FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OVER FOUR YEARS- IN THE BUDGET TO SUPPORT STAFFING AT SS PIECE. WHICH IS AMAZING BECAUSE MOST ASSETS PEAS AND I THINK IT'S PROBABLY AROUND 60% IN THE STATE. HAVE ALL VOLUNTEER STAFF NOBODY GETS PAID THEIR- RIGHT SO THAT THIS IS A HUGE HUGE THING AND THANK YOU FOR THAT THAT IT'S GOING TO ALLOW ALL OF THEM TO HIRE TREATMENT NAVIGATORS. SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY LINK MORE PEOPLE INTO CARE AND TREATMENT- LINK THEMINTO HIV TREATMENT HABSI TREATMENT. BUT THAT MONEY CANNOT BE USED FOR SUPPLIES AT ALL. SO WHILE WE'RE HERE WE'RE ASKING THAT THE- INVESTMENT OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON GOING INTO THE CLEARING HOUS IT'S A NECESSARY THING TO ACTUALLY MAKE THAT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT YOU'VE ALREADY PUT AND MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE. RIGHT THIS THESE FUNDS TO HELP WITH CRITICAL EXPANSION OF SERVICES BUT WITHOUT THE INCREASED. CLEARING HOUSE BUDGET THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE FULL RANGE OF SUPPLIES THAT PEOPLE NEED. TOM THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A LOT OF THE OTHER. SPECIALTY SUPPLIES LIKE IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HARM REDUCTION FOR FOLKS WERE INJECTING DRUGS ONE OF THE BIGGEST TOOLS WE TALK ABOUT IS. NOT INJECTING MAYBE SMOKING. THIS YEAR THE CLEARING HOUSE ADDED SOME MORE SUPPLIES SO THAT WE CAN GIVE FOLKS SAY FOR SMOKING KITS- WHICH IS. IN THIS AGE OF FAT NOW ACTUALLY A REALLY BIG TO ALL TO HELP PEOPLE SAVE LIVES. CELL I'M JUST HERE TO ASK FOR THAT INVESTMENT THAT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO THE CLEARING HOUSE ON GOING EVERY YEAR JUST TO SHOW. THE EXPANSION THAT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN IN THIS TATE AND THAT THIS THIS IS THE BIGGEST DRIVER ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET TO ZERO AN END TO THESE EPIDEMICS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SHARING YOUR TESTIMONY WITH US- AND CERTAINLY WE KNOW THAT- THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE SPACE- THE ONE GETS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. BECAUSE WE NEED TO FILL SOME VERY SERIOUS GAPS IN FUNDING- BASED ON THE DATA THE STRONG SUGGEST THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND SO. I THINK YOU HAVE A LOT OF ADVOCATES WHO WILL BE SUPPORTING A NUMBER OF BUDGET REQUESTS- IN THAT REGARD THANK YOU. WELCOME NEXT. MALDONADO YES GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS GABRIEL MALDONADO I SERVE AS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION SERVING RIVERSIDE AND SAN BERNARDINO CULTURAL EVOLUTION- BUT I'M ALSO SPEAKING ON THE- BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO BORREGO COMMUNITY HEALTH FOUNDATION. WE ARE THE LARGEST FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH OVER TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND PATIENTS. ONE POINT THREE MILLION VISITS A YEAR- AND FOUR THOUSAND PATIENTS LIVING WITH HIV I'LL COME TO YOU AS A PERSON LIVING WITH HIV. AND SO MY LIVE NEXT. AND MUCH TIED IN CONTEXTUALIZE SOME OF THIS TO. BUT I JUST WANT OUTLINED FOR YOU ON WHICH IT'S EQUITY IN THE STATE CAL. BECAUSE IT OF. POPULATION ARE SO MY READ RIVERS STAMINA AS A- TWENTY THOUSAND SQUARE MILE. SO WHERE LARGER THAN FIVE STATES IN THE U. S. AND WE'RE THE LARGEST HER SAID JURISDICTION IN THE UNITED STATES- WHAT IS HAPPENED OVER THE LAST MANY YEARS DUE TO GENTRIFICATION COST OF LIVING. THE CHAMPIONS OF POT SHINS TRYING TO SEE GAP COST LIVING. ARE READ GROW SIGNET. IS THAT ARE UNDERSTOOD. FULLER SO. THERE'S BEEN A REAL ESTATE INVESTOR FOR A SOME OF US JUST HAVE HEALTHCARE FACILITIES WE JUST DON'T HAVE MOBILE UNITS JUST ISN'T IS A IN FIRST. FOR US TO BE TO DO SO DELAY AND BEEN EXACT SIGNET EVER THE A WHERE THIS POPULATION OF P. THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO RECEIVE CARE AND SERVICE BUT STILL HAS REALLY QUE UP WE THE RISING AMOUNT OF PATIENTS THAT WE HAVE TO SEE PARTICULARLY IN AREAS THAT ARE NOW SEEN A LARGE IN. OF NEW COMMUNITIES THAT ARE COMING INTO OUR AREAS- WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT PROVIDER SHORTAGE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- PARTICULAR AROUND AS HIV SPECIALTY- AS WE KNOW THE COST OF STUDENT LOANS EXORBITANTLY HIGH ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE OF US IN THE ROOM WITH STUDENT LOANS- AND THAT CAN CREATE A DISPARITY IN PROVIDERS THAT ARE WANTING TO. GO INTO HIV ISA SPECIALTY WHICH MAY NOT NOT BE AS ATTRACTIVE AS MAYBE BEING A PLASTIC SURGEON OUR INTERNAL MEDICINE- AND THAT IS NOT JUST WITH OUR PROVIDERS AS RELATES TO MEDICAL CARE A BIG ROLE OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS IS THAT WE'RE ALL THE CHEVY TESTERS AND THERE'S A VERY VERY VERY VERY DIFFICULT. CHORE IN BEING ABLE TO READ MEASURE BURKE FORCIBLY TEST IS ON AVERAGE WE ONLY STARTED COMING TO OUR STATE ONCE A YEAR AND USUALLY ALL FIVE PROVIDERS ARE FOR THE FIFTEENTH THAT'S TAKING UP OTHER. SO ON OUR CAN YOU BASE ORGAN IS IN CAN MAYBE GET ONE OR TWO TEST SIR TO. PER YEAR AND CAN BE DIFFICULT WE YOU'RE ONLY FOR ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE TRYING TO SERVE TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND SQUARE MILES SO WORKFORCE. HIV TESTER SHORTAGE AND MEDICAL STAFF WERE JUST REAL CHALLENGE FOR US IS NOT YEAH CAN WE YEAH PLEASE GO BACK TO THE OKAY. SAYS. CAP BACK T. ARTS. DIFFERENT PROCESS SEES FOR HOW- TESTERS BECOME CERTIFIED ON IN DIFFERENT COUNTIES I THINK SOME OF THE LARGER COUNTIES MIGHT BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THEIR CERTIFICATION PROCESS I KNOW IN PLACES LIKE RIVERSIDE AND SAN BERNARDINO WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR A CERTIFIER TO COME DOWN FROM THE STATE. AND ON AVERAGE WHICH THAT HAPPENS ONLY ONCE A YEAR. ON AND I'M SURE THEY CAN SPEAK TO WHAT THEY'RE CHALLENGES MAY BE AND BEING ABLE TO YOU KNOW SEND OUT SORT OF FIRES THROUGHOUT. THE STATE- BUT- THE COURSE REQUIRES THAT WE ONLY HAVE FIFTEEN PARTICIPANTS THAT'S THAT'S THE REQUIREMENT IS THAT THE CLASS CAN ONLY HAVE ABOUT 50% IT DEPENDS PER NUMBER OF TRAINERS RIGHT IT'S LIKE A- STUDENT TO TEACHER RATIO RIGHT- AND SO AS A RESULT WHEN YOU HAVE FOUR TO FIVE AGENCIES THAT ARE IN OUR- TO COUNTY JURISDICTION. ALL TRYING TO HAVE HIV TESTERS GET CERTIFIED MANY TIMES WERE BATTLING OVER ONE TO TWO SLOTS. MANY TIMES MAYBE THREE BECAUSE THE COUNTY THAT INCLUDES COUNTY CERTIFICATION SO EVEN THE COUNTY EMPLOYEES GET CERTIFIED IN THE SAME CERTIFICATION CLASS. THAT THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND THE CLINICS AND THEIR TESTERS TO. SO YOU GOT TO BE REAL TACTICAL AND YOU KNOW GOD FOR BID A STAFF MEMBER LEAVES IT GETS TRANSFERRED TO A DIFFERENT APARTMENT OR WANT TO GO TO A DIFFERENT AGENCY OR JUST WANTS TO LEAVE HIV. YOU HAVE TO WAIT AN ENTIRE YEAR SOMETIMES BEFORE YOU CAN GET RE CERTIFICATION SO. I'M WE HAD FIVE TESTERS AS OF LAST YEAR I ONLY HAVE TO THIS YEAR- AND THAT COULD BE A REAL CHALLENGE SO. THAT ANSWERS YOUR UESTION IT DOES WIN WE'RE HERE TO TRY TO- ADDRESSING CHALLENGES AND- THEY WE HAVE NEVER PEOPLE IN THE ROOM THAT REPRESENTS A NUMBER OF AGENCIES THAT. WE WANT TO TRY TO WORK THAT THING OUT I THINK OKAY THIS TO HEAR. THANK YOU AND THEN OBVIOUSLY I'M SURE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES THERE FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR FROM PARTS OF NOR CAL CAN YOU KNOW ECHO TRANSPORTATION AS A REAL CHALLENGE- ON AVERAGE WE SPEND FIFTY SEVEN DOLLARS ONE WAY. FOR A CLIENT TO GET TO THEIR MEDICAL POINT MA'AM YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND SQUARE MILES- I DID A RESEARCH REPORT ONCE THAT SHOW THAT CLIENTS ARE ABLE TO GET. FROM THE FENWAY INSTITUTE IN BOSTON. DOWN TO THE US HELPING US FACILITY WHICH IS LOCATED IN WASHINGTON DC. FASTER THAN YOU CAN GET FROM THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION AND SMPOERNA DINO. TO THE DESERT AIDS PROJECT IN PALM SPRINGS WHICH IS THE TWO OPPOSITE ENDS OF OUR JURISDICTION SO REALLY SOMEONE IN BOSTON CAN ACTUALLY GET DOWN. DC FASTER THAN YOU CAN GET. FROM ONE PART OF OUR COUNTY TO THE OTHER AND ON AVERAGE YOU CAN BE ABOUT A SEVEN. AT NINE OUR ABOUT US ON PRETTY GOOD BECAUSE THERE'S AN INTRICATELY TRANSPORTATION SO TRANSPORTATION IS A CHALLENGE. I'M IN LASTLY CULTURAL SPACE. ARE MY REP A COMMUNITY BASED TORT WHERE MINORITY SERVING WE- FOCUS ON THE AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATIN NEXT POPULATION- IN IN THE LAST TWELVE YEARS THAT TRUE EVOLUTION IS BANNED. A PROVIDER IN THE AREA- I HAVE SEEN TWO OTHER COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS CLOSE AND I'VE SEEN NO OTHER COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION. BE FUNDED OR CONTRACTED IN MY AREA SENSE. THERE ARE TWO AGENCIES THAT ARE WORTHY AND THAT ALREADY- BUT THE BARRIERS TO ENTRY ARE QUITE HIGH. TO BECOME A NONPROFIT- SEXUALLY YOU TO BECOME A FOR PROFIT THAN IT IS TO BE A NONPROFIT YOU KNOW START UP GRANTS AREN'T VERY. FOR OUR FIELD ARE COMMON. I'M KIND OF HAVE TO HAVE HISTORY- ALSO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS PLAY A ROLE IN RETENTION. AND QUALITY OF LIFE- AND I THINK WHAT I HAD A PRESENTATION DONE ON THE HEALTHIER CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. I HAD A PRETTY PRESENTATION ONCE. ANY IN ITS PROVEN THAT WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE ABLE TO ADDRESS OUR SOCIAL DETERMINANTS WHEN PEOPLE CAN OVERCOME THEIR- THINGS LIKE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES ARE PURE NAVIGATION OR TRANSPORTATION OR- HOUSING CASE MANAGEMENT. THAT IT INCREASES THEIR OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE AND IT INCREASES MAXIMIZES. HEALTH OUTCOMES WOULD ALSO CAN DO THOUGH IT THE COST SAVER. YOU KNOW BECAUSE IF INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT GETTING INFECTED AND WE DON'T HAVE TO CONTEND WITH THE CUTE CASES. OF HIV WE CAN REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF COMORBIDITIES AND WE CAN ALSO PREVENT HOSPITALIZATION WHICH I KNOW IS A VERY BIG PRIORITY OF OUR LOCAL MEDI CAL HEALTH PLAN. I EACH BE THE INLAND EMPIRE HEALTH PLAN. AND NOT PREVENTING HOSPITALIZATION IS A VERY BIG PRIORITY OF THEIR AREA. AND CASE MANAGEMENT NAVIGATE IN SERVICE PER. BY YOU BASED ARE. A ROLE IN THAT. I IN MY LOOK POINT CLOSE. IS THAT I'M ABOUT BY TWO YEARS IN. IN THE FIELD THAT HOW. IN IS. THE FORM. I WE SPENT A- BEING. OUT AS AN CAT. THE ANGRY. CARE FOR PEOPLE. I WE TAKING A SAN IS NOT BECAUSE IT WAS LOW THERE. BECAUSE I GOT. HAPPENING THERE TOO. GO TO AN EVENT NINE GOT STATE BUT ON THAT I GO BACK TO RIVER WAY I'VE BEEN RE READING MY CARE FOR THE TWELVE YEARS BUT MY DIAG. IT'S DIFFICULT FOR MY DAD TO BEACH AS A PRIME. METHOD PRODUCED. RESOURCE SO TO A FOR ALL THE POPPY AT SOME IN PEOPLE THAT ARE CA IN FROM DIEGO. LOS ANGELES IN OUR COUNTY THE CLASS OF LIVING IS TOO HIGH THEY'RE COMING TO OUR AIR TO SEEK AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON HOW DO WE ACCOUNT FOR THIS GROWING POPULATION THAT WE NOW HAVE TO CARE FOR AND HOW DOES OUR FUNDING PRIORITIES ALIGNED WITH THE MOVEMENT OF CARE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT'S MY FINAL MY FINAL POINT NINE I THANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CAN YOU HELP ME THANK OF ASHLEY ROW HOUSE AND ALSO GABRIEL MALDONADO. I'M SORRY. ROBIN ROBIN SKEWS ABOUT APOLOGIZE SHOULD HAD NAME PLATES OKAY ROBERT THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT PRESENTER HI HI MY NAME IS ACTUALLY THE HOUSE OKAY. WELL DO PLEASED THAT THE OKAY GOT AND I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF FRIENDS NOBODY HAS A NEED US IN FRESNO CALIFORNIA IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY I'M I REALLY APPRECIATE A LOT OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE AND I THINK I'M A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT WE WILL TALK ABOUT HIGHLY THAT CENTRALLY HAVE BEEN TOUCHED ON SO I WON'T USE TONS OF TIME. I'M BUT I REALLY DO ONE ECHO AND OR OR CENTER THE NEEDS TO ADDRESS I AND- YES COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS I'M AND WHEN WE DESIGN FUNDING STREAMS A LOT OF THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION SERVING REALLY SMALL. AND SPECIALIZED POPULATIONS LIKE THE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY I IT. I HAVE A HARD TIME ACCESSING THE FUNDS THAT WE MAKE AVAILABLE. AND BECAUSE I THE WAY THAT THE STATE REIMBURSEMENT- HAPPENS MEANS THAT OFTEN WE HAVE TO PUT MONEY UP FRONT TO ACCESS. THE RESOURCES INITIALLY- WHICH SORT OF SCREENS OUT A LOT OF SMALL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS I AM. BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE CAPITAL TO PUT FORWARD. AND I AM IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE REIMBURSEMENT TAKES A LONG TIME YEAH. HOW LONG DOES IT WAS A NORMAL WAY TIME SO DEPENDING ON THE THANK CHAIRMAN IT COULD BE AND SIX MONTHS OR SO YOU CAN OPT INTO WITH SOME CONNECTIONS YOU CAN OPT INTO MONTHLY REIMBURSEMENT SOME FUNDING STREAMS YOU CAN OPT INTO QUARTERLY- BUT THEN THE TIME LINE FOR IT SORT OF. FROM WHEN YOU SUBMIT YOUR DOCUMENTATION TO YOU GET A CHECK CAN BE ABOUT SIX TO TWELVE WEEKS I'M WHICH IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SAY US AT. THAT IS ASK. FOR EIGHTY CAME O THIRD YOU KNOW SOMETHING TO THAT AMOUNT IT IT REALLY IN THE LIMITS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SMALLER ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH I AND SOME OF OUR MOST MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. TO RESOURCE THEMSELVES SAYS BEEN OBVIOUSLY ON A BAY AREA FOR NOT A LOT OF SMALL CBO'S FROM GETTING IN THIS SPACE AND GETTING INVOLVED OR STAYING IN THIS SPACE ABSOLUTELY I HAVE A FRIEND OF MINE WHO'S EIGHTY OVER A SMALL. I'M GRASSROOTS COMMUNITY BASED ON THAT SERVICE I'M UNDOCUMENTED I AM MY GREAT FOLKS FROM CENTRAL AMERICA IT SERVING FOLKS FOUR DIFFERENT INDIGENOUS LANGUAGES AND THEY A HARD TIME ACCESS THE FOR. AND NOT ONLY THREE. PROCESS ALSO OF THAN I AM OFTENTIMES A MANDATE FOR EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES I AM THAT THEN ALSO. YOU KNOW THE EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE PROF. REQUIRES AN ACADEMIC INSTITUTION TO REVIEW YOUR MODEL IT'S NOT ONLY PRICEY BUT OFTEN THROUGH THE LENS. OF FOLKS NOT FROM YOUR COMMUNITY I. AM SO. NO RATING ELEVENTH PROP FOR INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES IS. W. TOWN MEANING WHEN THEY WERE TO TALK ABOUT THEIR MY AND HOW THEIR EFFECT. I'M AGAIN THEIRSCREEN OUT OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY TO RESOURCES IF THEY CAN EVEN GUARDED THE CAPITAL I'M TO FIND THEMSELVES WAITING FOR WHILE WAITING FOR REIMBURSEMENTS. I'M SUCH A SORT OF ONE OF THOSE GAPS THAT I'M- JUST AUTOMATICALLY SCREENS A LOT OF FOLKS OUT. I'M. I WON IT ALSO TALK ABOUT AND I AM SO GRATEFUL TO SEE IN COMMITMENTS TO CONTINUE FUNDING AS HE PREVENTION- FRESNO COUNTY IN PARTICULAR IS A HAS THE HIGHEST RATE OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS IN OUR STATE I'M WHICH IMPACTS I AM PREGNANT WOMEN AND THEN THEIR CHILDREN AT BIRTH I'M- AND. WHAT WE LOOK AT IS WHY AREN'T THESE FOLKS ACCESSING CARE RIGHT AND IT'S OFTEN I'M THAT THEN WHEN THEY DO ACCESS CARE AGAIN THE MET WITH SHAME AND STIGMA I'M- AND SO WE WANT TO REALLY REITERATE THAT IN THE NEED FOR ONGOING PROVIDER EDUCATION AND NOT JUST. CLINICIANS ARE LICENSED PROVIDERS BUT THE FOLKS WHO ARE MANAGING THE FRONT OF THE OFFICE AND THAT THE WAY IN WHICH FOLKS ARE RECEIVED INTO CARE MATTERS SIGNIFICANTLY. I AM. WE SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA HEALTH EFFECT MANDATES COMPREHENSIVE SEXUAL EDUCATION ACROSS OUR PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS I'M IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN INCLUDED MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS I'M BUT WITH OUT THAT SORT OF SYSTEM WIDE EDUCATION AND WE'RE SEEING YOUNG PEOPLE WILL RECEIVE INFORMATION BUT THEN THERE ARE THE MECHANISMS IN PLACE TO- LEAD TO ACCESS TO CARE I'M OR THEIR THEN SAT WITH SORT OF AGAIN A MESSAGE WITH THE OPPOSITE THAT REINFORCES SHAME AND STIGMA I'M ESPECIALLY AROUND GENDER GENDER IDENTITY I'M THAT. PUSHES KIDS AGAIN AWAY FROM CARE I AM WHAT WE WANT FOR FOLKS WHO KNOWS THE LINK AGAIN AND THE IMPORTANCE OF INTEGRATED CARE MODELS THAT ARE CENTERING THE WHOLE PERSON WE HAD WE HAD A LOT FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH I'M AND PRIMARY CARE VITAL MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS TO BE I'M MORE DEEPLY MARRIED I'M ESPECIALLY FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WERE MOST OF THE REFERRALS COMING I'M FOLLOWING SAY COMPARED SEXUAL EDUCATION OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH REFERRALS I'M AND WHEN PROVIDERS AREN'T AWARE OF THE MARRIAGE BETWEEN THESE TWO ISSUES- WE MISS A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES TO CALL YOUNG PEOPLE INTO INTO CARE EARLY ON. I THINK ALL OF STUFF THERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS GIVE- ASHLEY ROSS AROUND APPLAUSE THANK YOU. NICK'S A LITTLE. OKAY HI MY NAME IS MACHE I USE A THEM OR SHE HER PRONOUNCE I'M THE MANAGER OF POLICY WITH THE TRANSLATE THE NOT COALITION FOR A NATIONAL ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION AND A DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDER FOR TRANSGENDER NONCONFORMING FOLKS IN LOS ANGELES. SO THE LAST LIKE BIGGEST THIRTY IN CALIFORNIA CONDUCTED BY THE WILLIAMS IS TO CONTACT A LITTLE UNDER TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND TRANS FOLKS I'M IN CALIFORNIA BUT A LOT OF THE TIME. AND STATE WHAT CONVERSATIONS TRANS PEOPLE ARE LEFT OUT ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO HIV AND STDS AND ALL OF THE OTHER THINGS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TODAY. AND A LOT OF THIS IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE STIGMA PLACE AGAINST TRANS IN GENERAL CONFORMING FOLKS TRANSPORTS WESTERLY TRANS WOMEN OF COLOR- ARGUED BY SOCIETY AS UNEMPLOYABLE AS AND PROFESSIONAL AND HOUSE A BULL. BUT A TIME CALLED IMPOSTER IS ONLY AS SEX WORKERS- AND IN RELATION TO THIS HEARING AS A THREAT AND THE LIABILITY IS SEXUAL HEALTH. AND SO IS STARKLY THE ONLY WAYS IN WHICH TRANSIT GENERAL COMPLAINING FOLKS HAPPENING KNOWLEDGE IN REGARDS TO SOCIETY AND THE SYSTEM. HAS BEEN IT'S BEEN ADDRESSING OUR SEXUAL HEALTH. BUT EVEN THEN TRANSPOSED WITHIN THESE BIG POTS OF HIV FUNDING OR THESE STD FUNDING. ARE CONSIDERED MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN WITH WHICH FURTHER CONTRIBUTES TO THE STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION THAT WE ARE CONSTANTLY FACING. ON THE COME THIS CONFLATION AND HAVING FOLKS TRANSPORTADORA FIGHT AS MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN ONLY HAVE SPURRED OUR PROGRESS AND- AND ARE LEAVING US WHERE WE ARE TODAY IN TERMS OF OUR SOCIAL POSITION OUT IN THE WORLD. SO ONLY TO THE STATE YOU SEE POUNDS FOLKS LIVING VISIBLY AND SAFELY THAN WE EVER HAVE IN THE PAST BUT EVEN THEN WE STILL ARE VERY LIMITED LIMITED AN OCCUPATION OCCUPATIONS THAT WE CAN HAVE. AS A TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD TRANS PERSON I SEE THE FRUITS THE LABOR THAT PASTA NARRATIONS OF TRANS FOLKS. HAVE DONE IN THE REALM OF HIV AND IN BEING ABLE TO GIVE FOLKS LIKE ME A VOICE IN THE SOCIETY AND BEING ABLE TO EVEN BE HERE AND BE LISTEN TO TODAY. BUT THERE'S STILL SO MUCH THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE SO AS TI IS HABSI. HJV ARE ALL LIKE UNDOUBTEDLY REALLY HUGE ISSUES IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND A LOT OF THE TIME THE ROOT CAUSES ARE VERY APPARENT AND AS MANY PEOPLE AS THAT THE DAY ARE. REALLY ADDRESSED THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. SO A LACK OF RESOURCES LIKE HOUSING EMPLOYMENT I'M ANOTHER THESE THINGS THAT- CREATE BARRIERS TO FOLKS GETTING FINANCIAL STABILITY. AND REACHING A LEVEL OF STABILITY JUST IN GENERAL- LEADS TO THINGS LIKE DRUG GROUP DRUG USE RISKY SEXUAL BEHAVIOR FOLKS BEING PUT IN POSITIONS. WHERE MAYBE. WE'RE NOT MAKING THE SMARTEST DECISIONS WHEN IT COMES TO OUR SEXUAL HEALTH- AND A LOT OF THE TIME THAT LEADS TO US CONTRACTING A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY. SEOUL CONDOMS AND LOW LEVEL OUTREACH PROGRAMS WHICH A LOT OF THE TIME OR WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO TRANS FOLKS THOSE THINGS AREN'T SAVING OUR LIVES BUT IT'S WHAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE AND SO THEY'RE HELPING BUT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES LIKE I MENTIONED EARLIER THINGS LIKE HOUSING WELL A LONG TERM STABLE INCOME AND EMPLOYMENT WELL AND TING POLICING INCARCERATION AND ATTENTION WELL. HEALTH CARE WELL BANNING DISCRIMINATION CULTURAL TRANSFORMATION WELL BUT THEIR EARLY EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES ADDRESSING THOSE THINGS THAT I JUST MENTIONED HAVING TRANSPOSES ABOUT CONDOMS LEAVING THEM WITH CRAP BUT THEY'RE STILL HOMELESS SAID AS WELL AS TRANSPHOBIC THIS IS WHY S. TRANSOXANIA AT THE HANDS OF THE SYSTEM WHERE WE'RE TAKING BACK OUR POWER AND TRANSIT THE A COALITION AND ANNA QUESTION OF TRANSIT INNOVATIONS ACOSTA THEY ARE REALLY. TRYING TO DEMAND THE REASON IS THE WE HAVE STE HEAD START DESERVE FROM THE STAY AND SOCIETY. AND SO WE'VE CREATED A STATEWIDE BUDGET PROPOSAL ON FOR THE CREATION OF THE TRANSGENDER WELLNESS IN EQUITY FUND ACROSS SEVERAL DIFFERENT STATE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES- WHICH WOULD CREATE THIS FIND IN FIVE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS WHICH HAD FUN THINGS LIKE- NEEDS ASSESSMENTS DATA COLLECTION AND CULTURAL TRANSFORMATION CHANNING'S. IT WOULD FIND IN INVESTMENT IN MEDICAL OR MENTAL HEALTH BUT ADEQUATE FOR OUR PEOPLE PATHWAYS TO EMPLOYMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE LABOR LAWS THAT WE DO HAVE IN CALIFORNIA THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE LIKE ACTUALLY REALLY STRONG PROTECTIONS FOR TRANS FOLKS IN CALIFORNIA BUT NONE OF THAT IS ACTUALLY BEING RESPECTED AND IMPLEMENTATION. FAIR INCLUSIVE UNSTABLE HOUSING AND THEN A BIG. GAP IN A BIG POPULATION OF OUR FOLKS THAT ARE OFTEN FORGOTTEN- FOLKS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF PRISON AND PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING OUT OF IMMIGRATION INTENTION. AND SO IT'S CHANGES INVESTMENTS LIKE THESE THAT WILL REALLY LIKE ADDRESS A LOT OF THE ROOT CAUSES THAT ARE CAUSING US TO CONTRACT. I'M A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. AND SO WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK INTO THE SPECIFIC AND HOLISTIC NEEDS OF TRANS WOMEN- NOT ONLY TRANS WOMEN THOUGH TRANS MAN ON BINARY PEOPLE INTERSEX PEOPLE- AND OTHER SEXUAL AND GENDER VERY AND I TEND TO USE ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED THOSE AROUND DOCUMENTED. I'M AND OTHER BARRIERS TO CARE. AND SO FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE ALWAYS ACKNOWLEDGE TRANS FOLKS IN THE ROOM WITH SEXUAL HEALTH AND KNOW THE PROBLEMS BUT RATHER RARELY EVER TO MAKE BIG FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS. INTO FUNDING THINGS LIKE HOUSING AND THINGS THAT WILL ACTUALLY HELP FOLKS GET OFF THE STREETS AND- AND LESSEN THE CHANCES OF CONTRACTING ARMY TAVY SEE AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS. BUT BUT THAT'S NOT HAPPENING AND SO TODAY LIKE AS I MENTIONED WE'RE REALLY DOING THIS BIG STATEWIDE EFFORT TO HAVE CALIFORNIA BE A LEADER IN THE NATION AND OF BEING ABLE TO FUND PROGRAMS THAT ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO SAVE OUR LIVES AND SET THE STANDARD FOR WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO INVEST IN TRANS HEALTH AND TRANS- BEING AND LIVELIHOOD- SO I HOPE WITH THIS PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT AS TO- A MUCH NEEDED GAP WHEN IT COMES LIKE TO THE CONVERSATION TODAY BUT JUST THE CONVERSATION IN GENERAL- AROUND TRANSGENDER NONCONFORMING FOLKS SO. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MARSEILLE LEGAL. MACHE MACHE AS GIVE A ROUND OF APPLAUSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR YOUR VOTE FOR YOUR VOICE AND REPRESENTING THE TRANS COMMUNITY- IS CERTAINLY- WELCOME HERE IN THIS SPACE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT MS HERNANDEZ. YES SIR GET AFTERNOON- IT IS AN HONOR TO BE ON A PANEL WITH ALL OF YOU I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT- BEFORE I STARTED THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR BEING- FOR BEING HERE MY NAME IS KIMBERLY HERNANDEZ. I AM THEASSISTANT DIVISION DIRECTOR OF HEALTH SERVICES AT THE KERN COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT- SO I'M HERE TO SPEAK SORT OF FROM THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING- IN PARTICULAR- AFFECTING PREGNANT WOMEN WITH THE GENERAL CEPHALUS. AT CIVIL SAID YOU KNOW THE SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE AND CAN GENERAL CEPHALUS IS WHEN THIS INFECTION IS PASSED FROM MOTHER TO CHILD- CAN GENERAL SYPHILIS. THEN UP 240% OF INFANTS AFFECTED WITH CONGENITAL SYPHILIS. IT CAUSES FETAL DEMISE STILL BIRTH AND PERINATAL DEATH- AND THAT'S AN SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER MORTALITY RATE FOR A BACTERIAL INFECTION THAT CAN BE CURED WITH ANTIBIOTICS- IT IS THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF STILL WORK AFTER TWENTY WEEKS GESTATION. AND SURVIVING INFANTS MAY SUFFER FROM SEIZURES BONE DEFORMITIES BLINDNESS AND DEAFNESS AND HAVE DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS- BUT CAN GENERAL SYPHILIS IS NINETY EIGHT PERCENT. PERCENT PREVENTABLE IF THE MOTHER IS TREATED WITH ANTIBIOTICS IN A TIMELY MANNER- AND SO AS ACT DURING MOST MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND. AND EIGHTEEN THERE WERE THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE INFANTS DIAGNOSED WITH CONGENITAL SYPHILIS. AND THE PRELIMINARY DATA FROM TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IS NOT PROMISING- IT IS. VERY LIKELY TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER- SO WE ARE VERY CONCERNED BY THE- AMOUNT OF CONTENT ALL SUPPOSE WE ARE SEEING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. CALIFORNIA BE WAS ACCOUNTED 425% OF ALL THE CAN DENTAL SUPPLIES CASES IN THE NATION. I IN CURRENT IN MY COMMUNITY HISTORICALLY GENTLE SYPHILIS CASES WERE IDENTIFIED EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS THERE ARE MANY YEARS IN THE PAST TWENTY YEARS WE HAD NO CASES OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS AND THEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE THERE ARE FOUR CASES I'M AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST BY TRAINING THAT TIME. RUNNING AS TO THE NUMBERS AND WE LOOKED AT THAT AND WE SAID HEY WE'VE NEVER SEEN FOUR CASES OF MALE CIRCLES IN A SINGLE YEAR. BUT WE THOUGHT WELL MAYBE THIS IS JUST ONE OF THOSE ANOMALIES WERE IT JUST HAPPENS AN ACTUAL BACK TO ZERO OR MAYBE ONE- UNFORTUNATELY THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WITH ANOTHER FOR. AND WE SAT AROUND THE TABLE AGAIN WE SAID HEY WE'VE NEVER HAD TWO YEARS IN A ROW WITH FOUR CASES EACH. BUT WE SAID WELL LAST YEAR WAS FOUR CASES THIS YEAR'S FOUR CASES MAYBE THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL THAT WE'RE SEEING. AND THEN WE HIT TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN WE HAD EIGHTEEN. AND AT THAT TIME WE SAID UNTIL WE SAID. WE'RE IN TROUBLE- YOU KNOW WE- AT THAT POINT WE KNEW WE HAD A PROBLEM. AND THAT WE HAD TO WORK VERY QUICKLY TO TRY TO ADDRESS IT. THE FOLLOWING YEAR IS IDENTIFIED TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY THREE AND FIFTY SIX CASES- KERN COUNTY HAS THE UNFORTUNATE DISTINCTION OF HAVING ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF CATTLE SURPLUS. OF FRESNO IS ANOTHER ONE AND- JAIL SURPLUS IN PARTICULAR HAS IMPACTED THE CENTRAL VALLEY- MORE THAN. OTHER COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. I'M OFTEN ASKED AS AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST WILL WHAT HAPPENED WHAT BECAUSE CAN DENTAL SUPPOSED TO GO FROM ALMOST NOTHING- YOU KNOW TO. AND THE INTELLECTUAL REALLY SIMPLE. IF YOU LOOK AT RATES OF THE FOURTH AMONG WOMEN THEY STARTED GOING UP RUN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. AND AS THOSE RATES- SKYROCKETED WE SELL CONTENT ALSO FELIZ POP UP- SO IT'S A VERY SIMPLE ANSWER- TO VERY COMPLICATED QUESTION IS THAT AS LONG AS THERE ARE. WOMEN WITH THE FULLEST THEY WILL BE BABIES WITH SYPHILIS AND AS THAT ROUTE RATE CONTINUES TO INCREASE ACROSS THE CITY CALIFORNIA WE EXPECT TO SEE MORE BABIES BORN WITH CONGENITAL SYPHILIS. THEN KERN COUNTY- WE'VE IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF THINGS AMONG WOMEN WHO HAVE GIVEN BIRTH TO INFANTS DIAGNOSED WITH MENTAL SYPHILIS. MEDI CAL IS A PAIR OF NEARLY ALL OF THE THIS IS. ALL THE DELIVERIES IN KERN COUNTY. AND WITH THAT WE EXPECTED THAT MEDIC HOW WILL BE THE PAYER FOR ANY OF THE ASSOCIATED COMPLICATIONS THAT THESE INFANTS FACE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF MOTHER SHOW NO SIGNS OF SURPLUS AT DELIVERY AND MANY OF THEM DON'T KNOW THAT THEY WERE INFECTED AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIVES. AND THAT THAT INFECTION FROM YEARS AGO COULD AFFECT THEIR PREGNANCY AND THEIR BABY. MANY OF THE MOTHERS ARE ENTERING INTO PRENATAL CARE EITHER LATE IN THEIR IN THEIR PREGNANCY OR NOT AT ALL WE HAVE A NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO SHOW UP AT THE HOSPITAL. AND DELIVER WITH NO PRENATAL CARE. FANCIFUL IS SOMETHING THAT IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO BE TESTED AT YOUR FIRST PRENATAL VISIT AND SO WE KNOW A LOT OF THESE MOTHERS. IF THEY WOULD ENTER INTO PRENATAL CARE EARLIER WOULD BE TESTED AND HOPEFULLY HAVE TIME TO BE TREATED BEFORE- THIS INFECTION AFFECT AFFECTED THEIR BABY. A LARGE PROPORTION OF MOTHERS HAVE A HISTORY OF DRUG USE- MANY OF THEM ARE CURRENT DRUG USERS WHEN THEY DELIVER. MORE AND MORE OF THEM ARE BEING AFFECTED BY HOMELESSNESS. AND A LOT OF THESE INFANTS ARE ENDING UP IN FOSTER CARE. THAT'S WHAT WE SEE JUSTIN KERN COUNTY- AND I IMAGINE IT'S VERY SIMILAR ACROSS THE STATE. IN CURRENT COUNTY WE HAVE BEEN DEDICATING RESOURCES SPECIFICALLY. SPECIFICALLY TO SUPPOSING DENTAL SUPPLIES FOR THE BETTER PART OF FOUR YEARS I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH INCREDIBLE PEOPLE WHO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND TO SUPPORT PREGNANT WOMEN. AND THEIR BABIES. IN A TIME WHEN MANY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO CLOSE THEIR CLINICS ARE CLINICIANS. WILL DO ALMOST ANYTHING TO MAKE SURE THAT A PREGNANT WOMAN WITH THE FELIZ CAN BE SEEN RIGHT AWAY. SKIP LUNCH THEY STAY LATE- THEY WORK EXTRA HARD BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THESE WOMEN- WHEN THEY PRESENT TO US NEED TO BE SEEN NOW BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT COME BACK I ALSO WORK WITH. AN AMAZING TEAM OF MEDICAL INVESTIGATORS WHO LITERALLY CLIMB OVER FENCES TO FIND PEOPLE. AND TO HELP THAT GET THEM TO TREATMENT. WE HAVE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES WHO FOLLOW WOMEN THROUGHOUT THEIR PREGNANCY AND BEYONDTO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE HEALTHIEST OUTCOME THAT THEY CAN. AND WE HAVE AMAZING COMMUNITY PARTNERS WHO ENSURE THAT MOMS AND BABIES I'M RECEIVE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT. IN CURRENT COUNTY WE ALSO HAVE SOME SPECIAL RESOURCES THAT FEW OTHER COUNTIES HAVE- WE ARE FORTUNATE THAT E HAVE- SEE PEEKS DISEASE INTERVENTION SPECIALIST WHO SPECIALIZE IN SYPHILIS. IN OUR BUILDING THEY WERE THE BACKBONE OF CREATING OUR PROGRAM TODAY AND MENTORING AND TEACHING- OUR STAFF TO BE ABLE TO FIND AND- INITIATE CONTACT AND GET PEOPLE TO TREATMENT. AND THEY CONTINUE THE STATE HELP US FIND THOSE PATIENTS AND GET THEM IN A TREATMENT. WE ALSO HAVE OUR THE RECIPIENT- OF SHORT TERM FUNDING THAT'S DEDICATED TO ADDRESSING GENERAL CEPHALUS- AND WITH THAT COMES ENORMOUS SUPPORT FROM OUR COLLEAGUES OF THE CALIFORNIA PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND YET EVEN WITH ALL OF THAT. WE ARE ONLY STILL REACTING TO THE CAN DENTAL SURPLUS IN OUR COMMUNITY. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE EPIDEMIC OF CANALS OF LISTEN KERN COUNTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE WILL HAVE TO AND THE LARGE EPIDEMIC OF SYPHILIS. WE KNOW THAT THESE BABIES ARE GETTING IT FROM THEIR MOMS THEIR MOMS ARE GETTING FROM THEIR PARTNERS AND AS LONG AS SUPPOSED CONTINUE TO CIRCULATE MY COMMUNITY WE'LL HAVE BABIES BORN WITH IT. AS WE SEE THE RATES OF HIV AND HEPATITIS C. AMONG WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE INCREASE. ON A DOCTOR MUST MENTIONED EARLIER. WE'RE WATCHING YOU KNOW HOLDING OUR BREATH REALLY TO SEE. WHEN WE START GETTING INFANTS BORN WITH HIV AGAIN. WHEN WE START GETTING INFANTS BORN WITH HEPATITIS C. AGAIN- IT HAPPENED IN THE PAST AND- WE ARE HOPEFUL WE WILL BE ABLE TO STAVE IT OFF BUT WE KNOW THE REALITY IS. AS THESE ARE. RATES INCREASING IN WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE AND IN PARTICULAR IN PREGNANT WOMEN WE'RE GOING TO SEE INFANTS AFFECTED. ACROSS THE STATE THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE WORKING AS HARD AS THEY CAN WITH THE LIMITED RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE. INFECTIOUS DISEASES HAVE NEVER STOPPED I COUNTY BORDERS AND WE KNOW WE WILL ALL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER IN ORDER TO. PROTECT OUR MOST NOTABLE POPULATIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU ALL ON THE PANEL FOR EVERYTHING YOU GUYS DO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CAN GIVE MS HERNANDEZ AROUND APPLAUSE. I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN AS YOU YOU ALL BROUGHT SO MUCH INFORMATION TO BEAR I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AND DR NHà AND DR ANDERS. OKAY MS HERNANDEZ TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW THE- INFANTS BORING- WITH- SURPLUS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE- I DON'T THINK PEOPLE UNDERSTAND SO THE REASON WHY I'M IN THIS SPACE AND I THINK IT'S- GOING TO PUT IN SOME CONTEXTS. MY GOD SON- WHO- MOTHER FATHER BOTH DIED OF AIDS. WE GREW U IN THE CHURCH TOGETHER. AND THAT THEY CONNECTED AND THAT THEY BROUGHT A CHILD INTO THIS WORLD- HE LOST BOTH MOTHER FATHER AT SIX YEARS OLD. LOS MOM AND DAD AT SIX YEARS AGO. AND THE BIOLOGICAL GRANDPARENTS NEVER GOT HIM THE TROUT THE HELP THAT HE NEEDED TO THE TRAUMA LOSING BOTH PARENTS AND SO MY CHILD IS NOW IN CRYSTAL METH AND HE'S HOMELESS. AND YOU KNOW FOR ME- YOU KNOW WHEN I FLY BACK TO LOS ANGELES ONLY DO I TAKE CARE OF MY CONSTITUENTS- SO HE WAS HE WAS DIAGNOSED AFTER BEING TREATED- PERIODICALLY TO MAKE SURE HE WAS NOT HIV POSITIVE- THAT ARE GOING TO CRACK HOUSES. AND PULL THEM OUT. AND BRING THEM HOME AND CLEAN HIM UP AND THEN HE WANTS TO GO AND LEAVE AGAIN ANY CHECKS ITSELF OUT OF PROGRAMS SO I SEE A DIRECT LINK. TO ALL OF THIS- IN A VERY SYSTEMATIC WAY AND SO I'M IN THIS SPACE- BECAUSE THE FIGHT IS IN THIS SPACE. I'M IN THIS SPACE TO MAKING SURE THAT RESOURCES ARE GIVEN TO TRY TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE AFFECTED- BY STDS HIV ANNEX OUT- SO THAT'S WHY I'M IN THIS SPACE. AND SO LET IT BE KNOWN THAT ALL DOUBT BE CAST ASIDE. THAT'S MY MOTIVATION FOR BEING IN THE SPACE ONLY UNDER THAN WE CAN TO REDUCE THE NUMBERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO WE THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. ON THIS GIVE THIS PANEL ONE MORE ROUND OF APPLAUSE PLEASE. AS THEY TRANSITION. WE'LL BE ASKING QUESTIONS CELLS- SO BE CLOSE WE WANT TO BRING UP THE NEXT PANEL IF YOU WOULD PLEASE. WE WANT TO BRING UP THE NEXT- KEY STRATEGIES IN THE EPIDEMIC TO PLEASE- THAT PARA PLEASE COME UP AND- TAKE YOUR PLACES. IN FRONT. WE'LL START OFF WITH WAYNE STEWART CALIFORNIA HIV AND AIDS POLICY RESEARCH CENTER. AND THEN THE TRANSITION CLINIC NETWORK WILL FOLLOW AND THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DIVISION ON HIV AND STD PROGRAMS AND THE FAMILY HEALTH CENTER OF SAN DIEGO. AND THEN ESSENTIAL ACCESS TO HEALTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE EACH OF EACH OF YOU COMING GIVEN EVER TIME ONCE AGAIN- WE WILL OPEN UP INTRODUCTIONS AND PRESENTATIONS WE'RE WE'RE GOOD WITH BEING VERY LIBERAL IN TERMS OF TIME SO WEDNESDAY ABOUT TEN FIFTEEN MINUTES IF YOU WOULD PLEASE AND YOU'RE WELCOME RIGHT THANK YOU SO I AM WHEN STEWART I'M A PROFESSOR AT THE UCSF CENTER FOR AIDS PREVENTION STUDIES. AND AS YOU ALLUDED TO IN YOUR REMARKS AS YOUR OPENING THIS I AM ONE OF ONE OF SEVERAL PRICIPAL INVESTIGATORS FOR THE CALIFORNIA HIV POLICY RESEARCH CENTERS WHICH IS FUNDED BY THE CALIFORNIA HIV AIDS RESEARCH PROGRAM IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM SO I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THE REMARKS AS THEY'VE BEEN GOING AND I'VE BEEN JOTTING DOWN THINGS AND KIND OF RE SHUFFLING WHAT I WANNA SAY WHICH MAY BE A LITTLE DANGEROUS AN ACADEMIC OFF SCRIPT BUT- BUT- IN LISTENING TO HURT TO THE CONVERSATION AS IT'S GONE THUS FAR THIS AFTERNOON- I THINK THERE'S REALLY. TO KIND OF COMPETING FORCES THAT SHAPE. WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT STRATEGIES TO RESPOND TO ENDING THESE EPIDEMICS- ONE OF THEM THAT IS DEFINITELY. BEEN PREVALENT IN MANY OF THE CONVERSATIONS IS THIS ISSUE OF LAYERS OF VULNERABILITY. RIGHT I MEAN YOU CAN THINK OF THEM AS A VENN DIAGRAM OF OVERLAPPING CIRCLES- BUT- WE AS A GENERAL RULE WHEN YOU LOOK ACROSS THE DIFFERENT CONDITIONS AND YOU LOOK ACROSS WHAT DISPARITIES LOOK LIKE YOU TRY TO SAY. THE WHAT'S THE PATTERN AND HOW DO WE EXPLAIN THE PATTERN. BUT WE GENERALLY DO BETTER. WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO HELP SOMEBODY WHO HAS FEWER LAYERS OF VULNERABILITY SO IF YOU'RE ONLY ISSUE. IS THAT YOU ARE AT RISK FOR HIV AND YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE OTHER BIG ISSUES THAT YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH. WE'RE NOT PERFECT AT IT BUT WE DO OKAY AT HELPING THAT PERSON TO REDUCE RISK BUT IF THAT IF THAT SAME PERSON NOT ONLY IS AT RISK FOR HIV BUT IS ALSO AT RISK FOR HCV AN S. T. D.'S XANDER HOMELESS. AND THEY MIGHT HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO GET THEIR NEXT MEAL. AND YOU KNOW THEY HAD ABUSE OR THINGS LIKE THAT WE- ARE FAR LESS LIKELY TO BE SUCCESSFUL. RIGHT AND THAT'S JUST BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE THIS HIERARCHY OF NEEDS IN THIS KIND OF THE LAYER. OF ISSUES THAT THE PERSON HAS TO DEAL WITH. THEM AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT A RESPONSE. IS THAT YOU HAVE TO BREAK DOWN AND SORT OF CUT ACROSS HAVE BEEN VERY TO. IN TERMS OF THE WAY THAT WE STEP UP OUR SYSTEM IS IN THE WAY THAT IT'S SET UP SERVICE. RIGHT SO THERE'S DIVISIONS BY DISEASE. RIGHT AND PART OF WHAT BROUGHT US HERE TODAY IS THIS IDEA THAT. WE WOULD DO BETTER NOT TO JUST THINK OF HIV AS H. A. B. SERVICES AN H. C. B. OVER HERE AND STDS OVER HERE. BUT TO BRING THEM TOGETHER AND THINK ABOUT AND- PLAN. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO. A HEALTH SERVE. AND THEN THINGS ARE NOT TREATED HELD SERVICE SO HOMELESSNESS. IS A HUGE VULNERABILITY IT'S- VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND SAN FRANCISCO FOR EXAMPLE WHERE I COME FROM RIGHT I MEAN. WE HAVE ALL THE SUCCESSES SAN FRANCISCO GETS HERALDED FOR IT'S GETTING TWO ZERO PLAN AND IT'S ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVEN NEW INFECTIONS WHATEVER ELSE AND THEN YOU FLIP THROUGH THE ANNUAL. EPIDEMIOLOGY REPORT AND YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS FOR HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. AND IT'S A FAR LESS ROSY PICTURE I MEAN IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE BLEAK IN TERMS OF HOW WELL WE'RE DOING. SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SOLVE. THE PROBLEM. OF YOU KNOW A PERSON WHO'S HOMELESS IT IS IN IN CARE YOU'RE NOT GONNA STRICTLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM BY THINKING WELL WE'LL JUS HAVE MORE CARE. WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS WHICH IS NOT. IN THE REALM OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WE TRADITIONALLY DEAL WITH THAT. SO WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE CUT ACROSS THOSE DIVISIONS AND- AND YOU KNOW AS AS STAKEHOLDERS WHO RECEIVE MONEY OF COURSE. WE CAN TRY TO DO THAT BUT SOME OF THE BARRIERS ALSO COME FROM FUNDING STREAMS AND FROM THE WAY THAT. THE PEOPLE IN YOUR POSITIONS RIGHT. LONG SET THINGS UP FOR VERY GOOD REASONS THE WAY WE STRUCTURE TO THINGS- FROM LONG AGO IN TERMS OF HOW WE THINK ABOUT. WHO'S RESPONSIBLE ONE WHAT SELECT COMMITTEE WHAT WHAT WHAT FUNDING STREAM WHAT PART OF THE BUDGET TO SOMETHING COME THROUGH THESE ARE THESE ARE ISSUES WE HAVE TO TACKLE TO TRY TO. TO BREAK DOWN THOSE BARRIERS. THE COMPETING FOR THE IS ALSO GOING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LAYERS OF OWNER BILLY SOME TALKING ABOUT LAYERS OF VULNERABILITY AND ACTUALLY. ASKING US TO EXPAND WHAT WE WERE THINKING OF AS AS SERVICES AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO. THE COMPETING FORCE IS THIS ONE OF CAPACITY- IN ITS ANOTHER THING THAT HAS HAS BEEN REFLECTED IN THE LOT OF THE COMMENTS THAT I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO TODAY- AND- IS THAT IS. IT'S NOT THAT WE ARE NOT TRYING TO DO THINGS FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE AND INDIVIDUALS I DO A LOT OF RESEARCH IN IN CLINICS- I'M NOT A CLINICIAN MYSELF SO I COME IN WITH THIS SORT OF. OUTSIDER LANDS WHEN I WHEN I DO SO AND WHENEVER I GO IN THERE IF I MEAN IF I THINK AS A PROFESSOR THAT I HAVE A LOT OF DEMANDS ON MY TIME I LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE CLINICS AND I'M LIKE. I DON'T REALLY HAVE A LOT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT RIGHT I MEAN THE SHEER NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ARE CLINICS HAVE TO DEAL WITH JUST TO ADMINISTER CARE TO THE MOST VULNERABLE OF INDIVIDUALS. IS REALLY QUITE REMARKABLE I MEAN NOT ONLY ARE THERE ALL THE ISSUES WITH INSURANCE THAT YOU HAVE TO STRAIGHTEN OUT BUT YOU'LL HAVE THINGS LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TO REFER PEOPLE TO ALL SORTS OF SERVICES. THEY IT'S VERY COMMON TO FIND THAT YOU'RE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WILL HAVE ISSUES OF SOCIAL ISOLATION SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY LEANING ON THEIR PROVIDERS TO BE THEIR SOURCE OF SOCIAL SUPPORT WHICH IS WELL OUTSIDE THE BOUNDS OF WHAT WE WOULD TRADITIONALLY THINK OF AS AS WHAT THE PROVIDERS RESPONSIBILITY IS. IN SO AGAINST THAT BACKDROP WERE NOW SAYING WE'VE GOT ALL THESE DISH ISSUES WE NEED TO DEAL WITH AND SO. THERE'S THIS ROOM OF HOW DO WE HOW DO WE MAKE IT HAPPEN AND RECOGNIZE THAT WE ALREADY. IMPOSE A LOT ON OUR CLINICS. AND WE CAN'T JUST SIMPLY ASK FOR MORE WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE EITHER BOLSTER. THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ITSELF FOR RESTRUCTURED IN SOME WAY TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO DELIVER THOSE EXTRA SERVICES SO THERE'S A QUESTION. EARLIER AS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS EIGHT THINK- MEMBER WALDRON YOU ASKED ABOUT CRAP. SO I'VE BEEN ON A STUDY IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT'S TRYING TO DO PREP AND IT'S IN THAT THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS THERE AND- WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT PROVIDERS IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE- DON'T SUPPORT THE GOAL. IT'S NOT THAT THEY ARE AFRAID OF HAVING THE CONVERSATION IT'S THAT THEY ARE SO BUSY. THAT THEY ARE HAVING TO DO THE CALCULUS OF IF I IF I INTRODUCED PREP TO THE PATIENT IN FRONT OF ME I KNOW HOW TO FOLLOW UP WITH THAT PATIENT EVERY FEW MONTHS I HAVE. THIS ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY THAT GOES BEYOND KIND OF WHAT MY NORMAL ROUTINE IS AND IT'S AN EXTRA SOMETHING SO THE WAY WE'VE EFFECTIVELY DEALT WITH IT IS TO PUT PROP COORDINATORS IN PLACE PEOPLE WHO. ARE OFF LOADING- SOME OF THAT WORK FOR THE PROVIDERS SAID THAT THEY'RE NOT CONCERNED ABOUT ABOUT THESE KINDS OF. PASSING THE ISSUES- MORE GENERAL LATER ALSO QUESTIONS THAT COME UP THEIR SORT OF INCAPACITY THEY'RE STILL QUESTIONS THAT COME UP. CLINICS CONSTANTLY HAVE TO LOOK AT IN ASK THEMSELVES THE QUESTION OF WHO. IS PAYING FOR WHAT. IN AS WE DIVERSIFY THE KINDS OF SERVICES WERE THINKING ABOUT NOT EVERY FUNDING STREAM WILL NECESSARILY FIND. EVERY KIND SIR AND SO YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. IS THERE A FIT. THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW A CLINIC TO PICK UP IN ADDRESS SOMETHING LIKE A TYPE OF VULNERABILITY THAT HASN'T BEEN DEALT WITH BEFORE AND IS THERE GOING TO BE A WAY TO PAY FOR IT AND IN THE- IN THE QUESTION THE ANSWER TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE WILL BE A WAY TO PAY FOR IT. IS A TOTALLY DISSATISFIED IT DEPENDS BECAUSE IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE SERVICE AND IT DEPENDS ON THE KINDS OF A FUNDING STREAMS THAT PARTICULAR FACILITY HAS AVAILABLE. FROM ANOTHER ISSUE BECOMES A WHO IS ABLE TO DO WHAT- SO SOMETIMES YOU JUST SIMPLY DON'T HAVE POSITIONS THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE IN ORDER TO EXPAND YOUR SERVICES AND SOMETIMES. THEY'RE ISSUES AROUND THINGS LIKE LICENSING- THAT AFFECT WHAT A PERSON CAN DO. AND THEN THE THIRD THING IN THIS MAY BE MORE TRUE IN I'VE SEEN THIS BE MORE TRUE AS A CONCERN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND I HAVE HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL. IS ONE OF TIMELINE SO IF WE ARE TRYING TO SOLVE THESE KIND OF. MOST WORK WITH THESE MOST MOST VULNERABLE OF PATIENTS. THESE ARE NOT. THE INTERVENTIONS WERE GOING TO DO FOR WITH INDIVIDUALS NOT GOING TO BE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE A RAPID TURNAROUND. RIGHT AND SO AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL I'VE SEEN THIS THURSDAY LET'S EXPAND WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO AND WILL SHORTEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME IN WHICH YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT AND THOSE TRENDS JUST. IT DOESN'T WORK RIGHT ONE HAS TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A KIND OF LONG RAMP UP PERIOD TO MAKE THAT WORK. AND SO AS WERE THINKING ABOUT STRATEGIES DAY WE DO HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THIS TENSION BETWEEN. LAYERS OF VULNERABILITY MEAN WE HAVE A KIND OF BIGGER FOCUS ON WHAT WE NEED TO DO BUT AT THE SAME TIME. WE ALREADY AVE A VERY TAXED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND IF ANYTHING IT'S- GETTING MORE TAXED BY THE DAY- AND SO BRINGING THOSE TWO TOGETHER AND ADDRESSING THOSE TWENTY ISSUES WHICH SOMETIMES. BUT HEADS. IS GOING TO BE KEY TO BEING SUCCESSFUL AND I'LL STOP THERE SO I DON'T TAKE ALL THE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER STUDENTS GIVE A ROUND APPLAUSE. YOUR TESTIMONY. HI AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SHE SHOULD BE I'M A FAMILY YEAH I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO SAY YOUR SURVEYS YOUR SHIP IF YOU COULD PUSH THE MICROPHONE CLOSER TO USE MAKE UP WITH THAT LETTER IT IS NOT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI I'M SURE SHOULD BE IT I'M A FAMILY PHYSICIAN AND I'M A CLINICAL PROFESSOR UCSF- AS WELL AS A CLINICIAN AT SOUTHEAST HEALTH CENTER AND I HAVE TO SAY I LOVE MY PREP COORDINATOR ACTUALLY WITH THE BENEFIT OF THAT PROGRAM- BUT I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT MY ROLE IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE TRANSITIONS CLINIC NETWORK WHICH IS A NON PROFIT NETWORK OF A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS. ACROSS THE STATE AND COUNTRY THAT PROVIDE HEALTH SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE RETURNING FROM INCARCERATION. SO I AS YOU ALL PROBABLY HAVE HEARD EARLIER IN THE DAY- INCARCERATIONS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTS PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING. WITH HIV HEPATITIS C. AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS I'M NOT GOING TO KIND OF DETAIL IN YOU KNOW THE OUTLINE OF COULD WHAT HAPPENS DURING INCARCERATION I REALLY WANT TO FOCUS MORE ON. THE TRANSITION. FROM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BACK TO THE COMMUNITY. BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT- WHAT PEOPLE ARE INCARCERATED THEIR IN A VERY HIGHLY STRUCTURED ENVIRONMENT- IT'S- OFTEN TIMES EASIER TO GET THEIR- CHRONIC CONDITIONS UNDER CONTROL H. A. B. IS A GOOD EXAMPLE- WE OFTEN SEE PEOPLE. HAVING REDUCE VIRAL LOADS IN THE CABLE TO SEE SUSTAIN THOSE IN THAT ENVIRONMENT. AND IT'S THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE THEN RETURNED TO THE COMMUNITY THAT OFTENTIMES VERY DIFFICULT TO SUSTAIN THOSE GAINS THAT PEOPLE MAY EXPERIENCE DURING PERSPIRATION IN THE COMMUNITY- ONE STUDY FOR INSTANCE SHOWED THAT. OF PEOPLE COMING OUT OF INCARCERATION- ONLY 30% OF THEM PICKED UP THE PEOPLE WITH HIV ONLY 30% OF THEM PICKED UP THEIR- MEDICATIONS IN THE FIRST SIXTY DAYS POST RELEASE. I'M IN A BIG PART OF THIS IS THAT THERE'S REALLY VERY LITTLE- CONTINUITY OF CARE FROM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO THE PRIMARY HEALTH. SYSTEM THE CROW JUSTICE SYSTEM IS A PUNITIVE ENTITY. INTEL RE. THERE WAS ALMOST NO FUNDING IN PLACE TO PROVIDE ANY SORT OF DISCHARGED. SERVICES OF FOR PEOPLE ARE RETURNING FROM CAR SERRATION AND AS A RESULT OF WHAT WE SEE IS THAT PEOPLE ARE. MORE LIKELY TO DIE GET THE POSED PLEASE. NO IN ADDITION TO THE CONDITIONS OF SITTING THERE MORE LIKE TO BE. SO WE KNOW THAT ONE IN TWELVE P. THE HOSPITAL IN THE FIRST NINE DAYS. PROBABLY OF WHAT ALSO THAT PEOPLE TO. OVER PARTY OF. DISEASE IS. AND CONNECTIONS OF CARE FROM THE INCARCERATED SETTING UP BACK TO THE COMMUNITY. SO THE WORK THAT WE DO IN THE TRANSITIONS CLICK NETWORK IS REALLY- WORKING WITH THE PRIMARY CARE SYSTEM TO TRANSFORM WHAT CLINICS DUE TO BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE COMING HOME AND REALLY TRY TO CLOSE THAT GAP. AND PROVIDE CONTINUITY OF CARE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING HOME FROM INCARCERATION AND- IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT MEMBER GIPSON STEPPED OUT BECAUSE WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY IS ACTUALLY REALLY APPRECIATE PEOPLE SHARING. THEIR PERSONAL STORIES OF HOW THIS EPIDEMIC HAS IMPACTED THEM BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT. MOTIVATES PEOPLE TO MAKE CHANGE AND DO THE WORK AND THAT WE'VE REALLY. IN OUR WORK WE REALLY FOCUS ON PEOPLE WHO- HAVE THAT SHARED EXPERIENCE THAT LIVED EXPERIENCE OF INCARCERATION WHO ARE THEN REALLY MOTIVATED. TO HELP OTHERS WHO ARE OMING HOME FROM INCARCERATION WE ALWAYS SAY THAT THOSE CLOSEST TO THE PROBLEM ARE CLOSEST TO THE SOLUTION AND SO. IN OUR MODEL OF CARE WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO ENGAGE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING OUT OF INCARCERATION. OF ALL OF OUR CLINICS HIRE AND TRAIN AN EMPLOYEE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS WHO HAVE LIVED. EXPERIENCE OF INCARCERATION- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO WITH THE CLINICS IS THAT WE WORK WITH THEM ALSO TO TRANSFORM THEIR CARE TO BETTER MEET NEEDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING HOME SO. I'M I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT STIGMA TODAY AND DISCRIMINATION FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING. WITH HIV HEPATITIS C. AND OTHER SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS. WHAT WE KNOW IF THERE WAS ACTUALLY PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING OUT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ALSO. THIS DISCRIMINATE THERE A STUDY IN CANADA THAT SHOW P. WHO HAD. OF AN PART. WERE HALF LIKELY TO GET UP CARE. CLINIC CANADA. OF UNIVERSE COVERAGE. I'M SO THAT WE KNOW THAT IN HANDS OF HOUSES. PEOPLE ARE BEING DISCRIMINATED AND SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT INDIVIDUALS MAY NOT WANT TO ENGAGE WITH THE SYSTEM PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED THE- JUSTICE IS. REALLY TRUST ALSO. OFF BECAUSE OF IT AFFECTS. THAT THEY HAD IN. AS KNOW OUR- PRESENCE. ON FOR FIRST TO OPEN ACTUALLY THE PATIENT'S AGE IN THE OTHER DAY YOU KNOW. YOU HAVEN'T. INSTEAD OF AIMING THE SYSTEM DOES VALUE YOU AND THEN IT'S VERY HARD TO VALUE. AND SO WHEN PEOPLE ARE COMING OUT THIS SORT OF HAVE A LEARNS NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE ABOUT ENGAGING WITH HEALTH SERVICES WITH PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. OF THAT REALLY THEN COMES INTO PLAY AN ENGAGING AND SERVICES SO IF WE REALLY WANT TO. AND THE EPIDEMIC IN ENGAGE PEOPLE TO CARE WE HAVE TO TRANSFORM WHAT WE DO WITH THE PRIMARY CARE SYSTEM. SORRY CLINICS ALL HIRE AN EMPLOYEE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS WITH HISTORIES OF INCARCERATION THEY DO OUT REACH INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO MEET PEOPLE PRIOR TO RELEASE- OR MEET THEM IN THE COMMUNITY THAT GO TO HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS. RESIDENTIAL DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAMS PROBATION FOR A WEBER YOU MIGHT FIND PEOPLE WHO ARE RECENTLY RELEASED. I'M AND THEY WORK TO BUILD TRUST WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE THEM FEEL COMFORTABLE TO UTILIZE THE PRIMARY CARE SYSTEM WE ALSO WORK WITH THE CLINICS TO TRAIN THEM HOW TO BETTER CARE FOR PATIENTS TO REDUCE STIGMA. AND UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING HOME. BUT WE WERE TO TRANSFORM SYSTEMS I THINK KIND OF TO YOUR POINT. I MEAN IF YOU HAVE A FIFTEEN MOST CLINICS HAVE A FIFTEEN MINUTE LATE POLICY YOU KNOW YOU SHOW UP FIFTEEN MINUTES LATE TO YOUR VISIT AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE SEEN YOU KNOW YOUR PROVIDER MAY EVEN HAVE OF. A POLICY LIKE THAT- BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING PAID PER VISIT AND SO THEY REALLY NEED TO MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF VISITS THAT THEIR BEINGS YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE SEEING. THEY HAVE TO KEEP ON SCHEDULE- AND SO WHAT WE FIND IS THAT YOU SHOW UP FOR THE CLINIC BUT SO YOU'RE MAKE A BIG EFFORT TO GET THEIR YOUR RECENTLY RELEASED FROM PRISON MAYBE DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET AROUND THE COMMUNITY. OR YOU'RE RUNNING THE BUSES RUNNING LATE THEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE SEEN AND THAT. YOU KNOW THAT ONE SHOT THAT THE CLINIC HAS TO ENGAGE YOU REALLY KIND OF GOES OUT THE WINDOW AND SO WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE SYSTEMS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN IN VIRTUALLY. TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM WANTING TO ENGAGE WITH THOSE SYSTEMS. BUT WE ALSO WORK WITH SYSTEMS TO HELP THEM ADDRESS MORE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES AS WELL AS MEDICARE IS. TREATMENT AND ALL THE OF TO TRY. OF IT MIGHT TO. OKAY YEAH PROCEEDS. OF THIS IS WHAT OKAY I IN BED THAT OF FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS BUT WE DO APPAREL DECORATING WHICH IS SCREEN PRINTING AND MANY PEOPLE LEARN SCREEN PRINTING IN PRISON SO BASICALLY EVERYBODY THAT I HIRED THROUGH ALL THOSE YEARS WHO HAD EXPERIENCE HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED SO I'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK REALLY CLOSELY WITH THOSE FOLKS AND TRY TO HELP THEM IN THEIR TRANSITION BUT THERE'S A LOT OF BARRIERS WHEN YOU'RE AN EMPLOYER. TRYING TO HELP THE PERSON OR GET INFORMATION THAT YOU CAN POLLS KIND OF IN THE BACK DOOR. YOU KIND OF SEE WHAT'S GOING ON YOU CAN ASK BECAUSE IT'S YOU WANT TO HELP THEM BUT THERE'S NOT REALLY AVENUES TO HELP THEM. SO MY THOUGHT IS I MEAN. AS SOMEONE WHO HAS SEEN MANY MANY PEOPLE THROUGH THE YEARS WHO COME IN REALLY WANTING TO TURN THEIR LIVES AROUND AND THEN GO DOWN THE SLIPPERY SLOPE TIME AND TIME AGAIN BEING HELPLESS BECAUSE I CAN ASK QUESTIONS I DON'T KNOW WHO TO ASK OF THOSE BARRIERS. HOW DO WE BREAK THOSE BARRIERS SO THAT THIS CAN BE SOME COMMUNICATION BUT WHO DO I TALK TO ONE I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW MY EMPLOYER IF MY EMPLOYEE IS NOT SHOWING UP TODAY SOME REASON OR- I MEAN THAT'S IT I THINK YOU JUST MADE THE CASE FOR WHY WE NEED COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS WITH HISTORIES ON CARTRIDGE IN THE CLINIC AND WHY WE NEED THESE PROGRAMS BECAUSE WERE TRAINING THE- HOW DO YOU ASK THREE. NEWS OR PORT HOW DO YOU PROBATION I'M A PHYSICIAN NO ONE EVER TAUGHT ME HOW DO I WORK WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM RIGHT SO ALL THESE THINGS ARE THINGS THAT WE HAVE A LOT. AND WE THE TO DO WE DO HAVE PEOPLE ARE JUST OUT PRISON GEORGE ALTHOUGH THAT WE LOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO BEEN SICK AS TERMS WHO CAN THAT BE MEN IN LEAVE THE FOR OTHER OKAY THAT PIECES SO THAT YOU'VE THE RIGHT PERSON THAT'S ARE ROLE IS LOOKING THE- THEY WERE REAL BUILDING THESE. WITH THE CARE RIGHT IN THIS BUT IS WHY OF THE LARGEST GROWING AND- YOU PEOPLE WERE HAD TO BUY THE CROWD UPPER. PATIENTS INTO PRIMARY CARE SERVICES UTILIZING THE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND IN THAT STUDY WE FOUND THAT PATIENTS WHO RECEIVE CARE IN OUR PROGRAMS HAD 51% FEWER EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS IN THE FIRST TWELVE MONTHS POST RELEASE IN A SUBSEQUENT STUDY WE FOUND THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO RECEIVED CARE IN OUR PROGRAM AS COMPARED TO A PROPENSITY MATCH PROGRAM I'M IN ANOTHER JURISDICTION- HAD FEWER PREVENTABLE HOSPITALIZATION SO IF YOU'RE A CHRONIC CONDITION LIKE HIV IF YOU'RE TREATED IN THE PRIMARY CARE SETTING YOU CAN PREVENT THOSE HOSPITALIZATIONS. OUR PROGRAM WAS SHOWN TO DO THAT AS WELL AS TO REDUCE CRIMINAL JUSTICE OUTCOMES SO OUR PATIENTS HAVE FEWER- OF PAROLE AND PROBATION VIOLATIONS AND- IF THEY ARE RE INCARCERATED THEY SPEND TWENTY FIVE DAYS FEWER IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WHICH RESULTS AT SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PEOPLE. I MEAN PER YEAR EXCUSE ME PER PERSON PER YEAR AND SO IF YOU HAVE NINETY PEOPLE IN ONE CLINIC YOU CITY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A YEAR PERIOD OF TIME OTHER STUDIES HAVE SHOWN YOU KNOW THERE'S A OF A STUDY- RCTI OUT OF LA THAT SHOWED THAT- UTILIZING HEALTH WORKERS WITH HISTORY YOU KNOW LIVED EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH PEOPLE WITH HISTORIES WHEN CHIN ALSO ROBERT. SUSTAIN IMPROVED OF VIRAL LOADS OVER THE TWELVE MONTHS POST RELEASE SO IT'S NOT JUST OP PROGRAM BUT I THINK IT REALLY KIND AS I MAY THOSE CLOSE PROP A THIS SHOULDN'T CHANGE EXIST TO IT PEOPLE HAD TO THIS IS A REALLY WHAT IN A THIS UP I THINK ONE OTHER KEY POINT IS THAT. WE DID SEE FROM ONE OF PROGRAM IN COUNTRY TWENTY SOARED DOWN TO WIN SITES IN THIRTEEN COUNTIES A CUTS IS SO IN I'M SORRY IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS THE JAIL IS MAKING UP FOR PEOPLE IN PRIMARY CARE REAL AND ONLY. PERCENT GOING AND WHEN THE YOU NEED HOW RECORDS WHEN THE GYM AND END OF THAT RATE IN A TO OR SO. THAT'S SO CAN OCCUR I WAS VERY LOW THAT SHARE OF WAS SIFT OUT ANY HELP AND BUT- TO BE ABLE TO INTERFACE WITH PEOPLE. OR TO RE. ACROSS THE IT'S VERY THE IT. BRIDGE THE SYSTEMS AND REALLY MAKE CHIANG ACROSS SYSTEM WE NEED TO SEE SOME CHANGES KIND OF MORE TOWARDS A CONTINUITY OF CARE AND KIND OF OPENNESS TO WORKING WITH HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS ACROSS THE BOARD AND SO WITH THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH. SURE MISS WALDRON JUST JUST- ONE OF THE THINGS IN MY LOCAL JAIL. AROUND IN VISTA. IN MY DISTRICT- THEY HAVE A THEY WORK REALLY CLOSE WITH THE VETERANS THEY HAVE A WHOLE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION. WING OF THE JAIL AND- WHAT THEY DO WHEN THE PEOPLE OF RELEASED IS. YOU KNOW IF THEY HAVE A SUBSTANCE USE ISSUE- WHEN THEY REPORT FOR THEIR PAROLE. VISIT AT THAT TIME THEY'RE GETTING THE RIVER TALL. SO ITS ALL TIME TO SO IN A WAY TO HELP TO KEEP THEM. ON THE SCHEDULE YEAH I MEAN IT WORKS BEAUTIFULLY WHEN THEY'RE ON PAROLE AND THEN WHEN THEY'RE NOT I'M PAROLE. WHAT HAPPENS I MEAN WE'RE REALLY WE'RE IN PRIMARY CARE WERE IN IT FOR THE LONG HAUL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE YOU LIKE YOU SEE IN YOUR PROGRAM THAT CYCLE IN AND OUT. YOU HAVE TO CREATE SYSTEMS THAT. EIGHTEEN THAT MEANS THAT REALLY BUILDING. THERE WERE YOU KNOW TREATING THEM LIKE HUMANS THE RESPECT NOT FORCING THEM TO YOU KNOW THAT'S ESSENTIALLY LIKE FORCING THEM FOR THE TREATMENT SO. IT'S GOOD FOR THE SHORT TERM BUT I THINK LONG TERM WE'RE LOOKING FOR- SOLUTIONS THAT ARE REALLY GOING TO BE MORE SUSTAINABLE AND EACH- CLIENTS SERVICES. DOC SURVEY THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH JUST GIVE A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR KIND WORDS I WAS TOLD WHEN I WAS OUT THE ROOM THAT JUST TALKED ABOUT MY STORIES OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BUT AGAIN IT'S IS EXAMPLE THAT THIS IS NO RESPECT OF PERSON MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ON WHAT TITLE YOU MATRICULATED TO- THIS IS ALL OF OUR FIGHT. AND WE'RE IN IT TO WIN IT AND SO WITH THAT- WE HAVE REPRESENTATIVE MARIO PRESS. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN GIPSON- GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MARIO PETTUS ON THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION. OF ETERNITY PROGRAMS FOR THE LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU- I WANTED TO START BY SHARING- MY PERSPECTIVE ACT I'M A PART OF THE SOUTH LA. A AND I GREW UP DURING THE CRACK EPIDEMICS IN THE EPIDEMIC THAT AGAIN VIOLENCE. AND IN MANY WAYS THAT- INFORM MY WORK- AROUND HIV AND WAS ON A SOUTH LA- PORCH THAT I READ- DOCTOR COOPSMESSAGE TO AMERICA. ABOUT THE HIV EPIDEMIC. SOMEONE TO START- BY SHEREEN AT THE COUNTY LEVEL WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING. LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL RESOURCES AND PUTTING THEM TO USE IN A MATTER THAT HAS THE GREATEST IMPACT AND WE HAVE. THE UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE OF WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WHO HAVE BEEN AT- AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE H. EVERY RESPONSE- DOMESTICALLY. AND OF THE LAST THIRTY YEARS AND THEN WORKING WITHIN- THE ESTABLISHMENTS AND STRUCTURES THAT GOVERNMENT HAS PUT IN PLACE. I THINK ALL THE SPEAKERS TODAY. HAVE OFFERED- VERY USEFUL FEEDBACK- ABOUT SOME OF THOSE STRUCTURES AND SYSTEMS I WANT TO SHED LIGHT ON SOME THINGS WERE SEEN AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. THE FIRST IS- LA COUNTY IS HOME 226% OF CALIFORNIANS- AS SOON WITH ME NOW. BUT WE SHOULDER ABOUT A THIRD OF THE STATE'S HIV AND STD EPIDEMICS- CALIFORNIA OUR GEAR GOLDEN STATE- HAS THE UNFLATTERING DISTINCTION. OF NOW BEING A LEADER- IN TERMS OF THE ABSOLUTE- NUMBER OF CASES- WITH RESPECT HIV AN INTERNMENT ONLY WITH STDS. AND IT'S TROUBLING THAT WE ARE LOSING PROGRESS TO OTHER PARTS- OF- OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND IT'S SOBERING THAT. VERY PROGRESS THROUGHOUT. AND SO- THE FIRST. THE FIRST OBSERVATION I WANT TO SHARE IS THAT WE HAVE A SERIOUS CAPACITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA WE CAN EXPECT TO RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDS TO FURTHER ENHANCE OUR RESPONSE TO HIV OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS BASED ON THE NATIONAL ANY EPIDEMIC INITIATIVE. BUT I FEAR THAT WE DO NOT HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND WORKFORCE- NECESSARY TO MOBILIZE AND MARSHALL RESOURCES IN A WAY THAT HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT ON A MUCH MORE UP MOTHER FATHER EARLIER SHED LIGHT ON ON THIS. WE HAVE GOAL TO DIAGNOSE TREAT AND PREVENT HIV- BUT WE STILL HAVE VERY ON EVEN PERFORMANCE IF YOU'RE PART OF THE RYAN WHITE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. YOU HAVE SOME OF THE BEST HEALTH OUTCOMES IF YOU ARE NOT PART THE RYAN WHITE SYSTEM YOU HAVE HEALTH OUTCOMES ARE POOR UP OR DIAGNOSIS FOR RATES. REALLY GETS TO CARE RATE. THIS ENCOURAGED A DOCTOR CAREMARK'S DOM REFERENCE TO CARE COORDINATION AS PART OF THE MEDICAID SYSTEM THAT IS BEEN A STAPLE IN THE RYAN WHITE SYSTEM FOR TWO DECADES AND SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME SOLUTIONS THERE THAT WE NEED TO EXTRAPOLATE FROM THE RYAN WHITE SYSTEM ALL THE OTHER HEALTH CARE DELIVERY COMES CALIFORNIA I DARE SAY THAT WE NEED TO GO THROUGH SOME SERIOUS HEALTH FROM IN STATE. ARTISTS ARE TOO MANY WELL WITH UNDIAGNOSED HIV INFECTION IN CALIFORNIA KERN AFTER POPULAR TWENTY THOU. IT IS GETTING HER. PART DIAGNOSED PEOPLE WITH HIV THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE SHADOWS AND MARGINS AND WE'RE GONNA MEET STATE POLICY. TO HELP CHANGE SYSTEMS OF HEALTH CARE SO THAT WE ROUTE NICE HIV TESTING. IT'LL HELP- NORMALIZE IT AND I THINK THAT WILL BE ABLE TO DIAGNOSE A BIG CHUNK OF THE TWENTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS LIVING WITH HIV OR UNDIAGNOSED. AS LONG AS HE COMPLIMENTED WITH THE STILL VERY IMPORTANT TARGETED HIV POSITIVE WOULD HAVE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WE ABSOLUTELY NOT. READY OURSELVES TO GET TO AN HIV FINISH LINE WHILE WE HAVE UNACCEPTABLY HIGH LEVELS OF SYPHILIS AND YOU HEARD A LOT ABOUT SYPHILIS TODAY. A STILL ROBUST MATH EPIDEMIC. HOMELESSNESS THE CONTINUES TO- OUTPACE- ALL THE SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE AND INCREASINGLY IT CAN'T JUST BE ABOUT THE HIV EPIDEMIC THEIR INTERSECTING EPIDEMICS- YOU'LL HEAR FROM SOME MICHAEL PALACE REFER TO SEND THAT MAKES THAT TO BE PART OF THE PACKAGE OF INTERVENTIONS THERE ARE WE'RE PUTTING FOR- OTHERWISE WE'RE NEVER GOING TO MEET THE HIV WE'RE NOT GONNA GET TO THE- END OF THE H. M. MAKE FINISH LINE AND A- ALL THE THING. YES COUPLE TO BUY PRATT WE HAVE A AS MANY PEOPLE HAVE SAID ONCE IN A GENERATION OPPORTUNITY TO CRIPPLE HIV WE HAVE VERY VERY UNEVEN PREP- AWARENESS WILLINGNESS AND ENROLLMENT PATTERNS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA IF YOU ARE YOUNG LACKEY GAME MAN IF YOU'RE BLACK LATINO IF YOU'RE BLACK GAY MAN OR TRANSGENDER WOMAN. GROUPS WHO THE HIGHEST RATES OF HIV SEROCONVERSION ARE AWARE. AND ENROLLING AT RATES ARE THERE ANY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THEY SHOULD BE AND SO WE NEED TO- MARSHALL MORE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT. WHAT I BELIEVE WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT COMPLEMENT TO THE PREFACE THIS IS PROBABLY CALIFORNIA AND HATS OFF TO OUR STATE LEADERS FOR MAKING CRAP APP- A FABRIC OF OUR HEALTHCARE. DELIVERY SYSTEM BUT WE NEED PREP NAVIGATORS TO MAKE SURE THAT CRAP ACT THIS HAPPENS. INCREASINGLY IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND NAVIGATE THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS BUT THE COMPLEXITIES AND WE NEED FOLKS WHO CAN HELP- SOMEONE GO FROM EIGHT A. B. AND STAY ENGAGED AND SOME OF LIFESAVING PREVENTION. OPPORTUNITIES MISTER OF THAT S. IF I MAKE THIS WARNING CHIME IN AND I. I WANNA MAKE SURE CAPTION SOMETHING HE SAID WHAT I'M HEARING- AND MY COLLEAGUE CAN TELL ME IF SHE'S. SAME THING. WHO SCORED THIS COURT. UP I DON'T SEE AN NOR DO I HEAR A CONCERTED EFFORT IN TERMS OF COORDINATION WITH ALL AGENCIES EVERYONE IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE DOING THEIR OWN THING IN OUR OWN SILO BUT THERE'S NO ARCH UP QUARTER NATION TAKING PLACE SO THAT WE CAN ONE ADDRESSED THE GAPS WHEN WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE AND COORDINATING AND THIS THING THAT WE CAN FILL THOSE GAPS IF YOU POLICY AND OR FORCES SO MIKE XIN. YOU CAN ANSWER IT NOW OR WE CAN WALK TO LATER IS THERE ARE THE NATIVE EFFORT THAT SHE LED BY THIS IT IN MY MIND. BRING ALL OF THESE TO TALK ABOUT HOW DO WE AND I DO BY ON THE DAY THESE HOLES OR GAPS IN AREAS THAT SHOULD BE FILLED- MISTER MALDONADO TALKED ABOUT- WITH THE EXPERIENCE- HE'S FACED WITH AND THOSE WHO LIVE IN IT IN TERMS HAVING TO TRAVEL SO ARE TO LOS ANGELES TO RECEIVE THREE. BECAUSE THIS IS A THEIR GLUTAMIC- OF FACILITY IN THE AT ARMS SAMPLE DINNER RIVERSIDE AREA AND SO I DON'T HERE AND MAYBE I'M GOING DEAF I NEED A DOCTOR IN A ROOM TO HELP ME I DON'T HEAR THERE'S A CAN OF COORDINATION TAKING. MY MIND MAY. ALL THE BRIEFEST IN A PANELISTS CHIME IN AND YOU HAVE A FEW AND ROOM TODAY THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP. I THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A NO WRONG DOOR APPROACH TO THE SEND THAT MAKES THAT WERE SEEN ITSELF SOMEONE IS MOTIVATED ENOUGH TO STAY HIV NEGATIVE AND ACCESS CRAP THAT PREPPING COUNTER TO THE END OF IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S OTHER- ISSUES OR SERVICE MADE AVAILABLE IF THE MEDICAID SYSTEM IS PROVIDING CARE TO THE LARGEST NUMBER OF HIV POSITIVE CALIFORNIANS POSSIBLE AND THOSE IN. CAN THEN MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S TAP SEAT ARE GREEN AND TREATMENT OPPORTUNITY AVAILABLE SO WE COULD FIGURE OUT AS A AS AS MULTIPLE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM SORT OF HOW HOW THAT HAPPENS BUT I'M GONNA I'M GONNA MAKE MY LAST POINT AND THEN- I THINK THE COMPOUND THIS WANT TO JUMP AND FOR THAT. IT'S AN AROUND WHY ARE SOME OF THESE THINGS HAPPENING- TRANSPHOBIA HOMOPHOBIA HIV STIGMA SHAME MEDICAL MISTRUST ARE ARE ONLY FIVE OF THE MYRIAD OF THINGS THEY CONTINUE TO INFLUENCE HOW PEOPLE ACCESS SYSTEM AND HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S PRO CHOICE THAT ADDRESSES AND CONSIDERS ALL THOSE THINGS I THINK PREP NAVIGATE. CAN HELP SOME OF THE THINGS WE NEED MORE SORT OF NORMALIZATION ACROSS SOME OF THESE BUT PARTICULARLY AMONG YOUNG AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN IN LA DONE WHAT THE YOU KNOW MAN THOSE ARE STILL THINK WE OFTEN OUT OF THE- MEDICAL ENVIRONMENT. IS SIR PACKED THE- HEALTH CARE AT RATES AMONG AT THE ALEJO THERE'S NO OF EXTERNAL FORCES THAT AWFUL INFLUENCE AT WORK IT'S WHEN A GROUP CALLED UP VERY QUICKLY BACK IN A MINUTE THE FOR- TO THEN SPEAKER. IN CALIFORNIA THE TWENTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS. IF WE HAVE A POLICY IN CALIFORNIA THAT FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS ONLY TIME LIMITED. WE SAY IN THE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MOST IMPACTED COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA LET'S THAT THE LET'S ADOPT MANDATORY ROUTINE OPT OUT HIV TESTING. AND THE OR CARE SETTINGS I THINK WE CAN GET A BIG CHUNK OF CALIFORNIANS DIAGNOSE WE HAVE A MODEL IS THIRTY YEARS OLD IN THE STATE WE HAVE ROUTINE OPT OUT HIV TESTING FOR ALL PREGNANT WOMEN. AND WE HAVE A WONDERFUL PART OF SUCCESS BECAUSE THERE'S VERY VERY FEW CALIFORNIA BABIES BORN WITH HIV AND SO WE IT'S GONNA BE COOL HIGHER PURSUIT POSSIBLE POLICY. GONNA MAKE MORE PROGRESS IN YEARS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT QUESTION OFF LINE BECAUSE I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO BE THAT BALL. THANK YOU FOR. LET'S GIVE MR FOR AS A ROUND OF APPLAUSE AND THANK HIM FOR HIS TESTIMONY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU CHAIRMAN GIPSON AND MEMBER WALDRON- MEN'S CHRISTIAN RUMORS OF AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR AND JUST ADDED- ADDICTION MEDICINE TONIGHT. SIR BOARD CERTIFICATION LAST WEEK ACTUALLY JUST A TESTAMENT TO THE FACT THAT THESE EPIDEMICS INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER- I'M GONNA SCRAMBLE MY COMMENT A LITTLE BIT LIKE WAYNE. AT THE RISK OF A COMING INTELLIGENT BUT I FEEL YOU'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER THIS AFTERNOON THAT WE HAVE THIS GREAT SCHOOLS WE HAVE RULES THAT ARE NEW. NO SEARCH TOOLS LIKE RAP. DAY V. RULES YOU. FOR HAVE SEE WE AMAZING TO WE HAVE TREATMENT THAT IS SO BETTER THAN IT WAS TO FIVE AGO. I'M AND IF WE THESE INCREDIBLE TOOLS WHY ARE WE SEEING THE HIGHEST RATES OF THESE DISEASES. THAT WE EVER SEEN Y. WIRE STDS THE HIGHEST ARE IN THIRTY YEARS WHY ARE YOUNG PEOPLE. HAVE A TWO FOLD INCREASE IN NEW HAVE C. DIAGNOSES WHY NATIONALLY DO WE HAVE A 4100% INCREASE IN HEPATITIS C. INFECTIONS- AND I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. MY BACKGROUND BUT THE THINK. YEAH SEE IT. HAVE BEEN MEN. EPIDEMICS THAT WE FACED OF THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY THAT WHEN THERE IS A WELL COORDINATED AND WELL FUNDED RESPONSE WE HAVE VERY GOOD RESULTS THE RYAN WHITE CARE MODEL IS ONE OF THOSE IT'S A COMPREHENSIVE MODEL WITH MENTAL HEALTH WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE WITH HOUSING ISSUES WITH DRUG ASSISTANCE WITH INSURANCE THAT DOES GIVE INCREDIBLE OUTCOMES. PEPFAR PROGRAM THREE IN AFTER THE GLOBAL FUND TO FIGHT AIDS TB AND MALARIA THE SMALL POX NATION YOU HAVE A WELL COORDINATED WELL FUNDED REPLY WE CAN THINGS. THE QUESTION WHERE IS. THE CO. AMONGST UPDATE. SENATOR WIENERACTUALLY JUST WROTE A BILLS SB EIGHT FIFTY NINE WHICH ARTICULATES. THIS COORDINATED RESPONSE THAT I THINK WE NEED- IN IN OUR OUR STATE. LET ME GIVE A LITTLE MORE BACKGROUND ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN SAN DIEGO I COME FROM TODD GLORIA TERRITORY- DOWN IN SAN DIEGO AND- I WORK AT A FQHC NETWORK CALLED THE FOR THE FAMILY HEALTH CENTERS OF SAN DIEGO. OF A CLINICAL POINT MINUTE UC SAN DIEGO SCHOOL AND ON THE CO CHAIR OF THE AMERICAN CARRY BASS HEAVY MEDICINE A CALIFORNIA CHAPTER WHICH REPRESENTS OVER SIX HUNDRED HIV PROVIDERS- WHO WE HAVE MAJOR WORK WORKFORCE ISSUES WITH HIV PROVIDRS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEN I HAVE A GLOBAL HEALTH WORKSTREAM AS WELL I WORK FOR THE CLINTON HEALTH ACCESS INITIATIVE. ON% HEPATITIS C. ELIMINATION- PROGRAMS IN SEVEN COUNTRIES IN ASIA AND AFRICA. MANY OF WHICH HAVE MUCH LOWER SPENDING ON HEPATITIS ELIMINATION AND YET ARE DOING A MUCH BETTER JOB THAN WE ARE BECAUSE THEY ARE COORDINATED I WANT TO WALK THROUGH- AND I ALSO COACH OR THE- AND HAVE SEE SAN DIEGO LIMITATION INITIATIVE IN OUR COUNTY. TO TRY TO ELIMINATE- HEPATITIS C. ONE WALK THROUGH THE CASCADE OF HEPATITIS C. CARE AND JUST TALK ABOUT SOME SOLUTIONS I THINK TO BE PRETTY PRETTY SIMPLE. AND THE CASKET OF CARE FOR NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT IS WALKING FROM. THE ABSOLUTE NUMBER OF CASES THAT WE THINK ARE THERE. TO THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED TO THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN LINKED TO CARE TO THOSE HAVE BEEN OFFERED TREATMENT TO THOSE THAT ARE KEYBOARD IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE. AND STRAIGHT FORWARD. ATTACKS THAT WE ALL HAVE. TURN TO THE NUMBER OF HEPATITIS C. CASES YOU'VE HEARD THAT WE HAVE ALMOST A HALF A MILLION CASES OF PEPSI. IN CALIFORNIA. AND YOU KNOW IT'S I TREAT HIV I TREAT STDS AS WELL AND IN HIV WE KNOW THAT THERE'S PROBABLY DIAGNOSED WE HAVE HALF OF PEOPLE HEPATITIS C. THEY'RE NOT DIAGNOSED. WHY IS THAT WELL IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE SEE DON'T ALWAYS PRESENT THEMSELVES TO CARE AND SAY LIKE I ANT TO ENGAGE IN CARE AND I WANT MY HEPATITIS C. TEST. IT IT'S A POPULATION THAT IT THAT TEND TO BE MORE DIFFICULT TO ENGAGE WHERE YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND REACH THEM PERHAPS AT A SYRINGE EXCHANGE. PERHAPS AT A AT A PRISON OR JAIL. PERHAPS IN A METHADONE CLINIC- PERHAPS OUT IN THE COMMUNITY. MY ORGANIZATION WAS FORTUNATE TO BE. A PART. AND FROM THE FROM THE POINT A PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO GO OUT AND ENGAGE PEOPLE ACTIVELY INJECTING DRUGS. AND TEST THEM PERHAPS LEAD TO SEE AND LINK THEM TO CARE AND GET THEM TREATED AND THERE'S AN AMAZING THING THAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DO THAT. THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT TYPICALLY YOU'VE HEARD A LOT FROM THE SPEAKERS TODAY TYPICALLY HAVE NOT ENGAGED IN THE TRADITIONAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THEY SEE SOME OF THE WHITE COAT LIKE THIS AND THEY RUN AWAY. BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY OF TRAUMA FROM INTERACTING WITH PEOPLE THAT HAVE STIGMATIZE THEM. AND TALK DOWN TO THEM AND NOT REALLY TREATED THEM LIKE HUMAN BEINGS. BUT IF YOU PUT YOUR HAND OUT YOU SAY- YOU KNOW WE CAN GIVE YOU INSURANCE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE CAN GIVE YOU MEDICAID. WE CAN DO IT HAVE SEE TESTING WE CAN ACTUALLY. DO SOMETHING ABOUT TAT IF YOU JUST COME AND JOIN US. AND YOU GAVE SOMEONE LIKE THAT AND LIKE MARIO SAID IT'S- A NO WRONG DOORS APPROACH YOU COME IN. AND GET A H. AT HALFTIME SEAT. THAT'S POSITIVE- YOUR ALSO PUTTING HER ONE. LET'S GIVE YOU THOSE SERVICES TO. AND I SEEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN. OWN PRACTICE OF. BEEN CURED OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE. OF HEPATITIS C. IN OUR CLINIC. THAT YOU BRING THEM IN THE DOOR THROUGH A METHADONE CLINIC THEY'RE NOT REACH PROGRAM THROUGH SYRINGE EXCHANGE THROUGH- PER. ENGAGING WITH OFFICERS AND YOU GET PEPSI TREATED AND CURED AND THEN THEY ENGAGE IN PRIMARY CARE. AND THEY WANT TO QUIT SMOKING. AND I WANT TO TAKE CARE THE HYPERTENSION. AND ONE TICKET THAT I BUSINESS ISN'T THAT WHAT THIS IS REALLY ALL ABOUT. IS NOT PROVIDING SINGLE VERTICAL EYES PROGRAM SO WE CAN. GOOD NUMBERS UP FOR HIV PROGRAMMER GOOD NUMBERS THAT PERHAPS THE PROGRAM. WE WANT HAVE HEALTHIER CALIFORNIANS ARE MORE ENGAGED IN THEIR CARE. SO YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE THAT THE CITIES IN THE US PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE STUDY OF LIVER DISEASES IN THE IDSA HAVE ALL NOW ALIGNED. AND RECOMMENDED UNIVERSAL OPT OUT ADULT HEPATITIS C. TESTING. THERE THERE WAS AN OPEN COMMENT PERIOD FOR U. S. P. S. T. AFTER GOTTA BE. RECOMMENDATION THE DRAFT FORM- BUT SO WE NEED TO BE TESTING A WHOLE LOT MORE AND MAYBE THAT'LL HELP. WITH GETTING THIS 50% OF PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT DIAGNOSED IN THROUGH THE DOOR- WE ALSO NEED TO TEST ON AN ANNUAL BASIS FOR THAT THE HIGHER RISK. AND WE NEED TO TEST NONTRADITIONAL SETTINGS NOT JUST IN CLINICS ARE NOT GONNA WALK UP AND KNOCK ON YOUR- DOOR. GOT TO GET OUT AT THIS EXCHANGES. OUT THE- IMPROVEMENTS. OUT IN THE STREET. I'M THERE ARE TWO TO TEST WANT ONE OF THE MOST ALL PLACES GO AND TEST FOR HEPATITIS DRUG ALCOHOL CENTER RIGHT MAKES SENSE WE HAVE RAPID YOU JUST DO A LITTLE FINGER **** OF BLOOD TWENTY MINUTES YOU HAVE A POSITIVE RESULT KILLING SOMEBODY- THEIR REGULATIONS IN PLACE TO DON'T REALLY ALLOW TESTING AND SOME OF THE THINGS BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S A BLOOD TEST. INTERESTED LIPSTICK CARE. WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO IN OUR SETTING IS I HAVE A ARMY OF ELEVEN PEOPLE THAT ARE TREATING HAVE SEE IT'S NOT JUST ME. IT'S NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS AND FAMILY PRACTITIONERS AND DO IS AN MD IS. ABLE TO TREAT A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN JUST ME MYSELF. AND JUST WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SUPPORT PRIMARY CARE FOLKS CAN TREAT HEPATITIS C. PRIMARY CARE FOLKS CAN DO PREP. PRIMARY CARE FOLKS WITH A LITTLE MORE SUPPORT CAN TO HIV CARE AND WE NEED A LOT OF. EMPHASIS IN IN WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. I SAW THAT- JOHN LEWIS IN GEORGIA INTRODUCED A OF FEDERAL BILL OFFERING. HONOR PAYMENT. TO GO OUT HIV OF. SOPHIE SURVIVE WAITING. PEOPLE INTO HIV WHEN THEY COME OUT OF MEDICAL SCHOOL OF CRUSHING. STUDENT LOAN DEBT. MOVING ON TO TREATMENT THE TREATMENT PART OF HEPATITIS C. MARK IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM HAS GOTTEN A WHOLE LOT EASIER THAN IT IS IN OTHER STATES. LAST TIME I WAS IN SACRAMENTO WE WERE FIGHTING. ABOUT THE RULES TO GETHAVE SEE TREATMENT WHICH REQUIRE THAT YOU BE SOBER FOR SIX MONTHS. THAT YOU ONLY SEE A SPECIALIST AND THAT YOU HAVE NEAR SNEER SERVICES IN YOUR LIVER. WE GOT THAT WAS REMOVED. WE'RE ONE OF THE LEADERS. THANK GOODNESS- TO THE MAP OUT PROGRAM. THANK YOU KAREN KAREN MARK BY THE WAY WAS MY ATTENDING PHYSICIAN IN MY FELLOWSHIP. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON SO IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. BUT I ALSO HEARD HER SAY THAT IT. CITY HIV MEDICINES DON'T HAVE PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH EASIER MY LIFE WOULD BE A PEPSI MEDICINE TO NOT A PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS. I HAVE A FULL TIME EMPLOYED NURSE IN MY CLINIC THAT HER ONLY JOB IS TO HANDLE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. IT IS AN INCREDIBLE BURDEN OF PAPERWORK I JUST TO GET SOMEBODY TREATED INVOLVES EXTRA TIME EXTRA BLOOD TESTS THAT AREN'T REALLY. NECESSARY WE JUST NEED TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE TO GET THESE PEOPLE TREATED. I THOUGHT I SHOULD BRING THIS UP NOW BECAUSE WITH THE MEDICATIONS THE ISSUE OF COST ALWAYS COMES UP. AND THAT'S BECAUSE WHEN THEY FIRST CAME OUT. THE MEDICINES WERE VERY HIGHLY PRIZED. THEY WERE HIGHLY PRIZED BECAUSE THE PRIOR TREATMENT WAS A YEAR LONG. REQUIRED OFTEN HOSPITALIZATIONS BLOOD TEST AND ONLY AT A 40% CURE RATE. AND NEARLY KILLED SOME OF THE PEOPLE ARE TREATED WITH THE OLD INTERFERON TREATMENT SO THE INNOVATION TO TAKE A PILL FOR JUST THREE MONTHS. HAD A BIG PRICE TAG ON IT. THERE WAS SOMETHING CALLED THE INSTITUTE FOR CLINICAL AND ECONOMIC REVIEW THAT WAS CONVENED- AND THE CALIFORNIA TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT FORM TOLD STUDY THIS ISSUE AND SAY WHY ARE THEY SO EXPENSIVE AND WHAT IS THE COST EFFECTIVENESS THRESHOLD. TO GET THESE HAVE SEE TREATMENTS DOWN TO WHERE IT'S REASONABLE. IN THE LINE THAT THAT COMMISSION CAME UP WITH A SPONSORED BY THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WAS FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER. DOOR TO MAKE IT A QUOTE UNQUOTE HIGH VALUE INTERVENTION FOR THE HEALTH SYSTEMS. THESE TREATMENTS ARE NOW FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER WAY UNDER THE COST EFFECTIVENESS CURE IN YET WE STILL HAVE SOME RESTRICTIONS ON ACCESSING THESE THERAPIES. IT IS A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE TO DO A LIVER TRANSPLANT. OR TO TAKE CARE OF SOME WITH THE ROSES IS NOT IT'LL FOUR FIVE TIMES A YEAR. THEN IT IS TO DEBT TO TREAT SOMEBODY BEFORE THEY GET THERE. FINALLY I THINK WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB OF SIMPLIFYING. THE TREATMENT ALGORITHMS FOR SOMEBODY THAT DOESN'T HAVE SEVERE LIVER DAMAGE IT'S REALLY PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD TO GET A MANY GIVEN PILLS FOR THREE MONTHS THEY GET CURED AT A 95% RATE. IN PRIMARY CARE FOLKS CAN BE DOING THAT WE JUST. WE JUST HAVE THE TOOLS WE JUST NEED TO DO IT. I'M GONNA FINISH TALKING ABOUT. PREVENTION OF PEPSI- BECAUSE IN SAN DIEGO THIS IS ACTUALLY IN OUR- AND HAVE SEE SAN DIEGO ONE OF THE MAJOR. BARRIERS I THINK TO REACHING ELIMINATION OF HEPATITIS C. WE ARE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO I COULD HAVE. THIRTY FORTY FIFTY PEOPLE. TREATING HAVE SEE WE'RE NOT GONNA AND THE EPIDEMIC BECAUSE WE'RE NOT PREVENTING NEW INFECTIONS. AND THERE'S A SIMPLE. SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTION CALLED SYRINGE EXCHANGE. THAT CAN ACTUALLY ENGAGE PEOPLE NOT ENGAGE IN HEALTH CARE CAN PREVENT HIV AND HEPATITIS C. TRANSMISSION AND CAN GIVE THEM OF. MUCH NEEDED OFFRAMP. FROM THE THROES OF ADDICTION THAT THEY ARE. ENGAGED IN- I'M A SUBOXONE PRESCRIBER I USED YOU CAN OFTEN FOR PEOPLE TO PUT USE DISORDER AND MOST OF MY PATIENTS. THAT COME AND GET ON THE PHONE OR BEEN REALLY DON'T LIKE USING DRUGS. THE USE IT'S JUST PREVENT THE FEELING THAT THEY HAVE WHEN THEY'RE WITHDRAWING LIKE THEY'RE GONNA DIE. EVERY EIGHT TO TWELVE HOURS. THEY DON'T GET ANY HIGH OFTEN ANYMORE MAYBE THEY DID WAY BACK. BEGINNING BUT THIS IDEA SYRINGE EXCHANGES IS GOING TO MAKE PEOPLE USE MORE DRUGS. IT'S LIKE BIRTH CONTROL PILLS TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY. SEC AND I'M- PEOPLE SEARCH FOR SOME. PLAN TO RE. DRUG USE. EVEN POPULATIONS NEED TO BE. TO OFFER. IN PLACES WHERE YOU'RE KNOCKING TO REACH THOSE. AND ANY OTHER WAYS- AND WE STILL RUN INTO BARRIERS IN IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY ACTUALLY WHERE IT'S OFFICIALLY STILL LEGAL TO YOU TO DO SIR INTERCHANGES. IT'S A GREAT. SERVE NO WRONG DOOR APPROACH WITH THE GATES PEOPLE AT THE METHADONE CLINICS AT THE SYRINGE EXCHANGES FOR TESTING. GET THEM IN THE DOOR AND WE CAN TAKE BETTER CARE OF THEM. SO I'M JUST GONNA CLOSE BY SAYING THAT- IT'S JUST LIKE THE AGONY AND THE ECSTASY OF THIS WHOLE AFTERNOON. IT'S AGONIZING TO HEAR THESE NUMBERS THAT- THAT THERE'S SO MANY NEW INFECTIONS. AND YET IT MAKES ME ECSTATIC TO THINK OF HOW CLOSE WE ARE AND HOW MANY TOOLS WE HAVE. TO END THE EPIDEMIC EIGHT WHETHER BE HIV ARE CITIES OR HEPATITIS C. I KIND OF MISSED OUT ON THE WHOLE CHANGING IT EVERY FROM A DEATH SENTENCE TO. A COMMAND PRODUCT OF THESE I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AT THE TIME. BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE AT THE PLACE WERE IN ANDY CHEVY. WE CAN TURN HEPATITIS C. TALKING IF KILLING MORE PEOPLE ANY OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASE IN OUR COUNTRY. TO SOMETHING THAT'S MANAGEABLE EVEN HAVING THAT'S ELIMINATED. SO GOT THIS OPPORTUNITY RIVER FRONT OF US I JUST HOPE WE TAKE ACTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NECKS NAME HELLO MY NAME IS AMY MORAN I AM CHIEF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS OFFICER AT ESSENTIAL ACCESS HEALTH AND WE CHAMPION AND PROMOTE QUALITY SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL IN CALIFORNIA AND BEYOND TO A BROAD RANGE OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES BUT I'LL FOCUS TODAY ON OUR WORK AROUND S. T. D. PREVENTION WE HAVE AN STD PREVENTION CENTER AND WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE COW AND DD TROWBRIDGE LA IT. THE PUBLIC HEALTH CARE CAN BE IS PROVIDERS AND- THE FRONT MIGHT EVERY DAY TO AND THAT. OF A- H. C. VI N. S. T. D.'S. AND SO HAVE THE- OF BEING THE FINAL PANELIST AFTER A VERY USEFUL AND INFORMATIVE AFTERNOON. AND I HOPE THAT TOGETHER WE HAVE PAINTED A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE THAT WE HAVE A SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS BUT WE ALSO. HAVE SOLUTIONS AVAILABLE- AND SO I'D GET THE FUN PART A LITTLE BIT TO WRAP IT UP AND SHARE SOME ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES OF WHAT I THINK WE CAN DO AT THE STATE LEVEL AND WHAT WE MUST DO TO HELP AB IT. AND WE HOPE WE'VE WAITED A SENSE OF. URGENCY FOR YOU ALL TO CONTINUE OUR LEADERSHIP AND INTEREST AND ATTENTION ON THIS ISSUE AND I WANNA I'M ALSO ECHO- THANKS TO THE CHAIR FOR SHARING YOUR PERSONAL COMMITMENT AND CONNECTION TO THE H. SO THAT YOU CAN HELP RATE IN AS ABOUT THE NEED ACT. HEREAMONG YOUR COLLEAGUES I'M- SO. I AM WILL SHARE AS AN ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES THAT- THE AND THE EPIDEMICS COALITION HAS COME UP WITH- THAT SHOWING THAT HOW THROUGH SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT OF STATE RESOURCES AND ENACTMENT OF SOUND PUBLIC HEALTH POLICIES. WE CAN AND MUST TO START MOVING THE NEEDLE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AROUND THESE EPIDEMICS. SO FIRST AROUND BUDGET ALLOCATIONS- WE HAVE AS A COALITION A PACKAGE THAT- CALLS FOR AN INVESTMENT OF AROUND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. TO DO AND THAT HAPPENED MIX AND TO BREAK IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT SEE YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE KIND OF HOW THE NUMBERS ADD UP TO IMPACT. WE ARE CALLING AND I'M THANK YOU FOR THAT IT'S VERY NICE SOFTBALL THAT YOU LAID OUT EARLIER- CHURCH MEN- WE ARE CALLING FOR A STATE MASTER PLAN TO NAB DE MAKES BECAUSE- I'M I DON'T KNOW IF I NEED TO GET MY EARS TO. TO BUT I HAVEN'T HEARD OF A MASTER COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO AND THAT THAT THAT MAKES ON THE STATE LEVEL AND IT'S TIME THAT WE DO THAT WE HAVE WONDERFUL PROGRAMS AS WE'VE HEARD THAT ARE WORKING INDIVIDUALLY. WE HAVE WONDERFUL. I'M OPPORTUNITY NOW WE JUST HAVE TO ENSURE THAT ALL TOGETHER RULES. CALLER DOLLARS TO HELP. THE DAY. THAT PLAN. AND MASS. ALSO CALLING FOR FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN SUPPORT FOR HIV PREVENTION ACTIVITIES FIFTEEN MILLION FOR H. C. V. PREVENTION ACTIVITIES- AN ADDITIONAL THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS TO BE ABLE TO- INCREASE. LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO CONDUCT- AN- STD PREVENTION ACTIVITIES AND WE'RE ALSO CALLING TO KIND OF CLOSE TO COVERAGE. DOUGHNUT HOLE RIGHT NOW FOR AS TD SERVICES FOR UNINSURED FOLKS WHO CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE A PATHWAY TO GET AS TV SERVICES- FOLKS RIGHT NOW R NOT AT RISK FOR CAUSING EXPERIENCING AN UNINTENDED PREGNANCY. AND WHO ARE LOW INCOME AN UNINSURED CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE A DIRECT GATE WITH BE GETTING. NO COST STD SERVICE. BUT WE HAVE A PROGRAM RIGHT NOW CALLED THE FAMILY PACK PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES FAILED PLANNING LATE TO. IN A TO IS AS FOR WHEN ON HEARD FOR. RIGHT NOW SERVICE HAVE TO BE PROVIDED WITH AN CONTACT TO THE FAMILY PLANNING VISIT AND RATHER THAN WELL WE WERE. NEXT AND ARE COMPREHENSIVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THROUGH THE MEDICAL PROBE FOR IT IT JUST MAKES TO CREATE A WHOLE NEW. PROGRAM WE ALREADY HAVE A PROVIDE NETWORK IN A PRO IN PLACE WE WANT TO. EXIST FAMILY PRO TO MOVE MORE IN CARE. AND WE'RE CALLING FOR TO DOLLARS TO HELP FUND TO THE GENERAL FUND. THE PLAN. TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THAT PH IN ADDITION WE HAVE AND CONNECTED TO THAT SB EIGHT EIGHT FIVE AUTHORED BY SENATOR PAN WOULD CALL FOR THAT EXPANSION OF THE FAMILY PACK PROGRAM FOR A- SHORT BOOKS TO ACCESS STDS SERVICES. ALSO FIVE INDIVIDUALS MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS GO OUT OF NETWORK AND HAVE FREEDOM OF CHOICE FROM A TRUCK PROVIDER AS- SAYS. AND TO ENSURE THAT THOSE ON. AND WILLING TO OBTAIN SERVICES. DIRECTLY AT A HEALTH CENTER CAN ACCESS AN EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTION CALLED EXPEDITED PARTNER. SO IF SOMEBODY COMES INTO A CLINIC AND HAVE. OF A POSITIVE TEST THE TASK IF THEY HAVE A THAT. ON WILL BE AROUND ABLE TO GO TO A CENTER FOR THEM SO. THEY BRING HOME TO. TO WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO INCREASE A DA UTILIZATION OF EVIDENCE BASED. SERVICE IN ADDITION A NINE SIX FIVE AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY ID CURRY WILL REDUCE H. IN. AND RISK FOR LIFE THE CAN. BY MARK THE FAMILY PACK PROGRAM TO COVER THE H. P. V. VACCINATION WHICH IT CURRENTLY DOES NOT BUT IT DOES HAVE OTHER STD PREVENTION HPV TESTING SO IT'S ALIGNED WITH THE PROGRAM'S INTENT. IN ADDITION- AUTHORED BY SENATOR WIENER IS SB NINE THIRTY TWO WHICH WOULD ALLOW COUNSELORS THAT ARE HIV COUNTS TO ADMINISTER RAPPER AS T. BUT AS TI TESTING. THESE COUNSELORS ARE ALREADY RAP H. C. TAG AND ADDING AS TV TO WITH THEM A ONE STOP SHOP IN A- ACCESS. I'M I ALSO WANT TO NOTE AND THAT THE COUNTIES HAVE ALSO ASKED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO HELP- FIND NAVIGATORS TO HALT- AND ADDRESS REINFECTION SO- WERE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT AS WELL. SO BY TAKING ACTION ON THESE BUDGET AND POLICY PRIORITIES AND SOME OF THE OTHER STRATEGIES THAT WERE- MENTIONED INCLUDING CREATING A STATE MASTER PLAN THAT INTEGRATES THE RESPONSE- TO ALL THREE EPIDEMICS CALIFORNIA CAN GET BACK ON THE RIGHT TRACK OF. OF LEADING THE WAY AND YOU KNOW AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY AND I THINK WE'VE HOPEFULLY WE'VE- REALLY A HIGHLIGHTED UNDERSCORE THE MESSAGE THAT LAW OLD ACTION TO ADDRESS THESE EPIDEMICS IS LONG OVERDUE AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO TOGETHER- MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN AND THAT WE WILL ADDRESS THESE EPIDEMICS AND MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS GET THE TREATMENT. AND INFORMATION THEY NEED TO- TO IMPROVE HEALTH FOR ALL IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH LESS GIVE MEMORIAL AROUND APPLAUSE AND THANK HER. WHAT OF PROVIDING GREAT INFORMATION SO AT THIS POINT TIME I WOULD ASK MY COLLEAGUES SHE HAS ANY QUESTIONS TO ADDRESS TO THIS PAD OR PREVIOUS PANELS WHO ARE STILL WITH USIN THE AUDIENCE AND THEN I WILL ASK A QUESTION THEY WOULD OPEN UP A PUBLIC COMMENTS SO AS YOU ARE THE THING ABOUT YOUR- QUESTION. THE GLAD YOU CAN PHONE IN THIS. THIS BECAUSE ME AFTER WE FINISH MAKE IT AND A ASKING OF THE PANEL WITH THAT WAS WHAT SOMETHING. THANK YOU IT'S BEEN IN. AND WHAT PART OF MY JUST IS IN THE A AND I WAS MENTION TO THE CHIU. THAT A CUP YEARS AGO I HAD A- THAT. SEND UP PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FOR SEVERAL DIFFERENT- THIS. ALL RIGHT IN BECAUSE OF BECAUSE SO I WAS JUST SAYING THAT I WAS LOOKING AT- POSSIBLY REINTRODUCING THAT AGAIN YOU KNOW IN LIGHT OF THE NEW GOVERNOR AND OTHER THINGS THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL BUT- THERE'S JUST SO MUCH THAT'S IMPORTANT I THINK THE THING THAT'S COME OUT CLEARLY IS THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO WORK IN A BIPARTISAN MANNER TO GET- THE FUNDING AVAILABLE IN THE COORDINATION WITH THE FRAMEWORK PUT TOGETHER BECAUSE THE TOOLS ARE THERE THE PEOPLE THERE THAT YOU KNOW. WE HAVE A LOT MORE KNOWLEDGE THAN WE DID YEARS AGO BROTHER IS- ON THE H. I. V. DOCTOR IN NEW YORK AND THE I LEARNED A LONG WHEN HE WAS A MEDICAL SCHOOL AND HIV WAS JUST COVERED BACK THAT IN THE A- ACTUALLY WASN'T WAS EIGHT OF TIME EN HE WOULD ADVOCATE FOR THE- AND I THINK PART OF ME TO MY TRYING ADVOCATE XIN CONFIRMS HIS WITH. IN. MISSION BERNIE TO THE LA. AND THE HOSPITAL. IN ABOUT. I DIDN'T KNOW. AND COME TO THE SOLUTION WE LOOK FORWARD TO FOR OUR PATIENTS SO THINKING. THANK YOU- THE BILLS THAT YOU HAD MADE MENTION OF- I WILL BE SIGNING ON AS A CO AUTHOR OF THOSE THOSE BILLS SO AGAIN- I'M HERE BECAUSE THE FIGHT IS HERE. AND WE'LL BE SUPPORTING MY COLLEAGUES- ON THOSE PARTICULAR LEVELS WITH THOSE BILLS MOVING FOR THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WITH THAT QUESTION FOR YOU WHAT CAN NOW ONLY YOU KNOW THE- SIGNING IN SCHOOL OFTEN IS BILLS WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE. I TO TRY TO HELP IN THIS FIGHT SO I PUT THAT TO OF THOSE WHO ARE HERE THE BUT I WAY I WAS SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THAT WE- DOCUMENTED SO WE CAN START LOOKING AT THE THOSE THESE WAYS I'M TRYING TO IS- A RESULT FROM THESE ISSUES YOU BROUGHT FORTH. TODAY SO WHAT WE'RE NOT DOING AS A LEGISLATURE THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. THAT'S THE QUESTION. FEEL FREE NOR I SPEAK A ONE TIME I'M JUST A DOCTOR BUT ALL. I'LL SAY THAT WHAT WE'RE I'VE SEEN AND LIFE TO IS THAT PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE HAS JUST BEEN UNDER FUNDED. FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS YOU KNOW MAYBE A YEAR AGO- ALL THE SUDDEN CHLAMYDIA BECAME A NON REPORTABLE DISEASE BECAUSE THERE'S JUST NOT RESOURCES TO FOLLOW IT UP ANYMORE SO. HEPATITIS C. AT THE COUNTY LEVEL IS NOT TRACKED REALLY AT ALL. FOR THE EXERCISE THAT WE HAD IN THE END HAVE SEE SAN DIEGO AT THE DEMOCRATS TO ACTUALLY SO STOKED THE COUNTY PEOPLE TO. EVEN PAY ATTENTION TO THIS. THEY'RE JUST NOT FUNDED- TO CONFRONT THESE EPIDEMICS LIKE THEY NEED TO BE IN SAN DIEGO THE- LARGE POPULATED COUNTY IMAGINE PLACES LIKE SISKIYOU COUNTY OR OTHER COMPANIES WITH WITH LESS INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE JUST AS IMPACTED BY THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. SO PROPERLY FUNDING OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS TO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO I THINK THIS IS A START LEGISLATURE KNOW. GREAT. OUR DID BREATH I THINK THAT THE YOU. YES THE CRISIS PARTICULAR IS WOLF ON FINANCE AND THE H. A. B. RESPOND TO THE- HAS FOR THE PART KEPT PACE. THE APPROPRIATIONS AT THE FEDERAL AND LEVEL WITH THE INCREASED DEMAND FOR SERVICES AND REGRETTABLY WE'VE GONE BACKWARDS WITH STDS WE'VE LOST POWER THE LAST DECADE AND A HALF. AND THERE'S BEEN EROSION OF STD CLINIC INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK THAT WAS HIGHLIGHTED A LITTLE BIT EARLIER AND WE HAVE- US- HE THIS MEASURE FOR CHLAMYDIA AND WE'RE STUCK AT FIGURE OUT A NEW APPROACH OR STRATEGY TO MAKE SURE THAT HEALTH PLANS ARE ARE IN FACT IT'S A PRIORITY- TO INCREASE YOU KNOW SEXUAL HEALTH PROGRAMMING. BOTH IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR BUT ALSO THE COMMERCIAL PLAN SECTOR- AND YOU KNOW THE SURPLUS EPIDEMIC WE CAN'T. THIS THE CA TIED THE CIVIL. IS EXT. CHALLENGING AND THE MANIFESTATIONS WE SEE IN WE HEAR ABOUT YOU KNOW BABIES EXPOSED TO SYPHILIS. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND AS LONG AS THERE'S A POOL OF INFECTIONS REFERENCE BEFORE. OF SYPHILIS AMMAN- WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE WE'RE GONNA SEE SURPLUS AMMAN- NEWBORNS. BUT WE HAVE TO GO ONE STEP FURTHER AS LONG AS WE HAVE A SURPLUS EPIDEMIC IN CALIFORNIA. AMONG MEN. THEIR HEAD OF SEXUAL AND BI SEXUAL THAT'S BURGEONING AND IT'S MULTIPLE FOLD HIGHER THAN THE EPIDEMIC AMONG WOMEN YOU CAN HAVE AN EPIDEMIC AMONG WOMEN. AND SO WE CAN'T JUST HAVE A ONE PROPER APPROACH TO SYPHILIS IT NEEDS TO BE MULTI PRONG. AND CIVIL CONTROL AMONG MEN YES IT WAS CONTROL AMONG WOMEN. AT THE NEWBORNS NEEDS TO BE. ABOUT GREAT THANK YOU. AND I WOULD JUST ADD YOU KNOW YOU HAVE VERY STRONG FROM WHERE YOU'RE PERCH TO AN YOU'RE SAID AND I THINK THAT WHILE THIS MIGHT WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE TO SHARE THIS AT THE TO. AND KIND OF BE THINKING ABOUT HOW WE KEEP PUTTING WIND BEHIND IT THIS SALE BECAUSE WE NEED TO GET TO THE FINISH LINE SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN INCREASE AWARENESS. WITH AND AMONG THE CAUGHT YOUR COLLEAGUES AND IN THE PUBLIC TO GET A MOVE A MOVEMENT YOU KNOW WE UNFORTUNATELY HAVE HAD- HISTORICALLY OVER TIME HAD TO HAVE A MOVEMENT AND- BECAUSE IT WAS A NOTE EPIDEMIC WAS. YOU KNOW HOW A DEVON IMPACT WE HAVE NOT A MOVEMENT OR CHAMPIONS FOR AS TV OR EIGHT CV AND NOW NOT THAT WE'RE FINALLY ALL COMING TOGETHER AND SAYING THAT THEY'RE ALL KIND OF LINKED I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO BE MORE VOCAL AND PRESENT AND UNITED THAN EVER SO ARE THERE OTHER HEARINGS WE'VE YOU KNOW BRING TOGETHER OTHER COXES WERE COMMITTEES THAT ARE HAVE REPRESENTS CAN SIT THESE ARE. I AM. IT I'M I. WALDRON AYE OF A OP ED THAT YOU WOULD PUT OUT AROUND AND ONE OF THE MEASURE THAT YOURS SO KIND KEEPING THE LEADERSHIP AND THE ATTHIS ISSUE OUT AND CENTER I THINK THROUGHOUT THE YEAR WOULD BE SOMETHING WE WOULD REALLY I BE HAPPY SUPPORT ANYWAY WE COULD GROUP THANK YOUR MUCH. THERE WAS ONE OF THE QUESTION- I THINK MISTER- BUT HAS TALKED ABOUT THE RYAN WHITE FIVE. AND YOU OR SOMEONE ARTICULATED THE POINT THAT THERE IS- IF YOU'RE IN THE RYAN WHITE FUND. YOU GOING TO DO WELL. AND THAT'S WHAT I HEARD- AND SO IF YOU'RE IN THIS FINE YOU DO WELL BUT WHAT OF. BOB THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT THERE. AND I ALSO HEARD THAT THOSE ARE THE CHALLENGES. THERE SO HOW DO WE BRIDGE THAT GAP. SERVE THE SO THE RYAN WHITE PROGRAM. WAS RATED BECAUSE IT'S FUNDED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND RESPONDS I MEAN IT IT BASICALLY WAS SET UP TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF HOW DO WE GET CARE TO PEOPLE WITH HIV RIGHT IT WAS CREATED THAT THE POINT THAT YOU KNOW WHICH PERCENT RIGHT PUSHING YOUR BROTHER LIKE HAVING TO PUSH. PUSH THAT THE- JOURNEY INTO THE HEART WAS SOME ELSE TRYING TO IT OUT RIGHT THAT WAS THE KIND OF ENVIRONMENT WHERE IT WAS DONE. AND IT'S HAD IT IT FOR WHATEVER. RIGHT I WAS. AS YOUNG AT THE POINT AT START. NOW NOT BUT RIGHT IT WAS SET UP WITH WITH MORE FLEXIBILITY THEN YOU SEE WITH A LOT OF UNDER FUNDING STREAMS AND SO. YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO FIND A LARGE VARIETY OF THANKS WITH THE RYAN WHITE PROGRAM AND WHAT IT'S MEANT IS THAT. IT IS REALLY CENTERED ON THIS IDEA OF WE'VE GOT TO GET THESE MEDICAL THESE HIV MEDICAL SERVICES TO PEOPLE BUT IF WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH TRANSPORTATION WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THESE OTHER THINGS WHAT WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE DEALING WITH THOSE THINGS WILL GET PEOPLE INTO. THE H. A. B. R. THAT'S OUR OUR REYES ON DEATH I WEEKS AND THERE'S- NO. A LOT OF IF ANY OTHER FOR. DREAM THAT I KNOW OF THAT FOR. THAT WAY. I CAL. PROGRAM THE. YOUR TYPICAL. ITS PLAN FOR. THE ARE FUNDED WITH THIRD THERE MAY. IS BORING SOME DIFFERENTLY AND SO. THERE THEY'RE ORIENTED A BOUND. LIE THIS IS THIS. THE WE CAN FOR AN EFFORT FOR OUT OF THIS BAR. WE CAN PAY FOR AND- SOAP CLINIC. STRONG WENT YOU KNOW WHEN WE- MEDICAID AND STATE ONE OF THE PERVERSE. FOR PEOPLE WITH HIV WAS. THAT SOME OF THEM LEFT THE RYAN WHITE SAYS. AND THEY WENT INTO THE MEDIC SYSTEM AND ALL THE SUN THERE WERE THESE KIND OF LAYERS OF ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS THAT THE- HADN'T. BEFORE SO AN EXAM WAS. YOU KNOW THE GUY ROLLED INTO MY- HOW THEY WERE PUT IN AND- A MAN. CARE IN MY CAL. BUT WE CARVE OUT OF THOSE MEN CARE PLANS. MENTAL HEALTH. AND SUBSTANCE SERVICE SINCE SO YOU'D PEOPLE. BEFORE GOT EVERYTHING IN ONE CLINIC BUT BECAUSE OF THE PARTICULAR. AREA THEY WERE IN AND OUT THE WAY THINGS WERE SET UP THEIR HEALTH PLAN. AT THIS POINT- OVER HERE FOR THE MEDICAL. THIS IS BUT THEN OVER THAT PER. OVER THERE. MENTAL ITS USE. YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY. BOUGHT A VULNERABILITY. THERE'S THE ACTUAL BUDGET. GET TO THIS. WE WALK CLINIC EIGHT. B. AND SO. IT'S THAT COMPREHENSIVENESS IN THE- THAT IT. BRANCH OF. THIS CALL WHEN IT'S SORT. WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO MAKE IT WORK. THIS PEDAL MORE TIME IF YOU WOULD PLEASE. GOING TO TRANSITION INTO PUBLIC COMMENTS YOU CAN PLEASE STAY RIGHT THERE YOU LIKE AS A MAYBE SOME COMMENTS- DIRECTED TOWARDS YOU SO AT THIS POINT IN TIME IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE A PUBLIC COMMENTS ON WHAT YOU'VE HEARD- THUS FAR WOULD YOU PLEASE COME TO THE MICROPHONE STATE YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION REPRESENTS- WILL HAVE ABOUT TWO MINUTES- BUT OF OR MINUTE A HALF RATHER- TO BE ABLE TO- US. WEIGH IN ON THIS CONVERSATION. SO MY NAME IS CARL GARDEN- I WORK MY COUSIN YOU GUYS. I WAS GOING TO MENTION THAT BUT I WORK WITH AN ORGANIZATION CALLED MEN TOUGH FOUNDATION OVERSEEING POLICY NOW BECAUSE HE BUT I DON'T COME WITH YOU WEARING THAT HAT- I'M A BLACK GAY MAN LIVING IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHO IS A PROVIDER BUT ALSO A CONSUMER- ON PRESS IN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I GET FROM. THE POSITION THAT WE HAD TODAY AND BEING OUT OF THE ORGANIZING COMMITTEE OF THE INNING THAT BUT DE MAKES. LAST I LET THE SOME OF THE WHOLE BE GREATER THAN ANY INDIVIDUAL PART IN IT SEEMS LIKE WHAT WE'RE ASKING. IS ALL THE SYSTEMS BEGIN TO WORK TOGETHER. TO FIGHT A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. THAT IS AFFECTED COMMUNITIES FAR. MORE HARDER THAN SHOULD BE AFTER SYNERGY- IS ALIGNMENT IT SEEMS LIKE WE ALL NEED TO BE GOING ON THIS I GOING. IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND FOR ME A LOT OF THE STUFF COMES SPIRITUAL- THE BIBLE SAYS BE NOT EQUALLY YOKED MAKE SURE YOU GUYS ARE GOING IN THE RIGHT. DIRECTION WHEN TWO PEOPLE COME TOGETHER IN A IN A COMMON COUGH NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE- AND THE LAST THING I THINK. IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT IS WE NEED TO BECOME PROACTIVE- IN FIGHTING THESE ASKED ENDEMIC TO SEEMS LIKE BEING A CONSUMER BEING A BLACK GAY MAN IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE ALWAYS PLAYING CATCH UP- TO- A LOT OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN ASSURING THE EXPERIENCE I HAD WITH YOU- TO GIVE YOU GUYS A FULL SCOPE. OF HOW PEOPLE ARE ENGAGED IN THEIR- I HAVE AN ACCOUNT ON A áP CALL JACK IN IT'S A SOCIAL SEXUAL NETWORKING APP BUT I TELL PEOPLE IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT PRESS. PLEASE LET ME KNOW AND THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN REACHED OUT TO ME AND THIS IS WHAT HE SAID. THANK. THREE REACHED OUT HE SAID A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT PREGNANT WOMEN GO AHEAD HE SAID I'M HPV POSITIVE ALONG WITH HIV POSITIVE WOODS PREP STILL BE A BENEFIT FOR ME AND I TOLD HIM UNFORTUNATELY NOT PURPOSE ONLY DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HIV NEGATIVE BUT I ASKED HIM IF HE'S ON TREATMENT HE RESPONDED I'M NOT AND I'M SCARED TO GET ON TREATMENT AS A RESULT OF DEATH I'M SO NERVOUS AND WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO ME HOWEVER I'M AWARE OF THE CONSEQUENCES IN NOT BEING TREATED. SOME HELP WITH THIS YOUNG MAN LEAVE THE CLINIC NOT FULLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT HIS TREATMENT OPTIONS WORK AND THE THING THAT HURTS ME MORE SO THAN ANY TITLE THAT I HAVE IN ANY STATISTIC I'M A NERD BY BY TRAINING I LESS THAT THEY LET SB BUT TO SOME EXTENT WHEN WE SEE HERE TALK ABOUT THESE NUMBERS THESE REPRESENT PEOPLE TO ME I HAVE FRIENDS WERE NO LONGER HERE ON THIS EARTH YOU GUYS HAVE. LAID OUT IN STATISTICS. BUT WHO'S WHO WHO'S WHO'S ADVOCATING FOR THEM- SO THAT'S WHAT I MEAN WE HAVE TO BE PROACTIVE. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE COUNTING ON US EVEN IF WE KNOW ORDER NOT TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISIONS FOR THEIR SEXUAL OUT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SANCTIONED BY THE END AND I WORK WITH AND PACKED GLOBAL ACTION FOR GAY MEN'S HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS. ARE IN A RUN THE IF YOU CAN'T AB AND PROGRAM THE FECA TO BE A PROGRAM. IS TRYING TO ADDRESS THE HIV CRISIS AMONG LIVE NEXT GAME BISEXUAL MEN. ARE NATIONALLY. WE ALSO BELONG TO. CALIFORNIA IN THE EPIDEMICS COALITION. AND OUR REALLY. AMAZED ABOUT- THE WONDERFUL SYNERGY THAT'S HAPPENING- WITHIN THAT COALITION. JUST WANTED TO ADDRESS- LIVE NEXT CAME MY SEXUAL MAN- BECAUSE- A LOT OF TIMES. THEY ARE NOT REPRESENTED AT THE TABLE OR THEY'RE NOT INVITED AT THE TABLE. OUR THEY'RE NOT MADE THE RESOURCES ARE NOT MADE AVAILABLE FOR THEM TO BE AT THE TABLE- IN THE OFFICE OF A TO SEE AN OFFICER WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE OFFICE OF AIDS IN NOVEMBER OF. TWENTY NINETEEN- RELEASED A REPORT THAT REALLY ARE KIND OF SOLIDIFIED WHAT WE WERE SEEING THE TRACKS THAT WE WERE SEEN. NATIONALLY AROUND AT NEW HIV INFECTIONS- NEAR HALF OF NEW PAYCHECK DIAGNOSIS ARE TRIBUTE TO. THE NEXT GAME BISEXUAL MAN. ANY 49% OF THE NEW- HIV DIAGNOSIS. ARE AMONG THIS. OF WE ARE. OVER REPRESENTED ASKED ME OF COLOR. WITH OUR BLACK AFRICAN AMERICAN GAME MAN AMONG ASIAN MEN AMONG NATIVE AND NATIVE GAY BISEXUAL MEN- EVEN EVEN AMONG THOSE MEN OUT A LOT OF A LOT IS UNKNOWN AND SO I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE THAT- ALTHOUGH WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS AMONG WHITE GAY AND BISEXUAL MEN AND GOOD FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN ORGAN NINETEEN AND THEY'VE BEEN PUSHING FOURTH. THAT IS NOT THE SAME CASE ARE IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR- IN SO AND IT HAS TO BE- VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT SO WE ARE MAKING OURSELVES AVAILABLE WITH SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT HAVE COME FROM NATIONALS LISTENING SESSIONS. FROM LENNIX GAME BISEXUAL MEN WHO ARE IN THE FOREFRONT WERE WORKING THE COMMUNITIES AND WHO ARE HAVING. WONDERFUL SUCCESSES IN ADDRESSING SOME OF THE DISPARITIES THEY'RE ASKING OUR COMMUNITIES THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M LARA THOMAS AND THE DOCTOR FROM REDUCTION POLICY THE SAN FRANCISCO AIDS FOUNDATION AND THANK YOU. FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING BUT I WANT TO ADD ANOTHER POLICYOPTION AND PIECE OF LEGISLATION INTO THIS- ASSEMBLY BILL THREE SIX TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER- EGGMAN- WOULD ALLOW THE SITTING COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO TO OFFER OVERDOSE PREVENTION SERVICES ALSO KNOWN AS SUPERVISED CONSUMPTION. SITES AND ONE OF THE REASONS AMONG THE REASONS THAT SAN FRANCISCO WANTS TO OPEN THE IS BECAUSE OF THE ROLE THAT THEY CAN PLAY IN PREVENTING HIV TRANSMISSIONS AND HEPATITIS C. TRANSMISSIONS AMONG PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS. AS WELL AS CREATING OPPORTUNITY TO LINK PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS TO ADDITIONAL SERVICES INCLUDING SEXUAL HEALTH AND STI TESTING THE- A STUDY IN SAN FRANCISCO LOOKING AT THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROGRAMS FOUND THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF HIM FOR THE PROGRAMS IN SAN FRANCISCO IN IT WOULD SAVE US MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. WHERE WE ALLOWED TO OPEN THEM IS BECAUSE OF THE ABILITY TO PREVENT BILL HIV INFECTIONS AND PREVENT NEW HEPATITIS C. INFECTIONS AS WE'VE HEARD REPEATEDLY HERE PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS. ARE ARE ARE AMONG THE FOLKS MOST VULNERABLE TO- HIV TRANSMISSION TO HEPATITIS C. TRANSMISSION AS WELL AS TO SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE KNOW WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT SYPHILIS AND CONGENITAL SERVE AS AT. IS INFERENCE AND I KNOW PART OF THIS MUCH OF THAT IS RELATED. METHAMPHETAMINE USE ON THE PART OF WOMEN AND SO BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THESE TYPES OF SUPERVISED CONCEPTIONS ARE HAS WHERE PEOPLE ARE WELCOME IN- PROVIDED WITH NON JUDGMENTAL CARE IN A LOW THRESHOLD HARMON. OR IN AND- SEC PART OF WHY YOU NOW. TO A BRAT I YOU. THE UP MAYBE TEN AND HAVE IT IS TRANSMISSION AND ACTUALLY AND INFECTIONS AND SO I ENCOURAGE AS WE THINK ABOUT. WHAT IS NEED IN THE STATE OF. IN ORDER TO FULLY GET TO ZERO AND FULLY AND HEPATITIS C. AND ELIMINATE THESE STI EPIDEMICS AS WELL THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT SUPERVISE CONSUMPTION SITES AN OVERDOSE PREVENTION SERVICE SAYS. SUCH AS ENVISIONED IN AB THREE SIX TWO ARE ON THE TABLE AS PART OF THE SOLUTION. THANK YOU THANK YOU. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MICHELLE GIVENS WITH THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE AND AT FIRST AND FOREMOST LET ME JUST THANK YOU ALL FOR A FOR HOSTING THIS HEARING IT'S GREAT TO BE IN A ROOM FULL OF FOLKS AT ALL WANT TO. TACKLE AND ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE REALLY A CRITICAL PARTNER AND THAT AND WANT TO CONTINUE TO JOIN IN THAT EFFORT. AND I THINK IT TO YOUR POINT AROUND WHAT CAN WE DO ACT IT'S NO THAT TO THE STATEMENT THAT WAS MADE EARLIER AROUND PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. I DON'T KNOW THAT FOLKS ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS BUT THERE ARE SPECIALIZED CLASSIFICATIONS TRAINING SKILL SETS OF THINGS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN IN TERMS OF STAFFING CAPACITY. SO EPIDEMIOLOGIST THAT LOOK AT DATA TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE HOT SPOTS ARE AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO TARGET RESOURCES- IT DISEASE INVESTIGATORS THAT NEED TO KNOW HOW TO APPROACH INDIVIDUALS AND HOW TO ASK FOR THEIR HISTORY AND HOW TO ADDRESS PARTNER SERVICES AND SO FORTH. THERE ARE A LOT OF PARTICULAR SKILL SETS THAT OUR HOUSE WITHIN PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND YET WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LIKE HEALTH CARE LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAMS PUBLIC IS NEVER A PART OF THAT COVERS IN SAID. FIRST AND FOREMOST FROM A INFRASTRUCTURE THE POINT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD JUST MENTION IS JUST THAT THE- OVER FOR AND FOR. ABOUT DIFFERENT AN I'M WITH OFF. WITH A LOT OUR COMMUNITY OR PATIENT BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE THE- TO RESPOND IT. THREATS A SLEIGH AS H. I. OTHER THINGS UP ON IT. I'LL SING THE RATES OF STDS AND OTHER DISEASES INCREASE AND SO THIS LETS US KNOW THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A GREATER PARTNERSHIP AND SYNERGY AND WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE MORE PRESSING ISSUES AT HAND. JUST AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY A- NICE AND HOUSE ABILITY. AT ALL CONTRIBUTING CROESUS TV RATE. WE ARE SUPPORT OF A LOT OF THOSE THAT YOU'RE HEARD. FROM AND THAT. I SHOULD WE ALSO AT AS WAS MENTIONED ARE GONNA BE PUTTING FORWARD ANOTHER PROPOSAL TO COMPLEMENT THAT WHICH WOULD BE. S. T. E. NAVIGATOR THIS IS SO BEING ABLE TO DO THAT HEALTH. ASSESSMENT OF AN END OF WILL TO SAY OKAY. I BE. SUPPORT TO MAKE THAT CONNECTION YOU NEED TO HAVE YOUR X. HOUSING IS DOUBLE IN THIS IS AN IS OR IT'S HOW. LET'S GO AHEAD AND ADDRESS THE ARE YOU HAVE TO. ISSUES LET'S SEE WHAT WE DO TO ADDRESS. A GATOR. PROTEST IN A CUP OF THE- S. AGE MAY GROUPS THAT. CS OFFERING ONE OTHER THING THAT I'VE YOU. CONSTANTLY AS EXAMPLE IS ASKED D.'S. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT RATES ARE IN. AS YOU HEARD COLLEAGUE GOT A KERN COUNTY THE MEDIC HOW BIRTH. AND YOU WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO. COMPLEMENT THE MEDIC HEALTH. BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT SYNERGY. WHAT THESE BIG ISSUES ARE IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE MEDI CAL SPACE. MEDICAL SERVES A THIRD OF OUR POPULATION WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO CONNECT THOSE TWO. AND SO FROM MY STANDPOINT ONE THING THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL IS FOR SOME ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. THEY HAVE WHAT'S CALLED IT CAN'T CASE MANAGEMENT. THIS IS GONNA BE FOR THOSE WITH LIKE THAT THE MOST CHRONIC CONDITIONS THOSE THAT ARE CREATING HOSPITALIZATIONS. BUT THERE SHOULD ALSO BE A TARGETED APPROACH FOR STDS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE RATES ARE SO ARE CLIMBING SO RAPIDLY. AND SO WHAT CAN WE DO TO ENSURE THAT THAT IS A PIECE S. T. WAITED ANGST ALL HEALTH. AS THE EMPLOYMENT IS PROPOSED SO THESE. A FEW STRATEGIES I BEFORE YOU AND APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. INCHES IN SOME SOLUTIONS THAT WE HAVE- I'M SORRY I'M AND DONNELLY WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO AIDS FOUNDATION ALSO AND THE EPIDEMICS COALITION. WANT TO BUILD A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT THE SHELL BROUGHT UP ACTUALLY BECAUSE I ALSO SIT IN- THE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT GROUP. OF HEALTH HERE WHAT IS IT MEDI CAL HEALTHIER CALIFORNIA FOR ALL NOW. AND I THINK DOCTOR. MARK TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THIS IN. ENHANCE CASE COORDINATION- IN SOME OF THE OTHER ASPIRATIONAL GOALS WHICH WE FULL SUPPORT OF THIS PROCESS. AND BECAUSE MEDI CAL DOES COVER ONE THIRD OF OUR POPULATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA THESE ARE GOING TO BE REALLY BROUGHT AND THEY'RE NOT. ACTUALLY GOING TO BE TARGETED AT THIS POINT. TO MOST OF THE FOLKS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. SO BUILDING ON WHAT MICHELLE SAID WE HAVE BEEN SUGGESTING IS COMMUNITY WOULD LOVE ANY ENCOURAGEMENT THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET TO DH CS. TO CONSIDER A FORMAL AND STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THAT WOULD ACTUALLY FOCUS ON THESE THE ENDEMIC THE- THREE AT. MAKES IT REALLY. WAY WE WILL FOR ME. OPPORTUNITY NOW. SAM THE HOT SPOKE. THE IN ORDER SERVER FOLKS WHO ARE USING DRUG I'M IN THE PROJECT THERE IS TEST FOR BOTH HIV AND H. SO WE'RE ON AS TO HAPPENED WITH LINKAGE TO AND RETENTION IN CARE IN THIS PROGRAM SO WE'RE WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE CAN REALLY LEVERAGE IF WE SIMPLY HAD A STRATEGIC APPROACH AND WE HAD A COLLABORATION PARTNERSHIP SO THANK YOU. I DON'T THINK. PRISON I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUICK MINUTES AGO ABOUT WHAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO- ROBIN LEARNING AGAIN FROM. I'M ACTUALLY FREE AGENT RIGHT NOW SO I'M JUST HERE REPRESENTING HARM REDUCTION. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE OUR LEGISLATURE TAKE MORE OF A LEAD IN ENCOURAGING. COUNTIES IN THE STATE TO SUPPORT LOCAL SYRINGE EXCHANGES. THIS IS CALIFORNIA THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR COUNTIES LIKE SAN DIEGO OR ORANGE TO ACTIVELY FIGHT THE PROVEN EFFECTIVE. INTERVENTION LIKE SYRINGE SERVICES. THANK YOU KNOW THANK YOU.
