FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE HR TEN. KAKORI HOUSE RESOLUTION TEN BY SUMMER CALDERONE RELATIVE TO WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. MEMBERS. PLEASE GIVE YOUR ATTENTION TO MISTER CALDERON. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO PREVENT HR TEN COMMEMORATING THE FORTY EIGHTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DECISION IN ROE V. WADE AFFIRMING EVERY WOMAN HAS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO CONTROL HER OWN REPRODUCTIVE DECISIONS. AND WHETHER TO CONTINUE A PREGNANCY OR OBTAIN AN ABORTION. ROVI WITH A VICTORY FOR WOMEN TO TELL THEIR OWN BODIES. AND LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR FURTHER REPRODUCTIVE AND SEXUAL HEALTH CARE POLICIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. IT IS VITAL FOR CALIFORNIA WHICH IS HOME TO NEARLY TWENTY MILLION WOMEN. TO RECOGNIZE AND CELEBRATE THESE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. ESPECIALLY DURING A TIME WHEN PROVIDERS OF REPRODUCTIVE AND SEXUAL HEALTH CARE LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD ARE UNDER SERIOUS UNRELENTING ATTACKS. FOR PROVIDING SAFE AND LEGAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. DESPITE THE SUPPORT AND THE NEW FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION THE RIGHT TO LEGAL ABORTION IS INCREASINGLY BECOMING A RIDE IN NAME ALONE. SIX STATES HAVE ONLY ONE REMAINING ABORTION CLINIC AND 90% OF US COUNTIES INCLUDING 40% OF CALIFORNIA COUNTIES DO NOT HAVE AN ABORTION PROVIDER. WITH THE CHANGE IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE SUPREME COURT INCLUDING AMY CONEY BARRETT'S CONFRONT CONFIRMATION TO THE COURT AND TWENTY TWENTY. ABORTION ACCESS IS AT EXTREME RISK. RIGHT NOW THERE ARE NINETEEN CASES ADDRESSING ABORTION RIGHTS ONLY ONE STEP AWAY FROM THE SUPREME COURT. MANY RODE THE WAVE COULD BE OVERTURNED- FURTHER THAT IT. ELIMINATING WHAT LITTLE ACCESS IS LEFT ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. HR TEN SOLIDIFIES THE ASSEMBLY SUPPORT AND COMMITMENT TO PROTECT A WOMAN'S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO DECIDE. IF AND WHEN THEY BECOME A PARENT. AS WE MARK ROBEY WEIGHTS FORTY EIGHT ANNIVERSARY. NOW MORE THAN EVER. WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE LEGAL RIGHT TO ABORTION ISN'T ENOUGH. WE NEED TO EXPAND ACCESS OF THAT REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM IS A REALITY FOR EVERY PERSON. WE MUST URGE THE BIDEN MINISTRATION TO FIGHT BACK AND UNDO THE HARPER TRUMPCARE POLICIES. AND CONTINUE TO EXPAND ACCESS TO ABORTION AND SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE IN CALIFORNIA. I LIKE MANY VIEW STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF A WOMAN'S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AS CONFIRMED IN ROE V. WADE. TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS REGARDING THEIR PREGNANCY AND- JR AYE VOTE ON HR. TEN THANK YOU MISTER CALDERON. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. MS AGUIAR-CURRY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED HEY GOOD MORNING MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF HR TEN WHICH RECOGNIZES THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OF EVERY WOMAN TO CONTROL THEIR OWN REFERENCE REPRODUCTIVE DECISIONS INCLUDING THE INTIMATE CHOICE TO CONTINUE YOUR PREGNANCY OR OBTAIN ABORTION. OF CALIFORNIA LEADERS EVEN VOTE FOR THIS DEVASTATING EPIDEMIC WE HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND THE IMPORTANCE OF LIFESAVING ACCESS TO PERSONALIZED WHOLE PERSON HEALTH CARE. JUST YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE PRESIDENT BIDEN TOOK AN OATH TO SERVE BY UNITING OUR NATION AND UPLIFTING ALL AMERICANS FROM THE UNIMAGINABLE LOSS. DEVASTATION AND DIVISION FELL OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS AND ACUTELY OVER THE COURSE OF THE ONGOING COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. IT IS OUR DUTY TO PROTECT AND EXPAND NOT TAKE AWAY ACCESS TO ALL FORMS OF HEALTH CARE.
