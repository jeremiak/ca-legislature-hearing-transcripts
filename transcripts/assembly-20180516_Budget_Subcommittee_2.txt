WE WILL AT THE END IS GOOD MORNING WILL BEGIN TODAY'S. ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE EDUCATION FINANCE. ON HIGHER EDUCATION PROPOSALS FROM THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION FIRST LET'S CALL THE ROLL. MCCARTY HERE. MEDINA HERE. O'DONNELL. VOEPEL. QUORUM IS ESTABLISHED. OKAY SO TODAY ç²’ THE PROPOSALS FROM. THE GOVERNOR. WILL BE TAKING THE ACTIONS TODAY THAT WOULD BE. LATER. NEXT WEEK ACTUALLY. SO WITH THAT WE WILL BEGIN WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE WITH OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE PROPOSED REVISIONS TO THE ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROPOSAL OKAY PLEASE BEGIN. A GOOD MORNING RATES THAT WOULD KEY SAT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I HAD THE ME REVISION MAKE SEVERAL CLARIFICATIONS AND CHANGES TO THE ONLINE COLLEGE PROPOSAL IN RESPONSE TO A FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE RECEIVED SO ALL FOCUS MY REMARKS ON THE VARIOUS CHANGES. THE MAYOR MEASURE PROPOSES SEVERAL AYE CHANGES RELATED TO THE COLLEGE'S GOVERNANCE AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. OUT WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT THAT UP PROCESS FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. SO THE MAY REVISION TRAILER BILL ENSURES THAT FACULTY AND CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES OF THE COLLEGE WOULD BE REPRESENTED FOR PURPOSES OF A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. AND TO ACCOMPLISH THIS THE ONLY COLLEGE FOR PARTNER WITH AN EXISTING DISTRICT OUT FOR THE PURPOSES OF ESTABLISHING THAT AGREEMENT. INSTEAD OF CREATING A NEW INDEPENDENT BOARD UNDER ANY DISTRICT UNDER THE MAYOR VISION PROPOSAL THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS WOULD SERVE AS THE GOVERNING BOARD OF THE ONLINE COLLEGE. TE CHANCELLOR AND THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS WHICH IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE ONLY COLLEGE AND THE COLLEGE'S PRESIDENT'S WOULD MANAGE AND CONTROL THE OPERATIONS OF THE COLLEGE. I HAD THE PRESIDENT OF THE COLLEGE WOULD ALSO ESTABLISH AN ADVISORY COUNCIL WHICH WOULD INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES FROM LOCAL TRUSTEES AND EMPLOYEES OF THE COLLEGE TO ADVISE HIM OR HER ON ISSUES RELATED TO THE COLLEGE. THE MAYOR VISION ALSO. INCLUDES PROVISIONS RELATED TO STUDENT OUTCOMES AND STUDENT PROTECTIONS THIS INCLUDES REQUIRING THE COLLEGE TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT IN ITS THIRD YEAR OPERATION ON STUDENT OUTCOMES. INCLUDING STUDENT EMPLOYMENT EARNING GAINS AFTER COMPLETION OF PROGRAMS AND OTHER SUCCESS METRICS IDENTIFIED BY THE BY THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT UNIT OF THE COLLEGE. AS WELL AS A DESCRIPTION OF THE COLLEGES PROGRESS ARE REACHING WORKING ADULTS. ADDITIONALLY THE COLLEGE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SHARE PROMISING PRACTICES AND PROCESS HE'S WITH THE OTHER COMMUNICATIVE DRESS. AND THE MAYOR VISION ALSO ADDS PROVISIONS TO REQUIRE THE COLLEGE TO COMPLY WITH DISABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS TO DEVELOP A PROCESS FOR RECORDING AND ADDRESSING COMPLAINTS AND REPORTING BACK. ON COMPLAINTS WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS. IN RESPONSE TO CONCERNS ABOUT ACCREDITATION THE MAYOR REVISION CLARIFIES THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE ONLY COLLEGE WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR COMMAND SEEM BE. ACCREDITATION PROCESS IMMEDIATELY UPON ENROLLMENT OF. BECAUSE THE COLLEGE'S FIRST COHORT OF STUDENTS. WE'VE HEARD CONCERNS ABOUT THAT INTERIM PERIOD WHILE THE COLLEGE IS SEEKING ACCREDITATION EYES OF THE MAYOR OF EVENTS AT SOME ADDITIONAL. PROTECTIONS WHILE THE COLLEGE IS SEEKING ACCREDITATION THE WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARD AND THE COMPLAIN EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT WILL DETERMINE WHETHER THE PROGRAMS OFFERED BY THE ONLY COLLEGE HAD JOB MARKET VALUE TO CALIFORNIA INDUSTRIES. THE PROPOSED COLLEGE ALSO DIRECTS THE COLLEGE AT EXCUSE ME THAT PROPOSED LANGUAGE ALSO DIRECTS THE COLLEGE TO EXPLORE PROCESS FOR ALLOWING STUDENTS. WHO ATTEND THE COLLEGE WHILE THE COLLEGE IS SEEKING ACCREDITATION TO OBTAIN CREDITS AFTER THE COLLEGE BECOMES ACCREDITED? IN THE AREA OF CURRICULUM THAT MAYOR VISION PROPOSES LANGUAGE THAT CLARIFIES THAT CURRICULUM DEVELOPED BY THE COLLEGE AND ITS FACULTY WOULD HAVE THE SAME ACADEMIC PROTECTIONS GRANTED TO THAT CURRICULA DEVELOPED BY OTHER. ALCHEMY COLLEGE FACULTY. AND THE PROPOSED A TRAILER BILL ALSO CLARIFIES THE INTENT OF THE ONLY COLLEGE TO CREATE UNIQUE CONTENT AND DELIVER IT IN A MANNER THAT IT'S NOT DUPLICATIVE OF THE PROGRAMS OFFERED. BY OTHER AT LOCAL COLLEGES I THINK YOU I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU ALEJO. A GROUP ROLE WITH THE LEADS THAT AMOUNT THOUGHT FIFTH. WE HAVE. THE SAME CONCERNS THAT WE HAD WITH THE ORIGINAL JANUARY PROPOSAL I'M HAVING FUNDAMENTALLY OUR CONCERNS ARE THAT THE. THE AND THE PROPOSAL THAT MISTRESS INTO THAT IDENTIFY SPECIFIC PROBLEMS WITHIN THE EXISTING COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM THAT'S PREVENTING THEM WORKING ADULTS FROM ECHO THING THESE PROGRAMS. AND IT DOESN'T CLARIFY HOW THE NEW COMMUNITY COLLEGE WITH THE NEW ON MY COMMITTEE BECAUSE WHAT EXIT DRAFT THE SPECIFIC BARRIERS THAT EXIST FOR WORKING ADULTS. SO WE WOULD LIKE OUR RECOMMEND REJECTING THE PROPOSAL AND. I'M IF YOU ARE INTERESTED WE DO THINK THAT WE GROWTH ADMINISTRATION THAT THE THINGS THEY. THAT WORKING ABOUT THE DON'T HAVE POST SECONDARY OUR CREDENTIALS ARE A A GROUP THAT CAN BE ECONOMICALLY VULNERABLE AND. DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR THAT FOR THAT PARTICULAR GROUP I'M A IS IT SOMETHING GOOD AND THAT SHOULD BE EXPLORED BY WE JUST THINK YOU CAN EXPLORE THOSE OPTIONS THROUGH TIME MAKING OTHER SYSTEM MIGHT IMPROVEMENTS THAT DON'T INVOLVE CREATING AND ON THE COLLEGE. AND CHRISTMAS WHEN YOU THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WE REMAIN SUPPORTIVE OF THE ONLINE COLLEGE WE THINK THAT BE ABOUT THE CHANGES THAT THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. SCRIBE A RESPONDED MUCH OF THE FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE HEARD OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS FROM OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS FROM OUR CONSULTATION COUNSELING FROM OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. I THINK THE TWO MOST PROMINENT. PIECES OF FEEDBACK WE HEARD FOR MANY WERE. AROUND GOVERNMENTS AROUND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WE THINK A YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO EFFECTIVE PUBLIC GOVERNANCE WE'VE BEEN COMMITTED TO A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WE THINK THE TRAILER BILL REFLECTS OF BOTH OF THOSE I COMMITMENTS. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY WELL ABOVE QUESTIONS. MR MEDINA WOULD LIKE TO START. THE QUESTION. HOW HOW DOES THE MAY REVISE? GOVERNANCE OF THE ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT FROM THE. INITIAL PROPOSAL. AS SO UNDER THE INITIAL PROPOSAL AND A NEW DISTRICT WOULD BE CREATED WITH THE NEW INDEPENDENT GOVERNING BOARD OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS WHAT'S THAT. WOULD SERVE AS THE INTERIM. BOARD UNTIL THE AND YOU INDEPENDENT BOARD IS A POINT AND I'M UNDER THAT UNDER THE MAYOR VISION PROPOSAL THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS WOULD SERVE AS AT. THE GOVERNING BOARD OF THE ONLINE COLLEGE. SO THAT THAT'S STILL A NEW. COLLEGE THEN IT'S A NEW DISTRICT IT'S STILL A NEW DISTRICT THAT. CORRECT IT WOULD BE AND IT WOULD BE NEW COLLEGE. AND FOR PURPOSES OF THE STATUTE WE WOULD DEFINE AT THE COLLEGE ALLIES AT A DISTRICT AS WELL. IT WOULDN'T SEEK ACCREDITATION. IT WOULD SEEK ACCREDITATION OKAY I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING HOW THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE INITIAL PROPOSAL. AT THE THOSE GOVERNING BOARD. WOULD BE THAT PORTER GOVERNOR'S RIGHT MOVING FORWARD. I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE INITIAL PROPOSAL. THAT THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OUT WOULD SERVE IN AN INTERIM ROLE UNTIL AN APPOINTMENT UP AT SEPARATE BOARD OUT WOULD BE AND UP APPOINTED AND OTHER HIGHER VERSION THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS WAS GONNA POINT ANOTHER BOARD. AND NOW THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS WOULD RUN THIS ON MY COLLEAGUES ARE SAYING AND AT CORRECT THAT THERE WAS. AT STATUE THAT'S BY THE BY THE THE APPOINTMENT OF. THAT THAT THE NEW INDEPENDENT BOARD AND NOW THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS WHICH TO SERVE AS. BUT NOT NOT NOT AS AN INTERIM BUT INDEFINITE CORRECT. IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING GOING TO A DISTRICT WHOSE GOVERNOR BOARD. IS NOT ELECTED. CHRIS ORGASM APPLYING THE WITH FINANCE WE BELIEVE THAT. THE STRUCTURE OF THE TRAILER BILL WITH SUCH THAT THIS COLLEGE WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR PROPOSITION NINETY. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNING BOARD IS NOT ELECTED. YES. WE BELIEVE THAT WE. WHAT IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO IS THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS IT'S PART OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM WHICH IS PART OF THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM? ROOM YES MISTER VOEPEL. YES RIGHT NOW YOU'RE SET UP FOR I. T. CREDENTIAL IN MEDICAL CODING CREDENTIAL. NOW. I MAY BE PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE HERE BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER CREDENTIALS IN MIND FOR THE FUTURE. SO EVEN WORKING OVER THE PAST FOUR MONTHS SINCE BUT GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WAS RELEASED TO KIND OF EVALUATE A SITE OF. CREDENTIALS THAT WOULD BE OFFERED UP YOU KNOW OUR. PURPOSE OR YOU KNOW THAT THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING HAS BEEN DO IDENTIFY SOME DESIGN PRINCIPLES. BANG CLEARED OFFERING AREAS OFFERING CREDENTIALS IN AREAS WHERE THERE'S A. THE EXPECTATIONS OF EMPLOYMENT GROWTH WHERE FOLKS CAN SEE. EARNINGS GAINS WORK AND AND I THINK IMPORTANTLY WHERE ARE WE DON'T SEE DUPLICATION IN THE COLLEGES TODAY AND SO ARE THOSE OF THE TWO WE'VE IDENTIFIED IF THIS PROPOSAL IS APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE. OUT WE HAVE A SET OF OTHERS. BUT I THINK WE'RE STILL VETTING I THINK THE COMMITMENT WE HAVE CONSISTENT AT THE TRAILER BILLS THAT WE WOULD OFFER THREE PROGRAMS BEGINNING IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THANK YOU USER. OKAY MISTER O'DONNELL. YES THANK YOU I'M THINKING APPRECIATE SOME THE CHANGES THAT ARE MADE HERE. AGAIN JUST TO CLARIFY THIS OP COLLEGE WOULD SPECIFICALLY THAT HE SAID ABOUT THE MISSION OF. OF PROVIDING. SKILLS RIGHT TO CLOSE MAYBE SOME SKILL GAPS IT'S NOT TO OFFER GENERAL EDUCATION. COURSES. THAT'S CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT RATE I'M. SO IT IS. IN THIS CAN BE LIKE A ONE STOP SHOP. WHERE YOU HAVE GO? AND. TAKE AN ONLINE CLASS IS THAT CORRECT. I'VE THE ONLY COLLEGE WOULD DESIGN A SPECIFIC. A CREDENTIAL PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE MEDICAL CODEINE AND THE IT SUPPORT. FOCUS ON SPECIFIC. INDUSTRY AT NEED SO THAT WOULD BE FOCUS SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS I DON'T THINK ANYONE SUPPOSED TO. CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS OR DRESSING. REALLY ECONOMIC NEEDS ACROSS THE STATE WITH YOU KNOW PROVIDING INDIVIDUALS MORE SKILLS. SO THIS DE IN THE IDEAS THAT YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE IDEAS NOW CONCEPTS WHERE YOU'D GO WITH THIS BUT THAT IT WOULD EXPAND OVER TIME. THAT KIND OF VISION. RIGHT I THINK THERE'S A TIME FRAME WHERE AT THE COLLEGE WOULD INITIALLY DEVELOP THREE PATHWAYS AND THEN THREE ADDITIONAL PATHWAYS THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND AGAIN THESE ARE SHORT TERM. CREDENTIALS AT THAT LEAD TO A PROMOTION AND OR WAGE GAINS SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES BUT THE IDEA IS THAT THE COLLEGE WOULD CONTINUE TO. ADD DEVELOP AT PROGRAMS AND DESIGNED AROUND SPECIFIC. WORK FOURS AT NEEDS AND CLOSING ECONOMIC GAPS. THIS IS ONE PLACE YOU GO TO. TO TAKE CLASSES TO. THERE. GAIN THOSE NECESSARY SKILLS. SO SO I GOT ALL I JUST STRUGGLE THIS LITTLE BIT IS. DO DO WE HAVE THOSE CLASSES NOW ACROSS THE STATE. COLLEGES NOW OFFER THOSE CLASSES. I AM SO A COUPLE OF OF AND AREAS WHERE THIS COLLEGES WHAT WILL BE DIFFERENT HAD THEN THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. I'M OF THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES THE ON MY COLLEGE WOULD DEVELOP I'M PROGRAMS WITH THEIRS AND NEED. WHERE? WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE IS A POSSIBILITY FOR I'M INDIVIDUALS TO BE ABLE TO PROMOTE AND INCREASE THEIR WAGE GAIN AWARE THAT NEED AS AN BEING AT MATT'S. THAT COLLEGE WOULD ALSO DEVELOP COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION. AND OFFER AND COURSES THAT ARE NIGHT TIED TO THE TYPICAL ACADEMIC AND CALENDAR STILL AND THE DESIGN. OF OF THESE PROGRAMS WILL BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AND WE DID ADD SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IN THE TRAILER BILL TO ENSURE THAT I LESSONS LEARNED IT BY. THE COLLEGE WOULD BE SHARED ACROSS THE OTHER COMMITTEE COLLEGES ON HOW TO BEST SERVE OUT WORKING ADULTS THAT ARE. CURRENTLY ATTENDING AND THICK THE TRADITIONAL COMMUNITY THIS. SIDE I DON'T OPPOSE THE GO THE GOAL. I'M JUST A LITTLE CONFUSED ON WHY THIS IS THE WAY TO GET THERE WE HAVE ALL THESE COLLEGES ACROSS THE STATE. WHY WOULDN'T WE CREATE A ONE STOP SHOP A ONE IN A ONE ONE WEBSITE? THAT WOULD HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT CLASSES LISTA BECAUSE THERE'S DIFFERENT SCHOOLS SKITS SKILLSETS ACROSS OUR STATE DINNER REGION'S THAT NEED DIFFERENT SKILL SETS. SO SO HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHY YOU JUST WOULDN'T. HAVE THESE COLLEGES DEVELOP THESE NOW OR EVEN IF THEY OFFER THEM NOW. AND HAVE THEM COLLECTED ON ONE WEBSITE ARE THE ON ONE WEBSITE NOW. HELP ME I DON'T UNDER I DON'T KNOW SEVEN SAY IN GENERAL. WE ARE TARGETING AREAS WHERE. COLLEGE ME COLLEGES MAY OFFER SIMILAR PROGRAMS I THINK IT'S FINANCE INDICATED. COLLEGES AREN'T OFFERING THESE PROGRAMS IN A COMPETENCY BASED FORMAT I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS PROPOSAL WE THINK. CAN WE THINK IT HELPS REDUCE THE FRICTION THAT STUDENTS NEED. THAT STUDENTS OFTEN FACE AND I IN ORDER TO GET ACCESS TO THE PROGRAMS THAT LEAD TO WAGE GAINS IN EMPLOYMENT. I THINK IN GENERAL THE SCALE ISN'T THERE I THINK YOU KNOW CHANCELLOR OAKLEY HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT THE. GOAL OF THIS IN PART IS TO CREATE AN INSTITUTION THAT CAN DELIVER INSTRUCTION AT SCALE TO STUDENTS TO. A CAN OF STRANDED WORKERS WERE FACING THIS NEED SO I THINK. YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE SKILLED A DAY. I THINK A QUESTION IS COULD YOU BUILD SCALE AND THE EXISTING COLLEGES WE THINK BE APPROACH IS PREFERABLE TO BUILD IT IN A NEW COLLEGE WHERE YOU CAN DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY AROUND THE NEEDS OF THE USE THAT BUT THIS POPULATION OF LEARNERS. CURRENT. AMERICA WOULD JUST HAVE A BIG PROBLEM ASSEMBLY MEMBER DONNA YOUR QUESTION THE BIGGER PART OF WHAT I THINK WE FEE OF A. A DIFFICULT PATH PART OF EVALUATING THE PROPOSALS THAT A LOT OF THINGS HERE AND DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU THINK OF THE MORE IMPORTANT GOAL YOU WOULD TAKE TO A DIFFERENT APPROACH SO. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING IS CAN WE. FIND A BETTER WAY TO SORT OF COLLECT ONLINE PROGRAM TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR STUDENTS TO ENROLL IN THESE PROGRAMS ALL ACROSS THE STATE. BECAUSE YOU'RE CORRECT THAT THERE ARE ONLY ON LIKE. COURSES ALL ALL ACROSS THE STATE ENTIRE PROGRAMS MIGHT NOT BE ONLINE THEY'RE AVAILABLE WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT DOES THAT. THAT IS NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY BECAUSE IT IT WERE STILL REQUIRES INDIVIDUAL COLLEGES ARE DISTRICTS TAXI BUT YOU CAN GO ONLINE FIND OF COURSE CLICK ON AND YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE COLLEGE TO. A SUBMIT SUBMIT INFORMATION TO YOU CAN VERIFY YOUR ENROLLMENT AND IN GENERAL YOU CAN JUST SEEM IF WE DO THAT. IF WE CREATE THAT ON MY COLLEGE DOES NOT GONNA PICK THEM EVENT THAT'S GOING TO CREATE ANOTHER WEBSITE WHERE YOU CAN GO TO FIND THE PROGRAM SO IF THAT'S THE GOAL THAT'S ONE ASPECT. THAT THAT THE WAY THIS PROPOSAL HAS BEEN ITS THIRD MORE ABOUT IF NOT ABOUT THAT ITS ABOUT WORKING ADULTS AGE WHO WHO NEED ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS. THAT YOU MIGHT THINK IT'S WHOLLY DIFFERENT APPROACH YOU MIGHT THINK OKAY WELL WE WE REALLY WANT A COMPETENCY BASED PROGRAM LET'S FOCUS ON THAT LET'S. FIGURE HOW TO DO THAT I THINK WE WOULD SAY IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT. YOU WANT IT YOU MIGHT WANT FOR MORE OPTIONS THAN JUST CREATING A NEW ENTITY THAT CAN HAVE A FEW PROGRAMS YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT POLICY CHANGES ACROSS THE. THE ENTIRE SYSTEM THAT WOULD IMPROVE IT BUT AGAIN IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOUR GOAL IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT. BIG FOCUS ON THIS IS KIND OF FUN TO DO MANY THINGS THAT WERE NOT ALWAYS YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON THE WAY WE TALK ABOUT THE SOMETIMES IT'S WIDEN ASPECT OF MORE PUTTING THEM UP IN THE OTHER. YEAH HIT THE WAY I'M LOOKING AT THIS WE ARE TO HAVE THE WILL. I WAS THE THE HUB. AND I I SEE THEM CREATING A NEW WHEEL AND A NEW HUB. THAT'S WHY I'M STRUGGLING WITH THIS AND I I BELIEVE THEY HAVE A COMPOSITION NOW TO DO THIS. IT PROBABLY AN EVEN MUCH MORE TIMELY MANNER AND WE'RE CREATING A NEW BUREAUCRACY A NEW ADMINISTRATION. WHEN YOU HAVE TO PLAY OVER HERE WHAT COULD YOU WHO JUST HAVE ONE PLACE YOU COULD APPLY QUITE FRANKLY ONE PLACE YOU APPLY FOR ALL COMMITTEE COLLEGES IN THE STATE. AND THEN YOU COULD ACCESS ALL THOSE CLASSES ON THE WHEEL AS OPPOSED TO AGAIN REINVENTING. THE WHOLE NEW. APPROACH AND THEN THEY'D BE STILL BE SEPARATE. WE'RE LOOKING AT REALLY IS INTEGRATING. NOT. A GOOD ANYONE COMMENT DID YOU KNOW I WOULD JUST SAY I I THINK WE. WE COULD HAVE THE WHEEL I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE WHEEL TODAY SO I THINK THE ARGUMENT THAT. MANY MAKE IS THAT YOU COULD BUILD OUT THESE TYPES OF COURSES AT SKILLED THE EXISTING COLLEGES. I THINK WE THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF OF ALL OF THE ABOVE THAT. ON THE EXISTING COURSES IN WHAT WE CALL THE. A WE AYE OUR ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE. I THINK WE YOU KNOW WE AGREE THAT THERE'S MORE WORK TO DO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CALLS OUT THERE'S MORE WORK TO DO TO BUILD THOSE INTO ASSOCIATE DEGREE PATHWAYS. AND SO WE WILL BE DOING THAT WORK SIMULTANEOUSLY I THINK THERE'S THIS GAP OF WHERE ARE THE COMPETENCY BASED PROGRAMS THAT MEET THE NEEDS ARE FOR WORKING LEARNERS. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE THINK THE ONLINE. NOT BE ONLINE COLLEGE WILL HELP TO ADDRESS BUT I THINK WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT AND AND PART OF WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ALSO OF A YOU KNOW. SUGGESTS IS THAT HOW DOES THIS NEW ONLINE COLLEGE FEED INTO A PATHWAY IN OUR EXISTING COLLEGES SO I THINK ALL OF THE STRATEGIES ARE THINGS THAT. WE AGREEMENT SENSE WE THINK ESTABLISHING A NEW ONLINE COLLEGES AND IT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF KIND OF THAT OVERALL STRATEGY AROUND ONLINE EDUCATION. AROUND EDUCATION FOR WORKING LEARNERS AROUND WHAT ARE COLLEGES DO GENERALLY. YEAH I I DON'T THINK YOU'RE WRONG I JUST ANOTHER YOU'RE RIGHT. MY HEAD. OF ME. I AGAIN I JUST HOPE THE COMMITTEE WILL CONSIDER. THE CHAIR YOU TO AYE AND AND WHAT THEY TOLD ME LOOKS LIKE BECAUSE AGAIN IF WE HAVE CAPACITY AROUND THE STATE. AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WIRE WE THEN GOING TO REINVENT IT PUT IN JUST ONE PLACE. SO IF THERE IS THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT. AFTER A FEW MORE QUESTIONS OUT ICE WANNA FOCUS. TYPICALLY ON THE FACULTY AND THE STUDENTS THAT'S. PART OF WHAT HIGHER EDUCATION IS ALL ABOUT. SO FIRST. FIRST WITH THE STUDENTS SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT. THE NEED FOR MORE EDUCATION HIGHER EDUCATION BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL INKED CREDIT YOU KNOW. JOB FORCE THAT TODAY AND TOMORROW AND YOU KNOW WE WE LAID OUT AND YOU'VE LAID OUT A LOT OF RESEARCH IS TALKING ABOUT STRANDED WORKERS AND WHERE THEY ARE. AND. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW RESEARCH SHOWS THAT. THAT THE TYPE OF STUDENTS THAT ARE SO CALLED MISTREATED WORKER. BOX TRADITIONALLY DON'T DO WELL. IN ONLINE EDUCATION ONLINE ARE TO CASES USING THE ONES WITH MORE EDUCATION WITH EITHER AT. SOME COLLEGE R. RD A DEGREE GETTING AT ANOTHER DEGREE TO SUCCEED AND A LOT OF THAT IS THE IS THE SUPPORT SERVICES AND. NOW THAT'S A BIG PART OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHY SOME PEOPLE DON'T SUCCEED BECAUSE. THEIR EDUCATION. HOW BASIC AM? YOU KNOW BACKGROUNDS AND WHEREWITHAL TO MANEUVER THE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM IS THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK. AND SO. HOW IS THIS GOING TO ADDRESS STUDENTS IN SUPPORT SERVICES AND OTHER WORDS IT? YOU KNOW. IF YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE THE CLASS THERE'D SCOUTS LAYING IN STATE STAFF HOURS AND ALL THAT AT A CUBICLES CAMPUS AND SO HOW HAVE YOU ADDRESSED. IT'S THE STUDENT NEEDS IN THIS PROPOSAL NUMBER ONE. SURE I THINK IT START. ANSWERING A QUESTION. SO A COUPLE OF AREAS AND AS A STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES OUT WILL BE KEY IN THIS PROPOSAL AND AS OUTLINED AS PART OF THAT AT LEGISLATION. THERE'S A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT UNIT THAT WOULD BE A CORE COMPONENTS OF THE ONLINE COLLEGE THAT WILL FOCUS ON. ADDRESS SEEN ANY GAPS AND NEEDS AND. PROVIDING THE APPROPRIATE SUPPORT SERVICES UP FOR THEIR STUDENTS OUT ONE OF THE AREAS THAT THE. I TRAILER BILL OUTLINES IT'S AT TWENTY FOUR HOUR AND SUPPORT SERVICE AND AT COUNSELING AND TUTORING BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF STUDENTS WHO ARE OLDER WHO ARE TAKING ONLINE COURSES. WHEN THEY NEED THE HELP IT'S TEN PM ON A SUNDAY NIGHT SO DEVELOPING A SUPPORT STRUCTURE A UP WITH AYE COUNSELING AYE TUTORING AYE. AT HOURS WHERE IT MEETS US STUDENTS AT NEEDS AS ONE COMPONENT THAT'S OUTLINED WHAT HAPPENS IF THIS DIDN'T ONCE SAID TO TALK TO SOMEBODY IN PERSON STEPS PEOPLE ALWAYS LIKE TO CALL THAT. APPLE TECH LINE WHEN IT SOMETIMES GET A LIVE PERSON OR MAYBE GO TO THE APPLE STORE AND TALK TO SOMEBODY THAT'S MAYBE NOT RIGHT EXAMPLE BUT. YOU KNOW STUDENTS ARE THE SAME WAY SO. IT IS THERE A HYBRID MODEL WHERE STUDENTS COULD GO IN AND IT EVEN IF IT'S NOT TEN O'CLOCK MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR DURING THE WEEK AND. TALK TO A REAL LIFE PERSON BECAUSE. THAT'S WHAT BRING STUDENTS TO SUCCESS IN AND. THE THROUGHOUT TIME THROUGHOUT OUR EXPERIENCE GOING BACK. YOU KNOW DECADES. I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW I'VE I THINK WERE WE'RE PROBABLY RIGHT I REIMAGINE AND AS PART OF OUR DESIGN PROCESS WE RECOGNIZE THAT IN PERSON. CONNECTIONS MATTER THAT A LOT OF YOU KNOW WE HELD THE DESIGN SESSION. YOU KNOW A FEW MONTHS AGO AND ONE OF THE BIG THINGS WE LEARNED FROM OTHER FOLKS WHO DO WORK IN THE SPACE IS THAT YOU NEED TO KIND OF COACHING AND MENTORING IS A BIG PART OF THIS WORK IN THAT YOU NEED. BOTH KIND OF WELL SO COACHING AND MENTORING IS IMPORTANT AND SO CAN IF HAVING A ROLE THERE THAT. MAYBE IS FACE TO FACE BUT I THINK IN MANY CASES THE HOUSE HOW WILL THAT COACHING AND MENTORING WORK. IN PERSON OR YOU TAXING SOMEBODY ON YOUR ANDROID. PHONE AT THREE IN THE MORNING WHO'S MAYBE LIVES IN FLORIDA I THINK THERE'S A SO NOT IN FLORIDA I THINK WE'VE MADE A COMMITMENT THAT. IT OUT THAT THESE THAT THE STAFF IS BASED IN CALIFORNIA. BUT I DO THINK THAT PART OF. YOU KNOW WE HAVE EXAMPLES OF WHERE THAT COACHING MENTORING WORKS WELL ONLINE AND WE THINK IN MANY CASES IT WORKS BETTER ONLINE YEAH. BUT IT DOES SPACE DON'T SEE STARTED RISK RESPECTFULLY NOT ANSWER EITHER OF YOU ARE WELL WILL BE. A PHYSICAL IN PERSON PLACE WHERE STUDENTS CAN ENGAGE IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO I THINK IN GENERAL WE IMAGINE THAT THERE ARE IN PERSON AND. OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTERACTION WE DON'T YET KNOW WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE I THINK MUCH OF THIS DESIGN. YOU KNOW WE'VE. WE'RE TRYING TO DESIGN AT THE SAME TIME IS TRYING TO KIND OF RESPOND TO KIND OF FEEDBACK WE'VE HEARD BUT I THINK YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD LOTS OF FEEDBACK ABOUT NEEDING SOME TYPE OF IN PERSON INTERACTION. I THINK WE'VE MADE A COMMITMENT TO TO HAVING THAT IMPRESSIVE INTERACTION LOW THAT LOOK LIKE IS AN ONLINE. UNIVERSITY FOR CALIFORNIA OF SOMEBODY IN COACHELLA. IN CHICO. SACRAMENTO SAN JOSE. AND BAKERSFIELD SO HOW HOW WILL THAT PERSON IF THEY COLLEGES HERE. YET DOWN AND YOU KNOW RED CIRCLE OVER WHAT HAVE YOU EVER THE LOS RIOS HAS A SITE THEY WANT TO HAVE THIS. HOW WOULD THAT HOW WOULD THAT WORK AND I PROBABLY DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC ANSWER IF YOU WANT ON THE KIND OF EXACTLY HOW IT WORKS AYE MATCH YOU KNOW I THINK THAT IS WHY YOU HAVE IMPORTANT INFORMATION TO KNOW? WHAT THINK IT YOU KNOW PART OF THIS WE HAVE MADE THE CASE THAT AN IMPORTANT PART OF DOING THIS WORK AND SCALE IS BEING ABLE TO DO IT ONLINE SO I DON'T WANNA NAM? CAN I WOULDN'T CONCEDE THE FACT THAT WE CAN'T OFFER A VARIETY OF SERVICES THAT FOLKS TRADITIONALLY IMAGINE NEED IN PERSON INTERACTION THAT WE COULDN'T DO THAT ONLINE AND WE'VE SEEN EXAMPLES IN OTHER CONTEXTS. OF WAYS IN WHICH FOLKS DO THAT ONLINE I THINK THE. A PLACE WHERE A LOT OF UP IN OUR DESIGN PROCESS A LOT OF THE IN PERSON INTERACTION. IS NOT NECESSARILY BETWEEN TENTATIVE THE NEED OF OF THE STAFF PERSON AT THE COLLEGE IN THE STUDENT BUT THAT YOU OFTEN WANT KIND OF COHORTS OF STUDENTS WHO ARE GOING THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE TOGETHER. TO HAVE A SUPPORT NETWORK TO. TO MAKE THIS FEASIBLE AND SO WE'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT HOW DO YOU IMAGINE KIND OF INTERMEDIARY ORGANIZATIONS ARE HOW DO YOU BUILD A SENSE OF COMMUNITY. A LOT OF WHAT WE'VE. DON IS KIND OF I THINK CRITICAL TO THIS. PROPOSAL IS THE PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE'VE HAD WITH EMPLOYERS AND WITH TOM LABOR ORGANIZATIONS UNIONS OUT TO FIND EMPLOYEES AT THEIR WORK SPACES. DESIGNED INSTRUCTION THAT IS RELEVANT TO THEM IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE. BOTH KIND OF. EMPLOYMENT AND ACHIEVE EARNINGS GAINS IN THAT. AND THAT WORK ENVIRONMENT SO I THINK. THAT THE STRUCTURE THAT WE'VE DESIGNED FOR A PER FIRST PATHWAYS IS CAN WE DESIGN PATHWAYS WHERE WE HAVE A SET OF EMPLOYEES WHO WITH ADDITIONAL SKILLS. COULD ACHIEVE SOME TYPE OF A LABOR MARKET OUTCOME THAT WE THINK IS IMPORTANT. OKAY I'M NOT. QUITE CERTAIN THAT THAT ADDRESSES THAT THAT THAT ISSUE BUT BUT I'LL MOVE ON. AS FAR AS THE THAT THE BARGAINING ISSUE FOR IT FOR THE FACULTY. HOW WILL THAT WORK IS APPARENTLY? THAT YOU'D HAVE TO ABBOTT DISTRICTS DO THE BARGAINING FOR THE NEW CAMPUS WHICH IS RUN BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS YEAH THAT HOW THAT ALL THE CIVIC ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAD HEARD ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S AYE JANUARY PROPOSAL WAS AMBIGUITY AROUND. COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IN THE INTERIM SO I THINK WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES. HIS PROVIDE SOME CERTAINTY THAT ONE THIS COLLEGES ESTABLISHED THERE'S A PROCESS FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNDER EXISTING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING LAWS. AND SO THE OUR ONLINE COLLEGE WE CONTRACT WITH THE DISTRICT THE DISTRICT WOULD SERVICE THE PARTY IN TERMS OF. THE EXISTING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING LAWS AND THE ONLINE COLLEGE WOULD APPEAR TO BE OF THE TERMS OF THAT AGREEMENT. AND WERE THESE BE. PART TIME FACULTY POSITIONS. THEIR FULL TIME FACULTY I THINK WE HAVE MADE A CLEAR COMMITMENT THAT WE WILL HAVE FULL TIME FACULTY OF THE COLLEGE. ALL OF THEM. I NOT ALL OF THEM IN THE THE GOVERNOR'S TRAILER BILL SUGGESTS THAT THERE WOULD BE A COMBINATION OF FULL TIME AND PART TIME BUT WE HAD EXPECTED HER TO THE SOFA. TO THE RIGHT ARE THE EXPECTATIONS OF LAWLER AROUND HOW WE. HOW WE ADMINISTER? A FACULTY SYSTEM THAT HAS BOTH PART TIME FULL TIME. AND THEN YOU MENTIONED AND THIS THE CONCERN EARLIER. I THINK MISTER DON ABOUT A COUPLE MONTHS AGO. AS FAR AS WHERE THE FACULTY MEMBERS WHO WOULD BE. SEVEN IT THEY WOULDN'T THEY COULDN'T BE AN ITEM OR FLORIDA OR SOMEWHERE THAT THEY HAVE TO BE CALIFORNIA. RESIDENTS AND HOW DO YOU ENFORCE THAT. I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO WORK OUT BE THINK OF THE GOVERNOR'S TRAILER BILL AND AND FINANCE SINCE RICHARD PROBABLY BETTER THAN I CAN BUT THE GOVERNOR'S TRAILER BILL MAKES A CLEAR EXPECTATION THAT WE ARE RECRUITING IN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE COMMITTED TO HAVING CALIFORNIA FACULTY CALIFORNIA BATES FACULTY. AND YOU SAID THAT YOU YOU THINK YOU NOW HAVE. BUY IN FROM FROM FACULTY AND WE HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT LATER BUT YOU MEANT I HELPED WRITE AND SAY THAT WE HAVE BY AND FROM FACULTY AYE I THINK WE RESPONDED TO MUCH OF THE CONCERNS I WILL LET THEM SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES BUT. BUT BUT IF I IF IT SOUNDED LIKE A SUBURB PATIENT PUBLIC WHO WANTS TO EXPAND. EXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS ON THIS BUT BUT WE DO THINK THAT WE RESPONDED TO MUCH OF THE FEEDBACK THAT WE HEARD. AND THEN AGAIN JUST GOING BACK TO WHAT WAS ASKED EARLIER SO SO YOU'RE YOU'RE ALL CONVINCED THAT. YOU COULDN'T DO THIS THROUGH AN EXISTING. COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND AND I THINK OTHER WORDS I THINK SAN DIEGO. PROPOSE THIS LAST LAST FALL BUT THEY COULD BE THE CALIFORNIA HAVE. OF THIS WORKING WITH OTHER COLLEGES COMMITTEE COLLEGES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND AND YOU'RE CONVINCED THAT THAT. WOULDN'T. BE. THAT WOULDN'T BE AT THAT A GOOD OPTION TO TO REACH TO STRANDED WORKERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA I THINK GIVEN THE RESOURCES WE HAVE IN THE. AND. THE CRITERIA WE'VE APPLIED THAT WE WANT TO DO THIS THAT SCALE WE WANT TO DO THE SENATE COMPETENCY BASED WAY WE WANT TO. TARGET THIS POPULATION OF STUDENTS AND DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY AROUND THIS POPULATION OF STUDENTS. I THINK GIVEN THOSE PRIORITIES AND THE. AND THE PARAMETERS IN THE BUDGET WE THINK THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE THAT OUTCOME. OKAY. THANK YOU. SO THAT MR MEDINA. ON LITTLE CONFUSED ON THE STRUCTURE. STILL ON ON GOVERNANCE AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. SO WE HAVE YOU WOULD HAVE A. THE GROUP THE. TRUSTEES. THE. BOARD OF GOVERNORS. RIGHT BOARD OF GOVERNORS WHO WOULD ACT. AS. TRUSTEES FOR THIS NEW COLLEGE CORRECT. AT CREDIT RIGHT. THEY WOULD HIRE PRESIDENT. CORRECT. AND THAT PRESIDENT WOULD BE ON A DIFFERENT COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUS. I KNOW OR HE WOULD BE WHERE. THAT I. THAT PRESIDENT WOULD BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE ONLINE COLLEGE AND WHERE WOULD HE BE PHYSICALLY. I DON'T THINK THAT CAN DETERMINE THE UP. LET'S YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THE THE THE HEADQUARTERS OF THIS OPERATION WOULD BE LOCATED. BUT THIS THE FACULTY WOULD BARGAIN WITH SOMEONE ELSE. A PARTNER DISTRICT THE COLLEGE BUT CONTRACT WAITED A PARTNER AYE IN EXISTING PARTNER DISTRICT TO ESTABLISH A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT FOR THE FACULTY OF THE COLLEGE WITH ANOTHER DISTRICT. AT CORRECT THE OTHER DISTRICT IN EXISTING TO AN EXISTING DISTRICT SO FAR UNSPECIFIED. CORRECT DO YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT. OF IT OF THE. DISTRICT. FOR COLLEGE WHO REALLY DOESN'T BARGAIN WITH HIS OWN FACULTY. ARE NOT DIRECTLY UNDER THE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE LAW. SO SO THE BARGAINING MEMBERS OF THE ACT COLLEGE THIS ONLINE COLLEGE WOULD ACTUALLY BE. OF FACULTY OF A DIFFERENT COLLEGE. I THINK THAT WOULD BE DETERMINED THAT'S PART OF THE AGREEMENT BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BARGAIN WITH WITH WITH WITH THEIR NOT INVITING WITH THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES ARE NOT GOING TO BARGAIN WITH THE. RIGHT RIGHT FOR THE PURPOSES OF WHAT WE TRADITIONALLY THINK OF AS KIND OF THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP OF WHO DIRECTS THE WORK WHO MANAGES THE EMPLOYEES THEY WOULD BE EMPLOYEES OF THE ONLINE COLLEGE. I THINK FOR PURPOSES OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. WE HEARD A LOT OF FEEDBACK THAT WE HAD BEEN. THAT IT WAS UNCLEAR HOW COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WOULD WORK PARTICULARLY IS THIS COLLEGES SET UP AND SO WE THINK IT'S ARM A WORKABLE. STRUCTURE THAT MAKES SENSE TO. TO MAKE CLEAR THAT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING APPLIES IMMEDIATELY AND THIS IS HOW WE WOULD MAKE IT AFFECT HOW EFFECTUALLY BUT I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT AT A MINIMUM IT CERTAINLY. CUMBERSOME. THIS NEW. STRUCTURE. AND WHO THE FACULTY REPORTS TO. AND. WHO THEY BARGAIN WITH? UNDERSTOOD THE ONE PIECE THAT I WOULD ADD TO THAT IS THAT IT WOULD BE A SEPARATE BARGAINING UNIT AT THAT COLLEGE SO IT WOULDN'T BE WITHIN. THE EXISTING AGREEMENT OF THAT THE PARTNER DISTRICT. OKAY. THANK YOU SO MEMBER LIMON. THANK YOU. AT A THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATION AND DIALOGUE ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL AND NOT JUST LIMITED TO THIS BUILDING. BUT REALLY I THINK AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL I KNOW THAT. I FOR ONE HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT. IN THE DISTRICT A WITH MULTIPLE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND I GO BACK TO SOME OF MY EARLIER REMARKS ON IN THIS PARTICULAR AT COMMITTEE. ABOUT SOME OF THE ELEMENTS THAT. CONTINUE TO BE. CONVERSATIONS OR. OF INTEREST IN IN IN MOVING FORWARD ON I A THINK YOU'VE HEARD FROM MULTIPLE COLLEAGUES AT THE PIECE ABOUT LAYING AT IN TERMS OF LANGUAGE AND CLARITY ABOUT. WHO THE FACULTY WERE GONNA BE ARE THEY GONNA HAVE? BARGAINING UNITS WHO WOULD BE NEGOTIATING I THINK IS IMPORTANT IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS. IN INTEREST IN KNOWING WHAT THAT IS. AND SECONDLY ARE YOU KNOW A COUPLE MONTHS AGO I MENTIONED. THE QUESTION WHY NOT THIS BE A PILOT WHY NOT UNDERSTAND WHETHER OR NOT ON THIS IS GOING TO BE GOOD FOR THE LONG TERM. YEAH THIRDLY ON IF IT'S A IF IT'S CONSIDERED A PILOT PROGRAM. ON THE IDEA OF CREATING. BOARD OF TRUSTEES SEEMS A LITTLE PREMATURE. IN UNTIL WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ROLE IS AND. FOURTH AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT REALLY LIMITING THE COURSES TEND NOT TO. BEING THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY OFFERED BY EXISTING COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND SO I WANTED TO SHARE SOME OF THOSE PIECES JUST BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE THOSE ARE PIECES. THAT ARE STILL OUT THERE. EIGHT SEEMS AT THE REPEATEDLY GET BROUGHT OUT BUT I ALSO THINK THAT IN SOME WAYS AND CONSIDERATION OF SOME OF THESE PIECES WOULD ALLOW FOR. PERHAPS. EXIT YOU KNOW AT A TIPPING TAD BIT MORE COMFORT AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT THIS COULD LOOK LIKE BOTH IN THE SHORT TERM AND THE LONG TERM. I'M SO I WANTED TO SHARE THAT AND KNOW THAT THIS IS. PART OF IT. HAS IT IN REACHED UP THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT. WHAT WE THINK OF ONLINE ON IT LEARNING I'M ALTOGETHER AYE AND I APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION BUT I DO HOPE THAT? IN EFFORT TO. BUT TO BRING MORE STAKEHOLDERS I'M ALL INTO SOMETHING I THINK THAT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET MORE FOLKS ON BOARD BECAUSE IF WE DON'T THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE WE CAN'T. IT'S IT'S A RICH A REALLY HARD THING TO MAKE SOMETHING SUCCESSFUL WHEN THE STAKEHOLDERS I DON'T HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF BY AN INVESTMENT WHERE THEY HAVE CONCERNS FROM THE. BEGINNING ON ANYTHING IF THERE IS A COMMITMENT FOR THIS TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND NOT JUST TO BE SOMETHING THAT. YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY HAPPENS A YEAR TO AND THEN. WITH THAT NEW GOVERNOR ANY LEGISLATURE GOES A DIFFERENT DIRECTION THAN I THINK THAT THE EFFORTS UP FRONT TO TRY TO MAKE THIS. A DIFFERENT A DIFFERENT TYPE OF A PROGRAM COULD BE ON MORE HELPFUL. THANK YOU I THINK THAT CELL THAT THAT'S ALL FOR NOW. WE'LL COME BACK TO THIS ITEM. AT A LATER DATE. ISSUE NUMBER TO THE GOVERNOR'S. FUNDING FORMULA PROPOSAL AND THERE REVISIONS. FROM THE LAKE LATEST MAY REVISED POST. I'VE MORE IT'S IT WOULD KEY SO WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AYE SINCE THE RELEASE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE HAS ENGAGED COLLEGE LEADERS AND STAKEHOLDERS ON THE PROPOSED AT FUNDING AT STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA. THE MAYOR VISION INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS AND RESPONDS OUGHT TO FEEDBACK AND RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AS ALL HIGHLIGHTS AT THOSE CHANGES. OF FIRST THE ME REVISION INCLUDES ADJUSTMENTS TO THE OVERALL FRAMEWORK OF THE FORMULA THEY WERE VICE FORMULA REFLECTS A AT REVISED OVERALL DISTRIBUTION OF SIXTY PERCENT OF THE BASE ALLOCATION. TWENTY PERCENT OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL ALLOCATION AND TWENTY PERCENT AS A STUDENT SUCCESS INCENTIVE ALLOCATION ND AGAIN THE BASE ALLOCATION REFLECTS AN ALLOCATION BASED ON A ROMANCE. BE AYE SUPPLEMENTAL ALLOCATION REPRESENTS AB IN ALLOCATION BASED ON HIGH NEED AT STUDENTS ENROLLMENT OF HIGH NEED STUDENTS. AND THE STUDENT SUCCESS INCENTIVE ALLOCATION IT'S BASED ON AT SPECIFIC SUCCESS METRICS. ADVOCATES REVISED AT DISTRIBUTION WHEN WE BELIEVE AT SOME ADDITIONAL STABILITY TO. COLLEGES HAS EIGHT I WOULD TRANSITION TO A NEW FORMULA. I I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT ONTHE BASE AT ALLOCATION OUTSIDE THE MARRIAGE AND PROPOSES USING A THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE TO CALCULATE ENROLLMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE BASS GRANT TO BETTER PROTECT. I'D DISTRICTS UP FROM A ROMAN SWINGS AND IN RESPONSE TO THE IMPACT OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSED OF FUNDING FORMULA NONCREDIT INSTRUCTION. THE MAYOR VISION PROPOSES TO CONTINUE TO FIND NONCREDIT INSTRUCTION AT AT THE EXISTING RATES SO OUTSIDE OF THAT AT PROPOSED FUNDING FORMULA. THE MAYOR VISION ALSO REVISES A SUPPLEMENTAL ALLOCATION TO INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS OVER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE RECEIVING A COLLEGE PROMISE CRAP FEE WAIVER. AB FIVE FORTY STUDENTS AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF STUDENTS RECEIVING A PELL GRANT. THE MAYOR VISION ALSO REVISES THE STUDENT SUCCESS ALLOCATION METRICS TO BETTER REFLEXIVE PROGRESS METRICS AND ALIGNED WITH THE GOALS OF THE VISION FIRST EXCESS. THE REVISED METRICS INCLUDE COMPLETION OF ASSOCIATE DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES OVER EIGHTEEN UNITS ADAM ASSOCIATES DEGREES FOR TRANSFERS. SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER TO FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS COMPLETION OF TRANSFER LEVEL MATH AND ENGLISH IN THE FIRST YEAR. OBTAINING ORIGINAL LIVING WAGE WITHIN A YEAR OF COMPLETING A DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE PROGRAM AND SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING NINE UNITS OF CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION COURSES. IN RESPONSE IF YOU BACK ABOUT THE TRANSITION TO THE NEW FOR FUNDING FORMULA AND AND THE HOLD HARMLESS THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES A TWO YEAR ABSOLUTE HOLD HARMLESS RATHER THAN ONE YEAR. THIS WOULD ENSURE THAT NO DISTRICT WILL RECEIVE LESS AND BOTH EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND NINETEEN TWENTY AND RECEIVED AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. ADDITIONALLY THE MARAVICH ARE PROPOSES A HUNDRED AND FOUR MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO PROVIDE ONE TIME I'D DISCRETIONARY RESOURCES TO DISTRICTS TO ENSURE THAT EVERY DISTRICT. OUT HAS A YEAR OVER YEAR A FUNDING INCREASE FROM SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TO EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THAT REFLECTS A GROWTH OF AT LEAST TWO POINT SEVEN ONE PERCENT. IN REGARD TO. TOO CATEGORICAL CONSOLIDATION AND ADD THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DIRECTOR THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO DEVELOP A PROPOSAL FOR THE MAY REVISION. THAT WOULD CONSOLIDATE CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS BASED ON THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE RECOMMENDATIONS THE MAYOR OF ASIA PROPOSES TO INTEGRATE THE STUDENT SUCCESS THAT'S APART PROGRAM THE STUDENT EQUITY PROGRAM AND THE STUDENT SUCCESS. OF FOR BASIC SKILLS PROGRAM THESE PROGRAMS ALL SEEK TO SERVE AT THE SAME STUDENT POPULATIONS AND CONSOLIDATING THEM WOULD GIVE DISTRICTS AND HANDS FLEXIBILITY AND FOR THEIR BELTS ON AT THE GUY PATHWAYS FRAMEWORK. OUT WE WOULD NOT THAT IT'S PROPOSAL DOES NOT IMPACT ETHIOPIA'S AT FUNDING FOR VETERANS RESOURCE CENTERS OUT FOSTER IN THE FOSTER YOUTH PROGRAM OR THE DISABLED A STUDENT AT PROGRAM SO THOSE REMAIN. A SEPARATE CATEGORY WAS AND THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. OKAY. THANK YOU HELLO. A GROUP CALLED THE LEAD SAID ABOUT WITH A FIFTH. WE ARE GENERALLY ARMS YOU KNOW WE WERE GENTLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE FUNDING FORMULA I'M AT THE RIDLEY PROPOSE THAT WE DO THINK OVERALL. THIS THIS PROPOSAL IS IS THAT BETTER PROPOSAL THAN WHAT WAS IN JANUARY AND THEN ADDRESS THE SEVERAL OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAD. OMINOUSLY FARM MOST RE THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE IS THAT THE. HAVE THE MORE PER PERFORMANCE BASED FUNDING THAT SPECIFICALLY TIED TO THE OUTCOMES OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS. ARE AND AND WE THINK THAT IS AN IMPORTANT I'M A ISSUE THAT WASN'T THERE IN JANUARY THAT WE THINK HELPS ENSURE THAT THERE'S MORE. INCENTIVE FOR COLLEGES TO REALLY FOCUS ON IMPROVING OTHER SUPPORT IMPROVING THE OUTCOMES OF OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS. I'M NOT ALTHOUGH WE WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE THINK THE UP ABOUT A PROPOSAL THAT IN JANUARY WE DID HAD RECOMMENDED ADOPTING I THINK WE RECOGNIZE THOUGH THAT. THE LAB WE VERY FAST AND AND ARE YOU DO NOT HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO REALLY BUT THOROUGHLY BACK AND REVIEW BALANCE OF OF THE PROPOSED ON THIS IS A MORE COMPLEX PROPOSAL THEM. BENT DOWN WE HAD IN JANUARY THERE THERE ARE A LOT THE OUTCOMES BASED PORTION IN PARTICULAR IS THAT IT IS MUCH MORE COMPLEX SO WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT YOU ADOPT THE FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROPOSAL. BUT NOT AND NOT TO BE IMPLEMENTED UNTIL NINETEEN TWENTY I'M AND THEN THERE IN THE SUMMER THROUGH LEGISLATION I'M YOU CAN BET THE SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF THAT OF THE PERFORMANCE BASED. AND THE FUNDAMENTAL GRANT FUNDING TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT THOSE PUT THOSE METRICS ARE THAT WOULD GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO. TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH BOTH METRICS WHAT THE THING TIME I'M BEGINNING SORT OF THAT SENDING THE SIGNAL TO COLLEGE OF THE WOULD BE MOVING THEM IN THAT DIRECTION. I'M IF YOU DID DO THAT THEN. THERE IS ABOUT BY TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE MILLION THAT MAY REVISION A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AND THEN THERE'S A HUNDRED AND FOUR MILLION THAT WAS ADDED IN THE IN THE MIRROR VISION THAT ARE ALL ASSOCIATED WITH SORT OF HOLDING. IT'S HARMLESS FOR THE TRANSITION THAT FUNDING WOULD BE FREED UP FOR ONE TYPES. I'M WITH REGARDS TO THE BLOCK GRANT I THINK YOU KNOW IT SUPPORTIVE OF MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF CONSOLIDATING CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND. WE CAN ADMINISTRATION PROPOSALS AT GOOD START WE WOULD ACTUALLY RECOMMEND. CONSIDERING ADDING ADDITIONAL OF SUPPORT PROGRAMS INTO BLOCK GRANT TO PROVIDE GREATER FLEXIBILITY FOR DISTRICTS. I'M WE WOULD ALSO OF. RECOMMENDED YOU CONSIDER OUT OF BED. THINKING ABOUT THAT A NEW FORMULA FOR THIS BLOCK GRANT RIGHT NOW THE PROPOSAL IS THAT YEAH DISTRICT WHO JUST RECEIVE WHATEVER THEY HAD GOTTEN IN THE PAST. BOTTOM THINK THAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND. DEVELOPING IN THE FARM THAT'S THAT THIS IS UPDATED IN THE FUTURE AND A THIRD OF JUST BECOME STALE AND SORT OF NOT REFLECTIVE OF. OF DISTRICTS NEED MOVING FORWARD. I'M HOW YOU ACTUALLY. KIND REDISTRIBUTIVE FOR MILLER CHANGED THE FORMULA REALLY DEPEND ON WHAT YOU WHAT YOU DECIDE ON THE APPORTIONMENT FACTOR FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU DECIDED NOT TO DO. A NEW FUNDING FORMULA YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER MAKING THIS A BLOCK GRANT A LITTLE BIT MORE TIED TO. INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS TO DISTRICTS SO THAT YOU ARE PROVIDING A LITTLE BIT MORE FUNDING SO THAT THOSE DIDN'T GET GREATER SUPPORT. I'M IF YOU DID ADOPTED THE FUNDING FORMULA THAT HAD SOME COMPONENT THE PROVIDED MORE THAN FUNDING MAYBE WOULD NEED THAT BUT WE DO THINK REVISITING THE FORMULA NOT JUST LOCKING IT IN PLACE OF THAT WASN'T SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. HELPS INSURE THEM MOVING FORWARD WERE ALIGNING OUR FUNDING WITH WITH THE NEEDS OF DISTRICTS. THANK YOU COMMITTEE CALL JUST RESPONSE WHEN YOU WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. TO BEGIN WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. I JUST WANT TO EXPLAIN THAT TO THE DOCUMENTS THAT WE DISTRIBUTED OF THE FIRST IS OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE FUNDING FORMULA. SO THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. YOU KNOW AFTER THE JANUARY BUDGET OUR OFFICE AND MANY IN THE SYSTEM DID. EXTENSIVE WORK TO EVALUATE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THE FORMULA THIS DOCUMENT IS THE A. IS THE CULMINATION THE PRODUCT OF THAT WORK AND SO. IT OUT HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WE APPRECIATE THAT MOST OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SO THE SECOND PACKET OF INFORMATION. SHOWS OUR RECOMMENDATIONS COMPARED TO THEM A REVISION PROPOSAL. WE ADDRESSED BOTH THE FUNDING FORMULA AND CATEGORICAL CONSOLIDATION. AND WE ARE. PLEASED TO SEE I GOT MOST OF THEM IN THE MIRROR VISION I WOULD JUST SAY ANYTHING FOR. A FEW REASONS. YOU KNOW WE THINK THIS IS THE TIME TO TAKE ACTION ON THE FUNDING FORMULA. ONE WE THINK. YOU KNOW THERE'S AN URGENCY AROUND THE VISION FOR SUCCESS THAT WE'VE TALKED MANY TIMES THIS YEAR ABOUT OTHER GOALS THAT WE'VE INCLUDED IN THE AUDITION FOR SUCCESS. WE THINK THE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL REFLECTS THOSE VALUES REFLECTS THE MEASURES THAT WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT OFFER COLLEGES TO MAKE PROGRESS TOWARD. SECOND WE THINK THAT. NOW IS AN IMPORTANT TIME GIVEN THE RESOURCES IN THE STATE BUDGET FOR US TO BEGIN TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES ACCORDING TO OUR PRIORITIES TO DIRECT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO LOW INCOME STUDENTS INTO. DEBIAN TO REFLECT THE A THE FOCUS ON OUTCOMES THAT WE THINK ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT. HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS THANK YOU ARE ALL START THE QUESTIONING HERE AT FIRST OF ALL I I DON'T THINK THIS IS A BAD IDEA. AS FAR AS A NEW FUNDING FORMULA RECOGNIZING. DIFFERENT STUDENT POPULATIONS I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS ALL COOKED READY TO GO AS THE LA ALLUDED TO. AT LAST YEAR'S SUMMIT REALLY MONNING I INTRODUCED LEGISLATION LOOKING AT THIS CONCEPT AND WE ASK THE ELLIOT HELPLESS. I FIGURED OUT ON AN OVER ARCHING. KINDA CONCERN I HAVE FOR THIS IS. IF IF YOU TRY TO COMPARE THIS TO EXAMPLE LCF PFAFF WAS WE WENT THROUGH A COUPLE YEARS AGO. AT THE END OF THE DAY AFTER A YEAR AND A HALF PROCESS WE HAD CONSENSUS WITH. THE AT THE END COALITION COMMUNITY WITH THAT ACCESS AND SCHOOL BOARDS AND. TEACHERS UNIONS AND SO FORTH AND SO. THAT IS IS VIC IS REALLY LACKING HERE TODAY AND I THINK THAT MAKES I MEAN I THINK THE COMMITTEE. UNEASY ABOUT DOING SUCH A A MAJOR CHANGE WHEN THERE IS LOT OF CONSTERNATION AND UNCERTAINTY. AND PERCEIVE MAJOR WINNERS AND LOSERS AND WE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR FROM SOME OF THE. DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE EARLIER HEARING AND AND THE NEW. RUNS THAT YOU CREATE THAT YOU KNOW I THINK BRING A LITTLE MORE CLARITY BUT THERE ARE STILL SON. WHO HAD DIED A LOT OF CONCERNS AND THE HOLD HARMLESS SO I GUESS IT'S ANOTHER YEAR OF HOLD HARMLESS BUT AFTER THE THIRD YEAR? IT'S KIND OF A CLIFF. AND AND SOME OF THE DISTRICTS THEY WOULD SENSI. BUT THERE ALLOCATION WOULD BE LESS THAN THEY WOULD GET. UNDER JUST A BASIC COLA SO. I'M. NOT CERTAIN IF FOR ALL THEIR GUIDES JUST YET DOWN PLUS THE. THAT THE METRICS THAT WOULD THAT WE PUT IN HERE FOR. FLORA FOR SUCCESS I THINK THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS TO HELP OUT WHICH WOULD WORK IF THEY'RE FAIR OR IF WE SHOULD JUST. BASICALLY GO TO WHAT MARCH WHICH WE DID WITH LCF ACTRESS RECOGNIZE THE STUDENT POPULATION WHATEVER IT IS AND JUST FOCUS ON THAT AND I'M I'M PROBABLY MORE. ON THE. IT INCLINED THAT WAY SO I DON'T THINK THAT WE'RE YOU WORK YOU WORK WERE READY TO DO WHAT I'M DOING TODAY OBVIOUSLY BUT. AS FAR AS RIGHT NOW ANTHONY REVISED PROCESS TO IT TO EMBRACE THIS I'M. WHETHER IT'S LATER THIS SUMMER OR EVEN BUT DOWN THE ROAD I THINK THAT WE NEED TO HAVE. A BROADER STAKEHOLDER PROCESS YOU KNOW WITH. FACULTY AND ACADEMIC SENATE ENGAGED IN HELPING CRATER AND I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT WE SAW WITH LCF AT THE END OF THE DAY. EVERYONE'S IN FRONT OF US AMBER EMBRACING US SUCH A CONCEPT AT AND ALSO KNOW THAT THE CURRENT. CURRENT COMMITTEE BECAUSE APARTMENT FORMULA DOESN'T WORK FOR ANYBODY. SLOW DEATH. SPIRAL FOR SOME COMMITTEE CALL DISTRICTS THAT WE NEEDED KNOWLEDGE AS WELL SO. THERE'S JUST SOME OVER ARCHING. COMMENTS. THE START THIS MORNING. MISTER O'DONNELL BY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I AGREE WITH YOUR COMMENTS THERE AGAIN I MY MY BIGGEST CONCERN HERE IS THE WINNERS AND LOSERS. BUT MORE PARTLY Y. THEIR WINNERS AND LOSERS MAYBE YOU COULD SPEAK TO THAT. I'M. IT AND AND LOOK AT MY OWN LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE. I'M WILL THE LONGISH COLLEGE PROMISES WHICH IS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL PATH. TO YOUR KIDS OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL INTO COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND ON TO THE FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY. BUT WITHOUT IN A. OFTENTIMES THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY'RE NOT SUCCESSFUL. THEY BOUNCED INTO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DID WHAT THEY NEEDED YOU AND THEN BOUNCE OUR. IS MY UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY BE DOING BECAUSE IT OUR STUDENTS DIDN'T GET. THE A. SO YEAH MAYBE YOU CAN SPEAK TO THAT AND THEN WHAT IF I CHOSE TO GO TO A COMMUNICABLE JIM TAKE UP PHOTOGRAPHY COURSE. FOR FOR PERSONAL ENRICHMENT BUT ALSO SOME SKILLS. BUT THAT DIDN'T LEAD TO A DEGREE MAYBE I EVEN ALREADY HAVE A DEGREE WHERE WHERE DOES THAT. HOW DOES THAT PLAY INTO THE FORMULA CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH THE? SURE I AM SO WE DID RELEASE AND SOME RAT AS SOME FORMULA SIMULATIONS SWEET IT'S ABOUT YOUR PROJECTIONS. BASED ON THE VARIOUS AT FACTORS AND WHY SOME DISTRICTS ARE GROWING MORE THAN OTHERS. IS A COMBINATION OF AREAS. FACTORS TO SELL TYPICALLY DISTRICTS THAT SERVE THAT OUR HIGHEST AT A LOW INCOME STUDENTS ADAM AND TO HAVE THAT. HIGHS OUTCOMES TYPICALLY SEE. AB MORE GROWTH THAN THAT OTHER AYE AYE DISTRICTS. I OF COURSE THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT WE TRY TO ADDRESS THAT THE AA ISN'T THE ONLY ADDS SUCCESS AT METRIC AND THE MAY REVISION. PROPOSES AYE REVISIONS TO THOSE METRICS TO INCLUDE OTHER THINGS LIKE AB COMPLETION A TRANSFER LEVEL AT MATH AND ENGLISH COMPLETION OF A NINE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. AYE UNITS WHO ARE TRYING TO BALANCE AB BASED ON THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE RECOMMENDATIONS AYE THOSE DIFFERENT PROGRESS AND AYE. AYES SUCCESS AT METRICS AS PART OF THAT ANY OTHER COMPONENT TO IT IS THAT WE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A LOT OF ANSWERING UNCERTAINTY OVER THE TRANSITION. ONTO THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA. SO. WE EXTEND THAT THE HOLD HARMLESS AN ABSOLUTE HOLD HARMLESS FOR TWO YEARS. AT WHEN WE DID OUR PROJECTIONS. UP THAT WE RELEASED I WOULD NOTE THAT THESE ARE BASED ON JUST FIVE YEAR OUT PACK PRIOR YEAR FIVE YEAR AVERAGES OF THE DIFFERENT METRICS SO AS COLLEGES. I BEGIN TO AS THE MORE SUCCESS IN FRANCE AND IMPLEMENTING SEVEN A FIVE AND A STUDENTS OUT. OF A BAD COMPLETING TRANSFER LEVEL MATH AND ENGLISH WE SHOULD SEE THOSE SUCCESS METRICS INCREASED SO AGAIN THESE ARE PROJECTIONS AND THERE'S HERE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR COLLEGES AT TO GROW FISCALLY BY NOT JUST ARE ONLY MORE STUDENTS BUT BY. AYE MAKING PROGRESS ON THOSE VARIOUS METRICS. SO I AM. THAT'S CRAZY PUSHED OUT THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS BUT. SO YOU WAIT THREE YEARS AND YOU OFF A CLIFF ALSO DOING IS DELAYING THE INEVITABLE FOR SOME POTENTIALLY. BUT. MY ONE OF MY MAIN CONCERNS HERE IS VELOCITY. I I DON'T KNOW THAT EVERY THIS BUILDING HAS THE WORLD EXPERIENCE THAT OTHERS HAVE. I'VE MYSELF WAS A P. COLLEGE WHAT FOR FIVE YEARS I WORKED. IN A FULL TIME PART TIME. SO I AM MY TIMELINE TO GET OUT OF COMMUNICABLE IT'S WAS EXTENDED DUE TO PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES DOES THE FORMULA CONTEMPLATE THAT BECAUSE WE MIGHT HAVE STUDENTS THAT ARE ONLY. ABLE TO TAKE A CLASS IN YOUR THIS THE COLLEGE SHOULDN'T GET QUOTE UNQUOTE PUNISHED. FOR THAT. SURE. AND MAYBE TO MAKE A FEW BROADER POINTS THAT I YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO REITERATE FINANCES POINT THAT YOU KNOW THE. BUT THE PROPOSAL EXTENDS A HOLD HARMLESS FOR SECOND YEAR WE IMAGINE OVER THOSE TWO YEARS COLLEGES ARE CHANGING BEHAVIOR IN SUCH A WAY THAT. THE DATE ON THAT PIECE OF PAPER. ISN'T WOULDN'T BE NECESSARILY BE REFLECTIVE OF THE DATA USED TO CALCULATE FUNDING IN YOUR THREE WE THINK THAT. YOU KNOW THEY COR PROMISE OF THIS PROPOSALS THAT OUGHT BY IDENTICALLY REALLY IDENTIFYING THE OUTCOMES WE CARE ABOUT CLEAR IT PHILLY IDENTIFYING THE TYPES OF STUDENTS WE THINK FACE ESPECIALLY HIGH BARRIERS TO SUCCESS. THAT OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS COLLEGES ARE CHANGING BEHAVIOR IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE DATA THERE ISN'T REFLECTIVE SO I THINK FOR. DISTRICTS THAT IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IN NINETEEN TWENTY WOULD BE GUARANTEED AS MUCH AS THEY RECEIVED IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FOR THOSE FOR WHOM THAT THE FORMULA. DOESN'T CURRENTLY ARE PROJECTED GROWTH WE WE WOULD EXPECT AND WE WOULD HOPE THAT. THERE ARE. OUTCOMES THAT. YOU KNOW THAT THEIR OPTIMISM FOR IF I THINK THE SECOND POINT AROUND UMMC A CAN OF STUDENTS WHO TRANSFER WITHOUT ASSERTIVE ARE WITHOUT A DEGREE. OF THESE POPULATIONS OF STUDENTS I THINK WHAT. WE THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE UP BEGIN TO ALLIED WHAT'S USED IN FUNDING FOR THE VALUES THAT THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR HAVE ALREADY. HAVE ALREADY IDENTIFIED THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE HAVE MADE AYE ASSOCIATE DEGREES FOR TRANSFER A PRIORITY THAT WE THINK THERE ARE CLEAR BENEFITS TO A STUDENT WHO TRANCERS WITH AN ADT. VERSUS STUDENTS WHO TRANSFER OUT WITHOUT WHAT THE PAY GET BENEFITS AT AT THE CSU THAT NOW GET BENEFITS OF THE UC BENEFIT WITH THEY GET THERE'S NO REASON TO GET IN A FEW GO. GONNA BE A WE ALL KNOW THAT THEY HAVE PAID IT BUT I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE OVER THAT THERE IS NO READ TO SPEND MORE TIME GETTING A. ACTUALLY DEFEATS YOUR GOAL WHICH IS REALLY VELOCITY I THINK. YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT SOME WHERE WE GOT VOLUME RIGHT AND THE GUYS ARE INTERESTED VELOCITY BUT AGAIN I'M STILL STUCK ON. PEOPLE HAVE PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO GET THROUGH A DEGREE IN FOUR YEARS I THINK SOME PEOPLE IN THIS BUILDING ARE LIVING IN A DIFFERENT WORLD LOT PEOPLE WORK HERE RIGHT FRANKLIN. DID THAT THEY HAVE THE FINANCIAL WHEREWITHAL. THEY IS THE MEANS TO DO THAT BUT NOT EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD HAS THAT SITUATION SO WHAT WHAT ANYTIME MUCH CHANGING BEHAVIOR WHAT BEHAVIOR ARE YOU TRYING TO CHANGE. THE U. TRYING TO CHANGE THE BEHAVIOR OF THE COLLEGE OR THE STUDENT I DON'T KNOW THAT. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE GONNA INCENTIVIZE A STUDENT TO GET THROUGH IT FOR YEARS WHEN THEY'VE GOT YOU HAVE CHILDREN AT HOME A JOB THEY'VE GOT TO PAY RENT. HE GOT A PAPER FOOD I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS FORMULA IS GOING TO ADDRESS THAT AND I WOULD SAY BUT CLEARLY THE COLLEGE I THINK THE HEAT CONTENT OF THE BEHAVIOR CHANGES AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL AROUND. DEVELOPMENTAL EDUCATION AROUND HOW STUDENTS ARE PLACED INTO GUIDED PATHWAYS AROUND HOW STUDENTS ARE ADVISED TO DEGREES SO I THINK. FOCUSING ON. A CREATING INCENTIVES FOR INSTITUTIONS TO CLEARLY FOCUS ON EDUCATIONAL GOALS INSTANCES I THINK THE INTENT OF AFFIRMATIVE. WHAT ABOUT VELOCITY ABOUT? CAN I BE SPENT EARNING USE THAT AS THAT CONTEMPLATED IN THE FORMULA IT IS A CLEAR PART OF OUR VISION FOR SUCCESS OUR VISION FOR SUCCESS SINCE TOO MANY STUDENTS TAKE MORE UNITS THAN THEY NEED TO. SO YES I THINK VELOCITY. YOU KNOW WE DON'T. SPECIFY A TIME PERIOD BUT I THINK A V. FORMULA CREATES A CLEAR INCENTIVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET STUDENTS OUT. APPROPRIATELY IN ED. AS FAST AS THEY CAN AND AND I I I AGREE WITH THAT. BUT I AGAIN AND I'M STILL CONCERNED THERE'S. SOME KIND OF. YOU KNOW. DISINCENTIVE EVEN TAKE ON THE STUDENT IS GOING TO TAKE A. A PROJECTED PATH TO A DEGREE WITH WITH THESE TYPES OF FORMULAS. AND TO HELP THEM TOWARD SUCCESS BECAUSE ALL WE WE JUST ONE PHILOSOPHY WHICH IS WHAT THE LOS. I WOULD ARE RIGHT I THINK THEY'RE SEXY LEFT OF THAT. THAT ASPECT IN THIS IT WITH ME RIVETED IN PART BECAUSE. IN THE JANUARY PROPOSAL HAD SOME AWARD AMOUNT JUST SORT HOW MANY AWARDS DO YOU ISSUE IF YOU'RE. THE SECOND PIECE WAS A AWARD WITHIN THREE YEARS SO THAT WAS A LOT MORE PRIOR TO THIS IN GETTING FOLKS OUT IN THREE YEARS. THIS PROPOSAL DOESN'T HAVE THAT COMPONENT WERE TIGHTENING IT BE FUN. AT A THREE YEAR MARK THAT DOES SORT OF IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THERE BEING THE TH. THAT BUT YOUR YOUR AWARDS ARE GOING TO DISINFECT BY THE COLLEGE FROM REALLY PROVIDING GOOD SERVICE TO SOMEBODY'S APARTMENT DOMESTIC THERE'S A LITTLE BIT LEFT IN THIS PROPOSAL BUT I DO THINK THAT. IF YOU GET YOUR GENERAL COMMENTS THE GUARD PART OF WHY I THINK WE HAVE TO GET THE PERHAPS THINKING A LOT MORE TIME TO REVIEW THAT THAT THE DATA BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME. IMPLICIT SORT OF A THING THAT WE GET WILL TRY TO INCENTIVIZE THROUGH THIS FOR THE RIGHT ONE OF THE FACTORS IS THAT THE THE IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT HOW MUCH. PERFORMANCE BASED FUNDING A COLLEGE WOULD GET THEY GET MORE FUNDING FOR AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER. ARE A LITTLE BIT LESS FOR AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE AND THEN LEFT THE MAP FOR A TRIP FOR A TRANSFER WITH NO DEGREE. I THINK THAT THE REASON THAT THERE ARE SOME REASONS YOU WHAT MIGHT WANT TO DO THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO. ENCOURAGE IN A THIRTY DEGREE FOR TRANSFER BECAUSE THAT MIGHT HELP STUDENTS FIND ACT AUTHORED BY UNIVERSITY HAVE MORE OPTIONS FOR WHAT WE'RE COLLEGES THAT COULD USE WHEN THEY'RE TRANSFERRING. YOU MIGHT WANT TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT IF FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY DROP OUT THEY HAVE A DEGREE THERE ARE SOME REASON WE WANT TO THAT BUT I THINK. IT HAVING SOMETIME DIRECT THINK ABOUT HIS AFFECTS. THE FACT THE FORMULA PROBLEMS DIFFERENT. AMOUNTS EFFECT FROM I THINK IT'S WOULD BE GOOD TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY IS SORT OF ON THE SAME PAGE AND UNDERSTAND. THEM PERFECT THANK YOU BYE SO STUDENTS CAN ANYONE UP HERE TELL ME WHY ONE WOULD WANT TO GET IN THIS IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE PLANNING ON GOING TO. SAY THEIR LONG WE SEE COLLEGE OF PLANNING ON ALONG THE STATE WHY THEY WOULD WANT TO GET IN A A. AND NOT JUST TRANSFER OVER TO LONG BEACH STATE LIKE I DIDN'T GET AN A I TRANSFERRED OVER I THINK SO WHY WOULD I WON A AS OPPOSED TO JUST TRANSFERRED OVER SPECIFIC ENTRANCE ROVER QUICKER. ALL JUMP IN WITH THREE REASONS. FIRST THAT. IF YOU TRANSFER THE NECESSITY FOR TRANSFER YOUR GUARANTEED ADMISSION OF ARE YOU AT BUT DON'T IF YOU MEET THE TRANCE REQUIREMENTS DON'T YOU GET. WELL YOU DON'T HAVE THAT SAME GUARANTEES THAT YOU'RE GUARANTEED ADMISSION TO THE CSU SYSTEM YOUR PREFERENCES AND THE LOCAL CAMPUS WHO I LIKE WE HAVE THE COLLEGE PROMISE IN LONG BEACH WE'VE GOT THAT. I THINK IN GENERAL SO ON A STATEWIDE BASIS I THINK IN PLACES WHERE THERE HAVEN'T BEEN THAT. CLEAR PATHWAY FROM OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO THE C. I THINK I'M. A* UP PRESENTS A BENEFIT THERE PA UNDER THE STATUTE BUT THE CSU. YOU ARE YOU HAVE TO TAKE NO MORE THAN SIXTEEN UNITS SO I THINK THERE'S A COMMITMENT TO CHECK IT OUT A FASTER TIME TO DEGREE AT THE CSU. AND I THINK FOR STUDENTS TO. UPON TRANSFER WHO MAY NOT FINISH A BACHELOR'S DEGREE I THINK HAVING A CREDENTIAL. HAS CLEAR LABOR MARKET BENEFITS PERSONS HAVING SOME COLLEGE BUT NO DEGREE. IT DOESN'T REALLY SOUGHT REASONS BECAUSE. I I JUST DON'T FIND THOSE TO BE REAL SOLID REASONS I APOLOGIZE BUT I JUST. I DON'T THINK THIS IS THOUGHT THROUGH WHEN THEY'RE ALTERNATE CALL. TO GET A BA AND HOPEFULLY EVEN AN A OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I DON'T I DON'T. I I'VE NEVER HAD ANYONE ASK ME FOR MY A. I'VE HAD PLENTY OF PEOPLE ASK ME FOR MY BA. THANK YOU THANK YOU JUST YEAH CHAIRMAN OF I MEAN. WILL CHAIRMAN YOU ARE CHAIRMAN OF THE EDUCATION YOU'RE THE CHAIR THERE THAT'S RIGHT I DON'T KNOW THAT I WENT TO LONG BEACH STATE UNIVERSITY LIFE YOU. TRANSFERRED FROM MERRICK RIVER COMMUNITY COLLEGE RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD HERE. GOT MY FIFTY SIX UNITS DIDN'T GO FOR THE A A BECAUSE BY DOING GETTING THE A WHAT IF ANOTHER SEMESTER. WASTING AROUND AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE I KNOW THAT'S RIGHT UNDERSTAND WE'RE GETTING MORE TIME AND. IN DIFFERENT PLACES THANK YOU SO. A GOOD POINT. OKAY. WE WILL. I SEE TO THE NEXT ITEM ISSUE NUMBER THREE. IS THERE SAM. VARIOUS COMMUNITY CALLS PROPOSALS AND MAYBE YOU CAN JUST RUN THROUGH THESE REALLY FAST. SO I JUST HAD LATE SEVERAL NEW INVESTMENTS FOR THE COMMUNICATIVE AS AN AREA OF FINANCIAL AID AT THE MAYOR REVISION PROPOSES SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. UP FOR THE PROPOSED STUDENT SUCCESS COMPLETION GRANT TO REFLECT INCREASE ESTIMATES OF ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. AS WELL AS THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION ONE TIME AND FIVE MILLION ONGOING PROPOSITION EIGHTY GENERAL FUND. TO ALLOW COLLEGES TO OPERATE THEIR FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS FOR MORE EFFICIENT PROCESSING OF AN ENTRY TO STUDENTS. THE MAYOR. IT'S WOMAN COMMUNICATOR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AS WELL AS AN INCREASE OF FIVE POINT NINE MILLION ONE TIME I PROPOSITION EIGHTY GENERAL FUND A BACK FOR SHORTFALLS IN RELATED. AND SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION HOURS THE PRIOR YEAR AND THIS IS JUST CONSISTENT WITH OUR GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL WHICH IS UPDATE AT THE ESTIMATE BASED ON. UPDATED I AM ARE IS AYE HOURS AND OTHER FACTORS. THE MERE VISION ALSO INCLUDES AN INCREASE AT SIX MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION EIGHTY GENERAL FUND TO EXPAND THE DEVELOPMENT OF OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE MAYOR VISION INCLUDES ADAM AN INCREASE OF FIVE MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO EXPAND THE NECKS UP PROGRAM WHICH SUPPORTS CURRENT AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH AND THIS WOULD ALLOW THE PROGRAM TO EXPAND TO TWENTY. AT COMMUNICATES DISTRICTS. AND THE LOTS ADJUSTMENT I WILL HIGHLIGHT IS A ONCE A SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE WORK AROUND THE COURSE IDENTIFICATION NUMBERING SYSTEM. AB THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER CUTTING. LA OF ANY THOUGHTS OR CONCERNS WITH THESE PROPOSALS YES SURE INVOLVED WITH% THEM WE DID HAVE THAT I THINK ARE ARE NOW OFF WITHIN ON PAGE TWENTY TWO FIGURE ELEVEN WE HAVE A SUMMARY OF ALL OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE MAY REVISION PROPOSALS I WON'T GO INTO. ALL OF THE DETAILS I JUST HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THEM BETTER BETTER NEW PROPOSALS. UNRELATED TO THE FINANCIALLY TECHNOLOGY. WHEW IT'S FIVE MILLION ONGOING THIRTEEN HAVE MILLION ONE TIME WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE PROPOSAL WE THINK THIS IS THE KIND OF. THROUGH A BASE OPERATIONS ACTIVITIES THAT SHOULD BE FUNDED WITH APPORTIONMENT. I'M THREE HUNDRED PROJECT ARA RECOMMEND REJECTING THAT AND THEN ON THE OPEN EDUCATION RESOURCES TOM WE RECOMMEND ADOPTING IT BUT WE ACTUALLY JUST RECOMMEND THAT. FOR THE NEXT FIRST THREE YEARS THAT THERE ARE SOME ANNUAL REPORTS ON WHAT'S GOING ON WITH IT. WITHOUT FUNDING TO GET A BETTER SENSE THAT HAVE BETTER OVERSIGHT OF WHAT'S GOING ON. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT ANY OF THAT THE QUICKLY. THANK YOU WERE SUPPORTIVE OF. PROPOSALS WE THINK WE THINK BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNOR THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE FOR INCLUDING EXCESS COMPLETION GREAT THANK YOU. NO QUESTIONS ON THESE ITEMS WILL RULE THAT. HAVE A. RESPONSE IN OUR PLAN NEXT WEEK. WE'LL PROCEED NOW WITH THE UC. MAY REVISE. PROPOSAL. NUMBER FOUR. OKAY BERMAN FINANCE. GOOD MORNING JAX WELL DEPARTMENT FINANCE. BEFORE I GET INTO THE MAY REVISION PROPOSALS I WOULD LIKE TO AGAIN HIGHLIGHT THE. NINETY ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN THE UC MADE A GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THIS REPRESENTS A SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENT IN HIGHER EDUCATION THAT. YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE MAINTAINED IN THE MADE PROVISION. THE FIRST INITIAL DISCUSSES THE FIFTY MILLION WITH HELD IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUDGET ACT. AT THAT WOULD BE RELEASED CONTINGENT ON THE UC IMPLEMENTING THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STATE AUDITOR. COMPLETING ACTIVITY BASED COSTING ACTIVITY BASED COSTING PILOTS. ATTAINING A TRANSFER RATIO OF TO ENTERING FRESHMEN STUDENTS FOR EVERY WHEN TRANSFER STUDENT. ENDING SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT PAYMENTS TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT NEW SCENE SENIOR MANAGER GROUP EMPLOYEES. AND RELEASING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE FINANCES. THE UC HAS SUBMITTED EVIDENCE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REGARDING THEIR PROGRESS ON THESE GOALS AND UPON REVIEWING THIS EVIDENCE WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE UC HAS MADE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT. TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUDGET ACT. HOWEVER I SOME PIECES OF. THIS AGREEMENT. ARE PENDING IN THE MAY REGION'S MEANING SPECIFICALLY IN REGARDS TO CERTAIN DISCLOSURES OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRESENTATION OF BUDGET THAT WE WILL REVIEW. AT THE REGENTS MEETING LATER THIS MONTH. OUR NEXT PROPOSAL AYE IT REGARDING EASY PATH. EASY PATH AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS GOING TO BE THE POINT TWO ADDITIONAL CAMPUSES. OUT OF THIS BUDGET MAINTAINS THE PRACTICE OF TO DIRECTLY APPROPRIATE. FOR THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE C. PATH PROJECT HOWEVER IN LIGHT OF THESE. ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT. WE HAVE INCLUDED PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW THE UC TO RETURN FOR A FEE FOR SERVICE FOR THIS INCREMENTAL FIFTEEN POINT THREE MILLION NEEDED TO EXPAND. AND POOR THIS PROJECT I IF YOU SEE DETERMINES THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDS ARE NEEDED TO COMPLETE. EASY PATH RELATED WORK IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THEY CRITICIZE ADDITIONAL FUNDS BUT ONLY AFTER RECEIVING. APPROVAL FROM BOTH THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE AND THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. THE MAYOR OF MAYOR VISION ALSO INCLUDES FIFTY FIVE MILLION FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION FOR PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS. FORTY MILLION WOULD BE. PROVIDED FOR THE UC TO EXPAND THEIR RESIDENCY PROGRAM SERVING UNDERSERVED AND RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE THAT DESPERATELY NEED ADDITIONAL. HOT PSYCHIATRISTS AND OTHER MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. FIFTEEN MILLION WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY THE UC AS A STATEWIDE GRANT PROGRAM OPEN TO ALL. ACCREDITED RESIDENCY PROGRAMS THAT SERVE UNDERSERVED RURAL AREAS. THESE FUNDS ARE INTENDED TO SUPPORT RESIDENTS OF THE ENTIRE TERM OF THEIR RESIDENCY. AND AS SUCH WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR FOR MULTIPLE YEARS. OTHER MAJOR REVISION ALSO INCLUDES A ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR ANTI BIAS TRAINING AT THE UC NC IS HERE TO COMBAT THE RISING NUMBER OF HATE INCIDENTS ON OUR UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES. AND A MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE INSTITUTE ON GLOBAL CONFLICT AND COOPERATION OUGHT TO SUPPORT ITS RESEARCH OPERATIONS. DO YOU SEE THAT THE MIRROR VISION ALSO INCLUDES LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE SHOULD THE UC RAISE TUITION AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. TO REDIRECT A CORRESPONDING AMOUNT OF UC'S MAIN APPROPRIATION TO SUPPORT CAL GRANT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH. I END OF CLASS SCHOLARSHIP COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A TUITION INCREASE. FINALLY THEM A REVISION INCLUDES ONE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THEY HAVE A A LARGE DEMONSTRATED NEED. AND WE FEEL THIS WOULD MAKE A AYE AT A CRITICAL IMPACT ON THAT NEED I'M WILLING TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU ALEJO JASON CONCENTRA ROSOLINO. I'LL BE WALKING YOU THROUGH SEVERAL OF THE ITEMS THAT YOU ARE BEFORE YOU TODAY ON AND TO DO THAT I'LL BE WALKING THROUGH. I REPORT THAT ON MY COLLEAGUE EARLIER INTRODUCED YOU. ON THIS FIRST ISSUE ALT ALTERNATE AGENDA PAGE TWENTY NINE THAT LISTS ALL OF THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION PROPOSALS FOR YOU SEE AND ASSOCIATED RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR THE SAKE OF TIME ON A WALK THROUGH OF WHAT WE THINK ARE KIND OF THREE BIG ONES FOR YOU YOU WERE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ANY OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS. THAT YOU SEE IN THIS TABLE. THE FIRST ALL WALK YOU THROUGH IS THE REPERCUSSIONS OF FOR THE TUITION INCREASE. OUT WE UNDERSTAND THE GOVERNOR A IN THIS PROPOSAL WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO IS LINK TUITION DECISIONS IN GENERAL FUND DECISIONS TOGETHER IT'S APPROACH WE'VE. OURSELVES ONE RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE TAKE. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T WANT TO INCREASE TUITION AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE THINK SUCH LANGUAGE COULD BE WARRANTED. BUT WE ARE ACTION RECOMMEND GOING EVEN FURTHER THAN IT DID THE ADMINISTRATION THOUGH RATHER THAN JUST THINKING OF A REDUCTION INTO A GENERAL FUND TO THE ASSOCIATED CAL GRANT NO CLASS SCHOLARSHIP. A INCREASES WE RECOMMEND YOU CONSIDER DOING A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR FOR ADOPTION SO THE INC DISSOCIATED INCREASE IN TUITION REVENUE YOU REDUCE THE GENERAL FUND BY THAT AMOUNT. THAT WOULD PROVIDE A STRONGER INCENTIVE AND ALSO ENSURE THAT ANY JEWISH INCREASES UNCOVERING ANY OTHER COSTS THAT YOU HADN'T HAD A. PRIORITIZE FOR THE UNIVERSITY IN THAT YEAR. WE ALSO KNOW THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT TUITION IS OFF THE TABLE FOR YOU THIS YEAR ANY OTHER INCREASE WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROVIDE ABOVE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WHICH WOULD HAVE TO COME FROM THE GENERAL FUND. THE SECOND ISSUE OUR WE WANT TO WALK YOU THROUGH AS TO ITS KIND OF FIVE DOWN ON THAT TABLE THERE TO PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAMS ISSUE. WE THINK THIS ISSUE RAISES A LOT OF QUESTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE. ALL THE FIRST IS WHETHER OR NOT. SAIKIA SITE YET A PSYCHIATRIC PROGRAMS ARE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR YOU THIS YEAR. OTHER CONCERNS THAT OF FROM MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF SPECIALTY AREAS OF THEIR SHORTAGES BOTH STATEWIDE IN REGIONALLY YOU FOR THE PAST HEARD CONCERNS ABOUT PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS FOR EXAMPLE. SO THIS IS A QUESTION FOR YOU WHETHER OR NOT THE SPECIALTY AREA IS YOUR HIGHEST PRIORITY. TO THE EXTENT IT IS A THEN RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE UNDERLYING AYE IF YOU HEAR IS WHAT MIGHT WE SEE THE SHORTAGES RIGHT NOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS ARGUING TO INCREASE OF MORE SLOTS FOR RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. BUT IN THE STATE IN THE PAST THE STATUS TRIED OTHER AMOUNT MECHANISMS TO SUCH AS LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAMS RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION PROGRAMS. ALMOND SO THEY RAISE THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS REALLY SORT OF THE BEST POLICY LEVER THAT YOU HAVE IN PLACE. AND THEN THE THIRD ISSUE IS WHETHER OR NOT. THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS IS A PIPELINE ISSUE IN THAT THEY'RE MORE SPOTS THAT ARE NEEDED BY THEIR NOT. A ONE TIME AUGMENTATION IS REALLY THE BEST SOLUTION HERE OR SOMETHING ONGOING IS MORE WARRANTED. NOT SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR YOU THIS YEAR INTO THE SEND THAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE YOU CAN I GET A HANDLE ON THIS BEFORE AND TIME FOR BUDGET CLOSE OUT. WE DO SOME OTHER SUGGESTIONS THAT THAT COULD IMPROVE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. ALL THE FIRST IS TO MAKE ALL THE FUNDING COMPETITIVE CURRENTLY THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSING TO GIVE FORTY TWO YOU SEE AND FIFTEEN FOR GRANT PROGRAM. WE THINK IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO MAKE THE WHOLE OUTFIT FIFTH OF FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM COMPETITIVE GRANTS SO THAT IT REALLY TARGETED TOWARDS THOSE. A PROGRAMS THAT ARE ADDRESSING THE HIGHEST NEED. SECONDLY WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER A ADMINISTRATE ADMINISTERING THIS PROGRAM THROUGH AN INDEPENDENT BODY RATHER THAN YOU SEE TO ENSURE NO PREFERENCES GIVEN TO YOU SEE PROGRAMS. AND YOU COULD USE AN EXISTING BODY FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE OF THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING DEVELOPMENT. ADMINISTERS A SUMMER PROGRAM FOR PRIMARY CARE SO THAT'S ONE PROGRAM YOU COULD CONSIDER. WE ALSO RECOMMEND SOME ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND THAT IT YOU FURTHER CAPITA MINISTRY OF COST WE THINK THE TEN PERCENT CAP IS A BIT HIGH FIVE PERCENT OR SIX PERCENT WOULD BE A MORE REASONABLE. AT PROGRAM. THE FINAL THING I WOULD TOUCH ON IN OUR CHART IS OF TOWARDS THE BOTTOM YOU'LL SEE SOMETHING FOR YOU SEE PATH OPERATIONS AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT THIS COMMITTEE DISCUSSED UP IN A PRIOR HEARING AS YOU RECALL. A YOU SEE PATH IS A PROJECT FROM THE UNIVERSITY TO INTEGRATE ALL OF ITS HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS INTO ONE INTEGRATED SYSTEM. AT A PRIOR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN OF THE PROGRAM IS FUNDED BY THE A CHARGES ON THE CAMPUSES. IT THOUGH PROGRAMS ROLLED INTO THE USE YOUR P. LINE ITEM AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BY THE LEGISLATURE. I THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO BUDGET FOR THE PROGRAM. IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. WE ARE BOTH BY A COMBINATION OF A LINE ITEM AND CAMPUS CHARGES WE THINK THAT. A PROPOSALS OF UNNECESSARILY COMPLEX WE THINK A BETTER A MORE RATIONAL APPROACH WOULD BE TO JUST STICK WITH ONE EITHER A LINE ITEM OR CAMPUS CHARGES. AT THE MOMENT WE DO SEE SOME ADVANTAGES TO IT GOING BACK TO A USER FEE MODEL THE SYSTEM DOES ON THE PROJECT SERVICE UPRIGHT SERVICES TO CAMPUSES THE CAMPUSES MIGHT BE. MORE INCENTIVIZE TO INTERACT WITH THAT PROGRAM AND RETIRED CONTROL COSTS IF THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING THE COST OF THE PROGRAM. REGARDLESS OF WHATEVER APPROACH YOU TAKE WOULD YOU RECOMMEND A RETHINKING THE STATE'S A SHARE OF THE PROJECTS COSTS CURRENTLY THE STATE PAYS FOR THE ENTIRE PROJECT BUT THE PROJECT REALLY SERVING PARA UNIVERSITY. OF NOT JUST THE GENERAL CAMPUS BUT ALSO THE HOSPITAL'S OTHER SORT OF AUXILIARY SYSTEMS OF THE OF THE ON. OF THE SYSTEM SO WE RECOMMEND ADOPTING A. CENTER POLICY TO SHARE THE COST BETWEEN OF THE STATE AND NON STATE FUNCTIONS OF THE UNIVERSITY WE HAVE A FEW THOUGHTS ON THAT IF IF YOU'D LIKE TO EXPORT THAT FURTHER. WILL ALSO REMAIN CONCERNED OF LONG TERM WITH THE PROJECT SORT OF ESCALATING COSTS RECOMMEND REGARDLESS OF WHATEVER ACTION YOU TAKE BUT YOU CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE PROGRAM VIGOROUSLY CONTINUE TO HAVE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS TO ENSURE THAT. COSTS ARE JUSTIFIED AND THAT THERE ARE SAVINGS ARE BEING PRODUCED AS A RESULT OF THE PROGRAM. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ON THIS A THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU. YOU SEE. SAVOR TENANT OF THIS IS ON. SAVOR ATTENDED UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA UP THINK YOU MISTER TURNER MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. REGARDING THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL THE GOVERNOR FOR THESE FUNDS ON HIS RECOGNITION BUT YOU SEE STRUGGLING WITH MAINTENANCE OF OUR AGING FACILITIES. THE PROPOSED FUNDS WILL ALLOW CAMPUSES TO ADDRESS THE MOST CRITICAL OF OUR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ISSUES INCLUDING FAILING PLUMBING. A LEAKING ROOFS AND OTHER MAJOR SYSTEMS THE EXACT ALLOCATION TO EACH CAMPUS HAS NOT YET BEEN DETERMINED BUT IN THE PAST WHEN WE HAVE. ALLOCATED DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING TO CAMPUSES. OF WE EXPECT THAT THE CAMPUS ALLOCATION WILL BE BASED ON A COMBINATION OF FACTORS. INCLUDING THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF STATE ELIGIBLE SPACE AND THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE A SQUARE ESTATE ELIGIBLE SPEECH SPACE ON EACH CAMPUS. OF EACH CAMPUS WILL BE ASKED TO SUBMIT THEIR HIGHEST PRIORITY PROJECTS TO UC OP FOR THAT ALLOCATION PROCESS SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO PROVIDE THESE FUNDS YOU SEE WHICH. WE VERY MUCH REQUEST THAT YOU DO OF WE HAVE WE HAVE NEED FOR THOSE. OF. THE SERGEANT HAS PASSED OUT A HANDOUT. AND ALL BE WALKING YOU THROUGH THOSE THROUGH THIS FOR SOME OF THE OTHER A GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS. REGARDING THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE I WANTED TO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT FOR YOU. UC REGENTS HAVE NOT YET DECIDED TO VOTE ON THE TUITION INCREASE. THEY'VE DELAYED THERE MAY OUGHT TUITION INCREASE VOTE. OF SO THAT WE COULD WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING WE CONTINUE TO REQUEST THE LEGISLATURE FOR SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN LIEU OF TUITION AND STUDENT SERVICES FEE BUYOUT. WE HAVE PROPOSED A NET TUITION INCREASE OF TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT DOLLARS PER STUDENT AND AN INCREASE OF FIFTY FOUR DOLLARS ON THE STUDENT SERVICES FREE. PER STUDENT. I CALTRANS COVER TUITION INCREASES FOR THE LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS WHO QUALIFY FOR CAL GRANT. CURRENTLY ON THE EXPENDITURES FOR INSTRUCTION YOU CAN SEE THAT ON SLIGHT THREE OF YOUR DOC. A CALTRANS COVER ABOUT TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY DOLLARS OF OUR PER STUDENT EXPENDITURES FOR INSTRUCTION SO THAT'S THE COMPONENT OF THE GOVERNOR. A IS TRYING TO ADDRESS WITH HIS BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE. AND WE CONTINUE TO RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDE US WITH THE SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO INCREASE TUITION TO COVER ANY OF OUR BASIC COSTS. REGARDING THE GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSAL FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION WHICH IS SAME AS MEDICAL RESIDENCY AS WE CONTINUE TO REQUEST. OF THAT THE FORTY MILLION THAT FORTY MILLION DOLLARS BE PROVIDED A TO SWAP OUT THE DO. REVERSED THE PROP FIFTY SIX SWAP THAT WAS PROVIDED IN. THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET AND ONGOING SO WE'RE REQUESTING THAT THE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS BE PROVIDED TO YOU SEE ON AN ONGOING BASIS. PROVIDING THE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS TO YOU SEE IT WILL ALLOW US TO PROVIDE THE FIVE PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDS OUT AS GRANTS AROUND THE STATE FOR MEDICAL RESIDENCIES AND UNDERSERVED AREAS. AS INTENDED BY THE VOTERS APPROVE PROPOSITIONS. IN ADDITION WE WELCOME THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED ONE TIME INVESTMENT IN PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCIES FOR UNDERSERVED RURAL AREAS. GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION. COSTS APPROXIMATELY HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PRESS AND MEDICAL RESIDENT AND PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY IS ABOUT FOUR YEARS LONG TO PROVIDE YOU SOME. UP CONTEXT FOR THOSE FUNDS. YOU SEE HAS THE CAPACITY TO CONDUCT A GRANT PROGRAM FIRST A FOR A STATE WHERE GRANT PROGRAM. OF USUALLY ARE APPROXIMATE GRANT MANAGEMENT COSTS IS A ABOUT FIVE PERCENT THE GOVERNOR HAS GENEROUSLY PROVIDED US WITH A TEN PERCENT GAP. SOME OF THOSE FUNDS WOULD GO TOWARDS ACTUALLY GETTING THE PROGRAM STARTED AND HIRING UP HIRING THE STAFF DOING PROGRAM EVALUATION AND UP POSSIBLY AUDIT AT THE END. AND IT ALSO TAKES ABOUT A YEAR TO OF RECEIVE APPROVAL FOR NEW PSYCHIATRIC OR ANY MEDICAL RESIDENCY UP SLOTS. FROM THEIR CREDITING BODY SO IF THE APPROVAL DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXIST THERE MAY BE A DELAY. IN. FILING THE APPLICATION AND RECEIVING THAT APPROVAL TO THEFT MAY CREATE SOME DELAYS. IN GETTING A PROGRAM STARTED. IN RECORDS TWO D. REDIRECTION FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH. AB NINETY SEVEN THE BUDGET OCT TWENTY SEVENTEEN STATED THAT UC SHOULD FIND FUNDING FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND OTHER SOURCES TO FUND FIFTEEN HUNDRED NEW CALIFORNIA RESIDENT STUDENTS. DURING THIS LAST FALL UC OP MET WITH. MULTIPLE LEGISLATIVE STAFF DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS WELL. TO EXAMINE WHICH OF UC OPIES PROGRAMS COULD BE UP SELECTED FOR REDIRECTION. THE ITEM IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY AS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR IS THE RESULT OF THAT DISCUSSION TO PROVIDE THE FUNDS THE CAMPUSES. FOR FUNDING THOSE STUDENTS SO WE WE REQUEST APPROVAL. SEEM. WE'RE ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S ANTI BIAS TRAINING AND CENTER FOR GLOBAL CONFLICT AND COOPERATION. LET ME MOVE ON TO SLIGHT. OF FIVE WHICH DEALS WITH YOU SEE PASS THAT THE MORE SIDE MORE COMPLICATED ISSUE. OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW US TO COVER ALL OF THE OPERATIONAL COSTS FOR YOU SEE PATH. A IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT OF WITHOUT THESE SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO COVER THE COST FOR YOU SEE PAST WE WOULD BE. STUCK WITH COVERING TO. OF WILL BE. WE WOULD HAVE TO COVER THE OPERATIONAL COSTS BOARD BOTH UC PATH AND SOME OF THE CAMPUS LEGACY SYSTEMS WHICH ARE. A VERY OLD AND IN DANGER OF FAILING. UC POTS WILL ALLOW US TO. A CREATE. STANDARD BEST A BUSINESS SYSTEMS ACROSS THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES. AND THUS ARM ALSO ALLOW FOR EASIER. DATA ANALYSIS AND OF MANY OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT. OF. WILL BE BENEFICIAL. SO SLIDES FIVE SHOWS YOU THE DEPLOYMENT SEQUENCE FOR YOU SEE PAST THAT OF WE ARE PROPOSING AT THIS POINT. I'M GETTING THE UP ADDITIONAL FUNDS AS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR WILL ALLOW US TO. CONTINUE ON SCHEDULE AND BRING TO ADDITIONAL CAMPUSES ON. ON TO THE UC PASSED SYSTEM. SLIDE SIX SHOWS HOW WE INTEND TO SPEND THOSE FUNDS AND THE VARIOUS CATEGORIES. FOR OF THE EXPENDITURES WITHIN THE UC PATH. I'M. AND. THEN. LIKE I STATED PREVIOUSLY IF WE DON'T GET THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS AS PROPOSED. BY THE GOVERNOR THROUGH THE ASSESSMENT. WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BRING ON THOSE ADDITIONAL CAMPUSES. ON THE UC PATH AND. THERE WOULD BE AN INVESTMENT THAT. OF. WOULD NOT BE. FULLY UTILIZED BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN BUILDING UP TO TOWARD THIS. IT'S WE'RE HOPING FOR APPROVAL FROM THE LEGISLATURE ON THAT ITEM AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU ALL OF I HAVE A QUESTION A NOT FOR BURKE FOR YOU SEE I KNOW WE HAD. A LENGTHY HEARING A FEW. MONTHS AGO ON ON THE THESE ISSUES AND WE'LL COME BACK WITH OUR PLAN IT IN THAT IN A FEW DAYS I DO WONDER BAD AND THEY WERE IN HERE ABOUT THE PUBLIC COMMENT I'M SURE TO. FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON AND THE. FRANKLY IT'S NOT REALLY THAT YOU SEE ISSUE BUT AS YOU SEE IT THAT THE HEALTH ISSUE THE GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION THE PROP FIFTY SIX. AND THE DISAPPOINTMENT THAT IT IS NOT FULLY FUNDED. IN THE BUDGET BUT THEY DO HAVE THAT THEIR PROPOSAL FOR ROUGHLY THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY. FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION ALBEIT FOR. PACIFIC COHORT. WHY DIDN'T DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IT KNOWING THAT THERE'S SO MUCH? AND ANGST ABOUT THE PROP FIFTY SIX. PLAN LAST YEAR AND A HALF IN THE BUDGET. TAKE THAT SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY AND. AND. BASICALLY FOLLOW UP WITH THAT COMMITMENT THAT THE VOTERS MAY WHEN THEY VOTED FOR PROPERTY SIX. I'M MISTER GRAY CHU REASONS I'VE FIRST THIS PROPOSAL FOR PSYCHIATRIC MEDICAL. GREATER MEDICAL EDUCATION IS ONE TIME. WE HAVE. JET YOU WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE STATE'S LONG TERM FISCAL HEALTH. WE HAVE RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN THIS FISCAL YEAR THAT CAN SUPPORT THIS. AS OPPOSED TO. UNDOING THE HAVE THE FUN SHIFT FOR PROP FIFTY SIX THAT WOULD BE AN ONGOING SPENDING COMMITMENT. SECOND THIS IS PART OF A A LARGER MENTAL HEALTH AND HOMELESSNESS PACKAGE. THAT. WE'RE COLLABORATING WITH OUR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES COLLEAGUES ON. I GET THAT BUT. DO YOU DISAGREE. THAT. THAT THAT THE PROP FIFTY SIX AND THEN PROMISED. TO THE ELECTORATE VOTED FOR IT WAS TO HAVE. AN ADDITIONAL FIFTEEN MILLION FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION NOT SUPPLANT. ARE WE BELIEVE THAT'S. THE FUN SHIP THAT'S REFLECTED IN BOTH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL AND THE MAYOR EFFICIENT AS A REASON LISA FUNDS AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LANGUAGE PROPERTY SEX. OKAY FAIR ENOUGH. ALRIGHTY THANK YOU. NEXT WILL PROCEEDS. WITH ISSUE NUMBER FIVE. IS THAT I REQUEST THAT THE COMMITTEE CONSIDER. ARE THEY HERE. SO. KIM S.. I REQUEST A COMMITTEE BROWN ASKED ME THREE TO NINETY NINE. FOR. LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET RELATED TO VEHICLE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY DATA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OUT FIRST LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR AGENDA I THINK THIS ITEM AS YOU ARE AWARE LAST WEEK PASSED ME THIRTY TO NINETY NINE MEMBERS WENT ON STRIKE. WELL WE DID RECEIVE SUBSTANTIAL NEWS COVERAGE WE'RE VERY FRUSTRATED THAT MEDIA FAILED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO WOMEN. ARE SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERPAID AT THE UNIVERSITY. FOR EXAMPLE IT TAKES AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN SEVEN YEARS TO REACH THE STARTING SALARY OF A WHITE MALE COLLEAGUES. FOR LATINA IT TAKES SIX YEARS TO MEET THE STARTING SALARY OF A WHITE MALE COUNTERPARTS. THIS BEGS THE QUESTION WHY IS THIS HAPPENING. WHITE MEN ARE HIRED INTO HIGHER CLASSIFICATIONS TO BEGIN WITH. WHAT WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO DO IS CRANE CENTER FOR THE UNIVERSITY TO ADDRESS THIS WIDENING GENDER AND RACIAL AND EQUITY? THIS ISSUE WAS FURTHER EXACERBATED BY THE UNIVERSITY'S PRACTICE TO MOVE THE SAME JOBS INTO CONTRACTED PHYSICIANS WHERE EMPLOYEES ARE PAID. EVEN LESS AND ARE NOT PROVIDED STABILITY. A UNIVERSITY EMPLOYMENT. NINETY. THIS SHIP TO THE DISGRACE A WALMART REDOING IT WOULD NOT BE TOLERATED. THE UNIVERSITY HIRES A CONTRACTOR THAT GROWS THIS DISPARITY THERE SHOULD BE CONSEQUENCE WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS LANGUAGE INCLUSION AND LOOK FOR TO GAIN YOUR SUPPORT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. YES MISTER ABOUT. JUST A QUICK QUESTION. YOU'RE SAYING THAT. WHITE MEN ARE HIRED AND AT A HIGHER CLASSIFICATION. COULD YOU DEFINE WHAT THE CLASSIFICATIONS ARE I'M NOT SURE OF THAT STRUCTURE. SO FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT TRADITIONALLY IF THERE'S DIFFERENT. THERE'S A SCALE WHERE YOU CAN EAT I'M HIRED AT SO THE USUALLY GO UP TO ABOUT A NINE. SO. WITHOUT RAISING ANY CONCERN YOU COULD ENTER AT AT STEP ONE UP THERE WITH STEP FOR. BEYOND THAT IT REQUIRES PROPER JUSTIFICATION FOR WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE STARTING SALARY OF WHITE MEN STARTS AT A HIGHER LEVEL WITHIN THAT CATHOLIC KITCHEN WHEREAS MINORITY WOMEN ARE STARTING AT STEP ONE. MIGHT FOLLOW UP QUESTIONNAIRE IS IS THAT FOR THE SAME JOB SAME GOT OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH WILL CONSIDER THAT'S WHEN WE ARE. COME UP WITH OUR FINAL PLAN NEXT WEEK. ALRIGHT WE'RE GONNA PROCEED NOTION NUMBER SIX. CSU DAN HAD OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ALSO WITH A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSALS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REPOSE AT THIS YEAR'S YOU RECEIVE A BASE INCREASE OF NINETY TWO POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS. AN ONGOING GENERAL FUND SUPPORT. WHICH IS THE SAME INCREASE PROPOSED FOR THE SEA IS THAT THE UC. THIS APPROACH INCREASES A FOR THE UC FOR THE CSU IS CONSISTENT PAST PRACTICE. THIS WILL PROVIDE THE CSU AT JUST OVER THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE GENERAL FUND FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THE MAYOR VISION INCLUDES A FEW NEW PROPOSALS FOR THE CSU. FIRST THE MAYOR VISION INCLUDES BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD AUTHORIZE THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE. OFFSET THE SEATS USE MAIN ITEM BY THE AMOUNT OF ESTIMATE THE CAL GRANT CAL GRANT PROGRAM IN MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM COSTS. BECAUSE BY SYSTEM MY TUITION INCREASE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THIS IS THE CORRESPONDING TO PROPOSAL TO WHAT WAS MENTIONED IN THE UC DISCUSSION. CHRIS LANGUAGE SIMPLY REFLECTS THE COST INCURRED BY THE STATE. BY THE STATE'S FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS THAT ARE OFTEN NOT CONSIDERED WHEN TUITION RISES. THE MAYOR VISION ALSO INCREASES THE AUGMENTATION THE CAPITAL FLOWS PROGRAM. A PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS GENERAL FUND TO REFLECT A CHANGE IN THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FROM TWO POINT FIVE ONE. A TWO POINT SEVEN ONE PERCENT. FINALLY THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO INCLUDE ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ONE TIME FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS ACROSS THE SYSTEM. THIS FUNDING WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE CONTROL SECTION SUMMER TO HELP AFTER DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WAS FUNDED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. AND WITH THAT IF YOU HAVE AN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE FOR ME. LEO A AGAIN ARE. IF YOU GOT OUR TABLE ON PAGE TWENTY SIX THAT LISTS ALL THE MAY REVISION PROPOSALS FOR. SEE IF YOU IN THAT'S THAT'S OUR LA OR REPORT THAT I'M REFERENCING THEIR. I'LL JUST TOUCH ON THE FIRST TWO ISSUES OPPOSITE OF TIME AND THERE. OF VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL TO YOU SEE. SO OUR OUR MESSAGES STILL STAND THERE ON THE REAP REPERCUSSIONS FOR THE TUITION INCREASE THE ONLY THING WE WOULD KNOW AS EXISTING LAW ALREADY. CONSTRAINTS USE YOU ABILITY TO USE USE ABILITY TO INCREASE TUITION IN NINETEEN NINETEEN. SUCH THAT WE'RE NOT SURE THAT THAT LANGUAGE IS IT'S QUITE IS NEEDED FOR A AND THE CASES USE YOU AS IT IS FOR YOU SEE. ON THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROPOSAL. A WE RECOMMEND YOU ADOPT THE FUNDING LEVEL AND SEE IF SHE WAS IS A BIT FARTHER ALONG THAN YOU SEE UNDERSTANDING ITS MAINTENANCE NEEDS OF KNOWS THAT AS A TWO POINT SEVEN MEG BILLION DOLLAR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG. ALSO KNOWS IT NEEDS TO SPEND ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION ANNUALLY TO PREVENT THAT BACKLOG FROM GOING FURTHER THERE'LL FURTHER ALONG. OF WE DO RECOMMEND IN ADDITION TO ADOPTING THE FUNDING IF YOU FIRST RECOMMEND THIS MANY TIMES THAT YOU ATTACH A LITTLE REPORT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT FUNDING THAT THEY. COME BACK TO WITH A BROADER PLAN TO. OF PICKED ON THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG OVERTIME AND IDENTIFY WHAT IT WASTE IMPROVE MAINTENANCE PRACTICE OF SUCH THAT. OF THE BACKLOG DOESN'T REEMERGE OR THERE'S THERE ISN'T ANY BACKLOG. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. A RHINESTONE MISSY ISSUE I'D LIKE TO POINT. TALK ABOUT THE MOST OBVIOUS THING OF THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME FUNDS GRATEFUL TO THE ADMINISTRATION. FOR PROVIDING THOSE FUNDS AND IT'S A GOOD STEP FORWARD IN HELPING ADDRESS OUR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ONE THING THAT MY COLLEAGUES FROM FINANCING ELIO I DO NOT REYES WAS THE ISSUE OF ON GOING SUPPORT FOR THE UNIVERSITY. AS SOON AS. MY COLLEAGUE. DAN HAD OUR FROM FINANCE MENTIONED THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED NINETY TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. MAY REVISION HAD NO RECURRING CHANGE TO THAT. AND SO WE STILL ARE LEFT WITH A ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL. IN OUR BUDGET REQUEST TO YOU. AND THAT I SHORTFALL. IF IT'S FILLED WOULD WOULD HELP METER MANDATORY HEALTH CARE COST INCREASES IN A MODEST LEVEL OF ENROLLMENT GROWTH AND BROUGH OF OTHER THINGS INCLUDING INVESTING A GREAT INITIATIVE. A SO WITH THE TUITION. WITH THE TUITION INCREASE OFF THE TABLE AS AS DECIDED ABOUT. A MIDDLE OF APRIL. IT ADDITIONAL ONGOING FUNDING FROM THE STATE IS EVEN MORE CRITICAL. A AND WITHOUT SUFFICIENT FUNDING FROM THE STATE UNIVERSAL NEED TO MAKE A DIFFICULT DECISIONS THAT WOULD SLOW THE. UNIVERSITY WIDE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE INSTANT SUCCESS AND ACHIEVEMENT. SO ARE PRIORITIZING ADEQUATE FUNDING OF FOR THIS ISSUE WE BELIEVE IS KEY TO CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE THANKS FOR THE COMP PREVENT OPPORTUNITY SPEAK. THANK YOU. VOEPEL. NO. I THINK IT SAYS. A VERY BRIEF PROPOSAL HENCE THAT'S WHY MISTER MEDINA'S. ONE FLOOR BELOW US AND WATCHING HIM ON FACEBOOK LIFE USE THEM. PRESS EVENT TALKING ABOUT THE CSU BUDGET SO WE WILL ON. HAVE A HAVE. RESPONSE TO THIS NEXT WEEK NO QUESTIONS. ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN. CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY. GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE PROPOSED. WE HAVE ALWAYS. BY ITS GO AHEAD. AGAIN DAN HAD OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE MINISTRATION PROPOSES THIRTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THIS INCLUDES FIVE PROPOSALS IN THE NAY REVISION. THESE PROPOSALS TOTAL ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS WITH ONE MILLION OF THAT IS ONGOING FUNDING. IN LATE FEBRUARY HUNDREDS OF BOOKS IN THE STATE LOTTERIES COLLECTION WERE DAMAGED BY HEAVY RAINS. THEN A REVISION INCLUDE SEVERAL MEASURES TO ADDRESS THIS. THE ADMINISTRATION OPPOSES SPENDING SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO INSTALL FAULT THAT WOULD PROTECT PART OF THE LIBRARY'S COLLECTION. TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO REPAIR DAMAGE BOOKS AND THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PURCHASE EMERGENCY SUPPLIES ALL WHICH IS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. ADDITIONALLY DOT THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES OFTEN AS DID YES HAS AGREED TO A PARENT THE LIBRARIES DAMAGE REFUSING EXISTING FUNDS IN ITS BUDGET. AND FURTHER THE ADMINISTRATION IS INCLUDED ROUGHLY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND FOR ONE TIME DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IN A CONTROLLED SECTION UNDER DID YES. THE MAYOR VISION INCLUDES FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON GOING GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE CALIFORNIA NEWSPAPER PROJECT. THIS PROGRAM LOCATED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE. WORKS TO COLLECT AND PRESERVE HISTORIC NEWSPAPERS FROM EACH COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA. THE MAYOR VISION ALSO INCLUDES THREE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ONGOING GENERAL FUND. TO ACCOUNT FOR BRENT INC A RANK COST CHARGE BY DID YES. FOR USE OF TWO BUILDINGS AND CENTRAL PLANT FACILITY CHARGES. THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS GENERAL FUND OF WHICH EIGHTY THOUSAND IS ONGOING. PROVIDE NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY EQUIPMENT AND SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES FOR THE STATE LIBRARY. THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO AN ANALYSIS BY THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT WHICH IDENTIFIED SEVERAL VULNERABILITIES IN THE STATE LIBRARY'S LIKE HE'S. FINALLY THE MAYOR VISION INCLUDES FUNDING FOR TWO DIGITAL PRESERVATION PROPOSALS. A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ONGOING GENERAL FUND WILL BE USED TO PERFORM QUARTERLY WEB CROSS. STATE GOVERNMENT WEB PAGES TO CREATE A DIGITAL RECORD. AT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS JET ONGOING GENERAL FUND WERE USED TO PURCHASE DIGITAL STORAGE. WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE FOR ME. OKAY GREAT AND YOUR PROPOSALS ARE LISTED ON PAGE FOURTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA WHEN IT'S ON A REPORTS ALL JUST WORK FROM YOUR AGENDA. AS YOU CAN SEE IN YOUR GENDER THEIR FIVE PROPOSALS A TO HIS PROPOSED TO HIS PROPOSALS WE DON'T HAVE CONCERNS WITH ITS ALL JUST TOUCH ON THE THREE THAT WE DO HAVE. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ABOUT A BECAUSE OF THE TIMING WITH BERMAN RECEIVE THESE PROPOSALS REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION WASN'T ABLE TO ANSWER ALL OF OUR QUESTIONS SO. WE DO HAVE A FEW CONCERNS WE JUST WANTED A LIST FOR THE COMMITTEE. THE FIRST UP WOULD BE THE COLLECTION PROTECTION ACTIVITIES A AS THE AS FINANCE NOTED MOST OF THE FUNDING WOULD BE FOR. A NEW VAULT THE REMAINING FUNDING WOULD BE TO REPAIR BOOKS AND I'D I'D DEVELOP AN EMERGENCY SUPPLY KIT ON THAT'S IN RESPONSE TO. LOVE FLOODING YOUR ROOF LEAK THAT HAPPENED BACK IN. MARCH. I WE THINK THE THE ARE WRITTEN PREPARE FOR THE BOOKS IN THE EMERGENCY SUPPLY KIT IS WARRANTED GIVEN THE DAMAGE ON THOSE BOOKS. ON THE VAULT WE WERE LESS CLEAR ON THE NEED FOR THAT GIVEN THAT OF THE ROOF IS LEADERS CURRENTLY BEING A REPAIRED AND THERE MIGHT BE ADDITIONAL. DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING ALSO IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. FOR ADDITIONAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SO WE THOUGHT THE FIRST PARTY SHOULD BE ON A ENSURING THAT THE THE STRUCTURE OF THE FACILITY IS IN GOOD CONDITION ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES FIRST BEFORE AND SELLING OF OCT. WELL THAT WAS OUR CONCERN THERE. ON THE SECRETARY WITH CONCERN THE CALIFORNIA NEWSPAPER PROJECT THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT THE STATE FUNDED. OF SEVERAL YEARS AGO IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS THE FUNDING LEVEL FROM THE STATE SIDE WAS A A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS CAN. I CURRENTLY THE PROGRAM IS A RECEIVING STATE FUNDING AND IT REPORTS THAT IT'S RECEIVING FEDERAL DOLLARS ACCORDING TO THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THE GOAL HERE IS TO SUPPLANT THAT FEDERAL FUNDING. A WITH STATE FUNDING AND THEN TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATION OF THE ARGUMENT IS THAT THE STATE FUNDING IS. JUST MORE STABLE AND LESS VOLATILE THAN THE FEDERAL FUNDING LIMITATION HOUSING PROVIDED US A MORE CLEAR BUDGET INFORMATION TO DETERMINE OF ALL TOLD US FOR A FUNDING SOURCES. AND I ITS ORMAN'S IN COURT WHETHER NOT FEDERAL FUNDS COULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM. SO WE RECOMMEND TO THE EXTENT THAT FEDERAL FUNDS ARE STILL AVAILABLE FOR THE PROGRAM THAT YOU REJECT THIS PROPOSAL. FINALLY ON THE. DIGITAL PRESERVATION ACTIVITIES ON PAGE FIFTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA OTHER TO PROPOSALS HERE ONCE FOR THE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR PRESERVING STATE GOVERNMENT WEBSITES. OH WE JUST HAD ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ON THIS. PROPOSAL IT. WHICH WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE PURPOSE IS TO STE IS TO PRESERVE GOVERNMENT WEBSITES AT A POINT IN TIME. ARE MEANT TO DO THAT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR WE JUST HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ABOUT WHICH AGENCIES. I WENT WHICH POINT IN TIME HOW THEY MAKE THESE DETERMINATIONS WHY IS THIS A PRIORITY VERSUS SAYING PRESERVING. ALL THAT DATA OR THE OTHER CONTENT THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE THOSE WEBSITES WE RECOMMEND YOU ASKED THOSE QUESTIONS AND A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION ON IT. ON THE SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE. PRESERVATION SORTS OF CAPTIONS THE ADMINISTRATION ARE PROVIDED US SOME CONFUSING INFORMATION HERE OF THE ADMINISTRATION NOTED THAT THE STATE LIBRARY CURRENTLY. PAYS A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER TERABYTE FOR. AT ITS CAPACITY A DIGITAL CAPACITY NEEDS AND CURRENTLY HAS FIFTY TERABYTES SORT SPEND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND IT'S ASKING FOR SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR SEVENTY FIVE TERABYTES IN THAT METHOD MAKES SENSE TO US IT SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD BE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WE RECOMMEND YOU GET MORE INFORMATION ON THAT MORE CLARITY FROM THAT. ENOUGH FROM THE ADMINISTRATION FROM THE STATE LIBRARY TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY CAN'T EXPLAIN THAT WE RECOMMEND PROVIDING TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS INSTEAD OF THE FULL SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND. THANK YOU. VERY WELL. KEEPING TRACK OF THE DETAILS EXCELLENT. AND THAT TAKES US. LITTLE STATE LIBRARY. AND SO WE ARE THANKFUL TO THE GOVERNOR TO. S. ONE FORWARD AND WE SUPPORT. THESE WERE. NOW WE'RE ON ISSUE EIGHT. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING SHOW CAST OF THE SERVICE EMPLACEMENT SHOW UNION. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT TODAY. ON THE ANALYSIS DISTINCTLY. DESCRIBES A PROPOSAL AND IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WILL BE VERY BRIEF. THE PROPOSAL SIMPLY TO ELIMINATE A SUNSET OF EXISTING LAW OF IT VERY NARROWLY AND DISCREETLY CRAFTED LAW. THAT'S IN PLACE SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. THE LAW ONLY DEALS WITH WHEN A LIBRARY. PACKED WITH A FOR PROFIT COMPANY. THIS LAW HAS BEEN WORKING VERY WELL SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL PROTECTING TAX DOLLARS. IT ALSO ENSURES THAT THE LIBRARY. SYSTEM AND WORK IS CONNECTED TO COMMUNITY AND NOT A COMPACT COMMODITY. WE BELIEVE THE LIBRARY SERVICE SHOULD NOT BE COVERED BY A PROFIT MARGIN. AND THAT THIS PROPOSAL WILL IN FACT ENSURE THAT. IT THAT ELIMINATING THE SENSIBLE FACT ENSURE THAT OUR FREE LIBRARY SYSTEM IN FACT REMAINS FREE FOR ALL WHO USE IT. ON WE ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THAT BRINGS US TO ISSUE NINE. JEFF WHAT PART FINANCE UP THE MIRAGE CONTAINS TWO PROPOSALS RELATING HE'S HE HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW. THE FIRST IS ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT. THE IDC HASTINGS I EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT THE UC PATH PROJECT ON ITS CAMPUS. AND THE SECOND IS ONE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ONE TIME FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AT THE CAMPUS. ABOUT OPEN ANY QUESTIONS. BUT PAGE SEVENTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA LISTS THE TWO PROPOSALS JUST FOR YOUR BENEFIT O. TIENEN OUR REPORTS ALL THIS WORK FROM YOUR AGENDA. WE HAVE CONCERNS OF BOTH PUZZLES AND I WANT TO WALK THROUGH THEM WITH THE COMMITTEE. ON THE FIRST ISSUE OF THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND. BUT HE'S THINGS IS REPORTING THAT IT IS IN THE PROCESS OF. ALIGNING ITS HUMAN RESOURCES PROCESSES WITH A THE UC PATH SYSTEM THAT WAS DISCUSSED IN A PREVIOUS ITEM. YOU SEE CURRENTLY USES UC'S EXISTING LEGACY SYSTEM USES IT BURT AND HEADING TO RETIRE THE LEGACY SYSTEM AROUND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. AND BECAUSE OF THAT HE SINGS HOUSE TO WORK TO IMPROVE IT TO. ALIGN ITS CURRENT PROCESSES WITH THE NEW SYSTEM. A HASTINGS OF AND IT ARGUES THAT BECAUSE IT'S SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER UC CAMPUSES IT HAS A LOT MORE WORK TO DO THAN THE OTHER A UC CAMPUSES SUCH THAT. ON ME REQUIRES SORT OF ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD THAT MAYBE A TYPICAL CAMPUS MIGHT. AND. AS A RESULT THEY'RE ASKING FOR AN AUGMENTATION TO WORK TO THAT. YEAH ALIGNMENT MOST ABOUT FUNDING WOULD BE FOR OF CONSULTANTS OBSERVE MANAGE THAT AND AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL FUNDING LARGELY FOR ADDITIONAL TIME TO TO WORK TOWARDS THAT. WE TO OUR CONCERN HERE IS THAT YOU'RE RECEIVING THIS TO A CLOSE THE BUDGET CLOSE OUT EASY PATH WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS INITIALLY. DISCUSSED IN TWENTY ELEVEN BY THE UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN PLANNING THIS FOR SEVERAL YEARS WE QUESTION WHY THE LAW SCHOOL DIDN'T PLAN FOR THE SOONER. AND MORE GRADUALLY AND WHITES COMING TO THE STATE NOW OF SOAP. SO CLOSE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF YOU SEE PATH WILL ALSO QUESTION WHY DIDN'T COME TO THE LEGISLATURE IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS WAS SUCH AS TO NOTABLE CHALLENGE AND WHITES COMING SO CLOSE THE BUDGET BECAUSE THAT'S WE RECOMMEND YOU YOU GET CLARITY ON THOSE TWO ISSUES. AND I THINK THAT THEY'RE NOT SATISFIED BY CLARITY REJECT THIS PROPOSAL. ON THE SECOND ISSUE FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OUR CONCERN HERE IS THAT THE LAW SCHOOL HASN'T YET SUBMITTED A LIST OF PROJECTS THAT WOULD LIKE TO. USE THE FUNDING FOR. AND WE THINK OF THE LIST IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR HASTINGS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT WHERE THERE IS A CURRENT SIZE OF ITS BACKLOGS IS UNKNOWN. ON UNLIKE UC AND CSU HASTINGS IS A RELATIVELY SMALLER US SCHOOL HAS TO FACILITIES BASICALLY OR ONE OF THE FACILITIES IS SCHEDULED TO BE REPLACED BY A NEW FACILITY. ARE AROUND TWENTY NINETEEN AND THE SECOND FACILITY ARE RECEIVED SOME ADDITIONAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING IN STE ONE TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. ALSO THE EXTENT OF ITS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG IS NOT WELL KNOWN TO US RECOMMEND YOU GET THAT WAS BEFORE PROVIDING ANY A ONE TIME FUNDING FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE TO LAW SCHOOL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MAY BE ABLE GET SOME CLARITY WITH HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW. YES MY NAME IS DAVID SEWARD AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER I'M ACCOMPANIED BY OUR ACADEMIC DEAN OF MORSE RATNER. IN TERMS OF THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS. THE COLLEGE IS IS A MUCH SMALLER IN SCALE THAN YOU SEE OR CSU. WE WILL BE TO BUT PROVIDE THAT LIST PREFERRED WITH TO. EQUIREMENTS OF SECTION FIX TO THE PUBLIC FINANCE. ON THAT LIST WE HAVE SOME CRITICAL NEEDS OF PRIMARILY RELATED TO. AS THE NEED TO UPGRADE OUR CLOSED CIRCUIT TV SYSTEM FOR OUTSIDE. COVERAGES. THEY NEED TO OF ACHIEVE CHO COMPLIANCE FOR DUCT WORK AN EIGHT TRACK. ALSO. RENOVATING UPGRADE RESTROOMS. I WE HAVE. THIS AUGMENTATION IS SIGNIFICANT FOR HASTINGS. NOT A DROP IN THE BUCKET FOR HASTINGS IT WILL ALLOW US TO. MAKE SIGNIFICANT STRIDES ARE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND ADDRESS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ITEMS HAIR AFTER THIS ALLOCATION WILL BE LOOKING AT. A OUTSTANDING ITEMS SUCH AS. AFTER THIS ALLOCATION NEW CARPETING PAINTING ELEVATOR UPGRADES. WHICH YEARS LOWER PRIORITY THAN THE FIRE LIFE SAFETY AND THE. THAT SECURITY ELEMENTS SO WILL BE PROVIDING THAT LIST WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE IT AND THE DISCUSS IT FURTHER IF THERE'S ANY INTEREST. IN TERMS OF YOU SEE PATH. A THE PROJECTS BEEN GOING HAND FITS TWENTY TEN TWENTY ELEVEN HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY STARTS AND STOPS. WITH THE LEVEL OF SCRUTINY IN INTEREST OF BEING DEDICATED TO PROJECT BY THE THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE. THE. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION HAS BEEN RAMPED UP THIS CAUGHT US OFF CYCLE. WE WHEN WE SUBMITTED THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET TO THE DEPARTMENT FIND AT THOSE IN OCTOBER. TWENTY. EIGHT POINT SEVENTEEN. AND WE DID NOT KNOW THE FULL EXTENT OF OUR COST OBLIGATIONS A BURDENS THAT TIME WE ARE FULLY FUNDED FOR THE ON GOING COST IS THE ONE TIME COSTS REPRESENT THE CHALLENGE IN THIS ARE ASK. I REQUEST.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BEGAN MARRY OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES THE MAYOR VISION MAKES A NUMBER OF CHANGES TO THE. APPROPRIATIONS AND IT HAS HAPPENED TO NAY COMMISSION AND MOST OF THOSE ARE LARGELY CONCENTRATED AROUND. ENROLLMENT IN CASE THAT WITHIN THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM. THE MAYOR VISION ALSO INCLUDES AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE TRAILER BILL PROPOSAL THAT WAS SUBMITTED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WITH REGARD TO ASSOCIATE DEGREES FOR TRANSFER AND THE MAXIMUM CAL GRANT TUITION AWARD AT PRIVATE NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS. THE ADJUSTMENT OF THAT PROPOSAL IS THAT IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE EXPECTATION OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS ADMITTED HAS BEEN LOWERED TO TWO THOUSAND. IN NINETEEN TWENTY THERE STILL AN EXPECTATION OF THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS ACCEPTED HOWEVER IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE IS NOW AN EXPECTATION THAT THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS ARE ACCEPTED AND THAT NOW SERVES AS THE NEW BASS LINE MOVING FORWARD INTO THE OUT YEARS. GROWN BY THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN TRANSFERS THE SECTOR AS A WHOLE. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU LA IF.

PROPOSAL STONE PLACE AND WE STILL HAVE FUNDAMENTAL CONCERNS WITH FACTS AND THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT ADDRESS OUR FUNDAMENTAL CONCERNS AND WE CONTINUE TO KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CAN YOU KNOW DOESN'T DOESN'T HAVE. A DATA ON ADMISSIONS I'D THE NONPROFIT SECTOR FORCED OF STUDENTS WITH AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFERS OF THE LEGISLATURE SELECTS A BASELINE TO DETERMINE WHETHER. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR THE MAY REVISION IS THE APPROPRIATE EXPECTATIONS. ON THE FINAL IF YOU FOR THE A GENERAL FUND LOAN OF FOR OF C. SAX I CASH FLOW.
