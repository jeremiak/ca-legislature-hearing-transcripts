EAST OF THE SECOND PART WHICH WAS RECENTLY AMENDED INTO THE BILL WOULD GRANT A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA METROLINK. AUTHORITY TO PURSUE CMG C. CONTRACTING WITH THAT WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THE LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. OF THE AUTHORS BILL [inaudible] SEEING NONE. SEMI ANXIOUSLY WAITING IN THE BACK TO TESTIFY. IN OPPOSITION TO THE AUTHORS BILL [inaudible] I'M. PLEASE TAKE YOUR NAME AND HE REPRESENTING PLEASE. IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR JUST TO BE CLEAR THAT I WAS TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF METROLINK. IN THE SENSE THAT THAT'S SO THE RECORD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MORE TALK ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY -- AND PAPA START OF COURSE BY A I SINCERELY APOLOGIZING TO THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIRMAN ARTS HIS MAN [inaudible] TEN ON THE FLIP SIDE -- OF OUR LATE OPPOSITION BUT WE'D REALLY JUST BECAME AWARE OF THIS -- BELL WAS IT WAS A GOTTEN A MAN. TIME ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK YESTERDAY SO -- WE WE HAVE BEEN STARTING WE DO HAVE SOME VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS -- BUT I I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT SEEMED YOU SEE WE SEE THEMES YOU SEE AS A AS A VERY EFFECTIVE TOOL -- IT'S BEEN USED GIANT THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO BRING PROJECTS -- TO COMPLETION QUICKLY AND AND ON TIME AND AND ON BUDGET -- THERE IS SOMETHING HOWEVER UNIQUE TO THIS PARTICULAR AUTHORITY METROLINK IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT SUCH A PA A FORM FROM. I MULTIPLE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES ORANGE COUNTY IS THE SECOND LARGEST MEMBER. OF METRO LINK -- AND WHAT'S UNIQUE FOR US IS THAT. WE AN ORANGE COUNTY FOR PROJECTS ON THE METROLINK LINE THAT OPERATED ONE AND CONSTRUCTED WITHIN. THE COUNTY OF ORANGE. WE ACTUALLY PERFORM THAT CONSTRUCTION WORKER STOPS. IT'S HISTORIC IT'S BEEN DONE THIS WAY FOR THE LAST DECADE -- THERE'S KIND OF A WHOLE HOST OF% HISTORY ON WHY THAT'S COME TO PUT COME TO BE ONE OF THE REASONS IS BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY OWN. ALL FORTY TWO MILES OF TRACK -- OF THE METROLINK LINE. AND AND AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE THINK THAT IT MAKES REALLY VERY LITTLE SENSE TO PROVIDE THIS THE MGC AUTHORITY. FROM METRO LINK OUT WITHIN ORANGE COUNTY'S BORDERS WE THINK THERE COULD BE GREAT VALUE PROVIDED TO IT. SO WE WOULD ASK THE COMMITTEE I AM AND THE AUTHOR TO CONSIDER AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD KIND OF A WRECK PRACTICES -- IS PERFORMED WITHIN THE METROLINK ON ORANGE COUNTY LINES. AND EITHER PROVIDE THAT AUTHORITY TO ORANGE COUNTY -- CTA FOR TO SEE MGC OR JUST PROVIDE THE AUTHORITY TO THE TO THE TO THE OTHER MEMBER AGENCIES. OTHER OPERATE OUTSIDE OF ORANGE COUNTY AND AND SO SO THAT LINKS UP WITH CURRENT PRACTICE SO WITHOUT AGAIN MY APOLOGIES FOR THAT FOR NOT HAVING A LETTER AND AND KIND OF DOING THIS ON THE FLY BUT THOSE ARE CONCERNS IN THEIR VERY REAL BECAUSE OF THE THE CURRENT -- WAY THAT FIVE THE JPA IT'S STRUCTURED. THANK YOU FOR THAT TERM. ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC LIKE TO TESTIFYING OPPOSITION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CLAIRE. ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR MISTER DALY LITTLE PUNCHY AFTER FLOOR SESSION -- WHERE THEY WORD WAS OCS IN THE LOOP ON THE CHANGED ON THE RECENT CHANGES TO THE BILL? SOMEONE AROUND TOLD BY METROLINK STAFF THAT. THE BOARD MEMBERS WERE MADE AWARE -- AYE I WOULD POINT OUT THAT -- UNDER THIS BILL IT JUST AUTHORIZES THE JP TO PURSUE THIS IT DOESN'T SAY WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO USE THE AUTHORITY AND SINCE METROLINK IS A A HAS OSHITA A AS ONE OF ITS VOTING BOARD MEMBERS. IT COULD AS OF VOTING BOARD MEMBER HAVE INFLUENCE ON THE DECISION ON EXACTLY WHERE IN THE TERRITORY OF THIS CONTRACTING METHOD IS UTILIZED [inaudible] WOULDN'T THAT. BE IN LINE WITH THE AMENDMENT SUGGESTED BY OC TEARS REPRESENTATIVE -- AND WE MIGHT THAT BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE AUTHOR. THE AMENDMENT LANGUAGE I MEAN TO ME THAT I UNDERSTAND IT'S PERMISSIVE AND ALLOWS THE CONVERSATION TO HAPPEN -- I DON'T KNOW IF MAKING EXPLICITLY. PUTTING AN END MAKES THAT CHANGE AND WE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE A BETTER. I'D HAVE TO GET MORE DIRECTION FROM MY BOARD AT THIS POINT YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO CONNOR. PURSUE THIS AUTHORITY GIVEN THE SUBSTANTIAL AWARDTHAT STATE PROVIDED TO METROLINK TO IMPROVE SERVICE AND OPEN A BOTTLE NEXT TO THE FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT WHILE TERRITORY. NOW THAT NATURALLY CA CURRENTLY OPERATES SERVICE AND I DON'T THINK THE BILL MANDATES THIS TO HAPPEN IT JUST ALLOWS IT TO HAPPEN AND IT ALLOWS THE PARTNERSHIP. TO DISCUSS WHERE AND WHEN IT HAPPENS IT JUST MAKES IT ELIGIBLE. SO I DON'T THINK IT'S A FATE ACCOMPLI SUCH I'M A LITTLE BIT SURPRISED BY. THE NEED FOR THE AMENDMENT BUT THAT'S WELL I I SEE THE OF AMENDMENT AS AS NOT CUMBERSOME MISSION -- BUT I'M RESPECTFUL OF THE AUTHOR AS WELL. AND IF THE MEMBER IS NOT ACCEPTABLE ABLE RESPECTFULLY LAYOFFS THIS BILL TODAY. GIVEN THAT MY HOME AREA -- BY HAS A PROBLEM. THEN AGAIN I WOULD COMMIT TO ENCOURAGING. TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION -- THIS AFTERNOON AND TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT I MEAN I'M JUST NOT PREPARED TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENT TODAY. BUT I WILL CERTAINLY THAT SEEMS LIKE A FAMILY SQUABBLE THAT SHOULD BE. WORKED OUT SINCE EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME INTERESTS I THE I DON'T SEE THERE BEING A PROBLEM DOWN THE ROAD. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MISTER HARPER. YEAH I I HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS OF COURSE OUT REPRESENTING ORANGE COUNTY IN BEING BOARD MEMBER FOR A CT A ON MYSELF THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE IN TERMS OF ACQUIRING RIGHT OF WAY. I IS A SELF HELP COUNTY I MEAN WE DEFINITELY I TAKE THAT -- RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT ROLE VERY SERIOUSLY. I IF YOU CAN JUST HELP HELP ME UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THIS CAME AROUND. YOU JUST -- YESTERDAY I ENDO CTA HAD TO REACT WITHIN A TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD I GUESS TO BE READY FOR FOR THIS WHAT WHAT IS THE URGENCY OF ADDING THIS INTO THIS BILL THAT THAT'S ONE THING I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND FROM THE AUTHORS. WHY DID THIS COME DOWN AND WHY ISN'T THERE TIME THAT THAT CAN BE PROJECTED OUT NOR HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS RATHER THAN HASTILY ADOPTING THIS TOOK A QUICK? THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF FROM NETFLIX PERSPECTIVE NOW WE RECEIVE THE LARGEST AWARD OF FUNDING IN THE HISTORY OF THE AGENCY. AND ONCE -- WE EMBARK UPON IMPLEMENTING ALL OF THE IMPROVEMENTS ACROSS THE FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILE TERRITORY WE WHERE WE PROVIDE SERVICES CRISSCROSSING THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BASIN -- MASSIVE IMPROVEMENTS WE ARE HOPING TO THE THIRTY AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE SO WE CAN START THE GAME PLAN TO DO THE SYSTEM WIDE IMPROVEMENTS SO THAT. ADD. AT THE END OF THE GOAL WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A FIFTEEN MINUTE HEADWAYS. AND OF THE CORE PART OF OUR SERVICE AREA AND THEN THIRTY MINUTE HEADWAYS IN THE EXTREMITIES. AND IT'S A BIG UNDERTAKING WE'VE AWARDED A MERE BILLION DOLLARS IT'S A VERY BIG PROJECT -- METROLINK IS USUALLY WORKING WITH THEIR MEMBER AGENCIES TO HAVE THEM TAKE THE LEAD ON CONTRACTING THIS IS AN INSTANCE WHERE WE'RE SEEKING TO BE THE LEAD GIVEN THAT SYSTEM WIDE. NOW THE LEVEL IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE'RE PURSUING IT SO WE CAN START EARLY ENOUGH FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AND WE BELIEVE THIS CONTRACTING APPROACH ALLOWS US. TO BRING IN A CONSTRUCTION FIRM. DURING THE DESIGN PHASE TO ACTUALLY GAMEPLAN. WHAT'S GOING TO BE A OF A VERY COMPLEX PROJECT DELIVERY TIMELINE WITH MULTIPLE MOVING PARTS. AND THAT'S WHY IF WE GET THE CLARITY AND LAW THAT WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO PURSUE THIS. A PROCUREMENT APPROACH WE CAN ACTUALLY PLAY OUT THE TIME LINE IN THE GAME PLAN FOR ALL THE SEGMENTS OF OUR REGION TO MAKE THESE IMPROVEMENTS WHAT WERE ESSENTIALLY DOING IS OPENING UP. BOTTLENECKS. IN RAIL SERVICE SO THAT. A DRIVERS WHO HAVE THE ALTERNATIVE ON THOSE LONG COMMUTES WHERE THAT WHEREVER THE COMING FROM YOU KNOW VENTURA RIVERSIDE. HOWEVER THEIR DESTINATION THEY CAN ACTUALLY. RELY ON THE RAIL SERVICE. THAT'S COMING ON FIFTEEN MINUTE OR A THIRTY MINUTE HEADWAYS AND IT'S A REAL ALTERNATIVE TO DRIVING IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BASIN. BUT THOUGH THE CORE PART OF THE RISK THERE ARE APPROACH IN OUR DESIRE TO GET ISN'T ALREADY NOW IS BECAUSE OF THE LEAD TIME THAT IT TAKES. TO A PLAN AND EXECUTE THIS KIND OF A SYSTEM WIDE IMPROVEMENT. WITH A VERY LARGE ARE REAL AGENCY SO TO YOUR YOUR ANSWER HELPS ME UNDERSTAND THE REASON FAR PROVING IT DURING THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION. AYE BUT WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHY THE LANGUAGE WAS INTRODUCED JUST ABOUT A COUPLE DAYS OUTSIDE A WEEK OF THE LEGISLATIVE -- CLOSED ARE DEADLINE SO WE GOT THE AWARD -- FROM CAO STA IN APRIL -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING TO DEVELOP A GAME PLAN WE ACTUALLY HIRED. AN ENGINEERING STAFF FOLKS WITH PUBLIC WORKS EXPERTISE AT THE BILL THE BRAIN TRUST WITH AT METROLINK TO COME A DEVELOPER GAME PLAN. AND THEN WE GOT THE RECOMMENDATION FROM STAFF TO PURSUE CNPC AUTHORITY AS SOMETHING THAT COULD BRING HIM BACK TEAM BASED APPROACH A COLLABORATION ON THE FRONT. AFFORD DESIGNS COMPLETED -- WHAT WE GOT THAT ALREADY WERE AWARE THAT THE RECOMMENDATION WAS MADE WE'RE KIND FROM RECESS AND HERE WE ARE? FEW WEEKS BACK FROM SUMMER RECESS THERE'S ONLY FOUR WEEKS AGO. SESSION AND AND IT WAS IMPORTANT OF A FOREIGN US TO TRY THIS NOW SO THAT WE CAN GET AHEAD OF THIS VERY MASSIVE SET OF PUBLIC WORKS IMPROVEMENTS THROUGHOUT OUR SYSTEM. IF I CAN ASK IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE A REACTION TO THAT. THANK YOU -- TO THE CHAIR -- WE IT THAT'S ACTUALLY UNPRECEDENTED TO PROVIDES TMCC AUTHORITY BEFORE -- ANY ENVIRONMENTAL BY DOCUMENTS HAVE HAVE EVEN BEGUN ON THESE PROJECTS TO THE EXTENT THAT WE KNOW ABOUT ANY OF THE PROJECT AND TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK NOT. TO TALK ABOUT A FAMILY SQUABBLE BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE. IS THAT WE MEMBER OF THE MEMBER AGENCIES ARE NOT FULLY AWARE OF THE FOR THE FULL COMPLEXITY OF IT IS A IT IS AN AGGRESSIVE PROJECT WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT IT BUT WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT. AND IT IS OUR BOARDS THAT WILL BE [inaudible] STOVER RUNS. ANY OTHER KINDS OF CHALLENGES AND PROBLEMS WITH THE PROJECT. AND SO -- BECAUSE THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS EVEN BUT DON ON THESE PROJECTS WE THINK IT IS PREMATURE TO OUGHT TO BE PROVIDING -- THE AUTHORITY -- IN A BLANKET WAY AND LETS YOU KNOW WHAT WE THINK IT WOULD MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE TO BE FIGURING OUT WHERE THESE PROJECTS ARE WHO HAS OWNERSHIP. AND AND AND HOW TO MAKE CMG STATE CMG SEE REALLY WORK PROPERLY THERE'S NO RUSH RIGHT NOW TO DO IT. THE PROJECT THAT WE'RE AWARE OF HAVEN'T EVEN BEGUN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THOSE CONCERNS ON I WOULD BE IN OPPOSITION BE VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE OF CT A POSITION AT THIS POINT. THAT IS YOUR A BILLION IS SO. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SCRIPT THIS IS BAKER. THANK YOU AND I AM I'M JUST NOTICING TWO MEMBERS FROM AN AREA GREATLY AFFECTED BY THE BILL. BOTH PARTIES AND AND WONDERING IF I IF I A JEW DEL BRIEFLY IF IF THERE IS AN AGREEMENT TAKING AMENDMENTS BEFORE WE MIGHT SEE THIS AGAIN OF IS THAT I WOULD I JUST WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY. OUT OF RESPECT FOR TO COLLEAGUES. CHALLENGES THE DEADLINE I'M. PERFECTLY OPEN TO PURSUING A CONVERSATION I LEAVE IT IS A FAMILY SQUABBLE THAT CAN BE WORKED OUT. I JUST DON'T KNOW. TECHNICALLY IF WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT -- AND I HATE TO HAVE THE DEFERRED RELATED PIECE OF THE STALLED. BECAUSE I THINK THAT SAVES LIVES -- AND OBVIOUSLY WE DIDN'T ANTICIPATE THAT THIS FAMILY SQUABBLE WOULD. HOW MEANT TO HAPPEN MINUTE YOU VERY DIFFERENT COMPLETELY ANALYZE IT FIRST VISIONS OF THE BELLS SOMETIMES IT YEAH THANKSGIVING AT LOCAL YOU DON'T KNOW OVER THE TRUMPS THAT -- THINK THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE HERE I HAVE FAITH THAT THE WORK IT OUT SINCE THEY SIT ON EACH OTHER'S BOARDS AND HAVE CROSS POLLINATION ENOUGH. I'M A LITTLE BIT. STRETCH THAT IT OKAY WASN'T AS NEATLY TIED UP. AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. BUT I JUST YOU KNOW I'M BEING HONEST WITH YOU I DON'T KNOW PROCEDURALLY WHAT WE CAN DO AT THIS POINT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THE VEIL. AND YOU KNOW I THINK THE FAMILY WILL BE ABLE TO WORK IT OUT. WELL I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU AT AN HONEST YES. THANK YOU AND I I SUPPOSE I WOULD THROUGHOUT THEIR IF IT'S IF IT'S STILL BEING WORKED ON THERE ARE OTHER THERE'S NOTHING. TO ON THE DIFFERENT EARLIER PART WHICH IS A CONCERN THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS TO POINTS. THERE'S NOTHING TO STOP THEM FROM GETTING ONE NOW WHILE THE FAMILY SQUABBLE WORKS OUT IS THAT RIGHT LIKE THERE'S NOTHING THAT'S SAYING YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE THIS. THAT THEY CAN'T GO FORWARD AND DO IT. KNOWING THAT THERE'S STILL SOME WORK GOING ON THERE ISN'T A BARRIER THAT YOU'RE REMOVING IN THE BILL. TO THAT IS THAT CORRECT. FOR POLITICAL CORRECT WERE [inaudible] IN ESSENCE [inaudible] MANDATING. ARE BLAKE I MEAN WERE THERE NOT RIGHT NOW THEY'RE NOT PREVENTED FROM HAVING THEM IN A WHILE THIS WORKS OUT ON AND AGENCIES. GOD I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THE ANY OTHER PROVISION IS. IN MY EXPERIENCE IN WORKING AND SCHOOL SAFETY COMMITTEES INSIGHT COUNCIL OTHERWISE WHEN WE COULDN'T AFFORD IF THE COST OF A DIFFERENT BILL LATER WAS PROHIBITED. YOU CAN GET A ONE TIME USE. YOU CAN GET A ONE TIME USE DEFIBRILLATOR THAT'S DRAMATICALLY LESS EXPENSIVE THAT MIGHT EVEN BE A PATCH DOES THIS. BUT I THINK IT'S I I KNOW I UNDERSTAND SOME WILLING TO WAIT YEAH. IF YOU CAN ACTUALLY. HOLD ON JUST A SECOND YEAH -- AS FOR OPOSSUM IT IS. IN MY EXPERIENCE THAT NOT ONLY ARE WE THERE'S NOTHING TO KEEP THEM FROM MOVING FORWARD AGAIN THE DEFENDER LATER WHICH IS A REASON. TO KIND OF PUSH FOR THE BELL AND ONE TIME USE DEFIBRILLATORS. ARE MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE SHOULD THERE NEED TO BE AN EMERGENCY KIND OF PATCH LIKE LET'S TRY TO DO THIS I EXPERIENCE THAT IN SCHOOL DISTRICT SYSTEMS. IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE BILL THAT [inaudible] IT. I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT WOULD COUNT IN THE MEANTIME THAT THESE CAN THERE'S NOTHING THE BILL THAT KEEPS IT FROM BEING A ONE TIME USED TO FAVOR LATER. THAT WHEN YOU'RE PUTTING THIS REQUIREMENT IN THERE YOU'RE NOT. PROHIBITING THAT IT CAN BE A ONE TIME USE AND THESE GUYS CAN GO FORWARD AND START WORKING ON THE OTHER FAMILY SQUABBLE. I BELIEVE THAT'S OKAY. I'M I JUST WANNA LAY OFF OUT OF SURELY RESPECT YOU AND AND TRIED TO ADDRESS IMPORTANT ISSUE. AND SEVEN I WOULD OTHERWISE SUPPORT BUT MEMBERS IN THIS BODY IN THIS COMMITTEE HARM. BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE WHO WERE IN THE JURISDICTION MOST AFFECTED BY IT KNOWING THAT THERE'S NOTHING TO STOP DEFIBRILLATORS FROM GETTING ON THESE TRAINS RIGHT NOW ESPECIALLY IF YOU GET A ONE TIME USE THAT'S A LOT LESS EXPENSIVE. US SO THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT. TALKING TO BOTH SIDES THEY BOTH SAID THAT THEY BELIEVE IF THEY COULD WORK OUT THE FAMILY SQUABBLE BY FRIDAY. BY NEXT FIRE DEADLINE I MEAN. I'M OPERATING ON GOOD FAITH WITH THEM -- SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR CAN YOU WORK IT THIS OUT BY NEXT WEEK -- MEAN YOU GUYS THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE VOTES AREN'T HERE SO IT JUST SEEMS TO ME LIKE YOU GUYS SHOULD WORK IT OUT. IT'S SUPPORT RECOMMENDATION EVEN IN LIGHT OF THE LATE. OPPOSITION WHICH WAS I THINK UNFAIR AT THIS POINT -- BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT WE CAN HOLD IT OVER [inaudible] AND WE WILL WE WILL GO AHEAD MY VIEW. SO I WILL TELL YOU WHAT THAT FOLLOW THE CHAIRS [inaudible] IN ADDITION. WE CAN HOLD THAT OVER AND YOU CAN COME INTO NEXT WEEK. GIVE A CHANCE. YOU HAVE YOU MAKE THE CALL.
