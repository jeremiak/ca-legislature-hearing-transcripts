WAITING FOR OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO SHOW UP BUT THE SHOW GOES ON SO OF COURSE ISN'T ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER. TWO ON EDUCATION FINANCE TODAY WERE DISCUSSING THE CSU BUDGETS THAT WE ALL KNOW OF THE GREAT VALUE THE CSU. SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA I FORGOT MY LITTLE CSU BUTTON BUT SEMI DESK MAYBE SOME COULD BRING ERICA SHOCK MY CSU PRIDE. WE NOW SEE THAT CSU SYSTEM. IS THE LARGEST -- PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM IN OUR NATION ONE INTO IN PLACE IN CALIFORNIA THE CSU GRADUATE AND EQUALLY IMPRESSIVE OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS GET THEIR DEGREE EACH YEAR BACHELOR'S DEGREE EACH YEAR -- FROM THE CSU. WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT RE INVESTMENTS AND IN HIGHER AT THE LAST FIVE YEARS BUT CAN YOU LOOK AT WHERE WE WERE OUT IN THE CUTS IN THE GREAT RISK RECESSION. FOR JUST KIND OF GETTING BACK TO TO WHERE WE WE SHOULD WE SHOULD BE AND AND FRANKLY A LITTLE BIT BELOW. WE'RE STILL NOT DOING ENOUGH AS FAR AS SERVING ALL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS EVERY YEAR THIRTY THOUSAND QUALIFIED. A CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL GRADS APPLY TO THE CSU QUALIFIED STUDENTS AND THE DENIED ACCESS ONE ISSUE WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING ON GRADUATION RATES STILL AREN'T GOOD ENOUGH SUPER PROUD THE EFFORT THAT SOME SEE ISSUES ARE DOING INCLUDING RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD HERE AT SAKS STATE AND WE'RE CONTINUING. TO WORK ON THOSE ISSUES AND AND INVESTING IN OUR IN OUR GRADUATION INITIATIVE WORK AND THAT CERTAINLY HELPS STUDENTS GRADUATE -- IN FASTER CLIP WILL LET WITH THE LAST -- DEBT LOAD BUT ALSO FREES UP SPACE FOR MORE CALIFORNIANS TO ENTER -- THE CSU OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE OVER THE HEARING A FEW WEEKS AGO FOR YOU SEE CSU INCOMMUNICADO IS. IS A GOOD STARTING POINTS PROBABLY THE BEST JANUARY BUDGET. THERE WAS SEEN -- THEY BE EVER NORMALLY HAVE THE INCREASES IN THE MAY REVISED -- YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT CERTAIN AS FAR AS HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY WE'RE GONNA HAVE. WHEN THE MAY REVISION COMES OUT AS FAR AS REVENUES IN GENERAL FUND BUT CERTAINLY ONE THING THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO TO FOCUS ON OUR TOP PRIORITY? IS -- ENROLLMENT GROW AND MAKE SURE WE EXPAND ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS I KNOW THAT SEE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO GROW BY -- EIGHTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS NEXT YEAR AND THE JANUARY BUDGET ONLY HAS -- RESOURCES TO GROW BY SEVEN THOUSAND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE TOP ISSUES AGAIN WILL BE LOOKING AT LOOK FOR TODAY'S HEARING. AND AND TALKING ABOUT HOW THE CSU AND THE LEGISLATURE CAN FOCUS ON OUR ON OUR JOINT PRIORITY SO WITH THAT LET'S BEGIN. WITH BRING UP THE CSU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE LA OUT. THE FIRST ISSUE WILL HERE RELATED. TO THE BUDGET AND ENROLLMENT. OKAY BERMAN FINANCE PLEASE BEGIN. REBECCA KIRK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES SIXTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING GENERAL FUND FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH OF 2% AT THE CSU. WHICH EQUATES TO APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY THREE HUNDRED FULL TIME EQUIVALENT RESIDENT STUDENTS. THIS INVESTMENT AS PART OF OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS NEW ON GOING GENERAL FUND PROPOSED FOR THE CSU FOR VARIOUS PRIORITIES AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING THIS FUNDING THE ADMINISTRATION EXPECTS TUITION TO REMAIN FLAT IN. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY WHICH THE CSU HAS INDICATED -- AGREEMENT TO DO. AND WE'VE ALSO INDICATED EXPECTATION THAT ACCESS WILL INCREASE. AND ALSO THAT IT WILL BE THE BEGINNING OF A CONVERSATION OR DISCUSSION WITH THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES ON SHORT AND LONG TERM OBJECTIVES. AND EXPECTATIONS FOR THE SEGMENT. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OKAY THANK YOU LA OF POSTING HOUSE IN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. LEGISLATURE WE HAD SEVERAL FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHEN DECIDING ON A LEVEL OF ENROLLMENT GROWTH FUNDING TO PROVIDE CSU. VERSUS DEMOGRAPHICS -- THE NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES IN THE STATE IS PROJECTED TO DECLINE SLIGHTLY. THIS YEAR WHICH MEANS ALL OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL THE I. ENROLLMENT DEMAND FOR FRESHMAN SLOTS IN THE BUDGET YEAR WOULD DECREASE ACCORDINGLY. AS THE AGENDA NOTES THOUGH CSU IS BEEN DRYING FROM BEYOND THE STATE'S LONGSTANDING FRESHMAN ELIGIBILITY POLICY WHICH IS LIMITED FRESHMAN ADMISSION TO THE TOP ONE THIRD OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE LEARNED THAT SEE IF YOU HAVE BEEN DRYING FOR FROM JUST OVER AND UPDATED INFORMATION FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SUGGEST THAT CSU IS DRAWING FROM AN EVEN LARGER POOL TODAY. LIKELY DUE IN PART TO DRY BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL ENROLLMENT POOL. IN FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN ABOUT NINETEEN THOUSAND FRESHMAN APPLICANTS PLUS ANOTHER TWELVE THOUSAND TRANSFER APPLICANTS MET CS USE MINIMUM SYSTEM WIDE REQUIREMENTS BUT THEY WERE NOT ACCEPTED AT ANY CAMPUS. TO WHICH THEY APPLIED. SO OF KNOWING THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO PROVIDE ENROLLMENT GROWTH FUNDS TO INCREASE LOTS AND REDUCE THE NUMBER OF THOSE REJECTED APPLICANTS KNOWN AS TONIGHT ELIGIBLES. NOW IF THE LEGISLATURE DID MAKE THIS DECISION -- IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO MAKE THAT CLEAR TO CSU WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE ROLE IN THE GROWTH FUNDING IS A NOT SO SEE IF YOU. CAN FOCUS THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH FUNDING ON PROGRAMS AND CAMPUSES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED A HIGH AMOUNT OF A NET ENROLLMENT DEMAND. FINALLY ON ITS PAGES SIX AND SEVEN OF YOUR AGENDA NOTE AND THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WILL EXPLAIN THIS YEAR CSU IS IMPLEMENTING A NEW REDIRECTION POLICY FOR APPLICANTS WHO ARE DENIED ADMISSION AT ALL THE CAMPUSES -- TO WHICH THEY APPLIED SO GOING FORWARD THE LEGISLATURE WILL RUN AT WORK WITH CSU TO MONITOR HOW MANY OF THESE REDIRECTED APPLICATIONS IN APPLICANTS AND UP AND ROLLING. IN A CAMPUS WITH AVAILABLE CAPACITY AND THEN ALSO LOOK AT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS CREATES ENROLLMENT PRESSURE ON CSU TO TO FIND US TO FUND THESE THE STUDENTS. THANK YOU HAPPEN ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SEE IF YOU. I THANK YOU FOR DEDICATING THIS ENTIRE. BUDGET HEARING TO SEE SHE TODAY APPRECIATE VERY MUCH. AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY A FEW WORDS AT THE GET GO ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY -- BEFORE DELVING INTO -- AT THE RUMINATION OTHER ISSUES ON YOUR AGENDA TODAY. MY NAME IS RYAN STORM ON THE SYSTEM VICE CHANCELLOR FOR BUDGET -- FOR THE OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR. AND MANY OF THE ISSUES. TO BE DISCUSSED TODAY ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT -- TO THE UNIVERSITY AND WE HAVE HAD MANY SUCCESSES IN THESE ISSUE AREAS BECAUSE OF THE FUNDING YOU'VE PROVIDED THE UNIVERSITY SO AND OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE WITH THOSE DOLLARS. FOR EXAMPLE ARE FUNDED ENROLLMENT. OUR OUR FUNDED NEW ENROLLMENT HAS GROWN MORE THAN THIRTY ONE THOUSAND FULL TIME EQUIVALENT CALIFORNIA RESIDENT STUDENTS SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION. AND THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND MORE STUDENTS. IN OUR TOTAL STUDENT ACCOUNT IS NEARLY ONE HALF MILLION STUDENTS. ALSO AS YOU ARE HERE -- WE ARE EXCITED BY OUR SUCCESS INCREASING GRADUATION RATES FOR ALL SEE ISSUE STUDENTS WHILE LIMITING OPPORTUNITY ACHIEVEMENT GAPS -- THROUGH GRADUATION ISSUE OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE -- PROVE METS AND ADDRESS SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES IN THE FACILITIES AND UNDERLYING INFRASTRUCTURE OF OUR TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE OF THE GOVERNOR'S UP BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR THE C. ISSUE. IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT PROPOSAL WILL HELP US KEEP PACE WITH OUR OPERATING COST INCREASES CONTINUE MOMENTUM IN IMPROVING GRADUATION RATES. IT WILL HELP US ACCOMMODATE A GROWING DEMAND FOR ENROLLMENT. IT ALLOWS THE POOR ALMOST TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS INTO THE NEEDS OF SEE ISSUE A FACILITIES. A REAL BRIEFLY I'LL MENTION THAT YOU PROBABLY HAVE ALL SEEN THIS BEFORE BUT I JUST PROVIDE YOU HAND OUT THAT -- YOUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MEMBERSHIP AND STAFF REALLY APPRECIATE WHICH SHOWS THE CSU BUDGET REQUEST -- VERSUS WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROVIDED IN HIS REQUEST OBVIOUSLY THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT FILLING UP OF THAT BUCKET AND AND LIKE I SAID WE ARE STILL VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO TO TO THIS POINT. WE ALSO STAND READY AS A C. ISSUE TO SERVE ADDITIONAL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR'S DECIDE TO FULLY FUND ARE ROAMING GROWTH. AND OUR GRADUATION IT SHOULD HAVE BUDGET REQUESTS. AND WE BELIEVE OUR GOOD STEWARDSHIP INSTANT SUCCESSES WARRANT THE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCHFROM MY VANTAGE POINT BUT I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT ENROLLMENT -- TO MY CALL WITH. TO MY COLLEAGUES. GOOD MORNING. I AM DOCTOR EVIL GROWN DIRECTOR ROOMMATE MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR ACADEMIC AND STUDENT AFFAIRS AT THE CSU CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DIRECT ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE TODAY. AS THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ACADEMIC YEAR BEGAN OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS WERE ROCKED AND ROLLED ACROSS THE TWENTY THREE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES. THAT NUMBER REPRESENTS THE FIFTY YEAR OF RECORD STUDENT ENROLLMENT IN THE CSU. AND NEARLY THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND MORE STUDENTS THAN JUST FIVE YEARS AGO. WELL THE CSU HAS BEEN LASER FOCUSED ON IMPROVING DEGREE COMPLETION AND REDUCING TIME TO DEGREE. AS WILL BE DISCUSSED FURTHER IN THE NEXT PANEL WE HAVE ALSO MAINTAINED EMPHASIS ON OUR MISSION OF ACCESS. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT FROM WHICH TO START OUR DISCUSSIONS TODAY. BECAUSE WALL IN ROMAN IS OFTEN CONSIDERED ONLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ADMISSION OF NEW STUDENTS. THE MORE CRITICAL ELEMENT OF ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT IS SERVING CONTINUING STUDENTS. AS FOR THE CSU THEY COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY 70% OF OUR ENROLLMENT. THIS DELICATE BALANCING ACT OF ENROLLMENT IS IMPERATIVE TO MAINTAINING NOT ONLY ACCESS TO THE CSU BUT AUTHENTIC ACCESS. WE'RE ALL STUDENTS BOTH CONTINUING AND NEW HAVE THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND EARN A HIGH QUALITY DEGREE IN A TIMELY MANNER. FOR FALL TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OVER THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS APPLIED FOR ADMISSION TO THE CSU AS A FRESHMAN TRANSFER STUDENT. AND 77% WERE ADMITTED TO THE CSU. ULTIMATELY OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND AND THOSE STUDENTS ENROLLED LAST FALL A RECORD NEW STUDENT ENROLLMENT AND OVER SEVENTEEN THOUSAND MORE STUDENTS FOR THE FALL TERM IN JUST SIX YEARS AGO. I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE TREMENDOUS GROWTH OF THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER PATHWAY WHICH WAS CREATED BY SENATE BILL SB FOURTEEN FORTY IN. TWO THOUSAND TEN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ALMOST TWENTY TWO THOUSAND NEW TRANSFER STUDENTS FROM CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ARRIVED AT THE CSU WITH AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER THAT'S ABOUT ONE THIRD OF OUR ENTERING TRANSFER STUDENT POPULATION. THIS NUMBER IS A 60% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF NEW TRANSFERS WHO AREN'T IN AT T. PRIOR TO TRANSFER COMPARED 220-001-42000. FIFTEEN THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TREND BECAUSE TRANSFER STUDENTS WHO HAVE EARNED IN AT T. AND FOR THE CSU BETTER PREPARED. AND HAVING COMPLETED SPECIFIC COURSE WORK AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THAT SATISFIES AT LEAST HALF OF THEIR CSU DEGREE REQUIREMENTS. AT THE SAME TIME WE SEE THESE TRANSIT IMPROVEMENTS FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS WE ARE EXPERIENCING IMPROVED OUTCOMES FOR THOSE STUDENTS EXITING HIGH SCHOOL WHO SEEK TO ATTEND COLLEGE AFTER GRADUATION. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION REFER. REPORTS THAT ALMOST 50% OF LAST YEAR'S PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES COMPLETED THE SET UP CSU AND YOU SEE COLLEGE PREPARATORY COURSES KNOWN AS A THREE G. COMPARED 234% A DECADE AGO. EACH YEAR WE CONTINUE TO SEE MORE BETTER PREPARES STUDENTS SEEKING HIGH QUALITY AFFORDABLE CSU DEGREE. IN FACT OVER SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND MORE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS APPLIED FOR FALL ADMISSION LAST YEAR THAN IN FALL. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AS A REFERENCE EARLIER PLANNING FOR AND MANAGING ENROLLMENT REQUIRES CLOSE ATTENTION NOT ONLY TO NEW AND FUTURE STUDENTS BUT AS IMPORTANTLY ATTENTION TO THE ENROLLMENT DEMAND AND CAPACITY FOR CONTINUING STIRRED. ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES USE A VARIETY OF STRATEGIES TO MAXIMIZE THE FINITE AND ROAMING CAPACITY THAT EXIST ON A CAMPUS. FOR EXAMPLE CAMPUS AS REGULAR CREATE AND REFINED DEGREE ROAD MAPS. FOR FRESHMEN AND TRANSFER STUDENTS THESE ROAD MAPS ALLOW STUDENTS AND COUNSELORS TO VIEW AND UPDATE A SEMESTER BY SEMESTER PLAN. CAMPUSES SUBSEQUENTLY YOU USE THIS DATA TO PLAN THE CLASS SCHEDULE AND TO PROVIDE THE COURSE IS NEEDED BASED ON STUDENT DEGREE REQUIREMENTS PROVIDING OPTIMAL PASS FOR GRADUATION AND A TOOL. FOR EFFICIENCY EFFICIENTLY MANAGING ENROLLMENT. STUDENT ROAD MAP DATA THE NUMBER OF MAJORS PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS AND PRIOR YEAR ENROLLMENT PATTERNS ARE USED TO CONTINUOUSLY ANALYZE COURSE DEMAND. CAMPUSES PAID PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO HIGH DEMAND COURSES PRIORITIZING CLASSROOM SCHEDULING IN FACULTY ASSIGNMENTS FOR THESE COURSES. WITH SUPPORT FROM THE CSU CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE CAMPUSES ARE PROVIDING TRAINING AND RESOURCES TO FACULTY TO RE DESIGN COURSES TO OPTIMIZE THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY. THIS INCLUDES MOVING COURSES FULLY ONLINE OR TO HIGH BRED FORMATS A MIX OF ONLINE AND IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. IT ALSO INCLUDES THE USE OF VIRTUAL LABS ENGAGING STUDENTS IN EXPERIMENTS AND SIMULATIONS ARE INNOVATIVE ONLINE TECHNOLOGIES. FINALLY CAMPUSES ARE INCREASING ADVISING RESOURCES AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT SUPPORT STUDENTS TO THEIR GRADUATION GOALS AND HELP CAMPUSES MANAGE ENROLLMENT. ALL CAMPUSES USE A COMBINATION OF THE A FOUR MENTIONED STRATEGIES TO MAXIMIZE STUDENT ACCESS TO COURSES AND SUPPORT. REGARDLESS WHETHER OR NOT THE CAMPUS IS IMPACTED. HOWEVER ONCE THE STRATEGIES ARE NO LONGER SUFFICIENT ON THEIR OWN FOR MANAGING ENROLLMENT I CAMPUS MAY REQUEST TO DECLARE IMPACTION TO BETTER CONTROL THE ENROLLMENT OF NEW STUDENTS. SHORTLY THE CSU WILL BEGIN THE REDIRECTION A FIRST TIME FRESHMAN ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER AND UPPER DIVISION TRANSFER APPLICANTS. WHO MEET CSU MINIMUM ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AND WE'RE NOT ADMITTED TO ANY CSU CAMPUS THEY APPLIED FOR FALL? TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN APPLICANTS WILL BE ABLE TO SELECT A FIRST AND SECOND CHOICE CAMPUS TO HAVE THEIR APPLICATION RE DIRECTED. ANY APPLICANT THAT DOES NOT RESPOND WILL ALSO BE REDIRECTED TO A CAMPUS THAT STILL HAS CAPACITY TO ENSURE ALL CSU ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS HAVE A SPOT AT THE CSU IF THEY WANT TO ATTEND. IN CLOSING INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES AND THE CSU SYSTEM ARE CAREFULLY BALANCING AND ROMAN OPPORTUNITIES FOR PART CONTINUING STUDENTS SEEKING TO MAKE TIMELY PROGRESS TOWARDS THEIR DEGREE WITH THE GROWING PERSPECTIVE. STUDENT POPULATION FROM CALIFORNIA'S HIGH SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHICH IS LARGER. BETTER PREPARED AND MORE DIVERSE. CAMPUSES MUST CAREFULLY CONSIDER AND EVALUATE THEIR CAPACITY IN RESOURCES TO PROVIDE AUTHENTIC ACCESS TO CONTINUING AND NEW STUDENTS. WITH OVER FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS 94% OF WHICH ARE FROM CALIFORNIA THE CSU EDUCATES THE MOST ETHNICALLY ECONOMICALLY AN ACADEMICALLY DIVERSE UNIVERSITY STUDENT BODY AND THE NATION. STUDENTS FAMILIES AND SCHOOLS HAVE ALL TAKEN THE RIGHT STEPS TO PREPARE FOR COLLEGE BUT TO MEET THE DEMAND FROM INCREASING NUMBERS OF STUDENTS AND AS IMPORTANTLY ME CALIFORNIA'S NEEDS FOR AN EDUCATED WORKFORCE TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE IN THE US AND GLOBALLY. WE WILL NEED RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN OFFER THEM A PLACE THAT THE CSU. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. OKAY THANK YOU [inaudible] QUESTIONS. OF COUPLE HELLO BUT MISTER DONALD GET READY. FOR THIS QUESTIONS ALL START OUT WITH THE REDIRECTION. ISSUE AYE AYE I THINK THAT'S A GOOD POLICY AND I KNOW WE WE PURSUED. THIS THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. AND I YOU'RE STARTING RIGHT NOW SO IT'S HARD TO TELL HOW IT'S GOING TO PLAY OUT. AND OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SON COVETED CAMPUSES OF THE TWENTY THREE SEE ISSUES WITH WE GET A LOT OF APPLICATIONS FOR THEIR IMPACTED. MY UNDERSTANDING IS SAN DIEGO LONG BEACH NICK THE CAL POLY'S ARE ARE ARE SOME OF THE TOP ONES -- HOW REALISTIC YOU THINK THAT IT WILL BE WHERE PEOPLE WILL WILL -- APPLY TO THESE CAMPUSES AND GET REDIRECTED NOT TO DIMINISH. THE OTHER ONE'S OWN IT DISPARAGE BAKERSFIELD HOW ISLANDS DOMINGUEZ HILLS HUMBLE SAN FRANCISCO STANISLAUS -- BUT WHAT WHAT WHAT DO YOU WHAT WHAT WOULD BE PROJECT -- WHAT WILL HAPPEN HERE? AS THIS PLAYS OUT. IT'S REALLY HARD TO PREDICT ANY TYPE OF NUMBERS AT THIS POINT SINCE THIS IS REALLY THE FIRST YEAR THAT WE WILL BE RE RE DIRECTING FIRST TIME FRESHMEN AND UPPER DIVISION TRANSFERS AS YOU KNOW PREVIOUSLY. WE ONLY REDIRECTED ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS -- ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS HAVE NOT REALLY TAKEN ADVANTAGE EVERY DIRECTION SO WE DO THANK THE NUMBER WILL BE HIGHER. BUT WE CAN'T REALLY PREDICT AT THIS POINT IN TIME [inaudible] OKAY. AND THEN MY QUESTION FOR THE LA -- YOU MENTION THAT THAT THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIANS IN SCHOOL AGE IS GOING DOWN CORRECT WE SEE THAT A K.. TWELVE POPULATION. BUT BUT ISN'T THE THE FLIP SIDE THAT WE HAVE MORE STUDENTS WHO ARE EVEN OTHER FEWER ACTUALLY HIGH SCHOOL. GRADUATES THEY'RE MORE GRADUATES WHO ARE. TAKING THEIR A THREE G. COURSES AND ARE READY FOR COLLEGE HIMSELF DOESN'T THAT KIND OF EQUAL OUT ARE POTENTIALLY -- SHOW THAT THERE'S MORE AND MORE OF A DEMAND FOR YES THAT'S HIGHER AT THAT'S CORRECT. DECADE AGO OR SO IS ABOUT 34% OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES HAD COMPLETED THEIR A THREE JEEZ. AND IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN WE LEARNED LAST YEAR THE NUMBER HAD GONE UP THE PERCENTAGE YOU GOT UP TO ABOUT SKEWS THE 43% OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADS. HAD COMPLETED THREE THREE JEEZ OF THAT. 81% -- HAD. WE BEEN QUALIFIED TO GO TO CSU BECAUSE THEY HAVE A CERTAIN GPA OR SAT SCORES THEY NEEDED. AND BETA WE LOOKED AT FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT EDUCATION WHICH I MENTIONED MY REMARKS INDICATES THAT THAT PERCENTAGE IS GONE UP SO IT'S 41%. IN ONE YEAR 43% ANOTHER 45% AND OTHER YEAR SO THAT'S CORRECT AND LEGISLATURE JUST AS A NO AT THIS POINT IF THAT 45% IS GOING TO KEEP GOING UP FORTY SEVEN FORTY NINE FIFTY ONE IF IT'S PEAK TO IT'S IT'S NOT CLEAR BUT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE IS THAT. YOU'VE HAD A AN INCREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADS THAT ARE COMPLETING THE RATE TO JEEZ IN OUR IN OUR MEETING SEE ISSUES -- ELIGIBLE REQUIREMENTS. AND THEN IF THE STUDENTS -- EXCEPT THE REDIRECTION. DO WE ANTICIPATE IF THEY ALL ACCEPTED WE ANTICIPATE. THERE WOULD HAVE ENOUGH MONEY IN THE BUDGET TO COVER THAT WITH. ENROLLMENT FUNDING WE'RE GIVING YOU OR HAVE TO COME BACK THE NEXT YEAR TO SORT THAT OUT -- FROM A BUDGETARY PERSPECTIVE WE WOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO TO FIND EVERY SINGLE STUDENT. I KEEP IN MIND THOUGH THAT NOT EVERYONE WHO APPLIES TO A C. ISSUE ENDS UP -- WANTING TO GO TO A C. ISSUE RIGHT THERE OTHER THE OTHER COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN THE STATE AND IN THE COUNTRY -- BUT WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO A RIGHT NOW WHAT YOU HAVE IN THE BUDGET SO FAR IS ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS THAT WOULD BE FUNDED UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- SO THERE'S MONEY THERE THAT WE COULD USE TO ABSORB INITIAL ENROLLMENT THE OTHER PIECES THAT THERE SOME ONE TIME FUNDING IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET -- THAT WE HAVE INTENSELY HELD BACK KNOWING FULL WELL THAT THIS RE DIRECTION POLICY WAS GOING -- TO POTENTIALLY LAND STUDENTS AT OTHER CAMPUSES ARE PLAN GOING FORWARD IS TO ALLOCATE THAT FUNDING TO THOSE CAMPUSES IN ORDER TO ADDRESS SOME OF THAT. FUNDING GAP IF WE HAVE -- S. TSUNAMIS SO TO SPEAK OF OF NEW STUDENTS ENROLLING IN THE C. ISSUES SO I THINK WE'RE GONNA BE SOMEWHAT ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT BUT IF IT WERE EVERYBODY WANTING IN. I THINK WE WOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH FUNDING IN ORDER COVERED ALL OKAY. AND BACK TO THE TO THE ISSUE TO TO USE THE ISSUE AS FAR AS SERVING. ALL THE STUDENTS THAT -- ARE APPLYING. AT THE DE THE REQUESTED YOU. HAVE THAT YOU SAY IS A HUNDRED EIGHT MILLION. THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE TO SERVE ALL THE THIRTY THOUSAND THAT ARE. DENIED EVERY YEAR IT'S CLOSER TO TO THAT NO IT'S EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND WRECKED. AND THEN SO THE DIFFERENCE HERE BETWEEN. WHAT IT IN COURT IN YOUR CHART IS THE IS THE ROUGHLY? WHAT FORTY SIX MILLION RIGHT? YEAH THE WHAT THAT THAT THE ONE THING THAT WE DON'T WE HAVEN'T CAPTURED ON THAT WHICH WOULD MAKE IT A BIT MORE CONFUSING IS THAT WE HAVE WE WITH NEW IN ROME THAT COMES ADDITIONAL TUITION REVENUE RIGHT YOU HAVE A MORE STUDENTS SO. THERE IS THAT PIECE OF IT THAT FACTORS AND I GUESS A SIMPLE QUESTION IS THAT IF WE DID WANT TO DO. THE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND WHICH WE DO WORK. THERE IS A NUMBER THAT YOU SAID IT WOULD COST US NINETY MILLION AND THEN THAT'S WHEN YOUR CHART SAYS WOULD ONLY COST US. FORTY SIX MILLION SO WHAT'S THE NUMBER RIGHT IT'S NINETY MILLION DOLLARS WHAT WHAT I'M WHAT I'M NOT DEPICTING ON THAT SLIDE THERE IS THE TUITION REVENUE THAT HELPS BALANCE THE ENTIRE PLAN THERE SO IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT A PERFECT GRAPHIC RIGHT THERE BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT. THE STATE WOULD HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE ABOUT NINETY NINE ALMOST NINETY THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO GET 25% ON TOP OF THAT ON TOP OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED AMOUNT YEAH. AND THEN -- I THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TO TALK ABOUT THAT STUDENT FEES AND WE WANT TO KEEP THEM. AS LOW AS POSSIBLE. BUT THERE IS A DOWNSIDE TO THAT. SO AT AT CSU THE MAJORITY OF YOUR STUDENTS ARE EITHER ON CAL GRANT OR OTHER OTHER PROGRAMS THAT PAY NO TUITION AND WHAT'S THE NUMBER AGAIN THAT PERCENTAGE ROUGHLY. I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING IT'S ABOUT 60% OF OUR STUDENTS SO60% HAVE A SUGG AT THE STATE UNIVERSITY GRANT OR A CAL GRANT OR YEAH MEANS YEAH. YES SO OF COURSE WE WOULD LIKE TO PUT MORE MONEY IN THE BUDGET IN -- IN MAY. HOPING THAT THE TAX RECEIPTS GO UP AND RIGHT NOW THE ALLEY -- SAYING THAT IT'S NOT LOOKING THAT. THAT FAVORABLE -- SO THAT THAT THAT THE DOWNSIDES WE MAKE THAT HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL MONEY TO FOCUS ON FULL TIME FACULTY WHICH ARE GOING TO HEAR -- OTHER PRIORITIES LIKE ENROLLMENTS -- PROJECT REBOUND IDEA OR OTHER ISSUES THAT WE THINK ARE PRIORITIES -- IN THE IN THIS BUDGET SO THAT THE STUDENT FEE ISSUE IS INTERESTING BECAUSE IF YOU INCREASE STUDENT FEES BY 4%. ADDITIONAL -- MONEY AND THEN -- YOU KNOW PEOPLE ON THE UPPER INCOME OF COURSE POTENTIALLY COULD COULD PAY FROM AROUND% SEATED IS THE REALLY THE SQUEEZE ON BY FOLKS IN THE MIDDLE. BUT THE FLIP SIDE IS THAT IS BY NOT. DOING THAT THEN THAT'S ROUGHLY. YOU KNOW FIFTY OR SO MILLION THE YOU DON'T HAVE. TO TO FOCUS ON THE GRADUATION INITIATIVES OR ISN'T THERE ARE ADDITIONAL STUDENT ENROLLMENT SO. YOU KNOW IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT -- WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT THERE'S A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT. SO [inaudible] THANK YOU. MISTER JENNER MISTER O'DONNELL. OKAY SO WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN AND REVISITED AFTER WE HERE WHAT'S IN THE MAY REVISION AS FAR AS REVENUE. ISSUE NUMBER. TWO THE CSU GRADUATION ISSUE. TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT CONTINUED PROGRESS FOR THE CS USE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AS OUTLINED IN THE AGENDA THE CSU IS MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS TOWARD THE GOALS OF THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE WHICH WAS ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND TWENTY SIXTEEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INVESTMENT WILL AID THE CSU AND CONTINUING TO IMPROVE TIME GRADUATION. FOR BOTH FRESHMEN AND TRANSFER STUDENTS AS WELL AS DECREASING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY LA OF HAS YOUR AGENDA NOTES ON PAGE EIGHT CSU CURRENTLY DESIGNATES A HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING. RESOURCES FOR THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. AND THEY GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF BASS FUNNY NON GOING FUNDING FOR THE GRAD INITIATIVE TO TWO HUNDRED FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. CSU CONTINUES TO IMPROVE GRADUATION RATES FOR BOTH FIRST TIME FRESHMEN AND TRANSFER STUDENTS. GAPS IN GRADUATION RATES AMONG CERTAIN RACIAL ETHNIC GROUPS HAVE NARROWED ALBEIT SLIGHTLY YOU CAN SEE THAT THE TABLE ON PAGE. EIGHT IN ADDITION DATA INDICATES THAT STUDENTS ARE GRADUATING WITH FEWER ACCESS UNITS WHICH RESULTS IN LOWER COST TO THEM AND THE STATE. AND ALSO FREES UP COURSE SEATS FOR OTHER STUDENTS. SO OVERALL CSU IS SHOWING IMPROVEMENT AND A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT AREAS PERTAINING TO STUDENT PERFORMANCE AND IF THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE GOING FORWARD. WE RECOMMENDED A LINK FUNDING FOR THE INITIATIVE TO AN EXPECTATION THE CSU CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS ON KEY STUDENT OUTCOMES INCLUDING IMPROVING GRADUATION RATES. NARROWING ACHIEVING GAPS AND REDUCING EXCESS UNITS. AND ONE WAY CSU COULD CREATE A BETTER INCENTIVE FOR STUDENTS TO AVOID EXCESS UNIT ACCUMULATION. AND MAXIMIZE AID FOR OTHER STUDENTS WOULD BE TO MODIFY A POLICY ON CS USE INSTITUTIONAL GRANT AWARD WHICH YEAH WE JUST MENTION IS THE STATE UNIVERSITY GRANT OR SUB. CURRENTLY STUDENTS CAN RECEIVE A STUDENT NUMBER CITY GRANT FOR UP TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEMESTER UNITS WHICH IS A FULL YEAR'S WORTH OF UNITS. BEYOND WHAT IS TYPICALLY REQUIRED FOR A BACHELOR'S DEGREE BY CONTRAST STATE LAW LIMITS CAL GRANTS FOR FOUR YEARS OF FULL TIME IN. ATTENDANCE OR THE EQUIVALENT WHICH IS JUST A HUNDRED AND TWENTY UNITS. ANOTHER WAY FOR CSU TO FURTHER REDUCE TEXAS UNITS WOULD BE TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF TIMES A STUDENT CAN REPEAT. THE SAME COURSE FOR A BETTER GRADE. MOST CAMPUSES ALLOW STUDENTS TO TAKE THE SAME COURSE FOR UP TO THREE TIMES. AND STUDENTS TYPICALLY ALLOWED TO REPEAT UP TO TWENTY EIGHT UNITS OF COURSE WORK IN THIS WAY. SO WE RECOMMENDED NACHMAN OF A SYSTEM WIDE POLICY THAT LIMITS STUDENTS TO TAKING THE SAME COURSE FOR BETTER GRAY TWO TIMES WHICH IS ALREADY THE POLICY ON A NUMBER OF CSU CAMPUSES. ARE GIVEN AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE CURRENTLY DOES NOT COLLECT DATA ON UNITS ACCUMULATED DUE TO COURSE REPETITION THE LEGISLATURE COULD REQUIRE SEE ISSUE TO REPORT THE STATE AS PART OF A ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REPORT THAT THEY SUBMIT IN MARCH. THANK YOU. FOR THANK YOU CSU. GOOD MORNING I'M JAMES MINOR SYSTEM VICE CHANCELLOR AND SENIOR STRATEGIST IN THE C. ISSUE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE -- I WANT TO MAKE A JUST A FEW MENTIONS BY WAY OF UPDATE ON THE GRADUATION ISSUE THANK YOU FOR FOR HAVING US HERE THIS MORNING. AS MOST OF YOU KNOW THIS IS -- QUITE AN AMBITIOUS AGENDA AND INITIATIVE FOR THE C. ISSUE. WHICH ENDEAVORS NOT ONLY TO BE THE LARGEST AND MOST DIVERSE FOR YOUR SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY BUT THE FIRST AND BEST. IN TERMS OF PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY DEGREE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIVERSE STUDENTS -- A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN WE STARTED THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE THE SYSTEM WHY FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE WITH 19% -- NO QUESTION HERE THAT SOME OF OUR CAMPUSES HAS SINGLE DIGIT FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATES. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE REALLY FOCUSED OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. AND JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER AS PAUL MENTIONED -- THE GRADUATION RATES IN VIRTUALLY EVERY CATEGORY. ARE REPRESENTING ALL TIME HIGHS FOR THE C. ISSUE. THE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE HAS GONE FROM 19% 225%. AND A SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATE HAS GONE FROM 57% 261% WHICH IS ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE FOR LIKE INSTITUTIONS FOR FOUR YEAR COMPREHENSIVE -- PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS WHICH IS PRETTY REMARKABLE FOR SYSTEM. AGAIN EACH OF THESE CATEGORIES REPRESENT AN ALL TIME HIGH FOR THE C. ISSUE JUST LAST YEAR'S YOU HEARD APRIL MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS SESSION. THE C. ISSUE AWARDED A HUNDRED AND FIVE BACCALAUREATE DEGREES WHICH IS ALSO A AND AN ALL TIME HIGH BUT BUT LET ME JUST PUT A FINER POINT ON THAT. THIS IS SIX THOUSAND ADDITIONAL DEGREES OVER AND BEYOND WHAT THE C. ISSUE PRODUCED IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR. THIRTEEN THOUSAND MORE BACHELOR'S DEGREES THEN THE CSU PRODUCE JUST TWO YEARS AGO -- THE SECOND THING THAT I WOULD JUST MENTION IS THE FUNDING FOR THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. IN THE AMOUNT OF SEVENTY FIVE MILLION AND REOCCURRING FUNDS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. HAS WERE ALLOW THE C. ISSUE TO DO THINGS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO BY WAY OF HIRE AN ADDITIONAL FACULTY -- ADICIONAL TENURE TRACK FACULTY ADDITIONAL ADVISORS -- INVESTMENTS AND DATA CAPACITY AND DATA INFRASTRUCTURE ON OUR CAMPUSES WHICH HAS MADE A REMARKABLE DIFFERENCE. ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT -- BY WAY OF A SORT OF AGGRESSIVE POLICY CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE MOST OF YOU OF HAVE HAVE -- LEARNED ABOUT THE DRAMATIC DEVELOPMENT -- EDUCATION REFORM THAT TOOK PLACE LAST YEAR. I'M JUST JUST ONE MENTION IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT IS MEANT -- EVERY YEAR THE C. ISSUE PREVIOUSLY AND ROLLED ROUGHLY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED TO A DEVELOPMENTAL EDUCATION COURSE. OUT LAST YEAR THAT POLICY CHANGE. THIS FALL -- THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS -- WHO OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN RELEGATED TO A DEVELOPMENTAL EDUCATION COURSE -- THE NUMBER OF THOSE STUDENTS THAT ARE PASSING A LOWER DIVISION MATH COURSE IN THEIR FIRST TERM IS INCREASED EIGHT FALL -- AGAIN WHICH IS PRETTY REMARKABLE AGAIN WE'RE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT I WANT TO PUT THIS IN CONTEXT -- YOU LOOK AT ANY OTHER STATE -- AND JUST THE SCALE OF THE SEA ISSUE THIS WITHOUT QUESTION HAS BEEN THE LARGEST AND MOST PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENTAL EDUCATION REFORM IN THE COUNTRY -- THE LAST THING I'LL SAY JUST BY WAY OF THE FUNDING OF ONE WE ESTABLISH THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE GOALS WE LOOKED AT PEER INSTITUTIONS WE ASSIGNED. EACH OF OUR TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES A SET OF PEER INSTITUTIONS TO ESTABLISH THE GRADUATION RATE TARGETS. WHAT WE LEARNED IN DOING THAT -- IS THAT ON AVERAGE THE PEER INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WERE SPEND ROUGHLY A THOUSAND MORE DOLLARS PER PUPIL. RIGHT THEN THE SEA ISSUE -- AND IN MOST CASES THE NATIONAL DARLING IN THE IN IN THE COUNTRY IS GEORGIA STATE -- BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA -- WHERE AN IN STATE STUDENTS GOING TO PAY TWICE AS MUCH AS A AS A CALIFORNIAN WOULD PAY? AND WE NOW HAVE A NUMBER C. ISSUE CAMPUSES THAT ARE OUTPERFORMING GEORGIA STATE. AT HALF THE COST OF WHICH IS PRETTY REMARKABLE A SOUL OUR REQUEST FOR THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. AND LARGE PART IS TO SUSTAIN THE MOMENTUM THAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST -- TWO YEARS I THINK -- IT WILL SEND A VERY STRONG SIGNAL -- THAT IF THE STATE. THE SIZE TEN BASS LAST THEN THAT IN THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE OUR OUR INTENT IS TO KEEP OUR FOOT. ON THE GAS IF YOU WILL AND AND THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WILL ALLOW US TO DO THAT. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] QUESTION. I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE THE DIFFERENTIAL IN SOME OF THE CAMPUSES NEEDS OF OF COURSE ON A BRAG ABOUT SEX DATING WE HAD THEIR GRADUATIONS ARE. LAST YEAR AT THIS PANEL. AND IT'S JUST OFF THE CHARTS AS FAR AS WHAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO TO DO HERE AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS IS SIMPLE. EXPECTATIONS FROM THE GET GO. THEY BRING THE STUDENTS AND WHEN THEY FIRST AND ROLAND AND SHOW THEM. HEY IF YOU TAKE TWELVE UNITS A YEAR VERSUS FIFTEEN THIS IS HOW MUCH WILL MEAN AT THE END AS FAR AS HOW MUCH DEBT YOU HAVE AND IN ANOTHER YEAR. OF IN SCHOOL IS A PARS EARNING YOUR CREEK RUNNING EARNING MONEY IN YOUR IN YOUR FUTURE CAREER. SO WHY IS IT SO COMPLICATED WIRED SOME OF THESE CAMPUSES. STEPPING UP LIKE TAXED STATES. TO WHAT YOU KNOW I THINK ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES ARE. EMPLOYING ACTIVITY UNIQUE TO THEIR PARTICULAR CAMPUS AND THE STUDENT POPULATION -- WE HAVE TRIED TO GIVE CAMPUSES SUFFICIENT AUTONOMY AND LEVERAGE TO DO WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS BEST FOR THEIR STUDENTS THEMSELVES TAX STATUS MEMBER MARKETABLE -- BUT I CAN TELL YOU NOW THAT SIMPLY EMPLOYING THOSE STRATEGIES ON DIFFERENT CAMPUSES YOU HAVE. FAIRLY DIFFERENT OUTCOMES SO I THINK YOU SEE A RANGE OF ACTIVITY -- AND I THINK ALL OF OUR CAMPUS IS A SAFE TO SAY ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT OUR CHANCELLOR IS BEEN VERY CLEAR WE WANT TO BE. EXCEPTIONALLY CLEAR ON THE GOAL -- AND GIVE OUR CAMPUS PRESIDENTS THE LATITUDE TO IT -- TOO EMPLOY THAT STRATEGY IS A THINKER BASS FOR THEIR CAMPUSES. ALRIGHT I KNOW THAT -- I KNOW THAT IT'S THE AMOUNT REQUESTED IN THIS PROPOSAL FOR THE CSU TRUSTEES WAS SEVENTY FIVE IN THE GOVERNOR'S. AT JANUARY BUDGET FORTY FIVE CENTER STILL AND ASK THEIR CELL WILL KEEP THIS -- UNDER CONSIDERATION AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT REVENUES FROM THE NEW REVISED. THANK YOU WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN AS WELL. WITH THAT WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER. THREE UPSTART YES THIS PLEASE TAKE THEIR ALL. MCCARTY HERE BRO. MEDINA HERE O'DONNELL. QUORUM IS ESTABLISHED YEAH. OKAY SHE NUMBER THREE COMPENSATION AND OTHER OPERATIONAL COSTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES ONE HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILLION ON GOING GENERAL FUND FOR OPERATIONAL COSTS AT THE CSU. THIS FUNDING WILL SUPPORT CRITICAL OPERATIONAL NEEDS IDENTIFIED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. INCLUDING CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED COMPENSATION NON SALARY COST INCREASES AND OTHER OPERATIONAL COSTS. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY. HELLO SIR THIS CERTAIN. ISSUE REPRESENTS THE SINGLE LARGEST PROPOSED COST INCREASE FOR CSU HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. AS THE AGENDA NOTES ON PAGE FIFTEEN ISSUE COMPRISES SALARY COSTS. WHICH DEPARTMENT FINANCE JUST NOTED AS WELL AS FOR OTHER BASIC COST PRESSURES FACING THE SEGMENT -- THIS RETIREMENT COSTS HEALTHCARE COSTS COSTS OF FOR THE HIKE IN THE STATE'S TO COVER THE HIKE IN THE STATE'S MINIMUM WAGE. AND COSTS FROM OPENING UP NEW FACILITY SPACE IN THE BUDGET YEAR. SO AS FAR AS THE SALARY COSTS. THAT WOULD MAKE UP A HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT THAT MAKES UP A HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT MILLION OF THE PROPOSED HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILLION. AND THAT'S FOR REPRESENTED DOWN ON REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES IN. NINETEEN TWENTY FOR THE MOST PART THESE MONIES WOULD FIND CONTINUING BARGAINING AGREEMENTS THAT THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES RATIFIED IN PRIOR YEARS. AND WITH CONTRACTS GENERALLY BECOMING OPEN AT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY THE LEGISLATURE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY IN THE BUDGET YEAR TO SIGNAL WHAT IT THINKS IS REASONABLE TO FINE TUNE BARGAINING CONTRACTS. LEGISLATURE COULD SIGNAL ITS EXPECTATION THAT CSU SALARY INCREASES BE ALIGNED WITH PROJECTED INFLATION THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO USE THE RESULTS OF THAT. ANY CSU COMMISSION FACULTY AND STAFF COMPENSATION ANALYSIS TO GUIDE LEGISLATURE'S FUNDING DECISIONS. THANK YOU. A RAINSTORM AGAIN WITH C. ISSUE -- WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OBVIOUSLY OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- THE PROPOSAL IN THIS AREA THAT TO COVER COMPENSATION INCREASES FOR NINETEEN TWENTY AS WELL AS THE MANDATE WHAT WE CALL OUR MANDATORY COSTS WHICH COVER HEALTH CARE AND THOSE THINGS MENTION BY MR STING HOUSING. THOSE ARE ALL PERFECTLY ALIGNED WITH OUR BUDGET REQUEST IN THE ANALYSIS THAT WE'VE DONE TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT OUR COMPETITION COSTS WILL BE AS WELL AS A LOT OF THE RETIREMENT COSTS AND OTHER OTHER MENTOR COSTS? SO WE'RE DEFINITELY VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS ENDEAVOR I WILL SAY THAT -- FROM FROM FROM COMPARING THIS ADMINISTRATION TO THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION IS INCREDIBLY ENCOURAGING AND HELPFUL TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES THAT ARE PRESSING AND AND UPON US OF THE SEA ISSUE WHICH IS. COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN ALREADY LOCKED IN AGREEMENTS AS WELL AS A MENTOR ACOSTA INCREASES THAT OCCUR BECAUSE OF RATE INCREASES FOR HEALTHCARE FOR EXAMPLE THAT -- IN STOOD BY CALPERS AS WELL AS RICK -- RETIREMENT RATE INCREASES SO VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE FACT THAT THOSE. THOSE KIND OF THOSE BASS LINE ITEMS ARE COVERED IN IN IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. SO THIS IS -- PROPOSAL FULLY COVERS THE THAT CONTRACT WITH THE FACULTY TWO YEARS AGO ANOTHER BARGAINING UNITS THAT'S CORRECT WITH THAT WOULD THAT HOW LONG IS THAT CONTRACT ON THE FOR ALL OF WELL I'D SAY MOST OF THE CONTRACTS ARE GOING TO RUN THROUGH AYE. NINETEEN TWENTY TO NINETEEN TWENTY SO THE THE LA WAS WARNED US THAT THE ECONOMY IS NOT GOING TO KEEP. GOING AT THE SAME CLIP. AND OUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT YEAR IF WE HAD. NOT A CUT IN AND MONEY IN THE BUDGET BUT FLAT AMOUNTS. SO HOW DO WE FIND OUR OUR OUR CORE COSTS INCLUDING COMPENSATION HEALTH CARE AND WORKS ARE YOU ANTICIPATING THIS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE YEAR OR IF YOU I'M JUST SAYING HYPOTHETICALLY IN IN THE THIS IS THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BY. NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET TALK ABOUT SORT TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR HERE YOU'RE FROM NOW ON WE DON'T HAVE THE IF INCREASES WERE NOT. WE DON'T HAVE A A CUTS RISE REDUCTION IN CSU FUNDING LET'S SAY IT'S A FLAT LINE SAY IT'S FLAT. I CAN ANTICIPATE HOW COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WILL SHAKE OUT FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE YEAR BUT OBVIOUSLY IF THERE ISN'T ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO INCREASE -- COMPENSATION IT WOULD BE VERY HARD FOR US TO PROVIDE ANY SORT OF COMPENSATION TO ANY OF OUR STAFF BUT HOW WOULD YOU HONOR. THE CONTRACTS THAT ARE THROUGH. THAT YEAR. WELL. I THINK UNDER THE SCENARIO YOU'RE YOU'RE SUGGESTING WOULD BE IF THE BOTTOM FELL OUT OF THE NAY REVISION OF REVENUES AND WE HAVE A BUDGET PLAN IN NINETEEN TWENTY WHERE WE COULD FIND IS THAT. IS THAT KIND OF THE ASSUMPTION OR IS IT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE. THE THE THE COST THAT WE HAVE ANTICIPATED ARE FOR THE NINETEEN TWENTY YEAR NO I'LL TELL YOU OFFER TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE A YEAR FROM NOW OKAY I WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET OKAY -- WE DON'T HAVE ANYBODY UNDER CONTRACT -- FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND SO PRESUMABLY -- ALL. MOST COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS ARE GOING TO BE SUN SHINING OR OPENING UP ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS THIS SUMMER. AS WELL AS THE INTO THE WINTER FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE YEAR -- SO IF THE REVENUES ARE FLAT OR DOWN. AND IT IS A STRONG THERE'S STRONG SIGNAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATION OR THE LEGISLATURE THAT THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL FUNDING COMING THE WAY OF SEE ISSUE. THAT IT WOULD BE HARD FOR US TO EVEN CONTEMPLATE. INCREASE YOU KNOW INCREASING COMPETITION BY. ANY AMOUNT BUT THAT'S ALL VERY HYPOTHETICAL AND IT IT'S IT'S HARD TO SAY AT THIS POINT HOW WE WOULD LAND OBVIOUSLY IT. IT WILL. ULTIMATELY BE A NEGOTIATED BETWEEN THE LABOR -- OF FOLKS AS WELL AS THE C. ISSUE IN TERMS OF WHAT. CAN AND CANNOT BE DONE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE DEPENDING ON THE REVENUE PICTURE [inaudible] OKAY. I KNOW THEY'LL HAVE SOME PUBLIC COMMENT AS FAR AS YOUR SOME OF YOUR OTHER -- UNITS AS AS WELL AS ON THE ISSUE AS FAR AS COMPENSATION MR MEDINA. IF YOU COULD TO SEE ISSUE IF YOU COULD REFRESH MY MEMORY I'M NOT REMEMBERING IF CSU HAS IMPLEMENTED YET THE STEP INCREASES TO FACULTY. IT IS NOT. SO SO THAT'S NOT INCLUDED IN THIS. NO NO THIS IS A THAT WHAT'S INCLUDED HERE -- FOR FOR THE FACULTY IT -- GROUP IS -- A GENERAL SALARY INCREASE. FOR FOR THE NINETEEN TWENTY YEAR THERE'S NO A STEP OR ANY ANY ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE [inaudible] THANK YOU. OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER BROWN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND PLEASE INDULGE I'M NEW TO THIS COMMITTEE ONE MONTH -- SO. TO SEE IT CSU BOARD NEGOTIATED TO THE BARGAINING UNIT AND AND COMES UP WITH A DEAL AND THEN YOU COME TO THE LEGISLATURE ASKS US TO FUND IT. IT KIND OF PUTS US IN A BAD SITUATION WHERE. IF WE DON'T WE LOOK LIKE THE BAD GUYS ON THE BOARD. NOW ALL WE TRIED BUT THEY THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE OF THE BUS HAS THAT ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE OR INCIDENT THAT WE GIVE YOU. A PART OF MONEY AND THEN THE C. ISSUE WOULD. TO PAY AND FACILITIES AND MAINTENANCE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WE JUST EDUCATE ON HOW THAT YEAH IT'S WE WOULD -- WE WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THAT IS IT THAT A TOUGH POSITION TO BE AND KIND OF COMPARING SEE ISSUE TO THE STATE SO THAT SO THE STATE HAS. HAS THE ABILITY TO KNOW HOW MUCH FUNDING IT COULD PUT TOWARDS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS GOING FORWARD AND HAS. MULTI YEAR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT REVENUE PICTURES ARE. CAN ALSO NEGOTIATE WITH WITHIN THE SAME REALM KNOWING HOW MUCH MONEY IT HAS AND KNOWING WHAT TERMS THAT CAN PROVIDE IN TERMS OF ITS. COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS SEE SHE WAS IN A TOUGH SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE FOR AS LONG AS CAN BE. IMAGINED WE'VE BEEN WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN. ON BEHALF BUT THAT'S A IT'S A HARD SITUATION TO BE IN BECAUSE WE TYPICALLY IS A STATE OR AS A SEASHORE LIVING OUT A YEAR BY YEAR IN TERMS OF FUNDING RIGHT SO. WE IN A IN ESSENCE HAVE TO BET ON THE COME SO TO SPEAK IN OUR IN OUR LONGER TERM COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. THAT THE STATE WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING -- GENERALLY SPEAKING THOUGH IN THE SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS HAVE -- CLOSELY BEEN ALIGNED WITH THE RATE OF INFLATION -- MAYBE A TOUCH A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN THAT BUT BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S THE WE ARENEGOTIATING CONTRACTS WHERE. WE ARE PUTTING YOU IN A IN A SPOT WHERE I THINK IT'S UNREASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT WE WOULD BE -- PLACING YOU IN A FIVE OR 6% INCREASE YEAR OVER YEAR KIND OF SITUATION SO IT IS A CHALLENGE FOR US FRANKLY -- BECAUSEONE IF YOU'RE NEGOTIATING YOUR TO OR YOU'RE THREE AND YOU'RE. CONTEMPLATING YOUR ONE IN TERMS OF WHETHER THE STATE'S GOING TO FUND THOSE AGREEMENTS IT IS A CHALLENGING POSITION TO BE IN BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT'S BEEN FOR MANY MANY YEARS. SO YOU MENTIONED THAT NO ONE'S UNDER CONTRACT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS THAT TYPICALLY HOW YOU NEGOTIATE IS AT A YEAR BY YEAR FIVE YEAR TEN YEAR DEAL. IT DEPENDS ON THE SEASON -- PROBABLY IN THE LAST FORTY FIVE YEARS THERE'S BEEN A CONCERTED EFFORT TO TRY TO NEGOTIATE LONGER TERM AGREEMENT SO A MAXIMUM ABOUT THREE YEARS. BUT THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES IN THE PAST WHERE THEY'VE JUST BEEN YEAR BY YEAR AGREEMENTS. OBVIOUSLY YOU YOU PROBABLY DO KNOW THAT THE TRADE OFFS -- YOU KNOW A YEAR OR TWO YEAR CONTRACT JUST REQUIRES A LOT OF EXTRA WORK IN TERMS OF NEGOTIATION AND AMONG THE PARTIES. AND HAVING A START UP THAT NEGOTIATION OVER AND OVER AGAIN YEAR AFTER YEAR THAT'S THAT'S A LOT OF WORK IN A BIG CHALLENGE -- SO MOST PEOPLE PREFER TO HAVE A A SHORTER -- SHORT TERM OR MAYBE A SEMI LONGER TERM AGREEMENT. OF ABOUT THREE YEARS BUT IT'S GOING TO ALWAYS DEPEND ON A LOT OF FACTORS IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON WHAT THE APPETITE IS FOR MULTI YEAR AGREEMENTS GOING TO AND ON THE FISCAL SITUATION STATE CALIFORNIA -- THE SORTS OF THINGS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. OKAY THANK YOU WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN AS WELL. ISSUE NUMBER FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. RANDI KATZ SAID THE PART OF FINANCE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY. CONSISTENT WITH AUTHORITY PROVIDED IN EDUCATION CODE SECTIONS 897-728-9770. FOUR CS I GUESS I SHOULD'VE WAITED FOR YOU TO CALL ME -- SIDE. CONSISTENT WITH THE FORTY CS YOU MAY USE IT SUPPORT APPROPRIATION FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS ADDRESSING NEEDS OF FACILITIES THAT SERVE ACADEMIC PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION THIS A TORTILLA ALLOWS YOU SEE OUR CSU TO FINANCE THE COST OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS OF ACADEMIC FACILITIES THE RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY SINCE YOU SUBMITTED TWENTY TWO CAP OUT LATER QUESTS INCLUDING STATE WHAT INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS -- CONSISTENT WITH FUNDING AVAILABLE AVAILABILITY APPROVED BY TRUSTEES IN 200-016-2000 EIGHTEEN FINANCES PROVIDED PRELIMINARY APPROVAL FOR ELEVEN QUALIFYING PROJECTS AND SYSTEM MIGHT INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS AS REFLECTED ON PAGE NINETEEN OF THIS AGENDA. A CURRENT LAW LIMITS ISSUES CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO NO MORE THAN 12% OF ITS SUPPORT APPROPRIATIONS NOTED THAT SERVICE -- ONCE FUNDED -- PROJECTED MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE WILL BE NINE POINT 7% ABOUT HALF ON DEBT SERVICE AND HALF CASH FUNDING. FOR THE SAN DIEGO DRAMATIC ARTS INNOVATION PROJECT A FINANCE NOTES THAT CS USE US BASED GUIDELINES AUTHORIZED ALL CAMPUSES WITH ENROLLMENT EXCEEDING FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS SUCH AS THE ISSUE SAN DIEGO. THAT BOTH A FIVE HUNDRED SEAT SMALL THEATER AND A BLACK BOX THEATRE. THE SECOND BLACK BOX THEATRE ALLOWS FOR MULTIPLE STAGE CONFIGURATIONS GIVEN THE FLEXIBILITY THE HOST -- THAT DOES PRODUCTION SUCH AS THE TURNED AROUND OR RECITALS OR DANCES THAT MAY NOT WORK AS WELL IN THE TRADITIONAL THEATER. IN ADDITION TO THE CAP OUT WHEN ED CODE SECTION EIGHT NINE SEVEN SEVEN THREE THE GOVERNOR EXT -- BUDGET PROPOSES TWO HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION AND ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OR TO IMPROVE AND EXPAND CAMPUS BASED CHILD CARE FACILITY INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT STUDENT PARENTS -- REGARDING THE PROPOSED THAT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK LEGISLATIVE STAFF TO PROVIDE INFORMATION REGARDING THE PROPOSED DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING. ASSOCIATED PROJECTS TO ANSWER THE SPENDING THAT SHE DESIRED OUTCOMES HOWEVER. DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS ARE GENERALLY FUNDED FROM DEPARTMENTS BASED BUDGETS DEPARTMENTS DO NOT TYPICALLY PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING ON THESE PROJECTS AND RELATED EXPENDITURES. ALSO AND MAYBE MORE BENEFICIAL AND INFORMATIVE FOR STAFF IN THE LEGISLATURE TO REQUEST THE INFORMATION FROM THE APARTMENTS ON AN AS NEEDED BASIS. WITH REGARDS TO DEPARTMENTS ARE PROJECTS WHERE THERE MAY BE A SPECIFIC INTEREST OR CONCERN RATHER THAN IMPOSING A BROAD SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING REQUIREMENT AS PROPOSED IN THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU LA -- PAGE NINETEEN OF YOUR GENDER LIST THE PROJECTS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS PRELIMINARILYAPPROVED AND THAT ARE SUBJECT TO LEGISLATIVE REVIEW. CSU INDICATES A CAN FINANCE THESE PROJECTS WITHIN ITS EXISTING BUDGET TO TO DO TO DEBT REFINANCING OTHER ACTIONS IS MISTER KATZ MENTIONED. WE GENERALLY DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUE WITH THE PROJECTS LISTED WE DO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERED THE TRADE OFFS OF THE PROPOSED THEATER PROJECTS AT THE SAN DIEGO CAMPUS. THE PROJECT ENTAILS RENOVATING AN EXISTING THEATER TO MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE TO PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND THEN CONSTRUCTING A NEW SECOND THEATER AT AN ADJACENT LOCATION. BY BUILDING A SECOND THEATER THE CAMPUS SAYS IT'LL BE ABLE TO MAIN STAGE MULTIPLE PERFORMANCES AT THE SAME TIME. SO THE CAMPUS PROPOSAL DOES NOTE THAT -- THAT AN ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE JUST TO RENOVATE THE EXISTING THEATRE WITHOUT ADDING THE SECOND THEATER. AND THIS ALTERNATIVE WHICH WOULD COST ABOUT SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS LESS ABOUT HALF THE COST OF THE COMBINED. RENOVATION A NEW THEATER PROPOSAL SO IN THE IN ASSESSING THE PROPOSAL. THE GOOD LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO WEIGH THE TRADE OFFS. IN THE BENEFIT OF HAVING TO THEATERS TO STAGE MULTIPLE PERFORMANCES WHETHER THAT OUTWEIGHS THE ADDITIONAL COST ANOTHER POSSIBLE PROJECTS THE COULD BE FUNDED WITH. SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. REGARDING THE GOVERNOR'S DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROPOSAL PROVIDING ONE TIME MONIES. THE GOVERNOR HAS SAID PROPOSAL FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FOR NUMBER OF AGENCIES THIS YEAR. WE DO THINK THAT FINDING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS A GOOD USE OF ONE TIME RESOURCES. AS YOU SEE ON PAGE TWENTY OF THE AGENDA WE DO THINK THAT MORE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. WOULD BE WARRANTED THAT WOULD INCLUDE KNOWING AHEAD OF TIME THE SPECIFIC PROJECTS THAT CSU INTENDS TO UNDERTAKE AND CSU IS WELL ON THEIR WAY AND PROVIDING -- GOOD UNDERSTANDING FOR THE LEGISLATURE ON THOSE PROJECTS IT WOULD LIKE -- TO FUND -- ALSO WE RECOMMEND -- THE LEGISLATURE HAVE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REPORT AFTERWARD ON THE STATUS OF OF THE PROJECT WHETHER THEY WERE COMPLETED. AND THEN ALSO FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO WORK WITH CSU TO DEVELOP A LONG TERM PLAN. TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG AND JUST TO IMPROVE. CS USE MAINTENANCE PRACTICES GOING FORWARD SO YOU DON'T HAVE ANOTHER BACKLOG DEVELOP IN A NUMBER OF YEARS. THE GOVERNOR HAS A PROPOSAL. THAT WOULD ALLOW CAMPUSES TO USE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE MONEY FOR OUR CAMPUS CHILD CARE FACILITIES. OF ON THIS ONE THE LEGISLATURE WILL JUST WANT TO KNOW BASIC INFORMATION WHICH WHICH PROJECTS WOULD NEED WHAT I NEED TO BE FUNDED AND WHY WHAT THE JUSTIFICATION IS THE COST THE LOCATION. REALLY JUST THE SAME BASIC INFORMATION LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO ASSESS ANY FACILITIES PROJECT REQUEST THANK YOU. HI GOOD MORNING VICE AND ONE SISTER VICE CHANCELLOR FOR CAPITAL PLANNING DESIGNING CONSTRUCTION FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR. THE THE THE LA ALL RIGHT UP NOTES AND AND MISTER KATZ IS NOTED THE AUTHORITY THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN STATE GRANTED THE CSU TO USE OUR OWN FUNDS TO GET FUND CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS. AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE SINCE THAT TIME IS IN OUR FIVE YEAR PLAN HAS PROVIDED INFORMATION ON WHAT WE HAVE FUNDED FROM. NOT ONLY THE PROJECTS USING OUR OWN FUNDS BUT ALSO THOSE PROJECTS APPROVED TO THE CAMPUSES USING THE STATE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE DOLLARS. SO THAT'S SUB ABOUT NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF THE LAST FEW YEARS SO WHAT ARE FIVE YEAR PLAN WE REPORT. THOSE PROJECTS AT BUDGET LEVEL SO IT'S NOT THE ACTUAL SAID THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S RECOMMENDS BUT WE DO REPORT THAT NOW. AND ALSO INCLUDES ACADEMIC PROJECTS IN SELF SUPPORT PROJECTS SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT -- WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH DOING IT MORE DIFFICULT WITH. OF FINANCIAL ACTUAL SPORTS COULD CERTAINLY DO THAT. THE TRUSTEES FOLLOW THE PRIORITIES AS FAR AS CAPITAL OUTLAY THAT -- THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RECOMMENDS. AND WE'VE BEEN FUNDING IN AN AMOUNT OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE USE THEIR OWN FUNDS AND IT REDUCE IT BY ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION. IN OUR FIVE YEAR PLAN WE ALSO IS AN ATTEMPT TO INCREASE THE CAMPUS AWARENESS WE PUBLISH THE BACKLOG BY CAMPUS WE PUBLISH AND HOW MUCH THEY SHOULD BE FUNDING FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. AND HOW MUCH THEY WOULD HAVE TO FUND TO ELIMINATE THE BACKLOG. SO THAT WOULD GO FROM AND AN ANNUAL NEED OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION JUST TO CHIP AWAY AT THE BACKLOG. BUT TO ELIMINATE IT COMPLETELY OVER TIME WOULD RAISE IT TO OVER SIX HUNDRED MILLION. SO AS FAR AS THE CSU PLANNED COMING UP WITH SIX HUNDRED MILLION IS NOT VERY EASY GIVEN OUR OUR PRIORITIES IN A SYSTEM IN COMPETING NEEDS. AS MENTIONED EARLIER TODAY AS FAR AS ENROLLMENT COMPENSATION BRAD INITIATIVE BUT WE ARE CERTAINLY SOME OF THE PRIEST OF OF THE ONE TIME FUNDS THE TWO HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION INCLUDING IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. BUT WE CAN ALSO USE THE THE PERMANENT BASE FUNDS OF EIGHTY MILLION THAT WAS NOT INCLUDED BUT CERTAINLY WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP US FIND ADDITIONAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OVER TIME. WITH REGARD TO THE CHILD CARE CENTERS WE DO HAVE A RANGE OF CAMPS IS REQUESTING DOLLARS FROM A HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR PROJECT ABOUT THIRTY MILLION SO WE ARE STILL COLLECTING INFORMATION AND HELP TO COME BACK TO LATER THIS THE SPRING WITH MORE INFORMATION. AND A FIRE FINAL PRIORITIES. AS OF THE LA -- MENTION WE DO HAVE THE PRIORITY LIST IN -- IN THE WORKS FOR THE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN MILLION FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT'S ONE OF THE SPEND SOURCES WE HAVE FOR THAT WE'VE ASKED. FOR BECAUSE WE TAKE A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH APPROACH WITH DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NATALIE USING OUR FUNDS THROUGH INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS BUT ASKING FUNDS FOR THE STATE AS FAR AS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AND THEN LEVERAGING THOSE DOLLARS TO GET THE CAMPUS TO FUND THAT ADDITIONAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OUT OF THEIR OWN OPERATING BUDGET. SO IT IS IT IS A DIFFICULT -- CHALLENGE IT'S BEEN WITH US AND ONLY GROWING SINCE I'VE WORKED FOR THE CSU BUT AM HAPPY -- FOR THE FUNDING THAT'S IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND AND APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT HAPPY ANSWERING QUESTIONS. MR O'DONNELL YES THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF IT IS FROM A IF WE BACK UP MY CONCERN WITH THE CSU SYSTEM AS A WHOLE CERTAINLY THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AND THAT'S IS SIGNIFICANT ISSUE BUT ALSO THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR FACILITIES IN OTHER WORDS THE PLANNING. NOT NECESSARILY THE MICRO LEVEL WHAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY -- BUT BUT THE PLANNING AND I BRING THE PERSPECTIVE OF ONE OF GRADUATING CSU TWICE MY BACHELOR'S OR MASTER'S I'M A FAN -- AND BUT I WALK THROUGH LONG BEACH STATE JUST ABOUT EVERY DAY WHEN I'M AT HOME. THE DOG EARLY IN THE MORNING SO I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON THERE -- AND VARIETY REASONS BUT BUT AGAIN DO YOU DO YOU HAVE A CENTRAL CLEARINGHOUSE FOR THE PLANNING OF FACILITIES ON THE CSU CAMPUS. SO ON A CAMPUS -- CHEN LINES I WANT PLAN SOMETHING IS IT CLEAR TO SOME OTHER LEVEL OTHER THAN JUST DECIDED AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL. IT COMES THROUGH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE CAPITAL PLANNING DESIGN CONSTRUCTION. SO WE BRING WE COLLECT ALL THE PRIORITIZE PROJECTS FROM THE CAMPUSES WE CREATE A FIVE YEAR PLAN BASED ON WHAT THEY SUBMIT. AND THEN PRESENT A RECOMMENDED PRIVATIZATION TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND THAT IS OUR MASTER PLAN FOR EACH CAMPUS THERE IS A MASTER PLAN IN OUR FIVE YEAR PLAN AS WELL. SO WHAT ABOUT WHEN I CAMPUS SIZE THEY WANT TO BUILD SOMETHING WITH -- MAYBE THE RACE AND DOLLARS FOR BUILDING IT'S NOT AND I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT EVEN A CORE FUNCTION. WITH WITH THAT GO THROUGH THE THIS SENIOR LEVELS IF YOU WILL. ANYTHINGOVER 700-100-0700 NINE THOUSAND WHICH IS THE DEFINITION FOR MINOR CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECT COMES THROUGH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ONE OF MY CONCERNS ONE OF THINGS I'M NOTICING IN MAY AND I COULD BE WRONG SO PLEASE CORRECT ME. AS I SEE A LOT OF EFFORT GOING INTO RAISING MONEY FOR SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE A NOT COR FOR A NON CORE FUNCTION LIKE AN ALUMNI CENTER LOBBY STATE. WAS VERY CONTROVERSY ON LARRY AND I'LL GET TO THAT -- SO A LOT OF MONEY RACE FOR THAT BUT THEN THERE WILL BE -- BUILDING LIKE MOMMY STATE PETERSON HALL THAT'S IN NEED OF WORK. AND I DON'T REALLY SEE AN EFFORT ASSOCIATE THE RAISING DOLLARS FOR THAT -- MAYBE PUTTING SOMEONE'S NAME ON IT FINE WITH ME WE GO ACROSS MANY CAMPUS UNIVERSITIES NON CSU NON USE EVEN YOU SEE THAT HAVE DIFFERENT NAMES ON THEM BECAUSE THE MONEY THAN RACE BUT THERE. THEY SPEAK TO THE CORE FUNCTION OF THE UNIVERSITY THEIR EDUCATION RELATED. BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS MAYBE SOME THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY YOU KNOW IT'S A CORE FUNCTION CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT. I WOULD SAY THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN BUILDINGS DONORS ARE MORE INTERESTED IN SUPPORTING. THERE IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR EXAMPLE TO GET DONOR FUNDS FOR AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT. SO IT MAY BE THAT AND ALUMNI CENTER ATTRACTS MORE SUPPORT FROM THE DONORS. AND AT A PROJECT LIKE A PETERSON REPLACEMENT IT MAY BE A NAMING FOR THAT BUILDING THAT WOULD BE THE OPPORTUNITY OR CERTAIN ROOMS THE CAMPUSES ARE TRYING TO INCREASE THE CO FUNDING FOR THE PROJECTS WE'VE ASKED. THEM TO PROVIDE A 10% CO FUNDING SO WHETHER THAT'S DONOR FUNDS FOR THEIR OWN IT'S A CHANCE TO LEVERAGE THE STATE AND SEE IF YOU DOLLARS WITH THEIR OWN. AND I WOULD SAY SOMETHING LIKE HELLO MY CENTERS A WANT SOMETHING LIKE REDOING APPEARS AND HALL WHATEVER IT MAY BE A CORE EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES AND NEED. AND SO MY CONCERNS IT'S SINCE. IS WHAT I'M NOTICING I COULD BE INCORRECT SO PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. IS IT JUST SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF EFFORT FOCUSING ON THESE NON CORE [inaudible] YOU KNOW. FACILITIES AS OPPOSED. TO THAT CORPS FACILITY WHICH ISN'T IT IS IMMEDIATE AN IMMEDIATE NEED OF ATTENTION. IT MAY ALSO. REFLECT THAT FOR ELEVEN I CENTER WE WOULD NOT PRIORITIZE THAT USING STATE DOLLARS OR CSU FUNDS. BECAUSE IT'S NON ACADEMIC IT IS -- PART OF THE THE FACILITIES CAMPUSES WANT TO ATTRACT DONORS AND SUPPORT THEIR THEIR POPULATION BASE BUT WHEN WE ASK THE STATE FOR EIGHTY MILLION TO FINANCE ACADEMIC FACILITIES THE ALUMNI CENTER WOULD NOT BE WHEN WE WOULD. AYE AYE INVOLVED IN THAT BUT MY MY WORRY IS THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT -- THE EFFORT THAT WOULD SUCK UP ALL THE ENERGY GEE I WANT THIS THING AS OPPOSED TO YOU KNOW I WHAT MY WANT VERSUS MY NEED MIKE MY MY CONCERN IS THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT GOING INTO WORK ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AS OPPOSED TO MAYBE SPENDING TIME ON A CORE FACILITY BUT THAT'S GOOD THANK YOU AND I WALK THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY MANY TIMES ON A FRIDAY NOBODY'S THERE. WHAT'S GOING ON ON THAT FRONT TO INCREASE I MEAN WHEN I WENT TO LONG BEACH STATE I WAS THERE ON FRIDAYS. BUT TODAY IT SEEMS LIKE THERE AREN'T VERY MANY PEOPLE THERE ON FRIDAYS WHAT ARE WE DOING TO ADDRESS. THE MAXIMUM USE THE FACILITIES AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT IF YOU IF YOU LOOK AT THE CS YOU'VE IS THE CSU FACILITIES. THEY'RE PRETTY HEAVILY AS I GET THAT BUT PRETTY HEAVILY IS MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WHAT'S GOING ON WITH. WITH THAT I RESTATE CLASSES THEY GO MONDAY WEDNESDAY FRIDAY. WHEN IT HAPPENING OUT THERE THAT I'M NOT AWARE FROM THIS? I AGREE WE ARE ALSO TRYING TO ENCOURAGE THE CAMPUS IS TO OPEN UP THE CAMPUSES AND AND THREE OF OUR TRUSTEES HAVE ASKED US. TO TO LOOK AT NOT ONLY FRIDAYS BUT SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS AS WELL SO ESPECIALLY WITH THE INCREASE ENROLLMENT HOW WE CAN ACCOMMODATE THE THE CAPACITY PROVIDE ACCESS. IT SAYS CERTAINLY THINK SOMETHING THAT THE WOULD BE EASY TO DO IF WE HAD THE SOMETIMES A FACULTY WANTING TO TEACH THOSE DAYS SO SOMETHING WE NEED TO WORK ON A GOOGLE SEARCH A FACULTY MEMBER SCHEDULES AND THEN A MANAGEMENT. PROGRAM. TEENS I THINK WOULD HAVE THE SAY ON THAT SORRY. DEANS OF THE DEPARTMENT I BELIEVE HAVE THE SAY ON THAT BEN AND MIGHT VISITS ALREADY. SCHEDULED WAS. COVERAGE ON THE ACADEMIC SIDE WILL AND AND BRIAN MAY ALSO HAVE A RESPONSE BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WORKING ON WE RECOGNIZE THAT JUST A LOT OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. I THINK THE OTHER THING TO ADD TO IT IS IS THAT -- YOU KNOW -- A CAMPUS. MOST OF OUR CAMPUSES ARNETT CAPACITY. RIGHT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MAYBE FRIDAYS OR SATURDAYS RIGHT NOT A CAPACITY AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE OF A LOT OF A LACK OF FACILITIES RIGHT WE HAVE LOTS OF FACILITIES AND WANT TO SPACE I THINK THE REAL CHALLENGE. IS BEING ABLE TO FUNDED THAT CAPACITY SO IF. IF -- WE HAVE I DON'T KNOW HOW BIG LONG BEACH IS MASTER PHYSICAL MASTER PLAN IS BUT IT COULD BE FIVE OR TEN THOUSAND MORE STUDENTS COULD PHYSICALLY BE ON THAT PARTICULAR CAMPUS. THE CHALLENGES THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES IN ORDER TO OFFERED MISSION TO SO MANY MORE STUDENTS WHICH WOULD MEAN WE HAVE NOT ENOUGH ROOM. ON ON MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY SO THAT WE CAN. PUSH AND FRIDAYS AND SATURDAYS AND OFFER MORE COURSES BECAUSE THERE ARE THAT MANY STUDENTS AND THAT MANY FACULTY THAT NEED THOSE LIMITED RESOURCES SO. IN LONG BEACH CASE IT MAY BE THAT THEY JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FUNDING IN ORDER OFFER. ALL THE COURSES -- THAT WOULD NOT THEY HAVE A FUNDING OFFER ALL THE EXISTING COURSES BUT THEY COULD OFFER POTENTIALLY MORE IF THERE WAS ADDITIONAL ENROLLMENT FUNDING OR GRAD MISSION OF FUNDING OFFERED WHERE YOU WOULD SEE MUCH MORE TRAFFIC PROBABLY ON A FRIDAY. I DON'T THAT'S HELPFUL OR NOT BUT THE BUT THE POINT IS TO SAY. THAT -- YOU YOU NEED THE OPERATING FUNDS IN ORDER TO FILL THAT FACILITY. UNDERSTOOD BUT ISN'T IT TRUE THAT HE DID OFFER COURSES ON FRIDAY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. THE PRESSURE ON THE FACILITIES WE BE LESS AND ON AVERAGE. SURE YEAH BUT YOU'RE STILL INCREASING TOTAL HOURS OF USE CRACKED AND I I RECOGNIZE THAT BUT THEN THE NECESSITY TO BUILD MORE FACILITIES. THE PRESSURE TO BUILD MY MORE FACILITIES MIGHT BE LESSEN THAT'S RIGHT. AND AND SO IT ON THE UNIVERSITY -- CAMPUS ARE ARE ARE THEY SHARING SPACE. I MEAN HOW HOW DOES THIS WORK FOR THE THE LECTURE SPACES TYPICALLY SHARED. INTERDISCIPLINARY SPACE OF THE LAB SPECIFIC TEACHING LAB UPPER DIVISION MOST LIKELY DID NOT EASILY SHARED BUT IN OUR OUR NEW PROGRAMS WE'RE SEEING CAMPUSES WANT GREATER INTERDISCIPLINARY. MAKER PROJECTS SPACE WHERE THEY CAN HAVE MORE COLLABORATION THAT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE'RE SEEING IN A NUMBER OF THE CAMPUS PROPOSALS. OKAY AND THE U. S. -- FOR GOVERNOR PROVIDES TWENTY FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FOR TO PAY FOR CAMPUS BASED CHILD CARE FACILITIES. WITH A CHILD CARE FACILITY BE SOMEWHAT OF AN ENTERPRISE FUND. WE DON'T NECESSARILY WHEN SEE ISSUES DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY. TO SERVICE THEIR CORE FUNCTION NOW ARE WE GONNA PUT THEM INTO THE DAY CARE BUSINESS. IT IS A BIT OF A MIXED MOST OF THE CHILD CARE FOR STUDENTS ARE THROWN THROUGH THE CELL SUPPORT PROGRAM. AND THIS WOULD BE FOR THE FACILITY THEY WILL BE CAREFUL THAT THOUGH THAT'S SAYING NO AS MUCH AS WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL OF WE'RE GONNA. START. BUILDING CHILDCARE FACILITIES ALL OVER THE CAMPUS WHEN WE DON'T EVEN HAVE ADEQUATE FACILITIES FOR THE STUDENTS. WE NEED TO FIND THAT BALANCE SENATE EITHER THEIR ACADEMIC PROGRAMS AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT KINESIOLOGY -- THAT HAVE STUDENTS OF AS PART OF THEIR CLASS ACADEMIC CURRICULUM. BUT JUST TO JUST TO ADD TO THAT -- SIMMER O'DONNELL -- ONE THING THAT WE WE WOULD WANT TO DO AS A C. ISSUE SYSTEM IS OBVIOUSLY DEDICATE MOST OF THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE TO THE ACADEMIC PROGRAM THAT WE JUST WERE DISCUSSING RIGHT -- WE ALSO REALIZE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD LIKE. A CHILD CARE FACILITIES TO HAVE STE THAT THERE BE SOME FOCUS ON THAT AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT BUT I JUST WANT TO PUT OUT THERE THAT -- THAT THERE THERE SHOULD BE ANY CONFUSION THAT WE WOULD. WE WOULD SPEND SAY MAY MAYBE 50% OF THIS FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND THE OTHER HALF TO ECONOMIC OUR PREFERENCE WOULD BE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF FUNDING IS FOR THE ACADEMIC FACILITIES AND FOR INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS. BUT WHEN VICE GROUP IS DONE ASSESSING THE NEED OF THESE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION CENTERS. THAT IF THERE IS A DIRE NEED ON A PARTICULAR -- FACILITY. SIGNIFICANT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OR OTHER ISSUE THEN WE WOULD BE MORE THAN WILLING TO TO CONSIDER THAT IN TERMS OF FUNDING PARTS OF THAT. CAN BE AND REMEMBER THOSE ARE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO BE. MAINTAINED IN A MUCH MORE DIFFERENT FASHION IN THE TYPICAL CLASSROOM. IS IT NEW STATE STANDARDS BEING DEVELOP YOU HAVE KIDS YOU HAVE LITTLE KIDS ARE TOUCHING EVERYTHING IS NOT LIKE YOUR STANDARD CLASSROOM. WHICH WE'VE LET GO. SO I HAVE IT AND I KNOW PUT THAT ON YOU THAT'S IT THAT'S A FUNDING ISSUE WE HAVE WHAT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SO WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT UPON FOR SURE. BUT AGAIN FROM MY PERSPECTIVE VERY LOCAL ISSUE I'M FACING ON ALONG THE STATE CAMPUS IS A PLACEMENT OF AN ALARM I CENTER WHERE IT DOESN'T BELONG ABOUT THE NEIGHBORS AT MY THROAT -- THE CAMPUS ISN'T BUILT OUT THERE ARE OTHER PLACES TO PUT IT I'VE MET WITH THE PRESIDENT THE UNIVERSITY. DIDN'T GET AN ANSWER I MET WITH A CHANCE -- I DON'T WANNA KEEP THIS CONVERSATION UP. I WANT THIS PROBLEM I HAVE A VERY LOCAL LEVEL FIXED I'VE GOT. AGAIN THE ALUMNI CENTER THEN I HEAR MAYBE A DORM ROOM OVERLOOKING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL I GOT THE PTA MOMS COMING AT ME. A DORMS DON'T BELONG. A YOU KNOW SAID ACROSS THE STREET. FROM A A MULTI STORY DORM SAID ACROSS THE STREET FROM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WITH A LOOK DOWN. UPON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SO I EXPECT AN ANSWER FROM THE CSU SYSTEM. I'VE I HAVE BEEN I THINK I'VE DONE MY DUE DILIGENCE -- I'VE GOT NEIGHBORS COMING AT ME AND I THINK THEY'VE GOT. A PRETTY LEGITIMATE PERSPECTIVE WHEN THEY WERE PROMISED SOME OPEN SPACE WHEN THE WHEN THE BIG BLUE PYRAMID WAS BUILT YEARS AGO -- AND THEY WANT TO KEEP THAT OPEN SPACE THERE THERE ARE MANY IN OPEN SPACES ON THE CAMPUS I WANT TO WORK WITH THE UNIVERSITY. BUT I NEED THEM TO WORK WITH WITH ME I'VE MET WITH THEM AND AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AGAIN I DON'T WANT THIS CONVERSATION. TO GET TIED UP IN THE BUDGET BUT IT WILL OF IT HAS. TO THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. QUESTION MISTER -- WITH DONNA YES I WENT TO LONG BEACH STATE I KNOW HE LIVED IN THE EARL WARREN DORMS HOW ARE THOSE THE DORMS YOU TALK ABOUT I LIVE IN THE EARL WARREN TORN OVER THERE. WELL PARK SITE IS THAT THE ONE THAT WILL MY UNDERSTAND IS A THERE'S A PROTECT THEIR POTENTIALLY GOING TO CONSTRUCT ANOTHER MULTI STORY DORM -- ALONG AFTER TEN AT AND WHERE THAT BECOMES PROBLEMATIC IS IT OUT OF THE AREA AROUND THE UNIVERSITY IS BUILT OUT THERE'S HOMES THERE. PEOPLE DON'T WANT YOU KNOW. STUDENTS IN THE FOUR STORY OF THEIR DORM LOOKING INTO THEIR BACKYARDS. AND THERE'S ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THERE TOO AND THERE'S JUST. AB IN A THAT THERE ARE PLACES TO PUT IT I JUST DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE A PUTTING. THE ATHERTON COURT OR THERE. BUT I I WANT TO JUMP ON WHICH YOU SAID -- MR O'DONNELL AYE I KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT FOR FOCUSING ON FACILITIES I SUPPORT DOING THAT YEAH HI READ BOND. I THINK THAT WOULD -- LEVY AT SOME OF THE PRESSURE ON CSU AND YOU SEE TO FREE UP SOME OF THAT MONEY TO FOCUS ON ENROLLMENT AND GRADUATION INITIATIVES AND THAT WORKFORCE FACULTY ALL OUR OTHER PRIORITIES. BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT PROPERLY UTILIZING. OUR OUR FACILITIES. ON EVENINGS ON FRIDAYS AND WEEKENDS -- IF YOU LOOK AT THESE. SCANDAL DRIVEN. YOU KNOW THE NEWS FOR PROFIT COLLEGES THE TO FRIDAYS AND EMPTY EYES AND THE CURRENT THE IS ONE OUT OF BUSINESS. THE REASON THEY DID SO WELL IS BECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE TO SERVE STUDENTS AT THEIR TIMES AND IT WASN'T ALWAYS MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY THE TYPICAL HOURS THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE STUDENTS AND LOT OF FACULTY WANT TO TEACH -- BUT THEY'RE WORKING ON EVENINGS AND FRIDAYS AND SATURDAYS AND SO I THINK THAT. THAT'S A LESSON TO US THAT STUDENTS -- WANT TO GO TO GET THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION AT DIFFERENT TIMES. AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO STEP IT UP. AND AND HAVE THE ADMINISTRATION AND THEIR FACULTY MEMBERS YOU KNOW GET ON IT IN FOCUS AND UTILIZING. OUR CAMPUSES -- NO. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN AND INCLUDES THE SUMMER MONTHS AS WELL. OKAY WE'LL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN ISSUE NUMBER -- FIVE CAMPUS STUDY. GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TWO MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE CSU CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO UNDERTAKE A REVIEW OF A POTENTIAL CAMPUS IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY LIKELY STOCKTON. THE ADMINISTRATION ANTICIPATES THAT THIS PROPOSED REVIEW WOULD INCLUDE A STUDY THAT EXAMINES WHETHER A POTENTIAL CAMPUS IS MERITED IN THE AREA. AND OUTLINING CONSIDERATIONS FOR PRELIMINARY PLANNING IF SO. FURTHER DETAILS ON THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE PROVIDED WITH THE MAY REVISION WITH UPDATED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OKAY LA OF AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST NOTED THIS ISSUE IS MENTIONED IN THE GOVERNOR'S. JAN TEN BUDGET BUT WAS NOT PROPOSED IN BUDGET BUILDER TRAIL OF THE LEGISLATURE HASN'T SEEN THAT LANGUAGE YET. BUT COMING IT MAY REVISE IT SOUNDS LIKE SO I'M THINKING ABOUT. THE INITIAL PROPOSAL WE OFFER TWO ISSUES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. THE FACT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSING FUNDS FOR STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THE GOVERNOR WOULD LIKE TO ASSESS CERTAIN CRITERIA CERTAIN FACTORS BEFORE COMMITTING TO A NEW CAMPUS. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT YET CLARIFIED WHAT FACTORS IT WOULD LIKE TO CONSIDER SO WE'LL HAVE TO LOOK FOR THAT AS PAGE TWENTY THREE OF YOUR AGENDA NOTES. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE LEGISLATURE ASKED OUR OFFICE TO ASSESS WHETHER A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY WAS JUSTIFIED BASED ON ONE KEY FACTOR WHICH WAS PROJECTED ENROLLMENT AND PHYSICAL CAPACITY OF EXISTING CAMPUSES. IN THAT REPORT WE FOUND THAT THE STATE COULD ACCOMMODATE GROWTH IN MOST REGIONS INCLUDING THE CENTRAL VALLEY BY BUILDING OUT EXISTING CAMPUSES. WITH THAT SAID THE ADMINISTRATION MIGHT HAVE OTHER FACTORS IN MIND -- WHICH MIGHT INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE COMMUTING TIME. FOR STUDENTS TO TRAVEL TO A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY OR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE LOCAL. STOCKTON AREA SO LEGISLATURE WILL WANT. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHICH FACTORS THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD LIKE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHEN UNDERTAKING CAMPUS STUDY. THE LEGISLATURE. OF COURSE WILL ALSO WANT TO KNOW WHAT EXACTLY THE PROPOSED STUDY SCOPE WILL ENTAIL. FOR EXAMPLE IS THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS INTENDED TO COVER FACILITY PLANS FINANCING PLANS DEVELOPMENT OF ACADEMIC PROGRAMS. ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS SO LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO BE CLEAR ON WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION. WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PERFECT PROPOSED DELIVERABLES ARE [inaudible] THANK YOU. SO -- THE C. ISSUE HAS ESTABLISHED POLICY DECADES AGO ON ON HOW TO REVIEW -- THE IDEA OF BRENDA CAMPUSES FOR THIS ISSUE -- WITHIN THAT WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY -- IF WE WERE TASKED WITH THIS RESPONSIBILITY WE OBVIOUSLY -- HELP GATHER THE DATA WILL ANALYZE THE DATA SAYS THE ALTERNATIVES -- WE PREPARE FINAL REPORTS -- NO QUESTION WE'VE DONE THIS IN THE PAST WITH THE CHANNEL ISLANDS AND PRICE SAN MARCOS AS WELL AND NUMBER IN THE MOST RECENT PAST MONTEREY BAY -- SO THIS WOULD THIS WOULD BE NOTHING NEW IN TERMS OF OUR SOMETHING WE HAVE TO CREATE A NEW -- TRACK RECORD IN TERMS OF HAVING TO CREATE -- A PROCESS TO REVIEW THE NEED FOR NEW CAMPUS.% SO I THINK WHERE IT WHERE IT REALLY RESIDES IS IF YOU THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR AGREE ON THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL -- I THINK WHAT AND WHAT WILL EVENTUALLY HAPPEN IS IS THAT THE TASK IS WITH THAT RESPONSIBILITY WERE WILLING TO DO THE WORK ON IT. THANK YOU I I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS HERE OUT I'M IN. THE FULL SUPPORT OF OF A MORE HIGHER EDUCATION SERVICES AND UNDERSERVED AREAS LIKE LIKE THIS SAM LOOKING AREAS. SEVEN CAN COUNTY IN AND STOCKTON. JUST THAT -- I KNOW THIS IS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND IT WAS A PROPOSAL FROM THE CSU THE TWO MILLION RIGHT. RIGHT WAS A SOMETHING THAT YOU HAD REQUESTED OR TALK ABOUT. WE DIDN'T REQUEST THAT NATURE. AND SO IF IT WAS YOUR PREFERENCE. WHO WHAT DO YOU THINK SOME MORE -- EFFICIENT USE OF A COUPLE MILLION BUCKS WHETHER IT'S TWO THREE FOUR FIVE TO TO CREATE A NEW CAMPUS -- WHEN THERE'S A COUPLE JUST STUDENTS OR TO BUILD THAT THE EXISTING OFF CAMPUS CENTER? AND FOCUSING ON FACILITIES AND OF COURSE -- OFFERINGS IN ADDITIONAL FULL TIME FACULTY. AND CAL LOOKING AT THE MODEL. OF SAN MARCOS VERY THE SET UP AN OFF CAMPUS CENTER FROM SAN DIEGO STATE AND WHEN THEY REACHED A CERTAIN THRESHOLD HAVE TRIGGER TO BECOME. A FULL FLEDGED CSU CAMPUS. WELL I THINK WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE REALLY GETTING IT THROUGH THAT HERE'S THIS ACCESS RIGHT DIGITAL ACCESS FOR STUDENTS RIGHT. SO -- IT'S THE MOST DIRECT WAY TO DO THAT IS TO INCREASE FUNDING ON THE GRANDEST OF SIDE OR ON ENROLLMENT GROWTH RIGHT THAT'S IMMEDIATE. THING THAT CONNECT THAT THAT CAN BRING IN NEW ACCESS TO THE UNIVERSITY. I THINK THE THE SITUATION WITH MAYBE A STOCKTON CAMPUS WOULD BE YOU IF IT THIS WILL BE A DELAYED OR IT -- A PRO LONG TO SORT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF YOU GETTING TO ACCESS EVENTUALLY RIGHT SO YOU'D HAVE TO FIRST START LOOKING AT WHETHER THERE NEEDS TO BE AN EXPANSION OF THE OFF CAMPUS CENTER. OR A BRAND NEW CAMPUS THEN IT WOULD THAT ENTAIL LATER ON ADDING FUNDING THROUGH GRAD IT SHOULD HAVE WARNED ROME THE GROWTH FOR ADDITIONAL ACCESS AT THAT FACILITY SO IT'S REALLY KIND OF A TRADE OFF. FOR YOU FOLKS IF YOU WANT A INSTANT GRATIFICATION SO TO SPEAK OF AN INCREASING ENROLLMENT WITH THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING OR WHETHER YOU WANT TO PLAN FOR THE FUTURE AND BILL CAPACITY IN CERTAIN REGIONS OF THE STATE SO IT'S I I CAN'T GIVE YOU A RECOMMENDATION ONE WAY OR THE OTHER -- IN TERMS OF TO OUR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF THE SEA ISSUE. DICTATING OR SUGGESTING WHICH WAY TO GO ON THIS IT'S IT'S IT'S WITHIN YOUR PURVIEW OBVIOUSLY. I'M LOOKING AT MY NOTES HERE AND IT SAYS -- OTHER REQUEST MAY BE PENDING [inaudible] SO -- STOCKTON IS NOT THE ONLY AREA IN THE PARK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO IS INTERESTED IN HAVING YOU CSU CAMPUSES. SO MY QUESTION. TO ALL OF YOU. WOULD BE IS THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS PERHAPS OF PREMATURE. GIVEN THAT THERE ARE OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE WHO ARE ALSO INTERESTED. IN HAVING CSU CAMPUSES -- MY NOTES I HAVE. THAT -- THERE'S INTEREST IN PALM DESERT I KNOW THERE'S INTEREST IN AND IN THE SAN DIEGO AREA AND ANOTHER PART OF THE STATE SO MY QUESTION TO ALL OF YOU. IS THIS TWO MILLION DOLLARS PERHAPS PREMATURE. REQUEST. THE THIRD WE ARE AWARE OF THE ADMINISTRATION IS AWARE OF INTEREST IN CSU CAMPUSES IN OTHER REGIONS OF THE STATE WE'VE SEEN POLICY BILLS IN RECENT YEARS THAT I HAVE PROPOSED SECTION VARIOUS AREAS -- THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL FOR THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO EXAMINE A POTENTIAL NEW CAMPUS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY AREA SPECIFICALLY. WAS REALLY DRIVEN BASED ON A KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT REAL PERSONAL INCOME IN THAT AREA IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE. AS WELL AS UNEMPLOYMENT BEING NEARLY DOUBLE THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE BASED ON TWENTY SEVENTEEN INFORMATION. AND WE'VE SEEN IN THAT REGION AN INCREASING OVERALL NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES BUT A LOWER THAN AVERAGE NUMBER. WHO MEET REQUIREMENTS TO FOR ADMISSION TO A YOU SEE OR CSU SO IT WAS AN AREA THAT WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE ADMINISTRATION IS A PRIORITY FOR EXPLORATION OF A POTENTIAL CAMPUS -- ACKNOWLEDGING AGAIN THAT THE STUDY WOULD NOT NECESSARILY PRESUPPOSE THAT THERE IS MERIT HAVING THE CAMPUS THERE BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE INTERESTED IN HAVING THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE LOOK AT A NUMBER OF FACTORS OF THE BENEFITS. POTENTIALLY OF LOCATING A CAMPUS AS WELL AS WHAT THE PRELIMINARY PLANNING WOULD LOOK LIKE IF THEY WERE TO DO SO. AND TO SPEAK TO SOME OF MISTER STORMS EARLIER COMMENTS REGARDING SORT OF SOME TRADE OFFS BETWEEN ENROLLMENT FUNDING -- GRADUATION INITIATIVE FUNDING PRIORITIES LIKE THAT THAT INCREASE ACCESS COMPARED. TO EXPANDING TO A NEW POTENTIAL CAMPUS -- THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD SEE THOSE ALL IMPORTANT PRIORITIES WHICH IS REFLECTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE MADE INVESTMENTS AND ALL OF THOSE AREAS. I THINK AND MAYBE JUST A CARBON IT'S INTERESTING TO ME TO SEE WHAT THE THE THE PROCEDURE OR THE METHOD THAT WE USE. TO DETERMINE WHERE CAMPUSES I SHOULD BE BUILT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WHO IS BEST TO DETERMINE WHERE THOSE CAMPUSES. ARE NEEDED SO JUST A COMMON. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I HAVE A A BRIEF -- QUESTION ARE A FEW QUESTIONS -- HI I RECENTLY SAW. YOU JUST AS A POINT OF REFERENCE THAT -- THAT CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION IS INCREASE I BELIEVE IT WAS AROUND TWENTY TWENTY THREE MILLION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY AN HOUR APPROACHING FORTY MILLION -- IT DURING DURING THE PAST. FORTY YEARS -- HAMMER HOW MANY NEW CAMPUSES HAS YES YOU OPENED [inaudible] YOU KNOW. AT LEAST FOR AT LEAST FOUR WEEKS. FOR AND THE IF YOU HAVE A BALLPARK SENSE AS TO LIKE -- HELP HELP -- MUCH -- ENROLLMENT HAS INCREASED SINCE YES YOU IN THE LAST FORTY YEARS. WE WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT YEAH OKAY ALL RIGHT I MEAN I I'M JUST TO YOU KNOW OFTEN. WHEN WHEN I'M TALKING TO MY CONSTITUENTS AND THEY'RE THEY'RE ASKING ME ABOUT ELIZA SO MUCH HARDER TO GET INTO COLLEGE IN IN INTO OUR R. C. S. USING UC'S NOW -- THAN A WAS YOU KNOW A BACK IN THE DAY WHEN THEY ATTENDED AND I I ALWAYS TELL HIM WELL IT'S PRETTY EASY OUR OUR STATE'S POPULATION HAS DOUBLED IN THE LAST FORTY YEARS BUT OUR CAPACITY OR ARE HIGHER READ CAPACITY IS NOT DOUBLE. AND SO I I JUST WANTED -- TO IF IT IF I CAN GET THAT. NO INFORMATION NOW. LATER THEIR THAT THAT WOULD BE NICE -- SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS ON CAMPUS STUDY -- LIKE TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SIX BASIC NEEDS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO ASSIST CSU CAMPUSES IN THEIR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITY THANK YOU. IN A SURVEY OF CSU STUDENTS CONDUCTED THROUGHOUT RESPONDENTS REPORTED HAVING. FOOD AND SECURITY ABOUT 11% OF RESPONDENTS REPORTED EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WITHIN THE PREVIOUS YEAR. AS PAGE TWENTY FOUR OF YOUR GENDER NOTES RECENTLY THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED INCENTIVE GRANTS FOR CAMPUSES. TO HELP STUDENTS AND ROLL AND CAL FOR US WHICH IS THE STATE'S FOOD STAMPS PROGRAM. AS WELL AS OPERATE FOOD PANTRIES AND CREATE MEAL SHARING PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION TO THESE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES VARIOUS CAMPUSES OFFER OTHER SUPPORTS AND RESOURCES TO STUDENTS SUCH AS EMERGENCY HOUSING. AND HOUSING VOUCHERS. SINCE YOU STUDY FOUND THAT AT LEAST AT THE TIME MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES WERE UNDER UTILIZED. FOR EXAMPLE THREE QUARTERS OFSTUDENTS WHO ARE IDENTIFIED BY RESEARCHERS AS FOOD AND SECURE. HAD NEVER HEARD OF OR NEVER USE THE CAMPUS FOOD PANTRY YOUR AGENDA ON PAGES TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE DESCRIBES OTHER FINDINGS FROM CS USE LATEST LEGISLATIVE REPORT ON THE ISSUE. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME MONEY FOR BASIC NEEDS FOR PHIL CS USE. BUDGET REQUEST AND CSU INDICATES IT WOULD USE THE MONEY TO EXPAND PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL AGENCIES AND NON PROFITS THAT SPECIALIZE IN WORKING WITH FOOD IN SECURING HOMELESS POPULATIONS. AND IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE IDEA WOULD BE FOR THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO STUDENTS AND LINK THEM TO COMMUNITY RESOURCES -- WE HAVE A FEW ISSUES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER HERE FIRST THE ISSUE OF SUSTAINABILITY. ASSUMING CAMPUSES ARE ABLE TO USE THE PROPOSED FUNDS TO FORM COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO GET CLARIFICATION ON HOW CSU PLANS TO SUSTAIN THOSE RELATIONSHIPS ONCE THE ONE TIME MONEY RUNS OUT. SECOND THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH FOR CSU TO ESTABLISH CLEAR GOALS TARGETS IN METRIC SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE FUNDING THAT IT PROVIDES FOR CSU. THIRD THERE'S THE REALLY FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE ABOUT. HOW CSU STUDENTS GET RESOURCES TO GO TO COLLEGE YOU KNOW FINANCIAL AID AS A PRIMARY WAY STUDENTS COVER BASIC NEEDS SUCH AS ROOM AND BOARD AND? CURRENTLY THERE IS. THERE ARE INEQUITIES AMONG THE THREE SEGMENTS -- AND WHAT EIGHT IS PROVIDED TO STUDENTS CSU PROVIDES MORE AID FOR LIVING COSTS AND CSU EXCUSE ME YOU SEE PROVIDES MORE AID. FOR CSU FOR EXAMPLE AND STUDENTS AT CSU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS A RESULT MAY HAVE TO WORK LONGER HOURS FOR TAKE OUT MORE LOANS TO COVER THE REMAINING COSTS. A DESPITE YOU SEE HAVING THE MOST RESOURCES FOR THEIR STUDENTS UP FOR LIVING COSTS THE GOVERNOR'S ONLY PROPOSING ONGOING RESOURCES FOR YOU SEE HE'S PROPOSING FIFTEEN MILLION. ON GOING FOR YOU SEE FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME FOR CSU AND NO MISSION IS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE SO GIVEN THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER TO PRIORITIZE ONGOING FINANCIAL AID RESOURCES. FOR US YES YOU IN AND SEE IT AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOR THAT MATTER. ONE WAY TO DO THAT COULD BE. TO TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR CAL GRANT. BE ACCESS AWARDS WHICH PROVIDES MONEY FOR LIVING COSTS AND SERVES A LARGE NUMBER OF A COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN CSU STUDENTS SO JUST SOME THINGS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO KEEP IN MIND AS AN SS IS THIS. PROPOSAL AND THIS -- PERSISTENT PROBLEM THAT CSU AND OTHER SEGMENTS ARE IDENTIFYING. THANK YOU [inaudible] CSU. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS DENISE BADLY AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF STUDENT WELLNESS IN THE BASIC NEEDS INITIATIVE FOR THE CAL STATE SYSTEM. THIS THIS IS BASICALLY THE NEEDS INITIATIVE IS A SYSTEM WIDE EFFORT TO COORDINATE -- SERVICES ACROSS CAMPUSES TO HELP REACH STUDENTS IN SUPPORT NEED OF SUPPORT. THE INITIATIVE IS STRUCTURED AROUND A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK INVOLVING THE FIVE KEY AREAS OF ADDRESSING IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF STUDENTS GROWING CAMPUS BASED BASIC NEEDS SERVICES SO THEY CAN REACH ADDITIONAL STUDENTS. SCALING BEST PRACTICES FROM ONE CAMPUS TO ACROSS THE SYSTEM PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATIONS WITH LOCAL AGENCIES AND ENSURING LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF BASIC NEEDS SERVICES. AS AN EXAMPLE FOR STUDENTS STRUGGLING WITH FOOD AND SECURITY ALL TWENTY THREE OF OUR CAMPUSES EITHER HAVE A FOOD PANTRY OR FOOD DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM. ALL CAMPUSES PROVIDE CAL FRESH APPLICATION ASSISTANCE TO ELIGIBLE STUDENTS SO THAT THEY MAY HAVE HEALTHY. EATING OPTIONS IN FACT FROM AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO THE END OF JANUARY TWENTY NINETEEN THERE WERE OVER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND UNIQUE STUDENTS SERVE THERE ARE ON CAMPUS FOOD PANTRY. AND A MAJORITY OF CAMPUSES OFFER MEALS THROUGH MEAL SHARING OUR MEAL VOUCHER PROGRAMS DURING THAT SAME PERIOD CLOSE TO FORTY FOUR HUNDRED MEALS WERE DONATED. AND FIVE HUNDRED UNIQUE STUDENTS RECEIVED A DONATED MAIL. FOR GROWTH MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF OUR CAMPUSES OFFER ON CAMPUS EMERGENCY HOUSING OR VOUCHERS FOR OFF CAMPUS HOUSING. SEVERAL CAMPUSES PROVIDE STUDENTS FACING HOUSING A FACING A HOUSING EMERGENCY WITH HOTEL VOUCHERS TO PROVIDE SHORT TERM RELIEF AND THE CAMPUS WILL SERVE AS A COSIGNER OUR LEASE AGREEMENTS TO HELP STUDENTS TRANSITION INTO LONG TERM HOUSING. ONE OF THE BEST PRACTICES WE'VE SEEN USED TO ADDRESS STUDENTS SECURITY HAS BEEN TO CONNECT STUDENTS TO CAL FRONTS WE'VE ESTABLISHED CAL FRESH AT THE PILLAR OF OUR BASIC NEEDS WORK BY SCALING UP SYSTEM WIDE. WE'RE PROUD THAT IN THE CSU WE HAVE CHICO STATE WHICH IS THE LEAD. ORGANIZATION FOR TRAINING AND PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR ALL COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES DOING CAL FRESH OUT REGION APPLICATION ASSISTANCE IN CALIFORNIA. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN THE FIRST CAL FRESH CONTRACT WITH SIGN CHICO ONLY WORKED WITH TEN CSU CAMPUSES TOTAL. NOW CHICO STATE WILL BE WORKING WITH FORTY TWO CAMPUSES STATEWIDE INCLUDING NINETEEN CSU CAMPUSES. OUR PARTNERSHIP HAVE ALSO EXPANDED SIGNIFICANTLY THEY'RE CLOSE TO EIGHTY UNIQUE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT OUR CAMPUSES WORK WITH. NOT TO MENTION OUR CLOSE TIES WITH OTHER SISTER HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS THE CALIFORNIA HIGHER EDUCATION BASIC NEEDS ALLIANCE IS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE CSU UC AND CTC SYSTEM. WITH VARIOUS STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION THE CSU UNDERSTANDS THAT BASIC NEEDS IS A PART OF A LARGER ISSUE THAT GOES BEYOND OUR CAMPUS WALLS. AND BECAUSE OF THIS WE NEED TO CONNECT WITH PARTNERS THAT HAVE EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES THAT CAN BENEFIT OUR STUDENTS. AND FINALLY FOR SINCE THEY IN ABILITY ONE EXAMPLE WE ARE HAPPY TO REPORT ON IS THE ADDITION. TO OUR CALVET DATE APPLY APPLICATION STARTING IN FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE ADDED A QUESTION TO OUR CALVET APPLY APPLICATION. WHICH IS THE APPLICATION FOR ALL FIRST TIME STUDENTS ASKING IF THEY WERE INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE INFORMATION ABOUT CAL FRESH. JUST A SINGLE QUESTION WILL HELP ESTABLISH WHAT STUDENTS ARE INTERESTED IN POSSIBLY ELIGIBLE FOR CALTRANS. SINCE SEPTEMBER WE'VE HAD OVER A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS CHECK THAT YES BOX WHICH IS A LITTLE OVER HALF OF ALL STUDENTS THAT HAVE APPLIED FOR CAP THE FOURTH YES YOU. THIS IS SCALABLE CHANGE WILL ALLOW CAMPUSES TO SEE WHICH STUDENTS ARE INTERESTED AND LIKELY ELIGIBLE AND WILL ALLOW THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE. TARGETED OUR REACH. THE CURRENT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME FINDING BUDGET ASK IT'S FOR EXPANDING OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL SUPPORT AGENCIES AS WELL AS SUPPORTING HOLISTIC WELL BEING. INCLUDING ME ENHANCEMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALTH PROMOTION PROGRAMS ON CAMPUS A FEW EXAMPLES OF THIS INCLUDE INTEGRATING A WELLBEING TECHNOLOGY PROP PLATFORM. PILOT TESTING SEVERAL HOUSING STRATEGIES CONNECTING WITH CONTINUUM OF CARE AGENCIES STATEWIDE. ONGOING ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT PROGRAMS AND STRATEGIES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE BEST WAYS TO ENGAGE STUDENTS. WE KNOW THAT THERE IS MUCH WORK TO BE DONE BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL LATE LEGISLATIVE ALLIES TO HELP US ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY QUESTIONS FROM [inaudible] MISTER GELLER [inaudible] TINA [inaudible] HELLO MY YOU KNOW. YOUR POINT ABOUT -- NOT HAVING THE CONTINUING FUNDING FOR CS YOU ARE DOING THAT FOR YOU SEE. ME I THINK THERE'S JUST AS MUCH JUSTIFICATION. FOR DOING THAT THE CSU A PROBLEM I WOULD ARGUE MORE -- SO I MEAN I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY IN THE MAY BE THE AS HE SAID THE REFORMS TO THE CAL GRANT BE -- MIGHT BE A WAY. TO YOU HELP ADDRESS THAT ISSUE -- SO. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS HAD ANY RESPONSE TO THAT BUT GO AHEAD. I DO -- SO WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE IS THEY'VE -- THEY'VE RECEIVED REQUESTS BOTH FROM YOU SEE AND FROM C. ISSUE ARE YOU UNIQUE -- REQUESTS HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT. SO UC'S WAS A ONE AS AN ONGOING REQUEST OURS IS A ONE TIME. REQUEST AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SUPPORTED THAT BY INCLUDING THOSE ELEMENTS IN OUR RESPECTIVE BUDGETS. I THINK IN TERMS OF THE ON GOING NOTION OF THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD NEED TO TAKE BACK TO OUR BOARD AND OUR LEADERSHIP. TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE WANTED TO MAKE IT A AN ONGOING SORT OF ENDEAVOR AT THIS POINT TIME WE FEEL LIKE -- AS AS DR BEVERLY WAS TALKING ABOUT. ESTABLISHING THOSE PARTNERSHIPS -- REQUIRES ONE TIME MONIES AND WE FEEL THAT THAT'S PROBABLY THE THE THE BEST USE OF ONE TIME MONIES THERE I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO ONGOING FUNDING. WE PREFER THAT MOST OF OUR ON GOING FUNDING GOES -- TO MORE OF THAT THE CORE MISSION -- FOCUSED ELEMENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY. ENROLLMENT GRAD INITIATIVE COMPENSATION THOSE SORTS OF THINGS. ALL RIGHT SO -- FORGIVE ME IF I MISSED THIS BUT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT ONE TIME FUNDING YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE THOSE THOSE DOLLARS -- BEING INTENDED TO EXPAND THE PARTNERSHIPS TO ME WHAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WHEN THOSE ONE TIME FUNDS RUN OUT. SO THE REASON WE WANT TO CONNECT WITH -- AGENCIES IN THE COMMUNITY THAT HAVE A TRADITION OF WORKING WITH THESE TYPES OF POPULATIONS IS SO THAT. THEY'RE USED TO RECEIVING ONE TIME DOLLARS AND MAKING THEM STRETCH AND THEY USUALLY THEY'LL HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S ALREADY -- WORKING IN THIS AREA THAT HAS EXPERTISE IN REACHING OUT -- THE ISSUE WITH ONE TIME FINDING IS THAT OUR CAMPUSES ARE NOT I'M PRONE TO HIRE ON FOLKS TO HELP WITH THIS. YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE FUNDING RUNS OUT THEY'RE NOT YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT POSITION SO WHAT WE'RE HOPING IS THAT BY FINDING THESE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLETO CONTINUE THIS PARTNERSHIP BEYOND THE DOLLARS. I'M AND THEN WORK WITH OUR CAMPUSES TO EITHER GO AFTER ADDITIONAL GRANT FUNDING -- EXTERNALLY OR LOOK FOR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUNDING IN THE FUTURE OKAY SO THIS WOULD BE KIND OF LIKE. TO KICK START SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS. AND AND AND THAT SEEMS LIKE A VERY -- EFFICIENT -- WAY OF STRETCHING THE IMPACT OF OF OF STATE DOLLARS -- SO IT -- THE THE LA -- MENTION TO OR AS SUGGESTED SOME METRICS -- FOR EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS A ONE TIME -- DOLLARS WHAT WOULD BE THE BASIC PARAMETERS OF THE METRICS YOU BE LOOKING. I'D DEFINITELY LOOKING AT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT ARE BEING SERVED BY THESE ORGANIZATIONS -- WITH THE FOLLOW FOLLOW UP IS. I'M ALSO LOOKING AT SOME ACADEMIC SUCCESS INDICATORS AND CROSS REFERENCING KNOWS AND LOOKING AT THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THOSE AND SOME OF THESE. ACT BOB OUT OF CLASSROOM SUPPORT -- I THINK REALLY TRYING TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT MORE CHALLENGING -- SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW BEST TO SHOW THE IMPACT OF THESE PROGRAMS ON SOME OF THOSE INTERRED INDICATORS. I GUESS ADD. TO YOUR ACCOUNT FOR USING CORPORATION IT INTO. A REGULAR SURVEY THE DAY CONDUCT FOR STUDENTS QUESTIONS PERTAINING -- TO HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS AND SO THAT THAT'S GOING TO GIVE THEM THE ABILITY OVER TIME TO SEE IF. THINGS ARE CHANGING GETTING BETTER FOR STUDENTS WHAT WHAT THE IMPACT IS SET SOMETHING TO CONSIDER FOR CSU THEY SAY MENTIONED THEY DID A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY -- THROUGHOUT TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN I KNOW SEE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO MORE. OF THE SAME AND AND SOMETHING -- MORE SURVEYS LIKE THAT NOT THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. NOT JUST FOR FOR CSU BUT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THESE DOLLARS [inaudible] OKAY. IN AND THEN YOU KNOW LIKE I HAVE A A GENERAL QUESTION I WE WE'VE BEEN. SPENDING A LOT OF TIME IN THIS -- SUBCOMMITTEE TALKING ABOUT -- YOU KNOW HOW THE IN THE HOUSING AND AND AND FOOD AND SECURITY ISSUES THAT HAVE BECOME YOU KNOW. DRAMATICALLY -- MUCH MORE PROMINENT -- AND AND AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW SO MUCH OF THAT IS IS [inaudible] DRIVEN BY. THE THE OVERALL COST OF HOUSING THE OVERALL COST OF LIVING ESPECIALLY IN OUR OUR CAMPUS IS LOCATED IN OUR OUR COASTAL AREAS. HOW DO I -- HOW DO YOU RESPOND -- TO TO YOU KNOW. MY MY CONSTITUENTS THAT TALK ABOUT -- YOU KNOW. BACK IN BACK IN THEIR DAY WHEN THEY WHEN THEY ATTEND COLLEGE YOU KNOW THEY IS THEY THEY THEY WERE THEY WERE THEY WERE JUST HAPPY TO TO HAVE SOME OF THE TUITION COVERED THAT -- YOU KNOW THAT NOW YOU CAN NOW THE STATE -- IS IS GETTING INTO -- AND AND TO PROVIDE A MORE HOUSING AND FOOD ASSISTANCE. IT WILL WHAT WHAT HAS CHANGED -- TO IN IN IT YOU KNOW FOR FROM THESE PREVIOUS GENERATIONS. WHY -- I MEAN I WOULD SAY THAT THAT THE OUR CAMPUSES ARE MICROCOSM OF LARGER SOCIETY. AND THAT -- AS COSTS HAVE RISEN THEY HAVEN'T JUST WITHIN FOR OUTSIDE OF THE CAMPUS THEY'VE WRITTEN FOR STUDENTS THAT ARE ON CAMPUS AS WELL. ADD AS MUCH AS WE ARE PROVIDING SUPPORTS THOSE ACADEMIC SUPPORTS OUR STUDENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT OUT OF CLASSROOM SUPPORTS AS WELL -- IT AND YOU KNOW AS AS WE SEE THAT OUR STUDENT POPULATION INVOLVING WE TO HAVE TO A FAULT -- WITH THE TYPES OF SUPPORTS THAT WORKS FOR PROVIDING STUDENTS SO I JUST THINK YOU KNOW THE COST OF LIVING THE COSTS OF ATTENDING SCHOOL OF THE COST ALL OF THAT HAS. GONE UP NO WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. STAD -- TAKE. YOUR ANTENNAE SO. ON TO SOMETHING YOU TALKED ABOUT THE STUDENTS FROM FROM DECADES AGO IT. IT IS DIFFERENT TO IN TERMS OF STUDENTS WHO ATTENDED FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS DECADES AGO VERSUS TODAY WHICH IS A GOOD THING YOU HAVE -- MORE -- ACCESS -- AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS FROM LOWER INCOMES -- SO LACK THERE COULD BE SOMETHING THERE. ANOTHER SOMETHING INTERESTING OF FROM MY MENTIONED UC CONDUCTS A SURVEYS OF THEIR STUDENTS AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT. ONE QUARTER OF STUDENTS WHO SAID THERE. CAME FROM FAMILIES EARNING A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE. EXPERIENCED SOME FOOD AND SECURITY SO QUARTER AND AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S SOMEWHAT OF A PUZZLE. FOR US IS SOMETHING WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND BETTER IS IT THE THE FACT THAT IN CALIFORNIA HAVE HIGH HOUSING HOUSING COSTS A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST DOESN'T. GO AS FAR AS AS IT DOES ELSEWHERE MAYBE THE PARENTS AREN'T ABLE TO HELP THE STUDENTS WITH THE EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION. COULD BE AN ISSUE OF OF UNUSUALLY HIGH COSTS FOR CERTAIN STUDENTS AS WELL YOU KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE THEY HAVE UNIQUE CONDITIONS SO THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S SOME LOT OF THINGS DONE PACKED THERE AND AND AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND BETTER. TO GET IT KIND OF THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM ESPECIALLY FOR STUDENTS AGAIN FROM HIGHER INCOME MORE AFFLUENT FAMILIES THAT HER REPORTING THEY'RE HAVING TROUBLE AS WELL. AND TO SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY -- ANY ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT WHY WHY THE MIDDLE AND AND AND HIGHER INCOME -- STUDENTS ARE ALSO WE DID NOT ON OUR LAST COMPREHENSIVE STUDY WE DID NOT ASK THAT QUESTION SPECIFICALLY BUT WE ANECDOTALLY FROM OUR VISITS TO THE FOOD PANTRY. THE FOLKS THAT ARE WORKING THERE ARE THING MORE MINUTE. STUDENTS THAT COME FROM TRADITIONALLY MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES THAT ARE ACCESSING SERVICES. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MOVING ON THEN TO ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN PROJECT REBOUND. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON GOING GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT PROJECT REBOUND WHICH IS AN EXISTING PROGRAM OFFERED AT NINE CSU CAMPUSES. TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SEEKING ADMISSION TO THE UNIVERSITY OR ARE CURRENTLY ATTENDING ONE OF US PARTICIPATING CSU CAMPUSES. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT HELLO THOUGH THERE IS LIMITED DATA BASED ON A RECENT SURVEY OF CAMPUSES BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE GRADUATES OF PROJECT REBOUND APPEAR TO HAVE. STRONG ACADEMIC AND EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES AND GIVEN THE STATE'S INTEREST IN REHABILITATING OFFENDERS THE LEGISLATURE MAY AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR THAT SERVING THIS GROUP OF STUDENTS IS A HIGH PRIORITY. IF SO -- THOUGH THE AMOUNT PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON GOING IS IS QUITE SMALL REALISTICALLY IT'S ONLY ENOUGH TO FIND. A COUPLE OF STAFF AND SO RATHER THAN PROVIDE THIS AMOUNT THE LEGISLATURE COULD ENCOURAGE CSU TO LEVERAGE A MUCH LARGER POT OF MONEY -- THAT FUNDS RECEIVED FROM THE STATE THROUGH THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE IN USING GRADUATION INITIATIVE FUNDS FOR FORMALLY INCARCERATED STUDENTS WOULD BE ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH CAMPUSES CURRENT PRACTICES OF USING THESE MONIES. TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES TO OTHER AT RISK STUDENTS SUCH AS FORMER FOSTER YOUTH UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS AND OTHER STUDENTS WITH HIS FROM HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED BACKGROUNDS. WITH US RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE ENCOURAGE CSU TO PLACE A HIGH PRIORITY ON USING GRADUATION INITIATIVE FUNDS TO SUPPORT PROJECT REBOUND THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE. HEARING ABOUT SOME ONE TIME GRANTS THAT ARE ABOUT TO EXPIRE -- SO THE TIMING IS IS IMPORTANT AND A LEGISLATURE -- MAY ALSO WANT TO BEGIN REQUIRING THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO REPORT REGULARLY ON PROJECT REBOUND ON INFORMATION SUCH AS IN ROMANCE STUDENT OUTCOMES IN SCHOOL AS WELL AS ABILITY TO GET A JOB AND AND STAY OUT OF STAY OUT OF PRISON OR JAIL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YES YEAH. A GOOD MORNING -- MISTER CHAIRMAN OUR HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DOCTOR BRADY HEINER -- I'M A PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY -- AND THE FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF PROJECT REBOUND AT CAL STATE UNIVERSITY FULLER. TEN I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE CAL STATE UNIVERSITY PROJECT REBOUND CONSORTIUM -- SO I ADDRESS YOU TODAY AS A REPRESENTATIVE -- FOR NINE CAMPUS PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE NEW SEVEN MINISTRATION FOR INCLUDING AN ONGOING ALLOCATION FOR PROJECT REBOUND IN THE COMING YEARS BUDGET. I ALSO WISH TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THIS GROUP. COMMITTEE FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT OUR WORK -- AND WHY WHILE -- VERY HELPFUL THE ADMINISTRATION'S ALLOCATION FALLS SHORT OF THE SUPPORT NEEDED TO SUSTAIN AND TO SCALE ARE ARE PROVEN MODEL OF SUCCESS -- THE MISSION A PROJECT REBOUND IS TO SUPPORT THE HIGHER EDUCATION AND SUCCESSFUL REINTEGRATION OF FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE. THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR PHILOSOPHY IS THAT THE LEADERSHIP AND MENTORSHIP OF OTHER FORMERLY INCARCERATED UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND GRADUATES. FOSTERS A SENSE OF BELONGING AND ACHIEVEMENT AMONG FORMALLY INCARCERATED STUDENTS THAT MAXIMIZES THEIR CHANCES OF SUCCESS. THIS IS WHY WE STAFF OUR ON CAMPUS PROGRAMS WITH TRAINED PROFESSIONALS WHO LIKE OUR STUDENTS HAVE EXPERIENCED INCARCERATION. AND WHO EXEMPLIFY THE SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION TOWARD WHICH OUR STUDENTS ASPIRE. PROJECT REBOUND WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY BY SOCIOLOGY PROFESSOR JOHN -- WHEN? AFTER SERVING FIVE YEARS IN STATE PRISON FOR ARMED ROBBERY -- WHEN EARNED A BACHELOR'S DEGREE FROM UCLA A PHD FROM UC BERKELEY AND ESTABLISH PROJECT REBOUND AS A PATHWAY TO MATRICULATE THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED INTO THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY? OVER TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PROJECT REBOUND STUDENTS EARNED A BACHELOR'S OR MASTER'S DEGREE FROM SAN FRANCISCO STATE BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE AND TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN THROUGH THE OPPORTUNITY INSTITUTES RENEWING AND COMMUNITIES INITIATIVE. NINE CSU CAMPUSES CLLABORATED TO PILOT THE PROJECT REBOUND CONSORTIUM MODELED AFTER THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE. THE PROJECT REBOUND CONSORTIUM CURRENTLY INCLUDES PROGRAMS AT CAMPUSES IN BAKERSFIELD FRESNO FULLER TEN LOS ANGELES POMONA SACRAMENTO SAN BERNARDINO SAN DIEGO AND SAN FRANCISCO. THESE PROGRAMS NOW PROVIDE A STATEWIDE NETWORK OF SUPPORT FOR FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS TO ASSIST THEM TO ESTABLISH EDUCATIONAL PLANS APPLY FOR ADMISSION AND FINANCIAL AID. SOCIALLY REINTEGRATE AND ULTIMATELY GRADUATE FROM THE CSU. MOST OF ALL PROJECT REBOUND OFFERS A COMMUNITY OF SUPPORT TO STUDENTS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THE TRAUMAS OF PRISON AND NOW FACE A MULTITUDE OF SOCIAL BARRIERS RELATED TO HOUSING. EMPLOYMENT TRANSPORTATION FOOD AND COMPUTER LITERACY BARRIERS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DERAIL THEIR LIVES AND LEAD TO RE ARREST. OUR PROGRAMS WORK. THE STUDENTS IN OUR PROGRAMS DO NOT RETURN TO PRISON. AFTER THREE YEARS OF OPERATION THE PROJECT REBOUND CONSORTIUM HAS IS 0% RECIDIVISM RATE. BY COMPARISON THE THREE YEAR RECIDIVISM RATE IN CALIFORNIA IS BUT RECIDIVISM IS JUST A MINIMAL METRIC OF OUR STUDENT SUCCESS OUR STUDENTS NOT ONLY DESIST FROM CRIME. THEY NOT ONLY PERSISTENT SCHOOL THEY EXCEL. PROJECT REBOUND REDUCES ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AMONG STUDENTS FROM HISTORICALLY UNDER SERVED AND EDUCATIONALLY DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS. OUR STUDENTS 60% OF WHOM ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN OR LATINO. HAVE EARNED AN OVERALL GRADE POINT AVERAGE OF THREE POINT NO NEARLY EVERY SEMESTER. AT CAL STATE FULLERTON TO ADDRESS THE HIGH RATES OF HOUSING AND SECURITY AMONG OUR RE ENTERING STUDENTS. PROJECT REBOUND HAS PILOTED THE FIRST REENTRY HOUSING INITIATIVE FOR FORMERLY INCARCERATED UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN THE NATION. AND AMONG OUR STUDENTS WHO RECEIVE HOUSING SUPPORT THE OVERALL GRADE POINT AVERAGE IS THREE POINT. SEVEN THROUGHOUT THE CONSORTIUM PROJECT REBOUND STUDENTS HAVE SECURED SCHOLARSHIPS VOLUNTEERED FOR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND LANDED INTERNSHIPS AND JOBS IN THEIR FIELDS. BY THE END OF NEXT MONTH THE PROJECT REBOUND CONSORTIUM WILL HAVE GRADUATED OVER TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS IN JUST THREE YEARS. DURING WHICH TIME THE ENROLLMENT IN OUR PROGRAMS HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED. 87% OF PROJECT REBOUND GRADUATES SECURE EMPLOYMENT OR ENROLLED IN POST GRADUATE PROGRAMS. IN CONCLUSION LET ME SAY THAT NOW IS THE CRITICAL TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO INVEST IN PROJECT REBOUND. IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR THE PHILANTHROPIC SEED GRANT THAT FUNDS THE GENERAL OPERATION OF OUR PROGRAMS WILL CONCLUDE. A HANDFUL OF OUR PROGRAMS WILL BE FORCED TO SHUT THEIR DOORS IN THE ABSENCE OF ALTERNATIVE LONGITUDINALLY SUSTAINABLE FORMS OF SUPPORT. GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S ALLOCATION WHILE HELPFUL STILL FALLS SIGNIFICANTLY SHORT OF THE SUPPORT NEEDED TO SUSTAIN WHAT WE'VE BUILT. AND MEET INCREASING DEMAND. MISTER CHAIRMAN HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WE ASK FOR YOUR INCREASED SUPPORT TO ENABLE US TO SUSTAIN AND SCALE ARE PROVEN MODEL OF SUCCESS. TO BUILD SAFER COMMUNITIES AND A STRONGER ECONOMY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU THAT. TO THOSE ARE -- IMPRESSIVE NUMBERS AND I AM -- YOU KNOW I A I THINK THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT -- SHOULD BE. A FURTHER HIGHLIGHTED AND AND AND SHARED AS A SUCCESS STORY -- I WANTED -- TO JUST SAYS SOME -- BASIC QUESTIONS SO -- ART. DID YOU HAVE NUMBERS IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW THE THE IT WITH THE V. ENROLLED -- STUDENTS AND AND PROJECT REBOUND A YOU KNOW WHETHER THEY HAVE -- FELONY CONVICTIONS OR MISDEMEANOR CONVICTIONS ADMITTED THAT THE NATURE OF THE GRAVITY OF THEIR THEIR PRIOR OFFENSES -- SO -- TO THIS POINT WE HAVEN'T HAD THE FUNDING TO TO CONDUCT ROBUST. ASSESSMENT PROGRAM EVALUATION -- BUT WE DO KNOW -- THAT THE STUDENTS IN OUR PROGRAM. RANGE IN TERMS OF CONVICTION HISTORIES FROM -- HAVING SERVICE A FEW WEEKS IN COUNTY JAIL TO SERVING TWENTY THREE YEARS IN STATE PRISON OKAY. AND WE WE HAVE NO. NON ACADEMIC SCREENING CRITERIA -- FOR THE ADMISSION SINCE OUR PROGRAM ALL RIGHT [inaudible] BUT MAIN [inaudible] GAIL. AND HAVING. TO WORKED AS A PROSECUTOR MY PREVIOUS LIFE I MEAN I I KNOW THAT INCARCERATION CAN BE AND ANYTHING FROM. SPENDING AYE -- IN A FEW NIGHTS IN JAIL FOR DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL. TO OBVIOUSLY MUCH MORE SERIOUS CRIMES BUT DID YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY. ANY -- YOU KNOW FURTHER -- YEAH I DATA TO TO GIVE ME A GREATER SENSE OF APPRECIATION FOR THE THE STUDENT POPULATION THERE SIR. WELL I CAN TELL YOU A BIT ABOUT THE DEMOGRAPHICS -- OF OUR STUDENT POPULATION -- SO 25% ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN 35% -- ARE LATINO. WE HAVE -- AT CAL STATE FULLERTON -- WE'VE -- ASKED STUDENTS -- FURTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT ABOUT THEIR STATUS -- AND AS IS ANNA GO TO GO EAT I THINK REPRESENTATIVE ACROSS THE THE CONSORTIUM -- ABOUT 60% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS -- 40% OF OUR STUDENTS HAVE CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN I I WILL SAY THAT -- WELL I DON'T HAVE DATA -- TO TELL YOU ABOUT -- BREAKDOWNS OF CONDITION HISTORIES -- I WILL SAY THAT -- THE PRESENCE AND PARTICIPATION OF STUDENTS -- WHO? WERE FORMER LIFERS -- WHO DO WHO DO WHO DO DID A LOT OF TIME HAS BEEN? REALLY SENSUAL -- THOSE ARE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY WHO REALLY SERVE AS THE GLUE -- AND OFTEN TAKE ON ROLES WITH SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS OF YET ROLES OF MENTORSHIP WHICH IS REALLY AT THE CENTER OF OUR OUR PHILOSOPHY CREATING OF A MENTORSHIP FEEDBACK LOOP -- WHERE -- FORMALLY INCARCERATED -- STUDENTS AND GRADUATES WHO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION CAN CAN IN TURN AROUND -- AND SUPPORT FOLKS -- COMING OUT AND HELP FOLKS NAVIGATE THE THE THE CSU -- WHICH AS AS YOU WELL KNOW CSU CAMPUSES THERE'S OUR SMALL CITIES -- AND SEE IF YOU CLASSROOMS ARE MICROCOSM RIGHT -- OF OF OF THE CIVIC MAFIC MICROCOSM THAN THEIR THEIR SPACES -- WHERE OUR STUDENTS CAN -- ROOM REALLY BEGIN TO RIP SOCIALLY REINTEGRATE -- SO -- BUT WHY DON'T HAVE DATA WHAT THE THE INCREASE REQUEST -- THAT WERE MAKING WOULD INCLUDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US -- TO TO TO CONDUCT A ROBUST ASSESSMENT. OKAY YEAH I AGAIN. I WAS LIKE A GREAT PROGRAM I I JUST THINK THAT TO TO FURTHER HIGHLIGHTING SHOWCASE THE PROGRAM MAYBE IT WOULD BE -- YOU'D BE GOOD TO GET A BETTER SENSE AS TO THE THE THE THE THE THE THE THE NATURE -- OF THAT THE PRIOR CRIMINAL HISTORY OF OF THE THE STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO THAT ASSESSMENT THANK YOU. SO THERE ARE MORE TO CHEAT YOU OUT I ASKED IF I WANTED. TO SAY ANYTHING YES HI PASSED BEFORE BY LIKE TO JUMP ANNOUNCEMENT COULD -- SO ONE ONE THING THAT -- HAVE TO STIPULATE THIS IS A FANTASTIC PROGRAM RIGHT TO IT TO SEE PEOPLE TURN THEIR LIVES AROUND IS A FANTASTIC ACHIEVEMENT AND KUDOS TO ALL OF OUR FOLKS WHO RUN PROJECT REBOUND. I THINK THE ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND -- WHEN IT COMES DOWN -- TO FUNDING THE UNIVERSITY IS THAT -- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PRESSURES AND THERE'S A LOT OF NEED OUT THERE RIGHT PROJECT REBOUND IS ONE OF MANY GREAT PROGRAMS IS PROGRAMS FOR VETS AND DREAMERS AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER. SUBGROUPS. THE THE THE THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE IS A SYSTEM IS IS IF WE END UP HAVING A SITUATION WHERE THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR DECIDE -- TO ADD ADDITIONAL SPECIAL PREPARATIONS FOR CERTAIN THINGS. THAT DOES CIRCUMVENT THE PRIORITIES THAT THE PRESIDENT'S% AND THE LEADERS OF THE CAMPUSES HAVE ALREADY ESTABLISHED. CERTAINLY LET'S TALK ABOUT PROJECT REBOUND AS AN EXAMPLE.

HAVE IMPACTS ON MENTAL HEALTH. AT SOME OF THE STATE WE HAVE A LARGE PROBLEM HOMELESS STUDENTS. WE'VE GOT LOTS OF STUDENTS LIVING IN THEIR CARS I JUST AS AN EXAMPLE ONE OF MY STUDENTS FAIL TO GRADUATE ON TIME BECAUSE HE LOST HIS HOUSING HE WAS LIVING IN HIS CAR WHILE TRYING O COMPLETE HIS DEGREE IN HIS LAST SEMESTER.

AND ON OUR OUR CAMPUS WE WORK AS HARD AS WE CAN BUT IT'S VERY CHALLENGING AND SO I THINK OF A REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT SEEING SOME IMPROVEMENT IN GRADUATION RATES WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT. ISSUES LIKE HOMELESSNESS FOOD AND SECURITY AMONG OUR STUDENTS ALSO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH IMPACTS AND ONE OF THE BEST WAYS THAT WE CAN IMPROVE OUR GRADUATION RATE. IS BY MAKING SURE THAT WE PROVIDE THE MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL SUPPORT THAT OUR STUDENTS NEED IN ADDITION TO THE TO THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL. THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING KEVIN WARE PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY AT SACRAMENTO STATE AND SECRETARY OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION.

AFTER I PUT AWAY THE BOX OF TISSUES THAT WE BOTH NEEDED -- I A REFERRED THEM TO THE COUNSELING CENTER TO GET ASSISTANCE WHERE THEY WERE EACH TOLD THAT AN APPOINTMENT WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN FOUR WEEKS.

WHOEVER WOULD LIKE TO SEE SPECIFICALLY IS THAT THE GROWTH BE MEASURED BY HEAD COUNT AND SET OF FD EITHER AT THE EQUIVALENTS TO ENSURE THAT THE FUNDING A SPENT TO INCREASE ACCESS TO EDUCATION RATHER THAN INCREASE THE UNITS FIRST IN -- THERE'S A COUPLE SPECIFIC REASONS WHY WE MAKE THIS REQUEST THE FIRST BEING THAT LAST YEAR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM TURNED AWAY OVER THIRTY THOUSAND QUALIFIED STUDENTS -- THE FUNDING WILL ENSURE MORE QUALIFIED STUDENTS TO GET TO SEE THE CSU WHEN IT'S MEASURE MY HEAD COUNT SAID AT THE EASE -- THE GOVERNOR ALSO PROPOSED A SIXTY TWO MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE FOR ENROLLMENT THESE FUNDS THE CSU COULD PERRY. FOR SEVEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AT THE STUDENTS OR EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE STUDENTS BY HEAD COUNT -- AND BY THE SO MEASURE OF USING ATTY CALCULATIONS WHICH ARE BASED ON HOW MANY UNITS STUDENTS TAKE THIS YES YOU CAN USE OUR OWN PLANS TO GET CURRENT STUDENTS TO TAKE MORE CLASSES INSTEAD OF GIVING STUDENTS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE TURNED AWAY SEE THAT THE CSU. WHICH THE CSU IS DOING FOR THIS CURRENT BUDGET YEAR -- AND PERSONALLY I THINK. THERE ARE OTHER MORE APPROPRIATE WAYS TO FIND -- IN ROOM INCREASE IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN INCREASE IN UNITS FOR TUITION -- PARTICULARLY THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE FUNDING AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE CSU SYSTEM LOOK AT ITS MISSION IN INCREASING ACCESS FOR NONTRADITIONAL COLLEGE STUDENTS PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT HAVE FAMILIES ARE COMING IN A LATER AGE. THAT WOULD BE LIKELY TO TAKE LESS UNITS AND WOULD BE DISCOUNTED BY USING AN INCREASE ENROLLMENT BY FTP MEASUREMENTS THE SET OF HEAD COUNTS THANK YOU.

AS WE REPEATEDLY POINTED OUT USING THE CSU MANAGEMENT'S OWN DATA THEY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT POOL OF FULLY QUALIFIED. OF FACULTY AMONG OUR LECTURERS THOSE ARE FACULTY WHO ARE ONE TEMPORARY OF CONTRACTS.
