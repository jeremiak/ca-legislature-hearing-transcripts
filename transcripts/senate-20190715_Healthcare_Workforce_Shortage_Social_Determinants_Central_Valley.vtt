UNIVERSITY THAT EDUCATED

00:18:05.083 --> 00:18:07.085
STUDENTS AND WE REALIZE HOW

00:18:07.152 --> 00:18:09.087
IMPORTANT IT WAS TO HAVE THE

00:18:09.154 --> 00:18:10.789
UNIVERSITY IN THEIR BACKYARDS.

00:18:10.856 --> 00:18:12.991

YOUNG PEOPLE HERE IN FRESNO AS

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.095
WELL KNEW THAT THAT UNIVERSITY

00:18:17.162 --> 00:18:19.231
WAS BUILT FOR THEM AND THAT WE

00:18:19.298 --> 00:18:22.768
HAD DREAMS AND EXPECTATIONS.

00:18:22.835 --> 00:18:23.402
THAT THEY WOULD DO WELL IN THAT

00:18:23.469 --> 00:18:25.070
THEY WOULD DO SUCCESSFUL AND OUR

00:18:25.137 --> 00:18:26.972
GOAL AT THAT TIME WAS TO BRING

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:29.074
THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE SHE IS C.

00:18:29.141 --> 00:18:30.876
MERCED WITH THE IDEA THAT.

00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:32.744
THAT THAT SCHOOL WOULD PARTNER

00:18:32.811 --> 00:18:36.748
WITH CSU FRESNO AND UC DAVIS

00:18:36.815 --> 00:18:37.316

YEARS AT UC DAVIS.

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:42.955
AND THEN THE STUDENTS WOULD THEN

00:18:43.021 --> 00:18:44.756
DO THEIR INTERNSHIPS AND

00:18:44.823 --> 00:18:46.959

IN OUR HEALTH CLINICS AND

00:18:53.031 --> 00:18:54.800
HOSPITALS?

00:18:54.867 --> 00:18:55.434
WITH THE IDEA THAT THEY WOULD

00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:57.169
THEN STAY HERE BECAUSE WE KNOW

00:18:57.236 --> 00:18:58.971
THAT FOR YEARS WE HAVE HAD

00:18:59.037 --> 00:19:00.772

OF MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS NOT

00:19:21.226 --> 00:19:23.328
AND EIGHT WITH THE HOUSING

00:19:23.395 --> 00:19:25.063
SHORTAGE BUT THINGS HAVE

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:27.099
RETURNED TO NORMAL.

00:19:27.165 --> 00:19:29.201
WE HAVE SEEN THE STATE IN A MUCH

00:19:29.268 --> 00:19:31.203
BETTER STATE THAN WE EVER HAVE

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.038

THE LEGISLATURE.

00:19:33.505 --> 00:19:35.173
AND SO NOW IS THE RIGHT TIME TO

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:39.011
RE FOCUS OUR ENERGIES AGAIN TO

00:19:39.077 --> 00:19:39.511

THE CARE OF OUR FAMILIES AND IT

00:26:45.303 --> 00:26:47.339

00:35:18.182 --> 00:35:20.151
CALIFORNIA AND IN THE VALLEY I'M

00:35:20.218 --> 00:35:22.119
GONNA FOCUS ON PRIMARY CARE AND

00:35:22.186 --> 00:35:23.788
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BECAUSE I

00:35:23.855 --> 00:35:24.355
BELIEVE OUR RESEARCH WHICH

00:35:24.422 --> 00:35:25.890
SUGGESTS THAT THESE ARE. TO THE

00:35:25.957 --> 00:35:27.758
AREAS WHERE WE HAVE THE GREATEST

00:35:27.825 --> 00:35:29.760
CHALLENGES WE CERTAINLY HAVE

00:35:29.827 --> 00:35:30.394
CHALLENGES EVERY AREAS BUT THESE

00:35:30.461 --> 00:35:35.766
ARE TWO OF THE GREATEST SO WHEN

00:35:35.833 --> 00:35:36.400
THE INTEREST OF TIME WILL FOCUS

00:35:36.467 --> 00:35:38.336
THEIR OUR SERVER FIVE KEY POINTS

00:35:38.402 --> 00:35:40.137
ON THE CHALLENGES WE FACE FIRST

00:35:40.204 --> 00:35:40.738
OUR PRIMARY CARE IN BEHAVIOR

00:35:40.805 --> 00:35:41.806
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS.

00:35:41.873 --> 00:35:43.841
ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED EVENLY

00:35:43.908 --> 00:35:44.275
ACROSS THE STATE THE

00:35:44.342 --> 00:35:45.843
DISTRIBUTION IS QUITE POOR AND

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:46.444
I'LL SHOW YOU A COUPLE SLIDES

00:35:46.511 --> 00:35:47.879
ABOUT THAT.

00:35:47.945 --> 00:35:49.847
A SECOND SOME PRIMARY KERR

00:35:49.914 --> 00:35:50.515
BEHAVIOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS DO

00:35:50.581 --> 00:35:52.250
NOT ACCEPT MEDICAID PATIENTS WE

00:35:52.316 --> 00:35:54.185
CERTAINLY HOPE THAT THAT IS

00:35:54.252 --> 00:35:56.087
CHANGING AS THE STATE HAS

00:35:56.153 --> 00:35:56.654
INCREASED MEDIC COW RATES.

00:35:56.721 --> 00:35:58.322
BUT IT IS A PARTICULAR CONCERN

00:35:58.389 --> 00:36:00.291
IN PLACES LIKE THE VALLEY WHERE

00:36:00.358 --> 00:36:01.959
A LARGE PART OF OUR POPULATION

00:36:02.026 --> 00:36:04.262
IS IN POVERTY AND ON MEDICARE

00:36:04.328 --> 00:36:08.099
NOW -- SECONDLY A THIRD MANY

00:36:08.165 --> 00:36:08.666
PRIMARY KERR BEHAVIOR HEALTH

00:36:08.733 --> 00:36:10.167
PROFESSIONALS IN CALIFORNIA ARE

00:36:10.234 --> 00:36:13.871
AT OR NEAR RETIREMENT AGE --

00:36:13.938 --> 00:36:14.472
WHICH MEANS WE NEED TO THINK

00:36:14.539 --> 00:36:15.072
VERY SERIOUSLY ABOUT HOW WE'RE

00:36:15.139 --> 00:36:18.042
GOING TO REPLACE THEM AND THE

00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:18.576
FORECASTS THAT I AND MY

00:36:18.643 --> 00:36:20.077
COLLEAGUES AT UCSF HAVE DONE.

00:36:20.144 --> 00:36:22.413
SUGGEST THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.148
INSUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF NEW

00:36:24.215 --> 00:36:26.117
PRIMARY CARE AND BEHAVIORAL

00:36:26.183 --> 00:36:28.052
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO REPLACE

00:36:28.119 --> 00:36:29.854
THOSE WHO RETIRE AND LESS THE

00:36:29.921 --> 00:36:32.223
STATE AXE PROACTIVELY. TO EXPAND

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:33.958
THEIR NUMBERS AND INDEED I THINK

00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:34.659
THE BUDGET FOR THIS YEAR MADE A

00:36:34.725 --> 00:36:36.427
GOOD DOWN PAYMENT ON THAT

00:36:36.494 --> 00:36:37.962
INVESTMENT BUT THERE'S STILL

00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:38.262
MORE TO DO.

00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:40.131
AND THEN FINALLY PRIMARY CARE

00:36:40.197 --> 00:36:41.966
AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS

00:36:42.033 --> 00:36:42.600
ARE NOT AS RACIALLY ETHNICALLY

00:36:42.667 --> 00:36:44.201
AND LINGUISTICALLY DIVERSE AS

00:36:44.268 --> 00:36:46.003
CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION.

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:48.339
THEY DO NOT LOOK LIKE CALIFORNIA.

00:36:48.406 --> 00:36:52.043
AND AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY

00:36:52.109 --> 00:36:54.011
LOOK MORE LIKE CALIFORNIA.

00:36:54.078 --> 00:36:56.380
OKAY SO JUST A FEW -- GRAPHS

00:36:56.447 --> 00:36:56.981
HERE LOOKING AT THE STATE OF

00:36:57.048 --> 00:36:58.182
CALIFORNIA AND THE MAJOR REGIONS

00:36:58.249 --> 00:37:00.117
OF THE STATE -- AND THESE ARE

00:37:00.184 --> 00:37:02.086
ACTIVE PATIENT CARE PRIMARY CARE

00:37:02.153 --> 00:37:04.355
PHYSICIANS PER HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:37:04.422 --> 00:37:06.023
POPULATION NOW WHY DO WE DO A

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:06.591
RATIO PER HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:37:06.657 --> 00:37:08.359
POPULATION WELL THAT ENABLES US

00:37:08.426 --> 00:37:09.961
TO MAKE MEANINGFUL COMPARISONS

00:37:10.027 --> 00:37:10.628
ACROSS REGIONS OF WE JUST LOOKED

00:37:10.695 --> 00:37:12.063
AT RAW NUMBERS.

00:37:12.129 --> 00:37:13.965
WE SEE THAT LA HAS MORE PRIMARY

00:37:14.031 --> 00:37:15.967
CARE PHYSICIANS WELL LOS ANGELES

00:37:16.033 --> 00:37:18.169
HAS MORE PEOPLE MORE FREEWAYS.

00:37:18.235 --> 00:37:20.071
MORE CARS PROBABLY MORE

00:37:20.137 --> 00:37:22.373
STARBUCKS THAN ANY PLACE AND IN

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.275
CALIFORNIA AND SO THAT JUST

00:37:24.342 --> 00:37:24.942
DOESN'T HELP WAS PUTTING HIM ON

00:37:25.009 --> 00:37:28.346
A HUNT PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:37:28.412 --> 00:37:28.546
SCALE.

00:37:28.613 --> 00:37:29.113
MAKES MEANINGFUL COMP --

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.348
COMPARISONS AND SO WHAT WE SEE

00:37:30.414 --> 00:37:30.548
HERE.

00:37:30.615 --> 00:37:34.085
CALIFORNIA OVERALL HAS FIFTY

00:37:34.151 --> 00:37:34.619
SEVEN ACTIVE PRIMARY CARE

00:37:34.685 --> 00:37:36.354
PHYSICIANS PER HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.322
POPULATION IN THE SAN JOAQUIN

00:37:38.389 --> 00:37:42.326
VALLEY ONLY FORTY FIVE SO WE'RE

00:37:42.393 --> 00:37:42.727
BEHIND THE STATE.

00:37:42.793 --> 00:37:44.228
AND THEN IF WE LOOK HERE AT

00:37:44.295 --> 00:37:46.163
PSYCHIATRY THE SITUATION IS EVEN

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:48.332
MORE BLEAK CALIFORNIA OVERALL

00:37:48.399 --> 00:37:52.003
HAS FIFTEEN PSYCHIATRIST PER

00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.603
HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION.

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:54.405
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY HAS ONLY

00:37:54.472 --> 00:37:58.009
SEVEN LESS THAN HALF.

00:37:58.075 --> 00:38:00.144
OF MOVING TO MEDIC COW THIS

00:38:00.211 --> 00:38:02.179
GRAPH PERCENTS.

00:38:02.246 --> 00:38:04.281
SOME WORK THAT -- OUR I

00:38:04.348 --> 00:38:06.217
COLLEAGUES AND I DID FOR THE

00:38:06.283 --> 00:38:08.052
CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION --

00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:10.121
IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND L. WE

00:38:10.187 --> 00:38:12.123
CONDUCTED A SURVEY IN

00:38:12.189 --> 00:38:12.723
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE MEDICAL

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:14.458
BOARD AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT

00:38:14.525 --> 00:38:16.093
AT THAT TIME 64%.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.997
OF PHYSICIANS IN CALIFORNIA HAD

00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:20.665
ANY MEDIC HOW PATIENTS IN THEIR

00:38:20.731 --> 00:38:22.400
PRACTICE SO THIS ISN'T WERE THEY

00:38:22.466 --> 00:38:24.368
WILLING TO ACCEPT NEW OR NOT

00:38:24.435 --> 00:38:26.003
THIS DID THEY HAD EVEN ANY

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:26.270
EXISTING.

00:38:26.337 --> 00:38:28.305
MEDIC HOW PATIENTS IN THEIR

00:38:28.372 --> 00:38:30.207
PRACTICE AND ONLY 64% DID SO

00:38:30.274 --> 00:38:34.078
AGAIN -- THIS IS A CONCERN FOR

00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:35.980
AREAS OF THE STATE WITH A HIGH

00:38:36.047 --> 00:38:38.082
PROPORTION THE POPULATION MEDIC

00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:38.716
HAL AND WE'RE CERTAINLY HOPEFUL

00:38:38.783 --> 00:38:40.418
I THAT THE INCREASES IN MEDICAL

00:38:40.484 --> 00:38:42.386
PAYMENT WILL RESULT IN MORE

00:38:42.453 --> 00:38:44.388
DOCTORS SERVING MEDI CAL

00:38:44.455 --> 00:38:46.190
PATIENTS.

00:38:46.257 --> 00:38:48.459
I'M RACE ETHNICITY HERE

00:38:48.526 --> 00:38:49.026
APPLAUDED DATA FROM TWENTY

00:38:49.093 --> 00:38:52.129
FIFTEEN ON RECENT GRADUATES OF

00:38:52.196 --> 00:38:52.797
M. D. D. O. THAT'S OSTEOPATHIC

00:38:52.863 --> 00:38:54.031
PHYSICIAN.

00:38:54.098 --> 00:38:56.100
PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT NURSE

00:38:56.167 --> 00:38:56.600
PRACTITIONER AND ARE IN

00:38:56.667 --> 00:38:58.235
EDUCATION PROGRAMS BY RACE

00:38:58.302 --> 00:39:00.404
ETHNICITY AND AGAIN WHAT WE SEE

00:39:00.471 --> 00:39:02.006
THEY DO NOT MATCH THE POPULATION

00:39:02.073 --> 00:39:02.540
I GOT THE POPULATION OF

00:39:02.606 --> 00:39:04.375
CALIFORNIA OVER ON THE RIGHT.

00:39:04.442 --> 00:39:06.444
AND SO THOSE ARE THE PERCENTAGES

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:08.312
OF AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS AND

00:39:08.379 --> 00:39:10.414
NATIVE AMERICANS IN THE

00:39:10.481 --> 00:39:12.483
POPULATION AND WE LOOK OVER AT

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:16.187
THESE -- FIVE PROFESSIONS THERE

00:39:16.253 --> 00:39:16.387
ARE.

00:39:16.454 --> 00:39:18.422
THERE'S UNDER REPRESENTATION FOR

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:20.357
ALL NOW CURIOUSLY IF WE LOOK AT

00:39:20.424 --> 00:39:22.259
SOME OTHER FIELDS THAT ARE

00:39:22.326 --> 00:39:22.793
IMPORTANT FOR JACQUELINE

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.261
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND EVEN

00:39:24.328 --> 00:39:26.130
PRIMARY CARE WOULD BE SOCIAL.

00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:26.764
SOCIAL WORKERS HAVE GREAT ROLES

00:39:26.831 --> 00:39:28.499
TO PLAY IN COUNSELING AND

00:39:28.566 --> 00:39:29.133
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND THEY CAN

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.634
ALSO BE VALUABLE IN PRIMARY CARE

00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:32.236
IN HELPING FOLKS.

00:39:32.303 --> 00:39:34.205
GET THE FULL RANGE OF OF

00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:36.173
SERVICES THEY NEED TO BE AS

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.109
HEALTHY AS THEY CAN TO ADDRESS

00:39:38.175 --> 00:39:38.776
THEIR SOCIAL NEEDS AS WELL AS A

00:39:38.843 --> 00:39:40.478
MEDICAL AND THAT'S A FIELD WHERE

00:39:40.544 --> 00:39:42.413
FOR LATINOS IN AND FOR OTHER

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.080
CHRISTMAS SPECIAL FOR LATINOS WE

00:39:43.147 --> 00:39:44.381
SEE A MUCH HIGHER REPRESENTATION

00:39:44.448 --> 00:39:46.150
SO I THINK ONE OF OUR QUESTIONS.

00:39:46.217 --> 00:39:48.185
ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES IS HOW CAN

00:39:48.252 --> 00:39:48.753
WE GET THESE MORE CLINICAL

00:39:48.819 --> 00:39:50.221
PROFESSIONS TO LOOK MORE LIKE

00:39:50.287 --> 00:39:50.554
SOCIAL WORK.

00:39:50.621 --> 00:39:52.323
OKAY TWO MINUTES I'VE GOT A

00:39:52.389 --> 00:39:54.291
SPEEDED UP.

00:39:54.358 --> 00:39:56.227
I'M SO JUST THIS SLIDE I WON'T

00:39:56.293 --> 00:39:56.827
GO INTO DEPTH WITH THIS IS A

00:39:56.894 --> 00:39:58.562
TYPOLOGY OF DIFFERENT STRATEGIES

00:39:58.629 --> 00:40:00.397
FOR ADDRESSING HEALTH WORKFORCE

00:40:00.464 --> 00:40:02.299
NEEDS TO SORT OF YOU CAN KIND OF

00:40:02.366 --> 00:40:02.967
THINK ABOUT OF A WAY TO KIND OF

00:40:03.033 --> 00:40:04.368
CATEGORIZE THE DIFFERENT.

00:40:04.435 --> 00:40:06.470
STRATEGIES YOU MIGHT PURSUE SO

00:40:06.537 --> 00:40:08.105
FIRST IS ENHANCED THE PIPELINE

00:40:08.172 --> 00:40:10.174
GROW THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO

00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:10.808
ARE PURSUING HEALTH PROFESSIONS

00:40:10.875 --> 00:40:12.376
EDUCATION AND FOCUS ON IN

00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:14.145
RECRUITING.

00:40:14.211 --> 00:40:16.113
THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:16.714
INTERESTED MOST PASSION ABOUT

00:40:16.781 --> 00:40:20.217
SERVING UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS

00:40:20.284 --> 00:40:22.153
AND PREPARE THEM TO DO THAT.

00:40:22.219 --> 00:40:22.787
UP RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF

00:40:22.853 --> 00:40:24.522
PROGRAMS OF THINGS LIKE LONGER

00:40:24.588 --> 00:40:26.123
PAYMENT STRATEGIES TO TAKE OUR

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:28.192
PHYSICIANS NURSES OTHERS WHO

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:28.759
WERE RICHARD COMING OUT OF

00:40:28.826 --> 00:40:30.294
TRAINING AND GET THEM TO

00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:30.895
PRACTICE IN THE PARTS OF THE

00:40:30.961 --> 00:40:32.263
STATE WHERE THEY'RE MOST NEEDED

00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:32.763
GET THEM TO THE CARE.

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:34.265
FOR CARE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:40:34.331 --> 00:40:36.200
MOST IN NEED OF MAXIMIZING THE

00:40:36.267 --> 00:40:38.335
EXISTING REPORTS TAKING STEP

00:40:38.402 --> 00:40:38.936
BACK AND SAY MORE WE USE THE

00:40:39.003 --> 00:40:40.137
EXISTING WORKFORCE.

00:40:40.204 --> 00:40:42.106
MORE EFFICIENTLY MORE

00:40:42.173 --> 00:40:42.740
EFFECTIVELY WE CERTAINLY HAVE

00:40:42.807 --> 00:40:44.341
HEARD SEVERAL PEOPLE TODAY

00:40:44.408 --> 00:40:46.310
MENTION CHROMODORIS AND THAT'S

00:40:46.377 --> 00:40:48.345
DEFINITELY ONE TYPE OF A HEALTH

00:40:48.412 --> 00:40:50.481
WORKER THAT WE COULD EXECUTE

00:40:50.548 --> 00:40:52.583
UTILIZE MORE EXTENSIVELY --

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:54.552
FINALLY LEVERAGING DATA I MEAN

00:40:54.618 --> 00:40:56.387
THIS IS ADMITTEDLY A LITTLE SELF

00:40:56.453 --> 00:40:58.222
SERVING I'M AN ACADEMIC BUT I

00:40:58.289 --> 00:41:00.157
WANT TO SAY IT'S NOT JUST THAT.

00:41:00.224 --> 00:41:02.293
IS THAT WE REALLY DON'T HAVE THE

00:41:02.359 --> 00:41:02.893
DATA SYSTEMS IN PLACE IN OUR

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:06.430
STATE. TO ENABLE -- THE SELECT

00:41:06.497 --> 00:41:08.399
COMMITTEE AND AND THE SECRETARY

00:41:08.465 --> 00:41:10.267
AND OTHERS TO MAKE THE BEST

00:41:10.334 --> 00:41:12.203
DECISIONS ABOUT INVESTMENTS IN

00:41:12.269 --> 00:41:14.271
THE HEALTH WORKFORCE AND OUR

00:41:14.338 --> 00:41:16.140
GROUP AT UCSF WILL HAVE A PAPER

00:41:16.207 --> 00:41:16.807
COMING OUT IN A FEW WEEKS LAYING

00:41:16.874 --> 00:41:18.375
OUT WHAT WE SEE IS AN IDEAL

00:41:18.442 --> 00:41:20.244
SYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIA.

00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:20.845
I'M I'M NOT GONNA TALK MUCH

00:41:20.911 --> 00:41:22.513
ABOUT THE STATE BUDGET ITEMS

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:24.215
BECAUSE OTHERS HAVE DONE THAT

00:41:24.281 --> 00:41:24.882
BUT TO SAY THAT THEY ARE A GOOD

00:41:24.949 --> 00:41:26.150
A DOWN PAYMENT.

00:41:26.217 --> 00:41:28.552
AND THEN SOME RECOMMENDATIONS OF

00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:28.953
WHERE WE MIGHT.

00:41:29.019 --> 00:41:30.654
GO BEYOND THIS IN TERMS OF X.

00:41:30.721 --> 00:41:32.356
THE EXISTING WORKFORCE THERE'S

00:41:32.423 --> 00:41:34.425
LEGISLATION PENDING BEFORE THE

00:41:34.491 --> 00:41:34.959
LEGISLATURE TO GIVE NURSE

00:41:35.025 --> 00:41:36.493
PRACTITIONERS FOR PRACTICE.

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.662
A STORY THIS CERTAINLY ISN'T THE

00:41:38.729 --> 00:41:40.397
ONLY THING WE COULD DO BUT IT IS

00:41:40.464 --> 00:41:41.031
ONE THING THAT TAKES LEGISLATIVE

00:41:41.098 --> 00:41:42.266
ACTION.

00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:44.568
MOST STATES NURSE PRACTITIONERS

00:41:44.635 --> 00:41:46.437
CAN BRIBE CAN PRACTICE.

00:41:46.503 --> 00:41:48.439
WITHOUT SUPERVISION AND THERE'S

00:41:48.505 --> 00:41:50.541
VERY STRONG ROBUST BODY OF

00:41:50.608 --> 00:41:54.345
EVIDENCE THAT THEY CAN DO THIS

00:41:54.411 --> 00:41:56.280
SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY.

00:41:56.347 --> 00:42:00.384
AND WILL STOP THERE AND OR DO

00:42:00.451 --> 00:42:02.419
YOU ONLY CAN [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:02.486 --> 00:42:02.620
OKAY.

00:42:02.686 --> 00:42:04.355
OKAY WELL WELL WELL.

00:42:04.421 --> 00:42:06.290
WILL STOP THEIR OWNERS PRACTICES

00:42:06.357 --> 00:42:06.857
SAFELY EFFECTIVELY AND THOSE

00:42:06.924 --> 00:42:08.492
STATES THAT HAVE FULL PRACTICE

00:42:08.559 --> 00:42:10.527
OF FORTY TEND YOU'RE MORE FOLKS

00:42:10.594 --> 00:42:12.263
ARE ENTERING THE FIELD.

00:42:12.329 --> 00:42:12.897
AND THERE'S BETTER ACCESS TO

00:42:12.963 --> 00:42:14.465
CARE SO THE LAST THREE REALLY

00:42:14.531 --> 00:42:16.300
QUICKLY INCREASE FUNDING FOR

00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:16.901
PSYCHIATRY RESIDENCY PROGRAMS

00:42:16.967 --> 00:42:18.435
AND PSYCHIATRIC NURSE

00:42:18.502 --> 00:42:19.069
PRACTITIONER EDUCATION PROGRAMS

00:42:19.136 --> 00:42:20.771
THERE CERTAINLY SOME MONEY FOR

00:42:20.838 --> 00:42:22.339
THIS IN THE BUDGET BUT IT'S NOT

00:42:22.406 --> 00:42:22.940
ON THE SCALE OF THE INVESTMENT

00:42:23.007 --> 00:42:24.475
IN PRIMARY CARE.

00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:25.109
SO I REALLY THINK WHEN WE LOOK

00:42:25.175 --> 00:42:28.345
AT THE SCALE OF THE NEED AND

00:42:28.412 --> 00:42:29.013
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THERE'S A NEED

00:42:29.079 --> 00:42:30.447
FOR MORE INVESTMENT THEIR

00:42:30.514 --> 00:42:32.516
RELATIVE TO PRIMARY CARE --

00:42:32.583 --> 00:42:34.685
PROVIDING FUNDS FOR TARGET

00:42:34.752 --> 00:42:35.219
INCREASES IN A MOMENT A

00:42:35.286 --> 00:42:38.856
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA MEDICAL

00:42:38.923 --> 00:42:39.123
SCHOOLS.

00:42:39.189 --> 00:42:40.858
OF THE FORTY FIVE TO THE FORTY

00:42:40.925 --> 00:42:41.525
FIVE STATES HAVE MEDICAL SCHOOLS

00:42:41.592 --> 00:42:42.893
ARE FEW THE SMALL STICK JUST

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:43.527
DON'T HAVE A FORTY FIVE STATES

00:42:43.594 --> 00:42:44.461
HAVE MEDICAL SCHOOLS.

00:42:44.528 --> 00:42:46.463
CALIFORNIA RANKS FORTY THIRD.

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:48.666
FORTY THIRD IN THE RATIO OF

00:42:48.732 --> 00:42:50.701
MEDICAL STUDENTS TO POPULATION.

00:42:50.768 --> 00:42:52.836
SO OUR YOUNG CALIFORNIANS WHO

00:42:52.903 --> 00:42:54.538
ARE INTEREST IN BECOMING

00:42:54.605 --> 00:42:56.540
PHYSICIANS HAVE FAR FEWER

00:42:56.607 --> 00:42:57.074
OPPORTUNITIES THAN THEIR

00:42:57.141 --> 00:42:58.842
COUNTERPARTS IN MOST OTHER

00:42:58.909 --> 00:43:00.577
STATES.

00:43:00.644 --> 00:43:02.780
OF AND I WOULD COME INTO THE

00:43:02.846 --> 00:43:03.447
REPORT OF THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE

00:43:03.514 --> 00:43:05.015
HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION THAT

00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:06.884
HAS. SIX SEPARATE

00:43:06.951 --> 00:43:08.819
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STRATEGIES

00:43:08.886 --> 00:43:10.621
THAT COULD BE PURSUED TO

00:43:10.688 --> 00:43:12.589
INCREASE.

00:43:12.656 --> 00:43:14.892
ENROLLMENT AND USE THE MEDICAL

00:43:14.959 --> 00:43:16.593
SCHOOL SO I THINK.

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:17.161
THOSE ARE ALL WORTH TAKING A

00:43:17.227 --> 00:43:18.896
LOOK AT AND THEN LASTLY

00:43:18.963 --> 00:43:20.764
INVESTING IN THE HEALTH

00:43:20.831 --> 00:43:21.432
PROFESSIONS EDUCATION PIPELINE.

00:43:21.498 --> 00:43:23.000
WE ARE GOING TO GET THE HEALTH

00:43:23.067 --> 00:43:24.735
WORKFORCE TO LOOK MORE LIKE

00:43:24.802 --> 00:43:26.804
CALIFORNIA UNLESS WE INVEST IN

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:28.739
THE PIPELINE AND I WOULD

00:43:28.806 --> 00:43:29.373
ENCOURAGE IS PARTICULARLY TO

00:43:32.609 --> 00:43:32.776

THESE ARE OUR YOUNG LATINO ALL

MY REMARKS ARE FOCUSED ON MY

DOING WHAT I'M DOING AS WAS

00:44:59.229 --> 00:45:01.265
MENTIONED I DOES COME FROM I DO

00:45:01.331 --> 00:45:03.133
COME FROM AN IMMIGRANT FAMILY --

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.135
AND I WAS A FARM WORKER -- FOR

00:45:05.202 --> 00:45:07.071
THE FOR SIXTEEN YEARS OF MY LIFE

00:45:07.137 --> 00:45:08.906
SO I'VE LIVED.

00:45:08.972 --> 00:45:10.874
WHAT MANY OF MY PATIENTS AND

00:45:10.941 --> 00:45:11.575
MANY OF THE MANY OF THE STUDENTS

00:45:11.642 --> 00:45:13.177
THAT I WORK WITH HAVE LIVED

00:45:13.243 --> 00:45:15.012
THROUGH AND CONTINUE TO LOOK

00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:16.980
THROUGH AS IMMIGRANT TOM?

00:45:17.047 --> 00:45:17.247
FAMILIES.

00:45:17.314 --> 00:45:19.249
HAVING THAT EXPERIENCE --

00:45:19.316 --> 00:45:20.918
INEVITABLY.

00:45:20.984 --> 00:45:23.220
WE FACED MANY INEQUITIES IN

00:45:23.287 --> 00:45:25.222
HEALTHCARE -- I SAW WITHIN MY

00:45:25.289 --> 00:45:28.892
OWN PERSONAL FAMILY -- TRAGEDIES

00:45:28.959 --> 00:45:29.493
THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.128
HAD WE NOT LIVED IN LABOR CAMPS

00:45:31.195 --> 00:45:32.963
HAD WE NOT LIVED IN CARS HAVE

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.497
BEEN NOT LIVED IN TENTS.

00:45:33.564 --> 00:45:37.201
ON THINGS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN --

00:45:37.267 --> 00:45:39.203
HANDLED BETTER BY THE HEALTHCARE

00:45:39.269 --> 00:45:41.205
PROFESSIONALS THAT TOOK CARE OF

00:45:41.271 --> 00:45:43.073
MY FAMILY HAD THEY RECOGNIZED

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:45.142
UNDERSTOOD WHERE WE CAME FROM

00:45:45.209 --> 00:45:47.144
WHAT OUR RESOURCES WERE AND THEY

00:45:47.211 --> 00:45:49.079
WOULD HAVE OFFERED OTHER TYPES

00:45:49.146 --> 00:45:51.248
OF REMEDIES IF YOU WILL -- AND

00:45:51.315 --> 00:45:53.350
SO THAT'S WHAT DROVE ME INTO

00:45:53.417 --> 00:45:54.918
HEALTHCARE.

00:45:54.985 --> 00:45:55.586
I BECAME A FAMILY PHYSICIAN IN

00:45:55.652 --> 00:45:57.254
PARTICULAR BECAUSE I WANTED TO

00:45:57.321 --> 00:45:59.022
PROVIDE.

00:45:59.089 --> 00:46:00.991
PRIMARY CARE FOR THE ENTIRE

00:46:01.058 --> 00:46:03.060
FAMILY BUT BEYOND THE FAMILY THE

00:46:03.127 --> 00:46:05.062
COMMUNITY TAKING CARE OF A ONE

00:46:05.129 --> 00:46:07.064
PERSON IS IMPORTANT TAKING CARE

00:46:07.131 --> 00:46:07.698
OF THE FAMILY IS IMPORTANT BUT

00:46:07.764 --> 00:46:09.133
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS TAKING

00:46:09.199 --> 00:46:09.666
CARE OF THE COMMUNITY AND

00:46:09.733 --> 00:46:11.168
UNDERSTAND THE COMMUNITY FROM

00:46:11.235 --> 00:46:13.103
WHERE THEY COME FROM -- I THEN

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:15.272
BECAME A FACULTY MEMBER AT THE

00:46:15.339 --> 00:46:16.974
SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND THE

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:19.009
REASON FOR THAT WAS BECAUSE

00:46:19.076 --> 00:46:21.311
HAVING GONE TO MEDICAL SCHOOL

00:46:21.378 --> 00:46:23.046
AND NOT HAVING ANY MENTORS AND

00:46:23.113 --> 00:46:25.215
ROLE MODELS -- IT WAS A CUTE FOR

00:46:25.282 --> 00:46:27.518
ME TO GIVE BACK TO THE YOUNG

00:46:27.584 --> 00:46:29.286
PEOPLE -- TO HELP THEM NOT

00:46:29.353 --> 00:46:31.255
STRUGGLE THE WAY THAT I

00:46:31.321 --> 00:46:32.990
STRUGGLED AS I WENT THROUGH

00:46:33.056 --> 00:46:33.624
UNDERGRAD AND THEN COLLEGE --

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:35.359

00:46:37.261 --> 00:46:39.062
TRAINING.

00:46:39.129 --> 00:46:41.331
SO BECAUSE OF THAT -- BACKGROUND --

WE FOUNDED THE A DOCTOR'S

00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:45.369

IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

00:47:09.693 --> 00:47:13.063
ON THE IDEA WAS TO GROW OUR OWN --

WE WORK TO DEVELOP A COLLEGE

ACROSS OUR NETWORK -- SOME

00:52:27.878 --> 00:52:29.913
PLACES MORE THAN OTHERS AND IN

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.948

AND WE REALLY FOUND THAT AND FOR

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:55.739
DISCIPLINARY TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT

00:52:55.805 --> 00:52:57.908
REALLY MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE.

00:52:57.974 --> 00:52:59.543
THAT DOESN'T EVEN INCLUDE THE

00:53:07.784 --> 00:53:11.488
HOW BUILDING A WORK FORCE IS A

00:53:11.555 --> 00:53:12.188
DIRE NEED THAT REQUIRES CONSTANT

00:53:12.255 --> 00:53:13.490
TENDING?

00:53:13.557 --> 00:53:15.926
BASED ON THE LITERATURE AND WHAT

OTHERS HAVE ALREADY SAID WE WANT

00:53:17.694 --> 00:53:19.696

00:53:19.763 --> 00:53:21.631
GOING TO LOOK LIKE OUR

00:53:21.698 --> 00:53:23.466

SCHOOLS THAT MATCH OUR

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:33.877
POPULATION. ONE EXAMPLES LATINO

00:53:33.944 --> 00:53:35.812
POPULATION WORDS ABOUT 60% IN

00:53:35.879 --> 00:53:39.716
OUR AREA BUT ONLY ABOUT 15% OF

00:53:39.783 --> 00:53:41.718
OUR RESIDENTS CURRENTLY AREN'T

00:53:41.785 --> 00:53:43.620
FORTINO DESCENT.

00:53:43.687 --> 00:53:45.889
WHAT THE WAY WE TRIED -- TO

00:53:45.956 --> 00:53:47.991
ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM IS BY.

00:53:48.058 --> 00:53:49.893
EMPHASIZING TO OUR RESIDENTS

00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:51.661
EVEN BEFORE THEY ARRIVE HOW

00:53:51.728 --> 00:53:53.797
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IS GOING TO

00:53:53.863 --> 00:53:55.632
BE A PRIORITY FOR US.

00:53:56.299 --> 00:53:57.901
SELECTION PROCESS AND I WILL

00:53:57.968 --> 00:53:59.769
TELL YOU IT DOES IN FACT HOW

EASY IT IS TO RECRUIT PEOPLE

THERE AREN'T A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO

00:54:03.707 --> 00:54:05.809
ARE REALIZING -- HOW WONDERFUL

00:54:05.875 --> 00:54:07.677
IT IS TO DO THIS WHAT WE FOUND

00:54:07.744 --> 00:54:08.211
IS THAT OUR RESIDENTS ARE

00:54:08.278 --> 00:54:09.846

WORKING WITH THE PREMATURE US

00:54:34.571 --> 00:54:35.839
INTO DERA HAS CREATED A

00:54:35.905 --> 00:54:37.607
COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER PROGRAM

00:54:37.674 --> 00:54:39.609
TO ADDRESS OBESITY PROBLEM.

00:54:39.676 --> 00:54:40.143
FIND COULD PROVING HEALTH

THEMSELVES -- HEALTHY NUTRITIOUS

00:54:53.757 --> 00:54:55.725
AND INEXPENSIVE MEALS.

00:54:55.792 --> 00:54:57.794
AND WE HAVE ANOTHER GROUP THAT

00:54:57.861 --> 00:54:59.929
PUT ON A SYMPOSIUM FOR ABOUT THE

00:54:59.996 --> 00:55:01.698
MEDICAL PROVIDERS AND OTHER

00:55:01.765 --> 00:55:02.232
PROVIDERS FOR CHILDREN.

00:55:02.298 --> 00:55:04.034
IN THE ADOLESCENT INJURIES TO

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:05.869
DISCUSS SOCIAL REPRINT ARE SORRY

00:55:05.935 --> 00:55:07.904
SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH

00:55:07.971 --> 00:55:09.773
SO THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF

00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:10.407
HOW WE ARE ALREADY CONNECTING

00:55:10.473 --> 00:55:12.175
THIS COMMUNITY AND WE PLAN TO

00:55:12.242 --> 00:55:15.745
CONTINUE -- WE ALREADY HAVE

00:55:15.812 --> 00:55:16.312
ANOTHER CLASS STARTING THEIR

00:55:16.379 --> 00:55:17.747
PROGRAMS.

00:55:17.814 --> 00:55:18.381
I JUST BRAG ABOUT MY RESIDENCE

00:55:18.448 --> 00:55:20.183
BECAUSE I REALLY DO THINK THAT

00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:21.951
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT FAR

00:55:22.018 --> 00:55:23.586
RESIDENCY PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE

00:55:23.653 --> 00:55:23.953
VERY IMPORTANT.

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:25.889
TOTALLY AGREE THAT THE FROM A

00:55:25.955 --> 00:55:27.957
TAURUS IS GONNA BE A BIG ASSET

00:55:28.024 --> 00:55:29.926
AND I WANT OUR RESIDENTS TO

00:55:29.993 --> 00:55:33.730
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM.

00:55:33.797 --> 00:55:35.865
I'M GOING TO TELL THE STORY GIVE

00:55:35.932 --> 00:55:36.533
HER A LOT OF INFORMATION I JUST

00:55:36.599 --> 00:55:38.034
WANT TO TELL THE STORY BECAUSE I

00:55:38.101 --> 00:55:39.903
AM A PEDIATRIC GI DOCTOR ABOUT A

00:55:39.969 --> 00:55:41.738
YOUNG PERSON.

00:55:41.805 --> 00:55:42.138
TEENAGER WHO HAD.

00:55:42.205 --> 00:55:43.907
D. I. BLEEDING FOR SEVERAL

00:55:43.973 --> 00:55:45.909
MONTHS BY THE TIME SHE ARRIVED

00:55:45.975 --> 00:55:46.376
TO THE CLINIC VISIT.

00:55:46.443 --> 00:55:48.111
HER LACK OF ACCESS TO CARE

00:55:48.178 --> 00:55:50.013
REALLY RESULTED IN AN ESCALATION

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:52.148
OF HER CARE SHE WAS HOSPITALIZED

00:55:52.215 --> 00:55:53.983
FOR MANY WEEKS BECAUSE OF IT

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:55.852
EVEN THOUGH WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE

00:55:55.919 --> 00:55:56.453
THE DIAGNOSIS VERY QUICKLY.

00:55:56.519 --> 00:55:58.254
AND THEN WHEN SHE WAS DISCHARGED

00:55:58.321 --> 00:56:00.056
THE INSURANCE PLAN DID NOT ALLOW

00:56:00.123 --> 00:56:01.758
HER TO GET HER MEDICATION SHE

00:56:01.825 --> 00:56:03.727
WAS BACK IN THE HOSPITAL.

00:56:03.793 --> 00:56:05.762
THIS JUST SHOWS AGAIN HOW

00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:06.429
IMPORTANT ACCESS TO CARE IS BUT

00:56:06.496 --> 00:56:11.801
ALSO -- I THINK DR DALLY.

00:56:11.868 --> 00:56:13.937
MADE A POIGNANT -- POINT TO SAY

00:56:14.003 --> 00:56:14.571
THAT THE SENATE THE THE MENTAL

00:56:14.637 --> 00:56:16.172
HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF THE

00:56:16.239 --> 00:56:17.741
FULL FAMILY WAS AFFECTED.

00:56:17.807 --> 00:56:18.408
AND LOT OF TIMES WE DON'T EVEN

00:56:18.475 --> 00:56:19.909
KNOW ABOUT THE MEDICAL

00:56:19.976 --> 00:56:22.011
CONDITIONS UNTIL WE FIND ONE OF

00:56:22.078 --> 00:56:23.713
THE PARENTS HAS PASSED WAVE

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:24.414
OTHER TITLES IN THE HOSPITAL AND

00:56:24.481 --> 00:56:25.815
THIS IS NOT.

00:56:25.882 --> 00:56:30.153
THIS IS NOT JUST AN OCCASIONAL

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:31.755
OCCURRENCE.

00:56:31.821 --> 00:56:32.422
I ALSO WANT TO TELL THAT STORY

00:56:32.489 --> 00:56:34.057
BECAUSE COMPLEX CARE IS ALSO

00:56:34.124 --> 00:56:35.825
VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE VALLEY

00:56:35.892 --> 00:56:36.326
IT'S EASY FOR ME AS A

00:56:36.392 --> 00:56:38.161
PEDIATRICIAN TO EMPHASIZE THAT

00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:38.728
AND I TAKE CARE OF A LOT OF

00:56:38.795 --> 00:56:40.196
CHILDREN WITH COMPLEX NEEDS.

00:56:40.263 --> 00:56:42.065
BUT WE CAN'T FORGET ABOUT THEM.

00:56:42.132 --> 00:56:44.200
I ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE

00:56:44.267 --> 00:56:46.136
WANT THE BEST DOCTORS.

00:56:46.202 --> 00:56:48.238
WE WANT THE ONES THAT ARE GOING

00:56:48.304 --> 00:56:49.906
TO THE BEST INSTITUTIONS AND I

00:56:49.973 --> 00:56:51.975
KNOW FROM MY INSTITUTION WE HAVE

00:56:52.041 --> 00:56:54.110
WORKED VERY HARD TO RECRUIT DOES

00:56:54.177 --> 00:56:56.279
BEST DOCTORS BUT IT TAKES A LOT

00:56:56.346 --> 00:56:57.847
OF TIME.

00:56:57.914 --> 00:57:00.250
SO WE CAN GROW THEM FROM OUR OWN

00:57:00.316 --> 00:57:02.185
THAT'S IDEAL -- WE DON'T HAVE A

00:57:02.252 --> 00:57:05.822
MEDICAL SCHOOL HERE YET BUT

00:57:05.889 --> 00:57:07.891
THERE WILL EVEN BE BETTER --

00:57:07.957 --> 00:57:08.424
WHEN I SAY THE BEST THESE

00:57:08.491 --> 00:57:10.026
DOCTORS ARE TRAINING FOR MINIMUM

00:57:10.093 --> 00:57:12.061
SIX YEARS FOR PEDIATRIC

00:57:12.128 --> 00:57:13.997
SPECIALTIES AND FOR THE SURGEONS

00:57:14.063 --> 00:57:15.865
SINCE? SIX TO TEN YEARS.

00:57:15.932 --> 00:57:16.366
WE HAVE DOCTORS AT OUR

00:57:16.432 --> 00:57:18.101
INSTITUTION THAT ARE ALSO

00:57:18.168 --> 00:57:20.203
INVOLVED IN THE COMMUNITY AS

00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:23.940
WELL AS THEY ARE -- MENTORING

00:57:24.007 --> 00:57:25.909
STUDENTS ALONG THE WAY MENTORING

00:57:25.975 --> 00:57:28.044
RESIDENCE AND I REALLY HAVE TO

00:57:28.111 --> 00:57:28.745
EMPHASIZE WHAT I'VE SEEN IS THAT

00:57:28.812 --> 00:57:30.346
THIS COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND

00:57:30.413 --> 00:57:32.348
THIS WORK FORCE THAT'S WORKING

00:57:32.415 --> 00:57:32.615
TOGETHER.

00:57:32.682 --> 00:57:34.384
IS WHAT WILL BE OUR BEST BET FOR

00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:36.219
RETENTION EVEN WHILE WE'RE

00:57:36.286 --> 00:57:38.054
TRYING TO GET DOCTORS MONEY I

00:57:38.121 --> 00:57:38.721
KNOW PEOPLE THINK WE ALWAYS WANT

00:57:38.788 --> 00:57:40.323
MONEY BUT ACTUALLY WHAT I'VE

00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:42.225
SEEN AND I CAN SPEAK TO IT FROM

00:57:42.292 --> 00:57:44.227
THE MILITARY WHEN I WAS IN THE

00:57:44.294 --> 00:57:44.627
MILITARY TO NOW.

00:57:44.694 --> 00:57:47.931
THAT IS NOT WHAT KEEPS DOCTORS

00:57:47.997 --> 00:57:49.966
DOING WHAT THEY DO EVERY DAY.

00:57:50.033 --> 00:57:51.968
SO MY ASSESSMENT.

00:57:52.035 --> 00:57:54.003
IN CONCLUSION WE NEED TO

00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:55.939
CONTINUE TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN

00:57:56.005 --> 00:57:57.941
INTELLIGENT AND DRIVEN PEDIATRIC

00:57:58.007 --> 00:57:58.474
WORKFORCE PROVIDERS THAT

00:57:58.541 --> 00:58:00.143
REPRESENT THE DIVERSE

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:02.312
COMMUNITIES OF OUR GREAT CENTRAL

00:58:02.378 --> 00:58:02.545
VALLEY.

00:58:02.612 --> 00:58:04.380
WE NEED MORE PIPELINE PROGRAMS

00:58:04.447 --> 00:58:06.216
TO ATTRACT AND SUPPORT THE

00:58:06.282 --> 00:58:08.051
UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS MANY OF

00:58:08.117 --> 00:58:10.320
THEM -- ARE ASKING FOR SIMPLE

00:58:10.386 --> 00:58:12.188
THINGS LIKE MENTORSHIP FOR

TAKING A BOARD EXAM IF YOU DON'T

INTO MEDICAL SCHOOL AND THE

00:58:16.392 --> 00:58:18.228
LINGUISTIC AND CULTURAL --

00:58:18.294 --> 00:58:20.230
BARRIERS ARE PRETTY SEVERE IN

00:58:20.296 --> 00:58:24.100
THE VALLEY. FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS

00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:24.701
WE NEED TO WE NEED CREATIVE

00:58:24.767 --> 00:58:26.402

00:58:34.577 --> 00:58:36.479

00:58:36.546 --> 00:58:38.281
DUE TO OUR CONCERNS A WORK LIFE

00:58:38.348 --> 00:58:40.283
BALANCE AND SALARIES SOMETIMES

00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:42.051

PHYSICIANS IN ADDITION TO

VALLEY TO STAY.

00:58:50.159 --> 00:58:52.262
I SUPPORT THAT WE SHOULD

00:58:52.328 --> 00:58:54.097

IF PEOPLE LIKE DR FLOORS HAD NOT

TALK ABOUT GROWING OUR OWN.

OF MY SENATOR HERE. TO FIGURE

01:00:48.544 --> 01:00:50.246
OUT IF THERE'S A BUDGETARY ASK

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:52.382
WE CAN DO TO HELP TO SUPPORT

01:00:52.448 --> 01:00:54.217
THOSE PATHWAY PROGRAMS.

01:00:54.283 --> 01:00:56.285
THAT ARE LOOKING AT DOCTORS

01:00:56.352 --> 01:00:58.254

01:01:12.235 --> 01:01:14.303
OPPORTUNITIES TO STUDENTS WHO GO

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:16.205
TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

01:01:16.272 --> 01:01:16.739
BECAUSE AS WE TALK ABOUT

01:01:16.806 --> 01:01:18.541
DIVERSITY WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

01:01:18.608 --> 01:01:20.610
WHERE STUDENTS WHO ARE BLACK AND

01:01:20.676 --> 01:01:22.412

01:01:22.478 --> 01:01:24.414
AND A LOT OF THEM ARE GOING TO

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:24.981
OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND

01:01:25.048 --> 01:01:26.516
PROVIDING THOSE PATHWAY

01:01:26.582 --> 01:01:28.618
OPPORTUNITIES WILL HELP US TO

01:01:28.684 --> 01:01:30.653
DIVERSIFY OUR WORK FORCE GOING

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.321
FORWARD.

01:01:32.388 --> 01:01:34.424
SO I REALLY JUST WANTED. TO PUT

01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:35.024
A PIN IN THAT AND SEE IF WE

01:01:35.091 --> 01:01:38.361
COULD FOLLOW UP WITH STAFF. TO

01:01:38.428 --> 01:01:40.296
MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE PUTTING A

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:42.331
BUDGET ASK IN FRONT OF THE UP

01:01:42.398 --> 01:01:44.333
ADMINISTRATION TO LOOK AT FOR

THE UPCOMING YEAR TO FIGURE OUT

01:01:46.569 --> 01:01:47.036
HOW WE COULD CONTINUE TO

01:01:47.103 --> 01:01:48.304
DIVERSIFY.

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:50.606
BUT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT COULD

01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:52.308
DOCTOR LEMOND ABOUT NOT HAVING A

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:52.942
MEDICAL SCHOOL YET BECAUSE IT'S

01:01:53.009 --> 01:01:54.310
COMING.

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:56.345
AND FOR THOSE OF YOU IN THE

01:01:56.412 --> 01:01:58.281
AUDIENCE WHO DON'T KNOW WE'VE

01:01:58.347 --> 01:02:00.316
WORKED HARD TO TRY TO BRING A

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:00.883
MEDICAL SCHOOL BACK TO THE

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:02.318
VALLEY.

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:04.554
AND THIS SEPTEMBER WE WILL HAVE

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.489
OUR FIRST COHORT OF STUDENTS

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:08.591
STARTING AT UCSF WHO WILL BE

01:02:08.658 --> 01:02:10.326
TRAINED UP THERE.

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:12.662
BUT CALM DOWN TO THE VALLEY

01:02:12.728 --> 01:02:14.464
AFTER THEIR FIRST EIGHTEEN

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:16.365
MONTHS TO DO THE REMAINDER OF

01:02:16.432 --> 01:02:16.966
THEIR MEDICAL SCHOOL HERE IN

01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:20.503
FRESNO.

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:22.305
THAT PATHWAY THAT ABILITY TEST.

01:02:22.371 --> 01:02:26.375
HAVE THEM SEE OUR PATIENTS WHEN

01:02:26.442 --> 01:02:28.411
THEY ARE MEDICAL STUDENTS.

01:02:28.478 --> 01:02:30.613
OFTENTIMES INSPIRES THEM TO WANT

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.448
TO WORK WITH THAT PATIENT

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:33.082
POPULATION FOR BOTH RESIDENCIES

01:02:33.149 --> 01:02:36.419
IN THEIR LIFE.

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:37.019
I KNOW I MADE A DIFFERENCE FOR

01:02:37.086 --> 01:02:38.421
ME.

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:40.423
WANTING TO PRACTICE IN A

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:41.023
COMMUNITY LIKE THE ONE THAT I

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:42.425
KEEP.

01:02:42.492 --> 01:02:44.727
BUT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT A

01:02:44.794 --> 01:02:46.429
LITTLE BIT IF I COULD.

01:02:46.496 --> 01:02:48.631
THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR PRIME

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:50.433
PROGRAMS.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.568
WHICH OFTENTIMES HAVE NOT BEEN

01:02:52.635 --> 01:02:54.437
SUPPORTED FOLEY.

01:02:54.504 --> 01:02:56.639
AND HAVE HELPED US TO DIVERSIFY

01:02:56.706 --> 01:02:58.708
JUST TWO DAYS AGO I WAS TALKING

01:02:58.774 --> 01:03:00.810
TO THE UC IRVINE PRIME STUDENTS.

01:03:00.877 --> 01:03:02.712
AS THEY CAME UP TO OUR CAPITAL

01:03:02.778 --> 01:03:04.413
TO DO SOME ADVOCACY.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:06.516
AND I WAS IMPRESSED AT THE

01:03:06.582 --> 01:03:08.584
QUALITY OF THE STUDENTS.

01:03:08.651 --> 01:03:10.486
AND THE DIVERSITY THAT

01:03:10.553 --> 01:03:12.889
OFTENTIMES WE DON'T SEE IN OUR

01:03:12.955 --> 01:03:14.590
WORK FORCE THAT I DID NOT SEE IN

01:03:14.657 --> 01:03:16.425
MY PRACTICE AS WELL.

01:03:16.492 --> 01:03:16.993
SO FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN

01:03:17.059 --> 01:03:18.427
SUPPORT PRIME WOULD BE GREAT.

01:03:18.494 --> 01:03:20.830
I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T

01:03:20.897 --> 01:03:22.798
MENTION THE BILL THAT WE WORKED

01:03:22.865 --> 01:03:24.700

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:32.742
COMPETENCIES.

01:03:32.808 --> 01:03:34.810
WE PLACED FIFTY OF THOSE DOCTORS

01:03:34.877 --> 01:03:36.779
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN THE

01:03:36.846 --> 01:03:38.681

BUT THERE ARE SO MANY -- SO MANY

01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:11.327
AVENUES TO GET THERE AND SO MANY

01:07:23.372 --> 01:07:24.874
WANNA JUST ADD -- IN TERMS OF

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:26.876
THE FUTURE I WOULD REALLY LOVE

01:07:26.942 --> 01:07:28.644
IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS FURTHER

01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:29.345
AND THE REASON I SAY THIS I KNOW

01:07:29.412 --> 01:07:30.679
THAT.

01:07:30.746 --> 01:07:32.648
AN ELEMENTARY LEVEL AND MANY

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:33.315
SCHOOLS ARE DOING THIS NOW WERE

01:07:33.382 --> 01:07:35.050
WERE USING CODING AS PART OF THE

01:07:35.117 --> 01:07:36.685
CURRICULUM.

01:07:36.752 --> 01:07:37.286
SO NOW THEY'RE CREATING THESE

01:07:37.353 --> 01:07:39.054
PROGRAMS WHEN THEY'RE LIKE YOU

01:07:39.121 --> 01:07:40.990
KNOW EIGHT YEARS OLD NINE YEARS

01:07:41.056 --> 01:07:42.658
OLD AND I'M THINKING IN TERMS OF

01:07:42.725 --> 01:07:42.958
THE FUTURE.

01:07:43.025 --> 01:07:44.927
THAT'S NOW PART OF THE

01:07:44.994 --> 01:07:46.829
CURRICULUM AND I THINK WE MAY BE.

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:49.098
PUSHING OUR KIDS TO GO DOWN THAT

01:07:49.165 --> 01:07:50.833
THE DIRECTION OF OF PROGRAMMERS

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.768
AND COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY AND AND

01:07:52.835 --> 01:07:55.070
SO THAT'S PART OF THE CURRICULUM

01:07:55.137 --> 01:07:56.839
SO IF THERE'S ANY WAY.

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:57.440
IN THE FUTURE THEY HAVE IDEAS

01:07:57.506 --> 01:07:58.908
WERE WE CAN BRIDGE.

01:07:58.974 --> 01:08:01.076
THAT GAP AND ALSO INCLUDES THESE

01:08:01.143 --> 01:08:04.814
TYPE OF A CAREERS EARLIER ON AT

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:05.414
THE OPEN TO HEAR HIMSELF THINK

01:08:05.481 --> 01:08:05.614
KIA.

01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:07.183
USER TO GALGIANI THE QUESTION

01:08:07.249 --> 01:08:09.185
WAS ASKED EARLIER ABOUT WHAT WE

01:08:09.251 --> 01:08:11.086
COULD DO TO MOVE ALONG AT A

01:08:11.153 --> 01:08:12.955
SCHOOL OF MEDICINE IN THE

01:08:13.022 --> 01:08:13.355
CENTRAL VALLEY.

01:08:13.422 --> 01:08:15.124
AND IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:16.992
SEVENTEEN IN THE BUDGET --

01:08:17.059 --> 01:08:18.861
SENATOR MITCHELL YOU MIGHT

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:20.763
REMEMBER THE MCO DEAL WHERE WE

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:22.965
RECEIVED ONE POINT EIGHT FIVE

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:24.800
FIVE MILLION FOR THE THE TWO

01:08:24.867 --> 01:08:26.735
THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND

01:08:26.802 --> 01:08:28.838
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGETS IT'S

01:08:28.904 --> 01:08:30.773
SO WAS A TWO YEAR PLAN.

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:34.743
AND IT WAS TO PROVIDE FUNDING

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:35.377
FOR FORTY EIGHT NEW STUDENTS IN

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:37.112
THE PROGRAM IN MEDICAL EDUCATION

01:08:37.179 --> 01:08:39.014
THE PRIME PROGRAM SO SINCE THAT

01:08:39.081 --> 01:08:41.217
MONEY IS GONE NOW IF WE WERE TO

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:43.185
REINVEST IN THAT THAT WOULD GIVE

01:08:43.252 --> 01:08:44.787
US.

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:46.755
A GOOD BASIS TO MOVE FORWARD --

01:08:46.822 --> 01:08:47.389
WE KNEW WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:49.225
BRING A SCHOOL OF MEDICINE HE'S

01:08:49.291 --> 01:08:49.525
EVER SAID.

01:08:49.592 --> 01:08:50.993
THAT BY THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:53.195
AND FIFTEEN WE WOULD HAVE A

01:08:53.262 --> 01:08:56.932
STATEWIDE SHORTAGES SEVENTEEN

01:08:56.999 --> 01:08:58.801
THOUSAND POSITIONS IN THE STATE.

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:00.769
AND NOW AT AROUND TWO THIRDS OF

01:09:00.836 --> 01:09:02.872
OUR PHYSICIANS ARE OVER THE AGE

01:09:02.938 --> 01:09:04.840
OF FIFTY FIVE SO WE ARE.

01:09:04.907 --> 01:09:06.876
ARE FACED WITH THE SILVER

01:09:06.942 --> 01:09:08.744
TSUNAMI OF ALL OF OUR PHYSICIANS

01:09:08.811 --> 01:09:10.746
RETIRING IF WE'RE NOT DOING

01:09:10.813 --> 01:09:11.280
SOMETHING DIFFERENT GOING

01:09:11.347 --> 01:09:13.115
FORWARD SO I THINK THERE'S A

01:09:13.182 --> 01:09:14.984
REAL OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST IN

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:17.186
PRIME -- FOR BOTH FRESNO AND

01:09:17.253 --> 01:09:25.194
MERCED TO ADDRESS OUR STATEWIDE

01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:26.896
ISSUE.

01:09:26.962 --> 01:09:29.064
I THINK THAT -- AS WE AS THE

01:09:29.131 --> 01:09:30.933
STATE LOOKS AT PURSUING THE MCO

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:31.600
TAX AND AND WE BEGIN OUR KIND OF

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.269
PARKING LOT LIST OF OF ITEMS WE

01:09:33.335 --> 01:09:35.104
HOPE IT WILL FUND.

01:09:35.170 --> 01:09:37.206
WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF HOW

01:09:37.273 --> 01:09:38.908
THOSE DOLLARS WERE SPENT.

01:09:38.974 --> 01:09:41.243
DR RANDALL I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:42.978

PANEL UP.

01:09:45.814 --> 01:09:47.116
AND THERE'S A QUESTION OR

01:09:47.182 --> 01:09:49.084
STATEMENT NO IT WAS MORE OF A

01:09:49.151 --> 01:09:49.485
THANK YOU TO DR.

LISTEN TO ALL OF THE COMMENTS

01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:09.004
AND WE RECOGNIZE WHAT THE STATE

01:10:09.071 --> 01:10:10.973
HAS DONE HASN'T DONE AREAS THAT

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.008
WE WE STEPPED UP -- ONCE OUR OUR

01:10:13.075 --> 01:10:15.110
GENERAL FUND WAS BACK IN THE

01:10:15.177 --> 01:10:17.146
BLACK AND WE WERE NO LONGER

01:10:17.212 --> 01:10:19.014
BROKE.

01:10:19.081 --> 01:10:19.481
AND CUTTING PROGRAMS.

01:10:19.548 --> 01:10:21.050
THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE A LOT

01:10:21.116 --> 01:10:22.952
OF WORK IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS

01:10:23.018 --> 01:10:23.652
IN MAKING COMMUNITY COLLEGE FREE.

01:10:23.719 --> 01:10:25.387
AND WE NEED TO STEP BACK AND

01:10:25.454 --> 01:10:27.089
FIGURE OUT HOW WE ADDRESS

01:10:27.156 --> 01:10:28.991
MEDICAL SCHOOL DEBT.

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:31.026
BECAUSE AS WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:10:31.093 --> 01:10:31.660
POPULATIONS WE WANNA -- REACH

01:10:31.727 --> 01:10:33.429
OUT TO THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S A

01:10:33.495 --> 01:10:35.431
REALITY IN TERMS OF EVEN HOW YOU

01:10:35.497 --> 01:10:37.333
WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND HOW YOU

01:10:37.399 --> 01:10:39.001
COULD AFFORD MEDICAL SCHOOL.

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:40.970
THE OTHER TWO QUICK COMMENTS I'M

01:10:41.036 --> 01:10:42.972
GONNA MAKE A MISSILE PUT HIM OUT

01:10:43.038 --> 01:10:43.606
THERE -- MODELING NECESSARILY

01:10:43.672 --> 01:10:45.174
EXPECT ANSWERS UNLESS YOU HAVE A

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:47.009
BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE.

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:51.046
YOU KNOW SYSTEMIC BIAS AND THE

01:10:51.113 --> 01:10:53.215
IMPACT IT HAS ON POOR CHILDREN

01:10:53.282 --> 01:10:55.017
CHILDREN OF COLOR.

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:57.319
YOU KNOW -- I WONDER WHAT ROLE

01:10:57.386 --> 01:10:59.388
PROP TWO OH NINE PLAYED IN

01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:01.256
IMPACTING MED SCHOOL DIVERSITY

01:11:01.323 --> 01:11:03.025
IN OUR PUBLICLY FUNDED MED

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:05.027
SCHOOLS AS FEW AS THEY ARE --

01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:06.962
BUT BUT WE DIDN'T HELP MATTERS

01:11:07.029 --> 01:11:08.998
WITH PROP.

01:11:09.064 --> 01:11:11.033
TWO OH NINE AS WE SPENT A LOT OF

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:11.667
TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE TO HEAR

01:11:11.734 --> 01:11:13.302
TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT IMPLICIT

01:11:13.369 --> 01:11:15.004
BIAS HOUSE ON THE HEALTHCARE.

01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:17.306
DELIVERY SYSTEM IN TERMS OF

01:11:17.373 --> 01:11:19.074
THOSE OF US WHO EXPERIENCE THAT

01:11:19.141 --> 01:11:21.343
WE HAVE TO BE MINDFUL OF OF WHAT

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:23.379
MESSAGE WE SENT AS A STATE.

01:11:23.445 --> 01:11:27.549
ON WITH THE PASSAGE OF TWO OH

01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:29.351
NINE THE OTHER PIECE I WOULD

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:29.685
WOULD DROP.

01:11:29.752 --> 01:11:31.020
IS.

01:11:31.086 --> 01:11:33.322
WITH REGARD TO THE UC SYSTEM AS

01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:33.989
WELL AND I WASN'T AWARE THIS IT

01:11:34.056 --> 01:11:35.491
WAS MY OWN HEALTH CARE PROVIDER

01:11:35.557 --> 01:11:37.593
WHO IS A UC DAVIS ALONE WHO

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:39.428
BROUGHT IT TO MY ATTENTION THE

01:11:39.495 --> 01:11:39.862
FORM OF A QUESTION.

01:11:39.928 --> 01:11:41.530
WHICH IS WHY THE UC SYSTEM AND

01:11:41.597 --> 01:11:43.499
AND AND YOUR HOSPITALS DON'T

01:11:43.565 --> 01:11:47.069
ACCEPT MEDICARE -- FROM HIS

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:47.670
PERSPECTIVE HE SAYS YOU KNOW

01:11:47.736 --> 01:11:49.071
YOU'RE PUBLICLY FUNDED

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:51.206
INSTITUTION AND YET IF YOU'RE

01:11:51.273 --> 01:11:51.774
NOT A PART OF THE MEDICARE

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.609
SYSTEM AND SO I DON'T EXPECT YOU

01:11:53.676 --> 01:11:55.210
ALL TO TO ANSWER THAT.

01:11:55.277 --> 01:11:57.079
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE JUST

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:57.446
LAID OUT THERE.

01:11:57.513 --> 01:11:59.348
FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION --

01:11:59.415 --> 01:12:03.085
BECAUSE AS WE TALK ABOUT HOW WE

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:05.154
WE'VE A SYSTEM THAT MEETS ALL

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:07.156
NEEDS AS WE ARE BEING ASKED TO

01:12:07.222 --> 01:12:09.391
PUT PUBLIC FUNDS INTO THE SYSTEM

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:11.427
TO EXPAND -- THE NUMBER OF

01:12:11.493 --> 01:12:13.495
MEDICAL SCHOOLS AND AND YOU SEE

01:12:13.562 --> 01:12:15.397
HEALTH SYSTEMS ACROSS THE BOARD

01:12:15.464 --> 01:12:17.466
I THINK WE IT WOULD BE FAIR TO

01:12:17.533 --> 01:12:19.401
EXPECT THAT THE UC STEP UP ALSO.

01:12:19.468 --> 01:12:23.238
IN TERMS OF BEING -- MEDI CAL

01:12:23.305 --> 01:12:25.207
PROVIDERS AND SO I THINK THAT'S

01:12:25.274 --> 01:12:27.142
WHAT THAT WE HAVE TO DO THE

01:12:27.209 --> 01:12:29.211
NURSE PRACTITIONERS FULL SCOPE I

01:12:29.278 --> 01:12:31.447
STILL HAVE MISSING TEETH FROM A

01:12:31.513 --> 01:12:39.121
BILL I. KERRY SCOPE OF WORK -- I

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:39.788
HEAR YOU WHEN I GET IN THE MAKES

01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:41.323
PERFECT SENSE AND YOU KNOW

01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:43.358
SOMETIMES WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE

01:12:43.425 --> 01:12:45.127
PROVIDER COMMUNITY.

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:45.694
THERE TENDS TO BE A LITTLE

01:12:45.761 --> 01:12:49.164
COMPETITION -- AND SO I THINK --

01:12:49.231 --> 01:12:51.200
I'VE HEARD THE BILL COMING I. I

01:12:51.266 --> 01:12:51.800
LOOK FOR TO US TO CONTINUE TO

01:12:51.867 --> 01:12:53.302
HAVE THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE IT

01:12:53.368 --> 01:12:55.504
MAKES SENSE IN OUR EFFORT TO TRY

01:12:55.571 --> 01:12:57.139
TO MAKE SURE THAT.

01:12:57.206 --> 01:12:59.208
THAT THAT THAT HEALTHCARE AT THE

01:12:59.274 --> 01:13:01.243
COMMUNITY LEVEL IS HIGH QUALITY

01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:03.078
YES ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE

01:13:03.145 --> 01:13:03.746
AND CERTAINLY EXPANDING THE WORK

01:13:03.812 --> 01:13:07.182
THAT NURSE PRACTITIONERS -- DO

01:13:07.249 --> 01:13:09.251
MAKE PERFECT SENSE ANY FINAL

01:13:09.318 --> 01:13:11.186
QUICK COMMENTS BEFORE WE YES

01:13:11.253 --> 01:13:13.255
JUST LIKE OUR IMPLICIT BIAS --

01:13:13.322 --> 01:13:15.157
QUESTION ABSOLUTELY PROP TO

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:15.557
ATTEND HEY HUGE.

01:13:15.624 --> 01:13:19.194
IMPACT ON THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS

01:13:19.261 --> 01:13:19.628
SEES AT UC SCHOOLS.

01:13:19.695 --> 01:13:23.198
AND OVER TIME WE'VE GRADUALLY --

01:13:23.265 --> 01:13:25.434
FOUND WAYS TO OVERCOME THAT --

01:13:25.501 --> 01:13:26.068
OBVIOUSLY WE STILL HAVE A LOT

01:13:26.135 --> 01:13:29.271
MORE TO DO -- BUT I DID WANT TO

01:13:29.338 --> 01:13:29.805
ASK THE PANEL TO CONSIDER

01:13:29.872 --> 01:13:31.640
LOOKING AT SOMETHING YOU'VE GOT

01:13:31.707 --> 01:13:33.675
A BIG RESEARCH TEAM UP AT THE

01:13:33.742 --> 01:13:35.511
CAPITOL -- I WOULD BE VERY

01:13:35.577 --> 01:13:39.515
INTERESTED FOR YOU TO EXPLORE

01:13:39.581 --> 01:13:39.815
[INAUDIBLE]

01:13:39.882 --> 01:13:41.216
THE NUMBER.

01:13:41.283 --> 01:13:43.218
ANTHONY UC FACULTY I'D.

01:13:43.285 --> 01:13:45.287
TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THAT -- WHEN

01:13:45.354 --> 01:13:47.389
YOU LOOK AT IT WHO'S BEEN

01:13:47.456 --> 01:13:49.458
ACCEPTED INTO OUR UC SCHOOLS OF

01:13:49.525 --> 01:13:51.193
MEDICINE WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.195
GRADUATES FROM CSU CAMPUSES

01:13:53.262 --> 01:13:55.364
VERSUS GRADUATE FROM UC CAN'T --

01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.697
UC CAMPUSES.

01:13:55.764 --> 01:13:57.499
YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT THOSE

01:13:57.566 --> 01:14:01.303
STATISTICS AND LET'S TALK ABOUT

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:03.472

THAT THEY'VE LONG BEEN

01:17:20.168 --> 01:17:21.870
RECOGNIZED BUT THEIR IMPORTANCE

01:17:21.937 --> 01:17:23.372
IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED.

01:17:23.438 --> 01:17:25.507
IT HAS BEEN WELL OVER A DECADE

01:17:25.574 --> 01:17:26.041
SINCE LITERATURE ON THE

01:17:26.108 --> 01:17:27.776
IMPORTANCE OF ADDRESSING SOCIAL

01:17:27.843 --> 01:17:29.478

EMERGENCY ROOM DUE TO AS MY

01:17:53.635 --> 01:17:55.470
RELATED COMPLICATIONS WHICH

01:17:55.537 --> 01:17:57.472
ACCOUNT FOR OVER. TEN MILLION

01:17:57.539 --> 01:18:01.443
DOLLARS PER YEAR -- INGESTED

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.910
FRESNO COUNTY ALONE.

01:18:01.977 --> 01:18:03.879
CHILDREN I'M IN OTHER REGIONS OF

01:18:03.945 --> 01:18:05.614
CALIFORNIA ARE NOT SEEN -- QUITE

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:07.816
THE NUMBER OF HOSPITALIZATIONS

01:18:07.883 --> 01:18:11.453
AS THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND FRESNO

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.455
AND WE KNOW THAT PARTLY THESE

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:13.989
CONDITIONS ARE DUE TO THE

01:18:14.056 --> 01:18:15.791
CONDITIONS OF THE HOMES WHERE

01:18:15.857 --> 01:18:17.592
OUR CHILDREN LIVE.

01:18:17.659 --> 01:18:19.561
AND THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE

01:18:19.628 --> 01:18:21.463
THESE HOMES ARE SITUATED WE'VE

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:23.465
HEARD TIME AND TIME AGAIN ISSUES

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:25.634
OF MILDEW AND HOUSING PROXIMITY

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:27.736
OF NEIGHBORHOODS TO ROADWAY TEN

01:18:27.803 --> 01:18:29.638
MAJOR ROADWAYS AND OTHER

01:18:29.704 --> 01:18:31.506
POLLUTING SOURCES.

01:18:31.573 --> 01:18:32.174
IT'S NOT A SECRET THAT THE VAST

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:33.909
MAJORITY OF HEAVY INDUSTRY USES

01:18:33.975 --> 01:18:35.877
IN FRESNO COUNTY AND PRESENT THE

01:18:35.944 --> 01:18:37.779
CITY OF FRESNO IS CLUSTERED IN

01:18:37.846 --> 01:18:41.550
WEST FRESNO HE WANTS RED LINE

01:18:41.616 --> 01:18:42.050
COMMUNITY THAT IS OUR

01:18:42.117 --> 01:18:43.652
TRADITIONAL HOME FOR AFRICAN

01:18:43.718 --> 01:18:45.487
AMERICAN COMMUNITY MEMBERS.

01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:46.088
AND THEN IN THE FORTIES AND

01:18:46.154 --> 01:18:47.689
FIFTIES BECAME THE PLACE FOR

01:18:47.756 --> 01:18:51.493
MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS WERE -- WERE.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.728
FORCED TO LIVE IN WE KNOW THAT

01:18:53.795 --> 01:18:55.730
AND CAL LARA WHICH WAS ALSO ONCE

01:18:55.797 --> 01:18:57.666
A RED LINE COMMUNITY BUT IT WAS

01:18:57.732 --> 01:18:59.534
THE OPPOSITE IT WAS PRIMARILY IT

01:18:59.601 --> 01:19:00.102
WAS AN ALL WHITE COMMUNITY.

01:19:00.168 --> 01:19:01.903
UP UNTIL THE CITY OF FRESNO

01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:03.738
STARTED TO ANNEX THE SURROUNDING

01:19:03.805 --> 01:19:05.841
LAND AND PURSES OWNED IT FOR

01:19:05.907 --> 01:19:07.676
HEAVY INDUSTRY USES AND SO OVER

01:19:07.742 --> 01:19:09.778
TIME WE SEE TODAY NOW HOW WAS

01:19:09.845 --> 01:19:11.613
HOME 280%.

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:13.648
LATINO COMMUNITIES MOST --

01:19:13.715 --> 01:19:17.619
COMMUNITIES ARE MEXICAN

01:19:17.686 --> 01:19:19.521
IMMIGRANTS.

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:20.155
AND SO AS WE KNOW -- WHERE YOU

01:19:20.222 --> 01:19:23.592
LIVE WORK LEARN AND PLAY HAS A

01:19:23.658 --> 01:19:25.460
PROFOUND IMPACT ON NOT ONLY HOW

01:19:25.527 --> 01:19:27.562
YOU LIVE BUT HOW LONG YOU LIVE

01:19:27.629 --> 01:19:29.564
WE ALL KNOW THE FACT THAT WEST

01:19:29.631 --> 01:19:31.900
RESONANCE LIVE TWENTY YEARS LESS

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:33.802
THAN THEIR NORTH FRESNO

01:19:33.869 --> 01:19:34.136
COUNTERPARTS?

01:19:34.202 --> 01:19:35.770
THAT'S NOT AN ACCIDENT.

01:19:35.837 --> 01:19:37.572
THIS IS BECAUSE SOCIAL

01:19:37.639 --> 01:19:39.608
DETERMINANTS INSERT.

01:19:39.674 --> 01:19:41.576
EXERT THEIR INFLUENCE ON CHILD

01:19:41.643 --> 01:19:43.578
HEALTH THREE COMPLEX

01:19:43.645 --> 01:19:43.945
INTERRELATED --

01:19:44.012 --> 01:19:45.881
INTERRELATIONSHIP OF MORE DISTAL

01:19:45.947 --> 01:19:47.983
SOCIAL FACTORS SUCH AS INCOME

01:19:48.049 --> 01:19:49.918
AND EDUCATION WITH MORE PROXIMAL

01:19:49.985 --> 01:19:52.053
FACTORS SUCH AS HEALTH BEHAVIORS

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.189
WHICH ARE HIGHLY INFLUENCED BY

01:19:54.256 --> 01:19:55.624
YOUR BUILT ENVIRONMENT.

01:19:55.690 --> 01:19:57.959
WE KNOW THAT 52% OF RESIDENTS IN

01:19:58.026 --> 01:19:59.828
THE CITY OF FRESNO DO NOT LIVE

01:19:59.895 --> 01:20:01.863
WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF A

01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:05.567
QUALITY PARK THEREFORE LIMITING

01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:06.234
THEIR ABILITY TED AND ENGAGE IN

01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:07.602

01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:09.804
AND EXERCISE AND AND OTHER

01:20:09.871 --> 01:20:11.640
HEALTH CONDUCIR BEHAVIORS WE

01:20:11.706 --> 01:20:13.575
KNOW THAT CHILDREN WHO HAVE

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:14.176
ACCESS TO QUALITY OUT DURING

01:20:14.242 --> 01:20:15.977
GREENSPACE OPPORTUNITIES DO

01:20:16.044 --> 01:20:18.180
BETTER IN MATH AND SCIENCE SO AS

01:20:18.246 --> 01:20:19.981
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INCREASING

01:20:20.048 --> 01:20:22.117
OUR WORK FORCE IN OUR HEALTH

01:20:22.184 --> 01:20:23.952
SECTOR WE'RE SETTING UP OUR

01:20:24.019 --> 01:20:24.352
CHILDREN TO FAIL.

01:20:24.419 --> 01:20:25.954
BUT JUST THE FACT THAT THEY DO

01:20:26.021 --> 01:20:27.689
NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A QUALITY

01:20:27.756 --> 01:20:28.156
GREEN SPACE IN THEIR

01:20:28.223 --> 01:20:29.791
NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:20:29.858 --> 01:20:31.693
THAT'S ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:32.260
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOCIAL

01:20:32.327 --> 01:20:33.929
DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH THE WAYS

01:20:33.995 --> 01:20:35.697
BY WHICH SOCIAL DETERMINANTS

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:37.899
BEAR THEIR INFLUENCE OPERATE

01:20:37.966 --> 01:20:41.736
OVER TIME AND ACROSS GENERATIONS.

01:20:41.803 --> 01:20:42.304
CREATING GREATER DISPARITIES

01:20:42.370 --> 01:20:44.206
WITH EACH GENERATION THAT GOES

01:20:44.272 --> 01:20:45.774
BY.

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.676
IT SHOULD BE THE OPPOSITE WE

01:20:47.742 --> 01:20:48.310
KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHO COME TO

01:20:48.376 --> 01:20:49.978
THIS COUNTRY IMMIGRANTS COME

01:20:50.045 --> 01:20:51.980
HERE FOR OPPORTUNITY.

01:20:52.047 --> 01:20:53.882
RIGHT THAT WE WANT TO SEE OUR

01:20:53.949 --> 01:20:54.316
CHILDREN SUCCEED AND

01:20:54.382 --> 01:20:57.686
UNFORTUNATELY THE SYSTEMS THAT

01:21:15.804 --> 01:21:16.338
KEEP THAT IN MIND SO WE'RE

01:21:16.404 --> 01:21:18.006
TALKING ABOUT WHY WE DON'T DO

01:21:18.073 --> 01:21:20.075

01:23:55.997 --> 01:23:56.564
NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT IN

01:23:56.631 --> 01:23:57.966
THE NATION.

01:23:58.032 --> 01:23:59.934

IN THE CITY OF FRESNO BUT WE

01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:52.900

FELT MORE COMFORTABLE WITH US.

01:34:54.655 --> 01:34:55.256
ONE OF THE THINGS THEY WANT TO

01:34:55.322 --> 01:34:56.891
KEEP TALKING ABOUT AND ECHOING

01:34:56.957 --> 01:35:00.561
AS THE IMPORTANCE OF OFFERING --

01:35:00.628 --> 01:35:02.563

IT'S WORKING.

01:35:06.667 --> 01:35:08.969
THE OTHER THING THAT WE TOOK IT

01:35:09.036 --> 01:35:10.604
UPON OURSELVES.

01:35:10.671 --> 01:35:12.907
WITH DOCTORS WRONG AS THE SPEAR

01:35:12.973 --> 01:35:14.775
HEAD WAS CREATING A TRAINING

01:35:14.842 --> 01:35:16.610
PROGRAM.

01:35:16.677 --> 01:35:17.178

CLINICIANS.

01:35:30.691 --> 01:35:32.760
THERE'S SOMETHING THERE --

01:35:32.827 --> 01:35:33.127
THAT'S MISSING.

01:35:33.194 --> 01:35:36.664
I HAVE TO MAN AFTER I LEFT IT

01:35:36.730 --> 01:35:36.864
HAS.

01:35:36.931 --> 01:35:40.568
GIVEN ME A DIFFERENT LINES WHEN

01:35:40.634 --> 01:35:44.772
I APPROACH OUR CLIENTS.

01:35:44.839 --> 01:35:46.740
I REALLY WANT TO REITERATE THE

01:35:46.807 --> 01:35:48.609
IMPORTANCE OF GROWING OUR OWN.

01:35:48.676 --> 01:35:51.078
MAYBE PERHAPS WE DIDN'T KNOW

01:35:51.145 --> 01:35:52.980
WHAT WAS OUT THERE SO WE

01:35:53.047 --> 01:35:54.915
RECENTLY KNEW THAT WE NEEDED TO

01:35:54.982 --> 01:35:56.617
HELP WE NEEDED IT TODAY.

01:35:56.684 --> 01:35:58.919
AND SO WE BEGAN THIS TRAINING

01:35:58.986 --> 01:36:02.623
PROGRAM VERY.

01:36:02.690 --> 01:36:06.760
YEAH STILL HUMBLE -- AND I'M

01:36:06.827 --> 01:36:08.796
HAPPY TO BE A PART OF IT -- I DO

01:36:08.863 --> 01:36:09.396
THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE

01:36:09.463 --> 01:36:12.766
FUNDING AROUND THESE THINGS.

01:36:12.833 --> 01:36:13.367
SO MY LAST TWO THINGS THAT I

01:36:13.434 --> 01:36:16.770
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS JUST. ONE

01:36:16.837 --> 01:36:18.706
PLEASE SUPPORT DISAGGREGATED

01:36:18.772 --> 01:36:20.674
DATA FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION AND

01:36:20.741 --> 01:36:22.743
HEALTH AGENCIES.

01:36:22.810 --> 01:36:24.979
HISTORICALLY THE ASIAN PACIFIC

01:36:25.045 --> 01:36:26.881
ISLANDER COMMUNITY HAS BEEN.

01:36:26.947 --> 01:36:28.949
COUPLE TOGETHER BUT BECAUSE OF

01:36:29.016 --> 01:36:30.985
THAT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO SEE THE

01:36:31.051 --> 01:36:32.820
TRUE NEED OF SOME OF OUR

01:36:32.887 --> 01:36:34.722
SOUTHEAST ASIAN COUNTERPARTS.

01:36:34.788 --> 01:36:37.091
THEIR NEED IS JUST UNIQUE AT THE

01:36:37.158 --> 01:36:39.026
VERY LEAST THE MALL COMMITTEE

01:36:39.093 --> 01:36:40.995
ONLY CAME HERE FORTY YEARS AGO.

01:36:41.061 --> 01:36:44.732
MY PARENTS STILL SPEAK ONLY LONG.

01:36:44.798 --> 01:36:46.700
AND EVEN WHEN WE GO TO LIKE

01:36:46.767 --> 01:36:49.003
APPOINTMENTS I HAVE TO GO AND

01:36:49.069 --> 01:36:49.303
TRANSLATE.

01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:51.038
THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN SOME

01:36:51.105 --> 01:36:52.773
OF OUR YOU KNOW BROTHERS AND

01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:53.374
SISTERS HAVE BEEN HERE FOR A

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:56.744
LITTLE BIT LONGER.

01:36:56.810 --> 01:36:58.946
I THINK THE DATA ITSELF WILL

01:36:59.013 --> 01:37:00.915
HELP AND I SEE IT BETTER AND

01:37:00.981 --> 01:37:03.017
ALSO PERHAPS GET MORE FUNDING

01:37:03.083 --> 01:37:04.752
FOR FUNDING IS NEEDED.

01:37:04.818 --> 01:37:07.054
THE LAST THING I WANT TO TALK

01:37:07.121 --> 01:37:08.789
ABOUT IS DEFINITELY LIKE

MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND CARE.

01:37:14.795 --> 01:37:15.362
I DO BELIEVE THERE IS A BILL OUT

01:37:15.429 --> 01:37:19.033
THERE -- EIGHTY FIVE TWELVE

01:37:19.099 --> 01:37:19.600
CULTURAL COMPETENCY COUNTY

01:37:19.667 --> 01:37:20.868
MENTAL HEALTH.

01:37:20.935 --> 01:37:24.738
THESE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT.

01:37:24.805 --> 01:37:25.339
AND THE LAST THING I WANT TO

01:37:25.406 --> 01:37:28.742
TALK ABOUT IS.

01:37:28.809 --> 01:37:29.343
I KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF PAPERS

01:37:29.410 --> 01:37:30.744
APPEAR.

01:37:30.811 --> 01:37:32.880
WE'RE TRYING OUR BEST TO HONOR

01:37:32.947 --> 01:37:39.053
THE SPACE -- THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:37:39.119 --> 01:37:41.088
IMPLEMENTING ETHNIC STUDIES FROM

01:37:41.155 --> 01:37:46.860
THE CATER TWELVE TO HIGH SCHOOL.

01:37:46.927 --> 01:37:47.461
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNE AND WHICH

01:37:47.528 --> 01:37:50.831
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT PREVENTION.

01:37:50.898 --> 01:37:52.933
WHEN WE TEACH OUR KIDS ABOUT THE

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.802
DIVERSITY THAT EXISTS IN

01:37:54.868 --> 01:37:56.870
CALIFORNIA THE HOPE SAYS THAT?

01:37:56.937 --> 01:37:58.806
THERE WILL BE LESS POLARIZATION

01:37:58.872 --> 01:37:59.240
AND MORE DIALOGUE.

01:37:59.306 --> 01:38:01.208
DIALOGUE ABOUT REALLY DIFFICULT

01:38:01.275 --> 01:38:02.743
CONVERSATION.

01:38:02.810 --> 01:38:05.145
AROUND GENDER MAYBE AROUND RACE

01:38:05.212 --> 01:38:10.851
ABOUT SOCIAL INEQUALITIES.

01:38:10.918 --> 01:38:12.853
AND AS ALWAYS RIGHT.

01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:13.487
ALSO WE WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT

01:38:13.554 --> 01:38:15.256
ABC THIRTEEN NINETY THREE THE

01:38:15.322 --> 01:38:17.224
LAOTIAN HISTORIES AND CULTURAL

01:38:17.291 --> 01:38:18.859

01:38:18.926 --> 01:38:24.865
I NEED TO BE INCLUDED.

01:38:24.932 --> 01:38:27.134
I'M NOT SURE WHAT ELSE TO SAY

01:38:27.201 --> 01:38:30.838
BETH ON EVEN TODAY AS A C. HERE.

01:38:30.904 --> 01:38:34.842
I AM AN AND I GUESS.

01:38:37.111 --> 01:38:39.179
AMAZING AND SUPPORTIVE PROGRAMS

01:38:39.246 --> 01:38:42.850
I DIDN'T GET HERE BY CHANCE.

01:38:42.916 --> 01:38:45.019
IT WAS INSTRUMENTAL -- DESIGN

01:38:45.085 --> 01:38:48.822
WITH COMPASSION AND INTENTION

01:38:48.889 --> 01:38:50.824
AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE A SITE

01:38:50.891 --> 01:38:51.458
WHEN WE CONTINUE TO DESIGN OUR

01:38:51.525 --> 01:38:54.962
LEGISLATION WE NEED TO HAVE

01:38:55.029 --> 01:38:55.429
THESE THINGS IN MIND.

01:38:55.496 --> 01:38:57.264
WHICH CHANGING WORDS WE REALLY

01:38:57.331 --> 01:39:00.834
IMPACT FAMILIES THAT WE DIDN'T

01:39:00.901 --> 01:39:02.870

IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE GO ABOUT

01:39:11.211 --> 01:39:12.880
IT WITH OUR HEARTS.

01:39:12.946 --> 01:39:15.015
AND SO THAT MANY COMMUNITIES

01:39:15.082 --> 01:39:17.017
WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN.

01:39:17.084 --> 01:39:24.858
THANK YOU.

01:39:24.925 --> 01:39:25.426
I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S GOOD

01:39:25.492 --> 01:39:27.261
MORNING OR GOOD AFTERNOON EITHER

01:39:27.328 --> 01:39:29.196

01:39:37.071 --> 01:39:39.106
COUNTERPARTS HERE MY COLLEAGUES --

01:39:39.173 --> 01:39:41.108
AND TO BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY

01:39:41.175 --> 01:39:42.943
TO TALK ABOUT A PARTICULAR GROUP

01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:44.845
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SEEING

01:39:44.912 --> 01:39:45.446
IN THE NEWS LATELY A LOT BUT

01:39:45.512 --> 01:39:47.314
DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT THEY'RE

01:39:47.381 --> 01:39:50.984
IN OUR COMMUNITIES -- SO I WORK

01:39:51.051 --> 01:39:52.920
WITH UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN --

01:39:52.986 --> 01:39:55.089
THEY ARE CHILDREN WHO ENTERED

01:39:55.155 --> 01:39:55.756
THE UNITED STATES BEFORE THE AGE

01:39:55.823 --> 01:39:57.358
OF EIGHTEEN WITHOUT A PARENT OR

01:39:57.424 --> 01:40:00.994
LEGAL GUARDIAN -- THE MAJORITY

01:40:01.061 --> 01:40:01.595
OF THE CHILDREN THAT WE WORK

01:40:01.662 --> 01:40:03.230
WITH ARE FLEEING VIOLENCE

01:40:03.297 --> 01:40:06.934
PERSECUTION NEGLECT -- INDOOR

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:07.468
ABANDONMENT IN THEIR HOME

01:40:07.534 --> 01:40:09.036
COUNTRIES.

01:40:09.103 --> 01:40:09.703
AND THEY LARGELY COME FROM THE

01:40:09.770 --> 01:40:11.405
NORTHERN TRIANGLE OF HONDURAS EL

01:40:11.472 --> 01:40:13.273
SALVADOR AND GUATEMALA.

01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:14.975
WHEN THEY ARRIVE AT THE BORDER

01:40:15.042 --> 01:40:17.077
THEY'RE USUALLY HUNGRY TIRED AND

01:40:17.144 --> 01:40:17.311
SCARED?

01:40:17.378 --> 01:40:19.179
THE FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH THE US

01:40:19.246 --> 01:40:21.315
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS RUSH

01:40:21.382 --> 01:40:21.949

SHELTER STAFF.

01:40:23.150 --> 01:40:25.152
SOME OF THEIR HEALTH PROBLEMS OR

01:40:25.219 --> 01:40:27.154
EVEN WORSENED DURING THEIR TIME

01:40:27.221 --> 01:40:31.058
AT BORDER PATROL CUSTODY -- FROM

01:40:31.125 --> 01:40:33.127
DAY ONE THEIR EXPERIENCE OF THE

01:40:33.193 --> 01:40:34.995
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.

01:40:35.062 --> 01:40:35.429
AFFECTS YOUR VIEWS.

01:40:35.496 --> 01:40:37.398
EVEN AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE

01:40:37.464 --> 01:40:38.966
DETENTION LIVING IN THE SHADOW

01:40:39.032 --> 01:40:39.533

SENSE OF CONNECTION TO SYSTEMS

01:40:41.435 --> 01:40:42.970
IN THEIR COMMUNITY.

01:40:43.036 --> 01:40:44.938
AND IT EMOTIONALLY BURDENS THEM

01:40:45.005 --> 01:40:45.506
FAR BEYOND WHAT THEIR YOUNG

01:40:45.572 --> 01:40:46.974
MINDS CAN PROCESS.

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:49.209
WELL UNACCOMPANIED MINORS DO YOU

01:40:49.276 --> 01:40:51.211
BENEFIT FROM SOME CHILD SPECIFIC

SAFEGUARDS THE US GOVERNMENT

01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:53.747
DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY CHILD

01:40:53.814 --> 01:40:55.349
REGARDLESS OF AGE WITH THE FREE

01:40:55.416 --> 01:40:56.984
ATTORNEY.

01:40:57.050 --> 01:40:57.584
THAT MEANS THAT THEY HAVE TO

01:40:57.651 --> 01:40:59.153
FACE THE COMPLEX IMMIGRATION

01:40:59.219 --> 01:41:00.988
SYSTEM ON THEIR OWN.

01:41:01.054 --> 01:41:03.190
STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT.

01:41:03.257 --> 01:41:05.259
MINORS ARE FIVE TIMES MORE

01:41:05.325 --> 01:41:06.960
LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO REMAIN

01:41:07.027 --> 01:41:09.129
SAFELY IN THE UNITED STATES IF

01:41:09.196 --> 01:41:09.630
THEY HAVE AN ATTORNEY.

01:41:09.696 --> 01:41:11.331
NATIONALLY CALIFORNIA AND TEXAS

HEALTH AND DENTAL CARE --

01:44:09.443 --> 01:44:11.511
SYSTEMS. ONE OF THE MOST

01:44:11.578 --> 01:44:13.380
IMPORTANT IS THE OBSTACLE OR IN

PAN IN LIMITED OR NON EXISTING

01:44:15.449 --> 01:44:17.284
TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS.

01:44:17.351 --> 01:44:19.186
REPRESENT A BARRIER FOR CHILDREN

01:44:19.252 --> 01:44:21.254
TO CONNECT TO REALLY IMPORTANT

01:44:21.321 --> 01:44:23.190
RESOURCES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES

01:44:23.256 --> 01:44:23.724
OR EVEN THEIR ATTORNEYS.

01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:25.525
CHILDREN WHO RESIDE IN THE

01:44:25.592 --> 01:44:27.260
CENTRAL VALLEY HAVE TO GO TO

01:44:27.327 --> 01:44:27.928
COURT IN SAN FRANCISCO WHICH CAN

01:44:27.995 --> 01:44:29.663
BE TWO TO FIVE HOURS AWAY FOR

01:44:29.730 --> 01:44:31.231
THEM.

01:44:31.298 --> 01:44:33.166
SOMETIMES OUR COURT HEARINGS ARE

01:44:33.233 --> 01:44:33.800
EIGHT THIRTY IN THE MORNING AND

01:44:33.867 --> 01:44:35.736
THEY HAVE TO LEAVE THE VALLEY AT

01:44:35.802 --> 01:44:37.571
THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TO

01:44:37.638 --> 01:44:39.239
GET THERE IN TIME AND PAY.

01:44:39.306 --> 01:44:39.806
PEOPLE TO GIVE THEM RIGHTS

01:44:39.873 --> 01:44:41.575
BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND THREE

01:44:41.642 --> 01:44:43.243
HUNDRED DOLLARS.

01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:45.212
IF THEY MISS THEIR COURT HEARING

01:44:45.278 --> 01:44:47.547
THEY CAN BE GIVEN A REMOVAL

01:44:47.614 --> 01:44:47.781
ORDER.

01:44:47.848 --> 01:44:49.449
IT IS EXTREMELY STRESSFUL FOR

01:44:49.516 --> 01:44:51.251
THEM TO NOT HAVE OPTIONS.

01:44:51.318 --> 01:44:53.220
THE TRAINS ARE SOMETIMES AN

01:44:53.286 --> 01:44:53.820
OPTION IF THEY'RE HEARING IS

01:44:53.887 --> 01:44:55.555
LATER ON IN THE DAY BUT OFTEN

01:44:55.622 --> 01:44:57.391
TIMES THAT IS NOT THE CASE.

01:44:57.457 --> 01:44:59.593
THE SECOND HUGE OBSTACLE FOR THE

01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:01.328
KIDS OUR CHALLENGE IS THE

01:45:01.395 --> 01:45:03.330
EDUCATION SYSTEM.

01:45:03.397 --> 01:45:05.198
ESPECIALLY FOR THE TEEN YOUTH

01:45:05.265 --> 01:45:05.832
THE CHILDREN THAT WE WORK WITH

01:45:05.899 --> 01:45:07.601
MOST OFTEN HAVE VERY LIMITED

01:45:07.668 --> 01:45:09.236
EDUCATION.

01:45:09.302 --> 01:45:11.204
AND HAVE DIFFICULTY READING AND

01:45:11.271 --> 01:45:11.738
WRITING EVEN IN THEIR OWN

01:45:11.805 --> 01:45:13.340
LANGUAGE WHEN THEY COME TO OUR

01:45:13.407 --> 01:45:15.208
SCHOOLS THEY'RE PLACING CLASSES

01:45:15.275 --> 01:45:17.244
LIKE HISTORY AND PHYSICS.

01:45:17.310 --> 01:45:19.579
IN ENGLISH AND HAVE VERY LIMITED

01:45:19.646 --> 01:45:21.248
SUPPORT.

01:45:21.314 --> 01:45:21.848
AND WHEN THEY ARE IN THESE

01:45:21.915 --> 01:45:23.350
CLASSES THE OFTEN FAIL.

01:45:23.417 --> 01:45:25.419
WHICH REALLY AFFECTS YOUR SELF

01:45:25.485 --> 01:45:27.287
ESTEEM FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE

01:45:27.354 --> 01:45:29.423
ALREADY EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT

01:45:29.489 --> 01:45:31.391
LEVELS OF STRESS DUE TO TRAUMA

01:45:31.458 --> 01:45:33.260
BEING M. IMMIGRATION PROCEEDINGS.

01:45:33.326 --> 01:45:33.894
AND TRYING TO ADJUST TO THEIR

01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:35.362
NEW ENVIRONMENTS THIS IS

01:45:35.429 --> 01:45:37.597
DEVASTATING I HAVE WORKED WITH

01:45:37.664 --> 01:45:39.466
DOZENS OF CHILDREN WHO COMPLAIN

01:45:39.533 --> 01:45:41.234
OF STOMACH ACHES.

01:45:41.301 --> 01:45:43.203
HEADACHES AND DEPRESSION LINKED

01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:45.205
TO THEIR STRESSORS AT SCHOOL

01:45:45.272 --> 01:45:45.772
THIS CAN LEAD TO BEHAVIORAL

01:45:45.839 --> 01:45:47.574
PROBLEMS SUSPENSIONS AND POOR

01:45:47.641 --> 01:45:49.242
ATTENDANCE.

01:45:49.309 --> 01:45:51.344
WHEN YOUNG PERSON STRESS WAS SO

01:45:51.411 --> 01:45:51.845
SEVERE THAT SHE HAS HAD

01:45:51.912 --> 01:45:53.380
ATTEMPTED SUICIDE?

01:45:53.447 --> 01:45:55.515
BECAUSE SHE WAS ASKED TO READ AN

01:45:55.582 --> 01:45:57.417
ESSAY OUTLOUD IN ENGLISH AND

01:45:57.484 --> 01:45:59.252
FRONT OF HER PEERS.

01:45:59.319 --> 01:45:59.820
AND SHE SPENT A WEEK IN THE

01:45:59.886 --> 01:46:03.223
HOSPITAL. TO ADDRESS THIS I HAVE

01:46:03.290 --> 01:46:03.790
BEEN PARTNERING WITH SCHOOL

01:46:03.857 --> 01:46:05.358
DISTRICTS LIKE FRESNO UNIFIED

01:46:05.425 --> 01:46:07.260
MENDOTA UNIFIED.

01:46:07.327 --> 01:46:07.894
AND MODESTO UNIFIED AND GIVING

01:46:07.961 --> 01:46:09.463
PRESENTATIONS TO COUNSELORS

01:46:09.529 --> 01:46:11.331
ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNER STAFF

01:46:11.398 --> 01:46:13.266
AN ADMINISTRATOR.

01:46:13.333 --> 01:46:15.302
I WORK TO EDUCATE THEM ON

01:46:15.368 --> 01:46:17.237
UNACCOMPANIED IMMIGRANT STORIES

01:46:17.304 --> 01:46:17.838
AND PARTICULAR NEEDS AND TO

01:46:17.904 --> 01:46:19.606
CREATE REFERRAL SYSTEMS TO

01:46:19.673 --> 01:46:21.441
DIRECT CHILDREN TO STAFF THAT

01:46:21.508 --> 01:46:23.210
CAN GUIDE AND SUPPORT THEM

01:46:23.276 --> 01:46:25.245
THROUGH THE SCHOOL SYSTEM.

01:46:25.312 --> 01:46:27.547
THE THIRD IS A GENERAL LACK OF

01:46:27.614 --> 01:46:29.616
RESOURCES AND SERVICES FOR BASIC

01:46:29.683 --> 01:46:29.850
NEEDS.

01:46:29.916 --> 01:46:31.785
ANOTHER SOURCE OF STRESSES THAT

01:46:31.852 --> 01:46:33.620
THEY CANNOT WORK BUT THEY ARE

01:46:33.687 --> 01:46:35.422
EXPECTED TO PAY BACK HUGE DEBTS

01:46:35.489 --> 01:46:35.989
THAT THEY HAVE TO SUPPORT

01:46:36.056 --> 01:46:39.292
THEMSELVES SOMETIMES -- OR

01:46:39.359 --> 01:46:41.361
CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR HOUSEHOLDS

01:46:41.428 --> 01:46:41.995
SOMETIMES WE CAN CONNECT THEM

01:46:42.062 --> 01:46:45.398
WITH FOOD BANKS CLOTHING CLOSETS

01:46:45.465 --> 01:46:45.999
WERE SECURE DONATIONS THROUGH

01:46:46.066 --> 01:46:47.634
GIVE CARDS COATS OR SCHOOL

01:46:47.701 --> 01:46:49.369
SUPPLIES.

01:46:49.436 --> 01:46:51.338
HOWEVER THERE ARE TIMES WHEN

01:46:51.404 --> 01:46:53.340
FINDING THE SORCERER'S RESOURCES

01:46:53.406 --> 01:46:55.442
IS NOT VERY EASY. ONE CHILD THAT

01:46:55.509 --> 01:46:56.109
WE WORKED WITH TOOK A PHOTO OF

01:46:56.176 --> 01:46:57.544
HER EMPTY FRIDGE.

01:46:57.611 --> 01:46:59.679
AND THE CLOSEST -- FOOD BANK TO

01:46:59.746 --> 01:47:01.782
HER WAS FORTY FIVE MINUTES AWAY

01:47:01.848 --> 01:47:03.483
AND THERE WAS NO PUBLIC

01:47:03.550 --> 01:47:05.352
TRANSPORTATION TO GET THERE.

01:47:05.418 --> 01:47:05.986
AND THE PAST YEAR I HAVE ALSO

01:47:06.052 --> 01:47:07.721
HAD VARIOUS CLIENTS BECOME

01:47:07.788 --> 01:47:09.623
HOMELESS IT WAS NOT ONLY

01:47:09.689 --> 01:47:11.324
STRESSFUL INFORMATIK FOR THEM

01:47:11.391 --> 01:47:13.393
BUT ALSO EXTREMELY STRESSFUL FOR

01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:13.560
ME.

01:47:13.627 --> 01:47:15.662
AS A SCRAMBLE TO FIND THEMSELVES

01:47:15.729 --> 01:47:17.697
SAFE SHELTER IN AREAS WITHOUT

01:47:17.764 --> 01:47:18.031
MANY OPTIONS.

01:47:18.098 --> 01:47:19.800
HERE IN THE VALLEY THERE AREN'T

01:47:19.866 --> 01:47:21.735
VERY MANY SHELTERS FOR YOUTH IN

EIGHTEEN AND ONE TRANSITIONAL

01:47:27.707 --> 01:47:29.442
YOU SHELTER THAT IS NOT FULL

01:47:29.509 --> 01:47:31.344
TIME HAS A WAIT LIST MOST OF THE

01:47:31.411 --> 01:47:31.545
TIME.

01:47:31.611 --> 01:47:33.513
EARLIER THIS YEAR I HAVE TO

01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:34.147
CONNECT THE CLIENT TO SHELTER

01:47:34.214 --> 01:47:35.582
HOURS AWAY IN RICHMOND.

01:47:35.649 --> 01:47:37.517
IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY WHERE HIS

01:47:37.584 --> 01:47:39.352
ONLY CONNECTION WAS KIND STAFF

01:47:39.419 --> 01:47:41.354
HIS EYES GLAZED OVER IN HIS

01:47:41.421 --> 01:47:43.356
VOICE WAVERED AS I TOLD HIM THAT

01:47:43.423 --> 01:47:43.957
HE NEEDED TO RELOCATE. TO AN

01:47:44.024 --> 01:47:47.460
UNFAMILIAR AREA HE DID NOT KNOW.

01:47:47.527 --> 01:47:48.061
ANOTHER CLIENT WAS EIGHTEEN

01:47:48.128 --> 01:47:49.896
PREGNANT IN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:47:49.963 --> 01:47:51.464
SITUATION.

01:47:51.531 --> 01:47:53.500
WHERE SHE WAS SUFFERING FROM

01:47:53.567 --> 01:47:54.100
MENTAL EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL

01:47:54.167 --> 01:47:55.869
ABUSE SHE HAD BRUISES AND MARKS

01:47:55.936 --> 01:47:57.938

01:47:58.004 --> 01:47:59.739
LOCAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTER

01:47:59.806 --> 01:48:01.641
WHERE THEY INTERVIEWED HER FOR

01:48:01.708 --> 01:48:02.042
ALMOST AN HOUR?

01:48:02.108 --> 01:48:03.944
ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT THEY COULD

01:48:04.010 --> 01:48:05.812
NOT HELP HER BECAUSE THEY DID

01:48:05.879 --> 01:48:06.279
NOT HAVE CAPACITY.

01:48:06.346 --> 01:48:07.848
THEY GAVE HER A LIST OF SHELTERS

01:48:07.914 --> 01:48:09.749
IN OUR WAY BUT NO TRANSPORTATION

01:48:09.816 --> 01:48:13.520
OPTIONS TO GET THERE.

01:48:13.587 --> 01:48:14.120
ANOTHER BIG OBSTACLE FOR OUR

01:48:14.187 --> 01:48:15.856
CHILDREN IS THEIR OWN TRAUMA.

01:48:15.922 --> 01:48:17.791
THEY ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY

01:48:17.858 --> 01:48:19.626
SUFFERED FROM TRAUMA AND OTHER

01:48:19.693 --> 01:48:20.193
FORMS OF ADVERSE CHILDHOOD

01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:23.396
EXPERIENCES THAT CREATE.

01:48:23.463 --> 01:48:25.498
OR EXACERBATE.

01:48:25.565 --> 01:48:26.066
THEIR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

01:48:26.132 --> 01:48:29.502
ALL OF THE EARLIER CHALLENGES.

01:48:29.569 --> 01:48:31.571
I AM AN ADDITIONAL YOUTH ANXIETY

01:48:31.638 --> 01:48:33.506
AND STRESS CAN ALSO LEAD TO

01:48:33.573 --> 01:48:34.140
BEHAVIORAL ISSUES AND PROBLEMS

01:48:34.207 --> 01:48:35.642
THAT CAN MANIFEST IN PHYSICAL

01:48:35.709 --> 01:48:37.744
WAYS SUCH AS HEADACHE STOMACH

01:48:37.811 --> 01:48:39.446
ACHES TIREDNESS AND A LACK OF

01:48:39.512 --> 01:48:40.113
ABILITY TO CONCENTRATE AND FOCUS

01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:41.581
ON IMPORTANT TASKS.

01:48:41.648 --> 01:48:43.884
AND WORST CASE SCENARIO SELF

01:48:43.950 --> 01:48:44.084
HARM.

01:48:44.150 --> 01:48:45.652
CULTURAL STIGMA IN SEEKING

01:48:45.719 --> 01:48:47.587
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IS ALSO

01:48:47.654 --> 01:48:49.489
DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME.

01:48:49.556 --> 01:48:51.524
THE FOURTH CHALLENGE IS

01:48:51.591 --> 01:48:53.460
NAVIGATING THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

01:48:53.526 --> 01:48:55.462
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND DENTAL

01:48:55.528 --> 01:48:57.497
CARE -- SYSTEMS.

01:48:57.564 --> 01:48:59.532
IT IS DIFFICULT SOMETIMES --

01:48:59.599 --> 01:49:00.133
BECAUSE THERE'S A LONG WAIT

01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:01.935
LISTS NOT ENOUGH POSITIONS THAT

01:49:02.002 --> 01:49:03.904
SPEAK THE LANGUAGE ESPECIALLY

01:49:03.970 --> 01:49:05.872
WITH MENTAL HEALTH WHEN OUR KIDS

01:49:05.939 --> 01:49:07.674
ARE SPEAKING INDIGENOUS

01:49:07.741 --> 01:49:09.609
LANGUAGES ESPECIALLY -- WE

01:49:09.676 --> 01:49:11.845
REALLY HAVE A HARD TIME HERE AT

01:49:11.912 --> 01:49:13.780
HAVING THEM ACCESS THOSE

01:49:13.847 --> 01:49:15.849
SERVICES. ONE CHILD THAT I EXIT

01:49:15.916 --> 01:49:17.584
ASSISTED WAS TOLD BY A MEDICAL

01:49:17.651 --> 01:49:19.452

01:49:19.519 --> 01:49:20.053
FROM AN EYE INFECTION SHE HAD

01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:21.621
FOR HER HOME COUNTRY.

01:49:21.688 --> 01:49:23.657
IF SHE DID NOT REALLY -- RECEIVE

01:49:23.723 --> 01:49:25.558
IMMEDIATE ATTENTION THERE

01:49:25.625 --> 01:49:27.460
WEREN'T VERY MANY SPECIALISTS

01:49:35.635 --> 01:49:37.570
SPECIALIZED A SPECIALIST I WAS

01:49:37.637 --> 01:49:39.539

I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE

01:55:54.213 --> 01:55:54.714
THERE'S BOTH SIDES THERE'S A

01:55:54.781 --> 01:55:56.182
SIDE.

01:55:56.249 --> 01:55:56.716
YOU KNOW THAT SAY THAT.

01:55:56.783 --> 01:55:57.350
THEY MAY BE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF

01:55:57.417 --> 01:55:58.451
COMMUNITIES AND THEN THERE'S

01:55:58.518 --> 01:56:00.253
ANOTHER SITE THAT SAYS.

01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:02.221
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH LEGAL YOU

01:56:02.288 --> 01:56:04.324
KNOW ON COUNCILS OR OR ATTORNEYS

TO HELP IMMIGRATION VICTIMS SO

01:56:06.225 --> 01:56:08.161
WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHT ON THAT

01:56:08.227 --> 01:56:08.861
BECAUSE I LIKE I'M STRUGGLING TO

01:56:08.928 --> 01:56:10.530
UNDERSTAND WHETHER OR NOT IT'S

01:56:10.596 --> 01:56:14.300
GOOD OR BAD CAN YOU GIVE ME YOUR

01:56:14.367 --> 01:56:16.202
INSIGHT INTO THAT PLEASE.

01:56:16.269 --> 01:56:16.869
THE I A A CREDIT REPRESENTATIVES

01:56:16.936 --> 01:56:17.437
ARE GREAT BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:56:17.503 --> 01:56:18.638
TRAINED -- JUST SPECIFICALLY IN

01:56:18.705 --> 01:56:20.573
THIS AREA OF LAW WHICH IS

01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:22.542
IMMIGRATION -- AND I THINK THAT

01:56:22.608 --> 01:56:24.444
IT IS AN IMPORTANT.

01:56:24.510 --> 01:56:26.612
ASSET TO OUR COMMUNITIES TO HAVE

01:56:26.679 --> 01:56:28.214
THESE BA ACCREDITED AND

01:56:28.281 --> 01:56:30.149
DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS

01:56:30.216 --> 01:56:30.817
THROUGHOUT -- THE CENTRAL VALLEY

01:56:30.883 --> 01:56:32.485
WE ALREADY HAVE THEM AND WE'RE

01:56:32.552 --> 01:56:34.187
WORKING WITH THEM.

01:56:34.253 --> 01:56:36.456
AND THEY ARE OFTEN TRAINED AND

01:56:36.522 --> 01:56:38.658
AND ARE RECEIVING ENOUGH SUPPORT

01:56:38.725 --> 01:56:40.493
FROM THE ATTORNEYS THAT

01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:42.195
SUPERVISE THEM.

01:56:42.261 --> 01:56:44.197
I'M.

01:56:44.263 --> 01:56:46.165
WHAT I AM NOT IN FAVOR OF THE IS

01:56:46.232 --> 01:56:46.666
LIKE NOT THE IDEALS OR

01:56:46.733 --> 01:56:48.568
CONSULTANTS WHO DO NOT KNOW

01:56:48.634 --> 01:56:50.636
IMMIGRATION LAW IMMIGRATION LAWS

01:56:50.703 --> 01:56:54.440
EXTREMELY COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT

01:56:54.507 --> 01:56:56.309
EVEN FOR ATTORNEYS TO NAVIGATE?

01:56:56.376 --> 01:56:58.277
SO I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANYBODY

01:56:58.344 --> 01:57:00.446
WHO IS NOT TRAINED AND DOES NOT

01:57:00.513 --> 01:57:02.281
HAVE AN A SPECIFIC ACCREDITATION

01:57:04.350 --> 01:57:06.285
LAW OR GIVING ADVICE OF ANY KIND.

01:57:06.352 --> 01:57:06.919
SO AS LONG AS THEY HAVE SOME

01:57:06.986 --> 01:57:08.688
KIND OF IF THEY'RE UNDER THE

01:57:08.755 --> 01:57:12.258
WING OF A AN IMMIGRATION LAWYER --

01:57:12.325 --> 01:57:14.260
YOU THINK THAT THAT'S ADEQUATE

01:57:14.327 --> 01:57:16.396

01:58:12.452 --> 01:58:12.852
BEEN SOME FUNDING FOR

UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN.

01:58:14.487 --> 01:58:16.389
BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE MONEY

01:58:16.456 --> 01:58:18.458
HAS GONE TO THE BAY AREA OR TO

02:02:38.751 --> 02:02:40.853
LAST YEAR IN OUR STATE BUDGET WE

02:02:57.737 --> 02:02:58.671
PLACES.

02:02:58.738 --> 02:03:00.973
BECAUSE IT'S HARD FOR A LOT OF

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:02.842
OUR FAMILIES TO MAKE ENDS MEET

02:03:02.908 --> 02:03:03.442
AND ANYWAY WE CAN HELP WITH

02:03:03.509 --> 02:03:04.744
DIAPERS.

THEY ALWAYS COME BACK TO THE AND

02:03:20.793 --> 02:03:22.928

WHAT'S REALLY MISSING FROM THIS

STRUCTURAL RACISM.

AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS YOU KNOW

02:19:30.061 --> 02:19:30.662
IT'S THE MOST PERVASIVE FORM OF

02:19:30.729 --> 02:19:33.765
RACISM ON ITS SURFACE IT LOOKS

02:19:33.832 --> 02:19:36.067
VERY NEUTRAL -- BUT THERE'S

02:19:36.134 --> 02:19:38.069
REALLY A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE

02:19:38.136 --> 02:19:41.906
BETWEEN EQUITY AND A QUALITY.

02:19:41.973 --> 02:19:43.875
AND YOU KNOW A QUALITY MEANS

02:19:43.942 --> 02:19:46.010
THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO THE

02:19:46.077 --> 02:19:46.644
SAME RESOURCES BUT EQUITY MEANS

REALLY SHORT ON TIME SO I'M

02:39:31.561 --> 02:39:32.129
GOING TO FOCUS ON TWO ISSUES

02:39:32.195 --> 02:39:33.697
BECAUSE I DID -- EVERYTHING

02:39:33.764 --> 02:39:35.465

NOTARIES OR IMMIGRATION SERVICES.

02:39:41.538 --> 02:39:43.573

CERTIFIED TO DO.

02:39:47.611 --> 02:39:51.648
THE WORK THAT IS ILLEGAL IN THE

IMMIGRATION COMPONENT.

02:39:52.215 --> 02:39:55.519
OUR EXPERIENCE IS THAT

02:39:55.585 --> 02:39:55.819
[INAUDIBLE]

02:39:55.886 --> 02:39:57.854
UNLICENSED INDIVIDUALS TO DO.

02:39:57.921 --> 02:40:01.558
IMMIGRATION WORK.

02:40:01.625 --> 02:40:03.527
OFTEN LEADS INTO SERIOUS

02:40:03.593 --> 02:40:05.829
CONSEQUENCES FOR THE FAMILY.

02:40:05.896 --> 02:40:07.931
THEY END UP NOT BEING ELIGIBLE

02:40:07.998 --> 02:40:10.000
FOR WHAT THEY WERE APPLYING FOR

02:40:10.067 --> 02:40:11.969
THE END UP POTENTIALLY BEING DE

02:40:12.035 --> 02:40:15.572
PORTABLE OR DEPORTED.

02:40:15.639 --> 02:40:17.607
THEY ALSO END UP LOSING A LOT OF

02:40:17.674 --> 02:40:19.743
MONEY BECAUSE NOBODY ELSE ASK.

02:40:19.810 --> 02:40:21.645
A FEE UP AND I HAD A IN ADVANCE

02:40:21.712 --> 02:40:23.780

02:40:23.847 --> 02:40:25.582
DOLLARS WE KNOW THIS IS THE

02:40:25.649 --> 02:40:27.551
LIVED EXPERIENCE.

02:40:27.617 --> 02:40:28.185
SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:40:28.251 --> 02:40:29.653

02:40:29.720 --> 02:40:31.555
ON THIS.

02:40:31.621 --> 02:40:32.255
AND THEN THE OTHER IS I WANT TO

02:40:32.322 --> 02:40:35.592
TALK ABOUT THE CURRENT FEAR IN

02:40:35.659 --> 02:40:37.627
THE COMMUNITY ABOUT IMMIGRATION.

02:40:37.694 --> 02:40:39.796

THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN GENERAL.

03:04:35.531 --> 03:04:37.433
ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES AND WE

03:04:37.499 --> 03:04:39.134
DON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT THE LACK

03:04:39.201 --> 03:04:41.403
OF ACCESS TO BROADBAND AND WE

03:04:41.470 --> 03:04:41.937
DIDN'T GO INTO DEPTH ON

03:04:42.004 --> 03:04:43.272
TRANSPORTATION.

03:04:43.338 --> 03:04:45.340
BUT AS I WAS DRIVING HERE I

03:04:45.407 --> 03:04:47.209
THOUGHT ABOUT HOW WHEN I WAS

03:04:47.276 --> 03:04:49.211
FIRST IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY AND

03:04:49.278 --> 03:04:51.413
DRIVING DOWN HIGHWAY NINETY NINE

03:04:51.480 --> 03:04:52.014
ESPECIALLY IN THE WINTER TIME

03:04:52.080 --> 03:04:53.248
WHEN WAS FOGGY.

03:04:53.315 --> 03:04:55.384
YOU HAD TO REALLY BRACE YOURSELF

03:04:55.451 --> 03:04:55.984
IF YOU WERE TRYING TO CROSS

03:04:56.051 --> 03:04:57.619
HIGHWAY NINETY NINE BECAUSE AT

03:04:57.686 --> 03:04:59.221
THAT TIME WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE

03:04:59.288 --> 03:05:01.256
ANY OVER PASSES ARE UNDER PASSES

03:05:01.323 --> 03:05:03.492
WE HAD AT GRADE SEPARATIONS --

03:05:03.559 --> 03:05:05.561

TRY TO GET OVER TO THE OTHER

03:05:11.533 --> 03:05:13.268
SIDE OF THE FREEWAY.

03:05:13.335 --> 03:05:13.869
SO WE'VE COME A LONG WAY BUT

03:05:13.936 --> 03:05:15.537
THERE STILL ARE PARTS OF THE

03:05:15.604 --> 03:05:17.506
CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE WE FACE

03:05:17.573 --> 03:05:17.806
