00:34:17.388 --> 00:34:19.624
DOUBLES EVERY FEW YEARS.

IT'S HARDER AND HARDER TO KNOWS

00:34:21.192 --> 00:34:23.895
WHAT LEGAL AND ILLEGAL SO I JUST

00:34:23.961 --> 00:34:27.365

00:34:27.432 --> 00:34:27.932

RESTRAINING ORDERS.

00:34:46.451 --> 00:34:48.753

ADDRESS THIS POPULATION AND IT'S

00:34:51.756 --> 00:34:52.924
NOT ONLY THAT IT'S NOT ADEQUATE

00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:54.058
IT'S SIMPLY NOT THE MOST

00:34:54.125 --> 00:34:56.427
EFFICIENT WAY TO YOUR POINT OF

00:34:56.494 --> 00:34:56.994
HAVING TOO MANY LAWS ON THE

00:34:57.061 --> 00:34:57.795
BOOKS.

00:34:57.862 --> 00:34:58.996
THE GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING

00:34:59.063 --> 00:35:00.798
ORDER IS ASKING FOR PUZZLE

00:35:00.865 --> 00:35:03.935
PIECES TO BE DIG SIDE TOGETHER

00:35:04.001 --> 00:35:05.970
RATHER THAN STREAMLINING AND ARE

00:35:06.037 --> 00:35:07.438
USING AN EXISTING PROCESS.

00:35:07.505 --> 00:35:09.674
IF WE WERE TO SAY THAT OFFICERS

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.242
LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD RELY ON

00:35:11.309 --> 00:35:12.810
GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS

00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:14.078
THAT WOULD REQUIRE A COMPLETELY

00:35:14.145 --> 00:35:16.180
SEPARATE PROCESS TO BE PURSUED

00:35:16.247 --> 00:35:18.282
IN A COMPLETELY SEPARATE COURT --

00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:19.984
THE EIGHTY ONE TO PETITION THAT

00:35:20.051 --> 00:35:21.552

IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY.

ARE HEARD IN FAMILY COURT AND

00:35:26.858 --> 00:35:28.092
THE AB.

00:35:28.159 --> 00:35:29.894
PETITION PROCESS UNDER EIGHTY

00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:31.095
ONE OH TWO WOULD STILL HAVE TO

00:35:31.162 --> 00:35:32.330
HAPPEN.

00:35:32.396 --> 00:35:33.798
AND ON TOP OF THE GT R. O.

00:35:33.865 --> 00:35:35.299
BECAUSE OF THE CONFISCATION OF

00:35:35.366 --> 00:35:37.602
WEAPONS THAT OCCURS IN THE FIRST

00:35:37.668 --> 00:35:38.970
INSTANCE WHEN SOMEONE IS TAKEN

00:35:39.036 --> 00:35:40.204
INTO CUSTODY.

00:35:40.271 --> 00:35:42.540
ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY SO WHAT WE

00:35:42.607 --> 00:35:44.275
ARE PROPOSING IS SIMPLY USING

00:35:44.342 --> 00:35:46.210
THAT EXISTING PROCESS TO ADDRESS

00:35:46.277 --> 00:35:48.846
THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION THAT

00:35:48.913 --> 00:35:50.615
HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO CUSTODY.

00:35:50.681 --> 00:35:52.517
ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HAD THEIR

00:35:52.583 --> 00:35:53.985
GUNS CONFISCATED THERE'S THIS

00:35:54.051 --> 00:35:55.753
LOOPHOLE THAT ALLOWS THEM TO

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:56.521
THEM PURCHASE NEW GUIDANCE

00:35:56.587 --> 00:35:57.755
RATHER THAN ASKING LAW

00:35:57.822 --> 00:35:59.624
ENFORCEMENT AND AND DRAINING

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:01.626
THOSE PRECIOUS RESOURCES.

00:36:01.692 --> 00:36:03.127
THAT COULD BE PURSUING GUN

00:36:03.194 --> 00:36:04.662
VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS THAT

00:36:04.729 --> 00:36:05.963
ARE MORE NEEDED.

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:07.498
THIS ALLOWS THEM TO PROVE TO

00:36:07.565 --> 00:36:10.501
ACCOMPLISH WHAT THIS WHAT THE

00:36:10.568 --> 00:36:11.569
EXISTING LIGHTING ONE OH TWO

00:36:11.636 --> 00:36:13.037
INTENDS WHICH IS TO KEEP GUNS

00:36:13.104 --> 00:36:14.805
OUT OF THE HANDS OF SOMEONE.

00:36:14.872 --> 00:36:16.474
WHO'S BEEN FIFTY ONE FIFTIES AND

00:36:16.541 --> 00:36:20.511
HAVE THEIR GUNS CONFISCATED.

00:36:20.578 --> 00:36:21.879
SO.

00:36:21.946 --> 00:36:23.681
HAS THERE BEEN A YOU KNOW. TO

00:36:23.748 --> 00:36:24.448
THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S POINT

00:36:24.515 --> 00:36:26.317
THERE LAST TO PROCESS RIGHTS IN

00:36:26.384 --> 00:36:27.885
YOUR PROPOSE EACH.

00:36:27.952 --> 00:36:30.488
MECHANISM FOR EXAMPLE NOTICE

00:36:30.555 --> 00:36:32.456
RATE SO WHY DON'T HAVE YOU

00:36:32.523 --> 00:36:33.791
CONSIDERED PUTTING THE SAME DUE

00:36:33.858 --> 00:36:36.360
PROCESS RIGHTS INTO THIS PROCESS

00:36:36.427 --> 00:36:38.029
ARE USING THAT.

00:36:38.095 --> 00:36:38.963
EIGHTY ONE YES OUR OF OUR CAMP

ARE IN THE PROCESS OF

00:36:41.132 --> 00:36:42.333
CONSIDERING SEVERAL AMENDMENTS

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.968
AND THAT IS HIGH ON OUR LIST WE

00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:45.369
HAVE DRAFTED SOME LANGUAGE

00:36:45.436 --> 00:36:47.138
ALREADY TO INCLUDE A NOTICE

00:36:47.204 --> 00:36:48.739
THERE IS CURRENTLY A NOTICE.

00:36:48.806 --> 00:36:51.008
THAT IS MAILED ALREADY FOR THE

00:36:51.075 --> 00:36:52.577
CONFISCATION PIECE BECAUSE A

00:36:52.643 --> 00:36:54.345
PETITION IS FILED THAT TRIGGERS

00:36:54.412 --> 00:36:55.613
A NOTICE TO BE MAILED TO THE

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.915
PERSON IN ORDER TO RECEIVE.

00:36:57.982 --> 00:36:59.884
AN OPPORTUNITY REQUEST A HEARING

00:36:59.951 --> 00:37:01.218
ON THOSE GUNS THAT ERE

00:37:01.285 --> 00:37:03.087
CONFISCATED SO THIS WOULD SIMPLY

00:37:03.154 --> 00:37:05.122
BE AMENDING THAT NOTICE TO ALLOW

00:37:05.189 --> 00:37:07.158
THEM TO ALSO RECEIVE NOTICE THAT

00:37:07.224 --> 00:37:08.993
THERE ADD THIS PETITION PROCESS

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.461
IS ALSO REQUESTING A BAN ON

00:37:10.528 --> 00:37:12.296
OWNERSHIP FORGOTTEN. FOR GUNS

00:37:12.363 --> 00:37:15.800
FOR THIS PERSON FOR FIVE YEARS.

00:37:15.866 --> 00:37:16.467
AND IS THE STANDARD THE SAME IF

00:37:16.534 --> 00:37:17.935
SEEKING IT THROUGH THE OTHER

00:37:18.002 --> 00:37:19.470
PROCESSES THIS PROCESS.

00:37:19.537 --> 00:37:21.305
THIS STANDARD IN EIGHTY ONE OH

00:37:21.372 --> 00:37:23.374
TWO IS PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE

00:37:23.441 --> 00:37:24.942
AND I BELIEVE AND CLEAR AND

00:37:25.009 --> 00:37:26.544
CONVINCING FOR THE GUN VIOLENCE

00:37:26.611 --> 00:37:29.213
RESTRAINING ORDER -- SO THERE IS

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.448
THERE IS A DIFFERENT STANDARD

00:37:30.514 --> 00:37:32.016
BUT THAT IS ANOTHER AMENDMENT WE

00:37:32.083 --> 00:37:33.584
WOULD BE HAPPY TO CONSIDER OKAY

00:37:33.651 --> 00:37:34.518
YEAH BECAUSE I THINK THAT THIS

00:37:34.585 --> 00:37:35.553
BODY HAS SPENT A LOT OF TIME

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:37.622
WORKING TO MAKE SURE THE GUN

00:37:37.688 --> 00:37:38.589
VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER.

00:37:38.656 --> 00:37:41.525
BALANCE IS THE NEEDS OF THE GUN

00:37:41.592 --> 00:37:44.095
OWNER ANNE'S. TO BE SAFE AND THE

00:37:44.161 --> 00:37:46.130
GONNA BE SAFE IN THIS CASE BUT

00:37:46.197 --> 00:37:48.299
SO I THINK NEARING THOSE RATES

00:37:48.366 --> 00:37:50.001
WHILE USING A MORE EFFICIENT

00:37:50.067 --> 00:37:50.635
PROCESS WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE TO

00:37:50.701 --> 00:37:52.169
ME.

00:37:52.236 --> 00:37:52.903
I AGREE THOSE ARE CERTAINLY

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:54.772
AMENDMENTS WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO

00:37:54.839 --> 00:37:57.942
CONSIDER.

00:37:58.009 --> 00:37:58.409
DID YOU.

00:37:58.476 --> 00:37:59.977
AND IN I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE

00:38:00.044 --> 00:38:02.313
CONCERNS AB YOU KNOW GENERALLY

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.015
WHEN I HEAR THE WORD LOOPHOLE.

00:38:04.081 --> 00:38:05.549
I HEAR THAT IS AN END RUN AROUND

TO KIND OF STAY IN THAT LANE --

00:38:44.722 --> 00:38:46.924

00:39:02.106 --> 00:39:03.174
POINT OUT THAT.

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.775
REQUIRING TWO SEPARATE PROCESSES

00:39:04.842 --> 00:39:06.410
IN TWO SEPARATE COURTS IS ALSO A

00:39:06.477 --> 00:39:08.145
HINDRANCE ON DUE PROCESS RIGHTS

00:39:08.212 --> 00:39:09.513
BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PERSON

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:11.515
RESPONDING TO ALSO BE.

00:39:11.582 --> 00:39:12.083

THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY AND MY

00:39:27.131 --> 00:39:28.566
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT A G. B. R.

00:39:28.632 --> 00:39:30.167

POLICE EVALUATED HIM A

00:39:44.749 --> 00:39:45.950
DETERMINED HE DID NOT MEET THE

00:39:46.016 --> 00:39:48.619
CRITERIA FOR FIFTY ONE FIFTY AND

00:39:48.686 --> 00:39:49.420
AT THAT POINT BOTH LAW

00:39:49.487 --> 00:39:51.122

IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF MENTAL

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:00.097
ILLNESS.

00:40:00.164 --> 00:40:02.500

AS FAR AS MASS SHOOTINGS AND IS

00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:11.041
IF YOU LOOK AT MOST A MASS

00:45:11.108 --> 00:45:12.609
SHOOTING BUT I WOULDN'T TRY TO

00:45:12.676 --> 00:45:14.878
TAKE STIGMATIZE THAT GROUP OF

00:45:14.945 --> 00:45:15.946
PEOPLE.

AND TRY TO TAKE AWAY ALL OF

00:45:17.514 --> 00:45:20.017
THEIR GUNS THE ADS WOULD NOT.

00:45:20.084 --> 00:45:22.119
BE SOMETHING I WOULD WANT TO TO

00:45:22.186 --> 00:45:24.788
HAVE A QUE PROPOSED OR ANYTHING

00:45:24.855 --> 00:45:26.757

PROBLEMS BUT ON THE OTHER HAND --

00:45:30.694 --> 00:45:32.463
NO ONE WANTS TO BE THERE WHEN

OUT THERE.

00:45:39.903 --> 00:45:40.938

00:45:41.004 --> 00:45:42.840
THINK IS THE ROOT OF WHERE WE

00:45:42.906 --> 00:45:44.341

WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT COMES IN?

00:45:51.682 --> 00:45:52.149
IT TRIES TO MAKE THEIR JOB

00:45:52.216 --> 00:45:53.650
EASIER BY SHORTENING TO DUE

00:52:34.784 --> 00:52:36.520
THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM.

00:52:36.586 --> 00:52:38.855
TO BAD AB NINE OH SEVEN IS NOT

00:52:38.922 --> 00:52:40.724
THE SOLUTION.

00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:42.792
AB NINE OH SEVEN WOULD EXPAND

00:52:42.859 --> 00:52:44.027
THE CURRENT DEFINITION OF

00:52:44.094 --> 00:52:45.629
CRIMINAL THREATS AND CREATE A

00:52:45.695 --> 00:52:47.764
NEW CRIME OF CRIMINAL THREATS IN

THE CONTEXT OF THE SCHOOL OR

00:52:49.866 --> 00:52:52.702
PLACE OF RELIGIOUS WORSHIP.

00:52:52.769 --> 00:52:55.272
UP THE CURRENT STATUTE PENAL

00:52:55.338 --> 00:52:57.774
CODE FOR TWENTY TWO IS VERY

00:52:57.841 --> 00:53:00.577
PROBLEMATIC. FOR PUBLIC

00:53:00.644 --> 00:53:03.780
DEFENDERS AND THEIR CLIENTS THIS --

00:53:03.847 --> 00:53:07.918

PEOPLE WHO ARE INTENT UPON.

00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:18.662
CREATING FEAR AND MADE HIM.

00:53:18.728 --> 00:53:21.197
THE PEOPLE THIS HONEST PROPOSED

00:53:32.242 --> 00:53:33.677
EXAMPLES.

UNDER THE CURRENT STATUTE WITH

00:53:35.545 --> 00:53:36.846
THIS WOULD BE A FURTHER

00:53:36.913 --> 00:53:40.483
EXTENSION OF WE HAD A CLIENT ON

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:42.452
A ROGER WHO WAS A MARINE CORPS

00:53:42.519 --> 00:53:43.587

00:53:43.653 --> 00:53:46.523
HE SUFFERED FROM PTSD.

00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:50.694
HE CAME ON TO CALIFORNIA FROM

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.530
ANOTHER STATE.

00:53:53.597 --> 00:53:55.665
ANA WITHOUT SUFFICIENT MEDS FOR

00:53:55.732 --> 00:53:57.634
A CONVENTION HE WAS ATTENDING

00:53:57.701 --> 00:54:00.303
FOR VETERANS.

00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:02.739
HE DIDN'T BRING ENOUGH MEDS AND

00:54:02.806 --> 00:54:04.474
AS A RESULT TO HAVE THE EPISODE

00:54:04.541 --> 00:54:05.976
OF HEARING VOICES.

00:54:06.042 --> 00:54:08.011
AND SMELLING DEAD BODIES WHICH

00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:12.382
REQUIRED HIM TO ACTUALLY BE.

00:54:12.449 --> 00:54:13.950
FIFTY ONE FIFTY THE DOCTOR AT

00:54:14.017 --> 00:54:15.452
THE HOSPITAL SAID WELL YOUR

00:54:15.518 --> 00:54:16.987
SYMPTOMS DON'T MEET THE CRITERIA

00:54:17.053 --> 00:54:18.555

TO GET SOME HELP.

00:54:28.131 --> 00:54:30.433
AND THE DISCHARGE PLANNER JUST

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:32.669
TOLD THEM WHAT THE CRITERIA WAS

00:54:32.736 --> 00:54:33.803
AGAIN SO.

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:37.140
HE SHE SAID DANGER TO HIMSELF OR

00:54:37.207 --> 00:54:38.008
OTHERS.

00:54:38.074 --> 00:54:40.810
SO THE ROGER SAID WELL I'LL GET

00:54:40.877 --> 00:54:41.678

STAFF HOUSE THAT.

00:54:45.348 --> 00:54:46.916
SO THEY CALLED THE POLICE AND

00:54:46.983 --> 00:54:50.487
ARRESTED HIM FOR A FELONY.

00:54:50.553 --> 00:54:51.821
FOR TWENTY TWO OF TERRORIST

00:54:53.657 --> 00:55:00.230
FELONY AND IT'S A STRIKE -- THIS

00:55:00.296 --> 00:55:02.766
EXPERIENCE OF BEING OFF YOUR

00:55:02.832 --> 00:55:05.602
MEDS AND THEN JUST SAYING THINGS.

00:55:05.669 --> 00:55:07.871
ON FOR SOME PEOPLE IS NOT

00:55:07.937 --> 00:55:10.740
UNCOMMON WE HAD ANOTHER CLIENT

00:55:10.807 --> 00:55:12.475
WHO WAS IN HIS LATE FIFTIES.

00:55:12.542 --> 00:55:14.778
AND HE'S TOLD HIS FRIEND HE WAS

00:55:14.844 --> 00:55:16.613
GONNA BLOW THE BUILDING UP.

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:18.148
HIS FRIEND CALLD THE DEPARTMENT

00:55:18.214 --> 00:55:20.784

TWO DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY ACTION

00:55:36.032 --> 00:55:39.002
IT JUST REQUIRES WORDS.

00:55:39.069 --> 00:55:40.870
AND IT APPLIES EVEN IF THE

00:55:40.937 --> 00:55:42.605
PERSON WHO WAS SAYING THE WORDS

00:55:42.672 --> 00:55:43.873
HAS NO.

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:45.642
ACTUAL INTENT OF CARRYING OUT

00:55:45.709 --> 00:55:50.280
THE THREAT.

00:55:50.346 --> 00:55:52.248
OUR CONCERN IS THAT EXPANDING

00:55:52.315 --> 00:55:54.551
THE SCHOOL IN SNEER MORE PEOPLE

00:55:54.617 --> 00:55:56.419

00:55:56.486 --> 00:55:59.022
INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

00:55:59.089 --> 00:56:02.492
AND CERTAINLY A SYMPATHETIC TO

00:56:02.559 --> 00:56:04.794
THE INTENT BEHIND THE BILL.

GOOD MORNING CATHY SURE ON

00:56:12.802 --> 00:56:16.206
BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA --

00:56:16.272 --> 00:56:17.674
AND I WANT TO JOIN IN THIS

00:56:17.741 --> 00:56:19.743
GEORGE'S COMMENTS BUT I ALSO

00:56:19.809 --> 00:56:23.580
JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT -- FIRST

00:56:23.646 --> 00:56:24.581
FIRST THAT THIS IS.

00:56:24.647 --> 00:56:27.751
NOT A BILL ABOUT WHERE THERE IS

00:56:27.817 --> 00:56:29.185
AN ACTUAL ACT TO CARRY OUT THE

00:56:29.252 --> 00:56:30.787
THREAT.

00:56:30.854 --> 00:56:33.056
ON THE IT IS ONLY ABOUT THREATS

00:56:33.123 --> 00:56:34.924
AND NOT EVEN KNOW IT NECESSARILY

00:56:34.991 --> 00:56:36.659
THREATS WHERE THERE IS ANY

00:56:36.726 --> 00:56:39.095
INTENT TO CARRY OUT THE THREAT --

00:56:39.162 --> 00:56:41.531
BUT ALSO THAT THIS BILL IS IT'S

00:56:41.598 --> 00:56:43.333
NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO

00:56:43.399 --> 00:56:45.368
LESSEN THE NUMBER OF THREATS TO

00:56:45.435 --> 00:56:47.437
SCHOOLS AND PLACES OF WORSHIP --

00:56:47.504 --> 00:56:48.872
AND PLACES OF WORSHIP SIMPLY

00:56:48.938 --> 00:56:50.940
BECAUSE THE THREATS COVERED

00:56:51.007 --> 00:56:52.142
UNDER THE BILL CAN ALREADY BE

00:56:52.208 --> 00:56:54.611
PROSECUTED UNDER EXISTING LAW.

00:56:54.677 --> 00:56:56.045
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SO OVERCOME

00:56:56.112 --> 00:56:57.847
BY ANGER NOW THAT THEY MAKE

00:56:57.914 --> 00:56:58.515
THESE THREATS WITHOUT REGARD TO

00:56:58.581 --> 00:56:59.949
THE CONSEQUENCES ARE NOT GOING

00:57:00.016 --> 00:57:01.785
TO STOP BECAUSE THIS BILL HAS

00:57:01.851 --> 00:57:02.652
BEEN PASSED.

00:57:02.719 --> 00:57:04.087
IT'S NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO

00:57:04.154 --> 00:57:05.889
CHANGE THOSE CON THOSE POTENTIAL

00:57:05.955 --> 00:57:08.324
CONSEQUENCES. EIGHTY NINE OH

00:57:08.391 --> 00:57:10.727
SEVEN IS SIMPLY UNNECESSARY AND

00:57:10.794 --> 00:57:12.962
WE URGE AND HOPEFUL.

00:57:13.029 --> 00:57:14.097
THANK YOU ARE ANY OTHER

00:57:14.164 --> 00:57:17.033

EVERY FEW YEARS FOR THAT REASON

00:57:31.414 --> 00:57:33.416
I HAVE CONCERNS BECAUSE AGAIN

00:57:33.483 --> 00:57:34.551
IT'S ALREADY CRIME.

00:57:34.617 --> 00:57:37.253
THE D. A.'S REPRESENTATIVE SAID

00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:38.288
THAT THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO

00:57:38.354 --> 00:57:40.490
PROSECUTE THE CASE GIVEN HOW

00:57:40.557 --> 00:57:41.991
TOUGH THE CURRENT LAW IS THAT

00:57:42.058 --> 00:57:43.593
WAS PROBABLY GOOD REASON FOR IT

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:44.794
IN PARTICULAR.

00:57:44.861 --> 00:57:47.263
THE SUPREME COURT HAS IDENTIFIED

00:57:47.330 --> 00:57:49.999
CASES WHERE FOR EXAMPLE OF A

00:57:50.066 --> 00:57:52.569

00:57:58.308 --> 00:57:59.209
BOB.

00:57:59.275 --> 00:58:01.344
A THREAT THAT IT WAS -- EXERCISE

00:58:01.411 --> 00:58:03.213
OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT SO YOU

00:58:03.279 --> 00:58:04.647
ALSOHAVE THE DIFFICULTY THIS

00:58:04.714 --> 00:58:06.015
LAW MAY WERE INTO FIRST

00:58:06.082 --> 00:58:07.550
AMENDMENT PROBLEMS.

00:58:07.617 --> 00:58:11.688
SO I JUST DON'T THINK I CAN VOTE

00:58:11.754 --> 00:58:12.388
FOR THIS BILL [inaudible]

00:58:12.455 --> 00:58:15.258
THANK YOU [inaudible]

00:58:15.325 --> 00:58:16.526
KAMLAGER-DOVE.

00:58:16.593 --> 00:58:17.560
SO I TO WANT TO ECHO SOME OF THE

00:58:17.627 --> 00:58:19.162
CHALLENGES RAISED BY MY

00:58:19.229 --> 00:58:22.498
COLLEAGUE -- WE HAVE CLOSE TO

00:58:22.565 --> 00:58:23.132
SIX THOUSAND LAWS IN THE PENAL

00:58:23.199 --> 00:58:26.035
CODE -- AND SO I GET THAT WE ARE

00:58:26.102 --> 00:58:28.004
LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS I DON'T

00:58:28.071 --> 00:58:29.505
NECESSARILY KNOW THAT ALL OF THE

00:58:29.572 --> 00:58:31.474
SOLUTIONS ARE COMING FROM OR

00:58:31.541 --> 00:58:32.909
THROUGH PUBLIC SAFETY SOME OF

00:58:32.976 --> 00:58:34.577
THE SOLUTIONS ARE FAR MORE

00:58:34.644 --> 00:58:36.412
UNCOMFORTABLE.

00:58:36.479 --> 00:58:37.680
AND NEBULOUS AND NUANCED.

00:58:37.747 --> 00:58:39.249
AROUND.

00:58:39.315 --> 00:58:40.817
MAYBE THIS COUNTRY BEING.

00:58:40.884 --> 00:58:42.418
IN THE MIDST OF A MENTAL HEALTH

00:58:42.485 --> 00:58:44.954
EPIDEMIC AND NONE OF US REALLY

00:58:45.021 --> 00:58:46.589
ADEQUATELY KNOWING HOW TO DEAL

00:58:46.656 --> 00:58:50.426
WITH TRAUMA -- THERE IS A COLD

00:58:50.493 --> 00:58:51.794
PENAL CODE FOR TWO TWO IS

00:58:51.861 --> 00:58:53.596
ALREADY ON THE BOOKS THIS IS

00:58:53.663 --> 00:58:55.331
REALLY DUPLICATIVE LANGUAGE.

00:58:55.398 --> 00:58:57.300
THE LAW THAT'S CURRENTLY ON THE

00:58:57.367 --> 00:58:59.102
BOOKS SAYS YOU CANNOT DO ANY OF

00:58:59.168 --> 00:59:00.570
THESE AGAINST A PERSON.

00:59:00.637 --> 00:59:02.071
THIS WOULD ACTUALLY SAY YOU

00:59:02.138 --> 00:59:05.408
CAN'T DO THIS -- STATE A KIND OF

00:59:05.475 --> 00:59:07.443
THREAT AGAINST A PLACE.

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:09.112
YOU KNOW WE ARE SORT OF MOVING

00:59:09.178 --> 00:59:10.513
THE NEEDLE.

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:13.149
FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY -- AND

00:59:13.216 --> 00:59:14.951
REALLY.

00:59:15.018 --> 00:59:16.386
THE BAR FOR PROSECUTION IS SO

00:59:16.452 --> 00:59:18.354
LOW AND I JUST GET CONCERNED

00:59:18.421 --> 00:59:19.522
THAT WE'RE FIGURING OUT WAYS TO

00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:21.958
CHIP AWAY AT THAT ALREADY LOW

00:59:22.025 --> 00:59:24.894
THRESHOLD -- AND AND WHERE WE'RE

00:59:24.961 --> 00:59:26.663
TRYING TO END UP I DON'T KNOW.

00:59:26.729 --> 00:59:29.332
I I QUESTION KIND OF IF YOU HEAR

00:59:29.399 --> 00:59:31.434
SOMETHING SOME KIND OF THREAT

00:59:31.501 --> 00:59:32.769
BEING SAID.

00:59:32.835 --> 00:59:33.770
YOU KNOW YOU ALSO HAVE TO THINK

00:59:33.836 --> 00:59:35.805
ABOUT WHO WAS THE RECIPIENT WHO

00:59:35.872 --> 00:59:37.340
WAS THE PERSON HEARING THAT AND

00:59:37.407 --> 00:59:38.908
HOW ARE THEY HEARING IT AND HOW

00:59:38.975 --> 00:59:40.376
ARE THE INTERPRETING IT.

00:59:40.443 --> 00:59:42.111
SO NOW ARE WE BASING LAWS BASED

00:59:42.178 --> 00:59:43.579
ON HOW SOMEONE INTERPRETS WHAT

00:59:43.646 --> 00:59:44.547
THEY HEAR.

00:59:44.614 --> 00:59:46.082
WE'RE ALSO NOT TAKING INTO

00:59:46.149 --> 00:59:50.286
CONSIDERATION -- WHAT HAPPENS

00:59:50.353 --> 00:59:50.586
[inaudible]

00:59:50.653 --> 00:59:52.088
SO.

00:59:52.155 --> 00:59:53.456
EIGHTY YOU CAN I BRING FIREARMS

00:59:53.523 --> 00:59:54.657
TO A SCHOOL YOU CANNOT BRING

00:59:54.724 --> 00:59:56.225
DRUGS YOU CAN I BRING MAYES YOU

00:59:56.292 --> 00:59:58.194
CANNOT BRING KNIVES WE MAY GET

00:59:58.261 --> 00:59:59.362
TO A POINT WHERE PEOPLE AREN'T

00:59:59.429 --> 01:00:01.564
EVEN BRINGING BOOKS -- BUT THOSE

01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:04.133
THINGS ARE ALREADY ILLEGAL.

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.836
AND THEN WE HAVE TO HAVE REAL

01:00:06.903 --> 01:00:09.472
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW STUDENTS

01:00:09.539 --> 01:00:11.341
ARE ACTUALLY BEING TREATED.

01:00:11.407 --> 01:00:13.309
AT SCHOOLS IF BULLYING IS

01:00:13.376 --> 01:00:14.978
HAPPENING IF THEY'RE BEING

01:00:15.044 --> 01:00:17.847
HARASSED BY MAYBE EVEN PEOPLE

01:00:17.914 --> 01:00:19.315
WHO WORK AT THE SCHOOLS.

01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:20.616
AND IF THEY'RE SAYING THESE

01:00:20.683 --> 01:00:22.085
KINDS OF THINGS BECAUSE THEY

01:00:22.151 --> 01:00:23.753
DON'T REALLY HAVE ANOTHER WAY TO

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:25.722
COMMUNICATE AND THEY'RE ANGRY

01:00:25.788 --> 01:00:27.323
AND THEY'RE SCARED AND WE'RE NOT

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:29.258
REALLY TALKING ABOUT BULLYING.

01:00:29.325 --> 01:00:31.527
WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT WAYS TO

01:00:31.594 --> 01:00:34.197
ONCE AGAIN A RACE THE LIGHT THAT

01:00:34.263 --> 01:00:35.832
IS DUE PROCESS.

01:00:35.898 --> 01:00:37.166
AND FIGURING OUT WAYS TO

01:00:37.233 --> 01:00:39.035
INCARCERATE SO MANY PEOPLE AND

01:00:39.102 --> 01:00:40.169
WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING PEOPLE IN

01:00:40.236 --> 01:00:42.605
BOXES FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND

01:00:42.672 --> 01:00:44.540
IT'S NOT WORKING THIS IS NOT

01:00:44.607 --> 01:00:46.576
ANSWERING THE QUESTION.

01:00:46.642 --> 01:00:49.712
ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE.

01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:51.447
WE CAN USE.

01:00:51.514 --> 01:00:52.882
FOR TWO TO PEOPLE GET LOCKED UP

01:00:52.949 --> 01:00:55.184
MANY A TIME MANY A DAY BECAUSE

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:57.120
OF THAT CODE.

01:00:57.186 --> 01:01:00.123
I THINK WE HAVE THE TOOLS ON THE

01:01:00.189 --> 01:01:01.557
BOOKS ALREADY.

01:01:01.624 --> 01:01:03.059
AND I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE JUST

01:01:03.126 --> 01:01:04.494
TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO USE THE

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:05.895
TOOLS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE IN

01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:07.697
THE CODE RATHER THAN TRYING TO

01:01:07.764 --> 01:01:09.866
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO PUT EVERY

01:01:09.932 --> 01:01:11.834
PERSON IN JAIL THAT WERE AFRAID

01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:12.135
UP.

01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:13.503
AND WE'RE TOO UNCOMFORTABLE TO

01:01:13.569 --> 01:01:14.837
HELP.

01:01:14.904 --> 01:01:16.005
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:17.407
AMENDMENTS WOULD LOOK LIKE BUT

01:01:17.473 --> 01:01:19.876
I'M ACTUALLY INTERESTED IN BILLS

01:01:19.942 --> 01:01:21.444
THAT TALK ABOUT THOSE ISSUES.

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:23.579
AND AS A RESULT OF THAT I AM NOT

01:01:23.646 --> 01:01:25.448
GOING TO BE ABLE TO SORT PART

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:26.516
THIS BILL [inaudible]

01:01:26.582 --> 01:01:28.818
YES [inaudible]

01:01:28.885 --> 01:01:31.454
BUT NO [inaudible]

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:33.689
OKAY.

01:01:33.756 --> 01:01:35.458
SO I THINK YOU KNOW YOU REYES

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:37.060
SORT OF A MUCH LARGER POINT THAN

01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:38.428
JUST THIS BILL ABOUT PEOPLE WITH

01:01:38.494 --> 01:01:39.695
MENTAL ILLNESS BEING TAKEN IN

01:01:39.762 --> 01:01:41.197
OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

01:01:41.264 --> 01:01:42.265
INSTEAD OF INTO THE CARE THAT

01:01:42.331 --> 01:01:44.233
THEY DESERVE AND NEED AND SHOULD

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.568
BE TREATED.

01:01:45.635 --> 01:01:47.470
TO AND I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:48.771
THAT WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING IS

01:01:48.838 --> 01:01:49.772
THAT.

01:01:49.839 --> 01:01:50.606
THERE SHOULD BE A SEPARATE

01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:51.808
AVENUE FOR THOSE THAT ARE

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:52.608
SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS

01:01:52.675 --> 01:01:54.310
RATHER THAN WE LACK THAT

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:55.645
TREATMENT RIGHT NOW AND SO.

01:01:55.711 --> 01:01:56.913
THEY ARE BEING.

01:01:56.979 --> 01:01:57.880
PICKED UP BY THE POLICE THEIR

01:01:57.947 --> 01:01:59.549
BEEN PUT INTO JAILS AND SEVEN TO

01:01:59.615 --> 01:02:01.284
MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES AND I

01:02:01.350 --> 01:02:03.486
THINK THAT IS A LARGER QUESTION.

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:04.720
THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THROUGH

01:02:04.787 --> 01:02:05.688
HEALTHCARE AND THROUGH MENTAL

01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:07.423
HEALTH CARE IN MAKING SURE THAT

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:09.692
PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE RESOURCES

01:02:09.759 --> 01:02:11.027
THEY NEED TO BE TREATED AND NOT.

01:02:11.094 --> 01:02:13.362
CRIMINALIZED FOR MENTAL ILLNESS

01:02:13.429 --> 01:02:15.865
THAT BEING SAID YOU KNOW I SEE

01:02:15.932 --> 01:02:18.101
EVERY DAY THE RISE IN THESE KIND

01:02:18.167 --> 01:02:19.502
OF THREATS.

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:21.404
TO YOU KNOW MY OWN SYNAGOGUE AND

01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:23.106
WE HEAR THAT OUR LOCAL SCHOOLS

01:02:23.172 --> 01:02:26.275
AND YOU KNOW WE DO.

01:02:26.342 --> 01:02:27.977
I AM OF THE OPINION THAT WE NEED

01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:29.579
TO BE GIVING LAW ENFORCEMENT THE

01:02:29.645 --> 01:02:31.414
TOOLS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE SAFE

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:32.715
AND OUR PLACES OF WORSHIP.

01:02:32.782 --> 01:02:35.651
IN OUR SCHOOLS BECAUSE WHEN I

01:02:35.718 --> 01:02:36.185
DROP MY KIDS OFF TO SUNDAY

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:37.620
SCHOOL.

01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:38.221
OR TO SCHOOL IN THE MORNING.

01:02:38.287 --> 01:02:39.222
THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE

01:02:39.288 --> 01:02:41.424
SAFEST PLACE FOR ME TO TAKE THEM.

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:45.094
AND CURRENTLY IT ISN'T.

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:46.262
THANK YOU.

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:47.797
AND YOU MAKE CLOSE.

01:02:47.864 --> 01:02:49.532
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I DO

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:50.733
WANT TO REITERATE THANK YOU TO

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.136
THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR ATTENTION.

01:02:53.202 --> 01:02:54.604
THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN TO THIS AND

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:56.806
THE HARD WORK THAT YOU OF PUT IN

01:02:56.873 --> 01:02:58.674
TO WITH MY STAFF AND I DO ACCEPT

01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:00.209
THE AMENDMENTS HAS PROPOSED AS

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:02.278
PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE -- IT

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:04.447
IS UNFORTUNATE OF THE GROSS

01:03:04.514 --> 01:03:06.149
GENERALIZATION OF THIS SUBJECT

01:03:06.215 --> 01:03:08.384
BY A COLLEAGUE ON THE COMMITTEE --

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:10.953
BECAUSE IT'S NOT -- THE SAME AS

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:12.655
THE LAW THAT EXIST IT DOES

01:03:12.722 --> 01:03:15.258
EXPAND IT TO SCHOOLS AND TO

01:03:15.324 --> 01:03:16.626
PLACES OF WORSHIP.

01:03:16.692 --> 01:03:19.562
THE DIFFERENCE IS IS THAT IF I

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:20.496
MAKE A THREAT TO JOHNNY.

01:03:20.563 --> 01:03:22.298
THAT IS PROSECUTABLE BUT IF I

01:03:22.365 --> 01:03:26.402
MAKE A THREAT. TO TO A JEWISH

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:27.436
SYNAGOGUE.

01:03:27.503 --> 01:03:29.672
THEN I AM NOT PROSECUTED NIGHT

01:03:29.739 --> 01:03:31.674
DO HAVE A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF

01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:33.409
HOW THAT TOOK PLACE AND MY

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:34.477
DISTRICT.

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:36.846
AND IS FAR AS MENTAL HEALTH IS

01:03:36.913 --> 01:03:39.715
CONCERNED -- AND THE ARGUMENT --

01:03:39.782 --> 01:03:41.784
BY THE OPPOSITION AND I

01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:43.452
APPRECIATE AND RESPECTFULLY --

01:03:43.519 --> 01:03:46.222
WANT TO ADDRESS THAT AS FAR AS

01:03:46.289 --> 01:03:48.357
IF THE ARGUMENT IS THIS BILL

01:03:48.424 --> 01:03:52.595
DOESN'T STOP THREATS. TO SCHOOLS

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:54.130
INTO PLACES OF WORSHIP WELL THE

01:03:54.197 --> 01:03:55.865
BILL ALREADY EXIST IN THE FORM

01:03:55.932 --> 01:03:57.533
OF LAW IN THIS SENSE OF

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.001
INDIVIDUALS.

01:03:59.068 --> 01:04:00.503
THEN I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THE

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:01.504
SAME ARGUE WOULD BE WITH THE

01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:03.973
OPPOSITION THAT THE CURRENT BILL

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.741
DOESN'T STOP THREATS AGAINST

01:04:05.808 --> 01:04:07.176
INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR APPS TO

01:04:07.243 --> 01:04:08.578
WRITE IT DOESN'T STOP IT.

01:04:08.644 --> 01:04:10.012
BUT IT DOES ALLOW US TO TAKE

01:04:10.079 --> 01:04:12.582
ACTION AGAINST IT AND MAKE IT --

01:04:12.648 --> 01:04:14.650
CONSEQUENTIAL AND WHAT THIS BILL

01:04:14.717 --> 01:04:16.986
WILL DO THOUGH IT MAY NOT STOP A

01:04:17.053 --> 01:04:19.322
THREAT WHAT THIS BILL WILL DO IS

01:04:19.388 --> 01:04:20.723
MAKE A CONSEQUENTIAL.

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:22.024
AND YOU CAN'T JUST STAND UP IN

01:04:22.091 --> 01:04:23.926
AN AIRPORT AND OUT OF ANGER SAY

01:04:23.993 --> 01:04:25.861
ON A BLOW THIS PLACE UP.

01:04:25.928 --> 01:04:27.597
AND EXPECT TO WALK OUT FREE AND

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:29.999
THE SAME THING I BELIEVE IS THAT

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:31.867
EVEN IN YOUR MIDST OF ANGER.

01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:33.536
AND AND FOR SOMEONE AS A

01:04:33.603 --> 01:04:34.737
CHAPLAIN OF THE CONCORD POLICE

01:04:34.804 --> 01:04:36.939
DEPARTMENT SITTING IN THE FRONT

01:04:37.006 --> 01:04:38.874
SEAT OF THAT CAR LISTENING THE

01:04:38.941 --> 01:04:40.209
FIRST RESPONDERS.

01:04:40.276 --> 01:04:43.179
ACTUALLY GOING AND AND HOPING

01:04:43.246 --> 01:04:44.947
AND WORKING WITH VICTIMS OF

01:04:45.014 --> 01:04:47.116
SCHOOLS THAT HAD TO GO TO SCHOOL

01:04:47.183 --> 01:04:48.417
UNDER A THREAT.

01:04:48.484 --> 01:04:50.519
THAT -- I SEE THE CONSEQUENCE OF

01:04:50.586 --> 01:04:52.388
THAT THREAT AND SO ALL I'M

01:04:52.455 --> 01:04:55.057
ASKING FOR IS THAT WE MAKE SURE

01:04:55.124 --> 01:04:57.026
THAT IF SOMEONE DOES NEED THE

01:04:57.093 --> 01:04:59.362
HELP THAT WE HAVE THIS TOOL IF

01:04:59.428 --> 01:05:01.764
IT'S A MENTAL ISSUE -- AND

01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:03.165
MENTAL HEALTH -- PRESCRIPTIONS

01:05:03.232 --> 01:05:05.468
REQUIRED THEN THIS PROCESS COULD

01:05:05.534 --> 01:05:08.237
VERY WELL HOPE SOME FOLKS THAT

01:05:08.304 --> 01:05:09.472
WOULD HAVE NEVER RECEIVED HELP.

01:05:09.538 --> 01:05:11.707
FIND THEMSELVES IN A PLACE THAT

01:05:11.774 --> 01:05:12.808
ELENA RHETORIC HOPE IS BEING

01:05:12.875 --> 01:05:13.743
RECEIVED.

01:05:13.809 --> 01:05:16.279
SO ALL I ASK FOR IS THAT WE LOOK

01:05:16.345 --> 01:05:17.713
AT WHAT CURRENTLY EXIST.

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:22.451
AND EXPAND THAT TO BE ABLE TO

01:05:22.518 --> 01:05:23.519
SAY THAT IF YOU DON'T NAME THE

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:24.687
PERSON BUT YOU ACTUALLY NAME THE

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:24.920
PLACE.

01:05:24.987 --> 01:05:27.023
THEN THAT COUNTS AS WELL.

01:05:27.089 --> 01:05:29.125
WAS BY WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY

01:05:29.191 --> 01:05:29.759
ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

01:05:29.825 --> 01:05:31.661
AND THANK YOU AND I THANK YOU

01:05:37.166 --> 01:05:38.134
WITH YOU SO WE COULD.

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:41.904
WORK OUT A LOT OF THE ISSUES OF

01:05:41.971 --> 01:05:43.072
I JUST.

01:05:43.139 --> 01:05:44.573
WOULD LIKE TO JUST MAKE ONE

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:45.207
RECOMMENDATION THERE'S THERE'S A

01:05:45.274 --> 01:05:47.777
TERM OF ART OR IS A TERM THAT'S

01:05:47.843 --> 01:05:48.411
USED.

AMONG PEOPLE HERE -- WHICH IS --

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.648
THROUGH THE CHAIR AND THE REASON

FOR THAT IS NONE OF THESE

01:05:54.417 --> 01:05:57.019
COMMENTS ARE PERSONALLY TOWARD

01:05:57.086 --> 01:05:58.421

01:05:58.487 --> 01:05:59.555
FOR ANOTHER COMMITTEE IS NOT

TOWARD ANOTHER WITNESS -- AND

01:06:01.524 --> 01:06:02.992
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY TO THE CHAIR

01:06:03.059 --> 01:06:06.028
SO HOPEFULLY -- AT WHICH I

01:06:06.095 --> 01:06:07.530
PROBABLY SHOULD SOME OTHER

01:06:07.596 --> 01:06:09.365
WITNESSES WHO REALLY GET.

01:06:09.432 --> 01:06:11.267

01:06:22.378 --> 01:06:24.113
DURING THE ANALYSIS.

THE HARD COPIES.

01:06:26.482 --> 01:06:28.184

ALL RIGHT MAYBE I DON'T HAVE THE

01:06:29.385 --> 01:06:31.654
MOST RECENT COPY.

01:06:31.721 --> 01:06:34.323
THE ONLY THING THAT PUTS TO THE

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:35.991
SYSTEM ARE THE ACTUAL AMOUNT YOU

01:06:36.058 --> 01:06:37.660

EVERYONE ELSE.

01:36:12.366 --> 01:36:13.834
THAT MIGHT DO A TRANSACTION AT A

01:36:13.901 --> 01:36:15.402
STORE FRONT -- ONE OF THE

01:36:15.469 --> 01:36:17.271
CONCERNS OVER THE YEARS -- AND

01:36:17.338 --> 01:36:19.173
CONTINUES TO BE A CONCERN IF YOU

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:22.443
DON'T PROVIDE A VENUE FOR A

01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:24.378
PRIVATE PARTY TRANSFERS I'VE

01:36:24.445 --> 01:36:26.080
THERE'S AN ESTATE SALE SOMETHING

01:36:26.147 --> 01:36:27.548
LIKE THAT THE GUN SHOW BECOMES A

01:36:27.615 --> 01:36:29.316
PRETTY USEFUL VENUE FOR THE OUT

01:36:29.383 --> 01:36:30.885
LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE PAST IT'S

01:36:30.951 --> 01:36:32.019
BEEN CONCERNED.

01:36:32.086 --> 01:36:33.921
ABOUT THE BANNING OF GUN SHOWS

01:36:33.988 --> 01:36:34.855
WHICH WOULD DRIVE THE

01:36:34.922 --> 01:36:37.424
UNDERGROUND -- SELL SELLING OF

01:36:37.491 --> 01:36:39.493
FIREARMS AND THAT ALSO WAS

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:40.261
POINTED OUT IN THE UC DAVIS

01:36:40.327 --> 01:36:41.162
STUDY.

01:36:41.228 --> 01:36:42.796
IN ADDITION -- I NOTE THAT THIS

01:36:42.863 --> 01:36:44.532
IS STATE PROPERTY AND THAT MEANS

01:36:44.598 --> 01:36:46.333
THAT THE TAXPAYERS HAVE ACCESS

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:48.169
TO IT THERE ARE FIRST AND SECOND

01:36:48.235 --> 01:36:50.371
AMENDMENT ISSUES WITH THIS.

01:36:50.437 --> 01:36:51.672
AND I NOTICED THE WITNESS IN

01:36:51.739 --> 01:36:53.807
SUPPORT TALKED ABOUT CONCERTS

01:36:53.874 --> 01:36:55.376
YES OUR CONCERTS AT THOSE BEEN

01:36:55.442 --> 01:36:57.645
USE THOSE OCCUR AT NIGHT AND I

01:36:57.711 --> 01:36:58.245
THINK IF YOU CHECK THE RECORD

01:36:58.312 --> 01:36:58.879
YOU'LL SEE.

01:36:58.946 --> 01:37:00.481
THERE ARE MANY MORE LAW

01:37:00.548 --> 01:37:06.220
ENFORCEMENT CALLS ON THINGS THAT

01:37:06.287 --> 01:37:08.455
GO WRONG IT CONCERTS. FOR

01:37:08.522 --> 01:37:10.191
EXAMPLE -- THE ANALYSIS ALSO

01:37:10.257 --> 01:37:10.791
DOES POINT OUT -- THAT THERE

01:37:10.858 --> 01:37:11.392
THERE IS A LAWSUIT PENDING IN

01:37:11.458 --> 01:37:11.859
THE FEDERAL COURT ON

01:37:11.926 --> 01:37:12.726
CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THIS AND

01:37:12.793 --> 01:37:14.028
THE BOARD DOES HAVE THIS UNDER

01:37:14.094 --> 01:37:15.863
REVIEWS SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE

01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:17.932

01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:45.579
I MAKE A MOTION OF THE BILL

01:44:45.646 --> 01:44:45.879
[inaudible]

01:44:45.946 --> 01:44:47.347
THIS.

01:44:47.414 --> 01:44:49.683
YEAH SO I YOU KNOW I JUST WANT

01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:51.918
TO SAY THAT I I DON'T KNOW THAT

01:44:51.985 --> 01:44:53.220
I THINK THAT THIS IS A HUMAN

01:44:53.286 --> 01:44:54.955
TRAFFICKING BILL I FEEL LIKE

01:44:55.022 --> 01:45:00.027
THIS IS A FUNDING BILL -- AND

01:45:00.093 --> 01:45:02.996
IT'S A BUDGET BILL MASKING AS A

01:45:03.063 --> 01:45:04.998
POLICY BILL AND I WOULD WONDER

01:45:05.065 --> 01:45:07.567
WHY THIS HASN'T GONE THROUGH --

01:45:07.634 --> 01:45:09.803
BUDGET SUBDIALECTS T. YOU KNOW

01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:10.971
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE LAWS ON THE

01:45:11.038 --> 01:45:12.339
BOOKS AS IT RELATES TO HUMAN

01:45:12.406 --> 01:45:14.708
TRAFFICKING -- AND ALSO SEX

01:45:14.775 --> 01:45:18.345
TRAFFICKING -- AND JUST ALSO

01:45:18.412 --> 01:45:19.980
QUESTION WHY.

01:45:20.047 --> 01:45:23.250
IT'S ALL FUNDING FOR A DISTRICT

01:45:23.316 --> 01:45:25.452
ATTORNEY'S OFFICES BUT ALSO NO

01:45:25.519 --> 01:45:27.421
FUNDING -- FOR PUBLIC DEFENDERS

01:45:27.487 --> 01:45:28.455
AND I KNOW THAT WAS IN THE

01:45:28.522 --> 01:45:30.123
ANALYSIS I DON'T KNOW IF MEANT

01:45:30.190 --> 01:45:31.625
THAT WAS ADDRESSED OR IF THERE'S

01:45:31.692 --> 01:45:33.994
SOME AMENDMENTS OR IF THAT'S

01:45:34.061 --> 01:45:34.828
BEEN ADDRESS.

01:45:34.895 --> 01:45:37.898
SO THE REASON THAT THIS BILL IS --

01:45:37.964 --> 01:45:39.499
HERE FIRST AND NINE AND BUDGETS

01:45:39.566 --> 01:45:41.535
OF FIVE IS BECAUSE THAT'S HOW

01:45:41.601 --> 01:45:43.437
THE THE BILL WAS CUTE ON THAT

01:45:43.503 --> 01:45:44.871
WASN'T UP TO ME IF I HAD MY

01:45:44.938 --> 01:45:47.741
DECISION AS TO WHERE THE BILL

01:45:47.808 --> 01:45:48.341
WOULD GO WOULD GO STRAIGHT TO

01:45:48.408 --> 01:45:49.142
THE FLOOR.

01:45:49.209 --> 01:45:51.078
BUT THIS BILL IS IN THE PUBLIC

01:45:51.144 --> 01:45:53.346
SAFETY COMMITTEE -- AS FAR AS

01:45:53.413 --> 01:45:55.816
THE FINDING THIS IS HOW WE THIS

01:45:55.882 --> 01:45:57.050
IS HOW THIS THIS BILL WAS

01:45:57.117 --> 01:45:58.685
STRUCTURE IN THE PAST -- THIS

01:45:58.752 --> 01:45:59.920

01:46:04.725 --> 01:46:06.193
FUNDING ATTACHED TO THIS THIS

01:46:06.259 --> 01:46:07.961
HAS BEEN THE CASE ALL ALONG

01:46:08.028 --> 01:46:09.896
WHICH HAS BEEN APPROPRIATED MY

01:46:09.963 --> 01:46:11.031
MIND INTERNAL SAYS MIND HE WAS

01:46:11.098 --> 01:46:12.733
VOTED FOR IT -- WE COULD

01:46:12.799 --> 01:46:14.034
CERTAINLY YOU KNOW WE COULD TRY

01:46:14.101 --> 01:46:15.235
TO PUT SOMETHING IN THE BUDGET

01:46:15.302 --> 01:46:16.436
BUT I THINK THIS IS A POLICY

01:46:16.503 --> 01:46:18.438
MATTER AS WELL WITH RESPECT TO

01:46:18.505 --> 01:46:20.774

RESOLVING THE ISSUES THERE WE

02:10:33.692 --> 02:10:34.293
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

02:10:34.359 --> 02:10:36.261
FUNDING MECHANISM IS NOT THE

02:10:36.328 --> 02:10:37.663
DEALER RECORD OF SALE -- FROM

02:10:56.281 --> 02:10:57.482
QUESTION JUST FOR CLARIFICATION

02:10:57.549 --> 02:10:59.918
SO FOR THIS PILOT PROGRAM --

02:10:59.985 --> 02:11:02.054
THIS WOULD AUGMENT OR BE IN

02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:03.956
ADDITION TO THE DOJ'S PROGRAM

02:11:04.022 --> 02:11:05.357
DOJ'S PROGRAM CRACKED AND ENDS

02:11:05.424 --> 02:11:07.292
AND NOT INSTEAD OF BUT IN

02:11:07.359 --> 02:11:09.428
ADDITION.

02:11:09.494 --> 02:11:12.731
TO A CONCLUSION.

02:11:12.798 --> 02:11:14.299
THANK YOU DID YOU.

02:11:14.366 --> 02:11:15.133
SO I HAVE A QUESTION.

02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:16.935
WHY ARE WE NOT JUST HOLDING DOJ

02:11:17.002 --> 02:11:19.037
ACCOUNTABLE FOR DOING THEIR JOB --

02:11:19.104 --> 02:11:20.606
AS OPPOSED.

02:11:20.672 --> 02:11:21.607
TO COMING UP WITH ANOTHER

02:11:21.673 --> 02:11:24.710
PROGRAM THAT IN MY MIND KIND OF

02:11:24.776 --> 02:11:27.379
IS AN END RUN AROUND -- SEARCH

02:11:27.446 --> 02:11:29.748
WARRANTS AND GIVES --

02:11:29.815 --> 02:11:31.149
DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES AN

02:11:31.216 --> 02:11:32.851
OPPORTUNITY TO CHERRY PICK HOW

02:11:32.918 --> 02:11:35.454
THEY WANTED TO END RUNS AROUND

02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:37.456
SEARCH WARRANTS.

02:11:37.522 --> 02:11:39.958
OF I THINK THERE'S BEEN THERE

02:11:40.025 --> 02:11:42.261
HAVE BEEN EFFORTS OVER THE YEAR

02:11:42.327 --> 02:11:44.463
TO HOLD -- DOJ MORE ACCOUNTABLE

02:11:44.529 --> 02:11:46.231
TO THEIR NUMBERS AND WE THINK

02:11:46.298 --> 02:11:48.267
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL JUST

02:11:48.333 --> 02:11:49.768
AUGMENT WHAT THEY'RE DOING SO

02:11:49.835 --> 02:11:50.769
THAT WE CAN REALLY START TO MAKE

02:11:50.836 --> 02:11:53.505
A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT TO ON

02:11:53.572 --> 02:11:55.974
REDUCING THE INVENTORY SO.

02:11:56.041 --> 02:11:57.809
AND AS FAR AS AND AND ROUND AND

02:11:57.876 --> 02:11:59.645
ROUND SEARCH WARRANTS I'M I'M

02:11:59.711 --> 02:12:03.181
NOT SURE -- WHAT YOU MEAN BY

02:12:03.248 --> 02:12:07.719
THAT -- WELL OKAY SO WHAT I MEAN

02:12:07.786 --> 02:12:10.322
IS -- THEY'RE SORT OF ALREADY

02:12:10.389 --> 02:12:12.224
OPPORTUNITIES. FOR THIS TO

02:12:12.291 --> 02:12:14.660
HAPPEN DOJ HAS A PROGRAM I HEAR

02:12:14.726 --> 02:12:16.428
YOUR CONCERNS AND YOUR CONCERNS

02:12:16.495 --> 02:12:17.929
ABOUT IT NOT HAPPENING FAST

02:12:17.996 --> 02:12:19.064
ENOUGH SO.

02:12:19.131 --> 02:12:20.832
RATHER THAN SORT OF CREATE

02:12:20.899 --> 02:12:22.100
SOMETHING ELSE.

02:12:22.167 --> 02:12:24.536
THAT YOU ALSO HAVE TO MONITOR --

02:12:24.603 --> 02:12:25.804
THAT ALSO COMES WITH

02:12:25.871 --> 02:12:28.173
COMPLICATIONS -- WHY NOT HOLD

02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:29.775
THE FOLKS THAT ARE ACCOUNTABLE --

02:12:29.841 --> 02:12:31.176
THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING

02:12:31.243 --> 02:12:33.078
THIS JOB -- ACCOUNTABLE HAVE

02:12:33.145 --> 02:12:34.713
THEM COME DOWN AND TALK ABOUT

02:12:34.780 --> 02:12:36.682
WHY THEY'RE NOT MOVING AS

02:12:36.748 --> 02:12:38.417
QUICKLY AS FOLKS WOULD LIKE YOU

02:12:38.483 --> 02:12:39.718
KNOW ULTIMATELY YOU ARE

02:12:39.785 --> 02:12:42.054
EMPOWERING AND FUNDING.

02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:44.323
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS AND I

02:12:44.389 --> 02:12:45.590
DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE DECIDING

02:12:45.657 --> 02:12:48.327
WHICH ONES WILL BE SELECTED BUT

02:12:48.393 --> 02:12:49.861
YOU'RE EMPOWERING THEM TO ALSO

02:12:49.928 --> 02:12:52.331
GO IN AND AND DO THIS KIND OF

02:12:52.397 --> 02:12:55.133
WORK WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING --

02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:59.938
THERE IS WHEN WE GET IT RIGHT --

02:13:00.005 --> 02:13:02.407
THAT SINCE.

02:13:02.474 --> 02:13:03.041
TWENTY SEVENTEEN YOU KNOW THERE

02:13:03.108 --> 02:13:04.443
HAS BEEN IN PLACE A PROHIBITED

02:13:04.509 --> 02:13:06.778
PERSONS FIREARMS RELINQUISHMENT

02:13:06.845 --> 02:13:09.414
FORM THAT HAS TO GET FILLED OUT

02:13:09.481 --> 02:13:11.183
AT THE END OF ANY CASE IF YOU

02:13:11.249 --> 02:13:12.718
DON'T YOU'RE IN VIOLATION AND

02:13:12.784 --> 02:13:14.386
THERE IS FOLLOW UP AND

02:13:14.453 --> 02:13:16.121
MONITORING THEY READ TAKE FIRE

02:13:16.188 --> 02:13:18.924
ARMS IMMEDIATELY -- UPON

02:13:18.990 --> 02:13:20.292
CONCLUSION OF THESE CASES SO

02:13:20.359 --> 02:13:22.227
THEN TO SAY HEY WHY DON'T WE

02:13:22.294 --> 02:13:23.962
FUND AND EMPOWER CERTAIN

02:13:24.029 --> 02:13:25.864
DEPARTMENTS WHO MAY BE OPERATING

02:13:25.931 --> 02:13:27.899
WITH INTEGRITY OR NOT TO KIND OF

02:13:27.966 --> 02:13:29.368
CHERRY PICK HOW THEY'RE GOING TO

02:13:29.434 --> 02:13:31.570
GO BACK -- YOU KNOW IN CERTAIN

02:13:31.636 --> 02:13:35.774
CASES OPEN THEM UP FOLLOW

02:13:35.841 --> 02:13:38.009
CERTAIN PEOPLE -- TOO BAD YOU

02:13:38.076 --> 02:13:39.211
KNOW DO WHATEVER THEY'RE GOING

02:13:39.277 --> 02:13:43.949
TO DO JUST KIND OF CONCERNS ME

02:13:44.015 --> 02:13:45.283
AND THE REASON WHY SHARED IS

02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:47.586
BECAUSE THERE WAS AN INSTANCE

02:13:47.652 --> 02:13:54.259
WHERE -- A GENTLE MAN -- IT WAS

02:13:54.326 --> 02:13:56.328
LISTED ON THE POLICE REPORT THAT

02:13:56.395 --> 02:13:59.264
HIS FIREARMS HAD BEEN TAKEN.

02:13:59.331 --> 02:14:00.999
PROBATION THROUGH SOME PAPERWORK

02:14:01.066 --> 02:14:02.033
ERROR.

02:14:02.100 --> 02:14:05.637
HAD IT LISTED THAT THEY WEREN'T.

02:14:05.704 --> 02:14:07.906
HIS RIGHTS ARE VIOLATED.

02:14:07.973 --> 02:14:09.841
BUSTED DOWN HIS DOOR.

02:14:09.908 --> 02:14:12.577
JACK HIM UP [inaudible]

02:14:12.644 --> 02:14:14.112
CHARGED HIM.

02:14:14.179 --> 02:14:15.981
AND ONCE ITWAS ALL REVEAL

02:14:16.047 --> 02:14:17.382
BECAUSE OF DUE PROCESS THEY

02:14:17.449 --> 02:14:19.584
REALIZE.

02:14:19.651 --> 02:14:21.653
HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY GUNS AND IN

02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:22.954
FACT THERE WAS A PAPERWORK ERROR.

02:14:23.021 --> 02:14:23.922
SO.

02:14:23.989 --> 02:14:25.590
WE'RE SORT OF EMPOWERING THE

02:14:25.657 --> 02:14:27.859
OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE KINDS OF

02:14:27.926 --> 02:14:31.229
INSTANCES TO CONTINUE TO OCCUR --

02:14:31.296 --> 02:14:32.664
WITH POPULATIONS THAT ARE

02:14:32.731 --> 02:14:35.767
ALREADY OVER POLICE DEALING WITH

02:14:35.834 --> 02:14:38.036
OVER COMPLIANCE AND AN OVER

02:14:38.103 --> 02:14:42.040
PUNISHMENT SO WHY DON'T WE JUST.

02:14:42.107 --> 02:14:43.742
HOLD THE PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE THAT

02:14:43.809 --> 02:14:45.977
WE HAVE ALREADY FUNDED TO DO THE

02:14:46.044 --> 02:14:49.581
JOB THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO

02:14:49.648 --> 02:14:49.881
[inaudible]

02:14:49.948 --> 02:14:52.150
UGH.

02:14:52.217 --> 02:14:54.252
TODAY YES THE FUNDING HAS THE

02:14:54.319 --> 02:14:55.887
EVERY YEAR THERE HAS BEEN A

02:14:55.954 --> 02:14:58.657
REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING

02:14:58.723 --> 02:14:59.257
OF THE AYE.

02:14:59.324 --> 02:15:00.459
PERHAPS SURE OF A YOU CAN

02:15:00.525 --> 02:15:02.727
COMMENT ON THIS BUT FOR US WE

02:15:02.794 --> 02:15:05.030
THINK IT CAN BE -- IT WOULD BE

02:15:05.096 --> 02:15:06.731
MORE EFFICIENT.

02:15:06.798 --> 02:15:08.200
OBVIOUSLY IF THERE'S A MISTAKE

02:15:08.266 --> 02:15:10.635
WITH THE DATABASE THAT'S A WHOLE

02:15:10.702 --> 02:15:12.537
NOTHER PROBLEM WE THINK THAT IT

02:15:12.604 --> 02:15:14.573
COULD POSSIBLY BE MORE EFFICIENT

02:15:14.639 --> 02:15:16.241
I HAVE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.

02:15:16.308 --> 02:15:17.909
WHO KNOWS THE LOCAL COMMUNITY BE

02:15:17.976 --> 02:15:19.744
ABLE TO WORK ON THE LIST OF

02:15:19.811 --> 02:15:21.279
THOSE PROHIBITED POSSESSORS AND

02:15:21.346 --> 02:15:22.614
ON THAT LIST THERE I MEAN

02:15:22.681 --> 02:15:24.749
THERE'S A THERE'S A STANDARD FOR

02:15:24.816 --> 02:15:26.718
WHO IS ON THE LIST?

02:15:26.785 --> 02:15:29.788
AND SO THIS GIVES LOCAL LAW

02:15:29.855 --> 02:15:32.891
ENFORCEMENT THE OPPORTUNITY.

02:15:32.958 --> 02:15:34.559
TO USE THE INTELLIGENCE THEY

02:15:34.626 --> 02:15:38.964
ALREADY HAVE TO WORK ON ON THE

02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:40.665
LIST IF THE LIST IS INCORRECT.

02:15:40.732 --> 02:15:41.266
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE

02:15:41.333 --> 02:15:42.267
GONNA HAVE TO KNOW TO SO THESE

02:15:42.334 --> 02:15:42.801
THE THIS WOULD BE A PILOT

02:15:42.868 --> 02:15:44.302
PROGRAMS AND THREE DIFFERENT

02:15:44.369 --> 02:15:46.171
COUNTIES -- WHERE THE SHERIFFS

02:15:46.238 --> 02:15:47.839
HAVE ALREADY AGREED AND THAT

02:15:47.906 --> 02:15:49.774
WOULD BE VERY CAREFUL DATA TAKEN

02:15:49.841 --> 02:15:51.776
SAYS TO TO SEE IF THERE IS A

02:15:51.843 --> 02:15:54.145
MODEL THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO

02:15:54.212 --> 02:15:55.747
AUGMENT WHAT THE DOJ IS DOING?

02:15:55.814 --> 02:15:56.781
AND THE IDEA THAT LOCAL LAW

02:15:56.848 --> 02:15:59.985
ENFORCEMENT HELPS THE DOJ IS NOT.

02:16:00.051 --> 02:16:02.587
UNIQUE THIS TIME THE DOJ WAS

02:16:02.654 --> 02:16:04.256
GIVEN FIVE MILLION DOLLARS.

02:16:04.322 --> 02:16:06.291
I THINK IT WAS THREE YEARS AGO --

02:16:06.358 --> 02:16:08.527
TO HAVE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:16:08.593 --> 02:16:10.295
AUGMENTS THE WORK THEY'RE DOING

02:16:10.362 --> 02:16:11.730
AND THAT MEN MONEY ENDED UP

02:16:11.796 --> 02:16:13.899
BEING ON SPENT AND CAME RIGHT

02:16:13.965 --> 02:16:15.300
BACK INTO THE GENERAL FUND SO

02:16:15.367 --> 02:16:15.867
SAID.

02:16:15.934 --> 02:16:18.036
THIS WAY WE WILL GET GOOD

02:16:18.103 --> 02:16:19.070
STATISTICS.

02:16:19.137 --> 02:16:21.373
AND WE'LL SEE HOW ACCURATE THE

02:16:21.439 --> 02:16:24.142
DATABASES THAT THE DOJ IS OF

02:16:24.209 --> 02:16:27.279
MAINTAINING.

02:16:27.345 --> 02:16:29.180
YOU KNOW.

02:16:29.247 --> 02:16:29.447
I'M SORRY.

02:16:29.514 --> 02:16:32.851
BUT THAT KILLER IN YOUR DISTRICT

02:16:32.918 --> 02:16:34.719
WHO MURDERED THOSE PEOPLE.

02:16:34.786 --> 02:16:39.090
HE WAS NOT ON THE LIST.

02:16:39.157 --> 02:16:41.059
HE HAD FAMILY MEMBERS OR FRIENDS

02:16:41.126 --> 02:16:44.396
WHO.

02:16:44.462 --> 02:16:46.331
YOU KNOW MAYBE I DON'T KNOW HAD

02:16:46.398 --> 02:16:48.400
SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT HIS MENTAL

02:16:48.466 --> 02:16:50.101
HEALTH AND HIS BEHAVIOR.

02:16:50.168 --> 02:16:52.470
BUT NOBODY WENT AND GOT AT G. B.

02:16:52.537 --> 02:16:53.872
R. O. WHICH WAS ALREADY ON THE

02:16:53.939 --> 02:16:56.274
BOOKS BECAUSE MAYBE HE DIDN'T

02:16:56.341 --> 02:16:58.476
LOOK DANGEROUS ENOUGH FOR THEY

02:16:58.543 --> 02:16:59.578
DON'T WANT US NATURE.

02:16:59.644 --> 02:17:01.479
IT CAN HAPPEN IN MY FAMILY OR HE

02:17:01.546 --> 02:17:03.114
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A DANGEROUS

02:17:03.181 --> 02:17:05.083
PERSON HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE

02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:07.752
PERSON WHO WOULD BE CAPABLE OF

02:17:07.819 --> 02:17:09.254
DOING THOSE KINDS OF THINGS.

02:17:09.321 --> 02:17:10.989
YOU KNOW THAT'S BIAS WHICH IS

02:17:11.056 --> 02:17:12.457
INHERENT IN SO MANY OF THESE

02:17:12.524 --> 02:17:13.925
CONVERSATIONS THAT WERE

02:17:13.992 --> 02:17:15.427
HAPPENING THAT WE'RE HAVING

02:17:15.493 --> 02:17:16.161
RIGHT NOW.

HE HAS -- TO ULTIMATELY A FIX

02:20:31.856 --> 02:20:33.291
AND ALSO DON'T AND THAT'S WHY

02:20:33.358 --> 02:20:34.759
THIS IS IN POLICY COMMITTEE

02:20:34.826 --> 02:20:36.060
RIGHT NOW NOT MOSTLY IN.

02:20:36.127 --> 02:20:37.662
IS WHETHER NOT WE WANT TO TAKE

02:20:37.729 --> 02:20:39.164
SOME OF THIS.

02:20:39.230 --> 02:20:41.299

ALMOST GIVE IT TO THE LOCALS.

AND SO -- THAT'S WHY COULDN'T WE

02:20:46.604 --> 02:20:48.039
WERE STILL KIND OF DEVELOPING IT.

02:20:48.106 --> 02:20:51.609
AND I KNOW YOU AND I WAS ARE WE

02:20:51.676 --> 02:20:52.310
JUST WE DISAGREE.

02:20:52.377 --> 02:20:53.978
KINDA DISAGREE BUT WE HAD TWO

02:20:54.045 --> 02:20:56.047
DIFFERENT CONCEPT OF HOW THIS

02:20:56.114 --> 02:20:59.250
SHOULD BE DONE -- IF THIS YOU

02:20:59.317 --> 02:21:01.586
FAIL I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU

02:21:01.653 --> 02:21:05.290

EVEN GIVE OUT THE GRANT.

02:21:21.072 --> 02:21:22.106
SO THAT -- WE MAKE SURE THEY GET

02:21:22.173 --> 02:21:24.409
DONE SO THE QUESTION IS THAT THE

02:21:24.475 --> 02:21:26.144
CONSUMERS WERE ASKING CAN BE

02:21:26.211 --> 02:21:28.012

NEED TO BE CONSIDERED THIS.

02:24:52.950 --> 02:24:55.119
CREATES NUMBER TEN AND I THINK

02:24:55.186 --> 02:24:56.187

HAD ALL THAT CHANGED OUT THE

02:25:18.910 --> 02:25:20.111

I I THINK THIS IS TOTALLY

02:42:33.276 --> 02:42:33.977
APPROPRIATE.

AND ADVISED PEOPLE OF THE TISSUE

02:42:54.764 --> 02:42:55.699
SAMPLE SO I THINK FROM A

02:42:55.765 --> 02:42:57.434
NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE.

02:42:57.501 --> 02:42:59.102
IT IS UNDERSTOOD.

02:42:59.169 --> 02:43:00.570
IT'S NOT CLASSIFIED AS A

02:43:00.637 --> 02:43:02.205

02:43:05.142 --> 02:43:07.177
LEGISLATURE PASSED LAWS TO DEAL

BEFORE CDC ACTUALLY RECOGNIZE IT --

02:43:12.015 --> 02:43:13.517

WHY THIS CHILD DIED.

02:43:27.230 --> 02:43:28.398

02:43:28.465 --> 02:43:33.436
TO OFFER FAMILIES A PATH. TO FOR

02:43:33.503 --> 02:43:35.805

HEALTHY AND THAT THEIR DAUGHTER

02:55:14.971 --> 02:55:16.973

THEY'RE HEALTHY FIRST.

02:55:26.148 --> 02:55:27.817
AND THE SECOND PART OF THAT EXAM

02:55:27.884 --> 02:55:30.253
IS A FORENSIC EXAM TO SEE IF

02:55:30.319 --> 02:55:31.787
THERE'S ANY FORENSIC EVIDENCE.

02:55:31.854 --> 02:55:33.723
AND SO FOR THAT PURPOSE BECAUSE

02:55:33.789 --> 02:55:35.057
THE PRIMARY EXAM.

02:55:35.124 --> 02:55:37.293

COUNSELING FOR OTHER VICTIMS OF

02:55:54.810 --> 02:55:56.412
CRIME AND THERE'S NO REASON WHY

02:55:56.479 --> 02:55:58.281
VICTIMS OF CRIME SHOULD NOT ALSO

02:55:58.347 --> 02:55:59.749

03:23:35.770 --> 03:23:37.572
IF IF IT IS TRUE THAT THIS BILL

03:23:37.638 --> 03:23:40.508
DOES PREVENT -- THE ABILITY FROM --

03:23:40.575 --> 03:23:41.943

03:23:58.926 --> 03:23:59.760
LINE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE

03:23:59.827 --> 03:24:02.296
IMPORTANT -- THAT WE VIEW THOSE

03:24:02.363 --> 03:24:04.765
POSITIVE THINGS THAT THAT

03:24:04.832 --> 03:24:05.266
PROVISIONAL OFFICER LAW

WOULD ADVOCATE THAT BE ALLOWED.

03:24:13.774 --> 03:24:15.376
TO CONTINUE SO THAT WE DON'T GET

03:24:15.443 --> 03:24:17.111
TO THAT POINT -- THAT WOULD BE A

03:24:17.178 --> 03:24:18.746
TRAGEDY IN THIS BILL IF THAT WAS

03:24:18.813 --> 03:24:19.814
A THAT.

03:24:19.880 --> 03:24:26.153
LITTLE PART WAS NOT FIXED.

03:24:26.220 --> 03:24:27.154

THAT WERE RAISED BY THE

03:24:32.560 --> 03:24:33.327
OPPOSITION BECAUSE I THINK SOME

03:24:33.394 --> 03:24:34.462
OF THEM ARE INCREDIBLY VALID AND

03:24:34.528 --> 03:24:35.997

THE BILL DOESN'T PRECLUDE ANY

03:24:48.709 --> 03:24:49.777
OTHER ACTIVITIES FOR EXAMPLE

SAID MY OFFICE AND I HAVE DONE A

03:35:13.967 --> 03:35:14.568
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESEARCH ON

03:35:14.635 --> 03:35:16.737

03:35:16.803 --> 03:35:18.005
PURPOSE OF PREVENTION WE PUBLISH

03:35:18.071 --> 03:35:19.206
REPORT.

03:35:19.273 --> 03:35:20.707
EVERY FEW YEARS THAT REALLY

03:35:20.774 --> 03:35:22.609
CHRONICLES STOLEN GUNS HOW GUNS

03:35:22.676 --> 03:35:24.278
AND UP IN THE WRONG HANDS.

03:35:24.344 --> 03:35:25.779
SO I WANT -- TO MAKE THE FIRST

03:35:25.846 --> 03:35:27.147
POINT THAT THIS IS NOT A BILL

03:35:27.214 --> 03:35:30.450
THAT WOULD TAKE FIREARMS AWAY

03:35:30.517 --> 03:35:32.185
FROM LAWFUL OWNERS [inaudible]

03:35:32.252 --> 03:35:33.453
USE ME.

03:35:33.520 --> 03:35:34.321
THIS IS REALLY A BILL TO KEEP

03:35:34.388 --> 03:35:35.889
THOSE LAWFUL GUNS IN THE RIGHT

03:35:35.956 --> 03:35:36.790
HANDS.

03:35:36.857 --> 03:35:37.891
AND WE HAVE FAR TOO MANY

03:35:37.958 --> 03:35:39.660
EXAMPLES OF GUNS BEING STOLEN

03:35:39.726 --> 03:35:41.528
OUT OF CARS AND THEN ULTIMATELY

03:35:41.595 --> 03:35:43.697
USED IN CRIMES JUST IN TWO

03:35:43.764 --> 03:35:45.165
THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN THERE ARE

03:35:45.232 --> 03:35:47.901
OVER TEN THOUSAND ALMOST ELEVEN

03:35:47.968 --> 03:35:48.402
THOUSAND GUN STOLEN IN

03:35:48.468 --> 03:35:49.102
CALIFORNIA.

03:35:49.169 --> 03:35:52.072
AND IN MY COUNTY ALONE THREE

03:35:52.139 --> 03:35:53.273
HUNDRED TWENTY SIX STOLEN GUNS A

03:35:53.340 --> 03:35:54.775
GOOD PERCENTAGE OF THAT CAME OUT

03:35:54.841 --> 03:35:57.277
OF CARS -- WE HAVE AS I SAID TOO

03:35:57.344 --> 03:35:59.313
MANY EXAMPLES OF CARS BEING

03:35:59.379 --> 03:36:01.648
BROKEN INTO AND FIREARM STOLEN

03:36:01.715 --> 03:36:03.317
THAT AREN'T LOCKED UP OR NOT

03:36:03.383 --> 03:36:05.652
SECURELY LOCKED UP -- JUST LAST

03:36:05.719 --> 03:36:06.887
WEEK IN BERKELEY WE HAD A CAR

03:36:06.953 --> 03:36:08.789
GET BROKEN INTO THE FIRE WAS IN

03:36:08.855 --> 03:36:10.157
THE CAR IT WAS STOLEN AND THIS

03:36:10.223 --> 03:36:11.391
HAPPENS.

03:36:11.458 --> 03:36:12.959
FAR TOO OFTEN.

03:36:13.026 --> 03:36:15.195
SO THIS THE OTHER POINT TO MAKE

03:36:15.262 --> 03:36:16.630
IS THAT THE WHEN THIS BILL A

03:36:16.697 --> 03:36:17.698
RICH WHEN THE LOT ORIGINALLY

03:36:17.764 --> 03:36:19.933
PASSED. TO REQUIRE FIRES BE

03:36:20.000 --> 03:36:22.502
LOCKED UP IT LEFT OUT LONG GUNS.

03:36:22.569 --> 03:36:25.472
AND IN MY COUNTY -- THAT OVER

03:36:25.539 --> 03:36:27.908
THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD OF OUR

03:36:27.974 --> 03:36:29.242
THREE THOUSAND MORE THAN THREE

03:36:29.309 --> 03:36:30.744
THOUSAND FIREARMS THAT WERE USED

03:36:30.811 --> 03:36:31.812
IN CRIMES.

03:36:31.878 --> 03:36:34.815

03:36:38.185 --> 03:36:40.020
FOURTEEN MORE ASSAULT WEAPONS

AND THOSE WERE ALL STOLEN.

03:36:41.355 --> 03:36:43.423
SO THIS BILL NOT ONLY DOES IT

03:36:43.490 --> 03:36:45.525
ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF BEING MORE

SECURELY LOCKED UP SO THAT IF

03:36:47.427 --> 03:36:48.762
SOMEONE DOES BREAK INTO A CAR.

03:36:48.829 --> 03:36:51.131
IT'S NOT EASY TO GET A GUN OUT

03:36:51.198 --> 03:36:53.166
OR FIRE ABOUT BUT SECONDLY IT

03:36:53.233 --> 03:36:56.303
JUST EXT EXTENDS THE THE CURRENT

03:36:56.370 --> 03:36:58.338

03:36:58.405 --> 03:36:59.206

OFTEN TIMES USING CRIMES

03:37:01.475 --> 03:37:03.710

03:37:36.610 --> 03:37:37.577
WE HAVE TWO MAIN POINTS WE

03:37:37.644 --> 03:37:38.879
WANTED TO KNOW TODAY AND WE HAVE

03:37:38.945 --> 03:37:41.314
TALKED WITH THE AUTHOR WITH THE

WILL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT IT

03:37:45.252 --> 03:37:46.753
BUT THE THE TWO ISSUES WE WANTED

03:37:46.820 --> 03:37:49.256
TO RACE TODAY -- ONE THE THE

03:37:49.322 --> 03:37:51.725
ADDITIONAL LOCKING REQUIREMENTS --

03:37:51.792 --> 03:37:54.728
AS IT RELATES TO LONG GUNS COULD

03:37:54.795 --> 03:37:57.197
IMPACT THE TIME IT TAKES TO

03:37:57.264 --> 03:37:58.265
ACCESS THE WEAPON IN AN

03:37:58.331 --> 03:38:00.033
EMERGENCY SITUATION SO.

03:38:00.100 --> 03:38:00.967
IF IT'S A SITUATION WHERE YOU

SOME FUNCTION IT'S SOMETHING

03:38:05.639 --> 03:38:06.740
THAT TAKES A SECOND OR TWO COULD

03:38:06.807 --> 03:38:09.009
MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE

03:38:09.075 --> 03:38:09.543
AND DEATH IN AN EMERGENCY

03:38:09.609 --> 03:38:10.544

WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS TO

03:38:16.216 --> 03:38:18.819

A COUPLE OF THINGS NUMBER ONE WE

03:39:43.770 --> 03:39:44.938
SEE IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY GOING

03:39:45.005 --> 03:39:47.073
AWAY FROM USING FRAMES AND

03:39:47.140 --> 03:39:48.174

BECAUSE OF HOW THE BATTERY SETS.

03:39:55.148 --> 03:39:57.484
AND SO -- COMPLIANCE WITH THIS

03:39:57.551 --> 03:40:01.688
WOULD BE VERY COSTLY -- AND

03:40:01.755 --> 03:40:03.356
COULD BE INCREDIBLY PROBLEMATIC --

03:40:03.423 --> 03:40:04.324

DISTRIBUTORS TO THE DEALERS IN

03:40:41.728 --> 03:40:42.596

THIS LAW DOES NOT EXAM PEACE

03:41:30.677 --> 03:41:32.746
OFFICERS RIGHT.

03:41:44.257 --> 03:41:46.359
MOTIVE DIFFICULT TO PERFORM

03:41:46.426 --> 03:41:49.896
THEIR JOB IS REALLY TO MAKE SURE

03:41:49.963 --> 03:41:53.566
THAT -- WE DON'T.

03:41:53.633 --> 03:41:55.201
EASILY AT THE LEVEL THAT THOSE

GUNS GET ANNA AND UP IN THE

03:41:56.736 --> 03:41:58.071
WRONG HANDS.

03:41:58.138 --> 03:42:00.507

THIS ISSUE AND HOW DOES THIS

03:42:11.718 --> 03:42:18.625
ENCOURAGE SOMEONE TO REPORT THAT

03:42:18.692 --> 03:42:20.427
THEIR GUN HAS BEEN STOLEN?

03:42:20.493 --> 03:42:21.561
BECAUSE IF IF A GUN IS STOLEN

03:42:21.628 --> 03:42:23.430
AND THEY REPORTED THEN YOU KNOW.

03:42:23.496 --> 03:42:24.798
THERE IT'S PUNISHABLE AS A CRIME

03:42:24.864 --> 03:42:25.398
THEY'RE FINE BUT SO HOW DOES

03:42:25.465 --> 03:42:27.267

04:01:20.365 --> 04:01:24.903
WE TRIED EVERYTHING -- WE TRIED

04:01:24.970 --> 04:01:25.571
TO DO IS STATEWIDE SYSTEM -- BUT

04:01:25.637 --> 04:01:26.238
WE HAD DIFFERENT COUNTIES HAVING

04:01:26.305 --> 04:01:27.306
DIFFERENT FORMS IN DIFFERENT

04:01:27.372 --> 04:01:29.474
PROCESSES WE HAD PEOPLE GOING TO

04:01:29.541 --> 04:01:30.409
ONE COUNTY THINKING THAT THEY

04:01:30.475 --> 04:01:31.643
CLEARED ALL THEIR CONVICTIONS

04:01:31.710 --> 04:01:33.412
GOING TO GET JOBS AND STILL

04:01:33.478 --> 04:01:34.680
GETTING DENIED BECAUSE THEY

04:01:34.746 --> 04:01:35.647
DIDN'T REALIZE THEY HAD A

04:01:35.714 --> 04:01:37.115
CONVICTION IN ANOTHER COUNTY.

04:01:37.182 --> 04:01:38.717
WE TRY TO WORK WITH THE J. TO

04:01:38.784 --> 04:01:40.018
GET STATEWIDE RAPSHEETS SO THAT

04:01:40.085 --> 04:01:41.753
WE CAN REALLY GET IN A CLEAR ALL

04:01:41.820 --> 04:01:43.555
OF THE RECORDS ON A PERSON'S --

04:01:43.622 --> 04:01:45.457
RAP SHEET AND THAT PRESENTED ITS

04:01:45.524 --> 04:01:46.592
OWN BERRIER SINCE GETTING THE

04:01:46.658 --> 04:01:48.060
RAP SHEET ITSELF COSTS SIXTY

04:01:48.126 --> 04:01:49.461
DOLLARS SO THEN WE WHEN WE TRY

04:01:49.528 --> 04:01:50.829
TO DO RAP SHEET EVENTS AND

04:01:50.896 --> 04:01:52.130
CLINICS AND WE DID.

04:01:52.197 --> 04:01:53.432
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND

04:01:53.498 --> 04:01:54.666
THOUSANDS OF INTERVIEWS AND

04:01:54.733 --> 04:01:56.435
DISCUSSIONS WITH PEOPLE THAT HAD

04:01:56.501 --> 04:01:57.502
CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS ON THEIR

04:01:57.569 --> 04:01:58.837
RECORD WE BUILT CAPACITY

04:01:58.904 --> 04:02:00.439
THROUGHOUT THE STATE WITH

04:02:00.505 --> 04:02:01.640

04:02:01.707 --> 04:02:03.575

04:02:06.712 --> 04:02:07.412
THREE YEARS.

04:02:07.479 --> 04:02:09.014

04:02:09.081 --> 04:02:10.249
STILL.

04:02:10.315 --> 04:02:11.783
I THINK THE NUMBERS A MILLION

04:02:11.850 --> 04:02:12.351
PEOPLE THAT STILL STAND TO

04:02:12.417 --> 04:02:13.285
BENEFIT.

04:02:13.352 --> 04:02:15.220
SO THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN

04:02:15.287 --> 04:02:16.989
REALLY MAKE THE PROMISE OF PROP

04:02:17.055 --> 04:02:18.323

TARGET THE PEOPLE THAT.

04:02:21.827 --> 04:02:23.762
ARE ELIGIBLE AND THEN WE CAN GO

04:02:23.829 --> 04:02:25.397
OUT IT FROM THAT DIRECTION I

04:02:25.464 --> 04:02:26.632

ARE SEVERAL NON CITIZENS THAT

04:02:30.936 --> 04:02:33.338
ALSO STAND TO BENEFIT FROM PROP.

04:02:33.405 --> 04:02:33.939

GEORGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC

04:08:36.635 --> 04:08:38.236
DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION WE'RE

04:08:38.303 --> 04:08:40.939
STILL IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL.

04:08:41.006 --> 04:08:42.874
AND BASICALLY WE DON'T THINK IT

04:08:42.941 --> 04:08:44.276
MAKES SENSE.

04:08:44.342 --> 04:08:47.279
TO FINE PROSTITUTES TO FUND

04:08:47.345 --> 04:08:49.681
SERVICES FOR PROSTITUTES AND

04:08:49.748 --> 04:08:52.183
THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES -- IN

04:08:52.250 --> 04:08:53.885
THE MUNICIPAL COURT WHAT USED TO

04:08:53.952 --> 04:08:55.420
BE CALMING TO SUPPORT NOW

04:08:55.487 --> 04:08:58.123
SUPERIOR COURT -- IN OAKLAND WE

04:08:58.189 --> 04:09:01.192
DO NOT SEE ROGER CRAFT WE DO NOT

04:09:01.259 --> 04:09:04.462
SEE HI PRESS PRICE CALL GIRLS.

04:09:04.529 --> 04:09:07.332
WE SEE STREET PROSTITUTES.

04:09:07.399 --> 04:09:09.567
AND THOSE FOR THE MOST PART

04:09:09.634 --> 04:09:11.069
WOMEN SOME MEN.

04:09:11.136 --> 04:09:15.206
ARE LUCKY TO MAKE A HUNDRED TO

04:09:15.273 --> 04:09:16.041
TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY.

04:09:16.107 --> 04:09:19.778
AND YES SERVICES ARE NEEDED --

04:09:19.844 --> 04:09:21.846
FOR PROSTITUTES BUT BASICALLY

04:09:21.913 --> 04:09:23.581
THIS BILL.

04:09:23.648 --> 04:09:26.084
BECAUSE FINDS UNFORTUNATELY JUST

04:09:26.151 --> 04:09:28.553
BECOME ROUTINE THEY GET STAMPED

04:09:28.620 --> 04:09:30.322
INTO THE PROCESS AND FEES AND

04:09:30.388 --> 04:09:32.390
ASSESSMENTS GET SENT ON TOP OF

04:09:32.457 --> 04:09:35.493
THEM SO NOW THE MINIMUM FINE.

04:09:35.560 --> 04:09:37.362
IS FOR MISDEMEANORS A HUNDRED

04:09:37.429 --> 04:09:39.397
AND FIFTY DOLLARS PLUS FEES AND

04:09:39.464 --> 04:09:42.200
ASSESSMENTS BRINGS IT TO OVER

04:09:42.267 --> 04:09:43.401
TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS.

04:09:43.468 --> 04:09:46.438
IF THIS BILL IS ENACTED THE

04:09:46.504 --> 04:09:48.406
MAXIMUM FEES GOING TO BE TWO

04:09:48.473 --> 04:09:49.341
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

04:09:49.407 --> 04:09:51.576
AND AS IT SAYS IN THE ANALYSIS

04:09:51.643 --> 04:09:53.912
WITH THE FINES AND FEES IT COULD

04:09:53.978 --> 04:09:57.215
WELL TOP EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS --

04:09:57.282 --> 04:09:59.451
I DON'T THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE

04:09:59.517 --> 04:10:01.286
IN OAKLAND ARE GONNA BE FACED

04:10:01.353 --> 04:10:02.787
WITH AN EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLAR

04:10:02.854 --> 04:10:04.823
FEE BUT I THINK THAT IT WILL

04:10:04.889 --> 04:10:07.559
BECOME ROUTINE TO SLAP ANOTHER

04:10:07.625 --> 04:10:09.260
TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS ON THE TWO

04:10:09.327 --> 04:10:10.995
HUNDRED EXISTING FEE.

04:10:11.062 --> 04:10:13.565
AND THAT THAT WILL MAKE IT A

04:10:13.631 --> 04:10:17.335
CHOICE FOR MY CLIENTS -- TO

04:10:17.402 --> 04:10:19.471
EITHER PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE OR
