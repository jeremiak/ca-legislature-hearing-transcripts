THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON EDUCATION FINANCE. PLEASE TAKE THE ROLE. MCCARTY. HERE CHAVEZ HERE. MURATSUCHI. VOEPEL YOU. CORMAN'S ESTABLISHED. OKAY. GREAT SAID TODAY WE HAVE THE HEARING. FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE MULTIPLE YOU SEE BUDGET ISSUES. I DISCUSS THE FIRST WE'LL GET AN UPDATE ON THE FIVE ACTION ITEMS THAT YOU SEE WAS ASKED TO COMPLETE AS PART OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AGREEMENT. LATER THE STATE AUDIT AND WE WILL GET UPDATES. ON THAT AND SEE HOW DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FEELS ABOUT FREEING UP THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. BY MAY THE FIRST PURSUANT TO THAT ARRANGEMENT. IT WILL THEN HERE. FROM THE PERMANENT FINANCE AND THE UC ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL AS WELL AS THE YOU SEE. REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING PURSUANT TO THE REGION. BUDGET ACTION ABOUT LATER WILL DISCUSS THE OF PROP FIFTY SIX ISSUE. AND. MET MEDICAL FUNDING. AND THEN WE'LL TALK ABOUT OFFICE THE PRESIDENT IN THE UC PATH ISSUES. AND THAT OVERALL OF COURSE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE. THE THE MARQUIS I RESEARCH UNIVERSITY IN CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. AND TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE A THRIVING UNIVERSITY BUT ALSO EXPAND ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIANS AND THAT'S. ONE ISSUE THAT'S GOING TO BE GOING THROUGH ALL THESE AGENDA ITEMS AS HOW THIS CAN RELATE TO US CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE. ACCESS FOR FUTURE CALIFORNIANS TO ATTEND EITHER YOU SEE SO WITH THAT LET'S GET GOING AT ISSUE NUMBER ONE YEAH BERMAN A FINANCE. GOOD MORNING JAX WELL DEPARTMENT FINANCE OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUDGET ACT HELD FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM UC'S APPROPRIATION TO BE RELEASED. WHEN THE UC COMBAT MET FIVE EXPECTATIONS THESE EXPECTATIONS WERE THAT THE UC WOULD ONE. COMPLETE DOT THREE ACTIVITY BASED COSTING PILOTS TO ACHIEVE A TRANSFER. ENROLLMENT RATIO OF ONE TRANSFER STUDENT FOR EVERY TWO NEW. ENTRANT FRESHMEN STUDENTS. THREE THAT THEY WOULD IMPLEMENT THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR THAT THEY WOULD ADOPT A POLICY ENDING SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT PAYMENTS TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT NEW SENIOR MANAGEMENT REPLACED. AND FIVE THAT THEY WOULD RELEASE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE UNIVERSITY'S FINANCES. I THE UC HAS UNTIL MAY FIRST TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO PROVIDE THE DIRECTOR FRANCIS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE THAT IS MADE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO MEET HIS EXPECTATIONS. AYE AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ASSUMES THE RELEASE OF THE FIFTY MILLION AND CURRENT. AND IN OUR CONVERSATION WITH YOU SEE IS ON GOING ON THIS MATTER FIGURE. THANK YOU LA UP DECENT CONCENTRA SILLY รณ I THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP IF I FIRST WALK THROUGH ON SOME OF THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING SOME OF THE CONDITIONS THAT. ARE IN THE SUIT ISSUE. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE OF YOUR AGENDA IT ACTUALLY LISTS EACH OF THE FIVE CONDITIONS. AND THERE'S UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THESE CONDITIONS THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE WILL ULTIMATELY MAKE. THE FINAL DETERMINATION WHETHER OR NOT YOU SEE HAS MADE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO MEET EACH CONDITION. THAT SAID THEY'RE THEY'RE DUSTING TO BE. SOME ISSUES WHERE IT APPEARS THAT YOU SEE HAS. AND MADE AN EFFORT TO MEET THOSE CONDITIONS IF YOU LOOK ON PAGE FIVE AYE YOU SEE HAS INDICATED. ON THAT FIRST ISSUE FOR ACTIVITY BASED COSTING THAT. THEY'VE LONG ASSERTED THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO MEET THAT CONDITION THAT THEY WERE IN THE PROCESS OF FINALIZING THE REPORT ON THAT. AND THEY'VE ALSO THE REGIONS RECENTLY ADOPTED A POLICY REGARDING. SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT PAYMENTS. AND IN A DECEMBER REPORT YOU SEE DID DEVELOP A LIST OF SYSTEM WIDE INITIATIVES SO DOES DO THAT THERE'D THERE'D IT APPEARS THAT YOU SEE HAS. AT LEAST MADE AN EFFORT TO MEET THOSE ARE MADE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO MEET THOSE. REQUIREMENTS IT'LL ULTIMATELY BE UP TO THE DIRECTOR TO MAKE THAT DECISION. OF THE IF THE TERRITORY THINK THERE'S THE MOST UNCERTAINTY IS INVOLVED THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND OF THE TRANSFER ISSUES WE WANTED TO TOUCH ON EACH OF THOSE VERY QUICKLY. REGARDING THE AUDITOR RECOMMENDATIONS RETURN TO THE FOLLOWING PAGE ON YOUR AGENDA THE PAGE FOR. I'M YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE EVERY SINGLE RECOMMENDATION THAT THE AUDITOR MADE THAT WAS DUE IN APRIL TWENTY EIGHTEEN. IN A JANUARY UPDATE TO THE LED TO THE STATE REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS THE AUDITOR NOTED THAT YOU SEE HAD FULLY IMPLEMENTED ONE OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED ANOTHER THAT LEFT MOST OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS LEFT TO BE OF IMPLEMENTED. A LOT HAS CHANGED SINCE JANUARY SO YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK YOU SEE ABOUT HOW IT FEELS. AND IT HAS MET THESE REPAIR RECOMMENDATIONS BUT THE AUDITOR DID NOTE. ON SOME CONCERNS THAT IT IT HAD SEEN SOME SIGNALS FROM THE UNIVERSITY INDICATING THE UNIVERSITY MIGHT NOT MAKE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO IT IMPLEMENT SOME OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. SO FOR THAT REASON WE DO THINK THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY HERE REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT. THE AUDITOR AND ULTIMATELY THE DIRECTOR WILL DETERMINE WHETHER YOU SEE HAS A MANY GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO MEET THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. ON THE TRANSFER ISSUE. WHAT WE THINK IT'S A BASED ON DATA THAT WE'VE SEEN FROM YOU SEE IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT TO THE CAMPUSES RIVERSIDE AND SANTA CRUZ WILL NOT HIT THEIR TWO ONE TRANSFER FRESHMEN TO TRANSFER RATIO? I BECAUSE OF THAT IT THE ADMINISTRATION WILL. HAVE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU SEE MADE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO. ACHIEVE THAT RACIAL RATHER THAT WHETHER IT ACTUALLY WILL ACHIEVE THAT RATIO. ANDIN DETERMINING THAT DETERMINING THAT IT APPEARS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WILL MAKE THIS. WHAT ASSESSMENT BASED ON? AND AMMO YOU THAT YOU SEE RECENTLY OUR. AGREED TO WITH OF THE COMMUTER COLLEGE CANCERS OFFICE REGARDING TRANSFER REFORM. JUST A SOME BACKGROUND THE STATE HAS LONG TRIED TO SIMPLIFY THE TRANSFER PROCESS FOR STUDENTS ON HISTORICALLY STUDENTS HAVE FACED DIFFERENT TRANSFER REQUIREMENTS DEPENDING ON WHICH CAMPUS THEY WANTED TO TRANSFER TO. SO IF THEY WANTED TO TRANSFER TO A UC CAMPUS OR YOU CSU CAMPUS OR EVEN WITHIN THE SYSTEM EACH CAMPUS OF HAD ITS OWN TRANSFER REQUIREMENTS. AND THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR STUDENTS TO SORT OF PLAN WHICH COURSES THEY WANTED TO TAKE. ON AN EFFORT TO REFORM THAT THE STATE'S. REFORM THE TRANSFER PROCESS BETWEEN CSU IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES BY ESTABLISHING SOMETHING KNOWN AS ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER. WITH THAT DEGREE DOES IS IT ALLOWS STUDENTS TO. COMPLETE AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE WITHIN SIXTY UNITS AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ANY GUARANTEES THAT THAT'S IN WILL BE ADMITTED SOMEWHERE AT THE CSU SYSTEM. AND BE ABLE TO COMPLETE OF A PROGRAM AT CSU WITH AN ADDITIONAL SIXTY UNITS SUCH THAT THE STUDENT HAS A PATHWAY TO COMPLETE SOME OF FOUR YEAR DEGREE WITHIN FOUR YEARS OF FULL TIME STUDY. OTHER SECONDARY BENEFIT STUDENTS ALSO COMPLETE AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE IS PART OF THAT PROCESS. YOU SEE HAS HAD ITS OWN TRANSFER PATHWAYS ON THERE THAT THAT HAVE SOME CROSS OVER TO AND THAT CSU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE. ASSOCIATE REFER TRANSFERRED BUT THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES. ON IT THEY JUST THESE PATHWAYS GENERALLY REQUIRE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT COURSES IN A NUMBER OF CASES OFTEN MORE. MAJOR PREPARE TO RECORD SAYS THEY DON'T GUARANTEE A STUDENT CAN COMPLETE WITH A HUNDRED TWENTY UNITS THEY DON'T GUARANTEE A STUDENT CAN GRADUATE I I CAN. IS ADMITTED TO THE SYSTEM. AND THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST TRANSFER PATHWAYS ARE NOT ASSOCIATE DEGREES. I'M WHAT THE SUMMER YOU DOES BETWEEN YOU SEE AND AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS YOU SEE IS COMMITTING TO. CHANGE ONE OF THESE WHICH IS TO GUARANTEE STUDENTS ADMISSION TO THE UC SYSTEM IF IF THEY I'M. A COMPLETE ONE OF THE UC I TRANSFER PATHWAYS. IT ALSO LISTS OTHER THINGS YOU YOU SEE MIGHT EXPLORE IN THE FUTURE AT ONE OF THOSE OPTIONS FOR EXAMPLE IS THAT YOU SEE IS CONSIDERING CREEK THAT. WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO CREATE A SEPARATE AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER THAT'S SPECIFIC TO YOU SEE. AS YOU THINKING ABOUT THE SORT OF A DECISIONS REGARDING TRANCE REFORM WE WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT WAYS TO SIMPLIFY THE TRANSFER PROCESS. I'M FOR STUDENTS WHETHER OR NOT THEY GO TO SEE US YOU WERE YOU SEE. ONE OF THE POSSIBILITIES THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM SOME OF THESE POLICY CHANGES THAT YOU SEE IS CONSIDERING IS THAT IT COULD JUST ADD A LITTLE MORE COMPLEXITY. THAT'S BECAUSE STUDENTS WILL FACE BOTH AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER OF FOR CSU OR THEY COULD TAKE ONE FOR YOU SEE BUT THEY STILL FACE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH SYSTEM SO IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE TRYING TO PLAN AND. THINK ABOUT GOING INTO ONE IS SORT OF ON. I THINK ABOUT GOING TO A YOU YOU SEE CAMPUS BUT THAT HAVE SORT OF A BACK UP CSU CAMPUS THAT MIGHT BE LESS SELECTIVE THAT THEY STILL FACED IF THEY MIGHT STILL FACE DIFFERENT OF COURSE REQUIREMENTS SO. THAT THAT COULD ADD TO SOME OF THE COMPLEXITY THEIR. SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME THINGS TO THINK ABOUT IS YOUR REVIEWING. F YOU THINK YOU. THANK YOU. YOU THINK. SAY EVER TANNING FOR UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU SO MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. UP AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE STATED. OF WE WERE PROVIDED WITH FIVE CRITERIA WITHIN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET THAT WE HAD TO MEET IN ORDER TO. OUGHT RECEIVE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS CURRENTLY WITH HELD. AREN'T THOSE ARE LISTED ON PAGE TWO OF THE SLIDE HAND OUT THAT ARE PROVIDED TO YOU. OF AMNESTY LA ARTICULATED. TWO OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE AT. UP R. IT HAVE NOT YET BEEN FOUND TO BE FULLY COMPLETED BY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL BE FOUND. A TO BE ADEQUATELY COMPLETED OF ON SLIGHT THREE I DISCUSSED THE TRANSFER RATIO. FOR OUR CAMPUSES. AND SO FIVE OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE AT THIS POINT FULLY ATTAINED A TWO TO ONE. UP FRESHMAN TRANSFER RATIO. SENATE CREWS AND RIVERSIDE CAMPUSES REMAIN ABOVE THE RATIO. HOWEVER THEY BOTH CREATED BOTH CAMPUSES CREDIT PLANS FOR HOW THEY WILL INCREASE THEIR TRANSFER STUDENTS AND ATTAINED A TWO TO ONE RATIO. FOLLOWING THESE PLANS. RIVERSIDE CAMPUS WAS ABLE TO. INCREASE ITS APPLICATIONS FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS BY NINETEEN PERCENT. THIS LAST FALL SO GREAT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE ON THAT FRONT AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL. IN. WITHIN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. ATTAIN A TWO TO ONE RATIO ON THESE CAMPUSES. IN ADDITION TO WORKING TOWARDS. A TWO TO ONE RATIO ON THE RIVERSIDE AND. US SANTA CRUZ CAMPUSES. OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REQUESTED AN ADDITIONAL CRITERIA OF THEM. OF MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE UC AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. UP AS DAILY NEWS STATED TO INCREASE THESE TRANSFER PATHWAYS. FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO THE UC I WANTED TO DISCUSS THIS A LITTLE BIT. WITH FEW THIS AMMO YOU WERE SIGNED ABOUT ONE WEEK AGO. ON SLIDE FOR. I HAVE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ADMISSIONS POLICY. AT THE UNIVERSITY ORNATUS THE ACADEMIC SENATE THAT DETERMINES THE ADMISSIONS CRITERIA FOR OUR STUDENTS ARE ACADEMIC SENATE HAS BEEN VERY FOCUSED ON OUR STUDENTS BEING READY FOR UNIVERSITY LEVEL WORK. AND BEING READY FOR THE MAJOR INTO WHICH THEY ARE ADMITTED. THE CSU ASSOCIATE DEGREE OF TRANSFERS MORE FOCUSED ON. GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS AND NOT ON THE MAJOR INTO THE WHICH THE STUDENT. IS REQUESTING ADMISSION. CURRENTLY WE HAVE SIX UC CAMPUSES. BUT HOW OF UP. MACHINE GUARANTEE. FOR SPECIFIC MAJORS TO USE. AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN PLACE SINCE THE NINETEEN NINETIES AND CURRENTLY ABOUT ONE THIRD OF OUR TRANSFER STUDENTS ENTERED THE UC SYSTEM THROUGH THESE TAG AGREEMENTS. IN ADDITION SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN WE PUT IN PLACE TWENTY ONE TRANSFER PATHWAYS. WHICH APPLIED TO ANY YOU SEE FOR SPECIFIC MAJOR. THE STUDENT CAN TAKE A SET OF COURSES AND IS READY TO COMPLETE THEIR MAJOR WORK WITHIN THAT MAJOR AND CAN APPLY TO ANY YOU SEE HAVING COMPLETED THAT SET OF COURSES. PRESIDENT PAUL TANA'S NOW CONVENE THE TRANSFER TASK FORCE. WHICH IS EXAMINING ADDITIONAL WAYS TO. MAKE THE TRANSFERS EASIER. FOR STUDENTS AND PROVIDE. A CLEAR PATH. FOR THOSE WHO MAY NOT HAVE HAD IT PREVIOUSLY. OUR ACADEMIC SENATE IS NOW WORKING ON AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE OF SCIENCE WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT WOULD GUARANTEE ADMISSION FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHEN PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY. WHO HAVE A QUALIFYING GPA? AND THEY WOULD BE READY FOR THOSE MAJORS. THEN SO WE BELIEVE THAT ON THE TO THE ONE WHERE MAKING EXCELLENT PROGRESS AND THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IS VERY LIKELY TO FIND US. IN COMPLIANCE IN FACT. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DIRECTOR REGARDING OUR CAMPUS PLANS WROTE TO. OUR PROVOST AT THE EFFORTS DESCRIBED IN THOSE PLANS APPEARED TO BE A REASONABLE STEPS TOWARD ACHIEVING TO EXPECT THAT RATIO. SO WE'RE MAKING VERY GOOD PROGRESS. THEN. THE NEXT LARGE ITEM THAT WE HAVE TO CLEAR THE NEXT BIG HURDLE IS DE AUDIT RESPONSE. THE AUDITOR REQUESTED TEN ACTIONS. OF WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE AUDIT RELEASED SO APRIL TWENTY FIFTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO IT'S JUST. UP A WEEK AWAY WE HAVE TO COMPLETE TEN TASKS AND THOSE AREN'T SLIDES FIVE AND SIX. BUT THE PACKET THAT I PROVIDED TO THE FIRST SLIDE. SHOWS THOSE ACTIONS THAT ARE AT THIS POINT COOLEY. COMPLETE. WE. SOME OF THESE HAVE A STE PHASE ONE AND PHASE TWO PHASE ONE BEING IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN OF FACE TO BEING IN. TWENTY NINETEEN. SO SOME HAVE BEEN VOTED ON BY THE REGION'S AND SOME THE REGIONS HAVE HEARD AN ITEM WHERE THE. INITIAL RESEARCH HAS BEEN PRESENTED. BUT. WE ARE NOW WE HAVE. THERE'S BEEN A WORKING GROUP. THAT HAS LOOKED AT THE. COMPARABLE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR PAY DATA. AND. UC OP HAS PERFORMED EXTENSIVE INDEPTH ANALYSIS OF INTERNAL EXTERNAL DATA TO DETERMINE HOW BEST TO INCORPORATE STATE POSITIONS IN THE UNIVERSITY SALARY SETTINGS METHODOLOGY. AND THE REGION'S WERE PRESENTED WITH THOSE FINDINGS IN MARCH. THEN. DO YOU. REGION'S HAVE ALSO. SO THE BALLOT EVALUATION IDENTIFICATION OF NEEDED CHANGES TO EMPLOYEE BENEFIT POLICIES. TO INSURE THAT WE HAVE SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE. CHANGES WERE MADE THE POLICIES FOR CAR ALLOWANCES MEAL LIMITS HOTEL RATES REALLOCATION ALLOWANCES. MOVING REIMBURSEMENT AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS AND THE REGION'S FORMALLY ADOPTED A POLICY AROUND THOSE RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS AT THEIR MARCH MEETING. AND SO FORTH THESE CRITERIA WE HAVE COMPLETED WE HAVE HAD OF WORK. WORKING INTERNAL WORKING GROUPS THAT HAVE LOOKED AT THESE. AREAS AND HAVE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WORKING EXTREMELY HARD TO COMPLETE. A COMPLETE SHE'S CRITERIA. AND FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN INTERNALLY. AND PRESENTED TO THE REGION'S. FOR UPDATES FOR THOSE THAT. ARE DO LATER AND FOR THOSE THAT THE REGENTS. HAVE OUR POT NEW POLICIES THE REGIONS HAVE ACTUALLY VOTED THEM. INTO PLACE. IN THEIR. DURING THE CURRENT YEAR. AND I THINK ALL'S DOT THERE AND PAUSED BURNING QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. ON THIS ISSUE. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MR MEDINA. TO YOU SEE IF YOU COULD. SHARE WITH US. THE OBSTACLES THAT. YOU. THAT UC RIVERSIDE AND YOU SEE SANTA CRUZ FACED. AND TRYING TO MEET THE. TWO TO ONE RATIO ON TRANSCRIPT BICU WHERE OF WHAT OP SCHOOLS WERE IN THEIR WAY. FOR SEMI WAS DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO REACH. THAT RACIAL YES THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SIR OF FOR UC SANTA CRUZ ONE OF THE LARGEST DIFFICULTIES WITH THE LACK OF STUDENT HOUSING AND. DE AGREEMENT WITH THE TOWN OF SANTA CRUZ AT THE CAMPUS WOULD LIMIT GROWTH THIS MEANS THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO CHANGE THE BALANCE OF THE EXISTING ENROLLMENT. ON THE CAMPUS FOOT PICS LIKE THE LONGER. TO CHANGE THAT AND ALSO. SANTA CRUZ HAD A LACK OF QUALIFYING APPLICATIONS. FROM BOB TRANSFER STUDENTS NEARBY THEY HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVE TO. SEND. RECRUITMENT US STAFF TO NEARBY COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND EVEN FURTHER OUT. TO CAREER FAIRS AND. TO THE TO THE. COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES TO LET STUDENTS KNOW ABOUT BY UNIVERSITIES UPS UC SANTA CRUZ. AND ALSO THE FINANCIAL AID AVAILABLE. SO THE STUDENTS FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE APPLYING. A RIVERSIDE HAD A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FRESHMAN APPLICANTS. THE TRADITIONALLY A AND. I THINK THE RATIO IS SOMETHING LIKE. THREE THREE FRESHMEN ENTRANCE TO. A A TRANSFER STUDENT AND THAT CAMPUS ALSO WAS NOT VIEWED BY TRANSFER STUDENTS AS A. VIABLE OPTION. SO BY SENDING THEIR ADVISORS OUT THERE COMMUTE COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND TALKING TO STUDENTS ABOUT. DE OPTION IF YOU SEE A LOT OF THE STUDENTS VIEWED YOU SEE AS TOO EXPENSIVE AND DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE A VERY. GENEROUS FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM WHERE FIFTY SIX PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS DO NOT. END UP HAVING TO PAY TUITION BUT HAVE THAT TUITION FULLY COVERED BY GRANTS AND INSTITUTIONAL AID. AND ONE STOP WORD BEGAN TO GET OUT RIVERSIDE WAS ABLE TO INCREASE THEIR TRANSFER APPLICATION RATES BY NINETEEN PERCENT. THANK YOU I I I KNEW THAT THEY HAD FACED A VERY. VARIOUS DIFFERENT OBSTACLES SO THANK YOU. JEFF JARVIS. WE'RE. TALKING ABOUT IT. NOW. YOU TALK FOR DIVIDE UP FROM THE ACTIVITY BASED COSTING THAT YOU CONDUCTED. SO THANK YOU SIR I ACTIVITY BASED COSTING REPORT. I HOPE YOU'LL HAVE WITHIN A WEEK VEGAS IT'S DONE WEARS A BLUE WAITING FOR FINAL SENATORS BY THIS FRIDAY. OF THE CAMPUSES THAT PARTICIPATED WERE UC RIVERSIDE COLLEGE OF HUMANITIES ARTS AND SOCIAL SCIENCES UC DAVIS DEPARTMENT CHEMISTRY MECHANICAL ENGINEERING AND PSYCHOLOGY. AND UC MERCED INTERIORS OF CHEMISTRY COMPUTER SCIENCE AND PSYCHOLOGY. AND. OUR LARGER. DATA SYSTEMS ON THE CAMPUSES HALF TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER OR. THE. ANALYSIS SIMPLY ISN'T. NOT RELIABLE THAT THERE WAS A MASSIVE HURDLE RIVERSIDE WAS AN OBVIOUS CHOICE BOARD THIS BECAUSE THEY HAD. IN PLACE A NEW ACCOUNTING SYSTEM THAT CONNECTED THEIR. FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING WITH THEIR CLASSROOM DATA. AND. STUDENT SUCCESS RATES DATA PALM AND THEY WERE ABLE TO DO ANALYSIS MORE BROADLY. BUT WHAT WE ALSO FOUND WAS THAT THE ANALYSIS TENDED TO BE VERY SILO THAT IT WAS NOT. COMPARATIVO FROM ONE UC TO ANOTHER AND EVEN FROM ONE COLLEGE TO ANOTHER ON CAMPUS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO MAKE THOSE COMPARISONS. BECAUSE NOT ALL OF THE. THE ACTIVITY BASED COSTING TRIES TO CAPTURE. A VERY DETAILED PRODUCTION COST FOR. POSSIBLY A NEW STUDENT. A UNIT OF EDUCATION RATHER THAN THE WAY WE CURRENTLY DO IT IS LOOKING AT LARGER SCALE MARGINAL COST ACROSS. THE ENTIRE SYSTEM OF A NEW STUDENT. SO IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN DETAILED LEVEL. DATA TO ACTUALLY DO THAT ANALYSIS. A LOT OF THE MANAGERS COMPLAIN THAT THE. ACTIVITY BASED COSTING PROVIDED THEM WITH COST DATA BUT NOT WITH QUALITY DATA. SO THAT THERE WAS NO WAY TO TELL WHICH COURSE WAS ACTUALLY MORE EFFECTIVE. OR WAS OF A BETTER QUALITY THAN ANOTHER. AND A. THEY WERE BUT RECESSED INTO THE HOT. THE. IN THE DISCUSSION WE HAD FOUR YEARS AGO AND I KNOW YOU ARE HERE THAT. ONE OF THE VALUES OF ACTIVITY BASED COSTING WHICH ACTUALLY COME FROM THE EDUCATIONAL WORLD. THERE'S NOT JUST JUST DETERMINE. THE COST OF AN ACTIVITY BUT THE EFFICIENCY OF THE ACTIVITY. SO YOU TELLING ME. THAT. FROM THE UNIVERSITY. WHO TEACHES ACTIVITY BASED COSTING? DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY. TO DEVELOP A MODEL TO DEFINE. THE EFFICIENCIES AND EFFECTIVENESS IN THE COST. CURRENTLY WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA SYSTEMS TO BRING IN ALL THE DATA NEEDED FOR THE COMPLETE ANALYSIS ON OUR CAMPUSES. YOU KNOW NOT HERE BUT IT MAY BE AT A LATER TIME FOR A GET OUT HERE SO I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A. DISCUSSION WITH SOMEBODY FROM THE UC WHO WAS PUT IN A POSITION TO. MANAGE THIS PROCESS. COME TO MY OFFICE AND HAVE THIS PERSON COME IN. TAKE SOMETIME TO EDUCATE ME ON HOW YOU ATTEMPT THIS EFFORT. I YES SIR I CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN THANK YOU. SOME ARE TAKING YES I LIKE DEATH FORMER FINANCE ON. YOUR POSITION ON. WHETHER THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS. ADEQUATELY A PROPERLY ADOPTING THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS. WE'VE YET TO SEE UC'S EVIDENCE OF THE EVIDENCE IS DUE MAY FIRST. OF COURSE YOU'VE SEEN THE. JANUARY AUDIT REPORT BUT AS THE LA A SAID THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ACTIVITY SINCE JANUARY WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE UC'S EVIDENCE REGARDING AUDIT IMPLEMENTATION. AND WILL REVIEW IT THOROUGHLY. ARE THE PARTICULAR AREAS THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT AT THIS POINT. AT THIS TIME. AS AS THE THE ALIAS AT ONLY ONE OF THE AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED IS COMPLETED BY THE AUDITOR. THAT LEAVES NINE SO THERE THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR. TO IT TOOK DIDN'T THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S A LOT LEFT TO DO WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT. YOU SEE IS DONE AND AND WHAT THE AUDITOR'S RESPONSE TO WOULD USE HIS ACTIONS WERE START THINKING. THANK YOU I HAVE A. QUESTION THAT'S SOMEWHAT RELATED TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO BUT OUR OUR STAFF NOT SIT IN THE IN THE COMMENTS. WE'RE GOING TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOU SEE REQUEST AND CERTAINLY FRIEND STUDENTS AND ADVOCATES AS WELL. ABOUT. IT FULLY FUNDING THE YOU SEE TO IT TO MEET THEIR THE REQUEST OF THE OF THE SET SEGMENT. BUT THERE THERE REALLY ISN'T. RESOURCES FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH. WE WE KEEP IT THAT THE REQUEST CONTINUE THEIR ACCENT FROM LAST YEAR. SO ONE THING THAT WAS FOUND IN THE AUDITS. THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE ACTUALLY WORKED ON LAST YEAR. ARE THESE SYSTEM WIDE PROGRAMS INITIATIVES. AND THAT CAN EVALUATION IS AS FAR AS WHETHER OR NOT THOSE ARE STILL. ADEQUATELY RELEVANT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AS WHEN THEY WERE ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN GOING BACK TWENTY THIRTY OR SO LAST YEAR OF COURSE AS WE KNOW WE. WE'RE ABLE TO REDIRECT SOME OF THOSE FOUR. IN ENROLLMENT. EXPANSION AND WANTED TO ASK YOU SEE IT IS THAT. A CONTINUED. ACTION ITEM FOR YOU ALL BECAUSE THAT CERTAINLY WAS SOMETHING THAT THE AUDIT TALKED ABOUT WE TALKED ABOUT. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TALKED ABOUT SO. WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT. I YES THANK YOU SIR. THE YOU SEE OP AUDIT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN INCLUDED. SO DEFINING OF THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES WITHIN THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. AND THEY HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY REVIEWED AT THIS POINT. THE AUDIT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN HAVE INCLUDES WORK STREAMS FOR VARIOUS EXAMINING VARIOUS ASPECTS OF YOU CO P.. AND ONE OF THESE IS DEFINING THE SYSTEM WIDE INITIATIVES AND ESTABLISHING BUDGET TARGETS FOR EACH OF THEM. SO GOING FORWARD FROM HERE. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE MANAGEMENT REPORTING AND TO DRIVE BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF ALL PROJECT TRACKING AND ACCOUNTABILITY USE. AS THIS LIST THE PROGRAMS WILL BE REVIEWED ANNUALLY AND WILL BE PRESENTED TO THE REGION'S FOR CONSIDERATION OF WHICH PROGRAM SHOULD BE SCALED BACK AND WHICH ARE. UP PROVIDING USEFUL NEST BUT THE AMOUNT OF DOLLARS BEING. ALLOCATED TO EACH OF THOSE PROGRAMS SHARE WHAT I THINK THERE'S TWO PARTS OF THAT ANY TALKED ABOUT THE TRACKING IN TRANSPARENCY THAT'S. THAT'S A PART OF IT AND WE WEEK WE'VE HAVE THAT THE LAST TWO YEARS BUT AS FAR AS. MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS. TO TO POTENTIALLY DO SOMETHING ELSE WITH WITH THOSE RESOURCES SO WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS THE TIMELINE THAT WE COULD SEE. A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE REGENTS. AND THAT YOU SEE ON THAT CONCERT WITH SOMETHING THAT THAT WE COULD DO ON OUR OWN BUT HAVING FEEDBACK FROM. THE THE UC IS CERTAINLY HELPFUL. OF THE UC OP BUDGET WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE REGION'S AND THEIR MAY MEETING. AND. YOU HAVE IT AGENDA ITEM LATER ON DO YOU SEE A PIECE BUDGET SPECIFICALLY IMPACT STATE BUDGET DIRECTOR COULD DISCUSS THAT WITH YOU FURTHER AT THAT TIME. BUT GOING FORWARD THE EXECUTIVE DO YOU SEE PRESIDENT AND. THE FINANCE TEAM WITHIN UC OPIATE AS WELL AS THE STUDENT SERVICES ACADEMIC TEAMS WILL CONSIDER PROGRAMS THAT ARE NECESSARY AND. DEVELOP AN ANNUAL BUDGET FOR THE REGION'S TO CONSIDER AND CONTINUE. PROGRAMS THAT ARE PROVING TO BE EFFECTIVE. AND NOW THAT WE HAVE REALLY DONE A LOT OF THE BUDGET TRACKING WE HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF. OF WHICH PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDING RESULTS FOR THE DOLLARS SPENT. SO ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT THIS MAY NOT BE A RECOMMENDATION FOR FOR THIS. BUT BUDGET YEAR POTENTIAL ACTION AND REDIRECTION. HE SAID AS A MATE REPORT BUDGET REPORT COMING OUT FROM THE REGION'S WITH WOMEN BY THAT IN MAY THE REGION'S WILL CONSIDER THE USE YOUR P. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET. THE REDIRECTION OF FUNDS FOR INVOLVEMENT IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN HAS ALREADY BEEN. BROAD CATEGORIES HAVE BEEN DETERMINED. AND WORK COMMUNICATE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR THAT FOR THE NEXT YEAR OF COURSE UC'S DIFFERENT THAN CSU WEEK YOU KNOW BUDGET. FOR TWO YEARS IN ADVANCE FOR A FRIEND ROME ITSELF. THERE'S A GLARING GAP IN THAT THE ACTION WE'RE GONNA TAKE THIS YEAR WOULD HAVE. AT ZERO RESOURCES TO FURTHER EXPAND YOU SEE FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS SO. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR US WELL WE THINK THAT THE ACTIVITIES CURRENTLY UNDERTAKEN BY YOU SEE OPIUM THESE PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES CAMPED. VERY WELL BE REDIRECTED TO CAMPUSES FOR. ENROLLMENT OR OTHER ACTIVITIES BECAUSE YOU SEE OP HAS DISTINCT FUNCTIONS APART FROM THE CAMPUSES THAT ARE MORE EFFECTIVELY DONNA SYSTEM WIDE LEVEL. THOSE INCLUDE THINGS LIKE OUR BOND MANAGEMENT OUR INVESTMENTS ARE LEGAL. AND THEN THERE ARE CERTAIN SYSTEM WIDE INITIATIVES THAT CAN BE BETTER SERVED FROM A CENTRAL LOCATION SUCH AS OUR GLOBAL FOOD INITIATIVE. AND ALSO. SERVICES FOR DOCTOR STUDENTS. SO WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE. PLAN FOR ENDING ANY OF THOSE PROGRAMS WHERE IF YOU SEE OP FUNDING WERE TO BE REDUCED. SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS THAT. LEGISLATIVE MEMBERS ARE THAT SERVE A WIDE POPULATION ON OUR CAMPUSES. WOULD SUFFER. AND THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A SERIOUS DISCUSSION ABOUT. THE ELIMINATION YEAH. WELL I GUESS THAT'S A DESIRE FROM THE SUBCOMMITTEE IS WE WANT TO CONTINUE. TO TO LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE. WHEN WE'RE HOME IN OUR DISTRICTS CONSTITUENTS DON'T ASK ABOUT SOME PROGRAM. IT'S BURIED IN PAGE SEVEN HUNDRED OF THE REGION'S BUDGET THEY ASK. WHY CAN'T OUR? COMMUNITY MEMBERS GET INTO THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S THE ISSUE THAT WE HEAR NUMBER ONE AND IT'S WELL CAN USE YEAR AFTER YEAR AND SO I THINK WHAT WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU IS WE ARE COUNTING ON THE UC. TO WHAT WE ARE BURGER I DO OUR BEST TO TO FULLY FUND. THE UC BUDGET REQUEST LIKE WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ISSUE NUMBER TWO. BUT THAT PROVIDES NOT ONE PENNY TO EXPAND ACCESS YOU SEE ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIANS AND SOME. UP WE WANT TO CONTINUE LOOKING AT. THESE. THESE INITIATIVES THAT WERE OUTLINED IN THE AUDIT LAST YEAR THAT WE WENT OVER FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS IN OUR SUBCOMMITTEE. TWO LOOK AT POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES TO TO REDIRECT. NOT TO DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS OR SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE BUDGET. HEALTH CARE BUT TO REDIRECT. TO. THE REDIRECT TO YOU SEE FOR. ENROLLMENT EXPANSION. OUR PREFERENCE WOULD BE FOR NEW FUNDS TO EXPAND ENROLLMENT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO BEST SERVE THE STUDENTS THAT WE DO AN ROLE AND TO CONTINUE THE VARIOUS RESEARCH ACTIVITIES OF PUBLIC SERVICE THAT YOU SEE UNDERTAKES. IF THE UC OP BUDGET A SCALED BACK IT WOULD MEAN THAT WE WOULD HAVE FEWER. PUBLIC SERVICE PROGRAMS AND ALSO OUR RESEARCH MISSION. MIGHT SUFFER. YEAH. WHERE WHERE THAT RESPONSE THAT IS STILL OUR DESIRE TO TO TO TO DO WHAT I OUTLINED JUST A MOMENT? ALRIGHT THANK YOU SIR. COMMENTS WE COMMITTEE MEMBER SEAMEN. OKAY THANK YOU LOW PROCEED WITH ISSUE NUMBER TWO. BOB THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CONTINUES STATE INVESTMENT IN THE INTEREST OF CALIFORNIA. TO OPEN HERE A FEW QUICK FACTS ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY OF THE UC SYSTEM IN ROLES APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS AT ITS TEN CAMPUSES. AND AWARDED SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND DEGREES AND TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. AND IRRATIONAL FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS ARE SERVED BY USED EXTENSION PROGRAMS THESE HE WILL RECEIVE THREE POINT FIVE BILLION IN STATE GENERAL FUND AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. DESPITE GROWING CONCERNS REGARDING LONG TERM ECONOMIC GROWTH THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL INCREASES FUNDING FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL INCREASES THE UC BUDGET BY THREE PERCENT. A TOTAL INCREASE OF NINETY TWO POINT ONE MILLION. AND MAINTAINS THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN PRACTICE OF BUDGETING SEPARATELY FOR THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE EASY PATH PROJECT. ON THE SUBJECT OF TUITION THEIR MINISTRATIONS OPPOSED TO TUITION INCREASES THAT THE UC. THE UC SHOULD FOCUS INSTEAD ON REDUCING ITS COST STRUCTURE TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS AND FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE QUALITY EDUCATION THANK YOU. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE EIGHT OF YOUR AGENDA PROVIDES ON A MORE THOROUGH SORT OF BUDGET. DISPLAYED FOR YOU SEE AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AND THIS IS A BUDGET DISPLAY THAT WAS VERY INTERESTING UP PAGE EIGHT PAGE EIGHT OKAY. MY APOLOGIES IF I SAID THE WRONG NUMBER THERE. IF YOU OF THAT THIS IS A BUDGET THAT THE REGENTS DISCUSS THEY'VE NOT ADOPTED AT THEY HAVE ADOPTED SOME COMPONENTS OF IT BUT IT'S LARGELY SOMETHING THAT THE REGION'S HAVE DISCUSSED AND. ARE CONSIDERING ADOPTING AND IN MAY. WHAT WHAT THIS TABLE DOES SHOW ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE IS AVAILABLE FUNDS SOURCES THAT THE UNIVERSITY BELIEVE IS ANTICIPATING TO HAVE? NOT JUST GENERAL FUND BUT OTHER FUN SOURCES SUCH AS TUITION FROM STUDENTS ARE VERY SAVINGS THE UNIVERSITY INTENDS TO. ANCHOR AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. FUNDRAISERS LIKE THAT AND ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE. S. PLAYS HOW THE UNIVERSITY INTENDS TO SPEND THOSE FUNDS OFFER COMPENSATION INCREASES. I ENROLLMENT GROWTH STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THINGS OF THAT NATURE. OUR THIS BUDGET IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THEN THE GOVERNORS A PROPOSAL IT IT IT IT IT DISSIPATES MORE FUNDING THAN THE GOVERNOR. IS PROPOSING FOR EXAMPLE AT THIS BUDGET DOES ASSUME A TUITION INCREASE IT ALSO SEEMS ADDITIONAL STATE GENERAL FUND BUT. WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS IN JANUARY WE TRY TO SORT OF GAUGE UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HOW MUCH WOULD YOU NEVER YOU SEE HAVE TO WORK WITH AND. WE GET SHOULD HAVE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO WORK WITH AN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AND IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT COULD THEY DO WITH A THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WE ESTIMATED THAT COULD COVER A LOT OF THE COST INCREASES THEY ANTICIPATE AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THAT INCLUDES ALL OF THE. SORT OF WHAT THEY CALL THEIR MANDATORY COSTS THAT MANDATORY COST INCLUDES THINGS LIKE BENEFIT COST INCREASES. SOME BASIC SERVER COST INCREASES AND AT SOME COMPENSATION INCREASES SPECIFICALLY FOR. REP FOR REPRESENTED STAFF. BUT COULD ALSO COVER A LOT OF THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH THAT THE UNIVERSITY IS ANTICIPATING. AND SO THAT WAS WELL STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND EVEN AFTER THAT WOULD LEAVES OF ABOUT SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS LEFT OVER FOR OTHER SET OF PRIORITIES. THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS IDENTIFIED SUCH AS COMPENSATION INCREASES FOR FACULTY AND ON REPRESENTED STAFF SOME ADDITIONAL ROMAN GROWTH ACADEMIC EXCELLENT PROGRAMS THINGS OF THAT NATURE THEY CAN FIND ALL OF THOSE ADDITIONAL. OF PROGRAMS BUT IT'S A THAT HAVE TO PRIORITIZE AND. OF THAT AMOUNT WOULD DAYS TO REFUND UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. I DO THINKING ABOUT FUNDING FOR YOU SEE EITHER A FEW APPROACHES YOU CAN TAKE WHAT APPROACH YOU COULD TAKE HIS OF IT AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD APPROACH THE COMMITTEE HAS TAKEN IN PAST YEARS A SORT OF. YOU KNOW USE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET A SORT OF A STARTING POINT AND IF YOU THINK OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS A STARTING POINT I THINK OUR POINT HERE IS THAT. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET YOU SEE SERVE HAS A WORKLOAD BUDGET THEY HAVE ENOUGH TO SORT OF KEEP THE LIGHTS ON SEARCH SPEAK. AND SO THE ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS WHAT ADDITIONAL COST INCREASES BEYOND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. WOULD BE LIKE TO SORT OF FIND HOW MUCH MORE ENROLLMENT GROWTH WHAT COMPENSATION INCREASES THINGS OF THAT NATURE. YOU CAN ALSO YOU DON'T HAVE TO START THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL YOU COULD START FROM SORT OF THE GROUND UP AND TOOK A LOOK AT THESE COST INCREASES AND SAY WHICH OF THESE OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY. AND HOW WOULD WE LIKE TO. JULY COST AMONG THE VARIOUS FUNDS SOURCES AND IN THAT PRACTICE WE THINK YOU MIGHT FIND THAT SOME OF THESE. AREAS ARE OF HIGH PRIORITY TO YOU SOME OF THESE AREAS MIGHT NOT BE. FOR EXAMPLE IN PAST YEARS WE'VE NOTED CONCERNS WITH THE ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE PROPOSAL THAT YOU SEE HAS MADE IT'S IT'S A IT'S A PROPOSAL THEY'VE MADE FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS. AND IN GENERAL WE FOUND THAT PROPOSAL HASN'T HAD A LOT OF JUSTIFICATION A LOT OF BACK UP AND HOW CAMPUSES WOULD SPEND THE FUNDS. THEY PROVIDED A FEW EXAMPLES OF HOW THEY MIGHT USE THOSE FUNDS BUT IT'S ULTIMATELY UP FOR THE CAMPUS IS TO. BECAUSE OF THAT WE'RE CONCERNED AND IT MIGHT NOT EXACTLY MEET YOUR PRIORITIES AND YOU COULD PROBABLY DOESN'T MAKE THAT FUNDING A LITTLE MORE. A LITTLE MORE DID SORT OF ENSURE THAT ITS MEETING YOUR PRIORITIES FOR THE SYSTEM. I'M AND AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT FUNDING LEVELS WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT RATHER THAN SERVE THINK ABOUT WELL HOW MUCH OF THIS IS A FACING CHRIS HOW MUCH OF THIS IS A TUITION BY OUT YOU COULD THINK MORE AGAIN. CAREFULLY ABOUT BY COST INCREASES YOU'D LIKE TO SORT OF SUPPORT. AND THAT MIGHT PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE DETAILED AND MORE FOCUSED DISCUSSION. FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. I DID WANT TO TOUCH ON MOMENT ISSUES JUST A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THIS IS A TOPIC OF INTEREST TO THE LEGISLATURE. I'M WE DID I JUST WANT TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER THAT THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET DID SEVEN ROMAN TARGET FOR THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN YEAR. SO THAT A MOMENT TARGET IS IN PLACE AN ORDER DEFINE THAT YOU SEE REDIRECTED SOME. FUNDS WITHIN THEIR EXISTING SUPPORT BUDGET TO SUPPORT THAT GROWTH I'M AND YOUR AGENDA ON PAGE SEVEN PER AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE SEVEN PROVIDES A HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY OF. WHAT FUNDS YOU SEE SPECIFICALLY IS HOPING TO REDIRECT TO INTENDING TO REDIRECT FOR A MOMENT GROSS? I ONE VERY TECHNICAL THING JUST A POINT OF THE COMMITTEE EIGHT MILLION OF THAT COMES FROM THE. OFFICE THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET AND WE RECOMMEND THAT IF YOU IF YOU APPROVE OF THIS PLAN THAT YOU SUBTRACT THAT AMOUNT FROM THE YOU CO P. LINE ITEM AND TRANSFERRED TO THE CAMPUSES THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU SEE THIS OUR SHIFT THE FUNDS BACK TO THE CAMPUSES. I DO THINKING FORWARD ABOUT YOUR DECISIONS REGARDING NINETEEN TWENTY AND AND BEYOND THAT. I'M WE JUST THINK THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE WRAPPED UP IN SOME OF YOUR. CONSIDERATIONS FOR FRESHMAN ELIGIBILITY MY UNDERSTANDING IS YOU YOU HAD OF THAT PRETTY A DETAILED DISCUSSION ON THAT ON AND THE CSU HEARINGS I WANT GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN. I WAS VERY SIMILAR TO YOU SEE WE DO THINK THAT THEY ARE DRAWING FROM BEYOND THEIR THEIR SERVE MASTER PLAN PULLS. I'M AND SO AGAIN A SORT OF A QUESTION FOR YOU OF WHETHER OR NOT YOU LIKE TO EXPAND ELIGIBILITY OR OR SCALE BACK ELIGIBILITY AND THAT. WILL HAVE AN EFFECT ON WHAT YOU DO FOR FUN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. REGARDLESS THREE DECISIONS WE DO THINK THERE'S AN ADVANTAGE THE LEGISLATURE SORT OF ADOPTED FROM A POLICY THAT WOULD GUIDES FOR FUTURE OUT YOUR ENROLLMENT DECISIONS WE DO THINK THERE'S ADVANTAGE WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT TO. INCREASE OR DECREASE THE TO SORT OF HAVE A FORMAL POLICY IN PLACE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. S. UP OKAY. YOU SHOULD HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU A PACKET TITLED EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET REQUEST AND I WAS THINKING I WOULD JUST GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT FOR OUR BUDGET REQUESTS AS WE MOVE FORWARD THE FOR. THE SECOND SLIDE TO THEIR HOUSE TO UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OVERALL BUDGET. AND ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE PAGE YOU'LL SEE OUR THE TOTAL BUDGET FOR UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS. A MASSIVE COMPARED TO MOST STATE AGENCIES WHERE THIRTY FOUR AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS. OF THIS OUR MEDICAL CENTERS ARE ABOUT A THIRD. AND. COR FUNDS THAT WHICH ARE THE FUND THAT. BOB PAY FOR CAMPUS OPERATIONS THAT PAPER THE INSTRUCTION. FOUR PERCENT OF THE TOTAL UC BUDGET AND YOU'LL SEE THOSE REPRESENTED ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE PAGE. COR FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY MADE UP ABOUT FORTY PERCENT FROM STATE FUNDS AND WITH THE REMAINDER COMING FROM PRIMARILY STUDENT FEES. A THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT FROM TUITION. AND. ALMOST NINETEEN PERCENT FROM. NON RESIDENT TUITIONS WE GET OVER JUST ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FROM NON RESIDENT SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION. SO THAT'S. THOSE THAT'S THE CONTEXT WITHIN WHICH YOU'LL BE MAKING SOME OF THE BUDGET DECISIONS AND TOTAL COR FUNDS AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. ARE ABOUT THREE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. SO ONSITE THREE YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT REPRESENTATION OF WHAT'S SHOWN ON PAGE EIGHT OF YOUR AGENDA THESE ARE THE. PROPOSED CHANGES IN REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES FOR THE UC SYSTEM IN NINETEEN NINETEEN. THIS WAS INITIALLY PRESENTED TO THE REGENTS AT THEIR JANUARY MEETING BUT THEY DECIDED TO HOLD OFF ON VOTING ON IT BECAUSE IT INCLUDED A TUITION INCREASE AND THEY REQUESTED THAT WE COME BACK THAT THE LEGISLATURE. FOR A BUYOUT OF DOT TUITION INCREASE. THE UC SYSTEM HAS CERTAIN MANDATORY COSTA WE MUST PAY FOR THIS INCLUDE. OUR OUR. OUR. CONTRACTUALLY NEGOTIATED. PAYING CROESUS FOR UNIONS THEY INCLUDE MERITS FOR FACULTY. OF A CERTAIN HEALTH BENEFITS AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR. BUT FOR RETIREES AND CURRENT EMPLOYEES. THAT REALLY SHOULD BE FUNDED. AND NON SALARY PRICE INCREASES THEIR REGULAR INFLATION R. COSTA OCCURS ON. THINGS THAT ARE PURCHASED BY THE UNIVERSITY. AND THESE TOGETHER TOTAL ABOUT HUNDRED. AND THIRTY SIX MILLION WHICH IS MORE THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED IN HIS BUDGET AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TOTHE GOVERNOR. FOR THE FUNDS THAT WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDED IN THE. PROPOSED DANTON BUDGET BUT WE DO NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDS. WE'RE ALSO REQUESTING OR WE ARE ALSO HOPING FOR A. THREE PERCENT INCREASE FOR FACULTY AND NON REPRESENTED STAFF. UC FACULTY SALARIES ARE AT THIS POINT EIGHT POINT FOUR PERCENT BELOW OUR MARKET COMPARISON INSTITUTES. AND THAT'S NOT ACCOUNTING FOR THE TWENTY PERCENT. COST OF LIVING HIGHER COST OF LIVING IT WITH IN CALIFORNIA THAN IN MANY OF THE OTHER PLACES TO WHICH WE. LOSE OUR FACULTY. SO WE REALLY DO FEEL THAT WE NEED TO OFFER OUR FACULTY A PAY INCREASE IN OUR TO RETAIN THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST MINDS. ALSO OUR FACULTY ARE A GOOD INVESTMENT FOR THE STATE AS THEY BRING AND. JUST LAST YEAR THEY BROUGHT IN TWO POINT NINE BILLION IN FEDERAL GRANTS TO THE STATE THAT WOULD NOT HAVE COME INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITHOUT OUR FACULTY. AND THE RESEARCH THAT THEY CONDUCT SO THE MORE WE HAVE BRIGHT FACULTY WHO CAN GET THOSE GRANTS INTO THE STATE. THE MORE THEY'RE SORT OF PAYING FOR THEIR OWN OPERATIONS AND PROVIDING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF BENEFITS THROUGH THEIR RESEARCH. WHICH ENDS UP HELPING THE PUBLIC. ALRIGHT SO. THE NEXT. SLIDE INCLUDES OUR ACTUAL ADDITIONAL BUDGET SORRY ON WASN'T SPEAKING IN THE MIKE. THE NEXT SLIDE SLIDE FOR INCLUDES OUR. ADDITIONAL BUDGET REQUESTS ON TOP OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE ARE REQUESTING A SEVENTY MILLION DOLLAR BUYOUT OF STUDENT TUITION AND STUDENT SERVICES BEING INCREASES. US SIXTY MILLION OF THAT IS TUITION AND TEN MILLION THIS FOR STUDENTS SERVICES FREE. I WERE ALSO REQUESTING TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO ADDRESS THE IMPACTS OF REGION RECENT. A. ENROLLMENT GROWTH ABOVE WHAT WAS FUNDED BY. THE STATE TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR NEW ENROLLMENT GROWTH IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ON TOP OF THE FUNDS THAT WILL BE REDIRECTED. FROM. WITHIN UC'S BUDGET INCLUDING DATE MILLION DOLLARS FROM YOU CO PIECE BUDGET. AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR CRITICAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS. AND SLIDE FIVE SHOWS ADDITIONAL CONTACTS FOR. WHAT? HOW YOU SEE HAS BEEN FUNDED FOR THE LAST SEVENTEEN YEARS OR SO? BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE WE RECEIVED SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT ARE FUNDING FOR CAMPUSES FROM THE STATE. WITH STUDENT BEES COVERING ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. NOW STUDENT FEES ARE COVERING ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF OUR CAMPUS OPERATIONS IN THE STATE IS CONTRIBUTING ABOUT FORTY PERCENT. SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE THREE PERCENT INCREASE PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNOR IT APPLIES TO THE FORTY PERCENT. OF OUR CAMPUS OPERATIONS IT DOESN'T APPLY THAT THE SIXTY PERCENT OF PAYS FOR OTHER FUNDS. SO IN FACT THE THREE PERCENT INCREASE ENDS UP BEING WAY LESS THAN INFLATION BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT ONE POINT THREE PERCENT GROWTH ON OUR ENTIRE CORPS BUDGET. FOR THE CAMPUS AS. WHICH IS WHY WE WERE PROPOSING A TUITION INCREASE TO ALSO GET. THE INFLATIONARY COST PAID FOR BY THE OTHER COMPONENT OF THE BUDGET COVERED. AND WE'RE HOPING THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL BUY OUT THAT. BUT TUITION INCREASE THE AVAILABLE COR FUNDS PER STUDENT SHOWN THERE ON THE LEFT. HAVE GONE DOWN. WHEN ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION AND ALSO BECAUSE YOU SEE HAS ADDED NINETY TWO THOUSAND NEW STUDENTS SINCE TWO THOUSAND. SO THE PUMP FUNDS AVAILABLE PER STUDENT HAVE GONE DOWN DRAMATICALLY. EVEN THOUGH OUR STUDENTS ARE PAYING A LOT MORE NOW TO ATTEND THE UNIVERSITY THEM PREVIOUSLY. OUT OF THE BARS THERE ON SHOWN ON THE LEFT ALSO. WE HAVE TO PAY FOR CERTAIN COSTS. DOT. OTHER. OTHER UNIVERSITIES MIGHT NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR BY INCLUDING. US CS USE SO WE ARE COVERING ON BOND PAYMENTS OUT OF OUR OWN BUDGET OUR CORE BUDGET PAYS FOR BOND PAYMENTS. ON OUR CAMPUSES UP THREE HUNDRED FORTY SIX MILLION ESTIMATED IN CURRENT YEAR COMING OUT OF FUN STUFF WOULD OTHERWISE GO THE STUDENTS. ARE PAYING FOR A PASS CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS. THAT DEBT WAS SHIFTED ONTO THE UC BUDGET. BOKKEN I THINK TWENTY TEN. AND WE ARE NOW. PAYING FOR THAT. ALSO RECOVER OUR THE PAYMENTS INTO THE UC RETIREMENT PROGRAM OUT OF OUR. OWN FUNDS COR FUNDS ARE CONTRIBUTING ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED NINETY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS CURRENTLY. ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION COMING FROM ALL OF OUR FUNDS. GOING INTO UC RP ANNUALLY. AND OF COURSE ENROLLMENT HAS GONE UP DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME. SLIGHT SIX PROVIDES YOU WITH SOME CONTEXT ON OUR TUITION AMOUNTS. OF FOR THE LAST SEVENTEEN YEARS OR SO. UP IF WE DO RECEIVED THE BUY OUT OF TUITION STUDENTS WOULD ACTUALLY SEE A SMALL DECREASE. IN THEIR TUITION AMOUNTS BY SIXTY DOLLARS ANNUALLY BECAUSE CURRENTLY. WE HAVE A CHARGE CALLED FOR A LAWSUIT CULT LIQUID I THINK THAT WE ARE STILL PAYING OFF FOR. AND THE LAST PAYMENT ON THE LAWSUIT WILL BE MADE IN FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AFTER THE LAWSUIT IS FULLY PAID OFF THE REGION'S WERE GOING TO CONTINUE THE CHARGE BUT THEN PUT IT THE WORD INSTRUCTION. THAT WAS THE REGION'S PROPOSAL FOR THE TUITION INCREASE. AND WE'RE HOPING THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL BY IT OUT SO THAT WE CAN PUT THOSE FUNDS TO WORK CAMPUS INSTRUCTION. AND HIGHER HIGHER MORE LECTURERS AND FACULTY WITH THAT. OUR TUITION AND STUDENT SERVICES BE FUNDS ARE CRITICAL TO MEETING THE. NEEDS OF THE UNIVERSITY TO PROVIDE A QUALITY EDUCATION FOR OUR STUDENTS. AND TO SLIDE SEVEN. THIS ARE REFLECTS THE OUR REQUEST FOR THE ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. DO THEY CARE STUDENTS THAT WERE BROUGHT IN ON TOP OF THE TARGET SET BY THE LEGISLATURE. IN AUG TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN. SO THE LOW LET'S JUST THE BUDGET BILLING WHICH FOR THOSE YEARS. STATE AT THAT THE UC HAD TO ENROLL AT LEAST OF FIVE THOUSAND AND THEN TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NEW STUDENTS. OUR CAMPUSES. MADE A LOT OF OFFERS BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO MEET THOSE. MEET THAT ON ENROLLMENT TARGETS AND WE ENDED UP ENROLLING. UP ABOUT TEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED A NEW. CALIFORNIA RESIDENT UNDERGRADS DURING THAT TIME AND WE ARE REQUESTING. TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO. COVER THE MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION FOR THOSE STUDENTS SO THAT. WE CAN HIRE MORE LECTURERS AND FACULTY AND. STUDENT SUPPORT STAFF. TO REALLY OFFERED THEM THE SAME QUALITY OF SERVICE THAT. PRIOR GENERATIONS IN PRIOR YEARS OF STUDENTS HAD AT UC. WHEN MOVING ON IN THE PRESENTATION TO SLIDE EIGHT. THE IMPACT OF NOT HAVING MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION COVERED. FULLY AND THE IMPACT OF HAVING THE UC CUT. BY ONE BILLION DOLLARS FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TO TWENTY ELEVEN EVEN THOUGH THAT. FUNDING HAS NOW BEEN RESTORED WE'RE ABOUT AT THE SAME LEVEL OF FUNDING AS WE WERE THEN. AND WE'RE ACTUALLY AT THE SAME LEVEL OF STATE FUNDING US WE WERE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND. THE IMPACT IS THAT STUDENT SATISFACTION APPEARS TO BE DECLINING MORE STUDENTS ARE SAYING THAT THEY'RE NOT CERTAIN IF THEY WOULD COME TO THE UC AGAIN AND IT WASN'T THE KIND OF EXPERIENCE. BUT THEY WERE TOLD THAT IT WOULD BE BY. THEIR PARENTS ARE. OF FAMILY FRIENDS WHO WENT BEFORE THEM. AND SHOT QUITE. DISTRESSINGLY BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SIX AND TWENTY SIXTEEN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO SAID THEY COULD NOT GET INTO THEIR MAJOR. WENT UP FROM THREE PERCENT TO THIRTEEN PERCENT. THIS IS BECAUSE THE FACULTY ONLY CERTAIN NUMBER STUDENTS CAN GET INTO A MAJOR IF THE FACULTY HAVEN'T BEEN HIRED. AND. THERE ARE CERTAIN MAJORS WHERE STUDENTS WANT TO GO BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT THAT'S. THAT WILL LEAD TO A WELL PAYING JOB AFTER THEY GRADUATE OR IT'S THEIR PERSONAL INTEREST. AND THEY REALLY WANT TO STUDY THAT SUBJECT AREA BUT THEY FIND THAT THEY GET INTO YOU SEE. AND THEY CAN'T GET INTO THE MAJOR AND THAT'S A VERY DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE ALSO MORE STUDENTS ARE FINDING THAT THEY FEEL LESS CONNECTED THE FACULTY. WHO ARE? TEACHING THEM BECAUSE THOSE CLASSES ARE SO MUCH LARGER INSTEAD OF BEING IN A CLASS WITH FORTY STUDENTS OR SIXTY STUDENTS LEARN A CLASS WITH HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS. AND THEY DON'T GET ANY FACE TO FACE TIME PERSONALLY WITH THE FACULTY MEMBER. THEY FEEL LESS CONNECTED TO THE. TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INSTRUCTING THEM. AND ALSO ON SLIDE NINE. WHILE WE'RE EXTREMELY HAPPY THAT. ARE YOU OUR M. STUDENTS HAVE BEEN GOING UP FROM ABOUT TWENTY TWO PERCENT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TO ABOUT. THIRTY THREE PERCENT AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN. FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER WE SAW GOD GRADUATIONRATES. A DROP FOR YOU ARE AND STUDENTS IN THE LAST ABOUT DECADE. SO IF YOU LOOK ON THE SPREADSHEET THERE. ON THE RIGHT THE AFRICAN AMERICAN FIVE YEAR GRADUATION RATE TOOK A SLIGHT. PERCENTAGE. DROP. AS DID DE UM AMERICAN INDIAN AND THE HISPANIC LATINO GRADUATION RATES ALL DROPPED. WHEN YOU'RE OVER NEXT AND DOC MEANS THE. THE TWENTY TEN THERE MEANS THAT THOSE WERE THE STUDENTS WHO STARTED STARTED IN FALL TWENTY TEN. ITS LOOKING AT THEIR GRADUATION RATES. THIS IS A REAL IMPACT ON STUDENTS. OF. OF NOT HAVING THE FACULTY TO TEACH THEM OR HAVING FEWER SUPPORT STAFF DO ADVISED THEM. PROVIDE FINANCIALLY COUNSELING. AND SO FORTH. SO WE ARE SEEING SOME REAL IMPACTS AND WE WOULD WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE US WITH TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO TAKE CARE OF OUR EXISTING STUDENTS. AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO CONTINUE AND ROLLING DO STUDENTS IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO PROVIDE MORE ACCESS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. AND WITHOUT ALL PIXEL QUESTIONS. MR MEDINA. BEN COULDN'T COULDN'T PROVIDE FOR FOR ME. I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTOOD CHARGE. OUT OF THAT INDICATE. DROP. YEAH GRADUATION RATES WITH YOU. WHAT? YES. WOULD BE THE TRACK WITH A BIT MORE YEAH I WILL WALK YOU THROUGH IT SO ON. THE. A COLUMN ETHNICITY IS OBVIOUSLY THE ETHNICITY OF THE STUDENT A SELF STATED TIME TO GRADUATIONS THE NUMBER OF YEARS IT TOOK THEM FROM ENROLLING FIRST TO GRADUATING. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE COLUMN THAT SAYS TWENTY TEN THOSE ARE STUDENTS THAT STARTED IN FALL TWENTY TEN. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE GRADUATION RATE THEIR TWENTY TEN AND THE COHORT THAT STARTED IN TWENTY ELEVEN. FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN THE FIVE YEAR GRADUATION RATE DROPPED SLIGHTLY. THE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE ALSO DROPPED TO SAY. THE CAPTAIN. FORTY SIX. QUIRK QUIRK TWO THOUSAND NINE. FOR YOUR RATE IS FORTY SIX. IS THAT. FORTY SIX. SENATE. OF AFRICAN AMERICAN TO THE WORLD IN TWO THOUSAND WE DIDN'T FOR YEAR. THAT'S CORRECT. SO IF YOU. IMPROVED IN TWO THOUSAND TEN. SO IT DID IMPROVE YES THE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE AND TWENTY TWO TWELVE WAS HIGHER THAN TWO THOUSAND NINE SO THE OVERALL RATE HAS BEEN GOING UP. BUT WE DID SEE A SLIGHT DROP IN THE FIVE YEAR GRADUATION RATE. AND THE. IF WE COULD WE LOWER LA I I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE. A. THE GRAPH ON PAGE NINE. OVERLAID. WITH THE. WITH STATE INVESTMENT CAN WE DO THAT CAN YOU GET THAT FOR ME YES I CAN GET THAT FOR YOU SIR LIKE I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE A GROUP WHICH. IN OTHER WORDS I I WANT TO SEE. HOW? RELATIONSHIP. BETWEEN THE STATE INVESTMENT IN YOU SEE. THE INCREASED MINORITY. INVESTMENT AND WE OVERLAYS THOSE. TOGETHER. I THINK WE WOULD SEE A DECLINE. A IN STATE INVESTMENT IN UC AS WE SEE. AN INCREASE IN MINORITY ENROLLMENT SO IF IF WE COULD PROVIDE ME WITH THAT YES I WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH THAT SIR. APPRECIATE. ANNA AND I WAS HEARTENED TO HEAR. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S. SAY THAT WE CAN CONSIDER THE GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSED BUDGET PROPOSAL AS JUST THAT AS A STARTING OFF POINT. IT'S VERY HARD TO HEAR THAT. AND AS A A PLACE FOR MOVING FROM THERE. SO I'M HEARTENED THIS MORNING. THANK YOU. MR MARTZ ITCHING THANK YOU. QUESTION FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. DIRECTING YOUR ATTENTION TO THE GRAPH ON PAGE FIVE OF YOUR HAND OUT. ARE THE GRAPH ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE. WELL YOU HAVE THE. COR FUNDS FROM TWO THOUSAND TO. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. SO THE STATE GENERAL FUNDS. BOTH IN TWO THOUSAND AND IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IS AROUND THREE BILLION. THAT'S CORRECT SIR IN FACT THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN AMOUNT IS UP ABOUT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN IN TWO THOUSAND. NOT INFLATION ADJUSTED OKAY BUT. AND TERMS OF. YOUR POINT THAT THE THE PORTION OF THE STATE GENERAL FUND DROPPING FROM SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. TO FORTY PERCENT. AND THAT SEVENTEEN YEAR TIME SPAN. THAT AT LEAST IN TERMS OF. THE NOMINAL DOLLARS TO. THAT IS. PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE INCREASING. BARS THEY INCREASING BECAUSE I COSTS OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. SEC WRECKED. A THAT'S CORRECT SERB BETWEEN. TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY SEVENTEEN YEARS OF INFLATION CAUGHT ON COSTS FOR THE UNIVERSITY WE ALSO ADDED. NINETY TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS DURING THAT TIME WHO ALL NEEDED EXPENDITURE AND TWENTY. TEN UC PUT IN PLACE OF. A REINSTATED THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RETIREMENT PROGRAM PAYMENTS WHICH ARE NOW FOURTEEN PERCENT OF PAYROLL FOR THE EMPLOYER. CONTRIBUTION AND I BELIEVE IT WAS. IT'S A. ABOUT IT'S OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THAT WE HAVE TO PAY. TOWARD YOU SEE OUR PIECE OF THERE'S COSTS THAT CAME ON LINE THAT DIDN'T EXIST BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOR THE UNIVERSITY. IN ADDITION TO THE UC RP COSTS WE NOW HAVE TO PAY FOR THE CAPITAL OUTLAY BONDS WHICH AFTER TWO THOUSAND EIGHT FINANCIAL CRISIS WERE SHIFTED ONTO THE UC'S BUDGET. FROM THE STATE SO WE ARE NOW MAKING DE INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON. CAPITOL AWFULLY PROJECTS CONSTRUCTED FOR THE UNIVERSITY OKAY I'LL TRY TO KEEP UP WITH EVEN WITH IT. THERE ABOUT WHAT ARE THE TOP THREE. ACCOST DRIVERS FROM TWO THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE TOP THREE COST DRIVERS I WOULD SAY WERE THE INCREASED OUR ENROLLMENT BY NINETY TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS. THE UC RP YOU SEE RETIREMENT PROGRAM PAYMENTS WHICH ARE NOW FOUR HUNDRED NINETY FOUR MILLION. ENCOURAGE YOUR. AND THE BOND PAYMENTS WERE TARA THREE HUNDRED FORTY SIX MILLION ANNUALLY. AND THAT'S FOR THE CAPITAL OUTLAY. YES. AND SO THOSE ARE COMING OUT OF THAT. LARGELY OUT OF THAT STATE FUNDING. SLICE OF THE PIE FOR THE CAPABLY OKAY AND THEN. TURNING TO THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH THE NINETY TWO THOUSAND ADDITIONAL STUDENTS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND THAT THAT INCLUDES BOTH. CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AS WELL AS OUT OF STATE AND FOREIGN STUDENTS. A I BELIEVE SO YES. AND. AYE IT'S RELATED TO. YOUR CHART ON PAGE SEVEN BUT THE NINETY TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS DID DO YOU WERE. WELL LIKE I SAID THE CHART ON PAGE SEVEN IS. STRICTLY FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. YES THOUGH SO THOSE SLIDE SEVEN ONLY INCLUDES CALIFORNIA RESIDENT OKAY AND AND THAT INCLUDES BOTH UNDERGRADUATES AND GRADUATE STUDENTS. OH YES THIS IS BOTH OUR CALVET OF CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES. ACTUALLY. I BELIEVE CERT THIS. CHART IS ACTUALLY FOR UNDERGRADUATES ONLY. OUR RANGE. BUT. IN TERMS OF THE. AND ROAMING GROWTH. GOT BEING THE NUMBER ONE COST DRIVER FOR THE INCREASING. BAR GRAPHS. AT IT AT LEAST AND THEN IT IS IS NOT FAIR TO SAY THAT. THAT THE. DRAMATICALLY INCREASING TUITION REVENUES. AND SIGNIFICANT PART COVERED THOSE THEN ROAMING GROWTH GIVEN THAT THIS ALSO INCLUDES ADDED STAY STUDENTS AND THE THE FOSTER. OF THAT'S CORRECT REVIEWS TUITION INCREASES AND WE'VE ADDED NONRESIDENT STUDENTS TO HELP COVER THE UNIVERSITIES INCREASING COSTS. THE GOLDEN BAR THERE THAT STATES YOU SEE GENERAL FUNDS THIS IS ON SLIDE FIVE. ON THE LEFT THERE THE UC GENERAL FUNDS IS OUR NON RESIDENT SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION. AND A FEW VERY SMALL. OTHER FUNDING SOURCES LIKE PATENT REVENUE BUT THERE'S A BILLION DOLLARS OF NON RESIDENT SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION DARKENED SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. AND SO WE USE THAT WE ENROLLED THOSE NON RESIDENT STUDENTS. IN ORDER TO HAVE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM THEM TO HELP SUPPORT OUR RESIDENTS STUDENTS. IF THEY PAY MORE THAN YES SIR BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN EDUCATION OKAY. AND THEN. SWITCHING BACK TO THE GRAPH ON PAGE SEVEN SO. THE. CAPS IS ADDING SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FULL TIME ENROLLMENT CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES AT AND THIS IS JUST. FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN TO. WHAT YEAR? OF TWENTY FIFTEEN TO FALL. TWENTY SEVENTEEN OKAY. AND A JUDGE AT LEAST SAID THEY. I KNOW CHARTS CAN BE DECEIVING BUT THIS THIS DOES SEEM TO BE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE AND. AND. CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT ENROLLMENT IS THAT ALL YET SAY BATTED. SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN TO NOW WE'VE ADDED. TEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED CALIFORNIA RESIDENT STUDENTS. AND. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE BUDGETS OF TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN. IT'S WITH. SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE AGREED UPON MARGINAL. STATE COST FOR THOSE STUDENTS. SO WHEN WE ENROLLED THE FIVE THOUSAND NEW. CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADS AND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN OR FOR FALL FIFTH SIXTEEN BECAUSE WE ALWAYS. ARE IN ACTUAL INVOLVEMENT IN ROLLING OFF THE STUDENTS AT BY YEAR BEHIND FROM WHEN WE GET THE FUNDS. BUT WHEN WE'RE SPEAKING ABOUT GETTING THE FUNDS. IT WAS ABOUT A HALF THE MARGINAL COST. IT'S THE USUAL STATE CHAIR SO WE GOT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT INSTEAD OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT. OUR CALCULATED COSTS FOR EDUCATING AN UNDERGRADUATE IS ABOUT NINETEEN THOUSAND A YEAR. OF WHICH NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS COMES FROM STUDENT FEES AND THEN THE TEN THOUSAND COMES. HOPEFULLY FROM THE STATE. NOW. I AGREE WITH YOU CHAIR THAT. THAT. YOU KNOW THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN WE HEAR FROM OUR CONSISTENT WAY OF JUST SPEAKING FOR MYSELF FOR MY CONSTITUENTS IT IS YOU KNOW WHY IT IS SO MUCH HARDER FOR MY KID TO GET INTO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA NOW. THEN WHEN THEIR PARENTS WENT. EN AND WHICH IS WHY YOU KNOW I. AGREE WITH THE CHAIR THAT TO ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES IS THE ENROLLMENT ACCESS. VERY. I I'M I'M HEARING. MORE MORE FROM THE CURRENTLY ENROLLED THE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS THAT. THE THE THE OVERCROWDING NATURE OF OF THE CAMPUSES AND SO I I'D LIKE TO ACTUALLY TURN TO THE LA JOH. NA I BELIEVE YOU HAD A STUDY. MAYBE ONE OR TWO YEARS AGO WERE WHERE YOU FELT THAT WAY. I BELIEVE ONE OF YOUR CONCLUSIONS WITH WAS THAT THE. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES ACTUALLY HAD ENOUGH CAPACITY TO ADMIT MORE. UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS IT IS IS THAT STILL YOUR OPINION. RIGHT SO WHAT THAT STUDY DID IS IT WAS TRYING TO ANSWER WHETHER OR NOT. AND A NEW CAMPUS EITHER IT USE YOUR SEARS HE WAS JUSTIFIED. AND THE GAUGE THAT WE LOOK AT BOTH AT THE EXISTING CAPACITY AS WELL AS. YOU KNOW WHAT IF THEY WERE TO CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT THOSE CAMPUSES BASED ON THEIR SORT OF LONG RANGE PLANS AND WE FOUND BASED ON THAT AND YOU CAMPUS WASN'T JUSTIFIED BUT NOT JUST WAS NOT JUSTIFIED IN TERMS OF EXISTING SPACE WE DO THINK THERE'S SOME EXISTING SPACE THERE. ON A SEVERAL THE CAMPUSES HOW ARE HAVE SOMEWHAT LOWER USE AND THE FALL THROUGH SPRING. AND THEIR LITTLE CAMPUSES ARE ALSO THERE ABOUT ABOUT. THAT THEIR THEIR SUMMER USES BELOW KIND OF EXPECTATIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS CERTAIN PLACE SO THERE'S ALSO OF CAPACITY TO ADD IN THE SUMMER TOO SO THERE'S SOME SOME WE DO THINK I HAVE SOME EXISTING SPACE. THAT MORE STUDENTS HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT WITH YOU PERHAPS ANECDOTAL LA TESTIMONY THEY'VE HEARD FROM STUDENTS ABOUT. HOW THEY THAT THEY FEEL THAT? DID.% THE CAMPS IS NOW ARE ARE READY OVER ENROLLED IN AN OVER ENACTED YET IT'S HARD TO GAUGE THE THE DATA WE SEE WITH. ANECDOTAL EXAMPLES WE I THINK ONE. EXPLANATION THAT WE THAT WE'VE HEARD IS THAT. SOMETIMES CAMPUSES ARE. YOU KNOW VERY BUSY AT PEAK TUESDAY AND THURSDAY YOU AND IN THE AFTERNOON. OR THEY MAY HAVE LESS USED FOR EXAMPLE ON FRIDAYS THEY MIGHT HAVE LESS USE IN THE SUMMER SO THAT SO I THINK THAT'S. PART OF WHAT POTENTIALLY COULD BE GOING ON THERE WHEN WHEN WE CERVANTES ANECDOTES OF OVERCROWDING AND ON AND IT'S ALSO IT'S ALSO I'M WITHIN CERTAIN COURSES TO THERE MIGHT BE CERTAIN VERY VERY HIGH DEMAND COURSES WHERE. THERE IT'S HARD TO GET INTO THERE MIGHT BE OTHER COURSES WHERE THERE'S LESS ENROLLMENT DEMAND SO THAT THAT COULD BE ANOTHER ELEMENT THERE TO. WHAT IS A UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S POSITION AS TO WHETHER YOU HAVE? SUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO TO ADD FURTHER. ENROLLMENT GROWTH THANK YOU SIR FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND. UP WE HAVE LIMITED CAPACITY FOR NEW INVOLVEMENT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TWO CAMPUSES THAT HAVE. UNUSED CLASSROOM SPACE THERE ARE BERKELEY AND LOS ANGELES WHERE THESE CLASSROOMS AREN'T VERY OLD BUILDINGS AND ACTUALLY SEAT FEWER THAN FIFTEEN STUDENTS. THEY'RE NO LONGER PRACTICAL FOR THE MODERN UNIVERSITY. WHERE WE HAVE TO HAVE FORTY FIFTY TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS IN A SINGLE CLASS? THAT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TO RUN A FIFTEEN STUDENT. COURSE WE KNOW TO DEVOTE A FACULTY MEMBER TO THAT SORT WE REALLY NEED ON THOSE CAMPUSES FUNDS TO. UP RENOVATE THE INSIDE OF THOSE BUILDINGS WITH LARGER CLASSROOM SPACE SO JUST LOOKING AT SQUARE FOOTAGE THAT'S GOING ON USED ON TWO CAMPUSES IS NOT SUFFICIENT. UP I WOULD NOTE THAT THE OTHER CAMPUSES ARE IT OUGHT NINETY PERCENT OR ABOVE A HUNDRED PERCENT SPACE UTILIZATION FOR THEIR CLASSROOMS. THE SPACE UTILIZATION BEING LOOKED AT MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY EIGHT AM THREE FIVE PM SO THEY'RE RUNNING CLASSES. IN THE EVENINGS SOME ARE OFFERING NOW THEM ON WEEKENDS. WE ARE TRYING TO INCREASE SUMMER ENROLLMENT TO TAKE SOME PRESSURE OFF OF THE FALL AND SPRING. WE FIND STUDENTS VERY RESISTANT TO ENROLL IN SUMMER AND THIS COULD HAPPEN BECAUSE FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID UP UNTIL THIS LAST SUMMER AS NOT AVAILABLE. SERVICE ENDED FOR AWHILE AND IT AND CAL GRANTS ARE. A STUDENT CAN CHOOSE THE NUMBER TERM OR WHICH TERMS WITHIN THE YEAR TO USE CALTRANS FOR. MOST CHOOSE TO USE THEIR CALDERON IN FALL AND SPRING. UP BECAUSE IF THEY USE THEM IN THE SUMMER AND THEY'RE EITHER NOT AVAILABLE IN THE FALL OR SPRING SO. SOMETHING FOR THE LEGISLATURE PERHAPS TO EXAMINE ON WHETHER OR NOT CAL GRANTS COULD ALSO BE UTILIZED BY STUDENTS IN SUMMER. BUT SOME OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE PILOT PROJECTS TO TRY AND INCREASE SUMMER ENROLLMENT AND IN FACT SAN DIEGO OFFERED FREE HOUSING FOR STUDENTS AND THEY STILL DIDN'T GET TAKERS. SO QUITE RADICAL. WHO HAD KNOWS THAT THE STEPS CAMPUS OF TRYING TO GO TO? TO GET STUDENTS TO ENROLL IN SUMMER BUT ON THEIR NOT REALLY GETTING TAKERS FOR THAT. pALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY I KNOW THAT SOMEONE MEMBER LIMON HAS A HAS A QUESTION IS WHEN INTERJECT ON TO THINGS THAT THAT YOU'VE MENTIONED MR MARTZ ITCHY. SO THE FIRST IS THAT I I CONCUR THAT THE STATE HASN'T STEPPED UP AND FUNDING THE THE YOU SEE. IN THE LAST DECADE IN. A LOT WAS TO THE RECESSION WAS AND IS HER HIDING HER. MALICE EVEN BEFORE WE WERE HERE. I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. THAT THERE'S ANOTHER BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE PUT INTO THE UC FROM THE GENERAL FUND THROUGH OUR CAL GRANT PROGRAM SO WHILE TUITION HAS GONE UP. TREMENDOUSLY THOUGHT ALL FAMILIES THAT ARE PAYING THAT FAMILIES ARE. BUT FOR MANY STUDENTS IT'S THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WRITING A CHECK BE OUR CAL GRANT PROGRAM SO. IT'S ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE. IF TO THE UC EVERY YEAR THROUGH THE STUDENT COMMISSION. AND THEN ON THE ON THE IN ENROLLMENT ISSUE I I YOU KNOW THIS BECAUSE YOU SAID. I MISTER MURATSUCHI THIS IS AT THE TOP PRIORITY AND WE TALK TO THE CHANCELLOR'S AND AND THEY HAVE FRANKLY GIVE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT POSITION THAN YOU. THEY'RE SAYING THAT THERE IS CAPACITY WE HAVE TALKING TO THE PRESIDENT AND YOUR TEAM OVER THE YEARS AND AND AND YOU HAVE ALLUDED TO THAT THERE IS CAPACITY TO GROW. BY A FEW THOUSAND STUDENTS PER YEAR GRANTED WE ALSO HEAR THAT. CURRENT. PEOPLE ON CAMPUS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO FOCUS ON THE. CLASS RATIOS AND AND OTHER ON CAMPUS ON. THAT NEEDS BUT I DON'T THINK THOSE THINGS ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE AND THAT IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE GOING TO CONTINUE. TO TO PRESS ON. ESPECIALLY WITH SOME OF THE CAMPUS AS YOU NOTED. MERCED AND RIVERSIDE BUT ALSO SET UP SOME OF THE OTHERS SAN DIEGO AND. DAVIS WE KNOW THAT THERE THERE IS CAPACITY TO GROW AND AND I'M LEAVING OUT A FEW OTHER SWELL AND I WILL COME BACK WITH SOME OTHER ISSUES BUT AS SOMEONE I REALLY MUST. THANK YOU AND. AND AND AS SOMEONE WHO WORKED THERE. SPACE IS ALWAYS COVERED AND AND I MEAN EVERYONE WAS USING STEPPED LOUNGES. EXTRA ROOMS AND LIBRARIES TO HOST A CLASSROOM SO I. I MEAN THAT'S CHANGED A LOT WHERE IT'S REALLY HARD TO GET. A CLASSROOM IF YOU'RE NOT A REGULAR CLASS. THAT MEETS ON A WEEKLY BASIS AND YOU NEED IT FOR OTHER PURPOSES. MY QUESTION ACTUALLY HAS TO DO WITH HURT NUMBER SIX. OKAY ON PAGE SIX I. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THIS CHARTER YOU COULD IMMEDIATELY SEE THAT THERE WERE TWO THREE. YEAR PERIODS WHERE. THE INCREASE IN TUITION WENT UP. SIGNIFICANTLY. I'M MUCH MORE SO THAN ALL THE OTHER YEARS ADDED UP. AND THOSE THREE PERIODS ALSO COINCIDED WITH ROUGH SPOTS IN OUR STATE'S ECONOMY. AND THEY COINCIDED WITH KEY TWELVE SEEN MAJOR CUTS. AND I AS YOU LOOK AT THIS YOU CAN ALSO ANTICIPATE THAT. WE AS A STATE WILL HIT THOSE ROUGH PATCHES AS WELL SO IN ADDITION TO THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS ARE. HOW DOES THE YOU SEE PLAN OR THINK ABOUT ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE REALLY ROUGH PATCHES BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT? BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND FIVE AND TWO DOZEN NINETY DOESN'T SOLVE. I MEAN THAT THE BOOK OF WHEN IT HAD THESE TUITION INCREASES IT WENT UP HOW DO WE PREPARE FOR THE NEXT TIME THIS HAPPENS ON WILL WE ALSO EXPECT TO SEE. AN INCREASE AYE GO UP WITH AND THAT DRAMATICALLY A EVERYTHING ELSE IS A FEW DIGITS HERE AND THERE BUT THEN YOU SEE TWELVE. A THIRTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SIX PERCENT THAT'S I MEAN THAT THE BULK OF IT. OH YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER THERE'S. THERE ARE SEVERAL YEARS THAT COINCIDED WITH DRAMATIC STATE FUNDING CUTS WHERE THE UNIVERSITY TURN TO THE STUDENTS TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS WE'VE THE PRESIDENT NOW HAS TO THE OF EXECUTIVE FINANCE COMMITTEE THAT IS. I'M COMPOSED OF CHANCELLORS AND CAMPUS AYE NANCE LEADERSHIP THAT IS THINKING ABOUT LONG TERM HOTTEST UNIVERSITY ATTAIN. FINANCIAL SECURITY SO THAT WE WOULD NEVER HAVE A TUITION INCREASE OF GREATER THAN FIVE PERCENT THAT'S THE LONG TERM GOAL THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO GET TO. SOME OF THESE. STEPS INCLUDE THINGS LIKE REQUESTING THAT IF. WE GET A FACULTY ENDOWMENT IT FACULTY ENDOWMENTS USE TO JUST BEFORE THE FACULTIES RESEARCH. THAT WE MAKE IT. A REQUIREMENT THAT THE FACULTY SALARY A COMPONENT OF IT ALSO HAS TO BE ON THAT ENDOWMENT. THAT WOULD THEN FREE UP. STATE FUNDS FOR OTHER PURPOSES AND IT WOULD ALSO MAKE THAT FACULTY POSITION MORE SECURE. SO THAT'S SOME THAT'S ONE ASPECT OF WERE THINKING ABOUT WE'RE LOOKING TO PHILANTHROPY FOR COMPONENT OF THAT AND. UNFORTUNATELY I'LL HAVE TO COME BACK TO YOU LATER WITH UP WITH ACTUAL WITH PLANS THAT ARE BEING FORMULATED. I AM I AM I AM I AM I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT PLANS ARE BEING DEVELOPED AND I MEAN THE IDEA THAT IN THE ROUGHEST OF TIMES FOR THE STATE WHERE WE SEE CUTS ALL AROUND. THERE MAY BE A WORLD WHERE WE WON'T SEE A THIRTY PERCENT INCREASE. INTUITION. AND I KNOW THAT THAT DOESN'T COME LATELY SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WHEN THOSE CONVERSATIONS IMPLANTS COME THAT. AND WE CAN HAVE WE CAN YOU KNOW BE UPDATED ON THAT'S BECAUSE I THINK IT'S. IT'S GONNA HAPPEN WE KNOW THAT AT SOME POINT OUR STATE WILL HIT ANOTHER ROUGH. YES ONCE ONCE THERE IS A PLAN THAT. IS SHAREABLE I WILL DEFINITELY BRING IT TO YOU. OKAY. A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS BEFORE WE MOVE ON I DID WANT TO TO ASK ABOUT THE. LUKE CATHOLIC CREDIT DECISION. THE FACT FINANCING INCORRECTLY LOOK QUETTA LA CUENTA YEAH THIRD ONE GAME SAID THEY WANT. SO I I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THE DECISION THE RATIONALE. I'M SUB SOMEWHAT CONFUSED ON THE REQUEST FOR THE ADDITIONAL MONEY IT'S KIND OF FREE MONEY THAT YOU'RE ASKING THE STATE TO TAKE INTO TO HELP. GO THE CAMPUS LEVEL BUT WHY WOULDN'T WE CONSIDER USING. THAT. IS IT A MILLION OR NINE. IT WERE NINE MILLION. TO EXPAND ACCESS I GUESS THIS IS THE YOU THAT THE QUESTION THAT WE'RE DEBATING HERE IS. TO MAKE IT BETTER FOR THE STUDENTS THAT ARE THERE. FOR TO HELP STUDENTS WHO AREN'T THERE. GET IN TO THE UC SELF. IT'S A POLICY CHOICE AND WHY WOULD WE CHOOSE THAT OVER THE OTHER. LET ME MAKE TRIED TO BREAK THIS INTO TWO PARTS OF THE LIQUID A LAWSUIT. OF THE PAYMENTS WILL BE COMPLETED AS I STATED PREVIOUSLY IN FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THE REGIONS. OF WORK GOING TO VOTE IN JANUARY BUT DELAYED UNTIL MAY THEIR VOTE TO MAKE THAT SURCHARGE PERMANENT AND USE IT VOTER I SAID GET THAT IDEA. SO THAT'S THAT SEPARATE ISSUE WOULDN'T ASIAN TURN THE TERMINATION PARTY ISSUE FOR THAT YOU'RE REQUESTING US. FLAT OUT NINE MILLION DOLLARS TO TO HELP. ADD A PAYMENT IN THE BUDGET. TO GO CAMPUS WIDE TO TO HELP YOU KNOW THE UNIVERSITY NOT NECESSARILY TO BACKFILL IT BUT. SCAN ADDITIONAL MONEY SO WHY WOULD WE DO THAT AS OPPOSED TO USE THAT NINE MILLION FOR EXPANSION. REGARDLESS OF THAT THAT THAT THE LOOK THE REGENTS DECISION ON THE LOS. THE. BIO WILL HELP THE CURRENT STUDENTS NOT MAKE IT PERMANENT ESTA REGIONS HAVE PROPOSED AS THEY'RE CONSIDERING TO DOING IN DOING MAY. ALSO FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN INVOLVEMENT WE HAVE ALREADY CONCLUDED OUR ADMISSION PROCESS SO BE QUITE DIFFICULT AND THEN THE MONEY THAT WOULD GO FOR NINETEEN TWENTY OH FOR NINETEEN TWENTY DUMB. WE ALWAYS GO TEARS AHEAD HERE RIGHT. AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR FORWARD LOOKING. STANCE ON THIS AS IT IS MUCH EASIER FOR THE UNIVERSITY. TO RECEIVE A SIGNAL FROM THE LEGISLATURE ON ROMAN BEFORE WE ACTUALLY ADMIT STUDENTS. WE WERE PLANNING ON USING THAT THOSE FUNDS FOR HIRING THE FACULTY. AND IF WE WERE TO ADMIT MORE STUDENTS WE WOULD NEED FACULTY FOR THEM SO I SUPPOSE THIS IS ONE POSSIBLE FUNDING SOURCE FOR THAT. OKAY BELOW REVISIT THAT. IN. THE OTHER THE OTHER QUESTION IS IS THAT WOULD CERTAINLY. WE ARE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE LAST FEW YEARS THE FUNDS THAT YOU COULD MUM MORE MONEY ON THE TABLE UC'S RESPONDED. ENROLLING MORE QUALIFIED CALIFORNIA KIDS AT THE SAME TIME AND WE'VE CAP THE OUT OF STATE. A NUMBER SO GREAT NEWS FOR CALIFORNIA FAMILIES TRYING TO GET IN THE UC. AND UC HAS GONE ABOVE AND BEYOND AND KIND OF. YEAH รณ OVER AND OVER AND ROLLED OVER IT. ADMITTED ENROLLED WITH THAT THE TAKE RATE IS IS HIRED THEN WAS AND ANTICIPATED. AND SO THAT'S A KIND OF A GOOD PROBLEM BUT I CUT COMING BACK INTO AND ASKING FOR MORE RESOURCES. SO THE CSU DOES NOT DO THAT RIGHT DAY THEY OVER AND ROLLED HERE AND THERE AND THEY HAVEN'T GONE BACK. AND ASKED FOR KIND OF. YOU KNOW BACK MONEY SO BOT WHO WHAT'S THE RATIONALE. WHY? YOU. ARE REQUESTING THAT. Y. CATCH YOU ABSORB IT THROUGH. THE OVERALL THAT YOU SEE BUDGET AND WE COLD AGAIN USE THE RESOURCES THAT YOU'RE ASKING TO TO GO BACK TO CONTINUE TO GROW FOR NINETEEN TWENTY. THE QUALITY ON THE CAMPUSES IS SUFFERING AND OUR CORE FUNDS ARE ALREADY. FULLY UTILIZE TO PROVIDE SERVICES ON THE CAMPUSES IN THE PAPER INSTRUCTORS. A WE HAVE TAKEN AGGRESSIVE STEPS BEHIND THE SCENES TO SAVE COST FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE A NEW PROCUREMENT PROCESS WITHIN DO YOU SEE THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE TOOK. SEVERAL YEARS OF PLANNING AND ORGANIZING BUT IS NOW SAVING OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR OUR CAMPUSES. SO THAT'S ONE THING WE'VE DONE TO TRY AND CONTAIN COSTS SO THAT WE WOULDN'T. OVER BURDEN THE CAMPUSES WE'VE ALSO CREATED OUR OWN INTERNAL. INSURANCE PULL SYSTEM. OF WHERE WE INSURE OUR BUILDINGS NOW AND WE HAVE ALSO MOVED OUR WORKERS COMP ON TO THIS AS WELL. UP WHICH OF STAVING OVER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AS A WE'RE TAKING SOME STEPS TO TRY AND SAVE COST SO THAT THE CAMPUSES. WOULD HAVE RESOURCES FREED UP TO TAKE CARE OF THE EXISTING STUDENTS BUT WE ARE FINDING OURSELVES OVER STRETCHED STUDENTS CAN'T GET INTO THEIR MAJORS. AND WE ARE WEEK DESPERATE NEED TO HIRE MORE FACULTY. THE CSU IS REQUESTING MORE FUNDS ABOVE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS MY UNDERSTANDING AS WELL SO I'M NOT CERTAIN WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING TO USE THOSE FUNDS FOR WE WANNA MAKE CERTAIN THAT QUALITY AT UC DOES NOT FALL. WE. CONTINUE TO ENROLL STUDENTS THROUGH THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. DO TWENTY ELEVEN EVEN THOUGH WE WERE LOSING STATE FUNDS AT THE SAME TIME. SO THE CSU. NOV SCALED BACK THEIR ENROLLMENT AT THAT TIME SO THEY WERE ABLE TO RETAIN SOME OF THE DOLLARS PER STUDENT THAT WE WERE LOSING. SO THAT MIGHT BE ONE ONE REASON WHY THEY. DON'T FEEL THAT THEY NEED THOSE DOLLARS. OKAY MIXTURE. ESTIMATES WHICH I THINK IT. I UP. THANK EACH I WAS CHAIR AYE INTENDED TO BRING THIS UP EARLIER ON. BUT THEM. THERE THERE'S BEEN SOME. ARTICLES RECENTLY THE. HIGHLIGHTING THE CONCERNED ABOUT. IN THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIANS AUGUST. DEPARTMENTS. SLIPPING IN THE WORLD WIDE RANKINGS THE AND AND AND IN TERMS OF A. THE OVERALL QUALITY OF OF OF THE DEPARTMENTS. IS IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT. THAT. IN TERMS OF CRITICALLY IN TERMS OF THE RESEARCH BASED RANKINGS. THAT. THE PRIMARY. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IS THE QUALITY OF THE FACULTY. THAT THE UNIVERSE OF CALIFORNIA'S ATTRACTING RETAINING. IN REGARDS TO THOSE RANKINGS. I THINK YOU SIR OF IT YES THE RESEARCH OF THE FACULTY WHETHER WHERE IT'S PUBLISHED HOW MANY TIMES IT CITED AND WHAT IMPACT IT ENDS UP HAVING ON THE WORLD. UP IMPACTS TO RATINGS OF THE UNIVERSITY AND THE QUALITY. REALLY QUALITY OF EDUCATION IT IMPACTS OF DIFFERENT WITH THE GRADUATE EDUCATION BECAUSE A FACULTY ARE TEACHING THE GRADUATE STUDENTS. HOW TO CONDUCT RESEARCH GIVING THEM EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THEIR LIVES AND ELSEWHERE? TO GAIN THAT RESEARCH EXPERIENCE ABOUT YOU SEE UNDERGRADUATES CAN ALSO WORK IN LABS AND GAIN YOU VERY UNIQUE EXPERIENCE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE. IN OTHER UNIVERSITY SETTINGS UP WE ARE CONCERNED THAT ONCE. ONCE RANKINGS BEGINS TO SLIP ONCE WE LOSE THOSE HIGHLY QUALIFIED FACULTY TO OTHER UNIVERSITIES THAT ARE. EVEN NOW PAYING MORE THAN WE ARE AND THAT MAY HAVE FAR LOWER COST OF LIVING. IT'S VERY HARD TO REGAIN. THAT HIGH STATUS TO REESTABLISH DOT QUALITY. BECOMES MORE MORE EXPENSIVE SO WE WE ARE RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION. FOR A. CONTINUING TO KEEP CLASS SIZES FROM INCREASING SO THE FACULTY. DON'T HAVE TO TEACH IT'S VERY HIGH OF LARGE CLASSES SO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE MORE TIME. AWAY FROM GRADING AND SO FORTH TO DEVOTE THE RESEARCH. OKAY. YOU KNOW THE MORE QUESTIONS I DID WANT TO NOTE THAT IT'S NOT A JAN DIES BUT TEN. I DID ATTEND A LOCAL EVENT LAST WEEK WITH UC DAVIS. WORKING TILL I'M ANNOUNCING THEY'RE GOING TO EXPAND THEIR PRESENCE IN SACRAMENTO ESSENTIALLY A SATELLITE CAMPUS THEY'VE ALREADY HAVE THEIR. NURSING PROGRAM IN THEIR AND THEIR MEDICAL PROGRAM HERE DAVIS AND NOT HAVE TO. NOT THE SECOND ON THE DAVIS CAMPUS. AND DOT JUST THINK THAT THIS IS A YOU KNOW GREAT OPPORTUNITY HERE BUT ALSO THROUGHOUT THE UC. THE MORE WE CAN. DO IN THE SATELLITE LOCATIONS COURSE. I FREEZE UP SPACE AT THE MAIN CAMPUS I'M ROLE MORE CALIFORNIA'S PROVIDING MORE. MONEY EXISTS FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH SO THAT SOMETHING THAT. WE'RE REALLY LOOKING INTO LOOKING TO EMBRACE THE IDEA UC DAVIS OUTPUT FOR BUT ALSO. LOOKING GUY YOU SEE WHITES I THINK THERE'S THESE ARE. WIN WIN OPPORTUNITIES FOR. THE SATELLITE CAMPUS AREA PLUS THE FLAGSHIP CAMPUS. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU. LET'S MOVE ON NOW TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE. OFTEN WITH SOME GENERAL CONTACTS AND THEN DESCRIBE TO ISSUES RELATED TO THE. I AND TWENTY SIXTEEN THE VOTERS PASSED PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX WHICH INCREASED EXCISE TAX RATE ON CIGARETTES TOBACCO PRODUCTS EFFECTIVE ABLE FIRST OF LAST YEAR. THE EXCISE TAX INCREASE BY TWO DOLLARS PER PACK TWENTY CIGARETTES. WITH AN EQUIVALENT EXCISE TAX ON CIGARS BICU CIGARETTES AND OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS. REVENUE FROM THIS INITIATIVE FIRST BACK FEELS PROP NINETY NINE PROPOSITION TEN THE BREAST CANCER FUND AND STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ADDRESS REVENUE TO CLIENTS THAT RESULT FROM THE ADDITIONAL TAX. AFTER THIS BACK FOR LIQUOR SPEAKS DELEGATIONS ARE TAKEN OUT FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION STATE DENTAL PROGRAM ENFORCEMENT ACROSS MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS. OF THE REMAINING REVENUE EIGHTY TWO PERCENT IS PROVIDED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH HILLS HEALTH CARE SERVICES. YOU FUNDED MEDICAL PROGRAM GROWTH AND HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THIRTEEN PERCENT IS PROVIDED FOR TO TOBACCO CONTROL AND PREVENTION PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE REMAINING FIVE PERCENT IS PROVIDED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH. TO CANCER HEART AND LUNG TOBACCO RELATED DISEASES. ON NOW TALK ABOUT THE TO YOU SEE RELATED PROPOSALS. OUT FIRST THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REFLECTS FIFTY SEVEN MILLION TO SUPPORT THE CIGARETTE AND TOBACCO PRODUCTS RESEARCH PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM FUNDS CANCER RESEARCH AS WELL STUDIES OF HEART LUNG DISEASES RELATED TO TOBACCO CONSUMPTION. SECOND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO REFLECTS FORTY MILLION FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION IF THE UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA. THESE FUNDS WILL SUPPORT RESIDENTS DEVELOPING THEIR SKILLS IN FAMILY MEDICINE INTERNAL MEDICINE OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY PEDIATRICS AND EMERGENCY MEDICINE. CONSISTENT WITH THE LANGUAGE OF THIS INITIATIVE. THESE FUNDS ARE CITIES TO SUSTAIN RETAIN AND EXPAND ITS PROGRAMS. AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES THE BUDGET AX RELATED GENERAL ADJUSTMENT AND JONATHAN APPROPRIATIONS TO THE SEA INSTEAD USING A PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDS TO OPERATE THESE PROGRAMS. UC DOES NOT ACCOUNT SPECIFICALLY FOR THE COST OF ENROLLING MEDICAL RESIDENTS I TO UNDERSTAND AYE WHETHER THE SHIFT WOULD HAVE FISCAL IMPACTS WE USED A YOU SEE THAT OLOGY. THAT USED OTHER CONTACTS AND WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THIS SHIFT WILL NOT HAVE PROGRAMMATIC IMPACTS ON THE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. THINKING. ELIOT SO THIS. ISSUE RELATES TO AN IMPLEMENTATION DECISION MADE LAST YEAR BY THE STATE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTED IT I JUST WANTED TO ENSURE THAT THE COMMITTEE YOU. I JUST REMIND THE COMMITTEE OF THAT DECISION. AT LAST YEAR THE. STATE PROVIDED THAT YOU SEE RECEIVE THE FIRST. INSTALLMENT OF THE FORTY MILLION FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION FROM PROPOSITION THE SEX. AND ON WHAT THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE DECIDED TO DO WAS TO USE THAT OF FORTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SHIFT A LIKE AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND THAT YOU SEE ESTIMATED IT WAS SPENDING ON. ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION AND AND SHIFT THAT GENERAL FUND INTO. UC'S GENERAL CAMPUS BUDGET AND THAT SHIFT WAS SCORED AS PART OF UC'S BASED INCREASE IN THAT YEAR GENERAL FUND BASED INCREASE. THE EFFECT OF TAT DECISION WAS EFFECTIVELY TO HOLD A RESIDENCY SLOTS FLAT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RATHER THAN CREATE A NEW PROGRAM AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA TO INCREASE RESIDENCIES. SO THAT'S WHAT THIS ISSUE ARE RELATES TO. I THOUGHT IT BE HELPFUL TO JUST WALK THE COMMITTEE THROUGH SOME OF THE OTHER GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION ISSUES IN THE BUDGET. IT IS PART OF A SEPARATE. A DEAL MADE OF A LAST YEAR THE STATE IS PROVIDING A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS. TO THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE PLANNING HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT ON THAT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS GENERALLY GOING TO. HOSPITALS FOR MEDICAL RESIDENCY SLOTS IT'S ON NEXT OF SERVE ON MAKING UP A LOST REVENUES THAT THE HOSPITALS HAD RECEIVED AN AWESOME IS ALSO TO EXPAND RESIDENCY SLOTS AS WELL. OTHERS ALSO IN ADDITION TO THAT IT THIS YEAR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS IN THE PROCESS OF NEGOTIATING. WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO LEVERAGE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS A TO REIMBURSE HOSPITALS FOR THE GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION COSTS. IF THAT DEAL. LET'S GO THROUGH ITS ESTIMATED TO PROVIDE A FEW HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO HOSPITALS FOR TO REIMBURSE THEIR COSTS. AND YOU THINKING THROUGH YOUR DECISIONS FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU CONSIDER ALL THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU HAVE AT YOUR DISPOSAL AND AND THINK ABOUT HOW YOU'D LIKE TO. SORT OF ALLOCATE THAT FUNDING SO FOR EXAMPLE IF IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN PROVIDING MORE FUNDING TO GRAD GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION. ONE NATURAL AREA IS THE SONG BROWN PROGRAM AT THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT THAT'S A PROGRAM THAT ALREADY EXISTS. ON AND SO THE THERE THERE'S SOME ADVANTAGE THERE TO SORT OF TARGET FUNDING TOWARDS THEIR. ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE IS TO PROVIDE MORE GENERAL FUND TO THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA IF THAT'S SOMETHING OF INTEREST TO YOU THAT COULD HAVE I COULD SORT OF. OF OF WAY THAT'S WHAT THAT WAS DECIDED LAST YEAR IF THAT'S YOUR DECISION WE WOULD JUST RECOMMEND THAT YOU GET MORE INFORMATION FROM THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA ON AND HOW TO ALLOCATE THAT FUNDING WOULD BE A NEW PROGRAM. I'M IN SO YOU'D WANT TO GET. YEAH INFORMATION ON AND HOW YOU YOU SEE SPECIFICALLY INTENDS TO SORT OF. ALLOCATE THOSE FUNDS WERE THAT NEW PROGRAM TO BE A STEP. THANK YOU. THANK YOU UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA. I DON'T THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR. IF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TO TAKE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE UC'S BUDGET AND PROVIDE US WITH FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IMPROPER FIFTY SIX FUNDS. THIS IS. THE SAME AS AND CURRENT YEAR. BILLION IN PROFIT THE SIX FUNDS THAT WAS. FIVE QUARTERS WORTH A FUNDING SO WOULD BE FORTY MILLION GOING FORWARD. WHAT MAY HAVE CONFUSED A LOT OF PEOPLE WAS THAT THE? PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX REFERS TO GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION THAT THESE FUNDS WILL BE USED FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION. THE TERM OF ART IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY THAT REFERS ACTUALLY THE MEDICAL RESIDENTS KNOCK MEDICAL STUDENTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WHEN WE LOST THOSE FUNDS THAT CAME OUT OF OUR MEDICAL SCHOOLS FOR THE TRAINING FOR YOUR TRAINING OF DOCTORS. WE ARE SPENDING THE FUNDS FROM PROP FIFTY SIX. ON OUR MEDICAL RESIDENT TRAINING. BUT THE INTENT OF THE PROPOSITION THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO THINK. THAT THE INTENT OF THE PROPOSITION WAS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF MEDICAL RESIDENCY SLOTS IN THE STATE. BECAUSE WE HAVE A INCREASING NEED FOR DOCTORS THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT. DOCTORS AND A PRACTICING WHERE THEY IN THE NEARBY AREA WHERE THEY COMPLETE THEIR MEDICAL RESIDENCY. I'M BY NOT HAVING SUFFICIENT SLOTS IN THE STATE WHERE ACTUALLY LOSING. FOR YOUR MEDICAL. SCHOOL GRADUATES TO OTHER STATES WHERETHEY MANDATE PRACTICING SO. WE LOSE SOME OF THEM THAT WE HAVE FULLY TRAINED. A MEDICAL RESIDENT COST BETWEEN HUNDRED THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ANNUALLY DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY ARE PRACTICING AND TYPE OF MEDICINE THEY PRACTICE. IF THE CLINIC OF STARTING A NEW PROGRAM FOR THEM OR IF THEY ALREADY HAVE EXISTING SLOTS. THIS MEANS THAT. BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY AND FOUR HUNDRED MEDICAL RESIDENCY SLOTS ARE BEING LOST TO THE STATE BY REMOVING FROM YOU SEE HE FUNDS THAT. USED TO PAY FOR UC MEDICAL RESIDENCY TRAINING AND FORCING YOU SEE TO USE FIFTH PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDS. FOR THAT TRAINING CURRENTLY. SO WE ARE REQUESTING THAT THE. US SWAP BEYOND DAWN AND YOU SEE BE ABLE TO. USE THE PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDS TO DISTRIBUTE STATE. FOR A MEDICAL. A. HOSPITALS AND OTHER PROGRAMS THAT HAVE. RESIDENCY PROGRAMS WE'RE PROPOSING TO DEVELOP A NONPROFIT BOARD COMPOSED OF FIFTEEN. THE FIFTEEN SEATS. DOUBLE BE HELD BY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PROMINENT IN CALIFORNIA MEDICAL COMMUNITY PLEASE INCLUDE THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. A NETWORK OF ETHNIC PHYSICIANS SCEI YOU CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL AND OTHERS. AND YOU SEE WOULD OF COURSE HAVE A SEAT ON THIS BOARD. BECAUSE YOU SEE WILL BE AUDITED PARTY USE OF THESE FUNDS WE WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THEY. GRANT DISTRIBUTIONS EITHER CONDUCTED BY UC OR A NONPROFIT WHERE YOU SEE HOLDS UP A SEAT OR THE CHAIR POSITION. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO UP. ANSWER FOR HOW THOSE FUNDS WERE SPENT BUT WE. IF YOU SEE IS MADE WHOLE WE WILL DISTRIBUTE THESE FUNDS IN A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL BASES AROUND THE STATE. FOR MEDICAL RESIDENCY SLOTS AROUND HOSPITALS AND COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU I I KNOW THIS ISN'T AN ISSUE THAT. HAS BROUGHT A LOT OF OF ATTENTION AND. YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT TO THE ADVOCATES WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM AND TO. SOME OF US HERE FOR THE DICE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. THAT THE MEASURE WAS PASSED BEFORE THE VOTERS. AND WE'RE HAVING BAD RECORD AMOUNTS COMMAND THE BUDGET LAST TWO YEARS AND WERE MAKING THIS. YOU'RE TAKING THIS ACTION YOU KNOW THIS AN ACTION YOU WOULD TAKE DURING THAT RECESSION WE'RE SLASHING MONEY. S. DOESN'T. LOGICALLY MAKE SENSE DURING THIS THIS ISSUE SO I WILL CONTINUE TO ADD TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT. YOUR THE MAY REVISE MAYBE THE GOVERNMENT WILL COME BACK WITH A DIFFERENT PROPOSAL DURING THE MAY REVISION. STIR MEDINA. AYE I THINK THAT IT THIS IS AN ISSUE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO YOU SEE. RIVERSIDE THAT HAS A NEW MEDICAL SCHOOL AND I KNOW THAT THERE IS A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TIME. FOR A. MEDICAL SCHOOL TO ESTABLISH THE NUMBER OF RESIDENCIES THAT THERE'S ONLY A SMALL WINDOW A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY. TO. GET THE NUMBER ESTABLISH OF RESIDENTS AND AS YOU STATED. TO AN AREA LIKE THE INLAND EMPIRE A IT IS CRUCIAL THAT WE HAVE THE RESIDENTS. AFTER THEY FINISH. MEDICAL SCHOOL AT UC RIVERSIDE IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THEM PRACTICE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. GIVE LE OUR GRADUATES OF THE MEDICAL SCHOOL WHICH WE HAD THE FIRST CLASS. OF APPROXIMATELY FIFTY LAST YEAR HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE THE AREA TO DO THE RESIDENCY. OTHERS A GOOD CHANCE THAT THEY WILL NOT STAY IN OUR AREA TO PRACTICE MEDICINE SO THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. A TO THE INLAND EMPIRE AND I ECHO THAT THE CHAIRS A. SENTIMENT THAT WE DO NOT DO WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING THAT BUT THAT WE KEEP YOU SEE HOLE. THINK I. THANK YOU AND I WILL HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC CAN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS. I AM SEEING NO. FURTHER COMMENTERS CASH IN ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT BY OKAY PLEASE PROCEED. HI GOOD MORNING IT CHAIRMEN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND KAREN FLARED AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF STATE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AT THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. IF I MAY INTERRUPT FOR JUST ONE MOMENT AND SEE IF THE US SERGEANT COULD ALSO. PASS OUT A COPY FOR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OF WHAT'S JUST BEEN DISTRIBUTED. I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH THANK YOU. AYE SO I WANT TO START TODAY BY THANKING YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND ALSO. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND SUPPORT OF UC'S BUDGING REQUEST BUDGET REQUEST FOR THIS YEAR MUCH APPRECIATED. I AS I MENTIONED I'M KAREN FLIRTY AND THE DIRECTOR OF STATE GOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS AT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT TODAY I HAVE WITH ME DAVE FALL TAX WHO'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR IN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. BUDGET AND FINANCE DAVIS RELATIVELY NEW TO YOU SEE. JUST A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AND HE IS RESPONSIBLE IN LARGE PART FOR MANY OF THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE MADE IN OUR BUDGETING. AT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT THING AND START BY GIVING SOME VERY BRIEF CONTEXT ON THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. WHAT IT DOES HOW IT IS FUNDED AND AND FOR PURPOSES OF THIS ITEM IT'S IMPORTANT TO DISCUSS HOW THE YOU CO P. BUDGET WAS FUNDED BEFORE? AND THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE BY THE LEGISLATURE AND AND THE GOVERNOR IN THE STATE BUDGET ACTIVE TWENTY SEVENTEEN. JUST AS AREFRESHER AS YOU KNOW I YOU SEE IS COMPRISED OF TEN CAMPUSES FIVE ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS AND WE'RE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF THREE NATIONAL LABORATORY SO IF YOU TURN TO SLIDE TO. OF THAT JACK THAT WAS DISTRIBUTED I JUST WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION THAT PUTS THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT IN CONTEXT. I YOU SEE EMPLOYEES OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SITE YOUR PAGE TO. I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT PAGE TO PAGE TWO. I YOU SEE EMPLOYEES OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND FULL TIME EQUIVALENT EMPLOYEES. THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT EMPLOYS APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED OF THIS ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND OP FULL TIME EQUIVALENT EMPLOYEES OR ABOUT ONE PERCENT. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S TOTAL BUDGET FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS PROJECTED TO BE ABOUT THIRTY FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION. YOU SEE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT TOTAL BILL TOTAL BUDGET IS PROJECTED JUST UNDER EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION. SO THAT'S ABOUT TWO POINT THREE PERCENT OF UC'S TOTAL BUDGET. HOWEVER. LESS THAN HALF OF THE U. CEO P. BUDGET OF EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION. IS STATE GENERAL FUND SO THE STATE GENERAL FUND PIECE OF THE U. CO P. TOTAL BUDGET IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ARE AGAIN THAT'S ABOUT ONE PERCENT. OF UC'S TOTAL. SO IF WE TURN NOW TO PAGE THREE. AYE QUICKLY TO ADDRESS. WHAT IT IS THAT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT DOES OUR FUNCTIONS? IN THE BIG PICTURE WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING ACTIVITIES THAT FURTHER UC'S PUBLIC SERVICE ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH MISSIONS. OUR BEHALF OF STUDENTS FACULTY STAFF. PATIENTS AND THE BROADER PUBLIC DO THIS THROUGH TWO VERY IMPORTANT INDISTINCT FUNCTION ONE IS THE CENTRALIZED AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES. THESE ARE THINGS LIKE THE SYSTEM WIDE ADMISSIONS PORTAL STUDENT SERVICES AND FINANCIAL AID. I RETIREMENT BENEFITS ACADEMIC PERSONNEL AND LABOR. I MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES INVESTMENT OF A. MANAGEMENT OF A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR. INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. GRANTS MANAGEMENT BUDGETING FINANCE CAPITAL STRATEGIES AND RISK MANAGEMENT. LEGAL COMPLIANCE AUDIT TITLE NINE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS PUBLIC AFFAIRS ENERGY AND SUSTAINABILITY. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY HEALTH AND SOME OTHERS. THIS PORTION OF THE BUDGET THE CENTRAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES PORTION ALSO HAS SOME SUPPORT FOR THE ACADEMIC SENATE. AND FOR THE BOARD OF REGENTS. THE OTHER. COMPONENT IS THE. SIXTY SYSTEM SIXTY SYSTEM WIDE ACADEMIC AND PUBLIC SERVICE PROGRAMS IN THE ACADEMIC AND PUBLIC SERVICE PROGRAM SECTION OF THE BUDGET. I THESE ARE CARRIED OUT DIVISIONS LIKE ACADEMIC AFFAIRS WHERE THINGS LIKE ACADEMIC PREPARATION AND OUTREACH PROGRAMS WITH LIVE. AYE YOU SEE HEALTH I IN A DIVISION CALLED AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES THAT IS SYSTEM WIDE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AS WELL AS. THE NATIONAL LABORATORIES SO I UNLESS THERE'S SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ON THAT I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE. OVERALL BUDGET FOR THAT FIRST COMPONENT IS THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT POINT SEVEN MILLION. THAT WOULD BE THE CENTRAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES AND AS I MENTIONED ONLY A PORTION OF THAT IS STATE GENERAL FUND. THE SECOND COMPONENT THE SYSTEMWIDE ACADEMIC AND PUBLIC SERVICE BUDGET IS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION. AND AS I MENTIONED ONLY A PORTION OF THAT IS STATE GENERAL FUND SAID THESE NUMBERS ARE GONNA BE AVAILABLE ON A SUBSEQUENT SLIDE FOR YOU SO YOU DON'T NEED TO JOT THOSE DOWN. AND MISTER BALL TAXES GONNA BREAK IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT FURTHER ON IT IS CHALLENGING WHEN LOOKING AT A UC SYSTEM WIDE OFFICE TO COMPARE IT TO OTHER HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS. BECAUSE. ALL HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS VARY A LOT AND SCALE AND SCOPE THE UNIVERSITY HAS A VERY BROAD SCOPE BECAUSE WE DO THE ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER COMPONENT IN THE LABS THE AGRICULTURE NATURAL RESOURCES. AND WE ALSO HAVE A VERY BROAD SCALE BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND WE EMPLOY A LOT OF PEOPLE AND WE HAVE A LOT OF STUDENTS SO. NONE THE LESS WE DID I HAVE A CONSULTANT TAKE A LOOK AT THIS SO THAT WE CAN GET A BETTER IDEA. AYE AS PART OF AN EFFORT TO YOU OPTIMALLY ORGANIZE THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT TO TRY AND BE. AYE RIGHT SIZED RIGHT FOCUSED AND AND PROVIDE THE RIGHT SERVICES AND WHAT WE DISCOVERED BY COMPARING US TO TEN OTHER HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS. THIS CONSULTANT ACTUALLY INDEPENDENTLY. DETERMINED. THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THE AMOUNT OF EMPLOYEES THAT WE HAVE AND THE AMOUNT OF SPEND THAT WE HAVE. WE'RE JUST IN THAT IN THE BOTTOM HALF OF WHOM WE COMPARED OURSELVES TO SO THE COMPARISON INSTITUTIONS INCLUDED. PUBLIC RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE UNIVERSITY BUT ALSO COMPREHENSIVE FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEMS ALL OF WHOM HAVE A SYSTEM WIDE CENTRAL OFFICE. BUT THEY VERY VERY MUCH IN FUNCTION AND SO WE TRIED TO GET A BETTER IDEA TO PROVIDE A COMPARISON. I WITH RESPECT TO THAT. IF WE WERE TO RETURN AYE FOR TO RETURN TO THE SLIDES NOW AND PAGE FOR. I JUST WANT TO DISCUSS SOME. IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE OUGHT TO UC'S FUNDING MODEL IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS ARE BACK IN TWENTY ELEVEN TWELVE YOU SEE ADOPTED IN NEW FUNDING MODEL THAT WAS INTENDED TO ALLOCATE STATE GENERAL FUNDS. THAT. THE STATE PROVIDES TO YOU SEE AS ONE MAIN ST GENERAL FUND SUPPORT APPROPRIATION FOR THE UNIVERSITY. I THIS WAS CALLED THE FUNDING STREAMS MODEL WE'VE NOW RE FIND IT IN COLLEGE RE BENCHING IT'S BASED ON THREE PRINCIPLES THAT ARE AND THE BULLETS THERE AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE. FIRST IS THAT REVENUES GENERATED BY A CAMPUS GENERALLY ARE RETAINED BY THE CAMPUS OF THIS WOULD BE TO ASH AND FRANCE STANCE. I STUDENTS AT EVERY CAMPUS ARE ENTITLED TO THE SAME LEVEL OF STATE GENERAL FUND SUPPORT. SET PRINCIPLE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO THE LEGISLATURE IN AND WE SHARE THAT PRINCIPLE. AND FINALLY THAT YOU CO P. WILL PROVIDE CERTAIN CENTRAL SERVICES AND SYSTEM WIDE PROGRAMMING THAT CAMPUSES PAY A FAIR SHARE OUGHT TO RECIEVE. IN THE NEXT PORTION YOU SEE MORE ABOUT THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS FOR YOU CO P. SERVICES THAT I JUST MENTIONED. I THEY WERE NEGOTIATED AND LARGELY FORMULA BASED AND SIMILAR TO THAT FEE FOR SERVICES MODEL THAT CAMPUSES WOULD PAY TO THE CENTRAL OFFICE AS AN ANNUAL ASSESSMENT. I'M IN IT WAS BASED LARGELY ON THE AMOUNT OF EMPLOYEES THE AMOUNT OF AYE SPANS AYE AND SOME OTHER FACTORS THAT WERE WERE FORMULA BASED TO TRY AND DETERMINE WHAT WOULD BE A REASONABLE ASSESSMENT TO PAY FOR THE CENTRAL SERVICES. THE STATE HOWEVER WANTED TO CHANGE THIS MODEL AND IN THE BUDGET ACTIVE TWENTY SEVENTEEN I THEY DID TAKE ACTION. AND WHAT HAPPENED BASICALLY IS AYE THE STATE REPLACED THE STATE GENERAL FUND SUPPORT ALLOCATION FOR THE UNIVERSITY. WITH THREE STATE GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATIONS ONE IS THE MAIN YOU SEE SUPPORT APPROPRIATION WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING AYE THERE'S ANOTHER ONE FOR YOU SEE PATH WHICH IS THE NEXT ITEM AFTER US HERE. AND ONE FOR YOU SEE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AYE CERTAIN FUNCTIONS OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING IN THIS ITEM. AND SO I'M. UC'S ONE GENERAL FUND SPORT ALLOCATION THEN BECAME THREE AND WHAT THE STATUS IT ELIMINATED THE CAMPUSES HAVING TO PAY AN ASSESSMENT. BUT IT ALSO REDUCED BY THE AMOUNT THAT CAMPUSES WOULD RECIEVE THROUGH THAT MAIN APPROPRIATION BY AN EQUAL AMOUNT SO IT IT BALANCED OUT IT WAS BASICALLY I ONE FOR ONE. I'M YOU SEE DID OPPOSE THIS CHANGE AT THE TIME AND IT WAS DECIDED IN CONFERENCE COMMITTEE TO MOVE FORWARD OUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRIOR SYSTEM WHERE CAMPUS CONTRIBUTE. BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT I MADE SENSE AND WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE IT'S A FEE FOR SERVICES STYLE MODEL WHERE THE CAMPUSES CAN DETERMINE IN CONJUNCTION WITH YOU SEE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. WHAT THEY WANT TO HAVE PERFORMED AS A CENTRAL SERVICE AND WHAT THEY DON'T WANT TO PURCHASE AND SORT OF INPUT INTO HOW MUCH THEY'RE WILLING TO TO PROVIDE FOR THOSE SERVICES? I'M YOU KNOW GOING BACK TO THAT CAMPUS CONTRIBUTION AS ASSESSMENT AYE WE THINK WOULD RESTORE INAPPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AT CAMPUSES RESPONSIBILITY FOR FUNDING. YOU CO P. AND THE CAMPUS ITSELF AND BY THAT I MEAN. THAT SOME OF THE CAMPUSES ARE LARGER AND HAVE ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS FOR INSTANCE AND HAVE MORE EMPLOYEES AND MORE STUDENTS. SO THE ASSESSMENT THAT THEY WERE PAYING WAS LARGER AYE NOW THEY DON'T PAY THAT ASSESSMENT AND SAID THEY'RE SORT OF DISPROPORTIONATELY BENEFITING FROM NOT HAVING TO PAY THAT ASSESSMENT. WHERE SOME OF THE SMALLER CAMPUSES THAT DON'T HAVE AN ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN OUR VIEW? UNFAIRLY PUNISHED SO WHAT WE HAD TO DO WAS WE HAD TO CHANGE SOME INTERNAL ACCOUNTING PRACTICES. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CAMPUS IS WERE HELD HARMLESS IN THIS NEW MODEL SO THAT THERE WASN'T. YOU KNOW THERE WASN'T SOME SORT OF A DISPROPORTIONATE BENEFIT BY NOT HAVING TO PAY THIS ASSESSMENT. THAT WOULD GO DOES SOME OF THE LARGER BETTER RESOURCE TO CAMPUSES SO ON THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE FEEL IS. NOT NECESSARY IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW AND IT'S LESS TRANSPARENT IN SOME WAY SO I'M WE WOULD LIKE TO RETURN TO THE PRIOR ASSESSMENT. IT'S BEEN INDICATED THAT. BY THE BY THE CHAIRMAN I BELIEVE AND I DON'T MEAN TO PUT WORDS IN HIS MOUTH THAT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING. THAT I HE WANTED TO FAVOR THIS YEAR AYE BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE DID I REQUEST. THROUGH BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND. THEY DID NOT PUT THAT INTO THE JANUARY INTRODUCTIONS TO THE WAY THINGS ARE NOW ARE WITH A DIRECT LINE ITEM APPROPRIATION FOR THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. A DIRECT LINE ITEM APPROPRIATION FOR YOU SEE PATH AND THAT OUR MAIN SUPPORT APPROPRIATION. SO I MOVING ON FROM THAT TO SLIDE FIVE PER PAGE FIVE I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON. A FEW RECENT CHANGES THAT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT THAT IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY AND BEST PRACTICES. THE OUT IT YOU'RE QUITE FAMILIAR pWITH. APRIL TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR MADE THIRTY THREE RECOMMENDATIONS WE ARE IMPLEMENTING ALL THIRTY THREE RECOMMENDATIONS TO IT TEN. ARE DUE ON APRIL TWENTY FIFTH THE BALANCE ARE DUE IN APRIL OF TWENTY NINETEEN IN APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY. AYE IN ADDITION WE ARE DOING THIS ORGANIZATIONAL OPTIMIZATION TO ANSWER RARE RIGHT ORGANIZED RIGHT SIZED AND RIGHT SERVICES AN EXAMPLE OF THAT THAT WE'VE ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED JUST RECENTLY AND ACTUALLY IT STARTS ON ME ONE. SWEET MERGED TWO DIVISIONSAT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT WHICH ELIMINATES ONE OF OUR SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT POSITIONS SO GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS ARE GOING TO BE BROUGHT TOGETHER IN ONE DEBATE AND. AND WHAT THAT DOES IS THAT MEANS THAT. THERE'S NO NEED FOR TWO SENIOR VICE PRESIDENTS FOR ONE DIVISION SO I ONE OF THOSE POSITIONS WILL BE ELIMINATED THAT IS JUST AN EXAMPLE THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG TERM PROCESS TO TRY AND I REORGANIZED IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE. WE DON'T WANT TO BE JUST MOVING DECK CHAIRS AROUND. ON THE THERESE SHIP WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THESE SORTS OF THINGS MAKE SENSE THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT MADE SENSE AND SO WE TOOK THAT ACTION. I YOU'LL HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE EXECUTIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE SO I WON'T GO INTO THAT BUT THAT'S A WAY OF GETTING STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT FROM THE CAMPUSES AT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. AND THEN THERE'S ALSO A REPORT THAT'S PRETTY AYE PENDING OFF FROM AN OUTSIDE FIRM SCHOENBERG AB SHANK AND THIS IS RELATING TO ASSESSING AT CERTAIN SERVICES COULD BE DUPLICATIVE. BETWEEN THE CAMPUS IS PROVIDING THEM AND THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT PROVIDING THEM AND THAT REPORT IS DUE LATER THIS MONTH AS YOUR AGENDA INDICATES SO. AT THIS POINT I THINK IT'S I MAKE SENSE TO TURN IT OVER TO DAVE PAUL TAX WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT BUDGET AND FINANCE. AND DAVE IS GOING TO WALK YOU THROUGH THE ACTUAL. BUDGET A LITTLE BIT. THANK YOU KAREN AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBERS. SO I'LL START ON. PAGE SIX SHOWING THE UC OP BUDGET. WHICH AS DESCRIBED JUST EARLIER ADDRESSES THE CENTRAL ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES. AND SYSTEM WIDE ACADEMIC AND PUBLIC SERVICE FUNCTIONS OF THE UNIVERSITY. THE FIGURE SHOWN ARE FROM THE YOU SEE A P. BUDGET FOR FISCAL TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. WHICH THE UC REGENTS APPROVED IN JULY OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THE CENTRAL ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES PORTION OF THE CO OP BUDGET TOTALS THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX POINT TWO MILLION. OR ABOUT FORTY TWO PERCENT OF THE TOTAL SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET. THESE COSTS INCLUDE ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT FUNCTIONS OR CENTRALIZED OPERATIONAL SERVICES. WHICH ARE PERFORMED MORE EFFICIENTLY BY HAVING ONE ENTITY PERFORM THEM ON BEHALF OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. KEY ACT HERE IN MENTIONED SEVERAL OF THEM BUT A FEW EXAMPLES. FROM DIVISIONS AND FUNCTIONS ARE ACADEMIC AFFAIRS MANAGEMENT OF THE APPLY YOU SEE APPLICATION PROCESS. OUR INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP. DIVISION WHICH MANAGES PATENT ADMINISTRATION CENTRALLY. AND PASSES THROUGH ABOUT FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF ROYALTIES OUGHT TO THE CAMPUSES. AND OUR OFFICE OF CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER WHICH CENTRALLY MANAGES UC PORTFOLIO. UP PORTFOLIOS OF INVESTED INVESTMENTS. I SYSTEMWIDE ACADEMIC AND PUBLIC SERVICES PROGRAMS TOTAL FOUR HUNDRED EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS INCLUDING ONE HUNDRED AND TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS. FOUR DIVISION AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES. OVER HALF OF THE TOTAL YOU CO P. BUDGET SUPPORTS STATEWIDE AND SYSTEM WIDE ACADEMIC AND PUBLIC SERVICE PROGRAMS. THESE INCLUDE SUPPORT FOR INSTRUCTION INCLUDING ARE YOU SEE WASHINGTON PROGRAM RESEARCH SUCH AS THE TOBACCO RELATED DISEASE IN BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND PUBLIC SERVICE PROGRAMS. I'M AND ACADEMIC SUPPORT. LIKE YOU SEE PRESS. FOR FISCAL TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE UC OP BUDGET IS SUPPORTED BY STATE GENERAL FUNDS WHICH WERE DIRECTLY APPROPRIATED. TWO HUNDRED NINETY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR YOU CO P.. PLUS FIFTY TWO POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE UC PASSED CENTER. FOR YOU SEE OUR P. THIS FUNDING REPLACE THE CAMPUS ASSESSMENT OF THE PRIOR YEAR. WHICH WAS THREE HUNDRED AND TWELVE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. THE BALANCE OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN. POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS COMES FROM INVESTMENT INCOME AND RESTRICTED OR DESIGNATED SOURCES SUCH AS RESEARCH GRANTS. NATIONAL LABS INVESTMENT RETIREMENT ADMINISTRATION PATENT ROYALTIES AND AND SO FORTH. SO. MOVING ON A LINE ADVANCE NOW TO SLIDE SEVEN. FOR THAT NOT COMING YEAR FISCAL TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. WE'RE WORKING ON A NUMBER OF BUDGET IMPROVEMENTS. FIRST. YOU CEO PAY IS DEVELOPING ONE CONSOLIDATED YOU SEE OP BUDGET THAT ELIMINATES THE USE OF ONE TIME OR TEMPORARY BUDGETS. NEXT WE'RE IMPLEMENTING THE CSA RECOMMENDED BUDGET PRESENTATION. WHICH INCLUDE SEVERAL ENHANCEMENTS. THE BUDGET WILL BE MORE TRANSPARENT. TO BETTER SHOW HOW YOU SEE A PIECE BUDGET SUPPORTS THE UNIVERSITY MISSION ACROSS TEACHING RESEARCH AND PUBLIC SERVICE. THIS INCLUDES OUR COMPLETION OF CLEAR DEFINITIONS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES FEE FOR SERVICE AND PASS THROUGHS. THESE DEFINITIONS WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP THE BUDGET. YOU CO P. HAS INCREASED THE ANALYTICS USE TO DEVELOP THE BUDGET INCLUDING. DEVELOPMENT OF FINANCIAL FORECASTS TO COMPARE PROJECTED ACTUAL EXPENSES TO THE SUBSEQUENT YEARS BUDGET. INCREASED REVIEW INVARIANCE ANALYSIS ON ACTUAL COSTS. WHICH CAN BE USED TO IMPROVE TARGETS AND THE ACCURACY OF THE ANNUAL BUDGET. AND ADDING NEW BUDGET METHODOLOGIES INCLUDING ZERO BASED BUDGETING IN AREAS SUCH AS TRAVEL MEETINGS OUTSIDE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. AND TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES. YOU SEE APPEARS ADDING REVENUE BUDGETS THIS YEAR WHICH CAN BE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF YOU SEE A P. FUND SOURCES. AND HOW THEY'RE APPLIED TO SUPPORT THE OVERALL BUDGET. THE FY TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET ALSO INTRODUCED A PHASED APPROACH INTENDED TO ENABLE MORE INPUT FROM OUR DIVISION LEADERS. DISCUSSION SURROUNDING YOU SEE OP RESOURCES PRIORITIES AND TRADE OFF DECISIONS INCLUDED MORE TRANSPARENCY. WIDER AND PUT AND GREATER COLLABORATION. AND I'LL REITERATE. THAT WE RECONVENE THE EXECUTIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE ARM WHICH IS REPRESENTED BY CAMPUS REPRESENTATIVES THE STUDENT. SENATE AND OTHERS. AND WE'VE BEEN MEETING MORE AT LEAST MONTHLY AYE SINCE LAST AUGUST. IN ADDITION YOU SEE APPEARS PLACE GREATER EMPHASIS ON BUDGET PROCESS DESIGN AND DOCUMENTATION. THESE CAN BE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE VALUE IN DEFINING REPEATABLE PROCESS SEES AND ASSURANCES THAT STANDARDS ARE SATISFIED MOVING FORWARD. LASTLY YOU CO P. HAVE BEEN ADDRESSING. OUR EXISTING BUDGET SOFTWARE AND SYSTEM TO MAKE INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS INTENDED TO IMPROVE THE DATA INTEGRITY. AND REPORTING. WHILE WE CONTINUE TO ADVANCE EFFORTS FOR A NEW MORE ROBUST FINANCIAL PLANNING AND REPORTING SYSTEM. SO I'LL MOVE TO SLIDE EIGHT. AND SLIDE EIGHT WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING. FOR THE TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET. I'M THE BUDGET FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. PRESENTS BOTH OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES. AS WITH MOST ORGANIZATIONS THERE ARE TYPICALLY ANNUAL COST INCREASES THE PLACE UPWARD PRESSURE ON COSTS WHICH MUST BE MANAGED. YOU SEE A P. BUDGET FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. EXCLUDING YOU SEE PATH. IT SEEMS THE SAME LEVEL OF STATE GENERAL FUNDS AS FY TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. AT TWO HUNDRED NINETY SIX POINT FOUR MILLION. AS THERE WAS NO THREE PERCENT ADJUSTMENT PROVIDED IN THE JANUARY BUDGET INTRODUCTION FOR YOU CEO PAY. I'LL ADD THAT A THREE PERCENT ADJUSTMENT WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY NINE MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE. AND ALSO NOTE THAT THIS LEVEL OF FUNDING. WOULD NOW BE FLAT. FOR A THIRD CONSECUTIVE YEAR. ROUGHLY AT THE FY TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ASSESSMENT LEVEL. THE CONFUSION AROUND SOME OF THE INCREASE IN THE OP BUDGET I THINK I IS DRIVEN BY THINGS SUCH AS RESEARCH GRANTS AND FUNDS THAT CAN INCREASE THE HARM. FOR PURPOSES OF SOME OF THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS. ETHIOPIA'S PLANNING FOR REDUCE REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH REDIRECTION OF A POINT FIVE MILLION TO BE USED TO SUPPORT AN INCREASE IN UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT. ADDITIONALLY EACH YEAR THERE COST INCREASES AREAS LIKE EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND CONTRACTS WITH OUTSIDE VENDORS. THAT MUST BE MET. I'M WE MENTIONED EARLIER THEY. ESTABLISHMENT OF A STRATEGIC PRIORITY FIND PRACTICE WHICH WAS REVIEWED BY THE UC REGENTS IN JANUARY. AND THAT CALLS FOR THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN PERMANENT BUDGET. SUPPORT STRATEGIC AN URGENT NEEDS. AN EXAMPLE OF. OUR THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS ARE ARE TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF SUPPORT FOR UC RIVERSIDE MEDICAL SCHOOL. IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PRACTICE. WILL REDUCED ETHIOPIAN SPANNED BY APPROXIMATELY HALF FOR THESE PURPOSES. AFTER THE ELIMINATION OF PREVIOUS PRACTICE OF ONE TIME OR TEMPORARY BUDGETS. HOWEVER IT PUTS PRESSURE ON THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET. LASTLY WERE INCORPORATING RESTRUCTURING CHANGES AND INCLUDING THE BUDGET IMPACTS. TO OFFSET THESE UPWARD PRESSURES YOU SEE A P. HAS BEEN UNDERTAKING COST SAVINGS EFFORTS. WHICH INCLUDE TARGETING LOWER TRAVEL EXTERNAL SERVICES IN MEMBERSHIPS. IMPLEMENTING POLICY CHANGES. TRAVEL REIMBURSEMENT STIPENDS STAR AWARDS. REDUCING THE PRESIDENT'S INITIATIVE FIND WHICH WAS BUDGETED PREVIOUSLY AT SEVEN AT NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. BY TWO MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS GOING TOWARD. ENROLLMENT GROWTH. I SUBSEQUENTLY DISCONTINUING THE USE OF ONE TIME TEMPORARY BUDGETS. WE'RE GOING THROUGH AND HAVE GONE THROUGH A THOROUGH REVIEW OF ALL OPEN POSITIONS AND VACANCIES N ADJUSTING THESE ACCORDINGLY TO REDUCE BUDGET VARIANCE. SALARY SAVINGS. AND FINALLY ELIMINATING ANY CONTINGENCIES ARM AS THESE NOW MUST BE COVERED WITHIN THE STRATEGIC PRIORITY FUND. SO. TO KIND OF CLOSE WE ARE. STILL WORKING THROUGH THE BUDGET WE HAVE SOME REVIEWS THAT WE STILL MUST GO THROUGH WITH THE PRESIDENT. AND OF COURSE WE ARE DRIVING TOWARD THE. PRESENTATION OF THE BUDGET TO THE REGENTS. WHICH WILL HAPPEN MAY TWENTY THIRD. SO WITH THAT I'LL AND THERE AND. WE'LL TAKE QUESTIONS. QUESTION ESTHER MEDINA. A QUESTION QUESTION TO MR CLARITY. ON RE BENCHING. SOMETHING THAT IS. IMPORTANT TO AYE I THINK SOME OF THE SMALLER CAMPUSES UC RIVERSIDE UC SANTA BARBARA UC SANTA CRUZ. YOU MENTIONED AND I THINK YOU STATED IN THE BUDGET. THAT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU SEE. DON'T HAVE IN FRONT OF ME THAT ALL STUDENTS I HAVE THE SAME SHARE OF STATE FUNDING. SO HAVE WE CLOSE THAT GAP IS THAT GAP. GONE AND NO LONGER EXISTED WARY STUDENT UCLA IS BEING FUNDED MUCH HIGHER. RATE. THEN A STUDENT AT UC SANTA BARBARA UC RIVERSIDE. THE UC SANTA CRUZ THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR MEDINA AND I. I CAN SAY THAT AT THIS FISCAL YEAR. AYE EITHER MARKS THE FIRST OR THE SECOND AND MS BRITANNIAN CAN. CONFIRM FOR ME WITH THAT THEY RE BENCHING PROCESS HAS BECOME COMPLETE WE ADVANCED IT BY A YEAR. ITS IMPLEMENTATION PLAN BY A YEAR I'M. PREVIOUSLY. WHEN WE'RE GOING THROUGH SOME SOME PRIOR YEAR'S BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS AND AND NOW WE CAN STATE THAT YET STUDENTS AT EVERY CAMPUS ARE ARE RECEIVING THE SAME LEVEL OF STATE GENERAL FUND. SUPPORT ONE CAMPUS TO THE OTHER THAT CONCERN THAT I REYES TODAY IS THAT THERE NEEDED TO BE. I SOME AYE INTERNAL ACCOUNTING THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE. TO ENSURE THAT UNDER THIS NEW MATH ED WHERE THE STATE IS DIRECT LINE ITEM APPROPRIATING THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT BUDGET. THAT THAT THAT DIDN'T HAVE ANY NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE PER STUDENT FUNDING FOR FOR EACH CAMPUS. AYE THERE IS SOME SOME CHANGE IN BUDGETING THAT THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE TO ACCOMMODATE THAT BUT YES IT'S HAPPENING. WELL I I WOULD APPLAUD YOU SEE IN AND GETTING THEIR. I THINK IT WAS VERY. KIND OF A STARK REVELATION TO A LOT OF FOLKS WHEN WHEN THAT CAME UP. SO I I APPLAUD. YOU SEE FOR. MAKING IT MORE EQUAL A ACROSS THE SYSTEM. AND HOPE THAT THAT. FUTURE FUNDING MECHANISMS DON'T DISRUPT THAT. BECAUSE THE. IT SEEMS VERY UNFAIR. THE THE PREVIOUS SYSTEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE THAT. OKAY THANK YOU WE WE HEAR THE. THEIR REQUEST THANKS FOR THE UPDATE AND. WE STILL STAND BY THE ACTION FROM LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. ISSUE NUMBER FIVE YOU SEE PAT OKAY. GO AHEAD. OUR GOOD AFTERNOON OR GOOD GOOD MORNING. MARK SIALKOT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA I'M YOU SO SHE FACE PRESIDENT FOR OPERATIONAL SERVICES. CHOOSE A SYSTEM WIDE ACTIVITY. TODAY WE'RE HERE TO. PROVIDE AN INITIAL BRIEFING ON YOU SEE PATH WE'VE NOT COME TO THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE TO TALK ABOUT YOU SEE PATH. SO IN THE PRESENTATION THAT'S IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY. I'D LIKE TO VERY BRIEFLY INTRODUCE. THE NATURE OF YOU SEE PATH INITIATIVE ARE INTENDED AND STATE. ARE TO PROVIDE YOU CURRENT STATUS AND THEN TO LOOK AT OUR PROPOSED OPERATING BUDGET FOR FORWARD LOOKING YEARS. ON SLIDE TO THE DECK OF VERY BRIEFLY YOU SEE PATH. IS A SYSTEM WIDE INITIATIVE IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO ACHIEVE A COUPLE OF MAJOR OBJECTIVES THE FIRST OF WHICH IS TO REPLACE. ELEVEN VERSIONS OF OUR AGING PAYROLL SYSTEM ARE WHICH IS BEEN AROUND FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS AND IS IN VARIOUS STATES OF FAILING HEALTH. BUT SIMULTANEOUSLY TO ESTABLISH A SHARED SERVICES CENTER FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIAN PLOYS SYSTEM WIDE. IT PROVIDES A NUMBER OF SERVICES RELATED TO PAYROLL. HUMAN RESOURCES. BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION. AND MANAGEMENT OF THE EMPLOYEE LIFE CYCLE THE NAME YOU SEE PATH ITSELF IS AN ACRONYM THAT CONTAINS A DESCRIPTION OF THE SERVICES IT PROVIDES. PATH STANDS FOR PAYROLL ACADEMIC H. OUR TIME KEEPING AND HUMAN RESOURCES. THE UC PATH CENTER IS LOCATED IN RIVERSIDE CALIFORNIA. AT AT ITS PEAK STAFFING WE EXPECT ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY EMPLOYEES WILL BE PROVIDING. PATH SERVICES. UP TO UPWARDS OF TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. OF THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDING AS PART OF A DEFINED. AND. UNIVERSAL. SERVICE CATALOG THAT EACH CAMPUS WE'LL USE. AND WILL PROVIDE COMMON SERVICES FOR ALL SHE YOU SEE EMPLOYEES. NOT SO UP MANY OF THE SERVICES THAT THE YOU SEE PAST CENTER WILL BE PROVIDING ARE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN PROVIDED HISTORICALLY AT THE CAMPUSES. BOB BUT THEY'VE BEEN PROVIDED IN DIFFERENT WAYS IN A DIFFERENT LEVELS OF QUALITY. UP SO WE ARE CONSOLIDATING AT THE UC PATH CENTER. TO GET THERE. WE STARTED A PROJECT IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TO REPLACE. AN OLD GREEN SCREEN MAINFRAME PAYROLL SYSTEM. WITH. PEOPLESOFT'S HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT APPLICATION AS THE CORE SOFTWARE FOR THE UC PATH INITIATIVE. AND AT THE SAME TIME BEGAN TO BUILD OUT AT THE UC PATH CENTER IN RIVERSIDE. TO DATE WE HAVE. DEPLOYED YOU SEE PATH CHU CHU CAMPUSES. TO THE OFFICE THE PRESIDENT. AND TO THE ASSOCIATED STUDENTS OF UCLA. ALL TOLD THAT'S JUST OVER SIXTEEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES WHO ARE CURRENTLY RECEIVING SERVICES FROM YOU SEE PATH. SLIDE THREE THEN SHOWS THE REMAINING DEPLOYMENTS THAT ARE IN FRONT OF US TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT. IT'S CURRENTLY TARGETED TO COMPLETE IN SEPTEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. THIS SUMMER WE WILL BRING YOU SEE LA AND SANTA BARBARA INTO YOU SEE PATH. WHICH WILL REPRESENT THE FIRST. YOU SEE HEALTH ORGANIZATION THAT WILL COME INTO YOU SEE PATH. AND REALLY AT THAT POINT ARE COMPLETE. THE AVAILABILITY OF YOU SEE PAST SERVICES TO ALL EMPLOYEE TYPES IN THE UC SYSTEM. FROM THERE WE HAVE ANOTHER DEPLOYMENT IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AND AGAIN OUR FINAL DEPLOYMENT IN SEPTEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AT THAT TIME WILL BE SERVING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND YOU SEE EMPLOYEES. SLIDE FOUR SHOWS OUR CURRENT YEAR. BUDGET AND FORECAST FOR THE UC PATH CENTER. THE DIRECT APPROPRIATION IT WAS GIVEN TO THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT THIS YEAR. INCLUDED A LINE ITEM OF FIFTY TWO POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR YOU SEE PATH. ARE THAT WAS ORIGINALLY A BUDGETED TO. BE SPENT ENTIRELY ON YOU SEE PATH CENTER OPERATING COSTS. BUT. SHORTLY AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR. THE UCLA CAMPUS DELAYED ITS DEPLOYMENT OF YOU SEE PATH. IS WHY YOU SEE THEM ON THE PREVIOUS SLIDE LISTED IN THE SEPTEMBER DEPLOYMENT. THAT DELAY CAUSED US TO SIGNIFICANTLY. ARE SLOW DOWN OUR STAFFING RAMP IN ANTICIPATION OF THAT DEPLOYMENT. AND SO. CAUSED US TO SEEK TO OUR. CHANGE OUR FORECAST ON EXPENSES AT THE CENTER TO ABOUT FORTY POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS. THE REMAINING TWELVE POINT TWO MILLION IS BEING SPENT ON. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER ACTIVITIES FROM PROJECT CONSULTANTS TO YOU SEE EMPLOYEES AT THE PAST CENTER. AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE REMAINING TWELVE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR SPENT. SLIDE FIVE THEN SHOWS OUR FORECAST FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL FISCAL YEARS ARE IN SHOWS A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF GROWTH IN YOU SEE PATH OPERATING EXPENSE. IN FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN. TO ACCOMMODATE THE ADDITIONAL STAFF WILL NEED TO BRING ON FOR THE. DEPLOYMENTS THAT WERE LISTED ON SLIDE TO. SO WE EXPECT TO GROW FROM OF FIFTY FOUR EXCUSE ME FIFTY TWO POINT FOUR MILLION THIS YEAR. TO AN OPERATING COST OF SIX A SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION NEXT YEAR. WILL HAVE A A DEBT SERVICE EXPENSE ON TOP OF THAT. TO. ACCOMMODATE THE INITIAL PROJECT ALONE OF TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION. THAT WAS USED TO FUND THE FIRST SEVERAL YEARS OF THE PROJECT. BEYOND THAT THEY AND WE HAVE A CONDITIONAL SMALL AMOUNT OF GROWTH IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY. TO ACCOMMODATE THE FINAL STAFFING NUMBERS FOR THE FINAL DEPLOYMENT AND THEM WERE REALLY AT STEADY STATE. UP WITH THE ADDITION OF OUR PRINCIPAL INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THAT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR LOAN. BEGINNING IN FY TWENTY TWO. UP SO WE END UP JUST UNDER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS  YEAR ANNUAL COST TO PROVIDE. A FULL LIFE CYCLE OF. EMPLOYEE SERVICES TO ALL YOU SEE EMPLOYEES BY FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO. SLIDE SIX OUTLINES THE NATURE OF OUR REQUEST. TO YOU OUGHT TO RETURN THE UC PATH FUNDING MODEL. BACK TO THE FEE FOR SERVICE. THE PIE CHART ON SLIGHT SIX OUTLINES. THE FUNDING SOURCES FOR NON STUDENT EMPLOYEES AT ALL SO YOU SEE LOCATIONS. ARE IN IN THIS YOU SEE THAT STATE GENERAL FUNDS ONLY ACCOMMODATE. APPROXIMATELY SEVENTEEN PERCENT OF OUR PAYROLL EXPENSE ACROSS ALL EMPLOYEE TYPES. THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR OUR PAYROLL COMES FROM AUXILIARY FUNDS OF MOST NOTABLY FROM ARE YOU SEE HEALTH LOCATIONS WHERE ABOUT NINETY SIX NINETY SEVEN PERCENT OF OUR PAYROLL EXPENSE. IS FROM NON GENERAL FUND. SO WHILE WE REQUEST THIS A RETURN TO FEE FOR SERVICE. AND A RETURN OF THE EXISTING APPROPRIATION FOR PATH. BACK TO THE CAMPUSES. WELL AS A WAY OF ALLOWING THE CAMPUSES TO MAKE THE THE BEST DETERMINATION LOCALLY ABOUT THE FUNDS SOURCE TO USE FOR YOU SEE PATH SERVICES. AS IT'S APPROPRIATE. OUT TO THE BUSINESS FUNCTION OF THE CAMPUS. WITHOUT THAT IN PLACE OF WHAT THE LEGISLATURE. ENDS UP DOING IS SUBSIDIZING IN SOME FORM THE PAYROLL EXPENSES OF THE YOU SEE HOSPITALS. ARE AND OTHER NON GENERAL FUND IT. ACTIVITIES IN THE UC SYSTEM. SO THAT'S THE BASIS FOR OUR REQUEST A TO RETURN TO THE FEE FOR SERVICE MODEL. FINALLY THE OPERATING BUDGET AND THE PROJECT COME TOGETHER ON SLIDE SEVEN. THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISKS THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED TO THE REGIONS. IN OUR BRIEFINGS OF YOU SEE PATH FOR THEM. IF YOU LOOK AT THIS CHART. IT'S A BIT BUSY SO LET ME DECOMPOSE IT A BIT FOR YOU THE X. AXIS. IS A FUNCTION OF TIME. AND IT SHOWS YOU THE. THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES AS LISTED IN THE Y. AXIS. OF WHO WILL BE SERVED BY YOU SEE PATH. THERE ARE TWO OF OVAL SHAPED NUMBERS THAT SHOW OUR CURRENT STAFFING IF YOU SEE PATH CENTER. AND OUR TARGET STAFFING AMOUNT FOR THE END OF FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN. THAT'S WHAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE BASIS FOR THE GROWTH IN OUR OPERATING BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN. AS WE ARE CURRENTLY STAFFED. WE ARE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THE LA SANTA BARBARA DEPLOYMENT WITH NO ADDITIONAL STAFFING. BUT IF THE OPERATING BUDGET IS HELD FLAT. OR EVEN WITH A THREE PERCENT BASE ADJUSTMENT. WE WILL NOT HAVE THE STAFFING THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED AS NECESSARY. TO ACCOMMODATE THE FINAL TWO DEPLOYMENTS FOR YOU SEE PATH. AND SO WITHOUT THAT GROWTH IN THE OPERATING BUDGET. WE ESSENTIALLY PUT THE BRAKES ON OUR ABILITY TO FINISH THE APPOINTMENT PROJECT. AND THEREBY EITHER CAUSING US TO INDEFINITELY DELAY THOSE FINAL DEPLOYMENTS. ARE OR TO LOOK FOR OTHER WAYS TO. EITHER REDUCE SERVICES OF WHICH ARE AT THIS POINT. PRETTY ESSENTIAL TO. EMPLOYEE LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT OR OTHERWISE DEGRADE THE QUALITY OF THOSE SERVICES IN TERMS OF SERVICE LEVELS. UP SO AGAIN OUR OUR OUR REQUEST TO RETURN TO THE FEE FOR SERVICE MODEL. I IS TIED TO OUR ABILITY TO GROW THE OPERATING BUDGET IN THE WAY WE DEFINE WITH THE CAMPUSES. WE HAVE BEEN FORECASTING THESE AMOUNTS WITH THE CAMPUSES FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW. THEY ARE PREPARED TO ACCOMMODATE THIS GROWTH. AND IT REALLY IS A PREREQUISITE FOR OUR ABILITY TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT COMPONENT OF YOU SEE PATH. SUCCESSFULLY. MISTER CHAIR THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS OKAY. QUESTIONS. MR MEDINA GROUP. CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT WHAT YEAR DID THE BUILDING OPEN UP THAT RIVERSIDE. THAT'S PROBABLY THE ONE QUESTION I WASN'T ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN BUT I'M GONNA GUESS TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN YES. AND IT'S A BUILDING THAT YOU SEE PURCHASED. OF WE LEASE HALF OF THE BUILDING TO THE UC RIVERSIDE CAMPUS AND HALF TO YOU SEE PATH. TO BOTH ENTITIES PAY RENT IN THAT AND AND AT THIS TIME OF THE UC PATH. IS DOING THE. ALL THOSE DIFFERENT. ACADEMIC PERSONNEL TIME KEEPING HUMAN RESOURCES AND PAYROLL. FOR THE UC RIVERSIDE THE MERCED OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. AND. A A. S. UCLA CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT AT AND IT AND NONE. SOMEHOW I IN ADDITION WE ALSO PROVIDE. SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF THE LEGACY PAYROLL SYSTEM FOR UCLA AND FOR SANTA CRUZ. BECAUSE THOSE CAMPUSES. ARE BOTH AS A RESULT OF REDUCTIONS IN GENERAL FUNDING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND IN ANTICIPATION OF YOU SEE PATH DEPLOYMENT. ALLOWED THEIR PAYROLL DEPARTMENTS TO. DECREASE IN SIZE GENERALLY THROUGH ATTRITION SO WE CAME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THEM RATHER THAN TRYING TO HIRE PEOPLE WHO WOULD ONLY COME ON FOR A FEW YEARS. WE WOULD TAKE ON THOSE SERVICES AT THE UC PASS CENTER SO WE ARE PROVIDING PPS SERVICES THAT'S THE LEGACY SYSTEM FOR BOTH UCLA AND FOR SANTA CRUZ CURRENTLY. LEGACY IN IN ADDITION YOU SEE PATH THEN AND I WOULD ASSUME THAT UC RIVERSIDE WAS DOING ITS OWN. PAYROLL ACADEMIC PERSON ON TIME KEEPING AND HUMAN RESOURCES ALREADY AT RIVERSIDE YET SO WE ARE PROVIDING THE SERVICES FOR ALL EMPLOYEES AT THE RIVERSIDE CAN BUT THEY WERE DOING AND ALL THEY WERE DOING IT FOR THEMSELVES PREFIX FOR THAT CAMPUS. SO IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. RIGHT SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. AND THE LAST FIVE YEARS SINCE IT'S BEEN. THERE. AND IN REALITY IN REALITY ONLY MERCED IN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN ADDED. IN THE FIVE YEARS THAT THAT THAT IT'S BEEN IN EXISTENCE I'M SORRY LET ME CORRECT MY PREVIOUS NOTS ARE. IT MAY BE HELPFUL FIVE PROVIDE A CHRONOLOGY OF OF THE DEPLOYMENTS WE WENT LIVE WITH THE OFFICE THE PRESIDENT IN DISSENT NOVEMBER DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THAT WAS THE FIRST LOCATION. TO BEGIN USING YOU SEE PATH. ARE WE THEN DEPLOYED ARE THE THAT. LOCATIONS ARE IN PRODUCTION LAST DECEMBER SO THAT'S. MERCED RIVERSIDE ACE UCLA. BEGAN USING YOU SEE PATH MOVED OFF THE LEGACY SYSTEM IN DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. BOB SO THEY'VE BEEN ACTIVE WITH YOU SEE PATH FOR ABOUT FOUR MONTHS NOW OKAY. AND THEN. AS YOU SEE IN THE SCHEDULE ON THE THE TIMELINE SLIDE. YOU SEE WHEN THE OTHER LOCATIONS COME ONBOARD. I I BRING IT UP BECAUSE I I WAS AT THE RIBBON CUTTING. FOR THE UC PATH. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING. LOTS OF SPACE. BUT I I'M I'M BRINGING UP THE THE. THE SLOWNESS. OF. OF GETTING. IT OPERATIONAL. FOR OTHER CAMPUSES. I IF I REMEMBER IT'S PROBABLY YOU KNOW. THREE FLOORS SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW A LOT LOUDERSPACE FOR EMPLOYEES THAT YOU'RE LOOKING TOWARDS. FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY. EMPLOYEES AND TWENTY BUT IT IS BEEN A SLOW PROCESS FOR YOU SEE. TO TO MAKE IT OPERATIONAL FOR THE OTHER CAMPUSES. CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT AND I APPRECIATE THE OBSERVATION. THE UC PATH PROJECT. INITIALLY WAS SOLD. I SAY SOLD IT WAS. PRESENTED TO THE REGENTS AS AN OPPORTUNITY. UP TO SAVE MONEY AND AND REALLY FORCE AS A FORCING FUNCTION FOR OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY SYSTEM WIDE. WE KNEW THAT THE LEGACY PAYROLL SYSTEM WHICH WE CALL PPS. FAILING. OUR WE UNDERSTOOD THAT OUT WE HAD SIGNIFICANT COMPLIANCE ISSUES. OUR IN OUR EXECUTION OF PAYROLL BASED ON THE FACT WE HAD ELEVEN SEPARATE VERSIONS OF THE PAYROLL SYSTEM. UP SO I BELIEVE THAT THE ORIGINAL. LEADERSHIP OF THE PROJECT. FELT THAT BY QUICKLY IMPLEMENTING A SOFTWARE SOLUTION. WE WOULD FORCE THE ADOPTION OF A COMMON SET OF BUSINESS PROCESSES. THAT TURNED OUT NOT TO BE THE CASE. AND AND THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE PROJECT. WERE SPENT. ARE IN WHAT I WOULD DESCRIBE AS A RATHER AGONIZING AMOUNT OF. FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE BETWEEN THE CENTRAL PROJECT OFFICE AND THE CAMPUSES. I JOIN THE PROJECT IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AS ITS LEADER. AND AT THAT TIME WE PUT SYSTEM OR SOFTWARE DEPLOYMENT ON HOLD. AND WE SPENT ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS WORKING WITH THE CAMPUS IS TO DEFINE OUR FUTURE STATE BUSINESS PROCESSES. HOW WERE WE GOING TO DO? ALL OF THE FUNCTIONS OF YOU SEE PATH. WHERE WOULD A PROCESS INITIATE WHERE WITH THE HAND OFF TO THE PATH CENTER BE? IF WE NEEDED TO HEAD BACK TO CAMPUS WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE. WE DID THAT FOR A HUNDRED AND FIVE. BUSINESS PROCESSES FROM HIRING DETERMINATION TO. TOP BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. OUR AND WITH THAT CLARITY WE COULD THEN GO BACK AND ACTUALLY BE EFFECTIVE AT. DOING THE WORK ASSOCIATED WITH A IMPLEMENTING THE SOFTWARE COMPONENT OF YOU SEE PATH. ALSO DURING THAT TIME ONCE WE HAD THE BUSINESS PROCESSES DEFINED. WE COULD THEN REALLY LOOK AT. FINISHING THE PLANNING FOR STAFFING UP THE PATH CENTER WE OPEN AT THIRTEEN. BUT IT WAS WITH A SKELETAL CREW THERE WAS A A GROUP OF ABOUT EIGHT PEOPLE FOR THE FIRST YEAR AND A HALF AT THE CENTER BEFORE WE REALLY STARTED HIRING PEOPLE. ARE AND THEY WERE CONCERNED WITH THE BUILD OUT OF THE FACILITY. THEY WERE CONCERNED WITH THE DESIGN OF THEIR COMPONENTS OF PROCESS. BOB AND ARE YOU SEE ADMITS THAT THE EARLY YEARS OF THE PROJECT WERE CHALLENGING. ONCE WE BROUGHT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT LIVE. WE REALLY HAD A PROOF OF CONCEPT THAT. THIS NEW PAYROLL SYSTEM WOULD WORK WE WERE USING IT TO GENERATE PAYROLL FOR YOU SEE EMPLOYEES. ALBEIT. VERY SIMPLE KINDS OF PAYROLL BECAUSE MOST OF THE STAFF AT THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. ARE NOT ACADEMICS STAFF EMPLOYEES. NOT STUDENTS NOT NOT PHYSICIANS. SO A RATHER STRAIGHTFORWARD KIND OF PAYROLL. A TWO YEARS BETWEEN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT DEPLOYMENT. AND B. DEPLOYMENT WE DID LAST DECEMBER. WAS TIME THAT WE SPENT REALLY MAKING SURE THAT WE COULD HANDLE THE COMPLEXITY OF ACADEMIC PAYROLL. BOB YOU HEARD UP THROUGH SOME OF THE COMMENTS. FOR HER IN EARLIER PRESENTATIONS TODAY. ABOUT SOME OF THE COMPLEXITY OF YOU SEE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES PAYROLL ANY RESEARCH INTERESTS INSTITUTION SO COMPLEX. THE FACT THAT ANY GIVEN FACULTY MEMBER CAN HAVE UPWARDS OF THREE TO FOUR DOZEN GRANTS. THAT THEY USED TO PAY BOTH THEMSELVES THEIR RESEARCH ASSISTANTS AND THEY'RE TEACHING ASSIST. AND SO THE DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE RESEARCH FUNDS. FOR EVERY SINGLE PAYROLL. CAN VARY FROM PAY PERIOD TO PAY PERIOD. AND THE SYSTEM HAS TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THAT SO BUILDING. SYSTEM OUT IN A WAY THAT ASSURED ARE ACADEMICS THAT WE COULD DO ACADEMIC PAY CORRECTLY. TOOK THAT AMOUNT OF TIME. AND MOST OF THAT TIME WAS SPENT IN TESTING TO MAKE SURE IT WAS WITHIN TOLERANCES AND FOR US THAT MEANS PAY HAD COME WITHIN. FIVE SENSE OF WHAT WE EXPECTED IT TO BE. SO WE HAVE MET THOSE THRESHOLDS WE ARE NOW LIVE WITH ACADEMICS. IN REALLY THE WORK THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THE REMAINING DEPLOYMENTS FOR PATH. IS MORE ABOUT. ENSURING THAT WE CONVERT LEGACY RECORDS FOR EMPLOYEES AND LESS ABOUT BUILDING SOFTWARE TO DO THE PAYROLL ITSELF WERE DONE WITH THE BUILD FACE. NOW WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON SIMPLY TRANSITIONING EMPLOYEES FROM THE OLD SYSTEM TO THE NEW. SO IT WAS A SLOW START AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. AND WE AND WE MADE EARLY MISTAKES. BUT WERE AND A POINT THE PROJECT NOW WHERE. IT'S A MUCH MORE DEFINED SET OF PROCESSES THAT WE'RE PURSUING. AND OUR ABILITY TO. GET TO THE END OF THE PROJECT. BUT WE HAVE MUCH HIGHER CONFIDENCE THAT WILL MAKE IT WITHIN THE REMAINING BUDGET. AND WITHIN THE TIMELINE THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED. IT IF I COULD DO IS THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S HAVE. ANY INFORMATION ON HOW MUCH MORE IT COSTS. THAN WAS ORIGINALLY PROJECTED. TO TO PHASE AND TWO TO DO THIS TO CHANGE FROM. A DECENTRALIZED PROCESS TO WHAT. SUPPOSED TO BE A COST SAVING. A PROCESS BY CENTRALIZING HOW MUCH MORE AS A COSTS THAN WAS FIRST ESTIMATED. ANYWAY I DO HAVE SOME OF THAT INFORMATION. NOT AT MY FINGERTIPS I'D BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR STAFF ON THAT. BUT I THINK GENERALLY ONE OF THE CHALLENGES HERE IS THAT I'M AS AS YOU SEE INDICATED THIS WAS ORIGINALLY. PRESENTED TO THE REGION'S AS A WAY TO SORT OF. YOU KNOW SAVE COSTS THE IDEA WAS THAT YOU SEE PATH WOULD TAKE OVER A LOT OF SERVICES PAYROLL SERVICES OTHER TYPES OF. HUMAN RESOURCE SERVICES THAT THAT CAMPUSES WERE CURRENTLY DOING AND SO THAT WOULD RESULT IN SOME STAFF SAVINGS. BUT THAT'S NOT CHANGED CAMPUSES ARE NOW INDICATING THAT. THEY AREN'T REALLY. THEY DON'T PRETTY PROJECT TO BE ABLE SERVING HER THOSE SAVINGS ITS MORE ABOUT US SERVE COST AVOIDANCE AND I I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY SORT OF QUANTIFICATION OF THAT SORT OF COST OF WHEN IT'S MOVING FORWARD. I THINK THAT'S SORT OF ONE QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE AS IT CONSIDERS THIS PROPOSAL IS. A WHETHER OR NOT IT IT AGREES THAT CAMPUSES CANNOT SORT OF IDENTIFY THOSE SAVINGS WITH AND THERE'S BUT DIDN'T WITHIN THOSE BUDGETS AND. AND IT CAN'T CAN'T ACTUALLY SERVING GATE WITH YOU SEE PATH IN A WAY THAT SERVER REVISITS THE CONSTRUCTS IN RIVERS THAT SORT OF THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. I THINK I DESERVE ONE QUESTION FACING THE LEGISLATURE ARE ARE ARE YOU SAYING IT WON'T BE. BUT COST SAVINGS. FOR ARE UNDERSTANDING BASED ON WHAT YOU SEE HAS PRESENTED IS THAT A LOT OF THE INITIAL COST SAVINGS THAT WERE PROJECTED. WHERE OUT SOMEWHAT OVER STATEMENTS TODAY TODAY THAT YOU SEE IN THIS CASE THAT IT'S A MORE OF A COST AVOIDANCE NOT? SORT OF THE INITIAL COST SAVINGS THAT WERE INITIALLY PROJECTED WHEN IT WAS PRESENTED TO THE REGENTS. BUT WHEN IT'S A AT CAPACITY IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WILL IT COST YOU SEE LESS. TO RUN OPERATE. SO MR MEDINA WE WE DOCUMENTED THE COST OF DELIVERY OF THESE KINDS OF SERVICES. OUR IT TWO POINTS IN THE PAST WE DID UP A MAJOR INITIATIVE WITH PRICE WATERHOUSE COOPERS IN YOUR TWO THOUSAND. AND WE FOLLOWED THAT UP IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND TEN UNDERSTAND. PRIMARILY AN F. T. E. LEVEL. WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THE DELIVERY OF THE SERVICES? BOB AND IN SOME OF THOSE OF REPORTS. ARE THERE WERE NUMBERS THAT IDENTIFIED OF AREAS WHERE. YOU SEE WAS. ENGAGED IN A LOT OF WASTEFUL ACTIVITY IN THE RE WORK. PAYROLL RELATED ACTIVITIES. IN THE TWO THOUSAND TEN. REPORT FROM PWC THE IDENTIFIED UP TO A HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR. OF RE WORK COSTS FOR MISTAKES IN PAYROLL. SO. GUY I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THE COMPLEXITY OF ACADEMIC. PAY ALLOCATING RESEARCH GRANTS TO TO PAY. ARE IS A HIGHLY MANUAL TASK WHICH WE HAVE NOW ARE SIGNIFICANTLY AUTOMATED IMPASSE. THAT MANUAL WORK RESULTED IN A LOT OF REWORKED BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT OF ERRORS IN IT. SO THERE IS THE REDUCTION OF REWORK EXPENSE. BUT I THINK BY WAY OF ILLUSTRATION IF I MIGHT I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU. OF THE STRATEGY THAT'S IN PLAY AT THE RIVERSIDE CAMPUS. AS YOU'VE IDENTIFIED IN HEARING TODAY. THEY ARE GROWING THEIR SCHOOL OF MEDICINE ALONG WITH OTHER COMPONENTS OF THEIR ACADEMIC PROGRAMS. CHANCER WILCOX HAS IDENTIFIED A RATHER AGGRESSIVE GROWTH POSTURE FOR THAT CAMPUS WANTING TO GROW ELEVEN PERCENT IN THEIR ACADEMIC PROGRAMS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. UP WITH THE RESTRICTION THAT THEY GROW THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS BY ONLY ONE PERCENT OVER THAT SAME PERIOD. UC PATH IS A CORNERSTONE OF THAT STRATEGY TO LIMIT ADMINISTRATIVE COST GROWTH. AS THEY GROW THEIR ACADEMIC PROGRAMS. SO IT'S NOT SEEN AS A. COST REDUCTIONS SO MUCH AS IT IS A LIMITER. ON THE GROWTH OF ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR THE CAMPUSES. WE WILL BE PROVIDING THIS CORE SET OF SERVICES IN A DEFINED WAY. WE'RE REDUCING VARIABILITY IN THOUGH SERVICES WERE BRINGING EFFICIENCY THROUGH SCALE. THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY REDUCE OVERALL COSTS BUT IT CERTAINLY ALLOWS US UP TO PUT CAPS ON ANY GROWTH IN THOSE THOSE EXPENSES. AND AS WE FINISH THIS DEPLOYMENT. WE NOW HAVE A BASE WHERE WE HAVE ALL CAMPUS IS USING A STANDARD SET OF BUSINESS PRACTICES. THAT BOB FROM MY PERSPECTIVE OUR THE PREREQUISITE DEFINING EFFICIENCIES. YOU CAN GET TO EFFICIENCIES IF YOU DON'T STANDARDIZE AND WHAT WE WILL HAVE DONE INITIALLY WITH PATH. IS TO STANDARDIZE THE WAY WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES WITH THE EXPECTATION AND. THAT THE CAMPUSES ARE GOING TO BE. PUTTING SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON US TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING IT AT THE LOWEST UNIT COST AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE PREPARING FOR ONCE WE GET THROUGH THE PROJECT. SO IT'S BEEN ROUGH TO GET THERE. BUT WE'VE BUILT A GREAT FOUNDATION AND I WOULD OBSERVE THAT WITH THIS FOUNDATION WE CAN ALSO THEN LEVERAGE THAT INITIAL INVESTMENT. TO TAKE ON OTHER ADDITIONAL SERVICES. SUCH AS. ABOUT TODAY EACH CAMPUS. HANDLES TRAVEL REIMBURSEMENT. THEIR OWN WAY. IN TYPICALLY THROUGH ACCOUNTS PAYABLE. WELL IF WE'VE GOT THE PATH CENTER AND WE NOW HAVE A PAYROLL OPERATION IN PLACE TODAY. WE COULD SIMPLY MOVE THAT SERVICE TO THE PATH CENTER. AND PROVIDE TRAVEL REIMBURSEMENT AS A NON TAXABLE INCOME COMPONENT FOR THEIR PAYCHECK. IT REDUCES OVERHEAD AT THE CAMPUS IN AT LEVERAGES THE INVESTMENT WE'VE MADE IT THE PATH CENTER. SO THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE SHARED SERVICES THROUGH THE PATH CENTER. BUT WE HAVE TO EXECUTE FINISH EXECUTING ON THE PROJECT COMPONENT OF THIS. SO WE CAN BEGIN TO IND THOSE EFFICIENCIES IN THOSE POINTS SCALE. AND I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. IT DOESN'T I AND I WOULD SAY THAT I APPRECIATE THE EFFICIENCY. ARE I'M A LITTLE BIT TAKEN BACK BY THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IS TAKEN TO GET THERE. AND NUMBER MEDINA I APOLOGIZE I I DO HAVE A THERE IS A RECENT AUDIT OF YOU SEE PATH AND IT DOES PROVIDE THE DATA THAT YOU ASKED FOR YOU LAST FOR. HOURS THE COST ESTIMATE CHANGED OVER TIME AND ON THE DO OF IT PRETTY HELPFUL DISPLAY IN THIS AUDIT. THAT'D BE HAPPY TO SHARE OF YOUR STAFF TO AFTERWARDS BUT ON IT IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WHEN THAT WAS PRESENTED TO THE REGENTS ACCORDING TO THE AUDITOR. A YOU SEE HAD ESTIMATED THE COST OF JUST A JUST OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE FOR THE TOTAL FOR PROJECT COSTS. I'M IN THE ESTIMATED SAVINGS OF ABOUT. A SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS MOST OF THE SAVINGS WOULD BE SORT OF STAFFING REDUCTIONS. I'M IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ACCORDING TO THE AUDITOR'S RECENT ESTIMATES THE COST HAD. ABOUT TRIPLED SO IS JUST OVER NINE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR YOU SEE PATH. AND THERE WERE NO ESTIMATED SAVINGS AS A RESULT OF THAT ACCORDING TO THE AUDITOR. AND SO THESE WERE THE FINDINGS OF THE OF THE RECENT STATE AUDIT. THANK YOU. OKAY MISTER CHAVEZ. VERY INTERESTED IN THIS. WHEN I USED TO DO MY OTHER LIFE. IS THIS A COMPONENT OF THE ACTIVITY BASED COSTING THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKING YOU GUYS TO DO FOR YEARS. NO SIR. TO MY KNOWLEDGE NO BUT THE. YOU SEE REPRESENTATIVE WHO OF SPOKE TO THAT EARLIER IDENTIFIED ONE OF THE CHALLENGES YOU SEE FACES. IN HAVING DISPARATE INFORMATION SYSTEMS. WHAT WE GET OUT OF THIS? BY HAVING ALL YOU SEE PATH OF ALL YOU SEE EMPLOYEES IN A COMMON PAYROLL AND HR SYSTEM. IS VISIBILITY ACROSS ALL LOCATIONS AS TO THOSE COSTS. WHEREAS TODAY. IT'S ELEVEN SEPARATE SYSTEMS AND WE HAVE TO DO A LOT OF INTERPRETIVE GYMNASTICS GET THAT DATA. TO LOOK IN AN ACT COMMON ACROSS ALL OF CEMEX U. DIFFERENT QUESTIONS HER. SHOULD IT BE. OPPONENTS OF THE ACTIVITY BASED COSTING. SHE'S GOING THROUGH I BELIEVE YOU SEE PATH WILL PROVIDE CORE DATA THAT'S CRITICAL FOR ACTIVITY BASED COSTING YES. YOU KNOW WHAT ACTIVITY BASED COST YES SIR. SO EVERYTHING IS SAYING IT'LL SLIDE HERE NUMBER TWOS. THAT I CONSISTENT BUSINESS PRACTICE DAD ACCURACY IMPROVE REGULAR CLIENTS IS ALL PART OF AN ACTIVITY BASED COSTING MODEL. IT'S CORRECT AND ULTIMATELY. OUR THAT MODEL THOUGHT WOULD THEN HAVE OTHER INPUTS. OF FROM SPACE PLANNING FROM ACADEMIC A PROGRAM MODELING. IT WOULD HAVE THE OTHER COMPONENTS NECESSARY TO GET TO THE THE DATA THAT I THINK YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT HAVING THAT COR. ALL EMPLOYEE AND COST COMPONENT OF OFFER YOU SEE EMPLOYEES IS IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THAT YES. SO YOU WERE YOU HAD MADE A COMMENT IS AT THAT LEVEL DIFFERENT SYSTEMS. THAT TICKET TIME BECOME INDIFFERENT ROUTE YOUR FUTURE STATE OF BUSINESS PROCESSES. THAT YOU IDENTIFIED HUNDRED FIVE BUSINESSES PROCESSES HE HAD TO. WORK TO GET HERE. WITH THE OLD SYSTEM THE PPS. AND YOU HAVE CHANGED YOUR DYNAMICS OF. MENTOR STRAIGHT HAVE GROWTH TO THE MEDICAL I THINK YOU SAID THEY'RE GOING TO GO UP ELEVEN PERCENT. OVER THE I GAVE THE EXAMPLE OF RIVERSIDE AND SAN YOUNG YOU WERE GOING ON A CRUISE MINISTRATION COST BY ONE PERCENT PERCENT THAT'S THERE BUT THE SAVINGS. THAT'S ACTUALLY A DEFINITION OF THE ACTIVITY THAT YOU'D BE DOING. AND IN THAT CONNECTOR TO BASE MODEL. IS SO YOU YOU WOULD BE LOOKING AT OTHER. THINGS THAT THE UC DOES. TO REDEFINE THEIR BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT YOU'VE JUST LAID OUT HERE. TO FIND SAVINGS AND I DO HOPE ALL INTENT WE DOING THIS WAS TO PUT. MORE MONEY IN THE EDUCATION OF THE CHILD OTHER STUDENTS AND LESS MONEY AND. ACTIVITIES. THAT'S WHY WE WANTED YOU AS YOU DO IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO. I'M SOMEWHAT CONCERNED. AS A MEMBER WHO'S BEEN A FOR SIX YEARS THEN YOU JUST. BRIEF AN ENTIRE PROJECT DISCUSS KNOWS. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND YOU DID A LINE THE TWO TOGETHER SO THAT MAKES ME THINK. THAT SOMEBODY IT UC'S JUST SMILING AT ME. AND NOT REALLY. TAKING SOMETHIN THAT COULD HELP THEM. TO DO WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING. AM I THINK I'M WRONG. CHAVEZ I BELIEVE THE THE YOU SEE IS. LIKE ALL LARGE INSTITUTIONS NOT ALL COMPONENTS SPEAK EQUALLY WELL WITH EACH OTHER. I HAVE HEARD AND HAVE FOLLOWED THE ACTIVITY BASED COSTING. PILOT WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE IN A COUPLE OF CAMPUSES. I WOULD ALSO OBSERVE THAT YOU SEE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO THINK STRATEGICALLY ABOUT ITS DATA. AND HISTORICALLY YOU SEE DATA HAS BEEN LOOKED AT. A IN A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS THERE IS STOVE PIPED. VERY MUCH SO I KNOW THAT OKAY. I ARE IT WAS ALREADY THERE I I WON'T BELABOR THE OBVIOUS SO THE. SO IF YOU COULD TAKE THIS BACK AT THE LONGER BE GONTIER TO ABOUT ME. AND THE NEXT TIME ABILITY KNOWN ACTIVITY BASED COSTING AS BUT THE IF IF YOU CARED AT THE UC SYSTEM IN THE PAST. AND YOU CAN ONLY DO THIS OF IT COMES FROM THE REGION'S ALL THE WAY DOWN. THAT THEY SAY WE ARE GOING TO. EMBRACE SOMETHING THAT WE TEACH AT OUR BUSINESS SCHOOLS AT THE UC SYSTEM. SO THIS IS A ROCKY CHAVEZ SAYING THAT YOU GET YOUR BUSINESS MODELS ARE BEING TAUGHT YEARS YOUR SCHOOLS WHEN YOU GIVE SOMEBODY AN MBA. UNDER THE UC SYSTEM THEY'RE GOING TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT AN ACTIVITY BASED COSTING MODEL IS. SO YOU TEACH IT. BUT WE DO NOT WANT TO PRACTICE IT. IN OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS THOUGH YOU CAN JUST GO WILL OUT ACTED BASED CASA EDUCATIONS DELUSIONS AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A SERIES OF UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS THAT DO THAT. SO. BUT IT ONLY WORKS YOU CAN READ THOSE TWO. IF AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. EMBRACED AS A VISION FOR THE TOP DOWN SO YOU DON'T HAVE STILL PIPES. BECAUSE ALL STOVE PIPES ARE INHERENTLY INEFFICIENT. AND YOU NEED TO BREAK THEM DOWN SO THAT YOU HAVE AS YOU SAID CORRECTLY HER EARLIER. HOW DO YOU SHARE? FIRST I YOU HAD TO COMMON TERMS AND HOW DO YOU SHARE THE DATA FROM THIS COME TO TERMS. TO FIND THE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE MONEY WHICH WERE TRYING TO DO IN THIS COMMITTEE. SO. IF YOU CARRY THAT MESSAGE BACK LIKE I SAID I'LL BE GONE. BUT THAT'S WHERE YOU NEED TO BE GOING FOR THIS AND I THINK OKAY. THANK YOU GUYS SING NO MORE COMMENTS ON THAT. PARENTS OF THE PATH. SYSTEM I I JUST WANT TO ASK ONE. LOGISTICS MAYBE THIS COULD BE FOR YOU OR SAY HARRIS OR KAREN. IT'S MORE ON ON THE. THAT THE FINANCING OF IT SO AS A STAFF NOTED. THAT THIS IS ALL. PAID FOR IT WITH THE. GENERAL FUND FOR THE THERE ARE YOU SEE. A POOR FUND AND. THERE ARE. MEDICAL PROGRAMS OF COURSE PART OF THIS SO. WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO SPLIT THAT. AND HAVE IT THOSE PROGRAMS PAY FOR IT AND ONLY HAVE THE. HAVE THE NON GENERAL FUND PROGRAMS. PAY FOR THEIR FARE SHARE TENSELY FREEING UP MONEY WE COULD USE FOR. ENROLLMENT GROWTH. THE OTHER TOPIC WE ALWAYS GO. SO IN IN THE REQUEST THAT WE GOT FOR WE HAVE SUBMITTED A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY FOR YOU SEE PATH THAT WOULD RETURN. THE EXISTING ALLOCATION OF GENERAL FUNDS THAT WE RECEIVED THIS YEAR BACK TO THE CAMPUSES WITH THE APPROPRIATE BASE. ADJUSTMENT. OUR AND ALLOW US TO RETURN TO THIS FEE FOR SERVICE MODEL THAT WE IDENTIFIED. THAT. PLACES THE DECISION ON THE FUNDS SOURCE TO PAY FOR PATH AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL. SO FOR EXAMPLE. I GET THAT BUT WHAT ABOUT THE MEDICAL CENTERS SO ARE. CAMPUSES ARE OR OF. VERY GUARDEDAND JEALOUS OF THEIR GENERAL FUNDS AND THE EXPENDITURE OF THOSE FUNDS TO THE HIGHEST VALUE SO YOU KNOW YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE YOU'RE RTF. TAKE IN THE CONSIDERATION AND YOU WILL ENSURE THAT. YOU ONLY USE AS. AS IT NEEDED AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND. THAT THAT IS CORRECT AND WE COULD ALSO SHOW YOU THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S. FUND SOURCE DISTRIBUTION FOR PAYMENT IF YOU SEE PATH BECAUSE WE HAD BEEN ON A FEE FOR SERVICE MODEL. BEFORE THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. SO WE WE CAN DEMONSTRATE HOW THOSE FUNDS CAME TO THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT TO PAY FOR YOU SEE PATH BUT NUMBER MCCARTY ONE. PAGE YOU MIGHT FIND INTERESTING IT'S ACTUALLY IN THE. POWER POINT THAT YOU JUST RECEIVED ON PAGE SIX ON THE UC PATH POWER POINT THAT THE THIRD OR FOURTH YOU SEE POWER WHEN I GOT HER HEAD WAS THE LAST WHEN YOU RECEIVED A NOTICE OF LIKELY ON YOU SEE PATH. THERE'S A THERE'S A PIE CHART THERE YES AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IS WHAT YOU SEE. SAYS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHERE THE SH THOUGH THE STATE AND NON STATE SHARE OF YOU SEE PATH COSTS FOOD THAT'S ABOUT FORTY TWO PERCENT COR FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT NON CORE. SOMEONE OPTION YOU COULD CONSIDER IS LOOK IS LOOK AT SORT OF THOSE COST INCREASES AND ADJUST THAT DOWN. YOU KNOW FORTY TWO PERCENT OR SOME SORT OF COST SHARING RATIO LIKE THAT HOW THE REMAINING COST INCREASE SHARED BY CERTAIN THE NON CORE PORTION OF YOU SEE THAT WOULD AGREE THAT. YOU SEE GENERAL FUND MONEY WE CAN FOCUS ON THE PRIORITIES CORRECT SURE IT YEAH IT'S A LITTLE BIT. IT'S A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED TO THINK ABOUT BECAUSE YOU'RE SORT OF THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF FUN SWAPPING THEIR. ONE OPTION IS A SORT OF A JUST DOWN THE BASE LEVEL IF YOU JUST ON THAT SORT OF FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLAR BASE YOU MIGHT. YOU KNOW REDIRECTS THOUGH THOSE FUNDS BACK TO THE. THE CAMPUS IS BUT IF YOU WORD IT SORT OF SHARE THAT FIFTEEN MILLION DOT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT SORT OF A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE. AND THAT'S SERVING THAT A SAVINGS YES THAT'S ABOUT FORTY TWO PERCENT OF THAT THAT WOULD BE NEW GENERAL FUND AND THEIR MEANING OF THAT YOU COULD YOU COULD CONCEIVE OF ITS OTHER FUNDS THAT YOU CAN. PRIORITIZE FOR OTHER THINGS LIKE ENROLLMENT. OKAY THANK YOU. SINGER FURTHER QUESTIONS WE WILL. HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN. ISSUE NUMBER SIX. I GUESS I'LL JUST I'LL JUST ASK YOU A SIMPLE QUESTION SAY I. MEAN YOU CAN JUST WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS SO IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE WEEKLY I'M. TOOK AN ACTION TO PUT ONE TIME MONEY THE GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THIS EFFORT TO. HELP LCF BUT LCF THAT PLUS STUDENTS. GET INTO THE UC ESSENTIALLY. WHO THEIR REPORT BACK IN OUR ANALYSIS FROM ALEJO SAID WE HAD LIMITED? LIMITED RESULTS IN SO I GUESS THAT THE QUESTION YOU CAN ANSWER IS. IS. WHAT COULD WE DO IF ANYTHING IF WE WANTED TO? TO TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL THAT WE. SOUGHT OUT AND TWENTY SIXTEEN TO ENROLL MORE. LCF AT PLUS STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS IN THE UC. THINK YOUR TERM MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. WITH THE ENROLLMENT COMPONENT THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A TIMING ISSUE WITH HOW UC ADMITS WHEN WE RECEIVED THE FUNDS AND WHEN THEY WERE SENT TO CAMPUSES. AND WHEN STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY ADMITTED SO WE ASK THE ALL OF THE CAMPUSES TO WRITE PROPOSALS FOR HOW THEY WOULD SPEND THE FUNDS THAT THEY RECEIVED. THEY WERE GOING TO RECEIVE BETWEEN TWENTY AND FORTY PERCENT OF THE TWENTY MILLION WOULD BE SPREAD FOR BETWEEN THE CAMPUSES FOR ENROLLING NEW STUDENTS FROM LC FF PLUS HIGH SCHOOLS. THEY DIDN'T GET THOSE FUNDS UNTIL JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHEN THE. APPLICATIONS FOR FALL HAD ALREADY CLOSED. SO THAT'S WHY FOR FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN YOU DIDN'T REALLY SEE THE IMPACT OF THOSE FUNDS ON THE RECRUITMENT OF HEALTH CFF STUDENTS. THE RECRUITMENT OF STUDENTS CONTINUED ALL THROUGH THE SPRING AND THE FOLLOWING FALL AND WE ANTICIPATE SEEING IMPACT. FOR FOOTBALL TWENTY. ODD YEAH FOOTBALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN SORRY IS FOR BALL TWENTY. A. YES BUT THIS COMING FALL WE ANTICIPATE SEEING IMPACT FROM UP THE USE OF THESE FUNDS I GUESS RIGHT NOW STAFF OF STUDENTS. DID IT WORK. SO THERE WERE SOME YOUNG GRABS YES SIR ON THERE WERE SOME PROGRAMS THAT WERE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE SORT CAMPUSES. CAME UP WITH THEIR PLANS FOR SERVE THEIR STUDENTS IN DIFFERENT WAYS. THE DIFFERENT CAMPUSES. BOB LOOKED TO THINGS THAT THEY THOUGHT COULD REALLY ASSIST THEIR STUDENTS OFF FOR EXAMPLE UC DAVIS HIRED AN ACADEMIC ADVISER. WHOSE JOB WAS RATHER THAN THE PASSIVELY WAIT FOR STUDENTS TO MAKE IT APPOINTMENT. ACTIVELY MADE APPOINTMENTS WITH STUDENTS FROM LCF OF HIGH SCHOOLS WHO AFTER THEIR FRESHMAN YEAR WERE ON ACADEMIC PROBATION. AND MET WITH THOSE STUDENTS DISCUSSED THEIR INDIVIDUAL CONCERNS WITH THEM AND DIRECTED THOSE STUDENTS TO CAMPUS RESOURCES THAT WOULD HELP THE STUDENT. AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT OF THE POPULATION THAT THIS ACADEMIC ADVISER MET WITH THERE'S A TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT REDUCTION IN DROPOUT COMPARED TO OTHER STUDENTS WHO WERE ON ACADEMIC PROBATION FROM LCF OF HIGH SCHOOLS. SO CLEARLY THERE WAS SOME IMPACT THEIR THAT STUDENT CONTINUATION WAS INCREASE. I UCLA USED SOME OF THE FOR FUNDING FOR LOOKED A LEARNING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WHICH IS A SERVER APPEARED TO PEER MENTORING PROGRAM.% DRUG PROGRAMS INCREASED FROM SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENTS TO THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS QUARTERLY A PARTICIPATION. AND WHAT WE FOUND. IS STUCK PERSISTENCE RATES AND THAT PROGRAM WENT UP BY THREE PERCENT OR THE FOR THE STUDENTS AS A WHOLE WHO PARTICIPATED VERSUS. OUR STUDENTS FROM LCF OF PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROGRAM. SO WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT SORT OF FACE TO FACE CONTACT INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION FOR THE STUDENTS. ARE REALLY POSITIONS WHETHER PURE MENTORS OR US. WHO ASSISTED STUDENT IN FIGURING OUT HOW THE NAVIGATE? THE UNIVERSITY THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ROLLED IN SEEM TO BE REALLY HELPING AND PERSISTENCE RATES. OTHER. A ACTIONS TAKEN BY CAMPUS UC MERCED WHICH OUGHT IS SOMEWHAT REMOTELY LOCATED. IS DEVELOPING AN ONLINE ORIENTATION FOR NEW STUDENTS WHO CAN'T TRAVEL THERE BEFORE SCHOOL STARTS. AND ATTEND AN IN PERSON ORIENTATION SO THAT THEY CAN TAKE THE ORIENTATION ONLINE FIND OUT WHERE ON CAMPUS DIFFERENT SERVICES ARE LOCATED AND IF THE STUDENT HAS A QUESTION WHERE TO GO TO RECEIVE THOSE QUESTIONS ANSWERED. SO. WE DO BELIEVE THAT THESE FUNDS HAVE HAD AN IMPACT WE'RE STILL STUDYING IT BUT. DEFINITELY IT APPEARS THAT INCREASING ACADEMIC ADVISING AND ALSO FOR CERTAIN OF EXPRESSWAY STEM FIELD MAJORS. INCREASING EARLY ON PEER TO PEER ADVISING IT WITHIN THOSE MAJORS. APPEAR TO BE OUR TUTORING. APPEARS TO HAVE AN IMPACT IN THE PERSISTENT RATES THE STUDENTS. OKAY THANK YOU. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SEEING NONE THANK YOU FOR THEIR REPORTS. WE'LL NOW GO TO PUBLIC COMMENTS. PLEASE LINE UP. IN THE. CENTER THERE. PLEASE. KEEP YOUR COMMENT TO ONE MINUTE OR LESS PLEASE SIXTY SECONDS OR LESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN GREG EARNER WITH CARBON RECEIVERS ON BEHALF OF EXPAND IF ADDICTS. I'M WE'VE BEEN WATCHING WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN DOING IN RELATION TO THE OPIOID CRISIS. THEY'VE WRITTEN RECENTLY ALLOCATED A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS AN EXPANDED. WHAT THAT MONEY CAN BE USED FOR INCLUDING RESEARCH AND TO NON OPIOID PAIN RELIEVERS AND PAIN MANAGEMENT? UC DAVIS IS IN A PARTICULARLY GREAT POSITION WITH SOME A SMALL STATE INVESTMENT TO PULL DOWN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THIS MONEY. UC DAVIS HAS THE CENTER FOR ADVANCING PAIN RELIEF AN EGG AND A PARTNERSHIP WITH VETERINARY MEDICAL SCHOOL. THAT IS LOOKING AT BOTH OF THESE AREAS. WE WOULD LIKE THOSE SUBCOMMITTEE TO CONSIDER A SMALL STATE INVESTMENT AND PUT THE UC SYSTEM. IN A POSITION TO LOOK TOWARDS THE FUTURE OF BEYOND OPIOIDS AND LOOKING AT WHAT WE CAN DO IN THIS AREA. A PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THIS BUT WE LOOK FORWARD YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. BARELY AFFORDING BASIC NEEDS AND HOUSING COSTS PACKED BY THE HUNDREDS IN LECTURE HALLS WITH NO VENTILATION AND SITTING ON THE FLOOR OF SOME OF MY DISCUSSION SECTIONS. I'D BE LYING IF I TOLD YOU THAT I DIDN'T OUT MY DECISION FOR COMMITTING TO UC BERKELEY. THESE EXPERIENCES WERE NOT RARE IN MY FIRST SEMESTER AT POWELL AND ARE CERTAINLY NOT UNIQUE TO ME. MY NAME IS ALICE SMITH AND I'M A FIRST YEAR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. AND ALMOST SCHOOL SPIRIT AND PRIDE SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE I CARE MORE ABOUT MY SCHOOL THAN HE CARES FOR ME. I'M THANKFUL FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES AT THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTER BUT WHEN I TRIED TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEMESTER. THE SOONEST SOMEONE COULD SEE ME WOULD BE IN A FEW WEEKS. WHEN I TRY TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT CLOSE TO FINALS IN THE HEIGHT OF MY ANXIETY THE SOONEST SOMEONE COULD SEE ME WOULD BE NEXT SEMESTER. MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES ACADEMIC RESOURCES BASIC NEED SECURITY I COULD GIVE YOU DIATRIBE AFTER DIATRIBE GRANT AFTER RANTS ABOUT THE RESOURCES STUDENTS NEED AND THE OBSTACLES WE FACE. I AM PROUD TO BE A UC STUDENT AND TO SEE SO MANY STATE LEGISLATORS TO BE YOU SEE ALUMNI BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT OUR EXPERIENCES. ARE DIFFERENT FROM YOURS AS OUR REPRESENTATIVES I HOPE YOU CONSIDER YOU SEE STUDENTS CONSIDER YOUR UC EXPERIENCE CONSIDER OUR CHALLENGES WHEN YOU DECIDE WHETHER TO SUPPORT AN INCREASE IN HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING. GIVE. US STEAMED AT CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS AMY HINDSIGHT I'M A MOM AND THE HIGHER EDUCATION DIRECTOR OF THE RE CLEAN CA HIGHER EDUCATION COALITION. AT PRESENT THE UC RETIREMENT SYSTEM. IS BEING ERODED BY A WRONG HEADED APPROACH TO ADDRESSING FUNDING CONCERNS NAMELY ALLOWING A FOUR OH ONE K. OPT OUT FROM THE DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY LEAVE IT LIKE ACTUAR EARLY ON SOUND. AS YOU SEE IS THE LARGEST EMPLOYER IN CALIFORNIA IT WOULD STAND TO REASON THAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE ECONOMY MAY BE INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT ITS RETIREES ARE ABLE TO RETIRE WITH DIGNITY. WE URGE THE STATE TO FUND THE STATE PORTION OF YOU SEE OUR S. SO THAT ATTACKS ON THE PENSION WILL BE WALKED BACK. AND THE THREE UNIONS HER CURRENTLY IN BARGAINING OVER THIS ISSUE ASKED ME LOCAL THIRTY TWO NINETY NINE CNA AND UP THE CW A LOCAL NINETY ONE NINETEEN. CAN REST ASSURED RIGHT NOW ALL THREE UNIONS ARE CURRENTLY COLLECTING STRIKE AUTHORIZATION PLEDGES AND ARE HOLDING STRIKE VOTES IN THE COMING WEEKS. WE CONTINUE TO STAUNCHLY OPPOSED TO TWO POINT FIVE PERCENT TUITION AND FIVE PERCENT FEE INCREASE THE UC REGENTS ARE SCHEDULED TO LEVY AGAINST STUDENTS TO MAKE UP FOR THE LOT JOB THE STATE IS REFUSING TO DEAL. IMPOSING MODEST TUITION INCREASES OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS CONTINUES TO ADD FINANCIAL BY ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL BURDEN ON STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE HYPHAE HIGH AID MODEL HAS FAILED AS IS EVIDENCED BY THE STUDENT DEBT CRISIS WE DEMAND STUDENT DEBT RELIEF AND A REPUDIATION OF THE HI FI HIGH EIGHT MODEL IN FAVOR OF ACTUAL. PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN OUR HIGH PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHEN MCCARTYOTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND MY NAME IS LINDSAY HENDRIX AND I A MENU TRANSFERRED TO UCLA FOR THE CALIFORNIA ME COLLEGE. ATTORNEYS HERE A WAS ONE OF MY BIGGEST DREAMS AND WHEN I SEE RECEIVED MY ACCEPTANCE LETTER ALMOST EXACTLY A YEAR AGO TODAY I CANNOT EVEN DESCRIBE. THE JOY AND EXCITEMENT I FELT. HOWEVER STUDIES HILL A HAS BEEN FILLED WITH ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE BUT. IT IS ALSO HAD MANY EXPECTS BACK TO CHALLENGES. CHALLENGES LIKE HAVING TO SIT ON THE FLOOR STAND DURING LECTURE MISS OUT ON NEW MATERIAL BECAUSE OF OVERSTRETCHED YEAS AND HAVING TO DROP MY SECOND MAJOR BECAUSE OF WILD THE IMPACT OF CLASSES. THIS ALL NEGLECT TO MENTION THE VERY REAL POSSIBILITY THAT I WILL SOON HAVE TO PAY MUCH MORE FOR THE SAME EXPERIENCE. THE UC SYSTEM IS SOMETHING THAT I AND SO MANY OTHER TRANSFERS BOTH FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS WELL AS OTHER HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS HAVE HISTORICALLY STROVE TO BE A PART OF. WITHOUT MAJOR CHANGES IN INCREASES TO YOU SEE STATE FUNDING I DO NOT THINK THAT THIS WILL REMAIN TRUE AND MANY TRANSFER STUDENTS WILL PROBABLY LOOK ELSEWHERE TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION. THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS THAT HAVE ALREADY SHOWN THEIR SUPPORT POLICE THE BUDGET PASSED PARTICULARLY AND NUMBER MCCARTY FOR GIVING CONSIDERATION TO OTHER. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS AMANDA ELLIOTT NAM A CURRENT FRESHMAN AT UCLA. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR MY PARENTS WERE BOTH STUDENTS AT UCLA WHERE THEY MET.

FOR SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND THE ON CALIFORNIA. THE UC SYSTEM IS A FAMILY. WHENEVER I SEE THAT UCLA LICENSE PLATE ARE YOU STILL A BASEBALL CAP. I KNOW THAT THAT'S A FRIENDLY FACE. THE UC FAMILY HAS GROWN A LOT OVER THESE PAST FEW DECADES WHICH IS A GREAT THING. IT MEANS MORE OPPORTUNITY MORE ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION FOR MORE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. IT MEANS MORE EDUCATED WORKERS FOR CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. HOWEVER. WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO EXPAND ACCESS AND CAPACITY FOR AS MANY STUDENTS AS WE BEGAN TO ARE ALL. MY PARENTS ARE ALWAYS SURPRISED TO SEE HOW MANY NEW DORMS AND DINING HALLS ARE BUILT ON UCLA'S CAMPUS BUT IT STILL ISN'T ENOUGH. FOR ONE MY FINALS LAST QUARTER I SAT ON THE FLOOR FOR TWO HOURS WHILE I TOOK MY FINAL BECAUSE THERE JUST WASN'T ROOM IN THE CLASSROOM. FOR EVERY STUDENT. I CURRENTLY LIVE IN A DORM WITH TWO OTHER STUDENTS IN A DORM THAT WAS INTENDED FOR TO STUDENTS ALONE. I GOING TEARS SEMESTERS WITHOUT MEETING MY TEACHER'S FACE TO FACE BECAUSE THE LINE TO GET INTO OFFICE HOURS IS SO LONG THAT STUDENTS CAN'T EVEN SPEAK ONE ON ONE WITH THEIR TEACHERS.

UC BERKELEY I ALSO LEAD RISE CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE AN INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND COMMUNITY COLLEGE SERIOUS YOU AND YOU SEE STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE. OUGHT TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WHO SIGNED ON TO JOSE MEDINA IS BETTER. CALLING ON. PRIORITIZING THE BUDGET ASK FOR YOU SEE BUT I ALSO WANT TO SAY IN A STATE WITH A SIX POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR. BUDGET SURPLUS THIS YEAR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS MORE FOR YOU SEE IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH. IT'S NOT NEARLY ENOUGH WE'VE CUT MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FROM UC BERKELEY'S BUDGET ALONE.

THIS SHOULD BE THE CASE CALIFORNIANS SHOULDN'T BE IN THOUSANDS OR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF DEBT JUST TO GET THEIR BACHELORS DEGREE. HIGHER EDUCATION CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE FREE THE WAY IT WAS FOR A HUNDRED YEARS AND I HOPE THAT AS OUR PUBLIC SERVANTS YOU'LL WORK TO DEFEND STUDENTS AND PREVENT THE MONETIZATION OF CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. ALSO HIGHER EDUCATION IS THE PRIMARY PLATFORM THAT ALLOWS LOW INCOME AND MINORITY STUDENTS ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITIES AND PAVE THEIR PATH TO SUCCESS AND THAT INCLUDES ME. WHEN YOU'RE CONSIDERING FUNDING FOR THE UC SYSTEM PLEASE THINK OF THE REAL IMPACT ON US THE NEW GENERATION OF CALIFORNIA'S LEADERS THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS HUNTER STERN I'M A FIRST YEAR UC SANTA CRUZ OF. THE UC'S. FOR. PRESSURE. TWO OVER ENROLL IN THE UC SYSTEM COUPLED WITH POOR FUNDING HAS THREATENED THE PRESTIGIOUS. STATUS OF THE UC SYSTEM CAMPUS IS TRYING TO KEEP PACE WITH THE ENROLLMENT TARGETS WITHOUT. THE NECESSARY ADDITIONAL FUNDING ARE FORCED TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE QUALITY OF. OF THE EDUCATION OFFERED FOR EXAMPLE. AT UC SANTA CRUZ THE VAST MAJORITY OF STUDENTS ENROLLED IN CALCULUS FOR ENGINEERING ONE TWO AND VECTOR CALCULUS. MUST TAKE THOSE CLASSES ONLINE WHICH HAS. A MARKEDLY NEGATIVE AFFECT ON STUDENT ENGAGEMENT AND MORALE. WE STUDENTS AND POOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ADEQUATELY FUND THE UC SYSTEM SO THAT IT MAY. MEET ENROLLMENT QUOTAS SET. THE STATE WITHOUT. SACRIFICING ITS WORLD CLASS STATUS. CLOSE FAMILY MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SPEAK TODAY. MY NAME IS KAREN ELLIOTT I'M A FIRST YEAR POLITICS MAJOR UC SANTA CRUZ. AND THANK YOU FOR PUTTING ALL THE EFFORT DAY ARE INTO TRYING TO ENHANCE. AND EXPAND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA APPRECIATED. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME AS A STUDENT. AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO THE STATE'S ECONOMIC FUTURE. CALIFORNIA'S CURRENTLY THE SIXTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. AND THE MAINTENANCE OF THE STATUS IS DEPENDENT. ON WHETHER WE CAN FILL THE ONE POINT ONE MILLION JOBS THAT WILL REQUIRE A COLLEGE EDUCATION BY TWO THOUSAND THIRTY. THAT ARE CURRENTLY PROJECTED TO BE. NOT FILLED UP BY THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE. OF CALIFORNIA. AND IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY OVER ENROLLING STUDENTS AND WE ARE FEELING THE PRESSURE OF OVER ENROLLMENT YOU SEE WIDE. NOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY OF AUTHORED AB TWENTY TO FORTY EIGHT. WHICH REQUIRES. SINCE TAKE FIFTEEN YOU INSENSITIVE TWELVE UNITS AND I. APPRECIATE THE SENTIMENT THAT YOU WERE. PUTTING FORTH AND THIS BILL. ANITA HAS GOOD INTENTIONS. I BELIEVE. ITS A GOOD EFFORT TO TRY AND ALLEVIATE OVER IN ROME AND MAKE SINCE GRADUATE FASTER. HOWEVER. I FEAR THAT I COULD HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE QUINCES. BECAUSE THEIR STUDENTS TO WORK BUT THEMSELVES THROUGH COLLEGE. THEIR STUDENTS WHO WERE TAKING TWELVE UNITS BECAUSE THERE. STEM MAJORS THEY'RE TAKING. CLASSES LIKE ORGANIC CHEMISTRY IN HIGH LEVEL CALCULUS CLASSES. THAT DO NOT EQUATE TO MIND NINETEEN UNITS OF POLITICS CLASSES. THEIR TIME INVESTMENT IS GREATER AND I FEEL THAT. THE. THE NUMBER OF UNITS ARE YOU TAKE IS AN ARBITRARY NUMBER. IS NOT NECESSARILY PAN TO. THE TIME COMMITMENT THAT WAS STUDENT MAKES. SO INSTEAD. I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON A. B. THIRTY ONE FIFTY THREE. WHICH WOULD EXPAND SUMMER CAL GRANT. FOR TWO ADDITIONAL SUMMER SESSIONS. AND THIS WOULD ALLOW STUDENTS. PERSONAL THE SMEARS WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ALREADY DONE. BY SUPPLYING FINANCIAL AID STINSON SUMMER. AND. IT WOULD STUDENTS. STUDENTS DON'T TAKE LOWER NUMBERS OF UNITS BECAUSE. THEY DON'T THEIR LAZIER THEY DON'T WANT TO OR. WHATEVER WHAT HAVE YOU RIGHT. THEY TAKE LESS UNITS BECAUSE. THEY HAVE TO. LIKE STUDENTS ARE MOTIVATED TO TRAIN GRADUATE AS FAST AS THEY CAN. BY THE WOMEN DEBT. THAT THEY'RE FACING. OKAY. HOW TO ASK YOU TO? WRAP IT UP GREAT COMMENTS OR TWO AND HALF MINUTES THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS TIME THANK YOU FOR. BEING HERE TODAY IN FRIDAY'S OR TWO YOU CAN THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS BRIAN ASTORIA AND I'M A MEMBER OF YOU SEE ESSAY AND I'M STUDENTS AND AGENCY. ALONG WITH MY PEERS BEHIND THE WORST YEARS FROM UC BERKELEY AND WE'RE HERE TO ASK FOR YOU TO FUND YOU SEE. COMMITMENTS I'VE BEEN TO A FEW THESE HEARINGS BUT MR MCCARTY EARLIER HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING THAT HURT THROUGHOUT THESE HEARINGS. THE MAIN THING THEIR CONSTITUENTS AT HOME CARE ABOUT IS THAT THEIR CHILDREN GET UC'S. VERY VALID AND I BELIEVE THIS OVERLAPS WITH HESITANCE BRASS DEPLETE MONEY YOU SEE. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT IS NOT OUR FAULT OUR FAULT THE UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATORS AND PRACTICES THAT PUT US AND INCOMING STUDENTS AND SUCH FORMAL SITUATIONS. HAVE WORSENED HOUSING AND FOOD INSECURITIES AT EACH CAMPUS IS NOT OUR FAULT. I ALSO WANT TO CLARIFY IN KISSIMMEE HAVE BEEN MISCONSTRUED AYE WE'RE NOT HERE TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF THE YOU SEE WE ARE HERE TO ALKI I'M HAVE STUDENTS. ESPECIALLY THE MARS LISTA POPULATION AT EACH CAMPUS. WITH THAT SAID I HOPE YOU CAN CLARIFY REFLECT ON WHY THE BLAME IS ONLY PUT ON YOU SEE WHEN THE STATE HAS COME. SISTERLY DIVESTED FROM HIGHER EDUCATION. MR MCCARTY YOU'D KNOWLEDGE THAT OVER THE PAST DECADE HAS BEEN THE CASE BUT THE RECESSION WAS AT FAULT. HOWEVER OVER THE PAST FOUR DECADES STATE FUNDS PER STUDENT HAS BALLING CLOSE TO SIXTY FIVE PERCENT. WE ARE PUSHING FOR MORE ROLL IT OR MOMENT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAT YOU CAN MIND THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION IS DETERIORATING. WITH OTHER RESOURCES TO MEET THE STUDENTS. YOU SEE CALPERS BEACON HELP US BY PUTTING THE UC THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS KATE LARSEN I'M A FIRST YEAR STUDENT AT UC BERKELEY. MY MOTHER CRIED WHEN I TOLD HER THAT I WANT TO GO TO UC BERKELEY THESE WERE NOT TEARS OF JOY. EVEN THOUGH BERKELEY WAS THE ONLY SCHOOL THAT I COULD ATTENDING GRADUATE WITH MINIMAL THAT'S AND IT WAS ALSO THE BEST SCHOOL THAT I GOT INTO SHE KNEW THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE PERSONAL ATTENTION FROM MY PROFESSORS. SHE KNEW THAT I WOULD HAVE TO SIT ON THE FLOOR OF MY LECTURE HALLS THAT HAVE FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS IN THEM. BE AND SHE KNEW THAT I WOULD GET WAIT LISTED FOR THE LAST TWO CLASSES I NEED TO DECLARE MY MAJOR. THAT I WOULDN'T BE GUARANTEED ON CAMPUS HOUSING EVEN AS A FRESHMAN. THESE ARE THE REALITIES OF OVERCROWDING CAMPUSES A LACK OF HOUSING OF CLASS SPACE OF RESOURCES. THIS WASN'T THE CASE FOR PREVIOUS GENERATIONS FOR YOUR GENERATION AT UC CAMPUSES CURRENTLY ENROLLED YOU SEE STUDENTS AND THE NEXT GENERATION ARE WORTHY OF THE SAME GREAT YOU SEE HAS PASSED EATONS. AND WE WILL DO GREAT THINGS FOR THE STATE THE PUBLIC GOOD AND OUR COMMUNITIES IN RETURN FOR THE STATE'S INVESTMENT. PLEASE NOTE WE ALL SAY INVESTMENT NOT FUNDING WE ARE NOT JUST REQUESTING A ONE TIME BAILOUT WE WANT THE STATE TO PUT ITS TRUST IN THE FUTURE THAT ACCESSIBLE EDUCATION PROVIDES. THANK YOU TO THOSE OF YOU WHO SIGNED I'M ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA AS LETTER AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PROMISES TO HELP THE STUDENTS PLEASE ACT ON YOUR PROMISES. WE DON'T HAVE MONEY OR AN ARMY OF LOBBYISTS TO PERSUADE YOU BUT WE AS STUDENTS ARE WORTH THE INVESTMENT. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ANGIE CHEN I'M A SECOND YEAR STUDENT AT UC BERKELEY WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT CAMPUS MAINTENANCE COURSE AVAILABILITY AND STUDENT TO FACULTY RATIO BUT I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THESE AREN'T JUST STUDENT ANECDOTES. THESE ARE CONCRETE ISSUES THAT HAVE REALLY REAL IMPACTS ON THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION I HAVE MY CLASSES IN COSTUMES WITH BROKEN CHAIRS AND CHALKBOARDS THAT DON'T WORK. NEXT WEEK I'M ROLLING MY FALL SEMESTER COURSES THE MANY OF THE CLASSES I NEED FOR MY MAJOR AND FOR GRADUATION ARE ALREADY FILLED UP. AN INCREASE ENROLLMENT HAVE IS RESULTED IN MASSIVE OVERCROWDING THE DATA SCIENCE COURSE THAT I'M IN RIGHT NOW IS OVER ROLLED SO MUCH THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAD TO TURN STUDENTS AWAY FROM LECTURE BECAUSE THE LECTURE HALL CAN'T FIT THE THOUSANDS OF ENROLLED STUDENTS IN THAT CLASS. IT'S CLEAR THAT THE UC SYSTEM DESPERATELY NEEDS THIS FUNDING IS THE INVESTMENT IS INADEQUATE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN FALLS ON THE STUDENTS I JUST WISH THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD PRIORITIZE IMPROVING AFFORDABILITY RESOURCES AND ACADEMIC SUCCESS FOR FOR CURRENT STUDENTS. BEFORE TALKING ABOUT EXPANDING ACCESS THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS JEN DRIVE A I'M PROBABLY THE ONLY COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENTS HERE FROM UC BERKELEY. ARM AND I JUST WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE POINTS THAT WERE MENTIONED ABOUT OVERCROWDING. NOW I APPRECIATE THE UC REPRESENTATIVES COMMENTS. ABOUT. THE UC SYSTEM AND HOW IT REFLECTS THE OVERCROWDING THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW BUT. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT. SHE MIGHT OF UNDERSTATED THE SITUATION RIGHT NOW. I WALK INTO MOFFIT LIBRARY ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR LIBRARIES ON CAMPUS. AND IT IS LITERALLY FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH STUDENTS SITTING ON THE GROUND BECAUSE THERE'S NO OTHER PLACE TO STUDY. IMAGINE WALKING INTO YOUR OFFICE AND THEY'RE BEING TWENTY PEOPLE SITTING ALL OVER THE GROUND AND YOU NOT BE ABLE TO GET YOUR DESK. THAT'S RIDICULOUS. I ALSO SEE IN MY OWN RESIDENTIAL HOUSE WHERE. IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM. PEOPLE TAKE THE CLOTHES OUT OF THE LAUNDRY MACHINES AND THROW THEM ALL OVER THE PLACE BECAUSE THEY'RE SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH LARGER ROOMS FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO WAIT THE FULL PERIOD OF THE LAUNDRY CYCLE. SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE THEIR OWN LAUNDRY DONE I SEE PEOPLE DRYING THEIR CLOTHES IN THE COMMON ROOM OF OUR FLOOR BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH SPACE IN THEIR OWN ROOM OR NOT ENOUGH LAUNCH CAPACITY FOR THAT TO HAPPEN BY ITSELF. I SAW OR COMEDY ROOM IN THE FIRST SEMESTER OF MY YEAR BEING FILLED WITH FOR STUDENTS THIS IS A ROOM THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO OFFER STUDY SPACE AND AN AREA FOR PEOPLE TO SOCIALIZE. BEING FILLED WITH STUDENTS OVERCAPACITY BECAUSE THEY'RE SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH HOUSING AT UC BERKELEY THIS IS ALL A RIDICULOUS SITUATION AND I HOPE THAT YOU RECONSIDER SUCH A PROPOSAL TO ADD MORE STUDENTS. WITHOUT ACTUALLY ADDING MORE CAPACITY THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS CONNOR HE'S IN ON AN UNDERGRADUATE AT THESE AT UC BERKELEY. INSTANCE SENATOR AT OUR STATE GOVERNMENT ACC I'M SORRY IF MY WAS CAN LEARN MOST SICK BUT THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR ME. ON A SPECIFIC YOU FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE STILL ASSUME THIS PUBLIC COMMENT. AND AGAIN THIS HEARING I HEARD ONE OF YOU SAY THAT YOU HEAR ANECDOTES ABOUT STUDENTS ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES ALL THE TIME. AND WE ARE STUDENTS MISSING CLASS ON OUR OWN ACCORD TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT IS HAPPENING ON OUR CAMPUSES ON SAID THESE SIXPENCE XIN OPTUS. I'VE ACQUIRED CLASS FOR MY MAJOR THAT HAS GROWN BY FIFTY PERCENT IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS. ALTHOUGH DISCOMFITURE SINCE STUDENTS THE NUMBER OF GRAD STUDENTS DOCTORS R. T. A.'S OR GRADERS HAS NOT RUN AT ALL. SOMETHING HAPPENED THIS YEAR WHERE THEY COULD NOT COMPETE WITH THAT AND OPPRESSORS LITTLE CANCELED MID TERMS. BECAUSE THAT I'VE GOT NO FEEDBACK ON MY WORK FOR THE YEAR THE FIRST FEEDBACK WILL GET IS MY ACTUAL FINAL. OR QUALITY OF EDUCATION HAS DECREASED. THIS IS A DIFFERENCE IN QUALITY THAN WHAT YOU RECEIVED WHEN YOU'RE. WHEN YOU'RE IN COLLEGE. OUR PROFESSORS HAVE TO CUT CONTENT AND LECTURE BECAUSE THE SYSTEMS UNDER FUNDED. AND WHILE I AGREE THAT THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE AS SUCCESSFUL AS POSSIBLE YOU'RE ASKING US TO DO MORE WITH LESS. FUNDS FOR STUDENT HAVE CONTINUE FALL IN THE QUALITY OF OUR EDUCATION IS FALLING WITH IT. HELP US FROM THE C.. THANK YOU. WHO DO BUILT UP? HI MY NAME'S NEAL I FIRST I JUST WANTED TO REAFFIRM THAT NONE OF US ARE BROUGHT HERE BY THE YOU SEE WERE BROUGHT HERE ON HER OWN ACCORD. I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE. I HATE PERSONAL HE WOKE UP AT SIX IN THE MORNING TO BE HERE I'VE BEEN TO TO THESE MEETINGS I'VE BEEN TO REGENTS MEETINGS. AND I'VE LOBBIED DURING MY SPRING BREAK FOR YOU SEE FUNDING I'M HERE BECAUSE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME. I KNOW THAT YOU'VE ALL OF KIND OF HEARD ALL THESE DIFFERENT TESTIMONIES ABOUT HOW WERE AFFECTED BY LACK OF FUNDING. AND SO I DID WANT TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT BUILDINGS ARE FALLING APART LITERALLY AT UC BERKELEY. THERE'S UNBELIEVABLE OVERCROWDING A LACK OF BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE HEATING AND AIR CONDITIONING AND MAJOR CLASSROOMS AND BUILDING WE ARE EVEN GUARANTEEING SUFFICIENT WAGE INCREASES THAT ACCOUNT FOR INFLATION OR THE COST OF LIVING FOR WORKERS. WHO MAINTAIN THESE FACILITIES? BUT IT SEEMS LIKE MOST YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WE CAN'T JUST TAKE IN MORE STUDENTS WITHOUT ADDING MORE RESOURCES. BUT TO ADDRESS WHAT. ASSEMBLYMAN MCCARTY SAID EARLIER IS THAT I IN THE IN THE WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE OF WASTE. YES THERE PROBABLY IS WASTE YES PROBABLY YOU CO P. COULD SPEND MONEY BETTER ARE YOU KNOW I STUDENTS WE SAW THE AUDIT. AND WE WERE DISAPPOINTED BUT AT THE SAME TIME EVERY PUBLIC SYSTEM HAS A DEGREE OF WASTE AND AS HOT POTATO IS PLAYED BACK AND FORTH. BETWEEN. BIFF BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE U. COPD. STUDENTS ARE THE ONES WHO ARE ACTUALLY SUFFERING AND I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THAT. AS SOMEONE WHO WORKS CLOSELY WITH TRANSFER STUDENTS WORKING IN A STUDENT GOVERNMENT OFFICE THE ADVOCATES. FOR TRANSFERS THAT THE UC APPEAL LEVEL AT THIS AT THE STATE LEVEL ON AND AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL WE CAN JUST TAKEN MORE STUDENTS WHO ARE DISADVANTAGED WHO ARE OF LOWER INCOME WITHOUT FUNDING THE SYSTEM FURTHER. AND SO I'M JUST HONESTLY REALLY TIRED AND I HOPE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS MEANS ALL OF US AND THAT YOU'VE. FUNNY YOU SEE NOT JUST FULLY FUND LIKENESS MCCARTY SAID ON BUT ACTUALLY FIND WHAT YOU SEE ESSAY IS PROPOSING. I'M AS AN INDEPENDENT STUDENT ORGANIZATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. AGAIN ONE ONE MINUTE PLEASE. MY NAME IS JENNIFER BRYCE AND I'M AN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT AT UCLA. I GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL OR LESS THAN THIRTY PERCENT OF MY CLASS CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION AT A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY BEFORE COLLEGE MY SMALL NEIGHBORHOOD WAS ALL I HAD TO MEASURE MYSELF AGAINST THE WORLD. HOWEVER MY EASY EDUCATION HAS GIVEN ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN FROM EXPERTS AND TO CONDUCT RESEARCH AYE UCLA HERE IN SACRAMENTO NMTC. LOANS GRANTS AND SCHOLARSHIPS HAVE HELPED FINANCE MY EDUCATION I JUGGLE TWO INTERNSHIPS. AND COME FROM A FAMILY THAT IS STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET FAIR PLAYING OFF PARENT CLASS YOU GROUNDS MY MOTHER'S YOU LANDS AS WELL AS MY SISTERS UC BERKELEY LAB'S. COLLEGES TAUGHT ME TO EMBRACE UNCERTAINTY I NEVER NEW OPPORTUNITIES AND EXPERIENCES TO EXPECT EACH YEAR. BUT THE QUESTION HAVE SUFFICIENT STATE FUNDING FOR YOU SEE IS WHAT UNCERTAINTY THAT WORRIES ME. TODAY'S STUDENTS HAVE TO DEAL WITH INCREASED TUITION MUCH LARGER CLASS SIZES AND CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE I'VE HAD CLASSES WHERE STUDENTS HAVE TO SAY IN THE AISLES BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH ROOM. I GET TO CLASS EXTRA EARLY SO I KNOW I CAN GET A SEAT. I HAD TEACHERS WHO DON'T HAVE ROOM SO HOLD OFFICE HOURS WE CAN DO BETTER. WE MUST PRIORITIZE AFFORDABILITY STUDENTS ARE NOT FAULT ENSURING ACCESS YOU SEE WILL EXPAND THE POTENTIAL FOR STUDENTS FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS TO SUCCEED. THANK YOU TO THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE DECLARED YOUR SUPPORT FOR THESE THE BUDGET REQUEST. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS VICTORIA SOUTH OF ITS AND I AM A SECOND YEAR AT UCLA FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. DESPITE BEING A LIFELONG CALIFORNIA RESIDENT I HAVE COME TO LEARN IN MY TIME IT YOU SEE BUT THE MIDDLE CLASS IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED WHEN DISCUSSING THE BUDGET AND INVESTING IN HIGHER EDUCATION. I RECEIVED NO FINANCIAL AID FROM THE STATE OR YOU SEE FROM EDUCATION BUT JUST PUT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PRESSURE ON MY PARENTS TO PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS WHO HAVE GIVEN OVER FOUR DEDICATE DECADES OF THEIR LIVES TO PUBLIC SERVICE. THIS QUARTER I AM SITTING ON THE FLOOR OF A TWO HUNDRED PERSON LECTURE HALL A STORY YOU'VE HEARD FROM AT LEAST FOUR CAMPUSES JUST TODAY. I OFTEN DO MY BEST NOT TO PURCHASE TEXTBOOKS SO I CAN AVOID INCURRING EXTRA FEES AND I WORK TWELVE TO FIFTEEN HOURS A WEEK IN ADDITION TO BEING A DOUBLE MAJOR WITH A MINOR. TO TRYING TO EASE THE BURDEN ON MY FAMILY. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU SEE IN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT ARE NOT PERFECT I'VE SEEN THESE IMPERFECTIONS FIRST HAND. BUT THIS BUDGET ASK AS A SYMBOL OF HARD WORK BETWEEN STUDENTS IN THE ADMINISTRATION TO SHOW HOW THIS NEEDED MONEY WOULD BENEFIT THE STUDENTS. I WANTED TO THANK CHAIRMAN CARTY FOR CONSIDERING THESE REQUESTS AND FOR ACTUALLY CALLING ON MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO FULLY FUND YOU SEE. INVEST IN THE STUDENT WHO WILL BECOME HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS FOR AGING CALIFORNIANS INVEST IN THE STUDENT WHO IS TRYING TO ENSURE THE LONGEVITY OF THE MIDDLE CLASS. INVEST IN THE STUDENT WHO WILL ONE DAY BE SITTING IN YOUR CHAIRS. INVESTED MY PEERS AND I THINK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON JERRY MCCARTY IN MEMBERS OF BUDGET SUB TWO. OF MY NAME IS RAFI SANDS AND HAVE THE PRIVILEGE THIS YEAR OF SERVING AS THE ONLY UNDERGRADUATE MEMBER OF THE UC BOARD OF REGENTS. MY FOURTH YEAR UNDERGRADUATE FROM UCLA. AND I SPENT THE LAST YEAR WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT TO WORK TOGETHER ON A BUDGET REQUEST THAT STUDENTS CAN ACTUALLY STAND BEHIND. AS STUDENTS WE ALSO ARE SOMETIMES CHALLENGED BY THE LACK OF OVERSIGHT AT THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND I'LL SAY THAT WE ARE APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR PROACTIVE THIS ENSURING THE UNIVERSITY IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE. AT THE SAME TIME LET US BE CLEAR STUDENTS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF POLITICAL INFIGHTING BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. THIS A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET QUEST WOULD BE SPENT A HUNDRED PERCENT ON CAMPUSES AND COMING TO MUTUALLY AGREED UPON REQUEST WE HAD STUDENTS MADE SURE TO SEE THAT WHERE THIS MONEY IS SPENT IS CLEARLY AND EXPLICITLY LAID OUT. AND WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO SEE THAT FOLLOWING MY REQUEST WITH THE PRESIDENT THE UC IT PROVIDED US WITH A SPECIFIC CAMPUS BY CAMPUS BREAKDOWN OF WHERE FUNDING INCREASE WOULD BE SPENT. GOING SO FAR AS TO STATE HOW MANY FULL TIME EMPLOYEE HIRES WOULD BE HIRED ON EACH CAMPUS WE WOULD LOVE TO SHARE THIS WITH YOU IF POSSIBLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING TO US IN CONSIDERING THIS BUDGET REQUEST. GOOD AFTERNOON MICHELLE BACK WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. WOULD LIKE TO STRONGLY URGE THE COMMITTEE TO RESTORE OUR GENERAL FUND TO THE UC'S BASED BUDGETS SO THAT PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX DOLLARS CAN BE USED FOR THEIR INTENDED PURPOSE. WHICH IS TO EXPAND RESIDENCY SLOTS IN THE STATE AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER. IN THE HEARING TODAY WERE MISSING AN OPPORTUNITY TO ESTABLISH HUNDREDS OF NEW SLOTS AND. THIS WOULD GO A LONG WAY IN ADDRESSING THE PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE SHORTAGE THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING STATEWIDE THANK YOU. BARBARA GLAZER WITH CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION I TOO AM HERE TO URGE YOU TO RESTORE FUNDING TO YOU SEE THAT WAS DEDUCTED AS RESULT OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX. I FEAR THAT IF THIS MONEY IS NOT RESTORED THIS YEAR THAT THIS TREND WILL NOT BE STOPPED AND WE WILL NEVER REALIZE THE PRIMARY CARE POSITIONS AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. PHYSICIANS THAT THAT WE HOPE TO REALIZE FROM PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX SO ON BEHALF OF BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE HOSPITALS THAT TRAIN RESIDENTS WE URGE YOU RESTORE THIS FUNDING THANK YOU. OKAY WHERE MARTIN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATIONS ALSO ASKING YOU TO REJECT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO CUT UC'S BUDGET AND RESTORED WITH PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDING. ARE EIGHT NONPROFIT FREESTANDING CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS TRAIN FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PEDIATRIC RESIDENTS IN THE STATE. THEIR INELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION DOLLARS AND THE FEDERAL CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL JIMMY PROGRAM ONLY REIMBURSES THEM AT ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF THE COST OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT THEY'RE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN AND AND KEEP TRAINING. THE POSITIONS OF TOMORROW PEDIATRICIANS OF TOMORROW PROGRAMS LIKE THIS ONE IMPROPER FIFTY SIX ARE GOING TO BE CRITICAL TO MAKING SURE THAT HAPPENS. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR TO MADDEN REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER THE MAN CALLED EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT LASHER OBJECT IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WE ONCE AGAIN ASK YOUR SUPPORT IN REJECTING HIS PROPOSAL THIS YEAR. OF THE FORTY MILLION TAKE AWAY FROM THE UC'S AND REALLY RESPECT THE WISHES OF THE VOTERS OF PROP FIFTY SIX WHICH IS TO USE THOSE FUNDS TO INCREASE RESIDENCY SLOTS. FOR NOT ONLY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS BUT FOR EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS AS WELL. I KNOW THE LA ALL MENTIONED. SOME DISCUSSIONS AROUND THE SONG BROWN PROGRAM BUT I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE SONG BROWN PROGRAM IS ONLY FOR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS. SO IF THERE IS SOME CONTEMPLATION OF INVOLVEMENT IN THAT I WE WOULD JUST ASK TO BE GOD KEEP US IN MIND FOR THAT. ON THE UC'S DID TALK ABOUT A PROPOSAL WHERE THEY WILL LOOK AT WORKING WITH AN OUTSIDE ENTITY POSSIBLY THE CMA FOUNDATION. WE'RE OPEN TO THAT IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM AND WE PROCEED OR INCLUSION IN THAT BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WE NEED TO RESTORE THE FORTY MILLION FURS. THANK YOU THANKS EVERYBODY FOR THEIR PUBLIC TESTIMONY WITH THAT WE WILL ADJOURN
