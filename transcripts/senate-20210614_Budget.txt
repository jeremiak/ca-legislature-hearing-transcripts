ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A QUORUM SO. WE ARE MEETING TODAY TO TAKE UP THE BUDGET BILL THE PRIMARY BUDGET BILL AB ONE TWENTY EIGHT AND AS WE ALL KNOW OUR CONSTITUTIONAL DEADLINE FOR PASSING A BUDGET IS JUNE FIFTEENTH SO OUR COMMITTEE ACTION WILL THEN ALLOW IT TO GO TO THE FLOOR. THIS BUDGET BILL THAT WE ARE TAKING UP. REPRESENTS A BUDGET PLAN THAT INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE POINT FOUR BILLION IN TOTAL SPENDING A HUNDRED NINETY FIVE BILLION OF WHICH IS IN GENERAL POINT ONE NINETY FIVE POINT FIVE. THAT IS ALMOST A THIRTY BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN GENERAL FUND SPENDING OVER THE REVISED CURRENT YEAR LEVEL. THE BUDGET BILL ALSO REFLECTS AN ALLOCATION OF TWENTY FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION IN TOTAL RESERVES. IT PAYS OFF OUR EDUCATION DEFERRALS AND MAKES OTHER PAYMENTS TO DRAWDOWN- PAY DOWN ON STATE DEBTS AND LIABILITIES TO HELP US IN THE FUTURE IF WE HAVE LESS REVENUES WHICH CAN INEVITABLY HAPPEN. BUT WITH THOSE WITH PAYING OFF A GOOD AMOUNT OF DEBT. AND BUILDING UP THE RESERVES IT WILL GREATLY ASSIST US. THEY GIVE US GOOD CHRISTIAN. NOW COMPONENTS OF THIS BUDGET BILL WERE DISCUSSED AND VETTED DURING THE SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS. AND THE FRAMEWORK WAS DISCUSSED IN OUR FULL COMMITTEE HEARING. PAST THE FRAMEWORK ROUTINES AND BUILDS ON MANY OF THE PROPOSALS THAT WE RECEIVED FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR THE MAY REVISE. BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES VERY IMPORTANT LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. AND SOME OF THE CRITICAL INVESTMENTS THAT ARE CONTAINED WITHIN THIS BUDGET BILL WE'RE TAKING UP TODAY. ARE ADDITIONAL AND THESE REFLECT BOTH ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES ADDITIONAL GRANTS FOR OUR SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED ECONOMICALLY BY THE PANDEMIC. EIGHT EXPANSION OF CHILD CARE AND THE INCREASE IN THE RATE FOR OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND I THINK ALL OF US HAVE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS PANDEMIC SAW SO MANY WOMEN. MANY MORE WOMEN THAN MEN LEAVE THE WORKPLACE BECAUSE THERE WAS DURING THE PANDEMIC NO ONE TO CARE FOR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS WHETHER IT WAS CHILDREN. OR ELDERLY FOLKS OR DISABLED FOLKS THAT WERE DEPENDENT ON THEM SO WHEN THE SHUTDOWN OCCURRED AND WE CAN'T BRING PEOPLE TO BE CARED FOR HOW THEY OTHERWISE WERE THEN WHAT HAPPENS ATTENTION THIS SOCIETY TO FALL THEN ON THE WOMAN IN THE HOUSEHOLD AND SO WE SAW MANY MORE WOMEN LEAVE THEIR JOBS. AND UNLESS WE CAN RESTORE FULL CARE FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE NEED THAT CARE WHETHER IT'S CHILDREN OR SENIORS OR DISABLED FOLKS IN WOMEN CANNOT GO BACK TO THE WORKPLACE IN THE ESTIMATES OF THE IMPACT OF THIS PANDEMIC ARE BRINGING BACK WOMEN ECONOMICALLY BACK TO THE SEVENTIES AND FOR ONE I FOR ONE HAVING BECOME A ADULT IN THE SEVENTIES I DON'T RETURN TO THAT ECONOMIC STATUS SO. THESE ASPECTS OF THE PARTS OF OUR BUDGET THAT CAN RESTORE FUNDING THAT ARE DISABLED FOLKS ARE DEPENDENT ON AND BRING BACK OUR CHILDCARE AND EXPAND OUR CHILDCARE AND TRANSITION INTO T. K. ALL OF THOSE ARE ESSENTIAL NOT ONLY JUST FOR THE HEALTH OF THE ENTIRE ECONOMY IN THE SOCIETY BUT CERTAINLY. FOR THE HEALTH OF WOMEN AND FAMILIES. ON THE OTHER- REALLY GREAT NEWS ABOUT THIS BUDGET IS THAT WE WILL HAVE ACHIEVED PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING THAT IS FUNDING FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES AT NINETY SIX POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS. NINETY SIX POINT ONE BILLION. WE ALSO HAVE AN UNPRECEDENTED EXPANSION AND FINANCIAL AID WHICH WE KNOW IS ALSO SO NEEDED WHEN WE LOOK AT THE LEVEL OF STUDENT DEBT. THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE CARRYING. WE WANT TO TRY TO AVOID THAT WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL GET THE HIGHER ED THEY FEEL IT'S NECESSARY WITHOUT HAVING TO GO INTO CRIPPLING DEBT. THE OTHER. THING WE ALL SHOULD BE VERY PROUD ABOUT IN THIS BUDGET BILL. IS MULTI YEAR FUNDING TO DEAL WITH OUR UNSHELTERED PEOPLE. THOSE WHO ARE LIVING IN ENCAMPMENTS IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES THAT ALL OF US KNOW. NO REASON IN THE RICHEST STATE IN THE RICHEST ECONOMY OUR NATION IN THE WORLD THAT WE WOULD HAVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO LIVE ON OUR STREETS. AND SO WE ARE GOING TO DO OUR BEST. TO A THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT EVEN THIS LEVEL OF FUNDING IN FACT NOT EVEN A GUARANTEE THIS LEVEL OF FUNDING CAN'T. ALLEVIATE OR AMELIORATE ALL OF IT BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR BEST BEST EFFORT AT. PROVIDING A ROOF OVER THE HEADS OF MANY MANY MORE PEOPLE THAN WHO ARE UNSHELTERED TODAY. WE'VE ALSO EXPANDED MEDI CAL. FOUR BEDROOM CALIFORNIA FIFTEEN OVER REGARDLESS OF THEIR STATUS BECAUSE IT'S THE APPROPRIATE THING TO DO. THERE'S ALSO GOOD FUNDING FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCY BUT AS I DROVE HERE THIS MORNING I HEARD ABOUT THE WE KNOW WE'RE IN A RECORD DROUGHT WE KNOW HOW DRY IT IS BUT WHAT WAS I LISTENING TO IN THE NEWS THIS MORNING ABOUT THE BIOLOGISTS WERE MEASURING. THE MOISTURE LEVEL OF ALL OF THE PLANTS. TREES SHRUBS- BRUSH ALL THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW CAN CONTRIBUTE TO OUR WILDFIRES. AND WHAT THE REPORT I HEARD IS THEY HAVE NEVER EVER SEEN. THE VEGETATION CALIFORNIA AT THIS LEVEL OF DRYNESS. SO HOW CLIMATE RESILIENCY WATER IN DROUGHT AND WILDFIRE THOSE ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT PACKAGES IN THIS BUDGET AND THEY ARE IN THIS BUDGET AND WE HAVE A COMMITMENT TO THEM. THERE'S ALSO FUNDING FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOR TRANSPORTATION WE KNOW THAT OUR TRANSIT AGENCIES WERE SEVERELY IMPACTED WE KNOW OUR WHOLE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE ALWAYS. IS BENNETT WILL BENEFIT FROM INFUSIONS OF GOOD INVESTMENT WHICH WE HAVE HERE THERE'S SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. AND GOOD INVESTMENTS IN ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND SO MUCH MORE. SO I THINK WE SHOULD ALL FEEL VERY VERY PROUD THERE'S STILL A LOT OF WORK TO DO IN REGARDS TO MEETING THE RESOURCE NEEDS TO ADDRESS. MANY OF OUR STATE'S PRESSING NEEDS AND RESIDENTS NEEDS THIS IS NOT A THIS IS THE BEST BUDGET I HAVE EVER BEEN ABLE TO BE PART OF IN ALL THE YEARS I AM IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND YET WE WILL STILL HAVE YOU WILL NOT SOLVE EVERYTHING BUT WE CAN FEEL GOOD THAT WE ARE DIRECTING FUNDING TO PLACES THAT NEED IT SO MUCH. AND THAT WE ELIMINATED THE TRIGGER CUTS THAT WERE MADE TO MANY OF OUR SAFETY NET SERVICES AND TO OUR HIGHER ED AND OTHER THINGS WHEN WE WHEN THE PERCEPTION LAST YEAR WAS THAT WE WOULD BE FACING A HORRIBLE DEFICIT. WE ARE NOT FACING HORRIBLE DEFICIT THANK GOODNESS AND WE HAVE REMOVED THOSE TRIGGER CUTS. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO AFTER WE PASS THIS. REACHING AN AGREEMENT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION VERY SOON THE LEGISLATURE IS CLEAR AND IT IS BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE THAT WILL BE ACTING ON THIS BUDGET. SO WE WILL HAVE SOME GREAT CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. AND WE WILL GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE HAVE A BUDGET THAT EVERYONE. WHAT FEEL GOOD ABOUT. NOW AFTER HEARING THE BILL WE WILL HAVE A PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD AND I WILL BE ASKING THE- POWER AND- PHONE MODERATOR TO FILL ME IN ON WHAT THE QUEUE IS SO I CAN DETERMINE THE TIME PERIOD. BUT IT'LL BE SOME TIME WE'LL WE'LL HAVE THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD BETWEEN THIRTY THIRTY MINUTES OR FORTY FIVE DEPENDING ON WHAT THE Q. AS WE MAY BE ABLE TO GIVE IT A LITTLE MORE TIME DEPENDING ON HOW LONG OUR DISCUSSION IS BUT FOR THE MOMENT. WILL THAT. TRYING TO PUT IT IN A CONSTRAINT SINCE WE DO HAVE FLOOR STASH. POOR SORRY FOR SESSION TWO DAY. NOW LET ME SEE IF OUR VICE CHAIR HAS SOME COMMENTS THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST SOME PRACTICING REMARKS. THIS IS A FAKE BUDGET. IT'S A FEEL GOOD BUT YOU GET IT LET US GET PAID BUDGET BUT WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON IS NOT GOING TO BE THE BUDGET. NOW I UNDERSTAND WE'RE UP TO MAYBE NINETY TRAILER BILLS. BILLS FOR THE PURPOSE OF. IMPLEMENTING THE PROVISIONS IN THE BUDGET. THEY ARE NOT FOR MAJOR POLICY CHANGES BUT OVER MANY YEARS WE'VE GOTTEN IN THE HABIT GOVERNORS AND LEGISLATORS OF PUTTING MAJOR POLICY. THIS BUDGET CREATES A BUNCH OF NEW AGENCIES EVEN. AT NOW THOSE ARE GOING TO BE BASE BUILDING THOSE BUDGETS ARE NEVER GOING TO GET LESS FOR THESE QUOTE NEW AGENCIES THEY'RE GONNA DO ALL THESE WONDERFUL THINGS. BUT WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE VOTING ON TODAY. YEAH WE'RE WE'RE PUTTING UP A BUDGET WELL SURE THAT DOESN'T PASS MUSTER YEAH I SUPPOSE IT DOES BUT IT'S KIND OF A FRAUD ON THE PEOPLE TO MAKE THEM THINK- LOOK AT ALL THESE WONDERFUL THINGS WERE GETTING. YEAH THIS YEAR WE HAVE ACCRUED EXTRA REVENUES. THAT'S WONDERFUL. AND AS WE DO THAT WE SHOULD BE PRUDENT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE SPEND THOSE ON. TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY. TO RETIRE DEBT. AND WE'RE NOT DOING VERY MUCH A DEBT RETIREMENT HERE. IN ONE PARTICULAR PART THAT I CONSIDER OFFENSIVE. EDT THE MOST I AGREE JUST AGENCY ALMOST IN HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA. HOW MANY OF OUR CITIZENS HAVE BEEN AGREED BY THAT AGENCY'S REMISS. IN INEFFICIENCY AND INCOMPETENCE OVER YEARS. WHAT WE'RE GONNA HELP THE BUSINESSES OUT. A LITTLE BIT. BUT OVER A DECADE GEE THAT'S REALLY GREAT. THEY NEED HELP NOW WHY DO WE HAVE TO DEFER THE IMPACT ON THEM AND THE CITIZENS THAT WE REPRESENT WHO HAVE BEEN HARMED BY THAT AGENCY. HOPEFULLY BIPARTISAN WAY MEMBERS ARE WORKING TOGETHER. TO HAVE SOME DRASTIC CHANGES. IN THE CONDUCT OF EDT. THIS LEGISLATURE DARE NOT ADJOURN WITHOUT DRASTICALLY CHANGING STATUTORY. THE MISSION AND CONDUCT OF THAT AGENCY. WE'RE NOT DOING THAT HERE. AND I WOULD RATHER SEE THAT BE DONE HERE. BUT WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE IMPLEMENTING SO CALLED TRAILER BILLS. ARE GOING TO HOLD FOR US WHENEVER WE GET AROUND TO DOING THAT. AND REMEMBER WE COULD STILL BE DOING TRAILER BILLS NEXT YEAR. IMPLEMENTING THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BUDGET I WOULD ARGUE MEMBERS TO. THOUGH THERE'S A LOT OF REVENUE HERE THE STROLL AROUND. A LOT OF THINGS THAT COULD BE FUNDED. BUT SOME THINGS ARE HUGE ONGOING OBLIGATIONS AFFECTING FUTURE BUDGETS. IMPACTING FUTURE DEFICITS. DO NOT FORGET WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE DAVIS ADMINISTRATION. THE DAVIS ADMINISTRATION CAME IN WITH A BIG SURPLUS. AND BOY DID EVERYBODY SPEND EVEN REPUBLICANS GOT THEIR PIECE OF THE ACTION. WITH SOME GIVE BACK THE VOTERS. BUT WHAT THEN HAPPENED. WE CONCRETIONS THE BASE BUDGET. I BELIEVE WAS TWO YEARS LATER WITH CROWD CROWDED AWAY INTO TWENTY FOUR BILLION DEFICIT AND THEN A FORTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT. I PREDICT THAT THAT'S WHERE THIS BUDGET IS HEADED. TWO TO FOUR YEARS OUT HUGE DEFICITS BECAUSE OF THE BUILT IN AUTOMATIC OBLIGATIONS THAT WE'RE FINDING HERE. AND WHAT ARE THE SHEET TO THE MOTORING PUBLIC TO. WE HAD TO RAISE THE GAS TAX WE HAD IN THE EXIT. THE NDP'S EVERYTHING HAD TO BE. INCREASED AND INDEXED. WELL WHEN WE GET THE TAXPAYERS A LITTLE BREAK THE MOTORING PUBLIC A LITTLE BREAK AND REDUCE THEIR BUT- BIRDS SOMEONE AGAIN I WOULD ARGUE THAT THIS IS WORTHY OF A NO VOTE AND WE'LL CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSION AND HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS MADAM CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR CLEARLY- EVERYONE ON OUR IN OUR COMMITTEE AND IN OUR HOUSES IN TOTAL THERE OPINIONS. I WOULD SAY THAT THE TERM FEEL GOOD OBVIOUSLY CAN HAVE DIFFERENT MEANINGS. I WILL TAKE FEEL GOOD ABOUT THIS BUDGET AS A POSITIVE BECAUSE I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THIS PROJECT. AND THIS IS NOT A FIXED BUDGET WHILE THERE COULD BE OBVIOUSLY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHETHER IT ADEQUATELY PAYS OFF DEBTS. OR WHETHER IT CREATES- FUTURE- COSTS THAT. MAY THEN HAVE TO BE MODIFIED IF WE DO FACING ECONOMIC CURRENT DOWNTURN. WE WILL FACE THAT BUT CERTAINLY IF WE TAKE FOR EXAMPLE INVESTMENTS IN CHILD CARE TO NOT INVEST NOW BECAUSE WE FEAR THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME REDUCTION IN REVENUES IN THREE TO FOUR YEARS WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON THAT ZERO TO THREE CHILD. THAT THEY DO NOT GET THE QUALITY CARE AND EDUCATION THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO THRIVE AND ALLOW OUR ECONOMY TO THRIVE LATER BECAUSE THEY HAVE THRIVED. YOU CAN'T GET THAT BACK SO I WOULD PREFER TO. DO ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR THOSE BASIC NEEDS AND- AND IF WHEN WE FACE SOME REVENUE DROPS WHICH ARE INEVITABLE WE KNOWS ECONOMICS CYCLES WE HAVE QUESTIONS. THERE'S NOTHING FAKE ABOUT THIS BUDGET THERE IS QUESTION. AND IF. HORRENDOUSLY WE FACE SOMETHING LIKE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WE ADOPTED TODAY EVEN IF WE PUT TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WE HOPE WILL NEVER EVER BE REPEATED. BACK TO PLAN SOLELY FOR THAT TYPE OF A- A BUDGET CURRENTS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE OF THE HARM THAT WE COULD CAUSE NOW. IN TRYING TO IMAGINE PREVENTING HARM OF THE FUTURE LET US DO OUR BEST TO NOT CREATE HARM NOW. AND THAT IS WHAT I FEEL THIS BUDGET DOES AND IT IS PRUDENT. AND IT IS NOT FAKE. AND WITH THAT WE WILL START. HERE FROM OUR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST MR PADDOCK WHO WILL PRESENT- I'M SORRY APOLOGIES PLEASE MY PHONE I AM VERY SORRY I'M SORRY. ED CENTER LAYERED STRAHAN WAS UP FIRST. CENTERMAN GO AHEAD DO IT. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF IN OUR SENATE LEADERSHIP- INCLUDING YOU OUR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRS- AND OUR STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK GOING THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE I ALSO FEEL GOOD ABOUT THIS BUDGET AND IT'S A HISTORIC BUDGET THANKS TO RESPONSIBLE BUDGETING LAST DECADE STRONG STIMULUS FAMILY PAYMENTS THAT KEPT STRUGGLING FAMILIES AFLOAT AND PREVENT A COMPLETE ECONOMIC COLLAPSE DURING THE CALL BUT NINETEEN PANDEMICS. AND ALSO BECAUSE OF LONG RUN INVESTMENTS THAT CREATED THE UNIQUE CONDITIONS HERE IN THE STATE FOR SUSTAINED GROWTH NEARLY 40% OF JOBS CREATED THIS YEAR HAVE COME FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE UNIQUELY STRONGLY POSITIONED RIGHT NOW IS AN ECONOMY AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE'VE MADE STRONG INVESTMENTS IN THINGS LIKE EDUCATION AND SMALL BUSINESSES AND I'M PROUD TO SEE THAT THIS BUDGET DOES A LOT OF THAT GOING FORWARD AND I WANT TO PARTICULARLY THANK AND APPLAUD THE CHAIR OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE I SIT ON SENATOR LAYERED- WHO'S BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN FURTHERING HISTORIC INVESTMENTS. IN E. C. E. K. TWELVE AND HIGHER ED AND HIS ROLE AS SUB ONE CHAIR- THESE INVESTMENTS IN EDUCATION ARE GOING TO BE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL FOR SUSTAINED ECONOMIC PROSPERITY GOING FORWARD- WE HAVE TO BE NOT THE OPPOSITE OF PENNYWISE POUND FOOLISH- WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM EDUCATES OUR YOUNG PEOPLE EDUCATES OUR COLLEGE STUDENTS CREATES COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY SO THAT THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE WILL GROW UP AND BECOME THE BASIS OF A STRONG ECONOMY GOING FORWARD. I'M ALSO PROUD THAT THIS BUDGET INCLUDES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE OFICE OF RACIAL EQUITY AND API LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS PRIORITY AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS ADVANCING RACIAL EQUITY IN STATE GOVERNMENT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS MORE TOWARDS THIS CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS COBRE NINETEEN RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM WHICH HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY FUNDED THREE SP EIGHTY SEVEN AUTHORED BY SENATOR CAFIERO AND MYSELF- TWENTY TWO HUNDRED MILLION TOWARDS PREVENTING GUN VIOLENCE IN THE STATE AND FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT DOMESTIC AND- VIOLENCE PREVENTION. AMONG OTHERS THESE TYPES OF HISTORIC INVESTMENTS ARE NOT ONLY FEEL GOOD NOW THEY AGAIN WILL HAVE LONG RUN EFFECTS THAT WILL CREATE THE CONDITIONS FOR SUSTAINED ECONOMIC PROSPERITY IN THE LONG RUN. I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THROUGH FURTHER DISCUSSION I HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE IMPROVING THIS BUDGET- AND ADDRESSING OTHER LONG RUN PRIORITIES INCLUDING CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE CRISIS THAT WE'RE NOW FACING I WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE INVESTMENT IN THE RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAN HELP US REALLY TRY TO MEET DEMAND IMPATIENCE MANDATES THAT OUR STATE IS SET AND CONTINUE TAKING THAT STRONG LEADERSHIP ROLE IN SAVING OUR CIVILIZATION FROM THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY THAT WE'RE NOW FACING. IN TERMS OF EDUCATION I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN SYSTEM WE END UP ADOPTING IS FAVORABLE TO ALL PARTIES IS DONE WITH THE SUSTAINABLE FRAMEWORK AND IS NOT DETRIMENTALLY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY OR COST OF CHILD CARE TO PEOPLE IN THE STATE. WHILE THESE ITEMS ARE NOT CURRENTLY IN THIS BUDGET I LOOK FORWARD TO MAKING SURE THEY ARE INCLUDED AS WE FINALIZE OUR NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNOR- I WANNA FINALLY JUST SAY. WE HAVE A STRONG ECONOMY RIGHT NOW BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE STRUGGLING. THEY'RE PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT AND ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS THAT ARE STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW- AND WHEN WE WELL WE SEE THAT THE FUTURE OF OUR ECONOMY IS BRIGHT- THAT DOES NOT MEAN A LOT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE BARELY GETTING BY RIGHT NOW AND SO- I. AM VERY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT YOU WE ALL HAVE DONE IN TRYING TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE NOW. WHILE BALANCING THAT WITH THE LONG RUN PRIOR TO THE STATE I WANT TO THANK LEADERSHIP AGAIN AND EVERYONE-INVOLVED IN THIS BUDGET FOR THESE HISTORIC STATE INVESTMENTS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING THIS BUDGET TODAY. SENATOR LAYERED. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE- THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE BUDGET WAS ADDRESSED IT IN THE LIGHT OF COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE COMPARING THIS TO THE SITUATION OF TWENTY YEARS AGO. BECAUSE I ARRIVED IN THE LEGISLATURE EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO THE DEFICIT WAS ROUGHLY TEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR UNTIL THE GREAT RECESSION IT WAS BECAUSE TAXES WERE CAUGHT THERE WAS NO RESEARCH AND SO NOW. ARE YOU WHAT DIDN'T GET MENTIONED IS THAT N. SEVENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF EXTRA STATE MONEY WE HAVE A TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR ROUTE IN TOTAL RESERVES TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THAT DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE AND THAT REALLY IS DESIGNED TO EVEN OUT THE BOOM AND BUST OF THE BUDGETS WE HAVE A I THINK THE NUMBERS ELEVEN BILLION IS IN STIMULUS IT'S A ONE TIME AND IT GOES TO THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING THE MOST IN THIS PERIOD OF TIME. AND SO THAT REALLY ARE TRIES TO EVEN OUT TO WHERE WE ARE IN THE ECONOMY THIS BUDGET DOES PAY OFF DEBTS YEAH THE DEFERRALS THAT EXISTED WERE FOR EDUCATION WE'RE NOT EVEN PROPOSED TO BE COMPLETELY PAID OFF IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET THIS BUDGET DOES IT SO THAT THE- INTERESTED TWO CREWED BY LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL NOT BE APPROVED THE DEFERRAL WAS PAID OFF AND THEN THERE ARE DISH NO ONE TIME EXPENDITURES ONE FOUR BILLION DOLLARS FOR. HIGHER EDUCATION BUILDING CONSTRUCTION OTHERWISE WE WOULD BE ASKED TO DO A BOND WE WOULD BE ASKED TO PAY MAYBE A DOLLAR EIGHTY CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT WENT TO BUILDING CONSTRUCTION INSTEAD OF PUTTING AN END TO A BOND AND INCURRING THAT DEBT WE'RE DOING A ONE TIME EXPENDITURE FOR THE FOUR BILLION DOLLARS WE'RE RECOMMENDING IN THIS BUDGET. SO AND THEN IF YOU LOOK AT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE INCREASED. ON GROWING REVENUES WE IN DRESS IMPACT THOSE ISSUES THAT WERE MENTIONED BY THE CHAIR. WHETHER IT'S HOMELESSNESS CHILD CARE SLOTS HEALTH CARE- A DEBT FREE COLLEGE PRESCHOOL AND SO THIS IS A VERY SOUND BUDGET THAT. WITH ONGOING REVENUES ADDRESSES WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR IMPACT AND IS REALLY SOUND WITH A LARGE AMOUNT OF RESERVES A LARGE AMOUNT OF ONE TIME MONEY GOING TO THE PEOPLE THAT NEED IT. A LARGE AMOUNT ONE TIME MONEY AVERTING THE NEED FOR BONDS A LARGE AMOUNT OF ONE TIME MONEY PAYING OFF DEBT. THIS IS SOUND FISCAL WAY AND I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE THOSE POINTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYER DOES WERE VERY IMPORTANT POINTS IN YOUR- I'M SURE YOU. COULD HAVE ALSO INCLUDED THE FACT THAT NOT ONLY ARE WE NOT DOING A BLIND FOR THAT NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE AT OUR HIGHER EDUCATION WHICH OF COURSE. CREATES DEBT WE ARE INVESTING IN IT DIRECTLY WE'RE ALSO DOING SIMILARLY FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCY. AND SO WE ARE ADDRESSING WITH THE REVENUES WE HAVE NOW. THOUGH CLIMATE RESILIENCY AND IN THE FUTURE YES WE MAY HAVE TO SOME POINT WELL WELL INTO THE FUTURE CONSIDER A BOND BUT AT THIS POINT WE'RE NOT HAVING TO DO THAT AND BY NOT DOING IT WE ARE NOT CREATING DEBT AS YOU POINTED OUT. AND I'M SURE WHEN THE LA- PRESENTS. THEY WILL POINT OUT. THAT THIS BUDGET. IS STRUCK. DOWN THROUGH THE NEXT FOUR FISCAL YEARS SO WHEN I REFERRED. THAT OCCURS WE KNOW THE ECONOMY IS IT HAPPENS. FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS THERE IS NO PROJECTED OUT YEAR DEFICITS. SO IN THAT RESPECT I WAS VERY ACCURATE IN THIS NOT BEING A FAKE BY CHECK. AND LET ME CALL ON SENATOR EKMAN. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER YES SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST LIKE TO MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS ON. WE'RE DEBATING OVER A BUDGET THAT HAS. A LOT OF MONEY IN IT AND I THINK IT'S- THERE ARE SOME PRUDENT THINGS IN HERE ABOUT PAYING ONE TIME DEBTS. BUT WHAT I WANT TO COMMENT ON IS WHAT ARE THE DELIVERABLES TO ME IT'S NOT. SO MUCH ABOUT THE MONEY IT'S ABOUT THE POLICY OF HOW WE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. A FEW YEARS BACK WE WORKED ON. THE WATER BORNE INTO MANY MEMBERS IN HERE WE WORKED REALLY HARD TO PASS A BOND. THAT WOULD. CREATE MORE WATER. IT WAS A DIFFICULT BATTLE WE WENT BACK AND FORTH WE TALKED ABOUT STORAGE. AND HERE WE ARE. SIX YEARS LATER AND WE HAVEN'T. CREATED ONE GALLON OF WATER STORAGE AND WE'RE IN A DROUGHT. SO WE HAVE BROADBAND SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THIS BUDGET. OVER A PERIOD OF TIME THERE'S COUNTLESS BILLS MOVING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. BUT WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A PLAN ON EXACTLY HOW THAT'S GOING TO WORK. AND SO I PROPOSE THAT. ON THE- THE WATER THE MONEY GOING FOR. YOU COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICTS AND HOW WE NEED DETAILS WE NEED DETAIL OF HOW THAT'S GOING TO. PLAY OUT AND HOW IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE THE DELIVERABLES ON THE GROUND WITH THE SAME THING WITH BROADBAND. LOOK WE HAVE ALL THESE BILLS WE NEED. A COMMITTEE TO SIT DOWN WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE TRYING TO GET SOMEWHERE AND ACTUALLY PUT A POLICY IN PLACE THAT DELIVERS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH I THINK. THE PERSPIRATION FOR ME MORE THAN ANYTHING IS THAT IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY GOVERNMENT ALWAYS THROWS MORE MONEY AT IT BUT THE POLICY. IS THE PROBLEM. SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE THIS BUDGET COMMITTEE TO REALLY LOOK AT THE POLICY AND WHAT IS THE DELIVERABLE AT THE END OF ALL THIS. HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE'RE GONNA BE PUSHING OUT MORE MONEY THAN WE'VE EVER PUSHED OUT INTO A BUDGET BUT HOW IS IT REALLY GOING TO AFFECT THE PERSON THAT'S IN THE INNER CITY THAT'S IN A HOUSING PROJECT FOR THE BROADBAND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW. I WANT TO KNOW ARE WE REALLY GONNA DELIVER. ARE WE GONNA DELIVER WATER BUT WE GET IT WE DID SOME EARLY ACTION ITEMS FOR THE FIRE WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO IT'S AS THIS IS THE CHAIRMAN STATED. IT'S GONNA BURN IT'S THE MOISTURE IS BEING SUCKED OUT EVERY DAY I HAVE NEVER SEEN WIND. LIKE THIS IN THIS EARLY IN THE YEAR- ON OUR FARM AND SO THAT'S TAKING MOISTURE OUT OF OUR PLANTS. SO WE DID SOME EARLY ACTION IS BUT FOR ME VENTURE MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON. THE POLICY IT ACTUALLY. SPENDS THIS MONEY AND HOW IT'S GOING TO. BECOME DELIVERABLES TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY NEED IT AND THAT INCLUDES BUSINESSES WITH THEIR ET DE PAY BACKS OVER TIME THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON AND I KNOW. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE. NINETY SOME TRAILER BILLS AND THAT'S WHAT THE POLICY IS REALLY GOING TO BE. THIS IS THE OVERALL BUDGET. IT SETS THE AMOUNT WHICH IS. HUGE BUT WE REALLY NEED GOOD POLICY IF WE'RE GONNA DO THE RIGHT THING BY CALIFORNIANS IN THIS ONE TIME OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE TO GET IT TO THE GROUND AND IT HAS TO WORK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SO LET'S HEAR FROM LMAO AND THEN WE WILL HAVE A LITTLE MORE CONTENT BEFORE ASSISTIR WHAT WE ARE. ACTING ON TODAY SO MR PADDOCK WILL YOU PLEASE BEGIN THE PRESENTATION OF A B. ONE TWENTY EIGHT AND- YOU JUST- GO AHEAD. OKAY VERY GOOD THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR- THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME- MR VICE CHAIR AND SENATORS- MY NAME IS GABE PADDOCK AND LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AND- I'M JOINED TODAY BY SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ONLINE AS WELL TO- RESPOND ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE AFTERWARDS- TODAY I WOULD HAVE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A BREF. OVERVIEW OF THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE. AND SO HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE A COPY OF THIS- SHORT TWO PAGE HANDOUT THAT I- CIRCULATED. THAT WE PROVIDED- SO I'LL BEGIN WITH THAT- ON THE FIRST PAGE OF IT- AND AS THE CHAIR. MENTIONED THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX BILLION IN GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES- THE PACKAGE- IT USES THE REVENUE ESTIMATES FROM OUR OFFICE. ADJUSTED FOR ADDITIONAL FINAL TAX COLLECTION IN APRIL AND MAY WHICH HAD THREE POINT NINE BILLION TO OUR REVENUE ESTIMATES. THESE FINAL TAX PAYMENTS CAME IN AFTER WE HAD CLOSED THE BOOK ON OUR BOOKS ON OUR FORECAST SO- THAT'S WHERE THE BILLS ARE COMING FROM. AND SO THEN OVERALL OUR REVENUE ESTIMATE IS ABOUT EIGHT BILLION HIGHER THAN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ESTIMATES WERE. AND IN THAT PACKAGE THIS IS AN ALMOST EXACTLY OFFSET BY THE ESTIMATED COST OF THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS TWO POINT NO PAYMENTS AND THOSE ARE SCORED IN THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE AT OUR RICK REVENUE REDUCTION. A COUPLE OF OTHER POINTS ON THIS FIRST PAGE THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGING USES AROUND SEVEN POINT THREE BILLION OF THE FEDERAL AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN FUNDS TO OFFSET GENERAL FUND COSTS AND IN ADDITION TO THAT. THE PACKAGE AS SOON AS THE- HIGHER FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES AND USES THE ENTIRE- FEDERAL FUNDS TO PAY FOR THE IT CBS AUGMENTATIONS AS REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL. GUIDELINES AND THEN LASTLY ON THIS STAGE BUT IT'S MENTIONED- THE RESERVES THAT THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE DOES HAVE A TOTAL OF TWENTY POINT THREE BILLION IN RESERVES NOT INCLUDING THE FIVE POINT THREE BILLION AND- PROP NINETY EIGHT RESERVE- AND THEN- WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE LEGISLATIVE. PACKAGE DOES ALLOCATE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION TO INCREASE THE SAFETY NET RESERVE BRINGING THE BALANCE IN THAT DISCRETIONARY RESERVE TO ONE POINT TWO BILLION. OKAY MOVING TO THE SECOND PAGE I WILL JUST- COVER A FEW OF THE MAJOR CHOICES THAT ARE MADE IN THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE. FIRST AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED ALREADY- THE PACKAGE PROVIDES A TOTAL OF NINETY SIX BILLION FOR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. OF THIS SIXTY NINE BILLION IS FROM THE GENERAL FUND. AND IT DOES INCLUDE SUBSTANTIAL ALLOCATION TO ONE TIME ACTIVITIES WHICH HAS OUR OFFICE HAS DESCRIBED BEFORE DOES CREATE UPROOTING QUESTION IN THE EVENT THAT- FUTURE- IN THE FUTURE THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE LEVEL WERE TO DECLINE. AMONG THE ONE TIME ALLOCATIONS THIS HAS ALSO BEEN MENTIONED. THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE REPLACES FIVE BILLION AND- MAY REVISION ONE TIME SPENDING WITH- TO TWO AREAS- TWO POINT SIX BILLION OF IT GOES TO PAY OFF THE REMAINING- K. THROUGH TWELVE DEFERRALS AND THEN. THE BALANCE OF THAT FIVE FIVE BILLION- IN ONE TIME FUNDING WOULD GO TO THAT. ADDRESS SOME LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES INCLUDING A HIGH SCHOOL BLOCK GRANT INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION EXPANSION. AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. WHEN IT COMES TO ONGOING SPENDING COMPARED TO THE MAY REVISION THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE HAS ABOUT TWO BILLION IN ADDITIONAL. FUNDING FOR K. FOURTEEN PROGRAMS. IN THE IN THE ON THE- WITHIN K. TWELVE EDUCATION THE LARGEST AUGMENTATIONS ARE WERE SPECIAL EDUCATION BASED FUNDING AND STATE PRESCHOOL SLOT AND RATE INCREASES. IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE LARGEST INCREASES ARE FOR A VARIETY OF CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS. AND A HIGHER- BASE OF COURSE IN MEN'S INCREASED. THEN WHEN WE MOVED TO THE NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SIDE OF THE BUDGET THE PACKAGE INCLUDES SIGNIFICANT ALLOCATIONS FOR. DROUGHT AND WILDFIRE IS THAT RESILIENCE AND RELATIVE TO THE MAY REVISION IT INCREASES OTHER- CLIMATE RELATED ACTIVITIES AND IT'S- IT'S ALSO BEEN TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT HERE- NO THE PACKAGE ALSO INCLUDES LARGE ALLOCATIONS TO- HOMELESS MISS RELATED- ACTIVITIES SUCH AS PROJECT HOME KEY. AND THE- COMPARED TO THE MAY REVISION PROVIDES A HIGHER LEVEL OF FLEXIBILITY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES FOR SERVICES TO THOSE THAT EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AND IN ADDITION WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES THE PACKAGE INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN MILLION TO FIND TO BEGIN. THE THREE YEAR PHASE IN OF THE RATE MODELS THAT WERE PROPOSED BY THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN DDS- RATE STUDY- THAT TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN MILLION IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IT'S FOR HAPPIER COST OF FEEDING IN THE RATE INCREASES. AND BY THE FINAL YEAR OF THE MULTI YEAR AND- BUT I'M SORRY APPLE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION WHICH IS- TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR- THEY WOULD AT A COST OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN MILLION. THE PACKAGE IN ADDITION. PROVIDES APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION IN ONGOING FUND AND SEVENTY MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDS TO UPDATE OR MODERNIZE. ELEMENTS OF THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. ALSO THERE IS- SIXTY SIX AND A HALF MILLION TO EXPAND ELIGIBILITY FOR FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL TO INCOME ELIGIBLE ADULTS OVER AGE FIFTY REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS AND THE COST OF THIS EXPANSION. WOULD GROW TO AROUND ONE POINT THREE BILLION UPON FULL IMPLEMENTATION- ONE EXAMPLE THAT WE WANTED TO MENTION ALSO IS THAT THE PACKAGE DOES THE INTERNET IN EXAMPLE OF- BUDGET RESILIENCE THE PACKAGE DOES INCLUDE A BILLION IN FUNDS TO PREPAY- SOME OF THE STATE FUNDED DEBT SERVICE. AND THEN FINALLY- ARTIST- AT THE MENTION BRIEFLY THAT THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE DOES INCLUDE SUBSTANTIAL AUGMENTATIONS FOR STUDENT FINANCIAL AID. INCLUDING THE PELL GRANT PROGRAM AND THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP- PROGRAM BOTH- INCLUDE EXPANDED ELIGIBILITY AND INCREASE THE WORD SIZES SO- I'LL STOP THERE AND- ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES WOULD BE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU LET'S HEAR FROM DO YOU F. FIFTY F. HAS ANY COMMENTS AND THEN WE CAN SEE IF THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS I CERTAINLY HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE LA- BUT GO AHEAD. DO YOU F. AND MORNING MADAM CHAIR- MR VICE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ACTUALLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE AGAIN- I MADE REMARKS ON THE SENATE PLAN- THAT'S NOT INCLUDED IN EIGHTY ONE TWENTY EIGHT. AT THE COMMITTEE'S LAST HEARING SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO BRIEFLY SAY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE. OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS NOW- TO COME UP WITH A FINAL BUDGET AGREEMENT THAT MAINTAINS A STRONG FISCAL FOUNDATION THAT DOESN'T OVER COMMIT THE STATE TO- LONG TERM SPENDING THAT IT CANNOT AFFORD IT WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO CUTS IN THE FUTURE TO CORE PROGRAMS- BUT IMPORTANTLY WE LOOK FORWARD TO BUILDING A BUDGET THAT. INVESTS IN AND KEEPS ALL CALIFORNIANS ON A SUSTAINABLE PATH- TOWARDS RECOVERY. AND GROWTH SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK SO. BEFORE I CALL ON- MEMBERS IN OBVIOUSLY AND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS FOR EARLY OR DO YOU UP I WILL CALLING YOU. ON MR PANIC I'M QUESTIONING YOU USE THAT LAID OUT THAT. THE LA O'S RESTAURANT REVENUE ESTIMATES R. EIGHT BILLION HIRED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES THAT WERE CONTAINED IN THE MAY REVISE AND THAT'S PARTIALLY DUE TO THE FACT OF SOME REVENUES THAT CAME IN SUBSEQUENT TO THAT. I MEAN AND- SO I- OUT WHAT I'D LIKE YOU TO ELABORATE ON IS- DID JUST MOVE THOSE REVENUES THAT CAME IN BUT ALSO. YOU THIS IS ALWAYS A BIG DEPARTMENT FINANCE OF COURSE DOES FOR CASTELLI- DOES FORECAST BUT THE LEGISLATURE HAS. RELIED ON THE LA- FOR THIS FORECAST BECAUSE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED THAT YOUR FORECASTS FORECASTS HAVE BEEN A LITTLE MORE ACCURATE THEN IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND SO IF YOU- WOULDN'T MIND COMING IN ON THAT YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY- WE- IS THAT PORTION OF THE ARCHITECTURE IS VERY IMPORTANT SO THAT. WE KNOW THAT WE ARE BEING RESPONSIBLE AS WE HAVE. DESCRIBED AND WE INTEND TO BE SIR GO AHEAD. YES OKAY THAT'S- AND IMPORTING QUESTION MADAM CHAIR- AND I WILL SAY THAT WE DID DO OUR YOU KNOW OUR LEVEL BEST TO MAKE OUR BEST GUESS ESTIMATE ON THE REVENUE THEN OF COURSE OUR REVENUES COULD JUST BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN- YOU KNOW- CLOSER TO THE ACTUAL THAN SOME RECENT YEARS THAT DOESN'T MEAN- THEY ALWAYS WILL BE BUT ACCORDING TO OUR- SCENARIO ANALYSIS. WE THINK WE'RE AT ABOUT THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE POTENTIAL OUTCOME WHICH MEANS ALTHOUGH OUR REVENUES COULD ESTIMATE COULD PROVE TO BE TOO HIGH THEY COULD ALSO PROVE TO BE TOO LOW RELATIVE TO THE ACTUAL RESULTS- ONE REASON- SEVERAL REASONS THAT WE FEEL LIKE. CONTINUATION OF RELATIVELY STRONG REVENUE GROWTH IS LIKELY REFLECTS- THAT THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS THE FIRST IS THAT- THE CONSENSUS OF ECONOISTS AT THIS TIME IS THAT THE- ECONOMY IS POISED TO GROW AT ITS FASTEST CLIP IN THE PAST FORTY YEARS- IN ADDITION NOW THE ECONOMY IS STILL EXPERIENCING CONSIDERABLE ASSISTANCE FROM- FEDERAL FISCAL IMPORTS COMING THROUGH OUR SYSTEM SO THAT'S GONNA- ADDED BOOST TO GDP GROWTH- FEDERAL RESERVE OFFICIALS HAVE EXPRESSED COMMITMENT TO AN ACCOMMODATIVE MONETARY POLICY WHICH IS REFLECTED IN THE LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS USUALLY CONDUCIVE TO ECONOMIC GROWTH. BROADLY SPEAKING. AND THEN YOU KNOW RELATED TO THAT THE FINAL POINT IS THAT AT THEIR PRICES REMAIN HIGH AND- WITH HIGH STOCK PRICES AND HOME VALUES YOU KNOW DOES GENERATE. CONSIDERABLE PERSONAL INCOME TAX REVENUES IN PARTICULAR FOR THE STATE AND SO. WELL THAT PARTICULAR ELEMENT IS PUT IS SUBJECT TO A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AT LEAST FOR THE UPCOMING BUDGET YEAR WE THINK THAT THE BEST. YES IN OUR IN OUR- WORLD VIEW IS THAT THE CONTINUED STRONG GROWTH OF REVENUES IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT- AND SO- YOU KNOW THAT THAT SPEAKS TO WHY OUR REVENUES WERE PROBABLY YOU KNOW IN THE RANGE OF FOUR BILLION HIGHER THAN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AROUND THE TIME OF THE MAY REVISION AND THEN. AS YOU MENTIONED- IN APRIL AND MAY TAX COLLECTIONS CONTINUE TO SURPASS THE EARLIER ESTIMATE AND WE'RE NOT REFLECTED IN OUR- FORECAST AND- THEREFORE YOU COULD ADD THOSE TO THE TO THE MIX IN THAT LIST THE REVENUE ESTIMATES BEST IMAGE BY. ANOTHER THREE POINT NINE BILLION SO WHEN YOU ADD THE FOUR BILLION IN THE THREE POINT NINE THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GETTING TO THE EIGHT BILLION HIGHER REVENUES. I APPRECIATE THAT EXPLANATION- ME SEE IF I HAD ANOTHER QUESTION HI YOU ALSO MENTIONED- BE A CHRISTIAN THAT WAS BUILT IN FOR OUR SCHOOLS IN RELATIONSHIP TO PROP NINETY EIGHT COULD YOU JUST ELABORATE ON THAT A LITTLE MORE. SURE YOU KNOW WE OFTEN THINK- THE BUDGET IN AND KIND OF TWO SIDES OF THE HOUSE WANTED THE NON NINETY EIGHT SIDE AND THEN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SIDE. AND SO AS A BUDGET WITHIN THE BUDGET THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT- OVERALL FUNDING LEVEL- INCLUDE THIS YEAR A SIGNIFICANT- ALLOCATION TO ONE TIME SPENDING. AND SO WITH THAT ONE TIME SPENDING- I'M SORRY IF THE IF THE GUARANTEE WERE TO GO DOWN IN A SUBSEQUENT YEAR THAT ONE TIME SPENDING WOULD NOT BE BAKED INTO THE- SCHOOL DISTRICT BUDGETS AND WOULD RESULT AND- YOU KNOW LESS- FISCAL PRESSURE FOR SCHOOLS AND- AND OVERALL PROP NINETY EIGHT- BUDGET AS A RESULT. OF THAT THE SUBSTANTIAL ALLOCATION TO ONE TIME- I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS MY COLLEAGUE EDGAR CABRAL WOULD WANT TO SUPPLEMENT WHAT I'M SAYING WITH SOME WITH SOME. YOU KNOW HELPFUL ADDITIONAL DETAILS. GREAT. ROSLYN'S GLOWING FROM WITHIN I THINK I WAS JUST NOT A GOOD DAY THE PROPOSITION NINETY RESERVE- WHAT INCREASE TO- A FIVE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE IN THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE THAT'S A REFLECTION OF THE ADDITIONAL- ROMANISM HIGHER MINIMUM GUARANTEE THAT'S- REQUIRED- UNDER UNDER THE- CONSTITUTION REQUIREMENTS OF THE RESEARCH. ARM IN ADDITION BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE IS MAKING A LARGE DEPOSIT IN THIS BUDGET IT WOULD BE A THREE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR DEPOSIT. IN THE BUDGET YEAR IN ADDITION THERE IS A VARIETY OF ONE TIME I'M SPENDING THERE IS A VERY HARD QUESTION IN THIS. IN THIS BUDGET- WHICH MEANS THAT WE'RE REVENUES TO DECLINE NEXT YEAR- THE NEED FOR REDUCTIONS OF ARMS YOU ARE I'M GOING TO TALK EXCUSE PROGRAMS WHICH WOULD BE UNLIKELY UNLESS IT WAS A VERY VERY. LARGE- WE'RE LISTENING ROOMS. GREAT THANK YOU. I AND- BEFORE I TO CALL SIZE WANT TO GET AN EXPRESS MY THANKS. TO THE LA- FOR. THE EXCELLENT WORK DID YOU THE ANNEX EXCELLENT ANALYSIS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN PROVIDING US. THAT THE LEGISLATURE BOTH HOUSES HAVE. RELIED ON A GREAT DEAL THIS YEAR IN TERMS OF STRUCTURING THIS AND WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE. THAT DOES THAT REVIEW AND ANALYSIS. SO SENATOR NIELSEN THEN SENATOR DOLLY. AND I THINK I SAW ANOTHER HAND UP BUT OFTEN SECOND GO AHEAD SENATOR NELSON- DIRECTED TO- THE ANALYST STATIC. BUT MUCH BETTER OVER THE YEARS. YOUR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS OF THE ANALYSTS HAVE BEEN FAR MORE CLOSE TO THE POINT THEN GOVERNORS. I UNDERSTAND THAT AND THAT IS REALLY NOT THE POINT THAT I'M TRYING TO DO WELL ON OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT WE PUT A LOT OF CREDIBILITY IN THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST. IT APPEARS TO ME. THAT WE'RE CONTINUING. FROM TWELVE BILLION AND SOLUTIONS FROM LAST YEAR. AND WE'VE DONE THAT. OUR CONTINUED TO BORROW. SOME THREE BILLION DOES THAT MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO BE CONTINUING THAT AND AS WELL THE GOVERNOR'S EMERGENCY AUTHORITY I LIKE TO GET INTO THAT IN GREATER DEPTH TWO. BUT I PARTICULARLY THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THAT BORROWING WHILE WE'RE INCREASING SPENDING VERY SUBSTANTIALLY. IN THE BUDGET DO YOU VIEW THAT AS THE MOST PRUDENT APPROACH FOR THE LEGISLATURE. WELL SENATOR NEIL FINN- YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT YOU'RE- SPEAKING TO IS REALLY. A AN IMPORTANT QUESTION OF TRADEOFFS AND RISK TOLERANCE AT THE END OF THE DAY AND- WHILE WE DID- MENTIONED THE CONTINUATION OF. THE USES OF THOSE RESOURCES IN THE CURRENT BUDGET I WOULD- YOU KNOW I WOULD NOTE THAT THE- YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGES IS COMPLYING WITH THE PROPOSITION TWO REQUIREMENTS AND INCREASING- THE RAINY DAY FUND DEPOSIT. AND IT DOES DO SOME OTHER THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T MENTIONS THAT THE PREVIOUSLY SUCH AS THE- FUNDING INTO THE SAFETY NET RESERVE- THE PREPAYMENT OF. OF BONDED DEBT SERVICE AND THEN- ALSO THE PAY DOWN THE FULL PAY DOWN OF THOSE SCHOOL DEFERRAL. AND SO I THINK WHAT WHERE THAT LEAVES US IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAD YOU KNOW AT THIS POINT THE WRITTEN THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL RESERVES COMPARED TO- TWENTY YEARS AGO OR BEFORE THE GREAT RECESSION AND SO THAT'S ONE IMPORTANT- CREDITS TO START WITH BUT THEN I GUESS YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY. IT WILL BE UP FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO. BALANCE THE TRADEOFFS AND ASSESS ITS RISK TOLERANCE FOR- TO KIND OF OPPOSING TENSIONS WANTED TO PREPARE FOR THE NEXT DOWNTURN BY YOU KNOW REPLENISHING EVEN MORE RESERVES ARE USING A LOT OF DISCRETIONARY RESERVES FOR- REPLENISH THEIR BUILDING RESERVES PURSES- USING THE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THAT HAD THAT HAND TO ADDRESS SOME OF ITS PRIORITIES AT THIS TIME THEN YOU COULD. MAKE A CASE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT BUT- YOU KNOW IF IT TURNS OUT THAT WE DON'T HAVE A DOWNTURN IN THE YOU KNOW NEXT FEW YEARS THAT COULD- PROVED TO BE SOMEWHAT OF A MISSED OPPORTUNITY IF THERE ARE LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES THAT. WARRANTS ATTENTION AT THIS TIME AND SO I THINK THE DISCUSSION YOU'RE HAVING TODAY IS REALLY ABOUT THOSE COMPETING ARE PRIORITIES AND WHERE ARE YOU- ULTIMATELY RANK THEM AND HOW HOW ARE YOU- AND INCORPORATE THAT INTO. YOUR OVERALL RISK TOLERANCE. WELL THE CONCERN I HAVE IS ALWAYS BETTER BUILDING- THAT WE DO THINGS THAT BUILD THE BASE AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO BORROW AND IN ADDITION HERE WE ARE CONTINUING TO PROCEED TO THE GOVERNOR THESE ARE EMERGENCY STARTING XI JEALOUSLY SEEMS TO GUARD THOSE. YEAH THAT MADE A LOT OF SENSE SOME TIME AGO TO ME GIVING THE GOVERNOR THOSE EMERGENCY AUTHORITIES. BUT GOVERNORS PLURAL HAVE BEEN VERY JEALOUSLY PROTECTING THAT THORGY. WHICH YOU SEARCH THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IT GIVES THE GOVERNOR THE AUTHORITY THAT I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE GOVERNORS HAVE BEEN ABUSING. THAT EMERGENCY AUTHORITY TO EXERCISE THEIR OWN PRIORITIES AND CIRCUMVENT THE LEGISLATURE AND WE THE LEGISLATURE THERE ARE TO BE DAMAGE FOR THAT WE HAVE FACILITATED. THE SEATING OF OUR CITIZENS. THE OPPORTUNITY TO INPUT THE BUDGET. AT AGAIN I JUST THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE WAXING CAUTIOUS AS WE PROCEED THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY HAD TO GO TO THE EQUALITY OR THE ENVIRONMENT QUALITY COMMITTEE SO- WILL SAVE HIS- QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR LATER- LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE.

PUBLIC SO I'M GONNA CALL ON- SEN DOLLY BECAUSE HE HAD HAD HIS HAND UP WITH ANY WANTED HE HAD A QUESTION- IN THE LET'S SEE IF THERE'S A OTHER MAY WHO HAVE COMMENTS QUESTIONS BEFORE WE TAKE A MOTION GO AHEAD SAID DOLLY. THANK YOU NATURAL FOR BELIEVE IT THE FOR. IN THE RECENT MADE OF. THE FUTURE. ECONOMY WE I THINK HE SAID IT THE GOOD FOR LIKE FOUR YEARS I WANTED TO. IF THEY INTO KIDS. SO SEEN ALREADY THE- MORE OF THE HIGHEST. IN AND IF THEY TOOK AN EIGHT COUNT INFLATION THAT WAS MY QUESTION MANAGER THANK YOU. I WILL LEAD DEPARTMENT FINANCE ANSWER BUT I DID WANT TO JUST POINT OUT MR DAILY THAT WAS ELLIE- THAT WAS REFERRING TO THOSE BUT- WE CAN CERTAINLY HAVE DAILY- COMMENT. ALSO GO AHEAD ERICA. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLINGER QUESTION AND I'LL WOULD JUST EITERATE THAT- OUR BUDGET INCLUDES LOWER REVENUES- IN THE CURRENT IN THE IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND IN THE OUT YEARS THEN COMPARED TO THE L. A. O. THE LA- REVENUES- DO GROW. AT ABOUT AT LEAST FOUR PERCENT- IN THE OUT YEARS AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MAY REVISION. AND THE- BUDGET REVENUES INCLUDED EIGHTY ONE TWENTY EIGHT. ROAD TO BE ABOUT TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS AT TWENTY BILLION IN IN IN A DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE GAP. AND SO- I THINK EITHER QUESTION- IS MORE IN LINE WITH THE ALLEY ON REVENUE SO I'LL TURN IT OVER. TO- MR PADDOCK. MR PADDOCK AHEAD. OKAY YOU- YES SORRY I THINK- OUR REVENUES I WILL JUST KNOW- SENATOR DOLLY PARTON. MY COMMENTS ON OUR REVENUE OUTLOOK WE'RE PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON KIND OF THE BUDGET YEAR PERIOD. AND YOU pPARTICULAR. WE THINK IT. YOU KNOW WE HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE IN OUR IN OUR FORECAST OF COURSE OVER THE NEXT. TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS. THEN MAYBE YOU KNOW THERE IS GREATER UNCERTAINTY THE FURTHER YOU GO OUT. INTO THE FUTURE. AND SO. THAT'S THAT'S THE FIRST POINT THE OTHER POINT I MEAN I THINK YOU'RE- COMMENTS ABOUT INFLATION OR OR WILL TAKE AND- YOU KNOW LIKE IN MY MIND ONE OF THE BIGGER RISKS RELATED TO INFLATION WOULD JUST BE. BETTER IF THEY DID THE- BECOME HIGHER THAN EXPECTED OR IF THE CONSUMER EXPECTATIONS AN EMPLOYER EXPECTATIONS BECAME WHAT THEY CALL UNANCHORED- YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS SOME POTENTIAL THAT THE FED WOULD HAVE TO ACT SOONER THAN THEY'RE CURRENTLY SIGNALING TO THE TO THE MARKET. AND IN THAT SCENARIO THERE IS SOME POTENTIAL THAT- FED TIGHTENING COULD CAUSE THE ECONOMY TO SLOW AND IN THAT SCENARIO WE WOULD EXPECT- REVENUE GROWTH TO SLOW AS WELL SO I MEAN I DON'T THINK THAT'S OUTSIDE OF THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY AT ALL BUT- BUT AT THE SAME TIME I MEAN THERE. ARE A LOT OF INDICATIONS THAT A LOT OF THE INFLATIONARY PRESSURES THAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW I'LL HAVE TO DO WITH KIND. BASED EFFECTIVE COMPARING- CURRENT PRICE LEVELS TO WHERE THEY YOU KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON ONE YEAR AGO WHEN THE ECONOMY WAS IN A FREE FALL. AND SO WE'RE KIND OF COMPARING THAT- CURRENT PRICE CHANGES AGAINST- ABNORMAL- BASE FROM LAST YEAR AND SO YOU KNOW SOME OF THE CHANGES TO THAT WERE SEEN OUT OF A SUPPLY CHAIN- DISRUPTIONS DUE TO THAT IS TO THE PANDEMIC IN TRYING TO TURN THE ECONOMY. YOU KNOW BACK ON IF YOU WILL AND YOU KNOW SO THERE IS A GOOD POSSIBILITY THAT A LOT OF THE INFLATION THAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW COULD PROVE TO BE RELATIVELY TRANSITORY AND- NOT WITH THAT- GOING FORWARD BUT IT I MEAN I DON'T. I DON'T WANT TO- YOU KNOW BE TOO SANGUINE ABOUT THAT I THINK YOUR YOUR- YOUR CONCERN ABOUT IT IS- FOUNDED ON SOME REASONABLE- BASIS SO. THANK YOU RON CHURCHES. YEAH GO AHEAD JUST A- SO JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT THE THAT WE NEED TO BE TALKING OF THE FACT THAT. HE WILL WORSEN PLACE. AND WE EVEN FEW. NOT CAL. BUT IT FEDERAL. I MEAN. SIX TRILLION DOLLARS INTO THE ECONOMY- AND THAT'S IN IT WITH AND WE HAVE SEEN AND WE'VE HEARD THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE INTEREST RATES STAY FLAT- THEY'RE EDGING UP A LITTLE BIT BUT NOT AT THE RATE OF INFLATION SO JUST A JUST A COMMON IF IT. IF IT COST YOU. BUT YOU KNOW TWICE AS MUCH TO GET DONE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BECAUSE INFLATION AND THEY KNOW IT REALLY IS GOING TO IMPACT OUTCOMES OF OUR BUDGET AND SO I JUST WANTED TO. SEE WHAT THEY TOOK THAT INTO CONSIDERATION I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU. I'M SENATOR DRAWS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I TOO WANT TO THANK THE STAFF IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND MADAM CHAIR EVERYONE ALL OF OUR OUR TEAMS- I BELIEVE THAT- PUTTING MONEY IN THE POCKETS OF WORKING PEOPLE WORKING MEN AND WOMEN IS WHAT LEADS TO A STRONG AND RELIABLE ECONOMY AND I THINK SO MUCH OF THAT HAS STARTED TO HAPPEN ALREADY- YOU KNOW THERE'S FEDERAL AND STATE DOLLARS FOR BUSINESSES TO OPEN AND- GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. CONTINUE TO HELP THE UNEMPLOYED- BUT MANY WERE LEFT OUT AND THAT'S WHERE GOVERNMENT- HAS TO STEP IN. TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE WHO WORK. TO MAKE A GOOD LIVING- THEY SPEND THAT MONEY. YOU KNOW THE WEALTHIER YOU ARE THE LESS MONEY YOU SPEND- AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT ON THE GROUND WHEN WORKING PEOPLE HAVE THAT MONEY. THEY CIRCULATE THAT MONEY THEY PAY THE RENT THEY BUY THE FOOD THOSE ARE REAL DAILY THINGS THAT WE COULD HELP AS GOVERNMENT MAKE SURE. THEY SPEND THE MONEY THEY DON'T PUT THEIR MONEY IN OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS- AND I WAS VERY PROUD THAT THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE IN THIS BUDGET- ARE PART OF THAT MAKING IT A WORKING PEOPLES- ECONOMY WORK MORE PEOPLE'S- BENEFIT THE- A FEW PEOPLE. ABOUT TO HIGH ROAD TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS- MONEY TOO FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT DONE MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE REAL. TRAINING PROGRAMS- WITH REGARDS TO OTHER ISSUES AND LABOR YES THERE'S MONEY FOR THE EDT. THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THE WORK WORKLOAD NEEDS AND OTHER ISSUES AT THE E. D. D. TRANSPORTATION. FIVE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW SPENDING FOR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S OUR OPPORTUNITY TO PUT PEOPLE TO WORK IN GOOD PAYING JOBS. JUSTICE REFORM AND COURTS LEMONADE IN CRIMINAL FEES AND ADMINISTRATIVE FEES AND CIVIL ASSESSMENT. THAT'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO KEEP MONEY IN THE POCKETS OF REGULAR WORKING PEOPLE- RESTORING MONEY TO OUR COURT- TO BE ABLE TO PROCESS BACKLOGS AND PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. OFFERS SO MANY PEOPLE. LEGAL AID SERVICES FOR RENTERS AND HOMEOWNERS. ARE REHABILITATION REENTRY. I VISITED REDUCTION TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THAT SO THAT. MEN AND WOMEN WHO GET OUT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WE MOVED- BARRIER SO THAT THEY- RE ENTER SUCCESSFULLY AND THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE AS WE GET PAST THIS PANDEMIC AND REBUILD OUR ECONOMY IS RELIEF FOR UTILITY THAT. A TOTAL OF ALMOST FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FOR YOU. OUR WATER DEBT RELIEF ENERGY A UTILITY DEBT RELIEF EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE SO I AM PROUD THAT WE'RE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION STRONG MEASURES ARE TAKEN UP WITH OUR BUDGET AND I APPRECIATE. ALL OF THE ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WHO COMMUNICATE WITH OUR OFFICES TO. LET US KNOW WHAT THEY THINK ARE THE RIGHT SOLUTIONS ARE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR DRAWS OF SENATOR PANTS. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- AND I KNOW WE'VE- SPENT A LOT OF TIME DEVELOPING THIS- VERY IMPORTANT BUDGET AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE ON GOING CONVERSATIONS IN MINISTRATION TO- IN TERMS OF FINALIZING THE BUDGET BUT I JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY SAY THAT- YOU KNOW PART OF THE REASON WE ARE WHERE WE'RE AT. WE HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS- WITH- COATED AND- AND WHAT RESULTED FROM THAT AND SO ONE OF THINGS I DEFINITELY WANT TO MAKE NOTE. IS IN THIS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL IS THE- FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE POINT ONE MILLION WITH- FORTY THREE MILLION ANNUALLY THEREAFTER TO BUILD AN EQUITABLE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. HOPEFULLY OF THE TREMENDOUS. SUFFERING THAT'S HAPPENED AS A RESULT OF- THIS PANDEMIC- CERTAINLY HIGHLIGHTED- DEFICIENCIES- AIMED AT YOUNG PEOPLE BROUGHT UP EDT AND SOME OTHER THINGS BUT THIS IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCY- THAT- HAS LED TO BOTH OF. PERSONAL SUFFERING AS WELL AS ECONOMIC- CHALLENGES- FOR OUR STATE SO I DO WANNA THANK- OUR LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP FOR- BE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THIS THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM THAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH FOR OVER THE PAST MORE THAN THE PAST YEAR AND SO THANKS VERY MUCH I JUST WANTED.
