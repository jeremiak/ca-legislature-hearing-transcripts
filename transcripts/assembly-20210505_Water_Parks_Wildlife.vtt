CALIFORNIA- WE DID AND THEY

00:35:04.268 --> 00:35:05.803
SAID BUT SIGNIFICANT DROUGHT

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:09.240
RECENTLY- IF IT LASTED FROM TWO

00:35:09.307 --> 00:35:10.641
THOUSAND TWELVE THROUGH TWO

00:35:10.708 --> 00:35:11.275
THOUSAND SIXTEEN ALTHOUGH SOME

00:35:11.342 --> 00:35:12.410
MIGHT SAY IT ACTUALLY STARTED

00:35:12.477 --> 00:35:14.178
IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. AND WE

00:35:14.245 --> 00:35:15.646
JUST HAD ONE WHEN YOU'RE IN THE

00:35:15.713 --> 00:35:17.081
MIDDLE IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN

00:35:17.148 --> 00:35:20.051
THAT THAT BROKE IT UP- BUT THAT

00:35:20.117 --> 00:35:21.385
THAT DROUGHT WAS REALLY

00:35:21.452 --> 00:35:23.454
SIGNIFICANT IN A LOT OF WAYS IT

00:35:23.521 --> 00:35:25.590
WAS THAT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND

00:35:25.656 --> 00:35:26.824
TWELVE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN

00:35:26.891 --> 00:35:28.192
THE DRIEST FOUR YEAR STRETCH.

00:35:28.259 --> 00:35:29.861
ON RECORD IN CALIFORNIA

00:35:29.927 --> 00:35:32.930
CONSECUTIVE YEARS- IN TWO

00:35:32.997 --> 00:35:34.031
THOUSAND FOURTEEN WAS THE THIRD

00:35:34.098 --> 00:35:36.234
DRIEST YEAR ON RECORD. AND

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.135
THOSE THOSE DRY CONDITIONS A

00:35:38.202 --> 00:35:39.270
LACK OF PRECIPITATION WE'RE

00:35:39.337 --> 00:35:41.572
REALLY COMPOUNDED BY ALSO

00:35:41.639 --> 00:35:44.809
HISTORICALLY HIGH TEMPERATURES-

00:35:44.876 --> 00:35:46.277
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND TWO

00:35:46.344 --> 00:35:46.744
THOUSAND FOURTEEN WERE

00:35:46.811 --> 00:35:48.779
RESPECTIVELY THE HIGHEST. TWO

00:35:48.846 --> 00:35:49.914
YEARS HOTTEST TWO YEARS ON

00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:51.916
RECORD IN CALIFORNIA. AND OF

00:35:51.983 --> 00:35:53.351
COURSE WE KNOW THAT WHILE I'M

00:35:53.417 --> 00:35:54.986
WARM TEMPERATURES EXACERBATING

00:35:55.052 --> 00:35:56.387
DRY CONDITIONS THEY BOTH

00:35:56.454 --> 00:35:58.523
INCREASED DEMAND FOR WATER FOR

00:35:58.589 --> 00:36:00.958
IRRIGATION FOR AGRICULTURE. AS

00:36:01.025 --> 00:36:03.094
WELL AS IN URBAN SETTINGS- AND

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.996
THEY ALSO DECREASE SNOWMELT

00:36:05.062 --> 00:36:07.565
RUNOFF BECAUSE OF EVAPORATION

00:36:07.632 --> 00:36:09.667
AND DRIER SOILS THAT SOAK UP

00:36:09.734 --> 00:36:12.003
THAT WATER- SO RIGHT SO REALLY

00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:14.505
YEAH- A DIFFICULT COMBINATION

00:36:14.572 --> 00:36:17.074
OF HIGH TEMPERATURES AND- AND

00:36:17.141 --> 00:36:19.777
LACK OF PRECIPITATION. SO THE

00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:22.013
DROUGHT IMPACTED. SECTORS ALL

00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:23.381
ACROSS CALIFORNIA IN MANY

00:36:23.447 --> 00:36:25.216
DIFFERENT WAYS. URBAN

00:36:25.283 --> 00:36:26.884
COMMUNITIES RURAL COMMUNITIES

00:36:26.951 --> 00:36:29.921
AGRICULTURE AT A PARENT PAYMENT

00:36:29.987 --> 00:36:31.055
I KNOW THAT YOUR THIRD PANEL

00:36:31.122 --> 00:36:32.089
HAS RELEASED OTHER

00:36:32.156 --> 00:36:33.257
REPRESENTATIVES WHO WILL GO

00:36:33.324 --> 00:36:34.458
INTO THE IMPACTS FOR EACH OF

00:36:34.525 --> 00:36:36.427
THOSE SECTORS SPECIFICALLY SO I

00:36:36.494 --> 00:36:38.396
THINK I'LL SKIP OVER- TRYING

00:36:38.462 --> 00:36:44.835

00:36:44.902 --> 00:36:45.436
STILL GET THOSE IN YOUR THIRD

00:36:45.503 --> 00:36:47.038
PANEL. SO TO EACH YEAR OVER

00:36:47.104 --> 00:36:49.540
HAND THAT. ADD THIS SUMMER. HOW

00:36:49.607 --> 00:36:50.841
THE SPEED STAY SPEND MY TO

00:36:50.908 --> 00:36:51.475
RESPOND TO THE LAST AS YOU CAN

00:36:51.542 --> 00:36:52.843
SEE IT WAS A TOTAL OF FOUR

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:54.879
FOUR. DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDING

00:36:54.946 --> 00:36:55.613
THAT SPREAD ACROSS FOUR

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.481
DIFFERENT YEARS. AND YOU CAN

00:36:57.548 --> 00:36:58.816
SEE THAT THE BIGGEST CATEGORY

00:36:58.883 --> 00:37:00.818
THERE WAS FOR WATER SUPPLY TWO

00:37:00.885 --> 00:37:02.553
POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:04.322
THOSE ARE REALLY FOR A BIGGER

00:37:04.388 --> 00:37:07.258
LONGER TERM PROJECTS INTENDED

00:37:07.325 --> 00:37:08.292
TO INCREASE THE STATE'S

00:37:08.359 --> 00:37:09.860
RESILIENCE FOR FUTURE DROUGHTS

00:37:09.927 --> 00:37:12.029
THEY DIDN'T REALLY THOSE TYPE

00:37:12.096 --> 00:37:13.030
FOR BIG LONG TERM PROJECTS

00:37:13.097 --> 00:37:14.532
DON'T REALLY HELP. IN THE

00:37:14.599 --> 00:37:15.866
MIDDLE OF A DROUGHT BECAUSE

00:37:15.933 --> 00:37:17.902
THEY DO TAKE A LONG TIME TO

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:20.004
PERMITTED TO RETAIN FINANCING

00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:22.673
TO- KIND OF GET CONSTRUCTION

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.076
AND GET UNDER WAY- SO THAT THAT

00:37:25.142 --> 00:37:26.477
BIGGER CATEGORY HOPEFULLY WILL

00:37:26.544 --> 00:37:28.279
HELP US. NOW SEVERAL YEARS

00:37:28.346 --> 00:37:29.280
LATER AS WE'RE FACING ANOTHER

00:37:29.347 --> 00:37:31.215
DROUGHT BUT REALLY HAVEN'T

00:37:31.282 --> 00:37:32.316
PROBABLY DIDN'T PROVIDE TOO

00:37:32.383 --> 00:37:33.851
MUCH RELIEF IN THE MIDST OF THE

00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:35.886
LAST DROUGHT. ALL RIGHT NOW

00:37:35.953 --> 00:37:36.988
THAT'S THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM

00:37:37.054 --> 00:37:38.155
THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE

00:37:38.222 --> 00:37:39.924
CATEGORIES YOU SEE HERE WHICH

00:37:39.991 --> 00:37:42.326
REALLY WORK SPENDING TO TRY AND

00:37:42.393 --> 00:37:44.862
ADDRESS MELIORATE- PRESSING

00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:48.466
URGENT CONDITIONS THINGS LIKE.

00:37:48.532 --> 00:37:50.201
WELLS GOING DRY EMERGENCY

00:37:50.267 --> 00:37:51.902
DRINKING WATER NEEDS DEAD AND

00:37:51.969 --> 00:37:53.270
DYING TREES THAT NEEDED TO BE

00:37:53.337 --> 00:37:56.340
REMOVED- FIRE. FIRES BREAKING

00:37:56.407 --> 00:37:58.876
OUT SO. THAT THEIR WORK AND IT

00:37:58.943 --> 00:38:04.315
SHOULD BE TO DIRECTLY. TO BEING

00:38:04.382 --> 00:38:05.049
WORSE BECAUSE OF THE DROUGHT.

00:38:05.116 --> 00:38:05.950
AND THEN WHAT I CAN. A WHICH

00:38:06.017 --> 00:38:07.118
YOU SEE THE SEND NEXT. AS WELL

00:38:07.184 --> 00:38:08.953
I THINK I'VE CHECKED CATEGORIES

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.588
THEY BOTH CAN HELP REDUCE

00:38:10.655 --> 00:38:12.690
DEMAND IN RESPONSE TO IMMEDIATE

00:38:12.757 --> 00:38:14.492
PRESSING DROUGHT CONDITIONS.

00:38:14.558 --> 00:38:16.093
BUT THEN ALSO HAVE ONGOING.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.664
RESULTS AND ASSISTANCE IF

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:23.000
THINGS LIKE REMOVING- TURF AND

00:38:23.067 --> 00:38:24.101
LAWN IN FRONT YARDS OR

00:38:24.168 --> 00:38:25.503
REPLACING TOILETS OR SHOWER

00:38:25.569 --> 00:38:27.071
HEADS WITH MORE EFFICIENT-

00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:29.473
FIXTURES. THAT CAN HELP REDUCE

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:30.975
WATER DEMAND ON AN ONGOING

00:38:31.042 --> 00:38:32.643
BASIS AND WE SEE THAT WE SEE

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:34.078
THAT- URBAN PER CAPITA WATER

00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:37.114
USE NOW IT REMAINS LESS THAN IT

00:38:37.181 --> 00:38:38.616
WAS IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN

00:38:38.683 --> 00:38:39.550
BEFORE THE LAST DROUGHT SO WE

00:38:39.617 --> 00:38:41.318
SEE THAT THAT HAS HAD. I'M

00:38:41.385 --> 00:38:43.320
GOING TO IMPLICATIONS. AND THEN

00:38:43.387 --> 00:38:45.189
THE FINAL CATEGORY OF SPENDING

00:38:45.256 --> 00:38:46.757
THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

00:38:46.824 --> 00:38:48.159
PROBABLY COULD ALSO HAVE FALLEN

00:38:48.225 --> 00:38:49.694
UNDER THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.262
HEADER FRANKLY BECAUSE A LOT OF

00:38:51.328 --> 00:38:52.997
THAT SPENDING THE MAJORITY THAT

00:38:53.064 --> 00:38:54.465
SPENDING WAS REALLY IN RESPONSE

00:38:54.532 --> 00:38:56.567
TO EMERGENCY CONDITIONS. THINGS

00:38:56.634 --> 00:38:58.602
LIKE TRACKING FISH DOWNSTREAM

00:38:58.669 --> 00:39:00.204
RESCUING FISH FROM HATCHERIES

00:39:00.271 --> 00:39:02.440
ARE STREAMS WHERE- CONDITIONS

00:39:02.506 --> 00:39:05.910
HAVE DEGRADED- THAT ADDRESSING

00:39:05.976 --> 00:39:07.545
HUMAN WILDLIFE CONFLICT A

00:39:07.611 --> 00:39:09.146
CONFLICT FROM WILDLIFE COMING

00:39:09.213 --> 00:39:11.082
DOWN YOU KNOW HOW TO THE HILLS

00:39:11.148 --> 00:39:12.717
IN SEARCH OF FOOD BECAUSE OF.

00:39:12.783 --> 00:39:19.757
DRY CONDITIONS SO- THAT. WAS

00:39:19.824 --> 00:39:20.424
ALSO KIND OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE.

00:39:20.491 --> 00:39:21.058
IN LOOKING AT THESE EXPENDITURE

00:39:21.125 --> 00:39:23.294
THE WATER RIGHT UP TOP WITH

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.329
THREE PRETTY. YOU FIND. YOU

00:39:25.396 --> 00:39:28.265
RECALL THAT PROP ONE PASSED IN

00:39:28.332 --> 00:39:28.899
TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN SO IN THE

00:39:28.966 --> 00:39:30.768
MIDST OF THE DROUGHT SO THOSE

00:39:30.835 --> 00:39:32.169
BIG EXPENDITURES WERE PRIMARILY

00:39:32.236 --> 00:39:33.771
CAPITAL PRIMARILY SUPPORTED BY

00:39:33.838 --> 00:39:35.673
BONDS. WHERE IS IN CONTRAST

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:36.974
THESE OTHER EXPENDITURES WERE

00:39:37.041 --> 00:39:38.876
PRIMARILY GENERAL FUND OF THE

00:39:38.943 --> 00:39:39.744
TOTAL SPENDING GENERAL FUND

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:41.779
MADE UP ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED

00:39:41.846 --> 00:39:43.047
MILLION ROUGHLY ABOUT 20% OF

00:39:43.114 --> 00:39:44.882
THE TOTAL SPENDING. AND THEN

00:39:44.949 --> 00:39:46.050
THERE WAS ALSO SOME SUPPORT

00:39:46.117 --> 00:39:47.885
FROM SOME SPECIAL FUNDS WHEN

00:39:47.952 --> 00:39:48.986
THE STATE WAS ABLE TO KIND OF

00:39:49.053 --> 00:39:50.054
FIND THE NEXUS BETWEEN THE

00:39:50.121 --> 00:39:51.756
REQUIREMENTS OF PARTICULAR

00:39:51.822 --> 00:39:53.557
SPECIAL FUNDS. AND THE ACTIVITY

00:39:53.624 --> 00:39:56.827
OF WANTED TO PERFORM- BUT BONDS

00:39:56.894 --> 00:39:58.162
TO TYPICALLY ARE NOT WELL

00:39:58.229 --> 00:39:59.163
SUITED FOR THAT KIND OF

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:01.098
EMERGENCY RESPONSE BECAUSE OF

00:40:01.165 --> 00:40:05.136
THE OF THE DAY ARE THERE

00:40:05.202 --> 00:40:05.770
TYPICALLY FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS.

00:40:05.836 --> 00:40:07.438
SO THE NEXT PAGE PAGE THREE OF

00:40:07.505 --> 00:40:09.206
MY HAND OUT REALLY. COVERS WHAT

00:40:09.273 --> 00:40:10.708
I JUST SAID VERBALLY SO WE'LL

00:40:10.775 --> 00:40:13.744
SKIP AHEAD TO PAGE FOUR. I'M

00:40:13.811 --> 00:40:15.880
HERE YOU CAN SEE I WON'T GO

00:40:15.946 --> 00:40:17.515
INTO THIS IN GREAT DETAIL BUT

00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:18.816
JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU

00:40:18.883 --> 00:40:19.984
THAT THE DROUGHT RESPONSE

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:22.319
REALLY INVOLVED A LOT OF STATE

00:40:22.386 --> 00:40:23.888
AGENCY FOURTEEN DIFFERENT STATE

00:40:23.954 --> 00:40:25.923
AGENCIES THESE REPRESENT THE-

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:27.224
DEPARTMENTS THAT RECEIVED A

00:40:27.291 --> 00:40:28.826
SHARE OF THAT THREE POINT FOUR

00:40:28.893 --> 00:40:29.794
BILLION SHOWN ON THE PREVIOUS

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.029
CHART. SO WHILE CERTAIN

00:40:32.096 --> 00:40:33.597
AGENCIES LIKE THE ONES YOU'LL

00:40:33.664 --> 00:40:34.865
HEAR FROM TODAY FISH AND

00:40:34.932 --> 00:40:37.067
WILDLIFE D. W. R. AND THAT

00:40:37.134 --> 00:40:38.302
STATE WATER BOARD PLAYED REALLY

00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:40.671
BIG ROLES. IMPORTANT HERE TO

00:40:40.738 --> 00:40:41.772
SEE THAT OTHER STATE

00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:43.007
DEPARTMENTS ALSO PLAYED A ROLE

00:40:43.073 --> 00:40:44.475
AND RECEIVED FUNDING IN DROUGHT

00:40:44.542 --> 00:40:47.344
RESPONSE. SO I'M- REALLY

00:40:47.411 --> 00:40:48.312
HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR

00:40:48.379 --> 00:40:49.914
COORDINATION OF COME BACK TO

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.849
THAT AGAIN IN A MOMENT I ALSO

00:40:51.916 --> 00:40:52.783
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU THAT

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:53.617
SOME OF THESE DIFFERENT

00:40:53.684 --> 00:40:55.252
DEPARTMENTS WERE FUNDED FOR

00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:56.587
PRETTY SIMILAR EFFORTS YOU CAN

00:40:56.654 --> 00:40:59.390
SEE D. W. R. O. YES AND THE

00:40:59.456 --> 00:41:00.825
WATER BOARD WERE ALL RECEIVED

00:41:00.891 --> 00:41:03.027
FUNDING FOR ADDRESSING

00:41:03.093 --> 00:41:05.062
EMERGENCY DRINKING WATER. NEEDS

00:41:05.129 --> 00:41:07.364
IN SIMILARLY CALIFORNIA WE ASK

00:41:07.431 --> 00:41:08.966
BOTH RECEIVED FUNDING FOR

00:41:09.033 --> 00:41:11.702
REMOVING DEAD TREES- SO FUNDING

00:41:11.769 --> 00:41:17.641
SPREAD ACROSS A WIDE. A WIDE.

00:41:17.708 --> 00:41:18.509
SWATH OF STATE GOVERNMENT HERE.

00:41:18.576 --> 00:41:20.377
TURNING TO PAGE. OF THE HANDOUT.

00:41:20.444 --> 00:41:21.645
BUT IT WASN'T JUST SPENDING

00:41:21.712 --> 00:41:22.980
MORE THAN JUST MONEY THERE ARE

00:41:23.047 --> 00:41:24.348
ALSO SOME SIGNIFICANT POLICY

00:41:24.415 --> 00:41:25.950
CHANGES ENACTED BY THE STATE

00:41:26.016 --> 00:41:27.418
AND RESPONDING TO THE DROUGHT-

00:41:27.484 --> 00:41:30.421
SOME OF THOSE WERE- KIND OF AN

00:41:30.487 --> 00:41:32.122
EMERGENCY SHORT TERM BASIS

00:41:32.189 --> 00:41:34.892
EITHER THROUGH. EXECUTIVE ORDER

00:41:34.959 --> 00:41:37.428
I'M REGENCY REGULATIONS OR THE

00:41:37.494 --> 00:41:39.530
EXISTING REGULATORY AUTHORITY

00:41:39.597 --> 00:41:41.265
HAVE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS.

00:41:41.332 --> 00:41:42.666
THESE INCLUDED WATER STATEWIDE

00:41:42.733 --> 00:41:44.869
WATER CONSERVATION REQUIREMENTS

00:41:44.935 --> 00:41:47.071
FOR URBAN COMMUNITIES- THE

00:41:47.137 --> 00:41:48.672
WATER BOARD TEMPORARILY RELAXED

00:41:48.739 --> 00:41:50.574
FLOWING WATER QUALITY STANDARDS

00:41:50.641 --> 00:41:52.209
WITHIN THE DELTA CANNOT ORDERED

00:41:52.276 --> 00:41:54.478
AN ENFORCED. THAT LAST WATER BE

00:41:54.545 --> 00:41:56.113
DIVERTED FROM THE STATE'S

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.848
RIVERS AND STREAMS. A FISHING

00:41:57.915 --> 00:41:59.216
GAME COMMISSION CLOSED SEVEN

00:41:59.283 --> 00:42:00.718
RIVERS AND STREAMS TO FISHING

00:42:00.784 --> 00:42:02.686
IN ORDER TO PROTECT FISH IN LOW

00:42:02.753 --> 00:42:04.955
WATER FLOW AREAS. AND THEN THE

00:42:05.022 --> 00:42:06.891
STATE ALSO A WAVE SOME STATE

00:42:06.957 --> 00:42:08.359
REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS

00:42:08.425 --> 00:42:10.094
CONTRACTING AND- SEACOR

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.029
REQUIREMENTS FOR IN ORDER TO

00:42:12.096 --> 00:42:16.233
EXPEDITE. SOME DROUGHT RESPONSE

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:16.934
ACTIVITIES. BUT IN ADDITION

00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:18.369
THOSE TERM ACTIVITIES THE STATE

00:42:18.435 --> 00:42:20.137
ALSO AND PRIMARILY THROUGH THE

00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:21.839
LEGISLATURE SOME THROUGH

00:42:21.906 --> 00:42:23.040
REGULATIONS BUT PRIMARILY

00:42:23.107 --> 00:42:24.842
THROUGH LEGISLATION ADOPTED

00:42:24.909 --> 00:42:27.177
SOME ONGOING- PERMANENT CHANGES

00:42:27.244 --> 00:42:29.013
AS WELL AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST

00:42:29.079 --> 00:42:30.247
WAS A PATH TO SUSTAINABLE

00:42:30.314 --> 00:42:31.482
GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT

00:42:31.548 --> 00:42:32.316
WHICH IN OF THIS COMMITTEE IS

00:42:32.383 --> 00:42:34.184
VERY FAMILIAR WITH IN TWO

00:42:34.251 --> 00:42:36.420
THOUSAND FOURTEEN. TO REGULATE

00:42:36.487 --> 00:42:38.222
THE STATE'S USE OF GROUNDWATER.

00:42:38.289 --> 00:42:39.590
THERE WAS ALSO LEGISLATION

00:42:39.657 --> 00:42:42.426
ENACTED TO- AUTHORIZES STATE TO

00:42:42.493 --> 00:42:44.228
CONSOLIDATE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS

00:42:44.295 --> 00:42:45.496
THAT FAIL TO MEET DRINKING

00:42:45.562 --> 00:42:47.164
WATER STANDARDS. BY NEW

00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:48.866
STANDARDS FOR WATER EFFICIENCY

00:42:48.933 --> 00:42:50.534
AND OUTDOOR LANDSCAPES AS WELL

00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:53.537
AS- FOR CONSERVATION OF

00:42:53.604 --> 00:42:55.472
PLANNING AND CITIES AND URBAN

00:42:55.539 --> 00:42:58.008
COMMUNITIES. AND WHILE IT WAS

00:42:58.075 --> 00:42:59.410
ADOPTED IN TWO THOUSAND

00:42:59.476 --> 00:42:59.977
EIGHTEEN WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY

00:43:00.044 --> 00:43:01.378
AFTER THE DROUGHT ENDED THIS

00:43:01.445 --> 00:43:02.479
EVENING AFFORDABLE DRINKING

00:43:02.546 --> 00:43:04.481
WATER FUND WHICH PROVIDES A

00:43:04.548 --> 00:43:05.015
HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION

00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:06.250
DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO ADDRESS

00:43:06.317 --> 00:43:08.052
DRINKING WATER ISSUES. I THINK

00:43:08.118 --> 00:43:08.919
IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT WAS

00:43:08.986 --> 00:43:10.521
REALLY MOTIVATED BY SOME OF THE

00:43:10.587 --> 00:43:13.057
PROBLEMS THAT- ERE EXACERBATED

00:43:13.123 --> 00:43:14.058
AND HIGHLIGHTED DURING THE

00:43:14.124 --> 00:43:15.326
DROUGHT AS WELL THAT'S

00:43:15.392 --> 00:43:16.994
OBVIOUSLY ABSENT SIGNIFICANT

00:43:17.061 --> 00:43:21.632
ONGOING POLICY. CHANGES ACTED

00:43:21.699 --> 00:43:22.466
BY THE LEGISLATURE. SEVEN TWO

00:43:22.533 --> 00:43:24.335
TO THE- PAGE OF THE HANDOUT

00:43:24.401 --> 00:43:26.003
LESSONS TO INFORM THE CURRENT

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:26.737
DROUGHT I KNOW THIS IS

00:43:26.804 --> 00:43:28.005
SOMETHING THAT THE NEXT

00:43:28.072 --> 00:43:29.373
ADMINISTRATION PANEL IS GOING

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.607
TO TALK ABOUT AS WELL. BUT

00:43:30.674 --> 00:43:31.976
SENATE REALLY JUMPED OUT AT US

00:43:32.042 --> 00:43:33.377
FROM THIS LOOK BACK AT WHAT WE

00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:34.778
DID WITH THE STATUS STATE

00:43:34.845 --> 00:43:36.914
RESPONDED LAST TIME. AND ONE OF

00:43:36.981 --> 00:43:38.515
THE FIRST IS WHAT YOU ALL ARE

00:43:38.582 --> 00:43:39.917
DOING ALREADY TODAY WHICH IS

00:43:39.984 --> 00:43:41.819
HOW CAN E BE PROACTIVE RATHER

00:43:41.885 --> 00:43:44.321
THAN REACTIVE. HOW CAN WE TAKE

00:43:44.388 --> 00:43:47.391
ACTIONS EARLY OR EARLIER BEFORE

00:43:47.458 --> 00:43:48.859
PROBLEMS WORSEN AND GET AHEAD

00:43:48.926 --> 00:43:50.661
OF. WHAT WE THINK THE PROBLEMS

00:43:50.728 --> 00:43:52.997
MIGHT BE AND WHAT WE SAW LAST

00:43:53.063 --> 00:43:57.201
TIME RATHER THAN WAITING UNTIL

00:43:57.267 --> 00:43:58.302
CONDITIONS GET REALLY DIRE. THE

00:43:58.369 --> 00:43:59.303
SECOND POINT HERE ON THE

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:00.971
COORDINATION AND EFFICIENCY OF

00:44:01.038 --> 00:44:02.206
STATE DEPARTMENTS BEING REALLY

00:44:02.272 --> 00:44:03.207
IMPORTANT I THINK YOU'LL HEAR

00:44:03.273 --> 00:44:04.541
ABOUT THIS IN THE NEXT PANEL AS

00:44:04.608 --> 00:44:06.076
WELL. HOW CAN WE AVOID

00:44:06.143 --> 00:44:07.411
DUPLICATION SHOULD WE BE

00:44:07.478 --> 00:44:08.278
FUNDING THREE DIFFERENT

00:44:08.345 --> 00:44:09.880
DEPARTMENTS TO ADDRESS DRINKING

00:44:09.947 --> 00:44:12.449
WATER ISSUES. MAYBE BUT MAYBE

00:44:12.516 --> 00:44:14.251
THAT CREATES SOME SOME-

00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:16.153
BUREAUCRACY AND DUPLICATION

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.156
THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE NECESSARY

00:44:19.223 --> 00:44:20.024
SO TAKING A LOOK AT HOW CAN WE

00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:23.293
BE- AS AS A FIX EFFECTIVE AND

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:24.261
EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE AS A

00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:26.063
STATE GOVERNMENT. AND THE MAIN

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:27.865
BOX YOU KNOW MORE STAFF MORE

00:44:27.931 --> 00:44:29.433
PERMANENT STAFF IF DROUGHT IS

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.001
THE NEW NORMAL TO TRY AND SET

00:44:31.068 --> 00:44:32.136
UP SOME OF THE STRUCTURE SO

00:44:32.202 --> 00:44:33.604
THAT WE ARE. BEING MORE

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:35.205
PROACTIVE AND PREPARED TO

00:44:35.272 --> 00:44:36.507
ACQUIRE NEED ACROSS ALL OF THE

00:44:36.573 --> 00:44:39.676
DIFFERENT AREAS OF STATE

00:44:39.743 --> 00:44:40.210
GOVERNMENT THEY NEED TO BE

00:44:40.277 --> 00:44:40.844
INVOLVED. THE THIRD POINT HERE

00:44:40.911 --> 00:44:42.546
IS WHEN I MENTIONED- EARLIER

00:44:42.613 --> 00:44:44.081
BUT REALLY THINKING. AS A

00:44:44.148 --> 00:44:45.682
LEGISLATURE HOW YOU WANT TO

00:44:45.749 --> 00:44:48.485
BALANCE YOUR LONG TERM RESPONSE

00:44:48.552 --> 00:44:49.953
TO FUTURE JOBS WITH THOSE

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:52.022
PRESSING NEEDS AND THOSE LARGE

00:44:52.089 --> 00:44:53.991
WATER SUPPLY. PROJECTS AND

00:44:54.058 --> 00:44:56.026
INVESTMENTS WELL IMPORTANT AND

00:44:56.093 --> 00:44:57.294
ESSENTIAL TO DROUGHT

00:44:57.361 --> 00:44:58.929
PREPAREDNESS. AREN'T AS

00:44:58.996 --> 00:45:00.397
EFFECTIVE IN IMMEDIATE DROUGHT

00:45:00.464 --> 00:45:02.032
RESPONSIVE THINKING ABOUT WHAT

00:45:02.099 --> 00:45:03.567
ARE YOUR GOALS. AND WHAT ARE

00:45:03.634 --> 00:45:04.902
THE APPROPRIATE FUNDING SOURCES

00:45:04.968 --> 00:45:07.037
AND- TAKES A PROJECT TO ADDRESS

00:45:07.104 --> 00:45:08.605
THOSE GOALS WHETHER THEY ARE

00:45:08.672 --> 00:45:11.675
SHORT TERM RESPONSE. OR AND-

00:45:11.742 --> 00:45:13.844
LONG TERM RESPONSE. AND THAT

00:45:13.911 --> 00:45:15.712
LEADS TO THE FOURTH POINT THERE

00:45:15.779 --> 00:45:17.915
ABOUT THE HAVE. FUN SOURCES AND

00:45:17.981 --> 00:45:19.516
THINKING ABOUT IF YOU WANT AND

00:45:19.583 --> 00:45:20.884
WHAT WE SAW DURING THE LAST

00:45:20.951 --> 00:45:21.752
ROUND WAS THAT FOR SOME OF

00:45:21.819 --> 00:45:23.287
THOSE IMMEDIATE RESPONSES

00:45:23.353 --> 00:45:25.656
EMERGENCY RESPONSES. BECAUSE OF

00:45:25.722 --> 00:45:28.826
IT'S FLEXIBILITY GENERAL FUND

00:45:28.892 --> 00:45:29.793
IS OFTEN THE BEST FOR. I HAVE

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:30.327
BEEN ON THE POINT I JUST

00:45:30.394 --> 00:45:32.096
MENTION THIS ISN'T THE BUDGET.

00:45:32.162 --> 00:45:33.263
BUT WANT TO BE SURE THAT ALL

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:34.932
THE MEMBERS HAVE ON THEIR RADAR

00:45:34.998 --> 00:45:36.233
OUR OFFICE PUT OUT A REPORT A

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:37.801
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO ON THE

00:45:37.868 --> 00:45:39.770
STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT.

00:45:39.837 --> 00:45:41.438
WHICH IS A NEW FACTOR THAT'S

00:45:41.505 --> 00:45:43.040
GOING TO BECOME A AN INCREASING

00:45:43.107 --> 00:45:44.741
ISSUE IN BUDGETARY DECISIONS

00:45:44.808 --> 00:45:45.943
AND WELL PLACED SOME

00:45:46.009 --> 00:45:47.244
LIMITATIONS EVEN AS WE FACE A

00:45:47.311 --> 00:45:49.179
HISTORIC SURPLUS. ON HOW THE

00:45:49.246 --> 00:45:50.814
STATE CAMPAñA CAN SPEND SOME

00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:52.683
OF THAT FUNDING. SO I WON'T GO

00:45:52.749 --> 00:45:54.585
INTO DETAIL ON HERE UNLESS

00:45:54.651 --> 00:45:55.886
THERE ARE QUESTIONS I'M HAPPY

00:45:55.953 --> 00:45:57.621
TO ADDRESS BUT JUST SOMETHING

00:45:57.688 --> 00:45:58.155
WE WANT TO BE SURE YOU ARE

00:45:58.222 --> 00:46:01.125
THINKING ABOUT. I'M THERE ARE-

00:46:01.191 --> 00:46:03.060
SOME TYPES OF EXPENDITURES THAT

00:46:03.127 --> 00:46:05.329
ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THAT LIMIT-

00:46:05.395 --> 00:46:06.930
AND THEN SOME THAT ARE SO AS

00:46:06.997 --> 00:46:07.998
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW I

00:46:08.065 --> 00:46:09.733
WOULD GO TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.069
AND HOW TO USE THE- STATE.

00:46:12.136 --> 00:46:15.772
FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE. IS

00:46:15.839 --> 00:46:16.707
THAT WILL BECOME A FACTOR. I AM

00:46:16.773 --> 00:46:18.308
AN EXPERT HERE I'M GOING. WATER

00:46:18.375 --> 00:46:20.010
CHALLENGES BECOME COMPOUNDED

00:46:20.077 --> 00:46:20.978
DURING DROUGHTS I THINK THAT

00:46:21.044 --> 00:46:23.080
WAS ONE OF THE BIG HIGHLIGHTS

00:46:23.147 --> 00:46:24.848
FROM THE LAST DROUGHT. WE DO

00:46:24.915 --> 00:46:26.183
HAVE ANY FUNDING SOURCE A NEW

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:27.484
PROGRAM TO ADDRESS DRINKING

00:46:27.551 --> 00:46:28.785
WATER ISSUES BUT I THINK WE

00:46:28.852 --> 00:46:30.821
SHOULD. ALL BE PREPARED IN THE

00:46:30.888 --> 00:46:32.222
STATE SHOULD REALLY HAVE. AS

00:46:32.289 --> 00:46:34.124
ONE OF ITS- PRIMARY FOCUS AREAS

00:46:34.191 --> 00:46:35.792
OF FOCUS IN THE COMING MONTHS

00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:36.793
AND YEARS THAT THAT THAT THAT

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:39.163
IS UNLIKELY TO BE ANOTHER. A

00:46:39.229 --> 00:46:41.632
RESURGING PROBLEM IS THAT I'M

00:46:41.698 --> 00:46:43.200
DRINKING WATER ISSUES. THAT

00:46:43.267 --> 00:46:44.268
LEADS TO THE NEXT POINT THAT

00:46:44.334 --> 00:46:44.935
RURAL AND VULNERABLE

00:46:45.002 --> 00:46:46.470
COMMUNITIES ARE PARTICULARLY

00:46:46.537 --> 00:46:48.238
AFFECTED BY DROUGHT WE SAW THIS

00:46:48.305 --> 00:46:50.007
DURING LAST DROUGHT. NOT

00:46:50.073 --> 00:46:51.542
JUST FROM DRINKING WATER BUT

00:46:51.608 --> 00:46:54.211
ALSO ECONOMIC IMPACTS- FROM

00:46:54.278 --> 00:46:56.713
AGRICULTURAL SLOWDOWNS- IN

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:58.849
PRODUCTION FOR EXAMPLE AND WE

00:46:58.916 --> 00:47:00.250
KNOW THAT LOW INCOME

00:47:00.317 --> 00:47:02.052
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ALSO FACE

00:47:02.119 --> 00:47:03.921
DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS FROM

00:47:03.987 --> 00:47:05.756
THE COBIT. NINETEEN PANDEMIC

00:47:05.822 --> 00:47:07.391
AND SO ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING

00:47:07.457 --> 00:47:09.159
SO AS WE THINK ABOUT HOW THE

00:47:09.226 --> 00:47:10.294
STATE'S GOING TO RESPOND IN

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:11.628
WHERE TO TARGET ITS ASSISTANCE

00:47:11.695 --> 00:47:12.796
THINKING ABOUT. WHAT

00:47:12.863 --> 00:47:13.964
COMMUNITIES MIGHT NEED THOSE

00:47:14.031 --> 00:47:15.132
ASSISTANCE THAT ASSISTANCE THE

00:47:15.199 --> 00:47:19.403
MOST- R. AS THEY FACE

00:47:19.469 --> 00:47:20.671
ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES- THE

00:47:20.737 --> 00:47:22.372
SECOND TO LAST POINT HERE ON

00:47:22.439 --> 00:47:24.875
FISH AND WILDLIFE JUST THE-

00:47:24.942 --> 00:47:26.543
REMINDER THAT THE STATE HAS THE

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:28.612
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT.

00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:30.747
PUBLIC TRUST RESOURCES SUCH AS

00:47:30.814 --> 00:47:32.616
FISH WILDLIFE AND WATERWAYS ON

00:47:32.683 --> 00:47:34.251
BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC SO AS WE

00:47:34.318 --> 00:47:36.019
THINK ABOUT OUR PRIORITIES AND

00:47:36.086 --> 00:47:37.521
OUR JOB RESPONSE WE CAN HAVE TO

00:47:37.588 --> 00:47:40.324
BALANCE HUMAN NEEDS AS WELL AS

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:42.726
ENVIRONMENTAL NEEDS. AND ONE OF

00:47:42.793 --> 00:47:44.761
THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL. IMPACTS

00:47:44.828 --> 00:47:46.029
THAT REALLY WAS HIGHLIGHTED

00:47:46.096 --> 00:47:47.431
DURING THE LAST DROUGHT WASN'T

00:47:47.497 --> 00:47:49.099
UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF DEAD

00:47:49.166 --> 00:47:52.102
TREES WHICH THEN CONTRIBUTED TO

00:47:52.169 --> 00:47:53.537
A MORE SEVERE AND INTENSE

00:47:53.604 --> 00:47:55.806
WILDFIRES WHICH LIKELY. WILL

00:47:55.872 --> 00:47:56.807
STATE SHOULD BE PREPARED TO

00:47:56.873 --> 00:47:58.709
SEE. WHETHER WHETHER THIS

00:47:58.775 --> 00:48:02.379
SUMMER- AND IN THE COMING YEARS

00:48:02.446 --> 00:48:03.947
OF DROUGHT CONDITIONS CONTINUE.

00:48:04.014 --> 00:48:05.382
SO I MISTER CHAIR THAT

00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:06.416
CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION I'M

00:48:06.483 --> 00:48:08.085
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS

00:48:08.151 --> 00:48:10.087
NOW AND ALSO HAPPY TO HANG

00:48:10.153 --> 00:48:12.089
AROUND AND- ANSWERED QUESTIONS

00:48:12.155 --> 00:48:13.757
AFTER THE ADMINISTRATION

00:48:13.824 --> 00:48:14.358
PRESENTS IF THERE ARE ANY FOR

00:48:14.424 --> 00:48:20.330
ME TO. WE WILL LOVE OPEN IT UP

00:48:20.397 --> 00:48:21.965
FOR ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS

00:48:22.032 --> 00:48:28.338
OF THE COMMITTEE. AT. ONE

00:48:28.405 --> 00:48:29.172
THIRTY- THANK YOU VERY MUCH

00:48:29.239 --> 00:48:30.774
RACIAL BUT MY QUESTION IS IN

00:48:30.841 --> 00:48:31.775
REGARDS TO THE STATE HAS

00:48:31.842 --> 00:48:34.044
RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY TWENTY

00:48:34.111 --> 00:48:34.811
SIX BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE

00:48:34.878 --> 00:48:36.647
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNDER THE

00:48:36.713 --> 00:48:38.815
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. WE ALL

00:48:38.882 --> 00:48:39.716
KNOW THAT THERE'S ALWAYS

00:48:39.783 --> 00:48:41.218
STRINGS ATTACHED TO IT WHEN IT

00:48:41.285 --> 00:48:41.685
COMES FROM THE FEDERAL

00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:43.887
GOVERNMENT. BUT WE KNOW THAT IT

00:48:43.954 --> 00:48:46.156
CAN BE USED FOR WATER. WHAT IS

00:48:46.223 --> 00:48:48.258
A TRADE OFF FOR THE LEGISLATURE

00:48:48.325 --> 00:48:49.926
TO UTILIZE THIS ONE TIME FUNDS

00:48:49.993 --> 00:48:51.528
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:48:51.595 --> 00:48:52.663
COMPARED TO A BOND ISSUE AND I

00:48:52.729 --> 00:48:54.197
THINK WE'RE TALKED INTO THIS

00:48:54.264 --> 00:48:56.133
COMMITTEE COUPLE TIMES THREE

00:48:56.199 --> 00:48:56.700
POINT FIVE THREE POINT EIGHT

00:48:56.767 --> 00:48:59.703
BILLION- SO HOW CAN YOU RESPOND

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:01.938
TO THAT FOR. THE OF THE

00:49:02.005 --> 00:49:04.941
RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA. THANK

00:49:05.008 --> 00:49:07.844
YOU YES WE ARE FORTUNATE TO

00:49:07.911 --> 00:49:09.846
RECEIVE THE FEDERAL FUNDING-

00:49:09.913 --> 00:49:11.114
THERE ARE AS YOU MENTIONED SOME

00:49:11.181 --> 00:49:12.282
REQUIREMENTS AROUND IT ALTHOUGH

00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:14.351
I WILL SAY THAT THIS THIS-

00:49:14.418 --> 00:49:16.053
FUNDING IS MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE

00:49:16.119 --> 00:49:18.388
THAN THAN. OTHER TYPES OF

00:49:18.455 --> 00:49:19.056
FEDERAL FUNDING THEN WE USUALLY

00:49:19.122 --> 00:49:21.625
RECEIVE SO IT CAN BE USED TO

00:49:21.692 --> 00:49:23.160
ADDRESS SOME OF THE IMPACTS OF

00:49:23.226 --> 00:49:24.361
THE COCA NINETEEN PANDEMIC

00:49:24.428 --> 00:49:25.662
THERE IS A NEXUS THERE WITH

00:49:25.729 --> 00:49:27.230
WATER PARTICULARLY AROUND WATER

00:49:27.297 --> 00:49:30.967
DEBT. AND SMALL WATER SYSTEMS

00:49:31.034 --> 00:49:32.436
AND HOUSEHOLDS THAT HAVE FORMED

00:49:32.502 --> 00:49:34.338
BEHIND THE WATER BOARD AN

00:49:34.404 --> 00:49:36.106
ESTIMATE JANUARY THE TOTAL TO

00:49:36.173 --> 00:49:37.274
AT LEAST A BILLION DOLLAR

00:49:37.341 --> 00:49:38.742
STATEWIDE SO THAT WAS MONTHS

00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:40.077
AGO SO THAT'S ONE AREA THAT YOU

00:49:40.143 --> 00:49:41.211
COULD THINK ABOUT TARGETING

00:49:41.278 --> 00:49:42.746
SOME OF THAT FEDERAL FUNDING

00:49:42.813 --> 00:49:43.747
THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE MORE

00:49:43.814 --> 00:49:46.450
APPROPRIATE TO USE THAT AS

00:49:46.516 --> 00:49:48.652
COMPARED TO A BOND- OTHER AREAS.

00:49:48.719 --> 00:49:49.920
IT CAN BE USED FOR WATER

00:49:49.986 --> 00:49:51.588
INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL- WHICH

00:49:51.655 --> 00:49:55.392
OFTEN IS- ALSO A BOND

00:49:55.459 --> 00:49:57.828
APPROPRIATE. SO SOME OF THE

00:49:57.894 --> 00:49:58.929
DIFFERENCES OBVIOUSLY WITH THE

00:49:58.995 --> 00:50:00.297
FEDERAL FUNDS WE DON'T HAVE

00:50:00.364 --> 00:50:03.233
BUDGET SERVICE- SO. WE CAN USE

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:05.736
THE FUNDS WITHOUT HAVING TO. BE

00:50:05.802 --> 00:50:07.471
CONCERNED ABOUT FUTURE COSTS ON

00:50:07.537 --> 00:50:09.306
THE GENERAL FUND. AND IT IS

00:50:09.373 --> 00:50:11.241
AVAILABLE KIND OF MORE READILY

00:50:11.308 --> 00:50:14.444
NOW- BUT THEY THERE MAY BE SOME

00:50:14.511 --> 00:50:15.178
REQUIREMENTS I THINK WE'RE

00:50:15.245 --> 00:50:16.213
STILL WAITING FROM ADDITIONAL

00:50:16.279 --> 00:50:17.214
GUIDANCE FROM THE FEDERAL

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.082
GOVERNMENT AROUND SPECIFICALLY

00:50:19.149 --> 00:50:20.984
WHAT TYPES OF PROJECTS. AND

00:50:21.051 --> 00:50:22.652
WATER PROJECTS. THE FUNDS CAN

00:50:22.719 --> 00:50:24.588
BE AS FAR AS COMPARED TO A

00:50:24.654 --> 00:50:26.223
BONDS THAT IF THE STATE WERE TO

00:50:26.289 --> 00:50:29.426
CRAFT. COULD ROOM BE ADDRESS IN

00:50:29.493 --> 00:50:31.328
SOME STATE SPECIFIC NEEDS THAT

00:50:31.395 --> 00:50:32.062
THAT PERHAPS FEDERAL FUNDS

00:50:32.129 --> 00:50:34.664
WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED. SO I THINK

00:50:34.731 --> 00:50:35.532
I THINK THERE'S CERTAINLY

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:36.833
OVERLAP WHEN IT COMES TO WATER

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.101
INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPITAL

00:50:38.168 --> 00:50:42.506
PROJECTS BUT THERE. ALSO COULD

00:50:42.572 --> 00:50:43.073
BE SOME DISTINCTION THERE.

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:44.408
THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN LOVE CAN

00:50:44.474 --> 00:50:45.509
OF REFER TO THAT DOUBLE R.

00:50:45.575 --> 00:50:47.144
LIMIT LATER ON FOR THE MONEY TO

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:48.378
RESOURCES THANK YOU. THANK YOU

00:50:48.445 --> 00:50:54.985
MISTER SMITH. YEAH QUESTIONS. I

00:50:55.051 --> 00:50:57.421
DO HAVE A QUESTION AND THAT'S

00:50:57.487 --> 00:51:00.257
IN REGARDS TO- ISSUES THAT COME

00:51:00.323 --> 00:51:01.691
UP REGULARLY OF BACKING UP

00:51:01.758 --> 00:51:03.160
TODAY AND DIFFERENT HEARING

00:51:03.226 --> 00:51:06.463
RELATED TO STORAGE AND- FUNDING

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:08.565
THAT'S BEEN PUT FORWARD. IN

00:51:08.632 --> 00:51:10.867
PRIOR BONDS THAT CAN YOU GIVE

00:51:10.934 --> 00:51:13.103
US AN OVERVIEW OF THE MONEY

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:14.271
THAT IS AVAILABLE FROM PREVIOUS

00:51:14.337 --> 00:51:16.640
BONDS RELATED TO- WATER

00:51:16.706 --> 00:51:19.009
INFRASTRUCTURES SPECIFICALLY IN

00:51:19.075 --> 00:51:22.879
THE STORAGE. AREA. YES

00:51:22.946 --> 00:51:24.481
PROPOSITION ONE WAS THE MOST

00:51:24.548 --> 00:51:25.982
RECENT BOND THAT INCLUDED QUITE

00:51:26.049 --> 00:51:27.384
A BIT OF FUNDING FOR STORAGE

00:51:27.451 --> 00:51:28.251
TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION

00:51:28.318 --> 00:51:30.220
DOLLARS- THE WAY THE BONTA

00:51:30.287 --> 00:51:31.755
STRUCTURED IT DIDN'T ALLOCATED

00:51:31.822 --> 00:51:33.156
FOR SPECIFIC PROJECTS BUT

00:51:33.223 --> 00:51:35.292
RATHER DUMB IT'S A CONTINUOUSLY

00:51:35.358 --> 00:51:36.259
PERFORATED DOESN'T EVEN GO

00:51:36.326 --> 00:51:37.394
THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:51:37.461 --> 00:51:39.229
IDENTIFY PROJECTS. IT'S CONVENE

00:51:39.296 --> 00:51:40.564
WITH CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:42.632
TO THE WATER COMMISSION TO

00:51:42.699 --> 00:51:44.868
DETERMINE HOW TO ALLOCATE THEM

00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:46.470
DEAFENING ACROSS DIFFERENT

00:51:46.536 --> 00:51:48.238
PROJECTS I THINK THEY CHOSE

00:51:48.305 --> 00:51:50.207
ABOUT EIGHT DIFFERENT PROJECTS

00:51:50.273 --> 00:51:53.076
FOR INITIAL ALLOCATIONS- ONE OF

00:51:53.143 --> 00:51:54.077
THOSE PROJECTS THE TEMPERANCE

00:51:54.144 --> 00:51:55.378
FLAT PROJECT HAS SINCE

00:51:55.445 --> 00:51:57.581
WITHDRAWN FROM FROM THE PROGRAM

00:51:57.647 --> 00:51:58.849
I THINK BECAUSE IT WASN'T ABLE

00:51:58.915 --> 00:52:01.084
TO. IDENTIFY SUFFICIENT OTHER

00:52:01.151 --> 00:52:02.819
FUNDING TO MATCH THE STATE

00:52:02.886 --> 00:52:04.654
PLANS SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS

00:52:04.721 --> 00:52:06.823
THERE IS SOME FUNDING THEIR

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:07.991
MOST MOST OF THOSE FUNDS HAS

00:52:08.058 --> 00:52:10.260
BEEN- AT LEAST INITIALLY

00:52:10.327 --> 00:52:12.462
ALLOCATED BY- THE WATER

00:52:12.529 --> 00:52:13.964
COMMISSION FOR SPECIFIC STORAGE

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:15.131
PROJECTS BUT MY UNDERSTANDING

00:52:15.198 --> 00:52:16.132
IS THERE IS SOMETHING I THINK

00:52:16.199 --> 00:52:18.168
IT'S ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND

00:52:18.235 --> 00:52:19.236
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THAT

00:52:19.302 --> 00:52:21.238
BALLPARK. HAT WAS INITIALLY

00:52:21.304 --> 00:52:22.839
DEDICATED FOR TEMPERANCE FLAT

00:52:22.906 --> 00:52:25.275
THAT NOW- HE'S WAITING FOR THE

00:52:25.342 --> 00:52:27.544
WATER COMMISSION TO DEDICATE TO

00:52:27.611 --> 00:52:28.912
IT TO A DIFFERENT PROJECT

00:52:28.979 --> 00:52:30.514
EITHER ONE OF THE EFFORT TO ADD

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:31.281
TO THAT ONE ANY OTHER ONES

00:52:31.348 --> 00:52:32.849
THEY'VE ALREADY. SET ASIDE

00:52:32.916 --> 00:52:34.217
FUNDING FOR OR FOR A NEW

00:52:34.284 --> 00:52:36.386
PROJECT. THERE WASN'T ANY

00:52:36.453 --> 00:52:41.191
FUNDING IN PROPOSITION. SIXTY

00:52:41.258 --> 00:52:41.725
IT SPECIFICALLY FOR WATER

00:52:41.791 --> 00:52:42.592
STORAGE. IT WOULD YOU BE IN A-

00:52:42.659 --> 00:52:46.263
TO ALLOW. YOU KNOW WHAT- IN

00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:48.665
YOUR PERSPECTIVE- IS. THE HOLD

00:52:48.732 --> 00:52:50.667
UP ON THESE PROJECTS AND YELLED

00:52:50.734 --> 00:52:53.937
THE- PROS AND CONS OF NOT

00:52:54.004 --> 00:52:56.406
MOVING THESE PROJECTS AND JUST

00:52:56.473 --> 00:53:01.478
SITTING ON THIS ON THESE BONDS.

00:53:01.545 --> 00:53:03.179
YEAH I MEAN IT PARTICULARLY IF

00:53:03.246 --> 00:53:04.714
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW

00:53:04.781 --> 00:53:07.450
THE NEW DAM FOR RAISING THE DAM

00:53:07.517 --> 00:53:09.286
AND THEY THOSE ARE VERY BIG

00:53:09.352 --> 00:53:10.587
INVOLVED PROJECTS THAT TAKE A

00:53:10.654 --> 00:53:14.257
LONG TIME SO- YOU KNOW IDEA I

00:53:14.324 --> 00:53:17.060
AM NOT FAMILIAR ENOUGH WITH ANY

00:53:17.127 --> 00:53:19.362
OF THEM TO- OPINAR COMMENT ON

00:53:19.429 --> 00:53:21.264
WHETHER THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES

00:53:21.331 --> 00:53:22.666
THAT HAVE COME OUT BESIDES JUST

00:53:22.732 --> 00:53:24.434
THE- LONG TERM NATURE OF SOME

00:53:24.501 --> 00:53:27.571
OF THE BIG PROJECTS- I THINK.

00:53:27.637 --> 00:53:29.606
JUST ONE COMMENT TO MAKE IS

00:53:29.673 --> 00:53:31.908
THAT THE LEGISLATURE CANNOT RE

00:53:31.975 --> 00:53:33.376
ALLOCATE THAT MANY OR RE

00:53:33.443 --> 00:53:35.045
APPROPRIATED FOR ANYTHING ELSE

00:53:35.111 --> 00:53:37.847
BECAUSE OF HOW THE BOND A

00:53:37.914 --> 00:53:40.283
TO VOTERS IT REALLY IS- IN. THE

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:42.252
WAY THE BOND WAS STRUCTURED UP

01:01:37.627 --> 01:01:39.162
WARMING IN THE CLIMATE SYSTEM

01:01:39.228 --> 01:01:40.630
THAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING

01:01:40.696 --> 01:01:41.297
THERE'S REALLY BEEN A

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:43.533
NOTICEABLE CHANGE SINCE IN THIS

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:45.701
CENTURY AS COMPARED TO DROUGHTS

01:01:45.768 --> 01:01:48.204
IN PRIOR CENTURIES. WITH THE

01:01:48.271 --> 01:01:50.573
IMPACT OF WARMING CONDITIONS-

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.776
LOWER RUNOFF EFFICIENCY FACTOR

01:01:53.843 --> 01:01:56.045
MEANING THAT EVEN IF WE GET A

01:01:56.112 --> 01:01:59.982
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF. RAINFALL

01:02:00.049 --> 01:02:01.050
LITTLE BETTER THAN AVERAGE

01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:02.418
LET'S SAY IN THE NEXT WATER

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:04.087
YEAR WE MAY STILL BE DEALING

01:02:04.153 --> 01:02:06.089
WITH DRY CONDITIONS IN THE NEXT

01:02:06.155 --> 01:02:09.025
YEAR BECAUSE MORE WATER IS-

01:02:09.092 --> 01:02:10.927
BEING LOST TO THE SYSTEM AND

01:02:10.993 --> 01:02:12.995
THEREFORE WE REALLY DO HAVE TO

01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:15.364
PROACTIVELY PLANNED FOR. WHAT

01:02:15.431 --> 01:02:17.700
IF NEXT YEAR IS DRY SOME OF THE

01:02:17.767 --> 01:02:19.402
THINGS THAT WE AT D. W. R. HAVE

01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:21.604
BEEN DOING- ON THE STATE WATER

CAME IN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF

01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:05.935
SITE INSPECTIONS AND WHILE

POPULAR WORD IN SOME AREAS-

01:05:10.473 --> 01:05:11.974
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT COMPONENT

01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:14.176
IN MAKING SURE THAT- THE

01:05:14.243 --> 01:05:15.645
STATE'S WATER RATES SYSTEM IS

THE STATE INCLUDING THE RUSSIAN

01:05:49.812 --> 01:05:51.914
RIVER. WE ALSO ADOPTED A NUMBER

OF VERY SUCCESSFUL INSTREAM

01:05:53.683 --> 01:05:55.484
FLOW EMERGENCY REGULATIONS

01:05:55.551 --> 01:05:57.386
THESE WERE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON

01:05:57.453 --> 01:05:59.288
AN ADDRESS FISH HABITAT IN

01:05:59.355 --> 01:06:01.157
MIDDLE DEER AND ANTELOPE CREEK

01:06:01.223 --> 01:06:02.058
WHICH ARE TRIBUTARIES TO THE

SMALL TRIBUTARIES TO THE

01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:08.764
RUSSIAN RIVER. AND THESE WERE

01:06:08.831 --> 01:06:10.299
SUCCESSFUL IN ENSURING KIND OF

01:06:10.366 --> 01:06:12.101
MINIMAL WHAT WE SOMETIMES

01:06:12.168 --> 01:06:13.569
REFERRED TO AS BELLY SCRAPING

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:15.204
FLOWS TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:16.772
JUST ENOUGH WATER TO. HELP

A OF A FISH. AND ALTHOUGH I'D

01:06:25.848 --> 01:06:27.350
IT WAS NOT DIRECTLY WITHIN THE

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:28.818
DIVISION OF WATER RIGHTS THAT

01:06:28.884 --> 01:06:30.820

RESULTED IN APPROXIMATELY 25%

01:06:37.893 --> 01:06:39.428
REDUCTION IN OVERALL WATER

01:06:39.495 --> 01:06:41.831
DIVERSIONS FROM SERVICE DELTA

WATERS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

01:06:43.699 --> 01:06:45.468
SUCCESSES IT HIGHLIGHTED THE

01:06:45.534 --> 01:06:47.403
NOTICES OF WATER UNAVAILABILITY

01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:49.472
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN ABOUT

01:06:49.538 --> 01:06:51.440
FORTY YEARS THAT THE DIVISION

01:06:51.507 --> 01:06:53.342
HEAD ISSUED THAT SCOPE AND

01:06:53.409 --> 01:06:57.146
SCALE OF. CURTAILMENT NOTICES-

01:06:57.213 --> 01:06:58.814
THAT WAS A SIGNIFICANT LIFT FOR

01:06:58.881 --> 01:07:00.750
THE DIVISION BUT ULTIMATELY ONE

01:07:00.816 --> 01:07:02.718
THAT WAS FAIRLY SUCCESSFUL.

01:07:02.785 --> 01:07:05.087
EMERGENCY INSTREAM REGULATIONS

01:07:05.154 --> 01:07:07.390
WERE ALSO SUCCESSFUL AND- THE

01:07:07.456 --> 01:07:08.691
NUMBER OF ENFORCEMENT

01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:10.292
INSPECTIONS OVER TWO YEAR TIME

01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:13.963
PERIOD WE DID ABOUT. A TWENTY

01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.530
TWO HUNDRED INSPECTIONS AND

01:07:14.597 --> 01:07:16.399
SITE VISITS COMPARED TO A

01:07:16.465 --> 01:07:18.467
NORMAL YEAR WHERE WE MIGHT HAVE

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:20.503
BETWEEN FIFTY AND ONE HUNDRED-

01:07:20.569 --> 01:07:21.871
THAT CAME WITH ADDITIONAL STAFF

01:07:21.937 --> 01:07:23.906
RESOURCES TO HELP US DO THAT.

01:07:23.973 --> 01:07:26.509
IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT LIFT BUT

01:07:26.575 --> 01:07:29.178
ULTIMATELY HI. PERFECTIVE IN

01:07:29.245 --> 01:07:30.679
ENSURING THAT THE BOARD'S

01:07:30.746 --> 01:07:33.282
CURTAILMENT NOTICES WERE

01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:34.583
FOLLOWED OR OBSERVED. WE ALSO

01:07:34.650 --> 01:07:36.085
HAD A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES IN

01:07:36.152 --> 01:07:36.852
SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES

01:07:36.919 --> 01:07:38.888
CONTINUE HI SACRAMENTO RIVER

01:07:38.954 --> 01:07:40.122
TEMPERATURE WAS A CHALLENGING

01:07:40.189 --> 01:07:41.757
THE PREVIOUS DROUGHT. I THINK

01:07:41.824 --> 01:07:44.393
IT REMAINS A BIT OF A CHALLENGE

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:46.429
THIS YEAR AS WELL ALTHOUGH. THE

01:07:46.495 --> 01:07:48.063
COORDINATION AND COMMUNICATION

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:49.298
BETWEEN OUR STATE AND FEDERAL

01:07:49.365 --> 01:07:51.667
PARTNERS. HAS MARKEDLY IMPROVED

01:07:51.734 --> 01:07:53.702
AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE

01:07:53.769 --> 01:07:55.571
TO WORK WITH THE- US BUREAU OF

HI AND IT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.028
IN KIND OF LONG TERM ISSUES

01:08:19.094 --> 01:08:20.763
THAT WE'VE WE'VE NOTED IN THE

TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS AFTER IT WAS

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.441
ACTUALLY DIVERTED WHICH RAISES

01:08:32.508 --> 01:08:34.777
CHALLENGES FOR HOW TIMELY WE

01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:37.246
CAN KIND OF OBSERVE AND COMPILE

01:08:37.313 --> 01:08:40.783
AND UNDERSTAND WATER USE IN

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:42.885
ACROSS A REAL TIME BASIS. TO

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:44.954
ADDRESS SOME OF THESE JUDGES WE

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.155
RECENTLY DEVELOPED A REPORT

01:08:46.222 --> 01:08:48.924
CALLED THE WATER RIGHTS DROUGHT

01:08:48.991 --> 01:08:50.226
AFTER REVIEW OR WATER REPORT.

NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS TO YOU

01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:55.664
ESSENTIALLY ASK THEM WHAT

01:08:55.731 --> 01:08:56.832
WORKED WELL DURING THE PREVIOUS

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:58.267
DROUGHT WHAT DIDN'T WHAT ARE

01:08:58.334 --> 01:09:00.402
THE AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT. AND

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:02.538
FROM THOSE TWENTY FOLLOWER

01:09:02.605 --> 01:09:03.839
TWENTY FOUR ENTITIES. THERE

01:09:03.906 --> 01:09:07.209
WERE- OVER FIVE HUNDRED UNIQUE

01:09:07.276 --> 01:09:09.278
RECOMMENDATIONS. BUT THEY ALL

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:10.379
KIND OF FELL AND WITHIN FOUR

01:09:10.446 --> 01:09:11.780
BROAD CATEGORIES AVERAGING

01:09:11.847 --> 01:09:13.282
COMMUNICATION WAS CITED BY

01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:15.251
EVERY SINGLE PARTICIPANT. AND

01:09:15.317 --> 01:09:16.385
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT- DIVISION

01:09:16.452 --> 01:09:18.988
IS SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON

01:09:19.054 --> 01:09:21.190
THIS. YEAR AND THIS DROUGHT.

01:09:21.257 --> 01:09:23.192
DATA AND ACCOUNTING WERE ALSO

01:09:23.259 --> 01:09:24.927
IDENTIFIED BY ALMOST EVERY

01:09:24.994 --> 01:09:28.063
PARTICIPANT. AND I'M SITTING

01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:29.865
AREAS WHERE WE COULD SHARE DATA

01:09:29.932 --> 01:09:33.469
EARLIER AND HAVE A BETTER KIND

01:09:33.536 --> 01:09:35.804
OF QAQC DATA. HI THERE WOULD BE

01:09:35.871 --> 01:09:36.972
ONE OF POLICY AND POLICY

01:09:37.039 --> 01:09:37.806
UNCERTAINTIES I THINK THAT

01:09:37.873 --> 01:09:39.608
THOSE STILL REMAIN IN MANY

01:09:39.675 --> 01:09:42.278
RESPECTS- AND THEN ALSO

01:09:42.344 --> 01:09:44.513
COORDINATION JUST BETWEEN. OUR

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:45.748
STATE PARTNERS AND OUR FEDERAL

01:09:45.814 --> 01:09:47.983
PARTNERS AS WELL AND THAT'S

01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:48.984
AGAIN AN AREA THAT WE'RE

01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:51.387
ACTIVELY IMPROVING UPON AND

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:53.389
FOCUSING ON CURRENTLY. I THINK

01:09:53.455 --> 01:09:55.291
WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO

01:09:55.357 --> 01:10:01.130
MY COLLEAGUE DURABLE HEMOS.

01:10:01.196 --> 01:10:02.431
THANK YOU WORK AND THANK YOU MR

01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:04.233
CHAIRMAN- I'M TERRIBLE HIM IS

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:06.101
I'M DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE

01:10:06.168 --> 01:10:06.702
DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER AT

01:10:06.769 --> 01:10:08.637
STATE WATER BOARD. I WANTED TO

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:12.074
FOCUS TODAY- LARGELY ON OUR

01:10:12.141 --> 01:10:14.443
RESPONSE FOR WATER SYSTEMS-

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:15.544
DURING THE LAST DROUGHT THERE

01:10:15.611 --> 01:10:18.013
WERE A LOT OF SYSTEMS THAT

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.416
PERFORMED ADMIRABLY LARGELY ARE

01:10:20.482 --> 01:10:22.418
LARGE SYSTEMS WE HAVE FOUR

01:10:22.484 --> 01:10:24.019
HUNDRED WATER SYSTEMS THAT WE-

01:10:24.086 --> 01:10:24.887
CONSIDERED TO BE A LARGE

01:10:24.954 --> 01:10:26.355
DELIVER THE BOOK THE WATER TO

01:10:26.422 --> 01:10:27.489
LARGEST POPULATION IN THE

01:10:27.556 --> 01:10:28.991
STATE. HOWEVER WE ALSO HAVE

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:31.760
OVER TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED

01:10:31.827 --> 01:10:32.328
SMALL WATER SYSTEMS IN THE

01:10:32.394 --> 01:10:34.196
STATE- AN INCREDIBLE NUMBER-

01:10:34.263 --> 01:10:35.331
AND THEY RANGE IN A LOT OF

01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:37.032
DIVERSITY- MANY OF THEM UNDER

01:10:37.099 --> 01:10:38.968
RESOURCE AND OR DISADVANTAGED

01:10:39.034 --> 01:10:40.903
COMMUNITIES. AND THEY AS A MISS

01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:42.771
OVERSTATED OFTEN SUFFER THE

01:10:42.838 --> 01:10:43.872
MOST AND I CONDITIONS LIKE

01:10:43.939 --> 01:10:46.508
THESE. SO FOCUSING ON THE

01:10:46.575 --> 01:10:47.343
LESSONS WE LEARNED FROM THE

01:10:47.409 --> 01:10:49.345
LAST DROUGHT. OF FOUR KIND OF

01:10:49.411 --> 01:10:51.213
AREAS I WANTED TO TOUCH ON ONE

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:53.182
OF THEM IS WERE THIS YEAR UNDER

01:10:53.248 --> 01:10:54.583
THIS CONDITIONS STARTING TO

01:10:54.650 --> 01:10:55.517
PERFORM EARLY ASSESSMENTS

01:10:55.584 --> 01:10:57.720
ASSOCIATED WITH HOW THE WATER

01:10:57.786 --> 01:10:59.922
SYSTEMS ARE PERFORMING-

01:10:59.989 --> 01:11:02.291
SPECIFICALLY WELL MONITORING

01:11:02.358 --> 01:11:04.293
UNDERSTANDING THE LEVELS OF

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.195
WATER IN THEIR WELLS SO THAT

01:11:06.261 --> 01:11:08.464
WE- CAN. ADDRESS THE SITUATION

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:09.865
BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE DRY

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:11.834
WELLS ON THEIR HANDS AND- MAYBE

01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:14.069
EVEN UP YOU KNOW PULLED ERA TO

01:11:14.136 --> 01:11:15.237
THE PUMPS AND DAMAGED EQUIPMENT

01:11:15.304 --> 01:11:16.872
WHICH OBVIOUSLY CREATES A MUCH

01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:18.307
MORE CATASTROPHIC FAILURE THAN

01:11:18.374 --> 01:11:20.676
JUST ON THE WATER FLOWS. AND SO

01:11:20.743 --> 01:11:21.910
ON THAT ALONG WITH

01:11:21.977 --> 01:11:24.246
UNDERSTANDING OF WATER SYSTEMS

01:11:24.313 --> 01:11:25.581
A CALL FROM RESERVOIRS AND HAVE

01:11:25.648 --> 01:11:26.849
IN TAKES IN THOSE RESERVOIRS

01:11:26.915 --> 01:11:28.817
MANY SMALL SYSTEMS DO THAT- AND

01:11:28.884 --> 01:11:30.486
IT'S NOT THE DRESS OR HAS TO GO

01:11:30.552 --> 01:11:32.321
INTO BEFORE THEIR INTAKE IS

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:34.156
ABOVE THE WATER SURFACE. AND

01:11:34.223 --> 01:11:35.724
SUB MONITORING THE LEVEL AS

01:11:35.791 --> 01:11:38.060
RESERVOIRS ARE MOVED DOWN AND

01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:39.128
THEY'RE GREATLY DEPLETED THIS

01:11:39.194 --> 01:11:41.363
YEAR I'M COMING INTO THIS THIS

01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:43.298
IS YOUR AT THE END OF THE-

01:11:43.365 --> 01:11:45.534
SEASON SO- IT'S SUPER CRITICAL

01:11:45.601 --> 01:11:46.535
THAT WE BE ABLE TO MONITOR

01:11:46.602 --> 01:11:48.871
THOSE AND ANTICIPATE. AT A TIME

01:11:48.937 --> 01:11:49.972
BEFORE GOING TO NEED TO TAKE

01:11:50.039 --> 01:11:51.373
EMERGENCY ACTIONS ALONG THE

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:58.380
WATER SYSTEM. TO TRY TO MAKE

01:11:58.447 --> 01:11:58.981
SURE THAT THEY MAINTAIN THEIR

01:11:59.048 --> 01:11:59.481
WATER FLOW. I KNOW VERY

01:11:59.548 --> 01:12:00.115
IMPORTANT THAT WE SAW THE LAST

01:12:00.182 --> 01:12:01.850
WAS DOMESTIC WILL FAILURES. AND

01:12:01.917 --> 01:12:03.652
WE HAVE ALREADY. THERE INCREASE

01:12:03.719 --> 01:12:06.522
THE TECH ASSISTANCE. OUR MONEY

01:12:06.588 --> 01:12:07.723
THAT WE PROVIDE TO SEVERAL OF

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:10.359
OUR- NON GOVERNMENTAL PARTNERS

01:12:10.426 --> 01:12:11.627
THAT WORK IN THIS SPACE WITH

01:12:11.694 --> 01:12:13.962
US. TO ASSIST PRIVATE DOMESTIC

01:12:14.029 --> 01:12:16.265
WELL OWNERS AND SO THAT PROGRAM

01:12:16.331 --> 01:12:18.367
IS- GETTING READY TO TAKE OFF

01:12:18.434 --> 01:12:20.502
AS I'M SURE. WE HAPPEN WE STILL

01:12:20.569 --> 01:12:22.204
HAVE DRY WELLS FROM THE LAST

01:12:22.271 --> 01:12:24.573
DROUGHT WATER SYSTEMS THAT. ARE

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:25.541
INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE DOMESTIC

01:12:25.607 --> 01:12:27.342
WELLS IS NOT RECOVERED AND ARE

01:12:27.409 --> 01:12:28.677
STILL IN THE PROGRAM AND THE

01:12:28.744 --> 01:12:30.112
PROGRAM IS BASICALLY CONTINUE

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:32.347
TO RUN AND OUR JUST. AMPING IT

01:12:32.414 --> 01:12:33.549
UP A LITTLE BIT MORE TO.

01:12:33.615 --> 01:12:36.518
ANTICIPATED INCREASE THERE

01:12:36.585 --> 01:12:38.987
UNFORTUNATELY. THIRDLY IS-

01:12:39.054 --> 01:12:39.922
WATER QUALITY OF STAND BY

01:12:39.988 --> 01:12:43.692
WELLS. DURING THE INTERIM-PERIOD BETWEEN THE DROUGHTS

01:12:43.759 --> 01:12:45.994
WE'VE HAD SEVERAL NEW. MAXIMUM

01:12:46.061 --> 01:12:48.731
CONTAMINANT LEVELS UP AND OTHER

01:12:48.797 --> 01:12:50.833
CONTAMINATING EVENTS COME INTO

01:12:50.899 --> 01:12:52.468
PLAY THAT WEREN'T IN THE LAST

01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:54.803
DROUGHT SPECIFICALLY ONE TWO

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:56.638
THREE T. C. P. HAS IMPACT AND

01:12:56.705 --> 01:12:58.607
IMPACT A LARGE NUMBER OF

01:12:58.674 --> 01:12:59.408
DRINKING WATER WELLS IN THE SAN

01:12:59.475 --> 01:13:01.276
JOAQUIN VALLEY- AND SOME IN

01:13:01.343 --> 01:13:02.945
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND THEN

01:13:03.011 --> 01:13:04.146
WE HAVE THE P. FAST

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:06.248
CONTAMINATION AS WELL THERE'S

01:13:06.315 --> 01:13:07.282
NOT A REGULATORY LIMIT THERE

01:13:07.349 --> 01:13:09.084
BUT- THERE IS LEGISLATION ABOUT

01:13:09.151 --> 01:13:11.086
PUBLIC NOTIFICATION AND MOST

01:13:11.153 --> 01:13:13.222
WATER SYSTEMS ARE TRYING TO

01:13:13.288 --> 01:13:14.890
LIMIT THEIR OUR POPULATIONS

01:13:14.957 --> 01:13:16.391
EXPOSURE TO THOSE CHEMICALS BY

01:13:16.458 --> 01:13:18.694
TAKING WHILE OFFLINE. CHANNELS

01:13:18.761 --> 01:13:20.629
ARE NOT SERVING THAT WATER BUT

01:13:20.696 --> 01:13:21.930
OF COURSE REMOVES A RESOURCE

01:13:21.997 --> 01:13:24.733
THAT THEY WERE COUNTING ON

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:25.367
HEADING INTO THIS DROUGHT. AND

01:13:25.434 --> 01:13:26.802
SO ONE OF OUR PRIORITIES HERE

01:13:26.869 --> 01:13:28.470
IS TO MAKE SURE WE COMMUNICATE

01:13:28.537 --> 01:13:30.172
WITH WATER SYSTEMS THAT AS THEY

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:32.107
PLAN TO BRING BACK. THOSE TYPE

01:13:32.174 --> 01:13:35.077
OF WELLS- THAT THEY PLANNED NOW

01:13:35.144 --> 01:13:35.577
FOR MAKING SURE THEY'RE

01:13:35.644 --> 01:13:36.712
INSTALLING THE NECESSARY

01:13:36.779 --> 01:13:37.613
TREATMENT TO MAINTAIN WATER

01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:39.248
QUALITY AS THEY BRING THAT

01:13:39.314 --> 01:13:41.350
STAND BY WHILE BACK. AND WE'RE

01:13:41.416 --> 01:13:42.951
COMMITTING TO WORK WITH THEM TO

01:13:43.018 --> 01:13:44.853
MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND PRIORITIZE

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.789
OUR- OUR RESOURCES AS WELL TO

01:13:46.855 --> 01:13:48.223
MAKE SURE WERE PROMOTING THOSE

01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:49.925
IN GETTING THOSE SOURCES BACK

01:13:49.992 --> 01:13:51.960
ONLINE AHEAD OF OTHER WORK THAT

01:13:52.027 --> 01:13:53.562
WE WOULD NORMALLY BE DOING. AND

01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:55.397
FINALLY- ERIC MENTIONED THE

01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:56.732
CURTAILMENT ORDERS THAT

01:13:56.799 --> 01:13:58.634
HAPPENED LAST YEAR. LAST

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:01.970
DROUGHT. PREVIOUSLY WE HAD A

01:14:02.037 --> 01:14:03.939
TWENTY TWO THOSE WHERE WE ISSUE

01:14:04.006 --> 01:14:06.175
A- A COROLLARY BUILDING

01:14:06.241 --> 01:14:07.543
MORATORIUM OR CONNECTION

01:14:07.609 --> 01:14:09.044
MORATORIUM TO MAKE SURE THE

01:14:09.111 --> 01:14:11.380
WATER SYSTEMS ARE NOT ADDING.

01:14:11.446 --> 01:14:13.248
FURTHER CAPACITY DEMANDS.

01:14:13.315 --> 01:14:14.316
BECAUSE THEY'RE UNDER

01:14:14.383 --> 01:14:16.652
CURTAILMENT. AND JUST TRYING TO

01:14:16.718 --> 01:14:18.253
MEET HEALTH AND SAFETY FLOWS.

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.255
OUR PREPARING TO CONTINUE TO DO

01:14:20.322 --> 01:14:22.357
THAT AS WE DID LAST TIME AS-

01:14:22.424 --> 01:14:24.226
CURTAILMENTS ARE NECESSARY AND-

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:26.261
TO FOLLOW THROUGH. AND WITHOUT

01:14:26.328 --> 01:14:30.032
I WILL. IN MY PRESENTATION AND

CURRENT ACTIVITIES THE

01:15:05.801 --> 01:15:06.969
DEPARTMENTS ALREADY ENGAGED IN

01:15:07.035 --> 01:15:10.272
IN RESPONSE THE DRY CONDITIONS

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:10.873
WE'RE EXPERIENCING ACROSS THE

IT TO FISH FEED THE OTHER FISH

01:22:11.793 --> 01:22:13.595
IN THE DELTA. WHICH CREATES A

01:22:13.662 --> 01:22:16.097
PROBLEM FOR PUMPING OUT THE

01:27:46.227 --> 01:27:49.297
THAT WATER STORAGE OF TWENTY

01:27:49.364 --> 01:27:50.031
THIRTY SO TODAY WE'RE TALKING

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:51.232
ABOUT WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM

PAST TROUT. AND HOW WE CAN DO

01:27:53.501 --> 01:27:55.003
BETTER AND WHAT WE SHOULD BE

01:27:55.069 --> 01:27:55.737
DOING BETTER TO PREPARE IN THE

01:27:55.803 --> 01:27:58.072
FUTURE WHATEVER FOR FUTURE

01:27:58.139 --> 01:28:00.208
WATER STORAGE IS. ALREADY FROM

01:28:04.212 --> 01:28:05.747
WHAT CAN THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY

01:28:05.813 --> 01:28:07.782
RIGHT NOW DUE TO STREAMLINED.

01:28:07.849 --> 01:28:09.817
TO BRING THAT UP MUCH SOONER

01:28:09.884 --> 01:28:11.853
MAYES TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SB

01:28:11.919 --> 01:28:13.121
NINE YEARS FROM NOW BEFORE WE

01:28:13.187 --> 01:28:14.355
HAVE THE FIRST SET OF MONIES

01:28:14.422 --> 01:28:16.224
FROM PROP ONE TO COMPLETED

01:28:16.290 --> 01:28:18.526
STORAGE. SO I REALLY THINK WE

01:28:18.593 --> 01:28:20.128
NEED TO. BE THINKING ABOUT AND

01:28:20.194 --> 01:28:22.096
CONSIDERING AS A BODY WHAT WE

01:28:22.163 --> 01:28:23.665
CAN DO TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

01:28:23.731 --> 01:28:25.500

COMPLETION THAT WE COULD BE

01:28:39.347 --> 01:28:49.490
DOING TO HELP YOU. SO I THINK-

01:28:49.557 --> 01:28:51.125
ONE THING I SHOULD POINT OUT

01:28:51.192 --> 01:28:52.694
WAS THAT BOND MONEY WAS

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:55.930
SPECIFICALLY FOR THE- PUBLIC

01:28:55.997 --> 01:28:57.832
BENEFITS SHARE THAT THE STATE

01:28:57.899 --> 01:28:59.600

01:28:59.667 --> 01:29:02.136
PROJECTS REQUIRED ADDITIONAL

01:29:02.203 --> 01:29:04.272
INVESTMENTS BY THE LOCAL PARK-

01:29:04.338 --> 01:29:07.842
SPONSORS. AND AS WE HAVE SEEN

01:29:07.909 --> 01:29:09.043
FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CASE OF

ADDITIONAL FUNDING SOURCES AND

I THINK THAT'S ALSO A CHALLENGE

01:29:19.087 --> 01:29:20.722
HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR THE

01:29:20.788 --> 01:29:23.124
SITES RESERVOIR PROJECT AS WELL

WAS ONLY INTENDED TO BE FOR A

01:29:27.929 --> 01:29:30.364

AS DARREN WHO SPOKE. TO US

01:30:01.329 --> 01:30:03.598
ABOUT PEOPLE US. ON AND SO

01:30:03.664 --> 01:30:05.166
WONDERING IF WE HAVE SOME SORT

01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:07.568
OF INVENTORY OF. HOW BIG THE

01:30:07.635 --> 01:30:09.203
PROBLEM IS HOW MANY WALLS ARE

01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:11.672
BEING TURNED OFF AND- THE COST

01:30:11.739 --> 01:30:15.610
TO. REMEDIATE ARE THOSE LAWS

01:30:15.676 --> 01:30:17.645
WILL TO BRING IT BACK IN.

01:30:17.712 --> 01:30:20.982
ABILIFY GLAD SOME- YEAH WE

01:30:21.048 --> 01:30:22.483
HAVEN'T AND WE HAVE SOME

01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:23.951
ADDITIONAL WORK WERE STILL AND

01:30:24.018 --> 01:30:25.853
WE'RE STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:27.555
WE DO ON OUR STATE BOARD

01:30:27.622 --> 01:30:29.757
WEBSITE HAVE A FAST PACED I'M

01:30:29.824 --> 01:30:30.725
HAPPY TO SEND A LINK TO THE

01:30:30.792 --> 01:30:32.860
COMMITTEE THAT MAPS ALL OF THE-

01:30:32.927 --> 01:30:34.595
DETECTIONS THAT WE HAVE AT THE

01:30:34.662 --> 01:30:35.363
DIFFERENT LEVELS THAT WERE

01:30:35.429 --> 01:30:36.764
DETECTED OUT OF THE LOCATION OF

01:30:36.831 --> 01:30:38.733
THOSE WELLS FOR. FULL

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:40.935
INFORMATION- BUT HONESTLY WE

01:30:41.002 --> 01:30:42.904
HAVEN'T EXPLORED THE FULL EDGE

01:30:42.970 --> 01:30:44.305
OF THE CONTAMINATION SO WE'RE

01:30:44.372 --> 01:30:45.740
STILL TRYING TO DELINEATE SOME

01:30:45.807 --> 01:30:47.642
OF THE BOUNDARIES OF THE PLUMES

01:30:47.708 --> 01:30:50.611
ASSOCIATED WITH IT WE JUST A

01:30:50.678 --> 01:30:51.913
COUPLE MONTHS AGO ISSUED A

01:30:51.979 --> 01:30:53.281
ANOTHER ORDER KIND OF OUR

01:30:53.347 --> 01:30:55.283
BIGGEST HOLE AS IT COMES TO

01:30:55.349 --> 01:30:57.285
UNDERSTANDING P. BASS AND THAT

01:30:57.351 --> 01:30:59.520
IS FOR PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM

01:30:59.587 --> 01:31:01.189
WELLS THAT ARE NEAR AND AROUND

01:31:01.255 --> 01:31:02.590
A DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SITES

01:31:02.657 --> 01:31:05.426
BOTH ACTIVE AND FORMER AND WE

01:31:05.493 --> 01:31:06.561
WILL START GETTING DATA FROM

01:31:06.627 --> 01:31:09.130
THEM IN JULY AND AUGUST. AND

01:31:09.197 --> 01:31:10.965
THEN ALL OF CAN DO QUARTERLY

01:31:11.032 --> 01:31:13.201
MONITORING LIKE THE OTHER

01:31:13.267 --> 01:31:15.403
ORDERS WITH ISSUED AROUND THAT-

01:31:15.469 --> 01:31:16.904
I CAN'T SAY THAT THERE'S BEEN

01:31:16.971 --> 01:31:18.639
BUT THE MOST IMPACT HAS BEEN

01:31:18.706 --> 01:31:20.575
IN- SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN

01:31:20.641 --> 01:31:24.245
ORANGE COUNTY AREA- CORONA YOUR

01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:27.481
BRAIN- THE END OF SEVERAL OF

01:31:27.548 --> 01:31:28.883
THE COMMUNITIES IN ORANGE

01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:31.285
COUNTY WATER DISTRICT AREA SAW

01:31:31.352 --> 01:31:33.287
EXTENSIVE NUMBERS OF WELLS THAT

01:31:33.354 --> 01:31:35.223
WERE IMPACTED I BELIEVE MOST OF

01:31:35.289 --> 01:31:36.757
THOSE COMMUNITIES SWITCHED TO

01:31:36.824 --> 01:31:38.492
SURFACE WATER FROM METROPOLITAN

01:31:38.559 --> 01:31:40.428
WATER DISTRICT TEMPORARILY AND

01:31:40.494 --> 01:31:41.629
ARE ACTIVELY WORKING WITH

01:31:41.696 --> 01:31:42.763
PROJECTS TO TRY TO BRING

01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:44.131
TREATMENT ON TO THEM AND GET

01:31:44.198 --> 01:31:46.400
THEM. BACK IN PLACE OF SANTA

01:31:46.467 --> 01:31:48.369
CLARITA ALSO LIKE FIVE OR SIX

01:31:48.436 --> 01:31:49.837
WELLS IMPACTED SO THERE'S A

01:31:49.904 --> 01:31:51.038
BEGINNING OF IT I DON'T HAVE

01:31:51.105 --> 01:31:52.540
OBVIOUSLY A FINAL NUMBER AND

01:31:52.607 --> 01:31:53.207
WE'RE STILL IN THE

01:31:53.274 --> 01:31:54.842
IVESTIGATION MODE TO CONTINUE

01:31:54.909 --> 01:31:59.947
THAT BUT WERE. HAPPY TO SHARE

01:32:00.014 --> 01:32:00.514
WHAT WE KNOW AT THIS POINT.

01:32:00.581 --> 01:32:01.315
YEAH I AS WE ARE GOING INTO

01:32:01.382 --> 01:32:04.752
DROUGHT THE SWELLS ARE BEING.

01:32:04.819 --> 01:32:06.087
SHUT OFF AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING

01:32:06.153 --> 01:32:07.188
HARD AS OF THE CALIFORNIA TO BE

01:32:07.255 --> 01:32:08.389
MUCH MUCH MORE SUSTAINABLE AND

01:32:08.456 --> 01:32:09.657
RELATE RELY LESS ON THAT

01:32:09.724 --> 01:32:12.293
IMPORTED WATER- BUT I HAVE A

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:13.828
NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE

01:32:13.895 --> 01:32:15.730
TURNED OFF. WELLS AND ARE

01:32:15.796 --> 01:32:17.398
IMPORTING WATER AND CAN'T

01:32:17.465 --> 01:32:20.134
AFFORD THE INFRASTRUCTURE COST-

01:32:20.201 --> 01:32:22.036
TO FOR THAT FOR THE CLEAN UP OF

01:32:22.103 --> 01:32:22.603
THAT PEOPLE'S ON AND IN MY

01:32:22.670 --> 01:32:24.105
COMMUNITY STILL. REALLY

01:32:24.171 --> 01:32:26.073
CONCERNED ABOUT THE RATE PAYERS

01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:27.408
PAYING FOR THAT REALLY

01:32:27.475 --> 01:32:29.076
CONCERNED ABOUT THE INCREASE IN

01:32:29.143 --> 01:32:30.711
WATER RATES WITH THE IMPORTED

01:32:30.778 --> 01:32:32.813
WATER- AND JST THE DROUGHT

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:33.881
SITUATION THOUGH AND SO I JUST

01:32:33.948 --> 01:32:35.650
APPRECIATE THE- THAT YOU

01:32:35.716 --> 01:32:37.551
BROUGHT THAT. FOR TODAY AND I

01:32:37.618 --> 01:32:38.452
WOULD APPRECIATE THAT THIS

01:32:38.519 --> 01:32:40.254
OPERATION AND WE HAVE AN

01:32:40.321 --> 01:32:42.023
INVENTORY OF HOW MANY WALLS ARE

01:32:42.089 --> 01:32:45.793
CURRENTLY OUT. OF USE BECAUSE A

01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:46.761
FEW PEOPLE OFF. YEAH THE CHECK

01:32:46.827 --> 01:32:47.828
AS WE GET MORE DATA ALL THE

01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:50.197
TIME BUT IT'S ON THE ORDER. OF

01:32:50.264 --> 01:32:53.367
OVER. AND OVER- TWO HUNDRED

01:32:53.434 --> 01:32:55.236
WELLS WE NOW HAVE IMPACTS IN

01:32:55.303 --> 01:32:56.771
THE STATE THAT ARE ABOVE OUR

01:32:56.837 --> 01:32:59.307
NOTIFICATION LEVELS AND- THIS

01:32:59.373 --> 01:33:00.341
GRAPHICS ON THE WEB PAGE THAT

01:33:00.408 --> 01:33:01.742
KEEP THAT UPDATED CURRENTLY SO

01:33:01.809 --> 01:33:02.710
WE'LL DEFINITELY GET THAT TO

01:33:02.777 --> 01:33:04.345
YOU. AND YES IT'S A BIG CONCERN

01:33:04.412 --> 01:33:06.213
WE KNOW IT'S- DOUBLY IMPACTFUL

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:08.382
IT IT'S INCREASING RATES AND-

01:33:08.449 --> 01:33:09.817
IT IS A CONTAMINATION ISSUE

01:33:09.884 --> 01:33:11.218
THAT. THE WATER SYSTEMS ARE

01:33:11.285 --> 01:33:16.157
WORKING THROUGH. SO THANK YOU.

01:33:16.223 --> 01:33:18.059
THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

01:33:18.125 --> 01:33:20.428
MISTER BENNETT. THANK YOU I

01:33:20.494 --> 01:33:26.267
HAVE BOB- THREE COMMENT MORE

01:33:26.334 --> 01:33:28.369
THAN QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS FOR

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:31.572
LONG TERM- ITEMS THAT I WOULD

01:33:31.639 --> 01:33:34.542
LIKE TO HAVE- THE WATERS OURS

01:33:34.608 --> 01:33:36.444
IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE

01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:38.579
AGENCY SAID TO LOOK AT AND ONE

01:33:38.646 --> 01:33:40.514
IS. IN TWO DIFFERENT PLACES

01:33:40.581 --> 01:33:44.085
HERE- ON OUR ADAPTIONS TO THE

01:33:44.151 --> 01:33:44.952
LAST DROUGHT WE MAKE REFERENCE

01:33:45.019 --> 01:33:47.455
TO- THE GROUNDWATER

01:33:47.521 --> 01:33:49.390
SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES THAT

01:33:49.457 --> 01:33:51.292
HAVE BEEN CREATED AND I JUST

01:33:51.359 --> 01:33:54.028
WANT TO POINT OUT THAT. THEY

01:33:54.095 --> 01:33:57.131
HAVE TWENTY YEARS TO. REACH

01:33:57.198 --> 01:33:59.800
SUSTAINABILITY AND VERY FEW OF

01:33:59.867 --> 01:34:01.068
THEM ARE MAKING ANY-

01:34:01.135 --> 01:34:04.372
SIGNIFICANT CUTS- THIS EARLY

01:34:04.438 --> 01:34:05.439
THEY'RE JUST GETTING THEIR

01:34:05.506 --> 01:34:07.508
PLANS TOGETHER AND ALMOST ALL

01:34:07.575 --> 01:34:08.509
OF THEM ARE GOING TO HAVE PLANS

01:34:08.576 --> 01:34:11.045
TO CALL FOR A VERY SLOW RAMP

01:34:11.112 --> 01:34:14.382
DOWNS SO WE SHOULDN'T- WE

01:34:14.448 --> 01:34:16.517
SHOULDN'T EXPECT MUCH IN THE IN

01:34:16.584 --> 01:34:19.520
TERMS OF THE SHORT RUN- HELP TO

01:34:19.587 --> 01:34:21.655
COME FROM. GROUNDWATER

01:34:21.722 --> 01:34:23.190
SUSTAINABILITY PLANS THAT HAVE

01:34:23.257 --> 01:34:25.926
A TWENTY YEAR CYCLE BEFORE THEY

01:34:25.993 --> 01:34:28.763
YEAH- ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE

01:34:28.829 --> 01:34:30.865
REACHED A SUSTAINABILITY IF

01:34:30.931 --> 01:34:32.666
THEY'RE IF THEY'RE ABLE TO EVEN

01:34:32.733 --> 01:34:34.602
DO THAT IN TWENTY YEARS. THE

01:34:34.668 --> 01:34:38.339
SECOND THING IS- IT SEEMS THAT

01:34:38.406 --> 01:34:41.275
WE HAVE A LACK OF DATA A BALLOT

01:34:41.342 --> 01:34:46.747
WELLS- AND IT WOULD SEEM THAT.

01:34:46.814 --> 01:34:47.481
ONE THING I'D LIKE TO

01:34:47.548 --> 01:34:49.850
ADMINISTRATION TO CONSIDER- AND

01:34:49.917 --> 01:34:51.419
POTENTIALLY THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:34:51.485 --> 01:34:54.121
SUPPORT IS FUNDING FOR

01:34:54.188 --> 01:34:55.656
MONITORING WELLS THAT WOULD

01:34:55.723 --> 01:34:58.692
GIVE THE STATE- FASTER

01:34:58.759 --> 01:35:00.995
INFORMATION ABOUT POTENTIALLY

01:35:01.062 --> 01:35:03.731
HIGH RISK AREAS AREAS NEAR

01:35:03.798 --> 01:35:05.466
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES LIKE

01:35:05.533 --> 01:35:06.667
CENTER SO THE STATE COULD GET

01:35:06.734 --> 01:35:09.804
RAPID. INFORMATION AND WE JUST

01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:11.272
HAVE LOTS OF AREAS WHERE WE

01:35:11.338 --> 01:35:12.907
JUST DON'T HAVE A GOOD

01:35:12.973 --> 01:35:15.743
MONITORING WELLS- THE END SO

01:35:15.810 --> 01:35:20.381
THAT THAT. WOULD BE THE SECOND

01:35:20.448 --> 01:35:21.015
AND THEN THE FINAL THING IS. WE

01:35:21.082 --> 01:35:24.385
SHOULD BE. ARE FOR A STEADY AND

01:35:24.452 --> 01:35:26.454
MORE SEVERE DROUGHT CYCLES TO

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:28.989
COME AND IF WE'RE GOING TO DO

01:35:29.056 --> 01:35:31.759
THAT I THINK WE HAVE TO BECOME

01:35:31.826 --> 01:35:34.462
MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE- ABOUT

01:35:34.528 --> 01:35:36.697
WHAT WE DO AND I APPRECIATE OF

01:35:36.764 --> 01:35:38.065
MY COLLEAGUES HERE OF TALK

01:35:38.132 --> 01:35:40.801
ABOUT STORAGE- I WOULD SUGGEST

01:35:40.868 --> 01:35:44.238
THAT- THE RECYCLING OF WATER-

01:35:44.305 --> 01:35:48.843
IS. A VERY RIGHT- AREA AND IT

01:35:48.909 --> 01:35:50.711
PARTICULARLY IS RIGHT FOR

01:35:50.778 --> 01:35:53.481
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS- AND I

01:35:53.547 --> 01:35:54.748
THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A

01:35:54.815 --> 01:35:57.818
STATEWIDE PLAN- THAT WOULD

01:35:57.885 --> 01:36:00.654
ENCOURAGE AND BOTH THE SCIENCE

01:36:00.721 --> 01:36:03.357
OF THE TECHNOLOGY FOR. THE

01:36:03.424 --> 01:36:04.859
RECYCLING OF WATER TO

01:36:04.925 --> 01:36:06.727
DRAMATICALLY DECREASE A

01:36:06.794 --> 01:36:11.499
MUNICIPAL- AGENCIES RELIANCE ON

01:36:11.565 --> 01:36:13.567
BOTH IMPORTED WATER AND WATER

01:36:13.634 --> 01:36:16.303
THAT COMES FROM- GROUNDWATER

01:36:16.370 --> 01:36:18.839
SUPPLIES- TO THE WE GET MUCH

01:36:18.906 --> 01:36:20.908
MORE BANG OUT OF THE WATER-

01:36:20.975 --> 01:36:23.777
THAT WE DO- SPEND AN ENORMOUS

01:36:23.844 --> 01:36:25.079
AMOUNT OF MONEY TO TRY TO GET

01:36:25.146 --> 01:36:28.616
INTO OURMUNICIPAL SYSTEMS.

01:36:28.682 --> 01:36:29.750
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU

01:36:29.817 --> 01:36:30.885
MISTER BENNETT WOULD YOU ANY

01:36:30.951 --> 01:36:32.520
THE PALACE LIKE TO COMMENT ON

01:36:32.586 --> 01:36:35.489
ANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES.

01:36:35.556 --> 01:36:41.262
PERSPECTIVES THAT HE'S A SHARK.

01:36:41.328 --> 01:36:42.897
OKAY THIS IS RACHEL EHLERS FROM

01:36:42.963 --> 01:36:44.999
LA- JUST ONE COMMENT- IN

01:36:45.065 --> 01:36:46.267
RESPONSE TO THAT AND IF AND

01:36:46.333 --> 01:36:48.269
ALSO TO THE COMMENT OF THE VICE

01:36:48.335 --> 01:36:50.571
CHAIR JUST- WHEN WE THINK ABOUT

01:36:50.638 --> 01:36:52.473
STORAGE IT'S NOT JUST ABOVE

01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:53.274
GROUND STORAGE IT'S

01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:54.575
HISTORICALLY KIND OF HOW WE

01:36:54.642 --> 01:36:56.644
THOUGHT ABOUT WATER STORAGE BUT

01:36:56.710 --> 01:36:57.745
IT JUST ENCOURAGING THAT

01:36:57.811 --> 01:36:59.547
COMMITTEE TO ALSO CONSIDER

01:36:59.613 --> 01:37:02.216
BELOW GROUND STORAGE- AS AS

01:37:02.283 --> 01:37:04.518
POTENTIALLY PROJECTS THAT COULD

01:37:04.585 --> 01:37:06.053
MOVE FASTER THEIR DAIRY MAYBE

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:08.622
SMALLER- SO THINKING ABOUT

01:37:08.689 --> 01:37:10.291
GROUNDWATER RECHARGE CAPTURING

01:37:10.357 --> 01:37:12.359
FLOOD WATERS- STORM WATER

01:37:12.426 --> 01:37:14.862
CAPTURE. THINK AS MISTER

01:37:14.929 --> 01:37:15.896
BENNETT JUST NOTED HOW CAN WE

01:37:15.963 --> 01:37:18.766
BE AGGRESSIVE AND THINK I THINK

01:37:18.832 --> 01:37:20.701
MORE CREATIVELY SO REALLY

01:37:20.768 --> 01:37:22.069
EXPANDING WHEN WE THINK ABOUT

01:37:22.136 --> 01:37:25.573
WATER STORAGE- AND RESOURCES-

01:37:25.639 --> 01:37:27.107
THAT THAT'S PROBABLY KIND OF

01:37:27.174 --> 01:37:28.342
THE NEXT FRONTIER THAT WE

01:37:28.409 --> 01:37:29.543
SHOULD REALLY BE THINKING ABOUT

01:37:29.610 --> 01:37:31.312

IN THE STATE OR- A LINING- WITH

01:39:04.872 --> 01:39:06.874
THE FUNDS THAT ARE COMING FROM.

01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:08.609
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- TO-

01:39:08.676 --> 01:39:10.844
TACKLE THE INITIAL PHASE OF

01:39:10.911 --> 01:39:12.513
THIS TRIAL TO AVOID ANOTHER SEC

01:39:12.579 --> 01:39:14.114
THREE QUESTIONS I WANT. ANY OF

01:39:14.181 --> 01:39:21.121
THE PANELISTS- CAN. TRY TO.

01:39:21.188 --> 01:39:22.923
ADDRESS THAT PLEASE. WELL ON

01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:25.626
ALL TAKE A US THAT I THINK-

01:39:25.693 --> 01:39:27.928
VISITORS MADE A- POINT IN HER.

01:39:27.995 --> 01:39:29.863
OPENING REMARKS ABOUT THE

01:39:29.930 --> 01:39:32.132
DISTINCTION BETWEEN SHORT TERM

01:39:32.199 --> 01:39:34.234
DROUGHT RESPONSE PROJECT AND

01:39:34.301 --> 01:39:36.537
THE LARGE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE

01:39:36.603 --> 01:39:38.739
PROJECTS THAT TAKE LONGER TO

01:39:38.806 --> 01:39:40.808
PUT INTO PLACE THE NATURE OF

01:39:40.874 --> 01:39:42.843
THOSE LARGE PROJECTS IS SUCH

01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:45.212
THAT. IT YOU KNOW THEY CAN BE

01:39:45.279 --> 01:39:48.015
ON A- FOUR YEAR FIVE YEAR TEN

01:39:48.082 --> 01:39:49.783
YEAR PLANNING HORIZON-

01:39:49.850 --> 01:39:51.785
HOPEFULLY MUCH LONGER THAN THE-

01:39:51.852 --> 01:39:53.854
SPAN OF OUR NEXT DROUGHT. YET

01:39:53.921 --> 01:39:55.289
THEY ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN THE

01:39:55.356 --> 01:39:57.391
LONG TERM BECAUSE WE EXPECT

01:39:57.458 --> 01:39:58.792
CALIFORNIA TO BE FACING A

01:39:58.859 --> 01:40:00.661
FUTURE IN WHICH WE SEE THE

01:40:00.728 --> 01:40:03.030
EFFECTS OF A WARMING CLIMATE

01:40:03.097 --> 01:40:05.666
AND CONSEQUENTLY- A GREATER

01:40:05.733 --> 01:40:07.801
RISK OF WATER SCARCITY. SO

01:40:07.868 --> 01:40:09.603
YOU'RE TURNING TO THE THINGS

01:40:09.670 --> 01:40:12.005
THAT CAN BE DONE IN THE SHORT

01:40:12.072 --> 01:40:14.074
TERM THE NEAR TERM. THE

01:40:14.141 --> 01:40:16.677
CERTAINLY- OF MUCH OF THAT IS

01:40:16.744 --> 01:40:18.512
THE DATA AND FORECASTING AREA

01:40:18.579 --> 01:40:20.748
AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE SOME IDEAS

01:40:20.814 --> 01:40:23.183
OF WHAT CAN BE IMPROVED THERE

01:40:23.250 --> 01:40:24.451
AND ALSO IN THE NEAR TERM

01:40:24.518 --> 01:40:26.387
ASSISTANCE TO US SMALL WATER

01:40:26.453 --> 01:40:28.989
SYSTEMS. THAT DOES TEND TO

01:40:29.056 --> 01:40:31.492
STRUGGLE DURING DROUGHT THE-

01:40:31.558 --> 01:40:33.494
SAFER PROGRAM THAT THE LEDGER

01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:34.962
LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED A COUPLE

01:40:35.028 --> 01:40:37.598
OF YEARS AGO IS A GREAT STEP

01:40:37.664 --> 01:40:40.300
FORWARD IN THAT REGARD- AS ARE

01:40:40.367 --> 01:40:42.569
SOME OF THE- RECOMMENDATIONS

01:40:42.636 --> 01:40:44.471
FOR. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND

01:40:44.538 --> 01:40:46.807
OTHER DIRECT ASSISTANCE THAT WE

01:40:46.874 --> 01:40:48.809
HAVE IN OUR REPORT TO THE

01:40:48.876 --> 01:40:51.078
LEGISLATURE ON THE DROUGHT

01:40:51.145 --> 01:40:53.280
VULNERABILITY OF SMALL HANDOUT

01:40:53.347 --> 01:40:55.082
RURAL COMMUNITIES. SO I THINK

01:40:55.149 --> 01:40:57.084
WE CERTAINLY HAVE SOME PASSED

01:40:57.151 --> 01:40:59.319
FORWARD TO BE GOING DOWN AND IN

01:40:59.386 --> 01:41:01.455
OF THE RISK OF DROUGHT IS NOT

01:41:01.522 --> 01:41:03.690
GOING TO GO AWAY IF ANYTHING WE

01:41:03.757 --> 01:41:09.029
WOULD EXPECT- PROBABLY. A

01:41:09.096 --> 01:41:09.563
WORSENING IN THE LONG TERM

01:41:09.630 --> 01:41:11.965
FUTURE. ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO THE

01:41:12.032 --> 01:41:13.100
TAKE A STAB AT THE- THE

01:41:13.167 --> 01:41:16.770
QUESTIONS. SURE I CAN READ IN

01:41:16.837 --> 01:41:18.705
THE SIGNATURE DOUBLE THE PARK

01:41:18.772 --> 01:41:20.140
THIS WHILE I'VE- YOU KNOW AS I

01:41:20.207 --> 01:41:21.775
MENTIONED WE ARE WE'RE ACTIVELY

01:41:21.842 --> 01:41:23.110
ENGAGED IN IN STARTING

01:41:23.177 --> 01:41:24.878
CONVERSATIONS WE DEVELOP WITCHY

01:41:24.945 --> 01:41:26.580
RETURN EARLY TO START. TALKING

01:41:26.647 --> 01:41:27.948
ABOUT IT AND REGULARLY

01:41:28.015 --> 01:41:29.416
COMMUNICATING ON ISSUES WE'RE

01:41:29.483 --> 01:41:31.218
SEEING ACROSS THE STATE WE'VE

01:41:31.285 --> 01:41:32.686
FAR START SOME CONVERSATIONS IN

01:41:32.753 --> 01:41:34.421
THE RUSSIAN- WE'RE WORKING WITH

01:41:34.488 --> 01:41:35.956
THE WATER BOARD ANOTHER SHOULD

01:41:36.023 --> 01:41:36.824
BE CHANGED TO BEGIN

01:41:36.890 --> 01:41:38.425
CONVERSATIONS ARE SORT OF LAST

01:41:38.492 --> 01:41:39.593
TIME TO START LOOKING AT.

01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:40.928
PARTNERSHIPS WE CAN CREATE

01:41:40.994 --> 01:41:42.763
ABOUT HOW IN TRYING TO ENSURE

01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:45.732
FLOWS CAN BE MODIFIED OR OR

01:41:45.799 --> 01:41:47.201
JUST TO INSURE PROTECTION THE

01:41:47.267 --> 01:41:49.002
SPECIES WERE MONITORING SOME

01:41:49.069 --> 01:41:51.004
STRINGS ALREADY FOR- FISH

01:41:51.071 --> 01:41:55.709
STRANDING- DUE. TO LOW FLOW

01:41:55.776 --> 01:41:56.743
CONDITIONS. RIGHT ON THE

01:41:56.810 --> 01:41:58.812
HATCHERY AS WE TALKED ABOUT IT

01:41:58.879 --> 01:42:00.013
THE TRUCK BECAUSE FISH SO. WE

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:01.748
ARE ACTIVELY. I WOULD NEVER SAY

01:42:01.815 --> 01:42:02.983
WERE TOTALLY PREPARED BECAUSE

01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:04.084
WE NEVER KNOW REALLY WHERE

01:42:04.151 --> 01:42:05.786
WE'RE GOING. BUT WE'RE DOING

01:42:05.853 --> 01:42:07.187
EVERYTHING WE CAN BASED ON WHAT

01:42:07.254 --> 01:42:09.223
WE LEARN- IN THE RECENT PAST TO

01:42:09.289 --> 01:42:10.524
PREPARE OURSELVES FOR WHAT'S

01:42:10.591 --> 01:42:12.259
AHEAD OF US AND TO MAKE SURE

01:42:12.326 --> 01:42:13.727
THAT WE CAN RESPOND TO THAT WE

01:42:13.794 --> 01:42:15.229
ARE RESPONDING. AND WORKING

01:42:15.295 --> 01:42:15.963
WITH ALL THE PARTIES AND WE

01:42:16.029 --> 01:42:17.664
NEED TO AS WE CONTINUE TO LEARN

01:42:17.731 --> 01:42:20.133
MORE MORE ABOUT SO HOW DARBY

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:23.604
MAY OR MAY NOT BE MOVING INTO

01:42:23.670 --> 01:42:24.137
THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS OF

01:42:24.204 --> 01:42:26.740
POTENTIALLY THE NEXT YEAR.

01:42:26.807 --> 01:42:28.909
MISTER CHAIR AYE AYE DODD- YOUR

01:42:28.976 --> 01:42:31.578
QUESTIONS AS WELL FOCUSING ON.

01:42:31.645 --> 01:42:34.948
DRINKING WATER ASPECTS. THAT I

01:42:35.015 --> 01:42:35.983
DO FEEL LIKE WE'RE MOVING THE

01:42:36.049 --> 01:42:37.551
NEEDLE THE- GOVERNOR AND THE

01:42:37.618 --> 01:42:39.019
LEGISLATURE DID PASS THE SAVE A

01:42:39.086 --> 01:42:40.320
FORMAL DRINKING WATER ACT AND

01:42:40.387 --> 01:42:41.955
BROUGHT. ON OUR SUPER PROGRAM

01:42:42.022 --> 01:42:44.057
AS MICELLAR MENTIONED- THERE'S

01:42:44.124 --> 01:42:45.225
A LOT OF WORK REALLY STARTING

01:42:45.292 --> 01:42:47.094
UP THERE. THE SMALLER WATER

01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:48.328
SYSTEMS ARE THE ONE THAT ARE

01:42:48.395 --> 01:42:49.897
IMPACTED AS MICELLAR MENTION AS

01:42:49.963 --> 01:42:52.432
WELL. AND WE'RE REALLY WORKING

01:42:52.499 --> 01:42:53.500
HARD TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:42:53.567 --> 01:42:55.836
WE- ADDRESS THAT. A LOT OF THAT

01:42:55.903 --> 01:42:57.938
WILL BE COMBINING WATER SYSTEMS

01:42:58.005 --> 01:42:59.439
OF THE- THE AGE OF A SMALL

01:42:59.506 --> 01:43:01.308
INDEPENDENT LITTLE WATER SYSTEM

01:43:01.375 --> 01:43:02.242
WITH ONE WHILE SURVIVING THE

01:43:02.309 --> 01:43:04.278
DROUGHT. IS PROBABLY A THING OF

01:43:04.344 --> 01:43:06.179
THE PAST AND HOW WE HARDEN THEM

01:43:06.246 --> 01:43:07.581
AND PREPARE THOSE COMMUNITIES

01:43:07.648 --> 01:43:10.517
FOR. THEIR FUTURE IS- IMPORTANT

01:43:10.584 --> 01:43:11.418
WE'RE WORKING REALLY HARD IN

01:43:11.485 --> 01:43:13.120
THAT AREA- TO MOVE THAT

01:43:13.186 --> 01:43:15.022
FORWARD. IT DID REALLY GET

01:43:15.088 --> 01:43:16.790
ASKED ALL THROUGHOUT AS WELL

01:43:16.857 --> 01:43:18.158
OUR DEPARTMENT AND MY GROUP IS

01:43:18.225 --> 01:43:20.961
WORKING ON DIRECT POTABLE REUSE

01:43:21.028 --> 01:43:22.696
FOR RECYCLED WATER REGULATIONS.

01:43:22.763 --> 01:43:24.097
THAT'LL BE NEW IN CALIFORNIA

01:43:24.164 --> 01:43:25.332
AND SEVERAL OF OUR LARGE WATER

01:43:25.399 --> 01:43:26.400
AGENCIES IN SOUTHERN

01:43:26.466 --> 01:43:28.068
CALIFORNIA. AND EVENTUALLY

01:43:28.135 --> 01:43:29.036
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WILL

01:43:29.102 --> 01:43:30.537
CONSIDER. HOW TO BRING THAT

01:43:30.604 --> 01:43:32.539
ONLINE AND FURTHER TAKE

01:43:32.606 --> 01:43:35.208
ADVANTAGE OF- RECYCLING IN THE

01:43:35.275 --> 01:43:36.843
STATE. IN THE LAST DROUGHT

01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:38.111
THERE WAS- EIGHT HUNDRED

01:43:38.178 --> 01:43:39.079
MILLION DOLLARS AT THE BOARD

01:43:39.146 --> 01:43:40.714
OFFERED AT A 1% LOAN INTEREST

01:43:40.781 --> 01:43:42.282
RATE THAT WAS SNAPPED UP AND-

01:43:42.349 --> 01:43:43.317
ALL THOSE PROJECTS ARE NOT

01:43:43.383 --> 01:43:45.619
COMPLETED IN CONTRIBUTING. TO

01:43:45.686 --> 01:43:47.387
THE WATER SUPPLY IN CALIFORNIA

01:43:47.454 --> 01:43:48.855
SO WE CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS

01:43:48.922 --> 01:43:50.257
BUT- HISTORICALLY THE

01:43:50.324 --> 01:43:51.158
INVESTMENT IN WATER

01:43:51.224 --> 01:43:53.026
INFRASTRUCTURE. HAS BEEN

01:43:53.093 --> 01:43:54.528
UNDERFUNDED NATIONALLY AND IN

01:43:54.595 --> 01:43:59.266
CALIFORNIA'S NO DIFFERENT. IN

01:43:59.333 --> 01:43:59.833
THAT REGARD AND THERE'S MUCH

01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:00.467
MORE WORK TO DO. I THANK YOU.

01:44:00.534 --> 01:44:02.336
I'VE GOT THAT TO MARK. ONE IN

01:44:02.402 --> 01:44:03.337
THE AREA OF THE WATER

01:44:03.403 --> 01:44:05.072
RESTRICTIONS AT THAT SOME POINT

01:44:05.138 --> 01:44:08.275
ANOTHER. ARE BROUGHT UP UPON

01:44:08.342 --> 01:44:09.209
YOU KNOW OUR WATER AGENCIES ARE

01:44:09.276 --> 01:44:13.246
CITIES- AG INDUSTRY. CURIOUS TO

01:44:13.313 --> 01:44:17.050
KNOW- IF WE ARE PREPARED- AS IT

01:44:17.117 --> 01:44:19.953
COMES TO- IMPOSING THESE

01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:22.656
RESTRICTIONS- REQUIRED

01:44:22.723 --> 01:44:25.025
PERMITTING WATER CHANGES A- NEW

01:44:25.092 --> 01:44:26.093
WATER RIGHT KIND OF

01:44:26.159 --> 01:44:29.229
RECONFIGURATION. TO DO- JUST

01:44:29.296 --> 01:44:32.399
THAT IT'S A LONG PROCESS- ARE

01:44:32.466 --> 01:44:34.635
WE DOING ANYTHING WITHIN THE

01:44:34.701 --> 01:44:37.504
AGENCIES THAT CAN HELP US MOVE

01:44:37.571 --> 01:44:38.639
IT IN A MUCH MORE EXPEDITIOUS

01:44:38.705 --> 01:44:41.842
MANNER- TO TRY TO COMPLY WITH

01:44:41.908 --> 01:44:44.745
THOSE- WATER RESTRICTIONS THAT

01:44:44.811 --> 01:44:47.614
WE BEGIN TO. IMPOSE ACROSS THE

01:44:47.681 --> 01:44:49.750
BOARD ON INDUSTRIES-

01:44:49.816 --> 01:44:51.718
MUNICIPALITIES AND OTHER.

01:44:51.785 --> 01:44:53.086
ENTITIES IS THERE SOMETHING

01:44:53.153 --> 01:44:55.022
THAT WE'RE ALREADY LOOKING AT A

01:44:55.088 --> 01:44:56.857
TO HELP US- POSITION OURSELVES

01:44:56.923 --> 01:44:59.660
TO BE MORE EFFICIENT AT WHEN IT

01:44:59.726 --> 01:45:01.728
COMES TO THOSE RESTRICTIONS.

01:45:01.795 --> 01:45:03.864
THIS IS- ERICA DOG JUMPED IN

01:45:03.930 --> 01:45:06.266
IN- MAYBE OTHERS CAN JOIN AS

01:45:06.333 --> 01:45:09.436
WELL- OF CERTAINTY FROM THE

01:45:09.503 --> 01:45:12.139
WATER RIGHTS PERSPECTIVE AND-

01:45:12.205 --> 01:45:13.907
REFERENCE THAT- CURTAILMENTS

01:45:13.974 --> 01:45:15.742
THAT WE DID BACK IN TWENTY

01:45:15.809 --> 01:45:17.678
FOURTEEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN. WE

01:45:17.744 --> 01:45:20.580
DID HAVE A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES

01:45:20.647 --> 01:45:21.648
IN IMPLEMENTING THOSE.

01:45:21.715 --> 01:45:25.152
CURTAILMENTS AT THAT TIME- IN

01:45:25.218 --> 01:45:26.987
TWENTY FOURTEEN IN PARTICULAR-

01:45:27.054 --> 01:45:28.855
UP UNTIL THAT POINT THE WATER

01:45:28.922 --> 01:45:30.624
RATES YOU STATE OR DEMAND DATA

01:45:30.691 --> 01:45:32.292
WAS ONLYREPORTED EVERY THREE

01:45:32.359 --> 01:45:35.829
YEARS. AND SO IT WAS HARD TO

01:45:35.896 --> 01:45:37.931
GET AN ASSESSMENT OF KIND OF

01:45:37.998 --> 01:45:40.901
WHAT. WAS A REAL TIME DATA WAS.

01:45:40.967 --> 01:45:43.203
LOOKING LIKE THERE WERE

01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:45.405
LEGISLATIVE CHANGES IN TWENTY

01:45:45.472 --> 01:45:46.206
FIFTEEN THAT REQUIRE PEOPLE TO

01:45:46.273 --> 01:45:47.607
REPORT THEIR WATER USE EVERY

01:45:47.674 --> 01:45:49.643
YEAR AND THAT HAS SIGNIFICANTLY

01:45:49.710 --> 01:45:52.979
IMPROVED- HOW OFTEN WE GET THAT

01:45:53.046 --> 01:45:54.581
DATA BUT EVEN STILL THE TIME

01:45:54.648 --> 01:45:56.083
WHEN SUPPORT AS I MENTIONED

01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:57.050
EARLIER ABOUT ONCE EVERY

01:45:57.117 --> 01:45:58.652
EIGHTEEN. MONTHS IN SOME

01:45:58.719 --> 01:46:00.787
CIRCUMSTANCES AND SO THAT'S

01:46:00.854 --> 01:46:01.788
GOING TO LEAD TO THE ON GOING

01:46:01.855 --> 01:46:03.990
CHALLENGES JUST MAKING SURE WE

01:46:04.057 --> 01:46:05.826
HAVE ACCURATE UP TO DATE DATA.

01:46:05.892 --> 01:46:07.561
BUT GIVEN THE IDEA THAT WE DO

01:46:07.627 --> 01:46:09.730
HAVE WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE

01:46:09.796 --> 01:46:11.631
CAN TO COORDINATE IT AND TO

01:46:11.698 --> 01:46:13.300
MAKE SURE THAT. THAT DATA IS

01:46:13.366 --> 01:46:15.068
AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND SO

01:46:15.135 --> 01:46:16.103
JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE OF

01:46:16.169 --> 01:46:17.904
WEEKS THE DIVISION RELEASED A

01:46:17.971 --> 01:46:19.573
SUPPLY DEMAND VISUALIZATION

01:46:19.639 --> 01:46:21.341

01:46:23.844 --> 01:46:25.612
CERTAIN WATERSHED THAT DEMAND

01:46:25.679 --> 01:46:28.014
BASED ON. WHO'S REPORTED WHAT

01:46:28.081 --> 01:46:29.750
WATER USE IN THE PAST AND

01:46:29.816 --> 01:46:31.384
PROJECTED SUPPLY BASED ON SOME

01:46:31.451 --> 01:46:33.220
INFORMATION FROM OUR SISTER

01:46:33.286 --> 01:46:34.688
AGENCIES AND THAT'S A

01:46:34.755 --> 01:46:36.490
SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD. THE

01:46:36.556 --> 01:46:38.058
PURPOSE OF THAT IS TO PROVIDE

01:46:38.125 --> 01:46:39.392
SOME OF THAT INFORMATION

01:46:39.459 --> 01:46:41.328
EARLIER AND MORE OFTEN SO THAT

01:46:41.394 --> 01:46:43.330
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHEN WE ARE

01:46:43.396 --> 01:46:45.298
DRY CONDITION WHAT DO YOU

01:46:45.365 --> 01:46:46.833
SUPPLY DEMAND CONDITIONS LOOK

01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:48.068
LIKE IN ARE WE HEADING TOWARDS

01:46:48.135 --> 01:46:50.437
A POTENTIAL- NEED FOR

01:46:50.504 --> 01:46:52.639
CURTAILMENT SCORER NOTICES THAT

01:46:52.706 --> 01:46:57.277
THERE ISN'T SUFFICIENT. SUPPLY

01:46:57.344 --> 01:46:58.879
RELATIVE TO DEMAND- THERE WAS

01:46:58.945 --> 01:47:01.748
ALSO I THINK- I'D IT TO ENSURE

01:47:01.815 --> 01:47:03.116
THE QUESTIONS REFER TO SOME OF

01:47:03.183 --> 01:47:05.152
THE- BEEN WATER CONSERVATION

01:47:05.218 --> 01:47:07.020
REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE IN PLACE

01:47:07.087 --> 01:47:11.458
THROUGH TWENTY SIXTEEN- IN.

01:47:11.525 --> 01:47:12.559
SINCE THAT TIME THERE WAS

01:47:12.626 --> 01:47:14.327
LEGISLATION PASSED THE

01:47:14.394 --> 01:47:15.662
CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION AS A

01:47:15.729 --> 01:47:18.498
WAY OF LIFE LEGISLATION. THAT

01:47:18.565 --> 01:47:21.034
CAN REFOCUS IS THE- PROCS

01:47:21.101 --> 01:47:22.869
INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT MANDATORY

01:47:22.936 --> 01:47:25.272
CUTBACKS WITHIN THE FOUR

01:47:25.338 --> 01:47:25.839
HUNDRED LARGEST URBAN WATER

01:47:25.906 --> 01:47:28.575
AGENCIES- THE INNOVATIVE CAN'T

01:47:28.642 --> 01:47:29.442
MANDATORY CONSERVATION

01:47:29.509 --> 01:47:31.311
REQUIREMENTS INSTEAD WE'RE

01:47:31.378 --> 01:47:33.647
PIVOTING TOWARDS EFFICIENCY AND

01:47:33.713 --> 01:47:35.682
INCORPORATING. THE UNIQUE

01:47:35.749 --> 01:47:36.683
CIRCUMSTANCE AND KIND OF THE

01:47:36.750 --> 01:47:37.918
MICROCLIMATES ALL ACROSS

01:47:37.984 --> 01:47:39.553
CALIFORNIA SO THAT THE WATER

01:47:39.619 --> 01:47:42.255
USE WITHIN ANY PARTICULAR AREA.

01:47:42.322 --> 01:47:44.324
IT REALLY REFLECTS WHAT THE

01:47:44.391 --> 01:47:45.091
GEOGRAPHY IS LIKE WHAT THE

01:47:45.158 --> 01:47:47.794
CLIMATE IS LIKE AND THAT

01:47:47.861 --> 01:47:49.930
LEGISLATION IS IN ITS PROCESS

01:47:49.996 --> 01:47:50.931
OF KIND OF WORKING ITS WAY

01:47:50.997 --> 01:47:53.166
THROUGH THE- THE IMPLEMENTATION

01:47:53.233 --> 01:47:53.967
STEPS THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER

01:47:54.034 --> 01:47:56.169
RESOURCES. IS CONDUCTING SOME

01:47:56.236 --> 01:47:58.772
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS NOW AND IT

01:47:58.839 --> 01:48:00.173
WILL REFER THAT INFORMATION TO

01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:01.842
THE STATE WATER BOARD I THINK

01:48:01.908 --> 01:48:03.677
THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO AT WHICH

01:48:03.743 --> 01:48:05.545
POINT THE BOARD WILL LOOK AT

01:48:05.612 --> 01:48:06.847
THAT INFORMATION AND ADOPT

01:48:06.913 --> 01:48:08.215
REGULATIONS TO A KIND OF

THESE EFFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS

01:48:10.617 --> 01:48:12.552
STATEWIDE. SO AGAIN THERE WE'VE

01:48:12.619 --> 01:48:13.887
LEARNED I THINK A TREMENDOUS

01:48:13.954 --> 01:48:16.389
ABOUT SINCE LAST DROUGHT AND

01:48:16.456 --> 01:48:20.493

THAT'S THE LOWEST STORAGE LEVEL

01:51:46.366 --> 01:51:48.401
EVER AT THIS TIME OF YEAR IN

01:51:48.468 --> 01:51:50.503
THAT PARTICULAR LAKE. OUR

01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:52.105
SECOND RESERVOIR LIKE CINEMA IS

01:51:52.172 --> 01:51:55.041
ABOUT 61% OF CAPACITY AND THAT

01:51:55.108 --> 01:51:56.743
RAINFALL THAT FEEDS THAT LAKE

01:51:56.810 --> 01:51:58.578
WAS NOT QUITE THIRTEEN INCHES.

01:51:58.645 --> 01:52:00.647
THAT RESERVOIR IS AS LOW AS IT

01:52:00.713 --> 01:52:02.282
HAS EVER BEEN AT THIS TIME OF

01:52:02.348 --> 01:52:05.085
YEAR AS WELL. IN WHILE PERHAPS

01:52:05.151 --> 01:52:06.686
NOT QUITE AS DIRE WE HAD

01:52:06.753 --> 01:52:09.022
SIMILAR CONDITIONS DURING THE

01:52:09.089 --> 01:52:09.823
DROUGHT OF TWO THOUSAND AND

01:52:09.889 --> 01:52:11.458
FOURTEEN. BUT THANKFULLY WE

01:52:11.524 --> 01:52:12.759
LEARNED SOME LESSONS AND DOUBLE

01:52:12.826 --> 01:52:13.993
DOWN ON PLANNING AND

01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:15.595
IMPLEMENTING CONSERVATION AND

01:52:15.662 --> 01:52:16.796
RESILIENCY PRACTICES AND

01:52:16.863 --> 01:52:18.598
PROGRAMS WHICH REALLY ARE

01:52:18.665 --> 01:52:22.402
STARTING TO PAY OFF. IN EARLY

01:52:22.469 --> 01:52:23.269
TWENTY TWENTIES CINEMA WATER

01:52:23.336 --> 01:52:25.038
FILED A TEMPORARY URGENCY

01:52:25.105 --> 01:52:27.240
CHANGE PETITION. TO PRESERVE

01:52:27.307 --> 01:52:28.374
WATER IN LAKE MENDOCINO THAT

01:52:28.441 --> 01:52:31.044
ACTION HAS SAVED OVER TEN

01:52:31.111 --> 01:52:31.611
THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER

01:52:31.678 --> 01:52:33.613
WITHIN THE LAKE THROUGH THE END

01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:35.882
OF TWENTY TWENTY. SO WHILE THE

01:52:35.949 --> 01:52:40.153
pSHOULD BE WORSE. HAD WE NOT

01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:42.055
TAKEN THAT ACTION THAT WE ALSO

01:52:42.122 --> 01:52:43.523
IMPLEMENTE A PUBLIC SERVICE

01:52:43.590 --> 01:52:44.557
ANNOUNCEMENT CAMPAIGN GETTING

01:52:44.624 --> 01:52:46.559
THE WORD OUT TO OUR COMMUNITY.

01:52:46.626 --> 01:52:47.827
I THINK OF NOTE ARE PER CAPITA

01:52:47.894 --> 01:52:49.996
WATER USE IS DOWN ABOUT 31%

01:52:50.063 --> 01:52:51.965
OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS OR

01:52:52.031 --> 01:52:54.434
SO. AND WE USE THAT TO SPREAD

01:52:54.501 --> 01:52:56.536
THE WORD TO USE WATER WISELY

01:52:56.603 --> 01:52:57.670
AND TREATED AS PRECIOUS AS IT

01:52:57.737 --> 01:53:00.073
IS. IN THIS YEAR'S NUMBER WATER

01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:01.674
FILED ANOTHER. TEMPORARY

01:53:01.741 --> 01:53:03.810
URGENCY CHANGE ORDER TO REDUCE

01:53:03.877 --> 01:53:04.477
WATER RELEASES FROM LAKE

01:53:04.544 --> 01:53:06.279
MENDOCINO. THIS PETITION WAS

01:53:06.346 --> 01:53:08.014
APPROVED BY THE STATE WATER.

01:53:08.081 --> 01:53:12.285
RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD AS WELL.

01:53:12.352 --> 01:53:13.419
SO WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN OUR

01:53:13.486 --> 01:53:14.454
FLOWS IN RUSSIAN- FOR

01:53:14.521 --> 01:53:15.889
ENDANGERED SALMON AND STEELHEAD

01:53:15.955 --> 01:53:17.257
THAT RUN THE RIVER FOR OUR OWN

01:53:17.323 --> 01:53:18.591
DRINKING WATER SUPPLY THE

01:53:18.658 --> 01:53:21.161
HEALTH OF THE RIVER AND ALL

01:53:21.227 --> 01:53:21.728
THAT FLOWS FROM IT INCLUDING

01:53:21.794 --> 01:53:23.429
RECREATION. AS YOU DON'T

01:53:23.496 --> 01:53:24.564
GOVERNOR NEWSOM STOOD ON THE

01:53:24.631 --> 01:53:26.199
BIG LAKE BED OF LAKE MENDOCINO

01:53:26.266 --> 01:53:27.634
JUST A COUPLE WEEKS BACK AND

01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:29.235
PROCLAIM TO DROUGHT EMERGENCY

FOR. MEDICINAL AND SNOW

01:53:30.370 --> 01:53:32.472
COUNTIES. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR

01:53:32.539 --> 01:53:33.540
THE PROCLAMATION AND WE'RE

01:53:33.606 --> 01:53:34.841
WORKING WITH OUR STATE LOCAL

01:53:34.908 --> 01:53:36.676
PARTNERS USING EVERY TOOL MADE

01:53:36.743 --> 01:53:37.544
AVAILABLE THROUGH THE

DECLARATION TO ENSURE WATER

01:53:39.312 --> 01:53:41.347
AVAILABILITY. AND TO PROTECT

01:53:41.414 --> 01:53:43.950
OUR WATERSHEDS HEALTH AS MUCH

01:53:44.017 --> 01:53:44.384
AS POSSIBLE IN THESE

01:53:44.450 --> 01:53:46.786
CHALLENGING TIMES. I WANT TO

01:53:46.853 --> 01:53:48.421
INTRODUCE TO YOU IF YOU AREN'T

01:53:48.488 --> 01:53:49.589
ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THE

01:53:49.656 --> 01:53:50.723
PROGRAM WE HAVE BEEN WORKING

01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:53.326
ON- AND WE'VE ALREADY SEEN SOME

01:53:53.393 --> 01:53:55.061
BENEFIT FROM. I HEARD THE

01:53:55.128 --> 01:53:57.130
COMMENTS- IN QUESTIONS ON

01:53:57.197 --> 01:53:59.032
STORAGE AND THIS IS A PROJECT

01:53:59.098 --> 01:54:00.567
PROJECT AND I'M VERY EXCITED

01:54:00.633 --> 01:54:01.701
ABOUT AS A DIRECTOR OF THE

01:54:01.768 --> 01:54:03.203
WATER AGENCIES CALL FORECAST

01:54:03.269 --> 01:54:06.706
INFORMED RESERVOIR OPERATIONS-

01:54:06.773 --> 01:54:08.942
OR PHARAOH. IF YOU WILL. IT'S

01:54:09.008 --> 01:54:11.945
USING THE BEST DATA AVAILABLE

01:54:12.011 --> 01:54:12.478
TO MANAGE WATER STORAGE IN

01:54:12.545 --> 01:54:14.314
RESERVOIRS. IT'S BEST TOLD

01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:15.481
REALLY I THINK BY GOING BACK TO

01:54:15.548 --> 01:54:18.184
ITS INCEPTION. SO IN TWO

01:54:18.251 --> 01:54:19.552
THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN THE LAST

01:54:19.619 --> 01:54:21.020
DROUGHT THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED.

01:54:21.087 --> 01:54:22.789
LIKE MENACING OF WATER LEVEL

01:54:22.855 --> 01:54:24.924
WAS NOT CLOSE TO CAPACITY. BUT

01:54:24.991 --> 01:54:26.726
THE U. S. ARMY CORPS AGAIN WHO

01:54:26.793 --> 01:54:27.727
MANAGES RESERVOIR FOR FLOOD

01:54:27.794 --> 01:54:29.829
CONTROL REFERRED TO A DIDN'T

01:54:29.896 --> 01:54:31.497
RULE BOOK FOR NEARLY FIFTY

01:54:31.564 --> 01:54:33.433
YEARS AGO. WHICH SAID IN

01:54:33.499 --> 01:54:36.336
ESSENCE IF THE WATER LEVEL IS

01:54:36.402 --> 01:54:38.504
AT THIS ELEVATION AND THE STORM

01:54:38.571 --> 01:54:39.072
IS COMING. YOU RELEASED THE

01:54:39.138 --> 01:54:42.141
WATER. MAKES SENSE IN THEORY-

01:54:42.208 --> 01:54:43.710
BUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT RAIN

01:54:43.776 --> 01:54:46.479
NEVER FOLLOWED. AND TENS OF

01:54:46.546 --> 01:54:47.413
THOUSANDS OF ACRE FEET OF WATER

01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:50.316
WAS LOST. AND THAT PARTICULAR

01:54:50.383 --> 01:54:52.352
YEAR WE NEVER REALLY RECOVERED.

01:54:52.418 --> 01:54:53.219
WE STARTED WORKING WITH THE

01:54:53.286 --> 01:54:54.721
SCRIPTS INSTITUTE OF

01:54:54.787 --> 01:54:56.789
OCEANOGRAPHY CENTER FOR WESTERN

01:54:56.856 --> 01:54:58.157
WEATHER AND WATER EXTREMES AS

01:54:58.224 --> 01:55:00.526
WELL AS G. W. ARE. NO LONGER

01:55:00.593 --> 01:55:02.228
AND THE WEATHER SERVICE TO

01:55:02.295 --> 01:55:03.930
BETTER UNDERSTAND FORECASTING

01:55:03.997 --> 01:55:07.934
AND PRECIPITATION AS STORMS

01:55:08.001 --> 01:55:10.169
FROM IN ACROSS THE PACIFIC.

01:55:10.236 --> 01:55:11.437
WHAT WE DISCOVERED IS THESE

01:55:11.504 --> 01:55:12.939
NARROW BANDS OF MOISTURE THAT

01:55:13.006 --> 01:55:15.675
HIT OUR WATERSHED WE NOW WE NOW

01:55:15.742 --> 01:55:16.676
ALL KNOW THEM AS ATMOSPHERIC

01:55:16.743 --> 01:55:19.212
RIVERS. THEY DO ACCOUNT 450% OF

01:55:19.279 --> 01:55:20.480
THE STATE'S PRECIPITATION IT

01:55:20.546 --> 01:55:21.881
REALLY COMES DOWN TO A FEW

01:55:21.948 --> 01:55:23.449
STORMS A YEAR THAT DETERMINE IF

01:55:23.516 --> 01:55:25.551
WE HAVE A DRY AN AVERAGE OR

01:55:25.618 --> 01:55:27.754
WHAT YEAR. IN IF YOU ARE

01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:29.889
MANAGING A RESERVOIR. YOU WANT

01:55:29.956 --> 01:55:32.025
TO KNOW IF THE ATMOSPHERE IS

01:55:32.091 --> 01:55:32.625
GOING TO HIT YOUR WATERSHED OR

01:55:32.692 --> 01:55:35.928
MISS. MANY TIMES A FEW MILES

01:55:35.995 --> 01:55:38.164
EITHER WAY CAN MAKE OR BREAK IN

01:55:38.231 --> 01:55:40.633
OUR WATER YEAR. SO AGAIN

01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:42.035
WORKING WITH SCRIPTS WITH OUR

01:55:42.101 --> 01:55:45.538
PARTNERS AT THE STATE- RESEARCH

01:55:45.605 --> 01:55:46.439
WAS DONE TO REALLY TRY TO

01:55:46.506 --> 01:55:49.042
TRACK. ALL THESE ATMOSPHERIC.

01:55:49.108 --> 01:55:51.144
RIVERS ARE PERFORMED IN WHAT WE

01:55:51.210 --> 01:55:53.112
CAN TAKE FROM THATSO THAT WE

01:55:53.179 --> 01:55:54.080
CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE THAT RULE

01:55:54.147 --> 01:55:57.016
BOOK TO BE A LITTLE MORE

01:55:57.083 --> 01:55:57.550
CONSERVATIVE AND RELEASING

01:55:57.617 --> 01:56:01.821
WATER- OUR PARTNERSHIP BEGAN

01:56:01.888 --> 01:56:03.423
FLYING RECON MISSIONS OUT OVER

01:56:03.489 --> 01:56:05.291
THE PACIFIC OCEAN TO TRACK THE

01:56:05.358 --> 01:56:05.792
ROUTES IN INTENSITY THE

01:56:05.858 --> 01:56:08.828
ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS- I CAN TELL

01:56:08.895 --> 01:56:10.229
YOU THAT WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL

01:56:10.296 --> 01:56:11.531
THAT IN THAT PARTICULAR YEAR

01:56:11.597 --> 01:56:13.266
WITH THE- WITH WORKING WITH

01:56:13.333 --> 01:56:15.001
THEN SENATOR MARTY BLOCK.

01:56:15.068 --> 01:56:18.371
PASSED SB SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT IN

01:56:18.438 --> 01:56:18.871
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND

01:56:18.938 --> 01:56:20.306
CREATED THE ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS

01:56:20.373 --> 01:56:22.308
RESEARCH MITIGATION AND CLIMATE

01:56:22.375 --> 01:56:25.478
FORECASTING- PROGRAM. AND

01:56:25.545 --> 01:56:26.412
THANKS TO SUBSEQUENT

01:56:26.479 --> 01:56:27.880
APPROPRIATIONS THAT PROGRAM

01:56:27.947 --> 01:56:29.282
WE'RE ABLE TO CONDUCT A PILOT

01:56:29.349 --> 01:56:31.317
PROGRAM AT LAKE MENDOCINO

01:56:31.384 --> 01:56:33.119
WORKING WITH THE ARMY CORPS TO

01:56:33.186 --> 01:56:34.887
CHESTER RESEARCH AND THEORIES.

01:56:34.954 --> 01:56:36.656
AND USE A DEVIATION TO HOLD

01:56:36.723 --> 01:56:38.891
BACK WATER INTO THE FLOOD POOL.

01:56:38.958 --> 01:56:39.959
THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN

01:56:40.026 --> 01:56:43.029
RELEASED- THE RESULT IS ABOUT

01:56:43.096 --> 01:56:45.331
ELEVEN THOUSAND ACRE FEET- THAT

01:56:45.398 --> 01:56:47.667
I MENTIONED EARLIER. TO ME THIS

01:56:47.734 --> 01:56:49.135
IS VERY EXCITING- THIS IS

01:56:49.202 --> 01:56:51.003
WHERE- IF WE CAN IMPROVE THE

01:56:51.070 --> 01:56:52.572
STORAGE CAPACITY OF EACH AND

01:56:52.638 --> 01:56:54.240
EVERY RESERVOIR IN THE STATE-

01:56:54.307 --> 01:56:58.378
BY. SOME PERCENTAGE POINT OF.

01:56:58.444 --> 01:57:01.647
MAYBE FIVE MAYBE UP 210% THAT

01:57:01.714 --> 01:57:03.182
WOULD BE A GREAT MOVE FORWARD I

01:57:03.249 --> 01:57:04.550
THINK IN TERMS OF TRULY

01:57:04.617 --> 01:57:06.052
MANAGING OUR WATER SUPPLY WITH

01:57:06.119 --> 01:57:07.587
THIS VOLATILE WEATHER PATTERNS

01:57:07.653 --> 01:57:10.456
THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING. WE

01:57:10.523 --> 01:57:11.724
PUBLISHED INITIAL VIABILITY

01:57:11.791 --> 01:57:13.459
ASSESSMENT THAT SHOWS FORECAST

01:57:13.526 --> 01:57:15.528
INFORMED RESERVOIR OPERATIONS-

01:57:15.595 --> 01:57:18.231
DO WORK. IN CINEMA WATER IS NOT

01:57:18.297 --> 01:57:19.599
THE ONLY WATER AGENCY INVESTING

01:57:19.665 --> 01:57:21.701
IN EUROPE AT WE BUILT A

01:57:21.768 --> 01:57:23.770
COALITION. AND THAT WE HAVE

01:57:23.836 --> 01:57:24.937
SUPPORT FROM THAT EFFORT THAT

01:57:25.004 --> 01:57:26.873
INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING- SAN

01:57:26.939 --> 01:57:27.940
DIEGO COUNTY ORANGE COUNTY

01:57:28.007 --> 01:57:30.543
IRVINE RANCH TURLOCK YUBA AND

01:57:30.610 --> 01:57:33.346
SANTA CLARA. AND IN ORDER TO

01:57:33.413 --> 01:57:35.248
EXPAND UPON THE PROMISE OF VERO

01:57:35.314 --> 01:57:37.283
WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FIND IT

01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:38.718
E. W. R. PROGRAM AND PILOT

01:57:38.785 --> 01:57:41.954
DEVIATIONS AT OTHER RESERVOIRS.

01:57:42.021 --> 01:57:43.790
THE ATMOSPHERIC RIVER RESEARCH

01:57:43.856 --> 01:57:45.324
CREATES THE FORECAST THAT'S THE

01:57:45.391 --> 01:57:47.193
F. IN VERO AND WITHOUT THAT

01:57:47.260 --> 01:57:48.828
ATMOSPHERIC RIVER RESEARCH

01:57:48.895 --> 01:57:50.763
FUNDING. THERE REALLY IS NO

01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:52.832
PHARAOH. AND FOR MY WATER

01:57:52.899 --> 01:57:54.634
AGENCY WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO APPLY

01:57:54.700 --> 01:57:56.436
THAT HAD WE BEEN ABLE TO APPLY

01:57:56.502 --> 01:57:58.137
FOR. LAKES NANA WE COULD SAVE

01:57:58.204 --> 01:58:00.973
EVEN MORE WATER AND CRITICALLY

01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:02.642
NEEDED AT THIS MOMENT. I THANK

01:58:02.708 --> 01:58:04.777
GOD THIS IS A REALLY EXCITING

01:58:04.844 --> 01:58:05.778
PROGRAM THAT HAS GREAT

01:58:05.845 --> 01:58:08.014
POTENTIAL TO REALLY BE A GAME

01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:09.449
CHANGER WATER MANAGEMENT

01:58:09.515 --> 01:58:10.116
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

01:58:10.183 --> 01:58:13.019
CALIFORNIA. AND IT REALLY DOES

01:58:13.085 --> 01:58:14.454
DEPEND ON SOME STABLE FUNDING

01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:15.788
TO BE W. OURS ATMOSPHERIC

01:58:15.855 --> 01:58:17.790
RIVERS PROGRAM. I THINK IT'S AN

01:58:17.857 --> 01:58:19.792
INVESTMENT AND- IN THE FUTURE

01:58:19.859 --> 01:58:21.260
AS WE MANAGE THROUGH THESE

01:58:21.327 --> 01:58:23.463
DROUGHTS THAT ARE COMING ALL

01:58:23.529 --> 01:58:25.665
TOO OFTEN. I WILL SAY IN THE

01:58:25.731 --> 01:58:28.067
SAME VEIN IS ZERO THE WATER

01:58:28.134 --> 01:58:29.168
AGENCY IS WORKING AGAIN WITH

01:58:29.235 --> 01:58:30.870
SCRIPTS. HYLARANA STATE

01:58:30.937 --> 01:58:33.206
UNIVERSITY GW ARE AGAIN A GREAT

01:58:33.272 --> 01:58:35.675
PARTNER. IN FLOOD CONTROL AND

01:58:35.741 --> 01:58:37.076
WATER AGENCIES PARTNERS AROUND

01:58:37.143 --> 01:58:39.145
THE BAY AREA I'M WHAT WE CALL.

01:58:39.212 --> 01:58:41.047
THE ADVANCED QUANTITATIVE

01:58:41.113 --> 01:58:43.115
PRECIPITATION INFORMATION. IT'S

01:58:43.182 --> 01:58:46.252
A MOUTHFUL- BUT THE ACRONYM IS-

01:58:46.319 --> 01:58:48.788
BASICALLY AQ PI. IT'S NOT

01:58:48.855 --> 01:58:50.289
REALLY MUCH BETTER AS AN

01:58:50.356 --> 01:58:52.291
ACRONYM BUT- IT REALLY IS-

01:58:52.358 --> 01:58:54.160
ABOUT USING ADVANCED RADAR

01:58:54.227 --> 01:58:56.028
TECHNOLOGY TO FORECAST AGAIN

01:58:56.095 --> 01:58:58.064
THE PRECIPITATION THAT COMES IN

01:58:58.130 --> 01:59:00.199
ACROSS THE PACIFIC. R. AS I

01:59:00.266 --> 01:59:02.235
UNDERSTAND IT A LOT OF OUR-

01:59:02.301 --> 01:59:03.603
RADAR SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT FOR

01:59:03.669 --> 01:59:05.505
WEATHER FORECASTING DON'T HAVE

01:59:05.571 --> 01:59:07.473
THE FINE GRAIN DETAIL THAT ONE

01:59:07.540 --> 01:59:09.809
NEEDS TO REALLY- GET THE

01:59:09.876 --> 01:59:11.978
INFORMATION NEEDED. THAT SET AT

01:59:12.044 --> 01:59:14.747
THE SCALE- THAT YOU NEED TO

01:59:14.814 --> 01:59:17.316
REALLY PUT INTO WORK ON TO

01:59:17.383 --> 01:59:19.151
CHANGE THE WORLD BOOKS TO

01:59:19.218 --> 01:59:20.019
CHANGE THE WAY THE RESERVOIRS

01:59:20.086 --> 01:59:23.623
ARE MANAGED- AND- THESE THESE

01:59:23.689 --> 01:59:24.857
RADAR SYSTEMS WILL HELP US DO

01:59:24.924 --> 01:59:26.959
THAT. SO WE'RE REALLY EXCITED

01:59:27.026 --> 01:59:28.094
ABOUT THAT AS WELL WE THINK

01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:30.296
THAT IT'S ALL ON WORKING

01:59:30.363 --> 01:59:31.931
TOGETHER TO REALLY MAKE SURE

01:59:31.998 --> 01:59:33.933
THAT WE CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:35.234
HOW THESE STORMS ARE GONNA HIT

01:59:35.301 --> 01:59:36.636
WHERE THE CAR HIT HOW MUCH

01:59:36.702 --> 01:59:38.738
PRECIPITATION IS GOING TO FALL.

01:59:38.804 --> 01:59:40.206
WHETHER IT'S IN THE WAERSHED

01:59:40.273 --> 01:59:41.107
OR NOT AND THEN WHAT YOU DO

01:59:41.173 --> 01:59:43.075
WITH THE RESERVOIR- AS YOU

01:59:43.142 --> 01:59:44.644
PREPARE FOR IT BUILDING AFTER

01:59:44.710 --> 01:59:47.847
THOSE STORMS- SO IT WORKS IN

01:59:47.914 --> 01:59:49.949
CONCERT WITH GIRL IT COULD BE I

01:59:50.016 --> 01:59:51.751
GUESS. ON AGAIN BETTER

01:59:51.817 --> 01:59:54.687
PINPOINTING- IN BETTER

01:59:54.754 --> 01:59:56.589
MANAGEMENT. THE OTHER THING

01:59:56.656 --> 01:59:57.490
THAT WE'VE DONE- BESIDES THESE

01:59:57.557 --> 01:59:58.824
REALLY HIGH TECH VERSIONS OF

01:59:58.891 --> 02:00:00.126
THINGS AND SOME OF THE REALLY

02:00:00.192 --> 02:00:01.360
DOWN AND DIRTY THINGS THAT ONE

02:00:01.427 --> 02:00:04.230
DOES- DURING DROUGHTS- WE HAD A

02:00:04.297 --> 02:00:06.198
DROUGHT DRIVE UP. A DROUGHT

02:00:06.265 --> 02:00:08.334
DRIVE UP TO REALLY JUST THAT ON

02:00:08.401 --> 02:00:10.503
THINK OF- COATED- YOU KNOW

02:00:10.570 --> 02:00:12.471
VACCINES ARE TESTING. IT'S

02:00:12.538 --> 02:00:13.606
REALLY HAVING PEOPLE DRIVE UP

02:00:13.673 --> 02:00:15.641
AND GET A PACKAGE OF- TOOL KITS

02:00:15.708 --> 02:00:16.876
THAT INCLUDE WATER SVING

02:00:16.943 --> 02:00:19.912
DEVICES FOR IMMEDIATE WATER

02:00:19.979 --> 02:00:20.513
CONSERVATION NEEDS DURING THE

02:00:20.580 --> 02:00:22.248
DROUGHT. LIKE SHOWER HEADS AND

02:00:22.315 --> 02:00:23.716
TOILETS DONNA TABS TO CHECK FOR

02:00:23.783 --> 02:00:25.585
LEAKS. SHOWER BUCKETS HOSE

02:00:25.651 --> 02:00:27.119
NOZZLES EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS

02:00:27.186 --> 02:00:28.254
ITS REALLY GETTING THE WORD

02:00:28.321 --> 02:00:30.523
OUT. IN A WAY THAT- WE FOUND TO

02:00:30.590 --> 02:00:32.792
BE VERY SUCCESSFUL- WE THINK WE

02:00:32.858 --> 02:00:34.126
WOULD LIKE TO IT WORKS WELL IN

02:00:34.193 --> 02:00:35.494
URBANIZED AREAS QUITE FRANKLY

02:00:35.561 --> 02:00:36.495
AND WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPAND

02:00:36.562 --> 02:00:38.030
THIS. A BUT OF COURSE THAT

02:00:38.097 --> 02:00:39.999
TAKES US SOME FUNDING AS WELL

02:00:40.066 --> 02:00:42.702
AND WE DO THINK- WE'VE- HAD A

02:00:42.768 --> 02:00:44.670
LOT OF SUCCESS. ON BY HAVING

02:00:44.737 --> 02:00:46.138
THESE. DROP POP UPS THEY

02:00:46.205 --> 02:00:48.708
BECOME- KNOWN ON THE NEWS AND

02:00:48.774 --> 02:00:52.545
GETS THE WORD OUT. I BELIEVE IN

02:00:52.612 --> 02:00:54.013
A MUCH MUCH BETTER WAY. AND I

02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:55.314
CAN TELL YOU THIS FROM WHERE I

02:00:55.381 --> 02:00:56.949
SIT IN MY DISTRICT HERE IN THE

02:00:57.016 --> 02:00:58.384
SOUTHERN END OF CINEMA COUNTY

02:00:58.451 --> 02:01:00.186
AGRICULTURE IS ONE OF OUR

02:01:00.252 --> 02:01:02.388
ECONOMIC DRIVERS. RATES IN OUR

02:01:02.455 --> 02:01:04.323
REGION- VALUED AT THREE HUNDRED

02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:05.257
FIFTY SIX MILLION LAST YEAR

02:01:05.324 --> 02:01:06.726
THAT'S ONLY ABOUT HALF OF WHAT

02:01:06.792 --> 02:01:08.294
IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND AND

02:01:08.361 --> 02:01:09.695
NINETEEN. WE HAVE A LOT OF FIRE

02:01:09.762 --> 02:01:12.031
DAMAGE LAST YEAR AND SMOKE

02:01:12.098 --> 02:01:15.001
DAMAGE- FROM THE WILDFIRES-

02:01:15.067 --> 02:01:16.002
FOLLOWING GRAPES MILK

02:01:16.068 --> 02:01:17.803
PRODUCTION WAS VALUED IN TWO

02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:18.904
THOUSAND AND NINETEEN AT ABOUT

02:01:18.971 --> 02:01:19.805
A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN

02:01:19.872 --> 02:01:22.842
MILLION. LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY-

02:01:22.908 --> 02:01:24.810
ALSO ARE BIG AND SONOMA COUNTY.

02:01:24.877 --> 02:01:26.012
THE SEVERE DROUGHT CONDITIONS

02:01:26.078 --> 02:01:28.347
ARE IMPACTING RIGHT NOW- IF

02:01:28.414 --> 02:01:29.548
YOU'RE DISHING FOR CROPS AND

02:01:29.615 --> 02:01:31.317
WATER LIVESTOCK. WATER FOR

02:01:31.384 --> 02:01:32.885
LIVESTOCK AND FEED AND I COULD

02:01:32.952 --> 02:01:34.453
TELL YOU THAT THE- THERE ARE

02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:36.022
WATER HAULING PROGRAMS ALREADY

02:01:36.088 --> 02:01:38.391
UNDERWAY- FOR AREAS WEST OF

02:01:38.457 --> 02:01:41.027
WHERE I LIVE HERE IN PETALUMA-

02:01:41.093 --> 02:01:42.995
FOR RANCHES ACT HAVE. RUN DRY

02:01:43.062 --> 02:01:45.531
OR THEIR AG PLANS ARE NOW DRY.

02:01:45.598 --> 02:01:47.299
AND OF COURSE IT'S ONLY ON THE

02:01:47.366 --> 02:01:52.104
FIFTH OF MAY GOING FORWARD SO

02:01:52.171 --> 02:01:52.672
IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG DRY

02:01:52.738 --> 02:01:54.373
YEAR. WE'RE HOPEFUL- THAT WE

02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:55.808
HAVE A REPRIEVE FROM WILDFIRES

02:01:55.875 --> 02:01:58.210
THIS YEAR BUT AGAIN WE ALL

02:01:58.277 --> 02:02:01.013
KNOW- WE'RE- YOU KNOW WHAT

02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:02.882
WE'RE FACING. I KNOW OF

02:02:02.948 --> 02:02:03.883
PERSONALLY I CAN TELL YOU MY

02:02:03.949 --> 02:02:06.152
SONS- CALIFORNIA FIREFIGHTER-

02:02:06.218 --> 02:02:07.620
WAS THAT A COUPLE FIRES UP IN

02:02:07.687 --> 02:02:09.989
LAKE COUNTY. LAST WEEK AND SAID

02:02:10.056 --> 02:02:12.625
THE MOISTURE CONTENT ON AT MAY

02:02:12.692 --> 02:02:14.293
FIRST WAS ABOUT WHAT IT SHOULD

02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:16.896
BE AND AUGUST FIRST SO WE ARE

02:02:16.962 --> 02:02:20.666
ALREADY AND- I DIRE SITUATION

02:02:20.733 --> 02:02:23.102
THERE- ON THE AGRICULTURE FRONT

02:02:23.169 --> 02:02:26.038
AGAIN- RANCHERS HAVE. BEEN

02:02:26.105 --> 02:02:26.972
FACING TOUGH DECISIONS THEY'VE

02:02:27.039 --> 02:02:28.007
BEEN CALLING THEIR HERDS

02:02:28.074 --> 02:02:28.708
THEY'VE BEEN SELLING THEIR

02:02:28.774 --> 02:02:30.710
HERDS TRANSFERRING THEIR HERDS

02:02:30.776 --> 02:02:31.310
TRYING TO FIND ALTERNATE

02:02:31.377 --> 02:02:34.046
SOURCES OF WATER- OUR ON FARM

02:02:34.113 --> 02:02:35.214
BUREAU HERE HAS BEEN WORKING

02:02:35.281 --> 02:02:38.017
WITH- WITH THEM- TO DO WHAT WE

02:02:38.084 --> 02:02:39.018
CAN AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH

02:02:39.085 --> 02:02:40.786
THEM AS WELL TO. MAKE SURE THAT

02:02:40.853 --> 02:02:43.422
WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEM AS

02:02:43.489 --> 02:02:46.292
THEY GO FORWARD THROUGH THIS.

02:02:46.358 --> 02:02:48.394
DIFFICULT TIME. THERE'S ALSO

02:02:48.461 --> 02:02:50.563
BEEN A SIGNIFICANT- DECREASE

02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:51.864
THE AVAILABILITY OF RECLAIMED

02:02:51.931 --> 02:02:53.299
WATER SOMETHING THAT WE'VE

02:02:53.365 --> 02:02:54.734
REALLY BEEN WORKING ON HERE

02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:56.368
IT'S NOT MY COUNTY AND WITH THE

02:02:56.435 --> 02:02:58.137
OTHER COUNTY ARE MARIN COUNTY.

02:02:58.204 --> 02:03:00.439
AS WELL AS NAPA- IN KIND OF A

02:03:00.506 --> 02:03:03.175
LARGER- WATERSHED APPROACH TO

02:03:03.242 --> 02:03:04.810
RECYCLED WATER. IN MAKING IT

02:03:04.877 --> 02:03:07.313
AVAILABLE FOR OUR AGRICULTURAL-

02:03:07.379 --> 02:03:08.948
OF PARTNERS INCLUDING FOR FROST

02:03:09.014 --> 02:03:10.916
PROTECTION. ON THE GREAT FINDS

02:03:10.983 --> 02:03:13.185
WHICH IS A- A VERY GOOD USE FOR

02:03:13.252 --> 02:03:15.020
THIS WATER AS WELL AS- PASTURE

02:03:15.087 --> 02:03:17.957
AND HAY CROP IRRIGATION. IT'S

02:03:18.023 --> 02:03:19.625
THAT THOUGH IS AMPLIFYING THE

02:03:19.692 --> 02:03:20.926
CHALLENGE OF WATER SCARCITY

02:03:20.993 --> 02:03:24.964
AGAIN. HAVING A- NOT HAVING AS

02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:25.598
MUCH RECYCLED WATER AS WE WOULD

02:03:25.664 --> 02:03:29.268
LIKE- YOU KNOW THE EDMONSON

02:03:29.335 --> 02:03:31.337
RESERVOIRS OF ALSO BEEN CRUCIAL

02:03:31.403 --> 02:03:34.840
FOR FIGHTING FIRES. AND WE'RE

02:03:34.907 --> 02:03:35.441
SEEING THESE WATER SOURCES ARE

02:03:35.508 --> 02:03:38.377
QUICKLY DRYING UP- AND- WE

02:03:38.444 --> 02:03:39.445
WORRY ABOUT THAT AS THIS YEAR

02:03:39.512 --> 02:03:42.381
GOES ON AND AS THE WEATHER

02:03:42.448 --> 02:03:43.916
BECOMES WARMER GOING FORWARD. I

02:03:43.983 --> 02:03:47.787
THINK- OBVIOUSLY THAT FARMERS

02:03:47.853 --> 02:03:49.421
ARE CONDUCTING STEPS ARE READY

02:03:49.488 --> 02:03:51.624
THEY ARE REALLY HAVE THEIR NOSE

02:03:51.690 --> 02:03:52.458
TO THE GRINDSTONE AND

02:03:52.525 --> 02:03:55.528
UNDERSTAND THEIR- WHAT IT TAKES

02:03:55.594 --> 02:03:57.296
TO SURVIVE BUT AT THE END THE

02:03:57.363 --> 02:03:58.764
DAY WE NEED WATER TO FALL FROM

02:03:58.831 --> 02:03:59.932
THE SKY AND WE NEED TO MAKE

02:03:59.999 --> 02:04:01.233
SURE THAT WE'RE TREATING IT AS

02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:04.503
PRECIOUS AS IT IS- WE NEED

02:04:04.570 --> 02:04:05.471
IMMEDIATE DROUGHT RELIEF

02:04:05.538 --> 02:04:06.806
FUNDING TO SUPPORT AGRICULTURE

02:04:06.872 --> 02:04:08.908
QUITE FRANKLY IN THIS COUNTY-

02:04:08.974 --> 02:04:10.810
AND THAT INCLUDES PROJECTS TO

02:04:10.876 --> 02:04:12.678
JUMPSTART GROUNDWATER RECHARGE.

02:04:12.745 --> 02:04:13.813
REALLY THE INSTALLATION OF

02:04:13.879 --> 02:04:15.981
LINERS IN OUR AREA- AREA PONDS

02:04:16.048 --> 02:04:17.016
AND RESERVOIRS THAT'LL HELP

02:04:17.082 --> 02:04:19.051
WOMEN THAT GROUNDWATER OR THE

02:04:19.118 --> 02:04:20.886
AMOUNT OF WATER LOST TO

02:04:20.953 --> 02:04:22.788
ABSORPTION AND ALLOW FOR LONGER

02:04:22.855 --> 02:04:24.557
STORAGE TIME CAPACITY WHEN

02:04:24.623 --> 02:04:27.259
MACHINES TO COMBAT FROST AS

02:04:27.326 --> 02:04:29.528
OPPOSED TO USING WATER- WOULD

02:04:29.595 --> 02:04:30.963
BE A GOOD THING SOIL MOISTURE

02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:32.431
PROBES TO EFFICIENTLY MANAGE

02:04:32.498 --> 02:04:33.499
IRRIGATION NEEDS EFFICIENT

02:04:33.566 --> 02:04:35.367
STORAGE OF OFFSITE AND ONSITE

02:04:35.434 --> 02:04:37.536
WATER. IN THE WAY WE LOOK AT

02:04:37.603 --> 02:04:38.838
THESE THINGS THAT THERE'S A THE

02:04:38.904 --> 02:04:40.739
SHORT TERM IMMEDIATE NEED TO

02:04:40.806 --> 02:04:42.775
KEEP THE BUSINESSES UP AND

02:04:42.842 --> 02:04:44.610
GOING THROUGH THE SUMMER MONTHS

02:04:44.677 --> 02:04:45.644
THERE'S A LONGER TERM

02:04:45.711 --> 02:04:47.012
INVESTMENTS THAT NEED TO BE

02:04:47.079 --> 02:04:48.814
MADE TO REALLY PROVIDE THE

02:04:48.881 --> 02:04:51.650
RESILIENCY NEEDED TO SURVIVE-

02:04:51.717 --> 02:04:53.919
THIS VERY FLASHY SYSTEMS THAT

02:04:53.986 --> 02:04:56.522
WE HAVE WORDS- EITHER IS

02:04:56.589 --> 02:04:58.524
SEEMINGLY IN A DROUGHT YEAR OR

02:04:58.591 --> 02:04:59.625
FLOOD YEAR AND NOTHING IN

02:04:59.692 --> 02:05:01.227
BETWEEN. SO WE JUST NEED TO

02:05:01.293 --> 02:05:02.895
MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE

02:05:02.962 --> 02:05:04.730
TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS IN

02:05:04.797 --> 02:05:09.635
INFRASTRUCTURE IN. IN IN

02:05:09.702 --> 02:05:10.870
RESILIENCY GOING FORWARD. I

02:05:10.936 --> 02:05:11.770
THINK THE FINAL TOPIC I WANTED

02:05:11.837 --> 02:05:12.938
ON IS HOW THE DROUGHT IMPACTS

02:05:13.005 --> 02:05:14.840
THE HEALTH OF OUR WATERSHED AND

02:05:14.907 --> 02:05:15.774
AGAIN INCREASES THE FIRE

02:05:15.841 --> 02:05:18.043
DANGER. AND I DON'T THINK I

02:05:18.110 --> 02:05:20.012
NEED TO TELL YOU- HOUSE CINEMA

02:05:20.079 --> 02:05:21.013
COUNTY HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY

02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:24.383
WILDFIRES- STARTING IN TWO

02:05:24.450 --> 02:05:24.984
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WITH TUBBS

02:05:25.050 --> 02:05:26.318
AND NUNS FIRES FOLLOWED IN BY

02:05:26.385 --> 02:05:28.287
THE CAN GET FIRED IN TWO

02:05:28.354 --> 02:05:29.755
THOUSAND AND- NINETEEN. AND

02:05:29.822 --> 02:05:31.557
THEN JUST LAST YEAR WE WERE HIT

02:05:31.624 --> 02:05:34.059
WITH THE ALLEN YOU COMPLEX-

02:05:34.126 --> 02:05:35.461
THESE FIRES HAVE WREAKED HAVOC

02:05:35.527 --> 02:05:36.896
ON OUR COMMUNITIES I CAN TELL

02:05:36.962 --> 02:05:39.365
YOU THAT- THERE IS A CERTAIN

02:05:39.431 --> 02:05:41.267
AMOUNT OF PTSD. AND THE

02:05:41.333 --> 02:05:43.602
COMMUNITY AS WELL- BUT IT'S

02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:45.571
ALSO RECOUNTED ON A WATERSHED.

02:05:45.638 --> 02:05:47.139
THE ASHLEY DEBRIS OFFLOAD THE

02:05:47.206 --> 02:05:48.440
RUSSIAN RIVER IMPACTING THE

02:05:48.507 --> 02:05:50.342
QUALITY OF THE WATER. PLACING

02:05:50.409 --> 02:05:51.844
FURTHER STRAIN ON THE DEPENDED

02:05:51.911 --> 02:05:53.779
FISH ANDWILDLIFE SPECIES ARE

02:05:53.846 --> 02:05:55.547
PARTNERS IN THE AND THE AGENCY

02:05:55.614 --> 02:05:56.582
HAS. DONE A GREAT JOB I

02:05:56.649 --> 02:05:58.083
BELIEVE. IN TERMS OF GETTING

02:05:58.150 --> 02:05:59.118
OUT THERE RIGHT AWAY RIGHT

02:05:59.184 --> 02:06:01.253
AWAY- POSE FIRE BURNING UP THE

02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:03.155
STRAW WATTLES DOING ALL THE

02:06:03.222 --> 02:06:05.024
THINGS THAT YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO

02:06:05.090 --> 02:06:06.926
DO AND DO REALLY WELL. BUT AT

02:06:06.992 --> 02:06:09.261
THE END OF THE DAY- LANDSCAPE

02:06:09.328 --> 02:06:11.230
IS UP. IT'S BEEN REALLY

02:06:11.297 --> 02:06:13.933
CHARRED. AND IT IN- IN A

02:06:13.999 --> 02:06:16.802
NEGATIVE IMPACT IS- IS CREATED.

02:06:16.869 --> 02:06:18.804
THAT'S REALLY HARD TO OVERCOME.

02:06:18.871 --> 02:06:19.905
SO WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE

02:06:19.972 --> 02:06:20.906
INVESTMENTS THE STATE HAS

02:06:20.973 --> 02:06:22.041
ALREADY MADE TO ADDRESS WILD

02:06:22.107 --> 02:06:24.109
FIRE RESCUE IN WEIRD COURAGE BY

02:06:24.176 --> 02:06:26.245
THE PROSPECT OF. ADDITIONAL

02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:29.448
THE FOREST HEALTH AND REDUCE.

02:06:29.515 --> 02:06:32.418
WILDFIRE RISK EVEN MORE SO- BUT

02:06:32.484 --> 02:06:36.121
WE KNOW THAT THAT ALSO NEEDS TO

02:06:36.188 --> 02:06:36.755
BE SUSTAIN FOR THE LONG TERM. I

02:06:36.822 --> 02:06:38.190
IN OUR COUNTY WE PUT A- TWENTY

02:06:38.257 --> 02:06:39.024
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR

02:06:39.091 --> 02:06:40.859
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT THAT WERE

02:06:40.926 --> 02:06:43.028
REALLY THINKING UP IS-

02:06:43.095 --> 02:06:43.762
HOPEFULLY GOING TO BE

02:06:43.829 --> 02:06:47.032
LEVERAGED- TO REALLY HAVE- KIND

02:06:47.099 --> 02:06:47.933
OF THAT LANDSCAPE SCALE

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.135
APPROACH. TO REALLY FIGURE OUT

02:06:50.202 --> 02:06:51.303
WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE SURE

02:06:51.370 --> 02:06:52.671
THAT EACH AND EVERY YEAR WE'RE

02:06:52.738 --> 02:06:54.373
NOT FACED WITH THE WILDFIRE

02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:56.675
RISKS THAT WE HAVE BEEN-

02:06:56.742 --> 02:06:58.577
DROUGHTS OBVIOUSLY PLAY A HUGE

02:06:58.644 --> 02:07:00.779
ROLE IN THAT. WE BELIEVE THAT

02:07:00.846 --> 02:07:01.580
SOME OF THOSE EARLIER FIRES I

02:07:01.647 --> 02:07:03.615
MENTIONED. ARE WERE THE DIRECT

02:07:03.682 --> 02:07:04.984
RESULT OF THE DAMAGE THAT WAS

02:07:05.050 --> 02:07:06.752
DONE DURING THE DROUGHT OF TWO

02:07:06.819 --> 02:07:08.020
THOUSAND FOURTEEN. A LOT OF

02:07:08.087 --> 02:07:09.922
TREES OUT THERE WERE- WERE

02:07:09.989 --> 02:07:11.557
KILLED BECAUSE OF THAT DROUGHT.

02:07:11.623 --> 02:07:13.225
AND THEY WERE LEFT TO BURN-

02:07:13.292 --> 02:07:14.626
WHEN THOSE FIRES HIT SO WE'RE

02:07:14.693 --> 02:07:15.995
TRYING TO BE PROACTIVE GOING

02:07:16.061 --> 02:07:17.997
FORWARD WE KNOW THAT DROUGHTS.

02:07:18.063 --> 02:07:20.065

02:12:20.232 --> 02:12:22.367
FAMILIES DROPPED THE VALUE

02:12:22.434 --> 02:12:24.069
STATE WE'RE WE'RE IMPACTED.

02:12:24.136 --> 02:12:25.437
MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE

02:12:25.504 --> 02:12:26.004
NOT RECOVERED FROM THE LAST

02:12:26.071 --> 02:12:29.207
DROUGHT. RIGHT RIGHT WELL

02:12:29.274 --> 02:12:31.243
TRIMMING DRYING SOME DAMAGE TO

02:12:31.310 --> 02:12:33.078
HAVE A WATER TANK IN FRONT OF

02:12:33.145 --> 02:12:35.380
THEIR YARD. WE KNOW DROUGHT

02:12:35.447 --> 02:12:36.815
WILL CONTINUE TO GET WORSE DUE

02:12:36.882 --> 02:12:39.084
TO CLIMATE CHANGE. SHARK

02:12:39.151 --> 02:12:41.186
COMMUNITIES AND OUR FAMILIES

02:12:41.253 --> 02:12:44.222
CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALREADY HERE.

02:12:44.289 --> 02:12:46.091
SHIVER COMMUNITIES DROUGHT IS

02:12:46.158 --> 02:12:47.626
ABOUT MORE THAN JUST KEEPING

02:12:47.693 --> 02:12:49.528
WATER FLOWING THAT COMPARED

02:12:49.594 --> 02:12:51.229
DROUGHT IT'S ALSO ABOUT CLIMATE

02:12:51.296 --> 02:12:52.097
CRISIS AND WHETHER WE WILL

02:12:52.164 --> 02:12:53.799
PROVIDE OUR COMMUNITIES WITH

02:12:53.865 --> 02:12:55.901
THE RESILIENCY INVESTMENTS THEY

02:12:55.967 --> 02:12:58.103
NEED. FOR A DROUGHT IS ABOUT

02:12:58.170 --> 02:13:01.073
RACIAL JUSTICE EQUITY AND

02:13:01.139 --> 02:13:04.109
RESPECT. IN A CONTINUE PANDEMIC

02:13:04.176 --> 02:13:05.544
DROUGHT IS ABOUT PRESERVING

02:13:05.610 --> 02:13:08.213
ACCESS FOR MORE MOST BASIC

02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:11.717
FORMAT P. P. WATER. WITH THE

02:13:11.783 --> 02:13:12.951
REMAINDER OF MY TIME I WOULD

02:13:13.018 --> 02:13:14.486
LOVE TO OFFER THREE

02:13:14.553 --> 02:13:14.986
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOUR

02:13:15.053 --> 02:13:18.557
CONSIDERATION. FIRST WE NEED A

02:13:18.623 --> 02:13:20.125
STATE DROUGHT PREPAREDNESS AND

02:13:20.192 --> 02:13:21.393
RESPONSE PLAN PUT IN PLACE

02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:23.295
BEFORE LARGE NUMBERS ARE

02:13:23.362 --> 02:13:25.263
FAMILIES ARE STARTING TO USE

02:13:25.330 --> 02:13:27.499
THE WATER FOR THE SUMMER WE

02:13:27.566 --> 02:13:28.667
WERE NOT READY FOR THE LAST

02:13:28.734 --> 02:13:32.270
ROUTE AS A RESULT WE SCRAMBLED.

02:13:32.337 --> 02:13:33.372
THE LOCAL STATE RESPONSES VERY

02:13:33.438 --> 02:13:35.140
UNCOORDINATED FAMILIES TO KNOW

02:13:35.207 --> 02:13:37.676
WHO TO CALL. AND MANY OF THEM

02:13:37.743 --> 02:13:38.977
WENT WITHOUT WATER FOR FAR TOO

02:13:39.044 --> 02:13:40.846
LONG. SHOULD THE STATE SHOULD

02:13:40.912 --> 02:13:42.914
PROACTIVELY PRIORITIZE REGION

02:13:42.981 --> 02:13:45.617
WE KNOW ARE AT RISK OF HAVING

02:13:45.684 --> 02:13:46.818
THE WATER INTERRUPTED DURING

02:13:46.885 --> 02:13:48.520
THIS DROUGHT. HIS TEACHER PRE

02:13:48.587 --> 02:13:50.489
POSITIONED EMERGENCY RESPONSE

02:13:50.555 --> 02:13:53.992
TO PROVIDE SUCH A BOTTLED WATER

02:13:54.059 --> 02:13:56.027
AND TANKS. I ALSO THINK THAT

02:13:56.094 --> 02:13:57.028
THE STATE NEEDS TO ENSURE THAT

02:13:57.095 --> 02:13:59.297
WE CREATE A CLEAR PUBLIC

02:13:59.364 --> 02:14:01.500
STANDARDIZED PROTOCOLS TO WHO

02:14:01.566 --> 02:14:03.135
SO THAT WE KNOW WHO TO CALL

02:14:03.201 --> 02:14:05.203
WHEN RESIDENTS LOSE WATER ALONG

02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:06.972
WITH A PROACTIVE. OUTREACH

02:14:07.038 --> 02:14:10.242
STRATEGY TO SHARE THE CONTACT

02:14:10.308 --> 02:14:11.276
INFORMATION WITH OUR COMMUNITY.

02:14:11.343 --> 02:14:13.612
SECOND WE NEED TO ALLOCATE

02:14:13.678 --> 02:14:15.046
SIGNIFICANT EMERGENCY DRINKING

02:14:15.113 --> 02:14:17.616
WATER FUNDING NOW. WE HAVE A

02:14:17.682 --> 02:14:20.018
PLACE ONLY NEEDED. THE

02:14:20.085 --> 02:14:22.087
LEGISLATURE REGULARLY ALLOCATED

02:14:22.154 --> 02:14:23.288
EMERGENCY FUNNY DURING THE LAST

02:14:23.355 --> 02:14:25.357
ROUTE FOR BOTTLED WATER AND

02:14:25.424 --> 02:14:27.159
STATE HELPFUL WELL AND

02:14:27.225 --> 02:14:29.995
PROGRAMS. IT IS EASY BUT I DO

02:14:30.061 --> 02:14:30.996
THINK IT WORKS WE HAVE PUT IN

02:14:31.062 --> 02:14:32.531
PLACE NOW THERE'S ONE THING

02:14:32.597 --> 02:14:35.233
LEFT TO WORRY ABOUT DURING THIS

02:14:35.300 --> 02:14:36.968

IN DROUGHT RESILIENT

02:14:39.971 --> 02:14:40.939
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR OUR

02:14:41.006 --> 02:14:42.607
COMMUNITIES WHO ARE ON THE

02:14:42.674 --> 02:14:44.743
FRONTLINE OF CALIFORNIA'S WATER

02:14:44.810 --> 02:14:47.412
KIND OF CRISIS. HERE'S THE

02:14:47.479 --> 02:14:49.080
THING WE ALREADY KNOW THE KINDS

02:14:49.147 --> 02:14:50.715
OF INVESTMENTS THAT WOULD MAKE

02:14:50.782 --> 02:14:51.316
OUR COMMUNITIES MORE DROUGHT

02:14:51.383 --> 02:14:53.718
RESILIENT. FIFTY JUST RELEASED

02:14:53.785 --> 02:14:55.887
A DROP REPORT THAT OUTLINES HE

02:14:55.954 --> 02:14:57.122
BASIC DROUGHT RESILIENT

02:14:57.189 --> 02:14:59.291
MEASURES THESE INCLUDE.

02:14:59.357 --> 02:15:00.625
PROVIDING A BACKUP SOURCE OF

02:15:00.692 --> 02:15:02.093
WATER FOR MORE THAN ONE POLICY

02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:03.428
SYSTEMS THAT CURRENTLY ONLY

02:15:03.495 --> 02:15:04.696
DEPEND ON ONE DRINKING WATER

02:15:04.763 --> 02:15:07.399
WELL. WE TO ENSURE THAT WE

DEPTH OF WATER BEFORE IT

02:15:12.037 --> 02:15:13.939
ACTUALLY RUNS DRY. WE NEED TO

02:15:14.005 --> 02:15:15.407

PROGRESS IN PREPARING FOR

02:16:58.410 --> 02:16:59.778

IMPROVING WATER USE EFFICIENCY.

02:17:02.547 --> 02:17:04.349
AS OTHER CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS

02:17:04.416 --> 02:17:05.951
TO DIVERSIFY WATER SUPPLIES TO

02:17:06.017 --> 02:17:06.451
REDUCE RELIANCE ON THE

BATTLEFIELD. THEY'VE ALSO BEEN

02:17:08.086 --> 02:17:09.588
IMPORTANT ACTIONS TO TRY TO

02:17:09.654 --> 02:17:11.122
ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S LONG

HOWEVER WHEN IT COMES TO

02:17:15.860 --> 02:17:16.661
PROTECTING CALIFORNIA'S FISH

02:17:16.728 --> 02:17:18.196
AND WILDLIFE AND THE THOUSANDS

02:17:18.263 --> 02:17:19.364
OF JOBS IN COMMUNITIES THAT

02:17:19.431 --> 02:17:21.199
DEPEND ON THEIR HEALTH. RATHER

02:17:21.266 --> 02:17:22.200
THAN LEARNING FROM THE LESSONS

02:17:22.267 --> 02:17:23.868
OF THE LAST DROUGHT WE'RE ON

02:17:23.935 --> 02:17:25.971
TRACK TO REPEAT THOSE MISTAKES.

02:17:26.037 --> 02:17:28.573
AND HAVE ANOTHER DISASTER LIKE

02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:29.908
THAT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO

02:17:29.975 --> 02:17:31.543
TWENTY FIFTEEN. TO PUT THIS IN

02:17:31.610 --> 02:17:32.711
CONTEXT IT'S IMPORTANT

02:17:32.777 --> 02:17:33.612
RECOGNIZE THE DROUGHT IS A

02:17:33.678 --> 02:17:34.779
NATURAL PART OF LIFE IN

02:17:34.846 --> 02:17:36.147
CALIFORNIA AN ARTIFICIAL

02:17:36.214 --> 02:17:37.949
WILDLIFE EVOLVED TO ADAPT TO

02:17:38.016 --> 02:17:39.884
PERIODIC DROUGHTS. BUT CLIMATE

02:17:39.951 --> 02:17:41.219
CHANGE IS MAKING DRUGS MUCH

02:17:41.286 --> 02:17:42.821
MORE SEVEREAND FREQUENT SO

02:17:42.887 --> 02:17:44.990
FISH HAVE LESS TIME AND WHILE

02:17:45.056 --> 02:17:46.858
THAT HAS LESS TIME TO RECOVER.

02:17:46.925 --> 02:17:47.959
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY OR AS

02:17:48.026 --> 02:17:49.794
IMPORTANTLY UNSUSTAINABLE WATER

02:17:49.861 --> 02:17:51.229
DIVERSIONS FROM OUR RIVERS AND

02:17:51.296 --> 02:17:52.964
STREAMS DRAMATICALLY WORSENED

02:17:53.031 --> 02:17:53.732
CONDITIONS FOR FISH AND

02:17:53.798 --> 02:17:55.300
WILDLIFE DURING CRAFTS. CLOSER

02:17:55.367 --> 02:17:58.536
ALREADY LOW AND THEN WE DIVERT

02:17:58.603 --> 02:17:59.104
AFTER MORE OF THE WATER THAT

02:17:59.170 --> 02:18:00.639
WOULD OTHERWISE FLOW. MY

02:18:00.705 --> 02:18:01.840
TESTIMONY TODAY IS GOING TO

02:18:01.906 --> 02:18:02.707
FOCUS ON THE BAY DELTA

02:18:02.774 --> 02:18:04.509
WATERSHED WHICH COVERS 40% OF

02:18:04.576 --> 02:18:06.244
THE STATE'S LAND MASS. WHAT IS

02:18:06.311 --> 02:18:07.412
IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THE

02:18:07.479 --> 02:18:08.880
DROUGHT IS CAUSING SIGNIFICANT

02:18:08.947 --> 02:18:09.848
IMPACTS TO FISH WILDLIFE ACROSS

02:18:09.914 --> 02:18:11.716

EFFICIENT STREAMS ALONG THE

02:18:16.087 --> 02:18:17.756
NORTH COAST MIGRATORY BIRDS AND

02:18:17.822 --> 02:18:18.790
WILDLIFE THAT DEPEND ON

02:18:18.857 --> 02:18:20.091
WETLANDS AND WILDLIFE REFUGES

02:18:20.158 --> 02:18:21.192
THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY

02:18:21.259 --> 02:18:23.261
AND MANY MANY OTHERS. AND IT'S

02:18:23.328 --> 02:18:24.562
NOT JUST FISH AND WILDLIFE BUT

02:18:24.629 --> 02:18:25.630
IT'S THE JOBS AND COMMUNITIES

02:18:25.697 --> 02:18:27.499
THAT DEPEND ON THEIR HEALTH

02:18:27.565 --> 02:18:29.134
THAT ARE IMPACTED.

02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:30.902
UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE ON TRACK TO

02:18:30.969 --> 02:18:32.203
REPEAT THE DISASTROUS

02:18:32.270 --> 02:18:34.005
CONDITIONS OF TWENTY FOURTEEN

02:18:34.072 --> 02:18:35.540

DELTA ECOSYSTEM THIS YEAR. AS

02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:53.985
TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE- SOME

FIVE MILLION ACRE FEET OF WATER

02:20:16.641 --> 02:20:19.811
THIS YEAR. AND THAT'S

02:20:19.878 --> 02:20:20.612
CONTRIBUTING TO THE VIOLATIONS

02:20:20.678 --> 02:20:21.579
OF WATER QUALITY STANDARDS AND

02:20:21.646 --> 02:20:23.681
THE TEMPERATURE IMPACTS WE SEE-

02:20:23.748 --> 02:20:25.450
AT OUR UPSTREAM RESERVOIRS.

02:20:25.517 --> 02:20:28.653
WHAT'S MORE. WE'RE ON TRACK TO

02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:30.155
END THIS WATER YEAR WITH THE

02:20:30.221 --> 02:20:31.823
END OF SEPTEMBER HAVING VERY

02:20:31.890 --> 02:20:33.925
LITTLE WATER IN STORAGE. WHICH

02:20:33.992 --> 02:20:35.794
MEANS THAT IF NEXT YEAR OR TRY

02:20:35.860 --> 02:20:37.195
WILL BE REALLY UP THE CREEK

02:20:37.262 --> 02:20:38.830
WITHOUT A PADDLE. THERE

02:20:38.897 --> 02:20:40.331
PROJECTIONS THAT SHASTA WILL

02:20:40.398 --> 02:20:41.132
HAVE LESS THAN A MILLION ACRE

02:20:41.199 --> 02:20:43.134
FEET OF WATER IN STORAGE AT THE

THE END OF SEPTEMBER AND MAY.

02:20:48.573 --> 02:20:49.908
STOP PRODUCING HYDROPOWER

02:20:49.974 --> 02:20:52.177
BECAUSE LAKE LEVELS FALL SO LOW

02:20:52.243 --> 02:20:55.246
SOMETIME IN AUGUST. WE STARTED

02:20:55.313 --> 02:20:56.548
THIS YEAR WITH TWO POINT TWO

02:20:56.614 --> 02:20:57.382
MILLION ACRE FEET OF WATER IN

02:20:57.448 --> 02:20:59.284
SHASTA AND- DECENT STORAGE IN

02:20:59.350 --> 02:21:00.819
ORVILLE. AND YET WE'RE SEEING

02:21:00.885 --> 02:21:02.921
THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS TO OUR

02:21:02.987 --> 02:21:04.055
NATIVE FISH AND WILD LIKE THIS

02:21:04.122 --> 02:21:05.990
YEAR. IF WE START NEXT YEAR

02:21:06.057 --> 02:21:06.858
WITH LESS THAN A MILLION ACRE

02:21:06.925 --> 02:21:08.359
FEET OF WATER IN STE STE

02:21:08.426 --> 02:21:10.161
STORAGE IN CHESTER. THE IMPACT

02:21:10.228 --> 02:21:12.597
WILL BE FAR WORSE. AND FINALLY

02:21:12.664 --> 02:21:13.598
I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT

02:21:13.665 --> 02:21:15.099
WE'RE SEEING THESE IMPACTS IN

02:21:15.166 --> 02:21:16.801
THE SECOND YOU'RE A DROUGHT.

02:21:16.868 --> 02:21:18.269
WHEREAS DURING THE LAST DROUGHT

02:21:18.336 --> 02:21:19.504
IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE THIRD YEAR

02:21:19.571 --> 02:21:20.905
WARY SAW THOSE DEVASTATING

02:21:20.972 --> 02:21:22.507
IMPACTS. IN TERMS OF VIOLATIONS

02:21:22.574 --> 02:21:24.275

TEMPERATURE DEPENDENT MORTALITY

02:21:27.011 --> 02:21:30.148
BELOW SHASTA DAM. THERE ARE

02:21:30.215 --> 02:21:31.316
THREE KEY LESSONS FROM THE LAST

02:21:31.382 --> 02:21:32.684
DROUGHT THAT UNFORTUNATELY WERE

02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:34.719
FAILING TO LEARN. AND THAT ARE

02:21:34.786 --> 02:21:36.588
CONTRIBUTING TO THE DEVASTATING

02:21:36.654 --> 02:21:37.488
IMPACTS WE'RE SEEING LIKELY TO

02:21:37.555 --> 02:21:39.424
SEE THIS YEAR. ONE OF THE MOST

02:21:39.490 --> 02:21:41.259
IMPORTANT LESSONS OF THE LAST

02:21:41.326 --> 02:21:41.860
OUT WAS THE NEED TO PLAN AHEAD

02:21:41.926 --> 02:21:43.995
FOR DROUGHT. AS THE RESOURCES

02:21:44.062 --> 02:21:45.597

FOR WATERSHEDS IN THE ADVENT OF

02:21:58.810 --> 02:22:00.345
EXTENDED DROUGHT. COULD HELP

02:22:00.411 --> 02:22:01.846
WILDLIFE MANAGERS AVOID MAKING

02:22:01.913 --> 02:22:03.414

02:24:29.894 --> 02:24:30.428
AND ON THIS CAL THE STATE IS

02:24:30.495 --> 02:24:32.430
ALSO FEELING. ONE OF THE MOST

02:24:32.497 --> 02:24:33.498
IMPORTANT LESSONS WE LEARNED

02:24:33.564 --> 02:24:35.066
WITH THE NEED TO DEVELOP

02:24:35.133 --> 02:24:36.100
TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT PLANS

02:24:36.167 --> 02:24:37.335
EARLY IN THE YEAR BECAUSE

02:24:37.402 --> 02:24:38.803
RESERVOIR RELEASES FROM SHASTA

02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:40.338
AND KESWICK DAMS AND HER MOTHER

02:24:40.405 --> 02:24:42.473
RESERVOIRS. CAN DEPLETE THE

02:24:42.540 --> 02:24:44.308
COLD WATER POOL NECESSARY TO

02:24:44.375 --> 02:24:47.111
MAINTAIN WATER TEMPERATURES FOR

02:24:47.178 --> 02:24:47.678
SALMON LATER IN THIS IN THE

02:24:47.745 --> 02:24:50.581
YEAR. THE STATE HAS NOT DONE SO

02:24:50.648 --> 02:24:51.215
IN PART BECAUSE THE TRUMP

02:24:51.282 --> 02:24:52.984
ADMINISTRATION. ROLL BACK

02:24:53.051 --> 02:24:54.352
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS UNDER

02:24:54.419 --> 02:24:56.087
THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT. AND

02:24:56.154 --> 02:24:58.256
LEGALIZED KILLING A 100% OF THE

02:24:58.322 --> 02:24:59.190
ENDANGERED WINTER RUN CHINOOK

02:24:59.257 --> 02:25:01.826
SALMON. THANKS AS A GIVEAWAY TO

02:25:01.893 --> 02:25:04.028
CORPORATE AGRIBUSINESSES. THESE

02:25:04.095 --> 02:25:05.596
BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS ARE PLANNED

02:25:05.663 --> 02:25:06.964
FOR EXTINCTION. AND IT IS

02:25:07.031 --> 02:25:08.099
ESSENTIAL THAT THE BIDEN

02:25:08.166 --> 02:25:09.500
ADMINISTRATION SET THEM ASIDE

02:25:09.567 --> 02:25:10.802
AND RE INITIATE CONSULTATIONS

02:25:10.868 --> 02:25:12.203
SO THAT WE CAN DEVELOP

02:25:12.270 --> 02:25:14.439
SCIENTIFICALLY CREDIBLE PLANS

02:25:14.505 --> 02:25:15.473
TO PREVENT EXTINCTION AND

02:25:15.540 --> 02:25:17.141
MANAGE THESE WATER PROJECTS IN

02:25:17.208 --> 02:25:19.777
A ERA. WHEN WE FACE GROWING

02:25:19.844 --> 02:25:22.013
THREATS AND STRUCK HARDER

02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:22.513
CONDITIONS FOR FISH AND

02:25:22.580 --> 02:25:25.116
WILDLIFE. IT'S NOW EARLY MAY

02:25:25.183 --> 02:25:26.784
AND WE STILL DON'T HAVE A DRAFT

02:25:26.851 --> 02:25:27.819
TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR

02:25:27.885 --> 02:25:29.720
SHASTA. EVEN AS EXCESSIVE

02:25:29.787 --> 02:25:30.922
RELEASES FROM THE RESERVOIR

02:25:30.988 --> 02:25:32.123
DEPLETED THE COLD WATER POOL

02:25:32.190 --> 02:25:33.524
STARTING LAST MONTH AND WE'RE

02:25:33.591 --> 02:25:36.761
ON TRACK TO KILL 75280% OF THE

02:25:36.828 --> 02:25:37.295
IT THIS. HIGHLY ENDANGERED

02:25:37.361 --> 02:25:39.397
SPECIES. REDUCING THOSE

02:25:39.464 --> 02:25:40.498
RESERVOIR RELEASES WOULD

02:25:40.565 --> 02:25:41.699
SUBSTANTIALLY DECREASE HOW MANY

02:25:41.766 --> 02:25:43.534
EXAMINER KILLED THIS YEAR. AND

02:25:43.601 --> 02:25:45.369
LEAD MORE WATER IN STORAGE IN

02:25:45.436 --> 02:25:47.038
CASE NEXT YEAR'S ALSO DRIVE.

02:25:47.105 --> 02:25:49.607
HIDING RELEASES WOULD COULD CUT

02:25:49.674 --> 02:25:52.210
MORTALITY FROM 80% DOWN TO

02:25:52.276 --> 02:25:53.678
FIFTY PERCENT. IMPROVE WATER

02:25:53.744 --> 02:25:54.612
TEMPERATURES FOR FALL RUN

02:25:54.679 --> 02:25:56.080
CHINOOK SALMON AND INCREASED

02:25:56.147 --> 02:25:57.748
RESERVOIR STORAGE IN CASE NEXT

02:25:57.815 --> 02:25:59.817
YEAR'S STUFF. AT THE

02:25:59.884 --> 02:26:01.319
RECOMMENDATION OF THE REPORT IS

02:26:01.385 --> 02:26:02.053
TO STREAMLINE WATER RIGHTS

02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:04.155
ENFORCEMENT. AND AGAIN THERE'S

02:26:04.222 --> 02:26:06.090
A LOT MORE WORK TO BE DONE. THE

02:26:06.157 --> 02:26:07.825
WATER BOARD HAS ISSUED TERM

02:26:07.892 --> 02:26:08.726
NINETY ONE CURTAILMENTS BUT

02:26:08.793 --> 02:26:10.528
THAT APPLIES TO A VERY SMALL

02:26:10.595 --> 02:26:11.295
SUBSET WATER USERS IN THE BAY

02:26:11.362 --> 02:26:13.264
DELTA. AND EVEN AS WATER

02:26:13.331 --> 02:26:14.298
QUALITY STANDARDS ARE BEING

02:26:14.365 --> 02:26:16.501
VIOLATED AND SAM OR FACING

02:26:16.567 --> 02:26:18.035
LETHAL WATER TEMPERATURES THIS

02:26:18.102 --> 02:26:19.871
WINTER THIS FALL AND SUMMER.

02:26:19.937 --> 02:26:20.972
THE STATE BOARD HAS NOT ISSUED

02:26:21.038 --> 02:26:23.674
WIDESPREAD CURTAILMENT ORDERS

02:26:23.741 --> 02:26:24.208
LIKE THEY DID IN THE LAST

02:26:24.275 --> 02:26:25.476
DROUGHT. STATE BOARD HAS THE

02:26:25.543 --> 02:26:26.344
LEGAL AUTHORITY AND THE

02:26:26.410 --> 02:26:27.879
RESPONSIBILITY TO CURTAIL WATER

02:26:27.945 --> 02:26:30.081
DIVERSIONS INCLUDING PRE

02:26:30.148 --> 02:26:30.715
NINETEEN FOURTEEN WATER RIGHTS

02:26:30.781 --> 02:26:31.682
HOLDERS TO PROTECT FISH AND

02:26:31.749 --> 02:26:33.351
WILDLIFE AND THE PUBLIC TRUST.

02:26:33.417 --> 02:26:34.785
THAT IT ALREADY HAS AN UP SELL

02:26:34.852 --> 02:26:38.422
A PUBLIC WORKS INCLUDING A

02:26:38.489 --> 02:26:39.023
TWENTY TWENTY DECISION IN THE

02:26:39.090 --> 02:26:40.825
STANFORD BEING A CASE. WE THINK

02:26:40.892 --> 02:26:42.193
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE STATE

02:26:42.260 --> 02:26:43.861
FOR TAKE ACTION TO START. FOR

02:26:43.928 --> 02:26:45.863
TAILING WATER RIGHTS. BECAUSE

02:26:45.930 --> 02:26:47.064
NO WATER RATES IN CALIFORNIA

02:26:47.131 --> 02:26:48.533
ARE SUPERIOR TO THE PUBLIC

02:26:48.599 --> 02:26:50.234
TRUST. AND EXTINCTION IS

02:26:50.301 --> 02:26:52.537
FOREVER. UPDATING WATER QUALITY

02:26:52.603 --> 02:26:53.971
STANDARDS WILL ALSO HELP

02:26:54.038 --> 02:26:56.607
BECAUSE TODAY. THE STATE AND

02:26:56.674 --> 02:26:57.308
FEDERAL WATER PROJECTS ARE

02:26:57.375 --> 02:26:58.609
LARGELY THE ONLY WATER USERS

02:26:58.676 --> 02:27:00.011
HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE TO MEETING

02:27:00.077 --> 02:27:02.180
WATER QUALITY STANDARDS. AND

02:27:02.246 --> 02:27:03.247
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IN A YEAR

02:27:03.314 --> 02:27:04.649
LIKE THIS EVERYONE HAS TO

02:27:04.715 --> 02:27:08.819
CONTRIBUTE. IN CONCLUSION

02:27:08.886 --> 02:27:10.254
UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA'S FISH

02:27:10.321 --> 02:27:11.455
AND WILDLIFE IS A REPEAT OF THE

02:27:11.522 --> 02:27:13.758
DISASTROUS CONDITIONS IN TWENTY

02:27:13.824 --> 02:27:14.592
FOURTEEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN.

02:27:14.659 --> 02:27:16.494
BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S REPEATING

02:27:16.561 --> 02:27:17.094
MANY OF THE SAME MISTAKES FROM

02:27:17.161 --> 02:27:19.063
THE PRIOR DROUGHT. THE STATE'S

02:27:19.130 --> 02:27:20.431
PLAN FOR DROUGHT ALL TOO OFTEN

02:27:20.498 --> 02:27:21.732
SEEMS TO FOCUS ON TRAINING

02:27:21.799 --> 02:27:22.700
RESERVOIRS AND PRAYING FOR

02:27:22.767 --> 02:27:24.468
RAIN. WAIVING ENVIRONMENTAL

02:27:24.535 --> 02:27:26.070
PROTECTIONS THAT ARE ALREADY

02:27:26.137 --> 02:27:26.971
TOO WEAK TO PROTECT OUR NATIVE

02:27:27.038 --> 02:27:28.539
FISH AND WILDLIFE. AND DRIVING

02:27:28.606 --> 02:27:30.007
FISH AND WILDLIFE TO THE BRINK

02:27:30.074 --> 02:27:32.009
OF EXTINCTION. AND POTENTIALLY

02:27:32.076 --> 02:27:34.579
TO EXTINCTION. THIS FAILURE TO

02:27:34.645 --> 02:27:36.147
PLAN FOR DROUGHTS AND UPDATE

02:27:36.214 --> 02:27:37.215
OUR WATER QUALITY STANDARDS

02:27:37.281 --> 02:27:38.683
DOESN'T JUST HARMONY TO FISH

02:27:38.749 --> 02:27:40.351
AND WILDLIFE. IT ALSO HARMS

02:27:40.418 --> 02:27:41.619
NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES

02:27:41.686 --> 02:27:43.387
THOUSANDS OF FISHING JOBS AND

02:27:43.454 --> 02:27:44.889
COMMUNITIES IN THE DELTA THAT

02:27:44.956 --> 02:27:45.690
ARE FACING HARMFUL ALGAL

02:27:45.756 --> 02:27:47.725
BLOOMS. WE CAN AND MUST DO

02:27:47.792 --> 02:27:49.360
BETTER BECAUSE OF NEXT YEAR'S

02:27:49.427 --> 02:27:51.062
ALSO DRIVE THE DEVASTATION THAT

02:27:51.128 --> 02:27:53.164
WE FORESEE THIS YEAR. WILL BE

02:27:53.231 --> 02:27:55.266
FAR WORSE. THANK YOU FOR THE

02:27:55.333 --> 02:27:56.901

FOUNDATION AND A MEMBER OF THE

02:29:11.542 --> 02:29:13.577
CALIFORNIA WATER COMMISSION. AS

02:29:13.644 --> 02:29:15.046
I TOLD PRESIDENT OBAMA WHEN I

02:29:15.112 --> 02:29:16.347
VISITED WHEN HE VISITED THE

02:29:16.414 --> 02:29:18.449
VALLEY IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN

02:29:18.516 --> 02:29:19.750
DURING THE LAST DROUGHT THERE

02:29:19.817 --> 02:29:21.085
ARE THREE THINGS THAT MAKE

02:29:21.152 --> 02:29:23.954
FARMING WORK IN CALIFORNIA. SO

02:29:24.021 --> 02:29:29.293
OIL WATER AND PEOPLE. REMOVE

02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:31.128
ANY OF THE THREE COMPONENTS AND

02:29:31.195 --> 02:29:32.630
CALIFORNIA WOULD NOT BE THE TOP

02:29:32.697 --> 02:29:34.532
PRODUCING AGRICULTURAL STATE IN

02:29:34.598 --> 02:29:35.966
THE NATION. NOR COULD WE

02:29:36.033 --> 02:29:37.601
PROVIDE CALIFORNIANS IN THE

02:29:37.668 --> 02:29:39.704
NATION TE SECURITY OF KNOWING

02:29:39.770 --> 02:29:40.971
THAT ITS FRUITS AND VEGETABLES

02:29:41.038 --> 02:29:42.073
WILL BE ON THE SHELVES

02:29:42.139 --> 02:29:44.041
AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE. AND

02:29:44.108 --> 02:29:46.410
PRODUCED ADDED IN AN

ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND MANNER.

02:29:48.412 --> 02:29:49.980
THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC

02:29:50.047 --> 02:29:51.716
TAUGHT US MANY THINGS BUT ONE

02:29:51.782 --> 02:29:53.084
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT LESSONS

02:29:53.150 --> 02:29:54.418
LEARNED WAS THAT THE FOOD

02:29:54.485 --> 02:29:57.688
SUPPLY CHAIN MUST BE PRESERVED.

02:29:57.755 --> 02:29:59.090
IRVING THAT FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN

02:29:59.156 --> 02:30:00.524
MEANS THAT WE MUST PROTECT

02:30:00.591 --> 02:30:02.993
THOSE THREE COMPONENTS SOIL

02:30:03.060 --> 02:30:05.062
WATER AND PEOPLE ESPECIALLY

02:30:05.129 --> 02:30:07.598
DURING THE DROUGHT. MOST

02:30:07.665 --> 02:30:09.166
NATURAL DISASTERS ARE QUITE

02:30:09.233 --> 02:30:11.402
OBVIOUS HERE KINGS UPROOT TREES

02:30:11.469 --> 02:30:13.404
DISPLACED POWER LINES WELL

02:30:13.471 --> 02:30:14.839
FIRES WIPE OUT HOMES AND

02:30:14.905 --> 02:30:16.674
LANDSCAPES EARTHQUAKES SHAKE

02:30:16.741 --> 02:30:18.676
THE VERY GROUND WE WALK ON

02:30:18.743 --> 02:30:20.945
DROUGHT IS DIFFERENT. ON MY OWN

02:30:21.011 --> 02:30:24.448
FARM WE SEE ON PLANTED FEELS.

02:30:24.515 --> 02:30:25.816
WE ARE WE ARE NOT ABLE TO GROW

02:30:25.883 --> 02:30:28.185
CROPS THERE'S NO WATER THERE'S

02:30:28.252 --> 02:30:30.955
NO CROPS THERE'S NO PEOPLE. I

02:30:31.021 --> 02:30:32.056
CALL IT SILENT SPRING IN THE

02:30:32.123 --> 02:30:34.592
FIELDS AND RIGHT NOW OF MORE

02:30:34.658 --> 02:30:36.827
THAN 25% OF MY FARM IS LAID

02:30:36.894 --> 02:30:39.797
FALLOW. CALIFORNIA'S LAST

02:30:39.864 --> 02:30:40.931
DROUGHT WAS ONE OF THE MOST

02:30:40.998 --> 02:30:42.867
SEVERE IN OUR HISTORY. TESTED

02:30:42.933 --> 02:30:44.835
ALL ASPECTS OF OUR OF WATER

02:30:44.902 --> 02:30:46.370

SOLUTIONS. BUT ALSO LAYING BARE

02:30:50.207 --> 02:30:52.309
THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THAT

02:30:52.376 --> 02:30:55.579
STILL EXIST. FIVE CONSECUTIVE

02:30:55.646 --> 02:30:57.214
DRY WINTER SHUT OFF WATER

02:30:57.281 --> 02:30:58.349
DELIVERIES TO MANY A

02:30:58.416 --> 02:31:00.017
COMMUNITIES AND FARMS IN THE

02:31:00.084 --> 02:31:01.685
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY FOR TWO

02:31:01.752 --> 02:31:03.687
CONSECUTIVE YEARS FORCING THE

02:31:03.754 --> 02:31:05.523
REGION TO SOLELY RELY ON

02:31:05.589 --> 02:31:07.892
GROUNDWATER AQUIFERS. FOR WATER%

02:31:07.958 --> 02:31:10.861
SUPPLY. WHICH IN TURN HAD OTHER

NEGATIVE OF NEGATIVE AFFECTS

02:31:13.030 --> 02:31:14.799
INCLUDING IMPAIRED DRINKING

02:31:14.865 --> 02:31:18.569
WATER QUALITY DRY WELLS AND

02:31:18.636 --> 02:31:21.939
DAMAGED HIS INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:31:22.006 --> 02:31:24.842
FARMERS FOLLOWED AN ESTIMATED

02:31:24.909 --> 02:31:25.476
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF

02:31:25.543 --> 02:31:27.745
FARMLAND ABOUT 10% OF THE FARM

LAND IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY

02:31:29.513 --> 02:31:32.516
AND A 45% INCREASE OF STATEWIDE

02:31:32.583 --> 02:31:34.552
ANNUAL FELLOW ACREAGE. THE

02:31:34.618 --> 02:31:36.620
TOTAL ECONOMIC IMPACT TECH

02:31:36.687 --> 02:31:38.355
RECALLED HER IN TWO THOUSAND

02:31:38.422 --> 02:31:39.690
FIFTEEN WAS TWO POINT SEVEN

02:31:39.757 --> 02:31:43.461
BILLION DOLLAR LOSS WITH TWENTY

02:31:43.527 --> 02:31:44.995
ONE THOUSAND JOBS BEING LOST

02:31:45.062 --> 02:31:47.264
WHICH AMOUNT 25% OF

02:31:47.331 --> 02:31:49.533
AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYMENT. LET ME

02:31:49.600 --> 02:31:52.436
REPEAT THAT TWENTY ONE THOUSAND

02:31:52.503 --> 02:31:55.339
JOBS LOST MOSTLY FARMWORKERS.

02:31:55.406 --> 02:31:56.640
THAT'S TWENTY ONE THOUSAND

02:31:56.707 --> 02:31:58.275
CALIFORNIANS WHO NO LONGER HAVE

02:31:58.342 --> 02:32:00.211
THE SECURITY OF A JOB TO FEED

02:32:00.277 --> 02:32:04.148
THEIR FAMILIES. AND FOR NO

02:32:04.215 --> 02:32:05.649
OTHER REASON THAN LACK OF

02:32:05.716 --> 02:32:08.452
AVAILABLE WATER. IMPORTANTLY

02:32:08.519 --> 02:32:10.588
THESE JOB LOSSES COINCIDE WITH

02:32:10.654 --> 02:32:11.889
SOME OF THE MOST ECONOMICALLY

02:32:11.956 --> 02:32:13.591
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN

02:32:13.657 --> 02:32:15.993
CALIFORNIA AS COMMUNITIES IN

02:32:16.060 --> 02:32:17.394
THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WITH

02:32:17.461 --> 02:32:21.131
POVERTY LEVELS OVER 75% ARE

02:32:21.198 --> 02:32:22.800
THOSE MOST IMPACTED BY JOB

02:32:22.867 --> 02:32:24.768
LOSSES RESULTING FROM LAND

02:32:24.835 --> 02:32:27.338
FOLLOWING. AND THE IMPACTS OF

02:32:27.404 --> 02:32:29.573
THE OF THE LAST TROUT WERE NOT

02:32:29.640 --> 02:32:31.408
LIMITED TO ECONOMIC LOSSES. THE

02:32:31.475 --> 02:32:34.345
WORST SEVERE. PHYSICAL AND

02:32:34.411 --> 02:32:36.080
MENTAL HEALTH IMPACTS THE DEBT

02:32:36.146 --> 02:32:37.348
THAT RESULTED FROM THE LAST

02:32:37.414 --> 02:32:39.850
DROUGHT. A REPORT DONE BY

02:32:39.917 --> 02:32:41.285
CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY

02:32:41.352 --> 02:32:43.320
FRESNO INDICATES THAT DURING

02:32:43.387 --> 02:32:44.889
THE LAST TROUT INSTANCES OF

02:32:44.955 --> 02:32:47.057
VALLEY FEVER INCREASED BY

02:32:47.124 --> 02:32:49.927
NEARLY SEVENTY PERCENT. WEST

FOUR COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA.

02:32:58.669 --> 02:33:00.771
SUICIDES RATES INCREASED

02:33:00.838 --> 02:33:02.806
DRAMATICALLY AS HIS SOCIAL

02:33:02.873 --> 02:33:04.341
CRIMES LIKE DOMESTIC OR

02:33:04.408 --> 02:33:07.378
DOMESTIC ABUSE AND THEFT. THREE

02:33:07.444 --> 02:33:08.746
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY COUNTIES

02:33:08.812 --> 02:33:11.782
KERN MADERA KINGS REPORT THAT

02:33:11.849 --> 02:33:13.751
TWELVE POINT 5% OF THE SERVICE

02:33:13.817 --> 02:33:16.453
SURVEYED OF POPULATIONS HAVE

02:33:16.520 --> 02:33:17.855
SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL

02:33:17.922 --> 02:33:21.091
ILLNESSES. IT ALSO HAPPENS THAT

02:33:21.158 --> 02:33:22.526
THESE COUNTIES AND THE VALLEY

02:33:22.593 --> 02:33:23.961
GENERALLY HAVE THE LOWEST

02:33:24.028 --> 02:33:25.829
NUMBER OF PRACTICING PHYSICIANS

02:33:25.896 --> 02:33:28.465
PER COUNTY SO THESE COMMUNITIES

02:33:28.532 --> 02:33:30.301
ARE AMONG THE THOSE LEAST

02:33:30.367 --> 02:33:32.169
EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH THESE

02:33:32.236 --> 02:33:35.239
IMPACTS. WE KNOW THAT THE

02:33:35.306 --> 02:33:36.840
IMPACTS OF DROUGHT AS WE HAVE

02:33:36.907 --> 02:33:38.809
ONLY RECENTLY BEGUN TO RECOVER

02:33:38.876 --> 02:33:40.878
FROM THE LAST ONE. AND MAKE NO

02:33:40.945 --> 02:33:42.446
MISTAKE ABOUT IT WE ARE IN A

02:33:42.513 --> 02:33:45.816
DROUGHT. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF

02:33:45.883 --> 02:33:47.618
VERY SIGNIFICANT AND VERY REAL

02:33:47.685 --> 02:33:49.420
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE LAST

02:33:49.486 --> 02:33:51.689
DROUGHT AND THIS ONE. THE FIRST

02:33:51.755 --> 02:33:53.557
AND MARK MOST TROUBLING ONE IS

02:33:53.624 --> 02:33:55.559
THAT DURING THE LAST DROUGHT WE

02:33:55.626 --> 02:33:57.561
BEGIN TO EXPERIENCED SERIOUS

02:33:57.628 --> 02:33:59.496
IMPACT DURING THE THIRD YEAR.

02:33:59.563 --> 02:34:01.565
TODAY WE'RE ONLY IN THE SECOND

02:34:01.632 --> 02:34:03.334
YEAR AND WE HAVE NO SURFACE

02:34:03.400 --> 02:34:05.302
WATER DELIVERIES TO MANY

02:34:05.369 --> 02:34:07.037
FEDERAL WATER DISTRICTS IN THE

02:34:07.104 --> 02:34:08.606
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AND

02:34:08.672 --> 02:34:10.274
DRAMATICALLY REDUCE CREASE

02:34:10.341 --> 02:34:12.109
DELIVERIES TO THOSE SERVED IN

02:34:12.176 --> 02:34:14.011
THE STATE WATER PROVIDE THE

02:34:14.078 --> 02:34:15.779
STATE WATER PROJECT. FROM THAT

02:34:15.846 --> 02:34:17.815
STANDPOINT IT SEEMS LIKE WE'VE

02:34:17.881 --> 02:34:20.117
TAKEN A STEP BACKWARDS. FURTHER

02:34:20.184 --> 02:34:22.186
AS I MENTIONED EARLIER DURING

02:34:22.252 --> 02:34:23.687
THE LAST DROUGHT FARMERS WERE

02:34:23.754 --> 02:34:25.756
ABLE TO RELY ON GROUNDWATER TO

02:34:25.823 --> 02:34:27.891
GROW ROPS WHEN SERVICE WATER

02:34:27.958 --> 02:34:29.860
WAS NOT DELIVERED. HOWEVER

02:34:29.927 --> 02:34:31.762
PUMPING GROUNDWATER TO

02:34:31.829 --> 02:34:32.930
COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF

02:34:32.997 --> 02:34:34.832
SURFACE WATER WILL NO LONGER BE

02:34:34.898 --> 02:34:37.735
AVAILABLE. GOV GIVEN THE

02:34:37.801 --> 02:34:39.403
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

02:34:39.470 --> 02:34:40.904
SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER

02:34:40.971 --> 02:34:43.907
MANAGEMENT ACT OF TWO THOUSAND

02:34:43.974 --> 02:34:47.444
FIFTEEN WHAT WE CALL SIGMA.

02:34:47.511 --> 02:34:49.313
GIVEN THE FUTURE CONSTRAINTS WE

02:34:49.380 --> 02:34:51.281
MUST BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:34:51.348 --> 02:34:53.517
WE DESPERATELY NEED SO WE ARE

02:34:53.584 --> 02:34:55.686
ABLE TO MOVE AND SAVE THE WATER

02:34:55.753 --> 02:34:57.655
TO GET. IN THE WAY YOURS AND

02:34:57.721 --> 02:35:00.491
USE THAT WATER IN THE DRY YEARS

02:35:00.557 --> 02:35:02.660
WE KNOW WILL COME. THIS MEANS

02:35:02.726 --> 02:35:04.228
INVESTMENTS AND CONVEYANCE

02:35:04.294 --> 02:35:06.563
SURFACE WATER STORAGE AND APPLE

02:35:06.630 --> 02:35:09.299
FOR RECHARGE NOT IN FIVE YEARS

02:35:09.366 --> 02:35:13.070
BUT TODAY. ON TO MY FAVORITE

02:35:13.137 --> 02:35:15.739
PART HOW DO WE DO BETTER FOR

02:35:15.806 --> 02:35:18.308
TODAY AND FOR THE FUTURE. IN

02:35:18.375 --> 02:35:19.743
THE SHORT TERM THERE ARE FEW

02:35:19.810 --> 02:35:21.512
POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS THAT CAN

02:35:21.578 --> 02:35:24.014
IMMEDIATELY DELIVER BENEFITS TO

02:35:24.081 --> 02:35:26.183
THE COMMUNITIES MOST IN NEED.

02:35:26.250 --> 02:35:27.418
THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR

02:35:27.484 --> 02:35:29.219
SHOULD IMMEDIATELY AND PASSED

02:35:29.286 --> 02:35:30.954
THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FUNDING

02:35:31.021 --> 02:35:33.657
POSSIBLE. INTO SHOVEL READY

02:35:33.724 --> 02:35:35.559
PROJECTS THAT CAN IMPROVE THE

02:35:35.626 --> 02:35:37.695
WATER SUPPLY FOR THOSE FARMS

02:35:37.761 --> 02:35:39.963
COMMUNITIES AND ECOSYSTEMS THAT

02:35:40.030 --> 02:35:42.132
HAVE MOST BEEN IMPACTED BY THE

02:35:42.199 --> 02:35:44.468
DROUGHT WITH. AND WITHIN

02:35:44.535 --> 02:35:47.504
EIGHTEEN MONTHS. FOR EXAMPLE

02:35:47.571 --> 02:35:50.140
&lt;c.magenta&gt;OS BANOS CREEK RECLAMATION D.&lt;/c&gt;

02:35:50.207 --> 02:35:51.875
W. R. CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS

MAINTAINED THE LOS MANIC STREET

02:35:53.777 --> 02:35:56.113
DETENTION RESERVOIR AS A

02:35:56.180 --> 02:35:57.081
DETENTION FLOOD CONTROL

02:35:57.147 --> 02:35:59.216
RESERVOIR MEANING WATER IS HELD

02:35:59.283 --> 02:36:00.751
IN THE RESERVOIR UNTIL IT

02:36:00.818 --> 02:36:03.320
EVAPORATES. INSTEAD THE

02:36:03.387 --> 02:36:04.688
OPERATIONS OF THE RESERVOIR

02:36:04.755 --> 02:36:06.356
COULD BE MODIFIED TO IMPROVE

02:36:06.423 --> 02:36:08.258
GROUNDWATER RECHARGE BY

02:36:08.325 --> 02:36:09.927
INSTALLING A PIPELINE AND PUMP

02:36:09.993 --> 02:36:12.663
STATION TO RELEASE FLOWS FROM

02:36:12.730 --> 02:36:14.598
THE RESERVOIR INTO LOS BANOS

02:36:14.665 --> 02:36:16.300
CREEK. IMPROVING WHAT

02:36:16.366 --> 02:36:18.402
GROUNDWATER RECHARGE WATERSIDE

02:36:18.469 --> 02:36:20.938
A SUPPLY RELIABILITY AND

02:36:21.004 --> 02:36:23.073
HABITAT. FOUR TWO POINT NINE

02:36:23.140 --> 02:36:24.408
MILLION ITS ESTIMATE THIS

02:36:24.475 --> 02:36:26.510
PROJECT COULD GENERATE NEARLY

02:36:26.577 --> 02:36:27.111
EIGHT THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF

02:36:27.177 --> 02:36:28.879
GROUND WATER RECHARGE IN WET

02:36:28.946 --> 02:36:31.782
YEARS WATER THAT IS CRITICAL

02:36:31.849 --> 02:36:37.654
AND YEARS LIKE THE ONE WE'RE IN.

02:36:37.721 --> 02:36:39.223
SECOND THE WATER TRANSFER

02:36:39.289 --> 02:36:41.859
PROCESS. A VITAL LIFELINE FOR

02:36:41.925 --> 02:36:44.261
FARMERS LIKE ME. SHOULD BE

02:36:44.328 --> 02:36:46.864
STREAMLINED TO MOVE AS MUCH

02:36:46.930 --> 02:36:49.066
WATER FROM WILLING SELLERS TO

02:36:49.133 --> 02:36:51.001
WILLING BUYERS AS POSSIBLE WHEN

02:36:51.068 --> 02:36:53.771
IT'S NEEDED. IT DOESN'T HELP ME

02:36:53.837 --> 02:36:55.706
TO PURCHASE WATER FROM PARTNERS

02:36:55.773 --> 02:36:57.441
IF I AM ONLY ABLE TO RECEIVE

02:36:57.508 --> 02:36:59.109
THAT WATER WHEN MY PLANTS HAVE

02:36:59.176 --> 02:37:01.211
ALREADY DIED. AND IMMEDIATE

02:37:01.278 --> 02:37:03.847
EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD BE TO CUT

02:37:03.914 --> 02:37:06.350
THE GREEN TAPE BY REDUCING THE

02:37:06.416 --> 02:37:09.186
REGULATORY HURDLES WHICH WOULD

02:37:09.253 --> 02:37:11.488
EXPEDITE WATER TRANSFERS. FOR

02:37:11.555 --> 02:37:12.990
INSTANCE DURING THE LAST TROUT

02:37:13.056 --> 02:37:15.492
SEQUEL WAS WAIVED FOR CERTAIN

02:37:15.559 --> 02:37:17.361
TYPES OF INTER REGIONAL WATER

02:37:17.427 --> 02:37:19.763
TRANSFERS SIMILAR EFFORTS

02:37:19.830 --> 02:37:21.665
SHOULD BE MADE THIS YEAR.

02:37:21.732 --> 02:37:23.267
ANOTHER OPTION THAT WAS

02:37:23.333 --> 02:37:24.768
IMPLEMENTED DURING THE LAST

02:37:24.835 --> 02:37:26.603
DROUGHT IS THE INSTALLATION OF

02:37:26.670 --> 02:37:28.906
BARRIERS IN THE DELTA TO

02:37:28.972 --> 02:37:31.408
PREVENT SALT WATER INTRUSION.

02:37:31.475 --> 02:37:33.076
HOW FOR LONG TERM IN THE LONG

02:37:33.143 --> 02:37:34.444
TERM THE SOLUTIONS FOR

02:37:34.511 --> 02:37:36.246
IMPROVING CALIFORNIA'S DROUGHT

02:37:36.313 --> 02:37:38.148
RESILIENCE HAVE BEEN WELL

02:37:38.215 --> 02:37:40.017
UNDERSTOOD FOR A LONG TIME.

02:37:40.083 --> 02:37:42.586
ONLY A TEN YEAR AVERAGE THERE

02:37:42.653 --> 02:37:44.822
IS ENOUGH PRECIPITATION AND

02:37:44.888 --> 02:37:47.691
SNOWPACK TO MEET. CALIFORNIA'S

02:37:47.758 --> 02:37:50.227
DEMANDS THE CHALLENGES MOVING

02:37:50.294 --> 02:37:52.029
IT WHERE IT'S NEEDED WHEN IT'S

02:37:52.095 --> 02:37:54.164
AVAILABLE WHICH IS LIMITED

02:37:54.231 --> 02:37:57.167
DURING. LIMITED NOT A NUMBER OF

02:37:57.234 --> 02:37:59.236
YEARS AND STORING IT FOR WHEN

02:37:59.303 --> 02:38:01.071
IT'S NEEDED WHICH IS A LARGER

02:38:01.138 --> 02:38:04.141
NUMBER OF YEARS. TRADITIONALLY

02:38:04.208 --> 02:38:05.742
CALIFORNIA HAS RELIED ON THE

02:38:05.809 --> 02:38:07.511
SNOW PACK TO BE A NATURAL

02:38:07.578 --> 02:38:10.247
RESERVOIR AND THIS FIFTY

02:38:10.314 --> 02:38:14.551
HISTORICALLY HAS WORKED WELL.

02:38:14.618 --> 02:38:15.819
HOWEVER CLIMATE CHANGE MEANS

02:38:15.886 --> 02:38:18.355
THAT CALENDAR CALIFORNIA'S WHAT

02:38:18.422 --> 02:38:20.924
YEARS ARE BOTH MORE WET AND

02:38:20.991 --> 02:38:22.893
LESS FREQUENT AND IT'S A DRY

02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:24.561
YOURS ARE MORE FREQUENT AND

02:38:24.628 --> 02:38:26.697
MORE DRY. SO CALIFORNIA MUST

02:38:26.763 --> 02:38:29.766
ADAPT. THIS MEANS APPROVING THE

02:38:29.833 --> 02:38:31.435
ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT MANAGEMENT

02:38:31.501 --> 02:38:34.037
OF OUR WATER SYSTEMS MANAGING

02:38:34.104 --> 02:38:36.073
WATERSHEDS IN A COMPREHENSIVE

02:38:36.139 --> 02:38:38.475
WAY THAT HAS MULTIPLE BENEFITS

02:38:38.542 --> 02:38:41.945
INCLUDING WATER SUPPLY. IT IT

02:38:42.012 --> 02:38:44.147
MEANS BUILDING PROJECTS THERE

02:38:44.214 --> 02:38:45.549
ARE A NUMBER OF PROJECTS THAT

02:38:45.616 --> 02:38:47.251
HAVE BEEN PLANNED FOR YEARS

02:38:47.317 --> 02:38:49.786
SOME FOR DECADES THAT MUST BE

02:38:49.853 --> 02:38:52.055
FINALLY BUILT THIS MEANS

02:38:52.122 --> 02:38:53.824
RESTORING AND INCREASING

02:38:53.891 --> 02:38:55.659
CONVEYANCE CAPACITY AND

02:38:55.726 --> 02:38:56.994
INCREASING WATER STORAGE IN

CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY SOUTH

02:38:59.263 --> 02:39:01.498
OF THE DELTA. THERE ARE MANY

02:39:01.565 --> 02:39:02.866
BILLS BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE

02:39:02.933 --> 02:39:04.368
THAT WOULD ACCOMPLISH SOME OF

02:39:04.434 --> 02:39:06.236
THOSE GOALS. BUT I WILL

02:39:06.303 --> 02:39:07.971
HIGHLIGHT ONE OF THEM OF

02:39:08.038 --> 02:39:10.641

02:39:15.913 --> 02:39:17.714
MAKE A ONE TIME INVESTMENT TO

02:39:17.781 --> 02:39:19.816
RESTORE THE CONVEYANCE CAPACITY

02:39:19.883 --> 02:39:22.319
OF CALIFORNIA'S ARTERIAL CANALS

02:39:22.386 --> 02:39:24.221
WHICH HAVE LOST SIGNIFICANT

02:39:24.288 --> 02:39:26.823
CAPACITY. ADDRESSING THE

IMPACTS OF THE OF THE

02:39:28.058 --> 02:39:29.860
SUBSIDENCE ALONG THESE CANALS

02:39:29.927 --> 02:39:31.495
IS PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT

02:39:31.561 --> 02:39:34.097
STEP. TO BUILD TO BUILDING

02:39:34.164 --> 02:39:36.800

INCREASING GROUNDWATER STORAGE

02:39:55.519 --> 02:39:57.955
AND RECHARGE. THE SOLUTIONS ARE

02:39:58.021 --> 02:40:00.190
THERE. THEY'VE BEEN STUDIED FOR

02:40:00.257 --> 02:40:02.025
YEARS WE SIMPLY NEED TO HAVE

02:40:02.092 --> 02:40:03.827

CALIFORNIA HAS ALSO BEEN

02:40:33.323 --> 02:40:34.758

DIEGO WHO REALLY IS A UNIQUE

02:43:47.717 --> 02:43:49.619
REGION. WE HAVE VERY FEW

02:43:49.686 --> 02:43:51.721
NATURAL WATER RESOURCES SUCH AS

02:43:51.788 --> 02:43:53.590
GROUNDWATER AND WE GET VERY

02:43:53.657 --> 02:43:55.692
LITTLE RAINFALL- SUMMER

02:43:55.759 --> 02:43:57.194
SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT WE GET

02:43:57.260 --> 02:43:59.229
ABOUT TEN INCHES OF RAIN A YEAR

02:43:59.296 --> 02:44:01.364
THAT COMPARES TO LOS ANGELES

02:44:01.431 --> 02:44:03.166
THAT FIFTEEN INTEREST A YEAR.

02:44:03.233 --> 02:44:05.202
AND SAN FRANCISCO WHICH GETS

02:44:05.268 --> 02:44:07.504
ABOUT TWENTY ONE INCHES. SO THE

02:44:07.571 --> 02:44:09.606
MORE MAJORITY OF OUR WATER

02:44:09.673 --> 02:44:11.308
COMING INTO THE REGION TRAVEL

02:44:11.374 --> 02:44:16.279
SOME DISTANCE. ON THE COLORADO

02:44:16.346 --> 02:44:18.081
RIVER TO REACH THE WATER

02:44:18.148 --> 02:44:20.183
AUTHORITY'S AQUIDNECK SYSTEM.

02:44:20.250 --> 02:44:24.287
ABOUT- 10% OF THE WATER HOW WE

02:44:24.354 --> 02:44:26.523
USE IN THE REGION INCOME SIX

02:44:26.590 --> 02:44:27.757
HUNDRED MILES- THROUGH THE

02:44:27.824 --> 02:44:29.459
CALIFORNIA AQUEDUCT AND THE

02:44:29.526 --> 02:44:32.128
REMAINING 24% IS FROM LOCAL

02:44:32.195 --> 02:44:34.464
SUPPLIES AND THIS INCLUDES OUR

02:44:34.531 --> 02:44:36.733
SEA WATER DESALINATION PLANT IN

02:44:36.800 --> 02:44:39.069
CARLSBAD WATER PURIFICATION

02:44:39.135 --> 02:44:42.973
PROJECTS- THAT ARE CURRENTLY-

02:44:43.039 --> 02:44:45.942
THAT. CONSTRUCTED AND THOSE-

02:44:46.009 --> 02:44:47.744
COMING ONLINE AND THEN SURFACE

02:44:47.811 --> 02:44:50.046
WATER WHICH IS STORM WATER RUN

02:44:50.113 --> 02:44:54.150
OFF AGAIN- A SMALL PORTION OF

02:44:54.217 --> 02:44:55.652
THE WATER THAT WE HAVE. SO

02:44:55.719 --> 02:44:57.254
TODAY I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT WE

02:44:57.320 --> 02:44:59.055
HAVE SUFFICIENT SUPPLIES FOR

02:44:59.122 --> 02:45:01.691
THIS VERY DRY YEAR I IN FACT

02:45:01.758 --> 02:45:03.159
OUR STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT WE

02:45:03.226 --> 02:45:05.695
HAVE SUFFICIENT SUPPLIES TO-

02:45:05.762 --> 02:45:07.530
WHETHER MULTIPLE DRY YEARS IN A

02:45:07.597 --> 02:45:09.733
ROW WHICH SUPPORT OUR QUALITY

02:45:09.799 --> 02:45:11.501
OF LIFE AND OUR ECONOMY FOR

02:45:11.568 --> 02:45:14.004
DECADES TO COME. SO HOW DID WE

02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:16.506
GET HERE BACK IN NINETEEN

02:45:16.573 --> 02:45:17.073
NINETY ONE THE COUNTY WATER

02:45:17.140 --> 02:45:19.242
AUTHORITY. DISTINTIVO COUNTY

02:45:19.309 --> 02:45:21.077
WAS RELIANT ON ONE SOURCE OF

02:45:21.144 --> 02:45:25.282
WATER- FOR ABOUT 95% OF ITS

02:45:25.348 --> 02:45:27.584
WATER. AND THEN DUE TO SEVERE

02:45:27.651 --> 02:45:29.986
DROUGHTS- BECAUSE- THE SAN

02:45:30.053 --> 02:45:32.322
DIEGO REGION TO SUFFER THIRTEEN

02:45:32.389 --> 02:45:33.857
MONTHS OF SUPPLY ALLOCATION

02:45:33.923 --> 02:45:36.493
REDUCTION. THAT ADULTS A SEVERE

02:45:36.559 --> 02:45:38.428
BLOW TO THE ECONOMY AND THE

02:45:38.495 --> 02:45:40.797
QUALITY OF LIFE AND THAT

02:45:40.864 --> 02:45:46.069
HAPPENED IN THE- EARLY. IN

02:45:46.136 --> 02:45:47.637
NINETEEN NINETY. THE PAINFUL

02:45:47.704 --> 02:45:49.539
RESTRICTIONS ON WATER SUPPLY

02:45:49.606 --> 02:45:51.441
CHAIN GALVANIZED HER REGION'S

02:45:51.508 --> 02:45:52.575

LEADERS TO MAKE DEMANDED.

02:45:55.412 --> 02:45:57.347
STRATEGY THAT WOULD PREVENT

02:45:57.414 --> 02:45:59.382
SUCH A SITUATION FROM HAPPENING

02:45:59.449 --> 02:46:01.685
AGAIN IN FACT THERE WAS A RALLY

02:46:01.751 --> 02:46:03.453
IN CLIENTS THAT WE SHOULD NEVER

02:46:03.520 --> 02:46:05.588
AGAIN BE PLACED IN THIS

02:46:05.655 --> 02:46:08.091
SITUATION. TACKLING A MYRIAD OF

02:46:08.158 --> 02:46:09.492
CHALLENGES SUCH AS GROWING

02:46:09.559 --> 02:46:11.294
DEMAND FOR WATER ACROSS THE

SOUTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

02:46:14.097 --> 02:46:15.165
DROUGHTS AND IN THEIR STATE

02:46:15.231 --> 02:46:16.599
LEGAL BATTLES THE WATER

02:46:16.666 --> 02:46:18.168
AUTHORITY CAREFULLY CHARTED A

02:46:18.234 --> 02:46:19.336
NEW COURSE FOR BEATING THE

02:46:19.402 --> 02:46:21.404
REGION'S WATER NEEDS. THROUGH A

02:46:21.471 --> 02:46:24.207
VARIETY OF SOURCES NICK AND NEW

02:46:24.274 --> 02:46:26.543
OR IMPROVED FACILITIES IT WAS

02:46:26.609 --> 02:46:28.511
THE WATER SUPPLY EQUIVALENT OF

02:46:28.578 --> 02:46:31.114

TALK TO YOU FACE TO FACE I

02:58:26.529 --> 02:58:28.164
THOUGHT THAT THIS ISSUE IS. IS

02:58:28.230 --> 02:58:29.765
SO IMPORTANT FOR US BECAUSE WE

02:58:29.832 --> 02:58:31.033
HAVE BEEN SUFFERING THESE

02:58:31.100 --> 02:58:32.802
DROUGHTS FOR TOO MANY YEARS.

02:58:32.868 --> 02:58:34.503
WE'VE HAD WATER REDUCTIONS ON

02:58:34.570 --> 02:58:37.039
OUR FARMS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY

02:58:37.106 --> 02:58:38.407
PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT. IN

02:58:38.474 --> 02:58:40.142
THE MOST SEVERE ONES HAVE

02:58:40.209 --> 02:58:41.177
HAPPENED SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND

02:58:41.243 --> 02:58:43.512
NINE- SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT

02:58:43.579 --> 02:58:45.548
HAS. YOU KNOW HAS NOT REACHED

02:58:45.614 --> 02:58:47.983
MANY SOLUTIONS AND WE'RE WE'RE

02:58:48.050 --> 02:58:51.087
REALLY REALLY REACHING OUT FOR-

02:58:51.153 --> 02:58:52.421
SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO

02:58:52.488 --> 02:58:54.857
BE DONE NOW IS TO EXPEDITE

02:58:54.924 --> 02:58:56.625
TRANSFERS SO WE CAN GET THE

02:58:56.692 --> 02:58:58.294
WATER IN TIME TO GET THE CROPS

02:58:58.360 --> 02:58:59.528
TO GROW THROUGH THE SUMMER.

02:58:59.595 --> 02:59:01.330
BECAUSE WE'RE PLANTING CROPS

02:59:01.397 --> 02:59:02.798
AND WE ONLY HAVE ENOUGH WATER

02:59:02.865 --> 02:59:06.001
TO GET TO JULY. AND THE REST OF

02:59:06.068 --> 02:59:07.703
THE WATER THAT WE NEED IS HUNG

02:59:07.770 --> 02:59:10.239
UP IN THE TRANSFER. SO WE WOULD

02:59:10.306 --> 02:59:11.607
CERTAINLY APPRECIATE IF

02:59:11.674 --> 02:59:12.942
ANYTHING COULD BE DONE THERE TO

02:59:13.008 --> 02:59:15.511
EXPEDITE THAT. AND OF COURSE WE

02:59:15.578 --> 02:59:19.915
NEED THOSE LONG TERM PROJECTS-

02:59:19.982 --> 02:59:21.150
ARE SOME OF THOSE PRICE X. THAT

02:59:21.217 --> 02:59:21.851
WERE. BY THE CALIFORNIA WATER

02:59:21.917 --> 02:59:24.587
COMING. WERE UNFORTUNATELY NOT

02:59:24.653 --> 02:59:25.454
WHAT THEY WERE KIND OF UNDER

02:59:25.521 --> 02:59:27.022
FUNDED SOME OF THESE PROJECTS

02:59:27.089 --> 02:59:30.059
NEEDED MORE FUNDS. OF THE

02:59:30.126 --> 02:59:32.628
PRIVATE THE PROPONENTS. DID NOT

02:59:32.695 --> 02:59:35.431
HAVE THE FUNDING BECAUSE THE OF

02:59:35.498 --> 02:59:38.300
PROP ONE FUNDS FELL SHORTER. OF

02:59:38.367 --> 02:59:40.469
BOARD FOR THEM THEN THEY REALLY

02:59:40.536 --> 02:59:42.238
NEEDED TO GET TO MAKE IT GO.

02:59:42.304 --> 02:59:44.140
AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT

02:59:44.206 --> 02:59:45.441
THIS IS A GOOD TIME FOR THE

02:59:45.508 --> 02:59:46.008
STATE AND THE FEDERAL

02:59:46.075 --> 02:59:48.244
GOVERNMENT TO COME IN. AND HELP

02:59:48.310 --> 02:59:48.911
THEM WITH THOSE ADDITIONAL

02:59:48.978 --> 02:59:51.113
FUNDS. OF PROJECTS LIKE

02:59:51.180 --> 02:59:52.781
TEMPERANCE FLAT. GOT A VERY

02:59:52.848 --> 02:59:54.683
PITIFUL AMOUNT I THINK THEY GOT

02:59:54.750 --> 02:59:56.085
LIKE A HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN

02:59:56.152 --> 02:59:58.154
MILLION. AND THE PROJECT COST

02:59:58.220 --> 03:00:00.389
LIKE MAYBE TWO TWO BILLION. SO

03:00:00.456 --> 03:00:02.224
THEY WERE WELL WELL SHORT OF

03:00:02.291 --> 03:00:03.792
FUNDING AND THAT'S SOMETHING

03:00:03.859 --> 03:00:05.561
THAT CAN BE DONE NOW HOPEFULLY.

03:00:05.628 --> 03:00:08.364
AND MAYBE GET THOSE PROJECTS

03:00:08.430 --> 03:00:10.633
STARTED. THANK YOU SO MUCH

03:00:10.699 --> 03:00:12.635
THANK YOU. THANK YOU I DO HAVE

03:00:12.701 --> 03:00:15.271
A QUESTION FOR SANDY WITH THE

03:00:15.337 --> 03:00:16.672
SAN DIEGO COUNTY WATER AGENCY

03:00:16.739 --> 03:00:18.807
AND- THIS IS IN RELATION TO

03:00:18.874 --> 03:00:21.777
COLORADO RIVER- DROUGHT

03:00:21.844 --> 03:00:23.379
CIRCUMSTANCES I MEAN HOW IS THE

03:00:23.445 --> 03:00:25.114
WATER AGENCY AND HOW DO YOU SEE

03:00:25.181 --> 03:00:28.484
OTHER. WATER AGENCIES- THAT

03:00:28.551 --> 03:00:31.053
DEPEND ON A RIVER ALLOCATIONS

03:00:31.120 --> 03:00:34.023
ARE PREPARING. AT THIS MOMENT

03:00:34.089 --> 03:00:37.693

THOSE CUTBACKS WILL BE OF THE

03:00:44.300 --> 03:00:46.869
STATE OF ARIZONA- THERE'S A LOT

03:00:46.936 --> 03:00:49.271
OF EFFORT TALKING ABOUT WATER

ON THE COLORADO RIVER AND SO-

03:00:58.447 --> 03:00:59.949
THERE'S A HUGE EFFORT IN THAT

03:01:00.015 --> 03:01:03.285
REGARD- I THINK THAT- ONE OF

03:01:03.352 --> 03:01:05.354
THE THINGS THAT I HOPE HAPPENS

03:01:05.421 --> 03:01:07.790

BE ABLE TO USE THAT WATER- WORK

03:01:26.642 --> 03:01:29.678
APPROPRIATELY- WHEN WE NEED TO

03:01:29.745 --> 03:01:32.381
AND IT COULD PROVIDE A SOLUTION

03:01:32.448 --> 03:01:35.417
