MS AGUIAR-CURRY THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AB FIVE THIRTY FIVE CLARIFIES EXISTING LAW THE PROHIBITS THE LABELING OF ALL OF WELL AS FROM CALIFORNIA. LIVE A 100% OF THE OIL IS FROM OLIVES GROWN IN THE STATE. MEMBERS THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT ONE COMPANY IT'S ABOUT AN ENTIRE INDUSTRY MADE UP OF MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED FARMERS. FORTY FIVE MILLS. THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING TO MAKE CALIFORNIA ALL OF WORLD THE FINEST IN THE WORLD. IT'S A GROWING INDUSTRY AS PHARMACY CROPPING CHANGES. AS A RESULT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND LESS ACCESS TO WATER ALL OF US ARE GROWING IN POPULARITY. WITH THAT IS BUT THAT IS ALSO THE GROWTH IN ALL OF OIL FROM CALIFORNIA. THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN LAW CENTER LOS WALK CARILLO. TO CREATE THE CALIFORNIA OLIVE OIL COMMISSION. THE COMMISSION WAS CREATED WITH UNANIMOUS SUPPORT FROM THE INDUSTRY. OUR FOCUS OF THAT INDUSTRY AT THE TIME WAS TO DISTINGUISH THE PURITY OF CALIFORNIA ALL OF OIL FROM IMPORTS ALLEGED TO CONTAIN COUNTERFEIT INGREDIENTS. AND THEREBY PENETRATE THE US MARKET WHICH AT THE TIME CONSISTENT MOST ENTIRELY OF IMPORTS. CALIFORNIA IMPURITY FOR THE MARK HE WORDS USED WHEN THE COMMISSION WAS FORMED AND THE QUALITY STANDARDS LATER DEVELOPED. AB FIVE THIRTY FIVE BUILT UPON THE HISTORY BY CLOSING A LOOPHOLE IN EXISTING LAW. SINCE NINETEEN FORTY THREE CALIFORNIA LAW HAS REGULATED THE LABELING OF ALL OF WORLD IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THE LAW WAS CHANGED TO PROTECT THE USE OF THE TERM CALIFORNIA. AB FIVE THIRTY FIVE DOES NOT CHANGE THE RULES EXISTING LAW SEEKS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM INHERENTLY DECEPTIVE LABELS. AND AB FIVE THIRTY FIVE EXTENDS UP PROTECTION. I'VE HEARD FROM HUNDREDS OF SMALL GROWERS ALL OF OIL PRODUCERS AND AG ORGANIZATIONS ASKING US TO PROTECT THE CALIFORNIA BRAND FOR ALL THESE REASONS. WHY ESTABLISHING STRONGER LABELING GUIDELINES FOR ALL OF OUR PRODUCERS AB FIVE THIRTY FIVE WILL ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA BRAND IS PROTECTED AND CONSUMERS KNOW WHEN A LABEL SAYS CALIFORNIA AND THE ORAL IS A 100% CALIFORNIA. A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM RURAL CALIFORNIA MAKE A GREAT POINT OF BRAGGING ABOUT CALIFORNIA ACCURATE NUMBER CULTURE. AS TO WHY NOW IS THEIR CHANCE TO SUPPORT THE FARMERS THEY CLAIM TO REPRESENT. A LOT OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY VOTED TO INCREASE STANDARDS AND WAGES FOR THE INDUSTRY NOW IS THE TIME TO PROVE YOU'LL ALSO PROTECT THESE FARMERS AGAINST COUNTRIES WHO DON'T MEET OUR STANDARDS. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU IS A YEAR MISTER GALLAGHER YOUR RECOGNIZE. THEY YOU MISTER SPEAKER MA'AM- I GREATLY RESPECT MY COLLEAGUE. FROM WINNERS WHO WE WORKED ON MANY ISSUES TOGETHER- MANY RURAL ISSUES TOGETHER WATER ISSUES AGRICULTURAL ISSUES BUT I MUST RESPECTFULLY AND PASSIONATELY DISAGREE WITH THIS MEASURE IN THIS BILL. AND I PLEAD WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS FLOOR TODAY. THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY. THAT WE PASS A BILL THAT IS TARGETED TOWARDS EXACTLY ONE BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TARGETING THEM AND PUTTING THEM AT A GROSS DISADVANTAGE. AND I WANT YOU TO ASK YOURSELF IF THIS HAPPENED TO YOU IN YOUR DISTRICT AND ONE OF YOUR BUSINESSES WAS SPECIFICALLY TARGETED BY A BILL WHAT WOULD YOU WANT. DONE LET ME BACK UP A LITTLE BIT AND TALK ABOUT THIS BUSINESS CALIFORNIA OLIVE RANCH HASBEEN IN BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. EMPLOYS CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. CONTRACTS WITH CALIFORNIA ALL OF GROWERS. IN THE STATE TO TALK ABOUT HOW THESE PEOPLE SOMEHOW ARE NOT A CALIFORNIA BASED BUSINESS IS COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS. NO THEY DON'T SUPPORT THE CALIFORNIA ALL OF INDUSTRY IS ALSO RIDICULOUS. THEY'VE HAD THIS NAME FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS AND TODAY WERE SAYING THEY CAN'T HAVE THAT NAME IF YOU PASS THIS BILL. YOU'RE SAYING AND THEIR BRAND NAME THEY CAN'T USE THE WORD CALIFORNIA ALL OF RANCH. ON THEIR LABELS THEY SELL A THEIR BRANDS AND THEY ALSO SELL A BLENDED OLIVE OIL JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE INDUSTRY DOES THIS PEOPLE WITH 1100% CALIFORNIA GROWN THEY ALSO BLENDED VERSIONS THEY DO THE SAME THING BUT THEY HAPPEN TO HAVE THE NAME FOR TWENTY PLUS YEARS A TRADEMARKED. YOU HAVE GOT IT FROM THE CALIFORNIA SECRETARY OF STATE WHEN THEY FORM THE CORPORATION. OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO OF HAD THAT NAME FOREVER BUT BUT THIS LEGISLATURE TODAY IF YOU PASS THIS BILL YOU'RE GOING TO SAY THEY CAN'T HAVE THAT NAME ANYMORE. THEY CAN'T USE IT. ON THEIR BRANDS THAT THEY'VE BEEN SELLING IN CALIFORNIA AGAIN USING CALIFORNIA GROWERS THAT THEY CONTRACT WITH USING CALIFORNIA EMPLOYEES OVER A HUNDRED FORTY IN CALIFORNIA WORKING FOR THIS COMPANY. IS THAT THE KIND OF PERSON THAT WE'RE GOING TO SAID I HOPE I REALLY HOPE NOT. AND I'M BEGGING YOU MEMBERS DON'T PASS THIS BILL. JUST BECAUSE- THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE WE'VE ASKED FOR REASONABLE AMENDMENTS. TO THIS BILL TO ENSURE THAT IT DOESN'T INFRINGE ON THE TRADEMARK NAME ON A TRADEMARK BRAND NAME FOR A CALIFORNIA BUSINESS MAKE THE AMENDMENT. TAKE THE REASONABLE AMENDMENTS. BUT DON'T MOVE THIS FORWARD TODAY MEMBERS ASK YOU TO VOTE NO THANK YOU. MS RUBIO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB FIVE THIRTY FIVE AN ISSUE CONTINUOUSLY CHAMPIONED BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM WINTERS. SINCE I WAS ELECTED I HAVE MADE IT A PRIORITY TO RECOGNIZE AN ADVOCATE FOR CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE AGRICULTURAL FOOTPRINT. THREE VARIETY OF MEETINGS AND TOURS I HAVE DEVELOPED A PROFOUND UNDERSTANDING OF ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST RENOWNED INDUSTRIES ARE FARMERS RIGHTFULLY TAKE PRIDE IN GROWING CALIFORNIAPRODUCTS RECOGNIZED WORLDWIDE. THIS BILL IS SIMPLY LOOKING TO PROTECT THE REPUTATION AND NAME THEY HAVE CREATED OVER THE YEARS TO ENSURE THE CONSUMER IS GETTING CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS WHEN THEY SEE CALIFORNIA ON THE LABEL I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. THANK YOU MISTER VOC NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION. ON THE BILL MISS AGUIAR-CURRY YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU. MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE THOUGHTFUL DEBATE I'VE LEFT SOME QUESTIONS FOR MY CLOTHES AND I THINK EVERYONE OF US AGREES THE CALIFORNIA FARMERS WORK WITH THE MOST PROTECTIVE CONSUMER ENVIRONMENTAL LABOR STANDARDS. IN THE WORLD. THIS BILL IS MEANT TO SUPPORT THEM WHEN PLAYERS IN THE FALL OF MARKETS ATTEMPT TO BYPASS THOSE STANDARDS IS ALL BOILS FROM OTHER PLACES. AND PRESENT THEMSELVES OF CALIFORNIANS. CURRENT LAW SAYS IF ANY ALL OF OUR PROCESS SOLD OFFERED FOR SALE GIVEN AWAY OR POSSESSING CALIFORNIA. THAT INDICATES ON ITS LABEL CALIFORNIA ALL OF WORLD OR WORDS OF SIMILAR IMPACT THAT INDICATE THE CALIFORNIA IS THE SOURCE OF THE OIL A 100% OF THAT OIL SHALL BE DERIVED FROM OLIVES GROWN IN CALIFORNIA. THIS LANGUAGE WAS UNIVERSALLY SUPPORTED WHEN IT BECAME LAW INCLUDING THE MOST VOCAL OPPONENT OF THIS BILL. THEY CHANGED OWNERS. AND DECIDED NOT TO OFFER THE SAME PRODUCT ANYMORE THAT'S THEIR DECISION AND IT'S THEIR RIGHT TO DO THAT. BUT IF YOU'RE NO LONGER MEET THE STANDARDS IN THE LAW YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO USE THE WORDS OF SIMILAR IMPORT THAT INDICATE THE CALIFORNIA BOARD REGION WITH IN CALIFORNIA IS THE SOURCE OF THE OIL. I'VE BEEN ASKED ABOUT WORKING WITH OPPONENTS THE POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS INCLUDING THE LAST FEW WEEKS AFTER HEALTH COMMUNITY WE'VE ENGAGE WITH THE OPPONENTS AND HAVE EVERY INTENTION TO DO SO FURTHER. TO DATE HOWEVER THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS WOULD DO NOTHING BUT REMOVE THE CLARIFICATION WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE BILL AND EXEMPT INDIVIDUALS. I CANNOT DO EITHER. BUT I ASSURE MY QUALITIES I'M PAUL THESE I'M NOT DONE TRYING TO FIND A PATH. I'VE BEEN ASKED ABOUT LITIGATION DUE TO FEDERAL LEGAL ISSUES THE FEDERAL COURTS HAVE RULED THAT MISLEADING COMMERCIAL SPEECH IS NOT PROTECTED BY THE CONSTITUTION. OUR OWN ATTORNEYS IN THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL HAVE NOT FLAG THIS BILL FOR A RISK OF CONFLICT WITH FEDERAL LAW WHEN I INTRODUCED THE SAME BILL LAST YEAR NOR AGAIN THIS YEAR. WE ARE WAITING FOR AN OPINION TO LAY THIS TO REST BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL LATER THIS SUMMER. I ALSO WANT TO ADDRESS THE MIS CHARACTERIZATIONS OF MY MOTIVES BY MY OPPONENTS AND EVEN MY COLLEAGUES. I TAKE GREAT EXCEPTION TO THE SUGGESTION BY ANYONE THAT THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO TIP THE SCALES OF COMPETITION TOWARD OR AWAY FROM INDIVIDUAL PARTIES. I WOULD NEVER EVER USE MY OFFICE NOR THIS FLOOR TO PROMOTE OR UNDERMINE INDIVIDUAL PARTIES AND I'M OFFENDED BY THE SUGGESTION OTHERWISE. MEMBERS THE LAW IS CLEAR FROM OUT OF STATE INVESTORS WANT TO IGNORE THE INTENT OF THE LAW BY BRANDING BY A BRANDING LOOPHOLE TO ACCOMPLISH EXACTLY EXACTLY WHAT WAS PROHIBITED BY THE LAW USING OUR STATE OR REGIONAL NAME UNLESS ALL ABOVE A 100% CALIFORNIA OR 85% PER REGION TO DO SO IS MISLEADING AND IF THE COMMENTS ON THE INTERNET FOR SALE FIVE.

AB THREE THREE THREE BY SENATOR KAMLAGER SIGNIFICANTLY STRENGTHENS DUE PROCESS RIGHTS BY REFORMING THE USE OF GANG ENHANCEMENTS IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. MANY OF YOU MAY BE SURPRISED TO SEE ME JACKSON THIS BILL TODAY. IF YOU WOULD CALL MY VOTING RECORD SOFT ON CRIME. AND I FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREE WITH MANY OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE BILLS THAT REACH THIS. FOR HOWEVER ALSO FUNDAMENTALLY AGREE THAT EVERY AMERICAN. USE OF A CRIME HAS A RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS. INCLUDING A FAIR TRIAL BY AN IMPARTIAL JURY. THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL CAN SPEAK FAR BETTER TO THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS PEOPLE OF COLOR HAVE EXPERIENCE BECAUSE THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM'S FAILURE TO TREAT THEM PARTIALLY. I'M SURE MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD HER PASSION ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL. AS I DID. FOR THOSE OF YOU. WHO WERE ALREADY MOVED BY HER WORDS I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL TODAY. BUT LET ME SPEAK FOR A MOMENT TO THOSE OF YOU STILL CONTEMPLATING IS THIS THE RIGHT SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. MANY OF US HAVE BEMOANED. THE WOKE CULTURE OF TODAY WHICH FINDS PEOPLE GUILTY IN THE EYE OF PUBLIC OPINION BEFORE ANYTHING BUT NATURALIZATION HAS BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD. WE SEE PARITY BETWEEN A LIBERAL COMPANY FIRING A CONSERVATIVE EMPLOYEE FOR EXPRESSING CONSERVATIVE VIEWS AND THE CONSERVATIVE COMPANY FIRING A LIBERAL PERSON FOR EXPRESSING LIBERAL VIEWS. IN A COUNTRY WHERE DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEWS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS BACKGROUNDS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE CELEBRATE. DUE PROCESS IS THE GREAT EQUALIZER TO ACT AS A BALANCE AGAINST THE TYRANNY OF THE MAJORITY. REPEAT OFFENDERS WORKING TO ADVANCE THE CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE OF STREET GANGS SHOULD FACE STIFFER PENALTIES FOR THEIR ACTIONS. HOWEVER THE CURRENT GANG ENHANCEMENT SYSTEM CREATES AN INHERENT BIAS. TO CONVICT A PERSON FOR THE UNDERLYING CRIME SIMPLY BECAUSE THE JURY KNOWS THE PROSECUTION IS SEEKING A GANG ENHANCEMENT. IF ASSEMBLED CORRECTLY JURIES ARE NOT INHERENTLY BIASED ENTITIES BUT OUR LEGAL SYSTEM DOES A POOR JOB OF KEEPING BIASES OUT OF CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. WHEN WE SEE GANG ENHANCEMENTS APPLIED DISPROPORTIONATELY PEOPLE OF COLOR WE HAVE TO ASK WHY. SO THE QUESTION IS CASES WIRE 92% OF PEOPLE WITH GANG ENHANCEMENTS IN CALIFORNIA PEOPLE OF COLOR. JUST IN CASE WE NEED A REMINDER WHITE PEOPLE CAN JOIN GANGS TO. AB THREE THREE THREE REPRESENTS AN HONEST ATEMPT. BY AN HONEST MEMBER WHO DEEPLY AND PERSONALLY CARES ABOUT THESE ISSUES. IT MAKES CHANGES TO PROCEEDINGS SO THAT ENHANCEMENTS ARE ONLY BROUGHT FORWARD AFTER DIFFERENT IS ALREADY CONVICTED. OF THE UNDERLYING CRIME. IT SIMPLY REQUIRES. THAT JURIES AVOID PRE SENTENCING SOMEONE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME IN THE PAST. THAT IS WHAT DUE PROCESS IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE EVERY AMERICAN AND THAT IS WHY I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY FOR AB. THREE THREE THREE. I THINK IT'S GREAT DOCTOR WEBER. IN THE REAR THE CHAMBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB THREE THREE THREE. A COMMON SENSE MEASURE TO RECTIFY UNJUST APPLICATION A GANG ENHANCEMENT ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. ACCORDING ACCORDING TO THE CDC OUR DATA IN AUGUST OF TWENTY NINETEEN. 90% OF INMATES WITH A GANG ENHANCEMENT WERE BLACK OR LATINO. TO BE CLEAR THESE AND. IF APPROACH BY THE WAY HAS NO EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT IT LEADS TO A DETERRENT FROM JOINING A GANG. AND NO EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT IT MAKES OUR COMMUNITY SAFER. THESE GANG ENHANCEMENT ENHANCEMENTS NOT ONLY EXTEND THE LENGTH OF SENTENCES FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS. BUT THESE ENHANCEMENTS CONTINUE TO PERPETUATE A CYCLE OF DISRUPTION IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WHICH LEAVE THE TO THE CONTINUED CREATION OF UNHEALTHY INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. AB THREE THREE THREE INSTEAD FOCUS IS ON THE REHABILITATION OF THESE OFFENDERS. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ENTIRELY CAPABLE OF BEING CONTRIBUTING MEMBERS TO OUR SOCIETY IF GIVEN THE APPROPRIATE TOOLS TO DO SO. WE KNOW THAT A MORE HUMANE APPROACH TO SENTENCING WILL RESULT IN HEALTHIER INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES OVERALL. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE ON AB THREE THREE THREE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR WEBER MISTER COOPER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FROM YOUR DESK THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER- I RECOGNIZE I WANTED THE COLORS FOR THEIR- THEIR SPEECHES BUT EXISTING LAW ALREADY ESTABLISHES THAT TO BE CONVICTED OF A GANG ENHANCEMENT YOU MUST BE PROVED BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THE COLLECTIVITY WAS COMMITTED TO THE BENEFIT OR DIRECTOR OF A STREET GANG. AB THREE THREE THREE ADDS THE ALSO TO PROVEN ESTABLISHED HIERARCHY THAT THE ACT BENEFIT OTHER MEMBERS A GANG OF THE PERPETRATOR THIS IS NOT A SOPRANOS IS NOT SONS OF ANARCHY. IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY IT'S NOT ORGANIZED CRIMES NOT THE MAFIA STREET GANGS EVER STREET GANGS FOR OVER A DECADE IS ATTACKING THE SERGEANT IS NOT HEALTH STREET GANG FUNCTION STREET GANGS OPERATE FOR TERRITORIAL CONTROL AND POWER THROUGH VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION LOOK AT OUR SHOOTING STATEWIDE ARE VIOLENCE. IS UP BECAUSE THE STREET GANGS. I'M REGIONAL ORGANIZE CRIME TO. PER THE STREAK. IS TO PROMOTE THEIR- OVER RIVAL GANGS BY VIOLENCE AND OTHER METHODS. AB THREE THREE ALSO PROHIBITS SOME CRIMES WERE BEING INCLUDED CRIMINAL STREET GANG SYNCING ESTIMATES. IN A SPECIFIC CONCERN OF ME IS. RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL ROBBERY AND FRAUD. THESE CRIMES THE STAPLE OF THE CRIMINAL STREET GANG THEY DON'T PAY THEIR LEADERS. CRIMINAL STREET GANGS ACTIVITIES ENTERPRISES FOR SOME OF THE EXAMPLES HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THE BLUSTERING WITH IDENTIFY STREET GANG MEMBERS AND SERVE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO SEARCH WARRANTS NINETY FOUR CHARGED SIX INDIVIDUALS ARRESTED. OVER A MILLION DOLLARS RECOVERED DRUGS GUNS ASSAULT RIFLES IN THE MAGAZINES THIS IS ALL EDT FRAUD ONE STAPLE OF IT. THEY ALSO IDENTIFY PEOPLE DATES OF BIRTH SOCIAL SECURITY'S AND THEY WERE CHARGED WITH YOU BECAUSE WHEN THE PUNISHMENTS FRAUD BEVERLY HILLS FORTY FOUR PEOPLE ARRESTED FOR EASY FRAUD TOTALING TWO POINT FIVE MILLION. DIRECTLY CONNECTS THE STREET GANG MEMBERS HUNDRED TWENTY I FALLING E. D. CARDS WORTH OVER TWO POINT FIVE MILLION RUN COVERED FIREARMS IN THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CASH. LA TWELVE STREET CRIMINAL STREET GANG MEMBERS WERE INDICTED IN A RESIDENTIAL BURGLARY CONSPIRACY COVERING FOR COUNTIES THE COUNTIES WERE LA SYMPHONY WILL MATURE IN ORANGE. INDICTMENTS LINK THE DEFENDANTS TO THIRTY SEVEN RESIDENTIAL BURGLARIES CONNECT THIS CRIMINAL STREET GANGS INTERNALLY COUNTY SEVERAL STREET GANG MEMBERS ARE ARRESTED FOR A SERIES OF RESIDENTIAL BURGLARIES. RIFLES HAND GUNS LARGE QUANTITY OF AMMUNITION LARGE AMOUNT OF CASH RECOVERED FROM THE BURGLARIES SO RIGHT NOW THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED WERE PAYING FOR. CAL- YES IN CC. TO BE THE- BRING FUSION SENT. TO CALCULATE ALL THESE. THE FOCUSING ON E. D. THEFT FRAUD IN PRISONS AND JAILS ARE CONNECTED TO CONSTRUED GANGS. INCLUDING HUNDRED SEVENTY SEPARATE INVESTIGATIONS FIFTY SEVEN TOWARDS OF AS OF AUGUST OF LAST YEAR. SO A LOT GOES ON STREET GANGS ARE DIFFERENT IT IS VERY DIFFERENT AND BELIEVES OVER THE PRISON SYSTEM SO YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH THAT. BUT STREET GANGS ARE FOR COLLECTIVITY AND MOST THE MONEY TO GET. THE GOOD THROUGH BURGLARIES LOOKING FOR CASH LOOK FOR GUNS LOOK FOR JEWELRY. TO SELL. AND THAT'S THE THING WORKING STREET GANGS IS NOT LIKE ANYTHING ELSE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. IN THE BIGGER ISSUE TO BE SET ON THIS IS. I GUESS. WE DO SO MUCH FOR ADULTS WOULD BE GOOD FOR KIDS TO STOP THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE IT IS THERE IS REAL. BUT WE REVITALIZED DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO LA SACRAMENTAL. WHAT WE DON'T FAR WORSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HORRIBLE SCHOOLS. NO SUPERMARKETS NO BANKS NO SUPPORTERS- ARTS PROGRAMS FOR KIDS WE DON'T DO CRAP. THE SAME MERRY'S AND SEKHEMRE THE BEEN THAT WAY FOR YEARS THIRTY FORTY FIFTY YEARS ARE STILL THE SAME FOCUS ON THAT. BUT DON'T GIVE GAINES A BREAK. THE A LOT OF ISSUES WITH THAT AND A LOT OF SUFFERING. AND THAT'S WITH THE BIG ISSUE FOR WHAT A FIX IN TARGET BUT LIKE I SAID THE STAPLE OF THAT IS DOING. THE ROBBERIES AND BURGLARIES IN THIS CHANGES THAT AND THAT'S WHERE THE BIG THING IS COMING FROM SOMEONE NOT A POLITICIAN THAT'S THE ONE THAT DID IT FOR THIRTY YEARS. AND SPENT TN YEARS IN THE GANG UNIT. AND IT HAPPENS ON A DAILY BASIS SO WE GOT TO FIX THIS BUT- LOSING A LOSS NOT HELPING US AT ALL. SO LET'S BUILD OUR KIDS A FIX THAT FIX THAT BROKEN SYSTEM BUT I DON'T REALLY LIVE IN THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THOSE COMMUNITIES AND PUBLIC MUSIC COLOR. THAT HELL HAVE CRAP. BECAUSE NO LESS TO INVEST IT IS MORE PORTABLE ARENA SOMEWHERE. REVITALIZED DOWNTOWN INVEST IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT'S A REAL ISSUE. AND UNTIL THAT CHANGES. IS STATUS QUO BUT LIKE I SAID THE GANG ISSUE IN THE V. D. THING RIGHT NOW WE'RE ALL AWARE OF IT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ABOUT NAUSEAM. THAT'S THE BIG ISSUE DEAL WITH THAT. RIGHT NOW AMONGST OTHER THINGS BUT- EXIT WELL WELL WELL WELL INTENDED IT DEFINITELY HITS THE MARK MAX I'M SORRY IT MISSES THE MARK. THERE IS COVERAGE PARA QUE HAN IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE THREE THREE. YOU KNOW I COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO THAT WE HAVE SO MUCH WORK TO DO ON BUILDING UP COMMUNITIES OF COLOUR. PROVIDING THEM WITH THE EDUCATION THEY DESERVE WITH THE RESOURCES THEY DESERVE SO THAT CHILDREN CAN GROW UP. TO SUCCEED AND THRIVE. I DON'T KNOW THAT ANYONE ON THIS BOARD DISAGREES WITH THAT PROMISE BUT THE QUESTION IS BEFORE US TODAY AS MR GREY SO APTLY PUT IT. IS WHAT LEVEL OF DUE PROCESS IS REQUIRED WHEN WE TACK ON THESE INCREDIBLE ENHANCEMENTS. THE ROBBERIES THAT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO SPOKE ABOUT. EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO IS CONVICTED OF THOSE ROBBERIES WILL SERVE THE TIME FOR THE UNDERLYING CRIME. THIS DOES NOT CHANGE THAT WE SET THOSE. THOSE FENCES. AND THEIR SENTENCES ARE SERVED. AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT AS MANY OF YOU HAVE SEEN IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA. ON THIS BILL AND THE CHANGES THAT WILL AND IT WILL HAPPEN IF WE PUT IT INTO PLACE. IS THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY GIVEN THESE ENHANCEMENTS. AND ONCE THESE ENHANCEMENTS OR TALKED ON. WE IS A STATE DO NOT DEMAND DUE PROCESS. WE ARE INCARCERATING PEOPLE OF COLOR FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME. WITHOUT THE DUE PROCESS THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS DESERVE. THAT IS THE QUESTION BEFORE YOU TODAY COLLEAGUES. DO THESE INDIVIDUALS DESERVE DUE PROCESS. WHEN THEY ARE HAVING THESE SENTENCES PLACED ON TO THEM. AND I HOPE THAT EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU WILL ANSWER THAT IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. BECAUSE THAT IS THE LEAST IT SHOULD BE EXPECTED IN A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN BRING A LITTLE BIT MORE JUSTICE TO THAT SYSTEM TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS BURKE A HEY MISTER MURATSUCHI. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. YOU KNOW. I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT. WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING A LOT MORE ON THE ROOT CAUSES OF CRIME. AND THAT'S RIGHTFULLY SO. THAT'S WHY WE ENVISIONED IT THE DIFFICULT WORK OF GETTING MORE INVESTMENTS IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR SO THAT WE ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF CRIME. BUT I WAS STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT THE VICTIMS. ALL OF CRIMINAL GANG ACTIVITIES. THERE ARE PRIMARILY COMING FROM LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO I WENT TO OUR EVENT IN MY DISTRICT SPONSORED BY A GROUP. JUSTICE. FOR THE PARENTS IF IT JUSTICE FOR FAMILIES WITH WITH MURDER CHILDREN. LED BY A GROUP THAT TO MISTER GIBSON AND I KNOW. WOMAN NAMED LOW WANDA HAWKINS. AND I WAS STRUCK BY HOW THE VICTIMS THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS THERE WERE OVERWHELMINGLY BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE. AND SO. YOU KNOW I MEAN I KNOW THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH MASS INCARCERATION. WITH TOO MUCH OF THAT COMING AT THE EXPENSE OF BLACK AND BROWN-COMMUNITIES BUT JUST SIMPLY PENALTIES THE CRIMINAL PENALTIES. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OF MASS INCARCERATION IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO GO. THOSE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THE LONG CONTINUES A COLOR DESERVE JUST AS MUCH PROTECTIONS AS ANYONE ELSE. THAT IS WHY I'M OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. I THINK IT WAS MURATSUCHI MISTER KALRA. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS AND- YOU KNOW EIGHTY THREE THIRTY THREE THE STEP FORWARD OUT OF. BUT ADDRESS THE PROPER USE OF GETTING HAS RISEN A COUPLE JUSTICE SYSTEM BECAUSE CURRENTLY GETTING OUT HOUSES ARE OFTEN USED FOR LESLIE WILLIAMS EARLY AND DISPROPORTIONATELY AGAINST PEOPLE OF COLOR THE RESULT IN SYSTEMIC FINALIZATION OF CULTURES AND COMMUNITIES HOWEVER THIS CHANGE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S BEING TAKEN LIGHTLY. THAT ACTUALLY WAS A POLICY RECOMMENDATION PROVIDED IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE ON THE REVISION OF THE PENAL CODE THEY SPEND A LOT OF TIME AND ENERGY WITH EXPERTS SEEING WHAT ARE THE WHAT ARE THE COMPONENTS ARE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. BUT OF NOT ONLY LEAD TO MASS INCARCERATION BUT DISPROPORTIONATE INCARCERATION. SO THIS BILL DOES NOT SEEK TO MAKE THE APPLICATION AGAIN HASN'T IMPOSSIBLE RATHER REQUIRES A SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE PROVIDED IN ORDER TO PROVE THAT THE UNDERLYING OFFENSE WAS ACTUALLY. COMMITTED ON BEHALF OF THE GAME. SO THIS IS NOT LOSE LAWS IS ACTUALLY INCREASING THE DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS IN COURT. SO DON'T BELIEVE THE FEAR MONGERING WHEN IT COMES TO- NOW BURGLARS ARE INCLUDED IN FACT THE CDA THE DISK ATTORNEYS WHO OPPOSED THE BILL AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IN GENERAL THEY ACTUALLY SUPPORT REMOVING BURGLARY LOOTING VANDALISM AND SUCH. AS A SPECIFIC CRIMES THAT CAN BY THEMSELVES CREATE THE EVIDENCE NECESSARY TO SHOW THAT ONE IS A MEMBER OF A CRIMINAL STREET GANG YOU CAN STILL HAVE A GANG ENHANCEMENT ADDED. ONTO AN EDG. OF IT WILL BE A CRIME REGARDING U. D. D. OR BURGLARY OR VANDALISM BUT THOSE SURPRISED BY THEMSELVES CAN'T SHOW THAT YOU'RE PART OF A SHOULD YOU HAVE TO SHOW THE ELEMENTS WITH THE ADOPTION REQUIRE THE REQUIRED TO SHOW YOU'RE PART OF A THREE GAME AND THEN I THAT ENHANCEMENT IF THOSE TYPE OF THAT TYPE OF CONDUCT IS DONE. IN THE FURTHERANCE OF THE STREET GANG IT'S COMMON SENSE IT MAKES SENSE THAT I WAS DUE PROCESS. THAT DOESN'T ALLOW. THE REAL VAGUENESS ACROSS OCCUR. OR LONG FOR. YOU JUST SAY WITHOUT FIRST AS A MEMBER OF A GANG AND WE JUST CHARGED WITH THIS CRIME SO NOW THAT AGAIN HAS BEEN THAT ADDS A DUE PROCESS NOBODY IS OFF THE HOOK EVERYONE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND CRIMES ARE COMMITTED. PART OF AND IN FURTHERANCE OF A CRIMINAL STREET GANG. DOES DRINKING HAS IS WILL CONTINUE. TO BE APPLIED. SO PLEASE DON'T LISTEN TO THIS CONTINUAL FEAR MONGERING WHENEVER WE'RE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY IS COMMONSENSE. ORIENTED THAT ACTUALLY HAS US GIVING DUE PROCESS TO EVERYONE INVOLVED INCLUDING THE ACCUSED AND THE VICTIMS. THAT'S WHAT. AB THREE THREE THREE DOES THAT ALLOWS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO FIX SOMETHING IN FACT. WHEN GAME HAS REFERS IN ORDERS OF THAT WAS THE INTENTION WHAT HAPPENED WAS OVER THE YEARS AS TOUGH ON CRIME MASS INCARCERATION. PIPELINE WAS CREATED THEY MADE IT MORE AND MORE LOSING DEFINITION AND MORE A MORE STRINGENT IN PUNISHMENT. WORDS TO. RESET AND CORRECT THE MISTAKES HAVE BEEN MADE WELL MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN STILL ALL ALL THE TOOLS NECESSARY. TO GO AFTER CRIMINAL STREET GANGS IN OUR COMMUNITY BUT DO IN A WAY THAT ACTUALLY ATTACKS THE PROBLEM AND DOESN'T CAST A WIDE NET. THAT IS RIGHT NOW AND STIRRING FAR TOO MANY. OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER KALRA MR LOW FROM YOUR DESK YOUR RECORDS THANK YOU VERY MUCH BETTER MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES A COLLEGE WHEN I FIRST.
