MEETING OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE -- JUST DULL. WE IN APPS IN THE ABSENCE OF A QUORUM WE'RE GONNA BEGIN AS A SUBCOMMITTEE HOME WE HAVE A QUORUM WILL ESTABLISH. A QUORUM AND BEGIN TO VOTE ON THE BILLS I WANT TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE FOLLOWING BILLS BEEN PULLED FROM TODAY'S HEARING. ITEM FOR AB TWO EIGHTY ONE AND ITEM SEVEN AB. FOR NINETY THE HEARING IS TELEVISED ON CHANNEL TWENTY TWO AND CAL CHANNEL DOT COM. THE FIRST UP WE HAVE. MISTER MAYOR SU CHI. WITH. WAS AB THREE FORTY FIVE MISTER MURATSUCHI WHEN YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE COMBINATION TO BE ABLE -- TO PROCEED FIRST. I'M HERE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL THREE FOUR FIVE AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE BILL. THAT WILL PROTECT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. MOSTLY LIVING AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. FROM THE HARMFUL HEALTH EFFECTS OF OIL DRILLING NEAR HOMES SCHOOLS AND NEIGHBORHOODS. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE ANY NEW OIL DRILLING TO BE CONDUCTED AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FEET. FROM A RESIDENTS SCHOOL CHILD CARE FACILITY PLAYGROUND HOSPITAL FOR HEALTH CLINIC. BUT FIRST LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF. FOR THE THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS OF THE BILL BEFORE YOU. NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LIVE WITHIN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FEET. OF AT LEAST ONE OIL OR GAS WELL. NUMEROUS STUDIES LINCOLN PROXIMITY TO OIL AND GAS WELLS TO A HOST OF NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS. INCLUDING INCREASED RISK OF ASTHMA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES. PRETERM BIRTHS. CONGENITAL HEART DEFECTS. HIGH RISK PREGNANCIES. AN INCREASED RISK OF CANCER. OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION PRODUCES AIR TOXINS INCLUDING BONTA ORGANIC COMPOUND COMPOUNDS LIKE BENZENE AND FORMALDEHYDE. FIND AN ULTRA FINE PARTICULATE MATTER. IN HYDROGEN SULFIDE AMONG OTHERS. OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY RISKS INCLUDE WATER CONTAMINATION. TOXIC CHEMICAL SPILLS AND EXPLOSIONS. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AS A RESULT OF SENATE BILL FOR THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. ISSUED A REPORT REGARDING THE HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION. THIS STUDY RECOMMENDED A HEALTH AND SAFETY BUFFER ZONE BETWEEN SENSITIVE LAND USES. AND OIL AND GAS WELLS IN ORDER TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES WHERE NEIGHBORHOOD DRILLING A CURSE. DESPITE THIS RECOMMENDATION. AND THE ABUNDANCE OF EVIDENCE LINKING THE PROXIMITY OF OIL DRILLING. TOO SENSITIVE COMMUNITIES. CALIFORNIA LAW CURRENTLY DOES NOT PROHIBIT OIL AND GAS OPERATORS FROM PLACING WELLS. NEAR SENSITIVE AREAS LIKE SCHOOLS DAYCARES RESIDENTIAL HOMES AND HOSPITALS. THIS HEALTH PROTECTION ZONE PROPOSED IN AB THREE FOUR FIVE WILL CREATE. THE BUFFER ZONE THAT WAS RECOMMENDED BY THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL ON SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY. TO PROTECT VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AND TO HELP REDUCE THE SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY RISKS AND IMPACTS. MADAM CHAIR IF I MAY I'D LIKE TO FIRST INTRODUCE ON A BILL MARKETS. A COMMUNITY MEMBER FROM SHAFTER WHO WILL BE A HALF HER TESTIMONY TRANSLATED BY. A MISTER WONDERFUL FLORIDA'S. WHAT IS THAT THIS? WHEN I STARTED AND BECAUSE OF THE -- WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS GIVE? ON EACH SIDE TEN MINUTES AND YOU CAN DIVIDE IT UP HOWEVER YOU LIKE BUT WE WILL BE KEEPING TIME AND I'LL GIVE YOU A FEW EXTRA MINUTES FOR THE TRANSLATION. THANK YOU. WITH A SERVICE -- GIVEN GOING TO PRESENT ON THE ON THE LAKERS. ECONOMICAL COMMITTEES BUT PHYSICALLY THAT IS GETTING A COMPANION SEEN SEEN WHAT THE WELL THEY LOOK GROVE ANIMALS -- A REPRESENT THAT ANOTHER MUST IS THE PROPUESTAS DISCORDANT A SINGLE. GOOD AFTERNOON I COME FROM A CHAPTER IN THE COUNTY OF KERN TOGETHER WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS SUCH TROUBLE THIS MORNING WITH ME. OUR WORK HERE ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS. RACE IN OUR VOICES -- PORTICO OVER COMMUNITIES. ANONYMOUS BUT WHAT WHAT WE NEED A KEY WHEN IT WAS ONE OF THE IDEAS. WHAT? IN A CIRCLE WITH THE OTHERS WILL DOUBLE MUST MUST PERSONA SCHOOL GUNS. IS DONE WORK ON THOSE IN NEED OF SOME THE AND WORK AND NOT A YOU KNOW SEAT OF ANY ALLOW ONE UNITED YOU LET THE OTHER. IN ORDER COMMUNITY WE HAVE SEEN MANY CASES OF OF CANCERS INCLUDING CANCER IN CHILDREN. BECAUSE OUR QUALITY OR WATER QUALITY AND OUR SOIL ARE NOT A GOOD FOR US ANYMORE THERE'S OVER POLLUTED. BUT FIVE ORDER THAT IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS IS BOUTIQUE IS A COME OUT THIS YEAR ON SOME OF SAY THIS WOMAN WITH. IT A MILLION OP OR FAMILY SIZE TENNESSEE ON PLEASE LISTEN TO US AND HAVE CONSIDERATION FOR US WE'RE HUMAN BEINGS. IN WE ARE ASAL ARE CONTRIBUTING TO NOT ONLY OUR STATE BUT OUR COUNTRY IN WERE DYING BECAUSE OF A POOR ENVIRONMENT IN OUR COMMUNITIES. YES YES PERSONAL THINGS HERE. THANK YOU FOR ATTENTION. HI GOOD AFTERNOON -- MY NAME IS BOB NOT SHAMUS UNDER I'M AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR IN THE URBAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY DEPARTMENT. AT OCCIDENTAL COLLEGE IN LOS ANGELES AND I EXAMINE I'M HEALTH CONSEQUENCES FOR COMMUNITIES LIVING NEARBY ACTIVE OIL DEVELOPMENT. AND IN PART OF A LARGER AND I H. FUNDED STUDY IN LA. MY GOAL HERE IS TO PROVIDE YOU -- THE DIRECTION OF THE EVIDENCE ON OIL AND GAS OPERATION RELATED EXPOSURE AND HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS THIS IS A REALLY LARGE LITERATURE BUT I BROUGHT WITH ME TO RESEND SCHOLARLY REVIEW ARTICLES TO GIVE YOU AND I REALLY URGE YOU. TO LOOK AT THEM -- A SINGLE DRILL OPERATION CAN LAST FOR DECADES AND THE EXTRACTION PROCESS PRODUCES MULTIPLE EMISSIONS OF HEALTH HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANTS SUCH AS BENZENE. TALL YOU MEAN AT THE BENZENE XYLENE FORMALDEHYDE HYDROGEN SULFIDE PARTICULATE MATTER. NITROUS OXIDES AND METHYLENE CHLORIDE. TOXIC MET METALS HAVE BEEN MEASURED IN SOIL AND WATER HERE THESE OPERATIONS IN CALIFORNIA EXTRACTION AND DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS HAVE EXPANDED CLOSER. AND CLOSER TO RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES WHICH INCREASES THE OVERALL RISK OF EXPOSURE. TO AIR WATER NOISE SOIL AND LIGHT POLLUTION. MANY OF THESE COMPOUNDS ARE KNOWN TO BE TOXIC TO HUMAN HEALTH CARCINOGENIC CAUSE RESPIRATORY HARM. OR OUR ENDOCRINE DISRUPTING CHEMICALS MEETING THE ALTER THE BODY'S HORMONE SYSTEM AT VERY LOW LEVELS OF EXPOSURE WHICH CAUSES LONG TERM DEVELOPMENTAL OR REPRODUCTIVE HARM. WHICH IS A CONSIDERABLE CONSIDERATION FOR HEALTH ACROSS GENERATIONS. THERE'S A GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH TO SPEAK TO THE POINT HERE TODAY THAT LOOKS AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROXIMITY OF THESE FACILITIES AND HUMAN HEALTH. MOST OF THESE DISTANCES FURTHER AWAY THAN ARE BEING CONSIDERED TODAY. THE BASIC FINDING FROM THIS GROUP OF STUDIES IS THAT PROXIMITY MATTER IT'S LIVING CLOSER TO AN OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT SITE IS WORSE FOR YOUR HEALTH. THEN LIVING FURTHER AWAY WITH HIM TAX INCLUDING WORTH PREGNANCY AND BIRTH OUTCOMES SUCH AS LOW BIRTH WEIGHT AND SMALL FOR GESTATIONAL AGE BABIES. MIGRAINE HEADACHES FATIGUE AS MY EXACERBATIONS SINUS PROBLEMS HEADACHES SKIN PROBLEMS LOSS OF SMELL NOSE BLEEDS KIDNEY DAMAGE. THYROID PROBLEMS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS. THERE IS ALSO A HIGHER BURDEN OF CANCER MORTALITY IN COMMUNITIES NEARBY OIL EXTRACTION AND STRESS INCLUDING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STRESS. AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND JUSTICE CAN MAKE HEALTH IN CONDITIONS WORSE. THE UPSTREAM OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY ALSO HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF SEVERE INJURIES FOR WORKERS IN THE COUNTRY. THESE AREAMONG OUR COUNTRY'S MOST DANGEROUS JOBS WITH FIDELITY GREATS FOUR TO SEVEN TIMES THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. THESE WORKERS ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR BOTH DEADLY ACCIDENTS AND TOXIC EXPOSURES AND WORKERS HAVE BEEN MEASURED WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF BENZENE IN THEIR BODIES. AND A RANGE OF INJURIES BUT FURTHER SETBACKS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE A MEANINGFUL PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY APPROACH TO LIMIT HUMAN HEALTH EXPOSURE TO HARMFUL CONTAMINANTS. THERE IS MEANINGFUL PRESIDENT HERE WHEN THE OVERWHELMING SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE HAS POINTED TO THE NEED FOR POLICY ACTION. DATA ON TOBACCO LEAD AND YES A LEAN. EITHER GOOD EXAMPLES WHERE POLICYMAKERS TOOK ACTION AND IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF COUNTLESS NUMBER THE FUTURE GENERATIONS GIVEN THE EVIDENCE. THE AUTHOR THAN A GOOD GRIEF FAIR VIEW ALL RIGHT SOME PEOPLE ARE PUSHING FOR NEW STUDIES ON EXACTLY HOW EXPOSURE HAPPENS IN ORDER TO BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE THAT THESE HEALTH IMPACTS EXIST. THAT'S SOMETHING SCIENTISTS CAN POTENTIALLY TEASE OUT BUT WE ALREADY KNOW THESE HEALTH IMPACTS EXIST AND I THINK THERE'S ALREADY MORE THAN ENOUGH EVIDENCE FOR POLICY MAKERS TO TAKE ACTION. SO I URGE YOU TO LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE YOURSELF AND TAKE PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTIVE ACTION THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LORRAINE THE ABOUT AND ON BEHALF OF THE ALLIANCE OF NURSES FOR HEALTHY ENVIRONMENTS. I AM HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT AB THREE FOUR FIVE THAT WILL MANDATE A TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FOOT. HEALTH AND SAFETY BUFFER BETWEEN NEW OIL AND GAS WELLS AND SENSITIVE LAND USES WHICH INCLUDE SCHOOLS DAY CARE CENTERS HOMES AND HOSPITALS. I HAVE BEEN A REGISTERED NURSE FOR FORTY SIX YEARS THIRTY SIX OF THOSE WHO WERE AT SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL HOSPITAL IS A TRAUMA NURSE. AND DURING MY ENTIRE CAREER I WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE PEOPLE I CARED ABOUT WERE BREATHING. YOU CAN LOOK FOR THREE WEEKS WITHOUT FOOD THREE DAYS WITHOUT WATER THREE MINUTES WITHOUT AIR BUT IMAGINE THAT THAT AIR THAT YOU BREATHE THE TWENTY THREE THOUSAND TIMES EVERYDAY. IS DIRTY I AM NOW VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THE PEOPLE I CARE ABOUT OUR BRIEFING AIR POLLUTION EFFECTS CALIFORNIANS. THREE WHERE BUT IT AFFECTS SOME MORE THAN OTHERS. THERE AT OUR AS MENTIONED A HOST OF PEER REVIEWED STUDIES THAT LINK CLOSE SINCE THE OIL AND GAS WELLS. TO SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS FOR THE ELDERLY THE CHILDREN AND PREGNANT WOMEN ESPECIALLY. HYDROGEN SULFIDE IS ALL LONG IRRITANT AND AN ASTHMA TRIGGER THALIA WAYNE IS A POTENT NEUROTOXIN BENZENE IS A KNOWN HUMAN CARCINOGEN WE MUST HAVE SAFE DISTANCE BETWEEN. OPERATIONS OF OIL AND GAS AND OUR HOMES OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR HOSPITALS. JUST THINK OF THE COST OF ONE THOUSAND ONE MILLION. POINT NOT ONE POINT NINE MILLION SCHOOL DAYS LOST EVERY YEAR IN CALIFORNIA -- TO SCHOOL CHILDREN DUE TO ASTHMA ALONE. AB THREE FOUR FIVE IS BUT A SMALL STEP IN CONFRONTING A SERIOUS. SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE AIR POLLUTION. FIVE AND A HALF MILLION CALIFORNIANS MOSTLY PEOPLE OF COLOR LIVE WITHIN A MILE OF CURRENTLY OPERATING OIL AND GAS WELLS THESE PEOPLE HAVE SUFFERED FOR DECADES. WE HAVE SO MUCH TO CLEAN UP IN CALIFORNIA. TODAY I ENCOURAGE YOU TO PLEASE STOP REPEATING THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST PLACE SUPPORT A. B. THREE FOUR FIVE THANK YOU.

AND THE SAME -- GROUND RULES OF TEN MINUTES SPLIT BETWEEN YOU ALL [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] MADAME TUSSAUDS. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS SCOTT WHICH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PIPE TRADES COUNCIL. THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES. WESTERN STATES COUNCIL SHEET METAL WORKERS. IN THE ELEVATOR CONSTRUCTORS UNION. I'M HERE BECAUSE THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT OF AN ISSUE TO NOT. HAVE THE INTEGRITY OF THE FAX BORN BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. THE BILL AS WRITTEN. AND AS PRESENTED BY THE AUTHOR. IS ON WARRANTED. IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE. AND IT'S FRANKLY RECKLESS. THE ANALYSIS PREPARED FOR THIS BILL WHICH I THINK WAS QUITE THOROUGH. FAILED TO CITE. A SINGLE STUDY SUPPORTING. THE BILL AS PRESENTED BY THE ASSEMBLYMEMBER. IT CITED TWO STUDIES. ONE STUDY WAS CITED BY THE AUTHOR. WHICH HE SPOKE ABOUT EXTENSIVELY. IF YOU LOOK AT THE NOTATIONS IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. YOU'LL SEE THAT THE C. C. S. T. STUDY THAT WAS REFERENCED. WAS ISSUED WAS IT A REPORT THAT WAS ISSUED RELATIVE TO HYDRAULIC FRACKING. THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL ADDRESSES IT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING. THE SECOND STUDY REFERENCED IN THIS ANALYSIS AND THE ONLY OTHER STUDY REFERENCED. IS THE BORDER THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD STUDY OF NEIGHBORHOOD AIR NEAR PETROLEUM SOURCES OR SNAPS. THE ANALYSIS CORRECTLY. SITES. THAT THERE IS NO DATA AVAILABLE FROM THE SNAP STUDY. SO YOU HAVE TO STUDIES. NO CONCLUSIONS RELATIVE TO THIS BILL. IN MY THIRTY TWO YEARS AROUND HERE BEFORE YOU PUT AN ENTIRE INDUSTRY OUT OF BUSINESS. INCLUDING TENS AND THOUSANDS OF MINE MEMBERS. YOU SHOULD AT LEAST TAKE THE TIME AND CARE. TO BASE IT ON SCIENTIFIC FACTS. MADAM CHAIR THAT IS SIMPLY NOT EVIDENT HERE TODAY [inaudible] IN ADDITION. THE DEFINITION OF EXISTING WELLS. IN THIS BILL. IS SOBRE NINE SO BROAD. IN SO EXTENSIVE IT WILL VIRTUALLY APPLY TO THE VAST MAJORITY OF EXISTING WELLS IN CALIFORNIA [inaudible] AGAIN EXASPERATING THE THE IMPACT ON MY MEMBERS JOBS. WHAT PEOPLE FAIL TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT IN THESE EXISTING WELLS? THEY WENT THROUGH A LOCAL APPROVAL PROCESS. WITH LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. THEN COLLUDED. LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS. TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION. THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF THOSE PROJECTS AND WHERE THEY WERE CITED. TO NOW COME FORWARD. WITH A PIECE OF LEGISLATION. TO CLOSE DOWN IN INDUSTRY IN ONE FELL SWOOP [inaudible] WITHOUT ANSWERING. THESE SERIOUS SERIOUS FLAWS IN THE BILL. DOES IT HUGE DISSERVICE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT HAS. IT HAS. IT UNINTENDED OR PERHAPS INTENDED CONSEQUENCES. IN THAT THE DEFINITION WOLF WHAT IT WILL AFFECT FLOW LINES. AND WAIST LINES WHICH COULD CREATE A PERVERSE INCENTIVE FOR WELL OWNERS TO NOT DO THE TYPE OF WORK THEY NEED TO IMPROVE. AIR EMISSIONS FOR FEAR OF BEING CLOSE BY BEING FLAG AS A NEW OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION UNIT. THIS BILL IS NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME MEMBERS. I WOULD URGE YOU TO REJECT THIS BILL TODAY. AND SEND IT BACK UNTIL THERE IS THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF SCIENCE AND WORK DONE -- BEFORE PASSING OUT. SO WITH THAT MY CLIENTS WOULD URGE A NO VOTE. MANAGER MEMBERS HEALING GARCIA FOR THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION. REPRESENTING THE STATE'S MAJOR PRODUCERS OF OIL AND REFINERS OF TRANSPORTATION FUELS. THAT ARE VITAL TO OUR ECONOMY. AND VERY MUCH NECESSARY FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS TO DRIVE TO WORK AND TO HOME. IN ON VACATION THIS SUMMER. LET ME JUST ADD A POINT TO MR WATCHES A POINT BECAUSE HE'S ACTUALLY RIGHT. IF WE WERE IN A COURT OF LAW. I WOULD HAVE TO OBJECT -- BECAUSE WE'RE ASSUMING FACTS NOT IN EVIDENCE. WE MAKE A STATEMENT HERE A VERY DIRECT STATEMENT. ABOUT THE AFFECT OF OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION IN TERMS OF ITS IMPACTS -- TO COMMUNITIES. AS IF IT'S FACTUAL WHEN IN FACT IT IS NOT. WHAT I SPENT MY A A SPRING BREAK DOING IN -- TO NOT EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED BUT I READ REPORTS I READ THE OIL CHANGE INTERNATIONAL REPORT WHICH IS THE BASIS FOR THIS BILL. CALLS FOR THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FOOT BUFFER. A SEARCH THE SAME -- FALSE STATEMENTS BUT ACTUALLY DID SOMETHING I READ THE REPORT AND I READ THE FOOTNOTES BUT I WAS TAUGHT TO DO THAT IN LAW SCHOOL. I READ THE FOOTNOTES AND THAT LED ME TO THE CCSD REPORT PAGE CITED. THE SPECIFIC PAGE CITED BY THE OIL CHANGE INTERNATIONAL REPORT. SPECIFICALLY TELLS YOU THAT THE FINDINGS DO NOT APPLY TO CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA IMPACTS MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BUT HAVE NOT BEEN MEASURE. SO WE ARE MAKING STATEMENTS AS THE AS IF THEY ARE FACT WE ARE PROPOSING TO SHUT DOWN. THOUSANDS OF WELLS IN CALIFORNIA OF THE PRODUCTION LOS ANGELES POTENTIALLY ENDANGERING THE JOBS OF THOUSANDS OF FOLKS THAT MISTER WHAT SPOKE. TO HARMING COMMUNITIES AND WE'RE ALL DOING IT ALL ON A FALSE ASSUMPTION THAT THERE A FAX OR IN. SO I SAID WELL IT'S NOT THE CCS T. REPORT BECAUSE THAT CLEARLY DOESN'T SAY THAT THERE ARE -- NOTED -- IMPACTS SO MAYBE IT'S THE LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. MAYBE THAT ONE SAYS THAT SO I READ THAT REPORT [inaudible] THAT REPORT. CLEARLY CONCLUDES. THAT THE LITERATURE IS UNABLE TO CONCLUDE AT THIS TIME WHETHER OR NOT LIVING WORKING OR GOING TO SCHOOL IN THE OIL AND GAS FACILITIES. IS ASSOCIATED WITH A LONG TERM NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS. THAT'S THE LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH REPORT ISSUED IN FEBRUARY. TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH VERY CLEARLY CONCLUDES THE EXACT OPPOSITE. OF WHAT THIS STATUTE. PROPOSES TO STATE AS FACT. AGAIN JOBS ARE AT RISK OIL. OIL SUPPLY FOR THE STATE TRANSPORTATION FUELS ARE AT RISK. AND WE'RE BASING IT ON FALSE ASSUMPTIONS. MISTER WHICH MENTIONED THE SNAPS ANALYSIS THAT. THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD CONDUCTING TODAY. THEY'RE CONDUCTING THAT ANALYSIS REVIEWING. THE IMPACTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION IN NEIGHBORING FACILITIES THAT CAME AS A RESULT OF AB SIX SEVENTEEN MISS GARCIA'S BILL. THAT BILL IS SUPPOSED TO GIVE US DATA. DATA WHICH WE CAN RELY ON TO IMPLEMENT POLICY DATA DRIVEN POLICY AND FOR THAT REASON OUR INDUSTRY. A SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE WE WANT TO DEVELOP POLICY BASED ON DATA. WHAT AB THREE FORTY FIVE NOW DOES IT SAYS LET'S FORGET THE DATA? LET'S FORGET THE ANALYSIS LET'S JUST PRESUME THE FAX. AND THAT'S SIMPLY SOMETHING THAT WE CANNOT ACCEPT. BECAUSE JOBS ARE AT RISK FUEL SUPPLIES AT RISK OUR ECONOMY AND THE SPECIFICALLY. COMMUNITIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY ARE AT RISK SO WE JUST CAN'T ACCEPT THAT AS FACT. WHAT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ALSO POINTS OUT IN ALL MAKE THIS MY LAST POINT? WAS THAT THERE WERE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED. IN LOS ANGELES AND AN APPROPRIATELY SO ECAUSE THEY WERE SMALL OPERATORS. THAT WERE WORKING OPERATING BELOW THE STANDARD OF CARE OPERATING EQUIPMENT THAT WAS IN DISREPAIR. THAT IS A SPECIFIC SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES. THAT WE ARE HAPPY TO ADDRESS WE ARE HAPPY. TO JOIN THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN THIS BODY AND WORKING ON THAT ISSUE BECAUSE WE CANNOT ACCEPT. AND WE WON'T ACCEPT AND SUPPORT SOMEBODY OPERATING BELOW THE STANDARD OF CARE. BUT THAT IS A VERY VERY DIFFERENCES SITUATION THAT WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IN AB. THREE FORTY FIVE YOU HAVE A STATE WIDE. HALF MILE SET BACK REGARDLESS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES REGARDLESS OF THE SITE REGARDLESS OF THE WORK THAT WAS DONE LOCALLY TO ENSURE THE PROTECTION THAT COMMUNITY. AND THAT IS GOING TO HARM JOBS. IN IS A BROAD BLANKET APPROACH TO TO SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK WE CAN'T ACCEPT AND WE WON'T. AND FOR THOSE REASONS THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BUT I WOULD VERY VERY MUCH ADAMANTLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT THE SPECIFIC STUDIES THAT. ASK FOR INFORMATION BECAUSE IT'S SIMPLY NOT THERE. FOR THAT REASON THE THE WEST IS A FUN POSITION OPPOSE THE BILL. MANAGER MEMBERS AS READY AS A BEHALF OF STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL ALL BE -- BRIEF BECAUSE I KNOW IN SPIRIT OF TIME WE'VE ALREADY COVERED MANY ISSUES -- BUT IN SHORT CALIFORNIA MUST DO A BETTER JOB OF BALANCING THE PRIORITIES ON THE ENVIRONMENT WITH ALSO THE ISSUES THAT ARE AFFECTING WORKING FAMILIES TODAY. YOU'RE WELCOME MILLER WITH THE INCOME INEQUALITY THAT EXIST. CALIFORNIA'S GREATNESS WAS CREATED BY THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR. GOOD QUALITY UNION JOBS THAT ARE NO LONGER IN EXISTENCE AS WE'RE LOOKING TO ADDRESS ISSUES WITH THE ENVIRONMENT AND THEY JUST TRANSITION IT SHOULDN'T BE TO ELIMINATE ALL THESE GOOD QUALITY JOBS ARE ACTUALLY EMPLOYING MANY UNION MEMBERS. AND ARE PROVIDING FOR FAMILY SUSTAINING WAGES WITH ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTHCARE. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WANTS TO THE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BUT AS WAS STATED BY THE GERMAN FROM WEST BUT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO ADDRESS IT. AND IF HE WOULD A REACHED OUT EARLIER AND ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER CONVERSATION TO LOOK AT HOW TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF CONCERN WHEN THERE'S LESS THAN STANDARD. OPERATIONS OF THOSE WELLS BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS BILL INTENDS TO DO. THIS BILL IS MORE OF AN EMOTIONAL ARGUMENT TO BASICALLY GET RID OF AN INDUSTRY THAT CURRENTLY PROVIDES. REASONABLE COST ENERGY FOR A LOT OF WORKING FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE AND THAT IS ACTUALLY EMPLOYING THOUSANDS OF UNION MEMBERS WITH ACCESS TO APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. THANK YOU PROVIDING WORKING FAMILIES IN THE MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WITH A CAREER NOT JUST A JOB BUT AN ACTUAL CAREER. THOSE ARE THE BLUE COLLAR JOBS THAT CALIFORNIA IS NOW HEMORRHAGING TO OTHER STATES. WE SUPPORTED A LOT OF THE STRONG ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS THAT THE STATE HAS ALREADY PASSED WE WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN IT IN THEIR PASSAGE. BUT HOWEVER WE NEVER MEANT FOR THEM -- TO RADIC KATE ALL THESE INDUSTRIES WE WENT TO ACTUALLY MAKE THIS INDUSTRY SAFER. MORE EFFICIENT. IN ACTUALLY CREATE THOSE JOBS IN CALIFORNIA FOR A LOT OF THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. SO BECAUSE OF ALL THOSE REASONS AND BECAUSE OF CALIFORNIA'S STRONGEST ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS TO ADDRESS A LOT OF THESE PERMITTED. WE HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO REJECT THIS BILL SENATE BACK AND ALLOW US TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON A DIFFERENT FORM THANK YOU. YOU KNOW NOW I WOULD LIKE TO ASK MEMBERS THE PUBLIC TO PLEASE COME FORWARD TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IT AGAIN WE ARE NOT ACCEPTING TESTIMONY JUST YOUR NAME. ANY AFFILIATION YOU WANT TO GIVE. AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU SUPPORT THE BILL. ON A DAY ON BEHALF OF THE AM VETS AMERICAN VETERANS DEPARTMENT A CALIFORNIA WERE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL.

THREE FORTY FIVE THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLC WISHING TO VOICE THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. OKAY I SEE NINE AND BEFORE I MOVED TO THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS LIKE TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM. WE'LL CALL PLEASE. MEMBERS FRIEDMAN HERE FRIEDMAN HERE FLORA FLOOR HERE CHAU. EGGMAN GARCIA. GARCIA HERE LIMON. MATHIS. MATHIS HERE MCCARTY. MCCARTY HERE MELENDEZ WROTE TO TREAT THEIR WROTE TO G. HERE STONE. OKAY WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A QUORUM -- BEFORE I GO TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS ARE YOU ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS YES TO THE BILL OKAY. WITHOUT ALL GO TO MISTER FLORA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THIS RESEARCH YOU'RE JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU HERE AND AND MAYBE A FEW COMMENTS AT THE END BUT DO YOU AGREE WITH THE ANALYSIS IN THE BILL'S SUPPORTERS. THAT IF THIS BILL PASSES THE RESULT IN STUDY NOW SIGNIFICANT IN STATE PRODUCTION. I DISAGREE. HI OF YOU KNOW THERE THERE WAS REFERENCE MADE TO WHAT THE PEOPLE LEARN IN LAW SCHOOL FIRST THING I LEARNED A LAW SCHOOLS READ THE BILL. THE BILL SAYS THAT THIS ONLY APPLIES TO ALL NEW OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT. SO WITH HIS BILL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT AND THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN. WE CAN DISCUSS THAT -- LOOK AT A LATER TIME BECAUSE I DO HAVE. CONCERNS THAT THIS IS GOING TO LIMIT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF IN STATE WILL PRODUCTION -- MOVING FORWARD IN THE FUTURE A AND EQUALLY OUT FOR FOLKS THAT HAVE PROPERTY RIGHTS WHERE THEY HAVE THE MIDDLE RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE GROUND THAT WILL ALSO BE A HUGE CONCERN SO NOW WE'RE DEALING WITH THE PRIVATE PROPERTY ISSUE. BUT DOES THIS THING PROGRESSES. IT IS FASCINATING THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE DO IN THE STATE WE TALK ABOUT THE LOAN COMMUNICATE WITH LOW INCOME COMMUNITY AND ALL THAT WE NEED TO DO TO SUPPORT AND PROTECT THEM. ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT THAT DRIVES UP THE COST AND THE COST OF LIVING IN THE STATE IS QUITE FRANKLY FOOD THE COST OF FOOD THE COST OF TRANSPORTATION. SO IF THERE IS ANY ASPECT OF THIS BILL THAT LIMITS IN STATE OIL PRODUCTION. AND DRIVES UP THE COST WILL BE TRANSPORTATION OR THE COST TO FARM THE COST. TO TO PUT A PRODUCT IN THE SUPERMARKET THAT OUR OUR COLLEAGUES AND OUR FRIENDS GO BY WE HAVE A SERIOUS ISSUE. AND SO ANYTHING THAT WE DO ON THAT -- I AM CONCERNED AS WELL AS ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE OF IT IF WE SHUT DOWN THE IN STATE OIL PRODUCTION WHERE WE GONNA SUPPLEMENT THAT FROM. IT'S GONNA BE FROM OVER SORT OF FOREIGN OIL. WE HAVE THE ABILITY IN CALIFORNIA THE MOST REGULATED OIL INDUSTRY ANY ATTIRE COUNTRY. THAT'S THE SAFEST PLACE THAT WE CAN GET THIS OIL IS RIGHT HERE BELOW US IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGES TAKE THIS IN MIND WE TALK ABOUT THE LOW INCOME COMMUNITY BUT LET'S REALLY FOCUS ON WHAT. THE ASPECT AND WHAT THIS ACTUALLY MEANS BECAUSE IF WE DO NOW I PERSONALLY BELIEVE IT'S GONNA SHUT DOWN ABOUT 12% OF THE PRODUCTION. AT THE NUMBER THAT I'VE SEEN -- IT'S NUMBER THAT I BELIEVE IN. AND IF THAT IS THE CASE. WE'RE GONNA SEE A SIGNIFICANT COST OF LIVING INCREASE THAT IS GOING TO HURT THE LOW INCOME FOLKS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND I STRONGLY -- ENCOURAGES TO TAKE A SECOND LOOK AT THIS BILL AND FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL NOT BE ABLE SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IT MIGHT MAYOR BRIEFLY RESPOND SURE. YES SIR THANK YOU MISTER FLOOR FOR YOUR YOUR COMMENTS AND YOUR CONCERNS AND I SHARE. YOUR DESIRE NOT TO SHUT DOWN THE INDUSTRY. I SUPPORT GOOD UNION JOBS. BUT I THINK. ANY KIND OF OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT. SHOULD NOT COME AT THE EXPENSE OF THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT. ARE ONLY TRYING TO PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE OF CALIFORNIANS BY BY HAVING A MINIMUM SET BACK JUST TO GIVE YOU A CLEAR. YOU KNOW -- IDEA OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE THERE ARE OTHER COMMUNITIES INCLUDING OUR FAVORITE STATE OF TEXAS. THE CITY OF DALLAS HAS A FIFTEEN HUNDRED FOOT. OIL DRILLING SET BACKFROM THE SENSITIVE POPULATIONS THAT WERE TRYING TO PROTECT. HOUSING SCHOOLS FAITH INSTITUTIONS. THIS IS NOT A RADICAL IDEA WE'RE JUST TRYING TO PROTECT. CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. DOES THAT NEED MEDICAL CARE. MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. SO I'M NOT TRYING TO SHUT DOWN THIS INDUSTRY I'VE NEVER TALKED ABOUT SHUTTING DOWN THIS INDUSTRY AND I'VE ALWAYS I HAVE A STRONG RECORD. THE SUPPORTING GOOD UNION JOBS. BUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF OIL AND GAS SHOULD NOT COME AT THE EXPENSE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND THAT IS WHAT I'M PROPOSING HERE A MINIMUM SET BACK. TO PROTECT VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WITH QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY -- ZOOM MISTER MAYOR SU CHI -- I DO APPRECIATE YOUR ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ASK YOUR COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE WORKING ON LANGUAGE THAT DEALS WITH VARIANCES AND POSSIBLY ALSO WITH WHAT IS CONSIDERED TO BE A NEW WELL BECAUSE I THINK THAT ONE OF THE POINTS OF THE CAN. OF CONTENTION IS. ON WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT IS NEW -- OPERATIONS AND WHAT ISN'T BUT ALSO YOU KNOW THE THE IDEA THAT IF A WELL CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT IT CAN OPERATE -- SAFELY AND WITHOUT TREMENDOUS AIR QUALITY ISSUES BECAUSE THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF WELLS IS THIS FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF OIL THERE'S DIFFERENT APPS. THAT THERE BE A ROBUST VARIANCE -- PROCEDURE THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY FOLLOW DO YOU ARE WHAT YOU WOULD YOU WOULD YOU AGREE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT LANGUAGE OF COURSE. OKAY THANK YOU AND I DO APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING THIS FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A CONVERSATION. ABOUT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE WELL IT WILL ACTIVITIES AND WE'RE NOT -- GIVEN THE AMOUNT AND EVEN THE GROWTH OF OIL EXPLORATION IN URBAN AREAS AND COMMUNITIES ARE RIGHTFULLY CONCERNED SO I DO APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I CONNECTS I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY. THANK THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES THANK YOU I APPRECIATE TO EVERYONE'S PATIENCE I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE. YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL THAT -- THE OPPOSING WITNESSES INDICATED THAT WE WERE. PROCEEDING WITH THIS BILL RECKLESSLY WALLOW IN FACT. YOU KNOW I ASKED MY STAFF TO PRINT OUT. THE SAME COPY THAT -- THE REPRESENTED FROM THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION REFERENCE THE FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT. FROM THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND IN THEIR CONCLUSION THEY RECOMMEND THAT LOS ANGELES COUNTY EXPANDING THE MINIMAL SET BACK. DISTANCE THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS BEYOND THREE HUNDRED FEET BECAUSE OF SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE INDICATING THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY IMPLICATIONS. AGAIN I WOULD EMPHASIZE ALSO THAT WE ARE BEHIND THE CITY OF TO RELEASE SOME COMMUNITIES IN THE CITY OF TEXAS IN TERMS OF HAVING A MINIMUM SET BACK. TO PROTECT CHILDREN [inaudible] SENIORS FAMILIES. WHERE OIL DRILLING IS CURRENTLY TAKING PLACE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE BACKYARDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS NEAR SCHOOLS? NEAR PLAYGROUNDS NEAR HEALTHCARE FACILITIES. I BELIEVE THIS IS A COMMON SENSE PROPOSAL. AND I ASK. THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. TO ENGAGE IN THIS CONVERSATION THAT. AS WE PROCEED. TOWARD OUR ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE NEED TO BE ABLE. TO HAVE SOME COMMON SENSE CONVERSATIONS AS TO ALLOWING THE INDUSTRY TO GO FORWARD BUT WOULD NOT AT THE EXPENSE.

SURE THAT -- THE ONE OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT IS IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN NEW ACTION PLAN WAS APPROVED BY THE GOVERNING BOARD OF THE SANTA MONICA BAY RESTORATION COMMISSION. WHICH REALIGNED SOME OF OUR PRIORITIES WE HAVE ONLY FORTY FOUR ACTIONS -- TO TRY TO COMPLETE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF THE BAY THE BENEFITS -- TO THE RESIDENTS OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND TO THE WILDLIFE AND THOSE NEW -- GOALS MORE DUE TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN -- WITH THE GOALS IN THE STRATEGIC PLAN OF THE STATE BECAUSE THE CONSERVANCY SO IT'S A VERY TIMELY ISSUE FOR US -- I NEED TO THANK THE STATE. WATER BOARD FOR ALL OF ITS SUPPORT OVER MANY MANY YEARS THE WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE'VE LABORED -- FOR ARE STARTING TO PAY OFF FOR SIDE TO SEE THOSE VALUES AND IT'S NOW TIME FOR US TO MOVE ON TO INCREASE -- VISITOR SHIPPED TO THE COAST LINE TO INCREASE PROTECTION AND RESTORATION OF THE COASTLINE AND TO GET OURSELVES READY -- WITH CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND ADAPTATION PLANNING ALL OF WHICH WE FIND TO FIND A GREAT DEAL OF TALENT AND SUPPORT WITHIN STATE BECAUSE CONSERVANCY. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO VOICE HER SUPPORT FOR THE BILL PLEASE COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE. OKAY IS THERE ANYBODY OPPOSED TO THE BILL WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK OKAY YOU CAN COME OVER TO THE TABLE IN TWO MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS A MULTILATERAL REPRESENTED BY WHAT LET'S LAND TRUST. WE WOULD EAGERLY SUPPORT -- NEW LEGISLATION FOR THE SANTA MONICA RESTORATION COMMISSION. IT WAS BASED ON THE MORE CONFERENCE A ROADMAP THAT WE WERE PROMISED TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO -- WHAT WE THAT WE STILL DON'T HAVE I? DISAGREE WITH THE NOTION THAT THIS DOESN'T ALTER THE PUBLIC PROCESS ON THE COMMENTS OF MISTER FOR JUST MADE HE'S NEVER ACTUALLY. MADE PUBLICLY TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION -- ORGANIZATIONS A MEMBER OF THE WATERSHED ADVISORY COUNCIL WE'VE NEVER. IN IN THE SIX YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN REGULARLY ATTENDING MEETINGS. I'M NOT HEARD A SINGLE COMMENT -- OF CONCERN ABOUT CONTINUE WITH THE WATER BOARD THE NEW ACTION PLAN DOES NOT. SIGNIFICANTLY REALIGN THE COMMISSION. I THINK THERE ARE MANY ISSUES -- I THINK SURE THEIR ADVANTAGES TO RE HOUSING IT WITH THE CONSERVANCY THEY'RE ALSO DISADVANTAGED. EXCUSE ME DISADVANTAGES THE WATER BOARD HAS A REGIONAL STRUCTURE THAT HAS A LOCAL. A REGIONAL WATER BOARD -- THAT WE CAN GO TO MEETINGS EVERY MONTH THEY'VE GOT OFFICES THERE I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE THE CONSERVANCY. AND WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THE POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF ALL THE OPTIONS ON THE TABLE WHICH IS WHAT THE PUBLIC PROCESS WAS SUPPOSED TO DO. RATHER THAN HAVING HEARD IT DOWN TO ONLY THE PERCEIVED ADVANTAGES OF ONE OPTION. SO IN AN IDEAL SITUATION I'D ASK YOU TO TO PUT THIS ON ON HOLD FOR AWHILE IT SEEMS PREMATURE TO GET THE ROADMAP. ARM MORE REALISTICALLY GIVEN THE TIME OF THE DAY -- WHAT I WOULD ASK IS A COMMITMENT FROM THE MEMBER? TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS NOT JUST THE BAY FOUNDATION BUT ALL STAKEHOLDERS. TO FINISH THIS PUBLIC PROCESS AND I KNOW THAT WHEN THE COMMISSION WAS CREATED WAS A TWO STEP PROCESS SB. FIFTY SEVEN SIMPLY ASK FOR MORE INFORMATION. AND THAT WAS GIVEN IN A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THEN THAT BECAME SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY ONE WHICH CREATED. THE ARE SIMILAR TO BE RESTORATION COMMISSION I WOULD HAVE TIME TO GO INTO MORE DETAILS BUT THERE'S THERE'S A LOT TO TALK ABOUT THERE'S DIDN'T THE NOMINATION PAPERS NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH EXPLAINED WHY THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. WAS SELECTED AS THE HOSTING AGENCY. BEFORE WE GO TINKERING WITH THIS WE REALLY OUGHT TO HAVE. STE PUBLIC DISCUSSION. AND AGAIN THEY JUST HAD A SURVEY YOU CAN WRAP UP I WILL. LITERALLY JUST FILLED OUT A SURVEY WITH FORTY RESPONDENTS NOT A SINGLE RESPONSE RAISE THIS ISSUE IT'S JUST IT'S NEVER EVER BEEN RAISED IN A SINGLE MEETING. WE FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS BY HAPPENSTANCE IT'S IT'S JUST WASN'T COMMUNICATED SO I WHAT I WOULD ASK DISAPPOINTED AS A COMMITMENT FROM THEM TO BE AUTHOR.

AT ALL INCOME LEVELS SPECIFICALLY THE BILL INCREASES REBATE LEVELS BY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS. AND LIMIT ELIGIBILITY FOR HIGH INCOME INDIVIDUALS. THESE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE CV RPG WERE ORIGINALLY PROPOSED MY BILL AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY FOUR ERROL SMEDLEY ADOPTED TO THE BUDGET PROCESS IN. TWENTY FIFTEEN WITH A ONE YEAR SUNSET.

AND MORE EQUITABLE -- WE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS IN CALIFORNIA ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE SELLING MUCH MORE THAN EVER. BUT THE DOWNSIDE OF THAT IS THERE'S LESS REBATE MONEY TO GO AROUND SO WE NEED TO FOCUS THOSE REBATES IN THE PLACES WHERE THE MAKE THE MOST DIFFERENCE AND AS MISTER COOPER HAS SAID. THAT HE IS WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE LESS AFFLUENT. AND SO BY HAVING THE INCOME CAP WE RESERVE THOSE REBATES FOR THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM THEY WILL MAKE THE MOST DIFFERENCE. AND THAT WAY WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE ELECTRIC FIELD VEHICLE MARKET AND DO IT IN THE MOST EQUITABLE MANNER SO WE'RE SUPPORT. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO VOICE THEIR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL -- PLEASE COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE. CAN THE SERGEANTS PLEASE WITH THE MICROPHONE UP FOR THE PUBLIC. THANK YOU.

AB FIFTEEN EIGHTY THREE WERE TO STEPS TO CALIFORNIA RECYCLING MARKET DEVELOPMENT ACT WHICH SEEKS TO BALANCE CALIFORNIA'S AMBITIOUS ORGANIC WASTE DIVERSION GOALS. WITH THE CHANGING MARKET REALITIES ARE STATES TWENTY TWENTY FIVE ORGANIC WASTE DIVERSION GOAL OF 75% IS RAPIDLY APPROACHING MEANWHILE AFTER IMPLEMENTING ITS NATIONAL SORT POLICY WAS STRICT CONTAMINATION LEVEL CAPS. CHINA AS WE KNOW IS NOW REFUSING TO ACCEPT MOST OF OUR RECYCLED MATERIAL THE RESULT OF THIS MUCH IS WHAT WE LIKE TO CALL RECYCLE MATERIAL IS NOW SITTING IN A LANDFILL -- ALSO CAUSING PROBLEMS I CAN TELL YOU MEMBERS BEFORE I CAME DOWN UP 2%. THERE IS A THREE ALARM FIRE AT THE PORT OF STOCKTON AT A RECYCLING CENTER THAT IS OVER PILED WITH PLASTICS AND PAPER -- AND OTHER KINDS OF WASTE THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF THING THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS AS WE'RE GOING FORWARD. WE KNOW THAT'S A PROBLEM NOW THERE'S NO MARKET AND SO IT IS BEING STOCKPILE THINGS THAT WE THOUGHT WERE RECYCLE ARE NOW SITTING AROUND. AND CATCHING ON FIRE -- IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT FIXING THE PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO START ADDRESSING RECYCLE RECYCLING COMPREHENSIVELY. IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO RESPOND TO THE CONTAMINATION LEVELS OF OUR RECYCLED EXPORTS WE HAVE TO LOOK BACK EVEN FURTHER. AB FIFTEEN EIGHT THREE SIX TO DO THAT. BY LOOKING AT NEARLY EVERY ASPECT OF RECYCLING FROM PUBLIC EDUCATION AND CURBSIDE RECYCLING PROGRAMS TO MARKET DEVELOPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY INCENTIVES WITH ME TODAY I HAVE. NICK LAPIS WITH A CALIFORNIA AGAINST WASTE MARK PRAYER ON BEHALF OF REPUBLIC SERVICES AND JOHN KENNEDY WAS RULE COUNTY REPRESENT AS OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU TWO MINUTES A PIECE PLEASE. CAPTION IN A CLASS OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. WE'VE HAD A REALLY SUCCESSFUL -- RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPING CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS BUT A LOT OF THAT HAS RELIED ON SENDING RECYCLES OVERSEAS. NOW THAT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS SAID THAT THEY NO LONGER WANT MANY OF OUR CYCLES. AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE FOLLOWING SUIT. IT'S ON ONE HAND A SORT OF EXISTENTIAL RISK FOR THE RECYCLING INDUSTRY BECAUSE SO MUCH -- WE RECYCLED NO LONGER AS MARKETS BUT THE SAME TIME IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY. AND THIS BILL REINVESTED RECYCLING IN CALIFORNIA -- AND KEEPS EXPANDING RECYCLING TO INCLUDE COPPER. COMPOSTING ORGANICS AS WELL THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKUP PRAYER ON BEHALF OF REPUBLIC SERVICES. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND FOR HER LEADERSHIP. IN THIS AREA I ALSO WANT TO NOTE FOR THE COMMITTEE THAT YOU HAVE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE SOLID WASTE INDUSTRY THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE. TO MY KNOWLEDGE THERE IS NO OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE AND I THINK THAT THE FACT THAT THESE THREE SECTORS. WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HANDLING SOLID WASTE AND PROMOTING SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING POLICY ARE ALL HERE UNIFIED IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE? I CANNOT I CANNOT. OVER STATE THE NEED FOR THIS BILL TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF CHINA SOARED WE DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE CAPACITY IN THE CALIFORNIA. FOR PURPOSES OF NOT ONLY PROCESSING SOLID WASTE BUT FINDING A HOME FOR RECYCLED MATERIAL ONCE IT HAS BEEN PROCESSED WE THEREFORE ASK AND JR AYE VOTE. HELLO JOHN KENNEDY WITH RC RC. WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND WE SEE IT AS A VITAL TOOL TO HELP US COMPLY WORK TO ADDRESS NATIONAL SORT AND COMPLY WITH SB -- THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE WE PASSED A COUPLE YEARS AGO -- THE REQUIRES THE STATE TO DIVERT 75% ORGANIC WASTE FROM LANDFILLS BY -- TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE'RE HAVING A REALLY HARD TIME DOING THAT AND CAL RECYCLE SAYS THAT COULD COST UP TO TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS. EVEN AFTER SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS AND PUT -- PROPOSED BENEFITS THAT COULD STILL BE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR SO IN ADDITION TO THESE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS REALLY HELPING TO CHEN UP AND IN STATE RECYCLING PROGRAM. TO DEAL WITH NATIONAL SOARED WE THINK THE ORGANIC WASTE INCENTIVE PROGRAM WILL ALSO GO A LONG WAY TO HELPING US MEET OUR THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE REQUIREMENTS. SO WE'RE STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BOOK FOR TWO OTHER WAYS TO HELP -- THESE RECYCLING FACILITIES PENCIL OUT AND CREATE MORE JOBS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S REALLY A WIN TO ADDRESS NATIONAL SOARED A WIN TO ADDRESS -- HELP LOCALS ADDRESS ORGANIC WASTE RECYCLING AND BRING JOBS TO THE STATE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH URGE YOUR AYE VOTE AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO CONVEY -- SEE SACKS SUPPORT FOR THE BILL AS WELL.

FIFTY SIX BEFORE I BEGIN I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- THAT REMOVES THE ANY OTHER DUTIES AS THE FIND FUNCTION OF THE AUTHORITY AND MAKE THE OTHER TECHNICAL CHANGES IN FACT ON BEHALF OF THE AUTHOR WE WILL COMMIT TO FURTHER AMENDMENTS THAT WILL -- CLARIFY THE PC PRESIDENT WILL RECUSANT THEMSELVES FROM ANY AUTHORITY DECISIONS REGARDING PROCUREMENT AND ADDRESS THE APPROPRIATE RECOVERY OF AUTHORITY ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. AB FIFTY SIX WILL ADDRESS THE FACT THAT NO ONE DISAGREES WITH THE NATURE OF ENERGY PROCUREMENT IN CALIFORNIA HAS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED. CURRENTLY IN THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH OUR GREAT FOR ANY REASON THE STATE IS LEFT WITH LITTLE RECOURSE OUR OPTIONS TO ALLOWED US TO ACT QUICKLY. AB FIFTY SIX GIVES THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THE AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY IN ADVANCE TRANSPORTATION FINANCING AUTHORITY TO PROCURE POWER. TO MEET THE STATE'S CLIMATE CLEAN ENERGY AND RELIABILITY GOALS. THIS NEW AUTHORITY ALREADY EXIST AT THE PC -- THIS BILL SIMPLY EXPAND IT TO A STATE CONTROLLED ENTITY THIS BILL WILL NOT INTERFERE AT ALL WITH PROCUREMENT AS IT CURRENTLY HAPPENS BY THOSE SERVICING ENTITIES AND IT IS NARROWLY DEFINED TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC. RESIDUAL GAPS IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE. IN FACT IF THERE ARE NO NEEDS ON THE GRADE THE IDEAS THAT THIS ENTITY WOULD NOT BE USED AT ALL. AB FIFTY SIX DESIGNS THE NEW FUNCTION OF KATE BUT TO OPERATE LIKE A UTILITY THAT ONLY ACTS WHEN DIRECTED ME TO BY THE STATE AND IS SUBJECT TO STRICT STATE OVERSIGHT. THIS IS THE RIGHT MOVE FOR CALIFORNIA ON BEHALF OF THE AUTHOR I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE HERE WITH US HERE WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY IS NOT FRIEDMAN FROM THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MATT FRIEDMAN I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK IN SUPPORT OF AB. FIFTY SIX WHICH WOULD AUTHORIZE THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE ENERGY IN ADVANCE TRANSPORTATION FINANCING AUTHORITY TO SERVE AS A BACKSTOP PROCUREMENT ENTITY. FOR ELECTRICITY AND RELIABILITY PRODUCTS UNDER SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES ON BEHALF OF RETAIL ATROCITY CUSTOMERS WITHIN THE STATE. THE APPROACH HERE IS DESIGNED TO RECONCILE THE RAPID EVOLUTION OF RETAIL ELECTRICITY MARKETS WITH THE STATE'S CLEAN ENERGY RESOURCE PLANNING AND RELIABILITY POLICIES. CAVE TO COULD SERVE AS AN IMPORTANT TOOL THAT WOULD BE USED TO PROVIDE VARIOUS TYPES OF RESIDUAL ON BACKSTOP PROCUREMENT. SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND APPROVAL BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE P. YOU SEE TODAY HAS SUBSTANTIAL AUTHORITY TO ORDER BACKSTOPS PROCUREMENT UNDER EXISTING LAW. YOU SEE TODAY. MAY DIRECTOR CENTRAL BUYER TO PROCURE RESOURCE ADEQUACY WITH COST COLLECTED FROM ALL CUSTOMERS. THE P. YOU SEE MAY DIRECT THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO SATISFY SYSTEM WIDE UNMET NEED UNDER THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROGRAM WITH COST COLLECTED FROM ALL CUSTOMERS. AND IT MAY AUTHORIZE A VOLUNTARY ENTITY TO CONDUCT RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD COMPLIANCE PROCUREMENT. IF A SMALL LOAD SERVING ENTITY REQUEST THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPT INTO SUCH A STRUCTURE. AB FIFTY SIX WOULD ESSENTIALLY CREATE A PUBLIC OPTION. THAT ALLOWS TAKE. FIVE TO BE SELECTED BY THE P. YOU SEE FOR THESE PURPOSES INSTEAD OF THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. NOTHING IN THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO MODIFY OR EXPAND THE P. UC'S EXISTING AUTHORITY UNDER ANY OF THESE PROGRAMS. CHANGES TO THE P. UC'S AUTHORITY OVER RESOURCE ADEQUACY OR INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING OR THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD PROGRAM. ARE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL. WE UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL HAVE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THESE EXISTING PROGRAMS. BUT I BELIEVE MANY OF THEIR CRITIQUES WOULD RELATE TO EXISTING LAW AND NOT TO WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED IN THIS BILL AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS. TO CLARIFY THAT AB FIFTY SIX DOES NOT EXPAND THE SCOPE OF THE P. UC'S EXISTING AUTHORITY TO ORDER BACKSTOPS RETIREMENT. AND DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY NEW AUTHORITY FOR THE P. YOU SEE TO ENGAGE IN OVERSIGHT. OF COMMITTEE CHOICE AGGREGATORS. OR ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDERS AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE TAKEN IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS TODAY REFLECT THAT COMMITMENT -- EXISTING PROCUREMENT BACKSTOPS IN THE STATE. TODAY INVOLVED THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND THE CALIFORNIA EYES SO AND WE THINK THEIR REASONS FOR MOVING AWAY FROM THESE BACKSTOPS AND TOWARDS A PUBLIC OPTION. THERE ARE GROWING CONCERNS ABOUT THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO THEIR CREDIT CHALLENGES. AND THE FACT THAT THERE IS A GENERAL BELIEF THAT THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES MAY BE BEST SUITED. TO SERVE AS WIRES ONLY COMPANIES TO FOCUS ON THE SAFE AND RELIABLE OPERATION OF THEIR DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSMISSION NETWORKS. IN TERMS OF THE CALIFORNIA ISO. YES ARE YOUR TIME IS UP TO YOU CAN FINISH UP. THANK YOU I I GUESS I'LL JUST END BY SAYING I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT ALTER THE EXISTING AUTHORITY THE COMMISSION. AND IT PRESERVES THE AUTHORITY OF EMERGING RETAIL PROVIDERS TO MAKE THEIR OWN RESOURCE PLANNING CHOICES WE THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THE CONVERSATION WITH A VARIETY OF STAKEHOLDERS IF THE BILL MOVES OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY THANK YOU WE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU FOR ANYONE ELSE WHO WISHES TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. YES MADAM CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THAT CARL LUNDEN HERE ABOUT THE BIOMASS ENERGY ALLIANCE. SPACE COULD THE TRADE ASSOCIATION OF THE BIOMASS INDUSTRY -- WE'RE ALSO SUPPORTING BILLS WELL THANK YOU PAUL PEOPLE BRIEF. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR MARK A PRAYER ON BEHALF OF CHARGE POINT A MAJOR PROVIDER OF THE THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE ARE DRIVE OUT. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. OKAY WILL HAVE A THREE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OF YOU CAN COME TO THE TABLE. TAKE TWO MINUTES PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M JEFF CIPHERS VICE PRESIDENT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY CHOICE ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT NINETEEN LOCAL PUBLIC CCA POWER AUTHORITIES SERVING A POPULATION OF TEN MILLION PEOPLE. THIS BILL IS SEEKING TO SOLVE A REAL PROBLEM BUT AS RECOGNIZED IN THE ASSEMBLY UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE IT NEEDS FURTHER WORK TO GET IT RIGHT. AND NSURE IT ISN'T JUST A POWER GRAB BY THE CBC. WE DO NEED TO PROTECT GRADE RELIABILITY BUT WE NEED TO DO IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T HARM. A RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS CCA'S WORK CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE MARKET STABILITY DURING PEONIES FIRST BANKRUPTCY. BACK THEN GAMING BY SOME ENERGY COMPANIES CONTRIBUTED THE BLACKOUTS AND HIGH RATES WE NOW HAVE OPERATING CCA'S. AND THEIR STRONG INTEREST IN STOCKTON AND AROUND CALIFORNIA TO EXPAND REPAIR AN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS CCA'S PROVIDE. THE CURRENT BILL WHATEVER CENTRAL BUYER HANDLE RESOURCE ADEQUACY. RENEWABLE ENERGY AND EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS BUT WE AGREE WITH THIS COMMITTEES ANALYSIS THAT PROCUREMENT AUTHORITY SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON SPECIFIC UNMET NEEDS. NOT ON QUOTE ANY OBJECTIVES AUTHORIZED BY THE PC. CCA'S ARE ON TRACK TO BUILD TEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF DIVERSE AND WELL INTEGRATED NEW RENEWABLE SOURCES BY. TWENTY THIRTY SO IT MAKES NO SENSE TO INCLUDE RENEWABLE ENERGY OR RENEWABLE ENERGY INTEGRATION IN THE BILL. BUT RESOURCE ADEQUACY IS DIFFERENT AND WE ENCOURAGE SLIMMING THIS BILL DOWN TO FOCUS SOLELY ON THAT MATTER. IT'S IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT THE CONSTRUCTION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY ISN'T ACCIDENTALLY STOPPED HOWEVER BECAUSE HE SEES ARE DEVELOPING THOSE TEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS FOR BOTH ENERGY AND RESOURCE ADEQUACY. THOSE TWO THINGS ALWAYS GO TOGETHER IN EVERY PROJECT. WE WOULD SUPPORT THE COMMITTEE AMENDING THE BILL TO CREATE A DEFAULT PROCUREMENT ENTITY FOR RESOURCE ADEQUACY ALONE. AND THAT INCLUDES LOCAL RELIABILITY WE ALSO ASKED THE COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THAT NEEDS ARE COORDINATED BETWEEN ENERGY COMMISSION THE I SO IN THE PC. AND TO CONTINUE ALLOWING ELECTRIC PROVIDERS TO SELF PROVIDE RESOURCES AS THEY DO NOW. FOR ANY SHORTCOMINGS THE CENTRAL DEFAULT BUYER WOULD STEP IN AND BY THE REMAINING THESE NEEDED RESOURCES AND ASSIGN THOSE COSTS. TO ANYONE WHO DIDN'T PARK HERE -- AND THEY WOULD DO THAT ON THE GENERATION SIDE OF THE BILL. SO WITH GOODS BACKSTOP PROCUREMENT LIKE THAT WE CAN PROTECT OUR GRADE WITHOUT HURTING RATE PAYERS. ENERGY JOBS WHERE THE CLIMATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE IN OPPOSITION. FOR MEMBERS REBEKAH LEE ON BEHALF OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON WE HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS WITH THE BILL IMPRINTS. AND YET TO BE ABLE TO ANALYZE THE AMENDMENT AS PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE HOWEVER -- OUR PERSPECTIVE IS THAT CALIFORNIA DOES NOT NEED A CENTRAL BUYER FOR PREFER RESOURCE POLICY PROCUREMENT WING AT A CENTRAL PLANNER TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL RETAIL PROVIDERS COME THROUGH ON THE PROMISE TO DELIVER THE CLEAN ENERGY GOALS OF THAT'S BEEN LAID OUT BY THIS LEGISLATURE -- AND WITH THESE CONCERNS WE ARE GOING OVER THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION OR THE GENIE MINOR ON BEHALF OF MARIN CLEAN ENERGY AND SEE THE STATE'S FIRST CCA ALSO IN OPPOSITION APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND GETS AS STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT DO THINK THERE'S THERE'S STILL SOME LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT'S BROAD AND WOULD. APPLY TO OUR PROCUREMENT AUTONOMY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CATHERINE BRANDENBURG REPRESENTING CINEMA CLEAN POWER WE ARE ALSO OPPOSED -- TO FOR THE PREVIOUS COMMENTS MADE BY THE SPEAKER THANK YOU.

WE'VE ALREADY EXPRESSED OUR CA ARE A SUPPORT FOR ON THE CENTRAL BUYER OPTION AT THE P. YOU SEE IN TERMS OF RESOURCE ADEQUACY. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS CONVERSATION BROADENS -- THERE ARE NUMBER OF COMPLEX ISSUES OF P. GENIE IS OPEN TO HAVING THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS -- AND AUTHORS OF THE BILL THANK YOU. HEY THANK YOU WITHOUT ALL MOVE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE IF ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE ANY COMMENTS. QUESTION. THANK YOU -- I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS THE WORK IN PROGRESS SO I WILL VOTE FOR IT BUT I HAVE. I HAVE BEEN HEARING TO THIS CONFLICT IN. OPINIONS ABOUT THE BILL FROM THE CCA'S AND AND FROM THE MEMBER SO CAN YOU MAYBE. CLARIFY SOME OF THAT FROM ME OR WHERE WE'RE AT AND IN FINDING SOME COMMON GROUND THERE AND HOW TO CEASE WILL OR WON'T BE AFFECTED RIGHT SO -- ESTATE ADS AS WE STATED ANY OTHER DUTIES AS DEFINED HAS BEEN WELL WE'RE TAKING THAT AMENDMENT ALSO THIS DOESN'T EXPAND I THINK THAT THE CCA'S I HAVE CCA'S IN MY OWN DISTRICT AND SO -- AND CITIES LIKE HAWTHORNE THAT HAVE I HAVE ENJOYED WORKING WITH CCA'S AND SO. I THINK THAT THE CONCERNED MOSTLY AT THIS POINT. THIS DOESN'T EXPAND NY OF THE PC'S RESPONSIBILITIES OR AUTHORITIES OVER THE CCA'S I THINK THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE IN PLACE RIGHT NOW THAT THIS SPECIES ARE NOT HAPPY ABOUT HOWEVER. WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THEM ON AND WE ARE NOT TRYING TO EXPAND THAT THAT AT THE ALREADY THIS IS REALLY NEED TO BE USED AS A BACKSTOP -- BECAUSE WE HAVE WE DO FACE SUCH ISSUES RIGHT NOW WITH OUR UTILITY SYSTEM -- OKAY SO I WILL. WAIT A I WILL FOR THE DAY BUT BECAUSE OF THE CCA'S THAT I HAVE IN MY DISTRICT AND THEY'RE NEAR CCA'S THERE FOR HE NOW AND I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO SAY. THE LAURIE BECAUSE I SEE IT HERE OR NOT -- AND JUST MOVING FOR THAT THIS IS ONE OF I GUESS NOT THE ATTITUDE THAT IN MIND I HAVE NO PROBLEM VOTING FOR A TWO DAY -- AND I AND I TRUST THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM TO GET THEM TO ACCOUNTABLE SPOT AND AND OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT MY BILL BUT I BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT AS A CO AUTHOR I AM HAPPY TO COME DOWN AND SIT WITH YOU AND KIND OF WALK. THROUGH SOME OF THE COMPLEXITIES THAT I BELIEVE WERE SOME OF THE CCA'S ISSUES AND CONCERNS RIGHT NOW BUT THE GOAL IS NOT TO INTERFERE WITH THEIR BUSINESS MODEL AS IT STANDS TODAY. OKAY -- AND AND THEN JUST MOVING FORWARD AND AND NOT IN THIS BILL THAT I I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE'RE HAVING DISCUSSION. WERE ALSO HAVING A DISCUSSION ABOUT RESOURCE ADEQUACY AND IN THE BIGGER PICTURE US I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO ADOPT THIS AT THIS POINT BUT I DO THINK THAT. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED AS AS WE'RE HAVING DISCUSSIONS AND NOT EXPECTED TO SHOW UP IN THIS BILL BUT I I DID WANT TO BRING THAT POINT FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS EGGMAN. JUST THE KIND OF THE CHIME IN WITH DISCUSSION I KNOW THIS IS NOT YOUR BILL AND THEN YOU ARE. THE SECOND COMMITTEE I'VE SEEN YOU PRIVATE. AND AND I WOULD JUST ECHO THE COMMENTS I MADE IN THE FIRST COMMITTEE AT THE PROBLEM IT NEEDS TO BE SOLVED WE WE GOT TO MAKE SURE WE GET IT RIGHT. YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF INPUT FROM A LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO KNOWN NURSE ALONG AND AND MAKE SURE IT GETS IN A PLACE WHERE WE CAN ALL FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT FORGETS THE FLOOR. AND AND I APPRECIATE IT IS A VERY BIG CONCEPT I UNDERSTAND THAT ANY AND IT WILL TAKE TIME AND I THINK THAT THIS AUTHOR WE ALL KNOW WILL PUT THE TIME IN AND WERE HOW OBVIOUSLY OUR HOUSE OFFICES HAPPY AS LONG WHILE HE IS NOT HERE. TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH HIM IN HIS OFFICE -- ON THAT STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS BILL -- ARRIVES AT A PROPER POINT. MR MERCHANT THANK YOU. MS BURKE I KNOW THIS IS NOT YOUR BILL. AND AND AND AND RIGHT I I FEEL -- THAT FOR MISTER GARCIA THAT THAT -- HE'S NOT ABLE TO TO JOIN US -- A THE A I I AM CONCERNED THOUGH THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS THE SECOND POLICY COMMITTEE HEARING THAT. THAT I'M HEARING THIS BILL. AND YET THE CONCERNS OF THE CCA'S. THEY DON'T SEEM TO FEEL. THAT THEIR CONCERNS HAVE BEEN ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED. AND YOU KNOW I I I AM CONCERNED THAT. pTHIS COMPROMISE HAS BEEN MADE IT STILL. AN INFRINGEMENT ON THE CC PROCUREMENT AUTONOMY -- AND SO I YOU KNOW I I I FEEL THAT OF A FOR US TO BE DOING OUR JOB AS AS THE THE POLICY COMMITTEE AND FOR ME ESPECIALLY AT HEARING THIS IN THE SECOND POLICY COMMITTEE THAT -- AS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF CCA A PROCUREMENT TANAMI -- I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE IN VOTING FOR THE BILL I WAS WANTED TO SEE IF YOU CAN CHANGE MY MIND. I I WOULD SAY THAT I THINK THE OPPOSITION EVEN MENTION THAT WE HAVE TAKEN OUT ANY OTHER DUTIES AS DEFINED IN WE HAVE MADE SOME SOME PROGRESS I THINK THE OPPOSITION DID SAY THAT DURING THEIR DURING THEIR REMARKS AND SO. I IT IS GOING TO TAKE TIME AND WE DO ARE DEALING WITH A FEW CHALLENGES BUT WE ARE MOVING WE ARE MOVING ACTUALLY I BELIEVE IN A DIRECTION. THAT I HOPE WE ARE HOPING AT SOME POINT THE CCA'S WILL BE COMFORTABLE WITH BUT WE ARE WE HAVE MOVED WE HAVE HAD SOME POSITIVE MOTION JUST SO THAT YOU'RE AWARE AND I WAS AWARE OF YOUR CONCERNS IN THE LAST COMMITTEE -- AND WE TOOK THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS COMMITTEE TO START TO ADDRESS SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS AND I WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS THAT. MAY I ASK THE CCA FOR THEIR WHEAT WHICH YOU WERE. YEAH YOU CONFIDENT THAT THIS IS A YEAR YOU'RE GOING TO GET. TO NO I'M NOT ALTHOUGH I DO WELCOME. THE OTHER IN THE SPONSOR -- AND AND WAS CRISTINA GARCIA AS WELL -- ABOUT EXTENDING THAT. EXTENDING THAT OFFER TO MEET AND AND AND WORK ON THE BILL SO I APPRECIATE THAT -- AND AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CONVERSATION I THINK THERE'S THERE'S DEEP CONCERNS THIS IS NOT JUST A BILL THAT REITERATES EXISTING LAW. THIS IS A BILL THAT DOES HARDEN DOWN THE IDEA THAT THE CPC HAS POWER. TO COMPEL PROCUREMENT ON BEHALF OF THE CCA WITHOUT AN EXPLICIT AND STATED RIGHT FOR THE CCA OR OR ANYONE ANY OTHER TYPE OF PROVIDER TO SELF PROVIDE FIRST. AND THAT PRINCIPLE IS MISSING FROM THE BILL IT WAS DESCRIBED AS A BACKSTOP BILL BUT IT'S NOT WRITTEN THAT WAY IT'S WRITTEN AS BACKSTOPS IF THE CPUC CHOOSES TO USE IT THAT WAY. OR FOR PROCUREMENT OF THE CPC CHOOSES TO USE IT THAT WAY THAT'S A DEEP PROBLEM BECAUSE THAT DOES OVERSTEP JURISDICTION DRAMATICALLY COMPARED EXISTING LAW. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU.

THANK YOU -- MR LEVINE. OF YOUR UP WITH SIX SIXTY TO BEGIN GIVE ME ONE BILLION DOLLARS YEAH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB SIX SIXTY DIRECTS THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION BY TWENTY THIRTY TO INCREASE THE SOLAR REFLECTANCE REQUIREMENT FOR STEEP ROOFS. ON EXISTING NON RESIDENTIAL AND RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. ENERGY EFFICIENT RUSS ARE ALSO KNOWN AS COOL ROOFS THESE RIFFS ARE DESIGNED TO REFLECT MORE SUNLIGHT ABSORB LESS HEAT THAN A STANDARDROOF. THESE PROPERTIES HELP LOWER ROOF AN ATTIC TEMPERATURES ON HOT SEVENTY DAYS TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR AIR CONDITIONING. THE CURRENT REAL FLAT REFLECTING STANDARD FOR BOTH NON RESIDENTIAL AND LOW RISE RESIDENTIAL IS 20% THIS BILL SENSIBLE 40% BY THE END OF THE NEXT DECADE WITH ME TO DESCRIBE. THE BENEFITS OF INCREASING THE CORE OF STANDARD IS DOCTOR RONIN LEVINSON WITH LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY. THANK YOU LIKE MINUTES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR UP MY NAME IS FROM ELEVEN CINEMA STAFF SCIENTIST LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY THE VIEWS PRESENTED HERE ARE MINE IS AN EXPERT OR NOT INTENDED TO REFLECT ANY POSITION OF LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OR THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. RESIDENTIAL COOL REQUIREMENTS OF INVOLVED A LITTLE SINCE THEY WERE INTRODUCED IN CALIFORNIA'S BUILDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS OVER A DECADE AGO. TITLE TWENTY FOUR PART SIX PRESCRIBE SCHOOL ROUTES FOR HOMES IN ONLY SIX OF THE STATE'S SIXTEEN CLIMATE ZONES. BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS PERFORMED BY LBNL FOR THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TITLE TWENTY FOUR CODE CYCLE INCLUDED TWO KEY ASSUMPTIONS. FIRST IT MODEL NEW HOMES IN A WELL INSULATED ROOFS RATHER THAN EXISTING HOMES OF POORLY INSULATED ROOFS. CORPS OF PRODUCTS ARE MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN ROOFS HAVE LITTLE INSULATION. SECOND IT MODELED LOWER PERFORMANCE RESIDENTIAL COOL ROOFING PRODUCTS H. SOUL REFLECTANCE 20%. RATHER THAN HIGHER PERFORMANCE RESIDENTIAL PRODUCTS WITHIN H. REFLECTANCE OF 40%. OR PERFORMANCE RESIDENTIAL COOL ROOF IS NO COOLER THAN A TYPICAL COMMERCIAL BUILDING GRAY ROOF. AND AS MUCH WARMER THAN A TYPICAL COMMERCIAL BUILDING WHITE COOL ROOF. A RECENT STUDY PUBLISHED BY LBNL IN THE PEER REVIEWED JOURNAL ENERGY AND BUILDINGS FOUNDER EARLIER ANNOUNCES SUBSTANTIALLY UNDER ESTIMATED THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF RESIDENTIAL COOL ROOFS. FOR HOMEOWNERS TENANTS AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE KEY POINTS. ABOUT 90% OF RESIDENTIAL ROOF SURFACING MATERIAL SOLD IN CALIFORNIA EACH YEAR IS INSTALLED ON EXISTING HOMES. THE BENEFIT OF A COOL RIFF PRODUCT ON AN EXISTING HOME. IS ABOUT TWO TO FOUR TIMES THAT OF THE SAME PRODUCT ON A NEW HOME. ALSO THE BENEFIT OF A HIGHER PERFORMANCE RESIDENTIAL COOL ROOF PRODUCT IS ABOUT THREE TIMES THAT OF A LOWER PERFORMANCE RESIDENTIAL COOL ROOF PRODUCTS. CONSIDERATION OVER THE NEXT TWELVE YEARS FOR TRAINING -- CODE CYCLES TO RAISING PRODUCT PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR RESIDENTIAL COOL ROOF RETROFITS. AND EXPANDING THE RANGE OF CLIMATE ZONES TO WHICH THESE REP REQUIREMENTS APPLY IT YOUR TIME IS UP IF YOU CAN FINISH UP WE JUST FINISHING THE SENTENCE COULD SUBSTANTIALLY BOOST THE ENERGY CALL ROOF ENERGY COST SAVINGS ENJOYED BY HOMEOWNERS ATTENDANCE AND HELP CALIFORNIA MEET ITS SB THREE FIFTY GOAL. OF DOUBLING ENERGY EFFICIENCY BY TWENTY THREE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. IS THERE ANYBODY HERE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. FOR OKAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE OR ACTUALLY -- ANY COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE OR QUESTIONS.

FIVE ONE OKAY WOULD LEAVE THE ROLE OF AND PERHAPS MEMBERS IT WAS FIVE TO ONE OKAY AND I THINK YOU'RE UP NEXT WITH. SIXTEEN FORTY FOUR YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AT FOURTEEN FORTY SIX REVISED OUTDATED STATUTORY LANGUAGE REGARDING THE EXTRACTION OF OIL AND GAS IN CALIFORNIA. TO PRIORITIZE PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION OVER COMMERCIAL INTEREST IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE PROMOTING IN PRIORITIZING OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION IN THIS THAT THIS BILL WOULD CHANGE WAS ENACTED. BEFORE TRANSPORTATION RELATED SMOG AND THE GOAL OF THE LOS ANGELES BASED IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES. AND BEFORE CALIFORNIA ENACTED THE FIRST TAILPIPE EMISSIONS STANDARD IN. NINETEEN SIXTY SIX END BEFORE THE SANTA BARBARA OIL SPILL OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE AND THE ENSUING STATE MORATORIUM ON OFFSHORE DRILLING. AB FOURTEEN FORTY IS ESSENTIALLY A CAPSTONE ON ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP AND PUBLIC HEALTH AWARENESS EFFORTS THAT TOOK SHAPE IN EARNEST IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND HAVE GROWN IN SUBSEQUENT DECADES. THIS BILL IS ENTIRELY IN KEEPING WITH THE SENTIMENTS OF CALIFORNIANS AT THE CLOSE OF THE SECOND DECADE OF THE CENTURY. WITH ME TODAY ARE TO REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SPONSORS OF THIS LEGISLATION AND ALEXANDER WITH AND ARE DO YOU SEE AND BILL ELIUD OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP. THANK YOU I AM BILL ALLEY -- WITH THE EWG THE AIM AND SUBSTANCE OF AB FOURTEEN FORTY A STRAIGHT FORWARD TO MODERNIZE THE STATUTES REGULATING OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT BY REMOVING LANGUAGE IT'S AN ARTIFACT WITH VERY DIFFERENT TIME IN OUR HISTORY. EARLY IN THE LAST CENTURY AGENCIES REGULATING OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION CALIFORNIA TWO MAIN GOALS TO EVENT THE KIND OF HARM TO OIL AND GAS RESERVES THAT CAN HAPPEN AND AND REGULATED. DRILLING FREE FOR ALL AND TO MAXIMIZE EXTRACTION WHICH COULD ALSO MEAN MORE REVENUE TO THE STATE. THESE MAY HAVE BEEN FINE GOALS AT THE TIME THAT DRILLING FREE FOR ALLS ARE NO LONGER HAPPENING THANKS IN SIGNIFICANT PART. TO THE EVOLVING OF DOCTOR THE DIVISION OF OIL AND GAS EIGHTY YEARS LATER WE NOW UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS THAT ACTUALLY ATTEND THESE DRILLING OPERATIONS. A REGULATORY STATE AGENCIES SHOULD NOT HAVE A GOAL OF ALLOWING THE MAXIMUM OUT OF OIL AND GAS. TO BE EXTRACTED OUT OF THE GROUND BUT INSTEAD TO ALLOW EXTRACTION IN A MATTER THAT IS SAFE TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND TO RESIDENTS NEAR THE DRILLING -- THIS A THESE THIS BILL AS PART OF A REFORMED ONGOING REFORM TO DOCTOR THEY'VE COME A LONG WAYS IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE TO KEEP THAT REFORM GOING. IN ALL TURNED OVER TO MY CO SPONSOR FOR THE REST OF THE STORY. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M AND ALEXANDER WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. AB FOURTEEN FORTIES PURPOSE IS VERY SIMPLE IT IS AIMED AT MODERNIZING AND CLARIFYING THE MISSION STATEMENTS AND FINDINGS AND THE STATUTES THAT GOVERN OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA. IT WOULD DO THAT FIRST BY ELIMINATING LANGUAGE AND BOTH THE DOCTOR STATUTE AND THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION STATUTE. THAT ARTICULATE AND OUTDATED POLICY OF MAXIMIZING OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION AND SECONDLY IT WOULD CLARIFY THE CURRENT DUAL MANDATE IN THE DOCTOR STATUTE BY pAND SAFETY SHOULD BE GIVEN PRIMACY IN AGENCY DECISION MAKING. WHICH IS OF COURSE SOUND PRACTICE FOR ANY MODERN REGULATORY AGENCY. NOW TO BE EQUALLY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THIS LEGISLATION WOULD NOT DO -- FOURTEEN FORTY WOULD CREATE NO NEW PROCESS SEES OR REVIEW REQUIREMENTS AND IT DOES NOT STATE A POLICY EITHER AGAINST OR IN FAVOR OF CALIFORNIA PRODUCTION IT'S SIMPLY RENDERS THE STATUTE NEUTRAL ON THAT POLICY QUESTION IS IT SHOULD BE. THESE CHANGES ARE VERY SIMILAR IN SPIRIT TO REFORMS THAT WERE JUST SIGNED INTO LAW IN THE STATE OF COLORADO. MUCH ALIKE AB FOURTEEN FORTY COLORADO'S SB ONE EIGHTY ONE ELIMINATED A REQUIREMENT THAT THE REGULATORY AGENCY QUOTE UNQUOTE FOSTER OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT THAT'S CREATING A COMPETING MANDATE. OF THE SORT THAT WE HAVE HERE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE STAFF AND THE SPONSORS -- HAVE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH DOCTOR REGARDING SOME RELATIVELY MINOR CHANGES TO IMPROVE THE LEGISLATION AND WE ANTICIPATE THOSE WILL CONTINUE. AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE MR LEVINE SUPPORT FOR THIS COMMON SENSE PROPOSAL TO BRING CALIFORNIA'S LAWS GOVERNING OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION INTO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. WAIT RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. PLEASE JUST YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION ANDREY WILL WITH ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND HERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU YEAH. MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT. BRIAN A WIKI WITH THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU OPPOSITION. THANK YOU TWO MINUTES EACH. GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- PF ANY THOMAS. REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION. I WERE IN OPPOSITION. TO AB ONE FOREIGN -- ONE FOUR FOUR ZERO IT IN THE BILL AS AMENDED VERSION MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- IT'S SOMEWHAT CONFUSING FOR EXAMPLE ACTUAL SECTION THIRTY ONE SIXTY OF THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE -- DOES A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE IT PROVIDES A BALANCE IN PRODUCTION AND THE AUTHORITY TO IMPLEMENT THE SAFEST OIL IN AFTER GAS PRETTY PRODUCED IN OUR NATION. THE SECOND THING THAT IT DOES IT IS APPROVED IT IS IMPROVE IT IS PRUDENT. IN ITS REALITY OF RISK IN THE INDUSTRY THAT WE DO HAVE. HOWEVER WITH YOU WHEN YOU GO TO PAGE FOUR OF THE BILL PAGE. FOUR LINES ONE THROUGH THREE SMALL DE. THEY'VE BEEN DELETED FROM THE BILL. NOW WHAT'S BEEN DELETED IS AS FOLLOWS TO BEST MEET ALL THE GAS NEEDS IN THE STATE. THE SUPERVISOR THE DOCTOR SUPERVISOR SHALL ADMINISTER THIS DIVISIONS SO AS TO ENCOURAGE THE WISE DEVELOPMENT. THE WISE DEVELOPMENT OF OIL AND GAS RESOURCES. IF IT IS ON THE TERM WISE DEVELOPMENT. BEING THE OPTIMAL TERM. IF WE AREN'T WISELY DEVELOPING OIL AND GAS AND THAT'S BEEN REMOVED FROM THE BILL THAN WHAT WE GOING TO DO IN SO FAR AS DEVELOPING FALLING GAS. WHAT'S WRONG WITH MEDIAN NEEDS OF THE STATE IN A SAFE AND WEISS MATTER I ASKED. IF THE BILL IS SIGNED INTO LAW. IT WILL BE A BLANKET GOLD LIGHT FOR IMPORTS MEMBERS WE CURRENTLY PAY EIGHTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS A DAY. WE PAY EIGHTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS A DAY FOR IMPORTS. IF THE POLICY IS TO KEEP IT IN THE GROUND THEN MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR AND THEN WE CAN HAVE THAT POLICY DISCUSSION THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL IN A BERKELEY DOES. BY CHANGING THE TERM MAXIMUM OUT OF THE IN FACT. OTHER THE MISSION STATEMENT SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO ENTER BUT ALL OF US ARE GONE. IN THE FUTURE WHO'S GOING INTERPRET WHAT MINIMUM IS WHAT MAXIMUM IS BUT THE MIDDLE LINE IS SO AS I CLOSE THIS BILL MAY IN FACT PASSED OUT OF COMMITTEE. BUT I THINK THE RESIDENTS OF THE STATE DESERVE A CLEAR EXPLANATION OF WHAT COMES NEXT IF WE IN FACT LOSE PRODUCTION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN CLOSING I WOULD JUST SAYS IS THE JOB OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ASSIST IN MEETING THE ENERGY NEEDS AND DEMANDS OF THE RESIDENTS. HI BUT SAY AFFIRMATIVE. FOURTEEN FORTY FOUR DOES NOTHING OF THAT SORT NOW WHEN COURAGE NO VOTE ON THE BILL. THANK YOU. MANAGER MEMBERS THE LEGACY FOR THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING THE STATE'S MAJOR OIL. PRODUCERS AND REFINERS IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AND JUST -- BY WAY OF FROM HISTORY OF FROM HER PERSPECTIVE -- THE ASSEMBLYMAN MENTIONED ALL OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED SINCE. OF THAT STATUTE WAS -- IMPLEMENTED OR PUT AN INPUT IN STATUTE. I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. CALIFORNIA HAS A HISTORY OF DEVELOPING ITS. HYDROCARBON RESOURCES IT HAS HAD A HISTORY AND HAD A GROWTH BECAUSE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF ITS HYDROCARBON RESOURCES. WHEN THIS BILL LANGUAGE IS PUT IN STATURE TO WISELY DEVELOP ITS RESOURCES? A COUPLE THINGS WILL SAID AS WE DEVELOP THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. WE BUILT ADEQUATE DUCT WE BUILT A HIGHWAY SYSTEM WE DID A LOT OF MONUMENTAL THINGS IN CALIFORNIA IN A LARGE PART DUE TO THE RESOURCES THAT WERE DEVELOPED IN STATE. SO WE WE APPRECIATE THE IDEA OF MODERNIZING OUR STATUTE. BUT WE DON'T MODERNIZE BY GOING IN AND JUST EXCISING A PIECE OF THE STATUE WE DO A BY RECOGNIZING. HOW WE DEVELOPED OUR REGULATORY STRUCTURE? IN THE LAST TEN YEARS. THE DEVELOP THE PRODUCTION OF OIL AND GAS IS UNDERGONE A TREMENDOUS TREMENDOUS -- RESTRUCTURING. MANY OF BILLS THAT YOU ALL VOTED FOR SB FOUR SB. TWELVE EIGHTY ONE THE PUSH FOR THE COMPLETELY RESTRUCTURING OF THE UNDERGROUND TRACTION CONTROL PROGRAM WE HAVE COMPLETELY RESTRUCTURED HOW WE REGULATE OIL AND GAS IN CALIFORNIA LAST TEN YEARS. AND THAT'S NOT BECAUSE WE GO BACK TO THE DIGITAL OIL AND GAS AND AND EXCISE OUT PART OF ITS MISSION WE ADD TO THAT WE'VE ADDED. THE VERY VERY MUCH A STRONG ROLE. FOR THE REGIONALLY -- WATER BOARDS THE STATE WATER BOARD THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC STOP THE SUBSTANCE CONTROL THEY ALL PLAY SIGNIFICANT ROLES IN THE PROTECTION. OF THE OF OUR COMMUNITIES IN THE PROTECTION OF OUR RESOURCES. SO IT'S NOT SIMPLY LOOKING AT THE DAHLE MANDATE -- THAT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE TO SIMPLY LOOK AT THE DIVISION ONE GAS AND SAY WELL LET'S JUST TAKE THAT AWAY AND WE'LL JUST DO IT THIS WAY WE'VE ADDED AN ENTIRELY NEW REGULATORY STRUCTURE ON TOP OF THE DIVISION OF OIL AND GAS. IN FACT BECAUSE OF BILLS THAT YOU ALL HAVE APPROVED AND BUDGETS OVER THE LAST. I WOULD SAY FIVE YEARS. YOU'VE TURNED WHAT -- THE PRODUCTION OF OIL AND GAS INTO A DATA GATHERING. BUSINESS YEAR GATHERING NINE BILLION DATA POINTS FROM OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT EVERY YEAR. HERE YOU'RE GETTING SO MUCH DATA ABOUT WHERE YOU TO WHERE YOU PRODUCE WHERE THE WATER IS THE EMISSIONS. HERE GETTING SO MUCH DATA THAT YOU HAD TO BUILD AN ENTIRELY NEW. DATA -- SYSTEM WHICH FEELING GAS IS PAYING FOR SO THAT YOU CAN TAKE IN THAT DATA FOR THE YOU CAN. USE IT. NOT ONLY FOR REGULAR WOULD MAKE AVAILABLE TO YOU AS POLICY MAKERS AND TO THE PUBLIC. SO THIS THE LANDSCAPE IN TERMS OF OIL PRODUCTION IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. IT IS DIFFERENT THAN WHEN THE STATUTE WAS ORIGINALLY. PUT IN IN THE CODE BUT IT'S ALSO. ONE IT SHOULD BE REFLECTED HOW MUCH WORK IS BEING DONE NOW BY OTHER. BY ALL OF THE OTHER STATE AGENCIES WE OPPOSE THIS BILL WAS ONE MORE SECOND BECAUSE IT WILL CREATE. A HUGE AMOUNT OF REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY FOR THE ACTUAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESOURCE. FOR THAT REASON WE OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION [inaudible] AND POSITION. WE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE OPPOSE THIS BILL FOR THE REASONS STATED THE REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY IS DEADLY PROBLEM IF WE'RE GONNA ATTACK SUPPLY BUT NOT.

MATHIS I MCCARTY. MELENDEZ BROUGHT TO JUNE STONE [inaudible] THREE ZERO SEVERAL OPEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT. WE HAVE. MR SALAS. MOVE THE BILL. THERE HAS BEEN IN MOTION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AND YOUR PRESENT IN AB SIXTEEN SEVENTY THREE THAT'S CORRECT ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU PLEASE RISEN ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN SEVENTY THREE TO THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THIS BILL WILL CREATE TRANSPARENCY AROUND ANONYMOUS SEQUEL LAWSUITS BY REQUIRING THE DISCLOSURE THE PARTICIPATING PARTIES WERE FUNDING SICK WHAT CHALLENGES. AN HONEST LAWSUITS ARE UNIQUE TO SEEK WERE AND ARE RARELY ALLOWED IN OTHER AREAS OF OUR LEGAL SYSTEM. IN FACT AB SIXTEEN SEVENTY THREE IS CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT JUDICIAL PRACTICE. IN THE COUNTRY WHICH GENERALLY DISAPPROVES OF ANONYMOUS LITIGATION. THE ABILITY FOR INDIVIDUALS OR GROUPS TO FILE NONE OF US LAWSUITS REPRESENTS. A BLAME LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN OPENS THE DOOR FOR ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN A DEVELOPER WANTED TO TURN A RUNDOWN MOTEL IN SAN DIEGO. INTO A TRANSITIONAL CENTER FOR THE HOMELESS EVEN THOUGH THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVED THE PROJECT. THE GROUP OF OWNER HOMEOWNERS FILED AN ANONYMOUS EQUAL LAWSUIT UNDER THE GUISE OF AN EVENT OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP. WELL THE JUDGE EVENTUALLY THROUGHOUT THE CASE THE DELAY LASTED SIX MONTHS AND DROVE THE PROJECT TO THE BRINK OF FINANCIAL COLLAPSE. IN AN EXTREME CASE AN OBSCURE ENTITY CALLED BETTER NEIGHBORHOODS FILED NUMEROUS SEQUEL LAWSUITS AGAINST PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO EXTRACT. SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS FROM DEVELOPERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THE BETTER NEIGHBORHOODS GROUP WAS EVENTUALLY TRACED BACK TO A DISBARRED LAWYER. WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY DEFRAUDED HIS CLIENTS? THE CONTINUED EXISTENCE OF ANONYMOUS EQUAL LAWSUITS CAN OCCUR JUST BAD BEHAVIOR AND ALLOW FOR ABUSE. THIS PRACTICE DEPRIVE THE PUBLIC IN THE COURTS OF RELEVANT INFORMATIONWHEN DEALING WITH SEQUEL. THE INTENTIONS OF PEOPLE FILING SEQUEL LAWSUIT SHOULD BE MADE CLEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE CHALLENGING PROJECTS BASED ON LEGITIMATE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS. AB SIXTEEN SEVENTY THREE WOULD CREATE TRANSPARENCY WITH OUR LEGAL SYSTEM BY REQUIRING THE DIRECT FUNDERS OF A CIVIL LAWSUIT. TO DISCLOSE THEIR IDENTITY. IN ADDITION THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY ALLOWS THE COURT TO WIT HOLD PUBLIC DISCLOSURE IF THE PUBLIC INTEREST. IS CAPTAIN KEEPING THE INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL. THIS PRESERVES A NON ENTITY. AND LEGITIMATE CASES WERE DISCOURAGING ANY FUTURE ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR MORE IMPORTANTLY THE BILL DOES NOT WE CAN SEEK WELL WE'RE STREAMLINED CERTAIN PROJECTS IT'S SIMPLY CREATES TRANSPARENCY. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE TO HAVE A TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. AT WRIGLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE I'LL TRY TO BE BRIEF. OBSTACLE SINCE ITS INCEPTION ALMOST FIVE DECADES AGO HAS OPERATED AS A THE LIGHTING LAW THAT. ENGAGE THE PUBLIC IN A OPEN PROCESS WHICH ALLOWS THE PUBLIC AND LEAD AGENCIES TO ANALYZE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS -- MITIGATE THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS IF THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE EXTENT FEASIBLE AND SIX PUBLIC COMMENT -- IT ALSO ALLOWS CITIZENS TO ENFORCE WERE. IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST THE PROBLEM IS SEE WHO HAS THE BROADEST STANDING REQUIREMENTS OF ANY OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL LAW IN THE COUNTRY IT IS NOT UNCOMMON. FOR THOSE SIMPLY OPPOSED. TO A PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENT TO UTILIZE SEEK WORK TOMORROW PROMOTE THEIR PRIVATE INTEREST. UNDER THE GUISE OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST. AND TEY DO SO ENTIRELY ANONYMOUSLY AND OFTEN UNDERSTOOD -- NAMES CREATED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PURPOSES OF DISGUISING THEIR PRIVATE INTERESTS. HOW DO I KNOW I USED TO ACTUALLY LITIGATE? DOING THAT VERY THING. NO OTHER CITIZEN'S SUIT PROVISION ALLOWS THIS NOT THE CLEAN AIR ACT CLEAN WATER ACT THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT OR EVEN SEEK WAS IT NATIONAL COUNTERPART THE NATIONAL OF OUR MIDDLE POLICY ACT. THIS BILL DOES NOTHING MORE THAN A LINE SYKORA WITH ALL OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CITIZENS WHO PROVISIONS BY REQUIRING DISCLOSURE OF THOSE DIRECTLY FUNDING THE LOSSES. IT DOES NOT A ROAD OR EXEMPT ANY SUBSTANTIVE REQUIREMENTS OF SEQUEL IT DOES NOT CHANGE MITIGATION MEASURES. NOR DOES IT AS SOME OPPONENTS OF SAID REQUIRE INDIVIDUAL MEMBERSHIP DISCLOSURE THE EXPRESS LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL ONLY REQUIRES DISCLOSURE. OF THE PERSONS OR ENTITIES CONTRIBUTE DIRECTLY TO THE LAWSUIT THAT DOES NOT. COUNT FOR MEMBERSHIP DUES OR ANY OTHER UNION DUES. YOU MAY ALSO HEAR FIRST AMENDMENT ARGUMENTS THAT THIS BILL IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL CITING A SIXTY YEAR OLD SUPREME COURT CASE. TO BE CLEAR THAT CASE DOES NOT BAR DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT LAWS IF THEY DID EVERY OTHER CITIZEN'S SUIT PROVISION UNDER ALL THE FEDERAL NORMAL LAWS I'VE JUST I'VE STATED EARLIER WOULD BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THAT COURT CASE AND DOUBLE ACP VERSUS PATTERSON SIMPLY SAYS IT'S A BALANCING TEST AND DISCLOSURE SHOULD OUTWEIGH ANONYMITY. THAT IS WHY UNDER THIS BILL. IT PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL LAYER PROTECTION THAT ALLOWS THE COURT TO WITHHOLD DISCLOSURE IF IT FINDS THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN KEEPING THAT INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL CLEARLY OUTWEIGHS THE PUBLIC. INTEREST. TRANSPARENCY THE HALLMARK OF GOOD GOVERNANCE AND WE SUPPORT SEE WHAT TRANSPARENCY WE HOPE YOU SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. HI TODD DAVID ONLY HALF THE BAY AREA HOUSING ADVOCACY COALITION APART RIGHT. LET ME DESCRIBE MYSELF I JUST ASKED FOR ANYONE ELSE IN A POSITION TO KNOW IF YOU KNOW YOUR SUPPORT YEAH YES. ON OKAY IN CS SO TIGHT EVEN WE HAVE THE BAY AREA HOUSING UP TO SEE COALITION AND SO I DON'T I WANT TO REITERATE EVERYTHING THAT WAS SAID I TOTALLY GREAT. THIS ONE TO GIVE A COUPLE OF VERY CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF HOW WE'VE GOTTEN TO A PLACE WERE REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF OB LEGISLATION. TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT IT CAN OFTEN BE WEAPONIZED TO DO ALMOST THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT IT WAS MEANT TO DO. RIGHT SO WE KNOW ON ALMOST EVERY EVERY RESPECTFUL ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP LOOKS TO SEE WHAT AND SAYS THAT WE'VE GOT TO BE BUILDING MORE URBAN INFILL HOUSE LIKE. BUT 87% A SEQUEL LAWSUIT LAWSUITS ARE TARGETED AT URBAN INFILL HOUSING. SO THERE IS THE WEAPONIZATION OF MISUSE OF THE C. QUOTE THAT IS ACTUALLY ADDING UP HURTING OUR ENVIRONMENT. AND I THINK THAT THE GOES PRETTY CLEARLY ARE JUST THE HUMAN EXPERIENCES. ANONYMOUS AND THE NAME OF THE LEADS TO THE WORST BEHAVIOR. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE WAY PEOPLE BEHAVE ONLINE THEY DON'T HAVE TO PUT THEIR NAME ON SOMETHING IT JUST INCENTIVIZE IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST BEHAVIOR? IN SAN FRANCISCO LAST WEEK THERE WAS A SIXTY THREE UNITS. OF HOUSING PROJECT 25% OF WHICH WAS AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. AND A SEQUEL LAWSUIT WAS BROUGHT TO STOP IT BECAUSE IT CAST A SHADOW ON ONE THIRD OF THE BASKETBALL COURT. FOR ONE HUNDRED MINUTES ON THE LONGEST DAY OF THE YEAR. AND IT WAS STOPPED. SIXTY THREE YOU HAVE IT'S ABOUT SIXTY THREE UNITS OF DESPERATELY NEEDED URBAN INFILL HOUSING IN SAN FRANCISCO WAS STOPPED BECAUSE A SHADOW. WAS FOR ONE HUNDRED MINUTES. ON THE LONGEST DAY OF THE YEAR. PREVIOUS TO THAT. BOB HABITAT FOR HUMANITY HAD A PROJECT IN REDWOOD CITY. THAT WAS REALLY BUILD TWENTY UNITS OF WELL IN MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING THAT WAS THE LEAD FOR SIXTEEN MONTHS. pI THINK IS A REALLY SMART FIRST STEP. IT SEEMS LIKE THE MOST OBVIOUS THE MOST EGREGIOUS MISUSES OF SEQUEL ARE DONE IN A NOT TO MISS NATURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION PLEASE JUST THE YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION A POSITION. WHEN IT WAS LIKE A VIRGIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT REALTORS IN SUPPORT? THANK YOU THANK YOU. TURNING TO THE CALIFORNIA PART OF THE SOLUTION HERE SUPPORT. SECOND NOT KNOCK IT OVER HERE JOHNSON CLAN TO HAVE THE COUNTY SAN DIEGO ALL SOME SUPPORT. SAYS THE MATTER THAT LIGHT HOUSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS HERE ON BEHALF OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIANS PART. OKAY THERE'S ANSWERED THE CHARM ANYONE ELSE OF THE PART OPPOSITION OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON BRENNAN DAWSON FOR SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA. WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL IN OUR VIEW -- THE BILL DOES SET UP WHILE DOESN'T LOOK AT THE FIRST AMENDMENT ARGUE -- BECAUSE ANONYMOUS SPEECH IS PROTECTED SPEECH UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT -- AND FUNDING. LAWSUIT IS ANONYMOUSLY IS A CLEARLY A FORMER SPEECH AND ACTIVITY IT DOESN'T OKAY -- FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY AND THE FREEDOM ASSOCIATION -- BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT'S ALSO A KIND OF AN UNWORKABLE BILL INTO ACTUAL IN ACTUALITY -- FIRST OFF I WANT PUSH BACK ON THE ANONYMOUS -- HOW ENORMOUSLY FUNDING SECRET LAWSUIT IS BECOMING A DETRIMENT TO HOUSING PROJECTS -- IF A DEVELOPER WOULD LIKE TO BUILD A HOUSING PROJECT ARE. SEVENTEEN OR SO EXEMPTIONS UNDER SEQUEL FOR HOUSING PROJECTS ALONE -- SPECIFICALLY ONCE TARGETING INFILL PROJECTS ON THEREFORE THEY WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE TO UNDERGO THE SECRET PROCESS THE AND THEY COULD BLOCK PASSING SEQUEL LAWSUITS BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY A STATUTORY EXEMPTION AVAILABLE -- ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL WOULD DETRIMENT ENVIRONMENT A COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS OF AFFORDABLE COMMUNITIES -- BECAUSE THOSE COMMUNITIES RELY ON SELF -- SELF ENACTED BASICALLY SEE WAS A SELF IN ACTING. UP ENFORCEMENT LOS LAW AND IT REQUIRES THE PUBLIC TO COME FORTH IN BECAUSE ANYONE CAN ACTUALLY BRING A LAWSUIT IN THE NAME SI KHOA. THAN. BY REQUIRING THE ON BY REQUIRING SOMEONE TO DISCLOSE WHO IS FINDING THAT LAWSUIT YOU'RE BASICALLY REQUIRING PLAINTIFFS TO GO OUT AND SAY. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION -- ON WHO GAVE ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR THIS TYPE OF LAWSUIT -- AND THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS Là ENVIRONMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL LOCAL COMMUNITIES WHERE THESE PEOPLE ARE COMING OUT AND THEY'RE BASICALLY. SELF FINANCING THESE PROJECTS -- AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE THE BILL -- PRIMARILY BEFORE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T GET THE FIRST MEMBER BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT. IS ON WORKABLE -- AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IT DOES NOT. ACTUALLY -- AFFECT A SEQUEL LAWSUIT STILL ACTUALLY AFFECT HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN THE WAY THAT SOME THE UPON PROPONENTS WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE YOU BELIEVE I WOULD. RECOMMEND THAT YOU LOOK AT SOME OBJECTIVE -- LITIGATION FACTS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE BY NOT ONLY THIS AN ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMPANY AND I'M. COMMITTEE BUT ALSO THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL IN THE PAST SO THANK YOU [inaudible] OPPOSITION. THANK YOU CHELSEA TO SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH THE CENTER ON RACE POVERTY AN ENVIRONMENT.

AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF BILLS THAT WE ALL VOTED ON TO INCREASE DISCLOSURE ACTUALLY INFORMATION -- WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS. WE DON'T SEE THIS BILL IS BENEFITING ONE GROUP OR ANOTHER IT'S JUST TRANSPARENCY BRING TRANSPARENCY TO THE ENTIRE PROCESS. AND SO -- YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY IF YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE PROPONENTS ABOUT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY'VE HAD WITH HOUSING PROJECTS. THAT THEY'VE DEALT WITH SPECIFICALLY OUT IN THE BAY AREA AND THEN FELL. AND TO THE CONSTITUTIONALITY I KNOW THAT -- ADAM SPOKE TO THAT.

EIGHTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE ON THE WAIT LIST. CREATING SMART PRAGMATIC TENET PROTECTIONS AND ASSESSING THEIR EFFECTIVENESS OVER TIME ENSURES THAT STATE FUNDS DESIGNATED FOR THE BENEFIT OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE NOT MISS USE DUE TO INTENSE HOUSING MARKET CONDITIONS. COORDINATION BETWEEN ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND HEALTH PROGRAMS IS ALSO A DIRECT RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CLEAN ENERGY IN LOW INCOME MULTI FAMILY BUILDINGS ACTION PLAN.

COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M BISHOP BOB JACKSON PASTERNAK'S FULL GOSPEL CHURCH IN EAST OAKLAND I'M HERE TO OPPOSE A. B.. ELEVEN NINETY ONE AB ELEVEN NINETY ONE PLANS TO FACILITATE THE BENEFITS OF DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE AND A WORLD CLASS STADIUM FOR OPEN. IN REALITY THIS LEGISLATION WILL HARM CURRENT RESIDENT AS IT WOULD LEAD TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF LUXURY HOMES RESIDENTS CANNOT AFFORD AND THE BAND THE MEN OF THE EAST OAKLAND COMMUNITY. THERE IS A LACK OF PRIORITIZATION ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN OAKLAND'S EAST OAKLAND ESPECIALLY WITH ONLY 7% OF PROJECTED BUILDINGS RESERVE FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES. PUTTING CURRENT RESIDENCE AT RISK OF BEING PRICED OUT BY RAPIDLY GROWING BAY AREA PRICING. GENTRIFICATION IS ONLY WORKS IN THIS ISSUE AND HAVING BEEN A PART OF THE STOKE ON FOR DECADES I CAN SAY WE DO NOT NEED A PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THAT WILL ONLY EXACERBATE THE EFFECTS OF GENTRIFICATION WITH A LUXURY HOMES IS THAT A FORCE IN THE CHOICE BETWEEN THE WILL. THE WELL BEING OF OPEN RESIDENTS IN A WORLD CLASS STADIUM SUITABLE FOCUS MAYES AN IDEAL OPTION IS RE DEBT REDEVELOPING AND INVESTING IN THE EXISTING. OAKLAND ALAMEDA COUNTY COLISEUM. THE COLISEUM HAS BEEN HOME TO THE OPEN A SINCE THEY PLAYED THEIR FIRST GAME THERE IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX AND BOTH THE STADIUM AND THE TEAM OR ENTER CALL PARTS AT LEAST OPENS IDENTITY AND HISTORY. IN PARTICULAR THE COLISEUM BROUGHT WITH IT INITIAL PROMISES OF NEW PUBLIC TRANSIT AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT JUSTIFIED USING EMINENT DOMAIN TO DISPLACE EAKES. HE'S OAKLAND RESIDENTS MANY DECADES AGO. AB ELEVEN NINETY ONE IS ESSENTIALLY FOR SAKE IN THIS PART OF EAST OPENS LEGACY A LEGACY THAT SHOULD BE REINVIGORATED WITH NEW ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. HAVING THE OAKLAND EIGHTIES REMAIN AND AND REDEVELOP THE CURRENT SITE WITH ADDITIONAL HOUSING AND COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE WILL HONOR THAT HISTORY AND REVITALIZED EAST OAKLAND WITH A WORLD CLASS STADIUM SURROUNDED BY HOUSING RESTAURANTS AND ENTERTAINMENT. IT WOULD BE A MUCH NEEDED INVESTMENT AND TO THE EAST OAKLAND COMMUNITY I URGE THE COMMUNITY TO RECONSIDER A. B. ELEVEN NINETY ONE FOR THE SAKE OF CURRENT RESIDENTS WHO CALL OAKLAND. THEIR HOME. THANK YOU A GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MIGHT TAKE ABOUT THE PACIFIC MERCHANT SHIPPING ASSOCIATION REPRESENT WHICH CARRIES MARINE TERMINAL OPERATOR TENANTS AT THE PORT OF OAKLAND -- AND WHERE OPPOSE THIS LEGISLATION -- BEFORE IT HAPPENS WITH I WANT. TO SAY THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA FOR THE THOUGHT AUTHORS MA'AM IF YOU -- TO WITH RESPECT WOULD BE CDC LANGUAGE -- OUR OUR CONCERNS ARE ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SITE BEING POTENTIALLY INCONSISTENT WITH -- THE THE CDC SEAPORT PLAN -- INCONSISTENT WITH THE THAILAND'S TRUST -- WHAT YOU HEARD FROM THE BILL'S SPONSORS TODAY -- PRESENTS A PLAN WHICH IS INCONSISTENT BOTH WITH THE TITANS TRUST IN THE CURRENT BE CDC PLAN -- THIS BILL IS NOT NECESSARY TO TELL THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION HOW DO THEIR JOB THEY KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. IT'S CERTAINLY NOT NECESSARY TO TELL THE CDC TO DO THEIR JOB SO WE APPRECIATE THOSE AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY THAT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S INTENDED BY THE BILL -- THE REASON WHY THOSE AGENCIES EXISTED TO PROTECT -- WATER FROM RESOURCES BECAUSE WATERFRONT RESOURCES. ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO REPLICATE ONCE THEY'RE GONE THEY'RE GONE. WE BELIEVE THAT ONCE YOU'VE REPLACED A WATERFRONT ASSET LIKE THE HOWARD TERMINAL. WITH HOUSING AND COMMERCIAL REAL SAID THE CAN GO ANYWHERE IN THE US THE STADIUM THAT COULD BE BUILT. AT THE CURRENT LOCATION IS OAKLAND JUST AS WELL THE COULD BE ANYWHERE ELSE -- THAT YOU'VE DONE IRREPARABLE HARM TO OUR BUSINESS YOU'VE DONE A REPROBATE HARM TO THE REGION AND TO THE OVERALL ECONOMY OF CALIFORNIA WE CAN'T REPLICATE THE BENEFITS THAT COME FROM HAVING A WORKING COURT. ANYWHERE ELSE EXCEPT ON DEEP WATER -- AND WE ARE REALLY PROUD OF WORKING WITH FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY LIKE BISHOP -- BUT ALSO WITH OUR LABOR FORCE OUT OF YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS PRESENTING A CASE FOR WHY YOU SHOULD KEEP THE COMMISSION THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION NBC DC? AND THE DRIVERS SEAT WITH RESPECT TO PROTECTING YOUR INTEREST IN THE TIDELANDS AND WITH RESPECT PROTECTING THE STATE'S INTEREST IN MOVING FORWARD WITH INTERNATIONAL TRADE ARE PORTENT ASPEN. pTHANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS LISA AND ALL. I AM THE CITY OF ADVOCATE. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA DISTRICT. OF THE INTERNATIONAL LONGSHORE AND WAREHOUSE ASSOCIATION -- WHICH REPRESENTS FOURTEEN LOCAL UNIONS -- FROM EUREKA TO SALINAS. WE ARE OPPOSED AB ELEVEN NINETY ONE BECAUSE THE BILL WOULD ELIMINATE THE CURRENT PUBLIC TRUST PROTECTIONS AT HOWARD TERMINAL. FOR THE ACE BALLPARK PLAN. THE PUBLIC PRESS PROTECTIONS RESERVE BORDER WAYS FOR NATURAL HABITAT PROTECTION. IN MARITIME ACTIVITIES THEY ALSO. HAS ALLOWED THE PORTABLE GOING TO BE ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL IN THE WEST COAST. OAKLAND SPORT IS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY AND SEAPORT ACTIVITY. AT THE PORTS SUPPORTS MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN TO WRECK WAGES AND SALARY PRINTERS REAL JOBS. THAT PERSON THAT SUPPORT THE LANGUAGE FOR MANY AREA RESIDENTS. OF THIS JOB TOTAL COMES TO ABOUT EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND REGION WIDE. THE EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND REGIONAL JOBS 20% OR SEVENTEEN THOUSAND OF THOSE JOBS ARE IN THE CITY OF OAKLAND. LET'S SAY THAT THE CON HOLD THE MIKE. HELLO BUT THE OKAY. HELLO THERE ALRIGHT I WON'T HOLD IT. SO THE LEGISLATION FAILS TO ADDRESS POLICIES TO MAKE TO MAINTAIN CURRENT MARITIME INDUSTRY JOBS IN THE PORT AREA. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS ABOUT PER AREA BETWEEN THE WORKING POOR IN THE PROPOSED RESIDENTIAL HOUSING. THE BILL IS ALSO LACKING REALISTIC SOLUTIONS TO FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION CONGESTION. OUR MARITIME WORKFORCE REPRESENTS SOME OF THE HIGHEST SKILLED IN HIGHLY SPECIALIZED BLUE COLLAR. LABOR IN NORTH AMERICA. WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT THE CITY OF OAKLAND IN A SPORT COMMISSIONS SEEM TO BE SEEM TO HAVE A NEW VISION OF THE PORT. THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE US THIS IS TROUBLING CONCERNING THE REDUCE PORT AREA MEANS REDUCE WORK OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MARITIME WORKING COMMUNITY. THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD NOT ENDORSE THE REMOVAL OF THE THAILAND STRESS FROM THE WATERFRONT PROPERTY WITHIN THE PORT OF OAKLAND OR ALLOW FOR THE CREATION OF A HOUSING. SLASH OFFICE SLASH STADIUM BEGINS WHEN HE'S BEEN ALONG. YOUR TIME IS UP IF YOU CAN FINISH UP WHICH IS COMPLETELY INCONSISTENT WITH THE PUBLIC TRUST ARE WORKING WATERFRONT RESPECTIVELY AS A YOU PROTECT THE PORT OF OAKLAND. IN OUR MARITIME RELATED JOBS THANK YOU. CHAIR MEMBERS I MARIN PIN IT ON BEHALF OF THE INTERNATIONAL LONGSHORE AND WAREHOUSE UNION -- ONE THING TO CONSIDER HERE IS THAT THE SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL I TALK ABOUT JOB CREATION FOR US IS A JOB ELIMINATION IN THE LONG RUN AS IT.

ANYBODY HAVE -- I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS -- MY FIRST IS FOR ANY OF THE OF THE OPPONENTS WHO WISH TO SPEAK WHICH IS IF ANYBODY KNOWS WHEN THE LAST TIME THAT THE CDC ALLOWED ANY HOUSING I'M BE FILL. AND WHAT OF THE CDC'S GOALS FOR THE REGULATION OF BAY FILL OUR AND IF THERE'S ANY OTHER PROPOSALS THAT ANYONE KNOWS ABOUT ABOUT BE FILL A PROPOSALS FOR HOUSING. THANK YOU THAT'S A THAT'S A VERY CONFERENCE A QUESTION I'M NOT SURE HAVE A CONFERENCE OF ANSWER FOR IT BUT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY IN THE SEAPORT PLAN -- THERE IS NO ACCOMMODATION FOR HOUSING -- WE'VE HAD BILLS LIKE THIS IN THE PAST WITH RESPECT TO OTHER PORTS IN THE BAY AREA -- THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ACCOMMODATIONS FOR HOUSING WITHIN THE THE BAY FILL. AND AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW -- BUT MAY NOT UNDER THE NEXT YEAR PATRICK SACK WITH SET UP THE CDC WHEN YOU BUILD ON PHIL. YOU'RE ACTUALLY STILL BUILDING IN THE BACK -- SO THAT'S WHY THE CDC WORD RETAINS JURISDICTION AND SO HOUSING IS NOT ALLOWED ON PHIL. WHETHER YOU'RE PART OF THE SEA PORT PLAN OR NOT -- SO THAT'S CERTAINLY ONE OF THE THE JURISDICTIONAL PROBLEMS MOVING FORWARD WITH THE BILL -- IS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE ABLE TO ASSERT A RIGHT TO BUILD HOUSING. ESSENTIALLY WITHIN THAT THE BAY ENVELOPE WITHIN THE BC DC JURISDICTION THAT CERTAINLY PROBLEMATIC. THANKS. AND THEN THE AUTHOR ON THE ACE OF STATED CLEARLY IN A NUMBER OF PUBLIC MEETING SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT. THEY'RE NOT TAKING STATE LEGISLATION TO CIRCUMVENT EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND THEIR NOT SEEKING -- TO AND RUN THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION OR BC DC -- AND I WANTED TO JUST -- CLARIFY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO COMMIT TODAY THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE SEEKING ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS IN THE FUTURE THAT ARE GOING TO CIRCUMVENT EITHER AT THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION OR THE B. CDC PROCESS. THAT IS CORRECT OKAY AND THAT IF THE BILL CHANGES SUBSTANTIALLY YOU'LL BE WILLING TO BRING IT BACK TO OUR COMMITTEE SO THAT WE HAVE A CHANCE TO EVALUATE ANY OF THOSE CHANGES MORE THAN HAPPY. TO THANK YOU -- I WANTED TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING THE LANGUAGE -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BILL DOES NOT LIMIT THE AUTHORITY OF THE B. C. B. C. BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES HERE AND YOU KNOW QUITE HONESTLY THE MERITS OF THE PROJECT OR NOT REALLY I THINK THE COMMITTEE'S CONCERN IT'S A LOCAL JURISDICTION BUT IT IS OUR CONCERN. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC PROCESS IS RESPECTED BUT THE PUBLIC HAS A CHANCE TO WEIGH IN ON THAT THE CDC AND STATE LANDS ALSO. HAS THEIR FULL SCOPE OF AUTHORITY -- TO EVALUATE -- THE PROJECT AND BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE BILL MAKES THAT CLEAR THAT THEY'RE NOT CIRCUMVENTING THAT AUTHORITY I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. AND I CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPONENTS -- TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS AND MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC HAS A YOU KNOW A FULL HEARING AT ALL OF THE VARIOUS ISSUES -- AND AGAIN I I THINK EVERYBODY FOR COMING TO TESTIFY IN ALL OF YOUR YOU KNOW CONSERVE YOUR COMMUNITY AND ALL OF YOUR ACTIVISM AND EVERYONE WHO LINED UP AND RODE BUSES AND HOPEFULLY TRAINS TO GET HERE TODAY SO THANK YOU.

BY PROVIDING GRANTS TO VARIOUS PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE THE TERRITORY IN EASTERN LOS ANGELES AND WESTERN ORANGE COUNTY. THE CONSERVANCY HAS IMPROVED WATERSHEDS RESTORED WILDLIFE HABITAT AND PROVIDED NUMEROUS OUTDOOR RECREATIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES.

MADAM CHAIR. HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S RICHARD HARRIMAN I'M GENERAL COUNSEL TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND MORE MENTAL DEFENSE CENTER. I'M HERE TO SPEAK JUST VERY BRIEFLY A COUPLE APPOINTMENTS OTHER PEOPLE WANT TO SPEAK. OUR POSITION IS IS THAT THIS LEGISLATION IS NOT NEEDED. THERE'S ALREADY SUFFICIENT OF PRODUCT IN THE PIPELINE -- WE VERY MUCH YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING LOCAL CONTROL OVER TAKEN -- BY THE STATE MANDATE ON THIS PARTICULAR. PROJECT. THE PROBLEM IS IN THE FINDINGS THE DATA DOESN'T SUPPORT FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. THIS PLACE TO HER GOING TO BE NEEDING THE THE NEW HOUSING OR THAT THE RESIDENTIAL. TENANCIES BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT UP 2627080% OF THE PEOPLE WILL BE GONE BEFORE THE NEW HOUSING IS ACTUALLY THROUGH. THAT'S PROVIDED BY THIS LEGISLATION. IN ADDITION BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT DOESN'T ADDRESS HUMAN OF IMPACTS BECAUSE OF THE SICK WERE. EXEMPTION THE TAXPAYERS AND RATEPAYERS AND THE SALES TAX PAYERS OF THE CITY OF CHICO IN PARTICULAR ARE GONNA BE LEFT WITH. CONTINUED DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FROM THE LEGISLATURE'S ACTION REGARDING TRANSPORTATION WHICH IS ALREADY. DETERIORATED SUFFICIENTLY THE CITY OF CHICO IS LOOKING AT DOING A BOND MEASURE SO WE HAVE THE DEEP DEEP DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE DEFICIENCIES THAT ALREADY EXISTS GETTING COMPOUNDED. IN THE MITIGATION MEASURES IN THE TAXES OR THE MITIGATION FEES ARE REQUIRED OF NEW DEVELOPMENT. WE'RE NOT INCREASE FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THROUGH LAST YEAR SO WE'RE ALREADY BEHIND THIS HIGH RATE OF GROWTH IS GOING TO HAVE THE CIVIC AND SUPERIOR SERIOUS -- IMPACTS ON THE LOCAL EXISTING RESIDENTS WHO HAVE TO PAY THE PROPERTY TAXES. IN THE FEES. THE EVENING. ELIZABETH DEVEREAUX FROM FRIENDS OF THE FOOT HILLS -- I THINK BIG CITES THE FACT THAT -- THE MINISTERIAL APPROVAL PROCESS. I SEEMS TO BE AN OVER REACH FOR LOCALLY ELECTED. REPRESENTATIVES -- THE SEQUEL APPROVAL PROCESS -- IS THERE TO PROVIDE NOT ONLY PROTECTION TO THE ENVIRONMENT BUT ALSO HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE AND TO GIVE THE PEOPLE A VOICE IN THE PLANNING PROCESS -- AND BY PASSING SECRET WOULD SET A VERY DANGEROUS PRECEDENT FOR CALIFORNIA. IN REGARDS TO STREAMLINING THE DEVELOPMENT -- WE HOUSE WAS SET A READY BUYER MAYOR THAT WE ALREADY HAVE. TEN THOUSAND HOUSING FOR TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE PIPELINE AND OF FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS OUR GENERAL PLANS OF CALL FOR NEW URBANIST HOUSING AN INFILL RATHER THAN SUBDIVISIONS. AND THIS WOULD PREVENT URBAN SPRAWL BUT IN CHICO PLANNING STAFF BECAUSE SOME OF THESE LARGE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENTS INFILL. AND THEY ARE NOT IN NEW URBANIST INFILL DEVELOPMENT. IT ALREADY HAS AN EXPENSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. AND WOULD OFFER POSSIBILITY OF EFFICIENT PUBLIC TRANSIT WALK ABILITY AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- THIS KIND OF INFILL ALSO ADDRESSES I THINK ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS WHICH IS CLIMATE CHANGE -- SOME OF THE PROJECTS THAT ARE ARE. UP. RIGHT NOW CUMULATIVE LEE WOULD ACTUALLY GIVE TWENTY THREE THOUSAND CAR TRIPS A DAY. AND CANNOT MITIGATE THEIR CARBON EMISSIONS -- SO -- FOR I THINK FOR TO WORSEN THE CLIMATE CHANGE IN AIR QUALITY THEY SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED. AND THE IRONY WOULD BE TO APPROVE THAT BILL AB FOR THIRTY AND STREAMLINE THIS PROCESS ON THE VERY KINDS. OF DEVELOPMENTS WHICH WOULD ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE. TO MORE DISASTROUS EVENTS LIKE THE CAMPFIRE.

CO AUTHORSHIP INTRODUCED AB FIFTEEN OH NINE IN RESPONSE TO A FIRE CAUSED BY A LITHIUM ION BATTERY AT THE SHORE WAY FACILITY IN SAN MATEO COUNTY. WHICH CAUSED EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGES THAT SHUT DOWN THE FACILITY FOR NINETY DAYS AND TOOK OVER A YEAR TO RESTORE. WITH OVER HALF A MILLION LITHIUM ION BATTERY SOLD LAST YEAR AND THE NUMBER OF BATTERIES ON THE MARKET EXPECTED TO DOUBLE IN THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS THE NUMBER OF LITHIUM ION BATTERIES FOUND IN THE WASTE STREAM. WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE RISK OF MORE FIRES WILL RISE ALONG WITH IT AB FIFTEEN OH NINE TREATS LOOSE BATTERIES AND BATTERIES EMBEDDED IN PRODUCTS DIFFERENTLY. AS HE ANNOUNCES POINTS OUT EXISTING LAW REQUIRES LARGE RETAILERS TO HAVE A MECHANISM TO ACCEPT ALL RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES FROM CONSUMERS RECYCLING. BATTERIES THAT ARE EMBEDDED IN DEVICES ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE LAW SO WE PROPOSED A RETAILER'S HELP IMPROVE THE COLLECTION OF PRODUCTS WITH EMBEDDED LITHIUM ION BATTERIES BY ESTABLISHING A TAKE BACK PROGRAM OUR DEPOSIT SYSTEM. OR A SIMILAR PROGRAM WERE ALLOWING FLEXIBILITY SINCE THERE IS SUCH A WIDE ARRAY OF PRODUCTS. THAT HAVE THESE BATTERIES IN THEM WHEN IT COMES TO MANUFACTURERS OF LOOSE LITHIUM ION BATTERIES WERE DEALING WITH A MUCH NARROWER GROUP OF COMPANIES. AB FIFTY NO INE CALLS FOR THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THE END OF LIFE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR PRODUCTS WITH A PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY MODEL. THIS MODEL ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THESE PRODUCTS DESPITE ALL OF THEIR PORT APPLICATIONS AND USES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT END OF LIFE CONSEQUENCE WHICH THE MANUFACTURER MUST HELP MITIGATE. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THE END OF LIFE CONSEQUENCE FOR LITHIUM ION BATTERIES AS FIRES THAT ARE PUBLICLY FINANCED SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE. AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE LIST OF SUPPORTERS ON THE BILL THIS IS A TRULY STATEWIDE MATTER I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON A. B..

I IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE HAD A CATASTROPHIC FIRE -- IN OUR RECYCLING CENTER -- WE HAVE A NUMBER OF LITHIUM ION BATTERY FIRES FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE PRESENT A VERY SERIOUS THREAT -- TO THE WORKERS AND OF COURSE TO THE FACILITY ITSELF WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE ON THAT DAY THE WAS NO ONE HURT BUT IT DID CAUSE EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF DAMAGE -- AND IN FACT IT IS -- IT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS SOME SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES AS WE HAVE LOOKED TO REPLACE THE INSURANCE IT HAS. HI IT HAS COSTS. ABOUT THREE TIMES WHAT IT DID PREVIOUS TO THE FIRE -- OR OR FORMER -- INSURANCE PROVIDER ACTUALLY FIRED US -- IN SO WE HAD TO GO IN THE MARKET PLACE AND GO SHOPPING AGAIN SO WE NOW HAVE SEVEN INSURANCE PROVIDERS PROVIDING THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY COVERAGE -- CURRENTLY WE HAVE ABOUT ELEVEN BATTERIES LITHIUM ION BATTERIES PER HOUR GOING THROUGH THE THE FACILITY EVERYONE OF THEM REPRESENTS A COMBUSTIBLE EVENT. AND IT'S QUITE. A IT'S QUITE -- A CHALLENGING FOR US TO OPERATE OUR OUR FACILITY -- THERE'S ABOUT A HUNDRED PLUS OF THESE FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND THERE'S THOUSANDS OF JOBS AT STAKE HERE AS WELL. SO WITH THAT I WANT TO URGE IN HIGH VOTE ON FIFTEEN OH NINE I GAP IN THE COLLAPSE OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE BEING MINDFUL OF THE TIME I'LL JUST SAY THAT. AS THESE BATTERIES BECOME MORE MORE POPULAR AND CHEAPER AND CHEAPER. THE FIRES AT MATERIAL RECYCLING FACILITIES HAVE BEEN GOING UP PROPORTIONALLY AT THE SAME RATE.

I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION I THINK -- WHICH IS I I THINK THIS IS A GREAT BILL AND I ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT IT -- BUT THEY NEED TO ALSO BE A WAY TO NOTIFY CONSUMERS OF WHICH PRODUCTS THEY CAN THIS BUT HOW THEY CAN DISPOSE OF DIFFERENT WAYS. SO -- MY QUESTION IS ARE YOU ANTICIPATING SOME KIND OF A FUTURE WORK OR MEMINTA THIS OR IS IT POSSIBLE NDER THE CURRENT BILL THAT THERE COULD BE REGULATIONS TO REQUIRE VERY CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONSUMERS MAYBE EVEN ON THE BOX SO THEY KNEW BEFORE THEY PURCHASED SOMETHING. THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE -- TO DISPOSE OF IT DIFFERENTLY THAN THERE USED TO OTHER PRODUCTS. WELL I WOULD CONCUR THAT THIS CAN ONLY BE EFFECTIVE IF CONSUMERS ARE FULLY AWARE WHAT'S HAPPENING SO OPEN -- TO ANYTHING ALONG THOSE LINES TO ACHIEVE THAT AND AND DON'T KNOW IF MY SPONSORS AND SUPPORTERS OF ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENT ON THAT BUT CONSUMER NOTIFICATION IS ABSOLUTELY -- UP GOING TO BE PART OF THIS HOW WE FORMULATE THAT -- IS TO BE SEEN BUT YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT TO WORK THAT ISSUE TERRIFIC. ABSOLUTELY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CONSUMERS UNDERSTAND EVEN BEFORE THEY PURCHASE SOMETHING THAT THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY -- SO THANK YOU -- WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE WITH JUST A SIMPLY AS A MANAGER MEMBERS OF THE STATUS QUO IS UNACCEPTABLE -- THIS IS A DISTRICT ISSUE BUT CLEARLY -- THERE'S A STATEWIDE CONCERN HERE AS WELL AND THINK WE NEED TO DO SOME ADDITIONAL WORK AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON THE MATTER.

MR SAN DIEGO UNDERSTAND THIS IS -- LA SPECIFIC BILL -- BUT IF EVER IN THE FUTURE YOU SEE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BROADEN THIS -- TO STATEWIDE APPROACH SO OTHER CITIES -- IF THEY'RE ABLE TO PASS BONDS OR DO THE SAME THING. I WOULD BE ABLE TO GET THIS TYPE OF STREAMLINING I'D SUPPORT THAT AS WELL SO -- NAY IT I KNOW OF HOMELESS PROBLEM IS. AFFECTING ALL OF US EVEN NOT. THOSE OF US IN RURAL AREAS SELL -- ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO BROADEN IT. WOULD BE AWESOME HI IN AGAIN I KNOW IT'S LA SPECIFIC BUT A LOT OF AREAS REALLY NEED THIS TYPE EL. TO AND THIS ONE DOES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MISTER SANTIAGO -- SO YOU SAID MEASURE HHH PASSED -- EVEN THOUGH. THERE IS NOTHING IN THAT MEASURE THAT TOLD VOTERS THAT -- IN AT SOME POINT A SEQUEL EXEMPTION WOULD BE GIVEN IS THAT CORRECT. NOTHING IN THAT MEASURE SAID IF YOU PASS THIS WE'RE GOING TO GET A SEQUEL EXEMPTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE IN ORDER TO TO FAST TRACK WHAT WHAT I THINK THERE WAS AN EXPEDIT PROCESS. RELATED TO THE MEASURE HOWEVER IT'S THE SECOND PORTION WHICH IS THE ALLOCATION OF FUNDS IF I UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY. THIS. DOES THAT [inaudible] I KNOW. THE THE THE THE PART WE'RE TRYING TO CHANGE. IS V. THE RELEASE OF THE FUNDS BECAUSE THAT'S BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE WHAT THE PROBLEM IS SO ALL THE ALL THE ON SEQUEL PROCESS EXEMPTIONS OR OR ALREADY IN PLACE AND LAW. IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. WHERE THE PROBLEM -- HAPPENS I KNOW THIS IS THIS LIKE TO CONFUSE BUT THIS IS WHY THIS IS WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR CLARIFICATION. WHERE THE PROBLEM IS IS IN THOSE ACTIVITIES RELATED -- TO THE PROJECT AND THAT INCLUDES -- THE RELEASE OF DOLLARS SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS JUST SAY. THESE PROJECTS ARE ALREADY. A SINGLE EXEMPTED. IT'S A TECHNICALITY THIS IS ME IN LAYMAN'S TERMS IT'S A TECHNICALITY THE RELEASE OF DOLLARS [inaudible] ON ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THAT. OKAY I APOLOGIZE -- BUT I AM NOT. FAMILIAR WITH WHERE IN THE BILL IT TALKS ABOUT THIS JUST BEING FOR THE RELEASE OF FUNDS IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS BILL. RELATES TO SEE QUICK SANCTION SO THAT YOU CAN GET THESE PROJECTS MOVING. AND MY INCORRECT I THINK THE AMENDMENTS WE TOOK WOOD. WHAT A LINE THOSE -- ACTIVITIES DOES THE MINISTER WERE TAKEN HOUSING. SO THE BEER GUZZLING YOUR I'M ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS THE CURRENT LANGUAGES PRETTY BROAD THE AMENDMENTS WERE ACCEPTING. IS WHAT WE WOULD BE VOTING ON OKAY SO. THE AMENDMENTS YOU ARE THESE AMENDMENTS ARE TAKING. I WILL BE TAKING HIM IN THE HOUSING COMMITTEE MA'AM -- THIS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROJECT MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT CODE AND FUNDED BY MAJOR H. H. EMERGENCY SHELTERS THIS. ONE AS PROMISED. FOR THE RELEASE OF AS WELL. IF I IF I MAY IN THE CURRENT LAW. BECAUSE BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS LEGISLATION. THE SEQUEL IS ALREADY EXEMPTED FOR MOST FOR THESE PROJECTS THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROJECT IS ALREADY EXEMPTED UNDER SYKORA. SO THE DIFFERENCES THAT SOME OTHER PARTS OF THEIR APPROVAL OF THE FUNDING IS WHERE THE SEQUEL WAS TRUE WOULD HAVE BEEN TRIGGERED. SO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE BUILDINGS WAS ALREADY SEE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> EXAMS IN THESE CASES. SENATE IS THAT HELP CLARIFY. I THINK I JUST CAN BE USED EVERYBODY. THIS IS. SO WE'RE NOT. THE END. CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH. THE AMENDMENTS BECAUSE NOW I'M CONFUSED SO I THOUGHT. IT IS A CHALLENGING SUBJECT TO IT IN AYE AYE I MUST ADMIT. I'M JUST I'M SORRY MADAM CHAIR CAN SOMEONE SHOW ME IN THE BILL WHERE IT'S JUST SINGLING OUT. THE FUNDING MECHANISM LET ME ASK THE AUTHOR WITH IF YOU'D RATHER HAVE YOUR WITNESS FOR YOU OR I CAN HAVE OUR COMMITTEE STAFFER MAKE I'M JUST SORT OF EXPLAIN AND WALK THEM THROUGH THE A MEMO EVER. EVER WHATEVER YOUR COME MOST COMFORTABLE WITH -- SINCE I'M TAKING A MOMENT YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME TO PRESENT THEM. SURE LARGE LENGLEN WITH THE COMMITTEE -- SO THE THE AMENDMENTS NARROW THE SCOPE OF THE BILL AND FRANCE TO SUPPORT OF HOUSING PROJECTS THAT ARE FUNDED BY THE LOCAL BOND MEASURE HHH. AND EMERGENCY SHELTERS THAT ARE FUNDED BY THE THE STATE FUNDED HE PROGRAM BOTH WITHIN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WHICH HAS THIS VOTER APPROVED -- PROPERTY TAX OF TO TO FUND THE PROJECTS. THE THE THE POINT THAT THE AUTHOR WAS TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT. WHILE EXISTING LAW. EXEMPTS FROM C. QUIRK OR CREATES A BY RIGHT APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF THE THE PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT. THEY'RE MAKING DECISIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE THE THE CONSTRUCTION OF THESE PROJECTS AT LARGE ADOPTING ORDINANCES. FINANCING MAYBE LAND TRANSFERS AND THOSE THOSE ARE NOT NECESSARILY CAPTURED BY. THE EXEMPTION THAT WAS ENACTED LAST YEAR SOME OF THE PRIOR EXEMPTION SO THEY'RE THEY'RE TRYING TO BASICALLY COVER THEIR BASES SO THAT. THE THE FUNDING THAT THE VOTERS APPROVED CAN. YOU KNOW BE USED TO DEVELOP THESE PROJECTS -- WHETHER IT'S APPROVAL OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROJECT -- APPROVAL OF FINANCING OR LAND TRANSFER MAYBE ADOPTION OF AN ORDINANCE. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THIS IS WHAT WE SPEND SOMETIME WITH THE BILL IT'S VERY TECHNICAL I THINK THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO JUST SORT OF IT'S ALMOST LIKE I WAS IT IS SORT OF LIKE TECHNICAL CLEANUPS OF THINGS THAT JUST WEREN'T ANTICIPATED IN. SOME OF THE PASSED STREAMLINING BILLS THAT WERE DONE AS THEY'RE TRYING TO ENACT -- THE FUNDING THAT THE VOTERS YOU KNOW HAVE VOTED ON IN LOS ANGELES IN YOUR PEOPLE VOTED ON THIS ANTICIPATING THAT THESE PRODUCTS WILL GET BUILT. AND THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE SORT OF ADMINISTRATIVE KIND OF HANG UPS IN THE PROCESS. OF ENACTING THE CLEAR WILL OF THE VOTERS OF LOS ANGELES RIGHT AND AND I GET THAT I GUESS I'M -- AND I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THIS IDEA AND JUST WHEN WE GO BACK IN TIME TO THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE GO THROUGH AND PICK SOMETHING OR PROVE SOMETHING. THAT THE VOTERS THOUGHT IN LOS ANGELES AND IT WAS ALREADY APPROVED I THINK THAT'S A BACKWARDS WAY OF DOING THINGS WHICH IS WHAT SEEMS LIKE WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE. THOUGH I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE IDEA I JUST WE HAD A NUMBER OF BILLS COME THROUGH RELATED TO SEEK WAY EXEMPTIONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT PER HOUSING THAT HAVE NOT BEEN -- APPROVED -- THAT HAVEN'T BEEN DISTRICTS SPECIFIC BUT I GUESS I DON'T WANT TO SEE A PATTERN OF GOING BACK IN TIME AND SORT OF TRYING TO FIX THINGS BECAUSE A PARTICULAR. CITY OF ONE AT A LARGE CITY LOS ANGELES WHICH HAS A NUMBER MEMBERS -- GETS TO GO BACK IN TIME AND CHANGE THE BILL BUT WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION APPRECIATE THINK WE'LL UNDERSTAND THAT OF WE DON'T SORRY -- BUT BUT I DO. THANK YOU SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY SO IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THIS IS AN EXEMPTION PER SE BUT THIS IS A CURRENT LAW AND WE ARE CLEAR FINE. AT TO NARROWLY ADAPT TO THIS. CURRENT LAW FOR THIS BILL IS. MATT MATT MATT THAT'S NOT LEAST MISTER SANTIAGO AFTER. CURRENT LAW WHEN THIS WAS WITHIN THIS WAS PASSED. WAS THAT IT WOULD BE SEAT BECAUSE STREAMLINING -- INVOLVED. THAT WAS BASED ON A BILL -- MY MEMORY. RECOLLECTS THAT THE TWO MEMBERS NOW SIR IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE MEMBERS ACTUALLY -- WITH DISCUSSES WHO BELIEVE DID IT HI. I BELIEVE IS -- AB SEVENTY THREE IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN BUT I THINK WE CAN CLEAR THAT UP FOR YOU THIS PASSES. SO GET VOTERS THOUGHT THAT WE CAN GET THIS DONE NOW THERE'S THIS OTHER ITEM THAT POPS UP WHICH IS THOSE ACTIVITIES RELATED -- TO DEVELOPING -- WE COULD STREAMLINING THOSE ACTIVITIES RELATED TO IT. MEDIAN TRANSFER OF LAND TRANSFER MONEY TO CHATTER WEREN'T WERE SOMEHOW NOT IN THERE SO WE'RE LOOKING AT SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY -- COMPLETE SO WE'RE COMING BACK AND SAYING SINCE THIS LAST PIECE WAS NOT INCLUDED. LET'S JUST INCLUDE IT MEANING THESE ACTIVITIES. SUCH AS THE ONES STATED TRANSFER PROPERTY TRANSFER DOLLARS THE REAL STATE. SO THE IT'S ALREADY SEQUEL STREAMLINED. SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES. MAY NOT BE EVEN THOUGH THE TECHNICAL TRANSACTIONS IS I WOULD AS I WAS EXPLAINING MAKES SENSE. SO. OKAY SO JUST TO YOU KNOW TRY TO TAKE ANOTHER WHACK A CLARIFYING THIS LITTLE IT DOES EXPAND. THE SEQUESTERING LINING FROM THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION OF A PROJECT NOW TO THE ADOPTION OF THE ORDINANCE OR TO THE FINANCING AS WELL. SO IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE SCOPE IN TERMS OF AN ACTUAL. HOUSING PROJECT WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT A PARTICULAR HOUSING PROJECT WHERE UNDER CURRENT LAW THE HOUSING PROJECT ITSELF THE CONSTRUCTION. HAS A SICK WAS STREAMLINING. BUT THE ORDINANCE THAT WOULD CREATE. THAT HOUSING PROJECT MAY NOT UNDER CURRENT LAW SO THEY WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT IT WOULD ALSO HAVE IT. AND THE FINANCING PART FOR THAT SAME EXACT PROJECT THE PROJECT WE KNOW THE BUILDING OF THE PROJECT HAS A SECRET STREAMLINING BUT THE CREATION OF AN ORDINANCE. TO CREATE THAT PROJECT OR THE FINANCING TO FINANCE A PROJECT MIGHT NOT HAVE THE SAME SEEK WAS STREAMLINING SO I THINK SO CITY UP TO MY UNDERSTANDING AND PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG IS CITY OF LOS SANTOS WANTS TO MAKE CLEAR. THEY WANT TO EXPAND IT SO THAT THAT'S ALSO HAS THIS WEEK WAS STREAMLINING. THE WE KNOW THE BUILDING THE-CONSTRUCTION OF THE BUILDING ALREADY HAS IT I THINK THAT THIS DOESN'T CHANGE THAT BUT IT DOES EXPAND THAT SHE WAS STREAMLINING NOW TO THE PASSING OF AN ORDINANCE. OR TO THE FINANCING OF THE PROJECT. DOES THAT HELP IT IS NOT IS THAT YOUR CREW UNDERSTANDING TO I DON'T WANT IN THE WORD AND I AM SURE AND I THINK YOU DID A GOOD JOB OF DIFFEENTIATING BETWEEN THE BUILDING OF A AND AND THE LEAD LEG GALA THE OF THOSE PROCESSES SITE PATIENTS STARTED THERE. BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT DOES NOT USE. FOR LOS ANGELES. WE GET CHALLENGED WHEN WE IMPLEMENT THESE PROJECTS ESPECIALLY WITH THE EDICT THAT THE BEAR HAS ISSUED THE CHALLENGE COUNCIL MEMBERS AT ALL FIFTEEN PARTS. A DISTRICTS WITHIN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES TO IDENTIFY PARCELS A FOR THE SITES AND SO ANYTHING THAT ADDS THE CLARITY WITH RESPECT TO THE PLANNING IN THE FINANCING OF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WELCOME BECAUSE THERE WAS ALREADY STE -- STATUTES ON THE BOOKS THAT PROVIDED EXPEDITED PROCESS UNDER SYKORA FOR DIRECTING THESE TEMPORARY HOMELESS SHELTERS AND OF COURSE -- SOCIAL TO THAT WE GOT VOTER APPROVAL FOR LARGER FUSION OF FUNDING AND YOU KNOW AS I STATED EARLIER ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY CONSTITUENTS -- THEY'VE TAX THEMSELVES AND SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS AND WHEN THEY DRIVE TO AND FROM WORK THEY STILL SEE PEOPLE SEE SLEEPING ON THE STREETS. AND SO WE ARE TRYING TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE PROMISE MADE MAKE IT EASIER -- FOR LOCAL OFFICIALS IN THEIR OWN DISTRICTS IN THE CITY WRIT LARGE. TO KIND OF HANDLE COMMUNITY CHALLENGES TO COME FORWARD BUT STILL BE RESPONSIVE AND GET THE PROJECTS BUILT SO PEOPLE CAN GET OFF THE STREETS. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? OTHER THAN TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR WORK ON ON ON THIS BILL IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF I REALLY APPRECIATE IT AND TO HELP IN ESTA. STREET. FORMALLY STREAMLINED THIS US OR SPEAK AND MAKE SURE THEY TO TWO DOLLARS WORK IN AND THAT THEY HE DOLLARS OF THIS LEGISLATURE I SENT BACK TO OUR COMMUNITIES WILL BE IMPLEMENTED WE CAN GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREET.

WHAT'S SAD I WAS TOO YOU WILL HOW BUT THE NATIONAL STEWARDSHIP ACTION COUNCIL. AND SO -- SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL AND THE WE'RE HOW HONORABLE. I'M SORRY -- SAID CONSERVE -- TO TESTIFY THE THE THE TODAY. WHICH IT WILL HAVE CHIU JASON IS SH MISTER LESSER. ON BEHALF OF NATIONAL STILL URGE TO WORSHIP ACTION COUNCIL AND GREAT CAMPBELL ON BEHALF OF THE INTERFACE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AT JASON ABOUT THE HER BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS YOU'RE TO COUNCIL IN THE NATIONAL STORAGE ACTION COUNCIL STRONG SUPPORT THE BILL -- KEEP YOUR PROGRAMS -- WE TALK ABOUT THESE FOR A FEW YEARS THIS IS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL EARLY EPR PROGRAMS-THAT WAS PASSED AND WE'VE HAD SOME STRUGGLES GETTING IT IMPLEMENTED -- AND GETTING COMPLAINTS FROM THE MANUFACTURERS -- THIS BILL NOTABLY DOES TWO THINGS AND I WANT TO SPEAK TO WHAT THE OPPOSITION PUT THEIR LETTERS REALLY QUICKLY -- ONE ON THE BRIDGE PLANET ESSENTIALLY CREATES A MECHANISM IN LAW WHICH DOES NOT EXIST RIGHT NOW FOUR IF A STEWARDSHIP PLAN I WERE TO BE DISAPPROVED OR GO TO FONG THEY WOULD BE IN POSSESSION OF CALIFORNIA FEE PAYER MONEY. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT SAYS HEY YOU NEED TO HAVE AN ESCROW ACCOUNT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT MONEY FLOWS TO THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH IT WAS INTENDED? AND AND IS SAFE NOW WE'VE TALKED TO THE OPPOSITION WE'VE TALKED TO COVER CYCLE A LOT OF THIS FLOWS FROM TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS THAT WE RECEIVED FROM THEM -- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE COULD BE SOME HICK UPS AS FAR AS THE ONE YEAR -- THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT GOES AND OF TIME OVER WHICH THAT WOULD GO AND AND SPEAKING UP FOR MY CLINTS WERE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK OUT THOSE DETAILS THIS ISN'T ABOUT -- A GOTCHA OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT'S ABOUT PROTECTING CALIFORNIA FEE PAYER MONEY -- SECONDARILY -- THE LANGUAGE TO ADJUST THE PENALTIES SLIGHTLY -- IT GETS RID OF A THOUSAND DOLLAR LEVEL PENALTY AND CREATES A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR LEVEL PENALTY -- AND ALSO GETS RID OF THE LANGUAGE -- ABOUT WILL FULL -- BUT NEGLIGENT ETCETERA -- I DO WANNA MAKE A QUICK NOTE THEY SAY I BELIEVE IN THEIR LETTER THAT THIS THERE'S NO OTHER IF YOUR PROGRAM WITH THIS PENALTY LEVEL. SB -- TWO ONE TWO LAST YEAR JACKSON TING AND GRAY -- ON PHARMACEUTICALS HAS A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR BASE PENALTY LEVEL -- AND A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR PENALTY LEVEL FOR WILL FULL NEGLIGENT -- IT CETERA THAT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR PENALTY LEVEL IS NOT HERE THIS AMENDMENT -- IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LAST YOUR BILL THAT WAS DONE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE HAS ONE ECHO AND POINT THAT OUT. AND THE REASON THAT WE'RE HERE VERY QUICKLY. WE'VE GOT MULTIPLE YEARS OF NON COMPLIANCE BY THE MANUFACTURERS WE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE TRYING THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES -- BUT THE PROGRAM NEEDS TO BE WHIPPED INTO SHAPE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CALIFORNIA THE PAIR MONEY THAT WE ARE COLLECTING IS BEING USED FOR ITS INTENDED PURPOSE AND WITH THAT I STRONGLY SUPPORT URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- DRAKE CAMPBELL AND I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING INTERFACE. INTERFACE IS A WORLDWIDE -- COMMERCIAL FLOORING COMPANY AND ALSO ONE OF THE LARGEST CARPET RECYCLERS AND UNITED STATES. INTERFACE HAS ALSO BEEN AN INDUSTRY MEMBER OF THE STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL -- CARE -- SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN. TWENTY TEN WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO ENCOURAGING BEST PRACTICES IN RECYCLING ACROSS OUR INDUSTRY AND LIKE OTHERS. INCLUDING CAL RECYCLE NUMEROUS TIMES WE HAVE CONCERNS OF THE CURRENT DIRECTION OF CARE IS NOT RESULTING IN CONTINUOUS MEETING FOR TREATMENT TOWARDS OUR CARPET RECYCLING GOALS IN CALIFORNIA. AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE THINK THAT AB SEVENTY NINE AS NECESSARY WE THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRING IT FORWARD AND ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL PLEASE COME TO THE MICROPHONE. GOOD EVENING MY CLUB IS CALIFORNIANS WASTE AND STRONG SUPPORT AND COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR HIS WORK ON THIS OVER THE YEARS THANK YOU. KILLER ROBINSON ON BEHALF OF RETHINK WASTE AND SUPPORT. LOOK AT US HERE ON OUR BEHALF IS ALWAYS ASSOCIATION OF NORTH AMERICA AND SUPPORT. LOWER FRONT AND HELP THE CALIFORNIA REFUSE RECYCLING COUNCIL IN SUPPORT. ANYONE WISHING TESTIFIED OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RAINY POLLOCK ON BEHALF OF THE CARPET AND RUG INSTITUTE OUR MEMBER COMPANIES ARE PART OF THE STORE TO PLAN CALLED CARE. I JUST LIKE MAKE ONE CORRECTION THERE IS CURRENTLY AN APPROVED PLAN THAT CARE IS OPERATING UNDER AND THAT WAS APPROVED EARLIER THIS YEAR BY CAL RECYCLE I THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO MEET BY SEPTEMBER FIRST AND WE HAVE A RECYCLING RATE OF 24% OR CARE. DOES BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. I AGREE WITH THE WITH THE SOMEONE AND THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A CONTINUATION OR BRIDGE PLAN OUR CONCERN WHICH WAS REYES -- BY JASON IS PUTTING THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS INTO AN ESCROW OR TRUST ACCOUNT AND OUR QUESTION IS WHERE DOES THAT MONEY COME FROM. THE MONEY THAT IS CURRENTLY IN THE CARE ACCOUNT IS GOING TO BE SPENT DOWN WHATEVER SURPLUS WE HAVE IT IS PART OF THE PLAN. THAT IS GOING TO USE FOR SUBSIDIES IT'S GONNA BE USED FOR GRANTS. IN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH CAL RECYCLE THEY WANTED TO HAVE A TWO MONTH RESERVE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BE SPENDING DOWN THE SURPLUS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW SO WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT AN ADDITIONAL FEE AND CONSUMERS. TO CREATE ANOTHER THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR ACCOUNT IS WARRANTED -- THIS ASSESSMENT AND CARBON HAS BEEN INCREASED GETTING BACK IN TWENTY ELEVEN FROM FIVE CENTS IT WAS JUST INCREASED -- NOW IT'S AT THIRTY FIVE CENTS THE LATEST INCREASE IN JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. THE SECOND PART OF THE BILL THAT WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IS ABOUT THE FINES HE USED TO BE THAT IF YOU WERE FIND UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THERE HAD TO BE A STANDARD OF CONDUCT THAT HAD BE SHOWN. YOU HAD TO BE SHOWN THAT YOU'RE NEGLIGENT THERE'S INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT OR KNOWING THIS CONDUCT WE BELIEVE THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE WHEN YOU APPARATUS THE STEWARDSHIP PLAN YOU DON'T HAVE ANY DIRECT CONTROL YOU'RE WORKING WITH PROCESSORS TO WORKING WITH RECYCLERS YOU'RE WORKING WITH -- COLLECTORS AND MANUFACTURES. YOU'RE WORKING WITH THEM AND YOU'RE GETTING AGREEMENTS WITH THEM SAYING THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE PROMISING TO DO CERTAIN THINGS BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS WHAT WE SEEN AS WE MAY HAVE AN EQUIPMENT FAILURE SOME OP PROCESS OR MAY HAVE AN EQUIPMENT FAILURE. WE HAD ONE COMPANY THIS YEAR THAT SAID THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE THIRTY MILLION POUNDS OF CARPET. AND THEN THE COMPANY WAS SOLD AND SO THAT FACILITY IS NO LONGER RECYCLING CARPET THAT'S SOMETHING BEYOND OUR CONTROL SO WE BELIEVE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE A STANDARD OF CONDUCT WHERE TO MINISTER TO LECTURE. JUDGE CAN LOOK TO SEE WHERE YOU NEGLIGENT IN YOUR DUTIES. IN YOUR DUTIES WERE YOU INTENTIONALLY WRONGFUL IN THE WAY YOU CONDUCTED YOUR BUSINESS SO WE BELIEVE THAT THAT IT'S VERY ARBITRARY -- WE THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE REINSTATED AND IF GORDON MISTER SMELTER THAT YOU KNOW WE IN THE WEST OR CHIP PLAN THAT THEY HAVE -- THAT STANDARD THEY REMOVE THAT STANDARD BUT I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY I THINK IT'S PROBABLY A HUNDRED TIMES BIGGER THAN THE CARPET INDUSTRY. AND SO THE NUMBERS THAT ARE IN THAT BILL I DON'T THINK COULD BE APPLICABLE TO HEAR FINALLY I'D LIKE TO CONCLUDE IS THAT OVER THE LAST -- DURING THE MOUNT OF THIS PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE GIVEN AWAY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN SUBSIDIES AND WHILE THE CARPET RATE CONTINUES TO INCREASE WE HAVE SEEN THE DIFFICULTIES OF LIKE CAL RECYCLING TRYING TO MEET THE OVERALL RECYCLING RATE OF THE STATE WHICH IS. SUPPOSED TO BE 75% AT THE END OF THIS YEAR. THEY STARTED A 52% SEVERAL YEARS AGO THERE AT 42% RIGHT NOW AND THE CLIENT SO THAT SHOWS YOU THAT CREATING AN INTRICATE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA IS VERY DIFFICULT. BUT WE BELIEVE CALIFORNIA WILL MEET ITS GOALS ON CARPET AND WE CONTINUE TO THINK WILL CONTINUE TO THRIVE BECAUSE WE ARE THE FIRST IN THE NATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I GREW UP IN HERE ON BEHALF OF MOHAWK INDUSTRIES -- AND AND WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL -- I I REITERATE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT -- MISTER POLLOCK SAID INTEREST IN THE THE UNPRECEDENTED NATURE OF THE OF THE OF THE MASSIVE FINES -- FOR IN TAKING OUT THE KNOWING IN NEGLIGENT -- STANDARD -- ONE THING I WANT TO POINT OUT AND I GUESS I REALLY WANT TO SAY THIS. ISN'T SOMETHING THAT THE AUTHOR. HAD INDICATED AS HE WAS CLOSING -- AND THAT HE WAS THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND I I REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON THAT -- WERE OPPOSED TO THE WORK IN PROGRESS WE WE WE WOULD WE WOULD PREFER THIS COMMITTEE JUST VOTE ON A BILL TO SAY HEY THIS IS THE BILL AND THIS IS THE BILL OR VOTING ON AND AND AND AS AS AMENDED REST PROPOSED TO BE IN AND FOR THAT MATTER. WE WOULD REALLY STRENUOUSLY OPPOSE A WORK IN PROGRESS BECAUSE TWO YEARS AGO THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS ROLLED THROUGH HERE WITH AB ELEVEN FIFTY EIGHT AND IT WAS A IT WAS A REALLY A NOTHING BILL AND WE WEREN'T OPPOSED TO IT WENT OVER THE SENATE. AND THE SENATE. SUBSTANTIVELY CHANGED IT CAME BACK TO THIS SITE IN AUGUST AND AND AND THIS SITE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO JUST HAVE A HEARING ON IT AND JUST. LET US VENT TO AND THEN PUT IT ON THE FLOOR SO IT WE THINK HE THE ASSEMBLY NATURI SOURCES COMING. HASN'T IT THE THE THE THE THE SPONSORING AUTHOR HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO THE COMMITTEE TO ACTUALLY VOTE ON A BILL HERE. AND ACTUALLY ALLOW THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS IN THE IN THE IN THE FOLKS ON THIS COMMITTEE ACTUALLY CRAFT THAT BILL RATHER THAN LET THE SENATE DO IT FOR YOU SO. SO WE WE WE ASK YOU TO TO YOUR TO DECIDE YOU KNOW THE THERE'S SOME THERE'S SOME THERE'S NOTHING IN THE AUTHOR STATEMENT I'M IN THE OFFICE FACT SHEET THAT INDICATES THE NEED FOR A A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR NO NEGLIGENCE FINE. THERE'S NOTHING -- YOU KNOW DOCTORS FACTUALLY TALKS ABOUT THE NEED FOR A BRIDGE PLAN WERE FINE WITH THE BRIDGE PLAN -- BUT BUT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE NOT FINE WITH HAVING A YEARS WORTH OF MONEY TIED UP IN IT THAT THAT THAT'S NOT GONNA HELP THE THE RECYCLING PROGRAM AND FINALLY -- JUST. IF WE WANT CARPET RECYCLING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WORK. DON'T LET THAT LET THE STORAGE OF ORGANIZATION DO THEIR JOB RATHER KEEP COMING BACK HERE WITH LEGISLATION IF IF IF THIS WAS NEEDED IF ANY OF THIS OR ANYTHING. THAT THAT THE IS PLANNED BY THE SPONSOR IS NEEDED IT COULD'VE BEEN DEALT WITH IN AB ELEVEN FIFTY EIGHT THEY JUST WROTE THE THEY WROTE THAT BILL. IT'S ONLY BEEN IT'S ONLY BEEN IN IMPLEMENTED FOR A YEAR IT WAS PASSED TWO YEARS AGO TOOK A YEAR TO IMPLEMENTED IN OUR BACK HERE WITH ANOTHER BILL. JUST KIND OF JUST MAKING IT HARDER FOR THE ORGANIZATION TO DO THE JOB THAT YOU GUYS PASSED THEM TO DO SO WE ASK FOR YOU TO HEAR NO VOTE OR AT LEAST. VOTE ON A BILL THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE AGAIN THAT THAT WILL BE THE SAME BILL. OKAY. THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. OKAY SING NUMBER GO BACK TO THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] THIS GARCIA. THANK YOU I KNOW MR CHU HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS -- FOR MORE THAN JUST THIS YEAR -- AND SO DO I DO APPRECIATE THAT AND SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP -- WITH WITH THIS PROGRAM -- ARE HELPING TO GET SOME OF THE DECISIONS FOR MAKING ON OUR MATTRESS -- PROGRAM AS WELL BUT I I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AND SOME CONCERNS AS YOU'RE WORKING ON ON THIS IN THE FIRST ONE IS TIED TO THE ONE YEAR'S WORTH OF REVENUE THAT'S BEING SET ASIDE. AND AND KIND OF THE RATIONALE OR THE NEED FOR THAT CAN AND IT'S PART OF WHAT THE OPPOSITION SPOKE TO CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT. WELL THIS IS THE VIEW THAT WE COLLECTED FROM THE CONSUMER. SO WE ASKED HIM TO DEPOSIT INTO THE ESCROW ACCOUNT. THANK YOU YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD TO THAT. YEAH LISTEN THE THE LANGUAGE THAT WE GOT THE ONE YEAR -- WAS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM POWER CYCLE I THINK. THE IDEA IS WE WANT TO TALK TO THE OPPOSITION AND SAY WHAT WHAT MAKES SENSE PART WE HAVE TO REMEMBER AN EPR PROCESSES. IF THEY DISAPPROVE CARES PLAN AND THEY GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF DOING ANOTHER PLAN THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TIME LINES THAT ARE IN THE BILL THERE'S GOING TO BE NINETY DAYS TO SUBMIT A PLAN THERE'S GONNA BE A PERIOD TO REVIEW THE PLAN. SO IT COULD TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS TO A YEAR -- TO GET THE NEXT PLAN IN PLACE AND MOVING SO I THINK I CAN'T SPEAK FOR POWER CYCLE OF OBVIOUSLY NOT THAT -- BUT I THINK THE IDEA WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS ENOUGH MONEY TO CONTINUE THE ACTIVITIES OF THE OF THE RISK FOR CYCLING PROGRAM SO THAT THE RECYCLERS DIDN'T GO DEFUNCT. WHILE THE STATE WAS KIND OF FIGURING OUT ITS BUSINESS WITH THE PROGRAM SIGN AND A LITTLE BIT OF THE TIME AND YOU GAVE ME AND I WILL CONCEDE THAT YOU CAN GIVE ME THE FULL DESCRIPTION IT WAS A LOT LESS THAN A YEAR THAT YOU GOT TO SUBSCRIBE TO ME. THOUGH FOR THAT PROCESS IN THE IN THE APPEALS. ON AND SO MAYBE CAN I HEAR FROM YOU GUYS ABOUT THE ONE YEAR. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN GARCIA. WITH THE PLAN EVEN IF THE PLAN IS NOT IN PLACE THE MONEY WILL STILL KEEP FALLING INTO CALIFORNIA YOU CANNOT SELL CARPET IN CALIFORNIA. UNLESS YOU PAY AN ASSESSMENT SO THAT MONEY WILL CONTINUE TO FLOW IN THE CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT GOING TO STOP SO THERE WILL BE A FINE SET UP WITH THE MONEY CONTINUES TO COME IN TO OPERATE THE PROGRAM. THAT'S WHY WE OPERATE TODAY WERE OPERATING AT THE MONEY COMES IN WE'RE SPENDING IT ON THE PROGRAM SO THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE. SO IS THERE A SHORTER TIME LINE THAT YOU WOULD BE. ABLE TO DO IT WHAT WE'RE SAYING THE MONEY IS ALREADY GOING TO BE THERE WHY DO WE NEED TO TRY STERN ESCROW UNTIL. NO TIMELINE YEAH WELL I THINK I THINK IT WOULD REALLY TRY TO SAY IS THERE THE IF WE HAVE TO BUILD INTO A SOME SOMETHING IN WRITING THAT SAYS YOU KNOW. WHAT A DIRT THERE WILL BE A A TRANSITION MECHANISM TO GO FROM ONE STORE SHIP ORGANIZATION TO ANOTHER WE'RE FINE WITH THAT THE THE THE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY? THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S GOING TO BE SITTING THERE IS GOING TO BE THIS WOULD BE THE SAME NO MATTER WHAT WHETHER IF IF CARE STILL EXISTS AFTER SEPTEMBER SECOND. NOT NOTHING CHANGES CHARACTERS GOES FORWARD THEY THEY DON'T NECESSARILY THEY WON'T NECESSARILY NEED A BIGGER RESERVE AND ANY NEW STORESHIP ORGANIZATION ISN'T GONNA NECESSARILY NEED A BIGGER RESERVE. AND AND JUST AS A MATTER OF EQUITY NO CHARACTER STARTED THEIR STASHED STARSHIP ORGANIZATION FROM SCRATCH NOBODY KNOWS. NOBODY -- NOBODY FOR PRE FUNDED THEM IN SAID HEY GET GET ROLLING I MEAN THEY STARTED FROM SCRATCH AND AND YOU KNOW AND IT'S HARD AND THEY'RE THEY'RE WORKING NOT THEY'RE WORKING ON YOU KNOW FINING AND MARKETS. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS MONEY YOUR RIGHT IT'S KATE CALM AND AND WE JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT INTO A TRUST ACCOUNT. JACKSON YOU HAVE. BUT I THINK THE PROBLEM --FROM THAT JUST A BUREAUCRATIC PERSPECTIVE IS THAT THERE'S NOTHING IN THE CURRENT LAW THAT SAYS WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MONEY THAT INTO THE IN THE POSSESSION OF A STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATION IF IT IS NO LONGER APPROVED BY CARMICHAEL. THERE'S NOTHING HAT SAYS WHAT HAPPENS TO THE CALIFORNIA FEW MONEY IF IT'S IN AN ACCOUNT IN GEORGIA IT JUST IT DOESN'T SPEAK TO IT. WHICH WHICH IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT'S PART OF THE INTENT OF THE BILL TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENS THERE -- AND WE'RE GOOD WITH THAT. YEAH. AND SO I MEAN IN THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME COMMON GROUND AT LEAST ON ON THAT PART OF THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE. THE DOLLAR AMOUNT WHETHER IT'S A WHOLE YEAR'S WORTH OF PERCENT ESTIMATE THAT IS WHERE WE HAVE A DISCONNECT THEM. I WOULD HOPE YOU GUYS KIND OF COMING DOWN ON THAT WHERE YOU MIGHT NOT BE HAPPY BUT IT'S SOMETHING MAYBE A LITTLE LESS HERE THAN WHAT THEY'RE ASKING. FOR AND SO I KNOW RIGHT NOW YOU KIND OF TELL ME NO BUT I HOPE YOU MOVE CLOSER THAT DIRECTION AND AND THERE'S A SPACE BECAUSE BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH WORK AND THERE IS A BOOM IS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN HERE. ALONG THE WAY. AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION OF MY FINAL QUESTION IS ABOUT THE INTENTIONAL NEGLIGENT NEGLIGENCE AND WE ARE REMOVING THAT. IN THIS BILL. IN FOR FOR THE SPONSOR AND THE DOCTOR EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT TO HELP US DO A BETTER JOB AND RECYCLING. MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE NEGLIGENCE JUST VERY DIFFICULT TO PROVE. SO THAT THAT'S WHY WERE CUT WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER AND PRETTY MUCH GIVE THE THE THE THE LAW JUDGES OF MORE DISCRETION ON HOW MUCH -- THEY FIND A ONE OR TWO IN -- IMPOSE ON ON A DAILY BASIS. SO IN THE EXISTING BILL THERE IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT NOW JUST AT A LOWER LEVEL THERE IS AN EXISTING ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR PENALTY THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT THE MAVS BACK ON INTENTIONAL KNOWING OR NEGLIGENT SO THE STANDARD IS. IN CURRENT LAW RIGHT NOW AND IT IS IN CURRENT LAW AND SB TWO ONE TWO FOR PHARMACEUTICALS AT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS I THINK. THE REASON THAT WE'RE HERE AND I'M NOT HERE TO KEEP ANYBODY OUT BUT WE'VE BEEN IN THIS ENDLESS ENFORCEMENT LOOP WITH THE INDUSTRY 201-320-1420. FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN PLAN WERE THE PLAN THAT'S IN THE PLACE RIGHT NOW IS ON A CONTINGENCY BASIS. IN SEPTEMBER COVER CYCLES GOING TO TRY TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE DONE THEIR JOB AS DESCRIBED IN THE PLAN IF THEY DON'T. WE'RE GONNA BE IN THIS POSITION WHERE WE'RE GONNA BE EITHER DISAPPROVING A PLANNER REPEALING A PLAN AND YOUR EARLIER POINT. I THINK I OBVIOUSLY CAN'T SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT I THINK THERE'S A DESIRE FOR MORE TEETH IN THE ENFORCEMENT. MECHANISM THAT'S IN CURRENT LAW. BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN ALL ADMIT THAT THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM THAT'S IN CURRENT LAW RIGHT NOW IS NOT WORKING BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN IN THIS AND LET'S ENFORCEMENT LIVE. FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS. SO IF I'M INTERPRETING CORRECTLY YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT BY REMOVING THIS OR CHANGING THIS LANGUAGE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE BETTER ENFORCEMENT. BUT IT'S STILL GOING TO BE THE LEGAL PROCESS NONETHELESS AND IS STILL RIGHT. YES CORRECT THE MET AND THAT'S MY MY INTERPRETATION OF THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WE RECEIVE YES. HI I JUST SAID TO ME WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE THAT IF YOU MISS ONE DEADLINE YOU COULD BE FINED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY. YOU CAN MISS AN ANNUAL REPORT BE FINED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY THE WAY IT'S SET UP RIGHT NOW AND AS CHASIN INDICATED. YES -- IS NOT REALLY YEARS WE HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE WITH A FINE HE'S LOOK AT ALL THE INFORMATION AND HE DETERMINED THAT WE WERE NOT NEGLIGENT. BECAUSE HE REALIZED THAT WE HAVE THEIR CONTRACT WITH THIRD PARTY TO KNOW TO DO CERTAIN THINGS. SO IN HIS RULINGS HE HAS FOUND THAT WE WERE NOT NEGLIGENT OR THERE IS NO INTENTION MISCONDUCT WHICH WE BELIEVE IS VERY IMPORTANT. IF YOU'RE GONNA YOU KNOW WE HAVE LOTS OF PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA CAL RECYCLE ARE WE ALL GOING TO HOLD EACH OTHER TO THAT SAME STANDARD. BECAUSE VERY HARD TO DO THAT WHEN YOU'RE RELYING UPON THIRD PARTIES -- I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR FOR THE BILL TODAY I I DO YOU. HAVEN'T HAD STATIONS ABOUT. REMOVE INTENTIONAL NEGLIGENCE. THERE'S TIME FOR SALE WE SHE LITTLE BETTER WE SHOULD BE DOING IT BETTER BUT WE STILL SCREW UP I JUST GOT A LETTER ABOUT SOMETHING I TURNED IN TWO DAYS LATE AND AM I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT AND MY FIRST GUT REACTION US LIKE I SHOULD KNOW BETTER. BUT THEN THEY WERE LIKE YOU ACTUALLY WERE WAITING FOR LEGAL -- OPINION AND THAT'S WHY I TOOK HE TOOK TWO DAYS AND SO CYCLE OKAY WELL THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF AND STILL GETTING TING. RIGHT AN SO. IT JUST REMINDS YOU OF WHY INTENTIONAL NEGLIGENCE AND SOMETHING THAT I DO THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT HELLO FOR THE BILL TODAY I DON'T KNOW IF. AS THIS BILL MOVES WITH THAT PIECE I'M GOING TO BE OKAY WITH THAT DOWN THE ROAD [inaudible] THANK YOU. AND JUST TO BE CLEAR THE FINE IS UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT HAS TO BE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO IT DOES GIVE -- OF FLEXIBILITY TO LOOK AT EACH PARTICULAR INSTANCE AND TO SAY. IS IT SOMETHING THAT'S AGREE JUST ARE NOT IS IT SOMETHING THAT REALLY WARRANTS THAT KIND OF FINE OR WAS THERE SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED THAT WAS OUT OF THEIR CONTROL SO THERE CAN CERTAINLY BE A LOT OF DISCRETION -- THAT'S USED THE CARD OTHER COMMENTS FROM. COMMITTEE YOUR QUESTIONS. I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY -- I'M SORRY DID YOU WANT TO CLOSE. NO THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE YOU ASKED FOR YOUR EYE BELOW. THANK YOU I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL THIS IS CLEARLY YOU KNOW A BIG.

RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE SOURCES FOR OF IGNITION FOR WILD FIRES FROM HUMAN ACTIVITY INCLUDING ELECTRIFY THE ENERGY POWER LINES. DE ENERGIZING POWER LINES IS ONE OF THE MITIGATION MEASURES SUCH PROPOSED WHAT WE KNOW OF COURSE THAT THAT HAS HUGE IMPACT SOMETIMES ON COMMUNITIES -- AND A LOT OF OUR WORLD COMMUNITIES ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO THIS. ENERGY STORAGE IN DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES LOCATED IN AFFECTED COMMUNITIES COULD ENABLE THE CENTRAL LOADS TO REMAIN SERVICE IN THE FACE OF MORE FREQUENT GREAT OUTAGES I'M PROVIDE RESILIENCY FOR THE COMMITTEE. AB ELEVEN FORTY FOUR REQUIRES THAT CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO USE UP INCENTIVE PROGRAM FUNDS FROM TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TO BE ALLOCATED TOWARDS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FACILITIES. IN HIGH FIRE THREAT DISTRICTS THE INITIATIVE FUNDS IN THIS BILL COULD SUPPORT MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE LARGE FACILITIES SUCH AS WATER SUPPLIERS WATERSHED AGENCIES HOSPITALS IN CAMPUSES.

RECENT PRICE SPIKES IN CALIFORNIA RESULTED IN OVER EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND NATURAL GAS PURCHASES TO SUPPLY ELECTRICITY TO AND USE CUSTOMERS. THE ONSET OF THIS WAS UNEXPECTED IN THE CAUSE NOT YET FULLY KNOWN. THE UTILITY SERVING MY DISTRICT EDISON ELLIE W. P. BURBANK WATER POWER AND GLENDALE WATER POWER AND THE REPAIRS OF ALL BEEN HIT HARD BY THESE PRICE SPIKES AND I'MSURE YOU ALL EXPERIENCE THE SAME THING IN YOUR DISTRICTS. AB SEVENTY NINETY NINE REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION TO COLLECT AND ANALYZE CERTAIN DATA REGARDING NATURAL GAS MARKETS TO DETERMINE THE CAUSES OF NATURAL GAS PRICE VOLATILITY EXPERIENCED BY END USERS. THE CDC WOULD ESTABLISH THE JOINT AGENCY NATURAL GAS MARKET OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE TO GATHER ANALYZE AND MAKE REFERRALS TO THE ENFORCEMENT DIVISION OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. THE BILL IS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE WHAT DATE IS NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING CAUSES A PRICE VOLATILITY AND THE STEPS OF ME TAKEN TO LIMIT. WHILE MUCH OF THE STATE IS CURRENTLY SUBMITTED TO THE STATE IT'S DONE SO IN A PIECEMEAL FASHION AND THIS WOULD ENSURE MUCH GREATER GOVERNMENT -- TRIP -- TRANSPARENCY AB SEVENTY NINETY NINE WILL REQUIRE THE COLLECTION OF INDIVIDUAL NATURAL GAS TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION COMPANY DATA IN A MORE HOLISTIC AND COMPREHENSIVE MANNER. THE BILL ALSO DIRECTS ALL LOAD SERVING ENTITIES I USE MINIS AND CCA'S TO SUBMIT A WHOLESALE MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PLANS. THESE PLANS BUT INCLUDE HOW THEY WOULD REDUCE THE RISK FROM PRICE VOLATILITY IN THE WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS MARKETS BUT WHILE REDUCING OVERALL GREENHOUSE GASES AN INCREASE IN THE USE OF CLEAN ENERGY. REQUIRING A LECTURE PROVIDERS TO PLAN FOR UNLIMITED PRICE VOLATILITY WHILE REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SUPPORTS THE STATE'S CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS WHILE PROTECTING CONSUMERS. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY AS A WITNESS IS LARA NAVARRO WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND. HI EVERYBODY THANK YOU FOR STAYING SO LATE -- THIS EVENING THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE BILL MEANT TO SAVE YOUR CONSTITUENTS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE SAW -- A PRICE SPIKE LAST YEAR TO THE CALIFORNIA COST PEOPLE ON THE GROUND HOMEOWNERS -- REAL PEOPLE ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS SO THIS BILL IS MEANT TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE AVOID IT THOSE SORTS A PRICE SPIKE SO WE SEE MUCH SMOOTHER PRICES. IN REAL PEOPLE'S ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY BILLS SO BASICALLY IT REQUIRES THE STATE AGENCIES WHO WORK ON ELECTRICITY ISSUES TO COLLECT DATA AND ANALYZE THAT DATA. THAT WILL GIVE US INFORMATION WHAT CROSSES PRICE VOLATILITY I WOULD ALSO REQUIRE LOW SERVING ENTITIES. TO INCLUDE MEASURES TO MANAGE THOSE RISKS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED. AND SMOOTHED OUT PRICE VOLATILITY IN THEIR I. R. PEAS THIS BILL WOULD HELP REAL CALIFORNIA FAMILIES TO SAVE MONEY AND HAVE PREDICTABLE ENERGY BILLS WHICH I THINK WE CAN ALL APPRECIATE. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE TONIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. GOOD EVENING OF FURTHER ALONG ON BEHALF OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL IN SUPPORT.
