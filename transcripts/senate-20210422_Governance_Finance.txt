NOW GIVE ME MOVING INTO OUR SPECIAL ORDER HEARING- SB NINE SB TEN IS WELL AS SB FIVE FIVE SIX LADIES AND GENTLEMEN COMMITTEE I'M GOING TO BE TURNING IN THE GAVEL OVER TO OUR VERY CAPABLE VICE CHAIR. TO BE ABLE TO RUN THE MEETING ON SB NINE PROBABLY PRESENTING SB NINE ON BEHALF OF PRESIDENT ATKINS I GIVE THIS AT THIRTY SECONDS AS WE MAKE THE TRANSITION. HELLO SIR. THE PERFECT WHEN READY MISS THURMAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER VICE CHAIR INTO MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE OUT OF PRISON SENATE BILL NINE ON BEHALF OF PROTEIN. TODAY FOR MANY VIEW THIS BILL IS GOING TO BE FAMILIAR IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SAW LAST YEAR WAS SENATE BILL ELEVEN TWENTY RIGHT NOW THERE ARE SOME VERY KEY IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE'D LIKE TO BE A TO TALK ABOUT HERE TODAY. ALONG THE SAME LINES- ON BEHALF OF THE PROTEIN I'D LIKE TO GET EXCEPT THE TECHNICAL COMMITTEE MINUTES OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS AND APPRECIATE THROUGH THE GREAT WORK BY MR NOW IN THE ENTIRE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE TEAM SB NINE PROMOTE SMALL SCALE NEIGHBORHOOD DRIVEN RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS BY STREAMLINING THE PROCESS FOR A HOMEOWNER TO CREATE A DUPLEX. OR SUBDIVIDING THE EXISTING LOT IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS UP TO FOUR UNITS SB NINE REALLY STRIKES AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN RESPECTING LOCAL CONTROL AND CREATING THE ENVIRONMENT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PRODUCTION OF SMALL SCALE DEVELOPMENT THAT WE SO BADLY NEED TO COMBAT THIS ACUTE HOUSING CRISIS THAT EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA. IN ORDER TO PROTECT EXISTING TENANTS ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY IN COSTA REQUIREMENTS SB NINE ESTABLISHES A SPECIFIC LIST OF QUALIFICATIONS. THAT MUST BE MET AND THERE ARE SEVERAL SAFEGUARDS IN THIS CRITICAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION I LIKE TO WALK THROUGH THOSE NOW. FIRST OFF HISTORIC AND LANDMARK DISTRICTS THEIR EXCLUDED FROM THE BILL. THE COASTAL ACT IT STILL APPLIES. THE BILL CAN BE USED ON FARMLANDS FLOOD ZONES FAULTLINES HABITAT FOR PROTECTED SPECIES IN OTHER ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREAS. IN THE BILL GUARDS AGAINST SPECULATION AND GENTRIFICATION IT ALSO IS VERY FOCUSED ON TENANT PROTECTION. SB NINE LIMITS INDIVIDUALS FROM RECEIVING MINISTERIAL LOT SPLITS ON ADJACENT PARCELS THE BILL TO PREVENT- INVESTOR SPECULATION WHICH HAS BEEN A CONCERN FOR SOME IN THE PRO TEMAS PROACTIVELY BEEN FOCUSED ON THAT. AND PROFITEERS FROM EVICTING OR DISPLACING TENANTS BY EXCLUDING PROPERTIES WHERE A TENANT HAS RESIDED IN THE PAST THREE YEARS. THREE YEARS MEMBERS. SB NINE NOW ALSO PROVIDES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE AUTHORITY TO ENACT AN OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE OPPORTUNITY THAT THIS CRITICAL LEGISLATION PROVIDES FOR FOUND FAMILIES TO HAVE MORE OPTIONS TO BUILD. MULTI GENERATIONAL HOUSING AND BUILD MULTI GENERATIONAL WEALTH WHICH IS SO KEY AS WE KNOW FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS THEIR HOME IS THEIR NUMBER ONE INVESTED IT'S THEIR NUMBER ONE MISTAKE AND THAT'S WHY INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH IS SO IMPORTANT. IT'S A CRUCIAL TO COMBAT INEQUITY IN CREATING SOCIAL MOBILITY ESPECIALLY IN NEIGHBORHOODS OR OUTDATED ZONING LAWS HAVE CREATED BARRIERS TO AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP. AND HAVE LED TO OVERCROWDING NOW THIS BILL PROVIDES HOMEOWNERS WITH OPTIONS TO PROVIDE RENTAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR OTHER WORKING FAMILIES WHO MAY BE STRUGGLING TO FIND A HOME IN THEIR PRICE RANGE OR WHO AY BE LOOKING FOR THEIR OWN PATH TO MORE AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP. BILLS AND EXPAND OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERYONE HOMEOWNERS AND RENTERS AND FAMILIES ALIKE WE KNOW THAT THIS HOUSING CRISIS IS AN ISSUE SO LARGE THAT THERE IS NOT A SINGLE SOLUTION NO SILVER BULLET. BUT THAT'S WHY SB NINE IS PART OF THE SENATE HOUSING PACKAGE. BUILDING OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL I WANT TO THINK SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR THEIR TIME AND COMMITMENT SENATOR WIENER WHO IS AUTHORED KEY PIECES OF LEGISLATION IS HOUSING PACKAGE. AND OF COURSE TO SENATOR DORADO SENATOR ARTHUR WAS BEEN WORKING FOR THE GREATER PART OF TWO YEARS ON THE HOUSING WORKING GROUP. IN ON BEHALF OF THE PROTEIN WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO FOR YOUR DEDICATION REALLY DRIVING HOME SOLUTIONS TO THIS HOUSING CRISIS. THE PROGRAM IS TRULY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE BY THE ENTIRE SENATE ON THIS HOUSING PACKAGE. THIS PACKAGE MAKES HOUSING MORE POSSIBLE EVEN WHILE WE CONTINUE WORKING THROUGH THE NEW REALITIES IN UNCERTAIN TIMES OF THIS PANDEMIC. SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF SB NINE WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT ERIC PHILLIPS IS COMING WITH US INTO IT WE ALSO HAVE A LEASE PUKE WITH UNITED WAY LA ON THE LINE. IN WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE MISTER VICE CHAIR AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU AGAIN VERY GOOD- HAVE OPENED. DO YOU HAVE MISTER ERIC PHILLIPS HERE PRESENT. TESTIFYING SUPPORT YES PRESIDENT. THANK YOU. YOU CAN PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR OF MORNING- MY NAME IS- PHILLIPS REPRESENTING FACT CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN SPENDING ASSOCIATION AND WE ARE PLEASED TO JOANNE SENATE PRO TEM ATKINS- THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AND MEMBERS AND SUPPORT OF SB NINE AND THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP BOTH ON THIS BILL AND THE SENATE HOUSING PACKAGE IN GENERAL. AS WE ALL KNOW HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY CONTINUE TO BE AMONG CALIFORNIA'S MOST PRESSING ISSUES ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY CAUSES OF THE HOUSING CRISIS I HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS SOME OF WHICH CLEANERS HAVE CREATED QUITE A PART. FOR EXAMPLE UNDER CURRENT LAW THE MAJORITY OF RESIDENTIAL AREAS CAN ONLY BE USED TO CREATE SINGLE FAMILY DWELLINGS. OBVIOUSLY THIS LIMITS HOUSING SUPPLY BUT IT ALSO EXCLUDES LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS FROM HOUSING AND THIS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS MINORITY COMMUNITIES. SB NINE CAN BE PART OF THE EFFORT TO EXPAND HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT SB NINE DOES NOT PROHIBIT SINGLE FAMILY HOMES OR ZONING IT SIMPLY PROVIDES THAT IN THOSE AREAS PROPERTY OWNERS MUST ALSO BE ALLOWED TO CREATE SMALL MULTI FAMILY HOUSING OPTIONS. SB NINE CREATE A BY RIGHT MINISTERIAL APPROVAL PROCESS FOR THE CREATION OF TWO TO FOUR HOMES IN SINGLE FAMILY DOLLAR. IT ALLOWS PARCEL MAPS THEY CREATE TWO LOTS FROM ONE AND PERMITS THEM TO HOMES PER LOCK. SHE LIVES WITH TWO HOMES AT EACH DATA SET AB YOU LAWS ALREADY ALLOW UP TO THREE UNITS PER LOT SO THIS IS ONLY AN INCREMENTAL CHANGE IN INTENSITY BUT THE PARCEL MAP PROVISIONS. ALLOW NEW HOMES TO BE SOLD WHICH CAN HELP CREATE HOME OWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES BUT ARE NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE UNDER OTHER HOUSING. PRODUCTION AND STREAMLINING BILLS. I DON'T ALTHOUGH THE APPROVAL IS IN. THE MAJORITY OBJECTIVE PLANNING STANDARDS WILL CONTINUE TO APPLY TO NEW DEVELOPMENT SB NINE EVEN INCLUDES A SEQUEL EXEMPTION FOR THE ADOPTION OF NEW IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS. AND THIS APPROACH WILL HELP BALANCE STATE AND LOCAL INTEREST. SB NINE DEFINES MINIMUM PERFORMANCE TARGETS THAT APPLY STATEWIDE BUT IT LEAVES ROOM FOR LOCAL PLANNERS TO DEFINE AND APPLY CONTEXT SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR THOSE TWO TO FOUR UNITS PER LOT. FINALLY IN CONCLUSION OUR HOPE IS THAT INCREASING HOUSING CHOICE AND SINGLE FAMILY ZONES WILL MAKE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES MORE INCLUSIVE. BUT THIS CANNOT COME AT THE COST OF DESTABILISING EXISTING NEIGHBORHOODS THAT IS WHY WE SUPPORT THE BILLS SEEK GUARDS TO PREVENT THE LOSS OF EXISTING HELPING AND DISPLACEMENT OF VULNERABLE TENANTS- I THINK AGAIN WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB NINE. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE AND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING. WE ALSO HAVE LISA BLAKE THE UNITED WAY LOS ANGELES. LISA ARE YOU ON. Q. HERE. I AM THANK YOU.

WE FEEL THAT SB NINE STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE ABSOLUTE MENTIONED AND RESPECTING LOCAL CONTROL BUT ALSO CREATING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SMALL SCALE NEIGHBORHOOD DEVELOPMENT BENEFITS NOT ONLY THE BROADER COMMUNITY BUT ALSO OUR WORKERS WHO ARE GETTING PUSHED OUT OF THE REGION IN TERMS OF BEING CLOSE TO THEIR JOBS WE KNOW THAT SB NINE WILL NOT SOLVE OUR FORCING OUR HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS HUNDRED SANDWICH AND WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH FORWARD ON ALL FRONTS FROM INCREASING RUNNER PROTECTION.

THANK YOU OPERATOR AND THANK YOU ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE CALLED IN FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE LIMITATIONS OF OUR TIME. WE WILL NOW PROCEED WITH THE HEARING AND THE FENDER WOULD YOU LIKE TO GIVE A CALL FOR CENTER ADVERSE. WE GET- YEAH THAT'S TAKEN BACK TO THE COMMITTEE DO WE HAVE A MOTION AND OUR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OF OUR MEMBERS. VETR DORADO. IF I GOT EMOTIONAL OKAY THE NUMBER IS MOVE AND I I'M I'M ASKING ABOUT WHAT OKAY I GOT A SERIES QUESTIONS. ON BEHALF OF THIS MEASURE- THE SURE. ARE THERE WANT TO CLARIFY YOU KNOW THIS IS BEEN A LONG DISCUSSION AS YOU EXPRESSED IN YOUR OPENING OFF ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS AND OUR EFFORTS TO BUILD HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA AND WE IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE DONE A LOT OF THINGS NOW A WITH WITH ISSUES OF ON ADAPTIVE RE USE LISTENER KERR HEROES. BILL AND ALMOST OTHER THING IN THE KNOW I WORK ON THE IDEA OF BUILDING HOMES. DEALING WITH THE. RICH PART OF OUR AND TRYING BUILD MORE HOMES THIS IS A LAW OF IT IN THAT REGARD BUT I'VE A LOT QUESTION IF I CAN JUST SURE. BECAUSE I'VE GOTTEN A LOT OF ACTIVITY FROM THE COMMUNITIES THAT I REPRESENT THAT ARE QUITE CONCERNED AND THE POINT ABOUT AMBIGUITY SO I JUST YOU KNOW YOU SAID THIS AN OPENING BUT IF I COULD MISTER CHAIRMAN JUST MAKE SOME CLARIFICATIONS ONE. HISTORIC OVER LOSING OVERLAYS OWNS ARE EXEMPT IS THAT A CORRECT STATEMENT. MARK ZONES IN LANDMARK DISTRICTS ARE EXEMPT OKAY THANK YOU THAT WAS SOMETHING IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT PORT SECOND. FROM THERE WAS A NUMBER OF COMMUNICATIONS THAT ARE RECEIVED FROM FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT WERE CONCERNED THAT THERE WAS AMBIGUITY IN THIS MEASURE THAT ALTHOUGH IT WAS REPRESENTED ONLY LIMITED FOR THAT IN FACT THERE COULD BE EIGHT UNITS THERE WAS SOME EXPERTS THAT WERE OPINING IN MY UNDERSTANDING IF IT'S CORRECT. THAT THE LANGUAGE THE AMENDMENTS I SAW HERE CHANGE IT AND MAKE IT CLEAR EXPLICIT THAT THERE CANNOT BE MORE THAN FOUR UNITS IS THAT FAIR TO SAY. YOU'RE 1100% CORRECT AND THEN CONSIDER BEEN PRESENTED MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THERE CAN BE NO MORE THAN FOUR UNITS ON ONE- WILL DEPART ON A SPLIT ESTATE ONLY GET TO THOSE QUESTIONS AGGRESSORS FOR SECOND NEXT QUESTION. UNDER OUR CURRENT EIGHTY YOU LAW RIGHT THE CURRENT LAW IF NOTHING CHANGED TODAY IN SINGLE FAMILY ZONES. THE REALITY IS WITH AN INDIVIDUAL IN A SINGLE FAMILY LOT COULD BUILD A JUNIOR EIGHTY YOU WHICH WOULD ATTACHED TO THEIR HOME. AND THE SECOND EIGHTY YOU THAT THEY COULD BUILD A RADIO SEPARATE EIGHTY YOU TAKE A GARAGE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WAS DETACHED FROM THE HOUSE AND THEN YOU UNDER CURRENT LAW. MY UNDERSTANDING I WANT CLARIFICATION FOR THIS FOR THE RECORD THAT YOU HAVE THREE UNITS CORRECT. AT A PARTICULAR PARTIAL. CHECK GREATLY. OKAY AND NOW WHAT DONE IS RES OF THE HOMEWORK HERE IS YOU SHOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY. MERYL THIS EARLIER DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD IN SB FIFTY AND ALL THOSE OTHER ISSUES SO BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS EXPANDING FROM THREE TO FOUR CORRECT. 101% CORRECT IN MY UNDERSTANDING IS IF I UNDERSTAND THIS ALL THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS BILL THAT THERE ARE BASICALLY THREE CHANGES IN PARTICULAR THREE PARTICULAR CHANGE ON A MAKES A COUPLE OF THE CHANGES. IN THIS MEASURE AS IT NOW HAS BEEN AMENDED AND DISCUSSED AND AMENDED DISCUSSION AMENDED DISCUSSED AS TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY HE'S ONE. WE GO FROM THREE TO FOUR HONOR SKIRT CURRENT LOT TO. THAT THE LOT CAN BE LOT SPLIT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THAT BEFORE BY RIGHT THAT HE COULD HAVE A LOT SPLIT AS LONG AS YOU MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS AND THREE. SETBACK REQUIREMENTS CONFORM TO THE EIGHTY YOU SET BACK REQUIREMENTS TO FOUR FEET BECAUSE IN MY COMMUNITIES I HAVE FIVE ON THE SIDE AND FIFTEEN IN THE FRONT BUT YOU CAN GO TO FOR SO IT'S IN THE SIDE CHICK IT'S REDUCED BY ONE FOOT THOSE ARE. THE PRINCIPLE CHANGES IN ADDITION THE THING THAT PORTANTINO CENTER PORTANTINO AND I WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT I BELIEVE HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED HERE. IS THIS CORPORATIZATION THAT FUNDAMENTALLY WAS MENTIONED IN THE- THE PROPONENTS OF THIS LIKE WELL TO QUOTE DOWN CAN'T. YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE GOOD THE COSTS ARE COULD NOT COME AT THE COST OF DESTABILISING EXISTING NEIGHBORHOODS SO THE CONCERN AND A COUPLE OF THE OPPONENTS I LISTENED TO THE- OPPOSITION. WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT DEVELOPERS CORPORATE TIES IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND THAT I READ HERE I COULD GO TO THE CITATION. THAT THE PERSON HAS TO OWN ONE OF THE PROPERTIES. HAVE TO BE OWNER OCCUPIED IS THAT CORRECT. THE NEW AMENDMENTS PROVIDE. A COUNCIL OR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO PUT AN OWNERSHIP CLAUSE IN ORDINANCE INTO PLACE YOUR 100% CORRECT OKAY AND THEN IN ADDITION. THE OTHER ISSUE WAS WHEN WE LOOKED AT S. B. FIFTY THAT I VEHEMENTLY OPPOSED. LAST YEAR. ON THE CITY OF SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND WHICH DOES INCLUDE YOUR COMMUNITIES BUT CERTAINLY INCLUDES THE COMMUNITIES THAT I REPRESENT SENATOR ALSO REPRESENTS. YOU COULD HAVE HAD IF YOU'RE WITHIN A QUARTER OF A MILE OF THE MAJOR TRANSIT STOP A FIFTY FIVE FOOT FOUR STORIES TO FIVE STORAGE UNIT. WHICH IS NO LONGER THE CASE UNDER THIS BILL IS THAT FAIR TOSAY. TO SAY AND IT'S NOT JUST A MAJOR TRANSISTOR UNDER SB FIFTY IT WAS ALSO GOING TO BE A BUS STOP ORIGINALLY SO. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE IS NO LINK TO ANY TRANSIT IN THIS BILL. OKAY A COUPLE MORE APOLOGIST SO MUCH WITH THIS IS IT REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT I DON'T SPEND MUCH TIME ON THE STUFF. BUT THIS IS SOMETHING IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME ON THESE ISSUES. SO WITH RESPECT TO THE POWER IN THIS TO THIS ISSUE THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING AND WE'VE DEALT WITH THIS ON SO MANY ISSUES OVER THE YEARS I WAS ASKING THE NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCIL ONCE YOU SUPPORT LOCAL CONTROL. BUT I DO ACCEPT THEIR CERTAIN ISSUES OF STATEWIDE CONCERN YOU CAN'T DISCRIMINATE LOCALLY AND SAY WELL. I'M NOT GOING TO THAT AND WE'VE HAD THESE ISSUES DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES HAVE RESPONDED TO IT DIFFERENTLY WE'RE TRYING TO MEET HOUSING REQUIREMENTS. AND WE SET UP A HOUSING ELEMENT MANY DECADES AGO AND IT HASN'T WORKED VERY WELL. AND SO WE'VE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH THIS THE GOVERNOR CAME UP WITH AN IDEA IS WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOUR TRANSIT FUNDS IF YOU DON'T MEET OR WORK AT ALL. GREAT ABILITY FOR A COURT TO CREATE AN ORDER WE'VE BEEN DEBATING. HOW TO WE QUITE A WE DEAL WITH THIS DYNAMIC BETWEEN TRYING TO CREATE HOUSING WHICH IS OUR OBLIGATION TO STATE. AND THE IMPORTANT POWER OF THE LOCALS. TO ME WHEN I WHEN I LOOK AT THIS THING THE BIG ISSUE THAT. I SEE REMAINING. IN TERMS OF THAT BECAUSE- YOU KNOW THERE IS. FROM GUY. IN THIS THING. AND BUT BUT FOR ME IT'S- BUT WHAT I FIND IN THE POINT WAS RAISED THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE STILL ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION ON THIS. IS THE ISSUE OF THE FOOT PRINT THE ISSUE OF THE ENVELOPE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IS THAT SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THE PROPERTY SO NOW I'M IN A SITUATION WHERE. I HAVE MY PROPERTY MY HOUSE LET'S ASSUME IT'S TEN THOUSAND SQUARE FEET IS THE LAND OF I'M ON. AND I COULD SPLIT IT FOUR THOUSAND SIX THOUSAND OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE AND THE SECOND ONE I NOW MAKE A LOT THAT I COULD SELL SEPARATELY BECAUSE IT'S NOW SEPARATE PARTIAL RIGHT. UNDER THE CURRENT ENVELOPE TERM. OR FOOT PRINT TERM. MATCHES TO MY HOUSE FOR EASE OF EXAMPLES TWO THOUSAND SQUARE FEET. SO AM I LIMITED IN THE BUILDING OF A NEW PROPERTY AND I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS I'M NOT SURE YOU DO BUT I. THE BOTTOM LINE IS I WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS. TO TWO THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OF NEW STRUCTURE OR IF THE FOOTPRINT IS. TEN BY TEN JUST FOR EASE OF EXAMPLE. COULD I GO THREE STORIES HIGH ASSUMING THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALLOWED ME. THAT ACTUALLY GO. THREE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET INSTEAD OF A HUNDRED IF IT WAS TEN BY TEN. RIGHT WATER ONE OF THOSE FACTORS IN DETERMINING THE DEFINITION. BETWEEN SQUARE FOOTAGE. IN ENVELOPE OR FOOTPRINT DO YOU HAVE ANY HELP YOU CAN HELP ME ON THAT YEAH. FIRST AND FOREMOST I THINK IT'S REALLY CRITICAL TO BE ABLE TO DEFINE. WHAT IS STILL IN PLACE WITH THIS BILL. THERE'S BEEN SOME CONCERN. THAT FLOOR AREA RATIO WOULD RISE FOR NOW. SOME CONCERN THAT HEIGHT LIMITS WOULD BE RIGHT TURN OUT A LOT OF CONCERN IT BACKS UP. IT ALL REMAINS. IT ALL REMAINS. SO I'M GONNA GIVE AN EXAMPLE OKAY- MY NEIGHBORHOOD. WE LIVE ON A QUARTER ACRE LOTS. OKAY UNDER THIS BILL- IN THE CITY THAT I LIVE IN. FOR DUPLEX. YOU COULD NOT BUILD A THREE STORY DUPLEX IT WOULD BE OUTSIDE OF THE NORM THAT WOULD BE ALLOWED UNDER ZONING. IN THE CITY THEY RESIDE IN SO IF YOU CAN ESSENTIALLY BUILD A SINGLE FAMILY HOME BEHIND YOUR HOME THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO BUILD THE DUPLEX- BUT AGAIN THERE IS NO DOUBLE DIPPING IF YOU HAVE A JUNIOR EIGHTY YOU AN EIGHTY YOU ON THERE ALREADY YOU CAN'T BUILD A DUPLEX BOTTOM LINE CORRECT. AND THE LAST PIECE OF SPACE LOCAL REQUIREMENTS STILL APPLY- AS LONG AS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T PRECLUDE A DUPLEX FROM BEING BUILT. FLOOR AREA RATIO. SET BACK HEIGHT REQUIREMENTS ALSO APPLIES IN THIS BILL. BUT SO COULD A COLLEGES I AM SORRY I DID I WAS VERY GOOD AT EXPLAINING MY QUESTION SO YOU BEEN APPRECIATE THE YOUR ATTENTION TO DETAIL ON THIS. SO IF BY NOW HAVE A TWO THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT HOUSE OKAY. THAT BOND HAS A CERTAIN SIZE FOOT PRINT- ENVELOPE WHATEVER THE TERM WAS AM I LIMITED TO BUILDING TWO THOUSAND SQUARE FEET TOTAL SOME OF THE PEOPLE I TALKED TO THE COMMITTEES ARE REPRESENTING DETAIL THEY'RE NOT SO WORRIED AS MUCH ABOUT ME THEY THEY THEY TALK ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT I. YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT DYNAMIC THERE CRUISING HOUSING SUPPLY I HAVE FOURTEEN THOUSAND EIGHTY USE IN MY COMMUNITY- ALREADY SO LARGEST NOT GROUP OF FORTY YEARS IN THE WHOLE STATE A AND A PARTICULAR THING OF COMMITTEES IN NORTHEAST SECTION IS BEEN PHENOMENALLY SUCCESSFUL AND WITHOUT COMPLAINT AND WORK EXTREMELY WELL WITH FAMILY MEMBERS MOVING TO SPEND TO TASTIC. SO I DON'T THINK IT WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT THE EIGHTY USE THE ISSUE IS IF IT IS A REAL FEAR OF CORPORATE IS ATION AND CHANGING THE CHARACTER OF A SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOOD AND IF YOU HAVE A TEAR DOWN OR SUBSTANTIAL TEAR DOWN HOW BIG COULD THE BILL BACK IT'S THIS WE SEE IT MENTIONED IS ATION IN THE SLIGHTLY BUT COUNCIL I MEAN THESE NEIGHBORHOOD COMMITTEES AS WELL. HOW BIG CAN A BILL BACKED BY THE LIMITED BY SQUARE FOOT LIMITATION IN TERMS OF WHAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE REBUILD OF A SUBSTANTIAL TEAR DOWN OR ARE THEY LIMITED JUST BY THE ENVELOPE AND THEN OKAY THE LOCAL ORDINANCES WILL WILL- REGULATE THE HEIGHT ACTUALLY SOME GUIDANCE ON THAT COUNCILMAN CLEAR ABOUT THAT AND I APOLOGIZE NO YOU'RE YOU'RE GOOD MR MAJORITY LEADER SO THE POSITIVE PIECE OF THIS BILL. IT STILL MAINTAINS LOCAL CONTROL FOR EXAMPLE AND I DON'T MEAN TO BE SQUISHY BUT IT'S GOING TO BE DEPENDENT ON THE CITY OR COUNTY ORDINANCE SO FOR EXAMPLE. IF THE CITY. ALLOWS FOR THAT SINGLE FOR HOME- DO ABLE TO BE BUILT FOR A DUPLEX BE ABLE TO BE BUILT. THAT CITY OR COUNTY CAN IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS AS LONG AS- AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T PRECLUDE THE BUILDING OF TWO TWO UNITS. SO IT'S UP TO THE CITY. WHICH IS THE POSITIVE PIECE OF THIS BILL. SO THEY COULD DO HI RESTRICTIONS THE GUY WAS TALKING AMERISOURCEBERGEN BUT THIS IT IS IT WAS YOU KNOW GATHERING DATA AND TRYING TO GET YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND THIS BETTER AND HE WAS SAYING YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY'RE DOING IS LIMITING HEIGHT RESTRICTIONS IN THEIR CITY THAT THEY'RE LIMITING THE DESIGN RESTRICTIONS YOU CAN'T BUILD A MONSTROSITY BEHIND YOUR HOUSE THAT LOOKS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT- HOUSE THAT HAS TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE DESIGN SO IT DOESN'T UPSET THE- INTEGRITY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD TRYING TO FIGURE OUT STANDARDS WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME. IS THAT YOUR INTERPRETATION OF THIS BILL IS THE DATA AUTHORITY STILL RESTS WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS LONG AS THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE THEY HAVE NO ABILITY TO SAY NO TO A DUPLEX BIG THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE. YOU COULD YOU CAN'T GO PAST FOUR SO IF YOU HAVE A OP YOU'RE SINGLE FAMILY HOME WITH THE JUNIOR EIGHTY YOU AND THEN YOU DO A LOT SPLIT YOUR DUPLEX IN THE BACK THAT'S IT AND THAT TO ME IS CLEAR BECAUSE I SAW THAT THERE WAS A LACK OF CLARITY BEFORE. IT'S BEEN RAISED BY PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY. WE AGREED WITH THAT AND FIXED IT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ALSO- DESIGN RESTRICTIONS ON THESE UNITS STILL APPLY OKAY SO IT'S COOKED IN BUILT INTO THIS BILL. ONLY TWO PER PARCEL. A TOTAL OF FOUR SO IF I'M USING MY EXAMPLE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD RIGHT. I COULD TRANSITION ONE TIME MY SINGLE FAMILY TWO DUPLEX. AND I COULD PUT TWO UNITS BEHIND MY HOME IF I WANTED TO. IN FACT ALL THE SAME IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD- WE HAVE DUPLEXES IN EIGHTY USE GT USE ALL THROUGHOUT AND IT HAS BEEN DONE OVER TIME BUT- I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT THE DESIGN REVIEW. IN DESIGN RESTRICTIONS ALL STILL APPLY WITH YOUR CITY AND THAT'S THE POWERFUL PIECE OF THIS BILL. OKAY SO THIS LAST POINT I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE AND ALL THIS BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS JUST TAKE AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF TIME AND ATTENTION THE COMMITTEES ARE PRESENT. IN TRYING TO. BRING THEIR POINT OF VIEW TO THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE FRUSTRATIONS THAT THEY'VE EXPRESSED AND IT'S OFTEN IT'S HARDER HERE'S THE AUTHOR OF SB FIFTY THAT YOU KNOW MISTER WINNER JUST WALKED IN AND YOU KNOW EVERYBODY STILL SEES THIS IS THAT AND IT'S COMPLETELY COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. OKAY I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WHAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT HERE PARTICULAR SQUARE FOOTAGE VERSUS. VERSUS ENVELOPE IN THE LIKE WE GET BUT I'M JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE HAVE CLARITY ON THAT BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY LAND USE LAWYERS AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE FORTY OPINIONS AND THEY'RE CRAWLING ALL OVER THIS AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THIS UNDERSTANDING THAT IT GOES FROM THREE TO FOUR WHICH I KNOW IT DOES BUT THE BIG ISSUE IS IF THERE'S A TEARDOWN IS THE BIG QUESTION ARE SUBSTANTIAL TEAR DOWN WHAT IS THAT REPLACEMENT LOOK LIKE AND WHAT ARE THE LIMIATIONS THAT ARE IMPOSED UPON LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH RESPECT TO THAT TURNED OUT. THAT TO ME IS THE CRUX OF THE REMAINING QUESTION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE RAISE THE QUESTION ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE MANY OTHER AVENUES THAT HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLY TAKEN WITH RESPECT TO THIS LEGISLATURE THAT'S GOING TO. DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE YOU KNOW AND- CHALLENGING SITUATIONS WITH RESPECT AFFORDABILITY AND WILL BE DEALING WITH THAT THE VERY SIGNIFICANT HUESO WITH THAT I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN FOR BEING SO PATIENT. MR MAJORITY LEADER LOOK I THINK THE MAJORITY LEADER BRINGS UP SOME. VERY VALID POINTS TODAY. BUT I WANNA RE. WHERE WE WERE IN WHERE THIS BILL WOULD GO. THE RESTRICTIONS FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT STILL APPLY WITH THIS BILL. THE ONLY THING THE CITY CAN'T DO IS BAN DUPLEX. IT'S ALSO CRITICAL TO SAY RIGHT NOW IN STATE LAW YOU CAN HAVE THREE UNITS ON YOUR PERSONAL SINGLE FAMILY HOME. A JUNIOR ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT AN ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS. THIS ONLY ADDS ONE. FLOOR AREA RATIO HEIGHT RESTRICTIONS ALONG WITH SET BACK STILL APPLIES OTHER GUARD RAILS THAT HAVE BEEN EMBEDDED IN THIS IS THAT IF AN INDIVIDUAL WANTED TO BUY TWO PARCELS THAT **** UP AGAINST THE PARCEL WE'RE GONNA PUT IN EIGHT TWO DUPLEXES YOU CAN'T DO THAT. SO THE SPECULATION OPPORTUNITY IS TAKEN OUT OF THIS BILL AND THE- OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF ALL THIS YOU ALL IS THAT THERE IS NOW AN ABILITY TO HAVE A HOME OWNERSHIP CLIENTS AGAIN THE PROGRAM IS AND REALLY FOCUS ON LOCAL CONTROL. IF THE CITY DECIDES TO PUT A HOME OWNERSHIP BECAUSE INTO THE BILL BY PASSING ORDINANCE THEY CAN DO IT THIS BILL NOW ALLOWS THEM THAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO HER TO BE ABLE TO BUILD THAT MULTI GENERATIONAL WEALTH. WE KNOW RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA FOR THOSE HOMEOWNERS THE NUMBER ONE MISTAKE THE NUMBER ONE INVESTMENT THAT FOLKS HAVE IS HOME OWNERSHIP. IN THIS IS GOING TO HELP BUILD MULTI GENERATIONAL WEALTH IN THE STATE THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS THIS LET'S TALK ABOUT AFFORDABLE- THEIR BEEN STUDIES SHOW THAT- ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS ARE ARE MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE THAN YOUR TYPICAL RENTAL SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE EAST BAY. IT'S ABOUT SOMEONE MAKING 62% OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME CAN AFFORD AN ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT RENT WHERE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD. A LARGE CONDO OR SINGLE FAMILY HOME WE KNOW THAT THESE UNITS ARE GOING TO BE MUCH MORE COMPETITIVE WHEN IT COMES TO MORE AFFORDABLE RENTS ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED. BY THE SKYROCKETING. RENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. SEVERAL DO NOT CENTER TO ROGER YOU HAVE MADE A MOTION TO DO WE SHOULD HAVE SOME QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YES PLEASE MISTER CHAIR DEVICE CHECK- IF YOU COULD SUMMARIZE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE CENTER HERTZBERG'S QUESTIONS HE'S HE REALLY GOT INTO SOME SPECIFICS THAT HELP ME UNDERSTAND FURTHER UNDERSTAND BUT IF YOU COULD SUMMARIZE- THE ISSUES THAT TENANTS COULD BE FACING THE KINDS OF. PROTECTIONS THAT OF FOR OUR TENANTS I HAVE IN MY DISTRICT THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE OF RENTERS IN THE STATE SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT. AND THERE'S ALWAYS OBVIOUSLY THE FEAR AND THE THREATS OF GENTRIFICATION. OF IN THE IN OUR DISTRICTS AND THESE ARE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HOLD ON. RENTING AND SO THEY'RE MUCH MORE SUBJECT ARE VULNERABLE. TO GENTRIFICATION AND SO I IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT- DO THIS BILL THANK YOU IT'S A GOOD IT'S A GREAT QUESTION CENTER DRAWS ON THANK YOU FOR THAT SO THIS BILL PREVENTS- PROFITEERS IF YOU WILL FROM EVICTING TENANTS IN FACT INVENTED IN THIS BILL. IT DOES NOT ALLOW THE TO PLEASE DISPLACING TENANTS. IN AN EXISTING STRUCTURE FOR THREE YEARS. THREE YEARS MEMBERS BUT THIS HAS STRONG TENANT PROTECTIONS AND IN FACT IT DOESN'T ALLOW- THE CONVERSION WHERE TENET HAS RESIDED IN HE PAST THREE YEARS WERE TEN ACTUALLY RESIDED SO LOOK IT'S CRITICAL IT IS STRONG TENANT PROTECTIONS EMBEDDED IN THIS BILL BECAUSE OF- THE CONCERNED IT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP BY THE MEMBERS OF THIS CAUCUS WHO SAID THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT TENANTS ARE PROTECTED- AND THERE IS A THREE YEAR TENURE PROTECTION BECAUSE- INDEBTED IN THE BILL. THANK. THE OTHER LAST DIESEL SAY IS WHEN IT COMES TO SUPPORT ACROSS THE STATE I KNOW THAT WE HAD AN INDIVIDUAL SAID THAT- THE MAYOR OF LOS ANGELES THAT WAS OPPOSED TO THE BILL I HE IS NOT IN FACT HE HAS NOT TAKEN A POSITION ON THE BILL WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THAT CLARIFIED THAT HE IS NOT TAKING. A POSITION ON THE BILL. MISTER CHAIR IF IT'S ALRIGHT I'D LIKE TO BE A CLOSE YEAH. SO I'D LIKE TO BE TO SAY THIS. STATE LAW CURRENTLY ALLOWS FOR THREE UNITS. THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR ONE ADDITIONAL UNIT. WITH A FOUR PLEX NUMBER ONE. OR TO. THERE'S A HOMEOWNERSHIP CLASS NOW IN THIS BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW FAMILIES TO BE ABLE TO BUILD MULTI GENERATIONAL WEALTH ON THAT PROPERTY. NUMBER THREE. FLOOR AREA RATIO HI IS WELL AS SET BACK ALL CRITICAL WHEN IT COMES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESIDENTIAL. PROPERTIES IN THE STATE ALL STILL APPLY YOU CANNOT DOUBLE DIP. WE HEARD SOME SAY THAT YOU CAN BUILD SIX UNITS YEAH YOU CAN'T DOUBLE DIP WITH THIS BILL IF THERE IS A G. EIGHTY YOU AN EIGHTY ON A SINGLE FAMILY HOME ALREADY ON THE PARCEL YOU CAN'T PUT IN A DUPLEX YOU SIMPLY CAN'T. AND IT'S CLEAR AS DAY IN THIS BILL YOU ALSO CAN'T COMBINE PARCELS TO BE ABLE TO BUILD A SMALL SUBDIVISION IT PRECLUDES THE ACT. IT ALSO NOW APPLIES TO HOMEOWNERS SO IF THE CITY COUNCIL WANTED TO BE ABLE TO PUT A HOMEOWNERSHIP COSTS ON TO THE PROPERTIES THAT WANT TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS ONE TIME CONVERSION THEY NOW HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO SO THAT YOU HAVE HOMEOWNERS LIVING. IN THOSE PROPERTIES IN THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS THIS. HOUSING LEGISLATION IS HARD. WE HEAR TIME AND TIME AGAIN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE CRISIS WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO TACKLE THAT CRISIS AND IS THIS A SILVER BULLET NOW BUT IS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO BE ABLE TO TAKE TO PRINT PROVIDE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA DURING THE SECURE CRISIS THAT'S IMPACTING WORKING FAMILIES AND SENIORS YES RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR. AN AYE VOTE MISTER CHAIR. GERMANY DIDN'T ACCEPT THOSE AMENDMENTS EARLY ON THAT THE TELEVISION AND RETENTION TECHNIQUE AND MAKE YOU SO MUCH ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION.

WITHOUT FURTHER DELAYS IN GERMAN WE'RE GOING TO TURN IT OVER FROM THE GOOD SENATOR FROM NAPA DEVELOPERS IN SB FIVE FIVE SIX. PERCENT OF THE FOR SURE SIR. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR YOUR INDULGENCE ON THIS REQUEST. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS SB FIVE FIVE SIX WOULD BRING CALIFORNIA ITS CONFORMANCE WITH EXISTING FEDERAL AND STATE LAW. SEEKING TO ACCELERATE DEPLOYMENT OF WIRELESS BROADBAND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. I AM ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS REFERENCE OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS PERTAINING TO THE STATIC STANDARDS AND TIMING AS THEY WERE DISCUSSED LAST MONDAY ON THE ENERGY UTILITIES AND COMMUNICATIONS HEARING. DEMAND FOR RELIABLE HIGH SPEED BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY HAS NEVER BEEN HIGHER THAN IT IS TODAY. THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS ONLY ELEVATED THE EXTENT TO WHICH BROADBAND ACCESS HAS BECOME ESSENTIAL FOR PARTICIPATING VIRTUALLY IN EVERY ASPECT. OF MODERN SOCIETY. ACCESSIBLE AND RELIALE BROADBAND NETWORKS ARE NOW MORE THAN EVER CRITICAL IN OUR DAILY LIVES YET TO MANY HOUSEHOLDS ACROSS THE STATE CAN'T ACCESS BROADBAND BECAUSE IT'S NOT AVAILABLE WHERE THEY LIVE. LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WORLD POPULATIONS AND WORKING FAMILIES WHO LACK BROADBAND RISK FALLING FURTHER BEHIND. THAT'S LEARNING HAS SHIFTED ONLINE STUDENTS MAY STRUGGLE TO KEEP UP. ADULT IN COMMUNITIES WITHOUT INTERNET ACCESS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEARCH AND APPLY FOR JOBS WORK REMOTELY START BUSINESSES OR ACCESS EDUCATIONAL SOCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES NEEDED TO THRIVE IN THIS DIGITAL ECONOMY. SB FIVE FIVE SIX WILL ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS BY CONFORMING CALIFORNIA STATE LAW WITH THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FCC FEDERAL REGULATION IN ORDER TO EXPAND. YEAH FIVE G. DEPLOYMENT IT CONTRIBUTE TO CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THIS BILL REQUIRES LOCALITIES TO GIVE ACCESS TO THEIR STREET LIGHTS AND TRAFFIC SIGNAL POLES IN ORDER FOR TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES TO ATTACH THEIR WIRELESS FACILITIES. THE BILL FOCUSES ON ENSURING THAT THE ACCESS TO THOSE POLLS IS PROVIDED AND IT NON DISCRIMINATORY. BOSTON BASED RATE. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE FCC ISSUED AN INFRASTRUCTURE ORDER THAT REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROVIDE THAT COST BASED RATE FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES TO ATTACH WIRELESS FACILITIES THE STREET LIGHT AND TRAFFIC SIGNAL POLES. THE FCC ESTIMATED THAT THAT PRESUMPTIVE RATE NOT DISCRIMINATORY RATE AT TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DOLLARS. HOWEVER MANY LOCALITIES ARE INTERPRETING THAT FEDERAL ORDER INCONSISTENTLY. THERE'S BEEN WIDESPREAD RESISTANCE NOT COMPLIANCE IT CONTINUED LITIGATION OVER THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ORDER. THERE'S BEEN WIPED. S. B. FIVE FIVE SIX WILL CREATE UNIFORMITY WITH THE FCC ORDER BY FIRST OFFERING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE OPTION TO CONFORM TO THE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DOLLAR FCC PRESUMPTIVE RATE. THE BILL ALSO PROVIDES FOR LOW GOVERNMENT WHO DO NOT WISH TO APPLY THAT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DOLLAR RATE THE OPTION. TO USE A CAR BASED ATTACHED RATE FORMULA THAT IS MODELED AFTER AB TEN TWENTY SEVEN PASSED. IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. THAT BECAUSE BE FOR ME BEEN YOU BY PUBLICLY ON UTILITIES FOR YOU. IT HAS BEEN APPLIED BY THE CPUC TO INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND TELEPHONE COMPANIES AS WELL. TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DOLLARS IS REALLY A SAFE HARBOR FOR LOCALITIES TO CHOOSE NOT TO APPLY THE FEE CALCULATION. THERE IS NOTHING IN THE BILL PROHIBITING THEM TO COME UP WTH A HIGHER RATE AFTER THEY'VE COMPLETED THEIR COST STUDY. FINALLY AUTHORS AMENDMENTS MOVED SUBSTANTIVE LANGUAGE OF SB FIVE FIVE SIX IT TO A STANDALONE PUBLIC UTILITY CODE SECTION TO ADDRESS CONCERNS OF THE P. O. U. S. AND THE CABLE ASSOCIATION. AS WELL AS A LIGHTING LANGUAGE ON REASONABLE COST WITH THE LANGUAGE OF THE FCC- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OR TO ADDRESS CONCERNS ARTICULATED. BY THE LEAGUE OF CITIES. GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE AMONG STAKEHOLDERS IN MY TEAM. WHILE THE AMENDMENTS ADDRESS SOME SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS RAISED BY STAKEHOLDERS. I KNOW THERE IS MORE WORK. TO BE DONE AND I AM ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO DOING THAT. ON THE PHONE TODAY IS BARBARA. THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NAPA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION IT IN THE HEARING ROOM TODAY ALSO IS RUDY RADIUS FROM VERIZON HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY I'VE BEEN THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS AND NAPA FOR. MY TWENTY YEAR. AND WE HAVE WORKED VERY HARD OBVIOUSLY WANT THE PANDEMIC HIT TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. HAVE ACCESS TO THE SERVICES THAT WE WERE PROVIDING REMOTELY. WE WENT OUT WE BOUGHT DEVICES WE BOUGHT HOT SPOTS WE ENSURED EVERY STUDENT HAD. BUT A DEVICE ON A HOT SPOT THAT HAS NO. TO CONNECT TO YOU IT DOESN'T HELP THEM TO DO THE WORK THAT WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DO. WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE COME BACK IN THE FALL EVEN AS WHO WILL CONTINUE TO RE OPEN THERE ARE GOING TO BE MANY FAMILIES WHO ARE AFRAID TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN BACK TO SCHOOL. SO THE NEED TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE CONNECTED TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE MORE CRITICAL THAN EVER. AND NOW WE'RE BEING ASKED NOT ONLY TO MAKE UP FOR THE LEARNING LAW BUT HEARD OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE ASKED TO DO MORE TO PROVIDE IN RICHMOND ACCELERATION. AND THE MOST ENGAGING AND MOTIVATING LESSONS ARE THOSE THAT ARE DONE THROUGH TECHNOLOGY. WE URGE CLEAN. IT IS UP. NOT IN THE- VISION OF EQUITY THAT WE HAVE FOR THE STATE THAT ONE IN HOMES IN CALIFORNIA STILL LACK ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED BROADBAND. WE HAVE GOT TO PROVIDE THAT FOR EVERY STUDENT IN EVERY SCHOOL AND PARTICULARLY THE ONES WHO DON'T HAVE. AN ARE IN AS AN UNDERDOG- AND FOREST AREAS OF THE STATE THE WHITE- URGE YOU PLEASE SUPPORT VOTE ON. THE. FIVE FIVE. THANKS DODD FOR THE BILL.

THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MCGUIRE VICE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE BACK IN SACRAMENTO AND TO BE STANDING. BY SENATOR DODD SOCIALLY DISTANCE AS WE ARE. TO EXPRESS VERIZON'S AND THE INDUSTRIES. AND THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AS STRONG SUPPORT. FOR THIS LEGISLATION WHICH WILL ACCELERATE AND EXPAND. FIVE G. CONNECTIVITY ACROSS CALIFORNIA- THE SENATOR LAID OUT VERY WELL WHAT THE BILL DOES- I THOUGHT I WOULD SPEND A FEW MOMENTS- PUTTING IN CONTEXT OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY. AND THEN A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT THE BILL DOES NOT DO- THIS BILL UP HOLDS FCC REGULATIONS AND LONG STANDING TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY. ABOUT HOW WE BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND GET THAT BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE CRITICALLY OVER THE LAST MILE WHICH IS ALWAYS BEEN THE QUINTESSENTIAL PROBLEM IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY HOW DO WE GET THIS BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. TO THE LAST MILE. AND SO THIS BILL WILL BRING CALIFORNIA CITIES AND COUNTIES INTO COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS THAT WERE ADOPTED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN BY THE FCC. THAT REQUIRE THAT PROHIBITS LOCALITIES FROM DENYING REASONABLE NON DISCRIMINATORY AND COST BASED ACCESS TO THEIR POLL INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR SMALL WIRELESS FACILITIES ATTACHMENT THESE SMALL CELLS ARE CRITICAL FOR DEPLOYING FIVE G. TECHNOLOGY IN CALIFORNIA- I CAN ADDRESS FIVE G. IN QUESTIONS OF THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL IT'S THE NEXT GENERATION OF WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY GIGABIT LEVEL CONNECTIVITY. EXTREMELY HIGH CAPACITY AND VERY VERY LOW LATENCY IT'S CALLED THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BUT I THINK THE KILLER APP. EVERYONE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT FOR FIVE G. IS SIMPLY BROADBAND GETTING MORE BROADBAND TO OUR HOMES AND SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. THE SENATOR WENT THROUGH A BIT ABOUT WHAT THE BILL DOES AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS- THAT THE CHAIR ALLOWS ME TO TAKE- BUT THAT THE SENATOR NOTED THAT WE THAT HE HAS TAKEN NUMEROUS AMENDMENTS. TO ADDRESS CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT- I STAKEHOLDERS- JUST A COUPLE TO POINT OUT THIS BILL RETAINS ALL LOCAL CONTROL AND AUTHORITY OVER SAFETY. THE PLACEMENT OF THESE SMALL CELLS AND AESTHETICS THIRTY SECONDS- THE BILL HAS A GRANDFATHERING CLAUSE TO PRESERVE EXISTING AGREEMENTS AN EXISTING DEPLOYMENTS. AND FINALLY I WOULD SAY THAT- THE PROBLEM OF DIGITAL DIVIDE IS REALLY A THREE LEGGED STOOL ACCESS AFFORDABILITY AND ADOPTION THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE FIRST CRITICAL ASPECT OF THAT OTHER BILLS THAT WILL COME BEFORE YOU WILL ADDRESS OTHER ASPECTS LIKE PERMIT STREAMLINING AND AFFORDABILITY THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THE HONOR TO SPEAK TODAY MR CAMERON AND MR VICE CHAIRMAN.

SIX WELL WE SHARE THE INTEREST IN INSURING ALL CALIFORNIANS ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF THE PANTS WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE. SENATE BILL FIVE FIVE. SIX FAILED TO ADVANCE THIS GOAL AND WOULD PERMANENTLY UNDERMINE EFFORTS BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ACHIEVE. CRITICAL DIGITAL EQUITY OBJECTIVES. SENATE BILLS FIFTY SIX IS FINDINGS POINT TO THE IMPORTANCE OF BROADBAND INTERNET FOR A VARIETY OF EQUITY RELATED REASONS CONCERNING ACCESS TO EDUCATION TO ALLOW WOMEN CLIMATE. UNFORTUNATELY AS EXPLAINED BY THE COMMITTEE STAFFS EXCELLENT RECORD THE BILL IMPOSES NEW OBLIGATIONS ON PROVIDES NO INCENTIVES. FOR WIRELESS CARRIERS DURING IN LEARNING OVER- A- TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE SO TO LOW AND CAN. THE FUND DIGITAL EQUITY SUPPORT PROVIDE ANY OTHER PUBLIC BENEFITS. YES FIVE FIFTY TWO PERMITS TIME CALIFORNIA TO ACCOUNT AT LEAST ORDER BY THE FORMER S. C. AS- THE BILL WILL MEAN THIS EVEN THAT. YES HE ORDER WERE BY THE CAR FC OF BY SUPREME COURT OR THE SUBJECT OF NEW CHARTER LEGISLATION. WHEN YOUR WAS ADOPTED THE CURRENT- CHAIR OF THE FCC. READ A STRONG. CENTER IN PART SUPPORTING LOCAL EFFORTS TO ADDRESS DIGITAL EQUITY. RECOMMENDED THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL BE SUNSET YOU'RE GOING TO BE UP TO SEE CHANGES IT'S INTERPRETATION OF FEDERAL LAW UNDER LINE. FEDERAL LAWS CHANGED OR THE SUPREME COURT REVERSES EUGENE. FURTHERMORE WHILE- SB FIVE FIFTY SIX. NEARLY I'M TRYING GENERAL REQUIREMENTS CREATED BY THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AT CC ORDER IMPOSES A GREATER BURDEN ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE DAM THAT ORDER- AND HERE'S SOME SPECIFIC CONCERNS IT WOULD REDUCE THE SHOT CLOCK FOR PROVING REQUEST REPLACEMENT OF YOUR WIRELESS FACILITIES. FROM SIXTY DAYS THE FORTY FIVE DAYS REQUESTING SURE THAN THREE HUNDRED POLLS. WOULD REQUIRE. LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO. BASICALLY APPROVE ALL OF HOLDS- JOKES A CUMBER FOR EXCLUDING THEM YOU CAN THAT THERE SO I DON'T STATE THREATS THIRTY CLASSES OF POOR- THANKS IT PROPOSES A CAR THAT THAT DOES NOT OCCUR.

GROUP HOMES THAT WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT HE'S HERE IN PERSON TODAY. AGAIN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL WE FIRST HAD OUR SUPPORT WITNESS ON THE PHONE OUR FIRST WITNESS- IN OPPOSITION WAS ON THE PHONE AND THEN WE HAVE IN PERSON WITNESSES HERE IN ROOM FORTY TWO A THREE BOTH IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION. MR GRAMM WE WELCOME YOU SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION OF SB FIVE FIVE SIX WILL HAVE YOU COME RIGHT UP TO THE PLEXIGLAS SHIELD YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES SIR AND I'LL GIVE YOU A. THIRTY SECOND FROM THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND SENATORS MARKRAM ON BEHALF OF KEEP CELL ANTENNAS AWAY. IN BEHALF OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. PLEASE ASK ME QUESTIONS AFTER THAT MY PRESENTATION HAPPY EARTH DAY SENATORS. ACCORDING TO THE BILL'S ANALYSIS THE AUTHORS CLAIMS ABOUT THIS BILL ARE NOT TRUE AS THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER SAID PAGE SEVEN SECTIONS TWO ONE THREE. THIS BILL WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ONE CRISIS TO CREATE ANOTHER. THE PRESENT SYSTEM IS WORKING. TELECOM COMPANIES ARE APPLYING FOR CELL ANTENNA PERMITS AND CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE ISSUING THOSE PERMITS ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THE SAFE WAY TO PROVIDE WIRELESS HIGH SPEED INTERNET ACCESS THAT IS FASTER MORE RELIABLE MORE SECURE AND MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT IF WITH FIBER OPTIC CABLES TO THE HOME OR OFFICE. THAT'S WHAT THE STATE SHOULD BE BEHIND. THIS BILL WOULD GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE STATE HUGE LIABILITY FOR INJURIES CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO HAZARDOUS MICROWAVE CELL ANTENNA RADIATION. THAT'S ACCORDING TO ATTORNEY JERRY LIMON I REFER TO MR LEEMANS LETTER TO THE ENERGY COMMITTEE DATED. APRIL FOURTEENTH. THE LIABILITY WOULD ATTACH TO LEGAL THEORIES THE DOCTRINE OF FIXTURES AND JOINT VENTURE SHIP. CITIES AND COUNTIES WOULD BECOME UNWILLING PARTNERS OF THE TELECOM COMPANIES. HERE'S THE BIG PICTURE SENATORS MANY CALIFORNIANS HAVE WOKEN UP TO SUDDENLY FIND THE CELL ANTENNA MOUNTED ON THE STREET LIGHT POLE OR UTILITY POLE IN FRONT OF THEIR HOUSE. THE CELL ANTENNA EXPOSES THEM TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS MICROWAVE RADIATION. THEY SUFFER FROM CONSTANT HEADACHES INSOMNIA AND RINGING IN THE EARS. MANY ARE LITERALLY DRIVEN OUT OF THEIR HOMES FORCED TO SELL AND MOVE. WE RELY ON OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PREVENT THIS. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF NINETEEN NINETY SIX. THIRTY SEVEN U. S. C. SECTION THREE THREE TWO SEVEN EIGHT AND THE FCC ORDERS CURRENTLY PRESERVE LOCAL ZONING AUTHORITY. HAS RECENTLY CONVERTED CONFIRMED BY US. FIVE COURT APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT IN THE CASE OF CITY OF PORTLAND V. UNITED STATES. THIS BILL WOULD ELIMINATE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT POWER TO DO THAT. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE LOCAL GO TO SUBSIDIZE THE INDUSTRY. ARE YOU WILLING TO SUBSIDIZE UNDER OTHER INDUSTRIES EQUALLY. SENATORS HERE'S AN EXPERIMENT FOR ONE WEEK TURN OFF YOUR WIFI AND YOUR CELL PHONE AT NINE. YOU WILL SLEEP BETTER AND HAVE MORE ENERGY THE NEXT DAY. THAT WILL BE YOUR PROOF THAT THE WIFI AND CELL PHONE RADIATION HAS BEEN HARMING YOU. CITIES MUST RETAIN THE ABILITY TO COMPATIBILITY TO IMPLEMENT REASONABLE BALANCED PROTECTIVE AND FAIR ORDINANCES AND AGREEMENTS SUCH AS THOSE IMPLEMENTED IN THE CITY OF ELK GROVE. MILL VALLEY PALUMA FAIRFAX IN SENATORS. VOLATILE AND OTHERS IN ORDER TO PROTECT PUBLIC FACILITIES AND ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC AND UNIQUE NEEDS OF A LOCAL COMMUNITY. THERE'VE BEEN THOUSANDS OF STUDIES SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THAT HAVE SHOWN LONG TERM EXPOSURE TO NON IONIZING MICROWAVE RADIATION CREATES MANY HEALTH HAZARDS REFER TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH STUDY FROM NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. THE INTERNATIONAL EMF SCIENTIST APPEAL FROM MAY OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THIRTY SECONDS WHICH SAID THAT THIS RADIATION CAUSES LEARNING AND MEMORY DEFICITS AND STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL CHANGES OF THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM. THERE WAS A SIMILAR RESOLUTION BY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN. THIS IS WHAT THE STATE SHOULD MAKE IT A PRIORITY. NOW THERE IS AN OVERRIDING STATE INTEREST HERE AND IT'S NOT THE END PUTTING CELL ANTENNAS ON FRONT OF IN FRONT OF PEOPLE'S HOMES. EIGHT OF STREET LIGHT POLE OR UTILITY POLE IS A TERRIBLE PLACE FOR A CELL ANTENNA. THE STATE INTEREST HERE THE COMPELLING STATE INTEREST IS TO THE PRESERVATION AND PROTECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR ASK YOU TO COMPLETE YOUR- IN THE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO LEAVE THE POWER CURRENTLY LIES AND THAT'S IN THE HANDS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. I URGE YOU TO VOTE NOW AND THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH INSTAGRAM- AND WE WELCOME YOU AS YOU SAID THE STATE IF YOU IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. MISTER GRAHAM WILL BE WITH US WE MISTER RAISES WELL ON THE SUPPORT SIDE- SO BOTH ARE HERE TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS A COMMITTEE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME.

ALL RIGHT LET'S GO TO CENTER WINNER PLEASE I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND- AND- YOU KNOW THIS. THIS IS ALWAYS A HARD ISSUE AND FOR THOSE OF US WHO SERVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. HE FOUR AND ANOTHER A FEW OF US HERE THESE ARE SOME OF THE MOST CONTENTIOUS. FIGHTS THAT WE WOULD HAVE IN TERMS OF THE CITING OF- OF CELL SITES IN INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE- AND WE WOULD HAVE APPEALS- AT THE- FORTY SUPERVISORS RIGHT SIR WE WOULD. I WAS IN VARIOUS COMMUNITY MEETINGS WHERE WE WILL BING NEIGHBORS TOGETHER AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE PURPOSE CITING SO IT'S NOT OUTSIDE OF SOMEONE'S. BEDROOM FOR EXAMPLE. WHICH IS ALWAYS HARD ISSUES AND IT'S ALSO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE INTERNET IS AN INTERNET BROADBAND ACCESS INTERNET ACCESS IS AT THE HEART OF. SO MUCH OF MODERN SOCIETY FOR BETTER FOR WORSE AND THIS PANDEMIC HAS CERTAINLY- CERTAINLY- REMINDED US OF THAT AND I FEEL VERY FORTUNATE THAT- YOU KNOW IN MY- HOME I HAVE REALLY YOU KNOW STRONG- INTERNET ACCESS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE HAD I HAD CRUDDY- YOU KNOW BROADBAND ACCESS. DURING THIS PANDEMIC IN PARTICULAR AND I KNOW THAT TRAGICALLY THERE ARE A HUGE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS WHO DO FRANKLY HAVE CRUDDY. BROADBAND ACCESS IT IS VERY VERY DAMAGING IN TERMS OF WHETHER IT'S REMOTE LEARNING OR- HELP PEOPLE WORK OR ANY OF THE OTHER MANY WAYS OF PEOPLE RELY ON THE INTERNET FOR. ESSENTIAL SO WE'RE TRYING TO STRIKE THIS BALANCE- TO SAY WE NEED TO KEEP BUILDING OUT THIS INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE SO MANY SWATHS. OF CALIFORNIA DO HAVE BAD ACCESS. WHILE ALSO- YOU KNOW- PLACE AND ASCETICS IN SAFETY. AND EQUITY AND SO FORTH- SO THIS BILL I THINK YOU NEED SOME MORE WORK- BUT I THINK IT'S HEADED IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION- AND I CAN KNOWLEDGE OF MY OWN CITY IS OPPOSED TO IT I RESPECT THAT BUT I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD TODAY- I DO THINK THAT SOME OF THE ENERGY COMMITTEE MEMBERS WAS I GUESS WE'RE TAKING. OFFICIALLY IN THIS COMMITTEE- ARE POSITIVE THAT WHEN THIS ONE CENTER HUESO OUT OF A MUCH BROADER VERSION OF THIS BILL. THREE YEARS AGO. I KNOW I AM CENTER MCGUIRE AND OTHERS HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT LOCAL ABILITY TO MANDATE THE RIGHT DESIGN AND AESTHETICS OR NOT BEING- DOWNED YOU KNOW IT IF THE IF THE CITY SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT WE KNOW YOU WANT US ALSO BUT WE DON'T WANT ON THIS POLL WE WANT ON THIS POLE ACROSS THE STREET. HAVING THAT KIND OF FLEXIBILITY AND I THINK THIS BILL DOES PROVIDE- AND AMENDMENTS I THINK. HELP TO CLARIFY THAT AND STRENGTHEN. BY THAT I DO- YOU KNOW WANT TO MAKE SURE THE CITIES HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY. GOING FORWARD- I AM- SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE- CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO REYES I HOPE CENTER YOU'LL GOING TO SIT DOWN WITH. THE FOLK FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO TALK THROUGH. THE DETAILS PARTICULARLY AROUND ON EQUITY AND I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE- MAKE SURE THAT. THIS IS NOT JUST BEING BUILT ON WEALTHIER AREAS THAT WE'RE TRULY BENEFITING LOWER INCOME AREAS RURAL CALIFORNIA- CAN ALSO. A SAFETY AND I KNOW THAT SAN FRANCISCO'S REYES OF MEDIA SHOW TRAFFIC SIGNALS AND THOSE POLLS SOMETIMES NOT BEING APPROPRIATE. FOR CELL SITES AND I KNOW THERE IS A PROCESS OF THE BILL OF A- CITY BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A SAFETY ISSUE. BECAUSE TRAFFIC SIGNALS OF COURSE FOR FIRST AND FOREMOST ABOUT TRAFFIC AND PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. MAKING. SURE THAT THAT PROCESS WORKS. TOP CITIES THAT'S I WOULD I. YOU TO. YOU KNOW- UGH UGH CHAT WITH HER ABOUT THAT AN- ABOUT TODAY ALL TO MOVE THIS FOR AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE FLOOR ALL THE- AT THE BILL TO SEE WHERE WE ARE AT ALL THE SIDE HELD IT ON THE FLOOR- SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND WIENER AT CONCERN OVER TO CENTER DOT TO BE TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THOSE I REQUEST- IS WELLS COMMENTS PLEASE CENTER DIED. GOD HELP YOU TO TALK TO ANYBODY AND EVERYBODY- PARTICULARLY ABOUT DIGITAL EQUITY BENEFITS. IT'S REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE AT THE BEGINNING IT WAS ALL ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL. IT JUST NOW LATELY AFTER TAKING MOST OF THESE AMENDMENTS. NOW THAT. THE TOPIC AT HAND SEEMS TO BE DIGITAL EQUITY WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I- TALK TO SENATOR DORADO ABOUT- THIS MORNING HAPPY TO TALK TO THEM. I THINK THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE GOING FORWARD I'M HAPPY TO. CHANGE THE FOCUS- TO DIGITAL EQUITY BUT ALSO AT THE SAME TIME WORKING WITH LOCAL PUBLIC WORKS. AGENCIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR NEEDS ARE TAKEN CARE OF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER DATA LIKE TO GO TO THE VICE CHAIR THAN TO CENTER DRAWS OF MISTER VICE CHAIR. THE GRIFFIN OBSERVATION THE PAID A BIT OF A PICTURE OF WHAT THE SENATORS. PROGRESSING WITH. THAT DOESN'T MESH TO. APPLY TO SMALL COULD. THIS VERY TINY SCHOOL IN WESTERN TO HAMMOCK. BUT DOES. FEW YEARS AGO DISTURB CAME FUND THE SCHOOL WHEN IT WAS IN FACT. HE PREVIOUSLY HAD SHOT. A WOMAN IN A CAR THEN CAME TO ASSAULT THE SCHOOL INTENT ON HARMING THE CHILDREN. IT'S JUST SAY IT WAS TAKEN CARE OF AND ONLY ONE CHILD GOT WOUNDED BUT- ONE OTHER PERSON WAS KILLED. THE POINT OF BEING. WE ARE NOT IN THAT VERY RURAL AREA HAD ACCESS. TWO CELLPHONES. AND IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T MAKE SENSE FOR COMPANIES TO PUT ANYTHING OUT THERE. WITH THE COOPERATION OF A LOCAL PHONE COMPANY AND AT AND T. WE WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THAT CONNECTIVITY. AND THAT FURTHER THAN HAD LATER APPLICATION ON A HUGE FIRE CAME THROUGH THAT SAME AREA SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT LIFE HEALTH AND SAFETY HERE TOO. ALBEIT AND RURAL AREAS BUT THE SHOULD BUT BASS IS ACCESSIBILITY HELP THOSE AREAS NOT ONLY SAVE LIFE AND PROPERTY BUT ALSO TO PROSPER ECONOMICALLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH INTEREST YOUR APPRECIATE YOU BRING THAT FORWARD I CENTER DIED ANY ITEMS YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO FROM THE VICE CHAIR BEFORE WE GO TO SENATOR RAZA- NO I THINK HE MADE HIS POINT VERY CLEAR. AND I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU THANKYOU SO MUCH CENTER DIED CENTER DRAWS A GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU- VERY MUCH- AS THE AUTHORS SAID- IS IT THE ISSUE OF ACCESS IS SOMETHING THAT I HAVE RAISED- I RECOGNIZE THE GOALS OF THE AUTHOR AS FAR AS THE INVESTMENT THAT'S NEEDED IN THIS INDUSTRY IN OUR COMMUNITIES BUT- ACCESS IS. OF THE THREE THAT I THINK THE MR RUDY. VETERANS WITH SERVICE- MENTIONED BUT- REMOTE LEARNING HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH ACCESS TELEHEALTH ACCESS TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM- A LOT OF SO MANY THINGS HAVE NOW COME UP THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE STARTING TO DEVELOP A WHOLE LOT MORE BUT EVERY TIME THE TECHNOLOGY COMES UP THERE'S ALWAYS A DOWNSIDE BECAUSE OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT OR LEFT BEHIND AND SO WE CANNOT MOVE FORWARD AS FAST AS WE WANT ON TELEHEALTH BECAUSE SO MANY COMMUNITIES DON'T HAVE THAT ACCESS THE SAME THING GOES THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM ARE RUNNING AHEAD. HERE AND THEY'RE STILL PEOPLE BEING LEFT BEHIND I LIVE IN LOS ANGELES AND I HAVE A PLACE TO SACRAMENTO IN BOTH I HAVE WE GET ACCESS. IT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT NOT ONLY OUR RURAL AREAS SO WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING- THAT STRONG SO I SUPPORT THIS BILL FOR THAT REASON HOWEVER. I WOULD ALSO WANT TO ASK YOU TO HONE IN ON THE ISSUE OF EQUITABLE ACCESS. IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO- SAY WE'RE GOING TO INVEST ACROSS THE BOARD THERE ARE COMMUNITIES THAT NEEDED. ALMOST AND- WHEN WE SAY HARDEST HIT- DURING THE PANDEMIC IT WAS CERTAINLY THOSE COMMUNITIES AND IT DOES. IT THE PART THAT. CONCERNS ME IS THAT IF WE TAKE AWAY AS MUCH AS WE ARE- IN TERMS OF- ABILITY TO RAISE THE ISSUES FROM THE LOCAL AREAS. THAT MEAN WE LOSE THE ABILITY THE LEVERAGE WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT TO BE ABLE TO. GET THESE COMMUNITIES THE INVESTMENT THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO COME ALONG AS MUCH AS EVERYBODY ELSE'S SO I REALLY LOOK FOR A CLEARER- INCLUSION OF THAT IN THE BILL AND SO- AND I APPRECIATE THAT. THE SAFETY ISSUES ARE IN THE HANDS OF THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS RIGHT. YES OKAY SO. THAT'S WHAT I ASK OF YOU AND THE- AND THE PROVIDERS THAT WERE IN THIS CONVERSATION WITH THANK YOU THANK YOU- PLEASE CENTER DRAWS- APPRECIATE THAT- YOU'VE GOT MY COMMITMENT THAT THAT. WILL BE WORKING ON IT I WOULD LIKE HISTORY IS TO. COMMENT ON THAT THOSE TO SEE- WHAT THAT THEY MAY HAVE IN STORE AS WE SIT HERE AT THIS COMMITTEE HEARING TODAY.

TO EVERYONE WHO'S CALLED IN TODAY FOR THOSE HAVE BEEN WAITING ON THE LINES WE JUST CAN'T SAY THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR GRATEFUL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY FOR YOUR FEEDBACK TODAY WE APOLOGIZE IT OUT WE COULDN'T GET TO EVERYONE WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING. YOUR COMMENTS IN WRITING AT THE COMMITTEE WEBSITE ALL RIGHT LAYS IN GENERAL WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO TO COMMENTS IN THAT START WITH OUR MAJORITY LEADER COMMENTS QUESTIONS CONCERNS- CENTERS FOR. I'M NOT GETTING LIKE. THIRTIES THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN ON- CENTER WINNER IF THE CITY OF BAKERSFIELD. NEXT WEEK WHETHER THROUGH ORDINANCE OR THEY SHOULD'VE DECIDED TO ADOPT A- POLICY SIMILAR TO WHAT'S CONTAINED IN SB TEN. WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE CITY OF BAKERSFIELD TO ADOPT AN ORDINANCE TO ZONE A PARTIAL FOR UP TO TEN UNITS IN THE TRANSIT RICH AREAS JOB CHERRY URBAN INFILL SITE BECAUSE THEY DO SO. THE GROUP WHICH TODAY COULD I DO SO YEAH. HI YES YES ABSOLUTELY IT WOULD BE A MUCH LENGTHIER AND MORE EXPENSIVE PROCESS FOR THEM TO DO IT BUT- YOU COULD DO IT. IF THEY COULD DO IT- BUT NOT IN THE SAME WAY. NOT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE THE EXPEDITED. PROCESS THAT SB TEN WILL PROVIDE THE NEW VOLUNTARY PROCESS. OKAY YOU KNOW I A FEW WELL KNOWN WE HAD LONG DISCUSSIONS ON THE SENATOR. YOU ARE ONE BRIGHT FELLA. BUT I WAS NOT SOMEBODY WHO WAS SUPPORTIVE OF- SB FIFTY LAST YEAR AND THE REASON I DIDN'T DO IT WAS BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT IT DESTROYED AS I SAID IN MY FOR STATEMENT SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS AND I BELIEVE THAT. THERE'S  VALUE TO SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS I THINK THEY'RE IMPORTANT PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS TO LIVE IN SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS. AND I THINK THAT ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SOMEWHAT OF A CHALLENGE PRETTY URGENT CHALLENGE WITH RESPECT TO HOUSING SUPPLY. THE QUESTION IS DO WE NEED TO DESTROY BECAUSE BASICALLY BY GOING TO TEN UNITS OF MY BLOCK AND STATE BAN EYES. AND I COULD BUILD TEN UNITS ON MY BLOCK WOULD FUNDAMENTALLY IN MY JUDGMENT. AND I KNOW MY NEIGHBORS JUDGMENTS DESTROY THE CHARACTER OF MY NEIGHBORHOOD- AND SO- ALL OF A SUDDEN THOSE WOULD NO LONGER BE ASSUMING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MADE THOSE QUESTIONS. AND SO FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL STANDPOINT YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT THE ARGUMENT WITH RESPECT TO S. B. TEN VERSES SB FIFTY IN MY VIEW. IS THE VOLUNTARY NATURE OF IT IT'S LIKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVING. A BILL THAT HAS SHARP TEETH OR DENTURES IT MIGHT IT MIGHT NOT. BE EASIER TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT BUT THE REALITY FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL STANDPOINT. I CAN'T VOTE FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE WHAT I'M TELLING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS. YOU COULD DESTROY A SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS SEEMS TO ME OF THE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND SQUARE MILES WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE NEED TO PRESERVE A GREAT DEAL OF IT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SPACE. THAT WE HAVE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES ESPECIALLY NOW WITH THE PANDEMIC THE BILLS WE HAVE HERE FOR ADAPTIVE RE USE CERTAIN IN MY CITY I'M TRYING DESPERATELY WANT TO SUPPORT THOSE THINGS ALONG. VENTURA BOULEVARD IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WE CAN TURN THOSE INTO- LIVABLE UNITS I LIVED IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES AND- IN THE ARTS DISTRICT INTO OVER HOUSE WHERE WE DID ADAPTIVE RE USE THAT WORK PRETTY BRILLIANTLY EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN DOWNTWN LOS ANGELES. UP UNTIL THE PANDEMIC WE'RE PRETTY BRILLIANTLY- THE CABALLERO MEASURE WHICH SAYS WITH THESE BUILDINGS THAT WE HAVE LOST BECAUSE OF. THE PANDEMIC OF THE DE CHANGE THE ECONOMY WHICH HER. FORMER- OFFICE BUILDING OR OFF PARK OR SHOPPING CENTERS TO CONVERT THOSE TOGETHER WAS CENTER PORTANTINO'S MEASURE TO FIGURE FUNDING MECHANISM. THE REALITY IS. MANY JUST DON'T SEE THAT WERE IN A POSITION IN A SOCIETY WHERE WE HAVE TO SAY. WE HAVE TO GET RID OF SINGLE FAMILY AND IT GIVE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES I FIGHT FOR THAT VALUE I THINK THAT VALUES IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT. IS IT IS PART OF THE CALIFORNIA DREAM. AND YOU KNOW IF YOU MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE READ IN THE OP ED PIECE THAT I WROTE ABOUT BUILDING HOMES. AND BUILDING HOMEOWNERSHIP. IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOLKS SO. EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A BILL WITH DENTURES AS OPPOSED TO SHARP TEETH IS ONE WORD I AS I TRY TO CHARACTERIZE IT BECAUSE- IT'S A VOLUNTARY. IT'S VOLUNTARY OF A PHILOSOPHY THAT I JUST DON'T SUPPORT. SO I READ THIS THING A COUPLE OF TIMES. LISTEN A LOT TO YOUR POINTS OF VIEW AND I TRIED TO BRING MYSELF TO IT. I REMEMBER SO LAST POINT TALKING TO CONGRESSMAN CARGOES IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN WE HAD THE DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY. AND THEN HE INITIALLY NOTICED THAT MUCH FASTER THAN WHAT HAPPENED IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH SPEAKER PELOSI. THEN MINORITY LEADER PELOSI I THINK IT WAS- BECAUSE HE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES OR GOOD FOR. ON FIRST RUNNERS. AND I JUST I THINK WE'RE DURING A POSSIBLE CANCER SUPPORT BONUS SHIP. AND TO ALLOW PEOPLE HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY SO. WITH THIS HAS T. THROUGH THIS VOLUNTARY NOT. IT'S INDICATIVE OF A PHILOSOPHY. THAT I CAN'T EMBRACE AND THAT BASICALLY SAYS THAT WE ARE GOING TO. AS A GOVERNMENT. CREATE AN INCENTIVIZE AND EXPEDITE AWAY TO DESTROY A SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH I THINK ARE CRITICAL SO. EIGHT I KNOW YOU'RE A THOUGHTFUL PERSON AND I DON'T MEAN TO BE DISRESPECTFUL IN ANY WAY. I'M JUST TELLING YOU SOMETIMES EVEN MY OWN FAMILY WE CAN'T AGREE AND I JUST IT'S JUST NO WAY I CAN SUPPORT THIS. BECAUSE IT IS SO ANTITHETICAL TO WHAT I THINK IS SO IMPORTANT TO AN ELEMENT OF OUR SOCIETY SO AS TO ENSURE THOSE THOUGHTS WITH YOU- MISTER WINNER. THANK YOU SO MUCH IS THE MAJORITY LEADER CENTER WINNER WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND OR TO GO TO SANTA ROSA SURE THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS- MR MAJORITY LEADER- AND THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING THE SENSE OF THE SAME BILL. LAST YEAR WHICH IS SENATE PASSED ON. OVERWHELMINGLY. I YOU KNOW I I'VE- YOU KNOW. I JUST HAVE TO. TAKE ISSUE AND- WITH YOU YOU KNOW WHAT I AND I. I WILL JUST EXPRESS IN WITH SB FIFTY. WE WERE TOLD OVER AND OVER AGAIN. TELL YOUR FORCING CITIES TO DO SOMETHING YOUR FORCING IT YOU'RE TAKING THAT ABILITY. AWAY FOR CITIES TO MAKE THEIR OWN THEIR OWN DECISION WE SHOULD. INSTEAD BE YOU KNOW IT PEOPLE SAID DON'T TO THE STICK. TO THE CARROT. GIVE TOOLS GIVE POWER TO CITIES EMPOWER CITIES YOU KNOW WHAT YOU YOU KNOW YOU BRING KNOWLEDGE. THAT WE HAVE A DEEP HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE NEED MORE HOUSING YOU AND I CAN AGREE ON THAT. AND WE WERE TOLD WITH SB FIFTY INSTEAD OF LIKE YOU KNOW TO USING THE STICK TO TELL CITIES WHAT TO DO. GIVE THEM TOOLS GIVEN THE CARROT GIVEN THE POWER EMPOWER CITIES TO SOLVE THIS DEEP TERRIBLE CRISIS. AND WE WERE TOLD FIFTY FIFTY- THIS IS ONE SIZE FITS ALL I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT ARGUMENT BECAUSE IT REALLY WASN'T BUT- THAT WAS THE ARGUES ONE SIZE FITS ALL. AND CITY SHOULD HAVE THE POWER TO TAILOR THE RESPONSE IN THEIR OWN WAY. WHILE I. LISTEN THAT I HEARD THAT. BUT THOSE SENTIMENTS AND THAT'S WHY I INTRODUCED. LAST YEAR'S VERSION OF US. THE TIME SB NINE OH TWO. BECAUSE THAT'S- WHAT IT DOES. IT IS SORT OF A CARROT AND THE EMPOWERING OF CITIES THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO IT ALL. BUT WHAT WE'RE SAYING FOR THE CITIES THAT ARE INTERESTED IN DOING. A REZONING AND MIGHT JUST BE ON THEIR MAIN CORRIDOR OR MIGHT BE IN ONE PART OF THE CITY OR MIGHT THEY MIGHT JUST. NOT WANT TO DO IT ANYWHERE. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THEIR LIVES EASIER IN DOING THAT INSTEAD OF JUST TELLING CITIES. PLEASE ZONE FOR MORE HOUSING. LET'S GIVE THEM A TOOL TO DO IT SO. HERE THIS THIS THIS LEGISLATION DOES NOT IN ANY WAY GET RID OF SINGLE FAMILY ZONING THERE ARE OTHER BILLS. THAT DO THAT THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM. CITIES CAN DECIDE. WHEN I HAVE NO SINGLE FAMILY ZONING. THEY CAN DECIDE IF THEY WANT TO IN 90% OF THEIR CITY OR IN 50% OF THOSE CITY CITIES CAN DO WHAT THEY WANT AND THAT'S WHAT S. B. TEN- IS ABOUT I WOULDN'T CALL IT DENTURES- NO NO DISRESPECT TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE DENTURES IT IS IT IS A TRULY A CARROT- AND EMPOWER MENT OF CITIES. TO DO WHAT MANY CITIES WHAT TO DO AND TO SAY IF YOU WANT TO ALSO IN CERTAIN AREAS AND YOU'RE DOING IT IN A NON SPRAWL WAY PRICE TO DOING IT AND FILL IN YOUR JOB YOUR TRANSIT NOT SPRAWL- YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO A FIVE TO TEN YEAR PROCESS- TO DO IT SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE- AND I THINK IT'S A SOLID BILL AND I THINK IT DESERVES YOUR SUPPORT. YOU CAN ITEMS CHALLENGES RICHARD IS A LITTLE BIT HERE BACK AND FORTH YEAH SUPPORT ISSUE IT IS BUT SENATOR WINNER TO DISCUSS THIS. AND I AGREE WITH YOU TO TOOL. BUT SOMETIMES IT AND THAT'S- STAY. WILL PUT. AND THIS IS WHY. IT AS IT RELATES ISSUES I THOUGHT ABOUT IT. THAT THAT CONCERNS ME BECAUSE- YOU KNOW IT'S A TOOL THAT I WOULD USE YOU'RE RIGHT WE SHOULD GIVE TOOLS TO CREATE A HOUSING AND CENTER PORTANTINO HAS A MEASURE. WANTS TO REIMBURSE CITIES BECAUSE WE HAVE BRADLEY BURNS AND WE HAVE THIS FISCAL POSITION OF THE ID'S AND HE'S TRYING TO USE A TOOL TO BE ABLE TO INCENT SHOPPING CENTERS. AND OFFICE PARKS TO TURN INTO HOUSING AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT'S A TOOL THAT I SUPPORT. I DON'T I MEAN IT'S LIKE WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH POLICING WE'RE WE'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE GUN IS A TOOL YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE A TASER OR DIFFERENT KIND OF A BILLY CLUB. TO ME THE ARGUMENT YOU MAKE IS COMPLETELY FAIR WE NEED TOOLS THAT WE HAVE CHALLENGES. ONLY MAKE TWO OBSERVATIONS IN THAT REGARD HEY THIS IS NOT A TOOL I WOULD USE BECAUSE THE POWER OF THE STATE IS EXTRAORDINARY. AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S A TOOL IT MAKES A STATEMENT THROUGH THE BACK DOOR ABOUT IT'S OKAY TO BUILD TEN UNITS ON A TEN THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT LOT. IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMEBODY'S NEIGHBORHOOD AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE POLITICS AND THE INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO DEVELOP THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS AND WILL PAY FOR POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS. AND BE ABLE TO MAKE ARGUMENTS FIRST AS THE PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS THE DISPARITY OF POWER IS SO GREAT SO THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMEBODY'S GOT TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS DEVELOPER IN MY CITY PUTS A MEASURE ON THE BALLOT BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALLOWED BECAUSE WE AS A STATE HAVE SENT THAT. WE THEY WILL USE THE ARGUMENT THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAYS THIS IS A GOOD AN APPROPRIATE TOOL SO THERE ARE A TOTAL NUMBER OF TOOLS WE CAN USE TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF BOTH CREATING SUPPLY WHICH IS WHAT I'M WORKING ON WITH MY SELF LIQUIDATING. BOND ISSUE THAT I'M WORKING ON FOR AWHILE. AND CREE A HALF OF MY NEW YEAR. AS TO. IT IMPAC THE CORE OF WHAT NEIGHBORHOODS MIGHT LOOK LIKE. THERE COULD BE OTHER TOOLS IT COULD WORK. I JUST I DON'T LIKE THIS TOOL BECAUSE I THINK IT HAS ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES. AND I THINK IT'S AS THE POWER OF THE STATE. I THINK IT'S IT SENDS A MESSAGE THAT'S NOT CONSISTENT WITH MY CORE VALUES SO. JUST IF I COULD ADD THAT TO AND HAPPY TO LISTEN BUDDY I WANTED TO ENGAGE A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE THE SURCHARGE CONVERSATION. BY RICHARD SHERMAN WAY STE THAT'S TO BE CLEAR. WE TALK ABOUT THE POWER OF THE STATE. THIS IS THE STATE GETTING OUT OF THE WAY OF CITIES. IT'S A STATEMENT SAYING WE ARE GOING TO GET OUT OF YOUR WAY. AND LET YOU DO THIS IF YOU WANT TO AND THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN UNLESS THE CITY COUNCIL. OR COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. DECIDES TO DO IT. WE'RE NOT FORCING THE CITY COUNCIL IS A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO DO ANYTHING. THE ONLY IF THEY DECIDE TO DO IT AND- TEST IT WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING WITH THE DEVELOPER GOING TO THE BALLOT TO BY THE REZONING. THEY CAN DO HAT RIGHT NOW THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT THING. DIE IN THE BILL TO GO TO THE BALLOT WITH THE REZONING A DEVELOPER CAN DO THAT. TODAY AND THIS WON'T CHANGE THAT. SO I YOU KNOW I RESPECTFULLY MR MAJORITY LEADER- I JUST DON'T THINK THATTHE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE BILL- IS. RELATED TO WHAT THIS BILL ACTUALLY DOES IS A VOLUNTARY TOOLS. THAT CITIES CAN USE. OR THEY CAN IGNORE ENTIRELY. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER RETURNING ADDITIONAL IT YOU MAY. I THINK SO MUCH. OF IT'S GOING TO CENTER DRAWS OF CONNECTING. THANK YOU- I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE FROM THE START THAT I KNOWS SENATOR WE KNOW THE AUTHOR HAS. WORKS ON THIS DAY AND NIGHT ALL THE TIME TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT TO DO FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. I KNOW THAT THINKING ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS ALWAYS ON YOUR MIND AS WELL- I DON'T MIND USING THE POWER OF THE STATE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR WE'RE HERE AS- LEGISLATORS. FOR THE STATE. AND DO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THAT IN A MEANINGFUL WAY THE DOESN'T HURT PEOPLE. BUT DOES HELPS PEOPLE. AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES THAT YOU AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT WITH REGARDS TO THIS AND I'M HOPING. DURING THE TIME I WILL SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOU RESOLVING OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT. BUT I. I AM MOST CONCERNED WHEN THE HOUSING ISSUES COME UP IS. HOW IT IMPACTS- POOR WORKING POOR. WHO HAVE A VISION FOR THEIR FUTURE BUT FOR NOW AND FOR A WHILE THE RENTERS AND THEY JUST REALLY WANT TO BE SECURE IN SOME PLACE. AND NOT BE EVICTED- WHETHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THE CONDITIONS ARE SET UP FOR THAT- AND THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE OUR CRISIS. YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO WERE BUYING THEIR HOMES FOR THE MOST PART EXCEPT FOR THE- ECONOMIC CRISIS OF THE PANDEMIC. YOU KNOW THEY GOT A PLACE TO LIVE I'M TALKING ABOUT WHERE PEOPLE ARE ON THE EDGE OF BEING EVICTED ON THE EDGE. OF ANY EXCUSE TO GET THEM OUT SO THAT. YOU KNOW THOSE WHO CAN MAKE MONEY OFF OF WORKING POOR CAN CAN DO THAT SO I'M THAT'S WHERE I'M COMING FROM THAT'S WHERE MY DISTRICT I'M CONCERNED AND I DON'T HAVE JUST WORKING POOR IN MY DISTRICT I HAVE A LOT OF MIDDLE CLASS AND UPPER INCOME PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT BUT THAT'S WITH A CRISIS AND WE HAVE TO REALLY FACE THAT CRISIS HEAD ON SO. I APPRECIATE ALL ALL THAT YOU DO- ICE AS I SAID I WILL- SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY AND I HOPE THAT THE OTHER ISSUES ARE RESOLVED SO THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER DRESSES CENTER WIENER ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS YOU MAY HAVE FOR CERTAIN DRUGS NO I SORT OF DRUGS AND I REALLY ENJOYED AND APPRECIATED OUR CONVERSATION SUCH ABOUT THIS BILL BUT OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE I THINK YOU AND I ARE. ON VERY ALIGNED IN A LOT OF WAYS IN RECOGNIZING THE DEEP CRISIS. THAT PARTICULARLY OUR LOWEST INCOME RESIDENTS- IN TERMS OF BEING MARGINALLY HAL'S OR IN VERY OVERCROWDED- CONDITIONS AND THE REAL RISKS OF DISPLACEMENT AND THAT'S A VALUE THAT I HOLD. IN MY HEART THAT WE SHOULD NOT YEAH WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT I. PUT HOT HOUSING SHOULD BE ADDITIVE. ADDING TO WHAT WE HAVE AND NOT REPLACING THE PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE- AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY I KNOW YOU AND I'VE BEEN VERY ALIGNED PUSHING FOR MORE FUNDING- BUT ALSO AND YOU KNOW LEGISLATION SPECIFIC TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS SO. LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU AND I. REALLY APPRECIATE THAT PERSPECTIVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. BEFORE I COME IN I WANT TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO BE A NEW ADVANCE IS THERE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR. SOMEONE WILL MOTION BY SENATOR ALSO THANK YOU SO MUCH A MATTER SENATOR LOOK I'LL BE QUICK. CENTER WINNERS I KNOW THAT. WE'RE GETTING LATE IN CHORE HEARING. NUMBER ONE- AS WE SAID IN THIS PREVIOUS BILL WITH SB NINE. THERE ARE NO BILLS NO BILLS IS IN FRONT OF THIS LEGISLATION ARE EASY WHEN IT COMES HOUSING- RIGHTFULLY SO. HI EVERYONE CARES DEEPLY TERRY PERSONAL ABOUT THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH THEY CALL HOME. IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD IN WHICH THEY LIVE IN AND IT'S VERY PERSONAL FOR ALL OF US AS WELL. THE FACT IS THERE BEEN SEVERAL TIMES. I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS IN THE PAST. OF ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH IS WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING. SO NOW WHAT WE'RE SEEING ARE MORE STRATEGIC FOCUS BILLS ARE COMING FORWARD THEY CAN HELP MOVE THE NEEDLE IN BIG CITIES AND SMALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WHETHER IT'S THE ISSUE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH IS REALLY AT A DEEP CRISIS. FOR MARKET RATE HOUSING. FEW THINGS ON THIS BILL. NUMBER ONE BUT THIS BILL IS NOW. VOLUNTARY. IT'S VOLUNTARY EVERYONE. TO IF THE CITY DECIDES TO OPT INTO THIS BILL IT'S ULTIMATELY THE CITY COUNCIL OR THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS DECISION. IN THOSE INDIVIDUALS WOULD THEN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE- WHEN IT COMES TO VOTERS. AND IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL THAT'S THE ULTIMATE LOCAL CONTROL. NUMBER TWO ITS FOCUS ON INFILL- WE SHOULD BE DEVELOPING NOT ON GREENFIELD ON INFILL REVITALIZATION PROJECTS NUMBER THREE I'VE HEARD FOLKS CALLING ST WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT AFFORDABLE WELL WHAT THIS SAYS ABOUT AFFORDABLE IS THAT. IF THERE'S AN AFFORDABLE PROJECT OF UP TO TEN UNITS IT GETS THE STREAMLINED PROCESS. PERFORMER UNITS FOR WORKING FAMILIES FOR THOSE WHO ARE STRUGGLING BE ACHIEVED THE AMERICAN DREAM- AND I THINK THAT'S ALSO. IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE HEARD IS. SAID TIMES BILLS ARE TO FOCUS ON MARKET RATE IN ON AFFORDABLE IT GIVES THIS A MARKET RATE AND AFFORDABLE EQUAL TREATMENT WHICH I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT. AND THEN FINALLY WHAT I'LL SAY. IS THIS. IT IS ULTIMATELY UP TO CITY TO BE ABLE TO OPT INTO THIS- AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES GOOD AND BAD FOR CITY TO DEAL WITH I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTED TODAY AS CENTER WINNER IF YOU HAVE TAKEN IN LAST YEARS IN LAST YEAR'S ITERATION. PRETTY SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS WOULD WORK WITH HOUSING LEAD GROUP THAT HAD SOME VERY CRITICAL FEEDBACK AND I MEAN THAT INTERTRIGO COMPLETE BACK ON ME SHE THINKS I'M MISTAKEN IN THAT BUT I THINK YOU REALLY TOK IN THAT FEEDBACK I AM VERY VERY GRATEFUL.

AND CONVENES A VERY REALLY DIVERSE GROUP OF- OF MEMBERS WHO YOU KNOW WERE AND THE STRONGEST- WELL- SUPPORTERS OR OPPONENTS WHO WERE MORE YOU KNOW ME SENATORS A LITTLE BIT IN THE MIDDLE WHO AW BOTH SIDES- AND I THINK THAT WAS A REALLY POWERFUL PROCESS AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER A HOUSING PACKAGE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF SENATOR ATKINS S. B. TEN. IS PART OF SENATOR TONI ATKINS LEADERSHIP PACKAGE COMING OUT OF THE DIVERSE SENATE HOUSING WORKING GROUP AND I'M REALLY APPRECIATIVE TO HAVE HAD THIS BILL INCLUDED- AND- YOU KNOW AND IT'S A IT'S A STRONG PACKAGE AND OF COURSE WE KNOW LAST YEAR FOR REASONS UNRELATED TO HOUSING- SOME OF THE HOUSE ISSUES THAT POP UP FROM TIME TO TIME WE HAD A TUMULTUOUS.

I INDICATED TO THE AUTHOR THAT ARE WOULD BE VOTING FOR THE BILL AT THIS TIME. I ALSO. SHARED WITH THE AUTHOR MY CONCERNS. ABOUT WHAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE GOING THROUGH SINCE THE PANDEMIC- THE- AND YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD THEY BE FACING IN. IMPLEMENTING THIS BY- TWENTY TWENTY TWO. NOBODY EVER ANTICIPATED THE PANDEMIC- AND WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO. I KNOW AN L. A. U. S. T. EVERYTHING FROM PROVIDING MEALS FOR THE- STUDENTS AS WELL AS FOR THE ADULTS SAW MILLION MEALS GIVEN OUT. ALL OF THAT WAS TO RESPOND TO THE CRITICAL NEEDS THE EMERGENCY NEEDS HELLO LIFE AND DEATH NEEDS OF. OF OUR COMMUNITIES SO- I HOPE YOU CAN CONTINUE TO WORK LISTEN TO WHAT THE SCHOOL. DISTRICTS THE SCHOOL ENTITIES HAVE TO SAY- AND I HOPE THAT ALL OF THIS CAN BE DONE AND- IN CONSIDERATION OF THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH WHAT IS ALREADY- LAW. IN AND MAKE SURE. WE CAN. INCORPORATE THOSE CONCERNS BECAUSE THEY ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR DRESS- CENTER PORTANTINO WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND PLEASE YEAH I WOULD SAY THAT- THEN THAT THE CENTER I HAD A VERY NICE CONVERSATION TODAY ON THE FLOOR AND- CERTAINLY L. A. U. S. T. SHOULD BE. PLEASE WITH HER ADVOCACY ON THEIR BEHALF AND JUNO REPRESENTING OUR DISTRICT WELL. BUT I WOULD. RESPECTFULLY SAY TO THE L. A. U. S. T. IN EVERY DISTRICT AROUND THE STATE. DURING THE PANDEMIC CREATED CHALLENGES BUT IT ALSO PROVIDED THE OPPORTUNITY. TO PUT IN PLACE. THE LATE START FOR NEXT YEAR- WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT MENTAL HEALTH IS TO THE SAFETY OF OUR KIDS- THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO FOR OUR CHILDREN NEXT YEAR. IS TO START SCHOOL LATER BECAUSE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH WILL BE BETTER AND THAT'S JUST NOT OPINION THERE'S THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF PEER REVIEWED RESEARCH TO SHOW THAT THE FREQUENCY IN INCIDENCES OF SUICIDAL THOUGHTS DEPRESSION ANXIETY- ACTUAL SUICIDES GO DOWN WHEN CHILDREN GET TO SLEEP LATER IN THE MORNING. AND SO IF SCHOOL DISTRICTS WANT TO HAVE THAT POSITIVE AFFECT IMPLEMENTING LATE START SOONER ON THEIR OWN BEFORE THAT THE ACTUAL TIME FRAME IN THE ORIGINAL BILL GOES TO PUT WOULD GO TO THAT COURSE SO I'M HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH ANY SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND TALK ABOUT THEIR SPECIFIC ISSUES- BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY LET'S USE THIS PANDEMIC TIME WHEN KIDS ARE HOME. TO RETHINK HOW WE'RE GONNA GET HIM BACK TO SCHOOL ONCE WERE OPEN THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME TO DO THAT AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY. PARENTS TEACHERS. D. A. MEMBERS COMMUNITY MEMBERS HOW HOW MANY NEWS STORIES THERE ARE ON THE MENTAL HEALTH TOLL. THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS HAD ON OUR KIDS AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN DO TO HELP THEM. IS START SCHOOL LATER AND SO I HOPE THE L. A. U. S. T. REACHES OUT TO ME- AND I HOPE THEY DO IMPLEMENT AND START TO IMPLEMENT LIKE START SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. BUT IT'S A QUESTION THAT AND A CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN SO I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT. THIS ADDRESS ANY ADDITIONAL ITEMS. I THINK THE THEM- THE WAY THAT. WE AS A STATE AND I KNOW OUR GOVERNOR WORKED REALLY HARD ON THE ISSUE OF OUR SCHOOLS RE OPENING THAT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY EXTRAORDINARY FEAT TO JUST PLAN THAT OUT SO. I'M HOPING. WITH YOUR INVOLVEMENT- AND WITH THEIR CONCERNS AND THEIR EXPERIENCE SAID WE CAN DO THIS WE CAN DO THIS INA WAY THAT DOESN'T DISTRACT. ONE FROM THE OTHER THANK YOU. THE SENATE WRESTLED MISTER VICE CHAIR. PORTANTINO I'VE BEEN RESISTANT TO YOUR HAND BRACING OF THE LATER HIGH SCHOOL. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE EVER GOING TO GET ME THERE- I GREW UP. GETTING ON BUDGET SIX OR SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND I DIDN'T SEE ANY THAT HAVE COME INTO MY LIFE. BUT OF COURSE IN THE STUDIES THERE PROBABLY ARE PLENTY OF STUDIES. IT IS A SAD THING. TO CONTEMPLATE GETTING OUR KIDS BACK AND STRAIGHTEN BALLOT. FROM THIS PERIOD OF THE PANDEMIC. AND THE GREATEST DAMAGE DONE TO THEM HAS BEEN THE REMOTE SCHOOLING. AND THE RELUCTANCE OF SOME UNIONS. TO GET OUR TEACHERS AND OUR KIDS BACK IN THE CLASSROOM. THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR THEM AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD PAY SOME ATTENTION. TO THAT. IN ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO PUT ON THE TABLE LOOKS PRETTY CONTEMPORARY. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAS NOW DECIDED THAT GANGS ARE NOT A PROBLEM. AND HE'S MAKING. LOS ANGELES COUNTY OPEN THE GANGS HE'S INVITING THEM. INTO THE COUNTY. THAT IS A RECIPE FOR DISASTER. THE PEOPLE THAT COUNTY AND THE REST OF THE STATE WILL PAY A DEAR PRICE FOR GAS COMES NARAL VIEW. OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE. I KNOW HAS NO RELEVANCE TO YOUR BILL. YOUR AVAILABLE FOR YOUR BILL TODAY CONSERVE YOUR SINCERITY OF PURPOSE AND FOR SELLING. BUT I REALLY. WHICH LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR ALL RIGHT WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CONCERNS OR MOTION ON THE FLOOR. SOME OF THE WHERE WE GET A MOTION BY- CENTER DRIVE CIVIC SO MUCH AND SENATOR. MISTER SENATOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I WOULD THANK YOU- AND THANK YOU FOR POINTING OUT THAT THIS BILL IS NOT RELEVANT TO THE TO THE- GANG% ISSUE THAT YOU MENTIONED IN. THAT AND THANK YOU FOR RECOGNIZING THAT I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS ISSUE- AND YEARS AGO IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES ACTUALLY MOST HIGH SCHOOLS DID START LATER. AND THEN SOMEBODY HAD THIS BIG IDEA THAT. YOU KNOW WORLD GOT COMPLICATED LET'S MOVE EVERYTHING EARLIER. AND THAT JUST TURNED OUT TO BE CONTRARY TO SLEEP SCIENCE AND SO. IN ADDITION TO THE MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS OF STARTING LATER. BELIEVE IT OR NOT- CENTER. TEST SCORES GO UP. GRADUATION RATES GO UP AND ATTENDANCE GO UP. IN ADDITION ALL THE MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS SO ACTUAL AVERAGE DAILY. DOLLAR AMOUNTS WILL GO UP AND IF IN THE L. A. U. S. T. THAT GOES UP PERCENT. I THINK IT'S ONE PERSON IT'S LIKE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS OF EXTRA EIGHTY EIGHT. DOLLARS L. A. U. S. THE WOULD GO UP. BECAUSE ATTENDANCE WOULD INCREASE SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE I WAS VERY PLEASED TO WORK WITH THE CHAIR ON THIS CLEAN UP BILL AND- LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION AS AS WE MOVE INTO THE OTHER HOUSE. BEGIN CENTER PORTANTINO ALL THIS QUICKLY SAY YOU'VE BEEN PERSON OF YOUR WORD YOU WORK WITH US IN COLLABORATIVELY EVERY STEP OF THE WAY AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT YOU'VE- I JUST. TO THAT IN JUST WANT TO SEE HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH CENTER PORTANTINO VERY VERY GRATEFUL. FOR MR NO CAN YOU PLEASE CALL THE MOTION AND THEN CALL THE ROLL.

AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AS BEFORE- WITH- IF YOU THE SB SEVEN TWELVE IN S. B. SEVEN THREE FOUR. SO CENTER HUESO WHAT WE START WITH SB SEVEN TWELVE AND- JUST WANNA TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU- MISTER SENATOR FOR WORKING WITH US. AND ON THIS BILL THAT WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH CENTER HUESO AND GERMAN IS READY- ON THE BILL AND AS YOU KNOW SENATE HUESO. HAD OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH THE CHAIRMAN BUT WE DON'T HAVE. ANY AMENDMENTS IN FRONT OF US TODAY THERE IS A CONCEPT THAT WITHIN FIVE DAYS OF RECEIVING NOTICE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACID TRY FOR ECONOMIC BENEFIT INFORMATION IN OF TRIBES- DON'T RESPOND WITHIN FIVE DAYS- THEN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FREE TO BE ABLE TO PROCEED ON PARAPHRASING HERE. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH US ON THAT. AS LONG. ALONG WITH CHAIRMAN IS WELL. FOR SURE SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH I TO CONFIRM THAT WOULD. JUST SO IS- A HUNDRED ACT ONE OF THE YOU FOR- WORK WITH US THIS VERY. MESSAGE AGAIN THIS DOES BILL- TO RECTIFY YEARS OF LONGSTANDING DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES. BUT NOT MUCH NOT ONLY ARE STATE GOVERNMENT OR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- IT WITH REGARDS TO THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY. AND THIS IS A TEMP TO RIGHT KIND OF A WRONG IN HISTORY THAT- YOU KNOW CLUB. IT AMERICA A RESERVATIONS TO RELIEVE WAYS TO IMPRISON THE NEGATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND- HAVE THEM LOSE THEIR SELF SUFFICIENCY IN THE WERE OFTEN PUT. IN IN RESERVATIONS THAT HAD NO ABILITY TO PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD OR A BUSINESS OR OR PROVIDE EVEN HOUSING OR EDUCATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETIMES. LAND THAT WAS PUT ON ON EXTREMELY HOSTILE ENVIRONMENTS. OFTEN TIMES AND ON HILLSIDES AND MOUNTAINSIDES SOMETIMES WHEN THE LAND WAS A FLAT IT WAS- IN A CHECKERED PATTERN SO THAT THERE COULD BE NO CONTIGUOUS DEVELOPMENT. SO THIS THAT THIS BILL. IT IS A REALLY SMALL STEP TO RECTIFY BUT THAT. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT A CHARGE CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMMUNITY WHAT. OF REALLY SEEK TO MAKE SURE THEY THEY- INSTEAD OF JUST HAVING A LONG STANDING POLICY TO POSE ANY TYPE OF. ENDEAVOR BY A TRIBE TO PUT A LAND IN TRUST FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROVIDING THEMSELVES HOUSING TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR BUSINESS PLAN- THAT'S WHAT COUNTIES HAVE DONE THEY HAVE OPPOSED NO MATTER WHAT. AND OFTEN TIMES THESE. THESE EFFORTS TO PUT THIS LAND IN TRUST HAS REALLY POSITIVE ECONOMIC. BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITY FOR. NEVER MIND THE FACT THAT THESE ARE REALLY GOOD. FOR A FOR THE TRIBES THEMSELVES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEIR ABILITY TO SURVIVE AND TO PROSPER. SO THESE ARE GOOD THINGS THAT COUNTY SEVEN STARKLY OPPOSED SIMPLY ON A ON A QUESTION OF REVENUE TO THE COUNTIES IN. A NOREEN THE FACT THAT MORE REVENUE COULD COME IN FROM THE REV UP FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT THESE COMMUNITIES AND THESE COUNTIES. AS A RESULT OF THIS WE'RE LOOKING. FOR THE COUNTY TO BE. A FAIR. AND TO WORK WITH OUR NATIVE COMMUNITIES SENT TO RESPOND AS ANY CONCERNS THAT THEY MAY HAVE BEFORE THEY START TO OPPOSE. ANY EFFORTS FOR THE NATIVE AMERICANS BUT MANAGE TRUST SO- WE DON'T KNOW OF ANY OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL AND SO WE WORKED VERY HARD WITH YOU AND WITH OUR COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S RESPONSIVE TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS. TO GIVE A NATIVE AMERICANS ARE RIGHT TO FORM- RESERVATIONS OUR LANDS TO PUT THAT MUCH PUBLIC TRUST OUR CHIEF THEIR GOALS. THIS IS NOT. THIS WOULD THIS WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH. ALLOWING THEM TO PURSUE CONTINUE TO PURSUE GAMING THESE. LANDS THAT THEY WOULD- PUT TOGETHER ARE NOT AT ALL RELATED TO GAMING THIS IS SIMPLY. A LAND THAT WOULD HELP THEM PROVIDE HOUSING AND PROVIDE A SCHOOL LEAN AND- JUST BASIC SERVICES. TO THE PEOPLE OF THEIR- TRIBE SO WE ASK THAT YOU JOIN US IN THIS EFFORT. CORRECT SOME TORKEL WRONGS. AND SUPPORTER NAY INCOME MADE A- COMMUNITY WHICH I SOME OF THE- IMPOVERISHED- PEOPLE OF OUR STATE AND OUR COUNTRY THAT. SUFFER FROM THE LOWEST- EDUCATION ATTAINMENT RATES THE HIGHEST HIGH SCHOOL DROP OUT RATES. HIGHEST POVERTY RATES- NATIVE AMERICAN STUFF SEARCH STILL SUFFERING VERY MUCH IN NEED OF SUPPORT.

GERMAN WE'RE NOW MOVING ON TO THE SECOND AND FINAL BILL OF CENTER HUES THIS IS SB SEVEN THIRTY FOUR. ON REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES CENTER WAY SO THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THIS IS A SIMPLE BUILT NO OPPOSITION ALL IT DOES IS REALLY ALLOWS. COUNTIES TO ENTER INTO RENEGOTIATIONS WITH CITIES ON REDEVELOPMENT DEBTS SO THIS BILL SEEKS TO REALLY PROTECT THE FISCAL SOLVENCY OF. CALIFORNIA CITIES SAID ALLOWS THEM TO. TO RENEGOTIATE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF DEBT INCURRED TO THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES AND OF COURSE AS WE KNOW THE DISSOLUTION OF. REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES AFFECTED THEIR ABILITY TO REPAY SOME OF THAT THAT THE STATE HAS COME IN. AND MADE A COMMITMENT. TO REPAY IT BUT SOME OF THOSE- RESPONSIBILITY STATE BACK TO THE EARLY NINETIES AND THERE ARE. THEY ARE- AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTIES AND BECAUSE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES IT NORMALLY SOMEONE HAD FORTY YEARS TO REPAY THAT DIDN'T REALLY HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THOSE FORTY YEARS TO- REALLY ALLOW THEIR EQUIPMENT CREEK TO GROW TO KEEP THEIR OBLIGATIONS SO THIS REALLY THIS BILL REALLY DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FINANCIALLY DOESN'T OBLIGATE ANYBODY TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATIONS. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME COUNTIES AND CITIES ARE WILLING TO DO THAT BUT FEEL THAT THE LAW DOES NOT ALLOW THEM TO THIS WOULD SIMPLY ALLOW THEM TO SIT AT A TABLE TABLE AND REFINANCE DEBT THAT MAY BE ABLE TO COUNTY'S. THAT'S FOR YOUR EYES OPEN THAT WE DON'T KNOW OF ANY OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER HUESO NO EVEN WORK ON THIS YES WE DON'T HAVE ANY- OPPOSITION REGISTERED HERE AS OF AT THIS MOMENT BUT WE ARE GOING TO ASK BEFORE WE GO INTO OUR LEADERS SUPPORT WHEN HE SEES IT SERGEANTS COULD PLEASE CALL EITHER SENATOR RUBIO OR SENATOR BRADFORD WERE LOOKING FOR CENTER RUBIO.

WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK SENATOR RECENT FOR HIS SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND PRESENTING IT TO YOU. DENNIS IS A SENATOR INDICATED- YOU KNOW THE BUT A REDUCTION OR THE ELIMINATION. OF REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES. THAT ACTION HAD A DETRIMENTAL IMPACT UPON MANY CITIES. WHO HAVE THESE EXISTING PASSED THROUGH AGREEMENTS. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY ELIMINATED A KEY SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES. TO REPAY THE OBLIGATIONS INCURRED BY THOSE. THE IMPACTS ELIMINATE OF REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES HAS RESULTED IN MANY CITIES BEING% LEFT WITH EXORBITANT OBLIGATIONS. THE CITY OF HUNTINGTON PARK SUPPORT THIS BILL IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE COMMUNITIES JUST LIKE YOURS WHO UNDER SB SEVEN THIRTY FOUR WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO NEGOTIATE ADVOCATE ABOUT YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR MONEY. FROM THE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER INTEREST RATES ESTABLISHED OVER THE PAST AGREEMENTS AND WILL ALSO ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBLE REDUCTION OF PRINCIPAL OWED. BY THE FORMER REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES. SB SEVEN THIRTY FOUR PROVIDES OPPORTUNITY FOR RELIEF AND RECOVERY. FOR EXAMPLE CURRENTLY UNDER THEIR PASTOR AGREEMENT HUNTINGTON PARK WHOSE OPPRESSION PROXIMALLY TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS INTO THE HIGH INTEREST RATES THESE NUMBERS WILL CONTINUE TO SKYROCKET. SB SEVEN THIRTY FOUR PROVIDES THAT MECHANISM FOR LEVEL FEW BUTTERFIELD NEGOTIATIONS TO REDUCE THOSE AMOUNTS BY UP TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. AND TO ADJUST THE INTEREST RATE FROM THE RANGE OF PERCENT. SEVEN THIRTY FOUR IS IMPORTANT IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF CITIES TO PROTECT THOSE WHO PAY THEIR TAXES DURING THESE DIFFICULT TIMES. WE BELIEVE THAT SENATE BILL SEVEN THIRTY FOUR IS A BALANCED APPROACH IS A GOOD START AND A MUCH NEEDED COURSE OF ACTION TO ADDRESS A SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS OF FORMER REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES.

OPEN AGAIN THE JUMPSTART ACT HOPES TO FILL THE GAPS CREATED BY THE PROGRAMS LIKE PPP AND INVEST MORE THAN JUST A FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS INTO SMALL BUSINESSES THIS INVESTMENT WILL I BE IN THE FORM OF LOANS AS A STATE IT.

AND IT IS A LATINO CAUCUS PRIORITY BILL. THAT KELLY ITC IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS FOR REDUCING POVERTY ACROSS THE NATION. AND UNFORTUNATELY NOT EVERYONE RECEIVES A MEANINGFUL TAX CREDIT.

AND ALSO TAX CREDIT EXPANSION IN PARTICULAR ARE CRITICAL TO ADDRESS THE UNMET NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER ITIN. FILERS ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER MORE THAN HALF OF LOW INCOME WORKERS WHO BENEFIT. FROM THE COUNTY ITC ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT AND ABOUT HALF OF THOSE WORKERS GET LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS. MANY OF THE WORKERS WHO WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS ARE HARD WORKING INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS DURING CARPET NINETEEN AND EARNED VERY LITTLE. THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE. AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND CREDIT AT THE ONLY FOR TEN FOR EXCUSE. FROM THE FEATHER TAX CREDIT. IMAGINE THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT INCOME ELIGIBILITY THRESHOLDS IS CURRENTLY SET AT ONE DOLLAR ALLOWING FOR NEARLY ALL LOW INCOME WORKERS WITH CHILDREN TO BENEFIT HOWEVER THIS BILL WILL EXPAND THAT ELIGIBILITY BY LOWERING THAT THRESHOLD TO ZERO TO ENSURE THAT THE Y. C. T. C. IS INCLUSIVE.

OVERSEEING OUR VOLUNTEER INCOME TAX ASSISTANCE PROGRAM I'M HERE TO OFFER A PASSIONATE SUPPORT FOR SB SIX NINE ONE. THE EXPANSION OF THE CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND THE YOUNG TECH CHILD TAX CREDIT IS CRUCIAL TO THE BY THE CLIENTS WE SERVE. 40% OF WHOM IDENTIFIED PATINO AND MANY OF WHOM ARE I CAN ORDER AN UNPAID CAREGIVERS BUT THE COST OF LIVING RISING SO DRAMATICALLY OVER THE YEARS CONCERNED NUMEROUS LOCAL FIRE. I WOULD BE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH BEING AN ALL TIME LOW MORE AND MORE FAMILIES REMAIN AT RISK OF BEING HOMELESS AT ANY MOMENT. AN EXTRA ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS BACK TO A STRUGGLING FAMILY AT TAX TIME CAN KEEP THE LIGHTS ON CAN PUT FOOD IN THE REFRIGERATOR CAN FIX A CAR THAT VITAL TO GET TO WORK AND EARN A LIVING. THERE ARE ALREADY SO MANY BARRIERS ARE UNDOCUMENTED FAMILIES NEED TO NAVIGATE IN ORDER TO ACCESS ANY FINANCIAL RESOURCES AT ALL. THE RECEIVING MORE MONEY BACK AT TAX TIME CAN BE THE URGENTLY NEEDED WAIT A MINUTE THAT MAKES A DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE ON A DAILY BASIS ONE OF OUR TAX CLIENTS FIFTIES AND THE WORK THAT.

ALL RIGHT REYES IN GERMAN WE'RE NOW MOVING ON TO WE'RE JUMPING BACK TO ITEM NUMBER SIX SIXTY FOUR OF THREE THIS WAS ORIGINALLY GOING TO BE PRESENTED BY CENTER GONZALEZ SHE HAD ANOTHER MEETING SO WE ARE SO GRATEFUL THAT ARE AMAZING COMMITTEE MEMBER CENTER ARRIVES IT WAS GOING TO BE PRESENTING ON HER BEHALF HERE THAT SORT OF DRUGS- THE FLOOR IS YOURS ONSB FOUR OH THREE ALRIGHT THERE'S GREAT OKAY. WELL THIS WAS ORIGINALLY I'M READING THIS- STATEMENT ON BEHALF OF A SENATOR GONZALEZ AND SHE SAID GOOD MORNING. BUT IT'S GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON MR. MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS. AND WANTED TO THANK THE CHAIR AND HIS AMAZING STAFF FOR CRAFTING THESE AMENDMENTS. I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT SENATE BILL FOUR OH THREE. WHICH WILL PROVIDE STATE WATER AUTHORITIES WITH AN IMPORTANT TOOL. IN HELPING CALIFORNIA GET CLOSER TO FINALLY REALIZING THE HUMAN HUMAN RIGHT TO SAFE. RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB EIGHT EIGHT WHICH PROVIDED THE STATE WATER BOARD WITH THE AUTHORITY TO ORDER MANDATORY CONSOLIDATIONS. FOR WATER SYSTEMS. THAT SERVE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND THAT CONSISTENTLY FAIL TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER. WELL THIS OF FORTY IS IMPORTANT IN THE STATE'S SAFE DRINKING DRINKING WATER EFFORTS IT CAN ONLY BE USED IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE DAMAGE IS ALREADY DONE. AND THE SYSTEM IS ALREADY PROVIDING UNSAFE WATER WAITING UNTIL A STRUGGLING WATER SYSTEM FAILS BEFORE TAKING ACTION MAKES NO SENSE. THIS BILL PROVIDES A PROACTIVE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM BY EXPANDING THE S. B. EIGHT EIGHT CONSOLIDATION AUTHORITY. TO APPLY TO WATER SYSTEMS WITH. THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED CONNECTIONS OR LESS THAT SERVE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND ARE AT RISK OF FAILING CONSOLIDATION IS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL IN IMPROVING ACCESS TO SAFE WATER BECAUSE LARGER CONSOLIDATED SYSTEMS ARE GENERALLY MORE RELIABLE SAFE AND EFFICIENT. THAT IS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT 90% OF ALL DRINKING WATER VIOLATIONS IN CALIFORNIA OCCUR IN SMALL WATER SYSTEMS MEMBERS THE WATER BOARD'S RECENTLY RELEASED THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE RISK ASSESSMENT. AND THEY IDENTIFIED SIX HUNDRED SEVENTEEN AT RISK WATER SYSTEMS FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO POTENTIALLY AT RISK WATER SYSTEMS. AND DETERMINE THAT ONE THIRD OF THE ASSESSED DOMESTIC WELLS OR PROXIMATE LEAST SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND WELLS WERE CLASSIFIED AS HIGH RISK. THESE FINE BINDINGS DEMONSTRATE WHY WE MUST ACT NOW. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY I HAVE MICHAEL CLAIBORNE THE DIRECTING ATTORNEY FOR LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND ALSO ABLE CRUZ A RESIDENT OF TOTAL BILL THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS ON AS BEFORE THREE THAT CENTER DRAWS- PITCHING FOR CENTER GONZALEZ ON HER SB FOUR OH THREE. SO CURRENTLY ON THE LINE WE HAVE ONE OF OUR TWO LEADS WITNESSES MICHAEL CLAIBORNE IS WITH US HE SAID FROM THE LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. MISTER CLAIBORNE YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES AND I'LL GIVE YOU A THIRTY SECOND PROMPT- IN WILL WAIT TO SEE IF WE'RE GOING TO GET ABLE CREWS ON HERE IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS BUT MR CLAIBORNE WELCOME THE COMMITTEE THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THREE MINUTES PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON TO THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S MICHAEL QUICK ONE AND I'M A DIRECTING ATTORNEY WITH LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WHICH IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATION BASED IN THE FAMILY WALKING IN AND YOU COULD TELL ABOUT IT. THE V. DURING THE CORE THREE THANK THAN EVER THAN. FOR OFFERING A AND DORADO RECALL OFFERING AND PRESENTING THE BILL TODAY. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN DIFFICULT THAT SMALL WATER. IN HOUSE SERVED DOMESTIC BOX TO PRINT. BY AN ADDICT QUAN OF SAFE DRINKING WATER. THANK YOU FOR CAN THE CHALLENGES THAT SMALL WATER SYSTEMS STATE ANY CHALLENGES ONLY GETTING WORSE. WITH THE CLOUDS SMALLEST SYSTEMS AVAILABLE TO INCREASING GROUNDWATER POLLUTION EMERGING CONTAMINANTS. AND MORE FREQUENT AND SEVERE DROUGHTS THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD JUST COMPLETED OUR DRINKING WATER NEEDS ASSESSMENT. AND IDENTIFIED SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS AND EIGHTY THOUSAND DOMESTIC ROUTES THAT ARE AT RISK OF FAILURE IN THE STATE. APPROXIMATELY FORTY SEVEN NEW WATER SYSTEMS OUT OF COMPLIANCE EVERY YEAR. IN ORDER TO MAKE PROGRESS ON DRINKING WATER ACCESS WE MUST CORRECT THAT WE PROVIDE FOR PATRICK WATER SYSTEMS. AND WHAT MAKES SENSE OKAY POLITICIAN WATER SYSTEM AND THE MESS THE CROWDS WITH NEARBY LARGER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE WATER SYSTEMS. SB FOUR THREE BUILT ON SB EIGHTY EIGHT TO AID IN THE STRUGGLE TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS ACCESS TO SAFE AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. UNDER CURRENT LAW THAT THE BOARD IS NOT HAVE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO GET A HOLD A SINGLE ROOM TO TALK ABOUT CONSOLIDATION. SYSTEM IS NOT YET FAILED EVEN IF IT ENTIRELY PREDICTABLE BUT IT WILL FAIL. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO WAIT FOR WATER. ALCOTT AND FAMILY TO LOSE ACCESS FOR WATER AND THE STATE TO INEFFICIENTLY EXPEND% PUBLIC FUNDS TO DELIVER BOTTLED WATER. INSTEAD THE STATE'S WHO ARE PROACTIVELY ALONGSIDE COMMUNITY. PRIDE DENTED BY AND IMPLEMENT SOLUTIONS FOR SYSTEMS THAT ARE AT RISK AND ON THAT CUTS THE FAILURE. THE BILL IMPORTANTLY REQUIRED MEDICAL CONSULTATION AND CONSIDERATION OF INPUT FROM THOSE SERVED BY THE IRISH WATER SYSTEM THIRTY SECONDS AND I JUST WAS BY NOTING. THAT ACCESS TO TAKING ON WATER AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUE. WITH THE BURDEN THE CONTAMINATED TAP WATER SYSTEM FAILURE AND DROUGHT DISPROPORTIONATELY. IMPACTING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. CITY TALK WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES WE REPRESENT SENT PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEY ARE ALL ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. ON SB FOUR OH THREE. AQUA GREATLY APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THE COMMUNITY SENATOR GONZALEZ AND THE SPONSORS HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO IMPROVE THE BILL OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS. WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE MEETING SET THE DOCTOR STAFF IN THE SPONSORS INCLUDING MICHAEL CLAIBORNE I HAVE HAD WITH AQUA ON THIS BILL. THE FIRST PART OF THE BILL UP TO THE PROPOSED CONSOLIDATION MATURITY FOR THE AT RISK PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS WERE CLOSE TO RESOLUTION ON THAT PROPONENTS ALL. FOR EXAMPLE THE HEAT IN THE ANALYSIS THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FOR THE OCTOBER ADDING THAT THIRTY THREE HUNDRED CONNECTIONS CAP. AND SUGGESTED NONSENSE THAT'S A POSITIVE CHANGE HAVING THE CLEAR DEFINITIONS OF SUGGEST TO NONSENSE THAT'S ANOTHER POSITIVE CHANGE. THERE'S A SUGGESTION FOR DESIGNATION DISPUTE MECHANISM AND WE WANT TO REVIEW THAT LANGUAGE BUT WE AGREE WITH THE OSCAR IN THE SPONSORS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A GOOD PROCESS- YOU KNOW IN THAT CATEGORY. ARMY TO. AT THIS. IT THE OTHER PER OF THE BILL. AND THAT'S THE- FOR CAN. AUTHORITY OR THE AT RISK DOMESTIC WELLS. WE APPRECIATE THAT THE ANALYSIS SUGGESTED THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE INSPECTION OR TESTING OF THE DOMESTIC WELLS ON TO DETERMINE IF THEY'RE AT RISK. THIS RAISES THE QUESTION OF COURSE WHAT WITH THE INSPECTION OR MONITORING NEED TO SHOW FOR THE WORLD TO BE AT RISK AND I'M SO FOR THE BILL WOULD BE SILENT ON THAT. ARE YOU THINKING I'M JUST STEPPING BACK IS THAT THIS PART OF SB FOUR THREE THAT PROPOSES A CONSOLIDATION AUTHORITY FOR THE OUT REDUCE DOMESTIC WELLS WE THINK THAT'S PREMATURE. WATER BOARD DOES NOT GENERALLY REGULATE PRIVATE DOMESTIC WELLS THAT'S DONE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. THE WORKED AT THE STATE WATER BOARD ON AT RISK WELLS IS NEW THERE'S A LOT OF THAT GOING ON TO THE CREDIT OF THE STATE BOARD STAFF THIRTY SECOND WAS MUCH LESS DATA IT. MUCH LESS DATA IN THIS AREA THEN THERE IS FOR THE PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS IN THE STATE WATER BOARDS JUST STARTING TO IMPLEMENT STYLE. PRETTY NEW AT THE READY FOR CONSOLIDATION FOR THE FEELING WELL. CONSISTENT WITH OUR WATER WE SUGGEST NARROWING THE BILL COULD BE AT RISK PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS INTO LEADING THE PROPOSED AUTHORITY FOR THE AT RISK DOMESTIC WELLS THAT CAN-CONTRIBUTE IT'S MY TESTIMONY AND TAKE THE CHANCE TO PROVIDE THAT TODAY MR THANKS FOR YOUR PATIENCE IN HANGING WITH US THIS AFTERNOON WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU COMING IN- AT THIS LATE HOUR THANK YOU VERY MUCH MA'AM.

I CURRENTLY HAVE NO COMMENTS IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU MA'AM MODERATOR PRECIADO THE WORK LET'S TURN BACK TO COMMITTEE AND SEE IF WE HAVE QUESTIONS COMMENTS- CENTER WIENER. ARE WE GONNA MOTION SIR WIENER IS MOVING THE BILL RIGHT THERE AT PLEASE. MISTER VICE CHAIR. THURMAN AND COLLEAGUES AND MEMBERS WHO ARE. PAYING ATTENTION HERE TODAY. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED ISSUE. PATTERSON ISSUE THAT'S BEEN LONG NEGLECTED NO CHADLI SOME OF THESE. THOSE WHO TESTIFIED TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ABSENT. ABSENT NO WERE TO BE SEEN AND TALKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES. PARTICULARLY IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE ONE WE DEVISED A NEW WATER PLANNED FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'M DELIGHTED THAT THEY ARE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT HUMANS HAVE A WATER RIGHT. BUT IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE FOR DECADES. HUMAN WATER RIGHT USED TO BE THE PRE EMINENT RIGHT AND OVER DECADES THAT WAS DIMINISHED. TO A SMALL LOCAL THIRD OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR WATER HUMAN. PAGE WERE FIRST. NOBODY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THAT WE FINALLY DID ACCOMPLISH IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE SOMETHING TOWARDS THAT END. NOR WERE THEY HAVE VERY VERBOSE ABOUT ANY NEED TO INCREASE OUR WATER SUPPLIES IN CALIFORNIA. FINALLY IF PROPOSITION ONE WERE ABLE TO GET SOME FUNDS IN THERE TOO. AND CREATION SURPLUS STORAGE AT LEAST ONE LARGE SURPLUS STORAGE FACILITY. MOST OF THAT WILL BE PROBABLY ENVIRONMENTAL WATER. BUT IT DOES EASE THE PRESSURE. ENTRIES UP OTHER WATER SOURCES. IN ADDITIONTHEY WERE ABSENT WHEN WE WERE DEALING WITH THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT DISTRICT BEING CREATED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THEY ARE. UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BUT THE STATE HAS A PROVISION IN THERE WHERE IF THE STATE DOESN'T LIKE WHAT THE COUNTY DOES THEY CAN USURP. THAT LOCAL AUTHORITIES THIS WILL AFFECT. AT THE TIME IT WAS REPORTED THAT DOMESTIC WELLS WILL NOT BE BOTHERED. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU BETTER BELIEVE DOMESTIC WELLS ARE GONNA COME UNDER SOME KIND OF AUTHORITY. AND I DON'T NECESSARILY TRUST THE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TO BE REGULATING DOMESTIC WELLS. THE TRACK RECORD IN MANY AREAS IS NOT GOOD. IT'S A GOOD IDEA. BUT I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE FLOATED. A LOT FURTHER AND I THEREFORE CANNOT SUPPORT IT TODAY AGAIN WATER IS VERY VERY COMPLICATED. AND INDIVIDUALS WHO TRY TO ENGAGE IN THIS SHOULD REALLY COME TO UNDERSTAND A LOT MORE ABOUT IT I DON'T THINK SOME OF THOSE WHO ARE ENGAGED HERE. I DO UNDERSTAND THEY UNDERSTAND A NEED CLEARLY AND THERE IS A NEED WE'VE GOT PLACES SHOULD HAVE A REALLY SUFFERING LIKE PORTERFIELD. ALL THE OTHER HAND IT'S VERY COMPLICATED SO I SUGGEST WE MOVE SLOW. IT'S A GREAT YEAR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS. WE DO HAVE A MOTION- I'D ADVICE HERE WIENER.

HOUSING THAT DATA CENTER WIENER AND I WERE DEEPLY INVOLVED IN IN FACT CENTER WIENER WANTED FOR A COUPLE PAINS INTO IS I AT TOWARDS THE END OF IT- BUT I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR HIS WORK THIS TIME CENTER COM LONGER IS FOCUSING ON THE POTENTIAL OF A LOS ANGELES COUNTY REGIONAL HOUSING. FINANCE ACTING THE AUTHORITY THAT WOULD CREATE THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY AFFORDABLE HOUSING SOLUTIONS AGENCY- TODAY'S BILL- IT LOOKS DIFFERENT THAN IT REGIONALLY DIDN'T HERE'S WHY IT'S A STRIPPED DOWN VERSION OF THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION WHICH WILL ALLOW THE GOOD SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES WHO BY THE WAY IS AN ABSOLUTE CHAMPION FOR HOUSING AND- TO BE ABLE TO COMBAT THIS. HOW THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN LOS ANGELES IN CALIFORNIA IT'S GOING TO ALLOW HER MORE TIME TO BE ABLE TO FLESH OUT THE DETAILS OF THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE WHICH WILL DEFINE WHO SERVES ON THE BOARD. CENTER COME LONGER HAS BEEN WORKING WITH A BROAD COALITION OF SUPPORT- IN SHE PLEDGES TO BE FULLY TRANSPARENT AS SHE ENTERED- COALITION WORKS OUT THE DETAILS OF LEGISLATION IT EACH MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE. THE CHAIR OF HOUSING WHICH IS CENTER WIENER- IS WELL AS THE CHAIR OF THE PREPARATIONS CENTER PORTANTINO AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD I DON'T NEED TO TELL ALL OF YOU THIS AND IN PARTICULAR THE CENTER DRIVE SO THAT L. A. COUNTY STRUGGLED FOR DECADES TO BE TO CREATE AND PUSH. A COHERENT COUNTY WIDE APPROACH TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROTECTION. PRESERVATION PRODUCTION. SOME SAID WITHIN A COUNTY HAVE. DONE A LOT. OTHERS HAVE HAVEN'T DONE IT NEARLY AS MUCH. IN THE COUNTY HAS REALLY BEEN TRYING TO FILL THE GAPS AS A RESULT UNFORTUNATELY- L. A. COUNTY RANKS LAST IN THE NATION IN HOUSING AFFORDABILITY. OVERCROWDING IN UNSHELTERED- IN THIS IS RESULTED IN RAMPANT HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IT IS ALL OF YOU KNOW THIS WEEK A FEDERAL JUDGE ORDERED THE CITY AND COUNTY TO OFFER HOUSING TO THE ENTIRE. SKID ROW POPULATION BY OCTOBER. BUT SHE KNOWS THAT CLEARLY NOT ENOUGH IS IT IS HAPPENING DAVID PRESERVING CREATE HOMES FOR WORKING CLASS AND- LOWER INCOME FOLKS IN THE COUNTY. IN A SHE ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE HOUSING CRISIS IS FAR TOO GREAT TO BE DRESSED INDIVIDUALLY. BY THE COUNTY'S EIGHTY EIGHT INCORPORATED CITIES IT TRULY IS THIS REGIONAL CHALLENGE THAT. AS SENATOR COM LONGER IS 1100% COMMITTED TO TACKLING WHICH IS WHY THIS BILL IS IN FRONT OF US TODAY IN TRULY GRATEFUL FOR LEADERSHIP. IN AGAIN- LOOKING TO CENTER WIENER.

ON THE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PARTNERS IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT I WILL ALSO HONORED WITH THE L. A. SACRAMENTO DELEGATION HAD ELECTED THIS BILL AS ONE OF THE TOP PRIORITIES I'VE MET SOME OF THE LEADERS WITHIN THE DELEGATION INCLUDING SENATOR DROPPED THOUGH I HAVE STEPPED FORWARD TO COOPER THIS BILL. THIS IS THE SOLUTION OF BEING DRIVEN BY COMMUNITY HERE IN L. A. COUNTY BUT IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH ELECTED OFFICIALS- AND I'VE MENTIONED THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS UNDERWAY LOCALLY TO BUILD THE AGREEMENT NECESSARY ON THE CRITICAL PIECES OF THE BILL. THE MOST AFFECTED GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY TO ALLOCATE FUNDING ACROSS THE COUNTY AND WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF. BOB IS OPEN QUESTIONS ON THE APPROPRIATE TIME WENT. AWAY THAN WORKING FOR OVER A DECADE TO AND HOW MUCH DOES NOT HANDLE ACCOUNTING AND EVEN IF WE HAVE COLLECTIVELY DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE LEAVING ALMOST EVERY YEAR ALMOST HAVE NEVER LACKED INCREASE.

A. METRO AREA THAT WENT FOR LESS THAN A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH. AND THOSE WERE REPLACED BY UNITS THAT RENT. FOR AT LEAST 50% MORE. IF THERE WAS EVER A CREDIT. WITH CERTAINLY GET.
