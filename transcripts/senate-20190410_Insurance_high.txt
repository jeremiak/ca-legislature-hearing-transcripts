TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OUTLINED IN THE BILL'S ANALYSIS IN FACT WE HAVE ALREADY MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS ON THOSE ISSUES -- WITH -- DISCUSSIONS THAT HAVE STARTED AND WE'LL BE ONGOING AS THIS POLICY MOVES FORWARD. SB. FIVE THREE FOUR HAS THREE COMPONENTS FIRST WRIST OBVIOUS INSURANCE REQUIRED DIVERSITY SURVEYS STOPS IN. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHICH SUNSET ON JANUARY ONE OF THIS YEAR THE SURVEY REQUIRED EACH INSURANCE COMPANY IT DOES AT LEAST A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN CALIFORNIA PREMIUMS TO REPORT THE EFFORTS TO PROCURE GOODS AND SERVICES FROM DIVERSE. BUSINESSES SPECIFIC SPECIFICALLY. INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE REQUIRED TO REPORT ON THEIR PROCUREMENT FROM MINORITY. WOMEN OWNED AND DISABLED VETERANS ALL BUSINESSES THE TRANSPARENCY TREAT THROUGH THE SURVEY HAS HELPED HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSE CONTRACTING WITH IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. WE'VE ALSO SEEN THE GREAT SUCCESS WITH THE UTILITIES FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS WITH SUPPLIER DIVERSITY IN WERE STAN AND NOW WITH SB. ONE THAT ALSO HAS A SUPPLIER DIVERSITY COMPONENTS SO THIS IS NOTHING NEW AND IT MOVES IN THE DIRECTION OF CALIFORNIA'S SUPPORT IT. AS A RESULT OF CALIFORNIA INSURANCE RETIREMENT WITH DIVERSE ON BUSINESSES IT ROLLS FROM NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TO ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION. AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SB FIVE BEFORE INSURERS THAT THIS DATA CAMP I CAN'T CONTINUE TO BE COLLECTED. INCLUDES DIVERSE COMMUNITIES AND CATEGORIES THAT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED SUCH AS LGBT OWNED AND VETERAN OWNED BUSINESSES -- SECOND -- FIVE THREE FOUR CODIFIES THE GOVERNING BOARD DIVERSITY SERVER THE SURVEY DESIGNED TO IMPROVE DIVERSITY AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AN INSURANCE INDUSTRY. THE SURVEY IS ENTIRELY VOLUNTARILY BY AND VOLUNTARY. AND GIVES EACH BOARD MEMBER THE OPPORTUNITY TO SELF REPORTER DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN INSURERS ACROSS THE STATE REPORTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE THAT NEARLY 80% OF INSURANCE COMPANIES GOVERNING BOARD SEATS WERE HELD BY MEN. AND ONLY 12% OF THE SEATS WERE HELD BY PEOPLE OF COLOR. OF THE NEARLY TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED BOARD SEATS ONLY FOURTEEN MEMBERS SELF. IDENTIFIED AS LGBT. 13% REPORTED ZERO WOMEN AND 35% REPORTED ZERO PERSONS OF COLOR ON THE GOVERNING BOARD. THIS IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE DIVERSITY IS INTRINSICALLY BENEFICIAL TO THE INDUSTRY AND OUR STATE AS A WHOLE AS STATED. ITS BENEFIT ALL THE OTHER INDUSTRIES -- SEVEN S. ACCEPTED. SUPPLIER DIVERSITY RESEARCH SHOWS THAT BOARDS ARE BETTER EQUIPPED TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS AND CARRY OUT. THE FIDUCIARY DUTIES WHEN THEY HAVE A DIVERSE MIX OF BOARD MEMBERS FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND EXPERIENCES IT IS VITAL THAT WE CONTINUE TO COLLECT. THIS DATA IN ORDER TO FIND THE BEST APPROACH IS TO EVALUATE AN INCREASE DIVERSITY IN INSURANCE MARKETS. LASTLY FIVE THREE FOUR CODIFIES INSURANCE DIVERSITY TASK FORCE THE TASK FORCE IS COMPRISED OF FIFTEEN MEN MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER WHO ARE PRESENT INSURANCE COMPANIES. X. WRITTEN SUPPLIER DIVERSITY AND GOVERNING BOARDS DIVERSITY AND AND DIVERSE BUSINESS ENTERPRISES TASK FORCE ADVISES AND PROVIDES RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE APARTMENT OF INSURANCE ON HOW THEY CAN BEST MEET THEIR DIVERSITY GOALS. SB FIVE THREE FOR INSURERS A MEANINGFUL DATA CONTINUES TO BE COLLECTED AND BILLS UPON PREVIOUS EFFORTS TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS INCLUSIVE AND DIVERSE. HERE WITH ME TODAY AS MICHAEL MARTINEZ SENIOR DIRT SENIOR DOOR -- DEPUTY COMMISSIONER AND LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND LINDA. ROCKETS TO GO ALLAH. I'M I SAID I WAS GOING TO GET THE RIGHT IN A MESS THAT AT PRESENT NCO LEADERSHIP EDUCATION FOR THE ASIAN PACIFIC -- INCORPORATED I RESPECT LAST REVIVAL. MISTER MARTINEZ RED HOT MAYBE AFTERNOON TO REVIEW AND MEMBERS AND ADVISED HER JONES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HER MICHAEL MARTINEZ SENIOR DEPUTY COMMISSIONER. OF THE DEPARTMENT INSURANCE HERE FOR INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA. AND WE ARE PROBABLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AS A SPONSOR OF THIS MEASURE AND WANT TO THANK. SENATOR BRADFORD FOR HIS CONTINUED LEADERSHIP ON THE SIDE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE HERE FOR OUR STATE. I ABSOLUTELY JUST TO PROJECT THE THE AUTHOR'S COMMENTS AND JUST THREW OUT OF THEM BRIEFLY SO WE CAN ALLOW OUR OUT OF TOWN -- WITNESSES TO TO HAVE A BIT MORE TIME IS THAT THE COMMISSION DOES BELIEVE ENCOURAGING PROCUREMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE STATE'S SMALL BUSINESSES AND GOVERNING BOARD OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL PEOPLE THERE'S ACTUALLY TWO GREAT ECONOMIC. BENEFITS FOR THE ENTIRE STATE. AND THE BILL DOES ALLOW AND WILL ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE THIS RAPID GROWTH. OF THE INSURANCE SECTORS ROLE IN CONTRIBUTING TO VIBRANT LOCAL ECONOMIES. IDENTICAL TO WHAT. MISTER BRADFORD HAD STATED OF THE COMMITMENT AND MOVING FORWARD -- SHOULD AND AS HOPEFULLY THE BILL MOVES FORWARD TO THE DEPARTMENT AND THE COMMISSIONER WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THOSE -- REMAINING ISSUES WITH THE BILL AND WHAT THE AUTHOR AND WITH THE OFFERING WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF -- TWO REGISTERS THE LAST REMAINING ISSUES WITH THE BILL. AND AGAIN WORKING WITH INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES IS THE BILL CONTINUES MOVING FORWARD. AND SO THAT BEING SAID WE RESPECTFULLY ASK -- AND REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. I WAS THE FIRST WITNESS. LOW CHAIR RUBIO IN OF VICE CHAIR JONES -- MEMBERS OF THE SENATE INSURANCE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LINDA COULD YOU GO AND THE PRESIDENT AND CEO FELIPE LEADERSHIP EDUCATION FOR ASIAN PACIFICS. AND I'M ALSO THE CHAIR OF THE ALLIANCE FOR FOR DIVERSITY WHICH IS A COALITION OF FOR LEADERSHIP ORGANIZATIONS MADE UP OF CATALYST A WOMEN'S ORGANIZATION. HE'LL SEE OR THE EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL WHICH IS FOCUSED ON AFRICAN AMERICAN EXECUTIVES HISPANIC ASSOCIATION CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY. WHICH IS FOCUSED ON INCREASING CORPORATE ARE REPRESENTATION OF LATINOS AND HISPANICS ON OF IN COMPANIES AND LEAP WHICH IS MY ORGANIZATION WHICH IS FOCUSED ON A CAPPING LEADERSHIP FROM WITHIN THE ASIAN AND PACIFIC ON THE COMMUNITIES I AM ALSO A MEMBER OF THE OF THE INSURANCE DIVERSITY TASK FORCE. AT THE CALIFORNIA DIVERT -- DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AS WELL -- TO AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE ALL OF YOU TODAY -- I'M HERE ON BOTH BEHALF OF THE ALLIANCE FOR POOR DIVERSITY AND LEAD TO OFFER SUPPORT FOR SB FIVE THIRTY FOUR OF FOR VARIOUS REASONS ON SPECIFICALLY ONE OF OUR PIECES -- OR THE ONE OF OUR PIECES OF THE ALLIANCE FOR POOR DIVERSITY IS A MULTI YEAR STUDY THAT WE DO CONDUCT AT CALLED MISSING PIECES IT IS OUR LATEST REPORT WAS RELEASED JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO. WHICH LOOKS AT THE DIVERSITY OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES ON FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED CORPORATE BOARDS HAND IN THE OUT WE DO IDENTIFY. CERTAIN NUMBERS IN WHICH WE DO SEE THAT AMONG FORTUNE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES -- THERE IS STILL A LACK OF DIVERSITY ON THESE CORPORATE BOARDS OF FOR EXAMPLE MEN STILL OCCUPY 75% OF FORTUNE ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE POINT 5% OF FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES. IN TERMS OF LOOKING OUT OF PEOPLE OF COLOR WERE SEEN DAD -- ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS OCCUPY ONLY THREE POINT 8% OF FORTUNE ONE HUNDRED COMPANY BOARD SEATS -- FORTINOS OCCUPY ONLY FOUR POINT 4% AND AFRICAN AMERICANS OCCUPY ONLY JUST A LITTLE OVER 11% RESPECTIVELY ON FORTUNE ONE HUNDRED OUR BOARDS. THE NUMBERS ARE NOT THAT MUCH BETTER FOR FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED I DO ALSO WANT T SAVE -- JUST ONE NOTE IS THAT AS I LOOK OUT WHO ARE THE NEW BOARD MEMBERS COMING ON TO THESE FORTUNE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTUNE. FIVE HUNDRED COMPANY BOARDS NEW SEATS ARE NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO WOMEN AND MINORITIES IN LARGE NUMBERS WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT MORE THAN HALF OF NEW BOARD MEMBERS THAT CONTINUE TO BE ADDED. CONTINUE TO BE WHITE MEN OF WHAT WE ARE SEEING THOUGH IS THAT THERE IS SOME PROGRESS BUT WHAT I DO BELIEVE IS OUT WHAT GETS MEASURED GETS DONE. AND SO -- WHAT WE ARE EEING THROUGH OUR REPORT IS THAT? WE'RE SEEING COMPANIES LIKE PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL HAVE THE BROADEST DIVERSITY MEANING THAT THEY HAVE WOMEN. AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO AND ASIANS ON THEIR BOARDS -- WHAT WE'RE ALSO SEEING IS THAT RESEARCH DONE BY COMPANIES LIKE MACKENZIE IS SHOWING THAT THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE? OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND OTHER LARGE COMPANIES. DO REFLECT GREATER FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE WHEN YOU HAVE A MORE DIVERSE BOARD AND IN FACT WHEN A BOARD IS MADE UP OF ETHNIC DIVERSITY WERE SEEN ACTUALLY OF DIFFERENCE Ã¡WEEN DIVERSE AND THE LEAST DIVERSE COMPANIES IN TERMS OF THEIR PERFORMANCE AND SO. AS A NATIVE CALIFORNIAN -- I WOULD. EXPECT THAT ANYBODY WHO'S GONNA BE DOING BUSINESS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE LOOKING TO ACHIEVE THE BEST KIND OF PERFORMANCE FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO FOR THIS PURPOSE I DO WANT TO SAY THAT -- AS A MEMBER OF THE INSURANCE DIVERSITY TASK FORCE AS WELL. TOO I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE IS OF IMPORTANCE TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA I THINK IT'S ALSO OF IMPORTANCE -- TO TO THOSE WHO -- WORK AND ALSO BENEFIT FROM THESE COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS HERE AND SO I DO WANT TO SAY THAT -- AS AN ADVOCATE I DO WANT TO IN ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU TO PLEASE CONSIDER. ALL IN RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE IN FAVOR OF SB FIVE THIRTY FOUR THANK YOU LINDA. YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU TO THE I CHAIR VICE CHAIR MEMBERS FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY.

SB FIVE FORTY BY JONES. MISTER JONES DO I HAVE. LIKE SEVEN MISTER JONES YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN YOU REDDING ITEM THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES -- I THINK THIS IS A SIMPLE BILL ON AN INTERESTING TOPIC -- SO WE'LL SEE HOW IT WORKS OUT -- IT'S A NEW IT'S A NEW TOPIC TO ME. AND IT'S BEEN A FIND -- LEARNING EXPERIENCE A SPLIT DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY ALLOWS THE COST AND BENEFIT OF A PERMANENT LIFE INSURANCE POLICY TO BE SHARED. CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY ALLOWS NONPROFITS TO OFFER THESE UNIQUE POLICIES TO THEIR OFFICERS AS AN ADDITIONAL BENEFIT. THAT ENDS UP BEING COST NEUTRAL TO THE NONPROFIT. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THIS ARRANGEMENT TO HOLD BOTH THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE AND THE DEATH BENEFIT AS SECURITY. HOWEVER THIS REQUIREMENT TAKES AWAY THE BENEFIT TO THE OFFICER SINCE THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO UTILIZE ANY OF THE CASH VALUE OF THE POLICY SINCE IT IS. REQUIRED TO BE HELD AS SECURITY FOR THE ARRANGEMENT. SENATE BILL FIVE FORTY SLIGHTLY ADJUSTS THE VALUE THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE HELD A SECURITY. ON A SPLIT DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY UNDER A LOAN REGIME. TO EITHER THE DEATH BENEFIT OR THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OR BOTH. I'D LIKE TO ACCEPTED BOTH OF THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED ON PAGE FIVE OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. AND THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR DILIGENT WORK ON THIS BILL THESE AMENDMENTS WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THE CONTRACT BETWEEN THE NONPROFIT AND THE OFFICER. OR THE COLLATERAL ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT IS TRULY COST NEUTRAL FOR THE NONPROFIT. THIS BILL GIVES NON PROFITS IN CALIFORNIA RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION TOOL TO COMPETE IN THE EMPLOYEE IN THE EMPLOYMENT MARKET. I GET RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYBODY WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. SEE NO INTEREST ANYBODY WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. OKAY I WILL OPEN IT UP -- FOR MEMBERS TO ASK QUESTIONS. SENATOR ARCHULETA.

WHEN WHEN THE AGREEMENT HAPPENED BETWEEN THE TWO ENTITIES IS THERE A SET AMOUNT SIXTY FORTY FIFTY FIFTY ANYTHING IN THE FUTURE OR THAT SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN WORK ON MYSELF WE'RE NOT MANDATED ANYTHING BUT OUR STANDING AS THEY CAN? WHAT WELL IT'S BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE LIFE OF THE POLICY DOES THE POLICY MATURES AND? THE LIMIT THAT THEY CAN TAKE HIS ARE REGULATED SO THAT THE OFFICER CAN'T TAKE MORE THAN THE VALUE OF THE POLICY. THEY'RE ABLE TO WORK IT OUT THEMSELVES CORRECT VERY GOOD THANK YOU.
