THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS ASSN HERTZBERG REGRETS THEY CANNOT PRESENT THIS MORNING BUT HE APPRECIATES THAT YOU WORK WITH US ON THE MEASURE HERE -- IN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF DON'T USE CANNABIS LEGISLATION CONSUMERS BOUGHT AN ESTIMATED THREE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE MILLION WORTH OF MARIJUANA PRODUCTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE STATE COLLECTED OVER SIXTY MILLION. IN TAX REVENUES WHILE THESE FIGURES WERE LOWER THAN EXPECTED IS STILL AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF CASH TO MANAGE. AND THIS CASH INFUSED INDUSTRY HAS PRESENTED A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE THEY HAVE ALSO THEIR BEEN SEVERAL INCIDENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHERE INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN ROBBED A OF CASH OF CASH IN PRODUCTS. AS POLICY MAKERS THERE'S A DUTY TO FURTHER THE WILL OF THE VOTERS WHILE PROTECTING THE PUBLIC SAFETY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS AND BY CREATING A PATH FOR THESE LIMITED CHARTER BANKS WE ARE FULFILLING THIS DUTY. WITH US HERE TODAY AS PART OF EQUALIZATION MEMBER FIONA MA THE SPONSOR OF A BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEMBERS -- UNDER PROP TWO FIFTEEN PASSED TWENTY YEARS AGO OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION WAS AUTHORIZED TO COLLECT SALES TAXES FROM THE DISPENSARIES. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE CONFLICT OF THE BOARD NEVER REALLY COLLECTED IT UNTIL ABOUT -- NINETEEN NINETY SIX IT HAS BEEN A REAL STRUGGLE FOR THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. UP BUT WHEN -- I GOT ELECTED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN I ASKED THE BOARD TO TELL US HOW MUCH. A WE'VE BEEN COLLECTING FROM THE DISPENSARIES SO BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WE COLLECTED ABOUT FORTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. OF FROM THE DISPENSARIES I BELIEVE THAT IS VERY LOW AYE AND AS OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE COLLECTED NINETY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION. I STILL THINK THAT THAT'S VERY LOW BECAUSE OF THE UP MICHAEL BANKING ACCESS -- AS ALL OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW. THERE IS A LOT OF CRIME ASSOCIATED WITH -- COMPANIES INDIVIDUALS KEEPING LARGE AMOUNTS OF CASH AT THEIR HOME. HOW BUSINESSES ARE IN THEIR BACKYARDS AND FOR IBM WE PURPOSES WE CANNOT AUDIT CASH? A AND SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO OUR WORK. A WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR WORK AROUND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NOT -- CREATED ANY -- BANKING ACCESS OR HAS -- OR HAS SHOWN THAT THEY'RE GONNA -- EASE BANKING ACCESS OF THE JUST BE TOWED OR KILLED ANOTHER BILL IN CONGRESS LAST WEEK. AND SO THIS BILL IS VERY IMPORTANT SB NINE THIRTY WOULD. GIVE A STATE CHARTERED. UP LICENSE OUGHT TO STATE CHARTERED -- BANKS A SPECIAL CANNABIS LICENSE WHERE THEY CAN -- EXCEPT CANNABIS ACCOUNTS FOR A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PURPOSES. ONE TO PAY THEIR OUR STATE TAXES ON NUMBER TWO TO PAY THEIR RENT SWITCHES ARE USUALLY QUITE A LOT. OF THREE TO PAY -- VENDORS -- THAT THEY DO BUSINESS WITH AND THEN FOR TWO BY CALIFORNIA STATE BONDS THIS WOULD BE A CLOSED LOOP SYSTEM A IT WOULD BE WHAT WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE AND HOME WE BELIEVE YOU KNOW WE'D BE THE FIRST STATEMENT NATION -- TO PASS THIS TYPE OF LAW. AND WE BELIEVE IF THIS DOES PASS OUT THIRTY AT LEAST THIRTY STATES WILL BE CHINA PASSED SIMILAR LEGISLATION I MEAN OUR HOPE OBVIOUSLY IS TO HAVE CONGRESS I'LL OPEN UP. UP BANKING FOR THIS INDUSTRY IT'S ANYWHERE BETWEEN EIGHT TO TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT WITHOUT A BANKING AXIS IT IS VERY VERY HARD TO DO BUSINESS IN VERY HARD FOR US TO TRACK AT THE TAX BOARD.

RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE TO PAY ME WITH THE BRIEFCASE FULL OF CASH AND IF THIS BILL SHOULD PASS THEM. THEY PAYMENT WITH A CHECK DRAWN ON A CATTLE CANNABIS CHARTER BANK AND I DO WHAT WITH THAT CHECK [inaudible] WELL. OKAY SERVICES SO THE THE VISION IS THAT OUT WE WILL HAVE A NETWORK OF BANKS ACROSS THE STATE THAT WOULD BE ABLE -- TO EXCEPT YOU CHECKED YOU WOULD HAVE YOUR ACCOUNT -- DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE SO. YOU COULD TRANSACTIONS LIKE EVERYONE THAT IT HAD TO BE ONE OF THE BANKS IN THE NETWORK. OKAY SO. SEE YOU WOULDN'T BECAUSE IT YOU ARE AS A LANDLORD I HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT WITH A NON CAN'T OF THIS CHARTER BANK. AND I'VE GIVEN THE I'VE BEEN GIVEN THIS CHECK DRAWN ON A CANNABIS CHARTER BANK WOULD I DO WITH THAT CHECK WILL YOU WOULD OPEN UP AN ACCOUNT AT ONE OF THE CANNABIS CHARTERED BANKS. AND YOU WOULD HAVE TWO ACCOUNTS. AT SO I DEPOSIT THE CHECK IN IN MY ACCOUNT OF THE CANWEST HER BACK AND YOU KNOW I GET MY MONEY OUT OF THIS THING TAKEN UP BY CASH IF YOU NEED IT. OTHERWISE LEAVE IT IN THERE YOU CAN USE IT TO YOU KNOW PAY YOUR STATE TAXES -- YOUR FRANCHISE TAX BOARD EURO YOUR SALES TAX IF YOU HAD ANY SALES TAX YOU CAN BUY CALIFORNIA BONDS WITH IT.

YOUR HOUSE ARE AND MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY CAN TAKE THE CASH. OKAY SO OUT OF CURIOSITY WHY INCLUDES THE PURCHASE OF CALIFORNIA STATE BONDS IN THE ALLOWED USES -- YES SO THAT WAS -- SENATOR HERTZBERG'S IDEA IS THAT -- WE WANT PEOPLE TO DO SOMETHING WITH THE MONEY SO YOU'RE NOT SITTING EVERY MONTH TO GET FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN RENT YOU'RE LIKE WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH IT I'M NOT EARNING ANY ANY INTEREST -- IT'S JUST SITTING THERE WHY DON'T I DO SOMETHING WITH IT AND WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO INVEST IN CALIFORNIA STATE BONDS.

STEPS A QUORUM THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER WILL NOW MOVE ON TO FILE ITEM NUMBER TWO WHICH IS S. B.. THREE ELEVEN BY SENATOR PAN THIS ALSO DOES ENJOY IN AYE AYE RECOMMENDATIONS CENTERED PAN WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PATIENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR LOW I'M AND CAN BE MEMBERS. MIGHT SET THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS LAID OUT THE NOW SO S. B. THREE ELEVEN WAS RECENTLY AMENDED TO CLARIFY EXISTING LAW TO ALLOW FOR PROOF CANNABIS PRODUCTS GO FROM ONE TO STE DISTRIBUTOR TO ANOTHER. DUE TO A STRICT INTERPRETATION CURRENT LAW THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL WILL NO LONGER ALLOW FOR PROVED CANNABIS PRODUCTS TO GO FROM ONE DISTRIBUTOR TO ANOTHER DISTRIBUTOR. AND THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE ACT WAS TO ENSURE THAT PRODUCTS ARE TESTED BEFORE ENTERING THE COMMERCIAL MARKET NOT PREVENT TRANSFERRING OF TESTED PRODUCTS BETWEEN LICENSE DISTRIBUTORS. WE'RE ADDING URGENCY BECAUSE OF THE ISSUE CAN BE ADDRESSED THIS YEAR TO PREVENT UNNECESSARY ENFORCEMENT BURDEN AND BACKLOG ON THE BCC. TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL SIMPLY CLARIFIES AND APPROVED CANNABIS PRODUCT TO MOVE FROM ONE DISTRIBUTION ANOTHER AND DOES NOT ADDRESS TESTING STANDARDS BEING PLACED ON CABS PRODUCTS. ESPECIALLY ASK WHEN I VOTE AND I HAVE TWO WITNESSES AND SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND UP TO TWO MINUTES IN TOTALITY. IS PLEASED THAT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS LAUREN FRAZIER AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CANNABIS DISTRIBUTION ASSOCIATION SPONSORED S. B.. THREE ELEVEN CURRENT LAW READS IT AFTER TESTING ALL CANNABIS AND CANNABIS PRODUCTS FIT FOR AYE SALE MUST BE TRANSPORTED ONLY FROM THE DISTRIBUTORS PROMISES TO THE PROMISE ABOUT LICENSE RETAILER MICRO BUSINESS. SP THREE ELEVEN WOULD CLARIFY THAT HAS A PRODUCT MAY ALSO TRANSFER TO ANOTHER LICENSE DISTRIBUTOR. THIS CLARIFICATION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF THE LAW WHICH IS TO ENSURE THAT PRODUCTS MEET TESTING REQUIREMENTS BEFORE ENTERING THE RETAIL MARKET. CONSIDER HUMBOLDT COUNTY DISTRIBUTOR WHO AGGREGATES PRODUCT PACKAGES IT AND TEST IT. AND THEN TRANSFER THAT REACH ALREADY PRODUCT TO ANOTHER DISTRIBUTOR IN SAN FRANCISCO OR LOS ANGELES. IT'S NOT REASONABLE TO EXPECT THE EVERY DISTRIBUTOR HAVE ITS OWN DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES IN EVERY MAJOR RETAIL MARKET. BY ENFORCING THIS POLICY WE WOULD BE PAVING THE PATH FOR ONLY THE MOST WELL CAPITALIZE DISTRIBUTORS TO OWN THE MARKET. AND ARE VASTLY DISTRIBUTOR TO DISTRIBUTOR PARTNERSHIPS ARE AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY. LEVERAGING A STATEWIDE NETWORK OF DISTRIBUTORS ENSURE SMALL BUSINESSES CAN COMPETE WITH LARGER PLAYERS WHO CAN AFFORD AN INFRASTRUCTURE OF MULTIPLE DISTRIBUTION HOUSE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. CALIFORNIA IS THE LARGEST AND MOST DIVERSE CAMPUS MARKET IN THE WORLD OUR DISTRIBUTION LANDSCAPE REQUIRE SPECIALIZATION IN CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN FUNCTIONS FROM STORAGE SERVICES TO LAST NOW TRANSPORT TO AGGREGATION AND QUALITY VERIFICATION. TODAY THE MAJORITY OF LICENSE DISTRIBUTORS RELY AND DEPEND ON PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER DISTRIBUTORS. WITHOUT THEM THERE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT BOTTLENECKS IN THE SUPPLY REACHING THE RETAIL MARKET AND SIGNIFICANT HARDSHIP FOR LICENSE PRODUCERS DUE TO THE IMPACT OF DUPLICATE TESTING COSTS. AND REDUNDANT QUARANTINE TIME ON THE SAME PRODUCTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN APPROVED FOR RETAIL SALE. AS DISTRIBUTORS OUR JOB IS TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF THE PRODUCT AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE SUPPLY CHAIN. THE ACT REQUIRES EVERY PRODUCT SOLD IN CALIFORNIA TO BE IN A TAMPER EVIDENT PACKAGE WITH A UNIQUE IDENTIFIER. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF S. B. THREE ELEVEN WOULD REQUIRE DISTRIBUTORS TO DOCUMENT THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY AND TO VERIFY THE UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN CORRESPONDING CERTIFICATE OF ANALYSIS FROM. THE LICENSE TESTING OP. IF EVERY TYPE ELEVEN DISTRIBUTORS HELD TO THE SAME STANDARDS OF COMPLIANCE THAT EACH HAS ASSUMED THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENSURING PRODUCTS ARE FIT FOR SALE BEFORE ENTERING THE RETAIL MARKET. OR OTHERWISE RISK LOSS OF LICENSURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU VERY MUCH OF THE TENTATIVE LIST BUT PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION JUST WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS AB PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED BY THE AUTHOR. AND I THE OTHER SPONSOR SCCA IS ALSO PLEASED TO CO SPONSOR I THINK I'LL JUST CLOSE BY SAYING THE ABSENCE OF SUCH OPTIONS AS THIS BILL PROVIDES ONLY DISCOURAGES COMPLIANCE WITH IN THE STATE'S COMPLEX.

PODIUM. AND UP TO TWO MINUTES PLEASE PRESENT WHENEVER. ALRIGHT MISS CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MARKET PREY ON BEHALF OF GOLDEN SYSTEMS WHICH OPERATES SAYS. SEE FOUR DISTRO -- WE ARE A DISTRIBUTOR AND IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR DISTRO WAS CO FOUNDED BY -- ERIC SPITZ THE FORMER I LOVE THE FORMER OWNERS OF THE ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER OF MY FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL BILL LOCKYER. I BELIEVE YOU HAVE OUR LETTER -- YESTERDAY I APOLOGIZE FOR THE LATENESS. OF OUR OPPOSITION THEN OF COMMUNICATED THAT TO THE AUTHOR. OF THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE WITH THE SP THREE THREE ONE ONE IS THAT. OF THIS MEASURE NOW MEN'S EXISTING LAW TO ALLOW DISTRIBUTORS TO TRANSPORT. CANNABIS OR CANNABIS PRODUCTS TO THEIR PROMISES OF ANOTHER. BUT A CALIFORNIA'S POLICY WAS SET UP TO SPECIFICALLY ENSURING THAT TESTING OCCURS AT THE FINAL POINT IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. PRIOR TO HEADING UP TO THE RETAILER ITSELF I'LL POINT OUT THAT -- THE EXISTING LAW -- CURRENTLY PROVIDES FOR A TYPE ELEVEN TRANSPORT ONLY DISTRIBUTOR AND SO A IN OUR VIEW THE CASE HAS NOT BEEN MADE. SUPPORT ONLY DISTRIBUTION LICENSE IS INSUFFICIENT FOR PURPOSES OF AMENDING THE LAW OUR CONCERN IS IS THAT WITH WITHOUT THE STATE LAW CURRENTLY BEING FULLY IMPLEMENTED I POINT TO POINT OUT THAT TRACK AND TRACE. HAS NOT YET COMMENCED THE JULY ONE LABORATORY TESTING DEADLINE IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER AND THAT THIS IN IN FACT CREATES A OPPORTUNITIES FOR MISCHIEF IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. BOTH FROM A FROM A TESTING PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO FROM THE COLLECTION OF TAXES WITHOUT THIS LAST MILE. A TEST CALIFORNIA'S CANNABIS CONSUMERS MAY BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT IRREGULARITIES AND CONFUSION THAT CURRENTLY INHIBIT -- INHABITS THE CALIFORNIA'S NAISSANCE A ACCOUNT OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN. STATE IN CALIFORNIA FROM OUR STANDPOINT CANNOT TOLERATE THIS RISK AND WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. SEE NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES OPPOSITION ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. SEE NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME SENATOR PANDEY WAS TO CLOSE. THE THANK YOU I I WOULD JUST MAKE NOTE THAT -- UNDER JUST BILL -- PRODUCTS WILL BE TESTED AND THEN THEY WILL HAVE TO BE PACED IN A TAMPER PROOF PACKAGE AS ESTABLISHED BY LAW. SO AT THAT POINT IN TIME -- BASICALLY THE PRODUCT IS IT YOUNG HAS BEEN TESTED IT'S BEING PLACED IN A IN AN AND A PRODUCT THAT WILL ENSURE THAT WILL BE NOTED THAT IF THERE IS ANY EFFORT AT AT TRYING TO A TAMPER IF THERE IS -- EFFORTS TO DO THAT I THINK THAT. WE'RE NOT OTHERWISE HE'D HAVE TO SAY WOULD HAVE TO TELL THE RETEST EVERY SINGLE SAMPLE IF YOU REALLY ARE TRYING TO CATCH. OFTEN BETWEEN SO I THINK THAT THIS BILL CERTAINLY ASSURES THAT WE HAVE THOSE PROTECTIONS THOSE A PATIENT PROTECTIONS THAT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN PLACE -- AND THIS WILL SIMPLY HELP FACILITATE -- ACTUALLY TRANSPORT OF TESTED -- PRODUCT THAT'S ALREADY IN A TENT IT INAPPROPRIATE PACKAGING EXPECT WE ASK WHAT AYE VOTES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR PENN THIS DOES AND JOIN AYE RECOMMENDATION AND WE WILL -- HERE TAKE UP THE BILL WHEN WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A QUORUM. OF THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR PAN NOW GO AGAIN IN FIVE ORDER WHICH IS FILE ITEM NUMBER SIX S. B.. NINE THIRTY SEVEN WITH SENATOR WIENER. SENATOR WIENER WELCOME. S. B. NINE THIRTY SEVEN ARE INSURERS THAT -- MOTHERS WHO RETURNED TO WORK AFTER GIVING BIRTH -- ARE ABLE -- TO AND WHO ARE LACTATING OR ABLE TO EXPRESS OUR MILK AT WORK LOTS OF THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO MAKE A TERRIBLE CHOICE OF EITHER RETURNING TO WORK AND US STOPPING THEIR BREAST FEEDING. WERE WANTING TO CONTINUE BREASTFEEDING AND BEING UNABLE. TO RETURN TO WORK THE BILL'S. REALLY FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT ALLOWING A NEW MOTHERS TO THE SIDE TO THEMSELVES -- WHEN THEY RETURN TO WORK -- I'M NOT MAKING THAT DECISION FOR THEM WE WANT -- MOTHERS TO BE ABLE TO BREAST THEIR CHILDREN AND WE WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO WORK AND THE TWO ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. OUR CURRENT LAW AYE IS VERY -- BAREBONES IT REQUIRES THAT AN EMPLOYER ALLOW. A WOMAN TO TAKE A BREAK TO EXPRESS MY FORCEDTO DO IT SITTING ON A TOILET. AND THAT'S GREAT NOT TO FORCE PEOPLE TO EXPRESS MARK WAS SITTING ON A TOILET BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH. SO THE BILL WILL PUT BASIC STANDARDS IN PLACE REQUIRING ON A PRIVATE AREA CAN BE -- A ROOM -- IF I THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR EXAMPLE IN A SMALLER -- COMMERCIAL SPACE I A CAN BE AYE MORE TEMPORARY -- SET UP -- THERE'S FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF MULTI UNIT -- COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS ARE DIFFERENT STORES OR OFFICES SHARING. OF ONE LACTATION SPACE -- THEIR SPACE ALSO OUT OF A TABLE A CHAIR. ON ACCESS TO POWER AND THERE NEEDS TO BE REFRIGERATION AND THOSE HAVE TO BE IN THE SPACE BUT AT LEAST -- NEARBY. SO IS BASIC IS FLEXIBLE -- THERE IS A HARDSHIP -- THAT CAN BE SOUGHT -- BY A AYE BUSINESS UP TO FIFTY EMPLOYEES LOBBY WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND TAKEN QUITE A FEW AMENDMENTS. WHAT'S REALLY ADDRESSES MANY OF THEIR CONCERNS AS WERE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES THAT. FOR A LARGER NEW -- A COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION AT LEAST FIFTEEN THOUSAND SQUARE FEET -- THAT THERE BE -- LACTATION SPACE INCORPORATED IN THE CONSTRUCTION THAT WOULD BE SET. RORY I JUST SAID I SHOULD SAY WE ASK -- THE NEXT SO THE CODE IS UPDATED. THAT THAT TYPE OF PROVISION BE INCLUDED. LOTS OF THIS IS -- HARDCORE AND STEP.

GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S LAURA CURTIS I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND JUST A COUPLE THINGS TO START OFF AND THIS IS NOT A DESIGNATED JOB KILLER CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ACTUALLY SUPPORTS THE POLICY BEHIND THE BILL. A WE WANNA WELCOME OUR AYE FEMALE EMPLOYEES BACK TO WORK AS WELL AS THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY DOES. THE SAME AND WANTS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE COMFORTABLE IN THEIR BREAST FEEDING ABILITIES HOWEVER THAT WE DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL. THE BILL WAYS AND TO BE STRUCTURED AFTER THE SAN FRANCISCO ORDINANCE HOWEVER THERE ARE TWO LARGE PROVISIONS A IN THE BILL PART OF IT'S A BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE AT THE ARCHIVAL DISCUSSED. BUT THE OTHER ISSUE IS THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION CURRENTLY THE SAN FRANCISCO ORDINANCE DOES NOT HAVE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION NEED FORSMAN MEASURES THROUGH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THIS WOULD ALLOW AN EMPLOYEE TO BRING A EVEN IF THEY'RE PROVIDE THE ACTUAL ELECTED ACCOMMODATION THEY COULD STILL BRING THE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR THE SMALLER NUANCES OF THE BILL SUCH AS NOTICE REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. AND SO THAT'S A HUGE CHANGE IN THE LAW FOR US -- ADDITIONALLY THIS IS MUCH MORE EXPANSIVE AT THE CURRENT LACTATION ACCOMMODATION IS SIMPLY A PLACE OTHER THAN A BATHROOM STALL SU GOING FROM A ONE TO TWO SENTENCE REGULATION. TO A MULTI PAGE REGULATION AND EMPLOYERS AND JUST TRYING TO COME TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY I'M A COMPLY WITH THIS ORDINANCE WITHOUT THE THREAT OF CONTINUED LITIGATION OVERSIGHT ON MY NEW ISSUES. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED TODAY WE WE ARE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE SENATOR AND WE APPRECIATE HIS OFFICE ABILITY TO WORK WITH US BUT WE DO FEEL WERE AT A POSITION RIGHT NOW WITH THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AND THE BUILDING CODE ORDINANCES AS WELL. SOME OTHER ISSUES WITH THE BILL THAT WE'RE NOT SURE AND HOW MOVEMENT ALBUM AND THAT'S WHEN THE FORT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MATTHEW HARD OF THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION WE HAVE TRIED TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORS OF THE BILL HAS BEEN AMENDED TO GET TO THE SAN FRANCISCO ORDINANCE. WHICH WAS JUST PASSED LAST YEAR AND HAS JUST STARTED TO BE IMPLEMENTED. THE ISSUE FOR OUR MEMBERS IS THAT IT DIRECTS. PHYSICAL BUILDING OF ROOM SPECIFIED FOR A CERTAIN ACTIVITY THERE'S NOTHING ELSE REALLY IN THE BUILDING CODE THAT IS SIMILAR TO THIS. SO FOR A LOT OF YOUR BILL DOUBTS ON EXISTING BUILDINGS WHICH ARE MEMBERS ARE CURRENTLY DOING WE'VE ACTUALLY PROVIDED INFORMATION. ON SOME OF THESE BILL DOUBTS YOU'RE LOOKING AT ANYWHERE FROM A THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR TWO HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS EXPENSE COURSE THE UPPER END OF THAT IS A VERY VERY NICE APPORTIONED ROOM. BUT THIS BILL IS STILL TAKING A AND APPROACH TO THIS WHERE YOU'RE REQUIRING. PACIFIC BELL ROOMS AND TENANT IMPROVEMENTS ULTIMATELY MY MEMBERS ARE GOING TO DO THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE FINE WITH THAT BUT THAT COSTS. WILL ALL GET PASSED ALONG TO THE SMALL BUSINESSES. WE'RE HOPING THAT WE HAVE AN APPROACH THAT IS MUCH SO MORE SIMILAR TO CURRENT LAW AND WE'RE WORKING ON IN THIS BUILDING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN WHERE EMPLOYERS CAN FIGURE OUT. HOW TO PROVIDE THIS ACCOMMODATION WITHOUT ACTUALLY HAVING TO PHYSICALLY CONSTRUCT A ROOM? SO FOR THOSE REASONS. WE URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PAYMENT AFFILIATION IF YOU WISH TO DO SO. I MISTER CHAIR CHRIS MCCAIN THE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION ALSO ON THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS WHY WERE OPPOSE THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DAY BUTLER ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED CHAMBER ADVOCACY NETWORK A COALITION OF LOCAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ORGANIZATIONS. HEARING THE SACRAMENTO MARKETPLACE ALSO OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING KATIE HANSEN WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WE ARE ALSO OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED ON THIS BILL. KITTEN COLEMAN CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION I WERE OPPOSED TO THE REASONS STATED THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AND ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM CAN YOU MEMBERS AT THIS TIME ASSEMBLY WOMAN BAKER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. I'M SO SORRY THAT YOUR WITNESS LOST A SPORTS CAR. TRY TRY BREASTFEEDING. OR DOING THIS I WOULD SUGGEST IT BUT AND I'M YOUR GUIDE BRACE THE MANY VIA NOTES A WONDERFUL VEHICLE -- IT'S IT'S FANTASTIC -- I IN SERIOUSNESS KNOW RICK I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS TO MAKE -- THIS. I EASIER FOR WOMEN RETURNING TO THE WORKPLACE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN BE DOING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR WOMEN TO RETURN TO THE WORKPLACE -- AND I I'VE BEEN PLEASED TO SUPPORT EFFORTS -- JUST THIS YEAR TO TRYING TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR EMPLOYERS HAVE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS -- I ISSUE. THOUGH THE OPPOSITION IS EXPRESSED AS PAGA. AND PAM IF WE ARE TOO RESTRICTIVE WITH VAGUE TERMS WE DO OPEN OUR EMPLOYERS OUT WHO ARE TRYING TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES -- TO NOT ONLY LAWSUITS BUT VERY COSTLY LAWSUITS THAT MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO HAVE MORE WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE. AND SO I'M IT THERE AND I WANNA. BE GRATEFUL TO HER FOR ME ON WHY IT'S NECESSARY TO EXPAND THE APPLICATION OF PAGA IN THIS AREA. IF WE DON'T HAVE VERY VERY PRECISE TERMS AND HAVE ANOTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTION AFTER THAT. SURE -- SO -- BONGOS OF COURSE. APPLIES TO A LOT OF A NUMBER OF VERSIONS OF THE LABOR CODE IT'S NOT WE'RE NOT CREATING A NEW THING HERE. BUT YOU KNOW I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT -- TO HOW THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AND PARTICULARLY BY YEAH THOUGH THE BILL DOES ALLOW THE OPTION OF COMPLETE FIRE COMPLAINT WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER -- NO DISRESPECT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER THAT'S NOT A FAST PROCESS AND IF YOU ARE A WOMAN RETURNED WORKING A LOT TING. THERE'S A TIME HORIZON ON IT IT TAKES A FEW YEARS TO RESOLVE SO BE IT. DOESN'T RESOLVE IN A YOU KNOW A FEW MONTHS SIR. YEAR OR SO -- IT BECOMES MOOTED OUT AND SO -- IF WE DON'T HAVE EFFECTIVE AND MORE EXPEDITIOUS ENFORCEMENT TOOLS LIGHT. EVEN THE THREAT OF A LAWSUIT IN TERMS OF GETTING EMPLOYERS TO COMPLY -- I THINK THIS WILL BECOME VERY VERY HARD TO ENFORCE NOT IMPOSSIBLE VERY HARD -- AND SO THAT THAT'S WHY WE CHOSE. OUGHT TO PUT IN THERE THIS IS A TIME SENSITIVE THING IN THE LABOR COMMISSIONER UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT. A FAST ENOUGH ROUTE TO ENFORCEMENT. AND I THINK APPRECIATE THAT ANNA AND CERTAINLY AGAIN YOU'RE YOU'RE CORRECT BUT THE TIME HORIZON THERE'S NOTHING THAT WOULD KEEP US FROM SAYING THAT THIS HAS TO BE EXPEDITED IN RESOLVED WITHIN. A TWO WEEK THIRTY DAY PERIOD I'M AND AND PUTTING THAT ON THERE I REALIZED I AYE WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A DEBATE ABOUT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER CAMILO QUICKLY THE GRATEFUL THAT APPROPRIATIONS -- IN SERIOUSNESS ALSO YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE HAD AND I'VE WORKED WITH WOMEN HIS RETURN TO THE WORKPLACE AT WHILE LACTATING AFTER THEIR CHILDREN HAVE BEEN BORN AND THEY PREFER MANY THAT I'VE WORKED WITH OVER THERE IT'S EMPLOYEES OR COLLEAGUES AT A LAW FIRM BUT PREFERRED TO HAVE THEIR OWN. SPACE TO BE ABLE TO USE THEIR OFFICE. I THEY THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANOTHER SPACE THEY'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH -- BUT IS SPACES OUR OWN PRIVATE SPACE THEIR OWN OFFICE IN MY READ OF THIS BILL. MAKES EMPLOYER POTENTIALLY SUBJECT TO A POSSIBLE LAWSUIT. IF AN EMPLOYEE CHOOSES. TO USE THEIR OFFICE AND THEY DON'T GO AHEAD AND BUILD THAT SEPARATE SPACE THAT MAY NOT BE. WHAT EMPLOYEES WANT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY FOR REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION WHAT THE HELL OTHER THE REALITY IS IS A LARGE IT? KNOWS WHO DON'T HAVE THEIR OWN. OFFICES OUTSIDE EVEN AND WORK AS A LAWYER I HAD MY OWN OFFICE. SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF STAFF TO WE DIDN'T AND SO AND THE TREND OF COURSE IS NOT AS MOVING MORE MORE AWAY. OFTEN PRIVATE OFFICES SO YES A WOMAN OF COURSE IS THE OPTION OF OF EXPRESSING MILK IN HER OWN OFFICE AND THAT'S HER. CHOICE BUT MOST WOMEN DON'T HAVE A PRIVATE OFFICE BUT I AM REALIZE THAT I AM HAVING HAD EMPLOYEES ALSO IN THAT SITUATION BUT I THE POINT I'M MAKING IS IF THERE IS SPACE THAT WORKS. UNDER IT AND IS A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION FOR BOTH THE EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE IN A BECAUSE ULTIMATELY I WOULD LIKE IS EMPLOYERS TO SUCCEED AND NOT HAVE A DISINCENTIVE TO HIRE WOMEN. NOT HAVE A DISINCENTIVE TO HELP HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BRING MORE WOMEN WHO WANT TO COME INTO THE WORKPLACE AFTER HAVING CHILDREN WE PUT SO MANY BARRIERS UP BEFORE THEM. THAT -- NO BEING FRANKLY RIGID ABOUT WHAT WORK SPACE THEY USE AND HAVE TO BUILD INSTEAD OF ALLOWING THEM TO WORK IT OUT IS -- IS IS AN IMPEDIMENT MY SECOND QUESTION MATES MY THIRD IS DOES THIS APPLY EQUALLY TO STATE EMPLOYERS SO THE SUPPLIES 1100%. UP WE HAVE THE SAME PENALTIES SAN AND OTHERWISE SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL STATE OFFICES ALSO. A A COMEDY AND BUILD NEW SPACE TO DO THIS -- YES AND AND ALSO SCHOOLS CHINA -- COURSE WE PASSED LEGISLATION IN THE PAST THAT WAS TO HELP STUDENTS AND STAFF WHO WERE -- LACTATING TO HAVE A PLACE THAT IS A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION -- FOR EXPRESS MILK I I APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS AND I THINK THE PAGA CONCERNS ARE VALID AND ESPECIALLY FOR GONNA HAVE PAGA. THAT THE TERMINOLOGY JUST HAS TO BE PRECISE -- SO THAT WE ARE NOT ULTIMATELY EXTRACTING RESOURCES FROM THE VERY EMPLOYERS WHO ARE TRYING TO SUPPORT WOMEN RETURNING TO THE WORKPLACE -- THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN. I'M WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE MINI VAN MY MY REMARKS WOULD BE SOMEWHAT ONLINE WITH A MS BAKER'S -- AND I'M SORRY I MISSED THE PEARLY APART THE PRESENTATION BUT IT IS THIS INTENDED TO BE CONJOINED WITH THE THE MOANS SEVENTY SIX WHICH IS OVER.

A INCORPORATED INTO THE ENFORCEMENT SCHEME BECAUSE IF THERE'S NOT -- ON ON AN ISSUE LIKE THIS WHERE SOMEBODY MIGHT FAILED UP A SIGN OR A YOU KNOW. SOMETHING BECAUSE OF OF THAT NATURE AND GETS TAGGED WITH A LAWSUIT -- DOT THAT'S PROBLEMATIC WE WE I THOUGHT IN THERE NOW THAT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE'RE HAPPY TAKE A LOOK AT AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK WITH BUSINESS COMMUNITIES KINDS OF ISSUES.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- THEN WE'LL HEAD BACK TO FILE ITEM NUMBER SEVEN WHICH IS S. BEING. NINE NINE NINE NINE NINE NINE A VERY SIMPLE BILL SELF -- GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. NINE NINE NINE WILL REPEAL SOME VERY LIMITED -- LICENSING REQUIREMENTS FOR BARBERS AND COSMETOLOGIST. THIS IS A BIPARTISAN BILL AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MY SENATE AND ASSEMBLY CALL AUTHORS FOR THEIR SUPPORT [inaudible] CALIFORNIA'S OCCUPATIONAL SYSTEM OF LICENSEE IS INHIBITING THE ECONOMIC MOBILITY OF LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME ENTREPRENEURS WHO ARE FOLK FORCE. TO FOCUS ARE OF VERY EXPENSIVE AND UNNECESSARY OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING TO PROCESS IN ORDER TO MAKE A LIVING -- AS WE'VE RESEARCHED THIS. SOME OF THESE FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS WHICH I'M FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS BUT CHARGE TUITION UP TO TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST. FOR SOME OF THE THINGS LIKE SHAMPOOING HAIR FOR A LICENSE WHICH SEEMS TO BE VERY TOUGH ESPECIALLY. BECAUSE THERE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE AND MOST OF IT TAKES STUDENT LOANS WITH -- YOU KNOW I'M SURE THEY GET JOBS WITH THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT A RECENT STUDY BY THE ARTS PRETTY. IT SHOULD INSTITUTE FOUND. THERE ARE OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING IS LINKED WITH AS MUCH UP TO A FIFTEEN POINT 4% INCREASE -- IN -- INCOME INEQUALITY. IN NINETEEN OR TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN UNDER THE OBAMA PRESIDENCY THE WHITE HOUSE FOUND NEGATIVE OF FACTS OF LICENSING. THAT THE BALK OF THEIR IMPERIAL DATA AND EVIDENCE SHOW THAT LICENSING DOES NOT PROMOTE A BETTER QUALITY OR SAFETY STANDARDS. AGAIN UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA'S ADMINISTRATION TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SAID IT SERVES AS A BARRIER. TO ENTRY FOR MINORITY AND LOW INCOME WORKERS TO ENTER THE JOB MARKET. THERE IS NO BETTER EXAMPLE OF THIS THEN IN CALIFORNIA'S WE SEE IN THE IN THIS LEASE FEELS IN ORDER TO PROFESSIONALLY ARRANGED DRESS AND WAY OR SHAMPOO HERE AS AN EXAMPLE. GET THIS CALIFORNIA LICENSING REQUIRES INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED HOURS OF TRAINING. PAST TWO EXAMS ONE EXAMS A WRITTEN EXAM. ANOTHER ONE THEY CALL A PRACTICAL EXAMINATION THEN PAY UP TO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER YEAR AND FEES. BUT GET THIS IS WE RESEARCH THESE DIFFERENT WEBSITES. THE TUITION STAY SHAMPOO HAIR RANGES ANYWHERE FROM. SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TUITION. IT'S A LOT OF MONEY FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE I THINK FOLKS -- MOM SP NINE NINE NINE FOCUSES ONLY ON THESE PRACTICES AND DOES NOT TARGET. THE ENTIRE SCOPE OF PRACTICE. AND CALL US MY TOP POLITICS AS THE OPPOSITION HAS. ARM HAS MISREPRESENTED IT -- THIS BILL DOES NOT GO AFTER BARBERS ARE THEY ARE -- INDUSTRY OR ANY OTHER INDUSTRY FOR THAT. BOMB. MATTER BUT RATHER ATTEMPTS TO HELP THOSE TRAIN INTO THE INDUSTRY AGAIN THIS SYSTEM IS ABOUT ACCESS TO WORK THAT'S ALL IT IS THIS BILL. IS WERE TRYING TO MAKE IT SO PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO WORK. BECAUSE THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS LIVE EXPRESSES TOO EXPENSIVE. THESE OCCUPATIONS ARE ON LICENSE WITH NO REPORTEDLY DETRIMENTAL AFFECTS IN OTHER STATES THESE LICENSE REQUIREMENTS ARE GOVERNMENT SPONSOR BARRIER TO COMPETITION. THE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL HAS CITED THE FACT THAT NEXT YEAR THE BOARD -- THEIR BOARD IS UP FOR SUNSET REVIEW AND THIS ISSUE CAN BE ADDRESSED THEM HOWEVER I DISAGREE THAT IT SEEMS LIKE. ONCE SOMETHING HAS PUT IN THE LAW IT VERY RARELY IS RESCINDED SO THERE'S NO REASON. THAT THIS COMPLETELY SAFE PRO PART OF THAT DISCUSSION ON LICENSING WE SHOULD MAKE THESE CHANGES NOW IN FREE UP THESE PRACTICES. FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WORK THE OPPOSITION IS ALSO CLAIM THAT IF WE DE REGULATE WE WILL SEE AN INCREASE AN UNLICENSED BEHAVIOR. AND PEOPLE SAYING THEY ARE ONLY PRACTICING SHAMPOO WHEN IN REALITY. THEY'RE DOING A MULTITUDE OF MANY OTHER THINGS [inaudible] HOWEVER -- THESE INDIVIDUALS STILL. WILL BE WORKING IN LICENSE ALIGNS. WITH OWNERS WHO HAVE LICENSE WHO OVERSEE THEIR WORK AND THERE ARE OF COURSE WILL BE RESPONSIVE ONCE. A OPPONENTS ALSO CLAIM THAT THE CURRENT. LICENSE REQUIREMENTS INCLUDE TRAINING ON SPOTTING SCALP DISEASES AND THEY ARGUE THAT THE LICENSING WILL LEAD TO POTENTIAL OVERSIGHTS IN THIS AREA. BUT ONE THING I JUST WANT TO MAKE CLEAR BY NO MEANS -- IN THIS TRAINING DO THEY RECEIVE ANY KIND OF IN DEPTH MEDICAL TRAINING -- IN THEIR COURSES TO IDENTIFYTHAT NOT ALSO IF I WAS AN OWNER OF A SALON -- I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT MAKE IT ADVISABLE TO HAVE MY STAFF ATTEMPTING TO IDENTIFY. AND POINT OUT DISEASES BECAUSE OF COULD POSE A SERIOUS LIABILITY. ON THE PART OF THE OWNER IN AND ALSO REMEMBER -- THERE ASK IN THE SHAMPOO WORST. TO HAVE THIS EDUCATION. BUT THE LICENSE BEAUTICIANS AND BARBERS ALREADY HAVE THIS LICENSE SO IF THEY WANT. TO POINT OUT THEY CAN'T AND BY THE WAY ON ON THIS THING ON SHAMPOOING. VERSES. BARBERINI. WE MY STAFF TOOK -- FORTY HAIR SALONS IN EVERYBODY'S DISTRICT AND IT WAS RARE TO FIND ANY COMPLAINTS ON YELP. THAT PEOPLE HAVE ON SHAMPOOING BUT WE FOUND A LOT. ON PEOPLE WHO CUT HAIR AND YOU KNOW THE PETITIONS -- AND THOSE WERE LICENSE PEOPLE BUT SO FAR SHAMPOOING THEY WERE VERY CLEAN -- DAMAGE OVERWHELMING HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS AND WILL NOT OLLIER AREAS BUT AS WE TOTAL A MOP AND IT WAS WITH PEOPLE WHO HAD LICENSE SO AGAIN I THINK IT'S UNFAIR. TO TALK ABOUT -- THAT THERE'S GREAT PROBLEMS HERE WAS SHAMPOOING HERE. OR CURRENTLY IN HERE. HE ARE NOT THANK -- SO WE SHOULD NOT EXPECT OR SHAMPOO IS TO SERVE AS A ROLL OF DOCTORS IN OUR SOCIETY WHICH WAS KINDA POINTED OUT TO ME BY. BY THE THEIR ASSOCIATION BUT ANY WE AGAIN WE WANT TO MAKE THIS EASY WE WANT TO MAKE IT ACCESS FOR FOR PEOPLE GETTING IN THE BUSINESS. FOR THEMSELVES AND MOVING THEM UP THE LADDER SO SALON AT SOME TIME AND THEN GO THROUGH THE LICENSING PROCESS OF COURSE SO NO ONE'S TRYING TO TAKE THAT AWAY. A BY REPEALING THESE REQUIREMENTS S. B. NINE NINE NINE WOULD INCREASE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THESE BILLS. REDUCE RESTRICTIONS. AND ON BUSINESS OWNERS AND SET UP A A POSITIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS DEREGULATING CERTAIN OCCUPATIONS IN THE SPIRIT OF FREE OTHER ENTERPRISE. AND LASTLY I I JUST WANT TO CLOSE WITH THIS THAT THAT WERE I THINK WERE HARMING PEOPLE IN THIS ENTRY LEVEL FEEL AND AND WE WANT TO HELP PEOPLE TO TO CLIMB THE LADDER OF SUCCESS. IN AGAIN WITH THESE LICENSING FEES A FIFTEEN HOURS FIFTEEN HUNDRED HOURS I MEAN -- TO TEST IN UP TO NINETEEN THOUSAND INTUITION AND MOST THAT'S PAID THROUGH STUDENT LOANS IS VERY COSTLY AND SO IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME. THE WINNERS HERE ARE THE BARBER -- SCHOOLS MANY BEAUTY SCHOOLS WHICH I THINK YOU KNOW I'M A FREE MARKET ECONOMY GUY BUT AGAIN I THINK WE HAVE TOO MANY LICENSING. FEES WE WANT TO MAKE ACCESS EASY AND SO THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS AND HERE TO TESTIFY. ON THIS MEASURE IS DAVID LEFT REPRESENTING THE OUR ST INSTITUTE IF YOU WOULD DAVID YES IF YOU COULD JUST POSITIVE FROM OWN SO WE CAN A SUBSEQUENT. LOW HERE VOEPEL [inaudible] YOU [inaudible] ARAMBULA [inaudible] BAKER [inaudible] BLOOM [inaudible] CHEN [inaudible] JILL [inaudible] CUNNINGHAM [inaudible] EGGMAN [inaudible] FONG [inaudible] GIPSON [inaudible] GRAYSON [inaudible] HOLDEN [inaudible] IRWIN [inaudible] MEDINA [inaudible] MULLIN [inaudible] OBERNOLTE [inaudible] TING. CRITIC YOU'VE IMAGE WE HAVE NOW IS THAT IS A QUORUM AND UP TO TWO MINUTES FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT COUNTY PLEASE PRETTY PLEASE SIR PRESENTMENT EVERY READY. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TO MORNING DAVID WOLF TODAY REPRESENTING OUR STUDENTS TO WEAR THE SPONSORS OF S. B.. NINE NINE NINE OUR STUDENTS TO HEAT IS A NONPROFIT NONPARTISAN NATIONWIDE THINK TANK ORGANIZATION THAT SPECIALIZES IN FREE MARKET INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY ISSUES. IS TOPICS COVER A WIDE RANGE OF INTERESTS RANGING FROM BAYLOR FARM IN PUBLIC SAFETY TO ECONOMIST VEHICLES IN THE GIG ECONOMY AND ESPECIALLY MEMBERS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY. OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING AS IT REGARDS VARIOUS APPLICATIONS OF HER STYLE AND MEMBERS A SENATOR MERLE NOTED THERE IS IN FACT A BARRIER TO ENTRY REGARDING HER STYLING APPLICATIONS LISTED IN S. B.. NINE NINE NINE RIGHT NOW IF YOU WANT TO SHARE PREPARE ENGAGING OTHER DRIVE OUR SERVICES THE PLACE ZERO REST ON PUBLIC SAFETY AS SENATOR MORALE MENTION YOU NEED AT LEAST FIFTEEN HUNDRED HOURS. OF EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS IN NEED TO PASS TWO EXAMS. MEANWHILE YOU NEED FAR LESS TRAINING TO BECOME AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN -- FOR THOSE JUST STARTING OUT OR WHO WANT TO BASIC JOB A SAWN SHAMPOOING ARRANGING OR CURLING HAIR THIS DOES INDEED REPRESENT. A DIFFICULT BARRIER TO ENTRY. SOME CONFUSED OUR STREETS INVOLVEMENT IN S. B. NINE NINE NINE IS THE FIRST STEP IN A PROCESS TO UP AND THE BAR BRINGING COSMETOLOGY CODE SECTION. TODAY THEY SAY IT SHAMPOOING TOMORROW THEY SAID SOMETHING ELSE. BUT THAT'S NOT OUR AGENDA MEMBERS IT COMES DOWN TO A SIMPLE BUT FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING. IS THE POINTS TO CREATE A FORMER PROTECTIONISM THAT ESTABLISHES THE BARRIER TO ENTRY OR IS THE GOAL TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY. WE BELIEVE THE FOCUS SHOULD BE ON THE LATTER WHICH IS WHY HER CUTTING HAIR DIALING CHEMICAL PEELS AND A HOST OF OTHER PROFESSIONS ARE NOT IN THIS BILL. THE HAIRSTYLING APPLICATIONS THAT ARE LISTED FOR EXEMPTION S. B. NINE NINE NINE WERE CAREFULLY CHOSEN BECAUSE THEY INVOLVE ABSOLUTE ZERO RISK TO PUBLIC SAFETY. OR OTHER APPLICATIONS LIKE SHAMPOOING HER CURLING THAT PEOPLE DO OF PRODUCTS THAT CAN BE FOUND IN A WALMART. AGAIN IN CLOSING WE BELIEVE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SPEND A YEAR OF YOUR LIFE AND NINETEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF CHAMPAGNE AND STYLING HARRIS CURRENT I'VE UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHENEVER READY. GOOD MORNING ASSEMBLY MEMBER IF MY NAME IS DOCTOR CARY WILLIAMS AND I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE BORDER BARRING A COSMETOLOGY Y. CURRENTLY SERVE AS THE BOARD PRESIDENT. HAVE A DOCTORATE IN PSYCHOLOGY WHICH IS A BRANCH OF THEIR MENTALITY THAT FOCUSES ON THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF HARRIS OUT DISORDERS. I'M A LICENSED BARBER HERE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THIRTEEN YEARS AS WELL AS A SALON OWNER IN BEVERLY HILLS CALIFORNIA. AND WE'D TAKEN OPPOSED POSITION ON S. B. NINETY NINE OUT BRIEFLY HIGHLIGHT Y.. I AM I AM HERE AS A WITNESS THAT HAVING A LICENSE IN THIS INDUSTRY HAS AFFORDED ME SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES. I AM I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH A NUMBER OF CELEBRITY CLIENTS AS WELL AS TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD AS A RESULT OF MY LIFE THINGS -- WE BELIEVE THAT THE BORDER BOBBING COSMETOLOGY THAT. WE DO NOT HAVE PARTISAN VERY BURDENSOME BARRIERS TO ENTRY ARE STATE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT HAS ENCOURAGED MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA TO PURSUE THIS VIBRANT INDUSTRY AND ESTABLISH LIFE LONG CAREERS -- A NUMBER OF ISSUES ARE PRESENTED IT IS GOING TO SHAMPOO PROCESS THAT WE ACTUALLY ASSESSED TO HELP IN. THE HEALTH OF A CLIENT HERE AND SCOUT IT IS HERE THAT WE DETECT WHERE WE DETERMINE AND IDENTIFY COMMON SCALP DISORDERS LIKE DANDRUFF. AND BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHICH PRODUCTS IN THE INGREDIENTS IN THOSE PRODUCTS BUT HELP US TO SERVE OUR CLIENTS I THINK THE MISTAKE THAT OF THE MAKE IT THAT IS BEING MADE HERE IS THAT SAMPLING IS NOT IT ALA CARTE SERVICE BUT IT IS A PART OF IT. OF A COMPLETE SERVICE. TYPICALLY CLIENTS DO NOT COME INTO THE SALON AND REQUEST SHAMPOO ONLY AS A SERVICE IT IS PART OF A SHAMPOO BLOW DRY SERVICE IT IS A PART OF A COLOR SERVICE INTO THE PART OF RELAX OR SERVICE. SO WE ARE CONCERNED THAT IT WILL INCREASE UNLICENSED ACTIVITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ADDITIONALLY IN OUR ON DEMAND SOCIETY AND NUMBER OF CLIENTS ARE NOW SAVING TIME IN THE SALON. BY SHAMPOOING THEIR HAIR AT CLIENTS COME INTO THE SLIME REQUESTING THE SERVICE ALONE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANY MONEY TO BE MADE IN THE BUSINESS OF SAMPLING OF A LOT OF LARGE CHAINS WANTS NO LONGER OFFER THE SERVICE LIKE DR BARS IN ADDITION. IN ADDITION THE BOARD CURRENTLY HAS OVER SIX HUNDRED FOURTEEN THOUSAND LICENSEES WITH OVER FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY THREE THOUSAND OF THOSE BEING LICENSE INDIVIDUALS LIKE MYSELF WE HAVE MULTIPLE PATHWAYS TO INTRUDE INTO THIS INDUSTRY AS A RESULT WE DO NOT BELIEVE WE HAVE BARRIERS TO ENTRY. INDIVIDUALS CAN ATTEND PRIVATE SCHOOLS COMMUNITY COLLEGES WERE BEGINNING APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM WHERE INDIVIDUALS CAN EARN AN INCOME WHILE OBTAINING ON THE JOB TRAINING. IT SUPPORTS ALSO KNOW THAT THE NATIONAL INTERSTATE COUNCIL WHICH PROVIDES OUR EXAM FOR LICENSEES HAVE CONFIRMED THAT IF WE LOSE THESE PROCEDURES WE CANNOT PROVIDE THE TEST TO OUR LICENSEES BECAUSE THIS IS AN INTRAPARTY OF OUR EXAM. AND THIS WILL THREATEN OUR STATE TO STATE RECIPROCITY. YOU VERY MUCH -- AS NO ONE USES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. MY NAME IS SUE CABRAL EVERT AND I AM THE PRESIDENT OF IATSE LOCAL SEVEN NO. SIX THE UNION THAT PRETTY CREATES THE CHARACTERS YOU WATCH ON FILM AND TELEVISION. OR GIVE HUGS HUGS TO AT DISNEYLAND. SENATE BILL NINE NINE NINE MAY SEEM ON PRESENTATION BE HARMLESS TO THE CONSUMER. BUT IN CALIFORNIA WE ALSO EMPLOY A HIGHLY SKILLED COSMETOLOGY LICENSED HAIR STYLIST. IN THE FILM AND TELEVISION INDUSTRY AND AT THE DISNEYLAND RESORT. IN OUR IATSE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT THE A BASIC AGREEMENT THE NETWORK TELEVISION. AND THE DISNEYLAND RESORT AGREEMENTS IT IS REQUIRED THAT. ELIGIBILITY FOR UNION MEMBERSHIP OR PLACEMENT ON THE PRODUCERS INDUSTRY EXPERIENCED ROSTER REQUIRES A FULL COSMETOLOGY LICENSE. BARBOUR LICENSES ARE NOT ALLOWED WITHIN THE CBA HOWEVER COSMETOLOGY LICENSES FROM OTHER STATES AND CERTIFICATIONS. AND EVEN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE PERMITTED. EVEN THOUGH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOES EXEMPTS THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY FROM THE COSMETOLOGY REQUIREMENT. THE UNION CBA'S FOR FILM TELEVISION AND DISNEY LAND ALL REQUIRE A LICENSE OR EMPLOYERS HAVE AN EXPECTATION OF TRAINING. PROVIDED BY THE COSMETOLOGY ACT TO SAFEGUARD OUR INDUSTRY AND THOSE QUALIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR DECADES. WE RELY ON THAT EDUCATION AS A FOUNDATION. WITHIN FILM AND TELEVISION WE ALSO ACCEPT COSMETOLOGY LICENSES FROM OTHER AREAS. BUT THEY MUST HAVE EQUAL EDUCATION. AND IF IT PUTS OUR CALIFORNIA HAIRSTYLISTS AT RISK THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO WORK.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND IT JUST KNOW IF I COULD ASK YOU. TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF AT ANY ADDITIONAL. WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION SEEING NO DISH NO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION -- NOW FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ASSEMBLY ROOM WOMAN BAKER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SENATOR I THINK HE DEFTLY HAVE THE RIGHT GOAL AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT I APPRECIATE GETTING. TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY THIS WITH YOU ABOUT THE BILL AND THEY BARRIERS THAT OUR STATE PUTS FORWARD BOTH IN TERMS OF COST AND TIME TO ENTER. LIVELIHOOD AND ENTERPRISE -- I DO HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT AND I JUST WANT -- TO GIVEN OPPORTUNITY. TO DETAIL AND WITH IT THE YOU MENTION THE TUITION IS EXPENSIVE IN THIS IS A BIG PART OF IT THE BILL DOESN'T ADDRESS THAT POINT AND I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT THERE IS IN MY VIEW A PURPOSE TO THE TRAINING I VISITED WITH FOLKS IN MY DISTRICT BOTH APOLO DRIVE BARS. WHERE IT'S NOT ANY CUTTING OR OTHER -- ACTUAL ANYTHING OTHER THAN SHAMPOOING IN A VARIETY OF STYLING THERE'S NO CUTTING. AND AND IN SALONS WHERE THEY'VE HAD TO HAVE THE FULL TRAINING THERE'S A PURPOSE TO THE TRAINING THAT'S BEYOND -- BEING ABLE TO BLOW DRY NICELY IF YOU'VE BEEN TO APPLE DRIVE OUR WERE THAT'S ALL THEY DO YOU. AS IT LOOKED LIKE I COULD HAVE DONE WELL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I I HAVE. I I I DON'T HAVE AS MUCH HERE AS I THAT I HAVE I GOT TODAY PROP QUITE OBVIOUSLY NOT TODAY BUT AYE I I HAVE. AND KNOW THAT THEY ARE. TOUCHING YOU YOUR SCALP YOUR SKIN YOUR HAIR THE TRAINING IS NOT ONLY FOR IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL HOW TO BE EITHER MORE GENTLE OR OTHERWISE ADDRESS THE SCALP BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A CURLING IRON YOU WANT THE PURSE. SURE THEY DON'T BURN YOU TO BURN YOUR HAIR TO BURN YOUR SKIN TO BRING YOUR FACE. AND THAT'S PART OF THE TRAINING THAT COMES FROM THE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS. AND AND THE SANITATION OF COURSE YOU MENTIONED THAT. A LICENSED A LICENSE HOLDER WILL OWN THE BUSINESS IN HIS HAVE THE TRAIN ON THE VISITOR. ANY OPENNESS TO REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY HAVE TO TRAIN THEIR EMPLOYEES ON THAT [inaudible] WELL [inaudible] I'M. YEARS AGO I I DON'T A NUMBER OF BUSINESSES [inaudible] AND I YOU NOTICE THEY ARE REQUIRED LICENSE WHERE THEY HAD TRAINING ONE THING I NOTICE -- GOING TO SCHOOL GET NEAR REAL ESTATE LICENSE OR YOUR LAND THE LICENSE I HAVE A LENDING COMPANY THAT DIDN'T MAKE YOUR PROFESSIONAL WE ALWAYS HAD ONGOING TRAINING. I LEARNED THAT EARLY ON THAT THAT YOU DON'T DEPEND ON JUST GET THE LICENSE TAKEN A CLASS. BUT YOU KNOW IT'S GOOD TO HAVE GOOD SUPERVISION AARON AND LIFE'S CONSTANTLY ON GOING TRAINING AND THAT'S WHAT. I THINK MAKES FOR A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSES AND SO ON IT'S A LICENSE DOESN'T MAKE. A A PEOPLE PROP UP ONE OF THAT THE THINKS AGAIN THAT I I JUST WANT TO STRESS WERE JUST TRYING TO MAKE THIS EASY ACCESS AND AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT BUT ONE ONE THING THAT SORT OF ALARMS ME IS THIS YOUNG LADY HERE ARTICULATED I WROTE IT DOWN. SHE SAID THERE'S NO MONEY TO BE MADE AND SHAMPOOING PAMBA YET AGAIN WERE MAKING IT VERY HARD WITH. THE LICENSEE HANNAH AND HER TUITION THAT KIND THANKS SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT REALLY CONCERN ME. BECAUSE AGAIN WE WANT OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL IN OUR STATE AND IN AGAIN YOU KNOW THE HIGH THE HOOVER INSTITUTE SAID DID THE LARGEST DOWN ONE OF THE LARGEST DEMOGRAPHICS OF PEOPLE EVEN OUR STATE. ARE HIGHLY EDUCATED YOUNG PROFESSIONALS BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY NINE WERE LEAVING CALIFORNIA FOR GREENER PASTURES AND AGAIN YOU KNOW THAT. TOP FIVE HUNDRED SEALS TWELVE YEARS AND LOCAL PLACES DO BUSINESS AND IT ISN'T JUST HIGH TAXES NUMBER ONE IS REGULATORY STATE AND SO HAPPY THAT THIS JUST STANDS IN THE WAY. AGAIN THE PEOPLE ON OPPORTUNITY AT A VERY PRICEY. THING AND SO FAR IS THAT CURLING IRON THING I CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU THERE BUT MY GOODNESS -- I'VE BEEN MARRIED GOING ON FORTY ONE YEARS AND MY WIFE. USES A CURLING IRON MOST DAYS AND I DON'T KNOW SHE'S EVER HAD A PROBLEM I DON'T. YOU KNOW I MEAN I CAN ASK SOME YOU GUYS OUT BUT WELL I CAN ANSWER THAT FOR YOU SO -- IT'S IT'S SAYING THAT IF YOU RAISE I MEAN I KNOW WE DON'T GOVERN BY ANECDOTES THAT WAY BUT I HAD IT IS EASY TO BURN YOURSELF YEAH ON IT IF YOU DO IT EVERY DAY AND TO TO TO HURT ONESELF BECAUSE THIS IS. SOMETHING WHERE YOUR BODY IS INVOLVED THAT'S RIGHT. I GUESS MY CONCERN ABOUT THE BILL IS IT A COMPLETELY GETS RID OF ANY TRAINING OR LICENSING AND WE'VE HAD EFFORTS THAT MAY BE APPROPRIATE DURING THE SUNSET PROCESS OF OF OF PERHAPS HAVING STEPS I THINK IT WITH ATHLETIC TRAINERS WE'VE CHANGED THAT THERE DOES HAVE TO BE A FULL. LICENSE BUT THERE CAN BE. A A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOURS REQUIRED SO THAT THE PERSON WHO'S GONNA BE TOUCHING ANOTHER PERSON'S BODY. AND HAVING INSTRUMENTS AROUND THEM HAS TO HAVE. SOME MINIMUM AMOUNT OF OF TRAINING ASIDE FROM THE SANITATION I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WOULD BE OPEN TO THAT WELL. THAT WOULD BE THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF THE SALON OWNER. I MEAN TO BE TRAINING. THERE PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW JUST TO SHAMPOO AND A WATCH OUT FOR THOSE THINGS ON A REGULAR BASIS THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE. OFFICE MEETINGS AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK AND THAT TYPE OF THING. AND SO AGAIN I I THINK IT'S OVER KILL. ON THE LICENSING BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS I SAID IN MY OPENING STATEMENT IS MY STAFF -- EVERY SINGLE DISTRICT HERE THEY LET THE FORTY HAIR SALONS AND THERE WAS REALLY NO COMPLAINTS THAT THERE WERE TWO OUT OF THE HUNDREDS THAT WE SEARCH -- NUMBER WAS ON BEING BURNED BY CURLING IRON -- OR BAD SHAMPOOING BUT AGAIN WE DID FIND HUNDREDS OF OF PEOPLE HAD BAD HAIR CUTS AND WERE UNHAPPY WITHOUT KNOWS OUR LICENSE PEOPLE THAT'S ON TRYING. TO NOT NOT RANKING ON ANY PROFESSION HERE I'M JUST SAYING YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA WE MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO COMPETE THIS IS A HUGE BARRIER OF THIS IS A LOT OF MONEY. FOR THE ENTER THIS FIELD SO AGAIN IT'S ABOUT ACCESS. I'M I I THINK YOU MAKE SOME VERY GOOD POINTS I WITH THE LEGISLATION EVEN IN THE BURDEN THAT CALIFORNIA IS AND I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR EFFORT TO TAKE A CRACK AT IT IN THIS WHEN I FRIENDLY ENCOURAGEMENT THAT THERE MAY BE AT IN BETWEEN MEASURE THAT WE MIGHT -- TAKE IF THIS. IT HAS TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY WHICH IS A PART OF THE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AS WELL. AND INVITE YOU TO COME TO MY DISTRICT IN AND VISIT THE THE BOTH THE BLOW DRY SALONS AND OTHERWISE THAT ARE AND ARE DOING A GREAT JOB. AND SOMEONE IS ABLE TO LEAVE UNHARMED AND WELL TAKEN CARE OF BUT THEM I THINK YOU FOR TACKLING THE ISSUE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO DO -- AND HOPE THERE CAN BE AN IN BETWEEN MEASURE PERHAPS IN IN THE FUTURE THINK LONGEST CLOUT I GOT HERE THIS MORNING THOUGHT THIS BILL WOULD BE CONTENTIOUS AND IT'S NOT SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS SENATOR MORRELL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YOU KNOW THIS IS A REALLY INTERESTING ISSUE BECAUSE IT. DEALS WITH THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN -- TO IDEAS THAT OUR INTENTION THE IDEA OF REGULATION AND THE IDEA OF PROTECTION OF OUR CONSUMER SAFETY SO. I I I THINK IT'S A VERY MEANINGFUL BUILT -- I I WOULD AGREE WITH TECH NET I THINK THAT. THE CURRENT REGULATORY STRUCTURE IS -- TOO RIGID AND THAT IT BLOCKS INNOVATION IN THIS FIELD AND I WANNA REMIND EVERYONE THAT WHEN WE STAND IN THE WAY OF INNOVATION AND BUSINESS MODELS. ARE THE CONSUMER IS THE ONE THAT SUFFERS. RIGHT THAT WE WE WE HAVE TO WORLD YOU KNOW A A WORLD WHERE WE ARE ALLOW INNOVATION IN A WORLD WHERE WE DON'T AND WE'RE WHEN WE'RE ALLOWING INNOVATION THAT MEANS PEOPLE CAN GET SERVICES THEY WANT -- IN IN WAYS THAT ARE EASIER FOR THEM AND WAYS THAT COST THEM LESS MONEY SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION AND STILL PROTECT CONSUMER SAFETY I THINK WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION. TO CALIFORNIANS TO DO THAT AND I THINK THAT YOUR BILL MOVES US IN THAT DIRECTION I'LL CERTAINLY BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY. BUT I WANT TO ENCOURAGE EVERYONE THAT SHOULD THE BILL NOT MOVE FORWARD TO THAT THIS NOT BE THE END OF THE DISCUSSION BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT THE BOARD HAS BEEN CONSIDERING -- A PERSONAL SERVICES PERMIT THAT WOULD PERMIT A NARROW RANGE OF SERVICES OUTSIDE OF THE SETTING A PHYSICAL SO ON I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT THING. FOR THEM TO BE CONSIDERING AND ESPECIALLY AS WE'RE MOVING INTO THE SUNSET REVIEW NEXT YEAR. I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE SECONDS PROPOSITION TO CONTINUE SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL AND I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD SENATORS [inaudible] THANK YOU. SETTLING ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY WOMAN IRWIN. YEAH I AGREE WITH A LOT OF WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID TODAY I I THINK YOU BRING UP SOME VERY GOOD POINTS AND AND CERTAINLY WE DON'T WANT OVER REGULATION. A BARRIER TO ENTRY [inaudible] OF BUT I DO THINK THAT THE MORE APPROPRIATE TIME TO EXPLORE THIS SUBJECT FURTHER IS AND DURING THE SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS BUT I I I THINK YOU NEED TO CONTINUE ON THIS SUBJECT. BUT TODAY I WON'T BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL BUT APPRECIATE -- THE DISCUSS. YOUR YOU KNOW BY THE WAY ON THE SUNSET THE WAY. I'VE SEEN SHORT TIME I'VE BEEN IN. SACRAMENTO WHICH HAS BEEN I PASSED MY SEVEN HERE -- FEW THINGS EVER GET SUNSET AND SO THIS IS THIS IS HERE AND NOW I WANT TO PROVIDE MORE JOBS FOR PEOPLE. MAKE IT EASIER ACCESS IN AGAIN YOU KNOW WHEN I FIRST. GOT IN THE MY BUSINESS YEARS AGO IT WAS FINE YOU NEED JUST ONE LICENSE YOU KNOW AND THEN YOU CAN GO AND DO DEALS AND AND OVER THE YEARS JUST MORE COMPLIANCE MORE COMPLIANCE. MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT AND TODAY NUMBER PEOPLE GOTTEN OUT OF THAT THE TRADE I WAS IN AND AND SO CALIFORNIA NO GOVERNMENT. IS SUPPOSED TO ARE NOT STIFLE PRO BUT PRODUCTIVITY BUT SUPPOSED TO FOSTER IT AND THESE ARE HUGE HURDLES. AND WHAT IT DOES IS IS MY FRIEND -- FROM BIG BEAR CITED OUT IT DOES DRIVE THE PRICE UP FOR CONSUMER WITH THIS KIND A LICENSING THEY'RE GONNA HAVE. TO CHARGE MORE AND AND NOT AIR YOU KNOW MY SON IN LAW NOW CUTS HIS [inaudible] BOYS HAIR. HE DOESN'T DO A VERY GOOD JOB BY THE WAY BUT BUT NEVERTHELESS YOU KNOW THERE THERE THERE ON A TIGHT. THERE ON A TIGHT. SCOPE AND AND THEY HAVE TO DO IT BECAUSE THINGS ARE JUST PRICEY AND AND SO -- YOU KNOW THAT IT DOES PUSH PEOPLE. OUT OF OUR BEING AND GET THOSE HAIRCUTS BUT THANKS FOR YOUR COMMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME.

BACKGROUNDS AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN CALIFORNIA'S RECENT LEGALIZE ADULT USE CANNABIS INDUSTRY A BURGEONING INDUSTRY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. S. B. TWELVE NINETY FOUR WILL HELP ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF CREATING AN EQUITABLE INDUSTRY BY PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. AND TRAINING TO LOCAL APPLICANTS AS WELL AS REQUIRING THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL TO CREATE A STATE TASK FORCE TO ADVISE TO BE YOUR RURAL ON DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING. A STATEWIDE EQUITY PROGRAM CITIES SUCH AS OAKLAND SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES IN SACRAMENTO HAVE CREATED THEIR OWN EQUITY PROGRAM WHICH FOCUSES ON INCLUSION IN SUPPORT FOR APPLICATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN. AND APPLICANTS I SHOULD SAY THAT HAVE BEEN HARMED BY DECADES OF THE WAR ON DRUGS SPACEY PEOPLE OF COLOR. POWER. ONLY FOR CITIES HAVE A STAB EQUITY PROGRAM AND NO SUCH PROGRAM EXIST ON THE STATE LEVEL FOR TOO MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE BEING EXCLUDED. FROM THIS GROWING INDUSTRY I INDUSTRY AGAIN THAT'S ONLY EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN EXISTENCE BUT IT'S PRETTY MUCH 80% WHITE MALE DOMINATED. THE MOST URGENT SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES ARE ACCESS TO CAPITAL LACK OF TECHNICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND DELIVERY COLLABORATION BETWEEN THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY. PART OF THE INDUSTRY AND THOSE WHO ARE SEEKING AN ENTRY INTO THE INDUSTRY UNDER THIS BILL THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL OF SAYS EQUITY APPLICANTS. AND LICENSEES IN CONDUCTING TRAINING AND INFORMATION SESSIONS ON STATE AND LOCAL LICENSING PROCESS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY UPON APPROPRIATIONS OF FUNDING. ALLOW LOCALITIES TO APPLY FOR GRANTS TO THE BUREAU WHICH WILL DIRECTLY BENEFIT APPLICANTS WITH REDUCED AND WAVED LICENSING FEES. THE BUREAU ALSO REQUIRED TO COLLECT AND REPORT DATA ON ALLOCATION IN USE OF FUNDING BY LOCAL EQUITY PROGRAMS AND DEMOGRAPHICS ON APPLICANTS. AN INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE TO MEASURE PROGRAMS OF THE PROGRAM'S EFFECTIVENESS CALIFORNIA'S ALWAYS BEEN. ARE A NATIONAL LEADER.

TWELVE NINETY FOUR THE CANNABIS COLLABORATION? AND INCLUSION ACT YOU KNOW IT'S ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE HOW WE ARRIVED AT THIS POINT I STARTED TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS I JUST A SHORT WHILE AGO CANNABIS WAS CRIMINALIZED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WAS ESPECIALLY DEVASTATING FOR PERSONS OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS ARE BUT SINCE PROP SIXTY FOUR PASSED A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR RECREATIONAL CAN'T BRETT RECREATIONAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY. HAS BEEN CREATED IN THE STATE AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK WITHIN IT ARE CONSTANTLY DEVELOPING. UNSURPRISINGLY THOUGH ALLTHESE OPPORTUNITIES RELEASE ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE -- FROM COMMUNITIES MOST HARMED BY CANNABIS PROHIBITION ALSO BECAUSE WE AT THE OUTSET OF THIS INDUSTRY HOW WE MUST ENSURE THAT THIS MARKET IS ONE THAT IS BOTH EQUITABLE AND ACCESSIBLE AYE AND WHAT S. B. TWELVE NINETY FOUR CAN I DO FOR US IS THAT CAN OFFER FOLKS AN OPPORTUNITY. I LIKE NEVER BEFORE TO SUCCEED AND AN EMERGING INDUSTRY NOW MANY LOCALITIES HAVE BEGUN TO ENGAGE IN THIS PROCESS BY CREATING LOCAL EQUITY PROGRAMS AND THE STATE IS WELL POSITIONED TO SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS. AND TAKE THEM TO THE NEXT LEVEL I ONE OF THE STATED PURPOSE IS AN INTENSIVE PROP SIXTY FOUR WAS ACTUALLY TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO ENTERING OF THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY. AND S. B.

THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SENATE BILL FOURTEEN FIFTY ONE RELATING TO THE SALE OF CANNABIS TO MINORS. THANK YOU LET ME ALSO START BY SAYING I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND I THINK THE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE. SB FOURTEEN FIFTY ONE SIX TO IMPOSE A MINIMUM PENALTY STANDARD ON ANY LICENSEE WHO CELLS ARE PERNICIOUS CANNABIS OR CANNABIS PRODUCTS TO A PERSON UNDER THE LEGAL AGE. THE BUREAU OF CANADA'S CONTROLS PRESENTLY AUTHORIZED TO SUSPEND OR REVOKE A LICENSE FOR ANY ACT CONSTITUTING GROUNDS FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION INCLUDING ILLEGAL CANNABIS SALES. IN DETERMINING WHAT PENALTY TO IMPOSE IN A GIVEN CASE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL MAY CONSIDER A MULTITUDE OF FACTORS. THE BUREAU RECENTLY ADOPTED GUIDELINES TO PROMOTE CONSISTENCY AND DISCIPLINARY ORDERS AGAINST CANNABIS BUSINESSES THAT HAVE VIOLATED THE LAW. HOWEVER DISCIPLINARY ACTION IS TAKEN AT THE BUREAU'S DISCRETION. S. B. FOURTEEN FIFTY ONE GOES BEYOND THE BUREAU'S GUIDELINES BY STATUTORILY MANDATING A FIFTEEN DAY SUSPENSION FOR THE FIRST VIOLATION. AND REVOCATION FOR THIRD VIOLATION OCCURRING ON THE SAME PREMISES WITHIN THIRTY SIX MONTHS. S. B. FOURTEEN FIFTY ONE DOES NOT PROHIBIT THE BUREAU FROM REVOKING A LICENSE PRIOR TO THE THIRD VIOLATION. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THESE ARE THE MINIMUM PENALTIES TO BE IMPOSED AND DO NOT PRECLUDE ANY ADDITIONAL DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN BY THE BUREAU FOR THESE ACTS. MEMBERS AS THE AVAILABILITY AND THE POTENCY OF PRODUCTS. CANNABIS PRODUCTS CONTINUES TO INCREASE OUR CHILDREN OUR GREATEST RISK. IF YOU LOOKED AT SOME OF THE STUDIES COMING OUT A COLORADO YOU SAW THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY THINK NOW THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE WAS WORKED HARDER ESPECIALLY ON EDIBLE. PRODUCTS FOR CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY HAD A VERY BIG PROBLEM ADAM. INITIALLY AND THEY'RE WORKING ON TIGHTENING THOSE REGULATIONS NOW. SO IF WE CAN WORK ON SAVING OUR CHILDREN A LITTLE MORE DISTILLED SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENTS SCHOOL TEACHER JUST CAN'T RESIST ASKING YOU TODAY. THEN S. B. FOURTEEN FIFTY ONE SEEKS TO PREVENT THE DISTRIBUTION OF CANNABIS TO MINORS. BY DETERRING RETAILERS FROM MAKING ILLEGAL UNDER AGE SALES AND ENSURES THAT COMPLIANCE EFFORTS ARE MAINTAINED.

FOR THEIR LICENSES THIS BILL WILL ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN ARE TRICKY ASTRONAUT VOTE MEMBERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS IS A AND JUST AS THE A CLARIFICATION THAT THAT ALSO GET ACCEPTING THE AMEND ITS ASSEMBLYMEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU LIKE -- ADDITIONAL -- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ON IS IS IT AND SO -- WILL ALLOW UP. TO TWO MINUTES FOR WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. AND WELCOME. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO ME READY. I'M SURE YOU REMEMBER ME FROM LAST WEEK. SUCH I MAKE IT PRETTY FAST I'M JACKI DOT WHO BEGAN AND I AM THE MOTHER OF ACTUALLY DONE HIM. AGAIN TO BOLIVIA BURKE WHO WAS KILLED IN THE BERKELEY BALCONY COLLAPSE ON JUNE SIXTEENTH -- TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AS A SAID BEFORE MCGEORGE OF OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD TO PASS LEGISLATION. BUT NOT HEARING CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL BILL FOR SIXTY FIVE IS WATERED DOWN. BECAUSE OF THE LOBBYISTS. AND THE REPORTING STRUCTURE WAS TAKEN OPTION AND IT WASN'T FOR STUDY. SO THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE BILL UP TO STUDY. BUT I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU GUYS IS HOW WOULD YOU. ARE ALL THE PEOPLE LIVING OF BALCONIES KNOW IF THEY WERE SAFE ARE JUST WAITING TO FALL DOWN. IF THE STUDENTS HAD I KNOWN THAT SAKE WE HAD ISSUES WITH BALCONIES ABID SUED REPEATEDLY OVER THE PAST DECADE BY CLAIMS OF SHODDY WORK AND PAID OUT OVER TWENTY SIX MILLION. IN THE TREE YEARS PART TO BERKELEY BALCONY CLAPPED BECAUSE OF WATER DAMAGE. DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THE STUDENTS WOULD BE ON THAT BALCONY. I DON'T THINK SO. WHAT THAT SEGUE BUILT WOULD YOU I WENT OUT ON THE BALCONY? WHY IS THE COMPANY ALLOWED TO SHODDY WORK AND THEN SECRETLY PAID TO COVER UP? WHY IS THE CONTRACTORS ARE DIFFERENT TO PHYSICIANS ENGINEERS ARCHITECTS? BUT OUR PROFESSIONALS ARE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY STATE LICENSING BOARD WHEN THEY SETTLE LAWSUITS. STEAMING FROM WORK RELATED ERRORS WHY SHOULD THE PUBLIC AND THE REGULATORS BE KEPT OUT OF THE LOOP ON THE CONTRACTOR SETTLEMENT RIGHT COURTS. S. B. ONE FOUR SIX FIVE IS MUCH NARROWER THAN SELF REPORTING AN INSURER REPORT LAWS. THAT I NEED OR LICENSEE TRADE AND PROFESSION. ITS REPORT REQUIREMENT IS JUST A MILLION DOLLARS AND APPLIES HOMEY TO MULTI FAMILY RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES SOME HOTELS COLLEGES. AND SINGLE FAMILY HOMES GUYS ARE NOT INCLUDE IT. SO REALLY. IT SADDENS ME THE PEOPLE OPPOSE THIS BECAUSE IT CAN PREVENT MAJOR IN JUST YEAR DEFT. AND DIS GROUP SHOULD WANT TO RESERVE REPRESENT A SAFE INDUSTRY AND STOP HIDING BEHIND BACK CONTRACTORS BY SUPPORTING THE CONTRACTORS LICENSE BOARD CAN GET RID OF UP BY DOCTORS. I'M BY ALLOWING SETTLEMENTS FROM INSURANCE ARE CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES TO BE FORWARD TO THE CONTRACTORS LICENSE BOARD SO THEY CAN PROTECT THE PUBLIC. BY A CONFIDENTIAL INVESTIGATION SUCH CONFIDENTIAL THAT'S ALL WE'RE ASKING. FOR WHAT YOU THINK IT WAS YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS. HOW WOULD YOU FEEL? MANY MANY MORE BALCONIES GOING TO FALL DOWN IN CALIFORNIA. I JUST MY LAST POINT REVIEW AS MY UNDERSTANDING IS. PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC IS REQUIRED TO BE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR THE CONTRACTORS LICENSING BOARDS. TO REALLY EXERCISE ITS LICENSING REGULATORY AND DISPLAY INJURY FUNCTIONS. HOW CAN THE CONTRACTORS LICENSING BOARD DO THEIR JOB A PROTECT THE PUBLIC IF THEY DO NOT HAVE THE TOOLS? RIGHT NOW THEY'VE RECEIVED ABOUT. FIFTEEN THOUSAND CONSUMER COMPLAINTS PER YEARS BUT THEY'RE ALL SINGLE FAMILY. THEY'RE NOT THE BIG MULTI. THEY DON'T GET MUCH RELATED TO MULTI DWELLINGS SINCE THEY'VE SETTLED OUT OF COURT ARE SUBTLE AND THE INSURANCE MAKE THE PAYMENTS. SO THE CONTEXT LINES WERE NEVER FIND OUT ABOUT IT LIKE IN SIDEWAYS CASE SO IS THE CONTRACTORS LICENSE BOARD ONLY DARE TO PROTECT SINGLE FAMILY -- RELATED CONSUMER COMPLAINTS. GUYS THIS IS A A REASON TO REFORM THE DESERVES TO BE MOVE FORWARD. TO AND TO REALLY PROTECT CALIFORNIANS AND THE VISITORS I'M SPEAKING OUT TODAY IN HONOR OF THE STUDENTS HERE. AT THE PICTURES LOOK AT THEM FRONT TO ME -- WHO NO LONGER HAVE A VOICE? I URGE YOU GUYS TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND DON'T LET THEIR DEATHS BE IN VAIN. ITS MY QUEST TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE TO PREVENT SUCH A MEDIA STRATEGY FROM REOCCURRING BECAUSE BECAUSE OF ELSE HAD DONE THE RIGHT THING. AND THERE'S NO SECRET SETTLEMENTS PAID OUT BY SEGWAY IN CHURNS AND THE CONSTRUCTION BOARD HADN'T KNOWN ABOUT THIS. PEACE KIDS COULD HAVE BEEN ALIVE TODAY. THEY COULD BE TODAY HAVE MUCH. HOW DIFFERENT REPORT TO DO SO THE CONTRACTOR'S LICENSE IMPORTS BECAUSE STATEWIDE HAD PAID OUT SO MANY MILLIONS THREE YEARS PRIOR [inaudible] SO [inaudible] WE NO AND DO THE RIGHT TO AND I'M VOTE YES ON THIS BILL. IF THE PARENTS I DON'T CONCERNED ABOUT. THE BUILDER LOBBYISTS CARE ABOUT MY DAUGHTER MY KNEES AT THE FOUR FRIENDS WHO DIED BUT BURKE YOU DON'T NEED TO UPS. AND THE SEVEN WHO WERE SERIOUSLY INJURED. BUT FAIR ABOUT THE PUBLIC THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TODAY. AND YOU THE LAWMAKERS SHOULD. TO SO I'M REALLY ASKING YOU HEAR ME TODAY HOW MY PUNK YOU KNOW TIME. COULD YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US HERE TODAY AND A DISH NO WITNESSES SO WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT SEE NO DISH NO WITNESSES AND SUPPORT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. EPIDIDYMIS DE ANY ADDITIONAL IF YOU COULD CUT GET KIND THE US SUBMARINES APOLOGIES -- CHAIR MEMBERS MIKE AND THAT HE FOR THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- ONE OF OUR CORE MISSION THIS REMOVAL OF BAD ACTORS FROM THE INDUSTRY WHEN NECESSARY AND WE BELIEVE THAT CSV EFFECTIVENESS IN HAND FROM THE PUBLIC IS ABLE TO REPORT POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF THE CONTRACTORS LAW. TO THE CONTRACTORS BOARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST HOT BLOOM STEIN FOR THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION IN RELUCTANT OPPOSITION TO BE VERY BRIEF. OUR OPPOSITION IS IS THIS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE WE DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE THAT -- CIVIL SETTLEMENTS ARE INDICATORS OF FAULTY WORK IT'S NOT NECESSARILY AN INDICATION OF FAULTY WORK. AND TO ILLUSTRATE THAT POINT TO THE THE BURDEN OF PROOF STANDARDS ARE DIFFERENT FOR CS OB DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS. THE STANDARD IS CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE OF FOR CIVIL ACTIONS IT'S A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE THERE'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT. DID DIFFERENT STANDARDS THAT ARE RECESS WE DON'T THINK THE INFORMATION TO THE BOARD IS GONNA NECESSARILY INDICATE FAULTY WORKING FINALLY. OF THE CIVIL SETTLEMENTS ARE NOT MADE BY CONTRACTORS THEY'RE MADE BY THE INSURANCE CARRIERS ALSO BASED ON THOSE TWO REASONS WE DO OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME.

LIKE PEOPLE DO WHEN THEY GO ON YELP THESE DAYS THEY WANT TO GATHER AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE. WHETHER OR NOT THEY HIRE THIS CONTRACTOR I THINK IT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF DISCLOSURE.
