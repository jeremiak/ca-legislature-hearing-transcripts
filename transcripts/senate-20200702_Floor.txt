SIZE TWENTY SEVEN KNOWS EIGHT THE LETTER WILL BE SUBMITTED TO THE JOURNAL MEMBERS WE ARE MOVING ON TO CONSIDERATION OF THE DAILY FILE SENATE THIRD READING ITEM SIXTEEN SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON ARE YOU READY I AM VERY GOOD MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE BY SENATOR JACKSON AN ACT RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT CENTER JACKSON GOOD MORNING MADAM PRESIDENT CALLING SO I JUST GOT A TEXT FROM MY HUSBAND WHO TOLD ME THAT. HE AND MY TWO GRANDCHILDREN ARE WATCHING RIGHT NOW SO I SHOULD FEEL NO PRESSURE WHATSOEVER- SO- WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO START AND WE SURE EVERYBODY- THE TOP OF THE MORNING. I AM HONORED TODAY. TO PRESENT THE SB. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE. THE FAMILY LEAVE BUDGET BILL. THIS IS PART OF THE BUDGET AGREEMENT REACHED BY THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP. THIS IS AN AREA WHERE I HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS DURING MY TENURE HERE IN THE SENATE SO I AM PARTICULARLY PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT THIS HERE TODAY. BECAUSE IF THERE IS ONE PREDICTABLE EXPERIENCE IN LIFE IT IS THAT WE WILL AT SOME POINT NEED TO CARE FOR OUR LOVED ONES OR BE THERE TO HELP. THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF A NEWBORN'S LIFE. DEAL WITH PARENTS WHO ARE ILL. OR HAVE OUR CHILDREN CARE FOR US AS WE AGE. AND SO THIS BILL STRENGTHENS THE IMPORTANT LAW KNOWN AS THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHT CHECKED WHICH PROVIDES THE JOB PROTECTION FOUNDATION FOR OUR STATE PAID FAMILY LEAVE WAGE REPLACEMENT PROGRAM. SO WHAT IS THIS WE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE IRST IN THE NATION TO CREATE A PROGRAM BY WHICH PEOPLE COULD. TAKE LEAVE THAT WOULD BE PAID FOR. THE PROGRAM REQUIRES THE EMPLOYEE. TO PUT MONEY IN TO THAT PROGRAM NOT THE EMPLOYER SO WHEN YOU TAKE FAMILY LEAVE YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY CALLING IN THE SAVINGS ACCOUNT THAT YOU HAVE CREATED. WE HAVE NOW IN CALIFORNIA'S SIX WEEKS OF PARTIALLY PUT PAID WAY REPLACEMENT IT WILL BE GOING UP TO EIGHT WEEKS IN JANUARY. WELL THAT'S GREAT BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT FOR TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS. CAN TAKE THAT LEAVE THAT THEY HAVE AND GET REIMBURSED BOARD. GET PAID OUT OF THEIR OWN SAVINGS ACCOUNT A PARTIAL WAGE REPLACEMENT. BUT THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THEIR JOB WILL BE THERE WHEN THEY RETURN. WHAT THIS BILL IS TODAY IS THE OTHER HALF OF THAT EQUATION. THE HALF OF THAT EQUATION THAT ASSURES PEOPLE WHEN THEY TAKE THE LEAD THEY ARE ENTITLED TO TAKE. THEIR JOB WILL BE THERE WHEN THEY COME BACK. BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS PEOPLE DON'T TAKE THE LEAVE BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THEY'RE GONNA LOSE THEIR JOB. THAT IS A HOBSON'S CHOICE A SOPHIE'S CHOICE. EITHER YOU TAKE BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE ENTITLED TO. OR YOU LOSE YOUR JOB BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE THAT. THAT IS WRONG. THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT IF NOT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO BE PAYMENT BEINGS. TO HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO CARE FOR A SICK FAMILY MEMBER OR THEIR OWN HEALTH. OR HAVE A JOB WHEN THEY'RE DONE. THAT'S JUST A CRUEL AND INHUMAN. APPROACH TO PEOPLE HAVING NEEDS TO CARE FOR FAMILY BECAUSE WE ARE ALL HUMAN BEINGS AND I WILL POSH AT THAT. THOSE OF US WHO HAVE NOT YET HAD THAT RESPONSIBILITY WILL AT SOME POINT HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY. TO CARE FOR THEMSELVES. IF THEY BECOME ILL OR TO CARE FOR A LOVED ONE OR TO HAVE A FAMILY. AND BE ABLE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN TO BE THERE DURING THOSE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT EARLY TIMES WHICH WE KNOW BY THE WAY. ARE BENEFICIAL NOT ONLY TO THE INFANT BUT ALSO TO THE MOTHER REDUCES POST PARTUM DEPRESSION BY A THIRD. IT ALSO CREATES A LIFETIME BOND WITH A NEW FATHER. NOW 25% OF THE PEOPLE TODAY. WHO HAVE NEW CHECK A FAMILIES CAN'T ACCESS THAT LEAVE. THIS BILL WILL CORRECT THAT IT'S SIX TO CLOSE THE CARE GIVING GAP THAT HIS EXISTED FOR FAR TOO LONG CREATING AN UNCONSCIONABLE DIVIDE BETWEEN THOSE WHO CAN TAKE THE TIME OFF BECAUSE THEY WORK FOR AN EMPLOYER OF A HIGHER NUMBER AND THOSE WHO CAN'T SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WORK FOR AN EMPLOYER OF A LESSER. NUMBER THERE IS NO CONNECTION BETWEEN THE NEED TO CARE FOR FAMILY AND THE EMPLOYER THAT YOU WORK FOR. WHY SHOULD THERE-BE THAT DISTINCTION THERE SHOULD NOT. AND I BELIEVE IT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TO CLOSE THAT GAP DURING THIS PANDEMIC. AFTER ALL WE WANT THOSE TO STAY HOME SO THEY DON'T INFECT OTHERS. WE NEED FAMILY CARE GIVING TO HELP PEOPLE- TO HELP PREVENT HOSPITALIZATIONS AND GOD FOR BID NURSING HOME PLACEMENTS NURSING HOMES THE DEATH TOTAL OF ALL OUR CODE PATIENTS AS A RESULT OF NURSING HOME INFECTION IS 43% OF ALL CODED RELATED DEATHS TO THIS DATE. ART NURSING HOMES. PEOPLE ABILITY CARE FOR THEIR LOVED ONES IT REDUCES NURSING HOME NEEDS BY 11% RIGHT OFF THE BAT. NOW THE UNITED STATES. THE SHAMEFULLY THE ONLY INDUSTRIALIZED AND WEALTHY NATION IN THE WORLD. WITHOUT A NATIONAL PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM. STATE INSTEAD HAVE BEEN FORCED TO FILL THE VOID AND AS I MENTIONED SIXTEEN YEARS AGO CALIFORNIA ENACTED WHAT WAS THEN THE FIRST PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM AGAIN ENTIRELY WORKER FUNDED. THE EMPLOYEE DOES NOT PAY A DIME INTO THEIR PROGRAM. BUT FROM THE BEGINNING AS I MENTIONED FOR TWO WORKERS WERE EXCLUDED FROM THOSE PROTECTIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE BASED ON THE SIZE OF THE EMPLOYER JOB PROTECTED TIME UNDER A FAMILY RIGHT CHECK FOR CARE GIVING AND TAKING OFF FOR ONE'S OWN ILLNESS EXCLUDES UP TO FORTY FORTY FOUR ZERO PERCENT. OF THE WORKFORCE. AND THIS HAS FORCED THEIR TERRIBLE CHOICE. RESEARCH TELLS US THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE TAKEN FOR FAMILY CARE GIVING DECREASES HOSPITALIZATIONS MEDICAL COSTS AND OF COURSE THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE YOU'RE ABLE TO STAY HOME AND TAKE CARE YOURSELF OR TAKE YOUR YOUR LOVED ONES. SO THAT THE ILLNESS OF THE DISEASE OR WHATEVER IT IS DOESN'T GET WORSE RESULTING IN THOSE HOSPITALIZATIONS AND MEDICAL COSTS RESEARCH TELLS US THAT BIG BABY BONDING AS I MENTIONED THE CREASES POST PARTUM DEPRESSION AND THE OTHER ITEMS THAT I MENTIONED. NOW WITH RESEARCH LIKE THIS WE SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN DO TO REMOVE THE BARRIERS TO THIS FAMILY LEAVE. THAT'S WHAT SB EIGHT AT THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE DOES IT STRENGTHENS THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHT CHECK AND GUARANTEES TWELVE WEEKS OF UNPAID JOB PROTECTED LEAVE TO CARE FOR A NEWBORN. A SERIOUSLY ILL FAMILY MEMBER OR ONE'S OWN ILLNESS FOR THOSE WHO WORK FOR EMPLOYEES OF FIVE EMPLOYEES OR MORE. IT PROVIDES JOB PROTECTED BENEFITS THEN FOR NINETY TWO PERCENT. OF CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE. THIS BILL A LARGE DEAF OF FAMILY WITHIN THE FAMILY RIGHT TO ACT AND THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM. TO ALLOW FOR CARE FOR GRANDPARENTS. GRAND CHILDREN ADULT CHILDREN IN LAWS AND SIBLINGS. CALIFORNIA IS THE SECOND MOST MULTI GENERATIONAL STATE IN THE COUNTRY. WE CARE FOR OUR LOVED ONES IN MANY INSTANCES WE LIVE WITH OUR GRANDPARENTS FOR OUR GRANDCHILDREN OR IN LAWS OR WE ARE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES FOR THEIR HEALTH AND WELL BEING BECAUSE THERE IS NOBODY ELSE. THIS BILL ALSO CONNECTS A ONE MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATION IN THE BUDGET. CREATING A PROGRAM TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR BOWL OF SMALL BUSINESSES WHOSE EMPLOYEES TAKE THIS LEAVE. AND THE BILL WAS RECENTLY AMENDED TO EXEMPT VERY SMALL BUSINESSES OF FOR EMPLOYEES OR LESS FROM THESE REQUIREMENTS WE ALSO DIFFER IMPLEMENTATION TO JANUARY. WHICH IS PART OF THE ISSUE HERE IT'S NOW DEFERRED. IT'S STILL THE RECALL THAT AN EMPLOYEE HAS WORKED FOR AN EMPLOYER FOR ONE YEAR AND AT LEAST TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOURS IN ORDER TO. BE ABLE TO APPLY AND THE QUALIFY. NOW SIGNIFICANT DELIBERATIONS HAVE GONE INTO THIS PROPOSAL THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN- PERFORMED THERE'S A STUDY RECENTLY FROM STANFORD A STUDY FROM THE BUDGET- GROUPS. THAT ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR CAREFUL PRECISE OBJECTIVE WORK IN THESE AREAS. IT IS THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION PUT FORWARD BY THE GOVERNOR'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE TASK FORCE WHICH WAS A STAKEHOLDER GROUP DRIVEN BY RESEARCH THAT MEN FROM MATT FOR MONTHS. AND INCLUDED BUSINESS LABOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION QUIRK AND FAMILY ADVOCATES AND OTHERS. NOW. I KNOW THERE'S OPPOSITION TO THIS ARM I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE POINTS THAT ARE- PRESENTED ARE VALID- BUT CERTAINLY I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE WE WILL HEAR THEM TODAY AND- I WOULD JUST LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THE CONCERNS- THE OPPOSITION IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN MUCH TO THINK OF THIS IS SOME EXTREME PROGRAM THEY'RE ALREADY FIVE STATES IN THE COUNTRY TO GO DOWN TO ZERO. YEAH SHE- PROVIDING ENJOY PROTECTION FOR THEM WE HAVE HAD A THE STATE. WE'VE HAD IN THE STATE XIN XIN SEVENTY EIGHT. ARE PREGNANT SHE DISABILITY LEAVE FOR COMPANIES OF FIVE OR MORE THAT'S FORTY TWO YEARS THIS PROGRAM HAS WORKED. THIS ROGRAM HAS NOT RESULTED IN PROFLIGATE LIT LITIGATION. OUR THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT FAMILIES IN THIS COUNTRY. AND IN THE STATE ARE DESPERATELY IN NEED OFF BECAUSE A GOOD EMPLOYEE ONE WHO IS GIVEN RESPECT AND THE KNOWLEDGE TO HAVE A LIFE OUTSIDE OF WORK IS A BETTER EMPLOYEE THE DATA ALL SHOWS IT AND OF COURSE WHEN YOU RETAIN EMPLOYEES YOU SAVE MONEY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO RETAINING YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO OUT AND SEEK NEW EMPLOYEES. I MEAN THIS IS A WIN WIN FOR BOTH SIDES IT IS DEFINITELY A CULTURE CHANGE AND I APPRECIATE THAT. BUT THE FACT IS WE HAVE SEEN. PORTIONS OF THAT OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST FORTY TWO YEARS WE HAVE SEEN WHEN WE DID THE NEW PARENT LEAVE ACT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THE BENEFITS FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN. AND DO SIMPLY EXTENDS THOSE BENEFITS RECOGNIZING OUR COMMON HUMANITY AND THE NEED THAT WE HAVE TO BE THERE FOR OUR LOVED ONES TO TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN HEALTH. AND TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE REARING OF OUR FAMILIES AND OUR CHILDREN. AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FEAR I FELT. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON. MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I WANT TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA FOR REALLY- WELL PRESENTED BACKGROUND ON THIS BILL AND ALSO FOR HER LONG LONG WORK ON THIS AND COMMITMENT TO THIS ISSUE. WHEN I WHAT HAD MY DAUGHTER. IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES THERE WAS NO PAID FAMILY LEAVE. SO I TOOK MY TWO WEEKS OF SICK LEAVE I WORKED TILL JUST. COUPLE DAYS BEFORE SHE WAS BORN. I THEN WENT BACK TO WORK SO I THINK I HAD TWO WEEKS TO SICK LEAVE IT SO I WENT BACK TO WORK WHEN SHE WAS. JUST UNDER TWO WEEKS OLD. MAYBE JUST AT TWO WEEKS I BROUGHT HER TO WORK. NOBODY'S THAT'S NOT SOMETHING MOST PEOPLE CAN DO. HOW I HAD A JOB THAT ALLOWED ME TO DO IT IS QUITE REMARKABLE AND I WAS QUITE FORTUNATE WITHOUT THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE. WE KNOW THAT SO MANY FAMILIES FACE THIS I DID NOT HAVE TO FACE TAKING CARE OF EITHER OF MY PARENTS BECAUSE MOST UNFORTUNATELY TEY DIED. QUITE A LONG TIME AGO. BUT IF I NEEDED TO NOW AND IF WE HAD NO PAID FAMILY LEAVE. WHAT SITUATION WOULD I BE IT FOR ANY OF US. AND AS OUR COLLEAGUE POINTED OUT. AS THE EMPLOYEE WE ARE PAYING INTO THE SYSTEM WE HAVE ALREADY MADE A DEPOSIT INTO IT AND WHAT THIS REALLY DES AS SHE'S SO WELL DESCRIBED IS GUARANTEE THAT WE CAN HAVE A JOB WHEN WE RETURN SO IN MY SITUATION I COULD HAVE. TAKEN A LITTLE MORE TIME BOTH TO RECOVER FROM THE BIRTH ENTER OF TAKING CARE OF MY DAUGHTER AND- THEN I COULD HAVE RETURNED TO WORK KNOWING THAT MY JOB WAS THERE INSTEAD OF TAKING A TWO WEEK OLD TO A JOB EVERY DAY WHICH I WILL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW. WAS INSANITY. SO THIS IS A VERY NEEDED POLICY. AND AS THE DEBATE ON THE FLOOR- WHEN WE LAST TOOK THIS UP. TALKED ABOUT. WE ARE REALLY THE ONLY- E. C. D. COUNTRIES. THE DOES NOT HAVE SUCH A POLICY. UNITED STATES THE ONLY. AND UNFORTUNATELY WHILE THIS AFFECTS EVERYONE MEN WOMEN ANY GENDER. WHAT IS IT THE LACK OF THIS POLICY HAS MOST IMPACTED WOMEN'S ABILITY TO MOVE UP ECONOMICALLY AND TO MOVE IN THE WORK FORCE. AND THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS POINT SO I REALLY STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE BY VIRGIN AYE VOTE AND I THINK THE GOOD SENATOR FOR FROM SANTA BARBARA AND I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR INSISTING TO MOVE THIS FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER GET CENTER WIENER. BUT YOU VERY MUCH MADAM IRA AND SUPPORT OF- US SENATE BILL THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE AND I ALSO WANT TO RELEASE MY DEEP CREDIT. TO THE CENTER OF THE SANTA BARBARA FOR HER DOG AND PURSUE OF A RATIONAL. AND WORKABLE AND JOSS PAID FAMILY LEAVE APPROACH INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DATA AND THIS. OF PAID FAMILY AND FOUNDER POLICY AROUND WORLD. IT IS DEEPLY MORTIFYING THAT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS SO FAR BEHIND OTHER NATIONS IN MOST PARTS OF THE WORLD IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD THIS IS NOT CONTROVERSIAL. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WHERE WE HAVE TO HAVE A FIGHT EVERY TIME YOU TRY TO IMPLEMENT. FAMILY LEAVE IT'S CONSIDERED AS BASIC AS NORMAL THAT OF COURSE WHEN SOMEONE HAS A NEW CHILD OR HAS A SIX SPOUSE AT HOME OR HAS A SICK CHILD OF COURSE. YOU CAN STAY HOME AND TAKE CARE OF THAT PERSON. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FRANKLY OF A SAFETY NET IN GENERAL AND FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE TO BE THERE FOR OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS WHETHER IT'S A NEW CHILD OR SICK FAMILY MEMBERS AND THE IDEA THAT WE CONTINUE. TO FORCE. SOMETHING LIKE FORTY PERCENT.OF CALIFORNIA WORKERS TO THE SIDE ARE YOU GOING TO CARE FOR YOUR NEW CHILD. OR YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A JOB. ARE YOU GOING TO CARE FOR YOUR SICK PARENT OR YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A JOB. AND THAT'S THE CHOICE THAT WE ARE FORCING. ON MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA WORKERS EVERY SINGLE DAY AND LET'S BE CRYSTAL CLEAR ABOUT WHO THOSE WORKERS ARE. IT'S NOT EQUALLY SPREAD AMONG ALL WORKERS THIS IS DISPROPORTIONATELY DRAMATICALLY HARMING. LOW INCOME WORKERS SERVICE WORKERS LOWER PAID WOMEN. WHO ARE OFTEN THE ONES WHO ARE FORCED INTO THAT TERRIBLE CHOICE. AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THIS IS NOT EQUALLY SPREAD. AND WHAT WE ARE ASKING IS TO HAVE MORE EQUITY SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THAT TERRIBLE CHOICE AND COVERT OF COURSE HAS AS IT IS DONE IN MANY. ASPECTS OF SOCIETY HAS CAST A HUGE SPOTLIGHT ON THIS TERRIBLE INEQUITY WHERE PEOPLE AGAIN ARE BEING FORCED TO CHOOSE DO I TAKE CARE OF MY FAMILY MEMBER. OR DO I HAVE A JOB. WHEN I WAS A MEMBER OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WE WERE ABLE TO PASS EXPANDED PAID PARENTAL LEAVE. LEGISLATION AND I WILL TELL YOU COLLEAGUES THE NUMBER OF WORKERS IN THE YEARS SINCE THEN WHO HAVE COME UP TO ME ON THE STREET OR AT A RESTAURANT OR ELSEWHERE. AND THANKED ME ANDMY COLLEAGUES FROM THE BOTTOM OF THEIR HEART. BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE DONE OTHERWISE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING WITH THESE TERRIBLE DECISIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY DECISIONS. TODAY'S LEGISLATION SP THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE WILL HELP ELIMINATE THAT TERRIBLE. FOR CALLING THIS IS YOU KNOW I IT THESE ISSUES AND THIS LEASE OR ALWAYS. BUT WHEN YOU. AT THE BASIC ISSUE THIS IS A BASIC MORAL DECISION. TO SHOULD THE UNITED STATES FOR CALIFORNIA. BE DOING WHAT SO MUCH OF THE REST OF THE WORLD IS DOING TO TREAT THESE WORKERS TO TREAT THESE FAMILIES FAIRLY. AND TO. AND TO THAT TERRIBLE CHOICE BETWEEN CARING FOR A FAMILY MEMBER. AND HAVING A JOB I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER CENTERED. THANK YOU A- MADAM PRESIDENT. I'M GONNA HAVE A LITTLE BIT FOR DIFFERENT TO TAKE ON THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION I THINK THEN MAYBE A LOT OF OTHERS ON THE FLOOR BUT- I WANT TO SHARE A- THIS IS THE AUTHOR THIS BILL. BROUGHT A BILL A FEW YEARS BACK SB SIXTY THREE. AND I WAS ONE OF THE- THREE REPUBLICANS IN THE ASSEMBLY THAT SUPPORTED THAT BILL I THINK THAT THERE IT WAS A RIGHTEOUS BILL AND IT WAS ALSO IN THE SAME AREA BUT I WANT TO SHARE WITH THE MEMBERS AND LEGISLATORS OF THIS BODY. I'VE BEEN IN THIS LEGISLATOR FOR A IN THIS LEGISLATURE FOR EIGHT YEARS. AND IN THIS EIGHT YEARS. I CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE I'M A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER AND WE REALLY AREN'T REPRESENTED. HERE WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE SMALL BUSINESSES DON'T REALLY HAVE A PACK AND THEY'RE THEY'RE BUSY RUNNING THEIR BUSINESSES AND THE LIGHTS AND I DON'T HAVE MORE THAN FIVE EMPLOYEES I THE MOST I'VE EVER HAD IS FOR- SO THIS BILL IS A GOOD IN FACT AFFECT MY BUSINESS BUT IT'S GONNA FACT. FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION I COULD GATHER. AND THERE'S BEEN TALK ABOUT THE COST THERE IS NO COST WELL THERE IS A COST TO THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. ACOSTA TRAINING. SOMEBODY TO REPLACE THEM YOU CAN TAKE THIS LEAVE AN- HOUR INCREMENTS. IF YOU HAVE A BUSINESS WITH FIVE EMPLOYEES AND ONE EMPLOYEE IS THE OPERATOR OR A MAIN POSITION IN YOUR COMPANY THAT. YOU CAN'T REPLACE THAT MAKES THE OTHER FOR POSITIONS WORK. AND THEY'RE GONE FOR A LONG TIME IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT. AND YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE HEARD ABOUT YOU ABOUT A LOT TO BE THERE THERE'S NOT BEEN ONE PIECE THE STATION I CAN RECALL EIGHT YEARS THAT I'VE HERE THAT ACTUALLY HELP MY BUSINESS. WE'VE HAD MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE AND WE'RE GOING TO YEAH WE'RE GOING TO DO YOU A FAVOR WE'RE GOING TO. PHASE IT IN OVERTIME. WE USED TO HAVE AN EXEMPTION FOR AG THAT WE WERE ABLE TO. NOT HAVE TO PAY OVERTIME UP TO SIXTY HOURS. AND IT WAS FOR WHEN WE HARVESTED. AND WE PLANTED. THAT THAT'S BEEN TAKEN AWAY. AB FIVE YOU CAN'T EVEN NOW CONTRACT WITH SOMEBODY TO REPLACE THIS EMPLOYEE IT'S GOING TO TAKE THIS TIME OUT BECAUSE IT AB FIVE AND IN MY BUSINESS WHERE WE HAVE A WE HAVE A TRUCKING BUSINESS IF MY PLAYERS YOU LEAVE AS I MENTIONED THE OTHER NIGHT WHEN WE WERE HERE. TILL MIDNIGHT TAKING. THE TESTIMONY ON THE BUDGET. THAT'S A POSITION THAT HAS. A SPECIAL LICENSE IS IN A DRUG PROGRAM. HAS HOURS OF SERVICE MANY QUALIFICATIONS FOR THAT THERE ARE MILLION SHORT IN THIS STATE FOR TRUCK DRIVERS SO TO REPLACE A TRUCK DRIVER UNDER THIS LAW WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT. AND IN AND A TIME WHEN WE'VE SEEN BUSINESSES LAY OFF SHUT DOWN BECAUSE OF CODE BUT I THINK THIS IS ANOTHER HIT. TO BUSINESSES. YOU KNOW I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT THE LEGISLATURE. PASSES ALL KINDS OF LAWS TO REGULATE MY BUSINESS AND THEY DON'T EVEN ABIDE BY THE LAWS. THE DAY PASS. THIS LEGISLATURE RIGHT HERE DID NOT PAY OVERTIME TO THE EMPLOYEES THAT WERE HERE TILL MIDNIGHT THE OTHER NIGHT. WHY IS THAT WHY DON'T WE DO IT LEASE ABIDE BY THE SAME LAWS. BUT EVERYBODY ELSE HAS TO WE ARE RIGHT WE HAD A BILL IN THE ASSEMBLY THIS SAID THAT A YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATOR SAID NO WE'RE SPECIAL. WELL I PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR AMERICANS I THINK THAT'S KIND OF SPECIAL TO. I WANT TO ASK YOU ALL OF YOU ON YOUR DESK. HAVE A BOTTLE. I BELIEVE A LITTLE BROWN BOTTLE. NOW IN MY BUSINESS I'M REGULATED BY PROPOSITION SIXTY FIVE. WHAT'S IN THIS BOTTLE DO YOU KNOW CAN ANYBODY TELL ME WHAT IS IN THIS BOTTLE. THERE'S NO LABEL ON IT. THIS IN MY BUSINESS WOULD BE CONSIDERED SOMETHING I COULD GET SUED OVER BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THIS BOTTLE. THERE'S NO LABEL ON. BUT WE DON'T ABIDE BY THOSE RULES WHAT ABOUT EMPLOYEES IN THIS HOUSE THE DON'T HAVE TO ABIDE BY THE SAME RULES YOU KNOW IT'S JUST VERY FRUSTRATING AS A LEGISLATOR TO HAVE TO HEAR. HOW BAD WE ARE AS EMPLOYERS TO EMPLOYEES WE DON'T NEED THE GOVERNMENT TO GET IN THE WAY OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR EMPLOYEES. MY WIFE MEGAN WAS PREGNANT AND WORKING AT THE TIME WE HAD OUR FIRST CHILD AND SHE WORKED FOR A COMPANY. THERE WAS NO PROBLEMS YEAH ALL THE TIMES NEEDED OFF AND ACTUALLY PATER. WE ONE OF OUR EMPLOYEES WE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM WE DON'T NEED THE BURDENSOME REGULATIONS OF GOVERNMENT TO TELL US HOW TO. WORK WITH OUR EMPLOYEES AND WHAT IS JUST AND RIGHT. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET GOOD EMPLOYEES SO WHEN YOU GET THEM YOU WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. MEMBERS I AM VERY FRUSTRATED FOR THE FACT THAT I CAME HERE TO TRY TO SPEAK. FOR THOSE WHO DON'T. HAVE A LOBBY IN AN ART ORGANIZED AND THAT'S THE SMALL BUSINESSES OF CALIFORNIA. AND I HEARD YOU TO THINK ABOUT. THE BURDEN IS GOING TO PUT ON THE BUSINESSES TO CROSS TRAIN IT TO FIND THOSE. AT A TIME WHEN WE'VE SEEN MASSIVE LAYOFFS. I URGE NO VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY CENTER GROVE. AS IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL AS WELL BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR SHE COULD POSSIBLY ANSWER IT THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL. SENATE JACKSON ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE OF A QUESTION I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE IT AND RESPOND TO IT IN MY CLOTHES. AND MY QUESTION IS THAT IS IN THE LANGUAGE IT'S NOT CONSECUTIVE. SO IT'S NOT TWELVE WEEKS CONSECUTIVE. THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL SAYS IT'S NOT CONSECUTIVE. CONSECUTIVE MEANING TWELVE WEEKS SO SOMEONE HAS A BABY LIKE YOU EXPLAINED THE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF LEVEL ONE. THIS IS NOT TWELVE WEEKS CONSECUTIVE. I REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE TO BE THERE YEAR TWELVE HUNDRED FIFTY HOURS WHICH IS BASICALLY TWENTY FOUR HOURS A WEEK FOR FIFTY TWO WEEKS. THE TIME I. CONSECUTIVE SO. A FORTY. SEND TO TAKE. AS ACTUALLY TWENTY FOUR WEEKS AT TWENTY HOURS A DAY OUR TWENTY HOURS A WEEK. OR YOU COULD TAKE OFF EVERY FRIDAY FOR FIFTY TWO WEEKS OR YOU COULD TAKE US. AND YOU KNOW INTERMITTENT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT- CONSECUTIVE. SO FOLLOWING UP ON THAT'S MY QUESTION TO CONFIRM THAT IT'S NOT CONSECUTIVE CANCELING WHICH IS A STATE OUT AND THEN THE FOLLOW UP ON MY OWN TIME WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM BEAVER. THE BUSINESS OWNER I TO KEEP MY PEER THINKING THAT. IF I JUST DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WERE DOING WITH BUSINESS WHEN YOU PASSED ALL THESE RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT STOPPED US FROM PLAIN PEOPLE AND MAKING PEOPLE GAINFULLY EMPLOYED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. WHEN I GOT HERE IT ONLY TOOK ME ABOUT THIRTY DAYS TO FIGURE OUT THAT YOU DO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO SMALL BUSINESS AND TO BUSINESS OWNERS AND JOB CREATORS AND THE STATE. AND YOU JUST FRANKLY DON'T CARE- IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER SAYS TO BE A BUSINESS CENTER IN THIS STATE AND TRY TO PROVIDE GAINFULLY EMPLOYED PETE. SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. AND THEN HAVE REGULATORY PROCESS AFTER REGULATORY PROCESS INCREASES IN MINIMUM WAGE YOU MENTIONED THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND ALSO HIGH AFTER THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES BECAUSE ABOUT 60% OF THE FATALITIES IN MY DISTRICT THAT AFFECT. US BEING OPEN IN MY COMMUNITY ARE FROM STATE STATE REGULATED AND STATE LICENSED THAT ELDERLY CARE FACILITY SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. AND THEY NEED TO BE TAKEN CARE OF AND GIVEN A QUALITY LIFE ESPECIALLY AT THE TIME OF LIFE IF THEY'RE IN. IT WHEN YOU LOOK AT. THAT THAT PARTICULAR STATEMENT THAT YOU MADE ABOUT CARING FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE. AND IN THIS WOULD THAT WE NEED TO MAKE THE ELDER OR TO CARE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT A PARENT BONDS WITH THE CHILD. BUT WE ALSO MAKES IS. PROVIDE COME FROM BUSINESS. NO YOU GUYS THAT'S HOW. THE FACT. THE BUSINESS OR PRIVATE BIZ OR REQUIRE PERMITS PRIVATE BIZ ARE YOU TAX PRIVATE BUSINESS ANY AND AT THE THAT THEY EMPLOY AND THEN DOES EMPLOYEES GO OUT BY PRODUCT WHICH PAY TAXES ON SO IT'S ALL GENERATED FROM PRIVATE BUSINESS INTO TO DETRIMENTALLY HARM PRIVATE BUSINESS ESPECIALLY SMALL BUSINESS AND NOT HAVE. A LANGUAGE IN THERE TO WEAR NOT EVERY EMPLOYEE THERE WILL BE EMPLOYEES THAT WILL TAKE THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND HAVE A BABY BE GONE TWELVE WEEKS BE GRATEFUL FOR THOSE TWELVE WEEKS AND COME BACK. THERE WILL BE PEOPLE THAT HAVE A GRANDMOTHER WHO WAS ILL- LIKE MY GRANDDAUGHTER IS TAKING HER AND HEARD AT MY DAUGHTER IS TAKING HER HUSBAND'S GRANDMOTHER BACK AND FORTH TO LOS ANGELES AND SHE'S TAKING TIME OFF BECAUSE HER EMPLOYER ALLOWED HER THE TIME OFF NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE MANDATED NOT BECAUSE IT WAS THE LAW IT'S BECAUSE EMPLOYERS REALLY CARE ABOUT THEIR EMPLOYEES AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY CAN TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. SO SHE'S TAKING CARE OF GOING BACK FOR TO LA FOR CANCER TREATMENTS AND SHE'S ALLOWED TO TAKE THE TIME OFF AND OUR JOB IS THERE WHEN SHE GETS BACK SHE'S A NURSE SHE REALLY NEEDS TO BE COMING BACK TO WORK TO TAKE CARE OF THE SCHOOL WOULD SITUATION. BUT GOING BACK TO MY COLLEAGUE AT BIEBER ABOUT THE WAY THAT BUSINESSES PUNITIVE KIND AND THEN THE EXPRESSIONS FOR LABOR THAT COME ALONG- THE EXCEPTIONS FOR THIS BUILDING- MY COLLEAGUES SAYS YOU KNOW WHY AREN'T WAYS THIS BUILDING AND WHAT. BRINGS IT IN SEVENTY THINGS THIS THING DOESN'T THE CELLS IN THE LABOR LAWS THAT ARE PASSED IN THIS THING BECAUSE THIS BUILDING. FOR COMPLY. WITH WHAT ON. IN THE REAL WORLD IN THE BUSINESS WORLD. AND THAT'S EVIDENT. WHEN THE SENATE PRO TEMPORE TOGETHER WITH THE WORKPLACE CONDUCT UNIT. IN HAD. A JUST A STRUGGLE SHE WORKS SO HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT WOMEN IN THIS BUILDING AND PEOPLE IN THIS BUILDING HAD OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE A PLACE. I'M TO GO TO IN THERE WOULD NOT BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST RETALIATED AGAINST OR FIRED. AND LONG BEFORE SHE WORKED HARD TO MAKE THAT EQUAL WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. PEOPLE WOULD JUST GET FIRED IN THIS BUILDING FOR FILING A COMPLAINT AGAINST THEIR LEGISLATOR ALMIGHTY LEGISLATOR EMPLOYER. FIRE OR REPLACED OR MOVE TO A DIFFERENT OFFICE IN THE REAL WORLD THAT WAS ILLEGAL AND NOW THE SENATE PROTEIN JUST RECENTLY IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. HAS THANKS TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM AT LAKE ELSINORE THE PAST A PIECE OF LEGISLATION AFTER TRYING TO GET THROUGH THIS BUILDING FOR FIVE YEARS. THE SENATE PROTEIN WAS ABLE TO PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER THAT PROTECTED EMPLOYEES. SO THE REASON WHY THIS BUILDING DOESN'T OPERATE LIKE THE REST OF US OPERATE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS COULD YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO FUNCTION. IT DOESN'T WORK AND THAT'S EVIDENT FROM WORKING HERE ON BOTH SIDES THAT THE SENATE SIDE AND IS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. CONSECUTIVE LANGUAGE WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO SMALL BUSINESSES I REALIZE YOU WENT FROM ZERO TO FIVE EMPLOYEES AND THERE'S A PERCENAGE OF EMPLOYEES IT WOULD BE SPARED FOR EMPLOYERS THAT WOULD BE SPARED FROM THIS. BUT THIS ALSO DOES NOT CREATE CONSECUTIVE LANGUAGE SO A PERSON. THAT CAN TAKE OFF AS A TRUCK DRIVER. EVERY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY FOR FIFTY TWO WEEKS BECAUSE THEY DON'T EQUAL OUT THAT THE WHOLE TIME FRAME RIGHT THE FIFTY TWO WEEKS THE A QUANTITY OF EIGHT HOURS. BECAUSE IT'S NOT CONSECUTIVE. HOW DOES MY COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER FIERY TRACK DRIVER IT HAS TO BE. UNDER A DOT TEST HAS TO HAVE A PERFORMANCE EVALUATION HAS TO HAVE DOT REQUIREMENTS IN DUTY QUALIFICATIONS. TO FILL IN TWO DAYS A WEEK. IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. IF YOU LOOK AT LIKE HE SAID WITH AB FIVE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE OPTOMETRISTS GIVE OPHTHALMOLOGIST YOU HAVE INDIVIDUALS IF THEY TAKE TIME OFF AND THEY CAN'T GET THEIR EYES CHECKED. YOU HAVE ALL THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE AFFECTED AND THE LAWS THAT ARE PASSED HERE. IN THIS IS JUST. ONE MORE NAIL IN THE COFFIN I USED TO SAY ITS DEATH BY A THOUSAND PAPER CUTS BUT IT'S REALLY NOT DEATH BY ITS DEATH BY STAB WOUND NOW. I MEAN IT'S REALLY BAD FOR BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY OUT THERE WHEN THEY'RE BARELY TRYING TO SURVIVE. THE GOVERNOR JUST SHUT DOWN NINETEEN COUNTIES IN RESTAURANTS WITHNO DATA TO SHOW THAT IT'S RESTAURANTS THAT'S CAUSING. THE ISSUE THERE'S NO DOUBT AND THERE'S NO THERE'S NOTHING THAT SAYS CONTRACTORS YOUR SAY IT GOES BACK TO. THIS RESTAURANT SO THESE RESTAURANTS ARE SHUT DOWN SOME OF THEM HAVE SMALL FAMILY RESTAURANTS FIVE TEN PEOPLE AND NOW THEY'RE BE AFFECTED BY THIS. WE'RE NOW THEY CAN'T THEY CAN'T EVEN EMPLOYEES COME BACK TO WORK AFTER PROTECT THAT JOB. FIND SOMEBODY REPLACE THAT PERSONAL GONE. DAYS A WEEK ONE DAY A WEEK TWELVE CONCERT WEEKS. BRING THOSE TWELVE COULD WEEKS. THE EASIER TO FILL THAT POSITION FOR TWELVE WEEKS AND THEN LET THE PERSON GO. MANY GUYS PROBABLY MAKE UP SOME LOSSES KEEP LET SOMEBODY GO. IT IT'S JUST ABSURD WHAT GUYS DO TO THE PRIVATE. SECTOR I'M ASKING YOU- JUST GIVE US A BREAK. GIVE ALL THESE PEOPLE THESE THOUSANDS HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF BUSINESSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE OPPORTUNITY TO JUST GET BACK TO NORMAL OR WHATEVER NORMAL IS GONNA LOOK LIKE. AND THEN PROVIDE PEOPLE A JOB AND NOT HAVE TO DEAL WITH AGAIN ANOTHER PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT IS GOING TO HAMPER AND INHIBIT THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE A QUALITY PRODUCT TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE THEIR BUSINESS I URGE IN ABOUT. THANK YOU SENATOR GROW SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON MADAM PRESIDENT. I FELT COMPELLED TO STAND BECAUSE I THINK OUR COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE FREQUENTLY SUGGESTS THAT PERHAPS THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO HAD EXPERIENCE RUNNING BUSINESS BEFORE WE BECAME ELECTED THAT THEY HAVE A POINT IN THE MARKET OF. OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO RUN A SMALL BUSINESS TO BE AN EMPLOYER AND THAT'S JUST NOT THE CASE LIKE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES I RAN A BUSINESS BEFORE I WAS ELECTED TO OFFICE. NOW THE CHAMBER WILL HONORED AS A JUST BECAUSE WITH THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION BUT I MADE PAYROLL. I PAY PAYROLL TAXES. I PROVIDED BENEFITS. I HAD TO ABIDE BY ALL OF THE LABOR LAWS THAT IMPACT ANY BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHEN TIMES GOT TOUGH I HAD TO MAKE THE DECISION TO LAY OFF EMPLOYEES. I HAD TO MAKE THE DECISION AT ONE POINT TWO NO LONGER PROVIDE HEALTH BENEFITS TO YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY UNIT WE HAD TO MAKE THE DECISION WE INCREASE THE POLICE A SHARE OF THE PLAY BENEFITS. I RAN A BUSINESS. I WAS VERY PROUD IN RUNNING THE BUSINESS NGUYEN. PAID FAMILY LEAVE CAME INTO. OUR FRUITION THAT MY FIRST EMPLOYEE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT WAS A MALE EMPLOYEE. WHOSE Y. ARE DELIVERED TWINS A BIT PREMATURELY. AND I WAS PROUD OF THE FACT THOSE YOUNG GIRLS WERE NOW COLLEGE AGE- THAT THAT THEIR FATHER WAS ABLE TO SPEND TIME BONDING AT A VERY CRITICAL PERIOD. IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT. I WAS ALSO PROUD TO RUN A BUSINESS THAT WAS RECOGNIZED IN THOSE YOU KNOW RANKING SO. ON THE BEST COMPANY EMPLOYER TO WORK FOR. TO BE RECOGNIZED MULTIPLE YEARS. AND WE WERE RECOGNIZE NOT BECAUSE I WAS PAYING TOP OF SCALE BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE WORK WE WERE COMPETING WITH GOVERNMENT QUITE FRANKLY GOVERNMENT COULD PAY BETTER HAD THEIR RETIREMENT BENEFITS. BUT WE ALWAYS GOT THE RANKING IS BEING A PREFERRED EMPLOYER. BECAUSE OF THE KINDS OF POLICIES THAT WE PUT IN PLACE AS AN EMPLOYER. BECAUSE WE WERE NOT GOING TO CREATE THIS BIG DIVIDE BETWEEN THE HAVES AND THE HAVE NOTS THAT YOU OFTEN HEAR IN THESE DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND THE PEOPLE WHO. HELP THEIR BUSINESSES FUNCTION BY BEING THEIR EMPLOYEES. WE WANTED TO CREATE A CULTURE IN WHICH PEOPLE WANTED TO COME TO WORK AND GIVE THEIR BEST EFFORT TO HELP US DELIVER THE BEST PRODUCT POSSIBLE BY BEING CONSCIOUS OF THEIR LIVES AND SO WE WERE PROUD TO BE ABLE TO PUT. OUR POLICY IN PLACE AROUND FAMILY LEAVE WE WERE PROUD TO SUPPORT EMPLOYEES WHO WERE SICK BY ALLOWING OTHER EMPLOYEES TO DONATE TIME WE WERE PROUD TO DO THAT AND IT SHOWED IN TERMS OF THE WORK PRODUCT. THE LOW TURNOVER. OF MY EMPLOYEES. AND SO WHAT HAVE THOSE EXPERIENCES TO. I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL THAT SOME OF US HAVE HAD GREAT INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES WITH EMPLOYERS WHO LOVE US. ALLOW US TO TAKE TIME TO TAKE CARE OF OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDPARENTS THAT'S WONDERFUL. THAT'S OUR INDIVIDUAL LIFE EXPERIENCE. AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WHO WORK FOR COMPANIES WHO DON'T HAVE THOSE POLICIES AND DON'T HAVE THOSE PROTECTIONS THAT'S THE POINT OF A LOT MAKING. WELL THEN I WOULD SAY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE DIFFERENTIATE. UNDER THE LAW SALARIED EMPLOYEES AND THE WORK EXPECTATION OF A SALARIED EMPLOYEE VERSUS AN HOURLY EMPLOYEE IT'S NOT. OKAY TO STAND ON THE FLOOR AND MAKE ASSERTIONS AND JUST MAKE THE STATEMENTS BECAUSE YOU DON'T SUPPORT A BILL THAT MAY NOT BE ACCURATE. ARE SALARIED EMPLOYEES ARE EXPECTED TO DO THE JOB UNTIL THE JOB IS DONE HOURLY EMPLOYEES YOU ALL ARE WELL AWARE THERE'S A DIFFERENT LEGAL EXPECTATION. AND I'M SURE THAT THIS HOUSE AND ALL OF US IS EMPLOYER HONOR THAT- I AM PROUD TO STAND UP AND SUPPORT SB ONE THREE EIGHT THREE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR OVERALL. EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE ENVIRONMENT. IT'S TRAGIC THAT IN THIS COUNTRY OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO IDENTIFIED THAT WE CONTINUE TO WHEN WE HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS LIST. LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT DO LOBBY ON BEHALF OF BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION THE CONTEXT OF HAVE VERSUS HAVE NOTS US VERSUS THEM. IF BUSINESS IS IN PROTECTED AND THE AND THE WHOLE ECONOMY WILL TANK I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WE HAVE TO CREATE A SENSE OF BALANCE. BUT GOVERNMENT HAD TO INTERVENE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS AN EIGHT HOUR DAY AND A FORTY HOUR WORK WEEK THAT CHILD LABOR LAWS WERE CREATED THAT WE AGAIN CREATED PROTECTIONS FOR SALARY VERSUS HOURLY EMPLOYEES. THAT WORK PLACES HAVE TO BE INTEGRATED. THAT WOMEN COULD ALSO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK OUTSIDE OF THE HOME IF YOU WILL AND SO THERE HAS BEEN A CONSTRUCTIVE IMPORTANT HEALTH THE ROLE THAT GOVERNMENT IS PLAY. IN MAKING SURE THE BUSINESS IN THIS COUNTRY DOESN'T VIOLATE THE BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE THEY EMPLOY FOR ALL THOSE REASONS I WILL CONTINUE SUPPORT THIS CONCEPT ABOUT HOW WE CREATE A SOCIETY IN WHICH- FAMILY IS SUPPORTED. AND PEOPLE AREN'T FORCED TO MAKE A CHOICE. MANY OF HIS HERE ON THE FLOOR I'VE BEEN HERE LONG ENOUGH NOW THAT I LOST APPEARANCE INSERTED IN THE SENATE. I MADE THE CHOICE TO MISS ONE DAY ON THIS FOR WHEN MY MOTHER DIED. THE CHOICE I MADE. BUT PEOPLE SHOULD BE FORCED BASED ON THEIR EMPLOYMENT STATUS TO DECIDE WHAT ROLE THEY'RE GOING PLAY IN SUPPORTING THEIR FAMILIES IN THE RIGHT IN GREATEST NEED CALIFORNIA IS THE STATE THAT CHAMPION ALL OF THE RESEARCH AND ZERO TO FIVE BRING DEVELOPMENT. FOR WE CLAIM WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF BONDING WITH CHILDREN. WE CLAIM WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF SCHOOL READINESS WE CLAIM WE CARE ABOUT CHILDREN AND HAVE FAMILY VALUES. THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF EXHIBITING AND OPERATIONALIZE IN YOUR BELIEF IN CORE FAMILY VALUES WHICH IS WHAT I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL CENTER GLAZER. CORD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT TO. AND NUMBERS. WE CAN WE CAN TOGETHER THIS MORNING AT A VERY SAD TIME. OUR STATE FOR OUR WORLD. MORE THAN TEN MILLION PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD HAVE BEEN INFECTED BY THE CORONA VIRUS. NUMBER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE DIED. JUST YESTERDAY IN THE UNITED STATES. FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE NOTIFIED THAT THEY HAD BEEN INFECTED. JUST YESTERDAY. AND HEY HERE IN OUR STATE. JUST THE FIRST THREE DAYS OF THIS WEEK. TWENTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WE'RE TOLD THAT THEY HAVE THAT CODE NINETEEN VIRUS. AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PLUS. OF OUR CALIFORNIA FAMILY DIED THIS WEEK JUST SO FAR. IF YOU SAID TO ME THAT THE LEGISLATION BEFORE US. I WAS GOING TO A GOING TO AFFECT THOSE WHO WERE FACING THIS TERRIBLE HAND DOWN AT. I WOULD BE THE FIRST TO SAY I WANT TO VOTE FOR THAT BILL. YOU KNOW. THE GOVERNOR'S ORDER ON MARCH SIXTEENTH SAID THAT IF YOU'RE- SIXTY FIVE YEARS OUR OLDER OR YOU HAVE AN UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION. THAT YOU MUST SHELTER IN PLACE. PERIOD THAT ORDER REMAINS IN EFFECT THE EXCEPTION WAS THAT IF YOU HAD TO UNDERTAKEN ESSENTIAL ACTIVITY. TO GET FOOD OR MEDICINE. FOR US AS SENATORS THAT ESSENTIAL ACTIVITY IS BEING HERE ON THE FLOOR AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME DESPITE THE RISKS TO ALL OF US AND NOT JUST THOSE WHO ARE. PARK PARK. REPRESENT THAT GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE VULNERABLE BUT YOUR FAMILY'S ANYONE WHO YOU'RE LIVING WITH. AND SO. ONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS THIS MORNING FOR ME. IS THIS BILL AN ESSENTIAL BILL. IS THIS JUSTIFY OUR PRESENCE HERE ON THE FLOOR. IT JUSTIFIES THAT ESSENTIAL ACTIVITY FOR US THE SENATORS. NOW DURING MANY FLOOR DEBATE HERE INSIDE AND ALSO OUTSIDE THESE CHAMBERS. WE HEAR. I DESIRE TO GO AFTER THAT. THE TITANS ON WALL STREET. THE BIGGEST COMPANIES IN THE WORLD IN THEIR PROFITS. WE NEED TO CREATE A BALANCE AND FAIRNESS IN OUR WORLD. BUT MEMBERS DOES THE BILL BEFORE US TODAY DO THAT. IS IT TARGET THOSE BIG WEALTHY COMPANIES IN OUR WORLD THE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES. I THINK WE ALL KNOW THE ANSWER IS NOW. IT DOESN'T DO THAT. THIS BILL IS TARGETED TOWARDS THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. A SMALL SHOPKEEPER THE SMALL RESTAURANT OWNER.THAT TARGETED TOWARDS THE BIG WEALTHY COMPANIES IN OUR WORLD. I HAVE HEARD. SOME OF THE DEBATE THIS MORNING. A SUGGESTION THAT THIS LEGISLATION AND ITS ECONOMIC IMPACT HAS BEEN STUDY. THOROUGHLY THOUGHTFULLY IN DEATH. AND I WOULD CHALLENGE THAT ASSERTION. WHEN HAVE WE EVER EXPERIENCED A PANDEMIC THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING TODAY WHAT HAVE WE EVER EXPERIENCED A TIME IN WHICH TENS OF THOUSANDS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. ARE CLOSED AT THIS MOMENT. WITH FEARS THAT THEY MAY NEVER. OPEN AGAIN. SENATE BILL. IN THE QUIET AT THIS MOMENT. I HEAR. THAT SHOPKEEPER AT HOME. CRYING. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO. WITH THE SITUATION WHICH THEY FIND THEMSELVES AT. ALL THAT HARD WORK. ALL THAT SAVINGS. ALL. THE COURAGE THAT IT TOOK TO THE OPEN UP THAT SHOT. AND NOW WHAT ARE THEY GOING. TO DO. AND WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE IMPACT. ON THEIR FAMILY. ON THEIR CHILDREN. WHAT ARE THE CHOICES THAT THEY MAY FACE. LOSING HEALTHCARE LOSING EVERYTHING ALL THEIR DREAMS. LOS. AND WHAT OF THEIR WORKERS. WHETHER IT'S FIVE OR FIFTEEN. WHAT AT ONE OF THEIR LIVES NOW AFFECTED. AND WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THEIR CIRCUMSTANCE. WHEN THEY LOSE THEIR JOB. THERE'S NO HEALTHCARE THERE'S NOTHING THERE'S NO PAYCHECK THERE'S NOTHING. SO WITH A QUIET AT THIS MOMENT I THINK ABOUT THAT SHOPKEEPER. AND THEIR MUFFLED CRIES IN THE BACK ROOM BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THEIR FAMILY TO KNOW THE SORROW THAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH. AND WHO ARE THE SHOPKEEPERS. THERE IMMIGRANTS THE REFUGEES. THERE PEOPLE OF COLOR THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO MAYBE DIDN'T EVEN GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL BUT THEY'VE SCRAP TOGETHER THE MONEY TO TRY TO CREATE AN ENTERPRISE TO TRY TO MAKE A BETTER LIFE FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. SO ARE WE HEAR ON THE SENATE FLOOR. DEBATING A MEASURE THAT WILL HOUSE THE HOMELESS. FEED THE HUNGRY. PROVIDE RELIEF FOR THOSE WHO HAVE LOST A JOB. IS THAT THE ESSENTIAL WORK IN WHICH WE'VE COME TOGETHER THIS MORNING THE DEBATE. I THINK THE ANSWER IS. THAT DOES NOT MATCH THE LEGISLATION THAT'S BEFORE US. I THINK ONE OF THE HARDEST JOBS FOR A SENATOR. IS WHEN ONE GETS A MEASURE THAT IS COMES FROM THE BIGGEST HEART. THE MOST A PLACE OF THE GREATEST COMPASSION. THAT WE KNOW HAS THE BEST OF INTENTIONS TO MAKE OUR WORLD AND MAKE EACH OF OUR LIVES BETTER. WHEN WE WHEN THAT LEGISLATION COMES IN FRONT OF US AND YET THE CIRCUMSTANCES OR THE BUDGET. JUST DOESN'T. MAKE THAT MOMENT WHERE YOU HAVE TO SAY YES I'D LIKE TO DO THAT BUT- IT'S THE HARDEST THING TO SAY NO. NOT TODAY. NOT RIGHT NOW. I'M GONNA LEAVE IT TO OTHERS TO TALK ABOUT. THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN THIS LEGISLATION AND THE CONSEQUENCES THAT MIGHT MAKE. I'M GONNA LEAVE ASIDE THE ISSUE OF THE FACT THAT THIS IS A BUDGET TRAILER BILL. THE WARPING OF THE PROCESS. CREATES PRESSURES I EACH OF YOU THAT WOULDN'T BE THERE THIS WAS A NORMAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS IN THE PROPER WAY. I KNOW I KNOW THAT THIS BILL WILL PASS TODAY I KNOW THAT. I GET IT. BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE THE WAY THAT WE DO OUR BEST TO WORK IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH WE FIND OURSELVES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC. WITH CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE STILL COMPLETELY UNIMAGINABLE. THE PROPONENTS HAVE A BIG HEART. THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. AND A DIFFERENT MOMENTS IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE ADVANCED. ALTHOUGH I KNOW IT'LL BE ADVANCE HERE TODAY. BUT IN THIS QUIET MOMENTS I DO HERE. SIGN OF THAT SHOPKEEPER. AND I THINK THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO PUT. ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS ON DOWN WITHOUT FULL STUDY AND REVIEW. AND WITH THAT I UNFORTUNATELY WILL BE CASTING A NO VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER CENTER MELINDA'S THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. WHEN I FIRST GOT TO LEGISLATURE- THE MANTRA WAS GENERALLY THAT BIG BUSINESS WAS THE ENEMY THAT WE HAD TO GO AFTER THERE'S CORPORATE GREEDY- GIANTS WHO WERE NOT DOING RIGHT BY THEIR EMPLOYEES AND IT SEEMS AS THOUGH NOW WE HAVE TAKEN APOLOGIZE IN GOING AFTER THE BIG BUSINESSES THAT EMPLOY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO AFTER THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ARE NOT. EVIL THEY CARE ABOUT THEIR EMPLOYEES. I. I DO I HAVE TO PAUSE FOR A MOMENT AND BANK- THE GOOD SENATORS FROM LOS ANGELES AND SANTA BARBARA IN BERKELEY FOR ACTUALLY MAKING THE POINT TODAY AND THEIR COMMENTS ABOUT THEIR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCES ABOUT WHY THIS BILL ISN'T NECESSARY. BECAUSE THEY TALKED ABOUT HOW THEIR EMPLOYER. ALLOW THEM THE TIME OFF WHEN THEY NEEDED IT OR THAT THEY ALLOW THEIR EMPLOYEES THE TIME OFF WHEN THEY NEEDED IT WITHOUT THE BIG HAND OF GOVERNMENT COMING DOWN AND SMACKING THEM AND SAYING THAT THEY HAD TO DO IT. THIS IS WHAT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS DO BECAUSE THEY VALUE THEIR EMPLOYEES THEY WANT TO KEEP THEM IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE TO TRAIN SOMEONE NEW AND MOST TIMES YOU DON'T WANT TO BECAUSE YOU REALLY DO BECOME. LIKE A FAMILY. BUT I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE FIVE EMPLOYEES. AND. HAVE THAT PERSON LEAVE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME IN TRYING TO FIND SOMEONE ELSE TO REPLACE THEM WHETHER IT'S CONSECUTIVE DAYS ARE NOT WHICH I THINK IS A VERY INTERESTING POINT I HOPE THE AUTHOR- ADDRESSES IN HER CLOTHES AS PROMISED. THIS CORONA VIRUS HAS DECIMATED YOU KNOW UR ECONOMY EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT IN HERE AND I DON'T KNOW WHEN IT'S GOING TO COME BACK NONE OF US DO. BUT I DO KNOW WHEN EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM KNOWS THAT THE SMALL BUSINESSES ARE THE ONES WHO ARE HURTING THE MOST. IF ANYBODY WATCH THE NEWS LAST NIGHT THE LOCAL NEWS. THEY WERE INTERVIEWING THE OWNER OF SU ON TRIPS RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO HE'S NOW YOU KNOW HE'S- CLEANING TABLES HE'S DOING THE SHOPPING HE'S DOING THE COOKING HE'S DOING EVERYTHING JUST TO TRY TO STAY OPEN AND NOT LOSE THE BUSINESS. AND THAT IS GOING TO CONTINUE FORWARD. I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW HOW LONG. BUT TO PUT A POLICY LIKE THIS IN PLACE AT A TIME WHEN BUSINESS OWNERS AREN'T EVEN SURE IF THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE IT I THINK IS INCREDIBLY IRRESPONSIBLE. AND I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO THE EMPLOYEES AND I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO THE EMPLOYERS. SO I WOULD URGE YOU TO PIES AT THIS MOMENT REALLY THINK. ABOUT THE EFFECT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE. ON THOSE SMALLER BUSINESSES BECAUSE- POLICIES LIKE THIS ARE WHAT RIVE THEM OUT OF CALIFORNIA OR CAUSE THEM TO CLOSE COMPLETELY NEVER TO RETURN SO I WOULD URGE AN EVENT THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU CENTER MELINDA'S CENTER MORE LAW. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT OF. BEING PART OF IMMIGRANT FAMILY WE IMMIGRATED TO THE ORANGE COUNTY OF MY DAD HAD TO START OVER HE HAD A- ED NO REASON TO LEAVE THE NETHERLANDS BUT- IF I'M SELF GOING INTO SALES. SPUR SELLING INSURANCE AND SO INSURANCE. YOU KNOW THERE ARE DAYS- WHEN YOU HAVE A GOOD GOOD WEEKS AND IN YOUR TIMES WERE YOU HAVE- DRY SPELLS BUT HE WOULD CERTAINLY WORK VERY LONG HOURS AND SO. THERE ARE TIMES THE CHILD THAT WOULD GO TO MY MOTHER AND ASK FOR SOMETHING. MY MOTHER WHO WHO TURNS NINETY THIS MONTH- I'D ASK- IN THE STORE AT HOME HE CAN CAN YOU BUY ME THIS. AND SHE WOULD JUST. TURNED TO ME AND SAY SON. IF I HAD A MILLION DOLLARS I GIVE IT TO YOU. IT WAS ONE OF HER PARENTS TAPES I WOULD HEAR IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER PARENT CAPE SIR WHEN YOU. HEAR YOUR PARENTS SAY THE SAME THING LIKE YOU KNOW JIMMY'S GONNA JUMP OFF THE BRIDGE THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO JUMP OFF THE BRIDGE AND DOLLARS. INTERESTING PHRASES BUT IT WAS HER WAY OF SAYING SON. WE'D WE CAN'T AFFORD IT. RIGHT NOW. AND I UNDERSTOOD THAT AND IT'S ALL SHE HAD TO SAY. SON OF I HAD A MILLION DOLLARS TO GIVE IT TO YOU AND THAT WAS THE END OF OUR DISCUSSION I WOULDN'T NAGGAR FORMER BUSINESS OWNER I APPRECIATE FAMILY LEAVE. AS A GRANDFATHER I APPRECIATETHEM RELIEF I HAVE FRIENDS WITH WORKING SPOUSES AND- MY DAUGHTER IN LAW'S ENJOYING. FAMILY LEAVE AS WE SPEAK AND I WAS INFORMED THIS WEEKEND THAT MY OTHER SON OF WILL BE ENJOYING FAMILY LEAVE AND FEBRUARY OF NEXT YEAR SO. I UNDERSTAND. SB THIRTY THREE IS A STRETCH GOAL. BUT THERE'S THE FLIP SIDE. AND THAT IS THE BENEFIT. BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT'S A LITTLE HARDER AS AS MANY OF SAID ON THE ON THE FLOOR IT REQUIRES A TEMPORARY REPLACEMENT OF THE NECESSARY POSITION AND NOW MAY BE UP TO TWELVE WEEKS WITH JOB PROTECTION. THAT'S THAT'S ADMIRABLE THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE BUT IT'S A STRETCH GOAL IT TAKES IT A LITTLE FARTHER WE'VE BEEN DOING FAMILY LEAVE BUT NOW WE'RE TAKING A LITTLE FURTHER WITH SOME PRETTY SERIOUS. PARAMETERS AND AS HAS BEEN STATED WE'RE IN A UNIQUE ECONOMIC FREE FALL WHERE MANY BUSINESSES HAVE HAD THEIR RESERVES DEPLETED. AND MANY MORE HAVE HEADED TO BANKRUPTCY COURTS. AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF STATES THAT WOULD LOVE TO HAVE OUR BUSINESSES. FOR COLLEAGUES THIS BILL IS POOR TIMING. BUSINESSES NEEDRELIEF NOT MORE COSTS RESULTING FROM STEPPING SHORTAGE EXTENSIONS OR POTENTIALLY RETAIN AN ATTORNEY BECAUSE THE STATUS SHOWED UP AT THEIR FRONT DOOR THE DEAL WITH AN ALLEGED VIOLATION. SO I FULLY UNDERSTAND. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. BUT LET'S WAIT ON SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE I URGE A NO VOTE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU CENTER MORLOCK CENTER GALGIANI. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF MY QUESTION IS TO THE AUTHOR OF THE AUTHOR WOULD TAKE A QUESTION PLEASE. SENATOR JACKSON'S. TO DO SO AND- ANSWERED MY CLOTHES THANK YOU- I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. MY CONCERN IS THAT- AS A MEMBER I'VE BEEN HERE FOR DISCUSSIONS ON FAMILY LEAVE IN THE PAST THAT WHEN THIS BILL CAME UP AND IT WASN'T YET IMPRINT. EVEN I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE DIFFERENT LEAVES WERE THE AMOUNT OF TIME WHETHER THEY WERE PAID AND PAID- AND HAD TO. TRY TO DO SOME RESEARCH WE HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT IT. IF I DIDN'T REMEMBER IT I HAVE CONCERNS THAT AN EMPLOYER ESPECIALLY IN EMPLOYER WITHOUT LEGAL COUNSEL AND AN EMPLOYER WHO IS NOT A MEMBER. OF THE CHAMBER FOR EXAMPLE. HOW THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP TRACK OF THIS BECAUSEI'M SURE THAT WITH THE FINANCIAL SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN THAT THERE WON'T BE NOTIFICATIONS. SENT TO BUSINESSES FULL OF A BUSINESS OWNER MAKES A MISTAKE AND TELLS AN EMPLOYEE INITIALLY. THAT I CAN'T AFFORD TO ALLOW YOU TO TAKE THE TIME OFF. IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO CARE FOR THAT BUSINESS OWNER. IF INDEED THEY LEARNED THAT I'M WRONG THE LAW SAYS THIS I'M REQUIRED TO GIVE THAT EMPLOYEE LEAVE. IS THAT EMPLOYERS STILL SUBJECT TO A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THAT'S MY QUESTION. THANK YOU. THE CENTER GALGIANI THINK. IT'S AN ADDRESSING THAT IN YOUR CLOTHES SENATOR TO RAZA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I AM- I RISE IN IT IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND I SO APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE AUTHOR- I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE ALL THOSE YEARS BUT- FROM THE STORIES I CAN TELL SHE HAS PERSEVERED AND JUST STUCK WITH IT. AND I AM VERY PROUD TO BE HERE AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT- I TRY TO LOOK AT THINGS THROUGH THE LENS OF WHAT'S FOR THE GREATER GOOD. OF BECAUSE THE ALWAYS BE SOME. CONFLICT OF THIS OPINION OVER THAT OPINION BUT WHAT'S FOR THE GREATER GOOD. THIS BILL IS GOING TO ENSURE THAT MILLIONS. OF CALIFORNIANS. WHO PAY INTO PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND OTHER BENEFITS THAT THEY DO SO WITHOUT RISKING THEIR JOBS. THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL THING WITHOUT RISKING THEIR JOBS IN RIGHT NOW THERE ARE MILLIONS. WHO CAN BE FIRED FOR TAKING TIME OFF IS BASED ON THE EMPLOYER SIZE. SO WHETHER YOU HAVE FIVE COWORKERS ARE FIVE HUNDRED YOUR CHILDREN AND ILL LOVED ONES NEED TO JUST THE SAME. NO ONE SHOULD BE FIRED BECAUSE THEY HAVE A CHILD OR GET CANCER OR NEED TO BE WITH THE DYING PARENT. AS A LATINA WOMAN WHO'S WORKED WITH LOW WAGE WORKERS MOST OF MY ADULT LIFE. TO SEE THAT LOW WAGE WORKERS WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO WORK FOR SMALL EMPLOYERS THEREFORE CURRENTLY LACK JOB PROTECTION. MOST WORKERS PAY IN. OF AN OUT OF EVERY SINGLE CHECK BUT LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO USE IT THAN HIGHER WAGE WORKERS. AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN WORKERS WHO ARE LESS THAN TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MADE UP. ALMOST 40% OF THE WORKFORCE YET THEY ONLY REPRESENTED A LITTLE OVER 20% OF THE CLAIMS HIGHER EARNERS HAD HIGHER UTILIZATION RATES THIS MEANS THAT PEOPLE EARNING LOW WAGES ARE SUBSIDIZING HIGHER PAID WORKERS. PEOPLE EARNING LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE AWARE BUT A TOP REASON THAT DAY REPORT FOR NOT USING IT IS FEAR OF LOSING THEIR JOB FEAR OF LOSING THEIR JOB. CALIFORNIA LED THE NATION IN IMPLEMENTING- PAID FAMILY LEAVE SIXTEEN YEARS AGO BUT WE'VE NOW FALLEN BEHIND. WERE OTHER STATES MASSACHUSETTS NEW YORK CONNECTICUT AND OTHERS HAVE GOTTEN AHEAD OF US. IT IS TIME TO UPDATE OUR LAW. SO THAT WE'RE NOT DISCUSSING THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UPDATING IT SO THAT HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN CAN BE THERE FOR THEIR FAMILIES WITHOUT RISKING THEIR JOBS. MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE ASKING FOR THIS PROTECTION. I BET IF EVERYONE TOOK A POLL IN YOUR DISTRICT AND ASKED. ASK YOUR RESIDENTS ASK YOUR YOUR- VOTERS IN THOSE AREAS. F. IF THEY THOUGHT IT WAS FAIR FOR SOMEONE TO GET FIRED AFTER TAKING A LEAVE LIKE THIS I BET EVERY BUT MAJORITY WOULD SAY NO IT'S NOT FAIR WE DO SUPPORT A LAW THAT GAVE PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO GO BACK TO THEIR JOBS YES. I BET YOU THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY WOULD SAY YES. SO THE EMPLOYERS TO DO RIGHT RIGHT NOW BY THEIR EMPLOYEES. GREAT I'M REALLY GLAD TO SEE THAT I KNOW THAT THEY EXIST I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY WHO DO IT. THEY'VE GOT NOTHING TO LOSE. BUT THOSE WHO DON'T DO RIGHT. I'LL HAVE TO LEARN TO DO RIGHT BY THEIR EMPLOYEES. IF NOT NOW WHEN IS ALWAYS AN EXCUSE. COLLEAGUES I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU SENATOR AS A GOOD MORNING CENTER LEYVA THE FLOORS OR- THANK YOU MISTER FOR A PRESIDENT FOR ALLOWING ME TO USE YOUR DESK GOOD MORNING MEMBERS. AS A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL AND THE CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS I RISE IN STRONG BUT DISAPPOINTED SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE EXPANDS ACCESS TO PAID FAMILY LEAVE BY PROVIDING JOB PROTECTION TO VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA EMPLOYEES WOMEN ESPECIALLY. FAMILY LEAVE AS LONG BEEN A PRIORITY FOR THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT FAMILY LEAVE THAT IS JOB PROTECTED AND ADEQUATELY PAID IS ESSENTIAL FOR WOMEN'S EQUALITY AND SUCCESS IN THE WORKFORCE. WITH MORE WOMEN IN THE WORK FORCE THAN EVER BEFORE WE CAN NO LONGER TAKE FOR GRANTED THE WORK OF CARE GIVING THAT WOMEN LONG PERFORMED WITHOUT RECOGNITION OR PAY. WE MUST MAKE SPACE FOR CARE GIVING AS PART OF THE WORK ENVIRONMENT. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT WHEN THESE IMPORTANT ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE. CHOOSE THE LIVES OF WOMEN IN PRIZE IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THE ENTIRE FAMILY. JOB PROTECTED THE FAMILY LEAVE INCREASES WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION IN THE LABOR FORCE I MAKES NEW MOTHERS MORE LIKELY TO RETURN AFTER CHILDBIRTH WHICH I THINK THAT SOMETIMES WE TAKE FOR GRANTED WE ACT LIKE GROWING A HUMAN FRIEND INSIDE OF YOU AND THEN BIRTHING THEM IS NOT THAT DIFFICULT. SO THE WOMEN WHO ARE WOMEN THE ONLY WITH ALL WOMEN ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN HAVE A CHILD. THEIR BODIES NEED TO RECUPERATE AFTER THAT AND THE SENATOR FROM OAKLAND I AM SHOCKED THAT YOU HAVE TO COME BACK TO WORK AFTER TWO WEEKS OF THAT JUST SEEMS UNCONSCIONABLE. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT STRONG INEQUITABLE FAMILY LEAVE POLICIES ENCOURAGE FATHERS TO TAKE LEAVE AS WELL. RESULTING IN MORE EQUITABLE SHARING OF CAREGIVING RESPONSIBILITIES. WHEN IS ABSENT. LIMóN LIKELY END UP LEAVING THE WORKFORCE ALTOGETHER. SOME TO RETURN YEARS LATER AND THE END RESULT IS A WIDENING AND THE PAY GAP LOSS OF EARNING POTENTIAL. LARA RETIREMENT BENEFITS THIS BILL CRITICAL FOR ALL. BUT CLEARLY MAKES INCREDIBLE STRIDES AND HELPING TO UPLIFT WOMEN. HOWEVER I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT MENTION THAT I AM DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED BY SOME OF MY DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES. AND WHILE THIS BILL WILL HAVE GREAT IMPACT THEIR SHIP MORE WORK TO BE DONE. EVERY YEAR EVEN HERE TWENTY TWENTY. THE REALITY IS THAT THERE WILL BE SOME WOMEN WHO GIVE BIRTH AND WILL NOT HAVE ACCESS TO JOE ACCESS TO JOB PROTECTED PREGNANCY DISABILITY LEAVE. AS WAS STATED BY THE AUTHOR YOU PAY IN YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE IT. CALIFORNIA CAN AND MUST DO BETTER. I TO HEAR PEOPLE CRYING. I HEAR WOMEN CRYING WOMEN WHO GIVE BIRTH AND HAVE TO LEAVE THEIR CHILD TOO SOON TO GO BACK TO WORK BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE FOR THAT CHILD. MEMBERS WE HAVE MISSED A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND THIS TO ALL WOMEN. THIS BILL IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM WAS A STATEMENT OF OUR VALUES OF WHAT WE VALUE WHAT DO WE VALUE DO WE VALUE FAMILY. DO WE VALUE PEOPLE WHO GIVE BIRTH TO CHILDREN DO WE VALUE THAT. NO WE VALUE STATUS WE VALUE STUFF AND WE VALUE MONEY. WELL THE FOOD VALUE PEOPLE HEALTH CARE AND COMMUNITY WHAT WHAT OUR WORLD LOOK LIKE THEN. AS I STATED IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARING THIS IS NOT ABOUT A LACK OF HOW TO THIS IS ABOUT A LACK OF WILL TO. I TOO HAVE A DREAM LIKE MARTIN LUTHER KING DID. I HAVE A DREAM THAT SOME DAY ALL DEMOCRATS WILL SUPPORT WOMEN. I URGE AN AYE VOTE. BUT IT'S IN GERMAN THE SENATE WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO TO CENTER HER TARA. CENTER TITLE WE'RE GONNA HAVE YOU COME UP TO THE PODIUM HERE IN THE MIDDLE THE ROOM PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. COLLEAGUES WE CANNOT DENY THAT THERE IS AN AND JUSTICE WHEN IT COMES TO WHO CAN AND CANNOT TAKE PROTECTIVELY. THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND ABOUT THAT. FOR THIS REASON I HAVE MADE EVERY EFFORT TO SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION AND MAKE SURE IN THE PROCESS WE DON'T CREATE ANOTHER AND JUSTICE. FOR PEOPLE. OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS I HAVE SPENT NUMEROUS HOURS TALKING TO PEOPLE ACROSS MY SENATE DISTRICT THAT ARE OFTEN NOT HEARD. FROM AND FOR THOSE REASONS I AM SADDENED TO OPPOSE SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE TODAY. BUT I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU WHY. MY SENATE DISTRICT TESTY FOURTEEN. IS HOME TO SEVENTY THOUSAND. SMALL BUSINESSES. ONE THIRD OF THEM ARE MINORITY OWNED. CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING DURING THIS TIME AND THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE TO. IN MAKING MY DECISION I TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION THE STORIES OF THE PEOPLE I REPRESENT. AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU A FEW. CHONG HE A SMALL BUSINESS FARMER AND FRESNO COUNTY THAT IS STRUGGLING TO AND TO MAKE ENDS MEET. HE MAKES UP JUST ONE OF TWO THOUSAND ASIAN FARMERS AND FRESNO COUNTY ALONE. CHUNKY HAS RECEIVED NO SUPPORT OR FEDERAL AID. TECHNICAL LITERACY HAS BEEN A MAJOR CHALLENGE TO RESOURCES AND INFORMATION. A FARMER THAT WAS FORCED OUT OF HIS NATIVE HOME BUT HAS BEEN FIGHTING AND LOOKING FORWARD TO LIVING THE AMERICAN DREAM. I ALSO SPOKE WITH A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER ARIANNA. WHO IS ALSO JUST TRYING TO SEEK OPPORTUNITIES FOR HER HER FAMILY AND HER EMPLOYEES. SEC THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT ALL THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WE DON'T USUALLY HEAR FROM OR WE DON'T THINK OF. MAYBE SOME OF US TOO BUT- I THOUGHT ABOUT. YOU KNOW THE MEAT MARKET SECOND THE CITY S. THE TACO TRUCKS. ALL THOSE OWNERS BUSINESS OWNERS WHO DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH WHO CARE ABOUT THEIR EMPLOYEES AND WHO THE EMPLOYEES CARE ABOUT THEM AS WELL. THE COLLEAGUES I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL IN THE CURRENT FORMAT BUT HOLD FOR NEEDED AMENDMENTS TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE PEOPLE THAT WE DON'T OFTEN HEAR FROM THAT WILL ALSO BE IMPACTED. WE CAN ALL WIN. BUT WE MUST LISTEN TO EACH OTHER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR HER TITLE. MADAM PRO TEM. MADAM PRESIDENT MUCH ON A PART TIME I APOLOGIZE I THINK YOU WANT TO HAVE A LAST WORD ON THIS I JUST SAW SENATOR COVER EUROS MICROPHONE WHAT I'M GOOD OKAY EXCELLENT PLEASE THANK MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE. AND I APPLAUD THE COMMITMENT OF OUR GOVERNOR ON THIS ISSUE AND HIS- COMMITMENT AND COURAGE I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE AUTHOR FROM SANTA BARBARA- THIS IS BEEN AN ISSUE THAT SHE HAS CHAMPION FOR MANY YEARS SO THERE'S BEEN PLENTY OF DISCUSSION. ON THIS ISSUE. YOU KNOW SIXTEEN YEARS AGO SENATOR SHE LOOK YOU'LL PUT CALIFORNIA ON THE MAP ON FAMILY LEAVE WHEN SHE AUTHORED AND PASS THE NATION'S VERY FIRST PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM. IT WAS AN ACHIEVEMENT HAVING CALIFORNIA LEAD ON THIS ISSUE. BUT THAT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING OF WORK ON THIS ISSUE. THEY'VE BEEN A NUMBER OF SUBSEQUENT BILLS BUT NOTHING BIGGER THAN WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO VOTE ON TODAY. EVERY WORKER IN CALIFORNIA PAYS TAXES SPECIFICALLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF BEING ABLE TO TAKE A LEAVE. TO CARE FOR THEIR CHILD AFTER BIRTH OR SICK FAMILY MEMBER. AS THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE DOING RIGHT NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC. THE PROBLEM IS TOO MANY WORKERS ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN THE BENEFIT THAT THEY PAY FOR I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM EAST LA MADE COMMENTS DIRECTLY TO THIS POINT. PROVIDING A MOTHER WITH THE ABILITY TO RETURN TO THEIR JOB TWELVE WEEKS AFTER GIVING BIRTH TO ME IS SIMPLY WRITING A SOCIETAL WRONG. THAT HAS NEVER BEEN FIXED. DOES IT MEAN THAT IT'S EASY OR THAT IT DOESN'T COME WITHOUT COST AND CHALLENGES FOR BUSINESS.FOR THE COMMUNITY FOR SOCIETY NO I KNOWLEDGE THE CHALLENGES BUT I OWN LIFE EXPERIENCE. MY MOTHER DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE LEAVE WHEN ME. AND MY SIBLINGS WERE BORN. MY SISTER WASN'T ABLE TO TAKE LEAVE AFTER MY NEPHEW WAS BORN AND INSTEAD I TOOK THAT RESPONSIBILITY TO CARE FOR MY NEPHEW SO SHE COULD. RETURN TO DUTY. I AS A NAVY ENSIGN. AND SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HER CHILD SHE KNEW THAT THAT THAT HER SON WOULD BE TAKING CARE OF. YOU KNOW I THOUGHT IT A GREAT DEAL ABOUT MY MOM THESE LAST TWO WEEKS YOU KNOW TALKING ABOUT HER BEING A GARMENT WORKER LAST WEEK. IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR MY MOM DIED OF CANCER. MY SISTER WAS TAKING CARE OF HER AND HER HUSBAND AT THE SAME TIME. BOTH ARE BOTH DIED WITHIN A TWO WEEK PERIOD. I HAD TO WORK. I SAW MY MOM IN MAY IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR BEFORE SHE DIED IN AUGUST. BY JULY TWENTY EIGHTH I GOT A CALL FROM MY SISTER HER HUSBAND HAD DIED AND BECAUSE THEY WERE POLICIES THAT ALLOWED ME TO GO FOR BEREAVEMENT LEAVE. I COULD GO. TO MY SISTER'S HUSBAND'S FUNERAL AND I WAS VERY SAD BUT I WAS ALSO REALLY EXCITED I WAS GOING TO SEE MY MOTHER ONE MORE TIME I KNEW THAT I WOULD GET TO SEE HER ONE MORE TIME. BEFORE SHE DIED. I GOT TO TENNESSEE MY MOM. HAD BECOME COMATOSE. AND DIED A WEEK LATER. SO EIGHT YOU KNOW THESE HAVE REAL IMPACTS ON FAMILY MEMBERS. I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER HOW THE LOTS OF MY FAMILY AND MILLIONS OF OTHERS WILL BE DIFFERENT. IF MOM'S WERE ABLE TO TAKE THE TIME TO BE A MOTHER BEFORE RETURNING TO WORK OR IF A FAMILY MEMBER HAD THEABILITY TO BE THERE IN THE LAST MOMENTS OF A FAMILY MEMBER'S LIFE SOMETHING YOU DON'T GET TO DO OVER. THERE NO DO OVERS. YOU KNOW- I WOULD JUST COMMENT ON TO THE POINTS MADE BACK COLLEAGUES. YOU KNOW ARBITRARY TO MINUS OF EMPLOYERS IS IT CONSIST NOR INSURED. HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF PROOF OF ABUSE OF EMPLOYEES WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE EMPLOYERS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT. MANY EMPLOYERS HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT BECAUSE THEY CARE ABOUT THEIR WORKERS THOSE AREN'T EMPLOYERS OR EMPLOYEES. EMPLOYERS THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. I RECOGNIZE THAT. AND ANOTHER POINT. YOU KNOW PRIVATE BUSINESS REQUIRES WORKERS. IT IS A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP THAT. TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND GET THEIR NEEDS MET YOU CAN'T HAVE A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS WITHOUT WORKERS. AND SO YOU KNOW THERE'S NO REVENUE IF THERE'S NO SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP FOR ANY OF US TO DIVIDE UP OR THINK ABOUT OR DISCUSS WHO SHOULD PAY WIDEN. WHAT A MOUNTAIN AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS RELATED TO HOW WE HAVE THOSE DEBATES AND DISCUSSIONS. SO TODAY I GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO CAST A VOTE TO PROVIDE OVER EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS THE ABILITY TO DO WHAT MY MOM AND MY SISTER WERE ABLE TO DO AND HOPEFULLY THOSE FAMILIES NOT TO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. MAKING DECISIONS AS TO WHETHER THE GUY TAKE OFF WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO ARE NOT TO BE THERE. AT A CRITICAL MOMENT. SO FOR THAT REASON I WOULD ASK OF VOTE TODAY ON SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SENATOR ATKINS CENTER CABALLERO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I'M QUITE FRANKLY I. WASN'T GONNA STAND UP AND SPEAK BUT- I FEEL COMPELLED TO. WHEN THE CHARGE AGAINST ME IF I DON'T VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND I'VE BEEN VERY FRANK. IN ALL THE HEARINGS THAT I HAVE BEEN AS BOTH CHAIR OF SOME FOUR. AND IN THE BUDGET. THAT I HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH THIS. BUT TO- HAVE THE IMPLICATION. NO IT WASN'T THE IMPLICATION IT WAS ACTUALLY STATEMENT. THAT I WAS NOT A GOOD DEMOCRAT FOR A GOOD MEMBER OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS QUITE FRANKLY OFFENDS ME AND SO I HAVE TO STAND UP AND SAY SAY THAT- LIKE MAY MY GOOD FRIEND FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY I HAVE SPENT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME OVER THE PAST. SIX WEEKS SPEAKING TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN MY COMMUNITY NOT BECAUSE- I WAS DOING THE OUTREACH BUT BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY THEY WERE CALLING ME IN PANIC. MANY OF THEM WILL NEVER OPEN AGAIN. MANY OF THEM ARE STRUGGLING TO STAY AFLOAT DURING THESE VERY VERY DIFFICULT TIME. AND THEIR IMPLORING ME TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE DURING THE TIME THAT WE'RE IN SESSION. TO HELP THEM TO FIND THEM THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE I HAVE ALMOSTA HUNDRED THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES IN MY DISTRICT. AND A MAJORITY OF THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES ARE IMMIGRANTS. THEY ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. AND QUITE FRANKLY ARE REALLY STRUGGLING TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WITH THE RULES. THAT WE IMPOSE ON SMALL BUSINESSES. AND MANY OF THEM ARE GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE. AND SO THE MOMENT THAT AN EMPLOYEE UNDER THIS BILL SHOWS UP AND SAYS LOOK I GOT TO BE DONE I NEED TO LEAVE TOMORROW. I NEED I'M GONNA TAKE LEAVE. AND THAT EMPLOYER NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE RULES ARE SAYS HEY WAIT CAN YOU WAIT TILL FRIDAY. OR SO BUT YOU'RE FIRED I NEED YOU I'VE GOT SOMETHING COMING UP THAT I REALLY NEED YOU FOR I NEED TO I'M GONNA HAVE TO FILL THAT POSITION THEY'RE IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW. AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT USUALLY IN THE CONSTRUCT THAT WE HAVE DONE THESE FAMILY LEAVE BILLS. IS IT HAS BEEN. EIGHTY REFERRAL TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA. THAT THEY HAVE PROVIDED THIS LEGISLATURE THEY DO NOT HAVE A BACKLOG. OF CASES AND QUITE FRANKLY THEY RESOLVE CASES VERY QUICKLY AND THEY HAVE A MEDIATION UNIT SO THAT THEY CAN SIT DOWN AND WALK YOU THROUGH AND TELL SMALL BUSINESS EMPLOYERS HERE'S WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN BUT INSTEAD WHAT WE DID IN THIS BILL IS WE CREATED A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. WHICH MEANS YOU CAN HIRE YOUR OWN ATTORNEY YOU CAN SUE AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN OU'RE STARTING TO GET DAMAGES FROM THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT AND FRANKLY YOU'RE IN VIOLATION OF THE LACKEY SAY NO. OR IF YOU SAY HEY CAN YOU WORK ONE DAY A WEEK I NEED SOME HELP I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO REPLACE YOU SO THE CHALLENGE THAT I HAVE IS THIS IS FROM THE DAY THAT THIS BILL HIT. HIT OF MY COMMITTEE. AND FRANKLY IT'S THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. AS A BUDGET BILL AND THE PROCESS IS BEEN. VERY STRANGE BECAUSE NORMALLY THIS WOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH A POLICY COMMITTEES AND WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE STUFF IN A POLICY CONTEXT. IT HASN'T BEEN PROVIDED IT WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT BECAUSE NUMBER ONE THERE'S BEEN. AB RELUCTANCE TO NEGOTIATE SO THE ONE THE ONE AMENDMENT FRANKLY WAS TO GO FROM ONE EMPLOYEE TO FIVE DOESN'T MAKE ME HAPPY I'D RATHER HAVE IT. THE PERTAINED ALL OF THE EMPLOYEES THIS THIS IS A. A POLICY I WANT TO SUPPORT. BUT THE WAY THE BILL IS WRITTEN IS FLAWED AND WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO REALLY MAKE THE DIFFERENCE THE CORRECTIONS THAT NEED TO BE MADE. IN ORDER FOR IT TO ACTUALLY WORK FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AS WELL. AND SO. I REGRETTABLY STAND HERE. AND SAY ON BEHALF OF MY- ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES IN MY DISTRICT. BUT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS RIGHT. AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE EMPLOYEES ARE PROTECTED THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO TAKE THIS LEAVE THAT THEY HAVE THEIR JOB PROTECTED THAT THEY GET PAID THE MONEY THEY PAID INTO THE PROGRAM AND THAT SMALL BUSINESSES ARE PROTECTED IN THE WHOLE PROCESS AND IF WE CAN'T DO THAT I THINK WE OUGHT TO. PUT THIS ON THE SLOW TRACK. DEAL WITH THIS IS A POLICY BILL. TAKE OUR TIME. BRING IT BACK AND WORKING THROUGH THE PROCESS SO THAT WE CAN GET IT DONE BY AUGUST I RESPECTFULLY ASK A NO VOTE THANK YOU SIR CABALLERO SENATOR GONZALEZ. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE DIALOGUE THAT- BEEN HAD TODAY BY MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND REALLY FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT WHEN IT COMES TO LEAVE POLICIES HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE. AND I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T INCLUDE- SOME INFORMATION NOT ONLY ABOUT MYSELF BUT OF COURSE ABOUT OF THE FOSTER PARENTS THAT ARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA MANY OF WHICH WERE NOT ONLY MY FRIENDS BUT MANY ARE WHO ARE MY CONSTITUENTS THE FIRST. YOU KNOW COMING FROM A LARGE CORPORATION I WAS PERSONALLY GIVEN ABOUT FIVE YEARS AND AGO WHEN I HAD MY CHILD. TWENTY WEEKS OF PAID LEAVE. TWENTY WEEKS THAT COULD BE TAKEN. I DIDN'T HAVE TO BE TAKEN CONSECUTIVELY NOW I KNOW THAT WAS A LARGE CORPORATION THAT. A COULD BEAR THE BRUNT OF THESE LEAVE POLICIES BUT I THINK IT WAS A BIG TELLER. ESPECIALLY COMING FROM A HUGE TECH GIANT THAT SAID YES WE CARE. ABOUT OUR EMPLOYEES AND WE WANT TO SEE CHANGE WE WANT TO SEE THEM COME BACK- HAPPY WE WANT TO SEE THEM COME BACK WITH THEIR WELL BEING A PRIORITY. NEXT DAY I DIGRESS TO THE FOSTER PARENTS UP MANY OF OUR WHO ARE WHO ARE MY FRIENDS. AND WHO SAID TO ME THAT OFTENTIMES LIFE IS NOT TWELVE CONSECUTIVE WEEKS WITH FOSTERING. AS A NO YOU KNOW THEY GET A CALL FROM A HOSPITAL OR FOR CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES. AND IT'S YOU HAVE TO BE AT THE HOSPITAL IN ONE HOUR. AND MAYBE THEY'VE EXHAUSTED ALL OF THEIR LEAVE. AND WHAT DID THEY HAVE TO DO. EITHER HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO GO AND PICK UP THAT CHILD OR THEY HAVE TO DECIDE TO LOSE THEIR JOB IN MANY CASES. AND IN THE MIDST OF SUCH A PAINFUL AND VULNERABLE TIME CHILDREN WHO ENTER FOSTER CARE DESERVE THE TIME. TO PROCESS TO GRIEVE AND DEVELOP A SENSE OF SAFETY. THEY ALSO HAVE A REALLY- NEED TIME TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE TRANSITIONING INTO SOCIETY WITH THIS NEW HOME LIFE APPROPRIATELY. AND WITH THAT I CERTAINLY ASK. FOR CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR GONZALEZ CENTER CHECK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT UNFORTUNATELY I RISE IN OPPOSITION AND I JUST WANT TO SAY YOU KNOW MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT I SUPORT PAID FAMILY LEAVE I SUPPORTED- PAY FAMILY BENEFIT PAID FAMILY LEAVE BENEFIT EXPANSION AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK SENATE THE SENATOR FROM SANTA BARBARA BECAUSE I KNOW SHE'S BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR MANY YEARS AND I AM WITH HER. UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM- FROM SALINAS- IN TERMS OF THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION YOU KNOW I EVEN TURN MY OWN BILL OF REGARDING PAID FAMILY LEAVE SB NINE FORTY THREE WHICH WAS HELD A WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR PARENTS RECEIVE BENEFITS OF FROM PAID FAMILY LEAVE DUE TO HAVING TO CARE FOR CHILDDEPENDENT- OR DEPENDING WHO SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED AND- IN ADDRESSING OF THE SENATOR FROM CONTRA COSTA. YOU KNOW I WOULD BE THERE IF IT WAS A IF THIS IS THIS BILLS ADDRESSING OF THE COVERT SITUATION AND I OFF ALSO HEARD FROM MANY SMALL BUSINESSES AND PERMISSION TO READ. WITHOUT OBJECTION I HAVE A LETTER I JUST RECEIVED IT AND IT. SHE'S SHE'S A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER IN BREA. SAID I HAVE NEVER REACHED OUT FOR HELP FROM ANYONE BUT I AM AT RISK LOSING OF LOSING EVERYTHING DUE TO COVER NINETEEN. I MANUFACTURE CHILDREN'S KEEPS KEEPS A GIFT PRODUCT THAT I DESIGN AND SELL THEM VERY SUCCESSFULLY TO RETAIL MARKETS WHICH INCLUDES ALL OF THE SMALL MOM AND POP STORES TROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. THAT KEPT ME IN BUSINESS OVER THE PAST THIRTY THREE YEARS. DUE TO THE COUNTRY RETAIL. DUE TO THE COUNTRY RETAIL BUSINESS IS BEING SHUT DOWN I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO SURVIVE WE RECEIVED THE P. P. P. AND HAVE PAID ALL MY EMPLOYEES I HAVEN'T PAID THEM BEFORE PPP. MANY OF MY RETAIL ACCOUNTS HAVE SHUT DOWN MANY COULD NOT PAY THEIR OPEN INVOICES TO US ALL DO THE COVERT NINETEEN. I'M IF A WOMAN OWNED FAMILY BUSINESS THAT NEEDS SOME HELP TO SURVIVE. WE ALSO REQUIRED TO COMPLETE OUR LEASE AND WE'RE PLANNING ON DOWNSIZING BUT NEED TO RESOLVE THE CURRENT FINANCIAL BURDEN. I CURRENTLY HAVE MY HUSBAND. MY THREE SONS AND FIVE ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEES WORKING FOR ME AND DEPENDING ON NEED TO SURVIVE. I HAVE I HAVE RECEIVED MANY EMAILS AND MANY PHONE CALLS. FROM SIMILAR SMALL BUSINESSES. I AM IMPLORING US TO SIT DOWN AND LET'S DO THIS RIGHT BECAUSE I'M A HUGE SUPPORTER OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE. AND I WANT TO VOTE FOR SOMETHING. LIKE THIS BUT UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T GET THERE TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER CHIANG CENTER BORDERS. TODAY'S DEBATE HAS BEEN. VERY INSIGHTFUL I APPRECIATED I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS TO A MINIMUM I'M IMPRESSED BY COMMONSENSE HEARD FROM LOYAL DEMOCRATS. WHO HAVE TAKEN A- STRONG STAND ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT WITH MORE DEBATE MORE ON DISCUSSION. ESPECIALLY THE PERTAINS TO- PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THIS COULD BE DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED UPON. BUT GIVEN THE OF THE PROCESSES THAT IT'S GONE THROUGH THE SHORT CUTS THAT WERE MADE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE A PRODUCT. THAT IS NOT. RIGHT FOR A STABILITY PLAN TODAY IN OTHER WORDS IT'S AT THIS POINT IN TIME IS NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME. SO I WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE FOLKS. THAT IN THE AUTHOR. ON TO REVISIT SOME OF THESE COMPELLING ISSUES I THINK THERE ARE WAYS TO MAKE THIS BETTER FROM- THE VIEWPOINT ACROSS THE AISLE AND I THINK WOULD IMPROVE UPON THE PRODUCT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THIS MATTER BE BROUGHT BACK AT A LATER POINT TIME. THANK YOU CENTER FOR JUST A SENATOR NIELSEN. MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN OF THE SENATE I WAS NOT INTENDING TO RISE ON THE BILL. AND I'M RISING ON THE BILL BUT MORE I'M RISING SUPPORTING A COLLEAGUE. THE LIVE SHARED A COMMON EXPERIENCE. WE HAS LEGISLATORS HAVE MANY THINGS TO BALANCE OUR OWN CONVICTION AND FUNDAMENTAL BELIEFS WHICH I'VE ALWAYS ARGUED SHOULD BE PREEMINENT. WE HAVE THE PARTY THAT WE ARE A MEMBER OF TO BE RESPECTFUL AND HELPFUL TO. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE HAVE THE PEOPLE. THAT WE REPRESENT. NOW WE OF COURSE CANNOT REPRESENT EVERYBODY ON ALL ISSUES. WE DO THE VERY BEST WE CN. TO BE CONSISTENT. WHEN  FIRST RAN THE DISTRICT TO DIE. INSPIRED TO WAS 60% DEMOCRAT 30% REPUBLICAN. NOT REALLY VERY GOOD ODDS. BUT IT WORKED OUT AND I FOUND OUT. THAT I COULD BE TRUE TO MY CONVICTIONS. NOT A TRAIT THE PARTY. AND REPRESENTS A STRONG MAJORITY DEMOCRATIC DISTRICT. AND KEY TO THAT WAS BEING ATTENTIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THE CONSTRUCTION WHICH WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE DO IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ALL THE PHILOSOPHIC THINGS OR PARTY THINGS WE ASPIRE TO AN- OUT HERE. WELL THEN WE HAD A REAPPORTIONMENT COME ALONG. AND THEN IT BECAME A BIT MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE DISTRICT BECAME A BIT MORE REPUBLICAN THEN I THINK THE HIGHEST EVER GOT WAS 34% BUT THERE WERE MORE REPUBLICANS. AND UNLIKE THE MEMBER WHO I'M REFERRING TO FROM SALINAS. SHE REPRESENTS VALLEY COUNTIES. AND COASTAL COUNTIES. I HAD A SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCE BECAUSE IN THE SECOND REAPPORTIONMENT PICKED UP A LOT OF THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY COUNTIES WHICH WERE VERY DIFFERENT. THEN SOME OF THE FORMER COUNTIES. SO IT WAS A MORE CHALLENGING. TIME BUT I DIDN'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THAT. I CAN BY AND WORK WITH% THE MEMBERS AND THE CITIZENS OF THE DISTRICT NAY YET INTEREST THAT WE HAD THERE IN THOSE DISTRICTS THAT WERE COMMON. AND TRIED TO BE ATTENTIVE TO THEM. AND IT WORKED OUT FOR ME. WELL. I SEE THE PRESSURE THE CHEESE AND DURING. NOT TO BE UNEXPECTED. BUT WHAT I WOULD MOST ASSUREDLY ADD THERE OUGHT TO BE NO RETALIATION FROM ANY SOURCE FOR A MEMBER. WHO SUPPORTS THE DISTRICT THEY REPRESENT. AND DOES THE VERY BEST TO DO THAT KNOWING THAT SOME IN THAT DISTRICT WILL NOT LIKE WHAT THEY DO. BUT I SHOULD LET FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. THOUGH THEY MAY NOT LIKE IT. THEY WILL STILL RESPECT. AN ELECTRICIAN ONE BIT FURTHER WITH A BIT OF A HUMOROUS ADDITION. ONE OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT I FIRST REPRESENTED WAS DAVIS. I WON THE DISTRICT BY 54% BUT LOST IN DAVIS. BY TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED VOTES I BELIEVE. NEXT TIME AROUND. I WON THE DISTRICT LIFE KERRY DAVIS. BUT ONLY LOST BY FIVE HUNDRED VOTES. WELL THE PRESIDENT IS A BIG DEAL SO THEY COME IN THEY SAID WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT SET NIELSEN- YOU'RE THE ONLY LOST BY FIVE HUNDRED AND DAVIS. I SAID YEAH I'M AFRAID I'M I'M GETTING OUT OF TUNE WITH THE DISTRICT I'M GOING TO WORK REALLY HARD THE NEXT FOUR YEARS THE LOSE BY A GREATER MARGIN AND DAVIS. NEXT TIME. NOW THAT SPOKEN FUN AT IT. BUT IT WOULDN'T BEEN INDIFFERENCE HAD I STAYED REPRESENTING DAVIS YOU ATTEND TO THE- POPULATION. THE END AND THAT'S WHAT MADE A DIFFERENCE TO ME THAT THAN QUANTIFIES HOW ONE CAN SUCCESSFULLY BALANCE. FROM VERY DIFFERENT INTEREST IN THE DISTRICT THAT THEY REPRESENT. AND FURTHER WHY IT IS IMPORTANT FOR A MEMBER TO DO THAT. AND THAT NUMBER IS COMMENDABLY BALANCING THOSE CONCERNS AND THAT ARGUES I THINK TO A NO VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN MEMBER SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. CENTER JACKSON YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I REALLY O APPRECIATE THIS ROBUST AND HARDY DEBATE I AM TOTALLY CONVINCED THAT MY SEVEN AND FOUR YEAR OLD GRAND CHILDREN HAVE LOST INTEREST THOUGH IN THIS DISCUSSION. GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE HAVE SPENT ON IT- BUT I DO THINK IT'S A WORTHY DISCUSSION AND I WANT TO APPRECIATE. THOSE IN SUPPORT AS WELL AS THOSE. WHO ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL I DO THINK THIS IS A QUESTION OF WHAT OUR PRIORITIES MORE. AND THAT'S WHY I AM IN EARNEST IN STRONG SUPPORT AND HOPE THAT ULTIMATELY. YOU WILL ALSO A VOTE FOR THIS BILL AS WELL WHAT I WANT TO DO IS TO ADDRESS. SOME OF THEM MISUNDERSTANDING. THAT EXISTS FIRST OF ALL THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT REQUIRES FURTHER. ANALYSIS THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN AN HOUR ANALYZE FOR YEARS FOR DECADES. THE STUDIES THAT FORM THE BASIS UPON WHICH THE GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCE SUGGESTED THIS LEGISLATION HAVE GONE ON FOR YEARS. THERE ARE AT LEAST FOUR FIVE THAT I'VE READ THAT WERE WRITTEN IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THE DEAL WITH AND GO BACK TO EARLIER THE SKY. AND EARLIER RESEARCH THAT WAS DONE THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN RESEARCHED TO THE MAXIMUM. IT SHOWS THAT GIVING NEW PARENT LEAVE IS GOOD FOR THE FOR THE INFANT IS GOOD FOR THE MOTHER. REDUCING POST PARTUM DEPRESSION BY THIRD AND GOOD FOR A NEW DAD. AND WE'RE SEEING MORE MORE DADS TAKING THIS LEAVE. SO THE RESEARCHERS THERE. THIS LEGISLATION AGAIN HAS TAKEN A LOOK AT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T ACCESS IT IN THE ROOM THE REASON IS BECAUSE THERE'S NO ASSURANCE THAT GOT THE JOB. AND THIS ESSENTIALLY PUTS THE CAP ON BACK CONSERVE. IT ADDRESSES IT IT'S A TWO FOLD THE ISSUE. THE ABILITY TO TAKE LEAVE THE TO PAY FOR. AND BE SURE YOU GET YOUR JOB WHEN YOU COME BACK. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS. THIS ISN'T ABOUT AB FIVE BECAUSE TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR ISSUE. AB FIVE IS NOT AN ISSUE. AND LIKE MANY OF YOU I'VE ACTUALLY HAD A SMALL BUSINESS TO. AND I HAVE STORIES OF MY STAFF NEEDING TO GO OUT ON LEAVE. THEY DON'T JUST CALL UP AND SAY I'VE GOT TO TAKE TWELVE WEEKS OFF. THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS UNDER THIS LEGISLATION. THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS. THAT IF YOU. HAVE AN EMERGENCY. THEN YOU CAN TAKE THAT EMERGENCY TIME OFF BUT OTHERWISE YOU HAVE TO GIVE AT LEAST THIRTY DAYS NOTICE LET ME MAKE SURE I HAVE THIS CORRECT. YOU HAVE TO GIVE AT LEAST THIRTY DAYS NOTICE- IF BELIEVE IS PREDICTABLE. SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE LEE BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A BABY. NOW MOST PEOPLE WILL TELL THEIR EMPLOYERS WHEN THEY FIND OUT. THIS IS A JOYFUL MOMENT FOR MOST PEOPLE. AND THEY ARE GOING TO SHARE WITH THEIR EMPLOYER HEY LOOK. I AM GOING TO HAVE A BABY ON TWO X. POINT AND I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE MY LEAVE AT THAT POINT IN TIME. NOW ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO REMEMBER TO BY THE WAY. IS THAT A GOOD PORTION OF THIS LEAVE IS UNPAID. SO PEOPLE ARE JUST GOING TO RUN OUT AND START TAKING LEAVE. THEY DON'T GET PAID WHEN THEY TAKE THAT LEAVES. THEY CAN GET PARTIAL JOB REPLACEMENT FROM THEIR OWN MONEY FROM THEIR SAVINGS ACCOUNT BUT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME WORKERS THAT ISN'T ENOUGH TO MAKE THEIR ENDS MEET PEOPLE TAKE THIS LEAVE BECAUSE THEY NEED TO TAKE A SWING. THEY TAKE THIS LEAVE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER. IT WAS MENTIONED BY MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO TAKE HER MOTHER FOR CANCER TREATMENTS. ARE THOSE TREATMENTS OF COURSE ARE USUALLY SCHEDULED IN ADVANCE AND IF YOU NEED TO TAKE A FRIDAY OFF EVERY OTHER WEEK. FOR TO TAKE A PARENT FOR CANCER TREATMENT OR IF YOU NEED YOUR OWN CANCER TREATMENT. AS SOME OF US IN THIS ROOM HAVE HAD. YOU KNOW WHEN THOSE TREATMENTS OR AND YOU DESPERATELY NEED TO TAKE THAT TIME OFF FROM WORK IN PART FRANKLY BECAUSE YOU'RE TREATING YOUR EMPLOYER IF YOU GO BACK TO WORK WHEN YOU'RE FEELING CRAPPY. LET'S FACE IT ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM EITHER OURSELVES OR OUR LOVED ONES HAVE HAD THOSE MOMENTS WHERE WE NEED TO BE THERE FOR THEM. AND IF YOU AREN'T THERE FOR THEM. YOU WILL HAVE MISSED OUT ON BOTH THE JOY AND THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF CARING FOR THE PEOPLE THAT YOU LOVE. SO THE NOTION THAT AN EMPLOYER. SHOULD BE ABLE TO TELL YOU. WHEN YOU CAN TAKE THAT LEAVE. IS A QUESTION YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF. YOU DON'T JUST TAKE LEAVE BECAUSE SHE WANTED THE LAW REQUIRES THAT YOU'RE TAKING IT FOR A MAJOR MEDICAL REASON YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT. OR WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BOND WITH THE NEWBORN AS A MOTHER OR A FATHER. AN INCH TODAY'S WORLD WE KNOW THAT OUR PEOPLE ARE NOT ABLE TO BE IN THE WORK FORCE THEIR FAMILY SUFFER. AND WE DO KNOW. AND THE RESEARCH IS CLEAR THAT THERE IS A BENEFIT TO SMALL BUSINESSES. TO BE ABLE TO GIVE. THEIR EMPLOYEES THE TIME OFF AND BRING THEM BACK WITHOUT HAVING TO GET NEW EMPLOYEES THE COST OF RETENTION OR EXCUSE ME THE COST OF RETRAINING. THE COST OF GOING OUT AND TRYING TO FIND NEW PEOPLE. IS STEPS. TO THESE COME IN THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE COME. EITHER SMALL COME AND THEY'RE BEEN STUDIES DONE OF THIS AND I APPRECIATE THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE TALKED TO SOME OF THEIR WORK OUR SMALL BUSINESSES. BUT IF THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES WILL TELL YOU THAT ACTUALLY THEY WERE ABLE TO SAVE MONEY. AND THAT THEIR WORKERS COME BACK THERE MORE EFFECTIVE THE MORE EFFICIENT THEY'RE MORE LOYAL THEY STAY LONGER IN THE JOB THOSE ARE THE FACTS. WE KNOW THAT. SO I WANT TO GET TO THE ISSUE OF A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. THERE'S ALWAYS A SEEMS TO BE A STICKING POINT FOR SOME OFMY COLLEAGUES IN MY A GOOD COLLEAGUE. WHO ASKED ME TO DIRECT MY ATTENTION TO THAT IN MY CLOTHES SO I HOPE THAT SHE IS. LISTENING BECAUSE I WANT TO ADDRESS THIS. A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION HAS BEEN IN THE LAW SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. WITH THE ARE APPARENT DISABILITY MATERNITY DISABILITY LEAVE HAS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. SO THIS IS NOT NEW TO EMPLOYERS BUT WHAT IS THAT ME. UNDER THE LAW AND UNDER THIS FLOOR HERE IT MEANS THAT IF YOU FEEL THAT YOUR RIGHT TO TAKE THAT LEAVE HAS BEEN VIOLATED YOU HAVE TO FILE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. THEY GO THROUGH AN INVESTIGATION. THEY ALSO OFFER MEDIATION. SO IF YOU ARE IN MEDIATION YOUR SMALL EMPLOYER YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD TO DO THIS YOU WERE IN MEDIATION AND YOU SAY OH MY GOODNESS I'VE GOT TO GIVE YOU YOUR JOB BACK HERE IS YOUR JOB BACK THEN THE EMPLOYEE HAS NO DAMAGES. SO EFFECTIVELY THE SITUATION HAS BEEN RESOLVED. HOW FREQUENTLY USE THIS USED VERY VERY RARELY. BECAUSE EMPLOYEES DON'T WANT TO SUE YOU THEY JUST WANT TO TAKE THE TIME OFF THE BOND WITH A NEWBORN OR TO TAKE CARE OF A PARENT OR A CHILD. THREE ME. I MEAN I THINK WE ALL HAVE THOSE STORIES AND TO SAY THAT EMPLOYERS GIVE YOU THAT RIGHT WELL IF THAT WERE THE CASE WE WOULDN'T BE HERE BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU AND ALL THE YEARS I'VE BEEN DOING THIS WORK AND THE DOZENS IF NOT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME BEFORE COMMITTEES ARE TO TESTIFY. THE ANGUISH OF THEIR INABILITY TO TAKE THE LEAVE I REMEMBER WE HAD A FIRE FIGHTER WHO HAD BEEN A CAPTAIN AND HE BECAME THE SOLE SUPPORT AND THE SHOW PROVIDER FOR HIS THREE YOUNG SONS. AND HE HAD TO WORK HIS SCHEDULE AROUND THE HIS CHILDREN. AND HE WAS FIRED BECAUSE OF THAT. HE WAS ONE OF MY WITNESSES WHO CAME IN A DAD WHO JUST WANTED TO BE ABLE TO WORK SO THAT HE COULD CARE FOR HIS CHILDREN AS WELL. AND I THINK AS WE- BORROWED DOWN INTO THIS. WE HAVE TO BE COGNIZANT OF THE FACT. IN THIS WORLD TODAY IN ALL OF THE INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES. COMPANIES GOVERNMENT'S POLICY. ALLOWS PEOPLE TO BE BOTH. AN EMPLOYEE AND A HUMAN BEING AND THAT IS WHAT I AM ASKING YOU TO VOTE FOR TODAY AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIFLE THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON MA'AM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
