LOOKING THROUGH YEARS OF

00:42:23.173 --> 00:42:24.174
RESEARCH WE HAD ABOUT A DECADE

00:42:24.241 --> 00:42:26.277
OF OF DATA THROUGH RESEARCH THAT

00:42:26.343 --> 00:42:27.611

POPULATION THAT WE SERVE AND

00:42:34.518 --> 00:42:35.886
THEN WE DID AS A SEVERAL MONTH

00:42:35.953 --> 00:42:38.489
STUDY OF NEW ADMISSIONS TO TALK

OVERALL THE DATA DIDN'T REFLECT

00:42:44.094 --> 00:42:45.195
ANY MAJOR CHANGES IN THE

WE ALSO AND THE MAJORITY OF I

00:43:06.183 --> 00:43:08.319

APPROXIMATELY 47% THIS IS

00:43:15.993 --> 00:43:17.328
ANOTHER STATISTIC THAT WE GOING

00:43:17.394 --> 00:43:19.763
FROM OUR MORE RECENT --

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:21.365
A REVIEW OF THE AYE AYE IS HE

AND THEN --

00:43:29.773 --> 00:43:31.241
WE ALSO COMPARED R. I. S. T.

00:43:31.308 --> 00:43:34.144
DATA TO MEDICAL DATA AND 2407%

00:43:34.211 --> 00:43:35.045
OF THE I GUESS HE'S HAD NOT

00:43:35.112 --> 00:43:36.213

COUNTIES THAT WERE INTERESTED IN --

00:45:19.283 --> 00:45:22.553
APPLYING FOR THESE FUNDS SO OUR

00:45:22.619 --> 00:45:24.188

00:45:45.476 --> 00:45:47.511
SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR

00:45:47.578 --> 00:45:50.280

WITH THE HOPE OF REVERSING THAT

00:46:03.861 --> 00:46:05.529
CYCLE OF OF CRIMINALIZATION AND

00:46:05.596 --> 00:46:09.266

AND SO ARE OUR EFFORTS TO DATE

00:46:12.536 --> 00:46:14.037
HAVE REALLY BEEN FOCUSED AROUND

00:46:14.104 --> 00:46:15.472
SORT OF THREE MAIN DOMAINS.

00:46:15.539 --> 00:46:17.074
AND THAT IS THE CONTRACT AND

00:46:17.141 --> 00:46:18.509
FUNDING PROCESS.

00:46:18.575 --> 00:46:20.077
HOW QUICKLY CAN WE GET THESE

00:46:20.144 --> 00:46:23.113
THIS MONEY OUT TO THE COUNTY IS --

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:26.984

MONEY OUT THE DOOR.

00:46:37.461 --> 00:46:39.763
AND THEN LASTLY TO STRATEGIZE

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:40.831
AROUND THE DATA COLLECTION

00:46:40.898 --> 00:46:42.266

FRONT --

00:46:46.203 --> 00:46:47.171
BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF OUR

00:46:47.237 --> 00:46:48.705

MEDI CAL APPROPRIATE SERVICES

LEVERAGED AS WELL --

00:56:09.265 --> 00:56:10.366
SO DEFINITELY THE COUNTIES ARE

00:56:10.433 --> 00:56:12.135
BEING CREATIVE AND ARE UTILIZING

00:56:12.202 --> 00:56:14.170
THOSE MHSAA DOLLARS I THINK ONE

00:56:14.237 --> 00:56:16.206
OF THE CHALLENGES MIGHT BE MORE

00:56:16.272 --> 00:56:18.341
AROUND HAVING THOSE IMAGES STATE

00:56:18.408 --> 00:56:20.343
PLANS THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:22.712
AND THEN AND GETTING ACCESS TO

00:56:22.779 --> 00:56:24.214
THOSE FUNDS --

00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.583
WHERE THAT PLAN --

00:56:26.649 --> 00:56:27.951
HAS ALREADY BEEN IN PLACE BUT

00:56:28.017 --> 00:56:29.419
WE'RE WE'RE WE ARE --

00:56:29.486 --> 00:56:30.620

00:56:30.687 --> 00:56:33.289
SEE AROUND THAT --

00:56:33.356 --> 00:56:37.660

00:56:37.727 --> 00:56:38.194
THE USE OF THOSE IMAGES A

00:56:38.261 --> 00:56:39.529
DOLLARS.

00:56:39.596 --> 00:56:40.163
HEY PHILIP LEVERAGING BUT WHEN

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:42.465
THEY'RE SITTING ON LARGE AMOUNTS

00:56:42.532 --> 00:56:43.833
OF MONEY.

00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:46.970
THEY CALL RESERVE FUNDS --

00:56:47.036 --> 00:56:47.604

ARE THE INTENDED PURPOSE FORM.

00:56:53.343 --> 00:56:54.310
I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE

00:56:54.377 --> 00:56:56.246
TO BE VERY CAREFUL AND MAKE SURE

00:56:56.312 --> 00:56:57.981
THEY'RE NOT USING YOUR DOLLARS.

00:56:58.047 --> 00:56:58.581
SO THEY CAN HOLD ON TO THEIR

00:56:58.648 --> 00:57:01.751

00:57:01.818 --> 00:57:03.887

01:07:01.417 --> 01:07:03.686
PLAN TO PILOT THIS PROPOSAL

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:04.487
BECAUSE WE ACKNOWLEDGE THERE'S

01:07:04.553 --> 01:07:06.188
SOME UNCERTAINTY OF AS TO

01:07:06.255 --> 01:07:07.523

STAFF WE IT THIS THIS PART OF

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:22.405
THE PROPOSAL CAN KIND OF BE

01:07:22.471 --> 01:07:22.972
THOUGHT OF IN TWO DIFFERENT

01:07:23.038 --> 01:07:24.039
PIECES --

01:07:24.106 --> 01:07:26.041
FIRST OF ALL THERE IS A PIECE

01:07:26.108 --> 01:07:27.543
WHERE THE DEPARTMENT IS SEEKING

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:29.078
TO AUGMENT THE NUMBER OF STAFF

01:07:29.145 --> 01:07:31.280
THAT THEY CURRENTLY USE IN ORDER

01:07:31.347 --> 01:07:32.615
TO COMPLETE THIS WORKLOAD.

01:07:32.681 --> 01:07:33.916
WE FELT THAT THE DEPARTMENT

01:07:33.983 --> 01:07:35.217
DIDN'T PROVIDE ADEQUATE

01:07:35.284 --> 01:07:36.786
JUSTIFICATION SHOWING THAT THEIR

01:07:36.852 --> 01:07:38.387
EXISTING STAFFING LEVELS ARE

01:07:38.454 --> 01:07:39.488
INSUFFICIENT.

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:40.589
SO WE'RE NOT RECOMMENDING

01:07:40.656 --> 01:07:42.458
APPROVING THAT SECONDLY THERE

01:07:42.525 --> 01:07:44.059
WERE SOME ADMINISTRATIVE STUFF

01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:45.694
THAT WERE BEING REQUESTED TO

01:07:45.761 --> 01:07:48.230
REFINE THAT THE STAFFING

01:07:48.297 --> 01:07:49.098
STANDARDS THAT THEY'RE

01:07:49.165 --> 01:07:50.399
ESTABLISHING FOR THE FORENSIC

01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:51.767
VALUE WAITERS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

01:07:51.834 --> 01:07:52.668
RECOMMENDING.

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:54.503
APPROVING THOSE POSITIONS WERE

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:56.172
ALSO NOT RECOMMENDING --

01:07:56.238 --> 01:07:57.873
APPROVING THESE CORRESPONDING

01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:59.642
ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF.

01:07:59.708 --> 01:08:01.210
NOW WITH RESPECT TO THE NEURO

01:08:01.277 --> 01:08:03.179
PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATIONS WE DO

01:08:03.245 --> 01:08:04.980
THINK THAT THESE EVALUATIONS

01:08:05.047 --> 01:08:06.816
COULD BE AN EFFECTIVE WAY OF

01:08:06.882 --> 01:08:08.451
IDENTIFYING PATIENTS THAT ARE AT

01:08:08.517 --> 01:08:09.852
RISK OF VIOLENCE.

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:11.754
AND MORE EFFECTIVELY TREATING

01:08:11.821 --> 01:08:13.155
OTHER PATIENTS SO WE ARE

01:08:13.222 --> 01:08:14.957
RECOMMENDING THAT THOSE

01:08:15.024 --> 01:08:16.659
RESOURCES BE APPROVED --

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:17.693

COGNITIVE REMEDIATION PILOT WE

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:21.163
ALSO THINK THAT THIS IS A

01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:22.631
POTENTIALLY PROMISING APPROACH.

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:24.133
THE WE ARE CONCERNED THAT

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:28.471
DESPITE SOURCES ARE OPPOSED.

BASED REVIEW PROJECT --

01:09:11.413 --> 01:09:12.248
AT THE MISSION BASED REVIEW

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:14.350
PROJECT THE GOAL IS TO REALLY

01:09:14.416 --> 01:09:15.951
LOOK AT THE RESOURCES THAT ARE

01:09:16.018 --> 01:09:17.887
NECESSARY TO PROVIDE SERVICES

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:19.088
THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES.

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:20.489
YOU REALLY LOOK AT I'M

01:09:20.556 --> 01:09:25.261
INNOVATIVE WAYS OF AND OF

01:09:25.327 --> 01:09:27.563
LOOKING AT THINGS FROM A FROM

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:29.064
STANDPOINT --

01:09:29.131 --> 01:09:31.500
YOU KNOW TO KIND OF ENSURE THAT

01:09:31.567 --> 01:09:33.502
THE THE SERVICES THAT ARE BEING

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:35.004
PROVIDED ARE THE ONES THAT ARE

01:09:35.070 --> 01:09:36.605
FUNDAMENTAL TO THE DEPARTMENT'S

01:09:36.672 --> 01:09:38.240
MISSION AND THAT ANYTHING THAT.

01:09:38.307 --> 01:09:39.775
WOULD BE EXTRANEOUS WOULD BE YOU

01:09:39.842 --> 01:09:40.576
KNOW KIND OF LOOKED AT ON A

01:09:40.643 --> 01:09:41.911
PRIORITIZE BASIS TO MAKE SURE

01:09:41.977 --> 01:09:43.445
WE'RE MAKING USE OF OUR LIMITED

01:09:43.512 --> 01:09:44.513
RESOURCES.

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:46.415
AND WE HAVE SPENT QUITE A BIT OF

01:09:46.482 --> 01:09:47.983
TIME LOOKING AT THE STUFFING

01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:49.685
STUDY --

01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:52.555
THAT AT STATE HOSPITALS AND PUT

01:09:52.621 --> 01:09:54.857
TOGETHER MANY MANY HOURS I'M

01:09:54.924 --> 01:09:56.525
MANY OF THE OF THE QUESTIONS OF

01:09:56.592 --> 01:09:57.826
THE LA I WAS ASKING I THINK WE

01:09:57.893 --> 01:09:59.128
YOU KNOW WE INITIALLY AUST AS

01:09:59.194 --> 01:10:00.029
WELL.

01:10:00.095 --> 01:10:01.430
AND BEING NEW TO THIS --

01:10:01.497 --> 01:10:03.699
INDUSTRY AND I THINK WE

01:10:03.766 --> 01:10:04.967
ABSOLUTELY CAME AWAY FROM THE

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:08.704
PROCESS FEELING LIKE TIME. ONE

01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:09.772
OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THE

01:10:09.838 --> 01:10:11.774
CLINICAL STAFF EXPERIENCE IT --

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.008
RIGHT NOW IS THAT THEY ARE

01:10:13.075 --> 01:10:15.044
CALLED AWAY TO TESTIFY IN COURT

01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:16.979
SO WHETHER THEY ARE WHETHER THIS

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:18.514
IS FOR THEIR OWN PATIENT OR FOR

01:10:18.581 --> 01:10:19.481
PEER -- AS

01:10:19.548 --> 01:10:20.783
THE LA WAS PROPOSING IT WOULD

01:10:20.849 --> 01:10:22.117
STILL REMOVE THAT CLINICIAN FROM

01:10:22.184 --> 01:10:23.385
THE FACILITY WHICH MEANS THAT

01:10:23.452 --> 01:10:24.553
THEY'RE NOT SEEING PATIENTS.

01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:25.721
THEY'RE NOT THERE ON A DAY TO

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:27.156
DAY BASIS TO OBSERVE WHATEVER I

01:10:27.222 --> 01:10:28.257
MIGHT BE GOING ON WITH THE

01:10:28.324 --> 01:10:29.758
PATIENTS THAT.

01:10:29.825 --> 01:10:30.759
YOU KNOW IF THEY COULD INTERVENE

01:10:30.826 --> 01:10:32.795
IN A IN A TIMELY MANNER MAYBE

01:10:32.861 --> 01:10:34.396
COULD BE --

01:10:34.463 --> 01:10:37.967
MEDIATED NOT THERE AND THEY

01:10:38.033 --> 01:10:39.401
DON'T HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO

01:10:39.468 --> 01:10:40.469
DO THAT SO.

01:10:40.536 --> 01:10:42.438
I'M WHAT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT

01:10:42.504 --> 01:10:44.206
WE WERE RECOMMENDING --

01:10:44.273 --> 01:10:47.076
AT SEPARATE TO CLINICIAN WAS AND

01:10:47.142 --> 01:10:48.410
IN ORDER TO KEEP THE TREATING

01:10:48.477 --> 01:10:49.945
CLINICIANS ON THE UNIT AND

01:10:50.012 --> 01:10:51.847
PRESENT FOR THE TIME FOR THE

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:54.049
PATIENTS --

01:10:54.116 --> 01:10:56.218
IN ADDITION --

01:10:56.285 --> 01:10:58.354
WE ARE RECOMMENDING SENIOR

01:10:58.420 --> 01:10:59.555
PSYCHOLOGIST --

01:10:59.622 --> 01:11:00.456
THE SENIOR PSYCHOLOGIST

01:11:00.522 --> 01:11:02.291
SPECIALIST SEES ME WHICH IS A

01:11:02.358 --> 01:11:03.993
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT --

01:11:04.059 --> 01:11:05.160
DISCIPLINE THEN THAT THE

01:11:05.227 --> 01:11:06.695
PSYCHIATRIST THAT ARE CURRENTLY

01:11:06.762 --> 01:11:08.297
BEING CALLED AWAY BECAUSE

01:11:08.364 --> 01:11:08.797
THEY'RE THE LEAD OF THE

01:11:08.864 --> 01:11:09.331
TREATMENT TEAM.

01:11:09.398 --> 01:11:10.933
OBVIOUSLY STOP ENOUGH I'M

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.768
MISSTATING ANYTHING HERE --

01:11:12.835 --> 01:11:14.370
AND SO USING OF THE LA OWES

01:11:14.436 --> 01:11:15.838
MODEL WE WE BELIEVE WOULD

01:11:15.904 --> 01:11:17.773
ACTUALLY POTENTIALLY RESULT IN

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:18.974
ADDITIONAL COSTS BECAUSE YOU

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:20.242
WOULD NEED TO CONTINUE TO USE

01:11:20.309 --> 01:11:21.644
THE PSYCHIATRISTS TO DO.

01:11:21.710 --> 01:11:22.945
WORK THAT ACTUALLY THE THE

01:11:23.012 --> 01:11:25.614
PSYCHOLOGIST AND IS IS ABLE TO

01:11:25.681 --> 01:11:26.849
DO -- A

01:11:26.915 --> 01:11:28.584
FINALLY ONE OF ONE OF THE OTHER

01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:30.653
COMPELLING REASONS I'M IS THAT

01:11:30.719 --> 01:11:32.187
THIS IS THIS --

01:11:32.254 --> 01:11:34.123
WE CAME TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE

01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:35.891
FORENSIC WORK THE STATE TO BE

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:37.126
DONE IS REALLY MORE OF A NICHE

01:11:37.192 --> 01:11:39.094
AREA OF PSYCHOLOGY AND

01:11:39.161 --> 01:11:39.762
PSYCHIATRY THIS ROUTE THAT

01:11:39.828 --> 01:11:43.399
REQUIRES --

01:11:43.465 --> 01:11:45.734
ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND REALLY

01:11:45.801 --> 01:11:47.202
OWN THAT LAYS STANDPOINT IT'S

01:11:47.269 --> 01:11:48.570
ALMOST LIKE A DIFFERENT

01:11:48.637 --> 01:11:49.972
ENGINEERING DISCIPLINES RIGHT

01:11:50.039 --> 01:11:51.173
YOU HAVE THE VARIOUS YOU KNOW

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.175
ENGINE OR ELECTRICAL STRUCTURAL.

01:11:53.242 --> 01:11:54.443
THEY REALLY DO HAVE A SPECIALTY

01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:55.811
AREA AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S

01:11:55.878 --> 01:11:57.279
KIND OF A A GOOD LATE --

01:11:57.346 --> 01:11:59.081
COMPARISON TO MAKE HERE I WAS

01:11:59.148 --> 01:12:00.816
OBVIOUSLY MUCH MORE COMPLEX AND

01:12:00.883 --> 01:12:03.485
THEN I COULD GOING TO FOR SURE --

01:12:03.552 --> 01:12:04.720
AND SO IT REALLY HAVING THE

01:12:04.787 --> 01:12:06.455
RIGHT PERSON TO DO THE JOB --

01:12:06.522 --> 01:12:08.424
I THINK IS IS CRITICAL HERE AND

01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:09.858
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE --

01:12:09.925 --> 01:12:11.160
THAT THEY HAVE THE TRAINING AND

01:12:11.226 --> 01:12:12.361
EXPERTISE --

01:12:12.428 --> 01:12:14.396
AND THAT WERE NOT SIMPLY CROSS

01:12:14.463 --> 01:12:15.831
TRAINING A MORE GENERALISED

01:12:15.898 --> 01:12:18.033
CLASS TO DO THE WORK OF OF A

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:20.469
SPECIALIST --

01:12:20.536 --> 01:12:21.937
AND SO I THAT THAT'S ON THE

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:24.873
ISSUE OF OF THE THE PEER REVIEW --

01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:28.310
IN TERMS OF THE CASE MANAGEMENT

01:12:28.377 --> 01:12:30.145
STAFF AND WE REALLY --

01:12:30.212 --> 01:12:33.115
LOOKED AT THIS ISSUE ALSO --

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:34.583
FOR QUITE A LENGTH OF TIME AND

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:35.718
WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT THAT

01:12:35.784 --> 01:12:37.920
EACH FACILITY IS FULLY MANAGING

01:12:37.986 --> 01:12:39.455
THEIR DIFFERENCE A CASE

01:12:39.521 --> 01:12:43.425
MANAGEMENT DIFFERENTLY AND BY

01:12:43.492 --> 01:12:44.059
FOR IN THAT CASE MANAGEMENT WHAT

01:12:44.126 --> 01:12:47.463
WE MEAN THAT THEY WERE PLEADED

01:12:47.529 --> 01:12:49.298
IN A SIMILAR FASHION IN A TIMELY

01:12:49.364 --> 01:12:49.932
FASHION.

01:12:49.998 --> 01:12:51.100
THAT THE COURTS GETTING ALL THE

01:12:51.166 --> 01:12:52.601
INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED AND

01:12:52.668 --> 01:12:54.837
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OVER

01:12:54.903 --> 01:12:55.838
ELEVEN THOUSAND RIGHT AROUND

01:12:55.904 --> 01:12:56.805
ELEVEN THOUSAND REPORTS ANNUALLY

01:12:56.872 --> 01:12:58.974
THAT'S A LOT OF OF MANAGEMENT

01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:00.576
THE NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE.

01:13:00.642 --> 01:13:02.444
AND SO WHAT WE WERE HOPING --

01:13:02.511 --> 01:13:04.246
WITH PROVIDING ADDITIONAL

01:13:04.313 --> 01:13:05.814
RESOURCES IS IT REALLY THE

01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:08.150
ABILITY TO ESTABLISH BEST

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:09.518
PRACTICES --

01:13:09.585 --> 01:13:11.019
AMONGST THE FACILITIES AND BE

01:13:11.086 --> 01:13:12.121
ABLE TO KIND OF SHARE LESSONS

01:13:12.187 --> 01:13:14.790
LEARNED BETWEEN THEM --

01:13:14.857 --> 01:13:16.625
AND ADDITIONALLY KIND OF PROVING

01:13:16.692 --> 01:13:17.960
THAT LINE OF COMMUNICATION WITH

01:13:18.026 --> 01:13:18.927
THE COURT THAT THEY'RE HAVING

01:13:18.994 --> 01:13:20.529
CONSISTENT STUFF TO DEAL WITH.

01:13:20.596 --> 01:13:21.597
IF THERE ARE CASE MANAGEMENT

01:13:21.663 --> 01:13:23.132
STAFF IN PLACE THE WORK STILL

01:13:23.198 --> 01:13:24.399
HAS TO GET DONE ITS COURT

01:13:24.466 --> 01:13:25.801
MANDATED AND SO IF THERE'S NOT

01:13:25.868 --> 01:13:27.336
AN ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF. TO

01:13:27.402 --> 01:13:29.004
PERFORM THE WORK AGAIN IT'S BEEN

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:30.105
PERFORMED BY THE CLINICIAN IN

01:13:30.172 --> 01:13:31.874
SOME CASES BY PSYCHIATRISTS AND

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:35.144
THAT IS VERY EXPENSIVE --

01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:35.677
PAPERWORK.

01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:37.780
I'M STILL WE WERE ABLE TO

01:13:37.846 --> 01:13:39.181
SUPPORT THE ADDITIONAL --

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:40.916
CASE MANAGEMENT STAFF AND IN

01:13:40.983 --> 01:13:42.651
TERMS OF THE DATA TRACKING STOCK

01:13:42.718 --> 01:13:44.219
THAT'S ONE OF THE KEYS TO ME OF

01:13:44.286 --> 01:13:45.821
THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE IF WE IF

01:13:45.888 --> 01:13:47.156
WE CAN'T.

01:13:47.222 --> 01:13:48.490
TRACK.

01:13:48.557 --> 01:13:49.958
AND REALLY LOOK AT THE DATA OF

01:13:50.025 --> 01:13:52.227
HOW WE'RE UTILIZING OUR STAFF --

01:13:52.294 --> 01:13:53.929
THEN WE DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:54.463
IMPROVE OR IF IT'S BEING

01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:55.831
EFFECTIVE AND IT'S A PRETTY

01:13:55.898 --> 01:13:58.033
MINIMAL INVESTMENT OF FIVE

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.536
POSITIONS --

01:14:00.602 --> 01:14:00.936
TO WRITE REALLY --

01:14:01.003 --> 01:14:01.737
ESTABLISH.

01:14:01.804 --> 01:14:04.506
A KIND OF A TO LIKE SOME OF THE

01:14:04.573 --> 01:14:06.408
QUESTIONS THAT YOU VAST I'M HERE

01:14:06.475 --> 01:14:08.177
TODAY I THINK COULD BE THE DATA

01:14:08.243 --> 01:14:10.479
COULD BE IMPROVED BY YOU KNOW

01:14:10.546 --> 01:14:12.114
ADDITIONAL DATA TRACKING STAFF --

01:14:12.181 --> 01:14:14.583
IN TERMS OF THE NEURO PSYCHOLOGY

01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:18.053
PROGRAM AND I WE APPRECIATE THE

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:19.655
LA AS RECOGNITION THAT --

01:14:19.721 --> 01:14:22.157
THAT THE INTENTIONAL EVALUATIONS --

01:14:22.224 --> 01:14:24.026
SEEM APPROPRIATE WE WOULD --

01:14:24.092 --> 01:14:26.028
JUST RESTATE THAT --

01:14:26.094 --> 01:14:26.895
ARE ESTAMOS VERY CONSERVATIVE

01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:28.230
FOR THE CLINICAL RESEARCH IT'S

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:29.765
COMING OUT OF PATTON ACTUALLY

01:14:29.832 --> 01:14:31.834
INDICATES THAT IT'S CLOSER 250%.

01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:33.068
OF PATIENTS COULD BENEFIT FROM

01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:35.237
THAT ADDITIONAL EVALUATION AND

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:36.772
WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS --

01:14:36.839 --> 01:14:38.841
THAT UP 225% OF PATIENTS WOULD

01:14:38.907 --> 01:14:40.442
GET THAT EVALUATION SO WE'RE

EVALUATIONS THAT GO INTO THE

01:15:40.736 --> 01:15:42.838
REPORT WRITING I DID A

01:15:42.905 --> 01:15:45.040
FELLOWSHIP FOUR YEAR FOLLOWING

01:15:49.578 --> 01:15:52.214
EVALUATIONS AND WRITE A REPORT.

01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:53.615
THEY TAKE A DIFFERENT SKILL SETS

01:15:53.682 --> 01:15:54.950
YOU KNOW WERE MENTAL HEALTH

01:15:55.017 --> 01:15:56.919
CLINICIANS WERE VERY EMPATHIC

01:15:56.985 --> 01:15:59.588
AND COMPASSIONATE WHEN YOU'RE

01:15:59.655 --> 01:16:01.256
WRITING A FORENSIC REPORT YOU

01:16:01.323 --> 01:16:02.958
HAVE TO BE VERY ANALYTICAL.

01:16:03.025 --> 01:16:04.493
YOU HAVE TO BE VERY OBJECTIVE

01:16:04.559 --> 01:16:05.460
NOT EVERY MENTAL HEALTH

01:16:05.527 --> 01:16:07.429

DOING THIS NOW OUT OF NECESSITY

01:16:12.868 --> 01:16:14.169
WHICH IS THE WAY WE'VE BEEN

01:16:14.236 --> 01:16:17.773
DOING IT AS WE SORT OF EVOLVED

01:16:17.839 --> 01:16:20.509
INTO THIS FRIEND SIX SYSTEM ALSO

01:16:20.575 --> 01:16:22.210
WRITES THE REPORTS IN MOST CASES

01:16:22.277 --> 01:16:23.412
THE PSYCHIATRIST.

01:16:23.478 --> 01:16:25.147
DOES ALL THE TESTIFYING TO THE

01:16:25.213 --> 01:16:27.849
REPORT IN ADDITION TO TAKING

01:16:27.916 --> 01:16:29.584
CARE OF A FULL CASELOAD DOING

01:16:29.651 --> 01:16:31.053
ALL THE MEN MANAGEMENT DOING ALL

01:16:31.119 --> 01:16:33.055
THE GROUPS IT CETERA.

01:16:33.121 --> 01:16:34.356
THIS CREATES A NUMBER OF

01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:36.591
PROBLEMS THE PROBLEM THE LA --

01:16:36.658 --> 01:16:38.493
SPOKE TO IS VERY REAL THE ISSUE

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:41.897
OF DUAL AGENCY HAVING YOUR TREE --

01:16:41.964 --> 01:16:43.665
ALSO BEING YOUR EVALUATOR AND

01:16:43.732 --> 01:16:44.700
JUST ABOUT EVERY PROFESSIONAL

01:16:44.766 --> 01:16:46.468
ORGANIZATION OUT THERE SAYS THIS

01:16:46.535 --> 01:16:47.569
IS AN ETHICAL CONFLICT OF

01:16:47.636 --> 01:16:48.870
INTEREST --%

01:16:48.937 --> 01:16:50.906
HOWEVER THERE'S ALSO THE ISSUE

01:16:50.973 --> 01:16:52.641
WITH A LACK OF TRAINING I

01:16:52.708 --> 01:16:54.743
CERTAINLY IF WE HAD A DEDICATED

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:55.811
FRIENDS A GOOD VALUE WAITERS WE

01:16:55.877 --> 01:16:57.512
COULD FOCUS ON THE TRAINING GET

01:16:57.579 --> 01:16:59.147
PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T HAD A POST

01:16:59.214 --> 01:17:00.315
DOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP IN AREN'T

01:17:00.382 --> 01:17:01.616
BOARD CERTIFIED.

01:17:01.683 --> 01:17:03.018
UP TO SPEED BUT TRAINING OUR

01:17:03.085 --> 01:17:06.888
ENTIRE GENERALIST STAFF APPROVES

01:17:06.955 --> 01:17:08.290
CUMBERSOME.

01:17:08.357 --> 01:17:09.658
I SPOKE TO THE LACK OF SKILLS

01:17:09.725 --> 01:17:10.892
AND ABILITY SOME PEOPLE JUST ARE

01:17:10.959 --> 01:17:13.128
NOT CUT OUT TO TESTIFY IN COURT

01:17:13.195 --> 01:17:14.463
AS A FORMER FRIENDS IT CHIEF I

01:17:14.529 --> 01:17:15.931
CAN TELL YOU.

01:17:15.998 --> 01:17:17.599
ABOUT SOME STORIES --

01:17:17.666 --> 01:17:19.468
WHERE WITH THAT BECAME CLEAR?

01:17:19.534 --> 01:17:20.502
AND THEN THERE ARE JUST

01:17:20.569 --> 01:17:22.904
INEFFICIENCIES SO IN IN TERMS OF

01:17:22.971 --> 01:17:25.207
THE PROPOSED REVIEW PROCESS IT'S

01:17:25.273 --> 01:17:26.708
INEFFICIENT.

01:17:26.775 --> 01:17:28.744
YES IT WOULD TAKE CARE OF THE

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:30.479
ISSUE OF DUAL AGENCY. TO SOME

01:17:30.545 --> 01:17:31.780
EXTENT --

01:17:31.847 --> 01:17:33.115
BUT YOU'D HAVE A CLINICIAN FROM

01:17:33.181 --> 01:17:35.017
ANOTHER UNIT WHO WOULD HAVE TO

01:17:35.083 --> 01:17:36.318
LEAVE THEIR PATIENTS.

01:17:36.385 --> 01:17:39.521
GO AND GET FAMILIAR WITH IN AN

01:17:39.588 --> 01:17:40.722
SOME OF THESE PATIENTS HAVE BEEN

01:17:40.789 --> 01:17:42.424
IN THE HOSPITAL FOR DECADES

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:44.226
REVIEWING THAT CASE COULD TAKE

01:17:44.292 --> 01:17:45.327
DAYS --

01:17:45.394 --> 01:17:46.962
PERFORMING THE ASSESSMENTS

01:17:47.029 --> 01:17:48.230
WRITING THE REPORT AND THEN CALL

01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:49.364
IT GETTING CALLED AWAY TO

01:17:49.431 --> 01:17:51.133
TESTIFY SO IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER

01:17:51.199 --> 01:17:52.434
CLINICIAN COMING IN TO DO THE

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:54.403
FRIENDS OF THE VALUATIONS.

01:17:54.469 --> 01:17:55.270
ACTUALLY ADDING TO OUR WORKLOAD

01:17:55.337 --> 01:17:56.838
NOW -- AND

01:17:56.905 --> 01:17:58.573
WE WERE BETTER OFF BEFORE THE

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.876
PEER REVIEW PROCESS IN ADDITION

01:18:00.942 --> 01:18:02.077
IF YOU HAVE A PEER REVIEW

01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:03.345
PROCESS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PEER

01:18:03.412 --> 01:18:04.846
REVIEWER SO THIS IS ANOTHER

01:18:04.913 --> 01:18:07.249
WORKLOAD ADDITION TO OUR STAFF

01:18:07.315 --> 01:18:07.849
THAT WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE

01:18:07.916 --> 01:18:09.384
UNDER THIS.

01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:11.086
PROPOSED MODEL BY THE LA --

01:18:11.153 --> 01:18:12.521
ADDITIONALLY THE PEER REVIEW OR

01:18:12.587 --> 01:18:14.289
PROCESS WON'T RESOLVE THE ISSUE

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:16.224
OF DUAL AGENCY I THINK YOU HEARD

01:18:16.291 --> 01:18:17.759
OUR DIRECTOR TALKING ABOUT THE

01:18:17.826 --> 01:18:19.428
PRESSURES ON OUR SYSTEMS TO

01:18:19.494 --> 01:18:21.229
ADMIT PEOPLE THAT MEANS A LOT OF

01:18:21.296 --> 01:18:23.131
PATIENT MOVEMENT AND THAT MEANS.

01:18:23.198 --> 01:18:24.533
WE CAN'T GUARANTEE WHICH

01:18:24.599 --> 01:18:25.934
PATIENTS GOING TO BE ON WHOSE

01:18:26.001 --> 01:18:27.335
CASELOAD ON A GIVEN DAY

01:18:27.402 --> 01:18:29.871
UNFORTUNATELY SO WHILE THIS

01:18:29.938 --> 01:18:31.873
PERSON MAY HAVE --

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:33.475
AND EVALUATE OF ROLE TODAY

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:34.810
TOMORROW THAT PERSON TO BE DEAR

01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:37.045
DOCTOR AND SO WE STILL ARE BACK

01:18:37.112 --> 01:18:38.780
TO THE ISSUE OF DUAL AGENCY IN

01:18:38.847 --> 01:18:40.182
THE RISK THAT IT PUTS OUR

01:18:40.248 --> 01:18:41.383
CLINICIANS THAT --

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:43.151
WE HAVE HAD VERY VERY BAD

01:18:43.218 --> 01:18:44.653
OUTCOMES --

01:18:44.719 --> 01:18:46.221
WHEN A PSYCHIATRIST HAVE GONE

01:18:46.288 --> 01:18:47.756
INTO COURT FOR EXAMPLE AND SAID

01:18:47.823 --> 01:18:49.291
SOMEONE NEEDS INVOLUNTARY

01:18:49.357 --> 01:18:50.659
MEDICATIONS --

01:18:50.725 --> 01:18:52.160
WE'VE HAD PSYCHIATRIST NOT COME

01:18:52.227 --> 01:18:55.764
BACK TO WORK AGAIN AFTER A CASES

01:18:55.831 --> 01:18:56.965
LIKE THAT.

01:18:57.032 --> 01:18:57.566
SAID THE DO AGENCY ISSUE WON'T

01:18:57.632 --> 01:18:58.233
BE RESOLVED ALL THE PEER REVIEW

01:18:58.300 --> 01:18:59.968
PROCESS WILL DO IS ADD TO OUR

01:19:00.035 --> 01:19:01.436
CURRENT WORKLOAD.

01:19:01.503 --> 01:19:02.471
ADDITIONALLY THE PEER REVIEW OUR

01:19:02.537 --> 01:19:04.139
PROCESS DOESN'T SOLVE THE ISSUE

01:19:04.206 --> 01:19:06.475
OF LACK OF SKILLS AND ABILITIES

01:19:06.541 --> 01:19:07.542
THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE

01:19:07.609 --> 01:19:08.043
TO MAKE.

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:09.878
A FRIENDS AGO VALUE WAITERS OUT

01:19:09.945 --> 01:19:11.780
OF ALL OF OUR CLINICIANS AND IT

01:19:11.847 --> 01:19:13.281
DOESN'T SOLVE THE TRAINING ISSUE

01:19:13.348 --> 01:19:14.816
WE ESTIMATE WOULD TAKE DOZENS OF

01:19:14.883 --> 01:19:16.351
HOURS TO GET PEOPLE UP TO THE

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:19.054
SPEED OF BEING A GOOD FRIENDS OF

01:19:19.121 --> 01:19:19.454
THE VALUE RATE --

01:19:19.521 --> 01:19:22.657
THAT'S TIME LEARN HOW TO DO GOOD

01:19:22.724 --> 01:19:24.059
CYCLE PHARMACOLOGY GOOD

01:19:24.126 --> 01:19:25.494
BEHAVIORAL TREATMENTS TRAUMA

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:27.395
INFORMED CARE THE THINGS THAT WE

01:19:27.462 --> 01:19:28.196
NEED TO DO TO TAKE CARE OF OUR

01:19:28.263 --> 01:19:28.964
PATIENTS.

01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:30.599
AND FOR THESE REASONS ARE WE DO

01:19:30.665 --> 01:19:32.400
NOT FEEL THE PEER REVIEW OUR

01:19:32.467 --> 01:19:34.669
MODEL WOULD WORK.

01:19:34.736 --> 01:19:37.139
HELLO ANY RESPONSE SURE SO ONE

01:19:37.205 --> 01:19:38.340
THING I WANT TO EMPHASIZE IS

01:19:38.406 --> 01:19:40.609
THAT A LOT OF THE WEAKNESSES

01:19:40.675 --> 01:19:42.711
WITH THE PEER REVIEW MODEL ALSO

01:19:42.777 --> 01:19:44.045
EXIST IN THE CURRENT.

01:19:44.112 --> 01:19:45.380
ONE CURRENTLY --

01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:46.882
CLINICIANS ARE BEING CALLED AWAY

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:48.750
FROM THEIR CASE LOAD TO DO THIS

01:19:48.817 --> 01:19:49.384
WORK.

01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:50.852
THEY WOULD JUST BE BEING CALLED

01:19:50.919 --> 01:19:52.921
THE WAY TO DO THIS WORK FOR

01:19:52.988 --> 01:19:54.856
DIFFERENT PATIENTS SO THIS ONE

01:19:54.923 --> 01:19:56.224
NECESSARILY PUT US IN A

01:19:56.291 --> 01:19:58.693
DIFFERENT PLACE THAN WE ARE NOW.

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:00.128
THE OTHER THING WE HAD NOTE IS

01:20:00.195 --> 01:20:01.897
WE WERE PROVIDED WITH DATA TO

01:20:01.963 --> 01:20:03.598
SUBSTANTIATE THAT THE QUALITY OF

01:20:03.665 --> 01:20:04.933
THE REPORTS COMING OUT OF THE

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:05.667
DEPARTMENT RIGHT NOW ARE

01:20:05.734 --> 01:20:06.968
INSUFFICIENT.

01:20:07.035 --> 01:20:08.036
THERE WERE SOME ANECDOTAL

01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:09.204
ACCOUNTS BUT NOTHING

01:20:09.271 --> 01:20:10.639
QUANTITATIVE THAT WE COULD

01:20:10.705 --> 01:20:12.274
REALLY SINK OUR TEETH INTO.

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:14.209
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT --

01:20:14.276 --> 01:20:16.077
TRAINING WE THINK TRAINING COULD

01:20:16.144 --> 01:20:17.179
BE AN EFFECTIVE WAY OF

01:20:17.245 --> 01:20:18.847
ADDRESSING THIS FOR EXAMPLE WE

01:20:18.914 --> 01:20:20.515
KNOW THAT --

01:20:20.582 --> 01:20:21.917
IT'S SOMEWHAT TROUBLING.

01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:23.151
BUT THE CLINICIANS WERE

01:20:23.218 --> 01:20:24.853
ATTEMPTING TO SAY RESTORE

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:26.721
PATIENT TO COMPETENCY AREN'T

01:20:26.788 --> 01:20:27.956
FAMILIAR WITH THE LEGAL

01:20:28.023 --> 01:20:29.958
REQUIREMENTS SURROUNDING WHAT

01:20:30.025 --> 01:20:31.560
JUDGES ARE LOOKING FOR TO CLEAR

01:20:31.626 --> 01:20:33.528
PATIENT COMPETENT SO WE THINK

01:20:33.595 --> 01:20:34.529
THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT IS A

01:20:34.596 --> 01:20:35.297
PROBLEM.

01:20:35.363 --> 01:20:38.033
A TRAINING PROGRAM --

01:20:38.099 --> 01:20:42.103
IS IN ORDER WITH THREE THE

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:43.972
COGNITIVE REMEDIATION THERAPY

01:20:44.039 --> 01:20:45.941
ALREADY HAVING BEEN PUT IN PLACE

01:20:46.007 --> 01:20:47.876
AT A COUPLE STATE HOSPITALS --

01:20:47.943 --> 01:20:49.377
SPECIFICALLY AT PATTON WEIRD

01:20:49.444 --> 01:20:51.713
NOTE THAT THE STAFFING AND THE

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:53.181
APPROACH IS GOING TO BE

01:20:53.248 --> 01:20:54.516
DIFFERENT UNDER THE

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:56.017
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IN

01:20:56.084 --> 01:20:58.086
FRONT OF YOU NOW SO WE DON'T

01:20:58.153 --> 01:20:58.486
CONSIDER THAT --

01:20:58.553 --> 01:21:00.455
AN EFFECTIVE TEST OF WHETHER OR

01:21:00.522 --> 01:21:02.824
NOT THE COGNITIVE REMEDIATION

01:21:02.891 --> 01:21:05.260
WOULD BE EFFECTIVE AND WE THINK

01:21:05.327 --> 01:21:06.528
A PILOT IS STILL.

01:21:06.595 --> 01:21:08.263
IN ORDER --

01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:10.498
AND THEN THE THE OTHER THING I

01:21:10.565 --> 01:21:11.833
DID WANT TO KNOW IS WE WEREN'T

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:13.335
PROVIDED WITH DATA TO SHOW THAT

01:21:13.401 --> 01:21:15.270
THE ADMINISTRATIVE STAFFING THAT

01:21:15.337 --> 01:21:18.173
THE CASE MANAGEMENT AND DATA

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.107
STAFF.

01:21:19.174 --> 01:21:20.609
ARE UNABLE TO DO THERE THE

01:21:20.675 --> 01:21:22.110
COMPLETE THEIR WORK LOAD NOW AND

01:21:22.177 --> 01:21:23.678
THAT CLINICIANS ARE BEING FORCED

01:21:23.745 --> 01:21:24.846
TO DO SO.

01:21:24.913 --> 01:21:26.581
THANK YOU SIR.

01:21:26.648 --> 01:21:27.949
AT THIS TIME WILL TAKE PUBLIC

01:21:28.016 --> 01:21:40.195
COMMENT ON ISSUE.

01:21:40.262 --> 01:21:42.764
THREE HEATHER SALIH FROM AS MAY

01:21:42.831 --> 01:21:43.365
TWENTY SIX TWENTY WE REPRESENT

01:21:43.431 --> 01:21:44.766
THE SENIOR.

01:21:44.833 --> 01:21:45.600
PSYCHOLOGIST SPECIALISTS

01:21:45.667 --> 01:21:48.603
SPECIALISTS THE PSYCHOLOGIST --

01:21:48.670 --> 01:21:49.871
AND WE ARE.

01:21:49.938 --> 01:21:51.573
CONCERNED ABOUT THE SUGGESTION

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:52.974
OF THE PEER REVIEW FOR A NUMBER

01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:54.576
OF REASONS I THINK IT'S BEEN

01:21:54.643 --> 01:21:56.478
WELL DOCUMENTED TODAY AND TALKED

01:21:56.544 --> 01:21:58.113
ABOUT THE ISSUE OF TRAINING.

01:21:58.179 --> 01:22:00.015
AND THE CLINICAL EXPERTISE WE

01:22:00.081 --> 01:22:01.850
HAVE VERY GOOD CLINICIANS WHO

01:22:01.916 --> 01:22:04.419
MAY NOT BE GOOD COURT REPORTING.

01:22:04.486 --> 01:22:06.621
THE VALUE WAITERS OR WRITERS OR

01:22:06.688 --> 01:22:08.523
OR ABLE TO GIVE TESTIMONY --

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:10.592
SO THAT HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT I

01:22:10.659 --> 01:22:11.626
THINK --

01:22:11.693 --> 01:22:13.228
PRETTY WELL BUT I I WANTED TO

01:22:13.295 --> 01:22:14.729
ADD A COUPLE OF ISSUES.

01:22:14.796 --> 01:22:18.500
OF FOR ONE YEAH WE HAVE IS THAT

01:22:18.566 --> 01:22:20.235
OUR PATIENTS HAVE TWENTY HOURS

01:22:20.302 --> 01:22:21.670
PER WEEK OF GROUPS.

01:22:21.736 --> 01:22:23.838
THOSE GROUPS ARE ARE FACILITATED

01:22:23.905 --> 01:22:25.974
BY CLINICIANS THROUGHOUT THE

01:22:26.041 --> 01:22:28.176
HOSPITAL SO IF YOU COULD HAVE A

01:22:28.243 --> 01:22:30.045
PEER REVIEW PERSON WHO IS

01:22:30.111 --> 01:22:31.846
ACTUALLY PROVIDING TREATMENT IN

01:22:31.913 --> 01:22:33.248
A GROUP JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT%

01:22:33.315 --> 01:22:34.582
ON THEIR CASE SO THEY WILL STILL

01:22:34.649 --> 01:22:35.283
HAVE THAT.

01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:36.818
INTERACTION IN THIS THE CONFLICT

01:22:36.885 --> 01:22:39.154
OF INTEREST WILL STILL EXIST FOR

01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:41.122
THE IT IN THAT SITUATION --

01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:42.257
ADDITIONALLY --

01:22:42.324 --> 01:22:44.993
AS AS WAS POINTED OUT WHEN.

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:46.728
WHEN WE HAVE PAPERWORK WE HAVE A

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:48.496
SAYING AS A CLINICIAN I GUESS I

01:22:48.563 --> 01:22:49.864
SHOULD SAY I WORK AT CLING TO

01:22:49.931 --> 01:22:50.932
STATE HOSPITAL?

01:22:50.999 --> 01:22:52.834
AND WE HAVE A SAYING THAT

01:22:52.901 --> 01:22:54.102
SOMETIMES WERE TREATING THE

01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:55.804
PAPER INSTEAD OF THE PATIENT.

01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:58.173
AND SO EVERY MOMENT WE TAKE THAT

01:22:58.239 --> 01:22:59.741
WE HAVE TO TREAT THE PAPER.

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:01.009
THE PATIENT IS GOING WITHOUT

01:23:01.076 --> 01:23:03.211
TREATMENT AND WHAT HAPPENS THEN

01:23:03.278 --> 01:23:04.512
IS THAT THE PATIENT IS THE

01:23:04.579 --> 01:23:05.947
STABILIZED.

01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:07.782
THE VIOLENCE GOES UP NOT ONLY

01:23:07.849 --> 01:23:09.784
GET STAFF BUT AGAINST OTHER

01:23:09.851 --> 01:23:11.286
PATIENTS AS WELL.

01:23:11.353 --> 01:23:12.954
THEN YOU HAVE --

01:23:13.021 --> 01:23:14.489
YOU IT YOU HAVE THE VIOLENCE

01:23:14.556 --> 01:23:16.224
GOES UP WE HAVE A HIGHER

01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:18.426
TURNOVER RATE WE HAVE TO BRING

01:23:18.493 --> 01:23:20.395
MORE PEOPLE INTO TRAIN THEM WE

01:23:20.462 --> 01:23:21.296
HAVE A HARD TIME.

01:23:21.363 --> 01:23:23.665
RETAINING OUR STAFF AND IN

01:23:23.732 --> 01:23:25.633
ADDITION TO THAT THEN --

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:28.002
WE'RE RELYING MORE ON CONTRACTOR

01:23:28.069 --> 01:23:29.237
WE HAVE A CONTINUITY OF CARE

01:23:29.304 --> 01:23:31.406
WHICH DESTABILIZE THE PATIENT

01:23:31.473 --> 01:23:33.875
AND INCREASES THE OF VIOLENCE SO

01:23:33.942 --> 01:23:35.910
WE'RE WE'RE NOT IN FAVOR AT ALL

01:23:35.977 --> 01:23:36.945

NEED TO FILL MORE POSITIONS

01:23:54.162 --> 01:23:55.864
CHRONICALLY UNDERSTAFFED AND

01:23:55.930 --> 01:23:57.232
CONTRACTING OUT IS CONTINUE TO

PROTECTS NOT ONLY THE COMMUNITY

01:24:03.405 --> 01:24:04.706
BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:24:04.773 --> 01:24:05.874
SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS THAT

01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:07.442
ARE BEING EVALUATED AND HOW

01:24:07.509 --> 01:24:09.744

BIT ABOUT THE STAFFING STANDARDS --

01:38:21.095 --> 01:38:22.696
WE THINK THAT THE PROPOSED

01:38:22.763 --> 01:38:24.632

THAT ARE CURRENTLY PERFORMED BY

01:38:35.075 --> 01:38:36.644
NURSES REALLY REPRESENTS AN

01:38:36.710 --> 01:38:37.878
IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD FOR THE

01:38:37.945 --> 01:38:39.046

01:38:39.113 --> 01:38:41.115

SIMILAR TYPE STAFFING STANDARDS

01:38:43.017 --> 01:38:44.285
IS SOMETHING OUR OFFICE IS

01:38:44.351 --> 01:38:45.919
RECOMMENDED IN THE PAST AND SO

01:38:45.986 --> 01:38:47.354
WE THINK THAT THIS IS LIKE A

01:38:47.421 --> 01:38:48.656
SAID A REALLY IMPORTANT STEP

01:38:48.722 --> 01:38:49.757
FORWARD --

01:38:49.823 --> 01:38:51.091
THE ONE THING WE WOULD NOTE

01:38:51.158 --> 01:38:53.060
HOWEVER IS THAT IT WOULD PUT IN

01:38:53.127 --> 01:38:55.963
PLACE CURRENT PRACTICE LEVEL A

01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:57.598
STAFFING STANDARDS AS OPPOSED TO

01:38:57.665 --> 01:38:59.767
STAFFING STANDARDS THAT ARE

01:38:59.833 --> 01:39:00.567
NECESSARILY OPTIMAL.

01:39:00.634 --> 01:39:01.635
WELL THE DEPARTMENT DID WORK

01:39:01.702 --> 01:39:02.770
WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF

01:39:02.836 --> 01:39:04.838
CALIFORNIA IRVINE. TO VERIFY

01:39:04.905 --> 01:39:06.373
THAT THEIR METHODOLOGY ACT --

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.676

01:39:08.742 --> 01:39:10.444
OF STAFF THAT ARE CURRENTLY

01:39:10.511 --> 01:39:11.912
BEING USED --

01:39:11.979 --> 01:39:13.881
IT DID NOT ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT

01:39:13.947 --> 01:39:15.516
THE CURRENT STAFFING LEVELS ARE

01:39:15.582 --> 01:39:17.651
ACTUALLY OPTIMAL IN FACT THE

01:39:17.718 --> 01:39:19.620
STUDY NOTED THAT IT COULD RESULT

01:39:19.687 --> 01:39:21.288
IN SUBOPTIMAL STAFFING AND

01:39:21.355 --> 01:39:22.756
RECOMMENDED THAT DEPARTMENT.

01:39:22.823 --> 01:39:24.525
REVIEW IT STAFFING STANDARDS IN

01:39:24.591 --> 01:39:26.427
THE FUTURE SO WE'RE RECOMMENDING

01:39:26.493 --> 01:39:28.862
THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED

01:39:28.929 --> 01:39:30.397
THE STAFFING STANDARDS NOW AND

01:39:30.464 --> 01:39:32.399

01:39:32.466 --> 01:39:33.300
WITH THOSE.

01:39:33.367 --> 01:39:34.468
BUT THAT IT DIRECTED THE

01:39:34.535 --> 01:39:36.370
DEPARTMENT --

01:39:36.437 --> 01:39:38.105
TO ENGAGE WITH AN INDEPENDENT

CLINICAL STAFFING ANALYSIS.

01:39:41.742 --> 01:39:43.210
AND SPECIFICALLY THAT ANALYSIS

01:39:43.277 --> 01:39:44.845
WOULD INCLUDE AN EVALUATION OF

01:39:44.912 --> 01:39:46.580
THE DEPARTMENT'S CLINICAL

01:39:46.647 --> 01:39:48.916
STOPPING BOTH FOR NURSING.

01:39:48.982 --> 01:39:50.351
AND NON NURSING STAFF.

01:39:50.417 --> 01:39:51.752
NON NURSING CLINICAL STAFF I

01:39:51.819 --> 01:39:52.920
SHOULD SAY IT WOULD INCLUDE AN

01:39:52.986 --> 01:39:54.154
ASSESSMENT OF THE APPROPRIATE

01:39:54.221 --> 01:39:55.689

IN EACH OF THE DIFFERENT UNIT

01:39:59.526 --> 01:40:01.328
TYPES AN ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER

01:40:01.395 --> 01:40:02.896
MORE TASK COULD BE ASSIGNED TO

01:40:02.963 --> 01:40:04.298
EITHER LOWER CLASS COST

01:40:06.333 --> 01:40:06.967
STAFF.

01:40:07.034 --> 01:40:08.402
AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO ENSURE

01:40:08.469 --> 01:40:10.270
THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS UTILIZING

01:40:10.337 --> 01:40:11.839

01:40:11.905 --> 01:40:13.774
AS POSSIBLE AND WE ESTIMATE THAT

01:40:13.841 --> 01:40:15.509
AN ANALYSIS LIKE THIS COULD COST

01:40:15.576 --> 01:40:17.344
IN THE LOW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

01:40:17.411 --> 01:40:18.412
OF DOLLARS --

01:40:18.479 --> 01:40:19.947
WITH RESPECT TO THE MEDICATION

01:40:20.013 --> 01:40:21.715
ROOM STOPPING WE DO THINK IT'S A

01:40:21.782 --> 01:40:23.117
PROPOSAL THAT MERITS

01:40:23.183 --> 01:40:24.418
CONSIDERATION HOWEVER.

01:40:24.485 --> 01:40:25.686
THE DEPARTMENT WASN'T ABLE TO

01:40:25.753 --> 01:40:26.987
PROVIDE DATA SHOWING

01:40:27.054 --> 01:40:29.523
CONCLUSIVELY THAT THE NEED TO

01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:31.558
PULL STAFF FOR MEDICATION PASS

01:40:31.625 --> 01:40:32.726
RESULTS AND NEGATIVE PATIENT

01:40:32.793 --> 01:40:34.695
OUTCOMES LAKE INCREASES IN

01:40:34.762 --> 01:40:35.596
VIOLENCE.

01:40:35.662 --> 01:40:37.798
AND GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE

01:40:37.865 --> 01:40:41.135
RESORT I THINK A BETTER APPROACH

01:40:41.201 --> 01:40:42.836
WOULD BE TO PILOT --

01:40:42.903 --> 01:40:44.805
ADDITIONAL STAFF SPECIFICALLY

01:40:44.872 --> 01:40:45.439
WE'D RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:40:45.506 --> 01:40:47.441
LEGISLATURE APPROVED SEVEN POINT

01:40:47.508 --> 01:40:49.777
ONE MILLION DOLLARS AND SIXTY

01:40:49.843 --> 01:40:50.544
THREE STAFF WHICH WOULD BE

01:40:50.611 --> 01:40:52.713
ENOUGH TO STAFF TWENTY FOUR

01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:54.748
MEDICATION ROOMS FOR A PERIOD OF

01:40:54.815 --> 01:40:55.449
THREE YEARS.

01:40:55.516 --> 01:40:56.483
AND THAT IT REQUIRE THE

01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:58.485
DEPARTMENT TO REPORT ON THE FACT

01:40:58.552 --> 01:40:59.987
THAT THESE ADDITIONAL STAFF HAVE

01:41:00.053 --> 01:41:02.222
ON PATIENT OUTCOMES AND VIOLENCE.

01:41:02.289 --> 01:41:03.657
FINALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE

01:41:03.724 --> 01:41:04.691
EVENING AND OVERNIGHT

01:41:04.758 --> 01:41:05.893
SUPERVISORS WE THINK IT MAKES

01:41:05.959 --> 01:41:07.528
SENSE THAT A SUPERVISOR HAS TO

01:41:07.594 --> 01:41:08.896
BE PHYSICALLY PRESENT TO BE

01:41:08.962 --> 01:41:09.730
EFFECTIVE.

01:41:09.797 --> 01:41:11.231
AND SO WE RECOMMEND APPROVING

01:41:11.298 --> 01:41:12.966
THOSE PROPOSALS THAT THOSE

01:41:13.033 --> 01:41:14.301
POSITIONS.

THANK YOU SIR.

01:41:15.469 --> 01:41:16.770

01:41:24.978 --> 01:41:28.015
THAT THE VALIDATION BY UC IRVINE --

01:41:28.081 --> 01:41:31.018
AND THEN THE SUBSEQUENT OF OUR

01:41:31.084 --> 01:41:34.188
MISSION BASED REVIEW --

01:41:34.254 --> 01:41:35.155
PROCESS --

01:41:35.222 --> 01:41:37.024
HAS TAKEN A DEEPER LOOK THEN

01:41:37.090 --> 01:41:39.193
PERHAPS --

01:41:39.259 --> 01:41:40.294
IT WOULD DO --

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:42.029
AND WHAT WOULD HAVE OCCURRED AT

01:41:42.095 --> 01:41:44.231
WITH THE YOU KNOW WITH JUST THAT

01:41:44.298 --> 01:41:45.299

01:41:45.365 --> 01:41:46.667
BY ITSELF HOWEVER THE WORK THAT

01:41:46.733 --> 01:41:47.768
THE DEPARTMENT IS DONE REALLY

01:41:47.835 --> 01:41:50.070

THE WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEEN

01:42:03.684 --> 01:42:05.319
DONE AND I THINK THESE RESOURCES

01:42:05.385 --> 01:42:08.789
ARE A FIRST STEP AND WOULD PUT --

01:42:08.856 --> 01:42:09.256
WHAT PUT REALLY MORE

01:42:09.323 --> 01:42:10.557

01:42:28.275 --> 01:42:30.410
FROM THE STARTING PLACE --

01:42:30.477 --> 01:42:32.513
IT FOR THE MEDICATION ROOMS --

01:42:32.579 --> 01:42:33.614
THIS WAS SOMETHING AGAIN THAT I

01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:35.582
THAT I LEARNED FROM OBSERVATION

01:42:35.649 --> 01:42:37.050
WATCHING THE STAFF AND THE

01:42:37.117 --> 01:42:38.886

RECOGNIZED IN THE BUDGET --

01:44:16.717 --> 01:44:18.018
WE HAVE BEEN DRAMATICALLY

01:44:18.085 --> 01:44:19.853
UNDERSTAFFED FOR THE PATIENT

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:22.589
POPULATION THAT HE HAVE SERVED

01:44:22.656 --> 01:44:24.257

WE'RE NOW SERVING 90% FRIENDS IT

01:44:36.637 --> 01:44:38.238

YOU KNOW.

01:44:39.306 --> 01:44:41.975
THIS IS JUST A WHOLLY DIFFERENT

01:44:42.042 --> 01:44:44.811
PERSON THAT WE ARE NOW SERVING --

01:44:44.878 --> 01:44:46.813
ADDITIONALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:49.716
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE DEPARTMENTS.

01:44:49.783 --> 01:44:51.985
LAST YEAR WE HAD TWENTY SEVEN

01:44:52.052 --> 01:44:53.220
HUNDRED ASSAULTS ON STAFF.

01:44:53.286 --> 01:44:54.988
THAT'S A BIG NUMBER BUT THAT IS

01:44:55.055 --> 01:44:58.325
DOWN FROM FOUR THOUSAND AND

01:44:58.392 --> 01:44:59.092
TWENTY TEN THAT IS A HUGE

01:44:59.159 --> 01:45:00.494
IMPROVEMENT WE'VE MADE HUGE

01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:02.195
STRIDES IN THIS DEPARTMENT WE'VE

01:45:02.262 --> 01:45:04.031
INCREASED SLOWLY AND SURELY THE

01:45:04.097 --> 01:45:05.332
STAFFING.

01:45:05.399 --> 01:45:08.168
A LITTLE BY LITTLE TO GET TO THE

01:45:08.235 --> 01:45:13.740
FINALLY WHERE WE ARE NOW --

01:45:13.807 --> 01:45:18.745
UNFORTUNATELY THE THE STAFFING

01:45:18.812 --> 01:45:20.981
LEVELS ARE.

01:45:21.048 --> 01:45:23.650
NOT WHERE THEY NEED TO BE IN --

01:45:23.717 --> 01:45:26.053
JUST IN TWENTY SIXTEEN PSYCH TAX

01:45:26.119 --> 01:45:27.788

01:45:29.022 --> 01:45:31.425
HOSPITALS THEY WORKED ONE POINT

01:45:31.491 --> 01:45:34.127
FOUR MILLION HOURS OF OVERTIME.

01:45:34.194 --> 01:45:36.763
OF WHICH SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:39.232
HOURS WERE INVOLUNTARY OVERTIME.

01:45:39.299 --> 01:45:41.902
THIS PROPOSAL RAY HERE WOULD

01:45:41.968 --> 01:45:43.603
EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE.

01:45:43.670 --> 01:45:45.539
THE MANDATORY OVER OVER TIME

01:45:45.605 --> 01:45:47.107
PORTION.

01:45:47.174 --> 01:45:49.543
SO WE WE WANT EVERYBODY TO HAVE

01:45:49.609 --> 01:45:50.811
THAT THOUGHT IN THE BACK OF

01:45:50.877 --> 01:45:52.179
THEIR MIND.

01:45:52.245 --> 01:45:54.414
THE ONE THING.

01:45:54.481 --> 01:45:55.949
BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY FATHOM AS

01:45:56.016 --> 01:45:58.351

WALK OUT THE DOOR.

01:46:11.631 --> 01:46:14.301
AND THEN YOU GET TAPPED ON THE

01:46:14.367 --> 01:46:16.002
WORK ANOTHER EIGHT HOUR SHIFT.

01:46:16.069 --> 01:46:17.137
YOU KNOW YOU MAY NOT OF PACKED

01:46:17.204 --> 01:46:18.605

A SIX YEAR OLD DAUGHTER THAT

01:46:25.445 --> 01:46:28.248
WOULD BE INCREDIBLY HARD --

01:46:28.315 --> 01:46:28.882
YOU MAY NOT HAVE GOTTEN ENOUGH

01:46:28.949 --> 01:46:30.650
SLEEP I MEAN HOW CAN YOU GET

01:46:30.717 --> 01:46:32.119
ENOUGH SLEEP TO WORK A SIXTEEN

NOT HAVE GOTTEN ENOUGH SLEEP. TO

01:46:36.089 --> 01:46:36.356
HANDLE THAT.

01:46:36.423 --> 01:46:38.258
SO THEN I WANT TO PUT THE HUMAN

01:46:38.325 --> 01:46:40.093
ELEMENT TO THE SIDE OF WHAT THE

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:41.361

IS A DAILY OCCURRENCE.

01:46:48.568 --> 01:46:50.704
AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE

01:46:50.771 --> 01:46:53.640
NUMBERS AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:46:53.707 --> 01:46:55.776

01:53:51.591 --> 01:53:53.760
AND WHEN I WHEN I SEEN THE

01:53:53.826 --> 01:53:55.528
INTAKE THOSE JUST COMING OUT

01:53:55.595 --> 01:53:57.330
FROM -- THE

01:53:57.397 --> 01:53:59.199
BUS AND DOING THE INTAKE THERE

01:53:59.265 --> 01:54:01.034
WAS NO WALL THERE WAS NO SAFETY

01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:02.335
FEATURES IT WAS JUST AS GOOD

01:54:02.402 --> 01:54:03.870
EVEN CLOSER THAN YOU AND I ARE

01:54:03.937 --> 01:54:04.904
NOW.

01:54:04.971 --> 01:54:06.673
SO THE SAFETY OF OF THE THE

01:54:06.739 --> 01:54:08.007
TECHNICIANS THAT ARE THERE AND

01:54:08.074 --> 01:54:09.008
THEN ALL THE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE

01:54:09.075 --> 01:54:10.743
THERE IT'S IT'S A REAL.

01:54:10.810 --> 01:54:13.146
DRAMA REAL DILEMMA FOR THEM SO

01:54:13.213 --> 01:54:15.381
WHEN I SEE THE THE OVERTIME IN

01:54:15.448 --> 01:54:17.250
THE BUDGET FOR THAT TRYING TO

01:54:17.317 --> 01:54:18.518
GET A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:54:18.585 --> 01:54:20.153
INFORMATION ON THAT BECAUSE AS

01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:22.956
FAR AS WHERE THE EMPLOYEES ARE

01:54:23.022 --> 01:54:24.224
EVERYONE HAS TO BE PRETTY MUCH.

01:54:24.290 --> 01:54:26.359
ON THEIR ON THEIR WITS RIGHT --

01:54:26.426 --> 01:54:28.027
TO SEE OF ANY PROBLEMS ARE

01:54:28.094 --> 01:54:29.996
COMING ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

01:54:30.063 --> 01:54:31.931
AND WE DID SEE THAT --

01:54:31.998 --> 01:54:33.933
THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE IS ON

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:35.301
THE SITE TAX EMPLOYEES THAT ARE

01:54:35.368 --> 01:54:35.535
THERE.

01:54:35.602 --> 01:54:36.336
THEY PUSH A BUTTON AND THEN

01:54:36.402 --> 01:54:40.206
EVERYBODY --

01:54:40.273 --> 01:54:42.175
DESTABILIZE THE SITUATION IT'S

01:54:42.242 --> 01:54:45.445
THEIR ITSELF SO IT TRULY IS A A

01:54:45.511 --> 01:54:47.580
SITUATION THAT HAVE SOME HAVEN'T

01:54:47.647 --> 01:54:50.216
TOURED ONE IN THE THE HOSPITALS

01:54:50.283 --> 01:54:51.517
TO SEE THAT IMPACT IT'S THERE.

01:54:51.584 --> 01:54:53.620
SO IT'S GREAT TO SEE THESE

01:54:53.686 --> 01:54:56.289
POSITIONS COMING IN BUT YET --

01:54:56.356 --> 01:54:57.523
HEARING IT FROM SOME OF THE

01:54:57.590 --> 01:54:58.691
SPEAKERS THAT WERE THERE AS FAR

01:54:58.758 --> 01:55:01.427
AS MANDATORY OVERTIME VERSUS

01:55:01.494 --> 01:55:05.431
VOLUNTARY DOES THAT PUT MORE.

01:55:05.498 --> 01:55:06.699
TECHNICIANS OR EMPLOYEES.

01:55:06.766 --> 01:55:09.235
AT RISK BECAUSE NOW FOR INJURY

01:55:09.302 --> 01:55:11.037
BECAUSE OF THE THE INTERACTION

01:55:11.104 --> 01:55:12.605
THAT'S GOING ON THERE WITHIN THE

01:55:12.672 --> 01:55:14.007
HOSPITAL'S ITSELF.

01:55:14.073 --> 01:55:15.441
AND HOW DO YOU.

01:55:15.508 --> 01:55:17.410
BE ABLE TO START TO ADDRESS THAT

01:55:17.477 --> 01:55:19.545
AND I KNOW IT AND AND ISSUE FIVE

01:55:19.612 --> 01:55:20.913
WE TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT

01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:22.882
RETENTION AND RECRUITMENT AND

01:55:22.949 --> 01:55:24.083
THOSE TYPES OF DEALS.

01:55:24.150 --> 01:55:25.585
BUT WE'RE STARTING TO NOW BE

01:55:25.652 --> 01:55:27.487
ADDRESSED THE ISSUE THAT'S IN

01:55:27.553 --> 01:55:29.856
FRONT OF THE WORK FORCE WITHIN

01:55:29.922 --> 01:55:31.257
THE HOSPITALS THAT ARE THERE.

01:55:31.324 --> 01:55:33.059
COULD THOSE SIMPLE DISCUSSION

01:55:33.126 --> 01:55:35.695
STARTING NOW START TO LOOK AT

01:55:35.762 --> 01:55:37.897
THE RETENTION DOWN THE ROAD THAT

01:55:37.964 --> 01:55:39.032
WE'RE GOING TO SEE IN THE NEXT

01:55:39.098 --> 01:55:40.533
ISSUE AN ISSUE.

01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:41.434
FIVE OF HOW WE'RE WE'RE

01:55:41.501 --> 01:55:42.835
RETAINING THOSE INDIVIDUALS

01:55:42.902 --> 01:55:43.736
THERE.

01:55:43.803 --> 01:55:46.205
AND I THINK LOOKING AT THE

01:55:46.272 --> 01:55:46.873
DEDICATED MEDICATION ROOMS THOSE

01:55:46.939 --> 01:55:49.876
ARE WHEN WE WERE THERE WE WE

01:55:49.942 --> 01:55:51.377
SEEN THE MEDICATION ROOM AND I

01:55:51.444 --> 01:55:52.145
THINK.

01:55:52.211 --> 01:55:54.013
BEING ABLE TO HAVE THAT AS YOUR

01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:55.448
FIRST POINT OF CONTACT BE

01:55:55.515 --> 01:55:57.417
PROACTIVE KEEPING THOSE MEDS

01:55:57.483 --> 01:55:58.885
MOVING THROUGH THE HOSPITAL

01:55:58.951 --> 01:56:01.754
SERVES AS A LINE OF DEFENSE BUT

01:56:01.821 --> 01:56:04.424
TO THEN COUNT THEM AS RESOURCES

01:56:04.490 --> 01:56:05.958
A SERRA CASE SOMETHING HAPPENS.

01:56:06.025 --> 01:56:07.293
AND YET AND SOMEONE DOES PUSH

01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:09.028
THAT BUTTON AND TO SAY THEY'RE

01:56:09.095 --> 01:56:10.330
RESPONDING THEY HAVE TO KEEP AN

01:56:10.396 --> 01:56:12.498
EYE ON THAT THAT ROOM THAT'S

01:56:12.565 --> 01:56:12.732
THERE.

01:56:12.799 --> 01:56:13.933
SO I THINK.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.035
LOOKING AT AND SEEN THE BUDGET

01:56:16.102 --> 01:56:17.337
FOR OVERTIME I'D LIKE TO LEARN A

01:56:17.403 --> 01:56:19.372
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT IT IS

01:56:19.439 --> 01:56:21.341
A TRULY --

01:56:21.407 --> 01:56:23.376
VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY

01:56:23.443 --> 01:56:24.844
MANDATORY OVERTIME THAT'S COMING

01:56:24.911 --> 01:56:26.446
THERE AND IF THAT'S THE CASE

01:56:26.512 --> 01:56:28.581
DOES THAT PUT THE INDIVIDUALS --

01:56:28.648 --> 01:56:30.116
IN SOME TYPE OF HARM'S WAY

01:56:30.183 --> 01:56:32.785
BECAUSE THEIR THEIR WITS AND

01:56:32.852 --> 01:56:33.920
THINGS LIKE THAT NEED TO STILL

01:56:33.986 --> 01:56:35.621
BE INTACT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING

01:56:35.688 --> 01:56:39.425
THAT CLOSE TO A POPULATION.

01:56:39.492 --> 01:56:41.394
SO LOOKING AT THE THE THE

01:56:41.461 --> 01:56:43.663
OVERTIME THAT'S ASSUMED IN THE

01:56:43.730 --> 01:56:45.431

AROUND AREAS OF HOLIDAYS --

01:58:28.734 --> 01:58:29.769
OR IF THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT

01:58:29.836 --> 01:58:31.304
EVENT GOING ON IN THE COMMUNITY

01:58:31.370 --> 01:58:33.005
LIKE THE MID STATE FAIR GIVES US

01:58:33.072 --> 01:58:34.407
A LITTLE BIT OF OF CHALLENGE.

01:58:34.474 --> 01:58:36.809
OF THOSE TYPES OF TIME FRAMESOF

01:58:36.876 --> 01:58:38.578

HOURS ACROSS AS WELL SO BE MORE

01:58:49.288 --> 01:58:51.824
A A NURSES AVAILABLE TO WORK

01:58:51.891 --> 01:58:54.093
OVERTIME SHIFTS THE REASON I

01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:56.062
BRING IT UP IT IS BECAUSE ONE I

01:58:56.128 --> 01:58:57.129
THINK IT'S A DIFFERENT

01:58:57.196 --> 01:58:58.498
ATMOSPHERE --

01:58:58.564 --> 01:58:59.332
BEING THERE THAT IT'S A HIGH

01:58:59.398 --> 01:59:01.467
RISK HIGH RISK AREA HIGH RISK

01:59:01.534 --> 01:59:03.936
JOB THOSE THINGS DO HAPPEN --

01:59:04.003 --> 01:59:05.137
WHEN I TOURED --

01:59:05.204 --> 01:59:06.606
PENN STATE HOSPITAL I SEE ALL

01:59:06.672 --> 01:59:08.107
THESE THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING

01:59:08.174 --> 01:59:09.609
ABOUT AND AND PROBABLY.

01:59:09.675 --> 01:59:11.711

01:59:11.777 --> 01:59:14.480
WHEN I TOURED IT A SITE TECH WAS

01:59:14.547 --> 01:59:14.981
ATTACKED.

01:59:15.047 --> 01:59:16.849
SO THOSE ARE THE REASONS WHY I'M

01:59:16.916 --> 01:59:18.117
SAYING THAT THE SAFETY OF THOSE

01:59:18.184 --> 01:59:20.086
EMPLOYEES IS SOMETHING THAT WE

01:59:20.152 --> 01:59:21.821
SHOULD TAKE INTO OUR DISCUSSION

01:59:21.888 --> 01:59:22.655
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OVER

01:59:22.722 --> 01:59:24.557
TIME WHETHER IT'S VOLUNTARY OR

01:59:24.624 --> 01:59:25.758
MANDATORY.

01:59:25.825 --> 01:59:27.293
IS BECAUSE OF THIS THAT WE'VE

01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:30.763

ITSELF THIS PROPOSAL WANT

01:59:37.937 --> 01:59:39.972
NECESSARILY REDUCE MANDATORY

01:59:40.039 --> 01:59:42.141
OVERTIME THE ONLY WAY MANDATORY

01:59:42.208 --> 01:59:43.476
OVERTIME WOULD BE REDUCED AS IF

01:59:43.543 --> 01:59:44.810
THE POSITIONS ARE ACTUALLY

01:59:44.877 --> 01:59:45.478
FILLED.

01:59:45.545 --> 01:59:46.779
I THINK IT'S A FAIR POINT THAT

BY ADDING POSITIONS YOU MIGHT

01:59:48.414 --> 01:59:50.316

01:59:55.454 --> 01:59:56.055
FACT THAT.

01:59:56.122 --> 01:59:56.956
THE MAIN EFFECT WOULD COME FROM

01:59:57.023 --> 01:59:59.725
THE WORK FOR BECAUSE OF THAT WE

01:59:59.792 --> 02:00:00.793

SCHOOL.

02:15:59.718 --> 02:16:00.418
WAITING FOR THE RESIDENCY

02:16:00.485 --> 02:16:02.954
PLACEMENTS --

02:16:03.021 --> 02:16:04.456
20% OF THE PEOPLE GRADUATING

02:16:04.523 --> 02:16:06.057
FROM MEDICAL SCHOOL IN AMERICA

02:16:06.124 --> 02:16:06.958

02:16:07.025 --> 02:16:08.193

02:16:08.260 --> 02:16:10.595
SHORTAGE OF RESIDENCY SLOTS TO

BE TRAINED.

02:16:17.969 --> 02:16:19.004
SO WE NEED MORE RESIDENCY

02:16:19.070 --> 02:16:19.971
PROGRAMS.

02:16:20.038 --> 02:16:21.873

FRAZIER THANK YOU.

02:16:27.412 --> 02:16:29.314
AS A DAD THAT PAID FOR HIS

02:16:29.381 --> 02:16:31.950
DAUGHTER'S PSYCHOLOGY.

02:16:32.017 --> 02:16:33.618
OF EDUCATION AND HIGHER

02:16:33.685 --> 02:16:35.620
EDUCATION.

02:16:35.687 --> 02:16:38.690
AND STARTED OUR FORENSIC PATH

02:16:38.757 --> 02:16:40.125
AND SO WHAT THE PAY WAS.

02:16:40.191 --> 02:16:41.393
AND THEN WENT INTO PRIVATE

02:16:41.459 --> 02:16:42.794
BECAUSE OF SHE'S A CLINICAL

02:16:42.861 --> 02:16:44.429
PSYCHOLOGIST.

02:16:44.496 --> 02:16:45.864
SHORT MEMORIAL HOSPITAL --

02:16:45.931 --> 02:16:47.799
IN SAN DIEGO I THINK THAT WE

02:16:47.866 --> 02:16:49.501
ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE PAY

02:16:49.568 --> 02:16:50.068
DISPARITY BETWEEN PRIDE IN

02:16:50.135 --> 02:16:51.703
PUBLIC --

02:16:51.770 --> 02:16:53.204
THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED.

02:16:53.271 --> 02:16:54.139
WHEN WE LOOK IN --

02:16:54.205 --> 02:16:55.373
HELP THE PRIVATE SECTOR'S

02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:57.709
ADVANCED AND IT'S NOT A FAIR

02:16:57.776 --> 02:17:00.879
ASSUMPTION THAT ANYBODY WANTS TO

02:17:00.946 --> 02:17:02.113
GO AND MAKE LESS.

02:17:02.180 --> 02:17:03.715
IN AN INDUSTRY THAT REALLY DOES

02:17:03.782 --> 02:17:06.751
TAKE A DEDICATED INDIVIDUAL --

02:17:06.818 --> 02:17:10.622
MAKING A LIFE BASICALLY THAT

02:17:10.689 --> 02:17:12.357
THEY'RE GOING TO HELP PEOPLE

02:17:12.424 --> 02:17:15.026
WITH THESE INDIVIDUAL PROBLEMS.

02:17:15.093 --> 02:17:16.661
YOU KNOW WE KEEP DODGING THE

02:17:16.728 --> 02:17:18.096
ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM.

02:17:18.163 --> 02:17:20.565
WE DON'T PAY ENOUGH.

02:17:20.632 --> 02:17:22.534
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADMIRE

02:17:22.601 --> 02:17:24.336
THESE FOLKS TO TAKE THIS THIS

02:17:24.402 --> 02:17:25.770
PART OF THE POPULATION.

02:17:25.837 --> 02:17:27.138
THE NOBODY WANTS TO HAVE

02:17:27.205 --> 02:17:28.139
DEALINGS WITH WHAT I'VE GONE

02:17:28.206 --> 02:17:30.909
THROUGH CMF AND BACK OF BILL --

02:17:30.976 --> 02:17:32.143
WHICH IS ANOTHER SUBSET OF WHAT

02:17:32.210 --> 02:17:33.411
YOU WOULD WHAT WE'RE TALKING

02:17:33.478 --> 02:17:36.214
ABOUT THE CRIMINALLY INSANE.

02:17:36.281 --> 02:17:37.649
NOBODY WANTS TO BE THERE.

02:17:37.716 --> 02:17:40.819
BUT THE FOLKS THAT YOU WORK WITH.

02:17:40.885 --> 02:17:43.054
GOD LOVE THEM ARE DOING IT.

02:17:43.121 --> 02:17:44.089
WE GOT A KNOWLEDGE IF WE WANNA

02:17:44.155 --> 02:17:46.057
TAKE.

02:17:46.124 --> 02:17:47.025
YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THE

02:17:47.092 --> 02:17:49.461
POPULATION CENSUS GROWING.

02:17:49.527 --> 02:17:51.296
BUT OUR EMPLOYMENT RATE NOBODY

02:17:51.363 --> 02:17:53.264
WANTS TO DO IT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

02:17:53.331 --> 02:17:54.766
PAYING ENOUGH HI MY SOMETHING

02:17:54.833 --> 02:17:56.434
LIKE A BROKEN RECORD.

02:17:56.501 --> 02:17:59.504
BUT IT IS IT IS THE TRUTH --

02:17:59.571 --> 02:18:00.138
AND AGAIN MY DAUGHTER IS ONE OF

02:18:00.205 --> 02:18:02.741
THE FOREMOST FACTORS SHE JUST

02:18:02.807 --> 02:18:04.743
HAS A SOCIETY SHE CAN'T SHE

02:18:04.809 --> 02:18:04.976
CAN'T --

02:18:05.043 --> 02:18:06.244
PRESCRIBE.

02:18:06.311 --> 02:18:08.346
BUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:18:08.413 --> 02:18:09.814
DOLLARS IN HER EDUCATION SHE

02:18:09.881 --> 02:18:11.416
WENT TO A PRIVATE UNIVERSITY.

02:18:11.483 --> 02:18:12.951
OF NOT TORO BUT SHE WENT TO

02:18:13.018 --> 02:18:13.985
ALLIANCE.

02:18:14.052 --> 02:18:15.286
I THINK WE DON'T NEED TO

02:18:15.353 --> 02:18:18.056
ALIENATE ANY PSYCHOLOGY SCHOOL

02:18:18.123 --> 02:18:19.524
ALSO WE NEED TO BE ABLE.

02:18:19.591 --> 02:18:20.792
TO ALLOW IN.

02:18:20.859 --> 02:18:23.128
ANY KIND OF SPECIAL WE CAN GET

02:18:23.194 --> 02:18:25.630
OF BECAUSE IT'S NOT A SUBSET OF

02:18:25.697 --> 02:18:29.801
THE SCOPE THAT ANYBODY WANTS.

02:18:29.868 --> 02:18:30.468
TO JUST JUMP INTO UNLESS THERE'S

02:18:30.535 --> 02:18:31.970
SOME PUT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE

02:18:32.037 --> 02:18:33.405
MONEY -- SO

02:18:33.471 --> 02:18:34.739
I HOPE WE'VE BECOME MORE

02:18:34.806 --> 02:18:35.874
COMPETITIVE.

02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:38.877
AND UNDERSTAND THAT --

02:18:38.943 --> 02:18:40.311
IT'S EVEN WITH OUR STAFF HERE IN

02:18:40.378 --> 02:18:41.479
THE BUILDING.

02:18:41.546 --> 02:18:42.714
THEY WORK A FEW YEARS AND THEY

02:18:42.781 --> 02:18:44.549
GO OUT OF HER HOUSE.

02:18:44.616 --> 02:18:46.518
BECAUSE THEY MAKE MORE MONEY.

02:18:46.584 --> 02:18:47.018
YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO BE

02:18:47.085 --> 02:18:47.952
COMPETITIVE.

02:18:48.019 --> 02:18:49.788
AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE

02:18:49.854 --> 02:18:51.256
THAT IN AND LOOKING TO HAVE A

02:18:51.322 --> 02:18:53.558
STUDY DONE WHAT'S DISPARITY IN

02:18:53.625 --> 02:18:54.592
PAY.

02:18:54.659 --> 02:18:55.927
AND AND IF THERE IS SOME KIND OF

02:18:55.994 --> 02:18:58.229
A COULD WEEK EQUITY WE CAN BUILD

02:18:58.296 --> 02:19:00.365
THE WE NEED TO DO THAT.

02:19:00.432 --> 02:19:01.700
THE COST MONEY BUT WE'RE ALSO

02:19:01.766 --> 02:19:03.334
GONNA HAVE A QUALITY OF CARE

02:19:03.401 --> 02:19:03.535
THAT.

02:19:03.601 --> 02:19:07.672
WE CAN BE PROUD OF THANK YOU

02:19:07.739 --> 02:19:07.972
[inaudible]

02:19:08.039 --> 02:19:09.574
SOME.

02:19:09.641 --> 02:19:11.009
I HAD MY TWO CENTS AND MAYBE

02:19:11.076 --> 02:19:12.811
IT'S BECAUSE I STAYED IN THE

02:19:12.877 --> 02:19:14.379
SAME COUNTY WHERE I DID MY

02:19:14.446 --> 02:19:15.613
RESIDENCY.

02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:17.816
BUT TRAINING PEOPLE OFTEN TIMES

02:19:17.882 --> 02:19:19.451
LEADS TOWARDS THEM WANTING TO

02:19:19.517 --> 02:19:20.418
STAY.

02:19:20.485 --> 02:19:22.087
I THINK HISTORICALLY THE DATA IS

02:19:22.153 --> 02:19:24.155
ABOUT 50% DEPENDING ON THE

02:19:24.222 --> 02:19:25.156
SPECIALTY.

02:19:25.223 --> 02:19:28.159
AND EVEN ATTAINING THAT AMOUNT

02:19:28.226 --> 02:19:30.328
OF IMMEDIATE PARTICIPATION OF

02:19:30.395 --> 02:19:31.629
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS

02:19:31.696 --> 02:19:33.231
SAYING WALL THERE RESIDENTS AND

02:19:33.298 --> 02:19:35.867
THE OPPORTUNITY TO CAPTURE THEM.

02:19:35.934 --> 02:19:37.669
AND HAVE THEM STAY LONG TERM IS

02:19:37.736 --> 02:19:39.404
A STRONG REASON TO MAKE THIS

CLARIFY THAT PATIENTS WHO ARE

02:24:59.090 --> 02:25:00.958
THE GENDER DID ASK US TO ANSWER

02:25:01.025 --> 02:25:03.661

HOLD FOR C. WITH THOSE.

02:25:05.029 --> 02:25:07.765
AS PER THE FIRST ONE WAS FOR

02:25:07.832 --> 02:25:09.500
WHAT REASONS DOES I AM DAZED --

02:25:09.567 --> 02:25:11.135
THE DEPARTMENT NOT WANT TO PAY

02:25:11.202 --> 02:25:12.537
PATIENT WORKERS MINIMUM WAGE

02:25:12.603 --> 02:25:13.638
WE'RE ACTUALLY ALREADY

02:25:13.704 --> 02:25:15.540
AUTHORIZED TO UNDER THE FEDERAL

02:25:19.777 --> 02:25:20.978
AND IN THE SHELTERED WORKSHOPS

02:25:21.045 --> 02:25:23.614
UNDER THE FOURTEENTH HEY SUB

02:25:23.681 --> 02:25:25.216
MINIMUM WAGE --

02:25:25.283 --> 02:25:26.184
WE COULD CREATE SHELTERED

02:25:26.250 --> 02:25:27.585

02:25:32.256 --> 02:25:33.524
MINIMUM WAGE.

02:25:33.591 --> 02:25:35.193
BUT IT IS A RESOURCE INTENSIVE

02:25:35.259 --> 02:25:36.961
AS I MENTIONED IT WOULD REQUIRE

02:25:37.028 --> 02:25:38.296
THAT WE DO STUDIES OF FOR EVERY

02:25:41.699 --> 02:25:43.234
SO OUR PROPOSAL IS TO PAY

02:25:43.301 --> 02:25:44.869

02:25:44.936 --> 02:25:47.705
FACTORS SUCH AS COST AS WELL AS

02:25:47.772 --> 02:25:49.340

CALIFORNIA WE WANT TO THANK THE

02:28:53.557 --> 02:28:54.959
DEPARTMENT FOR RECOGNIZING I

02:28:55.026 --> 02:28:56.227
THINK WHAT WE SAW SOME

02:28:56.294 --> 02:28:58.496
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS WITH THE

02:28:58.562 --> 02:29:00.965
THE DISPARATE WAGES THAT HAVE

02:29:01.032 --> 02:29:02.466
BEEN PAID IN THE PAST AND THE

02:29:02.533 --> 02:29:03.901
AMOUNTS OF THAT SO WE THINK THIS

02:29:03.968 --> 02:29:05.903
IS A SIGNIFICANT STEP --

02:29:05.970 --> 02:29:07.672
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE WOULD

02:29:07.738 --> 02:29:09.340
JUST RAISE I THINK THREE

02:29:09.407 --> 02:29:10.775
CONCERNS ABOUT THAT --

02:29:10.841 --> 02:29:12.443
THAT HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED ONE ONE

02:29:12.510 --> 02:29:15.246
IS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT --

02:29:15.313 --> 02:29:17.748
THE RACED TO THE MINIMUM WAGE

02:29:17.815 --> 02:29:18.883
SHOULD NOT BE THE FEDERAL

02:29:18.949 --> 02:29:20.518
MINIMUM WAGE BUT SHOULD BE TO

02:29:20.584 --> 02:29:21.919
THE STATEMENT MINIMUM WAGE

02:29:21.986 --> 02:29:23.321
RECOGNIZING THE VALUE OF THE

02:29:23.387 --> 02:29:24.622
SERVICES.

02:29:24.689 --> 02:29:25.756
THAT -- THE

02:29:25.823 --> 02:29:29.260
PATIENTS ARE SECOND AS YOU --

02:29:29.327 --> 02:29:31.896
AS YOU HEARD THERE IS --

02:29:31.962 --> 02:29:33.831
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR LIMITATION

02:29:33.898 --> 02:29:35.466
NOW THAT THE WAGE ON THE THAT

02:29:35.533 --> 02:29:37.234
CAN BE KEPT IN THE ACCOUNT NOW

02:29:37.301 --> 02:29:38.969
THAT OF THE WAGES HAVE BEEN

02:29:39.036 --> 02:29:40.304
INCREASED.

02:29:40.371 --> 02:29:41.972
WE'RE SUGGESTING THAT THAT BE

02:29:42.039 --> 02:29:44.041
INCREASED TO AT LEAST A THOUSAND

02:29:44.108 --> 02:29:45.509
DOLLARS --

02:29:45.576 --> 02:29:47.144
AND THAT SERVES I THINK THE

02:29:47.211 --> 02:29:48.379
IMPORTANT PURPOSE THE DEPARTMENT

02:29:48.446 --> 02:29:50.381
WAS MENTIONING THAT --

02:29:50.448 --> 02:29:52.216
IT EASES RE ENTRY FOR THOSE

02:29:52.283 --> 02:29:53.684
PATIENTS THAT'D BE LEAVING AND

02:29:53.751 --> 02:29:56.954
HOPEFULLY REDUCING RECIDIVISM --

02:29:57.021 --> 02:29:58.089
AS WELL.

02:29:58.155 --> 02:30:01.392
AND THE FINALLY THERE THERE ARE

02:30:01.459 --> 02:30:03.761
I THINK ABOUT STE NINETY SIX

02:30:03.828 --> 02:30:05.363
WORKERS THAT HAVE BEEN GETTING

02:30:05.429 --> 02:30:07.531
THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE --

02:30:07.598 --> 02:30:08.599
THAT WE THINK THIS PROPOSAL

02:30:08.666 --> 02:30:10.334
WOULD ACTUALLY REDUCE THEIR

02:30:10.401 --> 02:30:12.336
MINIMUM WAGE TO THE STATE

02:30:12.403 --> 02:30:13.771
MINIMUM WAGE AND THAT THOSE

02:30:13.838 --> 02:30:15.506
INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE --

02:30:15.573 --> 02:30:17.441

02:30:33.858 --> 02:30:36.427
WORKERS COOPERATE. FOR THE HAS

02:30:36.494 --> 02:30:37.027

HAVE NEVER HAD A CLAIM THAT

02:30:46.537 --> 02:30:47.838
WE'RE AWARE OF THE FROM OUR

02:30:47.905 --> 02:30:49.774
PATIENTS WHILE THEY DO QUALIFY

02:30:49.840 --> 02:30:51.242
FOR WORKERS COMP WE HAVEN'T HAD

02:30:51.308 --> 02:30:53.677

WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE

02:30:59.850 --> 02:31:00.818
PATIENT'S.

02:31:00.885 --> 02:31:02.353
GOING OUT WITH A REHABILITATION

02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:03.921
PROGRAM HOW MUCH THE STATE IS

02:31:03.988 --> 02:31:07.358
SPENT IN THEIR IN THEIR CARE

02:31:07.425 --> 02:31:07.725
COMPARATIVELY --

02:31:07.792 --> 02:31:09.326
SO.

02:31:09.393 --> 02:31:10.828
AS OF THE GERMAN JUST POINTED

02:31:10.895 --> 02:31:12.096
OUT WEEK YOU KNOW WANTING TO

02:31:12.163 --> 02:31:13.097
MAKE SURE THAT.

02:31:13.164 --> 02:31:14.565
WE'RE GETTING STATE MINIMUM WAGE

02:31:14.632 --> 02:31:15.900
BUT HOW MUCH OF THAT HAS THE

02:31:15.966 --> 02:31:18.235
STATE PAID FOR THE

02:31:18.302 --> 02:31:20.671
REHABILITATION UP TO THAT POINT.

02:31:20.738 --> 02:31:23.407
OF FOR THE WAGES. ONE OF THEIR

02:31:23.474 --> 02:31:26.110
CARE. FOR THE CARE THE TOTAL

02:31:26.177 --> 02:31:28.012
COST OF CARE FOR A PATIENT AND

02:31:28.078 --> 02:31:29.113
WITHIN OUR STATE HOSPITALS

02:31:29.180 --> 02:31:31.515
AVERAGES ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND

02:31:31.582 --> 02:31:32.650
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER

02:31:32.716 --> 02:31:34.952
YEAR AND WHO PAYS FOR THAT --

02:31:35.019 --> 02:31:36.554
THIS THE GENERAL FUND

02:31:36.620 --> 02:31:36.854
[inaudible]

02:31:36.921 --> 02:31:37.988
OKAY SO.

02:31:38.055 --> 02:31:40.991
THEY'VE BEEN REHABILITATED TO A

02:31:41.058 --> 02:31:41.192
WITH.

02:31:41.258 --> 02:31:44.161
TAXPAYER MONEY.

02:31:44.228 --> 02:31:45.463
AND THEN PUT WE'RE GONNA PAY

02:31:45.529 --> 02:31:47.198
THEM.

02:31:47.264 --> 02:31:48.399
MINIMUM WAGE TO CONTINUE THAT

02:31:48.466 --> 02:31:50.167
PROCESS.

02:31:50.234 --> 02:31:52.436
SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS I MEAN I

02:31:52.503 --> 02:31:53.037
THINK THAT THERE'S A POINT IN

02:31:53.103 --> 02:31:55.272
TIME THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

02:31:55.339 --> 02:31:56.307
RETURN OUR DOLLAR.

02:31:56.373 --> 02:31:57.608
TO AS AN INVESTMENT ON THE

02:31:57.675 --> 02:31:59.143
REHABILITATION.

02:31:59.210 --> 02:32:02.079
SO HOW DO WE COULD WE I I KNOW

02:32:02.146 --> 02:32:03.047
THEY HAVE A VALUE.

02:32:03.113 --> 02:32:04.448
AND AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT

02:32:04.515 --> 02:32:06.817
THEY'RE NOT WORTH.

02:32:06.884 --> 02:32:09.653
IN WAYS BUT BACK SOMEDAY

02:32:09.720 --> 02:32:09.954
[inaudible]

02:32:10.020 --> 02:32:12.823
THE TAXPAYER.

02:32:12.890 --> 02:32:16.260
AS WE KEEP A YEAH I THINK THE

02:32:16.327 --> 02:32:17.895
GOAL OF A REHABILITATION

02:32:17.962 --> 02:32:20.431
PROGRAMS IS TO ENSURE THAT WHEN

02:32:20.498 --> 02:32:22.800
PATIENTS DO LEAVE OUR HOSPITAL

02:32:22.867 --> 02:32:24.768
THAT THEY HAVE THE SKILLS TO BE

02:32:24.835 --> 02:32:26.337
ABLE TO RAIMES IT IS
