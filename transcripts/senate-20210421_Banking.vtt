TRYING TO- I DONT CHANGES THAT

00:31:01.993 --> 00:31:03.061
WERE SUGGESTED TO TRY TO NARROW

00:31:03.127 --> 00:31:04.362
THE SCOPE TO TRY TO PREVENT HIS

00:31:04.429 --> 00:31:06.731
BILL FROM BEING OVERLY ONEROUS-

00:31:06.798 --> 00:31:08.666
IN THE OPERATIONS OF BUSINESSES

00:31:08.733 --> 00:31:10.568
BUT- A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

00:31:10.635 --> 00:31:11.903
DOLLARS IN REVENUE IS NOT. A

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:13.171
LOT OF COMPANIES AND I WOULD

00:31:13.238 --> 00:31:15.640
JUST POINT OUT THAT THAT'S- A

00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:16.841
VERY HIGH THRESHOLD THE MEDIA

00:31:16.908 --> 00:31:18.042
AND I'D I GUESS MY FIRST

00:31:18.109 --> 00:31:19.677
QUESTION FOR THE SENATOR- WOULD

00:31:19.744 --> 00:31:24.382
BE HOW MANY COMPANIES. DOESN'T

00:31:24.449 --> 00:31:25.116
ACTUALLY COVER IN CALIFORNIA.

MORNING FROM THE FRANCHISE TAX

00:31:35.526 --> 00:31:38.930
BOARD THE ESTIMATES ARE THAT

00:31:38.997 --> 00:31:41.432
ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED- ENTITIES IN

00:31:41.499 --> 00:31:43.668
THE STATE. ROSS SOME OF THE

00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:45.703
INSTITUTIONS WE DISCUSSED BUT-

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:47.405
WITH WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT

00:31:47.472 --> 00:31:48.706
WERE CONTEMPLATING ALSO WITH

00:31:48.773 --> 00:31:50.875
THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WE THINK

00:31:50.942 --> 00:31:52.510
THAT NUMBER WOULD ACTUALLY GO.

00:31:52.577 --> 00:31:54.512
DOWN EVEN FURTHER AND THEN WITH

00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:55.280
THE AMENDMENTS WE WANT TO

00:31:55.346 --> 00:31:57.482
COMMIT TO TODAY WITH THE

00:31:57.548 --> 00:31:59.350

00:31:59.417 --> 00:32:02.620
GOES DOWN FURTHER STILL SO.

00:32:02.687 --> 00:32:03.721

SURPRISED TO SEE THEM IN

00:32:11.296 --> 00:32:12.697
OPPOSITION BECAUSE I THINK WITH

00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:14.098
THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR

00:32:14.165 --> 00:32:16.267
REVENUES THRESHOLD. TO BE CLEAR

00:32:16.334 --> 00:32:18.102

HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN

00:32:21.205 --> 00:32:23.041

TALKED WITH SENATOR STERN I

00:33:23.101 --> 00:33:24.369
KNOW THAT HE IS CONSIDERING

00:33:24.435 --> 00:33:26.804
WAYS TO AMEND THE BILL. TO

00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:27.805

KNOW I CAN FIND MYSELF IN THE

00:40:34.799 --> 00:40:36.033
CATEGORY OF OPPOSE UNLESS

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.402
AMENDED ON THIS BILL BECAUSE OF

00:40:38.469 --> 00:40:40.437
JUST SIMPLY THE CIRCUMSTANCES

00:40:40.504 --> 00:40:41.639
UNDER WHICH THE BILL IS GOING

00:40:41.705 --> 00:40:43.607
TO BE IS BEING PROPOSED MORE

00:40:43.674 --> 00:40:45.075
THAN ANYTHING ELSE. I MEAN

00:40:45.142 --> 00:40:48.112
RIGHT NOW OF THE EXPECTATIONS

00:40:48.179 --> 00:40:49.413
THAT WASHINGTON WILL DO SOME ON

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:53.184
THIS WE KNOW THAT. SOMETIMES

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:53.784
THINGS COME OUT OF WASHINGTON

00:40:53.851 --> 00:40:56.520
SOMETIMES THEY DON'T. AND

00:40:56.587 --> 00:40:58.722
REFORMS SUCH AS THIS OFTEN TAKE

00:40:58.789 --> 00:41:01.892
YEARS- THE LAST ADMINISTRATION

00:41:01.959 --> 00:41:03.527
I MEAN I REMEMBER THE OBAMA

00:41:03.594 --> 00:41:04.795
ADMINISTRATION TOOK ABOUT SIX

00:41:04.862 --> 00:41:05.596
YEARS TO COME UP WITH THE

00:41:05.663 --> 00:41:08.232
TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY THAT

00:41:08.299 --> 00:41:12.069
THAT WAS AN- OVERTURNED. BY- BY

00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:14.839
TRUMP. AND SO WHAT KIND OF THE

00:41:14.905 --> 00:41:17.274
YOU KNOW WORK FOR WE'RE BACK TO

00:41:17.341 --> 00:41:18.509
WHERE WE STARTED FROM ON THAT

00:41:18.576 --> 00:41:20.811
SIDE SO. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS

00:41:20.878 --> 00:41:22.646
IS COMING AS A PRESIDENTIAL.

00:41:22.713 --> 00:41:25.382
ORDER OR IF THE SCREEN COMES

00:41:25.449 --> 00:41:26.016
LEGISLATION BUT THAT COULD TAKE

00:41:26.083 --> 00:41:28.786
YEARS. SO I HAVE THAT CONCERN

00:41:28.853 --> 00:41:30.020
ABOUT WHETHER WE'RE TRYING TO

00:41:30.087 --> 00:41:33.190
OF. ANTICIPATE SOMETHING IS

00:41:33.257 --> 00:41:34.191
GOING TO COME OUT OF WASHINGTON

00:41:34.258 --> 00:41:36.460
SO IF NOTHING COMES OUT OF

00:41:36.527 --> 00:41:37.194
WASHINGTON AT THIS BILL MOVES

00:41:37.261 --> 00:41:39.029
FORWARD ONLY OUR STATE

00:41:39.096 --> 00:41:41.265
CHARTERED BANKS WOULD HAVE THAT

00:41:41.332 --> 00:41:42.933
REQUIREMENT BUT FOR ONE SMALL

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.668
AND ONE EVEN MEDICAL OR STATE

00:41:44.735 --> 00:41:47.037
OR STATE. CHARTERED BANKS AND I

00:41:47.104 --> 00:41:48.706
JUST DON'T SEE REALLY WHAT THE

00:41:48.772 --> 00:41:50.708
PURPOSE OF THAT IS IN THIS

00:41:50.774 --> 00:41:52.509
LEGISLATION AND THEN IF YOU

00:41:52.576 --> 00:41:55.279
COMPOUND THAT WITH THE PANDEMIC

00:41:55.346 --> 00:41:56.647
AND A STRUGGLING ECONOMY. AND

00:41:56.714 --> 00:42:00.317
EVERYTHING ELSE- THAT THAT THAT

00:42:00.384 --> 00:42:02.219
MAKES ME MORE WORRIED THAT WERE

00:42:02.286 --> 00:42:03.754
PUSHING LEGISLATION THAT COULD-

00:42:03.821 --> 00:42:07.858
THE- HELLO HURT INDUSTRIES THAT

00:42:07.925 --> 00:42:10.361
ARE ALREADY SUFFERING SO I HAVE

00:42:10.427 --> 00:42:12.162
OF THAT THAT ADDITIONAL CONCERN

00:42:12.229 --> 00:42:14.632
I ALWAYS OF ERROR IN IN THE

00:42:14.698 --> 00:42:16.533
DIRECTION OF MORE TRANSPARENCY

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.269
MORE INFORMATION EXPOSING MORE

00:42:18.335 --> 00:42:20.905
INFORMATION OF PUBLIC I THINK

00:42:20.971 --> 00:42:21.505
THAT'S A GOOD ELEMENT TO THIS

00:42:21.572 --> 00:42:24.375
BILL BUT- BUT SELECTIVELY.

00:42:24.441 --> 00:42:26.076
ASSIGNING THIS LAW TO ONLY A

00:42:26.143 --> 00:42:27.811
VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF THE

00:42:27.878 --> 00:42:29.313
CORPORATIONS I JUST DON'T SEE

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:32.082
THE BENEFIT IN THAT. BUT I

00:42:32.149 --> 00:42:33.117
DON'T KNOW WHAT I'LL DO TODAY

00:42:33.183 --> 00:42:34.585
I'M STILL THINKING ABOUT THIS I

00:42:34.652 --> 00:42:36.086
THINK MORE THAN LIKELY I THINK

00:42:36.153 --> 00:42:37.655
I WANT TO SUPPORT MY COLLEAGUES

00:42:37.721 --> 00:42:39.523
TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS.

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:41.458
AND MAY BE- YOU CAN GET THIS

00:42:41.525 --> 00:42:43.594
BILL IN A BETTER FORM. OF

00:42:43.661 --> 00:42:46.030
ENCOURAGED BY- THE OPPOSITION

00:42:46.096 --> 00:42:48.198
TALKING ABOUT HOW THE MEMBER IS

00:42:48.265 --> 00:42:49.633
ACCESSIBLE AND WORKING WITH

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.568
THEM THROUGH THIS AND- I HOPE

00:42:51.635 --> 00:42:53.504
SOMETHING. GOOD COMES OUT OF

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:55.172
THIS IN A IN A WAY THAT. CAN

00:42:55.239 --> 00:42:56.874
AND MAYBE THE AUTHOR SHOULD

00:42:56.941 --> 00:42:59.209
CONSIDER- WAITING FOR SOMETHING

00:42:59.276 --> 00:43:00.244
TO COME OUT OF WASHINGTON SO

00:43:00.311 --> 00:43:02.112
THAT WHEN WE TO PASS A LAW THAT

00:43:02.179 --> 00:43:05.716
WOULD IT. ALIGNS ALL BANKS.

00:43:05.783 --> 00:43:08.786
WITH WITH FEDERAL LEGISLATION.

00:43:08.852 --> 00:43:10.621
AS LONG AS FEDERAL AS THE

00:43:10.688 --> 00:43:11.455
LEGISLATION IS IN PLACE I THINK

00:43:11.522 --> 00:43:13.757
THAT'S- WHEN WE REALLY NEED TO

00:43:13.824 --> 00:43:16.760
CREATE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD.

EVERYTHING HE SAID HE HE LOOKED

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:34.091
AT MY NOTES AND JUST READ THEM

00:46:34.158 --> 00:46:35.926
AS- A MONSTER SO I REALLY

00:46:35.993 --> 00:46:37.694

THAT THE BILL IS IN RIGHT NOW I

00:46:47.538 --> 00:46:48.472

ANALYSIS AND I THINK THERE IS

00:47:05.255 --> 00:47:08.926
QUESTION ABOUT. HOW ENFORCEABLE

00:47:08.992 --> 00:47:11.495
THIS IS SPECIFICALLY IF. THE

00:47:11.562 --> 00:47:13.163
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES ACT

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:14.398
WHICH I THINK THE POINT HAS

00:47:14.464 --> 00:47:15.933
BEEN MADE WERE NOT CLEAR. THE

00:47:15.999 --> 00:47:17.401
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL ACT

00:47:17.467 --> 00:47:18.669
THEY'RE HAVING CONVERSATIONS

00:47:18.735 --> 00:47:20.337
ABOUT THIS- AND CERTAINLY WE

00:47:20.404 --> 00:47:22.372
WANT THIS TO BE. AN EFFECTIVE

00:47:22.439 --> 00:47:24.374
TOOL- THAT CAN HELP CALIFORNIA

00:47:24.441 --> 00:47:26.343
LEARN ABOUT WHAT ARE THOSE. I

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:28.712
RISK ASSESSMENTS- I OFTEN IN IN

00:47:28.779 --> 00:47:31.882
MY YOU KNOW PRIOR A- CAREER TO

00:47:31.949 --> 00:47:33.183
TALKED ABOUT TO EAT IT'S NOT

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:34.585
ENOUGH TO COLLECT DATA IF YOU

00:47:34.651 --> 00:47:35.619
DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE GONNA USE

00:47:35.686 --> 00:47:37.521
THAT DATA. AND SO I THINK WE

00:47:37.588 --> 00:47:39.389
WANT TO ALSO UNDERSTAND WHAT

00:47:39.456 --> 00:47:42.960

00:47:43.026 --> 00:47:44.895
PERHAPS. HOW WE WILL BE ABLE TO

00:47:44.962 --> 00:47:47.364

00:47:47.431 --> 00:47:48.498
THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE

00:47:48.565 --> 00:47:50.634

IN THAT WE CAN BRING YOU

00:50:11.341 --> 00:50:12.175

PRODUCT ON THE FLOOR THAT.

00:50:13.877 --> 00:50:17.180
REPRESENTS A STEP FORWARD AND

00:50:17.247 --> 00:50:19.149
SOMETHING IT'S NOT JUST A PIECE

00:50:19.216 --> 00:50:20.984
OF PAPER BUT THAT ACTUALLY DOES

00:50:21.051 --> 00:50:22.519
SET THE STANDARD BUT AT THE

SAME TIME- I DOESN'T DEFERRED

00:50:25.455 --> 00:50:28.091
IT TO WASHINGTON AND- TO ACT I

01:20:04.299 --> 01:20:07.836
AND SO THAT- IN IN COMBINATION

01:20:07.903 --> 01:20:09.504
WITH PACES REALLY HELP TO GET

01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:11.206
THIS PROGRAMS TAKE OFF BUT-

01:20:11.273 --> 01:20:13.575
NOW. OFTENTIMES WITH PACE THERE

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:15.677
ARE SOMETIMES CONSUMERS THAT

01:20:15.744 --> 01:20:19.414
ARE. I LEFT WITH A VERY VERY

01:20:19.481 --> 01:20:20.916
BIG DEBTS THAT OFTEN INVOLVES

01:20:20.982 --> 01:20:24.252
TURF. FIRST TO SAVE WATER AND

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:26.488
SHOULDERS TO SAVE ENERGY SO.

01:20:26.555 --> 01:20:29.124
I'D LIKE TO IN IN MOVING

01:20:29.191 --> 01:20:29.724
FORWARD WITH THIS I'D LIKE TO

01:20:29.791 --> 01:20:31.159
OFFER TO CONSIDER. THAT IN SOME

01:20:31.226 --> 01:20:37.132
LANGUAGE THAT WOULD- AGAIN- I

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:39.201
THINK HAVING THIS ASSESSMENT IS

01:20:39.267 --> 01:20:41.269
GOING TO HELP OF. TECH

01:20:41.336 --> 01:20:43.004
CONSUMERS FROM HAVING TO-

01:20:43.071 --> 01:20:44.172
PURCHASE MORE THAN THEY

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:45.473
ACTUALLY NEED AND I THINK IT'S

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:47.742
IMPORTANT AT HOME HOMES BE.

01:20:47.809 --> 01:20:49.044
SELF SUFFICIENT THAT THEY DON'T

01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:51.413
GET SOLD ON THE PANELS ONE OF

01:20:51.479 --> 01:20:52.214
THE THINGS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:54.149
TO THE THIS IS THAT THEY'RE

01:20:54.216 --> 01:20:56.351
SOLD PANELS THAT EXCEED. THE

01:20:56.418 --> 01:20:58.520
LIMITS BEYOND WHAT THE HOME

01:20:58.587 --> 01:21:00.855
ACTUALLY NEEDS. AND I DON'T

01:21:00.922 --> 01:21:02.190
THINK THAT WAS EVER REALLY

01:21:02.257 --> 01:21:04.192
ENVISION ANY KIND OF PROGRAM

01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:06.728
WITH THE STATE. AND OFTEN TIMES

01:21:06.795 --> 01:21:08.163
THE COST OF THAT IS MUCH HIGHER

01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:09.764
THAN A PANEL THAT ACTUALLY

01:21:09.831 --> 01:21:12.000
SUSTAIN THE HOME. AND IT'LL

01:21:12.067 --> 01:21:14.936
SERVE EVERYONE A LOT BETTER TO

01:21:15.003 --> 01:21:17.239
MAKE SURE THAT EACH HOME IS

01:21:17.305 --> 01:21:19.975
SELF SUFFICIENT. AND AND- AS

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:21.109
AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:21:21.176 --> 01:21:22.510

SUBSIDIZED TO SOMETHING THAT.

01:21:30.318 --> 01:21:30.852

HOMEOWNER WITH A- BIGGER BILL

01:21:33.154 --> 01:21:36.391

STATE WHAT THEY NEED AND NOT

01:21:57.545 --> 01:21:59.581
MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE IT HAS

01:21:59.648 --> 01:22:01.349
AN OVERALL COSTS IN THE ENTIRE

01:22:01.416 --> 01:22:03.718

SUGGESTION YOU MADE WHICH IS

01:22:43.391 --> 01:22:44.492
SIMILAR TO SUITABILITY

ASSESSMENTS AND OTHER TYPES OF

01:22:46.027 --> 01:22:47.595
CONSUMER LENDING. WOULD

01:22:47.662 --> 01:22:49.230
ABSOLUTELY BE APPROPRIATE AND I

WE'RE TRYING TO GET THIS RIGHT-

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:56.771
WE DON'T WANT TO KILL THE PACE

REGULATION HERE BUT CLEARLY

01:23:00.675 --> 01:23:03.478
SOME LEVEL OF REFORM IS NEEDED-

01:23:05.213 --> 01:23:06.047
WOULD BENEFIT FROM YOUR

01:23:06.114 --> 01:23:07.615
EXPERTISE AND IT'S A GREAT

01:23:07.682 --> 01:23:08.950
SUGGESTION THE MAIN ONE THAT WE

01:23:09.017 --> 01:23:09.918
WOULD LIKE TO. WORK WITH YOU

01:23:09.984 --> 01:23:13.021

01:23:26.034 --> 01:23:27.869
THAT I WISH OF PERSONAL ONE

01:23:27.936 --> 01:23:30.538
SIZE FITS ALL DOESN'T WORK IN

01:23:30.605 --> 01:23:31.673
IN CALIFORNIA HAS AS MANY

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:33.708
PEOPLE KNOW THAT. THIS IS THE

01:23:33.775 --> 01:23:36.044
LARGEST GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRICT

01:23:36.111 --> 01:23:36.611
IN THE STATE WITH VERY POOR

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:39.614
PEOPLE. SO I DON'T I WANT YOU

01:23:39.681 --> 01:23:41.416
TO DRESS TO ISSUES THAT I THINK

01:23:41.483 --> 01:23:42.250
WILL BE REALLY CRITICAL FIRST

01:23:42.317 --> 01:23:44.152
OF ALL I HATE THE FACT THAT WE

01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:45.253
HAVE PEOPLE WHO FRAUD OTHER

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:46.888
PEOPLE JUST IT'S FRUSTRATING

01:23:46.955 --> 01:23:47.555
AND ONE THING ABOUT THIS

01:23:47.622 --> 01:23:49.224
COMMITTEE THAT I'M- NEW TO

01:23:49.290 --> 01:23:50.692
SINCE I'VE BEEN AT THE SENATE I

01:23:50.759 --> 01:23:51.426
WASN'T ON IN THIS FAMILIES

01:23:51.493 --> 01:23:53.027
THAT. I REALLY REALIZE THERE'S

01:23:53.094 --> 01:23:53.962
A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE TO

01:23:54.028 --> 01:23:55.096
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OTHER PEOPLE

01:23:55.163 --> 01:23:56.631
WHETHER IT'S CREDIT CARDS ARE

01:23:56.698 --> 01:23:57.932
WHAT I'VE LEARNED AND I'VE AND

01:23:57.999 --> 01:23:59.801
I'VE BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF HOSE-

01:23:59.868 --> 01:24:02.404
BILLS TO GO THROUGH HERE THAT.

01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:03.738
PROTECT PEOPLE FROM. IS THAT

01:24:03.805 --> 01:24:04.939
NOT THEIR OWN KNOWLEDGE NOT

01:24:05.006 --> 01:24:06.207
KNOWING THAT THEY'RE GETTING

01:24:06.274 --> 01:24:08.209
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF SO. THE PACE

01:24:08.276 --> 01:24:09.411
PROGRAM'S BEEN AROUND A LONG

01:24:09.477 --> 01:24:11.613
TIME AND IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE IT

01:24:11.679 --> 01:24:13.948
DOES DO WHAT WE WANT IN SOME

01:24:14.015 --> 01:24:14.416
CASES IF WE HAVE GOOD

01:24:14.482 --> 01:24:16.384
CONTRACTORS. THE DOES WHAT

01:24:16.451 --> 01:24:17.719
PEOPLE WANT TO GET DONE SO I

01:24:17.786 --> 01:24:18.553
DON'T WANT TO LIMIT THE PROGRAM

01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:20.255
BUT I ALSO WANNA MAKE SURE WE

01:24:20.321 --> 01:24:22.090
STRIKE A BALANCE AND I THINK

01:24:22.157 --> 01:24:23.491
AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR.

01:24:23.558 --> 01:24:24.726
GETTING ALL OF THE TEN MINUTES

01:24:24.793 --> 01:24:25.560
BEFORE THE MEETING WE'VE BEEN

01:24:25.627 --> 01:24:26.828
TRYING TO I'VE BEEN REACHED OUT

01:24:26.895 --> 01:24:27.595
OVER THEWEEKEND AND I

01:24:27.662 --> 01:24:29.164
APPRECIATE THAT. BECAUSE THIS

01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:30.665
IS A THIS IS A TIGHT ROPE I

01:24:30.732 --> 01:24:31.533
THINK THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:24:31.599 --> 01:24:32.333
WALK HERE TO DO THE RIGHT

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:34.335
THING. SO TWO QUESTIONS THAT

01:24:34.402 --> 01:24:37.172
NEED TO BE ANSWERED FOR ME IS.

01:24:37.238 --> 01:24:39.040
THE AVAILABILITY OF. PEOPLE DO

01:24:39.107 --> 01:24:40.241
DO THE INSPECTION NUMBER ONE I

01:24:40.308 --> 01:24:41.810
THINK IS. ANOTHER VISIT THERE'S

01:24:41.876 --> 01:24:42.811
NUMBERS ALL OVER THE PLACE

01:24:42.877 --> 01:24:45.346
FIFTY. S. I DON'T KNOW IF

01:24:45.413 --> 01:24:47.115
THAT'S TRUE OR NOT- BUT IT

01:24:47.182 --> 01:24:48.516
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED FOR

01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:50.752
PEOPLE THAT. LIVE IN A VERY.

01:24:50.819 --> 01:24:52.086
GEOGRAPHIC AREA WHERE TRAVEL

01:24:52.153 --> 01:24:54.255
TIMES ARE HUGE IN IT WILL DRIVE

01:24:54.322 --> 01:24:56.157
THAT COST UP NUMBER ONE. AND

01:24:56.224 --> 01:24:57.959
THEN NUMBER TWO THE COST OF THE

01:24:58.026 --> 01:25:00.161
AUDIT AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE-

01:25:00.228 --> 01:25:01.996
SO THOSE ARE TWO THINGS I THINK

01:25:02.063 --> 01:25:03.898
WILL BE CRITICAL FOR MY JUST.

01:25:03.965 --> 01:25:04.899
FOR MY DISH AND I WANT TO TELL

01:25:04.966 --> 01:25:05.600
YOU I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT

01:25:05.667 --> 01:25:07.769
YOUR BILL TODAY AND THE REASON

01:25:07.836 --> 01:25:08.369
I'M GONNA TELL YOU THE REASON

01:25:08.436 --> 01:25:10.338
WHY. NOT THAT I DON'T THINK

01:25:10.405 --> 01:25:11.339
YOU'LL GET THERE AND I MAY BE

01:25:11.406 --> 01:25:12.774
ABLE TO SUPPORT IT IS THE FACT

01:25:12.841 --> 01:25:14.075
THAT. IF YOU LAY OFF OF THE

01:25:14.142 --> 01:25:15.643
BILL IT HAS NO OPPOSITION AND

01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:16.778
THEN THERE'S NO INCENTIVE TO

01:25:16.845 --> 01:25:18.546
WORK. AS A REPUBLICAN I DON'T

01:25:18.613 --> 01:25:19.347
WANT TO SUPPORT TO BUILD AND

01:25:19.414 --> 01:25:21.416
HAVE TO COME BACK IN LATER NOT

01:25:21.483 --> 01:25:22.016
GET WHAT I WANT I WANT YOU TO

01:25:22.083 --> 01:25:23.718
GET WHERE YOU'RE GOING. SO I

01:25:23.785 --> 01:25:24.886
WILL BE THE OPPOSITION TODAY

01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:25.954
THIS SAYS HEY WE NEED TO WORK

01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:27.822
ON THIS. BECAUSE I DO WANT TO

01:25:27.889 --> 01:25:29.023
SUPPORT THE BILL EVENTUALLY.

01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:30.024
BUT I THINK THERE'S SOME

01:25:30.091 --> 01:25:31.259
CRITICAL. THINGS THOSE TWO

01:25:31.326 --> 01:25:33.795
THINGS. FOR SURE- I THINK NEED

01:25:33.862 --> 01:25:35.063
TO BE ADDRESSED AND EVEN

01:25:35.129 --> 01:25:36.798
OPPOSITION BROUGHT IT UP AND-

01:25:36.865 --> 01:25:39.067

IN. L. A. SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:43.505
DIEGO IS A WAY DIFFERENT WORLD

01:25:43.571 --> 01:25:44.239
OUT THERE TO GETTING

WHERE THEY'RE- COST EFFECTIVE

01:25:51.379 --> 01:25:52.413
SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY THEN

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:53.815

THIS PART. PROGRAM BECAUSE IT

01:27:18.366 --> 01:27:20.168
IS STATE SPONSORED BECAUSE IT

01:27:20.234 --> 01:27:22.103

BECAUSE IT'S THIS PRO PROGRAM.

01:30:01.929 --> 01:30:03.297
ABOUT ONE OF THE CHALLENGESIN

01:30:03.364 --> 01:30:05.533
THE PROGRAM IS THAT. IT IT IS

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.568
TERRIFIC IT CREATES AN

01:30:07.635 --> 01:30:08.169
OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO BE

01:30:08.236 --> 01:30:12.006
ABLE TO- GET SOME REAL- REALLY

01:30:12.073 --> 01:30:14.041
IMPORTANT. SOLAR PROJECTS

01:30:14.108 --> 01:30:16.177
TAKING CARE OF ON ON AND FOR

01:30:16.244 --> 01:30:17.945
SOME OF THE AREAS THAT HAVE A

01:30:18.012 --> 01:30:20.148
HIGH ENERGY USES BECAUSE IT'S

01:30:20.214 --> 01:30:20.715
REALLY HOT IN THE SUMMER AND

01:30:20.782 --> 01:30:22.483
REALLY COLD IN THE WINTER. THIS

01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:25.453
IS A GODSEND BUT- BUT- IT IS

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:27.622
PART OF THE PROGRAM WE DIDN'T

01:30:27.688 --> 01:30:30.191
SET UP. THE CONSUMER PROTECTION

01:30:30.258 --> 01:30:31.692
REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE IT WAS

01:30:31.759 --> 01:30:32.927
SUCH A GREAT PROGRAM AND

01:30:32.994 --> 01:30:35.329
BECAUSE IT WAS DONE. FOR GOOD

01:30:35.396 --> 01:30:36.564
ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS WE JUST

01:30:36.631 --> 01:30:38.566
DIDN'T SET UP ANY CONSUMER

01:30:38.633 --> 01:30:39.901
PROTECTION WE DIDN'T SET UP

01:30:39.967 --> 01:30:41.435
ENOUGH CONSUMER PROTECTION.

01:30:41.502 --> 01:30:44.539
OPPORTUNITIES SO THAT- PEOPLE

01:30:44.605 --> 01:30:46.274
OF LIMITED MEANS COULD BE

01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:48.109
PROTECTED AND BECAUSE THIS

01:30:48.176 --> 01:30:51.979
PROGRAM ASSUMES- A PRINCIPAL.

01:30:52.046 --> 01:30:54.348
PLACE OVER THE MORTGAGE OVER

01:30:54.415 --> 01:30:57.385
THAT. THE THE MORTGAGE AND THE

01:30:57.451 --> 01:31:00.688
TAXES- IT CREATES A SITUATION

01:31:00.755 --> 01:31:02.924
WHERE- PEOPLE WHO DON'T

01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:04.926
UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS AND

01:31:04.992 --> 01:31:06.060
DON'T UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT IT

01:31:06.127 --> 01:31:09.664
HAS. ON CAN BE- TAKEN ADVANTAGE

01:31:09.730 --> 01:31:11.232
OF AND THAT'S REALLY

01:31:11.299 --> 01:31:13.067
UNFORTUNATE I THINK THIS THIS

01:31:13.134 --> 01:31:16.137
BILL- CAN HELP TO FLIP THAT

01:31:16.204 --> 01:31:19.740
BUT- I ALSO- UNDERSTAND THAT IT

01:31:19.807 --> 01:31:21.943
DID THE AUDIT. DISCUSSION NEEDS

01:31:22.009 --> 01:31:24.545
TO BE NARROWED- I'VE TALKED TO

01:31:24.612 --> 01:31:26.414
THE CENTER SENATOR ABOUT THAT.

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:28.449
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. DOING

01:31:28.516 --> 01:31:29.283
A FULL AUDIT WHERE YOU'RE

01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:30.484
TRYING TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOU

01:31:30.551 --> 01:31:32.253
NEED DOUBLE PANED WINDOWS AND

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:33.955
INSTALL NEW INSULATION AND

01:31:34.021 --> 01:31:35.389
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. THAT

01:31:35.456 --> 01:31:37.592
WERE REALLY TALKING ABOUT. WHAT

01:31:37.658 --> 01:31:39.193
THE PACE PROGRAM CAN PROVIDE

01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:41.128
AND I THINK. THERE ARE A NUMBER

01:31:41.195 --> 01:31:43.064
OF FUNDS IN DIFFERENT AGENCIES

01:31:43.130 --> 01:31:45.066
THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO BE

01:31:45.132 --> 01:31:47.468
ABLE TO PAY FOR THIS UP FRONT.

01:31:47.535 --> 01:31:49.237
SO THAT WE CAN GET REALLY GOOD

01:31:49.303 --> 01:31:50.972
VALUE FOR THE PROPERTY OWNER

01:31:51.038 --> 01:31:51.873

01:31:51.939 --> 01:31:52.840
PACE PROGRAM SOME OF THE

01:31:52.907 --> 01:31:55.409

NOT MAYBE NOT FIT PERFECT BUT

01:33:36.978 --> 01:33:40.081
IT COULD BE A MODEL- THEY'VE

01:33:40.147 --> 01:33:43.184

01:37:29.777 --> 01:37:31.445
THAT WOULD BE SO BENEFICIAL FOR

01:37:31.512 --> 01:37:33.781
THEM AS AS HOMEOWNERS- YOUR

01:37:33.847 --> 01:37:35.182

01:37:44.325 --> 01:37:46.360
BURDEN BUT A CONDUIT OF BOTH

01:37:46.427 --> 01:37:49.396
PROTECTION IN IT- VISIBILITY.

01:37:49.463 --> 01:37:50.431
I'M SORRY IT WAS A LITTLE HARD

01:37:50.497 --> 01:37:52.099
TO HEAR YOU BUT AS THE QUESTION

01:37:52.166 --> 01:37:54.802
I AS I UNDERSTAND IT- WHAT IS

01:37:54.868 --> 01:37:56.537
THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT AND THE

01:37:56.604 --> 01:37:58.405
REQUIREMENTS TO BE AN AUDITOR

01:37:58.472 --> 01:37:59.373
UNDER THIS PROGRAM. PARTICULAR

01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:02.142
REQUIREMENT. YES AND ALSO A

01:38:02.209 --> 01:38:04.712
WITH REGARDS TO THE COST AND IF

01:38:04.778 --> 01:38:07.281
WE ADD YOUR THOUGHTS ON IT- THE

01:38:07.348 --> 01:38:09.450
STILL AT FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:38:09.516 --> 01:38:10.951
TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS IT. IT'S

01:38:11.018 --> 01:38:13.153
LITTLE STEVE. YOUR THOUGHTS ON

01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:15.956
HOW WE COULD EXPAND THE POOL OF

01:38:16.023 --> 01:38:17.625
INSPECTORS IN ORDER TO CONDUCT

01:38:17.691 --> 01:38:19.893
THE AUDITS AND THAT HOW THAT

01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:21.195
WOULD ALLOW US TO REDUCE THE

01:38:21.262 --> 01:38:22.096
COST TO SERVE IT'S MORE

01:38:22.162 --> 01:38:23.864
FEASIBLE. FOR HOMEOWNERS

01:38:23.931 --> 01:38:27.901
BECAUSE THE LAST. THING WE WANT

01:38:27.968 --> 01:38:29.303
TO DO IS- THE FIRST BFI. BURDEN

01:38:29.370 --> 01:38:31.305
ON ON THE HOMEOWNERS RIGHT IN

01:38:31.372 --> 01:38:33.707
NUMBER TWO AT. THE TRYING TO

01:38:33.774 --> 01:38:36.210
REDUCE THE- THE ABILITY FOR

01:38:36.277 --> 01:38:38.078
THEM TO PURSUE HAVING THESE

01:38:38.145 --> 01:38:39.580
THESE HOME IMPROVEMENTS WE

01:38:39.647 --> 01:38:40.881
DON'T WANT TO DISSUADE THEM WE

01:38:40.948 --> 01:38:41.548
WANT TO ENCOURAGE AND

01:38:41.615 --> 01:38:43.784
INCENTIVISE YEAH. SO AND YOUR

01:38:43.851 --> 01:38:46.654
THOUGHTS ON EXPANDING THE POOL-

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:48.856
SO THAT MORE. SAY HOME

01:38:48.922 --> 01:38:49.990

FAQ. COMPANY WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS

01:38:53.627 --> 01:38:56.130
ON THAT. YEAH- SO FEW QUESTIONS

01:38:56.196 --> 01:38:56.930
AND THEN I'LL TRY TO ADDRESS

01:38:56.997 --> 01:38:58.899
EACH IN TURN AND SENATORS MAN

01:38:58.966 --> 01:38:59.933
SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU AND I'M

TIME IF WE COULD- CLOSE RECIPES

01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:04.772
AND ALSO PERHAPS CLOSE AT THE

01:39:04.838 --> 01:39:05.839
SAME TIME SEEN NO OTHER

01:39:05.906 --> 01:39:07.107
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. PERFECT

01:39:07.174 --> 01:39:08.942

APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR QUESTIONS.

01:39:10.811 --> 01:39:11.979
I GUESS THE FIRST THING I

01:39:12.046 --> 01:39:13.914
EMPHASIZE IS THAT THIS PACE

01:39:13.981 --> 01:39:15.215
PROGRAM IS NOT THE ONLY SOURCE

01:39:15.282 --> 01:39:16.083
OF FINANCING OBVIOUSLY

01:39:16.150 --> 01:39:18.018
AVAILABLE FOR HOME IMPROVEMENTS

01:39:18.085 --> 01:39:19.720
OR OR HOME IMPROVEMENTS. THAT

01:39:19.787 --> 01:39:20.554
ARE MEANT TO IMPROVE ENERGY

01:39:20.621 --> 01:39:23.290
EFFICIENCY- AND ALSO POINT OUT

01:39:23.357 --> 01:39:24.858
AGAIN THAT BECAUSE THIS PROGRAM

01:39:24.925 --> 01:39:27.728
IS SENATOR CABALLERO DESCRIBED-

01:39:27.795 --> 01:39:30.331
PUTS A SUPER SENIOR LEAN. ON

01:39:30.397 --> 01:39:31.432
THE CROSSES PROGRAM IT IS

01:39:31.498 --> 01:39:34.201
UNIQUE. AND CAN CREATE ENORMOUS

01:39:34.268 --> 01:39:36.136
COSTS FOR HOMEOWNERS IF IT IF

01:39:36.203 --> 01:39:37.438
THEY GET UP SOLD IF THEY GET

01:39:37.504 --> 01:39:38.772
SOLD SOME KIND OF IMPROVEMENT

01:39:38.839 --> 01:39:40.341
THAT DOESN'T HELP THEM- AND

01:39:40.407 --> 01:39:41.475
THAT'S THE FRONT OR TRYING TO

01:39:41.542 --> 01:39:43.477
ADDRESS- WE WANT A MODEST COST

01:39:43.544 --> 01:39:45.245
UP FRONT. I DON'T HAVE A NUMBER

01:39:45.312 --> 01:39:46.847
IN MIND I'LL SAY THAT. WE

01:39:46.914 --> 01:39:48.449
BELIEVE THE OPPOSITION'S

01:39:48.515 --> 01:39:49.783
NUMBERS ON ENERGY AUDITS ARE

01:39:49.850 --> 01:39:52.219
GROSSLY INFLATED- WE HAVE FOUND

01:39:52.286 --> 01:39:53.287
IN OUR RESEARCH THAT THE

01:39:53.354 --> 01:39:54.488
AVERAGE COST IS SOMEWHERE

01:39:54.555 --> 01:39:56.056
BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED TO SEVEN

01:39:56.123 --> 01:39:57.157
HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR ON IT. WE

01:39:57.224 --> 01:39:58.192
WOULD LIKE TO GET IT DOWN FROM

01:39:58.258 --> 01:39:59.793
THERE. IS A LOWER INTO THAT IN

01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:02.296
DOWN FROM THERE IDEALLY- YOU

01:40:02.363 --> 01:40:03.464
