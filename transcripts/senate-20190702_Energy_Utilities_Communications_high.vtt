ENERGY COMMISSION TO CONSIDER

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:31.717
MORE THAN DOUBLING THE SOLAR

00:07:37.256 --> 00:07:38.925
TWENTY THIRTY IF THAT IS COST

00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:40.092
EFFECTIVE.

DESIGNED REFLECT SUNLIGHT ABSORB

00:07:44.463 --> 00:07:45.932
LESS HEAT.

00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:48.835
AND AND IN FACT DECREASE -- THE

00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:50.536
IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND

00:07:50.603 --> 00:07:52.071
AND THAT THE CREATION HEAT

WRIST LAST ABOUT TWENTY YEARS

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:58.377
AND SO WE COULD BE ON A CYCLE

00:07:58.444 --> 00:07:59.879
FOR REDUCING HEAT ISLANDS AND

00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:01.681

ENERGY EFFICIENCY SAVINGS BY.

00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:50.316
TWENTY THREE THANKS.

00:10:50.383 --> 00:10:52.518
GENERALLY I MEAN WORLD.

00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:54.487
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CORPS OF

00:10:54.553 --> 00:10:55.755
TECHNOLOGY OTHER THAN PAINTING

00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:56.822
THE ROOF WHITE OR HAVING A LIGHT

00:10:56.889 --> 00:10:57.923
COLOR ROOF?

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.991
AND HAVING THE VENTING WHAT ELSE

00:10:59.058 --> 00:11:01.093
ARE YOU.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.094
IN THIS CASE IS PRIMARILY WE

00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:04.330
CALL COOL COLOR TECHNOLOGY HALF

00:11:04.397 --> 00:11:06.332
OF SUNLIGHT IS INVISIBLE SO FOR

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:08.267
DECADES.

00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:09.769
ROUTING PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN SOLD

00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:11.303
THAT ARE MORE REFLECTIVE THAN

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:12.271
YOUR I WOULD.

00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:13.906
PERCEIVE BECAUSE THEY DO A GOOD

00:11:13.973 --> 00:11:15.975
JOB OF REFLECTING THE INVISIBLE

00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:17.109
HALF OF SUNLIGHT.

00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:19.045
IN FACT AN ORDINARY RED CLAY

00:11:19.111 --> 00:11:21.547
TILE ROOF JUST AS AN EXAMPLE IS

00:11:21.614 --> 00:11:23.215
ONE OF THOSE IT REFLECTS ONLY

00:11:23.282 --> 00:11:25.184
ABOUT 20% OF VISIBLE LIGHT.

00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:27.753
BUT ABOUT A 40% OF SUNLIGHT

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.121
BECAUSE IT'S REFLECTING A LOT OF

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:30.656
THE INVISIBLE SOME LIGHT THAT

00:11:30.723 --> 00:11:32.925
STRIKES THE ROOF.

00:11:32.992 --> 00:11:33.526
AND THAT'S TRUE OF MANY OTHER

00:11:33.592 --> 00:11:35.094
COLORS.

00:11:35.161 --> 00:11:37.329
TO SO IT'S READ A IF YOU HAVE A

00:11:37.396 --> 00:11:37.930
BLACK ROOF I IMAGINE THAT'S

00:11:37.997 --> 00:11:40.232
PROBABLY THE WORST.

00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:47.640
AN ORDINARY BLACK ROOF.

00:11:47.706 --> 00:11:49.408
OKAY ACTUALLY ON THE GOOD SIDE

00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:51.710
WE GO HERE'S YEAH WE WE HAVE

00:11:51.777 --> 00:11:53.245
SHOWN.

00:11:53.312 --> 00:11:54.113
WE WE ACTUALLY CAN THEN BRING

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.315
OUT THE SAMPLES HERE BUT YOU CAN

00:11:56.382 --> 00:11:59.251
MAKE A BLACK ROOF THAT REFLECTS

00:11:59.318 --> 00:12:00.519
40% OF SUNLIGHT AND THE REASON

00:12:00.586 --> 00:12:01.020
IS.

00:12:01.087 --> 00:12:02.288
THE COLOR DOESN'T AFFECT ITS

00:12:02.354 --> 00:12:03.989
ABILITY TO REFLECT THE INVISIBLE

00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:05.491
SUNLIGHT AND OVER HALF OF THE

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:06.959
SUNLIGHT IS INVISIBLE THEY'RE

00:12:07.026 --> 00:12:08.961
ACTUALLY PRODUCTS OUT THERE THAT

00:12:09.028 --> 00:12:11.530
ARE BLACK AND WOULD MEET THIS

00:12:11.597 --> 00:12:11.864
REQUIREMENT.

00:12:11.931 --> 00:12:13.532
NOW OF COURSE NOT PROMOTING THE

00:12:13.599 --> 00:12:15.134
USE OF BLACK ROOTS BUT HELL HELL

00:12:15.201 --> 00:12:17.970
COLORS ARE AVAILABLE I'M ASKING

00:12:18.037 --> 00:12:23.309
BECAUSE SO HOW CAN I MAKE MY

00:12:23.375 --> 00:12:24.610
LIKE ROOF MORE REFLECTIVE.

00:12:24.677 --> 00:12:27.046
THE BEST MOVE IS WHEN YOU ARE

00:12:27.113 --> 00:12:28.714
IT'S TIME TO REPLACE THE ROOF

00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:30.049
THAT'S WHEN YOU WANT TO CHOOSE A

00:12:30.116 --> 00:12:31.317
COOL ROOFING PRODUCT BECAUSE

00:12:31.383 --> 00:12:32.785
THAT WAY THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL

00:12:32.852 --> 00:12:34.820
LABOR OR MATERIAL EXPENSE. FOR

00:12:34.887 --> 00:12:36.589
MOST PRODUCTS THE COLOR IN THE

00:12:36.655 --> 00:12:38.657
REFLECTANCE OF THE ROOFING

00:12:38.724 --> 00:12:40.159
MATERIAL DON'T AFFECT THE PRICE

00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:42.194
AND MOST ROOFS ARE PLACED ON

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:43.696
HOMES ABOUT EVERY TWENTY YEARS

00:12:43.762 --> 00:12:45.264
THAT MEANS 5% OF THE ROOFING

00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:47.366
STOCK IS TURNING OVER EACH YEAR.

00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:48.033
JUST BECAUSE IT'S REACHED END OF

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.569
SERVICE LIFE AND THERE'S YOUR

00:12:50.636 --> 00:12:51.470
OPPORTUNITY.

00:12:51.537 --> 00:12:53.372
THANK YOU -- BE IN TWENTY YEARS

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:55.808
I GUESS BUT BUT ANYWAY THANK YOU

00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:57.209
FOR THE FREE CONSULTATION --

00:12:57.276 --> 00:12:59.778
ANYONE IN THE PUBLIC WE ALREADY

00:12:59.845 --> 00:13:01.280
WENT THROUGH THIS MEMBERS.

00:13:01.347 --> 00:13:03.482
WHAT WHAT IS THE COST OF THIS

00:13:03.549 --> 00:13:06.285
OVER -- A CURRENT.

00:13:06.352 --> 00:13:08.654
THE OUT NON REFLECTIVE ROUGH

00:13:08.721 --> 00:13:10.322
SURE -- SO IS STUDY WAS SENT AS

00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:13.192
A MENTION IN -- TWO THOUSAND

00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:13.826
SIXTEEN FOR THE STATE AND WANTED

00:13:13.893 --> 00:13:16.529
FOUND IS THAT. FOR MATERIALS

00:13:16.595 --> 00:13:17.696
OTHER THAN ASPHALT SHINGLES FOR

00:13:17.763 --> 00:13:19.665
EXAMPLE CLAY TILE CONCRETE TILE

00:13:19.732 --> 00:13:22.601
METAL THERE IS NO COST PREMIUM.

00:13:22.668 --> 00:13:23.936
SO THE COLOR IN THE REFLECTANCE

00:13:24.003 --> 00:13:25.804
FOR THOSE TYPES OF BIRDS HAD NO

00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:27.606
EFFECT ON THE PRICE.

00:13:27.673 --> 00:13:30.142
AND FOR A ASPHALT SHINGLES WHICH

00:13:30.209 --> 00:13:31.744
ARE QUITE COMMON THEY FOUND A

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:33.913
STRONG OVERLAP BETWEEN THE

00:13:33.979 --> 00:13:35.648
PRICES OF THE ROOFS THAT ARE

00:13:35.714 --> 00:13:37.550
REQUIRED BY TODAY'S BUILDING

00:13:37.616 --> 00:13:39.285
CODES LOWER PERFORMANCE SCHOOL

00:13:39.351 --> 00:13:39.518
ROOFS.

00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:42.254
AND HIGHER PERFORMANCE COOL

00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:42.788
RIFFS OF THE TYPE THAT I'M

00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:43.355
SPEAKING.

00:13:43.422 --> 00:13:44.557
SO IN MANY CASES THERE IS NO

00:13:44.623 --> 00:13:45.991
DIFFERENCE IN PRICE IN SOME

00:13:46.058 --> 00:13:46.592
CASES THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:47.960
PRICE.

00:13:48.027 --> 00:13:49.895
I WOULD ALSO MENTION THOUGH THAT

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:51.597
THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL ENERGY

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:53.966
COST SAVINGS PROVIDED BY GOING

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:55.868
TO THE COOL ROOF -- OVER THE

00:13:55.935 --> 00:13:57.203
LIFETIME OF THE ROOF THE SAVINGS

00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:59.138
OF A PRESENT VALUE OF ABOUT

00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:00.639
FIFTY CENTS TO A DOLLAR PER

00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:01.540
SQUARE FOOT.

00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:03.142
SO EVEN IF YOU HAD A COST

00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:05.477
PREMIUM OF THAT NATURE IT WOULD

00:14:05.544 --> 00:14:06.712
BE PAID BACK BY THE ENERGY

00:14:06.779 --> 00:14:08.414
SAVINGS.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.648
AND I THINK AN IMPORTANT POINT

00:14:09.715 --> 00:14:10.115
TO MAKE IS THAT COST

00:14:10.182 --> 00:14:11.217
EFFECTIVENESS ISN'T A COMPONENT

00:14:11.283 --> 00:14:13.519
OF THE BILL.

00:14:13.586 --> 00:14:15.854
WE HAVE OPPOSITION LIKE TO SPEAK

00:14:15.921 --> 00:14:16.622

EFFECTIVENESS IS ALREADY IN THE

00:26:43.935 --> 00:26:45.503
BILL.

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:46.771
SO IT CANNOT INCREASE COSTS WELL

00:26:46.838 --> 00:26:48.373
IN A SIMILAR TO BE CLEAR IT'S

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.542
ALSO SHALL CONSIDER RIGHT -- SO

00:26:50.608 --> 00:26:52.243
IT'S ALL IT'S NOT A MANDATE IT'S

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:53.345

MANDATE AND IT'S A SHOCK

00:26:54.846 --> 00:26:57.082
CONSIDER AND IT THAT THE CHANGE

00:26:57.148 --> 00:26:57.816
HAS TO BE THAT.

00:26:57.882 --> 00:26:59.684
OF COST EFFECTIVENESS OVER THE

00:26:59.751 --> 00:27:00.618
LIFE THE ROOF HAS TO BE

00:27:00.685 --> 00:27:01.853
CONSIDERED AS WELL.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.556
IN THE SHOP.

AND EIGHT BUT IT'S REALLY THE

00:27:08.393 --> 00:27:09.661
CONSIDERATIONS RIGHT SO THE BUT

00:27:09.728 --> 00:27:10.562
I SEE YEARS THAT THERE'S

00:27:10.628 --> 00:27:12.530
DISCRETION TO SAY NO FRUSTRATED

00:27:12.597 --> 00:27:14.199
CC YEP SO AND WE'VE ALREADY

00:27:14.265 --> 00:27:16.001
HEARD TESTIMONY THE COLORS AS

00:27:16.067 --> 00:27:20.171
DIVERSE AS RED AND BLACK --

00:27:20.238 --> 00:27:22.107
COULD MEET THE STANDARD.

00:27:22.173 --> 00:27:23.775
OKAY THANKS CAN I SPEAK TO THE

00:27:23.842 --> 00:27:27.078
TO THE FIRE NO NO SIR.

00:27:27.145 --> 00:27:28.113
I'M SORRY JUST FOLLOW THIS.

00:27:28.179 --> 00:27:29.981
DID ANYBODY ELSE WANT TO SPEAK

00:27:30.048 --> 00:27:30.482
YEAH.

00:27:30.548 --> 00:27:37.355
WE HAD ALL THIS. TO THE RIGHT

00:27:37.422 --> 00:27:38.456
KNOW I THINK THE THE IDEA IS

00:27:38.523 --> 00:27:39.557
GREAT AND AS WE TALKED EARLIER

00:27:39.624 --> 00:27:40.158
TODAY I DON'T KNOW WITH THE

00:27:40.225 --> 00:27:41.159
AMENDMENTS SOMEHOW I WILL

00:27:41.226 --> 00:27:42.193
SUPPORT THE BILL I DO HAVE

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:42.927
CONCERNS ESPECIALLY IN.

00:27:42.994 --> 00:27:44.729
THE AREA THAT I COME FROM IN THE

00:27:44.796 --> 00:27:48.433
CLIMATE THAT WE LIVE IN -- DOES

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.434
YOU KNOW I THINK THIS WOULD BE

00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:51.436
CHALLENGING AND CERTAINLY COLORS

00:27:51.503 --> 00:27:53.171
OF A CONSIDERATION FOR ROOF XIN.

00:27:53.238 --> 00:27:54.372
AND I THINK THAT THE SCIENCE MAY

00:27:54.439 --> 00:27:57.308
NOT BE THERE TO TO DO THAT BUT

00:27:57.375 --> 00:27:58.510
YOU KNOW I'LL BE HAPPY TO MOVE

00:27:58.576 --> 00:28:00.545
THE BILL BUT IS CERTAINLY WILL.

00:28:00.612 --> 00:28:02.580
LOOK AT IT IT APPROPRIATIONS AND

00:28:02.647 --> 00:28:04.849
AND AS IT COMES TO THE FLOOR TO

00:28:04.916 --> 00:28:05.450
SEE IF.

00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:08.486
IT GIVES MORE THOUGHT TO THANK

00:28:08.553 --> 00:28:08.653
YOU.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.655
THANK YOU.

00:28:10.722 --> 00:28:12.390
I'M JUST CURIOUS -- SINCE CC ARI

00:28:12.457 --> 00:28:13.625
ODDS THE THIRTY TO DO THIS AND

00:28:13.691 --> 00:28:15.326
HASN'T.

00:28:15.393 --> 00:28:17.295
AND THEY FEEL IT'S NOT COST

00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:18.696
EFFECTIVE.

00:28:18.763 --> 00:28:20.832
WHAT TO WHAT CHANGES HERE?

00:28:20.899 --> 00:28:27.806
YEAH SURE -- THANKS SO THE AT

00:28:27.872 --> 00:28:28.640
LUNCH ONE LOOK AT IT.

00:28:28.706 --> 00:28:30.041
SO THE ANSWER IS THAT THE CDC

00:28:30.108 --> 00:28:31.743
HAD BEEN OPERATING ON THE

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:33.311
ASSUMPTIONS OF WORK THAT WE

00:28:33.378 --> 00:28:35.213
ACTUALLY DID LBNL AND THE BASE

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.215
THE CODE ON WHAT THE BENEFITS

00:28:37.282 --> 00:28:39.084
WOULD BE FOR NEW HOMES.

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:40.885
WE DID RECENT ANALYSIS FOR

00:28:40.952 --> 00:28:42.387
ANOTHER PROJECT FUNDED BY THE

00:28:42.454 --> 00:28:43.621
ENERGY COMMISSION AND THAT'S WE

00:28:43.688 --> 00:28:44.923
REALIZE THAT THE POTENTIAL FOR

00:28:44.989 --> 00:28:46.758
ENERGY SAVINGS WERE ABOUT TEN

00:28:46.825 --> 00:28:48.426
TIMES GREATER THAN HAD BEEN

00:28:48.493 --> 00:28:49.661
ASSUMED BEFORE.

00:28:49.727 --> 00:28:53.264
AND THAT CHANGES THE EQUATION.

00:28:53.331 --> 00:28:54.466
SO THAT'S THE NEWS [inaudible]

00:28:54.532 --> 00:28:55.533
OKAY.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.768
BUT THAT STILL DOESN'T SPEAK TO

00:28:56.835 --> 00:28:59.537
WHY THE CC HASN'T DONE THEIR JOB

00:28:59.604 --> 00:29:01.539
AND LOOKING AT THIS PART TO THE

00:29:01.606 --> 00:29:02.974
YOU MAY CONSIDER THIS NEW

00:29:03.041 --> 00:29:03.975
INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN

00:29:04.042 --> 00:29:06.611
DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST FEW

00:29:06.678 --> 00:29:07.879
YEARS AND IS NOW BEEN BROUGHT TO

00:29:07.946 --> 00:29:08.980
BE SO THEY WILL BE ENTERTAINING

00:29:09.047 --> 00:29:09.514
MENTION.

00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:11.182
THE LABORATORY TO DO THE

00:29:11.249 --> 00:29:12.750
RESEARCH FOR THEM IN ORDER THE

00:29:12.817 --> 00:29:13.918
MOVE.

00:29:13.985 --> 00:29:15.420
FOR YOU COULD SAY THAT I CAN'T

00:29:15.487 --> 00:29:17.922
SPEAK FOR THEM -- BUT I WILL SAY

00:29:17.989 --> 00:29:19.657
THAT THE ENERGY COMMISSION DOES

00:29:19.724 --> 00:29:21.459
OFTEN RELY ON RESEARCH AND IN

00:29:21.526 --> 00:29:23.027
THIS CASE WAS RESEARCH THAT IT

00:29:23.094 --> 00:29:25.163
HAD FUNDED FOR ANOTHER PROJECT.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:25.730
IN THIS BROUGHT TO LIGHT THE

00:29:25.797 --> 00:29:30.735
OPPORTUNITY -- SENATOR RUBIO

00:29:30.802 --> 00:29:32.303
CLOVER CENTER DR.

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:34.973
THANK YOU -- I REALLY HAVE GIVEN

00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:36.508
IT MUCH THOUGHT TO THIS BILL IN

00:29:36.574 --> 00:29:38.810
PARTICULAR BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT

00:29:38.877 --> 00:29:40.478
OUR GOALS ARE AS CALIFORNIANS.

00:29:40.545 --> 00:29:42.447
BUT I HAVE A LOT OF CONFLICTS AS

00:29:42.514 --> 00:29:43.548
IT PERTAINS TO YOU KOW

00:29:43.615 --> 00:29:45.517
PORTANTINO IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF

00:29:45.583 --> 00:29:46.151
CALIFORNIA.

00:29:46.217 --> 00:29:47.719
AND I'VE BEEN HEARING SOME OF

00:29:47.785 --> 00:29:49.587
THE AYE SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS

00:29:49.654 --> 00:29:51.823
AND I THINK ULTIMATELY FOR ME

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:52.624
THE BIGGEST CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:53.558
THAT.

00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:54.759
OUR HOUSING CRISIS WHICH IS

00:29:54.826 --> 00:29:57.662
REALLY A BIG ISSUE AND DIE

00:29:57.729 --> 00:29:59.130
GETTING PEOPLE.

00:29:59.197 --> 00:30:00.165
TO NOT ONLY GET HIM OFF THE

00:30:00.231 --> 00:30:02.066
STREETS ARE HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM

00:30:02.133 --> 00:30:04.068
BUT YOU KNOW THE AFFORDABILITY

00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:06.171
ISSUE AND I THINK THAT WE CAN

00:30:06.237 --> 00:30:08.173
TEACH TO ADD.

00:30:08.239 --> 00:30:09.607
A MORE REGULATIONS.

00:30:09.674 --> 00:30:11.376
MORE REQUIREMENTS AND I FEEL

00:30:11.442 --> 00:30:13.578
LIKE AT THIS POINT I'M NOT SURE

00:30:13.645 --> 00:30:14.646
I SEE.

00:30:14.712 --> 00:30:16.281
AND PERHAPS THAT'S MY DEFICIENCY

00:30:16.347 --> 00:30:17.715
AND I SHOULD HAVE YOU KNOW.

00:30:17.782 --> 00:30:18.683
I'VE BEEN RESEARCHING BUT I

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.485
DON'T SEE IT RIGHT NOW I DON'T

00:30:20.552 --> 00:30:22.654
SEE HOW THIS IS GONNA SOLVE THAT

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:26.157
PROBLEM IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW I

00:30:26.224 --> 00:30:27.725
DID HEAR I DID SPEAK TO SOME OF

00:30:27.792 --> 00:30:29.160
THE THE INDUSTRY FOLKS AND THEIR

00:30:29.227 --> 00:30:31.229
SHARE WITH ME -- JUST BE AN

00:30:31.296 --> 00:30:32.697
ABILITY TO HAVE CHOICE FOR FOR

00:30:32.764 --> 00:30:34.999
CONSUMERS BEING ABLE.

00:30:35.066 --> 00:30:35.733
TO DESIGN THEIR HOME IN A

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.335
PARTICULAR WAY IN OUR

00:30:37.402 --> 00:30:38.336
PRESCRIBING HOW THEY DO THEIR

00:30:38.403 --> 00:30:39.571
HOME AND AND SO I'M HAVING A LOT

00:30:39.637 --> 00:30:41.272
OF CONFLICTS LIKE I REALLY WANT

00:30:41.339 --> 00:30:43.074
TO SUPPORT IT BUT IN THIS MOMENT

00:30:43.141 --> 00:30:43.841
I JUST FEEL WE'RE ADDING ONE

00:30:43.908 --> 00:30:45.510
MORE LAYER. TWO PEOPLE THAT

00:30:45.577 --> 00:30:47.312
CAN'T AFFORD HOMES ONE MORE

00:30:47.378 --> 00:30:47.712
LAYER.

00:30:47.779 --> 00:30:50.415
TO OUR HOUSING CRISIS ONE MORE

00:30:50.481 --> 00:30:51.282
LAYER. TO TO A PROBLEM WE'RE

00:30:51.349 --> 00:30:53.518
TRYING TO SOLVE AND SO AT THIS

00:30:53.585 --> 00:30:55.019
POINT I I FEEL LIKE ANYWHERE

00:30:55.086 --> 00:30:56.588
MORE INFORMATION -- PERHAPS

00:30:56.654 --> 00:30:58.156
LATER I CAN JUMP ON BOARD IF I

00:30:58.223 --> 00:30:59.457
CAN.

00:30:59.524 --> 00:30:59.958
GET MORE RESEARCH MORE

00:31:00.024 --> 00:31:02.093
INFORMATION MORE CONCRETE DATA

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.162
AS TO HOW THIS HELPS BUT T THIS

00:31:04.229 --> 00:31:05.763
POINT I'M HAVING TROUBLE

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:06.264
SUPPORTING AND I WANTED

00:31:06.331 --> 00:31:07.365
EXPRESSED.

00:31:07.432 --> 00:31:08.633
YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR -- I

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:09.901
THINK A LOT OF YOUR CONCERNS CAN

00:31:09.968 --> 00:31:11.603
BE ADDRESSED ALREADY WE ARE

00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:12.570
RESTRICTED BY THE MATERIALS WE

00:31:12.637 --> 00:31:14.138
CAN USE FOR HOMES FOR EXAMPLE I

00:31:14.205 --> 00:31:15.306
LIVE IN A WILD IN URBAN

00:31:15.373 --> 00:31:17.075
INTERFACE I CANNOT PUT WHATEVER

00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:18.610
CITING I WANT ON MY HOME BECAUSE

00:31:18.676 --> 00:31:20.612
OF WHERE I LIVE -- WE DO THIS

00:31:20.678 --> 00:31:22.714
AND SO MANY OTHER PLACES IN HOME

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:24.716
CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS --

00:31:24.782 --> 00:31:25.350
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

00:31:25.416 --> 00:31:28.686
CALIFORNIA -- IN SO BUT I THINK

00:31:28.753 --> 00:31:30.855
PRIMARILY THE THE CONCERN I'VE

00:31:30.922 --> 00:31:32.223
HEARD NOT JUST FROM YOU BUT FROM

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:33.891
OTHERS IS THE COST.

00:31:33.958 --> 00:31:34.926
ONE HOW TO SOLVE OUR HOUSING

00:31:34.993 --> 00:31:38.229
PROBLEM AND SO THE COST LONG

00:31:38.296 --> 00:31:38.429
TERM.

00:31:38.496 --> 00:31:40.665
PROBABLY BE IT WILL BE LOWER

00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:42.100
BECAUSE OF THE THE HEATING AND

00:31:42.166 --> 00:31:45.670
COOLING SAVINGS FOR HOMEOWNERS.

00:31:45.737 --> 00:31:47.772
AND PEOPLE NEED TO REPLACE THE

00:31:47.839 --> 00:31:49.007
RIFFS ANYWAY.

00:31:49.073 --> 00:31:50.508
SO THIS IS CATCHING PEOPLE WHEN

00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:52.143
THEY REPLACE THE ROOF THAT WILL

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:57.315
GIVE THEM A LONGER TERM SAVINGS.

00:31:57.382 --> 00:31:58.883
AND AGAIN.

00:31:58.950 --> 00:31:59.651
IN THE BILL ITSELF COST

00:31:59.717 --> 00:32:00.652
EFFECTIVENESS MUST BE CONCERT

00:32:00.718 --> 00:32:01.486
THAT CONSIDERED.

00:32:01.552 --> 00:32:02.487
SO WE WILL NOT BE IN THE BILL

00:32:02.553 --> 00:32:03.121
DOESN'T MANDATE ANYTHING FIRST

00:32:03.187 --> 00:32:03.621
OF ALL.

00:32:03.688 --> 00:32:05.623
AND SECONDLY NOTHING WILL BE

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:07.925
MANDATED THAT IS MORE EXPENSIVE --

00:32:07.992 --> 00:32:11.929
THROUGH THE BILL AS WELL.

00:32:11.996 --> 00:32:13.431
AND I DOCTOR LEVINSON HAS SOME

00:32:13.498 --> 00:32:15.500
COMMENTS ON THIS POINT AS WELL

00:32:15.566 --> 00:32:17.635
SURE IT'S OKAY WILL WILL WILL.

00:32:17.702 --> 00:32:19.937
BUDGET ARE YOU ARE YOU.

00:32:20.004 --> 00:32:22.040

HOWEVER AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED THE

00:59:23.693 --> 00:59:24.894

00:59:24.961 --> 00:59:26.095
CONSEQUENCES LAID OUT WHAT MY

COLLEAGUE AT TECHNION.

00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:28.431
IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THE

00:59:28.498 --> 00:59:29.632
INTENT OF THIS BILL WITHOUT FOR

00:59:29.699 --> 00:59:31.067
IN THE PRIVACY OF USERS AND

00:59:31.134 --> 00:59:32.402
WITHOUT INCREASING OPERATIONAL

00:59:32.468 --> 00:59:34.604
DEMANDS ON THE PC AND INDUSTRY.

00:59:34.671 --> 00:59:35.571
IT'S CRITICAL TO FIRST IDENTIFY

00:59:35.638 --> 00:59:37.607
WHICH MUNICIPAL POLICIES THAT

00:59:37.674 --> 00:59:39.609
BENEFIT FROM TNC DATA AND FROM

00:59:39.676 --> 00:59:41.411

00:59:42.912 --> 00:59:43.846
MUNICIPALITY IS.

00:59:43.913 --> 00:59:45.581

00:59:45.648 --> 00:59:46.382
ENSURE THAT THE GOALS OF THE

ADEQUATE SAFEGUARDS.

00:59:52.255 --> 00:59:53.589
THE YEARS LONG RULE MAKING

00:59:53.656 --> 00:59:55.024
UNDERTAKEN BY THE PC REPRESENTS

00:59:55.091 --> 00:59:56.559
THE CHALLENGE OF DETERMINING

00:59:56.626 --> 00:59:57.927
THIS FOR SINGLE AGENCY.

00:59:57.994 --> 00:59:59.028
WITHOUT THE SAME FEAR OF CARE

00:59:59.095 --> 01:00:00.496
THE LEGISLATURE CAN RISK

01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:01.631
UNDERMINE THE PROCESS AND

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:03.499
EXPRESSING THE PC IN THE BELLY

01:00:03.566 --> 01:00:05.468
OPERATORS TO AN ENDLESS STREAM

01:00:05.535 --> 01:00:06.803
ON ACCORDING TO DATA REQUEST.

01:00:06.869 --> 01:00:08.371
THEY CAN POTENTIALLY RESULT IN A

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:09.572
SUBSTANTIAL VOLUME A SENSITIVE

01:00:09.639 --> 01:00:11.207
DATA BEING DISCLOSED BECAUSE THE

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:12.475
BILL DOES STILL CONTAIN THESE

01:00:12.542 --> 01:00:13.376
AMBIGUITIES AROUND THE

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:14.544
DEFINITIONS LAID OUT BY MY

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:15.812
COLLEAGUE AT TECH NET.

01:00:15.878 --> 01:00:16.946

GAPS IN THIS BILL FOR THESE

01:00:19.582 --> 01:00:24.487
REASONS AND OTHERS CAL TIMBER

01:00:24.554 --> 01:00:25.588
CONTINUES TO BE OPPOSED TO THIS

01:00:25.655 --> 01:00:26.589
BILL.

01:00:26.656 --> 01:00:29.325

CLUB CD CALIFORNIA ADVISERS HERE

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:31.527
WE HAVE UBER -- WE ALSO REMAIN

01:00:31.594 --> 01:00:32.161
OPPOSED THE REASONS STATED THANK

01:00:32.228 --> 01:00:32.362
YOU.

01:00:32.428 --> 01:00:33.496

01:00:33.563 --> 01:00:35.898
MEMBERS.

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:37.433
CENTER RUBIO THANK YOU.

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.102
WELL FIRST FIVE ONE I THINK THE

01:00:39.168 --> 01:00:40.536
AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD

01:00:40.603 --> 01:00:42.472
I THINK THAT HAVING A REGIONAL

01:00:42.538 --> 01:00:44.107
TRANSPORTATION PLAN IS.

01:00:44.173 --> 01:00:46.576
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO TOLD OUR

01:00:46.642 --> 01:00:48.511
GOALS AS THE STATE CITY TO CITY

01:00:48.578 --> 01:00:50.079
LEADERS AND ALSO STATE LEADERS

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:52.181
BUT ONE OF MY CONCERNS AND AND

01:00:52.248 --> 01:00:53.916
AGAIN I I REALLY DO LIKE THIS

01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:54.917
BILL BUT YOU KNOW I JUST WANNA

01:00:54.984 --> 01:00:56.252
MAKE GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:57.320
ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS.

01:00:57.387 --> 01:00:59.389
AS IT PERTAINS TO A SENSITIVE

01:00:59.455 --> 01:01:00.423
DATA INFORMATION AND HOW IT'S

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:01.691
CHAIRED CAN YOU.

01:01:01.758 --> 01:01:02.992
SPEAK TO THAT PLEASE THANK YOU

01:01:03.059 --> 01:01:03.926
SENATOR I REALLY APPRECIATE THE

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:05.561
QUESTION SO THE BILL DOES NOT

01:01:05.628 --> 01:01:07.964
REQUIRE THE SHARING OF DATA DOES

01:01:08.031 --> 01:01:09.132
NOT DICTATE HOW THE DATE IS

01:01:09.198 --> 01:01:10.633
GONNA BE SURE TO DOESN'T DICTATE

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:12.101
WHAT DATA WILL BE SHARED.

01:01:12.168 --> 01:01:13.703
IT JUST GIVES A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:15.438
PARAMETERS SIX TWO C. P. YOU SEE

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:17.507
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY TAKE INTO

01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:19.542
ACCOUNT THE NEEDS OF LOCAL

01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:20.176
AGENCIES.

01:01:20.243 --> 01:01:21.744
SO THE CPUC CERTAINLY WITHIN

01:01:21.811 --> 01:01:23.846
THEIR HEARING WILL TAKE ALL OF

01:01:23.913 --> 01:01:25.448
THESE PRIVACY TO CONCERNS INTO

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:26.816
ACCOUNT AND THEN LIMIT THE DATA

01:01:26.883 --> 01:01:28.584
THAT SHARED THROUGH THEIR

01:01:28.651 --> 01:01:29.886
PROCESS THE BILL DOESN'T SAY TO

01:01:29.952 --> 01:01:31.020
SEE IF YOU SEE.

01:01:31.087 --> 01:01:32.889
YOU MUST REQUIRE UBER TO GIVE

01:01:32.955 --> 01:01:34.657
RAW DATA TO THE AGENCIES IT

01:01:34.724 --> 01:01:36.659
DOESN'T SPECIFY THE LEVEL OF

01:01:36.726 --> 01:01:39.362
SPECIFICITY THAT'S GIVEN IN FACT

01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:41.130
WE FULLY WOULD WANT A C. P. YOU

01:01:41.197 --> 01:01:42.932
SEE TO MAKE SURE THAT PRIVACY IS

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:45.401
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT -- BUT WE ARE

01:01:45.468 --> 01:01:46.402
TRYING TO TELL THEM THOUGH TO

01:01:46.469 --> 01:01:47.937
MAKE SURE THAT THE NEEDS OF THE

01:01:48.004 --> 01:01:50.006
AGENCIES ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT

01:01:50.073 --> 01:01:51.841
WHEN YOU SET THESE RULES.

01:01:51.908 --> 01:01:54.177
WE HAVE BEEN MONITORING THE

01:01:54.243 --> 01:01:54.811
ONGOING HEARINGS THAT THEY'VE

01:01:54.877 --> 01:01:56.446
BEEN HAVING AND THEIR PROCESS

01:01:56.512 --> 01:01:58.214
AND WE FEEL THAT THEY'RE NOT

01:01:58.281 --> 01:02:00.116
TAKING THE AGENCIES NEEDS ARE

01:02:00.183 --> 01:02:01.384
FOR PLANNING INTO ACCOUNT AND

01:02:01.451 --> 01:02:01.584
NOT.

01:02:01.651 --> 01:02:02.485
AND WE'RE JUST TELLING THEM TO

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:04.620
PRIORITIZE THAT WE'RE CERTAINLY

01:02:04.687 --> 01:02:05.888
HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:07.023
AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD MAKE IT

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:08.791
CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO

01:02:08.858 --> 01:02:10.159
GET THEM TO TRUMP CALIFORNIA LAW.

01:02:10.226 --> 01:02:11.694
WHEN IT COMES TO PRIVACY OR TO

01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:13.362
GIVE ANY DATA THAT SO SENSITIVE

01:02:13.429 --> 01:02:15.498
THAT WOULD -- BE OUTSIDE OF

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.967
CALIFORNIA LAW WE WE ABSOLUTELY

01:02:18.034 --> 01:02:19.168
RESPECT THE PRIVACY WORK THAT'S

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:20.069
BEEN DONE THAT'S BEEN PASSED

01:02:20.136 --> 01:02:27.243
LAST YEAR AND WE WOULD FULLY

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:28.478
EXPECT THE CPUC.

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:29.378
TERMINATION SO CERTAINLY THEY'RE

01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:30.146
GOING TO HAVE TO DO A BALANCE

01:02:30.213 --> 01:02:31.180
AND LET ME ALSO SAY -- GLENDALE

01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:31.781
FOR INSTANCE OWNS ALL POWER

01:02:31.848 --> 01:02:33.349
COMPANY THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHEN

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.251
ALL OF THEIR USERS ARE WATCHING

01:02:35.318 --> 01:02:36.819
TELEVISION OR RUNNING THEIR POOL

01:02:36.886 --> 01:02:37.520
PUMP TO THEIR SMART METER

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:40.056
PROGRAM CITIES ARE ABSOLUTELY.

01:02:40.123 --> 01:02:42.024
RIGHT NOW -- HAVE A LOT OF DATA

01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:44.794
THAT ABOUT THEIR CITIZENS -- AT

01:02:44.861 --> 01:02:46.362
THEIR FINGERTIPS AND I DO THINK

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:47.997
THAT WE NEEDBETTER REGULATIONS

01:02:48.064 --> 01:02:49.699
TO MAKE SURE THAT CITIES --

01:02:49.765 --> 01:02:52.935
CONTROL THAT DATA THAT THEY HAVE

01:02:53.002 --> 01:02:58.674
THE ABSOLUTE BEST ARMED ANTI --

01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:00.977
PIRACY AN ANTI HACKING

01:03:01.043 --> 01:03:02.678
TECHNOLOGY AT THEIR FINGERTIPS

01:03:02.745 --> 01:03:03.946
WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT THAT

01:03:04.013 --> 01:03:05.348
HAPPENS WE SHOULD ALSO HAVE

01:03:05.414 --> 01:03:06.082
PARAMETERS ON HOW CITIES ARE

01:03:06.149 --> 01:03:07.683
ABLE TO USE DATA THE SAME WAY

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:08.451
THAT WE SHOULD FOR THE TECH

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:09.352
INDUSTRY.

01:03:09.418 --> 01:03:10.186
BUT THAT'S A DIFFERENT

01:03:10.253 --> 01:03:11.687
CONVERSATION THAT DOESN' THAT

01:03:11.754 --> 01:03:13.189
EXTEND TO THE POINT THAT WE

01:03:13.256 --> 01:03:14.557
SHOULD NEVER GIVE THEM DATA OR

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:16.292
ALLOW THEM TO COLLECTED OR USED

01:03:16.359 --> 01:03:17.660
DATA I THINK THEY'RE REALLY TWO

01:03:17.727 --> 01:03:18.628
DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT ARE

01:03:18.694 --> 01:03:19.929
GETTING CONFUSED HERE.

01:03:19.996 --> 01:03:21.164
IF THEY'RE WORRIED THAT CITIES

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:23.900
DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE A FIRE WALLS

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:25.835
ON THEIR SERVERS THAT'S A

01:03:25.902 --> 01:03:27.570
CONVERSATION THAT WE HAVE THE

01:03:27.637 --> 01:03:28.404
ANSWER TO THAT IS NOT TO SAY

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:29.705
WILL DON'T GIVE THEM ANY DAY

01:03:29.772 --> 01:03:30.540
THAT THEY NEED TO RUN THEIR

01:03:30.606 --> 01:03:33.309
CITIES -- THE SO I I THINK THAT

01:03:33.376 --> 01:03:34.510
THAT'S BEING A LITTLE BIT

01:03:34.577 --> 01:03:36.512
COMPLETED BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT

01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:37.146
CITIES TO HAVE DATA THAT THEY

01:03:37.213 --> 01:03:38.848
DON'T NEED AND THATTHEY CAN USE

01:03:38.915 --> 01:03:40.650
TO TRACK THEIR CITIZENS WE'RE

01:03:40.716 --> 01:03:42.118
NOT TRYING TO REQUIRE THAT AND

01:03:42.185 --> 01:03:43.352
WE CAN CERTAINLY MAKE THAT CLEAR

01:03:43.419 --> 01:03:44.287
IN THE BILL.

01:03:44.353 --> 01:03:46.389
BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF PEOPLE

01:03:46.455 --> 01:03:47.423
ARE USING TNC IS IF THEY'RE

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:49.525
USING UBER TO GET TO A CERTAIN

01:03:49.592 --> 01:03:51.527
LOCATION CONSISTENTLY CITIES

01:03:51.594 --> 01:03:52.929
NEED TO KNOW THAT BECAUSE THEY

01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:53.696
MAY WANT TO RUN A BUS TO THAT

01:03:53.763 --> 01:03:54.564
LOCATION.

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:55.498
OR THEY MAY WANT TO HAVE MORE

01:03:55.565 --> 01:03:57.200
FREQUENT DREAM SERVICE TO THAT

01:03:57.266 --> 01:03:58.768
IN PERMITTED THAT LOCATION IF

01:03:58.834 --> 01:04:00.570
THEY DON'T KNOW WHEN PEOPLE ARE

01:04:00.636 --> 01:04:04.607
TAKING RIDE SHARING AND WHEN AND

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:05.141
WHERE THEY'RE TAKING IT.

01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:07.543
THEY CANNOT PLAN THEIR OWN

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:09.378
TRANSIT SO SOMEWHERE BETWEEN

01:04:09.445 --> 01:04:10.713
THEIR CONCERNS AND MAKING SURE

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:13.382
THAT P. C. P. YOU SEE TAKES THAT.

01:04:13.449 --> 01:04:14.917
GOAL SERIOUSLY IS WHERE THIS

01:04:14.984 --> 01:04:16.219
BILL IS YOU KNOW ATTEMPTING TO

01:04:16.285 --> 01:04:17.620

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:10.706
GETS OUT TODAY SO -- I THINK THE

01:05:10.773 --> 01:05:12.875
PRIVACY ISSUES RESOLVABLE I

01:05:12.942 --> 01:05:15.378
THINK THERE'S A WAY TO HANDLE

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:16.178
THAT I I DO AGREE THAT.

01:05:16.245 --> 01:05:17.480
WHAT WHAT IS DETAILED TRIP

01:05:17.546 --> 01:05:18.748
INFORMATION THAT FEELS OPEN

01:05:18.814 --> 01:05:20.616
ENDED DOESN'T CONCERN ABOUT

01:05:20.683 --> 01:05:21.951
OTHER RELEVANT PARTIES LIKE

01:05:22.018 --> 01:05:22.652

MY I WANT TO TRY TO SOLVE THE

01:05:29.892 --> 01:05:31.527
SAME PROBLEM THAT YOU'RE LOOKING

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:32.762
AT HERE WHICH IS ACTUALLY HAD TO

01:05:32.828 --> 01:05:33.596
DO ACCURATE.

01:05:33.663 --> 01:05:35.598
TRANSPORTATION PLANNING.

01:05:35.665 --> 01:05:37.566
AND THE CONCERN IS IF YOU HAVE.

01:05:37.633 --> 01:05:39.702
I THINK IT'S WHAT 2% OF TRIPS

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:41.304
ARE SO IN AT LEAST IN OUR AREA

01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:44.573
IN THE LA AREA. TWO OR 3% LIKE

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.442
ARE WE GET A FULL PICTURE.

01:05:46.509 --> 01:05:48.611
OUT OF THIS BILL.

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:50.246
FROM JUST LOOKING AT RIDE

01:05:50.313 --> 01:05:51.914
SHARING AND I THIS MAY SOUND

01:05:51.981 --> 01:05:54.050
OVERLY INVASIVE BUT WE DON'T

01:05:54.116 --> 01:05:55.985
KNOW WHAT THE 98% OF THE REST OF

01:05:56.052 --> 01:05:57.586
THE CARS ARE DOING IN LA.

01:05:57.653 --> 01:05:59.522
OR THE TRUCKS RIGHT I THINK OF

01:05:59.588 --> 01:06:01.557
BIG RIGS RUNNING UP THE I FIVE

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:03.192
RUNS AND TENDER.

01:06:03.259 --> 01:06:04.226
YOU KNOW LIKE WHOSE WOULD

01:06:04.293 --> 01:06:06.262
COMMUTE TIME TO TRY TO DO THIS

01:06:06.329 --> 01:06:08.731
TRANSPORTATION MODELING WE DO TO

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:09.765
FOR A VALLEY TRANSIT PATTERNS

01:06:09.832 --> 01:06:10.066
[inaudible]

01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:11.300
SO WITHOUT.

01:06:11.367 --> 01:06:12.835
THAT FULL DATA SET THEN HOW DOES

01:06:12.902 --> 01:06:14.537
THIS.

01:06:14.603 --> 01:06:15.771
WORK I KNOW YOU'RE THINKING

01:06:15.838 --> 01:06:17.340
FIRST MY LAST MILES OR TO

01:06:17.406 --> 01:06:19.375
TRANSIT BASED WANTED.

01:06:19.442 --> 01:06:20.710
ENGAGE ON THAT ONE THANK YOU

01:06:20.776 --> 01:06:22.078
KNOW IT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO

01:06:22.144 --> 01:06:24.413
FIRST OF ALL THE DATA IS NOW

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:26.449
SHOWING THAT IN MAJOR CITIES TNC

01:06:26.515 --> 01:06:28.684
IS OUR ACCOUNTING FOR UP 215% OF

01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:30.586
INTEREST CITY TRIPS.

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:32.188
SO IN SOME AREAS IT MIGHT BE 2%

01:06:32.254 --> 01:06:33.189
BUT IF YOU'RE IN DOWNTOWN LOS

01:06:33.255 --> 01:06:35.291
ANGELES IT COULD MAYBE EVEN BE

01:06:35.358 --> 01:06:36.625
HIGHER THAN 15%.

01:06:36.692 --> 01:06:39.428
SO -- IT'S IMPORTANT THAT CITIES

01:06:39.495 --> 01:06:40.696
UNDERSTAND THAT AND I I AGREE OF

01:06:40.763 --> 01:06:41.697
COURSE YOU WANT TO WERE ALL THE

01:06:41.764 --> 01:06:43.332
CARS ARE GOING BUT TNC USER FOR

01:06:43.399 --> 01:06:44.867
FILLING A VERY SPECIFIC KIND OF

01:06:44.934 --> 01:06:45.735
NEAT I THINK.

01:06:45.801 --> 01:06:46.802
YOU KNOW THERE TEND TO BE GOING

01:06:46.869 --> 01:06:48.471
AND THAT'S THAT'S WHY IT'S

01:06:48.537 --> 01:06:49.238
INTERESTING TO KNOW THAT IN SOME

01:06:49.305 --> 01:06:52.308
PLACES A 50% IN SOME PLACES IT'S

01:06:52.375 --> 01:06:52.475
2%.

01:06:52.541 --> 01:06:57.380
SO WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE -- AND

01:06:57.446 --> 01:06:57.947
IT ARE THEY FOR FILLING THE

01:06:58.013 --> 01:06:59.548
FIRST MILE LAST MILE FUNCTION

01:06:59.615 --> 01:07:00.683
ARE THEY FOR FILLINGS --

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:02.618
FUNCTIONS ABOUT CERTAIN TYPES OF

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:04.153
SPECIAL EVENTS WERE PARKING IS

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:04.854
DIFFICULT.

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:06.889
CITIES NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHY

01:07:06.956 --> 01:07:08.891
PEOPLE ARE TAKING THEM AND WHERE

01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:10.693
AND HOW THEY FIT IN WITH TRANSIT

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:11.861
SO YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT

01:07:11.927 --> 01:07:13.295
THERE'S SOME ON ANSWER QUESTIONS

01:07:13.362 --> 01:07:14.029
HERE BECAUSE THE CITIES DON'T

01:07:14.096 --> 01:07:15.698
HAVE ALWAYSTHE DATA THAT THEY

01:07:15.765 --> 01:07:17.266
NEED TO REALLY BE ARE.

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:18.501
ABLE TO HAVE THAT FULL PICTURE

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:20.636
BUT DO YOU THINK I MEAN ARE YOU

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:21.437
OPEN.

01:07:21.504 --> 01:07:22.638
TO I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I WANT

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:26.208
THIS AMENDMENT FRANKLY BUT BUT

01:07:26.275 --> 01:07:27.643
WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ALL VEHICLE

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:27.877
TRIPS.

01:07:27.943 --> 01:07:28.944
IF IF WE'RE GOING TO GO DOWN

01:07:29.011 --> 01:07:30.212
THIS ROAD WE SHOULD KNOW WHERE

01:07:30.279 --> 01:07:31.480
EVERYONE'S DRIVING NOT JUST

01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:33.182
SHARED VEHICLE.

01:07:33.249 --> 01:07:35.718
THAT THAT'S THE BIG CONCERN.

01:07:35.785 --> 01:07:36.185
YEAH.

01:07:36.252 --> 01:07:37.353
IF TEAM FIRST AS A I WANT TO

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:38.888
KNOW WHERE THE 85% OF OTHERS A

01:07:38.954 --> 01:07:39.488
FOR GOING TO HAVE ACCURATE

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:40.956
MODELING FOR TRANSPORTATION

01:07:41.023 --> 01:07:41.624
SYSTEM.

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:42.825
I THINK THAT A LOT OF THE MORE

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:44.927
SOPHISTICATED TNC CERTAINLY KNOW

01:07:44.994 --> 01:07:46.762
THINGS LIKE THE AMOUNT OF

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:48.197
TRAFFIC ON THE HIGHWAY -- THEY

01:07:48.264 --> 01:07:50.399
HAVE A GENERAL IDEA OF WHERE

01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:51.700
THEY HAVE MORE CONGESTION WHERE

01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:53.002
PEOPLE ARE DRIVING MORE TO JOB

01:07:53.068 --> 01:07:54.336
CENTERS.

01:07:54.403 --> 01:07:58.374
ARE FOR INSTANCE -- SO I THINK

01:07:58.441 --> 01:07:59.942
THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW THE DAY

01:08:00.009 --> 01:08:01.444
THEY DO NEED TO HAVE THAT DATA

01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:02.912
BUT WITHOUT KNOWING HOW WHICH

01:08:02.978 --> 01:08:04.914
NUMBERS OF THOSE CARS ARE TNC

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:06.248
USE THEIR ALSO MISSING A REALLY

01:08:06.315 --> 01:08:07.583
IMPORTANT PART OF THE PICTURE

01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:09.819
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS

01:08:09.885 --> 01:08:14.857
JUST IS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:16.025
YEAH I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT I

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:17.660
KNOW THE METROPOLITAN PLANNING

01:08:17.726 --> 01:08:18.761
ORGANIZATIONS A NUMBER OF FOR

01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:19.862
CERTAINLY REGIONAL

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:21.664
TRANSPORTATION EIGHT AGENCIES.

01:08:21.730 --> 01:08:23.165
ALREADY HAVE THIS IN FROM A LOT

01:08:23.232 --> 01:08:25.768
OF THIS INFORMATION -- BECAUSE

01:08:25.835 --> 01:08:27.336
OF FAST TRACK AND THEY ALREADY

01:08:27.403 --> 01:08:28.871
HAVE STANDARDS AROUND THAT

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:30.506
PRIVACY STANDARDS.

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:31.874
I DON'T THINK THIS IS REALLY

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:33.309
ANYTHING NEW.

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:34.577
FROM THAT STANDPOINT IT JUST

01:08:34.643 --> 01:08:37.680
INCREASES THE DATA SETS AND YOU

01:08:37.746 --> 01:08:39.815
KNOW I I I REALLY DO BELIEVE

01:08:39.882 --> 01:08:42.518
THAT -- THEY CAN YOU CAN PUT THE

01:08:42.585 --> 01:08:45.421
THAT TRANSPARENCY OR THE PRIVACY.

01:08:45.488 --> 01:08:46.422
YOU KNOW POLICIES IN HERE TO

01:08:46.489 --> 01:08:47.857
PROTECT.

01:08:47.923 --> 01:08:49.258
YEAH SAID TO THE DATA

01:08:49.325 --> 01:08:49.658
[inaudible]

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:55.197
THANK YOU.

01:08:55.264 --> 01:08:56.565
THANK YOU I JUST WANTED TO COME

01:08:56.632 --> 01:08:57.967
IF I COULD JUST BRIEFLY I I

01:08:58.033 --> 01:08:59.635
THINK THERE IS A PLACE WHERE YOU

01:08:59.702 --> 01:09:00.269
CAN.

01:09:00.336 --> 01:09:02.238
GET THAT WILL RESOLVE SOME OF

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:04.373
THE ISSUES IN TERMS OF PRIVACY

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.442
AND TO GET TO THAT SWEET SPOT SO

01:09:06.509 --> 01:09:08.310
HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL WITH

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:08.511
FORD.

01:09:08.577 --> 01:09:10.079
BUT I THINK HOPEFULLY IF IT

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:11.080
DOESN'T GET THEIR THEM WE MAY

01:09:11.146 --> 01:09:13.816
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE AND I

01:09:13.883 --> 01:09:14.416
THINK JUST.

01:09:14.483 --> 01:09:14.950
TO THE IT'S AN IMPORTANT

01:09:15.017 --> 01:09:17.686
CONSIDERATION THAT WE REALLY GET

01:09:17.753 --> 01:09:19.622
THE DATA -- BUT THIS IS JUST THE

01:09:19.688 --> 01:09:20.923
BEGINNING BECAUSE I THINK IF

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:23.492
IT'S 15% WILL LOOK AT THE 85%

01:09:23.559 --> 01:09:27.296
AND TRYING. TO TO ACCOMPLISH THE

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:28.564
ACCESSING THAT AN UNDERSTANDING

01:09:28.631 --> 01:09:31.100
THOSE TRAVEL MODELS THAT -- IN

01:09:31.166 --> 01:09:33.035
DOING THAT THERE'S THEIR PRIVACY

01:09:33.102 --> 01:09:34.036
CONCERNS ISSUE THIS COULD BE A

01:09:34.103 --> 01:09:35.504
WAS A PRECEDENT SETTING BUT IT

01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:37.606
COULD BE A MODEL THAT COULD BE

01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:39.575
USED FOR OTHER FORMS AS WELL SO

01:09:39.642 --> 01:09:40.509
I WITH.

01:09:40.576 --> 01:09:42.611
BICYCLES OR SCOOTERS OR

01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:43.846
SOMETHING ELSE SO HOPEFULLY WE

01:09:43.913 --> 01:09:46.982
CAN GET THERE.

01:09:47.049 --> 01:09:48.450
YOU KNOW I I RAN A SIMILAR BILL

01:09:48.517 --> 01:09:50.185
A FEW YEARS BACK BECAUSE THERE

01:09:50.252 --> 01:09:53.155
WERE -- SOME EXAMPLES OUT THERE

01:09:53.222 --> 01:09:55.257
IN THE COMMUNITY.

01:09:55.324 --> 01:09:57.393
THAT SHOWED THAT CERTAIN DURING

01:09:57.459 --> 01:10:00.496
CERTAIN EVENTS THE WORD JUSTICE --

01:10:00.563 --> 01:10:01.530
HUGE GROWTH.

01:10:01.597 --> 01:10:02.698
LIKE IN ONE OF AND ALL OF A

01:10:02.765 --> 01:10:04.700
SUDDEN THEY THEY THEY FLOOD AN

01:10:04.767 --> 01:10:07.269
AREA WITH VEHICLES.

01:10:07.336 --> 01:10:08.837
MORE THAN THAT EVENT ACTUALLY

01:10:08.904 --> 01:10:09.905
NEEDS.

01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:12.474
AND AND NORMALLY HISTORICALLY

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:15.511
CITIES HAVE ALWAYS -- DESIGN

01:10:15.578 --> 01:10:16.979
THEIR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:19.415
AROUND HOW MANY -- FOR HIGHER

01:10:19.481 --> 01:10:20.349
VEHICLES THERE ARE AROUND HOW

01:10:20.416 --> 01:10:23.352
MANY TRAINS AND BUSES.

01:10:23.419 --> 01:10:24.920
AND IN THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT YOU

01:10:24.987 --> 01:10:26.455

SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE

01:18:14.089 --> 01:18:15.690
IS.

01:18:15.757 --> 01:18:19.161
LOAD SERVING ENTITIES -- BY AND

01:18:19.227 --> 01:18:23.999
LARGE ARE -- GOING TO PAY WELL

01:18:24.066 --> 01:18:24.833
THE POINT OF THE BILL IS FOR

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:27.369
THEM TO PAY THE INDIRECT COSTS.

01:18:27.436 --> 01:18:29.604
THAT THEIR PORTFOLIOS IMPOSE ON

01:18:29.671 --> 01:18:32.307
THE ELECTRIC SYSTEMS.

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:34.976
OF WHICH IS TO SEND UP TO AND

01:18:35.043 --> 01:18:36.445
WHAT WE WOULD DO IS SEND A PRICE

01:18:36.511 --> 01:18:38.113
SIGNAL THAT WILL ENCOURAGE A

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:41.249
WELL BALANCED PORTFOLIO TO SERVE

01:18:41.316 --> 01:18:43.218
CUSTOMER LOAD.

01:18:43.285 --> 01:18:46.021
LOAD SERVING ENTITIES -- MAY NOT

01:18:46.088 --> 01:18:47.889
MATCH THEIR ENERGY PURCHASES TO

01:18:47.956 --> 01:18:50.258
THEIR CUSTOMER LOAD PROFILES.

01:18:50.325 --> 01:18:51.526
LEAVING THE CALIFORNIA

01:18:51.593 --> 01:18:53.161
INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR WITH

01:18:53.228 --> 01:18:55.430
RESPONSIBILITY OF ENSURING THAT

01:18:55.497 --> 01:18:57.532
SUFFICIENT SISTER RESOURCES ARE

01:18:57.599 --> 01:18:58.333
AVAILABLE.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.135
THE SERVER LOAD.

01:19:00.202 --> 01:19:02.471
SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS

01:19:02.537 --> 01:19:04.106
IF THE LOAD SERVING AND A D..

01:19:04.172 --> 01:19:06.074
I. IS SHORT ON ENERGY AT SOME

01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:08.677
PARTICULAR DAY OR TIME.

01:19:08.743 --> 01:19:10.445
THAT THE I. SL WILL GO TO THE

01:19:10.512 --> 01:19:13.381
MARKET AND IT WILL.

01:19:13.448 --> 01:19:15.050
CURE WHATEVER ENERGY IS NEEDED

01:19:15.117 --> 01:19:16.618
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE

01:19:16.685 --> 01:19:20.088
BLACKOUTS AS WE DID IN.

01:19:20.155 --> 01:19:20.722
TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE OF

01:19:20.789 --> 01:19:22.090
BY AND LARGE THAT ENERGY WHICH

01:19:22.157 --> 01:19:24.626
WILL BE PURCHASED WILL COME --

01:19:24.693 --> 01:19:27.262
FROM NATURAL GAS AND IT'LL

01:19:27.329 --> 01:19:28.930
PROBABLY COME FROM OUT OF STATE.

01:19:28.997 --> 01:19:30.599
HELLO POTENTIALLY COULD COME

01:19:30.665 --> 01:19:32.501
FROM THE IN STATE AS WELL.

01:19:32.567 --> 01:19:33.602
COULD EVEN COME FROM COAL

01:19:33.668 --> 01:19:36.872
RESOURCES -- BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

01:19:36.938 --> 01:19:39.341
GOING TO ALLOW ANY BLACKOUTS.

01:19:39.407 --> 01:19:40.575
THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN YOU

01:19:40.642 --> 01:19:43.545
PURCHASE THIS ENERGY ON THE SPOT

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:44.045
MARKET CAN BE EXTREMELY

01:19:44.112 --> 01:19:45.247
EXPENSIVE.

01:19:45.313 --> 01:19:47.616
AND WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IS

01:19:47.682 --> 01:19:48.150
THAT.

01:19:48.216 --> 01:19:51.219
THOSE WHO BECAUSE THE SYSTEM. TO

01:19:51.286 --> 01:19:53.355
HAVE TO PAY FOR VERY EXPENSIVE

01:19:53.421 --> 01:19:55.590
ENERGY ON THE SPOT MARKET ALSO

01:19:55.657 --> 01:19:57.792
VERY THE BEAR THE COSTS.

01:19:57.859 --> 01:20:00.529
RIGHT NOW THOSE COSTS ARE SIMPLY

01:20:00.595 --> 01:20:02.731
ALLOCATED BASED UPON LOW CHAIR

01:20:02.797 --> 01:20:04.332
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:20:04.399 --> 01:20:07.402
ACTUAL ENTITY WHICH DEMANDED

01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:12.174
THOSE COSTS -- WOULD IN FACT.

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:13.675
OF PAY FOR THOSE COSTS SO IT

01:20:13.742 --> 01:20:18.747
GIVES A CRISIS PRICE SIGNAL TO

01:20:18.813 --> 01:20:21.716
THE MARKET -- THE ALTERNATIVE IS

01:20:21.783 --> 01:20:23.518
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR LOAD

01:20:23.585 --> 01:20:24.853
SERVING ENERGY HAS.

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:28.657
ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS STORAGE ARE

01:20:28.723 --> 01:20:30.258
OR SOME OTHER SORT OF BACK UP

01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:36.665
POWER -- BATTERIES -- PUMP HYDRO

01:20:36.731 --> 01:20:38.900
ET CETERA [inaudible]

ENERGIES PAY THEIR SHARE THE

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:48.243
INDIRECT COSTS.

GOOD MORNING.

01:22:11.226 --> 01:22:12.460
A MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF MY

01:22:12.527 --> 01:22:13.862
NAME IS SHANNON EDDIE I'M

01:22:13.928 --> 01:22:15.630
REPRESENTING THE LARGE SCALE

01:22:15.697 --> 01:22:17.465
SOLAR ASSOCIATION TODAY.

01:22:17.532 --> 01:22:19.634
IN OPPOSITION TO FIFTEEN EIGHTY

01:22:19.701 --> 01:22:20.302
FOUR I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:22:20.368 --> 01:22:22.671
ABOUT OUR CONCERNS -- THIS BILL

01:22:22.737 --> 01:22:24.172
WOULD FORCE THE PC TO IMPLEMENT

01:22:24.239 --> 01:22:25.974
AN APPROACH THAT CAL WE A HAS

01:22:26.041 --> 01:22:27.242
PROPOSED MULTIPLE TIMES IN THAT

01:22:27.309 --> 01:22:29.611
THE PC HAS REJECTED EACH TIME

01:22:29.678 --> 01:22:30.912
PRETTY MUCH OUT OF HAND.

01:22:30.979 --> 01:22:31.946
IN THE SIMPLEST TERMS IT WOULD

01:22:32.013 --> 01:22:33.581
PENALIZE THE ELLIS'S THAT HAVE A

01:22:33.648 --> 01:22:35.250
LARGER SOLAR IN INTERMITTENCY

01:22:35.317 --> 01:22:36.651
PORTFOLIO.

01:22:36.718 --> 01:22:38.720
BY SHIFTING AN EXTRA COST BURDEN

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:41.690
TO THEM VIA THE ARE A PROGRAM.

01:22:41.756 --> 01:22:42.724
THE PREMISE BEHIND THE BILL IS

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:44.292
THAT CILLER CREATES INTEGRATION

01:22:44.359 --> 01:22:46.695
PROBLEMS THAT SHOULD BE REMEDIED

01:22:46.761 --> 01:22:49.898
BY CHANGING HOW ARE A IS PAID.

01:22:49.964 --> 01:22:50.832
FOR WHEN IN REALITY WHAT WE'RE

01:22:50.899 --> 01:22:51.700
SEEING IS IN SO MUCH AS A

01:22:51.766 --> 01:22:53.268
PROBLEM AS A TRANSITION IN THE

01:22:53.335 --> 01:22:54.736
MARKET AND THAT DESERVES MUCH

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.638
MORE THOUGHT THAN ON WHAT A

01:22:56.705 --> 01:22:56.905
CURSORY.

01:22:56.971 --> 01:22:58.740
QUICK CHANGE TO THE ARE A

01:22:58.807 --> 01:23:00.275
PROGRAM WOULD MERIT.

01:23:00.342 --> 01:23:01.643
WE HAVE FOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE

01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:02.410
BILL THAT I WANT TO BREAK DOWN

01:23:02.477 --> 01:23:03.778
FIRST IT WOULD UNNECESSARILY

01:23:03.845 --> 01:23:05.447
COMPLICATE BOTH THE I. R. P. AND

01:23:05.513 --> 01:23:06.815
THE ARE YOU PROGRAM.

01:23:06.881 --> 01:23:08.583
IT WOULD DISTRACT THE PC STAFF

01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:10.218
AWAY FROM THEIR PRIORITIES IT

01:23:10.285 --> 01:23:11.386
WOULD DISINCENTIVE EYES ELLIS

01:23:11.453 --> 01:23:14.522
SEES FROM FROM OVER PROCURING

01:23:14.589 --> 01:23:15.757
WIND AND SOLAR.

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:16.591
AT A TIME WHEN OVER BUILDING

01:23:16.658 --> 01:23:19.127
BOTH IS BEGINNING TO EMERGE --

01:23:19.194 --> 01:23:20.562
AS A KEY SOLUTION TO DE A TODO

01:23:20.628 --> 01:23:22.664
CARBONIZED THREAD -- AND IT

01:23:22.731 --> 01:23:24.466
COULD PENALIZE ELLIS SEES WITH

01:23:24.532 --> 01:23:27.569
CLEANER PORTFOLIOS -- AND REWARD

01:23:27.635 --> 01:23:29.471
THOSE WITH MORE GAS IN THEIR

01:23:29.537 --> 01:23:31.306
PORTFOLIOS.

01:23:31.373 --> 01:23:32.474
SO THE BILL'S SPONSORS SAY THAT

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.542
THE PC WOULD LIKELY USE A COST

01:23:34.609 --> 01:23:35.944
CAUSATION METHODOLOGY DEVELOP BY

01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:37.679
THE CHI SO HOWEVER COUPLE THINGS

01:23:37.746 --> 01:23:38.847
ARE IMPORTANT TO NOTE HERE FIRST

01:23:38.913 --> 01:23:40.181
THE METHODOLOGY WAS CREATED

01:23:40.248 --> 01:23:41.983
PRIOR TO THE EMERGENCE OF MANY

01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:43.785
OF THE CCA'S THAT ARE OPERATING

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:45.019
TODAY.

01:23:45.086 --> 01:23:46.621
AND SECOND THE PC IS ALREADY

01:23:46.688 --> 01:23:48.156
ADDRESSING ARI PROCUREMENT AND

01:23:48.223 --> 01:23:50.091
THE R. P. PROCESS -- THEY JUST

01:23:50.158 --> 01:23:52.160
RECENTLY PROPOSED DIRECTING THE

01:23:52.227 --> 01:23:54.629
LSTS TO PROCURE ARE A VIA THE

01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:57.365
NEW PROCUREMENT TRACK -- WITH

01:23:57.432 --> 01:23:58.566
THE I. R. P. JUST GETTING TO ITS

01:23:58.633 --> 01:24:00.135
FIRST IMPLEMENTATION PHASE IT'S

01:24:00.201 --> 01:24:01.136
JUST STARTING THIS IS THE FIRST

01:24:01.202 --> 01:24:02.404
TIME IT'S DONE THIS -- WE

01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:04.139
BELIEVE IT'S MORE PRUDENT. TO

01:24:04.205 --> 01:24:05.573
LET THE PC DO ITS WORK

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:06.741
UNHINDERED BY SPECIAL INTEREST

01:24:06.808 --> 01:24:10.078
BILLS -- IN ADDITION THE ARI THE

01:24:10.145 --> 01:24:11.379
ART RESOURCE ADEQUACY IS A IN

01:24:11.446 --> 01:24:12.947
UNDERGOING A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT

01:24:13.014 --> 01:24:14.015
CHANGE RIGHT NOW WHAT THEY'RE

01:24:14.082 --> 01:24:15.049
DOING IS MOVING TO THREE YEAR

01:24:15.116 --> 01:24:16.251
FORWARD PROCUREMENT AND THEY'RE

01:24:16.317 --> 01:24:17.952
LOOKING AT CENTRALIZED

01:24:18.019 --> 01:24:20.288
PROCUREMENT FOR OUR A SO THIS IS

01:24:20.355 --> 01:24:21.423
GOING TO BE AN ALREADY

01:24:21.489 --> 01:24:23.024
COMPLICATED ISSUE WHEN YOU'VE

01:24:23.091 --> 01:24:23.291
GOT SO.

01:24:23.358 --> 01:24:25.527
MANY CCA'S IN PLAY IN THE MARKET

01:24:25.593 --> 01:24:26.261
RIGHT NOW.

01:24:26.327 --> 01:24:27.796
AND THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE

01:24:27.862 --> 01:24:30.131
PC TO CREATE A NEW FORMULA THAT

01:24:30.198 --> 01:24:31.666
ANNUALLY ASSESSES EACH.

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:33.368
EACH LSE WITHIN A THREE YEAR

01:24:33.435 --> 01:24:35.470
FORWARD MARKET -- WHICH IS GOING

01:24:35.537 --> 01:24:37.172
TO COMPLICATE THINGS BEFORE THE

01:24:37.238 --> 01:24:39.908
PROCESS EVEN GET STARTED.

01:24:39.974 --> 01:24:41.476
BY ALL APPEARANCES IT SO BY ALL

01:24:41.543 --> 01:24:43.478
APPEARANCES BASED ON WHAT CAL WE

01:24:43.545 --> 01:24:44.512
IS -- ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN IN THE

01:24:44.579 --> 01:24:47.615
PC HISTORICALLY AND ALSO WHAT

01:24:47.682 --> 01:24:49.350
THE WHAT THE EXCUSE ME THE THE

01:24:49.417 --> 01:24:51.019
BILL ANALYSIS POINTS OUT.

01:24:51.085 --> 01:24:52.220
THIS IT APPEARS OF THIS BILL IS

01:24:52.287 --> 01:24:54.722
INTENDED TO INCENT PROCUREMENT.

01:24:54.789 --> 01:24:56.958
OF A SPECIFIC SET OF RESOURCES

01:24:57.025 --> 01:24:58.793
AND AGAIN THIS IS UNNECESSARY

01:24:58.860 --> 01:24:59.627
LITTLE ONE TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:24:59.694 --> 01:25:00.061
ABOUT WHY.

01:25:00.128 --> 01:25:01.463
FIRST THE I. R. P. IS ALREADY

01:25:01.529 --> 01:25:03.598
PROJECTING THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED

01:25:03.665 --> 01:25:05.266
TEN GIGAWATTS OF OF NEW

01:25:05.333 --> 01:25:06.768
RENEWABLE ENERGY BY.

01:25:06.835 --> 01:25:07.235
TWENTY THIRTY THAT'S

01:25:07.302 --> 01:25:08.403
CONSERVATIVE BYA LOT OF

01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:11.739
ESTIMATES INCLUDING THE IPCC.

01:25:11.806 --> 01:25:14.776
AS WE WORK -- TO AS WERE TO THE

01:25:14.843 --> 01:25:16.478
CARBON EYES WERE WE'RE SEEING A

01:25:16.544 --> 01:25:18.246
NEW ERA WHERE THE GREAT IS GONNA

01:25:18.313 --> 01:25:18.913
LOOK VERY DIFFERENT THAN IT

01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:19.914
LOOKS TODAY.

01:25:19.981 --> 01:25:21.015
AND WE'RE GONNA BE A LOT MORE

01:25:21.082 --> 01:25:22.517
POWER ON THE GRID.

01:25:22.584 --> 01:25:24.018
THERE ARE MULTIPLE MODELING

01:25:24.085 --> 01:25:25.086
EFFORTS UNDERWAY RIGHT NOW AND I

01:25:25.153 --> 01:25:26.287
WANT TO POINT TO ONE THAT JUST

01:25:26.354 --> 01:25:28.056
CAME OUT THAT THAT GIVES US A

01:25:28.122 --> 01:25:29.824
GOOD SNAPSHOT.

01:25:29.891 --> 01:25:31.593
CALPINE RECENTLY COMMISSIONED --

01:25:31.659 --> 01:25:34.562
E. THREE TO DO AN ANALYSIS OF

01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:37.565
LONG RUN ARE A AND WHAT WE NEED

01:25:37.632 --> 01:25:39.601
UNDER A LONG -- UNDER THAT LONG

01:25:39.667 --> 01:25:41.603
TERM TO CARBONIZATION PATHWAY.

01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:42.804
NOW THE ANALYSIS ITSELF WAS

01:25:42.871 --> 01:25:44.138
DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY THE ROLE OF

01:25:44.205 --> 01:25:45.673
GAS GENERATION BUT WHAT IT

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:47.141
REALLY DID WAS REMIND US OF JUST

01:25:47.208 --> 01:25:48.810
HOW DIFFERENT OUR GREAT IS GONNA

01:25:48.877 --> 01:25:50.044
LOOK IN TWENTY FIFTY AND HOW

01:25:50.111 --> 01:25:51.279
MUCH RENEWABLE ENERGY WE'RE

01:25:51.346 --> 01:25:52.780
GONNA NEED BY THEN.

01:25:52.847 --> 01:25:54.048
IT ESTIMATES THAT CALIFORNIA

01:25:54.115 --> 01:25:55.550
ONLY TO MAX OUT.

01:25:55.617 --> 01:25:56.384
IN AN AND THIS IS JUST SO

01:25:56.451 --> 01:25:58.119
IMPORTANT IT'S GOING TO MAX OUT

01:25:58.186 --> 01:25:59.587
ALL AVAILABLE RESOURCES ALL

01:25:59.654 --> 01:26:01.456
AVAILABLE RECENT RENEWABLE

01:26:01.523 --> 01:26:03.224
RESOURCES IN CALIFORNIA.

01:26:03.291 --> 01:26:04.659
NON SOLAR IT'LL MAX OUT ALL THE

01:26:04.726 --> 01:26:06.394
IN STATE WHEN IT'S GOING TO MAX

01:26:06.461 --> 01:26:07.795
OUT AT A STATE WIND ALL

01:26:07.862 --> 01:26:09.797
GEOTHERMAL ALL BIOMASS.

01:26:09.864 --> 01:26:12.100
EVERYTHING WE CAN FIND.

01:26:12.166 --> 01:26:13.501
EVEN ON TOP OF THAT IT ESTIMATES

01:26:13.568 --> 01:26:15.470
WERE GONNA NEED FIFTY FIVE

01:26:15.537 --> 01:26:19.173
THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR BY.

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:19.674
TWENTY FORTY EIGHTY NINE

01:26:19.741 --> 01:26:21.209
THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR BY

01:26:21.276 --> 01:26:21.509
[inaudible]

01:26:21.576 --> 01:26:23.278
TWENTY FIFTY CONSERVATIVELY.

01:26:23.344 --> 01:26:24.312
AND AGAIN SOLAR IS UNIQUE

01:26:24.379 --> 01:26:25.613
BECAUSE IT CAN BE CITED

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.582
VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE TO PRODUCE

01:26:27.649 --> 01:26:28.950
POWER AND SO IT'S ANTICIPATED TO

01:26:29.017 --> 01:26:29.784
FILL IN.

01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:31.486
AFTER WE BASICALLY OPTIMIZED

01:26:31.553 --> 01:26:33.154
EVERYTHING WE HAVE.

01:26:33.221 --> 01:26:34.656
THE TRUTH IS WE DON'T NEED

01:26:34.722 --> 01:26:37.058
ENHANCED ARE A RULES. TO INCENT

01:26:37.125 --> 01:26:38.026
PROCUREMENT OR OTHERWISE

01:26:38.092 --> 01:26:39.894
CONVINCE THE LSE'S TO PROCURE IN

01:26:39.961 --> 01:26:40.995
A CERTAIN WAY PRETTY SOON

01:26:41.062 --> 01:26:42.564
CALIFORNIA'S GONNA BE BUYING

01:26:42.630 --> 01:26:43.865
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING WE HAVE

01:26:43.932 --> 01:26:46.868
IT'S GOING TO NEED.

01:26:46.935 --> 01:26:47.769
TO THE OTHER THING THAT WE'RE

01:26:47.835 --> 01:26:50.238
LEARNING IS THAT -- SOLAR AND

01:26:50.305 --> 01:26:50.538
WIND.

01:26:50.605 --> 01:26:51.205
WE'RE WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT

01:26:51.272 --> 01:26:53.007
SOLAR AND WIND OVER BUILDING

01:26:53.074 --> 01:26:53.741
CURTAILMENT.

01:26:53.808 --> 01:26:55.243
THERE ARE SOME NEW STUDIES ABOUT

01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:58.112
THIS AS WELL -- THERE ARE MAJOR

01:26:58.179 --> 01:26:59.581
COST BENEFITS THAT ARE MERGING

01:26:59.647 --> 01:27:01.015
TO THE OVERBILLED OF BOTH SOLAR

01:27:01.082 --> 01:27:02.350
AND WIND SO PATH TOWARDS THE

01:27:02.417 --> 01:27:03.685
CARBONIZATION.

01:27:03.751 --> 01:27:04.786
AND IT'S FULLY UNDERSTANDING

01:27:04.852 --> 01:27:07.088
THAT YES CURTAILMENT WILL GROW

01:27:07.155 --> 01:27:09.090
BUT THE CURTAILMENT IS A TOOL

01:27:09.157 --> 01:27:10.391
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

01:27:10.458 --> 01:27:12.060
AND IT'S THANKS IN PART TO HELLO

01:27:12.126 --> 01:27:13.394
ACOSTA RESOURCES ARE EVEN THE

01:27:13.461 --> 01:27:14.729
CAL PLAN REPORT SHOWS THAT WE

01:27:14.796 --> 01:27:16.564
COULD SEE TEN TO TWENTY OR

01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:18.533
10212% CURTAILMENT AND STILL

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:19.467
ECONOMICAL FROM THE REPAIR

01:27:19.534 --> 01:27:21.436
PERSPECTIVE.

01:27:21.502 --> 01:27:23.237
SO I TALK ABOUT THE STUDIES AS A

01:27:23.304 --> 01:27:24.439
WAY TO HELP US ALL UNDERSTAND

01:27:24.505 --> 01:27:26.441
THAT THAT WE'RE ONLY JUST NOW

01:27:26.507 --> 01:27:27.208
BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT A

01:27:27.275 --> 01:27:28.409
FULLY DE CARBONIZED GREAT IT'S

01:27:28.476 --> 01:27:30.111
GOING TO BE LOOKING LIKE WE JUST

01:27:30.178 --> 01:27:31.746
DON'T KNOW XACTLY WHAT THE WHAT

01:27:31.813 --> 01:27:32.814
THE KEY PIECES ARE.

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:34.382
WE'RE BOTH WITNESSED AND

01:27:34.449 --> 01:27:36.517
PARTICIPANTS IN A VERY FLUID OF

01:27:36.584 --> 01:27:38.152
MARKET EVOLUTION.

01:27:38.219 --> 01:27:38.786
SO WE NEED TO KEEP OUR EYE ON

01:27:38.853 --> 01:27:39.887
THE BALL BECAUSE THERE'S A

01:27:39.954 --> 01:27:40.488
THERE'S A LOT HAPPENING RIGHT

01:27:40.555 --> 01:27:41.856
NOW.

01:27:41.923 --> 01:27:43.424
RATHER THAN DEVOTING THE LIMITED

01:27:43.491 --> 01:27:44.626
STATE STAFFING RESOURCES TO

01:27:44.692 --> 01:27:46.527
CREATING BOUTIQUE ARE A FORMULAS

01:27:46.594 --> 01:27:47.929
FOR DIFFERENT HELICES BASED ON

01:27:47.996 --> 01:27:49.631
AN OLD GRAD MODEL.

01:27:49.697 --> 01:27:51.633
LET'S INSTEAD WITH THE PC FOCUS

01:27:51.699 --> 01:27:53.534
ON THE TASK AT HAND.

01:27:53.601 --> 01:27:55.403
WILDFIRE LIABILITY UTILITY

01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:56.638
SAFETY PROTOCOLS UTILITY

01:27:56.704 --> 01:27:57.772
SOLVENCY AND LOW SHIFTING

01:27:57.839 --> 01:27:59.340
MECHANICS.

01:27:59.407 --> 01:28:00.642
ONCE WE GET A HANDLE ON THAT

01:28:00.708 --> 01:28:01.442
WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS

01:28:01.509 --> 01:28:02.844
START PROCURING AS MUCH

01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:04.812
RENEWABLE ENERGY AS POSSIBLE AS

01:28:04.879 --> 01:28:06.614
FAST AS POSSIBLE.

01:28:06.681 --> 01:28:07.582
THE WELL INTENDED WE DO

01:28:07.649 --> 01:28:08.683
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A WELL

01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:10.752
INTENDED BILL IT DOES NOT HELP

01:28:10.818 --> 01:28:11.719
WITH ANY OF OUR PRESENT OR

01:28:11.786 --> 01:28:14.055
FUTURE CHALLENGES WE BELIEVE WE

01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:15.156
BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO DISTRACT

01:28:15.223 --> 01:28:16.691
IF YOU SEE STAFF DISRUPT THE

01:28:16.758 --> 01:28:18.793
PROCUREMENT PROCESS AND WE

01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:19.727
RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO OPPOSE

01:28:19.794 --> 01:28:20.695
THE BILL [inaudible]

01:28:20.762 --> 01:28:23.698
THANKS.

01:28:23.765 --> 01:28:24.932
MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TONY HUNTER

01:28:24.999 --> 01:28:27.001
ON BEHALF OF THE SOLAR ENERGY

01:28:27.068 --> 01:28:28.536
INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION OR

01:28:28.603 --> 01:28:29.604
ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH THOSE

01:28:29.671 --> 01:28:31.272
OF SAN ANDY AT LSA.

01:28:31.339 --> 01:28:32.874
AND FURTHER ITERATE AGAIN THE

01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:35.710
BILL IS NOT NECESSARY WE SEE

01:28:35.777 --> 01:28:36.310
THIS INSTRUCTION WE ASK FOR NO

01:28:36.377 --> 01:28:37.578
VOTE [inaudible]

01:28:37.645 --> 01:28:39.580
OKAY [inaudible]

01:28:39.647 --> 01:28:41.582
OUR MEMBERS.

01:28:41.649 --> 01:28:42.917
DID YOU WANNA RESPOND

01:28:42.984 --> 01:28:43.618
[inaudible]

01:28:43.685 --> 01:28:45.620
TO SURE.

01:28:45.687 --> 01:28:47.288
ARM FIRST OF ALL THIS IS A

01:28:47.355 --> 01:28:49.524
MARKET SOLUTION SO ONCE IT'S IN

01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:51.459
PLACE IT REQUIRES -- NO

01:28:51.526 --> 01:28:54.262
ATTENTION BY THE P. YOU SEE.

01:28:54.328 --> 01:28:55.930
THE BILL IS TECH NEUTRAL EFFECT

01:28:55.997 --> 01:28:57.498
IF.

01:28:57.565 --> 01:28:58.800
LOAD SERVING AND HE WANTS TO

01:28:58.866 --> 01:29:00.301
HAVE LOTS AND LOTS OF SOLAR AND

01:29:00.368 --> 01:29:01.602
STORAGE.

01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:04.005
AND THAT WORKS THAT'S JUST FINE

01:29:04.072 --> 01:29:06.174
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE THAT

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:08.076
TALKS ABOUT TECHNOLOGY -- I WILL

01:29:08.142 --> 01:29:11.579
POINT OUT THAT THE NEWEST --

01:29:11.646 --> 01:29:12.847
PLAYERS IN THIS AREA THE CAL

01:29:12.914 --> 01:29:15.149
CCA'S THAT THEIR ASSOCIATIONS

01:29:15.216 --> 01:29:17.085
NEUTRAL ON THE BELL.

01:29:17.151 --> 01:29:18.519
ARE THEN I'M GOING TO DISAGREE

01:29:18.586 --> 01:29:20.755
RESPECTFULLY WITH THE OPPOSITION

01:29:20.822 --> 01:29:22.623
IN THEIR STATEMENT.

01:29:22.690 --> 01:29:25.993
THAT -- THE CPUC HAS REJECTED

01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:27.595
OUR THIS APPROACH.

01:29:27.662 --> 01:29:31.332
OUR FIRST OF ALL.

01:29:31.399 --> 01:29:32.400
THE BILL WOULD ONLY DIRECT THE

01:29:32.467 --> 01:29:35.136
SHIP CPUS SHE'D ALLOCATE ANY ANY.

01:29:35.203 --> 01:29:37.638
INTEGRATION RESOURCE OBLIGATIONS

01:29:37.705 --> 01:29:40.241
THAT THEY ESTABLISH OUR SUCH AS

01:29:40.308 --> 01:29:41.876
FLEXIBLE RESOURCE.

01:29:41.943 --> 01:29:45.580
ADEQUACY -- WAIT A SECOND THIS

01:29:45.646 --> 01:29:48.082
IS THE WRONG SECTION.

01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:50.418
WELL THE POINT IS THAT THE CPUC

01:29:50.485 --> 01:29:53.087
HAS NEVER REJECTED THIS APPROACH

01:29:53.154 --> 01:29:54.722
AND IN FACT THEY'VE SAID THAT

01:29:54.789 --> 01:29:56.357
IT'S A PREFERRED APPROACH.

01:29:56.424 --> 01:30:00.561
ARE THEY JUST HAVE NOT --

01:30:00.628 --> 01:30:02.196
DECIDED TO NOT TAKE THIS

01:30:02.263 --> 01:30:03.231
APPROACH YET.

01:30:03.297 --> 01:30:04.766
WE'RE GOING TO ASK HIM TO MAKE

01:30:04.832 --> 01:30:06.667
THAT A PRIORITY SO WE WILL GET

01:30:06.734 --> 01:30:09.003
THE APPROPRIATE.

01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:10.104
MODELS HE'S ME THE APPROPRIATE

01:30:10.171 --> 01:30:11.939
MARKET SIGNAL WHICH WILL BE A

01:30:12.006 --> 01:30:13.541
VERY EFFICIENT WAY TO MAKE SURE

01:30:13.608 --> 01:30:14.909
THAT PEOPLE HAVE BALLOTS

01:30:14.976 --> 01:30:17.378
PORTFOLIOS AGAIN THAT COULD BE

01:30:17.445 --> 01:30:17.578
DONE.

01:30:17.645 --> 01:30:19.347
EASILY WITH OVER BUILDING SOLAR

01:30:19.413 --> 01:30:22.884
AND HAVING STORAGE WHATEVER

01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:24.152
APPROACH WILL BE JUST FINE.

01:30:24.218 --> 01:30:26.654
VERY WELL A MEMBERS [inaudible]

01:30:26.721 --> 01:30:28.055
CENTER STERN.

01:30:28.122 --> 01:30:29.357
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK

01:30:29.423 --> 01:30:30.658
YOU SIMILAR FOR ENGAGING ON THE

01:30:30.725 --> 01:30:32.226
ISSUE I KNOW WE'VE BEEN.

01:30:32.293 --> 01:30:33.628
CONCERNED ABOUT THE DUCK CURVE

01:30:33.694 --> 01:30:36.030
FOR MANY YEARS AND THE IMPACT

01:30:36.097 --> 01:30:36.497
IT'S HAD.

01:30:36.564 --> 01:30:37.732
BUT I JUST.

01:30:37.799 --> 01:30:39.767
I READ THESE RECENT REPORTS SOME

01:30:39.834 --> 01:30:41.936
OF THE ONES YOU CITED IN.

01:30:42.003 --> 01:30:43.204
I'M STRUGGLING WITH THE WHOLE

01:30:43.271 --> 01:30:45.673
PREMISE OF OVER BUILDING BEING A

01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:47.842
PROBLEM BECAUSE IT'S NOT.

01:30:47.909 --> 01:30:50.244
RIGHT AND SO THE QUESTION FOR

01:30:50.311 --> 01:30:52.346
YOU IS HOW.

01:30:52.413 --> 01:30:54.215
IF CURTAILMENT ENDS UP BEING A

01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:55.683
COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION FOR THE

01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:58.686
FUTURE OF THE GRID.

01:30:58.753 --> 01:31:01.656
AND WHAT I I WAS JUST READING

01:31:01.722 --> 01:31:03.324
CLEAN POWER RESEARCH I THINK AT

01:31:03.391 --> 01:31:04.659
A RECENT STUDY.

01:31:04.725 --> 01:31:05.760
AND THERE WERE A FEW OTHERS

01:31:05.827 --> 01:31:08.062
MENTIONED I THINK YOU.

01:31:08.129 --> 01:31:09.697
THREE BUT TO SAY THAT.

01:31:09.764 --> 01:31:12.133
IT'S ACTUALLY CHEAPER TO OVER

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:16.504
GENERATE SOLAR -- AT PEAK HOURS

01:31:16.571 --> 01:31:17.839
AND AND CURTAIL WHEN NEEDED

01:31:17.905 --> 01:31:22.510
VERSES -- UNDER BUILDING AND

01:31:22.577 --> 01:31:23.578
THEN TRYING TO MEET THAT WITH

01:31:23.644 --> 01:31:27.582
OTHER BIG INFRASTRUCTURE -- OR

01:31:27.648 --> 01:31:29.317
FIND I NEED TO GET YOUR TAKE ON

01:31:29.383 --> 01:31:30.518
AS RHEINISCHE COMPLETE AGREEMENT

01:31:30.585 --> 01:31:31.018
THAT.

01:31:31.085 --> 01:31:32.687
IF OVER BUILDING IS THE RIGHT

01:31:32.753 --> 01:31:34.021
WAY TO GO.

01:31:34.088 --> 01:31:37.625
AS LONG AS YOU HAVE RESOURCES OF

01:31:37.692 --> 01:31:38.926
TIME WHEN THE SUN IS NOT UP.

01:31:38.993 --> 01:31:40.228
I'M FINE WITH THAT YOU CAN YOU

01:31:40.294 --> 01:31:41.762
CAN BUILD.

01:31:41.829 --> 01:31:44.232
AS MUCH SOLAR AS YOU WANT.

01:31:44.298 --> 01:31:45.499
YOU JUST HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

01:31:45.566 --> 01:31:47.568
SERVE THE LOAD WHEN THE SUN GOES

01:31:47.635 --> 01:31:49.570
DOWN AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T

01:31:49.637 --> 01:31:53.875
GO TO THE I. SL WHICH THEN WOULD.

01:31:53.941 --> 01:31:56.510
WOULD LIKELY PURCHASE NATURAL

01:31:56.577 --> 01:31:58.112
GAS BACK UP.

01:31:58.179 --> 01:31:58.980
PROBABLY FROM OUT OF STATE

01:31:59.046 --> 01:32:00.882
PERHAPS EVEN CALL AND THAT'S

01:32:00.948 --> 01:32:02.250
WHAT WE WANT TO PREVENT.

01:32:02.316 --> 01:32:03.551
AND SO FUNCTIONAL BECAUSE THIS

01:32:03.618 --> 01:32:04.919
IS A SHALL WRITE THIS THIS

01:32:04.986 --> 01:32:08.589
DOESN'T GIVE THEM ANY DISCRETION.

01:32:08.656 --> 01:32:09.423
TO ADOPT THIS FRAMEWORK THIS IS

01:32:09.490 --> 01:32:11.626
A SO IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY BUT IT

01:32:11.692 --> 01:32:13.127
SAYS IS THAT THEY SHOULD ADOPT

01:32:13.194 --> 01:32:14.795
THE METHODOLOGY WE DON'T SAY

01:32:14.862 --> 01:32:16.898
EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS OTHER THAN

01:32:16.964 --> 01:32:18.432
THAT HE'S TRIBUNE YET.

01:32:18.499 --> 01:32:22.036
ACCORDING -- TO PEOPLE'S DEMANDS

01:32:22.103 --> 01:32:24.005
FOR THAT POWER SAID THAT THOSE

01:32:24.071 --> 01:32:26.173
WHO PAY. TO GO ON TO THE SPOT

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:28.542
MARKET GET THOSE HIGHER PRICES

01:32:28.609 --> 01:32:30.811
POTENTIALLY EVEN FROM COAL THAT

01:32:30.878 --> 01:32:33.948
THOSE PEOPLE PAY THE PRICE.

01:32:34.015 --> 01:32:35.650
SO WHATEVER LOAD SERVING ENERGY

01:32:35.716 --> 01:32:38.719
THAT IS THIS IS A MARKET SIGNAL.

01:32:38.786 --> 01:32:39.754
BUT BY THE WAY IT SHOULD BE A

01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:41.689
SMALL FRACTION OF THE TOTAL

01:32:41.756 --> 01:32:43.591
ENERGY.

01:32:43.658 --> 01:32:46.494
SHARE A MY EXPERT NAY LIKE AT A

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:47.228
POINT JUST ON THE POINT OF

01:32:47.295 --> 01:32:48.029
CURTAILMENT THIS DOESN'T THIS

01:32:48.095 --> 01:32:49.830
DOESN'T ADDRESS -- ANY IT

01:32:49.897 --> 01:32:51.198
DOESN'T SAY YOU CANNOT CURTAIL

01:32:51.265 --> 01:32:53.200
WHEN ITIS ECONOMIC TO CURTAIL

01:32:53.267 --> 01:32:54.769
WHAT IT SAYS IS IF THE P. YOU

01:32:54.835 --> 01:32:56.671
SEE IN THE R. P. PROCESS.

01:32:56.737 --> 01:32:58.572
DETERMINES THAT IT IS OVERALL

01:32:58.639 --> 01:33:00.608
ECONOMIC TO SAY BUILD A PUMP

01:33:00.675 --> 01:33:02.777
STORAGE FACILITY TO COLLECT THAT

01:33:02.843 --> 01:33:06.547
LOST ENERGY BECAUSE NOW WE'RE-LOSING SO MUCH THAT IT IS WORTH

01:33:06.614 --> 01:33:07.615
WHILE. TO TO BUILD A PUMP

01:33:07.682 --> 01:33:08.616
STORAGE FACILITY.

01:33:08.683 --> 01:33:12.119
THAT THAT FACILITY BE PAID --

01:33:12.186 --> 01:33:15.156
FOR BY EIGHT LSE IS ON THE BASIS

01:33:15.222 --> 01:33:17.258
OF THAT THEY ARE USING IT SO IF

01:33:17.325 --> 01:33:18.993
YOU'RE IF YOU IF YOU HAVE A VERY

01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:21.095
IN BALANCED PORTFOLIO THAT IS

01:33:21.162 --> 01:33:22.530
CAUSED A NEED FOR THAT.

01:33:22.596 --> 01:33:24.665
STORAGE YOU PAY MORE THAN

01:33:24.732 --> 01:33:26.267
SOMEBODY FOR EXAMPLE PENINSULA

01:33:26.334 --> 01:33:28.269
CLEAN ENERGY HAS A GOAL OF

01:33:28.336 --> 01:33:30.204
MATCHING THEIR RESOURCES THEIR

01:33:30.271 --> 01:33:31.906
SUPPLY IN THEIR DEMAND THEY HAVE

01:33:31.973 --> 01:33:33.574
AS PART OF THEIR RB GOALS.

01:33:33.641 --> 01:33:35.276
A GOAL OF MATCHING SUPPLY AND

01:33:35.343 --> 01:33:37.745
DEMAND YOU WILL PAY A LOT LESS

01:33:37.812 --> 01:33:39.647
FOR THAT PURPOSE STORAGE SO IT

01:33:39.714 --> 01:33:44.385
ENCOURAGES ELLIS CEASE. TO TO

01:33:44.452 --> 01:33:44.986
CREATE BELLS PORTFOLIOS THAT

01:33:45.052 --> 01:33:46.487
MATCH THEIR LOADS.

01:33:46.554 --> 01:33:48.255
LET ME JUST SAY HOMES THAT WERE

01:33:48.322 --> 01:33:51.058
ENCOURAGE BALANCING PORTFOLIOS

01:33:51.125 --> 01:33:52.626
THIS IS NEUTRAL.

01:33:52.693 --> 01:33:56.564
SHE GAVE A PARTICULAR EXAMPLE --

01:33:56.630 --> 01:33:58.532
IF THERE WERE ACCESS.

01:33:58.599 --> 01:34:00.735
STORAGE THE POINT IS YOU DON'T

01:34:00.801 --> 01:34:02.536
WANT TO GO TO THE SPOT MARKET

01:34:02.603 --> 01:34:03.604
YOU WANT TO HAVE LONG TERM

01:34:03.671 --> 01:34:05.573
CONTRACTS.

01:34:05.639 --> 01:34:07.475
WHICH ALLOW YOU WHEN.

01:34:07.541 --> 01:34:09.543
YOUR PARTICULAR RENEWABLES ARE

01:34:09.610 --> 01:34:11.579
NOT AVAILABLE TO GO.

01:34:11.645 --> 01:34:13.180
THAT ALLOW YOU TO GO TO

01:34:13.247 --> 01:34:14.548
ALTERNATIVE.

01:34:14.615 --> 01:34:16.317
I DON'T KNOW OR CARE WHAT THAT

01:34:16.384 --> 01:34:18.586
ALTERNATIVE IS BUT I THINK THAT

01:34:18.652 --> 01:34:19.754
SHOULD BE UNDER LONG TERM

01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:20.721
CONTRACT THOUGH THEY'LL BE

01:34:20.788 --> 01:34:23.057
OCCASIONS NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO

01:34:23.124 --> 01:34:24.125
WHEN YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO GO TO

01:34:24.191 --> 01:34:25.593
THE STEP SPOT MARKET.

01:34:25.659 --> 01:34:27.928
THE POINTED THIS BILL IS TO

01:34:27.995 --> 01:34:29.630
AVOID THOSE CHARGES WHICH

01:34:29.697 --> 01:34:31.465
CURRENTLY ARE JUST DISTRIBUTED

01:34:31.532 --> 01:34:33.434
ON THE BASIS OF LOAD WE WANT TO

01:34:33.501 --> 01:34:34.835
HAVE THEM DISTRIBUTED ON THE

01:34:34.902 --> 01:34:35.669
BASIS.

01:34:35.736 --> 01:34:39.006
OF OUR WHOEVER USE THE RESOURCE.

01:34:39.073 --> 01:34:40.975
AND SO IT FOR FOR THE OPPONENTS.

01:34:41.042 --> 01:34:42.943
YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE WORRIED

01:34:43.010 --> 01:34:45.012
ABOUT YOUR LOCKING IN. ONE VIEW

01:34:45.079 --> 01:34:47.581
OF THE GREAT BUT THEY'RE ARGUING

01:34:47.648 --> 01:34:49.784
THIS ACTUALLY STILL ALLOWS.

01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:51.685
FOR FLEXIBILITY SO.

01:34:51.752 --> 01:34:55.756
IS IS THE CONCERN ABOUT --

01:34:55.823 --> 01:34:56.624
AILING CURTAILMENT OR IS THAT

01:34:56.690 --> 01:34:58.626
WHAT WERE THAT SORT OF FUTURE OF

01:34:58.692 --> 01:35:00.127
OF A COST EFFECTIVE OVER

01:35:00.194 --> 01:35:01.862
JANUARY'S IT'S IS IT SOME OTHER

01:35:01.929 --> 01:35:04.799
ISSUE THAT SORT OF DRIVING THE

01:35:04.865 --> 01:35:08.903
THE CONCERN ABOUT THIS FRAMEWORK.

01:35:08.969 --> 01:35:10.671
DID I GET THAT DID I GET THAT

01:35:10.738 --> 01:35:13.607
WRONG I MEAN IT IT'S YEAH NO I I

01:35:13.674 --> 01:35:14.241
MEAN.

01:35:14.308 --> 01:35:15.342
PART OF PART OF WHAT WE NEED TO

01:35:15.409 --> 01:35:16.043
UNDERSTAND IS A PRETTY

01:35:16.110 --> 01:35:20.781
COMPLICATED ISSUE AND AND BY AT

01:35:20.848 --> 01:35:21.682
AN END AGAIN.

01:35:21.749 --> 01:35:23.884
KELLY HAS PROPOSED DOING THIS AT

01:35:23.951 --> 01:35:25.419
THE PC MULTIPLE TIMES THE PC HAS

01:35:25.486 --> 01:35:27.288
DECIDED IT'S NOT IN THE INTEREST

01:35:27.354 --> 01:35:28.823
OF THE PARTIES TO DO THIS.

01:35:28.889 --> 01:35:29.824
I MEAN IF WE STEP BACK AND LOOK

01:35:29.890 --> 01:35:30.825
AT THE FACT THAT THEY ARE A

01:35:30.891 --> 01:35:32.393
PROGRAM RIGHT NOW IS BEING IS

01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:33.994
BEING FAIRLY OVERHAULED THEY'RE

01:35:34.061 --> 01:35:36.764
pAPPROACH AND IT AND I THINK

01:35:36.831 --> 01:35:37.765
THERE'S A THERE'S A REASON FOR

01:35:37.832 --> 01:35:37.965
THAT.

01:35:38.032 --> 01:35:39.400
WHAT WHAT IS THAT?

01:35:39.467 --> 01:35:40.801
IN YOUR MIND BECAUSE I THINK

01:35:40.868 --> 01:35:42.169
THERE'S SO MUCH FLUIDITY THAT'S

01:35:42.236 --> 01:35:42.970
HAPPENING IN THE MARKET RIGHT

01:35:43.037 --> 01:35:44.872
NOW THAT THESE KINDS OF THINGS

01:35:44.939 --> 01:35:45.439
ARE GOING TO BE RESOLVED ON

01:35:45.506 --> 01:35:46.841
THEIR OWN.

01:35:46.907 --> 01:35:47.842
THIS IS A REALLY COMPLICATED I

01:35:47.908 --> 01:35:49.243
MEAN AGAIN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:50.478
FACT WE GOT FORTY ELLIS SEES

01:35:50.544 --> 01:35:51.712
THAT ARE IN THE MARKET WE'RE NOT

01:35:51.779 --> 01:35:53.514
GONNA HAVE ASK THE P. YOU SEE

01:35:53.581 --> 01:35:57.251
FORCED THE PC. TO BREAK DOWN

01:35:57.318 --> 01:35:58.385
EACH LSE'S.

01:35:58.452 --> 01:36:01.422
BASICALLY EACH LSE'S ANNUAL LOAD

01:36:01.489 --> 01:36:02.923
AND PORTFOLIO.

01:36:02.990 --> 01:36:04.291
ON AN ANNUAL BASIS WITHIN A

01:36:04.358 --> 01:36:05.826
THREE YEAR FORWARD FORWARD ARE A

01:36:05.893 --> 01:36:07.595
MARKET I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'RE

01:36:07.661 --> 01:36:09.029
GOING T DO THAT I DON'T KNOW IF

01:36:09.096 --> 01:36:09.697
THE PC KNOWS HOW THEY'RE GOING

01:36:09.763 --> 01:36:10.631
TO DO THAT.

01:36:10.698 --> 01:36:11.699
WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE PC

01:36:11.765 --> 01:36:13.601
HAS THIS AUTHORITY ALREADY THEY

01:36:13.667 --> 01:36:14.301
WOULD HAVE USED IT IF THEY

01:36:14.368 --> 01:36:15.536
THOUGHT THEY WANTED?

01:36:15.603 --> 01:36:17.738
TO AND THEY'RE ALREADY DIRECTING

01:36:17.805 --> 01:36:19.573
THE PARTIES RIGHT NOW AT LEAST

01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:22.309
BASED ON THE PROPOSED -- RULING

01:36:22.376 --> 01:36:23.844
THAT CAME OUT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.

01:36:23.911 --> 01:36:25.546
THERE DIRECTING THE ELLIS USED

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:27.681
TO PROCURE ARE A RESOURCES RIGHT

01:36:27.748 --> 01:36:27.882
NOW.

01:36:27.948 --> 01:36:29.750
AND SO THE PC'S ALREADY HANDLING

01:36:29.817 --> 01:36:31.352
THIS IT'S ALREADY ADDRESSING

01:36:31.418 --> 01:36:31.552
THIS.

01:36:31.619 --> 01:36:32.987
I'D RATHER NOT HAMSTRING THE P.

01:36:33.053 --> 01:36:34.355
YOU SEE WITH A SPECIFIC

01:36:34.421 --> 01:36:35.990
METHODOLOGY WRECKED OF TO DO A

01:36:36.056 --> 01:36:38.125
METHODOLOGY -- RIGHT WHEN IT'S

01:36:38.192 --> 01:36:39.393
BEGINNING TO GET SOME ESCAPE%

01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:41.228
VELOCITY ON THE IRP PROCESS AND

01:36:41.295 --> 01:36:42.730
THE ARE A PROCESS AND ESPECIALLY

01:36:42.796 --> 01:36:43.797
WHEN WE'RE LEARNING SO MUCH

01:36:43.864 --> 01:36:45.466
ABOUT THE GREAT CAPABILITIES OF

01:36:45.533 --> 01:36:46.433
SOLAR AND WIND AND STORAGE AND

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:47.568
EVERYTHING ELSE.

01:36:47.635 --> 01:36:48.669
IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT JUST TO

01:36:48.736 --> 01:36:50.271
MAKE SURE I KNOW WHAT I'M VOTING

01:36:50.337 --> 01:36:53.340
ON HERE THAT.

01:36:53.407 --> 01:36:54.241
IT'S IT'S SHALL DEVELOP

01:36:54.308 --> 01:36:54.708
[inaudible]

01:36:54.775 --> 01:36:56.510
SO THE IT WOULD THEY STILL HAVE

01:36:56.577 --> 01:36:58.445
THE DISCRETION TO NOT USE AYE I

01:36:58.512 --> 01:37:00.948
GET THE STAFF TIME CONCERN BUT

01:37:01.015 --> 01:37:02.616
CAN THEY STILL SAY NO TO THIS

01:37:02.683 --> 01:37:04.084
METHODOLOGY.

01:37:04.151 --> 01:37:05.719
IN IN YOUR MIND IS THAT THE

01:37:05.786 --> 01:37:07.221
INTENT TO MAKE THIS A DISORDER.

01:37:07.288 --> 01:37:08.689
A DISCRETIONARY METHODOLOGY

01:37:08.756 --> 01:37:10.658
COULD USE OR IS IT OR IS IT YOU

01:37:10.724 --> 01:37:12.326
WANT TO SEE IT LOOKS THIS WAY

01:37:12.393 --> 01:37:13.827
GOING FORWARD THAT SAID IS THAT

01:37:13.894 --> 01:37:14.862
WHAT'S GOING TO BE THIS BILL

01:37:14.929 --> 01:37:17.998
PROPOSES A PRINCIPLE. TO BE USED

01:37:18.065 --> 01:37:19.700
IN DEVELOPING A METHODOLOGY SO

01:37:19.767 --> 01:37:21.468
IT DOES NOT.

01:37:21.535 --> 01:37:22.236
PRESCRIBE A PARTICULAR

01:37:22.303 --> 01:37:23.904
METHODOLOGY IT SAYS.

01:37:23.971 --> 01:37:26.240
THE METHODOLOGY THAT YOU CHOOSE

01:37:26.307 --> 01:37:28.375
HAS TO BILL PEOPLE BASED ON HOW

01:37:28.442 --> 01:37:30.211
MUCH OF THE INTEGRATION RESOURCE

01:37:30.277 --> 01:37:32.546
THEY ARE USING IT HAS TO BE

01:37:32.613 --> 01:37:33.914
CAUSATION BASED.

01:37:33.981 --> 01:37:35.449
ALLOCATIONS WERE NOT GONNA

01:37:35.516 --> 01:37:36.917
SPREAD OUT BY LOW CHAIR WE'RE

01:37:36.984 --> 01:37:38.586
GONNA SPREAD IT BY HOW MUCH YOU

01:37:38.652 --> 01:37:40.154
ARE USING.

01:37:40.221 --> 01:37:42.423
THE SYSTEM INTEGRATION RESOURCES

01:37:42.489 --> 01:37:42.623
THAT.

01:37:42.690 --> 01:37:44.525
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO IT'S

01:37:44.592 --> 01:37:46.594
REALLY A VERY SIMPLE THING IS

01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:49.930
REALLY NOT A COMPLICATED THING.

01:37:49.997 --> 01:37:52.533
RIGHT NOW -- WIND BIOMASS

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.535
GEOTHERMAL WE DON'T WE DON'T WE

01:37:54.602 --> 01:37:55.803
DON'T GET ME CREDIT THAT WE'RE

01:37:55.869 --> 01:37:57.371
NOT CAUSING THE DUCK NECK

01:37:57.438 --> 01:38:00.641
PROBLEM -- THIS BILL WOULD

01:38:00.708 --> 01:38:02.476
FRANKLY GIVE US YOU KNOW A

01:38:02.543 --> 01:38:03.811
LITTLE BIT MORE OF A LEVEL

01:38:03.877 --> 01:38:06.947
PLAYING FIELD BY REQUIRING.

01:38:07.014 --> 01:38:08.482
THOSE WHO ARE PURCHASING SOLAR

01:38:08.549 --> 01:38:11.352
ALSO TO PAY FOR DUCK NECK COSTS

01:38:11.418 --> 01:38:12.086
UNDER STAND.

01:38:12.152 --> 01:38:13.053
I GUESS THOUGH THAT WAS MY POINT

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:14.555
TO YOUR INTENT IS FOR THIS TO BE

01:38:14.622 --> 01:38:16.257
ADOPTED AND UTILIZED YOU YOU

01:38:16.323 --> 01:38:17.324
WANT THAT IS.

01:38:17.391 --> 01:38:18.826
THE PRINCIPAL BUT IT'S NOT A

01:38:18.892 --> 01:38:20.427
PARTICULAR METHODOLOGY NEVER AYE

01:38:20.494 --> 01:38:21.729
SO DOES HAVE A PARTICULAR

01:38:21.795 --> 01:38:24.565
METHODOLOGY THAT IT NOW USES. TO

01:38:24.632 --> 01:38:27.401
ALLOCATE OF FLEXIBLE RAMPING

01:38:27.468 --> 01:38:29.637
COSTS AMONG LOCAL REGULATORY

01:38:29.703 --> 01:38:30.437
AUTHORITIES SO BETWEEN THE P.

01:38:30.504 --> 01:38:31.739
YOU SEE AND A PUBLICLY OWNED

01:38:31.805 --> 01:38:33.641
UTILITIES THIS WILL JUST TAKE

01:38:33.707 --> 01:38:35.142
THIS DOWN TO THE ELLIS THE

01:38:35.209 --> 01:38:37.478
LEVELS IT'S ALREADY BEING DONE I

01:38:37.544 --> 01:38:37.911
JUST WANTED TO ASK

01:38:37.978 --> 01:38:38.712
ASSEMBLYMEMBER.

01:38:38.779 --> 01:38:43.083
I MEAN ARE YOU OPEN AT ALL AND I

01:38:43.150 --> 01:38:43.550
DON'T.

01:38:43.617 --> 01:38:44.218
I'D BE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THE

01:38:44.285 --> 01:38:45.119
WITH THE SHALL CONSIDER KIND OF

01:38:45.185 --> 01:38:46.520
FRAMEWORK AS OPPOSED -- TO USE A

01:38:46.587 --> 01:38:48.522
METHODOLOGY BUT I THAT WOULD

01:38:48.589 --> 01:38:49.556
TAKE.

01:38:49.623 --> 01:38:53.460
A PRECEDING THAT WOULD IN FACT.

01:38:53.527 --> 01:38:54.928
OUR DISTRACT THE P. YOU SEE FROM

01:38:54.995 --> 01:38:56.530
WHAT IT HAS TO DO WITH THE POINT

01:38:56.597 --> 01:38:58.365
HERE IS INSTEAD OF DOING A TWO

01:38:58.432 --> 01:39:00.567
OR THREE OR FOUR YEAR PROCEEDING

01:39:00.634 --> 01:39:01.702
TO DETERMINE.

01:39:01.769 --> 01:39:03.470
WHETHER OR NOT YOU WOULD USE

01:39:03.537 --> 01:39:06.540
THIS METHODOLOGY -- WE WOULD

01:39:06.607 --> 01:39:09.109
CALLUM USES METHODOLOGY NOW THEY

01:39:09.176 --> 01:39:10.344
ALREADY WILL HAVE ALL THE

01:39:10.411 --> 01:39:12.079
INFORMATION THEY NEED BECAUSE

01:39:12.146 --> 01:39:14.782
THE I SO TELLS THEM EXACTLY.

01:39:14.848 --> 01:39:16.684
WHAT COSTS WERE INCURRED BY BOTH

01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:18.952
AND IT BY AT ALL THE ENTITIES?

01:39:19.019 --> 01:39:21.322
THE OTHER THING IS IT MAY BE

01:39:21.388 --> 01:39:23.490
THAT WIND OR FEW THERMAL OR

01:39:23.557 --> 01:39:25.793
WHATEVER LIKES THIS BILL.

01:39:25.859 --> 01:39:27.428
I DON'T REALLY CARE WHETHER THEY

01:39:27.494 --> 01:39:28.629
LIKE IT OR NOT NICE TO BE MY

01:39:28.696 --> 01:39:31.265
SPONSOR BUT I DON'T CARE.

01:39:31.332 --> 01:39:32.966
ABOUT WHAT I CARE ABOUT IS THAT

01:39:33.033 --> 01:39:36.103
BECAUSE THE MARKET SIGNALS WORK

01:39:36.170 --> 01:39:37.604
AND THAT WE MAKE THE P. UC'S

01:39:37.671 --> 01:39:39.373
WORK EASIER WHICH IS WHAT THIS

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:40.441
WOULD DO.

01:39:40.507 --> 01:39:41.675
THEY WON'T HAVE TO DO A LONG

01:39:41.742 --> 01:39:44.044
PROCEEDING LET ME ALSO READ FOR

01:39:44.111 --> 01:39:50.784
A QUOTE FROM THIS -- THE P. UC --

01:39:50.851 --> 01:39:53.053
HAS REJECTED PARTY'S ARGUMENTS

01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:55.422
THAT THE COPY SO CAUSATION

01:39:55.489 --> 01:39:56.690
METHODOLOGY IS COUNTER TO

01:39:56.757 --> 01:39:59.193
CALIFORNIA'S GOLD RENEWABLES.

01:39:59.259 --> 01:40:00.928
THE P. YOU SEE HAS STATED WE

01:40:00.994 --> 01:40:02.563
BELIEVE THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE IN

01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:04.031
PARTICULAR WE NOTE.

01:40:04.098 --> 01:40:05.532
THAT SEVERAL OF THE BENEFITS

01:40:05.599 --> 01:40:07.368
DESCRIBED BY THE LEGISLATURE AS

01:40:07.434 --> 01:40:09.470
JUSTIFICATION FOR THE R. P. AS

01:40:09.536 --> 01:40:09.737
PROGRAM.

01:40:09.803 --> 01:40:12.172
OUR BEST SUPPORTED BY INCENTIVES

01:40:12.239 --> 01:40:13.807
TO MINIMIZE RENEWABLE

01:40:13.874 --> 01:40:16.744
INTEGRATION COSTS SUCH AS

01:40:16.810 --> 01:40:18.245
ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY.

01:40:18.312 --> 01:40:21.648
pSAYING IS DON'T GO TO THE SPOT

01:40:21.715 --> 01:40:23.717
MARKET UNLESS YOU HAVE TO WHICH

01:40:23.784 --> 01:40:25.352
WILL HAPPEN FROM TIME TO TIME.

01:40:25.419 --> 01:40:26.820
BUT MINIMIZE THE NUMBER OF TIMES

01:40:26.887 --> 01:40:29.423
YOU HAVE TO GO BECAUSE IF YOU

01:40:29.490 --> 01:40:31.392
HAVE LONG TERM CONTRACTS WHICH

01:40:31.458 --> 01:40:33.026
IS SURE THAT RELIABILITY.

01:40:33.093 --> 01:40:33.961
YOU'RE GOING TO BE MUCH BETTER

01:40:34.027 --> 01:40:36.430
OFF COST TWICE AND AGAIN I AM

01:40:36.497 --> 01:40:39.199
COMPLETELY TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL.

01:40:39.266 --> 01:40:39.967
THANK YOU FOR THE INTELLIGENCE

01:40:40.033 --> 01:40:42.136
BUDGET A RESPONSE THERE IT JUST

YOU DO NOT WANT TO SEE THIS KIND

01:40:44.071 --> 01:40:45.572
OF METHODOLOGY ADOPT ISN'T WHAT

01:40:45.639 --> 01:40:46.974
WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE THAT YOU

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:49.176
ALL WANT TO SEE IN AN LSA OR

01:40:49.243 --> 01:40:50.244
THAT FUTURE.

01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:51.712
YOU LIKE WHAT YOU LIKE BUSINESS

01:40:51.779 --> 01:40:53.247
AS USUAL RIGHT NOW IS THAT IS

01:40:53.313 --> 01:40:54.615
THAT THE POOR I MEAN THAT THE

01:40:54.681 --> 01:40:56.216
CURRENT ALLOCATION FORM THAT

01:40:56.283 --> 01:40:57.384
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THAT

01:40:57.451 --> 01:41:00.721
SEEM MORE EQUITABLE OR JUST A

FLUX RIGHT NOW BEEN RIGHT NOW

01:41:07.294 --> 01:41:09.496
BUSINESS AS USUAL IS CHANGING

01:41:09.563 --> 01:41:10.731
AND SO WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT

01:41:10.798 --> 01:41:11.865
THE NEW ARE RE RULES ARE GOING

01:41:11.932 --> 01:41:13.467
TO BE WE DON'T KNOW.

01:41:13.534 --> 01:41:14.768
WHAT THE WHAT THE RESPONSE FROM

01:41:14.835 --> 01:41:16.069
THE PARTIES WILL BE FROM THE P.

01:41:16.136 --> 01:41:18.005
UC'S LATEST DIRECTIVE THAT AGAIN

01:41:18.071 --> 01:41:19.406
WAS JUST TWO WEEKS AGO TO DIRECT

01:41:19.473 --> 01:41:22.976
THE LSE'S TO GO PROCURE ARE A --

01:41:23.043 --> 01:41:24.878
IN OUR SINCE THIS IS.

01:41:24.945 --> 01:41:27.181
THIS IS BOTH PREMATURE AND ITS

01:41:27.247 --> 01:41:29.550
PREJUDICES AGAINST SOLAR AND

01:41:29.616 --> 01:41:30.818
NANCY WAS TALKING A LITTLE BIT

01:41:30.884 --> 01:41:32.186
ABOUT THAT AND THAT IT IT GIVES

01:41:32.252 --> 01:41:33.620
A LEGUP TO WIND BIOMASS

01:41:33.687 --> 01:41:34.922
GEOTHERMAL.

01:41:34.988 --> 01:41:37.324
MY POINT IS BASED ON THE NEED TO

01:41:37.391 --> 01:41:39.259
DE CARBONIZED ARE GRADED IN THE

01:41:39.326 --> 01:41:40.527
TIME PERIOD WE HAVE WHAT WE NEED

01:41:40.594 --> 01:41:42.062
TO BUY ALL THE GEOTHERMAL ALL

01:41:42.129 --> 01:41:43.630
THE WIND ALL THE BIO MASS THAT

01:41:43.697 --> 01:41:45.599
WE CAN GET OUR HANDS ON AND WE

01:41:45.666 --> 01:41:45.799
WILL.

01:41:45.866 --> 01:41:47.201
IN ADDITION TO THAT WE'RE GOING

01:41:47.267 --> 01:41:48.969
TO BUY A WHOLE BUNCH OF SOLAR.

01:41:49.036 --> 01:41:51.171
SO WE NEED TO MOVE OUT OF OUR

01:41:51.238 --> 01:41:52.806
PAST RUBRIC OF OF SCARCITY

01:41:52.873 --> 01:41:54.808
THINKING AND SEILING OUR

01:41:54.875 --> 01:41:56.443
PROCUREMENT UNDERSTAND THAT WE

01:41:56.510 --> 01:41:57.411
GOT A BY ALL OF IT WE'RE GONNA

01:41:57.478 --> 01:41:58.579
MEET OUR CLIMATE TOWARD ITS AND

01:41:58.645 --> 01:41:59.713
WE NEED NOT PREJUDICED AGAINST

01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:02.382
ANYTHING.

01:42:02.449 --> 01:42:02.883
WE NEED TO START WORKING

01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:04.651
TOGETHER.

01:42:04.718 --> 01:42:06.987
AND I WOULD ACTUALLY AGREE THAT.

01:42:07.054 --> 01:42:08.722
THAT'S THE CASE AND THAT THIS

01:42:08.789 --> 01:42:10.190
BILL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT

01:42:10.257 --> 01:42:11.658
IT'S SIMPLY GIVING A MARKET

01:42:11.725 --> 01:42:13.594
SIGNAL.

01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:16.296
AND I'M HAPPY A FEW.

01:42:16.363 --> 01:42:17.731
THE TO HAVE ALL THE SO IF YOU

01:42:17.798 --> 01:42:19.299
COULD CURE ALL THE SOLO YOU WANT

01:42:19.366 --> 01:42:20.734

MEASURE HERE.

01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:27.307
THIS IS COMPLICATED AND

01:42:27.374 --> 01:42:28.742
CONVOLUTED BECAUSE WE'VE HAD

01:42:28.809 --> 01:42:29.910
LEGISLATORS FOR THE LAST TWENTY

01:42:29.977 --> 01:42:31.678
YEARS.

01:42:31.745 --> 01:42:33.580
RIGHT ENERGY POLICY AND THEY

01:42:33.647 --> 01:42:35.182
KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ENERGY AND

01:42:35.249 --> 01:42:36.683
THAT'S WHY WE ARE DEALING WITH

01:42:36.750 --> 01:42:39.319
THIS HODGE PODGE OF WHAT WE CALL.

01:42:39.386 --> 01:42:41.722
ENERGY RELIABILITY THE NUMBER

01:42:41.788 --> 01:42:43.223
ONE ISSUE FOR THE P. YOU SEE IS

01:42:43.290 --> 01:42:45.859
NOT PRICE IS NOT NOT TECHNOLOGY

01:42:45.926 --> 01:42:47.694
ITS RELIABILITY AND THIS IS WHAT

01:42:47.761 --> 01:42:49.596
THIS BILL IS IT'S A RELIABILITY

01:42:49.663 --> 01:42:52.533
ISSUE WE WERE ANY ENERGY CRISIS

01:42:52.599 --> 01:42:53.667
IN.

01:42:53.734 --> 01:42:54.268
TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE

01:42:54.334 --> 01:42:55.068
BECAUSE OF THE SPOT MARKET

01:42:55.135 --> 01:42:56.870
BECAUSE OF NOT HAVING --

01:42:56.937 --> 01:42:58.405
ADEQUATE RESOURCE IN HAND TO BUY

01:42:58.472 --> 01:42:59.773
IT ON THE SPOT MARKET WE WILL

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:01.942
NEVER EXIST AS A STATE WILL

01:43:02.009 --> 01:43:03.744
NEVER BE THEN -- Là A FOURTH

01:43:03.810 --> 01:43:05.546
LEADING ECONOMY IN THE WORLD IF

01:43:05.612 --> 01:43:09.816
WE THINK WE SAIL MORE SOLAR.

01:43:09.883 --> 01:43:10.851
WE PAY I SHOULD SAY.

01:43:10.918 --> 01:43:12.953
A LITTLE NEVADA THE TAKE MORE

01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:14.555
SOLAR THEN WE USE IN CALIFORNIA

01:43:14.621 --> 01:43:19.126
ON A DAILY BASIS AND WE CONTINUE

01:43:19.192 --> 01:43:19.693
TO TALK ABOUT BUILDING MORE

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.628
SOLAR BUT DOCTOR QUIRK WILL KNOW

01:43:21.695 --> 01:43:22.496
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE SOLAR

01:43:22.563 --> 01:43:23.864
ELECTRON CAN MOVE.

01:43:23.931 --> 01:43:25.532
WITHOUT TRADITIONAL GENERATION

01:43:25.599 --> 01:43:26.900
YOU NEED TURBINE YOU NEED TO

01:43:26.967 --> 01:43:28.669
NURTURE SO TO CONTINUE TO SAY

01:43:28.735 --> 01:43:30.304
WE'RE GOING TO DO AWAY WITH BASS

01:43:30.370 --> 01:43:31.738
LOW POWER.

01:43:31.805 --> 01:43:33.273
WILL THEN WE WILL BE.

01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:35.075
IN A WORLD OF TROUBLE I AS FAR

01:43:35.142 --> 01:43:36.610
SYSTEM RELIABILITY THIS IS THE

01:43:36.677 --> 01:43:39.279
SYSTEM RELIABILITY BUT BILL IT'S

01:43:39.346 --> 01:43:40.647
COMMON SENSE IF WE WANT TO MAKE

SURE THE LIGHTS STAY ON AND SO I

01:43:42.849 --> 01:43:46.386
MOVED THE MEASURE.

IF PEOPLE WANT TO BUY A LOT OF

01:43:56.630 --> 01:43:58.398
SOLAR AND LOT OF STORAGE THAT'S

01:43:58.465 --> 01:44:00.200
JUST FINE WITH ME.

01:44:00.267 --> 01:44:01.602
