THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOW GOING TO ALLOW FOR RECIPIENTS OF OUR EBT SYSTEM MARK HELFRICH SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO USE THEIR BENEFITS FOR ORDERING FOOD OR ONLINE. AND AS WE KNOW IN OUR NORMAL STORE IF YOU'RE THERE YOU CAN SEE THE FOOD YOU KNOW THAT IT'S YEAH YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT CAN A ROTTEN OR WHATEVER. AND WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO IS CREATE SOME CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR ART EBT RECIPIENTS SO THAT WHEN THEY ORDER FOOD ONLINE THEY ARE PROTECTED AND IT A PROVIDE IT ALLOWS FOR SAFE AN ETHICAL STANDARDS FOR ONLINE PURCHASING. AND IT ESTABLISHES A WORKING GROUP COMPOSED MAJOR STAKE HOLDERS INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN PLACE WHEN A CALPERS RECIPIENT USES THEIR CALPERS BENEFITS TO ORDER ONLINE FOOD. AND WITH THAT I LET MY WITNESSES TO PRESENT. KEVIN AS THE COALITION CALIFORNIA WHAT FOR ITS ORGANIZATION FOR THE WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU- WITH- WITH SUPPORTERS BUILT- THIS BILL WILL AFFECT TWO POINT TWO MILLION HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA. THE AVERAGE BENEFITS THE PAY OF A PERSON GETS A HUNDRED TWENTY SIX DOLLARS AND WITH GOING ONLINE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE COULD DEVELOP PROCESSES COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT. AND OF STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROCESSES THANKS THE BENEFITS WITH SPECIALLY IN CLIENTS LIVING IN RURAL REYES WHO DO WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO GO DOWN TO THE STORE AND GET GOOD STUFF THIS WITH A COULD GIVE. THE THIRD FOOD AND THREE THE CHILDREN DISCIPLINE WILL DRIVE VOTE THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY MEMBERS OF PUBLIC THAT WISH TO US STATE THEIR PUBLIC SUPPORT.

ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS SENATOR PAN THANK YOU- IS THERE SKINNER FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD CERTAINLY WE DO WANT TO TRY TO SALVAGE THE STANDARDS BEFORE ANY I KNOW THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOT QUITE THERE YET- EVEN THOUGH- THE WINDING AND BEETHOVEN AND ALICE'S WAS THE MENTION THAT- PERHAPS THE OFFICE OF SYSTEMS INTEGRATION THE FARM HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SHOULD ALSO BE PART OF THE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS SINCE THEY ARE THE PRIDE THE IMPLEMENTERS AS THE IT DEPARTMENT FOR THE JET AGE SO IS THAT YOUR AND DO YOU PLAN TO DO THAT- IT'S NOT CLEAR FIGHT BECAUSE THAT WAS A COMMENT IN THE- IN THE ANALYSIS RIGHT. NOW IT'S TIME IT IS DSS THAT WOULD- FIGURE OUT WHO THE STATE CALLED WERE WE CERTAINLY CAN RECOMMEND TO THEM AND OF COURSE PART OF OUR ISSUE IS NOT SO MUCH. AND I KNOW THAT THIS ISN'T WHERE YOU'RE GOING BUT NOT SO MUCH- IMPROVING THE RECIPIENTS YOU KNOW ONLINE CAPABILITIES BUT MORE THAT. AND AGAIN WERE YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO ASSUME AT ALL THAT ANY BUSINESS THAT YOU'RE YOU YOU KNOW ORDERING ONLINE IS IN ANY WAY- TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU BUT LET'S SAY THEY SEND YOU. NOT WHEN YOUR. OR WHAT'S OUT OF DATE OR WHATEVER NOW YOU'VE GIVEN OF YOU'VE GIVEN THEM EBT BENEFIT NOT AT. ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO RECOVER THAT ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE TO- YOU KNOW THAT IT'S THAT SORT OF THING THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE EBT RECIPIENT HAS THE SAME TYPE OF CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT YOU AND I HAVE. YEAH. SHE DID ANSWER I KNOW YOU'LL BE WORKING ON THIS BILL AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO THAT AT THIS TIME. OKAY OKAY. WELL. WHEN THE STUDY THIS IF THEY COULD STUDY THINGS LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE GET THEIR DIET DIET FOOD. IN DELIVER TO THROUGH THIS MEANS I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS APPLICABLE TO THAT AND THEN. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE. AS YOU KNOW PROBABLY THERE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT. LIKE THE HOME DELIVERY THE FOOD YOU KNOW LIKE. NEWS OF WILK YEAH YEAH BUT OTHERS I RESTAURANTS RIGHT BUT BUT PROFIT MAKING COMPANY YES DO IT YOU KNOW YES THEY DID. DELIVER FRESH GROCERIES. THAT KIND OF STUFF TO PEOPLE'S HOUSES YEAH I ALWAYS KIND OF WONDER. HOW MUCH IS REALLY OF THE REGULAR CHARGE HOW MUCH IS THERE SOME KIND OF HIDDEN BUILT IN RIGHT SERVICE CHARGE OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW. AND WHAT'S THE RULE ON EASY TO USE FOR LIKE SERVICE CHARGES FOR DELIVERIES IS THERE. IS THERE A STANDARD YES HELLO. EXACTLY KNOW THAT KIND OF THING AND FOR THE FOR THE- I KNOW THE ONES THAT ARE DELIVERED FOR THE. DIET THE CHARGE THE CHARGE SERVICE FEES SOMETIMES YOU KNOW FOR PEOPLE. AND IS SPECIALLY IF THEY START BEING REAL SPECIFIC ABOUT THEIR DIET YOU GENERALLY WANT LIKE. SO THEY WANT VEGAN OR YOU KNOW. KOSHER WHATEVER BUT ALSO DIET IN A LIKE BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS WE WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT DSS WOULD- THINK ABOUT IS LIKE ALL RIGHT IS THE EBT CARD OR THE EBT BENEFIT THAT WHICH IS GOING TO PAY FOR THE DELIVERY OR NOT IF THERE'S A DELIVERY CHARGE. AND RIGHT AND ALSO WE'VE NOW ALLOWED FOR. A LIMITED AMOUNT OF VB T. FOR A RESTAURANT MEAL SO WITH THAT COVER SAY THE DOOR DASH DELIVERY THAT THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS OKAY. YEAH. AND CENTER JACK'S PLACE. OF QUESTIONS I NOTED THAT THIS BILL- HEADED PRIOR ITERATION IS SB SIX SEVENTY FIVE WHAT HI THIS IS BILL THEIR FEAR FROM RIGHT SO IN SIX SEVENTY FIVE WE WERE ALREADY TRYING TO BE. DESCRIPTIVE BUT PREDICT TO WHAT TYPE OF CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THE- BENEFICIARY SHOULD HAVE A OF IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE VENDOR WHO MIGHT BE. PROVIDING THEM EITHER THE MEAL FOR THE FOOD USING THE EBT BENEFITS RIGHT SO WE WERE BEING SPECIFIC AND THAT WAS IN IN JUST MOVING IT THROUGH THE PROCESS NUMBER ONE WE ALWAYS RUN INTO A COST PROBLEM WHEN WE'RE BEING THAT SPECIFIC AND NUMBER TWO IT WAS SETTING OF THE AGENCY NOT REALLY. WHILE WHILE I WILL SAY I THINK THAT MUCH OF WHAT WE IDENTIFIED IS PROBABLY SPOT ON IT IS BETTER TO HAVE THE STAKEHOLDERS DEVELOP THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO NO THEN THE DESIGN IT SO THAT IT'S MOST EASILY IMPLEMENTABLE AND SO THAT'S WHY WE WENT BACK. WE. IN EFFECT REVAMPED AND DECIDED ALL RIGHT INSTEAD WE WILL DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT TO SET UP A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO COME UP WITH THOSE THINGS. AND THE OTHER QUESTION IS- THIS SEEMS LIKE AN IDEAL PROGRAM FOR SENIORS AND PEOPLE WHO OTHERWISE MORE HOUSEBOUND. THAN OTHERS IS THERE GOING TO BE ANY SUGGESTION TO. THAT FOCUS ON THIS NOT NECESSARILY PRIMARILY BUT AT LEAST AS PART OF THE WHOLE DISCUSSION HOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT. IN YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT ACTUALLY HAVE ACCESS TO ON LINE OPPORTUNITIES. OR MAY BUT CANNOT CANNOT LEAVE THEIR HOMES AND SO FORTH OF MIGHT BE ABLE TO ENSURE ACCESS TO THIS KIND OF A PROGRAM NO IT'S INTERESTING CONCEPT IS CERTAINLY MORE AND MORE ARE SENIORS ARE EVEY T. RECIPIENTS. YEAH I CHOSE THE ABSCESS YOU MOVE THE BILL FORWARD YOU COULD MAKE SOME REFERENCE TO HAS YES KNOWLEDGE THAT ADDITIONAL NEED THANK YOU GOOD. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE- WITH THAT BY S. ZERO VOTE. SO WE HAVE A MOTION- BY SENATOR PAN AND THAT MOTION IS TO PASS THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

FEEL FREE TO START WHENEVER YOU OKAY THANK YOU ENSURING GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS. FIRST I JUST WANT TO START OFF BANKING COMMITTEE FOR THEIR VERY THOROUGH AND USEFUL ANALYSIS- AND HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED- THE BILL EMANATES FROM THE CRISES WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH. WHO REALLY POINTEDLY- THIS FALL BUT BEEN REALLY THROUGHOUT THE LAST YEAR YEAR AND A HALF AS UTILITY STARTED USING PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF IS ONE WAY THAT THEY ARE GOING TO CHOOSE TO MITIGATE FIRE RISK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND- WITH ALL CRIME EMERGENCIES WE KNOW THAT THE- THE- MOST LOW INCOME MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE GET HIT FIRST AND SO IN THIS CASE WE FOUND A NEW. VICTIM OF THIS CRISIS AND THAT- LOT IHS RECIPIENTS AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WERE ALSO ALIGNING WITH THOSE IN THEIR POWER SHUT OFF AND THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT EVEN BE AWARE THAT THERE ARE UTILITY PROGRAMS OUT THERE TO SIGN UP FOR WHAT THEY CALL MEDICAL BASELINE RATE- THAT INSURE CERTAIN PROTECTIONS. CONTINUITY OF CARE WITH YOUR ELECTRICITY SAY FOR KEEPING YOUR MEDICINE REFRIGERATED YOUR RESPIRATOR ON- AND SO WITH THIS BILL IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE I DON'T THINK GOING TO SOLVE THE ENTIRE PROBLEM. BUT AT AT THE VERY LEAST- START TO UTILIZE THE HSS NETWORK TO LET THE CUSTOMERS KNOW WHAT WHAT RESOURCES THEY HAVE AVAILABLE ON THE UTILITY SIDE- AND I THINK THE LAST PIECE I WOULD JUST A HEARING. THE WORKERS WHO DO THIS WORK THE IHS AS WORKERS OUR FRIENDS TO DO W. ME. UP THOSE FOLKS A BEARD. GOING THROUGH THE P. S. P. S. CYCLE LAST TIME AND STRETCHED AND WORKED OVERTIME AND SORT OF WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND. SO PLEASE KEEP IN MIND AS WE GO FORWARD YOU KNOW. NEED TO HELP MINISTER EFFECTIVELY OUR SERVICES SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHO CAN GET A POWER PACKER GENERATOR OUT TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER OR SOMEONE ELSE WAS HOME. ON A HOME SUPPORT SERVICES. WE'RE STARTING A PUZZLE ON WHETHER. THE HEALTH SIDE IS AT A BETTER ACCESS POINT AND SAY. RUNNING SOME OTHER PC PROGRAM BUT FOR RIGHT NOW THE BILL'S PRETTY LIMITED IN SCOPE- AND IT'S JUST SAYING COUNTIES- NEED TO FIND SOME WAY TO INFORM MY TO ASSIST CUSTOMERS THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS MEDICAL BASELINE. PROGRAM SORRY FOR THE LONG WINDED INTRODUCTION- WE DO HAVE WITH US TODAY BEVERLY YOU WITH A U. D. W.

AND THEY ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO BE INJURED OR DIE IN THE EVENT OF A POWER SHUT OFF FOR WILDFIRE. WELL THE STATE CONTINUES TO EXPLORE LONG TERM SOLUTIONS IT IS CRITICAL THEIR PROVIDERS AND CLIENTS KNOW. ABOUT THE MEDICAL BASELINE PROGRAMS AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR CLIENTS WHO RELY ON LIFE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT HAVE LIFE THREATENING ILLNESSES. OR COMPROMISED IMMUNE SYSTEMS. THE MEDICAL BASS FINALIST CAN SAVE LIVES AS PART OUR- I DON'T. CUSTOMERS A NEED I A VANCE NOTIFICATION. LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND STAFF FOR BRING THIS BILL FORWARD SB SIX TO PROTECT OUR MEMBERS AND CLIENTS DURING THESE LIFE THREATENING. EVENTS SO THEY CAN BETTER PLAN FOR EMERGENCIES. DR VOTE THANK YOU. THE CHECKER CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA- AS WE CERTAINLY FOUND OVER THE COURSE OF THIS LAST FALL THE- POWER SHUT OFFS- ENDED UP HAVING JUST THE THREAT TO THESE POWER SHOPS HAVING DRAMATIC EFFECTS ON PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES- BOTH THE AREAS AND MUCH MORE- BROADLY- WE APPRECIATE CENTER STERN'S EFFORT ON ON THIS BILL IMPORTANTLY BE THERE BECOMES THIS VIEW THAT WE'VE GOT THE MEDICAL BASELINE PROGRAM AND THAT IS A- SUFFICIENT- PROGRAM TO PROVIDE NOTICE IT FALLS WELL SHORT OF THE- RELATIONS THAT WE KNOW WE NEED. TO BUT IS TO IN THE BAND. VERY SHORT NOTICE OF POWER UPS. EFFORT THAT WE CAN TAKE REACH OTHER POPULATIONS THAT WE KNOW BOTH TO GET THEM WITH THE DIRECT NOTICE BUT TO GET THEM ALL ON TO- THE MEDICAL BASS LINE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE NOTIFICATIONS THERE- ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. AND DOES SO WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THIS- THIS EFFORT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH SENATOR STERN AS WELL. I KNOW WHAT OTHER- NOTIFICATIONS THROUGHOUT THE BENEFIT PROGRAMS- THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT THE POPULATIONS ARE GOING TO GET- THE NOTIFICATION THIS IS ONLY ONE SMALL PIECE OF A YOU ARE BETTER THAN I. AM A MUCH BROADER PROBLEM WITH THE IMPACTING. OF THE GLOBAL POPULATIONS- SO WE APPRECIATE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY MEMBERS OF PUBLIC AND SUPPORT PLEASE COME UP STATE YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION. JOHN KENNEDY WITH WORLD COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA IN STRONG SUPPORT WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT MEDICALLY SENSITIVE POPULATIONS AND- AND THE IMPACT OF PS PS OF AND ON THOSE POPULATIONS. IN UNDER GRAD PROGRAM IN THIS REALLY HELPS US GET THE NOTIFICATION AND NEGATION OF IMPACT TO THOSE ASM POPULATION SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET ME SAY THIS ON BEHALF OF KAPPA FOR HSS AND AT THE A YOU CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT. DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. THREE NINE OKAY ADDITIONALLY ARE THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE BILL IMPRINT- WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. AND SO SHOULD THE BILL MOVE FORWARD. YOU DON'T. JUST ASK IN DARK THE AUTHOR MIGHT CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING WHAT DOES INFORMING IN THE CONTEXT OF THE BILL- WELL THE COUNTIES BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PRIVATE PROVIDING FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROGRAM. OF ALL THE TAKE UP WILL BE HAVE TO MAKE A REFERRAL. OUT WILL VERBAL NOTICE SUFFICE A WHAT ENTITIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP INFORMATION REGARDING MEDICAL BASELINE. WILL IT BE THE COUNTY IS THE UTILITIES OR SOME OTHER ENTITY- IS INITIAL APPLICATION THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO NOTIFY INDIVIDUALS. OF MEDICAL BASS LINE OR WOULD IT BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO NOTIFY RECIPIENTS AT THE TIME OF APPLICATION AND REASSESSMENT. ODD THE OTHER BY REACHING THE FULL POPULATION OF AYE HSS RECIPIENTS. I WITH THE ANALYSIS WAS SPOT ON IN IN SORT OF IDENTIFYING HOW TO MAKE THE MECHANICS WORK AND WE'RE VERY OPENED ITS STAYING CLOSE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND LET YOU GUYS. HELP US SHAPE. OF A EFFICIENT. SORT INTERVENTION PROCESS WHERE WE'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EXISTING DOLLARS IN EXISTING PROGRAMS RIGHT WHAT IF UTILITIES ALREADY HAVE OUT THERE AND HOW NOT TO SORT OF OVER BURDENS SAY THE COUNTIES OR ANYONE ENTITY SO A VERY OPEN TO. THINKING THROUGH MECHANICS AND- MAKING SURE THE PROCESS OF INFORMING. IS GOING TO BE TAILORED IN A WAY THAT REALLY HELPS THIS POPULATION I MEAN RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT. OVER I THINK IT'S OVER FIVE AND FORTY THOUSAND I JUSTICE CLIENTS IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA AND- TOTAL THERE'S ONLY THREE TO FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE SIGNED UP FOR MEDICAL BASELINE STATEWIDE. SO WE ACTUALLY THINK THE POPULATION OF OLDER PEOPLE IS BROADER THAN I HSS EVEN I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THE WHOLE AXIS OF FUNCTIONAL NEEDS COMMUNITY LIKE THAT'S PROBABLY A BIGGER NUMBER WE WANT TO START HERE AND AT LEAST GET THE CONVERSATION GOING BUT- MADAM CHAIR I. I THINK- YOUR EXPERTISE IN THIS HEARING COMMITTEE DIGGING IN HELPING US FLETCHER THAT WOULD BE. VERY WELCOME SO- YEAH THANK YOU YEAH THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE PROCESS WILL START CENTER JACKSON AND THEN CENTER PAN YEAH THE THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU FOR THOSE QUESTIONS I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT- OBVIOUSLY THIS BILL. NEEDS A LOT. OF WORK IT'S SORT OF GOTTEN AMENDED APPROACHES. AN OBVIOUS PROBLEM BUT WE- OF AS AS WE TRY TO DEAL WITH- A EXPANDING THIS AS YOU JUST MENTIONED TO ACCESS AND THE ACCESS OF. FUNCTIONAL NEEDS COMMUNITY- A I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. WE NOT CREATE SO MANY LAYERS OF. IRAQ CHRISSY THAT IS SOME LAYERS INCLUDES SOME GROUP IN SOME INCLUDE ANOTHER AND WE'VE GOT LEGISLATION I KNOW THAT YOU AND I ARE BOTH DOING THE TO MAKE SURE ON EMERGENCY ALERTS THESE PEOPLE ARE. EARLY IN THE IN THE QUEUE SO THAT THINGS CAN BE DONE TO HELP THEM EXPEDITE THEIR THE ASSISTANCE FOR THEM I JUST CAUTION AND JUST URGE THAT. AS THIS BILL EVOLVES THAT WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT YOU DON'T WANT IT'S TO BE SO. SPECIFIC DAD IT INCLUDES- DOESN'T INCLUDE SO THAT IF IT IS IN FACT THE COUNTIES THAT WE REQUIRED TO DO THIS VERSES THE UTILITIES OR WHOEVER IT IS THAT ALSO. GOING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR AN EFFECTIVE PROGRAM ISN'T JUST ONE OF SEVERAL SO THAT WHEN WE- WHEN WE DO OUR- SORT OF THE- MAP OUT THE- THE CHANGE RESPONSIBILITIES IT LOOKS LIKE A- YOU KNOW AN ALGORITHM ITSELF. IT'S GOT TO BE I WOULD SUGGEST PART OF A BROADER BUT MORE COMPREHENSIVE- PROGRAM TO ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THESE FOLKS WHETHER IT BE A PSP A SITUATION OR AN EMERGENCY SITUATION OR GAINING ACCESS TO THIS- REDUCE ELECTRICITY RATES THESE ARE. THESE ARE FOLKS AND WITHIN THAT. THAT STE THAT GROUP THE SUBSETS. OF INDIVIDUALS WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING ALL OF THESE ISSUES- COLLECTIVELY RATHER THAN SAYING WELL WE'VE GOT THIS GROUP OVER HERE AND THEN COUNTY WILL HAVE TO DO THIS FOR THIS GROUP. HERE SO THAT WE END UP WITH SUCH A QUAGMIRE. WHICH IS TO AND DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RESPONSIBILITIES ARE SO I THINK IF WE INCLUDE THESE ALL AS PART OF A VERY NECESSARY GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH FUNCTIONAL NEEDS- I HSS WORK. OF THE PEOPLE OF RECEIVING THIS THIS ASSISTANCE IT'S ALL PART OF A- OF A BIGGER WHOLE THAT WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING SO THAT WE DON'T JUST KEEP CARVING IT UP AND CONFUSING THE HECK OUT OF OUR BUREAUCRATS IN OUR COUNTY PEOPLE AS WELL. AND IF I MAY THERE'S THIS THING IS TMI RIGHT THERE'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE GETTING. YOU KNOW GETTING UP. SOMETHING FROM ONE AGENCY IN SOMETHING ELSE FROM ANOTHER ANY SCENES I MEAN WE'VE DEALT WITH THE LACK OF UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS AROUND CRISES. SO I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THE GOAL OF THE BILL SHOULD BE. AN INTEGRATED AND SORT OF STREAMLINED APPROACH THAT'S. CALLIE CHURCHES FOR INSTANCE HAD A HOTLINE THEY WERE THE ONLY ONES SECRETARY GOLLY STEPPED UP AND PUT A HOTLINE TOGETHER SO PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE SOMEONE TO CALL IF THERE COUNTY TWO ONE ONE DIDN'T WORK TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT. CAN I GET A GENERATOR WHERE DO I GO- GOD BLESS HIM FOR I MEAN &lt;c.cyan&gt;y THEY&lt;/c&gt; GOT THAT STOOD UP QUICKLY. BUT NOW YOU'VE GOT. THAT PIECE OF INFORMATION OUT THERE DOES IT DOES IT JUST DANGLE OFTEN EITHER DOES ANYONE ACTUALLY KNOW ABOUT IT WHEN YOU GET THAT COMMUNICATION TOUCH POINT ESPECIALLY WITH SOMEONE IN A VULNERABLE COMMUNITY YOU GOT TO USE IT EFFICIENTLY. RIGHT YOU DON'T WANT A FLOW CHART THAT READS LIKE A ROCKET TO THE MOON YEAH IT'S GOT TO BE SIMPLE. THAT'S WHEN TAKEN ABSOLUTELY. BUT CENTER PAN. I THANK YOU SO MUCH- AND FIRST BY ONE THANK YOU CENTER STERN FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD CLEARLY IT- TRYING TO ADDRESS A VERY IMPORTANT NEED BE SHARING THAT ENSURING THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE VULNERABLE HAVE THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO HELP. PROTECT THEMSELVES CERTAINLY THE POSITION I'VE SEEN SITUATIONS WHERE- YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE DEPENDENT THIS IS LIFESAVING EQUIPMENT AND IF IT POWER GOES DOWN THERE'S NO POWER FOR IT I MEAN THEY CAN DIE AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT AND I THINK THE I JUST US PROGRAM GIVEN THE POPULATION THAT USES AYE HSS IS ONLY ONE VEHICLE BY WHICH WE CAN COMMUNICATE TO PEOPLE OVER MOST MOST LIKELY WHO NEED THESE TYPES OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS- I UP I DO- ALSO SHARE THE CHAIRS- I THINK OF CONCERNS RIGHT WORD BUT- DESIRE TO SEE MORE OF THE DETAILS FILLED IN- AND- CERTAINLY IS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD I DON'T KNOW- AND SURE WHETHER. SINCE WE DO HAVE THESE QUESTIONS OBVIOUSLY OF DEADLINES AND I WANT TO BE SURE THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD THAT- WHEN WE HAVE MORE THOSE DETAILS THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO WHEN IT COMES BACK TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE WHAT THEY ARE. A SO JUST WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THAT FILLS OUT BUT- CERTAINLY ONE OF THEM'S THE BILL TODAY NO THE TO WORK ON AS WITH THE SPONSORSHIPS AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO MOVE TO THE TIME THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN AND STRONG WELCOME YOUR INPUT HERE- WE'RE TRYING TO GET THINGS MOVING QUICKLY BECAUSE- RINGO THROUGH. ANOTHER A TIME. RIGHT IT'S LIKE WE LEFT ALL THE PC WELL THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK. BUT HAVING NOT. LOAD THIS UP TOO MUCH AND IT'S A SENSITIVE COST FRAMEWORK IN THAT SPACE TO WRITE SO I'M- I'M WARY OF ALL THAT AND I AM JUST THINKING CREATIVELY I MEAN I KEEP THINKING. IF THE I'LL YOU ARE GOING TO EXPAND THE MONEY THAT THEY'RE ALREADY SUPPOSED TO BE SPENDING TO TELL THEIR CUSTOMERS ABOUT IT. WHY SHOULD WE JUST LET THE I JUST AS WORKERS AND CAL HHS. DO THAT THEMSELVES IF THEY ALREADY TALKING TO THOSE SAME PEOPLE SO THOSE ARE IDEAS OF THINGS WHERE. YOU'RE NOT GONNA ADD COST PRESSURE NECESSARILY ALSO ON TO THESE PROGRAMS BUT MAY BE- MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT SO- I WILL HEED YOUR POINT AND- YEAH WELCOME WELCOME THE INPUT GOING FORWARD. I MAY SAY I ALSO MENTIONED THAT BOTH THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL AS MYSELF ALSO SERVE ON THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE SO GOOD. SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT MONEY TO. YEAH LET'S DO IT.
