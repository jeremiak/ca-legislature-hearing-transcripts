OF THESE CLOSURES ON OUR STUDENTS AND CAMPUSES WE KNOW IT'S BEEN A HUGE CHALLENGE FOR OUR- LAST THREE MONTHS FOR. OUR COLLEGE STUDENTS AND CAMPUS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AT THE TRANSITION TO ONLINE HAS BEEN- EASIER FOR SOME THAN OTHERS WE KNOW THERE ARE RISING COSTS WITH OUR CAMPUSES ACROSS THE STATE AS WELL. WELL ESPECIALLY NO SPECIAL FUNDS A LOST REVENUE FROM HOUSING AND PARKING TO ATHLETICS. AND ALL OF OUR SEGMENTS ARE HEMORRHAGING AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT WINNER WE WENT UNDERSTAND THE MAGNITUDE OF THAT TODAY AS WELL AS TALK ABOUT. WHAT WE CAN DO TO KEEP OUR STUDENTS ALL. CAMPUS ANSWER SEOUL A SPEAKING ABOUT STUDENTS THAT'S ONE THING THAT WE'RE PARTICULAR WORRIED ABOUT. WE KNOW THAT SOME OF THE EQUITY GAPS HAVE WHY IN- WHEN THE STUDENTS WERE BARELY HANGING IN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE THIS. COVERT NINETEEN HAS REALLY BEEN A DISASTER FOR THEM. AND THEIR FINANCIAL WHERE WITH ALL TO BE TO BE A COLLEGE STUDENT AND SURVIVE SIXTY EIGHT. AND MANY STUDENTS ARE JUGGLING CARING FOR FAMILIES AND RELATIVES WATER TRYING TO PASS IS STUDYING. HOW THERE. ARE L. WE WITH DAN THE. THIS IS A DIFFICULT AND AS A IS THE- AT THE CASE. ABOUT THAT TO. I ON TOP OF THAT NOW WE FACE MAY BY GAP FREE TO THE SEGMENTS REALLY TO THINGS ONE THE INCREASES FROM THE JAN BY WHAT ARE ALL THE TABLE AND AS WE KNOW ALL THE SEGMENT HAD ARTICULATED THOSE WERE BARELY ENOUGH TO HANG ON THE FIRST PLACE SO THAT'S A DOUBLE DOUBLE HIT THOSE ARE GONE AND THE SECOND HERE IT IS. IS THE FACT THAT. THERE MAY BE A ADDITIONAL CUTS IF WE DON'T GET OUR FEDERAL STIMULUS MONEY THROUGH THE NEXT ROUND SO WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THEIR THE PROPOSED. 10% CUTS ACROSS THE BOARD- AS FAR AS FINANCIAL AID- YOU KNOW WE'RE FORTUNATE THAT THAT MAY REVISED- PROPOSAL- PRETTY MUCH SPARE IS THE CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS- PRIDE ON THE OPPORTUNITY FOR CAL GRANT REFORM EXPANSION THIS YEAR- MISTER MEDINA WHICH YOU ARE WORKING ON BUT- AT LEAST WE'RE NOT GOING TO- WHACKED THESE PROGRAMS AND FURTHER HIM. SB BILLET PAY FOR COLLEGE AND AS WE DO TAKE A LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL CUTS AND AS I SAID YESTERDAY. WE SHOULD WE TALK ABOUT WHAT IS OUR WHAT IS OUR PLAN BEING PLANCY WE SHOULD NECESSARILY- A KNOWLEDGE THAT. IF WE DON'T GET THE FEDERAL MONIES FOR THE SECOND ROUND OF THE OF THE STIMULUS THAT. THESE TRIGGER CUTS WHAT HAPPENED NEED TO THINK ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT OTHER OPTIONS WE HAVE WHETHER TO INCREASE REVENUES GOING TO THE VOTERS INTERNAL BORROWING I THINK THEY'RE A LOT OF TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX INTO FOR A FULL THE VALUE BEFORE WE AKE A LOOK. AT CUTS BUT IF WE HAVE TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD. I THINK WE SHOULD REALLY CONSIDER USING A SCALPEL AND NOT THE AXE- LAST COUPLE YEARS WE TALKED ABOUT SOME AREAS OF UC AND CSU. AND THE FIVE THEY HAVE IN THE ADMIN SITE. MAYBE THEY'LL SHOULD TAKE MORE OF A CUT THANK STUDENT THEN- FUNDING AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL WHERE THEY HAVE A MORE DIRECT IMPACT ON STUDENTS. AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AS WE KNOW WE HAVE LITTLE ACCESS MONEY AND CAL BRIGHT ONLINE COLLEGE SYSTEM SO THERE ARE A FEW. PLACES WE THINK WE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK BEFORE. A DRASTIC- GO AFTER OUR STUDENTS AND OUR CAMPUSES SO. I WILL DO THAT WE BEGIN. KHN ATION. THAT THE E. L. L. PERMANENT. AND SEE SEE CA. A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND STUDENT. ARE GONNA HEAR ALL. I'M SKEWS ME YES ORGAN HERE ALL. OF THE- OF THE- PANELISTS- AND THEN WE WILL GET TO- QUESTIONS ENGAGEMENT FROM THE MEMBERS- SO WE'RE NOT GONNA JUST ONE IN A TIME THAT MEMBERS ARE GOING TO HAVE THEM ALL GO AND THEN WE WILL. ENGAGE BUT BEFORE WE START ANY COMMENTS TO QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS I SEE MISTER MEDINA. MR MEDINA THANK YOU MISTER MCCARTY. CLOUT THE DISCUSS WE'RE HAVING HERE TODAY IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I TAKE LIGHTLY. ESPECIALLY IS THE CHAIR OF HIGHER EDUCATION. IT IS A STARK CONTRAST TO THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD ABOUT REFORMING THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM. AS MR MCCARTY A NOTED EARLIER. TO INCREASE ACCESS ELIGIBILITY AND AWARDS TO HELP MORE STUDENTS. TO FOR THE COST OF COLLEGE. TO BE SITTING HERE NOW FACING A SIGNIFICANT BUDGET DEFICIT. IS DEVASTATING. EVERY CUT TO HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING REPRESENTS A STIFLED ACADEMIC ENVIRONMENT. POTENTIAL FACULTY PARTTIME FACULTY AND STAFF LAYOFFS. INCREASE BARRIERS FOR STUDENTS PURSUING A COLLEGE DEGREE. AND GROWING STUDENT DEBT. THE PANDEMIC IS CREATED A NEW ECONOMIC REALITY. ONCE THE ONE THAT WE HAVE TO RECONCILE AS WE WORK TO DEVELOP A BALANCED BUDGET. AS THE GOVERNOR SAID AS PER PRESS CONFERENCE LAST WEEK. ALL MADE IT. LIFTING CALIFORNIA'S VALUES DURING THIS THIS IS STORE BURKE SURE. THAT WE HAVE. THE TENANTS OF EQUITY EQUALITY ACCESS ACROSS THE STATE. AND AT THE LOWER LEVEL AS WE MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS. AND PRIOR. TIES ARE UNDER WRAPS SENATE. AND FIRST DURATION STUDENTS. THOUGH WE HAVE TOUGH CONVERSATIONS AHEAD. I ALSO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT OUR DECISIONS NOT ARE. OR WHOLE GENERATION OF STUDENTS. THOSE WHO ARE READY HIGHER CASE INSTITUTIONS. AND THOSE RECEIPTS. AND WE IN LEGISLATURE NEED TO X. DO DEL. TO REDUCE THE PROGRAM AND PRIORITIZE THE FUNDING OF WITH THE GRAY NEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YES THANK YOU FOR SENDING IT UP AS WELL MR MEDINA. WE KNOW THAT YOU CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THIS CHAIRING THE HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE AND UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACTS OF THESE BUDGET. DECISIONS ARE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT TODAY SO WITH THAT LET'S HAVE THE LA- WALK IS THROUGH THE MAY REVISE HOW IT RELATES TO OUR CALIFORNIA A YES- WE'RE ALSO JOINED TODAY BY OUR BUDGET SHARE A MISTER TING WHO WHO WOULD LIKE TO. SAY SOMETHING AS WELL JUST VERY VERY I THINK. WE'RE PROBABLY RIVERSIDE IS THE CELL. I WANTED THE ISSUE THE ISSUE A WHOLE FIFTY TO HAVE ACCESS. BUT ALSO SURE THAT WE HAVE BEEN CHRIS EQUITY I THINK THREE IN DELIBERATIONS OF THE GET HELP PUBLIC RIVERSIDE VERY GOOD VERY VERY WELL THAT WE SHOULD. CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON. HOW THE- OUR- FIRST REFORM OF BOTH THEIR ARCS THIS WILL THEIR EDUCATION SO IF WE HAPPEN TO IT. I THINK THEY ARE ACROSS THE- TEMPERATURES BECAUSE SCENES THAT LIKE A LITTLE COVERS YOU THE ANSWER I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK A LITTLE BIT DEEPER TO THE SIDE ARE THERE AREAS WHERE SHE WHICH SHOULD BE CUT MORE AS SUCH AS ADMINISTRATION AND OVERHEAD. IN AREAS THAT SHOULD BE SPARED SUCH AS STUDENT AID AND FACULTY SO I THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE THOSE VERY TOUGH DECISIONS I KNOW THAT WELL NONE OF US WERE HERE DURING THE LAST. BUDGET CRISIS I LOOK AROUND THE ROOM AND I KNOW MANY OF US FOR A CITY COUNCILS. AND COMMUNICATE WITH PORTS ON SCHOOL BOARDS WERE WE HAD TO MAKE VERY VERY TOUGH DECISIONS THEY HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY SO WE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S AT STAKE. BUT AGAIN I FEEL VERY- HONORED TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE WITH EVERYBODY AND THE WEALTH OF EXPERIENCE THAT JUST IN THIS ROOM BUT ALSO WITHIN OUR ASSEMBLY CHAMBER I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND I OR TIES. EDUCATIONAL ACCESS AND EQUITY HOW WILL MAKE YOU SOME VERY VERY DIFFICULT DECISION SO THANK YOU. OKAY WITH THAT LET'S ASK THE- LA TO BEGIN. JENNIFER BUT SHALLOW WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE YOU SHOULD HAVE A HAND OUT IN FRONT OF YOU ENTITLED OVERVIEW AND ASSESSMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION MAY REVISION PROPOSALS. AND THE NEIGHBOR VISION HAS MANY HIGHER EDUCATION PROPOSALS THE HAND THAT IS INTENDED TO SHOW YOU ALL OF THOSE PROPOSALS APART FROM A FEW WORKLOAD AND LANGUAGE ONLY ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE SAKE OF TIME I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON JUST THE LARGER OF THE PROPOSAL'S. PAGE ONE OF THE HANDOUT. SUMMARIZES THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE MAY REVISION PROPOSAL AS YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE STATE HAS A LARGE BUDGET PROBLEM. THE GOVERNOR IS TAKING A MIX OF BUDGET STRATEGIES TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM WITHIN HIGHER EDUCATION GOVERNOR USES THE SAME A STRATEGY OF TAKING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF BUDGET. SOLUTIONS THE FIRST THING HE DOES IS WITHDRAW THE ALMOST ALL OF THE JANUARY PROPOSALS JANUARY AUGMENTATIONS SO FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES HE WITH PROCESS PROPOSALS TO GIVE A COLA. HE READ IF DRAWS HIS HALF A PERCENT ENROLLMENT GROWTH PROPOSAL. FOR THE UNIVERSITY'S HE WITHDRAWS THE PROPOSALS TO PROVIDE 5% BASING CREE SAYS. HE RESENTS ALMOST ALL OF THE ONE TIME INITIATIVES THAT HE HAD IN PLACE- HE ALSO RESIDENTS THINGS LIKE AUGMENTING APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS IN A FEW CASES HE DOESN'T REST AND THE JANUARY PROPOSAL IN ITS ENTIRETY. I'M IN THE CASE FOR EXAMPLE OF THE UC RIVERSIDE MED SCHOOL AND THE UCSF FRESNO BRANCH CAMPUS HE JUST SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCES THE SIZE OF THOSE AUGMENTATIONS. THE GOVERNOR ALSO RESIDENTS JUST A FEW OF THE NINETEEN TWENTY ONE TIME INITIATIVES MOST NOTABLY HERE SINCE THE EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION THAT THE STATE PROVIDED ONE TIME LAST YEAR FOR A TEACHER AND SIGNED OF PROGRAM. I'M AS YOU KNOW IT'S VERY COMMON FOR NEW PROGRAMS- TO TAKE SOME TIME TO IMPLEMENT TO HAVE UNSPENT MONEYS EARLY ON. SO AFTER HE WITHDRAWS THE BASE AUGMENTATIONS HE HIT THEM PROPOSES BASS REDUCTION. FOR THE COLLEGES HE HAS AN 8% REDUCTION TO APPORTIONMENT. AND THEN WITH SELECTIVE OTHER CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS THE REDUCTIONS RANGE FROM 10% 258% FOR THE UNIVERSITY IS THE GOVERNOR HAS 10% BASE REDUCTIONS I TO THEIR GENERAL FUND SUPPORT AND BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITIES HAVE A MIX OF GENERAL FUND AND STUDENT TUITION REVENUE THOSE EQUATE TO ABOUT A 5% REDUCTION IN OUR COURT. THINKING UNLIKE PRODUCTIONS FOR THE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THE MAY REVISION KEEPS OF FUNDING FOR FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS INTACT WITH NO PROPOSED REDUCTIONS. AND THIS APPLIES BOTH TO NEED BASED PROGRAMS LIKE THE CAL GRANT AS WELL AS NON NEED BASED PROGRAMS LIKE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM. CONSISTENT WITH JANUARY GOVERNOR PROPOSES NO CHANGES ARE NO INCREASES IN TUITION. AND ALSO HE SUCKS NO ENROLLMENT EXPECTATIONS FOR THE UNIVERSITY IN FOR THE COLLEGE IT'S THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND NOT HE HAS THE BASE REDUCTION TO APPORTIONMENT BUT EXPECT THEM TO SERVE ABOUT AS MANY STUDENTS IN THE BUDGET YEAR AS THEIR STERN SERVING NOW. THE LAST MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE ME REVISION HIGHER EDUCATION PACKAGES THE TRIGGER THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT IF THE STATE WHERE TO GET FOURTEEN BILLION IN ADDITIONAL- FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDING. THAT WOULD GO TO HOWEVER SEND ALL OF THESE I'M ALMOST ALL OF THE PROPOSED REDUCTIONS IT WOULD BE ALL OR NOTHING ALL OF THE RESTORATIONS WOULD BE APPLIED FOR NONE OF THEM. AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE FIGURE MOST OF THE REDUCTIONS WOULD BE RESTORED AND VIRTUALLY ALL OF THOSE REDUCTIONS ARE ON GOING SO EVEN THOUGH THE FEDERAL RELIEF MONEY IF THAT MATERIALIZES WILL BE VERY LIKELY ONE TIME. IT WOULD BE USING TO SUSTAIN ONGOING PROGRAM. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE OF THE HAND OUT IT'LL SHOW YOU ALL OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE PROPOSALS YOU CAN SEE THE A PORTION MEGA KAT OF A HUNDRED- I'M SORRY. OF FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE MILLION BUT YOU CAN ALSO SEE SIGNIFICANT CUTS TO ADULT EDUCATION TIME PERCENT 58% CUT TO THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FOUR IT SHOWS- THE REACTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO THE GOVERNOR'S NAY REVISION FOR THE COLLEGE AS- WE KNOW THE STATE'S FACING VERY HARD BUDGET SITUATION WE THINK THEY'RE ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH OF USING MANY DIFFERENT BUDGET TOOLS IS APPROPRIATE. BUT WE THINK THAT AS A CHURCH WAS MENTIONED IN THE BEGINNING OF THE HEARING THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO BE MORE STRATEGIC MORE TARGETED MORE SELECTIVE IN HOW YOU GO ABOUT ACHIEVING YOUR ADOPTION. WE ALSO THINK THERE ARE SOME OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE BUDGET LANDSCAPE TO IDENTIFY SOME LOTTERY FUNDS THAT YOU COULD REPURPOSE SOME UNSPENT. ONE TIME- NINETEEN TWENTY FUNDS EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FUNDS THAT COULD BE YOUR BEST. I'M WHAT'S THAT WE THINK WE'VE TRIED TO IDENTIFY SOME LOWER PRIORITY PROGRAMS THAT YOU COULD SWAP OUT WITH CUTS TO APPORTIONMENT FOR EXAMPLE. WERE ALSO SOMEWHAT CONCERNED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S TRIGGER APPROACH AND NOT FOR THE COLLEGES FOR EXAMPLE IF THE MONEY DOES MATERIALIZE IT WOULD NOT ONLY RESTORE THE BASE REDUCTION OF 8% TO A PORTION MEN'S BUT ALSO THE COLA. SO THE STARTING POINT YOU WOULD BE WORKING FROM NEXT YEAR WOULD BE EVEN HIGHER THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROGRAMMATIC CUTS IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO MIGHT SEEM EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT FOR THEIR FEELINGS TO YOU RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE TO TURN IT IS THAT YOU COULD CONSIDER ON PAGE FIVE WE SHOW THE ALTERNATIVE THAT WE'VE LAID OUT FOR PORTION THAT. IT WAS ALSO WAS TO ACHIEVE THE SAME LEVEL GENERAL FUND SAVINGS AS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS A MEMEBER VISION BUT TO ACHIEVE IT DIFFERENTLY SO THE COMMENTS ARE THERE JUST FOR YOUR REFERENCE DOWN THE ROAD BUT IF YOU FOCUS ON THE DOLLAR CHANGES. I'M THE PACKAGE WOULD ELIMINATE ONE NON NEED BASED PROGRAM. IT WOULD ELIMINATE A BRIGHT. I'M A COLLEGE THAT WAS RECENTLY CREATED NOT BY THE STATE IT WOULD REDIRECT SOME MONEY THAT CURRENTLY SPORTS TEAMS TO. EARN FOR THEIR PER. IN BUT THAT COMES AS AND- IT WOULD STOP THAT PRACTICE. IT WAS THE- DESTRUCTION THAT THE STATE CURRENTLY PLAYS LOTTERY FUNDS TO ALLOW COLLEGES TO USE THOSE FUNDS FOR ONLINE TECHNOLOGY AND RESOURCES SOMETHING THAT'S OBVIOUSLY HIGH DEMAND RIGHT NOW. SO TAKING ALL OF THOSE TARGETED CUTS ACHIEVES ABOUT HALF THE LEVEL OF SAVINGS AS AND THE GOVERNOR'S NAY REVISION. THEN WE THINK THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES TO RE DIRECT ALREADY EXISTING FEDERAL RESOURCES SO AT THE GOVERNOR RIGHT NOW IS USING THE CROWN A RELIEF FUND AND THE GOVERNOR'S EMERGENCY EDUCATION REALLY FIND ENTIRELY FOR SCHOOLS. AND WE THINK YOU COULD CONSIDER USING A PORTION OF THAT FOR THE COLLEGES. SO UNDER THIS KIND OF MORE STRATEGIC APPROACH EVEN IF THE STATE WERE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS IT WOULD HAVE RESERVES OR OTHER FEDERAL RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE NEXT YEAR IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. TO DAMPEN THE REDUCTION NOT PROGRAMS WILL FEEL AS THE ECONOMY- AS AS YOU KNOW THE STATE HAS A STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE THAT RIGHT NOW IS ANTICIPATED TO LAST POTENTIALLY AS LONG AS TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. PAGE SIX LAYS OUT AN ALTERNATIVE FOR YOU TO CONSIDER ON CT. R. THE AIM OF THIS ALTERNATIVE IS TO ALSO REDIRECT FUNDS FROM LOWER PRIORITY PROGRAMS AND UNPROVEN PROGRAMS TO TRY TO SUPPORT THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM. WHICH IS THE PROGRAM NOT THE COLLEGES RECEIVE TO PAY FOR HIGHER C. T. EQUIPMENT COSTS AN INSTRUCTIONAL COSTS. SO WITH A LOT OF FOLKS RIGHT NOW LAID OFF ATTENTION HE WANTED TO GO BACK TO THE COLLEGES TO BE RETRAINED THREE SKILLED THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT COULD HELP THEM DO THAT. SO W TRY TO REDIRECT MONEY FROM THESE LOWER PRIORITY AREAS SO THAT THE STATE COULD IN STATE SUSTAIN ENROLLMENT. IN THOSE EACH YEAR COURSES. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SEVEN IT SHOWS YOU ALL OF THE ADJUSTMENTS FOR CSU. YOU CAN SEE THE A THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT MILLION BASS REDUCTION FOR EXAMPLE FOR CSU. ROACHES SIMILAR WITH WITH TRYING PROPOSALS AND TAKING A BASS REDUCTION. IF YOU GO TO PAGE EIGHT YOU CAN SEE THE SAME APPROACH BEING TAKEN FOR YOU SEEING WITH THE WITHDRAWAL OF JANUARY PROPOSALS ON THE 10% REDUCTION WHICH IN THIS CASE- IS THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT MILLION. I DON'T THE MAIN PAGE OF THE HANDOUT SO PAGE NINE I'M SHOWS YOUR REACTION TO THE MAY REVISION FOR THE UNIVERSITIES I'M HERE WE THINK TO THERE'S SOME MISSED OPPORTUNITIES TO BE MORE TARGETED AND HOW YOU GO ABOUT. BUILDING THEIR BY JETS. I'M ALL OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS ARE GONNA HAVE A HARD TIME RIGHT NOW ADJUSTING THEIR BUDGET SO QUICKLY SUMMER TERM IS STARTING A COUPLE WEEKS FROM NOW AND THE ACADEMIC TERM IS STARTING FOR SOME COMP CAMPUSES. AS EARLY AS OF LATE GUEST SO CAMPUS IS ALREADY HAVING TO DEVELOP COURSE SCHEDULES TO STAFF. SUCH IT'S HARD FOR THEM TO BE SUPER NIMBLE SUPER QUICKLY SO WHAT KIND DO IT JUST GIVE THEM LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO GIVE THEM TWENTY TWENTY ONES THAT THEY CAN PLAN FOR DOCUMENTS THAT. YOU NEED IT DONE OUT. IT PAGE UP AND OUT. OUT IN A LOT OF APPROACH FOR THE UNIVERSE. AND THE FIRST THING IN IN THE UP IS TO A REPURPOSE THE MUCH THE ON SPENT TWENTY NAY TWENTY AS POSSIBLE SO NORM WHEN THE STATE ENTERS A RECESSION THE FIRST THING IT DOES ITS FIRST OURSE OF ACTION IS TO TRY TO FIND EVERY ON SPENT DOLLAR THAT IT CAN. IT SPECIALLY VERY RESEND THING WHERE THE PROGRAM'S HAVEN'T GOTTEN UP AND RUNNING VERY FEW PEOPLE WILL BE AFFECTED IF THOSE DOLLARS ARE REPURPOSE TO SUPPORT THE BASED ON GOING PROGRAM. I SEE MY RECALL LAST YEAR THE STATE PROVIDED BOTH THAT UNIVERSITIES WITH QUITE A BIT OF ONE TIME MONEY FIRST THE ISSUE IT WAS THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE MILLION FOR YOU SEE IT WAS TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN MILLION. MOST OF THAT MONEY AS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE MONEY. AND YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD US SAY THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE RECOVERY HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS TO DEAL WITH UNIVERSITIES MAINTENANCE ISSUES. BUT IN A RECESSION PARTICULAR RECESSION THAT CAME SO QUICKLY AND MIGHT BE SO DEEP IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO CONSIDER RE PURPOSING FOR ONGOING PROGRAMS. THIS WOULD STILL MEAN YOU COULD DEVELOP A LONG TERM PLAN WITH THE UNIVERSITIES TO TRY TO DEAL WITH OUTSTANDING MAINTENANCE ISSUES. OVER THE LONG RUN. THERE'S ALSO SOME OPPORTUNITIES WE THINK THE GOVERNOR WILL BE USED ONE JANUARY AUGMENT. ONE TIME PROPOSAL WE IT'S JUST NOT A PRUDENT TIME TO DO NEW ONE TIME THINGS. HE ANOTHER THING YOU MIGHT CONSIDER IS TARGETED REDUCTIONS SO FIGURE OUT WHERE WHERE WITHIN THE UNIVERSITIES MIGHT BE ANOTHER- A PLACE THAT WOULD HAVE LESS IMPACT ON DIRECT STUDENT SERVICES INSTRUCTION AND SUPPORT SERVICES IN THE BUDGET YEAR. SO WE JUST ILLUSTRATE SIMPLY SHOW YOU WHAT A 10% CUT TO USE THESE THREE STARTS BUDGET WOULD LOOK LIKE JUST THE STATE GENERAL FUND. OF FLEXIBLE PORTION OF THEIR RESEARCH- IF THE STATE WERE TO TAKE A 10% CUT TO THAT HOT WHICH EQUATES TO ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN MILLION. IT WOULD STILL HAVE FOUR POINT EIGHT BILLION IN FEDERAL PRIVATE RESTRICTED IN SPECIAL FUND RESOURCES FOR RESEARCH WHICH WE KNOW IS CORE TO THEIR MISSION. SO THE LAST THING THEN WOULD BE WORKING WITH THE SEGMENTS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD BE A REASONABLE EXPECTATION TO JOT DOWN THEIR INTERNAL UNRESTRICTED RESERVES. AS AN EFFORT TO PRESERVE ONGOING PROGRAM. SO WE PENCILLED IN HERE JUST A STARTING POINT FOR CSU OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION AND FOR YOU SEE OF ONE HUNDRED MILLION. BUT THESE WOULD BE PURPOSEFUL AGREEMENTS WITH THE STATEMENTS TO BE DRAWING DOWN RESERVES IN THIS TIME TO BE SUPPORTING THOSE PROGRAMS. IN THE BUDGET YEAR. SO THE LAST POINT IS ARE WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO HAVE REPORTING OR LANGUAGE ALMOST REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU DO THAT WOULD HAVE THE SEGMENTS REPORT BACK TO YOU PERHAPS IN THE FALL MAYBE BY NOVEMBER. ABOUT THEIR ENROLLMENTS THEIR UNRESTRICTED RESERVES THEIR RESTRICTED RESERVES THEIR OPERATING EFFICIENCIES THEIR OPERATING REDUCTIONS AND THEIR TUITION PLANS AND HOW THEY'RE AB REDUCTIONS ARE IMPACTING DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS FOR BOTH WHAT THEY PERCEIVE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. TO HELP YOU PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE. OUR PRIMARY GOAL IN ALL THESE ALTERNATIVES YOU CAN TAKE THEM AND PART OR YOU CAN TAKE THEM AND HOLE YOU CAN TAKE PIECES OF A ONE BUT NOT THE OTHER BUT THEY'RE ALL INTENDED TO GIVE YOU A REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE. FOR YOU TO CONTEMPLATE. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT- THEM AND AS WELL AS OUR WHOLE UNIT WORKING WITH YOU AND YOUR STOCK OVER THE COMING FEW DAYS AND WEEKS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE TRADE OFF AND WOULD BE. THANKS. OKAY THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON MEMBERS. DAN HAD ARE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SOME OF THIS WILL ECHO THE PRESENTATION PROVIDED BY MY CALL I GET THE LA L. BUT I'M GONNA AGAIN WITH A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE NAY REVISION FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. AS WELL AS THE MAJOR SPENDING PROPOSALS FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND THEN HANDED OFF TO MY COLLEAGUES JENNIFER LOUIS WHO DISCUSSED THE REMAINDER FROM THE REVISION PROPOSALS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. IN LIGHT OF THE COVER NINETEEN. DOING RECESSION THE MAYOR VISION FOR HIGHER EDUCATION FOCUSES ON TWO KEY PRINCIPLES THE CONTINUED EMPHASIS ON SUSTAINING AND IMPROVING ACCESS AND EQUITY. AND A COMMITMENT TO A BALANCED BUDGET. DESPITE ITS ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THE ADMINISTRATION REMAINS COMMITTED TO MAXIMIZING ACCESS AND EQUITY. THE ADMINISTRATION US OF THE STATE'S COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. DO ALL THEY CAN'T SUPPORT CALIFORNIA IT STUDENTS DURING THIS DIFFICULT TIME. TO THAT END THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED TO ENSURE THAT THE CAL GRANT AND MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS REMAIN UNTOUCHED FOR ALL STUDENTS WHO ARE CURRENTLY. OR PLANNING TO ATTEND ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S INSTITUTIONS A PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION. THE GOAL OF THIS IS TO ENSURE THE HIGHER EDUCATION REMAINS AN OPTION FOR STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ECONOMIC STATUS. ADDITIONALLY THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD LIKE TO SEE COLLEGES. AND UNIVERSITIES CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS PROVIDING FULLY ONLINE EDUCATE. EDUCATION OPTIONS. WITH AN EMPHASIS ON ENSURING THAT UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENT GROUPS. ARE ABLE TO ENROLL AND SUCCEED IN THESE PROGRAMS. ALTHOUGH THIS IS A TIME OF CONSTRAINED RESOURCES THE SHIP ONLINE EDUCATION PROVIDES OPTIONS SUCH AS THE USE OF COMMON ONLINE LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION AND CREDIT FOR PRIOR LEARNING THAT CAN PROVIDE GREATER FLEXIBILITY AND EFFICIENCY. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT EACH OF THE SEGMENTS THIS MEETING IS PRIORITY THE ADMINISTRATION CALLS ON EACH OF THE SEGMENTS TO ESTABLISH THIS TO MICHAEL'S SPECIFYING. THE PERCENTAGE OF ONLINE COURSES BEING OFFERED IN THE OF STUDENTS CREDIT. THE COMPANY BUT COMPETENT BASED THE EDGE. AND CREDIT BY EXAM. RESPONSE TO DECLINING ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES. THE STATE NEEDS TO TAKE SIGNIFICANT STEPS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A BALANCED BUDGET. MOST OF THE NEW SPENDING PROPOSALS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAVE BEEN WITHDRAWN AND IN MANY AREAS SIGNIFICANT FURTHER REDUCTIONS ARE NECESSARY. I WOULD NOT THAT FOR SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS WE'VE INCLUDED LANGUAGE THAT WOULD RESTORE THE PROPOSED REDUCTIONS. IF SUFFICIENT NEW FEDERAL FUNDING IS PROVIDED TO. WITH THAT WE WILL BEGIN LISTING SOME OF THE MAJOR NEW PROPOSALS IN EACH AREA STARTING WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. FIRST AS I PREVIOUSLY REFERENCED THE MAYOR VISION WITHDRAWS MOST OF THE NEW PROPOSALS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THE TWO NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS TO THIS FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE TEN MILLION DOLLARS THE PROPOSITION NINE NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. PROVIDED FOR LEGAL SERVICES FOR UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF. AT THIS POPULATION WILL FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CLIMATE. AND A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS NON PROPOSITION NINETY GENERAL FUND FOR AN ACCOUNTING POSITION AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THAT WILL BE ESSENTIAL IN HELPING THE SYSTEM IN THIS TIME OF SCARCE RESOURCES. ADDITIONALLY WE WERE NOT THAT ALTHOUGH FUNDING HAS BEEN REMOVED FOR THE DREAMER RESOURCE THE IS ON. AND FOOD PANTRIES. THE BILL LANGUAGE HAS BEEN INCLUDED TO REQUIRE COLLEGES TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING STUDENT EQUITY AND ACHIEVEMENT PROGRAM FUNDS. ADDITIONALLY ALL COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS PROVIDED A CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE BEEN WITHDRAWN TO REFLECT THE COLOR SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEE LEVEL AN OVERALL BUDGETARY REVENUES ADDITIONAL MEASURES ARE NEEDED TO HELP PROTECT THE FISCAL STABILITY OF THE STATE. TO ADDRESS THIS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INCLUDED NECESSARY REDUCTIONS TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUDGET. AT THE LARGE PROPOSALS INCLUDED ARE IN A PORTION IS TO FOR ALL OF THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY POINT ONE MILLION. FROM CURRENT YEAR OR- FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWO THE BUDGET YEAR FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN APARTMENTS DEFERRAL OF SIX HUNDRED SIXTY TWO POINT ONE MILLION. FROM BUDGET YEAR- TO OF FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TO THE SUBSEQUENT YOUR- FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. IN A REDUCTION TO THE STUDENT CENTER FUNDING FORMULA. OF 10% WHICHWHEN COMBINED WITH THE WHEN COMBINED WITH THE REMOVAL OF THE COLA TOUGH TOTALING ROUGHLY SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. WE WOULD NOT TO THE MAYOR VISION INCLUDES LANGUAGE SPECIFYING THAT IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL FUNDING. IN THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE SKILLED. SIR REDUCTIONS NECESSARY TO ACCOMMODATE REDUCED ESTIMATES OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY GUARANTEE IN THE BUDGET YEAR INCLUDE. REDUCTION OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION. TO THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM. WHICH WOULD BE THE NEW PRODUCT- FUNDING- FOR THE PROGRAM AND A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AND SOME ROUGHLY 15% REDUCTIONS FOR DIFFERENT CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS. WHICH ARE A SIXTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION TO THE STUDENT EQUITY AND ACHIEVEMENT PROGRAM. IN EIGHTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION TO THE SYSTEM SUPPORT CONSOLIDATION. HUNDRED AND FIFTY REDUCTION TO THE ACADEMIC SENATE A SEVEN POINT ONE MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION TO THE PART TIME FACULTY COMPETITION IN OFFICE HOURS PROGRAMS AND A AND A THREE MILLION DOLLAR PRODUCTION TO TOP RIGHT COLLEGE. FINALLY THE MAYOR VISION ALSO INCLUDES NEW PIECES OF CRITICAL LANGUAGE THE HELP TO ENACT THE PREVIOUSLY SPECIFIED PROPOSALS. THE MEDICINE ALSO INCLUDES DVR SECTIONS THAT WOULD CODIFY TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY RATES ANALYSIS COMPLETED BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. AND EXCLUDE. OPEN NINETEEN RELATED COSTS FROM 50% ALL. THIS MAYOR VISION X. INCLUDES ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL CHANGES BUT THESE ARE RELATIVELY SMALL AND ARE MEANT TO REFLECT CHANGES IN REPORTED WORK LET. WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE JENNIFER. AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS JENNIFER LEE ON BEHALF OF DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AS MY COLLEAGUE DAN HUNTER OR DISCUSSED IN LIGHT OF THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND DOING RECESSION. THERE A REVISION REFLECTS THE ADMINISTRATION'S EMPHASIS. ON SUSTAINING ACCESS AND EQUITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION. AND A COMMITMENT TO A BALANCED BUDGET. OVER HOPE PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE NAY REVISION PROPOSALS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. THE CALIFORNIA STATE DO NOT HELP FOR INSTANCE IT COMMISSION.

CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND THE CALIFORNIA MANY COLLEGES TO USE RESTRICTED BALANCES. FROM PARKING FEES UNIVERSITY ENTERPRISE AND OTHER ARTILLERY ACTIVITIES EXCEPT LOTTERY BALANCES TO COVER KOPEN NINETEEN RELATED IMPACTS. AND KOBE NINETEEN RELATED REVENUE LOSSES. THE LANGUAGE WOULD REQUIRE THE CSU AND THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES I REQUEST THE UC THE FIRST USE ANY RESTRICTED FUND BALANCES TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS TO PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. THAT PREDOMINATELY SUPPORT UNDER REPRESENTED IS DOING ACCESS TO AS A SUCCESS AT A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY AND TO EXPAND THE NUMBER STUDENTS ANNUALLY SIR IN ALL MY COURSES AND PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION THE ADMINISTRATION WILL ALSO PURSUE STATUTORY CHANGES AUTHORIZING THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. TO TEMPORARILY RE DIRECT SAVINGS. FROM DEBT SERVICING TOWARDS SUMMER USES. THEY MAY REVISION MAINTAIN SEVERAL HOLES FOR THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SYSTEM INCLUDING ELEVEN POINT THREE MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND FOR UC RIVERSIDE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO SUPPORT CURRENT OPERATIONS ONE POINT TWO MILLION ON GOING DOWN ARE FINE FOR A UCSF SCHOOL OF MEDICINE FRESNO BRANCH CAMPUS TO SUPPORT AN EXISTING UCSF UC MERCED PARTNERSHIP.

THE FOUR MILLION FOR YOU SEE AND SIX MILLION FIRST ISSUE THAT REFLECT A LIMITED TIME FUNDING FOR SUMMER FINANCIAL AID AND INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT. THE MAY REVISION ALSO PROPOSES FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS AND MAKES THEM CONTINGENT ON FEDERAL FUNDING. UNLESS AND UNTIL SUFFICIENT INCREASES AND FEDERAL SUPPORT ARE AVAILABLE FOR PROGRAM RESTORATION. THESE REDUCTIONS ARE NECESSARY TO BALANCE THE STATE BUDGET. THREE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S MAIN GENERAL FUND ITEM AND THREE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT MILLION FROM CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. EACH REFLECTING A POINT FOUR MILLION FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S OTHER GENERAL FUND ITEM FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT.

THE MINISTER CAN EXPECT THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND THE CALIFORNIA MANY COLLEGES WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD MAXIMIZING ACCESS AND EQUITY DESPITE THE CONSTRAINT RESOURCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CO THE NINETEEN RECESSION. TO THIS AD AT THE ADMINISTRATION EXPECTS THAT THESE REDUCTIONS IN FUNNY WILL NOT HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON LOW INCOME. UNDER REPRESENTED FOR DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS. MOVING NOW TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE THE COMMISSION. AND FINANCIAL AID. THEY MAY REVISION MAINTAIN ALL FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS FOR PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS. TO SUPPORT COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY.

AND UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS NO EXCEPTION. THE UNIVERSITY MAKES TO ASKS OF THE STATE. TO APPROVE A BUDGET THAT MAINTAINS TO UNIVERSITY STATE GENERAL FUND ALLOCATION AT THE LEVELS PROVIDED. IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN. AND TO THE GREATEST DEGREE POSSIBLE AS THE STATE RECEIVES FEDERAL FUNDS IT CONSIDERED UNIVERSITY. AS A STRONG INVESTMENT. IT'S LIKE TO DETAILS UNIVERSITIES COVERED NINETEEN RELATED FINANCIAL LOSSES THROUGH APRIL THIRTIETH A TOTAL OF NEARLY ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. IN EXPENDITURES AND LOST REVENUES. AT WORLD'S LARGEST PUBLIC RESEARCH UNIVERSITY OUR ACADEMIC HEALTH CENTERS ARE TREATING PATIENTS. OUR RESEARCHERS ARE SEEKING THERAPY CENTER VACCINE. WE ARE PROVIDING OUR TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS WITH REMOTE CONSTRUCTION. AND CONTINUING TO EMPLOY OUR HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. THE UNIVERSITY HAS ACCESS. OVER TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION IN FEDERAL SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE CARE SUCKED ONE HALF OF WHICH GOES TO CAMPUSES AND THE OTHER HALF IS DIRECT EMERGENCY GRANTS TO STUDENTS.

AGAIN THIS WILL NOT FULLY COVERED THE FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION IN LOST REVENUES FROM CANCEL SURGERIES AND OTHER MEDICAL CARE. THE UNIVERSITY WILL ALSO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF FEMUR REIMBURSEMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR PANDEMIC RELATED COSTS. BUT FEMA REIMBURSE BUT REVERSES ACTUAL EXPENDITURES AND NOT LOST REVENUES. DO THE COLBERT NINETEEN IMPACTS CAMPUSES HAVE LOST FLEXIBILITY WITH FUNDING. WE HAVE COSTS IN EVERY AREA OF OUR OPERATIONS AND WE DON'T GET NO WHERE THE BOTTOM IS. HI THERE PRIOR ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS THE UNIVERSITY HAD OPTIONS FOR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL BORROWING THE CUSHION PRODUCTIONS AND NOW THAT OPTION FOR BORROWING IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THE SAME WAY. WE ARE NOW FAR MORE CONSTRAINED WITHOUT CONTEXT IN MIND I ASK YOU TO TURN TO SLIDE THREE. THE CHART ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF SLIDE THREE SHOWS THE CORE FUNDS FOR STUDENTS. EACH BAR ON THE CHART PRESENTS A TOTAL EXPENDITURE PER STUDENT ALTHOUGH THE TOTAL AMOUNT. MOST RECENT YEARS. OF SHOWS THE FINANCIAL AID OUR RETIREMENT PROGRAM CONTRIBUTIONS AND UNIVERSITIES DEBT SERVICE. ARE TAKING UP AN INCREASINGLY LARGE AMOUNT OF CAMPUS FUNDING. THIS MEANS THAT ARE AVAILABLE DOLLARS PER STUDENT ARE NOW ABOUT THE SAME AS THEY WERE IN TWENTY TEN. WE ALSO BASED ON CERTAIN REGARDING OUR INTERNATIONAL ENROLLMENT ARE NON RESIDENT STUDENTS CONTRIBUTE NEARLY ONE POINT THREE BILLION THE CAMPUS BUDGET THROUGH SUPPLEMENTAL TUITION PAID PAY. AT THIS TIME WE DO NOT KNOW IF ARE NON RESIDENT STUDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO RETURN OR IF THEY WILL CHOOSE TO RETURN TO THEIR STUDIES IN THE FALL. THIS COULD IMPACT THE FUNDS THE CAMPUSES HAVE TO RELY UPON TO EDUCATE OUR STUDENTS. IN THIS CASE THIS IS THE CONTEXT IN WHICH YOU ARE ASKED TO CONSIDER THE GOVERNOR'S ME REVISED RECOMMENDATION OF A 10% REDUCTION THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THE UNIVERSITY ONLY HAS THREE POSSIBLE WAYS OF DEALING WITH REVENUE LOSSES. CUTTING EXPENDITURES INCREASING REVENUES ARE USING RESERVES. CAMPUS CORE FUND RESERVES ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO DEAL WITH THESE UNEXPECTED COSTS. OF I ASK YOU TO PLEASE TURN TO SLIDE FOR TO SEE HOW THE UNIVERSITY HAS INITIALLY DEALT WITH THESE UNEXPECTED EXPENDITURES AND LOST REVENUES. COLLECTIVELY ALL UC CHANCELLORS OF PRESENT APPALLED TANO ANNOUNCED ON APRIL SECOND THAT THERE WOULD BE NO COVERT NINETEEN RELATED LAYOFFS. FOR CAREER EMPLOYEES THROUGH THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR ON JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY. THIS DECISION WAS MADE TO GIVE PEACE OF MIND TO OUR VALUED EMPLOYEES AS THE THIRD LARGEST EMPLOYER IN THE STATE UC'S ACTIONS IN KEEPING PEOPLE EMPLOYED HAS POSITIVELY IMPACTED LOCAL ECONOMIES. HOWEVER CONTINUED TO PAY EMPLOYEES WHEN MULTIPLE COMPONENTS OF OUR REVENUE HAVE EXPERIENCED TREMENDOUS LOSSES IT'S NOT POSSIBLE WITHOUT SUSTAINED. STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS. SO FAR TO CONTAIN COSTS AND CUT EXPENDITURES UC HAS TAKEN A NUMBER OF STEPS THESE INCLUDE A SYSTEM WIDE FOR USE ON SALARIES FOR NON REPRESENTED STAFF. A SYSTEM WIDE FOR USE ON SALARY SCALES FOR NON STUDENT ACADEMIC OF APPOINTEES A VOLUNTARY PAY CUT OF 10% FOR CURRENT CHANCELLOR SENT PRESIDENT. ELIMINATING NON ESSENTIAL TRAVEL AND RENEGOTIATING PROFESSIONAL SERVICE AGREEMENTS. SLIDE FIVE SHOWS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THE GOVERNORS MAY REVISED PROPOSAL REDUCES UNIVERSITIES BUDGET BY 10% OR THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO MILLION FROM THE NINETEEN TWENTY FUNDING LEVEL. WE BELIEVE THAT PRODUCTION SO UNIVERSITIES BASED BUDGET COMBINED WITH INCREASES COST IN LOST REVENUES THE UNIVERSITY EXPERIENCE IS EXPERIENCING WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE ABILITY. IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER INSTRUCTION CONDUCT RESEARCH AND CARE FOR PATIENTS. WITH THEREFORE REQUEST THAT YOU HOLD THE UNIVERSITIES BASED BUDGET FLAT FOR THE CURRENT YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY. TO THE BUDGET YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE ALSO SEEK YOUR ASSISTANCE IN RECEIVING AS MUCH FEDERAL FUNDING COMING TO CALIFORNIA'S POSSIBLE WE REQUEST THIS BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITY IS GOING TO BE IN ROLLING ADDITIONAL STEPS THIS FALL. WE ARE COMMITTED TO ENSURING THESE INCOMING CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES RECEIVED THE EDUCATION THEY DESERVE. IN PRIOR RECESSIONS UNIVERSITY RAISE REVENUES WHICH HELP COUNTER LOSSES IN STATE GENERAL FUND TO MAINTAIN ACCESS. AFFORDABILITY AND QUALITY. BUT IN THIS COVERT INDUCED RECESSION WE KNOW THAT MULTIPLE REVENUE SOURCES HAVE BEEN IMPACTED ON ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS STAFF AND FACULTY. THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE ALSO CONTINUES TO MAKE MUCH NEEDED INVESTMENTS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION INCLUDING ELEVEN POINT THREE MILLION FOR UC'S UC RIVERSIDE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. UNIVERSITY CONTINUES TO REQUEST TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR THE UC RIVERSIDE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE BECAUSE THE SCHOOL IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO EXPAND MEDICAL EDUCATION IN A REGION THAT HAS BEEN MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED FOR FAR TOO LONG. AND THAT CONCLUDES THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PORTION OF MY PRESENTATION I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO MAKE A STATEMENT FOR UC HASTINGS. THIS IS ON BEHALF OF THE HASTINGS COLLEGE OF THE LAW OF THE CFO DAVID STEWART. HASTINGS COLLEGE OF THE LAW FOUNDED IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IS A STRONG AND RESILIENT INSTITUTION DEDICATED TO FULFILLING ITS PUBLIC MISSION. THE MAGNITUDE OF THE FISCAL CARNAGE COST AND TO BE COST BY COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS OF A STARK PROPORTIONS. HASTINGS VALUES THIS OF ITS AFFILIATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHILE HASTINGS DOES NOT BENEFIT FROM THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF OUR COMPATRIOTS IN CALIFORNIA SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION. WE WILL PERSEVERE TO MANAGE THROUGH THESE DIFFICULT TIMES AND LOOK FORWARD TO BETTER ONCE AHEAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. ALL RIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS RYAN STORE I AM THE ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR FOR BUDGET FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PROVIDE SEE ISSUES COMMENTS ON THE CSU OUTLOOK. AND EBAY REVISION. I'LL SPEAK TO A PROPOSED CUT IN A PROPOSED FISCAL FLEXIBILITY PROPOSAL THE REVISION. SO START OFF THOUGH AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR THIS YEAR SHE WAS ON VERY STRONG FOOTING- THE C. ISSUES FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATE FOR FIRST TIME STUDENTS INCREASED. TO TWENTY SEVEN POINT 5% UP FROM NINETEEN POINT GRADUATION ISSUE OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THREE GRADUATED- TOOTH- TWENTY THOUSAND MORE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS OR ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS- THAN JUST FIVE YEARS AGO. AND WE MADE PROGRESS IN ENSURING THAT OUR FACULTY AND STAFF WERE BEING. EIGHT FAIR AND COMPETITIVE WAGES. WELL OUR CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE CHANGED IN THE STATE IS NOW IN AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN WE CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON OUR MISSION. AND SERVING OUR STUDENTS AND CALIFORNIA AS BEST AS WE CAN. CERTAINLY WE UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION ECHO BED HAS USHERED IN A NEW FISCAL REALITY. AND VERY UNFORTUNATELY EIGHT LIKELY PROLONG STATE BUDGET CRISIS. TURNING TO THE PROPOSALS- THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IS A THREE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR ON GOING BUDGET REDUCTION. THAT IS A AS YOU'VE HEARD A 10% REDUCTION TO OUR GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION. A FOR PERSPECTIVE THAT IS THE QUILT AT THAT IS EQUIVALENT TO TWO TIMES ALL OF THE ON GOING MONEY DEDICATED SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN TO SEE ISSUES GRADUATION ISSUED OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. HI THIS POTENTIAL REDUCTION IS CLEARLY FORMIDABLE. MOREOVER THE ACTUAL IMPACT TO THE C. ISSUE BUDGET IS MORE SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE WE HAVE CLOSE TO ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS OF MORE COSTS IN THE BUDGET THAT ARE NOT FUNDED FOR THE FOR THE NEXT YEAR. OF THAT HUNDRED WE BELIEVE ABOUT FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS OF THIS IS FOR ON GOING MANDATORY COSTS FOR SUCH THINGS AS HEALTH CARE. AND PENSION RATE INCREASES. ADDITIONALLY THE OTHER 50% WE COULD EASILY SPEND ON. A ONE TIME CODE RELATED COSTS TO GET LIKE CLEANING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ADDITIONAL OVERTIME AND STAFF COSTS. THEREFORE WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION MINIMIZE THE REDUCTION TO OUR BASE OPERATIONS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. I WANT POSSIBLE PATH IS TO ADOPT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S ALTERNATIVE WHICH SWEEPS UNSPENT CURRENT YOUR MONEY'S AND LESSONS THE REDUCTION BY THE SAME ABOUT IN THE BUDGET YEAR. WELL THE MAGNITUDE OF THE POTENTIAL CUT TO THE C. ISSUE IS DAUNTING. WE LEARNED FROM THE GREAT RECESSION AND HAVE A NUMBER OF TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT ON OUR STUDENTS. FACULTY AND ON OUR STAFF. THE CSU IS PRUDENTLY GROWN RESERVES TO MEET CERTAIN STRATEGIC GOALS. ONE OF WHICH IS SPENT PREPARATION FOR POSSIBLE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. THIS ISSUE HAS DRAWN UPON THESE RESERVES TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONS AND PROGRAMS IMPACTED BY COBIT NINETEEN. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. CLEARLY THE USE OF RESERVES WHICH ARE ONE TIME FUNDS CANNOT BE A SOLUTION. BUT THEY ARE A VALUABLE ASSET THEY COULD BE UTILIZED UNTIL SUCH TIME AS OTHER RESOURCES BECOME AVAILABLE. OUR CAMPUSES ARE ALL HAVE RECEIVED FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL CARES ACT. WHICH TO MITIGATE SOME OF THE COSTS OF REVENUE LOSSES DUE TO A COVERT NINETEEN. AND I LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT WE DID AN ANALYSIS OF COSTS. TO DATE THROUGH THE SPRING TERM AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE COMBINED. COST BECAUSE A CO BID AND REVENUE LOSSES RELATED TO- SUCH THINGS AS HAVING TO CLOSE OUR STUDENT HOUSING EARLY HAVING EMPTY PARKING LOTS. THE GRAND TOTAL IMPACT IS APPROXIMATE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. IN APRIL OF THIS ISSUE IMPLEMENTED A HIRING CHILL. AND REDUCED NONESSENTIAL TRAVEL- BOTH OF WHICH WILL SAVE MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR THE UNIVERSITY. SO WITH ALL THESE TOOLS IN MIND WE ASK THAT THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDE THE CSU MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY. IS BEING ABLE TO OPERATIONALIZE THE pSUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S REVISION PROPOSAL THAT WOULD ALLOW THE SYSTEM TO USE RESTRICTED SEE ISSUE FUNDS CROSS UNIVERSITY. TO ADDRESS A CUTE COBIT RELATED IMPACTS AND REVENUE LOSSES. WE NEED FLEXIBILITY AS WE ENTER THESE TOUGH FINANCIAL TIMES. AND THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ENSURE THAT IF NEEDED WE WILL HAVE THE FINAL TOOL NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE. WE ARE ABLE TO MITIGATE- IMPACTS TO STUDENTS TO OUR FACULTY AND STAFF. PLEASE BUDGET HEARINGS AT DO NOT DIVERT AND MANY OF OUR SELF FUNDED STUDENT SERVICES. THAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR STUDENTS COLLEGE EXPERIENCE THOSE ARE THINGS LIKE STUDENTS CENTERS WHERE STUDENTS CONGREGATE STUDY HOST MEETINGS AND LISTEN TO GUEST SPEAKERS. IT'S ALSO INCLUDES STUDENT HOUSING AND DINING SO STUDENTS CAN LIVE ON CAMPUS WHICH IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE FOR OUR CAMPUSES ARE LOCATED IN AREAS. THAT HAVE LIMITED STUDENT HOUSING CAPACITY. A PARKING PROGRAMS. ARE ALSO PART OF THIS CATEGORY THOSE ARE TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS LIVE OFF CAMPUS AND NEED A CAR TO ENSURE THEY CAN GET TO THE CLASSES. AND THEIR JOBS AND HAVE A PLACE TO PARK. INSTANT HEALTH CENTERS WHERE STUDENTS ARE GUARANTEED A LEAST MINIMUM ACCESS TO BASIC HEALTH SERVICES ESPECIALLY FOR OUR STUDENTS WHO LACK HEALTH INSURANCE. SO THESE ARE A CRITICAL FUNCTIONS THAT WERE CREATED BY STATE LAW MANY YEARS AGO IN RECOGNITION OF THE NECESSARY SUPPORT THEY PROVIDE TO STUDENTS. THESE SELF FUNDED PROGRAMS DO NOT RECEIVE GENERAL FUND SPORT INSTEAD THEY ARE SUPPORTED BY STATE FEES. BUT DO TO COPE IN NINETEEN LARGELY EMPTING OUR CAMPUSES. THESE SELF FUNDED- STUDENT SERVICES HAVE EXPERIENCED THEIR OWN FISCAL CRISES. ADMINISTRATION IS DOING THE RIGHT THING BY PROPOSING THAT FUNDS COULD BE TRANSFERRED BETWEEN THESE FUNCTIONS TO ENSURE THAT THEY REMAIN SOLVENT. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE USING THIS TOOL IMMEDIATELY BUT IT IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN CASE IT BECOMES NECESSARY IN THE COMING YEARS. AS WE LOOK TO THE FALL AND THE FUTURE HANDFUL OF ITEMS- YOU SHOULD KEEP IN MIND. FIRST THE CHANCELLOR- RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THAT ARE PLANNING APPROACH WILL RESULT IN CC COURSES PRIMARILY BEING DELIVERED VIRTUALLY. FOR THE FALL TWENTY TWENTY TERM. WHAT WHAT WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS FOR IN PERSON ACTIVITIES THAT CANNOT BE DELIVERED VIRTUALLY. THERE WILL BE HYBRID APPROACHES AND THERE WILL BE VERY ABILITY ACROSS THE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES DUE TO SPECIFIC CONTEXT AND CIRCUMSTANCES. A PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS PREDICT WAVES OF INFECTIONS IN LATE FALL TWENTY TWENTY AND EARLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IF YOU WERE IN. IN A FACE TO FACE MODALITY WE WOULD LIKELY HAVE TO SWITCH TO A VIRTUAL FORMAT. AND THAT WOULD COMPROMISE RIGOROUS STANDARDS IN SAFETY AS WELL AS WELFARE. SECOND FOR THE FUTURE AS I NOTED EARLIER THE UNIVERSITY IS MORE THAN JUST ACADEMIC AND STUDENT SUPPORTS INCLUDE STATE SIDE STOOD SPORTS LIKE HEALTH CENTERS. HOUSING PARKING STUDENTS CENTERS- UP. TO SOMEBODY'S PROGRAM AREAS ARE UNCHARACTERISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT FISCAL DISTRESS- BECAUSE STUDENTS EMPLOYEES OF THE PUBLIC ARE LARGELY ABSENT FROM THE CAMPUSES. IN THESE CHALLENGES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OTHER AREAS OF THE UNIVERSITY THAT HASN'T HAPPENED YET- BUT WE ARE WORKING TO AVOID THAT. BUT WE BUT BE AWARE THAT IT COULD BECOME A SERIOUS CHALLENGES FUTURE. THIRD OF PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATIONHAS TO BE A PRIORITY IN THE STATE NOW INTO THE FUTURE. REMEMBER THE SEA ISSUE IS THE LARGEST FOUR YEAR PUBLIC UNIVERSITY IN THE COUNTRY. AND HALF OF ALL THE DEGREES OF THIS STATE. NEED TO KEEP AT THAT ALL THE NEW DEGREES THE STATE NEEDS TO KEEP THE STATE MOVING FORWARD ORIGINATE OUT OF THE SEA ISSUE. ARE THOSE YOUR FUTURE TEACHERS HERE NURSES YOUR SITE TEST YOUR AGRICULTURAL EXPERTS ALL THAT WE RELIED VERY HEAVILY THESE DAYS. FOURTH AND FINALLY- WE WILL CONTINUE TO FULFILL OUR MISSION TO CALIFORNIA. WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE A BEACON OF OPPORTUNITY. SOCIAL MOBILITY IN THE GOOD TIMES AND NOT SO GOOD TIMES- THAT ARE AMONG US APART US TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NOW. ARE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE REPRESENTED. THANK YOU CHAIR MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE MY NAME IS THOSE THAT NEVER AT BY SINCE RECALLS FINANCE AND FACILITIES PLANNING- AND I BEGIN BY SAYING THAT I'VE NEVER BEEN PROUDER TO WORK IN REPRESENT WITH CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES I'M AS EVIDENCED BY THEIR EFFORTS IN THE RESPONSE TO COPE IN NINETEEN AND THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE COMMUNITIES HAVE FACE. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A TOUGH BUDGET THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU WANTED TO DELIVER TO OUR TWO POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS BUT IN THE LESS- AT STATE LEADERS- AS YOU PLAN AND SET PASSED TO THE RECOVERY FROM KOBE NINETEEN WE ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER AND PRIORITIZE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. AND RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANT ROLE THAT WE PLAYED ALREADY AND WILL CONTINUE TO AND THE RESPONSE AND THE PIVOTAL ROLE THAT WE WILL HAVE IN CALIFORNIA'S RECOVERY. TEN YEARS AGO CUTS THE CALIFORNIA IN COLLEGE TRAINS. INTO DRASTIC DECLINE IN ACCESS CUTTING UPWARDS OF SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS FROM HIGHER EDUCATION MANY OF WHOM NEVER CAME BACK. THAT TRANSLATED DIRECTLY INTO HIS STORE STATES WORK FORCE AND WIDE IN THE CALIFORNIA'S DEGREE GAP. HUH THE GREATEST RISK THAT WE NOW FACE IS THAT THESE CUTS WILL. WILL LIMIT OUR PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE TOWARDS EQUITABLE SUCCESS IN SOME OF THE GOALS OUTLINED IN THE VISION FOR SUCCESS WE CANNOT ALLOW HISTORY TO REPEAT ITSELF AND MUST RECOGNIZE THAT THESE CUTS WILL NOT BE INCONSEQUENTIAL. AT THE LOWEST FUNDED HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM THE LARGEST AND THE AND THE NATION YET MOST CONSEQUENTIAL FOR EQUITY IN ACCESS WE ARE CONCERNED THAT DEEP CUTS WILL EVENTUALLY REACH A BREAKING POINT. SO IN THESE CHALLENGING TIMES WE ASK FOR FLEXIBILITY TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT ON OUR COLLEGES AND THE STUDENTS THAT THEY SERVE. BEFORE I ADDRESSED THE PROPOSAL SPECIFICS- I WANT TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT AND CALIFORNIA COMEY COLLEGES RESPONSE. THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGES HAVE- AND CONTINUE TO TRAIN- CALIFORNIA'S FIRST RESPONDERS TRAINING AND EDUCATING TWO HUNDRED OR- TWENTY THOUSAND FIRST RESPONDERS AND HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS EVERY YEAR. TO ASSIST THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE IN CULVER NINETEEN WITH DONATED AND PROVIDED HUNDRED AND FORTY VENTILATORS AND OUR- CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE PROGRAMS HAVE GOTTEN TO WORK MANY OF THEM HAVE DONATED THOUSANDS OF PIECES OF PROTECTIVE PERSONAL EQUIPMENT TO LOCAL HOSPITALS AND CLINICS. AND ADVANCED MANUFACTURING PROGRAMS HAVE CREATED FACE SHIELDS USING THREE D. PRINTERS TO FULFILL THE NEEDS AT LOCAL HOSPITALS. OUR CAREER PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO TRAIN THE CRITICAL INDUSTRY AND INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS THAT HAVE BEEN OUTLINED BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND WE FACE MANY CHALLENGES AS WE MOVE FORWARD OUR OVERALL COPING NINETEEN RELATED COSTS HAVE INCREASED BY TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY THEY ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. KERR'S ACT UNFORTUNATELY WILL NOT BE ENOUGH EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND OF OUR STUDENTS WERE ARBITRATOR ARBITRARILY EXCLUDED FROM KERRY'S ACT BASED ON THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DEFINITION OF WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR EMERGENCY GRANTS. AND WHILE WE'RE SUPPORTING OUR COLLEGES AND EVERYTHING WE CAN FOR FREE MY REIMBURSEMENT NONETHELESS OUR COSTS WILL INCREASE AND WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT STUDENT PROGRAMS. AND SO THEN WE TURN TO YOU- AS A PARTNER IN RECOVERY AND TO REMIND YOU THAT OUR PROGRAMS PROVIDE THE LARGEST WORKFORCE TRAINING IN THE NATION. WE ARE THE BACKBONE OF CALIFORNIANS WORKFORCE ARE NIMBLE PROGRAMS- AND SURE THAT WE CAN BE ADAPTED TO THE FUTURE WORK FORCE AND ANY EMERGING- A CONDOM USE THAT ARE BOTH REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE. WE ALSO PROVIDE A PATH TO RE ENTRY TO ANYONE AS OPEN ACCESS AND WE WILL DO WHAT WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN PRESERVE ACCESS AND- PROTECT STUDENTS FROM FALLING PREY TO FOR PROFITS THAT WOULD WILL. I'M TO THEM IN THEIR TIME OF HONOR ABILITY. SO LET ME SHARE ABOUT THE PROBE THE PROPOSAL SPECIFIC TO THE MAY REVISION. I WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR EMPHASIZING COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION AND X. BUT I DEVELOPMENT OF SHORT TERM CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS THESE WILL HELP US PUT CALIFORNIANS TO WORK AND ENSURE THAT OUR PROGRAMS AGAIN ARE ALIGNED WITH CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC NEEDS. WE THANK FOR A WE THANK THE ADMINISTRATION OF FOR INCLUDING FLEXIBILITY FOR COSTS RELATED TO COPE IN NINETEEN OUTSIDE OF THE 50% LAW. AND WE SUPPORT- THE SENTIMENT TO MAINTAIN ACCESS BUT AGAIN ASKED THAT YOU RECOGNIZE THAT THESE CUTS WILL BE CONSEQUENTIAL. I THEIR SYSTEM SUPPORT PROGRAM THAT WILL PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED ALIGNMENT GREATER COORDINATION ELIMINATION OF SILOS AND PROVIDE ESSENTIAL AND MUCH NEEDED TRANSPARENCY OF STATUTORY SET ASIDES SO WE THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING THAT AS WELL. AND THEN WE APPRECIATE RE PURPOSING OF BY DOWNS FOR PENSION LIABILITY SO THAT WE CAN REDUCE DISTRICTS EMPLOYER COSTS BY 2% THAT WILL FURTHER ELIMINATE- MORE CUTS TO PROGRAMS. LASTLY THEY AT. THE CAPITAL OUTLAY PROGRAMS THAT WERE ICLUDED BE APPRECIATIVE OF THOSE SINCE THEY WILL KEEP CALIFORNIANS WORKING. NOW WHEN WE DISCUSS SOME OF THE AREAS THAT ARE DEEPLY CONCERNING- FOR THE- ME BEGIN BY SHARING THAT THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS CUTS THAT ARE PROPOSED- BOTH IN I. IN DEFERRALS APPORTIONMENT CUTS AND- AND IN LOST REVENUE EQUATE TO ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FOR COMPARISON THAT'S EQUIVALENT IN OF THE CUTS THAT WE RECEIVED IN THE FIVE YEARS OF THE GREAT RECESSION ALL ABSORBED IN ONE YEAR. REDUCTIONS TO STRONG WORK FORCE LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO KEEP CALIFORNIANS WORKING AND RE EMPLOYEE AND RE ENGAGE THOSE THAT LOSE THEIR JOBS DURING. THIS TRAGIC TIME AND THEN THE CUTS TO STUDENT EQUITY AND ACHIEVEMENT PROGRAM ARE DISHEARTENING GIVEN THE FACT HE'S BEEN THE CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE COLLEGES HAVE TURN TO. WHEN OTHER SOURCES OF RESOURCES WERE NOT AVAILABLE TO HELP THE DIRECT NEEDS OF STUDENTS. INSTEAD WE WANT TO PROVIDE SOME SUGGESTIONS AND OTHER APPROACHES THAT CAN BE TAKEN. FOR EXAMPLE WE WOULD AT ADVICE OR RECOMMEND CONSIDERING AND REVISITING THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM LOCAL AND REGIONAL SPLIT TO ENABLE MORE RESOURCES TO REMAIN WITH LOCAL PROGRAMS BUT STILL ALLOWING REGIONS TO PLAN- AND SERVE THEIR ECONOMIES. WE ASK THAT YOU WORK WITH US TO IDENTIFY NEEDED FLEXIBILITY EASE IN AREAS SUCH AS LOTTERY FUNDS AND OTHER- SOURCES THAT CAN MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THESE CUTS ON OUR STUDENTS. AND WHILE NOT CONVENTIONAL BUT STILL ALLOWED. WE ASK THAT YOU DIRECT NON PROP NINETY RESOURCES TO OUR COLLEGES- TO PREVENT FURTHER LEARNING LOSS AND FUTURE WORKFORCE LOSSES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH YOU TO GET MORE FEDERAL RESOURCES TO CALIFORNIA AND WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL. RECOGNIZE OUR EFFORTS IN THE RESPONSE AND RECOVERY THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU LESLIE WE HAVE A REPRESENT HIM FOR THEM WE HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THAT CALIFORNIA'S TO NEED COMMISSION. THANK YOU CHAIR MCCARTY AND MEMBERS FOR INVITING THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S HEARING. MY NAME IS JULIA BLAIR I'M AND TERM DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS FOR THE COMMISSION. THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS CREATED GREAT UNCERTAINTY FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS ESPECIALLY IF THEY MAKE PLANS FOR THE UPCOMING ACADEMIC YEAR. STUDENTS ARE REELING FROM THE MERRY OUT OF CHALLENGES BECAUSE BY THIS CRISIS INCLUDING HOW THEY WILL PAY FOR COLLEGE. LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHO ALREADY STRUGGLE TO PAY FOR COLLEGE ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO DROPPING OUT BECAUSE OF JOB LOSS AND FINANCIAL INSTABILITY. THE STUDENT EIGHT COMMISSION WHICH ADMINISTERS THE STATE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS IS COMMITTED TO SERVING OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS IN THE WAKE OF COVERT NINETEEN. AND THROUGHOUT THE ECONOMIC CRISIS. WE BELIEVE THAT FINANCIAL AID HELPS KEEP STUDENTS IN COLLEGE AT A TIME WHEN OUR STATE ECONOMIC RECOVERY WILL DEPEND ON INCREASINGTHE NUMBER OF COLLEGE GRADUATES IN CALIFORNIA. TO ASSIST OUR STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THIS CRISIS THE COMMISSION IS EXPANDING ITS COMMUNICATIONS AND OUTREACH TO CURRENT AND PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS. TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THAT FINANCIAL AID THE PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR TUITION AND BASIC NEEDS IT'S STILL AVAILABLE TO THEM. MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO REACH OUT TO TRANSFER STUDENTS WHO STILL HAVEN'T TOLD SEPTEMBER SECOND TO APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID. WE ARE USING EMAIL WEB IN OUR SOCIAL MEDIA AND OUR WEBSITE. TO ENSURE STUDENTS HAVE UP TO DATE INFORMATION ON FINANCIAL AID. ADDITIONALLY WE ARE COLLABORATING WITH OUR INSTITUTIONAL PARTNERS TO RESPOND QUICKLY TO AN ANTICIPATED UP TECH IN FINANCIAL AID APPEALS BY STUDENTS TO ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE SUDDENLY CHANGED AS A RESULT OF COVERT NINETEEN CLOSURES AND LAYOFFS. JUST TWO MONTHS AGO WE WERE POISED TO MOVE FORWARD IN PURSUING CAL GRANT MODERNIZATION WHEN COLBERT NINETEEN CHANGE THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT. THE COMMISSION QUICKLY PIVOTED AND BEGAN FOCUSING ON SUPPORTING STUDENTS MUST IMMEDIATE AND BASIC NEEDS. WELL COVERED NINETEEN HAVE PUT A PAUSE ON CAL GRANT MODERNIZATION EFFORTS WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO IMPLEMENTING THE STRUCTURAL POLICY FRAMEWORK EVEN WITHOUT NEW FUNDING AS SOON AS REASONABLY POSSIBLE. WITH WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK OUR LEGISLATIVE PARTNERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER KEVIN MCCARTY JOSE MEDINA AND SENATOR CONNIE LEIVA AND MANY OTHERS FOR SUPPORTING THESE MODERNIZATION EFFORTS TO MORE EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS STUDENT NEEDS. REGARDING THE GOVERNOR'S NAY REVISED PROPOSAL I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO START OUT BY SAYING THAT THE COMMISSION APPRECIATES THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENT TO MAINTAINING STRONG FINANCIAL AID INVESTMENTS ADMIT THE CODED NINETEEN CRISIS. CALIFORNIA'S LANDMARK FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM WAS LARGELY PRESERVED IN THE GOVERNOR'S NEWLY REVISED. FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE PROPOSES TO MAINTAIN THE CAL GRANT SUPPLEMENT FOR STUDENTS WITH DEPENDENTS THAT WAS APPROVED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. ENSURING THAT STUDENT PARENTS WITH FINANCIAL NEED CONTINUE TO RECEIVE UP TO SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SUPPORT OF PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. FURTHERMORE THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE DOES NOT PROPOSE ANY CHANGES TO THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAM. MEANING THAT THE CONTEST COMMISSION WILL CONTINUE TO ISSUE FORTY ONE THOUSAND NEW COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT AWARDS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ACADEMIC YEAR. THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVIVE ALSO PROPOSES TO FULLY FUND THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM ENSURING THAT MIDDLE INCOME STUDENTS CAN CONTINUE TO ACCESS FINANCIAL AID RESOURCES DURING THE ENSUING RECESSION. THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE INCLUDE THE REDUCTION TO THE MAXIMUM CAL GRANT AWARD FOR NEW RECIPIENTS ATTENDING PRIVATE NONPROFIT INSTITUTION FROM NINE THOUSAND EIGHTY FOUR DOLLARS TO EIGHT THOUSAND FIFTY SIX DOLLARS CONSISTENT WITH ENACTED STATUTE REGARDING TRANSFERRED MISSION. THE COMMISSION CONTINUES TO SUPPORT MAINTAINING AND STRENGTHENING CAL GRANT AID FOR ALL STUDENTS WITH NEEDS. I HAVE THE COMMISSION ALSO APPRECIATE SO THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION INCLUDE SUPPORT FOR KEY NEW PROGRAMS INCLUDING SUPPORT FOR THE GRANT DELIVERY SYSTEM MODERNIZATION. GDF THEM PROJECT. THE DREAMER SERVICE INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM AND COMPLIACE WITH THE NATIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION ACT. THE FUNDING PROPOSAL FOR GSM ENSURES THAT THE COMMISSION WILL COMPLETE THE FINAL PHASE OF THE PROJECT THUS FAR ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS HAS ALREADY BEEN INVESTED IN THIS EFFORT. FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF GDS THEM WHILE. GREATLY IMPROVE THE COMMISSION'S ABILITY TO SERVE THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS. OF STUDENTS APPLYING FOR FINANCIAL AID I MAKE A EASIER FOR. TO RELIABLY ACCESS WEB GRANTS FOR STUDENTS FROM ANY DEVICE. I'M MORE QUICKLY NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM. STREAMLINED COMPLEX PROCESSES FOR WORKING WITH INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING YEAR AND RECONCILIATION THAT'S ALLOWING FINANCIAL AID OFFICES MORE TIME TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH STUDENTS. AND ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO ACCOMMODATE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES IMPROVEMENTS AND NEW PROGRAMS MORE EFFICIENTLY. JDS I'M FUNDING WILL ALSO ALLOW US TO PHASE OUT OUR OLD LEGACY SYSTEM STATING SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT STAFF TIME AND RESOURCES. WITHOUT THE PROPOSED FIVE POINT THREE MILLION IN GDS THEM FUNDING THE COMMISSION WOULD BE FORCED TO MAINTAIN BOTH OUR LEGACY RANT DELIVERY SYSTEM AND THE NEW GSM SYSTEM WE ARE BUILDING. THIS IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE SOME OF OUR PROGRAMS HAVE ALREADY BEEN BUILT ON THE NEW SYSTEM NAMELY OUR WEB GRANT FOR STUDENTS INTERFACE AND OTHER PARTS ARE STILL BEING MAINTAINED BY THE LEGACY SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE INSTITUTIONS INTERFACE THAT'S REQUIRING SIX ACT TO MAINTAIN TWO SYSTEMS AND CREATING DOUBLE THE WORK LOAD. THE COMMISSION ALSO NOTES THE REDUCTIONS IN FUNDING FOR THE NEW GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM. AND WITH A NEW CHILD SAVINGS ACCOUNT GRANT PROGRAM PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR MAY REVISION. PENDING THE OUTCOME OF THE FINAL TWENTY TWENTY ONE STATE BUDGET THE COMMISSION WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE NO NEW PROGRAMS. TO ENSURE THE REMAINING FUNDING IS ADMINISTERED TO ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. SO TO RICK WRAP UP MY REMARKS STUDENTS WERE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO COVER THE COST OF FOOD. HOUSING TRANSPORTATION AND CHILDCARE PRIOR TO THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. AND INEQUITIES IN COLLEGE ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY WILL ONLY BE EXACERBATED BY COVERED NINETEEN. IT IS MORE CRITICAL. THAN EVER THAT CALIFORNIA PRIORITIZE FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR STUDENTS. THE COMMISSION UP WHAT'S THE STRONG COMMITMENT TO COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY DEMONSTRATED BY THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU. STUDENTS ADVOCATES EMMA STAKEHOLDERS TO MAXIMIZE MY ITS FINANCIAL AID RESOURCES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS STUDENTS. THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY. OKAY. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATIONS I KNOW- WE USUALLY HEAR ONE- SEGMENT AT A TIME AND GET TO CURE NAY BUT WE'RE GONNA DO THESE ALL TOGETHER THIS IS A CERTAINLY A UNIQUE TIME WITH OUR PROPOSALS HERE FOR THE MAY REVISE. I HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS BUT YOU KNOW ALL START BY OPENING UP TO. COMMITTEE MEMBERS SO. YOU WERE THE FIRST ONE I SAW MAKE A MOVE MISTER GALLAGHER SO. YOU GO. WELL ALL STAR HERE AND HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS AND MAYBE ON THIS BUT OTHERS ASSN WE COME BACK. I THINK THE FIRST YEAR TO CS YOU. I KNOW YOU GUYS CAME OUT HERE LAST WEEK SAYING THAT YOU WERE GOING TO YOU KNOW MAKE A DECISION TO MOVE TO ONLINE FOR NEXT FALL ACROSS THE BOARD- YOU KNOW IT'S- OBVIOUSLY SOMEWHAT OF A CONCERN AND THAT. YOUR MANY OF THESE CAMPUSES POTENTIALLY COULD BE RE OPENED IN THE FALL WITH SAFETY PROTOCOLS AND YOU KNOW AND WHAT THESE CAMPUSES MEAN CERTAINLY'S COMMUNITIES OTHERS GIVE EXAMPLE OF CSU CHICO- THAT REPRESENT TO YOU KNOW. OBVIOUSLY BIG FOR THE COMMUNITY THE STUDENTS. BEING THERE AND- EVERYTHING THAT THAT THAT COMES WITH A COLLEGE TOWN- BUT THIS IS REALLY SERVING THE ENTIRE STATE YES CSU CHICO. TWENTY POINT 5% COME FROM THE SACRAMENTO AREA THE STUDENTS. TWENTY POINT 5% COME FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. TWENTY TWO POINT 1% COME FROM THE LOS ANGELES AREA. AND SIXTEEN POINT CALIFORNIA AND- INTERESTING FACT ONLY TWO POINT 5% OF THE STUDENTS ARE OUT OF STATE. FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS ARE CSU CERTAINLY. SERVING CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT YOU KNOW ONLINE. COURSES ARE JUST NOT THE SAME AS WHAT YOU GET IN CLASS WITH THE IN PERSON. TIMES ON I MEAN LOOK I KNOW THERE'S A LOT THERE'S A LOT. OF CONCERN AND BUT THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF TIME BETWEEN NOW AND THE FALL. I MEAN IS CSU POSSIBLY CONSIDERING MAYBE DOING THIS DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THE ON A CAMPUS OR IS THAT IS THE ALL ONLINE COURSES ACROSS THE BOARD IS THAT KIND OF A FINAL DECISION. AT THIS POINT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. IT'S A ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER THE FIRST ELEMENT THAT WAS. DETERMINED WAS WHAT IS THE BEST- BEST THING MOVING FORWARD FOR OUR STUDENTS. LOTS AND LOTS OF CONSULTATION INTERNALLY WITHIN THE C. ISSUE- AMONG THE PRESIDENTS OF EACH THESE CAMPUSES AND THE SENIOR LEADERSHIP OF THE- OF THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. I THINK ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT SOMETIMES HEADLINES IN NEWSPAPERS ARE MISLEADING AND SOMETIMES INFORMATION GETS TWEAKED A LITTLE BIT INCORRECTLY WHEN- I'M FAMILIAR WITH THAT YEAH UP WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE PLANNING FOR A VIRTUAL DELIVERY FOR THE FALL AND FOR THE WINTER. AND THE IDEA HERE IS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO BE THE MOST EQUIPPED AND BEST EQUIPPED TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER THE BEST INSTRUCTION WE CAN'T POSSIBLY. ONE OF THOSE WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WITH OUR STUDENTS IS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ADDITIONAL PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT MORE THAN WE ALREADY HAVE. TO OFFER FACULTY TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER EVEN A BETTER INSTRUCTIONAL OF ANALOGY. IN THIS IN THIS TOUGH SITUATION. SO I THINK WHAT THIS DOES IS IT ALLOWS FOR US TO BE NIMBLE GOING FORWARD THE CHALLENGES THAT CHANCE ARE MENTIONED AT A RECENT BOARD MEETING IS IF WE DECIDED TO GO IN PERSON. YEAH I KNOW THAT'S IDEAL THE WHAT EVERYBODY WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT'S OUR GREATEST A WHILE THE STREAM TO BE BACK- NOT TALKING TO PEOPLE WITH MASKS AND THAT SORT OF THING. IF WE GO IN PERSON AND THEN ABRUPTLY HAVE TO DO WHAT WE DID IN MARCH IT IS INCREDIBLY DISRUPTIVE TO ALL ELEMENTS OF. COMMUNITIES AND ESPECIALLY THE STUDENTS. AND FACULTY IN OUR STATE THAT HAVE TO DO WOULD HAVE TO REPEAT THIS AGAIN. BUT THERE A COUPLE BUT INSTEAD TO THINK THROUGH TO HERE THIS IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH SO THE ARTICLE HEADLINES THAT WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT- ARE SAYING THAT YOU KNOW SEE ISSUE GOING ALL ONLINE. AND THAT MIGHT BE THE PERIOD BEHIND IT. OVER PLANNING FOR PLANNING THAT DIRECTION BUT THEY'RE GONNA BE INSTANCES WHERE THAT'S NOT PRACTICAL NURSING STUDENTS WHO HAVE THAT PRACTICAL RIGHT. THERE ARE GONNA BE AGRICULTURAL STUDENTS WHO HAVE TO BE IN THE FIELDS AND LEARNING HOW THAT TRACTOROPERATES AND HOW TO. DO SOIL SAMPLE. SORTS OF OUR TO BE A OF HIS BY K. REVIEW. THE CHAIR OFFICE. PROVIDED EXEMPTION. SO THAT IN THOSE INSTANCES WHERE. ENGINEERING STUDENTS NEED TO DO THEIR CAPSTONE AND IT IS A PHYSICAL EXPERIENCE. THAT THERE WILL BE AN APPROPRIATE WAIVER WHERE JUSTIFIED. AND SECONDLY. THAT THERE IS A APPROPRIATE PP AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. THE OTHER FACTOR TO OF COURSE BUT TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES SPREAD ACROSS TO EIGHT HUNDRED NINE HUNDRED MILES OF THIS. GREAT STATE OF OURS- UP WHERE YOU HAVE I ONLY DID IT AS SITUATIONS LOCALLY. WHAT'S GOING ON L. LATE IN IN THE LA BASIN IT. THE MID NINETEEN IT'S GOING TO BE GROSSLY DIFFERENT THAN THAN YOUR BELOVED CHICO STATE. SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE NOT SEEING A PLAN TO PLAN FOR. IN THOSE INSTANCES WHERE WE CAN GO PHYSICAL WE CAN AND WHERE IT'S APPROPRIATE BUT- BUT I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING OUR GOAL IS TO ALWAYS KEEP THE STUDENTS IN IN MIND FIRST. WE WOULD ALL LOVE TO DO FACE TO FACE WE WOULD ALL LOVE TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY AGAIN. BUT BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT SITUATION WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL. SAFETY PERSPECTIVE AND IN. APPROPRIATE SO THAT STUDENTS ARE ACHIEVING THE BEST LEARNING OUTCOMES POSSIBLE AND NOT HAVING AGAIN TO REPEAT. POTENTIALLY OF WHERE IT'S INCREDIBLY DISRUPTIVE AT SOME VARIOUS IN CRITICAL POINTS I MEAN. ONE OF THE WHEN THE FORECAST FOR LATE FALL THAT COULD BE A PERFECT STORM RIGHT BEFORE- A FINALS WHERE DUDLEY YOUR YOUR WORK ALL SEMESTER OR ALL QUARTER. TO A GRINDING HALT SO WE WANT TO BE AS AS PREPARED AS POSSIBLE. GIVE US MUCH OP. STILL TO BE ABLE TO DO NOT ONLY GET THEIR DEGREES TO ACT. I WOULD THINK THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER AND THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR KIND OF MORE THE DETAILS OF HOW THAT THAT IS GOING TO BE. WORKING OUT. THE KIND OF SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY'S HEARING I WANT TO DELVE INTO THIS ISSUE OF YOU KNOW. IN THE REVISE THE GOVERNOR IS SAYING. LOOK WE ARE GOING TO- HAVE SOME PRETTY DRASTIC CUTS REALLY BASICALLY A OF OUR HIGHER EDUCATION. AN INSANE BUT WILL TRIGGER THOSE OFF. IF WE GET SUFFICIENT FEDERAL FUNDS WELL THE REALITY IS WE DID GET FEDERAL FUNDS- FOR OUR HIGHER EDUCATION IN FACT- THE CARES ACT THE FIRST ONE- CAME THROUGH WITH ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IS ULTIMATELY WHAT I COME THROUGH FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE MILLION FOR A COMMUNITY COLLEGES. HAVE INTERNED FIVE MILLION FOR SEAT YOU AND TURN SIXTY MILLION FOR YOU SEE. HALF OF THOSE FUNDS BEING CREATED FOR FINANCIAL AID. SO GET MY QUESTION BECOMES WHY DON'T WE TRIGGER THAT OFF RIGHT NOW- SOON BE AS THOUGH WE DID GET FEDERAL FUNDS THE FED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. HAS IN FACT COME THROUGH. WITH SUPPORTS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. AND SO CONSIDERING THAT FACT MAYBE WE SHOULD START TRIGGERING OFF THESE CUTS. RIGHT NOW OMIT DOESN'T PULL OUT A SENSE TO BE PULLING BACK STATE AID- IN SUPPORT AND INCLUDING. FINANCIAL AID I MEAN WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT AS WELL- BUT I QUESTION TO DO LAUGH- WHOEVER WANTS TO ANSWER THIS WOULD BE. YOU KNOW WHY IT WHY NOT TRIGGER OFF SOME OF THOSE CUTS. RIGHT NOW CONSIDERING THAT WE HAVE SEAT RECEIVED SUBSTANTIAL. FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE STATE. YEAH IN A FINANCE I THINK- WHAT WE WOULD SAY TO THAT IS THAT THESE RESOURCES CAN ASSIST OUR UNIVERSITIES ARE IN- MITIGATING THE IMPACTS OF THE PROPOSED REDUCTIONS BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEY ARE A DIGITAL COSTS AS WELL AS HELPING STE A I. A MAIN DISH EARNING. THOSE RESOURCES ARE TO THE IN COVERING THE COSTS- ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPOSED- REDUCTIONS RIGHT BUT THEY STEPPED UP SO WHERE WE BACKING OFF. I THINK FROM FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. WE HAVE ALSO WE ARE AWARE THAT THE UNIVERSITIES HAVE ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A CODE NINETEEN ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO MITIGATING THE IMPACTS TO OUR MOST UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENT POPULATIONS. WHY I STILL DON'T HEAR MUCH OF AN ANSWER THERE BUT LOOK AT I MEAN FOR ME AND FROM MY STANDPOINT HE WAS THE THIS ROOM RECOGNIZE HOW IMPORTANT ARE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS ARE- ANY OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES ALTHOUGH KENYA. TO THE CS USED TO THE UC'S. NO AS I JUST TALKED ABOUT CHICO STATE SERVING STUDENTS THROUGHOUT. THE STATE AND THAT IS AND THAT IS THE CASE IN ALL OF OUR UNIVERSITIES A BY CRITICAL. OPPORTUNITIES AND WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET TO A PLACE. WHAT WE HELP ENSURE THAT. ADEQUATE FUNDING. FOR HIGHER EDUCATION LOOK WE ALL RECOGNIZE. OF COURSE THAT WE'RE IN A VERY DIRE SITUATION YOU KNOW HUGE REVENUE SHORTFALL. AS A RESULT OF COVERT NINETEEN BUT IT'S IN THE TOUGH BUDGET TIMES THAT EVEN MORE SO BUDGET SEEM TO BE ABOUT PRIORITIES. AND CERTAINLY ARE HIGHER EDUCATION EVERYTHING THAT THEY PROVIDE- SHOULD BE A PRIORITY IN THIS AND ESPECIALLY WHEN WE ARE IN FACT TO GET FEDERAL SUPPORT. OUR EDUCATION- HIGHER EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. YELP YEAH I THINK IT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE- MAKE THE COMMITMENT STATE LEVEL TO KEEP TRYING KEEP THAT STABLE AS WELL SO. I THINK WE SHOULD BE REALLY LOOKING AT THAT SIR JUST DOING A 10% ACROSS THE BOARD CUT LET'S TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE- THE FEDERAL SUPPORT THAT WE HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED. AND REALLY LOOK CAN WE KIND OF KEEP THESE THINGS AS AS STABLE AS POSSIBLE- MAYBE JUST TWO MORE QUICK QUESTIONS ONE. IN THE FINANCIAL AID PORTION. IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE CUTTING I THINK IT'S UNIVERSITIES. AND SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS WHY THE INEQUITY THERE WERE FOCUSING REALLY AND SEEMS LIKE REALLY TARGETED FINANCIAL AID CUTS TO THE PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES. YOU KNOW OUR STUDENTS ARE GETTING EDUCATION THERE AS WELL THERE EVERY EVERY BIT AS DESERVING OF HELP AND SUPPORT AND THEIR EDUCATION WHY ARE WE PICKING ON THE. HI I LIKE TRAVIS WITH THE PAYMENT. FINANCE THEY'RE JUST MINUTES SIMPLY AND I JUST WANT TO ADDRESS CURRENT LAW. I'M BETTING QUITE HERE YET COULD YOU SAY THAT AGAIN I'M SORRY. YES HI. THE I. CHOPS MONIES TO CONFER WITH CURRENT LAW. CURRENT ASSETS THE AMOUNT OF THE AWARD FOR THE PRIVATE NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS. THEY HAD A TARGET FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS AND THE CITIZENS DID NOT MEET THE TARGET. OKAY SO THEY'D YOU STANNIS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT MEET AT TARGET FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS. AND THAT'S WHY THE REDUCTION IS MORE THEIR. CORRECT THERE IS THAT IT'S TOUGH TO THREE- REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CITY IT'S JUST- TO LET ME TRANSFER STUDENTS. OKAY WELL I. I'M NOT SURE ABOUT- YOU KNOW THAT SPECIFIC JUSTIFICATION I DO KNOW THAT WE STILL HAVE STUDENTS THAT YOU KNOW EVERY PLACE OF HIGHER LEARNING THAT ARE STILL TRYING TO MAINTAIN THAT EDUCATION THAT NEEDS TO. WHAT. DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE FAVORING ONE FORM OF. EDUCATION OVER THE OTHERS THESE PEOPLE STILL NEED SUPPORT TO BE ABLE TO GET THEIR EDUCATION SO- I GUESS I'D PROBABLY WANT TO GET SOME MORE INFORMATION ON. YOU KNOW WHAT. JUST FOR ASIAN THERE IS THERE BUT IT IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE DISCRIMINATORY AND THEN I GUESS TO SEE AS YOU DID YOU HAVE A GO AHEAD. SO I SAID I'D BRIANNA FRIENDS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO AS MY COLLEAGUE EVERY ELEMENT EXPLAINING THIS IS A TECHNICAL- ENACTMENT OF CURRENT LAW. AS THE IT INDEPENDENT INSTITUTIONS TO. MEET THEIR AT T. TARGETS THE CAL GRANT AMOUNT. IS REDUCED. HOWEVER SHOULD THEY BE ABLE TO MEET THOSE TARGETS AS THEY ERE AND- INSTATED IN CURRENT STATUTE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT ACTUALLY AUTOMATICALLY GO BACK UP TO THE ORIGINAL ABOUT. SO SHOULD THAT TARGET IN THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR OUR NEXT FISCAL YEAR. IF THEY WERE TO MEET IT AT ANY POINT SO IF THEY WERE TO BEAT IT AND THE SPRING THAN THAT NOT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY GO UP TO THE ORIGINAL AMOUNT I'M SURE THEY NEED YOU TO HEAR THAT IN THE FUTURE YEAR THAT A CALDERON OUTLOOK BUT- I'D ALSO ASK. HE WAY BILL CURRENT LAW. UNDER BRINGS IN THE BIG OVER HARD RISK A HIGH AMOUNT OF GRANT IN. OKAY GOOD IN ON ME BECAUSE I WOULD WANT TO PUNISH STUDENTS. I HAVE FOR SOMETHING BUT I BUT I WOULD ADD YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD THIS REAL DEMAND ON YOU SEAT TO INCREASE THEIR IN STATE ENROLLMENT. AND MANY OF THOSE CAMPUSES HAVE NOT MET THAT REQUIREMENT- INCLUDING BERKELEY- INCLUDING UCLA. ARE WE ARE WE PULLING. ARE CUTTING CAL GRANT FUNDING. TO PEOPLE THERE THAT THEY'RE NOT MEETING REQUIREMENTS THAT THAT WE WOULD THAT THIS LEGISLATURE IS WANTED THEM- TO MEET. AS WE ARE THEY GETTING THE SAME TREATMENT. I KNOW IT I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE SPIRITS OF CALIFORNIA HAVE TO ADD TO FOR TO MY COLLEAGUES HOWEVER THIS SPECIFIC STATUTE WAS FOR THE INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT- COLLEGES- AND THERE'S A SPECIFIC STATUTE I CAN GET THAT YOUR STOCK ON IT OUTLINES THEIR- BACK. BUT IT SPECIFICALLY FOR TWO FORTY INDEPENDENT PLEDGES I. ARE AND AT T. TRANSFER LEVEL. WELL YEAH I MEAN YOU GO HEAD INTERJECT RIGHT HERE I THOUGHT I'D I THINK TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO. WE MADE THE DECISION TO RE ST THE CUTS TO THE PRIVATE SITUATIONS FOR CAL BECAUSE THOSE ARE IN THERE THE RECESSION. EVERY WOULD THEY FOUGHT TO RESTORE THOSE WE DID LIKE A ONE YEAR YOU KNOW FIX EVERY YEAR THAN FINALLY WAS YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS GET RID OF THIS WE SAID YOU KNOW AS PART OF THE GRAND AS IT'S HAVE YOU DO SOME. BASS HELP US. THANK YOU AND AS- WE COULD- THE GOVERNOR'S HERE WHAT WILL STIR WILL STILL EVALUATING THAT BUT THERE WAS A AND AN ARRANGEMENT- FOR THEM TO ACCEPT MORE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE CALLED TRANSFER STUDENTS AND BUT THAT'S IS ABOUT BUT- ANYWAY- SO AND THEN ALL RIGHT ISSUE MORE UNLESS THING OF AND I APOLOGIZE. CAMPUS IS. PS USE I KNOW THERE WAS AN AUDIT. THE TARGET OF THESE CAMPUS FEES. YOU KNOW. WHAT WHAT ARE WE GOING TO BE SEEN IN TERMS OF ON THE CSU CAMPUS AND IN REGARD TO EASE NO ACTUALLY IN LIGHT OF THIS THIS AUDIT THAT RECENTLY CAME OUT. AND IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN THIS REVISED. WHAT IS A FIRST. HE'S FEES PAY FOR INSTRUCTION BECAUSE A TUITION TUITION IS A FEAT. AS YOU WELL KNOW GREAT RECESSION WE LOST ONE THIRD OF OUR TUITION WE LOST ONE THIRD OF OUR GENERAL FUND SPORT AND DURING THAT AS A REAR. AS A NECESSARY REACTION TO MAKE SURE OUR STUDENTS WERE OF THE EDUCATED IN AND RIGHT AT THE PRO LEVEL SERVICE. THESE WERE BASED AS WELL AS TUITION WAS. BUT IT'S PREMATURE AT THIS POINT SAYS SAY WHETHER WE WILL TUITION AT THIS POINT- TERMS OF FEES ARE SEPARATE- ELABORATE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE ABOLITION. THE REQUIRES. CONSULTATION AND BOATS OF STUDENTS ON ON THE LOCAL CAMPUSES THAT THEN REQUIRES THAT PRESIDENT TO EITHER APPROVE- AN INCREASE OR DECREASE. PROBLEM SHOULD HAVE FEE SO THAT POLICY THE PLAY. RIGHT NOW- WHAT LESS THAN ARE WE ABOUT A WEEK- OF A WAVE OF THAT VISION PROPOSALS. I THINK. THAT AN OUNCE IT'S HARD TO BREATH SPEC. WHETHER WE WOULD BE USING ANY. AT THIS TIME NOR NOR TUITION. IS A SET STATEMENT. DURING TIMES LIKE THIS IN THIS. OPTIMAL TIME TO USE THE WILL KICK YOU SET. I DIDN'T LIKE WAYS IN WHICH TO POTENTIALLY INCREASE THE REVENUE BASE AT THIS POINT IT'S JUST FAR TOO EARLY TO SAY WHETHER THAT'S EVEN. POSSIBLE ON. THAT WE ARE A- THIS. OKAY I'LL DEFER TO MY OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH. WHAT. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER O'DONNELL NOTICED GALLAGHER STERN GREAT BOB THANK YOU ARE MISTER CHAIR- AND JUST JUST QUICKLY HERE I JUST WANT OF APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S HEART BROKEN UP THIS IS NOT A PLEASANT EXERCISE TO GO THROUGH. IT AT YOU. AND DO IT DO YOU I JUST SEE QUICKLY IN THE CSU AND I BRING THAT THE PERSPECTIVE I BRINGS OUT OF THE CHAIR OF THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE AND A TEACHER. AND SOMEONE. IS KIND OF THE NUMBERS OF THE SEAT. ISSUE IN UC SYSTEM REALLY THE CSU SYSTEM IS. THE CHANCE SO LIKES TO CALL UP A SHOW HORSE. I LIKE TO CALL IT. THE WAR COURSE OF CALIFORNIA HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM AYE AYE A STONE SOME LEVEL IT'S BOTH- BUT I DO. IT I MEANT. I'M PLEASED WITH YOUR STORE ABOUT. REAL ONE WHICH ABOUT THE CO NINETEEN CRISIS YEAR. DIVERSE OF CALIFORNIA WELL MAY COME INTO PLAY IN THE FALL OF NOT THE WINTER. EFFECTIVE SEEN SOME SCHOOLS CROSSES. YOU STATES. RIGHT ASIAN.

I THOUGHT THAT WAS THAT'S JUST SOMETHING HOPE PEOPLE CAUGHT I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU WHEN TO GO IN WHEN THEY GO OUT THAT'S JUST SOMETHING TO CONTEMPLATE BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE- ADVANTAGE TRAFFIC VIRTUALLY. HUMBOLDT IS A PLATE. STATE HOUSE LA. SO THANK YOU MATT AND JUST JUST THING THAT CAN PICK MY INTEREST HERE. WELL TO MAKE A COMMON IN THIS MONEY THE GOVERNOR PUT. E. C. SO THAT THE SUBJECT. MATTER FACT THAT. MUCH RESULTING FROM COVER NINETEEN ON MY- YOU SEE WHAT'S THAT AND- I JUST THINK IT RELIGION THAT THOSE KINDS OF TASH REFORM THE CSU LEVEL GIVEN THAT THEY THE ONES THAT PRODUCE TO OUR- OUR OUR TEACHER. SAID WE WANT PARTY'S. I AND A LOT FROM MY A PERSPECTIVE THAT INFORMATION DOES GET HER. TO THE CSU EVEN OUT OF THE UC SYSTEM SOME OF THE STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED IN THE PAST I THINK THEY KIND OF KIND OF STATE YOU SEE THE WORLD DON'T LEAVE THE WORLD. YET THIS TI&lt;c.cyan&gt; WORLD IS THE ONE THAT'S&lt;/c&gt; REALLY. THERE ARE FEW. YEARS SO I HOPE THERE WOULD BE SOME CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT. AND WITH THAT I TURNED IT BACK TO YOU MISTER CHAIR. YES THANK YOU- I HEAR YOU ON THAT CALIFORNIA SUBJECT MATTER PROJECTS I WILL JUST NOTE THAT DOWN. THAT'S A NEW INITIATIVE IF. NO NO YOU SEE AS- THE ACT AS YOU WAS. THE FIRST. FOR TRAINING THE SEA IS SYSTEM BUT THE THIS PROP BACK TO A- EXPERT BEING. YOU KNOW A- AS FOR IN DIFFERENT SUBJECT MATTERS BIRD I THINK TWENTY YEARS IT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN THE UC SYSTEM SO I THINK THIS IS JUST AN EXPANSION OF THAT WELL IF I COULD TURN A WE ARE TAKE A LOOK SWITCHING OVER TO THIS NEW SYSTEM DOES AGAIN I MEANT. THERE THE CENTER THING ARE FUTURE CHEERS BYE LARGE THE- SEE SYSTEM BUT IT. DOESN'T TO HAVE. IF SHE DOESN'T THE NUMBERS THAT THIS YEAR'S USE HAS OR ORDERED TO BE THE PRIORITY- THAT THE CSU MAKES IT SO I HOPE WE WOULD HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. OKAY THANK YOU YOU KNOW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FIRST TO- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THEN I'LL GO TO YOU TO SEE AN END TO THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUT I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON MY COLLEAGUE FROM CHICO. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON CAL GRANTS. SO WE GET HAVE SOMEBODY. THERE FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. REMINISCENT OF A NATIONAL CONVENTION. THANK YOU HAVE IS THANK YOU. BRINGING UP THE SAME POINT AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM- CHICO ON THE READ 11% REDUCTION- TO THE- PRIVATE COLLEGES AND TO STUDENTS ATTENDING THE PRIVATE COLLEGES AS CHAIR OF HIGHER ED AYE AYE WE DOUBT. IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE IT IN OUR ATTEMPT TO GO IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION IT HAD BEEN ATTACHED TO NOT. IN A SET TO PUNISH THE PRIVATES FROM WHEN TO COME BACK EVERY YEAR TO MAKE THE CASE OF WHY THEIR STUDENTS. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM CHICO POINTED OUT DESERVED TO HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF- FINANCIAL AID AS THOSE ATTACKS. STATE AND THE UC. AND I THINK THAT WAS THE WAY WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO MOVE. SO THE QUESTION DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YOU SAY THAT THE PRIVATES DID NOT MEET. I'M HEARING THAT THE TRANSFER GOALS THAT WERE SET OUT IS THAT OVERALL DO DO SUCH. NEEDED AND OTHERS DID NOT BUT BUT ALL OF THEM- ARE FACING THE ALL THE STUDENTS ARE FACING THE SAME CUTS IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN. THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETY BUDGET ACT- YOU INCLUDED THIS TARGETS. BUT INSTITUTIONS MADE ONE THOUSAND AND TEN TRANSFERRED OUT THE CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THEM TO DO TWO THOUSAND. SHOW THAT OVERALL ALL ALL YOU'RE YOU'RE TAKING ALL OF PRIVATES TOGETHER. THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO THE- ASSOCIATE UP INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES REPORT THIS IS WHAT THEY PROVIDE. RIGHT BUT I WOULD ASSUME THAT SOME COLLEGES MET THEIR GOALS AND OTHERS DID NOT. AND WE ARE YOU KNOW BLANKETING AND TREAT THEM ALL THE SAME. SHOP AT THREE I RENTS REVEREND FINANCE I WOULD JUST ADD THAT IT'S NOT UNIVERSITY SPECIFIC IT'S FOR THE WHOLE OF THE A ALL AICC YOU INSTITUTIONS. YEAH NOW THE AYE AYE I WOULD CONCUR WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM CHICO THAT IT SEEMS. DISCRIMINATORY THAT WE ARE YOU KNOW USING. WITH THE SAME BRUSH. MADE IT YOU MET YOUR- DID NOT. AND I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT THAT I OF PERSON DISAGREE WITH THIS PROPOSAL OF FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AND WOULD WANT TO SEE. INDEPENDENT STUDENTS RECEIVING THE SAME. FINANCIAL AID. AS AS THEIR- AS THEIR- WHETHER WHETHER THEY ATTEND A PRIVATE OR A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY- IT CERTAINLY SEEMS. EQUITABLE SO I JUST WENT TO A WEIGH IN ON THAT ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES OF FROM G. CALL. TO YOU SEE. ALL OF A. I WANNA I WANNA THANK YOU SEE- FOR THEIR PRESENTATION AND I BELIEVE THE FIRST TWO SPEAKERS THAT CAME BEFORE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BOTH- APPLAUDED THE GOOD FOR KEEPING THE ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. YOU SEE ARE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE- IN THE BUDGET. AND IT CERTAINLY SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF I JUST WANT TO REMIND THIS COMMITTEE THAT IT WAS IT. ALMOST EIGHT IT'S AGO WHEN- SENATOR ROTH AND MYSELF ON OUR FIRST DAY HERE- AS SENATOR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS- INTRODUCED LEGISLATION. TO FUND THE UC OUR SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND WE DID IT WITH FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR ONGOING APPROPRIATE ACTION. THAT WAS FIFTIES ONCE THE BEGAN AT THE ARE AND WITH GREAT. POSTED THAT NOW EVERY EVERY YEAR IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS. SO THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS FIRST PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INTENDED TO DOUBLE THE SIZE OF THE UC OUR SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. YOU SEE ARE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE WAS THE FIRST PUBLIC SCHOOL OF MEDICINE WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE. AND I JUST REMINDING OF. THIS BODY THAT OF THE NUMBER OF DOCTORS- IN THE INLAND EMPIRE LIKE. INLAND CALIFORNIA IS MUCH LESS THAN ON THE COAST MUCH MUCH LESS AND AT THIS CRISIS JUST HIGHLIGHTS THAT NEED FOR DOCTORS AND INLAND CALIFORNIA SO- AS A MEMBER OF THE INLAND CAUCUS WE PRESENTED- MR TANG AND SENATOR MITCHELL. WITH THE LETTER FOURTEEN DIFFERENT OF MEMBERS OF BOTH THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY SIGNED ON BIPARTISAN A INCLUDING MY COLLEAGUE. OBERNOLTE FROM BIG BEAR- BIPARTISAN AND FOR BOTH SENATORS AND- ANDASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND I WOULD JUST CONCUR WITH UC. THAT WE LOOK AT A UP APPROPRIATING THE WHOLE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS YOU SEE ARE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE IS A BARGAIN. NO OTHER MEDICAL SCHOOL- IN UC IS DOING AS MUCH WITH AS LITTLE. IT IS A UNIQUE PROGRAM THERE IS NO HOSPITAL IT IS A PROGRAM THAT IS. CREATED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE INLAND EMPIRE TO MEET THE CULTURAL NEEDS OF DIVERSE POPULATION AND I AM SURE THAT IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE CORONA VIRUS- RICE IS THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW WE WOULD HAVE- SOMEONE- MEDICAL STUDENT FROM YOU SEE ARE HERE WITH US TODAY. SO I WOULD JUST HOPE THAT- WE WILL CONSIDER THE WHOLE TWENTY FIVE MILLION- APPROPRIATION TO THE UC OUR SCHOOL OF MEDICINE IT IS MUCH NEEDED AND THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO SIGNED ON THAT LETTER. DO YOU SEE. NO NO. WITH THANK YOU THAT TO THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE. SYSTEM. THE. THANK YOU. AS AS- AS MY COLLEAGUES KNOW I COME FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM RICE SERVED THIRTEEN YEARS AS A- TRUSTEE AND RIVERSIDE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. I WAS A PART TIME INSTRUCTOR IN THE SALMON A DINO AND COLLEGE OF THE DESERT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEMS BUT I AM CONCERNED AS MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE WITH THAT DUPLICATION. AND RUN AWAY EXPENSES WITH THE CAL BRIGHT COLLEGE. AND I THINK THAT DURING THESE DIFFICULT TIMES WE SHOULD VERY MUCH CONSIDER. ELIMINATING COMPLETELY THE FUNDING TO CALL RIGHT COLLEGE ALTOGETHER AND RE DIRECT THOSE FUNDS TO EXISTING PROGRAMS AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT WILL PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED ACADEMIC AND STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES. AND I SAY THAT. NOT EASILY. IN I HAD CALLED FOR AN AUDIT OF THE CALIBRATE COLLEGE AND WE PUT THAT AUDIT OFF. TO A LATER DATE THE OUT IT HAD BEEN ASTON APPROVED THE WE PUSH IT OUT TO A LATER DATE SO WE COULD SEE WHAT BUDGET SITUATION WE ARE IN. BUT NOW A FEW MONTHS LATER WE SEE THE DIRE. BUDGET SITUATION THAT WE ARE IN AND I DON'T BELIEVE PERSONALLY THAT WE CAN AFFORD- SUCH A SYSTEM- THAT IS GOING THROUGH SO MANY DIFFICULTIES AND- ADMINISTRATIVELY- AND NOT REALLY SERVING THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS OF CALIFORNIA. AND I ACTUALLY HAVE A QUESTION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU. TO THE DEPARTMENT OF ASKED FOR A CUT OF MY CORRECT OF THE CAL RIGHT COLLEGE DISTRICT. CORRECT THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES A THREE MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION TO HELP MAKE COLLEGE AND CAN YOU. TELL ME WHY THERE WERE NOT FURTHER CUTS- TO THAT COLLEGE DISTRICT- ASKED FOR. WHITE WHY ONLY THREE MILLION. WHETHER THE REDUCTION TO CALIBRATE COLLEGES LARGELY IN LINE FOR WITH OTHER REDUCTIONS THAT WE WERE MAKING ACROSS THE STATE AS WE NOTED- AS WAS NOTED AT THE TOP THERE IS A 10% REDUCTION AND TO THE STUDENT CENTER FUNDING FORMULA ALONG WITH. OF MULTIPLE OF REJECTION SICK CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS 15% REDUCTIONS IN MANY CASES AND- BUT IN THIS CASE THE THREE THREE MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION IS A PERCENT REDUCTION TO THEIR ONGOING. CREATION THANKYOU AND THOSE ARE ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAVE. OKAY THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOW OBERNOLTE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF IT'S AN INCREDIBLY POIGNANT EXPERIENCE TO BE SITTING UP HERE ON THIS DíAS AND CONTEMPLATING. TERRIBLE AT WE ARE CONTEMPLATING TO MAKE IT IN- THE THING FOR HIRED XIN IN CALIFORNIA. BUT TO A MAN ALL OF THIS RENTS HAVE TESTIFIED THAT- THEY REQUEST THAT WE NOT CUT THEIR FUNDING AND- I BELIEVE ME MESSAGE RECEIVED WE WOULD WE DO NOT WANT TO CUT FUNDING BUT WERE PRESSED THE BUDGET CRISIS. AND GATHERED BUT YOU AND- YOU KNOW SOMETHING IS GOT TO BE DONE HERE AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE IN THIS ROOM. I HAD A QUESTION FOR ALL OF THE SEGMENTS AND I'D LIKE TO START WITH. THE CSU- AND THEN MAYBE GO TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THEN THE UC BUT IT RELATES TO A QUESTION THAT MISTER GALLAGHER HAD ASKED HER. ABOUT KEEP THIS FOR AN OUR THAT WHAT SHE WAS UP THE- AN A GROUP AND TO. DISCUSS TUITION MY QUESTION IS THIS. I WOULD WILL BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHAT THE PLAN IS IF WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THESE CUTS- IF. WE HAVE. TO COVER THEM IF WE ARE GOING TO INCREASE JENNIFER COULD HAVE TO DECREASE ROMAN. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CHANGE THE MIXTURE OF STUDENTS TO. MORE OF STATE ROOMS ARE NO I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION AND I OF THE UC SAID THAT IT'S PREMATURE TO ASK THAT QUESTION. I DISAGREE BECAUSE WE'RE HAVE TO BE MAKING DECISIONS. BASED ON THIS INFORMATION THE NEXT THREE WEEKS TO PASS A BUDGET BFORE OUR CONSTITUTIONAL DEADLINE OF JUNE FIFTEENTH SO WE NEED THAT INFORMATION NOW SUCH MY CAN IS. IF WE ARE FOR TECH. BUT TO ME WORK OUT HERE. WHAT WOULD BE THE RESPONSE. WELL ASSEMBLY MEMBER OVER ALL THE- THAT WAS ME ALL RIGHT SIR PERCY ISSUE THAT MADE THAT THE COMMENTS ABOUT TUITION FEES NOT YOU SEE SO I DON'T WANNA. LET LET LET HER BE OF BLAME FOR BRING IT THE T. WORD. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE THINK OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO- WE ARE PROBABLY GOING TO BE IS- ABLE TO. PIECE TOGETHER- SOME SORT OF- STATUS QUO SORT OF SITUATION WE HAVE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT I MENTIONED IN MY INITIAL OPENING COMMENTS AT. ALL I ONE OF THE THINGS OF COURSE IS WE ARE RECEIVING ONE TIME READ PERSPECTIVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO FOR COVERT RELATE CAUGHT. AND KNEW WHAT. THIS HELPFUL. LIGHTS BUT SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR OF OUR ONE TIME A DESIGNATED BALANCES AND RESERVES. I WOULD BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THAT WOULD TALK THAT IN A- IN A STRATEGIC AND- AND- AND- THE WAY IN ORDER SO THAT WE COULD. DO A CRISIS LIKE THIS. THINGS WERE MADE OF THAT WILL. YIELD I THINK SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS OVER TIME. OUR UP THREE THIS. NOBODY FOR THIS TO OCCUR BUT OBVIOUSLY IN THE SHORT TERM- MOST DEPARTMENTS I GENERALLY SEE A TURNOVER OF ABOUT 5% I DON'T THINK WE'RE MUCH DIFFERENT THAN IN THE YEAR. THAT WILL YIELD TEMPORARY IS WELL AS WELL AS IF WE WERE TO HOLD THOSE POSITIONS OPEN- IT. OR LIMIT SEC POSITIONS SO WE HAVE A NUMBER. IS AVAILABLE ON. THE FORGET WE ALSO HAVE THIS THING NO. NOT TRAVEL. WE'VE I THINK ALL OF US ALL OF TESTIFIED TO THE TWO DOCKING THAT OUT AND SIMPLY BECAUSE- BASICALLY CAN'T TROUBLES IS ANYWAY. SO THAT IN THE IN THE SHORT TERM WE CAN WE CAN PIECE IT TOGETHER. ITHINK THE ONE THING THAT WILL OCCUR AND IT'S GREAT THAT YOU'RE ASKING THIS QUESTION. IS THAT IF THIS IS A REPEAT IF IT ENDS UP BEING A REPEAT LIKE THE GREAT RISK BACK. FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHT ON THROUGH A TWENTY ELEVEN TWENTY TWELVE. AT AS THESE ONE TIME SOLUTIONS DRY UP. AS WE DEPLETE. AT YOU CAN'T. WE CAN'T BOIL. TIME WE WILL I TURNED IT MORE PAY IS TO PLOY THOSE BE IN DROPS THOSE COULD BE TUITION. THOSE COULD BE A HOST OF THINGS THAT CAN BE MORE ON GOING AND MORE PAINFUL TO THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE BOTH IN THE INSTRUCTOR WORLD AS IN THE SUPPORT WORLD WE HOPE WE DON'T THERE ARE AT THIS POINT. WE BOARD. DAY MANY OF THEM STATED BOTH AT NO. FROM THEIR VANTAGE THEIR PERSONAL VANTAGE POINT OR DESIRE FOR THERE TO BE A TO INCREASE NOT TIME WILL TELL AS WE GO FOR RIGHT IF THIS IS WORST AND THE GROUP SESSION. AN OBVIOUS ALL THE OPTION AFTER. ABLE THAT'S THAT'S THE REALITY GOING FORWARD I THINK WE ARE IN A PRETTY GOOD SHAPE TO START HERE- WE HAVE LIKE LIKE THE STATE HAS A RAINY DAY FUND THAT HAS PAID OFF A COUPLE OF THOSE DEBT. FOR RECEPTIONS. IT ADDITION. TO SEE ISSUE. BUT MARCHES ON AND THEN. AS THE ADMINISTRATION SIX THAT THIS IS A FOUR YEARS WORTH OF PAIN AND RECURRING SITUATED WHERE PERHAPS THE UNIVERSITY SAYS. OUR SO TO SPEAK WE THE- QUESTION THEN THE BE CHALLENGES WHERE- FEES WILL BE ON THE TABLE TO WHICH WILL BE ON THE TABLE OTHER MEN OF WHERE YOU ARE NOT ALL THAT SUCH A SET. REALITY WHAT WERE. WE CAN AVOID. BOTH WORK FOR IT MAKE SURE THAT AS WE ROLL FORWARD THAT WE ARE PUTTING IN PLACE THINGS THAT ARE. JEFF ENOUGH SO THAT WE DON'T. STUDENTS TUITION INCREASES JUST SO THAT WE ARE NOT HAVING TO EMPLOY. SO THAT THE EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION SORTS OF THINGS THAT HAVE EMPLOYED SO WE WILL DO OUR BEST TO MITIGATE WITH AT LEAST AT. THE LEAST AMOUNT OF ECONOMIC PAIN AS POSSIBLE THAT'S AT LEAST FOR THE SEAT. UP VERY MUCH OF THAT AS WATER CLARITY. OF YEAH BECAUSE OF GOOD NUYS THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF DISCUSSION FROM THE APARTMENT FINANCE AND ALSO FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST ABOUT THE DURATION OF THAT. AND BOB THAT IS SHORTER RATHER THAN LONGER BUT IT'S VERY UNLIKELY TO BE A SINGLE YEAR OF THAT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE A SHORTFALL IN STATE REVENUES SO IN ALMOST CERTAINLY WE ARE HAVING THE SAME DISCUSSION. YEAR AND- BE EVEN THE- SUBTLE I PLAN TO YOUR IS A WISE THING TO DO. SO STE QUESTION OF THE COMMUNITY. PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AT THE CAL FRIEDMAN COLLEGES THE CALIFORNIA WHEN COLLEGES DO NOT HAVE A. YES GO AHEAD GREAT THANK YOU AS I WAS MENTIONING THE COMPANY CAN COLLEGES DO NOT HAVE FEET SETTING AUTHORITY AND THAT IS A RESPONSIBILITY THAT FALLS WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE I THESE. I WILL AFFECTED EIGHTY OF THINGS IT WILL AFFECT THE LEVEL OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT ARE OFFERED AT OUR COLLEGES. ARE GIVEN THE- THAT WERE SELECTED FOR CUTS ARE LIKELY TO AFFECT AT PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT- THAT IMPACT AT THE IN OUTBOX S. AND MAY ALSO AFFECT. A WORKFORCE PROGRAMS WHAT WE WILL DO TO TRY TO MITIGATE THESE CUTS AS- WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO IDENTIFY A FLEXIBILITY IN AREAS WHERE IT IS POSSIBLE. WE ALSO ASK THAT UP MORE OF RESOURCES MAIN AT THE LOCAL LAW SO THAT. WE ARE. ACCESS TO THOSE AND- I IN ORDER TO SERVE MORE STUDENTS AT THIS TIME WE DON'T WANT TO REPEAT THAT IT THAT THE ISSUES THAT WE RAN INTO DURING THE GREAT RECESSION WHERE. WHERE STUDENTS LOST ACCESS AT THE SAME TIME- WE ARE EXPECTING A ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR CUT THESE ARE EXTENSIVELY DEEP A MUCH DEEPER THAN WE SAW DURING THE GREAT RECESSION IN THAT SHORT. OF A TIME. WELL WE WILL BUT WE- BUT I THESE ARE GOING TO HAVE CONSEQUENCES AND FORTUNATELY. SO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU SAY A LACK OF ACCESS YOU TALKING ABOUT A DROP IN ENROLLMENT. IT IT'S UNCERTAIN WHAT WE WILL SEE AT THIS TIME- WE DURING THE SOME OF OUR CLOTHES CAN RELATED EXPENSES WERE THOSE STUDENTS THAT HAD TO UNFORTUNATELY PAS OUT OR DROP OUT OF THEIR- MISSION. BECAUSE THEY JUST NEEDED. TO ADAPT TO THE CRISIS SO OUT WITH OUR EXPENSES RELATED TO STUDENT FEE REIMBURSEMENT AT SIX MIL M. SIX. UP AND DAUGHTERS. ARE CALL JUST DOING EVERYTHING THAT THEY CAN PACKAGE THAT YOU RECEIVE YOU THE IN. LATTER DAY IN BOTH SUCCEED ON. OKAY AN- DO WE CAN'T RECRUIT. IT'S BACK I AND IN THAT THEY CAN READ READ RETAIN THEIR PLAN FOR EDUCATION. WE ALSO QUICKLY TRANSITION TO DISTANCE EDUCATION SO THAT WE CAN MAKE OUR PROGRAMS AVAILABLE HERE WE WILL CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE ARM PROGRAMS- SUCH AS C. T. E. IT HARD TO CONVERT COURSES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THESE PROGRAMS REQUIRE OFTEN. CARRIED LABS AND OTHER A SPACES. THAT WE WILL NEED TO UTILIZE IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND THEN WITH REGARDS TO THE IMPACT OF ON COLLEGES EACH WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT WAY OF ABSORBING THE SOME OF THEM MAY HAVE BUILT OUT RESERVISTS I CAN BE ADDRESS. OTHERS WILL GET DIFFERENT FINING SITUATE SHIN SO THE IMPACT WILL HAVE VERY DIFFERENT OF. THE IMPACT WILL BE VERY DIFFERENT IN OUR HUNDRED FIFTY HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. OKAY THANK YOU AND THE SAME QUESTION OF THIS ISSUE OF THE UC POLICE. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE OF THE UC CAMPUSES HAVE APPROXIMATELY THIS IS A NUMBER FOUR LAST SEPTEMBER WE HAD APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN CORPS FRONT RESERVES THAT COULD BE USED TO QUESTION. SOME BUT WHICH ALREADY HAS IN ADDITION TO UC REGENTS OUR MEETING TOMORROW TO DISCUSS UP MULTI PLAN FOR DEALING WITH A- POTENTIAL STATE REDUCTION SENT THE IMPACTS OF. NINETEEN ON CAMPUSES. DURING THE GREAT RECESSION SOME OF THE WAYS THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DEALT WITH. THE TRUCK FALLS WAS BY PUTTING IN PLACE A HIRING FREEZE A ALSO FOR HIM. IN A TEAR MATTER WHERE EMPLOYEES MAKING. LESS ANNUAL SALARY WORKED FOR LOAD AT A LOWER PERCENTAGE THAN EMPLOYEES MAKING MORE FOR EXAMPLE EMPLOYEES MAKING. FORTY THOUSAND AND ONLY WERE FOR LOW TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND WERE FURLOUGHED AT 12% THOSE ARE SOME POTENTIAL. A SECOND AT THIS TIME AS WELL AT THIS POINT OUR UNIVERSE A CALIFORNIA PRESIDENT PUBLICADO HAS PUT IN PLACE A HIRING FREEZE FOR UC O. P. AND AMEND THE CHANCELLOR'S EIGHTY ARE HIRING SLOW DOWN TO ONLY A CENTRAL ARE CRITICAL POSSESSIONS OF IN ADDITION WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE A SALARY FREE FOR NON REPRESENT. STAFF THESE UP COP IT IS THE POSSIBLE OF A IN THE SPORT THE OF OUR FACULTY EXCEPT FOR MERIT PROGRAM WHICH WERE REQUIRED LOS THAT HAVE THE NINETEEN EIGHT EIGHT- GEN OR PRESIDENT USED ON VOLUNTARY 10% WHICH IS NOT A BIG SAVINGS FOR A AS A BUT- SHE- THERE COMMITTEE BUT ALSO ELIMINATING ALL NON IS AS TRAVEL. AND FREE TO GO CERTAIN UP CONTRACT AGREEMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A AND ONE FINAL QUESTION WELL I'VE GOT THE UC HERE. IS A- BRING YOUR PLANS FOR FALL INSTRUCTION- IS THIS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING TO CONSIDER A RETURN TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION ARE YOU GOING TO. PERSIST AND DISTANCE LEARNING AS A GOING TO BE SO. HM CONTEMPLATING DOING THAT ON. A SYSTEM WIDE BASIS RDHA CAMPUS BY SPACES. ARE REGENTS WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT DURING THEIR MEETING HAPPENING TOMORROW AND THE DAY AFTER WE ARE WAITING FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON WHAT IS A SAFE WAY FOR UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO REPOPULATE. BUT SAYS. IT'S ARE UP AT THE MOMENT. PLEASE START WITH OF GRADUATE COURSES WHERE ESPECIALLY LABORATORIES WHERE INDIVIDUALS CAN HAVE MORE PHYSICAL DISTANCE AND BRING THOSE STUDENTS BACK ON CAMPUS FIRST BUT LIKE I SAID WE'RE WAITING FOR OUR OFFICIAL GUIDANCE FROM DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SO WE CAN DO IT. IN THIS WAY. THANK YOU BYE. THANK MISTER CHAIRMAN. OKAY THANK YOU SOMEONE EMILY MONTH THANK YOU AT THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE PRESENTATION I HAVE. I WAS WORKING FOR HIGHER ED IN OUR LAST RECESSION AND KNOW WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE IT KNOWS WHAT THE PREPARATION OF LEADING UP UNTIL YOU KNOW TO YOU DID GOING TO BE EFFORT. BUT ALL FEELS I'M THE GROUND AND THEY'RE DEFINITELY. AS EXPECTATIONS DIDN'T CHANGE MUCH BUT WORKLOAD FOR AT THE HIGHER END TEAM AND I'M CERTAINLY DID AND MORE WAS EXPECTED- WITH LESS AND- I FEEL FOR WHAT'S ABOUT TO COME I KNOW THE FEELING AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STRUCK THE TIME WAS. BUT JUST TRY. OUT HOW SOME OF THIS WAS IMPACTING STUDENTS AND I REMEMBER A STUDENTS COMING TO ME STUDENTS BEING STRESSED OUT ABOUT THEY HAVE THEM HAVING TO WORK MORE AND TO BE TO AFFORD IT AT THE SAME LEVEL OF THE OF EDUCATION. THEY WERE YOU KNOW. MONTHS BUT HE L. AS THE THING FOR EXPENSIVE. I REMEMBER. THE CHALLENGES- NOT JUST TO THE STUDENTS BUT TO THE FAMILIES TO THE STAFF OF THE YOU KNOW THE STREAMLINING OF SERVICES WHICH TRANSLATES TO SOMETIME LAST STAFF- A IN IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT DEPARTMENTS THAT YOU MORE. SOME OF THE KIND OF HIS WORK OR NOT AND FIGURES TIME RETIRED GRANT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS ALL THAT STUFF- ARE THINGS THEY THINK ABOUT BUT DOT AS- A NEED I'M I THINK DESIRE OUT OF A NEED WITH A LOT SESSION AND- GO INTO THE- MAKING IN BACK SO WHAT WHAT THE BENEFITS. FEEL LIKE FIRST THING I KNOW I'M- THE RIGHT. THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TO HAVE BEEN. ME IN IN A BE ABLE TO DO A ACTUAL FULL STAY BUT SOME SHORT TERM AND IT IS ON WHAT THIS IS TO MEAN FIRST. IN A THIS. AND I'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO ASK WHEN I OF FINANCE AND STATE INTO IT TO ASK. TO THINK ABOUT THAT IN ONE OF OUR LAST BUT HEARINGS WE TAUGHT IN KATY TWELVE ROLLED I'M ABOUT TO LEARN.

OF WHICH ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON SO FOR PUTTING. WE ARE TRYING TO PROPOSE- AND WE HAVE PROPOSED AN ARM SHOULD MAKE REVISION- HOLDING CAL GRANTS- CONSTANT AND MAKING NO CHANGES FULLY FUNDING WITHOUT THE PROGRAM. ALL NOT WITHSTANDING COMMENTS BY IT. GALLAGHER AND A MEMBER MEDINA.

FOR THE FIRST CAUCUS SHINGLES BUT CERTAINLY WORTH TO MAXIMIZE THE EXPERIENCE FOR STUDENTS IN A MORE GLOBAL SCALE BUT THE MADE PROVISION DOES ASK THE SEGMENTS TO LOOK AT HOW THEY CAN IMPROVE- THE OFFERINGS- AND THE QUALITY AND THE AVAILABILITY OF THEIR ON LINE PROGRAMS CHIU FOCUSED ON- IN OUR CALIFORNIA ST STE. AT CHAU CERTAINLY AT THE- VERY ACTIVE WORK WERE ATTEMPTING TO DO ALL THAT WE CAN UP FOR STUDENTS OUT WITH THE TRYING TIMES YOU KNOW THERE ARE ARE. BEFORE AND REDUCTION OF VERY TO BALANCE THE BUDGET.

COLD DECISION AS YOU SAID YESTERDAY IN THEM K. TWELVE EARLY EDUCATION PRESCHOOL AND CHILDCARE DEBATE YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING TO MITIGATE THESE WHETHER IT'S TO. LOOK FOR OTHER CREATIVE WAYS OR TAKE THEM OFF THE BOOKS ENTIRELY I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE NECESSARILY- YOU KNOW GIVING IN AND THINKING WERE UNDER THE GUN HAVE THESE TRIGGERS BECAUSE- THEY THINK IT'S- A THAT. WORK TO BE DONE THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS. ON THIS FRONT CERTAINLY IT WOULD ALL GO AWAY IN GEORGIA BUT FOR THIS YEAR'S CATS WITH AN ACTION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DON'T. LOOK THAT BAD OR OTHER THIS IS. NOT THE OWNER TO YOU ABOUT. IS THE LA OKAY OUTLINE. SOME OF THESE OTHER REALLY CREATE OPTION AND FRANKLY- I THINK THERE AS I SAID YESTERDAY I THOUGHT THERE PROBABLY WERE MORE OPTIONS LIKE THIS AND HIGHER THAN THERE ARE IN K. TWELVE AND EARLY AT LIKE WE DIDN'T SEE ANY. NOT ANY THERE WEREN'T AS MANY OPTIONS YESTERDAY- WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT SOME OF THESE- SO WE WON'T HAVE TO DO THIS ARBITRARY WOULD HAVE A MORE NEGATIVE IMPACT FRANKLY ON STUDENTS- WE HAVE A NUMBER OF IDEAS HERE I'M STRUGGLING WITH HIM ONE BY ONE JUST AND- WE'RE ALL BIG. THERE IS IT THE MISTRESS OPENNESS. THINGS I THINK WE'RE OPEN TO A DISCUSSION WITH THE LEGISLATURE- WITHIN TE CONTEXT OF OUR OVERARCHING FRAMEWORK WHICH IS THAT WE ARE NOT- TAKING ACTIONS THAT. LEAD TO- JUST PUSHING OUT OF THE FISCAL SITUATION IN CHIU FUTURE UP BUDGET YEARS- SO WE CERTAINLY- MESSAGE THAT IN OUR INTRODUCTION CHAPTER- AT THAT SAID. WE DO TO SUPPORT- MANY PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE AND I THINK WE WOULD WE WOULD BE REMISS IF WE DIDN'T SAY WE WOULDN'T. I CERTAINLY RECOMMEND BEING VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE CHOICES THAT WE MAKE YES WERE OPEN TO. ADJUST BUT THE LEGISLATURE AS JUNE WE CAN BASS. PEOPLE MEANT. ANY ACTIONS NEEDED TO INSURE THAT WE MAY A BALANCED BUDGET- IN A THOUGHTFUL WAY OKAY I ALSO WANT TO TALK. TO YOU ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL FOR CALIBRATE FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE I KNOW. IT'S ONE PIECE IS NOT A PANACEA IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE IT BUT- I THINK AS MR MEDINA AT NOTED IN SOME OF THE OTHER COLLEAGUES. THIS IS SOMETHING IT'S GOT OUR INTERESTS IT WAS LAW PROMOTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THROUGH THIS CURRENT EMPIRE GOVERNOR BUT THEN AT. THAT FASTER. FRANKLY AWAY OF MONEY ALL THE PROMISES THAT WERE LAID UP HERE THEY'VE ALL GONE INTO THE TRASH CAN. THAT YOU HAVE X. AMOUNT OF. STUDENTS FROM THIS SECTOR AND THE IDEAL WITH SEIU AND THEIR EMPLOYEES IN THERE IS JUST LESS THAN A DOZEN PEOPLE THAT HAVE ACTUALLY. END UP WHEN IT ACTUALLY WENT ONLINE SO. IT REALLY IS- YOU KNOW THROWING- GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD I'M BRING THAT SAYING BUT LIKE THROWING MONEY AWAY. SO THAT IS WE DO NOW. ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. OR NEW. AND THEY'RE GRADUALLY GETTING BETTER NOW DOING IT FRANKLY BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING FORCED TO SO WE HAVE- AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY HAVE ALL THESE CAMPUSES DO IT NOT REINVENT THE WHEEL SO ARE YOU FINALLY WILLING- ON COMING TO THE REALIZATION THAT MAYBE THERE'S A BETTER WAY ALLOCATE THIS MONEY TO THE CAMPUS DO THAT ON ENDEAVOR. AT THIS TIME THE POSITION TO SUPPORT. FOR THE REDUCTIONS IN THE BUDGET FOR THE CALIBRATED- WE ARE AWARE THAT THEY RECENTLY- HIRED A NEW PRESIDENT THAT WE EXPECT TO DELIVER ON THE PROMISES OF THE COLLEGE- AS WELL AS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR OUR RESIDENTS. THE FORMULA UP THAT THAT HAVE. MANY OF WHICH HAVE ARE IMPACTED TO BY THE- RECESSION- DRIVEN BY COOK BUT NINETY. YEAH I THINK THAT THERE IS THE STRONG BIPARTISAN BY CAMEL REALIZATION THAT YOU KNOW WE SEE THIS THE TOP WILL SWALLOW LAST COUPLE YEARS AND YOU KNOW PROBLEM IS MADE PROMISES NOT KEPT A NEW ERA OF THE COMMUNIQUE IS ONE THING IS NOT THE ONLY NINE UNDERGRAD CAN'T ACROSS. YOUR CSU. THERE'S A COMMUNITY. MISTER GALLAGHER IS AREA AND OBERNOLTE IN RURAL AREAS OF CALIFORNIA THERE ISN'T THE THOUGHT DESERT'S OF NO ACCESS OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE BECAUSE THEY HAVE CAMPUSES AND THEY HAVE- OFF CENTER CAMPUSES SO REALLY AT THAT HE IS NO NEED ANYMORE TO REINVENT THE WHEEL ON THAT SO. WE WILL CERTAINLY HAVE A PURPLE AND I'M SURE THE SENATE WILLIS OFF- I WENT TO- BREAK UP- I KNOW IT'S HARD GOING BACK AND FORTH BUT MAYBE YOU SEE. THE QUESTION OF YOU YES DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE MASCOT IS FOR CALGARY. IS THIS A TRICK QUESTION NOW IT'S AN HONEST QUESTION I DO NOT KNOW THE QUESTION THE QUESTION IS THE MASCOT OF CALIBRATE CALLERS I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS ONE. JUST A QUESTION. ALL RIGHT HE- WELL WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T ASK THOSE TOUGH QUESTIONS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SO I THINK. OKAY THAT WAS A GOOD ONE MR O'DONNELL. SO HOPEFULLY WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE TO GO THERE BUT IF THER WAS A 10% ACROSS THE BOARD FOR UC IS THERE ANY INDICATION OF HOW THE OFFICE THE PRESIDENT AND THE KEY SAYS WOULD IMPLEMENT THAT- TO BE PROPORTIONAL. WHERE ARE YOU IN THIS IN THIS STAGE. AT THIS POINT THE REGION'S HAVE NOT DECIDED HOW THEY WOULD IMPLEMENT A 10% REDUCTION TO ALL OF THE CAMPUS AS CURRENTLY OUR STATE GENERAL FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO THE CAMPUSES BASED ON THEIR- A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT. ENROLLMENT AND OF A THROUGH THE MODEL WOULD TO MOVED TO THE CAMPUS AND IN A SIMILAR MANNER BASED ON THIRD WORLD. GOTCHA AND THEN BASED UPON THE THEIR RESERVES AND THE- MONIES IN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT THAT WE TALK ABOUT A COUPLE YEARS AGO. THE INITIATIVES AND SO FORTH. HOW MUCH HOW MUCH IT ON THE TABLE IS THAT AS FAR AS A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT ARE FROM THE REGION'S TO UTILIZE THOSE RESOURCES AND NOT IMPACT. CAN'T WRAPS UNFORTUNATELY SIR- DO THAT THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE STATE AUDITOR THAT WE UTILIZE OF THE RESERVES THE PAPER CAMPUS OPERATIONS AND TRANSFER THOSE FUNDS TO CAMPUSES THAT HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED AND WILL BE FULL DONE OF AT THE END OF. THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR JUNE. TWENTY TWENTY ARGUES THE O. P. HAS ALREADY A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET DEFICIT HEADING INTO THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR BEFORE THE- A 10% CUT. SO THERE ARE NO FUNDS TO AND FROM THE OKAY RESERVES TO BE PROVIDED THE CAMPUSES UNFORTUNATELY I'M I THINK IT'S KIND OF APPLES AND ORANGES I'M NOT SURE WHEN IT. GET IN THE WEEDS RIGHT HERE BUT THAT'S NOT QUITE ACCURATE AT IT IS A VIçT THOSE TYPE OF PROGRAMS THE CAMPUSES. BUT THERE WERE OTHER INITIATIVES THAT ARE RUN THROUGH THE OFF TO THE PRESS AND- LEAD. YOUR MARKS THAT WE HAVE BROUGH WITH THE LA HOW THE AUDITOR ADDING UP TO THAT. NO LOW HUNG LONG IS A DOLLARS AND- WE THINK THEY'RE STILL NOT TO LOOK FOR POTENTIAL THIRTY REDUCTIONS SO YOU WON'T HAVE THE IMPACT MUCH AS STUDENTS OF THE CAMPUS WILL. AND I AFTER. THAT MY BILLS IN A SECOND SO- MAYBE I CAN COME BACK A BIT LATER BUT I WANTED TO JUST MENTION AND THIS IS A REALLY FOR YOU SEE BUT FOR YOU. TO YOU AS A WHOLE JUST KIND OF THE COMMENTS ON STUDENT FEES I THINK WE NEED TO BE REALISTIC THAT. FOR EXAMPLE THE UC WE FIND WE'VE BEEN IT THROUGH GENERAL FUND SUPPORT STUDENT FEE REVENUE AND- NON RESIDENT. AND CSU IT'S MAINLY- STUDENT FEE SUPPORT AND GENERAL FUND SUPPORT AND CELLS YOU KNOW THOSE ARE THE TWO OR THREE LIKE. THE LEGS OF THE STOOL. AND SO. THE MAJORITY OF CSU STUDENTS DAHLE PASSED IN PEACE ANYWAY. AND SO MAY TIMES WERE SUBSIDIZING UPPER MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES- SO THAT'S A POLICY CHOICE WE HAVE TO MAKE AND SO BY. BY FREEZING IT WE CAN SAY OKAY WE YOU KNOW PAT OURSELVES ON THE BACK NO INCREASES I GET THAT. BUT THAT LIMITS ACCESS FOR ENROLLING MORE STUDENTS TO CANNELLA HAVING A LITTLE BROTHER OR SISTER NEIGHBOR GET INTO THIS YES YOU ARE YOU SEE SO. I THINK WE NEED TO REALIZE THAT AND THERE'S NO I THINK IT THREE WHERE THERE IS ALWAYS A CAP. ON ON ON FEES WE LOOK AT YOUR CABLE BILL YOUR YOUR RENT AND SO FORTH HAVING MODERATE AND PREDICTABLE INCREASES LET'S SET IT. ON AVERAGE WITH THE CPI AND SO FORTH IS I THINK NOT UNREASONABLE SO. AS NOT OUR DECISION IS UP TO THE REGION'S IMAGE AND THE AND THE TRUSTEES WE CONTROL COMMUNITY COLLEGE FEES BUT I JUST THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE AT THE STATE. REALISTIC THAT THE SAVING OF INCREASES THE MATTER HOW- IT'S THE ARE HAVE. SO WITH THAT I'M GOING TO. TURN ME OVER TO MR MEDINA FOR A FEW MOMENTS. AND WE HAVE A FEW MORE QUESTIONS FROM SOMEONE MEMBER LEE MON AND IF ANY OTHERS WANT TO ENGAGE AND THEN WE'LL GET TO PUBLIC COMMENTS THANK YOU. BOB. FIVE THIRTY THE PHONES ARE GOING TO TURN OFF. SO. BY THE END OF THE WE'LL TRY TO SLEEP ON. I STARTED ASKING I THINK THAT THE INITIAL I WAS FOR BOTH THE SECOND AND DEAL AT AND THEN HOPING THAT THE SEGMENTS- AND- AND FOR THE PEACE. ABOUT WHAT THE LOS BEFORE THE IMPACT IS GOING TO BE FOR STUDENTS GIVEN THE PROPOSED BUDGET. SINCE I'M SITTING RIGHT HERE I'LL TAKE THE QUESTION THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER LAMONT- WERE VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE QUALITY OF INSTRUCTION FOR STUDENTS EXPOSURE LEE AS THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC CRISIS CONTINUES AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IN FINANCIAL LOSSES THE UC SYSTEM WILL HAVE TO BEAR IN OUR OTHER AREAS. SO WE'RE VERY WORK OUT OF THE QUALITY OF INSTRUCTION IF WE CONTINUE TO LOSE FUNDING. AT THIS POINT WE ARE PUTTING EMPHASIS ON STUDENT SAFETY AND THIS IS WHY WE HAVE MOVED TO REMOTE INSTRUCTION ON ALL OUR CAMPUSES. AND WE ARE LOOKING AT HOW TO SAFELY RE POPULATE OUR CAMPUSES AND BRING STUDENTS BACK FOR THAT UP ON CAMPUS EXPERIENCE. I'LL HAND IT OVER TO SEE US YOU KNOW UNLESS YOU HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION FOR ME. I DO SO WHAT DO YOU HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT. A CHANGING QUALITY COULD LOOK LIKE. CHANGING QUALITY COULD BE FEWER LECTURERS BEING HIRED- FOR FOLLOWING TERMS IT WOULD MEAN. LONGER POTENTIAL WAIT LIST FOR CERTAIN MAJORS- IT COULD MEAN FEWER COURSES GRADE MORE BOTTLENECKS AND CAUSING STUDENTS TO TAKE LONGER TO GRADUATE ONE OF THE THINGS THE UC SYSTEM HAS REALLY BEEN WORKING ON ITS OF. ELIMINATING BOTTLENECKS IN MAJOR SO THAT STUDENTS CAN GRADUATE FASTER BY HAVING STUDENTS GRADUATE FASTER RATHER THAN GRADUATING IN FIVE AND A HALF YEARS OF IF WE GET THEM TO GRADUATE IN FOUR AND A HALF OR FOUR YEARS THEY TAKE ON LESS DEBT AND THEY MOVE INTO THE WORK FORCE FASTER. SO A STUDENT MAY HAVE TO BE ENROLLED LONGER IF WE HAVE TO CUT BACK ON THE NUMBER OF COURSE OFFERINGS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YEAH. ALWAYS SORRY FOR THE DELAY THERE'S A LONG ON RAMP HERE FOR THAT TESTIMONY OF ALL OF IT SO THAT'S WHY TAKES WELL FIRST TO GET GET INVOLVED HERE ARE FROM SEASONSPERSPECTIVE I THINK- MY COLLEAGUE FROM YOU SEE NAILED IT ON THE HEAD TERMS OF MOST ISSUES WE DEAL WITH WELL I THINK I'D LIKE TO ADD- IS A DISTINCTION. BETWEEN WHAT WOULD BE THE SHORT TERM IN THE LONG TERM I THINK WHAT- IS MISTER TANYA FROM UC WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS A LITTLE BIT LONGER TERM FOR US IT WOULD BE MORE OF A- WILL IF WE HAVE SUSTAINED. RECURRING ONGOING COST YEAR AFTER YEAR THAT WE ARE GONNA PROBABLY HALF PRESSURES ON A ROLE THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE- DIFFICULT IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE HIGHER ALL THE FACT THAT THE WE NEED TO SERVE ALL OF OUR STUDENTS SO THAT'S A LONGER TERM AND SHORT TERM I THINK- LIKE I SAID EARLIER I THINK WE- ARE. PRETTY WELL EQUIPPED TO WHETHER A- VERY IMMEDIATE STORE. SO THAT WE ARE ABLE TO UTILIZE OUR FEDERAL FUNDS ARE RESERVES OTHERS A QUESTION EARLIER ABOUT THE LEVEL OF RESERVES THAT- YOU SEE HAD ALL JUST- I'LL JUST PROVIDE YOU OURS. WE'VE SOCKED AWAY APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS SYSTEM WIDE FOR TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES IN OUR OPERATING FUND THAT'S THE INSTRUCTION AND THAT IT MEAN. TO SUPPORT US UP AND EIGHT SO. I BE REMISS IN. TELLING YOU THAT IF- YOU DECIDED THAT- WELL THAT'S THE AMOUNT YOU COULD CUT THAT THE C. ISSUE THAT WOULD BE THE INAPPROPRIATE RESPONSE BECAUSE UP AS THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES STATED- WE ARE PROBABLY IN FOR THREE OR FOUR YEAR PERIOD SIGNIFICANT- ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN YOUR TWO F. F. YOU NEEDED TO DIVE IN AND WANT TO CUT AT THE UNIVERSITY A DEEPER. ONE OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT TO YOU. IS THAT RATHER THAN THE- THAT NEGATIVE IMPACT OF STUDENTS ON THE MEDIAN. ON THE IMMEDIATE FRONT ALLEGE A LITTLE OUT OF TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT OUR CAMPUSES- ARE GENERALLY DOING. AS AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO COPE IN NINETEEN SO. OBVIOUSLY ALL OF OUR ALL OF OUR- CAMPUSES WERE IN PRETTY QUICK DISARRAY RIGHT WITH STUDENTS DECIDING TO LEAVE CAMPUS THERE ARE STUDENT HOUSING AND- YOU KNOW WEST WITH SWITCHING TO- ONLINE. FORMAT WITH SEVENTY THOUSAND- COURSES BEING CONVERTED IMMEDIATELY TO THE VIRTUAL MALL BUT ALLERGY- ONE THING THAT REALLY WAS. FANTASTIC TO SEE AND HEAR AND EVEN. WAS AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AS WELL. WAS THAT. WHEN STUDENTS NEEDED ACCESS TO. OUR HEART- SOFTWARE TO LICENSES INTERACT CONNECTIVITY- OUR CAMPUSES STEPPED UP BIG. THE STEP THE BIG IN TERMS OF PROVIDING WIFI ACCESS AFFECTED LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IF FULLER TED. I THEY EXPANDED. ACCESS AND LOTS OF STUDENTS COULD DRIVE IN THE CAMPUS PARK IN THE PARKING LOT AND HAVE GREAT INTERNET ACCESS TO BE ABLE TO- DEAL WITH THIS- THIS CRISIS A LITTLE BIT UNIQUELY BUT STILL BE ABLE THAT- TO DEAL WITH AT. BE INVOLVED IN THE COURSE WORK IN. RECEIVE OTHER SERVICES. YES I DO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LITTLE SITUATION WITH THE TIME HERE. AND SO I AM AMY I HATE TO DO THIS BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO CUT YOU OFF AND SEE IF WE COULD JUST GET TO THE FINAL ONE NO IT'S OKAY. IT'S YOU'RE NOT SEEN WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE A JUST HAVE AN- ISSUE WITH THE TIMING. AND SO I THINK WE JUST NEED ONE MORE SECTOR- TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION AND THEN. GIVEN OUR OUR SITUATION AT THE TIME I'M GOING TO MOVE IT PASSED TO THE NEXT. A MEMBER BUT I THINK I THINK YOU FOR THAT AND I APOLOGIZE FOR HAVING TO CUT YOU OFF. GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF A LIGHTNING SPEED ROUND JUST BECAUSE OF OUR TIME CONSTRAINT. SOME EARLY NOT. I THAT'S ONE OF THE MEN THAT THE IMPACT WILL BE VERY DIFFERENT ACROSS OUR SEVENTY THREE DISTRICTS- AS YOU KNOW THERE LOCALLY GOVERNED SO THEY WILL HAVE TO IDENTIFY WAYS TO MITIGATE THESE CUTS LOCALLY BUT IN THE PAST AND WHAT WE MAY SEE WHERE I OVER BILLION DOLLAR COTTON ONE YEAR IS ATTRITION LARGER CLASS SIZES ARE AND GROWING BASIC NEEDS FOR STUDENTS AS YOU RECALL- WE ENTERED THIS. THIS RECESSION WHICH- SIR THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS AND THAT HAS NOT CHANGED IF ANYTHING COPA NINETEEN EXPOSE THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DISPARITIES THAT OUR STUDENTS FACE OUT WE ALSO WILL HAVE PRESSURES ON ACCESS- AND SO AS YOU- AS AT THE LEGISLATOR INNER LET IT LEGISLATURE IN CONSIDER OPTIONS MOVING FORWARD WE DO WHAT AGAIN FLEX THE IN PROGRAM SO THAT WE CAN COVER YOU DIDN'T OF RESOURCES TO STE MORE. BUT I LIMITED RESOURCES WE ALL ASK THAT ON THAT YOU LIMIT PRACTICE THAT USE ME AS A. THROUGH TWO OTHER. IN OTHER TWELVE OUT TO THE AND THAT YOU ALSO LOOK AT LIMITING ON FOR ME SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
