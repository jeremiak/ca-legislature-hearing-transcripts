QUALITY. AND DEPENDABLE WE'VE

00:45:37.868 --> 00:45:41.138 region:rollup2
CONSISTENTLY STATED THAT ANY TAX

INCREASE SHOULD BE BROAD BASED

00:45:41.138 --> 00:45:45.910 region:rollup2

RECIDIVISM IN THE STATE BUT WE

00:46:15.139 --> 00:46:17.708 region:rollup2
THINK THIS BILL GOES ABOUT IT

00:46:16.407 --> 00:46:18.876 region:rollup2
THE WRONG WAY.

00:46:17.708 --> 00:46:20.845 region:rollup2

00:46:18.876 --> 00:46:22.013 region:rollup2

BUSINESSES SEEKING TO CONTRACT

00:46:30.521 --> 00:46:34.191 region:rollup2

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:35.726 region:rollup2
BILL UNDERMINES EXISTING.

00:46:34.191 --> 00:46:37.128 region:rollup2

00:46:43.501 --> 00:46:45.703 region:rollup2
UNDERMINED.

00:46:44.201 --> 00:46:47.371 region:rollup2
I'M BY RAISING THE COST OF ALL

00:46:45.703 --> 00:46:49.040 region:rollup2
THESE CONTRACTS I'M WITHOUT THE

ABILITY TO BUILD THIS TAX IN THE

COST STRUCTURE ITSELF IT REALLY

00:46:50.741 --> 00:46:52.743 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY PUT SMALL

00:46:51.742 --> 00:46:54.078 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES AT A SEVERE

00:46:52.743 --> 00:46:55.346 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGE.

00:46:54.078 --> 00:46:57.048 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO COMPETITIVE

00:46:55.346 --> 00:46:58.549 region:rollup2
BIDDING SINCE THEY ALREADY BEEN

FINALLY WE JUST MORE BROADLY

00:47:00.484 --> 00:47:02.887 region:rollup2
DISAGREE I THINK WHAT THE

00:47:01.218 --> 00:47:05.022 region:rollup2
GENERAL. CHARACTERIZATION IS OF

00:47:02.887 --> 00:47:06.557 region:rollup2
THESE CONTRACTS AS A PRIVILEGE

00:47:05.022 --> 00:47:07.825 region:rollup2
OR PROFITEERING OUR TO THOSE

00:47:06.557 --> 00:47:10.027 region:rollup2

00:47:23.074 --> 00:47:26.777 region:rollup2
BY CONTRACTING ESPECIALLY WITH A

00:47:25.142 --> 00:47:28.312 region:rollup2
SMALL BUSINESS WE THINK. THAT

00:47:26.777 --> 00:47:30.014 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S JUST BAD POLICY.

00:47:28.312 --> 00:47:31.349 region:rollup2
WITHIN THIS BILL WHEN IT COMES

00:47:30.014 --> 00:47:32.817 region:rollup2
TO THE NEGATIVE CHARACTERIZATION

00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:34.685 region:rollup2
AYE WE BELIEVE THESE CONTRACTS

00:47:32.817 --> 00:47:36.153 region:rollup2
ARE ACTUALLY A WIN WIN FOR

00:47:34.685 --> 00:47:37.488 region:rollup2
TAXPAYERS AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISE

00:47:36.153 --> 00:47:39.290 region:rollup2
WHICH WE DO MORE TO ENCOURAGE IS

00:47:37.488 --> 00:47:40.758 region:rollup2

00:48:40.718 --> 00:48:43.988 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:48:41.819 --> 00:48:45.689 region:rollup2
MUCH NEEDED REVENUE TO SUPPORT

00:48:43.988 --> 00:48:46.857 region:rollup2
PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND UNTIL

THERE ARENO PRIVATE PRISONS WE

00:48:46.857 --> 00:48:48.959 region:rollup2

00:49:03.007 --> 00:49:07.011 region:rollup2
GO UP.

00:49:04.608 --> 00:49:08.846 region:rollup2

ON IN IF THERE WAS SOME

00:49:37.374 --> 00:49:41.011 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT BOOST IN COSTS AT

THE TIME OF A NEW CONTRACT IT

00:49:41.011 --> 00:49:42.880 region:rollup2
WILL BE UP TO THE STATE TO

00:49:41.779 --> 00:49:44.748 region:rollup2

REASONABLE INCREASE. OFFER THE

SERVICES BEING PROVIDED.

00:49:46.617 --> 00:49:51.455 region:rollup2
WELL I MEAN THEY CAN SAY WE GOT

00:49:48.853 --> 00:49:52.790 region:rollup2
TO PAY TEN PERCENT MORE AND PLUS

00:49:51.455 --> 00:49:55.192 region:rollup2
THE CONTRA BUTTON THAT BE

00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:56.694 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED. A REASONABLE.

00:49:55.192 --> 00:49:57.761 region:rollup2
COST BY THE STATE I DON'T KNOW

00:49:56.694 --> 00:49:59.964 region:rollup2

JUST ASKING.

00:49:59.964 --> 00:50:01.799 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK WE'RE SAYING THAT

00:50:01.065 --> 00:50:04.034 region:rollup2
THE STATE NEEDS TO MAKE A

00:50:01.799 --> 00:50:05.202 region:rollup2
STATEMENT OF ITS VALUES AND THAT

00:50:04.034 --> 00:50:06.937 region:rollup2
IF THE STATE IS SPENDING FOUR

00:50:05.202 --> 00:50:10.307 region:rollup2
AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN.

00:50:06.937 --> 00:50:11.976 region:rollup2
ON A SERVICE THAT LARGELY I HAS

00:50:10.307 --> 00:50:12.877 region:rollup2
A NEGATIVE OUTCOME ON CALIFORNIA

00:50:11.976 --> 00:50:14.445 region:rollup2
CITIZENS.

00:50:12.877 --> 00:50:16.647 region:rollup2
INCLUDING WHAT THE TAXPAYERS

00:50:14.445 --> 00:50:18.849 region:rollup2
PAY WHY SHOULD THE TAXPAYERS

00:50:16.647 --> 00:50:20.317 region:rollup2
ALSO EXPERIENCE SOME BENEFIT BY

00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:23.420 region:rollup2
HAVING REVENUE THAT IS CREATED

00:50:20.317 --> 00:50:25.189 region:rollup2
TO HELP PREVENT. AND ULTIMATELY.

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:26.624 region:rollup2
CHRIS THE NOT ACROSS ORATION

00:50:25.189 --> 00:50:28.659 region:rollup2
THAT CALIFORNIANS PAY FOR OUR

00:50:26.624 --> 00:50:30.227 region:rollup2
STATE WHAT THE CONCERN THERE IS

00:50:28.659 --> 00:50:31.595 region:rollup2
JUST THAT IT'S GOING TO COST THE

00:50:30.227 --> 00:50:33.497 region:rollup2
STATE MONEY.

00:50:31.595 --> 00:50:34.565 region:rollup2
COMING FROM ONE PRODUCT POCKET

00:50:33.497 --> 00:50:36.567 region:rollup2
THEN YOU'RE PUTTING ANOTHER.

00:50:34.565 --> 00:50:38.469 region:rollup2
.

00:50:36.567 --> 00:50:39.803 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I GET NOW I DON'T THINK

00:50:38.469 --> 00:50:41.438 region:rollup2
A PRISONS GONNA STAY OPEN IF

00:50:39.803 --> 00:50:42.840 region:rollup2
IT'S LOSING MONEY.

00:50:41.438 --> 00:50:44.608 region:rollup2
AND UNDER YOUR BILL THAT WOULD

00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:46.210 region:rollup2
BE LOSING MONEY IF IT HAD TO PAY

00:50:44.608 --> 00:50:47.645 region:rollup2
ALL THESE FEES.

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:49.546 region:rollup2
SO THAT THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING

00:50:47.645 --> 00:50:50.814 region:rollup2
TO FIGURE OUT.

00:50:49.546 --> 00:50:51.815 region:rollup2
WELL THESE COMPANIES OPERATE IN

00:50:50.814 --> 00:50:53.350 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE STATES AND

00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:55.185 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS IN THEY ARE HIGHLY

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:56.687 region:rollup2
PROFITABLE AND SO IT'S

00:50:55.185 --> 00:50:58.389 region:rollup2
QUESTIONABLE THAT THEY'RE LOSING

00:50:56.687 --> 00:51:00.157 region:rollup2
MONEY EVEN IN THE FACE. OF

00:50:58.389 --> 00:51:02.126 region:rollup2
PAYING AN ADDITIONAL FEE THE FUN

00:51:00.157 --> 00:51:03.661 region:rollup2
CERTAIN SERVICES THAT HAVE A

00:51:02.126 --> 00:51:04.962 region:rollup2
NEXUS TO WHAT THEY DO THESE

00:51:03.661 --> 00:51:06.063 region:rollup2
COMPANIES REMAIN HIGHLY

00:51:04.962 --> 00:51:07.798 region:rollup2
PROFITABLE.

00:51:06.063 --> 00:51:09.533 region:rollup2
AND I BELIEVE.

00:51:07.798 --> 00:51:10.634 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA WOULD MAKE IN

00:51:09.533 --> 00:51:12.670 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT STATEMENT BY SAYING.

00:51:10.634 --> 00:51:14.338 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN EXPECTATION THAT

00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:15.139 region:rollup2
THESE COMPANIES WILL CONTRIBUTE

00:51:14.338 --> 00:51:16.740 region:rollup2
TO SOMETHING THAT WILL

00:51:15.139 --> 00:51:17.908 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:20.144 region:rollup2
INCARCERATION OUR STATE.

ARE FULLY FUNDED.

00:51:59.450 --> 00:52:03.020 region:rollup2

00:52:10.628 --> 00:52:17.368 region:rollup2
THAT ONE YOU KNOW THE THING IS.

00:52:15.332 --> 00:52:19.103 region:rollup2
WHAT? DOUBLE WOULD BEEN APPEAR

00:52:17.368 --> 00:52:20.971 region:rollup2

LAYER OF TAXES BEING ADDED ON?

00:52:25.509 --> 00:52:29.680 region:rollup2
TO EVERYTHING I CAN'T THINK OF

00:52:28.045 --> 00:52:31.148 region:rollup2
ANY CATEGORY WE DON'T TAX A

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:31.815 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT MORE. AND IT'S ALL

00:52:31.148 --> 00:52:33.984 region:rollup2
CUMULATIVE.

00:52:31.815 --> 00:52:35.119 region:rollup2
AND.

THIS PARTICULAR TAX.

00:52:35.119 --> 00:52:38.389 region:rollup2

00:52:37.421 --> 00:52:40.324 region:rollup2
AS WELL MEANT IS IT IS.

00:52:38.389 --> 00:52:43.427 region:rollup2
WILL.

00:52:40.324 --> 00:52:45.396 region:rollup2
STIFLE. ANY VENDOR I MADE MY

00:52:45.396 --> 00:52:49.500 region:rollup2
THE HIGHEST VALUE. FOR THE

LOWEST PRICE POSSIBLE.

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:52.936 region:rollup2
AND IF I'M NOT ALLOWED.

00:52:51.168 --> 00:52:55.339 region:rollup2
TO.

00:52:52.936 --> 00:52:56.874 region:rollup2
FACTOR IN A TEN PERCENT TAX

00:52:55.339 --> 00:52:58.642 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

00:52:56.874 --> 00:53:00.678 region:rollup2
THE LANGUAGE IS VERY CLEAR.

00:52:58.642 --> 00:53:03.447 region:rollup2
IF I RAISE MY PRICE TEN PERCENT

00:53:00.678 --> 00:53:04.581 region:rollup2
TO COVER MY COST OF THE TAX.

00:53:03.447 --> 00:53:06.116 region:rollup2
THEN I CAN BE PERSECUTED

00:53:04.581 --> 00:53:08.318 region:rollup2
PROSECUTED EVERY WHICH WAY.

00:53:06.116 --> 00:53:10.754 region:rollup2
SO.

00:53:08.318 --> 00:53:11.855 region:rollup2
THAT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT.

00:53:10.754 --> 00:53:13.524 region:rollup2
FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO

00:53:11.855 --> 00:53:15.125 region:rollup2

00:53:30.407 --> 00:53:33.744 region:rollup2
AT THE TOP AS YOU TALKED ABOUT

00:53:32.276 --> 00:53:35.612 region:rollup2

ARE CURRENT. FUNDING FORMULA

00:53:38.215 --> 00:53:41.385 region:rollup2
SEES US FUNDED IN THE STATE

00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:41.885 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE AROUND FORTY SIX IN

00:53:41.385 --> 00:53:43.120 region:rollup2
THE NATION IN PER PUPIL

00:53:41.885 --> 00:53:45.155 region:rollup2
SPENDING.

PRESCHOOL ACTIVITY OF THAT WE

00:53:50.694 --> 00:53:54.765 region:rollup2
WOULD HOPE FOR AND I BELIEVE

00:53:52.463 --> 00:53:56.033 region:rollup2
THAT MISS CABLE CAN SPEAK TO

00:53:54.765 --> 00:53:57.601 region:rollup2
WHERE WE RANK ARE WHERE WE ARE

00:53:56.033 --> 00:54:00.204 region:rollup2
IN OUR PARTICIPATION RATES BUT

00:53:57.601 --> 00:54:02.106 region:rollup2
THEY'RE MUCH LOWER. THAN NEEDED

VERY LOW PARTICIPATION RATES.

00:54:30.567 --> 00:54:33.403 region:rollup2
NOT BASED OFF OF INTEREST BUT

HERE.

00:55:00.364 --> 00:55:03.133 region:rollup2
I NOTICED THAT EVERYONE IN THE

00:55:01.765 --> 00:55:04.301 region:rollup2
ROOM WANTS TO SAY THAT THEY WANT

00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:06.069 region:rollup2
TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM BUT NO

00:55:04.301 --> 00:55:07.805 region:rollup2
WANTS TO PAY FOR IT.

00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:09.373 region:rollup2
CLEARLY I REPRESENT A COMMITTEE

00:55:07.805 --> 00:55:11.775 region:rollup2
WHERE THIS IS AN ISSUE AND HOW

00:55:09.373 --> 00:55:13.343 region:rollup2
WE AND ONE OF THE BEST WAYS IS

00:55:11.775 --> 00:55:15.179 region:rollup2
IS THROUGH EARLY EDUCATION I

00:55:13.343 --> 00:55:16.413 region:rollup2
HAVE A THREE YEAR OLDS. THE FACT

00:55:15.179 --> 00:55:17.314 region:rollup2

YEAR OLDS ARE ALLOWED ACCESS.

00:55:17.314 --> 00:55:21.151 region:rollup2
TO TO.

00:55:19.116 --> 00:55:22.252 region:rollup2
EDUCATION IS INSANE TO ME THAT

00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:24.454 region:rollup2
SIXTY PERCENT OF WHERE MY

00:55:22.252 --> 00:55:27.024 region:rollup2
DAUGHTER MOVES TO NEXT WOULD BE

00:55:24.454 --> 00:55:29.359 region:rollup2
WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR HER. IS

00:55:27.024 --> 00:55:31.395 region:rollup2
UNACCEPTABLE TO ME I DO HAVE ONE

00:55:29.359 --> 00:55:33.764 region:rollup2
QUESTION WITH THIS ARE EITHER

00:55:31.395 --> 00:55:35.832 region:rollup2
BILL MAKE PREP PRISONS NON

00:55:33.764 --> 00:55:36.867 region:rollup2
PROFITABLE FOR PRIVATE PRISONS.

00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:38.836 region:rollup2
TEN PERCENT WOULD THAT MAKE IT

00:55:36.867 --> 00:55:40.337 region:rollup2
EITHER PREP WOULD THAT MAKE IT

00:55:38.836 --> 00:55:41.838 region:rollup2
NOT PROFITABLE I'D I DO NOT

00:55:40.337 --> 00:55:44.374 region:rollup2
THINK SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

00:55:41.838 --> 00:55:45.809 region:rollup2
RATE OF PROFITABILITY FOR. THE

00:55:44.374 --> 00:55:47.678 region:rollup2
COMPANIES THAT OWN PRIVATE

00:55:45.809 --> 00:55:49.513 region:rollup2
PRISONS IT IS SIGNIFICANT AND

00:55:47.678 --> 00:55:51.048 region:rollup2
GROWING AND.

00:55:49.513 --> 00:55:52.916 region:rollup2
I DO NOT THINK SO.

00:55:51.048 --> 00:55:54.418 region:rollup2
IT IS NOT FOR ME TO DETERMINE

00:55:52.916 --> 00:55:56.420 region:rollup2
WHAT THEIR PROFITABILITY IS BUT

00:55:54.418 --> 00:55:58.188 region:rollup2
I WOULD ONLY ILLUSTRATE THAT THE

00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:59.923 region:rollup2
PROFITABILITY IS SIGNIFICANT AT

00:55:58.188 --> 00:56:01.859 region:rollup2
THIS TIME.

00:55:59.923 --> 00:56:03.560 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AND IN Y OPINION

00:56:01.859 --> 00:56:05.429 region:rollup2
CAPITALISM IS THE HIGHEST VALUE

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:08.365 region:rollup2
FOR THE LOWEST COSTS TENDS TO BE

00:56:05.429 --> 00:56:09.733 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE CLOSE.

00:56:08.365 --> 00:56:11.802 region:rollup2
I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS

00:56:09.733 --> 00:56:13.303 region:rollup2

00:56:11.802 --> 00:56:14.438 region:rollup2
SAY THIS ABOUT SOME OF THE

00:56:13.303 --> 00:56:16.540 region:rollup2
COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE FROM

00:56:14.438 --> 00:56:18.508 region:rollup2

WE'VE ACTUALLY TAKEN GREAT PAINS

00:56:20.477 --> 00:56:24.915 region:rollup2
TO PROTECT SMALL BUSINESS BY

00:56:22.646 --> 00:56:26.750 region:rollup2
EXEMPTING ANY BUSINESS WHOSE.

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:29.620 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS.

00:56:27.484 --> 00:56:31.455 region:rollup2
WIT WE UNDERSTAND.

00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:32.589 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE ISSUES AROUND

00:56:31.455 --> 00:56:34.057 region:rollup2
TAXATION.

00:56:32.589 --> 00:56:35.959 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS A STATE THAT

00:56:34.057 --> 00:56:37.094 region:rollup2
NEEDS REVENUE. AND CALIFORNIA IS

00:56:35.959 --> 00:56:39.162 region:rollup2

PROGRAMS WITHOUT ANY REVENUE.

00:56:39.162 --> 00:56:42.065 region:rollup2

.

00:59:06.877 --> 00:59:10.080 region:rollup2
VERY BRIEFLY WE DO NOT WE TAKE

00:59:08.445 --> 00:59:11.281 region:rollup2
NO POSITION ON THE PORTION OF

00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:13.116 region:rollup2
THE BILL THAT PER THAT PROPOSALS

AND USE TAX ON SALES OF FIREARMS

00:59:13.116 --> 00:59:16.620 region:rollup2
AND AMMUNITION. BUT WE DO NOT

00:59:15.118 --> 00:59:19.523 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT THE WAY TO SPEND

00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:20.190 region:rollup2
THAT MONEY IS ON MORE POLICE IN

00:59:19.523 --> 00:59:21.625 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS.

FOR MANY STUDENTS UP PRESENCE

00:59:25.095 --> 00:59:28.131 region:rollup2
OF A SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER

00:59:26.663 --> 00:59:29.733 region:rollup2
MAKES SCHOOL FEEL LESS SAFE.

00:59:28.131 --> 00:59:31.368 region:rollup2
THEY'RE OFF ALL TOO OFTEN USED

00:59:29.733 --> 00:59:33.403 region:rollup2
TO ASSIST WITH WHAT WHAT SHOULD

00:59:31.368 --> 00:59:34.938 region:rollup2
BE ROUTINE DISCIPLINARY MATTERS

00:59:33.403 --> 00:59:36.740 region:rollup2
AND ALL TOO OFTEN THOSE

00:59:34.938 --> 00:59:38.208 region:rollup2
INTERACTIONS HAVE TURNED INTO A

00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:39.509 region:rollup2
BOMB EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE

00:59:38.208 --> 00:59:40.977 region:rollup2
AGAINST STUDENTS.

00:59:39.509 --> 00:59:42.479 region:rollup2
YOUNG PEOPLE COME TO FEEL THAT

00:59:40.977 --> 00:59:43.947 region:rollup2
THEY'RE TREATED AS SUSPECTS

00:59:42.479 --> 00:59:44.748 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN STUDENTS

00:59:43.947 --> 00:59:46.416 region:rollup2
AND WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR

00:59:44.748 --> 00:59:47.617 region:rollup2
WAYS TO REDUCE THE PRESENCE OF

00:59:46.416 --> 00:59:48.752 region:rollup2
POLICE IN OUR SCHOOLS RATHER

00:59:47.617 --> 00:59:50.520 region:rollup2
THAN INCREASE AT.

00:59:48.752 --> 00:59:51.855 region:rollup2
I IN GENERAL WE THINK THAT THAT

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:53.690 region:rollup2
COUNSELORS MORE COUNSELORS IN

00:59:51.855 --> 00:59:55.459 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS IS A BETTER APPROACH TO

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:56.893 region:rollup2

I WE ARE NO FEDERAL LAW

01:17:52.201 --> 01:17:55.571 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY CLASSIFIES CANNABIS AS

01:17:53.469 --> 01:17:57.606 region:rollup2
A SCHEDULE ONE DRUG WHICH MAKES.

01:17:55.571 --> 01:17:59.275 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THOSE

01:17:57.606 --> 01:18:02.211 region:rollup2

OR USE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

01:18:02.211 --> 01:18:04.980 region:rollup2
