BECAUSE GOD FORBID SOMETHING

00:23:55.901 --> 00:23:57.936

GET FROM INFECTIONS THAT CAUSE

00:29:33.638 --> 00:29:35.440
HARM TO INDIVIDUALS AND IT'S

00:29:35.507 --> 00:29:36.441
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR

00:29:36.508 --> 00:29:37.609
INDIVIDUALS TO PROVIDE THE

00:29:37.675 --> 00:29:40.111

CARING AND IS THAT IT. AND

00:30:05.003 --> 00:30:11.509
WITHIN THAT ROOM OVER TODAY. IS

00:30:11.576 --> 00:30:12.810
THE SIXTEEN HOUR COURSE NOT

SANITATION. OTHER AREAS SO THAT

00:31:10.568 --> 00:31:12.637
SOUNDS LIKE BETWEEN TEN AND 20%

00:31:12.704 --> 00:31:15.006
OF THE EDUCATION WELL IT WOULD

00:31:15.073 --> 00:31:16.641

OF ME ON THAT BUT IT'S

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:42.560
DEFINITELY SOMETHING WE CAN

00:32:45.596 --> 00:32:46.631
THERE ANY PARTICULAR PLACE THAT

DEFINITELY. SEE LESS AND WE

00:32:56.974 --> 00:32:59.410
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS VERY HAS

00:32:59.477 --> 00:33:00.945
OF MUCH HIGHER POPULATION IN

00:33:01.012 --> 00:33:03.181
GENERAL SO WE DEFINITELY ARE

00:33:03.247 --> 00:33:05.717
SEEN MORE IN THE AND LOS

00:33:05.783 --> 00:33:07.385
ANGELES AREA BECAUSE WE HAVE SO

00:33:07.452 --> 00:33:09.654
MANY MORE SALONS IN THAT AREA

00:33:09.721 --> 00:33:11.322
AND WE DON'T SEE IT AS MUCH UP

00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:13.725
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT WE

00:33:13.791 --> 00:33:16.861
SEE IT. WE SEE IT AS WELL. SO I

00:33:16.928 --> 00:33:18.363
GUESS IT'S A LOT EASIER TO HAVE

00:33:18.429 --> 00:33:19.497
TO SEE IT AND ENFORCEMENT ISSUE

00:33:19.564 --> 00:33:20.998
WHEN SOMEONE PUTS A- GETS A

00:33:21.065 --> 00:33:22.767
BRICK AND MORTAR ESTABLISH AND

BUSINESS LICENSE OF SOME KIND.

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:27.939
RIGHT BUT BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE

00:33:28.005 --> 00:33:30.007
WHO PRACTICE THAT THEIR WORK IN

00:33:30.074 --> 00:33:31.542
SOMEONE'S HOME THE HAVE ANY

00:33:31.609 --> 00:33:34.779
SENSE OF FAT. HOW BIG OF AN

00:33:34.846 --> 00:33:35.313
ISSUE IT IS. THAT THAT I'M

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:41.619
LICENSE ACTIVITY. WE MIGHT BE

00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:42.253
ABLE WE MIGHT HAVE DATA ON THAT

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:46.090
BECAUSE WE DO. GET COMPLAINTS

00:33:46.157 --> 00:33:49.193
ABOUT AND LICENSE ACTIVITY IN

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:52.263
AREAS OTHER THAN SALONS AND WE

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:53.731
DO HAVE THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE

00:33:53.798 --> 00:33:55.900
TO HAVE HOMES THE ONES AS WELL

00:33:55.967 --> 00:33:58.803
SO THERE WE DO HAVE QUITE A

00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:59.871
QUITE A FEW IN CALIFORNIA

00:33:59.937 --> 00:34:02.240
PEOPLE WHO HAVE. SORT OF

TRANSITION PART OF THEIR HOME

00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:05.176
INTO A SALON WHICH IS TOTALLY

00:34:05.243 --> 00:34:07.512
ACCEPTABLE AND SO WE HAVE HOME

00:34:07.578 --> 00:34:09.180
SALONS THAT ARE LEGITIMATE AS

00:34:09.247 --> 00:34:11.282
AS WELL BUT I DON'T HAVE THE

ELEVEN THOUSAND INSPECTIONS WE

00:35:00.932 --> 00:35:03.367
HAVE TWENTY FIVE INSPECTORS AND

00:35:03.434 --> 00:35:05.903
THAT TO COVER ABOUT FORTY SIX

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:08.072
THOUSAND A MONTH HAVE THOSE

00:35:08.139 --> 00:35:09.207
ELEVEN THOUSAND INSPECTIONS

00:35:16.848 --> 00:35:17.849
THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING IN

00:35:17.915 --> 00:35:19.217
OUR SYSTEM THAT WE COULD PULL

00:35:19.283 --> 00:35:20.551
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A LOT

00:35:20.618 --> 00:35:21.752
EASIER ONCE AGAIN TO GO AFTER

00:35:21.819 --> 00:35:26.057
IT ESTABLISHMENTS BUT AT. E. L.

00:35:26.123 --> 00:35:29.060
EIGHT. I'M TRYING TO GET MY

00:35:29.126 --> 00:35:30.561
HANDS OUT OF THE ON LICENSE

00:35:30.628 --> 00:35:31.195

00:35:31.262 --> 00:35:32.797
ANY. AGAIN IS THE INSPECTIONS A

00:35:32.864 --> 00:35:34.098
DATA POINT TO LOOK AT IN TERMS

00:35:34.165 --> 00:35:40.605
OF. LICENSE BUSINESSES. WHEN

00:35:40.671 --> 00:35:42.507
OUR INSPECTORS DO GO OUT THEY

00:35:42.573 --> 00:35:44.742
KIND OF FOCUS ON AN AREA SO IF

00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:46.811
AN INSPECTOR GOES OUT TO A

00:35:46.878 --> 00:35:48.679
SPECIFIC LOCATION THEY'LL

00:35:48.746 --> 00:35:51.382
USUALLY TRY TO COVER ANYTHING

00:35:51.449 --> 00:35:52.750
CLOSE IN THAT AREA SO THAT'S

00:35:52.817 --> 00:35:53.985
WHERE WE WOULD FIND SOME

00:35:54.051 --> 00:35:57.221
UNLICENSED ACTIVITY IF WE FIND

00:35:57.288 --> 00:35:59.557
AN UNLICENSED ESTABLISHMENT. M.

00:35:59.624 --> 00:36:01.859
AND AGAIN WE WOULD DEFINITELY

00:36:01.926 --> 00:36:02.426
HAVE THOSE NUMBERS IN OUR IN

00:36:02.493 --> 00:36:05.096
OUR SYSTEM THAT WE COULD PULL.

00:36:05.162 --> 00:36:07.465

00:36:07.532 --> 00:36:08.232
MEAN I'M TRYING TO GET A HANDLE

00:36:08.299 --> 00:36:09.700
ON IT I HOPE THAT YOU GUYS

00:36:09.767 --> 00:36:10.768
COULD I GET A HAND HOW BIG OF A

00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:12.436
PROBLEM IS IT. YEAH WE CAN TALK

00:36:12.503 --> 00:36:14.338
ABOUT THE CANNABIS WORLD AND

00:36:14.405 --> 00:36:16.140
TALK ABOUT THE LICENSE CANNABIS

00:36:16.207 --> 00:36:17.942
WORLD IN THE UNLICENSED CAB GET

00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:19.911
OUT OF THIS WORLD. AND HOW BIG

00:36:19.977 --> 00:36:21.879
OF A SUCCESS OR FAILURE WERE

00:36:21.946 --> 00:36:22.480
HAVING IN GETTING WITHIN THE

00:36:22.547 --> 00:36:25.049
LICENSE SPACE. I'D BE GOOD IF

00:36:25.116 --> 00:36:26.918

00:36:26.984 --> 00:36:28.753
ENSURE THAT WITH US HOW BIG OF

00:36:28.819 --> 00:36:30.388
A PROBLEM IS IT. OF PEOPLE

00:36:30.454 --> 00:36:32.590
OPERATING WITHOUT A LICENSE.

00:36:32.657 --> 00:36:36.861
AND HOW ARE THEY DOING IT. AND

00:36:36.928 --> 00:36:38.229
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO I THINK

00:36:38.296 --> 00:36:40.231
TO US. EARLIER YOU TALKED ABOUT

00:36:40.298 --> 00:36:42.633

PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES AND YOU

00:36:45.102 --> 00:36:46.203
MENTION PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:47.872
AND YOU SPEND SOMETIME TALKING

00:36:47.939 --> 00:36:50.174
IMPORTANTLY ABOUT. PRIVATE

00:36:50.241 --> 00:36:51.309
INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE

EXPLOITED THEY'RE WORKING AT IT

00:36:52.877 --> 00:36:54.245
IN FACT IF THE WORK TO CLOSE

00:36:54.312 --> 00:36:56.213
THEM DOWN DO YOU HAVE ANY

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:56.781
BREAKDOWN AS TO HOW MUCH OF

THAT. TRAINING IS DONE BETWEEN

00:37:16.467 --> 00:37:18.302
THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT IF THE

00:37:18.369 --> 00:37:20.605
STUDENT CAN GET THAT TYPE OF

00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:21.105
TRAINING AT A COMMUNITY

00:37:21.172 --> 00:37:22.840
COLLEGES ARE GONNA SAY THE HECK

00:37:22.907 --> 00:37:24.609

00:37:25.977 --> 00:37:28.112
BETTER EDUCATION. WHAT WORK IS

00:37:28.179 --> 00:37:29.981
THE BOARD DOWN TO ENCOURAGE THE

00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:34.986
INSTITUTIONS TO. BE MORE ACTIVE

00:37:35.052 --> 00:37:35.586
IN AND THIS TYPE OF EDUCATION

00:37:35.653 --> 00:37:40.057
WORK. WE HAVEN'T NECESSARILY

00:37:40.124 --> 00:37:40.958
WORKED WITH THE COMMUNITY

00:37:41.025 --> 00:37:43.561
COLLEGES THAT DON'T OFFER THE

00:37:43.628 --> 00:37:45.229
COSMETOLOGY PROGRAM WE'VE

00:37:45.296 --> 00:37:45.830
WORKED WITH THE ONES THAT THAT

00:37:45.896 --> 00:37:49.200
DO. BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE ANY

00:37:49.266 --> 00:37:51.535
OUTRAGE TO OTHER CAN COMMUNITY

00:37:51.602 --> 00:37:52.670
COLLEGES THAT ARE NOT OFFERING

00:37:52.737 --> 00:37:54.605
THAT THE PROGRAMS IT SOUNDS

00:37:54.672 --> 00:37:56.073
LIKE AS YOU DESCRIBE IT THAT

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:57.708
OUR OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS

00:37:57.775 --> 00:38:00.011
PROVIDE LESS THAN 10% MAYBE

00:38:00.077 --> 00:38:01.779
EVEN FIVE PERCENT. OF THE

00:38:01.846 --> 00:38:04.548
TRAINING IN THIS AREA SUCH A

00:38:04.615 --> 00:38:05.182
REASONABLE RIGHT INCLUSION FROM

00:38:05.249 --> 00:38:08.052
WHAT SHE SAID. AND YET YOU HAVE

00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:09.587
SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND

LICENSEES. SALADA PEOPLE

00:38:10.821 --> 00:38:14.325
WORKING IN THE SPACE. IT SEEMS

00:38:14.392 --> 00:38:16.060
THAT IF WE HAVE A MUTUAL

00:38:16.127 --> 00:38:17.595
INTEREST MAKING SURE PEOPLE ARE

00:38:17.662 --> 00:38:18.996
TRAINED RIGHT AND YOU TALKED

00:38:19.063 --> 00:38:21.065
ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF THE

00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:21.632
PROBLEMS YOU ENCOUNTER WITH

00:38:21.699 --> 00:38:22.900
SCHOOLS THAT ARE DOING IT RIGHT.

00:38:22.967 --> 00:38:24.735
AND WE HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN

00:38:24.802 --> 00:38:26.804
OUR PBLIC INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE

00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:27.371
WE HAVE SOME AUTHORITY OVER

00:38:27.438 --> 00:38:30.107
WHAT THEY DO. AND WHEN PEOPLE

00:38:30.174 --> 00:38:31.509
TALK TO BE ABOUT HOW DO WE GET

00:38:31.575 --> 00:38:33.144
OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM TO BE MORE

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:35.079
RESPONSIVE TO WHAT PEOPLE WANT

00:38:35.146 --> 00:38:36.614
TO DO AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT

00:38:36.681 --> 00:38:40.718
THEY MAY SEE. ECONOMICALLY JUST

00:38:40.785 --> 00:38:41.252
SEEMS LIKE MAYBE THIS IS A

00:38:41.318 --> 00:38:41.819
SPACE THAT WE SHOULD BE MORE

00:38:41.886 --> 00:38:44.288
ACTIVE THAN. MAYBE THAT'S

00:38:44.355 --> 00:38:46.323
SOMETHING WE CAN ABOUT FURTHER.

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:47.158

CERTAINLY IN THE IN THE BARBARY

00:39:03.474 --> 00:39:06.277
AND COSMETOLOGY FEEL GIVEN HOW

00:39:06.343 --> 00:39:07.878

00:39:07.945 --> 00:39:10.815
LIKE. WE MAYBE IF WE MAY. WE

00:39:10.881 --> 00:39:11.916
MAY BE FALLING SHORT I'D LOVE

00:39:11.982 --> 00:39:13.150
TO HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSION. ON

00:39:13.217 --> 00:39:15.186
THAT. YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T

00:39:15.252 --> 00:39:16.987

00:39:22.059 --> 00:39:24.562
TWO CUPS TATTOOS. I DON'T

00:39:24.628 --> 00:39:25.162
BELIEVE THERE'S A DC A BOARD

00:39:25.229 --> 00:39:27.231
THAT COVERS TIED TO THE BELIEVE

00:39:27.298 --> 00:39:28.899
IT FALLS THAT LOOK ON LOCAL AND

00:39:28.966 --> 00:39:34.872
HEALTH DEPARTMENT. REALLY. WELL

00:39:34.939 --> 00:39:35.473
IT SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF

00:39:35.539 --> 00:39:39.376
A MANIPULATION OF SKIN. DEATH

00:39:39.443 --> 00:39:40.244
I'D BE INTERESTED IN ANY

THAT ISSUE FROM THE HEALTH AND

00:39:45.149 --> 00:39:49.353
SAFETY POINT OF VIEW. SO MAYBE

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:49.920

00:41:10.267 --> 00:41:10.901
HUNDRED HOURS THERE ARE SOME

00:41:10.968 --> 00:41:12.803

UPHEAVAL COMING FROM SACRAMENTO

PRACTICE IT AND AS OUR INDUSTRY

00:51:42.566 --> 00:51:45.035
IT'S PRACTICE DID. SINCE TIME

00:51:45.101 --> 00:51:49.739
IMMEMORIAL. BECAUSE AB FIFTEEN

00:51:49.806 --> 00:51:50.674
THIRTEEN CLARIFIES THAT IF YOU

PRODUCT OR SERVICES YOU CANNOT

00:51:55.979 --> 00:51:59.850
RECEIVE COMMISSIONS. AND AB

00:51:59.916 --> 00:52:00.484
FIFTEEN THIRTEEN FIVE YEARS AGO

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:02.586
CREATED A PIECE RATE STRUCTURE

00:52:02.652 --> 00:52:05.055
WHICH IS VERY COMPLICATED TO

00:52:05.121 --> 00:52:06.923
IMPLEMENT IN A SALON SETTING

00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:08.124
ESSENTIALLY EVERYONE OF OUR

00:52:08.191 --> 00:52:09.926
STYLIST HAS TO CHECK IN AND

00:52:09.993 --> 00:52:10.760

PROVIDING ACTIVE SERVICE.

00:52:16.032 --> 00:52:18.401
BECAUSE THE INTENT OF AB

00:52:18.468 --> 00:52:19.202
FIFTEEN THIRTEEN WAS TO MAKE

00:52:19.269 --> 00:52:22.539
SURE. THAT FOR SO LONG

00:52:22.606 --> 00:52:24.941
INDIVIDUAL STYLIST RECEIVING A

PIECE OF THEIR SERVICES. IN

00:52:28.545 --> 00:52:30.046
TERMS OF PAY. THAT THEY WOULD

00:52:30.113 --> 00:52:33.650
NOT BE HARMED FOR IT LEGAL

00:52:33.717 --> 00:52:36.419
BREAKS OR WE SEE THE SAME

00:52:36.486 --> 00:52:37.487
COMMENSURATE PAY WHEN THEY'RE

00:52:37.554 --> 00:52:39.890
NOT ACTUALLY DOING A SERVICE

00:52:39.956 --> 00:52:43.059
BUT STILL UNDER THE EMPLOYEE

00:52:43.126 --> 00:52:43.593
AND CONTROLLED THEIR SALON

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:48.198
OWNER. THAT HAS BEEN A VERY BIG

00:52:48.265 --> 00:52:49.866
MUCH FOR EMPLOYER BASED SALONS.

00:52:49.933 --> 00:52:53.136
HOWEVER AT LEAST THREE QUARTERS

00:52:53.203 --> 00:52:54.504

BASED THEIR BOOTH RENTAL OR

00:52:56.506 --> 00:52:59.376
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. SO THEY

00:52:59.442 --> 00:53:01.878
A SKATE THE RECENT UPHEAVAL

00:53:01.945 --> 00:53:03.780
REGARDING THE LACK OF BEING

00:53:03.847 --> 00:53:07.083

00:53:35.011 --> 00:53:39.082
STATUTE. EVENTUALLY THE STATE

00:53:39.149 --> 00:53:40.750
REGULATORS WILL START ENFORCING

00:53:40.817 --> 00:53:43.019

EARLIER THREE QUARTERS OF OUR

00:53:54.898 --> 00:53:57.467
SALONS. UTILIZED TRAINERS SO

00:53:57.534 --> 00:54:01.805

EVEN MORE DRAMATIC REFORMS ARE

00:54:12.882 --> 00:54:16.686
WAY. THE STATE BOARD IS YOU

00:54:16.753 --> 00:54:19.489
HEARD ENGAGING WITH INDUSTRY

00:54:19.556 --> 00:54:22.592

00:54:22.659 --> 00:54:26.196
MANNER RESPONSIBLE MEANS

00:54:33.803 --> 00:54:36.106
FOR OUR INDUSTRY HOW DO YOU

00:54:36.172 --> 00:54:39.109
MAINTAIN PLAYABILITY CURRENTS

00:54:39.175 --> 00:54:40.944
FOR EXAMPLE AND VERY FIRST

00:54:41.011 --> 00:54:43.013
TUMORS WHEN THE SERVICES AREN'T

00:54:43.079 --> 00:54:47.450
EVEN BEING DONE IN A LICENSED

00:54:47.517 --> 00:54:47.984
ESTABLISHMENT THAT CAN BE

00:54:48.051 --> 00:54:50.120
INSPECTED. INSPECTORS

00:54:50.186 --> 00:54:54.591

00:54:54.658 --> 00:54:56.226
LIABILITY INSURANCE IS ACTUALLY

00:54:56.292 --> 00:54:59.663
INCLUDED IN THE REGULATORY

00:54:59.729 --> 00:55:00.263

SERVICES OUTSIDE OF BRICK AND

00:55:10.206 --> 00:55:13.710
MORTAR AND SO AT THE VERY LEAST

00:55:13.777 --> 00:55:14.711
THEY COULD REQUIRE THEM TO HAVE

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:17.947
PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY

00:56:28.885 --> 00:56:31.621
THEY STAND FOR AND I THINK THAT

00:56:31.688 --> 00:56:33.590
IN AND OF ITSELF HAS BEEN A

00:56:33.656 --> 00:56:35.558
PIVOTAL IN CHANGING THE MAKEUP

00:56:35.625 --> 00:56:36.726

WAITING EQUALLY LONG. JUST TO

00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:56.679

00:58:11.754 --> 00:58:12.755
HUNDRED DIFFERENT EXAMPLES OF

00:58:12.822 --> 00:58:15.658
WHAT I'D SAY HAVE BEEN

00:58:15.725 --> 00:58:16.292
SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS BY THE STATE

00:58:16.359 --> 00:58:19.796

00:58:25.935 --> 00:58:27.904
AB HELPFUL WAY LET'S JUST PUT

00:58:27.971 --> 00:58:29.639
IT THAT WAY SO WE'VE BEEN VERY

00:58:29.706 --> 00:58:32.008
GRATEFUL FOR MARK ASSOCIATIONS

00:58:32.075 --> 00:58:33.276
VANTAGE POINT OF OUR STATE

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:40.216
CLIENTELE. I DO WNT TO HIT

UPON BARRIERS TO ENTRY I KNOW

00:58:42.051 --> 00:58:44.520
THAT'S BEEN A CONCERN SB NINE

00:58:44.587 --> 00:58:45.822
NINE NINE WAS INTRODUCED LAST

00:58:45.889 --> 00:58:48.224
YEAR SENATOR NGUYEN HAD THE

00:58:48.291 --> 00:58:50.560
BILL THE YEAR BEFORE THAT OTHER

00:58:50.627 --> 00:58:52.795
STATES ARE LOOKING AT CHIPPING

00:58:52.862 --> 00:58:54.631
AWAY AT LICENSE SCOPE OF

00:58:54.697 --> 00:58:57.967
PRACTICE SUMMER BY THE WAY JUST

00:58:58.034 --> 00:58:58.601
TRYING TO OBLITERATE. LICENSING

00:58:58.668 --> 00:59:03.873
ALTOGETHER. THAT MOVEMENT IS A

00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:04.807
LIBERTARIAN MOVEMENT AGAINST

00:59:04.874 --> 00:59:06.976
VOCATIONAL LICENSING THEY'VE

00:59:07.043 --> 00:59:09.913
LOOKED YOU KNOW SINCE NINETEEN

00:59:09.979 --> 00:59:11.314
SIXTY FIVE IT USED TO BE LESS

00:59:11.381 --> 00:59:13.416
THAN 10% OF THE WORKFORCE WAS

00:59:13.483 --> 00:59:15.818
LICENSED NOW IT'S PUSHING ONE

00:59:15.885 --> 00:59:18.488
THIRD AND SO THE LIBERTARIAN

00:59:18.554 --> 00:59:19.923
STRING SAYS THERE'S SOMETHING

00:59:19.989 --> 00:59:21.658
WRONG WITH THAT WHY IS

00:59:21.724 --> 00:59:22.926
GOVERNMENT HAVING TO GET IN THE

00:59:22.992 --> 00:59:24.661
WAY OF YOU MAKING A LIVING. TO

COTTON MEMBERS TO LOOK AT THAT

00:59:29.599 --> 00:59:31.734
HISTORY IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:59:31.801 --> 00:59:32.802
HISTORY OF PRIVATE SECTOR

00:59:32.869 --> 00:59:35.638
UNIONIZATION. IT'S BEEN EXACTLY

00:59:35.705 --> 00:59:38.107
AN INVERSE INVERSE PROPORTIONAL

00:59:38.174 --> 00:59:39.742
RELATIONSHIP WITH LICENSING IN

00:59:39.809 --> 00:59:42.545
OTHER WORDS. AS UNIONS IN THE

00:59:42.612 --> 00:59:44.681
PRIVATE SECTOR HAVE DECLINED

00:59:44.747 --> 00:59:45.248
MEMBERSHIP IN PERCENTAGE OF

OVERALL WORK FORCE. LICENSING

00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:52.188
HAS FILLED THE GAP AS IT WERE.

00:59:52.255 --> 00:59:53.890
UNIONS USED TO MAINTAIN A LOT

00:59:53.957 --> 00:59:56.059
OF THE STANDARDS IN THESE

00:59:56.125 --> 00:59:56.559

SETTER. AS THEY HAVE ATROPHIED

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:03.866
GOVERNMENT HAS FILLED THE VOID

01:00:03.933 --> 01:00:04.968
TO MAINTAIN PROFESSIONAL

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:06.769
STANDARDS I THINK IT'S AN

01:00:06.836 --> 01:00:07.804
INTERESTING INVERSE

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:10.673

DECREASING LICENSE SCOPE OF

01:00:21.384 --> 01:00:23.553
PATHWAYS TO ENTERING THIS

01:00:23.619 --> 01:00:25.755
INDUSTRY YOU HAD A BACK AND

01:00:25.822 --> 01:00:26.255
FORTH ABOUT PRIVATE POST

01:00:26.322 --> 01:00:28.992
SECONDARY SCHOOLS. WELL THERE'S

01:00:29.058 --> 01:00:31.861
A PRINT SHIPS AFTER THIRTY NINE

01:00:31.928 --> 01:00:32.295
HOURS OF THEORETICAL

01:00:32.362 --> 01:00:35.131
INSTRUCTION. YOU CAN

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:37.400
IMMEDIATELY GO TO WORK EARNING

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:39.669
WHILE YOU'RE LEARNING AS AN

01:00:39.736 --> 01:00:41.738
APPRENTICE IN THIS INDUSTRY

01:00:41.804 --> 01:00:43.473
THIRTY NINE HOURS HIS WORK.

01:00:43.539 --> 01:00:45.708
THERE CAPPED AT TWENTY FIVE

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:46.342
HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THE TWENTY

01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:47.110
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TOTAL AN

01:00:47.176 --> 01:00:48.845
APPRENTICE CANNOT BE CHARGED

01:00:48.911 --> 01:00:51.280
MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED

DOLLARS BY THEIR PROGRAM

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:55.518
SPONSOR OR ANYBODY. SO THERE IS

01:00:55.585 --> 01:00:58.554
ONE AVENUE FOR LICENSE.

01:00:58.621 --> 01:01:00.923
MOREOVER MY ASSOCIATION CREATED

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:04.660
AN EXTERNSHIP PROGRAM AFTER 60%

CALLED EXTERNAL. YOU CAN'T BE

01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:17.540

01:01:17.607 --> 01:01:19.342
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE PAID

01:01:19.409 --> 01:01:20.676
SO YOU AGAIN YOU CAN EARN WHILE

YOU LEARN THE APPRENTICE ONLY

01:01:23.446 --> 01:01:23.980
HAD THIRTY NINE HOURS. AND CAN

01:01:24.047 --> 01:01:28.684
BE PAID. IF SOMEONE TED NINE

01:01:28.751 --> 01:01:29.252
HUNDRED HOURS OF INSTRUCTION

01:01:29.318 --> 01:01:31.888
WHY CAN'T THEY ALSO BE PAID.

01:01:31.954 --> 01:01:34.524
THEY CAN ALSO RECEIVE CLOCK OUR

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:35.091
CREDIT FOR THE TIME THAT THE

01:01:35.158 --> 01:01:38.694
SERVICE AN EXTRA. SO THERE ARE

01:01:38.761 --> 01:01:40.530
OTHER MEANS OF REDUCING THAT

01:01:40.596 --> 01:01:45.101
BARRIER TO ENTRY. AND BY THE

01:01:45.168 --> 01:01:46.969
WAY WE ARE ONE OF THE FEW

01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:49.439
STATES OF THE FIFTY STATES BUT

01:01:49.505 --> 01:01:51.808
DON'T JUST HAVE RECIPROCITY WE

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:52.942
HAVE WHAT'S CALLED LICENSE YOUR

01:01:53.009 --> 01:01:55.378

CALIFORNIA NO QUESTIONS ASKED

01:02:02.752 --> 01:02:04.987
ESSENTIALLY AS LONG AS YOU

LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE

01:02:11.694 --> 01:02:14.097
THE MOST GENEROUS WELCOMING

01:02:14.163 --> 01:02:16.532
RECIPROCITY BECAUSE WE DON'T

01:02:16.599 --> 01:02:18.267
CARE WHETHER NEW YORK ACCEPTS

01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:20.536

01:02:20.603 --> 01:02:21.170
WILLING TO ACCEPT THEM INTO OUR

01:02:21.237 --> 01:02:26.442
STATE. THE STATE BOARD MEMBERS

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:28.845
MENTION THIS ARTIST HIGHLIGHTED.

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:31.981
REGARDING CLOCK OUR CREDIT. THE

01:02:32.048 --> 01:02:34.217
SINGLE LARGEST NUMBER OF

CONSUMER HARM COMPLAINTS

01:02:37.019 --> 01:02:39.455
HAPPENS IN THE ONE SECTOR OF

01:02:39.522 --> 01:02:41.324
OUR INDUSTRY THAT HAS THE LEAST

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:41.858
AMOUNT OF FORMAL EDUCATION

01:02:41.924 --> 01:02:44.927

VIOLATIONS. ARE IN MANY CURRENT

01:02:50.533 --> 01:02:55.505
SALONS. SO I THINK THERE IS A

01:02:55.571 --> 01:02:56.105
CORRELATION BETWEEN THOSE TWO

01:02:56.172 --> 01:03:01.878

ALTERNATIVE TO CLOCK HOUR. NOT

01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:25.935
NECESSARILY TO REPLACE BECAUSE

01:03:26.002 --> 01:03:27.603
AGAIN THAT WOULD COST SUCH UP

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:30.106
PEOPLE ARE SCHOOL SECTOR BUT

01:03:30.173 --> 01:03:31.841

PARTICULAR STUDENTS ARE

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.663
COMPETENT IN THOSE PROTOCOLS

01:03:53.729 --> 01:03:56.499
AND MOVE THEM ALONG FASTER SO

01:03:56.566 --> 01:03:57.767
THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE THERE FOR

01:03:57.833 --> 01:03:59.869
TEN MONTHS. NOW I CAUTION SOME
