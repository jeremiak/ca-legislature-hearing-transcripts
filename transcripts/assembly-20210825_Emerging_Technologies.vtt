AND EARLY APPLICATIONS OF FIVE

00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:59.938
G. AT ITS HIGHEST BAND WITH

00:29:00.004 --> 00:29:01.773

IS ABLE TO HAPPEN

00:29:26.631 --> 00:29:28.266
INSTANTANEOUSLY BETWEEN

PRIVATE SECTORS OF COME ABOUT.

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:07.759
BECAUSE OF THE SLACKNESS

COMMUNICATION NETWORKS BUT SO

00:32:09.193 --> 00:32:12.530
MUCH STARTED OFF AS- A SIMPLE

00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:14.198
CALIFORNIA SERVICE. GREW UP

00:32:14.265 --> 00:32:17.135
INTO. THREE G. WHICH BROUGHT US

YEARS YOU HAVE REALLY MOVED ON-

00:32:25.843 --> 00:32:28.413
AND SEEN A TRANSFORMATION BY

00:32:28.479 --> 00:32:31.015
THE ADVENT OF. SMART PHONES

00:32:31.082 --> 00:32:33.985
WHICH ARE USED THAT. ARE

00:32:34.052 --> 00:32:35.219
PRESENT HIGH SPEED

00:32:35.286 --> 00:32:36.888
COMMUNICATION NETWORKS A DEEP

00:32:36.954 --> 00:32:38.756
CUTS AFFECT US FOR G.

00:32:38.823 --> 00:32:40.958
UNLEASHING A RANGE OF SERVICES

00:32:41.025 --> 00:32:43.294

THAT DIDN'T EXIST JUST ADVOCATE

00:32:46.698 --> 00:32:48.232
RIGHT SO THIS IS THE FAULT OF

00:32:48.299 --> 00:32:50.301
CONSUMMATION. THAT WIRELESS

00:32:50.368 --> 00:32:52.704
CONNECTIVITY AS DELIVERED AND

IT'S NOT JUST WITHIN THE US

00:32:54.238 --> 00:32:56.741
GLOBAL GLOBAL CONSUMMATION OF

ESPECIALLY WIRELESS BOXES

00:33:13.291 --> 00:33:15.626
BECAUSE- THAT IS A- VERY VERY

00:33:15.693 --> 00:33:17.395
VERY MUCH 99% OF PEOPLE I'LL

00:33:17.462 --> 00:33:19.263
LEARN TO USE THE INTERNET. EVEN

THE DEMAND FOR FOSSIL COMMITTEE

00:33:50.294 --> 00:33:51.929
THIS NOT GONNA GO ALL RIGHT AND

00:33:51.996 --> 00:33:53.831
THIS IS ALL GOING WHAT I

00:33:53.898 --> 00:33:54.932

AND IT IS GOING TO BRING US

00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:23.261
SPEED IT IS GOING BRING A MUCH

00:34:23.327 --> 00:34:25.696
LOWER LATE MY ACCOUNT OF

DEVICES THAT YOU NORMALLY

00:34:40.144 --> 00:34:41.245
WOULDN'T THINK OF USING A

00:34:41.312 --> 00:34:43.214
NETWORK BUT ALL OF THESE ARE

00:34:43.281 --> 00:34:44.615
GOING TO BE CONNECTED. AND THAT

00:34:44.682 --> 00:34:46.884
ENTIRE ECOSYSTEMS GOING TO

00:34:46.951 --> 00:34:49.987
CHANGE HOW WE ALL ARE GONNA GET

00:34:50.054 --> 00:34:51.088
ARTICLES VERY MANIFESTING IN

00:34:51.155 --> 00:34:53.157
CYBER SECURITY IS GOING TO BE-

00:34:53.224 --> 00:34:55.493
EVOLVE EVOLVING OVER TIME.

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:59.163
RIGHT NOW AT THE KEY PART FOR

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:01.699
MANY OF YOU ARTICLES AUDIENCE

TO LEAD TO START TRANSFORMATION

00:35:08.139 --> 00:35:09.941
THE DIFFERENT SECTORS. BUT ONE

00:35:10.007 --> 00:35:11.142
OF THE KEY PLAYERS AND IT IS

00:35:11.209 --> 00:35:12.777
GOING TO HAPPEN. IS BECAUSE

00:35:12.844 --> 00:35:14.378
FIGHT IN THE COURTS ARE GOING

00:35:14.445 --> 00:35:27.125
TO COST. LOWER IN ORDER TO GET

BY THE BRITISH WIRELESS

00:35:28.192 --> 00:35:29.694
NETWORKS MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:33.965
BALLOT SHIFT IN HOW THESE OF

00:35:34.031 --> 00:35:34.532
UNDERHOOKS I'M GOING FORWARD

ESTATE FUEL THAT HAD TO GET

00:35:41.472 --> 00:35:43.107
THESE COST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:35:43.174 --> 00:35:44.609
AND THIS WOULD INCREASE COST OF

00:35:44.675 --> 00:35:46.177
DEPLOYING A INTERNET AND IF I

00:35:46.244 --> 00:35:48.579
MANY ALL WOULD NOT A GOOD THE

00:35:48.646 --> 00:35:50.381

COMPONENTS FOR CREATING THE

00:56:15.805 --> 00:56:17.373
FIVE G. NETWORKS AND THEREFORE

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:19.409
NEED NOT RELIGION AND I THINK

00:56:19.476 --> 00:56:20.376
THE FIVE G. INFRASTRUCTURE

ECONOMY. I WILL STOP HERE AND

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:24.914
HOPE THAT BIG THIS WAS

00:56:24.981 --> 00:56:26.916
INFORMATIVE AND THAT THERE WILL

00:56:26.983 --> 00:56:32.989
BE QUESTIONS FROM THE. ASSEMBLY

YOUR LET US NOW GO TO COURT YOU

00:56:35.358 --> 00:56:36.793
A BUT I INITIALLY THAT PART OF

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:40.263
MY INITIAL- REMARKS- WAS NOT

00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:41.998
PICKED UP BY THE AUDIO SO I'M

00:56:42.065 --> 00:56:43.767
GOING TO REPEAT SOME OF WHAT I

00:56:43.833 --> 00:56:47.303

00:56:52.242 --> 00:56:56.479
SEVEN. SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE

00:56:56.546 --> 00:56:57.113
FIVE SEVEN AND THE ACCESS CODE

00:56:57.180 --> 00:57:00.450
IS ONE THREE ONE FIVE FOUR

00:57:00.517 --> 00:57:02.051
THREE SEVEN. AGAIN THE PUBLIC

COMMENT LINE IS. 877-692-8957

00:57:07.357 --> 00:57:10.827
AND- SO WITH THAT LET'S OPEN UP

00:57:10.894 --> 00:57:13.062
THE QUEUE IN A- PORTION. I

00:57:13.129 --> 00:57:15.198
THINK THAT THE INFORMATION HAS

00:57:15.265 --> 00:57:17.700
BEEN VERY HELPFUL AND YOU KNOW

00:57:17.767 --> 00:57:19.636
IT PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO

00:57:19.702 --> 00:57:20.603
ONE OF THE EXAMPLES THAT THE

00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:23.039
PANEL IS. PROVIDED AND THAT

00:57:23.106 --> 00:57:24.707
NUMBER IS STAGGERING AND THE

00:57:24.774 --> 00:57:26.142
THESE EXAMPLE DAD THAT WAS

00:57:26.209 --> 00:57:28.211
GIVEN WAS THAT THE NUMBER OF A

00:57:28.278 --> 00:57:29.913
MOBILE DEVICES OR I'LL I'LL TWO

00:57:29.979 --> 00:57:32.849
DEVICES- IS GOING TO EXCEED.

00:57:32.916 --> 00:57:33.983
THE NUMBER OF HUMAN BEINGS ON

00:57:34.050 --> 00:57:36.052
THIS WORK ON THIS- EARTH AND-

00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:37.053
THAT NUMBER IS EXPECTED TO

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.688
TRIPLE IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS

00:57:38.755 --> 00:57:39.923
AND THAT THAT'S SO VERY

00:57:39.989 --> 00:57:41.958
STAGGERING NUMBER. SO THAT GOES

00:57:42.025 --> 00:57:44.460
TO SHOW HOW IMPORTANT- IT YOU

00:57:44.527 --> 00:57:46.029
KNOW IT IS TO FORCE TO BRICK

00:57:46.095 --> 00:57:47.864
BUILD A FRAMEWORK SO WITH THAT

00:57:47.931 --> 00:57:49.632
IN MIND I HAVE A COUPLE OF

00:57:49.699 --> 00:57:51.134
QUICK QUESTIONS FOR THE

00:57:51.201 --> 00:57:52.969
PANELISTS. FIRST QUESTION BEING

00:57:53.036 --> 00:57:55.004
THAT DUE TO THE PREDICTED

00:57:55.071 --> 00:57:57.740
ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS FORESHADOW

00:57:57.807 --> 00:57:59.776
A LINEARIZED IN ECONOMIC

00:57:59.843 --> 00:58:01.611
ACTIVITY OR IS IT MORE OF A

00:58:01.678 --> 00:58:07.951
CURVED. AND EVEN RICE ANY OF

00:58:08.017 --> 00:58:09.319
THE ANY OF THE PALACE SO FEEL

00:58:09.385 --> 00:58:13.223
FREE TO CHINA. DID YOU WANT TO

00:58:13.289 --> 00:58:19.095
THE POST AB I BELIEVE THAT WITH

00:58:19.162 --> 00:58:22.599
EVERY G. THE RISE IS NOT YOU

00:58:22.665 --> 00:58:26.069
SEE THAT EARLY ADOPTION IS NOT

00:58:26.135 --> 00:58:29.639
BE FREE BUT HAVE SKEPTICISM AND

00:58:29.706 --> 00:58:33.076
THAT IS SOME TENTS AND BUILDING

00:58:33.142 --> 00:58:35.445
OUT ACTORS THAT IS SOME

00:58:35.511 --> 00:58:37.814
BARRIERS TO- THE INITIAL EXAM

00:58:37.881 --> 00:58:39.716
COSTS BUT MONTHS SPENT EVERY

00:58:39.782 --> 00:58:41.251
GENERATION WE HAVE SEEN THIS

00:58:41.317 --> 00:58:45.755
ONCE THAT. OUT IN THE SHOWS

00:58:45.822 --> 00:58:47.590
TRUMP IS OVERCOME YOU SEE AN

00:58:47.657 --> 00:58:50.526
EXPONENTIAL RISE AND BULLETS

00:58:50.593 --> 00:58:51.594
THE INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

00:58:51.661 --> 00:58:53.062
DEVICES THAT HAVEN'T HAD

00:58:53.129 --> 00:58:55.832
MENTIONED INCREASED- SO MUCH

00:58:55.899 --> 00:58:57.567
THAT IT EXCEEDED THE BARD

00:58:57.634 --> 00:58:58.568
POPULATION IN THE LAST FEW

00:58:58.635 --> 00:59:02.305
YEARS JUST SMARTPHONES AND YEAH

00:59:02.372 --> 00:59:04.107
I KNEW IT WAS AND THEREFORE

00:59:04.173 --> 00:59:06.809
GROWTH I BELIEVE THAT BEARD TO

00:59:06.876 --> 00:59:08.878
SEE THE SAME THING THAT FIVE G.

00:59:08.945 --> 00:59:10.346
BUT I DOES WE HAVE NEVER SEEN

00:59:10.413 --> 00:59:12.248
BEFORE BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO

00:59:12.315 --> 00:59:16.219
TOUCH MANY MORE INDUSTRIES THAN

00:59:16.286 --> 00:59:19.322
ANY PREVIOUS GENERATION I WILL

00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:22.125
CALL WHAT. A CONTESTING AND I

00:59:22.191 --> 00:59:23.793
THINK THAT WHAT I SAID EARLIER

00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:25.962
ABOUT THE I DO NOT BEING A

00:59:26.029 --> 00:59:27.130
SINGLE STANDARD AT SOUTHERN

00:59:27.196 --> 00:59:28.564
UTAH ON THE SWITCH ON AND

00:59:28.631 --> 00:59:29.399
SEVENTY HAPPENS THE SAME PART

00:59:29.465 --> 00:59:32.268
OF PART OF THAT DESCRIPTION

00:59:32.335 --> 00:59:35.271
WHAT IS PART IS FIVE G. C.

00:59:35.338 --> 00:59:37.006
STANDARDS AND- HE'S TALKING

00:59:37.073 --> 00:59:39.842
SOMETHING FUTURE AND SOME

00:59:39.909 --> 00:59:41.277
FEATURES THAT ARE GOING TO. A

00:59:41.344 --> 00:59:44.247
NEW SENSE OF THAT BILL DOES

00:59:44.314 --> 00:59:47.517
FEATURES ARE ASSEMBLY ON THE

00:59:47.583 --> 00:59:50.153
AND I ARAMBULA TALK A LITTLE OF

00:59:50.219 --> 00:59:51.487
WATER IN THE NEXT SESSION BUT

00:59:51.554 --> 00:59:56.326
YOU KNOW THAT. LAYING ON OF

00:59:56.392 --> 00:59:59.529
HANDS RIGHT BEYOND WHAT NETFLIX

00:59:59.595 --> 01:00:00.430
BECAUSE OF THE POINT RIGHT ARE

01:00:00.496 --> 01:00:02.298
YOU VIDEOS WE DON'T KNOW DO YOU

01:00:02.365 --> 01:00:04.734
PLAY MORE OF THE BETTER SPEEDS

01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:05.668
YES YOU CAN CONNECT PEOPLE

01:00:05.735 --> 01:00:07.337
MIGHT BE CAN GET MORE WORK SO

01:00:07.403 --> 01:00:09.038
BUT IT DOES NEED TO IMMEDIATE

01:00:09.105 --> 01:00:10.073
BUT THE OTHER FEATURES OF FIVE

01:00:10.139 --> 01:00:12.742
G. THE DALLAS IN THE NEXT TO

01:00:12.809 --> 01:00:16.879
THREE STAND. DODD WILL NEED

01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:19.182
WHICH SO WHAT MAY SEE LIKE WHAT

01:00:19.248 --> 01:00:21.250
BE SETTING IT JUST YEAR'S

01:00:21.317 --> 01:00:22.318
THIRTY OR SOMETHING ELSE TO GO

01:00:22.385 --> 01:00:24.754
CONCERNED HUGE AND THEN WOULD

01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:26.456
BE COME ABOUT VENDORS

01:00:26.522 --> 01:00:27.423
APPLICATIONS ARE TESTED AND

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:29.959
VIDEO ON THE ROLE ENOUGH THAT

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:31.027
COULD SUDDENLY BECOME MUST

01:00:31.094 --> 01:00:33.963
MARKET RIGHT AND IT ALWAYS SO I

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:35.932
CAN GO TO THE DOCTOR ABOUT

01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:40.336
ACCESS AND DON'T FORGET NAY DO

01:00:40.403 --> 01:00:41.871
WE SEE GAINES GOING THE PARTS

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:44.340
OF SOCIETY EQUITY RIGHT TO DIE

01:00:44.407 --> 01:00:46.042
IS IMPORTANT PART BECAUSE I

01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:49.846
THINK THE BILL BIG FIVE G. IS

01:00:49.912 --> 01:00:51.047
TO THE COST OF BROAD IS GOING

01:00:51.114 --> 01:00:54.117
TO BE A PART OF THE MORE TO GO

01:00:54.183 --> 01:00:55.618
OVER SOME OF BROADBAND THE

01:00:55.685 --> 01:01:00.023
BAKER BE A EQUITY ARE INTENSE

01:01:00.089 --> 01:01:02.025
WANTS CHRISTMAS ALL SIX OF THE

01:01:02.091 --> 01:01:05.094
POPULATION HAVE TO SERVICE AND

01:01:05.161 --> 01:01:15.438
BUILD ON THIS GOING TO BE.

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:16.072
FIVE. THANK YOU VERY THE SECOND

01:01:16.139 --> 01:01:17.640
I TO DEAL SO SOMETHING THE PARA

01:01:17.707 --> 01:01:19.242
HAS STILL I TOUCHED ON A LITTLE

01:01:19.308 --> 01:01:20.376
BIT AND QUESTION BEING THAT

01:01:20.443 --> 01:01:22.211
WITH G. NOT K. OF VASTLY MORE

01:01:22.278 --> 01:01:23.479
MORE DATA THAN BEFORE HOW DO

01:01:23.546 --> 01:01:25.181
FIVE G. C. ENSURE THEY'RE SICK

01:01:25.248 --> 01:01:25.715
I THINK THAT MENTIONED THE

01:01:25.782 --> 01:01:27.950
PRIME ISSUE IS AN HAS BEEN

01:01:28.017 --> 01:01:29.585
CHALLENGING IT'S CHALLENGING

01:01:29.652 --> 01:01:31.554
ONE SO I'M WONDERING WHETHER

YOU COULD DOUBT YOU KNOW TOUCH

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:34.290
ON A LITTLE BIT EVEN MORE.

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:36.192
ABOUT SECURITY AS WELL AS

MAKE. SURE SO. I THINK ASPECTS

01:01:45.601 --> 01:01:46.936
TO SECURITY YEAH RIGHT WHEN WE

01:01:47.003 --> 01:01:49.172
TALK ABOUT. SECURING THE

01:01:49.238 --> 01:01:51.107
NETWORK MOST OF SECURING THE

01:01:51.174 --> 01:01:53.443
DATE. THANKS FOR THE NETWORK

01:01:53.509 --> 01:01:59.182
ITSELF IS THE PART THAT. MAKES.

01:01:59.248 --> 01:02:01.851
YOU IN PLACE ASIANS THE SERVER

01:02:01.918 --> 01:02:03.853
IN THE BACK OF RIGHT AND THAT

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.422
BACK AND FOR IS FORM SECURE AND

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:09.392
I THINK PART OF THE ART MANY

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:12.228
SECURITY OUT THAT HAVE BEEN IN

01:02:12.295 --> 01:02:13.763
PREVIOUS GENERATION OF NETWORK

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:15.498
AND WHAT FIVE G. HAS DONE IS TO

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:19.869
AGREE A MUCH ROBUST DESIGN.

01:02:19.936 --> 01:02:21.804
MULTIPLE OPTIONS TO ACHIEVE

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:25.007
REALLY DEBATE TITLED A SINGULAR

01:02:25.074 --> 01:02:26.309
SOME OF THOSE THINGS JOBS COME

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:29.612
A COST OF BUT FAR ENOUGH INTO

01:02:29.679 --> 01:02:33.483
IN THE US I USED NETWORK I

01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:34.917
THINK FIVE G. IS ONE THOSE CAN

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:36.786
THAT IS GOING BE MUCH MORE

01:02:36.853 --> 01:02:39.155
SECURE IS DEEPLY OPTICAL TO

01:02:39.222 --> 01:02:42.558
THOSE PLACE OPTION ANY GENDER

01:02:42.625 --> 01:02:44.794
MEDICAL GET SEEN WITH RIGHT NOW

01:02:44.861 --> 01:02:47.630
ALL THE BAR ABOUT WHAT THE DAY

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:49.699
SO THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE TO

01:02:49.765 --> 01:02:51.434
THANKS BYE IS WHY I WOULD THINK

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:54.070
ABOUT US POLICY REQUEST OUR

01:02:54.137 --> 01:02:57.607
PRIVACY OF DATA A HOW DO THESE

01:02:57.673 --> 01:03:00.143
STORE ARE SECURE THAT DATE IT

01:03:00.209 --> 01:03:01.611
MAY NOT HAVE ANYTHING THE NEXT

01:03:01.677 --> 01:03:04.147
ITSELF RIGHT AND MAYBE MORE OF

01:03:04.213 --> 01:03:06.082
WELL I DON'T THINK AND- PEOPLE

01:03:06.149 --> 01:03:08.885
LIKE IN THE GET ON OTHER SIDE

01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:09.685
SO THAT'S THE TYPE A DIFFERENT

01:03:09.752 --> 01:03:18.895
BUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:20.363
EARLIER WE LOOKED AT MAP OF ALL

01:03:20.429 --> 01:03:22.131
THIS IN IN THE IN THE COUNTRY

01:03:22.198 --> 01:03:23.266
ARE WHEN IT COMES TO DEPLOYMENT

01:03:23.332 --> 01:03:24.967
OF FIVE G. SO I GUESS THE

01:03:25.034 --> 01:03:27.303
QUESTION IS HOW DOES WELL I

01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:29.071
GUESS OF THE FIRST IS HOW HOW

IS THAT LACK OF BROADBAND ZERO

01:10:11.974 --> 01:10:15.778

01:12:14.730 --> 01:12:16.398
EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE. ENABLE ON

01:12:16.465 --> 01:12:18.901
THAT POINT. OR SOME OF THE

01:12:18.967 --> 01:12:21.470
COLLECTIVE CHANCE MIGHT BE TO

01:12:21.537 --> 01:12:23.906
SEE SIMILAR GAINS AGAIN.

01:12:23.972 --> 01:12:26.909
REGIONS THAT ARE EXTREMELY RUDE

01:12:26.975 --> 01:12:28.077
AND ALSO TRYING TO THE BEST SO

01:12:28.143 --> 01:12:29.611
FOR EXAMPLE. BE FUNDED A

01:12:29.678 --> 01:12:31.814
PROJECT OF CALIFORNIA SANTA

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:32.915
BARBARA WELL THE TRYING TO

01:12:32.981 --> 01:12:35.150
PROJECT WHICH TRIES TO BRING

01:12:35.217 --> 01:12:37.019
FOSTER ROBIN HOOD ACCESS USING

01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:39.088
A RANGE OF SPECTRUM BANDS THAT

01:12:39.154 --> 01:12:41.790
TRADITIONALLY ARE NOT USED. FOR

01:12:41.857 --> 01:12:43.659
OTHER REGULAR FOOD UNIT. RIGHT

01:12:43.726 --> 01:12:45.694
I THINK FIVE G. NETWORKS ARE

01:12:45.761 --> 01:12:47.329
GOING TO BE INCORPORATING MANY

01:12:47.396 --> 01:12:49.098
OF THOSE ASPECTS BOSTON

01:12:49.164 --> 01:12:50.499
SHEDDING USING WHITE SPACES

01:12:50.566 --> 01:12:53.235
AND- YOU KNOW OUR ADVICE AXLES

01:12:53.302 --> 01:12:55.070
SO IN THE NAME A FEW TO

01:12:55.137 --> 01:12:56.905
INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF SPECTRUM

01:12:56.972 --> 01:12:58.273
OF THEIR FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF

01:12:58.340 --> 01:12:59.274
DATA THAT CAN BE CARRIED ON THE

01:12:59.341 --> 01:13:11.787
STATE'S. ALL OF SARDO OF THE

01:13:11.854 --> 01:13:13.455
CHALLENGE IS DOUBLE WHAT HAS

01:13:13.522 --> 01:13:16.525
BEEN OF MORMON I MENTIONED THE

01:13:16.592 --> 01:13:18.994
BACKLOG THE NEXT LOCAL SO CAN

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:20.496
BE BACK OF THE NAY BOOK IT'S

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:22.898
CAN BE LETTER LINKS WE NEED IN

01:13:22.965 --> 01:13:24.933
TO ALLOW WHICH ON THAT ME RIGHT

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.902
SO ONE MAY I WHY DID TAKE SO

01:13:26.969 --> 01:13:29.505
LONG TO FIGURE TO GET THAT WHAT

01:13:29.571 --> 01:13:36.912
BACKHAUL WHAT NOT HAVE FOR G. I

01:13:36.979 --> 01:13:37.746
DON'T HAVE A GOOD. DAY BYE HE'S

01:13:37.813 --> 01:13:40.949
JUST MAKING A I G. B. ONE B.

01:13:41.016 --> 01:13:42.317
TWO THAT ARE MORE OPTIONS WE

01:13:42.384 --> 01:13:44.286
HAVE STAFF BEEN A BE A MINI

01:13:44.353 --> 01:13:49.992
THIS OPTIONS ARE COMING. SB

01:13:50.058 --> 01:13:51.293
GOING TO BE TESTING A RANGE OF

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:52.995
TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE GOING TO

01:13:53.061 --> 01:13:54.630
BE FOCUSING ON- STONES

01:13:54.696 --> 01:13:56.965
PRECISION AGRICULTURE- INPUT

01:13:57.032 --> 01:13:59.368
CROP AND LIVESTOCK. FARMS AND

01:13:59.434 --> 01:14:01.236
THEY'RE ALSO GOING TO BE

01:14:01.303 --> 01:14:03.105
LOOKING AT EDUCATION- OTHER

01:14:03.172 --> 01:14:05.674
OPTIONS IN THE WORLD YES. WHAT

01:14:05.741 --> 01:14:09.378
KIND OF ADVANCED AFFORDABLE

01:14:09.444 --> 01:14:10.245
BROADBAND OPTIONS THAT MAY HELP

01:14:10.312 --> 01:14:12.347
SO AND I THINK AS I MENTIONED

01:14:12.414 --> 01:14:15.250
BEFORE AN EMERGING USE SB

01:14:15.317 --> 01:14:16.218
SENATE HAS NOTHING LIKE THE

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:18.954
COLOR NO MATTER WHAT KIND USED

01:14:19.021 --> 01:14:20.689
AS WE COME UP WITH WE NEED TO

01:14:20.756 --> 01:14:23.492
MAKE SURE THAT IN THE EXTREME

01:14:23.559 --> 01:14:25.127
DISRUPTIVE BUT DOESN'T TAKE US

01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:27.729
ALL BACK TO THE STUDENTS RIGHT

01:14:27.796 --> 01:14:28.797
A LESSON THAT I REMEMBER

01:14:28.864 --> 01:14:29.765
DISTINCTLY FROM HOW TO

01:14:29.832 --> 01:14:32.201
CONSOLIDATE YOU HAVE CITY WAS

01:14:32.267 --> 01:14:35.737
IF YOU WHEN YOU LOST POWER. BUT

01:14:35.804 --> 01:14:38.774
THREE DAYS BEAVER HELLO AND

01:14:38.841 --> 01:14:40.209
THIS WAS LIKE CAN YEARS AGO AND

01:14:40.275 --> 01:14:41.844
NOT IN THE IMAGINE THAT

01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:43.545
HAPPENING TODAY AND THE STATE

01:14:43.612 --> 01:14:45.480
OF OUR OFFENSE MAY. BE ONE

01:14:45.547 --> 01:14:46.715
DOLLAR NETWORKS TO BE EXTENDING

01:14:46.782 --> 01:14:48.684
HIS LEAD AND THIS IS GOING TO

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:49.918
BE A CRITICAL PIECE OF A FIVE

01:14:49.985 --> 01:14:52.187
G. AND WHATEVER COMES NEXT. AND

01:14:52.254 --> 01:14:53.689
THE LAUNCH OF THE JUST LAUNCHED

01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:55.390
A NEW PROGRAM IN THE REGION

01:14:55.457 --> 01:14:57.125
NEXT EXISTENCE PROGRAM ALL

01:14:57.192 --> 01:14:59.328
GRAINS WHICH IS TRYING TO

01:14:59.394 --> 01:15:01.029
ISOLATE ASSAD'S WILL HELP MAKE

01:15:01.096 --> 01:15:02.865
OUR NETWORKS EXTREMELY

01:15:02.931 --> 01:15:04.633
EXTREMELY RELIABLE AND

AGO WHEN FOUR G. WAS IN ITS

01:19:30.966 --> 01:19:33.768
INFANCY PRIOR TO TEN YEARS AGO

01:19:33.835 --> 01:19:36.171
WHEN WE WERE STILL MAILING DVDS

01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:38.707
TO NETFLIX. OR AMAZON WAS JUST

01:19:38.773 --> 01:19:40.809
BEING BORN AS A COMPANY AS AN

FIVE G. IS GOING TO TAKE THAT

01:20:06.868 --> 01:20:09.271
TO THE NEXT LEVEL SO AND THE

01:20:09.337 --> 01:20:11.106
OTHER PART ABOUT FOUR G. IS THE

01:20:11.173 --> 01:20:14.209
CAPACITY OF FOUR G. NETWORKS IS

01:20:14.276 --> 01:20:16.478
LIMITED AND ITS CONSTRAINT. SO

01:20:16.545 --> 01:20:19.314
WHILE TODAY YOU CAN GET YOUR

01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:23.318
BROADBAND FROM LTE FOUR G. LTE

01:20:23.385 --> 01:20:24.352
THERE'S ONLY SO MANY LANES ON

01:20:24.419 --> 01:20:26.188
THE HIGHWAY RIGHT WHICH IS WHY

01:20:26.254 --> 01:20:27.756
WE NEED SMALL CELLS TO BUILD

01:20:27.822 --> 01:20:29.658
OUT THE CAPACITY ABOUT NETWORK

01:20:29.724 --> 01:20:31.293
AND BUILD MORE LANES TO THE

01:20:31.359 --> 01:20:33.562
FOUR G. LTE HIGHWAY. AS MORE

01:20:33.628 --> 01:20:34.896
AND MORE PEOPLE USE THEIR

01:20:34.963 --> 01:20:36.998
SMARTPHONES FOR VIRTUALLY

01:20:37.065 --> 01:20:39.167
EVERYTHING BUT STILL THERE ARE

01:20:39.234 --> 01:20:41.069
DATA CAPS THERE ARE LIMITS THAT

01:20:41.136 --> 01:20:42.270
THE NETWORK PROVIDERS HAVE TO

01:20:42.337 --> 01:20:44.506
PUT ON THE CAPACITY OF THAT

01:20:44.573 --> 01:20:46.007
NETWORK SO THAT IT WORKS FOR

01:20:46.074 --> 01:20:47.275
EVERYONE. CALLED NETWORK

01:20:47.342 --> 01:20:50.278
MANAGEMENT FIVE G. WHAT MAKES

01:20:50.345 --> 01:20:52.747
IT SO TRANSFORMATIONAL IS THE

01:20:52.814 --> 01:20:54.082
SPECTRUM AND I'M GONNA GO TO

01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:55.650
THE CURRENCIES THAT WERE USING

01:20:55.717 --> 01:20:57.919
PLASTIC FIBER TRANSPORT IT BACK

01:20:57.986 --> 01:20:59.588
CALL UPGRADES THAT ARE NEEDED.

01:20:59.654 --> 01:21:01.289
ARE GONNA MAKE THOSE DATA CAPS

01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:04.726
OF THING OF THE PAST. SO WITH

01:21:04.793 --> 01:21:06.861
FIVE G. EVERYONE'S ASKING RIGHT

01:21:06.928 --> 01:21:08.563
WHAT'S THE KILLER APP GOING TO

01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:09.731
BE FOR FIVE G. IS GOING TO BE

01:21:09.798 --> 01:21:11.333
SMART CITIES IS GONNA BE A. R.

01:21:11.399 --> 01:21:13.235
B. R. IS GOING TO BE. BE ME UP

01:21:13.301 --> 01:21:15.203
SCOTTY. IT'S GOING TO BE ALL OF

01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:17.072
THOSE THINGS BUT THE TRUE

01:21:17.138 --> 01:21:20.208
KILLER APP FOR RIGHT NOW IN

01:21:20.275 --> 01:21:22.677
TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN THIS TIME.

01:21:22.744 --> 01:21:24.913
IS BROADBAND FIVE G. IS GOING

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:27.415
TO DELIVER A THIRD HEIGHT IF

01:21:27.482 --> 01:21:30.051
YOU WILL. FOR HOME AND SMALL

01:21:30.118 --> 01:21:31.753
BUSINESS BROADBAND. IN

01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:34.189
COMPETITION WITH THE INCUMBENT

01:21:34.256 --> 01:21:34.723
TELEPHONE IN THE INCUMBENT

01:21:34.789 --> 01:21:37.259
CABLE COMPANIES. SO THAT'S

01:21:37.325 --> 01:21:38.927
THAT'S THE TRANSFORMATIONAL

01:21:38.994 --> 01:21:42.230
POWER OF FIVE G. AND THE REASON

01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:44.866
WHY IT'S A TRANSFORMATIONAL ARE

01:21:44.933 --> 01:21:46.501
BECAUSE OF WHAT WE CALL THE

01:21:46.568 --> 01:21:48.503
EIGHT CURRENCIES A FIVE YEAR

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:52.173
THE CAPABILITIES OF FIVE G. SO.

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:54.175
I YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY THAT

01:21:54.242 --> 01:21:55.277
THIS SPECTRUM WE'RE TALKING

01:21:55.343 --> 01:21:57.112
ABOUT MILLIMETER WAVE HIGH BAND

01:21:57.178 --> 01:21:58.980
SPECTRUM OF MID BAND SPECTRUM.

01:21:59.047 --> 01:22:01.182
IT'S NOT NEW WE HAVE BEEN

01:22:01.249 --> 01:22:06.421
USING- MICROWAVE TRANSPORT. FOR

01:22:06.488 --> 01:22:07.289
GENERATIONS AND

01:22:07.355 --> 01:22:09.758
TELECOMMUNICATIONS TO TRANSPORT

01:22:09.824 --> 01:22:11.693
LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA FROM ONE

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.428
POINT TO ANOTHER WHERE IT'S

01:22:13.495 --> 01:22:15.997
REALLY HARD TO BUILD FIBRE LIKE

01:22:16.064 --> 01:22:17.932
OUT IN OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES-

01:22:17.999 --> 01:22:20.302
ALONG. THREE NINETY FIVE- UP IN

01:22:20.368 --> 01:22:23.471
NOR CAL OR ALONG THE COAST- UP

01:22:23.538 --> 01:22:27.842
IN NOR CAL- BUT- AS A LAST MILE

01:22:27.909 --> 01:22:30.378
TECHNOLOGY THAT IS WHERE FIVE

01:22:30.445 --> 01:22:32.380
G. IS REALLY TRANSFORMATIONAL.

01:22:32.447 --> 01:22:33.782
SO THE SPECTRUM WE'RE TALKING

01:22:33.848 --> 01:22:36.284
ABOUT WITH FIVE G. BOTH THE MID

01:22:36.351 --> 01:22:38.219
BAND SPECTRUM. WHICH IS THE

01:22:38.286 --> 01:22:39.754
SUBTEXT GIGAHERTZ AND THEN THE

01:22:39.821 --> 01:22:41.156
HIGH BAND SPECTRUM THE

01:22:41.222 --> 01:22:43.358
MILLIMETER WAVE SPECTRUM. HAS

01:22:43.425 --> 01:22:46.394
EIGHT CAPABILITIES- THAT ALSO

01:22:46.461 --> 01:22:48.229
DEPEND ON HAVING A ROBUST

01:22:48.296 --> 01:22:52.767
FIBER. BACKHAUL AND TRANSPORT

01:22:52.834 --> 01:22:54.736
YEAH SEVEN NOT MATT HOW THIS

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.338
SIGNAL GETS TO YOU IT'S JUST

01:22:56.404 --> 01:22:58.773
THE LAST MILE THAT IS WIRELESS

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.442
THE MIDDLE MILE AND THE FIRST

01:23:00.508 --> 01:23:02.711
MILE IS ALL FIBER MASSIVE

01:23:02.777 --> 01:23:05.246
AMOUNTS OF FIBER SO WE USED TO

01:23:05.313 --> 01:23:07.549
DEPLOY FIBER CABLES AND A

01:23:07.615 --> 01:23:09.050
HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR CARE BUT

01:23:09.117 --> 01:23:11.853
LIKE. REALLY TINY NOW IF YOU IF

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:13.455
YOU WALK BY ANY INSTALLATION

01:23:13.521 --> 01:23:14.856
WHERE WE'RE PUTTING FIBER WE'RE

01:23:14.923 --> 01:23:17.959
PUTTING A THOUSAND HAIR FIBER.

01:23:18.026 --> 01:23:21.262
CABLE YEAH THAT'S THE LARGER

01:23:21.329 --> 01:23:22.931
THAN THE FIRST INTER

01:23:22.997 --> 01:23:24.632
CONTINENTAL C. CABLE THAT

01:23:24.699 --> 01:23:26.868
TRANSPORTED ALL THE DATA FROM

01:23:26.935 --> 01:23:29.337
NORTH AMERICA ASIA RIGHT IT'S

01:23:29.404 --> 01:23:31.706
HUGE AND REPORTING THAT AND

01:23:31.773 --> 01:23:32.540
EVERYWHERE TO BACK UP ITS

01:23:32.607 --> 01:23:35.076
NETWORK. BUT FOR FIVE G. WHAT

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:37.445
MAKES FIVE G. WIRELESS RADIO

01:23:37.512 --> 01:23:40.048
FREQUENCY SPECTRUM SO I'M

01:23:40.115 --> 01:23:42.150
BASING ARE THE EIGHT CURRENCIES

01:23:42.217 --> 01:23:43.551
WE CALL IT AND SO I'LL GO

01:23:43.618 --> 01:23:44.719
THROUGH THEM REALLY QUICKLY

01:23:44.786 --> 01:23:46.020
YOU'VE ALREADY CUT. YOU KNOW

01:23:46.087 --> 01:23:47.822
HEARD IT FROM THE PRIOR PANEL

01:23:47.889 --> 01:23:50.091
BUT- THE THROUGHPUT OR THE

01:23:50.158 --> 01:23:51.593
SPEEDS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:23:51.659 --> 01:23:54.229
WITH FIVE G. SO THINK OF THE

01:23:54.295 --> 01:23:56.498
FOUR GLT IS GIVING YOU MEGABIT

01:23:56.564 --> 01:23:57.632
LEVEL CONNECTIVITY WHICH IS

01:23:57.699 --> 01:23:58.867
PRETTY GOOD YOU COULD STREAM

01:23:58.933 --> 01:24:00.835
NETFLIX RIGHT YOU CAN. DO

01:24:00.902 --> 01:24:02.270
PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING ON YOUR

01:24:02.337 --> 01:24:04.339
MOBILE DEVICE. FIVE G. IS GOING

01:24:04.406 --> 01:24:08.009
TO GET. GIGABIT LEVEL

01:24:08.076 --> 01:24:08.843
CONNECTIVITY AND SOME OF YOU

01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:09.744
MAY SAY WELL I'M REALLY NEED TO

01:24:09.811 --> 01:24:12.580
GET TO MY PHONE. AND YEAH

01:24:12.647 --> 01:24:13.415
THAT'S THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE FOR

01:24:13.481 --> 01:24:15.617
RIGHT NOW. BUT PEOPLE NEED A

01:24:15.683 --> 01:24:18.386
GIG TO THEIR HOMES OR SMALL

01:24:18.453 --> 01:24:20.321
BUSINESSES THAT'S AGAIN THE

01:24:20.388 --> 01:24:22.190
KILLER APP FOR FIVE G. PEOPLE

01:24:22.257 --> 01:24:23.992
THINK OF FIVE G. AS MOBILE

01:24:24.058 --> 01:24:26.294
RIGHT. YES IT'S MOBILE BUT IT'S

01:24:26.361 --> 01:24:28.363
ALSO GOING TO ENABLE FIXED

01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:30.765
WIRELESS ACCESS INSTALLING A

01:24:30.832 --> 01:24:32.667
NODE MUCH MUCH SMALLER THAN A

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:34.102
SATELLITE DISH LOOKS LIKE A

01:24:34.169 --> 01:24:37.138
WIFI BOX ON YOUR ROOF. OR YOUR

01:24:37.205 --> 01:24:39.974
WINDOW AND THAT ALLOWS THE FIVE

01:24:40.041 --> 01:24:41.843
G. SIGNAL TO BE PROPAGATED ARE

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:44.512
BEAMED TO YOUR HOME OR SMALL

01:24:44.579 --> 01:24:46.648
BUSINESS. THAT'S THE LAST MILE

01:24:46.714 --> 01:24:48.450
AND TALKING ABOUT SO YOU GET

01:24:48.516 --> 01:24:50.919
GIGABIT LEVEL SPEEDS. FIVE G.

01:24:50.985 --> 01:24:53.254
HOME- OR FIVE G. SMALL

01:24:53.321 --> 01:24:56.524
BUSINESS- THE PRIOR PANEL

01:24:56.591 --> 01:24:58.293
TALKED ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL-

01:24:58.359 --> 01:25:00.595
IT- THE GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL

01:25:00.662 --> 01:25:02.464
IMPACTS SO THE SERVICE

01:25:02.530 --> 01:25:03.565
DEPLOYMENT IS THE SECOND

01:25:03.631 --> 01:25:06.234
CAPABILITY. OF FIVE G. IT'S

01:25:06.301 --> 01:25:06.835
ALSO CALLED NETWORK

01:25:06.901 --> 01:25:09.237
VIRTUALISATION. SO THINK OF IT

01:25:09.304 --> 01:25:10.805
IS INSTEAD OF IF SOMETHING

01:25:10.872 --> 01:25:13.141
HAPPENS IN THIS FAST RADIO

01:25:13.208 --> 01:25:14.542
ACCESS NETWORK THAT WE HAVE TO

01:25:14.609 --> 01:25:17.011
BUILD THE TO CONNECT EVERYBODY.

01:25:17.078 --> 01:25:18.546
SOMETHING HAPPENS WAY OUT IN

01:25:18.613 --> 01:25:20.715
THE MIDDLE OF SOMEWHERE IN

01:25:20.782 --> 01:25:23.117
CALIFORNIA. IT WOULD TAKE

01:25:23.184 --> 01:25:24.886
SOMETIMES MONTHS FOR THE

01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:27.055
ENGINEERING TEAM TO GO OUT. AND

01:25:27.121 --> 01:25:28.957
FIND A HARDWARE THAT IS CAUSING

01:25:29.023 --> 01:25:30.859
THAT PROBLEM. WITH FIVE G.

01:25:30.925 --> 01:25:32.260
SERVICE DEPLOYMENT AND NETWORK

01:25:32.327 --> 01:25:34.262
VIRTUALISATION BACK IT HAPPENED

01:25:34.329 --> 01:25:36.331
BY THE SOFTWARE CAN HAPPEN

01:25:36.397 --> 01:25:37.966
ELECTRONICALLY. SO WHAT WOULD

01:25:38.032 --> 01:25:40.368
IT TAKE MONTHS. WOULD NOW TAKE

01:25:40.435 --> 01:25:42.804
DAYS OR EVEN HOURS TO FIX THE

01:25:42.871 --> 01:25:44.005
PROBLEM IN THE NETWORK

01:25:44.072 --> 01:25:45.607
SOMEWHERE SO YOU HAVE THAT

01:25:45.673 --> 01:25:47.008
AMAZING SERVICE DEPLOYMENT

01:25:47.075 --> 01:25:49.210
CAPABILITY. THE THIRD CURRENCY

01:25:49.277 --> 01:25:52.380
IS MOBILITY RIGHT SO WE EXPECT

01:25:52.447 --> 01:25:53.414
YOU KNOW TALK ABOUT FIXED

01:25:53.481 --> 01:25:55.917
WIRELESS ACCESS FIVE G. HOME

01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:59.387
BEING THE KILLER APP- MOBILITY-

01:25:59.454 --> 01:26:01.122
IS ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT FOR

01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:03.625
OUR- SAFETY AND ACCESS TO NINE

01:26:03.691 --> 01:26:05.260
ONE ONE. WHEN YOU'RE GOING

01:26:05.326 --> 01:26:06.427
ANYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA USED TO

01:26:06.494 --> 01:26:08.596
GO TO TAHOE LIKE IT'S GOT ZERO

01:26:08.663 --> 01:26:09.864
BARS NOW WE GO TO TAHOE AND I

01:26:09.931 --> 01:26:12.166
GET FOUR BARS IF YOU'RE HIKING

01:26:12.233 --> 01:26:13.434
YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO CALL

01:26:13.501 --> 01:26:15.703
NINE ONE ONE. MOBILITY FIVE G.

01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:17.705
IS GOING TO ENHANCE THE SPEEDS

01:26:17.772 --> 01:26:19.307
THE COVERAGE IN THE CAPACITY OF

01:26:19.374 --> 01:26:21.643
THE MOBILE NETWORK. AND IT'S

01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:24.512
DESIGNED TO WORK AT FIVE

01:26:24.579 --> 01:26:25.847
HUNDRED KILLER KILOMETERS PER

01:26:25.914 --> 01:26:28.049
HOUR OR THREE HUNDRED TEN MILES

01:26:28.116 --> 01:26:30.251
PER HOUR SO THINK OF. HIGH

01:26:30.318 --> 01:26:32.620
SPEED TRAINS GOING TO BE ABLE

01:26:32.687 --> 01:26:35.056
TO ACCESS FIVE G. I VERY HIS

01:26:35.123 --> 01:26:40.728
YOURSELF. GOING AT HIGH VERY

01:26:40.795 --> 01:26:42.330
HIGH SPEEDS THIS CURRENT IS

01:26:42.397 --> 01:26:43.398
DATA BAR OR THE CUT I TALKED

01:26:43.464 --> 01:26:45.633
ABOUT THE LAW ON A RIGHT SO YOU

01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:47.335
HAVE COVERAGE DO I HAVE

01:26:47.402 --> 01:26:49.938
COVERAGE IN THIS AREA RIGHT YES

01:26:50.004 --> 01:26:51.372
I'M IN DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO

01:26:51.439 --> 01:26:53.308
RIGHT NOW YES I HAVE COVERAGE.

01:26:53.374 --> 01:26:54.909
BUT IF EVERYONE GETS ON THE

01:26:54.976 --> 01:26:56.311
NETWORK AT THE SAME TIME THAT

01:26:56.377 --> 01:26:57.045
DOES THE BECOME A COVERAGE

01:26:57.111 --> 01:26:59.180
PROBLEM APPLICANTS THE CAPACITY

01:26:59.247 --> 01:27:00.915
PROBLEM. IS BY GETTING IN AN

01:27:00.982 --> 01:27:02.483
ELEVATOR THERE'S ONLY SO MANY

01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:06.054
PEOPLE THAT CAN GET IT. SO WITH

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:08.122
WITH FIVE G. THE CAPACITY OF

01:27:08.189 --> 01:27:09.857
THE DATA VOLUME IS TEN

01:27:09.924 --> 01:27:12.794
TERABYTES PER. SECOND PER

01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:15.663
SQUARE KILOMETER THAT'S HUGE IF

01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:16.965
YOU THINK OF THE PRIOR PANEL

01:27:17.031 --> 01:27:19.233
TALKING ABOUT EVERY PAYING WITH

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:21.569
A CHIP IN IT. BEING CONNECTED

01:27:21.636 --> 01:27:23.571
TO THE INTERNET GOING FORWARD.

01:27:23.638 --> 01:27:25.673
MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF THE VOLUMES

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:27.308
BEING CONNECTED TO THE TO THE

01:27:27.375 --> 01:27:28.309
INTERNET AS WE GO FORWARD WE

01:27:28.376 --> 01:27:29.877
HAVE TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY

01:27:29.944 --> 01:27:32.146
OF THESE NETWORKS. AND THIS

01:27:32.213 --> 01:27:32.947
RESPECTABLE OUT THAT THAT

01:27:33.014 --> 01:27:35.049
HAPPENED. THE SEVENTH. AND

01:27:35.116 --> 01:27:37.085
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT CAPABILITY

01:27:37.151 --> 01:27:39.487
OUR CURRENCY OF FIVE G. IS THE

01:27:39.554 --> 01:27:42.123
ULTRA LOW LATENCY. LATENCY

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:43.491
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE A GAMER OR

01:27:43.558 --> 01:27:46.160
IF YOUR KIDS ARE GAMERS. YOU

01:27:46.227 --> 01:27:48.363
MIGHT HEAR THEM GLITCHED OUT OR

01:27:48.429 --> 01:27:49.998
THEY PUSH THE BUTTON TO FIRE

01:27:50.064 --> 01:27:51.466
AND THEN A SECOND LATER IT

01:27:51.532 --> 01:27:53.001
FIRES ARE YOU HAVE A OUR VR

01:27:53.067 --> 01:27:54.836
GOGGLES ON. IF YOU DON'T HAVE

01:27:54.902 --> 01:27:56.738
VERY VERY LOW LATENCY WHICH IS

01:27:56.804 --> 01:27:58.473
THE TIME IT TAKES FOR YOUR

01:27:58.539 --> 01:28:01.442
DEVICE TO YOU PUSH YOUR DEVICE

01:28:01.509 --> 01:28:02.810
TO DO SOMETHING AND IT DOESN'T

01:28:02.877 --> 01:28:04.679
IT NEEDS TO BE BLINK OF AN EYE

01:28:04.746 --> 01:28:06.180
OR IF YOU HAVE THAT AS A OUR VR

01:28:06.247 --> 01:28:07.415
GOGGLES ON YOU'RE GONNA GET

01:28:07.482 --> 01:28:08.316
KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE

01:28:08.383 --> 01:28:11.119
LIKE. WAY OUT OF WHACK SO THE

01:28:11.185 --> 01:28:12.954
EXTREMELY LOW BLINK OF AN EYE

01:28:13.021 --> 01:28:15.189
LATENCY IS THE CAPABILITY OF

01:28:15.256 --> 01:28:17.125
FIVE G. AND THEN OF COURSE THE

01:28:17.191 --> 01:28:18.893
EIGHT CURRENCY THAT WE HAVE. IS

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:21.429
ULTRA HIGH SERVICE RELIABILITY

01:28:21.496 --> 01:28:22.597
AND WE TALKED YOU KNOW THE

01:28:22.664 --> 01:28:23.564
PANEL TALKED ABOUT HOW IT

01:28:23.631 --> 01:28:25.233
CREDIBLY IMPORTANT. NETWORK

01:28:25.299 --> 01:28:28.369
RESILIENCY AND RELIABILITY IS

01:28:28.436 --> 01:28:30.638
AS WE DEPEND ON THESE NETWORKS

01:28:30.705 --> 01:28:32.907
FOR EVERYTHING TO LIVE TO WORK

01:28:32.974 --> 01:28:35.343
TO ACCESS PUBLIC SAFETY.

01:28:35.410 --> 01:28:36.310
TELEHEALTH AND DISTANCE

01:28:36.377 --> 01:28:38.579
LEARNING. SO I HOPE THAT

01:28:38.646 --> 01:28:39.247
PROVIDED A LITTLE BIT OF

01:28:39.313 --> 01:28:41.349
CONTEXT FOR UP TO FIVE G. THE

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:43.685
KILLER APP IS BROADBAND. AND

DOLLAR BROADBAND PACKAGE IS.

01:28:51.659 --> 01:28:53.294
GOING TO BE TRANSFORMATIONAL.

01:28:53.361 --> 01:28:55.430
IF WE CAN ALSO MAKE SURE THAT

01:28:55.496 --> 01:28:56.898
WE WORK WITH OUR CITIES AND

01:28:56.964 --> 01:28:58.533
COUNTIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:28:58.599 --> 01:29:00.301
TO GET THOSE PERMITS THROUGH.

01:29:00.368 --> 01:29:02.303
IT THE AGREEMENTS IN PLACE. WE

DON'T WANT THAT MONEY TO BE

01:29:03.638 --> 01:29:04.839
WASTED TO GET SHOVELS IN THE

01:29:04.906 --> 01:29:08.376
GROUND WE ALSO NEED LOCAL WERE

TO HEAR THAT FIVE G. COULD BE

01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:21.289
IT OR IS THE SOLUTION TO FIXING

01:29:21.355 --> 01:29:23.357
THAT PROBLEM. I WITH THAT- LET

US GO TO OUR LAST PANELIST AND-

01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:28.162
FOR THIS PANEL. DO WHICH IS UP

AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY. WITH A

01:29:33.701 --> 01:29:36.137
TNT SO MISTER BOYER. FLOORS

01:29:36.204 --> 01:29:40.908
YOURS. YES SOME OF THE NUMBER

HAVING ME HERE TODAY- I'M CHRIS

01:29:43.945 --> 01:29:46.280
WHERE WITH EIGHTEEN T. AND- MY

01:29:46.347 --> 01:29:47.615
EXPERTISE IS REALLY ON THE

01:29:47.682 --> 01:29:49.650
SECURITY SIDE OF FIVE USE

01:29:49.717 --> 01:29:50.752
SOMEONE TO TALK ABOUT THAT BUT

01:29:50.818 --> 01:29:52.587
SINCE. OUR PANEL IS ALSO

01:29:52.653 --> 01:29:53.855
FOCUSED A LITTLE BIT ON A

01:29:53.921 --> 01:29:56.324
DIFFERENT USE CASES AND- AROUND

01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.891
FIVE YEAH I THOUGHT I WOULD

01:29:56.958 --> 01:29:57.959
JUST START OUT START OFF BY

01:29:58.025 --> 01:29:59.927
TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME

01:29:59.994 --> 01:30:00.495
OF THE USE CASES WE'VE BEEN

01:30:00.561 --> 01:30:02.296
DISCUSSING. HERE IN WASHINGTON

01:30:02.363 --> 01:30:03.397
WITH VARIOUS ASPECTS F THE

01:30:03.464 --> 01:30:05.666
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO- I THINK

01:30:05.733 --> 01:30:08.636
SOME OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS-

01:30:08.703 --> 01:30:11.539
DR- NOT A COUPLE AND OTHERS-

01:30:11.606 --> 01:30:13.074
AND RUDY ALSO SPOKE ABOUT THIS

01:30:13.141 --> 01:30:14.876
ISSUE BUT THE REAL BENEFITS OF

01:30:14.942 --> 01:30:17.178
FIVE G. R. THE LOWER LATENCY

01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:18.346
THE MASSIVE CONNECTIVITY IN THE

01:30:18.412 --> 01:30:19.914
FASTER SPEEDS ALL THREE OF

01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:21.682
THOSE THINGS COMBINED. ARE WHAT

01:30:21.749 --> 01:30:23.417
REALLY MAKE UP THE USE CASES

01:30:23.484 --> 01:30:24.519
AND THE BENEFITS ARE GOING TO

01:30:24.585 --> 01:30:26.921
SEE WITH FIVE G. IT'S A DEPEND

01:30:26.988 --> 01:30:29.423
UPON- THE USE CASE DIFFERENT

01:30:29.490 --> 01:30:30.458
ASPECTS OF THAT ARE MORE

01:30:30.525 --> 01:30:32.059
IMPORTANT THAN OTHERS. BUT I

01:30:32.126 --> 01:30:33.327
THINK I THINK THE MAIN POINT

01:30:33.394 --> 01:30:34.595
HERE IS THAT FIVE G. IS REALLY

01:30:34.662 --> 01:30:37.265
NOT ABOUT- JUST A CONSUMER

01:30:37.331 --> 01:30:39.100
GETTING YOU KNOW FASTER ACCESS

01:30:39.167 --> 01:30:40.067
TO THEIR FAVORITE VIDEO

01:30:40.134 --> 01:30:41.235
STREAMING SERVICE RIGHT THERE

01:30:41.302 --> 01:30:43.070
FOUND IT'S REALLY ABOUT. A LOT

01:30:43.137 --> 01:30:44.238
OF THESE APPLICATIONS THAT CAN

01:30:44.305 --> 01:30:45.606
BE ENABLED BY THAT COMBINATION

01:30:45.673 --> 01:30:47.542
OF SPEAKING ACTIVITY AND- AND

01:30:47.608 --> 01:30:50.344
LATENCY- AND SO YOU WHEN YOU

01:30:50.411 --> 01:30:51.946
WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT FOUR G. I

01:30:52.013 --> 01:30:54.048
DON'T THINK ANYONE REALLY- A

01:30:54.115 --> 01:30:56.551
MAGIC IN THAT. THE KILLER APP

01:30:56.617 --> 01:30:57.251
FOR FOUR G. WOULD BE THINGS

01:30:57.318 --> 01:30:59.253
LIKE THE GIG ECONOMY OR UBER

01:30:59.320 --> 01:30:59.987
BUT THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF

01:31:00.054 --> 01:31:01.689
APPLICATIONS THAT WE REALLY SAW

01:31:01.756 --> 01:31:03.291
TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF THE FASTER

01:31:03.357 --> 01:31:05.226
SPEED BEFORE CHEATING AND SO

01:31:05.293 --> 01:31:06.961
WITH FIVE G. WE HAVE AN IDEA OF

01:31:07.028 --> 01:31:08.830
WHAT A LOT OF THESE-

01:31:08.896 --> 01:31:10.164
APPLICATIONS MIGHT BE

01:31:10.231 --> 01:31:11.632
ESPECIALLY IN THE ENTERPRISE

01:31:11.699 --> 01:31:13.000
SPACE BUT I THINK ON THE

01:31:13.067 --> 01:31:14.936
CONSUMER SIDE. YOU KNOW THE-

01:31:15.002 --> 01:31:15.736
FIVE G. WILL DO IS IT'LL

01:31:15.803 --> 01:31:18.139
JUMPSTART. A WAVE OF THE

01:31:18.206 --> 01:31:19.974
UNFORESEEN INNOVATION THAT IT'S

01:31:20.041 --> 01:31:20.842
REALLY HARD TO PREDICT RIGHT

01:31:20.908 --> 01:31:22.643
NOW BUT I THINK I THINK THERE

01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:23.544
ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE

01:31:23.611 --> 01:31:24.946
HAPPENING TODAY- SOME COUPLE

01:31:25.012 --> 01:31:27.081
GOOD EXAMPLES OF THIS ARE. YOU

01:31:27.148 --> 01:31:28.649
AT AND T. WE OPENED UP A FIVE

01:31:28.716 --> 01:31:31.586
G. INNOVATION STUDIO- APRIL

01:31:31.652 --> 01:31:32.887
TWENTY TWENTY ONE- BUT THAT'S

01:31:32.954 --> 01:31:34.088
REALLY INTENDED TO DO IS

01:31:34.155 --> 01:31:40.027
XCELERATED PATH. TO MARKET FOR

01:31:40.094 --> 01:31:40.595
NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS IN IN

01:31:40.661 --> 01:31:41.796
OTHER IT IS I JUST A COUPLE OF

01:31:41.863 --> 01:31:42.463
THE OF USE CASE THAT WORK

01:31:42.530 --> 01:31:44.699
LOOKING AT AND AT RIDICULOUS

01:31:44.765 --> 01:31:46.767
INTERVENTIONS ONE IS IDEA OF A

01:31:46.834 --> 01:31:48.769
DRONE CAN SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING

01:31:48.836 --> 01:31:50.538
WITH MICROSOFT AS YOUR- YOU'RE

01:31:50.605 --> 01:31:51.672
NOT FAMILIAR THAT MEASURE IT'S

01:31:51.739 --> 01:31:53.774
THE MICROSOFT CLOUD PLATFORM-

01:31:53.841 --> 01:31:56.143
IN THE DRONE COMPANY EVA- TO

01:31:56.210 --> 01:31:58.312
EVALUATE HOW OUR FIVE G.

01:31:58.379 --> 01:31:59.013
NETWORK COMBINED WITH EDGE

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:00.815
COMPUTING. CAN ALLOW FOR NEAR

01:32:00.882 --> 01:32:03.484
TIME DRONE CONTROL EVEN EVEN

01:32:03.551 --> 01:32:05.119
BEYOND VISUAL LINE OF SIGHT TO

01:32:05.186 --> 01:32:06.187
COULD YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE

01:32:06.254 --> 01:32:07.121
FIVE G. NETWORK TO CONTROL

01:32:07.188 --> 01:32:08.756
DRONES. BEYOND THE VISUAL LINE

01:32:08.823 --> 01:32:09.457
OF SIGHT IN THIS IS

01:32:09.523 --> 01:32:10.691
PARTICULARLY INTERESTING

01:32:10.758 --> 01:32:12.393
EIGHTEEN T. BECAUSE- WE HAVE A

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:13.794
LOT OF PUBLIC SAFETY CUSTOMERS

01:32:13.861 --> 01:32:16.597
WE HAVE TO USE DRONES AND- THE

01:32:16.664 --> 01:32:18.733
PAST RECOVERY SITUATIONS AND

01:32:18.799 --> 01:32:20.835
MONITORING THE NETWORK SO- I

01:32:20.902 --> 01:32:21.969
UNDERSTAND HOW IT USED THE FIVE

01:32:22.036 --> 01:32:23.404
G. NETWORK TO CONTROL DRONES IS

01:32:23.471 --> 01:32:25.273
AN ISSUE THAT- IS IT IS THE USE

01:32:25.339 --> 01:32:26.007
CASE THAT WERE PARTICULARLY

01:32:26.073 --> 01:32:29.176
INTERESTED IN- ANOTHER EXAMPLE

01:32:29.243 --> 01:32:31.045
IS HOLOGRAPHIC COMMUNICATIONS-

01:32:31.112 --> 01:32:32.079
THIS IS REALLY A CONSUMER

01:32:32.146 --> 01:32:33.614
APPLICATION BUT- YOU KNOW IN

01:32:33.681 --> 01:32:35.216
DECEMBER. EIGHTEENTH IN

01:32:35.283 --> 01:32:36.984
ERICSSON WE WORK TOGETHER ON.

01:32:37.051 --> 01:32:39.587
THE RAINY. ET HEARSE OF

01:32:39.654 --> 01:32:41.022
HOLOGRAPHIC COMMUNICATION

01:32:41.088 --> 01:32:42.456
WITHOUT THE TYPE OF HARDWARE

01:32:42.523 --> 01:32:43.324
THE TECHNOLOGY TYPICALLY

01:32:43.391 --> 01:32:45.326
REQUIRES SO WE CAN USE. THE

01:32:45.393 --> 01:32:47.628
COMBINATION OF FIVE G. A. I. IN

01:32:47.695 --> 01:32:48.930
SOME OF THE- MOBILE AND

01:32:48.996 --> 01:32:50.698
COMPUTING FUNCTIONALITY- THE

01:32:50.765 --> 01:32:52.099
DOCTOR NEED TO CALL TALK SPOKE

01:32:52.166 --> 01:32:53.467
ABOUT. YOU KNOW WITH THE-

01:32:53.534 --> 01:32:55.102
STANDARD FIVE G. SMARTPHONE TO

01:32:55.169 --> 01:32:56.771
DELIVER. YOU KNOW HOLOGRAPHIC

01:32:56.837 --> 01:32:58.306
COMMUNICATION ARE HOLOGRAPHIC

01:32:58.372 --> 01:32:59.540
IMAGES SO THAT'S- THAT'S

01:32:59.607 --> 01:33:00.074
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE JUST

01:33:00.141 --> 01:33:01.909
TESTING IS VERY MUCH IN THE-

01:33:01.976 --> 01:33:03.210
INITIAL STAGES BUT WE DO THINK

01:33:03.277 --> 01:33:04.078
THAT SOMETHING IT WILL BE

01:33:04.145 --> 01:33:06.213
POSSIBLE FOR. A MASS CONSUMER

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:07.214
ADOPTION SOMEWHERE DOWN THE

01:33:07.281 --> 01:33:09.884
ROAD- ALSO WORKING ON SMART

01:33:09.951 --> 01:33:12.353
MANUFACTURING AND SO- YOU KNOW

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:14.455
WE CAN DO THINGS- IN TERMS OF

01:33:14.522 --> 01:33:15.489
MANUFACTURING THAT REALLY

01:33:15.556 --> 01:33:17.792
TRANSFORMS THAT- YOU KNOW WE

01:33:17.858 --> 01:33:19.493
KEEP WE CAN COMBINE. YOU KNOW

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:20.594
FIVE G. WITH EDGE COMPUTING

01:33:20.661 --> 01:33:23.197
FUNCTIONALITY- TO PROVIDE SMART

01:33:23.264 --> 01:33:24.131
SAFETY DEVICES FOR

01:33:24.198 --> 01:33:25.866
MANUFACTURERS ACTUALLY. WE

01:33:25.933 --> 01:33:28.970
ACTUALLY HAVE A- A SMART FIVE

01:33:29.036 --> 01:33:30.471
G. A MANUFACTURING FACILITY

01:33:30.538 --> 01:33:31.872
THAT WE PUT TOGETHER IN AUSTIN

01:33:31.939 --> 01:33:34.508
WITH WITH- WITH SAM SONG IT'S A

01:33:34.575 --> 01:33:40.781
GREAT. DEMONSTRATION OF FIVE G.

01:33:40.848 --> 01:33:42.083
MANUFACTORY I SEEN DIED THAT

01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:43.050
ILLUSTRATE HOW CAN LIVE BECAUSE

01:33:43.117 --> 01:33:43.951
YOU COULD PUSH THE COMPUTE

01:33:44.018 --> 01:33:46.387
FUNCTION FIVE G. WITH ALL THAT

01:33:46.454 --> 01:33:47.655
YOU KNOW CLOSER TO THE YOU CAN

01:33:47.722 --> 01:33:48.789
ACTUALLY UP WITH THAT WHERE FOR

01:33:48.856 --> 01:33:50.825
EXAMPLE THE CRITICAL DATA THAT

01:33:50.891 --> 01:33:52.960
USED TO RUNA MANUFACTURING

01:33:53.027 --> 01:33:53.995
PLANT OUR MANUFACTURING

01:33:54.061 --> 01:33:56.430
FACILITY. IS SELF CONTAINED ON

01:33:56.497 --> 01:33:57.264
THE PREMISE YOU CAN PUT THE

01:33:57.331 --> 01:33:59.133
COMPUTE FUNCTIONALITY ON TREND.

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:00.134
IN THE CALL YOU KNOW IN A CALL

01:34:00.201 --> 01:34:02.236
IN A AN ON PREM SERVER CLOUD

01:34:02.303 --> 01:34:03.504
ENVIRONMENT WE AN KEEP THAT

01:34:03.571 --> 01:34:05.473
DATA. CONFINED TO THE TO THE

01:34:05.539 --> 01:34:07.408
MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND ONLY

01:34:07.475 --> 01:34:08.442
ALLOW YOU KNOW THE

01:34:08.509 --> 01:34:09.110
COMMUNICATIONS THAT ARE

01:34:09.176 --> 01:34:10.177
NECESSARY LIKE LET'S SAY AN

01:34:10.244 --> 01:34:11.145
EMPLOYEE WANTS TO GO CHECK

01:34:11.212 --> 01:34:12.246
THEIR EMAIL OR SOMETHING. AND

01:34:12.313 --> 01:34:13.147
THEY HAVE TO GO ON THE PUBLIC

01:34:13.214 --> 01:34:14.715
INTERNET THAT YOU CAN REALLY

01:34:14.782 --> 01:34:16.684
START TO. DO THINGS TOO- DIVIDE

01:34:16.751 --> 01:34:18.419
UP TRAFFIC AND ENSURE THAT

01:34:18.486 --> 01:34:20.488
SEEKS THAT REALLY- IMPORTANT

01:34:20.554 --> 01:34:22.056
TRAFFIC NEVER LEAVES THE-

01:34:22.123 --> 01:34:23.357
MANUFACTURING LOCATION BY

01:34:23.424 --> 01:34:24.725
LEVERAGING A COMBINATION OF

01:34:24.792 --> 01:34:26.427
FIVE G. AND OTHER. TECHNOLOGIES

01:34:26.494 --> 01:34:27.361
SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS

01:34:27.428 --> 01:34:28.963
HAPPENING HERE- THAT WE THINK

01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:31.265
WILL BE- YOU KNOW REALLY CHANGE

01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:33.768
HOW MANUFACTURING WORKS- IS

01:34:33.834 --> 01:34:35.102
IMMENSE AND SOME OF THE OTHER

01:34:35.169 --> 01:34:35.803
BENEFITS THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY

01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:37.371
WORKING ON. IN ON THE CONSUMER

01:34:37.438 --> 01:34:38.672
SIDE YOU KNOW I MENTIONED HOW

01:34:38.739 --> 01:34:39.573
THE GRAPHICS BUT THERE'S ALSO

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:41.242
OTHER APPLICATIONS. YOU KNOW

01:34:41.308 --> 01:34:43.411
GAMINI E. SPORTS TRAVEL

01:34:43.477 --> 01:34:44.745
APPLICATIONS ALL SORTS OF

01:34:44.812 --> 01:34:46.013
THINGS THAT ARE OUT THERE I

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:47.448
THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT

01:34:47.515 --> 01:34:48.749
YOU WILL KNOW WHEN WE SEE IT

01:34:48.816 --> 01:34:49.917
RIGHT A LOT OF THIS IS GONNA

01:34:49.984 --> 01:34:52.353
HAPPEN. OVER TIME- NETWORKS

01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:53.988
GOING TO BE BUILT OUT AND I

01:34:54.055 --> 01:34:55.022
THINK WHAT WE'LL SEE IS A LOT

01:34:55.089 --> 01:34:56.824
OF THE INNOVATORS FRANKLY- YOU

01:34:56.891 --> 01:34:58.325
KNOW I SPENT THREE YEARS IN.

01:34:58.392 --> 01:34:59.760
SILICON VALLEY WORKING FOR

01:34:59.827 --> 01:35:00.728
EIGHTEEN T. AND- YOU KNOW I

01:35:00.795 --> 01:35:01.529
THINK A LOT OF THE INNOVATORS

01:35:01.595 --> 01:35:02.096
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO WILL

01:35:02.163 --> 01:35:04.065
ULTIMATELY. BE WORKING ON

01:35:04.131 --> 01:35:05.099
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY

01:35:05.166 --> 01:35:07.334
CAN DO ON TOP OF. THE BENEFITS

01:35:07.401 --> 01:35:08.903
THAT RECEIVE A FIVE G. TERMS OF

01:35:08.969 --> 01:35:14.742
BROADBAND. AND LATENCY- THAT'S

01:35:14.809 --> 01:35:15.342
KIND OF JUST WILL RESPECT ON

01:35:15.409 --> 01:35:18.646
YOU TO BE OUR YES HERE TO SEE

01:35:18.712 --> 01:35:19.647
SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S

01:35:19.713 --> 01:35:20.581
BEEN ENTIRE LIFE BASED WORKING

01:35:20.648 --> 01:35:23.250
ON SECURING ISSUES FIVE G.

01:35:23.317 --> 01:35:24.585
NETWORKS- YOU KNOW SOMEONE

01:35:24.652 --> 01:35:25.386
WHO'S BEEN A LOT OF QUESTIONS

01:35:25.453 --> 01:35:27.221
ABOUT FIVE G. SECURITY. YEAH

01:35:27.288 --> 01:35:28.622
WHEN I THINK ABOUT SECURITY IS

01:35:28.689 --> 01:35:29.990
NOT JUST THE NETWORK RIGHT NOW

01:35:30.057 --> 01:35:31.425
I THINK- SOME OF THE PREVIOUS

01:35:31.492 --> 01:35:32.393
SPEAKERS TOUCHED ON THIS.

01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:33.928
SECURITY IS REALLY ABOUT EACH

01:35:33.994 --> 01:35:34.528
ONE OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE

01:35:34.595 --> 01:35:36.030
NETWORK RIGHTS SO. THE NETWORK

01:35:36.097 --> 01:35:37.531
IS NOT JUST LIKE THE PART THAT

01:35:37.598 --> 01:35:38.866
WE MADE CHANGES EIGHTEEN T. BUT

01:35:38.933 --> 01:35:40.334
IT INCLUDES THE DEVICES. IT

01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:41.769
INCLUDES THE APPLICATION LAYER

01:35:41.836 --> 01:35:43.070
THAT'S IN THE CLOUD. SO YOU

01:35:43.137 --> 01:35:44.538
REALLY HAVE TO SECURE ALL OF

01:35:44.605 --> 01:35:47.308
THAT- BUT AT. THE BOTTOM LINE

01:35:47.374 --> 01:35:48.776
FOR FIVE G. IS THAT IT WILL BE.

01:35:48.843 --> 01:35:50.344
THE MOST ADVANCED OUR MOST

01:35:50.411 --> 01:35:52.246
SECURE NETWORK. OUR GENERATION

01:35:52.313 --> 01:35:53.380
OF WIRELESS THAT WE'VE DEPLOYED

01:35:53.447 --> 01:35:55.449
TODAY- AND THAT'S PREDOMINANTLY

01:35:55.516 --> 01:35:56.684
BECAUSE FIVE G. IS BEING

01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:58.285
DESIGNED WITH SECURITY IN MIND.

01:35:58.352 --> 01:35:59.920
YOU KNOW WHAT WE DID A LOT OF

01:35:59.987 --> 01:36:01.422
THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN THE PAST

01:36:01.489 --> 01:36:02.389
INSECURITIES BEEN WORKABLE

01:36:02.456 --> 01:36:04.625
TIME- BUT I THINK STARTING WITH

01:36:04.692 --> 01:36:05.726
WITH FOUR G. LTE NOW

01:36:05.793 --> 01:36:07.261
SPECIFICALLY WITH FIVE G.

01:36:07.328 --> 01:36:08.863
THERE'S A LOT OF FOCUS ON FIRE

01:36:08.929 --> 01:36:11.132
ON SECURITY- YOU KNOW. IN THE

01:36:11.198 --> 01:36:12.333
ECOSYSTEM IN THE STANDARDS

01:36:12.399 --> 01:36:14.068
BODIES THEMSELVES SO. A GOOD

01:36:14.135 --> 01:36:15.803
EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THAT. FIVE

01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:17.571
G. SECURITY IS BEING ADDRESSED

01:36:17.638 --> 01:36:19.773
AT THREE GP THREE GPP IS THE-

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:21.142
IS THE STANDARDS BODY THAT'S

01:36:21.208 --> 01:36:22.676
OFFICIALLY DEVELOPING THE

01:36:22.743 --> 01:36:24.445
STANDARDS FOR FIVE G. THEY HAVE

01:36:24.512 --> 01:36:25.913
A DEDICATED WORKING GROUP FOR

01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:30.951
FIVE G. SECURITY. CALLED THREE

01:36:31.018 --> 01:36:31.785
GPP AS A THREE. SB WHAT IT'S

01:36:31.852 --> 01:36:33.587
DOING ITS TACKLE YOU KNOW

01:36:33.654 --> 01:36:34.755
KI&lt;c.cyan&gt; FOR. IN THE STANDARD AND&lt;/c&gt;

01:36:34.822 --> 01:36:36.490
LESSONS FROM SO THE BEST THING

01:36:36.557 --> 01:36:37.791
ABOUT THIS PROCESS IS VERY.

01:36:37.858 --> 01:36:39.460
URGENT SO WHEN SECURITY ISSUES

01:36:39.527 --> 01:36:40.861
ARE IDENTIFIED YOU CAN TAKE IN

01:36:40.928 --> 01:36:42.796
THREE GPP. STANDARDS BODY WILL

01:36:42.863 --> 01:36:44.932
WORK ON. A NEW STANDARDS IN

01:36:44.999 --> 01:36:46.901
DIFFERENT- SOLUTIONS THAT CAN

01:36:46.967 --> 01:36:49.803
BE PUT IN PLACE TO- TO IMPROVE

01:36:49.870 --> 01:36:51.205
FIVE G. SECURITY. AND THEN THEY

01:36:51.272 --> 01:36:52.439
CAN UPDATE THE STANDARD SO

01:36:52.506 --> 01:36:54.675
EFFECTIVELY. YOU HAVE YOU KNOW

01:36:54.742 --> 01:36:56.510
FIVE G. SECURITY. BUILT INTO

01:36:56.577 --> 01:36:57.945
THIS INTO THE FIVE G. WIRELESS

01:36:58.012 --> 01:37:00.147
STANDARDS THEMSELVES- SO THAT'S

01:37:00.214 --> 01:37:02.082
THAT'S A GREAT STEP FORWARD FOR

01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.716
THE INDUSTRY AND WE THINK THAT

01:37:02.783 --> 01:37:04.718
THAT LEADS TO. A SUBSTANTIAL

01:37:04.785 --> 01:37:06.587
SECURITY BENEFITS OVER TIME.

01:37:06.654 --> 01:37:08.422
THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF-

01:37:08.489 --> 01:37:09.990
ARCHITECTURAL DIFFERENCES

01:37:10.057 --> 01:37:12.426
BETWEEN FIVE G. AND FOUR G.

01:37:12.493 --> 01:37:14.662
THAT IMPACT THE NETWORK IT WILL

01:37:14.728 --> 01:37:15.262
GIVE US NEW SECURITY

01:37:15.329 --> 01:37:17.898
CAPABILITIES- SO I THINK- I

01:37:17.965 --> 01:37:19.066
THINK ON SOME OF THE PREVIOUS

01:37:19.133 --> 01:37:20.668
SPEAKERS TOUCHED ON THIS BUT-

01:37:20.734 --> 01:37:21.702
YOU KNOW FIVE G. REALLY

01:37:21.769 --> 01:37:22.970
INTRODUCES THE NEW NETWORK

01:37:23.037 --> 01:37:25.005
SEGMENT THE MOBILE ADS. THAT

01:37:25.072 --> 01:37:26.974
WILL ENABLE YOU NEXT GENERATION

01:37:27.041 --> 01:37:28.442
I MISS IS ALSO LEASING HAVING

01:37:28.509 --> 01:37:30.211
WITH APPLICATIONS BUT- THE

01:37:30.277 --> 01:37:31.845
NETWORK GETS REALLY INCLUDES

01:37:31.912 --> 01:37:32.446
SOME OF THE COMPUTE

01:37:32.513 --> 01:37:34.114
FUNCTIONALITY. THAT WAS

01:37:34.181 --> 01:37:35.015
TRADITIONALLY PART OF THE CORE

01:37:35.082 --> 01:37:36.383
PARTS OF THE NETWORK YOU CAN

01:37:36.450 --> 01:37:37.184
THINK OF A TRADITIONAL WIRELESS

01:37:37.251 --> 01:37:39.086
NETWORK YOU HAD. YOU HAVE THE

01:37:39.153 --> 01:37:39.987
DEVICE THAT CONNECTS TO A CELL

01:37:40.054 --> 01:37:41.922
TOWER. TO CELL TOWER HAS FIBER

01:37:41.989 --> 01:37:43.857
BACKHAUL THAT GOES TO- YOU KNOW

01:37:43.924 --> 01:37:45.125
A CENTRALIZED LOCATION WHERE

01:37:45.192 --> 01:37:46.660
THE CORE NETWORK RESIDES. NOT

01:37:46.727 --> 01:37:47.828
IN THAT COURT NUMBER CONNECTS

01:37:47.895 --> 01:37:48.996
TO THE INTERNET. YOU KNOW IN

01:37:49.063 --> 01:37:50.364
THE IN THE PAST A LOT OF THE

01:37:50.431 --> 01:37:51.832
APPLICATIONS THAT WERE. THAT

01:37:51.899 --> 01:37:52.499
WERE RIGHT ON YOUR MOBILE

01:37:52.566 --> 01:37:54.602
DEVICE. WE'RE ALL COMING OFF

01:37:54.668 --> 01:37:55.436
THE INTERNET YOU CONNECTED TO

01:37:55.502 --> 01:37:57.037
THE CORE. IT'S SO THE COMPUTE

01:37:57.104 --> 01:37:58.906
FUNCTIONALITY ALL RESIDED IN

01:37:58.973 --> 01:37:59.974
THE CORE OR EVEN ON THE

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:01.075
INTERNET ITSELF ON THE PUBLIC

01:38:01.141 --> 01:38:01.809
INTERNET SO YOU HAVE TO GO

01:38:01.875 --> 01:38:03.410
THROUGH THE ENTIRE NETWORK. YOU

01:38:03.477 --> 01:38:04.211
KNOW BEFORE YOU COULD ACTUALLY

01:38:04.278 --> 01:38:06.413
GET TO. WHERE THE APPLICATION

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:11.619
IS BEING RUN- YOU KNOW WITH

01:38:11.685 --> 01:38:12.820
MOBILE EDGE COMPUTING YOU NOW

01:38:12.886 --> 01:38:13.887
ARE RUNNING THOSE APPLICATIONS

01:38:13.954 --> 01:38:15.723
CLOSER CLOSER TO THE EDGE. SO

01:38:15.789 --> 01:38:17.157
BY SHORTEN THAT DISTANCE THE

01:38:17.224 --> 01:38:19.727
AMOUNT OF. THE AMOUNT OF- THERE

01:38:19.793 --> 01:38:21.629
THE DISTANCE THAT THE- DEVICE

01:38:21.695 --> 01:38:22.863
HAS TO TRAVEL TO GET TO THE

01:38:22.930 --> 01:38:24.265
COMPUTER. KNOWLEDGE THAT'S

01:38:24.331 --> 01:38:25.266
WHAT'S GOOD THAT'S WHAT GIVES

01:38:25.332 --> 01:38:32.106
YOU. THE LOWER LATENCY BENEFITS.

01:38:32.172 --> 01:38:32.706
THAT YOU SEE WITH FIVE G. BUT

01:38:32.773 --> 01:38:33.340
THERE'S OTHER BENEFITS THAT IS

01:38:33.407 --> 01:38:34.875
WHY AS THE BEST NAKED FUNCTION

01:38:34.942 --> 01:38:36.043
CLOSER THE EDGE WE CAN NOW DO

01:38:36.110 --> 01:38:36.677
YOU THAT WE SHOULD BE DID IN

01:38:36.744 --> 01:38:37.978
THE OF THE NET FIRST WE CAN NO

01:38:38.045 --> 01:38:41.248
THOSE FUNCTION HAS SOFTWARE IN

01:38:41.315 --> 01:38:43.150
THE EDGE OF THE NETWORK SO. FOR

01:38:43.217 --> 01:38:45.219
EXAMPLE WE DO A LOT OF-

01:38:45.286 --> 01:38:46.820
DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE

01:38:46.887 --> 01:38:49.290
ATTACK DETECTION- WE CAN LOOK

01:38:49.356 --> 01:38:50.658
FOR THINGS LIKE EXFILTRATION

01:38:50.724 --> 01:38:52.793
EVENTS OF DATA- THOSE ARE THE

01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:54.028
TYPES OF THINGS THAT WE MONITOR

01:38:54.094 --> 01:38:55.362
THE NETWORK FOR. JUDICIAL

01:38:55.429 --> 01:38:56.497
RECORD THE NETWORKS OF MORE

01:38:56.563 --> 01:38:58.032
FURTHER BACK IN THE NETWORK NOW

01:38:58.098 --> 01:38:58.999
WE CAN SHIFT A LOT OF THAT

01:38:59.066 --> 01:39:00.868
CAPABILITY. CLOSER TO THE EDGE.

01:39:00.934 --> 01:39:02.202
WORKS WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE SOME

01:39:02.269 --> 01:39:03.671
OF THE ATTACKS HAPPENING. YOU

01:39:03.737 --> 01:39:05.572
KNOW CLOSER TO THE USER WHICH

01:39:05.639 --> 01:39:08.042
ALLOWS US TO- YOU KNOW PINPOINT

01:39:08.108 --> 01:39:08.942
EARN ARE NARROWED DOWN THE

01:39:09.009 --> 01:39:10.277
SCOPE OF THESE ATTACKS. AND

01:39:10.344 --> 01:39:11.278
REALLY TRY TO ADDRESS THEM

01:39:11.345 --> 01:39:12.780
CLOSER TO THOSE USERS BEFORE

01:39:12.846 --> 01:39:13.647
THEY GET BACK INTO THE BROADER

01:39:13.714 --> 01:39:15.316
PARTS OF THE NETWORK. OR WE CAN

01:39:15.382 --> 01:39:16.850
MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF DATA.

01:39:16.917 --> 01:39:18.052
THAT'S BEING DISRUPTED THERE

01:39:18.118 --> 01:39:19.019
BECAUSE IT'S ONLY AFFECTING A

01:39:19.086 --> 01:39:20.354
SMALL SET OF USERS RECEIVE

01:39:20.421 --> 01:39:21.388
GETTING BACK INTO THE CORE PART

01:39:21.455 --> 01:39:22.723
OF THE NETWORK. WHERE IT REALLY

01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:24.625
AFFECTS OF A MUCH BROADER BASE

01:39:24.692 --> 01:39:26.927
OF THE TRAFFIC- SO THAT SO I

01:39:26.994 --> 01:39:28.028
THINK THAT FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE

01:39:28.095 --> 01:39:29.630
IN ARCHITECTURE BY MOVING THAT.

01:39:29.697 --> 01:39:30.931
THAT FUNCTIONALITY CLOSER TO

01:39:30.998 --> 01:39:32.566
THE USER TO THE ADS. ACTUALLY

01:39:32.633 --> 01:39:35.035
GIVES US- QUITE A BIT MORE

01:39:35.102 --> 01:39:36.470
FLEXIBILITY TO BUILDING

01:39:36.537 --> 01:39:38.205
SECURITY. INTO THE NETWORK

01:39:38.272 --> 01:39:40.741
ITSELF- THERE'S ALSO SOME

01:39:40.808 --> 01:39:42.109
ENHANCEMENTS TO SECURITY AND

01:39:42.176 --> 01:39:43.577
FIVE G. I CAN IMAGINE A LOT OF

01:39:43.644 --> 01:39:44.511
THIS IS COMING THROUGH THE

01:39:44.578 --> 01:39:46.980
STANDARDS. SO ONE OF THEM IS.

01:39:47.047 --> 01:39:48.182
IT IS ARE ALL NETWORK IF YOU

01:39:48.248 --> 01:39:49.717
CAN STOP JUST TO BE CLEAR

01:39:49.783 --> 01:39:51.051
THERE'S OTHER THINGS GOING ON

01:39:51.118 --> 01:39:52.453
WITH DEVICES. AND APPLICATIONS

01:39:52.519 --> 01:39:54.655
BUT NOT REPEAT ITSELF LIKE

01:39:54.722 --> 01:39:55.155
EIGHTEEN TO HEAR OTHERS

01:39:55.222 --> 01:39:56.256
MANAGED. OTHER SOME VERY

01:39:56.323 --> 01:39:57.124
SPECIFIC THINGS ARE HAPPENING

01:39:57.191 --> 01:40:02.196
SO- THE THREE GPP. STANDARDS

01:40:02.262 --> 01:40:04.665
CALL FOR- STRONGER ENCRYPTION

01:40:04.732 --> 01:40:06.734
OF THE OVER THE AIR INTERFACE-

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:07.401
THAT WILL ENHANCE SECURITY

01:40:07.468 --> 01:40:09.136
BETWEEN. THE FIVE MOBILE DEVICE

01:40:09.203 --> 01:40:11.004
TO THE NETWORK SO IN THE PAST-

01:40:11.071 --> 01:40:12.239
A LOT OF THE DATA SENT BETWEEN

01:40:12.306 --> 01:40:13.006
THE MOBILE DEVICE IN THE

01:40:13.073 --> 01:40:13.941
NETWORK LIKE WHEN YOUR DEVICE

01:40:14.007 --> 01:40:15.576
IS AUTHENTICATING. ON THE

01:40:15.642 --> 01:40:16.677
NETWORK AND TRANSMITTING DATA

01:40:16.744 --> 01:40:18.412
BETWEEN YOUR PHONE. AND THE

01:40:18.479 --> 01:40:20.280
TOWER- YOU KNOW A LOT OF THAT

01:40:20.347 --> 01:40:22.349
DATA WAS SENT IN THE CLEAR-

01:40:22.416 --> 01:40:23.951
THIS WILL NOT BE ENCRYPTED- SO

01:40:24.017 --> 01:40:25.052
WHAT'S CALLED THE IN THE-

01:40:25.119 --> 01:40:26.320
INFORMATION ON THE WIRELESS

01:40:26.387 --> 01:40:33.394
NETWORK WITHOUT. BEING

01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:33.961
CORRECTED SO. THAT OVER THE

01:40:34.027 --> 01:40:34.561
INTERFACING WITH THE FIVE G.

01:40:34.628 --> 01:40:36.130
STANDARD THAT FIVE G.

01:40:36.196 --> 01:40:37.331
INTRODUCES THE NEWS ADDS ARE

01:40:37.398 --> 01:40:38.932
PROTECTION CALLED AS PPO

01:40:38.999 --> 01:40:41.969
SEVERAL THAT PROTECTS ROLE MEAN

01:40:42.035 --> 01:40:44.571
FOR. SO THAT THAT RELIEF THE

01:40:44.638 --> 01:40:45.406
ACTUALLY BETWEEN THE BY WHEN

01:40:45.472 --> 01:40:47.107
THEY WERE ACROSS AND THAT WILL

01:40:47.174 --> 01:40:48.242
ALLOW US TO IN THIS NEW

01:40:48.308 --> 01:40:49.810
PROTECTION PROXY WILL ALLOW US

01:40:49.877 --> 01:40:52.346
TO INTRODUCE- NEW BETTER

01:40:52.413 --> 01:40:53.847
MITIGATIONS AGAINST WHAT ARE

01:40:53.914 --> 01:40:55.549
CALLED SIGNALLY ATTACKS OF

01:40:55.616 --> 01:40:56.216
THINGS LIKE SS SEVEN AND

01:40:56.283 --> 01:40:58.185
DIAMETER TAX. SO IS HIS WHERE

01:40:58.252 --> 01:40:59.286
IS A ROAMING BETWEEN CARRIERS

01:40:59.353 --> 01:41:01.822
NETWORKS- FIVE G. ALSO

01:41:01.889 --> 01:41:02.890
INTRODUCES A SUBSCRIBER

01:41:02.956 --> 01:41:05.192
IDENTITY PRIVACY- YOU SEE THE

01:41:05.259 --> 01:41:07.194
SUBSCRIPTION- CONCEALED

01:41:07.261 --> 01:41:08.262
IDENTIFIER WHICH REALLY

01:41:08.328 --> 01:41:09.863
DESIGNED- TO CONCEAL AND

01:41:09.930 --> 01:41:10.864
PROTECT A FIVE YEAR

01:41:10.931 --> 01:41:12.332
SUBSCRIPTION AND IN A FIRE

01:41:12.399 --> 01:41:13.901
WHICH COULD HELP MITIGATE THE

01:41:13.967 --> 01:41:15.202
VULNERABILITY IN THE CATCHER SO

01:41:15.269 --> 01:41:16.570
I DON'T A LOT OF TECHNICAL.

01:41:16.637 --> 01:41:17.538
PROBABLY GET BUT IF YOU THINK

01:41:17.604 --> 01:41:18.705
BUT WE DIDN'T THE CATCHER IS

01:41:18.772 --> 01:41:21.508
BASICALLY A SCENARIO WHERE- YOU

01:41:21.575 --> 01:41:22.209
THINK OF LIKE I'VE EVER HEARD

01:41:22.276 --> 01:41:23.143
OF A BICYCLE THE STING RAY

01:41:23.210 --> 01:41:24.711
WHERE SOMEONE CAN COME IN AND

01:41:24.778 --> 01:41:26.814
KIND OF- SPOOF THE NETWORK AND

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:27.915
TRY TO GET YOU TO CONNECT TO

01:41:27.981 --> 01:41:29.149
THE STINGRAY DEVICE SO THEY CAN

01:41:29.216 --> 01:41:31.018
ACTUALLY SEE YOUR DATA- BY BY

01:41:31.084 --> 01:41:32.653
CONCEALING THOSE IDENTIFIERS IN

01:41:32.719 --> 01:41:34.455
THE COMBINATION OF SOME OF THE-

01:41:34.521 --> 01:41:35.556
OVER THEIR INTERFACE YOU COULD

01:41:35.622 --> 01:41:37.357
IMAGINE. PREVIOUSLY WE CAN

01:41:37.424 --> 01:41:39.626
EFFECTIVELY FOR WORKS- THE USES

01:41:39.693 --> 01:41:40.427
OF SOME OF THOSE TYPES OF

01:41:40.494 --> 01:41:42.596
DEVICES. IN THE COUNTRY'S GOING

01:41:42.663 --> 01:41:44.097
FORWARD WHICH IS A BIG ISSUE WE

01:41:44.164 --> 01:41:46.366
FOLLOW- MOBILE SECURITY-

01:41:46.433 --> 01:41:49.269
WITHOUT ABILITY- THERE'S ALSO

01:41:49.336 --> 01:41:51.605
INCREASED HOME NETWORK CONTROL-

01:41:51.672 --> 01:41:52.773
FOR AUTHENTICATION ON THE FIVE

01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:53.974
G. NETWORKS AND VERIFYING THAT

01:41:54.041 --> 01:41:55.776
DEVICE IS PRESENT THE REQUESTED

01:41:55.843 --> 01:41:57.945
SERVICE FROM THE NETWORK- AND

01:41:58.011 --> 01:41:58.946
THEN THERE'S A ADDITIONAL

01:41:59.012 --> 01:42:00.147
FRAMEWORK IS BEING PUT IN PLACE

01:42:00.214 --> 01:42:01.715
TO FACILITATE THE USE OF.

01:42:01.782 --> 01:42:03.917
SIMILAR AUTHENTICATION METHODS

01:42:03.984 --> 01:42:05.385
FOR THREE D. P. P. AND NON

01:42:05.452 --> 01:42:06.987
THREE GPP THAT WORKS SO LIKE

01:42:07.054 --> 01:42:07.921
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CELLULAR

01:42:07.988 --> 01:42:09.289
AND WIFI AS THE DEVICE JUST

01:42:09.356 --> 01:42:10.824
ACROSS DIFFERENT A DIFFERENT

01:42:10.891 --> 01:42:12.960
TYPES O WIRELESS NETWORKS SO

01:42:13.026 --> 01:42:13.861
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:42:13.927 --> 01:42:15.829
THINGS WAS GOING ON IN FIVE D.

01:42:15.896 --> 01:42:17.431
REALLY AROUND AUTHENTICATION

01:42:17.498 --> 01:42:20.501
ENCRYPTION- AND- AND HOW THE

01:42:20.567 --> 01:42:21.835
DEVICE CONNECTS TO THE NETWORK

01:42:21.902 --> 01:42:23.570
AND TRANSMITS DATA. ALL OF

01:42:23.637 --> 01:42:25.772
THESE THINGS SHOULD BE- SHOULD

01:42:25.839 --> 01:42:27.407
REALLY HELP MANAGE THE SECURITY

01:42:27.474 --> 01:42:29.376
ISSUES AROUND FIVE G. AND THEN

01:42:29.443 --> 01:42:30.377
WHEN YOU COMBINE THOSE

01:42:30.444 --> 01:42:31.945
ENHANCEMENTS WITH THE MENTIONED

01:42:32.012 --> 01:42:33.814
EARLIER WHICH THE IN THE A LOT

01:42:33.881 --> 01:42:34.648
OF IT A LOT OF THE CORE

01:42:34.715 --> 01:42:36.517
FUNCTIONALITY CLOSER TO THE

01:42:36.583 --> 01:42:38.852
EDGE. AND THEN YOU LAYER ON TOP

01:42:38.919 --> 01:42:40.153
OF THAT SOME OTHER TECHNOLOGIES

01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:48.862
THAT WE THAT WE'RE NOW SEEING.

01:42:48.929 --> 01:42:49.396
YOU KNOW REALLY FAST LIKE

01:42:49.463 --> 01:42:50.564
MACHINE OUR AND ARTIFICIAL

01:42:50.631 --> 01:42:51.732
INTELLIGENCE ANDCLOSELY BOTTOM

01:42:51.798 --> 01:42:53.300
THOSE ALL COMBINE ONE ANOTHER

01:42:53.367 --> 01:42:55.536
WILL CREATING SECURE AND IT

01:42:55.602 --> 01:42:56.436
WILL BE SEATED IN NETWORK I'M

01:42:56.503 --> 01:42:57.104
NOT GONNA SAY THAT'S A IS GONNA

01:42:57.170 --> 01:42:58.639
BE PERFECT AND WE ALL KNOW IT'S

01:42:58.705 --> 01:43:01.408
A INTEREST WERE COST MAKING TO

01:43:01.475 --> 01:43:03.544
IMPROVE SECURITY- BUT WOULD YOU

01:43:03.610 --> 01:43:04.945
THINK THAT THE FIVE G. NETWORK

01:43:05.012 --> 01:43:05.913
ARCHITECTURE CHANGES THAT ARE

01:43:05.979 --> 01:43:06.980
HAPPENING COMBINED WITH THESE

01:43:07.047 --> 01:43:08.715
OTHER TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES. WILL

01:43:08.782 --> 01:43:10.050
ULTIMATELY GIVE US GREATER

01:43:10.117 --> 01:43:11.718
FLEXIBILITY AND BETTER

01:43:11.785 --> 01:43:13.887
CAPABILITY. ULTIMATELY DEAL

01:43:13.954 --> 01:43:15.222
WITH SECURITY THREATS AS WE SEE

01:43:15.289 --> 01:43:16.957
THEM NO AS WE GO TO FIVE YOU

01:43:17.024 --> 01:43:20.394
CAN BE ALL. SO THAT HAPPENED TO

01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:21.595
QUESTIONS I YOU VERY MUCH FOR

01:43:21.662 --> 01:43:22.963
YOUR PRESENTATION I DO HAVE A

01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:24.831
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS TO FOLLOW

01:43:24.898 --> 01:43:26.500
UP. WITH THE PANELISTS THE

01:43:26.567 --> 01:43:28.602
FIRST QUESTION. ARE MOST

01:43:28.669 --> 01:43:30.203
INDUSTRIES AT A PLACE WHERE

01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:31.939
THEY FULLY UNDERSTAND THE

01:43:32.005 --> 01:43:33.607
EXTENT TO WHICH A FIVE G.

01:43:33.674 --> 01:43:35.475
NETWORKS CHANGES THEIR-

01:43:35.542 --> 01:43:38.745
RESPECTIVE INDUSTRIES. OR IS

01:43:38.812 --> 01:43:39.313
THERE STILL A GREAT DEAL OF

01:43:39.379 --> 01:43:42.449
UNKNOWNS ANY ANY PALACE SO WE

01:43:42.516 --> 01:43:51.558
FEEL LIKE THE CHINA. I CAN TELL

01:43:51.625 --> 01:43:52.626
YOU A LITTLE BIT OF THE

01:43:52.693 --> 01:43:54.695
PERSPECTIVE OF MANY. SMALL

01:43:54.761 --> 01:43:56.863
BUSINESSES THAT BE TALKED TO-

01:43:56.930 --> 01:43:59.099
AND I THINK OF ME AS A LARGE

01:43:59.166 --> 01:43:59.967
COMPANIES TO UNDERSTAND THE

01:44:00.033 --> 01:44:02.469
POTENTIAL OF FIVE G. MANY SMALL

01:44:02.536 --> 01:44:04.271
COMPANIES ARE AT SIXTY EIGHT

01:44:04.338 --> 01:44:06.306
AND HOLDING BACK ON I THINK

01:44:06.373 --> 01:44:08.875
THEY ARE EAGER TO REALIZE THE

01:44:08.942 --> 01:44:10.844
BENEFITSTHAT THEY HAD A LOT.

01:44:10.911 --> 01:44:12.613
OF ARE THERE ARE CERTAIN THE

01:44:12.679 --> 01:44:14.681
ALBERTA CRIMELINE THEN THEY

01:44:14.748 --> 01:44:15.816
HAVE TO ENGAGE IN AND THEY HAVE

01:44:15.882 --> 01:44:17.351
TO AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THEM

01:44:17.417 --> 01:44:19.419
INCOME STUFF- UTILIZING THOSE

01:44:19.486 --> 01:44:21.321
FEATURES. ASSISTANCE ON THIS

01:44:21.388 --> 01:44:22.789
BECAUSE OUR ORIGINAL CREATING

01:44:22.856 --> 01:44:24.891
THE OPTION OR CUSTOMIZED REYES

01:44:24.958 --> 01:44:26.126
SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT NOT

01:44:26.193 --> 01:44:26.994
EVEN FAMILY AGENCIES FOR

01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:28.895
EXAMPLE A STRUGGLING THE GUY

01:44:28.962 --> 01:44:30.564
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THEN TO

01:44:30.631 --> 01:44:32.032
ACTUALLY TAP INTO THOSE OPTIONS

01:44:32.099 --> 01:44:33.834
SO I'LL I'LL DEFER TO MY

01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:39.573
PARENTS. WHO COULD NOT BE MORE

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:41.608
THAN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I

01:44:41.675 --> 01:44:44.077
ANSWER I SAW LIKE A AVERAGE FOR

01:44:44.144 --> 01:44:46.446
AND WAS BUT FOR IN HIS HEART

01:44:46.513 --> 01:44:47.914
WITH THE AND WEB SERVICE TO DO

01:44:47.981 --> 01:44:49.082
SOMETHING CALLED MOBILE EDGE

01:44:49.149 --> 01:44:51.852
COMPUTE AND MOBILE EDGE COMPUTE

01:44:51.918 --> 01:44:54.354
COMBINED WITH FIVE G. AND THE

01:44:54.421 --> 01:44:57.057
MASSIVE FIBER- BACKHAUL AND

01:44:57.124 --> 01:44:59.092
TRANSPORT IT IS NECESSARY. IT

01:44:59.159 --> 01:45:01.061
THINK OF IT AS BUILDING MANY

01:45:01.128 --> 01:45:03.897
CLOUDS CLOSE TO THE EDGE OF THE

01:45:03.964 --> 01:45:07.467
NETWORK SO- AMAZON HAS ALREADY.

01:45:07.534 --> 01:45:10.771
TRANSFORMED OUR LIVESBY

01:45:10.837 --> 01:45:11.905
BUILDING THE CARPET YOU KNOW

01:45:11.972 --> 01:45:13.440
HELPING BUILD A CLOUD ONE OF

01:45:13.507 --> 01:45:15.075
THE CLOUD PROVIDERS. WHERE

01:45:15.142 --> 01:45:17.544
CONTENT CAN BE STORED SO THAT

01:45:17.611 --> 01:45:18.311
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE STORED ON

01:45:18.378 --> 01:45:21.882
YOUR DEVICE. BUT IT HAS STATE

01:45:21.948 --> 01:45:23.917
AT ALL THAT CONTENT HAS TO GET

01:45:23.984 --> 01:45:25.819
OVER THE NETWORK SO IF YOU

01:45:25.886 --> 01:45:28.455
COULD BUILD. MANY CLOUDS CLOSER

01:45:28.522 --> 01:45:29.990
TO THE EDGE OF THE NETWORK.

01:45:30.057 --> 01:45:31.458
BACK FURTHER WITH THE EIGHT

01:45:31.525 --> 01:45:33.427
CURRENCIES A FIVE G. REALLY IT

01:45:33.493 --> 01:45:35.996
CAN DELIVER- MASSIVE TAG

01:45:36.063 --> 01:45:37.364
KRUGMAN'S FOR INDUSTRY AND I

01:45:37.431 --> 01:45:39.132
JUST SAW A COMMERCIAL. I TALK

01:45:39.199 --> 01:45:41.301
ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT WAYS

01:45:41.368 --> 01:45:43.303
THAT. A W. S. AT MOBILE EDGE

01:45:43.370 --> 01:45:48.141
COMPUTE. ARE ATTACKING PEOPLE'S

01:45:48.208 --> 01:45:50.410
LIVES RIGHT NOW I MEAN THIS IS

01:45:50.477 --> 01:45:51.678
FOR THE OTHERS THAT WOULD

01:45:51.745 --> 01:45:53.613
RESULT THERE'S THEY BECOME

01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:54.915
MISSOURI ABOUT AT COMPUTING

01:45:54.981 --> 01:45:55.549
WHICH YOU WERE WERE PARTNERING

01:45:55.615 --> 01:45:57.050
WITH MICROSOFT YOU WERE WHICH

01:45:57.117 --> 01:45:58.285
IS A COMPETITOR TO AMAZON BUT

01:45:58.351 --> 01:45:59.720
THERE KIND OF OFFERING VERY

01:45:59.786 --> 01:46:01.688
SIMILAR FROM SO MOVING THAT

01:46:01.755 --> 01:46:03.156
COMPUTE FUNCTIONALITY CLOSER TO

01:46:03.223 --> 01:46:04.191
THE EDGE WHICH WILL ALLOW ALL

01:46:04.257 --> 01:46:05.625
OF THE SERVICE PROVIDERS ALL

01:46:05.692 --> 01:46:06.893
THE THREE NATIONAL CARRIERS

01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:07.627
WILL BE ABLE TO INTRODUCE A LOT

01:46:07.694 --> 01:46:09.062
OF THAT FUNCTIONALITY I THINK.

01:46:09.129 --> 01:46:10.897
I THINK- AND WANTED TO COMPETE

01:46:10.964 --> 01:46:11.431
WITH EACH OTHER FOR THAT

01:46:11.498 --> 01:46:13.633
BUSINESS I THINK OVERALL I KIND

01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:15.135
OF AGREE WITH- TECHNICAL FALL

01:46:15.202 --> 01:46:16.436
HERE THAT YOU KNOW IT SEEMS TO

01:46:16.503 --> 01:46:17.671
ME THAT WHAT WE'LL SEE IS A LOT

01:46:17.738 --> 01:46:20.073
OF ENTERPRISE FIVE G. ROLLOUT

01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:20.807
AND THEN ULTIMATELY AS THOSE

01:46:20.874 --> 01:46:21.975
APPLICATIONS REDUCE THE

01:46:22.042 --> 01:46:23.910
STRUCTURAL DOWN DOWN MARKETS

01:46:23.977 --> 01:46:25.679
OTHER. OTHER SEGMENTS YOU KNOW

01:46:25.746 --> 01:46:27.180
I THINK- YOU KNOW YOU SEE SOME

01:46:27.247 --> 01:46:28.482
OF THESE USE CASES EMERGE AND

01:46:28.548 --> 01:46:30.317
THEN USERS WILL WILL PICK UP ON

01:46:30.383 --> 01:46:31.618
THIS TEAM SAID IN A LITTLE

01:46:31.685 --> 01:46:33.286
START AFFECT OTHER. OTHER

01:46:33.353 --> 01:46:34.187
ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS BUT

01:46:34.254 --> 01:46:35.021
SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE NOT

01:46:35.088 --> 01:46:35.889
NECESSARILY JUST LIMITED

01:46:35.956 --> 01:46:37.023
ENTERPRISES RIGHTS TO SOME OF

01:46:37.090 --> 01:46:37.791
THE THINGS THAT MEASURE EARLIER

01:46:37.858 --> 01:46:39.192
LIKE LIKE DRONES ARE USED IN A

01:46:39.259 --> 01:46:40.827
LOT OF APPLICATIONS ARE NOT

01:46:40.894 --> 01:46:41.595
JUST ENTERPRISE APPLICATIONS AS

01:46:41.661 --> 01:46:42.896
OUR- SO THESE OTHER

01:46:42.963 --> 01:46:44.131
TECHNOLOGIES SO IT'LL BE

01:46:44.197 --> 01:46:45.966
INTERESTING TO SEE. ULTIMATELY

01:46:46.032 --> 01:46:47.768
HOW THAT ROLLS OUT BUT I THINK

01:46:47.834 --> 01:46:49.903
MOST BUSINESSES ARE SURELY THE

01:46:49.970 --> 01:46:51.238
ENTERPRISE SPACE WE GET TONS OF

01:46:51.304 --> 01:46:52.372
QUESTIONS ABOUT FIVE G. AS IN

01:46:52.439 --> 01:46:53.874
MY- YES I WOULD SAY THAT

01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:54.775
THEY'RE THEY'RE PRETTY AWARE OF

01:46:54.841 --> 01:46:57.043
WHAT'S GOING ON THERE- YOU KNOW

01:46:57.110 --> 01:47:03.150
WE'LL WE'LL SEE HOW IT PLAYS.

01:47:03.216 --> 01:47:03.784
OUT IS THAT THESE THINGS REDUCE

01:47:03.850 --> 01:47:04.818
I THANK YOU FOR. MUCH BELIEVE I

01:47:04.885 --> 01:47:06.386
HEARD THE TERM SMART SIT BE

01:47:06.453 --> 01:47:07.154
BEING MENTIONED BY ONE OF

01:47:07.220 --> 01:47:08.622
PANELISTS THE QUESTION IS IN

01:47:08.688 --> 01:47:10.357
THE CREATION OF SMART CITY

01:47:10.423 --> 01:47:11.458
TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE

01:47:11.525 --> 01:47:13.293
DEVELOPED. TO MAKE

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:13.860
DETERMINATIONS ABOUT

01:47:13.927 --> 01:47:16.897
INDIVIDUALS. HOW DOES. THE FIVE

01:47:16.963 --> 01:47:18.565
G. TECHNOLOGY ADDRESS ISSUES

01:47:18.632 --> 01:47:21.268
LIKE BIASES. ARE WHETHER IT IS

01:47:21.334 --> 01:47:24.905
RACIAL BIAS. OR AGENDA BIAS OR

01:47:24.971 --> 01:47:28.275
ANY KIND OF- BIASES. I THINK

01:47:28.341 --> 01:47:30.143
THIS IS A PROBLEM OF PIZZA- I

01:47:30.210 --> 01:47:32.846
AND DONALD I DO NOT NECESSARILY

01:47:32.913 --> 01:47:34.548
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO THAT GIVE

01:47:34.614 --> 01:47:36.483
IT TO US. I THINK THE FIGHT

01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:37.651
DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING THE

01:47:37.717 --> 01:47:41.087
DETECTION PRACTICES. WELL I

01:47:41.154 --> 01:47:45.625
NINETEEN BECAUSE. IT THESE

01:47:45.692 --> 01:47:47.561
SCHOOLS THAT ARE PROVIDED AND I

01:47:47.627 --> 01:47:49.095
THINK IN BEFORE OCTOBER

01:47:49.162 --> 01:47:50.363
INTELLIGENCE MAY LEARNING I ARE

01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:51.865
GOING TO BE FEATURED HEAVILY IN

01:47:51.932 --> 01:47:55.068
TRYING TO DRIVE USE FROM THAT

01:47:55.135 --> 01:47:57.637
THAT IS BEING RIGHT WHAT WE

01:47:57.704 --> 01:48:02.142
HAVE TO BE SEVERAL OF HIS

01:48:02.209 --> 01:48:04.911
OFFICE THE NUMBER BEAGLE OR THE

01:48:04.978 --> 01:48:07.848
UNDER THE BE UNDER I RECORD AND

01:48:07.914 --> 01:48:10.283
I AND THE EXTRA I POTENTIAL THE

01:48:10.350 --> 01:48:12.819
MIGHT BE THAT NO ONE PLACE IDEA

01:48:12.886 --> 01:48:15.322
THAT THIS IS RUNNING FIVE G. IS

01:48:15.388 --> 01:48:17.991
A DOESN'T LOOK UP TO ME ALSO BY

01:48:18.058 --> 01:48:20.760
CLOSE REELING ON AUG YEAH I AND

01:48:20.827 --> 01:48:21.995
MACHINE LEARNING TO HELP

01:48:22.062 --> 01:48:23.730
OPTIMIZE THE BILL'S GOING TO

01:48:23.797 --> 01:48:25.732
THEY CAN BE BY THEMSELVES AND

01:48:25.799 --> 01:48:27.400
SOME FRIENDS YOU COULD SAY I

01:48:27.467 --> 01:48:29.069
DON'T SEE I THINK IN THESE

01:48:29.135 --> 01:48:31.671
AREAS THAT SELECT ME BUT IS

01:48:31.738 --> 01:48:34.040
MADE HAVE COME AND IS OF THE

01:48:34.107 --> 01:48:37.210
HERE TO TALK DOES THE UNDER SO

01:48:37.277 --> 01:48:40.013
COMMUNITY BY ABOUT NOT GONNA

01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:41.781
PEOPLE THE QUOTE THAT WOULD BE

01:48:41.848 --> 01:48:43.049
GREAT BECAUSE I JUST DON'T

01:48:43.116 --> 01:48:45.852
NIGHT SO TO THAT CAN COME UP

01:48:45.919 --> 01:48:48.521
YES THEREFORE I THE KIND OF

01:48:48.588 --> 01:48:50.757
BIASES THAT NEED BE PRESENT IN

01:48:50.824 --> 01:48:53.360
DATA THAT THE C. IF FOREST

01:48:53.426 --> 01:48:56.263
TRAINING THEM OUR RECORDS BUT I

01:48:56.329 --> 01:48:58.265
BUT RECOGNITION IS THE FOR PART

01:48:58.331 --> 01:49:00.300
AMERICAN ON THE HUMANS OF THIS

01:49:00.367 --> 01:49:01.234
TO. THE SITE INTO MUST BE

01:49:01.301 --> 01:49:04.437
DISMISSED AND MAKES THE DENTIST

01:49:04.504 --> 01:49:05.805
THAT LICENSE MAY LIST AND LEARN

01:49:05.872 --> 01:49:07.707
TO LOOK FOR THEM BEFORE THAT I

01:49:07.774 --> 01:49:09.242
RELEASED FROM THE TRAINING

01:49:09.309 --> 01:49:11.211
OTHER THAN SOME OF THE DATA I

01:49:11.278 --> 01:49:11.778
THINK YOU WILL BE IN A MUCH

01:49:11.845 --> 01:49:24.524
PLACE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR

01:49:24.591 --> 01:49:27.961
OKAY GREAT I WOULD JUST I WOULD

01:49:28.028 --> 01:49:28.728
IS THAT THE YOU KNOW THERE I

01:49:28.795 --> 01:49:29.362
DON'T THINK IT'S A UNIQUE FIVE

01:49:29.429 --> 01:49:30.764
G. BUT I THE IDEA OF A AYE AM

01:49:30.830 --> 01:49:32.098
IN THE YOU OBVIOUSLY RAISES THE

01:49:32.165 --> 01:49:32.999
OF AND THERE'S BEEN A THERE'S

01:49:33.066 --> 01:49:34.200
BEEN ONGOING DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:49:34.267 --> 01:49:34.801
WHAT I'LL CALL THE ETHICAL YOU

01:49:34.868 --> 01:49:36.836
OF AI IN THIS TIMES TO CHECK

01:49:36.903 --> 01:49:38.138
SOMETHING I KNOW EIGHTEEN WE

01:49:38.204 --> 01:49:38.939
HAVE A DON'T I DON'T KNOW THIS

01:49:39.005 --> 01:49:39.539
FOR BUT THERE'S ANOTHER GROUP

01:49:39.606 --> 01:49:40.941
THE COMPANY HAS BEEN LOOKING AT

01:49:41.007 --> 01:49:42.442
THIS ARTIFICE TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:49:42.509 --> 01:49:44.110
YOU KNOW AS WE THOSE OF FROM

01:49:44.177 --> 01:49:45.211
THE FISHING SEASON THE NETWORK

01:49:45.278 --> 01:49:46.379
AND I MENTIONED EARLIER YOU

01:49:46.446 --> 01:49:47.614
KNOW ONE OF THE USE CASES FOR

01:49:47.681 --> 01:49:50.350
AI AND ML IT IS SECURITY- IN

01:49:50.417 --> 01:49:51.284
THOSE TYPES OF THINGS THAT IT

01:49:51.351 --> 01:49:52.385
DOCUMENTS SECURE UNETHICAL

01:49:52.452 --> 01:49:54.487
MANNER SO. I THINK THAT'S A

01:49:54.554 --> 01:49:55.655
VERY INTERESTING TOPIC THERE'S

01:49:55.722 --> 01:49:56.589
BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION HERE

01:49:56.656 --> 01:49:58.858
IN DC ABOUT EXACTLY HOW HOW TO

01:49:58.925 --> 01:49:59.960
DO THAT I KNOW IT'S AN ONGOING

01:50:00.026 --> 01:50:01.428
CONCERN A LOT OF IT IS NOT

01:50:01.494 --> 01:50:02.929
UNIQUE TO FIVE G. IT'S KIND OF

01:50:02.996 --> 01:50:04.364
A COMPASS IS ALL OF THE USE OF

01:50:04.431 --> 01:50:06.166
A. I. AND ALL WHICH REALLY IS.

01:50:06.232 --> 01:50:07.600
YOU KNOW SPANS FIVE G. BUT ALSO

01:50:07.667 --> 01:50:09.302
CLOUD NETWORKS AND APPLICATIONS

01:50:09.369 --> 01:50:11.604
ETCETERA SO- IT'S AN ONGOING

01:50:11.671 --> 01:50:12.639
DISCUSSION AND I THINK

01:50:12.706 --> 01:50:13.206
SOMETHING THAT THAT'S WHAT

01:50:13.273 --> 01:50:14.441
THAT'S GOING TO BE. REALLY A

01:50:14.507 --> 01:50:19.512
KEY CONCERN. FOR ALL THE

01:50:19.579 --> 01:50:20.113
COMPANIES INVOLVED HERE GOING

01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:20.613
FORWARD THANK CHRISTMAS

01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:21.748
CHAIRMAN I ADD IT FROM FROM A

01:50:21.815 --> 01:50:24.684
DEPLOYMENT ASPECT- YOU KNOW I

01:50:24.751 --> 01:50:27.287
TALKED ABOUT- FIVE G.

01:50:27.354 --> 01:50:29.255
TECHNOLOGY BEING POISED TO.

01:50:29.322 --> 01:50:31.758
SOLVE THE LAST MILE PROBLEM IN

01:50:31.825 --> 01:50:33.994
LARGE PART. NOW YOU KNOW. ALL

01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:35.328
THERE ARE GOING TO BE POCKETS.

01:50:35.395 --> 01:50:38.264
OF OUR STATE. THAT ARE SO

01:50:38.331 --> 01:50:40.600
REMOTE AND SO CHALLENGING. THAT

01:50:40.667 --> 01:50:43.570
A HUNDRED PERCENT- BUILD OUT-

01:50:43.636 --> 01:50:45.271
IS NOT GOING TO BE- POSSIBLE

01:50:45.338 --> 01:50:47.574
BUT- IN LARGE PART. UBIQUITOUS

01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:50.610
DEPLOYMENT. IS THE GOAL. AND IS

01:50:50.677 --> 01:50:52.112
THE INTENTION OF THESE.

01:50:52.178 --> 01:50:54.080
NETWORKS UTILIZING BOTH. THE

01:50:54.147 --> 01:50:56.883
HIGH BAND AND- THE MID BAND

01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:58.618
SPECTRUM IN COMBINATION WITH.

01:50:58.685 --> 01:51:00.754
THE MASSIVE FIBER- BACK CALLS

01:51:00.820 --> 01:51:02.722
I. AND TRANSPORT I WOULD SAY

01:51:02.789 --> 01:51:06.359
THAT. THESE DEVICES THAT WE

01:51:06.426 --> 01:51:08.128
HAVE RIGHT THEY ARE AGNOSTIC TO

01:51:08.194 --> 01:51:11.331
THE USER RIGHT THE NETWORK.

01:51:11.398 --> 01:51:13.233
WHEN YOU'RE GOING AROUND JUST

01:51:13.299 --> 01:51:14.200
TO SEE IS THAT THERE IS A

01:51:14.267 --> 01:51:17.103
DEVICE REQUESTING ACCESS TO IT.

01:51:17.170 --> 01:51:19.239
AND SO WHAT ARE ENGINEERS DO IN

01:51:19.305 --> 01:51:21.541
BUILDING OUT THE RADIO ACCESS

01:51:21.608 --> 01:51:24.511
NETWORK IS THEY BUILD WHERE

01:51:24.577 --> 01:51:25.812
WIRELESS GOES WHERE THE PEOPLE

01:51:25.879 --> 01:51:28.715
GO RIGHT. YOU HAVE TO BUILD

01:51:28.782 --> 01:51:32.285
BASED ON THE DENSITY OF OF

01:51:32.352 --> 01:51:35.989
USAGE. AND I THINK THAT AS WE

01:51:36.056 --> 01:51:37.824
BUILD OUT THESE NETWORKS I

01:51:37.891 --> 01:51:40.627
WOULDUNDERSCORE THE URGENCY OF

01:51:40.693 --> 01:51:41.828
YOUR QUESTION TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:51:41.895 --> 01:51:44.297
WE ADDRESS ISSUES TO MAKE SURE

01:51:44.364 --> 01:51:46.499
THAT- WE'RE BUILDING OUT NOT

01:51:46.566 --> 01:51:48.802
ONLY IN TERMS OF LOWER INCOME

01:51:48.868 --> 01:51:52.172
AND SOCIO ECONOMICALLY-

01:51:52.238 --> 01:51:54.707
DEPRESSED COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO

01:51:54.774 --> 01:51:56.342
IN TERMS OF RACIAL EQUITY THERE

01:51:56.409 --> 01:51:59.479
IS A COMPONENT IF YOU LOOK AT.

01:51:59.546 --> 01:52:02.082
THE DATA YOU CAN'T JUST LOOK AT

01:52:02.148 --> 01:52:04.451
WHERE THE LOW INCOME- PEOPLE

01:52:04.517 --> 01:52:06.453
ARE YOU ALSO HAVE TO LOOK FOR

01:52:06.519 --> 01:52:09.556
MY CRITICAL RACE A PERSPECTIVE.

01:52:09.622 --> 01:52:10.690
WHERE ARE VULNERABLE

01:52:10.757 --> 01:52:12.959
POPULATIONS ARE AND MAKE SURE

01:52:13.026 --> 01:52:15.061
THAT THESE NETWORKS DO GET

01:52:15.128 --> 01:52:17.163
DEPLOYED UBIQUITOUSLY BUT THE

01:52:17.230 --> 01:52:19.532
DEVICES THEMSELVES ARE TOTALLY

01:52:19.599 --> 01:52:23.703
AGNOSTIC TO WHO THE USER IS

01:52:23.770 --> 01:52:24.237
IT'S JUST DEVICE TRYING TO

01:52:24.304 --> 01:52:26.106
CONNECT TO THE NETWORK GOT IT I

01:52:26.172 --> 01:52:28.274
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR YOUR

01:52:28.341 --> 01:52:30.643
PRESENTATION SO I THINK THOSE

01:52:30.710 --> 01:52:32.045
ARE THE ONLY QUESTIONS OUT THAT

01:52:32.112 --> 01:52:34.447
I HAVE AT THIS POINT- SO THAT

01:52:34.514 --> 01:52:36.649
BRINGS US TO THE NEXT PANEL. OF

01:52:36.716 --> 01:52:38.618
THE TOPIC OF THAT IS BUILDING

01:53:52.525 --> 01:53:54.460
LOOK AT THE DEPLOYMENT OF FIVE

01:53:54.527 --> 01:53:56.095
G. INFRASTRUCTURE TO THE

01:53:56.162 --> 01:53:57.597
ALREADY EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE

01:53:57.664 --> 01:54:00.433
THAT WE HAVE. IS AS TECHNOLOGY

01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:02.635
ADVANCES WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO

01:54:02.702 --> 01:54:04.871
UPGRADE- THE FACILITIES THAT WE

01:54:04.938 --> 01:54:07.373
CURRENTLY HAVE AND IN SOME

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:09.275
CASES IN LOCATIONS WHERE WE DO

01:54:09.342 --> 01:54:11.277
NOT HAVE FACILITIES WE WOULD

01:54:11.344 --> 01:54:13.179
HAVE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR

01:54:13.246 --> 01:54:15.315
NOT WE WOULD NEED TO- PLACE THE

01:54:15.381 --> 01:54:17.217
NEW FACILITY BUT FOR THE MOST

01:54:17.283 --> 01:54:18.751
PART. WHEN IT COMES TO THE FIVE

01:54:18.818 --> 01:54:20.587
G. UPGRADES A MANY OF THE

01:54:20.653 --> 01:54:22.088
CARRIERS ARE LOOKING TO UPGRADE

01:54:22.155 --> 01:54:25.258
EXISTING FACILITIES- AND THAT

01:54:25.325 --> 01:54:28.394
WOULD CONSIST OF- ANTENNA ADS.

01:54:28.461 --> 01:54:30.997
RADIO ADS AND B. STATION-

01:54:31.064 --> 01:54:33.466
UPGRADES- ALONG WITH SOMETHING

01:54:33.533 --> 01:54:35.134
THAT I THOUGHT WAS REALLY GOOD

01:54:35.201 --> 01:54:36.603
THAT RUDY ADDED IN THE LAST

01:54:36.669 --> 01:54:39.005
PANEL- WE ALSO HAVE TO

01:54:39.072 --> 01:54:41.207
CONSIDER- BACK CALL WHEN WE'RE

01:54:41.274 --> 01:54:43.509
DOING THESE UPGRADES TO FIVE G.

01:54:43.576 --> 01:54:45.378
AND RUDY I'M NOT GONNA TOUCH

01:54:45.445 --> 01:54:46.746
TOO MUCH ON THAT LAST NOW

01:54:46.813 --> 01:54:47.914
BECAUSE I THINK HE DID A VERY

01:54:47.981 --> 01:54:50.116
NICE JOB IN. COVERING THAT- BUT

01:54:50.183 --> 01:54:52.018
I WOULD SAY THAT- WHEN WE'RE

01:54:52.085 --> 01:54:54.053
DEPLOYING FIVE G. AND EVEN

01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:56.589
FORTY- BACK CALL IS DEFINITELY

01:54:56.656 --> 01:54:58.157
SOMETHING THAT WE CONSIDER AND

01:54:58.224 --> 01:55:03.930
WE NEED TO UPGRADE ALONG. THE

01:55:03.997 --> 01:55:05.131
WAY- ONE OF THE THINGS I IS

01:55:05.198 --> 01:55:06.866
IMPORTANT TO. OUT AND TO ADD IN

01:55:06.933 --> 01:55:08.768
IT JUST TO WHAT HE HAD STATED

01:55:08.835 --> 01:55:10.703
THAT NOT ALL CARE YOUR HAVE

01:55:10.770 --> 01:55:13.039
THEIR OWN BACK CENTER IN SOME

01:55:13.106 --> 01:55:15.441
THEY ARE ADEPT ON THIRD

01:55:15.508 --> 01:55:17.377
PARTIES- TWO WEEKS STEP BACK

01:55:17.443 --> 01:55:21.147
CALL FROM. AND SO- THAT CREATES

01:55:21.214 --> 01:55:23.850
A NEED FOR US TO HAVE SOMETIMES

01:55:23.916 --> 01:55:29.055
HAVE TO DEPEND ON- PERMITTING

01:55:29.122 --> 01:55:31.391
JERSEY IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE

01:55:31.457 --> 01:55:34.861
THAT THAT HAPPENS- AND WE CAN

01:55:34.927 --> 01:55:37.163
IN THE FUTURE DO SMART PLANNING

01:55:37.230 --> 01:55:39.032
DECISIONS THAT HELP HELP WITH

01:55:39.098 --> 01:55:40.199
THAT SO I'LL EXPLAIN THAT IN A

01:55:40.266 --> 01:55:43.803
SECOND BUT IS FAR FIVE GT-

01:55:43.870 --> 01:55:48.675
NETWORKS AND CARRIERS- LOOK AT

01:55:48.741 --> 01:55:51.244
DOMINATION OF THE SITE IN THERE

01:55:51.311 --> 01:55:53.446
NOW SO FOR THE MOST PART- WE

01:55:53.513 --> 01:55:54.881
HAVE WHAT IS CALLED THE MATTER

01:55:54.947 --> 01:55:57.350
SITE- LARGER DEPLOYMENTS WE

01:55:57.417 --> 01:55:58.951
HAVE SMALL CELLS THAT AND

01:55:59.018 --> 01:56:00.219
SOMETIMES ARE FOUND IN THE

01:56:00.286 --> 01:56:02.021
PUBLIC RIGHT AWAY. AND THEN WE

01:56:02.088 --> 01:56:04.657
HAVE DASCOM'S THAT ARE FOUND IN

01:56:04.724 --> 01:56:07.994
OUR EVENT SPACES- WE NEED WHEN

01:56:08.061 --> 01:56:09.629
WE'RE DECIDING WHAT TO EAT-

01:56:09.696 --> 01:56:12.198
DEPLOYED IN THOSE APPLICATIONS

01:56:12.265 --> 01:56:13.266
WE LOOK AT THE COVERAGE AND

01:56:13.333 --> 01:56:15.335
CAPACITY NEEDS AND READING ALSO

01:56:15.401 --> 01:56:17.103
MENTIONED THAT THE LAST PANEL

01:56:17.170 --> 01:56:18.104
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS GOOD. THEN

01:56:18.171 --> 01:56:19.706
WHEN WE'RE DECIDING ON HOW TO

01:56:19.772 --> 01:56:21.007
DESIGN THE NETWORK OR WHAT TO

01:56:21.074 --> 01:56:22.942
DEPLOY WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:56:23.009 --> 01:56:24.977
POPULATION DENSITY AND ALSO AT

01:56:25.044 --> 01:56:26.312
THE USERS THAT MIGHT BE ON THE

01:56:26.379 --> 01:56:30.950
NETWORK WHEN WE'RE MAKING THOSE.

01:56:31.017 --> 01:56:34.620
DECISIONS- WHEN WE'RE UP THESE

01:56:34.687 --> 01:56:36.656
AT THIS THANK BE IN VARIOUS

01:56:36.723 --> 01:56:38.391
LOOKING SOME ARE OBVIOUSLY LOOK

AREAS AND AS I MENTIONED EVENT

01:56:42.295 --> 01:56:46.132
SPACES- SO ONE OF THE THINGS

01:56:46.199 --> 01:56:48.201
THAT- AS FAR AS NETWORK AND

01:56:48.267 --> 01:56:49.435
FIND A FIVE JEAN DOING

01:56:49.502 --> 01:56:51.771
EXPEDITIOUSLY. AND THAT WE CAN

01:56:51.838 --> 01:56:54.607
CONSIDER GOING FOR IN FUTURE IS

01:56:54.674 --> 01:56:57.009
SMART PLANNING SO LOOKING AT

01:56:57.076 --> 01:56:59.712
WHERE WE WANT. THE TECHNOLOGY

01:56:59.779 --> 01:57:01.381
TO GO INTO THE CHURCH AND

01:57:01.447 --> 01:57:02.715
MAKING SURE THAT WHEN WE'RE

DOING OUR PLANNING AND WORK-

01:57:05.051 --> 01:57:06.719
SUBMITTING TO JURISDICTIONS ARE

01:57:06.786 --> 01:57:07.887
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT WE'RE

01:57:09.789 --> 01:57:11.591
DO YOU TO ANTICIPATE WHAT IS

01:57:11.657 --> 01:57:14.861
COMING NEXT AND THAT COULD BE-

01:57:14.927 --> 01:57:16.396
UNDER A SMART PLAY ANY MODEL

01:57:16.462 --> 01:57:17.463
WHERE YOU PARTNER WITH

01:57:17.530 --> 01:57:19.665
JURISDICTIONS TO DETERMINE.

01:57:19.732 --> 01:57:20.933
WHAT COULD BE PROVIDED IN

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.069
ADVANCE OF THE TECHNOLOGY BEING

01:57:23.136 --> 01:57:24.737
ADDED TO THE SITE SO THAT IT

01:57:24.804 --> 01:57:26.172
WOULD CUT DOWN ON THE TIME THAT

01:57:26.239 --> 01:57:27.874
WE TAKE TO GO THROUGH THE

01:57:27.940 --> 01:57:31.644
PERMITTING PROCESS- ANOTHER

01:57:31.711 --> 01:57:32.278
THING THAT WAS MENTIONED ON THE

01:57:32.345 --> 01:57:33.279
PANEL THAT I THINK IT'S-

01:57:33.346 --> 01:57:34.981
IMPORTANT TO REITERATE. IS

01:57:35.047 --> 01:57:38.751
THAT- FIVE G. IS IT CANCER

01:57:38.818 --> 01:57:45.091

UPGRADES IS THAT- SPIKY SPEEDS

01:58:17.890 --> 01:58:21.294
ARE FASTER AS MENTIONED BEFORE-

01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:23.529
LATENCY ISN'T IMPROVED AND SO

01:58:23.596 --> 01:58:24.597

OPTIONS BUT I WANTED TO MENTION

02:00:03.396 --> 02:00:04.764
THAT BECAUSE THERE'S A LAYER

02:00:04.830 --> 02:00:06.666
APPROACH TO FIVE G. DEPLOYMENTS

02:00:06.732 --> 02:00:08.534
AND NETWORKS AND SO IT'S A LOW

02:00:08.601 --> 02:00:12.204

02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:29.155
COMMISSION CLARIFIED AND HAS

02:00:29.221 --> 02:00:31.624
MODIFIED A KEY ELEMENTS OF

INFRASTRUCTURE REGULATION

02:00:33.025 --> 02:00:34.293
OBVIOUSLY AT THE STATE AND

02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:35.628
LOCAL LEVELS WE NEED THE

02:00:35.695 --> 02:00:38.998

DEPLOY A FIVE G. EXPEDITIOUSLY

02:00:49.408 --> 02:00:51.344
I'M SOME OF THE WAYS THAT WE

02:00:51.410 --> 02:00:53.012
LOOK AT AS THE WIRELESS

02:00:53.079 --> 02:00:55.715
INDUSTRY TO BE ABLE TO PARTNER

02:00:55.781 --> 02:00:57.783
WITH A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO

02:00:57.850 --> 02:01:00.252
BE ABLE DEPLOY. QUICKLY AS

02:01:00.319 --> 02:01:03.889
POSSIBLE IS- WE REALLY WANT TO

02:01:03.956 --> 02:01:05.057
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BALANCING

02:01:05.124 --> 02:01:06.626
THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY

02:01:06.692 --> 02:01:08.427
AGAINST THE NEEDS OF THE

02:01:08.494 --> 02:01:09.962
WIRELESS INDUSTRY AND ALSO

02:01:10.029 --> 02:01:11.631
MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN DEPLOY

02:01:11.697 --> 02:01:14.433
QUICKLY- SOME AREAS IN WHICH

02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:15.868
WE'VE SEEN THAT IT'S THEIR VERY

02:01:15.935 --> 02:01:17.770
IT'S VERY POSITIVE. FOR US TO

02:01:17.837 --> 02:01:19.872
MOVE FORWARD EXPEDITIOUSLY IS

02:01:19.939 --> 02:01:21.574
MIND JURISDICTIONS CONSIDER

02:01:21.641 --> 02:01:23.943
OBVIOUSLY FROM AN AESTHETIC

02:01:24.010 --> 02:01:26.479
IMPACT THAT CERTAIN FACILITIES

02:01:26.545 --> 02:01:27.980
ARE ALREADY CONCEALED ARE

02:01:28.047 --> 02:01:30.916
ALREADY ARE BEHIND SCREENING-

02:01:30.983 --> 02:01:32.985
AND THEREFORE AND THE POINT

02:01:33.052 --> 02:01:35.588
QUICKLY THROUGH HAVING A-

02:01:35.655 --> 02:01:37.556
SHORTENED REVIEW PROCESS IS

02:01:37.623 --> 02:01:38.858
VERY HELPFUL WHEN YOU'RE TRYING

02:01:38.924 --> 02:01:41.193
TO. GET FIVE G. MARKETS INTO

02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:43.529
MARKET AS FAST AS WE CAN SO

02:01:43.596 --> 02:01:45.031
PARTNERING WITH JURISDICTIONS

02:01:45.097 --> 02:01:45.965
AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY

02:01:46.032 --> 02:01:48.367
UNDERSTAND THAT WE DO HAVE GOOD

02:01:48.434 --> 02:01:51.237
FACILITIES THAT ARE ALREADY- IN

02:01:51.303 --> 02:01:52.838
IN THE JURISDICTIONS AND THAT

02:01:52.905 --> 02:01:54.173
THE UPGRADES THAT WERE ASKING

02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:56.008
FOR ARE GOING TO JUST BE A

02:01:56.075 --> 02:01:58.978
MINOR UPGRADES AND NOT. DO NOT

02:01:59.045 --> 02:02:00.846
HAVE AN AESTHETIC IMPACT AND

02:02:00.913 --> 02:02:03.983
SHOULD BE DEPLOYED QUICKLY- I'M

02:02:04.050 --> 02:02:05.985
ALSO LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE

02:02:06.052 --> 02:02:07.753
SMART I THINK IT'S A GREAT OUR

02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:09.188
NUMBER JURISDICTIONS I THINK

02:02:09.255 --> 02:02:11.157
IT'S VERY HELPFUL TO DEPLOY

02:02:11.223 --> 02:02:12.892
FIVE G. AS FAST AS WE CAN AND

02:02:12.958 --> 02:02:14.994
THAT WOULD BE TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:02:15.061 --> 02:02:16.896
IN ADVANCE STEP UP AS THE

02:02:16.962 --> 02:02:18.431
TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO GROW ON

02:02:18.497 --> 02:02:19.732
THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS THAT

02:02:19.799 --> 02:02:21.233
I MENTIONED BEFORE THAT WE

02:02:21.300 --> 02:02:31.343
PLANNED- FOR MAYBE. CALL. AND-

02:02:31.410 --> 02:02:32.578
THAT THE STREET MAYBE WITH

02:02:32.645 --> 02:02:34.513
STREETS OVER UP YOU KNOW

02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:35.781
STREETS WE DETERMINED THAT

02:02:35.848 --> 02:02:36.816
THERE MY BE AND I FOR US TO

02:02:36.882 --> 02:02:38.017
PROVIDE THE FACT HALL THERE

02:02:38.084 --> 02:02:40.786
WERE IN THE IS A SMALL CELLS

02:02:40.853 --> 02:02:43.055
ATTEND ARMS OWNED EACH WE HAVE

02:02:43.122 --> 02:02:44.156
COSTS FACT WAYS TO BE ABLE TO

02:02:44.223 --> 02:02:46.492
DO THAT BY GETTING BACK IN

02:02:46.559 --> 02:02:47.793
FIRST READY FOR- WHAT WILL

02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:49.395
BECOME YEAH NOW AND THOSE ARE

02:02:49.462 --> 02:02:50.896
SOWAYS TO PARTNER WITH THE

02:02:50.963 --> 02:02:53.432
LOCAL ENTITIES TO ENSURE THAT

02:02:53.499 --> 02:02:56.035
WERE ABLE TO W. G. TECHNOLOGIES

02:02:56.102 --> 02:03:00.339
BUT HIS AND IN SOME CASES-

02:03:00.406 --> 02:03:02.141
ALTHOUGH WE KNOW THAT THINGS

02:03:02.208 --> 02:03:04.276
CHANGE- AND WE ALL HAVE TO BE

02:03:04.343 --> 02:03:09.315
AGILE- LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WORK

02:03:09.381 --> 02:03:11.350
WITH THE SOMETIMES IT'S THINGS

02:03:11.417 --> 02:03:12.318
IT'S GOOD TO PARTNER THEM TO

02:03:12.384 --> 02:03:14.820
MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT

02:03:14.887 --> 02:03:16.956
NEW RULES AND POLICIES QUICKLY-

02:03:17.022 --> 02:03:19.191
SO THAT WE'RE ABLE TO DEPLOY AS

02:03:19.258 --> 02:03:21.127
FAST AS YOU CAN FOR THE

02:03:21.193 --> 02:03:23.028
WIRELESS INDUSTRY AND ALSO TO

02:03:23.095 --> 02:03:24.697
GET THE FULL BENEFITS OF WHAT

02:03:24.764 --> 02:03:27.099
FIVE G. CAN OFFER TO ASK. SO

02:03:27.166 --> 02:03:28.768
THOSE ARE THE MAIN POINTS THAT

02:03:28.834 --> 02:03:30.703
I WANTED TO HIT ON ON THIS FAR

02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:35.274

SPEAK TODAY. FIVE TWO MAIN

02:03:58.564 --> 02:04:01.133
POINTS I'D LIKE TO MAKE FIRST

02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:02.268
WE'VE HEARD TODAY ABOUT THE

02:04:02.334 --> 02:04:03.836
MANY BENEFITS FIVE G. WILL

02:04:03.903 --> 02:04:05.504
BRING TO CALIFORNIANS AND SAY

02:04:05.571 --> 02:04:07.206
COUNTIES ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE

02:04:07.273 --> 02:04:08.908
NEW POSSIBILITIES FIVE G. WILL

02:04:08.974 --> 02:04:11.577
BRING FOR PROVIDING GOVERNMENT

02:04:11.644 --> 02:04:13.078
SERVICES. M. BUT IT'S WORTH

02:04:13.145 --> 02:04:14.880
NOTING AS THE PREVIOUS

02:04:14.947 --> 02:04:16.515
PANELISTS HAVE THAT THESE

02:04:16.582 --> 02:04:18.450
BENEFITS CAN ONLY BE REALIZED

02:04:18.517 --> 02:04:19.485
IF THEY'RE SUFFICIENT FIBER

02:04:19.552 --> 02:04:21.153
AVAILABLE ALL INTERNET

02:04:21.220 --> 02:04:22.822
CONNECTIONS WHETHER WIRED OR

02:04:22.888 --> 02:04:25.090
MOBILE COME BACK TO FIGHT FOR.

02:04:25.157 --> 02:04:27.459
THE RIGHT NOW THOUGH MILLIONS

02:04:27.526 --> 02:04:30.095
OF CALIFORNIANS ARE WITHOUT ANY

02:04:30.162 --> 02:04:32.064
ACCESS TO BROADBAND FOR THAT

02:04:32.131 --> 02:04:34.567
EXACT REASON A LACK OF FIBER SO

02:04:34.633 --> 02:04:36.302
WHILE DEPLOYED IMPROVE

02:04:36.368 --> 02:04:37.770
TECHNOLOGY FOR THOSE WHO ARE

02:04:37.837 --> 02:04:39.338
ALREADY CONNECTED IS A GOOD

02:04:39.405 --> 02:04:41.607
THING. WE SHOULD KEEP THOSE

02:04:41.674 --> 02:04:47.613
BENEFITING IN CONTEXT. I IT IS

02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:49.181
AN ISSUE JULIE YOU IN RURAL

02:04:49.248 --> 02:04:51.083
AREA AND WELL AS URBAN THAT ARE

02:04:51.150 --> 02:04:54.854
ALL ACT JUST AND HISTORICALLY

02:04:54.920 --> 02:04:55.287
BEEN THE SUBJECT OF

02:04:55.354 --> 02:04:58.123
DISCRIMINATION. SB ONE FIFTY

02:04:58.190 --> 02:04:59.091
SIX THOUGH WHICH THE

02:04:59.158 --> 02:05:00.492
LEGISLATURE PASSED EARLIER THIS

02:05:00.559 --> 02:05:03.229
SUMMER WILL GO A LONG WAY

02:05:03.295 --> 02:05:05.698
EQUALIZING ACCESS BY BOTH-

02:05:05.764 --> 02:05:07.366
PROVIDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

02:05:07.433 --> 02:05:10.069
OF SUBSIDIES. FOR HIGH SPEED

02:05:10.135 --> 02:05:12.471
LAST MILE FIBRE INFRASTRUCTURE-

02:05:12.538 --> 02:05:15.541
BUT ALSO CRITICALLY BY BUILDING

02:05:15.608 --> 02:05:17.877
A STATE OWNED MIDDLE MILE FIBER

02:05:17.943 --> 02:05:20.045
NETWORK I THAT WILL BE OPEN TO

02:05:20.112 --> 02:05:21.247
ALL PROVIDERS ON NON

02:05:21.313 --> 02:05:23.449
DISCRIMINATORY TERMS. AND WHICH

02:05:23.515 --> 02:05:25.050
WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE

02:05:25.117 --> 02:05:27.419
COST AND THE TIME FOR THEM TO

02:05:27.486 --> 02:05:31.190
BUILD OUT THEIR NETWORKS TO ALL

02:05:31.257 --> 02:05:32.224
CALIFORNIANS I THE OTHER

02:05:32.291 --> 02:05:33.692
IMPORTANT ISSUE WOULD LIKE TO.

02:05:33.759 --> 02:05:35.628
IS THE QUESTION OF HOW TO

02:05:35.694 --> 02:05:37.763
BALANCE THE DESIRE FOR QUICK

02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:38.964
EXPANSION OF FIVE G.

02:05:39.031 --> 02:05:41.200
INFRASTRUCTURE WITH WITH BOTH

02:05:41.267 --> 02:05:42.835
THE LAND USE AUTHORITY IN

02:05:42.902 --> 02:05:45.004
PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS OF THE

02:05:45.070 --> 02:05:46.171
COUNTIES AND CITIES THAT ARE

02:05:46.238 --> 02:05:47.506
CHARGED WITH THOSE

02:05:47.573 --> 02:05:48.274
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THEIR

02:05:48.340 --> 02:05:51.777
COMMUNITIES- AND ALSO WITH OUR

02:05:51.844 --> 02:05:53.579
GENUINE DESIRE FOR COMMUNITIES.

02:05:53.646 --> 02:05:57.182
AT ALL OF THEM TO HAVE ACCESS

02:05:57.249 --> 02:05:59.184
TO HIGH SPEED SERVICE BY

02:05:59.251 --> 02:06:01.153
CONNECTING FIVE G. WITH THE

02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:03.722
POLICY LOOKING BACKWARD AS FAR

02:06:03.789 --> 02:06:06.592
AND THE PROVIDE BUILDING THIS

02:06:06.659 --> 02:06:08.527
INFRASTRUCTURE HIM IS SIMPLE

02:06:08.594 --> 02:06:10.829
PROMISE THAT THAT ADAM THESE

02:06:10.896 --> 02:06:12.765
EFFORTS AND VISIBLY THAT PERMIT

02:06:12.831 --> 02:06:14.233
STREAMLINING AND REDUCE

02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:16.835
REGULATIONS WILL LEAD NOT ONLY

02:06:16.902 --> 02:06:18.003
TO FASTER DEPLOYMENT BUT TO

02:06:18.070 --> 02:06:21.440
MORE WIDESPREAD DEPLOYMENT. AND

02:06:21.507 --> 02:06:22.775
SPECIFICALLY ROOT CANAL PER

02:06:22.841 --> 02:06:24.243
AREA THAT ARE CURRENTLY

02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:26.211
UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED YOU

02:06:26.278 --> 02:06:28.414
HEARD IT TODAY AT THAT FIVE G.

02:06:28.480 --> 02:06:31.250
WILL SOLVE THE LAST MILE PART

02:06:31.317 --> 02:06:33.419
OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE TO DO

02:06:33.485 --> 02:06:35.321
THAT THE DENSITY OF SMALL CELLS

02:06:35.387 --> 02:06:36.989
NECESSARY FOR FIVE G. TO WORK

02:06:37.056 --> 02:06:39.058
IS MUCH GREATER THE ARGUMENTS

02:06:39.124 --> 02:06:40.125
FOR UNFETTERED ACCESS TO

02:06:40.192 --> 02:06:41.660
UTILITY POLES AND TRAFFIC LIGHT

02:06:41.727 --> 02:06:43.295
POLES PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE

02:06:43.362 --> 02:06:45.431
LOCAL AGENCIES. BUT INCREASE

02:06:45.497 --> 02:06:47.533
DENSITY DOESN'T EXACTLY LEND

02:06:47.599 --> 02:06:49.635
ITSELF TO DEPLOYMENT IN AREAS

02:06:49.702 --> 02:06:51.503
WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE NOT

02:06:51.570 --> 02:06:55.774
DENSELY SO WHAT WILL FIVE G. BE

02:06:55.841 --> 02:06:56.942
THE ANSWER TO YOUR BIG WHAT IS

02:06:57.009 --> 02:06:59.545
BROADBAND IN RURAL AREAS OR AND

02:06:59.611 --> 02:07:01.513
OR OR SUBURBAN AREAS THAT ARE

02:07:01.580 --> 02:07:05.351
NOT DENSELY POPULATED M. AS THE

02:07:05.417 --> 02:07:06.719
PREVIOUS BALANCE THAT THE FCC

02:07:06.785 --> 02:07:08.687
HAS PROMULGATED REGULATIONS

02:07:08.754 --> 02:07:10.589
ONCE THE STATE IS AS EXPAND

02:07:10.656 --> 02:07:11.790
OURS CONSIDERING FURTHER

02:07:11.857 --> 02:07:14.293
EXPANSION OF. THE INCIDENT

02:07:14.360 --> 02:07:16.628
REDUCE MARKET BARRIERS AND

02:07:16.695 --> 02:07:18.330
INCENTIVIZE THE DEPLOYMENT OF A

02:07:18.397 --> 02:07:19.565
WIRELESS AND CABLE

02:07:19.631 --> 02:07:21.333
COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES THE

02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:24.370
FCC RULES PROVIDE FOR STRINGENT

02:07:24.436 --> 02:07:26.538
TIME LIMITS ARE SHOT CLOCKS THE

02:07:26.605 --> 02:07:28.707
CITING OF WIRELESS FACILITIES

02:07:28.774 --> 02:07:30.576
BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND IT

02:07:30.642 --> 02:07:32.344
REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

02:07:32.411 --> 02:07:34.246
ALLOW NON DISCRIMINATORY ACCESS

02:07:34.313 --> 02:07:35.981
TO PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE

02:07:36.048 --> 02:07:41.220
PUBLIC RIGHT AWAY- A TO AN

02:07:41.286 --> 02:07:42.287
UNPRECEDENTED DEGREE I'M SO I

02:07:42.354 --> 02:07:44.723
THINK THE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:45.758
WILL WANT TO KEEP IN MIND GOING

02:07:45.824 --> 02:07:48.093
FORWARD IS WHETHER THE

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:50.295
DEREGULATION THAT HAS BEEN

02:07:50.362 --> 02:07:52.965
GRANTED IN FACT RESULTS IN

02:07:53.032 --> 02:07:55.100
IMPROVED CONNECTIONS FOR THE-

02:07:55.167 --> 02:07:57.636
GROW AREAS FOR ECONOMICALLY

02:07:57.703 --> 02:08:00.005
DISADVANTAGED WORK ON THE

02:08:00.072 --> 02:08:02.474
CONTRARY IF. WHETHER DEPLOYMENT

02:08:02.541 --> 02:08:04.243
IS LARGELY CENTERED IN

02:08:04.309 --> 02:08:05.110
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ALREADY

02:08:05.177 --> 02:08:06.879
WELL CONNECTED WITH ANY OTHER

02:08:06.945 --> 02:08:08.847
AREAS EVEN FARTHER BEHIND

02:08:08.914 --> 02:08:11.250
BECAUSE- FRANKLY WHEN CARD IS

02:08:11.316 --> 02:08:12.651
EXACT SAME ARGUMENTS IN THE

02:08:12.718 --> 02:08:14.620
PAST WE HEARD OF FOR EXAMPLE

02:08:14.686 --> 02:08:16.055
WITH THE PASSAGE OF OBJECT THAT

02:08:16.121 --> 02:08:17.689
THE DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO

02:08:17.756 --> 02:08:19.625
BE A COMPETITION ACT IN TWO

02:08:19.691 --> 02:08:21.660
THOUSAND SIX. AND THE RESULTS

02:08:21.727 --> 02:08:24.029
DID NOT EXACTLY LIVE UP TO THE

02:08:24.096 --> 02:08:25.964
PROMISES AND UBIQUITOUS ACCESS

02:08:26.031 --> 02:08:29.802
CHEAPER SERVICE AND MORE

02:08:29.868 --> 02:08:31.437
COMPETITION. IN SO IF FIVE G.

02:08:31.503 --> 02:08:32.971
DEPLOYMENT FOLLOWS THE SAME

02:08:33.038 --> 02:08:34.606
PATTERN WE'VE SEEN BEFORE AFTER

02:08:34.673 --> 02:08:35.841
THE PREVIOUS ROUNDS OF IMPROVED

02:08:35.908 --> 02:08:37.242
MOBILE COVERAGE AND FIBRE

02:08:37.309 --> 02:08:39.144
BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT THAT WILL

02:08:39.211 --> 02:08:40.813
WHAT POLICY MAKERS HAVE LOST

02:08:40.879 --> 02:08:43.315
THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO USE PERMIT

02:08:43.382 --> 02:08:45.350
STREAMLINING AS AN INCENTIVE TO

02:08:45.417 --> 02:08:47.252
ENCOURAGE WORK REQUIRE.

02:08:47.319 --> 02:08:49.321
EQUITABLE DEPLOYMENT BECAUSE

02:08:49.388 --> 02:08:50.889
ONCE THE FACILITIES ARE

02:08:50.956 --> 02:08:52.091
REPORTED IN THE MOST LUCRATIVE

02:08:52.157 --> 02:08:55.260
AREAS THAT LEVERAGE WILL BE

02:08:55.327 --> 02:08:57.796
GONE SO TO SUMMARIZE FIRST THAT

02:08:57.863 --> 02:08:58.931
THE BENEFITS OF FIVE G. ARE

02:08:58.997 --> 02:09:00.732
ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE FIBER AND

02:09:00.799 --> 02:09:02.401
THE NEWLY APPROVED A STATE

02:09:02.468 --> 02:09:04.136
OWNED OPEN ACCESS MIDDLE MILE

02:09:04.203 --> 02:09:05.671
NETWORK WILL SIGNIFICANTLY

02:09:05.737 --> 02:09:07.139
INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF

02:09:07.206 --> 02:09:09.775
FIBRE DECREASE THE COST OF

02:09:09.842 --> 02:09:11.977
EXPANDING. LAST MILE NETWORKS

02:09:12.044 --> 02:09:13.345
FOR ALL PROVIDERS SO IT'S

02:09:13.412 --> 02:09:14.746
IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO

02:09:14.813 --> 02:09:17.783
FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE POLICIES

02:09:17.850 --> 02:09:20.052
IMPLEMENTED WITH THE PASSAGE SB

02:09:20.119 --> 02:09:21.920
ONE FIFTY SIX. SECOND THE

02:09:21.987 --> 02:09:22.921
DEREGULATION PERMIT

02:09:22.988 --> 02:09:24.857
STREAMLINING ALREADY AND ALL

02:09:24.923 --> 02:09:26.992
ALLOW PROVIDERS UNPRECEDENTED

02:09:27.059 --> 02:09:28.227
INEXPENSIVE ACCESS TO PUBLIC

02:09:28.293 --> 02:09:29.895
INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE URGE THE

02:09:29.962 --> 02:09:31.530
LEGISLATURE TO MONITOR-

02:09:31.597 --> 02:09:32.598
IMPORTANT WHETHER THIS

02:09:32.664 --> 02:09:34.366
DEREGULATION IN FACT LEADS TO A

02:09:34.433 --> 02:09:35.734
MORE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO

02:09:35.801 --> 02:09:37.436
BROADBAND WITH IT NEARLY

02:09:37.503 --> 02:09:39.538
LOWERS. THE COST TO DEPLOY THE

02:09:39.605 --> 02:09:41.140
IMPROVE TECHNOLOGY IN AREAS

02:09:41.206 --> 02:09:43.609
THAT ARE WELCOME. WE CERTAINLY

02:09:43.675 --> 02:09:45.410
HAVE HIGH HOPES THAT THIS NEW

02:09:45.477 --> 02:09:47.246
GENERATION OF TECHNOLOGY WILL

02:09:47.312 --> 02:09:51.183
RESULT IN A MORE CONNECTING

02:09:51.250 --> 02:09:52.050
CALIFORNIA. AND WE BELIEVE THAT

02:09:52.117 --> 02:09:53.318
THE APPROPRIATE ROLE OF

02:09:53.385 --> 02:09:55.354
GOVERNMENT IS TO BOTH PROVIDE

02:09:55.420 --> 02:09:56.188
PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE

02:09:56.255 --> 02:09:58.257
PUBLIC GOOD AND TO PROVIDE

02:09:58.323 --> 02:10:00.792
APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT TO MAKE

02:10:00.859 --> 02:10:01.360
SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS THANK

02:10:01.426 --> 02:10:04.263
YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

02:10:04.329 --> 02:10:05.898
YOUR PRESENTATION I HEALTH A

02:10:05.964 --> 02:10:08.167
FEW FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS FOR THE

02:10:08.233 --> 02:10:16.575
PANEL. IF I MAY OUR. OKAY SORRY.

02:10:16.642 --> 02:10:18.010
BEFORE WE GO TO QUESTIONS SO

02:10:18.076 --> 02:10:19.912
LET'S GO TO AUTHORED PANELISTS

02:10:19.978 --> 02:10:24.349

02:10:29.855 --> 02:10:30.789
STANDING BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR

LUNCH BUT I ALSO HAVE THE

02:10:33.625 --> 02:10:35.594
BENEFIT OF BATTING CLEANUP SO.

02:10:35.661 --> 02:10:38.063
I LIKE TO START OFF BY SAYING I

02:10:38.130 --> 02:10:39.565
AGREE WITH A LOT OF THINGS THAT

02:10:39.631 --> 02:10:41.733
THESE TEAM MEMBERS OF THE PANEL

02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:44.436
THAT CAME BEFORE ME SO. FIVE G.

02:10:44.503 --> 02:10:47.039
HAS A LOT OF PROMISE AND THERE

02:10:47.105 --> 02:10:49.141
ARE LOTS OF ELEGANT SOLUTIONS

02:10:49.208 --> 02:10:51.210
TO DIFFICULT PROBLEMS THAT

02:10:51.276 --> 02:10:53.845
PLAGUE. OUR NETWORK

02:10:53.912 --> 02:10:55.013
CONNECTIVITY OR NETWORK

02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:58.684
SECURITY AND OUR SOCIAL ACCESS

02:10:58.750 --> 02:10:59.518
TO THESE SERVICES THAT HAVE

02:10:59.585 --> 02:11:02.454
BECOME ESSENTIALLY A UTILITY

02:11:02.521 --> 02:11:04.056
WHAT I'M HERE TO DO TODAY IS

02:11:04.122 --> 02:11:05.224
TALK ABOUT SOME PRACTICAL

02:11:05.290 --> 02:11:07.025
IMPACTS- THAT ARE EXPECTING

02:11:07.092 --> 02:11:09.294
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AT THE

02:11:09.361 --> 02:11:12.464
DEPLOYMENT STAGE SO. ONE OF THE

02:11:12.531 --> 02:11:15.067
THINGS YOU HEARD- AT THE FIRST

02:11:15.133 --> 02:11:16.935
PANEL AND I THINK IT WAS DR

02:11:17.002 --> 02:11:19.538
GUPTA WHO SAID. THAT ADOPTION

02:11:19.605 --> 02:11:22.608
IS LUMPY WELL DEPLOYMENT IS

02:11:22.674 --> 02:11:24.843
LUCKY TO. AND IT'S PARTIALLY

02:11:24.910 --> 02:11:26.144
BECAUSE OF LIMITED REGULATORY

02:11:26.211 --> 02:11:29.514
WHIPLASH SO WE'VE HAD A DECADES

02:11:29.581 --> 02:11:31.416
OLD REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ISSUED

02:11:31.483 --> 02:11:32.551
BY THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT

02:11:32.618 --> 02:11:35.520
AND WE'VE HAD RECENTLY AS OF

02:11:35.587 --> 02:11:36.054
TWENTY NINETEEN A LOT OF

02:11:36.121 --> 02:11:37.756
CHANGES COMING FROM THE FCC

02:11:37.823 --> 02:11:39.258
ABOUT HOW FAST WERE SUPPOSED TO

02:11:39.324 --> 02:11:41.126
ADOPT CERTAIN REGULATIONS. HOW

02:11:41.193 --> 02:11:42.227
QUICKLY WERE SUPPOSED TO

02:11:42.294 --> 02:11:44.563
APPROVE CERTAIN PERMITS AND HOW

02:11:44.630 --> 02:11:45.931
MUCH MONEY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

02:11:45.998 --> 02:11:48.834
CAN CHARGE FOR THE SERVICES

02:11:48.900 --> 02:11:50.335
THEY PROVIDE IN THE PERMITTING

02:11:50.402 --> 02:11:53.639
PROCESS. AND THAT CREATES SOME

02:11:53.705 --> 02:11:55.907
PROBLEMS NUMBER ONE. IS A

02:11:55.974 --> 02:11:58.710
RESOURCE ALLOCATION PROBLEM.

02:11:58.777 --> 02:12:00.045
WIRELESS IT IS IMPORTANT ROBIN

02:12:00.112 --> 02:12:03.615
AND IS VERY IMPORTANT BUT THEREARE LOTS OF OTHER IMPORTANT

02:12:03.682 --> 02:12:04.650
ISSUES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

02:12:04.716 --> 02:12:07.319
FACE AND MANY PLANNING OR EVEN

02:12:07.386 --> 02:12:09.521
PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENTS IN THE

02:12:09.588 --> 02:12:11.690
STATE HAVE ONLY MAYBE ONE.

02:12:11.757 --> 02:12:18.797
MEMBER OF THEIR STAFF. AND ONE

02:12:18.864 --> 02:12:20.899
HUNDRED NETWORKING UP ON TOP OF

02:12:20.966 --> 02:12:22.901
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND OTHER

02:12:22.968 --> 02:12:23.468
TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT ARE

02:12:23.535 --> 02:12:25.037
PRETTY IMPORTANT OUR

02:12:25.103 --> 02:12:27.306
LEGISLATIVE AGENDA SO IF WE

02:12:27.372 --> 02:12:28.674
WANT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BE

02:12:28.740 --> 02:12:30.809
ABLE TO MOVE QUICKLY- THEY NEED

02:12:30.876 --> 02:12:32.844
TO BE PROPERLY STAFFED. AND

02:12:32.911 --> 02:12:34.579
THAT ALSO REQUIRES TIME BECAUSE

02:12:34.646 --> 02:12:36.281
IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:12:36.348 --> 02:12:38.150
THERE ARE HANDS AVAILABLE TO

02:12:38.216 --> 02:12:39.951
MOVE THESE APPLICATIONS THROUGH

02:12:40.018 --> 02:12:42.287
THE PROCESS WE'VE GOT TO BE

02:12:42.354 --> 02:12:44.156
READY WITH THOSE HANDS. FIND

02:12:44.222 --> 02:12:46.825
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE NECESSARY

02:12:46.892 --> 02:12:49.561
TO A CABLE ACCEPTING THESE

02:12:49.628 --> 02:12:51.263
APPLICATIONS REVIEWING THAT

02:12:51.330 --> 02:12:53.098
PROCESSING THEM MAKING A

02:12:53.165 --> 02:12:53.699
RECOMMENDATION ABOUT APPROVAL

02:12:53.765 --> 02:12:57.803
IT IT ALSO REQUIRES TIME ON THE

02:12:57.869 --> 02:12:59.071
FRONT SO THERE'S A BIT OF A

02:12:59.137 --> 02:13:00.939
WIND UP WHEN IT COMES TO

02:13:01.006 --> 02:13:02.841
CHANGING HOW WE PROCESS THESE

02:13:02.908 --> 02:13:04.910
APPLICATIONS WE WENT FROM

02:13:04.976 --> 02:13:07.512
ZONING HEAVY TYPE OF REVIEW

02:13:07.579 --> 02:13:10.716
PROCESS BEFORE TWENTY NINETY.

02:13:10.782 --> 02:13:13.385
TO A MORE ADMINISTRATIVE LESS

02:13:13.452 --> 02:13:16.221
HEARING HEAVY TYPE PROCESS

02:13:16.288 --> 02:13:18.657
AFTER TWENTY G. AND IN MANY

02:13:18.724 --> 02:13:20.325
CASES THE TIME IT TAKES TO

02:13:20.392 --> 02:13:21.526
PROCESS AN APPLICATION UNDER

02:13:21.593 --> 02:13:22.461
WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:13:22.527 --> 02:13:25.030
CALLED SHOT CLOCK CAN BE LONGER

02:13:25.097 --> 02:13:27.132
THAN THE TIME IT TAKES I'M

02:13:27.199 --> 02:13:28.633
SORRY SHORTER THAN THE TIME IT

02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:31.470
TAKES. TO ADOPT NEW REGULATIONS

02:13:31.536 --> 02:13:32.971
AND ALLOW CITIES TO PROCESS

02:13:33.038 --> 02:13:34.606
THESE APPLICATIONS ON

02:13:34.673 --> 02:13:36.875
ADMINISTRATIVE BASIS SO GIVING

02:13:36.942 --> 02:13:38.844
US TIME AND RESOURCES WOULD

02:13:38.910 --> 02:13:41.747
HELP IN ADAPTING TO THE CHANGES

02:13:41.813 --> 02:13:43.014
IN TECHNOLOGY AND REGULATION

02:13:43.081 --> 02:13:44.783
THAT WE'RE SEEING. FROM THE

02:13:44.850 --> 02:13:45.984
STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL AND

02:13:46.051 --> 02:13:48.086
FROM PRIVATE INDUSTRY AND IT'S

02:13:48.153 --> 02:13:49.955
NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING

02:13:50.021 --> 02:13:53.859
IT'S JUST UNNECESSARY INPUT TO

02:13:53.925 --> 02:13:54.659
THAT PROCESS AND I HEARD FOR

02:13:54.726 --> 02:13:56.261
EXAMPLE MISS PARKER FROM T.

02:13:56.328 --> 02:13:58.230
MOBILE TALK ABOUT THE SMART

02:13:58.296 --> 02:13:58.997
PROCESS AND I THINK THAT'S

02:13:59.064 --> 02:14:00.799
GREAT. A LOT OF OUR CLIENTS

02:14:00.866 --> 02:14:02.634
HAVE ADOPTED. PROCESS SEES

02:14:02.701 --> 02:14:04.002
WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THEIR

02:14:04.069 --> 02:14:05.170
AUTHORITY BECAUSE MUCH OF THEIR

02:14:05.237 --> 02:14:07.172
THIRTIES BEEN TAKEN AWAY BUT

02:14:07.239 --> 02:14:08.106
WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THEIR

02:14:08.173 --> 02:14:09.941
AUTHORITY. TO CREATE WHAT THEY

02:14:10.008 --> 02:14:12.244
CALL PRE APPROVALS. RIGHT IF

02:14:12.310 --> 02:14:13.378
THE CARRIER WANTS TO COME IN

02:14:13.445 --> 02:14:15.814
AND TALK TO THEM ABOUT A DESIGN

02:14:15.881 --> 02:14:17.682
THAT IS REPLICABLE. THROUGH

02:14:17.749 --> 02:14:20.786
COMMUNITY I AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

02:14:20.852 --> 02:14:22.053
THAT TAKES AWAY A LOT OF THE

02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:23.722
THOUGHT PROCESS THAT GOES INTO

02:14:23.789 --> 02:14:26.291
THE NORMAL REVIEW. THAT WE WANT

02:14:26.358 --> 02:14:28.293
TO. WORK WITH THEM SHOULD A

02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:30.495
STABBER STYLE AND THEN MOVE

02:14:30.562 --> 02:14:32.063
THAT FORWARD AS A PRE APPROVAL

02:14:32.130 --> 02:14:33.665
THAT COULD BE REPLICATED OVER

02:14:33.732 --> 02:14:34.733
AND OVER AGAIN REALLY

02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:38.136
STREAMLINING THAT PROCESS BUT

02:14:38.203 --> 02:14:39.938
THAT. STILL TAKES TIME THE

02:14:40.005 --> 02:14:41.807
OTHER THING I WANTED TO MENTION

02:14:41.873 --> 02:14:43.975
WAS THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT REALLY

02:14:44.042 --> 02:14:45.844
ELEGANT SOLUTIONS ABOUT.

02:14:45.911 --> 02:14:48.346
AVOIDING THE EXPENSE AND TIME

02:14:48.413 --> 02:14:50.215
THAT IT TAKES TO DEPLOY FIBER.

02:14:50.282 --> 02:14:52.050
IN AREAS THAT ARE HARD TO

02:14:52.117 --> 02:14:54.853
REACH. AND THAT IS A VERY

02:14:54.920 --> 02:14:57.255
DIFFICULT PROBLEM- THESE ARE

02:14:57.322 --> 02:15:00.058
PRIVATE ENTITIES. THE ANSWER TO

02:15:00.125 --> 02:15:01.493
THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AND SO IT'S

02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:02.561
NOT. GOING TO GIVE THEM A

02:15:02.627 --> 02:15:04.429
RETURN ON INVESTMENT TO SEND

02:15:04.496 --> 02:15:06.665
FIBER OR INVESTMENT DOLLARS OUT

02:15:06.731 --> 02:15:08.333
TO RURAL AREA THEY JUST WON'T

02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:09.267
DO IT AND WE'VE SEEN THAT

02:15:09.334 --> 02:15:10.235
HAPPEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN I

02:15:10.302 --> 02:15:12.270
THINK. MISTER NEAL MADE THAT

02:15:12.337 --> 02:15:14.439
POINT PRETTY WELL. UP THERE

02:15:14.506 --> 02:15:17.909
ARE. WIRELESS BACKHAUL OPTIONS

02:15:17.976 --> 02:15:20.178
THAT I THINK MAKES SENSE.

02:15:20.245 --> 02:15:21.079
WHAT'S POWER WAS STILL AN

02:15:21.146 --> 02:15:23.682
ISSUE. AND IN URBAN AREAS WHERE

02:15:23.748 --> 02:15:25.484
THERE AREDIGITAL DIVIDES.

02:15:25.550 --> 02:15:27.519
THERE ARE STILL FIBER OPTIONS

02:15:27.586 --> 02:15:30.188
THAT REQUIRE THE CARRIERS TO

02:15:30.255 --> 02:15:32.524
CUT UP THE STREETS. AND CUTTING

02:15:32.591 --> 02:15:35.327
UP THE STREETS IS ONE OF THE

02:15:35.393 --> 02:15:37.028
THINGS THAT INSTEAD IS A LOT OF

02:15:37.095 --> 02:15:40.232
HARPER- NOT JUST BECAUSE- OF

02:15:40.298 --> 02:15:41.533
SOMETHING YOU READ IN YOUR

02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:43.001
PACKET ABOUT THE MORATORIUM

02:15:43.068 --> 02:15:44.769
WATER SAYING THAT WE CANNOT.

02:15:44.836 --> 02:15:46.438
PROHIBIT THE DEPLOYMENT OF

02:15:46.505 --> 02:15:47.839
THESE TYPES OF FACILITIES THERE

02:15:47.906 --> 02:15:49.808
ARE SOME AGAIN ELEGANT

02:15:49.875 --> 02:15:51.276
SOLUTIONS LIKE MICROSTRATEGY

02:15:51.343 --> 02:15:52.410
INC THAT REDUCE THE IMPACT ON

02:15:52.477 --> 02:15:53.745
THE STREETS. BUT WHEN YOU'VE

02:15:53.812 --> 02:15:55.046
GOT A HALF DOZEN OR A DOZEN

02:15:55.113 --> 02:15:56.648
ENTITIES AT ALL ONE MICRO

02:15:56.715 --> 02:15:58.016
TRENCHING THROUGH ONE SIDE OF

02:15:58.083 --> 02:15:59.184
THE STREET. THE FACT THEY'RE

02:15:59.251 --> 02:16:01.152
DOIN TWELVE INCH CUTS OVER AND

02:16:01.219 --> 02:16:02.320
OVER AND OVER AGAIN DOESN'T

02:16:02.387 --> 02:16:03.688
REALLY MAKE SENSE WHEN YOU

02:16:03.755 --> 02:16:04.656
COULD BE DOING ONE LARGE

02:16:04.723 --> 02:16:06.658
STRETCH IT WE CAN'T FORCE THEM

02:16:06.725 --> 02:16:09.694
INTO THAT SITUATION. SOWE ARE

02:16:09.761 --> 02:16:12.931
DEALING WITH- THE EXTERNALITIES

02:16:12.998 --> 02:16:15.233
OF PHYSICAL ONE. AND IT DOESN'T

02:16:15.300 --> 02:16:16.902
JUST AND THAT WELL HOW MANY

02:16:16.968 --> 02:16:18.637
DIFFERENT CUTS READ HAPPENED

02:16:18.703 --> 02:16:20.906
STREET ENDS ALSO WITH. WHAT

02:16:20.972 --> 02:16:22.774
HAPPENS TO THE STREET IF THERE

02:16:22.841 --> 02:16:26.578
ARE IMPROPER. CONSTRUCTION

02:16:26.645 --> 02:16:28.680
METHODS SO I'M REPRESENT A LOT

02:16:28.747 --> 02:16:30.115
OF CITIES IN CALIFORNIA I'M NOT

02:16:30.181 --> 02:16:31.149
HERE SPEAKING FOR ANY ONE OF

02:16:31.216 --> 02:16:32.717
THEM BUT I CAN TELL YOU. THAT

02:16:32.784 --> 02:16:35.520
THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF LAWSUITS

02:16:35.587 --> 02:16:36.621
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:16:36.688 --> 02:16:37.889
RIGHT NOW HOW DO YOU FIND TO

02:16:37.956 --> 02:16:39.124
CLOSE. GOING OVER THE

02:16:39.190 --> 02:16:41.393
HANDLEBARS BECAUSE THEY RAN

02:16:41.459 --> 02:16:44.262
INTO A TRENCH THAT FAIL AND FOR

02:16:44.329 --> 02:16:45.697
A CITY THAT DEALS WITH THAT

02:16:45.764 --> 02:16:48.633
KIND OF ISSUE IT CAUSES THEM TO

02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:50.602
POSIT THE DEPLOYMENT STAGE

02:16:50.669 --> 02:16:51.803
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT

02:16:51.870 --> 02:16:53.505
INSURANCE AND THEN WE HAVE TO

02:16:53.572 --> 02:16:56.975
TALK ABOUT INDEMNITY FOR ISSUES

02:16:57.042 --> 02:16:59.077
ABOUT CONSTRUCTION THAT WE

02:16:59.144 --> 02:17:00.645
CAN'T SAY YES OR NO WHERE WE

02:17:00.712 --> 02:17:02.213
ARE I'M SORRY WE CAN'T SAY NO

02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:04.783
TO WE HAVE TO SAY YES TO THESE

02:17:04.849 --> 02:17:05.717
TYPES OF DEPLOYMENTS IN MANY

02:17:05.784 --> 02:17:07.686
INSTANCES. AND THEN WE HAVE TO

02:17:07.752 --> 02:17:09.187
DEAL WITH THOSE EXTERNALITIES

02:17:09.254 --> 02:17:10.455
LATER THESE ARE MULTI MILLION

02:17:10.522 --> 02:17:11.523
DOLLAR JUDGMENTS THAT WERE

02:17:11.590 --> 02:17:13.558
POTENTIALLY FACING HERE SO. I

02:17:13.625 --> 02:17:16.795
THINK STREAMLINING LOCAL

02:17:16.861 --> 02:17:18.496
GOVERNMENT PROCESS SEES IS

02:17:18.563 --> 02:17:20.265
CERTAINLY PART OF THE EQUATION.

02:17:20.332 --> 02:17:22.000
BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE HAVE

02:17:22.067 --> 02:17:23.201
TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH OUR

02:17:23.268 --> 02:17:25.036
PARTNERS AND USED THE SITE. TO

02:17:25.103 --> 02:17:26.438
COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT

02:17:26.504 --> 02:17:27.806
MAKES SENSE THAT THAT DOES

02:17:27.872 --> 02:17:29.674
REQUIRE TIME AND RESOURCES. WE

02:17:29.741 --> 02:17:31.042
ALSO HAVE TO REDUCE THOSE

02:17:31.109 --> 02:17:32.177
EXTERNALITIES THE LOCAL

02:17:32.243 --> 02:17:32.944
GOVERNMENTS MIGHT HAVE TO

02:17:33.011 --> 02:17:34.679
OTHERWISE ASSUME OR AT LEAST

02:17:34.746 --> 02:17:36.281
FACE. THE POSSIBILITY OF

02:17:36.348 --> 02:17:38.383
LIABILITY FOR WHEN IT COMES TO

02:17:38.450 --> 02:17:40.251
CUTTING UP THE STREETS FOR ALL

02:17:40.318 --> 02:17:42.220
THE POWER AND FIBER THAT'S

02:17:42.287 --> 02:17:43.955
REQUIRED TO. GET HOW LIGHT UP

02:17:44.022 --> 02:17:48.660
THESE FACILITIES UP BEYOND THAT

02:17:48.727 --> 02:17:50.061
I THINK THAT THE REST OF THE

02:17:50.128 --> 02:17:51.830
PANEL IS THAT A VERY GOOD JOB

02:17:51.896 --> 02:17:53.832
OF HIGHLIGHTING WHAT THESE

02:17:53.898 --> 02:17:56.201
THINGS ARE GOOD FOR. ALL RIGHT

02:17:56.268 --> 02:17:58.370
I'LL JUST MOMENTS BECAUSE THEY

02:17:58.436 --> 02:18:00.905
SAY THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE

02:18:00.972 --> 02:18:04.042
GENERALLY IN FAVOR OF THIS KIND

02:18:04.109 --> 02:18:05.877
OF TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION

02:18:05.944 --> 02:18:07.379
THEY SEE THE BENEFITS THAT

02:18:07.445 --> 02:18:09.180
COULD COME TO THEM DOWN THE

02:18:09.247 --> 02:18:11.082
PIPELINE WHAT WE HAVE A HARD

02:18:11.149 --> 02:18:13.852
TIME WITH IS UNDERSTANDING HOW

02:18:13.918 --> 02:18:16.755
WE CAN PARTICIPATE WITH SO MANY

02:18:16.821 --> 02:18:19.157
OF US ARE ARE- LEVERAGE WITH

02:18:19.224 --> 02:18:20.792
THE LOWER EAST OR PROPERTY

02:18:20.859 --> 02:18:22.861
RIGHTS BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM US

02:18:22.927 --> 02:18:23.628
MOSTLY BY THE FEDERAL

02:18:23.695 --> 02:18:25.664
GOVERNMENT THESE DAYS. BUT WE

02:18:25.730 --> 02:18:27.799
WOULD LIKE TO WORK MORE CLOSELY

02:18:27.866 --> 02:18:29.801
WITH OUR PARTNERS ON THE

02:18:29.868 --> 02:18:32.537
INDUSTRY SIDE TO ACCOMPLISH ALL

02:18:32.604 --> 02:18:33.538
THE GOALS HAVE BEEN TALKED HERE

02:18:33.605 --> 02:18:34.873
TODAY AND SO IF THERE'S

02:18:34.939 --> 02:18:36.675
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE AT

02:18:36.741 --> 02:18:39.678
THAT LEVEL WE CERTAINLY OPEN

02:18:39.744 --> 02:18:40.812
TO. I WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER

02:18:40.879 --> 02:18:42.947
ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY

02:18:43.014 --> 02:18:44.949
MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I DO

02:18:45.016 --> 02:18:47.085
HAVE A FEW FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS

02:18:47.152 --> 02:18:49.921
IF I MAY. OF FIRST OF ALL THIS

02:18:49.988 --> 02:18:52.657
IS THE SOMEWHAT OF A TWO PART

02:18:52.724 --> 02:18:54.693
QUESTION. ARE IS THERE

02:18:54.759 --> 02:18:57.562
SOMETHING AS- AS A SATURATION

02:18:57.629 --> 02:18:59.564
POINT WHEN IT COMES TO THE

02:18:59.631 --> 02:19:01.299
DEPLOYMENT OF FIVE G. NETWORK

02:19:01.366 --> 02:19:02.667
AND WHEN THE LEGISLATURE

02:19:02.734 --> 02:19:05.036
CONSIDERS POLICY IN FIVE G.

02:19:05.103 --> 02:19:07.639
RELATED ISSUES OKAY WE OPERATE

02:19:07.706 --> 02:19:09.374
UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE

02:19:09.441 --> 02:19:11.409
NEXT GENERATION WILL REQUIRE.

02:19:11.476 --> 02:19:14.746
MORE CELLS IN CLOSER PROXIMITY

02:19:14.813 --> 02:19:17.148
TO ONE ANOTHER WHETHER IT'S

02:19:17.215 --> 02:19:21.953
URBAN OR RULE OR OTHERWISE. I

02:19:22.020 --> 02:19:23.688
THINK I CAN TAKE A SHOT AT THAT

02:19:23.755 --> 02:19:27.459
SURE- I THINK THE- AS FAR AS IS

02:19:27.525 --> 02:19:30.595
THERE A SATURATION POINT- I

02:19:30.662 --> 02:19:32.597
DON'T KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW THAT

02:19:32.664 --> 02:19:34.899
THERE IS RIGHT. ESPECIALLY FIVE

02:19:34.966 --> 02:19:36.935
G. BEING DEPLOYED AS A NEWER

02:19:37.001 --> 02:19:40.038
TECHNOLOGY- WE HAVE A LONG WAY

02:19:40.105 --> 02:19:41.406
TO GO BEFORE THERE'S A

02:19:41.473 --> 02:19:43.375
SATURATION POINT THERE HOWEVER

02:19:43.441 --> 02:19:46.377
I DO YOU- WANT TO KIND OF POINT

02:19:46.444 --> 02:19:49.681
OUT SOME THINGS THAT ACTUALLY-

02:19:49.748 --> 02:19:51.149
ARE USEFUL WITH THE FIVE G.

02:19:51.216 --> 02:19:52.751
TECHNOLOGY WHERE WE DIDN'T

02:19:52.817 --> 02:19:54.285
NECESSARILY HAVE THE CAPABILITY

02:19:54.352 --> 02:19:57.222
WITH FOUR G. M. WE'RE ABLE TO.

02:19:57.288 --> 02:20:00.425
SLICE OF SPECTRUM AND BE ABLE

02:20:00.492 --> 02:20:02.393
TO MAKE IT WORK A FURTHER AND

02:20:02.460 --> 02:20:04.863
LONGER IN THE WRK WITH- FOR

02:20:04.929 --> 02:20:07.265
JEEP WHICH END UP HELPING US IN

02:20:07.332 --> 02:20:09.934
HOW AND WHERE WE DEPLOY FIVE G.

02:20:10.001 --> 02:20:11.770
AND- WHICH SITES WE DECIDED TO

02:20:11.836 --> 02:20:13.571
UPGRADE WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY SO

02:20:13.638 --> 02:20:15.073
I THINK IT ACTUALLY IS MORE

02:20:15.140 --> 02:20:17.041
HELPFUL THE WAY THAT WE ARE

02:20:17.108 --> 02:20:20.145
ABLE TO- PIECE OF. THE SPECTRUM

02:20:20.211 --> 02:20:21.746
THAT WE ALREADY HAVE AVAILABLE

02:20:21.813 --> 02:20:23.214
FOR USE AND MAKE IT ACTUALLY

02:20:23.281 --> 02:20:25.283
WORK FURTHER FOR US

02:20:25.350 --> 02:20:27.252
ADDITIONALLY I THINK OF WHEN I

02:20:27.318 --> 02:20:28.686
WAS HAVING THE DISCUSSION ABOUT

02:20:28.753 --> 02:20:31.189
LOW BAND MID BAND AND HIGH BAND

02:20:31.256 --> 02:20:32.924
I WANTED TO EXPLAIN THAT LOW

02:20:32.991 --> 02:20:36.528
BAND- THAT TECHNOLOGY- HELPED

02:20:36.594 --> 02:20:37.762
US A LITTLE BIT MORE WITH

02:20:37.829 --> 02:20:39.831
INDOOR AND INTEGRATION. MID

02:20:39.898 --> 02:20:42.834
BAND- IS HELPING US WITH INDOOR

02:20:42.901 --> 02:20:44.469
AND OUTDOOR PENETRATION BUT

02:20:44.536 --> 02:20:48.006
IT'S FOR. A LONGER DISTANCE AND

02:20:48.072 --> 02:20:49.674
THEM HI B. AND IS VERY SHORT

02:20:49.741 --> 02:20:52.811
DISTANCES OF THE LINE OF SIGHT

02:20:52.877 --> 02:20:54.212
TO THE NEXT SITE HAS TO BE

02:20:54.279 --> 02:20:55.213
PRETTY CLEAR WITH NO

02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:58.383
OBSTRUCTION THERE SO- PART OF

02:20:58.449 --> 02:21:00.685
THAT LAYERED APPROACH THAT I.

02:21:00.752 --> 02:21:02.086
TALKED ABOUT THAT MOST CARRIERS

02:21:02.153 --> 02:21:04.055
ARE ARE SEARCHING FOR AS A

02:21:04.122 --> 02:21:05.623
STRATEGY IS TO HELP TO KIND OF

02:21:05.690 --> 02:21:08.026
BRIDGE THE GAPS BETWEEN THOSE

02:21:08.092 --> 02:21:09.627
THREE OBJECTIVES FOR OUR

02:21:09.694 --> 02:21:16.768
CUSTOMERS AND SO THERE BY. IT

02:21:16.835 --> 02:21:18.269
WILL IT. MAY NOT RESULT IN

02:21:18.336 --> 02:21:19.604
HAVING HAVE A SAY EVERY I THINK

02:21:19.671 --> 02:21:20.205
A LOT OF THE IS THAT WE GOING

02:21:20.271 --> 02:21:20.772
TO HAVE TO HAVE A SITE AND

02:21:20.839 --> 02:21:23.641
OTHER RIGHT AND BY AGAIN THAT

02:21:23.708 --> 02:21:25.910
TECHNOLOGY GIVES US THE ABILITY

02:21:25.977 --> 02:21:27.245
TO LOOK AT OF THE

02:21:27.312 --> 02:21:29.781
INFRASTRUCTURE WE ARE WE DO

02:21:29.848 --> 02:21:33.218
NEED TO ADDRESS- WHERE IS INTO

02:21:33.284 --> 02:21:34.853
IT AND IT'S NOT THE SAME

02:21:34.919 --> 02:21:36.721
EVERYWHERE RIGHT BASED ON WHAT

02:21:36.788 --> 02:21:37.789
WE ALREADY HAPPENED OUR

02:21:37.856 --> 02:21:41.125
EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. I HOPE

02:21:41.192 --> 02:21:42.760
THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION GREAT

02:21:42.827 --> 02:21:44.829
THANK YOU OTHER PANELS SO IF

02:21:44.896 --> 02:21:51.636
WE'RE CHINA FOR LIKE. WELL I'LL

02:21:51.703 --> 02:21:52.971
JUST I'LL JUST ADD THAT PERHAPS

02:21:53.037 --> 02:21:55.139
SOMEBODY WITH THE HONORIFIC DR

02:21:55.206 --> 02:21:56.941
IN FRONT OF THE NEXT PROBABLY

02:21:57.008 --> 02:21:58.142
IF YOU'RE BETTER THAN I CAN

02:21:58.209 --> 02:22:00.411
THERE'S A LIMITED CAPACITY OF

02:22:00.478 --> 02:22:02.847
SPECTRUM- THAT IT IS ABLE TO

02:22:02.914 --> 02:22:05.116
TRANSPORT DATA. AND I THINK ONE

02:22:05.183 --> 02:22:06.618
OF THE THINGS MISS PARKER WAS

02:22:06.684 --> 02:22:08.720
TRYING TO HARP ON IS THAT YOU

02:22:08.786 --> 02:22:11.656
CAN HAVE SOFTWARE- BEHIND THE

02:22:11.723 --> 02:22:13.591
PHYSICAL HARDWARE THAT CREATES

02:22:13.658 --> 02:22:14.993
EXCESS CAPACITY DOESN'T

02:22:15.059 --> 02:22:16.261
NECESSARILY PART OF THE SAME

02:22:16.327 --> 02:22:18.529
KINDS. OF SOLUTION AND SO FOR

02:22:18.596 --> 02:22:20.465
EXAMPLE JUST TO USE YOU MISS

02:22:20.531 --> 02:22:22.400
PARKER IS THE EXACT T. MOBILE

02:22:22.467 --> 02:22:25.870
USES. STRAND MOUNTED ANTENNAS

02:22:25.937 --> 02:22:28.539
TO OFF LOAD CAPACITY ON TWO OF

02:22:28.606 --> 02:22:30.541
A FROM THEIR NETWORKS FOR SMALL

02:22:30.608 --> 02:22:32.377
CELLS INSTEAD OF MASSIVE

02:22:32.443 --> 02:22:34.245
DEPLOYMENTS OF. THINGS ON PAUSE

02:22:34.312 --> 02:22:36.114
YOU STILL DO THINGS ON POLLS

02:22:36.180 --> 02:22:38.383
TOO BUT I IT'S THERE ARE LOTS

02:22:38.449 --> 02:22:39.617
OF DIFFERENT TOOLS IN THE BOX

02:22:39.684 --> 02:22:40.818
AND SO IN TERMS OF THE

02:22:40.885 --> 02:22:42.120
SATURATION POINT IT MAY NOT BE

02:22:42.186 --> 02:22:43.721
A POLE IN FRONT OF EVERY TIME

02:22:43.788 --> 02:22:47.358
WAY- BUT IT CERTAINLY- IS

02:22:47.425 --> 02:22:48.893
DEPENDENT UPON THE ABILITY OF

02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:50.461
THE INDUSTRY TO. DETERMINE NEW

02:22:50.528 --> 02:22:52.163
SOLUTIONS FOR GETTING HIGH

02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:54.098
CAPACITY THROUGH THEIR PIPES I

02:22:54.165 --> 02:22:55.733
THINK FIBER IS PROBABLY GOING

02:22:55.800 --> 02:22:56.701
TO BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST

02:22:56.768 --> 02:22:58.269
ANSWERS TO THAT BECAUSE THE

02:22:58.336 --> 02:23:00.405
MATTER WHERE YOU GO. THAT DATA

02:23:00.471 --> 02:23:02.740
HAS TO FLOW BACK TO THE REST OF

02:23:02.807 --> 02:23:03.675
THE NETWORK AT SOME POINT AND

02:23:03.741 --> 02:23:05.643
SO FIVE OR TO THE POINT. OF

02:23:05.710 --> 02:23:08.913
CONNECTION. IS PROBABLY GOING

02:23:08.980 --> 02:23:09.647
TO BE RESOLUTION GREAT THANK

02:23:09.714 --> 02:23:16.587
YOU. I THINK I HEARD THE TERM

02:23:16.654 --> 02:23:17.588
FOUR GB MENTION A COUPLE TIMES-

02:23:17.655 --> 02:23:19.590
BY VARIOUS PANEL AS THE

02:23:19.657 --> 02:23:20.825
QUESTION IS ARE THERE ANY

02:23:20.892 --> 02:23:22.827
ASPECTS OF THE PHYSICAL

02:23:22.894 --> 02:23:24.495
INFRASTRUCTURE OF FIVE G.

02:23:24.562 --> 02:23:26.130
NETWORKS THAT THE NEXT

02:23:26.197 --> 02:23:27.966
GENERATION OF MOBILE NETWORKS

02:23:28.032 --> 02:23:31.869
WILL CERTAINLY- RENDER OBSOLETE

02:23:31.936 --> 02:23:36.641
RENDER THIS ONE OBSOLETE. ANY

02:23:36.708 --> 02:23:40.678
TAKERS BUT I QUESTION. I MEAN I

02:23:40.745 --> 02:23:42.080
I'M GONNA TAKE A STAB AT IT I

02:23:42.146 --> 02:23:44.482
DON'T KNOW WEEK SINCE I DON'T

02:23:44.549 --> 02:23:45.984
KNOW WHAT SIX GENERATION NEXT

02:23:46.050 --> 02:23:48.219
LOOKS LIKE YET I DON'T KNOW

02:23:48.286 --> 02:23:49.921
WHAT COULD BE RENDERED OBSOLETE

02:23:49.988 --> 02:23:51.789
IN THE FUTURE HOWEVER WHAT I

02:23:51.856 --> 02:23:54.292
CAN SAY WHAT WE KNOW FOR SURE.

02:23:54.359 --> 02:23:55.893
IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

02:23:55.960 --> 02:23:58.229
PLAYERS IN OUR- INFRASTRUCTURE

02:23:58.296 --> 02:23:59.864
THAT HAVE EXISTED FOR MANY

02:23:59.931 --> 02:24:02.233
YEARS INCLUDING- YOU YES WHICH

02:24:02.300 --> 02:24:05.003
WAS THIRD GENERATION. INSTEAD

02:24:05.069 --> 02:24:08.506
OF YOUR YOUR STOCK YES SO IT'S

02:24:08.573 --> 02:24:09.273
FAR THAT'S GETTING TO THE

02:24:09.340 --> 02:24:11.075
OBSOLETE POINT I DO THINK IT

02:24:11.142 --> 02:24:13.511
TAKES TIME AS AS THE TECHNOLOGY

02:24:13.578 --> 02:24:15.947
EVOLVES TO DETERMINE WHEN WE

02:24:16.014 --> 02:24:18.316
WILL GET TO THAT. POINT I DON'T

02:24:18.383 --> 02:24:20.618
KNOW THAT FOUR G. WILL WOULD BE

02:24:20.685 --> 02:24:22.587
OBSOLETE ANYTIME IN THE IN THE

02:24:22.653 --> 02:24:24.622
NEAR FUTURE BUT WE DO HAVE TO

02:24:24.689 --> 02:24:26.791
LOOK AT ALL OF THAT. AS

02:24:26.858 --> 02:24:28.292
CUSTOMERS THAT WE HAVE IN ALL

02:24:28.359 --> 02:24:29.794
OF THE DEVICES THAT ARE

02:24:29.861 --> 02:24:31.562
AVAILABLE TO THE CUSTOMERS AND

02:24:31.629 --> 02:24:32.797
WHEN WE'RE PLANNING OUR NETWORK

02:24:32.864 --> 02:24:35.633
WE DO CONSIDER THAT IN. OF WHAT

02:24:35.700 --> 02:24:37.668
TECHNOLOGY NEEDS TO BE ON EACH

02:24:37.735 --> 02:24:39.737
INDIVIDUAL SITE SO IF YOU HAVE

02:24:39.804 --> 02:24:41.506
A FOUR G. DEVICE CAPABLE DEVICE

02:24:41.572 --> 02:24:43.074
AND YOU'RE NOT YET MOVED ONTO

02:24:43.141 --> 02:24:45.076
THE FIVE G. CAPABLE DEVICE WE

02:24:45.143 --> 02:24:46.711
OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO STILL SERVE

02:24:46.778 --> 02:24:48.946
THE CUSTOMER. THAT WE HAVE- I

02:24:49.013 --> 02:24:49.814
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE

02:24:49.881 --> 02:24:53.151
HOLDS- I WOULD IMAGINE THAT- AS

02:24:53.217 --> 02:24:54.786
WE KEEP MOVING TECHNOLOGY

02:24:54.852 --> 02:24:56.654
FORWARD- AND WE GET A CHANCE

02:24:56.721 --> 02:24:59.223
TECHNOLOGY THERE WILL BE. SOME

02:24:59.290 --> 02:25:00.691
OF THE TECHNOLOGY FOR THE PAST

02:25:00.758 --> 02:25:02.994
WILL BE RENDERED USELESS BUT I

02:25:03.061 --> 02:25:04.262
HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET LEAD TO

02:25:04.328 --> 02:25:06.864
THAT POINT AND I WORK FOR MORE

02:25:06.931 --> 02:25:08.199
THAN EIGHTY IT SB THAT T.

02:25:08.266 --> 02:25:10.301
MOBILE WORKED FOR. EIGHTEEN T.

02:25:10.368 --> 02:25:12.136
IN THE PAST SO I'VE SEEN A

02:25:12.203 --> 02:25:13.671
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT NETWORKS

02:25:13.738 --> 02:25:14.972
AND KIND OF HOW THE- THE

02:25:15.039 --> 02:25:16.274
INFRASTRUCTURE WORKS AND I

02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:18.009
THINK. WE'RE NOT AT THAT POINT

02:25:18.076 --> 02:25:23.247
YET BUT HE COULD BE THERE IN.

02:25:23.314 --> 02:25:24.882
IN THE FUTURE SHOULD BE SOME

02:25:24.949 --> 02:25:26.484
OTHER TECH THAT IT BOB THAT

02:25:26.551 --> 02:25:29.153
HOUSES CAN GET RID YEAH ANOTHER

02:25:29.220 --> 02:25:31.522
AND OTHER WE CURRENTLY HAVE

02:25:31.589 --> 02:25:36.894
THANK I'LL JUST ADD THE CLIENT

02:25:36.961 --> 02:25:38.129
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING ME WHEN

02:25:38.196 --> 02:25:39.497
SATELLITES ARE GONNA REPLACE

02:25:39.564 --> 02:25:41.933
TERRESTRIAL SYSTEMS FOR LIKE

02:25:41.999 --> 02:25:43.868
THE LAST FIVE SIX SEVEN. AND

02:25:43.935 --> 02:25:45.636
THE ANSWER IS I DON'T KNOW BUT

02:25:45.703 --> 02:25:46.471
I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA BE

02:25:46.537 --> 02:25:48.539
ANYTIME SOON MOSTLY BECAUSE AS

02:25:48.606 --> 02:25:50.875
MISS PARKER SAID. PEOPLE ARE

02:25:50.942 --> 02:25:51.676
STILL USED AND DEVICES ARE

02:25:51.742 --> 02:25:54.512
STILL USE OLDER TECHNOLOGIES

02:25:54.579 --> 02:25:55.780
AND SO LONG AS THOSE ARE PART

02:25:55.847 --> 02:25:57.315
OF THE ECOSYSTEM MANY ECONOMY

02:25:57.381 --> 02:25:59.083
THEY'LL STILL BE SUPPORTED

02:25:59.150 --> 02:26:00.318
WHICH REQUIRES SUCH RATIONAL

02:26:00.384 --> 02:26:02.487
SYSTEM. SO I DON'T THINK IT'S

02:26:02.553 --> 02:26:03.588
GOING TO BE ANY TIME SOON WE'RE

02:26:03.654 --> 02:26:05.089
GOING TO SEE A LOSS OF PHYSICAL

02:26:05.156 --> 02:26:07.925
INFRASTRUCTURE IN. EITHER IN OR

02:26:07.992 --> 02:26:10.495
OUTSIDE RIGHT THANK YOU EARLIER

02:26:10.561 --> 02:26:11.662
HURT WE HURT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

02:26:11.729 --> 02:26:13.998
THE FCC REGULATIONS IN SOME OF

02:26:14.065 --> 02:26:16.434
THE CHALLENGES THAT- A WE HAVE

02:26:16.501 --> 02:26:19.137
WITH THE DEPLOYMENT OF FIVE G.

02:26:19.203 --> 02:26:20.771
OF THE MEAT POSED THIS QUESTION

02:26:20.838 --> 02:26:22.974
I'M WONDERING WHETHER. COUNTIES

02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:24.909
AND FAX CITIES FOR THAT MATTER.

02:26:24.976 --> 02:26:26.444
AW HOW CURRENTLY HAVE THE

02:26:26.511 --> 02:26:28.012
LATITUDE TO STUDY THE SAFETY

02:26:28.079 --> 02:26:30.148
AND HEALTH ISSUES. ALL WITH

02:26:30.214 --> 02:26:31.282
RESPECT TO THE DEPLOYMENT OF

02:26:31.349 --> 02:26:32.783
CELL TECHNOLOGY I THINK-

02:26:32.850 --> 02:26:34.986
PROBABLY. A QUESTION SHE GO TO

02:26:35.052 --> 02:26:37.822
MISTER NEAL AND WARM- STRIP

02:26:37.889 --> 02:26:40.558
MAYES FOR ANYONE OF THE

02:26:40.625 --> 02:26:45.263
PANELISTS IN FACT I'M HAPPY TO.

02:26:45.329 --> 02:26:47.431
TAKE A START AT EIGHT AM I

02:26:47.498 --> 02:26:50.801
DON'T KNOW THAT THE ROLE OF

02:26:50.868 --> 02:26:53.337
COUNTY'S NECESSARILY IS TO

02:26:53.404 --> 02:26:55.773
EXAMINE SPECIFICALLY THE HEALTH

02:26:55.840 --> 02:26:57.708
EFFECTS ON ON INDIVIDUALS I

02:26:57.775 --> 02:27:00.545
THINK. A LOT OF THE TAXES THAT

02:27:00.611 --> 02:27:02.280
WE TALK ABOUT THAT WE WORRY

02:27:02.346 --> 02:27:03.614
ABOUT WITH DEPLOYMENT

02:27:03.681 --> 02:27:07.318
pOF WAY ARE THE PUBLIC SAFETY

02:27:07.385 --> 02:27:09.720
ASPECTS OF- YOU KNOW TRAFFIC

02:27:09.787 --> 02:27:13.591
CONTROL PLANS- YOU KNOW BAN-

02:27:13.658 --> 02:27:16.093
WHEN WERE ABLE TO. YOU KNOW

02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:18.296
MAKE SURE THAT ARE OF A POLL IS

02:27:18.362 --> 02:27:20.932
EVIL PHYSICALLY ABLE TO TAKE

02:27:20.998 --> 02:27:23.301
THE WEIGHT OF A SMALL SALARY

02:27:23.367 --> 02:27:25.002
YOU KNOW IN THE NUMBER OF

02:27:25.069 --> 02:27:25.970
ATTACHMENTS WE DON'T KNOW HOW

02:27:26.037 --> 02:27:28.239
MANY- YOU KNOW COMPANIES WILL

02:27:28.306 --> 02:27:29.974
WANT TO DEPLOY IN PARTICULAR

02:27:30.041 --> 02:27:31.242
AREAS THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY

02:27:31.309 --> 02:27:32.777
HOLES WHAT ONE COMPANY MIGHT

02:27:32.843 --> 02:27:33.911
NOT HAVE TO DEPLOY ON EVERY

02:27:33.978 --> 02:27:38.249
OTHER POLL. AND IF YOU HAVE A

02:27:38.316 --> 02:27:38.849
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CARRIERS

02:27:38.916 --> 02:27:41.452
ALL ONE TO PROVIDE AT YOU KNOW

02:27:41.519 --> 02:27:42.787
MISTER IN THE SAME AREA AT SOME

02:27:42.853 --> 02:27:46.057
YOU NEED MORE LANES AS MR REYES

02:27:46.123 --> 02:27:47.558
WAS SAYING EARLIER AND SO SOME

02:27:47.625 --> 02:27:49.560
OF THE PUBLIC AND THAT'S ROBERT

02:27:49.627 --> 02:27:51.362
WAS SAYING SOME OF THE PUBLIC

02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:53.464
SAFETY ASPECTS LIKE THAT.

02:27:53.531 --> 02:27:55.433
BICYCLISTS RUNNING INTO TO

02:27:55.499 --> 02:27:57.468
TRENCHES YOU KNOW IT WHAT'S OUR

02:27:57.535 --> 02:27:59.637
ABILITY TO. REGULATE THE

02:27:59.704 --> 02:28:01.205
DEPLOYMENT AND THAT WAY THANK

02:28:01.272 --> 02:28:04.542
ARE A LOT OF THE CONCERNS THAT.

02:28:04.609 --> 02:28:08.546
WE YEAH I THINK THAT'S RIGHT I

02:28:08.613 --> 02:28:10.281
ON THE CITY SIDE OF THE DAY

02:28:10.348 --> 02:28:12.383
TODAY CONCERNED IS. OR IS IT A

02:28:12.450 --> 02:28:14.785
POINT SIX. IS A CONSTRUCTION

02:28:14.852 --> 02:28:16.887
SAVE IS THE ACTIVITY GOING TO

02:28:16.954 --> 02:28:18.756
DISRUPT THE OTHER USES OF THE

02:28:18.823 --> 02:28:19.323
RIGHT OF WAY THAT KIND OF

02:28:19.390 --> 02:28:22.627
THING- BUT YOUR QUESTION WAS

02:28:22.693 --> 02:28:24.829
MORE GENERALLY DIRECTED TOWARDS

02:28:24.895 --> 02:28:25.997
THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF

02:28:26.063 --> 02:28:28.165
RADIOFREQUENCY EMISSIONS. AND

02:28:28.232 --> 02:28:30.268
SO NDER THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS

02:28:30.334 --> 02:28:31.202
ACT THE LAST TWENTY SOME ODD

02:28:31.269 --> 02:28:32.803
YEARS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE

02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:35.072
NOT BEEN ABLE TO TAKE THAT INTO

02:28:35.139 --> 02:28:37.675
ACCOUNT. WHEN DETERMINING

02:28:37.742 --> 02:28:39.543
WHETHER TO APPROVE OR DENY AN

02:28:39.610 --> 02:28:42.913
APPLICATION FOR AN ANTENNA A

02:28:42.980 --> 02:28:45.616
LITTLE LESS THE ANTENNA IS

02:28:45.683 --> 02:28:46.984
DEMONSTRATED SHOULD NOT BE IN

02:28:47.051 --> 02:28:48.619
COMPLIANCE WITH STANDARDS SET

02:28:48.686 --> 02:28:51.756
BY THE FCC SO THIS DOESN'T MEAN

02:28:51.822 --> 02:28:52.790
NECESSARILY THAT LOCAL

02:28:52.857 --> 02:28:53.758
GOVERNMENTS CAN'T CONSIDER THIS

02:28:53.824 --> 02:28:55.760
ISSUE BUT IT'S A SEPARATE ONE

02:28:55.826 --> 02:28:57.928
FROM THE PHYSICAL DEPLOYMENT OF

02:28:57.995 --> 02:29:00.331
PARTICULAR SITE ESPECIALLY WHEN

02:29:00.398 --> 02:29:01.265
WE'RE ONLY GIVEN MAYBE SIXTY

02:29:01.332 --> 02:29:03.467
DAYS TO RUBIO APPLICATION WE

02:29:03.534 --> 02:29:05.269
DON'T NEED OR NECESSARILY HAVE

02:29:05.336 --> 02:29:07.838
THE TIME. TO GO THROUGH A FULL

02:29:07.905 --> 02:29:09.140
REVIEW OF ALL THE SCIENTIFIC

02:29:09.206 --> 02:29:11.876
EVIDENCE WE ARE LEGALLY

02:29:11.942 --> 02:29:14.312
RESTRICTED TO JUST WHETHER THE

02:29:14.378 --> 02:29:16.547
APPLICATION WOULD COMPLY WITH

02:29:16.614 --> 02:29:18.516
THE FTC'S LIMITS ARE NOT.

02:29:18.582 --> 02:29:21.085
CITIES CAN AND DO TAKE ISSUE

02:29:21.152 --> 02:29:23.421
WITH THIS AND ONE EXAMPLE WOULD

02:29:23.487 --> 02:29:25.189
BE THE RECENT CASE OF THE DC

02:29:25.256 --> 02:29:26.090
CIRCUIT ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH

02:29:26.157 --> 02:29:30.194
TRUST USES FCC WHERE THE

02:29:30.261 --> 02:29:32.129
PETITIONERS WERE ABLE TO HAVE

02:29:32.196 --> 02:29:34.565
THE DC CIRCUIT STRUCK DOWN THE

02:29:34.632 --> 02:29:37.068
FCC'S CLOSING OF A NOTICE OF

02:29:37.134 --> 02:29:39.170
INQUIRY INTO CHANGES TO THE TO

02:29:39.236 --> 02:29:41.539
THE ERROR FEDERAL LIMITS SO IT

02:29:41.605 --> 02:29:43.274
IS NOT A CLOSE QUESTION BY ANY

02:29:43.341 --> 02:29:45.576
MEANS BUT ON INDIVIDUAL SIDE BY

02:29:45.643 --> 02:29:47.211
SIDE SPACES IT IS A MUCH

02:29:47.278 --> 02:29:48.713
NARROWER IN KOREA JUST

02:29:48.779 --> 02:29:53.084
COMPLIANCE. WITH THE SEC'S.

02:29:53.150 --> 02:29:55.820
STANDARDS THANK YOU OUR NEXT

02:29:55.886 --> 02:29:57.822
QUESTION IS THERE ANY POTENTIAL

02:29:57.888 --> 02:29:59.724
FOR INVESTMENTS IN STREAMLINING

02:29:59.790 --> 02:30:02.626
EDUCATION TOWARDS JOBS. THAT

02:30:02.693 --> 02:30:03.728
INVOLVE THE DEPLOYMENT

02:30:03.794 --> 02:30:05.429
MAINTENANCE AND USING A FIVE G.

02:30:05.496 --> 02:30:14.271
TECHNOLOGIES. WELL I'LL I'LL

02:30:14.338 --> 02:30:15.840
TAKE THIS ONE JUST TO START OFF

02:30:15.906 --> 02:30:17.975
BUT BECAUSE I THINK I MENTIONED

02:30:18.042 --> 02:30:21.445
SOMETHING ABOUT IT EARLIER- ONE

02:30:21.512 --> 02:30:22.646
OF THE THINGS THAT CAME OUT OF

02:30:22.713 --> 02:30:23.881
THE FCC'S MOST RECENT

02:30:23.948 --> 02:30:26.117
RULEMAKINGS ON SMALL WIRELESS

02:30:26.183 --> 02:30:28.052
FACILITIES. WELL AS THE

02:30:28.119 --> 02:30:29.720
OBLITERATION OF THE DISTINCTION

02:30:29.787 --> 02:30:31.222
OF MUNICIPAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

02:30:31.288 --> 02:30:31.989
VERSUS THE REGULATORY

02:30:32.056 --> 02:30:34.725
AUTHORITY. AND THAT DISTINCTION

02:30:34.792 --> 02:30:36.694
WAS ONE OF THE BASIS ON WHICH

02:30:36.761 --> 02:30:37.528
WE WERE ABLE TO CREATE

02:30:37.595 --> 02:30:39.063
PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY AT

02:30:39.130 --> 02:30:43.601
LOCAL- SO FOR EXAMPLE A. J.

02:30:43.667 --> 02:30:48.105
EXPEDITED- LEASING PROCESS USE

02:30:48.172 --> 02:30:50.040
OR REDUCE LEASING FEES AND

02:30:50.107 --> 02:30:51.442
EXCHANGE FOR IN KIND

02:30:51.509 --> 02:30:54.912
CONSIDERATION BY FOR EXAMPLE.

02:30:54.979 --> 02:30:56.847
GRANTS TO SMALL BUSINESSES

02:30:56.914 --> 02:30:59.917
DEVICE IS A SMALL BUSINESSES

02:30:59.984 --> 02:31:04.088
NATURE. BECAUSE ALL OF AT

02:31:04.155 --> 02:31:05.756
PROPRIETARY AUTHORITY HAS BEEN

02:31:05.823 --> 02:31:08.292
GRANTED WE'VE SEEN A KIND OF.

02:31:08.359 --> 02:31:12.163
BOTTOM FALL OUT OF THOSE TYPES

02:31:12.229 --> 02:31:13.564
OF ARRANGEMENTS BEING HI THERE

02:31:13.631 --> 02:31:15.833
ARE OTHER WAYS OF TRYING TO

02:31:15.900 --> 02:31:17.234
PARTNER WITH THE INDUSTRY BUT

02:31:17.301 --> 02:31:18.335
THEY'RE JUST BECOMING SMALLER

02:31:18.402 --> 02:31:19.236
AND SMALLER FROM THE

02:31:19.303 --> 02:31:21.338
PERSPECTIVE GOVERNMENTS SO WE'D

02:31:21.405 --> 02:31:22.740
CERTAINLY BE INTERESTED IN

02:31:22.807 --> 02:31:23.974
HEARING CLEAN INDUSTRY ABOUT

02:31:24.041 --> 02:31:25.109
WHERE THEY THINK THE

02:31:25.176 --> 02:31:32.349
OPPORTUNITIES WOULD BE. I GUESS

02:31:32.416 --> 02:31:34.618
THAT WAS BROUGHT BACK MY WAY I

02:31:34.685 --> 02:31:35.853
DO THINK THAT THERE ARE

02:31:35.920 --> 02:31:37.288
OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTNER AND I

02:31:37.354 --> 02:31:38.989
THINK THAT- I ONLY CAN SPEAK ON

02:31:39.056 --> 02:31:40.825
BEHALF OF T. MOBILE BUT I DO

02:31:40.891 --> 02:31:43.561
THINK THAT INDEPENDENT OF

02:31:43.627 --> 02:31:45.563
WHETHER OR NOT A JURISDICTION

02:31:45.629 --> 02:31:47.832
SPECIFICALLY IT'S ASKING FOR US

02:31:47.898 --> 02:31:50.134
TO PARTNER THERE ARE WAYS AND

02:31:50.201 --> 02:31:50.801
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN

02:31:50.868 --> 02:31:52.970
CREATED THAT ALLOW FOR THAT TO

02:31:53.037 --> 02:31:56.474
HAPPEN ANYWAY- FOR INSTANCE- T.

02:31:56.540 --> 02:31:57.575
MOBILE HAS A PROGRAM CALLED

02:31:57.641 --> 02:31:59.343
PROJECT CAN BILLION RIGHT WHERE

02:31:59.410 --> 02:32:02.446
IT DOES- PARTNER WITH A LOCAL.

02:32:02.513 --> 02:32:04.482
MUNICIPALITIES AND ALSO SCHOOLS

02:32:04.548 --> 02:32:07.218
TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO AT YOU

02:32:07.284 --> 02:32:09.186
KNOW AT UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES

02:32:09.253 --> 02:32:10.688
IN UNDERPRIVILEGED COMMUNITIES

02:32:10.754 --> 02:32:12.223
SO I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE

02:32:12.289 --> 02:32:14.291
OPPORTUNITIES IN CREATIVE WAYS

02:32:14.358 --> 02:32:16.594
THAT ARE STILL THAT STILL EXIST

02:32:16.660 --> 02:32:18.696
RIGHT THAT CAN BE DISCUSSED AND

02:32:18.762 --> 02:32:24.101
I THINK THE KEY- I. CALL YOU

02:32:24.168 --> 02:32:24.668
TRIPS SO I'M GONNA CLEAN THE

02:32:24.735 --> 02:32:26.737
KEY IS TO HAVE THOSE AND MAKE

02:32:26.804 --> 02:32:28.072
SURE THAT THE WIRELESS

02:32:28.138 --> 02:32:30.174
INDUSTRY- INCLUDED IN SOME OF

02:32:30.241 --> 02:32:32.209
THE CONCERNS ALONG THE WAY- AS

02:32:32.276 --> 02:32:34.111
I MENTIONED EARLIER ON IN SOME

02:32:34.178 --> 02:32:35.412
OF MY COMMENTS I THINK THAT

02:32:35.479 --> 02:32:37.481
THAT. IS THE BEST WAY FOR US

02:32:37.548 --> 02:32:39.717
TO. GET TO A POINT WHERE ALL OF

02:32:39.783 --> 02:32:41.585
THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT MIGHT BE

02:32:41.652 --> 02:32:43.854
WITHIN THE COMPANY ARE-

02:32:43.921 --> 02:32:46.190
EXPLAINED AND PRODUCED AND SO

02:32:46.257 --> 02:32:47.591
THAT WE CAN COME TO

02:32:47.658 --> 02:32:48.893
PARTNERSHIPS ANYWAY BECAUSE I

02:32:48.959 --> 02:32:50.494
DO THINK THAT SOME COMPANIES

02:32:50.561 --> 02:32:51.662
ARE DOING THAT INDEPENDENTLY

02:32:51.729 --> 02:32:52.963
ANYWAY FOR THE GREATER GOOD OF

02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:54.565
THE COMMUNITY. SO THERE THEY

02:32:54.632 --> 02:32:56.467
ARE AVAILABLE THEY MAY NOT JUST

02:32:56.534 --> 02:32:59.003
BE- SOMETHING THAT WE MAY BRING

02:32:59.069 --> 02:33:00.938
TO THE TABLE AND USUALLY WHEN

02:33:01.005 --> 02:33:02.740
BURGEONING APPLICATIONS ARE

02:33:02.806 --> 02:33:04.775
ASKING TO BE PLACED ON A- YOU

02:33:04.842 --> 02:33:06.544
KNOW WOOSTER STREET WRITER POLL

02:33:06.610 --> 02:33:07.711
BUT THEY'RE DEFINITELY THERE

02:33:07.778 --> 02:33:08.979
AND I KNOW FOR T. MOBILE WE

02:33:09.046 --> 02:33:11.282
HAVE SEPARATE PROGRAMS- I

02:33:11.348 --> 02:33:12.883
RECENTLY WENT. OUT ABBACY

02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:15.185
INDIGO WE HAD- A LOT OF

02:33:15.252 --> 02:33:16.620
PROGRAMS THAT DEALT WITH THE

02:33:16.687 --> 02:33:18.055
MILITARY WHICH WAS SOMETHING

02:33:18.122 --> 02:33:19.890
THAT WAS OF INTEREST TO. THE

02:33:19.957 --> 02:33:21.425
CITIES HERE AND SO THEY WOULD

02:33:21.492 --> 02:33:22.760
ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT AND IT

02:33:22.826 --> 02:33:24.228
WOULD OPEN UP THE DIALOGUE SO

02:33:24.295 --> 02:33:26.330
THAT WE CAN SAY OF. ALL OF THE

02:33:26.397 --> 02:33:28.299
THINGS THAT WERE AVAILABLE THAT

02:33:28.365 --> 02:33:29.867
COULD BE DISCUSSED A NUMBER ON

02:33:29.934 --> 02:33:31.702
THE TABLE- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:33:31.769 --> 02:33:33.203
ARE PARTNERING. BECAUSE THE

02:33:33.270 --> 02:33:35.172
COMMUNITIES THAT THAT MAY NEVER

02:33:35.239 --> 02:33:37.007
MISS A MINUTE VALUE SERVER ALSO

02:33:37.074 --> 02:33:38.342
THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE OUR

02:33:38.409 --> 02:33:40.044
CUSTOMERS RIGHT SO WE NEED TO

02:33:40.110 --> 02:33:41.879
REALIZE THAT. IT'S A VALUE TO

02:33:41.946 --> 02:33:43.948
IT. SO I THINK ALL CARRIERS

02:33:44.014 --> 02:33:50.854
WOULD SAY THE SAME THING. THAT

02:33:50.921 --> 02:33:52.656
THEY HAVE THOSE- SHIFTING

02:33:52.723 --> 02:33:54.792

GETTING THIS NETWORK BUILT- IT

02:34:15.646 --> 02:34:17.781
DOESN'T JUST REQUIRE A CHANGE

02:34:17.848 --> 02:34:19.216
OF LAWS AND LOCAL REFORM IT

02:34:19.283 --> 02:34:21.018
