AND WILL BEGIN. THE UNITED STATES REMAINS ONE OF THE ONLY DEVELOPED COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD THAT DOES NOT PROVIDE FREE CARE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN AMONG ITS OTHER AFFECTS THE PANDEMIC IT SHINED A BRIGHT LIGHT ON HOW A LACK OF CHILD CARE INFRASTRUCTURE FURTHER DEVASTATES FAMILIES AND EXACERBATES THE STRESSORS FACING PARENTS ESPECIALLY MOTHERS ESPECIALLY WORKING MOTHERS AS CALIFORNIA AND THE REST OF THE NATION CONTINUE TO GRAPPLE WITH THE CHALLENGES OF THE CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC CHILD CARE HAS BEEN AMONG THE HARDEST HIT IN LEE SUPPORTED OF ALL SECTORS WITHIN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. WELL BEFORE THE ONSET OF THE CURRENT CRISIS CALIFORNIA'S PARENTS HAVE LONG STRUGGLE TO FIND IN FOR CHILD CARE THAT MEETS THEIR NEEDS AND CHILD CARE BUSINESSES HAVE EQUALLY STRUGGLE TO BALANCE THE COST OF PROVIDING QUALITY DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE CARE WITH THE LIMITED REVENUES AVAILABLE TO THEM THE PANDEMIC HAS EXACERBATED THESE EXISTING CHILD CARE. ISSUES WHILE RAISING SIGNIFICANT NEW CHALLENGES WHICH WE WILL HEAR MORE ABOUT THE IN TODAY'S HEARING DURING THE PANDEMIC MANY CHILD CARE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO CLOSE SOME FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND OTHERS PERMANENTLY WILLMANY OF SINCE WE OPENED THE A FOUND THEMSELVES OPERATING WITH DECREASED ENROLLMENT AND INCREASED INSTABILITY DUE TO THE ONGOING IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC. THIS NEW REALITY POSES A DIRE THREAT TO MANY CHILD CARE PROGRAMS WHICH WERE ALREADY OPERATING ON RAZOR THIN MARGINS AND LACKED THE FINANCIAL RESERVES TO WEATHER NORMALLY HE COULD NORMAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS MUCH LESS SOMETHING AS PROFOUND AS THE RECESSION CAUSED BY THE PANDEMIC WHAT THE CARES ACT PASSED BY CONGRESS IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY PROVIDE STATES PROVIDED STATES WITH THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CHILD CARE DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT. TO SUPPORT ACCESS TO CHILDCARE THIS LEVEL OF FUNDING HAS PROVEN INSUFFICIENT TO MEET THE NEED ESPECIALLY AS THE PANDEMIC HAS STRETCHED ON MEANWHILE CHILD CARE BUSINESSES HAVE DONE THEIR BEST TO CONTINUE TO ASSERT TO SERVE THE CHILDREN OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND OTHERS WHO RELY ON SHELVE CHILD CARE IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE IN THE WORK FORCE ACCORDING TO RESEARCH WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL INVESTMENT HALF OF AMERICA'S CHILD CARE CAPACITY IS CURRENTLY AT RISK OF EXPOSURE. THIS WOULD HAVE A CATASTROPHIC IMPACT ON THE AMERICAN ECONOMY JEOPARDISING THOUSAND CHILDCARE JOBS LEAVING MILLIONS OF CHILDREN WITHOUT ACCESS TO CHILD CARE AND PLUNGING PARENTS. EMPLOYERS FURTHER INTO TURMOIL AS THEY CAN TO YOU TO JUGGLE WORK AND FOR. WERE DESPITE THE CRITICAL ROLE CHILD CARE AND SUPPORTING ECONOMY THERE IS A LACK OF CLEAR UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHAT IT REALLY COSTS. AND WHAT IT TRULY ENTAILS TO PROVIDE QUALITY CHILDCARE PARTICULAR CHILD CARE PROGRAMS FACE NEW GUIDELINES AND CHALLENGES. IN RESPONDING TO THE COVE IN NINETEEN PANDEMICS. THE GOAL TODAY'S HEARING IS TO EXAMINE SOME OF THESE ISSUES IN DEPTH ACROSS A WIDE VARIETY PERSPECTIVES. FROM EXPERTS PARTICIPANTS IN THE FIELD WITH THE GOAL OF STARTING A MUCH NEEDED CONVERSATION. ABOUT NOT ONLY HOW TO BETTER ADDRESS ISSUES AS WE MAKE OUR THREE OUR WAY THROUGH THE RESOLUTION. OF THE CURRENT CRISIS BUT HOW TO DEVISE BETTER POLICIES AND SOLUTIONS MOVING FORWARD ONES THAT WILL NOT ONLY BENEFIT CALIFORNIA'S WORKING FAMILIES. AND THE CHILD CARE PROVIDERS SUPPORTING THEM WHAT ARE THE KEYS TO A BETTER LIFE AND A MORE DYNAMIC CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AS WELL.

THE FINAL PRESENTER- OF OUR OPENING PANEL BERMAN BLOBBY MARIA ANTOINETTE HUNDREDS. APPARENT WITH PARENT VOICES SAN FRANCISCO MISS HUNDREDS BRINGS UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE FROM HER EXPERIENCE NAVIGATING. CALIFORNIA'S SUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE SYSTEM SHE HAS SERVED ON THE CALIFORNIA PRESCHOOL DEVELOPMENT GRANT. PARENT ADVISORY COMMITTEE. WELCOME TO YOU ALL THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND SHARING YOUR INSIGHTS WITH US TODAY. AND WITH THAT MS MORE PLEASE PROCEED DID WITH YOUR TEST. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS JULIE MORE I HAVE BEEN A FAMILY CHILD WRITER. IN MARINO VALLEY FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS I RUN A TWENTY FOUR HOUR DAYCARE AND I EMPLOY FOR ASSISTANCE. I AM A MEMBER OF MY DEALING. CHILD CARE PROVIDERS UNITED. JOINT PROJECT S. C. ARE YOU D. W. ABSOLUTELY I ALSO AM A SINGLE MOTHER OF THREE GROWN CHILDREN THAT NEED NEEDS TO. WORKING WITH CHILDREN IS MY PASSION. I LOVE WHAT I DO BUT WHEN THE PANDEMIC FIRST. I WAS VERY WORRIED I LIVE WITH AN AUTOIMMUNE CONDITION THE FEAR OF GETTING SICK IS STILL VERY REAL. WORK THE GOVERNOR CALLED ESSENTIAL WORKERS HE ASKED US TO PROVIDERS TO STEP UP AND CARE FOR THE CHILDREN OF OTHER ESSENTIAL WORKERS. I STEP UP CHILDREN I CARE FOR PARENTS YOU WORK IN NURSING RETAIL AND FORCE ME I KEEP WORKING SO THEY KEEP WORKING. BUT JUST TELLING US TO STOP. WASN'T ENOUGH WE NEED A ROAD MAP TO MAKE THE PANDEMIC ERA OF CHILDCARE WORK. THE EARLY DAYS WERE EXPRESSLY CHAOTIC THERE WAS SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY. AND I WAS NERVOUS THAT IF I DIDN'T DO EVERYTHING JUST RIGHT OR GET EVRY FAMILY TO AGREE TO PUT A MASK ON YOUR CHILD. THAT COULD WOULD BE CERTAIN TO ENTER MY DAYCARE. AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THE SCHOOLS WERE SHUTTING DOWN. NOW ALL THE STUDY AND WORK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHERS. I HAVE A DISTANT LEARNER WITH ADHD. WE HAVE TO KEEP HIM ENGAGED ONLINE LEARNING MEANWHILE THERE'S TODDLERS IN THE OTHER ROOM SINGING SONGS AND DOING SOMETHING THAT IS MORE INTERESTING. MY GOSH HE DOESN'T WANT TO SIT STILL AND PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT AWKWARD DON'T CALL. I SCRAMBLED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING TO WORK I WAS TRYING TO HELP FAMILIES. HEY KOBE SERIOUSLY WITHOUT LIVING IN FEAR. MOST OF ALL I WAS TRYING TO KEEP OUT AND STAY OPEN. AS MUCH AS I WANT TO I CAN NOT BE AROUND THE STAFFING KIDS BECAUSE OF MY HEALTH ISSUES. SO I HAD TO HAVE I HAD TO HIRE NEW EMPLOYEES AND CREATE TWO SEPARATE ROOMS TO HELP THE KIDS SOCIAL WE DISPENSE. I HAD TO TAKE EVERYTHING OUT AND REMODELED TO MEET PUBLIC HEALTH AND LICENSING GUIDELINES. WHAT SAVINGS I HAD WENT TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES AND TO PURCHASE WHATEVER PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND CLEANING SUPPLIES I CAN FIND. OPERATE THE TRUCK YOU'RE ON MY OWN WITH ALMOST TWENTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS IN GRANTS MY EXPENSES ARE ALREADY PRETTY HIGH BECAUSE OF COLD IT I SPENT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS EVERY GRANT INSIGHT BEEN WENT TOWARDS KOBE NINETEEN EXPENSES IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. I SPENT ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ON CABLE NOW IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. MY PAYROLL ALMOST TRIPLED TO THIRTY ONE THOUSAND. I WAS SHUT DOWN BY PUBLIC HEALTH FOR HAVE YOU CALLED IN MY DAYCARE TWICE WHAT'S SO MANY OF US OPERATIN. WHAT ON RAZOR THIN MARGINS IT'S NO WONDER WE HAVE LOST OVER SIX THOUSAND PROVIDERS DURING DISTRAUGHT DEMI. I HAVE TO ADMIT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT GIVING UP. IN MY STAFF WOULD REASSURE ME THEY'D SAY DON'T WORRY MISTER LEE WE GOT THIS. IT MAY TURN OUT TO BE RIGHT BUT ONLY FOR THE MOMENT. SO MUCH OF THE CHAOS UNCERTAINTY WE WENT FOR A COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES ARE NOT COMPLETELY UNFORESEEN IF WE TRULY CARE ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S CHILD CARE SYSTEM. WE WOULD HAVE A MUCH BETTER WE HAVE WE WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER PREPARED. CHILD CARE IS THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY. IT'S THE WORK THAT MAKES ALL OTHER WORK POSSIBLE. WE NEED TO INVEST IN THE STATE'S CHILD CARE SYSTEM DURING THE GOOD TIMES SO THAT WE CAN WITHSTAND THE HARD TIMES THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU IS MORE ADMINISTRATION PLEASE. THANK YOU CENTER NEWMAN AND THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE FOR THIS INVITATION. I'LL START BY SAYING I DON'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE THE TYPICAL CHILD CARE PROVIDER- THE AVERAGE CHILD CARE PROVIDER IS A THIRTY SIX YEAR OLD WOMAN- LIKELY WOMAN OF COLOR- TODAY LET'S CALL HER MARIA. REGARDING CHILD CARE AFTER ATTENDING YOU SEE CLASSES AT NIGHT. BECAUSE AFTER CARING FOR HER KNEES SHE HAVE THIS FEELING THAT WOULDN'T GO AWAY. THE FEELING OF LOVE SEEM TO CHANGE YOU CAN MAKE IN A CHILD'S LIFE. THE FEELING THAT THIS IS WHAT HER LIFE'S PURPOSE IS. AFTER FIVE YEARS OF CLASSES THREE YEARS OF TEACHING. TO BANK LOANS AND MANY I'LL USE FROM FAMILY AND FRIENDS. REOPEN A ONE CLASS FROM CHILD CARE CENTER SO SHE CAN MAKE CHANGE IN MORE CHILDREN'S LIVES. BASS FORD JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY SIX YEARS AFTER STARTING HER CHILD CARE. SHE'S BEEN RUNNING AND EXPANDING IT NOW SHE HAS FOUR CLASSROOMS AND SHE'S AS PASSIONATE AS EVER. BUT SHE'S TIRED SHE'S TIRED OF THE CONSTANT RATCHETING UP OF REQUIREMENTS TIRED OF THE ANNUAL THREAT OF PK TAKING AWAY HER PROGRAM AND TIRED OF STILL BEING TREATED LIKE SHE'S JUST A BABY SITTER. THE END THAT PANDEMIC HITS ANDREA IS ENVELOPED WITH UNCERTAINTY AND STRESS. BUT SHE ENTERS CONTINUING TO SERVE FAMILIES GROW NEARLY ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND PAYING HER TEACHERS DIRECTLY OUT OF HER MEAGER PERSONAL SAVINGS ACCOUNT. THINGS ARE HARD HARDEST THEY'VE EVER BEEN. BUT THINGS DON'T WORK OUT SHE TELLS HERSELF. FOUR MONTHS LATER JULY FIFTEENTH. ZERO COVER CASES SO FAR. WEARING MASK SOCIAL DISTANCING KEEPING YOUR TEACHERS IN THEIR OWN CLASSROOMS. THE STATE RELEASED AS A PDF A NEW COHORT INCLUDING GUIDANCE. LIMITING THE SIZE OF HER CLASSROOMS RESTRICTING HORATIO'S REQUIRING HER TO DIVIDE CLASSROOMS WITH FLOOR TO CEILING NONPERISHABLE BARRIERS AND KEEP HER TWO YEAR OLDS SIX FEET APART AT ALL TIMES. SHE'S RE READ IT TEN TIMES. THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS SHE HAS TO DO THAT STUFF. SHE CAN'T BELIEVE IT AND SHE SIMPLY CAN'T DO IT. SHE ALREADY CAMPAIGN RENT SHE CAN'T MODIFIER PROGRAM TO THE STANDARDS AND SHE CAN'T EVEN KEEP HER TEACHERS EMPLOYED WHEN THE THREAT OF COVERAGE IS SO GREAT. NOW THESE THINGS ARE NOT GOING TO WORK OUT. IT'S TIME TO QUIT THROW IN THE TOWEL AND SINCE NOONE WILL TAKE OVER CHILDCARE DURING A PANDEMIC SHE SUCH A DOWN FOREVER. REMOVING ALL NINETY SIX TUCKER SPOTS. BUT THE STORY IS NOT OVER C. A WEEK AFTER CLOSING MARIA TALKS TO A FRIEND AND HERE'S AT THE COHORT INCLUDING PDF WASN'T ABOUT REGULATIONS THAT AFTER ALL. IT WAS SIMPLY PROVIDED AS GUIDANCE. BUT THERE IS NOT A LAWYER SHE CAN'T DIFFERENTIATE SHOULD SHALL MUST. AND SHE ALWAYS DOES RIGHT BY OUR CHILDREN OUR FAMILIES OUR STAFF IN THE STATE. WELL THIS GUIDANCE WAS MEANT TO HELP PROVIDERS NAVIGATE BUILDING SAFETY PROCEDURES. BUT MANY OF THEM OUT OF BUSINESS. BECAUSE IT WASN'T CLEAR THAT IT WAS JUST GUIDONS. MANY OF THEM TURNED A SEQUEL AND NONPROFITS LIKE OURS FOR HELP. AS THEY COULD NOT GET CLEAR COMMUNICATIONS FROM STATE AGENCIES. THOSE WE HELPED AND MANY STAYED OPEN. BUT MANY LIKE MARIA DIDN'T GET HELP UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE. IT'S NOT A REAL PERSON. BUT RATHER REPRESENTATION THE EXPERIENCES OF HUNDREDS OF CHAU CARES. MANY OF WHOM ARE STILL EXPERIENCING THE SAME EXACT NEEDLESS ISSUE TODAY. SINCE MARCH 202-200-0100 AND SIXTY CHAO CARES HAVE PERMANENTLY CLOSED STATEWIDE. CHILDCARE PROVIDERS MEANWHILE AND DO WELL. BUT GETS STUCK IN THE OPAQUENESS OF GOVERNMENT SPEAK. THEY GET SNAGGED IN THE RED TAPE RED TAPE OF LICENSING PROCEDURES AND THEY GET PUMMELED WITH LEGISLATION THAT SHRINK THEIR RESOURCES AND INCREASES THEIR EMOTIONAL DEBT EVERY SINGLE YEAR. THE LEGISLATORS AND AGENCIES. WE ASK FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS TO BE GIVING CLEAR AND CONSISTENT GUIDANCE. WE ASKED FOR THE ERASURE OF UNNECESSARY RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD. WE ASK FOR THE SAME RESPECT CARE INDECENCY. TO BE GIVEN THE CENTRAL CHILD CARE WORKERS. AS THEY GET TO OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES EVERY DAY. AND ABOVE ALL YES LEGISLATORS HERE TO ADVOCATE FOR PROVIDERS. B. THE CHILD CARE LEGISLATOR- BACKS WHO BACKS UP AND STANDS UP FOR PROVIDERS WHO OTHERWISE DON'T HAVE A VOICE. BUILD BRIDGES INSTEAD OF BLOCKADES L. DISCOURSE INSTEAD OF DISCORD. AFTER ALL ADVOCATING FOR CHILD CARE IS ADVOCATING FOR OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURES. THANK YOU.

EXCUSE ME ABOUT THE PRESSURES THE CHILD CARE SYSTEM IS STILL UNDER AS THE ECONOMY STRUGGLES PARTICULARLY FOR WORKING FAMILIES.

THE FIRST SPEAKER ON THIS PANEL WILL BE MISS JUDY SINCE THE MORA FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDER LEADER. AND A MEMBER OF CHILD CARE PROVIDERS UNITED MISTER MOORE HAS EXPERIENCED FIRST HAND HOW CRITICAL IT IS FOR PROVIDERS TO BE PRESENT AND FULLY INVOLVED AT EVERY POINT. IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESSES THAT SHAPE EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION CALIFORNIA.

WHILE RESPONDING TO RAPIDLY CHANGING CONDITIONS OR THIRD PRESENTER WILL BE ELSA JACOBSON THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY A CHILD THREE SIXTY WHERE SHE WORKS TO FURTHER POLICIES. THAT ADVANCE EQUITY IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AT THE LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS AND TO ENSURE THE COMMUNITY VOICES TRY POLICY. THE FINAL SPEAKER AND PANEL NUMBER TWO WILL BE DONE A SNEER INJURE CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER FOR THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER. AND A CURRENT MEMBER OF THE FIRST FIVE COMMISSION FOR SACRAMENTO WELCOME TO ALL OF YOU WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR TESTIMONY MR MAURA. WOULD YOU PLEASE START THINGS OFF. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. AND I AM A TELCO PROVIDER IN VICTORVILLE. AND I'VE BEEN A TALKER PROVIDER FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS I AM ALSO A MEMBER OF CHILD CARE PROVIDERS UNITED. A JOINT PROJECT OF THE ACLU AND YOU D. W. A. F. S. C. M. T. A LOT GOES ON IN OUR HOME FAMILY CHILD CARES EVERY DAY I PROVIDING NURTURING ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS AN ACADEMIC EDUCATION. TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. UNFORTUNATELY THE CULTIC PANDEMIC HAS PUT A REAL STRAIN ON CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. WE RISK EXPOSURE TO THE TO THIS LIFE THREATENING VIRUS ON A DAILY BASIS I PERSONALLY PERSONALLY KNOW MANY PROVIDERS WHO HAVE GOTTEN SICK AND THANKFULLY SURVIVE. HOWEVER I ALSO KNOW PROVIDERS WHO HAVE PASSED AWAY AFTER BECOMING INFECTED FROM THE CHILD WHO CAME IN SICK. AND HEIR PARENTS WERE NOT COMPLETELY HONEST WITH THE PROVIDER. YES WE ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. WE KNOW OUR WORK IS MORE NECESSARY THAN EVER. WE ARE GIVING OUR CHILDREN STABILITY ANY TINY BIT OF NORMALCY IN THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES. WE ARE KEEPING THEM LEARNING AS SCHOOLS REMAIN CLOSED. AND WE ARE HELPING PARENTS WERE ALSO ESSENTIAL WORKERS AS THEY CONTINUE TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES DURING THIS CRISIS. EVERY MORNING WE TAKE IN OUR LITTLE ONES AND EVERY DAY WE GO TO EXTREME EFFORTS TO ENSURE THEIR SAFETY AND OUR OWN. WE HAVE ADDED EXTENSIVE CLEANING MEASURES TO OUR PROGRAM. WE CLEAN AND SANITIZE. WASH HANDS CLEAN AND SANITIZE WASH HANDS AGAIN ALL DAY. NEVER THE LESS WITH A SMILE ON OUR FACE WE TACKLE DISTANCE LEARNING I HAVE FOR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN A KINDERGARTENER TO FIRST GRADERS ANY THIRD GRADER. TO ACCOMMODATE THEM FOR CLASS I'VE HAD TO ADD ANOTHER SPACE TO OUR CENTER. WE MADE A PLAY ROOM OUT OF OUR- OUR GARAGE. VERY NOTHING. SO WE MADE A PLAY ROOM OUT OF OUR GARAGE- SO THAT WE CAN KEEP OUR CHILDREN YOUNGER CHILDREN FROM DISTRACTING OR DISTANCE LEARNERS. WE ASSISTED CHILDREN WITH NAVIGATING THE INTERNET GOOGLE CLASSROOM CLASS DOJO ZONE OR WHATEVER PROGRAM THE TEACHER HAS CHOSEN FOR THEIR CLASS FOR THEIR TWO TO THREE HOURS OF SYNCHRONOUS TIME. THE OTHER TWO TO THREE HOURS OF ASYNCHRONOUS TRYING WE ASSIST WITH VARIOUS AGE LEVELS SIMONS. WE TEACH AND SUPPORT THEM WITH THEIR BATH LESSONS WE PROOFREADER WRITING ASSIGNMENTS WE LISTEN TO THEM READ. WE HELP THEM WITH THEIR END OF UNIT BIG PROJECTS. THROUGH IT ALL WE PREPARE MEALS AND YOUR BEST TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A SAFER. ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR CHILDREN. BUT THE SYSTEM BROKEN. AS I'VE HAD BECAUSE I'VE HAD TO DO ALL OF THIS WITH LITTLE TO NO RESOURCES FROM THE STATE BECAUSE OF THIS EVEN THOUGH WE ARE ESSENTIAL AND HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES DURING THE SPEND DOWN NEXT PROVIDERS ARE STRUGGLING TO STAY OPEN. THERE ARE MANY ADDED COST TO OPERATE DURING THE PANDEMIC. I'VE HAD TO RENT STORAGE SPACE TO PUT AWAY EXCESS CHOICE SO THERE'S MORE ROOM FOR JUST. NINETY I HAD TO TAKE A LOAN TO COVER THE COSTS FOR ADDITIONAL CLEANING AND TO ENSURE I CAN DISINFECT AT STAKE THE NATURAL PRODUCTS. AND THERE'S ALWAYS A CONSTANT WORRY OF EXPOSURE. AS MANY PROVIDERS HAVE EXPERIENCED NOT ALL PARENTS QUARANTINE THEIR CHILDREN WHO HAVE COME IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH COLD. AND WHEN PROVIDERS HAVE TO SHUT DOWN TO QUARANTINE MANY OF US DO NOT GET PAID. BECAUSE PARENTS ARE RESOURCE AND AGENCIES SWITCH PROVIDERS WHEN THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IN QUARANTINE. LEADING TO RESOURCE AGENCIES NOT PAYING THE PROVIDER WHO HAD TO QUARANTINE. PARENTS ARE ALSO BY PASSING THE NECESSARY QUARANTINE AND POSSIBLY EXPOSING OTHER CHILD CARE STE. A LOT HAS BEEN ASKED TO TELL CARE PROVIDERS AND WE HAVE STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE. I URGE YOU TO STAND WITH US AND HELP STABILIZE CHILD CARE BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PAID COVERT NINETEEN CLOSER DAYS. FOR PROVIDERS. WHEN WE HAVE TO CLOSE THE CURRENT TEAM AND JUST AS IMPORTANTLY GUARANTEEING PAYMENTS FOR THE SHUTDOWNS. PROVIDER PROVIDING GREATER FINANCIAL SUPPORT YOUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS FOR THE INCREASED COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE FACILITATING DISTANCE LEARNING AND SECURING PP AND CLEANING SUPPLIES. DEVELOPING A CLEAR PLAN TO WORK WITH COUNTY SAM FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS TO ENSURE PRIORITY. CONTACT TRACING BETWEEN HOME HEALTHCARE AND CHILD CARE CENTERS IN ADDITION TO SCHOOLS AND TESTING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU. THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA FAMILIES BEFORE THE PANDEMIC HOWEVER SINCE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY UNTOLD NUMBERS OF CHILD CARE CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE PERMANENTLY SHUT THEIR DOORS. OPERATING UNDER CURRENT CONDITIONS IS CHALLENGING FOR ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE FOR MANY SO OTHERS WILL SURELY FOLLOW. SUPPORTING PUBLIC HEALTH IS EVERYONE'S COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY AND CHILD CARE CENTERS HAVE SHOWN THAT THEY'RE DOING THEIR PART SUCCESSFULLY. CALIFORNIA IS FACING A CHILD CARE CAPACITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE CRISIS. WHICH HAS NOT EVEN BEEN FULLY REALIZED IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO ACT AND THERE STEPS THE STATE CAN TAKE TO HELP CONTAIN THE CRISIS. SO WHAT CAN CALIFORNIA DO. I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON JUST ONE THING THE ONE THING THAT MAY VERY WELL HAVE THE GREATEST POSITIVE IMPACT. THE ISSUE IS COHORT SIZE. WE ALL AGREE THAT MAINTAINING STABLE GROUPS THAT ARE SMALL AS POSSIBLE IS IMPORTANT TO REDUCE THE RISK OF INFECTION AND LIMIT POTENTIAL EXPOSURE. HOWEVER ACCORDING HAS A CORRESPONDING. OF LIMITING THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN A CHILD CARE CENTER CAN AND ROLL THEREBY CONSTRAINING ROBIN. SINCE MOST CHILD CARE CENTERS OPERATE UNDER THIN MARGINS CAPPING ENROLLMENT MEANS CENTERS CAN AT BEST BREAK EVEN. MORE TYPICALLY THEY'RE OPERATING AT A LOSS AND USING PERSONAL RESOURCES TO COVER THE DIFFERENCE. THIS CAN ONLY CONTINUE FOR SO LONG BEFORE A CHILD CARE CENTERS FORCED TO CLOSE ITS DOORS. WITH ENROLLMENT LIMITED AT INDIVIDUAL CHILD CARE CENTERS THAT MEANS CALIFORNIA'S OVERALL CHILD CARE CAPACITY IS REDUCED. AS WE HOPEFULLY EMERGE FROM PANDEMIC EMERGENCY RESPONSE MODE THIS YEAR IT'S CRITICAL TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF COAL COURT LIMITS ON CHILD CARE CAPACITY. IT CHILD CARE CENTERS MUST LIMIT ENROLLMENT WORTH THEY NO LONGER OFFER IN ROOM UNTIL BECAUSE THEY NO LONGER EXIST. FAMILIES WILL HAVE A HARD TIME GOING BACK TO WORK WHICH WILL CONSEQUENTLY PUT A DRAG ON CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY FOR A LONG TIME TO COME. ON THE SUBJECT OF CO HOARDING THE LAST pOF SOCIAL SERVICES IN COLLABORATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. ISSUED GUIDANCE FOR CHILD CARE PROGRAMS AND PROVIDERS WAS ON JULY SEVENTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY. WHILE THE GUIDANCE PROVIDED IN JULY FOUR MONTHS AFTERTHE START OF THE PANDEMIC MAY HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATE AT THE TIME. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT ITS ORIGINAL INTENT WAS TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS TO FOLLOW WHEN STUDENTS MEET FOR TARGETED SUPPORT AND INTERVENTION SERVICES WHILE THE SCHOOL IS CLOSED TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. FOR REASONS THAT ARE NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR CHILD CARE CENTERS WERE INCLUDED IN THIS CATEGORY EVEN THOUGH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES STRICTLY REGULATES CHILD CARE CENTERS AND DETERMINES CHILD CARE CAPACITY BASED ON THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF CLASSROOMS. INTERESTINGLY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES REQUIRES MINIMUM INDOOR SQUARE FOOTAGE IN CHILD CARE CENTERS AT THIRTY FIVE PER CHILD. IF YOU DO THE MATH THE MINIMUM SQUARE FOOTAGE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN SIX FOOT FOR PHYSICAL DISTANCE IS A BIT LESS THAN THIRTY PER INDIVIDUAL. THE POINT IS THIS CHILD CARE CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE ALREADY LICENSED TO ENSURE PHYSICAL DISTANCING FOR UP TO THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF CHILDREN THEY ARE ALLOWED TO ENROLL. BUT CHILD CARE CENTERS ARE AT YET ANOTHER DISADVANTAGE. UNDER CALIFORNIA'S RE OPENING FRAMEWORK FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS ONCE THE SCHOOL IS OPEN THE COHORT SIZE IS UNSPECIFIED. MEANING THE NUMBER OF GROUP MEMBERS CAN VARY BASED ON THE SIZE OF THE PHYSICAL SPACE PROBE PROVIDED MEMBERSHIP IS FIXED AND STABLE. THERE IS NO SUCH CONSIDERATION FOR CHILD CARE CENTERS WHICH POSES SERIOUS SHORT TERM CONSEQUENCES TO THE VIABILITY OF CHILD CARE CENTERS THE SUCCESSFUL RE OPENING OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND THE LONG TERM STATE OF CHILD CARE CAPACITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA. SO HERE'S THE KEY TAKEAWAY. REGARDLESS OF THE RATIONALE FOR PUTTING GREATER OPERATING RESTRICTIONS ON CHILD CARE CENTERS THAT ARE IN PLACE FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS. CONTINUING WITH THIS APPROACH WILL HAVE DEVASTATING LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES THE CHILD CARE CAPACITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE. TITLE TWENTY TWO REGULATIONS ARE MORE THAN ADEQUATE TO ENSURE COHORT SIZES ARE KEPT AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE AND PROVIDES CHILD CARE CENTERS WITH THE SAME IMPORTANT FLEXIBILITY THAT K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS HAVE TO OPERATE SAFELY. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE ON THIS PANEL I APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU'RE DOING TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND WISH YOU ELL AS WE PREPARE TO EMERGE FROM THIS CRISIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER MERRICK MISS JACOBSON PLEASE YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO FILL THIS BEAR WITH ME FOR ONE MINUTE I'M GOING TO SHARE MY SCREEN SO THAT YOU CAN SEE MY POWER POINT. ALL RIGHT HOPEFULLY YOU CAN SEE THAT. I'M GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS ALSO JACOBSON AND I SERVICE THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY FOR CHILD THREE SIXTY OR A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT PROVIDES COACHING ASSESSMENTS AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TRAINING TO NEARLY SIX HUNDRED EARLY LEARNING PROVIDERS ACROSS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO WORK VERY HARD TO ENSURE THAT COMMUNITY VOIGTS STRIVES POLICY BY ELEVATING THE PERSPECTIVES OF CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND PARENTS LEGISLATORS LIKE YOURSELVES. LAST FALL IN PARTNERSHIP WITH EARLY EDGE CALIFORNIA AND THE CHILD CARE LINES OF LOS ANGELES WE ADMINISTERED AN ONLINE SURVEY TO NEARLY SIX HUNDRED CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND TEACHERS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE LEARNED A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THEIR CLOSELY RELATED CHALLENGES AND I LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF THE KEY FINDINGS WITH YOU. IN PART TO SHOW THAT THE EXPERIENCES THAT HAVE BEEN SHARED TODAY BY PROVIDERS AND PARENTS ARE EMBLEMATIC OF CHALLENGES THAT ARE WIDESPREAD. TO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT ABOUT THE SURVEY. 74% OF SURVEY RESPONDENTS WORKED AT LICENSED CHILD CARE CENTERS AND CHILD CARE HOMES. WHERE CARE IS PROVIDED IN AN INDIVIDUAL'S HOME. THE VAST MAJORITY OF PROVIDER RESPONDENTS RECEIVE SOME FORM OF STATE AND OR FEDERAL FUNDING. AND A LITTLE OVER HALF PROVIDE EITHER EXCLUSIVELY IN PERSON CARE OR DISTANCE LEARNING AND FORTY THREE POINT 2% ACCOMPLISH THE HERCULEAN FEAT. A PROVIDING BOTH IN PERSON CARE AND DISTANCE LEARNING. IN ADDITION A LITTLE OVER 85% OF SURVEY RESPONDENTS WERE PEOPLE OF COLOR. THIS IS UNSURPRISING GIVEN THAT WOMEN OF COLOR MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILD CARE WORKFORCE AND THEY HAVE DEEPLY FELT THE IMPACTS OF THE KOBE NINETEEN CAN DAMAGE. WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THEIR PROGRAMS WERE FACING LOW ENROLLMENT WAS THE MOST FREQUENTLY CITED CHALLENGE. OF THE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY PROVIDERS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THEY WERE OPERATING AT OR BELOW CAPACITY SEVENTY ONE POINT 6% REPORTED THAT THEY WERE OPERATING BELOW CAPACITY. AND CENTERS. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE LOWER ENROLLMENT HAS MEANT LESS INCOME FOR PROVIDERS WHO OPERATED ON RAZOR THIN MARGINS EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. OF THE THREE HUNDRED A PROVIDERS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT THE REVENUE FIFTY POINT 6% REPORTED THAT THERE WAS A GAP BETWEEN THEIR MONTHLY COSTS AND THEIR REVENUE OR REIMBURSEMENT. IT'S WORRISOME BUT PERHAPS UNSURPRISING THAT MANY PROVIDERS HAVE CLOSED TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY DURING THE PANDEMIC. ADDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES BETWEEN MARCH AND DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY THEY WERE NEARLY SEVEN THOUSAND CLOSURES OF LICENSED FAMILY CHILD CARE HOMES 200-040-0403 OF WHICH WERE PERMANENT. AND WE'RE OVER NINETY FIVE HUNDRED CLOSURES OF LICENSED CHILD CARE CENTERS FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN OF WHICH WERE PERMANENT. THESE NUMBERS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT CLOSURES OF THE APPROXIMATELY NINETEEN THOUSAND LICENSE EXAM PROVIDERS THAT RECEIVE STATE SUBSIDIES. SOME PROVIDERS INITIALLY HAD TO CLOSE TEMPORARILY TO PREPARE THEIR SITES TO MEET NEW HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS AND OTHERS AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY HAVE HAD TO CLOSE AND THEN REOPEN SOMETIMES MULTIPLE TIMES WHEN THEY'RE BEEN CUT OUTBREAKS. AND SEVERAL THOUSAND OTHERS HAVE CLOSED THEIR DOORS FOR GOOD. IN OUR SURVEY WE ALSO ASKED PROVIDERS WHAT COSTS THEY WERE MOST WORRIED ABOUT BEING ABLE TO COVER DURING THE YEAR. AND THE CUSTOMERS JUST MOST WORRISOME AMONG BOTH CENTERS AND FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WERE CLEANING SUPPLIES IN PP. FACILITIES COSTS AND PERSONNEL. BEING ABLE TO AFFORD RENT AND MORTGAGE CLASS WAS ALSO CITED BY FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AS A TOP CHALLENGE. NOW WE KNOW THAT MANY PROVIDERS RECEIVE CLEANING SUPPLIES IN PP FROM THEIR LOCAL RESOURCE AND REFERRAL AGENCIES. THIS IS CERTAINLY BEEN HELPFUL TO PROVIDERS ARE REQUIRED SUCCESSFUL COORDINATION BETWEEN MULTIPLE AGENCIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. BUT AS YOU HEARD FROM PROVIDERS TODAY THE MOST CONSISTENTLY AND DAILY CLEAN AND DISINFECT COMMON SURFACES IN TOYS CONDUCT TEMPERATURE CHECKS AND WEARING CHANGE MASKS SO THEY NEED FOR P. P. AND CLEANING SUPPLIES IS ONGOING. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEIR FACILITIES COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MEETING NEW HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. IN OUR SURVEY PROVIDERS MOST FREQUENTLY INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD UTILIZE ANY FACILITIES IMPROVEMENT DOLLARS TO BETTER SUPPORT HAND WASHING SOCIAL DISTANCING AND FACILITIES MODIFICATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE THIS FUNDING MIGHT BE USED FOR PORTABLE SINKS NO TOUCH FAUCETS OR SOAP AND PAPER TOWEL DISPENSERS TO HELP WITH HAND WASHING. OR IT MIGHT BE USED FOR PARTITIONS OR CONVERSIONS OF SPACES IN THE CLASSROOMS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCING. OR THE FUNDING MIGHT BE USED TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO ENSURE GREATER OUTDOOR SHADE AND WEATHER PROTECTION TO ENABLE CHILDREN TO SPEND MORE TIME OUTDOORS. IN OUR SURVEY WE ALSO ASKED TEACHERS AND PROVIDERS WHAT TYPE OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THEY WERE MOST INTERESTED IN RECEIVING. AN INTERESTINGLY THE TRAINING TOPIC MOST FREQUENTLY REQUESTED WAS WORKING WITH CHILDREN WITH CHALLENGING BEHAVIORS. WE KNOW THAT FOR MANY OF OUR CHILDREN THEIR BEHAVIOR IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO TRAUMA THAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED BEFORE THEY ENTER THE CHILD CARE SETTING WHICH HAS ONLY BEEN EXACERBATED BY COULD. EASY PROFESSIONALS HAVE EXPRESSED DESIRE TO BE EQUIPPED WITH STRATEGIES ON HOW TO BETTER SERVE THESE CHILDREN IN THEIR CARE. EVERY DAY EARLY CHILDHOOD PROVIDERS AND TEACHERS PROVIDE A CRITICAL MEASURE OF SECURITY AND STABILITY TO THOUSANDS OF PARENTS MANY OF WHOM ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. A TAKE ON THE DIFFICULT TASK OF HELPING VERY YOUNG CHILDREN STAY SOCIALLY DISTANCING MAST OR CREATING ENGAGING DISTANCE LEARNING ACTIVITIES FOR THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS. AND THEY PUT THEIR OWN HEALTH AND THE HEALTH OF THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AT RISK ON A DAILY BASIS. IS RESILIENT COMMENDED EASY PROFESSIONALS THE MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE WOMEN OF COLOR. DESERVE THE STATE'S RECOGNITION AND SUPPORT THREE FLEXIBLE STIPENDS TO COVER CLEANING FACILITIES AND OTHER CODE RELATED COSTS FOR RE OPENING GRANTS FOR EXTENDING THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION. THROUGH TARGETED PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND THROUGH FAIR PAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR MISTAKEN NEXT HEAR FROM DONNA'S INJURE- MISS OR PER GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TODAY ABOUT THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THE CHILD CARE SYSTEM IS PROVIDED TO OUR STATE DURING THE RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE OTHER PANELISTS- WHO REALLY HAVE SHOWN A LIGHT ON. ALL OF THE HARD WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE BY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND WE ARE ALL INDEBTED TO THEM FOR THE RISKS THEY TAKE AND THE AND THE ROAD WORK THAT THEY HAVE DONE. AS OF. AS OR MY OR- THE CHILD RESOURCE CENTER IN A NON ORGANIZATION WE SEARCH SERVE A LARGE- SERVICE AREA IN LOS ANGELES AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. AND WE OUR SISTER AGENCY TO SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS ALL AROUND CALIFORNIA AND I WANT TO TALK TO DO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE LESSONS WE'VE LEARNED. WHAT IS NEEDED AND WHAT HAS BEEN WORKING AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO GOING FORWARD TO HELP OUR CHILD CARE INFRASTRUCTURE AND OUR PROVIDERS RECOVER. SO I THINK THE LESSON THAT THE WORLD LEARNS OUR COMMUNITIES LEARNED WAS ONE THAT WE ALREADY KNEW CHILD CARE IS ESSENTIAL. AND IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR OUR FAMILIES TO BE ABLE TO GO TO WORK AND IT WAS APPARENT IN THE VERY EARLY HOURS OF THE PANDEMIC THAT THAT ONE IS CRITICAL FOR OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS. WHAT WE ALSO LEARNED AS MANY OF OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS ARE NOT VERY HIGHLY PAID AND MANY OF THEM ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A CHILD CARE SUBSIDY BUT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH SUBSIDIES TO GO AROUND BECAUSE OUR SYSTEM ONLY SERVES ONE IN NINE ELIGIBLE CHILDREN- WE ALSO LEARNED THAT. OUR LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN PLACE BUT NOT WELL RESOURCE AND IT WORKED VERY QUICKLY TO RESPOND TO THE PANDEMIC AND I WILL TALK ABOUT SOME OF WHAT WAS DONE. BUT THERE'S MORE TO DO AND THE CRITICAL NEED TO HAVE THAT LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO SUPPORT PROVIDERS. AND SUPPORT THE FAMILIES IS IT IS NECESSARY FOR US TO GET THROUGH THE REST OF THE PANDEMIC AND ALSO AS WE MOVE FORWARD. SO OUR LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE REALLY RESPONDED VERY QUICKLY TO THE PANDEMIC- ARE PROGRAMS WHICH ARE LARGELY HOUSED IN COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS OR- LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES WORKED QUICKLY WITH OUR LOCAL FIRST FIVE COMMISSIONS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. TO TRY TO GET RESOURCES OUT TO PROVIDERS. WE'VE WORKED THROUGH OUR STATE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ESSENTIAL WORKER VOUCHERS FOR THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA MY AGENCY ALONE IN THE WORLD TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED ADDITIONAL FAMILY IS. TO RECEIVE CHILD CARE SERVICES AND WE ALSO WORKED TO PROVIDE REFERRALS TO HELP THEM FIND CHILD CARE AS MANY PROVIDERS WERE CLOSED AS HAS BEEN ALREADY STATED. OUR RESOURCE AND REFERRAL PROGRAM WORKS WITH FIRST FIVE AND OTHER LOCAL ENTITIES TO PROVIDE NECESSARY SUPPLIES AND SERVICES- AT MY AGENCY WE'VE DISTRIBUTED OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FACE MASKS FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND DIAPERS THIRTEEN THOUSAND BAGS OF FOOD AND TWELVE THOUSAND DIFFERENT TYPES OF CLEANING SUPPLIES. AND IT'S SOMETHING WE CONTINUE TO DO ON A REGULAR BASIS PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC WE WEREN'T A DISTRIBUTION CENTER WE WEREN'T USED TO RECEIVING PALLETS OF GOODS THAT WE THEM DISTRIBUTED TO OUR PROVIDERS BUT WE ARE NOW AND IT IS SOMETHING WE CONTINUE TO DO ON A WEEKLY BASIS AT ALL OF OUR LOCATIONS. WE'VE ALSO RECEIVED A LOT OF LOCAL DONATIONS FROM BUSINESS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO HELP BUT THERE STILL IS NOT ENOUGH AND WE CONTINUE TO TRY TO SEEK RESOURCES AND SUPPORT FOR OUR PROVIDERS. WE ALSO WORK THROUGH GRANTS THAT WERE PROVIDED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ISSUE STIPENDS TO CHILD CARE PROVIDERS THIS PAST FALL- IT WAS  START- WE NEED TO DO MORE AND IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT I THINK THAT PROVIDERS COMMENTS ABOUT. THE COSTS THEY HAVE TAKEN ON TO BE OPEN AND OPERATING AS WELL AS THE LIMITED ADULT TO CHILD RATIOS MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO STAY IN BUSINESS AND IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE. TO SUPPORT THOSE EFFORTS. WHAT I REALLY LIKE TO. ON IS HAS WERE. AND WE NEED TO DO GOING FORWARD THROUGH THE PANDEMIC- THE FIRST THING IS THE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO VOUCHERS FOR ESSENTIAL WORKERS. AS I MENTIONED WE'VE ENROLLED THOUSANDS OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS THERE ARE THOUSANDS MORE WAITING WE STILL ARE WORKING TO TRY TO MAKE SURE FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO THE CARE THAT THEY NEED. THE OTHER THING TO HAVE IN CONSIDERATION AS WE LOOK AT THIS IS THE COST OF HAVING SCHOOLS CLOSED ON THE CHILD CARE SYSTEM. MANY OF THE PROVIDERS MENTIONED THAT THEY ARE NOW. KRACHT DURING K. TWELVE EDUCATION IN THEIR CHILD CARE SETTING AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS IT'S ADDITIONAL COST IT'S ADDITIONAL INTERNET IT'S ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TIME AND STAFFING BUT IT'S AN ALSO AN ADDITIONAL COST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PAYING FOR FULL TIME CARE FOR SCHOOL AGED CHILDREN. AND WE HAD- AN INCIDENT IN THE FALL WHERE WE HAD TO GO BACK AND TRY TO INCREASE THE DOLLARS WE HAD AVAILABLE UNFORTUNATELY IT IS SUCCESSFULLY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE IT COSTS MORE TO HAVE THE SCHOOLS CLOSED IN THE CHILD CARE SYSTEM. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CASH SUPPORT TO PROVIDERS. WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL THE DIFFERENT COST PROVIDERS ARE HAVING TO ENCOURAGE THAT'S CRITICAL FOR THAT. AND WE ALSO NEED TO CONTINUE PAYING PROVIDERS BASED ON THEIR ENROLLMENT NOT THE ATTENDANCE WE KNOW FAMILIES ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO MITIGATE THEIR OWN RISK AND TO KEEP OUR PROVIDERS STABLE AND OPEN WE'VE GOT TO PAY THEM. TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN. AND WE ALSO NEED TO DO SOME WORK YOU HEARD THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PROVIDERS THAT ARE TEMPORARILY CLOSED WE'VE LOST SOME THAT WILL NEVER COME BACK BUT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS TO KEEP OUR PROVIDERS OPEN. TO HELP STABILIZE THEM AND TO RE OPEN SOME OF THESE PROVIDERS. WHO ARE TEMPORARILY CLOSED. THAT'S TO GET US THROUGH THIS PANDA. ONCE WE START TO STABILIZE THERE ARE ONGOING THINGS THE STATE NEEDS TO CONSIDER TO REALLY RESTORE AND BRING OUR PROVIDERS BACK SO THAT OUR- PARENTS HAVE THESE OPTIONS SO THEY CAN GO TO WORK FIRST AND FOREMOST WE HAVE TO INCREASE OUR REIMBURSEMENT RATES TO CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. WE'VE ASKED THESE WOMEN LARGELY WOMEN OF COLOR TO STEP UP TAKE RISKS THEY BEEN HEROES DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND WE'RE NOT PAYING THEM THE CURRENT MARKET COST OF PROVIDING CARE I THINK THAT SHAMEFUL AND I THINK WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THAT IMMEDIATELY WE NEED TO PROVIDE ON GOING SUPPORT TO OPEN A NEW PROVIDERS AND SUPPORT THOSE THAT ARE IN BUSINESS TO EXPAND THEIR SERVICES. WE'VE LOST QUITE A CHUNK OF OUR CHILD CARE SUPPLY WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH BEFORE WE STARTED SO THIS IS GOING TO BE A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE WE NEED TO MAKE SOME INVESTMENTS IN THIS LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAS BEEN WORKING SO HARD TO SUPPORT FAMILIES AND PROVIDERS I AM I WILL SAY THE RESOURCE AND REFERRAL PROGRAMS HAVE HAD THE SAME. FUNDING FOR THE BOUT THE PAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND OBVIOUSLY THAT HASN'T KEPT UP WITH THE COST OF DOING WHAT WE'RE ASKED TO DO I'M SO THERE ARE NEEDS FOR THAT LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE STRENGTHENED SO WE'RE READY FOR FUTURE- CHALLENGES THAT OUR STATE WILL FACE AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST I WANT TO REALLY UNDERSCORE WHAT ELSE MENTIONED ABOUT TRAUMA. WE ARE ALL EXPERIENCING A TRAUMATIC EVENT THIS YEAR HAS BEEN TRAUMATIC FOR EVERYONE ESPECIALLY FOR OUR CHILDREN AND FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS FOR OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS FOR OUR FAMILIES AND ESPECIALLY FOR OUR YOUNG CHILDREN OFTEN YOUNG KIDS ARE NOT. CONSIDERED HARD TO OF THE MENTAL HEALTH RESPONSE SYSTEM THEY DO DISPLAY THEIR TRAUMA THROUGH CHALLENGING BEHAVIOR AND IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WERE THERE WITH OUR PROVIDERS AND PARENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS. AROUND THAT NEED. TO RECOVER AND BE RESILIENT AND MOVE FORWARD IN THEIR LIVES IN A HEALTHY WAY. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THE TIME TO SPEAK. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU TO EACH OF THE PANELISTS AS WELL. LET'S MOVE TO THE FINAL PANEL- WILL UNDER THE HEADING OF CHILD CARE IN THE POST PANDEMIC ECONOMIC RECOVERY WE WILL HEAR FROM EXPERTS IN SOME OF THE ISSUES AND PRIORITIES THAT CALIFORNIA'S POLICYMAKERS SHOULD CONSIDER AS WE SEEK TO STABILIZE AND REINVIGORATE THE SHELTER INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE STATE IN ORDER TO BETTER HARNESS THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS THAT ACCOMPANY A ROBUST EFFECTIVE TRUCKERS SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS FAMILIES AND PROVIDERS OUR FIRST PANELIST WILL BE DAVID RATTRAY THE PRESENT CEO OF UNITE LA A NONPROFIT THAT LEADS EDUCATION REFORM AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO BENEFIT THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. WILL NEXT HEAR FROM SHELLEY MEASURE CALIFORNIA STATE DIRECTOR AT THE COUNCIL FOR A STRONGER AMERICA A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION THAT UNITES EADERS IN BUSINESS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE RETIRED MILITARY TO ADVOCATE FOR PROGRAMS AND POLICIES THAT ENABLE KIDS TO BE HEALTHY AND SUCCESSFUL OUR LAST PANELISTS THIS MORNING WILL BE DR NANCY HERBERT CHAIR AN EMERITUS PROFESSOR IN THE EARLY CHILDHOOD STUDIES DEPARTMENT AT CAL POLY POMONA AND KOHLI CONSULTANT THE PARTNERSHIPS AND EDUCATION ARTICULATION AND COLLABORATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION ALSO KNOWN BY ITS VERY CUTE ACRONYM PEACH. PEACH CHANGE TO STRENGTHEN AND SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PATHWAYS AND RELATED EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR BOTH THE CURRENT AND FUTURE EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION WORKFORCE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THANK YOU ALL FOR SHARING YOUR INSIGHTS WITH THE COMMITTEE THIS MORNING WE WELCOME YOU AND LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR TESTIMONY MR RATTRAY IF YOU COULD PLEASE REFER SEE. THANK YOU AND- THIS MY VIDEO OF MY AUDIO WORKING OKAY A PRETTY HERE'S ALL RIGHT. IT IS YOU'RE GOOD. YEAH ALL RIGHT OUT THAT AS A YES- WELL FOR OF ALL THE SAN- THANK SO MUCH FOR DOING THIS I BEEN VERY MOVED. BYE BYE COLLEAGUES IN I'M HOW TO- BE AMONGST THE REST OF MY- IN HEARING THEIR- INCREDIBLE TESTIMONY SO- I I'LL BRING A PERSPECTIVE AS A FORMER BUSINESS EXECUTIVE- I SPENT TWENTY YEARS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN SOME TRAINED TO THINK MORE LIKE HOW TO BUILD A BUSINESS. THEN I AM CERTAINLY AN EXPERT IN EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION- AND SO ONE OF THINGS THAT I WANTED TO SHARE AS WE HAD JUST RECENTLY COMMISSIONED. A STUDY TO LOOK AT THE BENEFITS TO THE OVERALL ECONOMY. WELL PAID- EARLY CARE AND WORKFORCE. AND WE COMMISSION BEACON ECONOMICS TO LOOK AT THIS IN L. A. COUNTY- AND NOT SURPRISINGLY- WHAT WE SHOWED WAS. IN L. A. COUNTY WE PAID OUR- REALLY CARE. IN IT WORKERS LIKE WE SHOULD ASK. IT WOULD ADD FIVE POINT TWO BILLION TO EIGHT POINT ONE BILLION OF ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC OUTPUT IN THE LA ECONOMY ALONE. YOU CAN IMAGINE SENATOR WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN ACROSS THE WHOLE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S OF OUR ATTEMPTED ON WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW IS THE BENEFITS TO CHILDREN OF HIGH QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO CHILD CARE AND- EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION- SO. I WANT TO SHOULD I WILL APPLY FOR THIS- AND- YOU STILL HEAR ME OKAY. I WANT TO- TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT REBUILDING THIS SECTOR- THE GOOD NEWS IS IN STE DESPITE THE SEARCH CHALLENGES THAT SPENT WELL ARTICULATED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS POISED TO PROVIDE ANOTHER FORTY BILLION. THROUGH THE ONE POINT NINE TRILLION DOLLAR. RESCUE ACT THAT THE PRESIDENT IS PUTTING THROUGH THE CONGRESS IN ON TOP OF THAT DECEMBER MONEY WHICH IS ABOUT TEN BILLION- WE EXPECT TO SEE AS MUCH AS FIFTY BILLION. OF EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION DOLLARS THAT WILL BE WILL COME ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN CALIFORNIA WILL GET THE LARGEST SHARE- OUR RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THIS MONEY TO USE AND REALLY INNOVATIVE WICKS. AND WAYS THAT ARE NOT LIKE TYPICAL. MOST OFTEN MONIES LIKE THIS IS OUR PUT OUT ON A FORMULA BASIS. AND BASED ON A ROMANCE AND WE THINK A BIG PART OF IT SHOULD BE USED MORE WITH MORE THE WAY WE WOULD DO IF WE ARE VENTURE CAPITALIST AND WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO STIMULATE. NEW BUSINESSES COMING INTO EXISTENCE AND IN THAT WAY I THINK IT'S GONNA BE COUNTER TO THAT FOR THE GOVERNMENT IT'S HARD SOMETIMES FOR US TO THINK THAT WAY AS THE PUBLIC SECTOR. BUT I THINK WE ARE SUSPEND A LOT OF THE NORMAL- KIND REQUIREMENTS SUSPEND THINGS LIKE- EVERY ALL MONEY GOES OUT THE SON OF ROMANCE AND OTHER SORT OF FORMULAIC THINGS. AND MAKE LIKE A LOT OF OUR PREVIOUS MY PREVIOUS COLLEAGUE SAID MAKE A LOT OF THIS MONEY AVAILABLE TO HELP THESE BUSINESSES RECOVER AND RESTART. AND THAT MEANS THIS NEED TO BE FLEXIBLE DOLLARS MUCH LIKE THE PPP LOANS WERE THAT WERE PUT OUT BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- THAT PROVIDE CASH RIGHT UP FRONT AND PROVIDE. RESOURCES TO HELP. THESE CHILD CARE CENTERS IT HAD. SHUT DOWN HARPER. WITH SOME C. MONEY TO REALLY COME BACK. AND GIVE THE- A GOOD OF TIME SO THERE IS. CAN REALLY. REBUILD ITSELF. AND WE NEED TO HAVE SOME INNOVATION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOLKS TO IMAGINE A DIFFERENT WAY OF FUNCTIONING IN INCENTIVE DOLLARS. AS MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT- CENTERS BEING OUT TO OPEN STAY OPEN. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN IN PROVIDE OUR PARENTS WHAT THEY NEED- WE NEED A LOT MORE CREATIVITY TO DO THAT. AND THEN I WOULD JUST ADD THAT WE NEED AN EYE TOWARD THE FUTURE TOO WE SHOULD BE. USING THESE RESOURCES TO REBUILD THE SECTOR BUT MUCH LIKE- THE MASTER PLAN THAT THE GOVERNOR EXPLAINED IN COLORS PUT OUT- IN DECEMBER HE HAS MAINTAINED A VISION TOWARD TWENTY THIRTY AND HOW DO WE BUILD THE SECTOR. THAT WE WANT TO SEE. IN THE FUTURE SO THAT IF WE DO THINGS IN THE SHORT TERM WE'RE NOT ONLY BUILDING BACK TO SECTOR BUT WE'RE ALSO BUILDING AND IN A WAY THAT PUTS US ON A TRAJECTORY TOWARD. THE LONG TERM- KIND OF SECTOR WE WANT TO SEE- SO THAT WOULD BE MY BIGGEST ENCOURAGE MINISTERS TO BE SUPER INNOVATIVE WITH THE POINT THAT THE DOLLARS WERE GOING TO GET- SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S AN HONOR TO BE ON THIS PANEL AND I'M I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS OR SUPPORT IN THE FUTURE IN AB IDEAS THAT FLOW FROM THIS. THANK AND THANK YOU MISTER RECORD- NEXT TO MISS MAJOR IF. YOU IF YOU WOULD PROCEED PLEASE. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORE. THE GIRL I CENTER NEWMAN OF THE I YOU FOR INVITING READY NAY HOME RECORD TO TODAY HEARING I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION SYSTEM SPECIFICALLY IN RELATION TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC WELL BEING AS- MISTER ACT REGISTERED BEFORE ME SO AS A REMINDER MY NAME IS SHOWING IS- I'M THE CALIFORNIA DIRECTOR FOR THE COUNCIL FOR STRONG AMERICA. THE UMBRELLA NONPROFIT THAT INCLUDES READING NATION WHICH IS A BUSINESS LEADER MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION WITH OVER THREE THOUSAND EXECUTIVES WHO WORKED ABOUT THIS SKILLED WORKFORCE BY PROVIDING EVIDENCE BASED SOLUTIONS WILL PREPARE CHILDREN TO SUCCEED IN EDUCATION WORK AND LIFE. SOME BEHALF OF OUR CALIFORNIA READY NATION MEMBERS. ABOUT THREE HUNDRED HERE I WHO REPRESENTED A FIRST SET OF SECTORS AND SIZES OF COMPANIES I. WOULD LIKE TO JUST TALK ABOUT TWO POINTS. FIRST IS THE NOTION THAT A ROGUE SAYS EARLY LEARNING CARE AND ALL COMMUNITIES ACROSS OUR STATE PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THAT COMMUNITY. WE HEARD ABOUT LA BUT THAT'S TRUE ACROSS THE STATE WITHOUT AFFORDABLE ACCESSIBLE AND QUALITY EARLY LEARNING CARE NOT ONLY DO WORKING FAMILIES AND EMPLOYERS SUFFER BUT SUBSTANTIAL AND LONG LASTING ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OCCUR. HOW HIGH ARE THE STAKES FOR OUR WORKING FAMILIES TAX PAYERS AND EMPLOYERS. ARE READY NATION REPORT WANT TO STRENGTHEN THE ECONOMY FIX THE CHILD CARE CRISIS NOTES OF THE PROJECTED ANNUAL COST OF LACK OF RELIABLE INFANT TODDLER CARE IN CALIFORNIA. IS NINE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS. THIS IS PRETTY COLD AT NINE POINT ONE MILLION AND THE FIGURE CONSISTS OF THE LAST EARNINGS PRODUCTIVITY AND REVENUE. I'LL JUST BREAK IT DOWN AS THE ECONOMIC. OCCURS IN AN INTER RELATED WAY. SO EACH YEAR A CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF THREE WITHOUT SUFFICIENT CHILDCARE. FOR THOSE FAMILIES THEY LIVE WITH AN AVERAGE OF THIRTY THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS PER WORKING PARENTS. AND LOST EARNINGS AND THEN TIME SPENT LOOKING FOR WORK IT WILL BE FLEXIBLE. IN OUR STUDY PARENTS REPORTED REPORTED SPENDING LESS TIME AT WORK DUE TO CHILD CARE PROBLEMS ON AVERAGE TWO HOURS PER WEEK. THERE I WAIT THEY LEAVE EARLY THEY MISSED DAYS ARE BEING DISTRACTED I KNOW CERTAINLY THAT HAPPENED FOR MYSELF WHEN MY KIDS WERE IN CHILD CARE. AND WE KNOW THAT WHEN. THAT HAPPENS WE LOSE INCOME. ROSS ELEVEN MILLION PARENTS CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF THREE IN THE UNITED. THE BURDEN IS SEVEN BILLION PER YEAR. PANDEMIC HAS CERTAINLY ONLY EXACERBATED EXISTING CHALLENGES WHICH WE'VE HEARD ABOUT HER PRIOR TESTIMONY AND WE KNOW BECAUSE WE READ ABOUT IN THE PAPER EVERY DAY. BUT MOTHERS ARE CARRYING THE BURDEN OF OUR INADEQUATE CHILD CARE SYSTEM. AB BUCKMASTER IS THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CHAMBER SAN MATEO COUNTY AND A READING NATION MEMBER SHE'S A LONGTIME ADVOCATE FOR CHILD CARE POINTS TO STUDIES THAT SHOW THE MAGNITUDE OF JOB LOSSES FOR WOMEN DURING THE PANDEMIC. WILL HAVE A LONG TERM IMPACT ON BUSINESSES ABILITY TO HIRE AND RETAIN THE BEST TALENT. AND AS WE HAVE HEARD FROM OUR CHILD CARE HEROES. THE COLEMAN NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS FORCED MANY MOTHERS OF THE WORKS. OUT OF THE WORKFORCE. TIME AWAY AND DECREASED PRODUCTIVITY AT WORK DUE TO CHILDCARE ISSUES. I DON'T MIND THE CURRENT AND FUTURE ECONOMIC STABILITY OF FAMILIES. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE AS WE HEARD FROM EARLIER HOME BASED CHILDCARE AND ALL OF ITS FORMS AS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT SUPPORTING MANY WORKING FAMILIES. PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT WORK IN NONTRADITIONAL WORK SCHEDULES. IN CALIFORNIA ALONE THESE PROVIDERS CONTRIBUTE ONE POINT. FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO OUR ECONOMY. BUSINESS EMPLOYED WORKING. ISN'T OF A HEADER FIFTY TO. PER WORKING. A REDUCED. AN EXTRA HIGH BECAUSE- ANNUALLY ACROSS THE THAT THIRTEEN BILLION PER YEAR. IT JUST MAKES SENSE THAT A WORKFORCE THE FLASK PRODUCTIVE OR HAVE JUST A SHORTER TIME. TENURE DO I CAN AFFECT WORKING I DOWN MORALE DIMINISHING PRODUCT QUALITY AND POSSIBLY LOSING CLIENTS. ADDITIONAL A. R. TAXPAYERS LOSE AN AVERAGE OF SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY DOLLARS PER WORKING PARENT AND LOWER INCOME TAX AND SALES TAX REVENUE. AN AGGREGATE THIS MONTH TO SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS NATIONALLY. THE SECOND IS EXTENDING EARLY QUALITY EARLY LEARNING CARE TO ALL YOUNG CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING POVERTY IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO DEVELOP A SKILLED AND DIVERSE FUTURE WORKFORCE. WHEN WE DON'T INVEST ADEQUATELY IN EARLY LEARNING AND CARE OUR ECONOMY TAKES A HIT IN FUTURE LOSSES AND COSTS THAT WE OCCUR WITH THAT WE ENCOURAGE SORRY ONE WORKERS ARE NOT WELL TRAINED. THEY HAVE TOO LITTLE OR THEY HAVE TOO LITTLE EXPERIENCE AS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WE MUST BE CONCERNED ABOUT DEVELOPING A SKILLED AND COMPETITIVE WORKFORCE HAS EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING SKILLS TO CONTINUE INNOVATING AND LEADING ALL OF OUR WORKFORCE SECTORS FORWARD. AS WE ALL HAVE HEARD THERE'S A SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS THAT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT FROM BIRTH TO AGE FIVE SETS THE FOUNDATION FOR A CHILD'S FUTURE SUCCESS. SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SKILLS IMPULSE CONTROL DECISION MAKING AND MANY OTHER LIFELONG SKILLS BEGIN EARLY. AND RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT HIGH QUALITY EARLY EDUCATION PROGRAMS DO YOU HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT WAS IN THE MOST IMPORTANT. UNDER RESOURCE CHILDREN. LATER IN LIFE THESE SKILLS THAT I JUST MENTIONED DEVELOPING CRITICAL THINKING TEAM PLAYING AND OTHER WORKFORCE COMPETENCY SKILLS. THAT'S WHY HIGH QUALITY CHILD CARE PROGRAMS ARE SO IMPORTANT. WHETHER IT'S ON THE DEMAND SIDE OR THE SUPPLY SIDE HAVING ACCESSIBLE AFFORDABLE AND QUALITY EARLY LEARNING AND CARE IT IS TRULY VITAL PART OF OUR LOCAL AND STATE ECONOMIES NOTHING HAS MADE THAT CLEAR THAN THIS PANDEMIC. LASTLYTHE STABILITY THAT RELIABLE AND CULTURALLY COMPETENT CHILD CARE BRINGS ALLOWS FOR ECONOMIC MOBILITY FOR MANY ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES WE HEARD A TESTIMONY ABOUT THAT EARLIER. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO CLOSE TO TWO POINT FIVE MILLION CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF FOUR THIS REPRESENTS 13% OF OUR NATION'S YOUNG CHILDREN FOR THE FUTURE ECONOMIC SECURITY AND GROWTH OF OUR STATE AND OUR COUNTRY. IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US TO ACTUALLY INVEST IN A ROBUST AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE SYSTEM AND IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS PUT FORTH BY MY COLLEAGUES BEFORE ME. THANK YOU FOR A CHANCE TO TESTIFY AND TO BE PART OF THIS HEARING TODAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IS MEASURED AND NEXT UP- DOCTOR HER BUT- I WILL THANK YOU MUCH FOR- INVITING ME TO GIVE FROM A AT THIS HEARING- I'M OF. PROFESSOR CHAIR THE EARLY STUDIES TECH POLY POMONA. ANAMOSA COACH OF HE WHICH A HIGHER ED BECAUSE TO THAT CAN OF. THE PHARMACIST SIX STATE IN. TO USE TECH. COMMUNITY COLLEGE HI. AND HERE I'M I. SIX I'M FOLLOWING UP MANY OF THE THAT I ALREADY. AND- THE PRE. SPEAKERS TO WHAT IS TIME IMAGE SO. WELL IF NOT PER OF BRAIN STRUCTURE TO GO IN THE FOR FIVE YEARS JAMES HOW HACKMAN HAS CREATED IF HAVE A WALL EARLY TO EXPERIENCE. YOUR ARE THE ACHIEVEMENT CARE ACT GREATLY. THE NEED FOR CHECK IS FOR TO THE CRIME RATE BECAUSE DOWN FOR THOSE CHILDREN WHO HAVE A CAR EARLY EXPERIENCE THEY ARE LIKELY HAVE A LIFESTYLE. MENIKAH POINT OF VIEW EVERYONE DOLLAR YOU PUT IN YOUR WAY HOW TO GET A SEVENTY TWO CHRIS ANNUAL RETURN FOR MONEY SO THE M. AS WELL WHERE IT I ACTUALLY HERE IS THAT- TO HAVE A CALL. EARLY CHILD X. WE NEED CALL A WERE. AND A QUALIFIED WORKFORCE IS A KEY TO BOTH OUR HUMAN AND IT KIND RECOVERY FROM THE- ESTATE POINTED OUT OF THEM PLAN WILL- RELEASED EARLY CHILDHOOD IN THIS CENTER. AND WE'RE WITH THE MASS PLAN AND ONE OF THEM WAS WORKFORCE. WHAT I WANT ARGUES IS ORDER TO HAVE A CALL TO WORK FOR. WE NEED. FIRST OF. FOR TO. UNDER CHILD DEVELOPMENT WE NEED TO UNDER DUAL LANGUAGE. SPECIAL AND HAS BEEN MATCH HERE IS MUCH. TRAUMA AND CARE. AND- WITH WITH I WOULD ALSO TO OUR THAT YOU CAN'T BE A CALL OF WORK UNLESS YOU PAY A CALLER. PRACTICALLY MAKES. AND THAT FOR MANY CENTER. A DEGREE- POSSIBLY A NEW CHILDHOOD. FONG KA AROUND WOULD BE A VERY. GOOD WAY TO SUPPORT- TO. WE ALSO NEED CONTAIN. IN THE- HI MATT PROGRAM. THAT IS A PRO THAT SUPPORTS STUDENTS. NAVIGATING HIGHER END WE ALSO TO ORDER A SCHOOL WITH WOULD HAVE SCHOOLS. THE BURIED PLACE TO GET IT. PRIOR WE NEED TO UP WITH FORGETTABLE INSTEAD SCORELESS. TO GET A BE A- BELIEVE WE GET VERY LITTLE. PAIN BUT- A LOAN THE LOAN SO GET TO GO BE A IS NOT. WE ALSO TO COME WITH FUNDING THAT WAS STUDENTS FOR THEY HAVE TAKE A OFF FOR SO WEEKS OFF- A WEEK TO DO THIS. PRACTICE AND AS THE- THE A MASTER CITY WE NEED TO COME UP A STACK UP. THAT'S THE WAY IT SOME OF THE WAYS TO GET A QUALIFIED WORKFORCE WE HAVE ANOTHER ISSUE ONCE WE GET THIS QUALIFIED WORKFORCE THEY DON'T STAY WHY DON'T THEY SAY IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE EARLY CHILDHOOD WORKERS IN FACT. OUR NEW PROGRAM WHICH STARTED AT CAL POLY IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IS THE FASTEST GROWING PROGRAMMING CAL POLY AND WE HAVE THE HIGHEST GRADUATION RATE. SO WE CAN PREPARE PEOPLE THE PROBLEM IS THEY GET TO BE A- THEY MAKE LIKE A DOLLAR MORE AN HOUR WITH THE VA THAN A NON VA THEY GET A MASTERS THEY GET NO REYES. THEY GO OUT TRY TO WORK IN THE FIELD IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE SO THEY COME BACK THEY GET A CREDENTIAL THEN THEY GO WORK FOR THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM IT'S A WIN FOR THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM WE CANNOT KEEP A SUSTAINABLE WORK FOR US. IF WE DON'T COME UP WITH A EIGHT A LIVABLE WAGE IT'S A MATTER OF FACT IF YOU ARE A PRESCHOOL TEACHER YOU ARE SIX TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE IN POVERTY THAN IF YOU ARE IN THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM. AND IF YOU ARE A PRESCHOOL TEACHER COLOR YOU'RE 50% MORE LIKELY THAN A PRESCHOOL TEACHER A WHITE PRESCHOOL TEACHER TO BE ON HOLIDAY. SO THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE HERE IS ONE WE NEED A QUALIFIED WORKFORCE THIS WORKFORCE NEEDS TO BE WELL TRAINED IN DEVELOPMENT. AND THE SKILLS AND THE KNOWLEDGE TO OFFER QUALITY OUR EARLY CHILDHOOD WE NEED A SUSTAINABLE WAGE AND WE WILL NOT KEEP THAT QUALIFIED WORKFORCE WE ARE NOT A PATHWAY FOR NEW PROFESSION WE ARE HALFWAY. FOR A CREW DAY GOVERNMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO STATE THAT IF WE COULD COME UP WITH- WELL SUSTAIN QUALITY EARLY CHILDHOOD WE WILL BOTH INCREASE. OUR ECONOMIC CAN OUR HUMAN CAPITAL AND THEN FINALLY I WANT TO THANK YOU AND SAY NGUYEN HIGHER ED ARE. VERY WILLING AND EAGER TO WORK ON A- PLANS MAKE THE WORK THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND YOU DR THERE YOU TO ALL OF THE PAN COOPER. AS FAR- AT THIS POINT RECEIVED NOW MOVE TO QUESTIONS INCOME FROM OF THE- BUT BEFORE WE DO I'D LIKE TO INVITE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WISH TO PARTICIPATE TO PLEASE CALL IN NOW PLEASE DIAL THIS TOLL FREE NUMBER. FOUR TWO NINE ONE. SIX THREE SIX FOUR WHEN PROMPTED PLEASE USE THE FOLLOWING ACCESS CODE. THREE AND YOU'LL BE ASSIGNED A PLACE IN THE QUEUE. AND NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. DO ANY OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. JERRY GONZALEZ. YES THANK YOU AND MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR THAT PUTTING TOGETHER THIS WONDERFUL PANEL I CAN ACUMEN- IN THE MIDDLE SO MY APOLOGIES BUT- THANK YOU TO ALL THE PANELISTS AS WELL- YOU ALL HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT OF GREAT WORK IN IN THIS SPACE BUT MY QUESTION I THINK IS SORT OF A LARGER QUESTION AS TO WHAT COULD BE DONE TO WORK- WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY- I KNOW A LOT OF OUR BUSINESSES OBVIOUSLY THEY WANT TO GET BACK. UP AND RUNNING- AND THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEIR WORK FORCE BUT ARE THERE ANY SORT OF CREATIVE PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE BEING DONE OR- THINGS TO KIND OF LOOK AT- ON THE HORIZON. WITH OUR BUSINESS COMMUNITY. THAT'S RIGHT I THINK THAT WOULD BE PROUD TO START A GOOD QUESTION FROM THIS MEASURE. AND MAYBE THAT WOULD BE GREAT. THANKS THAT'S INTERESTING I ACTUALLY THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I ACTUALLY HAD A- REQUEST FOR- COLLEAGUES TO TALK ABOUT THIS EXACT ISSUE THERE THERE IS A STUDYING THIS BEING COMMISSION ON CREATIVE WAYS BUSINESSES ARE INTERESTING- DAY AT CHILD CARE CRISIS- SO I AM HAPPY TO DO SOME FOLLOW UP WITH ALL OF YOUR OFFICES AND SHARED THAT CONTACT INFORMATION. ON THE STUDY WILL BE PARTNERING WITH THEM I'LL JUST GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE OUR AND OUR ONE OF OUR READY NATION MEMBERS HIS CHIEF OF STAFF AT AM JANET COMPANY IN THE BAY AREA. HAS THEN- HAD BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS BEFORE THAT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC HAS REALLY SEEN THEM MASSIVE IMPACT THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING AT HOW HOW DIDTHEY FIND SPACE TO PUT OUR AN ONSITE CHILDCARE CERTAINLY A LOT OF THE TECH COMPANIES IN THE BAY AREA HAVE ONSITE CHILDCARE AND MAKE THAT AVAILABLE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES- BUT THEN ALSO- BECAUSE AMGEN HAS HAD SUCH A HARD TIME FINDING LAND IN THE BAY AREA AS YOU KNOW IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE- IS ALSO THINKING ABOUT- HOW DO THEY PARTNER WITH AN EXISTING PROVIDER TO. OFFER SPACE FOR- FOR THEIR FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THEN LASTLY I KNOW THAT MANY OF US HAVE HEARD ABOUT BUSINESSES THAT PARTNER WITH SPECIFIC TYPES OF PROVIDERS WHO CAN PROVIDE SPECIALTY CARE FOR KIDS WHEN THERE IS AN ILLNESS- OR OTHER SORT OF CHILD CARE EMERGENCY THERE HAVE BEEN BUSINESSES THAT- THAT DO THAT KIND OF WORK. AND AS THEIR AS THEIR JOBS SO THAT JUST A FEW- A FEW WAYS AND AS I SAID I WILL FOLLOW UP AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE ALL CONNECTED AND GET THE INFORMATION AS THIS STUDY INVOLVES. THANK YOU FOR THAT I'VE OBTAINED MISDIRECTION I'M. GUESSING YOU MAY HAVE SOME COMMENTS AS WELL. SHE THANK YOU FOR. THE QUESTION THINK YOU MEMBERS FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON PAGE LEAVE- OBVIOUSLY RELATES. TO THIS IS THE SAME ALL TOPIC AS WE NEED TO SUPPORT. OUR OUR NEW PARENTS- AND- THIS IS A TIME WHEN SUPPORTING OR NEW PARENTS THEN IT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT. BECAUSE IT ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE NEEDS FOR TAKING CARE OF INTENSE FROM ZERO TO SIX MONTHS OLD IF OUR IF OUR A NEW PARENTS GET TO STAY AND GET COMPENSATED FOR THAT TIME- SO I JUST RESET YOUR LEADERSHIP ONE'S GOING FORWARD. I THINK THAT OBVIOUSLY IS ONE THING IT'S RELATED TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITIES WE NEED TO BUSINESS COMMITTEE TO EMBRACE AND SUPPORT NEW PARENTS. AND KNOW ABOUT THE- CERTAIN THE INCREASING POLICIES WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA FOR A LONGER PERIOD AND FOR PROTECTED LEAVE FOR SMALLER EMPLOYERS. TO YOUR LARGER QUESTION I THINK THERE'S TWO THINGS A BUSINESS CAN YOU COME TO MIND IF THEY COME TO MY FOR ME THAT THEY CAN DO ONE IS JUST. THIS KIND OF WORK WE'RE DOING WITH TODAY'S HEARING IS BUILDING AWARENESS OF THE BUSINESS TREATY OF WHY THEY NEED TO SUPPORT PUBLIC INVESTMENTS IN EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION. SO THAT YOU'RE ACCOMPLISHING WE NEED TO KEEP DOING THAT EVEN BOLDER AND BETTER ALL OF US. AND THAT'S WHY WE ISSUED OUR BEACON ECONOMICS REPORT TO TRY TO USE BUSINESS SPEAK FOR AN ECONOMISTS SAY YOU HAVE EVEN MORE STAKE IN THIS THAN YOU REALIZE. THE SECOND THING IS THE BUSINESS COMMITTEE S. IS GOOD AT REBUILDING BUSINESSES THAT IS THEIR EXPERTISE THAT'S THEIR GREATEST EXPERTISE. WE SHOULD ENGAGE MORE OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY I USE OVER DC EVENTUALLY CAPITALIST. AS BEING MENTORS IN SUPPORT- SOME OF OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS THAT ARE REALLY GOOD AT TAKING CARE OF OUR CHILDREN BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TRAINING IN HOW TO OPERATE A BUSINESS IN SOME CASES MANY DO BY THE WAY BUT- AND SO I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE MORE ROBUST SORT OF INVESTMENT AND- IN BUILDING UP THE KIND OF REST OF FOUR OF BUSINESS LEADERS. THAT CAN PROVIDE MENTORING AND SUPPORT TO OUR CHILD CARE. SECTOR ON HOW TO READ BUILDING- THAT'S WHAT REST ARE GOING TO BE TO DO NOW. IN WE REALLY SHOULD THINK ABOUT IT LIKE WE ARE SO CONCERNED WITH OUR RESTAURANTS AND TRAVEL AND TOURISM. AND THAT IS HOW DO WE HELP THESE BUSINESSES REBUILD THEMSELVES. I APPRECIATE THAT ARE THERE ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS. OF PANELISTS WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK THIS QUESTION IT IS A GOOD QUESTION- AND IF YOU WOULD MY MISTER MERRICK. I THINK YOU LIVE IN THAT SPACE SO- IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO THIS JUST A LITTLE BIT. YES MY NAME JUST BY WAY OF BACKGROUND- MY COMPANY PARTNERS WITH EMPLOYERS TO DEVELOP ON SITE- PRESCHOOLS FOR THE BENEFIT OF- EMPLOYEES CHILDREN- AND- TO THE OTHER SPEAKERS POINT. YOU KNOW THAT IS A BENEFIT THAT. ONLY A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF EMPLOYERS CAN PROVIDE- GIVEN THE RESOURCES REQUIRED SPACE CONSTRAINTS THINGS ABOUT THAT NATURE- BUT I THINK THAT ARE SORT OF KIND OF MELD. THE TWO PREVIOUS COMMENTATORS POINTS I THINK ONE OF WONDER. PARTICULARLY INTERESTING WAY THAT CHILD CARE CENTERS CAN REBUILD THEIR BUSINESS SAYS IS BY PARTNERING WITH EMPLOYERS LIKE AMGEN WHO IS LOOKING FOR A BENEFIT FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES BUT BECAUSE OF SPACE CONSTRAINTS CAN'T. DO THAT RIGHT AWAY BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT EXISTING CHILD CARE OPERATORS HAVE- ADDITIONAL UNUSED CAPACITY YOU CAN BASICALLY CREATE A CLEARING HOUSE ALSO THAT THESE- BUSINESSES. CAN HELP THEIR EMPLOYEES MEET THEIR CHILD CARE NEEDS AND ALSO GIVE ALL A STEP A LEG UP THE CHILD CARE OPERATORS WHO WANT TO FILL THEIR CLASSROOMS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ANY OTHER PANEL SHOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO US SENATE INTELLIGENCE QUESTION I. I'D LIKE TO ADD JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS I'M EIGHT I APPRECIATE THAT THE ENGAGEMENT OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND I THINK ONE OF THE- BIGGEST LESSONS OF THE PANDEMIC IS HOW CRITICAL CHILD IS THE CHILD CARE IS TO OUR ECONOMY. AND I THINK HOW WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AS AN UNDERSTANDING THAT CHILD CARE IS AS IMPORTANT TO GETTING YOUR EMPLOYEES TO WORK AS ROADS- IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND MAKING SURE THEY'RE AT THE TABLE AND I WANT TO ECHO. DAVID RAT RACE COME COMMENTS ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THE NEED FOR PUBLIC INVESTMENT I THINK THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT ARE IN A POSITION TO DO SOME SUPPORT FOR THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES BUT LARGELY WE NEED A BROADER. ROBUST SYSTEM THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF OUR TWENTY FOUR SEVEN ICONOMI AND HAS OPTIONS FOR FAMILIES WHO WORK IN ALL TYPES OF INDUSTRIES AND CAN BE FLEXIBLE AND RESPONSIVE TO THEIR WORK SCHEDULES AND PROVIDE A QUALITY CARING. ENVIRONMENT FOR THEIR YOUNG KIDS. THANK YOU. I MEAN I COULD JUMP ADEQUATE COMMENT I'M JUST TO PIGGY BACK ON WHAT DONNA AND SOME OF THE OTHER PANELISTS WERE MENTIONING I THINK ANOTHER WAY FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO GET ENGAGED DESPITE WEIGHING IN ON THE POLICY DISCUSSION AND WE'VE CERTAINLY SEEN THAT WITH SOME OF OUR BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS IN LOS ANGELES WITH VALLEY INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE ASSOCIATION WITH THE L. A. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND I REMEMBER WELL SITUATION LAST YEAR WHEN- THERE WAS A PROPOSAL ON THE TABLE TO ADD TO LOWER THE ALREADY LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS SO WE HEARD THAT. THERE WAS AN INTEREST FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN HEARING FROM UNTRADITIONAL PARTNERS ON THIS TOPIC NOT FROM THE USUAL SUSPECTS AND SO THEY WERE NUMBER BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS WHO STEPPED UP- BIKE IT WAS ONE OF THEM I THINK CANCEL FOR A STRONG AMERICA- WITH THEIR BUSINESS MEMBERS WAS ONE AND MADE THE CASE THAT REIMBURSEMENT RATE SHOULD SHOULD NOT BE LOWERED AND THAT MADE AN IMPACT SO I THINK- YOU KNOW IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE PARTICULARLY IN IN MATTERS OF LEGISLATION IN THE BUDGET PROCESS WHEN BUSINESS LEADERS CAN STEP UP. ALONGSIDE CHILDCARE. PROVIDERS- IT'S VERY POWERFUL. WELL SIR AND ANY OTHER PALACE I MOVE ON. THANK YOU SO SENATOR LAMAR HAS A CO PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU CHAIR- AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS THEY THINK IS THE ONE WHO'S BEEN WORKING ON SOME CHILD CARE ISSUES FOR YOU KNOW A FEW YEARS WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN WE NEVER HAD ENOUGH SPOT WHEN IT WAS SUBSIDIZE OUR UNSUBSIDIZED. SO THE PANDEMIC HAS JUST- MEET THIS CHALLENGE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER- FOR OUR STATE AND- I KNOW THERE'S A FEW LESS THAT ARE WORKING ON LEGISLATION TRYING TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS. BUT IT STILL CREATES THIS ISSUE AND- WE YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH CERTAINLY THE GUIDELINES AROUND PANDEMICS. I HAVE BEEN VERY CAUTIOUS AND WE'VE HEARD A LOT FROM CHILD CARE PROVIDERS- WHETHER IT'S CENTERS OR HOME CARE THAT- YOU KNOW THEY'VE HAD TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SPOTS BECAUSE OF THE GUIDELINES AT. AND IS THE MATH ISN'T WORKING OUT THE WITH THE WAY THAT- IT WOULD NEED TO IN ORDER TO KEEP SOME OF THESE FACILITIES ALIVE AND SO- I HEARD A FEW SUGGESTIONS THAT WERE MADE IN TERMS OF POLICY THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN FACE COULD. ADDRESS WHICH OF COURSE INCLUDES RATE REFORM BETWEEN WE'VE BEEN OUT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS I KNOW CENTER LABELS- CONTINUES TO LEAD THAT THAT CONVERSATION- BUT YOU KNOW AT THE IN LIGHT OF. THE FACT THAT CHILD CARE COULD LOOK DIFFERENT AND WE HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE MEANING. OF THE PARTNERING THE BUSINESS WHAT OTHER LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS THAT COULD THE LEGISLATURE THINK OF IN TERMS OF REMATCH ANNIE WHAT CHILD CARE LOOKS LIKE- IN IN CERTAINLY THAT- IT IS SOMETHING THAT. THE LEGISLATURE I THINK WOULD BE INTERESTED IN. THANK YOU IT WOULD ANY PANELIST TO RESPOND. SURE I HATE THIS IS THOMAS NARINDER WITH CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER I THANK YOU SENATOR LIMóN FOR YOUR ADVOCACY OVER THE YEARS AND I KNOW YOU KNOW CHILD CARE ISSUES IN A DIFFERENT WAY NOW THAN YOU DID A COUPLE YEARS AGO. WE ARE I'M ACTIVELY WORKING ON THE EFFORTS RELATED TO REIMBURSEMENT RATE REFORM WHICH IS REALLY FOUNDATIONAL TO BEING ABLE TO SUSTAIN AND BRING NEW PEOPLE INTO THE WORK FORCE- SO IWOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T PUT THAT FIRST AND FOREMOST ON OUR LIST I THINK OTHER THINGS WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT IS. MAKING THE CHILD CARE SYSTEM MORE FLEXIBLE FOR FAMILIES MAKING IT MORE ACCESSIBLE BY REFORMING AND RE RETHINKING THE NEED FOR FAMILY FEES- EXPANDING ACCESS TO NONTRADITIONAL TYPES OF PROVIDERS UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE HOURS OF THE DAY AND DAYS OF THE WEEK THAT AREN'T. REALLY PROVIDED IN A TRADITIONAL BRICK AND MORTAR FACILITY AND I THINK OPPORTUNITIES TO REALLY BUILD OUR WORK FORCE I WE'VE BEEN WORKING LOCALLY ON APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS TRYING TO BRING PEOPLE INTO THE FIELD AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS IS HOW MUCH WE PAY. ON THERE IT'S NOT THAT PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IT'S THAT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PAY A COMPETITIVE WAGE TO BRING NEW PEOPLE TO THE TABLE- IS SOME OF THAT- COULD IT COULD BE- PARTNERED WITH BUSINESS I KNOW WE'RE DOING A LOT OF WORK PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND LOOKING AT HOW TO STRENGTHEN OUR WORKFORCE AND BRING PEOPLE TO THE TABLE IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND LASTLY I'D I THINK THAT CONTINUING TO SUPPORT OUR MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM SO THAT PARENTS HAVE TRUE CHOICE FOR THEIR CHILDREN BIRTH THROUGH SCHOOL AGE. IN PROGRAMS THAT MEET THEIR NEEDS- AND I KNOW WE TALK A LOT ABOUT LITTLE KIDS BUT OUR AFTER SCHOOL SYSTEM NEEDS AND TENSION AS WELL- KERR. ARE ASUS PROGRAMS ARE NOT OPEN DURING THE SUMMER AND ON SCHOOL HOLIDAYS IT MAKES SOME NOT VERY HELPFUL SO HOW DO WE START TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE CHILD CARE SYSTEM. THAT IS AVAILABLE TO FAMILIES THROUGHOUT THAT DURATION AND ALWAYS HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT SPECIFICS. CLEARLY SO THANK YOU CENTER THE MONNING HAS ANOTHER QUESTION PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU CARE AND YOU KNOW MY OTHER QUESTION IS A SOMETIMES SOME OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES- WE SEE DISPARITIES REGIONAL. REGIONAL DISPARITIES AND SO I'M WONDERING IF ANYONE CAN SPEAK TO PERHAPS ANY REGIONAL DISPARITIES THAT WE MAY BE SEEN WHETHER IT'S A PARTNERSHIP WITH BUSINESSES WE A LOT OF COMMON RIGHT A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE BAY AREA AREA. BUT WHAT WHAT WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT OTHER REGIONS OF THE STATE THAT SURELY STILL HAVE CHILD CARE NEEDS- BUT WHERE THE OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTNER WITH BUSINESS MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. ANY PALACE PLEASE FEEL FREE. THIS IS DAVID RATTRAY- I MEAN I JUST SAY THE OBVIOUS THING THANK YOU AGAIN SENATOR FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS SPACE- THE OBVIOUS THING IS WE SEE THE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN RESEARCH HISTORICALLY EVEN MORE IN DISTRESS NOW SO THERE'S GOING TO BE- ARE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR OUR LOWEST INCOME COMMUNITIES. WHERE WE HAVE THE LOWEST WEALTH. AND WE HAVE THE LEAST CAPITAL INVESTMENT AT LEAST PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYMENT LIKE YOU JUST SAID- WE HAVE THE MOST STRESS. SO NO SURPRISE THERE BUT IT SHOULD BE A WAKE UP CALL AND WANT TO GO BACK TO THIS POSSIBLY- HUGE INVESTMENT BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- WE SHOULD DISPROPORTIONATELY MAKE THOSE MONIES AVAILABLE TO OUR-LOWEST INCOME COMMUNITIES AND OUR PROVIDERS IN THOSE LOWEST INCOME COMMUNITIES. AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT EASY BECAUSE OUR MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES NEED RESOURCES TO. BUT NOWHERE NEAR THE SAME PROPORTIONALITY IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE SO I THINK IT'S GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO- TO DISPROPORTIONATELY ALLOCATE THOSE FEDERAL ONE TIME RESOURCES TO REBUILDING AND SUPPORTING THE SECTOR. IN THE LOWEST INCOME COMMUNITIES AND MOSTLY THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR THAT. CHAIR AT FIVE AGENCIES. THANK YOU ITS FIRST I WANT TO SIT BACK AND- WITH DAVID JUST SAID AND THEN I JUST WANT TO ADD- WERE ACTUALLY WORKING ON ANOTHER REPORT AND WE DID A NATIONAL REPORT ON THE IMPACT OF LACK OF ACCESS TO CHILDCARE RURAL COMMUNITIES AND HOW IT'S FURTHER DEVASTATING RURAL COMMUNITIES BECAUSE FAMILIES CANNOT STAY. THEY CAN'T TAKE JOBS IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND BECAUSE THERE IS NO CHILD CARE AVAILABLE AND SO I THINK YOUR POINT IS EXACTLY THE RIGHT ONE- DIETS WE HAVE TO INVEST IN THE AREAS- AND- I'VE URBAN AREAS WHERE COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN UNDERSERVED SYSTEMATICALLY BUT ALSO IN RURAL AREAS SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES AND MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR FAMILIES. GROWING UP THERE TO CONTINUE TO STAND RAISE THEIR CHILDREN THEIR- I APPRECIATE WHAT WE WILL LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING THAT REPORT. THAT ANY OTHER COMMENTS IN RESPONSE FROM PANELISTS. I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A QUICK COMMENT I THINK I THINK WE ARE LOOKING AT THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS GREAT BUT I THINK WE SHOULD ALSO THINK ABOUT HOW CAN WE EXPAND TO OTHER PUBLIC AGENCIES PROBABLY FORM COLLABORATIONS INSTEAD OF. YOU KNOW HIGHER IT BEING ISOLATED THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY BEING ISOLATED HARTLEY FARM HUMIDITY PARTNERSHIPS- I'VE WORKED BOTH IN WORLD CALIFORNIA IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND NOW IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VERY DIFFERENT NEEDS IN THE TWO AREAS AND TO COME UP WITH ONE SYSTEM FOR. SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY VERSUS HUMBOLDT COUNTY THEY'RE THEY'RE DIFFERENT AND HOW DO WE GET THE COMMUNITY PARTNERS HIGHER ED BUSINESS. ON PROVIDERS WORK TO. THAT'S I WOULD SAY. ALSO JUST ADDED A AND ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE HAVEN'T TOUCHED ON IS THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FACILITIES- YOU KNOW IN THE LAST BUDGET THERE WAS AS A BLOCK GRANT DEVOTED PARTICULARLY AND SPECIFICALLY FOR FACILITIES THAT WAS SLAPPED AND WE KNOW THAT THEIR CHILD CARE DESERTS NOT JUST IN TERMS AND LACK OF SUBSIDIZED DOLLARS FOR SPACES BUT FOR THE FACILITIES THEMSELVES. AND SO I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER AREA AND INVESTMENT THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN NOT ONLY RE OPENING GRANTS FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS BUT BUT OPENING GRANTS AND RETROFITTING- FACILITIES PARTICULARLY TO SORT OF INFANTS AND INFANTS AND TODDLERS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT'S WHERE THE GREATEST NEED IS- INTO DAVID'S POINT TO I THINK TECH IS TAKING AN EQUITY FOCUSED APPROACH TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF FEDERAL AND STATE DOLLARS IS REALLY CRITICAL. IN APPRECIATE THAT AB ANY REMAINING COMMENTS FROM THE PALACE BEFORE I MOVE ON TO NEXT QUESTION. SEEING NONE THANK YOU- ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTION FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE.

AND THE MANY PARENTS WHO MIGHT HAVE CHILD CARE RIGHT NOW WELL IMMEDIATE RELIEF IS ESSENTIAL TO THE CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE ADMINISTERED CHILD CARE PROGRAM WE ALSO URGE RELIEF FOR THE PROVIDER WHO DO NOT OR CANNOT PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE STATE CHILD CARE PROGRAM. THESE PROVIDERS EARN VERY LOW WAGES AND ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY BLACK AND BROWN WOMEN. WHILE THEY ARE SUPPORT OTHER BUSINESSES BY PROVIDING CARE FOR EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES CHILDREN THEY ARE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. THOUSAND HAVE ALREADY CLOSED AND MANY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RE OPEN WITHOUT CASH RELIEF. WE ARE KEEPING OUR CHILDREN SAFE AND HEALTHY AT THE TIME AND ENSURING THAT PARETS CAN WORK. WE ALSO URGE THE IMMEDIATE ACTION MUST INCLUDE IMMEDIATE RELIEF FOR FAMILY FEE FOR ALL FAMILIES MANY OF WHOM ARE ALSO BLACK AND BROWN MOTHER. WHO HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS PER MONTH AND FAMILY B. WE ASK THAT AWAY VERY B. E.

THEN IF THERE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS I WILL CLOSE- AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING REMARKS THE GOAL OF TODAY'S HEARING WAS TO EXAMINE SOME OF THESE ISSUES RELATED CHILD CARE IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY IN THE SCOPE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE PANDEMIC ACROSS A WIDE VARIETY PERSPECTIVES FROM EXPERTS AND PARTICIPANTS IN THE FIELD AS WE'VE HEARD AS THE BIG CAN'T PANDEMIC PROGRESS MANY CHILDCARE PROVIDERS FOUND THEMSELVES CONFUSED- INDEED WHIPSAWED BY THE FLOW OF AMBIGUOUS AND SOMETIMES CONTRADICTORY GUIDANCE AND CONSTANTLY CHANGING REQUIREMENTS EMANATING FROM THE STATE BRINGING A SEEMINGLY NEVER ENDING ENDING. A STRING OF NEW RULES AND REGULATIONS. OPERATIONS IN THE CHILDREN IN THEIR CARE. AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY MANY OF THE MANY IF NOT MOST OF THE ISSUES RAISED HERE THIS MORNING BECAUSE CHALLENGES TO THE CHILD CARE SECTOR. WELL BEFORE THE PANDEMIC OF THE BEEN DEMOCRATS ONLY SERVE TO EXPOSE THESE ISSUES FURTHER. AS WE MOVE TOWARD THE RE OPENING OF K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS IN THE RECOVERY OF THE ECONOMY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WORKING PARENTS WILL NEED TO RELY ON EXPANDED CAPACITY CHUKKER PROVIDERSNOW MORE THAN EVER IN THE WORDS OF JULIA MORE A CHILD CARE OPERATOR AND THIS MORNING'S FIRST PANEL PARTICIPANT. CHILD CARE IS THE BACKBONE OF THE ECONOMY IT'S THE WORK THAT MAKES OTHER WORK POSSIBLE. TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY- IN THE VERY ELEGANT WORDS OF DYNASTY RICHARD CHILD CARE IS IMPORTANT TO GETTING TO WORK AS ROACH. AS A COROLLARY BENEFIT IF WE WERE REALLY. WILLING AND ABLE TO INVEST IN CHILDCARE CALIFORNIA- AS MISTER ROGERS IN THIS MAJOR POINT ON THEIR TESTIMONY WE WOULD UNLOCK UNTOLD BENEFITS FOR CALIFORNIA ALONG THE WAY JUST AS IMPORTANTLY. IMPROVING CHILD CARE IN CALIFORNIA AND MAKING IT MORE EQUITABLE AND AFFORDABLE IS A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY AS WELL. THE DOCTOR LET'S COMMENT EARLIER IN A STATE AS VAST AND COMPLEX IS CALIFORNIA. ONE SIZE CLEARLY DOES NOT FIT ALL. ONE OF MY GOALS AS CHAIR OF THE SENATE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON PANDEMIC EMERGING RESPONSES TO ENSURE TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE.
