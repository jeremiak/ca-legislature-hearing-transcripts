SUPPORTING THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMERS WHO ARE ALSO DEATH IS AN AREA IN WHICH WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON ON A MORE TARGETED BASIS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS- SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE'VE IMPLEMENTED WAS REALLY LISTENING TO THE COMMUNITY HAVING SOME FOCUSED. DISCUSSION WITH THE SELF ADVOCATES FAMILY MEMBERS. ALSO REGIONAL CENTERS HEARING WHAT THE CHALLENGES WERE IN- PROVIDING SERVICES AND I'D LIKE TO JUST REMIND THE COMMITTEE- ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE'VE BEEN REALLY FOCUSED ON. OVER GOSH CERTAINLY OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS- A BIT BEFORE BUT CONCENTRATED EFFORT IN THE MOST RECENT YEARS ON SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT ACCESSING SERVICES AT THE REGIONAL CENTER THE SAME AS OTHERS THAT ARE FULLY ACCESSING PRIMARILY- WITHIN OUR WHITE COMMUNITY- WE HAVE FOUND THROUGH OUR WORK THERE'S BEEN SOME REAL UNIQUE. NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN VARIOUS COMMUNITIES AND WE'VE REALLY LEARNED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE SENSITIVITY WITHIN CULTURAL LINGUISTIC SENSITIVITY AND THAT'S CERTAINLY APPLIES TO OUR DEAF COMMUNITY AS WELL- BUT WHILE WE'VE TAKEN A- IN APPROACH TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES- TO INCLUDE ASSURING THAT REPRESENTATION WITHIN OUR DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TASK FORCE- WHICH IS A TASK FORCE THAT HAS- STAKEHOLDERS. THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE DEPARTMENT IN HEARING FROM THE COMMUNITY- ON INPUT ON POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED OR IDENTIFY VARIOUS WITHIN OUR SERVICES- WE FOUND THAT THERE ARE- NEEDS TO BE SOME INCREASED EFFORTS AND FOCUS. IN ASSURING THAT WERE INTERESTING BUT THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF OUR OUR INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE REGIONAL CENTERS- WHO ARE ALSO DEATH. SO MR WINFIELD IS GOING TO WALK YOU THROUGH THE PROPOSAL I'M TODAY SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER BUT BUILT. GOOD MORNING MADAM. IN OF THE CAN. TO BUILD ON WHAT DIRECTOR MARGIN AND HAS TALKED ABOUT AND ADDRESS AND SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY ISSUES WITHIN OUR SYSTEM- THIS PROPOSAL UNIQUE SEEKS TO MEET THE INDIVIDUALS ARE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE WHO ARE GAS AND THEIR UNIQUE CULTURAL NEEDS- BEING DEAF IS NOT A QUALIFYING DIAGNOSIS REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES BUT CERTAIN REGIONAL CENTERS TO. SERVE INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY OR ALSO GAS. SOME OF THE OVER ARCHING CONCERNS FOR MEETINGS WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND ADVOCATES HAVE BEEN- HAVING ACCESS TO EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION ACROSS DIFFERENT SERVICE CATEGORIES. THAT ESPECIALLY IN RESIDENTIAL IN CASE SERVICE SINCE- THE LACK OF FORMAL COMMUNICATION ASSESSMENTS WHEN A DEATH INDIVIDUALS AND TO THE SYSTEM SO THAT THOSE SERVICES THAT ARE DEVELOPED AS A PART OF THE INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM PLANS CAN BE PROVIDED IN A VERY PERSON CENTRED WAY AND INDIVIDUALS HAVE RIGHTS TO EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION. AND ALSO THE NEED FOR GDS TO PROVIDE THAT STATEWIDE LEADERSHIP TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO ACCESSING APPROPRIATE SERVICES SO THIS PROPOSAL- SIX NINETY FOUR TWENTY TWO POSITIONS- ONE STATEWIDE COORDINATOR AND GDS- TO PROVIDE THAT SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE. LEADERSHIP AND THE STATEWIDE COORDINATION AND THEN TWENTY ONE- MUTUAL CENTER POSITIONS WHO WOULD WORK AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH THE SERVICE BUT NATION STAFF WITHIN THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO- WORK ON TEACHING THE KITCHEN ASSESSMENTS TO.

THAT THIS PROVIDES FOR PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY IF WE CAN HELP EVERYBODY BE ABLE TO RISE TO THEIR FULL POTENTIAL AND BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO NEEDED SERVICES SO WE THINK THAT APARTMENT FOR BRINGING THE FIRST FORWARD- AND NOW WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO. AB WITH JOE. I HAVE YEARS OF HAVING. A HOW DO YOU SAY IT DIRECTOR. EXAM HERE THANK YOU OKAY WELCOME. SO FIRST OF ALL- GREETINGS TO YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- JOKES IF YOU'RE DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION I'M ALSO JOINED TODAY BY OUR CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND THE MAGIC THAT YOU WILL HEAR FROM- AND THE SECOND. WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO THIS ITEM AND TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THAT YOU HAVE. THE GOVERNOR'S COMEBACK PLAN. INCLUDES THIS ITEM WHICH IS REALLY FOCUSED ON EMPLOYMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. AND REALLY ALSO INTERVENES ARE ADDRESSES THE INEQUITIES- THAT PEOPLE HAVE- AND SO WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE TO ADDRESS THIS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD WANT TO KNOW RIGHT UP FRONT. IS HOW EMPLOYMENT IS SUCH A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE HEALTH THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY AS WELL AS A PATH OUT OF POVERTY FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE. WE REALLY SEEK TO ADDRESS ADDRESS TWO AREAS OF THIS ONE IS FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES WHO LOST THEIR JOBS AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC AND TWO MORE WIDELY. FOCUSED ON INCREASING EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THIS FROM THE CONSUMER'S LANDS THE INDIVIDUALS LANDS. IT'S I CAN'T GET THROUGH THE SCREENING- I DON'T GET AN INTERVIEW OR I DON'T GET THE JOB AND SO WHAT REALLY WHAT WE ARE DOING- I'M HERE IN ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I WAS ASKED TO SPEAK TO IS WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS APPROACH WE ARE REALLY GETTING AT. THE INDIVIDUALS THAT MAKE OF THE HIGHER AND HELPING TO CHANGE THAT MINDSET FROM THE DEMAND SIDE OF THE EMPLOYMENT OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. THE PARADIGM IS REALLY SHIFTING HOW BUSINESS LOOKS AT HIRING INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES FROM IT'S A GOOD THING TO DO IT'S A TERRIBLE THING TO DO. TO THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT COLLECTIVELY WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND FRIENDS HAVE A LARGE MARKET PLACE- AT PURCHASING POWER. AND THAT REPRESENTATION IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. PROVIDES ACCESS TO THAT MARKET BY THE BUSINESS. SO AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS REALLY TO TRANSFORM THAT MIND SET FROM A TRANSACTIONAL ENGAGEMENT WITH BUSINESS TO REALLY SHIFTING THEIR ATTITUDES ON HOW WE ENGAGE HOW DO WE ADDRESS THIS- WONDER WHAT THE WAY THAT WE LOOK AT- IS TO INITIATE. A MARKETING- START A TARGET MARKETING CAMPAIGN BUT I'M GOING TO STOP HERE AND TURN THIS OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE AND NEED TO SPEAK TO THE DETAILS ABOUT AS WELL AS THE INCENTIVES ON. THANK YOU WELCOME CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR. THANK YOU IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE THIS MORNING SO- AS DIRECTOR YOU SAVE YOUR MENTIONED THERE ARE THERE ARE ACTUALLY THREE PARTS TO THE PROPOSAL THE FIRST YEAR- ALL SPEAK TEAR AND THEN ON THE THIRD PART IS LED BY OUR PARTNERS AT TDS SO- THE FIRST TWO PIECES ARE A MEDIA CAMPAIGN. AND THEN INCENTIVES FOR EMPLOYERS TO HIRE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES SO FOR THE MEDIA CAMPAIGN- WE ARE SEEKING TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND. TO SUPPORT- THREE SUBCOMPONENTS SO- THE FIRST YEAR IS USING THE STATE'S CONVENING POWER- TO BRING- EMPLOYERS TOGETHER AND TO COMMIT TO YOU OFFERING INTERNSHIPS WORK EXPERIENCES AND TO HIRE. INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES- ONE ONE MOM UP THE- IS THAT- FIRST. EQUAL PAY PLAN ON WHICH SHE- I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND IT'S REALLY A CHALLENGETO EMPLOYERS TO COMMIT TO INCREASING GENDER DIVERSITY IN THE WORKFORCE AND- THAT THAT- THAT. CANTEEN HAS PROVEN TO BE SUCCESSFUL WITH- CURRENTLY FIFTY MAJOR EMPLOYERS- COMMITTING TO THAT LANDS ON THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THE MEDIA CAMPAIGN IS. RANT TOLAR STATUE CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE OR TRADE ORGANIZATIONS- FOR THEM TO ESTABLISH A BUSINESS CHAMPIONS CAMPAIGN TO FORMALLY RECOGNIZE- EMPLOYERS WHO ARE LEADERS IN THE PROVISION OF INTERNSHIPS WORK EXPERIENCES AND HIRING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES- WITH WITH- THE GRANT- ONE OF THE CONDITIONS WE ANTICIPATE- PLACING ON THE GRANT DOLLARS IS ON. ESTABLISHING PUBLICIZING AN ONLINE LIST OF INCLUSIVE EMPLOYERS INTERNET ON DIRECTOR OF SENIOR MENTIONED- THIS REALLY IS TEARS SHIP THE PARADIGM FROM- YOU KNOW KIND OF PICTURE AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT MODEL- REQUESTING EMPLOYERS TO HIRE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES TO REALIZING THAT- THERE IS SIGNIFICANT BUYING POWER IN THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY AND SO WHEN PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. SEE A LIST OF INCLUSIVE EMPLOYERS- THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO FREQUENT THOSE BUSINESSES THAT APPEAR ON THOSE. LISTS- AND THEN THE THIRD PARTY THE MEDIA IS A PUBLIC IN. FOR MISSION CAMPAIGN ARM THROUGH TRADITIONAL AND SOCIAL MEDIA. TOUTING THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF HIRING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AS AS PART OF EFFORTS TO. CREATE AND MAINTAIN A DIVERSE WORKFORCE. THIS SECOND COMPONENT- THE- BECAUSE EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TO A DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION TO ESTABLISH EMPLOYER INCENTIVES TO HIRE AND HERE. IN TRAIN PEOPLE WITH INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES- AND THEY'RE ALSO THREE COMPONENTS JIM THIS IS. HE'S THE FIRST IS PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND FUNDING- PRIMARILY TO SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED EMPLOYERS. TO MAKE THEIR WORKPLACES ACCESSIBLE AND- AND AGAIN THERE WOULD BE ON THERE WOULD BE REQUIREMENTS ATTACHED TO THE GRANT DOLLARS FOR THOSE EMPLOYERS TO SET HIRING GOALS- THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THE EMPLOYER INCENTIVES- WOULD BE A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SOCIETY FOR HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO CREATE TRAINING- ON STRATEGIES FOR EMPLOYERS TO RECRUIT SCREEN HIGHER INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES AND THEN THE THIRD COMPONENT OF THE EMPIRE- INCENTIVE. WHICH. FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES ARE PLACED. AT WORKPLACE OUT LEARNING IN AN EXPERIENCE THAT WOULD THEN TO. EMPLOYMENT AND- FOR THAT FOR THE- THESE TWO PROPOSALS. WE'VE WAITED HIGHER ONE LIMITED TERM- STAFF MEMBER TO- TO OVERSEE THAT THE PROGRESS THAT PROJECT- I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE SAID DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TO TALK. ABOUT THAT THIRD COMPONENT. THANK YOU THIS IS NANCY BARGE MEN I DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND I AM- JOINED- AGAIN BY CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR BRIAN WINDSHIELD IS WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS SHOULDN'T NEED PRESENTS AND THEN WILL LATER IN THE AGENDA BE PRESENTING ON OUR PROPOSALS RELATED TO. COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT AND PERFECT AND THE- IF THE PARTICIPANTS OR THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE FOR INDIVIDUALS. SO REALLY REALLY PLEASED TO PARTNER WITH DEPARTMENT OF REHAB AND WHILE WE'VE HAD IT AND OF LONG HISTORY OF PARTNERSHIP WITH. WITH OUR COLLEAGUES OVER AT DEPARTMENT OF REHAB THIS IS REALLY A VERY TARGETED. COLLABORATION THAT- I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT- AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY WITHIN DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES- OF OUR PROPOSED USE OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS AS PART OF THIS APPROACH- OUR EFFORTS REALLY ARE. GEARED TOWARDS EXPANDING OUR CURRENT APPROACH TO INCREASING COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT AND THEN ALSO WITH ARE PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS THAT AS A PATHWAY- TO ACHIEVE INCREASED OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS. BUT WHAT ONE OF THE AREAS THAT- I A COLLEGE EYES I'M GOING TO BE REPEATING A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT OUR COLLEAGUES SHARED BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ALSO EMPHASIZED THE COMMITMENT- CHIU CREATING THESE OPPORTUNITIES BUT ALSO REALLY CREATING A SHIFT IN THINKING. AND REALLY TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD- NOT ONLY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY OF OURSELF AVOCATS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO WORK THEY'VE EXPRESSED THE BONTA WORK WE'VE HEARD THAT THEY WANT TO WORK THEY WANT OPPORTUNITIES. AND I'VE PERSONALLY SEEN- HOW BE DEDICATION THAT- ARE SELF ADVOCATES HAVE MADE TO BE JUST PHENOMENAL EMPLOYEES AND QUITE HONESTLY I WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY TEND TO BE THE MOST RELIABLE- INDIVIDUALS THAT THAT YOU'LL MEET BECAUSE OF MUCH OF THEIR PASSION- BUT WE ALSO NEED TO HELP SHIFT THE THINKING OF THOSE WHO WOULD HIRE THEM. YOU KNOW SEEING THE VALUE OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES BRING ON TO AN ORGANIZATION- AND- AND PART OF THE WORK FORCE SO THIS IS REALLY I'M BUILDING UPON OUR EXISTING EFFORTS. ON TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE- PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE CONNECTIONS- SO IN IN ADDITION TO SUPPORTING THE WORK THAT DEPARTMENT EDGE- REHAB IS PRESENTING- WE REALLY DO SEE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A VERY TARGETED GRANTS. THAT WOULD BE EARMARKED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WOULD BE- WITH- THE SMALL FOR EXAMPLE SMALL BUSINESS. ASSOCIATIONS AND SMALL BUSINESSES AS- IN A THAT THERE IS A LOCAL. BETWEEN CENTERS PROVIDERS AS WELL AS A SMALL BUSINESSES ENGAGING WITH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE I'M SO WE CAN REALLY ENHANCE THAT PATHWAY- WE SEE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD UPON SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN. DONE BASED ON CUSTOMIZED IN EMPLOYMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS ASSURING THAT THERE'S INDIVIDUAL PLACEMENT SUPPORTS THAT CAN BE AVAILABLE TO BE THAT BRIDGE WAY- OF SUPPORTING AN INDIVIDUAL AND TO- HELP BEING THAT SUCCESS- NOT ONLY FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BUT FOR THE BUSINESS THAT IS- DOING THE HIRING SO WE CAN HELP PREPARE THEM- FOR THE EXPERIENCE AND THE OPPORTUNITY. WE WOULD BE LOOKING TO BUILD- STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS AND SO WE HAVE SUCCESS WITH HAVING GRANT PROGRAMS AS AN EXAMPLE WITHIN OUR- SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY WE'VE LEARNED A LOT OVER THE LAST- FOUR TO FIVE YEARS OF IMPLEMENTING A GRANT PROGRAM WE WOULD USE SOME OF THOSE PRACTICES THAT HAVE BEEN- REALLY HELPFUL IN THOSE LESSONS LEARNED IN ESTABLISHING THE GRANT PROGRAM. ONE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT FOR- WHAT- WOULD BE IMPORTANCE TO INCLUDE FOR OUTCOMES AND MEASURES AND TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHAT IS THE- BENEFIT- OF THIS INVESTMENT SO HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS ARE ABLE TO SECURE EMPLOYMENT. WHAT IS THAT OUR REGION BEING ABLE TO TRACK AS TO WHAT IS THAT ENGAGEMENT AND THOSE CONNECTIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE- AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO AND TRACKING- THE SUCCESS OF MORE OF AN ON GOING BUT ALSO ADDRESSING THE MORE RECENT ISSUES AS DIRECTOR DAVE YOUR HAD NOTED. THAT WE HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE AND- INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE- COMPETITIVE COMPETITIVELY AND CHLORATE AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC- WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A PRETTY HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR THE- WHO ARE REGIONAL CENTER CONSUMERS- BUT IT CERTAINLY WAS MAGNIFIED DURING THE PANDEMIC- SO WE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS PROPOSAL AND- AND DO LOOK FORWARD TO THE COLLABORATIVE EFFORT WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AND. WITH OUR PARTNERS AT DEPARTMENT OF REHAB. THANK YOU MUCH THE FOR ANYTHING- CHRIS O'NEILL DEPARTMENTS FINANCE NOT BEEN BROTHER THAT MEASURE. ED MISTAKE ANYTHING. JUST REAL BRIEFLY MANAGER THANK YOU SENATE HEADED FROM THE L. A. O. WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT- IT REALLY HAS BEEN A LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY IS THAT PARTICULARLY SINCE THE LEGISLATURE PASSED TO THE EMPLOYMENT FIRST LAW IN TWENTY THIRTEEN TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYMENT COMPETITIVE AND INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND SO THE ONE WELL WE DON'T HAVE THAT ARTICULAR CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL AND LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING MORE ABOUT HOW THESE EFFORTS ARE CARRIED OUT- WOULDN'T ONE INTENTIONAL THING WE'D RAISE FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION IS JUST THE IMPORTANCE OF PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE STILL WORKING AT SUB MINIMUM WAGE. JOBS AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT GIVEN THE POTENTIAL POSSIBILITY THAT THERE COULD BE POLICY CHANGES AT EITHER THE FEDERAL OR STATE LEVEL TO SORT OF- SHE'S OUT- SUB MINIMUM WAGE FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL. DISABILITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR AS A AT A GOOD POINT- POLICY I AM GLAD TO SEE THIS COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE TWO DEPARTMENTS I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO THINK IT'S SMART AND THEN YOU'RE- YOU ARE USING- THE DEPARTMENT EVERY HAVE FOR THINGS THAT THEY'RE BETTER AT AND YOU CAN CONTINUE THEN TO. TO DO YOUR PART SO THIS SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE I HAVE A QUESTION JUST JUST BASED ON A AND I HAVE NOT BEEN IN DIRECT PRACTICE. FOR A LONG TIME BUT I'M JUST WONDERING. DO YOU KNOW ANY EDUCATION AND- OUT WE COMMUNICATION WITH PARA OF THOSE WITH THE BILL THIS. HIGH I REMEMBER- IN THE PAST ANYWAY. IT'S PITCH BEEN A WHILE BUT THAT. I HAVE ESPECIALLY LATINO FOR TO TEN TO TENDED TO BE VERY. VERY CLOSE KNIT AND- AND CARE GIVER FOR THEIR- ADULT CHU- BUT SOMETIMES. I THINK IT WAS TOO MUCH FOR THEM TO GO TO WORK WAS BEING VERY PROTECTIVE AND WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE OKAY. IT DOES THAT REMAIN AN ISSUE. WITHIN THE DD COMMUNITY THAT THAT SOMETIMES FAMILY MEMBERS ARE. NOT AS WILLING TO LET- FOLKS THAT SPREAD THEIR WINGS AND FLY A LITTLE BIT MORE UP TO THEIR- FULL CAPACITY AND IF. SO DO. DO WE NEED A DIRECTED SERVICES FOR THAT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- WHAT AN EXCELLENT QUESTION- AND IN AWARENESS OF- AARON INDIVIDUALS HER GOING THROUGH SCHOOL THERE'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT EFFORT OVER THE LAST MANY YEARS- BRINGING AWARENESS TO WHAT IS THE CAREER PATH OR WHAT IS THAT PASSED THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE CHOOSING ONCE THEY'RE LEAVING HIGH SCHOOL- AND EARLY ENGAGEMENT AND TALKING WITH INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILIES OF THOSE TRANSITIONS FROM- HIGH SCHOOL TO- EMPLOYMENTS- STARTING AT AGE SIXTEEN AND- YOU KNOW AS THEY GO THROUGH IN THE CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE OCCURRED- ON. THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE HEARD THAT YOU KNOW AND I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION TO CONTINUE TO RAISE AND MAYBE EVEN A SPOTLIGHT ON TO SEE WHAT TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING- BUT I WILL SAY THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM FAMILIES- FROM VARIOUS COMMUNITIES- THAT. SOME CONCERNS ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT HOW DOES THIS IMPACT- MIGHT BENEFIT YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES TO MANAGE THROUGH THOSE CONCERNS WHAT IS THE SAFE WAY TO GET TO THE JOB YOU KNOW IT'S TRANSPORTATION AVAILABLE AND SO ABSOLUTELY ALL OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT YOU KNOW AND AS WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN CAL ABLE AND HAD INDIVIDUALS BE ABLE TO HAVE- CAL ABLE ACCOUNTS YOU KNOW AND TO TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT DOES THIS MEAN TO BENEFITS THAT EDUCATION ELEMENT IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND I- I THINK WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS ACTUALLY TAKE THAT ALSO BACK TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE EXPLORING WHATEVER OPPORTUNITIES AND BUT- THAT WE CAN LET THAT PERTAINING TO FAMILY SO THANK YOU FOR RAISING THAT QUESTION. THANK YOU THANK RICHARD. OUR DEPENDENCY THING ON THIS. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK. THE BEING DONE TO TRY TO- TO- A. N. PLAMEN AND A AS IT IS AND IT'S- NOT AS A HOME. CERTAINLY NOT CHARITY- AT MY CORE I GUESS IS IN TERMS OF OUT REACH I KNOW THIS IS A IT'S A SO TEND TO BE MORE COMFORTABLE WORKING WITH OTHER BIG INSTITUTIONS AND SO- YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT CONVENIENCE LAWYERS AND- YOU KNOW WORKING CHAMBERS AND SO FORTH- YES WHO YOU SPEAK TO. HELP INSTANCE ONLY TWO MILLION BUT- WE- D. O. R. IN TERMS OF HOW YOU GOT OUT REACH PARTICULARLY TO SMALL BUSINESSES I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF THEM BUT THEY DO GENERATE- THERE ABOUT DEL 45% OF ALL THE JOBS AND SO FORTH OUT THERE- AND MANY OF THE ENTRY LEVEL ONES- HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU SEE THESE EFFORTS- IN TERMS OF- REACHING OUT TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND LIKE LOCAL CHAMBERS AND SO FORTH TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYMENT OF PEOPLE DISABILITIES. THANK YOU SENATE ALL START THAT UP CONVERSATION JONES AND YOUR- AND WE HAVE SO YOUR YOUR RESPOND ON WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SMALL BUSINESS BEING FRANKLY COLLECTIVELY THE LARGEST EMPLOYER IN THE STATE AND SO YES WE WANT TO LEVERAGE- CHAMBER OF COMMERCE SAYS BOTH THE STATE LEVEL CERTAINLY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AS WELL AS TRADE ORGANIZATIONS WE REALLY WANT TO FLIP THIS PARADIGM AND COME AT IT FROM. WHERE BUSINESSES CONNECTED CONNECTED THERE ARE AND PROVIDE THEM WITH- YOU KNOW THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS THAT ANDY DESCRIBED BUT BUT ALSO REALLY TO. LEAN INTO THE HIRING PROCESS WITHIN THOSE BUSINESSES AS WELL AS A POTENTIALLY EVEN A COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WERE DOING THE HIRING AND LEADERSHIP IN THOSE. RESPECTIVE ORGANIZATIONS- REALLY LEANING INTO ONE HELL OF A JUST A DIFFERENT MIND SET ABOUT HIRING INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES SO. COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE THAT THAT IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TARGET THAT WILL BE DEVELOPING THAT IN THE COMING WEEKS. OKAY THANK YOU- SAID SINCE. A LARGE VISIBLE EASIER BECAUSE THEY'RE BIG AND WE'RE BIG- BUT- I THINK THAT SPECIAL TALK ABOUT GRANTS AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS IN YOUR SMALL BUSINESS HELD MANY OF THE BARRIERS ARE MORE SUBSTANTIAL OF YOU DON'T HAVE A WHOLE HR DEPARTMENT THINGS LIKE THAT YOUR LESLIE HE'LL LOOK AT GRANT AND GRANT REQUIREMENTS YOU MAY BE DISCOURAGED FROM. PURSUING THOSE BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF WORK IT MIGHT INVOLVE WORSE A LARGER BUSINESS WITH THAT H. R. DEPARTMENT LEGAL DEPARTMENT NOT SO MUCH OF THE NATION MAY BE LESS OF AN ISSUE SO- APPRECIATE- YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT BE SURE THAT WE HAVE A SMALL BUSINESSES THAT CAN GET ACCESS TO THESE THINGS TO ENCOURAGE AGAIN SMALL BUSINESS EMPLOYMENT OF PEOPLE DISABILITIES SO APPRECIATE THE EFFORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY SHOULD WE CONTINUE ON UNDER DEPARTMENT- WITH THE ISSUE ISSUE NUMBER THREE. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SO ON AND- ISSUE THREE WHICH IS. MANY OF THE ITEMS ARE REFERENCED AND THANK STAFF FOR OUTLINING THE PROPOSALS ON PAGE FIVE TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND THAT IF THEY DID A GREAT JOB AND ASK THAT YOU NOT GOING TO A LOT OF DETAIL ON. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE- PROMISE YOU I WON'T. YEAH IF I COULD GO AHEAD AND HIGHLIGHT A FEW THINGS OF COURSE. WE TRUST YOUR JUDGMENT. HELLO AND FEEL FREE TO LET ME KNOW IF THERE'S TOO MUCH DETAIL WATER WE'RE HAPPY TO AND- RESPOND TO THAT AS A COMMITTEES- WISHES- THE- AREAS THAT WE ARE GOING TO FOCUS MORE ON- ON THIS AGENDA AND ISSUE ITEM IS SELF DETERMINATION IMPLICIT BIAS AND LETTERMAN ACT PROVISIONAL ELIGIBILITY. AND BE COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT AND THEN THE PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAM CHANGES I'M JUST OF NOTES WHEN WE WERE PREPARING THE- PROPOSED BUDGET THERE REALLY WERE KIND OF FOUR PILLARS ARE FOR AREAS THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE BUILDING YOU KNOW REALLY UNDER THE SAME LANDS OF. THE GOVERNOR'S I'M FOCUSED ON ON BUILDING KIND OF STRENGTH AND LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN MOVE CALIFORNIA STRONGER AND SO THE AREAS IN WHICH WE WERE FOCUSED ON WAS CONTINUED EFFORTS AND IDENTIFYING WAYS TO DO SYSTEM CAPACITY ENHANCEMENT AND STRENGTHENING. AND THEN SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY ARE CONTINUE TO WORK- TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS TO ACCESS- SERVICES THROUGH THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM. AND THEN ALSO OUR SAFETY NET SERVICES AND THEN CONTINUING TO- FOCUS IN RESPONSE TO PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AS IT RELATES TO- COALBED AS WELL AS LONGER TERM- STRATEGIES FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE. I'M SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE NOTE OF A FEW THINGS WITHIN THE SYSTEM CAPACITY ENHANCEMENTS IS ON BEING ABLE TO ELIMINATE THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE CONTINUED B. EIGHT POINT TWO PERCENT- SUPPLEMENTAL- RATE INCREASE FOR PROVIDERS- AND THEN I'LL ALSO REALLY LEFT ENOUGH THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR WORKFORCE OUR DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONALS. AND WILL GO INTO MORE DETAIL LATER IN THE AGENDA ON OUR PROPOSAL THERE BUT WE ALSO HAD- AN AREA A PROPOSAL. TO BE ABLE TO- PROVIDES TYPE IN TO OUR WORK- ARE WITH SERVICE PER- FOR BILINGUE PAY- AND THEN- MOVING TO SERVICE ACCESS AND EQUITY CERTAINLY MANY OTHER THINGS WHICH WE'RE GOING TO I'M SURE BRIEFLY ON- REGARDING LIKE THE PROVISIONAL ELIGIBILITY IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO HAVE BEEN ASSURANCE THAT. WE ARE ON BEING MINDFUL OF- ARE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND HAVING ACCESS TO SERVICES- AT THIS VERY YOUNG AGE ALSO LOOKING AT ENHANCING SERVICE COORDINATION FOR INDIVIDUALS AND CONSUMERS WITH LOW OR NO PL WEST WHICH IS IN ALIGNMENT. WITH THE SERVICE- ACCESS GRANT PROGRAMS AND EXPANDING- A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM THAT. WAS DEVELOPED BY EAST LA REGIONAL CENTER ON AND THEN- MY COLLEAGUE- A CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR- MR WINFIELD WILL BE ADDRESSING AND PROVIDING A REVIEW AND THEN PLACED UP BY US- AND THEN. GOING TO THE SAFETY NET SERVICES AS I NOTED THAT WE WOULD BE EXPANDING EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS IN OUR START SERVICES SO I'VE BEEN ASKED TO FOCUS ON THOSE AREAS THAT NOTED SELF DETERMINATION AND SUPPORTS- WE'RE PROPOSING AN INCREASE OF TEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL FINE. OF WHICH IS SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION A GENERAL FUND TO REALLY IMPROVE THE ON BOARDING OF BRINGING INDIVIDUALS TO- SUCCESSFULLY- PARTICIPATE AND SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM. JUST REAL QUICK BY WAY OF BACKGROUND AND A REMINDER THAT ON THE STATUTE WAS A- IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN IT WAS UNDER SENATE BILL FOUR SIXTY EIGHT. IN WHICH THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM WAS AUTHORIZED TO BE DEVELOPED. IT HAD A THREE YEAR PHASE AND- IT THAT TIME. AND DURING THE THAT TIME WE WERE ABLE TO- BRING ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY INDIVIDUALS- INTO SELF DETERMINATION TO ACTIVELY SPEND UNDER THE NEW PROGRAM. AND BE ABLE TO HAVE AND TO PARTICIPATE UNDER THE KEEP FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF- UP TO TERMINATION WHICH IS ABOUT FREEDOM CONTROL AND RESPONSIBILITY. HOWEVER WE WORK YOU KNOW DURING THAT TIME WOULD HAVE HAD THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT AB TWO G. TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND WE CERTAINLY. MORE SHORT OF THAT. YEAH AND SO DURING THIS TIME WE DID SEE SOME OF THE BARRIERS AND I'M CERTAINLY ADVOCATE SOME FAMILY MEMBERS WERE VERY VERY GOOD ABOUT SHARING WITH US THOSE STRUGGLES AND THE CHALLENGES AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE BARRIERS. YOU KNOW HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH OPENING STATEWIDE AS OF JULY FIRST- THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH OUR WAIVER- AND THEN MENTOR- RENEWAL OF THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM. MANY OF THE VARIOUS IT THAT WE HEARD THAT WE ARE INTERESTING WITH THIS PROPOSAL IS- LOOKING AT HOW CAN WE STANDARDIZE- EFFORTS TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT ACROSS THE STATE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LEARNING ABOUT SELF DETERMINATION ARE LEARNING. YOU KNOW CONSISTENTLY. THROUGH ORIENTATION A- TRAINING THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO. ANY BUDDY WHO'S INTERESTED ANY CONSUMER AND FAMILY MEMBER INTERESTED IN SELF DETERMINATION. ADDITIONALLY IT WOULD THEN PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FREQUENCY OF TRAINING- AND HAVE INSURANCE THAT WE ARE ALSO DOING IT MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. AS WELL AS FOCUSING ON PLAIN LANGUAGE FOR ACCESSIBILITY FOR INDIVIDUALS- WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING A LIMITED TERM RESOURCE FOR PARTICIPATING CHOI SPECIALIST AT THE REGIONAL CENTERS- CERTAINLY FOUND THAT REGIONAL CENTERS- DUE TO SHORT. AND OTHER- HIGH CASELOADS AND I'M NOT ABLE TO REALLY MOVE FORWARD WE ARE SAYING THAT WE NEED TO HELP SUPPORT NOT ONLY THE FAMILIES- AND TARGET- I'M- STOP ADVOCATE CHEN TRANSITIONING THROUGH- BASED ON SOME OF THE SUPPORT WE CAN PROVIDE BUT ALSO THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO BE A REALLY KEY SUPPORTER- AND- I'M KIND DO IT TO SUCCESS. SO WE ARE PROPOSING- OF THE TEN- AT TEN POINT THREE MILLION THAT THERE WOULD BE SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION THAT WOULD GO TO PARTICIPATE CHOICE SPECIALISTS THAT WOULD BE AT THE REGIONAL CENTER. THIS ASSUMES BETWEEN FIFTY FIVE AND SIXTY- SPECIALISTS THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE THAT WOULD REALLY KNOW AND SELF DETERMINATION AND SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS TO MOVE TIMELY- THROUGH THE PROCESS AND ACHIEVING PARTICIPATION- WE ALSO HAVE NOTED THAT WE ARE SUBMITTING A AND I'M REALLY SEEN A SELF DETERMINATION PLAN. THAT IS OUTLINED TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC BARRIERS AND TO HAVE- SUPPORT INTO THOSE KEY PRINCIPLES OF SELF DETERMINATION. AND AGAIN SOME OF THOSE AREAS THAT WERE WANTING TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS AND THAT WOULD BE AN INCREASING TRANSITION SUPPORT- AND THE FUNDING THAT WOULD BE PART OF THAT TEN MILLION WOULD NEED TO GO TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS TO TRANSITION QUICKLY AND THAT CAN BE. THROUGH COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS HELP. IN OUR FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS AND OTHER SECOND HELPING. WHO ARE RELEASED TO COULD BE OF LANGUAGE OUT. THERE COULD BE A NUMBER OF REASONS I'M SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE INVESTING AND HELPING THEM MOVE ON QUICKLY THROUGH THE PROCESS. WE ALSO REALLY WANT TO STRENGTHEN THE PROGRAM TO HAVE INSURANCE TO SUSTAINABILITY AND THE FUTURE AND SO WITH THAT THE PLAN. AND THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IT ON BUILDING INTO THE PROGRAM IS. MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE ALSO BEING VERY MINDFUL OF HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH THE PROGRAM- AND VARIOUS COMMUNITIES- WE ARE ALREADY SEEING A IN EQUITY AS TO ACCESS TO THE SERVICES BASED ON. ETHNICITY THAT WE ARE SAYING THAT OUR CONSUMERS WHO ARE WHITE ARE MOVING THROUGH AND SUCCEEDING IN INTO THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM FASTER THAN- OTHER- ETHNICITIES AND PARTICULARLY WITHIN OUR LATINO AND ARE. AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY WE'RE STILL SEEING SOME DIFFERENCES- OF INEQUITY OF SPENDING IN THIS PROGRAM- AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE ALSO ADDRESSING AND SUPPORTING THE PROGRAM TO BE ABLE TO. EARLY ON- HAVE ASSURANCES THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING THOSE CONCERNS BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING THAT- AGAIN AND IT'S EARLY ON WE ONLY HAVE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MORE TO LEARN BUT IT'S ALSO A GREAT TIME TO BE ABLE TO SAY. HOW DO WE HELP OUR LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILIES BE ABLE TO MOVE THROUGH THAT THE PROGRAM AND BE ABLE TO- APPROPRIATELY ACCESS AND ACHIEVE SUCCESS. ON BOTH THE PARTICIPATION BUT ACCESSING SERVICES AS WELL. I'M SO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON ON SELF DETERMINATION AFTER. WE FINISH WITH IT TOO TWO OTHER AND- ITEMS WHICH IS IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING. AS WELL AS BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION REGARDING PROVISIONAL ELIGIBILITY AND- BRIAN WINFIELD. WILL BE PROVIDING THAT TO YOU TODAY. MISTER WINTER. I APOLOGIZE I LOST CONNECTION THERE FOR A MINUTE. WE ALL DO SIR. SO THE NEXT TOPIC I WILL COVER IS THE LIST OF BIAS TRAINING- THIS IS A REQUEST FOR FUNDING OF SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TOTAL FUNDS AND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE THOUSAND GENERAL FUND THE VALUE OF IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING IS THAT IT RAISES AWARENESS OF OUR OWN BIASES THAT COME FROM MY OWN LIFE EXPERIENCES THAT WOULD MEAN I NEED TO BE WARE OF- PROVIDE STRATEGIES AND TOOLS YOU CAN USE TO DISTRACT INSPIRED SINS. AND HELPS TO ELIMINATE THESE BIASES THAT CONFIDENCE TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT FAVOR WORKS AND OTHER PEOPLE SHRUM WE'RE REQUESTING THIS FUNDING FOR THE TRAINING FOR A REGIONAL CENTER STAFF WHO ARE INVOLVED IN- ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS AND INTAKES. AND THE SPECIFICALLY TARGETED GENE TO THOSE CLINICIANS AND. INTAKE WORKERS AFTER REGIONAL CENTERS. M. SIR REGIONAL CAN TOWARD ENOUGH I NEED TO IMPROVE CULTURAL MARKERS COMMENT IN THIS. WITH ADDITIONAL TRAINING REGIONAL CENTER STAFF AND SERVICE PROVIDERS SO IT'S THE DRESSES. THAT ISSUE. STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN HAVE NOT BEEN PROPORTIONATELY DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER. WHAT HAPPENED STEVEN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER DIAGNOSIS SEVEN OLDER AGE AS COMPARED TO CHILDREN WHO ARE WHITE. DELAYED DIAGNOSIS INSTANT ACCESS TO SERVICES CAN. CREATING LIFELONG IMPACTS- SOMEONE SUMMARY IN PLACE BIAS- TRAINING FOR ELIGIBILITY DIFFERENT TERMINATIONS CAN LEAD TO. THE DELAY DIAGNOSIS AND ACCESS TO SERVICES AND- CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY CHIU JEANS DISPARITIES IMPROVE SERVICE ACCESS INEQUITY IN OUR SYSTEM. OKAY THANK YOU. NEXT I WILL COVER THAT PROVISIONAL ELIGIBILITY. THIS IS A REQUEST. FOR TWENTY THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION IN GENERAL FUND FOR BOTH REGIONAL CENTER OPERATIONS AND JOHNSON- PURCHASE OF SERVICE- HASN'T PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED WE HAVE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WERE SEARCHING THE EARLY START PROGRAM. AS OF MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE THIRTY START ENROLLMENT IS DOWN 10% AS COMPARED TO THE SAME MONTH LAST YEAR. BEFORE THIS DECLINE THE DEPARTMENT WAS ALREADY% REVIEWING DATED JULY WITH THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN. LEAVE EARLY START AND LATER RE ENTERED THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SYSTEM INDICATING THAT LANTERN ACT ELIGIBLE DISCIPLINES MAY NOT BE SOLELY RECOGNIZED AT TWO YEARS AND NINE MONTHS WHEN ASSESSMENTS CHEN TRANSITIONS. TO THE SCHOOL SYSTEM ARE CONDUCTED. BY CREATING PROVISIONAL. THIS SIXTEEN. ELIGIBLE FOR CHILDREN PREVIOUSLY LEFT THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM AND LATER RETURNED AS WELL AS OTHER CHILDREN AGES THREE AND FOUR YEARS OLD. WHO HAVE DISABILITIES WHICH RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS AND MAJOR LIFE ACTIVITIES ARE CURRENTLY NOT NEED LAMPEN ACT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT CHILDREN AGES TO REFORM BE SERVED IN THE EARLY START PROGRAM FIRST. ANALYSIS OF GST TO IDENTIFY CHILDREN WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE EARLY START SERVICE INSTANT EXITING THE SERVICE INSTRUMENT AGE THREE OR LATER. DETERMINED ELIGIBLE FOR LAND CONNECT SERVICES OF THE OVER SIXTY TWO THOUSAND CHILDREN AGES FIVE TO JUNE YOU SEEN MANSION ACCIDENTS SINCE BEEN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY APPROXIMATELY EIGHT PERCENT- OF THESE CHILDREN EXPERIENCED A GAP. BETWEEN BERNIE STARTIN LANTERN NEXT SERVICE SINCE. THE CHILDREN HAVE EXPERIENCED THE GAP IN SERVICES HAVE AUTISM 75% OF US HAVE AUTISM. ALTHOUGH CLINICIANS ARE ABLE TO MAKE RELIABLE DIAGNOSES OF AUTISM IN TODDLERS DETERMINING WHETHER IT'S FOR YEAR OLD CHILDREN THE CURRENT DEFINITION OF SUBSTANTIAL DISABILITY UNDER THE LANHAM ACT. PRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. THIS NEW SYSTEM. THAT WITH LONG TO WHO HAVE GAS IN SIR IN DURING CLINICAL EXPERIENCE. AND A PROVISIONAL IS GOING REPRESENTS AN INDO OF THE- THAT WOULD BE REDUCE ABOUT MY RAINS IMPROVE ONE TERM NOW. MAXIMIZING THE EXAM TO KEEP CHILDREN FAMILIES HOME AND THE NEED FOR MORE. SERVICE. AND LASTLY I WILL ON COVER THE- PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAM AND THE- COMPETITIVE IN GRADING PLAN THAT. INCENTIVE PAYMENTS. WE ARE PROPOSING. TO SENATE PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAM BECAUSE SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE NOT FUNDED FOR DEVELOPMENT IN PLACEMENT INTO THESE PAID INTERNSHIPS WE'RE PROPOSING FUNDING AT THE THIRTY DAY MARK AND THAT SIXTY DAY MARK AFTER THESE EIGHT INTERNSHIPS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND FOR THE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS- WE CURRENTLY SERVICE PROVIDERS CAN SEE INCENTIVE AFTER THIRTY DAY MARK WHEN A PERSON HAS AND COMPETITIVELY EMPLOYED. AND THE SIX MONTH MARK AND A TWO YEAR MARK WE ARE PROPOSING TO ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS ONE AT EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND ANOTHER ONE THAT TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. AND LASTLY WITH REDUCTIONS ENTERTAINMENTS MMHM DURING BUDGET YEAR WE'RE PROPOSING ADDITIONAL FUNDING ON TOP OF THE CURRENT INCENTIVES THAT THE THIRTY DAY MARK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY MARKING THIS IS JEAN INCENTIVIZE- KIND OF THAT WE DO DEVELOPMENT PLAN THAT- AS WE MOVE OUT OF THE PANDEMIC TO HELP INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE BECOME COMPETITIVELY. EMPLOYABLE THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU MUCH- BERMAN FINANCE. CHRIS ONEONTA OF FINANCE- TOOK THIRD- TO ADD ON TO- SESSION OF THE LAST PROPOSAL I'M CLEAR FOR ITS IT'S- AB THE REVISIONS QUESTIONING AT- NEW FUNDS FOR THE PURPOSES OF THESE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS THAT WERE YEARS AREN'T EXISTING FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED THROUGH AB. ACTS YOU WANT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN- IT'S TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S AVAILABLE. FOR THESE PURPOSES- AND- MUCH THAT BECAUSE I EXPANDED RIGHT NOW AND SO THESE ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO COME OUT OF THOSE EXISTING EXPENDITURES APPROPRIATIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION BELIAU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SENATE HEADED FOR THE L. A. O. I HAVE JUST TWO OVER ARCHING COMMENTS A QUICK POINT ABOUT THE INTERNSHIP PROGRAM AND THEN I FIND A COUPLE OF FINAL POINTS ABOUT THE SELF DETERMINATION- PROPOSED CHANGES. SO FIRST A NUMBER OF THESE PROPOSALS REALLY SEEK TO PROMOTE GREATER ACCESS TO SERVICES PARTICULARLY TO THOSE PREVIOUSLY UNDER SERVED AND GENERALLY WE'D SAY THAT THE INTENDED GOALS OF THESE- PROPOSAL SEEM TO REFLECT WHAT JUST LATER PRIORITIES BASED ON PREVIOUS ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE LEGISLATURE TO. INCREASE ACCESS TO SERVICES AND ALSO TO REDUCE DISPARITIES ALONG- DISPARITIES IN AND PURCHASE OF SERVICE ALONG RACIAL AND ETHNIC LINES. AND WE WOULD SAY HOWEVER THAT MOST OF THE PROPOSALS EVEN IF THEY HAVE MERIT DO LACK- A LOT OF DETAIL ON HOW THE FISCAL ESTIMATE WAS DERIVED SO JUST FOR EXAMPLE WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW MANY A BILINGUAL STAFF TEDIOUS- ESTIMATES WILL RECEIVE THE WAGE DIFFERENTIALS AND WHETHER THIS IS IN LINE WITH SORT OF THE ESTIMATES OF THE NUMBER OF CONSUMERS WHO MIGHT NEED THOSE SERVICES. AND WE HAVE TO PUT IN A REQUEST FOR THIS INFORMATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AND I WILL BE HAPPY TO SHARE THOSE DETAILS WITH BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE STAFF WHEN WE RECEIVE IT. ON THE PAY INTERNSHIP- THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE LANGUAGE ON FOR UNPAID INTERNSHIPS WE WOULD NOTE THAT- CURRENTLY- PAID INTERNSHIPS ARE CAPPED AT AN ANNUAL AMOUNT BASED ON AN EARLIER AND LOWER STATEWIDE MINIMUM WAGE. SO IN ADDITION TO THE PROPOSED AT THE CURRENT PROPOSAL LANGUAGE THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT ALSO CONSIDER ANOTHER REFINEMENT SO AS TO NOT NECESSARILY A LIMITATION INDIVIDUALS CHANCE TO WORK ON. IT FULL TIME INTERNSHIP OVER THE COURSE OF A SINGLE YEAR. NO ON THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO SELF DETERMINATION- TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE ARE CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM EASE ENROLLMENT OR- HE'S HE'S IN AS A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION TO THE PROGRAM. THAT WOULD REALLY SEEM IN LINE WITH LEGISLATIVE INTENT TO MAKE THE PROGRAM AVAILABLE TO ANY INTERESTED CONSUMER WE ARE STILL REVIEWING THE- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WAS JUST RELEASED YESTERDAY BUT WE DO HAVE TO INITIAL OBSERVATIONS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO FLAG FOR THE SUB COMMITTEE. SO FIRST WE DO THINK IT SEEMS REASONABLE TO REQUIRE REGIONAL CENTERS IN DDS TO REVIEW ON A REGULAR OR ANNUAL BASIS THAT INDIVIDUAL BUDGETS THAT EXCEEDS SPECIFIED SPENDING THRESHOLDS IN ORDER TO KEEP THE PROGRAM COST EFFECTIVE. A SECOND POINT IS IF WE ARE INTERPRETING- THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE CORRECTLY IT APPEARS TO REQUIRE THAT SELECTION OF SPECIFIC SERVICE PROVIDERS FOLLOW CURRENT STATUTE. WHICH REQUIRES THAT CONSUMERS SELECTED THE LEAST COSTLY PROVIDER AMONG COMPARABLE SERVICE PROVIDERS. NOW IN SOME WAYS THAT STRIKES US AS POTENTIALLY INCONSISTENT WITH THE WHOLE POINT OF SELF DETERMINATION WHICH IS TO INCREASE CONSUMER CHOICE AND SO OUR QUESTION- THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO ASK OF THE ADMINISTRATION IS. IF THE INDIVIDUALS TOTAL SPENDING REMAINS WITHIN THEIR APPROVED BUDGET MIGHT IT BE POSSIBLE TO ADD SOME LEEWAY TO THE CONSUMERS CHOICE OF THEIR THEIR INDIVIDUAL SPECIFIC SERVICE PROVIDERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A- MS BARTON ARE YOU ARE YOU WILL OBSERVER ABLE TO SPEAK TO THAT RIGHT NOW ABOUT THE ISSUE AROUND SELF DETERMINATION AND CHOICE. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND CERTAINLY THE INTENT OF THE LANGUAGE IS NOT TO TAKE AWAY CHOICE FLEXIBILITY AND REALLY NO CENTRAL CORE VALUES OF WHAT SELF DETERMINATION IS ABOUT AND WE WOULD- WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE NOTING THAT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT WANTING TO CHANGE THOSE THOSE VERY KEY PRINCIPLES- AND HAPPY TO HAVE- DISCUSSIONS AROUND THE LANGUAGE OF COST EFFECTIVENESS BECAUSE REALLY BE. LOOKING AT AT THE COST EFFECTIVENESS IS NOT ABOUT LIMITING CHOICE HEY- IT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN THOSE INSTANCES WHEN YOU HAVE- OPPORTUNITIES WHERE THEY'RE KIND OF EQUAL CHOICE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE SAME OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS THAT- REALLY BEING MINDFUL OF HOW ARE YOU GOING TO- HAVE KIND OF DECISION MAKING OF USING MORE AT THE LEAST COSTLY- THIS REALLY IS A MAIN- AGAIN NOT TO LIMIT THE CHOICE. BUT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE EARLY DATA THAT WERE SEEN- AND THE EXPENDITURES FOR SELF DETERMINATION- AND WE ARE- ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORTING AND AS YOU KNOW WE'RE VERY COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS- PARTICULARLY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHO HAVE HAD A REAL STRUGGLE IN ACCESS TO SERVICES UNDER TRADITIONAL SERVICES A GOOD EXAMPLE IS THAT- IF- INDEPTH FAMILY WHO IS WHO IS MONOLINGUAL. AS THE SPANISH THAT HAS RESPITE SERVICES BUT THEY CAN'T ACCESS THE RESPITE SERVICES BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A SPANISH SPEAKING- M. AS THE- SUPPORT WERE THAT CAN GO INTO AND PER SERVE. THAT'S CLEARLY SOMETHING THAT THE FAMILY IS NOT ABLE TO HAVE EXPENDITURES IN WHICH- PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS EXPENDITURES YOU DRIVE WHAT THE BRIGHT BUDGET IS FOR THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM BILLS ARE UNMET NEEDS AND ABSOLUTELY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT A BARRIER FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS- SO INTEL CUTTING GETTING CLARITY AND TO WHAT HE- WHAT'S DRIVING SOME OF THE INCREASES. FROM THE TWELVE MONTHS PRIOR EXPENSES OF PARTICIPANTS TO BUDGET- IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE VISIBILITY INTO AND AS I NOTED ONE OF OUR OUR GOALS ALSO IS SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PROGRAM. SO JUST AS A REAL BRIEF EXAMPLE YOU KNOW AND WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT KIND OF THOSE AVERAGE EXPENDITURES- WE ARE SEEING- CERTAINLY DIFFERENCES OF THE PRECUT OF- EXPENDITURES AS TWELVE MONTHS PRIOR TO SELF DETERMINATION- THERE'S AN AVERAGE SPEND AND THEN WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE BUDGETS. IT'S ACTUALLY- NOTABLY HIGH. SO WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS- AND UNDERSTANDING THEIR CONCERNS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ADDRESS SEEN- THAT THERE'S NOT SOMETHING PRESENTING- A BARRIER TO EITHER DELAYING THE PROGRAM. OR BEING A BARRIER TO ACCESSING SERVICES WE LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL AS ON WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN NINE DID YOU TALK ABOUT REDUCING BARRIERS FOR OUR COMMUNITY COLOR COUPLE TIMES AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO- BUT I ALSO JUST AT THE API COMMUNITY AND WHO'S ALSO- LANGUAGE OFTENTIMES SPANS. MULTIPLE DIFFERENT KINDS OF LANGUAGES IN INDIANA I FEEL SURE YOU'RE TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AS WELL. YES MATT INSURANCE CERTAINLY WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE SEEING- SUMMIT THAT NOT ONLY WITHIN THE LANGUAGE BARRIER BUT- IT BUT CULTURALLY AS WELL AND BEING VERY SENSITIVE PARTICULARLY AND- BIG COMMUNITY AND ENTERING INTO A PROGRAMS. EARLY ON WHETHER IT'S WITH EARLY START YOU KNOW AND- BUILDING THAT TRUST WITHIN THE COMMUNITY WITH THOSE THAT ARE FROM THE COMMUNITY TO- HAVE SOME- CULTURAL SENSITIVITY AS WELL AS- ADDRESSING LANGUAGE BERRIER SO CORRECT. THANK YOU GREAT I'D- AND I WOULD DEBTS TO FOR ALL OF THESE AYE I THINK AS YOUR AS YOU'RE GETTING AND NEW AND IMPROVED FUNDING. FOR SOME OF THESE NEW PROGRAMS I THINK IT'S GOOD TO KEEP CHECKING BACK WITH US AT LEAST QUARTERLY TO LET US KNOW HOW THESE THINGS ARE COMING ALONG- AND I UNTIL JUST A DAY BEFORE I START TO PANIC HE HAS ANYTHING- AS YOU KNOW I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF- OF THIS DEPARTMENT I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF BEING ABLE TO. REIMBURSE BY OF BUT SOME OF OUR PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN PROVIDING THIS CARE THROUGH THE PANDEMIC WELL WITH THE STATEMENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO- AND AS YOU'RE GOING FORWARD I YEAH I JUST WANNA PROBABLY RECOGNIZE IT'S THE FIRST TIME YOU'RE DEPARTMENT HAS. HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO REALLY DREAM ABOUT HOW WE FULLY FUND SOME MORE OF YOUR PROGRAMS- SO- I GUESS CONGRATULATIONS THAT- THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE BEING ABLE TO SHARE- AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I KNOW YOUR DEPARTMENT OFTEN FEELS AND THE COMMUNITY THAT YOU SERVE. OFTEN FEELS A LITTLE LEFT OUT. WHEN GOOD THINGS HAPPEN. DR GRANT. I THANK YOU JERRY WENT ACTUALLY JUST. A QUICK PER QUESTION ISSUED FOUR WHICH IS ALSO CONSENT PROGRAM OR WE- DID WITH THE INCLUDED IN THIS PRESENTATION BECAUSE WE TALKED BROWN SAID PROGRAMS- WE AT TO GET TO THAT- ISSUE FOR. I THINK WE WERE JUST DOING IT TO THREE RIGHT NOW THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT WE WERE TALKING CENTER PROGRAMS. SURE WE DON'T HAVE AN OVERLAP THERE OKAY- IN TERMS OF MY QUESTION SO FIRST OF ALL I DO APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION- GREEN WITH- WITH US IN TERMS OF THE ELIMINATION OF THE- PROVIDER RATE INCREASES PENSION AND- UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE SO THANK YOU- YOU KNOW THAT SOMETHING WE- TALKED ABOUT FOR MANY YEARS HERE- I ALSO. AND I KNOW THAT- DR APARTMENT YOU YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE HAD NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS ABOUT- BEING SURE THAT- WE ADDRESS I THINK- DISPARITIES- IN THE- TV SYSTEM- AND APPRECIATE THE- DIFFERENT INVESTMENTS HERE OBVIOUSLY THE OUTCOMES ARE GONNA BE IMPORTANT TO HER AND WE TALKED- ALSO ABOUT. THE. IMPORTANCE OF CULTURE CHANGE. AND IN IT AND THE SYSTEM AND TOUGH. SOME NO STORIES ABOUT WHERE FOR SOME CLIENTS OF SELF STATUS- THEY COMPLAINED OUR STATE MADE NOTE OF SIDE CHALLENGES THAT THEY HAD THEIR COMMUNITY THAT THEY MIGHT EVEN BE DENIED SERVICES AND THEY FELT. VULNERABLE IN THAT WAY AND HOW TO BE SURE THAT. THAT WAS IN THE SITUATION AS WELL- BECAUSE WE NEED PEOPLE BILL SPEAK OUT WHEN THEIR CULTURAL OR OTHER BARRIERS- TO- PEOPLE GETTING CARE SO. I DO AGAIN IN PRE IN APPRECIATE THE- IMPLICIT IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING- AND- SOME OF THEM. AND THE ALSO THE BILINGUAL STAFF DIFFERENTIAL I'D APPRECIATE CHAIR RANG UP FOR THE API COMMUTING WHICH ACCESO EVEN WITH BILINGUAL MY GUESS IS THAT WE'RE STILL HAVE A LOT OF LANGUAGE. BARRIER SO. I REALLY THINK HOPE THAT WE CAN LOOK CLOSELY AT HOW THAT BECAUSE IS A VERY FOR A FIFTY P. I. COMMUNITY- SO- SO I GUESS I'D THAT SO AGAIN- YEAH. LOOKING FOR JUST CONTINUE MONETARY BOTH MONITORING BUT ALSO LOOKING AT- THE OUTCOMES THAT COME FROM THESE INVESTMENTS TO BE SURE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO MOVE THE NEEDLE. AND IT IS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO THESE VERY IMPORTANT SERVICES THAT I KNOW YOU THAT YOU IN YOUR DEPARTMENT AND THE REGIONAL CENTERS SO MUCH- SO FORTH. REALLY BELIEVE AND SO- SO OF CERTAINLY ONE BE SURE WE CONTINUE TO PAY ATTENTION AND CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD BEING TRUE WE ELIMINATE THOSE DISPARITIES. THANK YOU AND- AND MISTER WHEN PHIL DID YOU DO NUMBER FOUR I THOUGHT YOU WERE DOING THE COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT AND PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAM BUT PERHAPS- DR PANDA'S CORRECTING YOU SLIPPED INTO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. AS WELL ARE WE STILL GOING TO DO NO MISS PARKER'S CHICKEN ARE AT OKAY. ALL RIGHT. SO LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE THE NUMBER FOR THEM. THANKS FOR THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. YES ON ISSUE FOR- THAT PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM- IT'S REFERENCED IN- HAS FURTHER ETAILS BECAUSE ALL I'LL JUST DO SOME BRIEF HIGHLIGHTS FOR YOU BUT FURTHER DETAIL ON YOUR AGENDA STARTING ON PAGE SEVEN AND I'VE BEEN ASKED TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. I'M STILL A BIT PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAM- FOR BUDGET YEAR HAS PROPOSAL. SIX MILLION TOTAL FUND OF WHICH IS FOUR MILLION IN GENERAL FUND AND THEN INCREASES. I'M AND OUT YEARS TO EIGHT POINT NINE OUR STORY EIGHT EIGHTY NINE POINT FOUR MILLION TOTAL FINE OF WHICH SIXTY ONE MILLION. AND THE BREAKDOWN FOR THAT IS- TO FOCUS ON BUDGET YEAR TO ESTABLISH A STRUCTURE FOR A PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM- WELL WE INTRODUCED- AND HAD A PRIOR PROPOSAL- THAT WAS SIMILAR TO THE LAST WEEK WE DID HEAR FROM THE COMMUNITY AND CONCERNS FROM ADVOCATES ON. CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF OUR PRIOR PROPOSAL. SO WE LISTENED AND WE- PROVIDED SOME MODIFICATIONS- WHILE WE STILL BELIEVE THAT THE RIGHT- PATH FOR WORDS TO- IMPROVING SOME OF THOSE. CONCERNS THAT DR PAN ALSO JUST SHARED- AS WELL AS JUST IMPROVING THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE WITHIN OUR SYSTEM TO- STOP ADVOCATE SOME FAMILY MEMBERS- IS REALLY TO LOOK AT HOW ARE WE MEASURING. THOSE AREAS IN WHICH THAT ARE IMPORTANT- TO INDIVIDUALS BUT THEN ALSO- AREAS THAT ARE MOVING FORWARD AS THE SYSTEM IS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT SO TO GIVE SOME EXAMPLES. THAT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT IS- NOT FULLY THOUGHT OUT AND MAKING SURE THAT IT IS NOT OVERLY COMPLICATED- BUT IS REALLY CLEAR AND SAYING OKAY WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS THAT WE DO KNOW THAT THERE IS- OBVIOUSLY SELF DETERMINATION AS AN EXAMPLE IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT PROGRAM. TO OUR COMMUNITY- OUR CUSTOMER. SATISFACTION AND UNDERSTANDING HOW INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCES ARE- IS ALSO IMPORTANT OUTCOMES ON EMPLOYMENT YOU KNOW ARE WE HELPING INDIVIDUALS BE COMPETITIVELY INTEGRATED- IN IN THE COMMUNITY- AROUND EMPLOYMENT- AND LOOKING AT THESE KEY METRICS AND MAKING SURE THAT- REGIONAL CENTERS ARE. IMPROVING SO THIS FIRST YEAR WE'RE GOING TO ESTABLISH BENCHMARKS THAT WOULD BE FOR STATEWIDE WE WOULD THEN HAVE BENCHMARKS BY EACH REGIONAL CENTER- BECAUSE ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT'S RAISED ERE. IS YOU KNOW HOW WOULD WE HAVE SOME ASSURANCES THAT THE INDICATORS AND TARGETS. YOU KNOW OUR OUR MEETING THE NEEDS OF KIND OF THE BROADER COMMUNITY. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE WOULD BE DOING IS MAKING SURE THAT- REGIONAL CENTERS I'M NOT ONLY HAVE A MEASURE ACROSS THE STATE BUT THEY WOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO HAVE TARGET. THAT DEMONSTRATE PROGRESS WITHIN EACH OF THEIR CATCHMENT AREAS ANOTHER ELEMENT OF THIS WOULD BE REQUIRING COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT- SO EACH REGIONAL CENTER WOULD HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAD ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR COMMUNITY- AND SO THERE'S TRANSPARENCY NOT ONLY AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT AT A LOCAL LEVEL AS WELL- I'VE BEEN ASKED TO ALSO KIND OF ADDRESSED THE ISSUE OF- CASELOAD RATIOS- SO AS- AS I NOTED THAT. IN OUT YEARS THAT THERE'S BE REQUEST FOR A TOTAL FINE OF EIGHTY NINE POINT FOUR MILLION AND THAT REALLY IS. THE THAT THE LION'S SHARE OF THAT IS FOCUSED ON REDUCING CASELOAD RATIOS SO AN ADDITIONAL MEASURE THAT WE WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE REPORTING ON AND MIND ALIVE IS WHAT ARE THOSE CASELOAD RATIOS RIGHT NOW WE'RE SEEING ON AVERAGE ABOUT ONE TO EIGHTY- AND WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT. THE PROPOSAL- WE% WERE IDENTIFYING THAT TO BE ABLE TO- FIND APPROXIMATELY- SIX HUNDRED SERVICE COORDINATORS- THAT THAT PRETTY PROJECTION DEBT THAT WE HAVE PRESENTED- WOULD BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT. AND THERE WOULD BE A SMALL SMALLER PORTION THAT WOULD BE EARMARKED FOR THOSE INCENTIVES AND PAYMENTS TO REGIONAL CENTRES- SO WERE WERE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO STRENGTHEN OUR SYSTEM- AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR DEPARTMENT TO MOVE FORWARD AND TO. NOT ONLY ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF CASELOAD RATIOS THAT IS GOING TO HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT TO BENEFITS OF CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE REPORTING OUT ON WHAT IS THAT- I'LL COME IN THE BENEFIT OF THIS INVESTMENT- BUT IT IT IT DOES KIND OF LEAD US INTO A AB. PERFORMANCE OUTCOME MEASURE- AT AND HAVING PAY MY THAT- WOULD BE TIED TO THAT. SO HAPPY TO ANSWER DECISIONAL QUESTIONS- RELATED TO THIS PROPOSAL. DOCTRINE THANK YOU JUST JUST A CLARIFICATION ON YOUR TESTIMONY BECAUSE- YEAH SO BOTH COULD YOU MENTION THAT. OF THE EIGHTY NINE POINT THREE BEGAN TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. THERE YOU SAID OF LARGE PORTION YOU CAN SPECIFY HOW MUCH OF THIS WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO CASELOAD REDUCTION SO THERE'S THAT AND THEN AND THEN A PORTION. WOULD BE FOR INCENTIVES SO I JUST WANNA BE. ARE YOU SAY THAT OF THE FOR THERE'S A PORTION TO STRICT FOR K. LOW THAT'S REALLY AND SEND AND THERE'S ANOTHER PORTION FOR AND- OURS AT ALL FRIENDS. I JUST CLARIFY THAT. JONES AS FAR AS THE CPAS I'M WHAT LOOKING AT IS. WORK THROUGH THE- OVER THIS YEAR IS TO KIND OF THAT BREAK DOWN BUT IT TO ANSWER THE LATTER PART OF YOUR QUESTION IS THAT- IT REALLY IS INTENDED TO REDUCE CASELOADS. AND THEN TO HAVE A PORTION OF IT THAT IS BEEN EARMARKED SPECIFICALLY FOR INCENTIVES OKAY SAID. YES OKAY SO THAT'S A GREAT THAT THEY DOES ON THE CLIFFS IT WHICH MEANS THAT THE PORTION OF IT. IS NOT REALLY CALLED AND SENT IT IS TO LITERALLY. GET THE CASELOAD DOWN SO AND THEN THIS OTHER PORTION THAT'S ACTUALLY BEING USED AS THE INCENTIVES PORTION SO THAT DOES ALL OF THAT. DATA ACCURATE CORRECT. THAT'S ACCURATE OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE. ALL RIGHT SO LET'S MOVE ON AND ISSUE NUMBER FIVE OF ILIO IT WAS CONSIDERED WARY DALY- DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING ON THIS ONE ARE SORRY. WE DO AND IF I HAD A PERMIT FRANCE WANTS TO GO FIRST THAT'S I'M FINE WITH THAT TOO. OF THEIR FIVE FIRST SINCE I UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE WILL BE RESPONDING TO THANK YOU. CHRIS ARNOLD APARTMENT PLANES ARE ACTUALLY NOTHING FURTHER AT. I THINK. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NOT INSURED AND MEMBERS AND WE HAVE A FEW COMMENTS ON THIS PROPOSAL SO WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE MERITS OF A PROTECT THE POTENTIAL MERITS OF A PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM WE DO NOT THAT THE GDS SYSTEM STILL HAS THE SAME THREE FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES THAT COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS WITH THE PERFORMANCE BASED INCENTIVE PROGRAM. THE FIRST IS OUTDATED SERVICE PROVIDER RATE SEVEN OVERLY COMPLEX RATE STRUCTURE. THE SECOND WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED OR THE SERVICE COORDINATOR CASELOADS THAT ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH STATE STATUTE AND FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. AND THEN THE THIRD ISSUE WE- IT THAT YEAH CHALLENGES THE SYSTEM IS A LACK OF- GOOD DATA AND DATA SYSTEMS AND THE ABILITY TO REPORT. ON OUR ON REPORT INFORMATION ON A REGULAR BASIS. SO WE KNOW THAT THE PROPOSAL AS DISCUSSED WILL BEGIN TO ADDRESS CASELOAD RATIOS BUT IT WOULDN'T DO THIS UNTIL- TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND WHILE WE DO UNDERSTAND THE DDS HOPES TO LINK. ANY NEW REGIONAL CENTER OPERATIONS FOR. TO THE NEW LEADER- PERFORMANCE. WE ALSO THAT LET'S CONTINUE GROW AND- HAS AN IN. ON THE CAN SIR- AND TO. IS THAT THE SHORE. OF SERVICE CALL. MAYBE IS HIS HUNDRED AND SIXTY. A RED THAN THIS HUNDRED PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED- IT AND THAT'S IN TURN OF- WHAT STATURE AND REGULATIONS REQUIRE. THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER ALLOCATING SOME OF THE FUNDING THAT'S PLANNED FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE IN THE BUDGET YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE SERVICE COORDINATOR SHORTFALL EVEN WHILE RETAINING A PORTION FOR THE INCENTIVE SCHEMES THAT WOULD NOT START UNTIL THE FOLLOWING YEAR. AND WE THINK THAT THE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS DEVELOPED THE FOLLOWING YEAR COULD THEN BE APPLIED TO THESE NEW HIRES EVEN IF THE HIRES TO PLACE THE PREVIOUS YEAR- THE OTHER THING THAT WE WOULD WANT TO POINT OUT IS- EDS DATA SYSTEMS ARE CURRENTLY FAIRLY BRITTLE AS WE UNDERSTAND THEM AND LIKELY CANNOT SUPPORT SOME OF THE SYSTEMATIC DATA COLLECTION REPORTING THAT WOULD MAKE A PROGRAM LIKE THIS VERY SUCCESSFUL. WE KNOW THAT IN THE PROPOSAL DDS INDICATES THAT IT WILL BE TRYING TO IDENTIFY- NEW DATA COLLECTION SYSTEMS AND TOOLS IN THE FIRST YEAR- BUT THE LEGISLATURE YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE MADE THIS. RECOMMENDATION FOR SEVERAL YEARS SO APOLOGIZE FOR SOUNDING LIKE A BROKEN RECORD. BUT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER- A MORE ROBUST- DATA SYSTEMS OVERHAUL IN THE DDS SYSTEM NOT ONLY WOULD THIS HELP WITH THIS PROPOSED PROGRAM BUT IT WOULD ALSO HELP THE- LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION MAKE MORE INFORMED POLICY AND FISCAL DECISIONS WHEN IT COMES TO THE GDS SYSTEM GENERALLY. AND THEN THE LAST POINT THT I WANTED TO MAKE IS THAT- YOU MAY BE AWARE THAT WHEN THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. ACT WAS PASSED TO THERE IS A THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT BECOMES AVAILABLE TO STATES FOR THEIR- HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES THIS WILL BE SORT OF TEMPER A TEMPORARY. SORT OF ONETIME INFLUX OF FUNDING THAT YOU CANNOT SUPPLANT SIMPLY ON STATE FUNDING. AND WE'RE WE OUR OFFICE IS WONDERING IF SOME OF THESE PLANNING COSTS AND ANY SORT OF CHANGES TO THE DATA SYSTEMS MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE- EXPENDITURES. UNDER THE GUIDANCE FROM CENTERS FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES- FOR USE. OF THIS ONE TIME FUNDING. THE YOU VERY MUCH MANAGER. THANK YOU FOR MUCH- TO WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT THE MORE MONEY UP FRONT TO GET THE WE'RE CLOSER TO NINE HUNDRED STAFF THAT WE NEED RATHER THAN SIX HUNDRED AND IF WE'RE NOT IF WE'RE DOING ALL THESE A OUTREACH PROGRAMS. RIGHT THAT THAT'S THAT IS GONNA HOPEFULLY PEOPLE CAN BOOST COMING BACK IN THE SYSTEM WE CAN'T SERVE THEM. AND WE CAN'T MEET OUR CASELOAD NUMBERS NOW YOU CAN HEAR THE CONCERN AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO MEET EVEN MORE- THAN TO BE ABLE TO BUILD. THE FENCE FOR EXTRA MONEY CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO FRONT LOAD. I APPRECIATE DID YOU STAGING THINGS OUT.BUT IS THERE A CRISIS NOW THAT WE NEED TO MOVE MORE QUICKLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- SO. FIRST I WANT TO THANK ANESTHETIC FOR. REITERATING WHAT MY TESTIMONY WAS AS FAR AS THE REFERENCE TO THE PROTECTION OF THE NUMBER OF. COORDINATORS IF I SAID SIX HUNDRED I NEED TO CLARIFY THAT I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT- IS ACTUALLY OUR PRODUCTION- FOR- WITHIN THAT REQUESTED FIND DEAN IS ACTUALLY ESTIMATED ON- AROUND EIGHT HUNDRED- SERVICE COORDINATORS. SO IT ALL DEPENDS IT AGAIN ON KIND OF THE HIRING AND WHERE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE- BUT- I DID WANT TO MAKE THAT CLARIFICATION AS WELL- SO. WE DO WANT TO DO THIS RIGHT- AND I APPRECIATE- THE- ISSUES THAT WERE JUST RAISED- BUT WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE USE THE FIRST YEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE- ESTABLISHING A PROGRAM THAT. IS NEW TO DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND- CERTAINLY EVALUATING WHAT IS THE BEST INFRASTRUCTURE- PER PLATFORM- IT'S KIND OF THAT- FRAMEWORK AND PLATFORM FOR TRACKING AND REPORTING OUT- BUT THEN ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT MEASURES. WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE IMPLEMENTING THE OTHER POLICIES AND- PRIORITIES THAT WE- WE'VE PUT FORWARD- FOR IMPLEMENTATION- BEARS THE SERVICE COORDINATOR. AND HAVE SERVICE COORDINATOR RATIOS- ED CASELOAD FOR INDIVIDUALS HAVE ZERO OR NO POS- AS WELL AS SELF DETERMINATION- SO THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE ALSO ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT AS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD- I'M- SO. HAPPY TO ANSWER. ANOTHER THING ON THIS- THIS IS IT JUST THE COMMENT- THE FIRST YEAH THAT. EVEN THE NUMBER OF COORDINATORS THAT WE NEED GAS THAT- I WOULD THINK TECH DOING AT LEAST TRYING CLOSE SOME OF THE GAP OF AND- DOESN'T- IT PREVENT US DOING THE OF PLANNING WE NEEDS I'D I'M CAN ABOUT FACT THEIR LATEST ABOUT THE LAW GAS- BUT THE OTHER. IS A AGAINST ONCE AGAIN TALKING ABOUT I. T. SO YOU KNOW WE DURING TOTAL WE HAVE TO DEAL EACH AND I. T. SWEETS A CAR ABOUT HEALTH AND THE AYE. AND I'M HEARING ABOUT A BRUTAL SYSTEM. FOR D. AND- HAVING SOME SO- SO HOPE THAT WE CAN CONSIDER IF THERE ARE SOME. SO LEAST DO THAT ABOUT. OF THE I SAYS. AND FIGURE OUT WHAT MIGHT NEED TO DO TO MY- THE ITC.

MAKES MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO MAKE THE RIGHT POLICY DECISIONS AS WELL SO- SO I HOPE THERE'S SOME CONSIDERATION OF- EVALUATING OUR- EIGHTEEN NEEDS AND DD- AND BEING SURE THAT WE HAVE. THE APPIUS SYSTEMS AT LEAST INVESTMENT DOING THAT NOW. TAKE WITH THAT WOULD BE WHAT. STIFF WITH THE- FINE SO. PHONE SETTLED THANK YOU. THANK YOU YES SEVERAL.

THAT WOULD BE AN AND THEN ARE WE LOOKING ACT EIGHT CURRICULA- OR YOU SOME ON IS SIX- SO AS WE ARE LIKE AT OUR WE LOOKING AT A TWO YEAR LEVEL SO. OF TRAIN BECAUSE THAT WOULD ALLOW THE AND FOR END OF ALL VOLUNTEER TO THROUGH THE DIFFERENT YOU'RE A LOT THAN ANY EACH STAGE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE- AN INCREASE IN THEIR WAY- THAT WERE BE IT SHE AT EACH OF THOSE- SO THE FIRST CERTAINLY FIRST YOU WERE LIKE TO DO- A VERY TOUGH- AREA OF REALLY CENTERING. FOR WHERE WE'RE GOING INTO A THE SCOPE WHAT WE'RE FOR IN THE TRAY ANSWERED PROGRAM AS WELL AS TO BE ABLE TO TRACK THE STAFF THAT- HEY A THIS OF. OUR IN THE IS TO MAKE THAT THE END OF THE THIS PERSON WHO HAS THE THAT SORT OF. THAT SALARY JUST BUT THERE WITH THAT NO MATTER WHERE THEY WERE I'M IN WORK AND IN WHAT CAN THE DEVELOPER SERVICE SISTER SO WE ALL NEED HAVE A EIGHT AB OF. SHORTLY AFTER THE FISCAL. YEAR AND THEN BE ABLE TO DO THE REVIEW OF THE PROPOSAL CERTAINLY IN THAT TIME PERIOD WE WOULD ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS AND DISCUSSION- AND THEN ALSO TO HAVE A TARGETED DATE FOR LATE IN THE CALENDAR YEAR. AND L. I'M CERTAINLY NO LONGER THAN EARLY ON THAT- TWENTY TWENTY TWO THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THE- CONTRACT AWARDED TO THE WINNING- PARTICIPANT. OR THE- BETTER ON IT- AND BE ABLE TO- LATE IN THE FISCAL YEAR SO MAYBE THE FOURTH QUARTER- TO BE ABLE THAT HAVE- IMPLEMENTATION AND REALLY START HAVING INSURANCE THAT- STAFF FOR BEING ABLE TO PARTICIPATE. IN THIS NEW OPPORTUNITY AND THEN BE ABLE TO START MOVING FORWARD WITH- THE- DIFFERENTIAL. IN AND LOOKING AT THE CURRICULUM THERE'S A NUMBER OF STATES THAT ACTUALLY- OF MY COUNTERPRTS THAT HAVE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED COMPETENCY BASED TRAINING. AND SO THERE'S MANY OPPORTUNITIES WE ARE GOING TO PUT THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OUT- AND CERTAINLY THAT LIKELY BETTER COULD BE SOMEBODY THAT IS ALREADY PROVIDING A COMPETENCY BASED TRAINING THAT WOULD NEED TO THEN TAILOR IT SPECIFICALLY FOR CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE INCLUDING KIND OF THE CORE VALUES THAT WERE LOOKING FOR CULTURAL LINGUISTIC COMPETENCIES MAKING SURE THE PERSON CENTERED PLANNING- SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS WERE GOING TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IS INCLUDED IN TWO OF THOSE- COMPETENCY BASED TRAINING PROGRAMS. SO I'LL HIGH- NEW YORK MINNESOTA JUST TO NAME A FEW ALREADY HAVE SOME THEORIES- VARIOUS- COMPETENCY BASED TRAINING. AS WELL AS EVEN IN CALIFORNIA THERE SOME- DIFFERENT COMPETENCY BASED TRAINING CENTER ALSO IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE ARE NOT- LIMITING IT TO AN EXISTING THAT WE WOULD BE OPEN TO- OPPORTUNITIES FOR A NEW BUILD AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T DELAY IMPLEMENTATION. I'M SO HAPPY. TO ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DEPART FINANCE. YOUR DEPARTMENT NOTHING FURTHER ABOUT NOT. HELLO THANK YOU ANY PANIC L. A. O. AND WE THE NEW FOR PETRI- DURING SERVICE PROFESSIONALS WAS WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE RATE STUDY THAT CAME OUT A FEW YEARS AGO SO WE DON'T HAVE COMMENTS ON THE PARTICULAR MERITS OF THIS IDEA HOWEVER WHAT WE WOULD SAY IS THIS IS ONE ALONG WITH THE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM THIS IS THE OTHER MAIN PROPOSAL IN THE DDS BUDGET THAT HAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN FUNDING IN THE OUT YEARS RIGHT NOW THE- THE MAIN REVISION MATERIALS NOTE THAT IT WOULD INCREASE TO FIFTY ONE MILLION IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. HOWEVER WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THAT ESTIMATE WAS DERIVED WE HAVE REQUESTED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AGAIN WOULD SHARE THAT. SENATE COMMITTEE STAFF WHEN WE GET IT- BUT WHAT I WANTED TO POINT OUT. BY BRINGING UP THIS THIS POINT ABOUT THE FISCAL. ESTIMATE IS THAT- EVEN WITH THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN RIGHT NOW ABOUT HOW THIS TRAINING PROGRAM WOULD WORK AND HOW D. DS PEAS WOULD BE PAID DIRECTLY OUTSIDE OF THE SERVICE PROVIDERS RATE- SO ONE POSSIBILITY THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER. IS APPROVING ONLY THE REQUESTED FUNDS FOR PLANNING IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO YEAR. AND THEN REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION TO COME BACK- AB GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE TO SUBMIT. A MORE DETAILED- PROPOSAL FOR PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION FUNDS- FOR THE FOR THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU RESPECT SEEMS TO THAT HAS A ES MAKES SOME SENSE TO THAT- YEAH I WE KNOW THAT THINGS ARE MOVING VERY QUICKLY AND THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF DETAILS. ON SOME OF THE PROPOSALS RIGHT NOW BUT PERHAPS BUT NOPE NOBODY QUESTIONS THE NEED- BUT I THINK WE ALL JUST WANT THINGS TO BE AS SUCCESSFUL AS POSSIBLE AND SOMETIMES THAT CAN TAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME. SO THAT THAT IDEA HAS SOME MERIT LIKE LET'S GET THIS STARTED AND THEN. MAKE SURE THAT WERE ACTUALLY BEING EFFECTIVE AND HITTING THE OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR A DEPEND ANYTHING FURTHER ON THE STOCK. FOR ITS GOOD OKAY. I THINK AND WE WILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR WORK. TODAY WAS PARTNERS COULD SEE YOU. AND I WILL MOVE ON TO. THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT. I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE ACTING DIRECTOR AND CHIEF COUNSEL DAVID SCRIVNER. THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE MAY REVISED PROPOSALS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT- THE FIRST PROPOSAL CENTERS ON THE LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM ALSO REFERRED TO AS LIGHT HE- ALLY HE PROVIDES MORE CALIFORNIANS. ARE EIGHT TO HELP PAY THEIR UTILITY BILLS AND REDUCE THEIR ENERGY COSTS. CST IS SEEKING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ACTUATE THE BETTER UTILIZATION OF SUPPLEMENTAL LIGHT HEAT FUNDING APPROPRIATED UNDER THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THESE FUNDS WILL BE USED TO ADDRESS ENERGY UTILITY RARITIES ACCRUED BY LOW INCOME FAMILIES DUE TO AND YET THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS. OF THE CUPBOARD NINETEEN PANDEMIC THAT PROVIDE OTHER RELATED ENERGY SERVICES. CALIFORNIA HAS RECEIVED TWO HUNDRED THREE MILLION AND MARK SUPPLEMENTAL LIKE FINDING THIS FUNNY DOG MATCHES WITH REGULAR WHY HE FUNDING. AND IS INTENDED TO BE ADMINISTERED LIKE BY HE JUST WANNA MERGE THE BASIS THAT IT DOESN'T NEED AS A RESULT OF THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC. ECONOMIC GIVE THAT OF THE CUPBOARD NINETEEN PANDEMIC LED TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ACCRUING HISTORIC LEVELS OF ENERGY TO. THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION DATA MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE REPORT ONE POINT FOUR MILLION LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ARE BEHIND ON THEIR ENERGY BILLS. BUT TOTAL ARREARS OVER SIX HUNDRED MILLION. AND WITH MANY OF THEM POTENTIALLY AT RISK OF LOSING ENERGY UTILITY SERVICES DUE TO NON PAYMENT. THE PROPOSAL ALLOWS U. S. B. TO SUSPEND SPECIFIED CODE SECTIONS IN ORDER TO DEVOTE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF SUPPLEMENTAL LIGHT FUNDING APPROPRIATED UNDER ART. TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL SYSTEM PAYMENTS FOR A WHOLE ENERGY- HELP LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS MANAGE THE REPAYMENT OF HISTORICALLY HIGH ENERGY BILL ARREARS. UNDER THE GOVERNMENT COAT. SHE'S NOT REQUIRED TO ALLOCATE SPECIFIC PERCENTAGES OF WHY HE POINTED TOWARDS BERRIES PROGRAM ACTIVITIES INCLUDING UP 225% THE WEATHER'S ATION SERVICES. THE PROPOSAL GIVES YES THE POSSIBILITY TO ESTABLISH PERCENTAGES THAT WILL BE ALLOCATED TO UTILITY ASSISTANCE AND WEATHERIZATION BEST. MEET THE NEEDS OF MORGAN CALIFORNIANS. THIS LANGUAGE MIRRORS A SIMILAR WAIVER GRANTED BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM EXECUTIVE ORDER AND DASH SEVENTY TWO DASH TWENTY THAT APPLIED TO THE FORTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION A SUPPLEMENTAL LIKE HE FUNDING CST RECEIVED UNDER THE CARE ACT. THE SECOND PROPOSAL THIS FOR THE LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLD WATER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM ALSO REFERRED TO AS LIGHT WALK. THE PROPOSAL GIVES YES GIVE FORTY TO ADMINISTER THE NEWLY CREATED FEDERAL LOW INCOME WATER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. LIVE UP WILL PROVIDE ONE TIME FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH THE LOWEST INCOMES THAT PAY A HIGH PROPORTION OF HOUSEHOLD INCOME FOR DRINKING WATER AND WASTEWATER SERVICES. ASIAN WIDE CONGRESS APPROPRIATED A TOTAL OF ONE POINT THREE BILLION FOR THE FEDERAL WATER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WELL NO GRANT FIGURES HAVE BEEN RELEASED BY THE US DEPARTMENT HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES. CST ESTIMATES CALIFORNIA'S A PREPARATION TO BE IN A RANGE OF EIGHTY TO NINETY MILLION. FORTY ONLY FINANCES PUT A PLACE HOLDER IN THE BUDGET FOR NINETY MILLION. US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES HAS ADVISED THE STATE SO THAT LIGHT WALK WILL CLOSELY FOLLOW STATUTORY AND REGULATORY GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED FOR LIGHT HEAT. AND IN RESPONSE GOVERNOR NEWSOM IDENTIFIED CST IS THE DESIGNATED AGENCY TO ADMINISTER A LIE WALKING CALIFORNIA. CST IS COORDINATED WITH THE STATE WATER BOARD NCPC TO PREPARE FOR THE DELIVERY OF WHY WHAT FUNDING. WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH OUR STATE PARTNERS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AS WE DEVELOP ALLY WHAT STATE PLAN. FINAL PROGRAM DESIGN AND REQUIREMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN RELEASED BY THE US DEPARTMENT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BUT CSP IS INFORMED IT WILL BE HIS BILL WOULD BE BASED LARGELY IN PART. ON WHY HE- TIMELINES FOR EXPENDITURE OF NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED BY FEDERAL OFFICIALS BUT SIXTY IS FOCUSED ON IMPLEMENTING WHAT I WALKED IN DELIVERING WATER RATES SERVICES TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY. I PARTICULAR THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL QUESTION FOR ALL I WANT IN THAT THE TRAILER BILL ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLD WATER PROGRAM INCLUDES OR ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT TO DEVELOP A STATE PLAN REQUIREMENTS AND GUIDELINES. WITHOUT TAKING REGULATORY ACTION. AND THE QUESTION CENTERED ON WHAT WAS THE RATIONALE FOR THIS EXEMPTION FROM DEVELOPING REGULATIONS. THE DEPARTMENT ALSO ALLOW UP IS BASED ON A ONE TIME FUNDING AND ACCORDING TO THE US DEPARTMENT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WILL BE CLOSELY MODELED ON LIFEKEEPER PROGRAM THAT CSU ALSO WILL MINISTERS. OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STILL WAITING CONCRETE GUIDANCE FROM HHS OF WHAT SPECIFIC ELEMENTS LIKE IT WILL BE APPLIED TO WHAT I WANT BUT AT A MINIMUM SAYS HE DOESN'T KNOW. THAT OUR STATE PLAN FOR WHAT I WANT BUT WILL BE NECESSARY AND THROUGH THAT STATE PLAN THERE'LL BE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC INPUT. BEFORE. SUBMITTAL TO THE FEDERAL OFFICIALS FOR APPROVAL. SHE'S THE PLANS ON. WITH IN THE LEGISLATURE IT DEVELOPS THE STATE PLAN AND PROGRAM IN THE DESIGN AND A RELEASE TO THE FEDERAL OFFICIALS. WHILE THE DEPARTMENT IS NOT RULING OUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF REGULATIONS FOR LIVE UP INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL MODIFICATION OF LUCKY BREAKS DEPENDING ON THE FEDERAL GUIDANCE. BUT IT DEPARTMENT DOES FIND ON BALANCE BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED NATURE OF THE PROGRAM ITSELF THE STATE PLAN PROCESS MEANING REQUIREMENTS SIMILAR TO THE REGULATORY PROCESS. AN EXEMPTION CAN HELP EXPEDITE THE DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY TO DELIVER LIVE WHAT FUNDED SERVICES TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. FINALLY THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE ALSO INCLUDES A BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR CST TO ADMINISTER A NEWLY CREATED CALIFORNIA RESEARCH PAYMENT PROGRAM. A PROPOSED ONE BILLION FROM THE STATE'S ARBELLA CATION WILL BE USED TO ESTABLISH THE CALIFORNIA RICH PAYMENT PROGRAM FOR CAP. OFFERING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS RELATED TO THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THE CODE NINETEEN THAT DEVON. AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED OVER ONE POINT FOUR MILLION I'LL YOU LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ARE BEHIND ON THEIR ENERGY BILLS- IN ROUGHLY SIX HUNDRED MILLION. THESE LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ARE POTENTIALLY AT RISK OF LOSING ENERGY UTILITY SERVICES. SIXTY ALSO PRESUME SIMILAR TRENDS WITH ACCUMULATED ENERGY UTILITY DEBT AND PAYMENT DELINQUENCY EXISTS WITHIN PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY SERVICE AREAS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BASED ON THIS PRESUMPTION CST ESTIMATES THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ENERGY UTILITY CUSTOMERS IN ARREARS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN WHAT HAS BEEN REFLECTED IN CQC STATISTICAL REPORTING. CAP WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY CSP AND LEVERAGE THE EXISTING LIKELY MECHANISMS FOR PROVIDING FINANCIAL ENERGY ASSISTANCE. CAP IS DESIGNED TO MOBILIZE A STRONGER STATE RESPONSE TO THE ENERGY UTILITY DEBT LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS ARE CARRYING AND WILL EXPEDITE THE DELIVERY OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THESE CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS. BY WORKING DIRECTLY WITH UTILITY IT OVER WITH ENERGY UTILITIES TO IDENTIFY AND CREDIT THE ACCOUNTS OF LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS PRIORITIZE FOR KAPPA SYSTEMS. BY USING THIS METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION CAP BENEFITS CAN BE DELIVERED TO A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THE LIKE WHAT LOW INCOME CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS. VIA A SINGLE PAYMENT TRANSACTION. IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE MAJORITY OF LOW INCOME LOW INCOME CUSTOMER BENEFICIARIES WILL NOT NEED TO APPLY FOR ASSISTANCE. FOR CUSTOMERS IN AREAS WHERE UTILITIES ELECT NOT TO ADMINISTER KAPPA SYSTEMS DIRECTLY CSP PLANTS ARE PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE OUTREACH AND ENROLLMENT SERVICES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SIMILAR TO LIKE A- THE GOAL OF THE PROGRAM IS TO AID THE MAJORITY OF LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS FACING RAGES. AND HOW QUICKLY THIS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE REACHES VULNERABLE CALIFORNIA'S WILL ULTIMATELY DEPRIVED DEPEND ON HOW SUCCESSFUL. THE STATE AND ENERGY UTILITIES CAN WORK TOGETHER TO EXPEDITE THE DELIVERY OF BENEFITS. HE IS HE IS CONFIDENT THAT THE PART WILL BE ABLE TO DELIVER THIS RELIEF EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY TO HELP LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS KEEP THEIR LIGHTS ON AND THE HOME'S COOL COMFORTABLE AND SAFE. APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNDRED NINETY THREE POINT FIVE MILLION WILL BE DEVOTED TO LOCAL SYSTEMS. WITH SIX POINT FIVE MILLION RETAIN BY CSP FOR STATE APPROPRIATIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DEPARTMENT FINANCE. ONE ONE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU. DELEO MAJORITY CASHIER HAND. THANK YOU MANAGER ANGELA SHORT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE JUST A FEW BRIEF COMMENTS ON- THE THREE PROPOSALS THAT ACT ACTING DIRECTOR SCRIBNER JUST DESCRIBED- FIRST REGARDING THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WAIVES CERTAIN PROVISIONS FOR THE USE OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OR LIHEAP FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDED UNDER THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLANS. WE REVIEWED THAT LANGUAGE AND HAVE NO CONCERNS AND WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT- SIMILAR FLEXIBILITIES WERE APPLIED TO PREVIOUS FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDS FOR LIKE HEAT THAT CAME TO THE CARE ACT. GOING ON TO THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO PROVIDE AUTHORITY FOR CST TO DEVELOP AND ADMINISTER THE LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLD WATER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OR LIE WHAT- WHICH AS YOU HEARD IS A NEW PROGRAM SPECIFIED IN THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT ACTING DIRECTOR SCRIBNER JUST PROVIDED- IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION IN YOUR AGENDA CONCERNING THE EXEMPTION OF THE PROGRAM FROM THE REGULATORY PROCESS THIS IS THE QUESTION. WE HAD AS WELL. AND WE ALSO UNDERSTAND- THAT FEDERAL GUIDANCE FOR THIS PROGRAM HAS NOT YET BEEN FINALIZED AND MANY DETAILS HAVE YET TO BE DETERMINED FOR THE PROGRAM. SAID ONE THING THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER REGARDLESS OF WHETHER REGULATIONS ULTIMATELY ARE DEVELOPED FOR THIS PROGRAM. IS WHAT MECHANISM WOULD HELP ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAM ULTIMATELY IS IN LINE WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES TO THE EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY THE FORTHCOMING FEDERAL GUIDANCE. SO FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE COULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO NOTIFY- THE LEGISLATURE. OF THE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION PLAN- ALONG WITH THE PROPOSED ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY FOR THE FUNDING PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS- I GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK. IN ADDITION THE LEGISLATURE COULD REQUIRE REGULAR PROGRAM REPORTING FROM CST- THREE STATUTES. AND FINALLY ARE MOVING ON TO THE LAST ITEM ON THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL FOR THE CALIFORNIA RAGE PAYMENT PROGRAM FOR CAP- WITH A PROPOSED ONE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET FROM THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. WE ARE JUST NOW THAT THIS IS- A LARGE AUGMENTATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO BE SURE WE FULLY UNDERSTAND- THE PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TIME FRAMES FOR DISTRIBUTING FUNDS WHAT POSSIBLE OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE. AND OTHER TECHNICAL ISSUES AND WILL BE SURE TO FOLLOW UP WITH STAFF AS WE DEVELOP OUR OWN UNDERSTANDING ON THESE POINTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS SHORT AND- I THINK WE ALL WE ALL WANT TO MAKE SURE THE THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN HIT HARDEST BY THE PANDEMIC ARE ABLE TO- THEY HAVE THE RELIEF THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE OFFERING. ON SNAP SURVATION EVERY NEW PROGRAM IS A NEW ACRONYM- BUT I WILL ASK GUYS DOCTOR PULLED TO NOTE THAT. WE MAY WANT TO SEE THIS AGAIN BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION- AS WELL AS A- AS SOME ONGOING OVERSIGHT OF MAKING SURE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY WORKING BECAUSE- AS YOU KNOW WE OFTEN HEAR ABOUT THIS IN OUR COMMUNITY WHEN THINGS DON'T WORK. A SENIOR THEN THEN LATER- THAT WOULD BE MY COMMENTS ON THIS AND AGAIN WE ALL WE ALL WANT PEOPLE TO HELP. MEET THESE BASIC NEEDS OUT THERE- BUT WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS DONE MOST EFFECTIVELY- AND IT ALWAYS MAKES LITTLE BIT NERVOUS WHEN WE SAY WE NEED TO MOVE QUICKLY AND DON'T NEED REGULATIONS- AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. AB WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE F. THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES ARE GOING TO BE AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO MEET THEM. TECH PAN ANYTHING ON THIS- JUST I THINK THAT SOME OF THE WHAT YOU SAID- AT. THE REGISTER. FREESHEET THE NEED FOR FLEXIBILITY BUT ALSO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR OUTCOMES AND- SO. WITH THAT- HOPE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR TO OF WHAT YOU'RE- GETTING FEEDBACK. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER SCRIBNER- OKAY LET US MOVE ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING IS MISS CANACCORD THEIR DIRECTOR OF QUITE. YES GOOD AFTERNOON. ALL RIGHT ISSUE NUMBER.

FIVE ADULT DAY CENTERS AROUND THE STATE- AND THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO OUR WITH A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO APPLICATIONS OF OB PROVIDERS HOPING TO ADD.

AND APARTMENT FINANCING YOU CAN BE ABLE TO KEEP UP AND DO ALL THREE AT THE END OF WOULD YOU RATHER US BREAK THEM UP. OKAY HERE OKAY ALL RIGHT ROLANDE. THE PROPOSAL IS TWO MILLION. TO RETURN AGAIN TO CONGRESSIONAL REACH TO OLDER ADULTS. AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO ARE RECEIVING OUTSIDE WERE MADE ELIGIBLE COUPLE YEARS AGO FOR THE CALIFORNIA SITUATION PROGRAM TO HELP WITH GROCERIES. AGAIN WE'RE ALL VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE RISE IN IN ON NUTRITION NEEDS OF THAT WAS MADE MORE SEVERE BY THE PANDEMIC. AND THE COMING THROUGH CLICK THIS ON FEDERAL RESOURCES. AND SOME COPING RESOURCES AND SO GETTING MORE CLOSE CONNECTED TO CALFRESH. IS A PRIORITY. OF OURS AND OUR AGING NETWORK AND OF COURSE THIS WOULD BE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND OVERSEES THE CALFRESH. AND THE CALFRESH OUTREACH PROGRAM. THE PROPOSAL WHICH IS I'M ONE HERE'S OLDER DAY RECOVER AND WAS. FUND THIS IS A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN NEW FUNDING FOR- A LOCAL SERVICES AROUND THE STATE AS WELL SIX MILLION FOR STATE OPERATIONS. TO INVEST IN NINE DIFFERENT NEEDS. THAT WE HAVE SEEN GROW MORE INTENSE DURING. THE PANDEMIC AND I'M JUST GOING% TO TAKE A SECOND AND LIST THEM ALL. ONE SENIOR NUTRITION THIS IS FOR MEALS BOTH AT HOME AND AT COMMUNITY CENTERS AS WE SEE OLDER ADULTS RETURN WHICH IS STILL VERY MUCH. A WORK IN PROGRESS TO SENIOR LEGAL SERVICES DEALING WITH ISSUES FROM ADDICTION TO FRAUD TO ABUSE THAT HAVE- AGAIN BECOME MORE SEVERE. THIRD FALL PREVENTION. AND HOME MODIFICATIONS OF PEOPLE CAN LIVE IN THE HOMES OF CHOICE AND PROVIDE UP WITH THOSE FALLS WHICH ARE. ON THE NUMBER ONE INJURY CAUSE OF DEATH IN OLDER ADULTS PARTICULARLY OVER EIGHTY. OR DIGITAL CONNECTIONS. I KNOW THIS IS A SURE PRIORITY- WE KNOW FROM OLDER ADULTS WHO WERE ABLE TO BE ONLINE DURING THE PANDEMIC IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE WHETHER CONNECTIONS YOUR TELEHEALTH. TO LOVED ONES TO CONGREGATION SERVICES TO ALL KINDS OF CONTENT- AND SO WE WANT TO DO MORE TO PROVIDE ADVICE IS PROVIDE BROADBAND AND PROVIDE IT SUPPORT. TO HELP PEOPLE GET AND STAY CONNECTED. NUMBER FIVE A SENIOR EMPLOYMENT TO HELP MORE ADULTS WHO BOTH NEED TO AND WANT TO WORK- GET THE TRAINING AND SUPPORT TO DO SO. PERSONS ARE RUN DOOR AGING INTO THE- RESOURCE CONNECTS AS WELL ALLOW US TO EXCEL EVEN. THAT HAAB FOR PEOPLE TO. IT FOR ON THE TO. GET THAT PERSON CENTERED CARE PLANNING CARE. IN CONNECTION TO COMMUNITY SERVICES HEALTH SERVICES COUNTY SERVICES. TO HELP YOU PRIVATE HOME. SEVEN IS OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FRIENDSHIP LINE WHICH WERE BOTH PROUD AND ALSO A QUITE QUITE- MOVED BY THE FACT THAT IT CONTINUES TO RECEIVE HUNDREDS OF CALLS A DAY. FROM OLDER ADULTS LOOKING TO OUR REACH OUT AND HAVE A CHAT AND HAVE A CONVERSATION AND AVOID LONELINESS WHICH IS- SO PERVASIVE. EIGHT FAMILY CAREGIVING SUPPORT WE HEAR ALL THE TIME AND- PERHAPS SOME OF US HERE A FAMILY CARE GIVERS WHO HAVE HAD BOTH THE PRIVILEGE YOU CAN'T- THE STRESSORS OF CARING FOR OUR LOVED ONES DURING THIS TIME AND SOME MORE SUPPORT ARRESTED IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS- AND THEN LAST BUT NOT LEAST ON COUNCIL THAT WAS CALLED FOR IN THE MASTER PLAN AGAIN BREED TOGETHER ALL THE MANY STATE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES ARE COUNTY AND FEDERAL PARTNERS OR STAKEHOLDERS TO REALLY MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING ALL WE CAN TO PREVENT. I WAS NOT A FACTOR COOLEY AND WITH AN EQUITY LENS TO ABUSE NEGLECT FRAUD AND EXPLOITATION. ABOUT PACKAGES- THE HUNDRED MILLION A ONE TIME OVER THREE YEARS TO REALLY BE THAT RESPONSE ON AND INVESTED. RECOVERY RESILIENCY AND COME BACK. THERE WERE QUESTIONS I SPEAK TO THAT WOULD HOOKED. PLEASE A PROBABLY. MY QUESTIONS GOING TO BE A- HOW ARE YOU CAN BE WORKING THE CHARACTER. REESE CENTERS THAT ARE ALREADY KIND OF OUT THERE DOING SOME OF THIS WORK WITH THE COORDINATION AND YES. THEY ARE- CORE PARTNERS OF OURS- TO BE SURE. SO WE HAVE THIRTY THREE AREA AGENCIES ON AGING. AND ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THEM- RIGHT INVESTOR CAREGIVER RESOURCE CENTERS WITH THE CAREGIVER RESOURCE CENTER SO IN SACRAMENTO AND SAN JOAQUIN FOR EXAMPLE THEY ABSOLUTELY ARE WORKING WITH THE DELL'ORO. CAREGIVER RESOURCE CENTER. OTHERS MONIES OTHER USED THEIR FUNDS FOR THINGS LIKE ADULT DAY SERVICES WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. ALZHEIMER'S SPECIFIC DIMENSIONS SUPPORT SO THERE IS A NEED FOR BOTH THAT COMBINATION OF PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CAREGIVERRESOURCE CENTER CITY ACS AS WELL AS SOME LOCAL FLEXIBILITY. BUT THE MAJORITY OF OUR- TRIPLE A.'S AND R. DOLLARS ARE- IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. DEPARTMENT FINANCED YOU HAVE ANY. ON ANY OF THE THREE PROPOSALS. THERE WAS A FINANCE NOTHING THAT AT THIS TIME THANK YOU OKAY LMAO ANYTHING ON THESE THREE PROPOSALS AND MAYBE THE LAST ONE MOST SUSPECT ESPECIALLY. THAT'S TRYING TO PROCEED WITH THAT LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE AS FOR THE FIRST PROPOSAL RELATED TO SEE BASS OUR COMMUNITY BASED ADULT SERVICE SAYS- IN GENERAL WERE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THE BCP BUT AT THIS TIME NO MAJOR CONCERNS A BROADER POINT THOUGH I'D LIKE TO RAISE. THAT WE DID MAKE AND- JANUARY WAS OUR OFFICE I'M GLAD FOR THE LEGISLATURE THAT IT MAY WANT TO CONSIDER MAINTAINING- TEMPORARY CODE NINETEEN PROGRAM CHANGES THAT NOW LOOKING BACK MAY HAVE IMPROVED PROGRAM ACCESS OR PROGRAM OUTCOMES. AND WE KNOW THAT IN THIS AND SEE BASS IN PARTICULAR I'M PROGRAM CHANGES WERE MADE IN WHICH RECIPIENTS COULD RECEIVE SERVICES IN HOME ORTON DOORSTEP- BUT ALSO VIA AND TELEHEALTH- AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE CONGREGATE CENTER. ARMS OF THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED- MOVING FORWARD AND LEARNING FROM CALL THE NINETEEN AND ADOPTING SOME OF THOSE PROGRAM PRACTICES I'M COS AS A POSSIBLE AREA IN WHICH THE LEGISLATURE COULD REQUEST ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON HOW SUCCESSFUL WERE THOSE PROGRAM FLEXIBILITIES TO WHAT EXTENT. ARE ARE THEY POSSIBLY NEEDED IN A POST COLD IN NINETEEN WORLD- AND WHAT WOULD IT COST- TO MAINTAIN THOSE FLEXIBILITIES MOVING FORWARD- FOR ISSUE NUMBER TWO RELATED TO- CAL. ADDITIONAL DOLLARS FOR CALFRESH. OUTREACH WITHIN THAT TROUBLING NETWORK WE WERE JUST FLYING THAT THIS GENERALLY ALIGNS WITH PRIOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION TAKEN A FEW YEARS AGO WITH THE BROADER EXPANSION OF CALFRESH WHEN IT CAME TO THE US ISIS P. POPULATION. AND ESSENTIALLY TRIPOLI'S WERE GIVEN ONE TIME DOLLARS TO DO CALFRESH OUTREACH- SO THIS PROPOSAL ESSENTIALLY IS RESTARTING THOSE REACH ACTIVITIES. THAT WERE DONE IN THE PAST. AS FOR THE THIRD PROPOSAL THE OLDER WERE. AND RESILIENCY PACKAGE. ONE THING THAT WE WOULD NOTE IS AN AREA IN WHICH- THERE WAS A LINE MEANT RELATIVE TO ACTIONS TAKEN- LAST WEEK OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE IT WAS. OF THE SUSPENSION OF THE ELIMINATION OF THE SUSPENSION LANGUAGE TIED TO THE EIGHTY OR SEEN SENIOR NUTRITION FUNDING. SO WITH THAT THESE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS PROPOSED UNDER THIS BROADER PACKAGE WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO THAT NOW PERMANENT BASE FUNDING FOR THOSE TWO PROGRAMS- BUT A BROADER POINT TO. VERY MINOR TECHNICAL ISSUE THAT I WANTED A FLAG FOR THE SUB COMMITTEE IS THAT OUR OFFICE IS REVIEWING ALSO THE ACCOMPANYING- PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE ATTACHED TO THESE DOLLARS IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT- THE ADMINISTRATION DEPENDING ON PROGRAM MEANS OVER THE PHONE AND THREE YEARS IN WHICH THE DOLLARS WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FINDINGS AROUND- TWO DIFFERENT PROGRAM BUCKETS ARE LINE ITEMS I'M SORRY OFFICE IT WILL JUST LOOK AT THAT PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE TO SEE IF THERE. ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO- BUILD IN LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT SO WE'RE AWARE OF WHERE THE FUNDS ARE SHIFTING BASED OFF OF PROGRAM NEED AND DEMAND- IT ALSO IS SIMILAR TO WHAT WAS RAISING YOUR STAFF COMMENTS- WITH COLBERT NINETEEN WE DID SEE AN INCREASE AND SOME OF THE SERVICES WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING I THINK THAT BIGGEST EXAMPLE AS SENIOR NUTRITION- SO THERE IS A QUESTION OF. POST CALLED THE NINETEEN WHAT IS THAT ONGOING SERVICE NEED TO GET A LOOK LIKE AND I KNOW I'M PROGRAM PRIOR HEARINGS THE DEPARTMENTS WHEN IT CAME DOING TO KEEP A FOOT IN SECURITY THE FLAG JUSTICE TO STICK A FORK ON THE NINETEEN- ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND ELEVEN- EIGHT HUNDRED ELEVEN THOUSAND OLDER ADULTS THAT WERE FOOD INSECURE. I'M SO THE QUESTION IS WITH THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO WHAT EXTENT ARE WE MAKING PROGRESS AND MEETING ANY POTENTIAL UNMET NEED TO IMPROVE AND SECURITY AMONGST OLDER ADULTS BUT THEN ALSO ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE STATE DID RECEIVE ONE TIME FEDERAL DOLLARS SOMEONE'S THOSE RANT DOWN- AND IT WAS THIS TEMPORARY FUNDING ALSO RAMPS DOWN WHERE IS THE STATE ACT IT WILL IN TERMS OF PERMANENT FUNDING LEVELS ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND MEETING THAT I MAY NEED AND THAT MAY THEN HELP THE LEGISLATURE. I UNDERSTAND IF I ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE NEEDED IN THE SPACE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT ANALYSIS INDICATED ONE MORE QUESTION FOR YOU IT IT'S. THEIR IS THEIR I. T. SYSTEM BRITTLE TO. AND OF TRYING PROGRAM OUTCOMES. DEFERRED TO- THE DE. I BEEN BROUGHT UP IN PRIOR HERE. ON EGGMAN AYE CHEER MEN- I CAN GIVE YOU THE GOOD NEWS BAD NEWS ANSWER THAT NO IT IS NOT REAL BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ONE SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE PROPOSING IS A CRM FOR OUR AGING I SHOULD SAY MORE ACCURATELY THE AGING NETWORK IS IN FOUR DIFFERENT C. R. ENDS OF THE STATE DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO. SO THE GOAL THAT WE ARE MOVING TOWARDS WITH THE NUMBER ON YOUR SYSTEM ALL MIGRATING TO A COMMON CRM THE INTEROPERABLE HAS INTER OPERABILITY WITH OUR MEDICAID PROGRAMS WITH OUR COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMS IN OUR CBO SO I KNOW WE ARE NOT BRITTLE BUT WE ARE NOT YET ANY UNIFIED PROGRAM AND- SYSTEM AND THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WILL BE DELIVERING WITH A NO WRONG DOOR INVESTMENTS I LOVE THAT. OKAY- THANK YOU THIS IS THIS IS A IMPORT AGAIN I YOU WERE. INTO WHO HAS NOT. EXPERIENCED A FLUSH OF RESOURCES IN THE PAST AND SO. TRYING TO PUT THEM TO THE BEST USE POSSIBLE. AND WE TALK A LOT ABOUT. ABOUT EQUITY AND- ISSUES AROUND OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR LGBT BUT ALL BUT I ALSO JUST WANT TO RAISE THE ISSUE THE LGBT COMMUNITY AND MAKE SURE. WE ARE REACHING THAT DEMOGRAPHIC AS WELL I HAD MY- MY FIRST. POST COOPER DINNER PARTY THIS THIS WEEKEND AND WE HAD SOME OF OUR- THE G. B. T. FRIENDS WHO ARE ARE- AT AT AROUND EIGHTY. AND I WAS JUST AMAZED. BY THE DIFFERENCES OF THEIR COVERT EXPERIENCE BASED ON THEIR FAMILIARITY WITH TECHNOLOGY- AND YOU KNOW MANY IN OUR COMMUNITY DON'T ALWAYS HAVE KIDS OR OR FOLKS AND- ONE COUPLE WHO LIVE FAR VERY. TECHNOLOGY THAT FLUID THEY THEY HAD. THE TOP LIGHT HOUSE TOURS AND COOKING CLASSES IN EUROPE ALL ONLINE. AND MY OTHER FRIEND JUST SAID IT WAS VERY VERY HARD ON ME AND HE DOESN'T HE DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS- SO WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE COMING OUT ON THIS OTHER SIDE ARE REALLY. GOING TO BE STRUGGLING. SO WE APPRECIATE THIS- THIS INFUSION AND- AND THE INTENT. TO PROVIDE MORE SERVICES AS WELL AS THE INTENT. TO GET ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS HARMONIZER THAT THERE WON'T BE A PROBLEM DOOR WHEN PEOPLE REACH OUT FOR HELP BECAUSE IT'S A IT IS A- FRIGHTENING TIME FOR MANY. OKAY BUT DEPENDING THING ON THIS.

HIS LANGUAGE ACCESS. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND DR PAN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE MY NAME IS MARK MEECHAN THE DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR PROGRAMMING FISCAL AFFAIRS AT THAT CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY I'M TO BE RELATIVELY BRIEF YOUR STAFF DID AN EXCELLENT JOB OF OUTLINING BOTH ARE INTENDED TO AND BACKGROUND- WITHIN THE AGENDA BUT I DO WANT TO SPEND A FEW MINUTES JUST HIGHLIGHTING. A FEW THINGS SO STARTING WITH THE LANGUAGE ACCESS PROPOSAL REALLY THE INTENT HERE IS TO AUGMENT OR ADDS TO WHAT WE HAD PROPOSED AS PART OF THE EQUITY CENTER PROGRAM PACKAGE AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET I TO REALLY LIFT UP OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT LANGUAGE ACCESS ACROSS THAT THE AGENCY OR TWELVE DEPARTMENTS AND FIVE OFFICES AND WHAT I WILL SAY HERE IS THAT THE GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENTS ARE TRANSLATING IN PROVIDING. IN LANGUAGE SERVICES TO VITAL DOCUMENTS THAT WE POST ARE RELEASED TO CONSUMERS AND FAMILY MEMBERS AND TO REALLY WORKING ACROSS THE AGENCY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THAT- WHAT I WANT TO REALLY FOCUS HERE ON IS KIND OF THE THAT WITH THE WORK THAT WE PLAN TO DO WITH THIS WITH THESE FUNDS FIRST AND FOREMOST LOOKING AT THE DOCUMENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY POSTED. ON OUR WEBSITE AND DOES THAT ARE TRANSLATED TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF WHICH WE NEED TO TRANSLATE ADDITIONALLY WE'RE NOT ONLY JUST FOCUSING AROUND THE TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENTS BUT ALSO LOOKING AT ORAL IN SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETATION SERVICES TO WEB CONTENT OR OTHER CONTENT THAT WE HAVE LOOKING AT ALSO LOOKING AT PERIODIC LANGUAGE NEEDS ASSESSMENTS TO DETERMINE THRESHOLD LANGUAGES FOR DOCUMENTS SO WE KNOW THAT THIS CHANGES TIME AND TIME AND SO REALLY BEING ABLE TO PERIODICALLY ASSESS AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE LANGUAGE ARTS WERE TRANSLATING IN ARE THE RIGHT LANGUAGES ARE AND WHETHER OR NOT WE NEED TO BE CHANGING AND THIS ALSO VARIES BY REGION OF THE STATE AND SO REALLY THINKING ABOUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. WE ALSO. WANTED TO KEEP THAT A TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT HOW WE- AND STREAMLINE INTERPRET. OF THE AGENTS. MANY OF OUR DEPARTMENTS AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTS AND SO THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE GAIN ECONOMIES OF SCALE. AND LEVERAGE THE STATE'S PURCHASING POWER TO DRIVE DOWN COSTS ON LANGUAGE TRANSLATION AND TRANSLATION SERVICES TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT- AND THEN I DO TO ADDITIONAL THINGS WHICH IS WHY DO QUALITY CONTROL MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT THE ACCURACY RELIABILITY. AND CULTURAL APPROPRIATENESS IS OF THE DOCUMENTS WERE TRANSLATING TO REALLY MAKING SURE THAT WHEN WE DO HAVE CONTRACTORS TRANSLATING THAT WE'RE ALSO. DOING SOME QUALITY CONTROL IN THE DOCUMENTS THAT WERE PUTTING OUT. AND FINALLY DOING SOME AB ROBUST ENGAGING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDER PARTNERS. TO ENSURE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT ON LANGUAGE ACCESS ACROSS THE AGENCY ACROSS THE DPARTMENT OUR COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS BOTH INDIVIDUALS WERE CONSUMERS OF OUR PRODUCTS BUT AS WELL AS- ASSOCIATIONS AND OTHER PARTNERS ARE IMPORTANT- ACT ASPECT OF OUR WORK CONSERVE REALLY ENGAGING WITH THEM. AND BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE HEARING HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THEM WORKING WITH THEM TO MAKE THOSE IMPROVEMENTS. THE MANAGER ALL PAS THERE I THINK THE ENGINE IT DOES A NICE JOB OF LAYING OUT THE PIECES AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS TO YOU OR OTHER MEMBERS HAVE. THANK. YOU VERY MUCH DEPARTMENT FINANCE ANYTHING. OTHER WORDS FARMING TO FINANCE SOMETHING. DEPARTMENT OF FARRER LU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SONIA PETTICOAT THE L. A. O. I WE JUST WOULDN'T KNOW WHICH THAT IMPROVING LANGUAGE ACCESS IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY GOOD AND IMPORTANT IDEA BUT WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL ITSELF SO THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL IN JANUARY WAS FOR THREE HUNDRED AND SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR TO LIMITED TERM POSITION IS TO DEVELOP A LANGUAGE ACCESS FREE MARKET POLICY FOR THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY THESE POSITIONS WILL BE LOOKING AT ISSUES SUCH AS LEGAL COMPLIANCE- SORT OF FIGURING OUT THE STANDARDS FOR BILINGUAL STAFF TESTING COMPLIANCE OTHER HR ISSUES AND ENGAGING. STAKEHOLDERS TO SORT OF DETERMINE LANGUAGE ACCESS NEEDS AND THE LIKE THE THRESHOLD LANGUAGES INSTRUMENT SHOULD MENTION I'M THE NEW PROPOSAL IS FOR TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TWENTY THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM POSITIONS ACROSS MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS AND FUNDING FOR VARIOUS CONTRACTS FOR INTERPRETATION TRANSLATION AND LANGUAGE SERVICES. SO WHAT OUR CONCERN IS AT THE MOMENT IS THAT IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT EACH OF THESE TWENTY POSITIONS WOULD BE DOING OR HOW MUCH THEY WOULD COST THERE'S BEEN A FACT SHEET PUT OUT- BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE SOME OF THESE DETAILS SO FOR EXAMPLE EVEN IF WE ASSUME THAT THE POSITIONS THEMSELVES COSTS MAYBE BETWEEN TWO AND THREE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IS SORT OF UNCLEAR WHAT THE REMAINING SEVENTEEN TO EIGHTEEN MILLION- HOW THE SET REMAINING SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN MILLION WOULD BE SPENT ON THE CONTRACTS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED BY MR LEACH. SO ONE OPTION THAT WE WOULD SUGGEST FOR WHAT IT THE LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION IS TO APPROVE A SMALLER AMOUNT OF FUNDING- IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET YEAR FOR SOME STAFF TO DEVELOP THE FRAMEWORK AS ORIGINALLY PLANNED AND THEN TO TARGET SOME RESOURCES TO THE OBVIOUS- YOU KNOW I'M SURE THERE WILL BE SOME OBVIOUS NEEDS R. FOR LANGUAGE ACCESS AND CHANGES. BUT THEN- THE LEGISLATURE COULD REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION TO COME BACK AT THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE GOVERNOR'S. BUDGET WITH A MORE DETAILED PLAN FRAZIER I SEEING THAT THAT REALLY KNOW THIS. OF LANGUAGE ACCESS TO CRY HEALTH AND SERVICES DEPARTMENTS AND PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE CERTAIN CLEAR JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THE PARTICULAR AMOUNTS REQUESTED. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS PATRICK- DIRECTOR I WOULD I WOULD. ECHO THAT SENTIMENT SOME WE WENT FROM UP A SMALLER SMALLER ASK THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO UP TO TWENTY MILLION- AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU MENTIONED WAS WANTING TO DO SOME MORE OUTRAGE WITH YOUR STAKEHOLDERS TO SEE- WHAT SERVICES WERE ACTUALLY REQUIRED. AND I KNOW DOCTOR PAN WILL ALWAYS SAY THAT WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TRANSLATION VERSES INTERPRETATION AND THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS AND AS WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT- TAXES AND REACHING OUT TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE WE HAVE TO KEEP THOSE KINDS OF THINGS IN MIND AS WELL- AND AS YOU KNOW WE ARE. NO OR VERY BIG STATE WITHOUT INCREDIBLY DIVERSE POPULATION. I CLOSE MY EYES AND I SEE MY COMMUNITY. AND I KNOW. MULTIPLE LANGUAGES ARE. ARE ARE USED ACROSS THE SPECTRUM SO. THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT I THINK NEED TO BE WORKED OUT BEFORE WE JUMP ALL THE WAY AND WE ALL AGREE. WITH THE EFFORT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE- BUT I THINK WE NEED TO ALSO THEN. MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ENGAGING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS. AND FOLKS SO WE ACTUALLY. GET IT RIGHT. WE'RE GOING FORWARD DR GRANT MEETING ON THIS. NO THANK YOU AND- FREESHEET. THE CAUTION- FROM THE LA- ALTHOUGH I WOULD ALSO PERHAPS MENTIONED THAT- DOESN'T TAKE A WHOLE YEAR TO DO THE EVALUATION AND THEN PERHAPS WE CAN DO IS THINK ABOUT- IS. THE HOT HOT BECAUSE THIS IS CERTAINLY AN URGENT NEED. AND A LONG STANDING NEEDS SO- SO. I GET THE PLANNING AND SO FORTH AND CERTAINLY THE CHANGE IN SCALE FROM ORIGINAL PROPOSAL BUT I ALSO THINK THIS NEW PROPOSAL DOES RECOGNIZE. THAT THERE ARE- THERE MANY OTHER ISSUES IN ADDITION TO WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY PROPOSED IN JUNE IN JANUARY AND APPRECIATE. THAT THE INVESTMENT LOOKING AT AT- SO I JUST WANNA THINK IN TERMS OF. ONE TIMELINE HOW LONG DO WE NEED TO DO THE PLANNING PART WE CERTAINLY NEED TO DO THAT BUT THEN IS IT. ARE YOU A BILL MOVE EARLIER THAN ONE WHOLE FISCAL YEAR- THAT. PRECEDE THE FACT THAT WE DO TRY NEED MORE CLARITY KELLY HAS TWENTY SET TWENTY TWO POSITION SOCIAL SERVICES ONE PUBLIC HEALTH ONE D. EIGHT CSL DOES IS THAT REALLY THE RIGHT NUMBERS- WHAT EXACTLY ARE THEY DOING- BUT ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT I JUST NEED A FEW COMMENTS- IN TERMS OF- CAN WE TALK ABOUT THRESHOLD LANGUAGES OFTENTIMES RACIAL LANGUAGES ARE DEFINED. BY ABOUT PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO SPEAK THAT LANGUAGE IN THE GENERAL POPULATION BUT IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TYPE SERVICES- WE MAY ALSO A LOOK AT. PROPORTION OF PEOPLE SPEAKING THOSE LANGUAGES IN RICARDO SERVICES WHICH MAY BE A DIFFERENT. COMBINATION I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTES- IN THE API COMMUTE FOR EXAMPLE ARE. THEY FLYING PACIFIC ISLANDERS. AS WELL- IS ONE SIDE OF THE DISPARITIES- OFTENTIMES THEIR LANGUAGES DON'T HIT THE THRESHOLD SO- SO I WANTED TO BE SURE WE ADDRESS THAT ISSUE ABOUT WE THINK ABOUT THRESHOLDS. AS WELL AND THEN THE OTHER POINT IS THAT AND YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT DOCUMENTS AND SO FORTH. ARE THERE ARE STILL SOME LANGUAGES. IN WHICH THE MAJORITY POPULATIONS NOT IT'S REALLY MORE OF AN ORAL LANGUAGE THAN A WRITTEN LANGUAGE AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO. GET TO WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY. AND SO WE CAN PUT SOMETHING QUOTE UNQUOTE IN WRITING BUT IT MAY NOT BE THAT ACCESSIBLE IS A WRITTEN THAT YOU KNOW AND- IT. IT IT IT IT IS A WRITTEN LANGUAGE AND PER SE. AND- WHETHER THERE'S ALTERNATE REASON WEBSITE WHERE YOU ACTUALLY COULD. YOU KNOW PUT SHOULD. ACTUAL OR READING OF THAT BE MORE EXCESSIVE SO. BE ABLE TO DO SOME OF THAT MORE IN DEPTH WORK AS WELL- IN A DEFINED WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO COMMUNICATE AND CONVEY THE INFORMATION. TO PEOPLE SPECIAL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW THE SOCIAL THERE ARE. AROUND HEALTHCARE SOCIAL SERVICES SO FORTH WHERE. ALSO YOU KNOW- I GUESS READING LEVEL AND- LEVEL MAY HIM ALSO BE BARRIER AS WELL LANGUAGE. AND UP WITH- LEADERS- BE SURE TO WE'RE- PUTTING BOTH IN LANGUAGE ALSO THE RATE YOU KNOW. A LITERACY LEVEL. FOR PEOPLE TO BE TO CONNECT AND FOR ACTOR. AND OF COURSE FEEDING BACK TO COMPETE WITH ALL HAD STORIES ABOUT. WERE SOMEONE OUT AND- A CHECK. THANK YOU PEOPLE IN THE- RE IT KNOWS VERY. THAN. AT THE START THIS EFFORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT MOVING ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE LEADERSHIP. SURE MADAM CHAIR THIS IS MARK ME CHICKEN WITH THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY IN HERE AGAIN I THINK YOUR STAFF DID A EXCELLENT JOB AND KIND OF OUTLINING AND THE PIECES IN THE INTENT. OUT WHAT I WILL JUST HIGHLIGHT HERE IS THAT THE IN THE IDEA IS FOR US TO THE FUNDING REQUEST IS FOR RESEARCHERS AT THE STATE LEVEL TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO BEGIN TO BUILD OUT ADDITIONAL LEADERSHIP- AND ENGAGE WITH THE STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY AROUND HOW WE EXPAND THE USE OF. THE EXCHANGE OF-DATA BOTH ON THE HOUSE SIDE AND THE HUMAN SERVICES SIDE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES AND OVER THE PAST DECADE BOTH WITH HIGH TECH AND ARE ACTUALLY MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN BUILDING WHAT I WILL CALL THE ROADS- THE PIPELINE OF THE EXCHANGE OF DATA WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW IS GET MORE FOLKS ON THAT RELY ON THOSE ROADS OR WITHIN THOSE PIPELINES. AND THINK ABOUT WHAT STANDARDS AND FURTHER INCENTIVIZED- THE USE OF THE SHARING OF DATA AND INFORMATION AMONGST DIFFERENT PROVIDERS AND DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE MOST VULNERABLE AND AT RISK INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA. THE GOAL HERE REALLY IS TO COUPLE DATA TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUALS WERE SERVING BUT ALSO UNDERSTAND WHAT SERVICES THEY ARE ACCESSING AND HOW WE CAN FURTHER SUPPORT- THAT THEIR- THEIR AXIS OF ADDITIONAL SERVICES IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS THAT WE MAY BE DOING AND THIS IS WHAT I WILL CLARIFY HERE IS THAT. THE INTENT HERE IS NOT TO JUST FOCUS ON THE EXCHANGE OF DATA AMONG STATE ENTITIES ALTHOUGH THAT'S IMPORTANT BUT IT'S A LINE OF EFFORT THAT WE'VE EMBARKED ON OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND THAT THE HIS HIGHLIGHTED- THE URGENCY OF IT UNDER THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. BUT THE INTENT HERE REALLY IS LOOK AT HOW DOES A COMMERCIAL MARKET AND PRIVATE BY PROVIDERS AND ORGANIZATIONS REALLY EXCHANGE DATA WHAT STANDARDS DO WE AS A GOVERNMENT SAT ON THEM IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL STANDARDS THAT ARE BEING PUT FORWARD. TO BE ABLE TO ACCELERATE THE EXCHANGE OF DATA. IN A MORE HOLISTIC WAY SAW BECAUSE THERE ANY ANSWER ANY. YOU MAY. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT FINANCE. TIGER WOODS FINANCED NOTHING FURTHER THANK YOU OKAY MISTER WHICH I'M GONNA IF I DON'T SEE YOUR HAND ABOUT A STOP CALLING ON YOU FOR AWHILE OKAY. SOUNDS GOOD THANK YOU ALL RIGHT MISS PANIC. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CINEMATIC WITH THE L. A. OKAY AND- THEN THE IDEA IN THIS PROPOSAL SCENE YOU KNOW IT REALLY APPEARS TO IT TO MAKE SENSE BUT WE'RE STILL REVIEWING. THE PROPOSAL AND I WANT TO CONSULT WITH SORT OF OUR L. A. I. T. EXPERT BUT WELL YOU KNOW IF WE SEE ANY RED FLAGS OR ANYTHING WILL BE SURE TO CONTACT THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE STAFF BUT- AS IT. AS IT AS IT LOOKS I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL. OKAY MOST READ IT CAN YOU CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TIMELINE I DON'T SEE ANY TIMELINE- NUMBERS ABOUT HOW. HOW SOON ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS ARE YOU ANTICIPATING THIS. WITHIN THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR OR WHEN ARE YOU ANTICIPATING THAT. THIS ALL ALL THIS WILL BE DONE AND READY TO READY TO GO. DISCORDANT EXPECT. THE INTENT. IS TO GET WORKING ON THIS WE'VE ACTUALLY BEGUN LAYING THE GROUND WORK IN TERMS OF. ACT CONVENING INTERNALLY AND BEING ABLE TO MAP OUT KIND OF WHAT ROLE WE AS A GOVERNMENT ENTITY PLAY WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE BIDEN MINISTRATION IN THE FEDERAL- AND SEE. AROUND STANDARDS OPINION TEND TO ISSUE SO WE'VE ALREADY STARTED I WILL SAY THAT I THINK THE GOAL IS TO. HIT THE GROUND RUNNING AS SOON AS THE BUDGET ACT ASSIGNED TO BE ABLE TO BRING IN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THERE SOME CONTRACT RESOURCES THAT ARE WE'RE ASKING FOR- BUT THEN VERY SOON PROBABLY WITHIN. THE FALL PARAMETER CONVENE STAKEHOLDERS TO BEGIN TO MAP OUT HOW WE FURTHER ENGAGE. ON THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC. SO WAIT YOU CAN AND YOU'RE IN AND YOU'RE GONNA START UP THE PLAY VERY STARTED SOMEBODY GONNA START THE PLANNING AND THE ONE AFTER WERE TOGETHER INTERNALLY BEFORE YOU BEGIN TO MOVE EXTERNALLY SO TELL ME AGAIN WHEN DO YOU WHEN DO WE THINK IT'LL ALL BE DONE. SO I THINK THAT THIS IS AN ONGOING EFFORT I DON'T THINK AT NO POINT WILL WE EVER BE COMPLETELY TEN BUT THIS CONVERSATION OR THE THINKING AROUND HOW WE EVOLVE TECHNOLOGY CHANGES TO STANDARDS WILL CHANGE. SO I THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT WILL HAVE TO CONTINUALLY REVISIT. WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT IN THE FALL WILL WELL CONVENE EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS. OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS WHAT WE'VE BEGUN IS LAYING OUT. HOW WE THINK ABOUT THIS INTERNALLY WITH SOME OF THE DEPARTMENTS WITHIN OUR AGENCY. AND THEN LOOKING AT STANDARDS TOWARDS THE END OF THE BUDGET YEAR AND MOVING FORWARD. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS ONE TIME FUNDING THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO PROPOSE I THINK WE'LL COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE BASED ON THE STAKEHOLDER CONVERSATIONS. TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S ONGOING FUNDING NEEDED IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO ACCELERATE AND OR IMPLEMENT SOME OF THIS WORK. THANK YOU. TO DEPEND. THANK YOU. CERTAINLY APPRECIATE. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT WORK- WELL QUESTIONS I WANT ANSWERED THAT SKEWS IT IS THAT- WELL EXPLOSIVELY ON THE- ON THE SERVER ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE YOU KNOW WE'RE CREATING AND ALL CLAIMS PAYER DATABASE RUSSIFIED AND SO FORTH. I THINK ON THE CLINICAL SIDE ONE OF THINGS WE NEED TO DO IS THAT CERTAINLY IN ITSELF THE HEALTH INFORMATION SIEGES PORTENT BUT HE TALK ABOUT HOW THIS IS GOING TO HOOK INTO PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM SO FOR EXAMPLE- WE DON'T KNOW PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE- WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO SURVEILLANCE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO- YOU KNOW- DISEASE REPORTING- YOU KNOW WE THINK ABOUT DOING KODAK SCENES IN OUR VACCINE REGISTRY HOW THAT HOOKS UP AS WELL SO THERE'S- A POSSIBILITY OF EXCHANGE APPROPRIATE CHANGE OF DATA AS WELL TO SEND TO CERTIFY VACCINATION STATUS TO. IDENTIFY PEOPLE WHO STILL NEED VACCINES- AND BY LATE SUCH AS KODAK SCENES SO FORTH SO THERE'S A LOT OF DATA YOU KNOW IMPORTANT DATE AND I ONE THING I DON'T ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THOUGH IS ONLY TALKING ABOUT DISEASE SURVEILLANCE IT'S NOT JUST CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. FOR EXAMPLE- APARTHEID DEVELOP A STRATEGY TO ADDRESS CHRONIC DISEASES- THE ABILITY OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO BE ABLE TO INTERFACE WITH- CONNECT WITH A HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES TO THEN DO SURVEILLANCE ON FOR EXAMPLE RATES OF WHETHER IT'S DIABETES OR- CAL THE COPD HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE IT'S CETERA CAN BE ACTUALLY EXTREMELY VALUABLE. TO TO NOT ONLY THE STATE AND- AND BUT ALSO TO THIS- ORGANIZATIONS WELL TO HELP US. DEVELOP A MORE ROBUST. AB HEALTH AND- WE THINK OF BUILT IN. OF TYPES OF IN. AND ALSO TO FIND OUT WHAT THE RESULTS OUR INTERVIEW. ARE SO DO YOU THINK ABOUT A MODERN DAY PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM- THAT ABILITY TO DO THAT KIND OF- TO COLLECT THAT KIND OF SURVEILLANCE DATA IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL. AND THE WAIVER SO. THE WAY WE'RE GONNA DO IT'S NOT WHAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH GOING AROUND AND RE COLLECTING ALL THE DATA BUT HAVING SYSTEMS IN PLACE. THAT ALLOW THE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION IN AGGREGATE OR OTHER WAYS HEALTH COURSE OF CERTAINLY MAINTAINING INDIVIDUAL PATIENT PRIVACY BUT BE ON THE LOOK AT THINGS AND AGATES WITH INFORMATION COMING FROM OUR VARIOUS. NOW HEALTH PARTNERS RATE HOSPITALS HEALTH SYSTEMS PHYSICIANS OTHER PROVIDERS ETCETERA. AND SO BE SURE ARE THE INFORMATION SYSTEMS WE'RE DEVELOPING AS WE'RE TRYING TO DEVELOP THESE EXCHANGES. THAT ALSO INFORMATION CAN BE- THERE'S THAT THE SYSTEMS ARE DESIGNED IN A WAY THAT INFORMATION CAN FLOW- TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND EVEN BACK- BACK AND FORTH- SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT. TO TALK ABOUT YOUR SPOT ON- I THINK THAT. ONE OF THE EFFORTS AS PART OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH REVIEW AND CONDUCTOR GALLEY SPOKE OF THIS YESTERDAY- IN IN THE ASSEMBLY AND HE ALLUDED TO IT ALSO IN THE CONVERSATION THAT HE HAD WITH. WITH THIS COMMITTEE EARLIER IN THE WEEK IS REALLY ASSESSING THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS THAT WE CURRENTLY USE ON THE PUBLIC OUTSIDE. BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED IS THERE'S TWO PRINCIPLES THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED THAT I THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO LIFT THAT BAN IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO. I THINK- LEVERAGE HERE AS PART OF THIS CONVERSATION FIRST AND FOREMOST. ON THE PUBLIC OUTSIDE FROM A DISEASE SURVEILLANCEPERSPECTIVE WE'RE NOT ONLY FOCUSED ON INFECTIOUS OR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES LIKE COVERT NINETEEN OR ZEKE OUR MEASLES. BUT LOOKING AT THE CHRONIC DISEASES AS WELL AND WE HAVE A SERIES OF CLINICAL REGISTRIES THAT PROVIDERS LIKE YOURSELF REPORT INTO. THE CHALLENGE REALLY IS THE DATA THAT WE SENT BACK I SAY WHERE DATA RICH BUT INFORMATION POOR WE COLLECT A LOT OF DATA BUT WE DO NOTHING WITH THAT. EITHER WE DON'T PROVIDE IT BACK TO YOU AS A PROVIDER IN ORDER TO HELP FUEL YOUR POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT TOOLS OR OTHER EFFORTS AROUND HOW YOU. BASICALLY ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE POPULATION YOU'RE TRYING TO SERVE NOR DO WE USE IT IN A MORE ROBUST WAY TO THINK ABOUT POLICY OR PROGRAM CHANGES STERN FORMER THINKING. SO THERE'S TWO ASPECTS TO THIS ONE IS INCREASING THE CONNECTIVITY OF THOSE REGISTRIES. TO BE ABLE TO PUSH BACK THE INFORMATION TO THE PROVIDER. OR THE HEALTH CARE ENTITY IN ORDER FOR THEM TO HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THEIR PATIENT POPULATION LOOKS LIKE AND TRENDS THAT WERE SEEN. AS WELL AS THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN ORDER FOR THEM TO ENGAGE AFFECTED COMMUNITY LEVEL. BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR US AS A STATE COLLECTIVELY WITH OTHER PARTNERS TO THINK ABOUT HOW THAT FUELS PROGRAM DESIGNED POLICY DESIGN AND RESEARCH MOVING FORWARD TO HELP INFORM. CHANGES AND THIS IS WHERE I THINK OF BRINGING IN CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR ACADEMIC PARTNERS WE'VE BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS. AROUND A RESEARCH DATA HAVE REALLY NEDS TO LINK BOTH THE CALL. AND DATA WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT NOW WHEN RESEARCHERS GET OUR DATA WE DON'T REALLY LOOK AT RESULTS OR WE DON'T GET A SENSE OF WHAT THE RESULTS ARE. OF THE RESEARCH TWO THREE FOUR FIVE YEARS DOWN THE ROAD AND MOST OFTEN HAPPENS WHEN IT'S PUBLISHED IN ACADEMIC PAPERS CAN WE ACCELERATE THAT PARTNERSHIP AND BE ABLE TO. HAVE OUR STATE WORKFORCE CO CREATE WITH ACADEMICS TO BE ABLE TO IN REAL TIME GET A SENSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE DATA TO INFORM POLICY MAKING. IN ORDER FOR US TO IMPROVE THE DELIVERY OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AND THIS IS EXACTLY THE- KIND OF THAT THE ACADEMY OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS WORK WITH THE H. ID. SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND HAVING BEEN FORMALLY A FACULTY MEMBER AT- DINNERS THE CALIFORNIA DAVIS AND- DOING HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH SO I WAS ONE OF THOSE DATA PEOPLE. LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE LARGE DATASETS- BUT YOU GET SO I WOULD JUST SAY IS THAT- I HOPE. THAT AS WERE- DOING THE BUDGET WE HAVE STRONG SUPPORT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION FOR ACTUALLY- SO I KNOW YOU HAVE PROPOSALS FOR THIS COMING YEAR FOR LIKE THREE MILLION ON THOSE. C. P. H. AND HERE WE HAVE. TWO AND A HALF MILLION BUT THEN FORGOT REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT BUILDING OUT THE SYSTEMS TENWE SHOULD BE HAVING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS RESERVE HELD. BUDGETED IN DOUBT AND WHETHER IT'S LATER THIS YEAR IN THE OUT YEARS TO ACTUALLY BUILD THE SYSTEM SO WE CAN STUDY THEM BUT IF WE ARE NOT HOLDING RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO BUILD THEM OUT- THEN- IT'S A GREAT CONVERSATION BUT- AND WE DO HAVE BE GREAT ASSESSMENT. SO IS THAT THE INTENTION ADMINISTRATION THEN. CENTER I MEAN I THINK THAT TO DOCTOR GALLEYS POINT EARLIER THIS WEEK THE INTENT OF THE ADMINISTRATION IS REALLY TO LEVERAGE THE THREE MILLION ON THE PUBLIC OUTSIDE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS TO ASSESS THE GAPS AND BETTER UNDERSTAND. WHERE WE GO I THINK THE INTENT OF THE ADMINISTRATION IS TO COME BACK IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THAT'S PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO MAP OUT. IN MORE EARNEST SOME OF THE PIECES AND PUT FORWARD ADDITIONAL FUNDING REQUEST WHAT. AROUND THE SPACE THE ONLY THING I WILL ADD HERE IS THAT WE'VE MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS WITH FEDERAL DOLLARS BOTH THE ERC GRANT AND OTHER FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT WE RECEIVED. TO BUILD OUT THESE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS ON THE PUBLIC OUTSIDE I THINK THE CONVERSATION WILL BE AROUND HOW WE CONTINUE TO FIND SOME OF THOSE PIECES AND WHAT WE CONTINUE TO LEFT UP. THAT WE'VE ACCELERATED AND BELTS DURING THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. OKAY WELL LET'S WAS I HAVING BEEN. ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE FOR A FEW YEARS AND SEEN MANY IT PROJECTS I DON'T SOUND TOO MANY THAT- THAT WERE ONLY GET FOR A FEW MILLION- AND- SO I ALREADY KNOW YOU KNOW JUST FROM A SKILL STANDPOINT. I THINK YOU KNOW. IF WE'RE EVER BEING REALLY HONEST WITH OURSELVES. AND IS THIS A DEDICATION OF THE ABSENT AND ISSUES. IS MORE THAN JUST IDENTIFICATION W'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. THEN WE DO NEED TO THINK AS WE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE PASS A BUDGET A YEAR AT A TIME BUT IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT OUT YEARS. WE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE. CHECKED I COMMIT THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE KIND OF COMMITMENTS WE HAVE TO MAKE IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY FOLLOW THROUGH. AND WHILE WE MAY NOT KNOW THE EXACT AMOUNTS. I CERTAINLY- I CAN YOU KNOW THINK PAST EXPERIENCE CAN CERTAINLY TO HELP US ESTIMATE AT LEAST THE SKILL OF FUNDS THAT WE MIGHT WILL PROBABLY NEED TO. ENSURE THAT. WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE BUILDING IN TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN OTHERWISE WE'RE NOT BEING REALISTIC ABOUT IT RIGHT- SO I DEBTS. SO HOPEFULLY- YOU KNOW THAT'S PART OF THE CONVERSATION OUT AGAIN I THINK SIMILARLY FOR THE FIGHT TO SAVE THE PREVIOUS ITEM AS WELL I'M NOT SURE THE ASSESSMENTS NESTLE. TAKE A WHOLE FISCAL YEAR. I MEAN CERTAIN CERTAIN TO ME. DIFFER PIECES AND PARTS SO WE CAN ALSO GET A HEAD START ON SOME OF THE-THINGS. AS WE- TO GET. MOVING BUT I GUESS ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE I JUST WANNA BE SURE THAT AS WE'RE- BUILDING OUT THE STANDARDS AND- SO FORTH FOR OUR HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES WE ARE PUTTING BE SURE WE ESTABLISH STANDARDS THAT ALLOW US. TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS KIND OF SAID DISEASE SURVEILLANCE- CRYING DISEASE ETCETERA. THAT THOSE STANDARDS ARE GOING TO BE IN PLACE SO WE HAVE THE POSSIBILITY AND THEN WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THAT POSSIBILITY INTERNET REALITY WITH RESOURCES. AND WHETHER IT'S LATER THIS NEXT THIS FISCAL YEAR ARE. ARE NOW YOURS THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU- AND I. ANYBODY WHO HAS TO FILL OUT A LOT OF A LOT OF- FORMS AND DATA IT SOMETIMES CAN FEEL LIKE YOU'RE JUST YOU KNOW WEIRD WHERE DOES THIS INFORMATION GO ARE BEING REQUIRED TO DO ALL OF THIS AND I NEVER SEE IT BACK AND I DON'T SEE ANYTHING DONE WITH WHAT I PUT IN SO I THINK IF WE HAVE THAT MORE CIRCULAR FILE OTHER WERE ACTUALLY USING THE DATA THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR- I THINK YOU'LL FIND EVEN THE COMPLIANCE WITH EVERYTHING. WILL BEGIN TO GO UP SO THANK YOU AND TAKE SPECIAL NOTE OF- DOCTOR PANS SUGGESTIONS OKAY MOVING ON TO- STILL WITH M. SET TO THE ISSUE NUMBER ONE INCREASE INCREASED EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS.

REDUCING THE FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND GENERAL FUND ONGOING BEGINNING IN TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE I REQUEST RESOURCES WILL ADDRESS MISSION CRITICAL WORKLOADS SOCIALLY WITH INCREASED HUMAN RESOURCE WORKLOAD EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PERSONNEL SERVICES. INTO A STATISTICIAN RESOURCE DIVISION WITH THAT WITH AN ANZAC. PROVIDING HR SUPPORT FUNCTIONS IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS A HUGE UNDERTAKING AN EXTREMELY CHALLENGING. VOLUMES AS A SMALL DEPARTMENT FUTURE UNIT IS STILL TASKED WITH PROVIDING THE SAME STATE PROCESS PROGRAMS AND LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AS ANY OTHER STATE AGENCY. HR ANALYST IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS MAY ONLY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CLASSIFICATION PAY EXAMINATIONS ARE TRAINING BUT MS A SOLE HR. LIAISON IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE LIAISON SERVICES FOR ALL OF THESE TASKS IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING SUPPORT AND SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE IN MANY OTHER PROGRAM AREAS. PERSONAL NEEDS OF THE DEPARTMENT HAVE INCREASED PROGRAM EXPANSIONS WHICH INCLUDE NEW POSITIONS INCREASED RESPONSIBILITY BUT IT DESTROYS OUR STAFFING RESOURCES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED. THE STORE CLEAN ADMINISTRATIVE AND HUMAN RESOURCES WITHIN A SINGLE DIVISION ALL THIS COMBINED RESPONSIBILITY MIGHT BE MANAGEABLE FOR AN ORGANIZATIONAL MORE STABLE AND PREDICTABLE WORKLOADS MS IS UNIQUE IN THAT DEPARTMENT MANAGES PROGRAMS ENCOMPASSING ROUTINE ACTIVITIES WITH ANOTHER DISASTER MEDICAL SERVICES. IS DISASTER RESPONSE ACTIVITIES MAY AT ANY TIME EXPAND RAPIDLY WHICH CAN REQUIREMENTS ARE HIGHER LARGE NUMBERS OF EMERGENCY STAFF THIS CAN RESULT IN OTHER DIVISIONS PROGRAMS REDUCING OR SUSPENDING ACTIVITIES AND RE DIRECTING BOTH FRONT LINE AND MANAGEMENT STAFF TO HR FUNCTIONS. CONCURRENTLY WITH THESE DRAMATIC SHIFTS IN MS FOCUSES THE NEED TO RECRUIT ONBOARD AND MANAGE ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL IN PREPARATION FOR FUTURE EMERGENCY RESPONSE DEPLOYMENTS. THE NUMBER OF THESE EMERGENCY HIRES IS UNPREDICTABLE BUT THE TREND IN RECENT YEARS HAVE SEEN A SHARP INCREASE IN DURING THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE. THE NUMBERS OF BALLOONED EXPONENTIALLY. I THIS. THEM OF MY TO WEAR SIMPLY FORGO SOME HR FUNCTIONS. THIS INCREASED AFTER REQUEST WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO MEET MISSION CRITICAL HR ACTIVITIES AND TIMELINES. STRUCTURALLY MANDATED MANDATED REQUIREMENTS ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH BARBUDA GRIEVANCE AND THE CREATION OF OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES WITHIN THE HR DIVISION. ADDITIONAL POSITIONS WILL ALSO ALLOW THE HR DIVISION TO INCREASE CUSTOMER SERVICE LEVELS ARE VERY CENTRAL PROGRAMS WITHIN MS I BELIEVE MANY DELAYS IN RESPONSE TIME TO EXECUTIVE STAFF MANAGERS. ANOTHER CONTROL AGENCY REQUESTS AND REQUIREMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOTED RICHARD ADVENTURE OKAY- ISSUE NUMBER FOUR- STATEWIDE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES DATA SOLUTION. MS IS REQUESTING ONE TIME TEN MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND TWO POSITIONS THIS REQUEST WILL GO TOWARD PROJECT PLANNING FOR THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES DATA RESOURCE SYSTEM OR CEDARS UTILIZING THE STATE'S PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE AND TO CONNECT THE ADDITIONAL INTO CONNECTED DECISIONAL LOCAL EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AGENCIES TO AN EXISTING EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES NETWORK. OPPOSE CEDARS IS INTENDED TO CREATE A LINK TO VARIOUS SYSTEMS TO INCREASE DATA INTEROPERABLE IT BETWEEN HOSPITALS US AGENCIES AND OTHER HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS ENSURING CONTINUITY OF CARE TO CURRENTLY UNDER COVER AREAS OF THE STATE. THE PROMISE OF USING REAL TIME INFORMATION TO IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES TARGET SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS AND POWER STATE OVERSIGHT ACTIVITIES REMAINS A CRITICAL GOAL FOR CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER CALIFORNIA'S EMS DATA SYSTEM LAGS BEHIND IS HEALTH CARE PARTNERS THE ESSENTIAL ACTIVITIES RELATED TO STANDARDIZE DATA COLLECTION EXCHANGE REPORTING AND ANALYTICS. AND ANALYTICAL CAPABILITIES. IS CRITICAL THAT MEANINGFUL USE RESULTS OF DATA ANALYTICS ARE SUPPLIED OF LOCAL EMS AGENCY AND EMS PROVIDERS THE USE OF DASHBOARDS AND OTHER BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE TOOLS THROUGH STATEWIDE DATA ANALYTICS SUITE WOULD TURN DATA INTO INFORMATION AND INFORMATION AND ACTION. ALLOWING LOCAL EMS AGENCIES TO BENCHMARK THEIR ACTIVITIES AGAINST OTHER CALIFORNIA AGENCIES. TODAY HIM IN COUNTERS ARE CAPTURED. BUT THAT DATA REMAINS LARGELY USABLE ONLY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS LIMITED CONNECTIVITY OF THAT INFORMATION ITH OTHER PATIENT HEALTH INFORMATION VIA HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE AND THE STATE HAS NO ACCESS TO REAL TIME EMS DATA. THE TWO CURRENT SYSTEMS ARE WILL SERVE AS THE FOUNDATION FOR OVERCOMING THESE GAPS ARE KIM SAYS WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES INFORMATION SYSTEM AND HIGH TENS WHICH IS THE HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY YOU HAVE A SYSTEM. BY LEAKING THE SYSTEMS IT WILL PROVIDE A CENTRALIZED ACCESS. TO INFORMATION VITAL TO PATIENT CARE. ONE YEAR PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDING OF TWO POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS BEING REQUESTED FOR THE DESIGN OF A ROBUST AND SUSTAINABLE STATEWIDE DATA HELP LINKING KIM SYSTEM HIGH TENS. TO TRANSFORM MS CAPABILITY TO GATHER MANAGE ANALYZE AND REPORT CRITICAL EMS DATA. TO ACHIEVE THOSE ENDS REQUIRES A SUPPORT OF BOTH IN HOUSE STAFF AND CONSULTANTS SPECIALIZE IN ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT. SYSTEMS PLANNING AND ARE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS IN HEALTH CARE AND UMASS DATA. MS IS ALSO REQUESTING SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION TO ON BOARD ADDITIONAL LENDS US TO THE EXISTING HIGH TEN SYSTEM. VIA EXISTING STATE YOU CAN SEE OUR SYSTEM SOFTWARE AND CONNECT ALL H. I. USE IN A CHILD'S TO EMS DATA. CURRENTLY ONLY SIXTEEN OF THIRTY THREE LENSES ARE COVERED BY H. I. EASE AND PLUS YOU KNOW SYSTEMS. THIS LEAVES SEVENTEEN WHIMS OF OUR POPULATIONS BEHIND WITH REGARD TO QUICK ACCESS TO PATIENT INFORMATION DURING EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS. MANY OF THE- COVERED LENSES ARE ROLL ROLL OR HAVE LARGE UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. IN THE SIX TO CLOSE THIS GAP IN HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE BY CREATING CONNECTIONS IN THESE AREAS WHICH WILL INCREASE THE INTEROPERABLE YOU BETWEEN HOSPITALS EMS AGENCIES. ANOTHER HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS ENSURING CONTINUITY OF CARE. BETWEEN AND COVER AREAS OF THE STATE- MS OUR PLANS WORK TO NINE GRANT TO KIND ON BOARD INTEROPERABLE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE BETWEEN YOU MUST PROVIDERS AND YOU MUST RECEIVING HOSPITALS VIA. HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE ORGANIZATIONS AS A WILL BE PRIORITIZING THESE GRANTS TO NINE COUNTIES THAT HAVE NOT ALREADY IMPLEMENTED PLUS YUP MASS OR HIGH TENS. HAVE AN ESTABLISHED H. I. ON THEIR COUNTY OR TO MULTI COUNTY LENSES THAT HAVE NOT CONNECTED HIGH TIMES OR HAVE ADDITIONAL COUNTIES IN THE REGION TO CONNECT. IS IT ESTIMATES THESE PRIORITY COUNTIES AND LENDS US WILL ADD FORTY SEVEN ADDITIONAL CONNECTIONS WITH TWENTY FIVE OF THESE YOU MUST PROVIDERS AND TWENTY TWO CONNECTIONS TO HOSPITALS. AIDING THESE CONNECTIONS IN THESE AREAS IN THESE RURAL COUNTIES WILL ALSO ALLOW ACCESS TO ONGOING FEDERAL FUNDING TO MAINTAIN CONNECTIONS. PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY THIS FUNDING WITHOUT LAST ALLOWED MS IT SHOULD MERGING ACCELERATE THE IMPACT OF THIS TO MOST IMPORTANT DATA INITIATIVES CONSISTENT HIGH TENS THESE RESOURCES WILL PERMANENTE TO AT LAST SYNCHRONIZES FINISH DOESN'T PERMIT CALIFORNIA TO SUMA NATIONWIDE EMS LEADERSHIP POSITION. BY ALLOWING EMS PROVIDER AGENCIES AND LANDS AS THE AND THE STATE THE ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE CONTINUUM OF BMS PATIENT CARE FROM THE TIME OF THE NINE ONE ONE CALL TO THE MOMENT PATIENTLY SO HOSPITAL HAVING A MEDIAN RELIABLE ACCESS TO PATIENT HOSPITAL OUTCOME DATA. FOR THESE PATIENTS TRANSPORTED BY EMS PROVIDERS ALLOW EMS PROVIDER AGENCIES WHIMS AS AN ANSWER TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF THE ARREST CARE PROVIDED IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES AND ENSURE OPTIMAL PREHOSPITAL. CARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DR GRANT IT'S A QUESTION. AN INMATE AND DECIDE CLARIFY INTENT SO- V. C. TALK ABOUT THE SEVEN POINT SIX TO GET THE NINE GRANTS SO HOW MUCH OF A GAP IS LEFT IF YOU'RE SO SUCCESSFUL SO HE'S AT THE HIGH PRIORITY BUT I'D JUST TRYING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. SO HOW MANY LENSES ARE WHAT POPULATIONS WOULD STILL NOT BE IN IF YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL IN DOING THESE NINE GRANTS AND BRING THOSE ONES ON BOARD OF WHAT'S THAT HOW PUBLIC IS THE GAP. SIX OF THE SEVENTEEN NEVER BROUGHT ON BOARD WE HAVE SEVENTEEN OUTSTANDING LENDS US. OKAY SO BASICALLY THE NINE I ASSUME WOULD BE TO CLOSE THE GAP FROM. SEVENTEEN TO. EIGHTEEN TEAMS TO EIGHT CORRECT KAY AND THEN. ANY THOUGHTS ON THE EIGHT EARLY JUST MORE W. MORE CHALLENGING ARE OBVIOUS THIS IS A JUNIOR AT THE HIGH PRIORITY ONES. WE'VE TARGETED THE MORE RURAL POPULATIONS AT THIS TIME TO EXTEND THE SYSTEM OUT TO INCREASE. THEIR ABILITY TO COLLECT AND PROVIDE YOU MISSTATED TO CALIFORNIA OKAY SO MAYBE JUST A CLEAR SO OF THE EIGHT AND AGAIN YOU MAKE YOU HAVEN'T EXACTLY DECIDED WHICH ARE THE NINE YET I PRESUME- BUT- WHAT'S THE POPULATION SIZE OF THE ROOM. REMAINDER THAT STILL NOT COVERED ADDED SO I KNOW YOU'RE PRIORITIZING RULE COMMITTEES THAT MAKE SENSE- ARE THERE SOME URBAN COUNTIES THAT ARE LEFT IN THAT EIGHT OR IS IT MAINLY GROW ALL ROLLS ON THANK YOU WHAT THE SIZE OF THE POPULATION. YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE TELLING ME L. A. COUNTY IS ONE OF THE EIGHT AND I GUESS THE REASON WE HAVE A REALLY LARGE POPULATION PROBABLY ISN'T BUT- JUST GETTING SENSE OF THE SIZE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE GAP. YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION FROM ME BUT I CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOU AND PROVIDE IT. OKAY SO I DID THAT AND THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL JUST TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF SEO HOW COMPLETE THE SYSTEM IS. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. BURKE THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S MOVE ON NOW TO THE FINAL ISSUE ISSUE NUMBER FIVE. STATEWIDE RESPONSE EXPENDITURES. OKAY SO IN THIS POPOSAL IS FOR. ONGOING CULTURE RESPONSE FUNDING FOR THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR. MS REQUESTING SIXTEEN POINT NINE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR ESTIMATED DIRECT RESPONSE EXPENDITURES. FOR CONTINUED MEDICAL STAFFING AMBULANCE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AND OTHER RELATED SUPPORT COST. TO CONTINUE RESPONDING TO AND MITIGATING THE IMPACTS OF COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. FAILURE TO PROVIDE THE REQUESTED FUNDING WILL SEVERELY LIMIT MS RESPONSE ACTIVITIES ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE CRITICAL MEDICAL CARE AND SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S CITIZENS WHO'VE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING PROGRAMMATIC AND FISCAL NEEDS AT THIS TIME MS REQUESTING THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES UTILIZING THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS. ONGOING VACCINATION EFFORTS ACROSS THE STATE FOR ALL AGE GROUPS NECESSITATING THE DEPLOYMENT OF AMBULANCES AND MEDICAL STAFFING SUPPORT BOTH LOCALLY AND STATEWIDE. CREASED VACCINATION EFFORTS UILIZING PARAMEDICS AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIANS TO ENSURE THE HOME BOUND CALIFORNIA CITIZENS ARE VACCINATED. MEDICAL SURJECTIVE HE'S ACROSS THE STATE WILL DECLINE IN SUMMER FALL AND SLIGHTLY INCREASED AGAIN IN THE WINTER MONTHS ASSASSINATING THE DEPLOYMENT OF ADDITIONAL MEDICAL RESOURCES STATEWIDE. DISASTER RESPONSE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNT OR DRAFT FUNDING WILL NO LONGER BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER. COVERT NINETEEN VARIANTS WILL INCREASE RESPONSE ACTIVITIES STATEWIDE. AND DICK VIEWS BUT THESE PROJECTIONS ARE ESSENTIALLY BASED ON 30% OF OUR- RESPONSE LEVELS DURING THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR. THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WILL ALSO WILL ALLOW HIM TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE BOTH NEW. AND CONTINUING CRITICAL RESPONSE ACTIVITIES ENSURE THAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE SUPPORT STAFFING LOGISTICAL NEEDS OF BOTH MEDICAL AND VACCINATION SITES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I HIGH AND CERTAINLY KNOW ABOUT. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS NOW THINGS LIKE VENTILATORS AMBULANCE DOES TRANSPORT. HEALTH CARE PERSONNEL AND ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW I KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO REALLY GET OUR VACCINES OUT THERE IN MOBERLY GOING OUT AS WELL TESTING AS WELL AS PROVIDING. THAT AND WE APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE ANYTHING SPECTRUM- THANK YOU IN FACT IT'S JUST A QUESTION INSTANCE SOMEONE ALSO TIES TO ISSUE THREE HUMAN RESOURCE BUT WHAT WHAT THIS M. SISSY IS THE FUTURE OF THE HEALTH COURSE SO I HEAR THIS ROLE FOR HELPING OUT VACCINATIONS. OF DISCRETE SIR CREATED THAT IS FUNDS THE COVE IT IS THE SOMETHING THAT MINISTRATION IS WANTS TO CONTINUE BEYOND THE SOME SORT OF A RAPID NO I KNOW RAPID RESPONSES RIGHT WORD BUT SOME SORT OF EXTENDED RESPONSE OR IS IT SOMETHING THAT AFTER WE GET THROUGH BECAUSE OF IT AND WE GET HOPEFULLY A LOT MORE PEOPLE VACCINATED AND NEVIN'S GOT TAKE A LITTLE TIME TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN BUT THEN WE WOULD SHUT DOWN SO. WHAT'S WHAT'S THE M. S.'S VIEW I MEAN YOU'VE YOUR ASK YOU DID ASK FOR YOU KNOW HUMAN RESOURCES WORKLOADS SUPPORT CENTER SO WHAT WHAT WHAT DO YOU SEE THE. HEALTH COR GOING INTO THE FUTURE. THE CARD. IS A GREAT QUESTION DOCTOR PAN. HEALTHCOR IS HAS DEMONSTRATED ITSELF IS AN INVALUABLE PIECE OF THE RESPONSE PUZZLE AND- IS TO MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL PERSPECTIVE WHERE IT FITS PASSED HIS FEELING SPECIFIC SHIPS SO WHAT WE FOUND IS OUR CALUMET TEAMS WE CAN DEPLOY A WHOLE TEAM FOR A- CHUNK OF TIME A WEEK TWO WEEKS TWO MONTHS. THE HAVE A GREAT DEPLOYABLE RESEARCH RESOURCE TO FILL A NEED IN AN ALTERNATE CARE FACILITY BUT NOT SO MUCH IN HOSPITALS AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND EVEN CORRECTIONAL. INSTITUTIONS IN THOSE FACILITIES THEY'RE ALL GEARED AROUND THE SHIFT WORK AND WHAT HEALTHCARE GAVE US THE ABILITY TO DO WHAT IS RAPIDLY BRING UP BRING ON AND DEPLOY. PEOPLE TO FILL SHIFTS SPECIFICALLY WITHOUT YOU KNOW AT WHERE WE DIDN'T HAVE A WAY TO DO THAT PREVIOUSLY WE COULDN'T TAKE A TEAM AND SEND THEM TO THE HOSPITAL HOSPITAL WHERE STAFF AND SAY YOU KNOW TRYING TO FILL THE SHELVES. SO IT'S ENDED UP BEING A REALLY. CHEAP HEAD AGAIN- YOU KNOW- WORLD HOLES TO HELP FILL SOME OF THESE GAPS SO- WITH CALLUM OUT TO HELP COR- SOLUTION HAS HAS REALLY ENDED UP BEING INVALUABLE. BUT IT DIDN'T END UP BEING AS LARGEST SOLUTION AS WE FORESAW BUT- IT'S REALLY BECOME WELL INTEGRATED- THOUSANDS OF SHIPS BEING FILLED BY HEALTHCOR HUNDREDS OF FOLKS BEING ON BOARD I DON'T KNOW THOSE NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME BUT- IF YOU'D LIKE THOSE- I THINK- CRAIG JOHNSON WHO MAY BE ON THE CALL CAN ANSWER THOSE. OR WE. CAN GET THOSE FOR YOU BUT SOME. AS I GET YOUR CLOSE TO A ANSWER WELL I GUESS I'M REALLY A LITTLE TO THE FUTURE AS WELL CERTAINLY WE LEARN CERTAIN LESSONS. I WELL I WAS TRYING TO GET AT AND APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWER IS THAT. IT GIVEN WHAT WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT HEALTH CORNER IS PROBABLY PLAN TO CONTINUE IT INTO THE FUTURE BEYOND SENSE THE CODE TO RESPONSE. AND IF WE ARE TO BE GOOD TO HAVE A BETTER ARTICULATION. OF THIS- THE ROLE HEALTH CORE WOULD BE PLAYING AND HOW WE PLAN TO BUILD IT OUT AND THEN WHAT KIND OF ON GOING YOU KNOW. FUNDING OR INVESTMENTS WE NEED TO MAINTAIN IT BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH MANY ARE VOLUNTEERS RIGHT YOU HOUSE HR ISSUES. OTHER TYPES OF THINGS MAINTAINED A LIST OF PEOPLE ETCETERA. SO THE SO IS THIS GOING TO BE AN IDEAL IS THIS GOING TO BE AN ONGOING INVESTMENT. AS A PART OF A RESPONSE IT HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND- THE PERHAPS MORE SPECIFIC OR DETAILED LAN OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO ABOUT DOING IT IN THE NATURE OF THAT ONGOING INVESTMENT. I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL GIVEN THE LESSONS WE'VE LEARNED CELLS- EVERY SEE WHAT HE SAID SO ON. THE END AND I'M SURE THERE'S GONNA BE SOME VERY INTERESTING THINGS AND WHAT YOU COULD. SHARE WITH ME ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED DURING TELL THAT BUT I'M ALSO SAYING WELL WHAT ABOUT GOING FORWARD SO. IS THIS A LIKE A- COUPLE YEARS AGO FUNDUS AND WESHUT IT DOWN BUT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER SO I HOPE THAT TO AND PERHAPS IN THE COMING YEAR- WE HAVE A BETTER. AT A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THE FUTURE OF HEALTH CORE IS ESPECIALLY SINCE IN FUTURE BUDGETS WILL. BE PERHAPS MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT NOT HELD BY SUPPORT FOR. START. DISORGANIZATION THEY ARE SLOWLY DOING WILL GET YOU A- PER. NOW AND IN THE- THANK YOU. AND I THINK WELL WHEN THE THINGS THAT DOCTOR PANTS ASKING OR OR MY QUESTION IS. OF THE BANG FOR THE BUCK MEAN FOR GONNA PUT A BUNCH OF MONEY INTO THE INFRASTRUCTURE ARE WE GOING TO BE USING THEM- AN OFF TO BE ABLE TO. TO MAKE IT WORTH OUR WHILE IN IN SOME KIND OF ON GOING. WAY AND I WILL JUST. I WILL JUST KNOW MAYBE WITH A SOUR GRAPES THAT I KNOW I AND- AS AN LCSW AND DOCTOR WOULD. BOTH APPLY TO BE A PART OF- THE HEALTH CARE AND WE WERE REJECTED- THEY SAID THAT WE HAD A CONFLICT FOR SOME REASON BUT ANYWAY JUST TO SAY. GOING FORWARD YOU HAVE VALUED AT PEOPLE WILLING TO VOLUNTEER THEIR TIME. RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU SOMETIMES OKAY. EXCLUSIONS IN. ADAM CHERUBS. AND- WHAT WE DO IF I CAN ADD ONE MORE QUICK CANCER- WE DO HAVE THE- BENEFIT OF ECONOMIES OF SCALE IN THAT THE SAME INFRASTRUCTURE IS GOING TO BE UTILIZED FOR CALMATTERS WILL BE USED FOR HELP OR SOME MOVING FORWARD IT WILL BE AN INVALUABLE TOOL THAT WON'T COST US A LOT OF MONEY SO I THINK THE BANG FOR THE BUCK WILL BE WILL BE QUITE HIGH.

IF THE CONSUMERS NEEDS ARE NOT MET WITH THOSE SERVICES THE CARE STEPS- TO CONNECT THEM WITH THEIR ON MANAGED CARE PLAN EITHER COMMERCIAL PLAN OR MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLAN WOULD BE TAKEN ON THE IDEAS THAT IT IS A ONE OF A KIND OF ENTRY INTO ACCESS IS AT A TIERED LEVEL. TO MAKE SURE THAT BENEFICIARIES NEEDS ARE BEING MET- HOWEVER WOULD MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS IF ADDITIONAL SERVICES WERE BEING NEEDED. THE BUSINESS PLATFORM WOULD ALSO FACILITATE A STATE WIDE YOU CONSOLE SYSTEM TO ALLOW PRIMARY CARE PEDIATRIC IN FAMILY PRACTICE PROVIDERS. TO RECEIVE A SYNCHRONOUS SUPPORT AND CONSULTATION TO MANAGE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. FOR THEIR PATIENTS AND THEIR PRACTICES. IN ADDITION OF FOR THE CAPACITY BUILDING WITH- THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH IN SCHOOLS. IT WOULD ALLOW US YOU ARE PROPOSED.

GRANTS ARE PROVIDED FOR PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THEM INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THESE TYPES OF GRAMS WOULD INCLUDE MEDICARE'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS TRIBAL ENTITIES HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLANS MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS.

GRANTS FOR THE MEDICARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM WOULD BE ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. PROGRAM ARE WHAT'S. KNOWN AS B. H. Q. I. P. I GRANTS AND SENT INTO WOULD BE A MATTER BY THE- OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. IN CONSULTATION WITH THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR. ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD BE PROVIDING PROVIDER TRAINING FOR PEDIATRIC PRIMARY CARE AND OTHER PROVIDERS IN REGARDS TO THE FULL PLATFORM TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE REACHING ACROSS THE VARIOUS POINTS OF THE DELIVERY SYSTEM NOT JUST SCHOOLS BUT PRIMARY CARE PEDIATRIC OFFICES TO ENSURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND HOW TO INFORM. OTHER PATIENTS OF THE SERVICES THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR THROUGH THE VIRTUAL PLATFORMS AS WELL AS MAKING SURE THEY UNDERSTAND THE KEY ON THE U. CONSULTATIONS ON HOW TO LINK ALL OF THE VARIOUS OPPORTUNITIES WITH IN THE CHILDREN YOUTH PROPOSAL. OKAY AND I'M GONNA AND STOP EITHER I THINK WOOD MISTER LEBRON. WAS DOING AN OVERVIEW WE DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS GONNA. GOOGLE GO QUICKLY TO THE TO THE ISSUE SO I'M GONNA. I'M GONNA ASK THE L. A. OPEN APARTMENT FINANCE IF YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES ON ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. THAT WE JUST ISSUE NUMBER FIVE THAT WE JUST WENT OVER AND THEN WE'LL WORK OUR WAY BACKWARDS HELLO. MISTER SHEILA WHO'S SPEAKING HERE COULD I SAY THERE YOU GO MR SHOULD. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M. THE FELLOWSHIP. SYSTEM JUST TO BE COMMENTS MAKE YOU KNOW WE WOULD FIRST NOTE THAT THE- TRAILER BILL FOR THIS INITIATIVE REMAINS UNAVAILABLE FOR REVIEW AND THAT'LL THAT'LL BE NECESSARY TO PROPERLY ASSESS THE MERITS OF THE INITIATIVE AS A WHOLE- NEXT AS AN OVER ARCHING COMMENT ON MULTIPLE- THE MULTIPLE DH CS COMPONENTS OF THE INITIATIVE. YOU KNOW WE WOULD STOP WE WOULD NOTE THAT SOME OF THESE ONE TIME PROPOSALS WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN ONGOING COSTS THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY SCORED- THIS THESE WOULD INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE THE DIRECT INCENTIVE PAYMENTS FOR SCHOOL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND THE GRANT FUNDING FOR EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES WHICH ARE INTENDED TO INCREASE ACCESS TO SERVICES. IN THE AMOUNT OF SERVICES PROVIDED. I IN ADDITION WE'RE NOT WHY THE NEW MAY. PROPOSAL FOR- IN PAYMENTS FOR SCHOOLS. WOULD ALSO INCLUDE MANAGED CARE PLANS AS AN ENTITY THAT COULD RECEIVE FUNDS WHEN THERE IS A SIMPLE A RELATIVELY SIMILAR PROPOSAL. INTRODUCED IN JANUARY TO CREATE AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM. FOR SCHOOL SERVICES SPECIFIC TO MANAGED CARE- NEXT WE JUST KNOW THAT FOR MOST OF THESE PROPOSALS. BENEFITS TO CHILDREN USE WOULD NOT BE REALIZED IMMEDIATELY AND WOULD RATHER BE REALIZED- SOME YEARS INTO THE FUTURE. AND THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER HOW IT WANTS TO PRIORITIZE A MORE IMMEDIATE INTERVENTIONS FOR CHILDREN AND USE IT THAT IS ITS WISH- NEXT FOR THE VIRTUAL PLATFORM WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSAL. TO BE VERY SIGNIFICANT LEFT AND IF IT WERE TO MOVE FORWARD THE LEGISLATURE- ME WHICH TO SORT OF VERY CLOSELY TO MONITOR ITS IMPLEMENTATION ESPECIALLY WHAT CHALLENGES MAY ARISE- WITH SECURING THE BUSINESS VENDOR TO IMPLEMENT THE PLATFORM- WE ALSO HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE VIRTUAL PLATFORMS SUCH AS- YOU KNOW HOW THE ADMINISTRATION WILL ENSURE ACCESS TO THE SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH THE PLATFORM- GIVEN DISPARITIES IN BROADBAND ACCESS- WHAT THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES WILL END UP BEING BOTH FIRST SORT OF COMMERCIAL AND MEDICARE PLANS- FOR SERVICE PRINCE SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH THE PLATFORM. AND JUST SORT OF GENERALLY WHAT RULES AROUND PARENTAL CONSENT WILL EXIST. WHEN I CHILDREN ACCESS SERVICES TO THE PLATFORM- THOSE ARE THOSE ARE ALL OF OUR SORT OF OVER ARCHING COMMENTS ON THE INITIATIVE AT THIS TIME AND WE ARE SO HAPPY TO PROVIDE FURTHER ASSISTANCE WHERE. NEEDED THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DEPARTMENT. FINANCE ANYTHING ON ISSUE NUMBER FIVE. AS AN OFFICE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING FOR. TO ADD AT THIS TIME BUT WE'RE TO ANSWER NUMBER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND ON THIS WHAT I WOULD SAY AND I KNOW WE'VE BEEN THIS. PROPOSAL IF YOU WILL BUT- AND I THINK WE'LL HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND I THINK THAT THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS AND- I WAS GOING TO SAY. ALSO THAT I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SCHOOL COMPONENT IN THE- INSIDE OF COMPONENT WHEN THEY'RE WE HAVE A PROPOSALS VERY SIMILAR TO THAT. AND HOW ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE GONNA WORK THROUGH IT. I THINK WE'RE ALL INTRIGUED WITH THE IDEA OF A OF A BIG- PLATFORM- AS THE BACKBONE OF A OF A OF A SYSTEM- BUT THEN YOU ALSO HAVE TO THINK IT'LL IS IT LIKE THE HIGH SPEED RAIL RIGHT DO WE JUST WILL DO WE BUILD THAT TRACK FIRST OR DO WE BUILD ALL THE ARTERIES THAT WOULD LEAD INTO IT FIRST BECAUSE- PEOPLE CALL INTO SOMETHING THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT. ON THE GROUND FOR THEM THEM TO BE REFERRED TO. AND THEN I THINK WHAT WE'VE ALL OF KNOWLEDGE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES IN PLACE RIGHT NOW. R. FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- SO I THINK YOU KNOW I GET THAT THIS IS NOT FULLY ALTHOUGH FOR US OUT. CAN WE GET THE FULL. WILL BE ABLE TO EVALUATE IT BETTER BUT I THINK THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT SOME REDUNDANCIES- AND AGAIN THE ISSUE OF WE HAVE A CRISIS ON OUR HANDS RIGHT. AND WITH SOME URGENCY THAT WILL NEED TO RESPOND TO AS WELL. TECH DEPEND. IT YOU AND AGAIN YOU KNOW WE'VE WE- HEARD FOR. SOME OF THE- OTHER A- AS WELL- AND- IT'S- THAT. THERE'S ALWAYS A- I AM. D. N. D. PROPOSED. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT- VERTICALLY TO. KOBE WE- C. DOUSED BY. RATES MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE- RELATED TO. WHAT HAPPENED AND SO- APPRECIATE THIS. INVEST AND THE CENTER TO TODAY ISSUE- I THINK IT'S CHAIRS NOTE WE MAY PREVIOUS HEARING THERE AUDIO THERE'S A MORE THERE'S ALSO THIS PHOTO IMMEDIATE NEED AND I THERE'S A LONGER. GILT FRAME AND THEN THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES- GOING TO GO RIGHT AWAY EITHER- I GUESS ONE I DO HAVE A IS ACTUALLY I THINK AFFRONT IT UP IN THE LAW YEAR AND TALKED ON BUT BASS ACTUALLY. C. S. QUESTION A ONE ONE THE COMPOSED. OF THIS. IS I THINK. IS TO ACT BETTER DO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS TRYING TO CARE FOR. EVEN FOR AND TRAIN VIA THE HAND MORE MY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- THAT FROM THE NET. PERSPECTIVE ARE FROM D. MET CALPERS. I'LL TELL YOU I'M AND SO SHIP TRAIN- BUSY OUT THE- YOU DON'T TEACHERS GOT. SO SHOULD TRAIN. BE GIVEN THE- SIDE- TENDED TO SEE. CHILDREN WHO HAD- HI RATES OF HEALTH. HOWEVER AS A GENERAL. AND SOMEONE WHO CARE OF A LOT CAL- THE ISSUE WASN'T AT THAT. TRADING ALTHOUGH I'M SAYING HELLO TO THIS IS WE COULD TRY. THE PEOPLE. XIN SAID MORE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES- BECAUSE ON THE PAYMENT SIDE. YEAH WE FIRST OF ALL VIA CHALLENGES WITH MENTAL HEALTH CODES BECAUSE I WASN'T A QUOTE MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDE ALL THE GENERAL PEDIATRICIAN EVEN THOUGH IT WAS THE- GOT EXTRA TRAINING- IN ADDITION. THESE PATIENTS TAKE MORE TIME- YOU KNOW YOU DON'T% DEAL YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE I COULD SET UP FOR TEST FOR MENTAL HEALTH I MEAN YOU ACTUALLY SIT DOWN AND TALK TO. THE PATIENT AND THE FAMILIES AND SO FORTH. ARE WE GOING TO THINK ABOUT THE REIMBURSEMENT STRUCTURE. OUR OUR OUR- AND ALSO IN INDIA WE'RE GOING TO PLAN RICK PROCUREMENT AND ALL THIS OTHER STUFF SO TO BE SURE THAT. THE WAY THE PLANS PAY THE PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS WHO ACTUALLY SPENDING THE TIME DOING THE YOU KNOW MODERATE. MENTAL HEALTH THAT DAY ACTUALLY- COURAGE TO DO THAT AND SO. TO THAT FOR. A EVEN THOUGH THE SKILLS. MY PAYMENT SYSTEM IS IN A WAY THAT. MEANS THAT I'M GONNA REFERRAL THESE PEOPLE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF THE ONES I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF BECAUSE BASICALLY THE PAYMENT STRUCTURE DOESN'T REWARD. SPENDING THAT KIND OF TIME. SOZOMEN SOME THOUGHT INDEED CS ABOUT. THAT ASPECT AGAIN EXTEND OUR WORK FORCE EXTEND OUR CAPACITY. TO TAKE CARE OF. CHILDREN WHO HAVE MILD TO MODERATE ALBEIT FOR HEALTH ISSUES. I THINK THERE'S KIND OF TWO MAIN COMPONENTS WITHIN THE PROPOSAL THAT WOULD STOP POTENTIALLY SPEAK TO. SOME OF THE POINTS THAT YOU'RE RAISING THE FIRST ONE IS. OF THE ADDITIONAL MEDIC CAL DYADIC SERVICES BENEFITS THAT IS THE ADDITION OF CODES THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR MORE ABOUT INTEGRATED SERVICE TO BE HAPPENING WITHIN THE PRIMARY CARE. FOR PEDIATRIC OFFICE WHERE ADDITIONAL CODES- AND RATES TIED TO THEM WOULD BE A BILLABLE FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR THOSE TYPES OF INTEGRATED SERVICES WHERE YOU'RE DOING. THE MULTI SAYS MEN ARE HEADING OFF TO A SOCIAL WORKER WITH AN OFFICE IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S AVAILABLE I'M IN ALLOWING FOR THOSE SERVICES TO BE BUILT- WITHIN THAT THAT PLATFORM WE'RE HOPING TO GET SOME INFORMATION OUT REGARDING THAT- DYADIC SERVICES. A NEW BENEFIT CODES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF THE PEOPLE OF AN UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT IT'S QUITE COMPREHENSIVE IN REGARDS TO YOU- REALLY PUSHING THE NEEDLE. INTEGRATED APPROACH AND ALLOWING FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT. OF THOSE SERVICES- SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE ONE PIECE THAT POINT OUT NOT SPECIFIC TO MEDICARE MOST OF THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH IS ALL PAYER AS YOUR TO TWENTY FIVE HOWEVER THAT ONE PORTION IS FOR MEDIC CAL. A BENEFIT PIECES ON THE DYADIC CARE SERVICES AND THEN THE OTHER PIECE WAS- DEPARTMENT SHOULD EARLIER IS FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS I'M SURE WANTING SOME A CONSULTATION THERE WOULD BE AND YOU CONSOLE. I TIED TO THE VIRTUAL PLATFORM WHERE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO MAYBE GET SOME CONSULTATION WITH- A PSYCHIATRIC EXPERT- TO BE ABLE TO INFORM. OF AND BUILD THOSE PIECES BUT AS YOU MENTIONED IT WASN'T NECESSARILY SO MUCH ON THE TRAINING SIDE BUT I JUST DID WANT TO MENTION THAT. I THINK THE BIGGEST PART THAT WORK CONSIDERING THAT WOULD BE A BILLABLE- ON BEHALF OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS WOULD BE THOSE DYADIC CARE SERVICES. SO I GUESS SIR FIRST OF ALL. I APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO PROVIDE MORE E. TONSILS FROM MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO PRIMARY CARE SITES SO WHEN THAT DOES BE PAID FOR SO THAT'S GOOD I'M ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS BECAUSE WE EVEN HAVE A COMPONENT. I KNOW IT'S ON THE HOT SPOT SIDE THE TRAIN PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS TO DO MORE MENTAL HEALTH ON THEIR OWN RIGHT. GIVEN THAT KIND OF TRAINING- TO BE ABLE TO THE BILL BACK TO PAY. AND- BUT- THAT THAT WILL BE THAT EFFORT ALSO IN CARE TO BEING TO MANAGE MORE WHICH WOULD AND DEPRESSURIZED THE AMOUNT OF REFERRALS TO ARE STILL. ARE SORT OF CONSTRAINED MENTAL. HEALTH WORKFORCE AND THAT WE HAVE- REIMBURSEMENTS THAT RECOGNIZE THAT SO THAT'S WILL SEPARATE FROM THE ATTIC- I APPRECIATE THE DYADIC PART BUT- BUT JUST RECOGNIZING THAT NEED DAN THIS IS A PRIORITY THEY COMMUNICATE A CONVERSATION WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH PLAN. BUT THE- WITH THE- MANAGED CARE PLANS MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLANS ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF PAYMENTS ARE GIVING TO PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS WHO ACTUALLY PROVIDING MORE SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OBVIOUSLY SEVERE IS GOING TO BE YOU KNOW WHEN I GET BEHAVIOR HEALTH SPECIALIST BUT- BUT TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY ALLOW THEM TO- WHEN THEY GOT IN THE TRAINING TO BE ABLE TO RAMP UP. THEIR ABILITY TO TAKE CARE FOR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND THEN ACTUALLY JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THE DYADIC SERVICES AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE THIS BECAUSE MORE OF A FAMILY APPROACH BUT YOU DID MENTION. PEDIATRICS AGAIN THIS IS A THE PERHAPS ALSO COMMUNICATION THE PLANS BECAUSE WILL HAPPEN IS THAT I'M A PEDIATRICIAN SO FAMILY POSITION LESS OF AN ISSUE THAT SOME TEACHERS AND THEY SAY WELL WAIT A MINUTE YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF ADULTS SO NOW YOU'RE DOING THE FAMILY THING WITH THE PARENTS. SO THAT'S ME VERY CLEAR COMMUNICATION THAT IF I PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE DIET ADD HER TO THE FAMILY THROUGH THE ATTIC SERVICES THAT I THAT I CAN IS A PEDIATRICIAN I DON'T HAVE SOME ADMINISTRATOR IN A PLAN GOING WELL NO NO WE CAN'T PAY FOR THAT BECAUSE YOUR FUTURE SHOULD YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF ADULTS AND NOW YOU'RE ACTUALLY BUILDING THE FIRST SERVICE. THAT'S RELATED TO AN ADULT THE PARENT OR GUARDIAN HOWEVER FOR THE DYAD AND SO THAT HAS TO BE REALLY CLEAR BECAUSE AND BY THE WAY YOU GOT TO DO SOME EDUCATION AND THAT TOO BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE THE AUTOMATIC RESPONSE I CAN SEE HAPPENING. AND THAT HAPPENS. YOU KNOW. FEW TIMES BEACH. ARE GO TO BE FOR US. IN SAY WELL YOU KNOW I HAVE TO SITE EVERY TIME ITO DO THIS TO GET PAID. SO YOU SPEAK TO THAT. YEAH I MEAN THAT THAT IS THE INTENTION BEHIND THE NEW BENEFIT SERVICES AND WE WILL MAKE IT VERY CLEAR BOTH THE PARTS THAT MEDICARE PROVIDER MANUAL AS WELL AS ANY INSTRUCTION TO THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS. I APPRECIATED BECAUSE OF SOMEONE'S RIGHT PROVIDING TOBACCO COUNSELING AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS TO PARENTS- YOU KNOW- DID DID DID IT IS FRUSTRATING BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT TAKING CARE OF THE CHILD ALSO INCLUDES THEIR HOME ENVIRONMENT INCLUDES- HELPING US SUPPORTING TO PARENTS BUT- YOU KNOW USUALLY IT'S LIKE WE JUST DO THAT WE DO THAT FOR FREE BECAUSE WE DEBTS RIGHT THING TO DO BUT WE KNOW THAT WE WILL GET PAID FOR IT AND- AND WE'RE GONNA DO EVEN MORE WHICH I THINK IS GOING TO BE GOOD. IT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT THAT'S COMMUNICATED TO ALL THE INTERMEDIARIES BETWEEN THE DOCTORS TO FRAME THE SERVICE AND USE A STATIC CAL DIRECTOR TODAY ALSO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TELLING. ME RIGHT NOW. SO I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY- IF WE CAN GO BACK. TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR- DEPARTMENT FINANCED TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE STATE DEPARTMENT FINANCE YOU HAVE ANYTHING ON ISSUES ONE THROUGH FOUR. SO I'LL TAKE THAT AS A NO- L. A. DO YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES ON ISSUE NUMBER FOUR FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL COVERAGE FOR UNDOCUMENTED SENIOR SIXTEEN OVER. I MEDICARE- YES SO WE EARLIER THIS YEAR WE RELEASED ON A COST ESTIMATE OF THE BALLOT FOR EXPANDING FULL SCOPE COVERAGE TO ESSENTIALLY ALL CURRENTLY INELIGIBLE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS- THAT ARE THAT ARE OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE ALL- BASED ON THIS THIS ASSESSMENT. THE ADMINISTRATION'S COST ESTIMATE FOR THE SIXTY AN OLD SIXTY AN OLDER POPULATION APPEARS HIGHER THAN WE WOULD HAVE ANTICIPATED WE'RE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND ITS COST ESTIMATE- AND ONCE WE GET SOME GREATER DETAIL. WE WILL- SHARE IF- SHARE ANY CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE ABOUT THE REASONABLENESS OF THE COST ESTIMATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK WE- I THINK WE ALL SHARE THE GOAL OF TRYING TO COVER AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE CAN AFFORD TO DO. A DOCTOR PAN ANYTHING ON THIS ISSUE. I'LL JUST SAY IS THAT- NEIL THE SENATE HAS FOR SEVERAL YEARS ACTUALLY PUT FORTH IN OUR VERSION THE BUDGET BUT- AND THE FINAL. FOR ONLY SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER I'M GLAD SEAT ADMINISTRATION'S DOING SIXTY I THINK WE RECOGNIZE ULTIMATELY. ESPECIALLY WITH- EXPERIENCE CODED BUT EVEN BEFORE- HOPEFULLY WE CAN EVENTUALLY GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY COVER EVERYONE- AND- BUT DEPRECIATE THE STEP THANK YOU. OKAY MISTER JOHNSON HOW ABOUT ISSUE NUMBER THREE MATERNAL HEALTH INVESTMENT. POST PARTUM AND DO A LOT OF BENEFITS- NO CONCERN ON EITHER ITEMS TWO OR THREE JUST HAVE COMMENTS ON THE ISSUE ONE THERE. OKAY AND I'M A I'M I'M VERY HAPPY TO SEE BOTH OF THESE THINGS ARE BOTH IN OUR AREA OF INTEREST FOR ME HAVE DONE LEGISLATION ON A- ISSUE. NUMBER THE FIRST ONE ON THIS ONE- WITH THE COVERAGE EXTENSION AFTER POST PARTUM I THINK THIS IS JUST A GOOD GOOD GOOD COMMON SENSE AND GOOD PUBLIC POLICY. WHICH ON- JUST MAKE THE OBSERVATION TALK ABOUT DIETS LITTLE EARLIER THAT OF COURSE I SEE THE CHILD AND THEN I SEE THE MOMS WITH THE CHILD. AND THEN THE MOM DOESN'T HAVE THE COVERAGE BECAUSE IT'S NOW PASSED BY THE SIX WEEKS OR SOMETHING SO- DIRT SIXTY DAYS SO- I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THIS. THE PERSON WHO ABSOLUTE THAT ACTUALLY IS STILL SEEING THE MOM AND ROOM EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT THERE. TO CARE TAKER A ON THE THEIR THEIR POSITION BUT THEN HAVING TO STRUGGLE WITH THE FACT THAT THE MOTHER DOESN'T HAVE THE COVERAGE SOMETHING. THE CHILD AND RECOGNIZING THAT SHE MIGHT NEED HELP. OKAY AS ISSUE YOU SAID YOU DID NOT HAVE ISSUES WITH ISSUE NUMBER TWO. MR JOHNSON HELLO. YEP NO CONCERNS OR COMMENTS ON ISSUES TWO OR THREE THERE SO OKAY- DOCUMENT. IF YOU TO THE QUESTION ON HOW TO THE A FAMILY HEALTH ESTIMATES- SO FOR EXAMPLE FOR CCS PERHAPS THAT'S WITH G. H. P. P. BUT- I KNOW THAT FOR EXAMPLE GOOD PORTION OF CCS IS NEONATAL SELVES ON KIND OF PREMATURE BABY THEY'RE GOING TO BE AND- BUT I WAS WONDERING WHAT THEIR DINNER. WE SAW DURING CO BID- YOU KNOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT KIDS WITH CHRONIC DISEASES SIGNIFICAN DISEASES WHETHER THERE WAS SO WE TALKING A CASELOAD HERE BUT WHETHER DOES A DROP OFF IN THEIR USE OF SERVICES DURING COVE IT. AND THEN ALSO WITH THEIR DAUGHER MIGHT HAVE BEEN A DROP OFF IN PEOPLE COMING IN WHICH MIGHT TAKE UP BECAUSE WEDNESDAY COMING IN FOR REGULAR CHECK UP SO THERE'S LESS LIKELY DIRT AGAIN SCREEN FOR SONY IDENTIFIED. AND THEN THEY MIGHT BE IDENTIFIED LATER SO THE NON NICK YOU KIDS BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT KIDS WHO MIGHT- BE TAKE YEAH THIS PEOPLE GOING BACK TO THEIR DOCTORS OFFICES AND BRING THEIR CHILDREN AND THAT. WE MIGHT SEE A LITTLE BIT OF AN UPTICK IN PEOPLE WHO NOW IDENTIFIED AS NEEDING CCS AS WELL AS WHETHER FOR THE EXISTING CCS POPULATION WAS A DROP IN USE OF SERVICES. BECAUSE OF COVERED. AND I KNOW WE'RE DOING TELL. BUT IDEA KNOW WHETHER WAS WE SAW THAT OR NOT. YES THIS IS JC EVEN WITH TELL WE SIGNAL. BURKE IN YOUR- OF BOTH INPATIENT EMERGENCY ROOM AND OUTPATIENT INCLUDING PRIMARY CARE VISITS THIS FALL SPECIALTY CARE VISIT SO. WELL I DO KNOW A NUMBER OF PROVIDERS WERE ABLE TO CAN BURKE CHIU THAT THE TELEHEALTH MODALITY. WE ACTUALLY STILL HAD QUITE A FEW WHO WERE DOING BOTH IN PERSON AND TELEHEALTH BUT STILL EVEN WITH THOSE MENTALITY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS OF. UTILIZATION ACROSS ALL DELIVERY SYSTEMS EVEN INCLUDING PRESCRIPTIONS. DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THE TRENDS IN OUR DATA- FOR BOTH INPATIENT EVERY SO FOR BOTH MANAGED CARE AND FEE FOR SERVICE- UTILIZATION IS STARTING TO INCREASE AGAIN. AS AS EVERYTHING HAS STARTED OPENING UP AND WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THOSE SERVICES BUT- DECREASES ACROSS THE BOARD. YEAH I JUST WONDER WHETHER GET UNTIL CANNELLA CALL REBOUND THAT'S FINE AT THE RATE WE DESCRIBE A LITTLE YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF BILLIONS IN UPTICK IN THIS COMING YEAR AS HOPEFULLY WE ARE. A PEOPLE MORE COMFORTABLE WERE OPENING UP MORE. THAT IS WHAT WE HOPE THAT PEOPLE WILL START GOING INTO REGULAR CARE GET IT IS. PART NUMBER ONE MESSAGES A POLICE ARE ENGAGING IN THE NORMAL CARE GO BACK AND GET YOUR ANNUAL VISITS IF YOU MISSED- YOUR ASSESSMENTS WE ASSUME IT WILL- INCLUDED NUMBER FOLLOW UPS IN IN IN YOUR PARTICULAR COMMENTS- POTENTIAL. REFERRALS FOR THE CCS PROGRAM. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF ISSUE NUMBER TWO. IS A JOHNSON. THE CARD FOR FINISH NUMBER. THAT WAS ABOUT ISSUE NINETY TWO OKAY EACH IS YOUR NUMBER ONE. THERE YOU GO. THANK YEAH THANK YOU BEN BEN JOHNSON WITH THE L. A. L. WE HAVE PERFORMED- OUR INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF THE MAY REVISION MEDIC CALLOUS TO MET AND OVERALL DH CS ESTIMATE AND DON'T HAVE ANY MAJOR CONCERNS OVER AT THIS TIME I JUST FOCUS AND- I JUST FOR SOME BRIEF COMMENTS ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S CASELOAD- ESTIMATES FOR MEDIC CAL AND- TO NOTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SIGNIFICANTLY RIVER REVISED DOWNWARDS ITS ESTIMATE FOR MEDIC CAL CASELOAD- ACROSS CHANGED SOME ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE AVERAGE COST OF THE NEW ENROLLEES THAT WOULD JOIN THE PROGRAM- BECAUSE OF COVERT NINETEEN. ALTERNATELY IF THE ADMINISTRATION'S OUT REVISED CASELESS OPTIONS TO REDUCE COSTS ACROSS 202-120-2120 TWO BY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND AND- WE ULTIMATELY FINDS THAT THE REVISED AT KEESLER PROJECTIONS DO ALIGN CLOSELY WITH WHAT THE L. A. O. EXPECTED AND THEREFORE DON'T RECOMMEND ANY CASE THAT. JUST WANTS AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE AT NOW IT'S MOVE ON TO NUMBERS. MISS COOPER. OKAY AND I'M ASSUMING YOU'RE WANTING ME TO STOP AFTER EACH ISSUE SO YOU CAN GO TO THE QUESTIONS I JUST WANT TO CONFIRM YES THAT'S CONTENT THAT IS CORRECT. GREAT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SO ISSUE NUMBER SIX THAT BUDGET INCLUDES- AN OVERALL TWO POINT FOUR FIVE FIVE. BILLION TOTAL FUNDS OVER THREE YEARS FOR THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUE ON INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS OF THIS AMOUNT A MINIMUM OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TOTAL FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THE INCREASED INFRASTRUCTURE TARGETED TO INDIVIDUALS. AGED TWENTY FIVE AND YOUNGER. AND IS CONSIDERED A PART OF THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE DISCUSSED EARLIER. A MINIMUM OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IS ALSO- ALLOCATED SPECIFICALLY FOR SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS- FOR THOSE WHO ARE DEEMED INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. AND THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT TWO BILLION IN BUDGET YOUR PLUS ONE I TO GO TO THE OVERALL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE- SIMILAR TO THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION OPPOSED TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. BUT BROADENING TO A LARGER NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIES WOULD BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THOSE APPLICATIONS. THE FUNDING IS ALLOCATED TO PROVIDE COMPETITIVE GRANTS TO QUALIFIED ENTITIES TO CONSTRUCT A CHOIR AND REHABILITATE REAL ESTATE ASSETS TO EXPAND THE FULL pTREATMENT RESOURCES. AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. THE DALLAS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M COREY ISSUE TO WHAT THE HELL ELSE- JUST A JUST A FEW COMMENTS TO MAKE- FIRST WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT ACCORDING TO THE ADMINISTRATION THERE WILL BE TRAILER BILL FOR THIS PROPOSAL BUT IT'S NOT YET AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW GOING TO NEED THAT TO PROPERLY ASSESS THE MERITS OF THE PROPOSAL AND IT'S- ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS- WE FIND THAT- YOU KNOW THERE ARE FURTHER DETAILS ON THIS PROPOSAL THAT'LL NEED TO BE NEEDED TO CONDUCT MORE THOROUGH REVIEWS SUCH AS HOW THE GRAND RIVER. SUCH AS HOW THE GRANT REQUIREMENTS- FOR APPLICANTS WILL DIFFER DEPENDING ON WHICH POPULATION BE WHETHER IT BE CHILDREN AND YOUTH OR ICED TEAS OR JUST OVERALL INDIVIDUALS AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS- IN GENERAL THAT THE FACILITIES ARE FOR- NEXT WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT ROBUST TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL ENTITIES IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO ENGAGE IN REAL ESTATE ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO DELAYS IN GETTING THIS GRANT FUNDING OUT FOR FACILITIES- THERE HAVE BEEN SOME ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO THIS PROPOSAL TO SHIFT RESOURCES TOWARDS- PROVIDING THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WHICH WE FIND TO BE REASONABLE- NEXT WE PROVIDE WE FIND THAT PROVIDING FUNDS TO THIS PROPOSAL. TARGETED AT THE I. S. T. POPULATION IS REASONABLE AS WELL- BUT WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THERE IS A MAJOR REVISION PROPOSAL WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS- FOR THE STATE HOSPITALS TO CONTINUE OR DISCONTINUE ACCEPTING LETTERMAN PETROUS SHORT OR LPS PATIENTS- FROM COUNTIES AND IF BOTH THESE PROPOSALS WERE TO BE IMPLEMENTED YOU KNOW WE FIND THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THERE WOULD BE DEMAND FROM LOCAL ENTITIES- FOR FUNDING THROUGH THIS PROPOSAL FOR- FACILITIES FOR THAT POPULATION THAT WOULD BE SORT OF- NO LONGER BEING TAKEN IN AT THE STATE HOSPITAL FACILITIES- LASTLY WE JUST KNOW THAT GIVEN THE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDING ADDED TO THIS PROPOSAL THAT. IT'LL BE IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER LOCAL ENTITIES HAVE THE CAPACITY AND WILLINGNESS TO PROVIDE COMMITTED FUNDING FOR THE ONGOING COSTS OF PROVIDING SERVICES IN THESE FACILITIES- GIVEN THAT THIS IS A ONE TIME INVESTMENT AND THAT THERE WOULD LIKELY BE ADDITIONAL SERVICE COSTS THAT. THEY WOULD NEED TO TAKE ON IF THEY WERE TO PURSUE THIS FUND- ARE UNDERSTAND OF THIS FROM. IS LOCAL AND- WOULD NEED TO AGREE TO FUND THE ON GOING COSTS OF OPERATING THESE FACILITIES FOR A PERIOD OF THIRTY YEARS- WHILE WE DON'T HAVE MAJOR REASONS TO BELIEVE THAT THESE ENTITIES WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO THIS- WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT IF IT TURNS OUT- THAT THESE LOCAL ENTITIES DO NOT WISH TO AGREE TO THE ONGOING SERVICE COSTS COMMITMENT WITHIN THE PROPOSAL- THAT MAY READ THE- RESULT IN SORT OF REDUCE DEMAND FOR THE- GRANT PROGRAM AS WELL- THOSE ARE ALL OF OUR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME AND- WE'RE HAPPY TO SORT OF PROVIDE FURTHER ASSISTANCE WHERE NEEDED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND- THEN THIS OF COURSE IS A PARTICULAR INTEREST TO ME AG I HAVE. I HAVE BEEN LONG POUNDING ON THE ISSUE THAT WE NEED MORE. MORE APPROPRIATE HOUSING AND HOUSING CHOICES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM SEVERE AND PERSISTENT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. AS WELL AS THOSE ON THE- ON THE LOWER END OF THE CONTINUUM. O I. SO WHAT WE ARE WE ARE. VERY EXCITED TO LOOK pDETAILS COMING ON THIS- I ALSO HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT IT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT. JUST ENOUGH TO BUILD THEM AND THEY WILL COME IF WE DON'T HAVE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND THE- SUPPORTS IN PLACE. TO BE ABLE TO ACTION ACCURATELY STAFF THEM. AS YOU KNOW FOR A LOT OF OUR FOLKS WHO DO WHO NEED. SOME OF THE MOST A CONSISTENT HELP IT'S NOT JUST. A ROOM THAT THEY NEEDED A LOT MORE WRAPAROUND THAT NEEDS TO GO WITH THAT. SO HOW WE'RE GOING TO FUND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND HOW ALL OF THESE. INITIATIVES WORK TOGETHER I THINK- UNLESS YOU HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS RIGHT NOW MISS COOPER I STILL THINK A LOT OF IT STILL. NEEDS TO BE BORNE OUT TO SEE. WHAT THE WHAT THE ACTUAL PLAN IS BEFORE WE SAY YES TO THIS- BUT- WE ARE. I AM VERY EXCITED THAT THAT WERE ACTUALLY GONNA FOCUS ON THIS- AND I AGREED THAT IF WE DO MAKE THE MOVE FROM STATE HOSPITALS AT THAT IS GOING TO. PUT EVEN MORE PRESSURE ON THE SYSTEM. AND WE DON'T HAVE ROOM OR RESOURCES RIGHT NOW FOR THE FOLKS WHO. WHO NEED TO BE IN HIS BEDROOM. AT THE THOUGHT OF. HAVING EVEN MORE. MAKES A LITTLE HAS. AND WE ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THE PLAN IS TO BE SO. I THINK WE- ARE I AM CERTAINLY VERY. COGNISANT AND- APPRECIATE. THAT THE PUTTING THIS FORWARD BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE'S- A LOT MORE THAN. THAT WE NEED TO KNOW BEFORE WE CAN. WALK BEFORE WE CAN TAKE ANY ACTION ON. A DEPEND. THANK YOU AND- THIS IS CERTAINLY APPRECIATE- THIS EFFORT TO HELP SUPPORTER I GUESS THE PHYSICAL BRICK AND MORTAR INFRASTRUCTURE HERE BUT I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THE CHAIR THAT FOR THIS TO BE SUCCESSFUL THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER FACTORS AT PLAY IN WE'D LIKE TO SEE THIS TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO CERTAINLY NOT OPPOSED TO LOOKING AT THE ONE BE SURE WE'RE DOING IT THROUGH ENOUGH ANALYSIS AND- IT AND DESERVE THINKING ABOUT THOUGH AND THIS IS ONE PIECE OF THIS LARGER PACKAGE BUT- I REALLY DO THINK. ANYTHING MENTIONED BEFORE IS THAT WE NEED TO DO- YOUNG ASSESSOR EXISTING WORK FORCE RIGHT SO WE HAVE- MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE WORKING FOR GOVERNMENT ENTITIES COUNTIES IT'S ADDRESS WE HAVE THOSE- WORKING SPRITE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WE MAY HAVE SOME WHO ARE RETIRED OR WHO MIGHT BE WILLING TO COME BACK GIVEN THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES YEAH WE TALKED A LITTLE ABOUT THE PRIMARY CARE WORKFORCE CELL WHO- WHO AND THE LEVELS- YOU DON'T PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS WITH THE LEAD MAN OF MENTAL HEALTH ANY BILL PROVIDE. YOU KNOW WHAT THE MALL JUST SAYING WE ARE FOR THEM ALL TO BE HERE FOR HEALTH BECAUSE THAT WE OVERWHELM THEM SO THEN WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THIS PIECE NOW WHAT IS A STAFFING RIGHT SO WE'RE GOING TO DO EACH COUNCIL CA I WANNA HAVE YOU CAN SEE THE COUNCIL SO HOW MANY HOW MANY PEOPLE WE NEED TO DO THE E. CONSULS FOR THE SCHOOLS FOR THE PRIVATE FOR THE PRIMARY CARE PRACTICE HOW MANY PEOPLE THEY NEED TO STAFF THESE FACILITIES. WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT MAPPING THAT OUT OF BED TO BE SURE WE HAVE THOSE THAT AND THINK ABOUT HOW WE MAXIMIZE THE WORK FORCE AND THE VARIOUS RESOURCES WE HAVE TO DO TO DO THAT SO I THINK THE MAIN GATE THE NAME WAS A SPEAKING PERHAPS A LARGER PROPOSAL RIGHT AND WHERE WHERE WHERE THE RESOURCE IS MOST NEEDED IN TERMS OF THE BOTTLENECKS IN ONE THE OTHER CHALLENGES PERHAPS IS THAT IT AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOUR BILL THE STATE'S PRETTY FOR THE MONEY BUT AS I THINK IS L. L. POINTED OUT. THAT THE LOCAL IS- COUNTY IF YOU'VE DEPEND ON THE LOCAL PEOPLE TO PROVIDE THE ON GOING OUT YOU KNOW OPERATIONS QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO FIGHT OR NOT OR TO GO BE. WILLING TO DO THAT OR NOT- THERE'S EVEN LOW CATION ISSUES RIGHT. THEN FOR. AND I. HATE TO SAY THIS BUT- NICE AS- TIME. WHEN SOMEONE'S FOR. TO BUILD MEDICAL THIS. AND PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THAT AREA. WANT IT- THERE AND- FOR EVEN FINDING LOCATION. AND SO FOR. MAYBE A CHALLENGE FOR SOME CERTAIN AREAS AS WELL. AND YOU KNOW- SO WE COULD IF WE COULD END UP WITH A SITUATION WHERE. WELL ON BECAUSE THE LOCALS HAVE TO COMMIT TO PROVIDE THE THIRTY YEARS OF SERVICE ETCETERA. AND THAT BECOMES THE EXCUSE FOR CERTAIN AREAS ACTUALLY DECLINED BECAUSE- THE REAL REASON IS BECAUSE PEOPLE IN THAT COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW THEY HAVE UNDUE OUR AND- NOW. THEY DON'T WANT A MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY IN YOUR AREA RIGHT. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS WE HAVE TO DISTRIBUTE YOU KNOW WE THE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE- THAT WE- THE FUND. TURNS DOESN'T. MATCH THE- DEMAND TO NEED OR DESIRE DAY DON'T ADDRESS THE EQUITY ISSUES THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE THINGS LIKE THAT SO- SO. THESE ARE NOT ALL THINGS THE REASONS TO SAY NO TO THIS BUT THESE ARE THINGS THAT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE SOME ANSWERS ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO ABOUT DOING THIS HOW WHAT KIND OF INCENTIVES. AND ARE WE JUST AND OTHER THAN THAT WE DISTRIBUTE THE RESOURCES ARE PROBABLY L. IS THIS THE RIGHT AMOUNT TO PUT ON THE BRICK MORTAR SIDE. IS THE AMOUNTS ARE BEING PROPOSED FOR THE WORK FORCE SIDE THE RIGHT AMOUNTS OF THAT WE ACTUALLY WHAT IS THE WORK FORCE LEVEL WE NEED TO GET TO. BE A WAR WE NOW WE DO KNOW WE NEED TO GET TO IN FOUR YEARS WITH A BILL THIS OUT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO GET TO IN FOUR YEARS. WE BUILD OF THE I T. FLAT. DISTANCE- VIRTUAL PLATFORM WILL GET WE'RE GONNA NEED TO BE IN FOUR YEARS RIGHT SO. THOSE TYPES OF THINGS WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL I REALIZE YOU DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS RIGHT NOW BUT- WE GOT TO COME P WITH A PROCESS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THOSE ANSWERS AND HOW. AND CERTAINLY I THINK IS A LEGISLATURE WILL BE SURE THAT WE'RE ENGAGED IN THAT AND THAT- AND THAT THERE'S A- NO COLLABORATION AND TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT- THE- SO THAT WE'RE PUTTING THE RIGHT RESOURCES IN THE RIGHT PLACES THAT. THAT WERE YOU KNOW IN THE END IT HAS TO BE DONE AND I KNOW THIS IS OUR PURPOSE IS TO HELP. NOW TO HELP THESE. THESE CHILDREN. USE RIGHT AND SO HAVING. KIND ASSESSMENT IS GOOD YOU KNOW. IT IS TO BE A. I WOULD JUST MAKE A FEW KEY ABOUT- I WE DID PUT OUT SOME OF ON THE PLUMBING ON SIGNET GAP THAT EXIST IN THIS. OF IN THE GOVERNOR BUDGET FAR BEYOND WHAT WHAT A THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION WOULD. NOT EVEN INCLUDE THE SPECIFIC FOCUS ON ICE TEA IN CHILDREN YOU SO COMPLETELY ACKNOWLEDGING OF THE COMMENTS AROUND THE OPERATING HE SAYS THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED BY THE LOCAL ENTITIES BUT GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF THIS INVESTMENT YOU'D BE PUTTING A BRICK AND MORTAR WE DO NEED SOME ASSURANCES THAT THOSE SERVICES WOULD BE ABLE TO CONTINUE. ON AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO BE REIMBURSED FOR THEIR SERVICES AND I'M JUST WHAT FLAG THAT- IT IS TIMELY WITH THE MOVEMENT FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE REFORM AT LEAST FOR THE MEDIC CAL. SERVICES BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD ALLOW US TO GO OUTSIDE OF THE COST BASED REIMBURSEMENT AND INTO THE TO THE FEE SCHEDULE REIMBURSED MANAGEMENT WHICH WILL BE BENEFICIAL TO OUR COUNTY PARTNERS AND SO JUST WANTED TO MAKE THOSE TWO TWO POINTS IN REGARDS TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS BEING MADE AND WE ARE VERY MUCH LOOKING AROUND WHAT FLEXIBILITIES MAY BE NEEDED. I'M IN THE LOCAL AREA GIVEN THE HISTORICAL- YOU KNOW PUSH BACK OF SOMEBODY'S TAX OF FACILITIES GOING INTO VARIOUS NEIGHBORHOODS OR COMMUNITIES AND ARE TAKING THAT SERIOUSLY AND HOPEFULLY WILL HAVE AN UPDATED PROPOSAL. FOR YOU GUYS SHORTLY SO YOU CAN SEE SOME ADDITIONAL DETAILS OF THE DEPARTMENT SPEAKING ABOUT. YEAH I AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND WE ALSO REALIZE THAT THIS ISN'T STANDING IN ISOLATION RIGHT SO WE TALKED MY S. T. WERE DOING TELLING HIM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACTUALLY GET MORE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ON THAT END TOO SO. WOOD WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS WHOLE THESE INTERLOCKING PIECES OF WORK TOGETHER AND ARE WE NOW GOING TO WRITE BALLOT SO I APPRECIATE THAT BUT JUST SERVICE ONGOING DIALOGUE ABOUT OKAY. THE STATE WOULD DON'T NECESSARILY DISAGREE WITH THE PIECES THE QUESTION IS LIKE WHAT HOW WE DETERMINE HOW BIG EACH PIECES SO THAT WE'RE NOT BY GO NOW WE HAVE FACILITY ARE WE GET MONEY FACILITIES BUT THE UPTAKE ISN'T THERE OR SO LEASE BUT THERE'S NO ONE TO STAFF THEM AND SO. DECIDED TO IT- JUST TRYING TO GET TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE FIGURED IT ALL OUT AND- HOPEFULLY WE CAN HAVE A FREE SHARING OF INFORMATION SO THAT WE KNOW- SO THAT WE HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING. OF HOW THESE PIECES COME TOGETHER- WHEN I GOT AND I'VE FIRST GOT ELECTED STAR CITY AND I RIPPED CENTRAL STOCKTON DON'T AND CENTRAL STAR AND NOT WAS HAVE A LOT OF MEETING I WAS FOR THING I WOULD HE TO ME GROUPON TOO MANY TO HOMES IN IN NEIGHBORHOOD AND- AND I NEVER THOUGHT IT WAS THAT WAS THE ISSUE IT WAS ISSUE THAT THEY WERE VERY WELL RUN AND SO YOU HAD PEOPLE OUT ALL OVER THE PLACE WHICH IS AND WHAT BEGINS TO PROVIDE THAT COMMUNITY PUSH BACK WHEN THEY SEE WHEN THEY SEE THINGS NOT GOING VERY WELL- SO. ANYWAY WE KNOW WE HAVE WORK IN FRONT OF US TO DO OKAY ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC HOSPITALS. SO THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES THREE HUNDRED MILLION- OF. FEDERAL FUNDS TO PAY DIRECT GRANTS TO THE DESIGNATED PUBLIC HOSPITALS IN SUPPORT OF THEIR HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES. ON THE DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC- DESIGNATED PUBLIC HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN INTEGRAL TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE. EFFORT INCLUDING THEIR EFFORTS TO INCREASE SURGE CAPACITY RAPID EXPAND INTO PLAY TESTING ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT. AND DISTRIBUTION OF VACCINES AS- SPECIFICALLY IN REGARDS TO A LOT ABOUT POPULATIONS IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HELP BEING THAT THE STATE CLOSE. MANY OF THOSE EQUITY GAPS ADDITIONALLY A GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE REQUEST BEING FOCUSED ON COULD NINETEEN RESPONSE AND UTILIZING FEDERAL FUNDS BEFORE. I GENERAL FUND. AND THAT IS BY THE DEPARTMENT FEELS IT IS MORE APPROPRIATE TO USE THE CORONA VIRUS. FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS VERSUS GENERAL FUND. AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. FOR MUCH THE L. A. O. I'VE BEEN JOHNSON WITH THE L. A. L. OUR OFFICE RECENTLY RELEASED ANALYSIS OF HOW COULD NINETEEN HAS AFFECTED HEALTHCARE ACCESS AND UTILIZATION- BUT A MAJOR OUTSTANDING QUESTION THAT WE FOUND CHALLENGING TO ANSWER WAS WAS HOW THE PANDEMIC HAS AFFECTED STATE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS OUT FINANCES. AND THEREFORE WE DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW LIKE WHICH PROVIDERS WHICH CLASSES OF PROVIDERS OR pGREATEST FINANCIAL STRESS DUE TO THE- DUE TO THE PANDEMIC BOTH GIVEN THE REDUCTIONS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN UTILIZATION AND LIKE THE LIKELY THE ASSOCIATED REIMBURSEMENT BUT ALSO GIVEN THE FEDERAL- HEALTH CARE PROVIDER FINANCIAL RELIEF THAT'S BEEN. PROVIDED TO DATE THROUGH FEDERAL LEGISLATION GIVEN THESE OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS- WE DO GUYS HAVE SOME SOME FURTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED FINANCIAL RELIEF FOR ONE CLASS ONLY ONE CLASS OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND SO PRIOR TO DECIDING ON THIS PROPOSAL WE WOULD- RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE- ASKING THE ADMINISTRATION- WHITE PUBLIC DESIGNATED PUBLIC HOSPITALS ALONE ARE TARGETED FOR THIS RELIEF. AND WHAT INFORMATION ON THE HOSPITAL'S NET FINANCIAL POSITIONS- INFORMED THE PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO THE CORRECT OF THAT QUESTION IS COOPER OR SO- IT SPECIFICALLY IS FOCUSED ON AND THE DESIGNATED PUBLIC HOSPITALS HAVE ISSUED A PUBLIC LETTER REGARDING FEES- THIS REQUEST ON THAT CAN BE PROVIDED TO YOU ARE UNDESERVEDLY FOCUSES ON THE FACT THAT THE DESIGNATED PUBLIC HOSPITALS SELF FINANCED MEDICARE FEE FOR SERVICE IN REGARDS TO THE SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE. VERY DIFFERENT THAN MOST OF OUR OTHER PROVIDERS IN MEDIC CAL I JUST TO BE CLEAR AND GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES OF MEDICARE FEE FOR SERVICE SERVICES DURING THE PUBLIC- THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY SPECIFICALLY AROUND THE INPATIENT STAYS TIED TO THE. KOBE NINETEEN RESPONSE ON THAT WAS WHY I WE LOOKED AT THIS RISK AND WE TO THE POT UP PUBLIC HOSPITALS THEIR CELL. BINANCE AND THEY IT WORKS IN. THANK YOU I KNOW- WE HAVE ONE OF PUBLIC COST DE IN MY IN MY- AND I KNOW PLANNED KNOW THINGS BEEN A STRONG. YEAH I. CERTAINLY UNDER. THE CHALLENGES FACED WITH PUBLIC COST DURING. THIS IS. ALSO SOME. FOR PARTICULARLY. THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW THE PROVIDER NETWORK FOR MANTA CAL- YOU KNOW RULE HOSPITAL'S OTHER HOSPITALS THAT- IT'S- THAT MIGHT BE IN FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY THAT STAYS CLOSE WITH AND DENY CARE FOR. MEDI CAL- AND- ALSO EVEN CLINICS OR PRIMARY CARE SITES AS WELL PARTICULARLY IN AREAS WHERE THERE'S- WHERE THEY'RE NOT VERY DENSE OCCASIONS THEY DID NOT A LOT OF THEM SO WELL. THAT THAT WITH MY CREATE ACCESS ISSUES HAS THERE BEEN ANY SERVE ANALYSIS DONE BY DCS. OUT INTO REGARD TO BE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE. TO START DEVELOPING HOLES IN. AREAS OF. MARKS ACTUALLY HOW CARE PROVIDER NOT BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH IT AND IN FINANCIAL TROUBLE. WE HAVE NOT BEEN MADE AWARE TO MY KNOWLEDGE OF THAT BUT I WILL DEFINITELY GO BACK AND CHECK WITH MY TEAM JUST TO VERIFY THIS. OF ANY REPORTS OF- YOU KNOW RURAL HOSPITALS ARE CLOSING AT THIS TIME WE HAVE BEEN IN PRETTY CLOSE COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE VARIOUS- HOSPITAL ASSOCIATIONS DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY OF BUT WE CAN DEFINITELY TAKE THAT BACK AND HOW CONVERSATIONS TO ENSURE THEIR SOMETHING WE'RE NOT MISSING IN THAT REGARD. OKAY I NEEDED TO GET AND OBVIOUSLY AN ACCESS ISSUE IF WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE UNTIL CLINICS HOSPITALS APPRECIATED THANK YOU. IN CONVERSATIONS- THIS MORNING WITH THAT CENTER LAYERED HE MENTIONED- HAS HOSPITAL WATSONVILLE HAVING SOME ISSUES RIGHT NOW AND AGAIN THAT'S AN AREA THAT THAT RURAL AREA THAT SERVES A LOT OF- HIGH RISK FOLKS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR OUR SELLABLE. OF CALIFORNIA SO- AND EVERY THAT WE CERTAINLY DO NOT WANT TO BE OVERLOOKED SO THANK YOU FOR LOOKING INTO THOSE MISS COOPER OKAY- ISSUE NUMBER. EIGHT CAROLINE. FOR SO MANY OVER- ACCOUNTING PROPOSALS THAT ARE WITHIN THE- THAT THE BUDGET SO THE FIRST ONE IS AROUND EIGHTY POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT SERVICE OF THE BUDGET INCLUDES THREE HUNDRED MILLION TOTAL FUNDS- FOR LOCAL ASSISTANCE. USING AND FIFTEEN MILLION TOTAL FUNDS FOR STATE OPERATIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT- IS LOOKING TO PROCURE A BUSINESS SOLUTION THAT WILL UTILIZE ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA. AND INFORMATION FROM NOT ONLY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES- AS WELL AS OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS COUNTIES PROVIDERS BENEFICIARIES SOCIAL SERVICES. OTHER STATE DEPARTMENTS TO PULL IN ALL OF THE VARIOUS- CLINICAL. AND ADMINISTRATIVE DATA INTO ONE KIND OF STANDARD PLATFORM FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES- THROUGHOUT THE MEDICARE PROGRAM MANY OF THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED IN NINETEEN YOUR INDIVIDUAL ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS SEPARATE. OF THE AND THERE'S NO ONE SINGLE PROCESS TO BRING ALL OF THOSE SERVICES AND INFORMATION TOGETHER AND A HOLISTIC APPROACH FOR DELIVERING SERVICES TO MEDIC HOW- BENEFICIARIES IN CALIFORNIA. SO SOME OF THE FUNCTIONS WILL INCLUDE- THE PIECES ARE CALAIS AND A POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT OUR STRATEGY WHERE THE INFORMATION FOR THE BENEFICIARY WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR THE STANDARDIZED I STATE RISK A STRATIFICATION AND THE RISK HERE THAT WE ARE BUILDING WITHIN THE PROPOSAL. IT WOULD HELP IDENTIFY GAPS IN CARE FOR THE BENEFICIARY ALSO FOR THE PROVIDER TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND BASED ON ALL OF THE DATA COMING INTO THE DEPARTMENT WHAT ARE THE EXISTING GAPS IN CARE. IT WOULD IDENTIFY GAPS IN BENEFITS YOUR REFERRALS OF FOR EXAMPLE A PREGNANT WOMAN WHO IS WITHOUT WHICH OF THE SYSTEM WOULD BE ABLE TO FIVE THOSE TYPES OF REFERRAL FLAGS FOR PROVIDERS IN MANAGED CARE PLANS. TO BE ABLE TO ACT ON THE ALSO LIST- IF THERE'S A CASE MANAGER OR CARE MANAGER ASSIGNED TO THAT BENEFICIARY THE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHO TO CONTACT TO ENSURE A COORDINATION WITH THE NAMES ARE CARE MANAGER CASE MANAGER. IT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE ANY OF OUR STANDARDIZED ASSESSMENTS THAT ARE BEING EXPLORED DURING THE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT STRATEGY AS WELL AS PROVIDE INFORMATION AS COLLECTED ON SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. IMPACTING THE BENEFICIARY'S ABILITY TO GET BETTER CARE WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE HEALTH EDUCATION AND TIPS. FOR THE BENEFICIARIES AND EMPOWER BENEFITS HERE'S THREE OWNERS THEIR OF THEIR OWN. THE GOAL IS A IS THAT ALL PLAYING COVER. AND HAVE ACCESS A COP. LONGITUDINAL PATIENT RECORD WITH ALL MEDICAL AND SOCIAL INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE DEPARTMENT TO SHARE WITH THEM AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DEPARTMENT FINANCE. ONLY BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER COMMENTS ON THIS ONE OR ISSUES- EIGHT THROUGH NINE BUT WERE AVAILABLE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FOR FINANCE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR JOHNSON- HELLO AGAIN- OVERALL WE FIND THAT THIS PROPOSAL COULD. IMPROVE MEDIC CALIFORNIANS. MONITORING AND CARE DELIVERY IN ANALYSIS THAT WE RELEASED ON CHALLENGE EQUITY CONSIDERATIONS WE RAISE THE QUESTION OF HOW CARRYING AND HENCE MINTS TO MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS. POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD TRANSLATE INTO IMPROVED STATEWIDE PERFORMANCE MONITORING HEALTH EQUITY AND QUALITY OUTCOMES SUCH AS THROUGH PUBLIC REPORTING IN DASHBOARDS. IN CONCEPT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE PROPOSED SERVICE COULD FACILITATE THIS IMPROVE STATEWIDE PERFORMANCE MONITORING BY SERVING AS A CENTRAL REPOSITORY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA ACROSS MEDICAL DELIVERY SYSTEMS- FOR EXAMPLE. IF THE SERVICE COULD POTENTIALLY COLLECT AND REPORT INFORMATION ON MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES TALK REPORTED HEALTH STATUS AND HOUSING STABILITY WHICH WOULD BE COLLECTED THE ASSESSMENTS THAT MANAGED CARE. PLANS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GET THE MEMBERS. HOW WE DO HAVE SOME OUTSTANDING ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL- AND THESE INCLUDE ONE- WHY EXACTLY- WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S- RATIONALE FOR NOT THINKING THAT THIS IS A AND I. T. PROJECT THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE STATE'S IT PROJECT OVERSIGHT RULES. WHAT IS THE FULL INTENDED SKIRT WITH THE FUNCTIONALITY FOR EXAMPLE HOW MIGHT BE ARE. THE SYSTEM INTERFACE WITH RELATED STATE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE AVAILABILITY ON A STATEWIDE BASIS. WE ALSO HAVE QUESTIONS THEN ABOUT WHERE THE ANTICIPATED TIMELINES FOR WHEN THE SERVICE WOULD BE OPERATIONAL AND WHAT ARE THE ONGOING COSTS OF MAINTAINING SERVICE. AND SO WE JUST FIND THAT GATHERING SUCH INFORMATION PRIOR TO TAKING ACTION ON THE PROPOSAL COULD HELP THE LEGISLATURE PARA VALUE WITH THE PROPOSAL'S MERIT THANKS AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE. A SPOUSE WITH A- WHO NEEDS A TERM CARE SO WELL AT ONGOING CARE WITH WITH THE BY DAY. HEALTH CARE PLANS AND SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS I THINK WHAT RIGHT THIS WOULD BE THIS WOULD BE VERY VALUABLE FOR EVERYBODY NOT JUST THE MEDICARE POPULATION- BUT THE POPULATION AND IN GENERAL. I THINK THIS WOULD COULD COULD BENEFIT- AND I WOULD AGREE THAT I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE. TO MORE TO MORE DETAILS- BLADE OUT- BUT I THINK WE ALL ARE IN FAVOR OF- AND INNOVATING MEDIC CAL- BUT CAN YOU YOU TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE AROUND Y. THE WHY YOU'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THIS IS AN I. T. ISSUE. SINCE MOST OF THIS SEEMS TO BE A AROUND A LOT OF ISSUES ABOUT AROUND IT AND HOW HOW WE PUT DATA IN AND BRING IT OUT AND USE IT AGAIN. SURE I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW THERE'S A LARGE NUMBER OF- BENDERS TO PROVIDE THIS. UP POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT SERVICE TODAY. AND SO REALLY LOOKING TO PROCURE A SERVICE PLATFORM. THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO MEET THE OBLIGATIONS AND EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD. ON INFORMATION SHARING AND PIECES WISE BUT ANALYTICAL BACKBONES AND DIFFERENT COMPONENTS. WELL WE WOULD BE- INCORPORATING DATA INTO THAT SYSTEM WHICH IS VERY COMMON WITH A LOT OF THE- SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE. UP TO MEDICARE THAT OUR IT PROJECTS. I'M JUST BECAUSE THERE'S DATA FLOWING IN AND OUT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT IT IS AN IT PROJECT BECAUSE IT'S REALLY AROUND A SERVICE PLATFORM FOR BENEFICIARIES UNITS FROM HEALTH EDUCATION. UNDERSTANDING THEIR GAP CLOSURE- YOU KNOW EASILY AT. THEIR FINGERTIPS AFTER A ONE STOP SHOP. AS WELL AS PROVIDERS. AND WE WOULDN'T BE MAINTAINING OR BUILDING THAT- I. T. INFRASTRUCTURE HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES YOU WOULD BE PARTNERING WITH. A VENDOR WHO HAS A PLATFORM THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO CUSTOMIZE FOR THE EXPECTATIONS OF CALIFORNIA. THAT WOULD ALLOW ALL THE VARIOUS DATA POINTS TO FLOW INTO THEIR WOULD BE INTERFACES INTO THAT SERVICE PLATFORMS. I'M BUT NOT NECESSARILY WHERE WE ARE BUILDING AN IT PLATFORM OURSELVES TO BE MAINTAINED BY THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES. DO YOU EVER SEE A TIME WHEN YOU COULD. EXPAND THIS BOTTLE. OR TO A LARGER POPULATION. I'M SO WE DON'T GET THAT QUITE. ALL APPLE AND- TO BRING IN MANY DATA FOR OUR DAUGHTER- I THINK WE'LL- WANT TO BUILD IT FOR MEDIC CAL TO START- AND THEN WE WOULD DEFINITELY EXPLORE THOSE CONVERSATIONS IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU THE DOCTOR CAN- PATRICIA YOUR ANSWER THAT YOU'RE GONNA USE A VENDOR SO YOU'RE NOT BUILDING OUT YOUR OWN IT SYSTEM I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THAT- THE NATURE YOUR AGREEMENT WITH THE VENDOR WHETHER- IT IS GOING TO BE SUCH THAT WERE THAT THE STATE IS NOT NON AND DEPENDENT ON THIS VENDOR RIGHT THAT- OBVIOUSLY WILL HAVE THE PRIVACY HOPEFULLY OUT ISSUES AND SO FORTH AND WHATEVER CONTRACT BUT ALSO- THAT- THE- THE STRUCTURE AND DESIGN OF THE DATA IS DONE IN A WAY THAT IS IN THE FUTURE WE DECIDE THAT WE WISH TO GO TO ANOTHER VENDOR. THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN ISSUE CORRECT OF COURSE THAT'S HOW WE WOULD DESIGN THE OF THE CONTRACT IN SIMILAR. THAT I'M AT THAT TIME AS WELL- SO WITHIN ISSUE NUMBER NINE HOLD ON ONE SECOND LET ME HOLD A MINUTE WAS COVERED CHECK UP JOHNSON SORRY DID YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES ON ON THE OTHER ISSUES IN THAT SECTION- YEAH WE WOULD JUST REYES ACTUALLY QUITE SIMILAR- QUESTIONS AROUND THE CALLIN PATH PROPOSAL WHICH IS THE- THE CAPACITY BUILDING FUNDING AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSING- TO ASSIST WITH THAT CRIMINAL JUST LOCAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCIES TO SORT OF. GET UP T SPEED AND BE ABLE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD BE PLACED ON THEM UNDER CALAMP- IN A FUTURE YEAR. TO PROVIDE. MASON ROLE MEANT IN MEDICARE. AS WELL AS TO IN THIS VARIOUS KINDS SERVICE DELIVERY- BEFORE. TO ME PRIOR TO THE RELEASE. AROUND I THE IN WITH THE REALM OF BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES- HAPPY TO. ANY MORE. ABOUT THE PROPOSAL OR R KICKED TO THE DEPARTMENT IF THEY WANT TO EXPLAIN IT SORT OF MORE MORE FULLY- SO WE- WE DO BELIEVE THAT THESE CALLOUS REQUIRE. THAT I THAT I SORT OF DESCRIBE CHIU DO- PRETTY. NEW ON THE PART OF LOCAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCIES AND ACCORDINGLY WHILE THE FULL EXTENT OF EXISTING- CAPACITY ON THE PART OF THESE AGENCIES IS NOT CLEAR. ASSISTING THEM WITH BUILDING THEIR CAPACITY TO MEET THEIR NEW RESPONSIBILITIES IT IS LIKELY WARRANTED. HOWEVER ADDS WITH THE- POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT SERVICE WE DO FIND THAT THERE ARE SOME FUNDAMENTAL DETAILS RELATED TO THE PROPOSAL THAT ARE MISSING. FIRST AVAILABLE BUDGET DOCUMENTS THAT WE'VE REVIEWED DON'T INDICATE WHAT WHAT KINDS BALLOT AND AGENCIES WOULD BE ELIGIBLE RECEIVE THIS FUNDING. HOW THE FUNDING WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED. WHAT EXACTLY WHAT CAPACITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES WOULD BE FUNDED AND THEN WHAT IS THE RATIONALE FOR THE PROPOSED FUNDING AMOUNT OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION. MOREOVER WE DO FIND THAT THERE IS SOME- SOME UNCERTAINTY AROUND WHETHER OR NOT FEDERAL MEDICAID WOULD BE AVAILABLE. TO SUPPORT THIS EFFORT UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IT'S AT ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FEDERAL MEDICAID FUNDS- AND SO IF TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS REALLY DOES REFLECT THE SORT OF TRUE NEEDS OF THESE LOCAL HEALTH AGENCIES. IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T ULTIMATELY APPROVED- THE PROUD THE PROVISION OF FEDERAL FUNDING FROM THE STATE MAY NEED TO. CONTRIBUTE MORE RESOURCES TO REALLY GET THESE AGENCIES UP TO SPEED SO. THAT THAT CONCLUDES MY THE REST OF MY COMMENTS ON THE SITE AND THEN THANK YOU FOR TURNING BACK TO US. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYTHING ABOUT BILLS ON THE MEDICALLY TAILORED MEAL. PILOT EXTENSION OR THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH QUALITY. PROGRAM WE WILL REYES QUESTIONS IN THE IN A COMMON THAT WE PER TO LIVE STAFFERS THIS MORE ON MEDIC TAILORED MEALS PER ONE THE QUESTION IS A SOUND THAT- KELLY FOR TO MAKE MEDICALLY ME A- ON INFLUENCER SPENT THAT WOULD BE AVAIL THROUGH MANAGE CARE BIG ON JAN FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO NOW THE EXACT EXTENT TO WHICH THOSE SERVICES WOULD GET UP AND RUNNING OUT ON THAT DATE IS A LITTLE UNCERTAIN THOUGH. PLANS COULD SORT OF TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY DO CONTRACT WITH EXISTING PROVIDERS TO TRY TO MAINTAIN SOME OF THOSE SERVICES- THE MAY REVISION THIS IS REALLY THE ONLY SERVICE THAT TIES TO ONE OF THAT IN LIEU OF SERVICES THAT'S GOING TO BE AVAILABLE THROUGH KALYAN THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUT THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES TO SORT OF PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL SORT OF PRE FUNDING OR BRIDGE FUNDING TO AND SO WE JUST HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT SORT OF WHAT IS THAT. WHAT IS THE RATIONALE FOR TARGETING FUNDS AT THIS SPECIFIC- SORT OF FUTURE IOS BENEFIT BEFORE THAT BENEFIT GET THOSE BENEFITS GET UP AND RUNNING AND SORT OF WHY OTHERS WERE NOT CONSIDERED FOR SUCH. DOCUMENTATIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU OUR DEPARTMENT FINANCE. S. THINKING I COULD EACH OF FINE WHICH IS LIKE TO AND THE INTO AND PROVIDING OF FOR MEDICALLY MEAL AS OPPOSED SOME OF OTHER AND OF SERVICES THAT WILL BECOME UP THROUGH THE KALYAN PROPOSED- THE REAL IN TEN HERE WAS FILL IN ABOUT TEN GAP- IN SERVICE THAT MAY. FOR THE CAN OF PILOT PROGRAM TO WIN THE SERVICES ARE RIGHT UP THE MIDDLE LIKE TO POINT OUT THE WITH THIS TO SOME OF THE L. A. O. HAS RAISED WITH THE PASS. CRIMINAL JUSTICE JUSTICE ORANGE PROPOSED- WE EXPECT SOME OF THOSE DETAILS HOPEFULLY BE CLEAR FOR. IN THE BILL LANGUAGE. YOU REALLY SHOULD. WORLD FOR THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- THE- BILL TO SEE THE COUNT I THINK. I'D LIKE I'D LIKE TO WHAT THE- THINKING ABOUT THE PAST BECAUSE I FOR LIKE THE HAVE FELT LIKE THEY BEEN UNDER UNDER FIVE- AS THE ONE TO DO A LOT ON THE WITH A LOT OF THE COVERT STUFF SO I% HOW ONE MORE- ONE MORE KIND OF SHIFT DOWN TO THE- ALTHOUGH AYE SIR SEE THE VALUE OF IT WHO CAN BE UP WITH THREE. RIGHT THEY THEY- THEY THE PER. SO I THINK THAT I THINK WE TO LOOK AT THAT ONE FURTHER- AND I AND I GUESS WOULD JUST HAVE OR LIKE. IF WE'RE GOING TO BE HOW. THE MEDIC TAILORED MEAL PILAR. A PER PROGRAM UP AND- THAT. QUESTION ABOUT CON. THAT THAT THE- LIKE I DON'T KNOW IF. ALREADY THESE IN PLACE BECAUSE IT SEEM LIKE IT WOULD BE- DEAR DEAR. DEAR COORDINATING MADE WITH A HOT. WHOSE PREPARE MEALS DISTANCE. OUT A THEN HOW WOULD HOW HOW DO WE HAVE PICKED. ACROSS THE STATE WITH A PER. LIKE THIS BECAUSE WE KNOW THE SOME PARTS THAT. IT IS A VIEW WAY UP ROLLED. A MEDICALLY- PAID THE DETECTIVE THERE'D BE A MIL T. YOU I THINK IT'S- TO BE MY- MORE- TO. SO I BE IN. IN HOW HOW DO SOME OF THOSE THINGS. AS WE HAVE BEEN- DEPENDING MORE AND MORE ON TELEHEALTH. BUT WE STILL HAVE ACTUAL FOOD THAT TO GET DISTRIBUTED TO PEOPLE. AND WHERE THE SOME OF THE BEST WAYS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. OCTOPATH. AT THE- YOU- AND THIS IS PERHAPS A- CALLING. SO MAYBE A WILL SPEND TOO MUCH TIME TRYING TO ANSWER. IT BUT JUST PUT IT OUT THERE- SIGN. SO FIRST OF ALL NUMBER IS. IN LOOSER. BY ALSO. UNDER PROPOSED. STRUCTURE ITSELF ALL. BY THE PLAY. SO THE PLAN INSIDE. TO PURSUE ONE OR NO- AND- SO I GUESS THE- COR I HAVE AROUND MEDICALLY. MEAL IS THAT NOW I THIS. IS FOR THE PIE TO FILL GAP- D. DO YOU SEE WELL ITS FIRST- SO AFTER THAT WHEN THE I ABOUT THE PERFECT WAY RESTRICTION IN LIEU PROGRAM IS JUST EACH PLAN GETS WHICH IN LIEU THEIR AGAIN DO OR NOT DO ITS WE HAVE OF. IS THERE SOME FOR THE TAKING SOME LIKE MEDICALLY ME AND ACT- REQUIRING PLAN. THAT HAVE POPPED. WHICH THIS WOULD BE OF. BENEFIT TO. DO THAT. GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW FROM THE- SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY. HOW WELL. THIS IN LIEU PRO MAYBE IS A AS SAMPLE TO ALL THE OTHER. WOULD WORK IN WE DID IT MORE SYSTEM- SO THAT I GETS A BIT CHEN WE- YOU KNOW IT'S IF WE HAVE SOMETHING DOING AT SOME PLANS NOW DOING AT AND YOU YOU'RE- BACK TO SEE. YOU'RE SEEN PAY IN SOME THEM LIVE IN ONE SIDE OF THE BOARD AND SOME ON THE OTHER. AND THEN SAY WELL OKAY IF YOU WERE DO YOU LIVE I GUESS YOU LIVE YOU GET THIS IF YOU LIVE THERE SORRY DON'T- AND- EVEN THOUGH THE THREAT OF THE SECOND. ARE THE SAME SO CAN PERHAPS SPEAK TO. FOR A QUICK THE FOR OF THIS PILOT AND IN. AND OUT TOGETHER WITH CAL AIM TERMS OF THIS IDEA THAT THE PLANS ACTUALLY DECIDE WHETHER D GONNA DO IN THE SERVICE OR NOT I MEAN DO YOU SEE MEDICALLY TAILORED MEALS BASICALLY BEING IS STILL UP TO THE PLANS ENTIRELY OR- WHAT- DAYS SO THIS PILOT AND IT'S ALL THE PLAN SAY THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT ONE. SO WHAT WHAT IS A PILOT SAID IN RELATION- THE IN LIEU PROGRAMS CURRENTLY PROPOSED. FOR CALLING. SO THE- IS ONLY. A SELECT COUNTY TODAY RIGHT NOW. AND AVAILABLE ONLY JUST AT HER FAILURE. ON THE PROPOSAL BY. YOU IS TWO X. IT TO- TOWN- TO. OTHER DIAGNOSE- BUT WHEN IT COMES THE- BY IN LOWER SERVICES THAT IS UP. WORK THAT. BONTA FOR THE MANAGER CARE PLAN AND FOR THE BENEFIT YEAR TRICKS. ON THE LOWER SERVICES. THE IDEA BEHIND IT TAKE UP HIGH THAT WAS A IF YOU CAN. IN ITS- IT YOU TO OTHER. IS TO HAVE. A MORE OF AN AND- FOR INVERSE. PER GET. FOR MANAGED PLANS TO ABLE TO CON. WITH THE IN DID YOU FOR THE L. THE WEBSTER. AND TO BE BRIDGE. OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE. THAT THE PIE PROGRAM AREN'T IN. OFF EIGHT COUNTIES AND SO ON THEY DID HOW TO EXPAND WITHIN THE- THAT THEY HAD- TO PASS. IN A TO GET THAT UP IN A ROW. AT TO BE BUILT BETWEEN. THIS AND THE LOWER SERVICE. IN K. DERE WOULD BE THAT- THAT THAT WOULD BE A- FOR THE SPANISH CARE PLANS. YOUR AROUND IN LIEU OF SIR. BEING OFF. AND BY. WE CAN. UNDER HAT- AS MENTIONED IT IS A RIGHT. OF THE- GOVERNMENT. FOR THE A LITTLE SERVICE APPROACH SINCE WE'RE NOT AT EIGHT. CAPACITY TO ADD AS A BENEFIT. A BIT OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT ALSO. MY THE I. OF A THE IN THE OF SERVICE. IS TO GET SERVER THAT HE- HAVE NOT OFFERED. THROUGH MEDICARE BILL. STATEWIDE IN FIRST. INCOME WITH PROVIDER. OF AND LINKAGES TO. MAKE THEM A- AND- WHICH YOU WOULD. HAVE THE DISPARITY ACROSS THE STATE OF. I'M SO THAT IS INTENTION OF. A VIA LOS ARE IS. THAT CAN. OF BRINGING UP THE INFORMATION. SO THAT CAN OF. MAKE IT A MEDICARE BENEFITS YOU WOULDN'T. ISSUES COUNTY TO COUNTY. FOR BE DON'T HAVE THAT TODAY- ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OF THAT IS THE INTENT OF BUILDING IN FIRST. OVER TIME. THOUGH WAS TO SIGN. OF THE COUNTIES ARE CURRENTLY HAVE SAID PILOTS ONLY IN CERTAIN COUNTY WE'RE GOING. TO GET. IT'S IN RELATION TO. OUR FILES ACCOUNT SO YOU HAVE A PLAN IN THAT COUNTY AND THEY SAY WELL YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN DOING MEDICALLY TAILORED MEALS THAT MEANS. IN THAT COUNTY WHERE IT CURRENTLY EXISTS AS A PILOT. IT GETS DROPPED OFF. WE STOPPED DOING IT HOW DO WE SET A STANDARD UP AS A SEPARATE INDEPENDENT PROGRAM- SO. ARE YOU JUST HOPING THAT A WHOLE THE PLANS THAT ARE IN THE COUNTIES WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE PILOT. THEY'RE GOING TO BE DOING IT- THE LARA DEPARTMENT WOULD BE ABLE TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO WE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BROKER RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE PILOT- PROVIDER. AND THE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO ENSURE MANY OF THE MANAGED CARE PLANS ALREADY HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ENTITIES TODAY IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THIS IN SOME OF OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE ALREADY PROVIDING THESE SERVICES EVEN THOUGH. IT'S NOT A PART OF THEIR MEDICARE CAPITATION RATE- TODAY. IN ANTICIPATION AND BECAUSE OF THE COST SAVINGS THAT IS OFTEN TIED TO MEDICALLY TAILORED MEALS. SO THE DEPARTMENT WOULD ENCOURAGE BUT WE CANNOT REQUIRE. AS MENTIONED EARLIER AND THEN THE PILOT WOULD STILL EXIST UNTIL THE FUNDING- IS COMPLETELY DONE AS AN- AVAILABLE THROUGH THE BUDGET- IF FOR SOME REASON I MEAN IS YOUR PLAN DID NOT. CONTRACT FOR THOSE SERVICES THIS IS A CLEAR FINAL PLAN DECLINES. THE BENEFICIARIES OF THAT PLAN WHOSE IS THE COUNTY BOARD THE PILOT CAN STILL ACCESS THE MEDICALLY TAILORED MEALS THROUGH THE PILOT INDEPENDENT OF THE PLAN. THAT IS CORRECT OKAY. I JUST WANNA CLARIFY THAT OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU OKAY- FISH. NUMBER NUMBER EIGHT SUMMER NUMBER NINE SO WE ARE. PERFECT ALL RIGHT SO THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES TO PERMANENTLY REMOVE ALL SUSPENSIONS OF PROPERTY SIX PAYMENTS AND OPTIONAL BENEFITS CURRENTLY IN LAW. THE NAY REVISION ALSO INCLUDES COSTS TO ELIMINATE THE AB NINETY SEVEN A RATE FREEZE FOR ICF G. AND- A FREESTANDING PEDIATRIC SUB ACUTE FACILITIES. INCREASE REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR THESE FACILITIES SHALL ACCOUNT FOR AND BE INCLUSIVE OF PROPERTY SIX SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS OF IT THE BUDGET INCLUDES TWENTY FOUR MILLION TOTAL FUNDS FOR THIS PURPOSE I'M ELEVEN A MILLION GENERAL FUND. A FEW PIECES IN REGARDS TO THIS RATE AS WE HAVE HAD QUESTIONS- FINANCIAL BENEFITS FOR THE FACILITIES REALLY YOU KNOW INCLUDING ACS ESTIMATES THATTHE PROBE PROPOSAL WILL RESULT IN AN AVERAGE OF THE 3% PER DIEM RATE INCREASE ABOVE WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE JANUARY BUDGET FOR ICF EDIE'S. I'M INCLUDING THE PROP FIFTY SIX SUPPLEMENTAL WITH THE RATE CHANGE BEING EFFECTIVE ON THE RATE YOU'RE BEGINNING AUGUST FIRST OF TWENTY ONE ADDITIONALLY THE PROPOSAL WOULD UNFREEZE THE RATE ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND WOULD RESULT IN THE RATE BEING UPDATED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS MOVING FORWARD. I TO REFLECT THE UPDATED COST REPORT SUBMITTED BY FACILITIES ALLOWING FOR ONGOING INCREASES THE RATE METHODOLOGY WOULD INCORPORATE- UPDATED COST REPORT DATA TRENDED FORWARD FOR THE RATE YEAR ALONG WITH OUT ON TO ACCOUNT FOR COSTS TO COMPLY WITH ANY FEDERAL OR STATE MANDATES THAT WERE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE COST REPORTS. ADDITIONALLY THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES ON THE PROPERTY SIX FUNDED SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AS A PART OF THE CALCULATION FOR THE TOTAL UNFROZEN RATE IN ESSENCE THE PROPERTY SIX FUNDING BECOMES A PART OF THE UNFROZEN RIGHT. AND LASTLY IN REGARDS TO THESE FACILITIES AS THESE ARE SERVING A 100% MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES THE REVENUE FROM THE MEDIC CAL PROGRAM IS CRITICAL TO THEIR PHYSICAL CONDITION WHICH IS WHY WE BELIEVE IT IS AN IMPORTANT TO UNFREEZE THE RIGHT METHODOLOGY ON GOING. TO ENSURE THAT THE REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS ARE ABLE TO REFLECT THE COST OF PROVIDING SERVICES GOING FORWARD. AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR JOHNSON. I WE NO CAN AT THE THIS BURKE RECOGNIZING THAT THAT CUT WAS LARGELY A BUDGETARY SOLUTION DURING THE LAST RECESSION AND SELL WOULD CERTAINLY DEFERRED A LEGISLATIVE PROVOCATIVE BUT NO I HAVE NO CONCERNS SPECIFICALLY TO THE APPROACH BY THE ADMINISTRATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DON'T HAVE ISSUES WITH THIS EITHER DOCTOR PAN. SO I'M GLAD WE'RE FINALLY ON DOING SOMETHING ANOTHER WEEK ANOTHER RECESSION CUT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY MOVING ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TEN. HELLO HELLO- AS A PART OF THE IMAGE MINISTRATIONS PROPOSAL TO EXPAND TELEHEALTH FLEXIBILITIES UTILIZED DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY- WHILE PROVIDING ASSURANCES OF APPROPRIATE ACCESS TO IN PERSON CARE DCS. I'M IS PROPOSING TO ESTABLISH A RATE FOR THE AUDIO ONLY TELEHEALTH SERVICES- AS SERVICES RENDERED FOR FEE FOR SERVICE INDIVIDUALS- ACT MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY IN OUR TELEHEALTH THIS WOULD GO ACROSS FOR. MANAGED CARE AS WELL- AND WE WOULD BE OFFERING A FEW TERRIBLE ALTERNATIVE TO THE PPS RATE FOR CLINICS TO MAINTAIN. THE SERVICES- FOR ACCURACY IS ALSO JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT'S CLEAR FOR NON FQHC PROVIDER 65% OF THE MEDICARE FEE FOR SERVICE RATE. I'M IS WHAT WOULD BE PROPOSED THAT WOULD BE FOR ABOUT MANAGED CARE AND FEE FOR SERVICE- AS WERE REQUIRING- THAT BE CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL. AS WELL AS FOR FQHCS THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE AUDIO ON EACH AT A COMPARABLE ALTERNATIVE PPS RATES SIMILAR TO A 65% RATE IF YOU FOR SERVICE. HOWEVER WOULD JUST KNOW AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN OTHER HEARINGS THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO ACCURACY IS BEING WILLING TO WAIVE THE PPS ENOUGH GETTING FEDERAL APPROVAL TO WAIVE THE PPS EMERGENT PAY THE ALTERNATIVE PPS RATE. ON THAT PIECE. WE ADDED SOME ADDITIONAL UP COMPONENTS TO THE TELEHEALTH PROPOSAL- MAINLY- REQUIRING THAT ONLY PROVIDERS LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA WORK ORDER COMMUNITIES- AND ABLE TO PROVIDE IN PERSON SERVICES TO EACH OF THE CLIENTS SERVED BY SYNCHRONIZED AUDIO ON THE TELEHEALTH SERVICES. I CAN CLAIM THE MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR THOSE SERVICES I'M AND DH YES WILL BE WORKING TO CONSULT WITH SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS IN REGARDS TO WHICH ANY UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS. FOR TELEHEALTH SERVICES THAT NEED TO BE CONSIDERED AS WE MOVE FORWARD OUT OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY- AS WE HAVE ADDED A LARGE NUMBER OF TELEHEALTH MODALITIES- IN THE- YEAR TO ACCESS IN THE FUTURE. AND HAPPY. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR XIA ANYTHING ON THIS ONE. WE DO HAVE SOME COMMENTS BUT I DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MAY HAVE HAD THEIR OKAY THE FIRST OKAY- THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. THANK YOU NIGHT BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THERE ARE JUST A COUPLE POINTS THAT WE REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE. WITH REGARD TO BOTH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THEN NEVER. UNTIL HEALTH PROPOSALS. ONE THE ADMINISTRATION REALLY SEES THIS PROPOSAL AS AN EFFORT TO BE PROACTIVE. GIVEN THAT WE'RE ASSUMING THE END OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY- AS OF DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND SO WITH THE CONCLUSION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY OUR VARIOUS KOBELCO DATUM REGENCY WAIVERS AND THE MEDICAL PROGRAM WILL COME TO AN END. AND THEREFORE THE CURRENT TELEHEALTH LOOKS ABILITIES THROUGHOUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WILL CONCLUDE- MOREOVER AND GIVEN THAT WE ALREADY HAD VARIOUS TELEHEALTH FLEXIBILITIES PRIOR TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WE REALLY SEE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND THE NEIGHBOR VISION PROPOSALS AS UPDATES AND ARE NECESSARILY PREMATURE- AND THEN WE ALSO JUST REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE PROPOSED TELEHEALTH POLICIES BEFORE US TODAY- PROVIDE BILL CLINTON CONTINUITY- BUT THEN REALLY APPROPRIATELY BALANCED BOTH FLEXIBILITY. ALONG WITH HIGH STANDARDS OF CARE- AND THEN LASTLY YOU KNOW AS THE ADMINISTRATION- RECEIVES MORE DATA FOR EXAMPLE UTILIZATION DATA WITH REGARD TO TELL HEALTH WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE UPDATES TO THE TELEHEALTH POLICY AS APPROPRIATE. IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER SHE TO. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR- JUST- TO SOME COMMENTS TO MAKE ON THIS ON THIS ISSUE- WE WOULD NOTE THAT WE RELEASED RECENTLY AN ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY MEDIC HEALTH TELEHEALTH PROPOSAL- IN THAT ANALYSIS WE FOUND THAT WE FOUND THAT GIVEN THAT MUCH ABOUT TELEHEALTH SERVICE DELIVERY IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD IN TERMS OF RELATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF CARE ESPECIALLY ACROSS DIFFERENT SERVICE MODALITIES- YOU KNOW THE OVERALL FISCAL IMPACT OF MAKING TELEHEALTH SERVICES. MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE IS NOT GENERALLY NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD- AND HOW DIFFERENT PAYMENT RATES AFFECT TELEHEALTH SERVICES BEING PROVIDED IS ALSO NOT SORT OF CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD- GIVEN THESE CONSIDERATIONS YOU KNOW WE FOUND IT WAS PREMATURE TO ESTABLISH A MEDIC CAL TELEHEALTH POLICY ON A PERMANENT BASIS AND SUGGESTED A TIME LIMITED EXTENSION OF THE CURRENT MEDICARE TELEHEALTH FLEXIBILITIES- IN FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO SORT OF DIRECT THE ACS TO CONDUCT A WORK GROUP TO. DEVELOP OPTIONS FOR LONGER LONGER TERM MEDICARE TELEHEALTH POLICY- WE ALSO NOTED IN THAT ANALYSIS SOME CONCERNS WE HAD ABOUT DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO CARE AS A RESULT OF THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY PROPOSAL- IN PARTICULAR AMONG MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES BETWEEN THOSE WHO ACCESS CARE THROUGH HEALTH CENTERS AND THOSE DO NOT AND THOSE WHO DO NOT- ESPECIALLY FOR AUDIO ONLY SERVICES. GENERALLY WE FIND THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE PROPOSAL TO BE AN IMPROVEMENT OVER THE JANUARY PROPOSAL IT PROVIDES SOME FURTHER DETAIL ON WHAT PAYMENT RATES FOR AUDIO ONLY SERVICES WILL BE- AND WE FIND THE ADMINISTRATION'S INDICATION THAT IT WILL PROPOSE A COVERING AUDIO ONLY SERVICES AT HEALTH CENTERS ON A DISTINCT FEE SCHEDULE FROM PPS- TO BE A REASONABLE APPROACH- WE JUST KNOW THAT FEDERAL APPROVAL OF THIS ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODEL REPEAT REMAINS UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME- WHILE WE DO FIND THE GOVERNOR'S NAY REVISION PROPOSAL TO BE AN IMPROVEMENT OVER THE JANUARY MEDICARE TELEHEALTH PROPOSAL. WE DO STILL FIND THAT OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS REMAIN FOR EXAMPLE- AND BE ADMINISTRATION STILL DOES NOT PROPOSED TO EXTEND THE NEW. REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING BENEFIT TO HELL STATE HEALTH CENTERS. WHICH WE FOR REASONS. ABOUT DISPARITIES IN CARE OF- MEDIC BENEFICIARIES ON THIS WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER EXTENDING THIS BENEFIT TO HEALTH CENTERS- IN ADDITION YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION HAS STILL NOT RELEASED A FISCAL IMPACT OF ITS MEDICARE TELEHEALTH PROPOSAL. YOU KNOW WE FIND THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL THAT THE PROPOSAL WILL RESULT IN ADDITIONAL ONGOING COSTS GIVEN THE LIKELIHOOD OF INCREASE SERVICE UTILIZATION. AS A RESULT OF TELEHEALTH EXPANSION- THE RELEASE OF THE FISCAL ESTIMATE WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL- FINALLY WE FIND THAT YOU KNOW GIVEN OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS REMAIN SURROUNDING SERVICE QUALITY THE IMPACT OF PAYMENT RATES ON. SERVICE ACCESS AND OVERALL FISCAL IMPACT WHEN IT COMES TO TELEHEALTH SERVICE EXPANSIONS- WE DO STILL FIND THAT ESTABLISHING A MEDIC CAL TELEHEALTH POLICY ON A PERMANENT BASIS REMAINS. PREMATURE ONE OPTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER WOULD BE TO ADD A SUNSET DATE- PERHAPS SEVERAL YEARS INTO THE FUTURE TO THE PROPOSED STATUTORY CHANGE WHICH WOULD IMPLEMENT THIS PROPOSAL TO ALLOW FOR. I'M SORT OF AN EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED POLICY AND PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECONSIDER THE STATE'S ONGOING MEDICARE TELEHEALTH POLICY. AS MORE INFORMATION PARTICULARLY AROUND SERVICE UTILIZATION- AND THE IMPACT OF PAYMENT RATES ON ON UTILIZATION ACCESS TO CARE AND BECOMES MORE AVAILABLE. I THOSE ARE ALL OF OUR OFFICES COMMENTS AT THIS TIME BUT HAPPY TO SORT OF PROVIDE FURTHER ASSISTANCE WHERE NEEDED. OKAY THERE'S A THAT THAT SUNSET MAKES A MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME I THINK WHEN WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE ALL WE'RE STILL FINDING OUT SO MUCH. ABOUT TELEHEALTH AND THE EFFECTIVENESS AND THE ISSUES AROUND ACCESS- AS FAR AS IT RELATES TO TECHNOLOGY- AND I KNOW WHAT THE CLINICS HAVE NOT BEEN PLEASED BUT- ALSO WE ARE ALSO VERY PLEASED THAT. THAT THE GOVERNOR HEARD THE MINISTRATION HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR AFTER JANUARY PROPOSAL THAT- THAT IT PROBABLY WASN'T GOOD TO JUST TAKE OUT AUDIO ALL THE WAY- BUT WE'RE STILL NOT AT AT PARITY WITH THAT SO I THINK THESE THAT THAT'LL BE A TOPIC FOR ONGOING CONVERSATIONS. BUT I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF A SUNSET DR PAN. YEAH IT'S- POLICY THIS. IS BETTER THAN WAS ORIGINALLY POSE FOR WE DON'T HAVE AUDIO BUT I I'M I'M CONCERNED THIS- DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH- FOR A COUPLE REASONS- YOU KNOW- SO MOST OF POORLY ACTUALLY IS AN ACCESS ISSUE- WE KNOW THAT. DURING CODED BUT EATEN WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THE CALL THAT I SHOULD SAY IS THAT- THAT. PEOPLE HELP- WE HAVE RIGHT ACCESS AS SHE IN SOME WAYS BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE AUDIO- TOO MANY MORE PEOPLE- PARTICULAR PEOPLE ARE VULNERABLE RIGHT IN THAT IT ACTUALLY PEOPLE POINTED OUT WHAT WE'RE DOING TELEHEALTH HOW IMPORTANT WAS THAT WE INCLUDED AUDIO ONLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE A LOT OF. I MEAN OTHERWISE TELL ME WHAT WHAT IS CALLED TELEHEALTH AND- IT ENDED UP AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT EQUIPMENT AT THE PROVIDER AND IT'S A MEDICAL AT THE EQUIPMENT THAT THE PERSON HAS AT THE OTHER END RIGHT- AND WHAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE BUT ALSO IT HAS TO DO WITH THINGS LIKE PRIVACY. RIGHT SO YOU'RE YOU'RE HOLED UP WITH SOMEBODY AND THE NOW YOU HAVE TO GO TO A COMPUTER WITH A VIDEO WELL AND IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING VERY SENSITIVE LIKE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH OTHER TYPES OF THINGS IT'S HARD TO MAINTAIN PRIVACY IS SOMEONE CAN'T. OVER HERE ARE LOOK OVER YOUR SHOULDER AND SEE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT- YOU OF THOSE SSUES- THAT THE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THINGS LIKE THAT GREAT SO- AUDIO ONLY GIVES YOU MORE TOOLS AND ALSO IMPROVE PRIVACY ACCESS. AND WE LEARNED THAT DURING COLD AND SO WE'RE KIND OF DISCOURAGING THAT NOW THAT KIND OF ACCESS. THE OTHER PART IS PERHAPS MORE VOTES LONG STANDING- BUT GREAT ABOUT AND HEALTH CARE IS THAT HOW WE ALWAYS SEEM TO UNDERVALUE COGNITIVE SERVICES. AND THAT THIS IS A CHALLENGE OF RUN INTO PRIMARY CARE RIGHT. PROCEDURES ARE OFTEN VERY WELL REIMBURSED BUT- COGNITIVE SERVICE AND TO FIND KIND OF IRONIC BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU WHEN I GO. GET LEGAL ADVICE. MY ATTORNEY- I SEEM TO GET BILL WHEN I ON THE- FOR THE AMOUNT OF TIME I TALK TO ACCOUNTANT. THING YET DISPOSITION AND I GET YOU KNOW THE PEDIATRICIAN I GET PHONE CALLS FROM PATIENTS- FOR SOME REASON THAT'S WOULD BE FREE. IS IT. THE AMOUNT OF TRAINING I'VE HAD NOT HAD VALUE. WHY IS IT. WHY DON'T WE VALUE THAT KNOWLEDGE THAT PRIMARY CARE KNOWLEDGE THE SAME WAY AND SO WE WONDER WHY DOCTORS GO INTO SPECIALTIES AND NOT INTO PRIMARY CARE- AND THAT IS SO- I THINK WE SENT WERE SENDING OUT WELL MOST IMPORTANTLY THE ACCESS ISSUE I MEAN IT'S NOT ABOUT IT'S NOT ABOUT THE PROVIDERS IT'S MORE ABOUT THE PATIENTS BUT BUT I THINK WE ALSO THINK WE CAN MESSAGE WE SENT TO YOU KNOW AND WE TALK ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO REDUCE HEALTHCARE COSTS WILL GET MORE PRIMARY CARE SUPPORT AND FOR GOD SAKES THAN. WHAT YOU VALUE PRIMARY CARE THEN TELL US WHAT WE'RE WORSE TAYLOR SAID FOR THE THINGS WE DO RIGHT AND NOT WHAT WE WORTH A TASTE FOR THE THINGS WE DID WITH THAT EXPERTISE IS IMPORTANT AND- SO YOU KNOW IT'S NOT 65% SHOULD BE 100% AT THE THEN OF COURSE IF WE THINK ABOUT CLINICAL JUDGMENT SO NEEDS TO BE FACE TO FACE IN FRONT US TO DO AN EXAM THEN THAT SHOULD BE OUR CALL. RIGHT FOR US TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE IF YOU THINK WE'RE TRYING TO TEACH YOU IN THAT WAY THEN WE HAVE ANOTHER CONVERSATION WE NEED TO HAVE. OTHERWISE IT SHOULD BE UP TO OUR JUDGMENT AS TO. WHAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO TO PROVIDE THE QUALITY OF CARE TO THE PATIENTS. AND- AND CERTAINLY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT BUT WE SHOULD BE ASSUMING UP IN THE FRONT BY SAYING ALL WE ONLY GET QUALITY CARE JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE'S OVER THE PHONE. AND SO THE I GUESS THAT'S MY ISSUE WITH THIS PROPOSAL WHICH IS AGAIN IMPROVING FROM JANUARY BUT- YOU KNOW I. I I'M CONCERNED THAT- IS THAT FIRST OF ALL WE'RE- NOW GOING TO TAKE AWAY ACCESS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ABLE TO GET ACCESS BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO FINALLY. PROVIDE THIS LEVEL OF ACCESS THROUGH. TELL THE TO TELEHEALTH THROUGH AUDIO ONLY- AND THEN ALSO- WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALSO SEND THE RIGHT KIND OF MESSAGE ABOUT. HOW WE VALUE THE YOU KNOW HOW WE RELATIVELY VALUE VERY SERVICE AND BY THE WAY BEHAVIORAL ALTURAS OF SUCH ABOUT PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS RIGHT. IT'S ABOUT BEHAVIOR HEALTH SO IF WE PROVIDE COUNSELING OVER THE PHONE THROUGH AUDIO ONLY. IF WE CAN'T DOES THAT NOW SIXTY ONLY 65% OF THE- FOR SOME REASON I MEAN I'M NOT SURE M. OUT. VISUAL MADE HELP BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT AUTOMATICALLY DROPPED THAT MUCH. AND AGAIN SOME DAY THERE'S AN ACCESS ISSUE WHEN THAT SENSITIVE- SO THAT THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT I'M I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT IN TERMS OF SAYING THAT WE SHOULD JUST DO THANK YOU SIDE. I DON'T THINK THERE'S A QUESTION I THINK IT WAS JUST A THINGS FOR THINGS FOR YOU TO HEAR. AND I WOULD AGREED AS A BEHAVIOR HEALTH PROVIDER SOMETIMES- PEOPLE'S ANXIETY OR CONDITION BECAUSE THE IT IS VERY HARD FOR THEM TO MAKE EYE CONTACT AND- AND THE PHONE IS A MUCH BETTER WAY AND WE'VE WE'VE COME TO UNDERSTAND THAT- WAS ZOOMING IN SCHOOL SOME KIDS JUST DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE CAMERA ON BECAUSE- THAT- LIKE WITH THE BACKGROUND LOOKS LIKE IN YOUR ROOMS PERHAPS OR- WHEREVER THERE HAPPENED TO BE SITTING- SO- WE KNOW THAT THE- THE- SCHOOLS ARE STILL. YOU KNOW I MEAN IT DOESN'T COUNT OF SOMEONE'S CAMERAS OFFER ON. THEM SO ANYWAY OKAY MOVING ON TO ISSUE NUMBER. ELEVEN MEDICATION THERAPY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.

ISSUE NUMBER THIRTEEN SEVENTEEN- SAN MATEO COUNTY AND I WILL SAY AT THE STAFF WAS BRIEFED ME ON THIS AND SEE THAT WE GOT FROM YOU SAN MATEOCOUNTY AS A PILOT PLACE OF COURSE I SAID SAN MATEO COUNTY IS NOT SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY SO HE PICKED A NICE ONE FOR ALL THE PILOTS BUT THEN YOU GOT TO EXPAND INTO THE REST THE STATE SO ANYWAY LET'S HEAR ABOUT THE SAN MATEO COUNTY DENTAL INTEGRATION. PILOT YOUR STAFF ARE CORRECT WE OFTEN DO YOU USE SAN MATTEO A PILOT BUT I THINK IT IS REFLECTIVE OF THE DEDICATION FROM.
