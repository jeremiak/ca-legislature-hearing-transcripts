ABOUT THAT AS WE GO THROUGH -- SO THE FIRST WHETHER WE HAVE HERE TODAY -- IS A SLIGHTLY RECENTLY PRESENTED TO THE STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE IT'S SIMPLY TIMELINE OF HOW WE'VE GOTTEN TO WHERE WE ARE LEGISLATIVELY WITH REGARDS INDUSTRIAL HAVE -- SO IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AS YOUR LIKELY WHERE -- WE HAD THE CALIFORNIA SO HAVE FARMING ACT SB FIFTY FIVE SIXTY SIX IT WAS PASSED THAT ESTABLISH DIVISION TWENTY FOUR THE FEAR CULTURAL CODE. OF AND ALSO DEFINED INDUSTRIAL HEMP IN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE -- HER HAD A PROVISION AT THE END OF THE BILL AND THE END OF THE LAW THAT SAID THAT SHALL NOT BECOME OPERATIVE IN LESS AUTHORIZED UNDER FEDERAL LAW -- IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THERE WAS THE TWENTY FOURTEEN FARM BILL OF THE FEDERAL AGRICULTURAL ACTIVE TWENTY FOURTEEN WHICH PROVIDED. FOR PILOT PROGRAMS -- FOR INDUSTRIAL HEMP AND RESEARCH BE CONDUCTED BY -- COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES -- IN WITH SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARDS TO ADD AS A CALLED RESEARCH ON INDUSTRIAL HEMP. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN OF THE ADULT USE OF MARIJUANA ACT PROP SIXTY FOUR AMENDED DIVISION TWENTY FOUR THE FEET ARE CULTURAL CODE. TO REMOVE THE UPPER PROVISION AND TO SIMPLY STATED IT THE LAW WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF JANUARY FIRST -- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND MADE SOME OTHER MINOR CHANGES THROUGHOUT THE BILL ARE THROUGHOUT THE LAW. AND THEN LAST YEAR WITH TWO MAJOR CHANGES ONE THAT OCCURRED HERE -- THAT'S BUTTE FORTINO -- NINE WHICH MADE SOME SEND A SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES -- TO DIVISION FIVE FOR THE FINANCE CULTURAL CODE INCLUDING ALLOWING COUNTIES TO ESTABLISH OUR OWN FEES -- ALLOWING CDFA TO ESTABLISH TAMPLIN TESTING PROCEDURES -- AND THEN ALLOWING CDFA TO ESTABLISH ARE VOLATILE PILOT PROGRAM -- AS AUTHORIZED IN THE TWENTY FOURTEEN FARM BILL AND THEN REQUIRING ESTABLISHED AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS AS DEFINED IN THE LAW TO NOTIFY THE COUNTY AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONERS PRIOR TO PLANTING -- SHORTLY AFTER THE BILL WAS SIGNED THEN -- THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN FARM BILL WAS PASSED WHICH INCLUDED -- SUBSTANTIAL PROVISIONS WITH REGARDS TO INDUSTRIAL HEMP AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL I REMOVED HIM FROM THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT I'M SURE YOU'LL BE HEARING MORE ABOUT THIS FROM PATRICK LATER. ON ALL THREE STATES AND TRIBES TO REGULATE INDUSTRIAL HEMP CULTIVATION A A REQUIRES USDA TO ESTABLISH NATIONAL A NATIONAL REGULATION REGULATORY PROGRAM -- AND THEN ALSO ALLOWS FOR THE INTERSTATE MOVEMENT OF HAPPEN AND PRODUCTS -- INSIST BRIEFLY HOW WE GOT TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY SO AFTER THE THE CHANGES THAT WERE MADE TO PROP -- VIA PROP SIXTY FOUR IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN SEE IF ESTABLISH THE INDUSTRIAL AND PROGRAM. WAS ESTABLISHED WITHIN THE PLAN HEALTH AND PASTOR VENGEANCE SERVICES DIVISION AND IS OVERSEEN BY THAT DIVISIONS NURSERY SETON COTTON PROGRAM -- CULTIVATION AND CULTIVATION OF INDUSTRIAL -- IS GENERALLY SUBJECT TO THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS OF OTHER AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES EXCEPT THE DIVISION TWENTY FOUR ALSO REQUIRES REGISTRATION CULTIVATION SITES WITH THE COUNTY OF CALL TO COMMISSIONER. AND TESTING OF EACH CROP -- FOR TEACH THE CONTENT -- AND THE REASON IS PLACE WITHIN THE NURSING CON PROGRAM IS THAT IT IS IN SOME WAYS SIMILAR TO OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE ALREADY OVER SEEN THERE. FOR INSTANCE NURSERY LICENSING -- SEED REGISTRATION WHERE PEOPLE HAVE TO GET LICENSED OR REGISTERED AND OURSELVES A FEW PRODUCTS OR SEEDS -- WE COLLECT FEES MANAGING THE MANAGING VISOR MORE THINGS THAT NATURE -- ENTER CURRENTLY THIS PROGRAM HAS -- TO FULL TIME STAFF MEMBERS -- IN THIS IN THE PROCESS OF HIRING A FEW MORE MITCHELL ADDRESS A MINUTE -- IN THEIR PROJECTED EXPENDITURES FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR ARE THREE UNDER NINETEEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED TWELVE DOLLARS -- BUT THAT INCLUDES AN ENCUMBRANCE OF FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR PLANNED COUNTY CONTRACTS AS WE GET GOING WITH REGISTRATION -- SO IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN OF THE BACK A LITTLE BIT ROM WHERE REFER STARTED -- THE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE'VE DONE WHICH AGAIN TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT A SECOND IS THAT WE PROPOSED TO DOT SECTION FORTY NINE HUNDRED IN TITLE THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS. THAT WOULD ESTABLISH A REGISTRATION FEE -- WE ALSO ADOPTED TO OTHER REGULATION SECTION FORTY AND TWENTY FOUR AND TWENTY ONE WHICH ESTABLISH. A AN AMENDMENT TO THE APPROVED THE LIST OF C. CULTIVARS THAT ARE LISTEDIN THE FEW NARROW CULTURAL CODE AND THEN ALSO ESTABLISHES A PROCEDURE TO MAKE FURTHER CHANGES.

AND AS WE START TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP MORE AND MORE ANSWERS WE CAN TRY TO GET MORE -- PROMOTION -- OUT REACH MATERIALS OUT THERE TO THE PUBLIC INTO THE COUNTIES TO PROVIDE THEM WITH FURTHER GUIDANCE AND FURTHER INFORMATION ON HOW DO. IN MINISTER IN FALL OF THIS LAW CHECK [inaudible] YEAH. THANK YOU SENATOR WILK. I HAVE A COMMENT THIS TIME SO I I APPRECIATE ALL YOUR EFFORTS IN TERMS OF HAVING OPEN COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE AG COMMISSIONERS ARE WE HAD AND ONE OF MY COUNTIES WE HAD A A COMMISSIONER THEY CLEARLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND. WHAT WAS GOING ON AND YOU GUYS DID A PHENOMENAL JOB WITH ABOUT FORTY EIGHT HOURS -- GETTING IT ALL HANDLED SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR GUISES EFFORTS ON THAT SO THANK YOU THANK YOU. IT'S GOOD HERE THANK YOU -- SO OUTSIDE OF THE VISION -- TWENTY FOUR WE DO HAVE A FEW OTHER REGULATORY CONCERNS WITH REGARDS TO INDUSTRIAL HEMP CULTIVATION -- AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE THE OTHER OF LAWS AND RULES -- THAT APPLY TO OTHER AGRICULTURE MONIES TO APPLY TO YOU AND US ON AS WELL -- SO WE HAVE CONCERNS AND WE ARE KEEPING AN EYE OUT FOR THESE PARTICULAR ISSUES -- NEW PESTS AND DISEASES FOUND ON HAVE BEEN CANNABIS -- AS THIS IS A RELATIVELY. NEW AGAIN CROP -- THEIR RESEARCH IS JUST NOW BEGINNING ON AND BEGAN AS FAR AS WHAT PESTS AND DISEASES WILL -- AFFECT. CANNABIS PLANTS AND SO WE ARE -- YOU MAINTAINING AGAIN COMMUNICATION WITH OUR WITH OUR SITE IN BOTH OUR INTERNAL SCIENTISTS AS WELL AS AND WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND TRYING TO KEEP AN EYE ON THOSE THINGS AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. WE EXPECT WILL PROGRESS GREATLY OVER THE NEXT YEAR TWO YEARS FIVE YEARS AT CETERA -- IN ORDER TO SELL HEPPNER SHE'S TALKING LICENSES OWNERSHIP STOCK IS REQUIRED IMAGE IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER INDUSTRIAL HEMP REYES I REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS -- WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING -- THE APPLICATION CALIFORNIA C. Là TO THE SALE OF INDUSTRIAL HEMP AND THAT SALE AND MOVEMENT OF INDUSTRIAL HEMP SEEDS -- WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL APPLY WE LIKE WE NEED TO PURSUE REGULATIONS ARE TO FULLY APPLY THE COMFORTING Là IT IS CURRENTLY ADDRESSED IN THE FEDERAL SEAT ACT -- SO THERE'S PRECEDENT THERE AND SHOULD BE A HOPEFULLY SIMPLE CHANGE UNDER THAT IS SOMETHING WE WORKING ON THIS YEAR -- WE HAVE RECEIVED BROAD INTEREST IN ORGANIC CERTIFICATION AND WE ARE ACTIVELY TRYING TO WORK WITH OURS A STATE ORGANIC PROGRAM. ON TRYING TO ADDRESS THE THE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS OF THEIR RECEIVING AND TRY TO COORDINATE WITH THEM WITH REGARDS TO ORGANIC CERTIFICATION AND ASSIST ANYWAY WE CAN -- THERE IS ALSO INTEREST IN THE SALE OF HEMP IN HEMP PRODUCTS AT A CERTIFIED FARMERS MARKETS AND THAT SOMETHING'S BEING -- INVESTIGATED FURTHER BAR INSPECTION SERVICES DIVISION. AND THEN THERE ARE CERTAINLY OTHER PROVISIONS IN THE FEED THEIR CULTURAL CODE THAT MAY HAVE POTENTIAL IMPACTS WITH REGARDS INDUSTRY HAPPENED SO WE'RE CONTINUING TO EVALUATE -- AND AS I MENTIONED WE FIND NEW AND INTERESTING SITUATIONS ALMOST EVERYDAY. I HAVE  QUESTION SO ARE THEIR LICENSEES THAT THAT CURRENTLY DO HAVE LICENSES TO SELL NURSERY STOCK. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY -- WITH THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S RELATIVELY NEW -- WITH THE THE CHANGES IN THE FEDERAL FARM BILL THE KIND OF OPENS THINGS UP A BIT MORE FOR DEFINING. AND AS AN AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY -- AND SO WE MADE IN THE PAST WE'VE WE CERTAINLY WE USED TO RECEIVE A LOT OF APPLICATIONS FOR CANNABIS GROWERS ESPECIALLY BACK BEFORE PROP -- SIXTY FOUR THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF WHAT OUR OUR NURSERIES ARE CURRENTLY GROWING I KNOW IF I'VE HEARD. PERSONALLY FROM -- SOME OF OUR EXISTING NURSERIES THAT ARE INTERESTED IN MOVING INTO INDUSTRIAL HEMP SO I ANTICIPATE THAT THERE WILL BE SOME BUT I DON'T KNOW IF WE CURRENTLY HAVE AND OKAY. THANK YOU [inaudible] SENATOR CAMPERO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR I I HAVE -- A QUESTION IN REGARDS TO THE FRAMEWORK THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- AND WE'RE REALLY WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GROW CAMPAIGN TO REALLY FOCUS ON IT BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS. DEFINED IT AS AN AGRICULTURE PRODUCT IS THAT. KIND OF THE BASE FROM WHICH WE THEN MOVE OFF OFF OF SO. CALIFORNIA HAS ITS OWN INDUSTRIAL HEMP CLOSER GROWERS ARE REQUIRED TO FOLLOW -- SO WE CERTAINLY ARE WORKING WITH -- COLLABORATING WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS TO TRY TO IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF FEDERAL LAW -- THAT ABSOLUTELY IMPACTS THE INTERSTATE MOVEMENT OF HELP -- AND SO AND THAT THAT IS SOMETHING WE'RE ACTIVELY WORKING ON HOWEVER WE'VE AS IMAGE WE HAVE HAD A WE'VE HAD AN INDUSTRIAL HEMP LAW IN PLACING IN CALIFORNIA FOR MANY YEARS NOW -- ZURICH ON ADMINISTERING OUR OWN OUR OWN LAW AND CERTAINLY WORKING WITH OUR COLLABORATES RY -- TO DO WHAT WE CAN. TO HARMONIZE AND COLLABORATE WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AND TRY TO APPLY A FEDERAL LAWS WELL AND MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNOW. OUR GROWERS ARE ARE PROTECTED IN AWARE OF THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT MAY BE APPLIED TO THEM. WELL I THAT THAT MAY ANSWER THE QUESTION I GUESS I'M. WE'RE SETTING UP THIS BIG FRAMEWORK THAT. THAT LOOKS LIKE IT MAY MAYOR WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH MARIJUANA BUT HIM TO REALLY. DIFFERENT PRODUCT AND AND SO I'M I JUST WANNA. I WANT TO CAUTION US -- EITHER IT'S AN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT. AND AND WE CAN SET UP -- SOME FRAMEWORKS THAT DON'T REQUIRE OVER REGULATION OR WEALTH OR ELSE WE'LL WE'LL SET UP THIS WHOLE FRAMEWORK WHERE YOU'VE GOT TO GET A LICENSE TO DO ANYTHING AND I JUST WORRY ABOUT THAT -- BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT HEMP IS DIFFERENT THAN MARIJUANA CERTAINLY IT'S GOT -- SOME REAL PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS THAT MAY ALLOW US -- TO USE IT IN WAYS THAT. WARRANT WARRANTY INITIALLY DESIGNED FOR HIM RIGHT WE IT IF IT USES LESS WATER HOW MUCH LESS WATER IF IT -- IF IT CLEANS THE SOIL -- IT MAY HAVE SOME APPLICATION FOR AGRICULTURE IN THAT REGARD AND IF IT CAN BE MANUFACTURED INTO PRODUCTS THAT ARE USEFUL AND THAT CAN REPLACE -- PLASTICS FOR EXAMPLE THERE MAY BE A HUGE MARKET FOR HEMP AND WE WOULD BE IN A IN A PRETTY UNIQUE POSITION IN THAT REGARD SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT BEFORE WE GO DOWN THIS ROAD WERE LICENSE ANY. LICENSING THE SEEDS LICENSING THE PLANT LICENSING. THE PROPERTIES THAT ARE GROWING AT THAT WE LOOK AT WHAT. A FRAMEWORK THAT GIVES US A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY THAN THAN MARIJUANA AND MARIJUANA. OBVIOUSLY IS A DIFFERENT IF IF IT'S A DIFFERENT SUBJECT AND WE WE NEED TO HAVE THAT LICENSING BUT BUT I'M I'M JUST NOT SURE IN IN THIS INSTANCE SO. JUST PUT THAT OUT THERE YEAH IF I COULD ADDRESS THAT -- THANK YOU FOR THAT FOR THE COMMENTS AND LIKE AND THE AND LAYING OUT SOME OF THE COMPLICATED STRUCTURES THAT WERE WORKING THROUGH -- CURRENTLY. HEMP IS IN FOOD ENACT CODE THEREFORE IT IS AN AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES INDUSTRY DID SUCH JUST LIKE THE REST OF THE FOUR HUNDRED COMMODITIES -- THAT ARE GROWN AS AGRICULTURAL YOU KNOW COMMODITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- AND WHAT. STATE LAW HAS CURRENTLY DIRECTED US TO DO IS TO SET UP A REGISTRATION PROGRAM FOR HIM -- WE DO NOT ISSUE A LICENSE AND REGISTRATION DOES TAKE PLACE -- AT THE LOCAL LEVEL DOWN WITH THAT COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS -- I THINK WHAT JOSH WAS REFERRING TO IN TERMS OF OF NURSERIES THEY DO HAVE TO GET CERTAIN LICENSES TO BE ABLE TO TO SELL PRODUCTS -- BUT IS CURRENTLY NOT THE INTENTION OF THE DEPARTMENTNOR WE STATUTORY REQUIRED TO DO ANY LICENSING -- FOR HIM CULTIVATORS AND DIFFERENT FROM CANNABIS NEW CANNABIS WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE AS AN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT YOU KNOW VERY DEFINED SEPARATE AND DIFFERENT AND THAT'S THAT'S HOW WE'VE BEEN APPROACHING IT FROM THAT KIND OF LANDS -- AND IN TERMS OF BEING A LAYING OUT THE FRAMEWORK CURRENTLY WE'RE NOT STATUTORILY DIRECTED TO TO ME -- WHAT CANNABIS IS DONE? AND SO COURT WE YOU KNOW WE PLAN TO STICK WITH THAT WITH THAT PASSED [inaudible] YEAH. BUT THAT'S ABOUT ALL THAT I'VE GOT SO -- THE LAST COUPLE SIDES HERE TO SIMPLY HAVE OUR CONTACT INFORMATION -- SO FOR THIS PROGRAM -- WE HAVE SET UP A GENERAL EMAIL INBOX TO TRY TO STREAMLINE AND SIMPLIFY THE ABILITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO GET A HOLD OF US. AND WE DO HAVE A WEBSITE -- WHICH HAS RECENTLY BEEN UPDATED TO HEAR THE REST TO SEE THE OF OUR LAW REGULATIONS -- AND AND THE VERY NEAR FUTURE IF IT'S NOT UP ALREADY WILL ALSO HAVE A COPY OF OUR APPLICATION -- AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL OUR REGION INFORMATION FOR CONSUMERS FOR GROWERS FOR ON THE COUNTIES AS WELL TO TRY -- TO I NAVIGATE THEIR WAY THROUGH THIS LAW -- SO WE ARE AGAIN OUR STAFF TO RECEIVE REGULAR QUESTIONS FROM THE PUBLIC AND I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE DO APPRECIATE THE ASSISTANCE WE GET NOT JUST FROM. THE REST OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS WITHIN OUR EIGHT OUR OWN AGENCY BUT ALSO FROM OTHER AGENCIES AS WELL -- TO TRY TO NAVIGATE SOME OF THESE OTHER ISSUES A DIVISION TWENTY FOR THE FUTURE CULTURAL CODE ADDRESSES CULTIVATION HOWEVER WE HAVE QUESTIONS ON ANYTHING INVOLVING HAVE NOT JUST ON THE CULTIVATION PRACTICES AND SO. WE DO APPRECIATE THE ASSISTANCE WE GET FROM FROM OUR PARTNERS ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE -- AND THAT'S ALL THAT I HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU TO BOTH OF YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS DO WE HAVE ANY FINAL QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. NOW OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HOPE YOU'LL JOIN US FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE HEARING. OUR SECOND PANEL IS DEALING WITH GROWER PERSPECTIVE ON INDUSTRIAL HEMP WE HAVE TAYLOR MOTION DIRECTOR OF COMMODITIES AND LAND USE FROM THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION.

I'M IN ANY OPPORTUNITY WE CAN OFFER -- TO ARE CALIFORNIA FARMERS TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO BE -- INNOVATIVE AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A NEW AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THAT OPPORTUNITY SO WE'D LIKE TO THANK SENATOR WILL FOR HIS BILLS WHILE. I'M AND I HAVE WITH ME DAY FOR BIRDIE HE AS A FOURTH THIRD GENERATION -- RANCHER AND OFF A GROWER I'M FROM PLUMAS SIERRA COUNTIES I'M AND SO I'M GONNA LET HIM LEAD AS THE AS THE GROWER EXPERT ON THE STAND HE THANK YOU MISTER BERNIE THANK YOU. THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE INTIMIDATING BE THE CORE EXPERT YEAH BUT THE YEAH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO COME TODAY AND AND DRESS YOU -- FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF OF A FARMER -- WHEN I MET UP WITH TAYLOR THIS MORE AND I SAID I DIDN'T ASK ABOUT DRESS CODE COULD I HAVE JUST WORN MY OLD DONALD COVERALLS OR WHAT AND HIS NO YOU'RE FINE BUT THE ANYWAY SO I'M A LITTLE OUT OF PLACE WITH MY JACKET ON BUT -- I AM. PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE THAT I SEE HIM BECOMING FOR CALIFORNIA FARMERS -- I AM OF THIS TAYLOR MENTION I AM A THIRD GENERATION FARMER I'M HERE TODAY WITH MY WIFE AND MY DAUGHTERS IN THE AUDIENCE -- AND SHE WRAPPED HER THAT REPRESENTS THAT FOURTH GENERATION -- THE WANTS TO STAY ON THE FORM. BUT AGRICULTURE IS PROBABLY MANY OF YOU KNOW IS GOES THROUGH SOME REAL CYCLES IN HARD TIMES AND PART OF THOSE TIMES ARE HITTING NOW FOR SOME -- SECTIONS OF AGRICULTURE. AND TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE ON FARMING -- CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE SOMETIMES IT'LL GET A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT OUR OWN PERSONAL SITUATION IN JUST A MOMENT. CURRENTLY WE HAVE THREE GENERATIONS WORKING ON OUR FAMILY FARM -- WE GROW ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED ACRES OF ALFALFA UNDER -- PIVOT IRRIGATION AND ALSO RUN ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED BEEF CATTLE ON OUR ON OUR OPERATION IN OUR OPERATION START NINETEEN TWENTY TWO WITH MY GRANDPARENTS. AND IT'S BEEN OUR FAMILY EVER SINCE AND IS COMPLETELY FAMILY OWNED AND OPERATED -- WE LIVE -- HANG IN A LITTLE BIT OF SOME WHAT DO A LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY CONSIDER BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY AND YET -- IN IT IS BUT IT'S SOME PRETTY HARSH COUNTRY TOO SO WERE UP IN THE IN THE SIERRAS JUST NORTH THE TRUCKEE CALIFORNIA ABOUT THIRTY FIVE MILES AN ELEVATION OF FIVE THOUSAND FOOT -- BEAUTIFUL VALLEY -- BUT IT CREATES ITS OWN CHALLENGES IN THAT -- BECAUSE OF OUR CLIMATE AND VERY SHORT GROWING SEASON AND CALL COLD SEASON AND SO WE CAN GET FROST ANY DAY OF THE YEAR. AND YES I'VE EVEN SEEN SNOW ON THE FOURTH OF JULY -- BELIEVE IT OR NOT -- LAST YEAR WE HAD MADE A DECISION OUR FAMILY -- TO REALLY TAKE A BIG JUMP OF FAITH AND OUT OF OUR COMFORT ZONE AND TO US. TRY PLANTING SOME HAMP -- THE MAIN REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE OF OUR DECISION MAKING WAS BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVE CROP -- IN OUR SITUATION GROWING OFF ALPHA. FOR MOST OF OUR MARKET GOES TO DERRY'S IN THE MODESTO TURLOCK AREA AND IN DERRY MARKET IS REALLY BEEN HURTING LAST SUMMER YEARS A LOT OF DAIRIES GOING OUT OF BUSINESS. pAFFECT OUR MARKET AT SOME POINT TWO AND WE DECIDED IT'S TIME TO START LOOKING FOR ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE. UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO OUR CLIMATE AVOCADOS DON'T WORK TOMATOES DON'T WORK ALMOST NOTHING CAN STAND THE COLD WEATHER THAT WE HAVE. AND THEN WE RAN ACROSS HIM. AND THAT LAST YEAR WE DID PLANT SOME. UNDER THE PROGRAM WITH THE UNIVERSITY IN ABOUT AT ARENA ON DR -- GLENN MILLER WHO WAS THEY WERE EXCITED ABOUT ONE APPROACHING ABOUT DOING RESEARCH FOR US. BECAUSE NORTHEASTERN CALIFORNIA NORTHWESTERN NEVADA. HAVE VERY SIMILAR CLIMATE AND DRY. LOW PRECIPITATION ON THE SIDE OF THIS YEAR AS AND AND KIND OF COLD COUNTRY AND SO HAVING -- BECAUSE WE'RE JUST FROM ABOUT FORTY MINUTES FROM RENO AND HE WAS EXCITED THAT HE COULD JUST HAVE A SHORT DRIVE TO COME DO THE RESEARCH -- WITH HIS -- WITH HIS STUDENTS -- SO WE LOOKED AT HIM LAST YEAR WE DID PLAN SOME AND I WOULD NOT CALL IT A SUCCESS AT ALL. WE HAVE A WE LEARNED A LOT THROUGH OUR FAILURES AND I THINK THAT'S GONNA TAKE PLACE THROUGHOUT -- WITH THE FARMERS BECAUSE IT IS A NEW CROP -- BUT THROUGH THAT LEARNING WE LEARNED THAT IT IS POSSIBLE IN OUR AREA -- THAT HIM HANDLE TEMPERATURES DOWN INTO THE MID TWENTIES. IT DIDN'T LIKE THE EIGHTEEN DEGREES FOR MORNINGS IN A ROW IN THE FIRST WEEK OF SEPTEMBER HAND SO THAT WE DECIDED IT'S TIME TO HARVEST. AND THE HEAD OF IT -- TO BUT IT DOES HANDLE THE COOLER WEATHER AND SO. I'M NOT CONVINCED YET THAT IT'S GOING TO WORK FOR US. BUT OF THE VERY VERY FEW CROPS THAT CAN GROW IN THERE I THINK THIS IS A REALLY HAS THE POTENTIAL. THE OTHER PART THAT REALLY EXCITES ME IS THE POTENTIAL OF WHAT THIS CROP CAN DO AND I'M NOT GONNA GET INTO ALL THE DETAILS OF CENTER HERE WAS TALKING ABOUT MAKING PLASTICS AND FIBER BOARDS AND EVERYTHING BUT IT REALLY IS ENDLESS I THINK ALMOST WITH THIS PLANT CAN DO. A LOT OF THE HYSTERIA AND HYPE AND EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW IS ALL BASED AROUND CBT OILS AND DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT AND I THINK THAT'S GREAT. BUT I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT MORE ESPECIALLY WHEN WE START GETTING TO THE PROCESSING OF THE FIBER AND THE USES THAT ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE PLACE THERE I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE REAL FUTURE IS GOING TO BE. OUR RESEARCH WITH THE UNIVERSITY IN ABOUT AT ARENAL. BILL WITH A FIVE AREAS LAST YEAR AND WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE OUR RESEARCH HOPEFULLY FOR IF IF THINGS GROW ALL RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THAT FOR FIVE YEARS -- THIS WILL WE DID NOT GET INTO THE THIS RESEARCH JUST TO GIVE US A LICENSE SO TO SPEAK TO TO GROW HAMP WE REALLY WANT TO DO THE RESEARCH AND SO WE'VE GOT A IVE YEAR AGREEMENT WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA RENO. THE BIGONE WE WERE TO COME IN THERE ALL BIG BUT THE WATER CONSUMPTION IS A BIG ONE ESPECIALLY FOR OUR AREA WE ARE IN A MOTOR ITS OWN AS FAR AS OUR OUR WATER BASIN HAD AND THE THE PROBLEMS YOU CAN HAVE THEIR WE BELIEVE THAT THE WATER. CONSUMPTION WILL BE PROBABLY ABOUT A THIRD OF WHAT ALFALFA YES -- INSECT PREDATION -- WE DON'T KNOW NEW WEEVILS CROSSOVER FROM ALFALFA -- TO HAMPER AND SO WERE WERE DIDN'T WERE STUDYING THAT. PLANT SPACING FOR OPTIMAL YIELD -- THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION HOW FAR APART YOU NEED TO PUT THE PLAN SIR TO THE YOU KNOW IF IF THEY NEED TO GET ROOM TO GROW OR DO THEY DO BETTER -- CLOSER TOGETHER. PLANT VARIETIES TO TO FIT OUR CLIMATE -- IT'S LIKE ANYTHING ELSE -- YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE RIGHT VARIETIES TO HANDLE THAT AND SO WE'RE LOOKING INTO THAT. AND THE OPTIMAL TIME TO HARVEST -- SO THAT REQUIRES TESTING. EVERY FOUR FIVE DAYS ONCE YOU GET TO MATURITY POINT SO WHAT IS THE OPTIMAL TIME TO HARVEST -- AND TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OF OF THE CROPS BEST DEAL. I THINK CAMPUS. HAS BECOME AN WILL BECOME THAT CROP THAT HELPS US. FIND THE VIABILITY FOR A LOT OF FARMERS NOT JUST IN OUR AREA AND THROUGHOUT NORTHEASTERN CALIFORNIA BUT ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THAT BY ABILITY TO STAY IN BUSINESS. AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE OF SO MANY SECTORS IN AGRICULTURE THAT ARE STRUGGLING. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A TOMATO -- TRANSPLANT COMPANY. AND TO SEE IF THEY CAN AND THEY THINK THEY CAN TO SEE IF THEY CAN MODIFY THEIR EQUIPMENT. TO PLANT SEEDS OF HIM TO START THEM PLANTS AND THEN ACTUALLY IT TRANSPLANT THEM JUST LIKE DOING TOMATOES -- THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES THERE THE SIZE OF THE PLANTS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT THAN A FEW DIFFERENT THINGS. BUT IN TALKING WITH THIS GENTLEMAN IS A VISITOR AT OUR PLACE -- LAST WEEK -- HE'S EXCITED ABOUT GETTING INTO THIS NEW VENTURE ALSO. BECAUSE WHAT'S TAKING PLACE IN AND TOMATO INDUSTRY THAT I DIDN'T KNOW IS THEIR SCALING BACK TO THEY'RE GOING THROUGH A HARD TIME HE LOST OVER A THOUSAND ACRES THAT -- THAT THEY PLANTED LAST YEAR AND SO HE'S REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO STRUCTURE HIS BUSINESS TO TO HELP US OUT TO KEEP HIS EMPLOYEES. AND TO KEEP HIS BUSINESS GROWING. THERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT -- AND CHALLENGES AHEAD BUT BEING A NEW CROP WE EXPECT THAT AND WE FOUND THAT OUT LAST YEAR -- WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO PLANT USING SEEDS ARE USING CLONES -- WE'D AN INSECT CONTROL IS GOING TO BE A BIG ONE BECAUSE THERE'S THERE'S NO REGISTER PESTICIDES OR HERBICIDES AVAILABLE ON HIM YET -- AS WELL AS WELL AS THE THE BEST WAY TO HARVEST THAT IS ONE OF THE REAL QUESTIONS THAT ARE STILL OUT THERE THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT IDEAS AND MODIFICATIONS TO EQUIPMENT BUT THERE IS NO ONE WAY YET -- OF TO HARVESTING IN FACT A LOT OF IT IS STILL DONE -- BY HAND AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR -- BUT THE FARMERS WILL FIGURE OUT A WAY. I'VE GOT NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT THEY'RE PRETTY. GOOD AT INVENTING THINGS AND MODIFYING THINGS -- PROCESSING PLANTS ARE LAGGING BEHIND A LITTLE BIT AND THAT'S EXPECTED BECAUSE I CAN EXPECT SOMEBODY GO BUILD A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR PROCESSING PLANT BEFORE THIS PRODUCT. AND SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A CATCH -- TWENTY TWO AND SO NOW THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A THE TIME LAG THERE TO GET THINGS PROCESS TO WHERE DO YOU GO WITH IT -- BUT I THINK OVER THE NEXT COUPLE THREE YEARS THAT WILL ALL GET EVENED OUT AND THE PROCESSORS WILL COME -- BUT WITH THE CHALLENGES ALSO COME. WITH A NEW CROP -- ALSO COMES OPPORTUNITY AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO BE LOOKING. FORWARD. AT WHAT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE -- FOR US THE OPPORTUNITY IS. HOPEFULLY PROVIDING A VIABLE WAY FOR OUR OPERATION TO STAY IN BUSINESS SO ARE FOR GENERATION FIFTH GENERATION WHATEVER FARMERS -- OR FAMILY CAN STAY ON THAT LAND -- BECAUSE YOU BEGIN TO WORRY ABOUT OKAY OF ALFALFA MARKET GOES AWAY. WHAT WE DO NOW BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS? TO SELDOM THAT A NEW CROP COMES ALONG. WITH THAT. CAN REALLY GET EXCITED ABOUT -- WHEN I WAS I WENT TO HIM CONFERENCE BACK IN DENVER A FEW WEEKS AGO? AND THIS GUEST SPEAKER THERE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING HE SAYS YOU KNOW THE LAST BIG CROP THIS COUNTRY IS REALLY SEEN THAT REALLY CHANGING THE SOYBEAN. AND I WAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. I THINK HIM AND HE THOUGHT SO TOO I THINK HIM HAS THE ABILITY TO BE WAR WAY BIGGER THAN SOLVING CROP -- WHAT WE CAN DO WITH IT -- SO ANYWAY I'VE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I'LL ANSWER ANY KIND OF QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE FOR ME AND IF -- WHEN WE GET INTO THE SEASON IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO COME TAKE A LITTLE TOUR WE'D LOVE TO HAVE INVITED TO COME SEE OUR PLACE SOME? THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DID HAVE A QUESTION -- IN TERMS OFTHE WEATHER WHEN IT'S WHEN WE HAVE LATE RAINS. AND YOUR CROP GETS WET AND THEN YOU HAVE THE SUN COMING AND IS THERE A CHANCE FOR MORE THAN WHAT DOES THAT DO TO YOUR CROP WHEN YOU HAVE LATE RAINS. YES -- MILDEW IS AB IT CAN BE A BIG PROBLEM FOR HIM -- AND PROBABLY OVERSTEPPED AMOUNT OVERSTEPPING MY BOUNDS OF KNOWLEDGE HERE BUT THE THERE THERE'S A CONCEPT THAT HAMS GONNA JUST GROW ANYWHERE -- AND I DON'T I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S GOING TO BE THE CASE -- HIM DOES NOT LIKE REALLY HOT WEATHER IT JUST KIND OF SHUTS DOWN DOESN'T GROW WE'RE WELL -- HIM DOESN'T LIKE HIGH HUMIDITY. SO THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS OF THE STATE THAT PROBABLY IS NOT GOING TO WORK REAL WELL TO BE GROWING HIM. BUT THE ONE THING YOU DO WANT TO TRY TO CONTROL IS THE HUMIDITY UNFORTUNATELY WE DO GET SOME RAINS AT THE WRONG TIME -- AND IT COULD CAUSE YOU SOME PROBLEMS THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. HARVESTING IS IS GOING TO BE THE REAL TRICK THERE SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS NOW THAT THEY'RE LOOKING A HARVESTING SOME OF THEM CUT THE HAMPER AND THEN LEAVE IT ON THE GROUND FOR FOUR FIVE DAYS TO DRY. AND THEN COME THROUGH WITH SOME EQUIPMENT -- TRY THIS -- SEPARATE THE LEAVES IN THE BUGS FROM THE STOCK AND STUFF. THAT PUTS YOU KNOW DANGER ZONE THOUGH AWHILE IT'S SITTING ON THE GROUND TRYING TO DRY -- THERE'S OTHER -- METHODS COMING ABOUT IT SEEMS LIKE THAT -- YOU CAN CUT IT -- AND MEDIA THE HOLLOW IN THE TELL PROCESSING WILD GREEN EVEN SO -- ALL THAT'S GOING TO COME WITH PEOPLE FIGURING OUT HOW TO DO A BIT YES MILDEW CAN BE A VERY BIG PROBLEM FOR FOR HIM YES. AND WHAT ABOUT IF YOU HAVE A AN EARLY FREEZE WHATEVER CROP FREEZES. WE DON'T KNOW THAT YET -- WHAT IT WHAT OF MY ENTERED WHAT I'VE STUDIES SO FAR IN RED IS HIM EVEN AS A IS A A SEEDLINGPLANT CAN HANDLE FROST PRETTY WELL -- WHATWE'RE GOING TO DO THIS YEAR BECAUSE WE CAN STILL GET FROST -- UP TO NOW THE END OF MAY AND INTO THE FIRST PART OF JUNE WORK FOR GONNA PLANTING ABOUT THE FIRST OF JUNE -- WE ARE GOING TO PLANT -- IN IN ROSE BASICALLY WITH PLASTIC DOWN -- AND THAT'LL HELP WITH SOME RADIANT HEAT FROM THE SOIL FOR THE CEILING PLANTS -- AND WE THINK THAT'S GOING TO HELP US A LITTLE BIT IN CASE WE DO HIT ARE REALLY COLD NIGHT -- BUT IN INTERVIEWS AND GRIPPER OCCASION AND SOUL THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN ALTER A LITTLE BIT TO HELP WITH THAT BUT YES FROST IS A REAL CONCERN FOR US -- ON THE ONE THING THAT. HAS BEEN A REAL STRUGGLE FOR US BECAUSE IT IT'S ALSO VERY -- HI INVESTMENT CROP RIGHT AT THIS POINT. VERY HIGH -- YEAH YOU CAN SPEND TWELVE FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AN ACRE VERY EASILY -- TO TO GET IT IN AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS IS REALLY CONCERNED -- SO WAS AND AS OF RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO CROP INSURANCE AVAILABLE -- FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR FROST FOR RAIN -- FOR HAIL -- AND SO IS THE MAKES CRINGE A LITTLE BIT -- MY WIFE -- SHE HAS BEEN HOUNDING SO A COUPLE DIFFERENT INSURANCE COMPANIES AND WE'VE FINALLY. FOUND THE ONE THAT WILL GIVE US A SOME. CROP INSURANCE IN THE SENSE OF A AND EVENT INSURANCE IF WE GET A MASSIVE HAIL STORM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT THEY WILL -- THEY WILL COVER IT SO THAT THE BETH THE ONLY INSURANCE COMPANY WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DIG UP SO THAT GIVES US A LITTLE BIT OF RELIEF. TO KNOW THAT OUR INVESTMENT IS PROTECTED TO SOME EXTENT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SENATOR WELKER WHY NOT -- WHAT WERE YOU GET YOUR SEATS FROM? THESE ARE COMING FROM -- TO DIFFERENT PLACES SOME SOME COMING OUT OF COLORADO THIS YEAR AND AND SOME OTHERS COMING OUT AND ABOUT IT WE'RE WE'RE GONNA PLAN FOR DIFFERENT WE'RE GONNA DO TWENTY ACRES IS ALREADY DOING THIS YEAR -- AND RENEW FOR DIFFERENT VARIETIES THERE -- THAT WE'VE BEEN WILL WORK FOR THE GENTLEMAN LAST YEAR AT OF FALLON NEVADA THAT THEY'VE BEEN GROWING FOR ABOUT THE LAST THREE YEARS OR FEELS JUST LOOK BEAUTIFUL -- AND HE HE'S KIND OF GUIDED ME IN THE DIRECTION OF VARIETY AS FAR AS THE THE MOST -- FROST RESISTANT AND AND HEARTY PLANT AND SO WE'RE WE'RE TRYING THREE OR FOUR FOUR DIFFERENT VARIETIES THERE TO TO SEE HOW THEY DO. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY AT THIS POINT YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT GROWS PASSED IN YOUR MICROCLIMATE BEFORE YOU CAN FIGURE AYE AND THEN YOU WERE GOING TO FIND PEOPLE TO BUY IT AFTER THAT RECORD RIGHT NOW YOU JUST KIND OF BETA TESTING RIGHT YES WE ARE BETA TESTING RIGHT. NOW SO. I WOULD LOVE TO AND IT'LL TAKE YEARS OF COURSE TO DEVELOP SEED -- AND THAT'S WAY BEYOND MY SKILL SET BUT I WOULD LOVE TO DEVELOP SEE THAT FITS OUR CLIMATE AREA YOU KNOW IF WE CAN FIND SOMETHING THAT CAN HANDLE FROST DOWN. TO FIFTEEN DEGREES BOY YOU CAN. IT ALL DAY LONG YOU KNOW -- ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN PART OF THE STATE -- BUT IS SO THAT THAT'S KIND OF A LONG RANGE GOAL RIGHT NOW IS ALL RIGHT LET'S SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW THAT CAN GROW -- THAT WE WON'T LOSE OUR INVESTMENT ON AND NOW AND AND HOPEFULLY START. TRANSITIONING FROM IN SOME ALFALFA WERE CERTAIN I AM PLANNING ON GOING ALL THE WAY OUT BUT TRANSITIONING TO SEE IF IT'LL WORK OUT WELL. I APPRECIATE YOUR VISION AND I SHARE IT AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE AN ENTREPRENEURIAL RISK -- I BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO PAY DIVIDENDS FOR YOU SOME VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. ANYBODY ELSE IN THIS ROOM IS INTERESTED WE ARE HAVING A CEREMONY AT ELEVEN AM IN MY DISTRICT IN THE NFL IN FRIDAY MAY SEVENTEENTH. WHERE WE ARE GOING TO BE DOING ARE FIRST PLANTING -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS FORBES MAGAZINE'S GOING TO BE THERE IN NEW YORK TIMES IS GOING TO BE THERE -- CAL EPA DIRECTOR CHAIRED BLUMENTHAL'S GONNA BE THERE NOW HAS TO COME WITH A NINE NOW STATE SO NOW HE'S LOCKED IN -- AND IF YOU'RE INTERESTED YEAH GET BACK TO ME AND I WILL MAKE SURE YOU GET AN INVITE TO TWO TANKS I THINK IS VERY MONUMENTAL AND YOU ARE ON THE VANGUARD SIR SO CONGRATS THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. THAT'S GREAT I DO HAVE A QUESTION SO IS INDUSTRIAL HIM AN ANNUAL OR PERENNIAL T'S AN ANNUAL IT IS AN AND IT IS AN ANNUAL YOU TO PLANT EVERY YEAR -- THEN AND I WANTED TO BUY YOUR TIMES YOU CAN TELL ME TO BE QUIET AT ANY POINT SELL -- TO GIVE YOU A THIS YEAR BECAUSE RIGHT NOW SEED IS. FOR NEXT YEAR TO SEAT IS PROBABLY THE PLACE TO BE. TO BE SELLING -- SEAT CAN RANGE TYPICAL MOST CEDARS RANGING ABOUT A DOLLAR TO TWO DOLLARS PER SEED -- ORIGINALLY WE WERE GOING TO TRY TO EASE PLANT -- CLONES THIS YEAR -- BECAUSE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE IS IS PLANTING CD END UP WITH SOME MALES AND MALES WILL END UP POLLINATING THE CROP AND REALLY REDUCING THE YEAR QUALITY OF THE CROP -- UNLESS YOU'RE TRYING TO RAISE FOR SEED -- SO WE'RE GONNA WITH CLONES THIS YEAR AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN CLONES WENT FROM FOUR FIVE DOLLARS PER PLANT. TO ABOUT EIGHT DOLLARS A PLAN AND A HOT THEY WERE PLAN ABOUT TWO THOUSAND PLANTS PER ACRE AND COLLECT ICAN'T DO THAT -- STILL -- BUT SEAT IS VIRTUALLY SOLD OUT AT THIS POINT -- AND AND I'M SURE WHEN CALIFORNIA SAYS THE GATES ARE OPEN THAT -- HEADS IT'S GOING TO BE SOLD OUT OF THE DAY -- WERE IF THEY CAN FIND ANY YES. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SENATOR CAPPIELLO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO YOU YOU I TESTIFIED THAT -- THAT HEMP IS A HIGH INVESTMENT CROP IS IS THAT -- BECAUSE OF THE SEA. YES MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE SEED COSTS -- BUT AND AND AND THE LABOR -- TO UNTIL MECHANICAL HARVESTING ESPECIALLY IS AVAILABLE -- LABOR COSTS ARE JUST. A HUGE BECAUSE A LOT OF IT IS DONE BY HAND RIGHT NOW. BUT I THINK OVER THE NEXT YEAR TOO THAT'S GOING TO START TO GET FIGURED OUT -- THERE'S THERE'S DIFFERENT METHODS COMING AROUND -- IT EVERYDAY I HEAR SOME GUY INVENTED SOMETHING ELSE THE THE TRY AND BUT BUT LABOR COSTS ARE VERY HIGH ALSO. AND THEN -- THOSE SEEDS. I'M I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT -- ABOUT HOW YOU PLANT THEM OR OR HOW THEY GROW -- ARE THEY HOT HOUSED IN THEN YOU PLANT THE PLANTS OR HOW HOW IS IT. YEAH HE SAID YOU CAN DO IT ANYWAY I MEAN I THINK FRANKLY IN THE SALINAS VALLEY WHICH IS WHERE I'M FROM -- THERE YOU THEY USED TO PLANT LETTUCE WITH SEATS AND NOW THOSE SEEDS DON'T. DON'T SHOW UP ANYWHERE YOU HOT HIGH HOUSING YOU BRING IT YOU BRING IN THAT SMALL PLANTS THERE PLANTED BY TRACTOR. THAT JUST AUTOMATICALLY PUT THEM IN THE GROUND IT'S AMAZING AND SO I'M WONDERING HOW WHAT THE APPLICATION IS IN TERMS OF HIM. MOST OF THE HAMPER NOW HE IS BEING TRANSPLANTED IN JUST LIKE YOU SAID WITH THE MECHANICAL MACHINES -- AND AND SO THEY STILL START TO SEEDS IN IN THE HOT HOUSES AND USUALLY THREE FOUR WEEKS OF GROWTH AND THEN THEY'LL START TRANSPLANTING -- BUT WE DID TRY LAST YEAR SOME DIRECT SEEDING INTO THE FIELD -- AND IT WORKED OKAY -- AND SO I THERE'S SOME TECHNOLOGY COMING THAT'S JUST INCREDIBLE TO WHERE THEY'RE TAKING TISSUE SAMPLES -- CULTURES I'M SORRY -- FROM PLANTS -- TO WORDS. AND AND IT'S JUST MICROSCOPIC ALMOST AND THEY CAN CAPITALIZE THEM AND THEN USE THAT AS YOUR SEED AND SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO GROW THOSE IN A HOT HOUSE AND YOU CAN PLAN OF DIRECT BUT AS OF RIGHT NOW MOST OF THE CAMPUS BEING PLANTED. AS AS STARTER PLANTS AND THEN BEING TRANSPLANTED. SO IN THEORETICALLY -- AT SOME POINT IF YOUR OPERATION IS IS BIG ENOUGH YOU COULD ACTUALLY REPRODUCE YOUR OWN PLANTS. AND AND YOU COULD -- ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS GONNA COME IS -- IF I'M TRYING TO GROW FOR EXAMPLE IF I'M TRYING TO GROW FOR CBD OIL. I WANT ALL FEMALE PLANTS I DON'T WANNA POLLINATE ANY PLACE I DON'T WANT SEATS ON A WINNING WALL OF MY NEIGHBOR SAYS I WANNA GO FOR SEED. ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S CROSS CONTAMINATION THERE THAT POLLINATION IS GONNA AFFECT ME. AND SAYS GIVE ME SOME REAL CHALLENGES I THINK TO BE WORKED OUT THROUGH SOME REGULATION -- MAYBE CRANE SOME SOME ZONES THAT ARE YOU KNOW GIVEN SOME DISTANCE -- TO PROTECT THOSE GUYS BUT IS SO pIT JUST DEPENDS WHAT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING TO GROW -- BUT IT DID THERE'S GOING TO BE SO THEY CAN BE CHALLENGES WE'VE WE ALL KNOW THAT -- THERE'S GONNA BE SOME THAT WHEN YOU'RE STARTING TO TALK ABOUT A BRAND NEW CROP HERE AND TRYING TO YOUR COMMENTS EARLIER ABOUT THE REGULATIONS -- YEAH -- AS A FARMER I DON'T WANT ANYMORE REGULATIONS AND ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO HAVE AND YET THERE'S GONNA NEED TO BE SOME TO BE ABLE. TO THE GUIDE FARMERS AND AND GROWERS IN THE DIRECTION THAT THE TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS IN A IN A PROPER WAY -- SO -- IT BUT YEAH THERE'S GONNA BE SOME SOME BUMPS. YEAH WELL I APPRECIATE THAT I I'VE MIKE MY MY A INTENSE INTEREST IS THAT. AS AS YOU SAID IT'S A NEW CROP -- BUT I AM. IT IT'S NOT CLEAR. TODAY AS WE SIT HERE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH SIGMA. AND WE HAVE. LOT AGRICULTURE THIS GOING TO BE IMPACTED -- AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE GOOD AND A GOOD IMPACT SO THE MORE THAT WE CAN FIND ALTERNATIVE. CROPS AND THE ABILITY I'VE BEEN TOLD --AND I'VE TALKED TO SCIENTISTS FROM EUROPE THAT HAVE BEEN GROWING HIM FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. THAT -- HIM HAS THE ABILITY TO CLEAN THE SOIL. AND WHAT THAT MEANS BECOMES REALLY IMPORTANT WHAT'S THE SCIENCE BEHIND IT AND HOW CAN WE USE IT AND AND AND YET CONTINUE. TO CONTINUE TO FARM YES SO THAT THAT'S I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY AND AND YOUR FORWARD THINKING THIS IN THE RISK THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY HAVE TAKEN BECAUSE IT'S NOT EASY TO MOVE INTO SOMETHING THAT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT BUT I THINK YOU ARE ON THE FOREFRONT OF SOMETHING. AND I'M I'M EXCITED ABOUT IT BECAUSE I GO DOWN TO THAT THE HEALTH FOOD STORE AND I BOUGHT HIM SEE BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE MORE IT'S A HIGHEST SOURCE OF PROTEIN. AND IT COSTS A FORTUNE I MEAN YOU COULDN'T LIVE ON HEMP SEEDS BY THEMSELVES. B. B. PRETTY SKINNY BUT BUT IT IT IT IT'S INTERESTING TO ME BECAUSE NOT ONLY IT IS IS IT A COMMODITY YOU CAN EAT THAT HAS BENEFICIAL HEALTH VALUE BUT IT ALSO -- HAS THESE -- APPLICATIONS THAT ARE JUST SO DIVERSE THAT IT IT IT'S INTERESTING AND I WANT I WANT TO SEE CALIFORNIA BE ON THE FOREFRONT I WANT TO SEE AS NORMALIZE IT AS A CROP. I GUESS IS THE WAY THAT I I SEE IT AND I DO APPRECIATE THERE PROBABLY IS GOING TO NEED TO BE REGULATION GIVEN THAT YOU CAN. YOU CAN CROSS POLLINATED YOU DON'T WANT TO BE AFFECTING. ARE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IMPACTING YOUR NEIGHBOR IN A NEGATIVE WAY AND SO I I APPRECIATE THAT AND WE DO IT WE DO IT WITH THEM. WITH CERTIFIED ORGANICS ANYWAY SO I'M I'M SURE WE CAN WE CAN GET TO A PLACE THAT EVERYBODY FEELS IS A COMFORTABLE PLACE THERE WILL BE AWAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THAT IF WE HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. AND OUR THIRD PANEL. DEALING WITH ADVOCACY FOR GROWING INDUSTRIAL HIM WE HAVE EIGHTY BERNACCHI DIRECTOR AND LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE. FOR THE CALIFORNIA HIM COUNCIL AS WELL AS PATRICK GROGAN GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE CALIFORNIA HIM COUNCIL [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ANYONE I CAN MAP THE CALIFORNIA HAVE COUNSEL -- THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL IS A COALITION OF HEMP -- CULTIVATORS MANUFACTURERS AND PRODUCT PRODUCERS -- WHO HAVE COME TOGETHER TO CREATE A COUNCIL TO PROMOTE AND PROTECT THE HEALTH INDUSTRY FROM THE LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY PERSPECTIVE? AND SO IT'S VERY EXCITING THAT THE INDUSTRY IS TRYING TO FORMULATE -- IN A LARGER WAY TO PROTECT ITSELF AND PROMOTE ITSELF IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- ONE START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING THIS HEARING TODAY -- IT'S VERY REFRESHING TO SEE SUCH INTEREST. AND INDUSTRIAL HEMP AND HOW WE CAN PROMOTE IT HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- YOU MANY OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HERE AT AND CRITICALLY INVOLVED. IN -- CITY CALIFORNIA POSITION ITSELF TO BENEFIT FROM THE HEMP INDUSTRY SO -- I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU AND START OFF WITH THAT -- HIPPA THE BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY -- IS ANTICIPATED TO DOUBLE. AND BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR. AND COMPARED TO SOME OF OUR NEIGHBORING STATES LIKE OREGON -- COLORADO MONTANA CALIFORNIA HAS FALLEN BEHIND THE CURVE IN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS THE INDUSTRY WILL PROVIDE FROM AN AGRICULTURAL STANDPOINT. ACCORDING TO THE US DEPARTMENT AGRICULTURE AT LAST YEAR OREGON PRODUCED. SEVENTY EIGHT HUNDRED ACRES OF HEMP -- COLORADO PRODUCED. TWENTY ONE THOUSAND ACRES OF HAPPY IN MONTANA PRODUCE TWENTY TWO THOUSAND ACRES OF LAND FOR HIM FOR COMMERCIAL USE. CALIFORNIA'S OFFICIALLY PRODUCED -- ZERO ALTHOUGH WE ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT HUNDRED ACRES OF HAVE WAS GROWN IN CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BY ESTABLISH AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS -- BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO -- IN AHEAD OF US TO GET CALIFORNIA -- WHERE IT SHOULD BE -- IT'S RIGHTFUL PLACE AS THE AGRICULTURAL CAPITAL OF THIS COUNTRY -- THE NEED TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA STATUTES ARE UP TO DATE COMPATIBLE WITH FEDERAL LAW IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE -- CENTER WILK A IS VERY AWARE OF THIS IS HE'S BEEN THE AUTHOR OF THE MOST RECENT EFFORTS -- IN THIS AREA -- THIS EAR -- WERE SPONSORING -- WITH THEIR WORK AS THE AUTHOR SB ONE FIVE THREE I BELIEVE THE CHAIR IN CENTER CABALLERO BOTH CO AUTHORS OF THAT MEASURE -- YOU KNOW WITH AND THAT BILL WILL UPDATE CALIFORNIA'S LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK SO THE GOLDEN STATE CAN APPLY -- FOR IMPROVE STATE PLAN UNDER THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FARM BILL -- AND GET HAVE CULTIVATION GOING HERE IN THE STATE ON A LARGE SCALE -- TO THAT I HAVE WITH ME. TODAY MISTER PATRICK GARGAN GOGGIN HE'S A CHIEF LEGAL COUNSEL TO THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL -- TO PROVIDE A QUICK OVERVIEW OF WHAT WILL TAKE TO GET LEGISLATIVELY -- DO YOU GET CALIFORNIA'S FEDERAL YOU KNOW FEDERAL PLAN OUR STATE PLAN UP TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND APPROVED AND UPDATE OUR STRUCTURE -- AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AN ALTERNATIVE PATRICK TO KIND OF GUIDE YOU THROUGH THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LOG IN. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO SAY. AT THE OUTSET THAT TODAY'S MONUMENTAL. WE'VE BEEN WHAT IT IS THE C. H. C. THE CALIFORNIA HIM COUNCIL CONTINUES THE GOOD WORK OF VOTE HAND THAT VOTE HEMP HAS BEEN LEADING. HAS LED US SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE WITH THE AND ASSEMBLY pSENATOR LANA -- AND IT'S ALSO MONUMENTAL BECAUSE WE WE ARE ON THE CUSP OF REGISTRATIONS BEING AVAILABLE AND I WANNA I WANNA. IN AND COMPLEMENT THE GOOD WORK OF CDFA AND IT'S IT'S RESILIENCE IN THE FACE OF A LOT OF CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING TO OVERCOME FOR AFTER EIGHTY YEARS OF PROHIBITING. AN AGRICULTURAL CROP IS IS IT THAT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE WE'VE WE'VE STIGMATIZED THAT WE'VE PUT IT IN THE CAMP OF A DRUG AND NOW WE CAN SAY IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT. STORY IS OVER AND WE'RE TRANSITIONING TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IS A TRANSITION EVERY YEAR WHERE BY THE BY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE FULL COMMERCIAL SCALE CAMPING GROWN IN THIS COUNTRY. FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE FIFTIES AND THAT IS MONEY NOW SO ON I'M GONNA GO THROUGH REALLY BRIEFLY A FEW OF THE THINGS THAT TO THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FARM BILL DOES WITHIN ITS HEMP PRODUCTION SECTION AND THEN WHAT WHAT IS CALIFORNIA DOING -- IN ANTICIPATION OF THAT ON IT TO GET ITS PROGRAM -- FURTHER -- AND STATUTES AND REGULATIONS FURTHER DEVELOPED TO CONFORM WITH THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FARM BILL SO JUST TO TO REPEAT A COUPLE THINGS HEY. THE US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURAL APPROPRIATELY NOW HAS JURISDICTION THE JURISDICTION OF THE D. E. A. HAS GONE AWAY I AM I I AM JUST TRULY HAPPY TODAY THAT THAT I'M NOT BEING CHASED AROUND THE CAPITAL BY JOHN LEVEL. WELL AS I DO. BOND IT'S IT'S IT'S A NEW DAY. SO USDA HAS BEEN TASKED WITH PROMULGATING REGULATIONS THERE IN THE MIDST OF THE DAY THEY HAD AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING THEMSELVES -- A MONTH OR SO AGO AND THEY THINK THAT LATER THIS YEAR HOPEFULLY BY THE END OF THE YEAR HOPEFULLY MAYBE THIS SOMETIME IN THE FALL THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE REGULATIONS -- ISSUED BY THE U. S. T. A. THAT WILL ENABLE THEM TO APPROVE STATE PLANS AND TO CREATE A PLAN FOR STATES THAT DON'T SUBMIT STATE PLANS. AND SIGNIFICANTLY THERE ARE SEVEN MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS THAT THE STATE BILL NEEDS TO MEET. NUMBER ONE I'LL JUST GO THROUGH KIND OF QUICKLY WHAT THOSE ARE NUMBER ONE IT'S IT'S A PRACTICE TO TRACK WHERE HELP IS BEING CROWNED AND THAT'S THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT -- THING THAT HAS THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED IN OUR STATUTE THROUGH REGISTRATION NOT pLICENSING -- REQUIREMENTS -- FOR FOR THINGS LIKE -- THE THE NURSERIES AND AND WHAT NOT BUT IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT THIS BE REGISTRATION PROGRAM NOT A LICENSE PROGRAM TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM. FROM CANNABIS -- SECOND THERE'S A THERE'S NEEDS TO BE PROCEDURES FOR TESTING OF CROPS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY COMPLY WITH THE T. C. LIMITATIONS AT POINT 3% AND AS PART OF THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A CONSIDERATION. FOR POST DECARBOXYLATION OR SIMILARLY RELIABLE METHODS WHICH WHICH ESSENTIALLY MEANS THAT TCA THE ACIDIC VERSION OF T. C. NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AND THERE'S AND THERE'S A AN EQUATION FOR THAT. THIRD THERE NEEDS TO BE A PROCESS FOR DISPOSING OF NON COMPLIANT CROPS PLANTS AND PRODUCTS. NUMBER FOUR THERE NEEDS TO BE A PROCEDURE FOR COMPLYING WITH. CERTAIN IT ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES THAT ARE LAID OUT IN THE FARM BILL. FOR VIOLATING THE PROGRAM. AND SOMETHING THAT WE WE WORKED HARD AGAINST IT BUT ULTIMATELY IT IT WAS A COMPROMISE THAT WAS ADOPTED AND AND THE THIRD IS A LIMITATION. ON FOLKS WHO'VE BEEN CONVICTED OF A FELONY. FOR THE PRIOR TEN YEARS THAT THEY CAN NOT THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE. NUMBER FIVE IS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE ANNUAL INSPECTIONS AND RANDOM SAMPLING PERFORMED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD IN AG. NUMBER SIX THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A TIMELY SUBMITTAL TO THE U. S. T. A.. BUY THE CD F. A. OF EACH PERMITS LOCATION AND STATUS. WHETHER IT'S ACTIVE OR INACTIVE IT'S BEEN. REVOKED WHAT HAVE YOU AND FINALLY THE STATE NEEDS TO CERTIFY. THAT IT HAS THE RESOURCES AND CAPABILITY TO CARRY OUT THE PROGRAM. ALSO INCLUDED WITHIN -- THE THE STATUTE. JUST A COUPLE OF POINTS IT DOES AUTHORIZED CROP INSURANCE -- AND THE THE GRANTING OF USDA GRANTS. THERE THERE. THERE WAS SOME CONCERN AND IS SOME CONCERN ON THE CROP INSURANCE BY. FOLKS LIKE THE CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROPER STANDARDS ARE ADOPTED SO THAT THE INSURANCE CARRIERS ARE NOT EXPLOITING OUR FARMERS. AND THAT'S BEING WORKED THERE AS A ALL THESE ISSUES IS ARE ARE ARE BEING WORKED THROUGH AND AND SIGNIFICANTLY AND IMPORTANTLY IN WAS WAS A TO RELATED. REFERRED TO EARLIER IS THAT THE THAT THE BILL [inaudible] PROHIBITS STATES. FROM. STOPPING. THE TRANSPORTATION OF TEN THROUGH THEIR STATES THEY CAN PROHIBIT THE PRODUCTION BUT THEY CANNOT STOP THE TRANSPORTATION OF HIM THROUGH THEIR STATES THAT'S THAT'S TRULY IMPORTANT THAT'S BECOME A GROUP OF A SIGNIFICANT -- AND PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGE. SINCE THE 200-020-0014 FARM BILL WHICH AUTHORIZES COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY IT'S IT'S LIMITED TO NEEDS TO BE TIED TO RESEARCH BUT HIS CREATED. THESE THESE THIS PATCHWORK QUILT OF STATE LAWS THROUGHOUT THE THE NATION HAVE CREATED A CHALLENGE PRODUCT AROUND AND AND THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE NEED. TO WE HONOR AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE THAT THE GOVERNMENT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS CREATING A PATHWAY THROUGHOUT THE NATION FOR CALIFORNIA. SO UNTIL THE STATE PLANS ARE APPROVED WE STAY AND WE ARE REMAIN UNDER THE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FARM BILL AS WE TRANSITION TO THE FULL COMMERCIAL SCALE WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE MEANTIME IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO GET REGULATIONS IN PLACE SO THAT THIS PILOT PROGRAM CAN. PROCEED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND GET US TO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE WE GET BEYOND THE PILOT PROGRAM SO. SB ONE FIVE THREE THAT EVERYBODY'S FAMILIAR WITH IS A LARGELY TECHNICAL BUILD WORKING TO CONFORM TO THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FARM BUILT AND MEET THESE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS HAND. THAT AT SOME POINT -- I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'RE AT WITH THIS BUT WE NEED TO ALSO HAVE A TRIGGER AND AND A MECHANISM FOR GETTING THE HELP FROM THE FARM. TO THE PROCESSING FACILITY THROUGH HANDLERS AND AND BROKERS AND THIS WILL BE A VEHICLE FOR THAT THE OTHER PIECE OF LEGISLATION -- THAT'S WORKING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE IS AB TWO TWO EIGHT AND THAT THAT IS PRINCIPALLY WORKING TO BOTH DECLARE. HAND EXTRACTED OILS FROM THE FLOWERS NOT TO BE AN ADULTERANT THAT'S BEEN A BIG. CONCERNED AND ISSUE RAISED BY THE FDA AND WE'RE HERE TO SAY AND WE'VE BEEN HERE TO SAY THAT HAD THAT THESE PRODUCTS ARE SAFE THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION HAS SAID THAT THEY'RE SAFE. IT'S A MATTER OF HOW THEY ARE. PROP PRODUCED AND THAT THEY NEED TO BE DONE IN A WAY THAT'S THAT THAT THE EMPLOYEES GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES AND THE SAME TYPE OF THING THAT AND AND END PROCESS SEES THAT ALL FOOD MANUFACTURERS ARE. HELD TO ACCOUNT FOR AND LET'S LET'S JUST LET'S JUST SAY. THIS IS A VEGETABLE AND WE NEED TO BE TO BE DEALING WITH THE AS A VESSEL REGULATING IT AS A VEGETABLE AS A FOOD. AND AS A DIETARY SUPPLEMENT AS A COP AS A TOPICAL AND THE COSMETIC NOT AS A DRUG IF SOMEONE WANTS TO GET INTO THE THE PHARMACEUTICAL APPLICATION OF THIS THEN THEY CAN WORK WITH THE FDA TO DO THAT. WE AS AN INDUSTRY ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE FDA TO TO MOVE BE ON TO ITS ITS POSITION ON CBT DERIVED FROM CANNABIS AND THEY ARE WORKING WITH THE INDUSTRY AND CONGRESS TO CREATE. OUR ALTERNATIVE PATHWAYS RECOGNIZE ALTERNATIVE PATHWAYS FOR THESE PRODUCTS IN THE NUTRACEUTICAL SPACE. BUT SIGNIFICANTLY WHAT AB TWO TWO EIGHT WILL DO IS GIVE CITY P. H. THE AUTHORITY IT NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR PRODUCTS ARE SAFE FOR OUR CONSUMERS. SO WITH THAT ALL LEAVE IT TO ANY ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE -- BUT AGAIN WE GREATLY APPRECIATE. THIS VENUE TODAY. TO PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION ON HOW PROGRESS AND IN THE STATE IN THE NATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY I APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONYVERY MUCH. AND DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE AUDIENCE OR ANY COMMENTS. OKAY WITH THAT WE HAVE. WE HAVE NO MORE BUSINESS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY. WE WILL [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] OKAY.
