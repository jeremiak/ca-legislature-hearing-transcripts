ON YOUR WAY UP- WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A AB EIGHT NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE ALLEN MISTER VOEPEL WILL BE DOING THE PRESENTATION WELCOME MR VOEPEL. SACRAMENTO I. FEEL LIKE A PILOT WITH ITS AUCTION MASCO NEW. SO AB NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE SIMPLY ASKS FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TO CONDUCT A STUDY TO ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE WHY FEMALE VETERANS COMMIT SUICIDE AT SUCH AN EXPONENTIALLY HIGH RATE COMPARED TO THEIR MALE COLLEAGUES THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR FEET VETERANS. ONCE THEY GET OUT OF THE MILITARY MORE WOMEN ARE SERVING IN THE UNITED STATES MILITARY. TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. TO HAVE A 15% INCREASE TO- TO WEAR OVER 20% OF MILITARY MEMBERS ARE WOMEN. WOMEN ARE ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING VETERANS GROUPS. NOW HERE'S SOME STATISTICS THAT WE NEED TO BEAR OUT. AND THIS IS MORE THAN JUST GUESS WORK. WOMEN VETERANS ARE AT A HIGHER RISK OF COMMITTING SUICIDE COMPARED TO NON VETERAN WOMEN OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS WOMEN NON VETERAN WOMEN SUICIDE RATE IS GOING UP WOMEN IT'S GONE UP TWO HUNDRED AND 50% NOW WE CAN ONLY GUESS WHY. I BELIEVE THIS IS JUST A PERSONAL OPINION HAVING SPENT NINE YEARS IN THE MILITARY SEXUAL HARASSMENT OUT NOT RAPE DENIAL BY A COMMAND FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT MANY TIMES IN THE MILITARY AND. ASSEMBLYMAN MATHIS WILL BEAR THIS OUT MANY TIMES IN THE MILITARY YOU HAVE TO WORK FOR SOMEONE THAT HATES YOU. THEN YOU HAVE NO CHOICE. AND MANY WOMEN REACT TO THAT ALL OF THEM DIFFERENTLY EVERYONE'S AN INDIVIDUAL ON THAT ONE. BUT I WOULD GUESS FOR WOMEN THAT'S INCREDIBLY DRAMATIC- IT'S THIS WOMEN IN THE MILITARY HAVE A MUCH TOUGHER THAN MANY PEOPLE AND I'M NOT JUST- PICKIN ON MEN MANY MEN FAIL IN THE MILITARY AND HAVE TO BE JUST CHARGE WITH THE GENERAL DOES CHARGE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T HACK IT SO THAT PART OF SUICIDE. WE NEED TO DISCUSS AND PREVENT. MILITARY VETERAN SUICIDE IS VITALLY NEEDED- WE'RE SIMPLY ASKING FOR A STUDY TO BE DONE. IN THIS STUDY CAN BE THE BEGINNING OF WHAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN DO IN ORDER TO GIVE BACK TO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SELFLESSLY PUT THEIR LIVES IN DANGER THROUGH THEIR SERVICE TO OUR NATION. THE FEDERAL VA HAS CONDUCTED VERY LIMITED STUDIES- IN MY OPINION ONCE AGAIN THIS IS A PERSONAL OPINION THE VA PRETTY MUCH FAILS THAT QUITE A BIT OF VETERANS HEALTH CARE AND FOR WOMEN. THEY THEY ARE HORRIBLE THEY THEY JUST DON'T PERFORM AND I'VE ALWAYS HAD A BITTERNESS THAT GETS TO BE A THEIR- IN OUR OWN CALIFORNIA VETERANS RESOURCE BOOK. PAGE NINETY EIGHT THERE'S THREE AND A HALF PAGES ON SUICIDE NOT A MENTION OF WOMEN NOT TO MENTION THAT IS SIMPLY KEEP IT GENERIC VETERANS SO. THE END OF THIS STUDY IT WOULD BE NICE TO GET A HALF A PAGE. DETAIL A KNOCKOUT WOMEN VETERANS SUICIDE. MADAM CHAIR A COLLEAGUES. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE.
