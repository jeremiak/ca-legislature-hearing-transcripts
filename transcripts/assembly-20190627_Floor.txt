EURO CENTRIC STANDARDS OF BEAUTY HAVE LONG HELD THE UNDERPINNINGS OF AMERICAN CULTURE SINCE THE FOUNDING OF OUR SOCIETY. DETERMINING WHAT WAS ACCEPTABLE AND ATTRACTIVE IN THE MEDIA IN ACADEMIC SETTINGS AND THAT WORK. FOR CENTURIES BLACK MEN AND WOMEN DID NOT OFTEN CHALLENGE THE STANDARDS WE STRAIGHTENED ARE HERE WITH HEAT OR CHEMICAL RELAXERS TO MEET THESE EURO CENTRIC STANDARDS. UNTIL TWENTY SIXTEEN A GOOGLE SEARCH. FOR UNPROFESSIONAL HAIRSTYLES YIELDED ONLY PICTURES OF BLACK WOMEN WITH NATURAL HAIR OR WEAVING BRAIDS OR TWISTS. ALTHOUGH DISHEARTENING THIS FACT IS NOT VERY SURPRISING. AND SO MEMBERS THE PURPOSE OF THIS MEASURE IS TWO FOLD. FIRST THERE IS A GREAT NEED TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE UNIQUE QUALITIES OF BLACK HAIR TEXTURES AND HOW THEY RELATE. TO NATURAL HAIR STYLES AND THE EXPERIENCES OF BLACK PEOPLE. SECONDS IT IS TIME TO CHALLENGE THOSE COMMONLY HELD MYTHS AND MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT WHAT DETERMINES PROFESSIONAL HAIR IN THE WORKPLACE IN SCHOOLS IN THE MEDIA AND EVEN IN THE MILITARY. FOR YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN TOO MANY CASES OF BLACK EMPLOYEES AN APPLICANT'S DENIED EMPLOYMENT OR PROMOTION. AND EVEN TERMINATED BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY CHOOSE TO WEAR THEIR HAIR. SO WEARING MY HAIR AND TWISTS OR LOCKS OR EVEN BRAIDS AND THESE ARE COURTESY OF PRASHANTH. SHOULD ALSO BE MINE PROTECTED RIGHT TO CHOOSE.

SIR GLORIA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED OPEN ON THISRESOLUTION. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER -- MEMBERS I RISE THIS MORNING ON BEHALF OF THE API LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS TO RESENT AG ARE NINETEEN WHICH CALLS UPON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO RESETTLE ALL THIRTY THOUSAND REFUGEES. THE UNITED STATES IS COMMITTED TO RESETTLE IN FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY NINETEEN CALIFORNIA HAS LONG BEEN HOME. A WELCOMING HOME FOR REFUGEES RESETTLED INTO OUR COMMUNITIES REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT THE REQUIRES THAT FEDERAL STATE COUNTY AND LOCAL AND NONPROFIT ENTITIES ALL TO WORK TOGETHER. AND SO IT'S OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE THAT EVERYONE COMES TOGETHER AS A UNITED FRONT. TO RESETTLE THESE FOLKS WHO NEED A HOME. HOWEVER THIS IS NOT BEEN THE CASE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR SOME YEARS THE CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION HAS DRASTICALLY CUT THE NATION'S REFUGEE ARRIVALS AND EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATED. ALMOST HALF OF ALL REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT SPOTS AVAILABLE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. THE UNITED STATES IS WELCOME FEWER THAN ELEVEN THOUSAND REFUGEES SO FAR THIS YEAR. WHERE NEARLY HALF WAY THROUGH THIS YEAR? AT THIS RATE THE ADMINISTRATION WILL COME NOWHERE NEAR THE RESETTLING TO THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE GOAL THAT HAD HAD THEY HAD BEEN SET. A GOAL WHICH PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE HISTORIC AVERAGE COMMITMENT OF NINETY FIVE THOUSAND REFUGEES ANNUALLY. CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO CONTINUE TO STAND. IN SUPPORT OF THIS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE POPULATION AS WE HAVE HISTORICALLY DONE IN THE PAST MEMBERS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AJ ARE. NINETEEN THANK YOU MISTER GLORIA MISS BARKIN YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF AJ ARE. NINETEEN I'D LIKE TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO FOR BRINGING FORWARD THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. THE JEWISH COMMUNITY KNOWS ALL TOO WELL WHAT IT IS LIKE TO SEEK REFUGE. IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES MY FAMILY CAME HERE. FLEEING THE HOLOCAUST SEEKING REFUGE ON OUR SHORES. AND THEY WERE GIVEN THAT REFUGE AND I'M STANDING HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF IT. SO MANY THAT WEREN'T GIVEN SAFETY ON THE SHORES WERE TURNED BACK AND PERSECUTED IN THE HOLOCAUST. SO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WORK THAT WE DO IS OF CLEAR CLEAR AWARENESS TO THE JEWISH CAUCUS. AS THE PRESIDENT OF HIGHEST HE SAID WE USED TO HELP REFUGEES BECAUSE THEY WERE JEWISH. BUT NOW WE HELP REFUGEES BECAUSE WE ARE JEWISH. FOR YEARS THE HEBREW IMMIGRANT AID SOCIETY HAS STOOD FOR A WORLD IN WHICH REFUGEES FIND WELCOME. SAFETY AND FREEDOM. IN FACT HI THIS WAS THE ORGANIZATION THAT FED MY FAMILY MEALS IN NEW YORK WHEN THEY ARRIVED. JEWISH TRADITION HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF JUSTIN EQUAL TREATMENT FOR THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE SUCH AS OUR REFUGEES AND IMMIGRANTS. THE TORAH TEACHES US THAT WHEN A STRANGER RESIDES WITH YOU IN YOUR LAND. YOU SHALL NOT DO THEM WRONG. THE STRANGER WHO RESIDES WITH YOU SHALL BE TO YOU AS ONE OF YOUR CITIZENS. YOU SHALL LOVE THEM AS YOURSELF FOR YOU WERE STRANGERS IN THE LAND OF EGYPT. WE CANNOT TURN OUR BACKS ON THOSE WHO NEED OUR HELP. AND SO AS A JEWISH CAUCUS WE STAND IN SUPPORT OF REFUGEES AND OF THIS RESOLUTION. I THINK THE AUTHOR AGAIN FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER BAUER K. ON MRS CARILLO. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I AM PROUD TO RISE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LATINO LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF HR. NINETEEN A RESOLUTION THAT EXPRESSES SUPPORT IN WELCOMING UP FOR ALL REFUGEES. COMING TO OUR STATE. THE DECISION TO LEAVE ONE'S HOME COUNTRY IS NEVER AN EASY DECISION. OFTEN PEOPLE ARE FAMILIES ARE LEAVING THEIR LOVED ONES FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS AND THEIR WAY OF LIFE. REFUGEES HAVE MADE THE INCREDIBLY HARD DECISION TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES IN ORDER TO ESCAPE WAR GENDER BASED VIOLENCE PERSECUTION OVER THERE. LGBTQ IDENTITY ECONOMIC DESTITUTE AND SO MANY OTHER ISSUES THAT MAKE LIFE IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE. FOR SO MANY REFUGEES AND IMMIGRANTS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN THEIR HOME AWAY FROM HOME MUCH LIKE MY OWN FAMILY. THEY ARE OUR STUDENTS OUR TEACHERS OUR NEIGHBORS AND OUR CONSTITUENTS. THEY ARE CALIFORNIANS IN CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS SOUGHT TO EMBRACE ITS DIVERSITY. WITH SO MANY HOSTILE AND UNWELCOMING MESSAGES FROM COUNTRIES WHO RECEIVE REFUGEES. THIS RESOLUTION WILL PROVIDE A MUCH NEEDED AFFIRMATION. THE REFUGEES ARE WELCOME. AND THAT REFUGEES ARE VALUED. THIS RESOLUTION BRINGS ATTENTION TO THE LIVES LOST. OF OSCAR I BET THE MARTINEZ FROM MEAT IS. A TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD FATHER WHO DROWNED ALONG SIZE HIS TWO YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. ANGIE BY LYDIA. AS HE TRIED TO RESCUE HER FROM THE CURRENTS OF THE RIO GRANDE. THEY WERE FLEEING MY HOME COUNTRY OF EL SALVADOR. IN SEARCH OF A BETTER LIFE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. HIS WIFE TANYA THE MOTHER OF ANGIE A PRECIOUS AN INNOCENT CHILD. SCREAMED IN HORROR FROM THE BANKS OF THE RIVER AS THIS TRAGEDY UNFOLDED. THE PHOTO OF THEIR BODIES LYING FACE DOWN TOGETHER. ALONG SIDE THE BANKS OF THE RIVER ACROSS BROWNSVILLE TEXAS HAVE BEEN SHARED ACROSS THE WORLD. THEIR PHOTO IS A REMINDER OF THE TWENTY FUND FOR THE TWENTY FIFTEEN PHOTO. A MILLION CURTI A THREE YEAR OLD BOY FROM SYRIA WHOSE BODY WASHED ASHORE BEACH IN TURKEY. AND SPARKED A WORLDWIDE CONVERSATION ON THE MEDITERRANEAN REFUGEE CRISIS. IMAGES OF OUR SHARED HUMANITY. HAVE OFTEN CHANGE THE COURSE. OF OUR HISTORY BUT THEY MIGHT THEY MUST FIRST CHANGE. OUR HEARTS AND OUR MINDS AND OUR SOCIETY. IN THEIR MEMORY AND THE MEMORY OF SO MANY OTHERS. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS CARILLO DOCTOR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I TO RISE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. I RISE IN HONOR OF WORLD REFUGEE DAY. TODAY WE HAVE THE HIGHEST NUMBER REFUGEES IN RECORDED HISTORY. AROUND THE WORLD OVER TWENTY TWO MILLION PEOPLE ARE FORCED FROM THEIR HOMES TO FLEE PERSECUTION AND VIOLENCE. THESE INDIVIDUALS OFTEN LEAVE MUCH BEHIND INCLUDING THEIR JOB THEIR FRIENDS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. THEY'VE BEEN EMBARK ON A LONG AND SOMETIMES DANGEROUS JOURNEY TO TRY TO GET TO SAFETY. IN THEIR NEW HOMES REFUGEES OFTEN FACE MANY CHALLENGES TO GAIN ASYLUM AND TO HEAL FROM THE TRAUMA. IT IS MOST ESSENTIAL THAT WE WELCOME THESE VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WITH COMPASSION REGARDLESS OF THE RACE RELIGION GENDER IDENTITY OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. THIS COMPASSION MUST BE REFLECTED IN IN IN OUR REFUGEE SETTLEMENT POLICIES AND WE MUST SUPPORT SUPPORT THEM IN CREATING A NEW LIFE. I CAN REMEMBER IN APPROXIMATELY NINETEEN NINETY WHEN THE FIRST -- ERITREANS AND SOMALIANS CAME TO CALIFORNIA. AND THEY WERE ALL SETTLED IN SAN DIEGO. AND I GOT A CALL ONE WEEKEND SAYING THAT THERE WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL COUPLE OF TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN SAN DIEGO AND AND MANY OF THEM WILL BE IN YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND SO WE HAD A TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE OF TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE WELCOMED. AND I WAS PROUD OF THE FACT THAT OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR COUNSELORS TOOK THEM IN UNDERSTOOD THE CHALLENGES THAT WOULD BE A TRIED TO MAKE A PLACE FOR THEM. IN OUR SCHOOLS AND HIRED INDIVIDUALS TO COME IT AND TO TO BASICALLY MAKE THE TRANSITION TO CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO A SMOOTH TRANSITION. AND IT'S INTERESTING THAT I SEE AS I SEE THE YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY WHO WERE ONCE A PART OF THAT -- THAT WHOLE TRANSITION THAT OCCURRED I SAW THE BRILLIANCE OF THE YOUNG FOLKS THAT ARE THERE THAT ARE NOW SERVING IN OUR COMMUNITIES SOME TWENTY THIRTY YEARS LATER WILL REALLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE. THE YOUNG MAN WHO WON THE FIRST AMERICANS TO WIN THE THE THE MARATHON IN NEW YORK OF THE BOSTON MARATHON OF WAS THERE AND HE WAS A MAN HE WAS A PART OF THE IMMIGRANTS. AND THE REFUGEE COMMUNITY INSTEAD DIEGO HE MADE HIS FAMILY IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO RUN EVERYWHERE AND THEY WERE WINNING ALL KINDS OF RACES IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND I REMEMBER CELEBRATING HIM AT SCHOOL BOARD MEETINGS AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN HE'S A CELEBRATED THE CROWN THE WORLD AND AND WAS PROMISING TO COME HERE. TO MEET US AND I THINK ABOUT HIM BECAUSE HE WAS A REFUGEE HIS FAMILY WAS THEY CAME HERE WITHOUT ANYTHING. AND THEY WILL EMBRACE FORTUNATELY BY THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY WHO FORMED A NUMBER OF ALLIANCES TO MAKE SURE THAT SOME THE TRANSITION WAS MOVED. BECAUSE THEY REALIZE THAT OFTENTIMES THE RECEPTION OF OF OF THE REFUGEE IS NOT AFRICAN IS NOT AFRICAN AMERICAN AND AS A RESULT WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO NOT INCLUDE THEM IN THE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE THERE ABOUT HOW DO WE CREATE. A SMOOTH TRANSITION HOW DO WE HONOR THEIR ETHNICITY IN THE CULTURE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT COME IN. A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN US WILL DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY BUT NONE THE LESS VALUE THEM AS INDIVIDUALS AND MAKING SURE THEY'RE PART OF IT. SAN DIEGO HAS AN AMAZING REFUGEE COMMUNITY NOW THAT HAS BEEN COMPLETELY INTEGRATED INTO OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR COMMUNITIES AND AND MAKES US PROUD EVERYDAY WHEN WE SEE THEM WE SEE THE KIND OF WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING AND THE THINGS THAT THEY'VE CONTRIBUTED TO US. SO IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE THINK ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY. A COUNTRY MADE OF REFUGEES BASICALLY FOLKS WHO COME FROM PLACES EVEN THE FIRST ONES WHO CAME HERE WERE FLEEING SO CALL RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION LOOKING FOR A PLACE IN WHICH THEY COULD LIVE. IN PEACE AND HARMONY WITH OTHERS THAT'S WHO WE ARE THAT'S WHAT THIS NATION IS ABOUT AND AS A RESULT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AN ONGOING RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THIS NATION REMAINS A PLACE A SAFE PLACE. FOR PEOPLE TO COME IT IS A PART OF THE LEGACY AND FOR US TO DENY THAT AS OUR LEGACY IS TO DENY WHO WE ARE. IT IS DOES NOT ALL THOSE WHO STRUGGLE SO HARD TO GIVE A FOUNDATION TO THIS NATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE A PLACE TO STAY. AFRICAN AMERICANS WOULD NEVER REFUGEES WE KNOW THAT THEY DIDN'T COME TO THIS COUNTRY WILLINGLY NOBODY SEEKING A SAFE HAVEN. AND SO WE UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE LEFT OUT BE LOCKED OUT AND DO NOT BE GIVEN A FULL CHANCE AND OPPORTUNITY AND AS A RESULT OF THAT THE COMPASSION IS GREAT IN OUR COMMUNITY SO THOSE WILL COME. AND THEY AN INTERFACE WITH OUR CHURCHES OUR COMMUNITY OUR SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS AND NOW WE'RE PART OF REALLY THE FABRIC OF THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR COMMUNITY SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I BILLS AG ARE. NINETEEN THANK YOU DOCTOR EVER THIS RUBIO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AJ ARE. NINETEEN I ALSO RISE AS AN IMMIGRANT WOMAN WHO EMPATHIZES WITH COUNTLESS WOMEN AROUND THE WORLD WHO SHARE MY BACKGROUND OF LEAVING THEIR HOME IN HOPES FOR A BETTER LIFE.
