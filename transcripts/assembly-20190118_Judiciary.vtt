TRYING TO GET PEOPLE.

00:37:37.054 --> 00:37:39.924
ALSO HAVE OTHER ACCESS AND THEY

00:37:39.991 --> 00:37:41.392
DON'T HAVE QUESTIONS.

00:37:41.459 --> 00:37:44.328
AND I FIND THAT VERY SERIOUSLY.

00:37:44.395 --> 00:37:47.264

AN ABORTION INDUSTRY.

00:37:51.736 --> 00:37:54.105
BECAUSE YOU TALK ABOUT --

00:37:54.171 --> 00:37:56.540
BIRTH MOM TWO GENERATIONS AGO.

00:37:56.607 --> 00:37:59.477
BUT MISSED GENERATION I WAS THE

00:37:59.543 --> 00:38:02.913
YOUNG WOMAN OF COLOR WHO IS I'M

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:05.349
MARRIED AND WALKED INTO A

00:38:05.416 --> 00:38:07.284
PLANNED PARENTHOOD WITH AN

00:38:07.351 --> 00:38:08.252
UNEXPECTED PREGNANCY.

00:38:08.319 --> 00:38:10.688
AND THAT PLANNED PARENTHOOD WHEN

00:38:10.755 --> 00:38:14.592
I SAID I HAD NO DOUBT THAT HAVE

00:38:14.659 --> 00:38:15.559
THAT CHILD.

00:38:15.626 --> 00:38:18.996
OFFERED TO LET ME HEAR THE HEART

00:38:19.063 --> 00:38:19.463
BEAT.

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:21.899
THAT'S NOT AN ABORTION INDUSTRY

00:38:21.966 --> 00:38:24.335
THAT IS CARING INDIVIDUALS TO

00:38:24.402 --> 00:38:26.771
ENSURE WORK THE SAFETY AND

00:38:26.837 --> 00:38:28.706
PARENTHOOD HAVE FAMILY PLANNING

00:38:28.773 --> 00:38:31.142
AVOID ABORTIONS AT ALL COSTS

00:38:31.208 --> 00:38:34.078
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO

00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:36.514
HAVE ABORTIONS I DON'T THINK

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:39.450
ANYONE WANTS PEOPLE TO HAVE A

00:38:39.517 --> 00:38:42.386
QUESTION I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT.

00:38:42.453 --> 00:38:44.321
ABORTION INDUSTRY TITLE EVEN

00:38:44.388 --> 00:38:46.757
COMES FROM ITS OFFENSES IT'S

00:38:46.824 --> 00:38:47.725
DEEPLY OFFENSIVE.

00:38:47.792 --> 00:38:51.162
BECAUSE MY MOM IN THE SAME YEAR

00:38:51.228 --> 00:38:54.098
SO YOUR TALK ABOUT YOUR MOTHER

00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:56.033
WORKING EMERGENCY ROOM WHEN

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.501
BEFORE WE WENT.

00:38:57.568 --> 00:39:00.438
AND THE STORY SHE TELLS ABOUT

00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:03.374
YOUNG WOMEN WHO CAME IN WITH

00:39:03.441 --> 00:39:05.810
POSH ABORTIONS THAT YOU'LL NOT

00:39:05.876 --> 00:39:09.246
ONLY THE BIG THE BABY IS HIGHER

00:39:09.313 --> 00:39:11.182
BUT THE GIRLS YOURSELF.

00:39:11.248 --> 00:39:13.117
THOSE ARE MY SKILLS.

00:39:13.184 --> 00:39:16.053
AND WHAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED IN

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.489
THE HIGH SEAS ESPECIALLY HOW

00:39:18.556 --> 00:39:20.925
CALIFORNIA WILL READ VALUE THE

00:39:20.991 --> 00:39:23.861
RIGHTS OF WOMEN TO TO HELPING

THE COMMUNITY IS THE APPOINTED

00:39:26.363 --> 00:39:26.764
SUBJECT.

00:39:26.831 --> 00:39:30.201
AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING.

00:39:30.267 --> 00:39:33.137
AND I THINK WE COULD WORK

00:39:33.204 --> 00:39:36.073
TOGETHER IF WE GOT PASSED SOME

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:38.509
OF THE JUST REVIEWED RHETORIC

00:39:38.576 --> 00:39:41.445
AND BIGGER OUT HOW WE CAN

00:39:41.512 --> 00:39:44.381
SUPPORT YOUR MOM TO MAKE THAT

00:39:44.448 --> 00:39:46.317
CHOICE HAVE CHILD ESPECIALLY

00:39:46.383 --> 00:39:48.753
THOSE WERE UNSUPPORTED AND I

00:39:48.819 --> 00:39:49.220
MERRY.

00:39:49.286 --> 00:39:52.656
AND WE SO SELDOM GET THIS KIND

00:39:52.723 --> 00:39:54.592
OF PASSION ABOUT THAT.

00:39:54.658 --> 00:39:57.027
AND INSTEAD WORK TOGETHER TO

00:39:57.094 --> 00:39:59.964
FIGURE OUT ALSO HOW WOMEN HAVE

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:00.431
ACCESS.

00:40:00.498 --> 00:40:02.366
TO MANY INTEL UNEXPECTEDLY.

00:40:02.433 --> 00:40:06.270
SO I I THINK YOU FOR FOR YOUR

00:40:06.337 --> 00:40:08.706
HEARTFELT TESTIMONY BUT I ALSO

00:40:08.773 --> 00:40:11.642
WANTED TO TO THANK THE PEOPLE

00:40:11.709 --> 00:40:13.577
WHO CAME HERE COMPANIES.

00:40:13.644 --> 00:40:16.013
BECAUSE ARE NOT AN OPTION

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:16.480
INDUSTRY.

00:40:16.547 --> 00:40:18.916
CARING INDIVIDUALS WHO CARE FOR

00:40:18.983 --> 00:40:21.852
WOMEN IN KEEP THEM IN STATE

00:40:21.919 --> 00:40:23.788
POSITIONS OF MAKING PROGRAMS

00:40:23.854 --> 00:40:24.755
RESOLUTION FLAT.

00:40:24.822 --> 00:40:28.659
I WAS ABLE TO SECOND AT THIS IS

00:40:28.726 --> 00:40:31.095
ALSO THE QUESTIONS COMMENTS WAS

00:40:31.162 --> 00:40:34.031
GALLAGHER. FOR THE SAME THE ONE

00:40:34.098 --> 00:40:36.467
ITEM ACTUALLY AGREEING THAT I

00:40:36.534 --> 00:40:39.403
HAVE TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW I

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:42.339
THINK WHEN YOU GET PASS PLANNING

00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:45.776
OUR FLAGS ON EACH SIDE WHERE WE

00:40:45.843 --> 00:40:48.212
DISAGREE AND I THINK THE

00:40:48.279 --> 00:40:51.148
FUNDAMENTAL WHY THIS IS STILL AN

00:40:51.215 --> 00:40:51.615
ISSUE.

00:40:51.682 --> 00:40:54.552
IS WE NEVER RECONCILE THE RIGHTS

00:40:54.618 --> 00:40:56.987
OF THE UNBORN CHILD --

00:40:57.054 --> 00:41:00.424
NEON SO ALSO AS A HUSBAND WHO

00:41:00.491 --> 00:41:02.860
WATCHES WIFE GO THROUGH THREE

00:41:02.927 --> 00:41:04.795
HIGHWAYS FOR HIGH RISK

00:41:04.862 --> 00:41:05.763
PREGNANCIES --

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:08.699
AND WAS THERE AT SEVENTEEN WEEKS

00:41:08.766 --> 00:41:11.635
WHEN THEY'RE AT UCSF WHEN THEY

00:41:11.702 --> 00:41:14.572
WERE DOING AN ECHO CARDIOGRAM ON

00:41:14.638 --> 00:41:15.539
THEIR TEAMS.

00:41:15.606 --> 00:41:17.975
MY TWINS TO BE HEARTS.

00:41:18.042 --> 00:41:20.411
THERE CLEARLY IS SOMETHING HERE

00:41:20.477 --> 00:41:23.347
THAT WE HAVE TO RECONCILE THAT

00:41:23.414 --> 00:41:23.814
THERE.

00:41:23.881 --> 00:41:26.250
THERE IS ANOTHER LIFE YOU'RE

00:41:26.317 --> 00:41:29.687
ALSO THIS A WOMAN'S LIFE AND IS

00:41:29.753 --> 00:41:30.154
ALSO.

00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:32.089
AN UNBORN CHILD --

00:41:32.156 --> 00:41:35.526
AND SO I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I

00:41:35.593 --> 00:41:39.430
WHERE I WANT TO SAY IS I THINK

00:41:39.496 --> 00:41:42.366
LIKE INSTEAD OF US LIKE CONTINUE

00:41:42.433 --> 00:41:44.802
TO PLANT FLAGS AND DO.

00:41:44.869 --> 00:41:45.769
RESOLUTIONS --

00:41:45.836 --> 00:41:48.706
LET'S HAVE A DISCUSSION HOW WE

00:41:48.772 --> 00:41:52.610

00:41:52.676 --> 00:41:56.046

AND HOW CAN WE RECOGNIZE THE

00:41:59.516 --> 00:42:03.354
RIGHT SET OF OF THE ON BOARD --

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:06.290
IT SHOULD BE A CHOICE BETWEEN.

00:42:06.357 --> 00:42:09.226
THOSE WHO ARE WANTED WE DO

00:42:09.293 --> 00:42:11.662
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SAVE.

00:42:11.729 --> 00:42:14.598
