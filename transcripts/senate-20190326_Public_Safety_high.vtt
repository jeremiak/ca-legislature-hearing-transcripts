THOSE.

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:26.359
SO WEIRD.

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.328
WE ARE GOING IN FILE ORDER WE

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:49.616
TWENTY TWO SENATOR LEYVA.

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:54.988

MADAM CHAIR LET'S SEVERAL YEARS

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.761
AGO THE PROMPT TESTING OF RAPE

KITS OR AS YOU TOLD US LAST TIME

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:07.033
SEXUAL ASSAULT KITS WE REMEMBER.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.301
AS YOU MAY REMEMBER GOVERNOR

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:10.537
BROWN VETOED SB FOURTEEN FORTY

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:11.638
NINE LAST YEAR.

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:13.039
BUT I KNOW THAT WE ALL REMAIN

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:14.541
COMMITTED TO MAKE THE PROPER

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:16.476
TESTING OF GREAT KIDS A REALITY

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:19.312
WITH THIS RE INTRODUCTION.

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:21.114
THOUGH THE GOVERNOR LAST YEAR

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:22.482
SEEM TO BELIEVE THAT A SIMPLE

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:23.817
AUDIT OF EXISTING RAPE KITS WAS

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:26.019
ENOUGH I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:27.220
SINCE THE BUT IT DOES NOTHING TO

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:29.255
ADVANCE AS CLOSER. TO ENSURING

00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:31.391
JUSTICE FOR SURVIVORS THE CORE

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:33.493
OF SB TWENTY TWO IS ACTUALLY

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.961
VERY SIMPLE BUT IT WILL HELP HOW

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:36.696
IT WILL HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:37.964
ON THE LIVES OF VICTIMS.

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:40.467
AND HELP REQUEST BEHIND BARS.

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.302
THIS MEASURE SIMPLY CHANGES ONE

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:44.537
WORD IN EXISTING LAW BYSAYING

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:46.239
THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:48.041
AND FORENSIC LABORATORIES SHALL

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:51.044
FOLLOW INSTEAD OF SHOULD FOLLOW

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.745
AS IT CURRENTLY STATES LISTED

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:54.280
TIME FRAMES FOR SUBMITTING AND

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:56.149
ANALYZING RAPE KIT EVIDENCE.

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:58.384
MEMBERS MEMBER MANY OF YOU MAY

00:01:58.451 --> 00:01:59.252
KNOW THAT JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.422
AGO GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED SB

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:03.056
EIGHT THIRTEEN WHICH ELIMINATED

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:04.991
THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:05.692
RATE.

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:06.659
THOUGH THAT WAS CERTAINLY A HUGE

00:02:06.726 --> 00:02:08.895
VICTORY THE ROAD TO JUSTICE FOR

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.964
VICTIMS OF RAPE AND SEXUAL

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.532
ASSAULT WILL BE INCOMPLETE IF

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.367
THE RAPE KITS ARE NEVER TESTED

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:15.568
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:16.836
ALL RAPE VICTIMS DESERVE TO HAVE

00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:18.972
THE RAPE KITS TESTED WITHIN THE

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:20.907
SPECIFIED TIME FRAME WHICH CAN

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.642
IN TURN HELP TO ENSURE JUSTICE

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:23.309
FOR VICTIMS.

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:25.712
IDENTIFY SERIAL PERPETRATORS AND

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:31.184
EVEN EXONERATE THE WRONGFULLY

00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:31.584
CONVICTED.

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:32.519
AS WE ALL KNOW RAPE IS ONE OF

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:33.753
THE MOST TRAUMATIZING THINGS

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.320
THAT CAN HELP TO HAPPEN TO

00:02:34.387 --> 00:02:34.587
SOMEONE.

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:35.188
AND THEN AFTERWARDS WHEN YOU

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:38.024
SUBMIT YOURSELF TO HAVING A

00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:39.459
SEXUAL ASSAULT KIT A RAPE KIT

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:42.028
DONE WHICH TAKES MANY MANY HOURS

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:43.563
AND O THINK THAT THAT IS NEVER

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.298
TESTED AND TO THINK THAT THAT IS

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:47.300
SITTING ON A SHELF SOMEPLACE.

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:48.868
IS JUST INEXCUSABLE.

00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:50.503
I'D LIKE TO REMIND EVERYONE OF

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.038
THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:53.907
WHICH SAID THAT HE THOUGHT WE

00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:56.075
SHOULD DO THE ODD AT FIRST.

00:02:56.142 --> 00:02:57.810
AND THEN WE WOULD GO FROM THERE.

00:02:57.877 --> 00:02:59.412
UNFORTUNATELY I RESPECTFULLY

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:00.914
DISAGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.081
BECAUSE I THINK HE MISSED THE

00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:03.550
ENTIRE POINT OF THE BILL WHICH

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:05.051
WAS TO MAKE SURE WE NEVER HAVE A

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:07.420
BACKLOG OF RAPE KITS AGAIN.

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:08.621
SO I HOPE GOOD MOVING FORWARD

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:09.956
THIS GETS TO OUR NEW GOVERNOR

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:12.659
AND HE SIGNS IT INTO LAW.

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:14.527

00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:31.958
OLD STUDENT.

00:06:32.024 --> 00:06:33.526
SEVERAL OF THESE CRIMES COULD

00:06:33.593 --> 00:06:34.093
HAVE BEEN PREVENTED WITH A

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.062
TIMELY TESTING OF A SINGLE

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:37.663

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:41.701
THESE CASES.

00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:42.301
I COULD READ HEADLINES LIKE

00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:44.403
DETROIT AND THE ASBURY CASE FROM

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:45.938
ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR HOURS.

00:06:46.005 --> 00:06:48.107
CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW SAYS LAW

00:06:48.174 --> 00:06:50.109
ENFORCEMENT SHOULD SEND IDS FOR

00:06:50.176 --> 00:06:50.376
TESTING.

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:51.878
THIS WAS A WELL INTENTIONED LOG

00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:53.513
BUT IT JUST ISN'T WORKING JOYFUL

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:54.881

TO EIGHT JURISDICTIONS.

00:06:58.317 --> 00:06:59.886
AND FOUND THAT SIX OUT OF THE

00:06:59.952 --> 00:07:00.753
EIGHT ARE NOT FOLLOWING THE

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.321
ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE LAW OR HAVE

00:07:02.388 --> 00:07:03.756
NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW MANY KIDS

00:07:03.823 --> 00:07:05.358
THEY ARE RECEIVING.

00:07:05.424 --> 00:07:06.425
THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:08.461
BY PASSING SB TWENTY TWO AND

00:07:08.528 --> 00:07:10.062

00:07:14.534 --> 00:07:15.234
THE STREET.

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:16.302
IT WILL ALSO DEMONSTRATE A

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:18.070
COMMITMENT TO SURVIVORS TO HELP

00:07:18.137 --> 00:07:19.672

QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- OUR

00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:13.593
LANGUAGE IS A VERY POWERFUL

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:15.261
THING AND WHILE THE WORD K&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.029
IS REFERRED.

00:08:17.096 --> 00:08:18.731
TO THINGS LIKE TOOL KIT AND

00:08:18.798 --> 00:08:20.766
SHAVING KITIT DOES TEND TO

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:23.102
REFER MORE COMMONLY TWO ITEMS

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.137
ASSOCIATED WITH FEMALES SEWING

00:08:25.204 --> 00:08:26.572
KIT MAKE UP KITS THINGS LIKE

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:27.106
THAT [inaudible]

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:31.110
AND WELL WE KNOW THAT ONE OF THE

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:34.280
REASONS THE DATA SHOWS THAT THAT.

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:36.949
THESE -- THAT THE SEXUAL ASSAULT

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:39.518
EVIDENCE IS NOT TESTED IS

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:41.520
BECAUSE IT IS COMMONLY.

00:08:41.587 --> 00:08:43.256
A FEMALE WHO HAS EXPERIENCE THE

00:08:43.322 --> 00:08:44.991
ASSAULT [inaudible]

00:08:45.057 --> 00:08:47.793
AND UNFORTUNATELY.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.095
WHETHER IT'S IMPLICIT BIAS WHO

00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:51.163
KNOWS.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.832
THE BY I SHOULD SAY WHO KNOWS

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:55.801
THERE IS A VERY STE RESEARCH BUT

00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:56.435
I CAN ASIDE BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE

00:08:56.502 --> 00:08:58.104
IN FRONT OF ME.

00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.805
THESE CRIMES ARE NOT TAKEN AS

00:08:59.872 --> 00:09:02.108
SERIOUSLY SO THAT'S THE EVIDENCE

00:09:02.174 --> 00:09:05.077
IS NOT PUT INTO THE DNA DATABASE

00:09:05.144 --> 00:09:06.012
AND WE DON'T GET THE CRIMES

00:09:06.078 --> 00:09:08.114
RESOLVE.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.749
THE FACT IS IS THAT THERE'S A

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:11.183
VERY LARGE PERCENT OF WOMEN

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.752
STILL.

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:14.553
MEN AND WOMEN BUT WHO DO NOT

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.857
REPORT THEIR SEXUAL ASSAULTS.

00:09:17.924 --> 00:09:20.159
AND OF COURSE IF YOU EVER READ

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:21.494
ABOUT.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.762
FOLKS LIKE THE WOMAN IN SAN

00:09:22.828 --> 00:09:26.499
FRANCISCO WHO -- WENT TO THE

00:09:26.565 --> 00:09:27.700
TROUBLE OF GETTING HER WHOLE

00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:29.302
MEDICAL EXAMINATION AND HER

00:09:29.368 --> 00:09:30.403
EVIDENCE.

00:09:30.469 --> 00:09:32.772
SUBMITTED AND THEN IT WAS NEVER

00:09:32.838 --> 00:09:35.007
SUBMITTED TO THE IT WAS NEVER

00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:36.776
TESTED.

00:09:36.842 --> 00:09:38.978
AND SHE KEPT RETURNING TO THE

00:09:39.045 --> 00:09:40.947
POLICE OFFICE POLICE DEPARTMENT

00:09:41.013 --> 00:09:42.915
AND WOULD NOT GET ANY ANSWER.

00:09:42.982 --> 00:09:44.183
I MEAN THESE ARE THE KINDS OF

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.484
THINGS THAT WOULD DISCOURAGE

00:09:45.551 --> 00:09:48.187
THERE'S ALREADY SHAME -- FOR IT

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:49.188
MEETING THAT YOU WERE SEXUALLY

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:50.957
ASSAULTED THERE'S ALREADY SHAME

00:09:51.023 --> 00:09:52.825
TO EVEN REPORT YOUR CRIME.

00:09:52.892 --> 00:09:54.393
SO WHY WOULD YOU REPORT IF YOU

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.195
THINK THERE IT I WILL THE LAN

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:57.163
PERSONS NOT GONNA TAKE IT

00:09:57.229 --> 00:09:58.130
SERIOUSLY SO.

00:09:58.197 --> 00:10:00.800
I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT

00:10:00.866 --> 00:10:01.367
THE PRIMARY REASON IT DIDN'T

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:03.169
HAVE.

00:10:03.235 --> 00:10:05.838
SHOULD -- SHOT WHATEVER.

00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:06.072
SHALL.

00:10:06.138 --> 00:10:07.707
USE ME IN MY ORIGINAL BILLS

00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:09.175
BECAUSE AT THE TIME AND I WAS

00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:11.077
CARRYING THE BILL WE HAD SHE

00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:13.179

THROUGH A PROPS.

00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:19.285

00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:56.321
TURNS OUT THAT IN TWO THOUSAND

00:25:56.388 --> 00:25:56.988
SEVENTEEN THE STUDY BY THE PRE

SAFEGUARDS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR TWO

00:26:36.328 --> 00:26:38.897
REASONS MEMBERS ONE RISK

ASSESSMENT TOOLS LACK OPENNESS

00:26:40.699 --> 00:26:42.367
AND TRANSPARENCY NECESSARY FOR

AN HONEST EVALUATION.

00:26:43.702 --> 00:26:45.570
ELIMINATION OF DISPARATE INCOME

FACTORS AND SECONDLY. TO ENSURE

00:26:51.776 --> 00:26:53.244
THE ACCURACY THE TOOLS NEED TO

00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:54.279
GO THROUGH WHAT IS CALLED THE

00:26:54.346 --> 00:26:56.081

LOCALIZE DATA.

00:27:02.687 --> 00:27:04.923
AND SO WITH THIS BILL WE ARE

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:06.558
PUTTING ON WE WERE NOT REQUIRING

00:27:06.624 --> 00:27:08.893

CALIFORNIA MUST BE TRANSPARENT

00:27:38.256 --> 00:27:39.357
THAT MEANS THE COUNTIES NEED TO

00:27:39.424 --> 00:27:40.959
TELL THE PUBLIC EXACTLY HOW THE

00:27:41.026 --> 00:27:41.726
RISK.

00:27:41.793 --> 00:27:42.994
ASSESSMENT SCORES ARE BEING

00:27:43.061 --> 00:27:44.295
CALCULATED NOTHING WORSE THAN

00:27:44.362 --> 00:27:46.131
YOU HAVE A TOOL SOMEONE SAYS --

00:27:46.197 --> 00:27:47.232
YOUR HIGH RISK WE DON'T EVEN

00:27:47.298 --> 00:27:48.833
KNOW WHY OR WHAT THE FACTORS ARE

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:49.934
WHAT THEY CONSIDERED WHETHER

00:27:50.001 --> 00:27:51.770
COMMUNITIES OVER POLICE TO

00:27:51.836 --> 00:27:53.071
WHATEVER IT WAS.

00:27:53.138 --> 00:27:54.072
AND THREE COUNTIES DUE TO

00:27:54.139 --> 00:27:55.940
COLLECT AND RETAIN AND PUBLISH

00:27:56.007 --> 00:27:57.142
DATA ON THEIR PRE TRIAL RISK

00:27:57.208 --> 00:27:58.777
ASSESSMENT TOOLS SO THAT THEY

00:27:58.843 --> 00:28:03.615
CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO

00:28:03.681 --> 00:28:05.517
COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE.

00:28:05.583 --> 00:28:06.451
SO THIS IS IT'S CERTAINLY GREW

00:28:06.518 --> 00:28:07.218
OUT OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE'VE

00:28:07.285 --> 00:28:08.186
BEEN ENGAGED IN THIS LONG

00:28:08.253 --> 00:28:09.020
DISCUSSION ON BAIL.

00:28:09.087 --> 00:28:10.455
ARM IN DEALING WITH THIS VERY

00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:12.957
DIFFICULT ISSUE OF MAKING SURE

00:28:13.024 --> 00:28:14.859

MADE A DETERMINATION WITH THAT A

00:28:22.734 --> 00:28:25.403
GOOD WITNESSES WILL TESTIFY AND

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.939
FAVORS MEASURE.

00:28:28.006 --> 00:28:30.175

SAFETY FOR FORTY FOUR YEARS.

00:28:36.614 --> 00:28:37.816
THIRTY ONE YEARS SO -- DIVIDED

00:28:37.882 --> 00:28:39.918
BETWEEN INGLEWOOD PD FOR ABOUT

00:28:39.984 --> 00:28:41.519
TWENTY WAS SACRAMENTO PD FOR

00:28:41.586 --> 00:28:42.987
ABOUT.

00:28:43.054 --> 00:28:45.190
ELEVEN I RETIRED AND THEN IN --

00:28:45.256 --> 00:28:46.024
TWO THOUSAND SIX LIFE CHANGING

00:28:46.091 --> 00:28:46.791
EVENT.

00:28:46.858 --> 00:28:48.359
I WAS ASKED TO BECOME THE

00:28:48.426 --> 00:28:49.427
DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA DOLE

00:28:49.494 --> 00:28:51.362
PAROLE.

00:28:51.429 --> 00:28:52.097
WELL IT WAS LIFE CHANGING IN

00:28:52.163 --> 00:28:55.133
MANY WAYS -- MOST -- GRAPHICALLY

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.502
THAT THERE IS SO MUCH OF SCIENCE

00:28:57.569 --> 00:28:59.938
RESEARCH AND DATA ANALYSIS

00:29:00.004 --> 00:29:01.606
AROUND THE CALIFORNIA.

00:29:01.673 --> 00:29:03.775
A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND OR

00:29:03.842 --> 00:29:04.609
INMATES AND PAROLEES

00:29:04.676 --> 00:29:07.212
SPECIFICALLY THAT I HAD NOT BEEN

00:29:07.278 --> 00:29:08.113
AWARE OF PRIOR TO BEING THE

00:29:08.179 --> 00:29:09.180
PAROLE DIRECTOR.

00:29:09.247 --> 00:29:11.316
IN THE PROCESS OF EDUCATING

00:29:11.382 --> 00:29:12.250
MYSELF AROUND THE DUTIES AND

00:29:12.317 --> 00:29:14.219
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE ROLE I

00:29:14.285 --> 00:29:17.155
WAS AND I WAS INTRODUCED TO THE

00:29:17.222 --> 00:29:18.656
CONCEPT OF A RISK ASSESSMENT.

00:29:18.723 --> 00:29:19.958
SOMETHING THAT I HAD NOT HAD

00:29:20.024 --> 00:29:22.293
EXPOSURE TO AS A POLICE CHIEF OR

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.095
IN ANY OF THE PREVIOUS THIRTY

00:29:24.162 --> 00:29:25.930
ONE YEARS.

00:29:25.997 --> 00:29:28.032
THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS IS

00:29:28.099 --> 00:29:32.070
CERTAINLY NOT INTENDED TO BE THE

00:29:32.137 --> 00:29:33.505
SOLE SOURCE OF A DECISION MAKING

00:29:33.571 --> 00:29:35.039
AN UNDERTAKING.

00:29:35.106 --> 00:29:36.541
A RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS ARE

00:29:36.608 --> 00:29:40.078
DESIGNED TO BE ABOUT 75%

00:29:40.145 --> 00:29:41.179
ACCURATE.

00:29:41.246 --> 00:29:42.013
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.048
UNDERSTAND IF YOU AND I WERE TO

00:29:44.115 --> 00:29:45.350
MAKE A CLINICAL JUDGMENT OF

00:29:45.416 --> 00:29:47.352
SOMEBODY'S RESEARCH WILL HE OR

00:29:47.418 --> 00:29:48.686
SHE COME BACK WILL HE OR SHE

00:29:48.753 --> 00:29:50.121
COMMITTED AN OFFENSE.

00:29:50.188 --> 00:29:51.456
YOU'RE GOING TO BE RIGHT ABOUT

00:29:51.523 --> 00:29:52.557
HALF THE TIME.

00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:54.325
AND SO BY OVERLY IN THE DECISION

00:29:54.392 --> 00:29:55.994
MAKING PROCESS WITH A VALID A

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:57.729
RISK ASSESSMENT TOOL WE IMPROVE

00:29:57.795 --> 00:29:59.597
OUR CAPACITY TO BE RIGHT BY

00:29:59.664 --> 00:30:00.999
ABOUT 25%.

00:30:01.065 --> 00:30:03.668
NOT PERFECT BUT CERTAINLY I

00:30:03.735 --> 00:30:06.337
THINK THIS MEETS A THRESHOLD AS

00:30:06.404 --> 00:30:06.738
ONE OF THE BIGGEST

00:30:06.804 --> 00:30:08.239
RESPONSIBILITY THE PUBLIC SAFETY

00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:10.375
LEADERS IN IS THAT IT IS TO BE

00:30:10.441 --> 00:30:11.309
ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE TO OUR

00:30:11.376 --> 00:30:11.943
PUBLIC.

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:13.444
AND THOSE OF YOU WHO SERVE AS

00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:14.979
OUR LEADERS IN THE IN THE U. A

00:30:15.046 --> 00:30:16.214
POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT THAT WE

00:30:16.281 --> 00:30:18.082
ARE TAKING EVERY REASONABLE STEP

00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:19.350
TO MITIGATE.

00:30:19.417 --> 00:30:20.919
THE RISKS THAT ARE DECISIONS

00:30:20.985 --> 00:30:21.986
MAKE TO THE LOWEST COMMON

00:30:22.053 --> 00:30:24.255
DENOMINATOR WE CAN RISK

00:30:24.322 --> 00:30:27.125
ASSESSMENT ACCOMPLISHES THAT --

00:30:27.192 --> 00:30:29.160
IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO TO KNOW

00:30:29.227 --> 00:30:30.395
THAT THE THE AND MORE ROOMS ARE

00:30:30.461 --> 00:30:32.363
VERY SUPPORTIVE OF SB THIRTY SIX

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:34.399
AS HAVING A TOOL IS ONE THING.

00:30:34.465 --> 00:30:36.234
THE VALIDATION PROCESS IS

00:30:36.301 --> 00:30:38.870
ENTIRELY ANOTHER AND AND AND IT

00:30:38.937 --> 00:30:40.538
VERY IMPORTANT BUT IN A NUTSHELL

00:30:40.605 --> 00:30:42.273
WHAT A VALIDATION PROCESS DOES

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:43.741
IS IT'S IF YOU HAVE ANY NUMBER

00:30:43.808 --> 00:30:45.343
OF PEOPLE THAT YOU RATED OVER

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:47.178
THE COURSE OF THREE YEARS OR

00:30:47.245 --> 00:30:48.146
WHATEVER TIME PERIOD.

00:30:48.213 --> 00:30:49.380
LET'S JUST SAY YOU RATED.

00:30:49.447 --> 00:30:50.915
A LOTS OF THEM AS LOW RISK.

00:30:50.982 --> 00:30:52.850
AND DISPROPORTIONATELY LOW RISK

00:30:52.917 --> 00:30:54.285
PEOPLE OF ARE COMMITTING CRIMES

00:30:54.352 --> 00:30:56.187
ARE NOT SHOWING UP -- FOR THE

00:30:56.254 --> 00:30:58.556
TRIAL THE TOOLS CAN BE ADJUSTED

00:30:58.623 --> 00:31:00.491
SO THAT THE THRESHOLD FOR THE

00:31:00.558 --> 00:31:02.827
RATINGS REFLECT THE REALITY THAT

00:31:02.894 --> 00:31:04.262
YOU'RE GETTING OUT OF THE TOOL

00:31:04.329 --> 00:31:04.862
AND HOW THE COMMUNITY YOU'RE

00:31:04.929 --> 00:31:06.097
SERVING.

00:31:06.164 --> 00:31:07.265

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:57.681
THE TABLE AND THEN THE OTHERS

00:46:57.748 --> 00:47:06.590
JUST AT THE MIKE.

00:47:06.657 --> 00:47:07.691
GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE GOING

BACK IS FOR DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE

00:47:09.359 --> 00:47:10.160
DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE IS A

00:47:10.227 --> 00:47:12.596
NATIONAL NON PROFIT DEDICATED.

00:47:12.663 --> 00:47:14.364
TO REPLACING THE FAILED DRUG WAR

00:47:14.431 --> 00:47:15.599
WITH POLICIES BASED ON

00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:18.402
COMPASSION SCIENCE PUBLIC HEALTH

00:47:18.468 --> 00:47:21.872
AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS --

00:47:21.939 --> 00:47:23.607
WE OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE IT'S

00:47:23.674 --> 00:47:25.275
BUILT ON THE SAME POLICIES THAT

00:47:25.342 --> 00:47:25.976
FAILED TO PROTECT US FROM

00:47:26.043 --> 00:47:27.744
PROBLEMS RELATED TO HEROIN

00:47:27.811 --> 00:47:29.947
COCAINE AND FUN.

00:47:30.013 --> 00:47:31.582
IT WILL ADD AN ADDITIONAL THREE

00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:32.983
TWENTY FIVE YEARS THE SENTENCES

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:34.818
AND WILL NOT REDUCE AVAILABILITY

00:47:34.885 --> 00:47:36.687
A FINAL.

00:47:36.753 --> 00:47:37.354
IT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO PRISON

00:47:37.421 --> 00:47:38.555
OVERCROWDING.

00:47:38.622 --> 00:47:39.723
AN OVERLY LONG SENTENCES FOR

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:42.092
PEOPLE INCLUDING LOW LEVEL DRUG

00:47:42.159 --> 00:47:43.193
MEALS.

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:45.095
AND PEOPLE IN POSSESSION OF A

00:47:45.162 --> 00:47:46.296
SUBSTANCE THAT CONTAINS FENNEL

00:47:46.363 --> 00:47:48.699
AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW IT.

00:47:48.765 --> 00:47:50.300
TYPICALLY DEFENDANTS WHO HAVE NO

00:47:50.367 --> 00:47:53.203
INFORMATION TO TRADE.

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:54.705
LOW LEVEL ON THE TOTEM POLE

00:47:54.771 --> 00:47:55.205
[inaudible]

00:47:55.272 --> 00:48:00.777
AND NOT EMPOWERED TO SAY NO.

00:48:00.844 --> 00:48:01.378
TO DRUG DEALERS ABOUT THEM IN

00:48:01.445 --> 00:48:03.213
THE SYSTEM.

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.014
IT WOULD APPLY THE SAME

00:48:04.081 --> 00:48:05.449
PENALTIES TO SUBSTANCES

00:48:05.515 --> 00:48:06.917
CONTAINING FENTANYL THAT HAVE

00:48:06.984 --> 00:48:08.518
BEEN APPLIED TO DECADES TO

00:48:08.585 --> 00:48:10.554
COCAINE AND HEROIN.

00:48:10.621 --> 00:48:12.122
AND WE KNOW THAT APPLYING THESE

00:48:12.189 --> 00:48:13.523
ENHANCEMENTS DIDN'T WORK.

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:14.725
COCAINE AND HEROIN ARE MORE

00:48:14.791 --> 00:48:16.126
WIDELY AVAILABLE MORE POWERFUL

00:48:16.193 --> 00:48:17.828
AND CHEAPER THAN EVER BEFORE SO

00:48:17.894 --> 00:48:19.930
WHY WOULD WE USE THE SAME FAILED

00:48:19.997 --> 00:48:23.133
APPROACH FOR FEDERAL.

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:23.734
ALSO THERE'S THE COST BENEFIT

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:28.071
QUESTION. ONE YEAR OF PRISON

00:48:28.138 --> 00:48:29.506
COST EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ONE

00:48:29.573 --> 00:48:32.009
YEAR OF METHADONE TREATMENT.

00:48:32.075 --> 00:48:32.609
IS FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED

00:48:32.676 --> 00:48:35.045
DOLLARS.

00:48:35.112 --> 00:48:36.213
WE BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT IT'S

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.881
MORE INTELLIGENT TO SEND

00:48:37.948 --> 00:48:39.016
SEVENTEEN PEOPLE TO METHADONE

00:48:39.082 --> 00:48:40.984
THEN PUT EVEN ONE PERSON IN

00:48:41.051 --> 00:48:42.653
PRISON FOR ANOTHER YEAR.

00:48:42.719 --> 00:48:43.954
IT'S MORE COST EFFECTIVE AND

00:48:44.021 --> 00:48:46.323
ENHANCES PUBLIC SAFETY.

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:48.258
THE APPROACH SUGGEST SB ONE

00:48:48.325 --> 00:48:49.226
SIXTY ONE DIDN'T WORK FOR

00:48:49.293 --> 00:48:50.827
COCAINE AND HEROIN IT WON'T WORK

00:48:50.894 --> 00:48:52.629
FOR FEDERAL.

00:48:52.696 --> 00:48:54.264
WE STRONGLY ADVISE THE SENATE

00:48:54.331 --> 00:48:56.099
AND THE ASSEMBLY TO INVEST IN

00:48:56.166 --> 00:48:56.533
TREATMENT.

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:59.102
PUBLIC HEALTH AND HARM REDUCTION

00:48:59.169 --> 00:49:03.173

ALSO ADD THAT THERE'S NO DOUBT

00:49:20.023 --> 00:49:22.025
THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE

00:49:22.092 --> 00:49:23.694
AND FINAL RELATED DEATHS AND

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:26.063
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT.

00:49:26.129 --> 00:49:28.098
FINAL IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS

00:49:28.165 --> 00:49:28.498
DRUG.

00:49:28.565 --> 00:49:31.101
HOWEVER SB ONE SIXTY ONE IS NOT

00:49:31.168 --> 00:49:33.603
GOING TO CHANGE EITHER OF THOSE

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:34.671
FACTORS.

UP TO FIVE YEARS IN JAIL FOR

00:49:53.256 --> 00:49:54.891
SIMPLY OFFERING TO GIVE AWAY

00:49:54.958 --> 00:49:58.495
FINAL THERE IS NO NEED TO EXPAND

00:49:58.562 --> 00:49:59.930
THE LAW FURTHER.

00:49:59.996 --> 00:50:01.665
SECOND SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS

00:50:01.732 --> 00:50:03.867
HAVE BEEN STUDIED EXTENSIVELY

00:50:03.934 --> 00:50:04.701
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND HAVE

00:50:04.768 --> 00:50:07.671
GENERATED NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE

00:50:07.738 --> 00:50:10.107
THAT THEY DID TO HER OR PREVENT

ENHANCEMENT AT ISSUE IN THIS

00:50:13.944 --> 00:50:15.879
BILL AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID WE

00:50:15.946 --> 00:50:17.381
NEED LOOK NO FURTHER THAN OUR

00:50:17.447 --> 00:50:19.316
OWN BACKYARD TO SEE THAT THIS

00:50:19.383 --> 00:50:21.318
ADDITIONAL PUNISHMENT AS APPLIED

00:50:21.385 --> 00:50:22.753
TO OTHER DRUGS.

00:50:22.819 --> 00:50:25.088
HAS NOT WORKED.

00:50:25.155 --> 00:50:26.289
DESPITE THE FACT THAT THESE

00:50:26.356 --> 00:50:28.024
ENHANCEMENTS ARE ALREADY

00:50:28.091 --> 00:50:31.094

THAT THE EXISTING ENHANCEMENTS

00:50:49.679 --> 00:50:51.114
HAVE NOT IMPROVED OUR SAFETY

00:50:51.181 --> 00:50:52.182
THERE IS LITTLE SENSE AND

00:50:52.249 --> 00:50:54.117
EXTENDING THE POLICY TO YET

00:50:54.184 --> 00:50:55.652

WAR ON DRUGS.

00:51:03.493 --> 00:51:05.796
WHICH WITH A HARMFUL FAILED

00:51:05.862 --> 00:51:07.197
APPROACH TO DRUG POLICY THAT HAS

00:51:07.264 --> 00:51:09.132
BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY

00:51:09.199 --> 00:51:10.367
DISINVESTMENT IN LOW INCOME

HOWEVER.

00:52:34.618 --> 00:52:37.053
I AM CLEAR THAT FINN TO KNOW IS

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.256
A BAD ACTOR THAT DOES GOES

00:52:39.322 --> 00:52:40.323
WITHOUT SAY.

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:42.993
THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE I THINK WE

00:52:43.059 --> 00:52:44.561

00:52:44.628 --> 00:52:47.030
I SPENT -- QUITE A BIT OF TIME

00:52:47.097 --> 00:52:49.199

00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:45.221
SHOULD BE DIFFERENT.

00:53:45.288 --> 00:53:47.023

00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:22.459
WILL AND AND AND HAVE A

00:54:22.525 --> 00:54:24.394
MEANINGFUL COP PUBLIC POLICY

00:54:24.461 --> 00:54:28.531
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW.

00:54:28.598 --> 00:54:30.767
TO BE TRUE TODAY -- I CAN'T

00:54:30.834 --> 00:54:34.404
SUPPORT. EIGHT A CITIZEN HAND

00:54:34.471 --> 00:54:37.107
SMIT BILL WEYAND THE RESEARCH

00:54:37.173 --> 00:54:39.109
STACKS AS HIGH AS I AM TALL

00:54:39.175 --> 00:54:41.978
ABOUT HOW THAT DIDN'T BOLD WHALE

00:54:42.045 --> 00:54:43.813
FOR US AS THE STATE --

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:46.983
ECONOMICALLY IT HAD ZERO IMPACT

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:48.318
ON THE AVAILABILITY OF DRUGS ON

00:54:48.385 --> 00:54:50.754
THE STREETS IT HAD NO IMPACT ON

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:52.522
IMPROVING PUBLIC SAFETY AND SO

00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:54.524
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN CONTINUING

00:54:54.591 --> 00:54:57.827
POLICIES THAT WE KNOW DON'T WORK --

00:54:57.894 --> 00:54:59.396
I THINK IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE OF US

00:54:59.462 --> 00:55:01.231
TO SIMPLY DO THAT AS OPPOSED TO

00:55:01.297 --> 00:55:03.366
STEPPING BACK AND REALLY TRYING

00:55:03.433 --> 00:55:05.235
TO FIGURE OUT A BRIEF ALL THE

00:55:05.301 --> 00:55:06.770
PARTIES TO TOGETHER THAT IN A

00:55:06.836 --> 00:55:07.804
DISCUSSION.

00:55:07.871 --> 00:55:11.775
ABOUT WHAT CAN SO I'M HOPING --

00:55:11.841 --> 00:55:14.744

CO CONVENER IN THAT KIND OF

00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:21.351
CONVERSATION.

00:55:21.418 --> 00:55:23.186
BUT IN THE MEANTIME I I I CANNOT

00:55:23.253 --> 00:55:25.722
AND WILL NOT CONTINUE TO SUPPORT

00:55:25.789 --> 00:55:28.558
BILLS -- THAT THAT WE HAVE

00:55:28.625 --> 00:55:30.994
PROVEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN DON'T

HAVE THE OUTCOME WE ANTICIPATE.

00:55:34.397 --> 00:55:35.799
SO FOR THOSE REASONS I WON'T BE

FOCUSED ON HEROIN AND COCAINE.

00:55:58.855 --> 00:56:00.090
WE SHOULD ALSO PROVIDE SOME KIND

CERTAINLY I DO YOU AND I I GUESS

00:56:17.841 --> 00:56:19.209
WHAT IS FRUSTRATING ALL ABOUT

00:56:19.275 --> 00:56:21.745
THIS BILL IS THAT WE WE VIEW IT

00:56:21.811 --> 00:56:23.413
FROM THE EYES OF THE USER.

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:24.781
AND THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WE

00:56:24.848 --> 00:56:26.583
ARE REALLY TRYING TO HELP WITH

00:56:26.649 --> 00:56:28.151
OUR REHABILITATION EFFORTS.

00:56:28.218 --> 00:56:30.353
IN OUR NONSENSE ENHANCEMENTS

00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:32.222
SENDING THEM TO REHABILITATION.

00:56:32.288 --> 00:56:33.623
THIS BILL AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:35.225
TO DO IS NOT ABOUT THE GUY THAT

00:56:35.291 --> 00:56:36.392
USE IT IS ABOUT ABOUT THE GUY

00:56:36.459 --> 00:56:37.560
WHO IS PRODUCING IT IN MASS

00:56:37.627 --> 00:56:39.129
QUANTITIES AND BRING IT INTO

00:56:39.195 --> 00:56:40.096
THIS COUNTRY.

00:56:40.163 --> 00:56:42.098
I GUARANTEE YOU AND ALL OF THE

00:56:42.165 --> 00:56:44.134
LITERATURE AND CERTAINLY THE

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:45.268
MOVIES THAT HAVE BEEN ABOUT THIS

00:56:45.335 --> 00:56:46.603
BOTH DOCUMENTARY AND IN

00:56:46.669 --> 00:56:47.737
FICTIONAL.

00:56:47.804 --> 00:56:51.775
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT THE HEAD

00:56:51.841 --> 00:56:52.776
OF THIS DON'T USE.

00:56:52.842 --> 00:56:53.943
THEY REALLY ARE PROFITEERS AND

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:55.745
THE RINGING IN LARGE QUANTITIES

00:56:55.812 --> 00:56:57.447
THAT ARE THEN BROKEN DOWN AND

00:56:57.514 --> 00:56:58.948
LACED INTO THESE OTHER DRUGS.

00:56:59.015 --> 00:57:00.583
THEY DO HAVE SENSE ENHANCEMENTS

00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:02.552
BUT INTO YOU CUT OFF.

00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:05.088
THE IMPORTATION OF THESE LARGE

00:57:05.155 --> 00:57:07.190
QUANTITIES YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

00:57:07.257 --> 00:57:08.424
SOLVE THE PROBLEM THAT FELT NOW

00:57:08.491 --> 00:57:10.126
IS PRODUCING AND CREATING IN

00:57:10.193 --> 00:57:11.161
THIS COUNTRY.

00:57:11.227 --> 00:57:12.896
THERE'S A NATIONAL CONCERN NOW

00:57:12.962 --> 00:57:14.831
IT'S BEEN ON CNN.

00:57:14.898 --> 00:57:16.800
IT'S BEYOND ME AND ON NBC AND

00:57:16.866 --> 00:57:18.835
WHAT THIS DRUG IS DOING AND I'D

00:57:18.902 --> 00:57:20.003
LIKE TO SUGGEST IT IS SO

00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:23.106
DANGEROUS THAT IT CAN BE USED WE

00:57:23.173 --> 00:57:24.774
CERTAINLY KNOW BY TERRORISTS.

00:57:24.841 --> 00:57:26.042
IN IF WE DON'T STOP THE

00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:28.077
IMPORTATION IN THESE LARGE

00:57:28.144 --> 00:57:29.813
QUANTITIES THAT IT WILL BE ON

00:57:29.879 --> 00:57:31.948

HORRIFIC OF HAPPENS SO I AM.

00:57:34.017 --> 00:57:35.618
I THINK WHAT SENATOR MITCHELL

00:57:35.685 --> 00:57:37.487
SAID HERE PERHAPS THAT'S THE

00:57:37.554 --> 00:57:39.556
PATH WE OUGHT.

00:57:39.622 --> 00:57:41.691
TO DO A LITTLE SIDE STEP ON THAT

00:57:41.758 --> 00:57:43.893
I WILL NOT FEES TRYING TO DO

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:46.162
SOMETHING ABOUT THE IMPORTATION.

00:57:46.229 --> 00:57:48.097
OF THIS DRUG WHICH IS KILLING

00:57:48.164 --> 00:57:49.699
OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE PEOPLE

00:57:49.766 --> 00:57:51.000
WHO ARE DOING IT.

00:57:51.067 --> 00:57:53.102
IF NOT TOUCHING THEM IT'S NOT

00:57:53.169 --> 00:57:54.737

MAKING THIS A STUDY BILL.

00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:48.117

WE'RE NOT GOING TO DISCOURAGE

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:03.266
THEM FROM MAKING MILLIONS OF

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:04.734

ONES THAT WE CATCH AND THE THE

01:00:18.715 --> 01:00:20.249
PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:42.705
SOMETHING THAT COULD BE DONE TO

01:00:42.772 --> 01:00:44.474

SOMETHING WE HAVE TRIED FOR

01:00:57.887 --> 01:00:58.654
YEARS THINKING THAT WOULD

01:00:58.721 --> 01:01:00.323
DISCOURAGE PEOPLE IF WE GAVE

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:02.325
THEM LONG PRISON SENTENCES BUT

01:01:02.392 --> 01:01:04.260
IT HASN'T DONE A THING.

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:06.729
SO I WOULD -- I WOULD SUPPORT A

01:01:06.796 --> 01:01:08.364
MEASURE THAT THAT THIS MEASURE

01:01:08.431 --> 01:01:10.466
IF IT COULD BECOME A STUDY BILL

01:01:10.533 --> 01:01:11.734
TO TRY TO FIND OUT THE MOST

01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:19.108
EFFECTIVE WAY. TO REDUCE THE

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:20.910
AMOUNT OF FENNEL OR TO TO GET

01:01:20.977 --> 01:01:21.711
RID OF FENNEL OVERALL THERE MUST

01:01:21.778 --> 01:01:22.745
BE SOMETHING WE CAN DO BUT I I

01:01:22.812 --> 01:01:24.313
AGREE I DON'T THINK THAT.

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:26.682
ADDING AN ENHANCEMENT OR PENALTY

01:01:26.749 --> 01:01:29.252
IT HAS IN ANY WAY DONE ANYTHING

01:01:29.318 --> 01:01:31.287
TO REDUCE OUR DRUG -- ISSUES IN

01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:32.989
THIS STATE AND COUNTRY WHICH I

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:34.991
KNOW IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO SO

01:01:35.058 --> 01:01:35.958
IF YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO DO

01:01:36.025 --> 01:01:37.660
THAT I WOULD CERTAINLY.

01:01:37.727 --> 01:01:40.563
BE SUPPORTIVE BUT AS THE BILL IS

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:42.765
NOW I I ALSO CANCER.

01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:45.768
SENATOR MITCHELL THANK YOU --

01:01:45.835 --> 01:01:47.503
THE DEBATE I HAVE A DEEP AND

01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:49.205
PROFOUND RESPECT FOR YOU YOU

01:01:49.272 --> 01:01:51.574
KNOW THAT AND I SHARE YOUR

01:01:51.641 --> 01:01:53.142
PASSION I HAVE SEEN.

01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:54.744
THE DOCUMENTARIES.

01:01:54.811 --> 01:01:56.279
BUT WHAT CONCERNS ME IS THIS

01:01:56.345 --> 01:01:58.915
SOUNDS.

01:01:58.981 --> 01:02:00.850
EERILY SIMILAR TO THE DEBATE IN

01:02:00.917 --> 01:02:02.085
THESE HALLOWED HALLS THIRTY

01:02:02.151 --> 01:02:04.120
YEARS AGO.

01:02:04.187 --> 01:02:08.191
WITH AROUND CRACK COCAINE.

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:14.230
AND WE THOUGHT CALMED -- TO

01:02:14.297 --> 01:02:16.065
AARON EERILY SIMILAR BECAUSE THE

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:18.334
FOCUS THEN WAS ON THE CAR TALES

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:22.305
WE LOVE YOU THAT WORK GUARDED --

01:02:22.371 --> 01:02:24.640
AND IT BECAME A SLIPPERY SLOPE

01:02:24.707 --> 01:02:27.176
IN TERMS OF THE POLICIES THAT

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:28.978
THE OF MICHELLE AIM WITH THE

01:02:29.045 --> 01:02:30.446
CARTELS THAT WE'RE BRINGING IT

01:02:30.513 --> 01:02:31.914
INTO OUR CUT COUNTRY.

01:02:31.981 --> 01:02:33.015
AND WE KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:34.383
OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS IN

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:37.220
TERMS OF WHO ULTIMATELY ENDED UP

01:02:37.286 --> 01:02:41.190
SERVING -- MANY MANY YEARS

01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:42.291
LOCKED UP.

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:46.129
IT WAS NOT JUST THE CARTELS AND

01:02:46.195 --> 01:02:48.131
SO THAT'S WHAT I MEAN I DON'T

01:02:48.197 --> 01:02:50.199
WANT US TO GO TO ONCE AGAIN

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:53.102
WILLINGLY KNOWINGLY ENGAGE IN A

01:02:53.169 --> 01:02:54.871
SLIPPERY SLOPE PROCESS.

01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:56.739
OF POLICY MAKING.

01:02:56.806 --> 01:02:58.141
I HEAR YOU WHEN I GET IT AND IF

01:02:58.207 --> 01:03:00.576
I COULD BE CONVINCED THAT WE

01:03:00.643 --> 01:03:03.112
COULD CRAFT LEGISLATION IN SUCH

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:03.946
A WAY.

01:03:04.013 --> 01:03:05.982
THAT JUST THOSE WHO BRING IN HE

01:03:06.048 --> 01:03:07.850
LARGE AMOUNTS WOULD BE IMPACTED

01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:09.418
THAT IS NOT BEEN THE EXPERIENCE

01:03:09.485 --> 01:03:10.686
OF THIS BODY.

01:03:10.753 --> 01:03:13.022
AND WE CAN GO BACK AND DOCUMENT

01:03:13.089 --> 01:03:15.158
THAT IT IS NOT BEEN EXPERIENCE

01:03:15.224 --> 01:03:18.327
WE NOW HAVE FOUR HUNDRED SINCE

01:03:18.394 --> 01:03:19.462
ENHANCEMENT LAWS ON THE BOOKS.

01:03:19.529 --> 01:03:22.899
HAS THAT HELPED.

01:03:22.965 --> 01:03:24.634
I WOULD ARGUE NOT AND SO THAT'S

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:28.004
WHY CAN'T SUPPORTTHE BILL AND

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:29.071
AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO THINK IT'S

01:03:29.138 --> 01:03:30.606
NOT BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:03:30.673 --> 01:03:33.409
THE PROBLEM I DO -- BUT YOU KNOW

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:34.510
WHAT THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY

01:03:34.577 --> 01:03:35.745
DOING THE SAME THING AND

01:03:35.811 --> 01:03:37.246
EXPECTING A DIFFERENT OUTCOME.

01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:38.981
WE NEED TO COME UP WITH THE NEW

01:03:39.048 --> 01:03:40.816
OUTCOME THAT TO REAL THAT'S

01:03:40.883 --> 01:03:42.518
GROUNDED AND WHAT WE KNOW TO BE

01:03:42.585 --> 01:03:44.921
DIFFERENT TODAY BASED ON HAVING

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:46.355
MADE THESE POLICY DECISIONS

01:03:46.422 --> 01:03:47.790
THIRTY YEARS AGO.

01:03:47.857 --> 01:03:49.725
THAT THAT DID NOTHING BUT

01:03:49.792 --> 01:03:51.627
DECIMATE MAJOR COMMUNITIES

01:03:51.694 --> 01:03:53.596
ACROSS THE STATE AND DID NOT

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:55.932
INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY OR DEATH

01:03:55.998 --> 01:03:58.868
DECREASED ACCESS TO A DRUG WE'VE

01:03:58.935 --> 01:04:00.169
WE DIFFERENTIATE AT THE

01:04:00.236 --> 01:04:01.704
ENHANCEMENTS FOR ONE FORM OF THE

01:04:01.771 --> 01:04:03.072
DRUG OVER THE OTHER.

01:04:03.139 --> 01:04:06.776
AND THAT GOT US NO WHERE SO FOR

01:04:06.842 --> 01:04:09.579
THOSE REASONS I CAN'T SUPPORT

01:04:09.645 --> 01:04:09.879
[inaudible]

01:04:09.946 --> 01:04:12.582

TO SUPPORT OF ENHANCEMENT FOR

01:04:29.298 --> 01:04:30.666
REASONS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN

01:04:30.733 --> 01:04:33.002

ARE NOW BEING IMPACTED BY THIS

01:04:55.157 --> 01:04:57.260
EXTREMELY LETHAL DRUG WHICH IS

LEGAL IN VERY SMALL QUANTITIES --

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:03.199

STOP THE CARTELS WE WANT TO STOP

01:05:32.028 --> 01:05:33.062
THIS FROM COMING INTO OUR

COUNTRY [inaudible]

01:05:34.297 --> 01:05:35.564
BUT IF [inaudible]

01:05:35.631 --> 01:05:37.933
THE IF.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.936
ADDING PENALTIES DID THAT THEN

01:05:41.003 --> 01:05:42.171
WE WOULDN'T HAVE HERE ONE ON THE

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:43.939
STREET BECAUSE WE HAVE VERY

01:05:44.006 --> 01:05:46.075
SERIOUS PENALTIES FOR HEROIN.

01:05:46.142 --> 01:05:46.842

01:05:46.909 --> 01:05:47.476
WE HAVE HERE ONE ON STREET

01:05:47.543 --> 01:05:48.110
[inaudible]

01:05:48.177 --> 01:05:50.146
SO.

01:05:50.212 --> 01:05:51.947
WHERE I LANDED WAS THAT THIS

01:05:52.014 --> 01:05:54.383
WILL NOT ACHIEVE THE GOAL THAT

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:55.651
IS BEING SENT OUT?

01:05:55.718 --> 01:05:57.653
EVEN KNOWING.

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.555
HOW LEGAL AND HOW DANGEROUS THIS

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:01.090
DRUG IS AND HOW [inaudible]

01:06:01.157 --> 01:06:04.193
IT'S PREVALENCE IS INCREASING

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:04.493
[inaudible]

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:07.196
I'M.

01:06:07.263 --> 01:06:08.764
SO I THINK THAT SENATOR MITCHELL

01:06:08.831 --> 01:06:10.800
SUGGESTION.

01:06:10.866 --> 01:06:12.668
I IS PROBABLY GOOD ONE I'M NOT

01:06:12.735 --> 01:06:14.804
SURE WHAT THE STATE CAN DO TO

01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:16.739
TRY TO AFFECT THIS TYPE OF THREE

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:18.574
BUT IT IS WORTH IT FOR SOME OF

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:20.276
US TO SIT DOWN WITH EXPERTS AND

01:06:20.343 --> 01:06:23.179
THINK ABOUT IT -- I WOULD NOTE

01:06:23.245 --> 01:06:23.813
THAT.

01:06:23.879 --> 01:06:24.980
KIND OF QUANTITIES THAT YOU HAVE

01:06:25.047 --> 01:06:28.484
LISTED IN THE BILL ARE ALREADY --

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:30.152
HAVE CERES PENALTIES UNDER

01:06:30.219 --> 01:06:33.022
FEDERAL AND USUALLY IN THIS TYPE

01:06:33.089 --> 01:06:35.057
OF TRADE WHICH GOES BEYOND STATE

01:06:35.124 --> 01:06:36.992
BORDERS THE FEDS DO STEP IN --

01:06:37.059 --> 01:06:39.428
SO AT LEAST I FEEL THAT IN MY

01:06:39.495 --> 01:06:40.930
NOT SUPPORTING THIS TODAY IT'S

01:06:40.996 --> 01:06:43.899
NOT LIKE I'M COMPLETELY IGNORING

01:06:43.966 --> 01:06:46.202
THERE IS FEDERAL STATUTE -- SO

01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:48.971
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST IS

01:06:49.038 --> 01:06:50.139
THAT IF THE BILL DOES NOT PASS

01:06:50.206 --> 01:06:50.973
TODAY WE GRANT YOU

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.708
RECONSIDERATION AND IF YOU WANT

01:06:52.775 --> 01:06:56.812

01:06:56.879 --> 01:06:58.848
STUDY OR EITHER IF YOU WANT TO

01:06:58.914 --> 01:07:00.249
BRING US BACK SOMETHING OR IF

01:07:00.316 --> 01:07:01.183
YOU JUST WANT.

01:07:02.017 --> 01:07:03.519
TO AGREED THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:07:03.586 --> 01:07:06.455
CONVENE SOMETHING EITHER WAY --

01:07:06.522 --> 01:07:08.224
BUT RIGHT NOW.

I JUST WANNA MAKE A COMMENT I AM

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:20.136
GOING TO BE SUPPORT YOUR BILL.

01:07:20.202 --> 01:07:24.340
I I HAVE NO SYMPATHY FOR PEOPLE

01:07:24.407 --> 01:07:27.576
OF PUSH DRUGS AND RUN OTHER

01:07:27.643 --> 01:07:30.379
PEOPLE'S LIVES IN CELL.

01:07:30.446 --> 01:07:32.114
I WISH THE SENTENCES WERE EVEN

01:07:32.181 --> 01:07:35.050
STRONGER SO -- I WILL.

01:07:35.117 --> 01:07:35.651
BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL THANK

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:38.821
YOU.

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:40.389
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THE ARE

01:07:40.456 --> 01:07:42.291
YOU I'M I DON'T COUNT VOTES IN

01:07:42.358 --> 01:07:43.993
UPPORT OF THE BILL YET SO.

01:07:44.059 --> 01:07:45.194
OF CERTAINLY ALL ASK FOR

01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:47.229
RECONSIDERATION IF IT DOES NOT

01:07:47.296 --> 01:07:49.131
PASS AND THEN TAKEN UNDER A

01:07:49.198 --> 01:07:51.567
CONSIDERATION WHAT THE WHAT YOU

01:07:51.634 --> 01:07:53.002
CHAIRMAN HAVE SUGGESTED I THINK

01:07:53.068 --> 01:07:54.804
THAT'S THE ROUTE WILL TAKE.

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:57.039
AND SEE IF WE CAN'T GET FROM

01:07:57.106 --> 01:07:58.207
CONVENE SOMETHING THAT GETS LEFT

01:07:58.274 --> 01:08:00.176
FILE AT LEAST FARTHER DOWN THE

01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:02.611
THE PATH TO DO -- IT FROM THIRTY

01:08:02.678 --> 01:08:05.047
INTERCEPTION OF THE DRUG COMING

01:08:05.114 --> 01:08:06.015
INTO THIS COUNTRY AND I THINK

01:08:06.081 --> 01:08:08.083
THAT THAT WILL CALIFORNIA'S LEAD

01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:11.887
ON SO MANY.

01:08:11.954 --> 01:08:14.056
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IT IS A

THAT'S THE FEELING OF BRAIN

01:15:43.405 --> 01:15:45.908
CELLS SUFFOCATING AND DYING.

01:15:45.974 --> 01:15:47.142
WHEN A PERSON INHALES NITROUS

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:48.710

01:15:50.145 --> 01:15:51.480
THIS MEANS THERE'S A VERY REAL

01:15:51.546 --> 01:15:53.782
CHANCE HE COULD DIE DURING HIS

COMMITTED TO A LIFE OF SOBRIETY.

01:16:29.584 --> 01:16:31.520
THE REALITY IS THAT ANY DAY OR

AND SEEING FIRSTHAND MY OWN BODY

01:18:01.843 --> 01:18:03.745
THE NEUROTOXIC EFFECTS IT HAS.

01:18:03.812 --> 01:18:05.013
A FEW YEARS AGO I STARTED DOWN

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:06.648
MY PATH WITH NITROUS STARTED

01:18:06.715 --> 01:18:08.050

TWO HUNDRED CANISTERS PER DAY.

01:18:14.589 --> 01:18:15.991
I DIDN'T REALIZE THE DANGER

01:18:16.058 --> 01:18:18.894
BECAUSE I KNOW THE DENTIST USES.

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:20.128
AND IF THE DENTISTS ARE ABLE TO

01:18:20.195 --> 01:18:20.729
USE THAT THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY

01:18:20.796 --> 01:18:22.097
DANGEROUS RIGHT.

PERMANENT DAMAGE FROM NITROUS.

01:18:30.772 --> 01:18:32.107

01:22:08.256 --> 01:22:10.425
MASKED.

01:22:10.492 --> 01:22:12.727
NOW THERE THERE ARE.

01:22:12.794 --> 01:22:15.030
TWO PROTEST OR MAKE STATEMENTS

01:22:15.096 --> 01:22:15.330
[inaudible]

01:22:15.397 --> 01:22:17.966
WHATEVER.

01:22:18.033 --> 01:22:20.101
THAT IN CASES THESE.

01:22:20.168 --> 01:22:22.304
VISIT SEVEN VERY DESTRUCTIVE

01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:23.138
[inaudible]

01:22:23.204 --> 01:22:24.939
OF PROPERTY.

LIVE IN VIOLENT ACTS.

01:22:27.542 --> 01:22:29.010
AND WITHOUT QUESTION THEY HAVE

01:22:29.077 --> 01:22:31.046
INTERFERED WITH THE EDUCATIONAL

01:22:31.112 --> 01:22:32.013
PURPOSES.

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:36.918
OF THE INSTITUTION.

01:22:36.985 --> 01:22:39.187
AND THE INTIMIDATING ASPECT OF

01:22:39.254 --> 01:22:41.923
THIS.

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:46.027
IS THE MASK.

01:22:46.094 --> 01:22:47.362
MASK SHOULD HOLLOW WE MAY BE

01:22:47.429 --> 01:22:48.997
YEARS UP AND WERE USED.

01:22:49.064 --> 01:22:51.132
TO BUT NORMALLY WHEN SOMEONE IS

01:22:51.199 --> 01:22:52.100
TRYING.

01:22:52.167 --> 01:22:55.370
TO HIDE THEIR IDENTITY.

01:22:55.437 --> 01:22:57.605
IT'S FOR SOME PARTICULAR REASON.

01:22:57.672 --> 01:23:00.342
THAT THEY ARE AFRAID OF AND IN

01:23:00.408 --> 01:23:02.677
THIS PARTICULAR CASE.

01:23:02.744 --> 01:23:03.478
THEY'RE AFRAID OF BEING A

01:23:03.545 --> 01:23:05.246
DOLLARS FOR WHO THEY ARE ON THIS

01:23:05.313 --> 01:23:07.015
CAMPUS DISRUPTING.

01:23:07.082 --> 01:23:10.218
THE CAMPUS ENVIRONMENT.

01:23:10.285 --> 01:23:13.154
SO WHAT THIS BILL SIMPLY DOES.

01:23:13.221 --> 01:23:16.458
THAT ALLOWS LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:23:16.524 --> 01:23:18.727
BUILDING ON EXISTING LAW. TO

01:23:18.793 --> 01:23:21.529
STOP ANY INDIVIDUAL.

01:23:21.596 --> 01:23:22.664
IF THE OFFICER HAS A REASONABLE

01:23:22.731 --> 01:23:25.100
SUSPICON THAT THIS INDIVIDUALS

01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:25.400

01:23:25.467 --> 01:23:26.368
COULD BE.

01:23:26.434 --> 01:23:28.503
OR IS INTENDING TO BE INVOLVED.

01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:32.107
IN A CRIME.

01:23:32.173 --> 01:23:32.774
AND THEY SIMPLY HAVE.

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:33.575
WOULD.

01:23:33.641 --> 01:23:35.377
TELL THAT INDIVIDUAL. TO REMOVE

01:23:35.443 --> 01:23:38.046
THE MASK.

01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:40.181
AND TO DISCLOSE THEIR IDENTITY.

01:23:40.248 --> 01:23:42.217
BY SO DOING.

01:23:42.283 --> 01:23:46.121
IT IS A VERY SIMPLE BILL.

01:23:46.187 --> 01:23:48.656
AND IT WOULD PRESERVE I THINK.

01:23:48.723 --> 01:23:49.791
A MUCH SAFER ENVIRONMENT WITHIN

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:53.161
OUR CAMPUSES.

01:23:53.228 --> 01:23:55.196

01:24:02.537 --> 01:24:05.473
ARE NOT THERE FOR THE PURPOSE.

01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:06.841
AGAIN A BIT TO BILL AND AN

01:24:06.908 --> 01:24:09.077
EXISTING LAW.

01:24:09.144 --> 01:24:11.079
AND THE ESSENCE OF IT IS THE

01:24:11.146 --> 01:24:12.747

LAWFUL CAMPUS PROTESTS.

01:26:21.809 --> 01:26:22.777
PERMITTING LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:26:49.137 --> 01:26:51.205
IT IS ALSO UNCLEAR WHETHER THE

STANDARD OF REASONABLE SUSPICION

01:26:52.941 --> 01:26:55.076

WHATEVER WOULD HAPPEN AFTER THAT

01:29:20.955 --> 01:29:22.323
THAT WOULD BE DEPENDING ON

01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:24.092
WHATEVER THE CIRCUMSTANCES WAS

01:29:24.158 --> 01:29:26.394
DISCLOSED TO THE INDIVIDUAL IT

01:29:26.461 --> 01:29:28.296

DETERMINED BY THE BEHAVIOR OF

01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:37.138
BUT AGAIN.

01:29:37.205 --> 01:29:40.007
IT IS NOT OUR INTENT FOR SOMEONE

01:29:57.024 --> 01:29:58.526
I WOULD EXPECT THAT OUR LAW

ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS WOULD

01:29:59.794 --> 01:30:02.764

I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL AYE

01:30:41.769 --> 01:30:43.404
AYE I THINK SOMETHING DISTURBING

01:30:43.471 --> 01:30:45.072
EVEN HISTORICALLY OF OF WEARING

01:30:45.139 --> 01:30:46.707

01:30:46.774 --> 01:30:48.109
INAPPROPRIATE TIMES THAT

01:30:48.176 --> 01:30:50.144
FUNCTIONS FIGHT.

01:30:50.211 --> 01:30:51.312

BILL TODAY JUST AS I DID NOT IN

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:03.457
THE LAST YEAR -- AND MY REASON

01:31:03.524 --> 01:31:05.359
IS DUE TO THE NOTE THE STATE IN

01:31:05.426 --> 01:31:07.862
THE ANALYSIS THAT IT IS ALREADY

01:31:07.929 --> 01:31:09.497
A MISDEMEANOR IF YOU ARE WEARING.

01:31:09.564 --> 01:31:12.099
A MASK AND YOU ARE AND THE LAW

01:31:12.166 --> 01:31:17.071
ENFORCEMENT -- BELIEVES THAT YOU

01:31:17.138 --> 01:31:18.773

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:20.641
THEN THEY CAN.

01:31:20.708 --> 01:31:22.143
BOTH DEMAND YOUR REMOVAL OF THE

01:31:22.210 --> 01:31:24.078
MASK AND CHARGED WITH A

01:31:24.145 --> 01:31:26.214
MISDEMEANOR JUST FOR WEARING THE

01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:27.181
MASK.

01:31:27.248 --> 01:31:28.816
AND IT SEEMS TO ME AND THAT

01:31:28.883 --> 01:31:30.985
WORKS ON CAMPUSES OR IN PUBLIC

01:31:31.052 --> 01:31:32.920

01:31:34.655 --> 01:31:35.756
CAMPUSES.

01:31:35.823 --> 01:31:38.259
SO I DON'T SEE THE NEED TO ADD

01:31:38.326 --> 01:31:41.229
AN ADDITIONAL LAW -- SO I WILL

01:31:41.295 --> 01:31:44.265

DOING SO REALLY GOES BACK TO

01:53:38.444 --> 01:53:39.512
KIND OF THE THE REFERENCE TO THE

01:53:39.579 --> 01:53:40.947
SLIDING SCALE THAT WAS PUT INTO

01:53:41.014 --> 01:53:43.550
A FACT -- IN THE NINETIES BUT

01:53:43.616 --> 01:53:44.584
WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW WAS

01:53:44.651 --> 01:53:45.852
THAT THAT SLIDING SCALE WAS

01:53:45.919 --> 01:53:48.221
REALLY -- PUT INTO PLACE AT A

01:53:48.288 --> 01:53:50.523
TIME WHEN THE DJJ POPULATION WAS

01:53:50.590 --> 01:53:53.226
VERY VERY HIGH -- AND AND THERE

01:53:53.293 --> 01:53:56.062
WAS A LARGE POPULATION OF KIND

01:53:56.129 --> 01:53:58.164
OF LOWER RISK OFFENDERS THAT --

01:53:58.231 --> 01:53:59.165
THE STATE WAS TRYING TO

01:53:59.232 --> 01:54:00.767
INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES TO KEEP

01:54:00.833 --> 01:54:04.103

01:54:07.507 --> 01:54:09.442
WHICH PROBATION WAS A PARTNER OF

01:54:09.509 --> 01:54:11.110
AND THAT ENDED COMMITMENTS OF

01:54:11.177 --> 01:54:12.512
NONVIOLENT YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS TO

01:54:12.579 --> 01:54:14.314
DJJ SO THAT REALLY WAS THE

01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:17.250
CATALYST -- FOR KEEPING THOSE

01:54:17.317 --> 01:54:19.185
LOWER RISK -- YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS

01:54:19.252 --> 01:54:21.554
OUT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND SO NOW --

01:54:21.621 --> 01:54:23.289
REINSTITUTING KIND OF THIS

01:54:23.356 --> 01:54:26.125
SLIDING SCALE -- AT A TIME WHEN

01:54:26.192 --> 01:54:27.460
THE SYSTEM LOOKS MUCH DIFFERENT

01:54:27.527 --> 01:54:29.696

01:54:38.738 --> 01:54:40.873

TIME.

01:55:37.463 --> 01:55:39.032
COUNTY PROBATION HAS WORKED HARD

01:55:39.098 --> 01:55:40.266
TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF YOUTH IN

YOU ROUGHLY AND DJJ.

01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:10.096
MEANING THAT LESS THAN 3% OF

AND THE COMMUNITY.

01:56:20.006 --> 01:56:22.175
UNFORTUNATELY OUR CONCERN IS

01:56:22.241 --> 01:56:24.110
THAT THIS LEGISLATION COULD

01:56:24.177 --> 01:56:26.813
IMPACT THAT PROGRAMMING.

01:56:26.879 --> 01:56:28.081
THE VAST MAJORITY THAT IS THE

01:56:28.147 --> 01:56:29.482
VAST MAJORITY OF YOUTH THAT ARE

01:56:29.549 --> 01:56:31.484
BEING SENT TO DJJ OUR YOUTH THAT

01:56:31.551 --> 01:56:33.419

01:56:33.486 --> 01:56:34.153
THE COUNTY OF NOT ABLE TO

01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:35.621
PROVIDE THEM WITH THE RESOURCES

01:56:35.688 --> 01:56:37.156
THAT THEY NEED.

01:56:37.223 --> 01:56:37.890
LIKE HIGHLY SPECIALIZED

01:56:37.957 --> 01:56:39.559
PROGRAMMING SUCH AS YOU THROUGH

01:56:39.625 --> 01:56:42.128
COMMITTED SEX OFFENSES AND NEED

01:56:42.195 --> 01:56:42.995
THE STATE'S SEX OFFENDER

01:56:43.062 --> 01:56:44.230
TREATMENT PROGRAM.

01:56:44.297 --> 01:56:46.032
AND IF APPROPRIATE PROGRAMMING

01:56:46.099 --> 01:56:48.101
IS NOT AVAILABLE THE COURT WHO

01:56:48.167 --> 01:56:48.968
ACTUALLY MAKES THE ULTIMATE

01:56:49.035 --> 01:56:50.536
DECISION AS TO WHETHER TO SEND A

01:56:50.603 --> 01:56:52.839
YOUTH DJJ WILL HAVE TO COMMIT

01:56:52.905 --> 01:56:54.607
THAT YOU.

01:56:54.674 --> 01:56:56.142
SO YOUTH WILL CONTINUE TO BE

01:56:56.209 --> 01:56:58.411
COMMITTED TO DJJ AND COUNTIES

01:56:58.478 --> 01:57:00.213

TOWARDS OUR COMMITMENT.

01:57:02.148 --> 01:57:03.049
IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THIS

01:57:03.116 --> 01:57:04.350
LEGISLATION WILL CREATE AN

01:57:04.417 --> 01:57:05.785
INCENTIVE TO HOUSE MORE USED

01:57:05.852 --> 01:57:06.486
LOCALLY.

01:57:06.552 --> 01:57:08.187
AND THAT IT WILL INSTEAD PLACE A

01:57:08.254 --> 01:57:09.322
FINANCIAL BURDEN ON THE COUNTIES

01:57:09.389 --> 01:57:10.990
THEREBY DIMINISHING PROBATION

INTERESTING ABOUT THIS RIGHT AT

01:58:25.431 --> 01:58:28.034
GIVEN THEIR?

01:58:28.100 --> 01:58:30.736
SO ARE -- THE AUTHOR HAS

01:58:30.803 --> 01:58:32.472
PROVIDED US A CHART WHICH SHOWS

01:58:32.538 --> 01:58:34.373
US HOW MUCH ROOM IS IN OUR

01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:37.109
COUNTY FACILITIES NOW WE KNOW

01:58:37.176 --> 01:58:37.310
THAT.

01:58:37.376 --> 01:58:39.645
OUR DJ JAY POPULATION ALONE HAS

01:58:39.712 --> 01:58:42.248
GREATLY DECREASED. FOR MANY

01:58:42.315 --> 01:58:44.350
REASONS THE BEST OF WHICH IS

01:58:44.417 --> 01:58:46.519
THAT ACTUAL YOUTH CRIME IS

01:58:46.586 --> 01:58:49.989
SIGNIFICANTLY DOWN AND HAS BEEN

01:58:50.056 --> 01:58:51.958
FOR TWENTY YEARS. FOR TWENTY

01:58:52.024 --> 01:58:53.993
YEARS YOUTH SERIES YOUTH CRIME

01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:55.294
IS DROP DROP DROP DROP.

01:58:55.361 --> 01:58:59.131
AND SORE DJJ POPULATION IS DOWN

01:58:59.198 --> 01:59:01.734
THERE ALSO OTHER ON POLICIES

01:59:01.801 --> 01:59:03.569
THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S ENACTED

01:59:03.636 --> 01:59:05.404
THAT IS REDUCE THAT POPULATION

01:59:05.471 --> 01:59:06.239
BUT OUR POPULATION IN THE

01:59:06.305 --> 01:59:08.241
COUNTIES IS SIGNIFICANTLY DOWN

01:59:08.307 --> 01:59:09.242
TO THE POINT.

01:59:09.308 --> 01:59:11.210
WHERE IF YOU LOOK AT THIS CHART

01:59:11.277 --> 01:59:13.112
YOU'LL SEE THERE ARE MANY

01:59:13.179 --> 01:59:14.313
CONTIES FOR HOLDING ONLY FIVE

01:59:14.380 --> 01:59:15.648
YOU [inaudible]

01:59:15.715 --> 01:59:16.015
NOW [inaudible]

01:59:16.082 --> 01:59:17.583
IRONICALLY.

01:59:17.650 --> 01:59:19.552
A RECENT OUR INVESTIGATIVE

01:59:19.619 --> 01:59:21.554
REPORT BY THE SAN FRANCISCO

01:59:21.621 --> 01:59:23.556
CHRONICLE SHOW THAT WE HAVE

01:59:23.623 --> 01:59:27.226
COUNTIES THAT ARE SPENDING.

01:59:27.293 --> 01:59:28.060
IT DID. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY K. AND

01:59:28.127 --> 01:59:31.898
A BUFF ALAMEDA COUNTY FOUR

01:59:31.964 --> 01:59:32.532
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ANNUALLY

01:59:32.598 --> 01:59:33.633
ON THE HOLDING OF USE.

01:59:33.699 --> 01:59:34.667
US IN A CLEAR COUNTY THE

01:59:34.734 --> 01:59:37.036
DOCTOR'S OWN COUNTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:59:37.103 --> 01:59:39.238
AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND A YEAR

01:59:39.305 --> 01:59:40.239
HOLDING YOUTH.

01:59:40.306 --> 01:59:43.242
SO THERE ARE VERY FEW COUNTIES

01:59:43.309 --> 01:59:45.611
FOR WHOM THAT THE COST TO THEM

01:59:45.678 --> 01:59:46.846
WOULD BE LESS.

01:59:46.913 --> 01:59:49.382
THAN THIS COST THAT WE WOULD NOW

01:59:49.448 --> 01:59:52.919
BE RACING.

01:59:52.985 --> 01:59:55.254
SO IT'S I GUESS WHAT I'M REYES

01:59:55.321 --> 01:59:55.988
IS I'M NOT SURE IF IT WILL

01:59:56.055 --> 01:59:56.589
CREATE THE FISCAL INCENTIVES

01:59:56.656 --> 01:59:58.257
THAT WE QUITE HOPE.

01:59:58.324 --> 02:00:00.192
BUT I CERTAINLY THINK IT IS

02:00:00.259 --> 02:00:02.194
LEGITIMATE TO DO SO BECAUSE

02:00:02.261 --> 02:00:03.930
CERTAINLY WE WOULDN'T WANT TO BE

02:00:03.996 --> 02:00:05.231
IN THE SITUATION WHERE WE WERE.

02:00:05.298 --> 02:00:07.266
AS WE HAVE.

02:00:07.333 --> 02:00:09.435
ONLY BE EXPECTING A TWENTY FOUR

02:00:09.502 --> 02:00:10.369
THOUSAND BECAUSE THEN THAT WOULD

02:00:10.436 --> 02:00:12.204
REALLY HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT

02:00:12.271 --> 02:00:14.273
MOTIVATION TO SEND MORE USED TO

02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:16.676
DJJ GIVEN THE COST.

02:00:16.742 --> 02:00:18.077
THAT OUR WN COUNTIES ARE

02:00:18.144 --> 02:00:19.345
SPENDING.

02:00:19.412 --> 02:00:21.213
BUT I THINK WHAT IT RAISES IS

02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:22.214
THAT [inaudible]

02:00:22.281 --> 02:00:24.016
OBVIOUSLY.

02:00:24.083 --> 02:00:29.622
WE ARE WE NO -- THAT.

02:00:29.689 --> 02:00:31.490
BY REMOVING YOUTHS FROM

02:00:31.557 --> 02:00:32.792
PROXIMITY TO THEIR COMMUNITIES

02:00:32.858 --> 02:00:34.860
AND THEIR FAMILIES.

02:00:34.927 --> 02:00:37.163
WE DON'T IMPROVE OUTCOMES BUT

02:00:37.229 --> 02:00:37.763
WHAT.

02:00:37.830 --> 02:00:39.999
WE SEE NOW IS THAT ARE COUNTY

02:00:40.066 --> 02:00:41.233
FACILITIES EVEN ARE NOT

02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:44.203
NECESSARILY GIVING US GREAT OUT

02:00:44.270 --> 02:00:45.137
COMES.

02:00:45.204 --> 02:00:46.606
AND THAT IT MAY BE JUST THE

02:00:46.672 --> 02:00:48.874
ENTIRE.

02:00:48.941 --> 02:00:52.478
HOLDING OF YOUTH IN A ARE CALLED

02:00:52.545 --> 02:00:53.779
A PUNITIVE SETTING.

02:00:53.846 --> 02:00:55.681
DOES NOT PROVIDE.

02:00:55.748 --> 02:00:58.551
THE TYPE OF WORK.

02:00:58.618 --> 02:01:03.055
THAT THE YOUTH NEED TO BE ABLE.

02:01:03.122 --> 02:01:04.690
TO TO ADDRESS WHATEVER ISSUES

02:01:04.757 --> 02:01:07.093
CAUSE THEM TO TO ENGAGE IN THE

02:01:07.159 --> 02:01:09.295
BEHAVIOR THEY ENGAGED WHICH THEN

02:01:09.362 --> 02:01:10.630
COULD.

02:01:10.696 --> 02:01:12.164
LEAD US TO A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE

02:01:12.231 --> 02:01:13.466
WE POTENTIALLY WOULD HAVE USED

02:01:13.532 --> 02:01:14.800
THAT ARE NOT.

02:01:14.867 --> 02:01:18.971
ON COMMITTING THOSE ACTS AND THE

02:01:19.038 --> 02:01:20.940
THE DATA WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE

02:01:21.007 --> 02:01:23.175
THAT JUST BY VIRTUE OF BEING

02:01:23.242 --> 02:01:25.044
HELD EVEN IN A COUNTY FACILITY.

02:01:25.111 --> 02:01:26.946
YOUR LIKELIHOOD TO GO INTO AN

02:01:27.013 --> 02:01:28.314
ADULT FACILITY.

02:01:28.381 --> 02:01:30.483
INCREASES ITS I FORGET THE EXACT

02:01:30.549 --> 02:01:32.218
PERCENT BUT IT'S IN THE THIRTY

02:01:32.284 --> 02:01:33.986
YEAR PERCENT OR WATER SO SO

02:01:34.053 --> 02:01:35.054
ANYWAY.

02:01:35.121 --> 02:01:37.023
SO I THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT

02:01:37.089 --> 02:01:39.091
DIRECTION TO GO BUT I THINK THAT

02:01:39.158 --> 02:01:42.094
WE AS A LEGISLATURE HAVE TO LOOK

02:01:42.161 --> 02:01:44.497
AT THIS WHOLE QUESTION.

02:01:44.563 --> 02:01:46.032
OF HOW WE DEAL WITH YOUTH AND

02:01:46.098 --> 02:01:47.933
YOUTH OFFENDERS -- BOTH DUE TO

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.803
THE COST IN THE COUNTIES AND DUE

02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:53.105
TO THE WE'RE NOT ACHIEVING NOW

02:01:53.172 --> 02:01:55.808
COMES WE HAD WE HAD INTENDED AND

02:01:55.875 --> 02:01:56.876
I ARE.

02:01:56.942 --> 02:01:58.844
IT IS REMINISCENT OF SENATOR

02:01:58.911 --> 02:02:01.213
MITCHELL'S COMMENTS REGARDING

02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:03.182
OUR THINKING THAT CERTAIN OF OUR

02:02:03.249 --> 02:02:06.952
SENSES WOULD CREATE A A

02:02:07.019 --> 02:02:09.822
INCENTIVE OR A MESSAGE THAT.

02:02:09.889 --> 02:02:12.191
YOU KNOW -- TO SUPPRESS THAT

02:02:12.258 --> 02:02:14.860
ACTIVITY WHICH THEY HAVE NOT.

02:02:14.927 --> 02:02:16.362
IN SO SIMILARLY I THINK IT IS

02:02:16.429 --> 02:02:18.097
VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO LOOK AT

02:02:18.164 --> 02:02:19.565
WHETHER WE ARE ACHIEVING WHAT WE

02:02:19.632 --> 02:02:21.400
INTENDED TO WITH THE WAY THAT

02:02:21.467 --> 02:02:23.002
WE'VE EVEN DESIGNED.

02:02:23.069 --> 02:02:25.705

YOUTH CRIME IS DROPPED -- BUT

02:02:31.911 --> 02:02:33.879
WITHOUT SAID AS I INDICATED I

02:02:33.946 --> 02:02:34.747

FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE REALLY ISN'T

ATTORNEY GENERAL'S POSITION I I

02:21:22.173 --> 02:21:24.576

ALL RIGHT -- I WILL NOW ADD MY A

02:21:35.119 --> 02:21:38.122
SOME COMMENTS -- FOURTEEN TWENTY

02:21:38.189 --> 02:21:39.791
ONE WAS ONLY A MODEST IT MOSTLY.

02:21:39.858 --> 02:21:41.826
IT DID.

02:21:41.893 --> 02:21:43.027
HAVE A MEMBER TO PROBAR BUT ITS

02:21:43.094 --> 02:21:44.095
PRIMARY MEMBERS FOR THE PUBLIC

02:21:44.162 --> 02:21:48.199
RECORDS ACT -- I APPRECIATE I

02:21:48.266 --> 02:21:49.467
DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THE

02:21:49.534 --> 02:21:51.936
CATEGORY OF EMPLOYEES THAT WOULD%

02:21:52.003 --> 02:21:53.972
LIKE THAT FEEL THAT THIS THEIR

02:21:54.038 --> 02:21:55.106
EXCLUSION.

02:21:55.173 --> 02:21:57.609
HAS TREATED THEM UNFAIRLY AND AS

02:21:57.675 --> 02:22:04.115
A PERSON WHO -- ORGANIZE THE A

02:22:04.182 --> 02:22:06.217
UNION -- BECAUSE I FELT THAT THE

02:22:06.284 --> 02:22:08.052
CATEGORY AT THAT I WORKED IN AT

02:22:08.119 --> 02:22:09.921
THAT TIME WAS NOT BEING TREATED

02:22:09.988 --> 02:22:11.489
FAIRLY AND WE SUCCEEDED SO I

02:22:11.556 --> 02:22:13.625
TOTALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

02:22:13.691 --> 02:22:15.760
MY DIFFICULTY RIGHT NOW.

02:22:15.827 --> 02:22:16.761
I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THIS

02:22:16.828 --> 02:22:18.029
BILL.

02:22:18.096 --> 02:22:20.298
IS THAT IN IN THIS IN GIVEN THE

02:22:20.365 --> 02:22:22.233
COMMENTS THAT SENATOR WIENER

02:22:22.300 --> 02:22:24.636
MADE IT SORT OF YOU KNOW IT'S AN

02:22:24.702 --> 02:22:26.404
ONE COULD SAY WELL LOOK I SHOULD

02:22:26.471 --> 02:22:27.272
[inaudible]

02:22:27.338 --> 02:22:28.840
JUST ALLOW.

02:22:28.907 --> 02:22:32.110
THOSE OFFICERS WHO HAVE -- WOULD

02:22:32.176 --> 02:22:35.847
NORMALLY BE IN THIS -- GIVEN OUR

02:22:35.914 --> 02:22:38.950
PAST ACTIONS. TO YOU KNOW HAVE

02:22:39.017 --> 02:22:41.686
THE SAME THE SAME RIGHTS.

02:22:41.753 --> 02:22:44.489
MY PROBLEM THOUGH IS IF BY COULD

02:22:44.555 --> 02:22:47.158
REDO -- POLE BARN OF COURSE ANY

02:22:47.225 --> 02:22:49.093
OF US COULD INTRODUCE IT BUT

02:22:49.160 --> 02:22:52.497
IT'S THE DIFFICULT -- IT'S A

02:22:52.563 --> 02:22:53.965
DIFFICULT BILL TO OPEN UP BUT I

02:22:54.032 --> 02:22:56.200
FEEL THAT.

02:22:56.267 --> 02:22:58.603
IN THE STATE'S.

02:22:58.670 --> 02:23:00.738
USE OF IT TOWARDS OUR OFFICERS

02:23:00.805 --> 02:23:03.141
WERE IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES

02:23:03.207 --> 02:23:05.343
THAT THERE ARE TWO PROVISIONS IN

02:23:05.410 --> 02:23:07.011
KHOBAR THAT ARE PROBLEMATIC.

02:23:07.078 --> 02:23:10.148
THAT I THINK PERHAPS ONE WAS NOT

02:23:10.214 --> 02:23:14.118
FULLY DEBATED OR UNDERSTOOD.

02:23:14.185 --> 02:23:16.888
WHEN IT WAS EXTENDED TO PEOPLE

02:23:16.955 --> 02:23:17.655
WHO ARE IN?

02:23:17.722 --> 02:23:18.856
WHO ARE CUSTODIAL OFFICERS AND

02:23:18.923 --> 02:23:22.226
THOSE TWO ARE THE ISSUES AROUND?

02:23:22.293 --> 02:23:25.530
THE PROHIBITION OF SEARCHING OF

02:23:25.596 --> 02:23:26.931
LOCKERS AND PERSONAL.

02:23:26.998 --> 02:23:28.733
I'M JUST BECAUSE OF THE NATURE

02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:30.101
OF WHEN YOU'RE A CUSTODIAL

02:23:30.168 --> 02:23:32.904
OFFICER IN THE IN.

02:23:32.971 --> 02:23:34.305
YOU KNOW NOT MAKING ANY KIND OF

02:23:34.372 --> 02:23:36.074
BLANKET STATEMENT THE CAN STUDIO

02:23:36.140 --> 02:23:37.175
OFFICERS ARE THE SOURCE OF

02:23:37.241 --> 02:23:40.011
CONTRABAND IN -- FACILITIES BUT

02:23:40.078 --> 02:23:42.080
SINCE THAT IS ALWAYS A

02:23:42.146 --> 02:23:44.515
POSSIBILITY WITHOUT THAT ABILITY

02:23:44.582 --> 02:23:47.318
I THINK IT'S IT'S DIFFERENT.

02:23:47.385 --> 02:23:48.219
THEN SOME OF OUR OTHER

02:23:48.286 --> 02:23:49.587
CATEGORIES OF OFFICERS WHO ARE

02:23:49.654 --> 02:23:51.255
UNDER PROBAR I THINK

02:23:51.322 --> 02:23:53.257
ADDITIONALLY.

02:23:53.324 --> 02:23:54.993
THE PROHIBITION OF THE USE OF A

02:23:55.059 --> 02:23:57.695
POLYGRAPH OR LIE DETECTOR AND

02:23:57.762 --> 02:24:00.264
THE RULES AROUND INTERROGATION.

02:24:00.331 --> 02:24:01.099
THAT [inaudible]

02:24:01.165 --> 02:24:03.034
WHILE.

02:24:03.101 --> 02:24:04.369
MARCUS THIRTY OFFICERS ARE

02:24:04.435 --> 02:24:06.070
ENGAGED IN A TEN CARE CATION

02:24:06.137 --> 02:24:08.773
THAT MUCH THE FEW TIMES THEY ARE.

02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:10.041
IN OTHER WORDS IT'S JUST THERE A

02:24:10.108 --> 02:24:12.410
DIFFERENT CATEGORY.

02:24:12.477 --> 02:24:15.213
OF THEIR THEIR ROLES ARE

02:24:15.279 --> 02:24:16.914
DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF OUR OTHER

02:24:16.981 --> 02:24:19.150
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.

02:24:19.217 --> 02:24:21.619
SO IF I HAD THE WHOLE ISSUE OF

02:24:21.686 --> 02:24:23.488
ALLOWING ANY CUSTODIAL OFFICERS

02:24:23.554 --> 02:24:24.555
IN PROBAR AS CURRENTLY

02:24:24.622 --> 02:24:26.624
CONSTRUCTED I PROBABLY WOULDN'T

02:24:26.691 --> 02:24:28.159
BE COMFORTABLE.

02:24:28.226 --> 02:24:31.996
SO. FOR TODAY EVEN THOUGH I AND

02:24:32.063 --> 02:24:32.630
I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THIS

02:24:32.697 --> 02:24:35.099
AS I INDICATED AND I APPRECIATE

02:24:35.166 --> 02:24:36.100
THAT IT'S NOT.

02:24:36.167 --> 02:24:38.970
FAIR IN FACT TO HAVE.

02:24:39.037 --> 02:24:40.405
OFFICERS.

02:24:40.471 --> 02:24:42.040
AND DO THE SAME JOB IN EFFECT TO

02:24:42.106 --> 02:24:43.141
BE UNDER IT AND THEN OTHER

02:24:43.207 --> 02:24:46.844
OFFICERS NOT -- I AM I AM GOING

02:24:46.911 --> 02:24:49.280
TO STAY OFF THE BILL TODAY.

02:24:49.347 --> 02:24:51.816
SO -- I WANTED TO EXPLAIN WHERE

02:24:51.883 --> 02:24:57.088
AND AND I WAS ON GRAPPLING WITH

02:24:57.155 --> 02:24:59.157
IT LATE LAST NIGHT AGAIN THIS

02:24:59.223 --> 02:25:02.427
MORNING -- BUT THAT'S WHAT I

02:25:02.493 --> 02:25:03.361
PERSONALLY HAVE CONCLUDED.

02:25:03.428 --> 02:25:08.032
ON ANYWAY SO I'M NOT I WILL NOT

02:25:08.099 --> 02:25:08.599
BE SUPPORTING BUT I WILL BE

02:25:08.666 --> 02:25:09.100
VOTING NO.

02:25:09.167 --> 02:25:11.069
SO LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY

02:25:11.135 --> 02:25:13.237
OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS

02:25:13.304 --> 02:25:15.106
BEFORE ASK THE AUTHOR TO CLOSE.

02:25:15.173 --> 02:25:16.941
OKAY CENTER YES GIVEN THAT

02:25:17.008 --> 02:25:18.609
EVERYONE'S COMMENTING ON THIS

02:25:18.676 --> 02:25:19.710
WHY THEY'RE VOTING I FEEL

02:25:19.777 --> 02:25:21.212
COMPELLED TO SHARE I AM GOING TO

02:25:21.279 --> 02:25:23.181
VOTE FOR THIS -- THERE ARE

02:25:23.247 --> 02:25:24.982
QUESTIONS ABOUT POLL BAR I THINK

02:25:25.049 --> 02:25:27.085
MAYBE WE NEED TO REVISIT IT BUT

02:25:27.151 --> 02:25:29.053
I CANNOT SEE WHY WE WOULD.

02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:30.888
REQUIRE.

02:25:30.955 --> 02:25:32.323
MOST PEOPLE TO BE UNDER IT AND

02:25:32.390 --> 02:25:34.525
NOT OTHERS SO FOR THE PURPOSES

02:25:34.592 --> 02:25:35.993
OF UNIFORMITY.

02:25:36.060 --> 02:25:37.161
ON THE OTHER HAND I THINK WE

02:25:37.228 --> 02:25:39.230
COULD TAKE A SECOND LOOK AT PO

02:25:39.297 --> 02:25:40.865
BAR FOR SOME OF THE PROBLEMS

02:25:40.932 --> 02:25:41.933
THAT HAVE BEEN ARTICULATED BUT

02:25:41.999 --> 02:25:43.968
THE BILL AS I UNDERSTAND IT.

02:25:44.035 --> 02:25:45.937
IS JUST SIMPLY INCLUDING THIS

02:25:46.003 --> 02:25:48.239
GROUP UNDER THOSE SAME RULES AND

02:25:48.306 --> 02:25:50.074
REGULATIONS SO WITH THAT I WILL

02:25:50.141 --> 02:25:52.143
BE SUPPORTING THE BILL ALTHOUGH

02:25:52.210 --> 02:25:54.011
I DO HOPE THAT WE WILL REVISIT.

02:25:54.078 --> 02:25:55.246
SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE

02:25:55.313 --> 02:25:56.614
BEEN EXPRESSED ABOUT THE

02:25:56.681 --> 02:25:59.650
SUBSTANCE OF A BAR.

02:25:59.717 --> 02:26:00.952
A CENTER MITCHELL.

02:26:01.018 --> 02:26:02.353
I HAVE A QUESTION BECAUSE I I DO

02:26:02.420 --> 02:26:03.888
HAVE MAJOR CONCERNS ABOUT POOL

02:26:03.955 --> 02:26:06.090
BAR AND AND AND DO YOU THINK IT

02:26:06.157 --> 02:26:08.159
COMPLICATES OUR ABILITY TO EVER

02:26:08.226 --> 02:26:09.227
OPEN IT UP AND REYES SOME OF THE

02:26:09.293 --> 02:26:09.961
ISSUES YOU.

02:26:10.027 --> 02:26:13.297
YOU RAISED IF WE CONTINUE TO ADD

02:26:13.364 --> 02:26:14.799
CLASSES OF PEOPLE TO IT

02:26:14.866 --> 02:26:15.266
[inaudible]

02:26:15.333 --> 02:26:20.638
I'M. FOR ME IT WAS A INTERNAL

02:26:20.705 --> 02:26:22.540
CONSISTENCY SO THAT'S WHY I

02:26:22.607 --> 02:26:24.642
CONCLUDED THAT BUT CERTAINLY THE

02:26:24.709 --> 02:26:26.344
DIFFICULTY OF OPENING FOUR BAR

02:26:26.410 --> 02:26:29.080
UP REMAINS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER.

02:26:29.147 --> 02:26:31.182
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NONE OF

02:26:31.249 --> 02:26:34.152
PEOPLE YES WILL PULL THAT ALL

02:26:34.218 --> 02:26:34.452
RIGHT OKAY.

02:26:34.519 --> 02:26:35.319
I MEAN SENATOR JACKSON WAS

02:26:35.386 --> 02:26:36.587
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND I COULD

02:26:36.654 --> 02:26:40.491
HAVE SAID WHAT SHE JUST STATED

02:26:40.558 --> 02:26:42.093
JUST AS EASILY.

02:26:42.160 --> 02:26:42.894
SO I WANT I WANT THE

02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:44.228
COMMUNICATION WORKERS AND THE

02:26:44.295 --> 02:26:45.563
OFFICERS IN AFFECTED TO KNOW

02:26:45.630 --> 02:26:49.367
THAT FROM MY POINT OF VIEW I A

02:26:49.433 --> 02:26:51.102
YOU KNOW THIS IS A AT HOME I

02:26:51.169 --> 02:26:53.838
FEEL VERY CONFLICTED ABOUT IT --

02:26:53.905 --> 02:26:56.374
BUT JUST FOR MY OWN.

02:26:56.440 --> 02:26:57.275
BILL ANY FOR INTERNAL

02:26:57.341 --> 02:26:59.577
CONSISTENCY I WON'T BE BUT I

02:26:59.644 --> 02:27:01.212
CERTAINLY I COULD HAVE MADE.

02:27:01.279 --> 02:27:02.847
THE SAME ARGUMENT THAT CENTER

02:27:02.914 --> 02:27:05.149
JACKSON AND OTHERS MADE SO JUST

02:27:05.216 --> 02:27:07.151
WANTED TO BUT CENTER MITCHELL GO

02:27:07.218 --> 02:27:07.385
AHEAD.

02:27:07.451 --> 02:27:08.553
I WAS MY QUESTION THAT YEAH THAT

02:27:08.619 --> 02:27:10.254
SINCE WE ALL AGREE THAT POLL BUT

02:27:10.321 --> 02:27:11.589
NOT ALL SOME OF US AGREE THAT

02:27:11.656 --> 02:27:18.596
WHOLE BAR IS IN NEED OF A REVIEW.

02:27:18.663 --> 02:27:20.498
I JUST WONDER IF WE WILL EVER

02:27:20.565 --> 02:27:22.233
GET TO THAT POSITION IF.

02:27:22.300 --> 02:27:23.935
CATEGORIES OF PEOPLE CONTINUE TO

02:27:24.001 --> 02:27:25.603
BE ADDED TO IT IF IF THAT WILL

02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:28.573
MAKE THAT CONVERSATION ALL THE

02:27:28.639 --> 02:27:29.173
MORE COMPLICATED I GUESS THAT

02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:29.740
WITH ONLY.

02:27:29.807 --> 02:27:30.775
LIKE I SAID WE WILL HAVE YET

02:27:30.841 --> 02:27:31.275
ANOTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE

02:27:31.342 --> 02:27:33.611
POTENTIALLY OPPOSE ANY CHANGES.

02:27:33.678 --> 02:27:36.280
TO THE NEW PROTECTIONS THAT THEY

02:27:36.347 --> 02:27:38.616
WILL HAVE GAINED IF THIS BILL

02:27:38.683 --> 02:27:39.217
WERE TO BECOME LAW THAT WAS I

02:27:39.283 --> 02:27:42.119
WOULD.

02:27:42.186 --> 02:27:44.021
ALL RIGHT CENTER ARTILLERY LIKE

02:27:44.088 --> 02:27:45.022
TO CLOSE THANK YOU AND IF YOU'RE

02:27:45.089 --> 02:27:45.923
IN THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON

02:27:45.990 --> 02:27:47.291
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WHEN

02:27:47.358 --> 02:27:49.093
WE'RE TALKING BUT FAIR AND SHE

02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:51.229
QUALITY AND I THINK WHEN THIS

02:27:51.295 --> 02:27:52.230
THIS THING STARTED.

02:27:52.296 --> 02:27:55.066
NOBODY ACTUALLY REALIZED EQUAL

02:27:55.132 --> 02:27:57.535
WORK EQUAL PAY EQUAL OPPORTUNITY

02:27:57.602 --> 02:27:59.937
THIS IS ONE THAT WE CAN CORRECT

02:28:00.004 --> 02:28:01.372
TODAY BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT

02:28:01.439 --> 02:28:02.506
WHAT IF WE WERE TALKING.

02:28:02.573 --> 02:28:04.275
ABOUT WOMEN DOING A CERTAIN

02:28:04.342 --> 02:28:05.876
THING OR MEN DOING A CERTAIN

02:28:05.943 --> 02:28:07.245
THING BUT AS I'VE EXPRESSED IN

02:28:07.311 --> 02:28:09.046
AND IN THE PAST IN THE MILITARY

02:28:09.113 --> 02:28:10.548
IT'S LEVELED OFF IN THIS IS AN

02:28:10.615 --> 02:28:12.783
EXAMPLE FOR US TO DO THESAME

02:28:12.850 --> 02:28:13.217
THING.

02:28:13.284 --> 02:28:14.919
WE GOT A LEVEL OFF THE PLAYING

02:28:14.986 --> 02:28:16.487
FIELD IN EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE

02:28:16.554 --> 02:28:18.656
THE EQUAL RIGHTS EQUAL SAY AND

02:28:18.723 --> 02:28:20.157
EQUAL PROTECTION.

02:28:20.224 --> 02:28:21.425
AND THAT'S THE IDEA AND THIS IS

02:28:21.492 --> 02:28:23.961
WHY THIS IS COME FORWARD NOW AS

02:28:24.028 --> 02:28:25.763
I MENTIONED THERE THERE'S NO

02:28:25.830 --> 02:28:27.064
REASON WHY ONE SHOULD A

02:28:27.131 --> 02:28:27.932
SUPERVISOR.

02:28:27.999 --> 02:28:31.636
SHOULD TREAT SOMEONE DIFFERENTLY

02:28:31.702 --> 02:28:33.271
THAN SOMEONE ELSE.

02:28:33.337 --> 02:28:33.938
WHEN IF WE'RE ALL UNDER THE SAME

02:28:34.005 --> 02:28:34.905
UMBRELLA IN THE RULE OF LAW?

02:28:34.972 --> 02:28:36.073
THEN EVERYONE CAN GO RIGHT TO

02:28:36.140 --> 02:28:38.142
THE RULE BOOK AND SAY THIS IS

02:28:38.209 --> 02:28:39.577
WHAT WAS DONE RIGHT THIS IS WITH

02:28:39.644 --> 02:28:40.911
DONE WRONG WE CAN ALL IT HERE TO

02:28:40.978 --> 02:28:42.079
IT.

02:28:42.146 --> 02:28:43.547
SO THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY THAT

02:28:43.614 --> 02:28:45.950
WE CAN BALLOTS TO SCALE IN OTHER

02:28:46.017 --> 02:28:47.285
THINGS TO DO IN THE FUTURE

02:28:47.351 --> 02:28:48.719
PROBABLY SO.

02:28:48.786 --> 02:28:50.521
IS YOUR THINGS TO DO TO DO -- I

02:28:50.588 --> 02:28:52.490
WOULD IMAGINE AT BUT I THINK

02:28:52.556 --> 02:28:54.425
THIS IS THE DOOR OPENER THAT

02:28:54.492 --> 02:28:56.260
WILL BRING US BACK TOGETHER SO

02:28:56.327 --> 02:28:58.162
WE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT WE'VE GOT

02:28:58.229 --> 02:28:59.997
TO TREAT EVERYONE FAIRLY AND

02:29:00.064 --> 02:29:00.298
EQUITABLY.

02:29:00.364 --> 02:29:01.532
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE DOING

02:29:01.599 --> 02:29:04.602
THE SAME JOB AT THE SAME PAY AND

02:29:04.669 --> 02:29:07.138
THE SAME LOCATION.

02:29:07.204 --> 02:29:10.675

02:37:40.417 --> 02:37:41.151
BEHAVIOR.

02:37:41.218 --> 02:37:42.319
THAT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO

02:37:42.386 --> 02:37:44.888
MISUSE FIREARMS GOING FORWARD

02:37:44.955 --> 02:37:46.390

RECENT RESEARCH FROM THE CENTER

02:38:27.197 --> 02:38:28.699

02:38:28.765 --> 02:38:30.234
BETWEEN A CONVICTION FOR AN

02:38:51.622 --> 02:38:52.055
THIS IS A MEASURE THAT

02:38:52.122 --> 02:38:53.991
IDENTIFIES WHO THE PEOPLE ARE

TRY TO PROTECT AGAINST THAT KIND

02:38:58.362 --> 02:38:59.997

02:39:29.026 --> 02:39:30.560
THAT INDICATES THAT PEOPLE WHO

02:39:30.627 --> 02:39:32.229
WERE PREVIOUSLY CONVICTED OF

02:39:32.296 --> 02:39:33.764
CRIMES BUT HAVE NOT CAN BE A

02:39:33.830 --> 02:39:35.832
COMMITTED ANY NEW CRIMES. FOR A

02:39:35.899 --> 02:39:37.634
TEN YEAR PERIOD HAVE ABOUT THE

02:39:37.701 --> 02:39:39.503
SAME LIKELIHOOD OF COMMITTING A

02:39:39.569 --> 02:39:41.505
FIREARM OFFENSE AS THOSE WHO

02:39:41.571 --> 02:39:43.674
HAVE NEVER PREVIOUSLY COMMITTED

02:39:43.740 --> 02:39:44.841
ANY CRIMES.

02:39:44.908 --> 02:39:47.544
RESEARCH PINPOINTED TRYING TO

02:39:47.611 --> 02:39:49.146
ADDRESS A PROBLEM TO GET

02:39:49.212 --> 02:39:50.681
FIREARMS OUT OF THE HANDS OF

02:39:50.747 --> 02:39:52.582
PEOPLE IN ALL OUR COMMUNITIES

02:39:52.649 --> 02:39:54.184
WHO WOULD BE LIKELY TO USE THEM.

02:39:54.251 --> 02:39:55.419
AND THIS MEASURE IS

02:39:55.485 --> 02:39:57.521
SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO A BILL

02:39:57.587 --> 02:39:59.756
THAT SENATOR WOKE BROUGHT --

02:39:59.823 --> 02:40:00.724

IRONICALLY THE BILL WAS VETOED

02:40:07.564 --> 02:40:09.099
BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR SAID AT

02:40:09.166 --> 02:40:09.666
THAT TIME WE DON'T HAVE ANY

02:40:09.733 --> 02:40:10.867
RESEARCH.

02:40:10.934 --> 02:40:12.769
WE HAVE THE RESEARCH WE'RE HERE

02:40:12.836 --> 02:40:14.237
TODAY BECAUSE THAT RESEARCH

02:40:14.304 --> 02:40:16.106
INDICATES THAT THIS WILL HELP TO

02:40:16.173 --> 02:40:18.241
SAVE LIVES AND DO SO IN A WAY

02:40:18.308 --> 02:40:20.177
THAT IS DEMONSTRATED BY.

02:40:20.243 --> 02:40:22.045

OF LEGALLY AUTHORIZED PURCHASERS

02:43:39.910 --> 02:43:41.678
OF HAND GUNS HERE IN CALIFORNIA

02:43:41.745 --> 02:43:43.180
A PAST BACKGROUND CHECK WE WENT

02:43:43.246 --> 02:43:44.681
ALL THROUGH ALL THE HOOPS.

02:43:44.748 --> 02:43:46.216
THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO

02:43:46.283 --> 02:43:48.218
COMPARE PEOPLE WHO HAD PRIOR

02:43:48.285 --> 02:43:50.687
CONVICTIONS FOR DIY AND OTHER

ALCOHOL RELATED OFFENSES.

02:43:52.422 --> 02:43:53.657
WITH PURCHASERS WHO HAD NO

02:43:53.723 --> 02:43:55.725
CRIMINAL HISTORY AND THIS IS

02:43:55.792 --> 02:43:56.793
WHAT WE FOUND.

02:43:56.860 --> 02:43:58.862
AMONG THOSE WITH A DO YOU AYE

02:43:58.929 --> 02:44:02.999
HISTORY NEARLY A THIRD 33% WERE

02:44:03.066 --> 02:44:03.633
ARRESTED AFTER PURCHASING THEIR

02:44:03.700 --> 02:44:06.436
FIREARMS FOR A FIREARM RELATED

02:44:06.503 --> 02:44:09.472

OR AGGRAVATED ASSAULT.

02:44:14.844 --> 02:44:16.046
EVEN AFTER STATISTICALLY

02:44:16.112 --> 02:44:17.681
ADJUSTING FOR DIFFERENCES IN

02:44:17.747 --> 02:44:20.183
POPULATIONS THEY WERE SIX TIMES

02:44:20.250 --> 02:44:22.652
AS LIKELY AS PURCHASERS WITH NO

02:44:22.719 --> 02:44:24.221
PRIOR CRIMINAL HISTORY TO BE

02:44:24.287 --> 02:44:26.656
ARRESTED FOR THOSE OFFENSES.

02:44:26.723 --> 02:44:29.059

FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THEIR

02:44:44.307 --> 02:44:45.775

SCREENING AND DENIAL OF FIREARMS

02:45:07.264 --> 02:45:07.831
PURCHASE.

02:45:07.897 --> 02:45:09.966
WORKS RESEARCH THAT WE DID THAT

02:45:10.033 --> 02:45:11.334
WAS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL

INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE ON FIREARMS

02:45:14.137 --> 02:45:16.406
PURCHASERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:45:16.473 --> 02:45:18.541
DETERMINED WHEN WHEN WE CHANGED

PURCHASING FIREARMS.

02:45:23.980 --> 02:45:26.049
THAT POLICY CHANGE THAT NEW

02:45:26.116 --> 02:45:28.218
PROHIBITION REDUCED THEIR RISK

02:45:28.285 --> 02:45:30.120
OF ARREST FOR A VIOLENT CRIME BY

02:45:30.186 --> 02:45:32.355
30% WHICH IS A VERY SUBSTANTIAL

02:45:32.422 --> 02:45:34.958
AFFECT PORTED MINISTRY OF WE

POLICY.

02:45:38.261 --> 02:45:39.629
FINALLY AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED

02:45:39.696 --> 02:45:41.331
THIS IS A VERY NARROWLY FOCUSED

02:45:41.398 --> 02:45:43.400
BILL.

02:45:43.466 --> 02:45:45.101
THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS TALKS

02:45:45.168 --> 02:45:47.103
ABOUT THE FACT THAT SOMETHING

02:45:47.170 --> 02:45:48.538
LIKE THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND

02:45:48.605 --> 02:45:49.873
PEOPLE EACH YEAR RECEIVE A

02:45:49.939 --> 02:45:52.275
SECOND DO YOU AYE CONVICTION.

02:45:52.342 --> 02:45:54.177
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER

02:45:54.244 --> 02:45:55.812
THAT ONLY A MINORITY OF THOSE

02:45:55.879 --> 02:45:57.547
CONVICTIONS OCCUR IN CLOSE

02:45:57.614 --> 02:45:59.683
PROXIMITY IN TIME TO THE FIRST

02:45:59.749 --> 02:46:00.483
AND THE TO HAVE TO BE CLOSE

02:46:00.550 --> 02:46:02.986
TOGETHER OR NOW THREE FOR THEM

02:46:03.053 --> 02:46:03.420
TO BE PROHIBITING.

02:46:03.486 --> 02:46:05.622
NUMBERTOO MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE

02:46:05.689 --> 02:46:07.324
ARE ALREADY PROHIBITED FOR OTHER

02:46:07.390 --> 02:46:09.759
REASONS MISDEMEANOR VIOLENCE AND

02:46:09.826 --> 02:46:11.394
SO FORTH AND FINALLY ONLY ABOUT

02:46:11.461 --> 02:46:13.296
ONE ADULT IN SIX IN CALIFORNIA

02:46:13.363 --> 02:46:14.898
ON TO FIRE.

02:46:14.964 --> 02:46:16.399
SO WHEN YOU ADD THOSE THINGS IN

02:46:16.466 --> 02:46:17.767
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE ESTIMATE

02:46:17.834 --> 02:46:19.336
OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO

02:46:19.402 --> 02:46:20.804
MIGHT BE ADDED TWO APPS BY THIS.

02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:23.606
IS ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED A YEAR.

02:46:23.673 --> 02:46:24.507
WE ACTUALLY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO

02:46:24.574 --> 02:46:26.276
ESTIMATE THAT LARGE STUDY THAT I

02:46:26.343 --> 02:46:27.644
JUST MENTIONED OF AN ENTIRE

02:46:27.711 --> 02:46:29.879
YEAR'S WORTH OF HANDGUN

02:46:29.946 --> 02:46:30.480
PURCHASERS WE'VE LOOKED AT THE

02:46:30.547 --> 02:46:31.715
DATA.

02:46:31.781 --> 02:46:33.116
OF NEARLY A HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:46:33.183 --> 02:46:35.251
PEOPLE IN THAT STUDY FIFTEEN

02:46:35.318 --> 02:46:36.219
HUNDRED HAVE A DO YOU AYE

02:46:36.286 --> 02:46:37.954
CONVICTION ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED

02:46:38.021 --> 02:46:38.888
HAVE TWO OR MORE.

02:46:38.955 --> 02:46:41.224
THIS IS A VERY TIGHTLY FOCUSED

02:46:41.291 --> 02:46:43.493
BUILT ON A VERY HIGH RISK GROUP.

02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:45.095
I'LL MAKE ONE LAST POINT JUST

02:46:45.161 --> 02:46:47.197
VERY BRIEFLY OF THERE IS CONCERN

02:46:47.263 --> 02:46:49.599
THAT WE SHARE ABOUT DIFFERENTIAL

02:46:49.666 --> 02:46:51.267
APPLICATION OF THE LAW ACROSS

GROUPS DEFINED BY RACE AND

02:46:53.236 --> 02:46:53.970
ETHNICITY WE HAVE LOOKED

02:46:54.037 --> 02:46:55.939
SPECIFICALLY.

02:46:56.005 --> 02:46:58.074
AT IN THAT LARGE STUDY AT RISK

02:46:58.141 --> 02:46:59.376
ASSOCIATED WITH THE Y. ACROSS

02:46:59.442 --> 02:47:02.846
SUBGROUPS BY RACE AND ETHNICITY

02:47:02.912 --> 02:47:04.514

02:48:38.241 --> 02:48:40.243
MISSED YOUR LASSEN REGARD TO

02:48:40.310 --> 02:48:41.478
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR BECAUSE THE

02:48:41.544 --> 02:48:42.645
ONE CONCERN I HAVE WITH THAT

02:48:42.712 --> 02:48:44.214
THAT WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE ARE

02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:44.647
CERTAIN.

02:48:44.714 --> 02:48:46.382
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE OVER POLICE

02:48:46.449 --> 02:48:50.253
THAT HAVE EXTRA -- D. Y. STOPS --

02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:51.754
AND ALL OF THAT AND SO THE THE

02:48:51.821 --> 02:48:53.957
LIKELIHOOD OF CERTAIN UNDER

02:48:54.023 --> 02:48:54.891
REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES

COMMUNITIES OF COLOR POOR

02:48:56.192 --> 02:48:56.993
COMMUNITIES.

02:48:57.060 --> 02:48:59.162
OF OF THE STOP ARE HIGHER THAN

02:48:59.229 --> 02:49:00.697
THE OTHER GEOGRAPHIC AREA THAT'S

02:49:00.763 --> 02:49:02.131
THE REALITY.

02:49:02.198 --> 02:49:03.099
THE OTHER QUESTION IS IF YOU

02:49:03.166 --> 02:49:04.334
COULD JUST.

02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:05.301
TELL ME WHAT YOU WHAT THE

02:49:05.368 --> 02:49:07.103
RESEARCH REVIEW IF YOU CAN APART

02:49:07.170 --> 02:49:11.641
ON THAT MY SECOND QUESTION IS.

02:49:11.708 --> 02:49:12.242
IN THE MEMBERS POSSESSION FOR

02:49:12.308 --> 02:49:13.576
SALE OF SPECIFIED NARCOTICS WE

02:49:13.643 --> 02:49:15.278
CERTAINLY HAVE.

02:49:15.345 --> 02:49:18.081
I HAVE LEARNED IN GOING THROUGH --

02:49:18.147 --> 02:49:19.716
PENAL CODE IN LOOKING AT A

02:49:19.782 --> 02:49:22.285
VARIETY OF OF OF POLICIES THAT

02:49:22.352 --> 02:49:26.155
YOU KNOW THE THE THE QUANTITY.

02:49:26.222 --> 02:49:28.625
THAT THE POSSESSION FOR SALE IS

02:49:28.691 --> 02:49:30.894
OFFERED IN THE EYES OF A COULD

02:49:30.960 --> 02:49:32.295
BE DETERMINED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT.

02:49:32.362 --> 02:49:35.164
THEY HAVE THE THE FLEXIBILITY TO

02:49:35.231 --> 02:49:37.400
DETERMINE IF THEY THINK IT'S AN

02:49:37.467 --> 02:49:38.668
AMOUNT THAT'S FOR MY PERSONAL

02:49:38.735 --> 02:49:40.537
CONSUMPTION OR FOR SALE SO I

02:49:40.603 --> 02:49:41.905
JUST WANNA MAKE SURE.

02:49:41.971 --> 02:49:44.741
THA THAT THAT'S TIGHT.

02:49:44.807 --> 02:49:48.311
AND THAT WE DON'T -- CONTINUE TO

02:49:48.378 --> 02:49:49.879
LEAVE THAT UP TO THE DISCRETION

02:49:49.946 --> 02:49:52.849
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.

02:49:52.916 --> 02:49:53.583
THANK YOU FOR BOTH THOSE

02:49:53.650 --> 02:49:57.086
QUESTIONS -- WE SHARE YOUR

02:49:57.153 --> 02:49:58.755
CONCERNS ABOUT DIFFERENTIAL

02:49:58.821 --> 02:50:00.423
ARREST RATES AND SO FORTH AND

02:50:00.490 --> 02:50:02.358
HAVE ALMOST COMPLETED A SEPARATE

02:50:02.425 --> 02:50:03.860
ANALYSIS OF THE DATA I'VE BEEN

02:50:03.927 --> 02:50:05.728
REFERRING TO SPECIFICALLY TO

02:50:05.795 --> 02:50:08.064
LOOK AT THAT AND WE FIND.

02:50:08.131 --> 02:50:10.433
DIFFERENTIAL APPLICATION OF DO

02:50:10.500 --> 02:50:13.169
YOU AYE STATUTES IN CALIFORNIA --

02:50:13.236 --> 02:50:15.138
WHICH IF YOU WILL CREATE A BIAS

02:50:15.204 --> 02:50:17.840
IN THE DATA AS THEY COME TO US.

02:50:17.907 --> 02:50:20.143
WE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THAT BIAS

02:50:20.209 --> 02:50:22.312
SO WHAT WE DECIDED TO DO WAS

02:50:22.378 --> 02:50:23.880
WITH THE DATA IN FRONT OF US.

02:50:23.947 --> 02:50:26.616
DOES IT REMAIN THE CASE THAT FOR

02:50:26.683 --> 02:50:27.850
WHITE NON HISPANICS FOUR

02:50:27.917 --> 02:50:29.953
HISPANICS FOR NON HISPANIC

02:50:30.019 --> 02:50:31.220
AFRICAN AMERICANS WITHIN THE

02:50:31.287 --> 02:50:32.388
DATA.

02:50:32.455 --> 02:50:34.457
IS IT THE CASE THAT HAVING A

02:50:34.524 --> 02:50:36.225
PRIOR DUI CONVICTION IS

02:50:36.292 --> 02:50:38.628
ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED

02:50:38.695 --> 02:50:40.263
RISK FOR VIOLENCE IN THE FUTURE.

02:50:40.330 --> 02:50:41.464
IF THE ARRESTS WERE IF IF YOU

02:50:41.531 --> 02:50:42.966
WILL COMPLETELY BOGUS WE

02:50:43.032 --> 02:50:44.133
PROBABLY WOULDN'T SEE THE

02:50:44.200 --> 02:50:45.702
INCREASE IN RISK.

02:50:45.768 --> 02:50:47.303
WE DO SEE THE INCREASE IN RISK

02:50:47.370 --> 02:50:49.205
FOR AFRICAN AERICANS IS ABOUT A

02:50:49.272 --> 02:50:51.441
FACTOR OF TWO POINT FIVE STILL A

02:50:51.507 --> 02:50:52.542
TWO HUNDRED AND 50%.

02:50:52.609 --> 02:50:55.178
INCREASE IN RISK ASSOCIATED WITH

02:50:55.244 --> 02:50:57.246
THE D. Y. CONVICTION IN AN

02:50:57.313 --> 02:50:58.214
ANALYSIS JUST AMONG AFRICAN

02:50:58.281 --> 02:51:00.049
AMERICANS.

02:51:00.116 --> 02:51:01.417
SIMILAR RESULTS -- FOR ANALYSES

02:51:01.484 --> 02:51:03.019
AMONG HISPANICS AND SO FORTH AND

02:51:03.086 --> 02:51:04.420
WE WILL BE PUBLISHING THAT

02:51:04.487 --> 02:51:07.323
INFORMATION AS WELL -- YOU I'M

02:51:07.390 --> 02:51:10.827

02:51:10.893 --> 02:51:12.362
NARCOTICS.

02:51:12.428 --> 02:51:13.529
A BROADER POINT IS IT MANY MANY

02:51:13.596 --> 02:51:14.130
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ARE

02:51:14.197 --> 02:51:14.697
AWARE.

02:51:14.764 --> 02:51:15.465
THERE ARE MANY CRITICAL

02:51:15.531 --> 02:51:17.000
QUESTIONS FOR WHICH WE DON'T

02:51:17.066 --> 02:51:18.334
HAVE ANSWERS BECAUSE THERE'S

02:51:18.401 --> 02:51:19.969
BEEN AN ORGANIZED EFFORT TO KEEP

02:51:20.036 --> 02:51:21.604
THE WORK FROM BEING DONE.

02:51:21.671 --> 02:51:23.573
RIGHT BEHIND THIS ALCOHOL STUDY

02:51:23.640 --> 02:51:25.742
IT USING THE SAME DATA WE'LL BE

02:51:25.808 --> 02:51:27.410
LOOKING WITHIN CALIFORNIA AT

02:51:27.477 --> 02:51:29.312
RISK ASSOCIATED WITH DRUG

02:51:29.379 --> 02:51:30.780
CONVICTIONS WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT

02:51:30.847 --> 02:51:31.914
WORK YET.

02:51:31.981 --> 02:51:33.349
BUT THE LITERATURE -- WILL

02:51:33.416 --> 02:51:35.118
SUPPORT THE FOLLOWING GENERAL

02:51:35.184 --> 02:51:35.518
STATEMENTS.

02:51:35.585 --> 02:51:37.153
THERE IS A VERY CLEAR

02:51:37.220 --> 02:51:40.123
ASSOCIATION BETWEEN STIMULANT

02:51:40.189 --> 02:51:42.025
USE AMPHETAMINES COCAINE ET

02:51:42.091 --> 02:51:43.860
CETERA AN INCREASED RISK IN

02:51:43.926 --> 02:51:44.994
EVERY POPULATION WHICH IT'S EVER

02:51:45.061 --> 02:51:46.763
BEEN LOOKED AT FOR OPIOIDS THE

02:51:46.829 --> 02:51:48.731
ANSWER IS MIXED FOR MARIJUANA

02:51:48.798 --> 02:51:50.066
THE ANSWER IS MIXED THERE ARE

02:51:50.133 --> 02:51:51.034
STUDY SHOWING.

02:51:51.100 --> 02:51:52.735
A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN RISK

02:51:52.802 --> 02:51:54.671
FOR VIOLENCE ASSOCIATED WITH

02:51:54.737 --> 02:51:57.040
MARIJUANA USE NOT TODAY'S TOPIC.

02:51:57.106 --> 02:51:59.208
I DON'T HAVE INFORMATION FOR YOU

02:51:59.275 --> 02:52:01.911
ON THE SPECIFIC OFFENSES IN THE

02:52:01.978 --> 02:52:02.111
BILL.

02:52:02.178 --> 02:52:04.781
I HOPE TO WHEN WE GET THAT STUDY

02:52:04.847 --> 02:52:06.215
DONE [inaudible]

02:52:06.282 --> 02:52:07.617
THANK YOU.

SURE YOU'RE GETTING YOUR ANSWERS

02:52:12.221 --> 02:52:12.922
ARE GETTING CLOSER TO WHERE I

02:52:12.989 --> 02:52:13.589
WANT TO GO.

02:52:13.656 --> 02:52:14.691
A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:52:14.757 --> 02:52:17.093
MENTALLY ILL MOVIES REALLY DON'T

02:52:17.160 --> 02:52:17.427
WANT TO SEE.

02:52:17.493 --> 02:52:20.596
HAVING GUNS AND ERROR.

02:52:20.663 --> 02:52:22.965
BUT THEY BUT THEY SELF MEDICATE.

02:52:23.032 --> 02:52:24.400
SO THROUGHOUT THE HALL THROUGH

02:52:24.467 --> 02:52:25.435
MARIJUANA THROUGH.

02:52:25.501 --> 02:52:28.104
ALL THE OTHER.

02:52:28.171 --> 02:52:29.372
STATE YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT WAS

02:52:29.439 --> 02:52:30.873
THERE A CORRELATION AT ALL COULD

02:52:30.940 --> 02:52:32.775
YOU SEE IN THE DATA THAT.

02:52:32.842 --> 02:52:34.911
MAYBE THAT EVEN IF THEY HAD A DO

02:52:34.977 --> 02:52:35.511
YOU WHY THEY WERE ALSO

02:52:35.578 --> 02:52:35.812
[inaudible]

02:52:35.878 --> 02:52:38.247
MENTALLY ILL.

02:52:38.314 --> 02:52:39.916
NO BECAUSE THAT INFORMATION IS

02:52:39.982 --> 02:52:41.217
NOT IN THE DATA -- WE ARE

02:52:41.284 --> 02:52:43.619
LOOKING AT RECORDS FOR GUN

02:52:43.686 --> 02:52:46.189
PURCHASING AN CRIMINAL RECORDS

02:52:46.255 --> 02:52:48.357
SO WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO

02:52:48.424 --> 02:52:51.027
MENTAL HEALTH DATA WE ARE WE

02:52:51.094 --> 02:52:52.228
WERE ALSO DOING AN EVALUATION OF

02:52:52.295 --> 02:52:53.963
THE APPS PROGRAM WITH SUPPORT

02:52:54.030 --> 02:52:55.064
FROM.

02:52:55.131 --> 02:52:56.999
DOJ AND FUNDING FROM AND I J.

02:52:57.066 --> 02:52:59.268
THERE WE WILL HAVE A LOOK AT A

02:52:59.335 --> 02:52:59.969
LARGER COMMENT AND IT'S ACTUALLY

02:53:00.036 --> 02:53:01.771
I I'M GONNA BRING IT BACK TO THE

02:53:01.838 --> 02:53:03.372
SUBSTANCE ABUSE SIDE OF THIS.

02:53:03.439 --> 02:53:05.908
ONE OF THE I'M IN A SOME RICE

02:53:05.975 --> 02:53:06.909
RESEARCH BRIEFLY HERE.

02:53:06.976 --> 02:53:08.745
MENTAL ILLNESS EVEN SERIOUS

02:53:08.811 --> 02:53:11.881
MENTAL ILLNESS BY ITSELF.

02:53:11.948 --> 02:53:13.883
IS ASSOCIATED WITH A RISK FOR

02:53:13.950 --> 02:53:15.618
FUTURE VIOLENCE THAT'S SMALL

02:53:15.685 --> 02:53:16.686
ENOUGH.

02:53:16.753 --> 02:53:18.087
THAT NOT EVERY CAREFULLY DONE

02:53:18.154 --> 02:53:19.155
STUDY HAS EVEN FOUND IT TO BE

02:53:19.222 --> 02:53:20.857
THERE.

02:53:20.923 --> 02:53:22.792
WHAT HAPPENS IN AS IT DOES IN

02:53:22.859 --> 02:53:24.761
THE GENERAL POPULATION IS BAD

02:53:24.827 --> 02:53:27.029
MENTAL ILLNESS? TO A PRIOR

02:53:27.096 --> 02:53:29.232
HISTORY OF VIOLENCE TO SUBSTANCE

02:53:29.298 --> 02:53:30.533
ABUSE AND THEN THE RISK IN THE

02:53:30.600 --> 02:53:31.667
FUTURE GETS VERY HIGH BUT

02:53:31.734 --> 02:53:33.469
VIOLENCE AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE ARE

02:53:33.536 --> 02:53:35.638
RISK FACTORS. FOR FUTURE

02:53:35.705 --> 02:53:36.305
VIOLENCE IN THE GENERAL

02:53:36.372 --> 02:53:39.308
POPULATION SO ONE WAY AND I

02:53:39.375 --> 02:53:40.977
TEACH MY STUDENTS ABOUT THIS ONE

02:53:41.043 --> 02:53:43.246
WAY TO GET AT THE MENTAL ILLNESS

02:53:43.312 --> 02:53:45.214
PROBLEM IS TO GO AFTER SUBSTANCE

02:53:45.281 --> 02:53:46.182
ABUSE WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE DOING

02:53:46.249 --> 02:53:46.949
TODAY.

02:53:47.016 --> 02:53:50.987
I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY THE LINKS

02:53:51.053 --> 02:53:53.923
HAVE TEN YEARS WAS SELECTED.

02:53:53.990 --> 02:53:55.391
THE DISSECT CLARIFICATION THERE

02:53:55.458 --> 02:53:58.027
ARE. TWO COMPONENTS THERE'S A

02:53:58.094 --> 02:53:59.695
THREE YEAR IN A TEN YEAR.

02:53:59.762 --> 02:54:01.464
SO THE THREE YEAR.

02:54:01.531 --> 02:54:04.100
SO THE IT OUT IN THE AMENDED

02:54:04.167 --> 02:54:08.304
BILL OKAY SO THE WE NEED IN THE

02:54:08.371 --> 02:54:11.040
AMENDED BILL. ONE WOULD HAVE TO

02:54:11.107 --> 02:54:14.744
BE HAVE TWO OR MORE CONVICTION.

02:54:14.811 --> 02:54:16.979
OF POSSESSION OF THOSE SPECIFIED

02:54:17.046 --> 02:54:18.781
NARCOTICS FOR SALE.

02:54:18.848 --> 02:54:20.049
SO YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE TWO OR

02:54:20.116 --> 02:54:21.284
MORE CONVICTIONS OF THAT WERE TO

02:54:21.350 --> 02:54:22.985
MORE CONVICTIONS OF THE GROSS

02:54:23.052 --> 02:54:24.320
VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER WHILE

02:54:24.387 --> 02:54:25.988
INTOXICATED.

02:54:26.055 --> 02:54:28.124
IN A THREE YEAR PERIOD.

02:54:28.191 --> 02:54:29.826
THE TEN YEAR PERIOD IS THREE OR

02:54:29.892 --> 02:54:32.595
MORE DO YOU ICE.

02:54:32.662 --> 02:54:33.996
SO MAYBE I'M NOT ASKING THE

02:54:34.063 --> 02:54:36.232
QUESTION CORRECTLY MADAM CHAIR --

02:54:36.299 --> 02:54:37.733
WOULD WORK WERE SAYING YOU

02:54:37.800 --> 02:54:40.303
CANNOT APPLY FOR A OR PURCHASE A

02:54:40.369 --> 02:54:43.306
HANDGUN FOR TEN YEARS.

02:54:43.372 --> 02:54:46.943
A TEN YEARS THAT SIX EIGHT AND

02:54:47.009 --> 02:54:47.777
IT IS WE'RE JUST MODELING AFTER

02:54:47.844 --> 02:54:49.412
EXISTING LIE I JUST WONDERED IF

02:54:49.478 --> 02:54:50.413
THERE IS A HISTORY OF WHITE TO

02:54:50.479 --> 02:54:52.081
ADD SELECT YES THAT WAS THE

02:54:52.148 --> 02:54:53.216
REASON THAT WE LOOKED AT THE TEN

02:54:53.282 --> 02:54:54.917
YEAR I THINK ALSO THE RESEARCH

02:54:54.984 --> 02:54:57.119
INDICATED.

02:54:57.186 --> 02:54:59.355
THAT IF A PERSON IS --

02:54:59.422 --> 02:55:01.624
CONVICTION FREE FOR A PERIOD OF

02:55:01.691 --> 02:55:02.825
TEN YEARS IT USUALLY IS AN

02:55:02.892 --> 02:55:03.860
INDICATION THEY'VE KIND OF

02:55:03.926 --> 02:55:05.094
GOTTEN THEIR LIFE BACK TOGETHER

02:55:05.161 --> 02:55:07.630
AGAIN SO WE AGAIN THE GOAL IS TO

02:55:07.697 --> 02:55:10.166
DEAL WITH THAT HIGH RISK ELEMENT

02:55:10.233 --> 02:55:12.134
VERY FOCUSED PINPOINTED.

02:55:12.201 --> 02:55:14.203
AND ALSO TO GET THE GUNS OUT OF

02:55:14.270 --> 02:55:16.105
THEIR HANDS AND NODDED AND

02:55:16.172 --> 02:55:17.707
ADDITIONAL CRIMINAL OFFENSE FOR

02:55:17.773 --> 02:55:19.108
WHICH THEY'RE GOING TO BE

02:55:19.175 --> 02:55:20.676
PUNISHED WHICH JUST KNOWING THAT

02:55:20.743 --> 02:55:22.545
THERE IS SAID GREATER PROPENSITY

02:55:22.612 --> 02:55:23.946
FOR THE USE OF FIREARMS.

02:55:24.013 --> 02:55:26.382
WHICH IS REMOVING ACCESS TO THEM

02:55:26.449 --> 02:55:29.952
FOR THAT FOR THAT TEN YEAR

02:55:30.019 --> 02:55:31.254
PERIOD OF TIME.

02:55:31.320 --> 02:55:32.054
IN CENTER JACKSON'S YOUR BILL

02:55:32.121 --> 02:55:33.522
UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA OR HAS IT

02:55:33.589 --> 02:55:34.423
BEEN TRIED YOU'RE DONE SOMEWHERE

02:55:34.490 --> 02:55:35.858
ELSE I BELIEVE THIS IS UNIQUE TO

02:55:35.925 --> 02:55:37.026
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S

02:55:37.093 --> 02:55:38.928
ONE OF THE FEW PLACES WHERE WE

02:55:38.995 --> 02:55:39.629
ACTUALLY ARE DOING.

02:55:39.695 --> 02:55:42.465
RESEARCH ON GUN VIOLENCE WHICH

02:55:42.531 --> 02:55:43.933
ISN'T INTO AN ART AN IRONY OF

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.235
COURSE I KNOW THAT I BELIEVE THE

02:55:46.302 --> 02:55:47.870
CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL HAS

02:55:47.937 --> 02:55:51.140
STUFF MINIMAL -- BUT THERE'S

02:55:51.207 --> 02:55:53.743
BEEN -- UP.

02:55:53.809 --> 02:55:57.647
SADLY A OF A PUSH AGAINST

02:55:57.713 --> 02:55:59.782
KNOWLEDGE FUNNY AREA OF THIS

02:55:59.849 --> 02:56:01.517
KIND OF PROPENSITY FOR VIOLENT

02:56:01.584 --> 02:56:04.387
FIREARMS RELATED BEHAVIOR AND IT

02:56:04.453 --> 02:56:06.689
WASN'T UNTIL I BELIEVE IT WAS

02:56:06.756 --> 02:56:08.157
TWENTY FOURTEEN OR TWENTY

02:56:08.224 --> 02:56:09.158
FIFTEEN WHEN.

02:56:09.225 --> 02:56:11.127
SENATOR WILK WAS ABLE TO GET

02:56:11.193 --> 02:56:14.096
THIS BILL PASSED AND FUNDED SO

02:56:14.163 --> 02:56:16.632
THAT THE RESEARCH COULD BE DONE

02:56:16.699 --> 02:56:18.134
AND THE UC DAVIS WAS A

02:56:18.200 --> 02:56:20.970
DESIGNATED FACILITY THAT WE ARE.

02:56:21.037 --> 02:56:24.707
NOW ACTUALLY ABLE TO DO THAT-RESEARCH I KNOW OTHERS HAVE

02:56:24.774 --> 02:56:25.942
TRIED AND BEEN SOMEWHAT

02:56:26.008 --> 02:56:27.877
SUCCESSFUL BUT THIS IS TRULY THE

02:56:27.944 --> 02:56:29.912
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH.

02:56:29.979 --> 02:56:32.181
THAT DEMONSTRATES THE KINDS OF

02:56:32.248 --> 02:56:33.582
BEHAVIOR FOR A LOT OF US IT'S

02:56:33.649 --> 02:56:36.953
BEEN INTUITIVE -- BUT THIS IS

02:56:37.019 --> 02:56:39.522
ACTUAL -- FACT BATES SCIENCE

02:56:39.588 --> 02:56:41.657
THAT HAS BEEN PEER REVIEWED AND

02:56:41.724 --> 02:56:43.626
ALL OF THOSE IMPORTANT MEASURES

02:56:43.693 --> 02:56:45.695
HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN TO ASSURE

02:56:45.761 --> 02:56:47.363
THE ACCURACY OF THE DATA.

02:56:47.430 --> 02:56:50.700

MADE THE CHANGE LAST YEAR WE'VE

02:59:34.530 --> 02:59:34.964
CP THAT.

02:59:35.030 --> 02:59:36.599
THE WAY WE ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED

02:59:36.665 --> 02:59:38.234
THE BILL AND THE REASON THIS IS

02:59:38.300 --> 02:59:40.002
A SEPARATE NEW CRIME WE

02:59:40.069 --> 02:59:41.103
ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED IT IS

02:59:41.170 --> 02:59:42.938
SIMPLY A MODIFICATION TO THE

02:59:43.005 --> 02:59:43.539
EXISTING.

02:59:43.606 --> 02:59:46.142
CRIME ABOUT DOT WOULD HAVE HAD

02:59:46.208 --> 02:59:47.309
THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF

02:59:47.376 --> 02:59:49.111
POTENTIALLY OF EXPANDING FELONY

02:59:49.178 --> 02:59:51.647
MURDER AND SO WE CREATED A NEW

02:59:51.714 --> 02:59:52.882
CRIME NOT BECAUSE HE WANTED TO

02:59:52.948 --> 02:59:54.416
CREATE A NEW CRIME WE WANTED TO

02:59:54.483 --> 02:59:55.584
CHANGE EXISTING.

02:59:55.651 --> 02:59:56.485
ONE WE CREATE A NEW CRIME IN

02:59:56.552 --> 02:59:59.021
ORDER TO AVOID EXPANSION OF

02:59:59.088 --> 03:00:00.122
FELONY.

03:00:00.189 --> 03:00:02.825
MURDER -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR

03:00:02.892 --> 03:00:04.627

AS YOU MENTIONED THE SASS SIMPLY

03:00:23.579 --> 03:00:24.914
CLOSE A LOOPHOLE WHILE IT DEFIES

03:00:24.980 --> 03:00:25.548
LOGIC THE FACT THAT A VICTIMS

03:00:25.614 --> 03:00:26.749
WINDOW -- WAS BROKEN DOES NOT BY

03:00:26.815 --> 03:00:27.316
ITSELF ESTABLISHED THAT THE

03:00:27.383 --> 03:00:28.617
VEHICLE WAS LOCKED -- SO IN

03:00:28.684 --> 03:00:29.985
ORDER TO PROVE THAT THE DOOR WAS

03:00:30.052 --> 03:00:31.453
LOCKED IN THAT AND THE FENDER --

03:00:31.520 --> 03:00:32.354
BROKE THE WINDOW IN ORDER TO

03:00:32.421 --> 03:00:34.590
GAIN ENTRY WE OFTEN ASK VICTIMS

03:00:34.657 --> 03:00:36.025
TO COME BACK TO COURT TO TESTIFY.

03:00:36.091 --> 03:00:36.926
THIS PROVES EXCEEDINGLY

03:00:36.992 --> 03:00:38.460
DIFFICULT WHEN THE VICTIM IS A

03:00:38.527 --> 03:00:40.896
VISITOR AND THAT HAPPENS VERY

03:00:40.963 --> 03:00:41.130
OFTEN.

03:00:41.197 --> 03:00:43.566
BETWEEN PASSPORTS AND CAMERAS --

03:00:43.632 --> 03:00:45.568
VISITING VICTIMS ARE OFTEN ARE

03:00:45.634 --> 03:00:47.937
ACTUALLY THE MAJORITY OF VICTIMS --

03:00:48.003 --> 03:00:48.571
IN CAR BREAK INS ESPECIALLY IN

03:00:48.637 --> 03:00:50.139

03:00:50.206 --> 03:00:51.640
AND I GETTING THEM TO COME BACK

03:00:51.707 --> 03:00:54.076
WHEN THEY'VE LEFT OUR SUBPOENA

03:00:54.143 --> 03:00:54.310
POWER.

03:00:54.376 --> 03:00:55.611
BECOMES AN INCREASINGLY

03:00:55.678 --> 03:00:57.780
DIFFICULT AND THE AS A RESULT WE

03:00:57.846 --> 03:00:59.315
HAVE TO PROVE THAT AND THE DOOR

03:00:59.381 --> 03:01:00.282
WAS LOCKED THROUGH

03:01:00.349 --> 03:01:01.817
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE INSTEAD

03:01:01.884 --> 03:01:03.786
OF DIRECT EVIDENCE AND IT'S A

03:01:03.852 --> 03:01:06.155
IT'S A IT'S THE DANCE THAT IS.

03:01:06.222 --> 03:01:08.224
VERY -- UNNECESSARY CONSIDERING

03:01:08.290 --> 03:01:10.326
HOW -- OBVIOUS IT IS THAT THE

03:01:10.392 --> 03:01:11.894
DOOR WAS THAT THE WINDOW WAS

03:01:11.961 --> 03:01:13.329
BROKEN IN ORDER TO GAIN ENTRY TO

03:01:13.395 --> 03:01:14.430
A LOCKED VEHICLE.

03:01:14.496 --> 03:01:16.332
SO -- SB TWENTY THREE CLOSES

03:01:16.398 --> 03:01:18.067

03:01:37.319 --> 03:01:38.087
GENERAL.

03:01:38.153 --> 03:01:39.421
CAR BREAK INS ARE A REALLY

03:01:39.488 --> 03:01:41.490
TROUBLING SITUATION FOR OUR

03:01:41.557 --> 03:01:43.525
TOURISM INDUSTRY ESPECIALLY IN

03:01:43.592 --> 03:01:45.828
THE BAY AREA BUT REALLY ACROSS

03:01:45.894 --> 03:01:46.996
THE STATE.

03:01:47.062 --> 03:01:48.497
AND AS MENTIONED RENTAL CARS ARE

03:01:48.564 --> 03:01:49.798
OFTEN PARTICULAR TARGET THAT

03:01:49.865 --> 03:01:51.200
AFFECTS OUR TOURISM INDUSTRY

03:01:51.267 --> 03:01:54.203
NEGATIVELY -- COVERAGE THAT WE

03:01:54.270 --> 03:01:55.971

MEDIA AND ON PEOPLE SOCIAL MEDIA

03:01:57.439 --> 03:01:59.708
AMPLIFY THAT NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE

03:01:59.775 --> 03:02:02.711
AND THAT BREAKING CAUSES.

03:02:02.778 --> 03:02:03.979
IN THE CALIFORNIA TRAVEL AND

03:02:04.046 --> 03:02:05.748
TOURISM INDUSTRY WE TAKE GREAT

03:02:05.814 --> 03:02:07.249
PRIDE IN CREATING WONDERFUL

03:02:07.316 --> 03:02:09.952
EXPERIENCES FOR VISITORS AND

03:02:10.019 --> 03:02:11.153
ALSO FOR OUR RESIDENTS.

03:02:11.220 --> 03:02:12.521
WE BRING IN A HUNDRED AND THIRTY

03:02:12.588 --> 03:02:13.722
TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF DIRECT

03:02:13.789 --> 03:02:16.191
REVENUE EVERY YEAR AND ARE

03:02:16.258 --> 03:02:18.060
RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THAN ONE

03:02:18.127 --> 03:02:20.496

DOLLARS IN STATE AND LOCAL TAXES

03:02:22.031 --> 03:02:23.766
SO IT IS A SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRY

03:02:23.832 --> 03:02:24.800
THAT THIS IS HURTING.

03:02:24.867 --> 03:02:25.734
WHEN SOMEONE HAS A NEGATIVE

03:02:25.801 --> 03:02:28.537
EXPERIENCE LIKE A CAR BREAK IN?

03:02:28.604 --> 03:02:30.105
IT DOES ONLY RUIN THEIR TRIP BUT

03:02:30.172 --> 03:02:31.206
IT CREATES A NEGATIVE

03:02:31.273 --> 03:02:33.242
ASSOCIATION WITH THE CITY AND

03:02:33.309 --> 03:02:36.211
THE STATE OF THAT LINGERS.

03:02:36.278 --> 03:02:36.745
SO.

03:02:36.812 --> 03:02:39.214
RIGHT NOW CURRENT LAWS YOU HERDS --

03:02:39.281 --> 03:02:40.582
STATES THAT PROSECUTORS HAVE TO

03:02:40.649 --> 03:02:41.884
PROVE A CAR DOOR WAS LOCKED AS

03:02:41.950 --> 03:02:43.152
PART OF A BREAK IN.

03:02:43.218 --> 03:02:44.420
BUT WHEN INTEREST HAS THEIR

03:02:44.486 --> 03:02:46.121
RENTAL CAR BROKEN THEY'RE

03:02:46.188 --> 03:02:47.589
UNLIKELY TO RETURN TO TESTIFY

03:02:47.656 --> 03:02:49.658
FOR THAT TRIAL SO IT'S A KEY

03:02:49.725 --> 03:02:50.192
PIECE OF EVIDENCE THAT IS

03:02:50.259 --> 03:02:51.193
MISSING.

03:02:51.260 --> 03:02:52.928
SB TWENTY THREE WOULD HELP

INCLUDING FORCED ENTRY IS AN

03:02:55.564 --> 03:02:57.333
ELEMENT OF THE VEHICLE BREAKING

03:02:57.399 --> 03:02:58.400
STATUTES.

03:02:58.467 --> 03:02:59.702
AND IN OUR EYES THAT'S REALLY A

03:02:59.768 --> 03:03:01.670
WIN WIN WIN IT'S A IT'S A WIN

03:03:01.737 --> 03:03:02.371

03:03:02.438 --> 03:03:04.973
RESIDENTS AND FOR VISITORS.

03:03:05.040 --> 03:03:05.774
YOU'LL HELP ME QUIT LAW

03:03:05.841 --> 03:03:06.942

THEY NEED TO COMBAT CAR

03:03:08.444 --> 03:03:10.245
BURGLARIES AND HELP ENSURE THAT.

03:03:10.312 --> 03:03:11.180
VISITORS AND RESIDENTS HAVE A

POSITIVE EXPERIENCE IN

03:03:13.282 --> 03:03:14.416

CENTER WIENER REFERENCES BUT

03:03:41.777 --> 03:03:42.978
THIS BILL.

03:03:43.045 --> 03:03:44.279
WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT TO US LAST

03:03:44.346 --> 03:03:46.749
YEAR WE AMENDED IT SIGNIFICANTLY

03:03:46.815 --> 03:03:48.817
AND SO THE BILL NOW IS EXACTLY

03:03:48.884 --> 03:03:50.085
AS WE PASSED IT LAST YEAR WHICH

03:03:50.152 --> 03:03:52.121
HAD THE AMENDMENTS THAT REMOVED --

03:03:52.187 --> 03:03:55.124
ACLU'S OPPOSITION -- BUT WE WILL

03:03:55.190 --> 03:03:57.359
HEAR FROM OUR GO AHEAD.

03:03:57.426 --> 03:03:59.027
MY NAME IS LESLIE CALDWELL IN

03:03:59.094 --> 03:04:00.195
REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA

03:04:00.262 --> 03:04:02.531
PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AS

03:04:02.598 --> 03:04:05.267
MANY OF YOU KNOW WE HAVE ABOUT

03:04:05.334 --> 03:04:07.035
FOUR THOUSAND MEMBERS LAWYERS

03:04:07.102 --> 03:04:09.538
PRIVATE AND PUBLIC -- AND

03:04:09.605 --> 03:04:11.473
INVESTIGATORS AROUND THE STATE --

03:04:11.540 --> 03:04:14.243
I PERSONALLY RECENTLY RETIRED AS

03:04:14.309 --> 03:04:15.544
THE SOLANO COUNTY PUBLIC

03:04:15.611 --> 03:04:17.679
DEFENDER FOR NINE YEARS AND

03:04:17.746 --> 03:04:18.914
BEFORE THAT.

03:04:18.981 --> 03:04:22.217
I PRACTICED ANOTHER THIRTY YEARS

03:04:22.284 --> 03:04:24.887
AN INDIGENT DEFENSE -- WE

03:04:24.953 --> 03:04:27.723
BELIEVE THAT THIS UNNECESSARILY

03:04:27.790 --> 03:04:30.159
CREATE A NEW OFFENSE WE DO NOT

03:04:30.225 --> 03:04:31.226
BELIEVE.

03:04:31.293 --> 03:04:33.729
AS IS STATED IN THE NEED FOR THE

03:04:33.796 --> 03:04:35.063
BILL ACCORDING TO THE AUTHOR AND

03:04:35.130 --> 03:04:38.400
ALL DUE RESPECT -- IT IS NOT A

03:04:38.467 --> 03:04:41.136
STRIKE -- IT IS NOT AN

03:04:41.203 --> 03:04:43.705
INHERENTLY DANGEROUS -- FELONY

03:04:43.772 --> 03:04:46.208
AND THE FELONY MURDER RULE HAS

03:04:46.275 --> 03:04:48.076
BEEN CHANGED CONSIDERABLY SO

03:04:48.143 --> 03:04:50.712
THOSE CONCERNS I DON'T BELIEVE

03:04:50.779 --> 03:04:53.715
ARE VALID CONCERNS -- THERE IS

03:04:53.782 --> 03:04:55.050
AN INDICATION THAT IT'S A

03:04:55.117 --> 03:04:57.786
SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE -- FOR THE

03:04:57.853 --> 03:05:00.122
DEATH PENALTY.

03:05:00.189 --> 03:05:02.591
AND THE IN FACT IT IS BUT I'VE

03:05:02.658 --> 03:05:05.527
ONLY FUND ONE INSTANCE IN A

03:05:05.594 --> 03:05:07.996
LONG HISTORY OF IT BEING USED AS

03:05:08.063 --> 03:05:10.132
A SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE -- I

03:05:10.199 --> 03:05:11.567
LOOKED INTO THE LEGISLATIVE

03:05:11.633 --> 03:05:14.703
PURPOSE OF ONE OF THE LOCKED

03:05:14.770 --> 03:05:16.638
VEHICLE REQUIREMENT.

03:05:16.705 --> 03:05:18.774
AND AT THAT TIME IT WAS PUT IN

03:05:18.841 --> 03:05:20.509
THERE TO MAKE THE TRIP CRIME

03:05:20.576 --> 03:05:22.077
MORE SERIOUS THAN SOMEBODY JUST

03:05:22.144 --> 03:05:24.613
SIMPLY OPENING A DOOR AND TAKING

03:05:24.680 --> 03:05:25.280
SOMETHING.

03:05:25.347 --> 03:05:28.851
SO SIMPLE PETTY OR GRAND THEFT.

03:05:28.917 --> 03:05:30.652
THAT'S WHY IT WAS PUT IN THERE --

03:05:30.719 --> 03:05:32.421
YES THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH

03:05:32.488 --> 03:05:33.789
GETTING THE WITNESSES BACK WHEN

03:05:33.856 --> 03:05:36.191
THEY OUR TOURIST OR SOMEONE IN

03:05:36.258 --> 03:05:39.061
ANOTHER COUNTY -- AND PUTTING IN

03:05:39.127 --> 03:05:40.596
THIS.

03:05:40.662 --> 03:05:42.498
CHANGE DOESN'T ADDRESS.

03:05:42.564 --> 03:05:44.166
THE WHOLE PROBLEM BECAUSE IF YOU

03:05:44.233 --> 03:05:45.567
NEED A WITNESS TO COME IN AND

03:05:45.634 --> 03:05:49.037
SAY THE DOOR WAS LOCKED USE ALSO

03:05:49.104 --> 03:05:50.506
STILL NEED THE WITNESS EITHER AT

03:05:50.572 --> 03:05:51.740
A PRELIMINARY HEARING IN A

03:05:51.807 --> 03:05:53.642
FELONY OR THE TRIAL IN A

03:05:53.709 --> 03:05:56.144
MISDEMEANOR. TO SAY.

03:05:56.211 --> 03:05:59.748
THE THE CAR WAS ENTERED WITHOUT.

03:05:59.815 --> 03:06:02.751
THE DRIVER'S PERMISSION -- THE

03:06:02.818 --> 03:06:04.553
CASE LAW IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT

03:06:04.620 --> 03:06:07.356
MOST CASES SAY THAT A BROKEN

03:06:07.422 --> 03:06:10.726
WINDOW IS ACCEPTABLE AS A SIGN

03:06:10.792 --> 03:06:14.129
THAT THE DOORS WERE LOCKED -- SO

03:06:14.196 --> 03:06:15.764
THAT EVIDENCE IS ACCEPTED THE

03:06:15.831 --> 03:06:17.299
ONLY TIME IT'S A PROBLEM IS

03:06:17.366 --> 03:06:19.001
BECAUSE IT'S AN ELEMENT OF THE

03:06:19.067 --> 03:06:22.104
OFFENSE -- AND IT HAS TO BE

03:06:22.170 --> 03:06:24.206
PROVED AT TRIAL NOW THE

03:06:24.273 --> 03:06:26.708
PRELIMINARY HEARING YOU CAN JUST

03:06:26.775 --> 03:06:28.644
HAVE THE OFFICER TESTIFY SO THE

03:06:28.710 --> 03:06:30.078
ONLY TIME YOU NEED.

03:06:30.145 --> 03:06:32.814
A WITNESS IS AT TRIAL.

03:06:32.881 --> 03:06:34.049
WILL SAN FRANCISCO MAY HAVE

03:06:34.116 --> 03:06:38.086
SLIGHTLY HIGHER NUMBERS BUT ONLY

03:06:38.153 --> 03:06:40.222
123% OF ALL CASES IN THE

03:06:40.289 --> 03:06:42.391
CRIMINAL DEFENSE UNIVERSE OR THE

03:06:42.457 --> 03:06:44.259
CRIMINAL CHARGE UNIVERSE.

03:06:44.326 --> 03:06:48.997
GO TO TRIAL SO THIS NEW CRIME.

03:06:49.064 --> 03:06:50.065
DOES NOT ADDRESS THE WHOLE

03:06:50.132 --> 03:06:53.168
PROBLEM OF NEEDING THE WITNESS --

03:06:53.235 --> 03:06:56.638
SECONDLY THE ISSUE OF FORCIBLY

03:06:56.705 --> 03:06:58.373
HAS TO BE CLEARLY DEFINED IN THE

03:06:58.440 --> 03:07:01.777
LAW AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS.

03:07:01.843 --> 03:07:03.712
IN THE ROBBERY STATUTE THERE'S A

03:07:03.779 --> 03:07:06.682
TAKING BY FORCE OR FEAR OVER THE

03:07:06.748 --> 03:07:09.718
YEARS THE CASE LAW HAS HAS.

03:07:09.785 --> 03:07:11.820
PRETTY MUCH EVISCERATED THE

03:07:11.887 --> 03:07:14.923
MEANING OF FORCE SO IT HAS NO

03:07:14.990 --> 03:07:16.224
MEANING ANYMORE IN THE ROBBERY

03:07:16.291 --> 03:07:18.093
STATUTE.

03:07:18.160 --> 03:07:19.995
AND SO IT WON'T HAVE A MEANING.

03:07:20.062 --> 03:07:23.932
IN AN AUTO BURKE STATUTE AND I

03:07:23.999 --> 03:07:26.568
WOULD RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AND

03:07:26.635 --> 03:07:32.374
ASK FOR NAY VOTE.

03:07:32.441 --> 03:07:33.308
ALRIGHT LET ME SEE IF THERE'S

03:07:33.375 --> 03:07:34.443
ANY OTHER -- WITNESSES IN

03:07:34.509 --> 03:07:37.646
OPPOSITION.

03:07:37.713 --> 03:07:39.114
RIGHT SEEN NINE COMMENTS OR

03:07:39.181 --> 03:07:40.649
QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE SENATOR

03:07:40.716 --> 03:07:42.217
MORLOCK THANK YOU MANAGER I'M

03:07:42.284 --> 03:07:44.252
JUST CURIOUS -- ABOUT THE TRIAL

03:07:44.319 --> 03:07:45.487
ASPECT IN BRINGING THE WITNESS

03:07:45.554 --> 03:07:47.155
BACK ITS ENTERTAINER.

03:07:47.222 --> 03:07:49.024
IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE STENCH

03:07:49.091 --> 03:07:50.125
HAS CASE.

03:07:50.192 --> 03:07:51.827
BECAUSE SOMEONE ELSE SAYING THAT

03:07:51.893 --> 03:07:54.229
THE CAR WAS BROKEN INTO BECAUSE

03:07:54.296 --> 03:07:55.430
IT WAS LOCKED WOULD BE WHAT HER

03:07:55.497 --> 03:07:56.932
SAY IT'S HEARSAY.

03:07:56.999 --> 03:07:57.532
THAT'S WHY I CAN'T THAT'S WHY

03:07:57.599 --> 03:07:59.568
YOU FORCE INTEREST TO COME BACK

03:07:59.635 --> 03:08:00.268
TO TRIAL.

03:08:00.335 --> 03:08:02.170
THAT'S WHY THE CONSTITUTION AND

03:08:02.237 --> 03:08:04.573
THE LAW REQUIRES THAT THE

03:08:04.640 --> 03:08:06.174
TOURISTS COME BACK YES.

03:08:06.241 --> 03:08:08.210
AND THEN I'M JUST CURIOUS FROM A

03:08:08.276 --> 03:08:09.111
TOURISM.

03:08:09.177 --> 03:08:11.179
DEPARTMENT WHO WERE PUTTING

03:08:11.246 --> 03:08:13.081

03:08:19.521 --> 03:08:21.690
COULD BE A SUITCASE IN THE TRUNK.

03:08:21.757 --> 03:08:23.759
IT I'M JUST TRY TO INFORM TAURUS

TO NOT LEAVE ANYTHING IN THE CAR

03:08:26.428 --> 03:08:27.796

03:08:27.863 --> 03:08:29.965
YOU KNOW FULL OR A TOURIST CAR

03:08:30.032 --> 03:08:32.100

THE RENTAL CAR INDUSTRY TO

03:08:33.602 --> 03:08:35.203
MINIMIZE THE EFFECT.

03:08:35.270 --> 03:08:37.339
THE REALITY IS THAT -- YOU KNOW

03:08:37.406 --> 03:08:39.007

AND WE HAVE.

03:13:13.348 --> 03:13:15.216
APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND

03:13:15.283 --> 03:13:17.052
FIFTY DIFFERENT -- CONDUCT IN

03:13:17.118 --> 03:13:19.254
SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS AND THIS

03:13:19.321 --> 03:13:21.856
ONE THIS ONE YEAR ENHANCEMENT.

03:13:21.923 --> 03:13:23.625
FOR PRISON PRIORS IS ONE OF THE

03:13:23.692 --> 03:13:24.926
MOST COMMON -- I CALLED

03:13:24.993 --> 03:13:26.361
YESTERDAY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

03:13:26.428 --> 03:13:28.096
CORRECTIONS AND ACCORDING TO

03:13:28.163 --> 03:13:31.666
THEIR LATEST FIGURES THERE ARE

03:13:31.733 --> 03:13:32.267
FIFTEEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED

03:13:32.334 --> 03:13:34.502
AND TWENTY TWO INMATES WHO ARE

03:13:34.569 --> 03:13:35.937
CURRENTLY SERVING A SENTENCE.

03:13:36.004 --> 03:13:38.840
THAT INCLUDES AT LEAST.

03:13:38.907 --> 03:13:41.142
ONE OF THESE ENHANCEMENTS UNDER

03:13:41.209 --> 03:13:43.979
SIX SIX SEVEN POINT -- FIVE SO I

03:13:44.045 --> 03:13:46.081
CHECK LAST NIGHT IT'S WHO WE

03:13:46.147 --> 03:13:48.083
SPEND ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND

03:13:48.149 --> 03:13:49.718
DOLLARS TO INCARCERATED IN IN

03:13:49.784 --> 03:13:51.853
MADE FOR ONE YEAR.

03:13:51.920 --> 03:13:54.889
IN -- IN A PRISON SO THIS MEANS

03:13:54.956 --> 03:13:56.324
THAT THIS ENHANCEMENTS NOT CHEAP

03:13:56.391 --> 03:13:59.394
EITHER -- THAT WE ARE IF MY MATH

03:13:59.461 --> 03:14:00.328
IS RIGHT WE'RE CURRENTLY

03:14:00.395 --> 03:14:03.264
SPENDING ABOUT ONE POINT TWO

03:14:03.331 --> 03:14:06.201
THREE BILLION DOLLARS MAYBE MORE --

03:14:06.267 --> 03:14:08.236
ON THIS ENHANCEMENT SO THE

03:14:08.303 --> 03:14:10.205
QUESTION IS IS IT COST EFFECTIVE.

03:14:10.271 --> 03:14:12.974
AND I FEAR THAT IT IS NOT --

03:14:13.041 --> 03:14:15.643
EVERY DAY IS A PUBLIC DEFENDER I

03:14:15.710 --> 03:14:17.112
WATCHED PEOPLE GO TO PRISON.

03:14:17.178 --> 03:14:19.080
AND THEY TYPICALLY FALL INTO TWO

03:14:19.147 --> 03:14:21.916
CATEGORIES -- THE VAST MAJORITY

03:14:21.983 --> 03:14:23.718
ARE PEOPLE WHO BACK INTO

03:14:23.785 --> 03:14:24.586
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.

03:14:24.652 --> 03:14:27.789
BECAUSE OF MENTAL ILLNESS DRUG

03:14:27.856 --> 03:14:29.524
ADDICTION OR POVERTY -- BUT

03:14:29.591 --> 03:14:31.226
THERE ARE ALSO PEOPLE WHO HAVE

03:14:31.292 --> 03:14:34.229
CHOSEN CRIME IS THEIR PROFESSION.

03:14:34.295 --> 03:14:36.064
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A SMART

03:14:36.131 --> 03:14:38.233
COST EFFECTIVE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

03:14:38.299 --> 03:14:38.900
SYSTEM.

03:14:38.967 --> 03:14:40.869
STRIVES TO KEEP THE PEOPLE IN

03:14:40.935 --> 03:14:43.304
THE FIRST CATEGORY OUT OF PRISON.

03:14:43.371 --> 03:14:44.372
AND THE PEOPLE IN THE SECOND

03:14:44.439 --> 03:14:47.609
CATEGORY IN -- THE PROBLEM IS

03:14:47.675 --> 03:14:49.010
THAT THE ONE YEAR PRISON PRIOR

03:14:49.077 --> 03:14:50.678
ENHANCEMENT DOESN'T REALLY DO

03:14:50.745 --> 03:14:53.214
THAT IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY IT CAST

03:14:53.281 --> 03:14:55.550
THE NET TOO WIDE AND SCOOPS UP

03:14:55.617 --> 03:14:56.751
TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THAT FIRST

03:14:56.818 --> 03:14:57.819
CATEGORY.

03:14:57.886 --> 03:15:00.488
BECAUSE IT APPLIES TO ANY FELONY

03:15:00.555 --> 03:15:03.124
CONVICTION AT ALL -- IN AT THE

03:15:03.191 --> 03:15:05.860
SAME TIME I THINK IT IS ANOTHER

03:15:05.927 --> 03:15:07.262
STEP.

03:15:07.328 --> 03:15:09.631
IN TOWARD UNTANGLING THIS

03:15:09.697 --> 03:15:12.333
LABYRINTHINE -- CRIMINALS --

03:15:12.400 --> 03:15:16.137
SENTENCING SCHEME THAT WE HAVE --

03:15:16.204 --> 03:15:17.605
THIS THIS BILL IS NOT GOING TO

03:15:17.672 --> 03:15:20.241
SWING THE PRISON DOORS WIDE OPEN.

03:15:20.308 --> 03:15:22.143
IT IS NOT GONNA SEND RECIDIVISM

03:15:22.210 --> 03:15:24.212
RATES SOARING AND IT'S NOT GOING

03:15:24.279 --> 03:15:26.381
TO PREVENT JUDGES FROM STRICTLY

03:15:26.448 --> 03:15:28.650
PUNISHING SERIOUS OFFENDERS WHO

03:15:28.716 --> 03:15:30.418
COMMIT CRIMES OF VIOLENCE OR SEX.

03:15:30.485 --> 03:15:31.719
THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER

03:15:31.786 --> 03:15:34.089
ENHANCEMENTS TO DO THAT -- WHAT

03:15:34.155 --> 03:15:35.857
IT WILL DO IS TAKE A STEP IN THE

03:15:35.924 --> 03:15:38.726
RIGHT DIRECTION AND THAT'S WHY

03:15:38.793 --> 03:15:40.095
SUPPORT THANK YOU [inaudible]

03:15:49.337 --> 03:15:51.506

FOUR DOT COM.

03:16:15.997 --> 03:16:17.132

REMORSEFUL OF THE PAIN IN

03:16:26.040 --> 03:16:28.910

03:16:28.977 --> 03:16:30.578
WHILE IN JAIL THE CASE PENDING

03:16:30.645 --> 03:16:31.613

THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT.

03:21:21.302 --> 03:21:22.970
HOW TO DO THE SENTENCING THERE

03:21:23.037 --> 03:21:24.238
ARE NUMEROUS COURSES THEY TRY TO

03:21:24.305 --> 03:21:25.840
GIVE?

03:21:25.907 --> 03:21:27.408
OUR TWO JUDGES SO THAT WHEN THEY

ARE ASKED TO TWO SENTENCE PEOPLE --

03:21:31.078 --> 03:21:32.380

FOR A DRESSING THIS PROBLEM.

03:21:38.786 --> 03:21:40.421
THE HOPE WAS THE MORE WE PUNISH

03:21:40.488 --> 03:21:42.056
PEOPLE THE MORE THEY'LL CHANGE

03:21:42.123 --> 03:21:43.958
THEIR BEHAVIOR WE KNOW THAT

03:21:44.025 --> 03:21:45.660
HASN'T WORKED AND THIS WHOLE

03:21:45.726 --> 03:21:47.495
SYSTEM.

03:21:47.562 --> 03:21:50.465
HAS BEEN ALMOST AN EMBARRASSMENT

03:21:50.531 --> 03:21:52.500
I THINK TO THE COURTS AND TO OUR

03:21:52.567 --> 03:21:54.869
EFFORTS TO IMPROVE OUR CRIMINAL

03:21:54.936 --> 03:21:55.837
JUSTICE SYSTEM AND I JUST WANT

03:21:55.903 --> 03:21:58.206
TO SAY THAT BECAUSE I HAVE HAD

03:21:58.272 --> 03:21:59.841
MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH JUDGES

03:21:59.907 --> 03:22:03.211
WHO ARE -- TRULY VERY FRUSTRATED

03:22:03.277 --> 03:22:05.279
BY ALL THE ENHANCEMENTS AND THEN

03:22:05.346 --> 03:22:07.081
YOU DEDUCT FOR THIS AND YOUR

03:22:07.148 --> 03:22:10.117
SENTENCE WAS IN A AN EXAMPLE.

03:22:10.184 --> 03:22:12.720
OF OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE TRY

03:22:12.787 --> 03:22:13.955
TO FIGURE OUT A SYSTEM THAT IS

03:22:14.021 --> 03:22:15.990
INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND I BET THAT

03:22:16.057 --> 03:22:18.259
THIS WILL ALSO IF WE START CLERK

03:22:18.326 --> 03:22:19.827
CLEARING UP THIS PROCESS.

03:22:19.894 --> 03:22:21.028
IT WILL SAVE THE STATE AN

03:22:21.095 --> 03:22:23.164
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY BECAUSE

03:22:23.231 --> 03:22:24.232
I KNOW THERE INSTANCES WHERE

03:22:24.298 --> 03:22:26.100
PUBLIC DEFENDERS COME IN AND

03:22:26.167 --> 03:22:28.102
THEY CHALLENGES SENTENCING.

03:22:28.169 --> 03:22:30.438
DECISION SO WE CAN HELP.

03:22:30.505 --> 03:22:32.173
ONE THE CORDS -- TRY TO FIND

03:22:32.240 --> 03:22:33.541
BETTER WAYS TO ASSURE THAT

03:22:33.608 --> 03:22:35.643
PEOPLE WHO COMMIT OFFENSES DO

03:22:35.710 --> 03:22:38.079
NOT RECIDIVISTS -- AND THE

03:22:38.145 --> 03:22:40.147
CHANGING THIS IS JUST A SMALL

03:22:40.214 --> 03:22:42.450
BUT I THINK A SIGNIFICANT STEP

03:22:42.517 --> 03:22:45.219
FORWARD SO WITH THAT I ALSO

SUBJECT MATTER THAT WE SHOULD

03:22:54.262 --> 03:22:55.429
THINK ABOUT.

03:22:55.496 --> 03:22:59.367

ENTITY THAT WE COULD -- YOU KNOW

03:23:11.212 --> 03:23:13.514
