TRYING TO VISIT FAMILY IN SAINT LOUIS FOR THANKSGIVING ON NOVEMBER TWENTY FIRST. OF OF THIS LAST YEAR AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY FOUR. IN ADDITION TO THAT I RISE ON MY OWN BEHALF BECAUSE MISTER WHITE WAS A FRIEND. COLLEAGUES AND A MENTOR. HE WAS BORN IN DECEMBER NINETEEN NINETEEN THIRTY TWO IN LINCOLN NEBRASKA. AND WAS RAISED IN MINNEAPOLIS BY HIS MOTHER AFTER HIS FATHER AND MOTHER SEPARATED. AFTER GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL. AND HE WORKS VERY HARD BELIEVES IN HIGH SCHOOL AS THEY IN ONE OF THE HOTELS IS ONE OF THE PORTERS. BUT HE MADE HIS WAY TO CALIFORNIA ONCE AGAIN WORKING ON THE TRAINS TO EARN HIS WAY ACROSS TOWN ACROSS THE STATE'S. PUTIN SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY. HE EARNED HIS BACHELOR'S IN HIS MASTER'S FROM SAN FRANCISCO STATE. ENTER THE MILITARY INTO TWENTY FOUR YEARS AND THEN TWENTY FOUR MONTHS AND THEN WENT TO MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY. DOCTOR WHITEEARNED BIG EARNED A PHD IN PSYCHOLOGY AT MICHIGAN STATE IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE. HE WAS THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN TO EVER EARNS SUCH A DEGREE FROM MICHIGAN STATE. AND ONLY ONE OF FIVE IN THE NATION AT THAT TIME TO HELD A PHD IN PSYCHOLOGY. YOU CAME BACK TO CALIFORNIA HE TAUGHT AT CAL STATE LONG BEACH. HE ALSO FOUND OF THE EEL OUT YOUR PR PROGRAM THE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM TO HELP HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. TO GET AN EDUCATION. AND EVENTUALLY BECAME THE DEAN OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE. EXAMPLE CISCO SAY HE ALSO HELPED ESTABLISH THE BLACK STUDIES PROGRAM WAS THE FIRST WHICH WAS THE FIRST BLACK STUDIES PROGRAM IN THE NATION. AND IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT DOCTOR WHITE FOUNDED. CO FOUNDED THE ASSOCIATION OF BLACK PSYCHOLOGISTS THAT EXISTS TO THIS DAY. HE WAS WHAT WE CALL A. SCHOLAR ACTIVISTS. AND THOSE A FEW AND FAR BETWEEN. THOSE WHO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THEIR PROFESSION. WHO DO THE WORK WRITE THE ARTICLES AND MANY OF HIS ARTICLES WERE FOUNDATIONAL ARTICLES FOR THE TO STATUS MEANT OF THE FIELD OF BLACK PSYCHOLOGY? WE CHALLENGE WHITE PSYCHOLOGIST TO BASICALLY LOOK AT THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THE CULTURE ELEMENTS THAT EXISTED IN PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT INFLUENCE THE KINDS OF DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE ABOUT INTELLIGENCE AND OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES THAT THEY FELT. DOCTOR WHITE WAS ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF THAT ALONG WITH SO MANY OTHER BLACK PSYCHOLOGIST THE FEW THAT ACTUALLY STARTED THE BLACK PSYCHOLOGISTS ASSOCIATION. THAT EXISTS TO THIS DAY STRONGER THAN EVER STILL CHALLENGING AND WRITING AND DOING THOSE THINGS. HE AUTHORED THREE BOOKS THAT BAIT HIM BECOME WHAT WE CALL THE GODFATHER OF PSYCHOLOGY. HE ALONG WITH OTHERS WHO ARE AUTHORED THE BOOKS THAT BASICALLY TALKED ABOUT THE ISSUES OF BLACK PSYCHOLOGY AND CULTURE RELEVANCE IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF INDIVIDUALS. IT GROUNDBREAKING WORK ON AFRICAN AMERICAN MALES IN ISSUES OF RAGE IN AMERICA AND SO HE WAS REALLY ONE OF THE ACT THE SCHOLARS WHO DID THE WORK. BUT MOST IMPORTANT HE ALSO MENTORED HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS. THOSE STUDENTS TO LOOK TO HIM AS AN EXAMPLE BECAUSE HE AYE HE CONSTANTLY BATTLE THE INSTITUTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE IVORY TOWER REALLY WAS OPEN TO EVERY STUDENT. AND BASICALLY SUPPORTED ALL THE KINDS OF WORK THAT WE DID IN BLACK STUDIES AND CULTURE RELEVANCE INCOME CULTURE COMPETENCIES. THAT WAS DOCTOR WHITE. AND HE BECAME THE MENTOR TO SOLVE MANY YOUNG PEOPLE THAT I'D MEET EVERYWHERE WILL TALK ABOUT. WHAT HE DID FOR THEM TO HELP THEM GET INTO GRADUATE SCHOOL HOW WE HELP THEM WITH THEIR DOCTORAL WORK HOW HE GAVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THINGS THAT OTHERS DID NOT? EVEN AFTER HIS RETIREMENT. BUT CAL STATE IRVINE. HE CONTINUED IN TO WORK WITH SO MANY OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE IN SO MANY INSTITUTIONS AND BECAME A ROLE MODEL FOR ALL OF US WHO ARE FACULTY. TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE NOT ONLY JUST THE OPPORTUNITY TO TEACH BUT WE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY. TO BASICALLY BRING IN A NEW GENERATION OF SCHOLARS WHO LOOKED AT THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY WHO HELP TO THOSE IN NEED AND TO REPRESENT THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE DID REPRESENT. DOCTOR WHITES LEGACY LIVES IN HIS ABILITY NOT ONLY TO DO THE SCHOLARLY WORK. FIGHT THESE CHALLENGES OF RACISM THAT HE FOUGHT REGULARLY IN FACT HE OFTEN SAID THAT ONE OF THE THAT HE HAD. HE KNEW OF RACISM AND HAD EXPERIENCE OF SOME OF IT IN THE SOUTH. BUT WAS INTERESTING HE SAID THE BOOK HE'D NEVER EXPERIENCED THAT MUCH RACISM UNTIL HE BECAME A PHD. AND REALLY BEGIN TO CHALLENGE THE SYSTEM BECAUSE AT THAT POINT YOU HAVE THE TOOLS TO CHAO'S THE SYSTEM. AND WAS AT THAT POINT HE REALIZE OF RACISM. WHEN HE BECAME A PROFESSOR AT IRVINE TO CONFER EVER TO FIND A PLACE TO LIVE THERE'S NO ONE ONE TO RENT TO AN AFRICAN AMERICAN EVEN THOUGH HE WAS A PHD AFRICAN AMERICAN. BEING BROUGHT INTO THE INSTITUTION. SERVING IN LEADERSHIP CAPACITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. HE NEVER FORGOT FROM WHENCE HE CAME. I COULDN'T CONTINUE TO WORK ON BEHALF OF YOUNG PEOPLE EVERYWHERE. AND SO HE LEAVES US IN SOME WAY WITH SOME SADNESS SOME SADNESS OBVIOUSLY UP EIGHTY FOUR YEARS. BUT LISTEN REAL JOY THAT WE HAVE THE CHANCE OF NO DOCTOR JOSEPH WHITE. A MAN OF TREMENDOUS INTEGRITY AND LEADERSHIP WHO LOVE STUDENTS AND WAS A MASTER TEACHER HIS STUDENTS WOULD OFTEN TALK ABOUT HIM THE NIGHT HUMAN LECTURES AT NATIONAL CONFERENCES. WE REALLY WAS ABLE TO BREAK DOWN THE ISSUES AND HELP THE AVERAGE PERSON UNDERSTAND THE TREMENDOUS OF WEALTH OF IN KNOWLEDGE AND IN IN INTELLECT THAT THE HECK. HE LEAVES TO MOURN US AS ONE OF THESE PIONEERS TO OPEN THE DOOR AND I THINK THAT MOST OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE LOVE BLACK PSYCHOLOGISTS ASSOCIATION. ARE DECEASED EXCEPT FOR MAYBE ONE. HE WE SEND CONDOLENCES TO HIS FAMILY HE HE LEAVES TO MOURN HIS WIFE LOWERS HIS THREE DAUGHTERS LAURIE LISA AND LEóN AND EVEN HIS FORMER WIFE IS STILL A FRIEND MYRTLE. TO LEAVE THEM IN HIS MEMORY THEY THEY THEY THINK OF HIM AND THE INTERESTING THING IS A LARA BECAME A MEANT TO YOUR MIND WHEN SHE CAME SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY IS ONE OF THE WORKERS IN STUDENT AFFAIRS. AND DOES SHE MENTORS SO MUCH LIKE HER FATHER WORKING WITH PEOPLE EVERYWHEREAND HE WAS TRAVELING TO VISIT HER WHEN HE DIED HE SHE IS NOW THE VICE CHANCELLOR. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON ST LOUIS IN THE SAME KIND OF LEGACY AS HER FATHER. AFRICAN PROVERB ALWAYS TELLS US THAT. NO ONE EVER REALLY DIES. I WAS LOST UNTIL THE LAST PERSON ON EARTH.
