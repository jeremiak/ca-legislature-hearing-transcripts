CHILD WELFARE IS AN AREA WHERE WE SEE STARK HISTORICAL DISPARITIES BUT WE AREN'T NOW MORE EQUIPPED THAN EVER TO BUILD THE PREVENTION MUSCLE TO KEEP FAMILIES INTACT WHEN IT IS SAFE FOR CHILDREN.

A. M. WE WILL HOLD ALL MEMBERS QUESTIONS ON THIS PANEL UNTIL. AFTER ALL OF THE PRESENTERS HAVE CONCLUDED LET US BEGIN WITH DR DANIEL WEBSTER WELCOME PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY AGAIN WHAT STIR THE DIRECTOR OF THE CHILD WELFARE INDICATORS PROJECT AT UC BERKELEY WE HAVE A LONG STANDING PARTNERSHIP WITH GSS OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. TO PULL INFORMATION FROM THE STATE'S AUTOMATED CHAO WILL PERMISSION SYSTEM AND REPORT INDICATORS OF SYSTEM PERFORMANCE ON A PUBLIC WEBSITE TO SUPPORT THE STATE MANDATED OUTCOMES AND ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. I'VE BEEN OUT TO PROVIDE A BRIEF ORIENTATION ON DEFINITIONS OF DATA TRANSLATE THE RACIAL DISPROPORTIONATELY AND DISPARITIES IN CHILD WELFARE I BELIEVE YOU HAVE A POWER POINT FROM WHICH MY REMARKS ARE DRAWN DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS OFTEN CATHOLIC THE MAIN POINTS WITHOUT GOING TO THE INDIVIDUAL SLIDES SELF. DEFINITION PERSONALITY REFERS TO ONE. SAY CHILDREN FOSTER CARE. ACT OF PROPORTION THE LARGER. POPULATION OFF THIS COMPARE POP. IS THE- CHILD POPULATION SO FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY TWENTY BLACK CHILDREN ACCOUNTED 421% OF ALL CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE. BUT THEY MADE UP ONLY FIVE POINT 6% OF THE GENERAL CHILD POPULATION SO BLACK CHILDREN ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY. OVER REPRESENTED IN FOSTER CARE. WHITE CHILDREN BY CONTRAST ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 222% OF ALL CHILDREN FOSTER CARE BUT THEY MAKE UP. 31% OF THE GENERAL POPULATION SO WHY CHILDREN ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY UNDER REPRESENTED IN FOSTER CARE. JUST DISPARITY REFERS TO UNEQUAL TREATMENT OUTCOMES FOR DIFFERENT GROUPS IN THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES OR AT THE SAME DECISION POINT IN OUR SYSTEM SO IN INEQUALITY BETWEEN THE RATE OF PLACE IN THE FOSTER CARE FOR CHILDREN. OF DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUPS WOULD BE A DISPARITY IN ENTRY RIGHT. THE TRENDS. FOR THESE DISPARITIES ARE REPRESENTED IN THE FORM OF RATIOS THERE A SUMMARY MEASURE BY WHICH WE CAN HELP SHOW THE DEGREE OF THIS INEQUALITY AT DIFFERENT DECISION POINTS ALONG THE CHAO WALKER COULD CHANGE. BASICALLY WE COMPARE THE RATE AT A GIVEN DECISION POINT OF ONE GROUP WITH ANOTHER SO FOR EXAMPLE. IN TWENTY TWENTY BLACK CHILDREN ENTERED FOSTER CARE AT A RATE OF ABOUT EIGHT POINT SEVEN PER THOUSAND. WHILE WHITE CHILDREN ENTERED FOSTER CARE RATE ABOUT TWO POINT ONE PER THOUSAND SO THE BLACK WHITE DISPARITY RATIO FOR ENTRIES. WOULD BE THE EIGHT POINT SEVEN DIVIDED BY THE TWO POINT ONE GIVING US A COLLECTION OF ABOUT ADJUSTABLE CORD THAT IS TO SAY. BLACK CHILDREN WERE ABOUT FOUR TIMES AS LIKELY AS WHITE CHILDREN ENTER FOSTER CARE. IN TWENTY TWENTY. THE RATIOS FOR. TO FOR OF KERR WITH THE WHAT FIRST SHALL BLACK AND DATA AMERICAN. CHILDREN ARE ALMOST TO FIVE TIMES OF LIKE AS WHITE. COULD BE AMONG THOSE CLIENTS OF THE TRIAL WELFARE TO. WHAT NEXT CHILDREN ARE SLIGHTLY LIKE THAN WHITE AND A- OVER BELIEVED. WHEN THE TOM POPPY AND USE OF THE REFERENCE AT RISK. THESE RACIAL DISPARITIES ARE ROBOTS THAT HAVE BEEN NOTED AS LONG AS WE'VE BEEN TRACKING DATA YEAH. MANY RESEARCHERS AND STAKEHOLDERS HAVE RIGHTLY POINTED OUT THAT POVERTY IS A CRITICAL FACTOR THAT COULD INFLUENCE CHILDREN FAMILY CONTACT WITH CHILD WELFARE. SHOWS THE STEP IN THE DIRECTION OF TAKING POVERTY NO CAP IN THE CALCULATION OF DISPARITY RATIOS WITH BERKELEY HAVE USED THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY. TO GENERATE DISPARITY RATIOS THAT ARE BASED OFF POPULATION APOP YES AND IT'S BASICALLY WE USE THE ACS ESTIMATES. TO CHOP THE UNDERLYING REFERENCE POPULATION FROM THE GENERAL CHILD POPULATION. TO THE SHOP ELECTION OF POVERTY AND WE DO THAT WE FIND TO THE DEGREE OF RACIAL DISPARITY. DECREASES BETWEEN SOME GROUPS BLACK TODAY AMERICAN FOR EXAMPLE IN POPPY ARE STILL MORE LIKELY TO BE SUBSTANTIATED REMOVED AND BEING CARE AND FOSTER CARE THAN WHITE CHILDREN HOBBY BUT THE MAGNITUDE AS LAST AND- LIST YET. WHEN YOU USE THE GENERAL POPULATION OF THE OF THE REFERENCE POINT ALSO IN SOME CASES THE TRENDS REVERSE WHY CHILDREN POVERTY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE REFERRED. THAN BLACK. OR NATIVE AMERICANS ON THE PROPERTY AND WHAT NEXT CHILDREN IN POVERTY ARE NOTABLY LESS LIKELY THAN WHITES. TO BE AMONG CHILDREN AT EVERY CHILD OFFER CONTACTLESS. ALSO LOG TALKED SOME DISPARITIES WITH RESPECT TO ETHNIC GROUPS IT BEARS NOTING THAT OTHER GROUP SHOULD BE RECOGNISED. IN DISCUSSIONS OF MORE EQUITABLE SERVICE DELIVERY FOR EXAMPLE CHILDREN WHO ARE LGBTQ OR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES OR SPECIAL HEALTHCARE NEEDS STATUS. FOR ALL OF OUR EFFORTS TO AMELIORATE LONGSTANDING DISPARITIES WE NEED BETTER DATA. BOTH QUANTITATIVE DATA AND ONGOING LINKAGES ACROSS SERVICE SYSTEMS AS WELL AS QUALITATIVE. DATA TO PROVIDE CRITICAL INSIGHT YOUR CLIMB RESPECT. ON THE WORK THAT WE DO. THANKS VERY MUCH. THANK YOU DR NEXT WE WILL FROM FORTE DIRECTOR PAUL AND LITIGATION. FOR THE ALLIES FOR RIGHTS PLEASE BEGIN. AFTERNOON THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS AND STAFF FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY I'M SABRINA FORTE FROM THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS THE ALLIANCE ADVANCES THE RIGHTS OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH IMPACTED BY THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM HE LEGAL AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND POLICY ADVOCACY. LAST YEAR THE ALLIANCE AND OUR CHILD WELFARE ADVOCACY PARTNERS HOSTED A SUMMIT TO DISCUSS THE ROOT CAUSES OF AND POSSESS POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS FOR THE DISPROPORTIONATE REPRESENTATION OF BLACK AND NATIVE AMERICAN FAMILIES AND CALIFORNIA'S FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. DO THIS SUMMIT AND ONGOING ENGAGEMENT WITH ADVOCATES CHILD WELFARE AGENCY STAFF SERVICE PROVIDERS AND PEOPLE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE SYSTEM WE PUBLISHED A REPORT LAST YEAR ENTITLED THE PATH TO RACIAL EQUITY IN CHILD WELFARE VALUING FAMILY AND COMMUNITY. IT CONTAINS OVER A DOZEN RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REFORM THAT FALL INTO FOUR MAIN AREAS I'M GOING TO BE VERY SUBSTANTIALLY SUMMARIZE THEM HERE IN THE TIME ALLOTTED. FIRST VALUING FAMILY AND COMMUNITY THROUGH PREVENTION STRATEGY IS AIMED AT AVERTING MALTREATMENT AND HALTING UNNECESSARY FAMILY SEPARATIONS. AMYLASE HOPE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING CONDITIONS THAT PUT THEM AT A HIGHER MAGNITUDE OF RISK FOR CHILD WELFARE INVOLVEMENT POVERTY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOUSING SECURITY FOOD INSECURITY AND CHALLENGES RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE. NEED TO BE ABLE TO SEE CRISP THAT SUPPORT THAT IS RESPONSIVE TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN TRAUMATIZED BY THEIR EXPERIENCES CALLING NINE ONE ONE FOR HELP HAVE LEARNED NOT TO SEEK HELP FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT OR OTHER SYSTEMS THAT ARE PERCEIVED AS LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF BUILDING A STRONGER ARRAY OF REMOTE AND MOBILE CRISIS RESPONSE SERVICES THAT THAT DISPATCH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT TO SUPPORT A FAMILY IN CRISIS AND THE SERVICES HAD THE LOWEST POSSIBLE BARRIER TO ENTRY. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THE EXPANSION OF THE FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM TO SERVE A BROADER POPULATION INCLUDING FAMILIES THAT DON'T HAVE A CHILD WELFARE HISTORY. AT AND ALLOWING FOR THE GROWTH OF SUCH A PROGRAM WOULD ALLOW FAMILIES TO NOT HAVE TO BE AND FOSTER CARE IN ORDER TO GET HELP AND ALLOW FOR TRUE PREVENTION. THE SECOND AREA OF RECOMMENDATIONS INVOLVE ADDRESSING THE POWER IMBALANCE BETWEEN FAMILIES AND THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM THIS WAS IDENTIFIED BY AND FAMILIES WITH. WITH DIRECT EXPERIENCE OF IN THE SYSTEM AS A MAJOR OBSTACLE. WE'VE HEARD REPEATEDLY AND RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT ADEQUATE LEGAL REPRESENTATION IS ESSENTIAL TO WRITING THIS POWER IMBALANCE AND TO REDUCING THE RACIALLY DISPARATE OUTCOMES FOR FAMILIES IN THE SYSTEM. BUT THESE DISPARITIES BEGIN WELL BEFORE THE FAMILY APPEARS IN COURT AND GET APPOINTED COUNSEL AND SO WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT THE STATE INVEST IN LEGAL REPRESENTATION BEFORE A PETITION IS FILED AT THE MOMENT THE CHILD WELFARE AGENCY HAS MADE THE DECISION TO SEPARATE. A CHILD FROM THEIR PARENTS AND WE SUPPORT HOLISTIC PRE PETITION LEGAL REPRESENTATION THAT INCLUDES ATTORNEYS WITH EXPERTISE AND DEPENDENCY LAW OF COURSE BUT ALSO ADVOCATES. WHO CAN PROVIDE CIVIL LEGAL AID TO ADDRESS THE FAMILIES UNDERLYING NEEDS. THIRD WE RECOMMEND STRATEGIES TO EMPOWER THE FAMILY NETWORK AND CONNECT YOU TO THEIR COMMUNITIES IF REMOVAL IS NECESSARY. ALTHOUGH WE KNOW THE EVIDENCE ON KINSHIP CARE YOU KNOW THAT IT IMPROVES EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THE KEEP SIBLINGS TOGETHER. ONE OF THE MOST SELF EVIDENT BENEFITS TO KINSHIP CARE AS THAT ALLOWS A CHILD TO STAY CLOSE TO THEIR COMMUNITY THEIR CULTURE AND THEIR IDENTITY. WE'RE EXCITED TO PARTNER WITH DSS ON ROBUST IMPLEMENTATION OF LEGISLATION FROM LAST YEAR THAT REMOVED BARRIERS RELATED TO CRIMINAL HISTORY AND CAPACITY THAT PREVENTS RELATIVES AND DISPROPORTIONATELY BLACK WHAT THE NEXT A NATIVE AMERICAN RELATIVES- IN COMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM. FROM BECOMING A RESOURCE PARENTS AND SUPPORT MORE UP FRONT FAMILY FINDING AND ENGAGEMENTS TO MAINTAIN FAMILY CONNECTIONS AND EXPANSION OF THE EMERGENCY CHILD CARE BRIDGE PROGRAM TO FACILITATE EARLY PLACEMENTS WITH RELATIVES. LASTLY AND RELATEDLY IT'S CRITICAL TO PRIORITIZE FAMILY AND COMMUNITY CENTERED PATHWAYS TO REUNIFICATION AND PERMANENCY WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF REFORMS AND INVESTMENTS THAT SUPPORT FAMILIES PREFERRED PERMANENCY ARRANGEMENTS. ALTHOUGH CALIFORNIA HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS TO ENSURE PARITY FOR RELATIVE CAREGIVERS WHO ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE OLDER WOMEN OF COLOR WITH FIXED INCOMES CARING FOR CHILDREN OF COLOR. AT ALL STAGES OF THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM A FEW GAPS DO REMAIN. WE SUPPORT GIVING JUVENILE COURTS MORE FLEXIBILITY TO ORDER GUARDIANSHIP WITH THE INDIVIDUAL OF THE FAMILY'S CHOICE RATHER THAN ORDER THE CHILD INTO FOSTER CARE. AND THIS CAN ONLY HAPPEN IF THE- PROPOSED CAN GAP PROGRAM EXPANSION TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THESE EARLY OFFRAMP UNDER THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. ARE IMPLEMENTED. A SYSTEM THAT REQUIRES A CHILD TO BE IN CARE FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME IN ORDER TO RECEIVE A ONGOING PERMANENCY FIFTEEN UNDERCUTS THE BROADER SYSTEMIC GOAL OF TAILORING A FAMILY CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND TIMELINES. I KNOW THAT I MET TIME AND THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO SAY ABOUT THESE VERY RICH QUESTIONS BUT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE ALLIANCE'S REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM STACY LEAD CHIEF LEARNING OFFICER. AND DIRECTOR OF EARLY CHILDHOOD WITH CHILDREN NOW AND I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BUDGET CHAIR FOLDING. HAS JOINED OUR HEARING HERE TODAY. PLEASE BEGIN MISLI. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBER OF THIS CAN I'M STACEY LEAVITT CHIEF LEARNING OFFICER AND SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD WITH CHILDREN NOW THE CHILL OF CHILDREN'S RESEARCH POLICY AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON BUILDING POWER FOR KIDS THERE TO TWENTY SIX ACROSS EDUCATION HEALTH AND CHILD WELFARE IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION NINTENDO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK AT THE POPULATION OF YOUNG CHILDREN IN OUR STATE. CALIFORNIA IS THE NATION'S MOST POPULOUS STATE. TWO POINT THREE MILLION CHILDREN AGES ZERO TO FOR MORE THAN THE TOTAL POPULATION OF FIFTEEN STATES. ARE LIVING ALONE CAN HOUSEHOLDS. WE'VE THE MOST CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY IN THE NATION. CALIFORNIA IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE STATE IN WHICH TO RAISE A CHILD. FAMILIES OF COLOR ARE OVER REPRESENTED IN LOWER INCOME. LEVELS TO THE LAYERS OF SYSTEMIC DISCRIMINATION INCLUDING DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO JOBS THAT PAY A LIVING WAGE. BACK OF ACCESS TO QUALITY SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE ANY BLACK THE QUALITY. GEN EXCLUSIONARY IMMIGRATION POLICIES AREAS TO EQUITABLE HOUSING AND DISCRIMINATORY CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICIES. THAT MAKE EXACERBATING THE NIGHT BUT HE AS MANY AS ONE AND FAMILIES REPORTED. PAYING FOR BASIC NEEDS LIKE FOOD HOUSING AND UTILITIES WELL ROUGHLY HALF OF LOW INCOME BLACK AND LATINO FAMILIES REPORTED CHALLENGES IN THESE AREAS. A NATIONAL SURVEY DESIGNED TO GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT EARLY CHILDHOOD FAMILY WELL BEING DURING THE PANDEMIC SHOWED THAT IT INCREASED MATERIAL HARDSHIP CORRELATES WITH GREATER EMOTIONAL DISTRESS FOR CAREGIVERS AND FAMILY. ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR CARING FOR A BABY DOES NOT INCREDIBLY HARD THAT CAN BE WHOEVER YOU ARE. BUT IF YOU'RE ALSO NOT SURE WHERE YOU WILL SLEEP AT NIGHT WHEN YOU WILL GET A PAYCHECK NEXT MONTH. HAVE ENOUGH TO. EXPERIENCE TRAUMA AND- NOBODY TO TALK TO FOR SUPPORT IT CAN QUICKLY BECOME A CRISIS. HELPING FAMILIES HELP KIDS. WELL AS YOU CAN PROGRAMS THAT JUST MOMENTARY EVIDENCE BASED HOME VISITING. FAMILY LEAVE AND INCOME ASSISTANCE ARE EFFECTIVE COST EFFECTIVE INVESTMENT. CALIFORNIA'S MAKING STRIDES IN REACHING FAMILIES THROUGH THE SUPPORT OF PROGRAMS THERE ARE STILL FAR TOO MANY FAMILIES WHO MAY WANT ADDITIONAL HELP BUT AREN'T GETTING IT. CHILDREN NOW TWENTY TWENTY TWO CALIFORNIA REPORT CARD IF STATE LEADERS EPLUS FOR CHILDCARE SB MINUS IN VOLUNTARY HOME VISITING. A SIMPLE. EMILY AND EVEN TODD WELFARE CATEGORIES. NATIONAL RANKINGS IN THESE AREAS ALSO SHOW CALIFORNIA FAR BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OFTEN IN THE BOTTOM QUARTILE FOR INVESTMENTS IN EARLY CHILDHOOD SYSTEM. IN MOST OF THESE CATEGORIES IT IS NOT THAT WE'RE NOT DOING GOOD THINGS BUT WE ARE SIMPLY NOT INVESTING ENOUGH AT A BIG ENOUGH SCALE TO MAKE AN IMPACT AT THE POPULATION LEVEL. CALIFORNIA IS CURRENTLY SERVING UNDER 2% OF THE POPULATION WHO MIGHT BENEFIT FROM HOME VISITING PROGRAMS. EVIDENCE BASED HOME VISITING MODELS HAVE DECADES OF RESEARCH SHOWING THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT TYPE TWO GENERATIONS SUPPORT. PREGNANT AND PARENTING FAMILIES WITH INFANTS AND TODDLERS MEET. HOME VISITORS ARE TRAINED ON CULTURAL COMPETENCY AND IMPLICIT BIAS. TRYING TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS FOCUS ON STRENGTHENING SKILL BUILDING TO LISTEN TO THE NEEDS AND ASPIRATIONS OF PARENTS. IDENTIFIED REINFORCE CULTURAL CULTURAL PRACTICES AND PARENTING THANK REFERRAL AND SUPPORT THEIR CLIENTS TO SIX FEET OVER THE SPAN OF TWO YEARS OR MORE. THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE BENEFITS OF EVIDENCE BASED HOME VISITING LAST A LIFETIME. FOR THE CHILD AND PARENT. ECLIPTIC POWERED HOMEBUILDING PROGRAM FOR EACH P. THE PENTAGON DIFFERENT IT'S- DIVERTED STOP AND POP HEALTH EACH FOR ACTIVITIES OFTEN BUT BEAT AT SUPPORT INCUMBENT. THIS LED TO A SIX SLOWDOWN IN ENROLLMENT OUTREACH FOR NEW FAMILY THE GOOD NEWS IS FAMILIES INVOLVED IN SPEAKING IN PROGRAM IN THE RECENT ABOUT OF FOR THE ATP THERE WERE OVER TWO SIX SERVICES FAMILIES WERE THIRTY. MOST FREQUENT WERE FOR THE CHURCH OKAY HOW SUPPORT AND MENTAL SERVICES. OF THOSE REFERRED SERVICES SIXTY TO NINETY OR MORE ACTS THEM OVER THE OTHERS THE OF CONNECT TO HELP ENSURE WE ARE MAX AND THE REESE ALL IN PLAY FOR FAMILY AND IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. AS WE MAKE OUR WAY TO FINDING A NEW NORMAL IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO RAIN GAUGE OR AGENCY COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND ALL THE FAMILIES IN THE PRAYER BOOK OPENING PROGRAMS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE NEED TO ENSURE ALL ELIGIBLE FAMILIES ARE AWARE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN OFFERED OPPORTUNITIES TO ADULTS WE MUST ALSO ENSURE PROVIDERS REFLECT THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE AT THE WORKFORCE IS TRAINED IN ANTI RACISTSERVICE DELIVERY AND UNDERSTAND THE PARTICULAR AREAS BLACK WOMEN FACE AND HEALTHCARE AND OTHER SYSTEMS. CULTURALLY ALIGNED PARTS AND LANGUAGE ACCESSIBILITY PRIORITIZE THAT WE MONITORED TO FOUND FROM BLACK BROWN RIGHT IMMIGRANT AND MIGRANT POPULATIONS AREN'T BOTH SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM KIM JONG WITH THE CAL DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL. PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU JERRY GOOD AFTERNOON KIM JONG AT KALKA DEPARTMENT SOCIAL TO I JUST WANTED NAY IN A- THE FOCUS THIS AND- IS AFTER. AND COMMITTEE TO COULD OUR WORK TOGETHER TO REDUCE AND ELIMINATE THESE DISPARITIES WAS IT EXIST ACROSS OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM IN CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO ECHO IT APPRECIATE YOUR NOTE ABOUT STRENGTHENING OUR PREVENTION BASSIL. I THINK THAT FORMER FEDERAL LEADER AT WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION CHILDREN FAMILIES THAT THIS WELL POVERTY IS A RISK FACTOR FOR NEGLECT BUT POVERTY DOES NOT EQUATE TO NEGLECT THAT PRESENTS THE POVERTY ALONE DOES NOT MEAN A CHILD IS AND SAFE AND LOVED OR THAT A PARENT LACKS THE CAPACITY TO CARE FOR HIS OR HER CHILD. POVERTY CAN MAKEIT MORE CHALLENGING FOR PARENTS TO MEET CERTAIN. AT THE NEEDS OF THEIR CHILDREN BUT WE MUST BE REASONABLE CARE THAT THE CHILD SHOULD NEVER BE REMOVED FROM HIS OR HER HER. HOME DUE TO POVERTY ALONE OR THEIR HOME SEPT ONE AT LIFT THAT UP AND CERTAINLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND THAT AT ROBUST DIALOGUE IN THE AGENDA THAT'S INCLUDED HERE. FOUR AT THE QUESTIONS IN THE AGENDA AND HOW DO THESE WEIRD PERSON TURNED IT OVER TO OUR CHIEF DEPUTY ACTUALLY MET AT THE DIRECTOR SHORTS IN JUST A MOMENT TO SPEAK MORE AND CHILD WELFARE SPACE NOT TOUCH ON A FEW ITEMS I WANTED TO START WITH OUR OVER ARCHING PRINCIPLE OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. FOCUSED ON EQUITY WHICH REALLY SPEAKS TO OUR ABILITY TO CREATE A STATE FOR ALL OF US HAVE A CHANCE TO THRIVE BASED ON OUR EFFORTS AND HARD WORK. WE CANNOT ALLOW CERTAIN GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS TO BE DISADVANTAGED BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN GENDER IDENTITY SEXUAL ORIENTATION AGE OR DISABILITY AND ADD NOTING THAT WE WILL SEEK TO LIFT ALL BOATS BUT SOME FOLKS NEED TO BE LIFTED MORE. OVERARCHING OUR GOAL IS TO JUST ABOUT POVERTY BY PROVIDING STRENGTH BASED SERVICES AND RESOURCES THAT TANGIBLY ADDRESS THESE INEQUITIES AND I'LL GO THROUGH SOME OF THOSE EXAMPLES IN JUST A MOMENT BUT I'LL START FIRST WITH ASK THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM DESIGNED THE POLICY DEVELOPMENTS THE DELIVERY OF THOSE SERVICES AND WANT TO. I JUST AGAIN I'VE SPOKEN. TO THIS ACTIVIST COMMITTEE ON A PATH. ONE OF THE FIRST. AT I DID COMING INTO THE- OVER TO YOUR AGO NOW. WAS THE ESTABLISH. OF OFFICE OF EQUITY. REALLY REFER. THE PART MISSION WHICH CALL ON US TO. EIGHT PROTECT MEDIA PER. CHILDREN AND ADULTS. TO DO THAT OF. LESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF THEIR PROPERTY AND SOCIAL VULNERABILITY. AND ALSO EXAMINED THE UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH AND POWER. I WE HAVE BEEN WORKING OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS- AND I APPRECIATE OUR LEADER IN THIS SPACE AT THE DIRECTOR OF OFFICE OF ACNE MARCELLA LEADS TO REALLY IN BAD. EQUITY AND ENGAGEMENT PRINCIPLES THROUGHOUT. THE DEPARTMENT. REALLY ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THE COMPETENCIES IN CAPACITY. AS WE ARE ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES AND THE POWER THAT WE HAVE IN THAT GAME DESIGN THOSE PROGRAMS AND POLICIES TO DO JUST THAT. IN SOME CASES THAT MEANS ACTUALLY I'M DOING POLICIES THAT ARE CONTINUING THOSE DISPARITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY. AND OTHER EXAMPLES IT'S ABOUT THE HOW YOU'RE APPROACHING OUR WORK WORKING HOW YOUR PRODUCT PRIORITIZING IT. SO AS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT I WANT TO LIFT UP OUR OFFICE OF TRIBAL AFFAIRS THAT HAD WAS ESTABLISHED PRIOR TO MY COMING INTO THIS ROLE. I WHICH REALLY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BUILDING BETTER GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIPS WITH BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT. OF CALIFORNIA INDIAN TRIBES COUNTY TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. AS WELL AS OTHER NATIVE AMERICANS STAKEHOLDERS PART OF THAT MEETING CORE CHARGE OF THAT OFFICE IS AROUND THE IMPLEMENTATION AND THE INDIAN CHILD WELFARE ACT. WHICH WAS ENACTED AFTER NATIVE AMERICAN CHILDREN WERE SYSTEMICALLY REMOVED OFTEN WITHOUT EVIDENCE OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT. THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED GROUNDS FOR REMOVAL AND PLACED WITH NON NATIVE FAMILIES AND SO AGAIN. OUR LINE CALIFORNIA TOGETHER WE HAVE CONFIRMED THAT DOZEN INDIAN CHILD'S BEST INTEREST TO ENHANCE AND PROTECT THE CHILD CONNECTIONS TO THEIR TRIBE AND TRIBAL COMMUNITY. AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF THAT FEDERAL LAW. AS WAS REFERENCE JUST THAT RAP PRICE MISLI BEFORE. AT THIS ESTATE BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AT AND- ADAM THIS LET. I HAS DONE AND THAT AT AND NEVER OF THINGS IN TERMS OF AREN'T. IN OUR APP POLICY. AT THAT YET HAD PAID FAMILY WAS MEANT WE'VE- THE- TURN INCOME TAX CREDIT ALSO IN THAT SPACE. AT THE TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE THAT THE FEDERAL CHILD TAX CREDIT MADE- ON AT FAMILIES AT INCOME AND THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE ENDS MEET. OF COURSE A LOT OF INVESTMENT AND CONTINUING TO STRENGTHEN OUR QUALITY CHILD CARE DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM UNDERSTANDING AND RECOGNIZING THE OPPORTUNITY THAT GIVES CHILDREN NOT ONLY IN THE SHORT TERM BUT ALSO IN THE LONG RUN. I WE SPOKE TO THIS COMMITTEE PRIVATE PREVIOUSLY ABOUT THE INVESTMENTS WE'VE MADE TOGETHER TO FIND THE GUARANTEED INCOME PILOT PROJECT TO PROVIDE UNCONDITIONAL INDIVIDUAL REGULAR CASH PAYMENTS INTENDED TO SUPPORT. THE BASIC NEEDS EVERY STEP DANCING HOW LEARNING HOW. HEARING THIS WITH OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NET RESOURCES PRODUCES BETTER OUTCOMES FOR FAMILIES. WE'VE ALSO DONE THINGS LIKE THAT HOW WORKS OUT COMES ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW INITIATIVE REALLY IN RECOGNITION THAT WHAT WE WANT FOR OUR PROGRAMS IS MORE. THAN JUST- EQUATING TO THE NUMBER OF HOURS THAT I PARTICIPATE WORKS BUT REALLY LOOKING AT FAMILY AND CHILD WELL BEING OF THE FAMILIES PARTICIPATING CALPERS HOW THEY'RE ACCESSING. AND HOW THE SERVICES ARE DELIVERED HOW THEY'RE ENGAGING WITH THE PROGRAM. HOW THEY ARE GETTING RESOURCE ISN'T CONNECTED TO. YOUR MOBILE. IN ADDITION. AND AGAIN WHEN I APPRECIATE THE CHURCH LEADERSHIP WE HAVE EVERY MINUTE IN OPERATIONALIZE AS WAS MENTIONED INVOLUNTARY STRENGTH BASED HOME VISITING PROGRAM AND CAL WORKS REALLY LOOKING TO SUPPORT POSITIVE HEALTH DEVELOPMENT WELL BEING OUTCOMES. FOR PREGNANT PARENTING PEOPLE FAMILIES IN INFANTS BORN INTO POVERTY EXPANDING THEIR FUTURE EDUCATIONAL ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CAPABILITY OPPORTUNITIES. IN IMPROVING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WILL EXCEPT PROPERTY THAT INITIATIVE WILL DESIGNED VERY SPECIFICALLY. I IN MIND WITH THE LIKE WE WANT TO THAT. OF THE VISITORS THAT BE CULTURAL LANGUAGE BUT I. AS YOUR AGENDA POINTS. THEIR ROLE AS MAY REPORTERS ARE THEY- THAT THE- OF RESOURCE IS AT A WAY IN WHICH YOU'RE CONNECTING TO THE RESOURCE. I AM HELPING THOSE FAMILIES BECOME STABLE. ARE WE ACTUALLY PROVIDE ALLOWANCES THE MAC PROGRAM AS WE DO TODAY TO ALLOW THE HOME VISITOR TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH THOSE FAMILIES TO ADDRESS IMMEDIATE NEEDS. AT A GIVEN THE REFERRALS THAT WE SEEM TO DATE HAVE BEEN AT AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS FOR FUTURE FOOD SECURITY FOR ACCESSING MATERIAL GOODS LIKE CAR SEATS CRIBS AND OTHER ESSENTIAL ITEMS AFTERNOON. AT PARENTS SO AGAIN WANTED JUST RECOGNIZE THE INTENTION BEHIND THE DESIGN OF THAT INITIATIVE OUR CONNECTIONS TO HIDE THE CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT AGAIN OUR INTEGRATED IN THIS INITIATIVE AS WELL AS OUR CONNECTION TO IMMIGRATION LEGAL SERVICES WHICH WE NOW. PROVIDE TOO GREAT A TRAJECTORY OF GOOD OUTCOMES FOR FAMILIES IN OUR CALIFORNIANS SO I LIFT THAT UP AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE ARE ADDRESSING YEAH DISPARITIES. I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT IN CAL THE WORKS THAT'S THE QUESTION ASKED WE DOWN IN A LOT OVER THE COURSE OF. THE LAST. PROGRESSED AND HOW WE'RE LOOKING AT FAMILYREUNIFICATION POLICIES AND CAL WORKS EVERYTHING FROM OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO- WE IDENTIFIED AND ALLOW FOR THE CONTINUATION OF CAL WORKS WELFARE TO WORK SERVICES BUT ALSO LAUNCHING THINGS LIKE BRINGING FAMILIES HOME DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. EXPERIENCING ART RISK OF HOMELESSNESS TO INCREASE FAMILY REUNIFICATION AND TO PREVENT FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT HOWARD'S HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM HOSTED SYSTEMS AGAIN LOOKING AT MEETING THE NEEDS. AB CURRENCY OUR PARTY IN CAL. AND THEN A COURSE MOST RECENTLY. AT BEGINNING JOE OF THIS YEAR. IN THE FAMILY AT WHAT IT CHILD WORKERS ARE CORE ORDERED READ. PLANS MAKE LG TO COULD RISK. THAT THE SUPPORTS AND SERVICES THAT WILL HELP THEM GAIN NEXT ABILITY TO ACT SURE THAT REUNIFICATION IS SUCCESSFUL. AND ALSO NOTED IN THIS SPACE AND CAL WORKS THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE MOST RECENTLY GOT TOGETHER I'M IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING FOR THE STAFF AGAIN WORKING WITH FAMILIES. FINALLY I JUST WANT TO LIFT UP A PROJECT THAT WAS KNOWN AS THE LINKAGES WHICH WAS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE CAO WORKS AND CHILD WELFARE SERVICES TO PROMOTE YOUR CASE MANAGEMENT. AGAIN OF FAMILY REUNIFICATION ENSURING THAT WE WERE HAVING CONFLICTING LAWS- THAT WERE IN THE- MIDST IN ASKING AT THOSE THE FAMILIES AND WE'VE HAD. TREMENDOUS SUCCESS WITH THAT INITIATIVE OVER OVER TIME AND THE INVESTMENT IN THE DOLLARS HAVE TO HAVE- VARIED OVER TIME BUT WE ARE IN JUST ACTUALLY THIS WEEK HAVE WATCHED LINKAGES TO POINT OUT. AT TO REALLY LOOK AT A NEW EMPHASIS ON THIS PREVENTION FRAMEWORK IN THE SPACE. SO I GET A LOT. IN THE GIVEN THE TIME A LOT OF THOSE ARE SOME OF ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS EXAMPLES BUT OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO HERE. WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR COMPETENCIES AND ABILITY DESIGNED THESE PROGRAMS AND POLICIES TO RACIAL. EQUITY LANCE AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK ON. I'LL NOW TURN IT OVER TO OUR TECHNICAL RECTOR AND HE STARTS TO SAY MORE ABOUT YOUR SECOND QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT. IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. GOOD AFTERNOON AROUND ON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME DANCE IS FOR IT BUT THE DIRECTOR THE CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES DIVISION. I WANT TO START BY ECHOING THE APPRECIATION OF THE INCLUSION OF THE PANEL IN TODAY'S HEARING. AND THE RICH DISCUSSION TODAY. I TRACTOR JOHNSON STATED THE FOCUS ON RACIAL EQUITY AND ADDRESSING THE DISPARITY AND THE PROPORTIONALITY WITHIN OUR SYSTEM IS AT THE CORE OF ALL THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING. AND OUR MANY INITIATIVES AND PROJECTS UNDER WAY THAT ADDRESS THESE DISPARITIES AND PROMOTE RACIAL EQUITY- HIGHLIGHTED KEOGH. FIRST WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF. A EQUIPPED STATE. WHICH WILL ENSURE. OF THE INDIAN CHILD WELFARE ACT WITH GREATER FIDELITY ACROSS THE STATE AND ENSURE THAT OUR TRAVEL YOU. REMAIN CONNECTED TO THEIR FAMILIES CULTURES AND COMMUNITIES. I CAN'T I CALIFORNIA CHILD WELFARE REGIONAL TRAINING ACADEMIES WHICH LEADS HEALTH WELFARE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS AROUND THE STATE. HAVE DEVELOPED AN OFFER COURSES FOCUSED ON RACIAL EQUITY DISPROPORTIONATELY AND IMPLICIT BIAS FROM THE TOP SYSTEM INCLUDING NOW HOW TO CONCRETE LEE ADDRESS BIAS AND DISCRIMINATION PRETTY PRACTICE CHANGES. WE'VE ALSO BEEN WORKING TO IMPROVE THE CALIPHATE CHILD WELFARE COURT PRACTICE MODEL AND THE INTEGRATED CORE PRACTICE MODEL IN COLLABORATION WITH COUNTIES AND OUR SYSTEM OF CARE PARTNER. THE CALIFORNIA COURT PRACTICE MODEL AN INTEGRATED CORE PRACTICE MODEL ESTABLISHED COMMON BEHAVIORAL EXPECTATIONS. AIRLINE STAFF AND LEADERSHIP INCLUDING RACIAL EQUITY AND INCLUSION PRINCIPLE AND PRACTICE AS- I'M MORE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING OUR DATA SYSTEMS AS WELL FOR EXAMPLE RCW STMS THE SPAM HAS BEEN UPDATED TO TRACK SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER IDENTITY AND EXPRESSION BEIJING INFORMATION. MANAGEMENT DEVELOPING NEW CARE SYSTEM WORK FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT THERE IS NEW DATA ELEMENTS ALLOW US TO BETTER TRACK DISPARITIES AND DISPROPORTIONATELY. WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. IMPORTANTLY EVERY LAST THAT YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN CRITICAL REFORMS AIMED AT IMPROVING INSURING THAT CHILDREN WHO ARE REMOVED FROM A PARENT. CAN REMAIN CONNECTED TO THEIR OWN RELATIVES IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES THESE EFFORTS HAVE INCLUDED EQUAL FUNDING FOR RELATIVES THROUGH THE CREATION AND EXPANSION. OF THE APPROVED RELATIVE CAREGIVER PROGRAM CREATION OF THE EMERGENCY CARE GIVER PROGRAMS SO THAT CHILDREN CAN BE IMMEDIATELY CONNECTED WITH A FAMILY MEMBER AND SUPPORTED IN THAT HOME. AND EXPANSION OF THE INFANT SUPPLEMENTS ALONGSIDE WORK TO CHANGE POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT IMPACT OUR PARENTING DEPENDENT AND NON MINOR DEPENDENT TO SUPPORT THESE YOUNG PARENTS AND AVOID REMOVAL OF THEIR CHILDREN EMPLACEMENT IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. AND WE HAVE FAR. ON DEVELOPING A MORE ROBUST AND COMPREHENSIVE CONTINUUM OF PREVENTION SERVICE SAYS. IN AN EFFORT TO PREVENT CHILDREN FROM COMING INTO FOSTER CARE IN THE FIRST AND THEN AND THIS WORK IS BEING DONE VERY EXPLICITLY FOR RACIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY LINES. THE DATA HIGHLIGHTED TODAY REMINDS US THAT THERE'S MUCH MORE TO BE DONE AND WE APPRECIATE. THE RECOMMENDATION SHARED BY THE FORTE AND THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS I ESPECIALLY APPRECIATE THE BREAKDOWN OF THE RECOMMENDATION TO ADDRESS THE THIRTY AT EVERY STAGE OF OUR TOP WELFARE BUT SAM. AND I'M LOOKING AT THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE CAN SEE THAT THERE'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT WORK DONE IN JUST THE LAST YEAR TO ADVANCE SOME OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT. I THINK THE NEXT ACTION OF PREVENTION FUNDING FOR THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET OF TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO POINT FOUR MILLION GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT COUNTY EFFORT IN DEVELOPING THAT COMPREHENSIVE ARRAY OF PREVENTION SERVICES. AND ENSURE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT CULTURALLY RELEVANT AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES BUT. THEN OUR PREVENTION CONTINUE ON. WE'RE ALSO CREATING A CAN. PASS WE ARE ABLE. OF THE FAMILY PREVENTION BUT THE BACK TO ENSURE THAT TRUSTED COMMUNITY PARTNERS. CAN DELIVER PREVENTION SERVICES TO SUPPORT FAMILIES WITHOUT REQUIRING THEM TO DIRECTLY ENGAGE WITH CHILD WELFARE AGENCY IT. OUR PREVENTION PLAN ALSO ENSURES THAT ARE EXPECTED IN PARENTING YOUNG PEOPLE WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE FULL ARRAY OF PREVENTION SERVICES THE PREPAID THE PLAN. IMAGE FOURTEEN MENTION AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM WHICH CONTINUES TO SHOW TREMENDOUS PROMISE. WE'RE INTERESTED IN EXPLORING HOW TO EXPAND THAT MODEL TO SUPPORT A GREATER NUMBER OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. IN ADDITION THE CALIFORNIA PARENTS NEED HELP LINE THAT WE PROPOSE CONTINUING AND- THIS YEAR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN A GREAT SUPPORT IN PREVENTION STRATEGY OUR FAMILY. WE BELIEVE THE START OF LINES. GROUPS AND MOBILE RIFAI TEAMS THAT. IMPORTANT TO PREVENT INJURIES IN THE FOSTER CARE AND TO ENSURE PLACEMENT STABILITY AND FIX THAT. THE RECOMMENDATION THAT THE TIME KEEPING THE CHILDREN HARLEM FROM. CONNECTED TO THEIR- OWN FAMILIES AND COMMUNITY. WE AGREED THE CHILD OKAY TEAM NEED TO BE CENTERED IN CULTURAL COMPLEX. AND CONTINUED DEVELOP CONTINUE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. PETER DELIVERING ON THOSE GOALS. WE'VE SEEN GREAT SUCCESS OF THE SCREENING APPROACH WENT WELL AND WE'RE WORKING TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE. THAT AT THE TEAMING UP TO INTEGRATE ALL THE ASPECTS OF OUR INTEGRATED CORE PRACTICE OF. FILING THE PARKING MENTION THE PASSAGE OF SB THREE FIFTY FOUR LAST YEAR MORE WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS NOW TO FINALIZE THE GUIDANCE THE PERFORMANCE WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL FURTHER THE EFFORTS TO KEEP CHILDREN. CONNECTED WITH THEIR OWN FAMILIES AND THEIR OWN COMMUNITY WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. UNLESS FORTY. ENGAGEMENT AND WORKING TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THE DISPARITIES AND ENSURE EQUITY PRODUCT THAT'S THEM. THANK YOU.

THE FIRST QUESTION IN YOUR AGENDA WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO ADDRESS IS ONE OF OUT OF OBSERVATIONS AND POINTS OF INTEREST IN THIS CONVERSATION. CURRENTLY IS IN THE MIDST OF ANALYSIS AIMING TO HELP THE LEGISLATURE UNDERSTAND RACIAL DISPROPORTIONATELY IS AND DISPARITIES IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. AND TO IDENTIFY POLICY LEVERS THAT COULD HELP ADDRESS THOSE INEQUITIES. WORKING ON THE ANALYSIS BECAUSE AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY TALK WELFARE IS AN AREA WHERE THERE ARE VERY CLEAR AND PERVASIVE INEQUITIES THAT HAVE PERSISTED OVER TIME. ARE ALSO RESPONDING TO THE LEGISLATURE INTEREST AS DISCUSSED BY THE SUBCOMMITTEE LAST SPRING IN IDENTIFYING STATE PROGRAMS THAT ARE NATURAL CANDIDATES FOR FOCUS AND WORK TOWARD ADDRESSING RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN THE HUMAN SERVICES AREA. BUT THAT TWENTY TWO PAGES ONE AND TWO OF THE HANDOUT I'LL BRIEFLY DISCUSS SOME KEY DATA ILLUSTRATING CURRENT DISPARITIES WHICH HAVE HELPED TO- PROMPTS AND REALLY INFORM OUR ONGOING RESEARCH. I THINK HER TODAY HELLO IN CALIFORNIA BLACK AND NATIVE AMERICAN YOUTH IN PARTICULAR ARE OVER REPRESENTED IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM RELATIVE TO THEIR RESPECTIVE SHARES OF THE POPULATION AS ILLUSTRATED BY THE FIGURE. IN ADDITION RESEARCH AUTHORED BY DOCTORS AND WE PUT IMPORTANT QUARANTINE DANIEL WEBSTER YOU HEARD FROM EARLIER ON THE PANEL. AND OTHERS ON CUMULATIVE CHILD WELFARE INVOLVEMENT OF A CALIFORNIA BIRTH COHORT. FOUND NEARLY 50% OF BLACK AND NATIVE AMERICAN CHILDREN EXPERIENCED SOME LEVEL OF CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT BY THE TIME THEY TURNED EIGHTEEN. AND THIS IS COMPARED TO LOWER ALTHOUGH STILL SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGES OF CHILDREN OF OTHER RACES. THE SAME RESEARCH ALSO FOUND THAT LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA CHILDREN BOTH WITH PUBLIC HEALTH INSURANCE EXPERIENCED CHILD WELFARE INVOLVEMENT AT MORE THAN TWICE THE RATE OF THOSE WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE. BUT I NEED TO PAGE THREE OF THE HAND OUT. RACIAL DISPARITIES ARE PRESENT WITHIN INITIAL ALLEGATIONS AND PERSIST AT ALL LEVELS OF THE SYSTEM BECOMING THE MOST PRONOUNCED FOR YOUTH AND KERR- AND AGAIN THIS WAS ALSO DESCRIBED EARLIER BY DR DANIEL WEBSTER AND IS SHOWN IN THE FIGURE. THE PAGE FOR THE HANDS UP HANDS OUT- NOW ADDRESS THE SECOND QUESTION IN YOUR AGENDA. WHAT ARE THE KEY AREAS OF POLICY THAT THE STATE CAN FOCUS ON TO POTENTIALLY MAKE AN IMPACT TO REDUCE AND ELIMINATE DISPARITIES IN CHILD WELFARE. THERE ARE FOUR MAIN POLICY AREAS WE PLAN TO EXPLORE ON GOING RESEARCH AND HEALTH. WE AT WE PLAN TO IDENTIFY MORE SPECIFIC POLICY OPTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER AS WELL AS TO- WAIT WAIT IS THE TRADE OFF AND POTENTIAL BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS OF THE OPTION. THE DAY- I'LL START BY SHARING SOME INITIAL KEY QUESTIONS GUIDING THE FIRST PHASE ABOUT RESEARCH. FOR ALL THE AREA THAT WE'RE RESEARCHING IS MANDATED REPORTING. THE VAST MAJORITY OF MALTREATMENT ALLEGATIONS COME FROM MANDATED REPORTERS TO INCLUDE THE TEACHERS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WARM. THANK YOU QUESTION FOR EXPLORING AROUND THE POLICY AREA INCLUDE DEMANDED DO MANDATED REPORTERS RECEIVE SUFFICIENT TRAINING IN PARTICULAR IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING. SHOULD ALL MANDATED REPORTERS GO DIRECTLY TO THE CHILD WELFARE AGENCY OR COULD SOME REPORTS INSTEAD BE REFERRED FOR SERVICES OR SOME OTHER TYPE OF INTERVENTION. AND HOW CAN THE STATE IN SHORTSTOP WHAT CHILD SAFETY IS PRIORITISED WATER FORMING MANDATED REPORTING RESEARCH IS REMOVAL DUE TO NEGLECT. AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE FIGURE ON PAGE FIVE OF THE HANDOUT THE REASON CITED FOR MOST REMOVALS IT'S NEGLECT RATHER THAN ABUSE. HOWEVER WE DON'T HAVE EASILY QUANTIFIABLE DATA ABOUT THE SPECIFIC HARM OR RISK TO THE CHILD THAT UNDERLIES NEGLECT ALLEGATIONS. IN OTHER WORDS WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH AT AN AGGREGATED STATE LEVEL ABOUT THE SPECIFIC SITUATIONS CAUSING CHILDREN TO BE REMOVED DUE TO NEGLECT. I PLEDGE FROM SHE QUESTIONS WERE EXPLORING FOR THE OF THE AREA INCLUDE OTHER STATUTORY CHANGES OR CLARIFICATIONS THAT SHOULD BE MADE TO THE DEFINITION OF NEGLECT. AND WHAT DATA SHOULD THE STATE COLLECTED TO DATE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CAUSES OF NEGLECT FOR EXAMPLE TO WHAT EXTENT IS NEGLECT PRIMARILY DUE TO PARENTAL SUBSTANCE ABUSE MENTAL HEALTH PRINT FRONTAL ABSENT. AND HOW COULD KNOWING THIS HELP INFORM POLICY CHANGES TO PREVENT AND REMEDY NEGLECT MOVING FORWARD. TURNING TO PAGE SIX THE THIRD POLICY AREA WHERE RE RESEARCHING IS PREVENTION. ARE CURRENTLY AT STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING FOR CHILD WELFARE SERVICES GENERALLY IS AVAILABLE TO FAMILIES ONLY AFTER THERE'S BEEN AN ALLEGATION AND A FAMILY COMES TO THE ATTENTION OF THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. THE KEY QUESTIONS WERE RESEARCHING IN THIS AREA ARE WHAT SUPPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER TO TARGET DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES PRIOR TO TRAVEL OUR SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT. AND FINALLY THE FOURTH RESEARCH FOCUS AREA- FOR OUR ONGOING WORK IS LINKING VULNERABLE FAMILIES TO ECONOMIC SUPPORT. RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT POVERTY AND ECONOMIC STRESSORS MAY CREATE CONDITIONS IN WHICH CHILD MALTREATMENT IS MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR- IN ADDITION RESEARCH HAS FOUND A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INCREASED STATE SPENDING ON PUBLIC BENEFIT PROGRAMS. SUCH AS CASH IN KIND ASSISTANCE AND HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND DECREASED CHILD MALTREATMENT. AS SUCH THE KEY QUESTIONS WERE BORING FOR THE POLICY AREA INCLUDE HOW CAN THE LEGISLATURE HELP ENSURE POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROGRAMS AND CHILD WELFARE SUPPORT ARE COMPLEMENTARY. AND WHICH PROGRAMS ARE MOST LIKELY TO CONTRIBUTE TO IT TO A REDUCTION IN CHILD MALTREATMENT. STOP THERE AND HAPPY TO HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH THAT I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DÍAS TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS. WILL BEGIN WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROSS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. ON THOSE QUESTIONS AND REALLY LOOKING AT- SOME OF THE PRESENTATION PARTICULARLY INTO THE NATIVE AMERICAN. COMPONENT OF IT- THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL. SERVICES HAS BEEN WORKING TO IMPROVE CHILD. WELFARE OUTCOMES FOR SEVERAL YEARS BUT- WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE STILL ACCORDING TO THE GRASS OR STILL IS A LOT OF WORK THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE. SO WHAT ONE OF MY FIRST QUESTIONS IS WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST BARRIERS THAT YOU'RE SEEN- ON WHY WE'RE STILL SEEING SUCH A HIGH RATE- WITHIN THE NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER KEN JOHNSON DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AB. RESTATE THE QUESTION AND I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY- THAT PART OF THIS WORK THAT WE'RE DOING RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INDIAN CHILD WELFARE ACT PLAN REALLY ENSURING THAT- WE ARE VERY STRATEGIC IN PRIORITIZING THE RIGHT COMPONENTS AS WE'RE GOING FORWARD ON THE LAND IS KEY. AT TO MAKE STRIDES AND WE ARE UNDER THAT'S UNDER DEVELOPMENT NOW I WOULDN'T IT FEW DIFFERENT THINGS IN TERMS OF OUR RELATIONSHIP OF IMPLEMENTING IT QUICKLY BEING DEVELOPING NEW POSITIONS FOR IT WITH FIELD SPECIALISTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO HELP. OUR BE A BRIDGE BETWEEN IN A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDER BETWEEN TRIBES AND COUNTIES AS WE'RE GOING OUT. ON AS WELL BUT I THINK ULTIMATELY AT MANY OF THE ITEMS THAT I COVERED IN TERMS OF HOW YOU'RE MORE APT PROBABLY LOOKING TO BE INVESTING IN PREVENTION AND DESTRUCTING PROPERTY ARE WAYS IN WHICH WE ARE SPECIFICALLY AT ADDRESSING THAT THE INTRICATE INTRODUCTION OF- NATIVE CHILDREN INTO THE SYSTEM AS WELL. AS DEPUTY DIRECTOR. SHORTS ANYTHING YOU'D ACT THERE. NO I AGREED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE EQUITY PLAN WILL HELP US CREATE THOSE PRIORITIES THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY- WHAT THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL ARE OFFICE OF TRIBAL AFFAIRS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE WORK CONNECTING ON THE ISSUES. WHERE WE KNOW THERE NEEDS TO BE GREATER ENGAGEMENT SUPPORT INCLUDING TRYING TO REALLY SUPPORT TRIED AND DEVELOPING THEIR OWN FOUR YEAR AGREEMENT- WITH THE STATE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO. I'M REALLY SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN- THAT WORK BETTER WITHIN THEIR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES- THE EFFORT TO DATE AND THAT LET'S CULTURALLY RELEVANT WAYS THEY KNOW THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR CHILDREN IN THEIR COMMUNITY. IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU SIMPLY MEMBER I'D LIKE TO BRING IN SUPREME FOR AS WELL AS- LEAD TO PROVIDE COMMENTS TO YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU MISTER. AT THE SABRINA FORTY FROM THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS. WELCOME THE INVITATION TO COMMENT ON THIS. CRITICAL QUESTION- AND VERY GRATEFUL TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES FOR THE EFFORTS TAKEN THAT'S FAR ECWA IS SEEN AS- A GOLD STANDARD IN THE WAY- THAT COMMUNITIES- SHOULD. SHOULD BE APPROACHING REMOVALS- FROM THE HOME AND CHILD WELFARE INTERVENTIONS AND EXPLORING OUR- RECOMMENDATIONS IN OUR REPORT WE ACTUALLY LOOK TO- WHAT IT IMPLEMENTATION OF A QUOTE WITH FIDELITY WOULD LOOK LIKE AND WHAT TAKE AWAY IT'S- TIME COULD BE INCORPORATED INTO- OUR STATE AND COUNTY LEVEL CHILD WELFARE SYSTEMS INCLUDING THINGS LIKE TROUT TRIBAL CUSTOMARY ADOPTION SO. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT WE ARE EXPLORING AS WELL AND VERY SUPPORTIVE OF. I'M THANK YOU CHAIR I WOULD JUST ADD THAT IN FROM THE PREVENTION PERSPECTIVE THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE DATA ABOUT HOW- FAMILIES IN NATIVE COMMUNITIES WHETHER THEY'RE- WITHIN YOUR THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY OR IN. INDIA'S TOGETHER ARE HAVING ACCESS TO THE SERVICES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT AND ARE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SUPPORT THAT'S AVAILABLE AND WE ALSO NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE STAFF WERE WORKING ON THESE PROGRAMS ARE. TRAINED AND UNDERSTAND THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND OR DIFFERENCES OR I'M COMMUNITIES AND FROM THE NATIVE. COMMUNITY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER FOLKS. ARE REACHING OUT TO YOU SO I THINK THAT IT'S ABOUT EDUCATION I THINK IT'S ABOUT A MONITORING AND MAKING SURE WE HAVE THE FABRICATED DATA TO ENSURE THAT OUR FOLKS ARE UTILIZING THAT REPRESENTS THE PART THAT ARE AVAILABLE- UNDER ALSO- FEDERAL STRENGTH THE FUNDING PARTICULARLY DIRECTED FOR OUR NATIVE COMMUNITIES INCLUDING FOR HOME VISITING. THEIR OTHER I'M SOURCES THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE EVERYTHING. TO THE MAX. DEGREE THANK YOU FOR THAT AND SOME HEARTENING KNOW THAT YOU REACHING TO THE TRI COME. TO LEARN FIRST HAND OF. WHAT ISSUE STILL- COULD BE CONSIDERED- BARRIERS- TO ENSURE THAT- NATIVE AMERICAN FOSTER CARE KIDS- ARE. ALSO KEPT WITHIN THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY- CERTAINLY IT WAS CREATED TO CREATE THE CULTURE- THE HERITAGE VERY MUCH ALIVE EVEN THOUGH. THE GOVERNMENT AT TIMES AND YOU COULD SEE IT RESEARCH IT- STRIPPED NATIVE AMERICANS OF THAT CULTURE ITSELF. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME AND FOR OTHERS- THAT ARE ENGAGED IN THIS TYPE OF DISCUSSION ESPECIALLY WITH IT QUOTE AND WHAT'S GOING AROUND ON AROUND A QUOTE CURRENTLY WITH THE SUPREME COURT IN SOME OF THE DIFFERENT DECISIONS. SO I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. THAT AT LEAST WERE CHIMING IN AND WE'RE WE'RE- HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE IN THE AREAS TO ENSURE THAT THE NUMBER ONE REASON NICHOLAS CREATE IT WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT CULTURE. REMAINS STRONG AND THOSE THAT- THROUGH A GOVERNMENTAL SYSTEM THE TRIED TO SIMULATE- AND TAKE AWAY THAT CULTURE THAT NOW. WHEN IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM THAT THEY'RE NOW BEING LOOKED TO BE ENGAGE WITH A NATIVE AMERICAN FAMILY. AND WITHOUT- MOVING FORWARD ON THOSE THOSE ISSUES AND- IN THOSE TOPICS AND WE KNOW THAT IT QUA AND CAL EQUIPMENT AND SOMETIMES COUNTIES- HAVE TO BE. REMINDED TO BE ENGAGED IN THAT PROCESS OF. HAVING NATIVE AMERICAN CHILDREN TO NATIVE AMERICAN FAMILIES- IN IN THE IT CHRYSOSTOM BUT- HOW DO YOU SEE- AND THIS IS A QUESTION WE'RE POSING MISTER. CHAIRMAN YOU COULD FIGURE OUT- AND IMPOSE THE QUESTIONS OF THOSE THAT COULD BEST ANSWER. AND IT'S A GENERAL QUESTION IS IN CALIFORNIA. AND HOW ARE WE BEST TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. AND THAT IT IS GOING TOWARDS THE NATIVE AMERICAN- CHILDREN HERE IN THE STATE. ON AT ALL DIFFERENT THAT CAN CERTAIN TALK ABOUT THE STATE BUT HOW DO WE ENCOURAGE THE COUNTY TO THE ENGAGE WITH THAT ESPECIALLY. AS WE SEE WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND THE TOPIC OF ECWA NOW. LET'S BEGIN WITH THE DIRECTOR AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF POSSIBLE. SURE I WOULD SAY I THINK YOU SOMEWHERE I THINK THAT AT THE FIELD SPECIALISTS AT POSITION THAT I REFERENCE IS ONE OF THOSE WAYS WHERE WE ARE IT'S THE IT'S THE CONNECTOR THE BRIDGE BETWEEN THE COUNTY AND THE TRIBES AS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO EQUIP LIMITATION. AT THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO- BOTH HOLD TRAVEL ADVISORY AT COMMITTEE MEETINGS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS WITH TRIBES OF WHICH THIS IS ONE OF THAT PRIMARY TOPICS OF THE STANDING AGENDA ITEM THAT WE DISCUSSED BUT WE ALSO. ARE CONSIDERING FORMAL CONSULTATION WITH TRIBES ARE RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EQUUS- BUT THERE'S CERTAINLY A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT WE ARE OBTAINING THROUGH THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND IN BETWEEN THOSE AT MEETINGS AND CONVERSATIONS AROUND ANY CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS ARE BEING EXPERIENCED IN RELATIONSHIP TO IMPLEMENTATION SO. THAT WE HAVE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION I PARTICIPATE ON THE TRAVEL ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND CONTINUE TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH COUNTIES I IN THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CAPACITY. TO ENSURE IMPLEMENTATION IS OCCURRING. MISTER CHAIR A IN THROUGH THE CHAIR OF ITS A- WE COULD SEE SOME TYPE COMPARING DATA- MAYBE THREE YEARS FIVE YEARS PRIOR. TO WHERE WE'RE AT NOW TO SEE IF SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS IN THE WAY THE APPROACH THAT'S TAKING PLACE IS A TRULY HAVING. AN IMPACT- WITHIN THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND IF SO GREAT WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IF NOT THEN MAYBE THAT'S WHEN WE NEED TO- COME BACK TOGETHER AND HAVE SOME MORE DISCUSSIONS AND I BELIEVE IN COLLUDING. AGAIN THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY INTO SOME OF THESE AREAS- WOULD BE BENEFICIAL WE SEE THE NUMBERS THAT ARE HERE WE SEE THEIR HIGH WE SEE THEIR ALARMING. BUT THROUGH THE CHAIR THE NUMBERS THREE YEARS AGO FIVE YEARS AGO WITH A SIMILAR ARE TO HAVE WE MADE AN IMPACT. I MISS YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN I CAN SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- BECAUSE OF THE POINT IT'S A IT'S A VERY GOOD POINT BECAUSE SPECTACULAR PLACE UP BUT HOW WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THESE DISPARITY INDUSTRIES THAT MAKE THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN THESE GROUPS AND THEY- IN SOME CASES SIMPLIFY SOME OF THE UNDERLYING. TRENDS THAT ARE GOING ON SO WITHOUT TAKING ANY FOCUS AWAY FROM THE NEED TO FOCUS ON THIS AREA ABSOLUTELY WE NEED TO I WILL SAY THAT THAT THE DRAPES IF WE IF YOU LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING RATES OF ENTRIES FOR EXAMPLE THEY HAVE BEEN DECLINING IN OUR STATE. FOR AMERICAN INDIAN CHILDREN AS WELL AS FOR ALL THE CHILDREN AND SO THE DECLINE OVER THAT TIME IS GOING DOWN FOR ALL OF OUR ALL OF THE DIFFERENT GROUPS SO THAT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM- ARE START WORK WILL RETAIN THEM EVEN THOUGH WE MAY WE ARE MAKING SOME PROGRESS IN TERMS OF OUR INTEREST. RATES FOR THAT PARTICULAR GROUP SO I COULD SAY PARK- FIVE YEARS AGO THE RATE OF REMOVAL OR AMERICAN INDIAN CHILDREN WAS- ABOUT- ELEVEN PER THOUSAND SENATE AND THEN NOW IT STATES THAT EIGHT POINT SO I THINK IT'S OVER EIGHT SO IT'S STILL. VERY HIGH COMPARED TO THE OVERALL RATE FOR OUR STATE BUT IT HAS BEEN BEEN COMING DOWN SO AND WHEN YOU COMPARE THE AMERICAN INDIAN RIGHT. TO THE TOP FLIGHT- INTEREST ENTRY RIGHT NOW THEY'RE STILL THAT THAT DISPARITY STILL THIS PERCEPTION WE DEFINITELY NEED TO WORK ON IT BUT I BUT SPEECH YOUR POINT ABOUT ARE WE MAKING PROGRESS IT DOES APPEAR FROM THE DATA. IS THAT WE ARE MOVING IN A GOOD DIRECTION I WILL SAY TO ECHO SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES POINTS WE NEED BETTER DATA TO EXAMINE THOSE AREAS THOSE INTERVENTIONS THE MORE GRANULAR LEVEL TO SEE WHERE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THE BARRIERS ARE THAT WE CAN OVERCOME AND FIND OUT WHICH PROGRAMS MAY BE HAVING. A BETTER A FACT THAT WE CAN ONLY DO THAT BY FOCUSING IN ON SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS AND SPECIFIC TARGET POPULATIONS TO HELP EVALUATE THE SUCCESS. OF THOSE TO DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. THANK THANK YOU MISS CHAIRMAN YOU. VERY EXPLAINED IT AND- LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE DATA SO WE COULD I'M TYING WAS ANOTHER SPEAKER. I WANTED TO KNOW ONE OTHER THING THAT WAS INCLUDED. IN OUR- IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL THIS YEAR WHICH WAS FUNDING TO SUPPORT OUR FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES- IN PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COUNTY USE THAT DEVELOPMENT AT TRIBAL CONSULTATION POLICIES WHAT THEY COUNTIES- ARE COUNTY CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES AND PROBATION DEPARTMENTS. DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE THE TRIBAL CONSULTATION POLICIES IN PLACE AND WE HAVE THEM AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT TO YOUR POINT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE THOSE CONSULTATION POLICIES. IN PLACE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THAT'LL WE HAVE THE INTERAGENCY- COMMITTEE IS SET AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT ARE WORKING TO DEVELOP THE PROTOCOLS TO ADDRESS THE BARRIERS- ACROSS THE ENTIRE SYSTEM OF CARE THAT THAT'S INCLUSIVE OF TRIBAL CONSULTATION. ON A SOUTHERN SPENDING- PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR TO ALLOW TRIED. TO FUND THE TRIED TO PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT TO COUNTY. DEVELOPING THEIR POLICY. THANK YOU FOR FROM UP THE IN. TOPIC WE'RE TO AT THIS LEVEL BUT IT'S AT THE COUNTY LEVELS ALSO WE HAVE TO ENCOURAGE- COMPLIANCE AND RELATIONSHIP BUILDING- WITH THE LOCAL TRIBES SO THAT WE CAN. START TO HAVE AN IMPACT CHIU IMPACT ON ON- THE NATIVE AMERICAN- CHILDREN IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND ALCOA INDIAN- CHILD WELFARE ACT AND CAL ITS WORK HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WE'RE WATCHING THAT MONITORING IT AND I THINK NOW MORE THAN EVER. WE NEED TO BE MORE- AWARE OF IT BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT COURT- CASES THAT ARE GOING ON WITH IT. I THANK YOU FOR THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO LISTEN TO LEARN TO HEAR FROM HISTORY AND TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS GOING FORWARD. APPRECIATE YOUR INPUTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND BELIEVE THAT. IT WILL ALLOW OUR STATE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ADDRESSING THIS DISPARITY HEAD ON AS WELL. WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. WANT TO SEE IF ANY OTHER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS. SEE NON- BRING IT TO THE CHAIR I FIRST WANTED TO START WITH- DIRECTOR JOHNSON AND MISS SHORTS IF I COULD I REALLY WANNA APPRECIATE THE OFFICE OF EQUITY. AND I'M ALWAYS REMINDED THAT EQUITY IS BUILT INTO THE LAST MILE OF IMPLEMENTATION. BUT I WANTED TO HEAR A LITTLE MORE ABOUT YOUR CORE PRACTICE MODEL. CAN YOU HELP TO SHARE SOME OF THE EFFORTS. THAT HAVE BEEN FOSTERED BY THE STATE'S TO CONFRONT AND REDUCE IMPLICIT BIAS. THAT WE HAVE WITHIN CHILD WELFARE AND HOW CAN WE AS A STATE HAVE LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA. VERY MUCH CHAIR FOR THE QUESTION NOT ALL TURNED OVER TO DEPUTY DIRECTOR SPORTS IN JUST A MOMENT I WILL JUST TELL YOU THAT- OFFICE OF EQUITY PART OF THAT CREATION OF THAT WAS BORN OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT'S PARTICIPATION IN THE GOVERNMENT ALLIANCE FOR RACIAL EQUITY INITIATIVE OUR GEAR. I WHICH WE WERE ONE OF TWELVE OTHER STATE DEPARTMENTS AS PART OF A COHORT GOING THROUGH SOME EXACTLY THOSE AT HISTORICAL. AT COMPONENTS OF OUR SYSTEMS AND HOW THEY CAME TO BE AGAIN ONE OF KNOWLEDGE TO WORK- AT THE ALLIANCE HAS DONE I THE REPORT THAT SPEAKS TO FROM ABOUT HISTORY HERE AS IT RELATES TO CHILD WELFARE- IT REALLY THAT WORKS TO CREATE- IF YOU WILL THE TRAINING OF TRAINER MODEL AMBASSADORS AT THAT CAN COME BACK. AND HAVE COME BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT TO BUILD AGAIN OUR COMPETENCY ON WHAT IT MEANS TO LEAD WITH RACE EQUITY WHAT IT MEANS TO LOOK AT OUR- POLICIES THROUGH A LENS WITH ALL KINDS OF TOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN DENTAL DEVELOPED IN THAT SPACE. BUT I WILL SAY AS IT RELATES TO YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION IN CHILD WELFARE AND AGAIN THAT THE STAFF. THAT WE ARE ONE AND I WAS GONNA OF BODY OF WORK IN IN A LOT OF WORK THAT HAVE POTENTIALLY. AT ABSOLUTELY MIGHT ALSO SPEAK TO THAT FROM THE COUNTY'S PERSPECTIVE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT PROVIDING THAT KIND OF TRAINING AND SUPPORT WITHIN. OUT STATE CHILD WELFARE WORK FORCE AFTER SOMETIME NOW I PUT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND AGAIN AT THE STATE LEVEL. ENSURING THAT OUT THERE PROCESS SEES AND THEIR- STAFF UNDERSTAND HOW BIAS IMPACTS THE DECISIONS IN CRITICAL LIFE CHANGING DECISIONS THEY'RE MAKING EACH AND EVERY DAY. AND SO THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER AS- TRAINING COMPONENTS OF THE GOOD PART AS- THAT WORK THAT CONTINUE ON- BUT I THINK AGAIN A LOT OF THE LATEST CONVERSATION OF LITERATURE ABOUT AND HOW WE ARE THINKING. ABOUT A POLICY THROUGH THIS LENS IS REALLY WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON AND AGAIN A LOT OF THE EFFORTS INITIATIVES THAT I MENTIONED IN THAT. BUT SHORTS MENTIONED ARE IN RELATIONSHIP AND ACTUALLY DIRECT RESULTS. ESTIMATE BACK AT TRAINING IN DIALOGUE BUT- ACTIVITIES RECORDS WHAT'S MAKING US SHE. ADDED RELATED TO THE QUESTION. WHAT YOU'RE- JOHN SAID BEING. CORE COULD MODEL IS KEY AND WE ARE IN A- IT. CORRAL OUR WORK IN TURN THAT HOW WE CAN YOU TELL THEM FAMILY TEAM. IN ENGAGEMENT OF CARE PARTNER NETWORKS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE REGULAR AND ON GOING. ENGAGEMENT WHETHER YOUR PARTNER WE DEVELOP EXPENSIVE TOOLS AND RESOURCES THAT WE CAN POINT YOU TO JAIL. ON THE INTEGRATED CORE PRACTICE MODEL REPORT PAGE WE HAVE A TRAINING GUIDE- IT AND ARE YOU THINK THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF OUR SERVICES. ARE REALLY DRIVEN REAL COLLABORATION- AND COORDINATION WITH THE ACTUAL CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES WHO ARE- THE RECIPIENTS OF THE- SERVICES AND THE COURTS TO MAKE SURE. THAT THEY ARE EFFECTIVE. AS POSSIBLE. I'M GONNA NOW TO THE OF THIRTY WITH THE- WHERE- SOME PRACTITIONERS AND ADVOCATES HAVE EMBRACED KINSHIP CARE. FOR US AS A WAY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE RACIAL DISPROPORTION HOURLY THAT WE SEE WITHIN THE SYSTEM. AND YET THE AGENDA STATES THAT THIS RESULTS IN A PHENOMENAL PHENOMENON KNOWN AS HIDDEN FOSTER CARE. THAT I'D LIKE TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW COMMON. THIS IS HAPPENING AS I BELIEVE IT DEPRIVES US OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THE OTHER RESOURCES AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES THAT ARE SO PIVOTAL. OF A TOLL AS WE HEARD POVERTY IS A CRITICAL FACTOR IN THIS AREA AND FOR ABLE TO INCREASE RESOURCES WERE BETTER ABLE TO SUPPORT THOSE YOUNG FAMILIES I'D LIKE TO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW COMMON OF A PRACTICE THIS IS. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE DATA TO ACTUALLY INFORM HOW COMMON OF A PRACTICE IT IS I KNOW THERE WAS AN EXTENSIVE- REPORT DONE BY THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS BASED ON FOCUS GROUPS AND SURVEYS THAT AT LEAST GAINS THAT. THE MARKET ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE- PREVALENCE OF THE PRACTICE THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THERE WAS A BILL THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR AB TWO SIXTY- IN ORDER TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS. COORDINATION BETWEEN OUR PROBATE AND OUR DEPENDENCY COURT- AND WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF. GETTING THAT ALL CAN YOU LETTER RELATED TO THAT- YOU ARE OUT NOW SO THAT HOPEFULLY FAMILIES. ARE CONNECTED TO THE RIGHT THE SPENDING REPEAT THAT THE COURT PERFECT SENSE THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO. RE UNIFY IN ORDER TO AVOID ENTRY INTO FOSTER CARE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE HELLO WE ARE FOR TWENTY INTERESTED IN EXPLORING. THE TOPIC- IN GREATER DETAIL AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS THAT WE CAN GET AT THAT. I BOTH NUMBERS THAT YOU'RE SPEAKING BUT I BUT WE DON'T HAVE DATA THAT REALLY TRACKS THAT THE PROBLEMS THAT. THE PRACTICE- EARLIER WE HEARD WERE HAVING DECREASING NUMBERS WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN OUR CHILD WELFARE SERVICES SYSTEM AND- WONDER. HOW MANY OF THEM MAY BE SHOWING UP IN THIS HIDDEN FOSTER CARE THAT WE HAVE IN BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO- UNDERSTAND THAT SCOPE AND SO LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS. UP WANT TO FOLLOW UP NOW WITH DOCTOR WEBSTER AS WELL AS THE ADMINISTRATION TO UNDERSTAND THE EXPERIENCE OF ARE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION IN. THIS SYSTEM EXPLICITLY. AND HOW DISPARITIES LOOK FOR THIS POPULATION WITHIN CHILD WELFARE. SERVICES DO WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION- THIS IS DANIEL WEBSTER TO KNOWLEDGE WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD READ ON THAT- I DON'T KNOW THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT'S CAPTURED IN OUR DATA SYSTEM WITH ANY KIND OF. RELIABILITY AND IT CERTAINLY HASN'T BEEN SOMETHING THAT THAT MY TEAM HAS. LOOK AT SPECIFICALLY CELL WOULD HAVE TO YOU KNOW I TOOK TOOK TOOK CIRCLE BACK ON THAT ONE ACROSS MY COLLEAGUES. AT THE STATE AND WE HAVE DONE SOME PRELIMINARY LOOKS BUT FROM MY- UNDERSTANDING THE SYSTEM IT'S OUR- I DON'T KNOW HOW WELL WE'RE TRACKING AT THIS POINT. I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT IF THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBLE. I WOULD AGREE WITH MR WEBSTER I THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY WOULD YOU BE A SUBSET OF THE POPULATION TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IS WE DO- AT AT ANDERSTON AND ACCOMPANIED AND DOCUMENTED MINOR SPECIFICALLY AT THE SPECIFIC PROGRAM YOU YOU HAVE. A PROGRAM THAT WE TOGETHER WITH AT THE LEGISLATURE THE ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATURE UNVESTED LEGAL SERVICES AND- IN TERMS OF A PATHWAY- THE OTHER KIND OF WITH A PARITY PROGRAM BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY AND DOCUMENTS AND ACCOUNT IT'S EXCUSE ME IT'S THE- AT. REFUGEE MINORS PROGRAM AND ADULTS AGAIN ARE AT YOU THROUGH HAVE REFUGEE STATUS SO THEY WOULDN'T CUT KIND OF FOLLOW THEM I THINK THE BROADER QUESTION THAT YOU'RE ASKING- BUT AGAIN AT- GOOD GRIEF MISTER WEBSTER THAT IT'S A PLACE THAT WE WOULD NEED TO HAVE. MORE DATA TO BE MORE SPECIFIC TO YOUR TO YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION- I WILL THEN DRAWS- FOR MY NEXT QUESTION TO THE L. A. O.'S GRAPH ON THE BOTTOM OF PAGE FOURTEEN. WHICH IDENTIFIES THAT- OFTEN TO MANY OF OUR FOR. WHO AN X. FAMILY. ARE WITH DIMINISHED RESOURCES TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE- POVERTY CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE THAT I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND- THE NUMBER OF UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN WHO WE HAVE IN OUR SYSTEM TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR NOT IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR US TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS. TO CAL WORKS BASED ON THE GRAPH THAT WE HAVE FROM THE L. A. L. Y. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS FINANCE AND L. A- SOME OF THEIR THOUGHTS AND POTENTIAL COSTS THAT WOULD COME WITH US INCREASING GRANTS FOR FAMILIES WHO DO HAVE AN EXCLUDED FAMILY MEMBER. AND I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH MORE DETAILS BUT WANTED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN CAL WORKS AND THOSE WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED WITHIN OUR CHILD WELFARE SERVICES SYSTEM. HOPING TO GET UP. AT LEAST INITIAL THOUGHTS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON THIS. I'LL I'LL ED DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE AT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF HE WANTS TO ADD ANYTHING MORE SPECIFICALLY HERE BUT YES I THINK AGAIN WE HAVE A WITH YOU AND MAKE THE COMMITMENT TO RAISE THAT THE GRANT LEVELS OVER TIME AND NOTING THAT THERE I WE STILL HAVEN'T ACHIEVED AT SOME OF THE- THRESHOLD IN WHICH LEGISLATURES ASSET OUT FOR GOALS AND OBJECTIVES- SO I IN TERMS OF GETTING COST ESTIMATES THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. ADDED GLAD TO WORK WITH YOU TO FORGET MY COLLEAGUE AT THE PROPERTY FINANCE IF YOU. SEE JUSTIN. OF FINANCE THINK. I THINK SOME THAN EVER- AND- HAS BEEN PROVIDED FROM THE DEPARTMENT REGARDING THOSE GROUND LEVELS AND- JUST RECOMMEND IT'S I BELIEVE IT'S IN THE FOOTNOTES AS WELL ON NINE- CHART THAT. YEAH GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROJECT SEVEN POINT 1% GRANT INCREASE PER COW WORKS AND WE WILL BE RE- RE EVALUATING THAT AGAIN HERE THEY MAY REVISION PROCESS AS IT'S BASED OFF OF REVENUE PROJECTIONS FOR. THE CHILD POVERTY AND FAMILY SUB ACCOUNTS SO- IT'S- DIED THE GREAT INCREASE JUST NOTING FOR EVERYONE IS DEPENDENT UPON WHAT THE REVENUES ARE COMING IN AT AS WELL AS CASELOAD. ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE COW WORKS PROGRAM. I JUST FEEL OBLIGED TO REMIND US THAT- WE BASED THE AMOUNTS THAT WE GIVE BASED ON THE A. U. AND THE NUMBER OF FAMILY MEMBERS THEY HAPPENED WHEN WE DON'T COUNT CERTAIN FAMILY MEMBERS WHO STILL LIVE IN THE HOUSE SINCE THE ONLY DEFEAT. WE ARE DIMINISHING THE OVERALL RESOURCES THAT THE REST OF THE FAMILY IS ABLE TO. RECEIVE AND THUS ARE EXACERBATING MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY I'D LIKE TO NOW MOVE TO SABRINA FORTE IF I COULD- WITHIN THE- PATH TO RACIAL EQUITY REPORT I REALLY APPRECIATED THE QUICK SYNOPSIS THAT YOU GAVE FOR. PREVENTION EXPANDING- FIRST TALL KIDS THE LEGAL REP BEFORE- AS WELL AS BUILDING UP THE FAMILY NETWORK THAT I WANTED TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO STATE WHAT ARE SOME OF THOSE KEY PRIORITIES SPECIFICALLY. THAT THE STATE CAN DO IN THE NEAR TERM TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT MUCH OF WHAT YOU BROUGHT FROM YOUR REPORT. AS AS MUCH SHORTS INDICATED EARLIER THE STATE HAS ALREADY MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS OVER AND I'M JUST THE PAST YEAR AND- IMPLEMENTING IN S. B. ARE BEGINNING TO IMPLEMENT SB THREE FIFTY FOUR TO ADDRESS RELATIVES WITH CONVICTION HISTORIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED- I WANT TO BUILD ON THAT- PROGRESS AND SAY THAT ONE THING- ONE AREA FOR EARLY- AND- SHORT TERM ACTION IS REALLY THINKING ABOUT THE WAY. ON THAT ARE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR DEFINE- EMILY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR TRIBAL PARTNERS- FROM OUR PARTNERS AND IN THE BLACK AND LATINO X. COMMUNITY IS AND THINK ABOUT HOW TO SUPPORT THE FAMILY NETWORK REALLY BROADLY- NOT WITHSTANDING THE LONG STANDING IN. RULES AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO YOU KNOW THE CHILD AFFAIRS PERCEPTION OF WHAT AN APPROPRIATE HOME IS- SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO TO IMPLEMENTATION OF SB THREE FIFTY FOUR- REVIEW SB THREE FIFTY FOUR IMPLEMENTATION TAKE SOME DATA- PER PER THE LANGUAGE AT THE BELL- AND THEN. RETURN NEXT YEAR- BUT WITH SOME REFLECTIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO CLOSE GAPS- THERE ALSO CONTINUES TO BE IN A OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND EMERGENCY CHILD CARE BRIDGE PROGRAM- EXPAND THE ELIGIBILITY POPULATION OF THE FIRST PROGRAM. AS YOU NOTED- AND ALSO CONTINUE CLOSING THOSE GAPS WHERE RELATIVES ARE STILL NOT RECEIVING IN THE SAME FUNDING AND RESOURCES AS NON RELATIVES- THAT'S VERY EVIDENT FOR YOU KNOW RELATIVES AND HAD IMPOSTER CARE AND IMMEDIATE STEP THERE IS TO COLLECT AS MUCH DATA AS POSSIBLE TO FIGURE OUT. HOW MANY CHILDREN ARE LIVING AND THE IS- SETTINGS THAT THAT ARE NOT WITHIN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM AND DON'T HAVE- SUPPORT. AND SERVICES- AND SORRY THE LAST THING I'LL SAY AND IN TERMS OF RELATIVE PARITY IS MAKING SURE THAT THEY CAN GET PROGRAM ALSO COVERS ALL RELATIVE CARE GIVERS WHO EXITS A GUARDIANSHIP THROUGH THE JUVENILE COURT- IT'S ONE OF OUR ONLY REMAINING GAPS AFTER ABOUT A DECADE- OF EXCELLENT PROGRESS- AND WILL LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN I'M BEING PLACED IN KINSHIP CARE AND EXITING FOSTER CARE TO RELATIVE CARE AND HAVE BEEN THAT THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED- TO THRIVE AFTER THEY LEAVE THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM- FOR STACEY LEE I'M GOING TO ASK YOU THE% SAME QUESTION. WHAT IS A CONCRETE STEP THAT YOU CAN ADVISE THE STATE TO TAKE TO CONFRONT AND REDUCE RACIAL DISPARITIES WITHIN CHILD WELFARE AND I WILL- UP LIFT YOUR COMMENT ABOUT NOT INVESTING ENOUGH- INTO OUR HOME VISITING MODELS HAVING BEEN SOMEONE WHO FOUGHT SO HARD TO MAKE SURE WE WERE EXTENDING THAT SERVICE- BUT WOULD LIKE TO HEAR ANY OTHER CONCRETE STEPS THAT YOU HAVE. SURE ABSOLUTELY- AND AGAIN YET WE DEFINITELY RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP ROLE YOU PLAYED IN HELPING CALIFORNIA'S X. ART CREATE THE FIRST STATEWIDE INVESTMENT. IN HOME VISITING WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THAT- INITIATIVE AND I THINK THE DEPARTMENT HAS DONE A WONDERFUL JOB- INITIATING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT PROGRAM. WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES WITH EIGHT IN ADDITION TO MY COMMENTS ABOUT THE PANDEMIC SLOWING DOWN THE- EXPANSION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT EFFORT. IS THAT- HOME VISITING IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE REQUIRES THAT THOSE IN THE FIELD ARE CONNECTED TO ALL OF THE SERVICES AND SUPPORT AND I UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY CAN REFER FAMILIES CHOOSE THAT THEY NEED TO BE EMBEDDED IN WELL THAT WORKED. AND THERE HAS TO BE LOCAL THE STUDENTS FOR THOSE I'M HOPING THAT ARE HAVE% RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR COUNTY AGENCY PARTNERS WITH OTHER CEOS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS. SO WE'RE THINKING ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND LOCAL ON AN INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT THERE ARE ALREADY CONVERSATIONS THE EFFORTS HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE L.A. COUNTY HOUSE- A STELLAR MODEL IN TERMS OF THEIR HOME VISITING CONSORTIUM WERE ALL PROVIDERS. ARE CONNECTED- AND COLLABORATE ON REFERRALS- THEY- SUPPORT EACH OTHER IN TERMS OF IDENTIFYING RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE COUNTIES HOW. THOSE KINDS OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELATIONSHIPS EXPANDED- ACROSS THE STATE SO THEY CAN MAXIMIZE SMALL AMOUNT OF RESEARCH THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE FOR HOME VISITING AND OBVIOUSLY OF COURSE I THINK EXPANDING. OUR INVESTMENT IN HOME VISITING WOULD BE A GREAT. STAFF THAT ALSO REQUIRES THAT WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE NATIONAL MODEL PROGRAMS THAT THEY CAN. MEET US WHERE WE ARE BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA EXPANDS OUR INVESTMENT BY A FEW PERCENTAGE. IT KIND OF OVERTAKES THE COUNTRY BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE COMPARED TO OTHER PLACES SO IF WE NEED TO TRAIN A COUPLE HUNDRED OR THOUSAND. NEW HOME VISITORS. YOU KNOW THAT CAN- MAXIMIZE THEIR CREDIT TO PASS YOU WORKING WITH THEM ON HIS PLANS EXPANSION- AND THEN. COLLECTING THAT DATA ABOUT WHAT WORKING HOW CAN BE MORE. IN MAKING THAT WE- TRULY REACHING ALL OF THE CAN. WHO CHEN BE HAVE A ACCESS INVOLVING AND ARE SUPPORTED WELL BY THOSE PROGRAMS IN MAKING WE MAKE IT. AT THANK YOU FOR THAT. FINE QUESTION FOR DIRECTOR JOHN IS GOING TO BE ON. THE LINKAGES TO POINT- THAT YOU MENTIONED- YOU STATED THAT THERE'S A NEW EMPHASIS ON PREVENTION AND HOPING YOU COULD GO INTO A LITTLE MORE DETAIL. ON WHERE THIS WILL BE GOING. SURE GLAD TO CHAIR AT BEGIN THE PROGRAM IN PROJECT ORIGINALLY STARTED OUT OF THE IDEA THAT THERE WERE CONFLICTING. ASK FEDERAL POLICIES AT BETWEEN THE CHILD WELFARE AND ATTENDANCE SYSTEM ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND WAS REALLY WE WERE RECOGNIZING ON THE GROUND WITH THAT TRANSLATED TO WAS THAT WE COULD BE ASKING THE SAME FAMILY. AT TO COMPLY WITH ONE PROGRAM THAT MIGHT RESULT IN NON COMPLIANCE OF THE OTHER NOT SIMPLY I WASN'T ACCEPTABLE SO THEY REMEMBER AS AB POLICY COMPONENTS IN WAYS IN WHICH WE AT AT. IT YOU'RE A DRESS THOSE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED. AGAIN AS I MENTIONED OVER TIME THAT THE FUNDING FOR THIS PARTICULAR INITIATIVE HAS VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY AND SO WE HAD SOME COUNTIES OVER THE COURSE OF THE HISTORY OF THE PROJECT. CONTINUES TO WORK I'M LOOKING AT THOSE AT CONNECTIONS ACROSS- BUT BY AND LARGE AND WE HAVE KIND OF READ. IT WITH THIS AT THE LAUNCH AT THE SPRING THE-IDEA THAT WE REALLY LOOK AT THE PREVENTATIVE ASPECTS- I BOTH BOTH SIDES OF THE HOUSE IF YOU WILL TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO. AT TO BRING THEM TOGETHER THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE ALSO BEEN LOOKING AT. WHAT'S INTERNAL TO THE DEPARTMENT HOW ARE ALL OF THE- EFFORTS INTERVENTIONS AND- CONNECTIONS THAT WE ARE HAPPY THAT ARE HAPPENING- DIRECTOR SAFETY NET PROGRAMS AND ESPECIALLY AS THERE AS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED. AT TO ADDRESS ANY ANY PROPERTY EXPERT RECKONS ARE EXPERIENCING HOW IS THAT CONNECTING- VERY SPECIFICALLY INTUITIVE EXAMPLE THAT WAS GIVEN AROUND VOLUNTARY- STRAIGHT FACE SOME VISITING APPROACHES HOW ARE WE GETTING AHEAD OF THE FRONT SO. THE IDEA IS TO CREATE THE SPACE AND SET THE TABLE FOR THE. COUNTY IN THE STATE TO COME TO GET. SEE WHAT ELSE WE CAN BE JUNE. AS IT RELATES TO PRIMARY SECOND TERTIARY PREVENT- IN IN ADDITIONAL THAT WOULD OUT OF THAT OBVIOUSLY. AT AT DIRECTOR SPORTS MENTIONED AT COUNTIES ARE RIGHT NOW IN GAUGING IN THE FAMILY'S FIRST APPREHENSION.

FOLLOWED BY ANGIE SWARTS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CDSS. THEN WE WILL HAVE JUSTIN FRAYED US WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ANGELES SHORT WITH THE L. A. L. KATHY SANDERLING MCDONALD'S WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND CHRIS STONER MARKS WITH THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES. LET'S BEGIN WITH IT JENNIFER TROYER OF DSS WHEN YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU CHAIR ARAMBULA AND GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IT IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUES FACING OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. F. THE PANDEMIC IN AN INCREASE IN NATURAL DISASTERS HAS CHALLENGED OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN PARTICULAR. CDSS AND OUR PARTNERS HAVE BEEN TASKED WITH RESPONDING TO MANY URGENT NEEDS. WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING OUR ENERGY AND ATTENTION URGENTLY ON THOSE RESPONSES WHILE ALSO CONTINUING TO IMPLEMENT VERY CRITICAL CHANGES. UNDER THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM. AND AS WE'LL DISCUSS LATER. MAJOR NEW FEDERAL LAW. WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE PARTNERSHIPS THAT ALLOWED ALL OF THIS WORK TO MOVE FORWARD SIMULTANEOUSLY. IT. EXCUSE ME FOR MY TEAMS AT THE STATE LEVEL TO THE COUNTIES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS ON THE GROUND TO THE ADVOCATES WHO RAISE CRITICAL CONCERNS TO OUR ATTENTION INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE AND OF COURSE OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE AT OUR BEST WHEN WE ARE COLLABORATING TOGETHER TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. ALL OF THESE ARENAS. AS WE'VE IMPLEMENTED THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM OR C. C. R. OUR VISION HAS ALWAYS BEEN AT ITS HEART ABOUT EQUITY. DIVISION IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT EVERY CHILD SERVED BY THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM NEEDS. DESSERTS AND HAS THE ABILITY TO BE PART OF A LOVING FAMILY. TOWARD THAT VISION MANY OF THE REFORMS CONNECTED TO C. C. R. HAVE HELPED TO ENSURE THAT MORE CHILDREN ARE CONNECTED AND SUPPORTED INFAMILY SETTINGS IDEALLY AND MOST OFTEN THEIR OWN FAMILY AND EXTENDED FAMILY. POLICY CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN CENTRAL TO C. C. R. HAVE INCLUDED. A BROAD EXPANSION IN THE USE OF CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMING. CREATION OF AN EMERGENCY CARE GIVER PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO BE IMMEDIATELY PLACED WITH RELATIVES OR FAMILY MEMBERS. ESTABLISHING GREAT EQUITY FOR CHILDREN PLACED IN RELATIVES HOMES. ESTABLISHING A NEW HOME BASED FAMILY CARE RATE STRUCTURE WHICH IS GIANT TIED TO THE CHILD'S ASSESSED LEVEL OF NEEDS. EXPANDING THE INTENSIVE SERVICES FOSTER CARE PROGRAM SUPPORTING INNOVATIONS AND FAMILY FINDING AND RESOURCE PARENT RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. AND NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR CONGREGATE CARE PROVIDERS AIMED AT ENSURING THAT FACILITIES ARE PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY THERAPEUTIC SUPPORTS TO MEET INDIVIDUAL NEEDS. THE DEPARTMENT RECENTLY RELEASED AN ISSUE BRIEF WHICH HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE SUCCESSES OF CCAR AND THESE POLICIES TO DATE AND ALSO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE WORK THAT REMAINS TO BE DONE IN PARTNERSHIP. SOME OF THOSE SUCCESSES INCLUDE THAT YOUTH PLACEMENT INTO CONGREGATE CARE SETTINGS HAS DECREASED BY MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT. WELL PLACEMENT INTO HOME BASED SETTINGS HAS INCREASED. OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS IN FACT THERE HAS BEEN A 53% INCREASE IN YOUTH WHO HAVE HAD THEIR FIRST PLACEMENT WITH A RELATIVE OR EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBER AND A 92% INCREASE IN YOUTH WHOSE PREDOMINANT PLACEMENT IS WITH A RELATIVE OR EXTENDED IN. PLACEMENT STABILITY INDICATORS FOR CHILDREN REMAINING IN THEIR FIRST PLACEMENT HAVE ALSO CONTINUED TO GROW SO 75% OF YOUTH WHO HAVE THEIR FIRST PLACEMENT WITH A RELATIVE AND ARE STILL IN CARE TWELVE MONTHS LATER. ARE STILL WITH THAT RIGHT HOMES APPROVED EACH QUARTER HAS ALSO STEADILY INCREASED. MORE THAN 87% OF YOUTH IN SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS ARE RECEIVING CRITICAL MENTAL HEALTH AND THERAPEUTIC SERVICES. NOT SURPRISINGLY THERE'S ALSO BEEN A NOT INCREASE AND THE NUMBER OF FACILITIES WITH INTEGRATED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. IN TERMS OF STRENGTHENING THESE EFFORTS WE MUST CONTINUE TO UTILIZE FAMILY ENGAGEMENT AND SUPPORTS THAT ARE INDIVIDUALIZED TO THE CHILD WHENEVER POSSIBLE. IT'S ALSO CRITICAL THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER WITH OUR PARTNERS TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS GAPS IN OUR SYSTEMS OF CARE. OUR WORK ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHTY THREE WHICH MISSED FOURTH WILL SPEAK MORE ABOUT IS CENTERED AROUND THESE EFFORTS. WE ALSO NEED TO REDUCE THE LENGTH OF STAY AND S. T. R. T. P. IS THAT TOO MANY OF OUR YOUTH AND PARTICULARLY OUR BLACK YOUTH ARE STILL EXPERIENCING. AND FINALLY AS WE WILL DISCUSS MORE LATER WE ARE SUPPORTING AND WORKING TOGETHER WITH COUNTY SOME PROVIDERS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF YOUTH WITH COMPLEX CARE NEEDS. OUR GOALS INCLUDE STRENGTHENING PROACTIVE APPROACHES TO IDENTIFYING AND MEETING YOU NEEDS ACROSS THE SYSTEMS OF CARE AND BEFORE THEY REACHED A CRISIS. SO WITH THAT OVER ARCHING INTRODUCTION AND RESPONSE I WILL TURN IT OVER TO DEPUTY DIRECTOR INTO SPORTS TO TALK FURTHER ABOUT CRITICAL SUPPORTS HER FAMILY BASED CARE AND SOME ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON THE FUTURE. THANK YOU TEHERAN BLOOD MEANT THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND APPRECIATE AGAIN THE FOCUS ON THE VISION OF THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM. ACCEPTED AND ALL I'M GOING TO DIG INTO SOME OF THE SPECIFIC QUESTION POSED WITHIN THEIR GENDER WHICH CENTERED AROUND THE WORK WE ARE DEALING AND THE STRATEGIES THAT WE HAVE FOUND SUCCESSFUL. IN BUILDING FAMILY BASED CARE. PARTNERED ED ARE MOVING IN A VERY POSITIVE DIRECTION AND HAVE BEEN FOCUSED INTENTLY ON HOW TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE. THE NUMBER OF UNITS BEING CARED FOR IN FAMILY BASED PLACEMENT. I DO WANT TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION POSED IN THE AGENDA ABOUT THE CHANGE AND FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT EVERYTIME I'M EITHER WORKING IN A DECREASE IN THAT FAMILY BASED PLACEMENT. THE DATA CITED AND THE AGENDA BREAKS DOWN THE PERCENTAGES. I THANK I. IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN. AND THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. BUT FOR. WITH THE IF BY OUR NON MINOR DEPENDENT POPULAR. WHICH DID ACCESS IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN MOST OF THOSE NON MINOR DEPENDENT PUTS OUR YOUTH BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY ONE. ARE PLACED IN INDEPENDENT LIVING SETTING OUR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM. AS OPPOSED TO BEING IN FAMILY BASED PLACEMENTS WHICH IS MORE CONSISTENT BUT THEIR DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS. IF WE CALL THE NON MINOR DEPENDENTS OUT OF THE DATA NUMBER IT'S JUST THAT THE PLACEMENT FOR. THE SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD WE SEE AN INCREASE IN FAMILY BASED PLACEMENTS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN APART WITH SEVENTY TWO PERCENT. IN. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY WHERE WE'RE AT 78% IN TERMS OF WHAT IS A- TO THE THANK. WE FOUND SIX. WHEN FAMILY FINDING ENGAGE. INDIVIDUAL PARTICULARLY WHEN WE FOCUS ON THE CHILD ON FAMILY AND EXTENDED FAMILY INCLUDING A FOCUS. ON THE PATERNAL FAMILY ENGAGEMENT. TO DEFEND. THE SERVICE CONTRACTS AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT COUNTY AN INDIVIDUALIZED CHILD SPECIFIC RECRUITMENT. THINGS LIKE ARTIST PROGRAM WHICH SUPPORTS EXTENSIVE FAMILY FINDING ENGAGEMENT AND LYFT PERMANENT THESE SERVICES AND IS AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE TRAINING AND COACHING AS WELL AS CONDUCTING REGULAR WEBINARS. THAT ARE AVAILABLE ONLINE ON A RECORDED FOR THAT COUNTY USE THAN OTHERS CAN WATCH WHATEVER. WHENEVER THEY'RE ABLE TO SCALE THOSE WOMEN ARE COMPELLED TO FUND THINGS LIKE WORKING THREE ISSUE FOR GRIEF AND LOSS. GRIEF AND LOSS VERY. AND SPECIALIZED PERMANENCY SERVICES AND BEST PRACTICES. AROUND UP FRONT THE ONLY FINDING. WE ALSO PARTNERED WITH DALY FELICE. I COMMUNITY CAN FIRM THAT'S THE POINT COUNTY IN MICRO TARGET DID YOU RESTART RECRUITMENT WHICH IS THE WAY USING ANALYTICAL DATA TO TARGET HOMES THAT HAVE SPECIFIC CAPACITIES TO THIRD YOUTH WITH SPECIALIZED NEEDS. THIS IS RECRUITMENT WITH THE DIFFERENT POPULATION ALLOWING COUNTIES TO MARK THAT LABOR GROUP FAMILY JUST BEAR PEOPLE CONTENT THAT SERVICES NEEDS I THINK BACK POPULATION ARE THE ISSUES THAT ARE STEPPING DOWN FROM AN F. T. R. T. P. ANY USE OF THE DAILY SOLUTION- STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN VERY THINK THAT ALL TO GIVE YOU AN DEA OF THE CONTRACT THE STATE. WE HAVE SEEN ONE COUNTY HAVE A MEDICALLY FRAGILE USE REQUIRING AN INTENSIVE SERVICES FOSTER CARE HOME NOT ONLY DID THE COUNTY FIND A NURSE THAT HAD TRAINING SPECIFIC TO THE CHILD WE NEED- COULD BECOME THE REPORT THE ONLY FOR THAT CHILD THEY OFTEN REPEATS FIFTEEN ADDITIONAL THE- ANOTHER EXAMPLE ONE COUNTY PROBATION AGENCIES RAN A POPULATION SPECIFIC CAMPAIGNS. TO RECRUIT HOMES FOR TEENAGERS BETWEEN THE AGES OF FOURTEEN AND EIGHTEEN HADN'T CONSERVATIVES NEED. EVERYTHING THE. HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE TARGETED LEADS. THERE ARE WORKING WITH THE U. DAVIS MIND INSTITUTE. IN ORDER TO. A KEEP CALM. THROUGH THE OF LIFE EMPLACEMENT. FOR AND- YEAR THINGS LIKE AUTISM IN EDH. TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES AND A LOT FOR THE FACILITY YEAH THE DEPRESSION. AND AGAIN HAVE BEEN REAL SICK FAT- IN WORKING WITH THE TEAM IN ORDER TO YOU KNOW- CABLE LICENSE SUPPORT CHILDREN WE HAD. A SIX YEAR OLD WHO UNDIAGNOSED AUTISM IN A SEVERE EATING DISORDER IT WAS BROUGHT TO THE UC DAVIS. EMERGENCY RAM CAL THE NEVER BEEN IN SCHOOL OR RECEIVED ANY TREATMENT FOR AUTISM OR THE EATING PROBLEMS THAT WE WORK WITH THE UC DAVIS. MIND INSTITUTE TEAM. IN ORDER TO HELP PREPARE THAT USED FOR HOME BASED PLACEMENT BY IDENTIFYING INTERVENTIONS FOR THAT CHILD AND THAT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN CONNECTED WITH A FOSTER FAMILY- AND IS EATING AND THRIVING- AND HAS AND HAS HAD A- DRAMATIC DECREASE- IN VERBAL OUTBURSTS AND OTHER TRICKS ABOUT THE FED. AND THE GOAL FOR THAT YOUNG PERSON IS IT FOR UNIFICATION AND THE AND THE FATHER IS ALSO INVOLVED FINALLY WE HAVE FIFTEEN COUNTIES THAT HAVE DONE THINGS LIKE THEIR UP FRONT THE ONLY FINDING I LOOKED UP WE KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL COUNTY HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN TWENTY THOUSAND AND- SIX- THEY HAVE FOUND ACROSS THE TEN OFFICERS WERE THEY'VE IMPLEMENTED THE PILOT. BUT THEY CONSISTENTLY ARE CONNECTING BETWEEN SEVENTY FIVE AND 80% OF THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE TO RELATIVES INCLUSIVE OF THE NON OFFENDING PARENT RELATIVES AND EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS. THE FOURTEENTH ROUTE YOU TO THE SUCCESS OF ITS INDIVIDUALIZED CHILD SPECIFIC ENGAGEMENT SUPPORT WE'VE ALSO LEARNED THAT FINDING FAMILY IS NOT ENOUGH WE MUST ALSO DROPPED ADDRESS THE GAP IN THE SYSTEMS OF CARE. TO ENSURE THAT THE FAMILY THREE FEET THE ROBUST SUPPORT SERVICES THAT THEY REQUIRE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY. CARE FOR AND SUPPORT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE. OR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORK FOR BY A TWENTY EIGHTY. BUT FOR THAT AND ALL. THE GAPS WITHIN OUR SYSTEM OF. AND STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THEM. I'M ALL WORKING COULD COMPLETE THE DATA. AND DATA SHARING OUR SYSTEM. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED FOCUS AREAS THREE THE CHILD'S. TECHNICAL ASSISTANT CALL THE CONSISTENT THAT KERRY TEAM ENGAGES THEM. YOU KNOW NEED TO ADDRESS GIVE. IS- ONLY THING YET COMPLEX IS- INVOLVED IN MULTIPLE SYSTEMS AND WE KNOW THAT NO ONE SYSTEM CAN MEET ALL OF THE NEEDS. WE NEED TO IMPROVE OUR CLASS WITH THEM COMPETENCIES IN COLLABORATION TO MAKE SURE ALL OF THE SYSTEMS ARE WORKING TOGETHER- AND ADDRESS THE LACK OF ACCESS TO SPECIALIZED SERVICES FOR OUR- AND FEEDBACK POPULATION AND DUE TO THE FACT THAT HE SUPPORTERS AND OTHER. SPECIALIZED POPULATIONS OF WILD MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE INTENSITY AND FREQUENCY ESPECIALLY MENTAL. PEOPLE AND ENSURE THAT PERMANENT AND ENSURE THEIR PERMANENT CONNECTIONS TO FAMILIES. THE RESOURCES THAT WE REQUESTED PROCTOR CARE PLACEMENT SERVICES BCP ARE AIMED AT INCREASING OVERSIGHT OF PLACEMENTS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE CONNECTING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO FAMILY BASED PLACEMENTS WHENEVER POSSIBLE I'M AN EMPLOYEE BEING ANY AND YOU WANT TO STAY IN CONGREGATE CARE SETTING WE DO KNOW THROUGH THE DATA REPORT- THAT ABOUT 30% OF YOU ARE IN ARE AT YOUR T. P. OVER THE LAST YEAR HAVE BEEN CONGREGATE SETTINGS FOR ONE OR MORE YEAR IF WHICH IS CONTRARY. TO THE SHARED VISION THAT WE ALL HAVE- WITHIN PPR AND FELT MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOUBLING DOWN ON THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORT BUT I OUTLINED ABOUT IT CONNECTS CHILDREN TO FAMILIES AND SUPPORT CHILDREN IN THE FAMILY BASED PLACEMENT THE CRITICAL. DIVISION FTP ARE FOR ALL CHILDREN GROW UP IN LOVING FAMILY I'M NOT ESSENTIAL ALSO TO ENSURING EQUITY AND WELL BEING I THROUGHOUT OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS BUT WE'RE KEENLY AWARE TO PICK MORE DETAIL AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND ALL OF OUR PARTNERS TO CONTINUE. TO ACHIEVE THE VISION OF THE C. R. THANK YOU. DIRECTOR WILL HEAR FROM JUSTIN. WITH THE OF. YEAH YES JUST MARC- NO COMMENTS TO AND- THE GENIE OF THE- NARRATIVE THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT BUT HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE COMMITTEE AS NECESSARY. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM ANGELES SHORT WITH THE L. A. L. THANK YOU. YES AGAIN ANGELES SHORT WITH THE L. YOU JUST HEARD FROM- DFS WE ARE UNDOUBTEDLY MAKING PROGRESS TOWARD ACHIEVING THE GOALS OF C. C. R. INCLUDING REDUCING OUR STATE'S RELIANCE ON LONG TERM CONGREGATE CARE PLACEMENTS. AND INCREASING- INDIVIDUALIZED AND- TAUGHT IN FAMILY CENTERED CARE. THAT'S SAID- OUR COMMENTS TODAY ARE GOING TO FOCUS ON THOSE- AREAS OF CPR WHERE- THERE REMAINS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT OR PROGRESS TO BE MADE- SPECIFICALLY IT CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF C. C. R. SUCH AS UNIVERSAL USAGE. OF AND CONSISTENT REPORTING AROUND HOW TO FAMILY TEAM. AND CAN ASSESSMENT FOR CHILD AND ADOLESCENT NEEDS AND STRENGTHS ASSESSMENT. ARE THESE ELEMENTS REMAIN LESS THAN FULLY IMPLEMENTED WHILE OTHER ELEMENTS SUCH AS- RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL HAVE YET TO REACH THEIR GOALS. AND CONSIDERING NOT FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF CCR REALLY ARE IMPORTANT TO INSURE THAT WE CONTINUE MAKING PROGRESS TOWARD ACHIEVING THE GOALS OF C. C. R. THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT WHAT INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT OR GUIDANCE MAY BE NEEDED. REGARDING THE ELEMENTS THAT HAVE YET TO BE FULLY ROLLED OUT. OF FOR EXAMPLE. WHAT IF THE DENTIST FOR THE COUNTIES THAT FACE CHALLENGES INCLUDING ANY DATA SYSTEM AND REPORTING ISSUES. AROUND CHILD AND FAMILY TEAM AND CANS SUSTENANCE. WHAT IS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE CONSISTENT CAN STATE REPORTING ACROSS ALL COUNTY- SOME OTHER QUESTIONS FROM OUR INITIAL ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL- HAVE ALREADY BEEN SPOKEN TO TODAY SO I WON'T REITERATE THOSE. BUT I DID JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT ONE ADDITIONAL POINT RELATED TO- RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL OR RFA PROPOSES FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT BACKLOG OF RESOURCE FAMILY APPLICATION PENDING BEYOND NINETY DAYS. HOWEVER WE KNOW THAT BEGINNING JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO- STATUTE SPECIFIES THAT THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF TIME- THAT RELATIVE TO OUR EMERGENCY CARE GIVERS. AND RECEIVE STATE FUNDS FOR FOSTER CARE MAINTENANCE PAYMENTS PRIOR TO COMPLETING THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL WILL DECREASE TO NINETY DAYS. AND THIS IS A DECREASE FROM ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS- WITH THE OPTION OF A GOOD CAUSE EXTENSION UP TO THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS. ALLOWED IN THE CURRENT YEAR- RFA APPROVAL TIMES ARE TRENDING IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION HOWEVER THE MEDIAN APPROVAL TIME DOES REMAIN ABOVE NINETY DAYS- SO CONSIDERING THE CURRENT BACKLOG. AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT THE- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FUNDING WOULD NOT BE ALLOCATED UNTIL AFTER JULY FIRST- WHEN THE AMOUNT OF ALLOWABLE TIME FOR STATE FUNDS IS SET TO DECREASE. WE RECOMMEND A LEGISLATOR LEGISLATURE CONSIDER AMENDING STATUTE TO ALLOW FOR THE CONTINUATION- PROJECT WILL HAVE A GOOD BECAUSE EXTENSION OPTION ON AN ONGOING BASIS BUT ESPECIALLY DURING THE CURRENT PANDEMIC. THIS CHANGE WOULD ENSURE EMERGENCY CARE GIVERS ACROSS ALL COUNTIES. DON'T LOSE ACCESS TO STATE FUNDS FOR FOSTER CARE PAYMENTS IF THEY EXPERIENCE ANY DELAYS AND THE RESOURCE A- RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS. THANK YOU TO ANSWERING. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM KATHY SANDERLING MCDONALD'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST CAPPING CENTER LANGUAGE CW DNA. WE HAVE TO RESPOND TO A FEW QUESTIONS ON THE- I AM IN THE AGENDA TODAY FIRST OFF- WHAT COULD HELP ME SEE AND STILL BEING UNFINISHED BUSINESS WHEN IT COMES. CPR KELLY SERVICES AGENCIES AGREE THAT CCR HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. ADDED SHOOTING THE BALL SET FORTH IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION AND WHAT THAT. AND CAN I HAVE A SERVICES AGENCIES ARE REALLY PROUD OF THESE EFFORTS AND VALUE ARE STRENGTHENED PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS. COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS AND OTHER AGENCIES THAT WORK WITH US TO DELIVER SERVICES TO CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES. WE'VE CUT THE NUMBER CONGREGATE CARE PLACEMENTS ORE YOUTH AND FAMILIES ARE INVOLVED IN THEIR OWN SERVICE PLANNING TO CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMING AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO RAMP UP AT THE STATE REQUIRED. RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS. WE APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT DISCUSSING DATA BOTH ON THIS PANEL AS WELL AS OF THE FIRST PANELISTS WHILE I WANT TO KNOW WE'VE GOT SOME QUESTIONS REGARDING THE DATA. THAT WERE PRESENTED IN THE LARGER ISSUE BRIEF THAT THEY RELEASED OUT LAST WEEK AND PLAN TO ENGAGE WITH THEM AS WELL AS DR WEBSTER WHO YOU HEARD FROM ON THE FIRST CHANNEL. THAT SAID AS WE LOOK AT DATA WE DO STILL SEE AREAS WHERE THERE'S ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT AND AN UNFINISHED BUSINESS AT THE WORK. FIRST WE CONTINUE TO REDUCE STATE CONGREGATE CARE THERE'S- MORE PRESSURE ON OUR SYSTEM TO MAINTAIN. A ROBUST SUPPLIER FOSTER HOMES WHO ARE WILLING TO OPEN THEIR HEARTS AND HOMES OF FACIA. AND A GREAT NEED TO CONTINUE AND BETTER SUPPORT FAMILY CAREGIVERS. POINT IN TIME DATA AS OF OCTOBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE SHOWS THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF ALL PLACEMENTS THAT ARE WITH RELATIVES. HAVEN'T CHANGED ALL THAT MUCH TWENTY FIFTEEN. THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENT WAYS TO LOOK AT THE DATA OF COURSE BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THERE'S ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT AND HOW WE IDENTIFY. RECRUIT AND SUPPORT FAMILY CAREGIVERS I WILL TALK A BIT MORE IN JUST A FEW MINUTES ABOUT THE WAY THAT THESE EFFORTS CAN BE SUPPORT. AND OUT ONTO THE ISSUES DISCUSSED IN THE PRIOR PANEL AROUND DISPROPORTIONATE ALITY AND DISPARITIES. FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN AMERICAN INDIAN CHILDREN AS YOU DISCUSSED DISPROPORTIONATELY INCREASES AS THEY GO DEEPER IN THE CHILD WELFARE INCLUDING A CONGREGATE CARE THERE ARE NEARLY SIX TIMES AS MANY AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN IN CONGREGATE CARE AS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION AND FOUR POINT SIX TIMES AS MANY AMERICAN INDIAN CHILDREN. OF COURSE FOR US THE TCR TOPICS EATING FOR EVERYONE ESPECIALLY CHILDREN OF COLOR WE HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS IN ADDRESSING DISPARITIES THAT I'LL SHARE A PANEL THREE REGARDING THE OPPORTUNITY THAT THE FAMILY FIRST PREVENTION SERVICES ACT GIVES US. FOR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DEEPLY IMPACTED BY FOSTER CARE AND THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THE VSPHERE WHAT THE JUST ONE CHANGE IT WAS A SERIES OF MULTIPLE COMPLEX CHANGES THAT CONTINUE TO EVOLVE TO THIS DAY. SOME AREAS WHERE WE THINK CONTINUED WORKING IS TO BE DONE AND CLEARED LIKE I MENTIONED RECRUITING AND SUPPORTING FOSTER FAMILIES OF RELATIVE CAREGIVERS. IMPLEMENTING CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMING IN THE WAY THAT WE WOULD LIKE IT TO BE IMPLEMENTED SO THAT CHILDREN FAMILIES HAVE A TRUE VOICE IN THE PROCESS. BUILDING AND STRENGTHENING PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT SERVE OUR CHILDREN AND YOU. TO ENSURE THAT ROBUST SUPPORTS ARE AVAILABLE AND AVAILABLE TIMELY WHEN THEY'RE NEEDED. UNFORTUNATELY SERVICES ARE NOT ALWAYS READILY AVAILABLE IN THE HOME AS WE INVEST IN THE INITIALLY WITH THE C. R. WE THINK THAT THE CAL GAME SYSTEM BEING IMPLEMENTED AT DH CS. SHOWS GREAT PROMISE ENABLING OUR CHILDREN AND YOUTH. TO ACCESS THAT U. P. S. D. T. A TITLE MEANT. FOR FOSTER YOUTH FOR MENTAL HEALTH. CAN'T COUNTIES CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH SERVING FOSTER CHILDREN. THAT HAVE VERY INTENSIVE IN PUBLIC HEARING MENTAL HEALTH AND- DD RELATED ME. A TWENTY EIGHTY PASS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS THE SHORT SPECIAL REQUIRES THE CREATION OF BOTH STATE LEVEL AND LOCAL LEVEL BODIES WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM MULTIPLE SYSTEMS BUT THE WORK IS DEFINITELY I'M GOING IN THIS AREA. AND THAT'S SUPPORTING INTERVIEWS WITH THE MOST COMPLEX NEEDS FOR HOME AT LEAST ON A TEMPORARY BASIS I TAILORED SET OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS ARE NEEDED IN A MORE HIGH END PLACEMENT IN ORDER TO HELP THEM MOVE FORWARD AND STEPPED DOWN. INTO THE MOST FAMILY LIKE SETTING POSSIBLE. FINALLY WE BELIEVE IT MAKES SENSE TO REVIEW THE S. T. R. T. P. MODEL TOGETHER. WE WENT FROM A SYSTEM THAT HAD FOURTEEN RATE LEVELS AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF STRUCTURES THAT ARE CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES TO A ONE SIZE FITS ALL MODEL. DID WE GET IT RIGHT PROBABLY NOT ENTIRELY. PROPOSING A WORKGROUP THAT WOULD GET TOGETHER THAT HAS REPRESENTATIVES FROM ACROSS THE THAT COUNTIES AS WELL AS THE CHILD SERVING AGENCIES OF THE ALLIANCE SO YOU'LL HEAR FROM- NEXT ON THIS PANEL. WOULD ALLOW US TO REALLY. TURN THE BOTTLE AROUND AND TAKE THE TIME TO SEE WHAT WE GOT RIGHT BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. WHAT MIGHT NEED TO BE CHANGED IN PARTICULAR COUNTIES IN OUR SERVICE PROVIDER PARTNERS ARE STRONG AND TO RESPOND TO THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. THAT THE BUILDING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS FOR CHILDREN IN. CALIFORNIA DOESN'T HAVE A REALLY ROBUST RESIDENTIAL BASED ALTERNATIVE TO A PSYCHIATRIC LEVEL OF CARE THAT SPECIFICALLY OPERATED FOR CHILDREN. OTHER THAN AN EMERGENCY ROOM. AND WE KNOW THAT IF YOU'RE CHEAP EVEN FOR OUR STRUGGLING FOR VARIOUS REASONS TO MEET MOMENT. IT'S EASIER TO MEET THEM FOR VARIOUS REASONS WHICH I'M SURE NEXT PANELISTS WILL SHARE. IN ADDITION THE ANALYSIS- THAT IS REQUIRED BY EIGHTY TWENTY EIGHTY THREE OF NOW YEARS OF RETAIL AND SO IT REALLY I THINK IF THAT'S POSSIBLE SAYS. DO IT. TARGETED AND IDEALLY WAY REVIEW WHAT WE HAVE NOW. AND THINK ABOUT THE RESULT. THE FACT QUESTION A RELATED TO THE FAIR. THAT HAVE BEEN SIX. IN THE FAMILY BASE CARE AT HOW WE CAN BETTER SERVE. OUR FAMILY BASED CARE GIVERS. RCC ARE QUITE A NUMBER OF THINGS IN THE PLACE THAT WERE VERY HELPFUL IN ENABLING US TO RECRUIT AND SUPPORT FAMILY BASED CARE. THE PARTICULAR INCLUDE FOSTER PARENT RECRUITMENT RETENTION AND SUPPORT ALSO KNOWN AS THE FIFTH FIRST FUNDING AS WELL AS THE STATE WIDE IN ASPEN OF RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL A NEW WAY FOR US TO LICENSE AN APPROVED. FOSTER PARENTS AND RELATIVE CAREGIVERS. THE FIRST PROGRAM PROVIDED US WITH A VERY- SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING AND IT COULD BE BROADLY YEARS TO BOTH OF RECRUIT AND RETAIN AND SUPPORT OUR FOSTER FAMILIES. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES OF WHAT COUNTIES HAVE DONE WITH THESE FUNDS WHICH HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL BUT- UNFORTUNATELY NO LONGER AVAILABLE TO OUR MEMBERS. THE FUNDS I'M SHALLOW DOUBTS OVER TIME AND THEN THEY WERE ZEROED OUT STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND NOW AGAIN HERE AT TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW. THERE IS NO FUNDING IN THIS AREA. WHAT WE'VE LEARNED SO IS AS WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN RECRUITING AND SOCIALLY FAMILY BASED CARE RELATIVE AND NOT RELATED EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS. THEY ARE TYPICALLY SERVING. CHILDREN IN THE FAMILY. THANK THEY KNOW THE CHILDREN THEY THE FAMILIES AND- WHILE THEY ARE THERE FOR US AND THERE FOR THE CHILDREN WHILE THEY'RE IN THE HOME. IDEALLY THE CHILDREN ARE REUNIFIED WITH THEIR BIOLOGICAL FAMILIES OR SOME OTHER PERMANENCY THE CHEAPER AFTER GUARDIANSHIP. AND THEN WE HAVE SEEN THOSE FAMILIES EXIT THE SYSTEM THEY DON'T REMAIN IN THE SYSTEM TYPICALLY TO BE CARE GIVERS TWO OTHER CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT PART OF THEIR FAMILY. AND SO WHEREAS I THINK AT THE BEGINNING A FEW C. R. IT WAS BELIEVED THAT WE COULD KIND OF RECRUIT CADRE OF FOSTER PARENTS. THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE BEARING THEY WOULD BE THIS KIND OF ONGOING RESOURCE FOR US. IT TURNED OUT THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE REPLENISHING THAT RECRUITMENT AND THOSE SUPPORT TO BE ABLE TO SERVE VERY SPECIFIC CHILDREN IN OUR SYSTEM AND THEN CONTINUE TO DO THAT OVER TIME IT'S NOT BEEN. SORT OF A. ONE AND DONE AS I THINK WE HAD EXPECTED. WE ALSO FEEL THAT WE LAST FOR WITH THE P. AND WHEN WE WALK THAT FUNDING FOR THE FOR THE PAPERS. HELLO YOU FROM REPORTING SEEING DROPS IN AVAILABLE RESOURCE FAMILIES WHO ARE NOT RELATED TO CHILDREN IN CARE. OF A LOT OF OUR LONG TIME RESEARCH FAMILIES RETIRED DUE TO THE PANDEMIC IT WAS STRESSFUL- WE JUST SAW A LOT OF LOT OF LONGSTANDING FAMILIES ACROSS COUNTY. AND SO WE'RE FOR- CONTINUED FUNDING OR RESTORED FUNDING OF A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND FOR FAVORS- THIS IS ENOUGH THAT WERE CO SPONSORING WITH THE- COUNTY PROBATION CHIEF OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS AS HERE YOU STATE COUNCIL. AND I'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE SOME EXAMPLES OF SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN USE THE FUNDING FOR- I JUST A COUPLE AND WE CAN PROVIDE THAT THE FULL LIST TO THE COMMITTEE AFTER. IS IN ADDITION TO EXPANDING KINSHIP FOCUS SUPPORT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE REALLY KIÞM CIVIL SUPPORT. AND ASSISTANCE TO FAMILIES TO GET THEIR HOMES APPROVED. IT MIGHT INCLUDE- BETH. OR A QUICK MINUTE- PLAYPENS OTHER MATERIALS IN THE HOME SO THAT A RELATIVE IS ABLE TO QUICKLY. I THINK APPROVAL AND BECOME APPROVED AS A RESOURCE FAMILY- AT TIMES IT'S REQUIRED HOUSING REPAIRS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT THERE ARE. LICENSING REQUIREMENTS THAT MUST BE BACK. IN ALL HOPES INCLUDING RELATIVES ABOUT RELATED EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS. WE'VE ALSO PAID THE- RESPITE CARE TAKE CARE GIVERS SOMETHING THAT WE LEARNED AS WE'VE IMPLEMENTED. THE FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM. OF WHICH WAS CHAMPIONED BY SHARE ARAMBULA AND HAS ABOUT- BEGAN TO BE IMPLEMENTED. IS THAT RIGHT BUT IT IS. A REAL AN ONGOING NEED. FOR STRESSED CAREGIVERS AND IT ALSO GIVES YOU A BREAK. AS WE MAY SEE- YOU KNOW KIND OF INCIDENTS OR DISAGREEMENTS OCCUR. THAT COULD RESULT IN THE DESTRUCTION OF THE PLACEMENT. BEING ABLE TO SORT OF- HAVE SOMEONE WHO CAN. HELP STEP IN AND NOT JUST ARRANGE TREATMENT OR OTHER SERVICES BUT ALSO- TEMPORARILY- FOR A VERY SHORT TERM CARE FOR THAT. YEAR IS UP IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. SO- THE OTHER AREA THAT WE ARE- SEEKING ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS FOR THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL AS I MENTIONED. BOB AS YOU KNOW THIS IS A HUGE CHANGE TO HOW WE LICENSE AN APPROVED FOSTER PARENTS ESPECIALLY FOR OUR RELATIVE CAREGIVERS. SPONSORED THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION- IT WAS A BACK IN THE- OFFICE IT WAS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY TEN YOU KNOW THAT IN TWENTY ELEVEN WE REALIGN THE REMAINDER OF CHILD WELFARE UNDER THE TWENTY WHAT THAT. REALIGNMENT AT THAT TIME- IT WAS NOT A CANDIDATE FOR EVERY COUNTY TO DO RFA FIFTY THREE ARE LEGISLATION AND- TWENTY FIFTEEN I'M MADE OF THE STATEWIDE REQUIREMENTS AND WE- I KNOW WHAT WE KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH IS BEING SPENT. WARRANT AREN'T PAID BY COUNTIES BECAUSE WE HAVE A TRUE UP. STATUTORILY REQUIRED PROCESS THAT IS RELATED TO OPPOSITION THIRTY THAT REQUIRES FUNDING OF A NEW REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE ENACTED AFTER TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT. AND SO IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR- WE APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION APPROVING EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CURRENT YEAR ON A ONE TIME BASIS FOR THAT. OF A COUNTIES ARE USING THESE FUNDS- TO OFFSET THE OTHERWISE UNFUNDED. ARCTIC IT IS A SIGNIFICANT THOUGH AN ALL INVEST. AND WE KNOW THAT THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE THIS FUNDING BECAUSE IT CARRIES A SHIFT THEIR RESOURCES AWAY FROM OTHER TYPES OF SERVICES IN ORDER TO COVER THAT. UP AND IT NEEDS TO BE AN ONGOING FUND. AND THEN FINALLY THE THIRD QUESTION IS RELATED TO ENSURING THAT THEIR SUFFICIENT EMERGENCY PLACEMENTS FOR YOU. TO COME INTO THE SYSTEM AND EXPECTEDLY ESPECIALLY THOSE ON A RELATIVE WHO ARE WILLING OR ABLE TO CARE FOR THEM. AND AT TIMES WE HAVE NOTICED THAT WERE ABOUT TO I NEED TO BRING A CHILD INTO CUSTODY FOR THEIR SAFETY. IT CAN HAPPEN UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IT CAN HAPPEN ON THE WEEKEND WE MAY NOT IMMEDIATELY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT FAMILY AND WHO. WOULD BE A GOOD. PLACE MATT WAS PART OF THE FAMILY ARE NOT RELATED EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBER. SO IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THAT WE WORK WITH THE STATE WILL WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS NEEDED TO DEVELOP AND FUNDING OPTIONS FOR COUNTIES TO SAFELY. TEMPORARILY PLACE CHILDREN IN UGANDA DIVERSITY BATES SAID IF A RELATIVE OR OTHER POTENTIAL. CARE GIVER IS NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE. WHEN I FOR STARTED IT W. D. MORE THAT YEARS MANY COUNTIES OPERATED SHELTERS. WHERE CHILDREN COULD BE TAKEN FOR SHORT TERM STAYS. AND TYPICALLY WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THOSE CHILDREN WHO HAD JUST ENTERED THE SYSTEM. LACK OF TALKING ABOUT- OVER TIME THE MOST COUNTIES HAVE CLOSE THE TEMPORARY SHELTERS. THERE WERE CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT THE LENGTH OF STAY AND WHETHER THERE WERE ADEQUATE SERVICES BEING PROVIDED THERE. THERE ARE EIGHT COUNTIES THAT CONTINUE TO OPERATE A MODIFIED TEMPORARY TEN DAY SHELTER TYPE FACILITY FOR MOST NO LONGER HAVE THE FACILITY. SO WHAT WE'VE ALSO SEEN IN RECENT YEARS IS THAT YES CHILDREN BECOME INDICATOR UNEXPECTEDLY BUT ALSO WE HAVE COUNTIES REPORTING A GROWING NUMBER OF SITUATIONS. WHERE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE MOST COMPLEX NEEDS. THAT ARE IN A PARTICULAR PLACE AND OFTEN A CONGREGATE CARE PLACEMENTS HAVE AN INCIDENT OR DISAGREEMENT OF HER. AND AS A RESULT THE CAREGIVER OR PROVIDER ASKED THE COUNTY TO COME AND GET THE YOUTH LITTLE NOTICE. AND MANY COUNTIES ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND A QUICK ALTERNATIVE PLACEMENT FOR TREATMENT AND SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE. YOU HAVE AS A RESULT. OF THE SITUATION FOR YOU BECAUSE I COUNTY OFFICE OR IN A HOTEL WITH TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. SOCIAL WORKER SUPPORT. BUT NOBODY WANTS TO HAVE THESE PLACES HAPPENED THIS IS NOT A PLACE WHERE TREATMENT AND HEALING CAN HAPPEN THESE ARE NOT PLACES THAT WE CAN LIKE THAT. OR THAT WE WANT TO PLACE CHILDREN. SO WE PROPOSE THAT WE WORK TOGETHER WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER AGENCIES THAT SERVE. OUR CHILDREN AND USE THAT JUST COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. THE REGIONAL CENTERS IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM TO TRY TO DEVELOP MORE OPTIONS. WHAT I ACTUALLY THINK WORTH EXPLORING IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF WHAT WE'RE CALLING AN INTENSIVE. ASSESSMENT TRANSITIONAL TYPE OF FACILITY OR HOME. THESE ARE THE SHORT TERM SERVICE RICH JOINTLY STAFFED BY THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES THAT I MENTIONED. WHILE WE- AND SO THEY WOULD ENSURE THAT SERVICES ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDED WHILE CATHOLIC COUNTY CHILD WELFARE AGENCY. IS WORKING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I GOT. APPROPRIATE SAKE ONGOING PLACE. SO WE THINK THAT IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THESE COUNTY BAY. TYPES OF HOME WE WERE ALSO BETTER. FROM WORKING WITH THE STATE TO IF WE DEVELOP. A OF REACH OF OMAHA AS WELL NOT A COUNTY COULD RELEASE- THAT THAT TIME KIND OF. WE ALSO THINK MORE WORK NEEDS TO DONE TO A PLACE SURVEY. MUCH MORE QUICKLY WHEN A CHILD IS BORN UNTO CARE. THIS WOULD INCLUDE BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO. SUPPORTING FAMILIES WHO AGREED TO ACCEPT YOU FROM LITTLE NOTICE. THIS COULD BE SOMETHING WE COULD USE FOR EXAMPLE THE PEPPERS FUNDING THAT I MENTIONED FOR WE ALSO TO LOOK AT RESTRUCTURING THE NAME OF COUNTIES TO PARTNER. WITH RESOURCE FAMILIES TO HOLD EMERGENCY PLACEMENTS AVAILABLE FOR COUNTY. WE ALSO KNOW THAT I FUNDING RFA THAT IS THE PROCESS THAT BEGAN AS A SHORT NOTED. THAT HE MET. PRIOR TO APPROVAL FOR RELATIVES. AND SO ALLOWING GROWERS SHOULD IMMEDIATELY TOGETHER FUNDING SUPPORT. WE NEED TO HAVE ADEQUATE RFA STAFF TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN BEGIN AND COMPLETE THE PROCESS TIMELY. AS YOU HERE THERE IS A CERTAIN POINT AT WHICH THE FUNDING IF THAT TO TURN OFF IF IT CHANGES NOT MAY. AND THEN FINALLY FAMILY FINDING AND GIVEN SUPPORT WHAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT A FEW TIMES ON THESE FIRST TWO CANDLES. THERE'S A REALLY GREAT VALUE OF THIS HOW DO YOU THINK IN THE SEARCH AS SOON AS THE UTERUS CARE. AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF EVIDENCE BASED MODELS ONE THAT WE KNOW OF THAT A LOT OF COUNTY USE OF CALLED THIRTY DAYS TO FAMILY. PROGRAMS LIKE THIS PROVIDE GUIDELINES FOR SEARCHING AND SUPPORTING RELATED FAMILY MEMBERS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT JUST FINDING A PERSON IS NOT ENOUGH. AT THAT POINT YOU ALSO NEED TO ENGAGE WITH THEM. THEY MAY NOT KNOW THAT THEY EVEN HAVE A RELATIVE. WHO IT HAS A CHILD AND A CHILD WHO HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN THE FOSTER CARE DUE TO ABUSE OR NEGLECT OR BOTH. AND SO REACHING OUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT- WE HAVE TO DO WHAT I REALLY A THOUGHTFUL WAY. TO EXPLAIN WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE FAMILY I TRIED SHE BROKE MAKE A CONNECTION BETWEEN THAT RELATIVE. AND THAT CHILD ABUSE. EVEN. IF IT DOESN'T RESULT IN A PLACE. WE WERE STILL WANT TO POTENTIAL PRESERVE AFTER THAT. AND SO FOR FINE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT LAYERS TO IT NOT JUST I KNOW RELATIVE. SPEAKING WORKED OUT. THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE WITH THESE. TO ENSURE THAT THEY WERE STEP IN. AND BECOME A KEY. THAT FOR THE YOU. AND SO WE ARE. INVESTMENT OF FIFTEEN POINT YOU. GENERAL FUND TO HELP DIRECTLY THIS WORKING WHICH WOULD BE NEW FUNDING AT THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY DIRECTLY FUND- OUT WITH THAT. I WILL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS ON THE THREE QUESTIONS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND OF COURSE BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM CHRIS STONER MARKS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR. CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH TERROR ARAMBULA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- SO HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY. I'M GONNA JUST TURN MY TALKING POINTS HERE. SORRYHAVING A JUST A MOMENT OF TECH TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES JUST ONE MOMENT. MY APOLOGIES I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S HAPPENING CAN'T HANG ON ONE MOMENT. I'M HAD LOST MUCH LOCKING POINTS FIRST. I'M NOT SURE ABOUT IT- TO GETS HIS BACK UP HANG ON. IF IT'S OKAY I'LL BRING IT UP TO THE DÍAS AND WILL COME BACK TO YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY EITHER NOW OR IN FUTURE PANEL SAYS. TO ALLOW YOU TO WORK ON THE TALKING POINT IF THAT'S OKAY. UP THAT SHE CERTAINLY. OKAY CL JUST TAKE ME THIRTY SECONDS TO GET IT BACK HOLDEN WE CAN WAIT THIRTY SECONDS SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE IN ORDER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE. I'M GONNA JUST TALK THE WITHOUT MY TALKING POINTS- AS I'M HAVING TROUBLE GETTING THE LOVE OF MY COMPUTER HERE BUT I WANT TO JUST THANK AGAIN THE COMMITTEE. FOR YOUR TIME TODAY OF WE HAVE ALLOWED THE ALLIANCE HAS PUT TOGETHER A- A DOCUMENT CALLED KEEPING USED AT HOME- AND IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF AREAS. THAT WE HAVE FOUND OF OUR GAPS IN SERVICES AND POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS. ISSUES FACING MANY OF OUR YOUTH AND FAMILIES- AS WE LOOK TO INCREASE AND THE INITIATIVES ACROSS THE STATE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES FACING CHILDREN FAMILIES. WE HAVE FOUND IT CRITICAL TO INTEGRATE SERVICES- ACROSS SYSTEMS SO GETTING AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THE LOCAL LEVELS BOTH- THE- CARE THREW CAL AIM THROUGH- THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY SCHOOLS EFFORTS AND THROUGH MANY OTHER EFFORTS LIKE THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER. TO ADDRESS THE INTEGRATION OF SYSTEMS- AS WE LOOK AT THE GAPS THAT STILL EXIST IN C. C. R. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF- AREAS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. TO START WITH WE REALLY FOCUSED THIS IN THREE DIFFERENT AREAS- THE FIRST OF WHICH IS FAMILY FINDING AN ENGAGEMENT- AS MISS UNDERLING SAID FAMILY FINDING ENGAGEMENT. IS CRITICAL TO ADDRESSING THE ISSUES AROUND EQUITY TO ADDRESSING GETTING FAMILIES AND YOUTH TO BE TOGETHER WE- WE HAVE ACTUALLY A BUDGET REQUEST FOCUSED ON THOSE CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN IN CARE. FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME. AND WHO HAVE NOT. HAD VERY SPECIFIC PERMANENCY PLAN PUT IN PLACE SO WE ARE LOOKING UP FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT GRANTS TO COUNTIES AND PROVIDERS TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN IN FOSTER CARE FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME GET THOSE THAT SUPPORT TO IDENTIFY FAMILY MEMBERS AND OTHERS. BOB SO THAT THEY CAN IN FACT BE CONNECTED AND HOPEFULLY EVENTUALLY ACTUALLY BE REUNITED WITH FAMILY THE SECOND AREA THAT WE FEEL IS CRITICAL TO ADDRESS IS THE FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES WHO HAVE REALLY FOCUSED THEIR ATTENTION. ON PROVIDING INTENSIVE SERVICES FOSTER CARE. THIS IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF THE CONTINUUM OF CARE AND WE HAVE TO GET THIS RIGHT. IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT CHILDREN ARE BEING MOVED OUT OF RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES AN END TO FAMILY BASED CARE- FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES ARE SERVING CHILDREN WHO ARE OLDER FOSTER YOUTH THEY'RE SERVING CHILDREN. WHO HAVE MEDICAL MEDICAL NEEDS THAT ARE VERY SPECIALIZED THEY ARE SERVING- L. G. B. T. YOUTH AND- THIS THESE AGENCIES DO NOT HAVE THE SUPPORT HAVE NOT HAD A ON GOING- COST OF LIVING INCREASE AND SO WE ARE REQUESTING AN AND APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO SUPPORT ON THIS THAT WE MUST ENSURE THAT WHILE THE STATE IS WORKING ON THE- CHANGES TO THE LEVEL OF CARE. THAT WE PROVIDE A SHORT TERM. TEMPORARY COST OF LIVING INCREASE TO THESE ORGANIZATIONS. FINALLY WE MUST ADDRESS THE CRITICAL BEHAVIOR HEALTH NEEDS OF CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE AND THAT. IS FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON OUR S. T. OR TNCS ANTHONY TO PROVIDE SHORT TERM CRISIS RESIDENTIAL SERVICES FOR NOT JUST FOSTER YOU THOUGHT ALL USED WE- R. S. T. R. T. P.'S HAVE STRUGGLED MIGHTILY THROUGH KOPEN- WE HAVE. THEY HAVE STRUGGLED WITH INCREASED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ACCREDITATION- HAVING MENTAL HEALTH CONTRACTS FOR MANY OF THEM- MUCH MORE OVERSIGHT THAN CERTAINLY MANY OF THEM SAW OF PRIOR TO THIS YOU SEE ARE. AND INSTEAD OF HAVING A- PROCESS WHERE SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED WE HAVE SEEN MUCH MORE COMPLIANCE AND REGULATORY FOCUSED AND WE NEED TO REALLY LOOK AT WAYS TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEM. PRIMARILY WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE RATE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN PAID WHICH AS WE LOOK AT THE LEVEL OF MATURITY OF CHILDREN THAT ARE PLACED AND ASKED YEAR GP'S- AS MISS SANDERLING SAID WAIT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT VERY INDIVIDUALIZED CARE. AND MORE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT. GIVEN THE CURRENT RATE STRUCTURE THAT EXISTS FOR US TO YOUR GPS. WE THERE IS ALSO NO CLEAR AND CONSISTENT METHODOLOGY FOR FUNDING OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THESE PROGRAMS SO YOU WOULD SEE A VERY WIDE RANGE. OF THE KINDS OF SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED IN TERMS OF MENTAL HEALTH WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW WE CREATE A CONSISTENCY ACROSS THESE PROGRAMS. BOB AND FINALLY AND WITH THE BIG THANKS TO ASSEMBLY. MEMBER RAMOS WE ARE ALSO CRITICALLY IN NEED. OF THOSE CRISIS RESIDENTIAL SERVICES AND AN AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTEEN WOULD HELP US ACCOMPLISH THAT. SO WOOD THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE LOTS OF SUCCESS IS JUST HAVE BIRTH WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO TOGETHER. AND AGAIN INTEGRATION IS CRITICAL BOTH AT THE STATE AND THE COUNTY LEVELS WITH THE PROVIDERS WHO ARE WHO ARE ON THE GROUND SERVING THESE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR AND NOT HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH THAT I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DÍAS TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS WE WILL BEGIN WITH DOCTOR WHAT YES IT'S A QUESTION AND IT GOT MY ATTENTION- THERE WAS A REFERENCE BY KATHY- CERTAINLY MCDONALD ABOUT A BILL TWENTY EIGHTY THREE THAT HAD REPORT THIS YEAR'S OVERDUE- HOW DO WE GET THAT REPORT EXPEDITED AND COMPLETED- IT'S KIND OF DISCOURAGING. THE CARD ACTUALLY WHAT DONE I JUST KIND OF IT'S PRETTY DISCOURAGING THAT LEGISLATION CALLS FOR SOMETHING AND IT- IT'S OVERDUE AND- SOMEBODY COULD SOMEBODY ANSWER THAT PLEASE. BECAUSE WILL BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU A DUE DATE LIKE. YEARS AGO. WHAT I'D LOOK TOWARD CDSS IF WE COULD GET A RESPONSE. PREVIOUSLY THE OUTSIDE CHEN ARE GOING TO TRY. WE CAN TAG TEAM AND G. M. I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER WHITE AND THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF WORK THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING IN RESPONSE TO AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY EIGHTY THREE- THERE WERE TWO REPORTS THAT WERE REQUIRED BY THE LEGISLATION THE FIRST REPORT IS ALREADY COMPLETED. THE SECOND REPORT IS THE ONE THAT MISSED CENTER THAN MCDONALD'S WAS REFERRING TO AND WORK HAS ALREADY BEGUN ON THAT REPORT IN ADDITION- FOLKS CDSS AND THE NUMBER OF OUR AGENCY PARTNERS WITHIN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- WORK TOGETHER VERY COLLABORATIVELY AND CONSISTENTLY AMONGST THE STATE TEAM AS WELL AS WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS.AND OTHER PARTNERS TO WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER TO STRENGTHEN OUR RESPONSES REGARDING THE OVERALL SYSTEM OF CARE. SPOTS IN THE SLED. AND WE DID NOTIFY- FOLKS THAT THAT REPORT WAS GOING TO BE LATE IT'S REALLY THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE THAT- INTERRUPTED THE PROGRESS ON THAT REPORT AS WELL AS THE NEED TO STRENGTHEN OUR DATA ACROSS THE SYSTEM SO THAT WE COULD. PAINT A COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF ANY OF THE GAPS IN THE SYSTEM OF CARE SO WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT DATA MAPPING. AND DATA SHARING AGREEMENTS AMONG THE AGENCIES TO MORE FULLY PAINT THAT PICTURE STUFF QUITE A BIT OF WORK IS HAPPENING AND THAT LEGISLATION HAS ALREADY MADE AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE. WE ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO COMPLETING THAT SECOND REPORT- THAT AND WAS WHY DO YOU. AND HAS NOT YET BEEN PROVIDED- MISS WORDS I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WAS ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANTED TO ADD. THAT NUMBER THAT NOTHINGBAD THANK YOU. FOLLOW UP PLEASE SO WHAT CAN I FOLLOW UP PLEASE- TO WIN WAS THE REPORT DO. DURING JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY SIR. HI THIS IS KATHY WE WERE THAT- SPONSORS OF THE LEGISLATION SO WHICH ONE IS THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOLEY THANK YOU SO THAT WAS PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC- AND SO. I GUESS I'M JUST SO NOW WE'RE- MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY TO RECOGNIZE WE HAD A PANDEMIC WE HAVE WE WERE IN A PANDEMIC BUT THE REPORT WAS OVERDUE ON JANUARY BEFORE ANY OF THIS STARTED. SO. AND I WHAT I HEARD- WAS IT. YOU'RE STARTING THE WORK ON THAT THAT'S WHAT I HEARD- AND STARTING TO WORK STARTING THE WORK ON A PURPORTED WAS DUE TO YEARS AGO. THAT DOESN'T SHOW A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENT- AND THE AND THE EXPECTATION OF THE LEGISLATION SO- DO WE HAVE A DATE WHEN THAT REPORT IS GOING TO BE COMPLETED. IF I CLARIFY THAT ACTUALLY THE REPORT THAT WAS DUE JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY IS THE REPORT THAT ONCE COMPLETED- THE REPORT THE FOLLOW UP REPORT WAS DUE IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY BUT I TAKE YOUR POINT I'M NOT NONETHELESS THAT WITH THAT TIMING. I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE A DATE AT THIS TIME AND I O JUST WANT TO RE EMPHASIZE THAT WAS NOT MEETING TO SUGGEST THAT WE WERE BEGINNING TO WORK ON THE REPORT WHEN I WAS TRYING TO EMPHASIZE WAS THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT. OF WORK IN RESPONSE TO THAT LEGISLATION THAT HAS BEEN MAKING A DIFFERENCE AND THAT THAT IS- IN ADDITION TO ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO GATHER THAT DATA TO SUBMIT THAT REPORT SO WE DON'T HAVE A DATE TO OFFER YOU RIGHT NOW BUT CERTAINLY WILL GO BACK TO OUR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY WHICH HAS BEEN. COORDINATING THIS WORK AND- SEE HOW QUICKLY WE CAN TRY TO GET YOU AN ESTIMATED TIME FRAME. COULD WE MAYBE GET THAT ALL THE OTHER THROUGH THE CHAIR MAYBE WE CAN ASK FOR A BY THE EIGHT BY EIGHT SORT BY DATE CERTAIN THAT WOULD BE. THANK YOU. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO. JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THE- THE QUESTION BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD- WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS YOU STATED SPECIFICALLY THAT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC WHATEVER ELSE THAT COMMENT WAS YOU KNOW WE'RE USING THE PANDEMIC AS AN EXCUSE FOR NOT- A PROVIDING US THE INFORMATION AND- IT'S EVEN WORSE THAT NOW WE DON'T HAVE AN ESTIMATED DATE AS TO WHEN THIS IS GOING TO BE- PROVIDED SO WE STARTED. THE ONE REPORT WAS DUE JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY THE OTHER ONE JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY- AND HERE WE ARE TWO YEARS LATER AND YOU STILL DON'T HAVE A DATE AS TO WHEN THAT'S GOING TO BE COMPLETED AND I CAN APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE SAYING TO US THAT IT HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE BUT WITHOUT A REPORT YOU COULD BE SAYING ANYTHING AND WE WOULD NOT DOUBLE THE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO- BASICALLY LET US KNOW THAT THE WORK IS HAPPENING YOUR WORD. I DO I APPRECIATE YOU SAYING IT BUT THE WORD DOES NOT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOU'RE TWO YEARS LATE THAN THE WORDS REALLY DON'T MEAN ANYTHING BECAUSE NOW WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN FRONT OF US TO PROVE THAT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE AND THE TREMENDOUS OF WORK HAS BEEN MAKING A DIFFERENCE. YOU KNOW THESE ARE. PEOPLE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH AND YOU KNOW THE REPORT IS FOR US TO BE BETTER INFORMED TO HELP YOU THIS IS NOT JUST THAT WOULD SOME RANDOM REPORT. THAT WE'RE ASKING THIS IS TO ASSIST YOU IN WE CANNOT ASSIST. IF THE REQUIRED REPORTS ARE NOT BEING- FOLLOW THROUGH WITH. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE DO AGREE WITH YOU ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE REPORT AND WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE ABOUT THE TIMING OF IT SUBMITS. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND IN REFERENCE TO THE SHORT TERM THERAPEUTICAL PROGRAMS AND SPECIFICALLY TO THE YOUTH POPULATION- SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE SEEN. OVER THE YEARS AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO- BRING SOME CLOSURE TO. BUT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES. IN ADDRESSING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES- AND PARTICULARLY WITH THE YOUTH- DURING OUR SHORT TERM THERAPEUTICAL PROGRAMS AND I KNOW- I'M- ALSO. TALKING ABOUT. AN EPIDEMIC I THINK IS ALSO GOING ON WITH THE OPIOIDS AND OVERDOSES WITH FAT AND ALLS. AND LOOKING TO THESE ADDRESSES SOME OF THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS HERE. SO I WANTED TO GET SOME FEEDBACK ON THAT I KNOW THAT WE ARE- ENGAGED IN THAT WE DO HAVE A BILL THAT'S MOVING. BUT WE ALSO WANT TO HEAR. FROM THOSE ON THIS PANEL OF WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES AND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE AREAS THAT WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING. TRYING TO BE MORE PROACTIVE OR SEEN SOME THINGS OF THE PAST THAT WE NEED TO BE ADDRESSING NOW. HAPPY TO ADDRESS THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS- THERE ARE SOME REAL CHALLENGES. AROUND THE RATE STRUCTURES ASSOCIATED WITH SUBSTANCE USE SERVICES- UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND THE INTEGRATION OF THOSE SERVICES AND TEST YOUR GP'S BECOMES VERY COMPLEX WERE ACTUALLY IN THE MIDST OF STUDYING MATHS. AT THE ALLIANCE SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND- EITHER REGULATORY BARRIERS THAT EXIST. TO PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES- GROUP THAT ASKED YEAR TP STRUCTURE OR IF THERE ARE OTHER TYPES OF STRUCTURES. AND PROGRAMS THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT BUT BECAUSE WE KNOW. THAT IT IS A CRITICAL NEED WHEN YOU CAN LOOK IT USE THAT ARE. THAT ARE STRUGGLING THE MOST WITH SOME OF THESE COMPLEX NEEDS THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED- IT IT IS OFTEN. SUBSTANCE USE IS ONE OF THOSE ISSUES AT LEAST ONE- FOLLOWED MISTER CHAIR ON ON SOME OF THE DIFFERENT- FUNDING AVAILABILITY STATE FEDERAL. IS SOME OF THE DIFFERENT- DEFINITIONS THAT ARE BEING USED TO ENTERING- GETTING RESOURCES TO THOSE THAT ARE DRASTICALLY IN NEED OF THE RESOURCE AND AGAIN SPECIFICALLY WITHIN THE YOUTH POPULATION. HER ANSWER. DEPUTY DIRECTOR SHORT I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S THE FUNDING STREAMS THEMSELVES I THINK BUT I WOULD SAY THE GAPS THAT WE HAVE OBSERVED- ARE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT. THERE WE'RE TRYING TO SUPPORT THE YOUTH ACROSS- MULTIPLE FIRST DOWNS- AND NEED TO HAVE COMPETENT PEOPLE THAN THOSE SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO ATTRACT. LIFE NEEDS OF THE POPULATION AND INCREASE THE INTENSITY AND FREQUENCY OF SOME OF THE SERVICES THAT WE KNOW THAT WE NEED BUT ALSO JUST REITERATE THAT WHAT WE'RE FINDING THEM I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY THE VERY INDIVIDUALIZED. APPROACHES AND DEVELOPMENT OF THINGS LIKE THE ACT YOUR TEETH NEEDS OF ONE I'M SOME OF THE WORK THAT I DETAILS THAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH BAD UC DAVIS MIND INSTITUTE AND SOME OF THE VERY CHILD SPECIFIC- RECRUITMENT AND SUPPORT OF BAD NEWS BUT WE THINK THE FACT THAT. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE REALLY THERE WE'VE BEEN DOUBLING DOWN ON THAT APPERT THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE MILLION IN THE COMPLEX CARE FUNDING EIGHTEEN POINT ONE MILLION OF THOSE FUNDS ARE ONGOING FUNDS TO SUPPORT CHILD BUT THE BIG EMERGENT NEED FAMILY IN CANADA ARE YOU STARTING TO. IDENTIFY SOME OF THOSE NEEDS AN ACCESS FUND FOR THE. SERVICES AND DEVELOPING INTENDED. SERVICES SHOP CARE IN HERE TEN SERVICE THE POPPED CARE. THE QUALITY SURE HAPPENED FROM OUT OF TO. INTO SUPPORT OUR REGIONAL CENTER YOU- IN ADDITION CONTINUING TO TRY TO DO THAT GAP ANALYSIS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL COUNTY BY COUNTY IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE FORTY THREE POINT THREE MILLION IN OFFICE STARTING TO BE SOME OF THE THINGS. THAT MR MURRAY PROJECT TALKING ABOUT- SOME OF THE CAPACITY THAT WE NEED TO BUILD AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO SUPPORT YOU WHAT HAS HAPPENS IF SUPPORTERS PHANTOM OF THE COLOR KERING. VISIBILITY AND THE INTERACTION BETWEEN OUR CHILD WELFARE AND DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES WITH THEM. UNTIL WE ARE SEEING SOME OF THAT AT THAT POINT IN AND SEEN THAT WE HAVE. WITH YOU KNOW WITH WE ARE THINKS EXACTLY SOME OF THESE VERY INDIVIDUALIZED INTENSIVE. MODELS TO SUPPORT CHILDREN. JUST TO FOLLOW UP MISTER CHAIR ON THIS RE. THAT ARE OF AT ONE OF THIS- SPOKEN I HEARD THAT OUT OF- THE Q. FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ONLY EIGHT COUNTIES HAVE SOME TYPE OF A- SHELTER. FACILITY FOR THOSE THAT ARE OUT THERE. SOME WONDERING- HOW TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THIS TOPIC AND WE COULD ALSO HAVE A FOLLOW UP MEETING ON A WRONG TO DIVE INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT- IF. EIGHT COUNTIES HAVE SOME TYPE OF A SHELTER I BELIEVE IT WAS A SHELTER FACILITY- FOR- YOU THIRD OF THOSE THAT ARE. IN THIS TYPE OF A SITUATION- THEN WHO WE WOULD SEE THAT THERE IS A DRASTIC NEED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR THESE TYPES OF IMPLEMENTATIONS- AND THEN WHEN WE HAVE A FOLLOW UP. DISCUSSION MISTER CHAIR THROUGH THE CHAIR WE COULD TALK ABOUT THE- PROGRAMS IN THE FACILITY SAAB FOR. HOW LONG PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY GETTING RESOURCES- SPECIFICALLY- THE STAYS AS IT TWENTY FOUR HOURS- I KNOW WE HEARD THAT ON A- DISCUSSION EARLIER THIS WEEK- IN THIS COMMITTEE. BUT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE DEEPER IMPACTS OF THOSE IN THE RESOURCES ARE THERE AND MAKING SURE THAT IT'S- THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS BEING- IDENTIFIED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR THOSE THAT WHEN THEY NEED THE RESOURCES. THEY HAVE PLACES TO GO AND THAT THERE'S SOME. AREAS THAT WE GET ON THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. ASSEMBLY MEMBER REMINISCED AND MAYBE I'LL I'LL KICK THIS OFF IN A DEPUTY DIRECTOR SHORTS OR OTHERS WANT TO ADD. THAT AS WELL- I DO WANT TO FIRST VERIFY THAT THERE ARE. SLIGHTLY MORE THAN EIGHT COUNTIES THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF SHELTERS BOTH TEMPORARY SHELTERS AND TRANSITIONAL SHELTERS AND THERE ARE EIGHT WHO HAVE. A TEMPORARY PLUS A FEW OTHERS WHO HAVE TRANSITIONAL BUT I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT- THE REMAINING COUNTIES IN MANY INSTANCES HAVE IDENTIFIED OTHER SOLUTIONS SUCH AS- EMERGENCY FAMILY HOME PLACEMENTS- OR PERHAPS IN SOME INSTANCES MIGHT BE UTILIZING. AT S. T. R. TEEPEES IF THEY HAVE CHILDREN WHO HAVE A HIGH LEVEL LOOK NEEDED FOR WHOM THEY NEED TO. DO AN ASSESSMENT AND THEN IDENTIFY A PLACEMENT SO IT IS- NOT NECESSARILY AT THE CASE IN ALL CASES BUT I'M NOT HAVING A SHELTER MEANS- THAT THOSE COUNTIES THAT DON'T HAVE A SOLUTION FOR WHAT TO DO WHEN A CHILD FIRST COMES INTO CARE. OR WHEN THERE IS A CHILD WITH COMPLEX NEEDS WHO IS. IN NEED OF REPLACEMENT CHANGE. THANK YOU MISTER FOR BUT- EVEN AT THAT WITH FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY ARE STILL A DRASTIC NEED FOR THE RESOURCES TO BE READILY AVAILABLE FOR THOSE THAT NEED. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER RUBIO. THANK YOU ON THIS QUESTION- MISS WORKS AND IS- TROY I BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE NOT ENTERED THE FOURTH BULLET. I ON THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE SUBMITTED. TO M. PERHAPS I WHICH PAGE YOU'RE ON OR WHAT. YES PAID SEVENTEEN UNDER YOUR- THE FOURTH BULLET ON PAGE SEVENTEEN UNDER YOUR BOTH OF YOUR NAMES. REGARD TO THE EIGHTY FIVE MILLION THAT'S CORRECT. WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL- WITH REGARD TO THE EIGHTY FIVE MILLION AND- CONTINUE TO- CONTEND THAT THE ARCADE PROGRAM WAS REALIGNED- WHAT PART OF THEIR REALIGNMENT TO THE COUNTIES IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN BUT ALSO DEFERRED TO MY COLLEAGUE THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WELL NOT TYPICALLY SAYS WHAT WOULD BE THE IMPACT OF NOT CONTINUING THE EIGHTY FIVE MILLION INVESTMENT. SO JUST RAISED BERMAN FINANCE A I THINK THAT I'LL NEED TO DIFFERENT APARTMENT IF THEY WANT TO SCHEDULE WHAT THOSE RESOURCES MAY HAVE BEEN USED FOR IN THE PAST BUT I THINK THE SIMPLE RESPONSES THE IMPACT IS THAT THERE JUST ISN'T A PROPOSAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATION TO AUGMENTS- ACTIVITIES TAT ARE FUNDED THROUGH THE TWO THOUSAND AND REALIGNMENTS. A SPECIFICALLY THE RFA PROGRAM- BUT BEYOND THAT WHAT COUNTIES MAY HAVE USED THOSE RESOURCES FOR- I NEED TO DEFER TO THAT DEPARTMENT ON HOW THE FUNDING WAS SET UP. FOR REIMBURSEMENTS OR CLAIMING AND SO ON. THANK YOU. YES HELLO SO DO YOU HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT. THE COUNTY HAVE REPORTED THAT THE EIGHTY FIVE MILLION WHICH USED PRIMARILY FOR THAT REPORT ASSEMBLY APPROVE ALL. YEAH IF I MIGHT THIS IS KATHY THUNDERING THROUGH THE PDA ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO- AS A CONNECTION AND- WE HAVE WHAT'S CALLED A TRUE UP PROCESS THAT WE'VE UNDERTAKEN WITH. OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND CFS INVOLVEMENT TO LOOK AT ALL ASPECTS OF THE CONTINUE OF CARE REFORM REMEMBER THAT OUR PROPOSITION THIRTY ESSENTIALLY SEVENTH THAT IN A REAL LINE PROGRAM WHICH CHILD WELFARE IS PART OF THE TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT. OF IF THERE IS A NEW REQUIREMENT THAT'S AN ACTIVE IN STATE LAW FOLLOWING THE ENACTMENT OF PROP THIRTY AT TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT THAT OFTEN LEFT THAT IS FUNDED COUNTIES ARE ESSENTIALLY THE REMEDY IS COUNTIES DON'T HAVE TO DO IT- WHICH IS NOT A GREAT REMEDY IN THIS CASE BECAUSE THERE IS- UNFORTUNATE THERE'S NO NOTHING TO FALL BACK ON ME THE ONLY WAY. THAT WE CAN IMPROVE OUR HOME IS TO USE THE RFA PROCESS THE OLD STRUCTURE WAS STRIPPED OUT OF THE LAW AS PART OF THAT COULD YOU TO CARE REFORM SO THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE THE TRUTH PROCESS AND THAT SPENDING THAT IS SPECIFIC TO AREN'T THEY ACTIVITIES. IS COUNTED AS PART OF THAT AND THAT'S WHY WE KNOW THAT COUNTIES ARE SPENDING A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OVER AND ABOVE WHAT WAS INCLUDED IN TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT WHICH AT THE TIME WAS JUST A FEW COUNTIES PARTICIPATING IN A PILOT IT WASN'T A MANDATE IT WASN'T STATEWIDE WITH THE PILOT. AND SO A FEW COUNTIES HAD SOME MONEY INCLUDED BUT IT WASN'T FULL SCALE IN THOSE COUNTIES AND IT CERTAINLY WASN'T FIFTY EIGHT AND SO- THIS IS AN AREA OF AS YOU CAN TELL ALL ONGOING DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN. US IN A PDA- VENTURE TO SAY COUNTIES IN GENERAL ON THIS POINT- AS WELL AT AND THE ADMINISTRATION- BUT GIVEN THAT- IT WAS NOT A STATEWIDE MANDATE UNTIL THE T. C. R. LEGISLATION WHICH IS WELL AFTER. TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT ON WE FEEL STRONGLY THAT A WE KNOW HOW MY IT IS. WE KNOW THAT IT'S MY THAN A ONE. AND WE FEEL THAT IT'S BE FUNDED. UNDER PROP. IT DIDN'T GET. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY CLARIFY THAT. THANKS FOR THE CLARIFICATION I APPRECIATED AND I HAVE JUST FOR FUTURE I'M I KNOW THAT- WE GET- THESE THE AGENDAS PRIOR TO ALONG WITH THE QUESTION SO IF YOU KNOW OF. WE COME HERE WITH THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THOSE QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED IT NOT SKIPPED OVER SO I'D APPRECIATE IT THAT FROM NOW ON THAT- ALL OF THE QUESTIONS THERE ARE ON THE AGENDA WILL BE ANSWERED. THANK YOU WITH THAT I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE CHAIR TO BEGIN A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS I'M I'M GONNA PICK UP WITH WHERE THE CONVERSATION IS AND FOLLOW UP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE IT REALLY IS ABOUT THE TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN REALIGNMENT. THAT I'D LIKE TO FIGURE OUT IF YOU CAN PLEASE COMPARE THE COSTS OF R. F. A. AND THE EXTENT OF ITS IMPLEMENTATION. AT THE TIME OF TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT. AND THEN THE COST AND EXTENT OF IMPLEMENTATION. I AM HOPING THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CAN PLEASE WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. TO PROVIDE AT THIS COMPARISON IN WRITING TO US SO THAT WE CAN WORK TOWARDS THAT TRUE UP WHICH WAS MENTIONED. MORE TO FOLLOW AFTER MY- QUESTIONS ON THIS PANEL BUT WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS ABLE TO. RETURN IN WRITING THAT INFORMATION TO US. AGAIN JUST PRESCRIBE FINANCE THE- I THINK MAYBE FIRST WE CAN PROVIDE A FEW CLARIFYING COMMENTS ON.ON THIS IS THE- AND THE REAL ON THE RESOURCE AND THE APPROVAL AND REALIGNMENT AND HOW FUNDING. V. MAYBE LOOK BACK ON A REAL QUICKLY ON THE PROCESS IS NOT NECESSARILY A NEW PROCESS REQUIRED ACCOUNTING WHAT THE- A RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS WITH THIS BECOMING A UNIFIED PROCESS. FOR APPROVING A FOSTER HOME OR FOSTER FAMILY THERE USED TO BE THREE PROCESSES ONE FOR LICENSING FOSTER FAMILY HOMES ONE FOR APPROVING RELATIVE NON RELATIVE EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS AS FOSTER PROVIDERS. AND ANOTHER FOR PROVING A DOCTOR FOUND IS. THE RESOURCE MAINLY APPROVAL I WAS INCLUDED IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN REALIGNMENTS AS A UNIFIED PROCESS IT ORIGINALLY IT STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AS PILOT PROGRAMS BUT IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. REALIGNMENT IS INCLUDED AS A PARTICIPATING COUNTIES WITH AN EXPECTATION THAT IT WOULD BE. IMPLEMENTED STATEWIDE BY COUNTIES BY TWENTY FOURTEEN I BELIEVE IT'S WHAT IT WHAT SO. FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM. HAS BEEN INCLUDED- THROUGH REALIGNMENTS AGAIN THE IDEA WAS TO STREAMLINE IT SO WHEN HAVE A DUPLICATED PROCESS OF THOSE OTHER PROCESSES FOR DO YOU RENOUNCE. ARMED WITH REGARDS TO THE REQUEST FOR A COMPARISON OF FUNDING- WELL WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON ISSUES SUCH AS THIS AND SOME OF THE OTHER COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS LISTED IN THE AGENDA. HOWEVER WE WOULD. IN THE MEAN REVISION AND WE MAY NOT HAVE CAPACITY DURING THIS TIME TO ENGAGE IN THESE DISCUSSIONS. ARE ONCE THE MAY REVISION IS RELEASED- THE ADMINISTRATION WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON ANY LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISION. THANK LET ME THEN JUST START THIS HAS BEEN A MULTI YEAR PROCESS AND THIS IS BEEN AN AREA OF CONTENTION BETWEEN THE STATE AND COUNTIES. AND AS THIS APPEARS TO BE WHAT WAS A PILOT AND- PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION BY TWENTY ELEVEN WITH THE EXPECTATION OF COMPLETION. BY TWENTY FOURTEEN WE HEARD TODAY THAT OUR PHASE NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE STATE. THAT I'D LIKE TO REALLY. INSIST THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HELPS US TO UNDERSTAND- THIS RE ALIGNMENT AS I BELIEVE IT WILL ALLOW U TO MAKE SURE WERE APPROPRIATELY RESOURCING AND- UP PROVIDING FOR A RESOURCE FAMILIES- I WOULD I WOULD SIMPLY POINT. TOWARDS THE LEGISLATORS INSISTENCE ON THIS FUNDING OVER THE PAST NUMBER OF YEARS AS A SIGN OF OUR WILLINGNESS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS FUNDING FOR US. AND BELIEVE THAT WOULD IT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO TRUE UP THIS GOING FORWARD. I'D LIKE TO- I WILL FOLLOW UP WITH SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS AGAIN AFTER QUESTIONS I WILL NOW MOVE ON TO MISFORTUNE MYSTERY IF I CAN. LIKE TOUGH- FOCUS ON FAMILY FINDING- CURRENTLY WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL THERE ARE THERE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THIS PROPOSAL WHEN WE- FEDERALLY MATCH THAT THAT TURNS INTO ONE POINT FIVE MILLION. WHAT EFFECTS ARE REALLY EXPECTED FROM THIS PROPOSAL FOR FAMILY FINDING HOW DOES THIS INVESTMENT COMPARE AND CONTRAST WITH WHAT THE STATE HAS DONE IN PRIOR BUDGETS- WITH PEPPERS AS AN EXAMPLE. TO HELP PROVIDE A SCOPE OF HOW THIS FUNDING IS IN COMPARISON TO OTHER FUNDING WE'VE DONE IN THE SYSTEM. DEPUTY DIRECTOR SHORT- THAT. THE PURPOSE OF THE FUNDING IS REALLY TO WORK WITH THAT. YEAH BALLAGE OUR CONTRACT FOR TRAINING COACHING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COUNTIES TO DEVELOP SORT OF AN INTENSIVE FAMILY ENGAGEMENT EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE ABOUT THE TRAUMA INFORMED TO TURN UP AND BAT WITH THE END. THEIR PRACTICE MODEL BUT IT'S REALLY ABOUT TRAINING AND COACHING- IN ORDER TO ENABLE THE COUNTY BOARD OF REFINED THEIR FAMILY ENGAGEMENT APPROACHES I SPOKE EARLIER ABOUT SOME OF THE STRATEGIES. OF THE BEAM I'M HAVE SIX BATHROOMS SO IT WOULD. BE AN VETTING FROM OTHERS. STRATEGY AROUND BETULA PERMAN IN FAMILIES THAT THE RECRUIT AND FATHERING. KAYPRO IT A WAY THAT ALLOWS COUNTY TO- TAKE THAT TRAINING AND THE COACHING THE TECHNICAL EXPENSE TO REFINE THEIR MODELS. IT'S REALLY A DIFFERENT PURPOSE AND THE FUNDS THAT MISS TENDERLY MCDONALD OKAY EARLIER BETTER ADEQUATE OR IF IT'S AFFECTED THAT. DOLLARS WHICH WAS OR YOU KNOW THE ACTUAL WITH WHICH WHICH WAS INTENDED AT THE START OF THE FIFTY YARD TO ALLOW COUNTIES IF YOU. HAVE SOME OF THOSE FUNDS FOR- REALLY FAMILY SPECIFIC RECRUITMENT LIKE I LIKE I SAID YOU KNOW WE DO HAPPEN INVESTMENT IN SUPPORT FOR COUNTIES. THAT THEY CAN HAPPEN TO YOU FOR THAT FAMILY BASED RECRUITMENT PLUS THAT FUNDING IS INTENDED TO IMPACT THIRD ABOUT PRACTICE MODEL WITHIN THE COUNTIES IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT MARK EXCEPTIONALLY. AND WE'VE ALSO HAD OTHER SUPPORT FOR THE ONE THAT HAD SLOWEDTO THE COUNTIES- IN THE INTERVENING YEARS MAKE SURE THAT OUR PRINTER ROUGHLY PROVIDING SUPPORT CONSERVE IT TENDS TO YOU IN THE FAMILY PLANNING LIKE THE ACRYLIC CARE GET BURKE. PROGRAM IN THE EMERGENCY CHARACTER PROGRAM THIRD OF FUNDS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY SUPPORT THAT RELATIVE OR FINDING AND ROBUSTLY SUPPORT THEM SO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF **** OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS THAT HAVE. ENABLED COUNTIES TO WORK FULLY NOT JUST FINE I GREW UP IN A FINGERLING MCCONNELL THE FINDING IS NOT ENOUGH WE ALSOHAVE TO REALLY ENGAGE IN THE COURT THAT LATE FROM THERE HAVE BEEN ONGOING INVESTMENT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ABLE TO DO THAT ENGAGEMENT. AND SUPPORT. WHAT I'M GONNA UP ON WHAT SO. MCDONALD SET UP FIFTH AND THE- NEED FOR A TO READ. THE IT'S NOT ONE AND DONE. THAT I WOULD TO UNDER. AGAIN FROM THE ADMINISTRATION HOW MIGHT A REINVESTMENT INTO FIBERS. ASSIST WITH THE EFFORTS ALREADY UNDERWAY REGARDING LOCATING AND SUPPORTING FAMILY BASED CARE. EITHER FOR JAN TROYER OR MISH WART. CAN YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION HOW THE HOW THE FIFTY DOLLARS FROM I'M SORRY JUST I THINK I MESSED OKAY THAT'S A BIG QUESTION I'M PENALIZED ON. REINVESTMENT WHAT AFFECT WE BELIEVE THAT FOR PERSONAL ORDERS WOULD HAVE AND WOULD ASSIST US WITH OUR EFFORTS WHICH ARE ALREADY UNDER WAY REGARDING LOCATING AND SUPPORTING FAMILY BASED CARE. ARE WE ONE AND DONE OR DOES THIS NEED TO CONTINUE REPLENISHING. YEAH WE SHAPE THE QUESTION AND WE SEE THAT THAT'S THE FIRST FUNDING IF THE BEGINNING OF CC ARE IN AN EFFORT TO SEE PRACTICES THAT THE COUNTIES THAT WE ASSUMED THAT THEY WOULD THEN HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE UNDER REALIGNMENT- AND OUR PROPOSAL THIS YEAR REALLY RELATES TO THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING AND SUPPORT THAT'S PROVIDED THROUGH THE FUNDING THAT THE CHAIR. REFERENCED EARLIER- I DO AND I UNDERSTAND THAT- THE COUNTIES HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY BELIEVE THERE WOULD BE VALUE TO CONTINUE AND NOT FUNDING IT'S JUST NOT CURRENTLY- SOMETHING THAT WE'VE WAS THERE ARE ARCHITECT WITH WATSON. I ANTICIPATE HEARING MORE FROM MY OFFICE ON THIS FRONT I WILL NOW MOVE ON TO- CANS IF I CAN- CHILD ADOLESCENTS NEED SURVEY THAT WAS REFERENCES REFERENCED EARLIER. WHAT ARE CONCRETE GOALS FOR CONSISTENT AND UNIFORM REPORTING COMING FROM THE CAMPUS DATA. WHEN WILL WE FINALLY BE ABLE TO ASSESS TO MUCH OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS AND TRENDS. FROM CANS DATA AN AGGREGATED STATE LEVEL. WE HAVE ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES DO YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE PWF CARE IT'S LIVE CAMS COOL BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THEY AREN'T ALL USING THAT TOOL IN ORDER TO COLLECT THEIR KING AND- PAID AND ARE DIFFERENT REASONS FOR THAT. SOME COUNTY IT'S THEIR LOCAL AGREEMENTS WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE TO YOUR POINT A TEAR ARAMBULA THEY NEED HAVE A DIFFERENT. AGENCY LEADING AND LEADING IN COMPLETION OF THE CAMPAIGN ON THAT DATE IT GETS ENTERED INTO THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ELECTRONIC RECORD AND NOT NECESSARILY AND HEAT THAT KERRY FLIGHT CAMP TOOL AND THAT MNY OF THE CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES ARE UTILIZING- AND WE ALSO HAVE COUNTIES THAT ARE USE. THAT ARE CONTRACTING WITH PROVIDERS IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THE KANSEN THOSE PROVIDERS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT CARE LIGHT CAN'T TRAVEL SO WE ARE WORKING TO DEVELOP A SOLUTION- INTERN IN. IN ORDER TO ENABLE US TO- CAPTURE ALL. OF THE COUNTY THAT- THE THAT WE CAN START MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE A MORE COMPLETE PICTURE OF THE GOING ON WITH PEOPLE. THAT ALL. HAVE IMPLEMENTED CAN'T ARE UTILIZING THE CANS THAT YOU DON'T SEE IT CONSISTENTLY IN THE DATA THAT WE ARE COLLECTING ART- WHAT ACCESS THEM IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THAT TRENDS. THAT YOU HAVE AND I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THAT WE NEED TO DEVELOP THAT SOLUTION AND ARE ACTIVELY WORKING TO DO THAT. I WOULD ADD ANOTHER LAYER WHICH IS I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE THE DATA- BOTH CONSISTENT AND UNIFORM FOR CANS. BUT HOW CAN WE AS THE DEPARTMENT AND STATE ENSURE THAT WE ARE MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS THAT COME FROM THE FF'S PSA. BURKE CONGREGATE CARE PLACEMENTS SPECIFICALLY THAT A FULL CANS ASSESSMENT INCLUDING THE TRAUMA MODULE IS COMPLETED AS PART OF THE QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS. ASSESSMENT WHICH IS REQUIRED WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. OF AN S. T. R. T. P. PLACEMENT IF WE ARE NOT REQUIRING. THAT THEY USE CANS AND SUBMIT THAT INFORMATION FROM US HOW ARE WE GONNA VERIFIED TO. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO WHAT'S REQUIRED IN TERMS OF THAT VERIFICATION CODE THAT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THAT THERE WAS AN ATTACHMENT BY THE QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL AND WE ARE. OPTING TO USE THE CANCEL AND NOT ASSESSMENT AND BELIEVE THAT THAT IS BEING DONE IN THE DIFFERENT Q. I ASSESSMENT SOME NOT ALL WE HAVE NOT HEARD THAN ANY OF THE QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT UTILIZING. THAT TOOL AND ALSO BEEN WORKING WITH THAT- CHILD AND FAMILY TEAM IN ORDER TO GET. THE COMPLETE INFORMATION THAT IS NECESSARY IN MAKING THOSE DETERMINATIONS AND THEN ALSO WE NEED TO REPORT BACK. TIME TO THAT BAD ON THAT THAT ASSESSMENT THAT COMPLETED BY OUR QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS TO THAT COURT AND THE COURT NEEDS TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION- ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY AGREED BUT THE QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS THAT HAPPEN AND EITHER APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE OF THE PLACEMENT SAID THAT. ELEMENTS THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT TO THE- FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SPECIFIC TO THE QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT BEING DONE ON THE COURT APPROVING THE CREEPING AT. BEST PLACEMENT- WE ARE ABLE TO CAP. THAT THAT WORK IS BEING. AND IT BEING GOOD BE USED CAN'T THERE IS- SIGNIFICANT VARIATION THAT OCCURS AMONG THE COUNTIES THAT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS STATE IS REACTING TO THAT. VARIATION I AM TRULY APPRECIATE THE GOALS OF C. C. R. REFORM AND FOR MANY OF US WE WOULD. LIKE TO ALREADY BE THERE BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE COUNTIES THAT SEEM TO BE. DRAGGING THEIR FEET AND- ARE NOT IMPLEMENTING MUCH OF THE CHANGES THAT WE ARE WORKING ON HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL- WHAT'S THE STATE'S REACTION TO THAT. TWO PART FOUR WE HAVE BEEN OFFERING- I'M GOING IN ROBUST TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT TO COUNTIES IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE. SERVICES PARTNER IN ORDER TO PROVIDE VERY INTENSIVE TRAINING WITH REGARD TO THE QUEUE I REQUIREMENTS FORGET HOW THAT ASSESSMENT. NEEDS TO OCCUR AND THEN WORK WITH THAT CHILD AND FAMILY TEAM I'M IN THE SUBMISSION OF THE INFORMATION THAT'S REQUIRED TO THE COURT SO WE'VE HAD ONGOING TRAINING- TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CALLS THAT ARE OFFERED ON IT TWICE A MONTH BASIS AND POSTING ALL OF THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS. ON OUR WEBSITE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT COUNTIES HAVE THE MOST UP TO DATE INFORMATION POSSIBLE AND SUPPORT WE ALSO DO INDIVIDUAL TA CALLED- AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS THE COUNTIES IN OUR- HEALTHCARE PARTNERS ARE PROBATION PARTNERS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- PARTNERS IN ORDER TO MEET. REGULARLY- AND- IT ADDED TERM WHAT ASPECTS OF FAMILY FIRST ARTICLE VERY THAT LEVEL AND ADDRESS THOSE. BUT WE DO HAVE THIRD OF MORE. MATH BY WHICH GATHERED. INFORMATION AND GETTING INFORMATION BACK TO THE FEEL OF AN IMPROVING AND ENHANCING OUR TRAINING- I WILL ASK THREE FINAL QUESTIONS MY NEXT QUESTION IS FROM THE SANDERLING MCDONALD- WE HEARD ABOUT THE SS I APPEALS PROCESS AND- I'M HOPING YOU CAN COMMENT ON WHETHER OR NOT THOSE SAME SOCIAL WORKERS CAN. MAKE SIMILAR INQUIRIES FOR OTHER STATE SAFETY NET PROGRAM SUCH AS CALFRESH FOR MEDIC CAL- AND IF SO WITHOUT REQUIRING QUICK INCREASED RESOURCE IN JUST WANT TO GET YOUR OPINION ON THAT. THAT'S A REALLY GREAT QUESTION- SHERRIN I- I MEAN EMPIRICALLY YES OF COURSE THEY COULD DO THAT WORK I WOULD SAY. FOLLOWING UP TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA- COUPLE THOUGHTS ON THAT IS THAT- AS WE THINK ABOUT YOUTH TRANSITIONING INTO EXTENDED FOSTER CARE WE KNOW THAT THEY DO CONTINUE TO HAVE SOCIAL WORK SUPPORT. AND SO SOME OF THAT MAY BE DONE IN THAT WAY ALREADY BUT I WOULD SAY WE KNOW THAT THE INDEPENDENT LIVING PROGRAMS THAT EXIST IN ALL IN ALL COUNTIES BUT VERY GREATLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE VERY DIFFERENT RESOURCES. AT THEIR DISPOSAL BOTH THE FUNDING BUT ALSO WHAT KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS COMPANIES ARE LOCATED IN THOSE COUNTIES YOU MAY HAVE A LARGE FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANY AND A LARGER COUNTY THAT CAN DONATE- COMPUTERS OR DONATE- GIFT CARDS. INTENDED TO USE AND DO SO AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND THE SMALLER COUNTY YOU JUST MAY NOT HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND SO- WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER TIME IS. A GREAT DIFFERENCE IN BOTH THE RESOURCES BUT ALSO THE TYPES OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT YOU GET FROM THESE PROGRAMS DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY LIVE. AND SO PART OF THE CONVERSATION AND ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED I THINK IS TO LOOK AT THAT PROGRAM WHICH WERE SUGGESTING REALLY NEEDS TO BE DONE AT THIS POINT- THE FAMILY FIRST- PREVENTION SERVICES ACT HAS A PROVISION AND THAT THAT MAKES SOME CHANGES. TO THE IOP PROGRAM WHICH HAS SOME FEDERAL FUNDING AND WE THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE MODEL AND SEE WHAT WE COULD DO TO BETTER SUPPORT YOUTH AS THEY'RE TRANSITIONING- THAT THE FACT THAT WERE PARTNERING WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER FULLY ON. IN ADDITION TO LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN GET A MORE HOUSING RESOURCES. TO ARGUE WITH THE TRANSITIONAL HOW. IS SO A I COULD PIECE WE KNOW. AND HAVE THIS AND COMMITTEE- IN THE PAST HOW ARE YOU REALLY STRUGGLE TO STAY HOW IS THEY THEY HAVE A LOT OF HOUSING AND SECURITY AND SO I THINK ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS TO MERE OTHER PIECE. AND THAT THERE ARE SOME WAYS THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO THINK ABOUT ALL THE BEST WAY TO SUPPORT OUR YOUTH AND WORK WITH THEM AS THEY ARE MOVING. IDEALLY TOWARD EXTENDED FOSTER CARE UP TO AGE TWENTY ONE BUT SOME TO DROP OFF AT AGE EIGHTEEN THEY DON'T UNDER EXTENDED FOSTER CARE AND THEN AGAIN AT AGE TWENTY ONE. EXTENDED FOSTER CARE AND SO WITH A COUPLE DIFFERENT POINTS IN TIME WHERE BENEFITS I ADVOCACY PROBABLY YOU KNOW KIND OF CAN DOVETAIL WITH SOME OF THESE OTHER EFFORTS AS LONG AND HAPPY TO CONTINUE ENGAGING WITH YOU. AND OF COURSE THE ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ON. THE YOU I LOOK FORWARD THOSE CON. I'D LIKE TO NOW TURN THE PAGE TWENTY TWO WITHIN THE AGENDA- I WILL BEGIN WITH THE LEVEL OF CARE PROTOCOL TOOL. I I'D LIKE TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION THIS IS REFERENCED IN THE AGENDA. WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS THINKING ABOUT SOMEHOW COMBINING THE LEVEL OF CARE TOOL. WITH THE CANS SO THAT THERE COULD BE MORE COHESION IN TRACKING. AND DATA REPORTING HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT. WE ARE CONTINUING TO ASSESS THE LEVEL OF CARE PROTOCOL AND CONTINUING TO EVALUATE WHETHER OTHER TOOLS LIKE BASECAMP COULD SUPPORT THAT LEVEL OF CARE DETERMINATION AND WE HAVE HAD. THE LEVEL OF CARE IMPLEMENTED DEFENSE APRIL FIRST OF LAST YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE- AND IT IS OCCURRING NOW AND ALL OF OUR NEW PLACEMENTS OR ANYTIME THERE'S A PLACEMENT CHANGE AND WE HAVE BEEN SEEING AN UPTICK. IN THE NUMBER OF YEARS THAT ARE AT STAFF- INTO LEVELS TWO THREE AND FOUR AS WELL AS IN CAT THE I. S. AT THE LEVEL BUT CONTINUING TO ENGAGE IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT- WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN TOOL COULD OPT. AT THE PORT THAT DETERMINATION. FOLLOWING ON THAT SO PAGE PAGE TWENTY TWO AT THE BOTTOM. REGARDING S. T. R. T. P. TRANSITIONS- FROM THE DATA THAT WE HAVE WE CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE UNLICENSED FACILITIES. WHAT ARE THE PATTERNS WERE SEEING RELATED TO THIS ACROSS THE STATE AND- IS THERE A MAP PERHAPS FOR US TO LOOK AT. ARE THE COUNTY'S EQUIPPED TO IDENTIFY AND SUPPORT THE FACILITIES THAT HAVEN'T YET. RECEIVED THESE MENTAL HEALTH APPROVALS AND- I I'D LIKE TO JUST POINTS TO THE COUNTY STRIKE TEAMS THAT- HELPS TO INTERVENE AND SUPPORT SUCCESSFUL TRANSITIONS EARLY ON IN THE PANDEMIC AS AN EXAMPLE AND- WONDERING IF THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOTICED A PATTERN. WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK- PROVIDERS ARE GIVEN TIME TO OBTAIN THEIR MENTAL HEALTH APPROVAL PROGRAM UP TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS- BUT WE KNOW THAT PROVIDERS MAY NOT HAVE CONFIRMED THAT BILL ABILITY OF ENTERING INTO A CONTRACT FOR THAT SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WHAT THE HECK COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLAN- AND COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS MAY NOT HAVE A CURRENT REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OPENER. NINETEEN CONTRACT WITH A PROVIDER WHICH WOULD PREVENT THAT PROVIDER FROM IT. TEAM COMPARED MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM APPROVAL- THE PREDATORS YOU COULD STILL CONTACT WITH OTHER COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS BUT EACH INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT TAKES TIME TO EXECUTE. YEAH WE ARE CONTINUING TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- AND SUPPORT TO PROVIDERS INVOLVING- THEIR UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM TO IN THE TIMELY APPROVAL. JUST TO CLARIFY THAT THE COMPUTER ITSELF OUR LIFE AND SPENDING BUT THEY ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO GET THE FINAL HEALTH. PLAN APPROVAL AND SO IT THAT- THAT THE NUMBER THAT YOU CITED AS THE NUMBER OF OUR ACTIVITIES THAT DON'T YET HAVE. THEIR MENTAL HEALTH PLAN APPROVAL. WE WILL FOLLOW WITH THE I. WOULD WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE HAD ON THIS PANEL. I WOULD NOW LIKE TO KINDLY ASK THAT WE HAVE A MEETING CONVENES WITH THE LEGISLATIVE STAFF. LMAO THE ADMINISTRATION SPECIFICALLY THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN COORDINATION WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS. ASSOCIATION SO THAT WE CAN WALK THROUGH THE REQUEST THAT ARE BEING MADE WITHIN THE C. W.D. A PROPOSAL LIST. OF C. C. R. INVESTMENT PACKAGES. THE PURPOSE OF THE MEETING WOULD BE PRINCIPALLY FIRST TO CLARIFY WHETHER EACH INDIVIDUAL PROPOSAL IS WORKLOAD BUDGET RELATED. I II IT'S A PROPOSAL THAT ARGUABLY PERMITS A COUNTY TO COMPLY WITH THE CURRENT STATE REQUIREMENTS AND THAT IDENTIFIES A GAP IN RESOURCES BETWEEN WHAT IS PROVIDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND WHAT IS REQUIRED BY COUNTIES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACTIVITIES PURSER PURSUANT TO CURRENT LAW. OR IF THE PROPOSAL IS GENUINELY A NEW POLICY DISCUSSION THAT'S NOT CURRENTLY NEEDED BY CURRENT LAW. AND THAT SECOND. EXAMINES A COMPARISON OF THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS AND COSTS OF RFA AT THE TOP OF THE TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT AND WHAT ARE A FAKE COSTS ARE NOW. PURSUANT TO THE TRUE UP METHODOLOGY ENACTED SINCE REALIGNMENT. I'D LIKE TO REQUEST THE ASSISTANCE OF THE L. A. O. AND WE'RE GONNA AND FACILITATE. MEETING WORKING WITH THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND MY STAFF. I'D LIKE TO BE PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN THIS CONVERSATION. AT THIS MEETING AND I PLAN TO REACH OUT TO MY COLLEAGUES IN THE- AND BY THEM AS WELL. I REQUEST THAT MEETING TAKE PLACE AS SOON AS PRACTICAL PRACTICAL GOAL FOR ALL PARTIES BUT NO LATER THAN APRIL FIFTH PLEASE. IS THE ADMINISTRATION AMENABLE TO THIS REQUEST. BEST NUMBER IS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I GET EVERYDAY WE CANNOT COMMIT TO HAVING THESE DISCUSSIONS PRIOR TO RELEASE THE MAY REVISION BUT WE LOOK FOR PROVIDING ASSISTANCE WHERE WE CAN AND WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF TO DETERMINE HOW WE'RE ABLE TO BETTER ASSIST. I LOOK FORWARD AND HOPE THAT WE WILL STOP KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD AND BE ABLE TO ANSWER MANY OF THE- TOUGH QUESTIONS THAT ARE FACING US SO THAT WE CAN. APPROPRIATELY HAVE THE DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY HERE IN THE SUB COMMITTEE. AND WOULD ENCOURAGE THE ADMINISTRATION TO SIT DOWN WITH THE WTA AND THE LEGISLATURE AND STAFF. TO HELP TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES GOING FORWARD. WITH THAT I WILL THANK ALL OF THE PANEL FOR ISSUE TO AND WE WILL NOW MOVE ON. TO ISSUE THREE. WHERE WE WILL HAVE SIX TOTAL PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL FOR ISSUE THREE-I BELIEVE THAT JESSICA HOSPITAL THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF CHILD WELFARE WITH CHILDREN NOW NEEDS TO GO FIRST. IN THIS PANEL AND WOULD LIKE TO CREATE THAT SPACE- SO IF WE CAN PLEASE BEGIN WITH MISS HASPEL FOLLOWED BY- ENTRY SUPPORT. THANK YOU CHAIR IN SUB COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS FAMILY FIRST PART ONE IMPLEMENTATION TODAY. I'M JUST GONNA HASPEL ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF CHILD WELFARE POLICY BUT CHILDREN AND- CHILDREN'S RESEARCH POLICY AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION. FOCUSED ON BUILDING POWER FOR KIDS ZERO TO TWENTY SIX CROSS EDUCATION HOW IN CHILD WELFARE. IN RESPONSE TO YOUR GENDER QUESTIONS I PLAN TO HIGHLIGHT FOR CHALLENGES THAT ARE. OCCURRING ONE- IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING AS WELL AS SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STEPS THE STATE CAN TAKE TO HELP ENSURE FAMILIES RECEIVE CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE PREVENTION SERVICES. I THE FIRST CHALLENGE I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS JUST THE NEED FOR CLEAR AND DETAILED GUIDANCE ON IMPLEMENTING PART ONE WITHIN THAT CONTEXT OF CALIFORNIA'S BROADER PREVENTION ASIAN IN THE ALLOWABLE USES OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE BLOCK GRANT FUNDING- ONCE RELEASED WE HOPE. THAT THE UPCOMING CDSS ALL COUNTY LETTER THAT'S FOCUSED ON THE STATE PARK RAMP FUNDING AND THE OPT IN PROCESS. I WILL PROVIDE COUNTIES WITH THE INITIAL GUIDANCE THEY NEED TO BEGIN MOVING FORWARD. WE WILL HOWEVER EXPECT THAT THERE BE AN ANGLE WE NEED FOR. GUIDANCE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS WELL AS A CLEAR PROCESS FOR ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING ADVOCATES IN THOSE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE. IN DEVELOPING ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE TOOL KITS AND AMENDMENTS TO THE STATE'S FIVE YEAR PREVENTION PLAN. IMITATIONS OF WHAT SERVICES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL NINETEEN UNDER PART ONE REPRESENT A SECOND IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGE. MOREOVER CALIFORNIA'S INITIAL FIVE YEAR STATE PREVENTION PLAN THAT WAS SUBMITTED FOR FEDERAL APPROVAL IN AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FURTHER LIMITS WHAT SERVICES WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL MATCHING IN CALIFORNIA IN THE NEAR TERM. THERE ARE CURRENTLY FORTY ONE PROGRAMS RATED AS PROMISING SUPPORTED OR WELL SUPPORTED BY THE FEDERAL TITLE FOR EACH PREVENTION SERVICES CLEARINGHOUSE IN THEIR ACOSTA I WOULD YOU PULL FOR FEDERAL FUNDING. CALIFORNIA'S ADDITIONAL FIVE YEAR PLAN INCLUDES FIVE PROGRAMS THAT WERE RATED WELL SUPPORTED AT THE TIME OF THE PLANTS MISSION. WE RECOGNIZE THESE PROGRAMS ARE CHOSEN HI AS THE FEDERAL EVALUATION REQUIREMENT CAN BE WAIVED FOR WELL SUPPORTED PROGRAMS AS WELL AS BECAUSE THEY HAVE REVISED OUR MODEL FIDELITY TOOLS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. BUT FURTHER NARROWING THE ARRAY OF SERVICES THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE FOR FEDERAL CLEANING DOES POSE I'M GOING IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES. TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF KEEPING CHILDREN IN YOUTH SAFELY WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND ADDRESS DISPARITIES WE MUST ENSURE THAT FAMILIES ARE PROVIDED WITH THE SERVICES THEY NEED TO MEET THEIR IDENTIFIED NEEDS. EVEN IF NOT ALL SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE FOR FEDERAL I NEED. WE WERE PLEASED TO SEE THE STATE'S TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN PART ONE IN BROADER PREVENTION SERVICES IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. THE STATE BLOCK GRANT FUNDING CAN AND SHOULD BE USED TO BUILD SERVICE GAPS ESPECIALLY GAPS IN CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE SERVICES. HOWEVER THE ONLY FIRST PLANNING IS THAT TIME STILL BEING VIEWED IN A SILENT WAY WITH A FOCUS. ON ON THE SERVICES CONTAINED IN THE PROPOSED STATE PLANS THAT WILL JUST IS A VERY THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT- ON. THE BROADER SERVICE RATE IS BEING CONSIDERED- IT IS PART OF THE FAMILY FIRST IMPLEMENTATION. I CHALLENGES IN MEETING HER CHILD REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO BEGIN FEDERAL CLEANING. ALSO BEEN RAISED IN COULD SUBSTANTIALLY DELAYED FEDERAL CLAIM MAIN IF NOT QUICKLY ADDRESSED. IT'S CRITICAL THAT THE STATE DEVELOPS A SOLUTION. IN COLLABORATION WITH COUNTIES TO ALLOW PER CHILD REPORTING INCLINING TO BEGIN AS SOON AS CALIFORNIA'S FIVE YEAR PREVENTION PLAN IS APPROVED EVEN IF LONGER TERM AUTOMATION AND- IS GOING TO TAKE LONGER TO IMPLEMENT WE NEED TO HAVE SOME SORT OF INTRANSIGENCE AT THAT WE CAN'T GET. MY NAME. BY TAKING THE FOLLOWING THREE STOPS THE STATE CAN HELP ENSURE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES RECEIVE CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE AND TAILORED PREVENTION SERVICES. THE STATE SHOULD PROVIDE ONGOING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND ENCOURAGE COUNTIES TO LEVERAGE THEIR STATE BLOCK GRANT FUNDING TO BEGIN PROVIDING FAMILIES WITH CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE SERVICES. IS UNITS THEIR LETTERS OF INTENT TO OPT IN HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED AND THEIR BLOCK GRANT ALLOCATIONS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED. THE STATE SHOULD MONITOR HOW THIS STATE BLOCK GRANT FUNDING IS BEING USED LOCALLY TO PROVIDE CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE SERVICES. A PORTION OF FUNDING ALLOCATED TO SUPPORT STATE LEVEL ONE EFFORTS SHOULD ALSO BE USED TO EVALUATE AND BUILD THE EVIDENCE FOR CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE SERVICES. TO ENABLE THEIR EVENTUAL INCLUSION IN THE PREVENTION SERVICES VERY HOUSE. THOMASINE SPORTED OR WELL SUPPORTED LEVELS. THIS STATE SHOULD WORK CLOSELY WITH COUNTIES AT COORDINATED STRATEGY FOR BUILDING EVIDENCE. IN THE THIRD STEP IS THAT THE STATE SHOULD IDENTIFY CULTURALLY SPECIFIC SERVICES THAT HAVE MET OR ARE LIKELY TO IT NEEDS THE FEDERAL EVIDENCE BASED STANDARDS ANY RATING LEVEL SO THAT COULD BE PROMISING SUPPORTED OR UNSUPPORTED. FOR INCLUSION IN THE STATE'S FIVE YEAR PREVENTION PLAN WHICH COULD BE AMENDED ANYTIME ONCE IT IS APPROVED. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THESE THOUGHTS ON I'M ALSO HAPPY TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS IN WRITING- IN APPRECIATE I THINK COMBINATIONS FOR LET ME GO FIRST I UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO GET MY DAUGHTER BY. HER PRESCHOOL AT CERTAIN TIMES BOB SO I MAY NOT BE. AVAILABLE TO STAND FOR THE WHOLE PANEL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND- WE'LL NEXT HEAR FROM ANGIE SCHWARTZ THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CDSS. THANK YOU CHAIR ARAMBULA MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THERE CAN I ASK FOR AN UPDATE ON THE STATUS OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO POINT FOUR MILLION BLOCK GRANT. AND IMPLEMENTATION OF PART ONE A FAMILY BURKE PREVENTIONSERVICES BACK. UP ALL OF THE STATUS OF OUR ABILITY TO LEVERAGE THE FUNDS TO ACCESS THE FEDERAL TITLE FORTY NINE. BERMAN HAS RECENTLY FINAL THE BLOCK GRANT ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY AND THE GUIDANCE WILL BE POSTED IN THE COMING WEEK OR TEO- IN ORDER TO ENABLE COUNTY. BEGIN ACCESSING THEIR SHARE AT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO POINT FOUR MILLION BLOCK GRANT. INVESTMENT WILL PROVIDE RESOURCES TO COUNTIES AND- TRIED TO BE AGAIN. BUILDING ADDITIONAL CAPACITY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND TO ASSESS THEIR READINESS TO DELIVER THAT HAVE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT WOULD TARGET. MARGINALITY AND ALLOW US TO DEVELOP THIS CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE SERVICES SUPPORT APPLE WAS JUST. REFERENCING CAN YOU WILL HAVE THE OPTION DEPENDING ON THEIR LEVEL OF READINESS TO BEGIN I'M UTILIZING THESE FUNDS PRIOR TO THE APPROVAL OF OUR- FEDERAL PREVENTION SERVICES PLAN THAT HAVE TO BE APPROVED BEFORE WE CAN START LEVERAGING THAT FEDERAL. IN ORDER FOR COUNTIES TO ACCESS THEIR SHARE OF THE BLOCK GRANT THAT WILL PERMIT A LETTER OF INTENT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. ONE CELEBRATE LETTER OF INTENT TO THREE SPEED- INDICATING THEIR INTENTION TO OPT IN INTO THE FEDERAL- THE FEDERAL FAMILY PARK PREVENTION SERVICES ACT ONCE WE HAVE THAT APPROVAL FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IT WILL BE ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY START ACCESSING THEIR SHARE OF THE BLOCK GRANT ALLOCATION IN ORDER TO BEGIN BUILDING THAT FOUNDATION FOR THE BROADER PREVENTION SERVICES AND SUPPORT- AS WELL. IN THE M. SO THE FOUNDATION FOR THEIR EFFORTS OF DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE PREVENTION PLANS THAT EACH COUNTY WILL HAVE TO SUBMIT. TO THE DEPARTMENT BY JANUARY. OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. WHAT THE GUY IS OUT WE ARE GOING TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN TO WORK WHAT COUNTY IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN THE CIVIC ACTIVITY AGAIN ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT THE- WHAT WHAT JEFF RECOMMENDING. OUR INTENTION IS TO PROVIDE ONGOING TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COUNTY THAT REQUESTED- AS WELL AS WORKING TO START DEVELOPING THE SYSTEM FOR MONITORING THE MODEL ANALOGY OF OUR EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES. AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROCESS THAT WILL BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO ACCESS THAT FEDERAL DOLLARS- COUNTY WILL BE ABLE TO USE THAT PHONE FOR PLANNING CAPACITY BUILDING. IMPLEMENTATION OF READING THAT'S AS WELL AS TO START PROVIDING PRIMARY PREVENTION PRIMARY SECONDARY AND TERTIARY PREVENTION. AND INTERVENTION SERVICES. HE WILL ALSO BE FOR COUNTY AND WORKING WITH THEIR CROPS SECTOR. THEIR LOCAL SERVICE PER. THERE AND THOSE OF THE DIXIE. TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES TO REDUCE DISPROPORTIONATE ALITY AND PARITY I'M CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THEY WILL DO THAT PUT INTO THEIR COMPREHENSIVE PREVENTION SERVICES. PLAN- THE AUTOMATION IS READY WE WILL BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY START CLAIMING THAT FEDERAL TITLE FOR EACH FUNDS TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE PREVENTION EFFORTS ACROSS THE STATE. BUT USING AND ONE THAT WILL ACTUALLY OCCUR DEPENDS ON CHOICES WE MAKE AS WE ARE BUILDING THE CHARACTERS DAMAGE COMPLICATED THE LEGACY SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE. CURRENTLY ACTIVE UFC AND THAT'S LIKE AT THE PEAK PLAGUE. DOES NOT. THE TYPE OF PER CHILD CLEANING AND TRACKING THAT IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO CLAIM THAT FEDERAL DOLLARS. GOT THE LATEST FOR YOU CLEAN WILL BE ABLE TO START ALONG WITH THE PLAN I AM WE IMPLEMENT CARE EXPRESSION ONE WHICH IS PROJECTED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. IT'S CLEAR. THERE I ALSO A QUESTION ON THE AGENDA ABOUT THE STATUS OF FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE FERC PIECE THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE IMPACTED BY THE I AM THE ROLE- TO HELP THEM DETERMINE TRANSITION THEIR PROGRAM ODELS THAT THEY WILL NO LONGER BE IMPACTED BY THE I'M DE ABRIL. INITIAL DEADLINE TO SUBMIT TRANSITION PLANS- IN ORDER TAX THAT THAT'S AND- WHAT THE STANDARD WANTS TO MARCH FOURTH AND NOW WE'VE DONE BY THAT MYERS FOURTH DEADLINE AND WE ARE CAN WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A SECOND SUBMISSION DEADLINE IN ORDER TO ALLOW FTA KEEP EATING COUNTY TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO DEVELOP THEIR PLANS. SO FAR WE HAVE RECEIVED FIVE TRANSITION PLANS- AND FOR THOSE THAT HAVE SUBMITTED THE PLANS WHEN THEY'RE PRETTY BIG WE BELIEVE DEPARTMENT AT THAT TIME SHE BEGAN IN. MAY BUT GIVEN THAT WE ONLY RECEIVED THE FIVE PLANS WE ARE GOING TO ALLOW FOR THAT SECOND SUBMISSION AND WE'RE ACTUALLY PARTNERING WITH THE COUNTY AND STATE. CALL THERE IS- HEADWALL PARTNERS AT. OF HEALTH CARE SIR. TO DEVELOP A WEAPON I. TO PROVIDED. INFORMATION ON ACCESSING THE FUNDS- AND THE BEST PRACTICES AND MODELS BUT THAT. IN TRANSITION TO IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO SERVE OUR YET BUT UNDER PROGRAM MODEL THAT WILL NO LONGER HAVE THEM COMING WITHIN THE I AM DEEP ROLE- WE'RE CURRENTLY FINALIZING A DATE. THE WEAPON ARE- AND ALSO WORKING TO OBTAIN LEADING QUESTIONS FROM PROVIDE EVERYTHING COUNTY FOR MAKE SURE THAT WE FULLY ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL EIGHT AND- DEVELOPMENT OF THE PLAN. HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM JUSTIN FREITAS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IT'S JUST APPRAISED FOR FINANCE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THIS TIME ANGELES SHORT WITH THE L. A. L. THANK YOU VANGELIS RIGHT WITH THE L. A. L. I HAVE JUST SOME BRIEF COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS I'LL START WITH F. OF PSA PART FOR RELATED TO CONGREGATE CARE REQUIREMENTS AND THEN MOVE ON TO PART ONE RELATED TO PREVENTION SERVICES. AT SO FOR PART FOUR. AT THE STATE IS STILL IN THE EARLY MONTHS OF IMPLEMENTING- THE NEW FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS FROM CONGREGATE CARE. WITH THIS OF THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER WAYS TO INSURE- THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES WORKING WITH COUNTIES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. TO DETERMINE WHERE ANY CHALLENGES REMAIN AND WHAT ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE OR SUPPORT- MIGHT BE NEEDED TO ENSURE WE'RE MEETING ON THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS- SOME. QUESTIONS THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT COULD INCLUDE WHAT STEPS WITH THE DEPARTMENT TAKING TO UNDERSTAND ANY CHALLENGES OR OBSTACLES. THAT COUNTY OR OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ARE ENCOUNTERING WHILE IMPLEMENTING NEW CONGREGATE CARE REQUIREMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE WHAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OF CSF PROVIDING AND AT THE AT THE FACILITATING ANY WORK GROUPS ARE OTHER PROPHECIES INVOLVING STAKEHOLDERS- AND ARE THERE ANY OPPORTUNITIES. WITHIN ANY OF THESE. I ACTION THAT ALLEGES TO BE MORE INVOLVED IN THESE PROPERTIES TO HELP ENSURE EFFECTIVE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. AND I KNOW THAT- DEPUTY DIRECTOR SHORT DID SPEAK UP THAT TO SOME OF THE ON GOING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT'S HAPPENING EARLIER- MOVING ON TO PART ONE OF ADVOCATES SAY- AS YOU HEARD FROM- THIS HOSPITAL. WE KNOW THAT THERE IS PARTICULAR CONCERN FROM STAKEHOLDERS OVER HOW TO TRACK PER CHILD PREVENTION SPENDING. WHICH IS FEDERALLY REQUIRED FOR COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO BEGIN CLAIMING TITLE FORTY FINE FOR ELIGIBLE PREVENTION SERVICES AND SUCH TRACKING IS BEYOND CALIFORNIA'S- CHILD WELFARE DATA SYSTEM CURRENT CAPACITY- THANK YOU FOR AS YOU JUST HEARD FROM DEPUTY DIRECTOR SUPPORT- NOT. THE PLAN IS TO INTEGRATE THIS REPORTING CAPACITY INTO THE FOURTH COMING- CARES. OF THE NEW CHILD WELFARE DATA SYSTEM WHICH REMAINS UNDER DEVELOPMENT- HOWEVER IT'S NOT CLEAR TO US AT THIS TIME IF SOME SORT OF INTERIM SOLUTION AS POSSIBLE THAT WOULD ALLOW AND COUNTIES TO BE AGAIN- LEVERAGING THOSE TITLE FORTY FEDERAL FUNDS WAITING FOR THE CARE SYSTEM TO COME ONLINE- ADDITIONALLY HAVE YOU HEARD FROM THIS HOSPITAL STAKEHOLDERS HAVE SOME CONCERN THAT PREVENTION SERVICES INCLUDED IN THE STATE TITLE FORTY PREVENTION PLAN- ARE LIMITED- AND WITH THAT IN MIND WE- SOME SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO ASK YES THAT. SPECIFIC ISSUE APART ONE OF PSA COULD INCLUDE WHAT FEEDBACK HAS THE DEPARTMENT RECEIVED FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND HOW IS THE DEPARTMENT INCORPORATING THAT FEED BACK INTO THE STATE'S PREVENTION PLAN REPORTING SOLUTION. PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF THE CARE. THAT WOULD ALLOW COUNTIES TO BEGIN CLAIM MAIN TITLE FORTY DOLLARS SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM KATHY SANDERLING MCDONALD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR C. WTA PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST KEVIN CENTER LENGTHY BDA- REGARDING PART ONE I WAS ASKED TO TALK A BIT ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SERVING CHILDREN FAMILIES WITH- PART ONE GIVES US. SO SEVEN BACK FOR A MINUTE- REMEMBER THAT ARE PART ONE AS MS SCHWARTZ NOTED ALLOWS. STATE SEN IN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES TO DRAWDOWN TITLE FOR EACH FUNDING FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR SERVICES TO FAMILIES UP UNTIL THIS POINT WE'VE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO DRAW THAT FUNDING DOWN FOR PLACEMENT. YEAH A PLACEMENT SPENDING SO YOU KNOW A FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT ON CONGREGATE CARE PLACEMENTS AND SO IT'S LIMITED- IT'S MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND IN HOME PARENTING SERVICES FOR THE MOST PART ADDITIONALLY SOME SERVICES FOR PARENTING YEARS WHO ARE IN OUR SYSTEM. OF IN PARTICULAR ARE AS WELL THERE ARE A NUMBER OF RULES THAT MUST BE FOLLOWED I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS FOR YOU KNOW THE DISCUSSION OF THAT THE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE PROVIDING THE NECESSARY CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT INFORMATION IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO FULLY CLAIM THAT TITLE FOR EACH. FOR EXAMPLE IF THE SERVICES ESPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES CAN BE FUNDED THROUGH THE MEDICAID PROGRAM THROUGH MEDICARE ALL THEN THAT IS SORT OF THE FIRST RESORT PAYER ENTITLED FORTY BY THE LOCK IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE LAST RESORT PAYER SO THERE'S SOME LAYERS TO KIND OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE FUNDING. AS WELL AS YOU HEARD- THERE'S THESE CATEGORIES THAT LAND A PROGRAM ON THIS CLEARING HOUSE THEY NEED TO BE PROMISING SUPPORTED OR WELL SUPPORTED OTHERS DEFINITIONS OF THOSE IN THE LAW AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS WELL AS- REQUIREMENTS FOR HOW MUCH OF THE STATE SPENDING OR COUNTY SPENDING. IN OUR CASE WOULD NEED TO BE IN EACH OF THOSE CATEGORIES ANOTHER SET OF REQUIREMENTS OF LAYERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MEETING. SO. WHAT THE PROPOSAL THAT CHILL NOW INSTEAD OF THE A CO SPONSOR. AND WAS A BY LATEST. TO BUY THE NEW DEMONSTRATION STUFF BY MORE THAN EIGHTY. THIS PAST BUGET CYCLE WAS TO PROVIDE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AND WE USE THAT PART ONE AS A JUMPING OFF POINT. THE ISSUE HERE IS WE KNOW IT'S NOT THE END ALL BE ALL THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION THAT WE SAW WHEN IT WAS UNDER DISCUSSION T THE FEDERAL LEVEL. IN A MUCH MORE ROBUST SET OF SERVICES AND WE KNOW THAT PREVENTION SERVICES GO WELL BEYOND MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND IN HOME PARENTING SERVICES THERE'S- A WHOLE LOT MORE SERVICES THAT A FAMILY COULD NEED. IN ORDER TO AVOID NOT JUST TO BE SURE TO COLLECT BUT LIKE WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE AVOID FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT. AND SO WHAT WE WANT TO TRY TO DO WITH THIS PROPOSAL. IS TO ENSURE THAT THE FUNDING CAN BE USED NOT JUST FOR THOSE CLEARING HOUSE. FEDERALLY SERVICES WE CAN PROVIDE. AND DRIED OUT TITLE FOR EACH FOR. THEIR SERVICES TO AND FOR THE GENERAL FUND AND HOW IT WAS STRUCTURED IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET ALLOWS COUNTIES TO DO THIS. THE IDEA IS TO PARTNER WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE. AND REALLY TRY TO TACKLE THE DISPARITIES AND THE DISPROPORTIONATE ALITY THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT ON PART ONE THAT. WE TALKED ABOUT LAST YEAR AS WELL. WE ARE YOU KNOW THE- WE DON'T DON'T WANT TO CAL TO MARK OF THE CLIPBOARD SAY WE KNOW WHAT YOU NEED TO COMMUNITY BUT INSTEAD TO REALLY PARTNER MEANINGFULLY IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND ALYSSA. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU NEED HOW CAN WE BRING OUR RESOURCE CENTER IN ORDER TO BEAR AND AN- INCREASE SERVICES THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE. CREATE NEW SERVICES AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE CULTURALLY RELEVANT EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT ON THAT CLEARING HOUSE LIST IDEALLY WE COULD TRY TO HELP BUILD THAT DATA. AND BUILD THAT SORT OF RESEARCH BASE TO BE ABLE TO EVENTUALLY GET PROGRAMS LIKE THAT ON THE CLEARING HOUSE. BUT THE FUNDING THAT YOU SUPPORTED AND PUT INTO PLAY AND THAT'S AVAILABLE NOW- OR SOON WE HOPE IS GOING TO ENABLE US TO NOT JUST DRIED OUT FOR EACH. ONLY FOR THE LIMITED SERVICES BUT TO DO A MUCH BROADER- APPROACH TO PREVENTION. OF THAT WE THINK IS REALLY THE BETTER WAY TO GO. AND SO- KIND OF WHERE WE ARE I MEAN YOU'VE HEARD THE FINDINGS NOT YET FULLY OUT THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT YET FULLY OUT. OF IT WE KNOW WHAT IT TAKES MORE TIME TO GET MONEY OUT THE DOOR THERE WERE A LOT OF INVESTMENTS IN CHILD WELFARE- AND WE DID NEED TO GET OUR PREVENTION PLAN APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BUT IT IS MARCH AND SO WE ARE VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE MATERIALS IMAGE TOWARDS MENTION- AND SINCE IT DOESN'T RELY. ON US OUR ABILITY TO TALK TO CLAIM TITLE FOR HE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THE CARE SYSTEM IS NOT THERE YET- IT'S A COMPLICATED SET OF- CLAIMING TO REALLY AUTOMATE. BUT WE CAN GET GOING ON THIS WE DON'T HAVE TO JUST WAIT FOR CARE AND WAIT UNTIL WE CAN PLAN FOR EACH. COUNTIES CAN START WORKING WITH THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES NOW AND START YOU IDEALLY PROVIDE THE SERVICES FUNDING SERVICES. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITIES AND. GET GOING ON THAT SO THAT WE CAN WILL WE START TO TAP. WHAT WE KNOW OUR THESE LONG STANDING DESPAIR. AND JUST BEFORE. AND TO REALLY INCREASE EQUITY INTEREST OF AND SO. FAMILIES STRENGTHEN FAMILIES AVOID FOSTER CARE- I'LL JUST SAY- WAFTING ON THIS PART ONE QUESTION. IS WE CERTAINLY WOULD BE INTERESTED IN EXPLORING AN INTERIM SOLUTION- ACT NOTED BY- BY THE L. A. L. O. THAT THERE MAY BE SOME OPTIONS- WE KNOW WHAT WOULD NOT BE IDEAL THE IDEAL IS TO GET CARE- PROGRAMS. THERE'S A LOT TO DO ONE CARES AND- PROGRAMMING DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE COULD HELP TO CREATE THAT INTERIM SOLUTION. TO NOT ONLY STANDS THE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS ON GOOD SERVICES BUT ALSO DRIVE DOWN FOR EACH FOR THOSE THAT WE CAN- WERE UP WERE. ALL IN ON THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO HELP WITH THAT. ON FOUR WE'RE ALL AFTER- SHARE SOME THOUGHTS ON THE CHALLENGES FROM COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES ON PARK FOR- SO FAR I THINK THAT THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE HAS JUST BEEN THAT- PURPORT TOOK EFFECT ON OCTOBER FIRST OF LAST YEAR. UNFORTUNATELY MOST OF THE STATE GUIDANCE ON IMPLEMENTATION JUST CAME OUT A DAY OR SO A DAY OR TWO BEFORE THAT OCTOBER FIRST ST AGAIN IT WAS A LUMINOUS IT WAS. A LOT FOR THE STATE TO GET TOGETHER- IT DID LEAVE COUNTY IS KIND OF SCRAMBLING TO TRY TO IMPLEMENTED WE DID. MAKE SURE TO LET THE ADMINISTRATION KNOW THAT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO AVOID THAT AS OF THAT OCTOBER FIRST ST- WE DO APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDED COUNTIES WITH A TEMPORARY FUNDING- TO ADDRESS ISSUES SUCH AS WHAT A COURT. MIGHT OVERRULE THAT QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL RECOMMENDATION I'M PLACE TO USE THAT TO ASK YOUR GP ANYWAY OR WHEN WE USE THE FACILITY THAT HAVEN'T YET BEEN ACCREDITED. GIVEN THAT NEWLY LICENSED AFTER YOUR GPS YOU HAVE UP TO TWO YEARS TO BECOME ACCREDITED- REALLY WANT TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR PARTNERING WITH US ON THAT ISSUE WHICH IS A VERY REAL ISSUE- AND SO WE DEFINITELYHAVE ALSO BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH HER COUNTY PARTNERS. AT THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH DIRECTORS PROBATION CHIEFS UNEMPLOYMENT HE SAID ISSUES AS WELL AS PDFS NVH THE ACT AS ISSUES ARISE. I WILL JUST CONTINUE TODAY OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS I'M TRYING TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS THESE WHERE WE CAN WITHIN THE FEDERAL STRUCTURE THAT WE MUST LIVE WITHIN. AND ENSURE THAT COUNTIES ARE ADEQUATELY FUNDED FOR THE WORK- AND I DO JUST WANT TO CLARIFY FROM THE PRIOR PANEL CONVERSATION THAT- THESE QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS. ARE NOT COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES STAFF OTHER COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STAFF THAT WAS WRITTEN INTO THE STATUTE- AND WE DO APPRECIATE THE SUGGESTIONS THAT MAY SHORT PROVIDED ON. CONTINUING TO TAKE A LOOK TOGETHER AND HOW WE'RE- AT PER FOR. I THINK- TELL WAS WERE A LEAD. AND A LOT OF WHAT YOU SEE WERE. IN THAT FOR LAW. PRACTICE WE NICE TO WHAT WE STARTED DOING NOW YOU KNOW WITH RCC ARE YEARS AND YEARS AGO BUT THERE WERE SOME DIFFERENCES AND THERE ARE SOME CHANGES I NOW YOU KNOW I'M I'M THE STARTER MERZ I WILL ADDRESS A LOT OF THAT I THINK FROM HER. MEMBERS PERSPECTIVE BUT CERTAINLY FROM OUR MEMBERS PERSPECTIVE THERE'S A LOT OF CHANGES AND IT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA TO CAN YOU TALKING ABOUT HOW THAT'S GOING AND- YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE DO WE NEED. FOR THE LEGISLATURE FROM THE STATE IN OUR STATE LAW FROM OUR PARTNERS TO BE ABLE TO DO IT RIGHT. NOW THANK YOU AND AGAIN HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ONLY GET TO THAT POINT. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM CHRISTY CHRIS STONER MARKED. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHEN ARAMBULA BOB WE WERE ASKED TO RESPOND TO TWO QUESTIONS THE FIRST OF WHICH- WAS VERY SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO S. T. R. C. P.'S SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS AND HOW- A TATIAN. OR F. PSA WAS OCCURRING AND THEN SECONDLY TO ANSWER HOW THE STATE CAN IMPROVE ON ITS IMPLEMENTATION OF FF'S PSA PARK FOR- THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A PSA HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT. IMPACTS HONEST YEAR KEEP. AS OF SOME OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS HAVE MENTIONED. AS A CLOSER REVIEW OF FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS OCCURRED IT BECAME CLEAR THE S. T. R. T. P.'S WITH MORE THAN SIXTEEN BEDS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE AT RISK OF BEING DEEMED AN INSTITUTION FOR MENTAL DISEASES OR AND I AM DE. UNDER THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE'S REGULATIONS- DH CS IS CURRENTLY WORKING TO REVIEW S. T. R. T. P. IS AND WILL MAKE THESE DETERMINATIONS THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THIS YEAR AND BY THE END OF DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WHAT CAMPUS SPACE S. T. R. T. P. IS WITH MORE THAN SIXTEEN BEDS WHO ARE MOST AT RISK OF THIS DESIGNATION SUBSTANTIAL ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES MUST BE MADE. AND EVEN WITH THESE CHANGES A LOSS OF THIS TO YOUR GP OPTIONS FOR YOUTH WILL RESULT IN THE NEXT NINE MONTHS. IT'S HARD TO CALCULATE WHAT THE EXACT NUMBER WILL BE- OUR ESTIMATES RANGE RANGE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVEN HUNDRED TREATMENT BEDS. PSA WAS DESIGNED WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT FACILITY SERVING THE HIGHEST RISK YOU ARE IN THE SAME COUNTY AS THE PLACING AGENCY. THE NATURE OF FUNDING IN CALIFORNIA RESULTS IN A WELL ABOVE COMPLEXITY FROM ISSUES RELATED TO PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER TO THE NEED TO ENSURE STABLE TRÊN STABLE TRANSITIONS THROUGH AFTER CARE SERVICES AS PART OF PARK FOR. MUCH OF THE BURDEN ON MANAGING THESE COMPLEXITIES FALLS ON PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS PANEL THE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO CREATE THE S. T. R. T. P. RATE UNDER C. C. R. WERE FLAWED AND THE CURRENT RATE STRUCTURE DOES NOT ADEQUATELY FUND THE INTENSE LEVEL OF SERVICES AND STAFFING REQUIRED TO EFFECTIVELY TREAT AND SUPPORT YOUTH IN TRANSITIONING TO FAMILY BASED CARE. COVERT NINETEEN HAS ALSO DRASTICALLY IMPACTED S. T. R. T. P.'S WHO CONTINUE TO WAIT FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF PASSED IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET. WHICH COVERED ONLY 25% OF THE TOTAL LOSS OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES INCURRED BY ORGANIZATIONS. THE ALLIANCE IS SPONSORING BUDGET REQUEST TO ADDRESS BOTH THE REVIEW AND ADJUSTMENT OF THE RATE AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL COBIT RELIEF TO COVER ADDITIONAL LOSSES. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL PROCESS HAS BEEN CHALLENGING AS- AS OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED AND WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE SOME OF THESE IMPACTS AT THE S. T. R. T. P. LEVEL NOW. AGAIN THIS REQUIRES ONGOING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COUNTIES AND PROVIDERS THAT WILL LIKELY BE NEEDED FOR QUITE SOME TIME AS WE CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT THESE NEW REGULATIONS. IN TERMS OF- THOUGHTS OF THE STATE MIGHT IMPROVE IMPLEMENTATION OF PART FOUR- I FIRST HAVE TO SAY THAT THE ON GOING AFTER THE PSA TECHNICAL CALLS HAVE BEEN HELPFUL- AND CDSS STAFF HAS ALSO BEEN VERY ACCESSIBLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AS THEY COME UP. ON A ONE TO ONE BASIS S. T. R. T. P. IS AND THEY'RE COUNTY PARTNERS NEED MORE DIRECT GUIDANCE AROUND FF PM PHONE BUT IMPLEMENTATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. BECAUSE MANY OF SECURITY PEAS ARE SERVING YOUTH FROM MULTIPLE COUNTIES COORDINATION IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT DISCUSSIONS ARE TAKING PLACE WITH EACH OF THE ORGANIZATIONS AND PARTICULARLY THE LARGER ONES AT MOST RISK. AN ACTIVE PLANNING TO ENSURE STABILITY FOR THE USE. IS HAPPENING- THE SCHWARTZ- TALKED ABOUT THE TRANSITION PLANNING FUNDING WHICH WE WERE VERY GRATEFUL TO GET AND- ALSO CONTINUE TO THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE COORDINATION AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED SO WE'RE HAPPY TO HEAR. THAT BE DOING MORE AROUND THAT. MANY MANY ASK YOUR GP IS ACTUALLY BEEN IN THE POSITION OF ACTUAL OF EDUCATING PARTNERS AROUND THESE COMPLEXITIES BECAUSE IT IT'S THERE'S A LOT OF TECHNICAL SPECIFICITY THAT HAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD- AND THAT OF COURSE OF COURSE WORKING WITH MULTIPLE COUNTY'S AGAIN VERY CHALLENGING FOR ORGANIZATIONS. ENCOURAGING ENGAGING THESE AUSTERITY P. ISN'T PLANNING FOR AFTER CARE SERVICES IS ALSO CRITICAL ALTHOUGH EACH COUNTY WILL NEED TO DEVELOP A PLAN. ORGANIZATIONS SERVING YOUTH FROM MULTIPLE COUNTIES NEED COORDINATION WITH ALL OF THOSE COUNTIES WE'VE GOT TO STAY FOCUSED ON CONTINUITY OF CARE FOR THESE YOUTH REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A YOUNG PERSON IS BEING IS ACCESSING SERVICES ACROSS COUNTY LINES. CONTINUED SUPPORT AND CA IS NEEDED REGARDING THE QUEUE WAITING QUEUE I PROCESS. AND TO ENSURE THAT THE F. SECURITY KEYS ARE NOT BEARING THE BURDEN OF A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING RELATED TO HOW THE QUEUE I ASSESSMENT AND THE PLACING AGENCY PROCESSES INTERACT.

THANK YOU TO PHONE NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM SIMONE TURRET TO LEAVE WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF HOUSING AND HEALTH WITH THE JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH PLEASE BEGIN FOR INCLUDING ME ON THIS PANEL- AGAIN MY NAME IS THE MON TEREK LEE AND I'M WITH JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH. OUR STATE HAVE BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE TO THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS AMONG YOUTH EXITING FOSTER CARE I DON'T HAVE TO MENTION YOU KNOW TO FIND JUST MENTIONED- EXTENDING SUPPORT FOR YOUTH WHO. I WOULD HAVE AGED OUT DURING CARE- DURING THE PANDEMIC H. OUT FROM CARE- AT TWENTY ONE BEING ABLE TO REMAINING CARE- WAS OBVIOUSLY A HUGE- IMPORTANT INVESTMENT MADE BY THE STATE. I THINK THE STATE HAS ALSO LONG RECOGNIZED THE HOMELESSNESS RISK OF THE POPULATION TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE ESTABLISH THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM CLASS FOR THP PLUS. IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO ALARMING RATE THE HOMELESSNESS AMONG FORMER FOSTER YOUTH THE PROGRAM IS STILL THRIVING TODAY AND FORTY SEVEN COUNTIES AND PROVIDES UP TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO YOUTH WHO LEAVE FOSTER CARE OR OUT OF FROM PROBATION UP UNTIL THEY TURN TWENTY FOUR. THE PROGRAM SERVED ABOUT THIRTEEN HUNDRED YOU'VE GOT A MOMENT IN TIME AND YOU FIFTIES P. PLUS MAKE PROGRESS IN EDUCATION APPOINTMENT DURING THEIR TIME IN THE PROGRAM AND THE VAST MAJORITY. AT THE TO STABLE HOUSING. SB PLUS WITH RELY TO THE ELEVEN SO WHEN WE LEARN THE FOR THE PROGRAM SIGNIFICANTLY OUTWEIGHED THE PROGRAM'S CAPACITY. THE STATE ESTABLISHED A NEW STATE FUNDING SOURCE THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM. ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. THE MAJORITY OF THE FUNDING IS BEING USED TO EXPAND LOCAL TV PLUS PROGRAM. AND SO FAR OUT THAT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT ENABLE COUNTIES TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF YOU THINK THIRD BY OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS. THE STATE ALSO RECENTLY INVESTED IN THE THP PLUS HOUSING SUPPLEMENT PROGRAM ALSO ADMINISTERED BY HDD. TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE HI SCOTT COUNTIES HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO PAY MONTHLY RATES TO THEIR PROVIDERS. THAT ARE HIGH ENOUGH TO AFFORD LOCAL RENTAL CAR. IF NINE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IS BEING IMPLEMENTED IN WILL SOON BENEFIT SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE YOU ACROSS SIX HIGH COST COUNTIES. ON AND TELL HIM TO THE NECK QUESTION. YES PLEASE TO THE HOUSING NEEDS THAT REMAIN UNMET FOR FORMER FOSTER YOUTH REALLY THE NUMBER I NEED A FORMER FOSTER YOUTH IN THE AREA OF HOUSING IS WE NEED MORE OF IT- THESE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE NAVIGATING SOME OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE HOUSING MARKET THE COUNTRY WITH NO REAL RENTAL HISTORY AND AVERAGE ANNUAL INCOME OF LESS THAN TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND NO ONE TO COSIGN WITH THEM OR OFTENTIMES TO REALLY GUIDE THEM- THE PANDEMIC HAS REALLY KIND OF SHOWN A FLASHLIGHT ON THE DISPARITY BETWEEN YOU COMING FROM FOSTER CARE AND YOUTH AND THE GENERAL POPULATION. WHO ARE ON AVERAGE YOU KNOW LIVING WITH THEIR PARENTS INTO THEIR THIRTIES AT THIS POINT AT THE END OF THE LAST FISCAL YEAR THERE WERE FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE YOU ON THE WAITING LIST FOR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING THAT'S ACTUALLY AN UNDERSTATEMENT BECAUSE THAT THAT EXTENSION OF CARE THAT OCTAPHARMA MENTIONED IN THAT I REFERENCED IN THE BEGINNING OF MY REMARKS- SO AT A MINIMUM WE REALLY NEED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS MORE INVESTED IN THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM TO INCREASE CAPACITY BY AT LEAST FOURTEEN SEVENTY THREE YEAR. BUT WE ALSO NEED THESE PROGRAMS TO BE RESPONSIVE TO YOU TO REQUIRE LINK YOUR SUPPORT IN TWO YEARS THIS INCLUDES YOUTH COMPLETING SCHOOL YOU COOK DISABILITIES AND SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES THAT YOUNG PARENTS AND OTHERS- AND INVESTMENT OF AN ADDITIONAL TEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS COULD ADD ONE MORE YEAR TO THE CHIEF OF PROGRAM MODEL USED BY COUNTIES WITHOUT GROWING WAITING LISTS AND LASTLY WE ARE TAPPING INTO A KEY FEDERAL RESOURCE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. AND OUR DIRECTOR SHORTS- REFERENCE THIS BRIEFLY EARLIER. YOU DEPARTMENT OF. AND- URBAN DEVELOPMENT ADMIN TO. PER FOR FORMER. YOUTH AGES EIGHTEEN THROUGH TWENTY FOUR. THE FAMILY UNIFICATION PROGRAM OR FOX. AND APOSS USED INDEPENDENT FINISHES FYI. BOTH PROGRAMS PROVIDE HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHERS ADMINISTERED LOCALLY BY PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITIES COUPLED WITH THE PORT OF SERVICES PROVIDED BY COUNTY CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES. WHILE THE VOUCHER IS FUNDED BY HON. THERE IS NO DESIGNATED FUNDING FOR THE THIRD WITH THAT. MANY COUNTIES REPORT OBSTACLES IN UTILIZING THE FEDERAL RESOURCE AND AT THE END OF THE LAST FISCAL YEAR. THERE WERE EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY ABOUT TRUTH IN OUR STATE AND JUST TWO HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT OF THEM WERE FY I ABOUT TRUTH WHICH CAN BE REQUESTED. ON DEMAND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THESE ARE IT SHOULD BE ACCEPTABLE VOUCHERS. SOME COUNTIES DO NOT REQUEST VOUCHERS FOR THE REQUEST TO FEEL BECAUSE THEY CANNOT OFFER THE REQUIRED SERVICES WITHOUT DEDICATED FUNDING. IN COUNTIES WITHOUT YOUR LEVEL OF HOUSING NAVIGATION SUPPORT PROVIDED REALLY VERY. AND IT'S OFTEN NOT ENOUGH IN SOME COUNTY THAT REQUIRES SIX TO NINE MONTHS TO CONVERT ABOUT HER THE ACTUAL HOUSING. BURGER HOUSING AUTHORITY CANNOT REQUEST ADDITIONAL DOCTORS AND LYFT 90% OF THEIR EXISTING DOCTOR ARE UTILIZED. MEANING IN ACTIVE LEASES. IT MEANS THAT EVEN WHEN DOCTORS ARE IN CIRCULATION. IF YOU ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND HOUSING HOUSING AUTHORITY CANNOT REQUEST ADDITIONAL VOUCHERS AND YOUTH WHO ARE IN NEED REMAIN ON THE WAITING LIST. WHICH TOTAL TWO HUNDRED NINETY YOUTH AT THE END OF THE LAST FISCAL YEAR. AN INVESTMENT OF EIGHT POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE STATE EXISTING HOUSING NAVIGATORS PROGRAM. AN INCREASE IN THE UPPER AGE LIMIT TO ALIGN WITH FACTOR AGE ELIGIBILITY. WOULD PROVIDE COUNTIES WITH FUNDING TO IMPROVE UTILIZATION OF THE FEDERAL VOUCHER. THE STATE HAS RECOGNIZED THE NEED FOR THE FUNDING THROUGH A SHORT TERM PILOT PROPOSED FOR EXTENSION AS REFERENCED BY DIRECTOR SHORT. INVESTMENT OR RECOMMENDING WOULD ADDRESS THIS IN THE LONG TERM. INVESTMENT THAT MENTIONED TO TOTAL THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM. AND HOW THE NAVIGATORS PROGRAM OPENED MINISTER BY HDD AND. SITUATED IN BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE FOR PARTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND FOR A WHOLE FROM. HEARING THANK YOU NEXT HEAR FROM JIM PER WHO THE INTERIM LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES DIRECTOR PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS AGAIN MENTION YOUR PRIOR ON THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES IT IS A PRIVILEGE TO BE A PART OF TODAY'S DISCUSSION ENJOYING LISTING PARTNERS ON THIS PANEL. AS AS THE LARGEST CHILD WELFARE AGENCY IN THE NATION WE CONSTANTLY FACE THE IMPORTANT ISSUES OF COMPLEX CARE TRANSITION AGE YOUTH NEEDS AS WELL AS WORKFORCE AND CAPACITY CHALLENGES. WE KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR THE CHILDREN NEWS IN FAMILIES WE SIR AND TO PREVENT ENTRY INTO THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY REASONS WHY OUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS JUST CO SPONSORING A PROPOSAL FOR TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO MAINTAIN CHILD WELFARE SERVICES. ANGELES COUNTY HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN PREVENTION WORK FOR SOME TIME AND IS NOW IN THE MIDST OF TRANSITIONING TO THE FAMILY FIRST PREVENTION SERVICES BACK ARE AFFECT TSA. NOW MORE THAN EVER WE NEED TO OFFER CRITICAL SERVICES AND SUPPORTS SOCIAL WORKERS IN THEIR ENDEAVOR TO HELP STRENGTHEN FAMILIES SO THAT CHILDREN. BRING YOUR MAIN SAFELY AT HOME. I WORKFORCE IS. SOCIAL WORKERS AND OTHER CHILD WELFARE PROFESSIONALS I'M IN THIS LITERALLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOLS THAT WE HAVE. IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM TO ENSURE THE SAFETY AND WELLBEING OF ABUSED AND NEGLECTED CHILDREN. THIS OF COURSE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE BUT AS A LIFELONG CHILD WELFARE PROFESSIONAL I CAN ATTEST. THAT DUE TO THE SEVERE STRESSES ON FAMILIES. AND THE TREMENDOUS TRAUMA MANY OF THE CHILDREN IN OUR SYSTEM HAVE EXPERIENCE IT HAS NEVER BEEN SO IMPORTANT TO HAVE A WELL STAFFED. AND WELL TRAINED WORKFORCE WORKERS WHO HAVE TIME. TRAINING AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND THAT THEY NEED AND THAT THEY DESERVE. BECAUSE OF THIS WORKFORCE REALITY THE COUNTY HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN STAFFING AND SERVICES TO PRESERVE CHILD SAFETY AND REUNIFY FAMILIES. WITHOUT THE REQUESTED TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY ON THE ALLOCATION WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT BEING FORCED TO MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS ABOUT STAFFING. THAT COULD IMPACT REX SERVICES TO CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE. SO WHAT ARE THE MAIN CHALLENGES FACING LOS ANGELES COUNTY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CHANGES IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. MULTIPLE OVERLAPPING FACTORS SUCH AS LOSS OF FUNDS AND FLEXIBILITY WITH THE TITLE FOURTEEN LABOR. VASTLY INCREASED EXTENDED FOSTER CARE COST INSUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR STATE MANDATED PROGRAMS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO OUR STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. THE NINETEEN NINETY ONE AND TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN REALIGNMENT SHIFTED FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY FROM THE STATE. TO COUNTIES FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS WHICH AFFECTED FUNDING FOR THE CHILD WELFARE POPULATION. SO FOR EXAMPLE AB TWELVE EXPANDED THIS POPULATION WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN REVENUES AS WAS ANTICIPATED AND ORIGINALLY INTENDED BY THE LEGISLATURE. RESULTING IN LARGE AND GROWING EFC COSTS FOR THE COUNTY. ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL THERE WAS A LOSS OF FLEXIBILITY IN FUNDING THAT CAME WITH THE TITLE FORTY WAIVER WITHOUT CHILD WELFARE FINANCING REFORM TO ADDRESS. DECLINING FEDERAL ELIGIBILITY ALL. ANTIQUATED INTO PRESS. AND LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY THE NINETEEN NINETY SIX EIGHT TO FAMILY. WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN A FTC LOOK BACK BECAUSE THE NON FEDERAL SHARE COSTS ON TO GROW CONCERT- SIGNIFICANTLY. THE COUNTY HAS MADE AND IS MAKING LARGE INVESTMENTS IN CRITICAL CHILD WELFARE SERVICES TO PRODUCE BETTER OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. AMONG THE INVESTMENTS MADE OUR- DCFS HIRED OVER A THOUSAND SOCIAL WORKERS AND TWO HUNDRED SUPERVISING CHILDREN'S SOCIAL WORKERS OF NOTE. COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INVESTMENTS INCREASE ANNUALLY WE HAVE ALSO INVESTED IN SERVICES SUCH AS PREVENTION AFTER CARE NETWORK'S UPFRONT FAMILY FINDING. PLACEMENT STABILIZATION SCHOOL STABILITY AND TRANSPORTATION MEDICAL HUBS AND SCHOOLS LGBTQ PLUS SERVICES AND OUR OFFICE OF EQUITY. THE ANNUAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST WILL HELP THE COUNTY MAINTAIN THESE CRITICAL CHILD WELFARE SERVICES. WOW WHAT ARE PRIORITY CONCERNS MOVING FORWARD AND WHAT ARE THE FORESEEABLE IMPACTS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES AS WELL AS THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM STAFF EMPLOYED BY THE COUNTY. THE COUNTY IS CONCERNED ABOUT BEING FORCED TO MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS ABOUT STAFFING AND OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT CAN IMPACT DIRECT SERVICES TO THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE. IF WE DO NOT RECEIVE THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET REQUEST THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS COULD INCLUDE THE COUNTY REVERTING BACK TO STAFFING LEVELS THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE RECENT CRITICAL INVESTMENTS. LOWER STAFFING LEVELS WILL RESULT IN INCREASED CASELOADS AND WORKLOADS LEADING TO AT RISK CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES RECEIVING LESS INDIVIDUALIZED SUPPORT INCLUDING THOSE WITH COMPLEX NEEDS. NEGATIVE IMPACT ON TIMELY RESPONSES TO YOU ENCLOSURE OF REFERRALS REUNIFICATION AND- OF VIRTUAL TRAINING AND USE LESS SUPPORT OF TRANSITION AGE YOUTH TO HELP THEM DEVELOP SELF SUFFICIENCY SKILLS. AND LINK THEM TO MUCH NEEDED COMMUNITY RESOURCES ON BEHALF OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY I ASK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON OUR BUDGET PROPOSAL AND YOUR PARTNERSHIP TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE DEPARTMENT STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. AND IT'S POTENTIAL HARMFUL IMPACT AFFORDABLE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM TIFFANY WHITENED WITH SEIU. CALIFORNIA PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. TIFFANY WHITE WITH THAT YEAH YOU CALIFORNIA- AGAIN THANK YOU DOCTOR ARAMBULA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY I'LL BE RESPONDING TO TWO QUESTIONS PROVIDED BY THE COMMITTEE SO I'LL JUST JUMP RIGHT IN THE FIRST QUESTION IS HOW HAVE INVESTMENTS THAT L. A. COUNTY MADE HELPED WORKERS PROVIDE BETTER SERVICES TO CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. INVESTMENTS HAVE GONE A LONG WAY AND HAVE HAD A REAL EFFECT ON LIVES BOTH THE WORKERS AND THE FAMILIES THEY SERVED I THINK WE CAN WE HEARD BACK FROM THIS- PRIOR JUST A MINUTE AGO THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING HELPED INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SOCIAL WORKERS WHICH IN RETURN HELPS REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CASES EACH WORKER MAINTAINED A REDUCTION IN CASELOAD ALLOW THE EXISTING FAMILIES AND THE NEW FAMILIES TO RECEIVE THE PROPER SIR SUPPORT AND SERVICES THEY NEED IT. ADDITIONAL WORKERS ALSO ALLOWED FOR SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED IN A MORE TIMELY MANNER AND ALLOW FOR PREVENTATIVE MEASURES TO BE TAKEN IN ORDER TO BETTER SERVE AND MITIGATE ANY FUTURE NEEDS IT'S IMPORTANT FOR CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES TO RECEIVE CONTINUITY OF SERVICES SO ANOTHER INVESTMENT THAT WAS INSTITUTED WAS A PROGRAM DESIGNED TO HELP SUPPORT THE SOCIAL WORKER AND PROVIDE CONTINUITY OF SERVICES AMONG OTHER THINGS. THE PROGRAM PARTNERED NEW AND RECENTLY HIRED WORKERS IT SEASONED WORKERS AND CREATED A MENTOR SHIP PROGRAM THAT PROVED TO BE VALUABLE AND ALSO REDUCE TURNOVER WHICH ULTIMATELY PROVIDED BETTER CONTINUITY OF SERVICES WE HAVE SEEN THAT IF THE WORKERS ARE BEING INVESTED IN AND SUPPORTED OUTCOMES WHAT'S REALLY BE BETTER FOR ALL. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF AN INVESTMENT THAT TRULY MADE A DIFFERENCE WITH THE MOU BETWEEN LA DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES AND THE LA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE MO YOU CONNECTED A PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE WITH THE SOCIAL WORKER AND THEY WENT ON EMERGENCY RESPONSE CALLS TOGETHER. THIS PROVED TO BE BENEFICIAL ON A NUMBER OF LEVELS AGAIN THE SOCIAL WORKER WAS SUPPORTED WITH THE ASSISTANCE FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONAL BUT ULTIMATELY THE PAIR WAS ABLE TO BETTER SERVE THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND IN SOME CASES ENSURE THAT FAMILIES WITH HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS RECEIVE THE SERVICES NECESSARY WHICH REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT WERE BROUGHT INTO CARE. HAVING THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY I AM. RAPPER SERVICE. IS CRUCIAL FOR THE WELL BEING OF CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. HAVING THE PROPER ONGOING FUNDING AND SUPPORT LEADS TO BETTER OUTCOMES FOR CHILD. OR CHILD SAFETY WELL BEING A PERMANENCY AND THEY USE SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION TO INDEPENDENCE. THESE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES TO ADD TO THE ONCE AGAIN THEM AS PRIOR INDICATED- EARLIER AND TOGETHER THESE INVESTMENTS. DEMONSTRATE THE NEED AND IMPORTANCE FOR THE CONTINUED INVESTMENTS. L. A. COUNTY IS CLOSE TO MEET IN HE S. B. TWENTY THIRTY TWO. I'M THIRTY SOCIAL WORKER A STAFFING RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE CONTINUED FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS WILL HELP KEEP THEM ON TRACK TO DO JUST THAT. THE SECOND QUESTION IS WHAT ARE. YOUR WORKERS WORRIED ABOUT IF THIS FUNDING IS NOT PROVIDED TO L. A. COUNTY. SIMPLY PUT OUR WORKERS ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE CHILDREN AND THE FAMILIES THAT THEY SERVE. AS DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANTS THEIR PRIMARY GOAL AND FOCUS IS ON THE WELL BEING OF CHILDREN AND THE FAMILY AS A WHOLE. ABSENT THIS CONTINUED FUNDING THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT WOULD GO WITHOUT SERVICES AND THE EFFECTS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE NEAR TERM AND IN THE FUTURE. NOT HAVING ACCESS OR CONTACT WITH THE WORK WITH THE WORKER CAN BE HARMFUL TO THE CHILDREN SO THE CONTINUED FUNDING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH L. A. COUNTY. AS NECESSARY TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN. ARE WORKERS ARE ALSO WORRIED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IF WE HAVE A REDUCTION IN STAFF. WILL CASELOADS RISE AGAIN WOULD BE HIGH TURNOVER BUT EVEN MORE THAN THAT IS WILL WE HAVE MORE ABUSED AND NEGLECTED CHILDREN THAT ARE PUT AT RISK BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT RECEIVING THE SERVICES. THEY NEED. SO I'LL JUST CONCLUDE THAT THE FUNDING IS NOT ONLY NECESSARY BUT IT'S CRITICAL I'M TO CONTINUE THE INVESTMENTS MADE IN ORDER TO SUPPORT OUR SOCIAL WORKERS. SUPPORT OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND PROVIDE THEM WITH THE CONTINUITY OF SERVICES TO ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IF YOU ACT. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM KATHY SANDERLING MCDONALD EXECUTIVE. DIRECTOR WITH DWTS. THANK MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRTH CAPIZ LIMIT. C. D. WE WERE ASKED TO- SHARED SOME OF OUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE LONG TERM GOALS OF OUR SYSTEM OF CARE FOR YOUTH WITH COMPLEX NEEDS AND ALSO TALK A BIT ABOUT- TRANSITION AND OUR WORKFORCE AS WELL SO ALL TACKLE ALL THREE OF THOSE- THOSE ISSUES FOR YOU NOW. REGARDING THE LONG TERM GOALS OF HOW WE PROVIDE CARE FOR YOUTH WITH THE MOST COMPLEX NEEDS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT A COUPLE THINGS ONE WALKING A FEW WHO WITH THE MOST COMPLEX CARE NEEDS. ARE CERTAINLY NOT THE MAJORITY OF OUR YOUTH ARE THEY ARE SOME OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE MEMBERS SPEND THE MOST TIME WORKING WITH AND SEEKING PLACEMENTS AND SERVICES FOR. AND IN ADDITION THAT THE NEEDS TO SERVE THESE ARE JUST THAT'S RELATIVELY SMALL BUT IMPORTANT POPULATION ARE NOT NEW AND THEY WERE CREATED BY THE C. R. THEY'VE EXISTED FOR YEARS AND HAVE GROWN IN IMPORTANCE AND VISIBILITY OVERTIME. I THINK AS WE UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT THE NEEDS AND- HAVE MORE ATTENTION PAID TO ENSURING THAT WERE. MEETING YOUTH AND FAMILIES NEEDS WITHIN OUR SYSTEM MORE QUICKLY AND MORE THOROUGHLY THAN WE MAY HAVE IN THE PAST. I WILL SAY THAT THE ISSUE WAS ALSO EXACERBATED BY CCR THOUGH IN THE SENSE THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE C. R. AND TO SOME DEGREE ALSO WHAT WE'LL SEE I THINK WITH THE FAMILY FIRST. PREVENTION SERVICE ACT IMPLEMENTATION HAS RESULTED IN FOR BETTER OR WORSE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS WE HAVE FOR YOU THREE NEED OF HIGH END BEHAVIOR HEALTH IN. PARTICULAR TREATMENT SERVICE. SO WHILE WE WERE A- THE THAT WAS PROVIDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE STATE AND WITH OUR COUNTY AGENCY PARTNERS AND SERVICE PARTNERS. TO ENSURE THAT IT'S WELL SPENT AND THAT IS BROUGHT TO BEAR TO- ASSIST AND HELP US. REALLY SURVEYS YOUTH IN A BETTER WAY WHAT WE REALLY THINK OF NEEDED AS A STATEWIDE APPROACH WITH STATE LEADERSHIP TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES. THAT EXIST WITHIN OUR SYSTEM IN LIKE I SAID EXISTED BEFORE CPR I WILL NOW BE FRIGHTENED WITH CCR AND WITH AFFECT PSA- THIS STATE SUBLICENSING STANDARDS ENFORCES THE STANDARDS TO REPLACE SOMETHING OVERSIGHT. AND THAT'S% RATE FOR FOSTER CARE PROVIDERS SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ANALYSIS THAT THE STATE IS WORKING ON REQUIRED BY AB TWENTY EIGHTY THREE. RESULTS IN RECOMMENDATION OF NEW TYPES OF SERVICE PROVIDERS THEIR NEW TYPES OF PLACEMENTS IT'S REALLY SOMETHING THAT WE NEED THAT LEADERSHIP FROM THE STATE. BACKED BY COUNTY IS BACKED BY SERVICE PROVIDERS- BOTH LIKE THE ALLIANCE AND CHRIS AND HER GROUP OF OUR OTHER COUNTY AGENCIES TO REALLY HELP MAKE THAT WORK. BUT WE NEED THE FOREFRONT TO REALLY HELP. CREATE THAT MAKE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND REALLY DRIVE BACK TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN CREATE THAT THEIR SERVICES AND THE NEW PLACEMENTS WE ALSO NEED% ACROSS EACH OF THE CONVERSATION. DHC AT EDS EDUCATION OUR REGIONAL CENTER PARTNERS NOT JUST THE STATE LEVEL REALLY ALL THE TO BE AT THE TABLE IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO REALLY MAKE THIS WORK BECAUSE SO MANY OF. THE YEAR BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- ARE SERVED IN MULTIPLE SYSTEMS THAT I WOULD. I ALSO NEGLECT TO MENTION PROBATION BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT. UNFORTUNATELY. WE DO HAVE YOU TO CRAFT BETWEEN THE SYSTEM. FOR HOME- I'VE BEEN THAT MAY BE TRUE BY A TRUMP EVENT OR REMEMBER A TRUCK DRAMATIC ABOUT THAT OCCURRED. OR NOT RECEIVING SERVICES THAT THEY NEEDED AT THE POINT IN TIME WHEN THEY REALLY NEED OF THAT. CAN CREATE BEHAVIORS THAT- THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN ARE RESULTING IN DAMAGE ARE HARM TO THEMSELVES OR TO OTHERS AND ALL IT TAKES IS ONE PHONE CALL THAT'S WHY WE WORK SO CLOSELY WITH YOUR CHAIR ARAMBULA. TO PUT FIRST AT THE PLACE THAT FAMILY REJECT RESPONSE SYSTEM THAT'S ROLLED OUT THAT STILL YOU KNOW IN ITS INFANCY BUT WE'RE ALREADY SEEING HUNDREDS OF CALLS TO THE HOTLINE. WHERE THESE TRAINED PROFESSIONALS CAN HELP TO DIFFUSE THE SITUATION SO THE CALL THE GO TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OR THE CALL DOESN'T GO TO A SOCIAL WORKER AND SAY COME GET pWANT THEM HERE ANYMORE AND ADD TO THAT SERIES OF A FEELING OF REJECTION AND FAILURE THAT WE KNOW SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE FEEL AND REALLY- INTERNALIZED. AND THAT HAPPENS WITH FURTHER. ALONG WITH THAT- AND SO. A COUPLE THINGS THAT I JUST TO SEE. WERE TO FUNDING THAT WAS FROM IN THE YEAR. FIRST REGARDING THE CHILD. FINDING WE'RE PROPOSING THAT THE PROCESS FOR COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO SPEND THAT FUNDING BE I SWITCHED UP A LITTLE BIT. CURRENTLY THE PROCESS IS THAT THAT COUNTY BUT TO PUT A REQUEST IN THE STATE THAT MUST REVIEW AND APPROVE THE REQUEST AND ONLY AT THAT POINT YOU HAVE THAT COUNTY PROVIDE THOSE. SERVICES WITHOUT FINDING WE REALLY THINK THAT ACCOUNTABILITY IS CRITICAL HERE WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE NO ISSUE WITH ACCOUNTABILITY. BUT WE THINK THAT COUNTY THAT IS HAS A YEAR. WHO WAS IMMEDIATELY AT THAT MOMENT EXPERIENCING INDEED WHICH IS WHAT WE TYPICALLY HEAR ABOUT. SHOULD NOT HAVE TO ASK FOR PERMISSION TO PROVIDE SERVICES THAT YOU'VE EVEN THAT MOMENT AND THEN WAIT FOR APPROVAL WHETHER THAT'S A DAY OR WEEK IT'S STILL. THAT THE STATE NEED IS NOW AND SO WHAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN INSTEAD IS THAT COUNTIES UNDERSTAND WHAT THE FUNDS CAN BE USED FOR. AND THAT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO SPEND THOSE FUNDS PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES FOR THOSE USED AND THEN PROVIDE THE INFORMATION TO THE STATE ON HOW THE FUNDS WERE USED IN FOR HOME AND WHY. SO IT'S AN AFTER THE FACT REPORT RATHER THAN A PERMISSION REQUEST THAT COULD DELAY THE PROVISION OF NEEDED SERVICES WE JUST. WE THINK THIS IS A SORT OF WHATEVER IT TAKES MOMENT EVERYTHING AT THE MOMENT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE WHATEVER IT TAKES SO THAT'S- THAT'S ONE THING- WE ALSO. ARE REVIEWING YOUR HEAD OF WHAT IT IS THAT COUNTIES OF REQUESTED WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN A LOUDER OR QUESTION. I KNOW THAT MOST OF WHAT'S BEEN ASKED FOR HAVE BEEN APPROVED BUT WE THINK THAT IT MAY BE ON THE NEEDED FOR US TO BROADEN. OUR THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT THE WHAT THE FUNDING COULD BE USED FOR SO WE'LL FOLLOW UP WITH. THE STATEMENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE WITH YOUR COMMITTEE AND STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT WE. HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS WE MOVE OUR WORK- AND THEN I JUST SORT OF ONE MORE THING TO IS THAT WE ARE COULD TO MONITOR WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE YOUTH WHO CAME BACK INTO OUR STATE IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE FROM THE OUT OF STATE CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES YOU I'M SURE CALL A BIG TOPIC OF OUR CONVERSATION LAST YEAR WAS THAT- ALL OF THE OTHER THREE CONGREGATE FACILITIES WERE DECERTIFIED AT THE SAME TIME- A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE USED ACROSS CHILD WELFARE OR PROBATION WERE BROUGHT BACK TO CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE BEEN RECEIVING WILL BE UNTIL DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE WERE RECEIVING MONTHLY UPDATES ON THE FIELD AND WE DID SEE SHIPS OVER TIME FROM MANY OF THE YOUTH INITIALLY RETURNING TO RELATIVE PLACEMENTS UNFORTUNATELY THAT DROPPED FROM WAS THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE DECREASE OF A CATEGORY- AND IT LOOKED LIKE IT THOSE YOUTH ENDED UP I'M GOING TO CONGREGATE CARE JUVENILE HALL OBVIOUSLY NOT IDEAL SHELTER FACILITIES YOU KNOW NOT EVERY COUNTY HAS AGAIN ALSO NOT AT A PERMANENT TYPE OF PLACEMENT. FOR UNFORTUNATELY- THEY THEY ARE NOT IN PLACE WE DON'T KNOW THEY RAN AWAY IN SOME WAY AND THAT OBVIOUSLY IS IT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT I MEAN THAT THE CONCERN. I THINK IS THAT- WE DON'T THINK THE YOUTH ARRESTED FOR GETTING WHAT THEY NEED. WE HAVE GIVEN WILL BE WORK WITH TO TRY MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN- WORK TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY PLACEMENT OPTIONS WE APPRECIATE THAT THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. ON THAT IN OUR STATE PARTNERS PROVIDE I THINK AT TIMES- ROLLING UP OUR SLEEVES A LITTLE MORE AND MAYBE- REALLY. HAVING THAT- GO TO A FRUITION OF ACTUAL PLACEMENT IS SOMETHING THAT MAY NOT HAPPEN AS MUCH AS I COUNTIES WOULD LIKE AND SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO DO THAT WORK WITH THE STATE. TO TRY TO ENGAGE IN TA AND ALSO PUSH THE ENVELOPE ON WHAT THAT SHE A INCLUDES I THINK THAT'S OUR JOB AT THAT AT THE COUNTY PARTNERS. THAT AS ALL OF US NOW. ONE THING I GONNA USE TO THE WHO ARE UNANSWERED I MENTIONED OF COURSE THE INDEPENDENT LIVING PROGRAM THAT WE'RE WORKING ON. IN ADDITION- SORRY- MY DOOR ABOUT THIS RIGHT AND NOW I HAVE DOLLARS THE HOPE WE COULD NOT REALLY- WE ALSO ARE WORKING WITH A FAMILY MEMBER COOLEY ON A REQUEST FOR A TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM. FOR MINORS- THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT THE FAMILY FIRST ACTING MAKES. SOME OF THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING OPTIONS THAT WE HAD NO LONGER AT ABLE TO BE FOUND IN A FEDERAL WAY AND SO WE- WANT TO BE ABLE TO COMPLY. WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF FAMILY FIRST SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE THESE FACILITIES AND SO- WE'RE PROPOSING SOME CHANGES TO HOW THAT PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED WE THINK THAT THAT WILL DEFINITELY HELP IT CERTAINLY ADDRESS OF THE ISSUES THAT MATTER WEALTHY PASSED AS WELL. AND THEN FINALLY- WE DO KNOW THAT WE WERE ASKED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE WORK FORCE ISSUES. THAT COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES ARE EXPERIENCING AND AT WHAT POINT DID A REALLY ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AND- I MEAN THAT'S A THAT'S A FANTASTIC QUESTION AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE REALLY. I'M IN A LOT OF PLACES STRUGGLING WITH TO BE QUITE HONEST WITH YOU. IN PARTICULAR- WE ARE WE VALUE TREMENDOUSLY SOCIAL WORKERS- WHO HAVE A MASTERS IN SOCIAL WORK OUR OUR DEGREED SOCIAL WORK PROFESSIONALS ARE A HUGE RESOURCE AND HALF THAT. FOR OUR PROGRAMS AND IN PARTICULAR THESE MASTERS DEGREED. PROFESSIONALS ARE. REALLY CRITICAL NOT TO FROM HIM SERVICES. BUT IN OUR BEHAVIOR HEALTH SYSTEM. AS WELL AS OTHER A- THAT WE WERE WITH AND SO- I FOR. OUR SOCIAL WORK SCHOOLS ARE IMPACTED THEY CAN NOT ALLOW EVERYONE WHO WANTS THAT AND INSTEAD OF YOU AGAIN BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE SPOTS. THAT ARE NECESSARY AND SO WE'RE PARTNERING WITH BE CALIFORNIA'S ASSOCIATION OF DEANS AND DIRECTORS OF THE SOCIAL WORK SCHOOLS AS WELL AS THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS. AND S. YEAH YOU CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL TO PROPOSE A TRUTHFUL ONE WOULD ALLOW- AN INCREASE AND FIVE TO BETTER MEET THAT DEMAND AND THEN THE OTHER PART OF THE PROPOSAL WOULD. SUPPORT FIELD PLACEMENTS THOSE ARE THAT PLACEMENTS THAT THAT OUR STUDENTS DO IN YEARS ONE AND TWO OF THE PROGRAM FOR THEIR ACTUALLY PLACED WITHIN AGENCY THEY SEE HOW IT WORKS ON THE GROUND THEY GET THAT SUPERVISION. AND IT'S A REQUIRED PART OF THEIR WORK AND SO BEING ABLE TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE SUPPORTING OUR SOCIAL WORK SCHOOLS ON BOTH WITH SLOTS AS WELL AS WITH THOSE FIELD PLACEMENT OPPORTUNITY. TO ENABLE THE SOCIAL WORK STUDENTS TO SEE WHAT'S GOING TO BE LIKE WHEN THEY'RE PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES IN A PUBLIC AGENCY WERE HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN RECRUIT MORE TO WORK IN THE PUBLIC AND NONPROFIT SECTORS. AND SUPPORT THEM SO THEY KNOW YOU KNOW KIND OF WHAT THE JOB IS AND IDEALLY WE CAN REDUCE TURNOVER AND BURNOUT WHICH ARE ISSUES THAT WE'RE SEEING IN OUR WORK FORCE JUST AS WE SEE THROUGHOUT SO MANY OF THAT THE WORKFORCE ISSUES THAT WERE SPEAKING TO THE PANDEMIC. ALL RIGHT NOW TO DIFFICULT JOB AND SO- WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL FOR WORKFORCE- OUR GROUP IS MEETING WITH EACH HIGH- SHORTLY I THINK NEXT WEEK TO TALK ABOUT OUR PROPOSAL AND SEE HOW IT CAN. FIT TOGETHER- BUT WERE EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES AND WE THINK IT'S REALLY CRITICAL TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT. OUR SCHOOLS OF SOCIAL WORK THANK YOU THAT CONCLUDES. MY REMARKS HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL IT UP TO THE DÍAS NOW I WILL BEGIN BY- ONE EXPLORE. THANK TREVAN WILKES HIS. WITH THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR YOUTH IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. FOR US TO HAVE PEOPLE WITH LIVED pTHESE TABLES AND- REALLY APPRECIATED YOUR COMMENTS AND- OPTIMISM. OF HOW WE ARE ABLE TO RISE ABOVE THE ADVERSITY THAT WE HAVE SO THAT WE CAN HEAL AND GROW. I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ASK TWO QUESTIONS NOW IF THE ADMINISTRATION IF I COULD FOLLOWING UP ON- SIMONE CORRECT LEASE QUESTION REGARDING THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM. SHE HAD STATED THAT THERE'S NO FUNDING FOR THE SERVICES THAT WE HAVE FOR- THE FOSTER YOUTH WHO ARE IN THE SYSTEM. THAT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND- AFTER IMPLEMENTATION OF CAL AIM- OR THROUGH THE CHILDREN'S AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE WILL WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FUNDING. FOR SERVICES WRAPAROUND SERVICES FOR THIS POPULATION. QUESTION WILL BE FRIENDLY SCHWARTZ IF YOU'RE STILL ON. I'M HERE- IN TERMS OF THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES FOR OUR YOUTH AND OUR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING- THEY SHOULD BE ABLE I THINK THE RECORD THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED WITH CALAMP. CERTAINLY APPLY TO ALL OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE AND SO THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ON THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES AND I THINK THE IMPROVEMENTS AND STREAMLINING THAT WERE MADE IN THE CALLING PROCESS TO HAVE THAT ELIGIBILITY- ESTABLISHED BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT THESE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE IN FOSTER CARE. WELL AID AND NOT SO HOPEFULLY WE ARE REMOVING SOME OF THOSE. HERE'S TO BEING ABLE TO RECEIVE THAT SUPPORT- AND THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES THAT AND THE TURKMENS. I'M I WILL ASK MY FINAL QUESTION AND I'D LIKE TO DRAW A COMPARISON TO OUR- DDS POPULATION THAT FOCUSES ON COMPLEX CARE NEEDS AN OUTREACH AS WELL WITHIN THAT POPULATION WE HAVE BOTH. A STAR AND A CAST TEAM THAT HELP US TO DO SOME OF THE TA AND OUTREACH THAT'S NEEDED WITH COUNTY IS THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK EXPLICITLY WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE A NEED TO PER STRIKE TEAMS. WITHIN OUR CHILD WELFARE SERVICES POPULATION SIMILARLY TO HELP US WITH OUT OF REACH AND WORKING WITH COUNTIES HOPING THE ADMINISTRATION CAN COMMENT ON THAT. AGAIN APOLOGIES.
