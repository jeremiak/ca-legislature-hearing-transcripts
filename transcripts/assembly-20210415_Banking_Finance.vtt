THEY'RE OPERATING OUTSIDE OF

00:53:45.889 --> 00:53:46.923
THE REGULATIONS THAT THAT

00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:48.458
OTHER. COMPANIES WOULD HAVE TO

00:53:48.525 --> 00:53:50.827

AN ATTORNEY AT LAW. IT ALSO

00:53:52.662 --> 00:53:54.831

BE REGULATED JUST LIKE THAT

00:54:16.786 --> 00:54:17.921
FROM THE COMPANY THAT IS IN

00:54:17.988 --> 00:54:19.623
FACT WHAT THEY ARE DOING NOT

00:54:19.689 --> 00:54:21.291
THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE A PUBLIC

REGULATED BY THE FEDERAL TRADE

00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:17.100
COMMISSION- I'M RECOGNIZING

00:57:17.167 --> 00:57:19.202
THAT THAT LEAVES SOME LOOPHOLES

00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:20.970
FOR COMPANIES THAT ARE JUST

00:57:21.037 --> 00:57:22.572

SHORTCOMINGS. OF THIS FTC

00:57:28.311 --> 00:57:30.580
REGULATIONS YET- AND IS THERE

00:57:30.647 --> 00:57:33.149
N OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO MORE

PROTECTIONS WITHOUT CREATING

00:57:43.059 --> 00:57:44.427
KIND OF AT THE PATCHWORK FOR

00:57:44.494 --> 00:57:48.498
SURE THE NAVIGATE. YEAH NO I

00:57:48.565 --> 00:57:49.065
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION- YOU

00:57:49.132 --> 00:57:50.266
KNOW THE SORT OF DAY OLD

00:57:50.333 --> 00:57:51.134
REGULATIONS THAT YOU'RE

00:57:51.201 --> 00:57:53.636
REFERRING TO FTC- THAT DID COME

00:57:53.703 --> 00:57:55.438
IN AND THE OBAMA ERA AS

00:57:55.505 --> 00:57:58.374
MENTIONED BY. BY MARGARET- AS

00:57:58.441 --> 00:57:59.742
YOU MENTIONED NOT ALL THAT SOME

DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES- ARE-

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:04.881
REGULATED UNDER THEM BECAUSE OF

00:58:04.948 --> 00:58:07.817
THE- IN STATE VERSUS INTEREST

00:58:07.884 --> 00:58:09.919

00:58:09.986 --> 00:58:11.354
ADDITION TO THAT MANY ADOPT

00:58:11.421 --> 00:58:13.256
PRACTICES THAT CIRCUMVENT FTC

00:58:13.323 --> 00:58:14.657
PRACTICES AND SO THAT THAT'S

00:58:14.724 --> 00:58:16.125
PART OF THE REASON WHY WE THINK

00:58:16.192 --> 00:58:18.528
THIS IS IMPORTANT IS TO ENSURE

00:58:18.595 --> 00:58:20.330

LOOPHOLES THAT HAVE STARTED TO

00:58:23.299 --> 00:58:26.035
EXIST- I ACTUALLY THINK WE NEED

00:58:26.102 --> 00:58:27.270
TO BE ALIGNED WITH THE FTC

00:58:27.337 --> 00:58:29.172
REGULATIONS I THINK FTC

00:58:29.239 --> 00:58:30.340
REVISIONS HOW WE NEED TO BE

00:58:30.406 --> 00:58:32.508
UPDATED AS WELL- BUT AS WE MOVE

00:58:32.575 --> 00:58:33.576
FORWARD THROUGH THE POLICY

00:58:33.643 --> 00:58:35.144
PROCESS WE'RE CERTAINLY MINDFUL

00:58:35.211 --> 00:58:36.212
OF THAT WE DON'T WANT TO

00:58:36.279 --> 00:58:37.714
CREATE. TO YOUR POINT A

00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:38.815
SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE

00:58:38.882 --> 00:58:40.717
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WHERE

00:58:40.783 --> 00:58:41.584
THE DEATHS OF INDUSTRIES NOT

00:58:41.651 --> 00:58:42.785
ALLOWED TO OPERATE ON CAPTAIN

00:58:42.852 --> 00:58:44.120
CALIFORNIA RIGHT THAT IS

00:58:44.187 --> 00:58:45.455
ACTUALLY NOT THE GOAL AND AS I

00:58:45.521 --> 00:58:47.156
MENTIONED IN MY REMARKS. THERE

00:58:47.223 --> 00:58:48.524
ARE CUTTING MANY OF THESE

00:58:48.591 --> 00:58:49.425
COMPANIES ARE DOING GOOD THINGS

00:58:49.492 --> 00:58:50.593
AND ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE

00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:52.262
SAYING YOU KNOW MANY OF OUR

00:58:52.328 --> 00:58:52.829
CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE NEEDING

00:58:52.896 --> 00:58:54.530
THE SERVICES RIGHT NOW. BUT WE

00:58:54.597 --> 00:58:55.131
ALSO TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING

00:58:55.198 --> 00:58:56.933
SO IN A WAY THAT- THERE ARE BAD

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.201
ACTORS IN THE SPACE RIGHT NOW

00:58:58.268 --> 00:59:00.003
AND THAT WE'RE CREATING-

00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:01.271
REGULATION THAT WILL CLOSE

00:59:01.337 --> 00:59:02.405

ADVERTISING PRACTICES AND

00:59:06.643 --> 00:59:07.410
THINGS OF THAT NATURE TO INSURE

00:59:07.477 --> 00:59:09.012
THAT WHEN CONSUMERS GO INTO

00:59:09.078 --> 00:59:10.146
AGREEMENT WITH THE DEATH OF THE

00:59:10.213 --> 00:59:12.048
