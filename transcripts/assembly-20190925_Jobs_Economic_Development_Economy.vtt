00:25:03.768 --> 00:25:04.302
MANUFACTURING THAT'S GOING TO

00:25:04.369 --> 00:25:06.037
BE KEY CHALLENGE FOR THE REGION.

00:25:06.104 --> 00:25:07.973
NEXT WE NEED TO ACCELERATE THE

00:25:08.039 --> 00:25:08.573
GROWTH OF PROMISING EMERGING

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.810
INDUSTRIES WITH BUT THE

00:25:11.877 --> 00:25:12.410
POTENTIAL OF GROWING A LOT OF

00:25:12.477 --> 00:25:13.745
MIDDLE CLASS JOBS. THIS IS

00:25:13.812 --> 00:25:16.414
ESPECIALLY TO THE RELOCATION OF

WITH THOSE RESEARCHERS THAT ARE

00:25:28.026 --> 00:25:30.061
PART OF CARB. BUT NOW WE'RE

00:25:30.128 --> 00:25:31.730
EXTENDING BEYOND THE TO SEE

00:25:31.796 --> 00:25:32.197
WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF

I'LL TALK ABOUT GREEN KNOWLEDGE

00:25:37.969 --> 00:25:40.105
NON EMISSIONS TESTING. PART

00:25:40.171 --> 00:25:40.639
COULD BE IN CHANGE IN OUR

SHOWS PROMISE OF FINE LITTLE

00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:56.588
MIDDLE CLASS JOBS AND FINALLY

00:25:56.655 --> 00:25:57.756
CYBERSECURITY ESPECIALLY WITH

THE REGION'S RISE TOGETHER. BUT

00:26:53.979 --> 00:26:56.081
AS YOU SEE CIRCLE ONE WHICH IS

00:26:56.147 --> 00:26:59.784
EXPECTING BILLS COACH OUT. BUT

00:26:59.851 --> 00:27:00.452

TACK N. SUSTAINABILITY OTHER

00:27:13.665 --> 00:27:15.533
IMPORTANT SURE THAT IS IT GEN.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.736
ARE CONNECTED TO CARVE AS WELL

00:27:17.802 --> 00:27:18.269
AS OTHER GREEN TECHNOLOGY.

00:27:18.336 --> 00:27:21.573
IMPORTANT RESEARCH ASSETS THE

00:27:21.639 --> 00:27:23.908
UNIVERSITY CAL HI BUT ALSO WITH

00:27:23.975 --> 00:27:25.710
INCUBATORS I'M SORRY GEN.

BETTER CONNECT ON THAT ISSUE.

00:27:27.712 --> 00:27:31.516
CRADLED CAREER ARE SOME OF THIS

00:27:31.583 --> 00:27:33.651
ALREADY IS PART OF IT. BUT IT

00:27:33.718 --> 00:27:39.624
DOES BE UNDER JOB AT THE FOCUS

00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:43.528
OFF. ON A CERTIFICATE AND WAYS.

00:27:43.595 --> 00:27:47.632

WAY THROUGH A CAREER SUCCESS.

00:27:53.772 --> 00:27:54.205
FIVE FOCUSED ON ENEMY IN

PLANNING HONEST PLEA. SURE.

00:27:59.611 --> 00:28:01.946
BOTH LOCAL REGIONAL AND THE

00:28:02.013 --> 00:28:03.782
CONVERSATION ECONOMIC

00:28:03.848 --> 00:28:05.817
DEVELOPMENT NOT I STATED AND IN

00:28:05.884 --> 00:28:07.919
CONJUNCTION WITH SMART THING

00:28:07.986 --> 00:28:08.553
WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING WHEN

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.021
IT COMES TO TRACK PATIENT AS

00:28:10.088 --> 00:28:11.923
WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:14.092
SUSTAINABILITY GREAT TUNE THREE

00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:15.927
AND THIS IS IN THAT K. GORDON

00:28:15.994 --> 00:28:17.996
WHO'S THE HEAD OF OFFICE IN

00:28:18.063 --> 00:28:18.630
PLANNING AND RESEARCH HAS THAT

00:28:18.696 --> 00:28:19.798
AS CAP GROWTH DEVELOPS

00:28:19.864 --> 00:28:20.331
ECONOMICALLY WE NEED TO BE

00:28:20.398 --> 00:28:22.000
SMARTER AND HOW WE DO IT AND

00:28:22.067 --> 00:28:25.904
ESPECIALLY. FOR ME TO BE IN OUR

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:29.641
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION GOALS.

00:28:29.707 --> 00:28:30.308
AND FINALLY IT MIGHT BE STRANGE

00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:32.010
TO SEE A THEME LIKE STRONGER

00:28:32.077 --> 00:28:32.577
NONPROFITS AS WE TALK ABOUT

00:28:32.644 --> 00:28:33.845
INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.

00:28:33.912 --> 00:28:34.379
BUT NONPROFITS ARE SUCH AN

00:28:34.446 --> 00:28:35.880
IMPORTANT PART OF OUR REGION.

00:28:35.947 --> 00:28:36.514
WE TALK ABOUT OUR COLLEGES AND

00:28:36.581 --> 00:28:37.916
UNIVERSITIES WE TALK ABOUT THE

00:28:37.982 --> 00:28:39.684
HEALTH CARE SECTOR. AND ALSO IF

00:28:39.751 --> 00:28:40.151
WE TALK ABOUT SMALLER

00:28:40.218 --> 00:28:40.752
NONPROFITS THAT ARE PROVIDING

00:28:40.819 --> 00:28:41.820
EMPLOYMENT. AND ARE DOING

00:28:41.886 --> 00:28:42.387
IMPORTANT WORK AT ALREADY

00:28:42.454 --> 00:28:42.987
REFERENCED ARE THE WORK OF THE

00:28:43.054 --> 00:28:43.922
SENSES AS ONE IMPORTANT

00:28:43.988 --> 00:28:46.024
EXAMPLE. AND WE HAVE FOR YOUR

00:28:46.091 --> 00:28:47.826
REFERENCE IN IN THE DOCUMENTS

00:28:47.892 --> 00:28:48.460
AVAILABLE TO THE COMMITTEE AS

00:28:48.526 --> 00:28:51.930
WELL AS HERE TODAY. AS LISTING

00:28:51.996 --> 00:28:53.798
A IT'S A PRELIMINARY LIST. WE

00:28:53.865 --> 00:28:55.934
TRY TO FIT AS MANY INITIATIVES

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.902
AS WE CAN INTO TWO PAGES UNDER

00:28:57.969 --> 00:28:59.704
THESE THEMES. BUT THE BOTTOM

00:28:59.771 --> 00:29:02.006
LINE IS THIS. THERE ARE A LOT

00:29:02.073 --> 00:29:02.607
OF INCREDIBLE THINGS HAPPENING

00:29:02.674 --> 00:29:07.946
IN OUR REGION. WE DON'T WANT

00:29:08.012 --> 00:29:08.513
ANYONE'S PITY WE DON'T WANT

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:09.814
ANYONE'S CHARITY WE WANT

00:29:09.881 --> 00:29:10.415
EVERYONE'S INVESTMENT WE WANT

00:29:10.482 --> 00:29:11.015
THEIR ATTENTION. AND THIS IS

00:29:11.082 --> 00:29:12.083
PART OF WHAT INLAND CALIFORNIA

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:16.054
RISING IS TRYING TO DO SO THIS

00:29:16.121 --> 00:29:16.588
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT INLAND

00:29:16.654 --> 00:29:19.991
CALIFORNIA RISING. WHEN WE

00:29:20.058 --> 00:29:22.093
START OUR CENTER A YEAR AND A

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.630
HALF AGO WE INVITED ACTUALLY

00:29:25.697 --> 00:29:27.732
SWEAR ENGINE FORMER MAYOR

00:29:27.799 --> 00:29:28.333
MODERATE REPUBLICAN FROM THE

00:29:28.399 --> 00:29:29.834
CENTRAL VALLEY. WHO IS A

00:29:29.901 --> 00:29:31.836
PRAGMATIST SHE'S NOT

00:29:31.903 --> 00:29:33.905
IDEOLOGICAL. SHE WAS LASER

00:29:33.972 --> 00:29:36.040
FOCUS ON FIGURING OUT HOW CAN

00:29:36.107 --> 00:29:39.577
WE GROW INVESTMENTS IN FRESNO.

00:29:39.644 --> 00:29:40.178
AND TO WORK ACROSS THE AISLE

00:29:40.245 --> 00:29:41.746
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AS

00:29:41.813 --> 00:29:43.548
WELL AS A BROWN ADMINISTRATION.

00:29:43.615 --> 00:29:44.182
ARE TO MAKE SURE THAT ECONOMIC

00:29:44.249 --> 00:29:45.850
BENEFITS CONNECTED TO HIGH

00:29:45.917 --> 00:29:47.852
SPEED RAIL ANOTHER IMPORTANT

00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:49.587
TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS HAD

00:29:49.654 --> 00:29:50.188
FRESNO IS AN IMPORTANT AREA OF

00:29:50.255 --> 00:29:53.892
INVESTMENT. SO WHEN WE STARTED

00:29:53.958 --> 00:29:54.559
OUR CENTER WE WANTED TO FEATURE

00:29:54.626 --> 00:29:57.695
SOMEONE THAT WE COULD. WE COULD

00:29:57.762 --> 00:29:59.831
LOOK AT AS AN EXAMPLE OF COURSE

00:29:59.898 --> 00:30:01.699
WE COULD LOOK TO COASTAL

00:30:01.766 --> 00:30:03.801
CALIFORNIA. BUT SO MUCH OF WHAT

00:30:03.868 --> 00:30:06.037
WE FACE ARE SIMILAR TO WHAT

00:30:06.104 --> 00:30:06.604
OTHERS AN INLAND CALIFORNIA

00:30:06.671 --> 00:30:09.541
FACE. SO WHEN I. FIRST

00:30:09.607 --> 00:30:10.175
PRESENTED AND I STILL USE THIS

00:30:10.241 --> 00:30:11.843
MAP OF CALIFORNIA AND I THE

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:13.845
THOUGHT EXPERIMENT. I SAY IS

00:30:13.912 --> 00:30:16.147
THAT I SOMEONE TO DROP PINS ON

00:30:16.214 --> 00:30:18.183
A MAP IN TERMS OF WHERE IS

00:30:18.249 --> 00:30:18.683
INNOVATION HAPPENING IN

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:21.753
CALIFORNIA WE ASK MOST PEOPLE

00:30:21.819 --> 00:30:24.055
DROP THOSE PLANS. WILL BE A

00:30:24.122 --> 00:30:24.656
WHOLE BUNCH IS A DROP IN THAT

00:30:24.722 --> 00:30:29.794
AREA. I'M A MAYBE MORE SAVVY

00:30:29.861 --> 00:30:30.361
AND KNOW ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT

00:30:30.428 --> 00:30:31.763
TECHNOLOGY MY DROP A WHOLE

00:30:31.829 --> 00:30:33.665
BUNCH OF PENS AND- IN LOS

00:30:33.731 --> 00:30:35.900
ANGELES. OR THEY KNOW ABOUT I

00:30:35.967 --> 00:30:40.038
TECH IT'S AN ATTACK IN IRVINE

00:30:40.104 --> 00:30:40.672
AND SAN DIEGO. THEY'LL DROP ALL

00:30:40.738 --> 00:30:41.639
THOSE PENS THEIR- VERY RARELY

00:30:41.706 --> 00:30:42.173
WILL YOU FIND THE AVERAGE

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.808
CALIFORNIAN DROPPING PENS IN

00:30:43.875 --> 00:30:47.946
INLAND CALIFORNIA. WHEN ASKED

00:30:48.012 --> 00:30:51.950
ABOUT ONLY INVASION IS. THAT'S

00:30:52.016 --> 00:30:52.584
NOT BECAUSE IT IS NOT HAPPENING

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:53.151
BUT THAT'S WHAT OUR DOMINANT

00:30:53.218 --> 00:30:56.254
ENTERED. UNFORTUNATELY MANY OF

00:30:56.321 --> 00:31:00.024
US INTO THIS TRAP ONLY FOCUSING

00:31:00.091 --> 00:31:01.559
ON ALBUMS IN TOWN IS WITHOUT

00:31:01.626 --> 00:31:03.561
TALKING ABOUT WHAT ARE THE GOOD

00:31:03.628 --> 00:31:04.162
PERHAPS WHO'S DOING IT WHO DO

00:31:04.229 --> 00:31:05.663
WE NEED TO INVEST IN. AND

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:07.966
THAT'S WHAT OUR THAT AND PART

00:31:08.032 --> 00:31:08.566
OF OUR DNA FROM THE BEGINNING

00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:09.734
THIS TO CHANGE THAT NARRATIVE.

00:31:09.801 --> 00:31:10.335
TO FOCUS ON THE CHANGE MAKERS

00:31:10.401 --> 00:31:11.936
TO FOCUS ON THE INNOVATORS. AND

00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:14.038
TO REALLY PUSH HARD ON THIS

00:31:14.105 --> 00:31:16.107
NOTION THAT WE NEED TO GROW

00:31:16.174 --> 00:31:16.574
INVESTMENTS AND INLAND

00:31:16.641 --> 00:31:20.144

IN THIS ROOM TODAY LOCAL

00:35:21.986 --> 00:35:22.453
LEADERS FROM SAMBAR DO NOT

COUNTY TO RIVERSIDE COUNTY.

00:35:23.821 --> 00:35:25.690
REPRESENT MANY DIFFERENT AREAS

00:35:25.756 --> 00:35:27.825
I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT ARE THE

00:35:27.892 --> 00:35:29.760
MOST IMPORTANT ACTIONS THAT THE

00:35:29.827 --> 00:35:31.963
INLAND EMPIRE CAN TAKE TO

00:35:32.029 --> 00:35:33.998
SUPPORT A POOR MOBILITY WITHIN

00:35:34.065 --> 00:35:35.800
THIS NEXT YEAR. EXCELLENT

00:35:35.867 --> 00:35:39.670
QUESTION. WELL I THINK WE HAVE

00:35:39.737 --> 00:35:40.238
A LITTLE BIT OF THAT ROADMAP

00:35:40.304 --> 00:35:41.906
ALREADY AS I'VE MENTIONED BUT

00:35:41.973 --> 00:35:43.774
THESE INITIATIVES I THINK THE

00:35:43.841 --> 00:35:45.676
KEY AND THIS IS WHERE. THE

00:35:45.743 --> 00:35:46.210
STATE CAN BE AN IMPORTANT

00:35:46.277 --> 00:35:50.181
PARTNER. WE'RE SAYING THIS FROM

00:35:50.248 --> 00:35:51.916
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WERE

00:35:51.983 --> 00:35:52.383
SAYING THIS FROM THE

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:53.885
LEGISLATURE PEOPLE ARE

00:35:53.951 --> 00:35:54.352
INTERESTED IN REGIONAL

00:35:54.418 --> 00:35:55.987
DEVELOPMENT THEY UNDERSTAND

00:35:56.053 --> 00:35:57.889
THAT IN ORDER TO HAVE A STRONG

00:35:57.955 --> 00:35:58.456
CALIFORNIA YOU NEED TO HAVE

00:35:58.523 --> 00:35:59.790
STRONG REGIONS. THEY ALSO

00:35:59.857 --> 00:36:01.826
UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE'RE GOING

00:36:01.893 --> 00:36:02.293
TO BE TALKING ABOUT A

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.061
CALIFORNIA FOR ALL WHICH IS THE

00:36:04.128 --> 00:36:05.963
HASHTAG AND THEME THAT THE

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:09.700
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS IT IS IT

00:36:09.767 --> 00:36:11.802
IS NOT JUST USING IT'S KEY TO

00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:13.704
THEIR FRAMING OF WHERE

00:36:13.771 --> 00:36:15.806
CALIFORNIANS TO GO. WE CANNOT

00:36:15.873 --> 00:36:17.842
HAVE A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL IF WE

00:36:17.909 --> 00:36:18.409
DON'T HAVE AN IN THE INLAND

00:36:18.476 --> 00:36:21.779
EMPIRE THAT A STRONG. RIGHT

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:22.313
WERE OVER FOUR AND A HALF

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:22.947
MILLION RESIDENTS IN THE NEXT

00:36:23.014 --> 00:36:23.948
CENSUS IS PROBABLY GOING TO

00:36:24.015 --> 00:36:24.515
SHOW AN EVEN GREATER JOB IN

00:36:24.582 --> 00:36:27.852
THOSE NUMBERS. SO THE KEY IS TO.

00:36:27.919 --> 00:36:29.954
HIGHLIGHT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:31.689
BUT I THINK AN IMPORTANT PIECE

00:36:31.756 --> 00:36:34.025
WILL BE TO SEE HOW CAN WE BEST

00:36:34.091 --> 00:36:35.993
LEVERAGE. PUBLIC PUBLIC DOLLARS

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:39.630
TO ENCOURAGE PRIVATE INVESTMENT.

00:36:39.697 --> 00:36:41.632
WE ALSO NEED TRANSFORMATIONAL

00:36:41.699 --> 00:36:43.601
INVESTMENTS IN OUR REGION I'VE

00:36:43.668 --> 00:36:44.135
ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE

00:36:44.201 --> 00:36:45.803
RELOCATION OF CARB THAT WAS A

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.705
SIGNIFICANT HEAD AND HEAVY LEFT

00:36:47.772 --> 00:36:49.840
WHERE WE HAVE PARTNERS

00:36:49.907 --> 00:36:51.609
THROUGHOUT OUR REGION NOT JUST

00:36:51.676 --> 00:36:52.143
IN THE CITY OF RIVERSIDE

00:36:52.209 --> 00:36:54.045
RIVERSIDE COUNTY BUT ALSO IN ST

00:36:54.111 --> 00:36:55.913
REDDING COUNTY SEEING THAT THAT

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:56.547
WOULD BE A GAME CHANGER FOR OUR

00:36:56.614 --> 00:36:59.784
REGION. WE'RE HOPING IS THAT WE

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:01.586
CONTINUE TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT

00:37:01.652 --> 00:37:03.588
AND NOT JUST REST CONTENT. BUT

00:37:03.654 --> 00:37:05.856
THAT BY ITSELF IS GOING TO BE.

00:37:05.923 --> 00:37:07.625
TRANSFORMATIONAL FOR A REGION.

00:37:07.692 --> 00:37:10.061
SO THIS IS WHY FOCUSING ON A

00:37:10.127 --> 00:37:11.963
GREEN TECH CLEAN TECH ECOSYSTEM

00:37:12.029 --> 00:37:13.631
IS GOING TO BE SO IMPORTANT.

00:37:13.698 --> 00:37:15.800
BUT ANOTHER IMPORTANT PIECE IS

00:37:15.866 --> 00:37:16.400
WHAT THAT FUTURE OF LOGISTICS

00:37:16.467 --> 00:37:18.102
IS GONNA LOOK LIKE. WE HAVE

00:37:18.169 --> 00:37:20.137
RESEARCH FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF

00:37:20.204 --> 00:37:22.139
REDLANDS. THE PORTRAYS A PRETTY

00:37:22.206 --> 00:37:24.041
GRIM PICTURE OF WHAT AN

00:37:24.108 --> 00:37:24.709
UNEMPLOYMENT WILL LOOK LIKE IN

00:37:24.775 --> 00:37:26.110
THIS REGION. IF WE DON'T GET

00:37:26.177 --> 00:37:28.112
AHEAD OF WHAT THAT AUTOMATION

00:37:28.179 --> 00:37:28.679
REVOLUTION WHICH IS ALREADY

00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:32.083
UNDER WAY. WHEN IT REACHES ITS

00:37:32.149 --> 00:37:34.018
ADVANCED STAGES WITHIN THE NEXT

00:37:34.085 --> 00:37:34.619
FIVE YEARS WHAT THAT'S GONNA

00:37:34.685 --> 00:37:35.987
MEAN FOR THIS REGION. ECONOMIC

00:37:36.053 --> 00:37:38.222
DIVERSIFICATION IS GOING TO BE

00:37:38.289 --> 00:37:38.856
AN IMPORTANT PART TO MAKE SURE

00:37:38.923 --> 00:37:40.191
THAT WERE RESILIENT. BUT

00:37:40.257 --> 00:37:41.959
THERE'S ALSO IMPORTANT

00:37:42.026 --> 00:37:44.128
INNOVATIONS THAT WE NEED TO DO

00:37:44.195 --> 00:37:44.562
WITHIN OUR WORKFORCE

00:37:44.629 --> 00:37:45.896
DEVELOPMENT. IN LOGISTICS TO

00:37:45.963 --> 00:37:46.464
MAKE SURE THAT WERE PREPARED

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:51.902
FOR THAT EVENTUALITY. AND THEN

00:37:51.969 --> 00:37:52.503
JUST A FOLLOW UP QUESTION YOU

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:54.171
ACTUALLY JUST TOUCHED ON

00:37:54.238 --> 00:37:56.007
PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC

00:37:56.073 --> 00:38:00.044
DOLLARS. AND MY QUESTION TO YOU

00:38:00.111 --> 00:38:02.413
IS HOW CAN THE INLAND EMPIRE

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.649
SUPPORT LOCAL AND REGIONAL

00:38:04.715 --> 00:38:06.183
EFFORTS TO REALLY CATALYZE

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:08.085
CATALYZE PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN

00:38:08.152 --> 00:38:09.954
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND

00:38:10.021 --> 00:38:12.089
HISTORICALLY. UNDER SERVED

00:38:12.156 --> 00:38:15.693
POPULATIONS IN OUR REGION. AND

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.895
THERE'S MANY POCKETS THROUGH

00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:19.930
ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY. NO ONE

00:38:19.997 --> 00:38:22.033

INITIATIVES THAT EACH

00:48:38.348 --> 00:48:39.916
INDIVIDUAL ORGANIZATION IS

00:48:39.983 --> 00:48:41.885
WORKING ON AND NOT JUST KEEPING

00:48:41.952 --> 00:48:43.587
THAT WITHIN YOUR OWN SMALL

00:48:43.654 --> 00:48:44.254
GROUP GOES A VERY LONG WAY AND

00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:47.591
REALLY ELEVATING THE NARRATIVE

00:48:47.658 --> 00:48:48.191
OF WHAT OTHER REGIONAL WHAT

00:48:48.258 --> 00:48:49.793
PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THEMSELVES

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:51.895
AND THEN ALSO WHAT THE REGION

00:48:51.962 --> 00:48:52.496
BEGINS TO THINK ABOUT ITSELF

00:48:52.562 --> 00:48:53.997
AND THEN WHAT. PEOPLE FROM

00:48:54.064 --> 00:48:54.598
OUTSIDE OF THE REGIONAL AWFUL

00:48:54.665 --> 00:49:02.039
THING. AND I THINK ONE OF THE

00:49:02.105 --> 00:49:03.607
OTHER THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN

00:49:03.674 --> 00:49:04.174
ACTUALLY PRIVILEGE TO DO WAS

00:49:04.241 --> 00:49:06.009
HAVE ONE ON ONE DISCUSSIONS

00:49:06.076 --> 00:49:07.844
WITH. PARTICIPANTS SO I REALLY

00:49:07.911 --> 00:49:10.080
WAS ABLE TO GET A BIT MORE

00:49:10.147 --> 00:49:11.715
GRANULAR AND THAT INFORMATION

00:49:11.782 --> 00:49:13.717
ONE THE THINGS THAT HAS ALSO

00:49:13.784 --> 00:49:14.351
COME THAT THAT HAS BEEN VERY

00:49:14.418 --> 00:49:15.952
VERY CLEAR IS THAT. DURING

THESE LISTENING SESSIONS IT'S

00:49:18.055 --> 00:49:18.488

INFORMATION AND WE WERE REALLY

00:49:20.057 --> 00:49:22.159
EXCITED TO DO AND TO SHARE IT

00:49:22.225 --> 00:49:22.693
WITH THE STATE AND WE ARE

00:49:22.759 --> 00:49:24.061
EXCITED ABOUT OUR RULE TO BE

00:49:24.127 --> 00:49:25.796
ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS

00:49:25.862 --> 00:49:27.764
BECAUSE IT REALLY. UNDER IT

00:49:27.831 --> 00:49:29.900
EIGHT IT SERVES THE TRIPLE

00:49:29.966 --> 00:49:31.601
BOTTOM LINE OF WHAT CALIFORNIA

BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND

01:15:36.765 --> 01:15:37.933
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.269
INCREASING BY ABOUT FOUR

01:15:40.335 --> 01:15:40.802
HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE

01:15:40.869 --> 01:15:44.172
THOUSAND FIRMS OR HUNDRED

01:15:44.239 --> 01:15:45.908
ELEVEN CENTS. THAT'S ALSO

01:15:45.974 --> 01:15:48.277

OFFER ALL UP BUSINESSES HOWEVER

01:15:53.949 --> 01:15:56.351

01:15:56.418 --> 01:15:56.852
COMPARED TO THE NATIONAL

01:15:56.919 --> 01:16:00.155
AVERAGE RIGHT NOT INCOME START

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:00.789
LESS REVENUE AND MOST ARE WOMEN

01:16:00.856 --> 01:16:04.226
OWNED BUSINESSES. OF MY

01:16:04.293 --> 01:16:06.061
BUSINESS IS ARE DEFINED AS SOUL

01:16:06.128 --> 01:16:08.430
FIRE SHIPS WITH MORE THAN FOUR.

01:16:08.497 --> 01:16:10.265

01:16:16.138 --> 01:16:20.042
COLLECTING OUT. A BUSINESS IS A

01:16:20.108 --> 01:16:20.642
BUSINESS WITH NO EMPLOYEE AND

01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:21.977
IT. USE LESS THAN FIVE YEARS

01:16:22.044 --> 01:16:28.050
OLD. SO ALL OF THE NUMBERS OF

01:16:28.116 --> 01:16:30.185
LATINO OWNED BUSINESSES ARE

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:32.154
SURGING THE DESPAIR IN THE ACT

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:34.423
AND YOUR NEWS FROM TWIN THEM AT

01:16:34.489 --> 01:16:35.023
OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS ARE

01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:38.293
SIGNIFICANT. SPECIAL WHEN YOU

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.928
COMPARE WITH OUR AVERAGE USE

01:16:39.995 --> 01:16:42.331
FOR WHITE WOMEN BUSINESSES SO

01:16:42.397 --> 01:16:44.032
FOR INSTANCE YOU CAN SEE THAT

01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:46.468
THE BRIDGE I ADDED REVENUES FOR

01:16:46.535 --> 01:16:48.103
THAT THE NOW THIS IS ONE

01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:50.339
THOUSAND. JUST OVER FIFTY

01:16:50.405 --> 01:16:52.107
THOUSAND WHICH WERE WERE WHITE

01:16:52.174 --> 01:16:56.244
IT IS. IT'S TWO HUNDRED AND

01:16:56.311 --> 01:16:56.778
TWELVE THOUSAND. SO THAT'S

01:16:56.845 --> 01:17:02.317
QUITE A- QUITE A BIG DIFFERENCE

01:17:02.384 --> 01:17:02.951
AND WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:17:03.018 --> 01:17:07.990
HOW TO CLOSE THAT. IN FACT LET

01:17:08.056 --> 01:17:09.658
THE OWNED MIKE THIS IS IT IN

01:17:09.725 --> 01:17:10.292

01:17:14.029 --> 01:17:17.699
CORRECT. INDUSTRIES THAT ARE

01:17:17.766 --> 01:17:18.300
THAT GENERATE LESS REVENUE IS

01:17:18.367 --> 01:17:19.735
GENERALLY SO FOR EXAMPLE IN

01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:21.870
HAIR AND NAILS THERE ALSO AS I

01:17:21.937 --> 01:17:24.006
SAID EARLIER THERE TO TEND TO

01:17:24.072 --> 01:17:26.008
BE NEWER AND THEN THE OFTEN

01:17:26.074 --> 01:17:27.709
DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE

01:17:27.776 --> 01:17:29.745
TYPICAL AVENUES OF BUSINESS

BARRIERS AT PLAY. SOONER IN

01:17:39.955 --> 01:17:42.190

01:17:42.257 --> 01:17:42.858
LATINOS BECOME BUSINESS OWNERS

01:17:42.924 --> 01:17:45.694

WHATEVER SO IT'S NOT VERY

01:20:17.979 --> 01:20:18.513
STRATEGIC AND BECAUSE OF THAT

01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:19.915
THEN THE TIME ISSUES ARE EVEN

01:20:19.981 --> 01:20:23.652
EXACERBATED THAT WAY. OF

01:20:23.718 --> 01:20:27.656
LETTING A BUSINESS WOMAN WE

FORTY FEELING. AND THEN IT

01:20:49.811 --> 01:20:51.813
FORMED HOW TO ACCESS CAPITAL

WORKS THESE WOMEN WHO DID KNOW

01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:23.745

OTHER WOMEN THEY WERE BASICALLY

01:21:29.684 --> 01:21:30.252
YOU KNOW THEY'RE IN THE FOCUS

01:21:30.318 --> 01:21:30.819
GROUP GIVEN THIS INFORMATION

01:21:30.885 --> 01:21:31.453
WE'RE TRYING TO GET INFORMATION

01:21:31.519 --> 01:21:32.254
ABOUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO THEM

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:33.688
AND HOW THEY FEEL AND THIS IS

01:21:33.755 --> 01:21:34.322
ACTUALLY A LEARNING OPPORTUNITY

01:21:34.389 --> 01:21:37.692
FOR THEM AS IT TURNS OUT. AND

01:21:37.759 --> 01:21:38.226
MOST OF THESE WOMEN ADDED

01:21:38.293 --> 01:21:39.961
ABSTAINED AFTER EACH OF THE

01:21:40.028 --> 01:21:42.030
FOCUS GROUP BECAUSE THEY ENDED

01:21:42.097 --> 01:21:44.099
UP LEARNING FROM THEIR PEERS

01:21:44.165 --> 01:21:45.867
AND SOMETIMES IT WAS JUST AS A

01:21:45.934 --> 01:21:49.704
SUPPORT GROUP AFTERWARDS JUST

01:21:49.771 --> 01:21:50.238
NOW SHARING SOME OF THEIR

01:21:50.305 --> 01:21:53.842
CONCERNS AND- ALL. SO WHEN THEY

01:21:53.908 --> 01:21:54.476
DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND HELP

01:21:54.542 --> 01:21:56.011
THEY ALSO DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME

01:21:56.077 --> 01:21:57.846
TO TRACK ACROSS TOWN OR SIT

01:21:57.912 --> 01:22:00.115
THROUGH A LONG WORKSHOP THAT.

01:22:00.181 --> 01:22:01.750
THAT OFTEN DIDN'T QUITE MATCH

01:22:01.816 --> 01:22:04.352
THEIR NEEDS. WE HEARD THAT A

01:22:04.419 --> 01:22:05.954
LOT THAT YOU KNOW THIRD THE

01:22:06.021 --> 01:22:06.621
THEY JUST DIDN'T HAVE A DATE TO

01:22:06.688 --> 01:22:10.492
SPEND ON. ONE OR TWO OR THREE

01:22:10.558 --> 01:22:10.992
SESSIONS WHERE THEY WERE

01:22:11.059 --> 01:22:12.127
OVERWHELMED WITH INFORMATION

01:22:12.193 --> 01:22:14.062
THAT DIDN'T QUITE FIT BUT THEY

01:22:14.129 --> 01:22:15.930
WERE LOOKING AT OR WHERE THEIR

01:22:15.997 --> 01:22:16.564
OWN PARTICULAR KNOWLEDGE LEVELS

01:22:16.631 --> 01:22:20.201
WERE. ADDITIONALLY THE

01:22:20.268 --> 01:22:21.770
EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT. JUST

01:22:21.836 --> 01:22:23.905
READ THAT I WAS A WOMAN

01:22:23.972 --> 01:22:24.439
ADDITIONALLY THE EXPRESSED

01:22:24.506 --> 01:22:26.074
CONCERNS ABOUT HOW LITTLE THEY

01:22:26.141 --> 01:22:28.009
UNDERSTOOD ABOUT MARKETING AND

01:22:28.076 --> 01:22:29.911
BRANDING HOW TO SET LONG TERM

01:22:29.978 --> 01:22:31.680
GOALS. USING SOCIAL MEDIA AND

01:22:31.746 --> 01:22:33.715
WHETHER TO OUT SOURCE WHEN

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:34.316
THEY'RE REVENUES WERE LIMITED

01:22:34.382 --> 01:22:37.919
THEY GENERALLY. KNEW THAT THESE

01:22:37.986 --> 01:22:38.553
WERE IMPORTANT THINGS BUT THEY

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.121
JUST REALLY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO

01:22:40.188 --> 01:22:42.023
ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THEM HOW TO

01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:43.858
CARRY THESE OUT. AND IF YOU

01:22:43.925 --> 01:22:45.760
KNOW DO I HAVE THE MONEY I MEAN

01:22:45.827 --> 01:22:47.629
OUTSOURCING IS VERY DIFFICULT

01:22:47.696 --> 01:22:48.263
FOR WOMEN WHO ARE USED TO JUST

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:49.964
DOING EVERYTHING ON A

01:22:50.031 --> 01:22:50.498
SHOESTRING AND DOING IT ON

01:22:50.565 --> 01:22:52.033
THEIR OWN. AND NOW SOMEONE AND

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:54.035
SAY HEY HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT

01:22:54.102 --> 01:22:55.937
SENDING OUT YOUR TAXES. THERE

01:22:56.004 --> 01:22:56.504
THE FIRST THOUGHT AS WELL I

01:22:56.571 --> 01:22:58.039
CAN'T AFFORD THAT. AND AGAIN

01:22:58.106 --> 01:22:58.506
EXACERBATING THE TIME

01:22:58.573 --> 01:23:04.245
CONSTRAINTS. THING TO OUR

01:23:04.312 --> 01:23:05.947
PARTICIPANTS BUSINESS OWNER IS

01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:08.416
OFF LONG AND LEAN MATING AND

01:23:08.483 --> 01:23:08.950
WOMEN ARE FOR MENTORS AND

01:23:09.017 --> 01:23:13.755
PIERCED I'M TO HELP BUILD A

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:14.356
FINANCE FIRE THEM AND COUNTY I

01:23:14.422 --> 01:23:16.091
SALUTE. I CAN'T UNDERSCORE HOW

01:23:16.157 --> 01:23:17.625
IMPORTANT THIS ISSUE WHAT.

01:23:17.692 --> 01:23:19.794
EVERY SINGLE WOMAN CITED IN

01:23:19.861 --> 01:23:22.097
SOME WAY THIS ISSUE AS A PROP A

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:24.165
PROBLEM FOR THEM THAT EVEN WHEN

01:23:24.232 --> 01:23:25.967
THEY ARE OUT THERE ARE GOING

01:23:26.034 --> 01:23:27.802
DOING SOMETHING TAKING RISKS.

01:23:27.869 --> 01:23:29.838
DOING THINGS THAT THEY NEVER

01:23:29.904 --> 01:23:30.505
IMAGINED THEMSELVES DOING IT IS

01:23:30.572 --> 01:23:32.140
STILL AT THE HEART VERY LONELY

01:23:32.207 --> 01:23:35.643
AND THEY REALLY REALLY NEED OF

01:23:35.710 --> 01:23:36.244
PEOPLE TO INSPIRE THEM ROLE

01:23:36.311 --> 01:23:37.879
MODELS PEOPLE TO HOLD THEIR

01:23:37.946 --> 01:23:38.513
HANDS AS THEY ARE GOING THROUGH

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:41.983
THIS. SO OUR PARTICIPANTS

01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:44.085
GENERALLY EVERYONE SAID THAT AT

01:23:44.152 --> 01:23:46.054
THAT BEING A LATINA IS A PLUS

01:23:46.121 --> 01:23:48.356
TO THE SHARED LANGUAGE AND

01:23:48.423 --> 01:23:48.890
CULTURE WITH THEIR CLIENTS

01:23:48.957 --> 01:23:52.193
GIVES THEM. TRACK RETAINING

01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:55.630
THEM. UP THAT'S THERE WERE ALSO

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:56.231
VERY EXPLICIT REFERENCES TO

01:23:56.297 --> 01:23:57.832
DISCRIMINATE AN INSECT SOME

01:23:57.899 --> 01:23:59.634
THAT THEY REGULARLY ENCOUNTER.

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:00.268
SO IN PRACTICE THEY FELT THAT

01:24:00.335 --> 01:24:02.003
THEY HAVE TO WORK HARDER THAN

01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:03.972
THE THAN MAN BUT ALSO HARDER

01:24:04.038 --> 01:24:05.874
THAN WHITE WOMEN TO PROVE

01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:06.374
THEMSELVES COMPETENT AS

01:24:06.441 --> 01:24:07.976
BUSINESS WOMEN. TO GAIN THE

01:24:08.042 --> 01:24:09.744
TRUST OF POTENTIAL CLIENTS AND

01:24:09.811 --> 01:24:12.080
OF THE GATEKEEPERS TO COULD

01:24:12.147 --> 01:24:12.647
OPEN DOORS TO THE RESOURCES

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:15.884
THAT THEY NEED. I LOOKED IN THE

01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:17.886
BUSINESS WOMEN TOLD US THAT

01:24:17.952 --> 01:24:19.921
THEY FACE POLICY AND REGULATORY

01:24:19.988 --> 01:24:21.956
BARRIERS SUCH AS CITY RIGHT

01:24:22.023 --> 01:24:22.457
CHEN SAID FEEL ARE NOT A

01:24:22.524 --> 01:24:27.996
BUSINESS LATE. THEY ARE SELECT

01:24:28.062 --> 01:24:28.630
BEFORE OFFICE AND RETAIL SPACE

01:24:28.696 --> 01:24:30.331
I HAVE EXPRESSED A LOT CERTAIN

01:24:30.398 --> 01:24:33.935
P. ABOUT TAXES FEES OTHER.

01:24:34.002 --> 01:24:36.137
ISSUES UP INTERESTINGLY THOUGH

01:24:36.204 --> 01:24:39.941
ALTHOUGH EVERYONE HAD CONCERN

01:24:40.008 --> 01:24:41.976
IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT. GETTING

01:24:42.043 --> 01:24:43.745
UP TOWARDS YOUR- ARTICULATED

01:24:43.812 --> 01:24:45.814
MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT TAX ISN'T

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:47.882
USED IT WAS MORE LIKE A LIGHT

01:24:47.949 --> 01:24:49.717
THIS IS IT WAS MORE OF THIS

01:24:49.784 --> 01:24:51.719
THIS IS A EXTEND CONCERN AND

01:24:51.786 --> 01:24:55.990
FEAR. MORE. THAN THE SPECIFICS

01:24:56.057 --> 01:24:56.524
ABOUT ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE

01:24:56.591 --> 01:25:04.065
TALKING ABOUT. SO WHY DO THESE

01:25:04.132 --> 01:25:06.201
FINDINGS MATTER WILL CONSIDER

01:25:06.267 --> 01:25:08.169
THAT LATINOS IN CALIFORNIA

01:25:08.236 --> 01:25:10.271
COULD POTENTIALLY AT FIFTY TWO

01:25:10.338 --> 01:25:10.872
THOUSAND YOU THIS IS IF THEY

01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:12.106
CONTINUE GROWING UP RIGHT TO

01:25:12.173 --> 01:25:15.844
HAVE BEEN. IN JANUARY TWO POINT

01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:16.444
SEVEN BILLION FOR THE STATE'S

01:25:16.511 --> 01:25:17.912
ECONOMY. AND IF EVERYTHING

01:25:17.979 --> 01:25:21.850
ABOUT MICHAEL BUSINESS OWNER

01:25:21.916 --> 01:25:22.484
COULD EMPLOY JUST ONE PERSON OR

01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:24.185
JUST ONE PERSON. GOOD CREW

01:25:24.252 --> 01:25:24.752
THREE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND

01:25:24.819 --> 01:25:27.689
NEW JOBS. QUITE A. QUITE

01:25:27.755 --> 01:25:28.256
ACCOMPLISHMENTS WITH JUST A

01:25:28.323 --> 01:25:32.193
LITTLE BIT MORE SUPPORT. IT'S A

01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:34.128
BASED ON OUR FINDINGS WE

01:25:34.195 --> 01:25:35.997
DEVELOP SOME POLICY

01:25:36.064 --> 01:25:36.631
RECOMMENDATIONS TO HELP LET THE

01:25:36.698 --> 01:25:38.199
AS START RUNNING BROKE

01:25:38.266 --> 01:25:41.970
BUSINESSES. I'M IN OVER SEVEN

01:25:42.036 --> 01:25:44.105
LOOTED THESE WOMEN TOLD THAT

01:25:44.172 --> 01:25:45.907
THEY NEED STEP BY STEP GUIDE.

01:25:45.974 --> 01:25:50.011
THAT'S IF POSSIBLE MAN WHOSE

01:25:50.078 --> 01:25:50.545
FIGURATIVELY HOLDING HANDS

01:25:50.612 --> 01:25:52.146
REACH STEP. UGH THERE IS A

01:25:52.213 --> 01:25:53.915
GREATER NEED FOR INDIVIDUALIZED

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:54.549
ASSISTANCE RATHER THAN WORK AND

01:25:54.616 --> 01:25:58.319
SEVEN. TOO MUCH PUBLIC POLICY

01:25:58.386 --> 01:26:00.154
CAN BE BEAR CAN BE BATES AND

01:26:00.221 --> 01:26:02.090
SCALABILITY FOR COST MEASURE IS

01:26:02.156 --> 01:26:04.158
INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED THE HELP

01:26:04.225 --> 01:26:06.127
THROUGH ONE ON ONE THING WITH

01:26:06.194 --> 01:26:08.329
THIS IS THAT. BUSINESS OWNER AT

01:26:08.396 --> 01:26:11.966
THEIR LEVEL. IT'S LESS

01:26:12.033 --> 01:26:12.567
EFFICIENT IT'S MORE CUMBERSOME

01:26:12.634 --> 01:26:15.904
AND CERTAINLY MORE EXPENSE.

01:26:15.970 --> 01:26:17.839
SHIPS WITHIN OVER TO THE

01:26:17.906 --> 01:26:19.674
SCHOOLS AT THE IN A SERVING

01:26:19.741 --> 01:26:20.275

LÀ THEY NEED. AND FINALLY

01:26:26.014 --> 01:26:26.481
WITHOUT BETTER DATA IT'S

01:26:26.548 --> 01:26:27.949
DIFFICULT TO MAKE BETTER POLICY

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:28.616
DECISIONS. OF ACCURATE BUSINESS

01:26:28.683 --> 01:26:30.151
DATA THAT IS GRANULAR ENOUGH

01:26:30.218 --> 01:26:33.555
IT'S HARD TO COME BY. A NEW

01:26:33.621 --> 01:26:34.122
SURVEY FROM THE US CENSUS

01:26:34.188 --> 01:26:37.825
BUREAU IS COMING OUT AND- IT'S

IN THE FIELD NOW AND PROMISES

01:26:38.493 --> 01:26:39.928
TO PROVIDE DATA ON MICRO

BUSINESSES SPECIFICALLY. PRIOR

01:26:43.798 --> 01:26:45.667
PREVIOUSLY I OF THE SAID AT

01:26:45.733 --> 01:26:46.234
THIS POINT IT'S BURIED THERE

01:26:46.301 --> 01:26:47.669
ARE YOU HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT

01:26:47.735 --> 01:26:49.804
VERY COMPLICATED. CALCULATIONS

01:26:49.871 --> 01:26:51.940
TO FIGURE OUT THE NUMBERS AND

01:26:52.006 --> 01:26:53.775
PERCENTAGES OF MICRO BUSINESSES

01:26:53.841 --> 01:26:55.743
AND IT'S JUST NOT GRANULAR IF

01:26:55.810 --> 01:26:56.344
YOU JUST WANT TO LOOK AT THE

01:26:56.411 --> 01:26:58.012
NOW. LET THE IN A MICRO

01:26:58.079 --> 01:26:59.681
BUSINESS OWNERS YOU JUST CAN'T

ORGANIZATION WAS HIRED BY THE

01:36:54.275 --> 01:36:57.745
RUSSIAN. A RIVERSIDE COUNCIL OF

01:36:57.811 --> 01:36:59.713
GOVERNMENTS. TO HELP CREATE.

01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:01.849
AND THEN IMPLEMENT A ROAD MAP.

WE HAVE A WE ARE IN THE EARLY

01:37:13.627 --> 01:37:15.729
STAGES OF THIS WORK WE SPENT

01:37:15.796 --> 01:37:18.132
THE LAST FOUR YEARS FOUR MONTHS

01:37:18.199 --> 01:37:21.569
NOT IF IT SOMETIMES IT'S FELT

01:37:21.635 --> 01:37:22.102
LIKE FOUR YEARS MAINLY FOR

01:37:22.169 --> 01:37:24.038
MUCH. OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

01:37:24.104 --> 01:37:25.973
WHAT'S GOING ON WE'VE MET WITH

01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:27.975
OVER FIFTY OF DIFFERENT

01:37:28.042 --> 01:37:28.542
ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING YOUR

01:37:28.609 --> 01:37:32.079
STAFF. IN I'D LIKE TO SHARE

01:37:32.146 --> 01:37:33.914
FIVE MUCH OF A COUPLE OF OUR

01:37:33.981 --> 01:37:35.883
KEY FINDINGS AND WITH THE

01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:37.551
IMPLICATIONS THOSE FINDINGS

01:37:37.618 --> 01:37:38.185
HALF FOR. OF THE FUTURE OF THIS

01:37:38.252 --> 01:37:43.924
AREA. I LIKE. MATIN CARDIGAN

01:37:43.991 --> 01:37:44.592
RUSH TO THE FOLKS OF SAID THERE

01:37:44.658 --> 01:37:46.093
ARE A LOT OF REALLY GOOD THINGS

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:49.563
HAPPENING A LOT OF REALLY GREAT

01:37:49.630 --> 01:37:50.197
INNOVATION PROGRAMS GOING ON. A

01:37:50.264 --> 01:37:53.701
LOT OF ACTIVITY. ALL THE REGION

01:37:53.767 --> 01:37:57.972
HAS ENJOYED. QUITE A BIT OF

01:37:58.038 --> 01:37:59.773
ECONOMIC SUCCESS. YET IT IS

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:03.911
PRETTY MUCH UNKNOWN. OUTSIDE I

01:38:03.978 --> 01:38:06.046
MEAN IT THE INLAND EMPIRE IS

01:38:06.113 --> 01:38:09.783
KNOWN FOR CONGESTION AND SMOG

01:38:09.850 --> 01:38:11.952
IN TRAFFIC NOT INNOVATION. AND

01:38:12.019 --> 01:38:15.756
THAT IS A HURDLE IN ATTRACTING

01:38:15.823 --> 01:38:19.660
INNOVATORS TO THIS REGION. BUT

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:21.895
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE BIGGEST

01:38:21.962 --> 01:38:25.766
FINDING WAS IT'S LIKE A. A

01:38:25.833 --> 01:38:26.333
TRAIN COMING DOWN THE TRACK

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:27.801
HEADING RIGHT AT US AND IT THIS

01:38:27.868 --> 01:38:29.770
TRAIN IS GOING TO ARRIVE HERE

01:38:29.837 --> 01:38:31.839
JUST AS CERTAINLY AS METRO

01:38:31.905 --> 01:38:33.841
TRAINS ARRIVE IN UNION STATION.

01:38:33.907 --> 01:38:37.611
AND THAT TRAINS COLD AUTOMATION.

01:38:37.678 --> 01:38:39.847
A OF PROFESSOR PROFESSOR MONEY

01:38:39.913 --> 01:38:41.949
IS FROM WRESTLING UNIVERSITY

01:38:42.016 --> 01:38:44.318
HAS DONE A REALLY TERRIFIC.

01:38:44.385 --> 01:38:47.655
PIECE OF RESEARCH THAT PAINTS

01:38:47.721 --> 01:38:49.857
IN VERY STARK TERMS WHAT'S IN

01:38:49.923 --> 01:38:51.558
STORE FOR THIS REGION UNLESS WE

01:38:51.625 --> 01:38:53.727
DO SOMETHING. AND HIS FINDINGS

01:38:53.794 --> 01:38:57.765
INDICATE THAT 63% OF ALL JOBS

01:38:57.831 --> 01:39:00.067
CURRENTLY IN THIS REGION ARE

01:39:00.134 --> 01:39:03.737
VULNERABLE TO AUTOMATION. IN

01:39:03.804 --> 01:39:05.806
THE NEXT TEN TWENTY YEARS. AND

01:39:05.873 --> 01:39:08.142
THAT WOULD MAKE THAT MAKES THIS

01:39:08.208 --> 01:39:09.810
REGION THE FOURTH MOST

01:39:09.877 --> 01:39:10.311
VULNERABLE REGION IN THE

01:39:10.377 --> 01:39:15.783
COUNTRY. FOR AUTOMATION. WHAT

01:39:15.849 --> 01:39:19.753
THAT MEANS IS TODAY THERE ARE

01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:22.089
ROUGHLY NINETY THOUSAND

01:39:22.156 --> 01:39:22.690
UNEMPLOYED FOLKS IN IN MULLIN

01:39:22.756 --> 01:39:36.737
EMPIRE. THAT WOULD GO TO ONE

01:39:36.804 --> 01:39:40.374
POINT TWO MILLION. WHEN TEN TO

01:39:40.441 --> 01:39:41.709
TWENTY YEARS THAT IS IN MY

01:39:41.775 --> 01:39:42.910
ESTIMATION THE SCARIEST THING

01:39:42.976 --> 01:39:43.844
I'VE COME ACROSS IN IN MY TIME

01:39:43.911 --> 01:39:44.445
IN TRYING TO BUILD INNOVATION

01:39:44.511 --> 01:39:47.648
SYSTEMS. SO OUR CONCLUSION IS

01:39:47.715 --> 01:39:49.850
THAT WE NEED A PLAN B. WE NEED

01:39:49.917 --> 01:39:51.952
A STRATEGY TO DEVELOP AND

01:39:52.019 --> 01:39:52.553
INNOVATION DRIVEN ECONOMY THAT

01:39:52.619 --> 01:39:57.891
OVER A PERIOD. TAKE PLACE AND

01:39:57.958 --> 01:39:58.492
REPLACE THE JOBS THAT WE ARE

01:39:58.559 --> 01:39:59.993
GOING TO LOSE THAT WE ARE

01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:02.129
LOSING NOW WE ALL KNOW THAT WE

01:40:02.196 --> 01:40:03.931
SEE THAT EVERY DAY. WE HAVE A

01:40:03.997 --> 01:40:07.801
PLAN TO DO THAT. THAT PLAN IS

01:40:07.868 --> 01:40:11.772
CALLED INNOVATION TWENTY THIRTY.

01:40:11.839 --> 01:40:12.406
IT'S A PLAN IT'S NOT THAT THAT

01:40:12.473 --> 01:40:15.843
IS BUILT ON TAKING AND BUILDING

01:40:15.909 --> 01:40:16.443
INNOVATION HUBS ACROSS THIS

01:40:16.510 --> 01:40:19.747
REGION. NEEDING THEM TOGETHER

01:40:19.813 --> 01:40:21.715
GETTING THEM TO WORK TOGETHER

01:40:21.782 --> 01:40:22.282
TO SHARE RESOURCES THE SHARE

01:40:22.349 --> 01:40:25.819
CUSTOMERS SURE INVESTMENTS YOU

01:40:25.886 --> 01:40:26.420
SHARE OPPORTUNITIES TO SHARE

01:40:26.487 --> 01:40:27.855
BEST PRACTICES. AND TO PUT THAT

01:40:27.921 --> 01:40:31.592
IN PLACE TO BUILD AN ECONOMY

01:40:31.658 --> 01:40:33.727
THAT'S BASED ON INNOVATION THAT

01:40:33.794 --> 01:40:35.929
WILL OUTLAST AND GET AHEAD OF

01:40:35.996 --> 01:40:39.733
THIS AND COMING PROBLEM. WE

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:42.202
SHARE THAT PLAN WITH OVER FIFTY

01:40:42.269 --> 01:40:44.004
ORGANIZATIONS AS I MENTIONED.

01:40:44.071 --> 01:40:47.674
AND WITHOUT EXCEPTION. ALL

01:40:47.741 --> 01:40:49.676
FIFTY THOSE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE

01:40:49.743 --> 01:40:51.712
HAVE EMBRACED ARE PLANT

01:40:51.779 --> 01:40:57.751
INFORMALLY OF COURSE. WHY.

01:40:57.818 --> 01:40:59.586
BECAUSE IT IS THE FIRST PLAN

01:40:59.653 --> 01:41:00.187
BUT NOT ONLY RECOGNIZES THE

01:41:00.254 --> 01:41:02.022
ELEPHANT THAT'S IN THE ROOM

01:41:02.089 --> 01:41:03.857
AUTOMATION AND HAS A VERY

01:41:03.924 --> 01:41:07.761
SPECIFIC PLAN OF ACTION TO

01:41:07.828 --> 01:41:09.596
ADDRESS THAT THAT IS REGION

01:41:09.663 --> 01:41:13.634
WIDE AND I BELIEVE. IT WILL.

01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:15.769
BENEFIT. EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN

01:41:15.836 --> 01:41:17.871
THIS REGION FROM OF COURSE THE

01:41:17.938 --> 01:41:18.439
ENTREPRENEURS TO CREATE THE

01:41:18.505 --> 01:41:19.873
COMPANIES TO THE ACADEMIC

01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:23.577
INSTITUTIONS THAT THAT HELP

01:41:23.644 --> 01:41:25.712
TRAIN RETRAIN OF SKILL THE

01:41:25.779 --> 01:41:29.817
TALENT FOR THOSE. COMPANIES TO

01:41:29.883 --> 01:41:33.787
THE COMMUNITIES IN CITIES THAT

01:41:33.854 --> 01:41:34.354
WILL BENEFIT FROM INCREASED

01:41:34.421 --> 01:41:37.758
TAXES FROM THOSE EFFORTS SO

01:41:37.825 --> 01:41:39.993
THAT WE BELIEVE LONG TERM DEBT

01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:43.864
IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO

01:41:43.931 --> 01:41:45.699
DEVELOP A NEW WAY OF DEVELOPING

01:41:45.766 --> 01:41:49.703
A INNOVATION DRIVEN ECONOMY AND

01:41:49.770 --> 01:41:53.640

TODAY TO TELL YOU WHY WE CHOSE

01:42:21.969 --> 01:42:23.837
TO INVEST. SOME OF OUR

01:42:23.904 --> 01:42:25.739
RESOURCES INTO THE WORK AT FRED

01:42:25.806 --> 01:42:26.306
IS DOING AND WHAT IS SIMPLY

01:42:26.373 --> 01:42:29.743
COMES DOWN TO IS FOR THE PAST

01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:30.344
TWENTY THIRTY YEARS WE'VE HAD

01:42:30.410 --> 01:42:31.612
THE SAME PATTERN OF ECONOMIC

01:42:31.678 --> 01:42:32.212
DEVELOPMENT AND WESTERNERS I

01:42:32.279 --> 01:42:35.616
COUNTY WHICH IS THERE ARE HIGH

01:42:35.682 --> 01:42:36.250
PAYING HIGH SKILL JOBS IN THE

01:42:36.316 --> 01:42:39.586
COAST LOW PAYING LOW SKILL JOBS

01:42:39.653 --> 01:42:40.153
HERE AND EVERY DAY THERE ARE

01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:42.022
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

01:42:42.089 --> 01:42:43.957
WHO GET IN THEIR CARS SOME OF

01:42:44.024 --> 01:42:44.591
WHOM WERE LEAVING AT FOUR FIVE

01:42:44.658 --> 01:42:47.694
IN THE MORNING. THEY'RE DRIVING

01:42:47.761 --> 01:42:49.830
IN TRAFFIC TO GET TO ORANGE

01:42:49.897 --> 01:42:51.665
COUNTY SAN DIEGO AND LA AND

01:42:51.732 --> 01:42:52.299
THEY ARE COMING HOME AT THE END

01:42:52.366 --> 01:42:55.702
OF THE DAY I PERSONALLY DO THAT

01:42:55.769 --> 01:42:56.370
DRIVE FOR OVER TEN YEARS BEFORE

01:42:56.436 --> 01:42:57.738
I RELOCATED MY WORK TO

01:42:57.804 --> 01:42:59.940
RIVERSIDE AND I CAN TELL YOU

01:43:00.007 --> 01:43:01.608
IT'S A SOUL CRUSHING

01:43:01.675 --> 01:43:03.677
EXPERIENCE. AND PEOPLE ARE

01:43:03.744 --> 01:43:04.278
DOING THAT BECAUSE IT'S FUN

01:43:04.344 --> 01:43:05.979
THEY'RE NOT DOING IT BECAUSE

01:43:06.046 --> 01:43:07.781
THEY CAN LISTEN TO PODCASTS ARE

01:43:07.848 --> 01:43:08.448
DOING IT BECAUSE THOSE JOBS ARE

01:43:08.515 --> 01:43:10.083
THERE AND THE JOBS THEY NEED TO

01:43:10.150 --> 01:43:11.852
SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES ARE IN

01:43:11.919 --> 01:43:13.720
THOSE COASTAL REGIONS AND I

01:43:13.787 --> 01:43:14.221
WOULD SAY THAT THIS HAS

01:43:14.288 --> 01:43:17.658
HAPPENED FOR DECADES WE

01:43:17.724 --> 01:43:18.225
COMMISSIONED A STUDY LOOKING

01:43:18.292 --> 01:43:21.762
CUTE PATTERNS. WE FOUND THAT

01:43:21.828 --> 01:43:22.396
THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE IN TWO

01:43:22.462 --> 01:43:23.597
THOUSAND AND WHO DROVE. THE

01:43:23.664 --> 01:43:24.231
COUNTY FOR WORK IS THE SAME AS

01:43:24.298 --> 01:43:27.601
TODAY AND WE'VE SPENT BILLIONS

01:43:27.668 --> 01:43:28.068
OF DOLLARS AS A REGION

01:43:28.135 --> 01:43:29.770
INVESTING IN FREEWAYS INVESTING

01:43:29.836 --> 01:43:30.170
IN TRANSPORTATION

01:43:30.237 --> 01:43:31.905
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT DOES WHAT

01:43:31.972 --> 01:43:33.874
IT BASICALLY GETS PEOPLE TO

01:43:33.941 --> 01:43:35.876
LEAVE THE COUNTY FOR THEIR WORK

01:43:35.943 --> 01:43:37.911
SO THEREFORE WE THINK WE NEED

01:43:37.978 --> 01:43:39.680
TO GO IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION

01:43:39.746 --> 01:43:41.615
AND WITH THE HELP OF EXPERTS

01:43:41.682 --> 01:43:42.249

OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS AROUND

01:43:43.817 --> 01:43:45.919
THE REGION. WE REALLY EMBRACE

01:43:45.986 --> 01:43:47.654
THIS IDEA OF WHAT WE CALL IT A

01:43:47.721 --> 01:43:48.221
NATION BECAUSE AND THE IDEAS

01:43:48.288 --> 01:43:49.957
THAT WE WANT TO CREATE

01:43:50.023 --> 01:43:51.892
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE WHO

01:43:51.959 --> 01:43:55.762

RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THERE ARE

01:49:36.102 --> 01:49:37.737
SO MANY MORE MICRO BUSINESSES

01:49:37.804 --> 01:49:39.572
JUST IN TERMS OF SHEER NUMBER

01:49:39.639 --> 01:49:40.173
AND IT'S INTERESTING IN MY

01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:42.042
RESEARCH THAT THERE ARE A LOT

01:49:42.108 --> 01:49:43.843
MORE FEWER RESOURCES THAT ARE

01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:46.112

BEFORE THE- HOUSING BUBBLE.

02:06:15.701 --> 02:06:16.268

THEY HAD LIVED IN. AND IT

02:06:20.272 --> 02:06:22.041
BECAME APPARENT THAT THE

02:06:22.107 --> 02:06:22.608
CONDITIONS THAT THE WORKERS

02:06:22.675 --> 02:06:25.844
WERE FACING WAS NOT. AN

02:06:25.911 --> 02:06:27.813
ACCIDENT THIS WAS BY DESIGN

02:06:27.880 --> 02:06:28.380
SPECIFICALLY BY SOME OF THE

02:06:28.447 --> 02:06:31.650
LARGEST CORPORATIONS THAT WE

02:06:31.717 --> 02:06:32.251

PRECARIOUS WORKING CONDITIONS.

02:06:39.992 --> 02:06:41.860
THAT OUR COMMUNITY HE WOULD

02:06:41.927 --> 02:06:44.029
HAVE TO STRIVE TO HOLD ON TO

02:06:44.096 --> 02:06:48.067
SURVIVE. THE CONDITIONS THAT I.

02:06:48.133 --> 02:06:50.069
THAT I BEGAN TO NOTE BECAUSE

02:06:50.135 --> 02:06:50.703
WORKERS WALK INTO OUR OFFICE ON

02:06:50.769 --> 02:06:51.737
A DAY TO DAY BASIS WHERE

02:06:51.804 --> 02:06:53.806
PRECARIOUS WORKING

02:06:53.872 --> 02:06:55.741
RELATIONSHIPS IN NATURE.

02:06:55.808 --> 02:06:57.643
DANGEROUS WHERE A HIGH HAZARD

02:06:57.710 --> 02:06:59.945
INDUSTRY SO WORK. FOR THE FIRST

02:07:00.012 --> 02:07:01.847

INTRODUCE AN INDOOR HEAT

02:07:04.516 --> 02:07:06.185
STANDARD. AND THAT TO ME THAT'S

02:07:06.251 --> 02:07:08.053
INSANE. RIGHT THAT WORKERS

02:07:08.120 --> 02:07:10.122
WOULD HAVE TO WORK INSIDE OF AN

02:07:10.189 --> 02:07:11.824

02:07:16.061 --> 02:07:17.896
HUNDRED DEGREES OF HAVING TO

STEEL CONTAINER. WHOSE HE'D

02:07:19.898 --> 02:07:22.167

EXERT PHYSICAL EXHAUSTION AND

02:07:27.773 --> 02:07:29.742
STRAIN ON THEIR BODY. THEN

02:07:29.808 --> 02:07:31.643
HAVING TO GO HOME WITHOUT BEING

02:07:31.710 --> 02:07:32.044
ABLE TO AFFORD AIR

02:07:32.111 --> 02:07:35.647
CONDITIONING. THESE ARE NOT.

02:07:35.714 --> 02:07:37.950
THESE ARE NOT ONE ONE INSTANCE

02:07:38.017 --> 02:07:39.651
THIS WAS THE THIS THIS IS A

02:07:39.718 --> 02:07:41.754
SYSTEM. OF WITH RAMPANT LEGAL

02:07:41.820 --> 02:07:43.655
VIOLATIONS WITH THE CLIMATE

02:07:43.722 --> 02:07:45.758
CRISIS UPON UPON US WHERE

02:07:45.824 --> 02:07:46.325
COMMUNITIES ARE CONSTANTLY

02:07:46.392 --> 02:07:49.728
BEING. CONTINUED TO BE HARMED

02:07:49.795 --> 02:07:50.229
CRIMINALIZING ARE POOR

02:07:50.295 --> 02:07:51.830
COMMUNITIES IMMIGRANT

02:07:51.897 --> 02:07:52.398
COMMUNITIES PEOPLE OF COLOR

02:07:52.464 --> 02:07:53.999
COMMUNITIES. AND SO THE EROSION

02:07:54.066 --> 02:07:57.870
CONTINUES. SO TODAY I HEARD A

02:07:57.936 --> 02:07:59.605
LOT ABOUT HOW BUSINESS ARE CAN

02:07:59.671 --> 02:08:01.974

02:08:21.960 --> 02:08:23.662
INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMUNITY.

02:08:23.729 --> 02:08:25.864
AND SO I BELIEVE THAT THE

02:08:25.931 --> 02:08:27.733
RESPONSE WAS SOMETHING AROUND A

02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:29.902
PUBLIC DOLLARS FOR PRIVATE

02:08:29.968 --> 02:08:31.937
INVESTMENT. BUT THAT CANNOT BE

02:08:32.004 --> 02:08:34.173
WITHOUT DEMANDING STANDARDS ALL

02:08:34.239 --> 02:08:35.808

02:08:58.097 --> 02:08:58.597

02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:03.669
ONE OF HER TECHNIQUES OF

OPPORTUNITIES TO CHILDREN TO GO

02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:09.908
TO DISNEYLAND. BUT ANOTHER

02:09:09.975 --> 02:09:11.910
OPPORTUNITY WOULD BE TO ENSURE

02:09:11.977 --> 02:09:13.912
THAT WE'RE SUPPORTING OF

02:09:13.979 --> 02:09:16.081

THEIR KIDS SO THAT THEY'RE NOT

02:09:27.993 --> 02:09:29.895

02:09:29.962 --> 02:09:31.864
TAKE TIME OFF TO TAKE CARE OF

02:09:56.054 --> 02:09:57.689
WITHOUT TAKING THE COMMUNITY

02:09:57.756 --> 02:09:58.290

02:13:05.677 --> 02:13:09.715
COMMUNITIES HAN. SO WHEN WE'RE

02:13:09.781 --> 02:13:10.282
TALKING ABOUT IMPROVING THE

02:13:10.349 --> 02:13:11.817
REGION'S ECONOMY IT IS CRUCIAL

02:13:11.883 --> 02:13:17.823
THAT. WE REALIZE. THE PROCESS

02:13:17.889 --> 02:13:20.025
IS ALREADY IN PLACE HERE AND SO

02:13:20.092 --> 02:13:20.592
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN

02:13:20.659 --> 02:13:25.931
ABOUT. THE NORTH AB FORTY FIVE

02:13:25.997 --> 02:13:29.835
WE KNOW THAT. IT IS IMPORTANT

02:13:29.901 --> 02:13:30.302
TO BUILD THIS KIND OF

02:13:30.369 --> 02:13:31.903
ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY

02:13:31.970 --> 02:13:35.607
WITHIN CORPORATIONS BECAUSE ON

02:13:35.674 --> 02:13:37.676
A LOT OF THESE WAREHOUSES

02:13:37.743 --> 02:13:38.276
CONTRIBUTE TO THE BALLOONING

02:13:38.343 --> 02:13:39.945
LEVELS OF LOW WAGE AND LOW

02:13:40.011 --> 02:13:41.780
BENEFIT WORK ALREADY AVAILABLE

02:13:41.847 --> 02:13:43.815
HERE AND SO WHAT I HEARD A LOT

02:13:43.882 --> 02:13:45.884
EARLIER WAS PEOPLE TALKING

02:13:45.951 --> 02:13:47.853
ABOUT THE NEXT AND NECESSITY OF

02:13:47.919 --> 02:13:49.821
NOT JUST FOCUSING ON WHAT IS

02:13:49.888 --> 02:13:51.723
BAD OR WHAT IS DAMAGED IN THE

02:13:51.790 --> 02:13:53.658
AREA AND KEEPING OUR MINDS ON

02:13:53.725 --> 02:13:56.094
THE- ON A VISION OF THE FUTURE

02:13:56.161 --> 02:13:58.063
THAT. WE DON'T WE HAVEN'T TAKEN

02:13:58.130 --> 02:14:01.733
THE STEPS TO BUILD YET AND SO I

02:14:01.800 --> 02:14:02.401
AGREE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:14:02.467 --> 02:14:04.002
NOT THINK OF THE REGION AS

02:14:04.069 --> 02:14:06.138
DAMAGED IN ANY WAY BUT ALSO. AS

02:14:06.204 --> 02:14:09.975
EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS REALIZING

02:14:10.041 --> 02:14:11.977
ALL THE WAYS THAT WORKERS HAVE

02:14:12.043 --> 02:14:13.879
BEEN EXPLOITED AND HAVE BEEN.

02:14:13.945 --> 02:14:20.118
PUSH DOWN. I THESE CORPORATIONS

02:14:20.185 --> 02:14:22.120
IN BY THESE BY THE LOGISTICS

02:14:22.187 --> 02:14:25.757
INJURES INDUSTRY SPECIFICALLY.

02:14:25.824 --> 02:14:28.059
SO I THINK ALONG WITH THAT IF

02:14:28.126 --> 02:14:29.995
WE DON'T STOP TO SERIOUSLY

02:14:30.061 --> 02:14:30.595
CONSIDER THAT HISTORY AND HOW

02:14:30.662 --> 02:14:31.963
WORKERS HAVE BEEN EXPLOITED

02:14:32.030 --> 02:14:35.667
THEN WE CAN NEVER FULLY PREPARE

02:14:35.734 --> 02:14:36.234
FOR THE FUTURE FOR ALL THE

02:14:36.301 --> 02:14:39.971
ACCOUNT FOR. WHAT HAS BEEN DONE

02:14:40.038 --> 02:14:41.940
IN THIS AREA AND MY HUSBAND

02:14:42.007 --> 02:14:45.944
ALLOWED TO BE DONE. SO WE'RE

02:14:46.011 --> 02:14:47.746
TALKING ABOUT IMPROVING THE FIT

02:14:47.813 --> 02:14:49.714
THE REGION'S ECONOMY IT'S

02:14:49.781 --> 02:14:51.917
CRUCIAL THAT WE HAVE WORKERS ON

02:14:51.983 --> 02:14:53.618
BOARD IN THE CONVERSATIONS.

02:14:53.685 --> 02:14:55.620
LEADING THE CONVERSATIONS

02:14:55.687 --> 02:14:57.622
BECAUSE THESE ARE THE PEOPLE

02:14:57.689 --> 02:14:58.089
THAT ARE POWERING THE

02:14:58.156 --> 02:14:59.991
INDUSTRIES THAT. NOW MAKE UP SO

02:15:00.058 --> 02:15:01.793
MUCH OF OUR REGION'S COMMERCE

02:15:01.860 --> 02:15:03.862
AND ECONOMY. AND SO MOVING

02:15:03.929 --> 02:15:05.997
FORWARD I THINK THAT. MOVING

02:15:06.064 --> 02:15:09.801
FORWARD ON THE BEST. PLAN TO

02:15:09.868 --> 02:15:11.670
IMPROVE THE REGION'S ECONOMY IN

02:15:11.736 --> 02:15:13.972
THE FUTURE I HOPE THAT THIS IS

02:15:14.039 --> 02:15:15.707
SOMETHING THAT WE REMEMBER THAT

02:15:15.774 --> 02:15:17.876
THE WORKERS. ARE THE PEOPLE

02:15:17.943 --> 02:15:19.845
THAT ULTIMATELY. POWER THESE

02:15:19.911 --> 02:15:22.080
REGIONS AND HAVE TO DEAL WITH

02:15:22.147 --> 02:15:25.617
THE BRUNT OF THE WORK AND SO

02:15:25.684 --> 02:15:26.218
NOTHING CAN BE DONE WITHOUT

02:15:26.284 --> 02:15:28.053
HAVING THEM ON BOARD AND HAVING

02:15:28.119 --> 02:15:29.688

02:15:29.754 --> 02:15:31.756
AND THINKING OF THE SOLUTIONS

02:15:31.823 --> 02:15:32.424
THAT WE NEED TO FOLLOW IN ORDER
