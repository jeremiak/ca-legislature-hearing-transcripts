AS WRITTEN THE BILL

00:30:59.424 --> 00:31:00.558

ALTERNATE SET OF STANDARDS FOR

00:47:20.571 --> 00:47:21.939
THERE IS A DISCONNECT AND

00:47:22.005 --> 00:47:23.640
SENDING A LETTER BUT OUR HAVE

00:47:23.707 --> 00:47:25.309

00:47:31.215 --> 00:47:32.349
CONCERNS HERE TODAY.

00:47:32.416 --> 00:47:34.084
THE FIRST IS THERE'S NO QUESTION

00:47:34.151 --> 00:47:35.852
A MISS PORTANTINO IS PASSIONATE

00:47:35.919 --> 00:47:38.455
ABOUT -- FOSTER CARE PLACEMENTS

00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:39.323
AND WE AGREE WITH HIM THAT WE

00:47:39.389 --> 00:47:41.358
NEED. TO ACHIEVE BETTER OUTCOMES

00:47:41.425 --> 00:47:44.828
THERE AND WE LOVE TO FIND A

00:47:44.895 --> 00:47:45.462
SYSTEM THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO DO

00:47:45.529 --> 00:47:45.929
THAT.

00:47:45.996 --> 00:47:46.730
WE DON'T THINK THIS BILL IS THE

00:47:46.797 --> 00:47:48.365
SYSTEM TO DO THAT I THINK NOT

00:47:48.432 --> 00:47:50.267
ONLY DOES IT HAVE THE UNINTENDED

00:47:50.334 --> 00:47:52.502
CONSEQUENCE OF REDUCING PLANNING

00:47:52.569 --> 00:47:54.304
FOR HOUSING.

00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:56.273
FOR LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:59.276
GENERALLY -- BY REDUCING THE

00:47:59.343 --> 00:48:01.144
CITY'S OBLIGATION TO PLAN BY

00:48:01.211 --> 00:48:02.446
REDUCING ARENA.

00:48:02.512 --> 00:48:04.381
BUT IT ALSO AND SOME OF THIS IS

00:48:04.448 --> 00:48:07.017
ALSO NOTED BY AT THE END OF THE

00:48:07.084 --> 00:48:09.186
ANALYSIS IS JUST A LOT OF

00:48:09.253 --> 00:48:10.787
INCONGRUENT.

00:48:10.854 --> 00:48:12.356
ARE ELEMENTS TO THIS BILL

00:48:12.422 --> 00:48:13.523
INCIDENTS DON'T SEEM TO BE

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:14.591
CORRECT WHAT IT WHAT ABOUT A

00:48:14.658 --> 00:48:16.927
CITY PUTTING THAT PROGRAM

00:48:16.994 --> 00:48:18.562
TOGETHER INCENTIVIZE IS A A

00:48:18.629 --> 00:48:19.563
POTENTIAL FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:22.299
TO TAKE ON THAT RESPONSIBILITY.

00:48:22.366 --> 00:48:23.734
ASSEMBLY BECAUSE THE CITY WOULD

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.202
GET ARENA REDUCTION THAT'S NOT

00:48:25.269 --> 00:48:27.004
CLEAR TO AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:28.438
A FUNCTION THAT IS PRIMARILY

00:48:28.505 --> 00:48:29.906
CARRIED OUT BY THE COUNTIES.

00:48:29.973 --> 00:48:31.375
THAT WERE GIVING CREDIT TO THE

00:48:31.441 --> 00:48:33.510
SET TO A CITY TO DO.

00:48:33.577 --> 00:48:35.412
WE'RE ASKING A CD COGS IN KNOW.

00:48:35.479 --> 00:48:37.114
LITTLE ABOUT THE SUBJECT TO MAKE

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:39.116
AN ASSESSMENT SO ALL OF THOSE

00:48:39.182 --> 00:48:40.350
SEE MIKE IN THE END OF THE DAY

00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:43.053
WON'T REALLY ACHIEVE THE

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:43.987
INTENDED.

00:48:44.054 --> 00:48:45.088
IMPACT BUT IT WILL POTENTIALLY

00:48:45.155 --> 00:48:46.623
LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN OUR

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:48.325
PLANNING OBLIGATIONS AND FOR

00:48:48.392 --> 00:48:50.227
THOSE REASONS GIVEN OUR OUR

00:48:50.294 --> 00:48:51.762
INCREDIBLE HOUSING CRISIS WE

00:48:51.828 --> 00:48:53.497
WOULD JUST CONTINUE TO OPPOSE

00:48:53.563 --> 00:48:54.431
THIS BILL AND HOPE THAT WE CAN

00:48:54.498 --> 00:48:55.465
WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO FIND A

00:48:55.532 --> 00:48:56.867
SOLUTION THAT WOULD ACTUALLY

00:48:56.933 --> 00:48:57.934
ACHIEVE HIS GOALS.

00:48:58.001 --> 00:48:58.502
AND FOR THOSE REASONS REMAIN

00:48:58.568 --> 00:48:59.936
OPPOSED.

00:49:00.003 --> 00:49:01.538
THANK YOU FOR TESTIMONY OTHERS

00:49:01.605 --> 00:49:05.909
AN OPPOSITION SB.

00:49:05.976 --> 00:49:06.476
SIX NINETY FIVE SIGNAL TAKE

00:49:06.543 --> 00:49:10.414
ABOUT TWO OR SENATOR BILL

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:10.714
[inaudible]

00:49:10.781 --> 00:49:16.386
OKAY -- I BELIEVE IF A CITY

00:49:16.453 --> 00:49:16.687
[inaudible]

00:49:16.753 --> 00:49:20.123
GIVES FUNDS TO A GROUP HOME FOR

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:21.958
FOSTER USE.

00:49:22.025 --> 00:49:24.194
THAT WOULD QUALIFY TO MEET THE

00:49:24.261 --> 00:49:26.296
RANGE -- OBLIGATIONS IT SEEMS

00:49:26.363 --> 00:49:27.798
RATHER INCONGRUOUS THAT THE

00:49:27.864 --> 00:49:28.765
STATE.

00:49:28.832 --> 00:49:31.802
IS ADVOCATING REDUCING.

00:49:31.868 --> 00:49:33.270
THE AMOUNT OF FOSTER USE IN

00:49:33.337 --> 00:49:35.739
GROUP HOMES.

00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:38.842
AND ALLOWING THE READ A THE

00:49:38.909 --> 00:49:41.078
REASON HOUSING ALLOCATION TO BE

00:49:41.144 --> 00:49:43.680
COUNTED IF THEY GIVE MONEY TO A

00:49:43.747 --> 00:49:47.584
A GROUP HOME -- BUT NOT A FAMILY

00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:49.853
FOSTER CARE HOME.

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.054
SO I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING

00:49:51.121 --> 00:49:53.156
WRONG WITH THAT ARE WE ADOPTED A

00:49:53.223 --> 00:49:58.128
LAW -- THANKS -- SOME WOMEN

00:49:58.195 --> 00:50:01.264
STONE HAD IT TO DO A REFORM OF

00:50:01.331 --> 00:50:02.599
THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM TO

00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:03.800
ENCOURAGE.

00:50:03.867 --> 00:50:06.069
KIDS -- TO RE GET OUT OF GROUP

00:50:06.136 --> 00:50:07.804
HOMES.

00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:09.573
OKAY THAT WAS THAT IS NOW SET

00:50:09.639 --> 00:50:11.308
THE STATE POLICY.

00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:12.542
WE WANT WE WANT TO FOSTER YOU

00:50:12.609 --> 00:50:16.012
HAVE TO GO INTO FAMILY HOMES OR

00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:17.981
TO LIVE IN A AND TRANSITIONAL

00:50:18.048 --> 00:50:19.282
HOUSING ONCE THEY REACHED.

00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:20.884
ONCE THEY TURN EIGHTEEN SO

00:50:20.951 --> 00:50:23.453
THAT'S THE THAT'S A POLICY.

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:24.921
SO IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY STRANGE

00:50:24.988 --> 00:50:26.723
THAT [inaudible]

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:28.692
WE CAN [inaudible]

00:50:28.759 --> 00:50:31.962
SUPPORT [inaudible]

00:50:32.028 --> 00:50:36.733
VOUCHERS OR KIND OF A PROGRAM

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.635
FOR SUPPORTING GROUP HOMES I

00:50:38.702 --> 00:50:40.170
KNOW THAT GROUP HOMES HAVE

00:50:40.237 --> 00:50:42.105
CLOSED.

00:50:42.172 --> 00:50:43.974
ALL OVER THE STATE IT'S A THE

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:45.542
pBIG PROBLEM RIGHT NOW.

00:50:45.609 --> 00:50:47.411
THERE'S THERE'S GROUP HOMES

00:50:47.477 --> 00:50:50.714
CLOSING AND THE GROUP HOMES ARE

00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:51.815
GOING OUT OF BUSINESS SO THEY

00:50:51.882 --> 00:50:52.215
NEED.

00:50:52.282 --> 00:50:53.650
THE TO HAVE THEY NEED TO RECRUIT

00:50:53.717 --> 00:50:55.419
MORE FAMILIES.

00:50:55.485 --> 00:50:57.487
AND I THINK THIS IS MAYBE  WAY

00:50:57.554 --> 00:50:59.790
A LOANS OF A MORTGAGE ASSISTANCE

00:50:59.856 --> 00:51:02.025
OR SOME OTHER KINDS OF SUPPORT

00:51:02.092 --> 00:51:04.194
SYSTEM. FOR FOR OUR FOSTER

00:51:04.261 --> 00:51:05.695
FAMILIES COULD BE DEVELOPED THAT

00:51:05.762 --> 00:51:08.665
WOULD -- BO A WIN WIN FOR THE

00:51:08.732 --> 00:51:10.534
FOSTER CARE BUT ALSO TO PROVIDE

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:13.136
HOUSING. FOR FOSTER YOU NEED TO

00:51:13.203 --> 00:51:14.604
HAVE THE HOUSING SO.

00:51:14.671 --> 00:51:16.973
I WILL MAKE A MOTION FOR THE

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.809
BILL ON THAT BASIS -- MAYBE

00:51:18.875 --> 00:51:21.378
THERE'S SOME ISSUES THAT CENTER

00:51:21.445 --> 00:51:22.846
PORTANTINO NEEDS TO WORK OUT.

00:51:22.913 --> 00:51:25.048
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO SUPPORT

00:51:25.115 --> 00:51:30.120
FAMILY FOSTER CARE -- A I WAS

00:51:30.187 --> 00:51:32.422

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:43.867
SUBJECT.

00:51:43.934 --> 00:51:45.702
HOW?

00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:50.073
THERE'S SIMILARLY A BUREAUCRATIC.

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:51.475
TENNESSEE TO SUPPORT

00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:53.276
ORGANIZATIONAL GROUP HOMES BUT

00:51:53.343 --> 00:51:56.046
NOT FOSTER FAMILY HOMES.

WITH OUR STATE POLICY WE SUPPORT.

00:52:04.721 --> 00:52:08.058
FAMILY ORIENTED FOSTER CARE.

00:52:08.124 --> 00:52:09.359
SO I SUPPORT THE BILL I LIKE

MOTION.

00:52:10.126 --> 00:52:11.261
CAN YOU CENTER BUILT IN THE FOR

00:52:11.328 --> 00:52:13.296
COMMENTS.

00:52:13.363 --> 00:52:15.499
SENATOR PAN.

00:52:15.565 --> 00:52:16.633
THANK YOU IT SHOULD IT.

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:17.300
I GUESS I AM STILL LOOKING VIEWS

00:52:17.367 --> 00:52:18.935
ABOUT HOW THE MECHANISM WOULD

00:52:19.002 --> 00:52:21.104
WORK SO YOU CAN EXPLAIN SO WHAT

00:52:21.171 --> 00:52:23.106
HAPPENS SO CITY WHICH HAS TO

00:52:23.173 --> 00:52:24.441
HAVE ARENA.

00:52:24.508 --> 00:52:26.610
HOW WOULD THEY CLAIM THE 5%

00:52:26.676 --> 00:52:28.245
CREDIT SO LET ME WALK YOU

00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:30.146

THAT TO HAVE THE OPTION?

00:52:31.581 --> 00:52:33.283
SO RIGHT NOW WHEN THE CITY

00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:35.085
PRESENTED HOUSING ELEMENT IT HAS

00:52:35.151 --> 00:52:37.087
TO SHOW PLANNED FOR AFFORDABLE

00:52:37.153 --> 00:52:38.889
HOUSING DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO

00:52:38.955 --> 00:52:39.923
BUILD THE PHONE ABOUT.

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:42.325
HAS TO SHOW THAT THAT THERE'S A

00:52:42.392 --> 00:52:42.893
PLAN RIGHT.

00:52:42.959 --> 00:52:46.263
AND SO THIS BILL WOULD ONLY.

00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:48.431
APPLY TO CITIES THAT HAVE A

00:52:48.498 --> 00:52:50.267
CURRENT HOUSING ELEMENT THAT TO

00:52:50.333 --> 00:52:51.735
ALREADY APPROVED SO IF YOU'RE A

00:52:51.801 --> 00:52:53.203
BAD CITY THAT DOESN'T HAVE A

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:54.404
HOUSING ELEMENT.

00:52:54.471 --> 00:52:56.339

WITH THE APPROVED PLAN NUMBER.

00:53:03.013 --> 00:53:04.247
TWO DURING THE TIME BEFORE YOUR

00:53:04.314 --> 00:53:06.716
NEXT PLAN IS APPROVED.

00:53:06.783 --> 00:53:08.585
UNLIKE THE ORIGINAL PLAN WHICH

00:53:08.652 --> 00:53:10.654
IS HAS TO SHOW THAT YOU CAN PLAN

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.821
FOR HOUSING.

00:53:11.888 --> 00:53:14.991
IF YOU ACTUALLY PLACE.

00:53:15.058 --> 00:53:16.159
FOSTER YOU.

00:53:16.226 --> 00:53:18.895
IN SINGLE FAMILY HOMES.

00:53:18.962 --> 00:53:21.898
UP 25% OF THAT CAN BE COUNTED

00:53:21.965 --> 00:53:24.401
FOR YOUR RENO OBLIGATION WHEN

00:53:24.467 --> 00:53:25.869
YOU GO TO RENEW YOUR NEXT POINT.

00:53:25.936 --> 00:53:27.971
NOT A THEORETICAL PLAN FOR

00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:30.740
PLACING KIDS BUT UP BUT THE THE

00:53:30.807 --> 00:53:32.475
IDEAS THAT THIS.

00:53:32.542 --> 00:53:34.678
A CHURCH A QANTAS CLUB A PROGRAM

00:53:34.744 --> 00:53:36.513
WITHIN A CITY WOULD COME UP AND

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:37.881
SAY YOU KNOW WHAT LET'S.

00:53:37.948 --> 00:53:40.584
INCENTIVIZE OUR CONGREGATE IN

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:42.085
OUR OUR COMMUNITY TO PLACE KIDS

00:53:42.152 --> 00:53:43.153
IN THESE MONIES AYE BUT I JUST

00:53:43.219 --> 00:53:45.455
WANT TO CLARIFY THAT.

00:53:45.522 --> 00:53:48.258
DETAIL SO [inaudible] FOR EVERY

00:53:48.325 --> 00:53:50.961
CHILD EVERY FOSTER CHILD WHOSE

00:53:51.027 --> 00:53:53.229
PLACE.

00:53:53.296 --> 00:53:55.465
IN THE IN A HOLLOW IN A HOME IN

00:53:55.532 --> 00:53:57.567
THE LIMITS OF THE CITY HE LANDED

00:53:57.634 --> 00:53:58.401
IN THEIR CITY.

00:53:58.468 --> 00:53:59.703
IN THAT PARTICULAR CITY WOULD

00:53:59.769 --> 00:54:01.237
CALENDAR THE JURISDICTION OF

00:54:01.304 --> 00:54:02.973
THAT HOUSING ELEMENT.

00:54:03.039 --> 00:54:06.309
UP 25% SO BUT SO EACH PLACED

00:54:06.376 --> 00:54:07.944
WOULD COUNT AS ONE HOUSE RIGHT

00:54:08.011 --> 00:54:09.779
SO IF YOU HAD A HUNDRED K. IF

00:54:09.846 --> 00:54:11.247
YOU HAD AN OBLIGATION OF EIGHT

00:54:11.314 --> 00:54:13.350
HUNDRED OKAY IF YOU PLACED FIVE

00:54:13.416 --> 00:54:15.485
CHILDREN IN FIVE HOMES SO LET ME

00:54:15.552 --> 00:54:18.722
JUST ASK ANOTHER QUESTION AND SO.

00:54:18.788 --> 00:54:20.256
CITIES COME IN DIFFERENT SIZES

00:54:20.323 --> 00:54:21.625
RIGHT SUMMER SMALL SOME ARE

00:54:21.691 --> 00:54:22.826
LARGER.

00:54:22.892 --> 00:54:24.694
I THINK ONE OF OUR PRIORITIES IS

00:54:24.761 --> 00:54:26.463
TO BE SURE WE PLACE A FOSTER

00:54:26.529 --> 00:54:28.999
YOUTH IN THE RIGHT HOME I MEAN

00:54:29.065 --> 00:54:30.266
WE TALK ABOUT PRIORITIES IN

00:54:30.333 --> 00:54:32.135
TERMS OF FAMILIES ETCETERA.

00:54:32.202 --> 00:54:34.671
SO THEY GET SO AT A WALTERS

00:54:34.738 --> 00:54:35.472
EIGHT A CHILD IS PLACED IN THE

00:54:35.538 --> 00:54:38.208
FOSTER CARE SYSTEM IN ONE CITY.

00:54:38.274 --> 00:54:40.710
GETS PLACE WITH A RELATIVE ARE

00:54:40.777 --> 00:54:43.146
IN ANOTHER CITY.

00:54:43.213 --> 00:54:44.180
WHICH CITY GETS THE CREDIT.

00:54:44.247 --> 00:54:50.353
THE CITY THAT'S ABILITY.

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:52.155
OF CURRENT EXISTENCE SO.

00:54:52.222 --> 00:54:53.189
HOW DO YOU STRUCTURE STILL TO

00:54:53.256 --> 00:54:54.524
RIGHT ALL WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE

00:54:54.591 --> 00:54:56.426
HELPING AUGMENT THE COUNTIES

00:54:56.493 --> 00:54:58.895
EFFORTS TO FIND NEW HOMES?

00:54:58.962 --> 00:55:02.032
BY INCENTIVIZING A CITY COUNCIL

00:55:02.098 --> 00:55:03.600
VOLUNTARY PROGRAM DESIGNED TO

00:55:03.667 --> 00:55:04.234

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:08.905
SITUATION EXPLAIN IT'S THE CITY.

00:55:08.972 --> 00:55:11.241
IN WHICH THE THAT CREATES A

00:55:11.307 --> 00:55:13.076
PROBLEM THAT THAT THAT PLATE AND

00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:14.277
WHICH IS PLACE SO THIS THAT THEY

00:55:14.344 --> 00:55:16.179
HAVE A YOUTH.

00:55:16.246 --> 00:55:16.780
NOW THEY WERE WITH ONE FAMILY

00:55:16.846 --> 00:55:17.981
MEMBER DAY GOT PLACED IN FOSTER

00:55:18.048 --> 00:55:18.481
CARE BECAUSE OF WHATEVER

00:55:18.548 --> 00:55:19.683
CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:55:19.749 --> 00:55:22.352
RIGHT AND THEN TURNS OUT YEAH

00:55:22.419 --> 00:55:24.721
COUNTY SOCIAL WORKER I THE THE

00:55:24.788 --> 00:55:26.523
SOCIAL WORKER AND A STEP BY THE

00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:28.992
BEST POSSIBLE PLACEMENT IS IN

00:55:29.059 --> 00:55:30.694
ANOTHER CITY.

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:32.896
THE SUNNIS IN CALIFORNIA THAN --

00:55:32.962 --> 00:55:34.597
THAN THAT CITY THAT THAT FAST

00:55:34.664 --> 00:55:36.533
YOU THIS PLACE THEN IS THE ONE

00:55:36.599 --> 00:55:39.035
WHO QUOTE GETS THE CREDIT RIGHT

00:55:39.102 --> 00:55:40.704
AGAINST THEIR ARENA BY BECAUSE

00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:42.172
THEY'RE CREATING A NEW HOME.

00:55:42.238 --> 00:55:44.140
OKAY THE IDEA IS TO CREATE A NEW

00:55:44.207 --> 00:55:46.242
FOSTER.

00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:47.510

00:55:50.847 --> 00:55:53.516
CITY IT'S SELF NEED TO DO I MEAN

00:55:53.583 --> 00:55:55.685
IDEALLY I THINK YOU TRY COURAGE

00:55:55.752 --> 00:55:56.820
CITIES.

00:55:56.886 --> 00:55:57.687
THE REST IS FIVE ALA TERRY BUT

00:55:57.754 --> 00:55:59.422
BUT I MEAN IT COULD BE THAT JUST

00:55:59.489 --> 00:56:00.724
PASSIVELY THIS.

00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:01.491
THE SERBS THEIR NUMBER WILL

00:56:01.558 --> 00:56:03.259
HAPPEN RIGHT JUST BECAUSE THE

00:56:03.326 --> 00:56:04.561
COUNTIES WORKING TO PLACE THESE

00:56:04.627 --> 00:56:09.199

00:56:11.735 --> 00:56:13.536
OF OPPORTUNITIES NOW I KNOW AND

00:56:13.603 --> 00:56:14.971

HAVE VERY LIMITED NUMBER OF FOSS

00:56:20.043 --> 00:56:21.711
AND THAT'S THE OTHER PART OF

00:56:21.778 --> 00:56:23.413
THIS IS TRYING TO CREATE.

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:25.615
SORT OF NONTRADITIONAL.

00:56:25.682 --> 00:56:27.484
PLACEMENTS IN IN HOMES THAT

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:29.152
WOULD NORMALLY DO THIS BY

00:56:29.219 --> 00:56:30.820
CREATING A LOCAL VOLUNTARY AFTER

00:56:30.887 --> 00:56:32.188

STUDENTS.

01:08:46.655 --> 01:08:49.625
WHO START GOING TO COLLEGE AND

THEY CAN'T GET THE BOOKS PAID

01:08:51.327 --> 01:08:52.127
THE SUBMIT ALL OF THE

01:08:52.194 --> 01:08:53.562
VERIFICATION THROUGH WELFARE

01:08:53.629 --> 01:08:54.330
SYSTEM?

01:08:54.396 --> 01:08:55.998
BUT IT GETS HUNG UP IN THE PLAKA

01:08:56.065 --> 01:08:57.933
SEE AN UP TO TWO WEEKS TO HAVE

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.468

SCHOOL AGAIN.

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:06.542
AND AND JUST TO THE LEFT TO

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:07.877
INVESTMENT SHATTERED WHAT THIS

01:09:07.943 --> 01:09:09.178
BILL WOULD DO WOULD FIFTEEN DAYS

01:09:09.245 --> 01:09:11.280
BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE

01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:20.589
VERIFICATION AND WE WORKING WITH

01:09:20.656 --> 01:09:22.024

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:22.958
BILL.

01:09:23.025 --> 01:09:24.360
THAT THE STORY WOULD HAVE TO

01:09:24.426 --> 01:09:25.694
PROVIDE VERIFICATION OF HOW THEY

01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:26.896
SPEND THE MONEY.

01:09:26.962 --> 01:09:29.231
AND THE FOR COST MORE THAN FIVE

01:09:29.298 --> 01:09:30.733
HUNDRED DOLLARS THEN THE ACCOUNT

01:09:30.799 --> 01:09:32.001
THEN THE COUNTY WOULD REIMBURSE

01:09:32.067 --> 01:09:33.168
ADDITIONAL AMOUNT.

01:09:33.235 --> 01:09:43.245
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO SHOW HOW

01:09:43.312 --> 01:09:43.879
THEY SPEND THE MONEY IS THAT THE

01:09:43.946 --> 01:09:45.648
SPONSOR.

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:46.582
OKAY WELL OUT OF THE ME TRY TO

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:47.816
ENHANCE A LITTLE BIT WHICH IS

01:09:47.883 --> 01:09:48.350
THAT THERE ARE.

01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:49.184
THIS PROVIDES ANOTHER OPTION

01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:50.252
SENATOR THAT YES THERE THERE IS

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:51.086
A SUPPORT -- SERVICES FOR

01:09:51.153 --> 01:09:51.787
ANCILLARY EXPENSES THIS TRIES TO

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:52.888
CREATE A PROTOCOL FOR HOW THEY

01:09:52.955 --> 01:09:53.556
CAN GET PAYMENT EARLY.

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:54.590
WITH THE REQUIREMENT FOR

01:09:54.657 --> 01:09:55.958
RECEIPTS -- DEPEND TO BUY BOOKS

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:56.592
BUT THAT IT'S NOT MY INTENTION

01:09:56.659 --> 01:09:57.526
TO CREATE THAT COMPLEXITY SOME

01:09:57.593 --> 01:09:58.527
VERY COMMITTED TO IF THAT IF

01:09:58.594 --> 01:10:00.563
THAT THIS OVERLAY CREATES THAT

01:10:00.629 --> 01:10:01.797
CONFUSION IS NOT SOMETHING ANY

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:02.998
OF THIS WASHER AND ARE COMMITTED

01:10:03.065 --> 01:10:04.266
TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE

01:10:04.333 --> 01:10:05.467
STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT ISN'T

01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:06.001
THE CASE.

01:10:06.068 --> 01:10:07.169
OKAY AND AND AND AND AND I

01:10:07.236 --> 01:10:08.237
CERTAINLY APPRECIATE AND THEY

01:10:08.304 --> 01:10:08.804
KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT YOUR

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:11.073
ATTENTION SO I JUST I JUST WANT

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:12.474
TO THINK ABOUT HOW THE SITS IN

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:15.544
THE LARGER SCHEME SO. FOR

01:10:15.611 --> 01:10:20.082
EXAMPLE -- A AND I THINK EITHER

01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.849
OF US RISING BECAUSE AT THE OF

01:10:20.916 --> 01:10:21.650
THE PRESENTED BEFORE BUDGETS OF

01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:22.618
THREE EVERY TIME OF OVERSEEING

01:10:22.685 --> 01:10:23.319
THIS I'M THINKING OKAY.

01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:25.321
NOW THIS VERY SAME SOCIAL WORKER

01:10:25.387 --> 01:10:26.755
WHO'S SUPPOSED TO BE MOVING THE

01:10:26.822 --> 01:10:27.957
MONEY UP FRONT ON THE ANSWER

01:10:28.023 --> 01:10:29.658
SERVICES IS THE SAME ONE WHO IS

01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:31.327
GOING TO BE SIGNING OFF FIFTEEN

01:10:31.393 --> 01:10:32.194
DAYS BEFORE.

01:10:32.261 --> 01:10:34.396
AND SO IN SOME SENSESI THINK

01:10:34.463 --> 01:10:37.633
PART OF IT IS TRY TO FIGURE OUT --

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:39.301
AT AND I WANT THIS BUILDING

01:10:39.368 --> 01:10:41.570
BEFORE BUT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:10:41.637 --> 01:10:43.539
BE MOST EFFECTIVELY GET THE

01:10:43.606 --> 01:10:45.174
FUNDS TO THE STUDENTS IN A

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.375
TIMELY MANNER.

01:10:46.442 --> 01:10:47.776
YOU FROM OUT FUNDS IT ALSO

01:10:47.843 --> 01:10:49.345
MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT I GUESS

01:10:49.411 --> 01:10:51.113
MICHAEL OVERHEAD -- THAT THAT

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:52.581
WILL HAPPEN IN TERMS OF

01:10:52.648 --> 01:10:54.516
APPROVALS CLIMB BACK MONEY AND

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:58.020
SO FORTH SO -- AT IT AND SO I DO

01:10:58.087 --> 01:11:00.122
SO -- HOPE THAT YOU CAN TRY TO

01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:01.357
WORK ON LOOK AT THESE MECHANISMS

01:11:01.423 --> 01:11:02.291
HOW TO BRING TOGETHER FOR

01:11:02.358 --> 01:11:04.460
EXAMPLE MAYBE IT IS GOING TO BE

01:11:04.526 --> 01:11:06.462
A DAD MAYBE MORE ABOUT SAYING

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:06.829
THAT.

01:11:06.895 --> 01:11:08.163
YELLED HERE SOME GUIDELINES ON

01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:10.099
LIKE ON THE IT'S A SERVICES YOU

01:11:10.165 --> 01:11:11.467
NEED TO ADVANCE THE MONEY BY

01:11:11.533 --> 01:11:13.068
CERTAIN DEADLINE OR SOMETHING.

01:11:13.135 --> 01:11:15.404
AND THEN TRY TO INSTEAD OF GOING

01:11:15.471 --> 01:11:16.405
TO WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW SO

01:11:16.472 --> 01:11:17.406
JUST BE SURE WE TAKE THESE TWO

01:11:17.473 --> 01:11:23.412
PROCESSES AND FIND A WAY THIS.

01:11:23.479 --> 01:11:26.181
BRING THEM TOGETHER IN A WAY

01:11:26.248 --> 01:11:27.082
LIKE ED AND MAKE THEM AND AND

01:11:27.149 --> 01:11:28.450
AND SO THAT BECAUSE THIS PROCESS

01:11:28.517 --> 01:11:29.618
DOESN'T WORK DOESN'T AS A MEAN

01:11:29.685 --> 01:11:30.853
WE ALWAYS CREATE A BRAND NEW ONE

01:11:30.919 --> 01:11:31.253
BUT WHAT WE DO IS.

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.688
BUT THE NEW RULES ON THE OLD ONE

01:11:32.755 --> 01:11:33.455
TO MAKE THAT WORK USING THINGS

01:11:33.522 --> 01:11:34.023
THAT WE KNOW SO FOR EXAMPLE

01:11:34.089 --> 01:11:35.991
MAYBE THEY NEED TO ADVANCE MONEY.

01:11:36.058 --> 01:11:37.092
AND THEN RECLAIM THIS IS THE

01:11:37.159 --> 01:11:38.460
MECHANISM USING NOW IN THAT

01:11:38.527 --> 01:11:39.995
PROCESS VERSUS SAYING WE HAVE

01:11:40.062 --> 01:11:42.765
THIS PROCESS HERE WE HAVE THAT

01:11:42.831 --> 01:11:46.068
PROCESS THERE AND SO ANYWAY I I

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:48.203
WILL URGE YOU TO CONTINUE TO

01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:48.537
WORK ON THAT.

01:11:48.604 --> 01:11:49.405
THANK YOU THE AUTHORS COMMITTED

01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:50.439

01:32:12.026 --> 01:32:13.794
SO YEAH I WOULD IT IN RESPONSE

01:32:13.861 --> 01:32:17.698
TO YOUR QUESTION CENTER I THINK

01:32:17.765 --> 01:32:19.533
THAT -- THEY'RE DEFINITELY I

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:20.201
THINK I WOULD JUST ECHO WHAT THE

01:32:20.268 --> 01:32:21.135
CENTER SAID THERE IS A PLACE FOR

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:22.737
PROBATION TO CONTINUE DOING THE

01:32:22.803 --> 01:32:24.305
WORK THE GOOD WORK THE PROBATION

01:32:24.372 --> 01:32:25.640
IS ALREADY DOING.

01:32:25.706 --> 01:32:27.441
THIS IS TARGETING YOUTH PRE

01:32:27.508 --> 01:32:29.410
ARREST THERE IS NUMEROUS STUDIES

01:32:29.477 --> 01:32:30.778
THAT SHOW THAT THE FURTHER A

01:32:30.845 --> 01:32:33.047
CHILD OR YOUTH GOES THROUGH THE

01:32:33.114 --> 01:32:34.715
JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM STARTING

01:32:34.782 --> 01:32:35.816
AT A REST.

01:32:35.883 --> 01:32:37.551
THE FURTHER THE HARMS THAT

01:32:37.618 --> 01:32:39.921
HAPPENED AND SO THIS BILL REALLY

01:32:39.987 --> 01:32:41.022
IS TRYING TO TARGET WHAT

01:32:41.088 --> 01:32:42.723
BASICALLY THE QUESTION IS WHY

01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:44.191
SHOULD YOU HAVE TO GET ON

01:32:44.258 --> 01:32:46.127
PROBATION TO GET SERVE SERVICES

01:32:46.193 --> 01:32:47.261
AND SUPPORTS.

01:32:47.328 --> 01:32:48.629
THAT THEY SHOULDN'T THEY SHOULD

01:32:48.696 --> 01:32:50.398
BE ABLE TO GET THE SERVICES AND

01:32:50.464 --> 01:32:52.533
SUPPORTS IN THEIR COMMUNITY IF

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:54.635
THEY HAPPEN TO GET ARRESTED AND

01:32:54.702 --> 01:32:55.736
GET ON PROBATION AND CAN GET

01:32:55.803 --> 01:32:57.071
THOSE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS

01:32:57.138 --> 01:32:59.473
THROUGH PROBATION.

01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:02.043
THAT'S GREAT BUT BEFORE THAT.

01:33:02.109 --> 01:33:03.611
THE KIDS THROUGHOUT DIFFERENT

01:33:03.678 --> 01:33:06.113
COMMUNITIES DON'T HAVE THE SAME

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:07.515
ACCESS TO SERVICES IMPORTS IF

01:33:07.581 --> 01:33:08.416
YOU LOOK AT WHILE THE

01:33:08.482 --> 01:33:10.318
COMMUNITIES THERE ARE WAY MORE

01:33:10.384 --> 01:33:12.019
SERVICES SUPPORTS THAT ARE

01:33:12.086 --> 01:33:13.220
AVAILABLE FOR TO YOUTH.

01:33:13.287 --> 01:33:15.056
THAT ARE NOT SIMILARLY SITUATED

01:33:15.122 --> 01:33:17.191
IN POOR COMMUNITIES WHAT LA

01:33:17.258 --> 01:33:18.326
COUNTY HAS DONE.

01:33:18.392 --> 01:33:19.927
THEY DID A LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS TO

01:33:19.994 --> 01:33:21.796
SEE WHERE ARE THE SERVICES IN

01:33:21.862 --> 01:33:23.264
THE PORTS AND WHERE DO THEY NEED

01:33:23.331 --> 01:33:24.699
TO BE AND THIS OFFICE OF YOUTH

01:33:24.765 --> 01:33:26.233
DEVELOPMENT DIVERSION WOULD BE

01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:27.668
COORDINATING THOSE SERVICES

01:33:27.735 --> 01:33:28.235
SUPPORTS.

01:33:28.302 --> 01:33:30.171
SPECIFICALLY THROUGH A PUBLIC

01:33:30.237 --> 01:33:32.406
HEALTH APPROACH -- WITHOUT

01:33:32.473 --> 01:33:33.908
HAVING THE HARMS OF SYSTEM

01:33:33.975 --> 01:33:35.776
INVOLVEMENT SO THAT'S REALLY THE

01:33:35.843 --> 01:33:38.546
CRUX OF IT I AM IF THAT ANSWERS

01:33:38.612 --> 01:33:39.413
YOUR QUESTION [inaudible]

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:40.982

01:33:44.085 --> 01:33:45.086
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SENATOR --

01:33:45.152 --> 01:33:46.187
JUST A QUICK QUESTION MY

01:33:46.253 --> 01:33:48.522
UNDERSTANDING IS THIS IS A

01:33:48.589 --> 01:33:50.024
VOLUNTARY PROGRAM.

01:33:50.091 --> 01:33:52.293
SO WHY WOULD YOU BE OPPOSED TO

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:53.527
IT.

01:33:53.594 --> 01:33:55.229
THE PROBATION BARBARA PROBATION

01:33:55.296 --> 01:33:57.665
STONE A GREAT JOB AND EVERYTHING.

01:33:57.732 --> 01:33:59.567
WHAT WHY WOULD YOU BE OPPOSED TO

01:33:59.633 --> 01:34:00.835
THIS?

01:34:00.901 --> 01:34:04.238
OTHER POSSIBILITY -- OR YOU

01:34:04.305 --> 01:34:05.606
DON'T HAVE TO DO IT AT ALL.

01:34:05.673 --> 01:34:06.874
IF YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING A

01:34:06.941 --> 01:34:09.176
GREAT JOB THEN YOU DON'T NEED TO

01:34:09.243 --> 01:34:10.811
AGREE TO DO THIS PROGRAM THAT'S

01:34:10.878 --> 01:34:12.213
WHAT HAS ME PUZZLED.

01:34:12.279 --> 01:34:14.181
AND I KNOW THERE'S OPPOSITION TO

01:34:14.248 --> 01:34:15.649
A BUT I DON'T I DON'T GET IT

01:34:15.716 --> 01:34:17.184
SOME OF YEAH I I I CERTAINLY

01:34:17.251 --> 01:34:18.552
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION I THINK --

01:34:18.619 --> 01:34:20.688
PART OF THE CONCERN REALLY IN MY

01:34:20.755 --> 01:34:21.255
APOLOGIES.

01:34:21.322 --> 01:34:22.890
FOR SINGLE -- I THINK PART OF

01:34:22.957 --> 01:34:24.091
THE CONCERN IS ABOUT --

01:34:24.158 --> 01:34:25.893
OBVIOUSLY I WE SHARE THE FOCUS

01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:27.661
TO BREAK DOWN SILOS IN THIS

01:34:27.728 --> 01:34:28.295
REGARD AND TO BUILD THE

01:34:28.362 --> 01:34:30.097
COLLABORATIONS -- MANY OF WHICH

01:34:30.164 --> 01:34:31.799
PROBATION IS DONE WITH WITH OUR

01:34:31.866 --> 01:34:33.167
LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT

01:34:33.234 --> 01:34:34.535
SOCIAL SERVICES A COMMUNITY

01:34:34.602 --> 01:34:36.437
BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND SO I

01:34:36.504 --> 01:34:39.240
THINK THERE'S A A VERY -- REAL

01:34:39.306 --> 01:34:40.641
OPERATIONAL CONCERN THAT BY.

01:34:40.708 --> 01:34:42.376
RATHER THAN USING THE EXISTING

01:34:42.443 --> 01:34:43.944
KIND OF COUNTY INFRASTRUCTURE TO

01:34:44.011 --> 01:34:45.212
BUILD THOSE LINKAGES LOCALLY

01:34:45.279 --> 01:34:47.014
AMONG ALL THE COUNTY DEPARTMENTS

01:34:47.081 --> 01:34:48.549
IS SETTING UP.

01:34:48.616 --> 01:34:50.618
A KIND OF NEW OFFICE -- THAT

01:34:50.684 --> 01:34:51.852
WOULD HAVE THAT WOULD HAVE SHARE

01:34:51.919 --> 01:34:52.887
SOME OF THE MISSION WITH

01:34:52.953 --> 01:34:54.321
PROBATION BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF

01:34:54.388 --> 01:34:55.456
THE THINGS THAT.

01:34:55.523 --> 01:34:57.058
OFTEN IS OVERLOOKED IS THE

01:34:57.124 --> 01:34:58.192
EXTENSIVE WORK THAT PROBATION

01:34:58.259 --> 01:34:59.460
DOES NOT JUST ON THE YOUTH ONCE

01:34:59.527 --> 01:35:00.995
THEY COME TO US AND DIVERTING

01:35:01.062 --> 01:35:02.563
THEM OUT OF OUR HOLES THE REALLY

01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:03.831
TO DO A LOT OF THAT EARLY

01:35:03.898 --> 01:35:05.299
INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION

01:35:05.366 --> 01:35:07.134
WORKS -- TO TO PROVIDE SOME OF

01:35:07.201 --> 01:35:08.469
THOSE COMMUNITIES SUPPORTS

01:35:08.536 --> 01:35:09.837
BEFORE THEY'RE ACTUALLY --

01:35:09.904 --> 01:35:12.206
COMING TO US ON A PETITION AND

01:35:12.273 --> 01:35:13.474
SO AGAIN I THINK THE CONCERN IS

01:35:13.541 --> 01:35:15.042
THAT WE DO YOU SET UP AGAIN

01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:16.811
SIMILAR TO KIND OF HAVING TO

01:35:16.877 --> 01:35:18.846
STATE AGENCIES -- HAVING A

01:35:18.913 --> 01:35:20.347
SHARED MISSION THAT.

01:35:20.414 --> 01:35:22.483
WITH THE INTENT TO BREAK DOWN

01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:24.418
SILOS THAT ACTUALLY CREATE MORE

01:35:24.485 --> 01:35:26.353
ISSUES OF SERVING YOUTH IN WHAT

01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:28.389
CAPACITY AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE

01:35:28.456 --> 01:35:29.924
THAT THERE ARE IN USE THAT ARE.

01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:31.792
NOT BEING SERVED AS A RESULT OF

01:35:31.859 --> 01:35:32.893
THOSE CONCURRENT PROCESS BUT IF

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:34.795
YOU HAVE THESE CONCERNS YOU

01:35:34.862 --> 01:35:36.497
DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

01:35:36.564 --> 01:35:37.898
IS THAT RIGHT IT THE CHOICE

01:35:37.965 --> 01:35:39.567
WOULD BE UP TO A COUNTY -- SO IS

01:35:39.633 --> 01:35:41.535
PRESUMABLY THE COUNTIES GOING TO

01:35:41.602 --> 01:35:42.002
COORDINATE.

01:35:42.069 --> 01:35:42.970
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH

01:35:43.037 --> 01:35:44.505

DETERMINE WE WANT TO TRY THIS

01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:52.246
AGAIN.

01:35:52.313 --> 01:35:53.514
MY RESPONSE WOULD BE.

01:35:53.581 --> 01:35:54.148
IF THE COUNTY WANTS TO TRY THE

01:35:54.215 --> 01:35:55.316
PILOT CAN DRAW MORE RESOURCES TO

01:35:55.382 --> 01:35:56.250
ASSIST THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF

01:35:56.317 --> 01:35:57.051
RESOURCES.

01:35:57.118 --> 01:35:57.852
IF IF PROBATION THINKS THEY HAVE

01:35:57.918 --> 01:36:00.421
THE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THESE

01:36:00.488 --> 01:36:02.323
