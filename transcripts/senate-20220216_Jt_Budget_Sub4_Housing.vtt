00:43:57.634 --> 00:43:58.869
DELIBERATING ON ON HOW THAT

00:43:58.936 --> 00:44:00.704
PROGRAM IS ADEQUATELY

00:44:00.771 --> 00:44:02.272
ADDRESSING. A ST STE CALDERON

COURSE BEEN PROGRAMS THERE'S A

00:44:08.645 --> 00:44:10.714
EXAM. AMONG MANY- IN TERMS OF

00:44:10.781 --> 00:44:13.017
WHERE WE COME SO- ONE LET AND

00:44:13.083 --> 00:44:14.485
THEN THE THERE'S A NEW. OF MAYBE

00:44:14.551 --> 00:44:15.519
THIS IS THE POINT OF MAKE INTO

00:44:15.586 --> 00:44:17.821
OF A LESSON LEARNED- WHERE WE

00:44:17.888 --> 00:44:19.456
ARE DEPLOYING ESPECIALLY WHEN

00:44:19.523 --> 00:44:20.691

ARGUMENT CONTINUES OF CARE

00:44:27.297 --> 00:44:29.533
NURSING HOMELESSNESS- AND I

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.235
THINK WE HAVE TRIED TO COMBINE

00:44:31.301 --> 00:44:32.369
THOSE WITH ROBUST TECHNICAL

00:44:32.436 --> 00:44:33.570
ASSISTANCE THIS CONTAINS OF CARE

00:44:33.637 --> 00:44:35.372
AS I KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA I C.

00:44:35.439 --> 00:44:36.840
H. HAS- BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T

00:44:36.907 --> 00:44:39.410
REALLY. THIS IS AN OBSERVATION-

00:44:39.476 --> 00:44:41.612
WE HAVE REALLY DILUTES THOSE

00:44:41.678 --> 00:44:43.247
ENTITIES WITH QUITE A BIT OF

00:44:43.313 --> 00:44:44.948
FUNDING OR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS

00:44:45.015 --> 00:44:45.549
RIGHT IT TAKES TIME TO BUILD

00:44:45.616 --> 00:44:48.218
THAT CAPACITY- MANY OF THEM MAY

00:44:48.285 --> 00:44:49.653
BE UNDER RESOURCE FOR MANY YEARS

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.355
AND JUST IN THE IN THE COURSE OF

00:44:51.422 --> 00:44:53.390
THE LAST FEW YEARS. I MEAN WE'RE

00:44:53.457 --> 00:44:53.924
PUTTING BILLIONS INTO THE

00:44:53.991 --> 00:44:56.527
SYSTEMS. AND I THINK- PART OF

00:44:56.593 --> 00:44:57.795
THE FRUSTRATION OF THE SLOAN IS

00:44:57.861 --> 00:44:59.263
THAT MANY OF US FEEL LIKE WE YOU

00:44:59.329 --> 00:45:00.531
KNOW WE'RE RESPONSIBLE TO THE TO

00:45:00.597 --> 00:45:02.533
THE FACTS FOR EXAMPLE ON ON HOW

00:45:02.599 --> 00:45:04.068
THOSE LOCALS IN TORRANCE AND LOS

00:45:04.134 --> 00:45:06.370
FINES- AND WE HAVE TO. DO I

00:45:06.437 --> 00:45:07.905
THINK THE OBSERVATION THERE

00:45:07.971 --> 00:45:08.872
RIGHT IS IT'S TAKEN THEM SOME

00:45:08.939 --> 00:45:10.140
TIME. IN A COMPETITIVE

00:45:10.207 --> 00:45:16.113
ENVIRONMENT IN AN ENVIRONMENT.

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:17.581
WHERE IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT TO

00:45:17.648 --> 00:45:18.849
MAYBE ATTRACT. YOU KNOW. NOT

00:45:18.916 --> 00:45:19.516
PROP EMPLOYMENT AND ALL THE SORT

00:45:19.583 --> 00:45:20.484
OF- THEIR RAMP UP. AND I THINK

00:45:20.551 --> 00:45:22.286
THAT SOME TO KEEP IN MIND AS WE

00:45:22.352 --> 00:45:23.220
THINK ABOUT A LOT OF THESE

00:45:23.287 --> 00:45:24.488
RESOURCES THAT ARE FLOWING DOWN.

00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:26.256
LOCAL LEVELS- IT WAS VERY

00:45:26.323 --> 00:45:28.058
ENTITIES YOU KNOW ARE ALSO

00:45:28.125 --> 00:45:29.326
TRYING TO BUILD CAPACITY HAVE

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:31.028
BEEN OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS.

00:45:31.095 --> 00:45:32.229
AS WE'VE GIVEN A LOT OF

00:45:32.296 --> 00:45:33.964
DIFFERENT SOURCES RIGHT. I WILL

00:45:34.031 --> 00:45:35.332
SPEAK TO THE I. C. CHOICES BUT

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:36.366
HE'S KEEPING HALF OF COURSE FOR

00:45:36.433 --> 00:45:39.036
THOSE ENTITIES. WE A CD. S.

00:45:39.103 --> 00:45:41.271
SIGNIFICANT FUSION. TO THE

00:45:41.338 --> 00:45:43.507
CARRIAGE ACT- THAT WAS A SUCH A

00:45:43.574 --> 00:45:44.775
GOOD THE MERCY SOLUTIONS GRANT

00:45:44.842 --> 00:45:46.276
PROGRAM OVER THREE HUNDRED

00:45:46.343 --> 00:45:48.312
MILLION ATTENDED ALSO FLOWED. TO

00:45:48.378 --> 00:45:50.280
THOSE ENTITIES. I SEE A LOT OF

00:45:50.347 --> 00:45:51.648
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WITH

00:45:51.715 --> 00:45:53.484
FEDERAL FUNDS OR STATE FUNDS AND

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:54.451
SO YOU'D THEY'RE DEALING WITH A

00:45:54.518 --> 00:45:56.320
LOT OF THAT- SO THAT IS A LESSON

00:45:56.386 --> 00:45:57.521
LEARNED I DON'T TO BE TOO. TOO

00:45:57.588 --> 00:45:59.256
LONG IN MY ANSWER BUT I THINK

00:45:59.323 --> 00:46:01.992
IT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND-

00:46:02.059 --> 00:46:03.327
THAT TO THE TO THE POINT I HEARD

00:46:03.393 --> 00:46:04.695
FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MONEY

00:46:04.761 --> 00:46:06.096
ALONE IS NOT THE ANSWER THAT'S

00:46:06.163 --> 00:46:08.398
WHAT WE THINK WE HAVE. YOUR

00:46:08.465 --> 00:46:09.466
ROBUST TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

00:46:09.533 --> 00:46:11.435
PROVIDERS TO SEND TO THOSE

00:46:11.502 --> 00:46:12.369
COMMUNITIES OVER THE PAST COUPLE

00:46:12.436 --> 00:46:14.138
YEARS TO HELP NOT. ALL THE PLANS

00:46:14.204 --> 00:46:15.672
FIGURE OUT HOW TO SPEND THOSE

00:46:15.739 --> 00:46:16.640
MONIES. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

00:46:16.707 --> 00:46:18.942
FROM A CAPACITY STANDPOINT-

00:46:19.009 --> 00:46:19.943
THERE STILL BUT DON'T GET

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:20.978
DRESSED. THEY'RE STILL RAMPING

00:46:21.044 --> 00:46:23.080
UP AS WELL. SUCH AS ONE OF

00:46:23.147 --> 00:46:24.681
PROBABLY SEVERAL LESSONS LEARNED

00:46:24.748 --> 00:46:25.916
BECAUSE I THINK. THE PARTNERSHIP

00:46:25.983 --> 00:46:27.451
WE TALK ABOUT WE'RE PRETTY I

00:46:27.518 --> 00:46:28.719
THINK IT'S PRETTY GOOD AT THAT

00:46:28.785 --> 00:46:29.753
AT THE STATE LEVEL ACROSS

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:31.522
DEPARTMENTS CERTAINLY IS ALWAYS

00:46:31.588 --> 00:46:32.890
WITH YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON. BUT

00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:34.725
THE LOCALS ARE PARTNERS HERE-

00:46:34.791 --> 00:46:36.326
WILL YOU SUPPLY COUNTY WE NEED A

00:46:36.393 --> 00:46:38.095
WILLING LOCAL PARK. WE'VE BEEN

00:46:38.162 --> 00:46:39.029
THRILLED THE DIFFERENCE SO MANY

00:46:39.096 --> 00:46:40.664
ONE LOCAL PARTNERS. RIGHT THERE

00:46:40.731 --> 00:46:42.032
HAS TO BE THE WILL TO DO THOSE

00:46:42.099 --> 00:46:43.500
EFFORTS THERE HAS TO BE THAT.

00:46:43.567 --> 00:46:44.568
THE ATTENTION AT THOSE LOCAL

00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:48.338
LEVELS. TO ALSO HIGHER UP. AND

00:46:48.405 --> 00:46:49.373
WORK WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY

00:46:49.439 --> 00:46:51.408
BASED PROVIDER. A COMMUNITY AND

00:46:51.475 --> 00:46:53.243
ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF SO THAT'S

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:54.511
ONE LESSON LEARNED IF I DIDN'T

00:46:54.578 --> 00:47:02.319
GO. TO ACTUALLY LIKE HAPPY TO

00:47:02.386 --> 00:47:03.320
EXPAND ELSEWHERE. NO THAT WAS

00:47:03.387 --> 00:47:04.421

EACH OTHER AND WORKING TOGETHER

00:47:11.595 --> 00:47:12.095
IN A COORDINATED FASHION IT

00:47:12.162 --> 00:47:13.797
MAKES IT HARD FOR THE PEOPLE ON

00:47:13.864 --> 00:47:14.565
THE STREETS. TO DO WHAT FOLKS

00:47:14.631 --> 00:47:16.433

ON THE WHOLE. I MEAN I THINK I

00:57:17.367 --> 00:57:18.935

00:57:19.602 --> 00:57:23.273
HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY- D. YOU

00:57:23.339 --> 00:57:24.674
KNOW OUR OUR STORIES ARE

00:57:24.741 --> 00:57:26.075
FORTUNATE ORTIZ UNDER NUMBER OF

00:57:26.142 --> 00:57:28.812
LAWS. ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE

00:57:28.878 --> 00:57:29.712
THAT ALL THE VARIOUS

00:57:29.779 --> 00:57:31.681
STREAMLINING EFFORTS SB THIRTY

00:57:31.748 --> 00:57:33.483
FIVE AND OTHERS. ARE HERE TO AND

00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:34.784
USE PROBABLY ALREADY SEEN THAT

00:57:34.851 --> 00:57:36.386
IN SOME OF SOME OF THE-

00:57:36.452 --> 00:57:37.620
COMMUNICATIONS WE'VE HAD WITH

00:57:37.687 --> 00:57:39.055
JURISDICTIONS SO FAR WE HAVE

00:57:39.122 --> 00:57:40.757
BEEN ABLE TO BREAK. LOOSE

00:57:40.824 --> 00:57:42.992
SEVERAL HOUSING PROJECTS. THAT

00:57:43.059 --> 00:57:44.594
BY AT LEAST BEGINNING WITH

00:57:44.661 --> 00:57:45.495
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND

00:57:45.562 --> 00:57:46.830
REMINDING THOSE RESTRICTIONS OF

00:57:46.896 --> 00:57:49.365
THEIR OBLIGATIONS- IN SOME CASES

00:57:49.432 --> 00:57:51.835
HAVING TO ESCALATE- YEAH I THINK

00:57:51.901 --> 00:57:54.604
IT. IS GOING TO BE QUITE HELPFUL

00:57:54.671 --> 00:57:55.238
BECAUSE I THINK WHAT WE DO SEE

00:57:55.305 --> 00:57:58.041
AN- A NUMBER OF STREAMLINING

00:57:58.107 --> 00:57:59.509
MEASURES HAVE PASSED. AND OUR

00:57:59.576 --> 00:58:02.745
CURRENT LAW. IS SO- ENFORCING

00:58:02.812 --> 00:58:04.214
THOSE LAWS WILL BE QUITE

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:06.649
IMPORTANT. AS WE HIT THE NEXT

00:58:06.716 --> 00:58:07.450
HOUSING ELEMENT CYCLE WHICH WERE

00:58:07.517 --> 00:58:09.652
ALREADY IN- WE SEE THOSE

00:58:09.719 --> 00:58:11.487
COMMITMENTS. AND THOSE RESOUNDS

00:58:11.554 --> 00:58:13.756
AS A CONTRACT. YOU KNOW AND NOW

00:58:13.823 --> 00:58:14.924
THAT WITH THE ENFORCEMENT

00:58:14.991 --> 00:58:16.192
AUTHORITIES WE HAVE. YOU KNOW

00:58:16.259 --> 00:58:17.327
WE'RE GONNA HOLD COMMITTEES THAT

00:58:17.393 --> 00:58:20.663
CONTRACT. AND WHILE- WELL OF

00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:23.299
COURSE. THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

00:58:23.366 --> 00:58:24.701
DO NOT HAVE TO BUILD THE HOUSING

00:58:24.767 --> 00:58:26.102
THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:58:26.169 --> 00:58:27.604
THEY WERE MOVING. DATE AFTER

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:29.072
AGAIN IF I ALL BARRIERS WITHIN

00:58:29.138 --> 00:58:32.008
THEIR LOCAL PROCESS SHE'S. AND

00:58:32.075 --> 00:58:37.947
THEY HAVE TO PROGRAMS THAT. WERE

00:58:38.014 --> 00:58:38.948
AND SO NOW WITH BIRTH AND

00:58:39.015 --> 00:58:40.250
PORTSMOUTH FORTY WE WILL BE A TO

00:58:40.316 --> 00:58:42.185

00:58:42.252 --> 00:58:43.653
IF THEY'RE HEARING TO WHAT

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:48.324
AGREED TO AND THERE PROTEST. AND

00:58:48.391 --> 00:58:49.392
SO- THAT'S IS A COUPLE COUPLE

00:58:49.459 --> 00:58:51.094
THINGS I'D SAY I'M I THINK. IT'S

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:52.862

ARMSTRONG TO WITH THAT DECISION

00:59:34.437 --> 00:59:35.672
BUT THE BASED WAS THAT IT SHOULD

00:59:35.738 --> 00:59:40.410
BE AS- DOING ITS OWN DO PROCESS

00:59:40.476 --> 00:59:41.878

DATA YOU GAVE US IS REALLY

01:03:09.719 --> 01:03:13.022
EXCELLENT- BUT I HAVE HEARD FROM

01:03:13.089 --> 01:03:14.824
SOME OF THE NONPROFIT

01:03:14.891 --> 01:03:16.092
ORGANIZATIONS THAT BUILD HOUSING

01:03:16.159 --> 01:03:18.895
THAT. ACCESSING THE FIRST TIME

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:20.029
HOME BUYER PROGRAM HAS BEEN

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:22.732
PROBLEMATIC AND SO IT MAY BE

01:03:22.798 --> 01:03:25.902
THAT IT. THAT IT'S BY THAT IT'S

01:03:25.968 --> 01:03:26.602
BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE-

01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:28.070
REQUIREMENTS THAT BETTER THERE

01:03:28.137 --> 01:03:29.872
AND I'D I'D LIKE THIS TO

01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:31.841
UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:35.178
ON TO THE QUESTIONS- THIS ONE IS

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:36.812
FOR THE INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON

01:03:36.879 --> 01:03:38.481
HOMELESSNESS IN EACH CD. THE

01:03:38.548 --> 01:03:40.983
SACRAMENTO BEE REPORTED THAT-

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:42.985
THREE ROOM KEY PROJECTS ARE SET

01:03:43.052 --> 01:03:44.153
TO CLOSE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:46.055
WHICH TOGETHER. TOGETHER

01:03:46.122 --> 01:03:47.957
TEMPORARILY HOUSE THREE HUNDRED

01:03:48.024 --> 01:03:49.158
AND THIRTY THREE HOMELESS

01:03:49.225 --> 01:03:51.460
PEOPLE. THE COUNTY STAFF ARE

01:03:51.527 --> 01:03:52.895
REPORTEDLY TRYING TO FIND OTHER

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:54.463
HOUSING OPTIONS ARE HOTELS FOR

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:56.132
THOSE BEING DISPLACED AND SO.

01:03:56.199 --> 01:04:00.102
THAT'S REALLY DISTRESSING- IF WE

01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:01.971
ALL WORK UP HERE SO WE

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:04.540
UNDERSTAND AND SEE. THE SEVERITY

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:06.075
OF THE HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM HERE

01:04:06.142 --> 01:04:07.877
LOCALLY- AND IT'S JUST A

01:04:07.944 --> 01:04:09.979
MICROCOSM OF WHAT YOU SEE ALL

01:04:10.046 --> 01:04:12.181
OVER THE STATE AND- TO. TO HAVE

01:04:12.248 --> 01:04:13.749
COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT.

01:04:13.816 --> 01:04:15.551
PUTS PEOPLEIN HOUSING FOR A

01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:18.654
YEAR OR TWO AND THEN BASICALLY

01:04:18.721 --> 01:04:19.956
TO NOT HAVE A SOLUTION A LONG

01:04:20.022 --> 01:04:21.891
TERM SOLUTION IS. I THINK

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:24.727
UNACCEPTABLE AND- THE PUBLIC IS

01:04:24.794 --> 01:04:27.063
JUST NOT GOING TO UNDERSTAND IT

01:04:27.129 --> 01:04:28.864
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT FRANKLY SO

01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:30.499
I'M WONDERING IF. IF IF THERE'S

01:04:30.566 --> 01:04:34.503
A STRATEGY. FOR THE FACT THAT

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:36.939
THOSE RESOURCES MAY BE ENDING

01:04:37.006 --> 01:04:40.176
AND SHOULD WE HAVE BEEN PLANNING

01:04:40.243 --> 01:04:42.411
BETTER. FOR A TRANSITION INTO

01:04:42.478 --> 01:04:44.914
OTHER KINDS OF HOUSING AND- AND

01:04:44.981 --> 01:04:47.016
BASICALLY WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO I

01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:48.918
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT AS

01:04:48.985 --> 01:04:50.753
WE TALK ABOUT HOUSING THAT WE'RE

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:52.989
NOT. WE'RE NOT CREATING

01:04:53.055 --> 01:04:55.291
TEMPORARY SOLUTIONS THAT DON'T

01:04:55.358 --> 01:05:03.599
GET US ANYWHERE DOWN THE ROAD. I

01:05:03.666 --> 01:05:05.935
CAN START A SLUSH SO I'M

01:05:06.002 --> 01:05:08.437
DEFINITELY AGREED AROUND THE NET

01:05:08.504 --> 01:05:10.706
THE IMPERATIVE TO HAVE A FULL

01:05:10.773 --> 01:05:12.041
CONTINUUM OF SOLUTIONS I THINK I

01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:13.943
MENTIONED EARLIER IN OUR ACTION

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:15.478
PLAN FOR PREVENTING AND ENDING

01:05:15.544 --> 01:05:16.178
HOMELESSNESS IT WAS INCLUSIVE

01:05:16.245 --> 01:05:18.581
OF. A RANGE OF SOLUTIONS

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:20.549
INCLUDING EMERGENCY TEMPORARY

01:05:20.616 --> 01:05:23.052
AND LONGER TERM HOUSING OPTIONS

01:05:23.119 --> 01:05:25.855
I WILL SAY THAT THE ROOM KEY.

01:05:25.921 --> 01:05:28.291
SIMILAR BY OUR PARTNERS AT CVS

01:05:28.357 --> 01:05:29.959
SO I DON'T TO PRESUME. OR I'M

01:05:30.026 --> 01:05:31.227
SPEAK ON THEIR BEHALF ON WHAT

01:05:31.294 --> 01:05:33.796
PLANS THE NINE. DOWNSHIFT

01:05:33.863 --> 01:05:36.232
EFFORTS. BUT I WILL SAY THERE

01:05:36.299 --> 01:05:39.201
ARE A COUPLE OF THAT I THINK-

01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:40.536
MARK ARE SORT OF OUR GRANTS WORK

01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:43.773
IS ABLE TO DO IS TO PROVIDE OUR-

01:05:43.839 --> 01:05:44.373
PARTNERS WITH THE ABILITY TO.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:48.711
REPROGRAM FUNDS SO THAT THEY CAN

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:50.813
. AS NECESSARY THE- ON WHAT THE

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:54.150
SOLUTION MIGHT BE. SO I GUESS I

01:05:54.216 --> 01:05:55.318
TAKE FROM THAT THAT IT'S UP TO

01:05:55.384 --> 01:05:57.620
THE LOCAL LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO

01:05:57.687 --> 01:05:58.421
COME UP WITH THE PLANT AND I

01:05:58.487 --> 01:06:02.792
GUESS- ONE OF THEM. ONE OF THE-

01:06:02.858 --> 01:06:04.827
I UESS SEVEN POINT I'D I'D PUT

01:06:04.894 --> 01:06:06.462
ON IT ACT. I UNDERSTAND

01:06:06.529 --> 01:06:08.364
COMPLETELY THAT WE HAVE PUT OUT

01:06:08.431 --> 01:06:13.269
FUNDS. IN A REALLY RAPID. ON A

01:06:13.336 --> 01:06:15.805
REALLY RAPID BASIS AND THAT MANY

01:06:15.871 --> 01:06:20.576
OF THE- CCA'S DID NOT HAVE A

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:23.212
PLAN A LONG TERM PLAN. FOR WHAT

01:06:23.279 --> 01:06:26.015
NEEDED TO HAPPEN IT WAS IT WAS

01:06:26.082 --> 01:06:28.951
IT WAS EMERGENCY- GET PEOPLE

01:06:29.018 --> 01:06:30.419
INTO HOUSING IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT

01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:31.721
THE LONG TERM PLAN OF OKAY NOW

01:06:31.787 --> 01:06:33.989
WHAT ONCE ONCE WE HAVE AMEND THE

01:06:34.056 --> 01:06:36.092
HOUSING WHERE DO THEY MOVE. THAT

01:06:36.158 --> 01:06:37.793
PROVIDES A SEMI PERMANENT OR

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:39.829
PERMANENT SOLUTION FOR A WHILE

01:06:39.895 --> 01:06:41.630
SO I GET THAT IT IN MANY WAYS

01:06:41.697 --> 01:06:43.899
IT'S REALLY NOT FAIR BUT I

01:06:43.966 --> 01:06:46.469
REALLY THINK. THAT THE PLANNING

01:06:46.535 --> 01:06:48.304
THAT ALL OF THE LOCAL

01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:49.372
JURISDICTIONS ARE GOING TO BE

01:06:49.438 --> 01:06:51.474
DOING. AROUND HOME THE HOMELESS

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:55.544
ISSUE. HAS TO INCLUDE HOW MANY

01:06:55.611 --> 01:06:56.612
PEOPLE HAVE WE GOTTEN OFF THE

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:59.715
STREETS AND ARE THEY OFF THE

01:06:59.782 --> 01:07:03.319
STREETS. ENOUGH ENOUGH. IN A

01:07:03.386 --> 01:07:05.187
PERMANENT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN SAY

01:07:05.254 --> 01:07:09.325
PERMANENT- SOLUTION BECAUSE- I

01:07:09.392 --> 01:07:10.793
THINKALL OF US ARE FEELING

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:12.027
REALLY FRUSTRATED THAT THE

01:07:12.094 --> 01:07:13.763
PROBLEM SEEMS TO GROW BIGGER

01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:16.699
EVERY DAY DESPITE THAT THE-

01:07:16.766 --> 01:07:18.000
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE'VE

01:07:18.067 --> 01:07:22.371
PUT OUT. AND AND MY FRUSTRATION

01:07:22.438 --> 01:07:23.739
PERSONALLY IS THAT IT'S REALLY

01:07:23.806 --> 01:07:26.075
HARD FOR ME TO GET REPORTS FROM

01:07:26.142 --> 01:07:28.010
MY CCA'S LOCALLY IT'S DONE BY

01:07:28.077 --> 01:07:31.414
COUNTY AND SO I HAVE SIX

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.615
COUNTIES IN TRYING TO GET

01:07:32.681 --> 01:07:34.450
INFORMATION ON. ON REAL DATA

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:36.819
WHAT HOW MANY PEOPLE HOW MANY

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:39.855
FAMILIES- HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO

01:07:39.922 --> 01:07:41.891
ASSIST IS GOING TO BE REALLY

01:07:41.957 --> 01:07:44.193
IMPORTANT SO IT'S NOT JUST HOW

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:46.595
MANY HOURS OF SERVICE OR- HOW

01:07:46.662 --> 01:07:51.066
MANY. TONS OF- PERSONAL CARE

01:07:51.133 --> 01:07:53.302
PRODUCTS HAVE WE PASSED OUT IT'S

01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:55.171
REALLY IT HAD REALLY HAS TO DO

01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:56.539
WITH HOUSING AND I'M NOT I'M NOT

01:07:56.605 --> 01:07:58.073
I'M TRYING NOT TO BE CRITICAL

01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:00.676
BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:02.077
THAT WE PUT OUT ALL THIS MONEY

01:08:02.144 --> 01:08:03.179
AND NOW WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE

01:08:03.245 --> 01:08:05.347
OUT HOW TO BUILD A CAR- AND

01:08:05.414 --> 01:08:07.783
WE'VE DRIVEN IT A LITTLE BIT-

01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:09.418
BUT I REALLY HOPEFULLY THE

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:11.120
PLANTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE

01:08:11.187 --> 01:08:12.788
COMING OUT. THE LOCAL ACTION

01:08:12.855 --> 01:08:15.357
PLAN TO BY JUNE WILL WILL HAVE

01:08:15.424 --> 01:08:17.293
SOME REALLY GOOD QUANTITATIVE

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:19.595
MEASURES SO WE CAN EVALUATE.

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:21.864
WHAT WELL SO THAT WE CAN SAY.

01:08:21.931 --> 01:08:25.234
WHO'S DONE IT WELL. BEYOND AND-

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:27.870
HOW HAVE THEY DONE IT AND CAN WE

01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:30.139
REPLICATE IT IN OTHER PARTS OF

01:08:30.206 --> 01:08:34.910
THE STATE- BECAUSE- THIS THIS IS

01:08:34.977 --> 01:08:36.779
. IT'S A IT'S A AND I KNOW YOU

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:39.615
KNOW IT'S A HUMANITY ISSUE AND

01:08:39.682 --> 01:08:41.884
IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:44.487
GET OUR ARMS AROUND. EVEN IF

01:08:44.553 --> 01:08:45.754
IT'S GOING TO TAKE US A LONG

01:08:45.821 --> 01:08:46.989

WITH REGARD TO THAT DISCUSSION I

01:09:27.196 --> 01:09:30.966
JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION A

01:09:31.033 --> 01:09:31.567
COUPLE QUICK OTHER ONES. WITH

01:09:31.634 --> 01:09:32.601
RESPECT TO THE HOMELESSNESS

01:09:32.668 --> 01:09:35.237
SITUATION DO WE DO WE KNOW WHAT

01:09:35.304 --> 01:09:36.739
PERCENTAGE OF OUR HOMELESS

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:40.376
POPULATION IS NOT INTERESTED IN

01:09:40.442 --> 01:09:40.943
. PERMANENT BRICK AND MORTAR

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:43.779
HOUSING. AS SOON AS PRETTY LOW

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:45.214
BUT I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO

01:09:45.281 --> 01:09:47.383
THE QUESTION AND WITH REGARD TO

01:09:47.449 --> 01:09:50.853
THAT POPULATION WHAT DO WE

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:57.860
PROPOSE TO DO ABOUT THEM. WOULD

01:09:57.927 --> 01:09:59.328
SOMEONE LIKE TO TAKE A CRACK AT

01:09:59.395 --> 01:10:01.730
THAT I DON'T THINK HE WAS ASKING

01:10:01.797 --> 01:10:06.969
ME. I'M HAPPY TO. START US OFF

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:10.506
SO I THINK TO THE TO THE- MORE

01:10:10.573 --> 01:10:13.242
COMPLEX ISSUE OF- WHAT WHAT

01:10:13.309 --> 01:10:14.777
FOLKS SORT OF SOMETIMES REFERRED

01:10:14.843 --> 01:10:16.612
TO AS SERVICE RESISTANCE I THINK

01:10:16.679 --> 01:10:18.347
IT'S A MUCH MORE COMPLEX ISSUE.

01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:21.584
AND ONE THAT WE CONTINUE TO-

01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:23.886
WORK TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING SO

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:25.888
ONE OF THE THINGS TO BE THAT WE

01:10:25.955 --> 01:10:27.590
OFTEN THINK OUR IN OUR

01:10:27.656 --> 01:10:30.593
HOMELESSNESS ROUTE IS- WE MUST

01:10:30.659 --> 01:10:31.994
ENSURE THAT THERE ARE SERVICE

01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:34.163
RICH ENVIRONMENTS THAT FIRST AND

01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:35.864
FOREMOST START OFF WITH HOUSING.

01:10:35.931 --> 01:10:38.467
THAT PROVIDE A RANGE OF SERVICES

01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:39.201
THAT ARE PROGRAMS THAT

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:40.035
INDIVIDUAL SO THAT THE HELP THAT

01:10:40.102 --> 01:10:42.638
WE ARE PROVIDING IS INELIGIBLE

01:10:42.705 --> 01:10:44.873
INDIVIDUAL THAT NEEDS AT A WIN

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:46.875
THAT MEANS IS THAT. PEOPLE ARE

01:10:46.942 --> 01:10:50.846
ABLE TO ACCESS THE CARE THEY

01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:51.447
NEED ASKING YET. YEAH I THINK

01:10:51.513 --> 01:10:52.748
THE SORT OF THE ART OF MAKING

01:10:52.815 --> 01:10:54.817
THAT HAPPEN IT'S A VERY COMPLEX

01:10:54.883 --> 01:10:56.518
ENDEAVOR- WELL NOT COVERED

01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:57.953
WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF WHAT WE

01:10:58.020 --> 01:10:59.521
DISCUSSED TODAY. I DO THINK THAT

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:01.991
THE RANGE OF INVESTMENTS IN THE

01:11:02.057 --> 01:11:04.259
SERVICE PORTION OF HOMELESSNESS.

01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:05.361
THE SERVICE PORTION OF THE

01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:06.929
HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE SYSTEM

01:11:06.996 --> 01:11:09.398
WILL AID IN ASSURING A WIDER

01:11:09.465 --> 01:11:11.200
VARIETY OF SERVICE OPTIONS ARE

01:11:11.266 --> 01:11:13.202
AVAILABLE. BUT YOU KNOW TO THE

01:11:13.268 --> 01:11:14.203
TO THE SORT OF YOUR CORE

01:11:14.269 --> 01:11:16.739
QUESTION AROUND WHETHER WE ARE

01:11:16.805 --> 01:11:18.874
CERTAIN OF WHAT. PROPORTION OF

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:21.276
PEOPLE ARE OURS TO REFUSING

01:11:21.343 --> 01:11:22.444
SERVICE ARE UNABLE TO APPROACH

01:11:22.511 --> 01:11:24.279
THAT I THINK WE TEND TO THINK OF

01:11:24.346 --> 01:11:27.349
IT AS JUST I'M- MORE OF A OF A

01:11:27.416 --> 01:11:29.151
MATCHING OF SERVICES TO THE NEED

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:31.620
ISSUE WE DO OUR POINT IN TIME

01:11:31.687 --> 01:11:33.322
COUNTS AND TO TRY TO DETERMINE.

01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:34.723
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY

01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:37.526
HOMELESS IN. IN COMMUNITIES AND

01:11:37.593 --> 01:11:39.294
COUNTIES I'M JUST WONDERING IF

01:11:39.361 --> 01:11:41.997
WE- ACTUALLY TRY TO DETERMINE

01:11:42.064 --> 01:11:43.298
HOW MANY OF THOSE WHO ARE

01:11:43.365 --> 01:11:44.900
HOMELESS ARE HOMELESS BECAUSE

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:46.635
THEY'VE LOST THEIR JOBS. AND

01:11:46.702 --> 01:11:48.470
THEY REALLY WANT A HOUSE OR AN

01:11:48.537 --> 01:11:51.840
APARTMENT OR WHATEVER. HOW MANY-

01:11:51.907 --> 01:11:54.209
HAVE NOT HAVE JOBS BUT AREN'T

01:11:54.276 --> 01:11:55.344
ABLE TO AFFORD A HOME OR AN

01:11:55.411 --> 01:12:00.015
APARTMENT. IN WHAT AN INCH OF

01:12:00.082 --> 01:12:01.784
THOSE PEOPLE. WE ON STREET OR

01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:04.153
OTHERWISE. WHO ARE PERFECTLY

01:12:04.219 --> 01:12:06.221
CONTENT WITH THEIR LIVES WHETHER

01:12:06.288 --> 01:12:08.023
WE'RE CONTENT WITH THE TYPE OF

01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:10.426
LIFE THAT THEY'VE CHOSEN. FOR A

01:12:10.492 --> 01:12:11.860
VARIETY OF REASONS- I WOULD

01:12:11.927 --> 01:12:14.029
THINK THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT.

01:12:14.096 --> 01:12:15.931
IN TERMS OF MAKING FUNDING

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:19.034
DECISIONS AND WHERE WE PUT OUR

01:12:19.101 --> 01:12:20.636
MONEY. AND I GESS THE ANSWER IS

01:12:20.703 --> 01:12:22.204
WE DON'T COLLECT THAT DATA IS

01:12:22.271 --> 01:12:24.440
THAT CRIMINALS. SO I'M A FOLLOW

01:12:24.506 --> 01:12:26.041
UP TO THAT THERE IS A SERVER

01:12:26.108 --> 01:12:27.176
THAT'S CONNECTED TO THE POINT IN

01:12:27.242 --> 01:12:28.544
TIME COUNT THE PREVAILING

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:29.478
KNOWLEDGE IS NOT THE PRIMARY

01:12:29.545 --> 01:12:30.846
REASON FOR HOMELESSNESS IS THE

01:12:30.913 --> 01:12:32.214
AFFORDABILITY CRISIS THAT

01:12:32.281 --> 01:12:33.682
CONTINUES TO BE THE DRIVING

01:12:33.749 --> 01:12:35.451
SOURCE OF HOMELESSNESS. AND THE

01:12:35.517 --> 01:12:37.920
BARRIERS AND THE REASON WHY

01:12:37.986 --> 01:12:39.254
PEOPLE BECAME HOMELESS IN THE

01:12:39.321 --> 01:12:41.824
FIRST PLACE. SO THAT THAT THAT

01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:43.192
IS WHAT WE UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE

01:12:43.258 --> 01:12:44.760
DRIVEN BY WELL I CAN TELL YOU

01:12:44.827 --> 01:12:46.161
FROM AN ANECDOTAL STANDPOINT

01:12:46.228 --> 01:12:49.264
THE- REVEREND PEOPLE- SOME

01:12:49.331 --> 01:12:52.801
VETERANS. THAT I HAVE. SPOKEN TO

01:12:52.868 --> 01:12:56.805
ON THE STREET WHO ARE HOMELESS-

01:12:56.872 --> 01:12:59.208
VERY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE. A

01:12:59.274 --> 01:13:01.043
COLLECTION OF LIBRARY BOOKS OR

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:02.344
THEIR OWN BOOKS WHICH IS A

01:13:02.411 --> 01:13:04.713
LIBRARY IN THE SHOPPING CART

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:05.781
THAT THEY READ WHEN THEY'RE ON

01:13:05.848 --> 01:13:07.116
THE STREET. WHAT MADE A

01:13:07.182 --> 01:13:08.784
CONSCIOUS DECISION TO REMAIN

01:13:08.851 --> 01:13:10.519
THERE AND I THINK WE PROBABLY

01:13:10.586 --> 01:13:11.587
OUGHT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT

01:13:11.653 --> 01:13:13.555
BUT- I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR

01:13:13.622 --> 01:13:15.390
THIS QUESTION EITHER. ME S. MICE

01:13:15.457 --> 01:13:16.992
MY SECOND ONE YOU KNOW. FOR

01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:18.127
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE AT THAT

01:13:18.193 --> 01:13:19.461
HAVE A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF

01:13:19.528 --> 01:13:21.396
COLLEGE STUDENTS. BUT THE

01:13:21.463 --> 01:13:23.031
COMMUNITIES SEEK TO HOUSE AND I

01:13:23.098 --> 01:13:24.967
REALIZED THAT STUDENTS ROLL OVER

01:13:25.033 --> 01:13:27.436
EVERY. FOUR OR FIVE OR SIX YEARS

01:13:27.503 --> 01:13:30.105
BUT THE NUMBER GENERALLY REMAINS

01:13:30.172 --> 01:13:31.874
CONSTANT. HAS ENTERED AS ABILITY

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:34.476
MOVEMENT TO. COUNT THAT

01:13:34.543 --> 01:13:35.544
ADDITIONAL HOUSING THAT

01:13:35.611 --> 01:13:36.779
COMMUNITIES ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE

01:13:36.845 --> 01:13:40.082
THOSE STUDENTS. AGAINST THE

01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:51.193
COMMUNITY RINA ALLOCATION. I

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:52.961
BELIEVE THAT THE QUESTION FOR

01:13:53.028 --> 01:13:55.697
CAN DORMITORIES COUNT TOWARDS A

01:13:55.764 --> 01:13:57.833
COMMUNITIES ARENA WELL I THINK

01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.401
THAT'S IT'S A LITTLE MORE

01:13:59.468 --> 01:14:00.836
NUANCED THAN THAT BECAUSE WE ALL

01:14:00.903 --> 01:14:02.571
UNDERSTAND WHAT A DORMITORY IS

01:14:02.638 --> 01:14:04.473
BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN TYPES OF

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:05.574
HOUSING THAT COULD BE

01:14:05.641 --> 01:14:08.677
CONSTRUCTED OFF CAMPUS. WHICH

01:14:08.744 --> 01:14:11.280
MAY OR MAY NOT MEET THE EXISTING

01:14:11.346 --> 01:14:12.581
AT LEAST AS I UNDERSTAND IT

01:14:12.648 --> 01:14:13.715
DEFINITION OF HOUSING THAT

01:14:13.782 --> 01:14:15.851
COUNTS AGAINST RINA STUDENTS MAY

01:14:15.918 --> 01:14:16.819
NEED A DIFFERENT TYPE OF

01:14:16.885 --> 01:14:20.355
HOUSING. THAN SOMEBODY IN THE

01:14:20.422 --> 01:14:22.191
FAMILY WHO WORKS OR OF C. PERSON

01:14:22.257 --> 01:14:24.426
WHO WORKS- WITH OR WITHOUT

01:14:24.493 --> 01:14:26.929
FAMILY. IF IT IS PERMANENT

01:14:26.995 --> 01:14:28.363
HOUSING OFF SITE WORKS

01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:29.898
REPRESENTS A LEASE IT'S ALWAYS

01:14:29.965 --> 01:14:32.000
GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE. TOWARDS A

01:14:32.067 --> 01:14:35.604
RENEWAL. IS IT HAVE TO MATTER

01:14:35.671 --> 01:14:36.338
LOOK. DOES IT HAVE TO HAVE A

01:14:36.405 --> 01:14:38.273
FULL KITCHEN. DOES IT HAVE TO

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:41.276
HAVE COULD HAVE SHARED BATHROOM

01:14:41.343 --> 01:14:43.178
FACILITIES- THOSE ARE LIKE I

01:14:43.245 --> 01:14:45.314
MEAN I THINK THOSE OF THE- CITY

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:46.915
I THINK THOSE ARE THE OBSTACLES

01:14:46.982 --> 01:14:48.717
AT LEAST AS I UNDERSTOOD. THAT

01:14:48.784 --> 01:14:51.086
IT OR UNDERSTAND IT AND MY

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:53.188
QUESTION IS WHERE YOUR STUDENT

01:14:53.255 --> 01:14:55.023
POPULATION IS CONSTANT. FOR

01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:56.325
EXAMPLE THE LARGEST CITY IN

01:14:56.391 --> 01:14:58.227
RIVERSIDE COUNTY. HAS FOR

01:14:58.293 --> 01:14:59.761
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WITHIN

01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:04.333
AS THE CITY LIMITS. SO OBVIOUSLY

01:15:04.399 --> 01:15:05.601
SOMEONE HAS TO PROVIDE THAT

01:15:05.667 --> 01:15:07.269
HOUSING BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITIES

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:09.838
AND COLLEGES ARE UNABLE TO FULLY

01:15:09.905 --> 01:15:11.240
PROVIDED AND WHEN THE COMMUNITY

01:15:11.306 --> 01:15:14.109
DOES. WHICH TAKES UP A LAND

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:16.278
WHICH TAKES OF RESOURCES DOES

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:19.181
THAT HOUSING. KALYAN'S THE

01:15:19.248 --> 01:15:23.619
REALLOCATION. SO JUST A

01:15:23.685 --> 01:15:25.120
CLARIFICATION THE REALLOCATION

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:27.122
IS ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE ZONED

01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:28.557
FOR SO WE'RE EVALUATING HOW-

01:15:28.624 --> 01:15:30.959
HOUSING- IT'S ABOUT WHAT HAS TO

01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:32.461
BE ZONED TO ACCOMMODATE THAT THE

01:15:32.527 --> 01:15:33.795
ULTIMATELY WHAT IS NOT THERE

01:15:33.862 --> 01:15:34.997
WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH

01:15:35.063 --> 01:15:35.831
JURISDICTIONS TO MAKE SURE

01:15:35.898 --> 01:15:39.668
COMPLIANCE- BUT TO BE CLEAR IT'S

01:15:39.735 --> 01:15:41.970
THE ZONING THAT IS REQUIRED SO

01:15:42.037 --> 01:15:43.238
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE HIS OWN

01:15:43.305 --> 01:15:44.840
THAT LAND TO ACCOMMODATE A

01:15:44.907 --> 01:15:46.742
CERTAIN NUMBER OF PARCELS OR

01:15:46.808 --> 01:15:49.177
HOMES- WHEN THEY GET TO THE

01:15:49.244 --> 01:15:50.946
SITE'S INVENTORY IN ORDER TO BE

01:15:51.013 --> 01:15:52.681
COMPLIANT WITH THREE. DAN HOW

01:15:52.748 --> 01:15:53.916
THE NEED THAT REMAINS WHAT

01:15:53.982 --> 01:15:55.584
THEY'RE PERMITTING IS A LITTLE

01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:57.286
BIT OF A SEPARATE PROCESS BUT

01:15:57.352 --> 01:15:58.954
HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

01:15:59.021 --> 01:16:00.155
JURISDICTIONS AS THE KIND OF A

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:01.757
BILL THAT CONTRACT ON THE READ

01:16:01.823 --> 01:16:03.225
IT TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE

01:16:03.292 --> 01:16:03.959
COMPLIANT WELL GOOD I'LL WILL

01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:06.161
FOLLOW UP ON AN ISSUE AND

AS PASSED. A MAJOR DRIVER OF

01:21:04.826 --> 01:21:06.728
HOMELESSNESS IN THE STATE IS THE

01:21:06.795 --> 01:21:08.697
AFFORDABILITY HOUSING CRISIS.

01:21:08.763 --> 01:21:10.098
AND SENSITIVE OVER TIME TO

01:21:10.165 --> 01:21:12.434
BUILDING MORE HOUSING- SO THAT

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.436
PRICES HAVE. COME DOWN ON PRICES

01:21:14.502 --> 01:21:16.071
AS HIGH AS THEY HAVE BEEN IN

01:21:16.137 --> 01:21:17.772
RECENT YEARS WILL BE SORT OF THE

01:21:17.839 --> 01:21:20.141
ROOT- ROOT RESPONSE TO

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:21.309

01:21:25.914 --> 01:21:31.086
ADDRESS THE NEEDS. IMMEDIATE

01:21:31.152 --> 01:21:33.321
BEFORE THE STATE. AND- AS- JUNE

01:21:37.459 --> 01:21:38.460
THAT WILL COME AND FOR. WHICH

01:21:38.526 --> 01:21:40.495
PRO HAVE SORT OF. MOST OF TODAY

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:43.765
AND WILL HAVE GUIDE. TO OVERTURN

01:21:43.832 --> 01:21:45.000
- THE CHALLENGE THAT THERE IS

01:21:45.066 --> 01:21:47.769
LIMITED DATA ON EXACTLY HOW.

01:21:47.836 --> 01:21:49.871
FUNDING HAS BEEN USED- THE

01:21:49.938 --> 01:21:51.539
ADMINISTRATION HAS PRODUCED A

01:21:51.606 --> 01:21:53.241
REPORT ON THE FIRST YEAR. HE

01:21:53.308 --> 01:21:54.976
SPENDING FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:21:55.043 --> 01:21:55.510
NINETEEN AND WE HAVE SOME

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:56.678
INITIAL DATA FROM THE FIRST YEAR

01:21:56.745 --> 01:21:59.147
IT. HAPPENED TWENTY NINETEEN

01:21:59.214 --> 01:22:00.348
TWENTY OF THESE ARE ONLY INITIAL

01:22:00.415 --> 01:22:01.516
ASSESSMENT OF HOW FLEXIBLE

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:03.752
FUNDING. TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:22:03.818 --> 01:22:05.420
HAVE BEEN USED AND WE ALSO KNOW

01:22:05.487 --> 01:22:08.423
THAT. THE STATE HAS MODIFIED

01:22:08.490 --> 01:22:09.291
WHAT'S ABILITY TO LOCAL

01:22:09.357 --> 01:22:10.992
GOVERNMENTS IN RECENT YEARS

01:22:11.059 --> 01:22:12.260
WE'VE TALKED A LOT TODAY ABOUT.

01:22:12.327 --> 01:22:14.062
HAVING MORE LOCAL ACTION PLANS

01:22:14.129 --> 01:22:15.363
THAT ARE SHOULD HAVE ROUTED IT

01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:17.132
IN DATA SO THAT WE CAN TRACK

01:22:17.198 --> 01:22:18.700
ACCOUNTABILITY OVER TIME. IT

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:20.969
WILL TAKE. TAKE TAKE TIME FOR

01:22:21.036 --> 01:22:28.877
OUR- FOR THAT DATA TO BE

01:22:28.943 --> 01:22:29.511
AVAILABLE TO THE STATE. PERFECT

01:22:29.577 --> 01:22:30.412
I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THAT

01:22:30.478 --> 01:22:31.379
THE- COLLECTION THEY DO THAT.

01:22:31.446 --> 01:22:33.248
JUST GATHERING AND ON THAT NOTE

01:22:33.315 --> 01:22:35.917
I DO HOPE THAT- WE DO SOMETHING

01:22:35.984 --> 01:22:38.086
WITH- ANSWERING SENATOR ROBERTS

01:22:38.153 --> 01:22:39.721

01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:43.024
COUPLE YEARS I DID WANNA MENTION

01:22:43.091 --> 01:22:44.092
REALLY QUICK THAT THERE IS A-

01:22:44.159 --> 01:22:45.760

MY DISTRICT THAT HAS BEEN

01:22:47.095 --> 01:22:48.863
INTERESTING JOB THE COST IN

01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:50.632
HOMELESSNESS. IN GETTING PEOPLE

01:22:50.699 --> 01:22:52.600
INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THEN

01:22:52.667 --> 01:22:54.869

PERMANENT HOUSING AND THEY'VE

01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:09.451
BEEN VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL

01:23:09.517 --> 01:23:10.919
SOMETHING THAT WE MIGHT WOULD

01:23:10.985 --> 01:23:13.455
NOT LOOK AS A MODEL- IN OTHER

01:23:13.521 --> 01:23:14.923
PARTS OF THE STATE BUT IT IS MY

OR UP LOADED THE TO THE

01:25:02.831 --> 01:25:04.466
STATEWIDE DATA I THINK IT'S AN

01:25:04.532 --> 01:25:05.867
IMPORTANT QUESTION TO UNDERSTAND

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:08.136
AS WE- CONTINUE TO TRY TO

01:25:08.203 --> 01:25:10.805
DETERMINE. WHERE THE INVESTMENT

01:25:10.872 --> 01:25:14.876
SHOULD GO IN IN TERMS OF- OF THE

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:15.376

TO HIS OWN HOME TURF BUT I THINK

01:25:38.666 --> 01:25:40.635
THE REAL ISSUE IS- IF WE DON'T

01:25:40.702 --> 01:25:42.170

01:25:42.237 --> 01:25:44.539

01:25:44.606 --> 01:25:46.241
THAT WE SHOULD BE GATHERING THAT

01:25:46.307 --> 01:25:47.342

01:31:32.086 --> 01:31:33.921
NONE FOR SHELTER IT'S VERY

01:31:33.988 --> 01:31:35.690
TYPICAL OF OTHER COUNTIES IN THE

01:31:35.756 --> 01:31:38.125
BAY AREA ALAMEDA. A TO SOME

01:31:38.192 --> 01:31:40.895
DEGREE SAN FRANCISCO- SIX YEARS

01:31:40.962 --> 01:31:43.664
LATER WE'VE GOT FORTY FOUR

01:31:43.731 --> 01:31:44.932
HUNDRED PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE

01:31:44.999 --> 01:31:47.301
HOUSING UNITS- AND THERE'S MORE

01:31:47.368 --> 01:31:49.170
IN THE PIPELINE SO THAT MONEY IS

01:31:49.237 --> 01:31:50.304
WORKING FOR FROM THIS BOARD OF

01:31:50.371 --> 01:31:52.373
HOUSING SIX YEARS LATER OUR

01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:54.809
UNSHELTERED POPULATION IS OVER

01:31:54.876 --> 01:31:56.110
TEN THOUSAND IT'S INCREASED NOT

01:31:56.177 --> 01:31:59.046
DECREASED. IN ITS FROM OF A

01:31:59.113 --> 01:32:00.781
PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY STANDPOINT

01:32:00.848 --> 01:32:03.050
IT'S NOT WORKING BECAUSE PEOPLE

01:32:03.117 --> 01:32:05.186
ARE ARE PAYING THE BOND. BUT THE

01:32:05.253 --> 01:32:09.123
DRIVE TO WORK AND SEE. UP MORE

01:32:09.190 --> 01:32:11.559
TENSE MORE A SHELTERED IN EIGHT

01:32:11.626 --> 01:32:12.894
EIGHT I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:16.497
THAT. WHATEVER THE RADIUS OF THE

01:32:16.564 --> 01:32:18.599
RATIO OF DOLLARS AT THE STATE

01:32:18.666 --> 01:32:20.301
LEVEL BETWEEN NINE CHILDREN

01:32:20.368 --> 01:32:22.637
PERMITS SUPPORT OF HOUSING. IS

01:32:22.703 --> 01:32:24.038
NOT ALLEVIATING THAT PROBLEM AT

01:32:24.105 --> 01:32:26.007
A LOCAL LEVEL AND IT'S CREATING

01:32:26.073 --> 01:32:27.308
SEVERE BACKLASH IN OUR

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:30.011
COMMUNITIES SO. YOU KNOW YOU

01:32:30.077 --> 01:32:32.079
COULD ARGUE THAT I'VE BEEN PART

01:32:32.146 --> 01:32:33.481
OF THE PROBLEM BECAUSE I PUT

01:32:33.547 --> 01:32:34.815
UPON TOGETHER THAT WAS ONLY FOR

01:32:34.882 --> 01:32:37.752
FROM SUPPORT OF HOUSING- BUT

01:32:37.818 --> 01:32:39.854
THERE'S ALWAYS TIME TO CORRECT.

01:32:39.921 --> 01:32:41.422
THEY MAKE COURSE CORRECTIONS IN

01:32:41.489 --> 01:32:42.290
THAT SO THAT'S ALL I'M

01:32:42.356 --> 01:32:44.058
SUGGESTING AT THIS POINT BEFORE

THIS SMART THING TO DO- AS A AS

01:39:04.271 --> 01:39:05.339
A BUILDER BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

01:39:05.406 --> 01:39:07.708

BRING THE RETAIL AND- AND THE

02:19:54.719 --> 02:19:59.524

THOSE RESOURCES I KNOW THERE IS

A SET ASIDE FOR RURAL

02:20:18.576 --> 02:20:20.078
COMMUNITIES WE MIGHT WANT TO

02:20:20.145 --> 02:20:22.213
LOOK AT THAT AND INCREASE THE

02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:23.414
PERCENTAGE JUST TO MAKE SURE

02:20:23.481 --> 02:20:25.116

ABLE TO ACCESS SOME OF THOSE

02:20:35.293 --> 02:20:37.095
FUNDS- MY- THOSE THAT THOSE ARE

02:20:37.162 --> 02:20:38.763
JUST STATEMENTS MY FIRST COURT

02:20:38.830 --> 02:20:44.402
MIKE MY QUESTION IS ON. THE-

02:20:44.469 --> 02:20:46.204
WHAT WHAT KIND OF INVESTMENTS

02:20:46.271 --> 02:20:47.739
SHOULD THE SENATE BE CONSIDERING

02:20:47.806 --> 02:20:50.575
IN ORDER TO BUILD. UPON RECENT

02:20:50.642 --> 02:20:52.577
INVESTMENTS TO AND THEN PREVENT

02:20:52.644 --> 02:20:54.345
HOMELESSNESS AND TO PROVIDE MORE

02:20:54.412 --> 02:20:56.181
CERTAINTY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:20:56.247 --> 02:20:57.315
DEVELOPERS SO WE KNOW WE NEED TO

02:20:57.382 --> 02:21:00.084
BUILD. HOUSING THAT IS

02:21:00.151 --> 02:21:03.021
AFFORDABLE. AS WELL AS DEAL WITH

02:21:03.087 --> 02:21:05.156
THE HOMELESS POPULATION. BUT

02:21:05.223 --> 02:21:06.858
WHAT WHAT SHOULD WE BE FOCUSING

02:21:06.925 --> 02:21:09.093
ON IN TERMS OF THE OUR FUNDS AND

02:21:09.160 --> 02:21:10.428
I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES IS DO

02:21:10.495 --> 02:21:12.397
WE START SOMETHING NEW OR DO WE

02:21:12.463 --> 02:21:14.799
GO BACK AND- MAKE SURE THAT THE

02:21:14.866 --> 02:21:16.768
RESOURCES THAT WE PUT OUT THERE.

02:21:16.835 --> 02:21:18.636
THAT THERE'S RESOURCES THAT ARE

02:21:18.703 --> 02:21:20.905
CONTINUING. TO FOLLOW IN THOSE

02:21:20.972 --> 02:21:22.240
IN THOSE CATEGORIES SO YOU

02:21:22.307 --> 02:21:25.376
HAVEN'T- ANYONE ANYONE ON THE

02:21:25.443 --> 02:21:34.452
PANEL THAT CAN ANSWER THAT. WHY

02:21:34.519 --> 02:21:35.787
DON'T I START AND THEN MAYBE

02:21:35.854 --> 02:21:38.590
OTHERS CAN JOIN IN. I WOULD-

02:21:38.656 --> 02:21:39.891
THERE ARE A MYRIAD OF FUNDING

02:21:39.958 --> 02:21:41.459
OPPORTUNITIES AND WHAT I WOULD

02:21:41.526 --> 02:21:42.694
STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO

02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:44.395
CONSIDER AS YOU DELIBERATE THIS

02:21:44.462 --> 02:21:47.465
YEAR'S BUDGET IS. AN ON GOING

02:21:47.532 --> 02:21:49.300
SUSTAINABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING

02:21:49.367 --> 02:21:51.269
FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS. AND THEN

02:21:51.336 --> 02:21:54.339
CONTINUE TO INVEST IN FUNDING

02:21:54.405 --> 02:21:56.774
THAT HELPS- MATCHED OUR LOCAL

02:21:56.841 --> 02:21:59.244
FUNDS TO OFFSET THE COST OF

02:21:59.310 --> 02:22:01.179
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THOSE ARE THE

02:22:01.246 --> 02:22:03.047
TWO AREAS. AND YOU CAN DO THAT

02:22:03.114 --> 02:22:06.017
BY FUNDING- CREATING THESE ONE

02:22:06.084 --> 02:22:06.551
TIME POTS OF MONEY EITHER

02:22:06.618 --> 02:22:09.254
THROUGH KEEP SASH OR READ AS AN

02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:10.722
ONGOING ALLOCATION THROUGH THE

02:22:10.788 --> 02:22:13.558
COCS AND COUNTIES. OR YOU YOU

02:22:13.625 --> 02:22:15.226
CAN REIMAGINE AND DIED BUT I

02:22:15.293 --> 02:22:16.861
WILL JUST GO SOME OF WHAT THE

02:22:16.928 --> 02:22:18.162
OTHER TWO SPEAKERS BEFORE ME AND

02:22:18.229 --> 02:22:20.398
SAID. WE NEED TO TRANSITION OUT

02:22:20.465 --> 02:22:21.599
OF ONE TIME FUNDING INTO

02:22:21.666 --> 02:22:23.301
SUSTAINABLE FUNDING WE'RE

02:22:23.368 --> 02:22:25.737
CREATING THE SYSTEMS OF CARE AND

02:22:25.803 --> 02:22:27.171
WITH THE ONE TIME INVESTMENT

02:22:27.238 --> 02:22:28.539
THAT WE RECEIVED WE HAVE

02:22:28.606 --> 02:22:29.908
APPROXIMATELY A MILLION DOLLARS

02:22:29.974 --> 02:22:31.576
LEFT WHICH MEANS IN A YEAR. AND

02:22:31.643 --> 02:22:33.311
A YEAR TO TWO YEARS WILL RUN OUT

02:22:33.378 --> 02:22:34.879
OF MONEY TO SUPPORT THESE

02:22:34.946 --> 02:22:36.381
HUNDRED A HUNDRED AND NINETY BED

02:22:36.447 --> 02:22:37.815
SET UP IN CREATED IN OUR COUNTY.

02:22:37.882 --> 02:22:39.317
WE'RE REALLY STRUGGLING WITH

02:22:39.384 --> 02:22:41.152
SUSTAINABILITY BECAUSE A LOT OF

02:22:41.219 --> 02:22:43.021
THE FUNDS WERE USING LOCALLY ARE

02:22:43.087 --> 02:22:44.722
ONE TIME. ON THE CONSTRUCTION

02:22:44.789 --> 02:22:46.224
SIDE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING ONE

02:22:46.291 --> 02:22:48.393
TIME FUNDING WORKS WELL ONCE WE

02:22:48.459 --> 02:22:49.694
GET THINGS UP AND MOVING WE CAN

02:22:49.761 --> 02:22:51.829
FIGURE OUT THE SUSTAINABILITY.

02:22:51.896 --> 02:22:53.197
OF THOSE PROJECTS THAT'S WHAT

02:22:53.264 --> 02:22:55.333
THE LOCALS HAVE- THAT'S WHAT

02:22:55.400 --> 02:22:56.734
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO UNLOCK THE

02:22:56.801 --> 02:22:58.069
POTENTIAL OF WITH A DOCTOR TO

02:22:58.136 --> 02:22:59.671
FEE REDUCTION PROGRAM. THAT WAS

02:22:59.737 --> 02:23:00.939
JUST DONE LAST MONTH SO WE'RE

02:23:01.005 --> 02:23:02.740
WE'RE GOING INTO THE ABILITY OF

02:23:02.807 --> 02:23:04.609
BEING MORE ADVANTAGEOUS WITH ONE

02:23:04.676 --> 02:23:05.710
TIME FUNDING BUT IF YOU'RE

02:23:05.777 --> 02:23:07.412
LOOKING AT PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE-

02:23:07.478 --> 02:23:09.580
SERVICES AND HOUSING. THOSE ARE

02:23:09.647 --> 02:23:14.819
THINGS THAT WE REALLY. NEED TO

02:23:14.886 --> 02:23:15.920
FOCUS TO STAND ABILITY EFFORTS

02:23:15.987 --> 02:23:17.355
ON. VERY GOOD- I CONDITION IN AS

02:23:17.422 --> 02:23:18.456
- I THINK IT AN AXLE QUESTION I

02:23:18.523 --> 02:23:21.693
I'D THINK THAT IN TERMS OF- BIG

02:23:21.759 --> 02:23:24.696
BANG FOR BACK HOUSING SUBSIDIES

02:23:24.762 --> 02:23:26.331
IS A REALLY GOOD WAY TO GO TO

02:23:26.397 --> 02:23:27.865
PREVENT PEOPLE FROM BECOMING

02:23:27.932 --> 02:23:29.567
HOMELESS AND REALLY TARGETING

02:23:29.634 --> 02:23:31.703
THOSE SUBSIDIES. THE PEOPLE MOST

02:23:31.769 --> 02:23:34.572
LIKELY TO BECOME HOMELESS- AT

02:23:34.639 --> 02:23:36.607
ASSEMBLY MEMBER SYRIAN IS GOING

02:23:36.674 --> 02:23:38.509
TO BE INTRODUCING A BILL THAT

02:23:38.576 --> 02:23:42.046
WILL. OFFER PREVENTION RESOURCES

02:23:42.113 --> 02:23:43.881
TO OLDER ADULTS WHO ARE AT RISK

02:23:43.948 --> 02:23:45.750
OF BECOMING HOMELESS. AND WE

02:23:45.817 --> 02:23:46.985
HAVE SEEN STUDIES AT OF SAN

02:23:47.051 --> 02:23:49.220
DIEGO THAT. SOME OLDER ADULTS

02:23:49.287 --> 02:23:50.922
JUST NEED TWO OR THREE HUNDRED

02:23:50.989 --> 02:23:53.057
DOLLARS A MONTH. TO MAINTAIN

02:23:53.124 --> 02:23:55.226
THEIR HOUSING THAT WITHOUT THAT

02:23:55.293 --> 02:23:57.362
FUNDING WITHOUT THAT MONEY THAT

02:23:57.428 --> 02:23:59.130
YOU KNOW AT TWO THREE HUNDRED

02:23:59.197 --> 02:24:00.431
DOLLARS A MONTH THEY ME. THEY

02:24:00.498 --> 02:24:01.899
ARE LIKELY TO BECOME HOMELESS

02:24:01.966 --> 02:24:04.268
AND SO. I DO THINK THAT IS ONE

02:24:04.335 --> 02:24:08.206
PIECE TO KEEP IN MIND AND TO. TO

02:24:08.272 --> 02:24:10.241
TO FIND I DO THINK THAT THAT

02:24:10.308 --> 02:24:11.709
PROBABLY DOES REQUIRE A NEW

02:24:11.776 --> 02:24:14.212
PROGRAM- JUST BECAUSE- NONE OF

02:24:14.278 --> 02:24:15.713
OUR EXISTING PROGRAMS REALLY

02:24:15.780 --> 02:24:19.350
LOOK AT. PREVENTION AND REALLY

02:24:19.417 --> 02:24:21.652
FOCUS RESOURCES ON PREVENTION-

02:24:21.719 --> 02:24:24.622
I'M IN A TARGETED WAY- BUT I DO

02:24:24.689 --> 02:24:26.290
AGREE COMPLETELY WITH STEPHANIE

02:24:26.357 --> 02:24:29.160
THE OTHER- THE OTHER PIECES THAT

02:24:29.227 --> 02:24:30.762
SHE MENTIONED I THINK ARE ALSO

02:24:30.828 --> 02:24:35.333
CREDIT. THE KEEPING. IN MIND

02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:36.367
WHEN IT COMES TO PREVENTION. IF

02:24:36.434 --> 02:24:39.003
I AM I ADD A THOUGHT FROM THAT

02:24:39.070 --> 02:24:40.972
PERSPECTIVE OF THAT FOR MANY.

02:24:41.039 --> 02:24:43.007
ONGOING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN

02:24:43.074 --> 02:24:45.009
THE DELIVERY OF THAT HOUSING I

02:24:45.076 --> 02:24:47.345
YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S THERE. IS

02:24:47.412 --> 02:24:48.913
I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH THE

02:24:48.980 --> 02:24:50.348
IMPORTANCE OF A STABLE ONGOING

02:24:50.415 --> 02:24:52.283
SOURCE OF FUNDS THAT STREET FOR

02:24:52.350 --> 02:24:53.885
OPERATING SUBSIDY AND SERVICE

02:24:53.951 --> 02:24:55.453
DOLLARS BUT IT IS TRUE FOR THE

02:24:55.520 --> 02:24:56.788
CAPITAL PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE

02:24:56.854 --> 02:24:58.189
USING TO DELIVER THE HOUSING

02:24:58.256 --> 02:25:00.258
BECAUSE- THE FEAST OR FAMINE OR

02:25:00.324 --> 02:25:01.993
THE NEW PROGRAM AND JUST STATE

02:25:02.060 --> 02:25:03.294
THAT BROKE. THAT DEVELOPMENTS

02:25:03.361 --> 02:25:05.196
TAKE A VERY VERY LONG TIME THEY

02:25:05.263 --> 02:25:06.330
GET STRUCTURED AND THEN IF

02:25:06.397 --> 02:25:07.899
THERE'S A CHANGE THAT AND IT'S

02:25:07.965 --> 02:25:10.334
VERY INEFFICIENT AS THEY SIT AND

02:25:10.401 --> 02:25:11.702
WAIT OR THEY ARE RESTRUCTURED

02:25:11.769 --> 02:25:13.738
SO. HAVING PROGRAMS THAT ARE

02:25:13.805 --> 02:25:15.573
FUNDED ON A CONSISTENT ONGOING

02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:17.508
BASIS IS REALLY REALLY HELPFUL

02:25:17.575 --> 02:25:18.776
WILL TAKE WILL TAKE ALL

02:25:18.843 --> 02:25:20.144
SOLUTIONS ALSO LESIONS ARE

02:25:20.211 --> 02:25:21.913
WELCOME OF COURSE BUT THESE

02:25:21.979 --> 02:25:23.081
PROGRAMS THAT ARE ABOUT TO

02:25:23.147 --> 02:25:25.450
EXPIRE OR THESE PROGRAMS THAT

02:25:25.516 --> 02:25:27.185
ONE TIME ONLY IF THEY CAN BE

02:25:27.251 --> 02:25:28.352
RENEWED I THINK THAT WOULD BE

02:25:28.419 --> 02:25:32.690
VERY VERY HELPFUL FOR THAT. FOR

02:25:32.757 --> 02:25:33.257
THE INDUSTRY DELIVERING THE

02:25:33.324 --> 02:25:34.525
HOUSING. WHAT YOU FOR THAT AND I

02:25:34.592 --> 02:25:35.426
APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS BECAUSE

02:25:35.493 --> 02:25:37.895
WHEN WE- WHEN WE ESTABLISHED A

02:25:37.962 --> 02:25:40.131
NEW FUND. THEN THE PARAMETERS OF

02:25:40.198 --> 02:25:41.799
THE FUND HAVE TO BE DEVELOPED

02:25:41.866 --> 02:25:43.768
AND THAT TAKES TIME. AND IT

02:25:43.835 --> 02:25:45.069
MEANS EVERYBODY'S GOT A SHIFT

02:25:45.136 --> 02:25:47.171
AND- I'M- PART OF WHAT I'M

02:25:47.238 --> 02:25:49.006
CONCERNED ABOUT IS I'VE HEARD

02:25:49.073 --> 02:25:50.741
OVER THE YEARS THAT THE I. G. IN

02:25:50.808 --> 02:25:52.877
THIS AND THE- AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:25:52.944 --> 02:25:54.245
SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY PROGRAM

02:25:54.312 --> 02:25:55.713
DOESN'T WORK REALLY WELL AND

HOUSING. THE MOST THAT WAS GOOD

02:30:46.504 --> 02:30:48.339
THE MISTAKE WAS NOT TO HAVE A

02:30:48.406 --> 02:30:50.341
GREATER OR GREATER OR EQUAL

02:30:50.408 --> 02:30:53.711
INVESTMENT. IN SHELTER TO GET US

02:30:53.778 --> 02:30:56.981

02:30:57.047 --> 02:30:58.716
ILLUSTRATION I COULD GIVE OF

02:30:58.783 --> 02:31:01.218
WHAT I'M SAYING THAT GOES BACK

02:31:01.285 --> 02:31:02.453
TO THE EARLIER COMMENTS- BY THE

02:31:02.520 --> 02:31:06.023
PRESENTER. WAS THIS- IN THE

02:31:06.090 --> 02:31:08.692
STATEMENT I BELIEVE WAS THAT. WE

02:31:08.759 --> 02:31:09.627
NEED THE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE

02:31:09.693 --> 02:31:12.062
HOUSING SO THAT WE CAN TAKE THE

02:31:12.129 --> 02:31:15.032
SHELTERS AND USE THEM AS FEEDERS

02:31:15.099 --> 02:31:15.566
INTO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE

02:31:15.633 --> 02:31:19.303
HOUSING. WE DON'T HAVE SHELTERS

02:31:19.370 --> 02:31:22.440
OUR FEEDERS ARE NOT SHELTERS- IN

02:31:22.506 --> 02:31:23.474
I CAN'T SPEAK FOR EVERY COUNTY

02:31:23.541 --> 02:31:25.342
IN THE STATE- BUT I CERTAINLY

02:31:25.409 --> 02:31:26.877
BELIEVE ARE COUNTY IS SOME TO

02:31:26.944 --> 02:31:28.078
SOME DEGREE A MICROCOSM OF

02:31:28.145 --> 02:31:30.881
WHAT'S OCCURRING- WE'RE TRYING

02:31:30.948 --> 02:31:33.884
TO USE CREEKS. UNDERPASSES

02:31:33.951 --> 02:31:35.820
SIDEWALKS AS FEEDERS INTO A

02:31:35.886 --> 02:31:36.687
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING

02:31:36.754 --> 02:31:38.756
SYSTEM THAT TAKES YEARS AND

02:31:38.823 --> 02:31:40.991
YEARS THE TO BUILD AND DEVELOP

02:31:41.058 --> 02:31:43.427
IN IN IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT AN

02:31:43.494 --> 02:31:45.629
ACCEPTABLE STRATEGY WITH THE

02:31:45.696 --> 02:31:47.731
CONSTITUENTS THAT WE REPRESENT.

02:31:47.798 --> 02:31:50.034
IF YOU WERE TO FLY INTO MINETA

02:31:50.100 --> 02:31:51.268

INTERNATIONAL. TO TAKE A TOUR OF

02:31:57.074 --> 02:31:58.976
THE SHELTER PROGRAM IN SANTA

02:31:59.043 --> 02:32:01.245
CLARA COUNTY OR IN SAN JOSE YOU

02:32:01.312 --> 02:32:04.181

AREA OF THE AIRPORT YOU CAN GET

02:32:06.650 --> 02:32:07.718
RIGHT BACK ON THE PLANE LEAVE

02:32:07.785 --> 02:32:10.955
BECAUSE THE SHELTER PROGRAM IS

02:32:11.021 --> 02:32:11.689
SOMETHING CALLED THE GUADALUPE

02:32:11.755 --> 02:32:15.025
CREEK. OR RIVER WHICH RUNS RIGHT

02:32:15.092 --> 02:32:17.094
NEXT TO THE AIRPORT. IN I WAS IN

02:32:17.161 --> 02:32:19.363
NEW YORK- NOT SO LONG AGO WHERE

02:32:19.430 --> 02:32:21.565
THEY DO BOTH AND THEY MAKE AN

02:32:21.632 --> 02:32:25.569
EQUAL INVESTMENT IN SHELTER. AND

02:32:25.636 --> 02:32:27.771
OFTENTIMES SIDE BY SIDE. SOON

02:32:27.838 --> 02:32:30.107
SHELTER THOSE WHO WERE SHELTERED

02:32:30.174 --> 02:32:31.408

02:32:31.475 --> 02:32:33.644
NEXT- WHAT THE GOAL IS THE

02:32:33.711 --> 02:32:35.112
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING

A SHELTER FEEDER PROGRAM- THAT

02:32:56.634 --> 02:32:57.334
FEEDS INTO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE

02:32:57.401 --> 02:33:00.271
HOUSING- WE IN CALIFORNIA THUS

02:33:00.337 --> 02:33:05.142

HOUSING AGAIN IS A GREAT THING-

02:33:27.431 --> 02:33:30.501
BUT IN THE FOUR TO FIVE TO SIX

02:33:30.568 --> 02:33:32.903
YEARS OR MORE THAT IT'S GOING TO

THOSE FOLKS ARE GONNA SURVIVE IN

02:33:36.373 --> 02:33:37.908
ALL I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THAT'S

02:33:37.975 --> 02:33:39.543
UNACCEPTABLE TO THE CONSTITUENTS

02:33:54.358 --> 02:33:57.428
THINK THIS. ALGORITHM OF MOVING

02:33:57.494 --> 02:33:58.829
THE FOLKS FROM SHELTER INCOMES

02:33:58.896 --> 02:34:01.398
WERE OF HOUSING WILL WORK AS AS

02:34:01.465 --> 02:34:04.401
A NICE SMOOTH OPERATION. BUT IT

02:34:04.468 --> 02:34:05.402
WASN'T ME IT WAS ONE OF THE

02:34:05.469 --> 02:34:07.638
PRESENTERS WHO SAID. THE PROBLEM

02:34:07.705 --> 02:34:10.007
IS THAT WE'RE BEING OVERWHELMED-

02:34:10.074 --> 02:34:12.876
BY HELLO FOLKS FALLING INTO

02:34:12.943 --> 02:34:15.145
HOMELESSNESS QUOTE ON QUOTE- AND

02:34:15.212 --> 02:34:16.146
THAT'S WHY OUR PERMITS FOR

02:34:16.213 --> 02:34:17.581
HOUSING INVESTMENT IS IN KEEPING

02:34:17.648 --> 02:34:20.351
UP ON. WELL WE NEED TO SHELTER

02:34:20.417 --> 02:34:21.051
THEM WITH THE PHONE INTO

02:34:21.118 --> 02:34:25.222
HOMELESSNESS- WE CAN'T SAY.

02:34:25.289 --> 02:34:26.957
DON'T WORRY- WE'RE GOING TO

02:34:27.024 --> 02:34:27.992
PREVENT OTHERS FROM BECOMING

02:34:28.058 --> 02:34:30.527
LIKE YOU. THEY'RE ALREADY IN

02:34:30.594 --> 02:34:31.729
HOMELESS SISTERS IN A WAY TO.

02:34:31.795 --> 02:34:33.864
PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING. IN

02:34:33.931 --> 02:34:36.166
AND IT'S A HUGE NUMBER AND IT'S

02:34:36.233 --> 02:34:38.636
BECOMING- I THINK THE BIGGEST

02:34:38.702 --> 02:34:40.004
POLITICAL LIGHTNING ROD IN THE

02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:41.805
STATE RIGHT NOW SO. FOR WHATEVER

02:34:41.872 --> 02:34:43.941
THAT'S WORTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH

02:34:44.008 --> 02:34:46.610
GIVE MANAGER. SENATOR WHETHER IT

02:34:46.677 --> 02:34:50.280
BE ABLE TO RESPOND. SURE THANK

02:34:50.347 --> 02:34:53.417
YOU- THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR I

02:34:53.484 --> 02:34:55.386
AGREE WITH A LOT OF WHAT YOU

02:34:55.452 --> 02:34:57.421
SAID I DO THINK IT IS BOTH AND

02:34:57.488 --> 02:34:59.657
WE DO NEED MORE WHAT I WOULD

02:34:59.723 --> 02:35:01.058
CALL INTERIM OPTIONS WHICH COULD

02:35:01.125 --> 02:35:03.360
BE A SHELTER COULD BE MOTEL STAY

02:35:03.427 --> 02:35:07.431
OR OR OTHER OPTIONS OUT THERE-

02:35:07.498 --> 02:35:09.366
AT THE SAME TIME I JUST WANT TO

02:35:09.433 --> 02:35:10.968
CLARIFY SOME OF MY COMMENTS I

02:35:11.035 --> 02:35:13.037
ACTUALLY THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT

02:35:13.103 --> 02:35:14.972
SOMETIMES BUILDING NEW HOUSING

02:35:15.039 --> 02:35:18.709
TAKES A LONG TIME. AND WE NEED A

02:35:18.776 --> 02:35:21.445
STRATEGY THAT ALSO INCLUDES

02:35:21.512 --> 02:35:23.047
HOUSING SUBSIDIES AND WITH

02:35:23.113 --> 02:35:24.815
HOUSING SUBSIDIES WE CAN

02:35:24.882 --> 02:35:26.050
ACTUALLY GET PEOPLE HOUSE WITH

02:35:26.116 --> 02:35:28.786
MUCH MORE QUICKLY I DON'T THINK

02:35:28.852 --> 02:35:31.622
IT'S YOU KNOW ONE VERSUS THE

02:35:31.689 --> 02:35:34.024
OTHER IT IS ALL OF THOSE IN OUR

02:35:34.091 --> 02:35:36.360
LOCAL SYSTEMS WE NEED A BALANCED

02:35:36.427 --> 02:35:38.195
APPROACH IF WE HAVE LOTS OF

02:35:38.262 --> 02:35:40.364
SHELTER BEDS OR LOTS OF INTERIM

02:35:40.431 --> 02:35:42.633
OPTIONS AND NOW HOUSING FOR

02:35:42.700 --> 02:35:44.935
PEOPLE WHO GO TO WE'RE GOING TO

02:35:45.002 --> 02:35:46.804
HAVE TO KEEP BUILDING MORE AND

02:35:46.870 --> 02:35:48.772
MORE SHELTER BEDS AND I THINK

02:35:48.839 --> 02:35:49.373
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO

02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:51.909
CLARIFY- THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE AN

02:35:51.975 --> 02:35:54.144
EXIT STRATEGY FROM THE SHELTERS

02:35:54.211 --> 02:35:56.580
TO. THE PERMANENT HOUSING AND

02:35:56.647 --> 02:35:57.981
WHETHER THAT'S AFFORDABLE

02:35:58.048 --> 02:35:59.750
BECAUSE NOT I DIDN'T BELIEVE

02:35:59.817 --> 02:36:01.885
THAT NOT EVERYBODY NEEDS SUPPORT

02:36:01.952 --> 02:36:03.153
OF HOUSING SOME PEOPLE NEED

02:36:03.220 --> 02:36:04.855
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT THEY

02:36:04.922 --> 02:36:06.724
DON'T NEED THE SERVICES THAT GO

02:36:06.790 --> 02:36:09.293
ALONG WITH SUPPORTIVE HOUSING-

02:36:09.359 --> 02:36:11.562
SO I THINK WE NEED MORE OF A

02:36:11.628 --> 02:36:12.663
BALANCED APPROACH IN SOME

02:36:12.730 --> 02:36:14.231
COMMUNITIES ALL WE HAVE IS

02:36:14.298 --> 02:36:16.900
SHELTERS IN SOME COMMUNITIES WE

02:36:16.967 --> 02:36:19.436
HAVE VERY FEW TO NO SHELTER OR

02:36:19.503 --> 02:36:22.272
ENSURING HOUSING OPTIONS SO I

02:36:22.339 --> 02:36:24.141
AGREE WITH YOU WE NEED A BOTH

02:36:24.208 --> 02:36:27.044
AND STRATEGY AND GETTING PEOPLE

02:36:27.111 --> 02:36:29.079
HOUSE QUICKLY MEANS BOTH

02:36:29.146 --> 02:36:31.381
BUILDING TO INCREASE THE HOUSING

02:36:31.448 --> 02:36:33.584
STOCK AS WELL AS HOUSING

02:36:33.650 --> 02:36:35.252
SUBSIDIES TO GET PEOPLE HOUSED

02:36:35.319 --> 02:36:37.521
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND THE

02:36:37.588 --> 02:36:39.623
MORE HOUSING WE HAVE THE FEWER

02:36:39.690 --> 02:36:42.126
SHELTER BEDS WE NEED THE PROBLEM

02:36:42.192 --> 02:36:43.994
WITH SHELTERS AND SOMETIMES IF

02:36:44.061 --> 02:36:48.465
YOU BUILD A LOT. OF SHELTERS AND

02:36:48.532 --> 02:36:50.400
YOU DON'T HAVE. GOAL X. AND-

02:36:50.467 --> 02:36:51.735
HOUSING IT MEANS PEOPLE STAYING

02:36:51.802 --> 02:36:53.370
THE SHELTER FOR NINE TO TWELVE

02:36:53.437 --> 02:36:54.538
MONTHS WHICH IS VERY COMMON IN

02:36:54.605 --> 02:36:56.774
OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND SO

02:36:56.840 --> 02:36:58.175
AGAIN THEN YOU HAVE TO BUILD

02:36:58.242 --> 02:37:00.244
MORE SHELTERS IN PLACES LIKE NEW

02:37:00.310 --> 02:37:02.146
YORK THAT HAVE A RIGHT TO

02:37:02.212 --> 02:37:05.382
SHELTER- UNFORTUNATELY THEY FIND

02:37:05.449 --> 02:37:07.251
THAT THEY HAVE TO SPEND MORE AND

02:37:07.317 --> 02:37:09.453
MORE MONEY EVERY YEAR. TO KEEP

02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:10.954
PACE WITH THAT RIGHT SHELTER

02:37:11.021 --> 02:37:12.422
BECAUSE NONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO

02:37:12.489 --> 02:37:13.657
WERE LIVING IN SHELTERS ARE

02:37:13.724 --> 02:37:15.959
EXTREMELY PERMANENT HOUSING. SO

02:37:16.026 --> 02:37:17.261
WE SEE IN THE YORK SOME PEOPLE

02:37:17.327 --> 02:37:18.629
ARE LIVING IN THE SHELTERS FOR

02:37:18.695 --> 02:37:21.098
UP TO THREE YEARS. SO WE YOU

02:37:21.165 --> 02:37:22.966
KNOW I THINK WE HAVE TO. REALLY

02:37:23.033 --> 02:37:25.135
LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE STRATEGIES

02:37:25.202 --> 02:37:27.371
AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

02:37:27.437 --> 02:37:29.606
PROMOTING A BALANCED APPROACH

02:37:29.673 --> 02:37:31.375
I'M IN LOS ANGELES THEY'VE-

02:37:31.441 --> 02:37:34.444
THEY'VE IDENTIFIED THAT WE NEED

02:37:34.511 --> 02:37:35.045
FOUR TO FIVE PERMANENT HOUSING

02:37:35.112 --> 02:37:38.248
SLOTS. FOR EVERY SHELTER BED IN

02:37:38.315 --> 02:37:40.684
THE BAY AREA I THINK IT'S MORE

02:37:40.751 --> 02:37:43.220
OF LIKE- WHEN SHELTER BED. TO

02:37:43.287 --> 02:37:44.822
PERMANENT HOUSING SITES AND OR
