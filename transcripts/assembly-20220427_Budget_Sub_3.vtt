00:48:59.136 --> 00:49:00.637
WOULD ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM SO

00:49:00.704 --> 00:49:02.372
FOR EXAMPLE. PART OF THIS

00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:03.540
PACKAGE IS A HUNDRED MILLION

INCREASE THE C. R. V. VALUE FOR-

00:49:12.816 --> 00:49:14.017

CONTAINERS THEY WERE PURCHASED

00:49:17.688 --> 00:49:19.589
OVER THAT PANDEMIC AND THEY JUST

00:49:19.656 --> 00:49:21.291
HAVEN'T RETURNED THEM YET AND SO

00:49:21.358 --> 00:49:22.359
THAT INCREASED CRP WHAT KIND OF

00:49:22.426 --> 00:49:24.227
ENCOURAGE THAT. REDEMPTION OF

00:49:24.294 --> 00:49:26.797
THOSE CONTAINERS- AND ARGUE IT'S

00:49:26.863 --> 00:49:28.699
NOT REALLY CLEAR THERE HASN'T

00:49:28.765 --> 00:49:30.300

CONTAINER- THAT PURCHASED AND M.

00:49:37.407 --> 00:49:39.576
ANY IF THEY ARE IT'S UNCLEAR HOW

00:49:39.643 --> 00:49:41.678
THE KIND OF TEMP. INCREASE IN

00:49:41.745 --> 00:49:42.746
THE C. R. V. VALUE- WOULD

00:49:42.813 --> 00:49:43.413
ENCOURAGE REDEMPTION THAT WOULD

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:44.848
NOT A NOT HAVE OTHERWISE

00:49:44.915 --> 00:49:46.683
OCCURRED SO FOR EXAMPLE IF

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:48.385

00:49:52.122 --> 00:49:53.690
TO REDEEM THEM AT SOME POINT

00:49:53.757 --> 00:49:55.425
AND- THE TEMPORARY INCREASE IN

00:49:55.492 --> 00:49:56.860
THE C. R. V. COULD ESSENTIALLY

00:49:56.927 --> 00:49:58.729
JUST SORT OF SHIFT THE TIMING ON

00:49:58.795 --> 00:50:00.597

ARE RECYCLED. RUN SECOND.

00:50:05.869 --> 00:50:06.503
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS HOW

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:08.238
EFFECTIVE ARE THE PROPOSALS AT A

00:50:08.305 --> 00:50:09.339

00:51:43.533 --> 00:51:45.836
PROPOSALS- HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO

00:51:45.902 --> 00:51:47.370

INCREASING CRP VALUES- WE THINK

00:52:06.656 --> 00:52:08.391
ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE HAVE

00:52:08.458 --> 00:52:09.759

ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE

HAS. DIRECTOR YOUR- THE PROPOSAL

00:53:52.062 --> 00:53:53.863
IS BASED ON- THE FACT THAT

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:55.332
THERE'S THIS EXTRA MONEY IN THE

00:53:55.398 --> 00:53:57.367
ACCOUNT AND THE EXTRA MONEY AS A

00:53:57.434 --> 00:54:00.637
RESULT OF INCREASED PURCHASES

00:54:00.704 --> 00:54:02.238
DURING- THE COURSE OF THE

00:54:02.305 --> 00:54:04.874
PANDEMIC DO WE HAVE ANY OR IS

00:54:04.941 --> 00:54:07.711
THERE ANY- THOUGHT THAT- THE

00:54:07.777 --> 00:54:10.080
INCREASED AMOUNT OF PURCHASING

00:54:10.146 --> 00:54:11.514
IS GOING TO CONTINUE ON IN THE

00:54:11.581 --> 00:54:13.249
FUTURE. AND CHAPLAIN IS FOR THAT

00:54:13.316 --> 00:54:15.218
QUESTION I ATE AT APPRECIATE

00:54:15.285 --> 00:54:18.021
THAT AND HIGHLIGHTING THAT YES

00:54:18.088 --> 00:54:19.923
SO AT THE BEGINNING OF THE

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:22.859
PANDEMIC- UNLIKE OTHER TYPES OF

00:54:22.926 --> 00:54:26.963
ECONOMIC- DISTURBANCES THAT HAVE

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:28.264
HAPPENED IN THIS FUND SOUGHT AN

00:54:28.331 --> 00:54:29.966
INCREDIBLE INCREASE THE NUMBER

00:54:30.033 --> 00:54:31.001
OF CONTAINERS THAT WERE BEING

00:54:31.067 --> 00:54:34.904
PURCHASED THAT RESULTED IN AB AT

00:54:34.971 --> 00:54:38.108
MUCH HIGHER- NUMBER OF THAT

00:54:38.174 --> 00:54:39.209
BEVERAGE CONTAINERS PURCHASED

00:54:39.275 --> 00:54:41.044
AND THEN AMOUNT ENOUGH OVERALL

00:54:41.111 --> 00:54:43.880
FIND- WE HAVE SEEN THAT CONTINUE

00:54:43.947 --> 00:54:46.449
TO DATE BUT OUR EXPECTATION IS

00:54:46.516 --> 00:54:49.552
AS- WE GET TO OUR NEW NEW NORMAL

00:54:49.619 --> 00:54:51.655
AS YOU SAY IT THAT WE WOULD SEE

00:54:51.721 --> 00:54:53.957
A LEVELING UP. OFF AND A

00:54:54.024 --> 00:54:54.991
DECREASE IN THAT OVERALL

00:54:55.058 --> 00:54:56.593
PURCHASE SO IF WE JUST THINK

00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:58.194
ANECDOTALLY OF WHAT'S HAPPENING

00:54:58.261 --> 00:55:00.030
IN OUR IN HOUSEHOLDS YES WE

00:55:00.096 --> 00:55:02.265
PROBABLY WERE BUYING- CASES OF

00:55:02.332 --> 00:55:03.933
BEVERAGE CONTAINERS BOTTLED

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.202
WATER CANNED- SO DOES ITS

00:55:06.269 --> 00:55:08.204
ADDRESS AT DURING THE PANDEMIC

00:55:08.271 --> 00:55:10.840
THAT NUMBER NO SODA I DON'T BY

00:55:10.907 --> 00:55:12.809
STATE LOOK AT THAT THE-

00:55:12.876 --> 00:55:17.547
SPARKLING. WATER IN. THE THING

00:55:17.614 --> 00:55:19.082
IN OUR HOUSEHOLD THAT IS OUR OR

00:55:19.149 --> 00:55:22.218
HEALTH. A LOT OF SPARKLY MY IN

00:55:22.285 --> 00:55:24.521
OUR BUT AS THEY- AS WE AG BACK

00:55:24.587 --> 00:55:26.423
AND THE WORKPLACE IT BACK IN A

00:55:26.489 --> 00:55:27.490
RESTAURANT WE ANTICIPATE THAT

00:55:27.557 --> 00:55:28.858
THOSE NUMBERS OF WELL DECREASE

00:55:28.925 --> 00:55:29.859
AGAIN BACK TO MORE HISTORIC

00:55:29.926 --> 00:55:31.461
NUMBERS AND THAT'S WHY THIS

00:55:31.528 --> 00:55:33.663
PROPOSAL TREATS THIS AS AT ONE

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:36.566
TIME- FUNDING INCREASE AS

00:55:36.633 --> 00:55:39.569
OPPOSED TO A NEW TRENDS WITHIN.

00:55:39.636 --> 00:55:43.339
THE FUND. THANKS IT WAS SO HAVE

00:55:43.406 --> 00:55:44.808
WE SEEN THE CURVE KINDA LEVEL

00:55:44.874 --> 00:55:46.710
OFF YET OR IS IT STILL- WELL IT

00:55:46.776 --> 00:55:48.645
IS. IT IS LEVELING AT THAT

00:55:48.712 --> 00:55:51.181
HIGHER LEVEL RIGHT NOW- BUT

00:55:51.247 --> 00:55:54.250
AGAIN THE WORLD IS- IS CHANGING

00:55:54.317 --> 00:55:57.020
EVERY DAY- AND SO AGAIN HAPPY TO

00:55:57.087 --> 00:55:58.521
COME BACK AND TALK TO THE

00:55:58.588 --> 00:55:59.556
LEGISLATURE AGAIN IN THE

00:55:59.622 --> 00:56:01.391
BEGINNING OF NEXT YEAR AFTER.

00:56:01.458 --> 00:56:02.792
THAT PERHAPS THE WORLD HAS

00:56:02.859 --> 00:56:04.060
CHANGED AGAIN TO HAVE A

00:56:04.127 --> 00:56:05.395
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THESE

00:56:05.462 --> 00:56:06.463
TRENDS ARE BUT THE HISTORIC

00:56:06.529 --> 00:56:08.565
TRENDS THAT WE HAVE USED FOR

00:56:08.631 --> 00:56:09.766
FORECASTING. FOR MANY MANY YEARS

00:56:09.833 --> 00:56:12.202
ARE NOT PLAYING OUT CURRENTLY SO

00:56:12.268 --> 00:56:13.837
ONE CONCERN THAT I'VE HEARD

00:56:13.903 --> 00:56:16.406
ABOUT THE- A PROPOSAL THAT YOU.

00:56:16.473 --> 00:56:19.008
I THINK IT'S VERY- GUY MADE OF-

00:56:19.075 --> 00:56:23.546
BUT ONE CONSERVER IS THAT- THAT

00:56:23.613 --> 00:56:25.782
PEOPLE- OF ANTICIPATE THAT THE

00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:28.084
RATE IS GOING TO GO. UP IN THE

00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:29.886
FUTURE AND SO THE HOLD ON TO

00:56:29.953 --> 00:56:31.755
THEIR RECYCLABLES AND HOARD THEM

00:56:31.821 --> 00:56:36.526
ESSENTIALLY AND- WAIT FOR THE-

00:56:36.593 --> 00:56:37.594
FOR THE REDEMPTION VALUE TO GO

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:40.330
UP- IS THERE A WAY TO PROTECT

00:56:40.396 --> 00:56:45.001
AGAINST THAT. DO DID NOT SEE

00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:47.237
THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN IN

00:56:47.303 --> 00:56:49.205
THE PAST WHEN REDEMPTION RATES

00:56:49.272 --> 00:56:52.542
WENT UP AND HAD A- EXCUSE ME AT

00:56:52.609 --> 00:56:53.710
REDEMPTION RATES BUT REDEMPTION

00:56:53.777 --> 00:56:55.645
VALUE WENT UP- ABOUT A DECADE

00:56:55.712 --> 00:56:58.181
AGO. WE DID NOT SEE THE TRENDS

00:56:58.248 --> 00:57:00.383
REALLY- WHERE PEOPLE HALTED

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:01.918
THEIR RECYCLING AND THEN BROUGHT

00:57:01.985 --> 00:57:04.587
THEM IN AT A LATER DATE. ALSO IN

00:57:04.654 --> 00:57:06.222
OTHER STATES AS THEY BUMPED UP

00:57:06.289 --> 00:57:08.158
THE REDEMPTION VALUE YOU DID NOT

00:57:08.224 --> 00:57:09.692
SEE THAT KIND OF TREND WE HAVE

00:57:09.759 --> 00:57:11.194
HEARD THIS CONCERN BROUGHT UP

00:57:11.261 --> 00:57:13.863
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS-

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:15.198
THAT IT WAS ANECDOTALLY. ALREADY

00:57:15.265 --> 00:57:16.666
HAPPENING I'M NOT REALLY SURE

00:57:16.733 --> 00:57:18.334
HOW THAT DATA WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:20.270
COLLECTED BECAUSE NOTHING SINCE

00:57:20.336 --> 00:57:21.271
APRIL FIRST WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:57:21.337 --> 00:57:23.873
REPORTED. I INTO THAT PROGRAM

00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:25.942
THAT WOULD GIVE US ANY

00:57:26.009 --> 00:57:26.643
INDICATION THAT THAT WAS THE

00:57:26.709 --> 00:57:29.479
CASE- SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT

00:57:29.546 --> 00:57:30.613
WE'RE HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT IF

00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:32.182
THAT BECOMES AN IT BECOMES AN

00:57:32.248 --> 00:57:35.552
ISSUE BUT THAT HAS NOT BEEN AN

00:57:35.618 --> 00:57:36.486
ISSUE. THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE

00:57:36.553 --> 00:57:38.822
PAST. WE DO YOU THINK I THINK IT

00:57:38.888 --> 00:57:40.356
JUST IT ON THAT NOTE THAT- ROSS

00:57:40.423 --> 00:57:43.860
PRODUCT. AND WAS THE PURPOSE OF

00:57:43.927 --> 00:57:45.628
THIS OF GETTING THOSE OF BOTTLES

00:57:45.695 --> 00:57:48.264
AND CANS THAT ARE. PERHAPS BEING

00:57:48.331 --> 00:57:51.301
HELD IN PEOPLE'S GARAGES AND-

00:57:51.367 --> 00:57:54.137
AND TODAY. IS THAT WE'RE NOT

00:57:54.204 --> 00:57:56.005
SEEING THE BOTTLES AND CANS I'M

00:57:56.072 --> 00:57:58.608
SHOWING UP IN LANDFILLS ARE ARE-

00:57:58.675 --> 00:58:00.109
WASTE CHARACTERIZATIONS ARE NOT

00:58:00.176 --> 00:58:01.845
SHOWING A HUGE INFLUX OF THESE

00:58:01.911 --> 00:58:02.846
BEVERAGE CONTAINERS IS

00:58:02.912 --> 00:58:04.080
RECYCLABLE CONTAINERS IN OUR

00:58:04.147 --> 00:58:06.149

WHATEVER IS OUT THERE BACK INTO

00:58:12.555 --> 00:58:14.691
THE RECYCLING SYSTEM AND THEN

00:58:14.757 --> 00:58:16.125
GET IT RE MANUFACTURED INTO NEW

00:58:16.192 --> 00:58:19.762
BEVERAGE CONTAINER. HOW DO THE

00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:22.866
INVEST SAID YOUR PER- TRANSLATE

00:58:22.932 --> 00:58:26.336
INTO- A PERMANENT CHANGES AND-

00:58:26.402 --> 00:58:28.271
RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT

00:58:28.338 --> 00:58:30.039
WAS A REALLY EXCELLENT QUESTION

00:58:30.106 --> 00:58:32.442

WHEN WE WORK WITH THE

00:58:39.749 --> 00:58:40.516
LEGISLATURE TO COME UP WITH SOME

00:58:40.583 --> 00:58:43.920
OF THE LONGER TERM. SOLUTIONS SO

OTHER WORK FORCE- DEVELOPMENT

00:58:52.228 --> 00:58:54.330
PROGRAMS TO DO MOBILE RECYCLING.

THAT WOULD BE A THREE TO FIVE

00:58:56.299 --> 00:58:58.468
YEAR PROGRAM OBVIOUSLY NOT A

00:58:58.534 --> 00:59:00.703
LONG TERM PROGRAM BUT REALLY

OUT TO EVERY CALIFORNIA AND-

00:59:31.034 --> 00:59:32.535
SEND SOME OF OUR SOLUTIONS ARE

00:59:32.602 --> 00:59:35.138
TRULY MEANT. TO FACILITATE

00:59:35.204 --> 00:59:37.774
LONGER TERM SOLUTIONS IN THIS

00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:40.009
PROGRAM AND REALLY OPEN UP THIS

00:59:40.076 --> 00:59:42.211
PROGRAM TO SOME NEW CREATIVE

00:59:42.278 --> 00:59:44.347
VERY CALIFORNIA TYPE- KNOWLEDGE

00:59:44.414 --> 00:59:45.949
B. LIKE THE REVERSE VENDING

00:59:46.015 --> 00:59:48.551
MACHINES THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO

00:59:48.618 --> 00:59:51.020
SEE DEPLOYED. TO RETAILERS AND-

00:59:51.087 --> 00:59:53.089
OTHER AT STATE OR LOCAL

00:59:53.156 --> 00:59:55.291
FACILITIES AND THAT WE WOULD

00:59:55.358 --> 00:59:56.392
LOVE TO WORK WITH THE

00:59:56.459 --> 00:59:57.560
LEGISLATURE ON HOW TO BUILD THAT

00:59:57.627 --> 00:59:59.562
BUT A REVERSE VENDING MACHINE AS

00:59:59.629 --> 01:00:01.731
WE ALL KNOW TAKES UP A LOT LESS

01:00:01.798 --> 01:00:03.232
ROOM- THEN EACH TRUCK OR A

01:00:03.299 --> 01:00:05.201
TRAILER. AND WE THINK THAT WE

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:07.070
COULD DEPLOY A QUITE A FEW OF

01:00:07.136 --> 01:00:08.338
THOSE ACROSS THE STATE AND THEN

01:00:08.404 --> 01:00:09.539
REALLY FACILITATE THE

01:00:09.605 --> 01:00:11.441
DEVELOPMENT OF THAT TECHNOLOGY-

01:00:11.507 --> 01:00:14.777
AND- THE WIDESPREAD ACCEPTANCE

01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:18.715
OF THAT TECHNOLOGY. AND A VERY.

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:20.483
TYPE OF PLACE ACROSS STATE AND

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:23.987
UNDER THE- THE UPPER CAL RECYCLE

01:00:24.053 --> 01:00:26.489
PROPOSAL FOR REVERSE VENDING

01:00:26.556 --> 01:00:29.859
MACHINES. UM THE DEPARTMENT

01:00:29.926 --> 01:00:32.595
WOULD ESSENTIALLY SUBSIDIZE THE-

01:00:32.662 --> 01:00:35.264
OF PLACEMENT OF A MACHINE- AND

01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:36.799
THEN WHO WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE

01:00:36.866 --> 01:00:38.935
FOR- MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION

01:00:39.002 --> 01:00:41.871
COSTS IS SO I THINK IT REALLY

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:43.473
DEPENDS ON AND THE TYPE OF

01:00:43.539 --> 01:00:45.475
CONTRACT THAT THE FACILITY WOULD

01:00:45.541 --> 01:00:47.944
ENTER INTO SO LET'S TAKE FOR

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:51.180
INSTANCE- A RETAIL FACILITY

01:00:51.247 --> 01:00:52.815
WHERE WE WOULD DEPLOY WE WERE

01:00:52.882 --> 01:00:55.018
PERHAPS SUBSIDIZE THE UP FRONT

01:00:55.084 --> 01:00:57.053
COST OF PURCHASING OR LEASING

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.389
THE- REVERSE VENDING MACHINE IT

01:00:59.455 --> 01:01:01.624
WOULD THEN BE PLACED- IN THE

01:01:01.691 --> 01:01:03.426
FACILITY OR AT THE GROCERY STORE

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:05.762
AND THEN THAT- FACILITY WOULD

01:01:05.828 --> 01:01:07.663
CONTRACT WITH A COMPANY THAT

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:08.498
PROVIDED THE RIVER SPENDING

01:01:08.564 --> 01:01:10.633
USING SO NOT UNLIKE. A VENDING

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:14.871
MACHINE FOR- NOT GONNA USE CANDY

01:01:14.937 --> 01:01:16.005
INSTEAD OF IT. OTHER SNACKS THAT

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:20.376
YOU WOULD GET- IT WOULD BE A

01:01:20.443 --> 01:01:21.677
SIMILAR TYPE OF CONTRACTING

01:01:21.744 --> 01:01:23.279
SITUATION SO THIS WOULD REALLY

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:24.847
BE MEANT TO FACILITATE THOSE UP

01:01:24.914 --> 01:01:26.249
FRONT COSTS AND THEN THE

01:01:26.315 --> 01:01:27.183
FACILITIES WOULD WORK OUT

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:29.118
THROUGH A CONTRACT. WITH THE

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:34.457
WITH THE PROVIDER- THERE'RE- ARE

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:35.892
A MYRIAD OF OTHER ISSUES WITH

01:01:35.958 --> 01:01:38.061
THE RECYCLING SYSTEM- FOR

01:01:38.127 --> 01:01:39.729
EXAMPLE THE CO MINGLING OF

01:01:39.796 --> 01:01:41.597
PLASTIC AND GLASS ON GLASS

01:01:41.664 --> 01:01:45.802
BREAKAGE AND- HI AND SO FORTH

01:01:45.868 --> 01:01:49.605
WHAT TO. WHAT WHAT WHAT KINDS OF

01:01:49.672 --> 01:01:51.641

OR HOW DO YOU PROPOSE TO MOVE

01:01:54.077 --> 01:01:55.411
FORWARD ON- THOSE- OTHER

01:01:55.478 --> 01:01:58.548
PROBLEMS STILL ON THAT SPECIFIC

01:01:58.614 --> 01:02:00.650
ISSUE WE ALSO GAVE A GREAT DEAL

01:02:00.716 --> 01:02:02.985
THOUGHT TO THAT AND YOU HAVE IN

01:02:03.052 --> 01:02:05.588
THE PROPOSAL THE TO. THE TO

01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:06.889
AMOUNTS THAT WE WOULD PROVIDE

FOR THE TO QUALITY INCENTIVE

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:09.926
PROGRAMS THAT ARE REALLY MEANT

01:02:09.992 --> 01:02:12.528
VERY SPECIFICALLY TO GET AT THAT

01:02:12.595 --> 01:02:15.565
ISSUE- IT MAKES NO SENSE FOR US

01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:17.433
TO GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO TRY TO

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:18.734
RETRIEVE ALL THESE BEVERAGE

01:02:18.801 --> 01:02:20.269
CONTAINERS IF IT IF ATTHE END

01:02:20.336 --> 01:02:22.672
OF THE DAY. THEY END UP IN BALES

01:02:22.738 --> 01:02:25.475
OR IN- A CONDITION THAT ISN'T

01:02:25.541 --> 01:02:27.376
RECYCLABLE AND SO MAKING THOSE

01:02:27.443 --> 01:02:30.980
INVESTMENTS IN- ARE. QUALITY

01:02:31.047 --> 01:02:34.550
INCENTIVE AND- PLASTIC MATERIALS

01:02:34.617 --> 01:02:38.121
PMDP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND AT

01:02:38.187 --> 01:02:39.755
HELPS WITH INSURING THAT THEY

THE MATERIALS THAT WE ARE

01:02:41.224 --> 01:02:42.658
GETTING BACK IS AT THE HIGHEST

01:02:42.725 --> 01:02:44.293
QUALITY AND RECYCLABLE AGAIN WE

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.561
WANT BEVERAGE CONTAINER TO

01:02:45.628 --> 01:02:47.230
BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING

01:02:47.296 --> 01:02:49.665
WE'VE GOT INVESTMENTS ACROSS-

01:02:49.732 --> 01:02:50.766
OUR VARIOUS INDUSTRIES WHETHER

pHERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:02:57.707 --> 01:02:59.775
TO TRULY CAPTURE AND RECYCLE

01:02:59.842 --> 01:03:01.377
THOSE MATERIALS AND WE NEED TO

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:02.845
MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE

01:03:02.912 --> 01:03:05.214

BUSINESSES TRULY- CIRCUIT. HAVE

01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:16.092
YOU CONSIDERED USING OF THE-

01:03:16.159 --> 01:03:18.561
FUNDS THAT- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:20.363
TODAY. TO INSTALL WATER

01:03:20.429 --> 01:03:23.866
REFILLING STATIONS AT SCHOOLS.

01:03:23.933 --> 01:03:25.034
SOMEBODY I KNOW HAS A BILL ON

01:03:25.101 --> 01:03:27.670
THE TOP- BUT THE BENEFIT OF THAT

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:34.477
WOULD BE- THE- LESS USAGE OF-

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:37.113
SINGLE USE PLASTICS PLASTICS I

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:38.481
THINK THAT WOULD IS M. AN

01:03:38.548 --> 01:03:41.384
INNOVATIVE IDEA AND I THINK THAT

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:42.718
WOULD BE SOMETHING WORTH

01:03:42.785 --> 01:03:44.620
DISCUSSING THE LESS WE NEED-

01:03:44.687 --> 01:03:47.190
SINGLE USE MATERIALS THE BETTER

01:03:47.256 --> 01:03:49.025
OFF WE ARE. THIS WAS VERY MUCH

01:03:49.091 --> 01:03:53.829
AT- STRUCTURED AROUND- THE

01:03:53.896 --> 01:03:55.531
BEVERAGE CONTAINERS THAT ARE IN

01:03:55.598 --> 01:03:58.701
THE SYSTEM BUT IF THAT IS

01:03:58.768 --> 01:03:59.535
SOMETHING THAT THE CHAIR WOULD

01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:01.037
LIKE TO DISCUSS I'D BE HAPPY TO.

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:03.172
AYE OKAY I LEFT MY PROP ON MY

01:04:03.239 --> 01:04:04.907
DESK AS I RUSHED OVER HERE-

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:07.643
MIKE- REUSABLE BOTTLE THAT SAYS-

01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:12.215
WATER- WATER- ZERO GRAMS SUGAR

01:04:12.281 --> 01:04:15.351
FOR THOSE OF A- YOU ARE

01:04:15.418 --> 01:04:18.187
INTERESTED IN THAT ISSUE- BUT I

01:04:18.254 --> 01:04:20.122
DO THINK THAT THAT MIGHT BE- AND

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:21.991
APPROPRIATE USE FOR- SOME OF

01:04:22.058 --> 01:04:25.561
THOSE FUNDS. AT LAST QUESTION I

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:31.067
HAVE- RELATES TO- THE LANGUAGE

01:04:31.133 --> 01:04:33.369
THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THAT

01:04:33.436 --> 01:04:35.671
EXEMPTS ALL CURRENT LAWS

01:04:35.738 --> 01:04:37.240
INCLUDING THE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:04:37.306 --> 01:04:39.208
PRACTICE ACT IN THE PUBLIC

01:04:39.275 --> 01:04:40.476
CONTRACT CODE REQUIREMENTS IS

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:42.979
THAT REALLY NECESSARY. WE WERE

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:44.680
REALLY FOCUSED ON VERY QUICKLY

01:04:44.747 --> 01:04:46.082
DEPLOYING THE SOLUTIONS AND TO

01:04:46.148 --> 01:04:47.617
GO THROUGH THE APA PROCESS OR

01:04:47.683 --> 01:04:49.318
SOME OF THESE OTHER PROCESS SEES

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:51.854
REALLY DOESN'T GET- THE

01:04:51.921 --> 01:04:53.589
SOLUTIONS DEPLOYED IN THE NEXT

01:04:53.656 --> 01:04:56.592
YEAR IT REALLYIN THE ÁP PROCESS

01:04:56.659 --> 01:04:58.728

FOUR MONTHS AND SINCE THIS WAS

01:05:03.032 --> 01:05:03.899
ONE TIME FUNDS- THAT WERE MEANT

01:05:03.966 --> 01:05:05.268
TO ADDRESS A PROBLEM THAT I

01:05:05.334 --> 01:05:06.736
THINK WE ALL AGREE IS THERE

01:05:06.802 --> 01:05:09.372
TODAY. WE FELT THAT WE HAD

01:05:09.438 --> 01:05:11.207
ENOUGH INFORMATION TO HAVE A

ENOUGH INFORMATION THAT WE

01:05:18.047 --> 01:05:19.715
DIDN'T NEED A NEW REGULATORY

01:05:19.782 --> 01:05:22.385
PROCESS TO IMPLEMENT BUT RATHER

01:05:22.451 --> 01:05:24.020
A NEST INFORMATION TO DEPLOY

SOME OF THE EXPERIENCES WE'VE

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:29.592
HAD AROUND MOBILE RECYCLING OR

01:05:29.659 --> 01:05:31.127
REVERSE VENDING MACHINES I THINK

01:05:31.193 --> 01:05:33.896
AND OUR OUR REAL GOAL HERE WAS

01:05:33.963 --> 01:05:35.431

DON'T MY WHOLE BAG IN THERE IS A

01:05:46.542 --> 01:05:48.844
BY INDIVIDUAL BUT WAIT VOLUME

01:05:48.911 --> 01:05:50.313
HOW IS IT CALCULATED AT SO IT

01:05:50.379 --> 01:05:51.947
DEPENDS ON THE MACHINE RIGHT NOW

01:05:52.014 --> 01:05:53.816
MOST OF THE MACHINES ARE ONE

01:05:53.883 --> 01:05:56.052
CANADA TIME AND SO THIS WOULD

01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:57.953
NOT BE TO FACILITATE SOMEBODY

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:00.456
BRINGING AND- YOU KNOW A

01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:04.860
TRUCKLOAD OF- OF- ADD BOTTLES

01:06:04.927 --> 01:06:08.597
AND CANS BUT RATHER IF YOU HAD A

01:06:08.664 --> 01:06:10.933
BACK AS- FIFTY OR SO BUT I HAVE

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:11.901
HAD A CONGRESS. OF THE RIVER

01:06:11.967 --> 01:06:13.135
SENDING ME. AT MANUFACTURERS

01:06:13.202 --> 01:06:15.738
WHERE THEY ARE DEVISING SYSTEMS

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:19.275
THAT CAN- CAN I TAKE IN MORE

01:06:19.342 --> 01:06:20.109
THAN ONE CONTAINER AND I

01:06:20.176 --> 01:06:23.045
RECOGNIZE A TWELVE SCANNER

01:06:23.112 --> 01:06:24.780
SIXTEEN OUNCE CAN VERSUS

01:06:24.847 --> 01:06:26.115
SMASHED. TO A YOU KNOW GOOD OR

01:06:26.182 --> 01:06:27.616
DOES IT HAVE TO BE NOT CRUSHED

01:06:27.683 --> 01:06:29.418
BEFORE GOD AND I BELIEVE THAT

01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:30.853
MOST OF THE MACHINES REQUIRE IT

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.355
TO NOT BE CRUSHED BUT THERE ARE

01:06:32.421 --> 01:06:33.322
AGAIN THE DIFFERENT

01:06:33.389 --> 01:06:34.724
MANUFACTURERS ARE DOING SOME

01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:35.991
REALLY INTERESTING THINGS IN

01:06:36.058 --> 01:06:37.560
TERMS OF THE DAY THE DIFFERENT

01:06:37.626 --> 01:06:39.995
TECHNOLOGY NOW- AND- THE

01:06:40.062 --> 01:06:45.101
COMPUTERS WITHIN THE. SYSTEM TO

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:46.769
BE ABLE TO I F. BUT I. A I

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:48.304
SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT A PROMISE

01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:50.106
BUT AT. KNOW THAT THE C. R. V.

01:06:50.172 --> 01:06:52.108
LAIT HAS TO BE A- FOR IT TO RE

01:06:52.174 --> 01:06:54.443
YEAH. YEAH EXACTLY. AND THEN.

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:57.613
HOW DO I PUT HIM IN THERE IS IT.

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.548
WITH THE REACH IF TO MARK OR-

01:06:59.615 --> 01:07:01.016
PARTICULAR LIQUOR STORE I GET A

01:07:01.083 --> 01:07:02.618
RECEIPT AND THEN I GOING TO GET

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:04.587
A REFUND FROM THE- VENDOR SO

01:07:04.653 --> 01:07:06.555
SOME OF US ARE RECEIPTS WHERE

01:07:06.622 --> 01:07:08.557
YOU CAN GET A REFUND RIGHT THERE

01:07:08.624 --> 01:07:10.159
FROM THE VENDOR AND SOME OF THEM

01:07:10.226 --> 01:07:13.129
WILL DEPOSIT DIRECTLY INTO A

01:07:13.195 --> 01:07:14.363
BANK ACCOUNT IF YOU WOULD LIKE.

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:15.131
OBSERVER OF SOME REALLY

01:07:15.197 --> 01:07:16.532
INTERESTING THINGS HAPPENING IN

01:07:16.599 --> 01:07:18.033
THIS AREA OF TECHNOLOGY THERE

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.069
ARE A COUPLE OF COMPANIES. THAT

01:07:20.136 --> 01:07:21.837
ARE REALLY EXCITED TO BE MORE

01:07:21.904 --> 01:07:22.872
PRESENT HERE IN CALIFORNIA

01:07:22.938 --> 01:07:24.206
BECAUSE IT ALLOWS THEM THAT

01:07:24.273 --> 01:07:25.775
OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER DEVELOP

01:07:25.841 --> 01:07:27.543
THIS TECHNOLOGY SO. WE'RE REALLY

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:29.211
HOPING THAT THIS IS SOMETHING

01:07:29.278 --> 01:07:30.579
THAT CAN. GROW HERE IN

01:07:30.646 --> 01:07:32.114
CALIFORNIA KIND OF A FOLLOW UP

01:07:32.181 --> 01:07:34.283
IN TWO SO I'VE PUT. I GOT A BAG

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:36.519
OF LET'S JUST SAY FIFTY KHZ. I

01:07:36.585 --> 01:07:39.355
GET TWENTY FIVE IN THERE IT IS

01:07:39.422 --> 01:07:41.023
FULL. I STILL GOTTA KEEP MY

01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:43.125
OTHER TWENTY HOW LONG DOES IT

01:07:43.192 --> 01:07:44.193
TAKE HIM FOR SOMEONE TO COME TO

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:45.227
EMPTY THAT VENDING MACHINE

01:07:45.294 --> 01:07:47.129
BEFORE I CAN COME BACK. I HAVE

01:07:47.196 --> 01:07:48.631
AS I UNDERSTAND IT AS THIS IS

01:07:48.697 --> 01:07:50.199
BEEN DEPLOYED AND STATES LIKE

01:07:50.266 --> 01:07:51.667
OREGON AND MICHIGAN THAT THEY

01:07:51.734 --> 01:07:55.271
ARE VERY QUICK TO- TO BE ABLE TO

01:07:55.337 --> 01:07:57.139
DEPLOY PEOPLE TO DO IT TO COME

01:07:57.206 --> 01:07:59.508
IN AND DO THE MACHINES AND THAT.

01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:00.443
THERE IS A LOT OF CONNECTION

01:08:00.509 --> 01:08:02.545
BETWEEN. THAT COMPANY WHO'S

01:08:02.611 --> 01:08:03.779
MAINTAINING THE MACHINE AND THE

01:08:03.846 --> 01:08:05.481
MACHINE ITSELF SO THEY KNOW WHEN

01:08:05.548 --> 01:08:07.383
IT'S WITHIN TWENTY FIVE CANS OF

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:09.218
IT SAY THEY THEY THEY DO HAVE

01:08:09.285 --> 01:08:11.220
THEMSELVES ON. AT LOGISTICS

01:08:11.287 --> 01:08:12.354
SCHEDULES IT SAID RIGHT TO

01:08:12.421 --> 01:08:13.956
MAINTAIN THE MACHINE SOMETIMES

01:08:14.023 --> 01:08:15.724
SOME KIND OF ELECTRONIC SIGNAL

01:08:15.791 --> 01:08:17.860
SENSOR NOBODY HAS COME AND

01:08:17.927 --> 01:08:19.962
VISUALLY LOOK AT IT YEAH ALL OF

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:20.596
THE MAJOR THESE REVERSE VENDING

01:08:20.663 --> 01:08:22.131
THE REPRESENTATIONS AND HAVE.

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:23.933
SOME PRETTY INTERESTING AT

01:08:23.999 --> 01:08:25.568
TECHNOLOGY BUT COMPLEX COMPUTERS

01:08:25.634 --> 01:08:27.036
IN THEM THAT ARE COMMUNICATING

01:08:27.102 --> 01:08:28.871
AND SAID THE MAINTENANCE- THE

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:30.005
OVERALL MAINTENANCE COSTS FOR

01:08:30.072 --> 01:08:31.607
THE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN.

01:08:31.674 --> 01:08:33.375
DECREASING OVER TIME AS THEY

01:08:33.442 --> 01:08:34.844
DEVELOP THEIR TECHNOLOGY MAYBE

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:36.445
JUST THE EDUCATIONAL PARTNERS

01:08:36.512 --> 01:08:41.517
MAKE. SURE THEY DON'T SMASHED

01:08:41.584 --> 01:08:43.819
THE CAN BECAUSE IT. RIGHT RIGHT

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:44.487
THAT IT YEAH THAT IS ONE OF THE

01:08:44.553 --> 01:08:46.255
CHALLENGE WITH- SOME OF THE

01:08:46.322 --> 01:08:47.656
TECHNOLOGY AND REVERSE VENDING

01:08:47.723 --> 01:08:49.058
MACHINE BACKDROPS ET CETERA THE

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.426
COMPUTERS HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:52.595
READ THE CRB WHEELER BE ABLE TO

01:08:52.661 --> 01:08:54.430
TRACK ALL RIGHT THIS MACHINE IS

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:55.865
IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA IT'S NOT

01:08:55.931 --> 01:08:59.268
GETTING ANY ACTIVITY AND ANOTHER

01:08:59.335 --> 01:09:01.170
ONE IS GETTING A LOT OF CAN WE

01:09:01.237 --> 01:09:03.172
PUT TWO OF THEM IN THAT AREA AND

01:09:03.239 --> 01:09:04.840
MOVE THEM AROUND THAT WAY TOO

01:09:04.907 --> 01:09:06.242
EIGHT EXACTLY THAT IS

01:09:06.308 --> 01:09:07.676
BENEFITS I THINK OF THIS

01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:08.711
PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY AGAIN

01:09:08.777 --> 01:09:12.982
BECAUSE- THEY- HAVE THESE-

01:09:13.048 --> 01:09:14.383
COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND THEN. THAT

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:16.919
THE ABILITY TO COLLECT SPECIFIC

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:18.754
DATA ABOUT. THE KINDS OF

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:20.122
MATERIALS THAT ARE COMING BACK

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:21.991
WHEN THEY'RE COMING BACK AT HOW

01:09:22.057 --> 01:09:23.459
MUCH A MACHINE IS BEING USED

01:09:23.526 --> 01:09:26.028
WILL BE- ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS OF

01:09:26.095 --> 01:09:27.730
THIS TECHNOLOGY. I AM AM I

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:33.035
CORRECT THAT- WHAT THE-

01:09:33.102 --> 01:09:35.037
REDEMPTION VALUE IS RETURNED TO

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:37.039
THE CONSUMER IN THE FORM OF A-

01:09:37.106 --> 01:09:42.311
CREDIT- FOR USE AT TO A- OKAY I

01:09:42.378 --> 01:09:43.812
DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER USED

01:09:43.879 --> 01:09:45.915
THE COINSTAR MACHINES- BUT I

01:09:45.981 --> 01:09:48.617
USED TO OUR- CLIENTS AND THAT

01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:51.587
WAS A GOOD PLACE TO RETURN- BUT

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:53.689
YOU WOULD GET THERE YOU GET A

01:09:53.756 --> 01:09:55.157
COUPON BACK FOR AND YOU CAN

01:09:55.224 --> 01:09:56.492
CHOOSE- EITHER I THINK FOR THE

01:09:56.559 --> 01:09:58.527
STORE- CREDIT AT THE STORE THAT

01:09:58.594 --> 01:10:01.830
YOU'RE- IN. OR THROUGH AMAZON

01:10:01.897 --> 01:10:05.100
OR- OTHER PLACES TOO AND OUR

01:10:05.167 --> 01:10:06.835
CURRENT STATUTE REQUIRES THAT

01:10:06.902 --> 01:10:08.771
YOU HAVE AVAILABILITY TO CASH

01:10:08.837 --> 01:10:12.741
RIGHT ON THE SPOT SO- ALL RIGHT

01:10:12.808 --> 01:10:14.577
SOME OF- IT I WOULD THINK AT A

01:10:14.643 --> 01:10:16.512
RETAILER IF IT WERE GOING TO

01:10:16.579 --> 01:10:18.714
MEET THAT STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS

01:10:18.781 --> 01:10:20.449
YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GET

01:10:20.516 --> 01:10:21.317
CASH ON THE SPOT BUT SAY YOU

01:10:21.383 --> 01:10:23.285
KNOW SOMEONE HAD SUGGESTED AND

01:10:23.352 --> 01:10:24.653
ONE OF OUR MEETINGS. WHEN THIS

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.956
BE INTERESTING TO DEPLOY A AT

01:10:27.022 --> 01:10:28.657
SAY A LIBRARY WALL LIBRARY

01:10:28.724 --> 01:10:30.960
OBVIOUSLY IS NOT GOING TO HAVE A

01:10:31.026 --> 01:10:32.995
CASH BOX SITTING THERE TO DEPLOY

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:35.197
BUT THAT FACILITY COULD PERHAPS

01:10:35.264 --> 01:10:37.933
HAVE SOMETHING THAT- WOULD BE A

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.735
CREDIT THAT YOU COULD USE OR

01:10:39.802 --> 01:10:42.338
AGAIN. AND IF YOU HAVE A PAYPAL

01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:44.173
OR VENMO ACCOUNT OR SOMETHING

01:10:44.239 --> 01:10:45.975
LIKE THAT THAT THAT MONEY CAN GO

01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:47.343
DIRECTLY FROM THE MACHINE INTO

01:10:47.409 --> 01:10:48.677
YOUR ACCOUNT SO THERE ARE SOME

01:10:48.744 --> 01:10:51.580
OF REALLY INNOVATIVE IDEAS- THAT

01:10:51.647 --> 01:10:54.516
AGAIN IF WE ARE. LOOKING FOR

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:56.852
OPPORTUNITY BUT NOT NECESSARILY

01:10:56.919 --> 01:10:58.621
TO MEET EVERY SINGLE REQUIREMENT

01:10:58.687 --> 01:10:59.955
UNDER THE STATUTE THIS IS A

01:11:00.022 --> 01:11:02.925
GREAT WAY TO DO THAT AND IT WILL

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:05.394
HELP DEVELOP THE TECHNOLOGY EVEN

01:11:05.461 --> 01:11:07.162
FURTHER. GREAT WELL THANK YOU

01:11:07.229 --> 01:11:09.131
VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION

01:11:09.198 --> 01:11:11.100
OF THERE'S NO MORE QUESTIONS

01:11:11.166 --> 01:11:14.269
WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO

01:11:14.336 --> 01:11:19.074
EXCELLENT. THANK YOU MISTER

I THINK OUR FRIENDLY-

01:11:34.823 --> 01:11:37.059
CONSTRUCTION WORKERS OUTSIDE OF

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:39.595
. DECIDED TO RETALIATE BY

01:11:39.662 --> 01:11:43.098
PICKING UP EVEN NOISIER TOOLS.

01:11:43.165 --> 01:11:45.634
OKAY MAYBE WE CAN SEND SOME OF

01:11:45.701 --> 01:11:46.769
THE FOLKS WHO WERE IN THE

01:11:46.835 --> 01:11:52.007
HALLWAY OUT TO. TALK TO THEM. MR

01:11:52.074 --> 01:11:55.511
A- KNOCKED OUR WELCOME. ISSUE

01:11:55.577 --> 01:11:57.946
NUMBER TWO IS IMPLEMENTATION OF

01:11:58.013 --> 01:11:59.048
THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER

01:11:59.114 --> 01:12:01.884
MANAGEMENT ACT THE SIGMA PROGRAM

01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:03.452
YEAH THANK YOU AND GOVERNMENT

01:12:03.519 --> 01:12:06.121
CHAIR AND MEMBERS- THE

01:12:06.188 --> 01:12:07.056
GROUNDWATER IS A CRUCIAL

01:12:07.122 --> 01:12:08.390
RESOURCE FOR THE STATE OF

01:12:08.457 --> 01:12:09.425
CALIFORNIA THE LEGISLATURE

01:12:09.491 --> 01:12:11.727
PASSED SIGMA IN TWENTY FOURTEEN

01:12:11.794 --> 01:12:13.362
AND LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE BEEN

01:12:13.429 --> 01:12:15.597
WORKING TO CREATE PLANS TO

01:12:15.664 --> 01:12:16.765
MANAGE GROUNDWATER

01:12:16.832 --> 01:12:19.535
SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABLY- MANY

01:12:19.601 --> 01:12:20.836
GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY

01:12:20.903 --> 01:12:22.571
AGENCIES SUBMITTED THEIR PLANS

01:12:22.638 --> 01:12:25.274
IN TWENTY TWENTY TO THE

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:26.341
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES

01:12:26.408 --> 01:12:28.277
FOR THEIR EVALUATION- THE

01:12:28.343 --> 01:12:30.112
DEPARTMENT HAS FOUND TWELVE OF

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:32.081
THOSE BASINS TO HAVE INCOMPLETE

01:12:32.147 --> 01:12:33.849
PLANS FOR A RANGE OF DIFFERENT

01:12:33.916 --> 01:12:36.552
ISSUES. WHICH MEANS THE BOARD

01:12:36.618 --> 01:12:38.554
MAY BE CALLED UPON FOR ITS

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:40.889
PRIMARY ROLE IN SIGMA WHICH IS

01:12:40.956 --> 01:12:43.025
TO INTERVENE IN BASINS WHERE

01:12:43.092 --> 01:12:45.127
PLANS HAVE BEEN FOUND DEFICIENT

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:46.695
TO PROTECT DRINKING WATER AND

01:12:46.762 --> 01:12:49.231
OTHER WATER USES SO THIS SPRING

01:12:49.298 --> 01:12:51.467
FINANCE LETTER IS A REQUEST TO

01:12:51.533 --> 01:12:55.304
EXPAND OUR SEGMENTS HEME- SO

01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:56.505
THAT WE CAN CARRY OUT THOSE

01:12:56.572 --> 01:13:00.943
IMPORTANT ROLES. GREAT TO HAVE-

01:13:01.009 --> 01:13:03.879
REPORT. GOOD MORNING AVERAGE

01:13:03.946 --> 01:13:05.047
EILERS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:06.348
ANALYST'S OFFICE NICE TO SEE YOU

01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:08.584
IN PERSON- WE DON'T RAISE ANY

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:10.252
CONCERNS WITH THIS PARTICULAR

01:13:10.319 --> 01:13:12.488
PROPOSAL HOWEVER WE JUST WANNA

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:14.022
FLAG FOR YOU THAT THIS ONE POINT

01:13:14.089 --> 01:13:15.390
SEVEN MILLION- THAT'S BEING

01:13:15.457 --> 01:13:17.326
REQUESTED IS ONGOING GENERAL

01:13:17.392 --> 01:13:19.461
FUND AND THE SIGMA LEGISLATION

01:13:19.528 --> 01:13:21.063
ORIGINALLY CONTEMPLATED THAT

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:22.831
THIS OVERSIGHT REGULATORY ROLE

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:24.500
BY THE WATER BOARD WOULD BE

01:13:24.566 --> 01:13:26.668
FUNDED BY FEES OF AFFECTED-

01:13:26.735 --> 01:13:30.272
GROUNDWATER BASINS. SO IT IS IT

01:13:30.339 --> 01:13:31.740
YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF PREMATURE

01:13:31.807 --> 01:13:33.475
AT THIS POINT AS THINGS ARE JUST

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:35.144
GETTING UP AND RUNNING TO

01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:36.311
IDENTIFY WHO WOULD PAY AND WHAT

01:13:36.378 --> 01:13:38.514
THE RATES WOULD BE AND BE ABLE

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:39.615
TO COLLECT THE MONEY TO FUND THE

01:13:39.681 --> 01:13:40.783
STAFF THAT ARE NEEDED

01:13:40.849 --> 01:13:42.484
IMMEDIATELY BUT IT IS SOMETHING

01:13:42.551 --> 01:13:43.585
WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE

01:13:43.652 --> 01:13:45.053
PROBABLY WILL WANT TO REVISIT IN

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.255
A FEW YEARS AS- AS THOSE

01:13:46.321 --> 01:13:47.523
STRUCTURES AND FEES CHARGING M.

01:13:47.589 --> 01:13:49.258
SYSTEMS CAN BE PUT IN PLACE-

01:13:49.324 --> 01:13:52.261
BECAUSE AGAIN THE ORIGINAL

01:13:52.327 --> 01:13:53.362
INTENTION IS THAT THIS WOULD BE

01:13:53.428 --> 01:13:55.197
A- KIND OF BENEFICIARY PAYS TYPE

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:56.398
APPROACH RATHER THAN A GENERAL

01:13:56.465 --> 01:14:00.702
FUND SUPPORTED ACTIVITY. THANK

01:14:00.769 --> 01:14:02.604
YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT

01:14:02.671 --> 01:14:05.541
CRYSTAL SURE. POSTER HERE

01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:08.110
CRYSTALS ARE THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:10.479
LAND RAFIA- I JUST WANTED TO

01:14:10.546 --> 01:14:12.147
SORT OF FOLLOW UP ON THE

01:14:12.214 --> 01:14:13.182
COMMENTS FROM THE ALLEY- TO JUST

01:14:13.248 --> 01:14:14.750
FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE- THAT THE

01:14:14.817 --> 01:14:16.351
ADMINISTRATION AGREES THAT

01:14:16.418 --> 01:14:17.586
ULTIMATELY THE INTENT OF SIGMA

01:14:17.653 --> 01:14:19.755
WAS- THAT THAT FEES WOULD PAY

01:14:19.822 --> 01:14:21.390
FOR THE WORK ABOUT THE WATER

01:14:21.456 --> 01:14:22.357
BOARD THAT'S INCLUDED IN THIS

01:14:22.424 --> 01:14:24.860
PROPOSAL- BUT ALSO ECHO THE

01:14:24.927 --> 01:14:28.263
UNCERTAINTY

01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:30.232
OF HOW THE FEES WOULD BE SET.

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:31.800
AND ALSO THERE'S GOING TO BE A

01:14:31.867 --> 01:14:33.435
LAG- IN WHEN THOSE FEES ARE

01:14:33.502 --> 01:14:35.103
COLLECTED SO AT THIS POINT WE

01:14:35.170 --> 01:14:37.239
THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO PROVIDE

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:37.873
SOME ONGOING GENERAL FUND JUST

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:39.842
GIVEN THE CRITICAL NATURE OF- OF

01:14:39.908 --> 01:14:40.542
THIS WORK AND WE FULLY INTEND ON

01:14:40.609 --> 01:14:42.144
REVISITING THIS IN THE FUTURE

01:14:42.211 --> 01:14:43.645
ULTIMATELY I'M SHIFTING- THESE

01:14:43.712 --> 01:14:46.048
RESOURCES. AS APPROPRIATELY TO

01:14:46.114 --> 01:14:50.919

BEEN INFORMED. THAT UNTIL NOON.

01:14:53.288 --> 01:14:58.560
THAT IS GOING TO STOP. THAT MAY

01:14:58.627 --> 01:14:59.862
BE THE MOST IMPORTANT ACTION

01:14:59.928 --> 01:15:05.100
pTHAT I'VE BEEN HERE. AND I CAN

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:09.471
TELL YOU ALL APPRECIATE IT- WHAT

THANK YOU FOR THAT REPORT- I'M

01:15:11.807 --> 01:15:16.178
IS NOT POWER- Y. A. DOES THIS

01:15:16.245 --> 01:15:20.382
ACTION NOT QUALIFY FOR A- A

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:26.054
SEQUEL A CATEGORICAL EXEMPTION.

01:15:26.121 --> 01:15:28.257
SO UNDER UNDERSTOOD MASS WRITTEN

01:15:28.323 --> 01:15:30.525
A SEQUEL- IS REQUIRED FOR A

01:15:30.592 --> 01:15:31.860
STATE WATER BOARD INTERIM

01:15:31.927 --> 01:15:34.429
PLANNED ACTIVITIES- IT WAS JUST

01:15:34.496 --> 01:15:36.899
HOW HOW STIGMA WAS WAS DRAFTED-

01:15:36.965 --> 01:15:39.001
EVEN THOUGH OUR ROLE IN SEGMENT

01:15:39.067 --> 01:15:41.203
IS INTENDED TO BE ON A TEMPORARY

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:46.575
BASIS- M. AND- TO. GET OUT OF

01:15:46.642 --> 01:15:47.943
THE WAY AGAIN AS SOON AS

01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:49.411
POSSIBLE FOR LOCAL- FOR-

01:15:49.478 --> 01:15:52.180
UNENCUMBERED LOCAL MANAGEMENT-

01:15:52.247 --> 01:15:53.348
YEAH IT WAS IT WAS DRAFTED TO

01:15:53.415 --> 01:15:55.083
INCLUDE SEQUOIA SO THE SEQUEL

01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:56.418
REQUIREMENTS ARE ACTUALLY

01:15:56.485 --> 01:15:59.488
DRAFTED INTO. THE SEGMENT PLAN

01:15:59.554 --> 01:16:02.291
OR SIGMA DOES NOT EXEMPT THE

01:16:02.357 --> 01:16:03.558
STATE WATER BOARDS INTERIM

01:16:03.625 --> 01:16:10.198
PLANNING PROCESS FROM SEQUEL-

01:16:10.265 --> 01:16:11.300
THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL

01:16:11.366 --> 01:16:14.002
LANGUAGE WOULD DO SO- THAT THE

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:15.971
GOAL THERE WOULD BE TO ENSURE

01:16:16.038 --> 01:16:18.607
THE STATE WATER BOARD CAN ACT IN

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:19.675
THESE BASINS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:21.977
FOUND DEFICIENT IN A IN A TIMELY

01:16:22.044 --> 01:16:24.646
MANNER BUT- SO BUT MY QUESTION

01:16:24.713 --> 01:16:29.751
IS WHETHER OR- A- CATEGORICAL

01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:30.819
EXEMPTION WOULD EXIST IN ANY

01:16:30.886 --> 01:16:34.089
EVENT- I'M NOT SURE. I DON'T

01:16:34.156 --> 01:16:39.594
THINK SO. I'M. ONE OPTION- THAT

01:16:39.661 --> 01:16:41.697
WE COULD HAVE IF I COULD- THAT

01:16:41.763 --> 01:16:43.265
UTILIZE SIMPLY WANTED TO WOULD

01:16:43.332 --> 01:16:45.534
BE TO JUST PROVIDE THE FUNDING

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:48.603
FOR A- A SEQUEL AND ALICE'S IS

01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:50.806
THERE A REASON- WHAT WHAT WHAT

01:16:50.872 --> 01:16:52.741
WOULD HE REASON BE FOR NOT

01:16:52.808 --> 01:16:54.343
DOING THAT- THAT WOULD BE AN

01:16:54.409 --> 01:16:55.310
OPTION THAT IS THAT IS AN

01:16:55.377 --> 01:16:56.812
APPROACH THE LEGISLATURE COULD

01:16:56.878 --> 01:17:00.482
TAKE IT IT WOULD STILL DELAY-

01:17:00.549 --> 01:17:01.783
THE PROCESS OF STATE

01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:03.452
INTERVENTION WHERE IT WHERE IT

01:17:03.518 --> 01:17:06.121
IS NEEDED- BY BY A COUPLE OF

01:17:06.188 --> 01:17:09.591
YEARS POTENTIALLY AND THEN- CAN

01:17:09.658 --> 01:17:11.493
YOU. TELL US WHAT THE-

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.261
CONSEQUENCES OF- WAITING A

01:17:13.328 --> 01:17:14.896
COUPLE YEARS WOULD BE YEAH THE

01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:17.432
SIGNAL WAS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS A

01:17:17.499 --> 01:17:19.368
WHOLE RANGE OF UNDESIRABLE

01:17:19.434 --> 01:17:21.903
RESULTS INCLUDING. A DEPLETION

01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:23.638
OF GROUNDWATER LEVELS THAT CAUSE

01:17:23.705 --> 01:17:25.173
PEOPLE ON SHALLOW GROUNDWATER

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:27.409
WELLS TO RUN OUT OF WATER- OTHER

01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:29.544
UNDESIRABLE RESULTS INCLUDE A

01:17:29.611 --> 01:17:31.279
SUBSIDENCE OF THE LAND SURFACE

01:17:31.346 --> 01:17:32.948
THAT CAN BREAK OR DISRUPT

01:17:33.015 --> 01:17:37.119
INFRASTRUCTURE- AND SO DELAYS IN

01:17:37.185 --> 01:17:38.653
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:40.489
WATER BOARDS ROLE- THROUGH

01:17:40.555 --> 01:17:42.290
THROUGH STATE INTERVENTION-

01:17:42.357 --> 01:17:44.426
WOULD ALLOW A LOT OF. GROUND

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:45.761
WATER CONDITIONS EITHER WORSEN

01:17:45.827 --> 01:17:50.599
OR OR CONTINUE- IN A IN A

01:17:50.665 --> 01:17:52.367
PROBLEMATIC WAY. THANK YOU CAN

01:17:52.434 --> 01:17:54.503
I. ADD SOMETHING- SO I JUST

01:17:54.569 --> 01:17:55.971
WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT-

01:17:56.038 --> 01:17:58.340
CURRENTLY- UNDER UNDER STIGMA

01:17:58.407 --> 01:17:59.408
WHEN A GROUNDWATER

01:17:59.474 --> 01:18:01.343
SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY- IS

01:18:01.410 --> 01:18:03.111
RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING SORT

01:18:03.178 --> 01:18:05.847
OF THE PLAN THEY HAVE A SEQUEL

01:18:05.914 --> 01:18:06.815
EXEMPTION SO THE TRAILER BILL

01:18:06.882 --> 01:18:07.883
LANGUAGE BEFORE YOU IS

01:18:07.949 --> 01:18:09.418
ESSENTIALLY PROVIDING. AN

01:18:09.484 --> 01:18:11.353
EQUIVALENT- ACTUALLY MAYBE A

01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:12.687
LITTLE BIT LESSER SEQUEL

01:18:12.754 --> 01:18:14.689
EXEMPTION FOR THE STATE BOARD IN

01:18:14.756 --> 01:18:16.024
THOSE EVENTS WHERE THEY HAVE TO

01:18:16.091 --> 01:18:17.192
TAKE OVER THE RESPONSIBILITY OF

01:18:17.259 --> 01:18:18.960
DEVELOPING THE INTERIM PLAN SO

01:18:19.027 --> 01:18:20.729
IT'S JUST A KIND OF PROVIDE SOME

01:18:20.796 --> 01:18:22.864
CONSISTENCY- WITH THE

01:18:22.931 --> 01:18:24.266
GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY

01:18:24.332 --> 01:18:25.434
AGENCIES WHEN THEY'RE DEVELOPING

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.169
THESE PLANS. SO CERTAINLY WE

01:18:27.235 --> 01:18:29.404
COULD PROVIDE SOME FUNDING FOR A

01:18:29.471 --> 01:18:30.806
SEQUEL COMPLIANCE BUT WE JUST

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:32.474
KNOW THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE A

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:33.708
POTENTIALLY SEVERAL MILLIONS OF

01:18:33.775 --> 01:18:36.945
DOLLARS- YOU KNOW FOR EACH BASIN

01:18:37.012 --> 01:18:38.480
A LITTLE TAMALE FALLS UNDER THE

01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:41.349
WATER BOARD SO WE THINK THAT

01:18:41.416 --> 01:18:42.250
THIS IS- THE CORRECT WAY TO SORT

01:18:42.317 --> 01:18:44.553
OF REDUCE COSTS. ON THE STATE

01:18:44.619 --> 01:18:46.154
IT'S CONSISTENT WITH- IF THE

01:18:46.221 --> 01:18:47.889
LOCALS WERE- TAKING ON THESE

01:18:47.956 --> 01:18:50.492
ACTIONS AND THEN ALSO IT IT-

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:53.195
EXPEDITE SOME OF THE WORK HERE-

01:18:53.261 --> 01:18:58.200
AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED. GREAT

01:18:58.266 --> 01:19:00.702
THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:19:00.769 --> 01:19:01.770
MISTER SMITH QUESTIONS. EXCUSE

01:19:01.837 --> 01:19:06.508
ME IF WE CAN HAVE AN EXEMPTION

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:11.012
FOR THE SEQUEL FOR THE- SIGMA.

01:19:11.079 --> 01:19:12.581
CAN WE EXEMPT UP FOR WATER

01:19:12.647 --> 01:19:14.683
STORAGE PROJECTS FROM PROP ONE

01:19:14.749 --> 01:19:16.751
THAT WE GET INTO FOR TWO

01:19:16.818 --> 01:19:18.186
THOUSAND FOURTEEN TO START GET

01:19:18.253 --> 01:19:19.354
SOME OF THESE WATER PROJECTS

01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:20.455
MOVING A LOT QUICKER BECAUSE OF

01:19:20.522 --> 01:19:23.458
THE SITE SO I THINK IT I WANT TO

01:19:23.525 --> 01:19:24.626
SEE OUR SAY FORTY EIGHT OF FIFTY

01:19:24.693 --> 01:19:26.495
YEARS WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR CAN

01:19:26.561 --> 01:19:27.596
WE WAIVE THE EXEMPTION OR CAN

01:19:27.662 --> 01:19:29.397
THE GOVERNOR TO AN EXECUTIVE

01:19:29.464 --> 01:19:31.566
ORDER IN START WATER PROJECTS.

01:19:31.633 --> 01:19:35.137
STORAGE RIGHT NOW. SO I DON'T

01:19:35.203 --> 01:19:36.838
HAVE A AN ANSWER FOR YOU

01:19:36.905 --> 01:19:37.939
IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUSLY THOUGH THE

01:19:38.006 --> 01:19:40.275
WATER STORAGE PROJECTS OR I'M A

01:19:40.342 --> 01:19:41.476
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN THAT

01:19:41.543 --> 01:19:44.713
THEY WERE- SET IN. AND VINYL

01:19:44.779 --> 01:19:46.348
WHICH DOES NOT INCLUDE AS YOU AS

01:19:46.414 --> 01:19:47.749
YOU MENTIONED KIND OF A CURRENCY

01:19:47.816 --> 01:19:49.618
FOR EXEMPTION SO. I DON'T KNOW

01:19:49.684 --> 01:19:51.686
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I DON'T

01:19:51.753 --> 01:19:52.754
KNOW ANYTHING THAT WOULD

01:19:52.821 --> 01:19:53.388
NECESSARILY PRECLUDE- A SEQUEL

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:55.390
EXEMPTION BUT WOULD JUST TO SAY

01:19:55.457 --> 01:19:56.525
THAT THE PROCESS THAT'S BEEN

01:19:56.591 --> 01:19:58.293
ESTABLISH AND- IN PROP ONE IS.

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.629
IS SOMEWHAT PURPOSEFUL AND THAT

01:20:00.695 --> 01:20:01.963
THERE ARE SEVERAL STEPS THAT

01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:03.932
KIND OF NEED TO BE- THEY NEED TO

01:20:03.999 --> 01:20:05.200
BE TAKEN. I THINK THE OTHER

01:20:05.267 --> 01:20:06.434
THING HERE IS THAT WE'RE THERE

01:20:06.501 --> 01:20:08.670
WE'RE ASKING FOR IS TOO QUICK

01:20:08.737 --> 01:20:09.704
SECTION FOR THE FOR THE- THE

01:20:09.771 --> 01:20:11.740
WATER BOARD A STATE ENTITY TO.

01:20:11.806 --> 01:20:13.141
TO DO THAT WORSE IS THE PROP ONE

01:20:13.208 --> 01:20:14.609
PROJECTS WHICH ARE REALLY. I'M

01:20:14.676 --> 01:20:17.112
KIND OF LOCALLY DRIVEN- PROJECTS

01:20:17.179 --> 01:20:18.780
AND I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT. THE

01:20:18.847 --> 01:20:20.215
WATER STORAGE INVESTMENT PROGRAM

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:22.150
IS UNDERTAKING CONSTRUCTION

01:20:22.217 --> 01:20:24.519
RELATED ACTIVITIES- IN MANY

01:20:24.586 --> 01:20:26.922
CASES WHEREAS THE STATE WATER

01:20:26.988 --> 01:20:28.957
BOARDS INTERIM PLAN ACTIVITIES

01:20:29.024 --> 01:20:31.059
ARE. UNLIKELY DO SO THESE ARE

01:20:31.126 --> 01:20:33.795
MORE LIKELY TO BE- RESTRICTIONS

01:20:33.862 --> 01:20:35.530
ON PUMPING FOR EXAMPLE OR

01:20:35.597 --> 01:20:36.431
REQUIREMENTS TO COLLECT

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:39.367
INFORMATION. RATHER THAN ACTUAL-

THE STATE FOCUS ITS LIMITED

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:47.228
WHY YOU KNOW THE MINISTRATION

01:27:47.295 --> 01:27:48.329

SOURCE OF POLLUTION SURE- SO. I

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:03.664
THINK AND I THINK PART OF THE

01:30:03.731 --> 01:30:04.599
QUESTION IS WHY NOT MOBILE

01:30:04.665 --> 01:30:05.266

HERE WOULD BE COMPLEMENTARY TO

01:32:10.091 --> 01:32:11.292
OUR EXISTING AIR MONITORING

01:32:11.359 --> 01:32:13.794
PROGRAMS- SUCH AS THE REFINERY

01:32:13.861 --> 01:32:16.330

01:32:16.397 --> 01:32:18.833
COMMUNITY MONITORING ENGAGEMENT

01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:21.435

ABOUT OIL AND GAS FACILITIES

01:32:24.572 --> 01:32:25.907
SPECIFICALLY SO THE AIR

01:32:25.973 --> 01:32:27.775
MONITORING IS A LITTLE MORE

01:32:27.842 --> 01:32:29.110
HOLISTIC AND WERE RECEIVING

EXISTING PROGRAMS AREN'T REALLY

01:32:34.448 --> 01:32:35.950
DESIGNED TO ANSWER OR

01:32:36.017 --> 01:32:36.817
INVESTIGATE THOSE TYPES OF

01:32:36.884 --> 01:32:39.587
CONCERNS- AND SO BY WORKING WITH

01:32:39.654 --> 01:32:41.455
FAIR DISTRICTS STAFF- WE CAN

01:32:41.522 --> 01:32:42.957

INCREASE TRANSPARENCY- WHICH

01:32:46.894 --> 01:32:48.195
WILL HELP BUILD TRUST BETWEEN

THE COMMUNITIES AND AIR QUALITY

01:32:49.363 --> 01:32:52.233
REGULATORS- AND THEN WHAT WE CAN

01:33:06.013 --> 01:33:07.448
COMPLIMENTARY TO OUR EXISTING

01:33:07.515 --> 01:33:10.151
RESOURCES- FILLING SORT OF A GAP

01:33:10.217 --> 01:33:11.218
THAT WE DON'T HAVE AT THE

01:33:11.285 --> 01:33:13.888
MOMENT. WHICH IS WHY YOU THINK

01:33:13.955 --> 01:33:15.756

CARB SO CAL JIM- REGULATE SORT

01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:23.731
OF THE EXTRACTION BUT THE LOCAL

AIR DISTRICTS REGULATE AIR

01:33:25.533 --> 01:33:26.334
EMISSIONS AND THEN CORPORATE

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:28.369

RESPONSIBILITIES AND

01:33:49.357 --> 01:33:50.358
INVESTIGATING OUR OWN

01:33:50.424 --> 01:33:53.494
REGULATIONS- WILL BE ABLE WERE

01:33:53.561 --> 01:33:55.262
IN SORT OF A BETTER POSITION TO

PROGRAMMATIC IMPROVEMENTS THAT

01:34:07.641 --> 01:34:09.810
MIGHT NEED TO BE MADE. EIGHT

MODEST AT SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY

01:34:19.153 --> 01:34:20.755
SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND IF WE

01:34:20.821 --> 01:34:21.989
WERE TO- ASK ANOTHER AGENCY TO

01:34:22.056 --> 01:34:23.624

MAYBE I CAN ASK FOR

01:34:38.939 --> 01:34:40.508
CLARIFICATION- WHY I THINK THE

01:34:40.574 --> 01:34:42.743
THIRD QUESTION FROM DELEO IS WHY

01:34:42.810 --> 01:34:44.712
NOT THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS.

01:34:44.779 --> 01:34:47.681
INSTEAD OF CARP. REYES THE LOCAL

01:34:47.748 --> 01:34:49.016

REGULATE- THE SOURCES OF

01:34:51.218 --> 01:34:53.821
EMISSIONS- BUT AGAIN- CARB IS

01:34:53.888 --> 01:34:55.990
RECEIVING SEVERAL COMPLAINTS

01:34:56.057 --> 01:34:58.025
ABOUT ISSUES- THAT THEY'RE

01:34:58.092 --> 01:35:00.061
EXPERIENCING FROM THE SOURCES

01:35:00.127 --> 01:35:02.963
AND SO CARB. THROUGH ITS DIRECT

01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:04.698
ENFORCEMENT OF OUR METHANE

01:35:04.765 --> 01:35:06.233
REGULATIONS AND OUR OVERSIGHT

01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:08.335
RESPONSIBILITIES CAN SURE ENSURE

01:35:08.402 --> 01:35:09.804
MORE CONSISTENT SORT OF

01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:11.539
STATEWIDE ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE.

01:35:11.605 --> 01:35:12.706
PROVIDE A SUPPORT TO THE

01:35:12.773 --> 01:35:17.111
DISTRICTS- TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE-

01:35:17.178 --> 01:35:18.712
AND YOU KNOW IDENTIFIES SORT OF

01:35:18.779 --> 01:35:21.348
ANY HOLISTIC- PROBE PROGRAMMATIC

01:35:21.415 --> 01:35:22.817
IMPROVEMENTS THAT MAYBE COULD BE

01:35:22.883 --> 01:35:24.885
MADE TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE AS

01:35:24.952 --> 01:35:26.987
HEALTH PROTECTIVE AS POSSIBLE.

01:35:27.054 --> 01:35:28.956
SALEMME DEL DOWNLOADED DEEPER.

01:35:29.023 --> 01:35:30.124
ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE LOCAL

01:35:30.191 --> 01:35:31.292
DISTRICTS CAN'T DO IT OR ARE

01:35:31.358 --> 01:35:33.994
DOING A GOOD JOB A WHITE MALE.

01:35:34.061 --> 01:35:34.795
IF YOU'RE GETTING COMPLAINTS I'M

01:35:34.862 --> 01:35:36.263
ASSUMING THE LOWER DESERTING THE

01:35:36.330 --> 01:35:39.100
SAME COMPLAINTS SO WHY TO

01:35:39.166 --> 01:35:40.701
DUPLICATION. THAT'S A GOOD

01:35:40.768 --> 01:35:42.069
QUESTION- AND I THINK THAT'S WHY

01:35:42.136 --> 01:35:44.004
WE WOULD LIKE SOME RESOURCES TO

01:35:44.071 --> 01:35:45.973
MAYBE DELVE INTO THAT A LITTLE

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:47.842
BIT MORE- IT COULD BE THAT-

01:35:47.908 --> 01:35:49.276
THINGS ARE NOT BEING ADDRESSED

01:35:49.343 --> 01:35:50.578
NOT SURE WHY THAT WOULD BE THE

01:35:50.644 --> 01:35:53.380
CASE- BUT AGAIN CARB HAS

01:35:53.447 --> 01:35:55.349
OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY THAT WE'VE

01:35:55.416 --> 01:35:57.852
HAD FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND WE

01:35:57.918 --> 01:35:59.887
THINK THAT THIS IS SORT OF IN

01:35:59.954 --> 01:36:00.688
LINE WITH THOUGHT-

01:36:00.754 --> 01:36:02.556
RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP SORT OF

01:36:02.623 --> 01:36:04.758
IDENTIFY WHY THAT'S HAPPENING

01:36:04.825 --> 01:36:07.094
AND WHY THAT'S THE CASE. SAID SO

01:36:07.161 --> 01:36:10.164
JUST BE CLEAR YOU DON'T KNOW IF

01:36:10.231 --> 01:36:10.764
THERE'S ANY PROBLEMS YOU JUST.

01:36:10.831 --> 01:36:16.337
WANT TO DO IT. I MEAN WE SEE

01:36:16.403 --> 01:36:17.471
THAT THERE ARE ISSUES BECAUSE

01:36:17.538 --> 01:36:20.374
WE'RE RECEIVING COMPLAINTS- BUT

01:36:20.441 --> 01:36:21.575
TO UNDERSTAND IN MORE DEPTH

01:36:21.642 --> 01:36:23.477
MAYBE WHAT THOSE ISSUES ARE WE

01:36:23.544 --> 01:36:25.112
NEED SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

01:36:25.179 --> 01:36:26.981
ARC WE HAVE CURRENT OVERSIGHT

01:36:27.047 --> 01:36:29.316
ACTIVITIES THAT WE DO PERFORM-

01:36:29.383 --> 01:36:31.285
NOT SPECIFIC TO A OIL AND GAS

01:36:31.352 --> 01:36:33.120
AND SO AS A RESULT OF RECEIVING

01:36:33.187 --> 01:36:34.255
THESE COMPLAINTS WE WOULD LIKE

01:36:34.321 --> 01:36:36.257
TO. DELVE INTO THAT INFO WE HAVE

01:36:36.323 --> 01:36:38.058
A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THAT OKAY

01:36:38.125 --> 01:36:39.460
BUT YOU HAVE YOU HAVE NO REASON

01:36:39.527 --> 01:36:41.762
TO BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE JUST THE

01:36:41.829 --> 01:36:43.030
LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS ARE NOT

01:36:43.097 --> 01:36:44.532
DOING A GOOD JOB I PERSONALLY.

01:36:44.598 --> 01:36:46.200
DON'T KNOW THAT. OKAY IT MAYBE I

01:36:46.267 --> 01:36:48.202
CAN HAS L. L. A. IS THERE A

01:36:48.269 --> 01:36:49.436
SITUATION WHERE. ARE THEY ARE

01:36:49.503 --> 01:36:52.206
DISTRICTS NOT DOING. SOMETHING

01:36:52.273 --> 01:36:54.775
THAT THEY CARP NEED TO DO. I

01:36:54.842 --> 01:36:57.611
MEAN I DON'T THINK- EXAMPLES OF

01:36:57.678 --> 01:36:59.947
THAT HAVE SORT OF BEEN PRESENTED

01:37:00.014 --> 01:37:02.016
TO US- I KNOW THERE WAS. SOME

01:37:02.082 --> 01:37:03.851
MENTION THAT AND THE BOARD'S

01:37:03.918 --> 01:37:05.819
PRESENTATION OF KIND OF SOME

01:37:05.886 --> 01:37:07.321
INSPECTIONS THAT THEY WERE DOING

01:37:07.388 --> 01:37:08.322
WITH LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS THAT'S

01:37:08.389 --> 01:37:10.257
KIND OF HIS PARTLY DRIVEN.

01:37:10.324 --> 01:37:11.659
THAT'S HERE THEY DID FIND SOME

01:37:11.725 --> 01:37:13.494
LEAKS BUT I GUESS IT'S UNCLEAR

01:37:13.561 --> 01:37:15.296
TO US KIND OF. WEATHER THAT

01:37:15.362 --> 01:37:16.697
WOULD HAVE BEEN KIND OF CAUGHT

01:37:16.764 --> 01:37:18.232
BY LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS ALONG THE

01:37:18.299 --> 01:37:20.234
WAY ANYWAYS OR YOU KNOW HOW KIND

01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:22.203
OF PREVALENCE OF SOME OF THOSE

01:37:22.269 --> 01:37:23.537
PROBLEMS MIGHT BE SO I GUESS THE

01:37:23.604 --> 01:37:25.539
SHORT ANSWER IS WE ARE. AWARE OF

01:37:25.606 --> 01:37:27.308
A LOT OF SPECIFIC EXAMPLES WELL

01:37:27.374 --> 01:37:29.210
LET ME ASK CARP IN THIS QUESTION

01:37:29.276 --> 01:37:32.012
DO YOU GET COMPLAINTS. FROM

01:37:32.079 --> 01:37:35.282
OTHER INDUSTRIES. WE DO GET

01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:36.016
COMPLAINTS FROM OTHER

01:37:36.083 --> 01:37:38.285
INDUSTRIES- WE DO RECEIVE A LOT

01:37:38.352 --> 01:37:39.820
OF MOBILE SOURCE AND- PROGRAM

01:37:39.887 --> 01:37:41.188
COMPLAINTS AS WELL WHICH WE-

01:37:41.255 --> 01:37:45.392
INVESTIGATE- WE DO- BUT WE ALSO

01:37:45.459 --> 01:37:46.594
RECEIVED SEVERAL COMPLAINTS

01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:48.829
RELATED TO THE OIL AND GAS

01:37:48.896 --> 01:37:50.097
INDUSTRY- THE ONE THING I WILL

01:37:50.164 --> 01:37:51.365
HIGHLIGHT AS WE HAVE GONE OUT

01:37:51.432 --> 01:37:53.300
AND DONE JOINT INSPECTIONS WITH

01:37:53.367 --> 01:37:54.935
DISTRICTS WE HAVE IDENTIFIED-

01:37:55.002 --> 01:37:56.604
EXIGENCES. OF EMISSIONS

01:37:56.670 --> 01:37:58.639
REGULATIONS FOR EXAMPLE- AND

01:37:58.706 --> 01:38:00.274
HAVE WORKED WITH THE DISTRICT TO

01:38:00.341 --> 01:38:01.976
RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES- BUT

01:38:02.042 --> 01:38:03.644
SOMETIMES A YOU KNOW IT TAKES A

01:38:03.711 --> 01:38:05.613
SORT OF. OF GOING IN THERE AND

01:38:05.679 --> 01:38:07.448
DO NOT A VALUATION UNDERSTAND

01:38:07.514 --> 01:38:09.149
WHAT THE ISSUE IS AND HELP TRY

01:38:09.216 --> 01:38:11.252
TO RESOLVE IT. OKAY SO THEN- SO

01:38:11.318 --> 01:38:13.420
AND WHEN YOU GO AND MADE SAID I

01:38:13.487 --> 01:38:15.522
USED TO PLAY SO YOU SAY YOUR

01:38:15.589 --> 01:38:16.290
COMPLIMENTARY SET AND IS THERE

01:38:16.357 --> 01:38:18.859
DISTRICTS DO THEIR THING AND YOU

01:38:18.926 --> 01:38:20.194
DO YOUR THING OR DO YOU GUYS GO

01:38:20.261 --> 01:38:22.196
IN TOGETHER. IT SEEMS LIKE YOU

01:38:22.263 --> 01:38:24.198
GOT TWO LAYERS KIND OF COMING IN

01:38:24.265 --> 01:38:25.633
TOGETHER. WE DO GO IN TOGETHER

01:38:25.699 --> 01:38:26.233
WE OFTEN DO JOINT INSPECTIONS

01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:27.601
WITH THEIR DISTRICTS. OKAY BUT-

01:38:27.668 --> 01:38:29.136
WHY WOULD YOU GO THERE I GUESS

01:38:29.203 --> 01:38:31.538
THE QUESTION IS WHY WOULD YOU GO

01:38:31.605 --> 01:38:33.007
WITH THE LOCAL DISTRICTS AND

01:38:33.073 --> 01:38:34.141
LOCAL LOCAL AIR DISCONTENT

01:38:34.208 --> 01:38:35.676
THEMSELVES. TO ENSURE THAT ALL

01:38:35.743 --> 01:38:39.913
OF THE- THE- REGULATIONS ARE

01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:42.082
BEING COMPLIED WITH- TWO PART

01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:44.051
SO. MAYBE TAKING A STEP BACK

01:38:44.118 --> 01:38:45.619
PART OF OUR OVERSIGHT ROLE

01:38:45.686 --> 01:38:47.388
INCLUDES EVALUATING DISTRICT

01:38:47.454 --> 01:38:48.155
PROGRAMS TUITION INSURE THEIR

01:38:48.222 --> 01:38:50.090
EFFECTIVENESS- AND SO THAT'S

01:38:50.157 --> 01:38:52.226

SEE WHAT THE ISSUES ARE SORT OF

01:38:58.666 --> 01:39:00.567
DO THAT TYPE OF EVALUATION TO

01:39:00.634 --> 01:39:03.971
ENSURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AIR.

01:39:04.038 --> 01:39:05.072
AIR QUALITY REGULATIONS ACROSS

01:39:05.139 --> 01:39:08.709
THE STATE OKAY SO YOU BASIC

01:39:08.776 --> 01:39:11.945
CHECKING ON THEIR DISTRICTS. I

01:39:12.012 --> 01:39:13.847
SUPPOSE YOU COULD SAY THAT YEAH

01:39:13.914 --> 01:39:14.415
I MEAN THAT'S PART OF OUR

01:39:14.481 --> 01:39:17.384
OVERSIGHT ROLE. OKAY YEAH. THANK

YOU KNOW JUST HAVE A COULD BE

01:39:20.587 --> 01:39:22.256
IMPROVED YOU GO TO THE OIL AND

01:39:22.323 --> 01:39:25.225
GAS FACILITIES BUT ARE WE

01:39:25.292 --> 01:39:26.393
MONITORING OFF SHORE WITH ALL

01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:28.429
THE- TANKERS AND SHIPS THAT HAVE

01:39:28.495 --> 01:39:30.230
BEEN OFF THE COAST FOR THE LAST

01:39:30.297 --> 01:39:32.866
YEAR. IN COMPARISON TO WHAT ON

01:39:32.933 --> 01:39:35.169
LONG DISTANCE ON LAND VERSUS THE

01:39:35.235 --> 01:39:37.304
OCEAN BECAUSE THAT AIR HOME IT'S

01:39:37.371 --> 01:39:38.806
COMING ON IS THERE COMPARISON OR

01:39:38.872 --> 01:39:40.474
ANY STUDIES THAT WERE IN THE

01:39:40.541 --> 01:39:42.376
LAST YEAR THAT HAVE BEEN UP

01:39:42.443 --> 01:39:43.610
THERE WITH THE CAR. THAT IS A

01:39:43.677 --> 01:39:45.646
VERY GOOD QUESTION AND I DO NOT

01:39:45.713 --> 01:39:47.348
KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT-

01:39:47.414 --> 01:39:48.682
EVERYTHING THAT I AM SORT OF

01:39:48.749 --> 01:39:50.184
INVOLVED IN AND AWARE OF IS MORE

01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:51.985
OF THE- THE DRILLING THAT'S

01:39:52.052 --> 01:39:52.619
OCCURRING ON LANDS. IS A TOPIC

01:39:52.686 --> 01:39:53.921
THAT SORT YEAH CONCENTRATING

01:39:53.987 --> 01:39:55.489
HERE BUT WE GOT A BIG PROBLEM

01:39:55.556 --> 01:39:57.925
OUT HERE IN THE OCEAN. AND THAT

01:39:57.991 --> 01:39:59.193
ERROR I MEAN THERE'S NOT A FINE

01:39:59.259 --> 01:40:00.494
LINE WHERE DOESN'T COME ACROSS

01:40:00.561 --> 01:40:02.863
THE BASE SO WHEN WE GET THAT

01:40:02.930 --> 01:40:06.166
MAYBE YOU CAN. GET THAT ANSWER

01:40:06.233 --> 01:40:10.170
FOR. SURE NOT THAT I'M THE

01:40:10.237 --> 01:40:11.438
AUTHORITY ON THE SUBJECT LINE OF

01:40:11.505 --> 01:40:13.207
THE PORTS OF TAKING A LOT OF

01:40:13.273 --> 01:40:15.709
RESPONSIBILITY FOR- MAKING SURE

01:40:15.776 --> 01:40:19.146
THAT- OF THOSE- SHIPS THAT ARE-

01:40:19.213 --> 01:40:21.048
AWAITING BOOK- BEING UNLOADED.

01:40:21.115 --> 01:40:23.350
ARE STAGING AND THE MANY OF THEM

01:40:23.417 --> 01:40:24.818
ARE REMAINING OUT TO AT SEA

01:40:24.885 --> 01:40:26.620
BEFORE THEY COME IN. SO THAT

01:40:26.687 --> 01:40:29.656
THERE'S LESS POLLUTION AND-

01:40:29.723 --> 01:40:31.859
DIRECTLY IN THE PORT AREAS. LET

01:40:31.925 --> 01:40:33.527
THAT'S ONE STEPS THAT THEY'VE

01:40:33.594 --> 01:40:35.162
TAKEN. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US

01:40:35.229 --> 01:40:37.498
OF EXPERT BUT THAT. AIR IN THE

01:40:37.564 --> 01:40:39.133
OCEAN. WE GET ON SHORE FLOW IT

01:40:39.199 --> 01:40:41.735
COMES ON THE LAND OH TO BE SURE

01:40:41.802 --> 01:40:42.569
HAVE SOME KIND OF COMPARISON AND

01:40:42.636 --> 01:40:43.737
CHECK BECAUSE WE'RE GOING AFTER

01:40:43.804 --> 01:40:45.272
THE- OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY. BUT

01:40:45.339 --> 01:40:48.842
IF BECAUSE MIGHT BE OUT THE

01:40:48.909 --> 01:40:49.777
OCEAN WITH ALL THE SHIPS RIGHT

01:40:49.843 --> 01:40:50.644
NOW. THEY WERE BLAMING WHAT

01:40:50.711 --> 01:40:52.980
WE'RE DOING OVER HERE SO AT OF

01:40:53.046 --> 01:40:54.148
THE THINK WE NEED A COMPARISON.

01:40:54.214 --> 01:40:56.183
AND A LOOK AT IT. AND WE CAN

01:40:56.250 --> 01:40:58.285
DELIVER HERE A LOT BETTER THAN

01:40:58.352 --> 01:40:58.852
THEY DO IN OTHER COUNTRIES

01:40:58.919 --> 01:41:00.220
BECAUSE IF WE'RE STILL IMPORT

01:41:00.287 --> 01:41:01.955
THE SAME AMOUNT OF IL. WE'RE

01:41:02.022 --> 01:41:03.657
STILL USING THE SAME AMOUNT. AND

01:41:03.724 --> 01:41:06.093

WILL TALK ABOUT A- A- UNIVERSITY

01:44:15.949 --> 01:44:18.518
ITSELF THAT- WE WERE NOTIFIED BY

01:44:18.585 --> 01:44:20.520
AN HOUR GROWING IT DOESN'T NEED

01:44:20.587 --> 01:44:22.289
TO CAMPUS FIRE MARSHAL THAT THEY

01:44:22.356 --> 01:44:23.991

01:44:24.057 --> 01:44:27.561
ONLY ONE. ON THAT FACILITY- AND

01:44:27.628 --> 01:44:29.830
THAT THEY WOULD BE RETIRING. WE

01:44:29.896 --> 01:44:32.699
WILL. REACH OUT WE HEARD NOTHING

01:44:32.766 --> 01:44:35.502
FROM THE CAMPUS ITSELF- WE REACH

01:44:35.569 --> 01:44:37.104
OUT TO THE OFFICE OF THE

01:44:37.170 --> 01:44:38.705
PRESIDENT TO EXPLAIN- THAT WE

01:44:38.772 --> 01:44:40.807
NEEDED SOMEBODY IN THERE- THAT

01:44:40.874 --> 01:44:42.843
SINCE THAT AUTHORITY LIES WITH

01:44:42.909 --> 01:44:44.745
THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE

01:44:44.811 --> 01:44:46.580
THAT IT WAS IMPERATIVE THAT IF

01:44:46.647 --> 01:44:48.048
THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE SOMEBODY

01:44:48.115 --> 01:44:49.850
WE HAD TO HAVE SOMEBODY IN THERE

01:44:49.916 --> 01:44:53.086
SO WE- DID SOME CHANGING OF

01:44:53.153 --> 01:44:57.591
STAFFING AND RE DIRECTED STAFF

01:44:57.658 --> 01:45:00.661

AT THAT FACILITY- WAS QUITE

01:45:03.330 --> 01:45:06.667
CONCERNING WE FOUND- ISSUES

01:45:06.733 --> 01:45:10.137
WITH- THE CONSTRUCTION. THE

01:45:10.203 --> 01:45:12.706
OTHER- INSPECTIONS THAT WERE

01:45:12.773 --> 01:45:17.077
DONE AND- WE'RE REALLY TROUBLED

01:45:17.144 --> 01:45:19.079
BY THE SITUATION ESPECIALLY AS

01:45:19.146 --> 01:45:21.014
WE PUT PUT STAFF THERE TO DO

01:45:21.081 --> 01:45:23.283
THOSE INSPECTIONS IT BECAME MORE

01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:26.386
AND MORE OF A CONCERN TO US THAT

01:45:26.453 --> 01:45:28.955
THE ACTUAL AUTHORITY LIES WITHIN

01:45:29.022 --> 01:45:30.557
THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE.

WE'VE DELEGATED IT AND WE

01:45:32.392 --> 01:45:36.697
HAVEN'T. WE DIDN'T FOLLOW UP- IT

01:45:36.763 --> 01:45:38.298
OCCURRED TO US THAT WE REALLY

01:45:38.365 --> 01:45:40.000
REALLY NEEDED TO STEP UP THERE

01:45:40.067 --> 01:45:43.970
WAS HAS BEEN A- QUITE A BIT OF

01:45:44.037 --> 01:45:47.507

MAINTENANCE TO BE DONE AND OUR

01:45:56.850 --> 01:45:58.785
OUR GREAT CONCERN WAS THAT IT

01:45:58.852 --> 01:46:00.320
WOULDN'T BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH

01:46:00.387 --> 01:46:01.722

REJECTING THE PROPOSAL-

01:51:45.231 --> 01:51:46.933
BASICALLY WE DIDN'T FEEL THAT

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.501
THE FIRE MARSHALL HAD ADEQUATELY

01:51:48.568 --> 01:51:50.036
SUBSTANTIATED THE JUSTIFICATION

01:51:50.103 --> 01:51:52.939
AT THIS POINT- AND THERE ARE A

01:51:53.006 --> 01:51:53.640
COUPLE REASONS- ONE WE DIDN'T

01:51:53.706 --> 01:51:55.675
FEEL THAT WE GOT SUFFICIENT

01:51:55.742 --> 01:51:57.110
EVIDENCE WHEN WE WERE- DOING A

01:51:57.177 --> 01:52:00.046

01:52:10.757 --> 01:52:11.791

SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO BE ABLE

01:52:19.199 --> 01:52:20.867
TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER OR NOT.

01:52:20.934 --> 01:52:22.735

THE BEST SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM

01:52:45.158 --> 01:52:46.926
WOULD BE TO ESTABLISH A NEW UNIT

01:52:46.993 --> 01:52:48.328
WITH AND THE FIRE MARSHAL OR

01:52:48.394 --> 01:52:49.362

EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG EVERY

01:54:36.336 --> 01:54:37.203

A WAY THAT PROTECTS THE- THE

01:54:56.089 --> 01:54:57.423
STUDENTS AND STAFF AND FACULTY.

01:54:57.490 --> 01:54:59.826

TO ANYONE CAMPUS IT SEEMS

01:55:10.637 --> 01:55:12.805
RELATIVELY MODERATE. MODEST AND

01:55:12.872 --> 01:55:14.073
I ALSO JUST POINT OUT THAT THE

01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:15.308
STATE FARM MARSHALL'S OFFICE

01:55:15.375 --> 01:55:17.210
BILLS AN HOURLY RATE AND SO ANY

01:55:17.277 --> 01:55:18.611
CAMPUS THAT'S IN GOOD WORKING

01:55:18.678 --> 01:55:20.880

HIM- FILL A GAP IN SOME

01:55:32.392 --> 01:55:35.361
IMPORTANT HEALTH AND SAFETY.

01:55:35.428 --> 01:55:38.531
COMPLIANCE SO THE IDEA THAT THIS

01:55:38.598 --> 01:55:40.400
IS AN INTERESTING JURISDICTIONAL

01:55:40.466 --> 01:55:43.369
ISSUE WE HAVE THE- UNIVERSITY

01:55:43.436 --> 01:55:44.437
CALIFORNIA WHICH IS

01:55:44.504 --> 01:55:47.573
CONSTITUTIONALLY- PROTECTED IN

01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:51.311
MANY WAYS AS AN INDEPENDENT. TO

FIRE MARSHAL IS. CHARGED WITH.

01:56:00.653 --> 01:56:02.755
OVERSEEING THESE ASPECTS OF

01:56:02.822 --> 01:56:06.326
SAFETY ON CAMPUS WHY WHY WOULD

01:56:06.392 --> 01:56:10.997
WE NOT EXPECT. THE UC. TWO A

01:56:11.064 --> 01:56:13.966
COVER THE COST OF THE- BOTTOM.

01:56:14.033 --> 01:56:15.802
OF THAT OVERSIGHT INSPECTION.

01:56:15.868 --> 01:56:17.737
THE UC WOULD COVER THE COSTS OF

01:56:17.804 --> 01:56:20.173
THE DIVISION OF- FIRE LIFE

01:56:20.239 --> 01:56:21.841
SAFETY WAS NOT STATE FARM

01:56:21.908 --> 01:56:22.342
MARSHALL IS FUNDED ON A

01:56:22.408 --> 01:56:24.210
REIMBURSEMENT BASIS. SO THEY

01:56:24.277 --> 01:56:27.146
WITH THE CAMPUSES WOULD YOU SEE

01:56:27.213 --> 01:56:29.048
WOULD BE BILLED AND REIMBURSED.

01:56:29.115 --> 01:56:30.383
AFTER THE THREE POINT TWO

01:56:30.450 --> 01:56:32.385
MILLION DOLLARS- WOULD BE

01:56:32.452 --> 01:56:34.721

CITY REMARKS ALSO YOU IDENTIFIED

01:56:56.743 --> 01:56:59.812

THEM AT- AT CAL- A TO A C. L. A.

01:57:05.118 --> 01:57:07.420

FOUR PEOPLE- INSPECTORS OUT AT

CAL. DECIDES THAT CAMPUS ISN'T

01:57:23.236 --> 01:57:25.905
THAT MUCH DIFFERENT FROM UCLA

01:57:25.972 --> 01:57:28.341
AND YOU ONLY HAVE TO THEIR- IT

01:57:28.408 --> 01:57:29.575
SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S AN IMBALANCE

01:57:29.642 --> 01:57:32.745
AND THAT THE- COVERAGE WE WOULD

01:57:32.812 --> 01:57:35.581
NEED DOESN'T EXIST RIGHT NOW-

01:57:35.648 --> 01:57:36.516
YES THANK YOU FOR THE

01:57:36.582 --> 01:57:39.452
OPPORTUNITY- AS WE HAD DISCUSSED

01:57:39.519 --> 01:57:40.987
WITH THE UNIVERSITY OFFICE OF

01:57:41.053 --> 01:57:44.457
THE PRESIDENT IN REGARDS TO-

01:57:44.524 --> 01:57:46.259
THIS BUDGET CHANGE PROPELLER

THIS REQUEST AND- DISCUSS WITH

01:57:49.495 --> 01:57:52.365
THEM THOSE ISSUES IN PARTICULAR

01:57:52.432 --> 01:57:57.470
THE DISPARITY IN OF NUMBER OF-

01:57:57.537 --> 01:57:59.238
DESIGNATED CAMPUS FIRE MARSHALS.

01:57:59.305 --> 01:58:01.073
AT THE DIFFERENT FACILITIES NOW

01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:04.277
IT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW AGAIN

01:58:04.343 --> 01:58:06.879
THAT THE DESIGNATED CAMPUS FIRE

01:58:06.946 --> 01:58:08.748
MARSHALS WORK FOR THE SPECIFIC

01:58:08.815 --> 01:58:11.551
FACILITY SO THAT EACH EACH

01:58:11.617 --> 01:58:15.588
CAMPUS CAN HIRE AS MANY OR AS

01:58:15.655 --> 01:58:19.158
FEW AS THEY CHOOSE- THERE IS NOT

01:58:19.225 --> 01:58:21.928
A MINIMUM NUMBER. MAY I

01:58:21.994 --> 01:58:24.230
INTERRUPT AND JUST GAS THAT THAT

01:58:24.297 --> 01:58:26.232
IS THROUGH AUTHORITY THAT IS

01:58:26.299 --> 01:58:28.868
DELEGATED FROM THE STATE FIRE

01:58:28.935 --> 01:58:31.938
MARSHAL'S OFFICE IS THAT CORRECT

01:58:32.004 --> 01:58:35.341
THAT'S CORRECT THE- WELL AND THE

01:58:35.408 --> 01:58:37.643
HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE. I HATE

01:58:37.710 --> 01:58:39.645
DOING THIS WITHOUT IT IN FRONT

01:58:39.712 --> 01:58:43.449
OF ME- I BELIEVE IT ALLOWS US TO

01:58:43.516 --> 01:58:46.619
DELEGATE- A DESIGNATED CAMPUS

01:58:46.686 --> 01:58:52.425
FIRE MARSHAL TO THE FACILITY. SO

01:58:52.492 --> 01:58:53.526
THAT'S THAT'S WHERE IT COMES

01:58:53.593 --> 01:58:57.497
FROM. AND SOMEHOW ALONG THE WAY

01:58:57.563 --> 01:58:59.599
IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S BEEN A

01:58:59.665 --> 01:59:01.868
BREAK DOWN AND SORT OF THE FLOW

01:59:01.934 --> 01:59:03.870
OF INFORMATION AND OVERSIGHT AND

01:59:03.936 --> 01:59:06.172
COMMUNICATION AND PERHAPS

01:59:06.239 --> 01:59:09.675
ACCOUNTABILITY BETWEEN- THE UC

01:59:09.742 --> 01:59:11.611
AND THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL

01:59:11.677 --> 01:59:15.147
THAT'S CORRECT- WE DID START

01:59:15.214 --> 01:59:17.416
HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

01:59:17.483 --> 01:59:18.951
UNIVERSITY OFFICE OF THE

01:59:19.018 --> 01:59:22.088
PRESIDENT- TO TRY TO- THEY HAVE

01:59:22.154 --> 01:59:25.057
TAKEN ON THE ROLE- TO TRY TO

01:59:25.124 --> 01:59:27.460
ADMINISTER THAT INFORMATION FROM

01:59:27.527 --> 01:59:29.996
EACH OF THE CAMPUSES IN ONE

01:59:30.062 --> 01:59:32.965
PLACE. BUT THE DESIGNATION IS

01:59:33.032 --> 01:59:38.037
SPECIFIC TO THOSE CAMPUSES. IS

01:59:38.104 --> 01:59:43.109
THERE A- I I'M- AWARE OF- A

01:59:43.175 --> 01:59:45.745
SHORTAGE OF- FIREFIGHTERS AND

01:59:45.811 --> 01:59:47.647
PARAMEDICS IN THE STATE IS MY

01:59:47.713 --> 01:59:49.549
SON'S A FIREFIGHTER PARAMEDIC

01:59:49.615 --> 01:59:53.386
AND HE REPORTS AND MAKE. BUT BUT

01:59:53.452 --> 01:59:54.854
I KNOW THAT THERE'S A SHORTAGE

01:59:54.921 --> 01:59:57.490
PARTLY BECAUSE OF- OF

01:59:57.557 --> 01:59:59.825
RETIREMENTS IS THAT PART OF

01:59:59.892 --> 02:00:03.529
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE ALSO THAT-

02:00:03.596 --> 02:00:06.165
RETIREMENT CIRQUE CELEBRATING.

02:00:06.232 --> 02:00:07.967
AS THEY ARE IN MANY SECTORS OF

02:00:08.034 --> 02:00:10.436
THE ECONOMY AND- POSITIONS ARE

02:00:10.503 --> 02:00:12.104
NOT BEING FILLED THIS QUICKLY

02:00:12.171 --> 02:00:14.840
THAT KIND OF THING. YES THAT IS

02:00:14.907 --> 02:00:16.375
THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT THAT WE

02:00:16.442 --> 02:00:18.277
HAVE AND IT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES

02:00:18.344 --> 02:00:20.313
THAT LED US HERE WAS- THROUGH

02:00:20.379 --> 02:00:22.682
ATTRITION AT BOTH THE STATE FIRE

02:00:22.748 --> 02:00:25.585
MARSHAL'S OFFICE AS WELL AS AT

02:00:25.651 --> 02:00:27.820
THE DESIGNATED CAMPUS FIRE

02:00:27.887 --> 02:00:30.056
MARSHAL UP ALL THOSE CONNECTIONS

02:00:30.122 --> 02:00:32.992
THAT PEOPLE HAD. JUST SORT OF-

02:00:33.059 --> 02:00:37.964
DEVOLVED- AWAY AND WHICH YOU

02:00:38.030 --> 02:00:39.565
KNOW SOMEBODY NEW COMES IN AND

02:00:39.632 --> 02:00:45.137
EVERYONE IS BUSY- SO THE TIME TO

02:00:45.204 --> 02:00:47.139
MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS I THINK

02:00:47.206 --> 02:00:49.809
ARE HARDER- I THINK WE'RE COMING

02:00:49.875 --> 02:00:52.745
OUT OF THAT NOW- AS WE GET TO

02:00:52.812 --> 02:00:55.748
SEE EACH OTHER IN PERSON. THAT I

02:00:55.815 --> 02:00:57.583
THINK THAT THERE IS AN ABSOLUTE

02:00:57.650 --> 02:01:00.152
INTEREST FOR PEOPLE TO MEET NEW

02:01:00.219 --> 02:01:01.854
PEOPLE AND ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY

02:01:01.921 --> 02:01:04.023
SEE NEW PEOPLE AND DEVELOP THOSE

02:01:04.090 --> 02:01:06.292
CONNECTIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS

02:01:06.359 --> 02:01:08.327
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE

02:01:08.394 --> 02:01:10.363
DONE- EIGHT THERE ARE DEFINITE

02:01:10.429 --> 02:01:14.300
BENEFITS TO THIS PROGRAM. BY IT

02:01:14.367 --> 02:01:16.369
THERE THERE IS I'M NOT TRYING

02:01:16.435 --> 02:01:17.837
I'M NOT HERE TRYING TO SAY THAT

02:01:17.903 --> 02:01:22.141
THIS PROGRAM IS INEFFECTIVE OR-

02:01:22.208 --> 02:01:24.777
OR DOESN'T NECESSARILY WORK BUT

02:01:24.844 --> 02:01:28.514
WE JUST DON'T KNOW. AND WHERE

02:01:28.581 --> 02:01:31.984
THAT AUTHORITY IT ESPECIALLY

02:01:32.051 --> 02:01:34.487
WHEN WE LOOK AT PLACES THAT HAVE

02:01:34.553 --> 02:01:35.588
YOU KNOW PEOPLE SEND THEIR

02:01:35.655 --> 02:01:41.794
CHILDREN AND- THE- THOSE

02:01:41.861 --> 02:01:44.997
CAMPUSES ARE JUST SUCH HUBS OF

02:01:45.064 --> 02:01:49.568
ACTIVITY AND INFORMATION AND-

02:01:49.635 --> 02:01:53.506
GATHERINGS AND EDUCATION THAT IT

02:01:53.572 --> 02:01:55.141
WOULD JUST BE REALLY GREAT TO

02:01:55.207 --> 02:01:56.709
KNOW FOR SURE THAT THEY WERE

02:01:56.776 --> 02:01:59.145
CONSTRUCTED APPROPRIATELY SO-

02:01:59.211 --> 02:02:03.616
ARE YOU GIVING THOUGHT TO- AT-

02:02:03.683 --> 02:02:07.319

ON YOU GIVING THOUGHT TO THE

02:02:18.631 --> 02:02:21.133
POSSIBILITY OF RESTRUCTURING-

THE PROGRAM HOW LONG HOW LONG IS

02:02:23.469 --> 02:02:25.638
THIS- DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY

02:02:25.705 --> 02:02:32.178
BEEN AND- IT CAME IN IN. WAS IT

INFORMAL- DELEGATION AT THAT

02:02:48.461 --> 02:02:51.330
TIME IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN THE

FIRE MARSHAL SAID WE SHOULD

02:04:01.834 --> 02:04:05.404
MORE OF AN OVERSIGHT IS THE

02:04:05.471 --> 02:04:08.073
THOUGHT PROCESS- REVIEWING THEIR

02:04:08.140 --> 02:04:10.276
INSPECTIONS MAY BE GOING TO A

02:04:10.342 --> 02:04:11.277
BUILDING THAT'S UNDER

02:04:11.343 --> 02:04:13.312
CONSTRUCTION AND TAKING A LOOK

02:04:13.379 --> 02:04:14.647
TO BE SURE THAT THAT THINGS

02:04:14.713 --> 02:04:17.850
WEREN'T WEREN'T MESSED- THERE IS

02:04:17.917 --> 02:04:23.522

DAMPER INSTEAD OF A SMOKE FIRE

02:04:31.897 --> 02:04:33.833
DAMPER WHICH IS REQUIRED BY

02:04:33.899 --> 02:04:36.635
STATE REGULATIONS THAT COULD END

02:04:36.702 --> 02:04:38.404
UP COSTING QUITE A BIT DOWN THE

02:04:38.470 --> 02:04:42.341
ROAD SO- TRYING TO BE SURE THAT

02:04:42.408 --> 02:04:44.777
WE ARE SPENDING MORE MONEY DOWN

02:04:44.844 --> 02:04:47.379
THE ROAD- OR THAT THE FACILITY

02:04:47.446 --> 02:04:48.647
IS AND SPENDING MORE MONEY DOWN

02:04:48.714 --> 02:04:50.783
THE ROAD THAT THEY DON'T HAVE

02:04:50.850 --> 02:04:53.919
TO- IS. IS NEVER SHOULD NEVER BE

02:04:53.986 --> 02:04:54.920
PAINFUL- FINDING A MISTAKE

02:04:54.987 --> 02:04:57.857
EARLIER THAN LATER IS OFTEN THIS

02:04:57.923 --> 02:04:59.758
IS FOR DENNIS NEW CONSTRUCTION

02:04:59.825 --> 02:05:02.695
THAT. WOULD BE THROUGHOUT TO- GO

02:05:02.761 --> 02:05:05.664
THROUGH AND BE SURE EVEN THAT- A

02:05:05.731 --> 02:05:07.333
LOT OF TIMES WHAT HAPPENS ON

02:05:07.399 --> 02:05:10.469
CAMPUSES IS YOU HAVE ONE

02:05:10.536 --> 02:05:12.471
INSTRUCTOR THAT WANTS TO DO ONE

02:05:12.538 --> 02:05:13.806
THING. THEY LEAVE THE NEXT'S

02:05:13.873 --> 02:05:15.808
INSTRUCTOR COMES IN- PROFESSOR

02:05:15.875 --> 02:05:17.276
COMES IN AND THEY WANT TO

02:05:17.343 --> 02:05:20.679
REARRANGE- ALL ROOM AND MAYBE

02:05:20.746 --> 02:05:23.916
THEY WANT THEY HAVE THEIR OWN-

02:05:23.983 --> 02:05:25.484
EQUIPMENT THAT COMES IN WELL

02:05:25.551 --> 02:05:27.920
MAYBE IT BLOCKS AN EXIT. SO

02:05:27.987 --> 02:05:29.622
THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS

02:05:29.688 --> 02:05:31.223
THAT NEED TO BE REVIEWED TO BE

02:05:31.290 --> 02:05:32.558
SURE THAT YOU ARE MAINTAINING

02:05:32.625 --> 02:05:33.893
THAT EXITING FOR EVERYBODY

02:05:33.959 --> 02:05:37.496
THAT'S USING THAT FACILITY. SO

02:05:37.563 --> 02:05:39.565
THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF SPOT

02:05:39.632 --> 02:05:42.501
CHECKS THAT ARE DONE THERE ARE-

02:05:42.568 --> 02:05:44.637
INSPECTIONS THAT ARE DONE ON ALL

02:05:44.703 --> 02:05:47.373
THE HIGH RISES- I WAS REVIEWING

02:05:47.439 --> 02:05:48.707
SOME OF THEM YESTERDAY THERE

02:05:48.774 --> 02:05:50.643
ARE. DEFICIENCIES THAT WERE

02:05:50.709 --> 02:05:52.811
NOTED BY THE DESIGNATED CAMPUS

02:05:52.878 --> 02:05:57.016
FIRE MARSHALS AND SO IN. IN MY

02:05:57.082 --> 02:05:59.318
VIEW OF THIS PROGRAM IT WOULD

02:05:59.385 --> 02:06:01.353
BE- SOMEONE FROM OUR OFFICE

02:06:01.420 --> 02:06:02.922
GOING BACK TO BE SURE THAT THOSE

02:06:02.988 --> 02:06:04.490
ISSUES HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED.

02:06:04.556 --> 02:06:06.659
BECAUSE IF THEY ARE ADDRESSED

02:06:06.725 --> 02:06:11.063
AND ARE BEING IGNORED THEN- WE

02:06:11.130 --> 02:06:12.564
NEED TO GO THROUGH THAT

02:06:12.631 --> 02:06:13.699
ENFORCEMENT ASPECT. THAT

02:06:13.766 --> 02:06:15.234
POTENTIALLY MAY NOT BE A

02:06:15.301 --> 02:06:17.403
COMFORTABLE PLACE FIRST TO HIM

02:06:17.469 --> 02:06:19.505
FOR AN EMPLOYEE TO ENFORCE

02:06:19.571 --> 02:06:20.873
AGAINST THEIR EMPLOYER. WHO SAY

02:06:20.940 --> 02:06:23.809
THAT CHECKS OUT NOW. THE CARD

02:06:23.876 --> 02:06:25.377

02:06:25.444 --> 02:06:26.312
LAST YEAR DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE

02:06:26.378 --> 02:06:30.849
REQUEST WAS- HURT- DOLLAR WISE

02:06:30.916 --> 02:06:32.051
AND HOW MUCH WAS REIMBURSED. SO

02:06:32.117 --> 02:06:35.988
IS IT BEEN TEN YEARS I THINK WAS

02:06:36.055 --> 02:06:37.022
AN OUTLOOK OUT HERE. BUT WE- WE

02:07:29.408 --> 02:07:30.809
THAT'S THE CRITICAL PART ABOUT

02:07:30.876 --> 02:07:32.878
THIS. CORRECT OKAY ABSOLUTE.

02:07:32.945 --> 02:07:35.948
WELL SO I THINK THE ONLY-

02:07:36.015 --> 02:07:38.017
ADDITIONAL COMMENT I WOULD MAKE

02:07:38.083 --> 02:07:41.086
IS THAT I THINK IT'S- IMPORTANT

02:07:41.153 --> 02:07:43.856
THAT- WHAT YOU'RE DOING ISN'T

02:07:43.922 --> 02:07:45.124
DUPLICATING WHAT'S ALREADY

02:07:45.190 --> 02:07:47.359
HAPPENING IT IS MORE IN THE

02:07:47.426 --> 02:07:49.461
NATURE OF OVERSEEING WHAT'S

02:07:49.528 --> 02:07:51.363
HAPPENING ON THE- ON THE

02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:54.566
CAMPUSES UNDERSTANDING. THAT

02:07:54.633 --> 02:07:55.534
THERE'S PROBABLY SOME

02:07:55.601 --> 02:07:56.969
SIGNIFICANT GRAY AREA THERE

02:07:57.036 --> 02:07:59.271
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING IN THE

02:07:59.338 --> 02:08:00.672
EXAMPLE THAT YOU GAVE OF THE

02:08:00.739 --> 02:08:03.409
CHIMNEY. THING THAT YOU'RE

02:08:03.475 --> 02:08:07.046
TALKING ABOUT- THAT'S GOING TO

02:08:07.112 --> 02:08:09.481
BE INSPECTED PRESUMABLY BY THE

02:08:09.548 --> 02:08:11.850
ON CAMPUS FIRE MARSHAL AND THEN

02:08:11.917 --> 02:08:14.486
IT MAY BE. YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE

02:08:14.553 --> 02:08:16.055
A HUNDRED THINGS LIKE THAT THAT

02:08:16.121 --> 02:08:18.057
AND THE OVERSIGHT IS ONLY GOING

02:08:18.123 --> 02:08:20.292
TO PROBABLY LOOK AT A SUBSET OF

02:08:20.359 --> 02:08:22.161
THOSE THINGS BUT IT MIGHT CROSS

02:08:22.227 --> 02:08:23.996
OVER SO MIGHT GET A DOUBLE

02:08:24.063 --> 02:08:28.100
CHECK. BUT. I DON'T THINK WE

02:08:28.167 --> 02:08:30.602
NEED AND MAYBE YOU CAN TELL ME

02:08:30.669 --> 02:08:32.337
IF I'M RIGHT OR WRONG ON THIS I

02:08:32.404 --> 02:08:34.807
DON'T THINK THAT WE NEED- TWO

02:08:34.873 --> 02:08:37.209
IDENTICAL LAYERS OF FIRE

02:08:37.276 --> 02:08:40.512
MARSHALS- AT EAST EAST CAMPUS

02:08:40.579 --> 02:08:44.483
THE THING THAT- IT'S BEEN

02:08:44.550 --> 02:08:47.052
DETERMINED TO BE MISSING. IS

02:08:47.119 --> 02:08:50.022
THE- CONSISTENT OVERSIGHT ROLE

02:08:50.089 --> 02:08:52.224
OF THE- STATE FARM MARSHAL'S

02:08:52.291 --> 02:08:55.461
OFFICE CORRECT SO IF. IF WE

02:08:55.527 --> 02:08:57.663
WANTED TO BE DUPLICATIVE THERE

02:08:57.729 --> 02:08:59.631
WOULD BE WAY MORE THAN TWELVE.

02:08:59.698 --> 02:09:02.534
POSITIONS ASKED IN THIS- SAYS

02:09:02.601 --> 02:09:04.837
LIKE THEY'RE DOING IT WITH EIGHT

02:09:04.903 --> 02:09:06.872
. WELL THAT'S JUST FOR THE THREE

02:09:06.939 --> 02:09:08.340
CAMPUSES THEY'RE DOING IT WITH A

02:09:08.407 --> 02:09:10.542
TOTAL OF TWENTY EIGHT STATEWIDE

02:09:10.609 --> 02:09:12.978
OKAY OKAY I MISSED THAT. WHO IS

02:09:13.045 --> 02:09:16.115
THAT THAT. THAT THAT BRINGS ME A

02:09:16.181 --> 02:09:17.516
LOT MORE COMFORT BECAUSE I

02:09:17.583 --> 02:09:18.150
THOUGHT THAT THERE IT SOUNDED

02:09:18.217 --> 02:09:20.119
LIKE- WHAT I WAS HEARING WAS

02:09:20.185 --> 02:09:21.453
THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY A

02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:25.991
SHORTFALL OF- INDIVIDUALS- OKAY

02:09:26.058 --> 02:09:29.161
. SO I THINK THAT PROBABLY-

02:09:29.228 --> 02:09:30.896
BRINGS US TO CLOSE ON THIS ITEM

02:09:30.963 --> 02:09:35.400

RECYCLING SOUNDS PROMISING BUT I

02:11:23.942 --> 02:11:26.178

THAT'S NOT SHOWN- STRUCK SHOWN-

02:11:33.252 --> 02:11:34.753

HAVE ANOTHER YEAR OF DROUGHT.

02:12:46.525 --> 02:12:47.592
THAT COULD GET EVEN WORSE AND SO

02:12:47.659 --> 02:12:49.528
