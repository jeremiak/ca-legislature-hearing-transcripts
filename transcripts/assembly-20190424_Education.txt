TO GIVE MY ADVISER NINE A WEEK. THIS IS FILE ITEM TEN ASSEMBLY BILL AND NINE ZERO EIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS. AB NINE AWAY WILL PROVIDE TEACHERS WITH THE BANK OF RELEASED TAX TAXED ITEMS FROM THE STATE'S ANNUAL ASSESSMENT FOR USE. AS A FORMATION ASSESSMENT TOOL. FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT IS A POWERFUL PRACTICE TEACHERS USE. TO CHECK HOW OTHER STUDENTS ARE LEARNING AND HE USED AND THE USE RESULTS TO IMPROVE THEIR INSTRUCTION. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES A STATE RIGHT SCHOOLS WITH FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT TOOLS. THE STATE MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS REQUIREMENT BY PROVIDING TEACHERS WITH ACCESS TO A DIGITAL LIBRARY OF LESSONS IN WHICH FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT IS EMBEDDED. IN THEORY. BUT THERE ARE SOME LIMITATIONS TO THIS APPROACH TEACHERS MAY NOT TO SHOOT CHOOSE TO USE THESE LESSONS THE FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT RESOURCES IN THE DIGITAL LIBRARY CAN BE INCONSISTENT AND FORMAT AND QUALITY. I CAN WILL ATTEST TO THAT. IN THE FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT RESOURCES DO NOT NECESSARILY ALIGN WITH THE WAY PROFICIENCY IS ASSESSED. ON THE SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT. AGAIN SOME MOTIVE IS AT THE END OF THE YEAR FORMATIVE IS IS IS IS THE ENTER. IT CAN HAPPEN DALY CHEN AFFECTION HAVE THAT HAPPEN DALY DOESN'T NECESSARILY A CHEST BUT AS A CHECK IN TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT STUDENTS ARE MASTERING. THE OTHER CONTENT YOU'RE TRYING TO CONVEY TO THEM. CALIFORNIA TEACHERS CURRENTLY HAVE ACCESS TO SOME SAMPLE TEST ITEMS BUT THEY'RE LIMITED IN NUMBER NOT ORGANIZED BY STANDARD AND CONTAINED FEW PERFORMANCE TASK IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE THAT WE'RE WE ARE WHERE WE ARE -- WITH WITH THE US BACK TODAY THE SHOULD BE. A REGULAR PART OF THE TEACHER SHOULD HAVE READ -- READILY AVAILABLE ACCESS TO TO THESE KINDS OF OF PERFORMANCE TASK AND AS AN S. ASSESSMENTS FORMATIVE ASSESSMENTS. OTHER STATES AS WELL AS OTHER NATIONAL ASSESSMENT CONSORTIUM PROVIDES EXTENSIVE COLLECTIONS OF RELEASED TEST ITEMS. AS WELL AS SCORING GUIDES AND SAMPLES OF STUDENT WORK. TEACHERS IN THESE STATES CAN USE THESE RESOURCES AS FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT TOOLS. CALIFORNIA TEACHERS SHOULD HAVE THE SAME KIND OF RESOURCES. AB NINE OH ABLE GIVE TEACHERS A POWERFUL TOOL TO USE AND FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT. WHICH WILL ENABLE THEM TO IMPROVE THEIR TEACHING. TO HELP THEIR STUDENTS MASTER EDUCATIONAL PROFICIENCY. BUT WITH ME -- IN SUPPORT TODAY IS. BILL LUCY A MAYBE. BUT I I I IT MUST MEMBER MISTER LUCY WERE HERE HE WOULD SAY THIS IS A FINAL BILL THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR.

GREAT A GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS AND MUCH THOUGHT OR SOME HAVE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS -- OR ACCESS AND SUPPORT WE BELIEVE IN AB NINE AWAIT IS A GOOD MEASURE VERY GOOD MEASURE BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE A TOOL IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR TEACHERS ARE FREE. OF CHARGE THEIR OPTIONAL TOOLS THAT CAN HELP INFORM INSTRUCTION WE BELIEVE THE MORE TOWARD THE TEACHERS HAVE TO ADD TO IT FROM WHAT THEY DO EVERY DAY IN THE CLASSROOM IS BETTER FOR KIDS -- THE FACT THAT AND THEY ARE AVAILABLE ON A FOR FREE OF CHARGE I'M MEANS THEY CAN USE A MUST PARA PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. IT ON THAT SCHOOL PRINCIPALS CAN HELP SUPPORT TEACHERS -- AND THEREFORE WE SUPPLY REQUEST OR UNSUPPORTED ON EIGHTY NINE AWAIT. ERICA HOFFMAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION VERY MUCH SUPPORT IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE.

FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND THANK MANY STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THE BILL. AB FIVE SEVEN EIGHT ESTABLISHES THE CALIFORNIA STEM TEACHING PATHWAY ACTIVE. TWENTY NINETEEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECRUITING PREPARING SUPPORTING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED STEM PROFESSIONALS AS MATHEMATICS SCIENCE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE TEACHERS IN CALIFORNIA. AN APPROPRIATE TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THAT PURPOSE. CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC STRENGTH IS ROOTED IN STEM PROFESSIONS UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA SHORTAGE OF QUALIFIED MATH AND SCIENCE TEACHERS THREATENS THE FUTURE WORK FORCE AND ECONOMIC WELL BEING OF THE STATE. WITH A PROJECTED SHORTAGE OF MORE THAN THIRTY THREE THOUSAND MATH AND SCIENCE TEACHERS. CURRENT RECRUITMENT AND PREPARATION APPROACHES ARE NOT SUFFICIENT. IF WE DO NOT INCREASE THE PIPELINE OF TEACHERS QUALIFIED TO TEACH THEM CLASSES WE WILL NOT MEET THE DEMAND FOR JOBS IN THE SECTORS. THAT ARE CONTINUOUSLY EXPERIENCING GROWTH CREATING PATHWAYS FOR PROFESSIONALS VETERANS AND CURRENT TEACHERS TO BECOME STEM TEACHERS WILL BILL THAT PIPELINE. THIS GRANT PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE FUNDING TO PROMOTE THE TRANSITION OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING AND MATH INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS AND RETIREES INTO THE TEACHING PROFESSION. WITH ME TODAY IT'S A SPONSOR OF THE BILL. MY GOOD FRIEND STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND AND OUR CHIEF SUPPORTER HERE TO TESTIFY [inaudible] YES SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SEVEN MEMO IF YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE -- HERE JUST TO ADD OUR SUPPORT FOR AB -- FIVE SEVENTY EIGHT WE WOULD CONCUR WITH WHAT YOU HEARD AND AND NOT REPEATED ONLY TO ADD EMPHASIS THAT -- IF THERE WILL BE A MILLION AND A HALF JOBS AND TECHNOLOGY TO FEW YEARS AND PROBABLY HALF OF THE APPLICANTS FOR THOSE JOBS UNLESS WE CHANGE THE WAY WE PREPARE OUR STUDENTS. FOR THE JOBS OF TOMORROW THAT MEANS THAT THEY'VE GOT TO HAVE ACCESS TO MORE COMPUTER SCIENCE AND MORE MATH AND SCIENCE THAT MEANS WE NEED EDUCATORS WHO CAN PROVIDE THAT. THIS BILL CREATES A PATHWAY FOR SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO BECOME A TEACHER ONE OF THOSE FEELS OR WHO IS A TEACHER WHO WANTS TO MOVE INTO THAT AREA. THIS BILL ENVISIONS WAYS DO RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. FOR EIGHTY FIVE SEVENTY EIGHT OTHERS IN OTHER SOMEBODY WENT OUT MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M VINCE STEWART WITH CHILDREN NOW I'M ALSO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STEM NETWORK. WHICH IS A STATEWIDE PARTNERSHIP OF K. TWELVE HIGHER DUCATION -- BUSINESS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ADVANCING STEM EDUCATION. MORE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB FIVE SEVENTY EIGHT WE THINK IT'LL MAKE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN TERMS OF RECRUITING AND RETAINING STEM TEACHERS. I THINK IT'S WELL DOCUMENTED THE SWORDS IN THE STATE OF THESE TEACHERS PARTICULARLY IN THE SUBJECTS AND IN SMALL IN RURAL DISTRICTS -- ENROLLMENT CENTER TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS HAVE GROWN BUT NOT GROWING FAST ENOUGH AND WE KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE TEACHERS THAT WE ARE GOING TO NEED OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS -- WE BE CURRENTLY THAT -- THAT SHORTAGE IS BEING FILLED BY TEACHERS WHO ARE LESS THAN QUALIFIED -- IN THOSE TEACHERS ARE TEACHING IN SCHOOLS THAT ARE PREDOMINANTLY LOW INCOME AND MINORITY STUDENTS. SO WE FEEL THAT THIS WILL GO A LONG WAY TO ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE -- RECRUITMENT OR SHOULD SAY RETENTION IS A BIG ISSUE AS WELL AND IN OAKLAND UNIFIED WERE MY DAUGHTER IS A STUDENT -- THEY LOSE ABOUT A THIRD OF THEIR TEACHERS NEW TEACHERS EVERY THREE YEARS SO I THINK AB FIVE SEVENTY EIGHT WILL GO A LONG WAY TO BRING NEW PEOPLE INTO THE PROFESSION.

AB FOR FIFTY TWO WHICH I'M ALL THROUGH WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY MEMBER THIS COMMITTEE. SEEKS TO CONVERT THE CALIFORNIA CHILD CARE FACILITIES REVOLVING FUNDS INTO THE CALIFORNIA CHILD CARE FACILITIES GRANT FIND. REPORTS OF THE LEGISLATURE OVER THE LAST DECADE REFLECT THAT THE FUND HAS BEEN SEVERELY UNDER UTILIZED. DURING THE TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN FISCAL YEAR THE REVOLVING FUND DID NOT RECEIVE A SINGLE APPLICATION. RECOMMENDATIONS TO OVERHAUL THE FUNDING CONVERTED TO A GRAND FUND OF COME FROM BRIEFS BY THE ADVANCEMENT PROJECT AND A DRAFT OF THE SPEAKERS BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. I HAVE WITH ME TODAY CHRISTOPHER MARKEL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF HEAD START CALIFORNIA AND ANGIE GARLING NATIONAL EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION DIRECTOR FOR THE LOW INCOME INVESTMENT. FUND AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ABOUT. YOU YOUR FIRST WITNESS. A GOOD AFTERNOON CHRIS FOR MIRACLE -- FOR HISTORY CALIFORNIA -- REPRESENTING THE HUNDRED FIFTY GRANTEES AGENCIES THAT SERVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN -- IF CALIFORNIA'S MOST AT RISK CHILDREN ZERO TO FIVE WE'RE GRATEFUL -- TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN AFTER BRINGING FORTH THIS BILL -- THE SERVICE GAP FOR INFANTS AND TODDLERS A SHOOTING THREE IS WELL DOCUMENTED AS WELL AS THE LACK OF FACILITIES -- THIS LEGISLATION DOES TO GREAT THINGS. IT MAKES MORE FUNDING AVAILABLE. FOR FACILITIES DEVELOPED TO SERVE THOSE CHILDREN. AND IT MAKES THE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO MORE INCLUSIVE RANGE OF PROVIDERS AND THAT IS ESSENTIAL BECAUSE ARE MIXED DELIVERY SYSTEM INCLUDES DIFFERENT KINDS OF AGENCIES WHO OFFER BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDED PROGRAMS -- WE BELIEVE THE INCLUSIVITY WILL HELP INCENTIVIZE PROVIDERS TO CREATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR CARE FOR OUR YOUNGEST CITIZENS AND HEAD START CALIFORNIA IS IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU OUR NEXT WITNESS GREAT THANK YOU ANGIE GARLING WITH THE LOW INCOME INVESTMENT FUND TO ADDRESS -- WHY THE AMENDMENTS INCLUDED THE OPTION FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO CONTRACT WITH ONE OR MORE CDF EYES? SO THE LOW INCOME INVESTMENT FUND IS A C. DFI THAT IS A COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION -- LIST AS ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE COUNTRY AND BASICALLY WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT WE'RE A NONPROFIT BANK. WERE MISSION DRIVEN AND WE WORK -- ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES TO DEVELOP CHILD CARE HOUSING -- FOOD IS A FACILITIES THINGS THAT WILL HELP ADDRESS THE NEEDS IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES -- IN TERMS OF CHILDCARE WE HAVE NATIONALLY INVESTED -- A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND TO PRESERVE THEIR EXPANDED TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND SPACES SO THE ADVANTAGES FOR USING A C. DFI ARE REALLY TO THE FIRST IS THAT IT LEVERAGES ADDITIONAL FUNDING. SO YOU CAN. FOR EVERY DOLLAR INVESTED IN TO THE MAIN MARKETS WE WORK IN RIGHT NOW SAN FRANCISCO AND WASHINGTON DC. YOU GET THREE DOLLARS IN -- FUNDING SO IF THE IF THERE'S FUNDING INVESTED THEN WE WILL WE HAVE CDF EYES SPECIALIZE IN BEING ABLE TO FINANCE AND HELP PACKAGE ADDITIONAL FUNDING PROJECTS THROUGH LOANS AND GRANTS WE HAVE EXPERIENCE IN WORKING WITH -- AND CDF EYES HAVE EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH CENTERS AS WELL AS FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WITH LOANS GRANTS AND THE SECOND REASON THAT CDF EYES ARE IMPORTANT IN THE MIX IS THROUGH THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT THEY PROVIDE. THEY PROVIDE WE PROVIDE ROBUST TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON THE AT THE BEGINNING SO WE MAKE SURE THAT NO PROJECTS GO FORWARD UNLESS THERE SHOVEL READY AND HAVE SOUND FINANCING -- AND THEN TA ON THE OTHER END TO ENSURE THAT THE INVESTMENT IS IS SOUND SO WITH FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WE WILL FOLLOW A FIVE THOUSAND OR TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR -- GRANT OR LOAN FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS UP TO THIRTY YEARS FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS -- INVESTMENT SO WE WE ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC INVESTMENT -- IS IS SOUNDS AND IS -- MADE. MADE TO INSURE THAT THE CHILDREN -- BENEFIT ON AN ONGOING BASIS THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. AARON GAVE ON THE HAVE A FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT.

SOON OPPOSITION WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS READY THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SIX MR MCCARTY. YES -- I AM A A A JOINT AUTHORED HERE SO IT'S KIND OF AWKWARD I'M ASKING A TOUGH QUESTION ABOUT A BILL THAT MY NAME IS ON BUT ONE THING THAT -- I KNOW WE TALKED TO YOU ABOUT OUR OTHER MISTER CHAIR AND A COMMITTEE STAFF ABOUT THERE ARE OTHER -- BOND PROPOSAL AND FACILITIES IS. WITH THE LA ETS AND THAT THE NON ELEAZAR AND CERTAINLY IT'S A MIXED DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR ALL EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS INVENT TOLAR PROGRAMS DON'T TALK A PROGRAMS AND PRE K.. AND SO WITH PUBLIC MONEY WITH NON GOVERNMENT ENTITIES ITS IT'S YOU KNOW WE MAKE SURE THAT WE FOCUS ON PROTECTING OUR TAXPAYER INTEREST SO WITH THE CONSTRUCTION THING JUST ONE THING I KNOW THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT GOING FORWARD. IS IF THERE IS IT AT WHOLESALE NEW CONSTRUCTION AND THE NEW. PROGRAM WITH THE GRANT AND NOT ALONE IS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE PROTECT THAT THE THE PUBLIC INTERESTED IN OTHER WORDS. IS THERE LIKE A IS THERE LIKE A CO SIGNER LACK OF BETTER WORD THAT SAID. PARK DISTRICT IS A SCHOOL DISTRICT OR SOMETHING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. GETTING THE MOST OUT OF OUR PUBLIC DOLLAR. I WILL ALLOW MY EXPERTS A SHOT AT THAT BUT I JUST WANTED TO REITERATE THAT WE HAVE -- BACK THE ELIGIBLE ENTITIES THAT CAN RECEIVE THE FUNDS. TO THOSE THAT HAVE A HISTORY OF PROVIDING CHILDCARE WHERE THERE'S LITTLE RISK OF LOSING ALL PUBLIC FUNDS TO PRIVATE ENTITIES THERE HAVE BEEN SOME ISSUES IN THE PAST IN THAT REGARD I KNOW THERE'S A CONCERN THERE. BUT ALL ALLOW -- ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENT ON THE NO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT -- CDF I THINK A LOT ABOUT ENDS UP FIRST OF ALL WE PROVIDE STRONG TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SO APPROACH A PROJECT WILL BE READY UNLESS WE KNOW IT HAS SOUND FINANCING. AND THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WE PROVIDE TO MITIGATE RISK ON THE OTHER END IS -- EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO THE C. DFI AND THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS AS WELL TO PROVIDE MITIGATION OF RESPITE TENSELY PARTNERING WITH -- FILL IN PHILANTHROPY TO PUT UP EQUITY THERE'S OTHER -- CREATIVE WAYS THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT -- THERE'S NO GIFT A PUBLIC FUND THE OTHER THING THAT I'LL SAY IS THAT IT IS VERY VERY UNLIKELY IN ALL THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE WITH A LOW INCOME INVESTMENT FUND. TO HAVE ANY KIND OF DEFAULTS WE WE WORK REALLY CLOSELY TO ENSURE THAT THROUGH THE LOAN OR GRANT PROCESS. THE PROVIDER COMES UP MUCH STRONGER FROM A BUSINESS AND ON THE OTHER SIDE. WELL I GUESS Là THEY GIVE A HYPOTHETICAL AND GRANT IS TO BE NUKES HAVE BEEN GIVING LOANS OUT THEY WEREN'T AS ATTRACTIVE NOW THE A GRANT. AND THAT THE OTHER THING IS IF HAVING PROPER REIMBURSEMENT FOR THESE PROGRAMS WHICH FOR HAVE ANOTHER IDEA FOR THAT. LATER ON BUT WHAT IF THERE IS YOU KNOW A NEW OPERATOR. NO MULLINS EARLY LEARNING PROGRAM IN SOUTH SAN MATTEO HE'S GOING AT IT AND WANTS TO BUILD A FACILITY IN IN THE NOTHING WRONG WITH A FINANCES ONE DAY LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT. THIS IS NOT MY THING WHEN I MOVE ON TO DO. YOU KNOW THE A LIFE COACH. GIVE ME A CAREER IDEAS MISTER MOM AND DAD AND TO HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THAT THAT ASSET REMAINS WHAT IT WAS -- DESTINED FOR JUST SOME PROTECTION SO OBVIOUSLY I'M PART OF THIS SO WANT TO MAKE JUST OUT THE RECORD THIS ISSUE HAS COME UP AND OTHER CONVERSATIONS I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. STRONG PROTECTIONS THERE. LET ME JUST SAY I AM LOOKING FOR A POST LEGISLATIVE CAREER SO I MAY TAKE YOU UP ON THAT -- SUGGESTION BY -- AND AS A JOINT AUTHOR I LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT WE HAVE INCLUDED SOME CLAWBACK PROVISIONS. OUGHT TO ENSURE THAT. THE ENTITIES RECEIVING THE FUNDS CONTINUE TO OPERATE AS CHILD CARE CENTER. FOR A SPECIFIED AMOUNT OF TIME SO I'M VERY SENSITIVE ON THE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE RAISING. AND IF WE NEED ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE TO FURTHER CLARIFY THAT -- OF CERTAINLY MORE THAN HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN THAT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU MISTER MCCARTY THE BUDGET PROCESS WHERE WE CAN ENSURE THAT SOME OF THOSE GUARD RAILS ARE IN PLACE -- WHEN WE WHEN WE ACTUALLY PUT DOLLARS INTO THIS NEWLY CREATED FIND? AND I BELIEVE A WITH EMBEDDED IN THE BILL AS A TEN YEAR COMMITMENT. YES FROM TIME TO RECEIVE THE MONEY. YES TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS READY COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

FIFTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT HIGHLAND MI [inaudible] SIX ME [inaudible] OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING ALL OF THE COMMITTEES CLEAR FINE AMENDMENTS AND WOULD LIKE TO THANK STAFF FOR THEIR EFFORTS TO BUILD UPON THE EXISTING -- PROPOSAL. I'M AB FIFTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT ESTABLISHES A SCHOOL PAVEMENT TO PARKS GRANT PROGRAM ADMINISTERED UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO PROVIDE APPLYING SCHOOL DISTRICTS FUNDING FOR CONVERTING PORTIONS OF EXISTING PAVEMENT. ON SCHOOL GROUNDS TO LIVE IN SCHOOL YARDS AND GARDENS. PARTICIPATING SCHOOLS WE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM THAT INCORPORATE INCORPORATES SCIENCE MATH LITERACY IN NUTRITION FOR THEIR STUDENTS. OUR SCHOOLS WILL BE REQUIRED TO PARTNER WITH NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO MATCH STATE GRANT MONEY. PRIORITY WILL BE GIVEN TO SCHOOLS WITH POOR AIR QUALITY AND HIGH AMOUNTS OF STUDENTS ON FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH. THE ANALYSIS QUESTIONS. WHY WE CALL THIS BILL PAVEMENT TO PARKS THE QUICK ANSWER IS AT A DISTRICT SCHOOL THAT I VISITED IN LOS ANGELES? OF THE KIDS ASTOR TEACHER IF THEY COULD GO TO THE PARK WHICH WAS ACTUALLY ON THEIR SCHOOL GARDEN BOXES AND FOR MANY OF THESE KIDS THIS IS THE ONLY ACCESS THEY HAVE TO GREEN SPACE SINCE THEY LIVE. IN APARTMENT BUILDINGS AND UNFORTUNATELY DON'T HAVE ACCESS -- TO PARKS NEAR NEARBY. I'M YOU KNOW IN THE MINDS OF THESE KIDS THEY WERE THIS IS WHERE THEY GO TO THE PARK EVERY DAY AND THEY SPEND MOST OF THEIR DAY AT SCHOOL -- AND SO THIS IS THE ACCESS THAT THEY HAVE OF POOR AIR QUALITY IMPACTS NUMEROUS COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I'M IN LOS ANGELES ALONE THERE ARE -- WHAT? OVER ONE POINT SIX MILLION LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO HEALTH ISSUES DUE TO POOR AIR QUALITY. ACCORDING TO A RECENT STUDY BY THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES. AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINO MINORITIES BERIT DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN FROM THE AIR POLLUTION BECAUSE MAINLY BY NON HISPANIC WHITES. THIS RECENTLY PUBLISHED RESEARCH QUALIFIES FOR THE FIRST TIME THE RACIAL GAP BETWEEN WHO CAUSES AIR POLLUTION IN WHO BREED SAID. THE DATA INDICATE THAT EVEN THOUGH MINORITIES ARE CONTINUE CONTRIBUTING LESS TO THE OVERALL ISSUE OF AIR POLLUTION THERE AFFECTED BY IT MORE. THE CITY PROJECT ALSO COMPLETED A STUDY WHICH HIGHLIGHTS THE CHILDREN OF COLOR. ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY LIVING COMMUNITIES OF CONCENTRATED POVERTY WITHOUT ENOUGH PLACES TO PLAY AND PARKS AND SCHOOLS AND WITHOUT ACCESS TO CARS -- AN ADEQUATE TRANSIT SYSTEM TO REACH QUALITY PARKS AND SCHOOL FIELDS ANOTHER NEIGHBORHOODS. ON A NATIONWIDE BASIS LAST YEAR OF AFRICAN AMERICAN CAN CHILDREN AND URBAN AREAS WERE KEPT INSIDE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THERE NEIGHBORHOODS. WERE PERCEIVED AS DANGEROUS COMPARED 225% OF NON HISPANIC WHITE CHILDREN. UP FINALLY ACCORDING TO A RECENT PRESS RELEASE ISSUED BY THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AS PART OF THEIR STRIKE NEGOTIATIONS. WITH THE TEACHERS UNION THE DISTRICT WILL BE ESTABLISHING A JOINT GREEN SPACE TASK FORCE CHARGED WITH PRESENTING A PLAN TO INCREASE GREENSPACE AND COMMUNITY SCHOOL PARKS BY DECEMBER -- TWENTY NINETEEN EXPERTS TEACHERS AND PARENTS ALL UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF PROVIDING CHILDREN WITH ACCESS TO PARKS AND GREEN SPACES. OF THE THIS PAYMENTS TO PARKS PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL FITNESS SUPPORT CREATIVITY REDUCE VIOLENCE CYMBELINE REDUCE STRESS INSPIRE CRITICAL THINKING AND PROBLEM SOLVING. AND INCREASE COMPETENCY AND SCIENCE LANGUAGE AND LITERACY. I HAVE ME TODAY -- RICO MUST AN AUTO WITH THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LANDS AND ALSO READ A DIS TO PROVIDE A BRIEF TESTIMONY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS RECALL MONSTER TO NOT -- WITH THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND -- REALLY WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR FOR PRESENTING THIS BILL THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND HAS BEEN CONVERTING SCHOOLYARDS. IN THE UNITED STATES FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS AND IT'S AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IDEA AND ADVANCE THIS IN CALIFORNIA FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS WE ARE PARK POOR. WE HAVE OVER ALMOST TWO MILLION KIDS IN LOS ANGELES ALONE THAT ARE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A PARK. THE SAME COULD BE SAID ABOUT ANAHEIM BAKERSFIELD FRESNO THE LIST GOES ON AND ON IF YOU'RE PARK POOR YOU'RE ALSO NOT READY FOR THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THAT MEANS NO TREE CANOPY THAT MEANS SUSCEPTIBILITY TO FLOAT SEVERE FLOODING IN THE IMPACTS OF THAT BECAUSE OF LACK OF PERMEABLE PAVING. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- MENTIONED OR NOTED THAT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF KIDS AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THIS IS THEIR ONLY OPPORTUNITY TO BE OUTSIDE. THEIR OWN NEIGHBORHOOD IS EITHER AND ACCESSIBLE BECAUSE THEY'RE IN APARTMENTS OR IT'S TOO DANGEROUS FRANKLY TO BE OUTSIDE. AND IF YOU CAN'T GO OUTSIDE BECAUSE IT'S TOO HOT BECAUSE THERE'S NO WHERE TO PLAY OR A BECAUSE THERE'S NO SHADE -- IT REALLY LEADS -- TO INESCAPABLE SITUATION FOR KIDS NOT TO HAVE ANY RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES WHATSOEVER WE'VE CONVERTED OVER TWO HUNDRED PLAYGROUNDS IN NEW YORK CITY -- SINCE NINETEEN NINETY IT'S RESULTED IN FOUR POINT ONE MILLION PEOPLE HAVING MORE ACCESS TO PARKS YOU CAN DO THIS THROUGH SCHOOL YARDS YOU CAN HAVE JOINT USE AGREEMENTS -- SO THAT THE SCHOOL YARDS ARE AVAILABLE AFTER SCHOOL AND ON WEEKENDS TO THE PUBLIC ALL OF THIS CAN BE DONE. AND THIS IS OF INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IDEA I REALLY WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR ANNA URGENTLY VOTE. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS READ BEHALF OF THE LA NEIGHBORHOOD LAND TRUST HERE IN SUPPORT TODAY. VERY IMPORTANT TO DEAL WE HAVE -- BASIC LACK OF GREEN SPACE PARKS AND GARDENS IN OUR COMMUNITIES THE ONLY NEIGHBORHOOD LAND TRUST IS A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION WE OPERATE OUT OF LA COUNTY. AND DAY IN AND DAY OUT WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH THIS ISSUE. EVEN WHEN YOU PUT -- AS THE STATE HAS DONE PROP SIXTY EIGHT POINTS IN PUBLIC RESOURCES ON THE TABLE. OR AS IN LA COUNTY MEASURE A RECENTLY PASSED AND LOCAL -- DOLLARS ON THE TABLE IT'S NOT ALWAYS ABOUT THE MONEY. IT'S ABOUT TRYING TO FIND SPACES THAT ARE EITHER AFFORDABLE OR EVEN AVAILABLE AT ALL. AND SO WHAT WE SEE IN A BILL LIKE THIS IS IT ALLOWS US TO ACCESS NEW RESOURCES IN THIS CASE. ASPHALT SPACES AT SCHOOLS. WHICH SERVE THAT FUNCTION OF PROVIDING OPEN SPACE GREEN SPACE GARDENS OR A SMALL POCKET PARK. SO IT'S CRITICAL THAT A MEASURE LIKE THIS MOVE FORWARD IT HELPS THE COMMUNITIES NOT JUST IN LA I'M SURE WITH YOU ALL GO BACK TO YOUR DISTRICT YOU HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM WHEN YOU GO BACK. THE PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING. TO TAKE THE FUNDING THAT THEY CAN GET FROM THE STATE THEN GO FIND HOW TO USE THAT FUNDING HOW TO FIND SPACES TO BUY TO ACQUIRE IN BILL PARKS. A BILL LIKE THIS ALLOWS US TO CLOSE THAT GAP ALLOWS A STAKE IN A FIGHT -- SPACES -- WE'RE WE CAN PROVIDE THAT -- TYPE OF PARK FOR THE TYPE TO COMMUNITIES WERE LOOKING AT LA NEIGHBORHOOD LANCHESTER REALLY DOES TRY TO FOCUS ON THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES -- THAT ARE DESPERATELY TRYING TO GET ACCESS TO THESE FACILITIES THERE'S TWO NUMBERS ARE CLOSER TO NUMBERS. THAT I WANT TO SHARE. THE STANDARD IS TO BE ABLE TO GO ACCESS A PARK OR GREEN SPACE WITHIN A TEN MINUTE WALK FROM YOUR HOME. IN LA COUNTY ALONE ONLY ABOUT ABLE TO DO THAT SO WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO THIS MEASURE REALLY HELPS US THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. AARON TAYLOR ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT. MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS AND SUPPORT. KEVIN FROM OF THE COMP UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF BLACK SCHOOL EDUCATORS AND SUPPORT. AARON RODRIGUEZ WITH UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU -- ANY ANY. OPPOSITION. SINGLE OPPOSITION ANY COMMENTS FROM ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER CARTY YES THAT THANK YOU I I THINK THIS IS DESPERATELY NEEDED DIED I PROBABLY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF THIS IN MY DISTRICT BUT I KNOW. THE DENSITY YOU HAVE IN YOUR DISTRICT IN THE VALLEY PARKWAY MEN RIGHT FAMILY IN SANTA ANA I SEE THIS FIRST HAND WITH THESE. COMMUNITIES WITH SO MANY MULTI FAMILY APARTMENTS AND THERE'S NO PLACE TO GO WHETHER THE YEAR ON YOUR SCHOOL DAY OR ON WEEKENDS AND EVENINGS AND HOLIDAYS. THIS IS NEEDED OBVIOUSLY AT THE SCHOOL SITES BUT I THINK BIGGER THAN THAT LIKE. YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR WITNESS -- IN THESE -- PARK DEFICIENT NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE A PARK ALL OF THE GREEN SPACE BUT THERE'S A SCHOOL. AND SOMETIMES LOCKED UP I KNOW THAT'S FOR SECURITY REASONS AND SAFETY WANT TO PROTECT OUR ASSET AND ALL THAT BUT THE SAME TIME. WE'RE DEALING WITH OTHER ISSUES AS WELL SO I THINK WE NEED TO TO STEP IT UP AND AND JUST -- ONE OBSERVATION IS THAT WE DO HAVE OUR PARK BONDS EVERY EVERY EVERY FEW YEARS AND SO I THINK THIS TO BE AN EXCELLENT. PROGRAM TO BE INCLUDED AS WELL I KNOW YOU'RE IN THE END COMMITTEE TRYING TO CREATE THIS PROGRAM. BUT HAVE THE CONCLUSION OF THIS IN THE NEXT PARK BOND THAT GOES ON THE BALLOT IS PROBABLY. A GOOD PATH AS WELL SO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I MISS SMITH. THANK YOU MEMORY OF US FOR THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE I'M I'M COMPLETELY INCLINED TO SUPPORT IT TODAY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT MEAN WE'VE I'M SURE YOU KNOW THE TIE INS PARTICULARLY WHEN KIDS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO PLANT SOMETHING AND SEE IF GROWING THAT TIES IN SO BEAUTIFULLY WITH THE NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS MY BIGGEST CONCERN NOW. IS THAT WE ARE ALLOWING SCHOOLS AS OPPORTUNITY WITH WHAT ARE ONE TIME DOLLARS AND I I KNOW THAT WE GOT TO THIS PLACE IN YOUR DISTRICT DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE. BECAUSE IT CONSISTENTLY AGAIN WE NEED TO KEEP REMINDING OUR PUBLIC OF THIS WE RANK IN PER PUPIL SPENDING IN CALIFORNIA IN THE BOTTOM. TEN PERSISTENTLY AND SO SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SCHOOL BOARDS HAVE MADE THE CHOICE TO REMOVE GREEN SPACE FROM THEIR CAMPUSES BASED ON THE ONGOING MAINTENANCE COSTS SIMPLY OF HAVING THOSE SPACES WITH THE IRRIGATION AND WITH MAINTENANCE CREWS. REQUIRED FOR OUR CHILDREN TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT KIND OF SPACE TO ENJOY SO WHILE I ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THIS AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE MOVE IT FORWARD WE GOT TO START TO INCLUDE THIS NOW IN OUR BIGGER CONVERSATION OF OUR SCHOOLS BEING UNDER FUNDED ACROSS THE STATE. THE POINT THANK YOU I SEE NO OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE MOTION IS -- TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS YOU MAY CLOSE -- THANK YOU AB SEVEN FIFTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WILL BRING NATURE TO CHILDREN AND MUCH NEEDED COMMUNITIES -- BY CREATING THE SCHOOL PAVEMENTS PARKS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK OF THE WE DON'T HAVE MOTION A MISS MISS SMITH MR MCCARTY. MOVED AND SECONDED. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS O'DONNELL. O'DONNELL I KILEY KILEY AYE KALRA MCCARTY. THE EYES SMITH SMITH I VOEPEL WEBER. FOR THE LAST FOUR VOTE SO IT IS UP. THANK YOU [inaudible] WE'RE YEAH. YEAH YEAH YEAH I'M BACK I'M GONNA HAND THIS OVER TO MISS SMITH THEN OKAY THANK YOU MISTER KILEY WHENEVER YOU'RE READY ON FILE ITEM TWENTY FOUR AB. SEVENTEEN TWENTY TWO SORRY THIS IS MAKING THEIR WAY UP. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AT SEVENTEEN TWENTY TWO I'D LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. THIS BILL WILL IMPROVE STUDENT SAFETY AND CALIFORNIA'S K. TWELVE SCHOOLS BY REQUIRING EACH SCHOOL SAFETY PLAN TO INCLUDE A TARGETED VIOLENCE PREVENTION PLAN ESTABLISHING A MULTI DISCIPLINARY THREAT ASSESSMENT TEAM. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES SCHOOL SAFETY PLANS TO THE EXTENT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO INCLUDE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES PROCEDURES AIMED AT THE PREVENTION OF BULLYING AND TO INCLUDE CLEAR GUIDELINES FOR THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES. OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. FOLLOWING A NUMBER OF TRAGIC SCHOOL ATTACKS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINE PARENTS AND STUDENTS ARE MORE CONCERNED THAN EVER ABOUT SCHOOL SAFETY. BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY THREATS MADE BY STUDENTS ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES MOST OF A TRANSIENT AND HARMLESS NATURE IT'S IMPORTANT TO QUICKLY DISTINGUISH WHICH THREATS ARE SUBSTANTIVE THREATS. POSING A CONTINUING RISK OF DANGER TO OTHERS. THE FBI AND THE SECRET SERVICE NATIONAL THREAT ASSESSMENT CENTER OR NTAC HAVE FOUND THE PERPETRATORS OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS CHAU OBSERVABLE WARNING SIGNS THAT IT ACTED UPON. MAY HAVE PREVENTED THE VIOLENT ACT. SUCH STUDENTS WERE OFTEN VICTIMS OF BULLYING WHO WOULD BECOME ANGRY AND DEPRESSED AND WERE INFLUENCED BY A VARIETY OF SOCIAL FAMILIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS HOWEVER. BECAUSE MANY OF THOSE WARNING SIGNS CAN BE FOUND IN SO MANY STUDENTS IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP ANY SORT OF PROFILING CHECKLISTS. THEREFORE BOTH THE FBI IN NTAC INSTEAD RECOMMENDED SCHOOLS ADOPT A THREAT ASSESSMENT APPROACH TO PREVENT TARGETED ACTS OF VIOLENCE. THEY ALSO THAT RECOMMEND BEST PRACTICES THAT INCLUDE DEVELOPING A CENTRAL REPORTING MECHANISM FOR SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIORS ENSURING INFORMATION IS PROMPTLY EVALUATED BY A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM. AND ENDING THE PRACTICE OF ZERO TOLERANCE PROCESS SEES THAT CAN FURTHER ISOLATE THE INDIVIDUAL. AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY TWO ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE BY REQUIRING EACH COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOL SAFETY PLAN TO INCLUDE A TARGETED VIOLENCE PREVENTION PLAN. ESTABLISHING A MULTI DISCIPLINARY THREAT ASSESSMENT TEAM OF SCHOOL PERSONNEL WHO DIRECT MANAGE AND DOCUMENT THE THREAT ASSESSMENT PROCESS. I HAVE WITH ME THIS AFTERNOON VERSE PEARSON THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY ABOUT RADO COUNTY AND MICHELLE TO STIR WHO IS A SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS MICHELLE CONCERNED I AM A HIGHLY TRAINED PASSIONATE NATIONALLY CERTIFIED SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST OVER THE PAST FOURTEEN YEARS I'VE WORKED IN FOUR STATES AND IN JUST ABOUT EVERY TYPE OF SCHOOL SYSTEM YOU CAN IMAGINE. I'M HERE TODAY REQUESTING YOUR VOTE ON AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY TWO I UNDERSTAND THERE IS OPPOSITION GIVING CONSIDERATION OF PRIVACY LAWS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR OPENING THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. YET THESE CONCERNS ARE THE ANTITHESIS OF WHAT FIELD BASED RESEARCH AND PRACTICE HAVE SHOWN US. IMPLEMENTING START ASSESSMENTS IS AN EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE FOR PREVENTING ACTS OF VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS FURTHER MORE IT OPENS PATHWAYS FOR INTERVENTION RELATIONSHIP BUILDING AND PROVIDING SAFETY NETS FOR STUDENTS WHO OTHERWISE MAY FEEL ISOLATED. AND HOPELESS WHICH ARE KEY PRECURSORS TO VIOLENT BEHAVIOR. SCHOOLS WOULD IMPLEMENT THREAT ASSESSMENT PROTOCOLS HAVE STUDENTS AND STAFF WHO ARE TRAINED ON WHAT'S A REPORT. WHERE TO REPORT AND AND WHEN TO REPORT AND THIS IS KEY SCHOOLS THAT IMPLEMENT THREAT ASSESSMENT PROTOCOLS KNOW HOW TO RESPOND? OVER THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS RESEARCH HAS REVEALED THAT AND SEVEN OUT OF TEN ACTS OF GUN VIOLENCE IN AND FOUR OUT OF FIVE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS. THE ATTACKER HAD TOLD PEOPLE OF HIS PLANS AHEAD OF TIME WE KNOW THAT IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES PEOPLE AT RISK OF HURTING THEMSELVES OR OTHERS SHOW SIGNS AND SIGNALS BEFORE THE ACT OF VIOLENCE TAKES PLACE. AND LET ME BE CLEAR THE TYPES OF THREAT REQUIRING INTERVENTION GO WELL BEYOND THE PROSPECT OF A MASS SHOOTING. AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN STUDENTS AGES TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN EXPERIENCED A RATE OF THIRTY THREE VICTIMIZATION PER ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS. THIS STATISTIC IS NOT THE NUMBER OF THREATS MADE BUT ACTUATED VIOLENCE THAT OCCURRED IN OUR SCHOOLS. WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR IT CAN BE EASY TO DISMISS THE SIGNS AND MORE OFTEN THE CASE IN OUR SCHOOLS WHEN YOU SEE THE SIGNS? BUT DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT WELL THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT CAN BE TRAGIC. WE KNOW THAT THREAT ASSESSMENTS WORK WE CAN LOOK TO OUR COLLEAGUES IN LOS ANGELES ALL THE WAY TO GLENN COUNTY. AND MANY OTHERS IN BETWEEN SAN MATTEO SANTA CRUZ SAN DIEGO AS WELL AS NUMEROUS OTHERS HAVE CHOSEN TO IMPLEMENT THREAD ASSESSMENT PROTOCOLS WITH MULTI DISCIPLINARY COALITIONS. AND THEY ARE EXPERIENCING SUCCESS THEIR ACTIONS HAVE PROTECTED AND IN RICH LIVES. THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS VERNE PEARSON I'M THAT ELECTED DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN EL DORADO COUNTY HAVE BEEN A PROSECUTOR FOR TWENTY SEVEN YEARS. BOTH AS A DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL AND DEPUTY DA AND AND ELECTED THE A THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS -- TWENTY YEARS AGO THIS PAST SATURDAY. TO ADD YOUNG MAN WENT INTO COLUMBINE HIGH SCHOOL -- LOADED TO AND PREPARED TO KILL I NEVER OF THEIR OF FELLOW CLASSMATES AT NOON ONE YEAR AGO ALMOST EXACTLY ONE YEAR AGO THE NEARLY ST VERY SIMILAR SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES HER. OCCURRED IN PARKLAND FLORIDA. NGUYEN THE THE CASE THE SHOOTER ENTERED PARKLAND FLORIDA THE FIRST ADULT THAT CAME IN CONTACT WITH THEM WAS A SCHOOL MONITOR. THE SCHOOL MONITOR IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED THIS BOY NOT BY HIS NAME BUT AS THAT IN AIR QUOTES CRAZY KID WHO WAS VOTED MOST LIKELY BY THE FACULTY TO SHOOT AT THE SCHOOL. THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE THAT TWENTY YEARS LATER WE HAVEN'T COLLECTIVELY. LEARNED THAT THERE IS BEHAVIORS THAT CAN BE READILY IDENTIFIED THAT. VEAL THAT SOMEONE MAY BE ON THE PATHWAY TO VIOLENCE SUCH AS THIS. UPS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA MUCH LIKE THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. THIS THREAD ASSESSMENT APPROACHED. HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY IMPLEMENTED IN VARIOUS -- JURISDICTIONS WHAT SEVENTEEN TWENTY TWO DOES AND THE WAY IT'S DRAFTED IS TO TRY TO TO ENABLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY TO SET FORTH A STANDARDIZED PROTOCOL NOT THE SPECIFIC DETAILS OF HOW IT'LL BE IMPLEMENTED AN INDIVIDUAL JURISDICTION. BUT A VERY SPECIFIC YOU NEED TO PLAN TO DO THIS AND YOU NEED TO USE EVIDENCE BASED. BEST PRACTICES WHICH A LOOK TO BEHAVIORS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED -- WELL IN ADVANCE. WE IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT WAIT UNTIL THERE'S ANOTHER HOT HOT HIGH PROFILE INCIDENT TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE WE TAKE ACTION ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS. AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I WOULD DEFER BACK. TO THANK YOU ANY SPEAKERS IN KEEP THE INJURY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL COUNSELORS IN SUPPORT. ANY SPEAKERS ANY ADDITIONAL SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT. HE SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON CATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. I'M FIRST LET ME THANK THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF ON A AND THE SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS TO MEET AND TALK TO US ABOUT OUR CONCERNS -- UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE YET AT THE POINT OF HAVING REACHED AGREEMENT ON WHAT WOULD BE NEEDED IN THIS LEGISLATION TO ALLOW SCHOOLS TO EFFECTIVELY ASSESS THREATS. WHILE ENSURING EQUITY AND PROTECTING STUDENTS RIGHTS. WE ALL AGREE ON THE GOAL OF SAFER SCHOOLS AND THAT WE SHOULD WORK TO PREVENT VIOLENT INCIDENTS RATHER THAN JUST REACTING WHEN THEY OCCUR. WELL THE USE OF THREAT ASSESSMENTS TWO TEAMS TO ASSESS AND RESPOND TO POTENTIAL THREATS OF VIOLENCE CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING SCHOOL VIOLENCE AND CAN BE DONE IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS STUDENT RIGHTS. THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS. WHEN THREAT ASSESSMENT TEAMS DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE REPRESENTATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND INSTEAD HAVE AN OVER REPRESENTATION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL? AND WHEN THE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK FOR THREAT ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES DOES NOT EXPLICITLY PROVIDE PROTECTIONS FOR STUDENT RIGHTS. IT IS ALL TOO EASY FOR THE WORK OF A THREAT ASSESSMENT TEAM TO BECOME ONE MORE WAY THAT PUSHES STUDENTS OUT OF SCHOOL AND INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. RATHER THAN PROVIDING WITH THEM WITH THE SUPPORT AND SERVICES THEY NEED. SCHOOL CLIMATE CAN BE HARMED IF STUDENTS FEEL THEY MAY BE UNFAIRLY TARGETED FOR DISCIPLINE OR EVEN LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERVENTION ON THE BASIS OF ANONYMOUS REPORTS. WITHOUT ADEQUATE SAFEGUARDS THE OUTCOMES OF THE THREAT ASSESSMENTS WILL LIKELY HAVE A DISPARATE IMPACT ON STUDENTS OF COLOR AND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. UNFORTUNATELY IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS TODAY WE KNOW THAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES STAFFING IS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE. MANY SCHOOLS HAVE A SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER BUT NOPE COUNSELORS WHATSOEVER. IN THIS ENVIRONMENT AND ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE LACK OF EXPLICIT PROTECTIONS IN THE LANGUAGE OF AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY TWO THE THREAT ASSESSMENT TEAMS REQUIRED UNDER THE BILL WILL ALL TOO LIKELY HAVE AN OVERALL HARMFUL EFFECT ON SCHOOL CLIMATE. AS A STARTING POINT WE BELIEVE THAT ANY LEGISLATION REQUIRING THREAT ASSESSMENT TEAMS MUST HAVE CERTAIN SPECIFIC PROTECTIONS SET OUT IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL. MOST THREATS ARE STE TRANSIENT AND THE THREAT ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES SHOULD HAVE THE GOAL OF KEEPING STUDENTS IN SCHOOL WHENEVER POSSIBLE. PEARLS TO THREAD ASSESSMENT TEAMS SHOULD ONLY OCCUR WHEN THERE IS A REASONABLE BASIS TO CONCLUDE THAT THE STUDENT HAS ENGAGED IN CONDUCT THAT INDICATES A THREAT. THE STUDENT AND STUDENTS PARENTS SHOULD RECEIVE WRITTEN NOTICE WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF A REFERRAL TO A THREAT ASSESSMENT TEAM. PROTECTIONS MUST BE PUT IN PLACE TO ENSURE THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS IS PROTECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH EXISTING LAW AND REPORTS AND EVALUATIONS FROM THE THREAT ASSESSMENT TEAM SHOULD NOT BECOME PART OF THE STUDENTS DISCIPLINARY RECORD. FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES THE STUDENT'S I EP TEAM SHOULD BE CONVENE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE BEHAVIOR WAS A MANIFESTATION OF THE STUDENTS DISABILITY. FINALLY LEGISLATION SHOULD REQUIRE REPORTING ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS BY EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT INCLUDING WHO IS ON THE THREAT ASSESSMENT TEAM HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE REFERRED FOR ASSESSMENTS AND THE OUTCOMES OF THE ASSESSMENTS -- THESE DATA SHOULD BE REVIEWED PRAYER PERIODICALLY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON CERTAIN STUDENT GROUPS. THERE ARE GOOD MODELS OUT THERE AS TO HOW THE WORK SHOULD BE DONE THE VIRGINIA STUDENT THREAT ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES WHICH ARE AT THE BELIEVE MENTIONED IN THE AUTHOR'S FACT SHEET -- HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE RESULT IN FEWER SUSPENSIONS AND LESSEN DISPARITIES IN SUSPENSION RATES -- THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF ESSENTIAL FEATURES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THOSE RESULTS THEY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TRANSIENT AND SUBSTITUTED THREATS THEY EMPHASIZE A FLEXIBLE NON PUNITIVE APPROACH THAT DISCOURAGES EXCLUSIONARY DISCIPLINE IN MOST CASES. AND THEY REQUIRE STANDARDIZED RESEARCH PROVEN STRAINING FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE THREAT ASSESSMENT TEAMS. IF CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO PUT IN PLACE REQUIREMENTS FOR THREAT ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES IN AT SCHOOL IT NEEDS TO EXERCISE THE UTMOST CARE TO ENSURE THAT THE PROCEDURES ACTUALLY BENEFIT SCHOOL SEVEN SAFETY AND PROTECT STUDENTS RIGHTS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY TWO IN ITS CURRENT FORM HAS THE NECESSARY PROTECTIONS TO MEET THOSE GOALS AND RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NOSE. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS. I MOVED TO BILL PLEASE. NO THE COMMONS MR KILEY WOULD YOU LIKE CLOSE. UP OUTSIDE YEAH [inaudible] SORRY. YES I I DID HAVE A SOME QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR MAYBE YOUR TEAM SO. I AM I'M. A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THE THE ISSUES OUTLINED BY BY THE SEA WITH A SEAL YOU AS YOU KNOW WE HAD THIS DEBATE IN COMMITTEE TWO WEEKS AGO WITH MR CHAN'S BILL ON MORE SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS AND CONVERSELY THE NEED FOR COUNSELORS AS WELL I KNOW THAT YOU'RE SAYING. NOT EITHER OR BUT I I AM CONCERNED THAT THAT WOULD BE. THE REMEDY AND FOR ONE YOU KNOW DISTRICTS ARE STRAPPED THERE'S NO FUNDING SOURCE TO GUARANTEE THAT. AND INTO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE AS MANY SCHOOL COUNSELORS PSYCHOLOGISTS MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. ON CAMPUS AS WELL SO ONE IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT -- THIS NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO IS THAT YOU KNOW. I I HEAR YOUR EXAMPLE IN COLUMBINE BUT THE TRAGEDY IN FLORIDA WE HAD A SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER AND UNFORTUNATELY. IT DIDN'T HELP THE SITUATION -- SO IT'S NOT ALWAYS A GUARANTEE AND THEN I GUESS THE THIRD THING SO IF ONE OF THE FIRST THING THIS THE THIRD THEY RESPOND TO IS AND THEN ALSO TALKED ABOUT HER THE LETTER. THAT THERE WAS A BILL LAST YEAR THAT WE VOTED ON AND APPROVED WHICH TALKS ABOUT SCHOOL SAFETY PLANS TO RODRIGUEZ HIS PROPOSAL AND HOW THIS. COMPLIMENTS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY -- IS DUPLICATIVE SO. GO IT'S OKAY WITH YOU CAN I GET MY WITH THIS A CHANCE DANCER THAT HAPPY TO ADDRESS AS WELL. AND THANK OU FOR THE QUESTIONS I THINK THERE -- VERY IMPORTANT ONCE A AND AS FOR THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE THE ACLU REPRESENTATIVE AND AND I HAVE MET WITH HER AND DISCUSS STATE AND I SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS IN TERMS OF PRIVACY IN MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOING IT UNDER THE USING THE BEST PRACTICES. BUT THE SPECIFICALLY AS THE PARKLAND AND AND SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER THAT -- WAS ON CAMPUS -- PRIOR TO PARKLAND TAKING PLACE. FLORIDA DID NOT HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH A SET OF STANDARDS THAT USE BEST PRACTICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YEAH I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH YOU FOLLOW IN TERMS OF PARKLAND BUT AT ALL I WAS VERY DISTURBED WHEN I READ THE FULL REPORT AND I'VE DONE A COUPLE PRESENTATIONS ON IT. NOT ONLY DID THE SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER HAVE INFORMATION IN ITS POSSESSION THAT WOULD HAVE WAS IT WHERE THEY'RE A THREAT MANAGEMENT TEAM SUCH A CORPORATE TALKING ABOUT. IN ALL HE HAD A INFORMATION THAT WAS REQUESTED BY COUNSELOR ON CAMPUS -- ABOUT THE STUDENT AND HE REFUSED TO RELEASE THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE HE WAS CONCERNED THAT IT WAS LAW ENFORCEMENT SENSITIVE. AND HE WOULDN'T REALLY SAID HE HAD NOT BEEN PROPERLY TRAINED -- AND IN THE LIST GOES ON AND ON AND ON THE PROBLEM WITH IT. LET ME GIVE ME ONE OF THE WORST ONES I DON'T KNOW BURKE MOST THE PUBLIC IS UNAWARE. THAT THE FIRST PEOPLE THIS IS -- PARK WHEN DID LOCATION THAT HIGH SCHOOL IS ACTUALLY IN BROWARD COUNTY IT WAS A BROWARD COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPUTY WHO IS A SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER. THE FIRST POLICE OFFICERS THAT ENTERED THAT CAMPUS AFTER THE SHOOTING BEGAN -- WERE FROM CORAL SPRINGS A NEIGHBORING JURISDICTION THAT WOULD NOT WAIT THAT IS THE STANDARD PRACTICE THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO ENTER IN BROWARD COUNTY BECAUSE OF THE DYSFUNCTION NOW THAT HE WITH AND THAT SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. DID NOT PROPERLY HANDLE THAT SITUATION THE BILL LAST YEAR READ RODRIGUEZ IS A VERY GOOD FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ IT'S A VERY GOOD BILL. BUT THROUGHOUT MY CAREER TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OF DOING THIS WHAT I HAVE SEEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS WE REACT TO THINGS AFTER THE THE CRISIS AS A BEGUN -- AFTER THE FIRST SHOT HAS BEEN FIRED WITH THIS APPROACH IS IS TO TAKE IT BACK AND MOVE THE TIMELINE BACK AND TRY TO INTERCEDE BEFORE IT EVER GETS TO THAT POINT -- AIMED AT RODRIGUEZ IS BILL OUT OF ALL THE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AGAIN IT GOES TO WHAT DO YOU DO AFTER THE FIRST SHOT HAS BEEN FIRED -- THE IMPORTANT THING I THINK BE A BOB EVERYTHING ELSE IS CALIFORNIA SHOULD ADOPT A STANDARD ONE THAT WE CAN WORK OUT THAT AT RENT RECONCILES PRIVACY CONCERNS WHAT GOES IN A CHILD'S ACUMEN FILE ALL OF THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. BUT THAT IT'S A STANDARD THAT EVERY COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA CAN LOOK AT AND SAY THESE ARE THE BEST PRACTICES. THIS IS THE WAY WE SHOULD DO IT AND COUNTIES ARE NOT LEFT TO THEMSELVES TO DO THIS ON AN AD HOC BASIS THE WAY THEY THINK THE BASS. AND I'M I'M VERY MUCH FOR COUNTIES BEING ABLE TO MAKE THOSE TYPES OF DECISIONS BUT IF THEY'RE NOT FOLLOWING THE BEST PRACTICES THEN THEY'RE NOT DOING IT PROPERLY. I HOPE THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION. I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE SOME SOME BACKGROUND FROM A SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS -- POSITION SO WHEN I STARTED MY CAREER IT WAS OUTSIDE OF BALTIMORE. IN MARYLAND AND I WORKED IN AN ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT HAD VERY AT RISK YOUTH. AND I WAS TRAINED IN MY SECOND YEAR OUT ON HOW TO BE A PART OF A MULTI DISCIPLINARY THREAT ASSESSMENT TEAM AND I EXECUTED THREAT ASSESSMENTS -- WITH RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE SUPERINTENDENT. THERE IS A THRESHOLD FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT INVOLVEMENT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THIS IS NOT. THAT THE EMPHASIS BEING ON THE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PIECE OF ME IS SECONDARY TO THE EMPHASIS IN TRAINING EDUCATORS AND ADMINISTRATORS AND AND PROVIDING -- DIRECTION ON WHAT YOU DO WHENEVER YOU HAVE AS A CREDIBLE THREAT AND SPEAKING AGAIN AS SOMEBODY WHO IS IN YOUR SCHOOLS AND THE LAST SEVEN YEARS. I I CAN SPEAK. TO ME UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE PUSH BACK HAS BEEN BECAUSE THERE IS NOT DIRECTION FOR ADMINISTRATORS ON WHAT TO DO. AND IT AND AGAIN ONE PERSON -- BUT VERY PASSIOATE ABOUT BEING PROACTIVE ON THIS TOPIC AND AND DO A CORNELL'S RESEARCH OUT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA IS IS BY FAR THE THE THE DIRECTION THAT THAT WE NEED. TO ADD HERE. TOO RIGHT SO I THINK VERY SPECIFICALLY MISTER COLLEY TO YOU TO YOUR WITNESSES POINT JUST NOW I THINK WHAT ADMINISTRATIVE TEAMS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE IN NEED OF PARTICULARLY IN WHAT IS THIS UNFORTUNATE NEW NORMAL. IS CLARITY AND I DO THINK THAT THE POINTS IN OPPOSITION RAISED BY THE ACLU PARTICULARLY HER MULTI POINT -- THINKING ON ON WHAT SHOULD BE ADDED TO PROVIDE THAT CLARITY WOULD BE WORTH CONSIDERING IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE WERE CONSIDERING TAKING UP YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE A QUITE A BIT OF COMMON GROUND HERE I MEAN THAT. THE POINT IS CERTAINLY NOT -- TO GET MORE KIDS INTO THE A LITTLE JUSTICE SYSTEM I THINK TO THE CONTRARY -- ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF HAVING -- A SET OF BEST PRACTICES IN A PROTOCOL IS NOT ONLY THE YOU MAKE SURE YOU DON'T MISS TRUE WARNING SIGNS BUT ALSO THAT YOU DOWNTOWN I OVER REACT TO THINGS THAT ARE -- HARMLESS AND TRANSIENT AND SO I THINK THAT THE BILL SERVES THAT PURPOSE AND THAT MISTER MCCARTY'S POINTS ARE WELL TAKEN I MEAN THIS IS IT NEEDS TO BE COUPLED. WITH A RENEWED FOCUS ON MENTAL HEALTH -- AND THE PROFESSIONALS WHO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN OUR SCHOOLS YOU KNOW WE HAD A INFORMATIONAL HEARING THIS COMMITTEE A COUPLE MONTHS AGO ON THAT TOPIC AND STEMMING FROM THAT AT CHAIR O'DONNELL AND HIGHER.

AT THE FEDERALLEVEL IT'S AN ISSUE I KNOW MANY OF US ARE CONCERNED ABOUT FRANKLY. PROBABLY REASON MY MANY OF US FROM THESE JOBS IS BECAUSE WE CARE ABOUT THIS AND WANT TO CREATE. A STRONG SOCIAL SAFETY NET I WE WANT ENSURE OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS TO HOUSING AND FOOD AND THE HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED -- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE LITERALLY MILLIONS OF CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY? MILLIONS OF CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY IN THE STATE. AND IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS AROUND THOSE CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY IT'S DISPROPORTIONATELY KIDS OF COLOR. NO THERE'S A RACIAL INEQUITY ISSUE HERE THAT I KNOW MANY OF YOU HAVE WORKED ON THESE ISSUES BUT I KNOW DR A LOT OF OUR WORK IN A LOT OF OUR THINKING -- A LOT OF THESE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES LIKE THAT LACK THE ACCESS -- AND RESOURCES TO EDUCATIONAL. RESOURCES TO HEALTH THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SUCH TRIBE WE HAD A REALLY GOOD PROGRAM HERE IN CALIFORNIA CALLED HEALTHY START. AND IT EXISTED FROM NINETEEN NINETY TWO TO TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN IT WAS ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION -- ADDED IN SHORT THAT DOES THERE WAS FUNDING FOR TO ENSURE THAT KIDS HAD ACCESS TO THESE RESOURCES TO ACCESS IS. TO TO TO MEDI CAL TO CAL FOR US TO MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES. THAT PROGRAM ENDED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND WHAT MY BILL IS DESIGNED TO DO IS -- TO START TO HEALTHY START INITIATIVE AGAIN HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND ENSURE THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO CREATE THAT SOCIAL SAFETY NET TO ENSURE THAT OUR KIDS THAT MOST NEEDED THE MOST DESPERATELY NEED. TO GET THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED A WE KNOW WHEN THEY GET THESE RESOURCES WE SEE AN INCREASE AND IMMUNIZATIONS WE SEE IT -- BETTER SCORES IN READING AND AND MATH WE SEE A DECREASE IN DRUG USAGE. THIS IS THE THINGS THESE ARE THE THINGS WE SHOULD BE DOING -- IN OUR COMMUNITIES -- THAT IS WHAT MY BILL IS AIMED TO DO -- IS IS TO RESTART THE HEALTHY START INITIATIVE -- I WANT TO THANK MY SPONSORS ON THIS BILL UNITED WAY OF CALIFORNIA THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND AS WELL.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR IN MEMBERS MY NAME IS LINDSAY CALLAHAN I AM THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF UNITED WAY FRESNO MADERA COUNTIES. I'M HONORED TO BE PROVIDING TESTIMONY ON SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT SEVENTY FIVE ON HEALTHY START TWO POINT NO WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL. AND THANKS TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE WE ALL WANT OUR CHILDREN TO BE HAPPY WE ALL WONDER CHILDREN TO BE HEALTHY WE ALL WANT OUR CHILDREN TO THRIVE. BUT CALIFORNIA FRANKLY HAS UNEVEN TRACK RECORD. WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING GOOD ON OUR SHARED GOALS OF HEALTHY BEGINNINGS A NURTURING ENVIRONMENTS? INSTEAD WE'VE CREATED A SILO SYSTEM THAT REACTS ONLY WHEN CHILDREN ARE CLEARLY STRUGGLING IN IN CRISIS AND EVEN THEN TOO OFTEN WE'RE NOT SITUATED TO ACTUALLY RESPOND AND WE FAIL THE CHILDREN WHO ARE STRUGGLING. WE KNOW THAT OUR CHILDREN WHO ARE ENGLISH LEARNERS. FOSTER YOUTH AND COME FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES FACE THESE ISSUES EVEN MORE DISPROPORTIONATELY. IT'S A STARK REALITY THAT AYE PAIN I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT IT'S ONE THAT I'VE SEEN IN MY COMMUNITY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND ONE I'VE SEEN STATEWIDE IN THE WORK THAT I'VE DONE OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN AND YOUTH. TODAY I'M HERE TO SAY THAT WE CAN DO BETTER. WE CAN DO BETTER THAN JUST TRYING TO DIMINISH HARMER LESSEN INEQUITIES WE HAVE BUILT WE CAN CREATE GOOD IN AB EIGHT SEVENTY FIVE DOES JUST THAT. IN MY COMMUNITY WE OFTEN SAY TOGETHER WE ARE BETTER. HEALTHY START AS ENVISIONED BY THIS BILL HAS THE SAME PREMISE IT'S OUR DUTIES DUTY AS PUBLIC SERVANTS. TO ACT COLLECTIVELY TO PROVIDE CHILDREN FAMILIES WITH ALL THE TOOL SUPPORTS AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY NEED TO LIVE FULL LIVES AND THE SIMPLE FACT THAT IS THAT THE SCHOOL. IS A WHERE GREAT DEAL THE CHILDHOOD HAPPENS AND IT JUST MAKES SENSE TO USE THIS AS A NATURAL HUB TO INTEGRATE SERVICES FOR MENTAL HEALTH FOOD ACCESS ECONOMIC CHIEF OF SUPPORT AND REALLY SO MUCH MORE THE LIST GOES ON AND ON THIS IS HOW WE CAN ADDRESS THE VERY. REAL ISSUES THAT ARE MANY THAT ARE FAMILIES AND CHILDREN ARE FACING. HEALTHY START TO POINT -- CONFRONTS THE CHALLENGES WITH AN ARRAY OF COMMUNITY RESPONSE OF STRATEGIES THAT ARE PROACTIVE IN LEVERAGING THE MANY LOCAL FUNDING SOURCES ALREADY IN EXISTENCE. I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND HOW WRAPPING CHILDREN FAMILIES IN THE COORDINATED SUPPORT THEY NEED AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE DRAMATICALLY ALTERS THE COURSE OF THEIR LIVES FOR THE BETTER. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AIDS AB EIGHT SEVENTY FIVE THANK YOU.

SOMETIMES WE ALWAYS MENTION HIS NAME WITH GOOD THOUGHTS BUT THIS WAS A BIPARTISAN ISSUE -- AND WE HAVE THIS GOING ON FOR FIFTEEN YEARS -- AND OF COURSE DURING THE GREAT RECESSION WE WALKED A LOT OF STUFF IN THIS THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ONE OF THOSE PROGRAMS AND SO. YOU KNOW REALLY THIS IS AN ISSUE% FOR OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE WHICH I'M I'M PART OF AND WORKING WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE FRANKLY WE PROBABLY FUND OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. BECAUSE THAT'S THE OTHER FLIPSIDE IS IS THAT NOT ONLY DO WE WHACK A LOS STUFF DURING THE RECESSION WHEN WE RECOVERED. WE REFUNDED -- PROGRAMS THROUGH OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS BUT SAID WE WANTED TO SQUEEZE THESE CATEGORICAL AS AN LED DISTRICTS ASIDE SO CONCEIVABLY. IN EL SAX CITY DISTRICT COULD CREATE THESE HEALTHY START PROGRAMS IN OAKLAND BUT AS WE KNOW. THERE'S STRUGGLING JUST KEEP THE LIGHTS ON AND SO I'M I'M ALL IN ON THIS SITE I REMEMBER VISITING MY FIRST FIRST FIVE SITE IN -- MIGHT THE FORMER CITY COUNCIL DISTRICT. AND I SAW THE WORK THAT THEY DID THEIR WITH FAMILIES AND KIDS AFTER SCHOOL AND THEY MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THEIR BIG PART OF THE COMMUNITY CELL AYE I AM ALL IN ON THESE HEALTHY START -- INITIATIVES IN SUPPORT THIS TO POINT OUT -- BUT BUT AGAIN I JUST YOU KNOW THE REALITY CHECK IS THAT WE NEED TO WORK ON ADEQUATE FUNDING OF OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN. RE GREEN LIGHT EFFORTS LIKE THIS YEP THANKS AGREE. I ECHO MISTER MCCARTY'S AND YOU KNOW SUPPORT THE MEASURE FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS YOU KNOW IT EARLIER AND IN IN COMMITTEE TODAY WE PASSED A MEASURE FOR GRANT PROGRAMS FOR COMMUNITY SCHOOLS RIGHT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IT'S THESE HOLISTIC.

FILE ITEM ONE MEASURE ONE TWO THREE JUST YOU AND I HERE. WELL THANK YOU -- MADAM VICE VICE CHAIR. FIRST OF ALL LIKE. TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS MEASURE THIS OF COURSE IS AB. ONE TWO THREE IT'S THAT PRE K. FOR ALL BILL AND WE THINK IT SHOULD BE EASY AS ONE TWO THREE SIMPLE AS THAT YOU KNOW. IT'S TIME THAT CALIFORNIA STEPS UP AND FOR FEELS THE PROMISE OF PRESCHOOL FOR ALL. NO WE HAD STATES ACROSS THE NATION THAT ARE THAT ARE DOING THIS RED STATES. AND AND BLUE STATES IN CALIFORNIA LEADS IN SO MANY ISSUES BUT THIS ONE WERE UNFORTUNATELY BEHIND AND THERE ARE. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA KIDS WHO START KINDERGARTEN EVERY YEAR. WHO HAD HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO A QUALITY EARLY EDUCATION AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO EXIST AND THAT'S THAT'S THE WHY WHY THIS MATTERS BECAUSE? WE WANT TO ADDRESS THE STUBBORN AND LINGERING EDUCATION ACHIEVEMENT GAP. WE WANT TO ADDRESS -- POVERTY SPECIFICALLY INTERGENERATIONAL POVERTY. AND OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE WAS THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. THE NUMBER ONE PLACE THAT YOU COULD INVEST THAT RESEARCH SHOWS IS EARLY EDUCATION AND THAT'S WHAT THAT THIS MEASURE IS ALL ABOUT. SO THIS WOULD GO WOULD CREATE -- A AN EFFORT HERE IT'S NOT A NEW PROGRAM WE WOULD BUILD UPON OUR EXISTING CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM TO EXPAND ELIGIBILITY. TO NEARLY SEVENTY THOUSAND THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS IN CALIFORNIA WE FOCUS ON INCREASING QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE WORK FORCE. AND PROVIDE THEM A RESOURCE AND SCHOLARSHIPS TO FOCUS ON GETTING THIS THESE NEW EDUCATION -- THAT IS THE EDUCATION UP PIECES TO IT TO HELP IN THEIR CLASSROOMS IN THEIR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. AND WE WOULD ALSO FOCUS ON INCREASING PAY FOR THE WORK FORCE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT. A STABLE WORKFORCE MEANS QUALITY AND CERTAINLY HELPS THE THE THE EXISTING WORKFORCE AS WELL. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT -- WE CAN'T DO THIS OVERNIGHT SO THIS EFFORT IS THAT WE CALL TARGETED UNIVERSALISM IT'S A FIRST OUT STEP OF A OF A HOPEFULLY. THEY AT A THREE TO FIVE YEAR PERIOD TO FOCUS ON PRESCHOOL FOR ALL IN CALIFORNIA FOCUSINGON THE KIDS WHO NEEDED THE MOST. AND WE HAVE VISITED STATES THROUGHOUT THE NATION TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY HAVE DONE IT AND WE BROUGHT BACK THIS EFFORT HERE. ALSO PROUD TO KNOW THAT ARE ASSEMBLY BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION WHICH HAS BEEN NOTED TODAY A BLU RAY COMMISSION EARLY EDUCATION FOCUS ON THESE EXACT ELEMENTS ARE LOOKING AT BEST PRACTICES WHAT COULD BE DONE. CERTAINLY THAT THE GOVERNOR IS TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR LOOKING AT OUR BUDGET PROCESS BUT THIS IS A COMPANION LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL. THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET -- PASSED THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR SO WITH ME TODAY ARE BY THE STEELERS ON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FROM EARLY ADS CALIFORNIA. AND DR BETTY ROBINSON HARRISON EARLY EDUCATOR FROM THE PAST STAFF UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA. FEDERATION OF TEACHERS THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON TANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. MY NAME IS DOCTOR PENNY ROBINSON HARRIS I AM IN THE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATOR IN THE SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. I'M CELEBRATING FORTY SEVEN YEARS AND WORKING WITH YOUNG CHILDREN.

I AM THE CHAIR OF THE CHILD DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE FOR SAFETY WHO IS A CO SPONSOR. BUT I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING -- MANY OR THE CHILD EDUCATION TEACHERS AND EDUCATORS TO TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. I KNOW FIRST HAND THE VALUE OF EARLY TO OUT EDUCATION I LIVE IT EVERY DAY. IN THE FAMILIES INTO WE OFTEN FEARFUL CHILDREN IN TWO YEARS. OF THE LITTLE ONES -- FEARFUL BUT GRADUATING LEAVING THE SCHOOLS STRONG FEARLESS A THIRD OF AN READY TO TAKE ON THE WORLD. I WITNESS THE MAGIC OF RELATIONSHIPS WHEN WE SEE PARENTS GUARDIANS AND CARETAKERS DAILY. AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE ON HILL WHO CAME INTO MY CLASSROOM THREE YEARS AGO -- THREE YEARS OLD NO ENGLISH. HIS MOMMY STILL IN MEXICO. HIS BROTHER SAID TO HIM LESS THAN -- NINE MONTHS LATER WHAT DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH. BETTER THAN ME. I ALSO REFERENCE OF FAMILY THAT I I WORKED WITH DEAL CAME IN WITH GRANDMOTHER. DAVE CAME IN WITH A MOTHER. SEAN CAME IN WITH GRANDMOTHER BUT JUNE CAME IN WITH MOM. AND MOM HEAD REHABILITATIVE HERSELF. HAD WITH THE SCHOOL. HAD TRAINED TO BECOME A BUS DRIVER. AND JOHN THE FIRST CHAU. GRADUATED IN WITH THE WEST POINT.

OH THIS IS EASY NO -- YOU KNOW THE TEACHERS REQUIRE A LOT OF SUPPORT AND RECOGNITIONS THAT IS NOT RIGHT NOTE THAT WE NEED TO WORK ON SO I THINK. YOU KNOW THE GOOD THING ABOUT AB ONE TWO THREE IS THAT -- IN ADDITION TO EXPANDING AXIS WHICH IS REALLY NEEDED IT'S ALSO THINKING ABOUT QUALITY. AND WE BELIEVE THAT -- INVESTING IN OUR TEACHERS IT'S ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS AT TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY IN THE CLASSROOMS SO -- YOU KNOW ITS -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY MENTION WE DID A TOUR -- TO THE EAST COAST AND SERVE -- SOME REALLY HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS AND THE COMMON ELEMENT BETWEEN THESE CITIES WAS THAT THE SUPPORT TO THE TEACHERS SO ALL TEACHERS HOW TO BE A PLUS AND CREDENTIAL. THEY WERE ALL PAID AT PARITY WITH KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS AND THEY ALSO I RECEIVED COACHING SO I THINK YOU KNOW THAT WITH THE KEY TAKE AWAY -- YOU KNOW THE ALL THESE ELEMENTS HAVE THE TO BE PRESENT AND I THINK THAT AB ONE TWO THREE IS -- IS SUPPORTING THAT PIECE -- SO AS WE ALL SAID YOU KNOW WE KNOW THE RESEARCH ARE LEARNING WORKS SO -- IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO TO STEP UP AND YOU KNOW SUPPORT OUR TEACHERS AND PROVIDE ACCESS TO ALL THE KIDS THAT NEED IT -- SO AT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO ALL FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU.

TRANSGENDER NON BINARY STUDENTS FACE MANY BARRIERS IN SCHOOL IN THE WORKPLACE OUR STATE IS TAKING MANY STEPS TO MAKE SURE THAT TRANSGENDER STUDENTS WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN SCHOOL PROTECTED AND ABLE TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN SCHOOL ACTIVITIES. BUT THE LAWS BEEN SILENT ON THE RIGHTS OF FORMER STUDENTS WHO MAY HAVE TRANSITION OR OTHERWISE COME OUT AFTER LEAVING SCHOOL. THIS IS A SIMPLE BILL WOULD ENSURE THAT TRANSGENDER AND NON BINARY PEOPLE WHO ARE NO LONGER IN SCHOOL HAVE THE ABILITY TO UPDATE OLD DIPLOMAS AND TRANSCRIPTS REFLECT. THEIR CORRECT AND LEGAL NAME IF THEY DON'T HAVE THIS THEY CAN CURRENTLY FACE CHALLENGES APPLYING FOR SCHOOL OR EMPLOYMENT. IF A PERSON'S TRANSCRIPT HAS THE WRONG NAME A DOCUMENT CAN OUT THAT PERSON AS TRANSGENDER TO ANYONE WHO SEES IT WE'VE HEARD STORIES OF INDIVIDUALS WHO SUPERVISOR SAW INCORRECT NAMES ON THEIR DVDS. AND OUT OF THEM TO THEIR CO WORKERS. OUR STATE ALREADY REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO RECOGNIZE A TRANSGENDER NON BINARY STUDENTS NAME OR GENDER. CHANGE COURT ORDER AND UP TO A PERMANENT RECORDS THIS BILL WOULD CLOSE THE GAP IN THE LAW ENSURE THAT STUDENTS -- WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS AFTER THEY GRADUATE WITH THAT LIKE TO TURN OVER TO A WITNESS.

AND THIS COMPOUNDS THE SOCIETAL BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING THAT LGBTQ PEOPLE ALREADY FACE. EIGHTY SEVEN ELEVEN IS A COMMON SENSE BILL THAT WILL ADDRESS THIS INEQUITY. AND SAFEGUARD THE PRIVACY OF ALL GRADUATES INCLUDING A TRANSGENDER AND NON BINARY GRADUATES AND SURE THE EDUCATIONAL RECORDS ARE ACCURATE SO WE'RE GRATEFUL TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU FOR HIS ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE AND RESPECTFULLY URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT AS WELL.

THAT'S WHAT I'VE OF THANK YOU IMAGES SECOND THE CLERK WILL CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS O'DONNELL. HI O'DONNELL AYE KILEY KALRA MCCARTY. MCCARTY AYE SMITH SMITH I VOEPEL WEBER [inaudible] YEAH. MR TERRIO THREE VOTE SO IT'S ON CALL IS NOT HERE. SERVICE AGUIAR-CURRY GUESS AGO -- IT'S FILE ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN THE WRITING EITHER TO ME OR YOU. BUT I I I I'M NOT GONNA CALL PEOPLE THEY CAN'T WRITE. YOU CAN DO THIS. YOU CAN DO THIS -- EIGHTY NINE FIFTY EIGHT I WOULDN'T ACCEPT A MY CLASSROOM JUST SO YOU KNOW. IT'S A LOT HIGHER EXPECTATIONS OF YOU YOU SHOULD HAVE OF YOURSELF A LOT OF THAT NAME. YOU MAY RECEIVE ALREADY ON TAKE YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS FIRST I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WHICH ARE IN LINE WITH THE INTENT OF MY BILL. AB NINE FIFTY EIGHT CREATES THE CALIFORNIA ORGANIC. ORGANIC TO SCHOOL PILOT PROGRAM WHICH WILL ALLOW SCHOOLS TO APPLY FOR UP TO FIFTEEN CENTS OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING PER SCHOOL MEAL TO PURCHASE ORGANIC CALIFORNIA GROWN LOCALLY PRODUCED FOODS. SCHOOL MEALS PROVIDE PRIMARY SOURCE OF FOOD AND NUTRITION FOR MILLIONS OF PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS AND ARE A MAJOR SUPPORT FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES. WELL COST AND AVAILABILITY ISSUES PREVENT MANY COMMUTERS FROM A SET ACCESSING LOCAL AND IN SEASON FOODS. MEALS PROVIDED IN THE SCHOOL SETTING ARE A PRACTICAL WAY TO INCREASE CHILDREN'S NUTRITION. THIS BILL IS THE TRUE PILOT WOULD WOULD WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT. IS TO DETERMINE ITS SUCCESS BOTH THE PARTICIPATING SCHOOLS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE WILL REPORT BACK TO US ON THE OUTCOMES. THIS INFORMATION WILL ALLOW US TO DECIDE WHETHER INVESTING IN PROVIDING KIDS WITH HEALTHY LOCAL FOOD IS MONEY WELL SPENT. TOGETHER WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS WE HAVE MADE A BUDGET REQUEST TO FUND THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE IMPORTANCE OF PROVIDING IT'S IT'LL THE IMPORTANCE APPROVING ITS WORTH. I HAVE TWO WITNESSES HERE TODAY OR MAYBE. THREE WHICH WHAT'S THE FIRST -- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM DAVE RUNS AND I'M THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE COMMUNITY ALLIANCE WITH FAMILY FARMERS SAID DAVIS [inaudible] WE HAVE. PROMOTED ORGANIC FARMING SINCE THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND SO WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL -- MANY OF OUR MEMBERS SAID OUR ORGANIC FARMERS AND WE FOUND THAT QUITE A NUMBER THEM SELL ORGANIC PRODUCE -- TO LOCAL SCHOOLS FOR EXAMPLE SEVERAL ORGANIC FARMERS IN YOLO COUNTY SELL PRODUCE TO THE WINNERS SCHOOL DISTRICT. WHERE -- THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN WAS -- MAYOR. OF COURSE IN THE LARGER URBAN AREAS. SUCH PRODUCE WILL COME FROM LARGE FARMING OPERATIONS BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL THOUSAND ORGANIC FARMERS IN CALIFORNIA NOW. INCLUDING OVER ONE THIRD OF THE MEMBERS OF WESTERN GROWERS SAID -- PRODUCE SAID ORGANIC PRODUCE. AND AND SO THE PRICE DIFFERENTIAL FOR ORGANIC PRODUCE HAS AS SHRUNK OVER THE YEARS AND ISN'T QUITE WHAT IT ONCE WAS. BUT IT WHERE IT DOES COST MORE IT'S OFTEN BECAUSE THE COST OF PRODUCTION OR HIGHER FOR INSTANCE YOU CAN'T. SPRAY HERBICIDES ON WEEDS -- IN ORGANIC PRODUCTION. HALF OF OUR ORGANIZATION WE OPERATE A PROGRAM TO ASSIST SCHOOLS WITH BIDS FROM DISTRIBUTORS -- TO ALLOW THE SCHOOLS TO ACCESS LOCAL ORGANIC PRODUCE. MOST OF THE STUDENTS IN THESE DISTRICTS RECEIVE FREE OR REDUCED PRICE MEALS. THERE'S A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM FROM THE DISTRICTS WHAT THEY LACK IS -- FUNDING. SO THIS PRIDE PROGRAM WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW ADDITIONAL FUNDING CAN INCREASE THE USE OF LOCAL ORGANIC PRODUCE. IN MEALS SERVED TO THESE POOR CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL MARKETS -- FOR CALIFORNIA FARMERS SO -- WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M ALISON JOHNSON SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THEM NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL THE OTHER CO SPONSOR OF IT. EIGHTY NINE FIFTY EIGHT WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS LEADERSHIP IN BRINGING MORE GOOD FOOD TO SCHOOLS AND WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT THE ORGANIC TO SCHOOL PILOT PROGRAM. ONE CORD DOMED THE DIRECTOR OF CHILD NUTRITION AT VACAVILLE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WANTED TO BE HERE TODAY TO SPEAK BUT UNFORTUNATELY HAD A CONFLICT ARISE SO I'M GOING TO PASS ON A FEW COMMENTS FROM HIM. FIRST IN HIS YEARS IN SCHOOL NUTRITION ONE HAS WITNESSED A TANGIBLE INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR HEALTHY FOOD. PARENTS AND STUDENTS ARE REALLY CONNECTING THE DOTS THEY KNOW THAT THE FOOD STUDENTS PUT INTO THEIR BODIES IMPACTS HOW THEY FEEL. HOW THEY FOCUS AND LEARN AND THEIR LONG TERM HEALTH? SECOND SCHOOL FOOD PROGRAMS ONLY THRIVE IF THEY SERVE FOOD THAT STUDENTS ACTUALLY WANT TO EAT THAT TASTES GOOD. VACAVILLE SERVES FRESH LOCAL AND ORGANICPRODUCE WHENEVER THEY CAN. AND THEN ONCE EXPERIENCE THE STUDENTS REALLY TASTE THE DIFFERENCE HE'S CURRENTLY SERVING ABOUT 40% OF THE DISTRICT'S. STUDENTS BUT HE'S CONSTANTLY LOOKING FOR WAYS TO ATTRACT MORE STUDENTS TO THE SCHOOL MEAL PROGRAM HE THINKS THAT OFFERING ORGANIC ITEMS CAN HELP DO THAT. THE FINAL POINT ON AND MAYBE THE MOST SURPRISING HAS TO DO WITH THEFOOD THAT VENDORS OFFER TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ONE HAS FOUND THAT VENDORS OFTEN ASSUME THAT SCHOOLS AREN'T LOOKING FOR AGAIN IT FOOD SO THEY DON'T EVEN OFFER IT. BUT IN REALITY NUTRITION DIRECTORS ACROSS THE STATE ARE SEEKING OUT ORGANIC OPTIONS WHENEVER THEY CAN. AND FREQUENTLY FINDING THAT SEASONAL ORGANIC PRODUCE IS NOT THAT MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE. OUR HOPE IS THAT THIS PROGRAM WILL BEGIN TO ADDRESS ALL OF ONCE POINTS WILL BRING ORGANIC FOOD TO STUDENTS WHO ARE LEARNING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FOOD AND HEALTH. IT WILL SHOW ON STUDENTS THE HEALTHY FOOD CAN ALSO BE TASTY AND THAT SOME OF THE BEST WITH THE WORLD GROWS RIGHT IN THEIR BACKYARD. AND WILL OFFER SCHOOLS EATEN OPPORTUNITIES TALK WITH OUR VENDORS ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY POSSIBLE IN SCHOOL MEALS EVEN ON A SMALL BUDGET. SO WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE SPELL THANK YOU.

MISS RUBIO HAS -- AB ONE SIX SEVEN FIVE A MEMBER. FOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT -- ASSEMBLY BILL ONE SIXTY SEVEN AN ACT WHICH WOULD INCREASE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY CHILD CARE IN CALIFORNIA. AS CO CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND IS A FORMER CLASSROOM TEACHER EDUCATION HAS BEEN A LIFELONG PASSION OF MINE. IN CALIFORNIA TODAY ONLY 9% OF LOW INCOME INFANTS AND TODDLERS. AGES THERE ARE TWO THREE ARE ENROLLED IN SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE. EVEN IF YOU'RE FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO THE HIGH QUALITY EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS THAT HAVE THE GREATEST POSITIVE IMPACT ON LOW INCOME BABIES. IN MY DISTRICT 93% OF INFANTS AND TODDLERS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIZED CHAIR CHILD CARE ARE ON UNSERVED 93%. OUR EDUCATION IS THE BEST TOOL THAT WE HAVE TO FIGHT LONG TERM CYCLES OF POVERTY AND TO UP LIVE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT OUR GREAT STATE. THIS IS WHY I HAVE INTRODUCED ASSEMBLY BILL ONE SIXTY SEVEN LEGISLATION WILL. THE LEGISLATION WHICH WILL HELP CLOSE THE EARLY LEARNING OPPORTUNITY GAP FACING OUR YOUNGEST CHILDREN BY STRENGTHENING AND EXPANDING CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS FOR INFANTS AND TODDLERS. AS WE EXPAND OUR INVESTMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WE SHOULD ENSURE THAT OUR MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO TRULY HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO SUPPORT THEIR BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. SOCIAL SKILLS AND KINDERGARTEN READING THIS. REACH RESEARCH SHOWS THAT HIGH QUALITY EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS THAT START EARLIER IN A CHILDS LIFE MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. AS THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION'S REPORT HIGHLIGHTED WE NEED EASY PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT FAMILIES AND WE CAN BUILD ON PROVEN. UNPROVEN TO GENERATIONAL PROGRAMS THAT INCLUDE FAMILY SUPPORT SERVICES THAT HELP FAMILIES WITH THE RESOURCES AND PARENTING SKILLS THEY NEED TO HELP THEIR CHILDREN SUCCEED. AB ONE SIXTY SEVEN WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO EGGS EXISTING CHILD CARE CENTERS AND FAMILY -- CHILD CARE HOMES TO RETIRE STANDARDS BASED ON PROVEN EARLY CHILD HER START MODEL. FUNDING WOULD SUPPORT FAMILIES SUPPORT WORKERS TO HELP PARENTS HEALTH AND OF DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS BETTER TRAIN TEACHERS AND CONNECTIONS TO WELL CHILD HELLO HEALTH AND DENTAL CARE. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THIS KIND OF COMPREHENSIVE POOR CHILD THE WHOLE FAMILY APPROACH TO CHILD DEVELOPMENT DEVELOPMENT HAS THE BIGGEST IMPACT ON CHILD. CHILDREN IN POVERTY. MY BILL ALSO PROPOSES EXPANDING QUALITY FAMILY CENTERED CHILD CARE TO TWENTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL INFANTS AND TODDLERS LIVING IN HIGH NEED COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY AND WITH ME TODAY I HAVE SPONSORS FROM CONDUCTED ANGLE AND THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. GOOD AFTERNOON TURN MEMBERS MY NAME IS MICHELLE STILL A PREVENT SKI FROM CONTANGO PROUD TO CO SPONSOR AB. ONE SIXTY SEVEN A KIDDING I WAS AN EARLY LEARNING NONPROFIT IN THE LARGEST CHILD CARE PROVIDER IN THE BAY AREA. THE REASON GETTING DOWN TO FAX REPORT CONCLUDED THAT EXPANDING ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY EARLY EDUCATION IS KEY TO CLOSING CALIFORNIA'S ACHIEVEMENT GAPS FOR LOW INCOME. CHILDREN AND CHILDRENOF COLOR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT CHILDREN ARE BEHIND EVEN BEFORE THEY ENTER THEY ENTER PRESCHOOL -- BY AGE THREE CHILDREN WITH COLLEGE EDUCATED PARENTS HAVE A CALCULATOR IS THAT ARE THREE TIMES LARGER THAN CHILDREN WHO HAVE PARENTS WHO DIDN'T COMPLETE HIGH SCHOOL. FROM BIRTH TO AGE THREE A CHILD'S BRAIN DEVELOPS MORE RAPIDLY THAN DURING ANY OTHER TIME IN LIFE. WHICH MEANS THAT WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE TRAJECTORY FOR MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN. RIGAS RIGOROUS RESEARCH SHOWS THAT HIGH QUALITY FAMILY CENTERED CHILD CARE MAKES A DIFFERENCE FOR INFANTS AND TODDLERS. PROGRAMS THAT ARE HIGH QUALITY AND BEGIN IT BIRTH IMPROVE LANGUAGE AND SOCIAL SKILLS SCHOOL READINESS AND IN THE LONG TERM IMPROVE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION AND ADULT EARNINGS. UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA'S ALLOWING TOO MANY LOW INCOME BABIES TO FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS WITHOUT ACCESS TO THESE HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS. AS MENTIONED JUST 9% OF CALIFORNIA'S LOW INCOME INFANTS AND TODDLERS ARE YOU SAID ARE ENROLLED IN SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE AND EVEN FEWER ARE IN VERY HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS. AB ONE SIXTY SEVEN WILL HELP CLOSE THAT REALLY LEARNING OPPORTUNITY GAP LIFE EXPANDING ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY FAMILY CENTERED PROGRAMS THAT INCLUDE COMPREHENSIVE FAMILY SUPPORTS FOR DISADVANTAGED INFANTS AND TODDLERS. BASED ON THE PROVEN TO GENERATION EARLY HEAD START MODEL. THAT INCLUDES WELL TRAIN TEACHERS HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS FAMILY ENGAGEMENT AND HOME VISITS. THE BILL WOULD SUPPORT EXISTING A GENERAL CHILD CARE AND FAMILY CHILDCARE HOMES IN NETWORKS THAT ARE SERVING INFANTS AND TODDLERS TO MEET HIGHER QUALITY STANDARDS. PROVIDERS WOULD GET FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO REACH AND SUSTAIN THOSE HIGHER LEVELS OF QUALITY. AND THAT ARE PROVEN TO IMPROVE CHILDREN'S DEVELOPMENT -- AB ONE SIXTY SEVEN ALSO SEEKS TO EXPAND HIGH QUALITY FAMILY CENTERED CHILD CARE TO TWENTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL CHILDREN. I REGION I VOTE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON TURN MEMBERS ON JANICE GALLON I'M A CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND CALIFORNIA.

HIGH QUALITY CHILDCARE WITH COMPREHENSIVE FAMILY AND HEALTH SUPPORTS -- CRITICAL PREVENTIVE INVESTMENT TO GIVE CHILDREN A HEALTHY AND BRIGHT START. I'D LIKE TO READ A SHORT STATEMENT FROM A PARENT WHO HOPE TO BE HERE IN PERSON BUT NEEDED TO TAKE HER SON TO A MEDICAL APPOINTMENT. HELLO MY NAME IS LIZ SAID FROST -- I HAVE TWO CHILDREN WHO ARE ATTENDING COULD TANGOS CASTLE MONTH CHILD CARE CENTER IN OAKLAND. MY DAUGHTER NATALIA IS FOUR YEARS OLD AND MY SON ONE CARLOS IS TWO YEARS OLD. I WANT MORE FAMILIES TO HAVE ACCESS TO GREAT CHILD CARE LIKE WE HAVE. MY TWO CHILDREN HAVE BENEFITTED IMMENSELY FROM OF THE EARLY HEAD START PROGRAM. I ENROLLED Và THÅU YOU'RE RIGHT AWAY WHEN THE CENTER OPENED TWO YEARS AGO. BUT IT DIDN'T SERVE INFANTS SO I FOUND A HOME BASED DAYCARE FOR ONE CARLOS. HOWEVER THERE WAS AN INCIDENT. AT THE DAY CARE THAT RESULTED IN A HOSPITAL VISITS. IT SHOOK MY CONFIDENCE AND I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I COULD TRUST ANYONE ELSE WITH MY SON. SO I QUIT MY JOB TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF HIM MYSELF. THE TIDE WAS FLOURISHING ACCOUNT SOMEONE AND MAKE AND MAKING BIG STRIDES IN HER DEVELOPMENT. I ALSO DEVELOPED WONDERFUL RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE TEACHERS AND SAW FIRST HAND THE SUPPORT AND CARE THAT THEY PROVIDED EVERY CHILD. IT WAS THIS THE GAVE ME THE CARE OF ONE CARLOS. AND ROLLED HIM WHEN HE WAS SEVENTEEN MONTHS OLD AND I WAS ABLE TO GO BACK TO WORK. THE SUPPORT OFFERED BY TEACHERS AND FAMILY ADVOCATES HAS BEEN AMAZING BOTH IN TERMS OF HELPING MY CHILDREN DEVELOP. AND IN PROVIDING ME WITH THE SKILLS AND RESOURCES TO SUPPORT MY KIDS INCLUDING HELP WITH PLACES TO LIVE. BOTH OF MY KIDS HAVE HAD HELP WITH SPEECH DELAYS. THE TEACHERS ALSO HELP ME WITH TIPS.

FOR YOU SEE IN CALIFORNIA FROM BIRTH THROUGH.

FOR ADDITIONAL CARE CHILD CARE -- AND SUPPORT FOR INFANTS TO TODDLERS -- I LIKES SO MANY OTHERS WOULD REALLY WOULD LOVE TO US TO HAVE A VERY COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM RATHER THAN A LOT OF PIECES COMING IN AT ONCE BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN WE DO THE PIECES.

HOWEVER THAT ALL OF THOSE VARIOUS BILLS THAT EXIST FOR PRESCHOOL AND CHILDCARE INFANT CARE IN THE GOVERNOR'S PIECE OF THE PEACE THEY WANT IN THE BUDGET AND ALL THESE THINGS.

THE BUS FIVE VOTES IT IS OUT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AB ELEVEN SEVENTY GAP WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. THE MISSION OF THE CENTERS TO ELIMINATE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT GAPS BETWEEN SUBGROUPS OF STUDENTS AND NEW KINDERGARTEN THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE BY. ONE PROVIDING PRE SERVICE PREPARATION OF EDUCATORS IN THE CSU SYSTEM. ON EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTIONAL AND SCHOOL LEADERSHIP PRACTICES IN THE USE OF DATA. TO SERVING AS A RESOURCE FOR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. ON ON STRATEGIES FOR CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS INCLUDING SERVING AS A CLEARING HOUSE FOR EVIDENCE BASED STRATEGIES AND PROMISING PRACTICES FOR CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. ALSO IT -- IF THE CHIPPING GAP IS A IS A SIGNIFICANT AND PERSISTENT DISPARITY IN STUDENT PERFORMANCE AND EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT BETWEEN STUDENT GROUPS WE KNOW THIS THIS IS CALIFORNIA'S. BIGGEST CHALLENGE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. THE GAP BETWEEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL FOR BOTH BLACK. FOR FOR BOTH BLACK AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO STUDENTS AS WOLF IS FOR STUDENTS WITH A DISABILITY AND FOSTER YOUTH BY FOURTH GRADE. WHITE AND ASIAN STUDENTS CALIFORNIA. A SCORE ABOVE STATE AVERAGE IS FOR MATH WELL BLACK AND LATINO STUDENTS FALL BELOW THOSE AVERAGES WE KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW THE DATA YOU SEE IT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON OUR STATE. CURRENT LAW HAS ESTABLISHED A SYSTEM OF POLICY MAKING DATA COLLECTION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN PRACTICE. WITH THERE'S NO ENTITY TASKED WITH SUPPORTING UNDERGRADUATE. AND PRE SERVICE PREPARATION OF EDUCATION. OF EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND ALTHOUGH THE AT THE CHEAPER GAP AS WIDELY STUDIED NATIONALLY AND STATE WIDE. IN FACT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE UC STUDYING IT AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT RESEARCH ALWAYS GOES THE FACT IS WE NEED A ONE STOP SHOP IN THE STATE WHERE WE CAN HOUSES INFORMATION. THE BEST PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND WE CAN PUSH THAT INFORMATION OUT TO RATHER UNIVERSITIES SO WHY THE CSU. IT THIS ISSUE BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY IT PRODUCES. THE MOST TEACHING CREDENTIALS IN FACT REALLY TO THE C. ISSUES PRODUCED MOST OF THE TEACHING CREDENTIALS SO THAT'S A NATURAL PLACE FOR FOR CENTER SUCH AS THIS. I THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING -- AND AGAIN I I THINK IT'S IT'S THAT ONE STOP SHOP THAT WE NEED AYE HERE I'LL GET UCLA COME AND LOOK WHAT WE DID. AND WHAT I WANT TO NOTE FROM A VERY YOU SEE WHEN THEY COME IN AS WELL I WANNA SEE WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE INFORMATION WE WERE THEY ABLE TO USE IT IN A CLASSROOM. DID THEY TEACH IT IN A PRE SERVICE PROGRAM AND I DON'T HEAR THAT IT'S REALLY HAPPENING SO AGAIN WE NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUT AT THAT LEVEL CREATE SUCH AS CENTER AND MOVE CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN. FOR OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. NICK ROMAN ON BEHALF OF THE WESTERN ASSOCIATION FOR COLLEGE ADMISSIONS COUNSELING IN SUPPORT. WHEN THIS IS IN OPPOSITION? RUNNING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS DOCTOR WEBER -- AS YOU POINTED THEIR WHOLE BUNCH OF SENATE FLOAT AROUND HERE -- HAVE YOU MAY CONTACT WITH THAT ONE IN BERKELEY THAT THE FOSTER CENTER. I HAVE NOT OKAY BECAUSE THAT'S FOCUSED ON CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND THEY ARE. I JUST MET WITH THE DEAN THE OTHER DAY AND SO THEY HAVE SOME REALLY -- THEY'VE GOT A PC PROGRAMS ONE SOME RESEARCH GOING AND THEY POSTED THE FOSTER INSTITUTE WORKS WITH THE SCHOOLS IT WAS NAMED AFTER THE SUPERINTENDENT WHO WAS KILLED BY THE SYMBIONESE LIBERATION ARMY FOLKS SO -- WE JUST MET WITH HIM THE OTHER DAY AND THEY'RE AND THEY'RE DOING SOME OF THIS WORK SO I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD. TOO AS A PART OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND I GUESS YOU'RE GIVING IT TO THE THE CHANCE TO SEE ISSUE PERSON -- TO ALSO LOOK INTO IT BUT I THINK THE UC CAMPUS HAVE SOME OUR PROBLEM -- AS ALWAYS IS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY AND THE COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF WHETHER NOT WHAT THEY DO ACTUALLY SHARE IT WITH THE COMMUNITIES THAT WOULD TAKE IT. SO I I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA I THINK THERE'S SOME THAT ARE ALREADY IN EXISTENCE THIS DOESN'T PARALLEL WITH I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DID WITH THE L. CFF WE STARTED UP. A PERSON WHO'S SUPPOSED TO BE IN CHARGE OF WAS CONE AT ONE POINT IS THAT STILL IN EXISTENCE. THAT'S THAT'S GOOD STAFF RIGHT THERE I GOT. DOES IT ALL THE TIME OKAY I MIGHT BE ABLE TO THIS ONE OF MY OWN THOUGH YEAH. ONE OF HER BETTER MOMENTS RIGHT THERE -- BUT I YES THAT IS IN EXISTENCE AND I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THAT ENTITY IS DOING YES. I REALLY DO -- BECAUSE OF WHAT I'VE I THINK WHAT I'M REALLY GETTING AT IS WERE OPERATING IN SILOS. IN MANY PLACES EVEN THIS BERKELEY THIS IS A THAT'S THE BERKELEY THE SAME HAND AGAIN I DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT. RIGHT SO -- BUT I DO KNOW THE LIKE THE UC'S ARE DOING A LOT OF RESEARCH FOR THE ARE PRODUCING A LOT OF TEACHER CREDENTIAL CANDIDATES RIGHT THAT'S REALLY DONE AT THE CSU LEVEL BY MARCH. AND THAT'S WHAT I MEAN I I I WANT TO TAKE THAT RESEARCH I WANNA USE THAT RESEARCH I WANT TO USE THE KNOWLEDGE OF ALL AND HE'S AND PUT IT ONE PLACE SO IT'S HOUSE. AND WE CAN IDENTIFY THE BEST PRACTICES CERTAINLY INFUSE IT IN OUR TEACHER CREDENTIALING PROGRAMS BUT ALSO GET IT INTO OUR SCHOOLS AS WELL AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE DO THIS BECAUSE I I GET A LOT OF PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR TO LOOK AT WE'RE DOING WHAT. WE'RE DOING WITH. I I CAN'T BE THE THE GUY THAT HOUSES THIS WE NEED A PLACE IN THIS STATE WORDS HOUSE AND WE CAN FIGURE OUT SOME PROTOCOLS TO PUSH IT OUT. AND I THINK WE HAVE A CAUGHT HAVE OUGHT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE C. C. E. OR WHATEVER WE CALL IT -- BECAUSE THEY NOW MOVED -- WRITING THIS AND ALMOST STATE. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THE TEACHER CREDENTIAL CANDIDATES THEY'RE PRODUCING THERE BUT QUITE FRANKLY. THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP BY LARGE NOT ALWAYS IS ASSOCIATED WITH WITH LOW INCOME STUDENTS ENGLISH LEARNERS AND AND CERTAINLY SOME OTHER FACTORS. IN A NEEDS TO BE IN THOSE AREAS. WHERE THERE ISN'T URBAN SCHOOL TRANSFORMATION CENTER AT SAN DIEGO STATE WITH DR JILL JOHNSON -- AND IT IS OF OF RESEARCH INSTITUTE AS WELL AS THE FACULTY DEVELOPMENT IS TEACHER TRAINING PROGRAM -- SO THEIR THEIR NUMBER OF THEM OUT THERE I I'M NOT SURE WHETHER -- DOING ANOTHER ONE IS IS ANY WE CAN TRY IT AND SEE OVER THE IF YOU GIVE THIS TO THE CHANCELLOR THEY WILL LOOK TO SEE WHAT'S IN THEIR SYSTEM AND TRY TO COORDINATE THAT BETTER. BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE OF AND THE SOME OF THE GREAT WORK AND SOME OF THEM DO A LOT OF RESEARCH WORK WOULD NEVER RELATE TO CAMPUSES OUR SCHOOLS. URBAN SCHOOL TRANSFORMATION RELATES TO SCHOOLS AND THEY WORK WITH SEVERAL SCHOOLS ACTUALLY AND HAVE BASICALLY DEMONSTRATE THOSE SCHOOLS CAN IMPROVE IN SAN DIEGO SO IT'S SO THEIR NUMBER BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THOUGH THAT THAT WHATEVER THEY'RE DOING IS IS PUT TO A HIGHER LEVEL SO THAT WE CAN. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT AND UTILIZE IT AS WELL AS OTHER FOLKS UP AND DOWN THE STATE AND MAYBE IT'S ISSUE FUNDING OR WHATEVER MAY BE BUT I THINK. BREAKING IT TO THE TO THE C. ISSUE WHAT WOULD THIS DOES MOST OF THE THE CREDENTIALING OF THE STATE OF WOULD BE GOOD SO I I SUPPORT THIS I JUST HOPE THAT WE PAY ATTENTION TO SOME OF THE ONES THAT ARE OUT THERE IN THIS AND THE CHANCELLOR SHOULD. KNOW THEM I MEAN THEY YOU I ASSUME THEY SHOULD KNOW WHO'S ON THEIR CAMPUSES TO WHICH THESE MAJOR RESEARCH INSTITUTES YEAH. ADDED BY I GUESS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE -- AGAIN I'M INTO THE ONE STOP SHOP RIGHT -- AND THAT DOES MEAN FOR RESEARCH THAT JUST MEANS HOUSING IT AND THE BEST PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH A VARIETY OF THINGS GOING ON IN THE CLASSROOM. AND AND AND I EVEN MY OWN ROLE HERE SOMETIMES I I STRUGGLE WITH THIS PLACE OVER HERE THIS PLACE OVER HERE AND THEY'RE ALL DOING. PROBABLY GREAT STUFF BUT I DON'T THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT WHAT EACH OTHER'S DOING SOME SEEKING SOME COMMUNICATION YEAH WELL I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT THE LC AFFECTING WAS GOING TO DO BUT AT I HAVEN'T SEEN LET ME ANYBODY SHOW UP FOR THAT. YEAH I I I I I A DINNER WILL BE BLUNT WITH YOU WITH THE CENTER THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT I CAN TELL YOU THE FULL NAME OF I CAN'T EVEN. CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION EASY SOMETHING -- I THINK THE FACT THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS A REAL PROBLEM. THE FACT THAT WERE FUNDING THEM AND DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS A REAL PROBLEM. AND I THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO FIX AND SO I THINK WE'LL DO THAT TOGETHER OKAY SOUNDS GOOD.

THESE PROGRAMS ARE OFTEN ESSENTIAL FOR WORKING PARENTS WHO WORK TIRELESSLY TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR CHILDREN BUT OFTEN CANNOT AFFORD AFTER SCHOOL CHILD CARE. HOWEVER OVER TIME COST TO OPERATE THESE PROGRAMS HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. SINCE ACES WAS IMPLEMENTED THE CALIFORNIA MAN MINIMUM WAGE HAS INCREASED BY 50%. AND THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX HAS INCREASED BY 30% WHILE THE DAILY REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR ASUS HAS ONLY INCREASED BY 9% AS A RESULT THESE PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE FREQUENTLY STRUGGLE TO STAY OPEN. ACCORDING TO THE SURVEY REPRESENTING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITHOUT A FUNDING REQUEST ONE IN FOUR PROGRAMS. EXPECT TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS TO ABOUT NINETY WANTS TO NINETY ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS BY. TWENTY TWENTY AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY FIVE PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED AND TWELVE POINT EIGHT MILLION AND CONTINUOUS FUNDING. OUT TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FOR THESE CRITICAL AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AS BRINGING THE FUNDING FORMULA FROM EIGHT DOLLARS AND NINETEEN CENTS TO NINE DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS. PER STUDENT EVERY DAY WHICH TO BE QUITE HONEST IT'S NOT EVEN QUITE ENOUGH. AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY FIVE WILL ALLOW ASUS. FUNDING TO GROW WITH FUTURE MINIMUM WAGE AND COST OF LIVING INCREASES TO CONTINUE SERVING CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. AND THEIR FAMILIES AND I WILL ALLOW MY WITNESSES TO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES THANK YOU. GET AFTERNOON MY NAME IS WENDY AGREES AND I'M PROUD TO BE HERE TODAY AS A PRODUCT OF AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. I GREW UP IN THE MOST DANGEROUS ONE MILE RADIUS IN LOS ANGELES IN THE NINETIES. WITH MY MOTHER HAVING PASSED AND MY FATHER BEING AT WORK MY SIBLINGS AND I WERE LEFT ALONE. WALKING TO SCHOOL OR WALKING HOME MEANT TAKING MY LIFE IN MY HANDS. AT THE TIME LITTLE HANDS AT THE MERCY OF RANGING GANG VIOLENCE. DURING MY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AGE FUNERALS WERE REGULAR FUNCTION. THROUGH ALLEYS BEST AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM I LEARNED REAL REAL WORLD SKILLS. THIS NOT BE TAUGHT ME TO MAKING COOKING CLASS BECAME THE DINNER I MADE FOR MY SIBLINGS AT NIGHT. WHAT KIDS MY AGE WERE LEFT TO HANG OUT AND BECOME ENTRENCHED UNLAWFUL ACTIVITY OR BECOME THE VICTIMS OF IT? I WAS AT LA'S BEST IN MY AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM. THIS IS WHY AFTER SCHOOL MEANS SO MUCH TO ME. I WAS ENCOURAGED AND I WAS BELIEVED IN. THE INTRODUCED ME TO A WORLD I NEVER KNEW. MY AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM TAUGHT ME TO BE RESILIENT AND I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL FOR THE QUALITY OF THE LIFE I LIVE BECAUSE OF THIS. I AM NOW PARENTS. AND I DEPEND ON MY AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM FOR MY DAUGHTER'S. MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH NEED TO WORK FULL TIME TO MAKE A LIVING. AND TO PROVIDE FOR THEM. WE DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF PICKING THEM UP RIGHT AFTER SCHOOL. WHILE WE WORK. WE KNOW OUR CHILDREN ARE SAFE AND THEY'RE LEARNING IN THE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM. BUT AFTER SCHOOL GOES BEYOND JUST HEALTHCARE. MY DAUGHTERS ARE THRIVING. AS THEY PARTICIPATE IN SCIENCE CLUB SOFTBALL DANCE DRILL AND SO MUCH MORE. THESE ACTIVITIES TEACH THEM IMPORTANT SKILLS. BUILD THEIR CONFIDENCE. AND GIVE THEM ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITIES THEY OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE. AS AN ALUMNI AND AS A PARENT. I CAN ATTEST TO AFTER SCHOOL IS NOT SOMETHING EXTRA. IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL NEEDED ALL CHILDREN SHOULD HAVE ACCESS. TO I WOULD NOT BE HERE IF NOT FROM AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM. PLEASE FULFILL CALIFORNIA'S PROMISE TO OUR CHILDREN. BY MAKING SURE THAT OTHER CHILDREN HAVE THAT SAME OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU. CHEN D. CHECK FROM THE PARTNERSHIP FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AFTER SCHOOL ADVOCACY ALLIANCE. REPRESENT IT'S A COLD STATEWIDE COALITION REPRESENTING THE INTERESTS OF THE HALF A MILLION CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. SERVED BY A PUBLICLY FUNDED AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA EVERY DAY WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN TWELVE TO SAVE THE STATE'S HIGH QUALITY AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS THESE PROGRAMS. IMPROVE SCHOOL ATTENDANCE REDUCE DROPOUT RATES HELP ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS TRANSITION TO PROFICIENCY BUILD SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SKILLS. PROMOTE CAREER EXPLORATION ALL WHILE THEY'RE ALSO REDUCING CRIME SERVING NUTRITIOUS MEALS AND PROVIDING CRITICAL CHILD CARE FOR CHILDREN. AS YOUNG AS FIVE YEARS OLD FOR WORKING PARENTS. BUT WITHOUT SAID AB. SEVENTEEN TWELVE I'M SORRY SEVENTEEN TWENTY FIVE CALIFORNIA'S SYSTEM OF AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS WILL IMMEDIATELY BEGIN TO COLLAPSE. EACH TIME THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM THE STATE ASUS PROGRAM SINK DEEPER INTO DEFICIT. TODAY PROGRAMS ARE STRETCHED TO THE BREAKING POINT AND ARE BRACING FOR ANOTHER MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE IN JANUARY. AS AN EXAMPLE LA'S BEST AFTER SCHOOL ENRICHMENT PROGRAM THE PROGRAM THAT SUPPORTED MISS REESE. WHEN SHE WAS GROWING UP AND NOW SUPPORTS OUR CHILDREN WELL WITHOUT ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING THEY SHEER LA'S BEST PLANS TO CUT OUR PROGRAMS FOR SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS? AND SPORTS PROGRAMS FOR TWELVE THOUSAND THEY WILL ALSO HAVE TO REDUCE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR NEW STAFF. GOING FROM THIRTY HOURS TO TEN HOURS WHICH IS VITAL TO STUDENT SUCCESS AND WELL BEING. THESE KINDS OF CUTS ARE HAPPENING ALREADY. AND BE A NEXT YEAR PROGRAMS ARE AT RISK OF SHUTTING DOWN ACROSS THE STATE AT URBAN AND RURAL SCHOOLS A LIGHT. AND THE IMPACT OF THESE CUTS AN IMPENDING CLOSURES FALL ON OUR STUDENTS MOST OF WHOM QUALIFY FOR FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS AND AT MISS RUIZ'S PROGRAM NEARLY 90% UALIFY. CHILDREN NEED AND DESERVE THE EXPERIENCES AND SUPPORT ESSENTIAL FOR THEIR FUTURE REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE OR THEIR FAMILY'S INCOME. AND UNLESS THE STATE TAKES ACTION THESE STUDENTS WILL LOSE THEIR HUNDREDS OF ADDITIONAL LEARNING HOURS THAT HELP CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT AN OPPORTUNITY. GAP THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.
