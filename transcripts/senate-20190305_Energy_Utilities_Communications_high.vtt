ELEVEN I'M CHAPTER ELEVEN IS A

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:43.669
STATUTES OF BANKRUPTCY LAW.

00:11:43.736 --> 00:11:44.970
AT A HIGH LEVEL WHEN A FIRM

00:11:45.037 --> 00:11:46.739

BUSINESS THAT IS GENERALLY A

00:11:49.775 --> 00:11:51.077
GOOD BUSINESS THAT IS PRODUCING

00:11:51.143 --> 00:11:54.013
PROFIT PERHAPS TOO LITTLE PROFIT

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.347
TO PAY FOR THE DEBTS ON THAT

00:11:55.414 --> 00:11:57.049
THEY BORROWED IN THE PAST.

00:11:57.116 --> 00:11:58.918
ON TO CHAPTER ELEVEN PROVIDES A

00:11:58.984 --> 00:12:01.754
FIRM LIKE SOME OF THE DEATHS

00:12:01.821 --> 00:12:03.756
THAT THEY BORROWED --

00:12:03.823 --> 00:12:05.191
INTO PROTECT CREDITORS WHILE THE

00:12:05.257 --> 00:12:06.926
SAME TIME GETTING RID OF UNDER

00:12:06.992 --> 00:12:09.228
PERFORMING ASSETS AND I'M

00:12:09.295 --> 00:12:11.063
SHUTTING BAD CONTRACTS.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.765
IN SOME CASES FIRMS COULD

00:12:12.832 --> 00:12:14.266
INSTEAD APPLY FOR WHAT WE CALL A

00:12:14.333 --> 00:12:17.002
CHAPTER SEVEN LIQUIDATION IN A

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:17.837
CHAPTER SEVEN A FIRM IS

00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:18.838
GENERALLY THROWING UP HIS HANDS

AND SAYING WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT

00:12:20.806 --> 00:12:22.475
HOW TO USE WHATEVER ASSETS WE

00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:23.876
HAVE IN A PROFITABLE WAY.

00:12:23.943 --> 00:12:24.977
WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE THE

00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:26.745
EQUIVALENT OF A GARAGE SALE

00:12:26.812 --> 00:12:28.013
THAT'S NOT WHAT P. GENIES AT P.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.182
JEANNIE FILED FOR CHAPTER ELEVEN

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:32.184
BANKRUPTCY ON IN GENERAL

00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:33.285
BANKRUPTCY LAW HAS BECOME SO

00:12:33.352 --> 00:12:35.221
SOPHISTICATED IN BANKRUPTCY

00:12:35.287 --> 00:12:37.690
PROFESSIONAL SO SOPHISTICATED --

00:12:37.756 --> 00:12:38.657
THAT FOR THE MOST PART ON

00:12:38.724 --> 00:12:40.726
CONSUMERS AND CREDITORS OF P.

00:12:40.793 --> 00:12:41.961
JEANNIE WHO DO BUSINESS WITH P.

00:12:42.027 --> 00:12:43.362
JEANNIE AS PART OF THEIR DAY TO

00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:46.031
DAY OPERATIONS WON'T EVEN NOTICE

00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:47.600
THE DIFFERENCE --

00:12:47.666 --> 00:12:48.834
NEXT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

00:12:48.901 --> 00:12:50.269
USEFUL TO SUMMARIZE Y. P. GENIE

00:12:50.336 --> 00:12:53.239
IS BETTER OFF BECAUSE THEY FOUND

00:12:53.305 --> 00:12:54.406

00:12:54.473 --> 00:12:55.508
FIRST P. JEANNIE HAS ABOUT

00:12:55.574 --> 00:12:56.509
TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN BANK

00:12:56.575 --> 00:12:58.310
THAT AND MOST THE BOND ACT WELL

00:12:58.377 --> 00:12:59.211
THIS SOUNDS LIKE A LOT IT

00:12:59.278 --> 00:13:00.613
ACTUALLY ISN'T IN THE GRAND

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:02.014
SCHEME OF P. JEANNIE BECAUSE P.

00:13:02.081 --> 00:13:03.883
GENIE IS SO MASSIVE.

00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:05.518
AND CREATES SO MUCH REVENUE ON

00:13:05.584 --> 00:13:06.986
THIS MEANS P. JEANNIE HAS A VERY

00:13:07.052 --> 00:13:08.053
DIFFERENT PROFILE THAN YOUR

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.488
AVERAGE CHAPTER ELEVEN CORPORATE

PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO BUY IN

00:13:16.695 --> 00:13:17.930
NEEDED TO FIX THAT --

00:13:17.997 --> 00:13:19.632
P. GENIES CORE PRODUCT YOU KNOW

00:13:19.698 --> 00:13:21.634
IT HAS DEMANDED CUSTOMERS WHO

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.469

RELATED TO THOSE TWO CASES THISLITIGATION IS INCREDIBLY

00:13:47.193 --> 00:13:49.128
COMPLICATED IN A CERTAIN TO DRAW

IN A WHILE IS OTHER GOVERNMENTAL

00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:53.832
ENTITIES --

00:13:53.899 --> 00:13:55.467
THE BENEFIT TO P. GENIE IS THAT

00:13:55.534 --> 00:13:56.969
BANKRUPTCY LAW PROVIDES FOR AN

00:13:57.036 --> 00:13:58.871
AUTOMATIC STAY OF THIS

00:13:58.938 --> 00:14:00.706
LITIGATION THE AUTOMATIC STAY OF

CREATED BY FEDERAL LAW SO

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:17.256

YOU COULD SEE A JUDGE INSIDE

00:14:25.164 --> 00:14:27.032
BANKRUPTCY THE PROCESS IS VERY

BANKRUPTCY JUDGE IN AN HOUR --

00:14:48.287 --> 00:14:49.955
THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

00:14:50.022 --> 00:14:50.789
BANKRUPTCY LAW IS OFTEN A

00:14:50.856 --> 00:14:52.791
SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF

00:14:52.858 --> 00:14:54.793
DEBTORS WHO HAVE LOTS OF TORT

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:55.594
CLAIMS OUT THERE THEY'RE BEING

00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:57.429
SUED BY LOTS F PEOPLE THEY GET

00:14:57.496 --> 00:14:59.265
A MORE EFFICIENT ADMINISTRATIVE

00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:00.666
PROCEDURE --

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:02.568
THE SECOND BENEFIT OF CHAPTER

00:15:02.635 --> 00:15:03.969
ELEVEN FOR P. GENIE IS THE

00:15:04.036 --> 00:15:05.838
ABILITY TO GET NEW FINANCING --

00:15:05.904 --> 00:15:07.072
AS THE CHAIRMAN MENTIONED IN HIS

00:15:07.139 --> 00:15:09.008
INTRODUCTORY REMARKS THE ACCESS

00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:10.509
TO CAPITAL MARKETS IS KEY FOR AN

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:11.877
ENERGY COMPANY --

00:15:11.944 --> 00:15:13.245
GIVEN P. GENIES LIABILITY

00:15:13.312 --> 00:15:14.980
SITUATION WHERE THEY HAVE SEEM

00:15:15.047 --> 00:15:17.016
TO HAVE ALL OF THIS UNKNOWN ON

00:15:17.082 --> 00:15:19.018
ESTIMATED ON LIQUIDATED TORT

00:15:19.084 --> 00:15:20.119
LIABILITY ON IN MAY HAVE BEEN

00:15:20.185 --> 00:15:21.487
DIFFICULT FOR PEACE YOU NEED TO

00:15:21.553 --> 00:15:23.022
BORROW ADDITIONAL MONEY.

00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:26.058
OUTSIDE OF BANKRUPTCY ON A

00:15:26.125 --> 00:15:30.596
FAVORABLE GIVE NEW IN THE FORMAL

00:15:30.663 --> 00:15:31.230
WE CALL A DEBTOR IN POSSESSION

00:15:31.297 --> 00:15:33.932
LOAN ON A SUPER SENIOR CLAIM SO

00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:35.467
A GROUP OF BANKS WHICH IS

00:15:35.534 --> 00:15:37.036
CURRENTLY NOW PROMISING TO LAND

00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:38.904
A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO P.

00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:39.305
JEANNIE --

00:15:39.371 --> 00:15:40.739
CAN REST ASSURED THAT THEY'LL BE

00:15:40.806 --> 00:15:42.608
PAID IN FULL ONCE THE BANKRUPTCY

00:15:42.675 --> 00:15:43.976
JUDGE APPROVED THE BORROWING

00:15:44.043 --> 00:15:46.111
WHICH IS ALREADY BEEN APPROVED --

00:15:46.178 --> 00:15:47.446
BY THE CPUC.

00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:48.447
SO THERE COUPLE OF NOTEWORTHY

00:15:48.514 --> 00:15:50.282
THINGS ABOUT THE FIVE POINT FIVE

00:15:50.349 --> 00:15:51.950
BILLION DOLLAR DIP LOAN THAT I

00:15:52.017 --> 00:15:52.885
THOUGHT ARE WORTH EMPHASIZING

00:15:52.951 --> 00:15:55.521
BECAUSE THEY POINT TO WHERE THIS

00:15:55.587 --> 00:15:56.722
BANKRUPTCY PROCESS IS GOING

00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:57.022
[inaudible]

00:15:57.089 --> 00:15:58.824
ON FIRST.

00:15:58.891 --> 00:16:01.560
THE SHEER SIZE OF THIS OUT OF

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:02.895
THE LOAN THE BANKS ARE WILLING

00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:04.229
TO GIVE THE P. JEANNIE FIVE

00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:05.631
POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IS

00:16:05.698 --> 00:16:07.933
UNUSUAL THIS IS AN UNUSUALLY

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.335
LARGE DIP LOAN --

00:16:09.401 --> 00:16:10.602
AND WITH THIS REFLECTS I THINK

00:16:10.669 --> 00:16:11.637
IS THE INVESTOR COMMUNITIES

00:16:11.704 --> 00:16:14.173
CONFIDENCE ON THE P. JEANNIE HAS

00:16:14.239 --> 00:16:15.941
A BRIGHT FUTURE ONCE THEY FIGURE

00:16:16.008 --> 00:16:17.443
OUT WHAT TO DO --

00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:19.111
WITH THE LIABILITY SITUATION

00:16:19.178 --> 00:16:20.546
THEY HAD IN THE PAST AS WELL AS

00:16:20.612 --> 00:16:22.281
THE LIABILITY SITUATION THEY

00:16:22.348 --> 00:16:24.817
HAVE GOING FORWARD --

00:16:24.883 --> 00:16:26.785
ALSO BECAUSE IT'S A LOT OF MONEY

00:16:26.852 --> 00:16:28.020
ON IT REFLECTS THE INVESTOR

00:16:28.087 --> 00:16:29.722
COMMUNITIES VIEW PERHAPS THE P.

00:16:29.788 --> 00:16:31.457
JEANNIE MIGHT BE IN BANKRUPTCY

00:16:31.523 --> 00:16:32.958
FOR QUITE A WHILE.

00:16:33.025 --> 00:16:35.594
ON THE DIPLOMA ISN'T TO DO THAT

00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:36.395
THAT ONE IS THAT IS BEING LUNCH

00:16:36.462 --> 00:16:38.197
THE P. JEANNIE UNTIL DECEMBER

00:16:38.263 --> 00:16:39.531
THIRTY FIRST.

00:16:39.598 --> 00:16:40.733
TWENTY TWENTY I'M P. JEANNIE HAS

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:42.301
THE OPTION TO EXTEND IT FOR A

00:16:42.368 --> 00:16:44.770
THIRD YEAR IF THEY WANTED TO

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:47.773
DECEMBER THIRTIETH. TWENTY

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.407
TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT'S

00:16:48.474 --> 00:16:49.942
A VERY LONG TIME IN THE

00:16:50.008 --> 00:16:51.577
BANKRUPTCY WORLD --

00:16:51.643 --> 00:16:53.011
THE MEDIAN PUBLIC COMPANY TO

00:16:53.078 --> 00:16:54.680
FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY BETWEEN AND

00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:56.215
I'M SERVICE TWENTY ON ITS DUE

00:16:56.281 --> 00:16:57.883
DECEMBER THIRTY ONE TWENTY

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.218
TWENTY ONE AND CAN BE EXTENDED

00:16:59.284 --> 00:16:59.752
THE TWENTY TWENTY TAIL.

00:16:59.818 --> 00:17:01.487
ON THAT THE MEDIAN PUBLIC

00:17:01.553 --> 00:17:02.421
COMPANY TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY

00:17:02.488 --> 00:17:04.757
BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND

00:17:04.823 --> 00:17:05.924
TWENTY EIGHTEEN NEEDED ABOUT

00:17:05.991 --> 00:17:07.359
FIVE MONTHS TO REORGANIZE IN THE

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:08.560
FACT THAT THE INVESTOR COMMUNITY

00:17:08.627 --> 00:17:10.462
IS THINKING A MULTI YEAR

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:11.063
BANKRUPTCY PROCESS.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:15.868
POINTS TO HOW COMPLICATED THE

00:17:15.934 --> 00:17:17.002
REASON WHY P. JEANNIE CAN

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:18.237
BENEFIT FROM BANKRUPTCY IS THE

00:17:18.303 --> 00:17:19.505
OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT OF

00:17:19.571 --> 00:17:21.874
UNPROFITABLE CONTRACTS AND TO

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.308
SHED UNDERPERFORMING ASSETS I'M

00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:25.210
A DEBTOR CHAPTER ELEVEN HAS THE

00:17:25.277 --> 00:17:26.945
POWER TO TEAR UP CONTRACTS WHEN

00:17:27.012 --> 00:17:28.714
IT MAKES BUSINESS SENSE TO DO SO.

00:17:28.781 --> 00:17:30.282
ON THE COUNTER PARTY THAT TO

00:17:30.349 --> 00:17:31.984
THAT CONTRACT MIGHT OBJECT IN BE

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:33.452
UPSET -- BUT

00:17:33.519 --> 00:17:34.119
OUT -- BUT

00:17:34.186 --> 00:17:35.587
IN MOST CASES THEIR ONLY

00:17:35.654 --> 00:17:37.356
ENTITLED TO A CLAIM FOR DAMAGES

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:39.091
AND THE CLAIM FOR DAMAGES MIGHT

00:17:39.158 --> 00:17:40.759
NOT END UP WORTH VERY MUCH THERE

00:17:40.826 --> 00:17:42.227
ARE CERTAIN COMPLICATIONS HERE

00:17:42.294 --> 00:17:43.962
BECAUSE P. GENIE IS PARTY. TO

00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.963
THESE POWER PURCHASING

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:45.731
AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE THIS

00:17:45.798 --> 00:17:48.100
FEDERAL REGULATORY OVERLAY --

00:17:48.167 --> 00:17:49.468
IN THEIR LOT OF ON QUESTION ON

00:17:49.535 --> 00:17:51.036
ON ANSWER QUESTIONS OF LOS

00:17:51.103 --> 00:17:52.905
SURROUNDING THAT SO P. JEANNIE

00:17:52.971 --> 00:17:54.239
MIGHT HAVE LESS AUTONOMY TO

00:17:54.306 --> 00:17:56.275
TERRA BAD CONTRACTS THAN MOST

00:17:56.341 --> 00:17:57.409
COMPANIES STILL ON BUT IN

00:17:57.476 --> 00:17:59.044
GENERAL THIS IS ONE OF THE

00:17:59.111 --> 00:17:59.912
REASONS WHY COMPANIES FILE FOR

00:17:59.978 --> 00:18:01.213
BANKRUPTCY --

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.949
FINALLY MANY COMPANIES USE

00:18:04.016 --> 00:18:04.616
CHAPTER ELEVEN TO IMPROVE THEIR

00:18:04.683 --> 00:18:06.618
GOVERNANCE P. JEANNIE SEEMS TO

00:18:06.685 --> 00:18:08.153
BE NO EXCEPTION WITH P. JEANNIE

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.521
INDICATING THAT HALF THE BOARD

00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:10.556
WILL BE REPLACED.

00:18:10.622 --> 00:18:12.157
VERY SOON AND DIFFERENT

00:18:12.224 --> 00:18:14.026
INVESTORS NOW ADVOCATING TO PUT

00:18:14.092 --> 00:18:15.627
THEIR OWN DIRECTORS ON THE BOARD

00:18:15.694 --> 00:18:16.929
AND THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY I

00:18:16.995 --> 00:18:18.230
THINK FOR P. JEANNIE TO LOOK

00:18:18.297 --> 00:18:19.865
LIKE A DIFFERENT COMPANY IN THE

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:21.667
NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE --

00:18:21.733 --> 00:18:22.534
BE BEFORE I SPEAK TO SAID

00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:23.368
BUCKLEY ON HOW THE P. JEANNIE

00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:25.170
BANKRUPTCY PROCESS IS LIKELY TO

00:18:25.237 --> 00:18:26.972
PLAY OUT I WANTED TO POINT OUT A

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:29.942
COUPLE OF BASIC THINGS ABOUT HOW

00:18:30.008 --> 00:18:31.410
BANKRUPTCY LAW WORKS --

00:18:31.477 --> 00:18:33.245
FIRST A CREDITOR IN BANKRUPTCY

00:18:33.312 --> 00:18:34.913
HAS A CLAIM THAT A SUBJECT TO

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.748
WHAT WE CALL DISCHARGE THIS

00:18:36.815 --> 00:18:38.050
MEANS THAT THE CREDITORS CLAIM

00:18:38.116 --> 00:18:39.451
WILL BE CANCELED AT THE END OF

00:18:39.518 --> 00:18:40.719
THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS.

00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:41.987
THE LAW PROVIDES THAT THE

00:18:42.054 --> 00:18:43.322
CREDITORS WILL RECEIVE THE SHARE

00:18:43.388 --> 00:18:44.623
OF THE DEBTOR'S ASSETS THAT

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:45.924
THEY'RE ENTITLED TO TO THE

00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:47.025
EXTENT THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH

00:18:47.092 --> 00:18:49.862
ASSETS TO SATISFY CREDITORS --

00:18:49.928 --> 00:18:51.129
CREDITORS CAN BE FORCED TO

00:18:51.196 --> 00:18:53.165
ACCEPT A PARTIAL PAYMENT THAT

00:18:53.232 --> 00:18:55.100
DOES NOT PAY THEM IN FULL --

00:18:55.167 --> 00:18:57.970
SECOND TO HEAR FOR THE MOST PART

00:18:58.036 --> 00:18:59.004
WILD FIRE VICTIMS AND BOND

00:18:59.071 --> 00:19:00.672
HOLDERS ARE IN THE SAME BOAT

00:19:00.739 --> 00:19:02.608
THEY HAVE CLAIMS TO HAVE EQUAL

00:19:02.674 --> 00:19:07.679
PRIORITY UNDER BANKRUPTCY LAW --

00:19:07.746 --> 00:19:08.847
THIS CREATES INCENTIVES FOR

00:19:08.914 --> 00:19:12.918
QUALIFY ESTIMATE AT A LOWER

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:14.186
NUMBER THE VARIOUS CLAIMS THAT

00:19:14.253 --> 00:19:15.921
ARE STARTED BY THE WILD FIRE

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:17.122
VICTIMS THAT WILL BE ONE OF THE

00:19:17.189 --> 00:19:18.991
MAIN ELEMENTS OF THIS BANKRUPTCY

00:19:19.057 --> 00:19:20.058
CASE TENSION BETWEEN.

00:19:20.125 --> 00:19:21.693
DIFFERENT GROUPS OF UNSECURED

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:22.694
CREDITORS --

00:19:22.761 --> 00:19:23.729
AND I EXPECT P. JEANNIE

00:19:23.795 --> 00:19:25.063
SHAREHOLDERS MIGHT ALSO GET

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:27.199
INVOLVED TO TRY TO DO WHAT THEY

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:29.935
CAN TO REDUCE THE P. GENIES

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:32.671
ASSERTED WILDFIRE LIABILITY.

00:19:32.738 --> 00:19:33.839
THIRD BANKRUPTCY LAW DRAWS A

00:19:33.906 --> 00:19:36.041
DISTINCTION BETWEEN P. PRE

00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:37.943
BANKRUPTCY CREDITORS AND THOSE

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.145
WHO HAVE CLAIMS THAT ARISE AFTER

00:19:40.212 --> 00:19:42.080
A BANKRUPTCY PETITION IS FILED.

00:19:42.147 --> 00:19:43.882
FOR EXAMPLE A WILDFIRE VICTIM

00:19:43.949 --> 00:19:45.150
FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN IS A PRE

00:19:45.217 --> 00:19:46.919
BANKRUPTCY CREDITOR OR A PRE

00:19:46.985 --> 00:19:48.420
PETITION CREDITOR ON THESE

THINK FOR VIEWS THIS IS

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:41.673
SOMETHING THAT IS BASED ON HOW

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.074
ACTIVELY THEY'VE BEEN INVOLVED

00:25:43.141 --> 00:25:44.876
IN THE BANKRUPTCY CASE SO FAR --

00:25:44.943 --> 00:25:46.578
I WANT TO UNDERSCORE SOMETHING

00:25:46.645 --> 00:25:48.079
WHICH IS THIS IS A DEEPLY

00:25:48.146 --> 00:25:49.748
COMPLICATED BARGAINING

00:25:49.814 --> 00:25:51.149
ENVIRONMENT --

00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:52.517
FORTUNATELY SOME OF THE BEST

00:25:52.584 --> 00:25:53.718
BANKRUPTCY LAWYERS IN THE

00:25:53.785 --> 00:25:55.120
COUNTRY ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON

00:25:55.186 --> 00:25:56.621
IT UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE A LOT

00:25:56.688 --> 00:25:56.922
OF THEM --

00:25:56.988 --> 00:25:58.957
BUT IT WILL STILL BE VERY VERY

00:25:59.024 --> 00:25:59.691
HARD --

00:25:59.758 --> 00:26:00.992
FINALLY JUST A COUPLE OF

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:01.860
THOUGHTS ABOUT WHERE ALL OF THIS

00:26:01.927 --> 00:26:03.528
IS GOING ON IN EXACTLY WHAT THE

00:26:03.595 --> 00:26:05.130
PROCESS WENT UP LOOKING LIKE P.

00:26:05.196 --> 00:26:06.498
JEANNIE HAS EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF

00:26:06.564 --> 00:26:07.732
EXCLUSIVITY WHICH MEANS THEY

00:26:07.799 --> 00:26:09.801
HAVE THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT. TO

00:26:09.868 --> 00:26:11.603
PROPOSE A PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:12.737
THIS AGENDA SETTING POWER PUTS

00:26:12.804 --> 00:26:14.673
P. GENIES BOARDING MANAGEMENT

00:26:14.739 --> 00:26:16.007
TEAM IN CONTROL OF THE CASE AND

00:26:16.074 --> 00:26:17.142
YOU EXPECT THAT THEY'LL TRY TO

00:26:17.208 --> 00:26:17.943
FINISH.

00:26:18.009 --> 00:26:19.911
THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS IN THAT

00:26:19.978 --> 00:26:21.713
EIGHTEEN MONTHS WITH THAT SAID

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:22.881
THE COMPANY HAS YET TO PORT FOR

00:26:22.948 --> 00:26:24.382
A PUBLIC VISION OF WHAT IT'S

00:26:24.449 --> 00:26:25.583
GOING TO LOOK LIKE WHEN IT

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:26.985
LEAVES BANKRUPTCY WHICH IS

00:26:27.052 --> 00:26:28.286
UNUSUAL AT THIS STAGE.

00:26:28.353 --> 00:26:29.621
USUALLY COMPANIES WILL HAVE DONE

00:26:29.688 --> 00:26:30.956
THAT IT SPEAKS TO HOW

00:26:31.022 --> 00:26:32.724
COMPLICATED THE SAYS --

00:26:32.791 --> 00:26:34.025
ENDS THERE ARE A VARIETY OF A

00:26:34.092 --> 00:26:36.261
VERY COMPLICATED QUESTIONS IN

00:26:36.328 --> 00:26:38.763
FRONT OF US AND MOST IMPORTANTLY --

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:40.198
HOW WILL P. JEANNIE DEAL WITH

00:26:40.265 --> 00:26:42.434
FUTURE LIABILITY --

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.969
JUDGE MENTALITY CAN ONLY APPROVE

00:26:44.035 --> 00:26:45.704
A PLAN TO ALLOW P. GENIE OUT OF

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:47.973
BANKRUPTCY IF P. JEANNIE CAN

00:26:48.039 --> 00:26:50.342
ASSERT WHAT WE WOULD CALL.

00:26:50.408 --> 00:26:52.043
ON A BOAT WITH A FEASIBLE PLAN

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.578
MEANING JUDGMENT HOLLY LOOKS AT

00:26:53.645 --> 00:26:54.879
THE PLANETS AS P. GENIES

00:26:54.946 --> 00:26:56.147
UNLIKELY TO BE BACK IN

00:26:56.214 --> 00:26:58.016
BANKRUPTCY ANYTIME SOON MAYBE

00:26:58.083 --> 00:26:59.084
TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW THE STORY

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:00.418
WILL BE DIFFERENT BUT JUDGMENT

00:27:00.485 --> 00:27:02.120
HOLLY WILL BE CONCERNED WITH THE

00:27:02.187 --> 00:27:05.690
NEXT FIVE YEARS --

00:27:05.757 --> 00:27:06.324
THIS MEANS THAT SOMETIME IN THE

00:27:06.391 --> 00:27:09.761
NEXT EIGHT WILDFIRE NOT ONLY

00:27:09.828 --> 00:27:10.862
THIS SUMMER --

00:27:10.929 --> 00:27:12.464
BUT GOING FORWARD HOW IS IT

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:13.798
GOING TO MANAGE THE FACT THAT IT

00:27:13.865 --> 00:27:16.034
NOW HAS THESE OPERATIONS THAT

00:27:16.101 --> 00:27:18.036
SEEM TO CREATE RISKS --

00:27:18.103 --> 00:27:20.005
THAT RESULT IN LIABILITY --

00:27:20.071 --> 00:27:21.306
WILL THERE BE SOME SORT OF

00:27:21.373 --> 00:27:22.540
RELIEF THAT MAY COME FROM THE

00:27:22.607 --> 00:27:24.109
STATE LEGISLATURE ON THAT'S A

00:27:24.175 --> 00:27:25.510
QUESTION THAT I THINK A LOT OF

00:27:25.577 --> 00:27:27.145
PEOPLE ARE WONDERING AND WE

00:27:27.212 --> 00:27:28.613
DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO AN AND

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.647
ANOTHER QUESTION THAT WE DON'T

00:27:29.714 --> 00:27:30.782
KNOW THE ANSWER TO IS.

00:27:30.849 --> 00:27:32.417
WILL THE LEGISLATURE HAVE TO

00:27:32.484 --> 00:27:34.352
PROVIDE SOME SORT OF RELIEF FOR

00:27:34.419 --> 00:27:35.954
PEACE YOU NEED TO HAVE A WAY OUT

00:27:36.021 --> 00:27:38.790
OF BANKRUPTCY --

00:27:38.857 --> 00:27:40.425
AND MY SECOND IN SEC MY SECOND

00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:41.993
POINT IS THE BANKRUPTCY LAW

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:43.928
REQUIRES A REGULATED ENTITY I'M

00:27:43.995 --> 00:27:44.829
TO HAVE THE APPROVAL OF ITS

00:27:44.896 --> 00:27:46.898
REGULATOR FOR ANY RATE INCREASE

00:27:46.965 --> 00:27:48.199
THAT IS PART OF A PLAN OF

00:27:48.266 --> 00:27:49.300
REORGANIZATION.

00:27:49.367 --> 00:27:50.668
THIS MEANS THE NOT WITHSTANDING

00:27:50.735 --> 00:27:52.170
THE AUTOMATIC STAY IN THE POWERS

00:27:52.237 --> 00:27:54.105
OF BANKRUPTCY LAW ON THE C. P.

00:27:54.172 --> 00:27:55.407
U. C. WILL HAVE AN IMPORTANT

00:27:55.473 --> 00:27:57.475
ROLE TO PLAY I'M IN SHAPING THE

00:27:57.542 --> 00:27:58.443
PROCESS SINCE THEY WILL NEED TO

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:00.578
AUTHORIZE A RATE INCREASE TO THE

00:28:00.645 --> 00:28:01.546
EXTENT THAT PAGE.

00:28:01.613 --> 00:28:03.248
P. JEANNIE NEEDS ONE ON IN

00:28:03.314 --> 00:28:05.917
CONCLUSION YOU SHOULD NOW THINK

00:28:05.984 --> 00:28:08.319
OF IT P. GENIE IS BEING STOCK IN

00:28:08.386 --> 00:28:09.954
THIS KIND OF FEDERALLY CREATED

00:28:10.021 --> 00:28:11.122
BARGAINING ENVIRONMENT WHERE

00:28:11.189 --> 00:28:12.357
THERE ARE LOTS OF PLAYERS ON ALL

00:28:12.424 --> 00:28:13.758
SIDES THAT WILL BE ASSERTING

00:28:13.825 --> 00:28:14.692
THEIR OWN INTERESTS.

00:28:14.759 --> 00:28:15.860
THERE'S ALSO A FEDERAL

00:28:15.927 --> 00:28:17.162
BANKRUPTCY JUDGE OVERSEEING THE

00:28:17.228 --> 00:28:18.596
PROCESS WHO IS THE JOB OF

00:28:18.663 --> 00:28:21.399
FINDING FACTS MAKING RULES AND

00:28:21.466 --> 00:28:22.901
PRODDING THE SIDES TO COME TO A

00:28:22.967 --> 00:28:24.502
NEGOTIATED RESOLUTION.

00:28:24.569 --> 00:28:25.837
GIVEN THE P. JEANNIE PERHAPS MAY

00:28:25.904 --> 00:28:27.338
NEED A RATE INCREASE THERE'S

00:28:27.405 --> 00:28:28.473
DEFINITELY A ROLE FOR THE STATE

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.141
GOVERNMENT TO PLAY IN SHAPING

00:28:30.208 --> 00:28:31.576
THE OUTCOME OF THE BANKRUPTCY.

00:28:31.643 --> 00:28:32.811
I'M IN FACT THE STATE GOVERNMENT

00:28:32.877 --> 00:28:34.746
MAY NEED TO PLAY A ROLE ON GIVEN

00:28:34.813 --> 00:28:35.914
THE GIVEN THE FACT THAT P.

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.282
JEANNIE NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO

00:28:37.348 --> 00:28:38.183
PROPOSE.

00:28:38.249 --> 00:28:39.417
A FEASIBLE PLAN OF YOUR

00:28:39.484 --> 00:28:41.152
ORGANIZATION THE JUDGE MENTALITY

00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:43.121
BELIEVES WON'T BE FOLLOWED BY A

00:28:43.188 --> 00:28:44.889
SUBSEQUENT BANKRUPTCY FILING --

00:28:58.369 --> 00:29:00.638
THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF THIS

00:29:00.705 --> 00:29:01.873
CASES ARE UNFOLDING [inaudible]

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.943
OF ACCESSIBLE TO YOU IN TERMS OF

SO MY INVOLVEMENT TO THE IN THIS

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:13.084
CASE HAS BEEN FOLLOWING THE

COURT DOCKETS BECAUSE ALL OF

00:29:14.953 --> 00:29:16.921
THESE FILINGS ARE PUBLIC --

00:29:16.988 --> 00:29:17.789
I'VE ALSO HAD VARIOUS

00:29:17.856 --> 00:29:20.425

I'M NOT PRIVY TO ANY

00:29:27.765 --> 00:29:29.134
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION ABOUT

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.768
WHERE NEGOTIATIONS ARE AND I

00:29:30.835 --> 00:29:32.237
DON'T HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF ANY

00:29:32.303 --> 00:29:34.472
KIND OF LEGISLATION AND THAT IS

00:29:34.539 --> 00:29:36.074
IN THE WORKS THAT MIGHT PROVIDE

00:29:36.141 --> 00:29:37.909
FOR SOME SORT OF REGULATORY

00:29:37.976 --> 00:29:38.276
ANYTHING.

00:29:38.343 --> 00:29:39.878
COMING OUT OF THIS BANKRUPTCY

00:29:39.944 --> 00:29:41.579
CASE SO I AM VERY MUCH AN

AND TO THIS FITS VERY MUCH WITH

00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:45.750
THE PRACTICE EXPERIENCE THAT I

00:29:45.817 --> 00:29:46.484
HAD PRIOR TO BECOMING AN

00:29:46.551 --> 00:29:48.386
ACADEMIC OF WORKING ON LARGE

00:29:48.453 --> 00:29:49.387

00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:50.788
KNOWLEDGE THAT I BRING TO BEAR

THANK YOU JUST FOR THE RECORD.

00:29:54.092 --> 00:29:55.860

00:29:55.927 --> 00:29:57.028
CERTAINLY NOT MYSELF --

00:29:57.095 --> 00:29:58.863
OR ARE WE ARE ALSO PRETTY TO CON

00:29:58.930 --> 00:29:59.964
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

00:30:00.031 --> 00:30:01.833
REGARDING THIS CASE.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.301
I ALSO WANT TO ASK --

00:30:03.368 --> 00:30:06.871
IN YOUR ANALYSIS HAVE YOU FOUND

00:30:06.938 --> 00:30:09.507
ANY EVIDENCE ASSISTING SUGGEST

00:30:09.574 --> 00:30:11.743
THE USE OF P. GINNY IS TRYING TO

00:30:11.809 --> 00:30:12.277
GET OUT OF POWER PURCHASE

00:30:12.343 --> 00:30:13.678
AGREEMENTS --

00:30:13.745 --> 00:30:16.681
THEY HAVE YET TO SIGNAL THAT

00:30:16.748 --> 00:30:18.016
THEY WILL --

00:30:18.082 --> 00:30:20.185
HOWEVER THEY WOULD IT WOULD HAVE

00:30:20.251 --> 00:30:21.920
BEEN MALPRACTICE HAD THEY NOT

00:30:21.986 --> 00:30:23.188
SIGNAL THAT THE BEGINNING THAT

00:30:23.254 --> 00:30:24.989
THEY WOULD LIKE TO RESERVE THE

00:30:25.056 --> 00:30:27.759
OPTION TO DO SO. ONE OF THE

00:30:27.825 --> 00:30:28.359
THINGS THE DEBTORS AND CHAPTER

00:30:28.426 --> 00:30:30.662
LET -- TORY

00:30:30.728 --> 00:30:32.230
RIGHT TO TERROR CONTRACTS THEY

00:30:32.297 --> 00:30:33.565
TRY TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN

00:30:33.631 --> 00:30:35.433
THREATEN TO USE THAT RIGHT IN

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.101
THE HOPES OF RENEGOTIATING

00:30:37.168 --> 00:30:37.335
THINGS.

00:30:37.402 --> 00:30:39.003
EVEN IF THEY DON'T --

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:39.637
THREATENED IF THEY DON'T

00:30:39.704 --> 00:30:40.905
ACTUALLY.

00:30:40.972 --> 00:30:42.073
THE CONTRACTS THAT TO MY

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:43.508
KNOWLEDGE THEY HAVE NOT.

00:30:43.575 --> 00:30:45.543
THREATEN TO YOU SO BUT THEY ARE --

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:46.711
IN THE PROCESS AND USING

00:30:46.778 --> 00:30:49.113
LITIGATION TO ASSERT A PATHWAY

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.882
THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO DO SO

00:30:50.949 --> 00:30:52.050
MOST YOU KNOW PERHAPS AND

00:30:52.116 --> 00:30:54.018
SPECULATING --

00:30:54.085 --> 00:30:57.222
TO THEN PROVOKE RE NEGOTIATIONS.

00:30:57.288 --> 00:30:58.723
AND JUST EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MIGHT

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:00.491
MEAN I I GUESS MONTH MOST OF THE

00:31:00.558 --> 00:31:02.727
MEMBERS OF PROBABLY KNOW BUT IN

00:31:02.794 --> 00:31:04.162
PREVIOUS YEARS WHEN RATES WERE

00:31:04.229 --> 00:31:05.363
HIGHER --

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:07.966
UTILITIES ENTERED INTO CONTRACTS

00:31:08.032 --> 00:31:09.801
LONG TERM CONTRACTS --

00:31:09.867 --> 00:31:12.637
AND ON OUR ARE TIED.

00:31:12.704 --> 00:31:14.372
TO A PROVIDING SUPPLY AT A

00:31:14.439 --> 00:31:16.608
LARGER RATE SO YOU'RE YOU'RE

00:31:16.674 --> 00:31:16.975
THINKING THAT --

00:31:17.041 --> 00:31:19.744
BY THEM --

00:31:19.811 --> 00:31:21.546
DISCLOSING THAT THEY MAKE UP ONE

00:31:21.613 --> 00:31:22.080
OF GET OUT OF THOSE POWER

00:31:22.146 --> 00:31:23.848
PURCHASE AGREEMENTS A COURT

00:31:23.915 --> 00:31:25.917
COULD ACTUALLY GRANT.

00:31:25.984 --> 00:31:26.784
THEM GETTING OUT OF THAT IF THEY

00:31:26.851 --> 00:31:28.553
CAN SHOW THAT THEY CAN ENTER

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.221
INTO ANOTHER GREEN TODAY WITH

00:31:30.288 --> 00:31:31.723
ANOTHER PROVIDER.

00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:33.057
OR EVEN WITH THE SAME PROVIDER

00:31:33.124 --> 00:31:34.726
AT A LOWER RATE WHICH WOULD COST

00:31:34.792 --> 00:31:36.794
RESULT IN SAVINGS TO THE UTILITY

00:31:36.861 --> 00:31:39.197
IN PROVIDING THE ENERGY FOR

00:31:39.264 --> 00:31:40.765
EXAMPLE SO I WANT TO CAST.

00:31:40.832 --> 00:31:42.033
IT'S A GREAT QUESTION --

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.334
I WANT TO QUALIFY MAY ANSWER TO

00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:44.969
THIS BY SAYING THAT THE LAW IS

00:31:45.036 --> 00:31:48.339
ON CERTAIN SO BURKE HAS ASSERTED

00:31:48.406 --> 00:31:50.308
THAT THEY CAN'T DO IT --

00:31:50.375 --> 00:31:52.977
IN P. GENIE IS URRENTLY SOFT --

00:31:53.044 --> 00:31:53.945
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THEY'RE

00:31:54.012 --> 00:31:55.546
LOOKING FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT

00:31:55.613 --> 00:31:57.615
FROM JUDGE MENTALITY THAT NO

00:31:57.682 --> 00:31:59.083
THEY'RE ALLOWED TO DO IT SO

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:01.085
THERE IS THIS LIKE SIDE SHOW --

00:32:01.152 --> 00:32:01.919
YOU KNOW THAT ISN'T REALLY

00:32:01.986 --> 00:32:04.022
CENTRAL TO P. GENIES BANKRUPTCY

00:32:04.088 --> 00:32:04.989
BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOING

00:32:05.056 --> 00:32:06.791
ON WE'RE P. GENIE IS IN

00:32:06.858 --> 00:32:09.327
LITIGATION WITH BURKE --

00:32:09.394 --> 00:32:12.664
AND WHATEVER HAPPENS IN THAT LED --

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:14.132
TO FOR IS ALSO ASSERTED THAT

00:32:14.198 --> 00:32:15.400
SOME OF THOSE AGREEMENTS --

00:32:15.466 --> 00:32:17.268
HAVE THE FORCE OF LAW EVEN IF

00:32:17.335 --> 00:32:18.403
YOU TORE UP THE CONTRACT THEIR

00:32:18.469 --> 00:32:20.071
VARIOUS REGULATIONS THAT WOULD

00:32:20.138 --> 00:32:21.606
NOT ALLOW PIECE YOU NEED TO GET

00:32:21.673 --> 00:32:22.940
OUT OF ITS BECAUSE THEY'RE PART

00:32:23.007 --> 00:32:23.841
OF BROADER.

00:32:23.908 --> 00:32:25.209
FROM REGULATORY SCHEMES THAT

00:32:25.276 --> 00:32:27.812
EXIST AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL --

00:32:27.879 --> 00:32:29.113
BUT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT P.

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.050
JEANNIE CAN THE LAW IS UNCERTAIN

00:32:32.116 --> 00:32:33.651
AND IT WOULD BE REASONABLE TO

00:32:33.718 --> 00:32:35.687
EXPECT T. G. NEED. TO TEST THE

00:32:35.753 --> 00:32:37.088
BOUNDARIES OF THAT LAW WHILE

00:32:37.155 --> 00:32:38.956
THEY'RE IN BANKRUPTCY BECAUSE IT

00:32:39.023 --> 00:32:41.392
COULD HAVE.

00:32:41.459 --> 00:32:43.494
A BIG IMPACT IN TERMS OF VALUE

00:32:43.561 --> 00:32:47.098
TO A TO THE POTENTIALLY.

00:32:47.165 --> 00:32:48.232
FINANCIALLY IT'S UNCLEAR AYE AYE

00:32:48.299 --> 00:32:49.934
IT'S UNCLEAR SOME PEOPLE SAY

00:32:50.001 --> 00:32:52.270
QUITE ENDS BUT IT QUITE OKAY.

00:32:52.337 --> 00:32:53.237
AND AND YOU MENTIONED THAT

00:32:53.304 --> 00:32:54.939
THERE'S AN IN THAT THIS

00:32:55.006 --> 00:32:56.174
BANKRUPTCY.

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.775
CAN EXTEND EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR IS

00:32:57.842 --> 00:32:59.811
THAT IS THAT A TERM OF EIGHTEEN

00:32:59.877 --> 00:33:01.179
MINDS -- IN

00:33:01.245 --> 00:33:04.482
STATUTE IS THAT AN ESTIMATE --

00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:06.484
CAN CAN THIS BE RESOLVED PRIOR

00:33:06.551 --> 00:33:07.819
TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR YOU

00:33:07.885 --> 00:33:09.887
EXPECTED THIS WOULD TAKE THE

00:33:09.954 --> 00:33:10.955
FULL EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO RESOLVE

00:33:11.022 --> 00:33:12.256
THIS BANKRUPTCY.

00:33:12.323 --> 00:33:13.558
SO IT'S A STATUS SO THERE'S A

00:33:13.624 --> 00:33:15.593
STATUTORY PERIOD WE'RE PEKINGESE

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:16.794
MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS THE

00:33:16.861 --> 00:33:18.329
EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO PROPOSE A

00:33:18.396 --> 00:33:19.964
PLAN OF ORGANIZATION AND THAT'S

00:33:20.031 --> 00:33:21.999
THAT EIGHTEEN MONTH PERIOD --

00:33:22.066 --> 00:33:24.669
AND IN GENERAL IT WOULD BE

00:33:24.736 --> 00:33:25.403
MALPRACTICE ON THE PART OF P.

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:27.004
GENIES LAWYERS IF THEY DIDN'T

00:33:27.071 --> 00:33:29.173
TRY THEIR HARDEST TO GET OUT OF

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.308
BANKRUPTCY BEFORE THAT EIGHTEEN

00:33:30.375 --> 00:33:31.476
MONTHS IS NOT THERE'S A LITTLE

00:33:31.542 --> 00:33:33.111
BIT OF FLEXIBILITY TOWARDS THE

00:33:33.177 --> 00:33:33.311
END.

00:33:33.378 --> 00:33:35.146
BUT IN GENERAL YOU CAN THINK OF

00:33:35.213 --> 00:33:36.180
EIGHTEEN MONTHS TWO YEARS HAS

00:33:36.247 --> 00:33:37.482
ABOUT THE PERIOD WE'RE P. GENIES

00:33:37.548 --> 00:33:39.050
MANAGEMENT TEAM WILL CONTROL THE

00:33:39.117 --> 00:33:40.885
BANKRUPTCY PROCESS ONCE THAT

00:33:40.952 --> 00:33:42.487
PERIOD LAPSES IT'S NOT THE CASE

00:33:42.553 --> 00:33:44.055
THE PEKINGESE AND THROWN OUT A

00:33:44.122 --> 00:33:44.722
BANKRUPTCY.

00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:47.024
INSTEAD --

00:33:47.091 --> 00:33:50.595
OTHER PARTY.

00:33:50.661 --> 00:33:52.930
GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE BANKRUPTCY

00:33:52.997 --> 00:33:54.432
AND THE SOPHISTICATION OF P.

00:33:54.499 --> 00:33:56.367
GENIES CREDITORS AND INVESTORS

00:33:56.434 --> 00:33:57.869
THAT WOULD CERTAIN.

00:33:57.935 --> 00:33:59.103
THAT WOULD BE A PROCESS THAT

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:02.073
WOULD CERTAINLY BECOME A CIRCUS --

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.541
WHERE THEY WOULD BE YOU KNOW

00:34:03.608 --> 00:34:05.543
MEET TEN FIFTEEN DIFFERENT PLANS

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:06.844
ON THE TABLE --

00:34:06.911 --> 00:34:08.045
JUDGMENT HOW HE WOULD FIND THAT

00:34:08.112 --> 00:34:09.647
PROCESS VERY CHALLENGING TO

00:34:09.714 --> 00:34:12.383
MANAGE AND EVERYONE WILL WORK

00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:13.885
VERY HARD TO AVOID THAT

00:34:13.951 --> 00:34:15.052
HAPPENING WE CALL THAT IN

00:34:15.119 --> 00:34:17.255
BANKRUPTCY SPEAK A COMPETING

00:34:17.321 --> 00:34:18.256
PLAN PROCESS.

00:34:18.322 --> 00:34:20.024
TEACHING YOU WILL NEED A PLAN OF

00:34:20.091 --> 00:34:21.259
ORGANIZATION TO GET OUT OF

00:34:21.325 --> 00:34:22.560
BANKRUPTCY --

00:34:22.627 --> 00:34:23.961
AND YOU HOPE THAT IT HAPPENS

00:34:24.028 --> 00:34:27.031
WITHIN THAT YOU KNOW TWO YEAR OR

00:34:27.098 --> 00:34:29.500
SO WINDOW.

00:34:29.567 --> 00:34:31.602
MONTHS --

00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:33.471
WORK I MEAN OF WORKS

00:34:33.538 --> 00:34:34.806
CONCURRENTLY WITH OUR CALENDAR

00:34:34.872 --> 00:34:36.340
WE'RE GOING TO BE --

00:34:36.407 --> 00:34:40.011
HERE CREATING NEW LAWS OR WORK

00:34:40.077 --> 00:34:41.312
WORKING ON DIFFERENT THINGS THAT

00:34:41.379 --> 00:34:42.914
MAY AFFECT P. GINNY EITHER

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:46.250
FAVORABLY OR NEGATIVELY --

00:34:46.317 --> 00:34:48.419
THROUGH AT LEAST OCTOBER TO

00:34:48.486 --> 00:34:50.755
SEPTEMBER --

00:34:50.822 --> 00:34:52.089
AND THE GOVERNOR WILL HAVE.

00:34:52.156 --> 00:34:53.991
THE PROCESS OF SIGNING IN

00:34:54.058 --> 00:34:56.627
BETWEEN BILLS.

00:34:56.694 --> 00:34:59.697
COULD OUR ACTION HERE.

00:34:59.764 --> 00:35:02.400
ALL CHURCH CHANGE INFLUENCE

00:35:02.467 --> 00:35:04.001
WHATEVER'S HAPPENING IN THROUGH

00:35:04.068 --> 00:35:06.037
THE JUDICIAL BANKRUPTCY PROCESS

00:35:06.103 --> 00:35:06.771
SO.

00:35:06.838 --> 00:35:09.240
IF IF WE INTRODUCE A BILL OR

00:35:09.307 --> 00:35:10.875
PROPOSE --

00:35:10.942 --> 00:35:14.412
SOME KIND OF LEGISLATION WOULD

00:35:14.479 --> 00:35:16.948
THAT ALTER THE DYNAMICS OF THE

00:35:17.014 --> 00:35:19.317
DISCUSSION IN THE BAT BANKRUPTCY.

00:35:19.383 --> 00:35:22.520
I'M ABSOLUTELY YOU KNOW SIR PC.

00:35:22.587 --> 00:35:24.021
WE NEED BECAUSE OF ITS UNIQUE

00:35:24.088 --> 00:35:25.690
STATUS AS A HYBRID PUBLIC

00:35:25.756 --> 00:35:27.358
PRIVATE ENTITY --

00:35:27.425 --> 00:35:29.527
THE RED IN THE RELATIONSHIP IT

00:35:29.594 --> 00:35:31.128
HAS WITH ITS REGULATORS AND LAWS

00:35:31.195 --> 00:35:33.464
THAT A PROPOSED HERE --

00:35:33.531 --> 00:35:34.899
COULD VERY MUCH IN --

00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:38.135
IMPACT ITS TRAJECTORY GOING I

00:35:38.202 --> 00:35:40.104
WOULD IMAGINE NOT ONLY THAT YOU

00:35:40.171 --> 00:35:41.539
KNOW YOU COULD INFLUENCE THE

00:35:41.606 --> 00:35:43.541
BANKRUPTCY CASE BUT ALSO --

00:35:43.608 --> 00:35:45.776
IN HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH

00:35:45.843 --> 00:35:47.545
INVESTORS THERE'S AN EXPECTATION

00:35:47.612 --> 00:35:48.779
I THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR AND

00:35:48.846 --> 00:35:50.515
THE LEGISLATURE WILL LEAD IN

00:35:50.581 --> 00:35:52.683
PROVIDING A PATH FOR P. GENIE

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:54.285
OUT OF BANKRUPTCY THIS AT LEAST

00:35:54.352 --> 00:35:55.853
WILL MANY PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.923
SO GIVEN YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF

00:35:58.990 --> 00:35:59.991
OF OF BANKRUPTCIES I MEAN

00:36:00.057 --> 00:36:01.092
USUALLY --

00:36:01.158 --> 00:36:04.061
BANKRUPTCIES ARE ARE DEALT WITH.

00:36:04.128 --> 00:36:06.364
IN IN A IN A CLOSE PROCESS.

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:08.199
WITHIN THE JUDICIAL PROCESS BUT

00:36:08.266 --> 00:36:11.002
GIVEN THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN.

00:36:11.068 --> 00:36:13.037
CAN INFLUENCE THAT THERE WAS A

00:36:13.104 --> 00:36:14.639
ACTION.

00:36:14.705 --> 00:36:17.008
DO YOU KNOW OF A PROCESS OF

00:36:17.074 --> 00:36:18.643
COMMUNICATING BETWEEN THE

00:36:18.709 --> 00:36:20.344
BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT IN TERMS

00:36:20.411 --> 00:36:22.747
OF HOW THAT CAN NEGATIVE IT OR

00:36:22.813 --> 00:36:24.215
ADVERSELY AFFECT THAT I MEAN.

00:36:24.282 --> 00:36:24.982
BECAUSE THEY'LL BE DIFFERENT

00:36:25.049 --> 00:36:28.019
PARTIES PROBABLY SEEKING IN.

00:36:28.085 --> 00:36:30.154
SOME ADVANTAGE ONE WAY OR

00:36:30.221 --> 00:36:31.389
ANOTHER COME INTO US SAYING CAN

00:36:31.455 --> 00:36:32.657
YOU DO THIS CAN YOU DO THAT AND

00:36:32.723 --> 00:36:35.793
THE FACT THIS FOR OUR BENEFIT.

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:39.363
AND WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A WAY.

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:40.798
TO TWO YOU KNOW --

00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:42.099
DISCUSS THAT THAT THE

00:36:42.166 --> 00:36:45.269
IMPLICATIONS OF OF OUR ACTIONS

00:36:45.336 --> 00:36:47.805
TO THAT NEGOTIATION PROCESS OF

00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:48.940
YOU MENTION EVERYTHING YOU'VE

00:36:49.006 --> 00:36:49.574
DESCRIBED.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.342
IN TERMS OF HOW HOW [inaudible]

00:36:51.409 --> 00:36:58.616
DYNAMIC AND COMPLICATED AND AND

00:36:58.683 --> 00:37:00.184
YOU KNOW WITH ALL THESE SO MANY

00:37:00.251 --> 00:37:01.819
PARTIES TO THIS.

00:37:01.886 --> 00:37:04.121
CLAIM IN PARTICULAR --

00:37:04.188 --> 00:37:07.191
BEYOND BONDHOLDERS STOCKHOLDERS --

00:37:07.258 --> 00:37:09.026
VICTIMS YOU KNOW THE WHOLE LONG

00:37:09.093 --> 00:37:10.728
LIST.

00:37:10.795 --> 00:37:11.762
YOU ALSO HAVE LEGISLATIVE

00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:13.864
ELEMENT HERE THAT CAN.

00:37:13.931 --> 00:37:15.366
MAKE THINGS BETTER OR WORSE --

00:37:15.433 --> 00:37:16.067
IS THERE.

00:37:16.133 --> 00:37:18.269
A CONNECTION --

00:37:18.336 --> 00:37:19.937
IS THE LEGISLATIVE AND PROP --

00:37:20.004 --> 00:37:22.173
ALIMENT I THINK INTRODUCES MUCH

00:37:22.239 --> 00:37:24.408
MORE UNCERTAINTY IN COMPLEXITY

00:37:24.475 --> 00:37:25.977
THAT IS IN THE CASE OF ANY OTHER

00:37:26.043 --> 00:37:27.678
LARGE CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY THAT

00:37:27.745 --> 00:37:29.246
I'M AWARE OF I THINK THAT THE

00:37:29.313 --> 00:37:30.081
CHAIRMAN'S --

00:37:30.147 --> 00:37:31.749
INSTINCT IS CORRECT AND YOU ARE

00:37:31.816 --> 00:37:32.817
GOING TO START HEARING AND YOU

00:37:32.883 --> 00:37:35.086
MAY ALREADY BE HEARING FROM MANY

00:37:35.152 --> 00:37:36.420
PARTIES TO P. WHO HAVE AN

00:37:36.487 --> 00:37:38.022
INTEREST IN P. JEANNIE --

00:37:38.089 --> 00:37:39.957
WHEN I WAS A LAWYER IN PRIVATE

00:37:40.024 --> 00:37:41.092
PRACTICE I REPRESENTED CREDITORS

00:37:41.158 --> 00:37:42.693
IN THE BANKRUPTCY CASE WHERE WE

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.829
TOOK CONCERNS THAT WE HAD TO

00:37:44.895 --> 00:37:46.097
FEDERAL REGULATORS ABOUT ASPECTS

00:37:46.163 --> 00:37:47.865
OF THAT BANKRUPTCY CASE --

00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:49.667
YOU CAN IMAGINE YOU WILL HEAR

00:37:49.734 --> 00:37:51.235
FROM LOTS OF PEOPLE THEY WILL

00:37:51.302 --> 00:37:52.970
HAVE THEIR OWN PAROCHIAL

00:37:53.037 --> 00:37:54.505
INTERESTS THEN SOMETIMES THEY

00:37:54.572 --> 00:37:55.840
MAY HAVE THE PUBLIC INTEREST AT

00:37:55.906 --> 00:37:56.073
HEART.

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:57.642
BUT YES YOU WILL HEAR FROM ALL

00:37:57.708 --> 00:38:00.277
OF THEM THERE IS NO THIS CREATED

00:38:00.344 --> 00:38:02.980
BY BANKRUPTCY LAW TO KIND OF

00:38:03.047 --> 00:38:04.181
MEDIATE.

00:38:04.248 --> 00:38:05.449
THE INTERACTIONS THAT WALKER

00:38:05.516 --> 00:38:06.917
BETWEEN I SUPPOSE MEMBERS OF

00:38:06.984 --> 00:38:09.120
THIS COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THE

00:38:09.186 --> 00:38:10.287
STATE ASSEMBLY IN THE STATE

00:38:10.354 --> 00:38:12.323
SENATE AND YOU KNOW CREDITORS

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:13.891
BUT I YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT YOU

00:38:13.958 --> 00:38:15.726
KNOW PART OF IT WOULD BE

00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:16.927
MALPRACTICE ON THE PART OF

00:38:16.994 --> 00:38:18.195
LAWYERS FOR CREDITORS IF THEY

00:38:18.262 --> 00:38:19.363
DID NOT CONSIDER.

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:21.298
THE LARGE ROLE THAT REGULATORY

00:38:21.365 --> 00:38:22.833
RELIEF MIGHT PLAY IN THIS CASE

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:23.868
AND WHETHER THEY WANT TO TRY TO

00:38:23.934 --> 00:38:25.136
SHAPE THAT.

00:38:25.202 --> 00:38:26.170
AND GIVEN THAT WE'RE NOT WE'RE

00:38:26.237 --> 00:38:27.905
NOT PARTY OR PRIVY TO THE

00:38:27.972 --> 00:38:30.975
INTERNAL --

00:38:31.042 --> 00:38:33.144
NEGOTIATIONS HAPPENING WITHIN

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:35.713
THIS BANKRUPTCY HOW WOULD YOU

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.048
DESCRIBE.

00:38:37.114 --> 00:38:39.350
OUR INVOLVEMENT IN TRYING

00:38:39.417 --> 00:38:39.917
[inaudible]

00:38:39.984 --> 00:38:41.886
TO IMPROVE.

00:38:41.952 --> 00:38:44.021
THE THE THE SITUATION OF THE

00:38:44.088 --> 00:38:44.722
BANKRUPTCY HOW DO WE GET

00:38:44.789 --> 00:38:47.591
INFORMATION HOW DO WE PROPOSE A

00:38:47.658 --> 00:38:49.193
SOLUTION IF WE DON'T KNOW.

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:50.294
NECESSARILY WHAT'S HAPPENING

00:38:50.361 --> 00:38:53.698
INTERNALLY.

00:38:53.764 --> 00:38:54.331
IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF NOISE

00:38:54.398 --> 00:38:55.433
ARE.

00:38:55.499 --> 00:38:57.868
GOING TO HEAR A LOT OF NOISE --

00:38:57.935 --> 00:38:59.804
AND BUT I MIGHT HEAR FROM THE

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:00.938
LOUDEST VOICE IS NOT NECESSARILY

00:39:01.005 --> 00:39:04.909
THE THE ONES THAT ARE.

00:39:04.975 --> 00:39:05.576
REALLY --

00:39:05.643 --> 00:39:06.410
THOUGH WOULD THAT NECESSARILY

00:39:06.477 --> 00:39:08.212
THE ONES THAT NEED TO BE HEARD I

00:39:08.279 --> 00:39:09.947
THINK THAT'S CORRECT --

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:11.282
SO YOU KNOW YOU YOU WOULD HAVE A

00:39:11.348 --> 00:39:13.250
NUMBER OF OPTIONS IF YOU WOULD

00:39:13.317 --> 00:39:14.819
LIKE TO CONSIDER CREATING SOME

00:39:14.885 --> 00:39:17.588
SORT OF CONSOLIDATED PROCESS --

00:39:17.655 --> 00:39:18.522
ONE IS YOU COULD HIRE A

00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:20.691
BANKRUPTCY LAWYER WHO WILL THEN

00:39:20.758 --> 00:39:22.960
BE KNOWN AS A PERSON FOR WHO

00:39:23.027 --> 00:39:23.994
PEOPLE CAN TALK TO AND THAT

00:39:24.061 --> 00:39:25.096
PERSON CAN ACT AS AN

00:39:25.162 --> 00:39:27.164
INTERMEDIARY --

00:39:27.231 --> 00:39:27.998
FOR THE COMMITTEE AS A WHOLE --

00:39:28.065 --> 00:39:31.635
I YOU COULD TRY TO SET UP SOME

00:39:31.702 --> 00:39:34.338
STORM A FORMAL PROCESS PERHAPS.

00:39:34.405 --> 00:39:36.040
I DON'T KNOW WITH IT MAKING IT

00:39:36.107 --> 00:39:37.675
EASY TO COMMENT ON THE INTERNET

00:39:37.742 --> 00:39:38.909
THAT I'M NOT SURE --

00:39:38.976 --> 00:39:40.544
WHETHER THAT'S SOMETHING LIKE

00:39:40.611 --> 00:39:42.480
THAT IS ALREADY IN PLACE BUT EAT

00:39:42.546 --> 00:39:43.748
YEAH I THINK I THINK THE CHAIR

00:39:43.814 --> 00:39:44.949
IS CORRECT IN SUGGESTING THAT

00:39:45.015 --> 00:39:46.684
YOU'LL WANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW

00:39:46.751 --> 00:39:48.452
DO WE MAKE SURETHAT YOU'RE NOT

00:39:48.519 --> 00:39:50.421
JUST HEARING FROM THE WEALTHIEST

00:39:50.488 --> 00:39:52.590
AND THE LARGEST VOICES.

00:39:52.656 --> 00:39:53.657
BUT ALSO YOU'RE HEARING FROM

00:39:53.724 --> 00:39:54.959
EVERYONE CONCERNED WITH P.

00:39:55.025 --> 00:39:56.861
JEANNIE AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE

00:39:56.927 --> 00:39:57.962
COMPLEXITY OF THIS INFORMATION

00:39:58.028 --> 00:39:59.897
ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU COULD BE

00:39:59.964 --> 00:40:01.966
HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH FOR

00:40:02.032 --> 00:40:02.767
EXAMPLE --

00:40:02.833 --> 00:40:04.468
CINEMA COUNTY AND YOU KNOW

00:40:04.535 --> 00:40:05.903
UNDERSTANDING THEIR CONCERNS ALL

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:08.038
THE SAME TIME THERE NEGOTIATIONS

00:40:08.105 --> 00:40:09.940
GOING ON ELSEWHERE --

00:40:10.007 --> 00:40:11.008
A SITUATION THAT I THINK YOU

00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:13.744
SHOULD BE COGNIZANT OF IS THAT --

00:40:13.811 --> 00:40:15.846
YOU KNOW THE PARTIES COULD BUILD

00:40:15.913 --> 00:40:18.949
A BANKRUPTCY DE ALL AROUND SOME

00:40:19.016 --> 00:40:20.151
EXPECTED CONTRIBUTION OR

00:40:20.217 --> 00:40:22.853
LEGISLATION THAT THEY BELIEVE

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.121
THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO GIVE TEM --

00:40:24.188 --> 00:40:25.322
WHICH COULD PUT YOU ON IN A

00:40:25.389 --> 00:40:27.124
POSITION WHERE YOU MAY HAVE TO

00:40:27.191 --> 00:40:29.794
DECIDE DO WE WANT TO GIVE THIS

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.562
TO EVERYONE WHEN YOU KNOW

00:40:31.629 --> 00:40:32.930
PERHAPS THE BANKRUPTCY JUDGES IN

00:40:32.997 --> 00:40:34.265
FAVOR OF IT AND ALL THE PARTIES

00:40:34.331 --> 00:40:36.033
TO THE CASE THAT ARE BIG PARTIES

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:37.201
ARE IN FAVOR OF AN A MINIMUM.

00:40:37.268 --> 00:40:39.069
MENTON FOR THAT COULD BUILD.

00:40:39.136 --> 00:40:41.939
AND WE MAY BE FAR FROM THAT.

00:40:42.006 --> 00:40:46.143
YES SENATOR HILL THANK YOU CHAIR

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:46.844
THANKS FOR THE GOOD QUESTION

00:40:46.911 --> 00:40:47.978
LIKE FOR ME I APPRECIATE THAT --

00:40:48.045 --> 00:40:49.814
PROFESSOR WELCOME AND THANK YOU

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.582
FOR YOUR YOUR INPUT AND AND I

00:40:51.649 --> 00:40:53.017
HAVE TWO QUICK QUESTIONS IF I

00:40:53.083 --> 00:40:53.250
COULD.

00:40:53.317 --> 00:40:55.085
THE REORGANIZATION PLAN I'M KIND

00:40:55.152 --> 00:40:59.623
OF OF WHENEVER IT COMES FORWARD --

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:00.858
IF IT'S PRESENTED THAT'S A BY

00:41:00.925 --> 00:41:02.126
PETE P. JEANNIE UP AND THEN

00:41:02.193 --> 00:41:02.893
THERE'S THE ISSUE OF WITH

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.728
IMPAIRED CLASS IF IT AGREES TO

00:41:04.795 --> 00:41:06.964
SUPPORT THAT REORGANIZATION.

00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:11.068
THE GENERALLY THAT --

00:41:11.135 --> 00:41:11.836
THAT APPROVED THE PLAN AND THAT

00:41:11.902 --> 00:41:13.304
SEEMS LIKE A VERY LOW THRESHOLD

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:14.438
IN THAT COULD YOU EXPLAIN HOW

00:41:14.505 --> 00:41:16.073
THAT WORKS WE'VE.

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:18.042
SURE HAS SO ON THE WAY THE

00:41:18.108 --> 00:41:19.476
BANKRUPTCY LAW WORKS IS AGAIN

00:41:19.543 --> 00:41:20.778
THE IDEAL IS A PLAN THAT

00:41:20.845 --> 00:41:22.079
EVERYBODY SUPPORTS BUT TO THE

00:41:22.146 --> 00:41:24.114
EXTENT THAT EVERYBODY DOES NOT

00:41:24.181 --> 00:41:25.549
SUPPORT THE PLAN BANKRUPTCY LAW

00:41:25.616 --> 00:41:28.152
PROVIDES A ROUTE. FOR A COMPANY

00:41:28.219 --> 00:41:30.120
TO GET A PLAN APPROVED WITH OUT

00:41:30.187 --> 00:41:32.523
EVERYONE'S BY AND AND THAT'S

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:33.991
PLAN GENERALLY HAS A COP A BUNCH

00:41:34.058 --> 00:41:35.593
OF REQUIREMENTS --

00:41:35.659 --> 00:41:36.360
ONE THAT SENATOR HELL JUST

00:41:36.427 --> 00:41:38.128
MENTIONED IS THE REQUIREMENT OF

00:41:38.195 --> 00:41:39.663
AN IMPAIRED ACCEPTING CLASS

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:40.664
MEANING THAT SOME GROUP OF

00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:42.833
CREDITORS WHO WILL.

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.969
NOT BE MADE WHOLE UNDER THE PLAN --

00:41:45.035 --> 00:41:46.770
DECIDE THAT THEY WILLSUPPORT IT

00:41:46.837 --> 00:41:48.672
AND BANKRUPTCY LAW VIEWS THIS AS

00:41:48.739 --> 00:41:50.875
A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN A

00:41:50.941 --> 00:41:51.976
POSITION WHERE THEY HAVE TO TAKE

00:41:52.042 --> 00:41:53.510
A LOSS IN THERE SAYING WE'RE

00:41:53.577 --> 00:41:55.212
COMFORTABLE WITH THIS LOSS --

00:41:55.279 --> 00:41:56.280
AND THEN THERE'S SOME LEVEL OF

00:41:56.347 --> 00:41:57.715
MINIMUM TREATMENTS THAT IS

00:41:57.781 --> 00:41:59.950
REQUIRED BY LAW FOR EVERYONE

00:42:00.017 --> 00:42:01.685
ELSE ON THE TO THE EXTENT OF

00:42:01.752 --> 00:42:03.821
THAT DYNAMIC IS THERE THEN THE

00:42:03.888 --> 00:42:06.090
PLAN WILL BE APPROVED.

00:42:06.156 --> 00:42:08.259
ON HERE I'M IN ORDER FOR THERE

00:42:08.325 --> 00:42:09.693
TO BE IMPAIRED ACCEPTING CLASS

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.728
THAT'S MOST LIKELY GOING TO BE

00:42:10.794 --> 00:42:12.897
THE CLASS OF GENERAL UNSECURED

00:42:12.963 --> 00:42:14.198
CREDITORS INCLUDING THE BOND

00:42:14.265 --> 00:42:19.103
HOLDERS AND THE WILDFIRE VICTIMS --

00:42:19.169 --> 00:42:19.737
THEY COULD BE IN THE SAME CLASS

00:42:19.803 --> 00:42:22.640
THE DEPENDING ON WHAT THE SIZE

00:42:22.706 --> 00:42:24.808
THE WILDFIRE CLAIMS IS BECAUSE

00:42:24.875 --> 00:42:26.677
THAT IF THE WILDFIRE CLAIMS ARE

00:42:26.744 --> 00:42:28.078
LARGE ENOUGH THEY COULD HAVE THE

00:42:28.145 --> 00:42:29.113
ABILITY.

00:42:29.179 --> 00:42:30.915
TO BLOCK A YES VOTE FROM THE

00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:32.483
CLASS OR PERHAPS TO YOU KNOW

00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:34.885
CONTROL THE VOTE OF THE CLASS

00:42:34.952 --> 00:42:35.219
ALTOGETHER --

00:42:35.286 --> 00:42:36.820
SO THERE ARE SOME SAFEGUARDS

00:42:36.887 --> 00:42:38.923
BUILT INTO AND IT THE IT'S NOT

00:42:38.989 --> 00:42:40.157
AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS.

00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:41.225
I MEAN I THINK THE ROUTES FOR

00:42:41.292 --> 00:42:42.559
THE DEBTOR TO GET FROM HERE TO

00:42:42.626 --> 00:42:44.328
THERE WILL BE CHALLENGING THANK

00:42:44.395 --> 00:42:44.962
YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE

00:42:45.029 --> 00:42:46.330
CLARIFICATION FINAL QUESTION IS

00:42:46.397 --> 00:42:50.601
THE ISSUE OF BANKRUPTCY WHEN --

00:42:50.668 --> 00:42:52.836
YOU HAVE --

00:42:52.903 --> 00:42:54.571
NUMBER OF ASSETS YOUR NUMBER

00:42:54.638 --> 00:42:56.073
LIABILITIES OBVIOUSLY THE

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.007
LIABILITY TO SEE THE ASSETS SO

00:42:57.074 --> 00:42:58.375
THAT EVERYBODY GETS A LITTLE

00:42:58.442 --> 00:42:59.710
HAIR CUT IN THE PROCESS IS

00:42:59.777 --> 00:43:00.311
YOU'VE EXPLAINED.

00:43:00.377 --> 00:43:01.578
BUT LET'S SAY THE AT THE END OF

00:43:01.645 --> 00:43:04.181
THE REORGANIZATION BOND HOLDERS

00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:04.982
FIFTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR

00:43:05.049 --> 00:43:08.852
VICTIMS GET FIFTY CENTS ON THE

00:43:08.919 --> 00:43:10.187
DOLLAR IS THERE A A POSSIBILITY

00:43:10.254 --> 00:43:13.524
IN THAT BANKRUPTCY. TO THEN MAKE

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:14.191
THOSE.

00:43:14.258 --> 00:43:16.794
VICTIMS AS A FIRE VICTIMS IN

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.062
THIS CASE FULL.

00:43:18.128 --> 00:43:19.363
OVER A PERIOD OF TIME AFTER AS

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:21.332
PART OF THE REORGANIZATION --

00:43:21.398 --> 00:43:23.267
AFTER THE BANKRUPTCY AND AFTER

00:43:23.334 --> 00:43:24.635
THEY COME OUT OF BANKRUPTCY TO

00:43:24.702 --> 00:43:26.904
THERE COULD BE A PLAN AIMED

00:43:26.971 --> 00:43:28.505
STRUCTURE GOING FORWARD.

00:43:28.572 --> 00:43:30.741
THERE COULD BE SO --

00:43:30.808 --> 00:43:31.775
THAT WOULD BE A POLICY CHOICE

00:43:31.842 --> 00:43:33.377
THE P. JEANNIE WANTS TO MAKE SO

00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:35.145
PEACHY WANTED TO IT IS POSSIBLE

00:43:35.212 --> 00:43:38.015
TO HAVE A A PLAN WHERE YOU YOU

00:43:38.082 --> 00:43:41.885
GIVE PEOPLE PERHAPS P. JEANNIE

00:43:41.952 --> 00:43:43.587
AGREES DOWN THE LINE SO WHICH

00:43:43.654 --> 00:43:44.355
WOULD GIVE THEM IS.

00:43:44.421 --> 00:43:46.056
CASH UP FRONT PLUS A PROMISE TO

00:43:46.123 --> 00:43:47.858
PAY THEM MORE OVER THE FUTURE ON

00:43:47.925 --> 00:43:49.360
IN THAT COULD BE A PROMISE TO

00:43:49.426 --> 00:43:51.261
MAKE THEM WHOLE INCLUDING WITH

00:43:51.328 --> 00:43:52.629
INTEREST IF THEY WANT TO TELL.

00:43:52.696 --> 00:43:54.365
THAT'S A CHOICE THE P. JEANNIE

00:43:54.431 --> 00:43:55.966
WOULD HAVE TO MAKE ON IN

00:43:56.033 --> 00:43:56.867
PRACTICE --

00:43:56.934 --> 00:43:58.402
CHOICES LIKE THAT ARE RELATIVELY

00:43:58.469 --> 00:44:00.170
UNCOMMON CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY

00:44:00.237 --> 00:44:01.205
BECAUSE IT WOULD CREATE A

00:44:01.271 --> 00:44:03.007
PROBLEM WILL BE CALLED THAT

00:44:03.073 --> 00:44:04.541
OVERHANG WE'RE P. JEANNIE WOULD

00:44:04.608 --> 00:44:06.710
BE SO BUSY IN --

00:44:06.777 --> 00:44:07.244
TWENTY TWENTY OUT WE KNOW

00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:07.911
THEY'RE OUT OF BANKRUPTCY LET'S

00:44:07.978 --> 00:44:10.014
SAY PAYING FOR THE PAST WILD

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.715
FIRE VICTIMS THAT MAYBE THEY

00:44:11.782 --> 00:44:13.350
DON'T HAVE ROOM THAN TO PAY NEW

00:44:13.417 --> 00:44:14.985
WILDFIRE VICTIMS TO THE EXTENT

00:44:15.052 --> 00:44:16.787
THAT THEY BECAUSE NEW DAMAGES OR

00:44:16.854 --> 00:44:17.688
MAYBE THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME

00:44:17.755 --> 00:44:19.890
CAPACITY TO INVEST IN SAFETY.

00:44:19.957 --> 00:44:20.824
SO -- IT'S

00:44:20.891 --> 00:44:22.960
POSSIBLE THEY COULD CHOOSE TO DO

00:44:23.027 --> 00:44:24.028
THAT BUT I THINK IN ORDER FOR

00:44:24.094 --> 00:44:25.763
JUDGE MENTALITY TO APPROVE THAT

DOING THAT RIGHT NOW --

00:46:41.965 --> 00:46:43.333
ALONG WITH HIS LAW CLERKS AND

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.536
PROBABLY HAS ALREADY GOTTEN

00:46:45.602 --> 00:46:46.136
THERE AND THE PARTIES TO THE

00:46:46.203 --> 00:46:48.272
CASE WILL HELP HIM IF YOU LOOK

00:46:48.338 --> 00:46:50.040
AT THE BANKRUPTCY DOCKET WHAT

00:46:50.107 --> 00:46:52.009
YOU SEE IS A LOT OF EFFORTS.

00:46:52.075 --> 00:46:53.710
ON THE PART OF THE COMPANY AND

00:46:53.777 --> 00:46:55.913
BY CREDITORS TO TRY TO EXPLAIN

00:46:55.979 --> 00:46:57.714
TO THE JUDGE EXACTLY WHAT'S

00:46:57.781 --> 00:46:58.982
GOING ON SO HE HAS THAT PRIOR

00:46:59.049 --> 00:47:00.851
KNOWLEDGE TO BRING TO BEAR --

00:47:00.918 --> 00:47:01.818
AND THEN RIGHT NOW I'M SURE HE

00:47:01.885 --> 00:47:04.922
IS DELVING BACK INTO THE DETAILS --

00:47:04.988 --> 00:47:06.323
SO HE'S READY TO ROLL BUT I

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:07.457
DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYBODY OUT

00:47:07.524 --> 00:47:09.126
THERE WHO'S CONCERNS THAT IT'S

00:47:09.193 --> 00:47:10.160
GOING TO TAKE C&lt;c.cyan&gt; MONTHS TO&lt;/c&gt;

00:47:10.227 --> 00:47:12.930
RAMP UP AND UNDERSTANDING THIS

00:47:12.996 --> 00:47:13.964
IS THE BUSINESS THESE ARE THE

00:47:14.031 --> 00:47:14.298
ISSUES.

00:47:14.364 --> 00:47:15.999
HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO MATTER

00:47:16.066 --> 00:47:19.069
BECAUSE HE DOES HAVE EXPERIENCE

00:47:19.136 --> 00:47:20.637
HAVING PRESIDED AT THE UTILITY --

00:47:20.704 --> 00:47:23.073
THE BANKRUPTCY OF A YOU KNOW

00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:24.775
PUBLIC PRIVATE UTILITY.

00:47:24.841 --> 00:47:26.410
THE MAYBE WHAT'S NEW IN THE

00:47:26.476 --> 00:47:28.412
TWENTY YEARS IS RENEWABLES.

00:47:28.478 --> 00:47:30.013
AND THOSE CONTRACTS AND SO YOU

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:30.914
YOU.

00:47:30.981 --> 00:47:34.384
MENTION THAT HE COULD.

00:47:34.451 --> 00:47:35.819
CANCEL ALL THOSE CONTRACTS IS

00:47:35.886 --> 00:47:38.021
THAT CORRECT I'M HE MAY HAVE THE

00:47:38.088 --> 00:47:38.922
POWER TO DO SO AGAIN IT'S

00:47:38.989 --> 00:47:40.591
UNCLEAR AS A MATTER OF LAW

00:47:40.657 --> 00:47:42.526
WHETHER HE CAN --

00:47:42.593 --> 00:47:43.994
MY GAS IS THAT HIS POSITION I'M

00:47:44.061 --> 00:47:45.829
I'M SPECULATING HERE BUT IN

00:47:45.896 --> 00:47:47.231
GENERAL WHEN BANKRUPTCY JUDGES

00:47:47.297 --> 00:47:49.166
RUN INTO FEDERAL REGULATORS TO

00:47:49.233 --> 00:47:50.601
TELL THEM TEY DON'T HAVE THE

00:47:50.667 --> 00:47:51.668
POWER TO DO THINGS.

00:47:51.735 --> 00:47:52.803
ON THE TREND IS FOR BANKRUPTCY

00:47:52.869 --> 00:47:55.038
JUDGES TO ALWAYS SAY NO WE DO

00:47:55.105 --> 00:47:56.006
HAVE THE POWER TO DO THINGS

00:47:56.073 --> 00:47:57.174
QUESTION I THINK ALL OF US CAN

00:47:57.241 --> 00:47:58.875
UNDERSTAND TO SOME EXTENT --

00:47:58.942 --> 00:48:00.210
SO I WOULD EXPECT HIM TO TAKE

00:48:00.277 --> 00:48:01.612
THAT POSITION AND I WOULD EXPECT

00:48:01.678 --> 00:48:03.347
ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW THE JUST

00:48:03.413 --> 00:48:05.849
RECORDED THE NINTH CIRCUIT TO

00:48:05.916 --> 00:48:07.584
HAVE TO RESOLVE THAT QUESTION --

00:48:07.651 --> 00:48:08.252
BUT I WOULD EXPECT THAT TO BE

00:48:08.318 --> 00:48:10.187
APPEALED AND YES THAT'S ONE OF

00:48:10.254 --> 00:48:11.622
THE THINGS THIS CHANGE --

00:48:11.688 --> 00:48:12.422
ALSO I THINK THERE'S BEEN GROWTH

00:48:12.489 --> 00:48:13.957
AMONG COMMUNITY POWER

00:48:14.024 --> 00:48:15.058
AGGREGATORS AND OTHER.

00:48:15.125 --> 00:48:16.660
THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENCE NOW

00:48:16.727 --> 00:48:17.761
SO IT'S NOT QUITE THE SAME

00:48:17.828 --> 00:48:19.129
BUSINESS THE WORLD HAS CHANGED

00:48:19.196 --> 00:48:20.264
AND OBVIOUSLY NOT THE SAME

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:23.467
PREDICATE FACT PATTERN THAT

00:48:23.533 --> 00:48:23.934
DROVE THE COMPANY INTO

00:48:24.001 --> 00:48:25.969
BANKRUPTCY.

00:48:47.824 --> 00:48:49.259
MY MY MAIN CONCERN IS FOR THE

00:48:49.326 --> 00:48:50.027

HOW WE CAN ASSURE OUR?

00:48:57.701 --> 00:48:59.569

IS GONNA CONTINUE BASICALLY SAID

00:49:04.241 --> 00:49:04.975
IN CHAPTER.

00:49:05.042 --> 00:49:07.110
ELEVEN MOST OF THE CONSUMERS ARE

00:49:07.177 --> 00:49:09.279
NOT GOING TO NOTICE --

00:49:09.346 --> 00:49:11.882
DIFFERENCE.

00:49:11.948 --> 00:49:13.083
BUT AND I ALL I KNOW THAT

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:16.687
THERE'S ALSO A A NEXUS TO THE PC.

00:49:16.753 --> 00:49:19.656

00:49:19.723 --> 00:49:22.125
THE PC IS GOING TO BE THE ONES

00:49:22.192 --> 00:49:22.859
THAT ARE GOING TO DETERMINE

00:49:22.926 --> 00:49:23.994
WHETHER OUT THERE CAN BE ANY

00:49:24.061 --> 00:49:25.796

WELL BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS YES

00:49:55.692 --> 00:49:57.094
THAT THEY CAN AND THAT THAT'S

00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:58.628
SOMETHING THAT OFTEN HAPPENS IN

00:49:58.695 --> 00:50:00.731
UTILITY BANKRUPTCIES THERE ARE.

00:50:00.797 --> 00:50:01.965
RATE INCREASES THAT THAT

00:50:02.032 --> 00:50:02.799
AFFECTION WITH A SETTLEMENT AT

00:50:02.866 --> 00:50:04.668
THE ENDS BECAUSE TO SOME EXTENT

00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:05.535
IF YOU THINK OF THE BARGAINING

00:50:05.602 --> 00:50:07.437
TABLE AS BEING YOU KNOW THESE

00:50:07.504 --> 00:50:09.172

RATEPAYERS AREN'T AT THE TABLE --

00:50:11.575 --> 00:50:12.376

LIKE COME UP WITH A PLAN THAT

00:50:13.944 --> 00:50:15.579
INVOLVES SOMEBODY ELSE KICKING

00:50:15.645 --> 00:50:16.213
IN MONEY TO MAKE EVERYBODY HAPPY

WE HAVE ALSO SEEN IT'D BEEN A

00:50:29.493 --> 00:50:30.060
SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT NUMBER

00:50:30.127 --> 00:50:30.827
OF CLAIMS AND I WOULD IMAGINE

00:50:30.894 --> 00:50:31.194
THAT.

00:50:31.261 --> 00:50:32.462
PROBABLY SOME OF THE LARGEST

00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:33.697
PLAINTIFFS --

00:50:33.764 --> 00:50:36.600
SUING OUR INSURANCE COMPANIES

00:50:36.666 --> 00:50:37.067
THAT --

00:50:37.134 --> 00:50:38.835
ATTEMPT TO SUBJUGATE DIDN'T

00:50:38.902 --> 00:50:40.203
RECOVER COSTS FOR A NUMBER OF

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:43.039
STRUCTURES THAT HAVE BEEN --

00:50:43.106 --> 00:50:44.207
LOST CAM CAN THIS JUDGE YOU'D

00:50:44.274 --> 00:50:45.442
LOOK UNILATERALLY CAN HE

00:50:45.509 --> 00:50:47.344
DISMISSED CLAIMS TO THE EXTENT

00:50:47.411 --> 00:50:49.212
THAT HE CAN PROTECT THE

00:50:49.279 --> 00:50:51.815
VIABILITY OF THIS COMPANY --

00:50:51.882 --> 00:50:54.184
AT THE EXPENSE OF THESE THESE

00:50:54.251 --> 00:50:58.955
INSURANCE COMPANIES NOT FREE HE

00:50:59.022 --> 00:51:00.056
MADE WHOLE.

00:51:00.123 --> 00:51:01.892
SO ON WOULDN'T JUDGMENT TALLY

00:51:01.958 --> 00:51:02.759
WOULDN'T HAVE THE POWER TO

00:51:02.826 --> 00:51:03.994
DISMISS A CLAIM IF HE FELT THAT

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:05.095
THE COMPANY NEEDED THIS CLAIM

00:51:05.162 --> 00:51:05.929
THIS MESS --

00:51:05.996 --> 00:51:07.097
IN PART BECAUSE BANKRUPTCY LAW

00:51:07.164 --> 00:51:08.932
DOESN'T REQUIRE THIS SO THE

00:51:08.999 --> 00:51:10.467
PEOPLE WITH PRE BANKRUPTCY

00:51:10.534 --> 00:51:11.935
CLAIMS THEY'RE JUST FIGHTING

00:51:12.002 --> 00:51:12.702
OVER THE POOL OF ASSETS THAT'S

00:51:12.769 --> 00:51:14.438
THERE TO THE EXTENT THAT NO

00:51:14.504 --> 00:51:16.139
THEIR CLAIMS EXCEED THE POOL OF

00:51:16.206 --> 00:51:17.174
ASSETS MEANING THEY WON'T BE

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.675
PAID IN FULL.

00:51:18.742 --> 00:51:19.776
IT'S REALLY A RELEVANCE TO

00:51:19.843 --> 00:51:21.478
WEATHER P. GENIES CAPABLE

00:51:21.545 --> 00:51:23.380
REORGANIZING AND SO ON JUDGE

00:51:23.447 --> 00:51:25.148
MENTALITY DOES HAVE THE OPTION

00:51:25.215 --> 00:51:26.883
OF USING DIFFERENT ESTIMATION

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:28.685
METHODS DETERMINE WHETHER CLAIMS

00:51:28.752 --> 00:51:30.187
ARE VIABLE IF HE WANTS TO

00:51:30.253 --> 00:51:31.221
ENACTED COLOR.

00:51:31.288 --> 00:51:33.890
THE OUTCOMES FOR DIFFERENT

00:51:33.957 --> 00:51:36.893
PLAYERS MOVE BECAUSE THIS

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:37.494
COMPANY CAN LEAVE BANKRUPTCY

00:51:37.561 --> 00:51:39.429
EVEN IF.

00:51:39.496 --> 00:51:41.164
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE MADE WHOLE.

00:51:41.231 --> 00:51:43.733
SO IT IS IT'S BEEN ALLEGED THAT --

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.869
THIS PARTICULAR COMPANY WAS

00:51:45.936 --> 00:51:47.504
NEGLIGENT AND AND PROTECTING

00:51:47.571 --> 00:51:49.406
THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE --

00:51:49.473 --> 00:51:51.441
CAUSING SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS.

00:51:51.508 --> 00:51:52.909
DOES THE BANKRUPTCY JUDGE --

00:51:52.976 --> 00:51:55.812
HAVE AN ABILITY TO TO MANDATE --

00:51:55.879 --> 00:51:57.714
THAT THIS COMPANY IF THEY'RE

00:51:57.781 --> 00:52:00.016
ABLE TO EMERGE FROM CHAPTER --

00:52:00.083 --> 00:52:01.451
ELEVEN MITIGATE ANY FUTURE

00:52:01.518 --> 00:52:03.987
DAMAGE BY FOLLOWING STATE LAW

00:52:04.054 --> 00:52:05.922
AND MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES

00:52:05.989 --> 00:52:07.858
UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE IN A

00:52:07.924 --> 00:52:09.025
NEW AN ABNORMAL.

00:52:09.092 --> 00:52:11.361
THE FIRES ARE EXPECTED TO BE

00:52:11.428 --> 00:52:12.629
MORE PREVALENT.

00:52:12.696 --> 00:52:14.030
AND THAT THEY NEED TO DO A

00:52:14.097 --> 00:52:15.232
BETTER JOB OF PROTECTING

00:52:15.298 --> 00:52:17.000
THEMSELVES BECAUSE WE'RE COMING

00:52:17.067 --> 00:52:18.502
INTO A VERY RAINY YEAR THIS YEAR

00:52:18.568 --> 00:52:20.570
WHICH MEANS WE CAN HAVE A LOT OF

00:52:20.637 --> 00:52:20.804
FIRE --

00:52:20.871 --> 00:52:21.905
FUELS.

00:52:21.972 --> 00:52:23.740
AND WE COULD BE BACK HERE AGAIN

00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:26.476
NEXT YEAR GOD FOR BID --

00:52:26.543 --> 00:52:29.779
WITH WITH MORE FIRES IF BY THE

00:52:29.846 --> 00:52:32.282
UTILITY.

00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:33.817
TO MEDICAID FURTHER DAMAGE.

00:52:33.884 --> 00:52:34.851
YES SO --

00:52:34.918 --> 00:52:36.786
JUDGMENT HOLLY DOES HAVE THAT

00:52:36.853 --> 00:52:38.755
POWER IN DIRECTLY NO ONE WAY TO

00:52:38.822 --> 00:52:39.923
THINK ABOUT WITH THE BANKRUPTCY

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:41.892
JUDGE RIGHT NOW IS IS THAT HE'S

00:52:41.958 --> 00:52:43.126
KIND OF LIKE YOU KNOW THE GOD OF

00:52:43.193 --> 00:52:44.928
P. JEANNIE HE HAS ALL POWER OVER

00:52:44.995 --> 00:52:46.096
THEM IS LIKE A ONE PERSON

00:52:46.162 --> 00:52:47.264
REGULATOR.

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:48.131
WHO CAN DO A LOT OF WHAT HE

00:52:48.198 --> 00:52:49.332
WANTS BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT

00:52:49.399 --> 00:52:50.934
PROVISIONS OF THE BANKRUPTCY

00:52:51.001 --> 00:52:51.968
CODE THAT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO

00:52:52.035 --> 00:52:54.304
MAKE WHATEVER ORDER HE WANTED TO

00:52:54.371 --> 00:52:54.471
GO?

00:52:54.538 --> 00:52:56.072
SO TO THE EXTENT YOU KNOW WITHIN

00:52:56.139 --> 00:52:57.574
REASON OBVIOUSLY SO TO THE

00:52:57.641 --> 00:52:59.175
EXTENT OF THAT --

00:52:59.242 --> 00:53:00.810
YOU KNOW HE WERE TO DECIDE THE

00:53:00.877 --> 00:53:02.212
P. GENIE IS BOB P. JEANNIE WILL

00:53:02.279 --> 00:53:03.580
HAVE TO PROMISE TO OBEY STATE

00:53:03.647 --> 00:53:04.781
LAWS TO GET A PLAN OF

00:53:04.848 --> 00:53:06.750
ORGANIZATION APPROVED OKAY --

00:53:06.816 --> 00:53:08.118
INTO THE SENSE THAT YOU KNOW IF

00:53:08.184 --> 00:53:09.152
YOU WERE TO SAY WHAT HE NEEDS

00:53:09.219 --> 00:53:10.186
NOT FEASIBLE UNLESS THEY MAKE

00:53:10.253 --> 00:53:12.589
MONSTER INVESTMENTS AND SAFETY.

00:53:12.656 --> 00:53:13.890
YOU KNOW THAT'S A CHOICE YOU CAN

00:53:13.957 --> 00:53:14.991
MAKE IN THAT CHOICE PROBABLY

00:53:15.058 --> 00:53:17.561
REDIRECTS VALUE FROM PRE

00:53:17.627 --> 00:53:19.329
BANKRUPTCY CREDITORS TO P.

00:53:19.396 --> 00:53:21.264
JEANNIE SAFETY INVESTMENTS OKAY

00:53:21.331 --> 00:53:25.502
MY FINAL QUESTION IS.

00:53:25.569 --> 00:53:26.803
EXPLAIN A SCENARIO.

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:27.637
WHERE P. JEANNIE WOULD HAVE NO

00:53:27.704 --> 00:53:28.204
CHOICE BUT TO GO TO CHAPTER

00:53:28.271 --> 00:53:29.973
ELEVEN WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN?

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.042
FOR THE DELIVERANCE OF

00:53:32.108 --> 00:53:35.712
ELECTRICITY AND THE FUTURE OF

00:53:35.779 --> 00:53:37.047
PROVIDING UTILITIES ELECTRICAL

00:53:37.113 --> 00:53:38.949
UTILITY SERVICES OF THE STATE OF

00:53:39.015 --> 00:53:39.249
CALIFORNIA.

00:53:39.316 --> 00:53:41.084
I MEAN IF THEY WERE TO HAVE TO

00:53:41.151 --> 00:53:42.852
GO TO CHAPTER ELEVEN AGAIN NOT

00:53:42.919 --> 00:53:44.854
THEY WERE TO GO TO CHAPTERS --

00:53:44.921 --> 00:53:47.657
SINCE AFTER SEVEN YEAH WHAT AS

00:53:47.724 --> 00:53:50.894
SEVEN TOP TIMING BUT HOW WOULD

00:53:50.961 --> 00:53:52.729
PROCEED TO CHAPTER SEVEN COULD

00:53:52.796 --> 00:53:54.397
PROCEED TO CHAPTER SEVEN IF A

00:53:54.464 --> 00:53:55.599
COULD HOW WITH THAT.

00:53:55.665 --> 00:53:57.367
WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE SO --

00:53:57.434 --> 00:53:59.135
AS A MATTER OF LAW IT IS

00:53:59.202 --> 00:54:01.972
POSSIBLE EITHER A A MOTION COULD

00:54:02.038 --> 00:54:02.906
BE FOUND FOR THE JUDGE COULD

00:54:02.973 --> 00:54:04.808
ORDER THE CONVERSION OF THE CASE

00:54:04.874 --> 00:54:06.142
TO CHAPTER.

00:54:06.209 --> 00:54:07.911
SEVEN IN PRACTICE I THINK THAT'S

00:54:07.978 --> 00:54:10.547
ALMOST A 100% UNLIKELY IF THAT

00:54:10.614 --> 00:54:12.849
WERE TO HAPPEN WHAT YOU WOULD

00:54:12.916 --> 00:54:14.784
HAVE WOULD BE SALES OF P. GENIES

00:54:14.851 --> 00:54:16.686
ASSETS I WOULD ASSUME THERE LIKE

00:54:16.753 --> 00:54:17.420
TRICITY ASSETS.

00:54:17.487 --> 00:54:19.189
AND I ASSUME THE BUYERS WOULD BE

00:54:19.255 --> 00:54:21.091
OTHER PUBLIC UTILITIES ON IN

00:54:21.157 --> 00:54:23.326
PRACTICE I I WOULD HAVE TO

00:54:23.393 --> 00:54:24.361
IMAGINE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF

00:54:24.427 --> 00:54:25.695
THE CAN SPEECH ANY CONSUMER AND

00:54:25.762 --> 00:54:27.297
I'M A P. JEANNIE CONSUMER.

00:54:27.364 --> 00:54:28.632
WE WOULDN'T NOTICE ANY OF THIS

00:54:28.698 --> 00:54:30.634
TO BE LIKE IN SOME FAR OFF LANDS

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:31.868
THE OWNERSHIP THE P. JEANNIE

00:54:31.935 --> 00:54:33.169
ASSETS WITH CHANGING HANDS AND

00:54:33.236 --> 00:54:34.604
EVENTUALLY START GETTING BILL BY

00:54:34.671 --> 00:54:36.573
SOMEBODY ELSE --

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:37.474
BUT YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S AND

00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:39.509
IT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY THING TO

00:54:39.576 --> 00:54:41.277
HAVE HAPPEN JUDGMENT HOLLY WOULD

00:54:41.344 --> 00:54:43.079
BE EXTRAORDINARILY UNLIKELY TO

00:54:43.146 --> 00:54:44.881
ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN --

00:54:44.948 --> 00:54:46.416
BECAUSE IN CHAPTER ELEVEN THERE

00:54:46.483 --> 00:54:47.384
ARE CHECKS AND SAFEGUARDS TO

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:48.785
MAKE IT EASIER TO HAVE A MORE

00:54:48.852 --> 00:54:50.687
INCLUSIVE PROCESS OF DECISION

00:54:50.754 --> 00:54:52.822
MAKING AND TO HELP DECIDE WHAT

00:54:52.889 --> 00:54:58.795
WILL HAPPEN WITH THESE ASSETS.

00:54:58.862 --> 00:54:59.362
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY

00:54:59.429 --> 00:55:01.865
THANK YOU FOR A MINUTE.

00:55:01.931 --> 00:55:02.832
I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND

00:55:02.899 --> 00:55:03.433
THANK YOU PROFESSOR FOR BEING

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:04.868
HERE -- WHAT

00:55:04.934 --> 00:55:06.002
DID YOU TO DRILL DOWN A COUPLE

00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:08.905
POINTS YOU RAISED --

00:55:08.972 --> 00:55:12.375
ON THIS JURISDICTIONAL QUESTION --

00:55:12.442 --> 00:55:15.311
OF A BANKRUPTCY VERSUS BURKE I

00:55:15.378 --> 00:55:16.846
KNOW THERE'S SORT OF SPLIT

00:55:16.913 --> 00:55:18.648
CIRCUIT OPINIONS TO SOUTHERN

00:55:18.715 --> 00:55:19.249
DISTRICT OF NEW YORK WENT ONE

00:55:19.315 --> 00:55:20.950
WAY.

00:55:21.017 --> 00:55:22.352
IN THE THIRD THE FIFTH ONE

00:55:22.419 --> 00:55:24.087
ANOTHER WAY.

00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:26.923
NOW THE NINTH.

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.557
WILL.

00:55:27.624 --> 00:55:28.992
IN THEORY WEIGH IN AT SOME POINT

00:55:29.059 --> 00:55:30.493
SOON -- DO

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:32.529
YOU SEE THIS THEN I DON'T KNOW

00:55:32.595 --> 00:55:35.198
IF THERES OTHER PENDING CASES

00:55:35.265 --> 00:55:35.965
GOING ON AROUND THE COUNTRY BUT

00:55:36.032 --> 00:55:36.933
DO YOU SEE THIS GOOD.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.168
JURISDICTION JUST I MEAN THREE

00:55:38.234 --> 00:55:39.235
QUARTERS DIRECT JURISDICTION

00:55:39.302 --> 00:55:40.870
OVER FEDERAL QUESTION LIKE THIS.

00:55:40.937 --> 00:55:42.072
COULD YOU SEE THIS GETTING

00:55:42.138 --> 00:55:44.307
APPEALED THERE AND IF SO.

00:55:44.374 --> 00:55:45.542
JUST WALK US THROUGH THAT TIME

00:55:45.608 --> 00:55:45.742
LINE.

00:55:45.809 --> 00:55:47.877
SO IT IS IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

00:55:47.944 --> 00:55:49.212
THIS COULD REACH THE SUPREME

00:55:49.279 --> 00:55:51.247
COURT'S BECAUSE LIKE YOU SAID

00:55:51.314 --> 00:55:52.649
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION.

00:55:52.716 --> 00:55:53.483
I'M I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:54.984
CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS ARE OUT

00:55:55.051 --> 00:55:55.785
THERE BUT THEY'RE CERTAINLY

00:55:55.852 --> 00:55:58.288
NUMBER BANKRUPTCY COURTS AND I

00:55:58.354 --> 00:55:59.889
AM THAT HAVE WEIGHED IN ON THIS

00:55:59.956 --> 00:56:00.924
BUT THERE'S NOTHING THAT IS

00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:03.626
BINDING ON THIS PROCESS --

00:56:03.693 --> 00:56:05.161
IN PRACTICE YOU COULD SEE

00:56:05.228 --> 00:56:06.029
APPEALS ALL THE WAY TO THE

00:56:06.096 --> 00:56:07.197
SUPREME COURT'S NOW YOU'RE

00:56:07.263 --> 00:56:09.499
TALKING ABOUT AN APPEAL PROCESS

00:56:09.566 --> 00:56:11.768
THAT TAKES YEARS --

00:56:11.835 --> 00:56:14.237
YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT THE

00:56:14.304 --> 00:56:15.805
NINETY FINAL WORD ON BECAUSE

00:56:15.872 --> 00:56:17.240
PRACTICALLY THE WAY BANKRUPTCY

00:56:17.307 --> 00:56:19.375
APPEALS TENDS TO WORK IS --

00:56:19.442 --> 00:56:22.445
QUESTIONS CAN BECOME MOOT OR NOT

00:56:22.512 --> 00:56:24.013
YOU KNOW THAT AND IT'S LITTLE

00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:24.581
MORE COMPLICATED HERE IN THE

00:56:24.647 --> 00:56:26.216
NINTH CIRCUIT --

00:56:26.282 --> 00:56:28.017
BUT QUESTIONS CAN BECOME MOOT TO

00:56:28.084 --> 00:56:28.585
CAN BECOME HARDER TO APPEAL

00:56:28.651 --> 00:56:29.686
THINGS --

00:56:29.753 --> 00:56:31.821
BUT IT'S RATE RELATIVELY UNUSUAL

00:56:31.888 --> 00:56:35.759
pSUPREME COURT THIS COULD HAPPEN --

00:56:35.825 --> 00:56:36.593
BUT YET THEN YOU'RE TALKING

00:56:36.659 --> 00:56:37.994
ABOUT A YEAR YOU KNOW A COUPLE

00:56:38.061 --> 00:56:39.963
YEARS OF LITIGATION AND THAT

00:56:40.029 --> 00:56:40.396
SEEMS.

00:56:40.463 --> 00:56:42.298
LESS LIKELY IT DOESN'T QUITE

00:56:42.365 --> 00:56:43.833
SYNC UP WITH THE EXCLUSIVITY

00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:45.602
PERIOD EITHER WRITING THEORY

00:56:45.668 --> 00:56:47.871
THAT WOULD ECLIPSE THAT THE

00:56:47.937 --> 00:56:49.706
EXCLUSIVITY IF IT DID GET.

00:56:49.773 --> 00:56:51.875
IT WHAT IT WHERE YOU GOT STATE

00:56:51.941 --> 00:56:54.043
LEADERS I MEAN IF THE NINTH

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:55.712
CIRCUIT.

00:56:55.779 --> 00:56:57.113
IT WOULDN'T FOOD INTAKE AFFECT

00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:59.649
IN OTHER WORDS.

00:56:59.716 --> 00:57:01.251
ALSO IMAGINE THAT WHAT P.

00:57:01.317 --> 00:57:02.085
JEANNIE WILL DO IS THEY'LL

00:57:02.152 --> 00:57:03.820
THREATEN TO TEAR UP CONTRACTS

00:57:03.887 --> 00:57:04.454
MAYBE THE FILE MOTIONS TO TEAR

00:57:04.521 --> 00:57:05.121
THEM UP AND BUT IF THEY'RE ABLE

00:57:05.188 --> 00:57:06.422
TO REACH NEGOTIATED RESOLUTIONS

00:57:06.489 --> 00:57:07.490
WITH THE COUNTERPARTIES ON THE

00:57:07.557 --> 00:57:09.325
OTHER SIDE MAYBE.

00:57:09.392 --> 00:57:10.426
FOR YOU KNOW RIGHT I DON'T KNOW

00:57:10.493 --> 00:57:11.861
RIGHT -- SO

00:57:11.928 --> 00:57:14.631
THANK YOU FOR THAT OTHER

00:57:14.697 --> 00:57:16.800
QUESTION IS ABOUT --

00:57:16.866 --> 00:57:18.501
ELABORATING FURTHER ON THE

00:57:18.568 --> 00:57:19.068
FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS I KNOW

00:57:19.135 --> 00:57:21.037
THERE'S A MULTI FACTOR TEST THE

00:57:21.104 --> 00:57:22.338
FEASIBILITY IS ONE OF MANY.

00:57:22.405 --> 00:57:23.439
THERE'S ALSO THE BEST INTEREST

00:57:23.506 --> 00:57:25.241
TEST WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO

00:57:25.308 --> 00:57:26.576
CONSIDER WHETHER YOU'RE.

00:57:26.643 --> 00:57:29.646
LOOKING AT THE THE RELATIVE

00:57:29.712 --> 00:57:31.681
VALUE PURSES FULL LIQUIDATION OF

00:57:31.748 --> 00:57:36.452
WHICH IT JUST WONDERING HOW.

00:57:36.519 --> 00:57:37.854
WHAT MAKES YOU BELIEVE THAT FEES

00:57:37.921 --> 00:57:39.489
ABILITIES ARE TO REQUIRES A

00:57:39.556 --> 00:57:42.392
MULTI YEAR SOLUTION JUST LOOKING

00:57:42.458 --> 00:57:44.027
AT PRESIDENT THERE CAN YOU

00:57:44.093 --> 00:57:45.028
ELABORATE ON THAT?

00:57:45.094 --> 00:57:46.896
SO THE WAY THAT REQUIREMENTS HAS

00:57:46.963 --> 00:57:48.364
TYPICALLY BEEN INTERPRETED BY

00:57:48.431 --> 00:57:50.600
THE COURTS IT'S REQUIRES A

00:57:50.667 --> 00:57:52.902
FINDING FROM THE JUDGE THAT --

00:57:52.969 --> 00:57:55.572
THIS BANKRUPTCY IS UNLIKE OTHER

00:57:55.638 --> 00:57:57.006
BANKRUPTCY AND OBVIOUSLY YOU

00:57:57.073 --> 00:57:58.842
CAN'T PREDICT THE FUTURE SO IN A

00:57:58.908 --> 00:58:00.577
PREDICTIONS ANY YEAR A MUCH MORE

00:58:00.643 --> 00:58:02.779
RELIABLE THAN PREDICTIONS IN.%

00:58:02.846 --> 00:58:04.247
TEN YEARS OR SO IT TENDS TO BE

00:58:04.314 --> 00:58:05.615
AN ANALYSIS FOR THE JUDGE LOOKS

00:58:05.682 --> 00:58:08.985
AT IT AND IT'S ANALYSIS LIKE KILL

00:58:09.052 --> 00:58:11.020
HAVE NUMBERS IN FRONT OF HIM.

00:58:11.087 --> 00:58:12.755
BUT IT'S A DO I THINK BASED ON

00:58:12.822 --> 00:58:14.324
WITH THIS COMPANIES PROPOSING

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:15.325
THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO GO BACK

00:58:15.391 --> 00:58:16.893
INTO BANKRUPTCY AGAIN AND

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:17.560
RECENTLY YOU'RE SEEING A NUMBER

00:58:17.627 --> 00:58:19.395
OF RETAILERS WE'RE GOING INTO

00:58:19.462 --> 00:58:20.663
BANKRUPTCY COMING OUT AND FILING

00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:22.065
AGAIN IMMEDIATELY.

00:58:22.131 --> 00:58:23.566
AND THERE THE JUDGE JUST MADE A

00:58:23.633 --> 00:58:25.134
JUDGMENT CLL THAT THIS COMPANY

00:58:25.201 --> 00:58:26.636
IS LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE

00:58:26.703 --> 00:58:29.105
AND WAS PROVEN NOT TO BE TRUE.

00:58:29.172 --> 00:58:30.740
SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT SOMETHING

00:58:30.807 --> 00:58:33.142
LIKE THAT COULD HAPPEN HERE BUT

00:58:33.209 --> 00:58:34.377
MY GUESS IS THE JUDGE MENTALITY

00:58:34.444 --> 00:58:36.946
WILL CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT

00:58:37.013 --> 00:58:38.481
FEASIBILITY AND MAKING SURE THE

00:58:38.548 --> 00:58:40.283
P. GENIE IS NOT LIKELY. TO GO

00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:41.584
BACK INTO BANKRUPTCY WHICH

00:58:41.651 --> 00:58:44.387
REQUIRE SOME SORT OF PLAN FOR

00:58:44.454 --> 00:58:45.989
FUTURE WILDFIRE LIABILITY.

00:58:46.055 --> 00:58:47.991
IN FINAL QUESTION BECAUSE GOING

00:58:48.057 --> 00:58:51.127
TO THAT OTHER FACTOR THAT BEST

00:58:51.194 --> 00:58:53.029
INTEREST TEST IS THE IS THE WORK

00:58:53.096 --> 00:58:53.696
GOING ON IN THE PUBLIC UTILITIES

00:58:53.763 --> 00:58:54.564
COMMISSION WHERE THEY'VE SORT OF

00:58:54.631 --> 00:58:57.634
PUT OUT THERE --

00:58:57.700 --> 00:58:59.102
I FORGET EXACTLY WITH THE FOR IF

00:58:59.168 --> 00:59:01.537
IT WAS A AYE AYE OR SOME SOME

00:59:01.604 --> 00:59:02.705
SOME ORDER.

00:59:02.772 --> 00:59:04.040
ABOUT LOOKING AT SORT OF THE

00:59:04.107 --> 00:59:06.376
GOVERNING STRUCTURES --

00:59:06.442 --> 00:59:08.044
OPTIONS WITHIN P. JEANNIE ARE

00:59:08.111 --> 00:59:09.946
HAVING MULTIPLE SMALLER

00:59:10.013 --> 00:59:12.048
UTILITIES POTENTIALLY.

00:59:12.115 --> 00:59:13.917
LOOK RETHINKING HOW THE THEY

00:59:13.983 --> 00:59:14.951
MANAGE GOVERNANCE A GAS AND

00:59:15.018 --> 00:59:16.452
ELECTRICITY DELIVERY AND THE

00:59:16.519 --> 00:59:18.054
WHOLESALE SIDE LIKE.

00:59:18.121 --> 00:59:20.056
DOES THAT ACTUALLY DOES THAT

00:59:20.123 --> 00:59:21.157
AFFECT.

00:59:21.224 --> 00:59:23.226
THEN THE BEST INTERESTS TESTER

00:59:23.293 --> 00:59:24.460
ANY OF THE SORT OF FACTORS THE

00:59:24.527 --> 00:59:25.461
JUDGE WILL BE LOOKING AT

00:59:25.528 --> 00:59:27.430
DEPENDING ON WHAT.

00:59:27.497 --> 00:59:29.933
HOW MUCH MORE FLESHED OUT THAT

00:59:29.999 --> 00:59:32.068
LIQUIDATION SCENARIO LOOKS FROM

00:59:32.135 --> 00:59:33.903
OUR REGULATORS REMOVED FROM US?

00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:35.138
EVERY WITH EIGHT DO THEY HAVE TO

00:59:35.204 --> 00:59:36.472
TAKE SOME OF THAT INTO ACCOUNT

00:59:36.539 --> 00:59:38.141
IN IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT WHAT

00:59:38.207 --> 00:59:42.345
THE THIRTY COMPARATIVE VALUES.

00:59:42.412 --> 00:59:43.746
SO ARE ARE YOU SPEAKING ABOUT A

00:59:43.813 --> 00:59:45.682
SITUATION WHERE P. JEANNIE COULD

00:59:45.748 --> 00:59:48.351
BE REDUCED INTO SMALLER PARTS

00:59:48.418 --> 00:59:50.019
YES YES --

00:59:50.086 --> 00:59:52.088
SO A SITUATION LIKE THAT ISN'T

00:59:52.155 --> 00:59:53.957
IMPOSSIBLE IT PROBABLY WOULDN'T

00:59:54.023 --> 00:59:56.392
BE DONE AS A LIQUIDATION IT

00:59:56.459 --> 00:59:58.461
WOULD BE MORE DONE AS AND SALE

00:59:58.528 --> 01:00:00.163
OF DIFFERENT ASSETS --

01:00:00.229 --> 01:00:01.631
WHICH IS IT BUT I MEAN IT SOUNDS

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:02.565
THE SAME AS A LIQUIDATION BUT A

01:00:02.632 --> 01:00:04.801
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT --

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:07.804
DO I THINK THAT THE JUDGE WOULD

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:08.371
IS ON THE TABLE I THINK THAT

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:12.442
HE'D HAVE.

01:00:12.508 --> 01:00:14.544
TO CENTER RUBIO.

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:15.712
YEAH I'M SORRY YES IN A RUDE.

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:16.846
GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR THE

01:00:16.913 --> 01:00:18.481
INFORMATION US I BELIEVE FIVE

01:00:18.548 --> 01:00:19.315
SENATORS DON'T SEND A IT'S A LOT

01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:20.350
OF INFORMATION COMING OUT AS

01:00:20.416 --> 01:00:21.617
JUST A LITTLE CURIOUS ABOUT THE

01:00:21.684 --> 01:00:23.453
AD HOC COMMITTEES I BELIEVE YOU

01:00:23.519 --> 01:00:24.620
MENTIONED.

01:00:24.687 --> 01:00:26.122
THERE WERE AGITATORS SO MY

01:00:26.189 --> 01:00:27.724
QUESTION TO YOU IS WHO MAKES UP

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:29.659
THESE GROUPS AND DO YOU

01:00:29.726 --> 01:00:30.493
ANTICIPATE THEY'RE GONNA BE

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.095
TRYING TO WORK THE BUILDING WORK

01:00:32.161 --> 01:00:34.497
THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD WE BE

01:00:34.564 --> 01:00:36.532
LOOKING OUT FOR THESE GROUPS --

01:00:36.599 --> 01:00:38.101
SO THE PRACTICE AMONG BANKRUPTCY

01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:39.936
LAWYERS IS THAT WHEN A COMPANY

01:00:40.003 --> 01:00:41.904
FALLS INTO FINANCIAL DISTRESS

01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:44.707
THE CREDITORS ORGANIZE AND THE

01:00:44.774 --> 01:00:45.942
PARTIES THE TEND TO ORGANIZE THE

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:47.310
CREDITORS.

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:48.511
ARE LAWYERS SO THERE IS A LAW

01:00:48.578 --> 01:00:49.812
FIRM IN NEW YORK FOR EXAMPLE

01:00:49.879 --> 01:00:52.015
THAT IS REPRESENTING THE AD HOC

01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:54.017
GROUP OF P. JEANNIE BOND HOLDERS

01:00:54.083 --> 01:00:55.385
AND I THINK THERE MIGHT BE OTHER

01:00:55.451 --> 01:00:57.387
LAW FIRMS REPRESENTING OTHER.

01:00:57.453 --> 01:00:59.255
AD HOC GROUPS OF P. JEANNIE BOND

01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:00.423
HOLDERS THAT MAYBE HAVE

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:01.991
FACTUALLY DIFFERENT SITUATIONS

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:03.893
MAY BE THEIR SMALLER VERSES ONE

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:06.629
IS A GROUP OF HEDGE FUNDS --

01:01:06.696 --> 01:01:08.064
YOU CAN THE SAID THAT IS HOW

01:01:08.131 --> 01:01:09.165
THEIR FORMS THEIR FORMED IN THIS

01:01:09.232 --> 01:01:10.433
VERY INFORMAL WAY AND LIKE I

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.868
SAID THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN AN

01:01:11.934 --> 01:01:13.736
AD HOC COMMITTEE AND AN OFFICIAL

01:01:13.803 --> 01:01:14.971
ONE IS AN OFFICIAL ONE GETS

01:01:15.038 --> 01:01:16.339
THEIR LAWYERS PAID FOR BY P.

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:17.373
JEANNIE.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.875
PURSES AD HOC ONES --

01:01:18.941 --> 01:01:20.009
THEY'RE PAYING FOR THEIR LAWYERS

01:01:20.076 --> 01:01:21.444
THEMSELVES WHICH IS SOME WAY IS

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:23.513
A SIGNAL OF THEIR COMMITMENT --

01:01:23.579 --> 01:01:25.848
WHAT I EXPECT THEM TO COME IN

01:01:25.915 --> 01:01:27.483
WORK THE BUILDING I WOULD --

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:30.019
I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF THEY DID

01:01:30.086 --> 01:01:35.892
AND I WAS ONCE WORKING ON BE.

01:01:35.958 --> 01:01:37.260
YOU KNOW TO TO NOT TO WORK THEN

01:01:37.326 --> 01:01:38.094
THE WRONG WORD TO HAVE

01:01:38.161 --> 01:01:39.962
DISCUSSIONS AND TO TRY TO

01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:41.664
EDUCATE --

01:01:41.731 --> 01:01:43.499
AND EXPLAIN TO YOU KNOW THE

01:01:43.566 --> 01:01:45.535
ETHICAL REGULATORY BODY.

01:01:45.601 --> 01:01:47.637
WHY IT IS THAT YOU KNOW WE

01:01:47.703 --> 01:01:48.271
THOUGHT SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN

01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:49.872
OR NOT --

01:01:49.939 --> 01:01:51.674
AND YOU KNOW YES I WOULD EXPECT

01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:53.576
THAT YOU WILL HEAR FROM THEM

01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:55.711
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

01:01:55.778 --> 01:01:58.181
THANK YOU SIR HERTZBERG.

01:01:58.247 --> 01:01:59.282
DID YOU ATTEND ANY OF THE

01:01:59.348 --> 01:02:01.284
HEARINGS IN THIS CASE --

01:02:01.350 --> 01:02:02.952
I DID NOT BUT I SENT SOME

01:02:03.019 --> 01:02:04.754
STUDENTS ON MY BEHALF WHO TOLD

01:02:04.821 --> 01:02:06.556
ME SOME THINGS BUT I KNOW I DID

01:02:06.622 --> 01:02:08.357
NOT I I LISTEN TO PARTS OF THEM.

01:02:08.424 --> 01:02:09.992
DID AND IF I CAN JUST.

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:12.061
ADD TO WHAT THOSE ARE MORE LIKE

01:02:12.128 --> 01:02:13.262
ASKED ABOUT COLOR IN THE CASE OR

01:02:13.329 --> 01:02:14.397
ANYTHING --

01:02:14.464 --> 01:02:16.933
THAT YOU LEARN FROM THOSE THINGS

01:02:16.999 --> 01:02:17.533
THAT COULD BE INSIGHTFUL TO

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.334
SHARE WITH THIS COMMITTEE.

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:21.170
IN YOUR JUDGMENT IT WAS REPORTED

01:02:21.237 --> 01:02:22.205
TO A YOU LISTEN --

01:02:22.271 --> 01:02:24.440
TO MY MY JUDGMENT IS THAT THIS

01:02:24.507 --> 01:02:25.241
CASE IS IN A VERY PRELIMINARY

01:02:25.308 --> 01:02:26.442
PAY PLACE YOU KNOW THERE IS

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:28.478
THERE ARE MOTIONS ON THE TABLE

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:30.179
TO STABILIZE P. GENIES BUSINESS.

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:32.248
AND THEN THERE'S JUST A LOT OF

01:02:32.315 --> 01:02:33.649
ACTION AROUND THE EDGES YOU THE

01:02:33.716 --> 01:02:36.018
PPA ISSUES --

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:37.286
YOU HAVE VARIOUS MOTIONS WHICH

01:02:37.353 --> 01:02:38.621
WILL CALL THEM IF THEY MOTIONS

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:43.292
THAT ARE BEING FILED --

01:02:43.359 --> 01:02:45.928
WHERE VARIOUS PARTIES ARE SAYING

01:02:45.995 --> 01:02:47.964
REALLY LATE HOURS GO AHEAD --

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:48.998
AND YOU'RE JUST IN A VERY

01:02:49.065 --> 01:02:51.134
PRELIMINARY PLACE WHERE YOU'RE

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.336
NOT YET SEEN THE LEADERSHIP OUT

01:02:53.402 --> 01:02:54.937
OF P. JEANNIE WHICH WOULD SAY

01:02:55.004 --> 01:02:56.272
THIS IS WHERE THIS IS GOING.

01:02:56.339 --> 01:02:56.772
YOU'RE IN THE BUSINESS

01:02:56.839 --> 01:02:59.575
STABILIZATION PHASE OF THE CASE --

01:02:59.642 --> 01:03:00.877
IN JUDGMENT HOLLY IS REALLY

01:03:00.943 --> 01:03:03.012
BEING JUDICIOUS IN SAYING YOU

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:04.580
KNOW IF THERE'S A CONTENTIOUS

01:03:04.647 --> 01:03:06.082
ISSUE LET'S WAIT A LITTLE WHILE

01:03:06.149 --> 01:03:07.583
TO RULE ON IT LET'S SEE WE CAN

01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:09.852
COME TO SOME CONCLUSIONS --

01:03:09.919 --> 01:03:11.187
OR YOU CAN NEGOTIATED RETEK

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:13.022
REACHES SETTLEMENT I THINK ONE

01:03:13.089 --> 01:03:13.923
THING YOU WOULD START TO SEE

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:15.791
FROM JUDGMENT HOLLY IS THE

01:03:15.858 --> 01:03:16.692
INSTINCT THAT YOU WOULD.

01:03:16.759 --> 01:03:18.594
YOU EXPECT HIM TO SHOW BASED ON

01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:20.897
HIS REPUTATION THAT HE IS TRYING

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:22.064
TO PROD PEOPLE TO COME TO A DEAL

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:23.966
OUTSIDE THE COURTROOM AS OPPOSED

01:03:24.033 --> 01:03:24.734
TO HIM.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.335
MAKING RULINGS AND EVERYTHING

01:03:26.402 --> 01:03:28.104
THAT RING AND IN THAT REGARD --

01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:29.372
FROM YOUR OBSERVATIONS AMONG THE

01:03:29.438 --> 01:03:30.773
RELATIONSHIPS THAT YOU HAVE AND

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.441
FRIENDS AND THE LIKE IN AROUND

01:03:32.508 --> 01:03:33.676
THE BANKRUPTCY. TO THE

01:03:33.743 --> 01:03:34.877
GOVERNOR'S STATE OF THE STATE

01:03:34.944 --> 01:03:36.479
WERE INDICATED THAT HE WANTS TO

01:03:36.546 --> 01:03:38.014
FOCUS ON SOME SOLUTION IN SIXTY

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.882
DAYS HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE

01:03:39.949 --> 01:03:41.017
DISCUSSION FROM YOUR JUDGMENT --

01:03:41.083 --> 01:03:42.618
I ACTUALLY THINK THAT IT HAD A

01:03:42.685 --> 01:03:44.754
SURPRISINGLY LARGE IMPACT ON

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:46.088
BASED ON WHAT I'VE HEARD --

01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:48.457
AGAIN IN INFORMAL CONVERSATIONS

01:03:48.524 --> 01:03:52.094
WITH INVESTORS --

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:52.795
IT IS.

01:03:52.862 --> 01:03:53.596
AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE LIKE THE

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:55.464
CITY THEN PUBLISHED A RESEARCH

01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:57.099
NOTE SAYING ALL IT LOOKS LIKE

01:03:57.166 --> 01:03:58.267
ALL INTO THE SKY IS BLUE AND ALL

01:03:58.334 --> 01:04:00.002
IS CLEAR THE GOVERNOR'S REALLY

01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:04.173
ENGAGED -- I

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:04.740
WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED GIVEN

01:04:04.807 --> 01:04:08.711
THAT THERE WERE FOCUSED IT WAS

01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:09.812
RESEARCH WAS ASKED REASSURED BY

01:04:09.879 --> 01:04:11.714
THAT AS THEY HAVE BEEN IF YOU

01:04:11.781 --> 01:04:14.584
LOOK AT THE MARKET PRICES OF P.

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:15.818
GENIES BONDS --

01:04:15.885 --> 01:04:17.520
IT'S AT LEAST THE LAST I CHECKED

01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:18.487
ON THE MARKET SEEMS TO THINK

01:04:18.554 --> 01:04:19.555
THAT THE BOND HOLDERS ARE GOING

01:04:19.622 --> 01:04:21.691
TO BE PEYTON FALL SO THAT WOULD

01:04:21.757 --> 01:04:23.426
IMPLY THAT EITHER THERE'S LESS

01:04:23.492 --> 01:04:25.928
LIVE BLESSED LOUD FIRE LIABILITY

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:26.495
THAN WE THOUGHT MEANING P.

01:04:26.562 --> 01:04:27.330
JEANNIE.

01:04:27.396 --> 01:04:28.297
WON'T HAVE TO PAY AS MUCH TO

01:04:28.364 --> 01:04:29.899
WILD FIRE VICTIMS AS PERHAPS

01:04:29.966 --> 01:04:31.500
THEY WORRY --

01:04:31.567 --> 01:04:33.336
OR THAT THERE'S AN EXPECTATION

01:04:33.402 --> 01:04:35.204
OF SOME SORT OF LEGISLATURE EVER

01:04:35.271 --> 01:04:36.706
GUBERNATORIAL INTERVENTION --

01:04:36.772 --> 01:04:37.974
BUT YES I THINK THAT THAT WAS A

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.475
STATEMENT THAT THE MARKET HEARD

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:40.910
LOUD AND CLEAR AND I THINK

01:04:40.977 --> 01:04:42.578
PEOPLE TOOK IT FOR YOU KNOW

01:04:42.645 --> 01:04:45.648
HEARING WHAT THEY WANTED TO HEAR

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:49.118
TO SOME EXTENT.

01:04:49.185 --> 01:04:49.352

MORNING THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE

01:04:55.591 --> 01:04:56.726
TODAY SIR --

01:04:56.792 --> 01:04:57.927
JUST TWO VERY QUICK QUESTIONS

01:04:57.994 --> 01:04:59.228
ONE HAS TO DO WITH PRESIDENT IN --

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:00.229
IN PARTICULAR --

01:05:00.296 --> 01:05:02.498
DISASTER VICTIMS WHAT TYPE

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:05.368
PRESIDENT CAN YOU POINT TO OR

WHERE --

01:05:07.103 --> 01:05:08.638
DISASTER VICTIMS.

01:05:08.704 --> 01:05:09.438
YOU SEE SOME TYPE OF

01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:11.107
COMPENSATION.

01:05:11.173 --> 01:05:12.275
DURING ANY TYPE OF BANKRUPTCY OF

01:05:12.341 --> 01:05:14.210
UTILITY IS THERE ANYTHING TO BE

01:05:14.277 --> 01:05:16.045
ABLE TO POINT TO THAT YOU KNOW.

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:17.913
OF ANY CASE LAW OUT THERE.

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.582
SO THERE ARE UTILITY CASES.

01:05:19.649 --> 01:05:21.751
WHERE STUFF LIKE THIS HAPPENS

01:05:21.817 --> 01:05:22.618
WHAT COMES TO MIND A LITTLE BIT

01:05:22.685 --> 01:05:24.787
MORE READILY ARE CASES WHERE YOU

01:05:24.854 --> 01:05:26.489
HAVE COMPANIES THAT MANUFACTURE

01:05:26.555 --> 01:05:27.690
PRODUCTS THAT HURT PEOPLE

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:29.558
WHETHER THEY CONTAIN ASBESTOS

01:05:29.625 --> 01:05:31.193
WHICH IS OUR MANAGER IS OFTEN A

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.462
SITUATION --

01:05:33.529 --> 01:05:36.699
THERE DEFINITELY A LOTS OF I

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:37.967
DISASTERS WHAT WE'D CALL

01:05:38.034 --> 01:05:39.535
MASSPORT SITUATIONS ENDS THERE

01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:41.070
ARE PLENTY OF THOSE CASES THAT

01:05:41.137 --> 01:05:42.538
PROVIDED IZEABLE OR EVEN

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:44.974
RECOVERIES AND FALL TO THOSE

01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:45.408
CREDITORS.

01:05:45.474 --> 01:05:46.709
THANK YOU SO MUCH IN THE SECOND

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:48.944
PIECE IS IN REGARDS TO THE POWER

01:05:49.011 --> 01:05:50.846
PURCHASE CONTRACTS --

01:05:50.913 --> 01:05:53.049
AND THE ISSUE OF STATE LAW.

01:05:53.115 --> 01:05:55.918
SO -- STATE

01:05:55.985 --> 01:05:57.153
IS BEEN VERY CLEAR WHERE WE NEED

01:05:57.219 --> 01:05:57.520
TO BE ADDED --

01:05:57.586 --> 01:05:59.555
THEIR CLIMATE GOALS BOTH WITH

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:01.857
THE TAIL PIPE IS WELL AS ON OUR

01:06:01.924 --> 01:06:03.893
PARA PROCUREMENT.

01:06:03.959 --> 01:06:05.594
SO THEY WOULDN'T POTENTIALLY

01:06:05.661 --> 01:06:06.529
COULD BE ABLE TO CUT THOSE

01:06:06.595 --> 01:06:08.030
CONTRACTS THAT ARE PLACE BUT

01:06:08.097 --> 01:06:09.498
THEY STILL HAVE.

01:06:09.565 --> 01:06:11.867
TO FACE STATE LAW THAT MANDATES.

01:06:11.934 --> 01:06:13.536
THEM POTENTIALLY GETTING BACK

01:06:13.602 --> 01:06:15.905
INTO THOSE CONTRACTS BUT REALLY

01:06:15.971 --> 01:06:17.006
THIS IS MORE POLITICAL AND

01:06:17.073 --> 01:06:18.140
TRYING TO BE A DRIVE A CHEAPER

01:06:18.207 --> 01:06:19.008
RATE -- IS

01:06:19.075 --> 01:06:20.543
THAT ACCURATE.

01:06:20.609 --> 01:06:21.143
SO -- A

01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:22.945
COUPLE OF THINGS SO FIRST I I'M

01:06:23.012 --> 01:06:24.146
NOT FAMILIAR WITH ALL OF THE

01:06:24.213 --> 01:06:26.082
DETAILS OF THE CLEAN ENERGY

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:27.550
MANDATES THAT P. JEANNIE HAS TO

01:06:27.616 --> 01:06:29.085
DEAL WITH WHEN P. GENIE COMES

01:06:29.151 --> 01:06:31.053
OUT OF BANKRUPTCY THEY DO HAVE

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:32.088
TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:32.621
LAW.

01:06:32.688 --> 01:06:34.090
MEANING THEY HAVE TO BE ACTING

01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:35.124
IN A WAY THAT THE REGULATORY

01:06:35.191 --> 01:06:36.892
EXPECTS THEM TO THEY HAVE TO DO

01:06:36.959 --> 01:06:38.728
THE THINGS THAT YOU EXPECT THEM

01:06:38.794 --> 01:06:39.595
TO DO -- AND

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:40.996
I WOULD ASSUME THAT COLORS THE

01:06:41.063 --> 01:06:42.631
DECISIONS THAT BILL MAKING

01:06:42.698 --> 01:06:43.833
BANKRUPTCY CASE --

01:06:43.899 --> 01:06:44.900
BECAUSE ONE PART OF A FEASIBLE

01:06:44.967 --> 01:06:47.203
PLAN WILL BE BEING IN A POSITION

01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:49.004
TO COMPLY WITH STATE LAW --

01:06:49.071 --> 01:06:50.840
WHETHER THAT MEANS THAT THEY YOU

01:06:50.906 --> 01:06:52.208
KNOW LITIGATE WITH YOU KNOW PPA

01:06:52.274 --> 01:06:53.309
COUNTERPARTIES RATHER

01:06:53.376 --> 01:06:55.444
COUNTERPARTIES AND TRY TO CHANGE

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:56.746
SOME OF THE STRUCTURE ALONG THE

01:06:56.812 --> 01:06:58.581
WAY I DON'T KNOW.

01:06:58.647 --> 01:06:59.982
BUT THEY DO NEED LIKE THEY NEED

01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:01.117
TO OBEY STATE LAW THERE IN

01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:02.885
BANKRUPTCY AND AFTERWARDS AND

01:07:02.952 --> 01:07:05.688
AND THAT'S WHY --

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:09.091
AS A NON LAWYER I DAY.

01:07:09.158 --> 01:07:10.559
OUT WHERE --

01:07:10.626 --> 01:07:12.862
TRYING TO BE ABLE TO FIND.

01:07:12.928 --> 01:07:14.597
MORE ATTRACTIVE TERMS OF

01:07:14.663 --> 01:07:16.098
CONTRACT BUT STILL IT KNOWING

01:07:16.165 --> 01:07:16.999
THAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET

01:07:17.066 --> 01:07:19.068
HALF OF THE POWER SUPPLY FROM A

01:07:19.135 --> 01:07:20.369
GREEN.

01:07:20.436 --> 01:07:21.337
A CERTIFIED AGREEMENT NOBLE

01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:22.471
SOURCE --

01:07:22.538 --> 01:07:23.372
AND THAT IS A CENTER THAT COULD

01:07:23.439 --> 01:07:25.241
POTENTIALLY PLAY UP I THINK THAT

01:07:25.307 --> 01:07:26.609
THAT IS CORRECT BASED ON MY

01:07:26.675 --> 01:07:29.378
UNDERSTANDING OF THE RENEWABLE

01:07:29.445 --> 01:07:30.546
MANDATE SAYS WALLACE PEKINGESE

01:07:30.613 --> 01:07:32.114
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT WHICH

01:07:32.181 --> 01:07:33.716
WILL DISRUPT.

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:34.917
SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE INDUSTRY

01:07:34.984 --> 01:07:36.419
WHO'VE BEEN COUNTING ON WHAT

01:07:36.485 --> 01:07:37.586
THOSE RATES ARE --

01:07:37.653 --> 01:07:38.854
AND THAT WILL HAVE A TRICKLE

01:07:38.921 --> 01:07:43.793
DOWN EFFECT OBVIOUSLY SO THAT

01:07:43.859 --> 01:07:46.562
THAT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE.

01:07:46.629 --> 01:07:47.897
CENTER BRADFORD THEN FOLLOWED BY

01:07:47.963 --> 01:07:48.964
SENATOR DODD THANK YOU MISSED

01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:50.466
YOUR ON I'M JUST CURIOUS AS IT

01:07:50.533 --> 01:07:52.802
COMES TO ASSESSING A LIABILITY

01:07:52.868 --> 01:07:54.270
WHETHER IT BE ON P. GINNY WE

01:07:54.336 --> 01:07:55.504
KEEP HEARING --

01:07:55.571 --> 01:07:56.839
THE NEW NORM IN CLIMATE CHANGE

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:57.940
AND I'M TRYING TO SEE WHAT

01:07:58.007 --> 01:08:00.509
DEGREE WILL THAT BE FACTORED IN.

01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:02.511
BECAUSE I IF YOU LOOK AT

01:08:02.578 --> 01:08:03.879
HISTORICALLY --

01:08:03.946 --> 01:08:05.915
UTILITIES OF CALLS NO MORE FIRES

01:08:05.981 --> 01:08:08.050
TODAY THAN THEY DID TWENTY

01:08:08.117 --> 01:08:08.851
THIRTY YEARS AGO THE ONLY

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:10.886
DIFFERENCE IS YOU GOT MORE FUEL

01:08:10.953 --> 01:08:12.087
OUT THERE YET.

01:08:12.154 --> 01:08:14.023
I DROUGHT SEASON SO WILL YOU

01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:15.724
FACTOR WILL TEACH A COURT TO

01:08:15.791 --> 01:08:16.425
FACTOR IN.

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:20.796
CLIMATE CHANGE AND ON MANAGE

01:08:20.863 --> 01:08:25.034
FORCED BY BOTH THANK YOU SIR I

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:26.769
THINK THE ANSWER TO THAT IS THAT.

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:27.870
JUST MONTHS HOW HE'S GOING TO

01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:28.704
HAVE TO TAKE THAT INTO

01:08:28.771 --> 01:08:30.639
CONSIDERATION BECAUSE IT GOES

01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:32.475
AGAIN TO THE FEASIBILITY OF ANY

01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:33.909
BANKRUPTCY PLAN P. JEANNIE HOUSE.

01:08:33.976 --> 01:08:35.411
THEY CAN'T HAVE A PLAN THAT'S

01:08:35.478 --> 01:08:36.946
DESIGNED FOR THE DROUGHT

01:08:37.012 --> 01:08:38.781
CONDITIONS OR LEVEL OF FUEL THAT

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:40.449
EXISTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE

01:08:40.516 --> 01:08:41.517
THEY HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN THAT

01:08:41.584 --> 01:08:42.918
WORKS WITH THE DROUGHT

01:08:42.985 --> 01:08:45.087
CONDITIONS AND THAT YOU KNOW THE

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:46.155
TORT LIABILITY --

01:08:46.222 --> 01:08:47.656
ENVIRONMENT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE

01:08:47.723 --> 01:08:49.859
TODAY SO I THINK THAT IS

01:08:49.925 --> 01:08:50.659
SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD

01:08:50.726 --> 01:08:54.396
STRONGLY EXPECTS JUDGMENTS HOLLY

01:08:54.463 --> 01:08:56.966
TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION.

01:08:57.032 --> 01:08:58.467
AND I I JUST BE BACK ON THAT.

01:08:58.534 --> 01:09:00.336
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HARDEN AGREE

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:03.138
I'D AND LYING CLEARING SOMETIMES

01:09:03.205 --> 01:09:04.473
LINE CLEARNESS A FACTOR OF?

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:05.674
ACCESS TO PROPERTY STILL WILL

01:09:05.741 --> 01:09:07.343
THAT ALSO BE FACTORED IN BECAUSE

01:09:07.409 --> 01:09:09.712
A LOT OF TIMES YOU CAN'T ACCESS

01:09:09.778 --> 01:09:11.146
SOME PROPERTIES BUDGET THEIR

01:09:11.213 --> 01:09:12.548
FEDERAL LANDS ARE PROBABLY ONLY

01:09:12.615 --> 01:09:13.415
ANSWER THAT.

01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:16.085
THEY WON'T LET HIM WANT TO CLEAR.

01:09:16.151 --> 01:09:16.719
SO -- I'M

01:09:16.785 --> 01:09:19.455
NOT I'M NOT SUPER DEEPLY AND I'M

01:09:19.522 --> 01:09:21.957
FAMILIAR WITH THE WORLD OF

01:09:22.024 --> 01:09:23.292
CLEARING TREES FROM FEDERAL AND

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:25.461
STATE LANDS BUT I WILL SAY THAT

01:09:25.528 --> 01:09:27.763
THERE TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:29.231
CREATES A BARRIER THAT MEANS THE

01:09:29.298 --> 01:09:30.332
P. JEANNIE.

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:31.667
CAN'T LEAVE BANKRUPTCY SAYING TO

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:33.969
THE JUDGE JUDGE WE'VE ELIMINATED

01:09:34.036 --> 01:09:35.971
ALL OF THE POTENTIAL BECAUSE

01:09:36.038 --> 01:09:36.906
WILDFIRES THAT ARE MASSIVELY

01:09:36.972 --> 01:09:38.574
DAMAGING IN THE FUTURE.

01:09:38.641 --> 01:09:39.875
IN THAT CASE YOU WOULD EXPECT

01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:42.111
THE P. JEANNIE MIGHT BE ABLE TO

01:09:42.177 --> 01:09:43.946
NEED TO SAY.

01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:44.914
YOUR ON YOUR HONOR --

01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:46.315
WE HAVE SOME SORT OF INSURANCE

01:09:46.382 --> 01:09:48.918
SOLUTION BECAUSE WE AREN'T ABLE

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:50.419
TO LIMIT ALL LIABILITY THAT WE

01:09:50.486 --> 01:09:51.687
MIGHT HAVE AND TO THE EXTENT

01:09:51.754 --> 01:09:53.222
THAT THEY FACE A REGULATORY

01:09:53.289 --> 01:09:54.023
LANDSCAPE.

01:09:54.089 --> 01:09:55.758
OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND THE

01:09:55.824 --> 01:09:57.893
INABILITY TO YOU KNOW TAKE OVER

01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.028
AROUND POWER LINES AND PUT THEM

01:09:59.094 --> 01:10:00.462
UNDERGROUND OR DO OTHER THINGS

01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:02.131
YOU NEED TO TO THEN.

01:10:02.197 --> 01:10:03.332
BECOME LESS LIKELY THAT THEY'RE

01:10:03.399 --> 01:10:04.767
QUICK MEN'S MAY PLAY A ROLE IN

01:10:04.833 --> 01:10:07.036
FUTURE FIRES --

01:10:07.102 --> 01:10:07.570
YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT THEN

01:10:07.636 --> 01:10:10.873
ENSURING STORY THEY'RE TELLING

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:11.807
ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE A

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:12.841
PROSPEROUS AND THRIVING COMPANY

01:10:12.908 --> 01:10:15.711
IN THE FUTURE.

01:10:15.778 --> 01:10:17.646
THANK YOU SIR SENATOR DOT.

THEY'RE VERY GOOD --

01:10:22.818 --> 01:10:24.353
PRESENTATION --

01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:25.888
OBSERVER WIRE BROUGHT UP ABOUT

01:10:25.955 --> 01:10:27.122
PRESIDENT --

01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:28.524
FOR VICTIMS.

01:10:28.591 --> 01:10:30.759
YOU KNOW I I'M HEARING SOME --

01:10:30.826 --> 01:10:32.027
YOU KNOW TALK AROUND THE THE

01:10:32.094 --> 01:10:34.863
EDGES SO TO SPEAK AS YOU --

01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:35.564
SAID ABOUT --

01:10:35.631 --> 01:10:37.533
A MOVE AFOOT TO TRY TO HAVE SOME

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:40.235
SORT OF A QUICK SETTLEMENT.

01:10:40.302 --> 01:10:41.503
FOR VICTIMS I'M JUST WONDERING

01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:44.006
I'VE I I COULD EVEN IMAGINE HOW

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:44.373
THAT.

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:45.207
PROCESS WOULD WORK --

01:10:45.274 --> 01:10:46.976
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AT

01:10:47.042 --> 01:10:50.045
ALL AND HOW THAT COULD HAPPEN.

01:10:50.112 --> 01:10:51.480
THE BANKRUPTCY LOS STRONGLY

01:10:51.547 --> 01:10:52.948
PROMOTES SETTLEMENT --

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:56.685
AND WITH THIS MEANS THAT ON TO

01:10:56.752 --> 01:10:57.453
THE SENSE THAT EVERYBODY READY

01:10:57.519 --> 01:10:58.787
GET SET AROUND THE TABLE AND

01:10:58.854 --> 01:11:00.623
AGREED JUDGE WE'VE SOLVED ALL OF

01:11:00.689 --> 01:11:01.957
OUR PROBLEMS THE JUDGE WITH AND

01:11:02.024 --> 01:11:03.726
BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO BLAST THAT.

01:11:03.792 --> 01:11:05.728
AND SND IT'S ON ITS WAY --

01:11:05.794 --> 01:11:08.097
IT CERTAINLY SEEMS UNLIKELY

01:11:08.163 --> 01:11:09.632
GIVEN MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACTS

01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:11.066
THAT NEED TO BE FOUND IN

01:11:11.133 --> 01:11:12.835
CONNECTION WITH ALL THE

01:11:12.901 --> 01:11:14.336
POTENTIAL WHILE FOR LIABILITY

01:11:14.403 --> 01:11:15.604
THAT MIGHT BE OUT THERE --

01:11:15.671 --> 01:11:17.006
AND YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THE

01:11:17.072 --> 01:11:18.641
P. JEANNIE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH

01:11:18.707 --> 01:11:19.708
MONEY TO PAY ALL THE ASSERTED

01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:21.877
CLAIMS YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE A

01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:23.912
CLAIM THAT IS GOOD YOU MAY YOU

01:11:23.979 --> 01:11:25.414
KNOW YOU HAVE THE STANDING IN

01:11:25.481 --> 01:11:26.415
BANKRUPTCY COURT.

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:27.816
THAN OBJECTS TO SOMEBODY WHO IS

01:11:27.883 --> 01:11:29.918
A CLAIM THAT YOU FEEL IS NOT AS

01:11:29.985 --> 01:11:32.054
GOOD SO IT CERTAINLY IS POSSIBLE

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:33.422
THAT THERE COULD BE A QUICK

01:11:33.489 --> 01:11:34.289
SETTLEMENT TO FLY.

01:11:34.356 --> 01:11:36.025
BUT ABSENT THE RESOURCES TO SORT

01:11:36.091 --> 01:11:38.394
OF MAKE EVERYBODY HAPPY --

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:41.630
IT'S MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT WE'LL

01:11:41.697 --> 01:11:43.098
SEE LITIGATION [inaudible]

01:11:43.165 --> 01:11:46.368
THERE'S GONNA.

01:11:46.435 --> 01:11:47.403
I'M THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU'RE FOR

01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:49.104
PUTTING THIS TOGETHER AND THANK

YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION

01:11:49.938 --> 01:11:51.240
LEARNED A LOT.

01:11:51.306 --> 01:11:53.842
I'M FOLLOWING UP ON ANGLE AROUND

01:11:53.909 --> 01:11:55.577
THIS QUESTION OF THE FIRE

01:11:55.644 --> 01:11:57.246
VICTIMS CLAIMS.

01:11:57.312 --> 01:11:59.882
IF I UNDERSTOOD YOU RIGHT THE

01:11:59.948 --> 01:12:01.250
THE CLAIMS THAT ARE RELEVANT IN

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:02.918
THIS BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING ARE

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:04.853
THOSE THAT WERE MADE FREE THE

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.155
FILING OF THE BANKRUPTCY DID I

01:12:06.221 --> 01:12:07.723
UNDERSTAND THAT CORRECT OR NO SO

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:10.459
THAT IS NOT CORRECT OKAY --

01:12:10.526 --> 01:12:11.894
SO -- I'M I

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.562
APOLOGIZE FOR MISS SPEAKING SO

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:14.530
TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE WERE

01:12:14.596 --> 01:12:16.098
LAWSUITS THAT WERE FILED PRIOR

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:17.900
TO THE BANKRUPTCY THAT'S PART OF

01:12:17.966 --> 01:12:18.534
THE STORY OF WHY THEY'RE IN

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.102
BANKRUPTCY. TO THE EXTENT THERE

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:21.770
PEOPLE WHO SUFFERED DAMAGES THAT

01:12:21.837 --> 01:12:22.938
THEY HAVE YET TO SEE WINE AND

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:24.339
THEY STILL CAN WITHIN THE

01:12:24.406 --> 01:12:24.973
APPLICABLE STATUTE OF

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:25.874
LIMITATIONS.

01:12:25.941 --> 01:12:27.710
THEY'RE WELCOME TO FILE A CLAIM

01:12:27.776 --> 01:12:28.877
WITH THE BANKRUPTCY COURTS THEY

01:12:28.944 --> 01:12:30.946
WELCOME TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:33.315
BANKRUPTCY PROCESS AND ACTUALLY --

01:12:33.382 --> 01:12:34.983
THE WAY BANKRUPTCY ALL WORKS IS

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:36.485
THAT EVEN IF THEY DON'T FILE A

01:12:36.552 --> 01:12:38.554
CLAIM --

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:41.356
THEY STILL CAN BE SUBJECT TO SO

01:12:41.423 --> 01:12:42.991
IT IS IN THEIR STRONG INTEREST

01:12:43.058 --> 01:12:44.093
TO FILE A CLAIM BECAUSE THAT

01:12:44.159 --> 01:12:45.527
WILL ALLOW THEM TO RECEIVE

01:12:45.594 --> 01:12:47.329
WHATEVER VALUE WAS THERE TO PAY

01:12:47.396 --> 01:12:48.831
THEM SO YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT

01:12:48.897 --> 01:12:49.932
PART OF WHAT THIS BANKRUPTCY IS

01:12:49.998 --> 01:12:50.933
GOING TO BE.

01:12:50.999 --> 01:12:52.668
IS TRYING TO PRIDE EVERYONE WHO

01:12:52.735 --> 01:12:54.603
HAS A CLEAN FOR LIABILITY TO

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:56.872
ASSERT AT IN THE PROCESS OF A

01:12:56.939 --> 01:12:58.574
CERTI IT IS GOING TO BE GOING ON

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.008
A FOREMAN FILLING OUT A WE'RE

01:13:00.075 --> 01:13:00.676
GOING ON A WEBSITE AND FILL OUT

01:13:00.743 --> 01:13:01.543
A FORM.

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:03.045
SO ACTUALLY I WOULD EXPECT LOTS

01:13:03.112 --> 01:13:04.680
OF PEOPLE WITH CLAIMS THAT ARE

01:13:04.747 --> 01:13:06.381
VERY GOOD TO FILE THOSE CLAIMS I

01:13:06.448 --> 01:13:07.750
WOULD ALSO EXPECT THE COMPANY

01:13:07.816 --> 01:13:08.984
WILL HAVE A PROCESS.

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:10.886
OF WEEDING THROUGH PEOPLE WHO

01:13:10.953 --> 01:13:11.153
YOU KNOW.

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:12.921
A CERTAIN TEN MILLION DOLLARS

01:13:12.988 --> 01:13:14.923
WORTH OF CLAIMS ON YOU KNOW ANON

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:19.194
AN IMPLAUSIBLE FACT PATTERN FOR

01:13:19.261 --> 01:13:19.995
TEN MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF

01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:21.096
CLAIMS -- SO

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:21.597
WE FOLLOWING UP ON THAT

01:13:21.663 --> 01:13:21.897
[inaudible]

01:13:21.964 --> 01:13:25.934
WE THERE ARE CLEARLY SOME OF THE

01:13:26.001 --> 01:13:27.236
FIRES FOR WHICH INVESTIGATIONS

01:13:27.302 --> 01:13:29.004
HAVE BEEN COMPLETE.

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:31.440
AND SOME LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY

01:13:31.507 --> 01:13:33.308
HAS BEEN ASSIGNED.

01:13:33.375 --> 01:13:35.377
THERE ARE SUBSEQUENT ONES WHERE

01:13:35.444 --> 01:13:37.980
THAT HAS NOT OCCURRED YET.

01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:41.517
AND SO HOW HOW DO THOSE FACTORS

01:13:41.583 --> 01:13:43.652
IN THIS --

01:13:43.719 --> 01:13:44.887
IN THE BANKRUPTCY --

01:13:44.953 --> 01:13:46.889
IS SO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

01:13:46.955 --> 01:13:47.923
CLAIMED SO.

01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:49.091
YOU SHOULD THINK OF EVERYBODY

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:50.659
WAS A CLAIM AS HAVING A BODY OF

01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:51.927
EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS THAT

01:13:51.994 --> 01:13:52.828
CLAIM.

01:13:52.895 --> 01:13:53.929
AND SO TO THE EXTENT THERE BEEN

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:55.998
FINDINGS BY CAL FIRE OTHERS THAT

01:13:56.064 --> 01:13:58.133
P. GENIE IS LIABLE OR P. GENIES

01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.401
ADMITTING LIABILITY.

01:13:59.468 --> 01:14:01.370
THOSE ARE FACTS THAT ARE HELPFUL

01:14:01.436 --> 01:14:02.871
FOR THAT PERSON IN ASSERTING THE

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:05.073
CLAIM YOU COULD YOU COULD ALSO

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:07.009
IMAGINE THOUGH THAT PERHAPS.

01:14:07.075 --> 01:14:08.243
YOU KNOW HIGHLY MOTIVATED

01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:09.912
SHAREHOLDERS COULD FILED BECAUSE

01:14:09.978 --> 01:14:11.914
HIRE THEIR OWN EXPERTS TO TRY TO

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.048
DISPUTE WHATEVER THOSE FACTUAL

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:16.451
FINDINGS WERE IF THEY WANTED --

01:14:16.518 --> 01:14:18.020
TO SO YOU EXPECTED THE KNOW THAT

01:14:18.086 --> 01:14:19.021
TO BE HELPFUL EVIDENCE FOR

01:14:19.087 --> 01:14:20.556
WHOEVER IS ASSERTING CLAIMS FOR

01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:23.025
DAMAGES -- A

01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:23.992
BUT THERE STILL COULD BE A

01:14:24.059 --> 01:14:26.995
LITIGATION HAVE CLAIMS THAT WERE

01:14:27.062 --> 01:14:28.330
THERE HAVE NOT YET BEEN FINDINGS

01:14:28.397 --> 01:14:30.199
FROM ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES

01:14:30.265 --> 01:14:31.733
FROM CAL FIRE OR FROM OTHERS OR

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:34.036
P. GENIE IS HAS NOT YET ADMITTED

01:14:34.102 --> 01:14:34.636
LIABILITY --

01:14:34.703 --> 01:14:36.104
THEY JUST HAVE MORE WORK TO DO

01:14:36.171 --> 01:14:36.939
AND TRYING TO PROVE TO THE

01:14:37.005 --> 01:14:38.307
COURTS THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO

WHATEVER IT IS AND YOU CAN

01:14:40.943 --> 01:14:42.477
ASSUME THAT THOSE INVESTIGATIONS

01:14:42.544 --> 01:14:44.246
COULD INFORM THE JUDGES FACT

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:45.747
FINDING BUT THE JUDGE MAY ALSO

01:14:45.814 --> 01:14:48.250
DECIDE HE'S NOT GOING TO WAIT

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:50.419
FOR ALL OF THAT FACT FINDING.

01:14:50.485 --> 01:14:51.220
NO HE WOULD HAVE THAT OPTION IF

01:14:51.286 --> 01:14:53.422
YOU WANTED TO SO THEN FINALLY --

01:14:53.488 --> 01:14:54.156

BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS THE JUDGE

01:30:51.779 --> 01:30:54.015
SO A BANKRUPTCY COURT WILL

01:30:54.081 --> 01:30:55.750
RESOLVE ALL PRE PETITION.

01:30:55.817 --> 01:30:57.151

BIG POLICY PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES.

01:38:41.849 --> 01:38:43.917
AND THAT WE THINK THE ONLY.

01:38:43.984 --> 01:38:45.786
WAY SHE'S GOING TO GET OUT OF

01:38:45.853 --> 01:38:47.154
BANKRUPTCIES GET INVOLVED.

01:38:47.221 --> 01:38:48.589

THE HEARTS OF STATE LAW.

01:39:05.139 --> 01:39:06.907
AND WHEN WE ARE I MEAN I THINK

01:39:08.375 --> 01:39:09.877
ATMOSPHERE [inaudible]

01:39:09.943 --> 01:39:11.712
WHERE?

01:39:11.779 --> 01:39:12.946
WE'RE BEGINNING TO ASSESS

01:39:13.013 --> 01:39:16.116
LIABILITIES DIFFERENTLY.

01:39:16.183 --> 01:39:18.352
AND AND THE WAY WE OPERATE OUR

01:39:18.419 --> 01:39:20.087
UTILITY NOW I THINK IS GOING TO

01:39:20.154 --> 01:39:22.189
CHANGE GOING INTO THE FUTURE

01:39:22.256 --> 01:39:23.590
THAT IS TO SIMPLY WHAT I MY

01:39:23.657 --> 01:39:27.161
EXPECTATION --

01:39:27.227 --> 01:39:28.062
WHETHER YOU SHARE THAT

01:39:28.128 --> 01:39:31.965

OR UTILITIES THAT.

01:39:40.074 --> 01:39:43.043
OFTEN HAVE A COST ON RATE PAYERS.

01:39:43.110 --> 01:39:45.746
OF OFTEN THOSE ARE VERY

01:39:45.813 --> 01:39:47.281
IMPORTANT PROGRAMS.

01:39:47.348 --> 01:39:49.116
BUT GIVEN.

01:39:49.183 --> 01:39:49.650
GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE

01:39:49.717 --> 01:39:51.618
THREAT.

01:39:51.685 --> 01:39:53.921
OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THESE WILD

01:39:53.987 --> 01:39:56.256

DO YOU DO YOU EXPECT THAT YOU'RE

01:40:01.695 --> 01:40:04.898
GONNA BE PRIORITIZING --

01:40:04.965 --> 01:40:07.601
THE THE SAFETY ELEMENT OVER.

01:40:07.668 --> 01:40:11.405
OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE HAD --

01:40:11.472 --> 01:40:13.073
THAT CAN BE COSTLY ANY WHAT I'M

01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:15.042
ASKING IS ARE WE GONNA WAY.

01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:18.645
OUR PRIORITIES TO MINIMIZE THE

01:40:18.712 --> 01:40:21.949
THE INCREASE OF RATES BECAUSE MY

01:40:22.015 --> 01:40:24.518
MY FEAR IS THAT WE'RE JUST GONNA

TOP.

01:40:24.785 --> 01:40:26.286
YOU KNOW PILE ON RATE INCREASES

01:40:26.353 --> 01:40:27.921
ON TOP OF OUR CURRENT PROGRAMS

AND SAY OKAY NOW WE FIX THIS

01:40:30.023 --> 01:40:30.824
PROBLEM AND NOT REALLY OF VALUE

01:40:30.891 --> 01:40:32.693
WAY.

01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:33.994
HOW WE --

01:40:34.061 --> 01:40:35.829
HOW WE REGULATE DIGIT UTILITIES

01:40:35.896 --> 01:40:37.131

01:40:37.197 --> 01:40:40.033
TO YOU KNOW --

BALANCE.

01:40:41.168 --> 01:40:42.102
YOU KNOW THE THE THE COSTS TO

01:40:42.169 --> 01:40:44.037
RATEPAYERS OF OF I WANT TO MAKE

01:40:44.104 --> 01:40:46.306
SOME INITIAL RESPONSE AND AND

01:40:46.373 --> 01:40:47.341
LET --

01:40:47.408 --> 01:40:50.577
DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF RANDOLPH ALSO

JUST RAISING RATES IS NOT COULD

SOLVE THE PROBLEM HERE --

01:40:58.018 --> 01:40:59.853
AND I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:02.022
SUFFICIENT TO GET PGP OUT OF

01:41:02.089 --> 01:41:03.323
BANKRUPTCY.

01:41:03.390 --> 01:41:04.691

CATASTROPHIC LIABILITY AND I

01:41:14.935 --> 01:41:15.769
THINK THE STATE HAS TO COME UP

01:41:15.836 --> 01:41:17.805
WITH SOME.

01:41:17.871 --> 01:41:19.406
OVER ARCHING GLOBAL SOLUTION TO

01:41:19.473 --> 01:41:24.244

VENTURE TO SAY.

01:41:25.179 --> 01:41:28.081
THAT.

01:41:28.148 --> 01:41:30.784
UTILITIES AND RATEPAYERS SHOULD

01:41:30.851 --> 01:41:33.987
NOT BE MADE --

01:41:34.054 --> 01:41:35.989
THE INSURER OF LAST RESORT.

01:41:36.056 --> 01:41:37.691
BECAUSE THAT IS NOT SUSTAINABLE.

01:41:37.758 --> 01:41:40.060
SEVERAL THE STATE ROAD IS TO

01:41:40.127 --> 01:41:41.428

ON BILLS AND I THINK THAT'S

01:42:42.923 --> 01:42:43.790
WHERE THE IMPORTANT THING IS A

01:42:43.857 --> 01:42:45.959
FOCUS ON BILLS NOT RATES WHAT

01:42:46.026 --> 01:42:46.994

THAT THERE'S AN AGREEMENT.

01:44:14.047 --> 01:44:16.149
WELL NOT NECESSARILY I MEAN THEY

01:44:16.216 --> 01:44:19.519
THERE COULD BE AGREEMENT ON PART

01:44:19.586 --> 01:44:20.954
PART OF A FRAMEWORK AND

01:44:21.021 --> 01:44:21.989
DISAGREEMENT ABOUT.

01:44:22.055 --> 01:44:24.591
OTHER ASPECTS OF IT.

01:44:24.658 --> 01:44:27.861
I REALLY CAN'T SPECULATE OKAY --

01:44:27.928 --> 01:44:29.663
WE'RE GONNA GO TO IS --

01:44:29.730 --> 01:44:32.099
CENTER MORE LOCKED AND SERVE GOD.

01:44:32.165 --> 01:44:33.467
BILL -- AND

01:44:33.533 --> 01:44:35.636
JUST A REMINDER THAT MISTER

01:44:35.702 --> 01:44:37.137
RANDOLPH ALSO HAD SOME

01:44:37.204 --> 01:44:39.840
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS.

01:44:39.906 --> 01:44:42.309
OR CAN I THINK WE'VE COVERED.

01:44:42.376 --> 01:44:47.447
OKAY WE'LL GO TO QUESTIONS --

01:44:47.514 --> 01:44:48.982
I'VE BEEN REMINDED --

01:44:49.049 --> 01:44:50.017
TO MAYBE YOU'RE GONNA COMMENT ON

THIS AND I WANT TO CUT YOU OFF

01:44:50.951 --> 01:44:53.020
BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA COMMENT ON

01:44:53.086 --> 01:44:54.888
SERVICE I GUESS.

01:44:54.955 --> 01:44:56.490
THE BIGGEST QUESTION IS HOW WILL

01:44:56.556 --> 01:44:58.025
THIS AFFECT SERVICE WILL PEOPLE

01:44:58.091 --> 01:44:59.793
BE CUT OFF WILL.

01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:01.228
WILL THAT CHANGE THE POLICY IN

01:45:01.294 --> 01:45:03.397
TERMS OF HOW SERVICES ARE

01:45:03.463 --> 01:45:05.432
DELIVERED YAH I'M I'M HAPPY TO

01:45:05.499 --> 01:45:07.234
GO INTO THAT SO --

01:45:07.300 --> 01:45:08.902
YOU KNOW IT IN THE FEW WEEKS

01:45:08.969 --> 01:45:10.837
BEFORE P. JEANNIE WAS IN

01:45:10.904 --> 01:45:11.371
BANKRUPTCY THERE WAS SOME

01:45:11.438 --> 01:45:13.340
CONCERN ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO

01:45:13.407 --> 01:45:14.941
PROVIDE SERVICE TO I DO SOME

01:45:15.008 --> 01:45:15.842
CASH FOR PROBLEMS THEY'VE HAD.

01:45:15.909 --> 01:45:17.177
NOW THAT THERE IN BANKRUPTCY AND

01:45:17.244 --> 01:45:21.682
THEY HAVE ACCESS TO ON FINANCING --

01:45:21.748 --> 01:45:22.683
THERE IS NOT.

01:45:22.749 --> 01:45:23.917
THERE THERE'S VERY LITTLE

01:45:23.984 --> 01:45:24.885
CONCERN ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO

01:45:24.951 --> 01:45:25.652
PROVIDE SERVICE BOTH BECAUSE

01:45:25.719 --> 01:45:26.653
THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THE

01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:28.488
FINANCING THEY NEED. TO BUY AND

01:45:28.555 --> 01:45:30.524
SELL ON THE ELECT --

01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:32.926
ELECTRICITY NATURAL GAS IN THE

01:45:32.993 --> 01:45:35.062
N. B. -- TO

01:45:35.128 --> 01:45:37.464
COMPLY WITH STATE --

01:45:37.531 --> 01:45:39.433
LAWS AND REGULATIONS ON SO AZAR

01:45:39.499 --> 01:45:41.234
BANKRUPTCY WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT

01:45:41.301 --> 01:45:42.803
THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO

01:45:42.869 --> 01:45:44.471
BUY AND SELL ELECTRICITY AND

01:45:44.538 --> 01:45:45.439
NATURAL GAS.

01:45:45.505 --> 01:45:46.973
ON THAT THEY'RE GONNA CONTINUE

01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:49.142
TO SPEND THE MONEY NECESSARY ON

01:45:49.209 --> 01:45:50.110
WILD FOR MEDICATION AND OTHER

01:45:50.177 --> 01:45:51.445
SEPT SAFETY MEASURES THAT

01:45:51.511 --> 01:45:52.245
THEY'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO BE

01:45:52.312 --> 01:45:53.714
ABLE TO FUND PUBLIC PURPOSE

01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:54.748
PROGRAMS.

01:45:54.815 --> 01:45:55.916
AND THE CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAM

01:45:55.982 --> 01:45:57.050
SUCH AS CARE THE LOW INCOME

ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS ENERGY

01:45:58.985 --> 01:46:00.487

REBATE PROGRAMS --

01:46:04.991 --> 01:46:07.928
YEP ALSO IMPORTANTLY ON AND I

01:46:07.994 --> 01:46:08.829
THINK IF THEY'RE CLEESE MENTION

01:46:08.895 --> 01:46:10.430
IS A LITTLE BIT AS P. JEANNIE

01:46:10.497 --> 01:46:12.666
WAS GOING INTO BANKRUPTCY --

01:46:12.733 --> 01:46:16.103
WE WORK TO ENSURE THAT ON FUNDS

01:46:16.169 --> 01:46:17.537
THAT ARE SET ASIDE FOR REPAIR

01:46:17.604 --> 01:46:18.972
PER -- OP

CANNOT BE USED AS COLLATERAL

01:46:24.211 --> 01:46:25.679
AGAINST THESE LINES ARE SO FOR

01:46:25.746 --> 01:46:28.248
EXAMPLE I'M IN THIS IS --

01:46:28.315 --> 01:46:29.349
AN ILLUSTRATIVE LET'S NOT THE

01:46:29.416 --> 01:46:31.618

01:46:34.154 --> 01:46:35.388
THOSE CANNOT BE USE FOR

01:46:35.455 --> 01:46:36.723
COLLATERAL AGAINST THE LOAN

01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:38.992
THOSE ARE SAFE TRUST FUNDS --

01:46:39.059 --> 01:46:39.926
FUNDS COLLECTED SUPPORT --

01:46:39.993 --> 01:46:42.162

01:46:44.064 --> 01:46:46.967
SO FOR EXAMPLE ON THE UTILITIES

01:46:47.033 --> 01:46:48.668
WILL OVER COLLECTED EARLY YEAR

01:46:48.735 --> 01:46:49.970
SOME PROGRAMS LIKE THE STUFF

01:46:50.036 --> 01:46:51.838
GENERATION INCENTIVE PROGRAM.

01:46:51.905 --> 01:46:53.540
ON AND THOSE PROGRAMS DAY SET

01:46:53.607 --> 01:46:55.876
ASIDE FOR THAT --

01:46:55.942 --> 01:46:57.978
LANDS THAT HAVE BEEN --

01:46:58.044 --> 01:47:03.183
SET ASIDE ON THE PART ELEMENT

01:47:03.250 --> 01:47:04.618
EASEMENTS THOSE CONTINUE TO BE

01:47:04.684 --> 01:47:06.019
PROTECTED.

01:47:06.086 --> 01:47:07.354
THERE HAVE BEEN IT'S WORTH

01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:09.055
NOTING SOME HICK UPS EARLY ON IN

01:47:09.122 --> 01:47:10.857
BANKRUPTCY --

01:47:10.924 --> 01:47:13.360
THAT WE'VE HAD TO WORK WITH P.

01:47:13.426 --> 01:47:14.494
GINNY TO RESOLVE --

01:47:14.561 --> 01:47:16.963
P. GENIES INSTITUTED A NEW

01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:19.866
SYSTEM OF REVIEWING INVOICES --

01:47:19.933 --> 01:47:20.700
WHICH I THINK CAN BE A LITTLE

01:47:20.767 --> 01:47:21.701
CUMBERSOME --

01:47:21.768 --> 01:47:23.270
AND SO WE'VE HAD TO WORK WITH

01:47:23.336 --> 01:47:24.471
THEM TO MAKE SURE THE CRITICAL

01:47:24.538 --> 01:47:25.772
VENDORS ARE PAID ON TIME THAT

01:47:25.839 --> 01:47:27.207
THIS PROCESS OF REVIEWING THE

01:47:27.274 --> 01:47:29.709
INVOICES DOESN'T SLOW DOWN.

01:47:29.776 --> 01:47:31.311
ON THOSE PAYMENTS --

01:47:31.378 --> 01:47:32.612
OUT THERE --

01:47:32.679 --> 01:47:34.414
WE'VE ALSO HAD A PROBLEM WITH --

01:47:34.481 --> 01:47:35.949
SOME STANDARD FORM CONTRACTS

01:47:36.016 --> 01:47:37.918
THAT EXIST FOR SMALL RENEWABLE

01:47:37.984 --> 01:47:38.852
PROGRAMS --

01:47:38.919 --> 01:47:40.554
RIGHT NOW THAT REALLY IMPACTS

01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:42.189
AND SMALL RENEWABLE BIOMASS

01:47:42.255 --> 01:47:43.423
GENERATORS --

01:47:43.490 --> 01:47:44.991
THE STANDARD FORM CONTRACTS HAVE

01:47:45.058 --> 01:47:46.960
A PROVISION IN THEM THAT --

01:47:47.027 --> 01:47:49.362
REQUIRE THE UTILITY TO CERTIFY

01:47:49.429 --> 01:47:50.931
THAT THEIR FINANCIALLY SOLVENT --

01:47:50.997 --> 01:47:53.567
OBVIOUSLY THE UTILITY CAN'T

01:47:53.633 --> 01:47:56.036
CERTIFY RIGHT THROUGH THE

01:47:56.102 --> 01:47:58.071
PROCESS AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN TO

01:47:58.138 --> 01:47:59.739
HAVE THOSE TERMS REMOVED FROM

01:47:59.806 --> 01:48:01.141
THAT CONTRACTS AT THOSE

01:48:01.208 --> 01:48:02.876
CONTRACTS CAN BE EXECUTED.

01:48:02.943 --> 01:48:04.244
I'M I ANTICIPATED TO BE MORE ONE

01:48:04.311 --> 01:48:06.012
OFF PROBLEMS LIKE THIS ALONG THE

01:48:06.079 --> 01:48:07.881
WAY -- AND

01:48:07.948 --> 01:48:08.515
YOU KNOW WE'RE SETTING UP TO

01:48:08.582 --> 01:48:10.250
DEAL WITH THOSE --

01:48:10.317 --> 01:48:11.985
PROBLEMS --

01:48:12.052 --> 01:48:12.552
YOU KNOW THE REST OF THE

01:48:12.619 --> 01:48:13.920
STATEMENTS --

01:48:13.987 --> 01:48:15.722
I HAD WERE LOOKING AT THE LONG

01:48:15.789 --> 01:48:15.956
TERM --

01:48:16.022 --> 01:48:18.558
IMPACTS HERE ON I THINK.

01:48:18.625 --> 01:48:19.993
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO LOOK

01:48:20.060 --> 01:48:21.962
AT THE LONG TERM IMPACTS IS THE

01:48:22.028 --> 01:48:23.830
PC IS NOT GONNA APPROVE A PLAN.

01:48:23.897 --> 01:48:25.031
ON THAT'S NOT GONNA MAINTAIN

01:48:25.098 --> 01:48:25.932

01:48:25.999 --> 01:48:27.400
OBLIGATION TO MEET THE STATE'S

01:48:27.467 --> 01:48:29.202
CLEAN ENERGY GOALS DOES NOT

01:48:29.269 --> 01:48:30.070
PROVIDE CALIFORNIA WITH A

01:48:30.136 --> 01:48:31.538
RELIABLE RELIABLE AND I THINK

01:48:31.605 --> 01:48:33.106
CRITICALLY AFFORDABLE

01:48:33.173 --> 01:48:34.841
ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS.

01:48:34.908 --> 01:48:36.109

DOWN [inaudible]

01:50:09.002 --> 01:50:10.937
BET.

01:50:11.004 --> 01:50:12.973
WHEN P. GINNY WAS IN BANKRUPTCY

01:50:13.039 --> 01:50:14.341
P. GINNY WAS NO LONGER

01:50:14.407 --> 01:50:16.142
PURCHASING POWER FOR THE

UTILITIES [inaudible]

01:50:17.744 --> 01:50:20.547
ELECTRIC POWER.

01:50:20.613 --> 01:50:22.015
SO WHO WHO'S BEEN PAYING THE W.

01:50:22.082 --> 01:50:25.118

01:50:39.666 --> 01:50:44.170
THERE'S A MAJOR ARM.

01:50:44.237 --> 01:50:45.372
ACTION NOT SURE I THINK IT'S ON

01:50:45.438 --> 01:50:46.139
THE TO BE OURS BOX STILL ON BUT

YEAR D. W. R. PROVIDES THE P.

01:50:48.441 --> 01:50:49.843
YOU SEE WITH A STATEMENT OF WHAT

01:50:49.909 --> 01:50:51.244
IT'S GOING TO COST TO PAY.

01:50:51.311 --> 01:50:52.979
THOSE COSTS FOR THAT YEAR ON THE

01:50:53.046 --> 01:50:54.447
NAY SHOW UP ACTUALLY AS A LINE

01:50:54.514 --> 01:50:56.649
ITEM ON THE UTILITY BILL RIGHT

01:50:56.716 --> 01:50:57.817
NOW -- IN

01:50:57.884 --> 01:51:00.720
THOSE BONDS WILL NOT BE OF THOSE

01:51:00.787 --> 01:51:01.855
COSTS WILL NOT BE PAID OFF IN

01:51:01.921 --> 01:51:03.556
FULL UNTIL.

01:51:03.623 --> 01:51:04.190
TWENTY TWENTY THREE WITH TWO OF

01:51:04.257 --> 01:51:04.824
RESIDUE YES.

01:51:04.891 --> 01:51:06.860
I'M.

01:51:06.926 --> 01:51:11.131
SO MY CONCERN IS THAT --

01:51:11.197 --> 01:51:11.931
WELL MAYBE THE FIRST QUESTION

01:51:11.998 --> 01:51:13.767
WOULD BE.

01:51:13.833 --> 01:51:15.402
WHO WHO ESTABLISHED A POLICY OF

01:51:15.468 --> 01:51:17.670
AB ACQUIRING?

01:51:17.737 --> 01:51:19.873
ELECTRICITY AND GAS ON THE SPOT

01:51:19.939 --> 01:51:22.042
MARKET WHAT WAS THAT AS SEAT

01:51:22.108 --> 01:51:25.078
CPUC REGULATION OR WAS.

01:51:25.145 --> 01:51:26.513
AB.

01:51:26.579 --> 01:51:29.349
EIGHTEEN NINETY SOME OF YOU

01:51:29.416 --> 01:51:29.949
[inaudible]

01:51:30.016 --> 01:51:34.921
REMEMBER THAT.

01:51:34.988 --> 01:51:35.455
RIGHT SO THAT WAS THE DE

01:51:35.522 --> 01:51:38.925
REGULATION --

01:51:38.992 --> 01:51:40.660
AB EIGHTEEN NINETY WAS PART OF

01:51:40.727 --> 01:51:43.430
ELECTRIC RESTRUCTURING AND SET

01:51:43.496 --> 01:51:48.368
UP THE CREATION.

01:51:48.435 --> 01:51:51.504
AND THE POWER EXCHANGE.

01:51:51.571 --> 01:51:54.574
SO THEN THE STATE SORT OF FOR

01:51:54.641 --> 01:51:56.709
HELP CREATE THE AND THAT.

01:51:56.776 --> 01:51:59.913
WELL WE'RE KIND OF INFERRING.

01:51:59.979 --> 01:52:02.048
I THINK THAT MAY BE A SUBJECT

01:52:02.115 --> 01:52:03.983
FOR ANOTHER DAY YEAH A LONG

01:52:04.050 --> 01:52:05.952
HEARING A LOT OF HISTORY.

01:52:06.019 --> 01:52:07.020
YEAH BUT THEN LET ME.

01:52:07.087 --> 01:52:09.022
LET ME.

01:52:09.089 --> 01:52:09.622
MAYBE FOCUS ON WHY I'M ASKING

01:52:09.689 --> 01:52:12.892
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN WORKING ON

01:52:12.959 --> 01:52:14.828
TRYING TO PREVENT WILDFIRES.

01:52:14.894 --> 01:52:16.296
LEGISLATION.

01:52:16.362 --> 01:52:18.264
AND IT HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL

01:52:18.331 --> 01:52:19.466
IN IN A IN MY RESEARCH SHOWS

01:52:19.532 --> 01:52:19.866
THAT.

01:52:19.933 --> 01:52:22.035
THE CPUC AND CAL FIRE TAKEN TEN

01:52:22.102 --> 01:52:24.604
YEARS.

01:52:24.671 --> 01:52:27.273
TO BUILD NOT GET BUYER MAPS DONE --

01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:28.374
AND I'VE GOT COMMUNITIES THAT

01:52:28.441 --> 01:52:30.243
ARE AT RISK THAT.

01:52:30.310 --> 01:52:31.544
SHOULD BE UNDER GROUNDINGOR

01:52:31.611 --> 01:52:34.047
DOING SOMETHING TO PROTECT

01:52:34.114 --> 01:52:37.717
THEMSELVES AND SO I I SINCE MY

01:52:37.784 --> 01:52:39.352
EFFORTS YOU WE'VE HAD. HUNDRED

01:52:39.419 --> 01:52:40.753
TWENTY PEOPLE DIE AND WONDERFUL

01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:42.288
COMMUNITY SO I'M I'M REALLY

01:52:42.355 --> 01:52:43.923
GETTING OLD CONCERNED BECAUSE

01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:46.693
THE CPUC ISN'T DURING THE FIRE

01:52:46.759 --> 01:52:48.094
MAPS IN A TIMELY MANNER.

01:52:48.161 --> 01:52:49.629
AND WE ARE TRYING TO ELECTRIFY

01:52:49.696 --> 01:52:50.763
THIS STATE.

01:52:50.830 --> 01:52:52.298
WE'RE TRYING TO GET.

01:52:52.365 --> 01:52:54.334
COMPANIES TO HAVE.

01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:56.102
ELECTRIC POWERED TRUCKS WHICH

01:52:56.169 --> 01:52:58.238
TAKE HOURS TO RECHARGE RATE AND

01:52:58.304 --> 01:52:59.873
SO MUCH ENERGY WE GOT TO MOVE

01:52:59.939 --> 01:53:01.241
ALL THIS STUFF AROUND STATE.

01:53:01.307 --> 01:53:02.675
AND I'M JUST WONDERING.

01:53:02.742 --> 01:53:04.577
WHERE IS THE LEADERSHIP FROM THE

01:53:04.644 --> 01:53:06.779
CPU SITA TO ADDRESS THESE

01:53:06.846 --> 01:53:08.915
CRITICAL ISSUES WHERE WE'VE BEEN?

01:53:08.982 --> 01:53:11.851
AND WOULD WE HAVE EXPOSURE AS A

01:53:11.918 --> 01:53:13.887
DEEP POCKET TO BE DRAWN INTO.

01:53:13.953 --> 01:53:15.088
THIS [inaudible]

01:53:15.155 --> 01:53:17.157
CHAPTER [inaudible]

01:53:17.223 --> 01:53:19.526
ELEVEN FILE.

01:53:19.592 --> 01:53:20.426
BUT A LOT OF QUESTIONS IN

01:53:20.493 --> 01:53:20.727
[inaudible]

01:53:20.793 --> 01:53:25.198
ONE MAYBE.

01:53:25.265 --> 01:53:25.899
YES I KNOW OUR SINCE YOU'VE BEEN

01:53:25.965 --> 01:53:28.301
THERE AND I CAN I THINK YOU

01:53:28.368 --> 01:53:28.902
UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M TRYING TO

01:53:28.968 --> 01:53:32.739
GET AT I THANK GOD ON THE THE

01:53:32.805 --> 01:53:34.874
TIMING OF THE WITH THE THE WILD

01:53:34.941 --> 01:53:36.476
FOR MAXIMUM BEGINNING ONE OF THE

01:53:36.543 --> 01:53:38.411
THREE OF US ARE IN THE BEST

01:53:38.478 --> 01:53:39.145
POSITION TO ANSWER THAT.

01:53:39.212 --> 01:53:40.079
QUESTION.

01:53:40.146 --> 01:53:42.048
ON THE ON THE QUESTION OF THE

01:53:42.115 --> 01:53:43.383
DEEP POCKETS OF THIS IF THE

01:53:43.449 --> 01:53:45.218
STATE CAN BE BROUGHT INTO IT NOT

01:53:45.285 --> 01:53:46.786
NOT MUST THE STATE WANTS TO GET

01:53:46.853 --> 01:53:48.087
BROUGHT INTO IT --

01:53:48.154 --> 01:53:49.856
YOU KNOW AS FAR AS THE P. GINNY

01:53:49.923 --> 01:53:51.791
BANKRUPTCY.

01:53:51.858 --> 01:53:53.259
NOW AS FAR AS BROADER.

01:53:53.326 --> 01:53:53.993
WILDFIRE LITIGATION I THINK

01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:55.695
THAT'S A QUESTION.

01:53:55.762 --> 01:53:57.430
FOR A DIFFERENT AGENCY.

01:53:57.497 --> 01:53:59.899
SO THEN THE STATE.

01:53:59.966 --> 01:54:01.034
BACK IN --

01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:03.136
TWO WAS BROUGHT INTO IT.

01:54:03.203 --> 01:54:06.272
AS MAYBE A AN AGENT FOR THE

01:54:06.339 --> 01:54:08.641
UTILITIES TO TO TO BORROW MONEY

01:54:08.708 --> 01:54:10.143
TO PAY FOR THAT.

01:54:10.210 --> 01:54:12.512
ELECTRICITY TO GIVE TO THE TO

01:54:12.579 --> 01:54:14.047
THE REPAIRS BY HAVING TO PAY A

01:54:14.113 --> 01:54:15.782
MASSIVE INCREASE IN RATES AND

01:54:15.848 --> 01:54:17.850
THEN IT WAS.

01:54:17.917 --> 01:54:19.786
AMORTIZED OVER A LONG PERIOD OF

01:54:19.852 --> 01:54:22.455
TIME AND SO THAT'S THAT'S BEEN

01:54:22.522 --> 01:54:23.923
RESOLVED BUT IT WAS A BIG.

01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:25.258
WE ALWAYS MEMBERS ARE COMING

01:54:25.325 --> 01:54:27.927
BACK MYSTICAL OR I MEAN I I GRAY

01:54:27.994 --> 01:54:29.696
DAVIS TOOK A PROBLEM TURN IT

01:54:29.762 --> 01:54:31.864
INTO A MESS.

01:54:31.931 --> 01:54:32.966
ANY GOT RECALLED OVER I BELIEVE

01:54:33.032 --> 01:54:34.634
IT WAS ONE OF THE MAJOR FACTORS

01:54:34.701 --> 01:54:35.935
OF WHY HE WAS RECALLED SO THIS

01:54:36.002 --> 01:54:36.536
IS.

01:54:36.603 --> 01:54:37.704
VERY SERIOUS THIS WHOLE P.

01:54:37.770 --> 01:54:39.072
JEANNIE AND HERE WE AREAGAIN

01:54:39.138 --> 01:54:40.907
AND I'M JUST.

01:54:40.974 --> 01:54:41.507
I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE

01:54:41.574 --> 01:54:42.742
THAT AS WERE HERE.

01:54:42.809 --> 01:54:44.210
WE WE'VE LEARNED FROM TWENTY

01:54:44.277 --> 01:54:47.747
YEARS.

01:54:47.814 --> 01:54:48.915
INCOME FOR EVERYBODY ALL ALL THE

01:54:48.982 --> 01:54:50.683
SAME.

01:54:50.750 --> 01:54:52.218
SO THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS MISTER

01:54:52.285 --> 01:54:53.586
CURRENT THANK YOU FOR AT LEAST.

01:54:53.653 --> 01:54:54.988
VETTING BECAUSE IT WAS AN

01:54:55.054 --> 01:54:56.422
INTERESTING TIME AND AND I HAD

01:54:56.489 --> 01:54:58.057
FUND DEALING WITH SOUTHERN

01:54:58.124 --> 01:54:59.125
CALIFORNIA EDISON IN.

01:54:59.192 --> 01:55:00.927
THERE SEE ABOUT THE TIME IS TED

01:55:00.994 --> 01:55:02.729
CRAVER AND THEN HE'S GAME THE C.

01:55:02.795 --> 01:55:04.564
E. O. LATER AND WE JUST HAD A

01:55:04.631 --> 01:55:07.000
LOT OF INTERESTING.

01:55:07.066 --> 01:55:08.835
NOT LIKE JERRY HILL VERSUS BG

01:55:08.901 --> 01:55:10.503
ANYWAY.

01:55:10.570 --> 01:55:11.604
WELL I HOPE THAT THAT.

01:55:11.671 --> 01:55:13.006
THE EXPERIENCE SERVICES WELL

01:55:13.072 --> 01:55:14.107
THIS.

01:55:14.173 --> 01:55:15.775
ONE I WILL GO TO CENTER DOT.

01:55:15.842 --> 01:55:16.476
YEAH I THINK THIS CENTER HILL

01:55:16.542 --> 01:55:17.343
CENTER STERN SO THIS IS A

01:55:17.410 --> 01:55:19.812
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BANKRUPTCY

01:55:19.879 --> 01:55:23.449
THAN THAN WHAT THAT WAS I DON'T

01:55:23.516 --> 01:55:24.851
THINK THE UNDERLYING FACTORS.

01:55:24.917 --> 01:55:25.752
OF THIS BANKRUPTCY PUTS US AT

01:55:25.818 --> 01:55:26.753
ANY RISK OF HAVING.

01:55:26.819 --> 01:55:28.588
YOUR THIS RATE --

01:55:28.655 --> 01:55:32.025
WELL.

01:55:32.091 --> 01:55:35.461
POWER COST --

01:55:35.528 --> 01:55:37.830
YOUR BIG POWER POP COST PROBLEMS

01:55:37.897 --> 01:55:38.998
I THINK WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS

01:55:39.065 --> 01:55:41.434
ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS ALL RIGHT

01:55:41.501 --> 01:55:43.836
I'LL BE QUICK --

01:55:43.903 --> 01:55:46.039
ONE YOU SAID EARLIER THAT --

01:55:46.105 --> 01:55:47.273
CPUC WOULD HAVE.

01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:49.542
TO APPROVE ANY RATE INCREASES

01:55:49.609 --> 01:55:50.743
AND I'M WATER IF THAT ALSO

01:55:50.810 --> 01:55:54.047
APPLIES TO WEAR AND ONE OF THE

01:55:54.113 --> 01:55:55.982
UTILITIES --

01:55:56.049 --> 01:55:58.217
IS DOWNGRADED TO LIFE'S A JUNK

01:55:58.284 --> 01:56:00.453
BOND STATUS.

01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:01.754
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE MAY

01:56:01.821 --> 01:56:04.023
NOT BE CORRECTED THOSE ARE BY

01:56:04.090 --> 01:56:05.725
STATUTE PASSED THROUGH --

01:56:05.792 --> 01:56:07.927
RATE INCREASES AND LIKE A RATE

01:56:07.994 --> 01:56:09.429
INCREASE --

01:56:09.495 --> 01:56:11.164
FOR PROGRAMS THAT THEY HAVE AND

01:56:11.230 --> 01:56:14.000
THEY WANT TO FILE AT A RATE

01:56:14.067 --> 01:56:15.468
INCREASE TO FOLLOW QUESTION.

01:56:15.535 --> 01:56:16.302
I'M.

01:56:16.369 --> 01:56:17.904
I WOULD SAY THE IN THE FIRST

01:56:17.970 --> 01:56:18.938
INSTANCE THAT [inaudible]

01:56:19.005 --> 01:56:20.840
YOU.

01:56:20.907 --> 01:56:23.176
WE WANT OUR UTILITIES TO BE

01:56:23.242 --> 01:56:24.444
INVESTMENT GRADE WE DON'T WANT

01:56:24.510 --> 01:56:26.779
HIM TO BE DOWNGRADED.

01:56:26.846 --> 01:56:28.981
BUT ONE OF THE IMPACTS OF A

01:56:29.048 --> 01:56:30.750
DOWNGRADE THIS IT MAKES THE COST

01:56:30.817 --> 01:56:33.386
OF CAPITAL MORE EXPENSIVE. TO

01:56:33.453 --> 01:56:37.056
BORROW -- SO

01:56:37.123 --> 01:56:39.258
THAT JUST MEANS THAT.

01:56:39.325 --> 01:56:42.028
THOSE COSTS. TO RATEPAYERS ARE

01:56:42.095 --> 01:56:43.196
HIGHER THE BORING BECAUSE

01:56:43.262 --> 01:56:44.397
ACTUALLY SO THAT'S AN AUTOMATIC

01:56:44.464 --> 01:56:46.232
PASSED THROUGH IS THAT WHAT WHAT

01:56:46.299 --> 01:56:46.933
I'M TRYING TO WHAT I'M TRYING TO

01:56:46.999 --> 01:56:48.067
GET AT IS IS.

01:56:48.134 --> 01:56:50.603
EVEN DURING BANKRUPTCY WHILE

01:56:50.670 --> 01:56:53.573
THIS IS ALL GOING ON THE THE

01:56:53.639 --> 01:56:55.975
ENTITY HAS TO CONTINUE TO RUN.

01:56:56.042 --> 01:56:57.844
AND THE COSTS ARE CLEARLY GOING

01:56:57.910 --> 01:56:58.578
UP.

01:56:58.644 --> 01:56:59.545
WHAT I'M ASKING IS IS ARE THOSE

01:56:59.612 --> 01:57:02.582
RATES?

01:57:02.648 --> 01:57:04.417
C. P. YOU SEE HERE IS THAT --

01:57:04.484 --> 01:57:05.918
AND BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT.

01:57:05.985 --> 01:57:08.988
IF IN A GENERAL SENSE IF THE

01:57:09.055 --> 01:57:12.024
UTILITIES BARRING COST GOES UP --

01:57:12.091 --> 01:57:13.826
YEAH THE P. YOU SEE IN SOME

01:57:13.893 --> 01:57:16.562
PROCESS AND ADD IN CALIFORNIA WE

01:57:16.629 --> 01:57:17.296
HAVE -- A

01:57:17.363 --> 01:57:19.399
PRECEDING THAT HAPPENS EVERY

01:57:19.465 --> 01:57:21.000
SEVERAL YEARS THAT WE'RE GONNA

01:57:21.067 --> 01:57:23.836
OPEN ONE THIS YEAR IT'S TEED UP

01:57:23.903 --> 01:57:24.437
TO DETERMINE WHAT THE COST TO

01:57:24.504 --> 01:57:25.671
CAPITAL IT --

01:57:25.738 --> 01:57:26.939
IN AND THEY'RE ALLOWED TO

01:57:27.006 --> 01:57:28.841
RECOVER THAT COST OF CAPITAL AS

01:57:28.908 --> 01:57:29.642
WE DETERMINE THAT.

01:57:29.709 --> 01:57:31.144
A MEAT IS THEORETICAL THAT WE

01:57:31.210 --> 01:57:32.545
COULD SIT THERE AND SAY WE ARE

01:57:32.612 --> 01:57:34.013
GOING ALLOW YOU TO RECOVER THE

01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:35.882
TOTAL COST OF CAPITAL BUT THEN

01:57:35.948 --> 01:57:36.983
IF THEY CAN'T RECOVER IT THEY

01:57:37.049 --> 01:57:38.518
ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BORROW

01:57:38.584 --> 01:57:39.218
AND ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

01:57:39.285 --> 01:57:40.086
PROVIDE SERVICE.

01:57:40.153 --> 01:57:41.687
EXACTLY THEN IT'S NOT ONLY THE

01:57:41.754 --> 01:57:43.356
COST OF CAPITAL IT'S ALSO THE

01:57:43.423 --> 01:57:46.025
COST OF CONTRACTS FOR LIKE WE

01:57:46.092 --> 01:57:47.860
NEW BULLS WHERE DID SWER.

01:57:47.927 --> 01:57:50.029
AND SOME OF THOSE THINGS AND SO

01:57:50.096 --> 01:57:52.932
YEAH I JUST THINK IT'S FAIR TO

01:57:52.999 --> 01:57:53.900
HAVE THAT.

01:57:53.966 --> 01:57:54.634
UNDERSTANDING THAT.

01:57:54.700 --> 01:57:55.568
DURING THIS PROCESS AND ALSO

01:57:55.635 --> 01:57:56.369

OWNED UTILITIES THERE.

01:58:00.673 --> 01:58:01.808

01:58:01.874 --> 01:58:03.042

01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:04.911
WANTS TO SAY IT BUT I'D YOU KNOW

01:58:04.977 --> 01:58:07.713

INTERVENTION THERE ARE IMPACTS --

01:58:11.284 --> 01:58:12.819
TO OUR RATE PAYERS AND I THINK

01:58:12.885 --> 01:58:14.353
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED.

01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:16.088
TO PAY ATTENTION TO ONE FINAL

01:58:16.155 --> 01:58:17.957

01:58:42.315 --> 01:58:45.952
UNDERSTANDING OF OF THAT SOUNDS

01:58:46.018 --> 01:58:48.955
A LOT MORE ALARMING THAN MAYBE.

01:58:49.021 --> 01:58:51.491
IT IS --

01:58:51.557 --> 01:58:53.226

THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS HOW

01:59:55.988 --> 01:59:57.690

02:00:20.079 --> 02:00:21.714
THEIR CURRENT ASSESSMENT IS OF

02:00:21.781 --> 02:00:24.150
WHAT THEIR OUTSTANDING LIABILITY

02:00:24.216 --> 02:00:25.384

02:02:02.048 --> 02:02:02.948
KNOW THE PRICE.

02:02:03.015 --> 02:02:04.884
BEFORE YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO

02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:05.384
SOMETHING --

02:02:43.656 --> 02:02:44.990
MONEY --

02:02:45.057 --> 02:02:47.026

YOU'RE ASKING IS THE SAME

02:03:10.850 --> 02:03:12.384

THEY WENT INTO BANKRUPTCY.

02:03:14.353 --> 02:03:16.255
WHEN THE NEW PHASE OF THE SAFETY

THAT IS THE VENUE WHERE WE HAVE --

02:03:46.619 --> 02:03:48.854
A VERY PUBLIC CONVERSATION ABOUT

02:03:57.129 --> 02:03:58.798
WITH THEIR CHALLENGES IN ONE OF

02:03:58.864 --> 02:04:00.499
THE THINGS THAT --

02:04:00.566 --> 02:04:01.767
AND I APPRECIATE HEARING THAT.

02:04:01.834 --> 02:04:03.335
I'M KIND OF A RECOGNITION OF THE

02:04:03.402 --> 02:04:05.838
PROBLEM --

02:04:05.905 --> 02:04:07.473
AND YOU KNOW WE WE'VE JUST SEEN

JEANNIE.

02:04:09.008 --> 02:04:11.377
IDENTIFY A TRANSMISSION TOWER

02:04:11.443 --> 02:04:13.946
PROBLEM THAT THE TAKING SOME

02:04:14.013 --> 02:04:16.482
RESPONSIBILITY FOR IN TERMS OF

02:04:16.549 --> 02:04:17.817
THEIR EQUIPMENT --

02:04:17.883 --> 02:04:18.350
BUT THEN WE LOOK AT THE

02:04:18.417 --> 02:04:20.786
INSPECTIONS THAT P. JEANNIE

02:04:20.853 --> 02:04:22.188
CONDUCTED OF THESE TOWERS

02:04:22.254 --> 02:04:24.256
HISTORICALLY AND THERE SEEMS TO

02:04:24.323 --> 02:04:26.525
BE A LACKS OF A LACK OF OF

02:04:26.592 --> 02:04:28.961
CONTINUITY AND OF EXPERTISE DONE

02:04:29.028 --> 02:04:30.796
WITH THAT.

02:04:30.863 --> 02:04:31.664
AND WHAT WE FIND IS THE SELF

02:04:31.730 --> 02:04:32.998
SELF REGULATION AND SELF

02:04:33.065 --> 02:04:35.167
MONITORING ITSELF AUDITING AND

02:04:35.234 --> 02:04:36.702
THE CHALLENGE WITH THAT.

02:04:36.769 --> 02:04:38.404
I KNOW IF IF IF IF A UTILITY IS

02:04:38.470 --> 02:04:41.240
DOING A GOOD JOB WE EXPECT THEM

02:04:41.307 --> 02:04:42.775
TO TO MONITOR THAT AND AND DO A

02:04:42.842 --> 02:04:44.643
GOOD JOB BUT WHEN WHAT WE'VE

02:04:44.710 --> 02:04:46.245
SEEN IS THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE

02:04:46.312 --> 02:04:48.848
CASE WITH P. JEANNIE --

02:04:48.914 --> 02:04:52.852
HE AND IN THAT CALLS FOR

02:04:52.918 --> 02:04:55.054
INSPECTING THEIR WORK IS THAT

02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:57.890
CONTEMPLATED [inaudible]

02:04:57.957 --> 02:05:00.059
YES.

02:05:00.125 --> 02:05:00.893
YES -- IN

02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:02.661
FACT I AM WORKING VERY CLOSELY

02:05:02.728 --> 02:05:05.698
RIGHT NOW WITH MY ENFORCEMENT --

02:05:05.764 --> 02:05:06.832
DIRECTOR DEPUTY DIRECTOR LIZ

02:05:06.899 --> 02:05:09.602
VITA MALASHENKO ON THIS AND WE

02:05:09.668 --> 02:05:12.238
ARE LOOKING AT IT AND WE HAVE TO

02:05:12.304 --> 02:05:13.839
MAKE CHANGES.

02:05:13.906 --> 02:05:16.942
BECAUSE WE ARE RELIANT ON THE

02:05:17.009 --> 02:05:18.611
YLIDES TO DO WHAT WE'RE TELLING

02:05:18.677 --> 02:05:20.946
THEM IN MANDATING AND REGULATING

02:05:21.013 --> 02:05:22.081
THEM TO DO.

02:05:22.147 --> 02:05:23.382
SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY DON'T

02:05:23.449 --> 02:05:24.850
DO IT AND YOU FIND THEM.

02:05:24.917 --> 02:05:26.085
AND THEN YOU FIND THEM AGAIN.

02:05:26.151 --> 02:05:28.087
AND AGAIN.

02:05:28.153 --> 02:05:30.022
SO WHAT DO WE HAVE SOME.

02:05:30.089 --> 02:05:30.990
WE'VE GOT TO COME UP WITH A

02:05:31.056 --> 02:05:32.925
DIFFERENT SOLUTION.

02:05:32.992 --> 02:05:34.360

KNOW WHAT CAN WE DEAL FROM WITH

02:05:40.966 --> 02:05:41.901
TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE DO I NEED TO

02:05:41.967 --> 02:05:44.503
HIRE THREE HUNDRED INVESTIGATORS.

02:05:44.570 --> 02:05:46.272
I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE ANSWER

02:05:46.338 --> 02:05:48.474
BUT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING.

02:05:48.540 --> 02:05:50.175

ACTUALLY SOMETHING MUCH MORE

02:06:19.471 --> 02:06:21.373
DIFFICULT IN THIS CASE WHICH IS

02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:23.142
TO ENSURE SAFE UTILITY.

02:06:23.208 --> 02:06:25.044
AND NOT ABANDON ALL OF OUR

I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT --

02:06:33.986 --> 02:06:36.121
YEAH THE PUBLIC PURPOSES OF

02:06:36.188 --> 02:06:38.824
BEING LEFT BEHIND THROUGH THIS

02:06:38.891 --> 02:06:39.425
BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING SO FIRST

TO GET THE STAYS ON ON OUR

02:06:53.605 --> 02:06:55.040
PUBLIC PURPOSE PROGRAMS I THINK

02:06:55.107 --> 02:06:55.407
THAT.

02:06:55.474 --> 02:06:56.275
I WOULD'VE BEEN VERY DANGEROUS

02:06:56.342 --> 02:06:57.910
PRECEDENT --

02:06:57.977 --> 02:06:59.545
SO WE'LL BE KEEPING AN EYE ON

02:06:59.611 --> 02:07:01.647
THAT BUT WE APPRECIATE THAT OR I

02:07:01.714 --> 02:07:02.381
CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT

02:07:02.448 --> 02:07:03.949
POSITION --

02:07:04.016 --> 02:07:05.651
BUT IN TERMS OF THIS QUESTION OF

02:07:05.718 --> 02:07:07.386
HE DID.

02:07:07.453 --> 02:07:09.021
ADEQUATELY CONTINUE TO PUSH

YOU'VE GOT.

02:07:14.426 --> 02:07:15.928
A GENERAL RATE CASE IT'S BEEN

02:07:15.995 --> 02:07:18.530
SITTING THERE --

02:07:18.597 --> 02:07:19.698
FOR I DON'T KNOW HOW HOW LONG

02:07:19.765 --> 02:07:21.567
EDISON'S CASES BEEN BEFORE THE

02:07:21.633 --> 02:07:24.236
COMMISSION BUT A WHILE --

HI I KNOW THAT THIS IS SOMEWHAT

02:07:26.038 --> 02:07:27.973
OF A BUDGET COM QUESTION BECAUSE

BCP'S HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED AND

02:07:29.341 --> 02:07:30.642
YOU ARE ASKING FOR STAFF

02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:33.045

02:07:33.112 --> 02:07:33.879
DOWN.

02:07:33.946 --> 02:07:35.948
TO DRINK YOUR QUESTIONS OF LAW

02:07:36.015 --> 02:07:37.383
LIKE I MEAN THERE'S A THERE'S A

02:07:37.449 --> 02:07:39.918
PIPELINE THAT SEPARATE HADN'T

02:07:39.985 --> 02:07:40.619
UPGRADED.

02:07:40.686 --> 02:07:41.920
FOR I THINK OVER A YEAR SINCE IT

02:07:41.987 --> 02:07:43.789
RUPTURED THAT NAY WAS NO REMOTE

02:07:43.856 --> 02:07:46.425
SENSING CAPABILITY FOR IT --

02:07:46.492 --> 02:07:48.027
DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO

02:07:48.093 --> 02:07:49.862
EVEN IF YOU HAD --

02:07:49.928 --> 02:07:51.363
IN ALL THE NEW TECH IN THE WORLD

02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:53.799
LIKE THAT OLD PIPE UNDERGROUND

02:07:53.866 --> 02:07:54.800
IS PRETTY TOUGH TO FIGURE OUT

02:07:54.867 --> 02:07:56.902
WHAT'S WRONG UNTIL IT SOMETHING

02:07:56.969 --> 02:07:58.837
GOES REALLY BAD --

02:07:58.904 --> 02:08:00.005
AND THERE ARE NONE OF THE REMOTE

02:08:00.072 --> 02:08:01.573
SENSING PICKED IT UP AND YET NOW

02:08:01.640 --> 02:08:03.042
HOSTS SEVEN CALIFORNIA'S.

02:08:03.108 --> 02:08:04.610
ELECTRIC RATE FACE IS GONNA TAKE

02:08:04.676 --> 02:08:06.712
A HIT FOR THAT FOR HAVING SUPPLY

02:08:06.779 --> 02:08:09.081
CONSTRAINTS IN THAT BASIN.

02:08:09.148 --> 02:08:11.050

02:08:27.132 --> 02:08:28.067
YES.

02:08:28.133 --> 02:08:29.868
THIS IS A LITTLE INHERENTLY

02:08:29.935 --> 02:08:31.703
SKEPTICAL I GUESS AT THIS POINT.

02:08:31.770 --> 02:08:33.105
WE WOULD APPRECIATE THAT THAT

02:08:33.172 --> 02:08:34.206
SKEPTICISM ON BEHALF ALL THE

02:08:34.273 --> 02:08:37.342
REPAIRS ARE CONSTITUENTS.

02:08:37.409 --> 02:08:38.811

02:08:51.723 --> 02:08:53.225
KNOW JUST THINK THIS TAKE

02:08:53.292 --> 02:08:54.726
TELEPHONE POLES FOR EXAMPLE.

02:08:54.793 --> 02:08:56.228

02:08:57.830 --> 02:08:59.631
ARE THERE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:08:59.698 --> 02:09:00.232
HOW MANY IGNITION SOURCES IS

02:09:00.299 --> 02:09:01.633
THAT?

02:09:01.700 --> 02:09:03.469
AND WHO OWNS THOSE POLLS THE

02:09:03.535 --> 02:09:05.204
UTILITIES AND THEN YOU HAVE THE

02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:07.005
CA TELECOMS WHO HAVE A PIECE OF

02:09:07.072 --> 02:09:08.907
THE POLE AND AND THEN YOU GOT

02:09:08.974 --> 02:09:11.276
FIVE G. COMING ON WHO'S GOING.

02:09:11.343 --> 02:09:12.911
TO CREATE THIS GIANT.

02:09:12.978 --> 02:09:13.979
IS TO PUT ON THE POLE AND WHAT

02:09:14.046 --> 02:09:15.047
DOES THAT DO AND AND HOW DOES

02:09:15.114 --> 02:09:17.149
THAT IMPACT SAFETY BECAUSE NOW

02:09:17.216 --> 02:09:18.984
YOU HAVE MORE ON THAT POLE SO WE

02:09:19.051 --> 02:09:21.019
ARE I MEAN THIS IS THE LEVEL OF

02:09:21.086 --> 02:09:25.124
DETAIL IN THE THINGS THAT WE'RELOOKING AT BECAUSE WE HAVE.

02:09:25.190 --> 02:09:28.160
TO AND THAT ELECTRIC THAT'S GAS

02:09:28.227 --> 02:09:29.995
DON'T FORGET WE REGULATE UBER

02:09:30.062 --> 02:09:32.798
AND LIFT AND TOUR BUSES AND

02:09:32.865 --> 02:09:34.900
WATER RATES AND RAIL FOR

02:09:34.967 --> 02:09:37.569
CALIFORNIA I MEAN THIS ISN'T

02:09:37.636 --> 02:09:38.704
JUST ONE AREA.

02:09:38.770 --> 02:09:40.506

THROWING RESOURCES IN MORE

02:09:49.014 --> 02:09:50.215
POSITIONS ISN'T NECESSARILY THE

02:25:48.639 --> 02:25:52.777
AT P. GINNY FOR CONTRACTORS --

02:25:52.844 --> 02:25:55.046
WE WERE HERE I WAS HERE IN TWO

02:25:55.113 --> 02:25:55.680
THOUSAND ONE WITH THAT

02:25:55.746 --> 02:25:56.581
BANKRUPTCY IN.

02:25:56.647 --> 02:25:58.883
I THINK THE ONLY REAL SIMILARITY

02:25:58.950 --> 02:26:00.985
IS DRIVEN BY POLICY --

02:26:01.052 --> 02:26:02.987
THAT WAS DRIVEN BY.

02:26:03.054 --> 02:26:04.722
DE REGULATION WHERE.

02:26:04.789 --> 02:26:07.792
EACH IN THE COULD ONLY CHARGE SO

02:26:07.859 --> 02:26:09.193
MUCH FOR WHAT THEY WERE SELLING

02:26:09.260 --> 02:26:11.129
ACTUALLY ALL UTILITIES.

02:26:11.195 --> 02:26:12.930
AND BECAUSE OF THE REGULATION

02:26:12.997 --> 02:26:14.599
AND RON IN THE CITY OF READING

02:26:14.665 --> 02:26:16.434
AND W. P. WE'RE ALL GAMING THE

02:26:16.501 --> 02:26:19.070
SYSTEM SO THEY WERE BUYING HERE

02:26:19.137 --> 02:26:21.806
BUYING HI SELLING LOW.

02:26:21.873 --> 02:26:23.474
THAT WAS A POLICY FAILURE ON

02:26:23.541 --> 02:26:27.145
THEIR SOME POLICY FAILURES HERE --

02:26:27.211 --> 02:26:28.980
YOUR HONOR ON THE ONE HAND IT'S

02:26:29.046 --> 02:26:30.248
COMPLICATED I PREPARED AS A

02:26:30.314 --> 02:26:34.051
VISUAL AID FOR OUR MEMBERS --

02:26:34.118 --> 02:26:39.991
MAN.

02:26:40.057 --> 02:26:43.161
WE WE COULD DO THAT JUST AS WELL

02:26:43.227 --> 02:26:43.394
AS WELL.

02:26:43.461 --> 02:26:46.631
THE FIRST ROUND [inaudible]

02:26:46.697 --> 02:26:50.902
PRETTY -- SO

02:26:50.968 --> 02:26:52.036
IN THE CENTER ARE THE ESSENTIAL

02:26:52.103 --> 02:26:54.906
CLAIMS -- IN

02:26:54.972 --> 02:26:57.108
SUCH AS THE TWO THOUSAND

02:26:57.175 --> 02:26:58.242
SEVENTEEN CLAIMS EIGHTEEN CLAIMS.

02:26:58.309 --> 02:26:59.844
ARE THE IN THE IN THE ISSUES IN

02:26:59.911 --> 02:27:01.212
PLAY.

02:27:01.279 --> 02:27:03.314
THE ORANGE CIRCLE ARE THE PLACES

02:27:03.381 --> 02:27:05.216
WHERE IT'S BEING FOUGHT.

02:27:05.283 --> 02:27:06.651
ALTHOUGH WHEN I MADE THIS WE

02:27:06.717 --> 02:27:08.486
DIDN'T HAVE THE SIXTY DAY STRIKE

02:27:08.553 --> 02:27:09.820
FORCE BY THE GOVERNOR.

02:27:09.887 --> 02:27:13.424
AND THEN ON THE OUTSIDE OR THE

02:27:13.491 --> 02:27:14.625
MAJOR INTERESTED PARTIES.

02:27:14.692 --> 02:27:17.094
AND THIS JUST SHOWS HOW

02:27:17.161 --> 02:27:19.830
INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED IT IS.

02:27:19.897 --> 02:27:22.166
AND THE MATHEMATICIANS HERE CAN

02:27:22.233 --> 02:27:23.601
FIGURE OUT.

02:27:23.668 --> 02:27:25.002
HOW MANY DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS

02:27:25.069 --> 02:27:28.005
OF THIS THERE ARE --

02:27:28.072 --> 02:27:30.107
IT'S VERY VERY COMPLEX WE WE WE

02:27:30.174 --> 02:27:32.743
HEARD THAT FROM.

02:27:32.810 --> 02:27:32.977
FROM --

02:27:33.044 --> 02:27:35.413
PROFESSOR AND NOT FROM HASTINGS.

02:27:35.479 --> 02:27:36.681
ON THE ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S

02:27:36.747 --> 02:27:39.050
IT'S FAIRLY PART OF IT'S VERY

02:27:39.116 --> 02:27:40.117
SIMPLE.

02:27:40.184 --> 02:27:44.322
AND THAT IS FOR FOR P. JEANNIE

02:27:44.388 --> 02:27:45.756
TO EMERGE FROM BANKRUPTCY.

02:27:45.823 --> 02:27:47.458
THE PLAYGROUND CAN'T BE THE SAME

02:27:47.525 --> 02:27:48.793
THE THE PLAYING FIELD CANNOT BE

02:27:48.859 --> 02:27:50.394
THE SAME THERE HAS TO BE A

02:27:50.461 --> 02:27:53.731
FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE OR TWO THERE.

02:27:53.798 --> 02:27:55.566
HAVE TO BE CHANGES IN P. JEANNIE.

02:27:55.633 --> 02:27:57.134
BUT THERE HAS TO BE A CHANGE

02:27:57.201 --> 02:28:00.972
EITHER IN LIABILITY OR IN.

02:28:01.038 --> 02:28:04.742
THE FUNDING AND AGREE AGREE THE

02:28:04.809 --> 02:28:06.911
STAKEHOLDERS IS LET'S NOT FOCUS

02:28:06.978 --> 02:28:08.012
ON INVERSE.

02:28:08.079 --> 02:28:09.914
AND STRICT LIABILITY LET'S FOCUS

02:28:09.981 --> 02:28:13.517
ON ON A RISK POOLS SUCH AS BUT

02:28:13.584 --> 02:28:15.953
FLORIDA DOES WITH HURRICANES.

02:28:16.020 --> 02:28:17.722
ARE SO IT'S HOW WE PAY --

02:28:17.788 --> 02:28:20.658
RATHER THAN WHAT THE BAR IS TO

02:28:20.725 --> 02:28:20.858
PAY.

02:28:20.925 --> 02:28:22.994
NOTE IT CLEARLY HAS TO BE A

02:28:23.060 --> 02:28:24.195
SOLUTION THAT'S GOING TO HAVE

02:28:24.262 --> 02:28:25.529
THE SUPPORT OF ALMOST EVERY

02:28:25.596 --> 02:28:27.265
MAJOR PARTIES NOT EVERY MAJOR

02:28:27.331 --> 02:28:29.700
PARTY -- BUT

02:28:29.767 --> 02:28:31.602
IT OCCURS TO ME THAT UTILITIES

02:28:31.669 --> 02:28:34.338
ARE RISK AVERSE BY BY DEFINITION.

02:28:34.405 --> 02:28:36.641
AND I THINK THAT THE COMMISSION

02:28:36.707 --> 02:28:38.142
HAS BEEN RISK AVERSE AND THAT

02:28:38.209 --> 02:28:39.076
THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN RISK

02:28:39.143 --> 02:28:41.112
AVERSE.

02:28:41.178 --> 02:28:43.080
AND IF WE'RE GONNA GET OUT OF

02:28:43.147 --> 02:28:45.149
THIS JAM THAT WERE AND HAS NOT

02:28:45.216 --> 02:28:46.684
JUST P. JEANNIE IT'S NOT JUST

02:28:46.751 --> 02:28:48.119
INVESTOR OWNS THE PUBLIC ON

02:28:48.185 --> 02:28:50.254
PUBLIC LOAN UTILITIES.

02:28:50.321 --> 02:28:51.989
ARE IN THE SAME SPOT.

02:28:52.056 --> 02:28:53.524
MEAN SMART READING PALO ALTO

02:28:53.591 --> 02:28:56.961
THEY'RE ALL THERE --

02:28:57.028 --> 02:28:57.194
WHERE?

02:28:57.261 --> 02:28:58.863
I MEAN IF THE CAR FIRE HAD BEEN

02:28:58.929 --> 02:29:00.831
STARTED BY THE CITY OF READING.

02:29:00.898 --> 02:29:03.768
RATHER THAN A SPARK OFTEN AXLE

02:29:03.834 --> 02:29:04.935
CITY READING OF THE BANKRUPT

02:29:05.002 --> 02:29:08.005
TODAY.

02:29:08.072 --> 02:29:08.272
SO -- WE

02:29:08.339 --> 02:29:10.341
NEED WE NEED TO WE NEED TO SOLVE

02:29:10.408 --> 02:29:11.342
THAT NOW I'LL JUST MAKE ONE

02:29:11.409 --> 02:29:12.677
OBSERVATION --

02:29:12.743 --> 02:29:14.812
ABOUT WHAT BANKRUPTCY HAS DONE

02:29:14.879 --> 02:29:16.314
AND IT HAS.

02:29:16.380 --> 02:29:18.983
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE ROLE

02:29:19.050 --> 02:29:20.718
OF HEDGE FUNDS AND CALIFORNIA

02:29:20.785 --> 02:29:23.321
UTILITIES --

02:29:23.387 --> 02:29:24.622
YEAH I THINK THAT TWO YEARS AGO

02:29:24.689 --> 02:29:25.589
AT THIS POINT.

02:29:25.656 --> 02:29:29.126
HEDGE FUNDS OWN 2% OF P. GENIES

02:29:29.193 --> 02:29:29.527
STOCK.

02:29:29.593 --> 02:29:32.129
TODAY DOWN 52%.

02:29:32.196 --> 02:29:33.998
AND I THINK THAT --

02:29:34.065 --> 02:29:36.367
THERE ARE NEGOTIATIONS GOING ON

02:29:36.434 --> 02:29:37.268
RIGHT NOW.

02:29:37.335 --> 02:29:38.502
GINNY'S THOUGHT THAT THEY'D SWAP

02:29:38.569 --> 02:29:42.073
OUT MEMBERS THE BOARD RECORD

02:29:42.139 --> 02:29:43.207
HIGH THAT'S OUT THE WINDOW THEY

02:29:43.274 --> 02:29:45.276

AND THE HEDGE FUNDS ARE ARE

02:29:49.080 --> 02:29:49.880
JOCKEYING.

02:29:49.947 --> 02:29:51.415
HEAD TURNS PLAY A USEFUL ROLE

02:29:51.482 --> 02:29:53.050
BUT WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THE ONLY

02:29:53.117 --> 02:29:56.420
FOCUSES FINANCIAL --

02:29:56.487 --> 02:29:57.988

GREENHOUSE GAS --

02:44:47.677 --> 02:44:48.245
OBVIOUSLY THE CAUSE OF THIS

02:44:48.311 --> 02:44:49.713
BANKRUPTCY IS NOT THEIR

02:44:49.779 --> 02:44:50.380

02:45:33.990 --> 02:45:35.725
THERE'S ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED OF

02:45:35.792 --> 02:45:37.227
ENERGY STORAGE THESE ARE ALL THE

02:45:37.294 --> 02:45:38.595
ADDRESS THERE THAT TO ADDRESS

02:45:38.662 --> 02:45:40.230
EITHER OUR PS OR KEEPING THE

02:45:40.297 --> 02:45:41.464
LIGHTS ON SO THEY'RE THEY'RE

02:45:41.531 --> 02:45:42.766
VERY IMPORTANT.

02:45:42.832 --> 02:45:44.401
THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THIS OVER

02:45:44.467 --> 02:45:45.235
TO YOU KNOW THE NEXT TWENTY

02:45:45.302 --> 02:45:46.936
YEARS OR WHATEVER COULD BE A

02:45:47.003 --> 02:45:47.971
SIZE FORTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS

02:45:48.038 --> 02:45:49.372
ACCORDING TO PGD DARKNESS THEY

02:45:49.439 --> 02:45:50.307
FILED SO IT'S NOT AN

02:45:50.373 --> 02:45:51.975
INCONSEQUENTIAL NUMBER.

02:45:52.042 --> 02:45:53.543
BUT THESE ARE PASSED THROUGH

02:45:53.610 --> 02:45:54.644
COSTS SO --

02:45:54.711 --> 02:45:55.412
TERMINATING THESE CONTRACTS

02:45:55.478 --> 02:45:57.213
DOESN'T ADD ANY MONEY TO THE

02:45:57.280 --> 02:45:58.281
POOL OF MONEY THAT P. JEANNIE

02:45:58.348 --> 02:46:00.417
COULD PAY OTHER PEOPLE IN FACT

02:46:00.483 --> 02:46:01.685
OBVIOUSLY I HAVE CONCERNS

02:46:01.751 --> 02:46:03.253
REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE THE

02:46:03.320 --> 02:46:04.621
COUNTERPART IS THOSE CONTRACTS

02:46:04.688 --> 02:46:05.722
IS PRETTY OBVIOUS.

02:46:05.789 --> 02:46:07.624
BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BE CONCERNED

02:46:07.691 --> 02:46:09.025
WELL ASSUMING THEY REJECT

02:46:09.092 --> 02:46:10.694
CONTRACTS THAT'S NOT THE END OF

02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:11.928
THE STORY --

02:46:11.995 --> 02:46:14.931
BASICALLY THE REJECTED CONTRACTS --

02:46:14.998 --> 02:46:19.102
BASICALLY HAVE VARIOUS DAMAGES

02:46:19.169 --> 02:46:22.038
CLAY THE POOL A LUNCH THE FIRE

02:46:22.105 --> 02:46:26.576
VERY ELSE THIS IS THESE ARE

02:46:26.643 --> 02:46:28.211
NUMBERS I'M JUST MAKING UP IF

02:46:28.278 --> 02:46:29.713
I'M SMART NEW SOLAR.

02:46:29.779 --> 02:46:31.081
AND BY CONTRACT HAS BEEN

02:46:31.147 --> 02:46:32.182
TERMINATED --

02:46:32.248 --> 02:46:33.116
THEY ARE A BIG SHOULD BE

02:46:33.183 --> 02:46:35.051
REJECTED IS IS THE ACTUAL WORD

02:46:35.118 --> 02:46:36.252
THAT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

02:46:36.319 --> 02:46:37.954
GOES INTO THIS POOL RIGHT IT

02:46:38.021 --> 02:46:38.788
EVEN IF THEY'RE ONLY PAYING

02:46:38.855 --> 02:46:40.223
FIFTY SET AT FENCE FIFTY CENTS

02:46:40.290 --> 02:46:40.924
ON A DOLLAR.

02:46:40.990 --> 02:46:42.092
OR THIRTY FIVE CENTS ON THE

02:46:42.158 --> 02:46:43.693
DOLLAR THAT'S LESS MONEY FOR THE

02:46:43.760 --> 02:46:45.095
FIRE VICTIMS AND EVERYBODY ELSE

02:46:45.161 --> 02:46:46.763
THERE SO THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A BIG

02:46:46.830 --> 02:46:48.064
PROBLEM IS SOMETHING THAT.

02:46:48.131 --> 02:46:49.299
PEOPLE WANT TO CONSIDER THE

02:46:49.366 --> 02:46:51.401
SECOND PIECE IS IMPORTANT IN AND

02:46:51.468 --> 02:46:52.602
THIS WAS SORT OF SUGGESTED

02:46:52.669 --> 02:46:53.870
EARLIER --

02:46:53.937 --> 02:46:55.438
IS THE WHOLE WORLD WATCHING HOW

02:46:55.505 --> 02:46:56.806
WE DEAL WITH THIS AND SO

02:46:56.873 --> 02:46:59.142
BASICALLY OF A LOT OF MONEY

02:46:59.209 --> 02:47:00.610
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS GAME HERE TO

02:47:00.677 --> 02:47:02.112
BUILD THIS INFRASTRUCTURE --

02:47:02.178 --> 02:47:05.081
AND AND IF IN FACT WHAT ENDS UP

02:47:05.148 --> 02:47:06.316
HAPPENING IS WE START

02:47:06.383 --> 02:47:08.017
TERMINATING CONTRACTS IN THE IN

02:47:08.084 --> 02:47:09.886
A BASED ON THOSE INVESTMENTS --

02:47:09.953 --> 02:47:11.454
IN TERMS OF MODERNIZING IT WHAT

02:47:11.521 --> 02:47:13.356
IS THAT SAVE FOR THE FUTURE OKAY

02:47:13.423 --> 02:47:14.157
AND I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF

02:47:14.224 --> 02:47:16.326
BILLS ARE FLOAT AROUND THAT WE

02:47:16.393 --> 02:47:17.594
HAVE EVEN MORE INTERESTING NEW

02:47:17.660 --> 02:47:19.062
TECHNOLOGIES COMING.

02:47:19.129 --> 02:47:20.830
THAT TODAY ARE GOING TO BE MUCH

02:47:20.897 --> 02:47:21.898
HIGHER COSTS THAN THEY ARE TEN

02:47:21.965 --> 02:47:23.366
YEARS FROM NOW BUT IF WE GET THE

02:47:23.433 --> 02:47:24.868
REPUTATION OF THAT BASICALLY

02:47:24.934 --> 02:47:26.403
BEING ABLE TO KEEP OUR CONTRACTS.

02:47:26.469 --> 02:47:27.437
THAT'S GONNA HAVE A NEGATIVE

02:47:27.504 --> 02:47:29.005
EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT

02:47:29.072 --> 02:47:30.974
FUTURE CAPITAL FOR ALL THE OTHER

02:47:31.040 --> 02:47:32.842
WONDERFUL THINGS WE WANT TO DO --

02:47:32.909 --> 02:47:33.977
SO I THINK THAT --

02:47:34.043 --> 02:47:35.278
THAT THAT'S REALLY KIND OF AT

02:47:35.345 --> 02:47:36.846
THE KEY TO IT THE KEY OF WHAT WE

02:47:36.913 --> 02:47:38.248
WANTED TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IS

02:47:38.314 --> 02:47:39.816
THE IMPACTS OF THAT.

02:47:39.883 --> 02:47:41.017
ON A BROADER RANGE.

02:47:41.084 --> 02:47:44.854
HAVING SAID THAT IT'S OBVIOUSLY

02:47:44.921 --> 02:47:48.992
VERY FOCUSED I TRIED TO MAKE

02:47:49.058 --> 02:47:50.293
SURE -- WE

02:47:50.360 --> 02:47:52.729
MINIMIZE THE FIRE DAMAGE --

02:47:52.796 --> 02:47:54.030
THIS ADULTS ALL TALKED ABOUT YOU

02:47:54.097 --> 02:47:55.899
KNOW INSURANCE POOLS OTHER KINDS

02:47:55.965 --> 02:47:57.167
OF THINGS I MAY THINK YOU HEARD

02:47:57.233 --> 02:47:58.768
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABOUT THE

02:47:58.835 --> 02:47:59.302
IMPACTS OF THIS ON THEIR

02:47:59.369 --> 02:48:01.204
COMMUNITIES WE HAVE TO KIND OF

02:48:01.271 --> 02:48:03.440
WEEK THAT KIND OF FIX IS WE HAVE

02:48:03.506 --> 02:48:04.140
TO FIX THIS.

02:48:04.207 --> 02:48:05.608
AGAIN ABOUT A BROADER THINGS AND

02:48:05.675 --> 02:48:06.676
I THINK THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO

02:48:06.743 --> 02:48:08.378
BE VERY BUSY ON THINGS THAT ARE

02:48:08.445 --> 02:48:09.679
NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE

02:48:09.746 --> 02:48:11.414
BANKRUPTCY IN TERMS OF ALL THE

02:48:11.481 --> 02:48:12.315
INTERESTING.

02:48:12.382 --> 02:48:13.483
MACHINATIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING

02:48:13.550 --> 02:48:14.851
THERE AND HAVING TO DRESS THAT

02:48:14.918 --> 02:48:16.352
AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING

02:48:16.419 --> 02:48:17.787
WITH THIS COMMITTEE IN THE REST

02:48:17.854 --> 02:48:18.354
OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE

02:48:18.421 --> 02:48:19.088
GOVERNOR.

02:48:19.155 --> 02:48:20.957
WELL I THINK IT'S BEEN VERY --

02:48:21.024 --> 02:48:22.592
VERY HELPFUL IN TERMS OF A MOVIE

02:48:22.659 --> 02:48:24.394
HIS STRIKING FORWARD AND I THINK

02:48:24.461 --> 02:48:26.062
GATHERED THAT THIS THE FIRST

02:48:26.129 --> 02:48:26.996
STEPS THAT WERE TAKEN LAST YEAR

02:48:27.063 --> 02:48:27.530
AND SB.

02:48:27.597 --> 02:48:28.765
NOT A ONE THE COMMITTEE THAT

02:48:28.832 --> 02:48:33.470
COMMITTEES MET AYE I THINK IT'S

02:48:33.536 --> 02:48:34.737
SENDING SIGNALS THAT.

02:48:34.804 --> 02:48:35.305
EVERYONE'S TAKING IS VERY

02:48:35.371 --> 02:48:36.306
SERIOUS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO

02:48:36.372 --> 02:48:36.873
WORKING WITH YOU ALL IN THE

02:48:36.940 --> 02:48:37.273
FUTURE THANK YOU.

02:48:37.340 --> 02:48:38.475
THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WANNA

02:48:38.541 --> 02:48:39.275
THANK OF THAT THAT WOULD THAT

02:48:39.342 --> 02:48:40.543
WOULD ACTUALLY VERY NICE CLOSING

02:48:40.610 --> 02:48:42.712
THANK YOU JOHN --

02:48:42.779 --> 02:48:43.947
I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH

02:48:44.013 --> 02:48:45.915
ALL OF YOU AS WELL I THINK --

02:48:45.982 --> 02:48:47.951
THIS BANKRUPTCY WHAT CAUGHT MY

02:48:48.017 --> 02:48:49.052
ATTENTION IN TERMS OF THIS

02:48:49.118 --> 02:48:50.420
BANKRUPTCY AND THAT THE

02:48:50.487 --> 02:48:51.955
TIMELINESS OF IT IN JUST A

02:48:52.021 --> 02:48:53.523
MOMENT WAS FILED.

02:48:53.590 --> 02:48:55.158
IS THAT IT SEEMS THAT FOR THE

02:48:55.225 --> 02:48:57.293
FIRST TIME EVER IN OUR STATE'S

02:48:57.360 --> 02:48:58.928
HISTORY WE HAVE A UTILITY --

02:48:58.995 --> 02:49:00.830
DECLARING BANKRUPTCY TO GET OUT

02:49:00.897 --> 02:49:02.465
OF AN OBLIGATION OF MAKING.

02:49:02.532 --> 02:49:03.433
VICTIMS HOLE AND THAT THAT WOULD

02:49:03.500 --> 02:49:06.970
BE ON PRESS AND IT WOULD.

02:49:07.036 --> 02:49:08.438
DEFINITELY.

02:49:08.505 --> 02:49:13.042
CREATE -- OF

02:49:13.109 --> 02:49:14.777
A NEW.

02:49:14.844 --> 02:49:16.079
WHICH TO THIS --

02:49:16.145 --> 02:49:17.247
IT WOULD IT WOULD A CREATE A

02:49:17.313 --> 02:49:19.048
PRECEDENT BUT I THINK IT'S VERY

02:49:19.115 --> 02:49:20.783
DANGEROUS FOR OUR STATE'S FUTURE.

02:49:20.850 --> 02:49:22.819
IF IN THE FUTURE OUR UTILITIES

02:49:22.886 --> 02:49:24.087
GOING TO BE USING BANKRUPTCY TO

02:49:24.153 --> 02:49:27.156
GET OUT OF MAKING VICTIMS --

02:49:27.223 --> 02:49:30.426
HOLE AND AND MY CONDOLENCES TO

02:49:30.493 --> 02:49:32.929
THE ENTIRE TOWN OF PARADISE THAT

02:49:32.996 --> 02:49:34.063
IS DEFINITELY BEEN COMPLETELY

02:49:34.130 --> 02:49:35.698
DESTROYED.

02:49:35.765 --> 02:49:38.067
FROM THIS AND AND WE SHOULDN'T

02:49:38.134 --> 02:49:40.737
AT ALL -- UP

02:49:40.803 --> 02:49:41.037
[inaudible]

02:49:41.104 --> 02:49:44.140
CONTINUE.

02:49:44.207 --> 02:49:46.476
TO SUSTAIN POLICIES THAT WILL DO

02:49:46.543 --> 02:49:47.510
THAT TO OTHER PARTS AND OTHER

02:49:47.577 --> 02:49:49.279
COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE.

02:49:49.345 --> 02:49:51.381
THAT WILL DEFINITELY JUST LEAD

02:49:51.447 --> 02:49:53.016
TO A GRADUAL DESTRUCTION OF OUR

02:49:53.082 --> 02:49:55.318
ENTIRE STATE WE DO HAVE TO FIX

02:49:55.385 --> 02:49:57.086
THIS I AGREE WITH YOU.

02:49:57.153 --> 02:50:00.423
AND THAT THAT SOLUTION IS IS.

02:50:00.490 --> 02:50:02.692
VERY TENUOUS I MEAN AND TERMS OF

02:50:02.759 --> 02:50:04.561
WILL WE MOVE THIS WRECK XIN WE

02:50:04.627 --> 02:50:06.229
AFFECTS INSURANCE WHIM OF THIS

02:50:06.296 --> 02:50:09.198
DIRECTION WE AFFECT --

02:50:09.265 --> 02:50:11.100
IN -- OF

02:50:11.167 --> 02:50:12.335
VESTER AS WE MOVE THIS TO THE

02:50:12.402 --> 02:50:13.736
DIRECTION WE WE AFFECT THE

02:50:13.803 --> 02:50:16.239
VICTIMS THERE'S VERY LITTLE ROOM

02:50:16.306 --> 02:50:17.574
FOR US TO MANEUVER.

02:50:17.640 --> 02:50:18.908
THROUGH THIS CORRECTIVE PROCESS

02:50:18.975 --> 02:50:21.044
BUT I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING

02:50:21.110 --> 02:50:21.678
THAT WE CAN DO WHATEVER WILL WE

02:50:21.744 --> 02:50:22.879
DO.

02:50:22.946 --> 02:50:25.481
HOPEFULLY WE'LL FOCUS ON ON ON

02:50:25.548 --> 02:50:26.349
MAKE IN --

02:50:26.416 --> 02:50:28.151
FUTURE VICTIMS HOLE THE CURRENT

02:50:28.217 --> 02:50:30.954
VICTIMS HOLE IN THIS PROCESS.

02:50:31.020 --> 02:50:32.689
AND AND A AT LEAST SOME

02:50:32.755 --> 02:50:34.324
ENCOURAGE THAT WE HAVE THE P. UC

02:50:34.390 --> 02:50:35.892
INVOLVED IN THIS WE HAVE THE

02:50:35.959 --> 02:50:37.093
LEGISLATURE HAS SOME ROLE IN

02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:38.628
THIS.

02:50:38.695 --> 02:50:40.930
IF NOT IS AS MUCH AS ANYONE ELSE

02:50:40.997 --> 02:50:42.031
TO BE TO BE FRANK WITH YOU WE

02:50:42.098 --> 02:50:42.699

STAKEHOLDERS.

02:50:44.634 --> 02:50:45.969
AND THAT HOPEFULLY CAN COULD

02:50:46.035 --> 02:50:49.038
WORK TOGETHER WE NEED TO WORK-TOGETHER TO THIS PROCESS AND

02:50:49.105 --> 02:50:50.573
THERE'S A LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION.

02:50:50.640 --> 02:50:52.909
WE'RE HERE AND WILLING TO TO DO

02:50:52.976 --> 02:50:54.444
THE HEAVY LIFTING IN WHATEVER WE

02:50:54.510 --> 02:50:56.813
DO PROBABLY WON'T BE.
