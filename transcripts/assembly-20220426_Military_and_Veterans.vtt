SITES OF SITES FOR THIS CEMETERY

01:09:17.453 --> 01:09:19.154
AND I WERE WONDERING I DID NOT

01:09:19.221 --> 01:09:20.823
SEEN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:21.857
I SHOULD HAVE TALKED TO THE

COMMITTEE STAFF BEFORE THIS

01:09:23.025 --> 01:09:25.027
HEARING HOW MUCH MONEY THE STATE

01:09:25.094 --> 01:09:28.163
HAS SPENT ON THOSE TWO STUDIES.

01:09:28.230 --> 01:09:29.732

01:09:29.798 --> 01:09:32.835
APPROXIMATELY 400-100-0500

01:09:32.902 --> 01:09:34.970
THOUSAND. BALLPARK TO HAVE

01:09:39.441 --> 01:09:41.210
LET'S JUST THOSE ARE BALLPARK

01:09:41.277 --> 01:09:43.379
NUMBERS THAT THE STATE HAS

01:09:43.445 --> 01:09:46.916
ALREADY SPENT ON STUDIES. AND

01:09:46.982 --> 01:09:49.485
I'M ALSO WONDERING IS. I KNOW

01:09:49.552 --> 01:09:53.222
THIS BILL PROPOSES TO STUDY.

01:09:53.289 --> 01:09:55.257
LIKELY THE GYPSUM CANYON SIDE

01:09:55.324 --> 01:09:57.726
ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT DESIGNATED BUT

01:09:57.793 --> 01:09:59.228
DO WE HAVE A BALLPARK ESTIMATE

01:09:59.295 --> 01:10:02.331
OF HOW MUCH THAT A CEMETERY AT

01:10:02.398 --> 01:10:06.201
THAT SITE WILL COST. HENCE THE

01:10:06.268 --> 01:10:08.537
NEED FOR A STUDY BUT THERE'S NO

01:10:08.604 --> 01:10:09.605
BALLPARK ESTIMATE THERE'S NO

01:10:09.672 --> 01:10:12.508
OKAY. I KNOW THE COUNTY HAS

01:10:12.575 --> 01:10:14.577
COMMITTED FUNDING. FOR THE

01:10:14.643 --> 01:10:16.579
POTENTIAL CEMETERY AT THAT SITE

01:10:16.645 --> 01:10:19.048
SO I JUST WANT TO FLEISCH THOSE

01:10:19.114 --> 01:10:22.484
POINTS OUT. AND- IF WE CAN'T

01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:24.119

VICE CHAIR VOEPEL. YES AS A

VETERAN- I'M LOOKING AT THE

01:10:47.776 --> 01:10:50.579
VALLEY HERE. INTER'S QUITE A

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:55.184
FEW- INDIVIDUAL HOUSES. AND THE

01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:57.653
POSE VETERANS CEMETERY WOULD BE

01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.388
MORE UP THE HILLSIDE. WITH A

01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:02.224
LINE OF SIGHT NOW THERE IS A

01:11:02.291 --> 01:11:03.959
BIAS AGAINST CEMETERIES IN

01:11:04.026 --> 01:11:05.594
GENERAL PEOPLE ARE KIND OF

01:11:05.661 --> 01:11:09.264
AFRAID OF THEM- I GREW UP.

01:11:09.331 --> 01:11:11.400
NEAREST CEMETERY AND MY FATHER

01:11:11.467 --> 01:11:13.202
ALWAYS TOLD ME THE SAFEST PLACE

01:11:13.268 --> 01:11:15.537
ON THE PLANET IS IN A CEMETERY

01:11:15.604 --> 01:11:18.073
NO ONE'S GOING TO MESS WITH YOU

01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:20.376
- SO. I AM CONCERNED IT MAY BE A

01:11:20.442 --> 01:11:23.045
LITTLE BIT OF PUSH BACK HERE IS

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:24.780
JUST SIMPLY. HAVING A CEMETERY

01:11:24.847 --> 01:11:26.415
IN THE SIGHTLINE ON DO

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:28.217
TOMBSTONES SO IT COULD BE AS

01:11:28.283 --> 01:11:30.719
SIMPLE AS THAT THE OTHER THING

01:11:30.786 --> 01:11:33.222
IS TRAFFIC. IN MY EXPERIENCE

01:11:33.288 --> 01:11:35.257
WITH VETERANS CEMETERIES THE

01:11:35.324 --> 01:11:36.925
MAIN TRAFFIC WOULD BE ON

01:11:36.992 --> 01:11:39.662
MEMORIAL DAY. AND WHAT'S

01:11:39.728 --> 01:11:41.997
INTERESTING IS EVERYBODY'S OFF

01:11:42.064 --> 01:11:43.832
ON MEMORIAL DAY SO YOU DON'T

01:11:43.899 --> 01:11:46.735
HAVE BIG TRAFFIC ISSUES BECAUSE

01:11:46.802 --> 01:11:50.205
IT'S A HOLIDAY. IN MAINLY THE

01:11:50.272 --> 01:11:52.007
PEOPLE THAT GO TO A VETERANS

01:11:52.074 --> 01:11:54.476
CEMETERY ON MEMORIAL DAY OR

01:11:54.543 --> 01:11:57.479
VETERANS FAMILIES. SO THE

01:11:57.546 --> 01:11:59.648
TRAFFIC ISSUE IS REALLY A NON

01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:01.250
STARTER ARE YOU ALSO HAVE A

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:03.152
LITTLE BIT MORE TRAFFIC AT

01:12:03.218 --> 01:12:05.454
CHRISTMAS. BECAUSE A LOT OF

01:12:05.521 --> 01:12:06.889
VETERANS FAMILIES WILL PUT A

01:12:06.955 --> 01:12:08.791
CHRISTMAS TREE ON A GRAVE. OR

01:12:08.857 --> 01:12:12.061
REEF AND ENFORCE JULY OF COURSE.

01:12:12.127 --> 01:12:15.964
SO I AM NOT CONVINCED AT ALL

01:12:16.031 --> 01:12:17.666
THAT THERE'S A TRAFFIC PROBLEM.

01:12:17.733 --> 01:12:19.268
IT WITHOUT GETTING TOO LONG

01:12:19.334 --> 01:12:21.837
WINDED I ALWAYS REMIND PEOPLE.

01:12:21.904 --> 01:12:26.308
ABOUT VETERANS WE CELEBRATE

01:12:26.375 --> 01:12:29.845

QUESTIONS ON THE STUDIES AND YES

01:13:03.712 --> 01:13:05.481
THAT HAS BEEN- A LITTLE TRICKY

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:08.884
AT- THERE WERE. THREE SITES

01:13:08.951 --> 01:13:10.819
PROPOSED IN IRVINE ONE WAS NOT

01:13:10.886 --> 01:13:13.155
STUDIED THE STRAWBERRY SITE BUT

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:15.758
THE GULF SITE AND ARDA- I

01:13:15.824 --> 01:13:19.728
BELIEVE EACH OF THEM WERE. ABOUT

01:13:19.795 --> 01:13:21.029
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND SO TO A

01:13:21.096 --> 01:13:23.031
MILLION AND FOR BOTH OF THOSE

01:13:23.098 --> 01:13:28.003
THIS NEXT ONE- GIPSON CANYON. WE

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:30.739
HAVE PUT UP TO SEVEN HUNDRED

01:13:30.806 --> 01:13:32.574
THOUSAND IN THERE- I HAVE HEARD

01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:34.176
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WHAT IS

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:36.979
THE COUNTIES- INVESTMENT IN THIS

01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:38.747
AS FAR AS PUTTING UP MONEY AND

01:13:38.814 --> 01:13:40.682
NATIONALLY FOR THAT VERSUS CAL

01:13:40.749 --> 01:13:43.919
THAT. ONE OF THE REASONS- THAT

01:13:43.986 --> 01:13:46.789
WE WERE WORKING WITH CALVET TO

01:13:46.855 --> 01:13:48.757
DO THIS STUDY IS THE URGENCY

01:13:48.824 --> 01:13:50.159
PART OF IT OTHERWISE WE'D HAVE

01:13:50.225 --> 01:13:52.094
TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AND

01:13:52.161 --> 01:13:53.662
START OVER ON SOME OF THIS. BUT

01:13:53.729 --> 01:13:55.931
THE CAMERA COUNTY IS PUTTING IN

01:13:55.998 --> 01:13:57.666
TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN

01:13:57.733 --> 01:13:59.134
ADDITION TO THE TWENTY THREE

01:13:59.201 --> 01:14:01.436
POINT FOUR MILLION THAT NOT ONLY

01:14:01.503 --> 01:14:03.539
MYSELF BUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER DALY

01:14:03.605 --> 01:14:06.675
AND SENATOR TOM- BURKE- HAVE

01:14:06.742 --> 01:14:09.077
WERE ABLE TO SECURE WHICH ADDS.

01:14:09.144 --> 01:14:11.914
IS THAT TWENTY THREE POINT FOUR

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:14.383
MILLION SO AND ASK TO HAVE THE

01:14:14.449 --> 01:14:17.286
TWENTY MILLION ACCOUNT PLUS THE

01:14:17.352 --> 01:14:20.389
ADDITIONAL. MONEY THAT IS THERE-

01:14:20.455 --> 01:14:22.457
THAT DOES NOT MEAN WE WANT TO

01:14:22.524 --> 01:14:25.027
JUST A ROAD MONEY JUST TO STUDY

01:14:25.093 --> 01:14:27.863
ANY SITE BUT THIS IS A TWO

01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:29.731
HUNDRED ACRE SITE- THEY'RE

01:14:29.798 --> 01:14:32.334
HAVING QUESTIONS WOULD- THIS

01:14:32.401 --> 01:14:34.736
VETERANS CEMETERY BE COMBINED

01:14:34.803 --> 01:14:36.638
WITH THE PUBLIC CEMETERY. THEY

01:14:36.705 --> 01:14:38.373
WILL NOT BE COMBINED THERE WILL

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:41.143
BE A SUB PUBLIC CEMETERY- IN A

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:43.412
DIFFERENT PART OF THIS- PARCEL

01:14:43.478 --> 01:14:45.981
OF LAND WITH ITS OWN OPERATING

01:14:46.048 --> 01:14:49.084
NOT FROM CAL THAT FROM THE WATCH

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:50.953
COUNTY CEMETERY DISTRICT. THE

01:14:51.019 --> 01:14:52.788
ORANGE COUNTY CEMETERY DISTRICT

01:14:52.855 --> 01:14:54.389
WILL BE PUTTING IN QUITE A BIT

01:14:54.456 --> 01:14:56.458
OF INFRASTRUCTURE AS FOR AS A

01:14:56.525 --> 01:15:00.062
ROADS AND OTHER- INVESTMENTS TO

01:15:00.128 --> 01:15:02.865
GET THIS PROPERTY. YEAH I WOULD

01:15:02.931 --> 01:15:04.466
SAY AS FAR AS SOME OF THE

01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:07.603
OPPOSITION- THIS PARCEL SITS

01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:10.505
KIND OF ON A HILLSIDE IN ANAHEIM

01:15:10.572 --> 01:15:12.808
HILLS AND THERE IS A FREE WAY

01:15:12.875 --> 01:15:15.077
THAT. DOESN'T GO THROUGH THE

01:15:15.143 --> 01:15:17.913
PROPERTY BUT THAT RUNS- OUR

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:20.449
PARALLEL TO THIS PROPERTY SO

01:15:20.515 --> 01:15:22.417
THERE ARE NO HOMES DIRECTLY IN

01:15:22.484 --> 01:15:23.886
THE VICINITY THERE ACTUALLY

01:15:23.952 --> 01:15:26.355
ACROSS. THE FREEWAY WHICH IS

01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:28.323
SEVERAL LANES QUITE A BIT

01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:30.759
DISTANCE AWAY AND THEN LASTLY

01:15:30.826 --> 01:15:33.629
SOME MYTHS ABOUT THAT THEY WOULD

01:15:33.695 --> 01:15:36.865
ACTUALLY BE- HAVING A CREMATORY

01:15:36.932 --> 01:15:39.167
THERETHAT IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE

01:15:39.234 --> 01:15:40.569
THAT WOULD THAT WOULD NEVER BE

01:15:40.636 --> 01:15:43.171
ON SITE SO I JUST WANT. TO THE

01:15:43.238 --> 01:15:44.273
PEOPLE KNOW THAT THIS IS A
