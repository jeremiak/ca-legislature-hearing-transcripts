MARKET IN LA -- FINANCE WHICH WAS WROTE APARTMENT FINANCE OKAY THANK YOU SO WE'RE GONNA GO pAHEAD BEGIN THE OVERVIEW WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT RIGHT UP TO BUY -- STAFF SO WE CAN SORT OF HIT THE HIGH POINTS OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE DEPARTMENT AND ALSO. WHAT YOU SEE COMING IN THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR AND I THINK WE DID HAVE -- AND WHEN THE DISH NO QUESTION THAT YOU CAN TRY TO ADDRESS AS WELL MORE SPECIFIC QUESTION THANK YOU. THANK YOUR THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE YOUR VIEW AND AND I'LL BE BRIEF ON THIS AND YOU HAVE A COMPRESS CASUAL. SO US IS -- TO IS THE AGENDA GIVES YOU THAT GOOD OVERVIEW OF OUR DEPARTMENT IN OUR PROGRAMS AND SERVICES YOU BEST THIS IS SPEAK TO THROUGH QUESTIONS ALL STAR WITH. MORE ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE CHALLENGES AND THEN THE STRATEGIES TO CONTINUE SERVING ADULTS. SO. IN TERMS OF OUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS TEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS TODAY FOR ON THE PATH OUT OF POVERTY COME THROUGH EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE OF THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE I THINK IT'S A HALLMARK. OF THE WORK THAT WE DO. AS WELL AS THE WORK THAT WE DO THROUGH OUR INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES -- FIFTY ONE INDIVIDUALS ARE NO LONGER INSTITUTIONALIZED BECAUSE THEY HAVE TRANSITIONED INTO COMMUNITY LIVING IN THERE ARE THIRTY TWO INDIVIDUALS OVER THE AGE OF ONE HUNDRED OR BLIND. WHO CONTINUE TO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE OF THE SERVICES OF PROVIDE AND JUST A SAMPLE OF THE WORK THAT WE DO? ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE OFFER A PRODUCT THAT WE'RE DOING. ISRAEL YOU ESTABLISHING A SYSTEMS ALIGNMENT THAT ENSURES THAT THE SERVICES THAT WE'RE PROVIDING OR SEAMLESS TO THAT INDIVIDUAL ENSURING THAT THAT ALIGNMENT IS EFFECTIVE WE APPLY THE PRINCIPLES OF PERSON CENTERED IN PERSON DRIVEN. WHICH ALLOWS US TO INDIVIDUALIZE THE SERVICES TO EACH CONSUMER NO MATTER WHETHER THEY'RE INDEPENDENT LIVING OR IN A VOCATIONAL BILL THE TATIAN. AND OF COURSE THE WHOLE PERSON CARE WHICH ALLOWS US TO ADDRESS -- MORE HOLISTICALLY WHAT THAT INDIVIDUAL NEEDS TO EITHER. BE EMPLOYED OR TO CONTINUE TO BE INDEPENDENT AND THEN UNIVERSAL DESIGN WHICH CONTINUES TO ADVANCE -- ACCESSIBILITY AND USABILITY IN ALL SYSTEMS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. WE OF COURSE CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT OF THE WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT. WE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE OUR SERVICES TO YOU WHO WERE STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THOSE SERVICES ARE AIMED TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE MAXIMALLY PREPARED. TO BEGIN THE JOURNEY INTO THE WORKPLACE. AND PART OF THAT -- IS TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE. SERVICES SO THAT THEY KNOW WHAT TO POST SECONDARY OPTIONS OR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION SAID CETERA. WE ALSO THEN OF COURSE CONTINUE THE WORK -- TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE -- INSULTED WORKSHOPS ARE RECEIVING THE COUNSELING. IN THE GUIDANCE IS THAT ALLOWS THEM TO TRANSITION FROM THOSE -- INTO COMPETITIVE IN A GREAT EMPLOYMENT. THE OTHER PART TO WE'RE WORKING ON IS MODERNIZING OUR REHABILITATION EMPLOYMENT SERVICES SO THAT WE ARE. GOAL OF ENSURING. THAT WERE MEETING THE COMMUNITY OR THE TALENT NEEDS OF THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE DOING THE HIRING AS WELL IS MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE READY TO HIRE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. ON OUR PROMISE SIDE BOB WAS VERY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT WE ARE KNOWN YOUR SIX OF THAT GRANT WITH WRAPPING THAT UP BUT THAT GRANT HAS BEEN INVALUABLE TO INFORM OUR STUDENTS SERVICES. AS WELL AS THE HIGHLIGHT NEED TO SIZE THE CULTURE AND SYSTEMS ALIGNMENT THAT WE NEED TO BETTER SERVE THE YOUTH IN THE FAMILY. THE COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED BLUEPRINT -- CONTINUES WARRANT IN YOUR TO OF THAT IMPLEMENTATION WE'RE MAKING GREAT PROCESS PROGRESS WITHOUT WORKING WITH. OUR PARTNERS A DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AS WELL AS A SPECIAL EDUCATION -- AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF ACTIONS THAT WE'VE TAKEN THERE TO CONTINUE. TO ADVANCE THAT INITIATIVE. THE OTHER THING THAT I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU IS THE WHAT WE DO WITH OUR INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES IN THEIR WE CONTINUE TO ADVANCE YOU ALMOST A DECISION SO PEOPLE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY -- WITH DIGNITY AND PURPOSE -- FREEDOM OF CHOICE. WE ARE ENSURING THAT THEY'RE CONNECTED TO HEALTHCARE SOLD -- THEIR HEALTHCARE IS RESTORED AND AVAILABLE TO CONTINUE TO BE INDEPENDENT ENSURING HOW. INFLUENCE THE HOW HEALTH CARE LOOKS AT THAT INDIVIDUAL SO THEY CAN MEET THEIR NEEDS AS INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. AND IN A DENTAL FINE SYSTEMS -- AND HELPING EDUCATE PROVIDE ASSISTANCE THOSE SYSTEMS TO BE MORE INCLUSIVE OF THEIR SERVICES. AS AN EXAMPLE OF SOME OF THE ALIGNMENT THE AGING AND DISABILITY RESOURCE CENTERS -- STAND OUT AS A IN ONE WAY OR INDEPENDENT LIVING -- YES PARTNERING COLLABORATING WITH OTHER SYSTEMS. SO YOU ASKED US TO BRIEFLY SPEAK TO THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. I'M GETTING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES EMPLOYED WHILE WE COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD OF THE FACT THAT WE TRULY FOCUS ON LEAVING NO ONE BEHIND. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT WE RECOGNIZE THAT TODAY WE'RE SERVING INDIVIDUALS WITH MOST SIGNIFICANT DISABILITIES AND IN MANY CASES MULTIPLE DISABILITIES COULD BE SENSORY LOSS DEVELOPMENTAL -- ANY NUMBER OF COMBINATIONS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON IS THAT FOR STALLING THAT INDIVIDUALS READINESS FOR EMPLOYMENT. IT'S REALLY HAVEN'T LIVED A LIFE OF LITTLE OR NO EXPECTATION THAT EMPLOYMENT WOULD BE A REALITY. AND SO WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL SYSTEMS AND ALL PARTNERS TO CHANGE THAT. WHY THAT'S AN ISSUE IS BECAUSE OFTEN? WHEN THAT INDIVIDUAL COMES TO US FOR SERVICES IT'S THE? IT'S NOT THE FIRST BUT IT'S VERY CLOSE TO THE FIRST TIME THAT THE REALLY ENGAGING IN THAT CONVERSATION THAT SAYS WORK AS POSSIBLE AND THEN OF COURSE THAT SKILL DEVELOPMENT IS THEN BEGINNING. THERE WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT TOO LATE FOR US SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THAT. THE OTHER THING THAT'S WHICH WILL CONTAIN ONLY CHALLENGED WITH IS THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES OFTEN DON'T START AT THE SAME PLACES THEIR NON DISABLED COUNTERPARTS. IN THE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO THEM CERTAINLY ARE THE SAME SO THEIR PATH AND THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT IT TAKES A TRAVEL THAT PATH CAN BE DIFFERENT SO PART OF WHAT WE DO. IS THAT WHOLE SYSTEMS ALIGNMENT THAT WILL HELP -- TO CHANGE SOME OF THOSE REALITIES. SO FOR SOME CONTEXT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WITH PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES CONTINUES TO PERSISTENTLY BE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF 70%. BUSINESS IS BEING OPEN TO AND HIRING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES -- IS ANOTHER AREA THAT WE CONTINUE TO BE CHALLENGED AND PART OF THAT -- IS RECOGNIZING THAT A BUSINESS REALLY IS ANYONE THAT MAKES A HIGHER WHETHER IT BE A GOVERNMENT FOR PROFIT FOR PROFIT NONPROFIT DOESN'T MATTER IT'S ANYBODY THAT REALLY MAKES A HIGHER. SO ADDRESSING. FROM THEIR FEARS AND CONCERNS IS PARAMOUNT -- AND WHAT SOME OF THOSE FEARS AND CONCERNS CAN BE -- YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE RISK HOW AM I GOING TO ACCOMMODATE WHAT IF YOU KNOW ANY NUMBER OF TYPES OF THINGS LIKE THAT MEDIC IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WHILE TO DATE. WE SEE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND SOCIETY MUCH MORE THAN EVER BEFORE ENTERTAINMENT IT CETERA. WE STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GO WHERE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE SEEN AS HAVING THE SAME TALENT IN THE SAME POTENTIAL AND GIVEN THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES SO -- IN TERMS OF A CHALLENGE THAT'S AN AREA THAT WE FACE SYSTEMS ALIGNMENT AS I MENTIONED WE'RE WORKING ON IT. IT STILL HAS IN THE CHI. WELL -- YOU KNOW THE THE WHAT IT NEEDS TO BE IN ORDER TO HAVE THE EFFECTIVE THAT IT NEEDS TO HAVE SO. AREAS THAT WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THEM. AND THEN FINALLY YOU **** TO ADDRESS ONE OF THE STRATEGIES TO CONTINUE TO GET INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES AND EMPLOYMENT GIVEN OUR SHIFT TO SERVING STUDENTS -- OUR MISSION BASED REVIEW -- REALLY JUST FIRST OF ALL THANK OUR COLLEAGUES AT FINANCE FOR THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE COLLECTIVELY THEY ARE -- IT REALLY FOCUSED ON OUR CORE MISSION AND THE AND THE WORK THAT WE DO TO DRIVE THAT MISSION. AND THEN TODAY'S -- BUDGET ITEMS CERTAINLY OUR REFLECTION OF THAT -- WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE MORE THAT WE CAN GET THEM READY FOR EMPLOYMENT THEY WHEN THEY HIT ADULTHOOD. THE BE LESS OF THE DEMAND ON THE ADULT SYSTEM FOR THEM TO GET A WORK. AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A LONGSTANDING. COLLABORATION PARTNERSHIP OF SPECIAL EDUCATION. SO WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE THAT -- IN SUPPORT OF GETTING THE KIDS READY FOR EMPLOYMENT. WE ARE USING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MODELS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WITH A LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES TO DO THAT WITHIN OUR ADULT SERVICES SPECIFICALLY -- WE'RE LEANING HEAVILY ON SYSTEMS ALIGNMENT SO THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE THAT WORKPLACES SUPPORTS AND WORK READINESS SUPPORTS THAT EXIST IN THE OTHER SYSTEMS. AND THEN BE ABLE -- TO DO THEY ARE WE ARE REALLY LOOKING AT OUR FIELD -- STRUCTURE TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE BETTER POSITION TO ALIGN WITH THE SYSTEMS PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT FLOW OF THE LOCAL LEVEL SUCH AS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SPECIAL EDUCATION AND WHAT HAVE YOU. AND THEN I MENTIONED BUSINESS ENGAGEMENT MORE PRADA THE FACT THAT WE'RE WORKING ON THAT. BUT WE REALLY NEED TO CONTINUE TO SHAPE -- THOSE ATTITUDES THAT EXIST OUT THERE AND SO PART OF WHAT WE DO IS WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND EDUCATION. TO THE BUSINESS PARTNERS AND AND TO HELP THEM TO HAVE A WORKPLACE THAT IS A DOMINATING IN WELCOMING FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES SO. STOP THEIR TAKING THE QUESTIONS YOU HAVE OR WE CAN PROCEED WITH OUR OTHER GENDER. OKAY. ALL RIGHT -- COMMENTS FROM LA -- FINANCE QUESTION MANY MEMBERS -- I DID HAVE. ONE I DO HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING -- IN. TERMS OF THE REVIEW -- THE THE I GUESS IT'S CALLED SEE A PROMISE GRANT. BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT ONLY GOES THROUGH SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH OF THIS YEAR -- IS IS THAT ENDING THEN OR WHAT'S WHAT'S THE FUTURE OF THAT -- SO THIS GRANT IN ITS FIFTH YEAR AND IT'S GONNA CONCLUDED THE AND THIS COMING YEAR. IS THAT WHAT WHAT'S THE FUTURE OF THAT PROGRAM AS A GUN JUST ENDERS AT IS THERE ARE SOME PLAN FOR THE FUTURE AND SEE IF BUDGET ITEM SOMETHING RELATE TO THAT SO. SO SO PROMISE CONTINUES NOT IN THE IN THE SAME CONTEXT TO IT WITH THE SAME FRAME THAT IT THAT IT EXISTED WHICH REALLY WAS A STUDY. TO IDENTIFY THE INTERVENTIONS THAT WOULD BE SUPPORT OF OF REDUCING THE RELIANCE ON KIDS. WHO IN THIS CASE WERE ON SOCIAL SECURITY SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME? SO WHERE THAT CONTINUES AREAS OF THAT THE LESSONS LEARNED THE INTERVENTIONS BARBIE AND BLENDED INTO OUR CONTINUED WORK WHAT PROVIDING SERVICES TO STUDENTS. ONE THING OF NOTE HERE IS THAT ONE PROMISE WAS ISSUED. SHORTLY AFTER THAT IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN THE WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT WHICH WE AUTHORIZED WE HAVE BACKED CAME OUT AND THAT'S WHERE IT MANDATED. TO SERVICES TO STUDENTS SO IT DOES THE SERVICES TO THE STUDENTS TO DO CNTINUE. IT'S NO LONGER CONTINUING AS A STUDY WITH THE RIVERS OF THE STUDY VERY MUCH HAS INFORMED AND WILL CONTINUE TO INFORM HOW WE SERVE THE YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES [inaudible] SO BASICALLY. IN SOME WAYS THIS PROGRAM WHICH SHE SAID WAS A STUDY IS REALLY BEING FOLDED INTO THE WORKFORCE INNOVATION OPPORTUNITY ACTIVITIES CRISIS CORRECT ALL RIGHT. OKAY. THAT'S HELPFUL TO KNOW ALL RIGHT -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OKAY SO -- THANK YOU SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO WHICH IS THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL FOR MISSION BASED REVIEW VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION TBI PROGRAMS. I CAN GO AHEAD AND START ITEM TO A IS IN REGARDS TO KERR OUR COMMUNITY REHABILITATION. RIGHT SO AS JOE MENTIONED -- WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT'S BEEN COLLABORATIVE IN NATURE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS ON THE MISSION BASED REVIEW. AND ONE OF THE PRIMARY IN CRITICAL AGENDA ITEMS THAT CAME OUT OF THAT WAS THE NEED TO INCREASE RATES FOR COMMUNITY RE HAVE PARTNERS WHO PARTNER WITH US ON A DAILY BASIS TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO OUR CONSUMERS. THE BUDGET PROPOSAL INCLUDES TO SPECIFIC ITEMS FIRST THERE IS AN ACROSS THE BOARD 10% RATE INCREASE FOR SERVICES PROVIDED BY OUR COMMUNITY REHAB PROGRAMS WITH SOME EXPECTED EXCEPTIONS THAT ALL EXPLAIN IN A FEW MOMENTS. SECONDLY FOR THOSE SERVICES THAT INCLUDE A CONSUMER MINIMUM WAGE COMPONENTS SPECIFICALLY SITUATIONAL ASSESSMENT. AND WORK ADJUSTMENT THERE WILL ALSO BE A RATE ADJUSTMENT THERE TO ACCOMMODATE THAT. THE SERVICES THAT WILL RECEIVE A VOCATIONAL ASSESSMENTS PERSONAL VOCATIONAL SOCIAL ADJUSTMENT. EMPLOYMENT SERVICES LEAD SERVICES THAT WERE FIRM FORMALLY KNOWN AS COMMUNICATION AND LANGUAGE SKILLS TRAINING FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH HEARING IMPAIRMENTS. INDEPENDENT LIVING SKILLS TRAINING ORIENTATION MOBILITY A MERCHANT SERVICES REHAB TECHNOLOGY WHICH INCLUDES ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY EVALUATION AND TRAINING SERVICES. SITUATIONAL ASSESSMENT AND WORK IT JUST MEANT. THE LAST TWO SERVICES THAT I MENTION SITUATIONAL ASSESSMENT AND WORKING JUST MEANT HAVE A CONSUMER MINIMUM WAGE COMPONENT TO THAT. WHICH MEANS THAT A CONSUMER PARTICIPATES IN THE SERVICE AND IS PAID FOR THEIR TIME IN THE WORK THAT THEY ARE DOING WHILE THEY ARE UNDER SERVICE. OUR COMMUNITY REHABILITATION PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN PROVIDING FOR THE INCREASE IN MINIMUM WAGE FOR THE CONSUMERS INVOLVED WITHOUT HAVING A RATE CHANGE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE SO THIS PROPOSAL SECONDLY -- PROPOSES TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THAT INCREASING BY FOUR DOLLARS AN HOUR TO COMPENSATE FOR THE INCREASE THE MINIMUM WAGE THAT OCCURRED IT IS UP TO TWELVE DOLLARS AN HOUR AT THIS TIME THE PROPOSED. BUDGET DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY RATE ADJUSTMENTS FOR SEVERAL SERVICES FIRST OF ALL SENATE SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETING AND THEN SECONDLY NON SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT JOB COACHING SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT SERVICES ALSO KNOWN AS JOB COACHING SERVICES. THE INTERPRETING RATES ARE NOT PROPOSED TO HAVE A RATE INCREASE BECAUSE THEY WERE LAST UPGRADED IN APRIL OF TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN TO ENSURE. THE AVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS WHO REQUIRED IT AND WE WERE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES WITHOUT INCREASING THAT RATE. SECONDLY AS IT RELATES TO SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT INCLUDING JOB COACHING AND NON SUPPORTED A JOB COACHING SERVICES. THESE WERE PREVIOUSLY INCREASED BY THE DEPARTMENT IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN TO BE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE RATE INCREASES FOR THE SAME SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT SERVICES IMPLANTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. THIS WAS CONDUCTED THROUGH AB TWO X. TWO DASH. ONE THE SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT RATES MOST RECENTLY INCREASE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN ARE HOUSED IN THE WELL FOR AN INSTITUTION'S CODE AND WOULD NEED TO BE DONE JOINTLY IF THEY WERE GOING TO BE DONE BUT THEY HAVE RECEIVED AN INCREASE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND IN. SIXTEEN FOR AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN ARE WE HAVE SPECIALISTS ARE COMMUNICATING AND ENGAGING WITH OUR COMMUNITY RE HAVE PARTNER STATEWIDE AND HAVE BEEN ANSWERING QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS REGARDING THIS PROPOSAL. AND ADDITIONALLY IN PREPARATION FOR THE SHIFT WE ARE PROPOSING A pHAVE PARTNERS IN THE FIRST WEEK OF JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN UPON BUDGET APPROVAL THE PROPOSED DATE -- RATE INCREASE WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN OUR CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND WE'LL GO TO EFFECT IMMEDIATELY ON JULY [inaudible] ONE THANK YOU. YOU HAD ASKED US -- TO SPEAK TO A COUPLE OF ITEMS THE FIRST ITEM IS IN REGARDS -- TO WHY WE PROPOSE A RATE INCREASE OF 10% -- INSTEAD OF USING A DIFFERENT METHODOLOGY WITH WHICH WAS A COST DEVELOPMENT PURPOSE AND HOW WE LANDED ON THE 10% AND I'M GOING TO TURN TO MY PARTNER HERE AT FINANCE FIRST. THANK YOU. YES -- ARE ALL JUST RESPOND TO THE FIRST TWO QUESTIONS ON THE AGENDA. WE BELIEVE THIS IS REASON APPROACH TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE THAT WE COLLECTIVELY IDENTIFIED AS PART OF THE MISSION BASED REVIEW PROCESS. THIS SERVES IN AN AS AN INVESTMENT IN THE VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION PROGRAM TO MAINTAIN THE CRP PROVIDER POOL AND CURRENT SERVICE LEVELS TO BE OUR CONSUMERS. IT ALSO BOUNCES THE NEED FOR LONG TERM FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY. AND PRUDENCE AN ONGOING SPENDING COMMITMENTS WHICH IS THE THEME OF THIS GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND 10% IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENT GIVEN THE RATES OF NOT INCREASES. TWO THOUSAND NINE AS SUCH WE ARE COMMITTED TO MONITORING THE EFFECTS OF THIS INCREASE ON THE NUMBER OF CRP PROVIDERS. AND WILL DETERMINE IF ADDITIONAL INCREASES NEED TO BE MADE WE'LL ALSO ANALYZE IF THERE ARE ANY REGIONAL WHICH GRAPHIC VARIATION SINCERE P. PROVIDER NUMBERS DUE TO VARIATIONS IN COST OF LIVING OR OTHER SERVICE A PROVISION COSTS. AND THEN THE FOURTH QUESTION THE FOURTH QUESTION WAS IN REGARDS TO SOCIAL SECURITY REIMBURSEMENTS -- AND YOU YOU STATED AS FOLLOWS AS SOCIAL SECURITY REIMBURSEMENTS ARE NOT A STABLE FUNDING SOURCE. HOW WILL THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION PLAN POSSIBLE FUTURE -- REVENUE FLUCTUATIONS. ULTIMATELY THE DEPARTMENT RE HAVE MONTAGES OUR SOCIAL SECURITY REIMBURSEMENT DOLLARS IN IN A SPECIFIC PRIORITY ORDER -- FIRST OF ALL THERE WILL BE SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION FUNDING FOR THE INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS THREE POINT THREE MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH OUR WORK INCENTIVE PLANNERS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF REHAB WHO ASSIST INDIVIDUALS. OR SS I AND SSD I BENEFICIARIES RECEIVE SERVICES TO BECOME EMPLOYED WHICH RESULTS IN REIMBURSEMENTS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION. THIS THREE POINT FOUR MILLION FOR COMMUNITY REHAB PROGRAM RATES AND THEN ONE POINT SIX FOR THE IT INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL. OUR REVENUE OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS HAS MORE THAN PAID FOR THE SERVICES AT OUR REVENUE CURRENTLY FOR CURRENT FISCAL YEAR UP THROUGH MARCH IS THAT IT SEVENTEEN POINT SIX MILLION. SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO LIVE WITHIN OUR BUDGET WE WILL MONITORING CONTINUE TO LIVE WITHIN OUR BUDGET. BUT WE PLAN TO UTILISE THIS MONEY EFFECTIVELY CONSISTENT WITH THE LAW [inaudible] OKAY. NOW COMES FROM ALEJO. SONYA PECK ELIO. WE WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT -- THE THE MINIMUM WAGE COMPONENT OF THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO US AND WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE RATES HAVE NOT BEEN. A INCREASED OTHERWISE FOR QUITE SOME TIME -- AS HAS ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED THE 10% DOESN'T HAVE A PARTICULARLY ANALYTIC BASIS AT THIS POINT WE WE RECOGNIZE -- THE DEPARTMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAVE INDICATED THAT IT'S A FIRST STEP YEAH -- TO PROVIDE SOME FISCAL RELIEF -- TO THESE -- COMMUNITY PROVIDERS -- AND WE'RE PLEASED TO HEAR THAT THEY'LL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE EFFECT OF THAT INCREASE ON SAY THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS BUT WE JUST ENCOURAGE. THE YOU KNOW TO CONTINUING TO LOOK AT THOSE TYPES OF METRICS TO HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF HOW MUCH. OF RATE INCREASES IN THE FUTURE NEED TO BE. ANY FURTHER COMMENTS FROM THE FINANCE ON THIS OKAY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SO I GUESS FROM. THE MONITORING AND SO FORTH AND I APPRECIATE THE FUNDING FOR AN INCREASE I THINK -- YELL YES [inaudible] WELL. IN TERMS OF BECAUSE I THINK PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND AND NINE BASICALLY THERE WAS A THEY LOOKED AT THE COST RIGHT SERVICES RIGHT. AND THEN THERE ON RECESSION HIT WE SORT OF FLATTENED EVERYBODY SO THE PROCESS SO I MEAN I GUESS-OF THE GOOD AND THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO THE COSTS WERE LASSEN THEY GOT MOVED UP TO AN AVERAGE AND THEN OTHER PEOPLE GOT MOVED TO REGULAR AND THEN. DOWN RIGHT. AND SO WERE STILL PRESERVING THAT STRUCTURE IN MANY WAYS AND I DON'T KNOW I MEAN IT IS SO ARE WE AND I PRETTY SAID YOU'RE MONITORING I MEAN. THIS IS BEEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE I GUESS I'M. D. E. ARE NOT CONCERNED ABOUT I MEAN THE PEOPLE WHO PREVIOUSLY E. L. WHO TOOK THIS ACTUALLY MORE OF A CUT I MEAN A DAISY. WE WERE NOT SEEN DISPROPORTIONAL CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF THEM BILL PROVIDE THE SERVICES - EVEN NOW I MEAN THIS IS THIS IS NOW TEN YEARS LATER SO IT'S SO WE CAN SAVE MONEY TO FUTURE BUT IN TERMS OF WE'RE DOING A 10% ACROSS THE BOARD THAT'S GREAT -- BUT I MEAN RIGHT NOW SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT SINCE WE DID TWO THOUSAND NINE WE'RE NOT TOO CONCERNED THAT WE FLATTEN IT OUT THE DOES ANY. SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECT. YEAH SALAMI START THAT OCCURRED SENATOR SO -- AIDID. GOOD OBSERVATIONS -- APPRECIATE THOSE I THINK ONE THING THAT'S WHICH CERTAINLY -- TRY TO KEEP IN MIND AS WE KEEP LOOKING AT ALL THIS IS. WE OFFICER THE THE ISSUE BETWEEN URBAN AND RURAL. AMWAY FOR IN THE URBAN SETTING YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE DENSITY -- WE HAVE THE DIFFICULTY OF TRAVEL WHATEVER BUT WE ALSO HAVE THE AVAILABILITY OF A WIDER RANGE OF SERVICES IF YOU'RE IN A RURAL SETTING. YOU DON'T HAVE THE DENSITY BUT TO CONSUMERS ARE SO MUCH FOR THEIR SPREAD APART TO SUCH AS A REDUCED. LEVEL OF RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE SO. I THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF VARIABLES THAT YOU KNOW AS WE LOOK AT THIS ACROSS THE STATE -- IN TERMS OF SETTING SORT OF A FLAT RATE OR A COST RECOVERY RATE OR EVEN MAKING SOME ADJUSTMENTS -- TO SO MANY VARIABLES GO INTO THAT -- I THINK AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FOR WHICH CERTAINLY GOING TO KEEP ALL OF THIS IN MIND -- THUS FAR THOUGH WE HAVEN'T SEEN -- COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT MAKING THAT SHIFT TO A DIFFERENT METHODOLOGY WOULD BE THE WISE THING TO DO YET [inaudible] HI. AND THEN WHEN IT COMES -- SUE THE SSA REIMBURSEMENTS -- I A I DON'T THINK ANYONE WAS SAYING THAT THE DEPARTMENT AND TRIED SPEND THOSE FUNDS WISELY -- I THINK WE'RE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE VOLATILITY OF THE FUNDS SO -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE YOUR CHART FROM WHEN'S LOW SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION AND AS HIGH AS FORTY MILLION SO -- AND I GUESS THE CONCERN IS IS THAT THE WAY WE'RE DOING. THE PAYMENTS -- IN TERMS OF THE PAYMENT HERE I GUESS WE HAVE THIS. MECHANISM THAT WE'RE DOING SO TRYING AVOID LOCKING IN THE HIGHER LEVEL STATE EXPENDITURES -- FOR THE ON THE V. OUR PROGRAM SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE USING THE SSA REIMBURSEMENTS -- TO FUND THE THE INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS BUT I GUESS I I JUST. IN TERMS SO. IN TERMS OF WHERE FALLS ON THE PART OF WHAT HAPPENED SO WHAT HAPPENS IF THE SSA REIMBURSEMENTS ARE LOW RATE WE HAVE A DOWNTURN AND THEY AND THEY DROPPED. IT BUT YOU HAVE WE GOT TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO WE JUST STICK TO THE SSA REIMBURSEMENT AND JUST SQUEEZE EVERYBODY ALL THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS YOU TOLD ME OURS ARE PRIORITY LIST AND THEN WE THEN THINK ABOUT GENERAL FUND OF FUNDS SOME OF THE THE THAT SAID WE DON'T WANT TO CUT IT THAT SEVERELY. SO I THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE THAT WE RAISING IN TERMS OF USING AT THE SSA REIMBURSEMENTS BECAUSE THAT THEY THERE IS SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATION FROM. YEAR TO YEAR IN THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT'S GOING TO COME FROM THAT PARTICULAR SOURCE. I MEAN I THINK. GOOD POINTS IF YOU LOOK AT THE CERTAINLY THE INFORMATION THE AGENDA THAT ROUTE. UP TAKEN REVENUE HAS BEEN THERE BECAUSE IT IT REALLY HAD GONE DOWN. WE ARE CERTAINLY VERY HOPEFUL THAT REVENUE STAYS -- BUT THAT YOU KNOW OVERALL WE ALWAYS LOOK AT OUR RESOURCES YOU KNOW YEAR BY YEAR WE HAVE A FISCAL FORECASTING. THAT ENSURES A WE'RE PROJECTING IN BOTH THE REVENUE THAT'S GOING TO COME IN IN THIS CASE ON THE PROGRAM INCOME. SUCH COOLEY REIMBURSEMENTS -- AS WELL AS OUR EXPENDITURES AND SO AS IT WOULD BE WITHIN THE OTHER TIME WE ARE YOU KNOW OUR RESOURCES WORE TIGHT WE WOULD CERTAINLY BE WORKING -- THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATION AND WITH YOU AS OUR PARTNERS TO ADDRESS THAT THE IT THIS TIME WE'RE NOT SEEING WHERE THAT WILL MATERIALIZE -- AS AN ISSUE OF COURSE YOU KNOW THERE'S TOMORROW'S ECONOMIC CONDITION AND AND WHAT OCCURS WITHOUT BUT WE WOULDN'T SEE THIS ANY DIFFERENT VAN. IF THE PRESSURE WOULD BE ON GENERAL FUND AS AN EXAMPLE. YES FINALLY I'D ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT SO SECURING PERSONS THEY ARE CONNECTED TO THE ECONOMY SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN SEE IN TWENTY TWELVE THERE'S A KIND OF A LOW POINT AND THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S A ONE TO TWO YEAR LACKED WHEN THE REIMBURSEMENTS COME IN BECAUSE OF HOW. SOCIAL SECURITY MINISTRATION WORKS BUT NOW YOU SEE THAT AS OF THIS YEAR'S FORTY MILLION AND TWELVE FOR FIRST YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH IS TIED TO A STRONG ECONOMY AND GETTING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES EMPLOYED SO -- I THAT THE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY HAS SOME INFLUENCE OVER THE THROUGH THEIR YOU KNOW WORK INCENTIVE PLAN IS TRYING TO GET PEOPLE ON EXERCISES DE I AM FLOYD. SO THEY ACTUALLY HAVE CONTROL OVER THIS INTO TO SOME DEGREE WEST GENERAL FUND. IT'S ON THE BROADER ECONOMIC -- CONDITIONS AND IT'S ALSO NECESSARILY A KNOCK WALL TILE -- RIGHT ON BECAUSE OF OUR LINES OF PERSONAL INCOME TAX RETURN SO AT LEAST THIS WE HAVE SOME% INFLUENCE OVER HOW MUCH WEEKEND SO I GUESS I WOULD JUST SAY AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER LA -- WOULD HAVE ANY COMMENT ON THIS IS THAT. RECOGNIZING THE VOLATILITY BOTH OF THE GENERAL FUND HAND OF THIS SOURCE -- NOW I HEAR YEAR TO YEAR I I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A MAYBE A LITTLE MORE STRATEGIC PLANNING ABOUT HOW WE WOULD IF -- AND IT'S A QUESTION SEE IF BECAUSE OF PRIDE THE A WIN. THERE'S A DOWNTURN THAT WE THAT WE CAN SET SOME EXPECTATIONS ABOUT WHAT THAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD YOU KNOW. DO ARE PRIORITIZE IN TERMS OF SOME OF THESE MONIES RIGHT SO I'D SO THAT WE SENATE P. IS THE SAYS I KNOW YOU WORK WITH A LOT OF THE NONPROFIT SUPPORTS OF PEOPLE CAN PLAN OBVIOUSLY NO ONE WANTS TO CUT RIGHT AND DOWN ON BUT I I I I I THINK. THAT -- SETTING SOME EXPECTATIONS ABOUT WHAT IN GENERAL THE PRIORITIES ARE STRATEGY I MEAN WHAT YOU THAT WHAT WE ACTUALLY DO OF COURSE THEN COMES TO A FUTURE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AND FUTURE DECISION BY FUTURE PARTS FINANCES AND DEL AT AND MAYBE GOVERNOR SO WE'VE REALLY LUCKY ON THE REVENUE ALTERNATE. DOWNTURN IN HIS -- EIGHT YEARS IN OFFICE -- BUT BUT I THINK THAT WE MAY WANT IT JUST THINK ABOUT WHAT IT WHAT OUR PRIORITIES GIVEN THE CURRENT FUNDING STRUCTURE AND WHAT WE MIGHT DO IS SO THAT WE CAN SET SOME EXPECTATIONS FOR PEOPLE. TO TO TO AT LEAST BUILD ANTICIPATE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. AND SO WIDE THAT. AND AND I THINK. WE JUST ALL CONCERNED ABOUT TYING SERVE THEM WHAT WHAT THE IMPLICATION OF TYING THIS TO THIS REVENUE SOURCE OF ALRIGHT OKAY. MALES QUESTIONS OKAY WELL LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO BE I. T. INFRASTRUCTURE. I CAN DRESS ISSUE TO BE. AS KATHY MENTIONED A LITTLE BIT EARLIER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES ONE POINT SIX MILLION. DOLLARS FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION IMPROVEMENTS. I DO ARE WE HAVE EIGHTY FIVE DISTRICT AND BRANCH OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHERE MORE THAN THIRTEEN HUNDRED DOOR EMPLOYEES. PROVIDE SERVICES TO OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND CONSUMERS EACH YEAR. I MEAN IN THESE OFFICES THE TECHNOLOGIES ON THE TECHNOLOGY IS OUTDATED AND NEEDS TO BE UPDATED. WITH THIS BUDGET WILL INCREASE INTERNET BANDWIDTH IN THE OFFICES WHICH WILL HELP ADDRESS INEFFICIENCIES ASSOCIATED WITH SLOW INTERNET RESPONSE TIMES. AND ALLOW THE USE OF VIDEO TRAINING FR CONSUMERS VIDEO CONFERENCING WITH PARTNERS AND ONLINE COLLABORATION AND SCREEN SHARING. THE SAME TIME WE WILL ADD WIFI TO THE OFFICES. THIS WILL GIVE CONSUMERS CONNECTIVITY FOR THEIR OWN LAPTOPS AND TABLETS WILL THEY WORK WITH DOOR STAFF ON RESUMES AND JOB APPLICATIONS. IT'LL ALSO ALLOW THEM TO USE ANY SPECIAL SOFTWARE TOOLS THAT THEY HAVE ON THEIR DEVICES AND QUICKLY GET TO THE DATA AND INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO TO TO GET ACCESS. TO WHO ALSO MODERNIZE CERTAIN VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION BUSINESS PROCESSES THROUGH THE USE OF ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES AN ELECTRONIC WORK FLOWS. TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND OUR INTERACTIONS WITH CONSUMERS AND WITH OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS. AND FINALLY AS WE MAKE THESE CHANGES WILL BE IMPLEMENTING CLOUD SERVICES TO INCREASE RELIABILITY AND OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY. NOW CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS THERE. THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS FROM L. L.. A WE WERE JUST A NOTE THAT OUR OFFICE RECOMMENDS APPROVAL OF THIS -- PROPOSALS THAT WOULD LIKELY INCREASE THE EFFICIENCIES IN THE DEPARTMENTS PROCESS HE'S. I THINK YOU FINANCE COMES QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL CERTAINLY WE WANT TO BE SURE YOU HAVE THE I. T. INFRASTRUCTURE THAT YOU NEED. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH THAT IT. IN MAINLY I MEAN TO THIS IS MAINLY LOOKS LIKE IT'S MORE. IT'S THAT IT'S LIKE THE OF FEDERAL STRUCTURE REAL QUICK MEANT CLOUD STUFF LIKE THAT RIGHT SO. OKAY -- AND YOU WORK WITH THE PARK TECHNOLOGY ALRIGHT SO LET'S MOVE ON THEN TO ISSUE TO SEE THE TV I PROGRAM [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE TV I PROGRAM PROVIDE SERVICES THAT ARE POST ACUTE COMMUNITY REINTEGRATION SERVICES. TO CALIFORNIANS WHO'S WHO'S WHO HAVE SUSTAINED A TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY -- THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION IS FINDING SEVEN TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY PROGRAM SITES. SERENA PROXIMALLY NINE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS -- STATEWIDE IN ABOUT TWENTY COUNTIES. I EACH TV I PROGRAM SIDE HAS HISTORICALLY RECEIVED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. THROUGH THE MECHANISM OF THE-STATE PENALTY FUND TRANSFERRING DOLLARS TO THE TV I FUND. WITH THE DECLINE OF THE STATE PENALTY FUND. OF WHICH HAS GONE DOWN APPROXIMATELY 40%. THE DOLLARS NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN THAT HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR HAVE NOT BEEN AVAILABLE. THIS PROPOSAL IS FOR ONE POINT TWO MILLION OF GENERAL FUND BASED ON THE MISSION BASED REVIEW -- AND THAT'S PROPOSED AS ON GOING EXPENSE. THROUGH THE SUNSET THAT WAS ESTABLISHED THROUGH SB THREE NINETY EIGHT OF FOR EACH BUDGET YEAR FOR THE OPERATION OF THE TBI PROGRAM. THE OF FUNDING ARE IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WAS DECREASED TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER SITE. FROM THE HISTORICAL A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER SIDE -- AND THOSE ARE THE THE THAT'S THE INFORMATION ON THE HISTORY OF THE FUNDING -- WHICH WAS THE QUESTION ASKED IN THE AGENDA -- IF THERE'S MORE INFORMATION I'LL HAVE HAPPILY PROVIDED BUT LET ME JUST. ALSO SPEAK TO THE CASELOAD TRENDS WHICH WAS THE SECOND QUESTION -- WE COLLECT DATA -- AS YOU KNOW FOR THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED AS WELL AS THE INFORMATION AND REFERRAL -- SUPPORT SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO THE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN JUST FOR COMPARISON -- NINE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE INDIVIDUALS WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY WERE SERVED IN THOSE TWENTY COUNTIES. AND THERE WERE CUMULATIVE INFORMATION AND REFERRAL SERVICES PROVIDED. OF EIGHT THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE AND THE NINE MONTHS OF EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THAT HAVE TRANSPIRED FROM JULY TO MARCH. THE SITES HAVE SERVED FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE INDIVIDUALS AND A CUMULATIVE INFORMATION REFERRAL TO SIX THOUSAND AND FIFTY TWO REQUESTS FOR SUPPORT -- ALTHOUGH THEY DO ARE IS NOT -- DOES NOT COLLECT NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE. ARE NOT CURRENTLY BEING SERVED. I THINK THAT OF THE DATA OF INDIVIDUALS SERVED AS COMPARED TO THE NUMBER OF INQUIRIES. DOES PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT INTO SOME OF THE NEED. BUT THE DEPARTMENT IS ALSO WORKING ON THE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY ADVISORY BOARD HAS FUNDED BY THE FEDERAL. ADMINISTRATION FOR COMMUNITY LIVING. AND THAT BOARD HAS -- FOR DELIVERABLES. TO COMPLETE BY TWENTY TWENTY MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE ONE IS A NEEDS ASSESSMENT TO IDENTIFY GAPS IN SERVICES. FOR POST ACUTE OF IN SITUATIONS AND COMMUNITY REINTEGRATION. THE SECOND WILL BE ED A TBI DATA REGISTRY WHICH WILL IDENTIFY INCIDENTS AND CAUSATION ANOTHER DEMOGRAPHICS THAT WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE -- BEYOND THE SEVEN SITES THAT WERE WORKING WITH. THAT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF A TBI STATE PLAN. WITH OF I INFORMATION ABOUT POTENTIAL SUSTAINED A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING. TO ADDRESS THE IDENTIFIED NEEDS AND GAPS IN SERVICES AS WELL AS THE WHAT THE REGISTRY REVEALS. FOR THE NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY NEED A COMMUNITY REINTEGRATION SERVICES. SO I'LL STOP THERE. OKAY THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS MILLENNIAL. WITHOUT REGARD TO THE POTENTIAL NEED FOR SERVICES AND THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SEVEN SITES WHICH MAY BE SOMEWHAT ARBITRARY AND IN NUMBER -- IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFIC PROPOSAL TO SHIFT THE THE FUNDING SOURCE GIVEN THAT THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN EXTENDED THROUGH -- TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WE RECOMMEND ADOPTING THE THE PROPOSAL TO A CHANGE THE FUNDING SOURCE TO THE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE IT'S A RELATIVELY MORE STABLE. SOURCE OF FUNDING DESPITE WHAT WE JUST DISCUSSED IN THE PREVIOUS ITEM -- THEN THE THE STATE PENALTY FUND. THANK YOU FINANCE. GEN OKAY MAY MEMBERS OF THE S. CENTER ST FIGURES CHAIR -- ARTICULATE -- EXPLAINED WE HAVE SEVENTY B. I. CENTERS A COVER.

A REGISTRY AND A NEEDS ASSESSMENT WILL GIVE US THE DATA TO SUPPORT OF THE NECESSARY SERVICES AND DEVELOP A STATE PLAN SO WE CAN MOVE TOWARDS. THOSE SERVICES BEING AVAILABLE.

TO I THINK WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHER BEFORE SO WE CAN TO SET THE HIGHLIGHTS ON OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE BEFORE THE DEPARTMENT AND WITH O FOR OF THIS FARCE WHAT. YOU'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT MOVING ON TO THE EXPERT TO YOURSELF THANK YOU WELCOME. GREAT THANK THANK YOU SENATOR PAN -- WHAT I DID WAS I TOOK A LOOK AT OVER THIS LAST YEAR WHAT ARE THE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IN AREAS WHERE WE'VE HAD CHALLENGES AND AREAS WHAT -- SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED -- IT'S IT REALLY IT WAS APPARENT TO ME AS WE WERE -- KIND OF TAKING A LOOK AT THOSE THAT MANY OF THE THINGS THAT ARE OUTLINED IN YOUR AGENDA AND THAT WE'RE GONNA BE DISCUSSING TODAY ACTUALLY ARE VERY CONSISTENT. WITH MANY OF THE CHALLENGES AND% THE SUCCESSES -- OVER OUR CHAIN IS CERTAINLY ARE EVOLVING AND CHANGING SYSTEM AS WE'VE -- MOVED IN CLOSE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS OVER THE MANY YEARS AND MOVING TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY THE THINGS THAT ARE TIED TO THAT TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THOSE EVER CHANGING NEEDS. I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME HIGHLIGHTS THAT BEEN GOING ON OVER THIS LAST YEAR IN CLOSING THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS WE'VE BEEN -- CLOSING THREE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AT UPON THE ANNOUNCEMENT MAY. TWENTY FIFTEEN AND SO IN DOING SO THAT COMES WITH PARTICULAR CHALLENGES CERTAINLY AT THE VERY TAIL END OF OF THE CLOSURE WHEN YOU WERE REALLY TAKING A LOOK AT HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE KIND OF MERGING THE TWO AS FAR AS MOVING FOLKS TO THE COMMUNITY. FINALIZING THE HOUSING TAKING -- CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE STAFF THAT ARE OVER THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS BUT I'M HAPPY TO REPORT EVEN THROUGH ALL THOSE CHALLENGES -- THAT WE ACTUALLY -- DID ACHIEVE HAVING LAST PERSON MOVE OUT A CINEMA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER -- AND WE ARE MOVING TOWARDS -- THE OTHER INDIVIDUALS AND I'LL GIVE THAT UP A LITTLE BIT LATER IN THE AGENDA -- BUT ONE OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED OVER THIS LAST YEAR IS THE FINAL DEVELOPMENT OF ABOUT FORTY FOUR HOMES TO SUPPORT THAT CLOSURE. SO THAT'S JUST BEEN OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS ALSO WHEN WE ARE TAKING A LOOK AT OUR TOTAL POPULATION WHEN WE ANNOUNCED THE CLOSURE WE HAD -- STARTED WITH A POPULATION FOR CLOSURE PURPOSES OF EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX AND OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS WITH THE TRANSITIONS WERE DOWN UNDER A HUNDRED AS FAR AS INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE MOVING OUT. WE ALSO -- AS MANY CALIFORNIANS THAT WE'RE FACED WITH THE NUMBER OF FIRES YOU KNOW THE REGIONAL CENTERS PORT A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES WITHIN THE COMMUNITY IS IS BEING RESPONSIVE IN MAKING SURE THAT THOSE SERVICES ARE. AVAILABLE ON EMERGENCY NEED DURING THAT TIME THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND I'M TRYING TO GIVE THEM SUPPORT THAT THE EVACUATION OF THE DIFFERENT FIRES WAS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. WHO HAVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES THAT WERE EVACUATED DURING THAT TIME PERIOD? THEY WERE -- A HIGHLY RESPONSIVE -- BUT IT WAS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US IS THE DEPARTMENT TO PAY IT FORWARD A LITTLE BIT -- AND SUPPORT THE FOLKS THAT -- HAD CHALLENGES DURING THIS TIME -- IF YOU RECALL -- DURING THE FIRES IN CINEMA THAT WE WERE EVACUATED OUT OF CINEMA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER AND WE HAD -- JUST OVER TWO HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS AT THAT TIME A COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT WE HAD TO EVACUATE THIS YEAR WE'RE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. SO AS INDIVIDUALS NEEDED A PLACE TO STAY AT SO NO MY WE'RE ABLE TO SUPPORT ELEVEN INDIVIDUALS WHY WERE STILL IN OPERATION. THAT NEEDED A PLACE TO STAY FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS WERE ABLE TO BRING THEM IN ON EMERGENCY BASIS. OVER AT PORTER BILL WE WERE ABLE TO BRING IN SEVENTEEN INDIVIDUALS -- THAT WERE -- EVACUATED BECAUSE OF THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES -- SO IT REALLY IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN -- A SUCCESS FOR OUR SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO SAY EVEN DURING THE CRISIS AND AND HAVING TO FACE THESE CHALLENGES. THAT COLLECTIVELY PEOPLE COME TOGETHER TO PROVIDE THOSE SUPPORTS -- SELF DETERMINATION -- IT'S IT'S AN A HIGH FOCUS FOR OUR DEPARTMENT CERTAINLY FOR OUR COMMUNITY. I'M HAPPY TO SAY OVER THIS LAST YEAR WE RECEIVED APPROVAL ON OUR WAIVER TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH SELF DETERMINATION -- WHILE WE CONTINUE TO SEE. PROGRESS AND AND HAPPY TO REPORT THAT -- EACH REGIONAL CENTER EITHER EITHER HAVE COMPLETED THEIR ORIENTATIONS OR HAVE THEM SCHEDULED. TO BE ABLE TO HELP THE PARTICIPANTS MOVE FORWARD YOU KNOW WHILE WE KNOW THAT THIS HAS BEEN A PARTICULAR TO ALLEN TO TRYING TO GET THINGS OPERATIONAL IT'S A NEW WAVER. YOU KNOW AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN TIMES WHEN THERE'S BEEN SOME CHALLENGES IN FRUSTRATION BY OUR COMMUNITY AS TO HOW LONG IT'S TAKEN -- BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CELEBRATE THE SUCCESS -- IN BEING ABLE TO MOVE THAT FORWARD. WE ALSO -- JUST RECENTLY -- RECEIVED APPROVAL ON A LICENSE OF OUR COMMUNITY STAR HOME. SO A Q. CRISIS SERVICES IS ONE OF THE HOMES THAT WE ARE DEVELOPING AS PART OF KIND OF OUR SAFETY NET THAT STATE OPERATED -- JUST TO KIND OF REFRESH YOUR MEMORY THAT WE ARE OPERATING -- ONE STAR HOME AT CINEMA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER AND THEN ONE AT IF YOU WERE CERTAINLY EXPANDING THEM BUT BECAUSE OF THE DEVELOPMENT WE ARE MOVING ONE OF THE HOMES TO THE COMMUNITY. THAT IS A HOME THAT JUST GOT LICENSED YOU WOULD THINK INTUITIVELY THAT THIS WOULD BE AN EASY TASK FOR US TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEVELOP ONE HOME FOR FIVE INDIVIDUALS GET IT LICENSE. BUT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU COULD YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING DOWN THAT PATH AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO OPERATIONALIZE IT CAME WITH. INTERESTING CHALLENGES EVERYTHING FROM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MANAGE TO SEPTIC SYSTEMS HOW TO DO DIFFERENT THINGS AND I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S KIND OF A SMALL TASK BUT IT IS THE FRAMEWORK. FOR ALL OF THE DEVELOPMENT THAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING AS A STATE OPERATED IN OUR QUEUE CRISIS AS WE MOVE TO THE COMMUNITY -- I'D ALSO LIKE. TO SAY THAT IN TAKING A LOOK AT THE CHALLENGES THAT OUR COMMUNITY IS FACING AS FAR AS SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO OCCURRING NEEDS TAKING A LOOK AT THE GROWTH IN OUR SYSTEM. WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE GROWTH IN OUR SYSTEM IS VERY SIGNIFICANT WERE GROWING BY ABOUT TWELVE TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT AN AVERAGE SIZE REGIONAL CENTER? IT IS ABOUT THAT SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT ARE PROJECTED -- CENSUS IN NINETEEN TWENTY THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT SERVING APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. KIND OF OF NOTE WHEN WE LOOK BACK -- IN OUR HISTORY ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO WE WERE JUST ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND LESS THAN THAN WHAT WE ARE TODAY. SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE GROWTH IS CERTAINLY THERE -- WE ARE ALSO -- VERY PLEASED TO SAY THAT THIS IS THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS SAID WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE THE FUNDS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR COMMUNITY PLACEMENT PLAN FOR A DIFFERENT PURPOSE AND IT SUPPORTING DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES UNDER THE COMMUNITY RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT SERVICES. AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE WERE ABLE TO SEE SOME VERY UNIQUE PROJECTS THAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS IN THE COMMUNITY IDENTIFIED TO SUPPORT THE LOCAL NEEDS -- AS A RESULT WE SAW FIVE ADDITIONAL MULTI FAMILY HOUSES HOUSING EFFORTS THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED -- TO EXPAND OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- UNITS WE'RE ALSO SEEING THAT THERE IS SOME NEW -- PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED ON EMPLOYMENT TRAINING THAT IS GOING TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC EMPLOYMENT. TRAINING TO THIRTY FIVE EMPLOYMENT SPECIALIST AND THEN THERE IS AN EXPANSION AN EARLY START SO WE'RE REALLY PLEASED TO SEE THAT WERE ABLE TO DO SOME IT EXPANDED WORK WITHIN. THE COMMUNITY SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT THERE'S TWO QUESTIONS THAT -- ARE ADDED IN THE AGENDA THAT YOU -- YOU WANTED US TO EXPAND ON AND SO WE DO HAVE DEPUTY -- ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR JIM NIGHT HERE TO PROVIDE SOME RESPONSES FOR YOU. HI THANK YOU YES THE FIRST OF ALL ON THE ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION SYSTEM AND I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE SPEAKING ON THAT THE NEXT -- PART OF THE AGENDA SO JUST BRIEFLY YOU KNOW WE ARE WORKING WITH -- THE OFFICES SYSTEM INTEGRATION DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS AS A A COLLECTIVE APPROACH AND LOOKING AT WHAT -- THE THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME MAY BE SO THERE IS A SPRING FINANCE LETTER THAT WE'LL BE DISCUSSING LATER AND SO JUST WANT TO MAKE. SURE THAT A BIG PART OF THAT IS REALLY THE STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT TO SUPPORT AND RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S A BIG PIECE OF WHAT WE DO TO HELP INFORM US MOVING FORWARD -- THEN ALSO NEXT IS ON MINIMUM WAGE AND ABOUT THE DECREASE IN MINIMUM WAGE AND AND THIS CURRENT BUDGET AND SO SEVEN AND AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE SEEN -- OVER THE YEARS WITH ALL THE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES THAT WE'VE DONE SOME ADJUSTMENTS AFTER LOOKING BACK AT WHAT THE ACTUAL IS HAVE BEEN AND AND JUST MAKING DE. IN AND DEVELOPING ESTIMATES FOR WHAT THE MINIMUM WAGE IMPACT IS GOING TO BE IT'S IT'S A BIT OF A CHALLENGE FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. ONE WE DON'T HAVE WE DON'T HIRE FOLKS DIRECTLY SO WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY EMPLOYEES THERE ARE AND WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY GETTING PAID. AND THEN ALSO SME SOME INTERMEDIATE THINGS THAT OCCUR AS WELL WHEN WE START TO GET A TREND WE ALSO HAVE SOME OTHER -- FACTORS SUCH AS RATE INCREASES THAT CAME IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN WHERE WE SAW SLOW DOWN THEN AND MINIMUM WAGE. AND IN THE LIKE INTO ALSO ANYTHING SO SOMEONE ASKING WHAT ARE SOME OF THE REASONS BEHIND THAT I MEAN IT JUST REALLY IS THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE PUT IN AND THEN WE TRY AND IN THE ESTIMATE AND WE TRY TO UPDATE BASED ON ACTUAL AS AS WE MOVE. FORWARD -- BUT IT IS IT IS A CHALLENGE IN DOING THAT WE ARE SEEING AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF REQUESTS THIS YEAR THEY'VE BEEN ABOUT TWICE AS MANY THIS YEAR'S THERE WERE LAST YEAR. YEAH -- OVER THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS WILL HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT THAT FISCAL IMPACT IS. IN THAT SOMETHING ACTUALLY BEEN EXPECTING AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN -- WITH OUR MINIMUM WAGE ESTIMATE HAS BEEN -- DO WE WE HAVE BEEN -- THE CAREFUL TO BRING IT DOWN TOO MUCH KNOWING THAT IS THE MINIMUM WAGE CONTINUES TO GO UP IS GONNA BE MORE MORE EMPLOYEES. ALSO THERE'S A REQUEST FOR AN ESTIMATE -- ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE FOR THOSE. PROVIDERS AND LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE AREAS WE DID -- PROVIDE THAT LAST NIGHT I BELIEVE ACTUALLY TO THE LA -- AND CERTAINLY I KNOW THERE'S SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS I WILL BE HAPPY TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THOSE WITH THEM THANK YOU. LA -- AND I GUESS HE JUST GOT SOME STUFF LAST NIGHT. WE DID WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT -- SONY PETTITTE KALLIO -- JUST REAL QUICK A IN CASE YOU'VE FORGOTTEN -- THIS IS AN ISSUE WE BROUGHT UP LAST YEAR REGARDING THE LOCAL MINIMUM WHAT WE'RE CALLING IT THE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE QUIRK. YES YES IS WHERE THE THE THE SERVICE PROVIDERS IN AREAS THAT HAVE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE ORDINANCES ARE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS THE INCREASES ASSOCIATED WITH THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE AND THE I'M SORRY NOT ABLE TO ACCESS THE READ ADJUSTMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE. INCREASES SO THEY THEY'RE SORT OF HIT TWO FOLD. ONE THEY HAVE TO PAY A HIGHER. WAGE BECAUSE OF THE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE ORDINANCE WITH NO COMMENSURATE INCREASE IN REVENUES AND THEN THEY ALSO ARE UNABLE TO ACCESS THE RATE ADJUSTMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE. SO WITH ALL THAT SAID -- WE SUSPECTED THAT THIS COULD ALSO BE ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THE THE DEPARTMENT'S ESTIMATES OF FOR THE COST OF STATE MINIMUM WAGE HAVE COME IN A BIT LOWER -- THEY WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE US LAST NIGHT WITH AN ESTIMATE SO IF THE MINIMUM WAGE WAS PROVIDED TO ALL SERVICE PROVIDERS STARTING WITH THE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE IT WILL COST ABOUT. SIXTEEN MILLION TOTAL FUNDS ABOUT EIGHT MILLION GENERAL FUND AMOUNT -- ONE OF THE THINGS THE DEPARTMENT REMINDED US OF IS THAT -- SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE RESIDENTIAL SERVICES IN COMMUNITY CARE FACILITIES. ACROSS THE STATE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY'RE IN AN AREA WITH A LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE ORDINANCE ALREADY BENEFIT FROM THE STATE -- THE INCREASE IS PROVIDED FOR STATE MINIMUM WAGE BECAUSE THE THE RATE IS SET AT A STATEWIDE LEVEL BY THE DEPARTMENT -- SO I GUESS IN CLOSING SORRY IDEA IT DIDN'T REALLY SOME OF THE POINT THAT ARE IN ALICE IN OUR ANALYSIS WE HAD RECOMMENDED -- THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER WHETHER THIS WAS THEIR INTENT TO CREATE THE SYSTEM WHERE THE THE SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE AREAS WITH LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE ORDINANCES COULD NOT ACCESS THE STATE PROVIDED -- READING TREES AND IF THEY DID NOT INTEND THAT THAN TO DO SOME STATUTORY CLEANUP THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO ACCESS THIS BENEFIT PERHAPS STARTING JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY OKAY ANYTHING AMISS ABOUT ANY OTHER PARTS OF THIS OVERVIEW -- NO NOT WILL GET INTO THINGS AND OTHER ISSUES THANK YOU OKAY FINANCE. YES THE JUST AND AND COMMENT ON THE FISCAL ASSOCIATED WITH THE MINIMUM WAGE TO THAT WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING I THINK I WOULD HIGHLY CAN CARRY ON IT WITH YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON SOME POTENTIAL TAKE OPERATES. AND ALSO BASED UPON AND THOSE ARE DEVELOPED BASED UPON THE AXLES THAT WE DO HAVE AND THEN AGAIN I MEAN JUST JUST THE ECHO -- MISTER NIGHTS -- COMMENTS SPECIFIC TO THE UNKNOWNS OF THE MINIMUM WAGE ITSELF IT SAYS THAT'S OUR BEST GUESS AT THIS TIME SO I JUST WANNA. PUT THAT CARRY OUT OUT THERE THAT [inaudible] YEAH. YEAH ROUGH NUMBERS BUT BASED UPON OUR ASSUMPTIONS AT THIS TIME SO I DID SO JUST TO CLARIFY TO AND THAT FIVE MAKE IN A RAINY ASSUMPTION PLEASE CORRECT ME SO. BASICALLY YOU KNOW WE HAVE PROVIDERS AND VARIOUS DIFFERENT LOCALITIES THAT MAY HAVE DIFFERENT LOCAL MINIMUM WAGES RATE AND SO A PROVIDER WHO IS IN A AREAS WITH HIGH LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE -- YOU REIMBURSE THEM AT DO YOU TAKE ACCOUNT OF THAT ONE IN TERMS OF THEIR PAYMENTS ARE NOT. SOME WEIGHT. WELL YOU CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION A I THINK THE AUDIENCE I HAS A NO. RIGHT YEAH BECAUSE THE THE LAW RIGHT NOW AS FAR AS FOR A MINIMUM WAGE -- SAYS THAT WE CAN ONLY PROVIDE -- INCREASES IF NECESSARY TO PAY THE RIGHT STATE MINIMUM OKAY ALL RIGHT SO JUST CUT BY THAT SO. AND AND SO NOW OF COURSE WITH THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE GOING UP WE ALLOCATE SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDS. FOR THEM -- TO PROVIDERS TO JUST FOR THE INCREASING STATE MINIMUM WAGE SO. THE PROVIDERS IN THE HIGH LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE AREA REYES WHO'S A READY HAVING TO BECAUSE IF THE BAY TO LOCAL LAWS PAYING THE HIGHER RATE. ARETHE ABLE TO SO SINCE THEY'RE READY PAYING A HIGHER RATE BUT THEIR ACTUAL REIMBURSEMENTS FACED ON THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE. FIVE IT'S NOT BASED ON THE STATE MINIMUM WAGES BASED ON WHATEVER THEIR RATE WAS. THANK AT AT AT AT OKAY AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS SO. SO THEN THE FOR THAT THAT'S ONE GET A AYE AYES SIDE OKAY SO SO THE SO THE PROBLEM IS NOW THAT WHEN WE SAY WE'LL HEAR SOME MONEY TO ADDRESS THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE. THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO ACCESS BECAUSE OF ALL WILL YOU'RE READY PAYING AT HIGHER AT THE HIGHER RATE BUT YET. WHATEVER THE RATE THAT WAS SET BEFORE. DIDN'T REALLY TAKE A CAB A LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE RATES SO THAT'S THE TWO FOR PROBLEM OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO -- SO I I HEARD LIKE ESTIMATES AND STUFF LIKE BY ME IN TERMS OF POLICY SHOULD AND THEY HAVE ACCESS [inaudible] TO V.. STATE MINIMUM WAGE THAT TO INCREASE REIMBURSEMENT. EVEN THOUGH THEY TECHNICALLY AREN'T PAYING THEIR PEOPLE MORE BUT I MEAN WE SAID A REIMBURSEMENT IT WASN'T BASED ON THEIR LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE. I GUESS THAT'S THE QUESTION HELLO WHAT'S WHAT'S WHAT'S WHAT'S WHAT'S WHAT'S AYE AYE CLARIFY WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION IS ON THIS. AS SOON HAVE MY OWN OPINIONS BUT THAT. IS NOT WHAT THE MINISTRATIONS POSITION ON THIS [inaudible] YES IT. THE POSITION IS IS THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE PAID BELOW. THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE -- THAT'LL STATE MINIMUM WAGE THEN THEY'LL ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE. THAT INCREASE. WILL. IF THE RATES ARE BELOW THE MINIMUM WAGE BUT THEY'RE PAYING HIGHER BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO MEET THE LOCAL MINIMUM RIGHT AGE BUT AND THE RATE AT WHICH THEY'RE BEING REIMBURSED DID NOT TAKE THAT AND THE COUNTY JUST SORT OF MADE IT WORK. RIGHT OR OF THE AND THE STATE'S POSITION IS WE DON'T FIND WE DON'T SUPPORT THE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE. OKAY BUT WE SUPPORT THE STATE MINIMUM WAGERATE. SO WE SHOULD AT LEAST IF WE HAVE OUR STATE MINIMUM WAGE IS GOING UP WE SHOULD MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENT FOR AT LEAST THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE AND IF THEIR RATES ARE BELOW THAT THEN THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT INCREASE AND IF THEY'RE READY PAYING HIGHER. THAN THAT BECAUSE THE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE STATION. EVEN THOUGH THE STATEMENT WAY I REALIZE THAT TECHNICALLY THE WAGES OF THEIR EMPLOYEES HAVEN'T CHANGED BECAUSE THE SEED AWAY TO STILL MAY BE BEHIND FOR THE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGES. BUT ALSO THE ORIGINAL RATE THAT THEY WERE REIMBURSED LIST DIDN'T TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE RATE WHICH IS HIGHER CORRECT. YEAH AND AND THAT'S WHAT THE ESTIMATE I BELIEVE THAT THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDED WAS SUPPOSED TO REFLECT IS WHAT THAT. COST WOULD BE TO FIND AT THAT INCREASE. OKAY SO THE ESTIMATE IS TO INCREASE MATTER WHICH LOCALITY URINE. YEAH THAT WAS THE ESTIMATE -- THEY PROVIDED IT WAS LIKE ALRIGHT PROVIDERS REGARDLESS. FOR THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE IN RIGHT NOT THE LOCAL MEN OKAY AND THE NUMBERS THAT I GAVE YOU WOULD BE A HALF YEAR COSTS BECAUSE IT WOULD BE WITH THE BRING THEM ON YEAH OKAY SO WE WILL SO THE INTENTION IS THAN. TO BOB SURE AMANDA ROVIDES LIKE WILL WANT YOU JUST PAY IS EXACTLY WHAT THAT BUT AT LEAST WE'RE GOING TO GIVE. THEM AN ADJUSTMENT BASED ON THE INCREASE IN THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE. EVERYONE WHEN YOU SAY INTENT I I THINK WE WERE ASKED TO PROVIDE. ON THAT. OKAY RIGHT RIGHT FISCAL ON THAT OKAY BUT WHAT THAT WOULD COST OKAY THERE'S CURRENTLY NO PROPOSAL DID OKAY FROM HER EIGHT MINISTRATION JUST TO BE CLEAR OKAY. ALL RIGHT. SO I WOULD SUGGEST PERHAPS WE ARE THINK ABOUT THAT. OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO -- I I HOPE I HOPE IN THE MAY REVISE SHOWS A FULL HEAD OF A PROPOSAL THIS ON THE TEACHER RELATED TO THAT ARE WE WILL HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT I APPRECIATE THE CALCULATION. MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO HAVING DISCUSSIONS OKAY ALL RIGHT I GUESS I CAN ASK MORE THAN THAT RIGHT NOW. BUT IN THE WEEK I THINK WE CAN TALK MORE. OKAY ALL RIGHT BUT I MEAN DOES THAT MAKE SENSE RIGHT BACK TO YOUR SITE I KNOW YOU HAVE TO THE GOVERNOR'S LINE BUT WHAT WHAT HE WANTS I THOUGHT I WAS JUST GOING. TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT YOU KNOW WE WILL CONTINUE AS AS FINANCES SAID OR WERE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN ANY FISCAL AND HAVE A CONVERSATION -- SO WELCOME THOSE DISCUSSIONS -- WILL CONTINUE -- TO REVIEW I WILL SAY THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING TO WORK WITH THE PROVIDERS IN THE REGIONAL CENTERS IN THE DIFFERENT AREAS THAT. WERE PROVIDERS HAVE FACED DIFFERENT ISSUES BUT ONE OF THEM THAT HAS BEEN PRESSURES. TO DO WITH WAGES WHETHER IT'S WITH LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE RATHER PRESSURES -- WHILE IT IS AN ONEROUS PROCESS IN SOME SITUATIONS THERE IS THE HEALTH AND SAFETY -- OPTION BE ABLE TO MAKE A REQUEST TO THE DEPARTMENT -- TO HAVE AN ADJUSTMENT -- WHILE SOME MAY NOT FIND IT TO BE THE MOST POPULAR PATH TO TAKE IT IS AN OPTION -- TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE RECEIVING SERVICES. ALRIGHT WELL I AND I KNOW WE DISCUSSED THAT BEFORE -- I GUESS IN SOME SENSES -- TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU HOW HE GETS RATIONALIZE THE WE WERE DOING A REIMBURSEMENT SO [inaudible] ASSEMBLY OKAY. ALL RIGHT WELL I HAVE A SECOND A CONVERSATION TO BE CONTINUED OKAY [inaudible] ALL RIGHT [inaudible] OKAY WELL. RIGHT IN THE RIGHT WELL LET'S GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON THEN -- ISSUE NUMBER -- TWO THIS RECIPROCAL IS ON THIS FOR THE NOSE ACCIDENTAL. OKAY SO ACTUALLY WHAT WE DO IS MAYBE JUST ASK PEOPLE TO SHIFT OVER -- AROUND SO WE HAVE SOME SPACE THE FRONT SO WE HAVE. A PROPOSAL -- THE PANEL ON IMPLEMENTATION THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE IN HALF DAY BILLING POLICY AND I THINK WE HAVE A JORDAN LINDSAY IS A DIRECTOR OF THE ARK CALIFORNIA AND NANCY CHANCE EXEC DIRECTOR OF CHOICES PERSON CENTERED SERVICES [inaudible] WELCOME [inaudible] SO. IF YOU CAN KEEP YOUR REMARKS TWO UNDER THREE MINUTES. I THINK IF THIS IS AN ISSUE. YEP. AND THAT SAID THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE I THINK WE HAVE HEARD BEFORE HER IN VARIOUS ITERATIONS SO -- SO ANYWAY THAT THANK YOU WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JORDAN AND SEE WITH THE ARK UNITED CIVIL POLICY YES YOU HAVE HEARD THIS LAST YEAR -- BUT I WAS ASKED TO PROVIDE AGAIN A LITTLE BACKGROUND AT LEAST TO HOW WE GOT HERE I'LL BE VERY QUICK ABOUT THAT -- BUT I DO WANT TO GIVE THE OVER ARCHING UMBRELLA THAT. IN ADDITION TO EVERYTHING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND HOW THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORTS AND SERVICES FOR PEOPLE INTELLECTUALS ABILITIES IS. REALLY KIND OF IN A CRISIS MODE. STARTING JULY FIRST WERE LORD STERN AND ANOTHER CUT. IN TIMES OF SURPLUS RIGHT NOW SO THAT'S OVER ARCHING OF ALL THESE COMMENTS -- IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THE STATE FACE AN UNPRECEDENTED BUDGET SHORTFALL OF COURSE AND TO DO THE ULTIMATE REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT VITAL SERVICES TO REDUCE OUR BUDGET BY THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES. DRASTIC CUTS TO SERVICES WERE REQUIRED. AMONG THEM WAS THAT FOURTEEN THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE AND HALF THE BILLING. IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE ARC OF CALIFORNIA AND UNITS WILL PULL THE SAN DIEGO FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE CITY CALIFORNIA BLOCKED IMPLEMENTATION THE CUTS. AT THE DEEMED HARMFUL IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE DISTRICT COURT RULED AGAINST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IN OUR FAVOR AND A FEDERAL LAWSUIT DECLINE THAT THE STATE YOU LEGALLY CUT THE FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS. THE RULING AUTUMN WE FOUND THAT THE STATE FAILED TO COMPLY WITH MEDICAID REQUIREMENTS -- HOWEVER IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE ORDER WAS VACATED AS YOU KNOW WHEN THIRD PARTIES Là STANDING IN MEDICAID -- SUITS HOWEVER WAS NOT BEEN ENFORCED SINCE. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THEN LAST YEAR -- PROPOSED IN THIS -- BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARING AS WELL AS AN ASSEMBLY SIDE WAS THE RE ENFORCEMENT OF THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE. MAKE A NOTE HOWEVER THAT IN THIS COMMITTEE THE HALF THE BUILDING WAS NOT ACTUALLY HEARD LAST YEAR -- YOU MADE VERY POIGNANT REMARKS LAST YEAR TALKING ABOUT FOR LOW DAYS AND HOW YOU EXPERIENCE FOR LOW DAYS TEN YEARS AGO WHEN THINGS ARE BAD -- IS A REALLY UNNECESSARY -- IS IT NECESSARY TO CONTINUE TO FURLOUGH DAYS WHICH IS WHAT WE CONSIDER THEM TO BE -- THE HALF THE BILLION WAS IN FORCE CAUSING IMMEDIATE IMPACTS TO THE COMMUNITY LAST YEAR AND AS I ALREADY SAID JULY FIRST FOR STARING RIGHT AT A CUT. TO FAMILIES SERVICES INDIVIDUALS AND THE SUPPORT THAT THEY REQUIRE. A QUICK UPDATE ON THE LAWSUIT AS WELL. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTUALLY IN THEIR OWN COMMENTS -- PAST REQUEST OF THE COURT TO DELAY THIS CASE BECAUSE IN THEIR OWN COMMENTS THEY SAID WELL THE LEGISLATURE ALMOST ACTED ON THIS LAST YEAR. THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO ACT ON IT THIS YEAR SO LET'S NOT BOTHER THE COURTS WITH IT. WE SAID WELL WE WE HOPE THAT'S THE CASE BUT WE CAN'T RELY ON THAT SO ON JULY THIRTY FIRST THERE IS A SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE -- ON THESE TWO ISSUES THAT WILL TAKE PLACE -- AND WE HOPE HOWEVER WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS OR THROUGH THE COURTS THAT I'M NOT ONLY WILL WE SEE THE HALF THE BILLING. ELIMINATED THAT BUT ALSO THAT OF WHAT IS COMING RIGHT AT US WILL BE STOPPED TOM WITH THE REINFORCEMENT OF THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE THANK YOU. A NANCY CHANCE I'M A FAMILY MEMBER I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CHOICES PERSON CENTERED SERVICES AND A MEMBER OF CD CAN. AND A PATH FORWARD COLLABORATIVE. THANKS FOR THEM GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY I'M. I AM ALSO HERE TO DISCUSS THE FOURTEEN DAY UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE -- I THINK THE THE THING THAT STRIKES ME FIRST IS THAT AS A STATE THAT'S WORKING TOWARDS THE HOME AND GET UP YOU COMPLIANCE WITH THE HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES WAIVER -- THIS IS IN DIRECT CONTRADICTION TO THE PRINCIPLES OF A CBS AND AS IT IT DOESN'T ALLOW FOR INDIVIDUAL CHOICE AND PROBABLY LIKELY WILL -- AFFECT A PERSON'S ABILITY. TO TO KEEP AN EMPLOYMENT YOU KNOW IT'LL HINDER THEIR OPPORTUNITIES. BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T HAVE SOMEONE TO SUPPORT THEM A TO GO TO WORK ON AND THE DAY AFTER THANKSGIVING OR YOU KNOW -- MEMORIAL DAY THEN THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO WORK AND THEN THAT THAT'S A PROBLEM SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK INITIALLY JUST AS JORDAN SAID. WHAT WE NEED TO CLARIFY THAT THIS IS NOT A HOLIDAY THESE ARE NOT PAID HOLIDAYS THIS IS THESE ARE FOR LOTUS? EATER FOURTEEN FURLOUGH DAYS IT. TOO AND A SYSTEM THAT FOR YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR TODAY AND A SPECIALLY ON MAY NINTH THAT IS IN CRISIS AND HERE WE ARE. WE'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT A CUT AT A TIME WHEN WE'RE IN CRISIS. I THINK IT'S A NECESSARY -- AND AGAIN I DON'T THINK IT'S H. E. B. S. COMPLIANT AND LASTLY -- I THINK THAT I DO YOU KNOW WHAT. WE NEED TO CONSIDER THE SYSTEM IN THE SOUTH AND AND WE NEED TO CONSIDER -- MAYBE NOT HAVING HOLIDAYS AT ALL -- YOU KNOW THAT ARE. THAT ARE MANDATED -- SO I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU TO REPEAT RESEND THE THE THIS PROPOSAL -- AND THAT THE STATE LAW THAT THAT WOULD CAUGHT WOULD PUT THIS IN PLACE. AND IF NOT AT THE VERY LEAST DELAY IMPLEMENTATION -- UNTIL THE RATE ISSUES AND THE H. CBS ISSUES ARE -- KIND OF CLARIFIED. MISTER CHAIRMAN MAY I APOLOGIZE FOR HAD ONE WORD -- QUESTION -- REGARDING THE FIFTY POINT THREE MILLION AND IT'S IT'S JUST A QUESTION ON THE THE STAFF TO BE MAYES JOB WITH THE AGENDA. WE JUST WEREN'T CLEAR IF THAT IS FOR ALL FOURTEEN DAYS IS IT FOUR DAYS -- REGARDING THE BUDGET ITSELF I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS AN ANSWER ON THAT. I WAS JUST HOPEFUL TO GET CLARIFICATION ON THAT. YEAH ACTUALLY DIED PERHAPS A YEAH DO YOU WANT CLEAR FIGHT WITH THE THAT AMOUNT IS. MISTER CHAIR -- THE THE FIFTY POINT THREE MILLION IS DERIVED. CAN BE DERIVED A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN WHAT WE'RE ASSUMING BASICALLY. IS THAT -- FOURTEEN REGIONAL CENTERS. HAD SEVEN DAY HOLIDAY SCHEDULES PRIOR. TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ROLE. AND SO SEVEN DAYS ARE BEING ADDED BACK INTO THE ESTIMATE FOR THAT. AND THEN THE REMAINING SEVEN REGIONAL CENTERS WHERE IT TEN DAYS PRIOR SO. THE ESTIMATE ASSUMES THAT FOUR DAYS ARE BEING ADDED BACK FOR THAT. IN THAT AND THEN WE BASE IT ON THE COST PER DAY OF PROVIDING SERVICES BUT THE CLEAR FIVE IS IT SAYS SO IF WE REPEAL THE FOURTEEN DAY SCHEDULE TO COST IS FIFTY POINT THREE MILLION. THIRTY POINT ONE MILLION GENERAL FUND OR IS IT JUST. OKAY SO THAT'S NOT JUST DIALING IT BACK. TO THE DAYS AND FORTY ASSUME THAT SOME REGIONAL CENTERS -- YOU HAVE TAKE HOLIDAYS IT WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T BE ZERO HOLIDAYS IT WOULD ASSUME THAT ON AVERAGE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE TAKING SEVEN TO EIGHT HALL. HOLIDAYS A YEAR. BUT CONSIDERED STILL BE HOLIDAYS OKAY. SO IF I MAY ASK PLEASE FINANCE I THINK. LIKE MANY JOBS EVERYONE HOW IT TAKES HOLIDAYS OFF I THINK WITH THIS ACTION THAT WAS TAKEN SEVERAL YEARS AGO THERE WAS TWO THINGS THAT HAPPENED. ONE IT'S THAT. SPECIFIC DAYS IN WHICH HOLIDAYS WERE TO BE TAKEN SO THERE WAS SOME UNIFORMITY HENCE THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY -- TITLE SO THE SOME UNIFORMITY SO SAVINGS IN THAT REGARD AND THEN IN ADDITION THERE WAS SOME SAVINGS WITH REGARDS TO HOW MANY DAYS WERE TO BE TAKEN. SO IT'S IT'S A IT'S A LITTLE TOO FOLDED TYPE OF ISSUE OKAY SURE BUT I THINK AS MISTER DOYLE NOTED IS IS THAT. THERE ARE STILL ASSUMPTIONS THAT. SOME DAYS WILL BE TAKEN THEY JUST WON'T BE TAKING UNIFORMLY CRACKED YES. OKAY ALL RIGHT SO THE SO THE AMOUNTS SOON'S THAT THEY'LL BE. BUT STE FOR SEVEN DAYS -- SOME. SEVEN EIGHT DEPENDING SEVEN THE EIGHT HOLIDAYS AT THE WITH SALT OKAY I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY WHAT THE AMOUNT IS OKAY. ALL RIGHT WELL EXCEED SO LET ME JUST -- ANY OTHER COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSAL FROM THE ADVOCATES FROM THE AGENCIES MAY BE. ON THIS -- MISTER LINDSEY AND MISS CHANCE POINTED OUT YOU KNOW THESE WERE IMPLEMENTED WHEN THE STATE WAS TRYING TO SOLVE IT TWENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SHORTFALL IN THE GENERAL FUND. SO MANY OF THE PROPOSALS THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED THAT TIME REMAIN IN FACT AND SO THESE ARE PROPOSALS THAT. WELL THEIR PROBLEMATIC NO QUESTION ON THEY HAVE REMAINED IN FACT OKAY. ALL RIGHT AWAY OF SNATE PARA KALLIO -- I JUST I ACTUALLY ALSO WANNA JUST RAISE A A POINT OF THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO TO ALSO THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE THE REGIONAL CENTERS OBSERVING THEIR OWN HOLIDAY SCHEDULES EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF A STATE WIDE POLICY -- I THINK SOMETIMES IT'S EASY TO FORGET THAT THESE WHOLE THESE HOLIDAYS ARE FERTILIZER HOWEVER PEOPLE ON A REFER TO THEM -- REALLY ONLY AFFECT A CERTAIN SERVICE CATEGORIES SO IT'S LIKE DAY PROGRAMS WORK ACTIVITY PROGRAM SO. IT'S NOT AFFECTING LIKE THE CORNERS ARE RESIDENTIAL SERVICES AND THAT SORT OF THING SO A LOT OF THESE DAY PROGRAMS MIGHT NOT BE OPERATING ON SAY CHRISTMAS DAY ANYWAY -- SO THAT'S JUST. ONE THING TO KEEP IN TO KEEP IN MIND JUST FOR CONTEXT BUT IN GENERAL ARE OFFICE -- YOU KNOW pTHIS IS A BUT POLICY AT THE END OF THE DAY IT COMES DOWN TO THE PRIORITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE PRIORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE BUT WE DID. WE DO KNOW THAT IT WAS EIGHTY POLICY THAT WAS TAKEN DURING A RECESSIONARY TIME AND THAT WERE IN DIFFERENT TIMES NOW -- I ALSO WAS CURIOUS TO TAKE A LOOK AT WILL HOW MANY HOLIDAYS ARE OBSERVED BY STATE GOVERNMENT HOW MANY OR OBSERVE BY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IT'S TEN AND ELEVEN DAYS -- THEY'RE NOT AT FOURTEEN DAYS LIKE THIS POLICY YOU WOULD BE FOR THIS THE SERVICE PROVIDERS SO -- THE END OF THE DAY IT COMES DOWN TO I MEAN THERE WOULD BE A COST WITH REPEALING IT BUT YEAH. THANK YOU THANK COMES FINANCE. OKAY. SO JUST AGAIN I'D PUT ELIA SAID SO CLARIFIED THE THE HOLIDAY ISSUES REALLY -- FOR TWO DAISY SERVICES PROGRAMS NOT. LIKE THE RESIDENTIAL WHICH WOULD BE TWENTY IS THAT IT'S LIMITED TO LIMITED TO A CERTAIN TO CERTAIN SERVICE CATEGORIES AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY THERE AREN'T IT DOESN'T CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR SOME OF THOSE SERVICE CATEGORIES FOR EXAMPLE -- SOME HE IS EMPLOYMENT SERVICES ARE NOT INCLUDED FOR EXAMPLE BUT SOME PEOPLE GET THEIR JOB SUPPORT THREE DAY PROGRAMS. SO IF THEY HAVE THEIR JOB SUPPORT THREE DAY PROGRAM AND THEY'RE WORKING ON BLACK FRIDAY THE DAY AFTER THANKSGIVING AND THAT'S A REQUIRED HOLIDAYS THEY DON'T HAVE THE JOB SUPPORT ON THAT DAY. SO THERE THESE TRICKY NUANCES BUT I THINK THE REASON SOME OF THE I I MEAN I CAN'T SPEAK FOR ALL THE REGIONAL CENTERS BUT I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS THAT SOME OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS DID HAVE. A POLICIES LIKE SEVEN DAYS THEY PICKED THE DAYS THAT MOST OF THE SERVICE PROVIDERS WARRANT PROVIDING SERVICES ANYWAY OKAY OKAY [inaudible] THE ANYTHING I MEAN SO I A HEAR YOU TALK ABOUT THE CELL OF ANY ANY OF THE OPINIONS ABOUT THAT AND HIS IS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THAT. I THINK I THINK THAT'S WHAT I THINK I THINK WE'RE HEARING FOURTEEN SOUNDS A LITTLE ONE REASONABLE OBVIOUSLY RECESSIONARY MOVE -- BUT ALLOWING SOME. SOME DAYS MAY MAKE SENSE JUST BECAUSEDEL THAT'S FUNCTIONALLY WHAT REALLY IS HAPPENING AND OUT OF THE CAN YOU CAN YOU REIMBURSE FOR SOMETHING WE ARE NOT PROVIDING THE SERVICE ANYWAY SO IT SO I GUESS THAT'S I THINK WHAT'S I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT. TO POINT OUT HERE AND AND AND ONE OF THEM IS THAT WE'RE TOLD ON MANY OCCASIONS THAT THINGS ARE BUSINESS DECISION AND TRULY FOR ANY OTHER BUSINESS. WHAT HOLIDAYS YOU'RE CLOSED FOR IS A BUSINESS DECISION? IN IN OUR CASE THAT'S NOT TRUE IT'S IT'S NOT A BUSINESS DECISION IT'S WHAT WE'RE TOLD WE HAVE TO BE CLOSED IF WE WANT TO SUPPORT SOMEONE ON THAT DAY WE'RE NOT GONNA GET PAID FOR THAT. MEANING THAT THE PERSON THAT'S PROVIDING THAT SUPPORT WON'T GET PAID -- SO I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW TO AND AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT AND AND I APPRECIATE -- YOU SONNY AT THE SHARING F THAT YOU KNOW MOST PLACES THE STATE HOLIDAYS ARE. TEN THE THE THING THAT WE NEED TO ALWAYS REMEMBER IS THAT THOSE ARE PAID HOLIDAYS -- IT'S NOT PAID HOLIDAYS FOR OUR FOLKS TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE PROVIDING SUPPORT OUR DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS WHO WERE SO UNDER PAID AS IT IS. ARE ALSO NOW BEING FORCED TO HAVE DAYS OFF UNPAID. SO BUT IT'S THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER. OKAY. OKAY AND JUST TO AT AT ON WHAT YOU WERE ASKING -- IT REALLY APPRECIATE ELOISE COMMENTS -- THEY'RE VERY THOROUGH AND NO I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IS ASKING IN ADDITION BE ANY HOLIDAYS TAKEN THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE -- BUT AGAIN THAT FOURTEEN DAYS SEEMS TO BE EXCESSIVE IN ALL TO ME ARE JUST ASKING. FOR LOW'S FOR WORKERS OR FOR PROVIDERS TO HAVE TO EAT THAT COST -- IF THERE WERE SEVEN SOME REAL CENTERS IT SOUNDED LIKE THERE WAS A SURVEY OR SOMETHING TAKEN WERE SUMMER TAKEN SEPARATE SUMMER TAKING -- TEN I THINK WE CAN. LIKELY FIND A PLACE WHERE NOBODY WOULD COME TO AGREEMENT ON THAT OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THEN SO -- SO I HOPE THAT -- WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO WIN THIS THING -- THIS FOURTEEN DOES SEEM A BIT EXCESSIVE. AND THE SAID I THINK FUNCTIONALLY IT IS THAT DOES AT THAT POINT. SO LIKE A FORCE FOR LOW ARE ARE ARE IN PAID WORK. WELL FIRST FORCE FOR LOW SORTS SO. IT DOESN'T LINE UP WITH CERTAINLY WHAT STATE S. OF WORTH I THINK THERE IS A POINT I RECOGNIZE THAT YOU COULD SAY WELL EVEN AND EVEN THE BILL DOES SHOULD BE EVEN PAID HOLIDAYS -- BUT THAT'S A FURTHER DISCUSSION BUT AT LEAST I THINK -- LET'S IT SEEMS LAW AND REASONABLE TO BE -- ASKING TELLING THEY HAVE TO DO FOURTEEN AND WE DIDN'T REALLY TOUCHED -- THAT THE HALF THE BILLING ISSUE. AT THE THIS IS. SO USE. YEAH WE DON'T REALLY TALK ABOUT THAT SO. ON THE THEY HAVE TO BILLING -- MISTER CHAIR IS IN EFFECT IN THE CURRENT YEAR. ON AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TO KEEP IT IN FACT IN BUDGET YEAR. AND BASICALLY. ON WHAT THE HAVE THE BILLING ROOM THE SAVINGS ARE MINOR -- WE WERE ESTIMATING COST SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION TOTAL ONE TWENTY SIX GENERAL FUND. TO THEIR MINIMAL SAVINGS BUT WITH WHAT THE RULE DOES -- IS IT ON IT REQUIRES SPECIFIED PROGRAMS ACTIVITY CENTERS ADULT DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS BEHAVIOR MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. AND OTHER LOOKALIKE DAY PROGRAMS. TO THAT CHARGE A DAILY BILLING RATE. ON IT REQUIRES THAT. ACT CONSUMERS THEY'RE PARTICIPATING THESE PROGRAMS BE THERE AT LEAST 65%. OF THE DATA BILL. IF THERE IF THERE THERE'S LESS THAN THAT THEY HAVE TO BEHALF. TO ACT [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. OKAY THIS CHAIR FOR FREE ON ON THAT -- SO WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE FOR MINOR SAVINGS IS A VISITOR PROVIDER AND WHILE THE PREVIOUS YOU WERE GETTING PAID FOR A FULL DAY. NOW IN THE MINUTE SOMEBODY WALKS IN THE DOOR THROUGH TRANSPORTATION THAT'S BRINGING THEM TO A PROGRAM OR TO A DIFFERENT TYPE OF SERVICE FROM THE COMMUNITY. NOW THEY HAVE HAVE TO COMPLETELY CHANGE OUR ADMIN WHERE THEY ARE GET AN EXCEL SPREADSHEET BY TEN A. M. XIN KNOWING EXACTLY WHEN PEOPLE CAME IN. BY HOPES THAT THEY CAN GET THEM AND KEEP THEM THERE TO THE 65% SO THEY GET PAID THE FULL DAY WHAT MAN IS THAT BECAUSE THE TRANSPORTATION IS COMING. AND THE HONKING THE HORN CAN THE STATE HERE I MEAN THAT'S LITERALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND AS A RESULT. ALL RIGHT SO EGGS I GUESS ONE QUESTIONS IT POSES THAT -- RECOGNIZE THE THERE'S SOME SMALL SAVINGS BUT IT THE OVERHEAD COSTS FOR I MEAN IS IT THE OVERHEAD COSTS FOR THE FIVE WE'RE HEARING ABOUT THE OVERHEAD COSTS FOR THE PROVIDERS. DO YOU JUST DO PEOPLE AT THE DO YOU REVIEW AUDIT THEM ANYTHING LIKE THAT OR ANY AND AND IS ONE LIKE IS IT WORTH THE TROUBLE I GUESS. IN TERMS OF COST RIGHT WOULD WOULD POSE A COST ON THE PROVIDER'S AND WHAT CLASS IT'S IMPOSING ON THE AGENCY. AT SOME BILL IT WHETHER THAT THE COST OF ENFORCING IT IS GOING TO EXCEED THE COST OF THE SAVINGS I'D SELL. MISTER CHAIR AT THE AS FAR AS REVIEWS THAT RESPONSIBILITY AT THIS POINT IF THERE WAS GOING TO BE ANY KIND OF LOCAL MONITORING WOULD COME FROM THE REGIONAL CENTERS -- WHEN I TAKE A LOOK AT THE AUDITS THAT WE'VE DONE AS A DEPARTMENT ON -- ANY OF THE PROVIDERS I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY RECENT REVIEWS THAT HAS TO DO WITH REVIEWING ANY HALF DAY BILLING -- MIGHT HAVE TO GO BACK AND VERIFY THAT BUT THERE HASN'T BEEN AND AND AND NUMBER OF YEARS THE FOCUS OF OUR REVIEWS HAVE BEEN ON ON OTHER AREAS AND IT HAS NOT BEEN ON THAT. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL IT IS SO I GUESS WHAT CAUSES OPPOSES THAT. IF FOR DOING THIS IS IT REALLY IS THAT WHAT WORTH IT IN TERMS OF MONEY I'M A REJECT BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE IN TERMS OF THE OVERSIGHT AND SO FORTH AND WHAT. BURDENS IT PLACES ON THE PROVIDERS VERSES THE MOUSE SAVINGS WERE GETTING FROM THAT THAT BAG A SOON THERE'S A FEDERAL IMPERATIVE FOR US TO DO THIS. SO -- SO DOES THAT MAKE SENSE RIGHT IS THAT WE JUST IMPOSING IS THIS A SAVINGS REALLY WORTH THE COST. AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION IS IS THAT RELATED TO THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS [inaudible] THE DELF 65% IS A DEAL LOWER 2% MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO TO IT HERE TO THIS AND THEN THIS -- BUT I GUESS THE FIRST QUESTION REALLY ISN'T WORTH IT I GUESS THAT'S MY QUESTION GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF SAVINGS -- GETTING A SENSE OF WHAT DOES THAT INVOLVE WHAT DOES THAT REQUIRE OF THE PROVIDERS WHAT DOES REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT AND AND IS IT WORTH THE TROUBLE I GUESS. BECAUSE AT CERTAIN POINTS IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW JUST BUREAUCRATIC EFFICIENCY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO OPPOSE THIS FOR THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY. ARE IN THE END IF WE'RE TRULY GOING TO DO THIS AND AND FORCE IT IS IT END UP GOING TO COST MORE THAN WHAT WE'RE REALLY GOING TO SAVE [inaudible] YES. MR TERROR UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN THAT YOU'RE SHARING AN INTEREST WE'VE HAD NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PROVIDERS AND AND UNDERSTANDING THE CONCERN NOT ONLY OF THE HALF DAY BILLING AND THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY. THEY THEY DISCUSSIONS OFTEN KINDA GO TOGETHER -- SO WILL YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO HEAR THAT THE CONCERNS WE'VE HAD THE DISCUSSIONS -- AND I A A UNFORTUNATELY I'M AND IT'S WITHIN -- THE PROPOSALS THAT WE HAD OUR NOSES ARE CONTINUING TO MOVE FORWARD AS WE STATED OKAY ALL RIGHT AND THANK YOU KNOW I SO SO I JUST IMPOSE THAT I MEAN I TO A CERTAIN EXTENT I CAN UNDERSTAND PEOPLE SAYING WELL GEE IF YOU ONLY PROVIDED. HALF DAY OF SERVICE WHERE WE PAYING A FULL DAY -- ALTHOUGH THE 65% I GUESS YOU KNOW THE QUESTION ANDBUT I I THINK THERE'S ALSO THE PART ABOUT THE SAVINGS. THIS WAS A AND I GUESS A MINOR BECAUSE A LOT OF MONEY -- FOR PEOPLE BUT GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE SAVINGS IN THE NUMBER PEOPLE INVOLVED I JUST WONDER ABOUT WHETHER. HOW MUCH WORK IT WOULD TAKE TO TRULY DO THIS MAKES IT REALLY MEANINGFUL TO DO IT AT ALL EIGHT AND DOES STERN LESTER'S? YOU KNOW RAMPED IT. EFFORTS BY PEOPLE THE NOT RIGHTS SERVICES TO PEOPLE AND WELL SO THEY GET PAINFUL DAY BUT ONLY CAN DO HALF I'M GONNA GIVE BILL THEM DOWN THAT. BUT THAT'S NOT HAPPENING IN THE WHITE IS THAT THE IN WIDESPREAD WHICH I DON'T THINK IT IS YOU NOT RAISING CONCERN THEN I'M NOT SURE WHY WE'RE DOING THIS. SELL. IT AND I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT IT. THE SOMEBODY MIGHT GO HOME AFTER WORK ON A REST ANPING RATIO SO THE STAFF FOR NOT GOING HOME AND SO THE COSTS TO THE PROVIDER IS STILL THE SAME. I MEAN UNLESS YOU SEND THE STAFF HOME AND AGAIN WE SHOULDN'T BE TREATING OUR DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE ALREADY. YOU KNOW STRUGGLING BY SENDING A HOME BECAUSE SOMEBODY IT GOT WENT HOME EARLY. BUT I WILL POINT OUT THAT I THINK TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. NO I THINK MOST OF THE TAXPAYER PUBLIC SAYS WE ONLY PROVIDE HALF DAY OF SERVICE NO ARE WE PAYING FOR THE WHOLE THING BUT AT THE SAME TIME IS THAT I DON'T THINK. PEOPLE ARE REALLY INTO AND I I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING RIGHT. PEOPLE ARE SETTING UP THEIR DAY TO ONLY PROVIDE A QUOTE HALF DAY WHATEVER MONTH DOES SERVICE THEY REALLY ARE INTENDING TO PROVIDE A FULL DAY THERE MAY BE OTHER FACTORS ARE INVOLVED. BUT AND THEN ULTIMATELY WHETHER MAKES SENSE. TO TO TO DO THIS OR NOT SO OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO WE'LL LOOK AT THAT TOO OKAY -- ALL RIGHT THANKS RAMESH OKAY SO LET'S MOVE ON THE ISSUE NUMBER THREE SOCIAL RECREATION CAMP SERVICES I BELIEVE A PANEL FOR THIS AS WELL CAROLINE SELLOUT TOTAL ALLEN. TO MISPRONOUNCE THAT -- BOARD MEMBER DISABILITY VOICES UNITED AND PARENTS AND BETH BURKE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AUTISM SIDE CALIFORNIA ALSO FAMILY MEMBER WELCOME. CAN I ASK YOU. TO KEEP YOUR REMARKS TO THREE MINUTE OR LESS EACH. OKAY THANK YOU. SO. GOOD MORNING THIS IS MY DAUGHTER MYRCELLA SIDE YOU SHOULD SEE HER DANCING -- I'M CAROL INTO LAW IN AN APPARENT. AND A BOARD MEMBER OF DISABILITIES VOICES UNITED. BUT I'M NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT ME I'M HERE TO REPRESENT MY DAUGHTER HI SHOULD YOU PICTURE. IS NOT ABLE TO ARTICULATE. A WITH SOCIAL WORK MEANS TO HER I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT MY DAUGHTER MARISSA WHO'S THIRTY YEARS OLD. LIVES WITH HER TWO BEST FRIENDS AND A HOME THAT THEY RENT. AND HAVE SUPPORTS IN THEIR HOME. SHE ALSO HAPPENS HAVE DOWN SYNDROME. MY DAUGHTER'S GREATEST JOY AND HIGHLIGHTED PER WEEK IS DANCING SHE TENS AND TAKES DANCE CLASSES. THE BEARS AN INCLUSIVE SETTING IN FRESNO. CHOOSE ON THEIR DANCE TEAM AND TAKES HAVE POP. SHE DANCES THREE AND A HALF HOURS A WEEK. SOCIAL RECORDS NOT JUST A FRIVOLOUS EXTRA TO HER LIFE. THE BENEFIT OF DANCING FOR HER IS ABOUT EXERCISE INCLUSION WITH THOSE AND WITH AND WITHOUT DISABILITIES. BEING IN THE COMMUNITY MOVEMENT EXERCISE. AND FUN. MERCER DELIGHTS IN PERFORMING FOR OTHERS. THINK ABOUT WHAT YOUR LIFE WOULD MEAN WITHOUT SOMETHING YOU LOVE TO DO. EACH YEAR I SPENT ABOUT FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS TO FIND HER DANCING. SHE'S NOT ABLE TO FOR THIS ON HER OWN WHILE RECEIVING HER ONLY HER MONTHLY SSI CHECK. IF I COULD NOT AFFORD TO HELP OR SHOULD BE MISSING OUT ON WHEN THE GREATEST JOYS OF OUR LIFE. I WOULD NOT IF I WAS NOT ALIVE SHOULD BE MISSING OUT ALSO. THAT IS WHY I'VE FUNDING SOCIAL WRECK PROGRAMS MISSY FIND IT FOR HER AND HER FRIENDS AND FOR OTHERS LIKE HER. AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT DANCING IT'S ABOUT SUMMER CAMP HE JIM MASCOTS HORSEBACK RIDING MUSIC KARATE SWIMMING AND OTHER ACTIVITIES. FOR CHILDREN WITHOUT DISABILITIES THAT THEY TAKE THAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED. AND IS ALSO A ABOUT NON MEDICAL THERAPIES SUCH AS AT KLINE THERAPY MUSIC THERAPY WHICH HELPS SO MANY CHILDREN AND ADULTS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. WE KNOW THAT HISPANIC AFRICAN AMERICAN AND ASIAN PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES FACE THE SPERY'S AND WE SEE FEWER SERVICES THEN ONCE. WE BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE REASONS IS THAT THE LEGISLATIVE KEPT FUNDING FOR SOCIAL WORK PROGRAM SOMETHING THIS COMMUNITIES REALLY NEED. AND REALLY HAVE USE AFTER THESE PROGRAMS WERE CUT FAMILIES WITH THE FINANCIAL MEANS LIKE MINE JUST PAID. FOR THE SERVICES OUT OF THEIR POCKET FOR FOR CHILDREN FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES IS JUST ANOTHER WAY THAT THEY FACE THE SEVERITY. SO THEY'RE STAYING HOME AND THEY ARE NOT IN THE COMMUNITY AND THEY ARE MISSING OUT ON WHAT BRINGS SOME JOY IN THEIR LIVES. IT HAS BEEN TEN YEARS SINCE THE FUNDS WERE. SERVICES WERE FUNDED A WHOLE GENERATION OF CHILDREN HAVE GROWN UP. AND I'M NOT BEEN ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROGRAMS WHEN I TELL OTHER PARENTS ABOUT THIS IN A SUPPORT GROUP BY RANDY GO ARE YOU KIDDING ME YOU GOT TO DO THAT. GET HELP FOR HER TO GO TO HER CÃM.

THE AUTISM SOCIETY CONDUCTS A SURVEY EVERY OTHER YEAR NINE HOPEFULLY YOU'VE GOTEN YOUR COPY I'LL BE REFERENCING PAGE. TEN THIS YEAR OUR FOCUS WAS ON UNMET NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY. THE NUMBER ONE UNMET NEED FOR OUR FAMILIES AND ADULTS WAS SOCIAL SOCIAL RECREATION. PARTICIPATION AND INCLUSION AND SOCIAL RECREATION SERVICES INCLUDING ART MUSIC CULTURAL EVENTS AND CAMPING ARE IMPORTANT PART. MANY OF US HAVE FOND MEMORIES GROWING UP -- BEING ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE X. SERVICES OUR SURVEY REPORTS THAT THIS WAS THE MOST REQUESTED UNMET NEED ONE OUT OF THREE OF THE PARENTS OF CHILDREN AND ONE OUT OF FIVE ADULTS PUT SOCIAL RECREATION SERVICES HEAD OF ANY OTHER NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE. THE LACK OF SOCIAL ACCESS TO SOCIAL OPPORTUNITIES IS HAVING A DIRE CONSEQUENCE FOR BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS. AS ONE PARENT SEND OUR KIDS ARE DYING OF LONELINESS ISOLATION AND THE LACK OF ACCEPTANCE AND OPPORTUNITIES. THE AUTISM SOCIETY STRONGLY SUPPORTS REINSTATING THE SERVICES WE ALSO ASK FOR CONSIDERATION OF ONE TIME FINDING THAT WOULD ALLOW SERVICE PROVIDERS TO HIRE STAFF. THAT WOULD HAVE THE QUALIFICATIONS TO HELP OUR POPULATION. OUR SURVEY ALSO SHOWED THAT 25% OF OUR POPULATION HAS LITTLE OR NO LANGUAGE 40% HAS SEVERE BEHAVIORS. AND WE'RE REQUESTING THIS -- FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO TRAIN. THE STAFF TO BE ABLE TO SAFELY TAKE ARE ADULTS AND CHILDREN INTO THE COMMUNITY. THEY ARE GOING TO NEED A HIGHER LEVEL OF TRAINING BECAUSE OF THEIR COMPLEX NEEDS. BURNING MAKING FRIENDS AND PARTICIPATING RECREATION ARE PART OF A HEALTHY HUMAN EXPERIENCE IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS SINCE HE'S CRITICAL SERVICES WERE SUSPENDED.

AT A TIME THAT NO OTHER SERVICES ARE BEING CUT IN THE SAME WAY THERE IS NO REASON TO PUT THIS CUT FORWARD YOU CAN DELAY IT BY ONE YEAR WHAT WE HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT. IS IT APPROPRIATE TO HAVE UNIFORM HOLIDAY YOU YOU KNOW YOU'RE A FURLOUGH DAYS ACTUALLY -- AND BY THE WAY AND I JUST SAYS A FOR THE SAME TYPES OF REASONS IS NOT APPROPRIATE TO BE REDUCING SERVICES AT A TIME WHEN EVERYONE ELSE IS GETTING MORE RESOURCES LASTLY JUST WANT TO SAY. IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO REEXAMINE ITS POLICY REGARDING PAYING THE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE OR MINIMUM WAGE. TO SIMPLY STATING THAT THE POLICY IN THE PAST IS THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE IT IS NOT POLICY AND I THINK THE LEGISLATURE AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO LOOK AT WHAT SHOULD BE THE POLICY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REGARDING WHAT IS FAIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WELL GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME S BETSY KATE'S AND I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE ARK OF CALIFORNIA I ALSO HAVE A THIRTY SEVEN YEAR OLD SON WITH AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY -- AND I WANTED TO COMMENT ON THE UNIFORM HOLIDAYS HOLIDAY SCHEDULE IN THE HALF DAY BILLING. ARE THESE THINGS I WOULD CREATE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS AND UNCERTAINTY AND ANXIETY FOR SELF ADVOCATES AND THEIR FAMILIES SUCH AS MINE. FAMILIES HAVE TO SCRAMBLE TO FIND ALTERNATIVE CARE ON HOLIDAY CLOSURES IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF SCARCE RESOURCES. AND SELF ADVOCATES HAVE INTERRUPTIONS IN THEIR PROGRAM PARTICIPATION THAT DISSED WRAPPED THE SKILLS THAT THERE WERE -- TRYING TO LEARN -- THESE POLICIES WOULD A CREEK CREATE ADDITIONAL FISCAL PRESSURE FOR LOCAL COMMUNITY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THE UNDERMINE AND THREATEN THE CONTINUITY AND RELIABILITY OF THE SYSTEM WHICH IS VITAL TO THE WELL BEING. OF THE INDIVIDUALS WE SERVE THEREFORE WE OPPOSE THE REINSTATEMENT OF THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE AND WE SUPPORT ELIMINATION OF HALF DAY BILLING THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. HELLO MY NAME IS RAYMOND HANSON A PARENT OF A CHILD WITH THAT MULTIPLE INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. BOARD MEMBER TREASURER OF THE ARK A CALIFORNIA -- I SUPPORT THE ADVOCATES THE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE IN HALF A BILLING. I ALSO SUPPORT THE REINSTATEMENT SOCIAL RECREATION CAMP SERVICES CANCER IS SERVICES ARE VITAL COMPONENT. FOR BOTH THE PARENTS. OUR ADULT KIDS NEED THE RESPITE FROM THEIR PARENTS.

HELLO I'M JACQUI DILLARD FOSS WITH THE CALIFORNIA SUPPORTED LIVING NETWORK AND THE PATH FOR A COLLABORATIVE. YOU KNOW I WAS THINKING WHEN YOU SAID IS IT WORTH IT. WE GENERALLY WHENEVER SESSION HAPPENS WE ALL TAKE CUTS TOGETHER BUT WHEN RECOVERY HAPPENS WE ALL RECOVER TOGETHER AND I WAS WONDERING WHY IS IT THAT POPE FOLKS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ARE NOT PART OF THE RECOVERY. BECAUSE ALSO RECKON TEN USED TO BE CUT LIKE YOU SAID UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULES ARE PROPOSED THAT WAS DURING THE TIME OF A CUT. SO I JUST WONDER WHY DO WE NOT BE PART OF THE RECOVERY PROCESS IF CALIFORNIANS ON A ROAD TO RECOVERY ALLOW OUR SYSTEM TO RECOVER AS WELL. I ALSO WANT TO SAY ABOUT THE MINIMUM WAGE I WHEN I TALKED TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IT WAS FIFTY CENTS AT A TIME. I APPRECIATE THE MINIMUM WAGE FOR ENTRY LEVEL POSITIONS I DON'T HAVE ENTRY LEVEL WORKERS. YOU CAN CHANGE THE LAW TO TALK ABOUT WE ARE NOW DEALING WITH THE MOST SEVERE COMPACTION ISSUE WE SAY IT'S A BUSINESS DECISION THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CHOSE TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE WHAT YOU NEED TO CHOOSE. TO RAISE THE WAGE OF DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS BY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE IMPACT OF MINIMUM WAGES TO OUR INDUSTRY WERE NOT AN ENTRY LEVEL INDUSTRY OUR LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE PROVIDERS DESERVE BETTER WE NEED TO RAISE THE WAGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. IRWIN HOLDEN WITH EASTER SEAL -- ZERO CLEARLY GET ALL OF THE ISSUES AND WE CLEARLY APPRECIATE THE AUDIENCE FOR A HIGHLIGHTING THE ISSUES AS WELL AS AN BACK TOGETHER AND I ALSO ESPECIALLY APPRECIATE THE LA -- AS IT IS A LATE AT OUR ISSUE WITH -- STATE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE IT IS AND AND THAT COULD THEIR CONNECTION TO THE FEDERAL THANK STATE.

TO EACH ONE DIFFERENT OF OUR CHILDREN HAVING DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS AND AS WE'VE SEEN THIS WONDERFUL MOVING CHANGE IN MINDSET TO TRULY BE INDEPENDENT IN THE COMMUNITY. WE'VE ALSO EXPERIENCE THE LACK OF PROGRAMMING TO DO SO IN A WAY THAT PROVIDES LIESER SKILLS AND THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE WITH pPEERS AND WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY SUCH AS THE SOCIAL WRECK PROGRAMS IN THE CAMPS. SO I WANTED TO JUST OFFER OUR SUPPORT AS A FAMILY AND THE YOUNG ADULTS THAT AREN'T HERE TODAY I'M REPRESENTING THEM HOPEFULLY I MAKE THEM PROUD. I'M A TO TO THAT ONE TIME ASK AND THEN ALSO FOR THE REINSTATEMENT AND THE LAST THING I WOULD ADD TO IS THAT THERE ARE NO DAYS OFF FROM LIVING ON THE SPECTRUM.

WORK LAST YEAR AND PUTTING THAT THE ISSUE FORWARD IN SUPPORT OF RESTORATION OF THOSE OKAY THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU. WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER. MISTER CHAIR -- CENTER HURTADO VERY JUTTING CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SERVICES THE STATION TALKING I WANT TO SPEAK ON THREE ISSUES NOT TRY TO DO QUICKLY FIRST ONE AND LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE FIX CERTAINLY WANT TO SUPPORT ANYTHING TO START ADDRESSING THAT PROBLEM IT'S IT'S CURRENTLY UNFAIR SIGNIFICANTLY FOR A LOT OF PROVIDERS IN THIS. HIGH COST AREAS IT ALSO HAS KNOCK ON EFFECTS FOR THE SURROUNDING AREAS AND EVERYTHING SO FINDING SOME WAY TO MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS IS CRITICAL -- AS WANT TO ADDRESS A POINT I KNOW THAT MISS BARTON MENTIONED DIRECT ABOUT TO MENTION THAT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVER PROCESS IS AN OPTION TO SELECT AT TO SOLVE THIS. BUT IT'S REALLY NOT BECAUSE THAT'S AN INDIVIDUAL BY INDIVIDUAL PROCESS AND IS NO LONGER BEING ALLOWED TO BE USED TO ADJUST FOR LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE FOR AN AGENCY SO WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A FIX WE DO NEED THE LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION WORK TOGETHER TO SUPPORT THAT. ON THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION THAT YOU HAD I I THINK EVERYONE'S GOING TO COVER THE WHAT THE IMPACT IS TO FAMILY MEMBERS STAFF AND CONSUMERS I WANT TO TOUCH ON THAT THE CONVERSATION YOU'RE HAVING ABOUT WHAT THE CORRECT BUDGET NUMBER IS. AND WHAT WHAT THE HOW MANY DAYS WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW I I JUST SAW THE ESTIMATE THAT WAS SENT TO LA -- THAT INDICATES THEY ARE EXPECTING IT TO FUND SIX DAYS -- THAT THAT FIFTY MILLION COVER SIX DAYS OF CLOSURES. WE DID A POLL OF OUR PROVIDERS ALMOST. ALMOST UNIMOG UNIFORMLY WE'RE LOOKING AT TEN AT TEN HOLIDAY SO -- WE THINK THAT THAT BUDGT NUMBERS WRONG ON THE HALF DAY I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON THE PIECE ABOUT WE WE TALK ABOUT 65% I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT THE OTHER PIECE OF IT IS THAT THERE IS NO ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENT TO TRACK TIME AT THIS POINT SO WHEN IT WENT BACK INTO AFFECT PROVIDERS HAD TO COME UP WITH SYSTEMS TO TRACK THAT TIME. IT WASN'T REQUIRED REGULATIONS THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU WELCOME. CLOSER FEATURES EXPLORED -- AGAIN I THINK ICE RISES YOU KNOW SUPPORT OF WAY TO FIX. OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONALS. THE SUPPRESSION OF THE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE HAS EXACERBATED THAT WE ARE NOW A MINIMUM WAGE -- SYSTEM OR GETTING CLOSE TO IT AND THE NEXT YEARS AS THAT WAS MINIMUM WAGE GOES A FIFTEEN DOLLARS THE BUDGET NUMBER NEED TO GO UP SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE MORE MORE AGENCIES THIS YEAR I HAD FOUR PEOPLE WHO WOULD DO THAT. NEXT YEAR I'LL PROBABLY HAVE CLOSER TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY STAFF WHO POTENTIALLY WOULD QUALIFY FOR THAT INCREASE. THAT NUMBER'S GONNA SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES THE AS THAT INCREASES ONE OBVIOUSLY THE HOLIDAY SCHEDULE IS A CHALLENGE. ALSO THE HAVE TO FULLY BILLING HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT -- WHILE THE STATE HAS BUDGETED SLIGHT DOLLARS I'M WILLING TO ACCEPT THEIR BUDGET THEY'RE SAVING SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ON THE BACKS OF CHOICE. COMMUNITY OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE A THREE ONE RATIO IF ONE PERSON GOES HOME EARLY TO THE OTHER TO HAVE TO GO HOME EARLY SO I CAN SEND THE STAFF HOME. DOESN'T HAPPEN. WE SUPPORT CHOICE TO GO AND DO THAT. WE ALSO BELIEVE IN LIVE WORK PLAY. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY SUPPORT SOCIAL RECREATION. PEOPLE THAN TO PLAY FALLOUT OF EMPLOYMENT AS WE TALK TO DR. PEOPLE NEED SOCIAL RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR CARING FOR THIS MISTAKE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES RISING TO SPEAK ON ISSUE NUMBER THREE AMONG THOSE PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS WHO CAN REMEMBER SESSION REX SERVICES. THEY ARE AMONG THE MOST VALUE TO CHERISH SOUGHT AFTER AND DESIRED SERVICES AGAIN -- NOW IS THE RIGHT TIME TO RESTORE THEM ESPECIALLY SELF DETERMINATION RULING OUT -- THAT ADDS UP TERMINATION HAPPENS THOSE REGIONAL CENTER CLIENTS WERE EITHER IN TRADITIONAL SERVICES FOR SELF DETERMINATION WILL BE WITH ACCESS SOCIAL WRECK IN THE SAME EQUAL WEIGH. IN UNCOMPLICATED STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY BY YOUR RESTORATION OF THEM OF THE COUNCIL'S EXPERIENCE ECHOES WHAT THE DEPARTMENT IS EXPERIENCED AS IT RELATES TO THOSE WHO WANT THIS MORE THOSE WERE ALREADY EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES. SO THERE IS AN EQUITY ISSUE THAT WE WOULD SEE ALSO IN RESTORING THIS IS CUT THE COUNCIL THINKS THIS COMMITTEE'S SUPPORT OF THIS ISSUE IN THE PAST AND ALSO -- FUTURE SUPPORT NOT ONLY IN A ONE TIME AN ON GOING BASIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. NANCY CHANCE UP FAMILY MEMBER. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CHOICES PERSON CENTERED SERVICES CALIFORNIA DISABILITY COMMUNITY ACTION NETWORK AND PATH FOR COLD COLLABORATION OKAY GET OUT OF THE WAY -- I AM I I WANT TO ECHO WHAT WAS SAID ABOUT THE MINIMUM WAGE ON THE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE. MY AGENCIES WORKED HARD TO STAY AHEAD OF THE MINIMUM WAGE IN ORDER TO PROMOTE THE THAT THAT PEOPLE ARE VALUED AND WELL WE'RE NO LONGER THERE WERE A WERE A MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYER NOW AND BUT LIKE NEVER RECEIVED ANY INCREASE EXCEPT FOR MY OVERNIGHT SLEEP RATE. AT AT ALL BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AHEAD OF THE MINIMUM WEIGHT SO I CAN'T GET IT I HAVE TO WAIT TO A MINIMUM AGE BRIGHTER THE OTHER THING I WANT TO ADD TO THAT IS THAT -- IN THIS STATE YOUR HERE WERE EXEMPT EMPLOYEES NEED TO BE MAKING DOUBLE THE MINIMUM WAGE AND THAT JUST KEEPS GOING UP AND GOING UP ANDWE ARE NOT COMPENSATED FOR THAT IN ANY WAY BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE EXEMPT EMPLOYEES NAY DESERVE THAT WAGE. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT I SUPPORT -- A REINSTATEMENT OF SOCIAL RACK AND CAMPS I THINK THAT'S GOT TO BE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO PEOPLE IN OUR IN OUR FIELD AND SO. I SUPPORT THAT I HOPE YOU'LL TAKE THAT CONSIDERATION THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. HI MY NAME'S RON A LOG EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR CREEL COMMUNITY RESOURCE FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING AND ALSO THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR THE DD COUNCIL FOR ALAMEDA COUNTY. I ECHO AND SUPPORT WHAT EVERYBODY'S BEEN SAYING -- ESPECIALLY WITH SOCIAL RECREATION IT'S BEEN SUCH A VITAL PART I BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINE WE WERE RUNNING A PROGRAM AND ONE THAT GOT CUT. THESE GUYS HAD NOTHING LEFT AND SO IT'S SO IMPORTANT MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT WORK LIFE BALANCE AND BY HAVING THIS IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE THAT AGAIN -- AND THEN I ECHO WITH THE THE MINIMUM WAGE -- THE COMPRESSION BETWEEN EXEMPT EMPLOYEES AND REGULAR THAN REGULAR STANDARD EMPLOYEES WE WANT TO PROFESSIONALISM THIS THIS INDUSTRY AND IT'S NOT WE HAVE TO BRING THOSE RATES UP. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. WELCOME. HI THANK YOU ARE DONNA FUNGAL THE DIRECTOR OF ADAPTIVE LEARNING CENTER -- ONCE AGAIN ECHOING WITH EVERYONE SAYING -- I THINK THE REINSTATEMENT OF THE FOURTEEN HOLIDAYS IS IS REALLY INSULTING IN A TIME OF PROSPERITY WHEN IT WAS A CUT AND IT'S VERY DISAPPOINTING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE TO SPEND ENERGY ON THIS ISSUE. BUT I REALLY WANT TO ADDRESS THE MINIMUM WAGE ISSUE I KNOW WILL BE DISCUSSED EVEN MORE NEXT WEEK I APPRECIATE -- TRYING TO FIX THE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE PROBLEM IT IS KIND OF RIDICULOUS WHAT THE HOOPS PEOPLE HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH BUT IT SADDENS ME GREATLY SADDENS ME THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR WORK FORCE. THESE ARE NOT MINIMUM WAGE JOBS THERE A LOT. A LOT OF JOBS THAT ARE EASIER THAT REQUIRE A LOT LESS SKILL THAT PEOPLE CAN BE MAKING THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY. AND THE FOLKS WE SUPPORT DESERVE. TO HAVE A SKILLED PROFESSIONAL LIES WORKFORCE AND IF IT WAS YOUR FAMILY MEMBER THAT IS WHAT YOU WOULD WANT SO I HOPE THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT THE MINIMUM WAGES BECAUSE WE'RE MAKING SO MUCH MORE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WELCOME I AM PADDY ANGER FROM PATH POINT -- WE SERVE TWO THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND WE PROVIDE SERVICES IN FIVE COUNTIES THROUGH CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- I'D LIKE TO COMMENT ON THE UNIFORMS CLOSURE DAYS. AND WE ARE A SYSTEM IN CRISIS I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND THE MAIN REASON. IS BECAUSE WE CANNOT ATTRACT STAFF AT THE WAGE WE CAN PAY THEM. FISCAL THESE CLOSURE DAYS INTO FACT. BECAUSE FOR AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT SIX REDUCTION IN REVENUE. WE CAN'T CUT OUR COSTS ANYWHERE ELSE EXCEPT UNFORTUNATELY STAFF WAGES. MOST OF OUR COST OUR STAFF WAGES THAT ONE POINT SIX REALLY BECOMES ABOUT 2% SO IT SEEMS VERY CONTRADICTORY. TO CUT STAFF WAGES 2% WHEN WE HAVE A SYSTEM IN CRISIS. PRIMARILY BECAUSE STAFF WAGES ARE TOO LOW. WE HAVE TO SEND PEOPLE HOME REGULARLY BECAUSE WE HAVE FORTY OPENINGS IN OUR ORGANIZATION. SO IT'S IT'S A BIG PROBLEM THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO COMMENT ON WAS THE MINIMUM WAGE. AND IT FELT LIKE IF THE DISCUSSION WAS AROUND. OUR INDUSTRY BEING A MINIMUM WAGE INDUSTRY IT'S NOT. AND WE HAVE THAT STILL SORRY WE HAVE SKILLED PEOPLE WE NEED TO THINK OF IT AS A MUCH HIGHER THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE INDUSTRY WE HAVE NEVER ONCE APPLIED FOR THE MINIMUM WAGE ADJUSTMENT. NOT BECAUSE OF LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE BUT BECAUSE WE CAN'T PAY ANYBODY MINIMAL WHICH WE HAVE TO PAY MORE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. WELCOME A GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY MY NAME IS MARIA MOBERG I'M HERE AS A MOTHER OF A SEVEN DIAGNOSED WITH CEREBRAL PALSY I'M HERE IS THE SISTER OF A FIFTY YEAR OLD BROTHER WITH AUTISM.

IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE SIR FORTY THREE THOUSAND PLUS A YOUNG CHILDREN BIRTH TO THREE WITH THIS AT RISK FOR DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS OR WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN I LOST FIVE TEACHERS BECAUSE OF OUR INABILITY TO PAY A WAGE THAT THEY NEEDED TO BE PAID AT THAT TIME. ON JULY WHEN WE ARE FACING THE POSSIBLE RE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE IN OUR AGENCY OF MILK IT WILL MEAN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PLUS CUT TO WORK OUT TO OUR REVENUES. WE DO NOT HAVE THAT FUNDING TO SUPPORT THAT CUT. BUT BEYOND THAT IT'S GOING TO BE THE IMPACT TO OUR STAFF THESE ARE NOT PAID HOLIDAYS SENATOR PAN I SUPPORT THE STATEMENT THAT YOU MADE EARLIER MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER. THESE BECOMING PAID HOLIDAYS IF THE STATE CHOOSES. TO REINSTITUTE THAT THE PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO SOMEHOW PROVIDE US WITH FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE TEACHERS IN OUR PROGRAM WHO SUPPORT CHILDREN IN OUR STATE AT A TIME. IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT WHEN OUR SERVICES HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT ON THEIR DEVELOPMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY MY NAME IS AS AN ADULT Là IS THAT LOCAL MISS I AM I WAS VERY EXCITED I FLEW HERE YESTERDAY BECAUSE THAT HE WON IN THIS OPPORTUNITY I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS HERE SO HERE I AM.

AND WITH THAT. I WANT TO SAY TO DATE I IT'S WORKING WITH THE CHILDREN FROM FIRST TO THREE YEARS OF AGE IT'S A VERY AS YOU WOULD AGREE VERY CRITICAL COMPONENT. AND INTERRUPTIONS IN THEIR CONSISTENCY WARRANTS A NEGATIVE EFFECT NOT TO MENTION THE FORCED IMPACT ON THE FURLOUGH DAYS. AND JUST TO SUMMARIZE IT I KNOW THE GOVERNOR IS INVOLVED WITH HEAD START AND ALL THAT GREAT STUFF YOU AS WELL SO GIVEN THE PRIORITIES OF THE STATE. THE CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES AN START MUST ALSO BE A PRIORITY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME.

THE SAME NUMBER PEOPLE ANYMORE WE'RE GONNA HAVE A ROTATING SCHEDULE SENDING PEOPLE HOME BECAUSE WE CAN'T HIRE STAFF. WAS RE VACANCIES BETTER CAN'T PAY PEOPLE ENOUGH AND SO THAT BRINGS INTO QUESTION THE REAL WEATHER WERE REALLY IMPACT AND DURING THE LANTERN PROMISE. ON HOLIDAYS OTHERS A COMMENT THAT IT DOESN'T AFFECT RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS BUT IN OUR CASE IT DOES BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE CAN'T COME TOWARD A PROGRAM THEY HAVE TO GO STATE THE RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM. THE LAST POINT ON HALF DAY BILLING NOT ECHOING SOMETHING WILL SAID WHEN WE HAVE THREE PEOPLE IN A GROUP AND ONE OF THEM GOES HOME. OUR OUR ONLY OPTION IS GOING TO BECOME WE HAVE TO SEND THE OTHER TWO PEOPLE HOME AND THE STAFF MEMBER HAVE TO BILLING ISN'T A BIG CUT FOR THE STATE FOR US TO CUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS YEAR. MY LAST POINT ON THAT IS THAT THE QUESTION ABOUT -- WHAT IS THE PUBLIC THINKING THAT IF YOU THINK ABOUT PUBLIC SCHOOL FUNDING THEY DON'T CUT PUBLIC SCHOOL FUNDING WHEN KIDS GO HOME SICK AND AT UNDERSTAND WHY WE WERE CUT FUNDING FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHEN THEY GET SICK AND HAVE TO LEAVE EARLY?

TWO THOUSAND NINE I DUG IT OUT IN HIS SWIM CLASS THAT WAS NO LONGER FIND DEAD HE'S NOW TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD. SO -- I IT THIS WAS A REALLY IMPORTANT TIME FOR HIM TO BE ABLE TO BE IN A GREAT SWIM PROGRAM INTENT LEARN WATER SAFETY. ON BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE TWO ADDITIONAL POINTS BECAUSE SO MANY THESE PARENTS WERE SO PERSUASIVE -- AS THE PRESIDENT DISABILITY VOICES UNITED WE WANT TO ASK TO ADDITIONAL THINGS -- FIRST OF ALL -- I A POINT THAT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE WAS VERY GENEROUS AND RESTORED. OR REMOVE THE CAP ON RESPITE I'M I KNOW THAT IT WAS A TOUGH CHOICE BETWEEN RESPITE SOCIAL RECORD THE TIME. AND I THE LEGISLATURE I'M AND THE GOVERNOR READ THE CHOICE OF OF RESPITE WE IN OUR WE HAVEN'T DONE A FULL STUDY BUT WE IN OUR ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE RESPITE HAS ACTUALLY NOT REALLY BENEFITED. THE COMMUNITIES AND LIKE WE THOUGHT THEY WHAT -- WHILE THE CAP WAS LIFTED PEOPLE ARE NOT ACTUALLY GETTING A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN A RESPITE SO IT HASN'T HAD A MAJOR BENEFIT. SOCIAL WRAPPED IT WILL HAVE THAT BENEFIT THERE'S NO OTHER OPTION THE SECOND POINT I WANTED TO MAKE IS THAT -- WE ALSO REALLY ASK THE LEGISLATURE TO LOOK AT RESTORING NON MEDICAL THERAPIES IT'S A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT VERY NARROW GROUP OF OF THERAPIES. BUT WHAT IT INCLUDES ARE THINGS LIKE ECHOING THERAPY SO INSTEAD OF JUST GOING ON HORSEBACK RIDING YOU'RE ACTUALLY GETTING THERAPEUTIC IMPLIED. I'M ABLE ALSO INCLUDES THINGS LIKE NEUROLOGIC MUSIC THERAPY WHICH HAS BEEN GREATLY BENEFITED MY SON SO -- I HOPE THAT YOU'LL CONSIDER THAT AS WELL THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH. PEOPLE ALWAYS MADE COMMENTS IN WRITING TO SELL THANK YOU. WELCOME HI I'M DORIAN TANAKA MARIN VENTURES AND ALSO APPARENT. I'M TOWARD THE END OF A PRETTY LONG LINE HERE WHICH I THINK SPEAKS TOWARD THE IMPORTANT STUFF AND THE EYES ON THE ISSUES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. IN MY JOB I'M COMMUNITY SERVICES DIRECTOR I'M REALLY WORKING TO INCREASE THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT FOR THOSE WE SERVE. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO WHEN WE HAVE TROUBLE JUST RETAINING STAFF -- AND THE ADDITIONAL FURLOUGH DAYS WILL JUST MAKE THAT. AND EVEN MORE DIFFICULT SITUATION. AS A PARENT I AM A PARENT OF A KID WHO IS. G. JR REGIONAL CENTER ELIGIBLE AND THE WORD ELIGIBLE IS KEY HERE BECAUSE WE REALLY CAN'T USE THE SERVICES WE ARE ELIGIBLE -- FOR BECAUSE OF THE RATES WE HAVEN'T FOUND SOMEONE WHO IS WILLING TO DO RESPITE -- FOR THAT PAY. ON THE OTHER HAND MY SON. DOES ALL KINDS OF SOCIAL AND CAMP ACTIVITIES HE DOES HAVE POP DANCE HE DOES MARTIAL ARTS SEASON CAMP ALL SUMMER. SO IF WE COULD HAVE BENEFITTED FROM THAT WE WOULD BE GETTING SOMETHING THANK YOU THANK YOU. WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. CENTER HURTADO FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND HEARING A BUDDY. OF MINE IS CARL LUNDEN AMIR REPRESENT THE ALLIANCE SUPPORTING PEOPLE WITH ADD. A VERY BRIEF COMMENT -- AN ECHO WHAT YOU'VE HEARD THUS FAR RELATIVE TO THE MINIMUM WAGE ISSUE AND ITEMS TWO AND THREE I JUST LIKE TO ADD THAT IT JUST. FEELS BORDERLINE DISINGENUOUS TO HAVE TO MAKE A PITCH ON THIS YEAR AFTER YEAR ON A RECESSION ERA CUT. THAT STILL LINGERS IN THE SITUATION AFFECTS PEOPLE THE WAY DOES IT FEELS LIKE. WE'RE BEING PUT IN A POSITION NEGOTIATE FOR THIS ITEM. WHILE WE CAN'T EVEN GET TO THE REAL ITEMS OR TALK ABOUT WHICH I KNEW OR ON THE AGENDA NEXT WEEK. BUT IT FEELS LIKE A BARRIER TO GET TO THOSE ITEMS AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE TO BE IN THIS POSITION THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER TERRY COMMITTEE MEMBERS THERESA ANDERSON ON BEHALF OF THE PARKING NIGHT CIRCLE POLICY CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION I KNOW YOU KNOW OUR POSITION ON UNIFORM HOLIDAY IN HALF DAYS MISTER LINDSEY POINTED OUT EARLIER ON THE PANEL SO -- I DON'T NEED TO GOING TO THAT BUT WE WOULD ALSO LIKE -- TO REALLY STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF FIXING THE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE ISSUE AS WELL AS RESTORING SOCIAL WORK IN CAMP. THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN POUND AND THANK YOU SENATOR HER TOTAL FOR LISTENING TO US TODAY I'M HEATHER FLORA'S I'M THE DIRECTOR FOR CENTRAL VALLEY REGIONAL CENTER I COVER SENATOR HEARD HOW DOES DISTRICT -- I JUST WANTED TO BRING UP A COUPLE ITEMS I HADN'T HEARD YET TODAY ON ISSUE -- TO IN OUR AREA WE HAVE A HIGH LEVEL OF POVERTY AND WHEN FAMILIES HAVE TO TAKE THE TIME OFF TO COVER -- FOR THE CARE DURING THOSE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULES IT CAN HAVE DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES ON THOSE FAMILIES. SO I WANTED TO MAKE THAT POINT ADDITIONALLY WHICH IT WITH ISSUE THREE OF THE SOCIAL RECKON CAMP WERE TAKEN AWAY SO LONG AGO IT'S HARD TO REMEMBER ALL OF THE BENEFITS BUT WITH SOCIAL RECKON PARTICULAR AND SPECIALIZED THERAPEUTIC SERVICES THERE WERE EXTRAORDINARY HEALTH BENEFITS FOR THE INDIVIDUALS WE SERVED. IT HELP PEOPLE MAINTAIN AND REDUCE WEIGHT -- AND THAT ADDRESSES YOUR ISSUES OF CONTRACTURE AND ALL THESE OTHER SORTS OF THINGS -- THAT IMPACT THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. FINALLY WITH CAMP CAMP WAS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR RESPITE FOR A LOT OF OUR FAMILIES ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILD.

GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS MY NAME IS DAVID MULTI I'M REPRESENTING THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES COMMITTEE -- AND I'M SPEAKING INTO ANY OTHER HAVE CONTENT IN SUPPORT OF THE REMOVAL OF THESE RECESSIONARY.

UP DO THAT DEAL FOR EVERYTHING ELSE I WANT TO FOCUS ON THAT THE QUIRK THAT -- MINIMUM WAGE QUIRK UNFORTUNATELY THE MINIMUM WAGE QUIRK SOLVING THAT COMES DOWN. TO HOW WE'RE GOING TO FILL OUT A FORM. AND SO. WE CAN HAVE ALL THE LINE LANGUAGE THAT WE WANT IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT IF THE FORM IS NOT FIXED. WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUFFER. SO WHEN WE FILL OUT THE FORM WE PUT IN WHAT WE PAY A WORKER AND WHAT THE MINIMUM WAGES AND WE GET THE DELTA. RIGHT -- THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE. WHEN THERE IS A LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE? IN IN THAT AREA THE FIX FOR THE FORM NEEDS TO BE. IF THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE GOES UP X. YOU GET X. PLUS 23% FOR BENEFITS IT'S THAT SIMPLE. AND UNLESS BUT UNLESS THAT HAPPENS. THE NOTHING WILL CHANGE AND PEOPLE BE CONTINUE TO PAY THE MINIMUM WAGE. AT A HIGHER RATE AND THEN GO TO FILL OUT THE FORM AND NOT GET ANYTHING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME.

WHO COMES OVER IN PLACE WHAT HE DOES NOT HAVE A PLACE TO GO OUT AND?

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I WANTED TO JUST MAKE NOTE IN THE AGENDA IT'S A VERY NICE DESCRIPTION STAFF DID A WONDERFUL JOB IN PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW AND AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS TO YOU TODAY. SO IN THE AGENDA ON PAGE TWENTY IT DOES APPROPRIATELY NOTE THAT WE'RE REQUESTING -- EIGHT POINT ONE MILLION IN TOTAL FUNDS THAT WOULD BE SIX POINT FIVE MILLION IN GENERAL FUND FOR A SUPPORT OF A REORGANIZATION WITHIN OUR HEADQUARTERS OFFICE -- AS I NOTED EARLIER IN IN THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING -- OVER THE MANY YEARS IS THAT WE REALLY HAVE STARTED SEEN A SHIFT AS FAR AS SERVICES. I'VE INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA AND THE GROWTH WITHIN OUR SERVICES SO ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS CURRENTLY WE'RE PROJECTING CLOSE TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND THE NEXT YEAR -- AND AS I SAID NOTED EARLIER -- IN IN ISSUE ONE THAT THE GROWTH THAT WERE SEEN IS IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT IN ADDITION I GUESS I'D LIKE TO ALSO NOT JUST TALK ABOUT THE GROWTH THE CONSUMER POPULATION BUT ALSO JUST THE CHANGES OF OF THE SERVICES. AND I'LL I'LL EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY THAT'S NOTABLE AS FAR AS THE SUPPORTS THAT WE PROVIDE AS A DEPARTMENT -- TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE -- BUT IF YOU'LL BEAR WITH ME FOR JUST A SECOND I'D LIKE TO JUST GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF SOME OF THE CHANGES OF OUR SYSTEM. SO AS I NOTED EARLIER IN -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE HAD APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED THIRTY TWO THOUSAND CONSUMERS THAT WE WERE PROVIDING SERVICES FOR IN CALIFORNIA. AND IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THAT WENT TO TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND AND AS I NOTED THAT GOING INTO THE NEXT YEAR WE'RE LOOKING AT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AS WE HAVE HEARD YOU KNOW FROM MANY FAMILIES TODAY AND AS WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH FAMILIES ONE OF THE MOST. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT WERE SEEN IN OUR SYSTEM IS A GROWTH AND CHILDREN -- WITH AUTISM AND THOSE CHILDREN ARE ALSO AGING AND GETTING OLDER AND THE NEEDS OF OUR SYSTEM IS CERTAINLY CHANGING AS A RESULT. OF NOTE TO OUR TOTAL POPULATION CURRENTLY FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH AUTISM IS A HUNDRED TWELVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. OF THIS POPULAR AN 80% OF THEM ARE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY TWO JUST TO DRIVE INTO A LITTLE BIT DEEPER IS THAT WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT OUR POPULATION. BETWEEN THE AGE OF BETWEEN THREE AND 2160% OF THEM HAVE A DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM -- MOST NOTABLY IT'S RIGHT AROUND THE AGE OF SIX TO NINE YEARS OLD AND SO AGAIN. WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE CHANGES OF OUR DEMOGRAPHICS AS FAR AS ETHNICITY OF OUR POPULATION? SO WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR HISPANIC POPULATION IN -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IT REPRESENTED 34% OF OUR POPULATION -- CONSUMER POPULATION WHERE AS WHITES WAS AND CURRENTLY ARE HISPANIC POPULATION NOW REPRESENTS 39% WHERE WHITES IS 31%. SO WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT ALSO OUR AGING POPULATION THAT IS ALSO CHANGING. WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT OUR HEADQUARTERS? WE ARE A SYSTEM THAT HAS CHANGED WHAT I'M LOOKING AT HOW WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES IT WITH A TARGETED -- FOCUS AND PRIORITY OF NOT ONLY ON DELIVERING THE SERVICES THROUGH THE REGIONAL CENTERS. MAKING SURE THAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND OUR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM IS DELIVERING WITHIN THE LETTERMAN ACT WE WANT TO FOCUS ON THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF OUR SERVICE DELIVERY WE WANT TO FOCUS ON ENHANCING THE TRANSPARENCY STORE FAMILIES CAN. SEE KIND OF WHAT THE SERVICES ARE AND ALSO START MOVING THE NEEDLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW CAN WE MOVE THINGS TO A STANDARDIZED STATEWIDE APPROACH. SO WE CAN REALLY MAKE SURE THAT AS FAMILIES ARE HAVING EXPERIENCES WITHIN ONE REGIONAL CENTER CATCHMENT AREA. THAT THOSE EXPERIENCES COULD BE FOUND IN ANOTHER AREA HOW DO WE DO THAT ONE OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO IS A A DEPARTMENT IS ALSO BE RESPONSIVE TO THOSE NEEDS -- RIGHT NOW WE HAVE FOUR LAYERS ON THAT WORK WITH THE TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS -- THE PROPOSAL WOULD INCREASE THAT OUR RELATIONSHIP TO WHERE WE WOULD HAVE SEVEN TEAMS THAT WOULD WORK WITH A DIFFERENT REGIONAL CENTERS SO WE WOULD NOW HAVE -- ONE LAY IS ON WITH SUPPORT THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THREE REGIONAL CENTERS. ONE THING THAT IS VERY NOTABLE I THINK IN THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE FOR A REORGANIZATION IS REALLY HAVING A PRESENCE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ALSO AND IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO WHAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO OVER TIME IS TO BE HAD ABLE TO HAVE BETWEEN FORTY FIVE AND FIFTY OF OUR STAFF IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ATTEND. ANY OF THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITY MEETINGS WELL IN THE LAST YEAR WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE ABOUT THIRTY DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS REALLY BENEFICIAL WAS THAT WE DID HAVE STAFF THAT ATTENDED. AT LEAST ONE OF THE OF THE PUBLIC MEETINGS AT EACH REGIONAL CENTER HAD TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE DISPARITY ISSUES. YOU KNOW THEY WERE ABLE TO ATTEND. ONE IF WE HAD A PRESENCE THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN INCREASED ARE STOCKING WE WOULD BE ABLE TO ATTEND MORE THE COMMUNITY MEETINGS. NOT TO GET IN THE WAY OF WHAT THE WORK IS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT OUR INTENT. BUT WE CAN REALLY START TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE ISUES THAT WE'RE HEARING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TIE THAT BACK UP TO THE POLICY AND INITIATIVES THAT WERE DOING AT THE STATE LEVEL. AS AN EXAMPLE WHEN WE WERE -- DISBURSING ELEVEN MILLION FOR DISPARITY FUNDS OR WITH THE FIFTEEN MILLION THAT WE HAVE. FOR THE H. CBS -- COMPLIANCE FUNDING WHEN WE HAVE COMMUNITY PLACEMENT FUNDS AS WELL AS COMMUNITY RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT FUNDS ALL OF THAT THE DECISIONS THAT WERE MAKING FOR ALL OF THEM VESTMENT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS DOING. REALLY CAN'T BE TIED TO UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS I THINK IS IS REALLY CRITICAL IN BEING ABLE TO BE RESPONSIVE ONE OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE A WANTED TO DO WAS IMPROVE OUR RESPONSES TO INFORMAL COMPLAINTS TO FAMILIES -- AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE A PRESENCE BROADER THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA -- OUR RESPONSE TO BEING ABLE TO GET OUT WE HAD A A CONCERN THAT WAS SHARED IN A PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC AREA. IT WAS A IMPORTANT CONCERN IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY WANTED TO HEAR FROM THE FAMILIES IT WAS A PARTICULAR CONCERN TO AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER. YOU KNOW BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THERE IS USED THE FAMILIES WERE SAYING THAT THEY WERE NOT GETTING SERVICES WE NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE ISSUES WERE. IT TOOK US SEVERAL MONTHS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOMEBODY WITH AN HEADQUARTERS TO GO OUT AND BE THERE TO LISTEN TO WHAT THOSE CONCERNS WERE SO WE CAN PROVIDE SOME ASSISTANCE TO THE REGIONAL CENTER. TO SEE HOW WE CAN -- MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN MITIGATE THAT RISK. AND THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK IS REALLY A POURTANT AND WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WITH IN CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW AGAIN OUR SYSTEM IS GROWING SO WHEN WE ARE ARE BUILDING THE SERVICES FOR SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WITH VERY COMPLEX NEEDS AS WERE SUPPORTING SERVICES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WELL WE DO HAVE A QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WE DO HAVE STAFF THAT WORK IN THAT ENHANCE THE MESS AND BRINGING IN SOMEBODY THAT CAN HAVE THAT EXPERTISE THAT UNDERSTANDS RISK MANAGEMENT AND A VERY -- PASSIONATE LEVEL BUT ALSO WITH THE EXPERTISE TO BE ABLE TO HELP US ASSESS HOW ARE WE DOING AS A STATE. IN UNDERSTANDING OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND HOW WECAN MOVE FORWARD AND BE ABLE TO HAVE A VERY CLEAR PLAN SO WE CAN HELP. GOING TO MITIGATE RISK -- BY UNDERSTANDING OR TRANS THE QUESTION THAT WAS ALSO IN THE AGENDA FOR US TODAY WAS HOW CAN RESEARCH. ON BE ABLE TO KIND OF ADDRESS SOME OF THE THE DATA CONCERNS ARE TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT ARE THOSE UNMET NEEDS. AS I HAD TALKED JUST A SECOND AGO ABOUT THE COMMUNITY RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT -- PLANS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR LOCAL NEEDS ARE WHAT WERE THE GAPS OF SERVICES ARE THEY CAN REQUEST. FUNDING RELATED TO THAT WELL THAT IS NOT THE VISIBILITY THAT WE HAVE -- AT THE DEPARTMENT LEVEL AS FAR AS UNDERSTANDING KIND OF THOSE THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL ENHANCING OUR RESEARCH SECTION REALLY CAN HELP US. START IDENTIFYING WHAT ARE SOME OF THE DATA ELEMENTS ARE WHAT ARE SOME OF THE DATE THAT THE ABILITY TO DO DATA MEASURES THAT WILL HELP US BROAD AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE ARE GAPS THE SERVICES ARE OR UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S DRIVING OUR TRENDS AND AND CHANGES. AND THAT SECTION THAT RESEARCH SECTION WITH THE ADDITIONAL STAFFING WILL BE ABLE TO ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE DATA INTEGRITY ISSUES THAT WE HAVE. AND THEN WORKING WITH THE-REGIONAL CENTERS -- AS FAR AS THE EFFORTS THAT THEY HAVE SO CAN A COLLECTIVE WHEN NO IT'S A LOT OF INFORMATION BUT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I CAN GIVE YOU. SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES THAT WERE SEEN AS A SYSTEM AND AND THE APPROACH THAT WE WOULD BE USING WITHIN RE ORGANIZATION TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. ONE OF THE THE THINGS YOU WAS ALSO NOTED -- AS FAR AS WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS AND THE OUTCOMES AND HOW CAN THIS BENEFIT CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES. AS I SAID YOU KNOW CERTAINLY SUPPORTING THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND MAKING SURE THEY'RE ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS IT'S IMPORTANT BUT ALSO FOR US IS A DEPARTMENT TO UNDERSTAND SO WE CAN ALSO MAKE SOME -- IMPORTANT DECISIONS THE OUTCOMES ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING THE BEST DECISIONS TO THE INVESTMENT OF THE DOLLARS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE MINISTRATION HAS COMMITTED. TO TO AFFECT THOSE CHANGES ADDITIONALLY WHEN WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT ENHANCING OUR MONITORING OVER SOME OF THE SERVICES FOR THE FAMILY HOME AGENCIES TAKING A LOOK AT HOW WE CAN ENHANCE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH OUR MONITORING FOR WORK SERVICES. THAT ALSO WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE A DIRECT BENEFIT TO INDIVIDUALS -- THAT ARE DEPENDENT ON OUR SERVICES. SO I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS -- THAT -- MAYBE. WITH YOU TODAY. OKAY WELL -- OF FIRST THAT COMES FROM ALEJO. SONYA PADDICK LA -- AND I'LL TRY TO KEEP THESE COMMENTS BRIEF AS SOME OF OUR CONCERNS WERE ADDRESSED IN THE PARTICULAR QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAD FOR THE DEPARTMENT IN THE AGENDA. WE WOULD FIRST NOTE THAT THIS IS A THIS PROPOSAL REPRESENTS A RELATIVELY IT'S I MEAN IT'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY BUT IT'S A RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY -- AND IT REPRESENTS WE THINK A THOUGHTFUL AND TIMELY PROPOSAL -- WHAT'S BEEN PROPOSED IN. IN THIS REQUEST -- MORE ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE DEPARTMENT'S CURRENT -- AN IMMINENT RESPONSIBILITIES WHEN IT COMES TO CONSUMERS AND WE THINK SOME OF THE OVERSIGHT PIECES AND RISK MANAGEMENT AND QUALITY ASSURANCE ACTIVITIES ARE GOOD -- I'LL JUST MAKE THREE POINTS -- FIRST OUR OFFICE THE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SEEN SOME MORE SPECIFIC SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM. GOALS THAT THE DEPARTMENT HOPES TO TO ACHIEVE FROM A CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE HOW HOW ARE THEY REALLY INTENDING TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR CONSUMERS NOT JUST RESPOND TO RISK OR ATTEMPT TO PREVENT A NEGATIVE OUTCOMES BUT HOW ARE THEY ACTUALLY GOING TO SINK. IN YOU KNOW AND FOR IN AN INNOVATIVE WAY ABOUT THE FUTURE -- OUR SECOND KEY POINTS -- DOES CONCERN DATA AND WE WERE HEARTENED TO HEAR WITH DIRECTOR BURGEONING JUST SAID ABOUT THE THE RESEARCH UNIT BUT WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE DEPARTMENT DOES LACK -- OF OF A SYSTEM FOR COLLECTING. DATA IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT SOME OF THE GAPS IN SERVICES NEEDS ARE. AND JUST TAKE TO PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE WE HEARD A LOT OF GREAT ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE OR ANECDOTAL STORIES TODAY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL RECREATION IN CAMP AND WE DO HAVE SOME SURVEY DATA. PROVIDED BY THE ARTIST IN SOCIETY BUT THAT THERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF WE DON'T REALLY KNOW FROM A STATEWIDE PERSPECTIVE JUST HOW MANY CONSUMERS. ARE LACKING THESE SERVICES FEEL THEY NEED THESE SERVICES WOULD LIKE THESE SERVICES SO IT'S IT'S HARD TO MAKE THOSE KINDS OF STRATEGIC DECISIONS WITHOUT THAT THAT KIND OF INFORMATION AT A STATEWIDE. SYSTEMATIC LEVEL AND THEN FINALLY JUST A SMALL POINT REGARDING THE PROPOSAL TO TO OPEN A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OFFICE -- WE JUST NOTE THAT THE DEPARTMENT PROPOSES TO TO HOUSE THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OFFICE ON THE FAIRVIEW DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER PROPERTY UNTIL IT CLOSES. SO THIS IS JUST TO SAY THAT WE WOULD EXPECT THEN THAT THE DEPARTMENT WILL LIKELY BE COMING BACK IN THE FUTURE FOR A REQUEST OF FUNDS TO HOUSE -- THOSE ACTIVITIES SOMEWHERE. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU A FINANCE ANY COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE -- SOME STAKEHOLDER BOTH COMMENTS AND ALSO SOME PROPOSALS OF SORTS SO ALL RIGHT. AND SO WE HAVE AMY WESTLING -- FROM -- DISSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES AND FOLLOWED THEN BY JUDY MARK. THIS BILL VOICES UNITED AND THEN. AND NINETY HAN. AT KATIE HORNBERGER RIGHT. CHANGE IN. DISABILITY RIGHTS OKAY CIVIL -- ASK YOU CAN TRY TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO THREE MINUTES -- THANK YOU WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS AMY WESTLING ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES. WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR HEARING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AS WELL AS YOUR STAFF FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE RIGHT UP WHICH MAKES THE REVIEW OF THIS SO MUCH EASIER. IT'S AN EXCITING TIME IN CALIFORNIA'S DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SYSTEM WE'RE AT THE POINT WHERE. MANY OF US HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THE SYSTEM FOR A VERY LONG TIME LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DAY WHEN IT BECAME A UNIFIED SYSTEM WHERE IT REALLY WAS A COMMUNITY BASED SYSTEM AND SO WE APPRECIATE. THAT THE THAT WERE THERE THAT WE ARE IN A SPACE WHERE THE DEPARTMENT CAN PIVOT TO FOCUS ON THE COMMUNITY. COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES REQUIRES THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN VARIOUS AGENCIES IT REQUIRES SERVICE PROVIDERS TO BE THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND PROVIDING SOMETIMES DAILY SOMETIMES CONTINUOUS SUPPORT. REGIONAL CENTERS FOR LOCAL PLANNING ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION ONGOING SERVICE COORDINATION RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT QUALITY ASSURANCE CLINICAL SERVICES FEDERAL BILLING IT CETERA. AND THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE STATEWIDE PLANNING CONTRACTING MONITORING AND BUDGETING. AS DIRECTOR BRIDGMAN OUTLINED AS THE SYSTEM BECOMES LARGER MORE COMPLEX. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT ALL THREE SEGMENTS OF THE SYSTEM SERVICE PROVIDERS REGIONAL CENTERS AND THE DEPARTMENT HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO DO THEIR JOB. AND IN RECENT YEARS THE DEPARTMENT HASN'T HAD THOSE RESOURCES WHICH HAS LIMITED THEIR ABILITY TO BE RESPONSIVE. TO PEOPLE SERVED IN THE COMMUNITY. BUT ALSO TO REGIONAL CENTERS WHICH HAS MADE IT HARDER TO IMPLEMENT THINGS LIKE DISPARITY GRANTS H. CBS PROPOSALS COMMUNITY PLACEMENT PLANS THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO THIS PROPOSAL MOVING FORWARD IN PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO BE MORE NIMBLE AND RESPONSIVE. AND CAPABLE AND RESPONDING TO ALL OF THE VARIOUS NEEDS BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY EXCITING THINGS GOING ON RIGHT NOW. WE'RE ON THE CUSP OF IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW STANDARDS THAT WOULD REQUIRE GREATER COMMUNITY INTEGRATION AND WE NEED ALL OF THOSE PARTNERS TO BE UP TO SPEED AND CAPABLE TO DO THEIR PART IN THOSE THINGS. ADDITIONALLY I KNOW THAT WE'LL BE HEARING FROM DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA IN JUST A MOMENT AND I DID WANT TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO THANK KATY AS WELL AS CATHERINE PLAGUE MORE THAT DIRECTOR OF DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA FOR ALL OF THEIR WORK. IN LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN SERVE PEOPLE BETTER ADVOCACY GROUPS AND STAKEHOLDERS ALWAYS CHALLENGES TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM ON BEHALF OF THOSE WE SUPPORT. AND I JUST WANT TO EXTEND OUR THANKS TO THE DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA FOR THE COLLABORATIVE PROCESS THAT WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS. TO TAKE SOME OF THEIR PROPOSALS AND REFINE THEM AND THINK ABOUT HOW CAN WE ACHIEVE THE OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE ALL SEEKING TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF PEOPLE. WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND HOW CAN WE WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE THAT END. THANK YOU THANK YOU. SORRY WORK -- PRESIDENT DISABILITIES VOICES UNITED. THE BY AND FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND FAMILY MEMBERS I'M ALSO IN FACT AT FACULTY MEMBER A DISABILITY STUDIES AT UCLA. WE COMMEND DDS FOR THINKING SERIOUSLY ABOUT WAYS TO IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY BUT WE ARE STILL UNCLEAR ABOUT HOW THIS ADDITIONAL A POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN. FIFTY FOUR POSITIONS WILL IMPROVE OUTCOMES THAT MATTER TO OUR COMMUNITY. WILL THIS RESTRUCTURING CHANGE THE FACT THAT SIMILAR INDIVIDUALS READ WILL STILL RECEIVE VASTLY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SERVICE DEPENDING ON WHICH REGIONAL CENTER THEY ARE PART OF WILL THESE FUNDS ENSURE THAT THE INCREDIBLY DELAYED SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM FINALLY BEGINS IT IS SUCCESSFUL. WILL THESE EXTRA POSITIONS MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES GET JOBS AND CAN REMAIN AT HOME EVEN IF THEY'RE STRUGGLING THROUGH CRISIS. HOW WILL THE OR -- HOW THE REORGANIZATION ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE LATINO ARE GETTING THE SAME LEVEL OF SERVICES PEOPLE WHO ARE WHITE -- HOW WILL THIS HELP PEOPLE FAMILIES WHO FEEL INTIMIDATED TO ASK FOR SERVICES FROM THEIR REGIONAL CENTRES? YOU MAY ASK WHAT ONE ADDING FIFTY FOUR NEW POSITIONS BRING ABOUT PROGRESS IN ALL OF THESE FRONTS I MEAN AFTER ALL. DDS IS PROPOSING TO HIRE TWENTY FIVE MORE PEOPLE TO FUNCTION AS REGIONAL CENTER LIAISONS WITH THE DEPLOYMENT OF THESE NEW STAFF. IMPROVE OUTCOMES IN ALL THE WAYS WE CARE ABOUT WELL UNFORTUNATELY THE ANSWER IS NOT NECESSARILY. IF THE NEW STAFF OR NOT EMPOWER TO SOLVE SYSTEMIC ISSUES AND INDIVIDUAL PROBLEMS THEY WILL MOSTLY JUST FEED INFORMATION UP THE FOOD CHAIN AND NOTHING WILL CHANGE. IF THE ADDITIONAL STAFF OR NOT WELL EQUIPPED TO IDENTIFY PROGRAMMATIC OR STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM. TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES EQUITY TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY NOTHING WILL CHANGE. SO HOW WILL WE KNOW FOR RESTRUCTURING PLAN IS ACTUALLY WORKING WELL FIRST WE NEED TO DEFINE MORE CLEARLY. THE CHANGES WE WANT TO SEE AND HOLD THE SYSTEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR ACHIEVING THAT. INSTEAD OF JUST FOCUSING ON PUTTING IN MORE POSITIONS AND MORE FUNDING WE NEED TO FOCUS ON HOW THIS APPROPRIATION WILL AFFECT THE OUTCOMES THAT MATTER TO US. WE NEED TO ASK HOW MUCH IMPROVEMENT CAN WE EXPECT TO SEE AND BY WHAT DATE. AND WE SHOULD SPECIFY THESE OUTCOMES AND TIME LINES IN ADVANCE. SECOND WE SHOULD ASK THE DEPARTMENT TO REPORT BACK ANNUALLY ON A SET OF OUTCOME MEASURES. WE PROVIDED SOME OF THESE IDEAS TO YOUR COMMITTEE AND FINALLY ANY SIGNIFICANT REORGANIZATION SHOULD INCLUDE ADDITIONAL REFORMS THAT PROVIDE FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY OF DDS AND REGIONAL CENTERS. AND WE'VE ALSO PROVIDED SOME IDEAS TO YOUR COMMITTEE. SO AS YOU CAN TELL WE SOLVE MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THIS WILL THIS AB REORGANIZATIONS REALLY CAN IMPROVE THE LIFE OF MY SON AND OTHERS LIKE HIM -- BUT WE HOPE THAT THESE QUESTIONS WILL GET ANSWER TO THIS PROCESS AND WE THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING HOW IT WILL AFFECT OUR FAMILIES. THANK YOU. HI I'M KATY HARBOR AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF CLIENTS RATES ADVOCACY IT DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. AND WE SUPPORT THE EFFORTS BY THE DEPARTMENT TO INCREASE THE OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY SYSTEM. OUT WE ALSO AS AMY INDICATED APPRECIATE ON THE EFFORTS OF OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN THE COMMUNITY TO WORK THROUGH ISSUES TO TRY IMPROVE AND IMPROVE OUR SYSTEM. ON THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN RESPONSIVE ON BOTH TO OUR SUGGESTIONS AS HAS ARCA AND THE REGIONAL CENTERS -- I THINK THE RESTRUCTURE REALLY DOES REFLECT THE CHANGE IN HOW THE DEPARTMENT AND REGIONAL CENTERS PROVIDE SERVICES BYUNITING WAS FORMALLY THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER STREAM ALONG WITH THE COMMUNITY SERVICES STREAM. AS WE PROMOTE A FOCUS ON COMMUNITY SERVICES LIVING. UP. ONE OF THE WITH THE QUESTIONS AS AS MISS MARK INDICATED IS HOW WILL E KNOW IF THIS RESTRUCTURE IS SUCCESSFUL AND I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS COME UP WITH CLICK CLEAR INDICATORS. WE NEED TO OUTLINED THOSE INDICATORS AND OUTLINE A PROCESS FOR PROVIDING THE LEGISLATURE WITH DATA ON THOSE INDICATORS ON A REGULAR POSSIBLY QUARTERLY BASIS SO THAT WE CAN MONITOR WHETHER OR NOT THIS RESTRUCTURE HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE. AND REALLY RESULTED IN GOOD OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE LIKE JUDY SIGN AND THE OTHER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CONSUMERS. ALONG THOSE LINES -- WE ALSO -- HAVE PROPOSALS ON INTO AREAS TO PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY IN THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM THE FIRST ONE IS -- AROUND THE POSTING OF GUIDELINES PROTOCOLS AND ASSESSMENT TOOLS LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRED. REGIONAL CENTERS TO POST ANY GUIDELINES PROTOCOLS ARE ASSESSMENT TOOLS RELATED TO RESPITE AT THE CAP WAS REMOVED IT HAVINGTHOSE TOOLS AVAILABLE TO THAT THE PUBLIC WAS VERY HELPFUL. TO PEOPLE TO BEST UNDERSTAND HOW TO MAKE THEIR REQUESTS AND WHAT TYPES OF FACTS REGIONAL CENTERS WOULD NEED IF WE WERE ABLE TO POST THOSE FOR ALL SERVICES THAT WOULD GIVE. THE PUBLIC ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SO THAT THEY COULD BETTER PREPARE FOR A P. P. MEETINGS AND WORKING WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER WORKERS. THE OTHER IS -- TO HAVE REGIONAL CENTERS PROVIDE A LIST OF AGREED UPON SERVICES AND SUPPORTS AT THE END OF AN I. P. P. MEETING. IN ORDER FOR AYE PP SERVICES TO BEGAN THE REGIONAL CENTER HAS TO HAVE A CONSENT FOR SERVICES SIGNED BY THE CONSUMER OR FAMILY IF THEY'RE MINORS -- WHAT HAPPENS NOW IS THAT IN MANY REGIONAL CENTERS THE SERVICE COORDINATOR MEETS WITH THE FAMILY GOES BACK TO HER HIS OR HER OFFICE DRAFTS AN I. P. P.? THE I. P. P. IS SUPPOSED TO BE SENT OUT IN FORTY FIVE DAYS THAT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE GIVEN HIGH CASELOADS AND GIVEN SERVICE COORDINATOR SHORTAGES -- AND SHORTAGES OF SUPPORT STAFF. SO IT'S SOME CENTERS THE WAY TO REMEDY THE S. AND TO NOT HAVE A LONG GAP IN A SECURING A CONSENT FOR SERVICES SO SERVICES CAN BEGIN. IS HAVING PEOPLE SIGN A BLANK DOCUMENT ON THE IT'S A CONSENT FOR SERVICE AS A LAWYER I AM PARTICULARLY OPPOSED TO PEOPLE SIGNING BLANK DOCUMENTS. OF AND ON INSTEAD WHAT AT LEAST ONE REGIONAL CENTER DOES IS THEY ACTUALLY FILL OUT OF JUST A BLANK SHEET OF PAPER AT THE END OF THE MEETING THAT INCLUDES SERVICE DURATION FREQUENCY PROVIDER IF KNOWN. EACH THE FAMILY GETS A COPY REGIONAL CENTER KEEPS A COPY THEY CAN SIGN FOR CONSENT FOR KNOWN SERVICES. A QUICK EASY KIND OF CHEAP WAY TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE HAS THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. RIGHT A QUESTION FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY SO WELL I GUESS -- CORRECT DO YOU WANT TO WE HAVE WRAPS RESPOND A LITTLE BIT TO WHAT YOU HEARD AND I THINK PEOPLE TALK ABOUT MEASURES AND HOUSES. STRUCTURING GOING TO ACTUALLY LEAD TO CHANGE FOR THE ACTUAL CLIENTS SO I KNOW YOU TRUST SOMEONE YOUR PRESENTATION BUT MAYBE CAN GET A MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE RAISED. NO THANK YOU SENATOR -- WE WHEN IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE REMAIN ENGAGED IN THE CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR COMMUNITY YOU SEE WHAT DELIVERABLES AND HOW THINGSARE MOVING FORWARD. AND WHAT SOME OF THE THE ELEMENTS WITHIN THE RESTRUCTURE THAT MAY NOT HAVE LIKE A DIRECT LINK TO OUTCOMES AND MEASURES AND OTHERS PROBABLY WOULD -- I LET ME GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES WITH THE EARLY START ADDITIONAL STAFF THAT WE HAVE WITH THAT REALLY START PROGRAM. WE WOULD BE INCREASE SEEN OUR OVERSIGHT OF OUR EARLY START GRANT. AND MONITORING AS FAR AS WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS. AND TO THE SERVICES IS TO HOWEVER WE DELIVERING THOSE SERVICES NOT ONLY WITHIN THE GRANT. BUT IT IS ALSO THAN MAKING THE DIFFERENCE IN TO THOSE FAMILIES LIVES BECAUSE IF THERE ARE -- ELEMENTS WHERE THERE'S IN NON COMPLIANCE THAT SIGNIFICANT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THOSE ISSUES EARLIER SO. FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW WE REVIEW EVERY THREE YEARS WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THE REVIEW ON AN ANNUAL BASIS -- AS AN EXAMPLE WE DID HAVE ONE REGIONAL CENTER WHERE WE WERE NOTING ON OUR REVIEWS THAT THEY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE REST OF THE STATE. AS FAR AS COMPLIANCE AND BEING ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE MARKERS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO NOT ONLY SERVICES TO BUT TO THE GRANT. VERY QUICKLY WE'RE ABLE WITHIN YOU KNOW WHILE WE WERE ABLE TO MONITOR IT FOR THREE YEARS WHEN WE DID FIND OUT WE WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER THEY QUICKLY -- MADE THE CORRECTIONS AND CORRECTED IT AND IT TOOK HIM A LITTLE BIT OF TIME THIS WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF IF WE'RE DOING THE MONITORING ON AN ANNUAL BASIS WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT THREE YEARS. TO SEE THAT THERE'S A A PROBLEM OR SOMETHING THAT WERE NOT SEEN IN A COMPLIANCE SETS AN EXAMPLE HEALTH AND SAFETY -- REVIEWS WE DO GET A LOT OF HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUEST THE TIME FOR US TO BE ABLE TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO REVIEW THOSE AND BE RESPONSIVE AND GET THOSE RESPONSES BACK TO THE REGIONAL CENTERS INTO THE COMMUNITY IS REALLY IMPORTANT. THAT THOSE ARE VERY TANGIBLE THINGS THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO SO JUST GIVING YOU A COPLE OF EXAMPLES THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEE THE BENEFIT DIRECTLY FOR INDIVIDUALS. I'M WITHIN THE EARLY START BUT WE WOULD SEE COMPLIANCE ON A BROADER SCALE -- SO THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME THINGS THAT WE WOULD BE PUTTING FORWARD THAT WILL BE ABLE -- TO SEE CHANGES THAT ARE GOING TO BE A BENEFIT AS A SYSTEM AS A WHOLE THAT ULTIMATELY IS SPECIFIC TO CONSUMERS SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND COUPLE MORE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL -- SO I KNOW THAT -- YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT THE ACTUALLY THERE'S A CONSERVE ON US MEANT IN -- SO THE REAL RISK MANAGEMENT QUALITY ASSURANCE RIGHT YOURSELF WISHING OFFICE -- WE HAVE POSITIONS IS -- THAT ARE BEING ADDED -- AND SO FORTH -- IS THAT. THE IS THAT OFF I MEAN SO THERE'S THE RISK MANAGEMENT PART AND I THINK PEOPLE WANT NOT JUST ABOUT RISK MANAGEMENT BUT YOU KNOW BECAUSE QUALITY ASSURANCE RISK MEASURE IN TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD -- IS IS THAT OFFICE JUST DEALING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OURS IT ALSO DEALING WITH POLICIES AND SO FORTH FOR DIVERSE CONTRACT IS LIKE THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT THE QUESTION CENTER TODAY -- PART OF WITH THE THE CHANGE OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS CLOSING FROM WE HAVE BEEN OPERATING AS WE HAVEN'T NUMBER TO REGIONAL CENTERS BY THE WAY YEAH I'M SORRY. A AND REGIONAL CENTERS A. SHE'S RIGHT SO WE HAVE -- WITHIN HEADQUARTERS WE HAVE THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER DIVISION AND THEN WE HAVE -- COMMUNITY SERVICES DIVISION -- SO NOW WITH -- MAKING A CHANGE WITH THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER DIVISION GOING TO A STATE OPERATED -- WE REALLY NEED TO TO TAKE A LOOK AT DO WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE THE FUNCTIONS VERY SEPARATE. EVERYTHING SEPARATE FOR RISK MANAGEMENT QUALITY MANAGEMENT ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER SIDE AND THEN THE SAME FOR THE REGIONAL CENTER SIDE WE HAVE YOU KNOW OUR HR PRACTICES THAT WERE ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER SIDE WE HAD AT HEADQUARTERS HR. SO WITH THE RESTRUCTURE WE WOULD BE CENTRALIZING MANY OF THESE FUNCTIONSONE OF THOSE CORE FUNCTIONS IS THE RISK MANAGEMENT AND QUALITY MANAGEMENT SO WITHIN THAT OFFICE THAT OFFICE WOULD HAVE COMPLETE OVERSIGHT. OF ALL OF THE THE STATE SERVICES AS WELL AS REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES KIND OF MONITORING -- THE THE DATA THAT GOES WITH THAT BUT WITH THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS IT WOULD BE MONITORING AS FAR AS THE COMPLIANCE WITH OUR LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND AGAIN AS WE'RE MOVING TO THE STATE OPERATE IN THE COMMUNITY WE'RE GONNA NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. AN OFFICE WITHIN HEADQUARTERS THAT IS ALSO PAYING ATTENTION -- TO THE QUALITY MEASURES THAT ARE OCCURRING THERE ONE LAST COMMENT IS THAN ON THE QUALITY MANAGEMENT SIDE IS THAT WE DO HAVE A CONTRACT FOR A NATIONAL CORE INDICATORS. BY HAVING A VERY FOCUSED WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ENHANCE KIND OF THE ANALYSIS AND GOING TO BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM. THE OUTCOMES THAT WERE SEEN WITHIN THE NATIONAL CORE INDICATORS WHICH IS A DIRECT. REPORTING TO US ON THE SATISFACTION OF CONTENT FROM CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES SO MAKING THAT LINK AND AGAIN THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE A SEPARATE SYSTEM. IT'S EVERYBODY COMING TOGETHER ONE LAST NOTE IS THAT WE'RE HAVING IT REPORT TO THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR UNDER OUR RATIONS. SO IT WOULD NOT BE REPORTING TO PROGRAM SO WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A SEPARATE OVERSIGHT FOR REGIONAL CENTER KIND OF SYSTEM. SERVICES WHICH IS THE COMMUNITY SERVICES AS WELL AS THE STATE OPERATED SERVICES SO WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE AN OBJECTIVE VANTAGE POINT WHEN WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES. AND A NO YOU HAVE A RESEARCH UNIT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS AS WELL AND THAT AND ON ONE LEVEL OF COURSE IS A RESEARCHER MYSELF ALWAYS EXCITING TO SEE RICHARD UNIT. BUT I THINK THERE WERE SOME QUESTIONS WERE RAISED IN THE PAST -- AND I NOTE THAT WE ARE ALSO GOING TO BE ADDING MORE PEOPLE TO THE RESEARCH UNIT AND THAT -- AND DIZZY AND NINE TIMES FAVOR RESEARCH UNIT -- I THINK BUT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT COME UP IN THE PAST AND PRICE STILL ELEMENT THERE IN TERMS OF WHAT ARE WHAT ARE THEY RESEARCHING AND ARE TO HOW THIS TOPICS THAT THEIR FOR RESEARCHING FOCUSING ON GONNA THEN. BENEFIT THE THE THE CLIENTS SO -- THAT HOWARD THE HOUSE A RESEARCH AGENDA BEING SET FOR FOR THIS -- RESEARCH UNIT. THANK YOU AND AS I SAID -- BRIEFLY MENTIONED THAT WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT OUR RESEARCH SECTION AND HOW THEY ARE ABLE -- TO PRODUCE AND RICK TAKE A LOOK AT OUR DATA. MUCH OF IT WE ALSO WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE WHAT IS OUR KIND OF MISSING GAPS IN OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT THE DATA. SO THE FIRST THING THAT WE WOULD REALLY WANT THEM TO DO IS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THE TIME TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND CUT IT ANALYZE WHAT ARE THE SYSTEMS THAT WE'RE USING TO COLLECT IT. WHAT IS SOME OF THE DATA THAT'S GOING TO BE INFORMATIVE TO US WORK WITH THE DIFFERENT BRANCHES WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT AND THEN ALSO TAKING A LOOK AT? KIND OF BROADER WHAT'S GOING TO BE HELPFUL WE SPEND QUITE A BIT OF TIME TAKING -- LOOKING AT SOME OF THE WORK WITH THE DISPARITY GRANTS BUT I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO FOCUS SOME ADDITIONAL EFFORTS RIGHT NOW ON OUR SAFETY NET. SO WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT AS WERE BUILDING THE SERVICES WHAT IS INFORMING US AND LETTING US KNOW. THAT THOSE ARE THE SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED SO TRACKING AND UNDERSTANDING WITH THE A. M. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW MODEL SO SERVICE WHETHER IT'S ENHANCE BE ABLE SUPPORTS HOMES COMMUNICATE RICE'S HOMES. STATE OPERATED STAR SERVICES ARE. MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES HAVE BEEN IN THE ABILITY TO HAVE A STRUCTURE RIGHT NOW TO SAY HOW ARE WE GOING TO SURE THE SUCCESS OF THOSE -- AND THEN BE ABLE TO EVALUATE HOW WE WOULD REPLICATED IF THAT WOULD BE WARRANTED SO AGAIN IT'S TAKING THAT LINK TO ASSESSING KIND OF OUR STRUCTURE OF DATA. TAKING A LOOK AT HOW WE'RE DOING THE ANALYSIS OF THAT TAKING A LOOK AT HOW WE CAN START DOING THAT MEASURES EARLY ON IS WERE IMPLEMENTING THESE NEW. MODELS OF SERVICE AND NEW INITIATIVES AND THEN ON BEING ABLE -- TO REPORT BACK AND AND BE ABLE TO INFORM FUTURE POLICY DECISIONS OF NEEDED. OKAY AND THEN -- I ALSO NOTE THAT IN THE DIAGRAM SO BASICALLY YOU'RE THE DEPARTMENT'S GOING TO HAVE CENTURY A PROGRAM SERVICES PEAS SENATE OPERATIONS AND UNDER SEPARATE DEBBIE DOCTORS I PRESUME. AND I THINK YOU DID SPEAK TO SOME EXTENT SAMPLE BEFORE TALK MY QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ARE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A CALL INSURANCE AND AND THAT KIND OF MONITORING YOU WANT SOME SEPARATION BUT SAME TIME I WON YEAH. BUT BE SURE WE DON'T HAVE A CELL IS ATION BETWEEN THE PROGRAM FOLKS IN THE OPERATION FOLKS THERE'S ACTUALLY IN MANY WAYS -- WHILE SOME THERE MAY BE SOME OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS BUT IS ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM FOLKS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE OPERATIONS FOLKS RUNNING OFF AND DOING THEIR OWN THING -- AND THEN DISTRICT CREATING MORE BURDENS ON THE CLICK ON THE PROGRAM FOLKS BECAUSE IN A WHILE SINCE I'M LEGAL I CAN TREAT MORE LEGAL THINGS TO DO. AT CETERA SO -- DO YOU SPEAK TO COORDINATION DALE HOW THE HOUSE WE'RE GOING -- TO HI. HOW YOU SEE THE TWO DIVISIONS AND NOT BECOMING SO AS IT RELATES TO YOUR FOR TO COME TOGETHER BUT? EXACTLY THE TIES THAT YOU SEE TO BE SURE THAT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE OPERATIONS FOLKS ARE ARE RELEVANT TO THE PROGRAM THANKS AND ANYWAYS -- YEAH. ABSOLUTELY AND YOU KNOW IT THIS ACTUALLY IS AN AREA THAT IS. VERY IMPORTANT TO ME YOU KNOW WHEN I STARTED THAT THE DEPARTMENT AS A DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND THEN CERTAINLY COMING AS A DIRECTOR. I HAD A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE WHEN I CAME TO THE DEPARTMENT I I HAD NOT WORKED -- AT THE DEPARTMENT AND SO WHEN I I CAME IN IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE NOT WORKING IN SILOS. AND SO WE WERE SHARING OF INFORMATION BECAUSE THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HAD NOTED AND PART OF THAT HAD TO DO WITH THE FUNCTION THAT WE'RE OPERATING THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER DIVISIONS. THAT WAS VERY SPECIFIC YOU KNOW I EIGHT I AM SO PROUD OF THE WORK THAT OUR STAFF DO AT THE DEVELOPMENTAL CNTERS YOU KNOW OUT IN THE COMMUNITY THAT THE THICK THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I I TEASE THEM A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IS THAT OFTENTIMES WILL SAY TO ME OR THEY'LL SAY TO US IS THAT WELL YOU KNOW ALL OF YOU IT DDS. AND I KEEP SAYING YOU GUYS ARE DDS AND IT'S HELPING UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE ARE REALLY A TEAM AND WORKING TOGETHER. AND SO WORKING THROUGH THE CULTURE AND MAKING SURE THAT FOLKS ARE WORKING TOGETHER HAS REALLY BEEN KIND OF THE THE MISSION THAT I'VE WORKED ON OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AND MAKING SURE THAT CROSS WALK IS HAPPENING SO AN EFFORT THAT THE WAY THAT WE'RE DOING THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE A SIDE ROAD SYSTEM. THAT THEY'RE NOT TALKING THAT THERE'S COLLABORATIVE WAYS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE THAT DIALOGUE. THAT AS WERE HAVING THE REGIONAL CENTER STAFF THIS IS VERY TRUE ALSO WITH OUR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OFFICE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE VERY GOOD. AND PROVIDING THOSE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WERE HAVING THE COLLABORATIVE DISCUSSIONS WE ARE GOING TO ALSO BE DOING SOME TECHNOLOGY AS FAR AS MAKING SURE WE HAVE THE VIDEO CONFERENCING. GRANTED THAT'S JUST ONE PIECE BUT WE ALSO HAVE THE SCHEDULE OF MEETINGS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE HAVING THE COLLABORATIVE DISCUSSIONS OF SHARING INFORMATION. ONE OF THE THINGS WE ARE DOING IS TAKING A LOOK AT BRINGING TOGETHER THE INFORMATION THIS IS WHERE RESEARCH WILL BE ABLE TO HELP US. IS SAYING FOR EVERY REGIONAL CENTER WHAT IS THE INFORMATION THAT INFORMS US ABOUT WHAT IS OCCURRING WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT ALSO WITHIN OUR STATE OPERATED SERVICES SO WE WE HAVE VERY MUCH THOUGHT ABOUT -- WHAT ARE THE WAYS THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE -- PUTTING UP SYSTEMS THAT ARE GOING TO BE A BARRIER TO DOING WHAT WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH. OKAY -- ALL RIGHT WELL THE APPRECIATE THAT -- AND I THINK YOU KNOW IT -- WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A I THINK THE THE INCREASE STAFF FOR MORE OVERSIGHT I THINK ACTUALLY AND AND TRYING TO GET MORE CONSISTENCY I KNOW THE MAN REGIONAL CENTERS TO BE ON EXCELLENT JOB AND AND AND NAY OF HAVE VERY INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS WE'LL SEE HOW WE DISSEMINATE THAT. HOW CAN THE STATE PLAY A GREATER ROLE -- AND ALSO -- WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS I KNOW DEVELOP THE SURGEON CLOSING DOWN YOU STILL WILL HAVE A UNIT -- REPORTER PHIL -- AND THEN THE VARIOUS OTHER ACTUALLY THE REPLACEMENTS FOR THEM RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT'S ALL COORDINATED SO. AND WE NEED SURE STAFF FOR THAT OKAY. ALL RIGHT WELL THANKS VERY MUCH AND I THINK WE'RE NOW MOVING ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE SEVEN THANKS VERY MUCH -- PALACES WELL FOR THE ISSUES THAT YOU'VE RAISED AS WELL. OKAY SO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE IS A FEDERAL HAS A B. C. P. THE SAME PROPOSAL FEDERAL CLAIMS REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM PROJECT OKAY ALL. ACTUALLY FIVE WE HAVE SOME NEW TV PEOPLE THE TABLE THE COULD INTRODUCE THEMSELVES -- ZERO OKAY I THINK. RON ROBINETTE WITH DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT OKAY. RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- THE THE OF FEDERAL CLAIMS REIMBURSEMENT PROJECT IS THE AGENDA. CORRECTLY POINTS OUT IS A REPLACEMENT SYSTEM FOR A THIRTY SIX YEAR OLD LEGACY SYSTEM -- V. THAT PROCESSES -- FEDERAL CLAIMS REIMBURSEMENTS. IN. THE CURRENT YEAR. TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN OUR FEDERAL CLAIMS ARE PROJECTED TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION. GIVEN THE AGE OF THE SYSTEM THE DEPARTMENT HAS DIFFICULTY MAINTAINING AND PROGRAMMING THE SYSTEM -- IT'S WRITTEN IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROGRAMMING. WHICH IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO FIND INDIVIDUALS WHO. ARE FAMILIAR WITH AND TRAINED IN THAT LANGUAGE -- AS A RESULT WE'RE EXPECTING TO SPEND APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT YEAR -- TO ASSIST WITH SYSTEM MAINTENANCE -- IN ADDITION THE CURRENT SYSTEM LIMITATIONS PREVENT AUTOMATED IN TIMELY RECONCILIATION ACTIVITIES. IN THIS REQUIRES MANUAL WORKAROUNDS. THESE MANUAL PROCESS IS PREVENT TIMELY -- BILLINGS AND AS A RESULT -- WE HAVE LEFT APPROXIMATELY. THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ON THE TABLE ANNUALLY. IN ON RECOVERED REIMBURSEMENTS. THE THE DEPARTMENT'S GOAL FOR THE THE GOALS FOR THE NEW PROJECT ARE WE HAVE THREE GOALS AND WE WANT TO MAXIMIZE. A FEDERAL FUNDING PARTICIPATION. WE WANT TO REDUCE THE FISCAL IMPACT TO THE STATE OF MAINTAINING THE EXISTING SYSTEM. AND WE WANT TO ESTABLISH A FRAMEWORK THAT WILL SUPPORT. ALL OUR FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE ADMINISTERED BY THE APARTMENT. AS YOU CHEN ALSO POINTS OUT. THE DEPARTMENT RECEIVED -- THE STAGE TO APPROVAL. FOUR AT WHICH IS THE ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS OF THE ODJICK LIFECYCLE. AND THAT THAT APPROVAL WAS RECEIVED FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IN AUGUST. TWENTY EIGHTEEN OF SO WE'VE BEEN AUTHORIZED TO PROCEED WITH STAGES THREE AND FOUR TO PLAN FOR SOLICITATION AND AND PROVIDE INPUT YOUR CONTRACTOR. WE EXPECT TO RELEASE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN IN AWARD THE CONTRACT IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY WE EXPECT THAT THE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION WILL TAKE APPROXIMATELY. TWO YEARS FROM THE AWARD OF THE CONTRACT -- THE AGENDA ALSO S.. A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT ON ANY AFFECTS ON PROJECT COSTS DURING -- STAGES THREE AND FOUR OF THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE -- WE WE DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT ANY OF THE STEPS THAT ARE REQUIRED DURING EITHER STAGE THREE OR FOUR WILL AFFECT PROJECT COSTS -- THE ACTIVITIES THAT OUR CURRENT STAGE THREE AND FOUR FOCUSED ON PREPARING THE SOLICITATION PACKAGE. AND SELECTING A PROJECT VENDOR. PROJECT COST ESTIMATES IN INFORMATION WERE GATHERED. DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE STAGE -- TO ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS PROJECT [inaudible] SO -- IS STAGE THREE CONSISTS OF SOLUTION DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS FINALIZING -- PROJECT DETAILS SUCH AS THE CONTRACT STATEMENT OF WORK AND THE SOLICITATION PACKAGE -- AN THEN THIS WORK WILL HELP PREPARE US FOR OUR STAGE. FOR IN STAGE FOR THE PROJECT RATING IS AN APPROVALS -- PHASE OF THE PROJECT -- IS IT'S BASICALLY THE PROCUREMENT FACE. THE WILL RELEASE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL WILL INTERACT WITH INTERESTED BIDDERS AND EVALUATE PROPOSALS AND EVENTUALLY -- AWARD A CONTRACT. ONCE WE'VE RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM THE DEPARTMENT A TECHNOLOGY. THE AGENDA ALSO LAST OF WHETHER WE ANTICIPATED ANY OF THE INFORMATION GATHERED. DURING A STAGE FOR OF THE POWER PROCESS WILL RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS AND AGAIN WE DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING BECAUSE STAGE FOUR IS THE PROCUREMENT. OF PORTION OF IT THE BASELINE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT THAT THE TIMELINE THE COSTS WILL BE SET BY THAT POINT. SO WE DON'T EXPECT WOULD WE EXPECT TO USE THAT INFORMATION TO GO OUT TO BID AND WE DON'T EXPECT PROJECT COST TO CHANGE AT THAT TIME. HEY COME IT'S FAMILIAL MEDIC ALEJO -- WE AGREE WITH THE DEPARTMENT IN THE IMPORTANCE OF MODERNIZING THIS I. T. SYSTEM SO WITHOUT REGARD TO THE MERITS OF THE PARTICULAR PROPOSAL -- YOU MAY BE AWARE THAT OUR OFFICE HAS EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS ABOUT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT I. T. PROJECTS ACROSS DEPARTMENTS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL THERE ARE SEVEN OF THEM. THAT ARE REQUESTING ESSENTIALLY THE FULL DOLLAR AMOUNT THE FULL MULTI DOLLAR -- MULTI YEAR DOLLAR AMOUNTS -- TO FINISH THE I. T. PROJECTS THE THE FULL DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION. WHAT WE WOULD POINT OUT IS IT'S VERY HARD FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE AN IMPORTANT OVERSIGHT FUNCTION IF THEY'RE BEING ASKED TO PROVIDE AN AUTHORIZED ALL OF THE FUNDING BEFORE THEY HAVE THE BENEFIT OF SEEING? THE STAGES THREE AND FOUR RESULTS AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE -- THE CONTRACT WOULD NOT BE AWARDED UNTIL THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY WHICH IS NOT THIS UPCOMING FISCAL YEAR IT'S THE FISCAL YEAR AFTER THAT. SO WE THINK. YOU KNOW WITHOUT STALLING THE DEPARTMENT -- THE LEGISLATURE COULD APPROVE A SINGLE YEAR OF FUNDING FOR THE PLANNING -- COSTS IN NINETEEN TWENTY N. THE DEPARTMENT COULD COME BACK NEXT YEAR WITH THE PROPOSAL FOR THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION FUNDING THEY MAY STILL NOT HAVE -- HAVE -- NECESSARILY A MORE PRECISE ESTIMATE OF COSTS AND STILL JUST BE PUTTING OUT THE SOLICITATION FOR BID AT THAT TIME. BUT WE EXPECT THEY WILL KNOW MORE ABOUT -- THE PROJECT IN GENERAL FROM CONDUCTING THE STAGE. THREE OF THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE PROCESS AND THE LAST POINT I WOULD. WANT TO MAKE IS THAT BEFORE GIVING THEIR FINAL APPROVAL BEFORE THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GIVE THEIR FINAL APPROVAL TO ANY. IT PROJECT THEY BENEFIT FROM SEEING ALL FOUR STAGES OF THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE WHERE IS IN THIS PROPOSAL THE LEGISLATURE'S BEING ASKED TO GIVE THAT. FINAL APPROVAL. WITHOUT THAT BENEFIT. THANK YOU FINANCE. COMMENTS ALL RIGHT -- ACTUALLY ANY COMMENTS FROM THE KNOWLEDGE AT THE MOMENT THANK YOU CENTER PAN A YES JUST REALLY BRIEFLY THE OPEN AND COMPETITIVE BID PROCESS THAT WILL BE DONE DURING STAGE FOR WHEN THE SOLICITATION IS GOING TO BE RELEASED -- IT MAY IMPACT THE FINAL COST -- THE PROJECTS THAT HAVE COMPLETED ALL FOUR STAGES OF THE PROJECT APPROVAL BY CYCLE EIGHTEEN OF THEM -- THE COSTER ACTUALLY TRENDING DOWNWARD TEY'RE ACTUALLY COMING IN AT 8% LESS. THAN THE ESTIMATES THAT ARE PROVIDED IN STAGE TIM. AND A REMINDER THAT WHEN WE ADOPTED THE PROJECT TO POOL IFE CYCLE IN -- TWENTY SIXTEEN IT IT. MODIFIED THE WAY THAT WE APPROVE PROJECTS AND SO MOST OF THE TIME INVESTMENT DECISIONS ARE ACTUALLY MADE. AFTER THE MARKET RESEARCH IS DONE AND SUBSTANTIATED LIKE THE DEPARTMENT HAS DONE IN STAGE -- TWO ALTHOUGH THE CONTRACT WON'T BE EXECUTED WHERE THERE'S BOOTS ON THE GROUND FOR THE CONTRACTORS TO COME HELP BUILD THE NEW SYSTEM. WE ARE LOOKING AT A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD IN MARCH OF NEXT YEAR. AND SO ANY DELAY TO THE PROJECT FUNDING I WOULDN'T WANT. ANY OF THAT TO IMPACT THE SOLICITATION PROCESS AND POSSIBLY DISCOURAGE VENDORS FROM BETTING. ON ON THIS PROPOSAL -- REMINDER OF SOME OF THE CHECK POINTS THAT WE HAVE. IF THE PROJECT COSTS COME IN DURING STAGE FOR FOR THE FINAL FINAL PROJECT COST. AT OVER FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS ESTIMATED IN STATES -- TO BEEN THERE'S A A CAUSE FOR PAWS AND REFLECTION WITH THE DEPARTMENT AS TO HOW WE WOULD MOVE FORWARD. CANCERS PLANNING DOLLARS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROPOSAL THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUIRED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS TO SUBMIT A PROJECT EXPENDITURE REPORT TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- SO WE CAN SEE HOW THEY'RE EXPENDING THESE THESE PLANNING DOLLARS. AND ONCE THE PROJECT COMPLETES ALL FOUR STAGES OF THE PROJECT APPROVAL BY CYCLE. THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT ON A MONTHLY BASIS A PROJECT STATUS REPORT ON HOW THEY THINK THINGS ARE GOING WITH THE PROJECT. AND ALSO THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. A WILL BE FURNISHING AN INDEPENDENT PROJECT OVERSIGHT REPORT. IF THE PROJECT COST ARE 10% OVER WHAT WAS BASS LINED -- AND THEN THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE WOULD BE NOTIFIED AT AT THAT POINT OTHERWISE -- COST MANAGEMENT IS DONE AT THE DEPARTMENT AND WITH THE PERMANENT -- TECHNOLOGIES OVERSIGHT. OKAY SO SO JUST. THIS IS THE CLARIFY IS THE FIRST OF ALL -- THE NATURE OF THIS PROJECT CLEARLY OF A VERY OLD SYSTEM WE HAVE TO REPLACE IT -- IT IS [inaudible] IS SO. SOMEONE TOLD THE NEW SYSTEM -- IS DO YOU VIEWS THE NATURE OF THE SYSTEM THAT BASICALLY SAYS. WE'RE JUST GONNA GO AND BUILD ONE NEW SYSTEM IS IT GOING TO BE MORE MODULAR I DON'T THAT DAY I MEAN I I THEY WERE. BASICALLY STATES YOU SO YOU DON'T HAVE THE SCOPE SO I'M JUST LIKE WHAT KIND OF SYSTEM ARE WE LOOKING AT PRODUCING. THEREFORE DOES IT THE CELL. YEAH THAT THAT THE ACTUAL BUILDER THE SYSTEM IN THE RECOMMENDED ALTERNATIVE THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS -- PUT FORTH IS POSTED ON OUR ON OUR WEBSITE AND YOU CAN SEE THE DETAILS OF THAT OUR STAFF CAN SEE THE DETAILS OF THAT -- THIS APPROACH IS ACTUALLY A MODULAR APPROACH LIKE YOU'RE SUGGESTING -- THEY HAVE SUBSTANTIATED THE THE MARKET RESEARCH BY REACHING OUT TO OTHER STATES TO SEE HOW THEY'RE DOING THIS IN THE SYSTEM. AND THEN ALSO LOOKED AT OTHER PLATFORMS THAT OTHERS STATE OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENTS HAVE USED TO SUBSTANTIATE THE COST. IN THE APPROACH ON THE PROJECT SO THEN ASSISTED ITS MODULAR DO YOU EXPECT TO JUST GO OUT FOR A ONE VENDOR TO DO ALL THE MODULES ARE WE LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW. THE DATES FOR DIFFERENT MODULES. THE THE PROCUREMENT APPROACH THAT THEY'VE SELECTED IN AND WANTS DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY AGREES WITH IS A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. THAT COULD BE THAT WAY AND VENDOR COMES BACK WITH HERE'S MY PRODUCT AND AND THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO CONFIGURE THE THE THE PRODUCT -- MULTIPLE VENDORS CAN CAN. BIND TOGETHER AND SUBMIT A PROPOSAL THAT TAKES PIECES OF OF ONE PARTICULAR FUNCTIONALITY AND ATTACH IT TO ANOTHER PART. ANOTHER PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY SO -- IT'S IT'S OPEN AND COMPETITIVE IN HOW THE APPROACH FOR THE PROJECT AND AND ULTIMATELY THE SOLUTION. I WILL BE IDENTIFIED. AND IN TERMS OF THE MAINTENANCE OF THE SYSTEM AFTER TO PRODUCE THAT COULD BE A SEPARATE CONTRACTORS THAT PART OF THIS PACKAGE. THE THE MAINTENANCE COSTS ARE ARE IN THIS PACKAGE OKAY. SOI GUESS THE OTHER. SO -- SO WHAT THE LA -- PRESENTED US SO WILL HAPPEN IS THAT YOU'RE STILL DOING STAGE THREE WHICH IS THE PRESIDENT SOMEWAY SEVENTY CERTIFY THE PASSAGE TO BUT EXACTLY FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU NEED AND THE MORE DETAILS CORRECT AND THEN STAGE FORCED PROCUREMENT. CORRECT THE STATE'S THREE IT'S IS PRIMARILY BUILDING THE SOLICITATION IN THIS CASE THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL PACKAGE OKAY AND HOW AND HOW THAT PACKAGE WILL BE EVALUATED ONCE BIDS ARE SUBMITTED. OKAY AFTER STATES THREE APPROVAL -- AT THE VERY BEGINNING STAGE FORCE WHEN THE SOLICITATION ACTUALLY HITS THE STREET OKAY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN SEPTEMBER OF NINETEEN RIGHT THE R. P.. IT'S GOING TO GO OUT. PEOPLE RESPOND CELLS THERE'S A QUESTION SO I SO I GUESS THERE'S A QUESTION THE DAILY -- RAISED ABOUT WELL. YOU'RE NOT GOING -- AWARD. UNTIL FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY WHATEVER BUDGET WE PASS NEXT YEAR WILL GO ON THE PLACE IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY SO CERTAINLY MONTHS BEFORE -- I MEAN WE CAN GUESS CENTURY DAVE WE'VE BEEN OUT HOW MUCH THE PEOPLE PAID -- FOR WHY DO WE NEED TO DECIDE WHERE IT'S AT I THINK THERE'S A WILLINGNESS ALLOCATE THE PLANNING MONEY AND SO FORTH -- THIS YEAR'S THE REASON WHY WE NEED. TO BUDGET THE MONEY FOR NEXT BUDGET YEAR FOR THIS NOW. VERSES NEXT YEAR WHEN YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE BIDS IN HAND SO YOU MIGHT IT YOU'LL KNOW WHAT THE HIGH DID A LITTLE BIT AND SO FORTH SO YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF EXACTLY HOW MUCH MONEY WE REALLY NEED. TO BUDGET FOR THIS -- I WOULD JUST SAY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES PERSPECTIVE IF THERE'S ANY EFFICIENCIES TO BE GAINED DURING THE SOLICITATION PROCESS. AND THIS CONTRACT IS READY TO AWARD WITHIN THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR -- IN THIS CASE ACCORDING TO OUR OUR CURRENT PROJECT SCHEDULE -- IN IN MARCH OF NEXT YEAR. THEN THE CONTRACT WOULD BE HELD FOR THREE MONTHS UNTIL THE NEXT BUDGET YOUR TOES SO SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE YOU MIGHT EVEN BE ABLE YOU MIGHT EVEN SIDE TOWARD THIS. FOR FOUR AND MARCH. I THERE ARE THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT DURING THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS WE MIGHT FIND SOME EFFICIENCIES AND BE BE ABLE TO AWARD THE CONTRACT AND GET CONTRACTORS ONBOARD. BEFORE THE END OF THE BUDGET YEAR. OKAY AND THE OKAY YES FINANCE NO I WOULD JUST. KIND OF ADD ONS THAT I THINK I THINK WHAT YOU'RE HEARING IS IS THAT. WITH THE FULL PROJECT COSTS BUILT IN A IN THIS PROPOSAL IT PROVIDES US THE FLEXIBILITY TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE SOME EFFICIENCIES THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. TO ALLOW US -- TO PROCEED WITH THE PROJECT -- SOLICITATION EARLIER THAN ANTICIPATED OKAY -- FAN LA -- MEAN THAT IT'S THAT THAT HAPPENS TO BE HAVE MECHANISMS IN PLACE IF WE GAVE THE MONEY NOW THE STILL STE CHECK OUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND THEY ACTUALLY DECIDE THE WARD OF BEFORE. I GUESS AND OF JUNE TWENTY TWENTY I MEAN. YEAH I MEAN ONE POSSIBILITY. WOULD BE TO ADD PROVISIONAL -- BUT YOUR BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD REQUIRE A NOTIFICATION OF THE LEGISLATURE IN APPROVAL BY THE LEGISLATURE AND BEFORE THE FUNDS ARE -- SPENT -- BEFORE THE FUNDS ARE PROVIDED TO THE DEPARTMENT TO SPEND ON IT PROJECT. OKAY THAT WOULD MEAN THAT ALL OF THIS IS ABOUT TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS A ROLE IN OVERSIGHT AND HAS MORE PRECISE INFORMATION ABOUT COST AND SCOPE INTO AND TIMELINE -- SO THE TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS A MECHANISM TO INVOLVED. THIS IS A THING ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE I MEAN WE WE TRUSTS. THE DEPARTMENT SO FORTH WE'RE NOT GONNA BE NIT PICKY ABOUT THE TECHNICAL SIDE BUT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WE HEAR FROM STAKEHOLDERS RIGHT WHEN THE FILE AND SOLICITATION COMES OUT SIGNALS A WAIT A MINUTE THIS THING IS GOING TO BE.

I MEAN I KNOW THE BIG GIANT WHEN WITH THE OTA SALAS TWENTY TWENTY THREE RIGHT NOW ALL THE PIECES WE WILL BRING THAT UP AGAIN -- BUT BUT BUT YOU KNOW THIS ONE THE I MEAN IT'S AN OLD SYSTEM AND WE'RE REPLACING IT AND IT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED BUT IT OBVIOUSLY AFFECTS ALL OF ALL HAVE AN EFFECT ON A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS AREA. YEAH AND JUST ONE MORE THING -- IS IS THAT YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT AND AS NOTED -- BY MISTER DOYLE THAT THERE WILL BE SOME EFFICIENCIES AND ADDITIONAL CLAIMING THAT WOULD BE -- ENABLED BY REPLACING THE SYSTEM AND TO THE EXTENT WE CAN GET THIS ONLINE SOONER THIS THE SOONER THAT THE DEPARTMENT CAN START RECOVERING THOSE COSTS OF F. B.. OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO WE'LL FIGURE THAT OUT FOR THE FINAL BUDGET TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN ALL BE ON THE SAME PAGE ON THAT. ALL RIGHT ANYTHING ELSE THAN ON THE SAN. OKAY THANKS AND THANK YOU SO MUCH ALWAYS APPRECIATE HAVING TO PARTY KNOWLEDGE HERE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IT CELL. THANK YOU. OKAY -- ISSUE NUMBER SIX IT'S THE OVERVIEW THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER CLOSURES AYE. YES THANK YOU A SENATOR PAN -- I I PROVIDED SOME -- CONTACTS A LITTLE BIT EARLIER BUT AGAIN JUST -- TO CHER AGAIN THAT -- WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO MOVING THE LAST INDIVIDUALS -- THAT HAVE BEEN PART OF THE CLOSURE THAT WAS ANNOUNCED IN -- TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN OF NOTE AGAIN THAT WE STARTED AT EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX AT THAT TIME CURRENTLY WE HAVE A CLUE -- ASIAN FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE PART OF OUR CULTURE -- FOR FAIRVIEW IMPORTER BILL TOGETHER IT'S A TOTAL OF NINETY TWO INDIVIDUALS -- I JUST KIND OF WANT TO SHARE ALSO THE EFFORT AND THE COMMITMENTS THAT EVERYBODY IS MADE IN DEVELOPING THE RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT THE INDIVIDUALS. AS FOCUSED ON RESIDENTIAL SERVICES FOCUSED ON SUNDAY SERVICES THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF THINGS ALSO SOME VERY UNIQUE THINGS HAS TO DO WITH MEDICAL WITH -- FQHCS AND AND LOOKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S AN EXPANSION OF SUPPORTS AND SERVICES -- WE DID HAVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESIDENTIAL HOMES FOR BOTH SO NO MATTER -- PORTERVILLE AND FAIRVIEW -- WE DEVELOPED A HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN HOMES AS PART OF THE CLOSURE. AND THAT PROVIDED A CAPACITY OF ABOUT -- SEVEN HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS SO COMING TO THE END OF THIS PROCESS -- WE'LL BE BACK NEXT YEAR AND THAT THAT TIME WILL PROBABLY BE REPORTING TO YOU THAT WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITIONED EVERYBODY TO THE COMMUNITY SO I DID JUST KIND OF WANT TO PROVIDE TO THAT UPDATE. THERE'S TWO QUESTIONS ON THE AGENDA -- TO DISCUSS THE STATUS OF THE LAND AND PROPERTY AND MISTER DOYLE WILL BE PROVIDING RESPONSES FOR THOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ARM SO WE JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE A BRIEF UPDATE ON THE THREE CENTERS THAT ARE CLOSING -- CINEMA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER -- IS. BUDGETED IN THE CURRENT YEAR. OUT TO HAVE JURISDICTION TURNED OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES ON JUNE THIRTIETH OF THIS YEAR -- THE PROPERTY IS CURRENTLY IN ONE SHUT DOWN. MEANING THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN THE CAMPUS -- WE CONTINUE TO OPERATE THE CENTRAL PLANT PROVIDE SECURITY AND FIRE SUPPRESSION SERVICES. HOWEVER THE ADMINISTRATION IN LEGISLATIVE MEMBERS REPRESENTING CINEMA COUNTY. RECENTLY REACHED AN AGREEMENT TO CONTINUE OPERATION OF CINNAMON IN A SIMILAR WARM SHUT DOWN FACE -- FOR A THREE YEAR PERIOD THAT WOULD END IN -- TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TGS WILL AS PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TAKEOVER JURISDICTION THE PROPERTY JULY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. BUT THE WILL ENTER INTO AN INTERAGENCY AGREEMENT WITH DDS WE'LL BE PROVIDING THE STAFF SUPPORT TO CONTINUE THE OPERATION OF THE THE CAMPUS -- DTS IS ALSO DURING THIS THREE YEAR PERIOD GOING TO BEGIN THE ADDITIONAL THE COMMISSION OF THE THE CAMPUS. THEY'RE GOING TO BE -- REMOVING FUEL STORAGE TANKS WE HAVE -- A FUEL STATIONS THAT ARE GONNA BE THAT NEED TO BE REMOVED. AND THEY'RE ALSO GOING TO BEGIN -- DEMOLISHING THE SWIMMING POOLS BECAUSE VAPE PRESENT BOTH A PUBLIC HEALTH VANDA A SAFETY RISK -- INTO SPRING FINANCE LETTER TO THE LEGISLATURE D. G. S. ESTIMATED THAT THE TOTAL COSTS FOR THE THREE YEAR PERIOD WOULD BE FORTY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION GENERAL FUND. AND WOULD REQUIRE THIRTY SIX POSITIONS IN SUPPORT. ON THE FORTY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR COST ALSO INCLUDES THREE POINT FIVE MILLION. A GENERAL FUND FOR CINEMA COUNTY TO CONDUCT UP ONE TIME LAND USE PLANNING PROCESS -- THEN AT FAIRVIEW DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER WE EXPECT THE LAST RESIDENT TO TRANSITION INTO COMMUNITY LIVING BY DECEMBER OF THIS YEAR. OF THE FAIRVIEW CAMPUS WILL GO INTO A SIMILAR WARM SHUT DOWN MODE EFFECTIVE. JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY AND WE PLAN TO TURN OVER JURISDICTION THE PROPERTY. OR AT LEAST PORTIONS OF IT TO D. G. S. EFFECTIVE JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY WE DO EXPECT TO RETAIN -- V.. PORTIONS OF THE CAMPUS THAT INCLUDE HARBOR VILLAGE WHICH IS A MIXED USE HOUSING COMMUNITY -- THE NEW A STABILIZATION TRAINING -- ASSISTANCE AND REINTEGRATION HOMES THE STAR HOMES. THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED ON MARK LANE. AND THEN THE TWENTY ACRE PROPERTY SIDE THAT. IS -- COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS SHANNON'S MOUNTAIN. SO WE WE INTEND TO RETAIN JURISDICTION OVER THOSE PORTIONS OF THE CAMPUS -- V. ARM. AS FAR AS PORTABLE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER. V. SECURE TREATMENT PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE ONE THAT'S THE THE PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES. SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS IN A HIGHLY STRUCTURED AND SECURE SETTING. AND IT WILL REMAIN IN OPERATION AFTER THE GENERAL TREATMENT AREA CLOSES -- WHICH WE EXPECT TO HAPPEN DURING THE SAME CALENDAR YEAR -- IN THE ADMINISTRATION IS CURRENTLY EXAMINING ALTERNATE USES FOR THE CAMPUS [inaudible] THE THE AGENDA ALSO ASKED FOR AN UPDATE ON SHANNON'S MOUNTAIN -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES ON BY DEVELOPING A PER WE'VE WE START WE ISSUED AN RFP FOR DEVELOPER. IN DECEMBER THERE WAS ONE DEVELOPER THAT SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL THE DEVELOPERS PROPOSAL WAS RESPONSIVE -- A END. IT WHEN IT WAS SCORED IT WAS IT WAS FOUND TO BE COMPLIANT WITH THE NEEDS OF THE THE PROJECT PROPOSAL -- BUT ON JANUARY FIFTEENTH OF THIS CURRENT YEAR. THE GOVERNOR ISSUED HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER -- ZERO SIX NINETEEN THAT'S THE ORDER THAT REQUIRES AMONG OTHER THINGS FOR D. G. S. TO CONDUCT. A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY OF STATE PROPERTY TO DETERMINE. BOB POSSIBLE USES FOR ON ALTERNATE HOUSING AND LOW INCOME HOUSING [inaudible] AND SO AS A RESULT THE CHANCE MOUNTAIN PROJECT IT HAS BEEN PUT ON HOLD. BUT THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS GOING ON WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION. TO OF LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING IT FORWARD. THANK YOU -- I JUST CLARIFY SHANNON'S MOUNTAIN IS A MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT THAT INCLUDE IT'S A YEAH IT'S INCLUDING SOME FOR DDS EXACTLY THAT'S RIGHT YEAH IT WOULD IT THE REQUIREMENT IS THAT AT LEAST. 20% OF THE UNITS WOULD BE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. SO ACTUALLY MAY ACTUALLY BE IN LINE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S GOALS FOR PRODUCING MORE HOUSING OKAY. COMMENTS FROM OHIO. WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TO ADD EXCEPT TO TO NOTE THAT WE JUST -- HAVE STARTED A REVIEW OF THE RECENT PROPOSAL AND THAT ACTUALLY FALLS UNDER DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES FOR THE CINEMA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER PROPERTY AND WE'RE STILL -- CONDUCTING COULD COLLECTING INFORMATION AND CONDUCTING ANALYSIS ON THAT BUT THREE OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE SORT OF TAKING A LOOK AT IS. ARE -- WHAT IS THE? OVERSIGHT ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE WHAT SORT OF PRECEDENTS -- MIGHT THIS APPROACH -- CREATE FOR THE FUTURE SUCH AS PAYING FOR LOCAL PLANNING COSTS -- AND THE THIRD ONE AND BEING JUST -- WE'RE TRYING TO GET SOME MORE BACK UP INFORMATION ABOUT THE THE SPECIFIC COSTS OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD. SO AND WHAT WE KNOW ONCE WE'VE CONDUCTED MORE ANALYSIS WILL BE SURE TO TO LET YOU KNOW. THANK YOU FINANCE. OKAY. AND INSTEAD WE HAVE A PANEL HERE WITH SOME STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS WE HAVE -- CARL LONDON WITH THE ALLIANCE FOR SUPPORTING PEOPLE WITH. NINETY DE AND OKAY. OKAY THERE YOU GO ALL RIGHT YOUR THE STAKEHOLDER FALLS. OKAY. WELCOME FULL PANEL. THANK YOU CENTER PAN -- I WAS OUT SPECIFICALLY TODAY BY A CENTER GROVE TO MAKE A COMMENT ON HER PROPOSAL WHICH SOMEWHAT RELATES TO THIS -- WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS -- SORT OF MAKE THE COMMENTS RELATED TO HER PROPOSAL AND THEN JUST MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS ON MY OWN IF YOU DON'T MIND -- I'M A LOBBYIST AS YOU MENTIONED FOR THE LINE SUPPORTING PEOPLE OF IDEA TO ORGANIZATION OF COMMUNITY BASED. ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA SERVICE POPULATION -- I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THAT POPULATION FOR APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN YEARS -- ALSO SERVED AS A BOARD MEMBER AND PAST PRESIDENT OF A LOCAL AGENCY FOR TEN YEARS. HERE IN THE SACRAMENTO REGION AND I'M ALSO THE FATHER OF A TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD WHO. IS GETTING READY TOLEAVE THE SYSTEM IN JUNE THAT THE SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT IS AND GO INTO THE ADULT SYSTEM HERE SO I HAVE A LOT OF RELATIVE EXPERIENCES -- RELATED TO THIS. CENTER GROWS PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY -- CALLED -- FOR SORT OF AN APPLICATION OF WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE PUT OUT IN THEIR STUDY WHERE THEY WERE ASKED TO LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF SAVINGS THAT MIGHT BE DERIVED. WHEN THE -- DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS ARE CLOSED. AND THE LA IS REPORT BASICALLY CAME OUT AND SAID THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THAT WOULD BE SAVED TO THE STATE ANNUALLY BY THE CLOSURE THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS. I THINK CENTER GROWS POSITION ON THAT IS -- IN LIGHT OF ALL OF THE RATE PROBLEMS WE HAVE IN THE STATE BE ISSUES THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT EARLIER SUCH AS THEY HAVE TO A BILLING THE HOLIDAY SCHEDULE SOCIAL WRECK CAMPS. WOULD BE GREAT IF WE COULD CAPTURE SOME OF THE SAVINGS AND MOVE IT OVER. TO THESE COMMUNITY PROGRAMS TO BOLSTER THEPROGRAMS. I THINK FURTHER -- CENTER GROVE IN HER CAUCUS HAS DEVELOPED A LETTER THAT I THINK YOU'VE SEEN. THAT PARALLELS THE LETTER THE YOU'VE ALSO PROBABLY RECEIVE FROM SENATOR STERN -- THERE ARE NOW SEVENTEEN MEMBERS OF THE SENATE THERE SUPPORTING THE PROPOSAL FOR AN 80% ACROSS THE BOARD RATE INCREASE FOR COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS AND THAT WAS PART OF CENTER GROCER QUESTIONS WELL. AND THEN -- THE LAST THING WAS -- OF COURSE RELATED TO THE THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER MOVING THAT SAVINGS. I THINK -- ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE COMMUNITY HAS AROUND THE US AND I THINK THIS IS SHARED BY SENATOR GROVE IS THE WE HAVE A LENGTHY HISTORY IN CALIFORNIA. OF SHUTTING DOWN THESE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS WHICH WERE LONG TIME NOW SAYS USED TO SERVE CALIFORNIANS WITHINTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND WHEN THEY'RE CLOSE THE LARGELY GO AWAY AND SO TO THE ASSETS AND THE OPERATING DOLLARS. JUST LOOKING BACKWARDS I'VE PULLED SOME FIGURES ON THIS. YOU KNOW DATING BACK. TO TWO THOUSAND SEVEN EIGHT THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS BUDGET IN CALIFORNIA SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS WE'RE SERVING -- JUST UNDER THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE BUT AS A BED PER BED COST ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PERSON. AND NOW WE'RE DOWN TO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY WITH A VERY LOW OPERATING BUDGET. AND ASSETS THAT ARE JUST DISAPPEARING WRITER FROM UNDER US. I THINK THE COMMUNITY MANY OF US IN THE COMMUNITY -- AND I THINK THIS IS SURE BY SENATOR BREAUX AND OTHERS. WOULD TAKE THE VIEW THAT WE HAVE ONE LAST TIME. TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN THE SYSTEM. WHILE WE ALL COMPLAIN ABOUT THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES FOR COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS IS NOT LOST ON A LOT OF US. WHO WE ARE AGAIN -- GOING TO A POSITION WHERE WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE. TO TREMENDOUS ASSETS IN THIS COMMUNITY ONE IN CINEMA. THAT'S BEEN IN THIS COMMUNITY SINCE THE EIGHTEEN NINETIES SERVING THIS POPULATION. AND THERE'S REALLY NOTHING. IN ANY OF THIS CLOSURE THAT BENEFITS THE COMMUNITY INSTEAD WERE FIGHTING FOR SOME OF THE ISSUES HERE EARLIER -- FIGHTING FOR RATE INCREASES AND HOPEFULLY GETTING SOME ASPECTS OF THE RATE STUDY -- IMPLEMENTED SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS AT LEAST OF NOTHING ELSE PUT IN A MARKER -- FOR THIS LEGISLATURE IN YOU TO CONSIDER AN ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY ON THIS. THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS IT'S NOT IN YOUR INTEREST IS NOT IN CENTER TITLES A TRUE INTEREST. IS NOT IN CENTER STONE'S INTEREST FOR THE CINEMA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER PROPERTY TO BE SIMPLY HANDED OVER TO CINEMA COUNTY AND THE LOCALS. THERE'S NO INTEREST FOR THIRTY SIX OTHER LEGISLATORS IN YOUR HOUSE. ON THAT PROPOSAL AND WE WOULD ASK YOU TO LOOK VERY CERTAINLY IN STRONGLY. AT POSSIBLY A DIFFERENT SOLUTION CAN BENEFIT THE SYSTEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU [inaudible] RIGHT [inaudible] SO I'D. RED DESIRE FROM PRE SHEET THAT PERSPECTIVE WE'VE HEARD THAT HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE -- WAY BEFORE WELL -- OVER CERTAINLY TIME I SERVED ON THIS COMMITTEE -- SO. I APPRECIATE CENTER GROOVES INTEREST I THINK WE'VE BEEN YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS FOR EVEN LONGER. THAN THAT -- AND CERTAINLY I THINK ILL WITH THAT'S THAT'S WHY WE'RE NOT HANDING OVER. CINEMA TO D. G. S. AND SAY ITSELF SURPLUS PROPERTY RIGHT THAT'S IN FACT I WOULD BE NOTE THAT THE COST OF KEEPING THIS IN THE SERVICE WARM SHUT DOWN IS ABOUT. ROUGHLY THE IT'S FOR FORTY SOME BILLION. DOLLARS RIGHT. CORRECT OVER THREE YOUR PEERS OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD SO AND THAT THAT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF OUR CAMP PROPOSAL WE THINK. AS WELL SO I MEAN THAT'S WHAT WAS THAT FOR SOME OF THAT MONEY IS GOING -- ALSO I JUST MAKE NOTE THAT IN THE OVERVIEW -- SO WOULD YES WE HAVE REDUCTION IN STATE OPERATED RESIDENTIAL COMMITTEE FACILITIES. THE SO THERE'S A REDUCTION -- HERE OF EIGHTY FOUR WELL. EIGHTY FOUR MILLION -- HERE BUT I ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT THE INCREASE AND WHAT'S BUDGET FOR COMMITTEE SERVICES UP FIVE FIVE HUNDRED SIX MILLION SO MANY FOLD. LARGER THAN THE REDUCTION SO WE ARE PUTTING MORE MONEY IN -- IT SO EVEN THOUGH THE SO THERE'S A DROP THAT THE DROP IS A FRACTION OF THE INCREASE. SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE SHOULD PUT MORE AND I THINK IT WILL HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE RATE STUDY AND AND I HEAR WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING. BUT I ALSO WANT TO JUST. DEL BIG KNOWLEDGE THAT IT'S NOT THAT THE MONEY'S GOING DOWN HERE AND WE'RE NOT PUTTING WE'RE NOT PROPOSING THE GOVERNOR HAS A PROPOSED AND I THINK THAT'S LEGISLATORS IN PROPOSING PUTTING -- NOT JUST THE SAME BUT EVEN MORE MONEY AND THEN WERE REDUCING -- WITH THE WITH SOME OF THE SHUTDOWN BUT I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I WILL CERTAINLY WE WANT. TO KEEP IN MIND THOSE ASSETS AYE AYE I THINK WHAT WE WANT TO TRY TO DO. IS -- AND AND I AGREE WE PRIDE HAVE NOT DONE AS GOOD A JOB IN DOING THIS IS FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE RIGHT AMOUNT RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WHAT'S THE RIGHT AMOUNT WHAT'S YOU KNOW AND WERE BEHIND ON THAT. AND THAT'S WHY WE FOR THOSE PROPOSALS. AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THEM THE MORE POURTANT THING THAT I THINK WE WANT TO TRY. TO ACHIEVE -- AND CERTAINLY SOME ONE WAY TO TRY TO GET THERE IS THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE ASSETS THAT WE ALL HAVE AN THAT WE'RE TRANSITIONING BECAUSE OF A DIFFERENT DIRECTION WE'RE GOING. SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT BUT CERTAIN I HOPE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT LIMITING. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS SIMPLY BEING WHILE WE SHUT DOWN THIS AND THAT'S THE ONLY AMOUNT OF MONEY WE SHIFT OVER AND DAY APPRECIATE THAT AND THIS AT LEAST THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL? THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PUT FORWARD THAT IS ACTUALLY A LOT MORE MONEY GOING IN THE AND IS THEN JUST THE MONEY THAT WE'RE SAVING -- AND AND AND BASICALLY AS WERE SHUTTING DOWN WHAT WE MOVED EVERYONE OUT OF CINEMA AND ALSO WERE TRANSITIONING PEOPLE OUT OF FOR PHIL AND WHAT'S. THE OTHER ONE YEAH SO YEAH I I I THINK THE ONLY ALL OF BY BECAUSE THAT SENATORS THAT -- AS WE'RE LOOKING AT WE'RE GOING TO DRAW THE FUNDS TO SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED TODAY AND IT WILL BE ON YOUR AGENDA NEXT WEEK. WE THINK THIS SHOULD BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. AND I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT A LOT OF THE MONEY THAT -- YOU'RE% TALKING ABOUT THAT IMPROVES THE FIGURE FOR COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS. AS DEDICATED CASELOAD GROWTH THERE'S AN AWFUL A CASELOAD GROWTH BUT THE RATES HAVEN'T RISEN SO THAT MEANS THE QUALITY LEVEL SERVICES AVAILABILITY STILL REMAINS WHERE IT IS. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HAVING THE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS YOU'RE HEARING FROM THE COMMUNITY EVERY SINGLE DAY YEAH THANK YOU VERY SO SO NO I APPRECIATE THAT BUT I I HOPE THAT WE CAN FRAME THE DISCUSSION IS NOT SIMPLY UP WELL THAT'S BECAUSE OTHERWISE ACTUALLY BE EVEN. WORSE OFF RIGHT IF WE ONLY SAID THE ONLY AMOUNT OF MONEY WE'RE CAN BE TALKING ABOUT IS THE ASSETS FROM THIS BEING TRANSFERRED OVER AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S THE RIGHT AMOUNT AND THE FACT IS PROUD TO BE MORE MUCH MORE THAN WE'RE JUST GOING TO GET BEAUSE OF CASE. LOAD GROWTH AND OTHER TYPES OF ISSUES RIGHT AND CERTAINLY YOU KNOW SAID VERY SUPPORTIVE OF ME THE PROPOSALS THAT WE'RE HEARING HERE TODAY SO -- SO ANYWAY OKAY NO THANK YOU THANK YOU AND APPRECIATE YOUR ADVOCACY YEAH THANK YOU. OKAY. ANY OTHER COMMENTS ON THAT RIGHT SO LET'S -- OKAY SO LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER. SEVEN JUST SAFETY NET CITIES IN CRISIS SERVICES AND ACTUALLY JUST TO MAKE NOTES I KNOW THAT IN THE AGENDA IS ACTUALLY -- IT'S IS MARK THIS INFORMATION THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY NOT JUST INFORMATIONAL THIS IS ACTUALLY PROPOSAL CITING WHY KNOWLEDGE THAT -- IF YOU FOR PEOPLE LOOKING AT THE AGENDA THAT WAS MISLABELLED SIMPLY INFORMATIONAL THIS IS ACTUALLY -- A A PROPOSAL SO. LET'S. BEGIN WITH -- THE SO WE'RE GONNA GET HAVE THE AGENCY PRESENT AND THEN WE DO HAVE A PANEL. AS WELL IS GONE PROVIDE COMMENTS ON THE DEPARTMENT SAFETY NET PLANNING CRISIS SERVICES SO. ALL RIGHT AND O'DONNELL SHUFFLING HERE AT THE TABLE HERE OKAY. OKAY WE'RE GETTING SETTLED INTO AREA. WANT TO MAKE ROOM. ABSOLUTELY ALL RIGHT SOME INTEREST HERE SO THANK THAT WELCOME AT THANK YOU -- I'VE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON OUR SAFETY NET -- PLAN AND THEN ANSWERS SOME SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT ARE OUTLINED ON THE AGENDA -- SO THE GENDER -- CORRECTLY ON PAGE THIRTY ONE PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSAL THAT -- WE'VE PUT FORWARD FOR EXPANSION OF THE SAFETY NET SUPPORTS AND CRISIS SERVICES TOTAL FUND IS ELEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION WITH GENERAL FUND OF SEVEN POINT THREE MEN -- MILLION. THE THE REQUESTED -- HERE -- POINTS -- TO TO DDS OPERATED CRISIS HOMES WHICH WOULD BE -- FOCUSED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAN ALSO ADDING A THIRD MOBILE CRISIS TEAM WHICH WOULD BE -- IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- CALLED CAST AND THIS IS THE THIRD OUT OF THE THE OTHER TWO THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED ONE IN THE NORTH AND ONE IN THE SOUTH. AND THEN IT ADDS -- THREE POINT TWO MILLION IS A REQUEST FOR TOTAL FUND TWO POINT SIX FOR GENERAL FUND FOR ON GOING FOR THE TWENTY SEVEN NEW POSITIONS -- THAT WOULD BE STAFF BEING THE THIRD -- STAR HOME THAT IS SCHEDULED TO OPEN IN THE FALL OF TWENTY NINETEEN SO THIS IS A PRIOR APPROVAL OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE THIRD HOME THAT I TALKED ABOUT IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD BE IN THE COMMUNITY FOR THE STATE OPERATED ACUTE CRISIS SERVICES. AND THEN THERE'S THE ADDITIONAL REQUEST -- FOR THE NINE POSITIONS FOR THE OVERSIGHT OF THE SAFETY THE STAR HOMES AND THE CAST HOMES SO IT'S JUST TAKING A LOOK AT NOW THAT WE'RE MOVING TO THE COMMUNITY. THAT WE NO LONGER HAVE THE PRESENCE OF THE STAFFING THAT WAS AT THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE -- TO HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT IS STRUCTURED DIFFERENTLY IN THE COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE THOSE SUPPORTS. SO I'D I'D LIKE TO JUST GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF AN UPDATE -- ON WHERE WE ARE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE HOMES THAT WE HAVE -- HAD APPROVAL IN THE PAST IT'S BEEN PART OF THE SAFETY NET BEFORE THAT THOUGH I'D LIKE TO JUST KIND OF SHARE THAT WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT OUR SAFETY NET. AND WE REALLY START SAFETY NET PLAN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND THAT WAS INFORMED BY QUITE A BIT OF STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT DISCUSSIONS AND IT REALLY WAS IN RESPONSE OF SAYING THAT WE ARE CLOSING THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AND SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS IN A DIFFERENT WAY IN THE COMMUNITY. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO EXPAND THAT SERVICE THAT TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE SOME VERY UNIQUE AND COMPLEX NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY -- SO WE'VE WE'VE BEEN VERY BUSY. THE REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE BEEN BUSY AND THE DOCTOR BACKSTROM AND HIS STAFF HAVE BEEN VERY BUSY AND DEVELOPING SOME OF THE RESOURCES SO I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE YOU A SUMMARY OF THAT. SO WITH THE TWO THE HOME STARTING -- AS I SAID IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE ARE OPENING AND THAT THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS AND MOVING THE INDIVIDUALS WE DO HAVE TO ADDITIONAL HOMES THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE DEVELOPING A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR THE STATE OPERATED STAR -- WE HAVE ONE HOME THAT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED IN MORE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THE RENOVATION SO THIS YEAR WE WOULD BE ABLE TO GO AHEAD AND SEE THE OPERATION OF THAT. THAT HOME WERE IN SEARCH OF THE THIRD HOME SO WE ARE PROBABLY A BIT IT WAY FROM BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES FOR THE THIRD. I Q. CRISIS ON THAT STATE OPERATE IN THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH WE ALSO HAVE THE SEVEN CALIPHATE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE AT FAIRVIEW THE THE TWO HOMES ARE GOING TO BE AN OPERATION ONE IS GOING. TO SUPPORT THE FIVE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE AT FAIRVIEW PRESENTLY THAT WILL BE GOING INTO THEIR QUEUE CRISIS. AND THEN THE OTHER ONE WILL BE ADDED CAPACITY THAT WILL BE -- ABLE TO OFFER -- SO WE'RE GOING TO BE DEVELOPING AT ON MARK LANE WE'RE JUST TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROPERTY AT FAIRVIEW SO MARK LANE IS GOING TO HAVE A GROUND UP CONSTRUCTION OF THESE TWO HOMES. WE ALSO IN THE SAFETY NET PLAN HAD DEVELOPED -- HOME TO BE OPEN FOR HOMES TO BE A STEP DOWN HOME FOR THE INDIVIDUALS IN THE SECURE TREATMENT PROGRAM AT PORTER BILL -- WE HAVE EXT SO THREE HOMES THERE'S THREE HOMES THERE I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. ALL THREE ARE ACTUALLY IN ESCROW -- IN DEVELOPMENT -- HEATHER FLORES IS HERE -- FROM CENTRAL VALLEY AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO THEIR EFFORTS AND HELPING US IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE HOMES -- THE SECURE TREATMENT INTENSIVE WRAPAROUND SERVICE -- WE WERE ABLE TO ACTUALLY START THE SECURE TREATMENT WRAPAROUND SERVICES SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS A CONTRACT THROUGH THE STATE. SO WE HAVE CONTRACTED WITH LIBERTY I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT WE STARTED THE SERVICE AND THIS IS INTENDED TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS MOVING FROM THE SECURE TREATMENT. TO THE COMMUNITY -- THEY'RE WORKING WITH NINE INDIVIDUALS WE WILL HAVE THE FIRST PERSON THAT IS AN BE TRANSITIONING TO THE COMMUNITY WITH THE SUPPORT OF THIS NEW NEWLY DEFINED PROGRAM. WE ALSO HAVE A FOCUS AND WE HAVE -- FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS TAKING A LOOK AT HOW DO WE START ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE AN INSTITUTION FOR MENTAL DISEASES I AM DAYS WITH WELL OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE. AS FAR AS INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN I AM DIS HOWEVER WE HAVE QUITE A FEW INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN AND RESIDING AT I. M. D. -- FOR SOME FOR FOUR YEARS FIVE YEARS SO IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES A SAFETY NET PLAN WAS -- PRESENTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF STEPPED DOWN HOMES -- THERE FOR HOMES THERE'S ONE TWO IN THE SOUTH -- ONE IN THE IN THE NORTH THAT AL TO REGIONAL CENTER AND THE ONE FURTHER NORTH OF FAR NORTHERN REGIONAL CENTER ALL HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED IN THE FIRST ONE IS GOING TO BE OPEN AND ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS. ARE MOVING IN JUNE THIS IS GOING TO PROVIDE A CAPACITY FOR SIXTEEN INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE PRESENTLY AND I AM DES CURRENTLY WE HAVE A OF JUST SHY OF SIXTY INDIVIDUALS. THAT ARE CURRENTLY AND I AM DAYS AT THIS TIME. ANOTHER IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS MOVING FROM THE MORE RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS -- IS A WRAPAROUND SERVICE AND THE SERVICE ALSO HAS STARTED A MORE HAPPY TO SAY THAT THIS INTENSIVE SUPPORT SERVICE THAT IS OPERATED INVENTED BY -- L. TO REGIONAL CENTER IN ST GBRIEL POMONA REGIONAL CENTER THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH NINETEEN INDIVIDUALS -- TO SUPPORT THEM IN THEIR EFFORTS TO MOVE FROM AND I AM DE TO THE COMMUNITY -- IN THE REQUEST THAT WE HAVE AND PART OF THE SAFETY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SAFETY NET PLAN I FREQUENTLY SAY THAT -- DEVELOPING THE SAFETY NET PLAN IS NOT AN EVENT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO DO ON GOING WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THOSE NEEDS. SO WE HAVE A PROPOSAL TO DEVELOP TO ADDITIONAL -- STAR HOMES AS I SAID IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AND THEN THE MOBILE CRISIS TEAM -- IN IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AS WELL JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU HOW WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING TO TO IDENTIFY WHY WE HAVE THAT NEED. AND WHY WE THE QUESTION HAS COME UP A COUPLE OF TIMES HOW DO WE PICK CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WHY IS THAT THE PLACE THAT WE NEED TO BE. WELL WHEN WE'VE LOOKED AT ON THE DATA BUT WE ALSO KNOW OUR STORE SERVICES YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ONE EXACTLY AND EVERY LOCATION BUT WE DO KNOW THAT IF THERE'S INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NEED SOME SERVICES WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE STATE OPERATED. STAR SERVICES OUR STATE OPERATED MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES THAT THERE'S THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH THERE'S A BIG CHUNK OF CALIFORNIA THAT IS IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA -- WE DO KNOW THAT I AM DES THAT COULD RECEIVE SERVICES -- AS A PREVENTATIVE MEASURE -- IN THESE HOMES AND THE SERVICE 11% OF THEM ARE IN THE CENTRAL REGION THAT IS BY FOUR DIFFERENT REGIONAL CENTERS LIVING OUT OF STATE AT THIS POINT -- ARE ALSO WITHIN THAT CENTRAL REGION WHILE IT MAY NOT BE A LARGE NUMBER WE'D STILL HAVE SOME INDIVIDUALS THAT -- ARE ARE IN NEED OF SERVICES THAT ARE VERY COMPLEX AND THIS WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY. 15% OF THE REFERRALS THAT -- WE HAVE TO OUR STAR HOMES SO WE HAVE A HUNDRED pHAD SINCE THE INCEPTION OF OUR STAR HOMES. THIRTY INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN FROM THOSE FOUR DIFFERENT REGIONAL CENTERS THAT ARE WITHIN KIND OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY. SO AND RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE AN ACUTE CRISIS MOBILE TEAM THAT IS A STATE OPERATED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. SO IN ADDITION WE HAVE A COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO EXPAND AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THOSE LATER BUT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE NOTE THAT. THE EFFORT TO EXPAND THE CHILDREN COMMUNITY CRISIS HOMES AND AND THE THE REGIONAL CENTER SERVICE COORDINATOR RATIO TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS WITH COMPLEX NEEDS WITH THE ONE TO TWENTY FIVE ALL OF THAT REALLY DOES GET. TO OUR EFFORTS IN MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE BEING VERY MINDFUL OF CONTINUING OUR EFFORTS TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS -- WITH THAT HAVE KIND OF GROWING COMPLEX NEEDS WITH A CO OCCURRING -- THAT CERTAINLY IS A CHALLENGE FOR SYSTEM. THANK YOU ARE COMING FROM ALEJO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- WE'D FOR SAY THAT WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE WHAT DIRECTOR BRIDGEMAN SAID ABOUT THE SAFETY NET BEING MORE OF A PROCESS THAN A SINGULAR EVENT -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT -- IS GOING TO BE AN ONGOING. ISSUE FOR THE SYSTEM AN ON GOING CONCERN -- IT WAS ALSO NICE TO HEAR SOME OF THE STATISTICS ABOUT THE DEMAND IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT'S THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HEARD THOSE STATISTICS AND THAT FOR ME OUR MAIN POINT IS THAT THERE'S SORT OF A LACK OF COMPREHENSIVE DATA TO UNDERSTAND THE DEMAND FOR CRISIS SERVICES IN THE STATE. GENERALLY. WE DON'T OUR OFFICE DOES NOT -- DISAGREE WITH THE FACT THAT THERE IS. A LIKELY A NEED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT'S THE YOU KNOW WHEN THE ORIGINAL AND SAFETY NET PLAN CAME OUT THAT SEEM TO BE THE AREA THAT WAS. MISSING - SOME STATE OR IN SERVICES -- HOWEVER ARE OUR ULTIMATE RECOMMENDATION IS -- TO WE RECOMMEND TO THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOP -- AN UPDATE TO THEIR OVERALL SAFETY NET PLAN -- PERHAPS SUBMITTED WITH THEIR BUDGET -- NEXT YEAR AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS WOULD TO BE TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF OF HOW THE DEPARTMENT IS LOOKING AT THE DEMAND FOR SERVICES -- WHAT SERVICES DO REGIONAL CENTERS PROVIDE AID AND HOW CAN THOSE SERVICES BE UTILIZED TO PREVENT CRISES FROM EVEN ARISING -- AND THEN -- THE OBVIOUSLY THE THE STATE HAS INVESTED A LOT OF DOLLARS INTO DEVELOPING THESE NEW. MODELS OF HOMES IN THE COMMUNITY AND IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO HAVE A SENSE OF HOW ARE THEY WORKING WATER -- THE LESSONS LEARNED HOW DO WE PLAN TO EVALUATE -- THOSE SERVICES ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND THEN JUST A FINAL COMMENT -- WE DID HAVE RAISED SOME QUESTIONS IN OUR BUDGET ANALYSIS ABOUT PLACING THE CENTRAL VALLEY HOMES IN NEAR THE PART OF BILL DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER. THAT MIGHT MAKE A LOT OF SENSE IN THE VERY NEAR TERM BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME STAFF FROM THE PORTABLE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER THAT. WOULD BE WELL QUALIFIED TO RUN THESE HOMES BUT WE DO. HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SORT OF REMOTE LOCATION OF PORTER VILLE IN TERMS OF SERVING THE BROADER -- COMMUNITY GOING FORWARD AND IN TERMS OF RECRUITING STAFF TO WORK IN THOSE HOMES IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU COMES FROM FINANCE. OKAY THANK YOU AND WE HAVE A PANEL HERE IS GONNA. ADDRESS THIS AND ALSO I BELIEVE -- I'LL SEE I THINK YOU HAVE A PROPOSALS WHILE I BELIEVE -- FROM THIS BILLY RIGHT SO WITH HEATHER FLOOR IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FROM CENTRAL VALLEY REGIONAL CENTER AND GROOM BALL AND KATHERINE BLAKE MORE SO LET'S GO AHEAD LET'S GO BEGIN WITH A SORE AS A ASK IF YOU CAN TRY TO KEEP YOUR MARKS WITHIN THREE MINUTES. THANK YOU I'LL DO MY BEST THANK YOU SENATOR POUND. AND DISTINGUISH STUFF IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE UP HERE -- SO IT IS DIFFICULT TO DISCUSS AN ISSUE OF THIS MAGNITUDE IN THREE MINUTES -- BUT LET ME PAINT A PICTURE FOR YOU AS CENTRAL VALLEY REGIONAL CENTER WE SERVE TWENTY ONE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WITH A CURRENT GROWTH RATE OF 7%. WE REPRESENT ABOUT 6% OF THE INDIVIDUAL SERVICE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE HISTORICALLY RECEIVE AN AVERAGE OF THREE CRISIS CALLS PER NIGHT -- LAST NIGHT WE RECEIVED THREE CRISIS CALLS IN ONE NIGHT I'M SO WE'RE STARTING TO SEE AN INCREASE IN THESE CRISIS CALLS AT NIGHT TIME -- WHICH GIVES US ON AVERAGE RIGHT NOW ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX CRISIS CALLS -- PER YEAR -- BUT INCREASING OVER TIME WE ALSO HAVE A LIST OF INDIVIDUALS WERE CHALLENGING TO SERVE -- WHO HAVE -- HISTORICAL ISSUES WITH HIGH ACUITY BEHAVIORS ARE CHALLENGES ARE MEDICAL NEEDS -- AND THEN PERIODS WHERE THEY'RE DOING OKAY AND WE CAN ENGAGE IN SPECIALIZED THERAPEUTIC RESOURCES -- SO IF YOU EXTRAPOLATE THOSE NUMBERS OUT TO THE STATE WIDE. IS OUT TO ABOUT THIRTY NINE HUNDRED PEOPLE -- STATEWIDE -- THAT THAT ARE PROBABLY IN CRISIS OVER TIME YOU KNOW SOME WITH HIGH ACUITY AND SOME JUST WITH MORE CHRONIC SITUATIONS. SO OUR RECOMMENDATION AT THIS TIME AS A REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM IS AS SIGNIFICANT START UP FUNDING FROM THE COMMUNITY RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT PLAN. IS DESPERATELY NEEDED TO CREATE CRISIS AND LONG TERM RESIDENTIAL OPTIONS WITH APPROPRIATE CARE AND TREATMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH THE MOST CHALLENGING NEEDS. WE KNOW THAT THE HOUSING MODELS OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER CLOSURE HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE SUCH AS THE ENHANCE BEHAVIORAL SUPPORT HOMES AND THE OUR FISSIONS THE ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES FOR PERSONS WITH SPECIAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS -- HOWEVER IS THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR NEED INCREASES ARE WORRIED RESOURCES ARE NOT CURRENTLY KEEPING UP -- WE WOULDN'T RECOMMEND FRONT LOADING CAPACITY NOW OUT OF THE C. R. D. US -- AND THEN RELEASING THAT DOWN THE ROAD ONCE WE HAVE ACHIEVED CAPACITY FOR THESE HIGH ACUITY SITUATIONS -- THIS ALSO INCREASES THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS -- FOR INDIVIDUALS SERVED AND FAMILIES -- AS WELL I'M A BETTER SUPPORT FOR THEM AND INDIVIDUAL CHOICE. BUILDING A BETTER OUTCOMES FOR FOLKS. SO I JUST WANNA SURE AT LEAST ONE POSITIVE STORY WITH YOU BECAUSE IT ON THE T. MARK. WE HAVE ONE INDIVIDUAL SO IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE HAVE TWO OF THE SPECIALIZED HOMES WERE THE FIRST IN THE STATE WE WERE THE FIRST IN THE STATE TO DEVELOP THEM SOMEONE WAS THAT A LADY CROSS SECURE PERIMETER HOME. WE HAVE A FELLOW IN THERE WITH DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER TODAY. AND HE SUICIDAL IDEATION ESPECIALLY AROUND THE TIME OF HIS CAR ACCIDENT ALL THESE SORTS OF THINGS -- YOU KNOW AND ALL THE REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE STORIES LIKE THIS. BUT THIS YOUNG MAN IS NOW MENTORING HIS PEERS -- USING HIS COPING SKILLS TO TEACH OTHERS COPING SKILLS AROUND HIS SITUATION AND ACTUALLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON OTHER PEOPLE AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T KNOW THAT HE WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE BEFORE SO IT REALLY WONDERFUL OUTCOMES -- WE DO AS REGIONAL CENTERS IN A SOMETIMES PEOPLE GET A LITTLE CONFUSING THEY THINK I CAN'T I JUST AS A FAMILY MEMBER CALL THE STATE DIRECTLY -- THE RELATIONSHIP IS WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER WE DO SERVE THROUGHOUT THE LIFESPAN AND THERE'S SOME CONFUSION SOMETIMES BUT THE IPPV. WHICH IS AN EVENT -- ANYWAY I'LL STOP TALKING ABOUT THAT PART. SO -- ANYWAY FAMILIES NEED A BROADER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT REGIONAL CENTERS CAN DO WHEN THEY'RE CRISIS AND THERE'S A MISPERCEPTION BUT STAFF ARE -- ONLY SEE FAMILIES ANNUALLY -- BUT WITH THIS ISSUE OF CAPACITY WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE C. R. T. F. MEME MONEY BE FRONT LOADED WE WOULD LIKE TO COMMEND -- DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA FOR THE FIVE MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST -- AND ALSO THE DEPARTMENT FOR THE ONE TO TWENTY FIVE CASELOADS AND AB TWO ZERO EIGHT THIRTY THREE FOR THE COURT NAY TO CARE FOR FOSTER YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. ABOUT GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ANNA GROUP LAW AND I AM THE MOTHER OF KYLE BAKER A CLIENT OF NORTH BAY REGIONAL CENTER. KYLE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM JUST PRIOR TO HIS THIRD BIRTHDAY AND IS NON VERBAL HE TURNS SIXTEEN THIS LAST. DECEMBER INSTEAD OF SPENDING HIS BIRTHDAY AT HOME WITH HIS FAMILY. HE SPENT IT AT THE Q. CRISIS UNIT AT FAIRVIEW DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER IN ORANGE COUNTY. HE IS THE ONLY MINOR LIVING IN A TO CALIFORNIA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER SO COMPLETELY SEPARATE UNIT WAS CREATED FOR HIM AWAY FROM THE ADULTS WHO LIVE THERE. EXCEPT FOR THE MANY STAFF WHO CARE FOR HIM HE SPENDS MUCH OF HIS DAYS ALONE IN HIS ROOM. WHICH HE LIKES TO KEEP DARK HE USUALLY ONLY LEAVES HIS ROOM TO USE THE BATHROOM BASIN AND EAT HIS MEALS. I AM ABLE TO VISIT HIM ONCE A MONTH SINCE I LIVE AND WORK IN CINEMA COUNTY. HE DOES NOT RECEIVE BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT SPEECH THERAPY OR EDUCATIONAL SERVICES TO SPEAK OF AND I FEAR HIS COGNITIVE AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS HAVE REGRESSED. HIS GIVEN FIVE SEPARATE PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS INCLUDING FOR PSYCHOSIS AND SEIZURES NEITHER OF WHICH HE HAS. AND MOST OF HIS MEDICATIONS -- AT OR HIGHER THAN THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGES FERN JOLT EXCUSE ME. SOMETIMES HE TRIES TO HURT THE STAFF AND IS GIVEN ADDITIONAL MEDICATIONS ARE PUT INTO RESTRAINTS YOU MAY BE WONDERING HOW KYLE ENDED UP IN THIS SITUATION. AFTER KYLE ENTERED PUBERTY HE ENGAGED IN MORE INTENSE. AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIORS TOWARDS HIMSELF OTHERS AND PROPERTY. IN EARLY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MY HUSBAND KYLE'S FATHER NEIL SORRY. AND I COULD NO LONGER TAKE CARE OF KYLE SAFELY IN OUR HOME. NEIL WAS KYLE'S I'D JUST US CARE PROVIDER AND HAD STAYED AT HOME WITH HIM. FOR MUCH OF HIS LIFE IN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN KYLE'S AGGRESSION ESCALATED HE ATTACKED. AND OUR RESPITE CARE PROVIDER AND WE CALLED. NINE ONE ONE BECAUSE THERE WAS NOWHERE ELSE FOR HIM TO GO NO PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL WOULD TAKE HIM BECAUSE OF HIS DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY. AND THERE WERE NO APPROPRIATE COMMUNITY PLACEMENTS KYLE AGE FIFTEEN WAS ADMITTED TO A REGULAR MEDICAL HOSPITAL ON AN ADULT FLOOR. WHERE HE REMAINED FOR MUCH OF THE NEXT TEN MONTHS [inaudible] SORRY -- RATHER THAN RECEIVING THERAPEUTIC TREATMENT HE SPENT THE MAJORITY OF THAT TIME IN BED HEAVILY MEDICATED AND AND FOUR POINT RESTRAINTS TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. CAUSING HIM MUSCLE ATROPHY IMPACTING HIS ABILITY TO WALK OR EVEN STAND UNDER ITS OWN WEIGHT. HE WAS PRESCRIBED HIGH DOSES OF PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS TO SEDATE HIM AS HE INJURED NUMEROUS MEDICAL STUFF SECURITY GUARDS AND HIMSELF. HE SUFFERED FROM SIGNIFICANT MEDICAL PROBLEMS AS SIDE EFFECTS OF THOSE MEDICATIONS AT ONE POINT HE DEVELOPED SEPSIS AND SPENT TEN DAYS IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT. UNDER COMPLETE SEDATION. THE HOSPITAL FOUND A RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR HIM IN MAY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUT HE WAS KICKED OUT AFTER SIXTEEN HOURS AND VERY SOON. RETURN TO THE HOSPITAL. OUR FAMILY WAS REPEATEDLY THREATENED WITH AND REPORTED TO CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES BY HOSPITAL STAFF BECAUSE WE WERE UNABLE TO MEET KYLE'S NEEDS AT HOME. ON JULY TENTH. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHEN KYLE REMAINED IN THE HOSPITAL. NEIL DIED SUDDENLY FROM A HEART ATTACK. I SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT HIS GRIEF AND STRESS ABOUT PILE SITUATION. PLAYED A ROLE IN HIS EARLY DEATH AT AGE. FIFTY FIVE I STILL HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO BRING MYSELF TO TELL KYLE. NOT WHEN HIS ALONE SO FAR AWAY FROM ME. AFTER UNSUCCESSFUL STATEWIDE SEARCHES BY THE REGIONAL CENTER DDS APPROVED A RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL PLACEMENT IN KANSAS WHICH FELL THROUGH MAYOR DAYS. BEFORE HIS PLANNED ADMISSION IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN APOLOGIZE I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU TO WRAP OKAY I'M ALMOST I'M ALMOST DONE SO -- OF A SO REGIONAL CENTER IDENTIFIED OF A SO CALLED CRISIS HOME IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUT THE PROGRAM WAS CLEARLY NOT PREPARED TO MEET HIS NEEDS. WITHIN A FEW DAYS OF PLACEMENT THERE KYLE SLAMMED HIS HEAD INTO A SLIDING GLASS DOOR RE OPENING A HEAD WOUND THAT HE HAD SUFFERED IN THE HOSPITAL AND BREAKING THE DOOR. THE HOME CALLED NINE ONE ONE AND REFUSED TO ALLOW HIM TO RETURN HE SPENT TWO WEEKS STRAPPED TO A GURNEY AND AN ER. HOURS AWAY FROM ME BEFORE HE WAS FINALLY TRANSFERRED TO THE ACUTE CRISIS UNIT AT FAIRVIEW WHERE HE CURRENTLY LIVES. I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND TO SHARE KYLE STORY WITH YOU I HOPE THAT KYLE'S EXPERIENCES AND ALL THAT HE IS AN TOWARD. WILL BE TO SOME MEANINGFUL CHANGE THAT CAN HELP KYLE AND MANY ADOLESCENTS IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS. I'D LIKE TO THANK SENATOR MIKE MCGUIRE AND DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA FOR THEIR SUPPORT OF KYLE AND OUR FAMILY DURING THIS. SITUATION THE THING THIS IS KYLE'S PICTURE OKAY. THANK YOU KNOW TOOK THE LAST VISIT. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING THIS STORY. THANK YOU. I THINK THAT POINTS OUT WHY WE'RE HERE. AND I'M NOT REALLY SURE HOW. TO SORT OF BRING THAT TOGETHER TAUGHT TO TALK ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA THINKS -- ME TO HAPPEN BUT I'M GONNA TRYING TO THAT BRIEFLY FIRST WE AGREE WITH THE LA -- ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF TAKING A STEP BACK TO SAY WHAT ELSE DO WE NEED IN CALIFORNIA WHAT ARE THE UNMET NEEDS -- WHAT ADDITIONAL KINDS OF PLACEMENTS OR SERVICES MIGHT INSURE THAT WE CAN BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SERVED BY THE REGIONAL CENTER? I THINK THAT MEANS LOOKING AT HEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVERS AND SORT OF RATES AND ALL OF THAT THAT GOES INTO THAT SO WE CAN -- BEST SERVE BEST SERVE PEOPLE SO I WANT. TO ENCOURAGE THAT THAT RECOMMENDATION -- I WANT TO SPEAK BRIEFLY BEFORE YOU DO THAT I I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE -- THE REALLY TREMENDOUS WORK THAT HAS DONE BEEN DONE BY THE DEPARTMENT AND THE REGIONAL CENTERS. BOTH TO CLOSE THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS ARE VERY CLOSE TO CLOSING THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS HAVE BEEN WORKING IN THE SYSTEM FOR A LONG TIME AND IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE REMARKABLE THAT WE ARE WE ARE AND AND TO THINK ALL THE HARD WORK THAT HAS HAPPENED. TO TO BEGIN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMUNITY. OF CRISIS -- US SERVICE SYSTEM -- SO THE FIRST THING I WANT TO SAY IS WE CURRENTLY HAVE STATE OPERATED CRISIS TEAMS WHICH ARE TERRIFIC WE NEED TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY OF THOSE CRISIS TEAMS TO SERVE PEOPLE STATEWIDE. IT SHOULDN'T FOR FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF SECURITY IN CRISIS WE NEED TO HAVE THAT COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT FOR ALL OF THEM AND WE'RE NOT THERE YET. ON THE SECOND IS WE ARE PROPOSING CRISIS CAPACITY FOR CHILDREN ADOLESCENTS THAT WILL SERVE PRECISELY TWELVE INDIVIDUALS I THINK. THREE HOMES. IS IN SUFFICIENT WEEK. WE HAVE ONE IN THE FAR NORTH ONE IN THE CENTRAL WHICH I THINK IS GREAT AND ONE IN THE SOUTH BUT IT WILL MEAN. THAT CHILDREN WHO ARE IN CRISIS ARE MOVED LONG DISTANCES FROM THEIR FAMILIES TO RECEIVE THOSE SERVICES FOR UP TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT EXPANDING THE MONEY AVAILABLE AND BUILDING THOSE OUT MORE QUICKLY. IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE CAN DO TO AVOID THE KIND OF A SITUATION THAT AND HER FAMILY FOUND THEMSELVES IN -- WE ALSO WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE LIMIT ON THE USE OF SECLUSION RESTRAINT IN CHILDREN'S CRISIS HOMES AS A WAY OF NOT THERE ARE CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THAT MAY NEED TO BE DONE BUT THERE ARE PROTOCOLS THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS DEVELOPED FOR A TOLD HOMES THAT SHOULD BE REPLICATED -- IN THE CHILDREN'S CRISIS HOMES -- THE DEPARTMENT APPROPRIATELY HAS IDENTIFIED OF THE NEED FOR REDUCE CASELOADS WE SUPPORT THAT WE WILL NOTE THAT THERE IS A TIME LIMIT ABOUT HOW LONG THOSE CAN BE AVAILABLE. AND WE THINK THE STANDARD FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE TRANSITIONING FROM OF A LIVING ARRANGEMENT BACK TO LOOK AT A LOWER LEVEL OF COMMUNITY SERVICE. SHOULD BE THE SAME AS FOR PEOPLE MOVING OUT OF DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS WHICH IS FOR A YEAR OR SO BOTH KNEW THAT IN THE FACILITY. WHAT WERE YOU LOOKING FOR PLACEMENT BUT EQUALLY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE LEAVING AND YOU MIGHT BE MOST AT RISK OF A RE OCCURRENCE? I'M GONNA QUICKLY TALK ABOUT -- THREE THINGS THAT THE R. C. IS INTERESTED IN. BUT FIRST IS -- AS OF A DIRECTOR -- HEATHER NOTED ON THAT -- FLOORS NOTED IS THAT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO ALLOW REGIONAL CENTER PILOTS THAT WILL LOOK AT NEW WAYS OF PROVIDING SERVICES -- FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BOTH DEVELOPMENTAL AND MENTAL HEALTH DISABILITIES SOMETIMES IT MAKES SENSE TO LOOK AT WHAT LOCAL FOLKS KNOW THE NEEDS ARE HOW THEY CAN COORDINATE WITH MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES HOW THEY CAN DEVELOP. UP CAPACITY THE SECOND IS TO RE ALIGN HOW WE COMMIT PEOPLE TO I AM DIS. ARM TO HAVE THAT STANDARD BE THE SAME AS PEOPLE GOING INTO THE SHORT TERM ACUTE CRISIS AND YOU CAN READ -- THE DETAILS OF THAT AND THE THIRD IS TO ENSURE THAT THE CLIENTS RIGHTS ADVOCATES WHO CAN DIRECTLY INTERVENE IN THE MIDST OF A CRISIS GET NOTICE WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE IN -- SITE FACILITIES OR WHEN THEIR COMMITTED IN THE SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED PROCEEDING. THANK YOU -- I JUST MAKE NOTE WE HAVE. A VERY LONG AGENDA THIS IS ONLY PART A WE STILL HAVE PART B. TO GO IT'S READY FOR PM THERE'S ITSELF I'D FULLY MY STAFF DOES EDUCATE PEOPLE ABOUT TIME LIMITS NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR STORIES BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE FAIR TO THE PEOPLE. WHO WILL BE HEARD PROBABLY SEVEN OR EIGHT PM TONIGHT AND DEL DAY? SO I SO YOU KNOW AND WE DO ASK PEOPLE OF SOME THAT THINGS IN WRITING IF THEY WANT TO GIVE SOMETHING MORE EXTENDED SO APPRECIATE -- SO I GUESS -- DIRECTOR AREA. THIS IS IT IS A PEDIATRICIAN YOU KNOW I'VE. ACTUALLY WORKED WITH FAMILIES WHO'VE HAD CHILDREN TOO YOU KNOW -- PHRASEOLOGY HIT ADOLESCENCE -- THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES DEVELOPMENTAL ISSUES I SPECIALIZE IN CHILDREN WITH DEVELOPMENTAL ISSUES. TWELVE SO I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING VERY HARD TWELVE SPOTS IS IN A POPULATION WHAT'S THE THREE POINT NINE WERE ALMOST FORTY MILLION WE HAVEN'T QUITE HIT IT DO F. JUST CAME OUT THEIR NUMBERS I THINK WAS YESTERDAY OR DAY BEFORE -- SO WHAT WHAT SO HOW WE FIGURE OUT OUR RIGHT SIZING LIE HOW MANY IT AND SO FORTH SO THAT THIS. HAPPENED. SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT SPURS LIKE OKAY NINE THREE SHE YOU KNOW YOUR TITLES OUT WE ARE. CLOSING THE ABOUT THE CENTERS BUT HOPEFUL -- WHAT WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY? BEDS WE NERI BEDS OR BEYONCE'S -- OR SPACES WE NEED. AND TWELVE CELLS LIKE A VERY SMALL NUMBER -- AND I REALIZE AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME PEOPLE PEOPLE NEED SOME OF THE MOST INTENSE OF SERVICES AND I THINK WHAT I WAS ONE OF THE CONCERNS WE SAID NGUYEN CLOSE DOWN THE VOLATILES CENTERS RIGHT SO WE'RE GOING TO DO. WE NEED TO ACTUALLY INVEST IN THESE. THINGS SO I KNOW THAT YOU FIFTY L. THE SAFETY NET FACILITIES SO FORTH SO WHAT WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE PLAN TO LIKE HOW MANY RECLAIM THE WHAT'S THE PLAN IF YOU'RE HOW WE WE NEED AND HOW WE GET THERE TERMS OF THE HAVING THIS FACILITIES AVAILABLE. THANK YOU DOCTOR CAN M.. AS YOU CAN TELL THIS IS SUCH A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE RIGHT NOW WE ARE SEEING AN INCREASED NUMBER OF KIDS PARTICULARLY THAT HAVE CO OCCURRING NEEDS VERY COMPLEX -- AND DO REALLY TAKING A LOOK AT IT SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE NOTE pWHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT OUR SAFETY NET PLAN -- WE'RE GOING TO BE PRESENTING A AYE AND OUTLINING KIND OF ACROSS THE STATE HAD A WHAT ARE THOSE SERVICES SO. YOU KNOW BEFORE YOU TODAY IS THE THREE COMMUNITY CRISIS HOMES FOR CHILDREN IT'S A NEW MODEL IT IS GOING TO BE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- WE HAVE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BE ABLE TO HAVE THE ESTABLISHMENT AS A NEW LICENSE CATEGORY. SO IT'S ONLY FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY -- IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE'S NOT OTHER SERVICES THAT'S BEING DEVELOPED WITHIN THE REGIONAL CENTERS SO YOU HAVE OTHER HOMES THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED THAT ARE CRISIS HOMES. THE DESIGN OF THE COMMUNITY CRISIS HOME FOR CHILDREN IS REALLY KIND OF A VERY HIGH INTENSITY. AND AND REALLY WITH THE EXPERIENCES THAT KYLE'S FACING AND SO MANY OTHERS THAT ARE THE CHALLENGES THAT. AND IT WAS BECAUSE THROUGH THOSE CHALLENGES THAT WE SAID WE NEED TO DEVELOP A NOTHER MODEL OF SERVICE YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE SUPPORTS. AND SO THAT IS REALLY THE INTENT OF THOSE THREE IS FOR THOSE REALLY KINDA UNIQUE CHALLENGES THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS. THE OTHER PIECE OF IT IS THAT WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT MAKING SURE THAT COMMUNITY PLACEMENT PLAN THE PRIORITY. FOR NINETEEN TWENTY IS THAT ALL OF WHILE WE WILL STILL DO SOME THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. THE PRIORITY IN THE GUIDELINES AS ABOUT THE SAFETY NET. SO MAKING SURE THAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE DEVELOPING FIRST WORLD IN APPROVED FIRST ALL OF THE SERVICES THAT NEED TO BE WITHIN THE REGIONAL CENTERS IT'S NOT GOING TO MEET ALL THE NEEDS. BUT THEY ALL NEED TO TAKE AN INVENTORY OF WHAT THE NEEDS ARE WITHIN THEIR AREA AND WE'RE GOING TO PRIORITIZE THAT DEVELOPMENT. SO I JUST WANT TO YOU KNOW IT'S A LONG DISCUSSION THAT WE CAN CERTAINLY HAVE IS TO THOSE STRATEGIES -- BUT THE OTHER PIECES THAT WE'RE GONNA BE PILOTING MORE WORKING WITH TO REGIONAL CENTERS THAT ARE GOING TO BE PILOTING KIND OF A NEW MODEL THAT IS MORE OF A INFORMED. CREDIT -- TRAUMA FOCUSED -- SUPPORT SYSTEM SO BECAUSE OF THAT THAT STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS THAT WE HAD WITH WITH FAMILY MEMBERS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING THIS MOST COMPLEX SITUATIONS THAT ARE VERY DEVASTATING TO THEM. IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE SOME OF THOSE STEPS SO OUR FIRST STEP IS PILOTING A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST. THAT IS WITHIN OUR CURRENT PRIORITIZE SEEN OUR COMMUNITY PLACEMENT PLAN FUNDS FOR THESE PURPOSES DEVELOPING TO STATE OPERATED -- COMMUNITY KIRK TO STATE OPERATED CRISIS SERVICES OUR STAR HOMES BETTER FOCUS JUST FOR CHILDREN AND THEN STARTING WITH THOSE THREE HOMES BY WAY OF HAVING A NEW LICENSE CATEGORY WE CAN EXPAND BEYOND THOSE THREE HOMES AS JUST TO START. SO IT'S YES -- AND IT I THINK. YOU MADE SOME COMMENT ABOUT THIS -- TO IS IS THAT -- I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO SAY OKAY WHAT IS THIS NEW MODEL GOING TO BE RIGHT BECAUSE WE HAVE LOTS OF DIFFERENT PIECES YOU HAVE YOUR STAR HOMES RIGHT WHICH IS BEING OPERATED BY THE STATE. THERE ARE ABLE TO SELL RIGHT AND THEN YOU HAVE YOUR REGIONAL CENTERS. TO WHILE ALSO TAKING OUT THAT AND THAT AND THIS AND THE SOURCE SPECTRUM THAT THEY'LL TAKE IN EXACTLY WHAT YOU KNOW UP TO WHAT POINT AND MAYBE VARIES A LITTLE BIT BY REGIONAL CENTER. EXACTLY HOW WHAT POINT SEVERITY CAN THEY HANDLE RIGHT IN TERMS OF AND WHAT CUT FACILITIES WILL THEY BE OPERATING BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S NOT JUST THE STAR HOME SO WITH SO WHERE'S THAT INTERFACES IS GOING TO BE IN TERMS OF BETWEEN. AND I DON'T KNOW IS IS IS THIS IS THE FUTURE. FOR YOU PLAIN. TO FILLED OUT MORE OR STAR HOMES IN THE LONG TERM OR IS IT GOING TO BE MORE WELL ACTUALLY HESE ARE MODELS THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA TRANSITION TO REGIONAL CENTERS REGIONAL CENTERS ON THE BE OPERATING HOW MANY CRISIS SOME SO. I MEAN. AND YOU MAY BE STILL FIGURING SOME OF THAT OUT US IN EXACTLY AND HOW MANY HOW MANY OF THEM WE GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE CURRENT ACUITY AND WHERE WE THINK THAT'S GOING. HOW MANY? FACILITIES DO WE NEED AN OPERATE BY WHOM SO AND THAT IS SO LEAD TO HELPFUL TO HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF THAT -- YEAH OF THE THE IT DID IT WOULD BE ON THE NEXT YEAR OR SO WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT OUR SOMETIME IN THE COMING YEAR LIKE WHAT WHAT IS THE SORT OF THE OVERALL PLAN I. V. ON THIS IS THE THIS IS THE INITIAL SAFETY NET SELLING CRISIS SERVICES. BUT WHERE WE ARE WHERE WE WERE WE GOING TO THE YOU KNOW WE WERE. HOPEFULLY WE'RE GONNA BE FUNNY YOU SOME MORE STAFF TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE STUFF BUT I MEAN JUST. WHAT WHAT? WHERE WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE PLAN THAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD HOW ME AND AT LEAST A BASELINE OF DATA ABOUT HOW MANY? HOW MANY BEDS WHAT'S THERE HOW MANY? THINGS OF HOW WHAT SEVERITY DO WE NEED RIGHT S. NOW THAT WE'VE CLOSED OUT INCLUDING DOT DEVELOPMENTAL -- CENTERS OF WHAT WHAT WHAT WE HAVE OUT THERE AND WHAT WE NEED TO BUILD OUT TO AND HE'S GOING TO DO IT RIGHT HOW'S IT GOING TO BE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER IS GOING TO GO UP THAT CERTAIN POINT. STATES CAN DO CERTAIN POINT CETERA I THINK SOME CLARITY THERE WOULD BE HELPFUL. YEAH AND AND REALLY MUCH OF THE THE INVENTORY THAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING THROUGH THE CPP PLANS -- IN THIS CYCLE IS GOING TO GIVE US SIGNIFICANT CLARITY AS TO WHERE WE ARE AND WE DO HAVE IN INVENTORY CURRENTLY. BUT REALLY KIND OF EXPANDING THAT WITH EACH OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND UNDERSTANDING THAT BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE REALLY DO HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT MULTIPLE APPROACHES. I MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE FROM PREVENTATIVE SUPPORT SERVICES TO MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE THE EFFORT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT SUPPORT. TO REALLY REDUCE THE RISK OF HAVING SOME A CHILD HAVING TO GO OUT OF HOME INTO A CRISIS SERVICE BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT WE WERE SEEN. IN THE INCREASE OF OF REQUEST -- FOR MORE STATE OPERATED SUPPORT SERVICES IS REALLY WHAT GAVE US THE INDICATION THAT WE IMMEDIATELY NEEDED TO TAKE A LOOK AT WITHIN OUR PROPOSAL IN ABILITY AND THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE SEEING THE THREE HOMES ASKING FOR THE COMMUNICATIONS HOME LICENSE. SO WE CAN HELP THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY THESE OPTIONS AND HAVE THOSE RESOURCES AVAILABLE -- BUT A GREAT IN TAKING A LOOK AT KIND OF A MAPPING OF THE STATE AND HAD A WHERE WE ARE AND WHAT THE FUTURE NEEDS ARE ALSO SERVE THEM. SO WHAT'S THE DEMAND ALRIGHT SO THERE'S AND THEN THERE'S INVENTORIES LIKE WHAT ARE CAPACITY IS WHAT'S THE DEMAND AND THEN THE SERVER ROADMAP OF US WERE BIG REALLY GOING INTO THIS NEW WORLD RIGHT WITH THE CLOSING DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS BUILDING. THEY'LL THIS PROPOSAL THE SICKNESSES ELISE -- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS IN A ROLE HOW THE INTERFACE RATE -- ARE NOT DEPENDING ON THE LOCATIONS AND SO FORTH -- ANY OF THE MOBILE CRISIS TEMA HOW'S THAT FIT INTO THIS PICTURE SO. IN THE END AND I THINK PEOPLE ALSO NEED SOME CLARITY SO THAT THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE'RE GONNA HAVE GAPS RIGHT I MEAN -- SO OF SOMEONE'S GOT LIKE WHAT'S NOT MINE IS NOT MINE AND THEN FOR FAMILY STOCK RIGHT AND SO [inaudible] OKAY. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER COMMENTS THEN. OKAY WELL THANKS VERY MUCH FO YOUR PRESENTATIONS APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. ELSE ON THAT. ONE BECAUSE THIS YOU NUMBER EIGHT THE OVERVIEW AND THAT CHANGED RULES OF FOR EIGHT CBS COMPLIANCE AND FINAL RULE SITE ASSESSMENTS [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] CAN. IT'S HELPFUL TO HAVE. IT'S HARD TO HEAR THE THE OF A PARTICULAR RELIGIOUS COMMENTING OR IS IT A PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS. SHIFTED AROUND YEAH [inaudible] OKAY. ARE IN SO WILL SO THREE EFFORT. THE PANEL FOR COMMENTING AFTERWARDS SO WHAT'S GOING HAD BEGIN WITH THE PROPOSAL OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. YEAH. I DOCTOR PENA JIM NIGHT WITH DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SUGGEST -- THE AGENDA DOES A GOOD JOB AGAIN SOME BACKGROUND ABOUT WHAT THESE -- HOME A COMMUNITY SERVICES RULES ARE ABOUT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND WHAT THE PROPOSAL IS IS FOR US TO BUILD ON AND HELP US DETERMINE WHERE WE ARE AS FAR AS MEETING THOSE REQUIREMENTS. AND SO THE THE REQUEST IS -- FOR THREE MILLION DOLLARS ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION IN GENERAL FUND FOR US TO DO -- AN ON SITE ASSESSMENT WHICH IS REQUIRED AS PART OF THE SELF -- STATEWIDE TRANSITION PLAN. AND THE THESE ON SITE ASSESSMENTS -- BECAUSE WE NEED TO DO ABOUT ALL ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED OF THEM WE REALLY NEED SOME SUPPORT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND EFFICIENT TIME FRAME. THESE ASSESSMENTS ARE GOING TO SERVE AS A VALIDATION OF WHAT IS BEEN REFERRED TO AS A SELF ASSESSMENT WHICH ALL PROVIDERS WILL -- YOU NEED TO COMPLETE -- AS PART OF THIS PROCESS AS WELL TO US TO IDENTIFY AGAIN WE ARE WE ARE IN MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS AND WHAT NEEDS TO WHAT ACTIONS NEED TO BE TAKEN IN ORDER TO GET THERE. SO THIS PROPOSAL REALLY BUILDS UPON SOME OF THE PRIOR EFFORTS AND SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN TOUCHED ON IN THE AGENDA AS WELL. IT'S REALLY IF YOU THINK ABOUT A KIND OF A STEPPING STONE OF US GETTING GETTING TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE. AND SO SOME OF THE EFFORTS -- THAT ARE MENTIONED WERE IN THE BUDGET -- IN PREVIOUS BUDGET HAS BEEN FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN EACH OF THE PRIOR THREE YEARS -- FOR PROPOSED A SERVICE PROVIDERS OR TO REQUEST SOME FUNDS IN ORDER TO MAKE SOME MODIFICATIONS ARE TO MEET THE THE REQUIREMENTS. AS THE AGENDA NOTES THAT -- SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED INCLUDED PERSON CENTERED PLANNING TRAINING AND TRAIN THE TRAINER -- ASSISTANCE -- WITH STAFF TO HAVE FOLKS BE ABLE TO SEE CAN AND OBTAIN COMPETITIVE EMPLOYMENT. AND SOME OTHER AREAS AS WELL. SO PART OF THAT PROCESS AGAIN TALKING ABOUT BUILDING ON WHERE WE'VE BEEN GOING IT WAS REALLY DESIGNED THAT PROCESS WITH SOME STAKEHOLDER INPUT WHICH WAS VERY VALUABLE. TO HELP. NOT ONLY -- OBVIOUSLY. HOW THE MONEY WOULD BE GIVEN OUT THE TO HELP PROVIDE SOME EDUCATION AND FOR US TO ASSESS WHERE WE ARE AS WELL? SO THE UPSET THE THAT -- APPROVAL PROCESS OR THE CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS FOR THE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS REQUIRES IT PROVIDERS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PEOPLE THY SERVE. REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE THEY ARE IN MEETING THESE REQUIREMENTS INTO THAT PROVIDES A VALUABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR KNOWLEDGE PROVIDERS BUT FOLKS RECEIVING SERVICES TO HELP LEARN. HOW THESE -- NEW FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO THEIR SITUATIONS -- ANOTHER THING THAT'S BEEN. BUILDING UPON AS SAYS ALSO REFERENCE TO SEE -- REGIONAL CENTER STAFF POSITIONS ARE EVALUATORS AT EACH REGIONAL CENTER -- SOME OF THE THE ACTIVITIES A BEEN INVOLVED IN HIS BAND OVERSIGHT OF THE OBVIOUSLY THE FUNDING PROCESS ALSO HOLDING FROM LOCAL FORMS IN THEIR AREA. TO HELP INFORM NOT ONLY PROVIDERS BUT ALSO PEOPLE RECEIVE SERVICES AND DOING SOME BRAINSTORMING WITHIN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY ABOUT WHAT ARE SOME OTHER THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE. OR WHEN BUT THESE RULES REALLY MEAN. ADDITIONALLY THE APARTMENTS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH A CONTRACTOR TO ASSIST IN OUTREACH AND TRAINING ACTIVITIES THE TO REFOCUS ON WHAT THESE RULES MAIMED AND TO PREPARE FOR THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS. IN THAT TRAINING AND IN THE OUT REACH IS NOT ONLY GOING TO BE FOR PROVIDERS BUT IT'S BEEN MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S GOING -- TO FOCUSED ON FOLKS WHO RECEIVE SERVICES THEIR FAMILIES AND OTHERS. IT IS PART OF THAT OF THAT A SELF ASSESSMENT PROCESS IN AND ON SITE ASSESSMENT PROCESS OF THE SELF ASSESSMENT PROCESS WERE LOOKING TO START LATER THIS SUMMER. AND THEN THE ON SITE ASSESSMENT PENDING APPROVAL OF THIS PROPOSAL WOULD START EARLY NEXT YEAR. THAT'S GOING TO INFORM US WHERE WE ARE TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION DAY YOU HAD IN THE AGENDA OF HOW MANY -- FACILITIES ARE IN COMPLIANCE. AND SO ALSO AGAIN TALKING ABOUT BUILDING ON TO WHAT WE'RE DOING -- IN YOU KNOW RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF IMPORTANCE OF PERSON CENTERED PLANNING AND PERSON CENTER PRACTICES IN. AS IT RELATES CITIES RULES THE PARCHMENT SOON GOING TO BE ENTERING INTO A CONTRACT WITH A ANOTHER -- ENTITY IN ORDER TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TRAINING AND INFORMATION IN THAT AREA AS WELL BECAUSE THAT'S JUST SUCH A CRITICAL ROLE -- PERSON CENTERED -- THINKING AND PRACTICES ARE SUCH A CRITICAL -- PIECE OF MEETING THESE REQUIREMENTS SO WE REALIZED THAT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE HAD TO DO AS WELL. SO IT IN ADDITION TO EVERYTHING THAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL ON ALL THOSE STEPS ARE STILL MORE TO DO -- ONE OF THE THE OTHER QUESTIONS YOU HAD IN YOUR AGENDA AS ABOUT THE HEIGHTENED REVIEW PROCESS OR IS -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CALLS IT HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY -- WHICH JUST THE WORDING OF THAT OBVIOUSLY CREATES -- A LOT OF CONCERN RIGHT BECAUSE BEFORE THAT WHAT REALLY GOES UNDER QUOTE HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY. IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOOD -- WHAT -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RELATED -- LABEL AS A PLACE IT IS PRESUMED INSTITUTIONAL. SO WHAT IT BUT IT REALLY THAN MEANS FOR FOLKS WHEN YOU READ THAT IS THAT. YOU'RE PRESUMED GUILTY AND LESS AFTER WE REALLY REALLY LOOK CLOSE YOU CAN PROVE THAT YOU'RE NOT -- SO THAT OBVIOUSLY CREATES A LOT OF CONCERN FOR US AND SO IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE REALLY BEEN TRYING TO TAKE A MAJOR LOOK AT IN DEVELOPING WHAT THAT PROCESS IS. BECAUSE TO WE HAD TO WHAT WHAT FALLS UNDER THAT -- PROCESS ARE PLACES THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS SAID -- TEND TO ISOLATE. AND SO INITIAL GUIDANCE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS -- ACTUALLY. HAD A LITTLE BIT EVEN CREATED MORE CONFUSION AND WHEN READ LITERALLY ONE COULD EVEN THINK THAT -- PLACES THAT WERE WORLD THAT WE'RE NOT LOCATED NEAR -- PUBLIC AND OR WERE NOT LOCATED NEAR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. FIT INTO THIS -- THIS THIS REVIEW PROCESS WHICH OF COURSE CREATED EVEN MORE CONFUSION KNOWING THAT -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD FOR A LONG TIME -- INDICATED THAT FURTHER GUIDANCE WOULD BE COMING OUT WE REALLY WERE WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WE HAD THE MOST RECENT INFORMATION BEFORE GOING FORWARD. SO THAT GUIDANCE DID JUST COME OUT IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR WE SENT IT OUT TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS. AND WE WANT -- TO OBVIOUSLY BE INFORMED BY OR ADVISORY GROUP AND OTHERS AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN DEVELOPING THAT PROCESS. AND SO THAT'S INITIALLY WERE GOING TO BE HAVING A MEETING WITH OUR EIGHT CBS ADVISOR GROUP LATER THIS MONTH AND THAT'S GOING TO BE PART OF THE TOPICS. THANK YOU A THOMAS MILIEU. THANK YOU -- REGARDING THE PROPOSAL -- FOR FOR CONDUCTING THE ON SITE ASSESSMENTS -- WE AGREE WITH THE DEPARTMENT THAT THIS -- IS SOMETHING THAT IT IS GOING TO NEED TO HAPPEN SOON -- IT'S PART OF THE STATE WIDE TRANSITION PLAN THAT'S BEEN -- INITIALLY APPROVED BY THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES -- AND THEY DID BASE THEIR COSTS ON AND WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES ESTIMATES COSTS WILL BE TO CONDUCT THOSE ASSESSMENTS SO. WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THAT PROPOSAL -- REGARDING AS THE EACH CBS RULES MORE GENERALLY -- IF I MAY I'D LIKE TO SORT OF T. HAVE BEEN ISSUE THAT WILL PROBABLY BE DISCUSSED NEXT WEEK IN OUR RATE STUDY DISCUSSION AND THAT IS. THAT IN GENERAL THERE MAY NEED TO BE MORE TRANSPARENCY FROM THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT WHICH SERVICE CATEGORIES IT DOES NOT CONSIDER COMPLIANCE WITH THE EACH CBS RULES. A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE WORK ACTIVITY PROGRAMS THERE'S I THINK -- SOME. ANXIETY IT -- IN THE COMMUNITY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS SERVICE -- HAS TO GO OR WHETHER THERE'S A WAY TO WORK IT OUT BIRD DOESN'T HAVE TO GO -- IT'S SORT OF UNCLEAR AND SO I THINK IT'LL BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE SOME GUIDANCE ON HOW THOSE TAPES BUT IF THOSE SERVICES ARE NOT GOING TO BE SUPPORTED IN THE FUTURE. HOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE PHASED OUT AND WHAT ALTERNATIVE? SERVICES GOOD QUALITY ALTERNATIVE SERVICES WILL BE PROVIDED TO CONSUMERS DURING THE PHASE OUT AND AFTERWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU FINANCE ONCE. ALL RIGHT AND WE HAVE -- TO SINGLE PAYER WHAT THE COMMENT ON ON THIS -- SO WE HAVE MARTY AMADO ACOSTA AND IS A DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SENIOR ME ACTION NETWORK AND JAMIE DAVIS EXACT DOCTOR MARIN VENTURE SO THEY WILL START WITH. AND THAT ORDERED AND OKAY AND WILL BE BRIEFED WE KNOW THE TIME IS THEM WE APPRECIATE -- YOU KNOW YOU THE THE HEARING AND ALL THE ISSUES THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE OF HEARD. OF FIRST -- DDS HAS TAKEN SOME GOOD STEPS ON OF MOVING TOWARDS A COMPLIANCE OF EIGHT CBS AND I'VE BEEN ON THE EIGHT CBS ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR THE PAST OR GROUP FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS. BUT WE DO THINK THAT THERE NEED TO BE MUCH MORE GUIDANCE COMING FROM THE DEPARTMENT AND FROM THE STATE -- IN PERHAPS THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDING MORE GUIDANCE ON WHAT COMPLIANCE MEANS. AND ONE THING WE WOULD ST SUGGEST SAYS AFTER BI BI MONTHLY MONTH -- BY MONTHLY CONFERENCE CALLS -- WEBINARS WITH THE EIGHT CBS TRANSITION FUNDING GRANTEES -- ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE TALKED TO SOME OF THE GRANTEES IS THAT THERE'S CONFUSION ABOUT YOU KNOW WHETHER WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN THEIR PROJECT IS -- IN COMPLIANCE OR THEY'RE RUNNING INTO DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WHAT'S THE THE REGIONAL CENTER -- PERSON AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THE REGIONAL CENTER PERSONS A BAD PERSON IS JUST MEANS OUT. THE CONFERENCE CALLED WOULD PROMOTE MORE OF A PARTNERSHIP BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY AN EXCITING THING IF WE WORK AT RIGHT. TO TRANSFORMING OUR SYSTEM ALSO THAT THE D. G. DDS. ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON THE CBS NEED TO MEET MORE FREQUENTLY PERHAPS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS WE DON'T MEET. AT ALL SOMETIMES -- YOU KNOW FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME SO WHAT IT THE LACK OF INFORMATION PROMOTE SO. A LOT OF FEAR AND ANXIETY -- AND ALSO -- I'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE GRANTEES. SOMETIMES -- SOME OF THE GRANTS ARE TREATED MORE AS A PROGRAM AND NOT AS A GRANT AND THEREFORE IT IT MAKES IT MUCH MORE HARDER. TO IMPLEMENT THE GRANT -- SECOND DATE CBS FINAL RULE INCLUDES PROVISIONS REQUIRING PERSON CENTERED PLANNING IN THAT PROCESS WHICH JIM SPOKE OF IN AT THIS DONE THE RIGHT WAY CAN HAVE BE A SIGNIFICANT TOOL IN PROCESS TO ALIGNING. WHAT A PERSON WANTS AND NEEDS? TO WHAT SERVICES SUPPORTS CAN BE PROVIDED MEASURED BY OUTCOMES AND MOST PEOPLE DON'T WHAT IT IS AND SO WE WOULD SUGGEST. THAT THE DEPARTMENT IN KERR -- ACTUALLY REQUIRES THAT WERE UP ALLOW -- PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES -- TO RECEIVE THE ORIENTATION AND TRAINING AND PERSON CENTERED PLANNING -- THIRD. SOME SETTINGS AS A THE HE'LL ELLIE -- JUST MENTION MAY OR MAY NOT BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE H. E. B. AS FINAL RULE. IT IS NOT FAIR TO THE WORKERS OF THE PEOPLE IN THOSE TYPES OF SETTINGS. TO BE CONTINUED TO CONTINUE YEAR AFTER YEAR NOT KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE SETTING WOULD EVER BE IN COMPLIANCE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO THE LEGISLATURE IN THE STATE ADMINISTRATION NEEDS. TO KIND OF MOVE FORWARD ON SOME POLICY ISSUES AND TERM AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE CERTAIN SETTING IS ACTUALLY NO LONGER. WHAT WE NEED TO BE AND THAT WE SHOULD TRANSITION THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND THOSE WORKERS INTO A? A A DIFFERENT TYPE OF SETTING THAT IS THAT IS COMPLIANT AND USE THE SAME TYPE OF PROCESS AND SENSITIVITY THAT WE USE WHEN WE CLOSE THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS MEANING WE TREATED THE STAFF AS WELL AS THE PEOPLE RECEIVING SERVICES WITH RESPECT. AND TO TRY TO MAINTAIN THEIR LEVEL OF EXPERTISE AND MOVING THEM INTO A COMMUNITY LASTLY. FUNDING IS A MAJOR BARRIER FOR PROVIDERS AND THE PEOPLE THEY SERVE IN TRANSITIONING TO COMPLIANCE AT THAT WE SUGGEST THAT YOU WOULD TARGET. OR THE STATE TARGET SO FUNDING INCREASES TO THOSE PEOPLE TO THOSE PROVIDERS WHO ARE COMPLIANT OR IN PROCESS OF TRANSITION TOWARD COMPLIANCE THANKS. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR THANK AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. MY NAME IS JAMIE DAVIS AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR MARIN VENTURES A SITE BASED COMMUNITY INTEGRATION TRAINING PROGRAM IN CENTER FILE. AND I'VE SUBMITTED A MORE COMPLETE VERSION OF MY REMARKS -- TO THE COMMITTEE. I'D LIKE TO OFFER A WAY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT AN INSTITUTION IS AND WHAT CAN BE ISOLATING FOR THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. THE MORE THE ACTIVITIES FOCUS ON THE NEEDS OF THE STAFF THE MORE LIKELY IT IS IT'S AN INSTITUTION. WHEN WE BECOME CENTERED ON THE PERSON WERE SERVING? WE MOVE TOWARD LESS INSTITUTIONAL OPERATIONS. I ALSO BELIEVE WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT PHILOSOPHIES AND POLICIES WE PROMOTE. MOST OF THE PEOPLE WE SUPPORT HAVE THE SMALLEST ARE NO POLITICAL VOICE. AND ARE AMONG THE MOST MARGINALIZED AND IMPOVERISHED. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THE POWER THAT WE HAVE AS WE ADVOCATE FOR THEM. MY REMARKS TODAY FOCUS ON WHETHER PROVIDERS FEEL PREPARED FOR MARCH. TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHEN WILL BE EXPECTED BE FULLY COMPLIANT WITH H. CBS SETTINGS REGULATIONS. ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO A SETTINGS WHICH MAY BE ISOLATING -- ACCORDING TO AGE CBS. I THINK THEY'RE BIG UNANSWERED QUESTIONS THAT I HEAR FROM PROVIDERS WHEN WE HAVE THE SELF ASSESSMENTS OF OUR PROGRAM SO WE CAN FIND OUT IF WE APPEAR TO BE COMPLIANT TO THE REGULATIONS. ACCORDING TO OURSELVES. WHEN WE KNOW IF WE'VE INTERPRETED THE SELF ASSESSMENT CORRECTLY ACCORDING TO THE STATE? WHEN WE KNOW WHAT PROGRAMS A STATE WILL SELECT FOR FURTHER REVIEW? WHEN ALL STATE TELL US IF THEY ARE DEFINING CHARACTERISTICS OF ISOLATING BEYOND THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES AND WHAT ARE THOSE? WHEN WE KNOW FOR PROGRAM IS CONSIDERED TO BE ISOLATING AND THEREFORE NOT COMPLIANT? WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT OF FELT MIDDLE SERVICES DURING TO PARTNER WITH KEY AGENCIES LIKE COMMITTEE CARE LICENSING SO THE COMPLIANCE WITH H. CBS DOES NOT PUT US OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH COMMUNICATOR LICENSING? HOW WILL THE STATE HELP PROVIDERS WORK WITH AN EMPLOYMENT LAW TO BECOME MORE PERSON CENTERED? WHEN SOME EMPLOYMENT LAWS LIKE BREAK AND REST PERIODS ARE IN CONFLICT WITH BEING LESS INSTITUTIONAL? HOW CAN WE INNOVATE AND DEVELOP BETTER PRACTICES TO HELP US BECOME H. CBS COMPLIANT? WE TEETER ON THE EDGE OF FINANCIAL INSTABILITY. I'M HAPPY TO BE A RESOURCE FOR THE COMMITTEE AND INVITE YOU TO VISIT MARIN VENTURES OR ANY PROGRAM WHICH MAY BE. PERCEIVED BE ISOLATING UNDER AGE TO BE US. FINALLY AS I DO IT EVERY OPPORTUNITY I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT UNTIL WE CAN PAY OUR DIRECT SUPPORT EMPLOYEES A BETTER THAN. POVERTY LEVEL WAGES OUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY MEET THE H. CBS GUIDELINES IS TERRIBLY TERRIBLY COMPROMISED. AND BILLIONS OF FEDERAL DOLLARS ARE AT STAKE THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] SO. WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT -- PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY NEED TO DO [inaudible] SO HOW. AND THEY HAD AND YOU HAVE UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY TWO MARCH -- YOU CAN'T TELL PEOPLE THE LAST MINUTE AND HAVE THEM SUDDENLY CHANGES WHAT THEY'RE DOING THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING THE RIGHT THINGTHEY'RE NOT WHAT THEY'RE EXPECTED TO DO WHAT THEY'RE IN. FACT SO -- TELL ME HERE SO. WHAT WHAT WE CAN DO TO DREAD SUITED TO ADDRESS THAT A CELL? THANK YOU YOU KNOW AND THESE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT COMMENTS AND AND ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF OUR EIGHT CBS WORKGROUP IS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE -- THE DIALOGUE TO TO SAY OKAY WHERE THE THE THE THINGS THAT ARE CONCERNING TO THE COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO MOVE TOWARDS THE COMPLIANCE WE STILL HAVE THE FIFTEEN MILLION EVERY YEAR -- THAT THIS IS OUR THIRD YEAR OF PUTTING FORWARD AS MISTER KNIGHT HEAD HAD SHARED. SO THOSE ARE THAT'S ONE OF THE EFFORTS THAT WERE WERE DOING. I DO AGREE THAT THE COMMUNICATION NEEDS TO IMPROVE AS FAR AS BEING ABLE TO HAVE THAT COMMUNICATION TO THE COMMUNITY AND REALLY THE EFFORT BY HAVING THE ARE IF HE AND THE CONTRACTORS THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO USE. IS GOING TO GIVE US THE INFORMATION AS TO THOSE STEPS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING FOR THE SELF EVALUATIONS AND THEN TE SITE ASSESSMENTS. SO HAVING THAT. ASSISTANCE WITH THE CONSULTANTS IS GOING TO GIVE CLARITY TO WHAT WE CAN COMMUNICATE. SO VERY YOU KNOW HAVING THESE ELEMENTS IS GOING TO BE THE INFORMATION TO DO THAT -- THE COMMITMENT OF WORKING WITH THE AGE TO BE S. WORK GROUP IS -- GOING TO BE STEPPED UP AND THAT'S EVIDENCED BY HAVING TO THE MEETING THAT SCHEDULED NOW AND WE'RE GOING TO BE SEEN OF THAT MUCH MORE FREQUENT TIME -- MORE WE'RE GONNA BE SPENDING TOGETHER WITH OUR COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING THE INFORMATION AND TAKING THOSE STEPS THE OTHER THING IS IS THAT -- FIRST OF ALL YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT SOUNDS LIKE YOU TRY TO FIGURE OUT SOME OF THE ANSWERS RIGHT TO AND AND ACTUALLY I I WOULD POINT OUT SO THE EIGHT CBS. RULES ARE SET BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO WRITE SO I APPRECIATE REFERENCING THE LEGISLATURE BUT ACTUALLY COMPLIANCE IS THAT SOMETHING WE HAVE MUCH OF A SAY AND IT'S THE FED'S WORKING WITH THE AGENCY AND THEN SAY THAT THIS IS SO. AND BELIEVE ME I DEAL WITH THIS ON THE MEDI CAL SIDE OTHER PLACES TO WRITE SO -- TO BE SURE EVERYONE'S ON THE SAME PAGE -- ELSA HOPE THAT IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATION THAT. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY EVERYONE HAS REIMPORTANT ROLES TO PLAY BUT THAT WE'RE NOT IT'S NOT THAT THINGS ARE LIKE TELEPHONE WHAT HAPPENS SO I TELL YOU AND THEN THAT PERSON SPACE TELL THEM THAT PERSONS POSTS TO TELL THEM BECAUSE IT'S POSSIBLE THERE'S THINGS GET LOST IN TRANSLATION. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS THERE'S PEOPLE EVERY LAYER SHOULD HAVE BE ABLE TO HEAR THAT HAVE DIRECT CONTACT WITH. THE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE YOU'RE THE FINAL ARBITER BE OUT YOUR THE INTERPRETER TO FINAL ARBITRATION FROM THE SAID SO I MEAN. AND SO EL AT THE THE CONTRACTOR WITH TWO DEALS WITH THAT REGIONAL CENTER. NOW DOESN'T NEED NEED TO BE ABLE TO SAY WELL ACTUALLY THAT EVERYONE EASIER SAME THING SO THEY KNOW WHAT THE RULES ARE IT'S NOT THAT -- WELL. I HEARD THE DEPARTMENT SAY ACTS SO I'M TRYING TO ENFORCE ACTS BUT TURNS OUT IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN WHATEVER SO. I I HOPE THAT I MEAN I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF COMMUNICATION NEEDS TO HAPPEN AND PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO HEAR DIRECTLY FROM. DEPARTMENT DEPARTMENT THEY'RE GONNA COME UP QUESTIONS THE DEPARTMENT'S GOING TO HAVE TO ANSWER THAT AND ACTUALLY THAT BECOMES YOU KNOW A RULING THAT EVERYONE ELSE KNOWS RIGHT BUT INSTEAD EVERYONE. TRYING OF THIS LATER THINKS IT'S THIS NOW THEIR THINGS IT'S THAT. IS IT'S THAT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MAYBE YOUR THAT IS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE IS THAT ISSUE THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. OKAY YEAH SO WITH SO I THINK THE AND AND THAT CAN'T START HAPPENING AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO SEC IN MANY WAYS IT BECAUSE THEY ALL HAVE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS RIGHT THEN PEOPLE OF THAT SIDE WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO WHAT THEY'RE NOT THE ON SATURDAY I CAN IF I CAN. I'M IN THE LEAD TIMES ARE MUCH LONGER. FOR YOU KNOW NONPROFIT SET UP BOARDS THAT HAVE TO RUN YOU KNOW THE CHANGES YOU KNOW AND GET YOUR GET IT GET THAT APPROVED WOULD GO BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS BUT ALSO THEY HAVE TO TALK WITH THEIR FAMILIES AT THEIR SERVING. WITH THE PEOPLE THERE SERVING IN HIS ANXIETY LEVEL THERE AGAIN I YOU KNOW I PLUGGED THE DEPARTMENT FOR TRYING TO WORK WITH US BUT THERE'S SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY. OF AND ANDERS PROVIDERS WHO ARE TRYING TO MOVE ON THEIR OWN TO BE COMPLIANT. BUT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO AND AND SO TO YOUR POINT. AND ALSO LEGISLATURE CAN DO SOMETHING THEY CAN ACTUALLY INCORPORATE ALL THE GOOD ELEMENTS OF THE CBS ROLL INTO STATE LAW [inaudible] THAT'S BUT I GUESS THERE'S NOT A BIG PLOT FOR THAT BUT IT BUT BUT YOU KNOW THAT IS A WAY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO GET INVOLVED. CARE FOR YOU ASK. FOR IN THE SECOND I SAID THAT I WHICH IS KIND OF THINKING OF A DOWN SO -- BECAUSE WELL I THINK WHAT WE WANT IS IS THAT WE WANT TO TRY TO GET AS MUCH LATITUDE AS POSSIBLE FROM THE FED SO THAT THE STATE CAN THEN HAVE LATITUDE TO WORK WITH BECAUSE RECOGNIZING IN THE END. THE YOU KNOW. EVERY PROVIDERS GOING TO HAVE A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THERE THAT'S GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF SENSE AND IS A SHOULD BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO BUT THAT AND THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT SAID INSIDE A BOX RIGHT BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER UP YOU GO THE MORE LAYS YOU. GO UP THE MORE YOU KNOW IT THE RADICAL IT GETS LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY AND SO -- SO AND DEPENDING ON WHA FEDERAL AGENCY WE'RE DEALING WITH THAT THE FEDERAL AGENCY HOW STRICT THEY WANT TO BE AND THEN THAT HOW THAT GETS OPPOSED TO DOWN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO. I APPRECIATE EVERYONE NEEDS TO KNOW WHAT. FIRST OF ALL YOU I KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO BUT THEN WHEN YOU SUDDENLY REALIZE WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO YOU MIGHT PUSH BACK AND SAY WELL THAT'S NOT THE BEST THING FOR MY CLIENT. RIGHT. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IS AN ADVOCATE THEN THE QUESTIONS HOUSE I GET TRANSLATED BACK UP. AND HOW HE LEADS US TO GO UP SO ANYWAY -- THAT EIGHTY HERE WHAT THE WE NEED TO DO AND CERTAINLY WE'RE GONNA BE VERY INTERESTED SUMMIT OVER SEVEN BILLION IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T DO ANY LAWS IS MORE ABOUT THE OVERSIGHT FUNCTION AND BEING SURE THAT -- WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE MOVING ON THIS CERTAINLY I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PROMISE BUT I THINK IF PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THE AFTER ACTION AND I WAS LOOKING FOR IT TELL. OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO I THINK AS A ANNOUNCED EARLIER WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ISSUES THIS IS ISSUES FOUR THROUGH. EIGHT AGAIN I ASK THAT -- FOR SELF PEOPLE OF COMMON ON ISSUES FOUR THROUGH EIGHT AND I ASK THAT YOU TRY TO KEEP YOUR REMARKS TO A MINUTE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S MORE YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN YOU CAN FEEL FREE. TO SUBMIT WRITTEN COMMENTS -- LATER OR IF YOU HAVE THEM WITH YOU EVEN NOW -- SO WELCOME THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AARON CARUTHERS EXACTED DIRECTOR THE STATE COUNCIL DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES SPEAKING ON ISSUE NUMBER SIX I THINK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT. FOR POINTING OUT IN THE ANALYSIS ABOUT THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT THE LA -- ESTIMATES THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE IN THE SAVINGS FROM OPERATIONAL OPERATING THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS. PRESHEAF MISTER TEARS COMMENTS THAT IN NET THE SYSTEM IS RECEIVING MORE. WEATHER GETS THESE THIS HAD A MILLION DOLLARS ARE NOT THE ONE INVITE THE CHAIR TO CONSIDER THE UNIQUE CHALLENGE THAT HOUSING PLAYS IN REALLY FULFILLING THE PROMISE THE LANTERN ACT. AND WE KNOW HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO THE BEST THING WE COULD DO IS PUT PEOPLE INTO DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AND HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER WE KNOW THE BEST THING TO DO IS KEEP PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITIES. THE REALITY IS IT 63% OF REGIONAL CENTER ADULTS. ADULT CLIENTS ARE LIVING IN A FAMILY HOME. WHICH MEANS THAT THE PROMISED LAND TO ENACT IS BEING DELIVERED ON THE BACKS OF FAMILIES THIS IT AND AND IT'S A POPULATION THAT IS AGING QUICKLY IT'S WHEN IT CAN'T BE SUSTAINED SO I THINK IT'S WHETHER SUCH FOCUS FROM THE ADVOCACY COMMUNITY. ON THIS HUNTER MILLION DOLLARS AS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A DEDICATED REVENUE STREAM THE STATE COUNCIL CREATED A STATEWIDE STRATEGIC PLAN. ON HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES AND WE WOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE IN CONVERSATION THE COMMITTEE ABOUT. SOLUTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE THE POINTING OUT THE AT HOUSING COSTS THANK YOU. NOW THAT IS THE LOCAL V. -- SCA YOU DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES COUNCIL. IN WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE PLANS FOR THE USE OF THE PROPERTY OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AS THEY CLOSE -- WE'RE GLAD TO HEAR THAT THE STATE IS NOT TALKING ABOUT CLEARING THEM SURPLUS. BECAUSE THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THEY CREATED IS CERTAINLY NOT SURPLUS WE CERTAINLY NEED TO DO A LOT MORE TO HELP PROVIDE A HEALTHY AND SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR PEOPLE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES TO LIVE IN -- AND TO THAT PURPOSE I THINK THE REVENUE GENERATED FROM THOSE PROPERTIES SHOULD ON AN ONGOING BASIS BE DEDICATED BACK TO THAT PURPOSE AND NOT SIMPLY. DISAPPEAR. OKAY THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. SENATOR PANDA RICK ROLLINS REPS IN ARKANSAS SHE XIN REGIONAL CENTER AGENCY ADD RESPECT YOUR TIME YOUR YOUR VALUABLE TIME -- JUST WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT QUICKLY ON ITEM NUMBER FIVE SEVEN AND EIGHT ON ITEM FIVE THE FEDERAL CLAIMS REIMBURSEMENT PROJECT. THE STRONG SUPPORT GIVEN THE DEPARTMENT EVERY EFFORT TO GET OUR FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS INTO THE SYSTEM AND I THINK IT'S IN EVERYONE'S BEST A BEST INTEREST THAT HAPPENS IN A TIMELY MATTER -- ITEM NUMBER SEVEN SAFETY NET FACILITIES AND CRISIS -- WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH A D. R. C. AND THE DEPARTMENT -- AND OTHERS ON ON THOSE PROPOSALS TO ME CAPACITY AND OTHER ISSUES SURROUNDING THAT. AN ITEM NUMBER EIGHT SAID OVERVIEW B. C. P. -- WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THE STATE REMAINS IN CONTROL OF THAT PROCESS AND THAT THE CONTRACTOR DOESN'T TAKE OVER CONTROL THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU I WOULD MAKE NOTED STOP MY TIME I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IT'S THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO PRESENTS LATER ON IN THIS HEARING AS WELL AS RESPECT. THEIR TIME. THANK YOU WELCOME WILL SAVE IT FEATURES EXPLORED -- ON ISSUE NUMBER FOR A SPORT THAT YES IS A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL STAFF IN A DDS I REALLY SUPPORT THE LA OWES COMMENT RELATED. TO INNOVATION. EIGHTY BEST IS A WHOLE NEW SYSTEM SELF DETERMINATION IS A WHOLE NEW SYSTEM WE NEED INNOVATION NOT MONITORING WE NEED IMPROVEMENT NOT MONITORING SO I THINK WE NEED TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT FOCUSES RIGHT. AND THEN TO THE COMPLIANCE. WE DO NEED DRECTION SO WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING AND AGAIN WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE ANY CAPACITY WE HAVE TODAY WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. WE NEED TO HELP THAT CAPACITY CHANGE WHAT WE WANTED TO DO THANK YOU THANK YOU. WELCOME MISTER CHAIRMAN AGAIN A CARL LUNDEN YOU'RE ABOUT FOR OF THE ALLIANCE SUPPORTING PEOPLE'S ID DE. I JUST WANT TO ECHO WHAT TO MR SANFORD SAID ALLOWED ONE BRIEF COMMENT. AND THAT IS THERE'S REALLY NOTHING UNDER EACH CBS COMPLIANCE AND THAT WHOLE REGIME THIS COMING. THAT'S CHEAPER THAN ANYTHING WE DO TODAY. SO TO THE EXTENT WERE HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT STICKER SHOCK AND PRICE TAG ISSUES AROUND THE RATES STEADY OR WHAT WE FIND TODAY OR WHAT WE'RE NOT FUNDING. GET READY BECAUSE THE H. CBS REGIME LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO COST MORE TO MATTER WHAT WE DO AND I THINK THAT'S GOING. TO CREATE A VERY SERIOUS POLICY CONSIDERATION FOR YOU IF YOU OF PROGRAMS IN AN AREA. THAT WE SUDDENLY DEEM NOT COMPLIANT UNDER EACH C. B. S. IN THE PROGRAM GOES AWAY AND THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE LOSE THEIR PROGRAM. THAT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT SOME CENTER ALL OF A SUDDEN AS WHEN THE WHEN THE PHONE DOESN'T STOP RINGING. AND THAT'S GONNA BE PARTICULAR PROBLEM WE BELIEVE IN RURAL AREAS -- PERFECTLY WITH REGARDS TO WORK BASED PROGRAMS WHERE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATES IN RURAL AREAS ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN THEY ARE EVERYWHERE ELSE SO. GOING UP THE COMMUNITY IN FINDING AN INTEGRATED JOB WHEN THERE AREN'T JOBS. THAT'S COULD RAISE A WHOLE DIFFERENT KIND OF PROBLEM FOR US TO THINK THROUGH JUST WANNA MAKE YOU WEAR THAT THING OUT THANK YOU AND I UNDERSTAND WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THE RATE STUDY. THE NEXT WEEK SO THAT IN A TO CVS SO WE HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN THAT THANK YOU WELCOME. HI -- I'M EGGMAN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR GOLDEN GATE REGIONAL CENTER WE SERVE TEN THOUSAND FOLKS IN SAN MATTEO. SAN FRANCISCO IN MARIN COUNTY SOME TIMING MYSELF SO BECAUSE I'M NOT KNOWN FOR BREVITY -- I JUST WANTED THERE'S A THEME I GUESS MY COMMENTS GO TO ISSUES FOR SEVEN EIGHT BUT I'M SURE WILL APPLY TO NINE IN SOME WAYS. TO THIS IDEA YOU'VE HEARD TODAY OF THE THREE LAYERS OF THE SYSTEM DEPARTMENT -- REGIONAL CENTERS AND PROVIDER AGENCIES. BEEN MUCH TALK ABOUT THE CAPACITY IN RESPONSIVENESS AND SO WE APPLAUD THE IDEA OF HAVING A SINGLE. DDS -- YOU KNOW ORGANIZATION AROUND A COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES -- AND APPLY THE IDEA OF A STANDARDIZED STATEWIDE DATA SYSTEM BECAUSE WE SHOULD ALL BE MEASURING THE SAME THINGS TO IDENTIFY GAPS -- BUT WITHOUT INVESTMENTS IN THE CAPACITY IN AND RESPONSIVENESS OF REGIONAL CENTERS AND PROVIDER AGENCIES -- ALL THE INVESTMENTS IN MONITORING AND THE LAYERING OF STATUTORY EXPECTATIONS IS NOT CAN IMPROVE THE OUTCOMES FOR THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. AND OWNS SO IN MY THIRTY YEARS AT THAT SEE IT'S BEEN NOT THE WHERE WITH ALL IN SOME CASES NOT EVEN THE MODELS OF SERVICE BUT JUST OUR ABILITY TO HAVE THE RIGHT STAFF TO DO TEM. IF YOU LOOK AT OVER THE LAST TWELVE YEARS FOR GOLDEN GATE REGIONAL CENTER THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR TIRE BUDGET THAT GOES -- TO OPERATIONS HAS GONE FROM 15% IN 2000528% NOW AND THAT'S THE CAPACITY WE LACK TO BE ABLE TO THE THINGS WE WANT THANK YOU THANK YOU. WELCOME. JUDY MARK DISABILITY VOICES NINE PARENT -- ON SAFETY NET -- WE WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT AT HOME. AND THAT MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO ALLOW THEM TO HAVE HEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVERS TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE STAFF FOR PEOPLE WITH HIGHER NEEDS AND WE DIDN'T HEAR A LOT ABOUT THAT TODAY BUT WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT IT. TAKES TOO LONG TO GET THOSE APPROVED AS WELL AS WE SUPPORT THE DRC PROPOSAL THAT ALLOWS FOR MORE OF THESE MOBILE CRISIS UNITS TO KEEP PEOPLE HOME. ON THE H. CBS ISSUE -- YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW WITH THEIR NEEDS TO BE MORE INFORMATION TO PROVIDERS.

AND THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE GONNA BE AFFECTED THE MOST. ON AND I ALSO I JUST WANT TO TAKE A DECENT DIFFERENT ISSUES I DON'T THINK THAT EACH CBS COMPLIANT. SETTINGS ARE NECESSARILY MORE EXPENSIVE I AM A VERY BIG FAN OF THIS RULE I BELIEVE THAT IT IS WHAT ARE. MY SON WANTS IS TO BE INTEGRATED IN THE COMMUNITY AND IT MEANS THAT INSTEAD OF GOING TO SEPARATE PROGRAMS WHERE YOU'RE WITH PEOPLE DISABILITIES ALL DAY YOU'RE GOING TO THE BOYS GOT YOU'RE GOING TO WIND CA. YOU'RE GOING TO OUR CLASS AND YOU ARE PAYING FOR SOMEONE TO SUPPORT YOU TO BE INTEGRATED IN THE COMMUNITY. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IS MORE EXPENSIVE IT IS A DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT SUPPORTING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES [inaudible] THANK YOU.

I THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR YOUR SINK COMMENTS AND APPRECIATE THE INPUT SO WOULD LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER -- SEVEN WHICH IS DISPARITIES FUNDING. SORRY NINE SORRY NINE ISSUE NUMBER NINE DISPARITIES FUNDING SORRY THANK YOU FOR THE CORRECTION YES. ALL RIGHT. AND THE OTHER PANEL FOR THIS TOO OKAY [inaudible] ALL RIGHT [inaudible] OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO IF THREE PEOPLE FOR PANEL OF BECOMING A LEADER RIGHT [inaudible] RIGHT. OKAY SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND BEGIN WITH -- THE AGENCY THANK YOU APARTMENT THANK YOU -- I'VE BEEN ASKED -- TO ADDRESS THREE THREE QUESTIONS AND INTO CONSIDERATION OF TIME ILL GO AHEAD AND REALLY FOCUS ON THOSE -- BUT I I DO WANT -- TO JUST BRIEFLY SPEAK ABOUT -- THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS -- THERE'S BEEN A COMMITMENT -- TO LOOK AT HOW TO ADDRESS THIS -- REALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANT ISSUE AS FAR AS IN EQUITY A SPENDING AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE REALLY UNDERSTANDING THE SERVICES -- AND BARRIERS TO ACCESSING SERVICES -- FOR THE COMMUNITIES -- AND TAKING A LOOK AT WHERE THERE'S DISPARITIES -- MANY WE THERE'S SOME HISTORY THAT I'VE AND I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND AND NOT SPEAK TO JUST BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE HAD OPPORTUNITIES IN THE PAST. BUT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS THAT WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE DOING NOW TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS AND ADDRESS THE ISSUES. SO THE ONE OF THE AREAS IS REALLY LOOKING AT THE USE OF THE ELEVEN MILLION MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE TYING THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE IN UNDERSTANDING THE PURCHASE OF SERVICE -- INFORMATION THAT TELLS US WHERE WE HAVE INEQUITIES IN THE DIFFERENT REGIONAL CENTERS AND THEN ACROSS THE STATE. AND THEN THROUGH THAT WORK WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT HOW DO WE USE THE LEVIN MILLION TO PRIORITIZE HOW TO MOVE THAT FORWARD. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS -- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SUPPORT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR PROJECTS ON THE LAST TWO YEARS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO USE IT AS A GRANT PROGRAM AND SUPPORTING COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS -- WHERE THERE'S -- REAL FOCUS ON KIND OF A GRASS ROOTS OR IT LOOKING AT HOW ON THE COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES CAN PROVIDE -- THE SUPPORT TO NAVIGATING THROUGH THE SYSTEM WE'VE SEEN SOME REALLY GREAT THINGS AS FAR AS DIFFERENT PROPOSALS THAT'S FOCUSED ON DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO WE WE DO HAVE A SUMMARY OF THOSE PROPOSALS AND SO AGAIN IN THE CONSIDERATION OF TIME WE'LL GO AHEAD AND YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT IT WILL HAVE A MONTH ON OUR WEBSITE WILL MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE AVAILABLE FOR FOLKS IS A SUMMARY. BUT WHAT WE DO IS THAT AS A DEPARTMENT IN ADDITION TO THE STAKEHOLDER WORK THAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS DO WE ALSO I ANNUALLY REACH OUT TO STAKEHOLDERS THIS YEAR WAS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. INSTEAD OF DOING A BROAD REVIEW WHAT WE DID IS WE DID A FOCUSED -- KIND OF PRESENCE IN THE COMMUNITY AND WE TALKED -- TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT -- WERE IN A PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC AREA THAT WE HAD HEARD CONCERNED SO WE WENT TO THE COUNTRY COACHELLA VALLEY AND WE HAD STAFF THAT MET WITH THE COMMUNITY THERE. THE OTHER IS TO TAKE A LOOK A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE ALSO MET WITH A FOCUS GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS. WITHIN THE DEAF COMMUNITY -- THAT -- USE A SL AS A LANGUAGE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY BARRIERS IN ACCESSING SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY EACH OTHER REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE A CULTURAL SPECIALIST WE AS A DEPARTMENT PROVIDE A MONTHLY CALLS TO UNDERSTAND KIND OF THE EFFORTS THAT THEY'RE DOING WITHIN THEIR PLANS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES TALKING ABOUT BEST PRACTICES HOW WE CAN GO AHEAD AND REPLICATE SOME OF THOSE BEST PRACTICES -- WE'VE ALSO STARTED WORKING ON TAKING A LOOK AT THE DATA -- WHEN WE FIRST MOVED FORWARD WITH THE -- PROPOSALS -- WITH ELEVEN MILLION WE WE ESTABLISHED -- MEASURES THAT WE'RE GOING TO WHICH IS OUTLINED IN THE AGENDA THAT WE'RE GOING TO USE TO MEASURE -- THE BASIS FOR THAT WAS -- FIFTEEN SIXTEEN FUNDING THAT WE HAD -- WITHIN THE MEASURES WHICH AGAIN IS POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE. IS THAT THE REPORTING OUT OF THE PROGRESS -- ON ON MEASURING HOW WE'RE WERE IMPROVING IN THE AREA OF LOW -- REDUCING THAT GAP AS FAR AS THE INEQUITY OF SPENDING IS THAT WOULD BE THROUGH EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FUNDING. SO SINCE IT'S THROUGH EIGHTEEN NINETEEN OUR REPORT AND BEING ABLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE MEASURES IS GOING TO BE AT THE END OF THIS YEAR. YOU KNOW SO WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE EXPENDITURES WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT AND LIKELY HAVE A UP A REPORT THAT'S RESPONSIVE TO THE MEASURES THAT WE HAVE COMMITTED -- TO REPORTING ON ON THE FIRST PART OF THE CALENDAR YEAR NEXT YEAR. I'VE BEEN ASKED -- IF WE PROVIDE ANY SUPPORT OR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE RECIPIENTS OF THE GRANTS PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT ARE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AND WE DO -- WHEN WHEN WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO AWARD THE GRANTS WHAT WE DID THIS YEAR IS THAT WE ALSO HAD KIND OF A MANDATED TO SPEAK YOU KNOW -- CALL WITH THEM TO SAY OKAY LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THE THE GRANT IS AND HOW YOU AS IN A AR DE ARE RESPONSIBLE TO THAT GRANTS TO THE MEASURES AND HOW ARE YOU GOING TO REPORT THAT BACK AND AND AND AT LET THEM HAVE SOME -- OPPORTUNITIES TO ASK QUESTIONS SO WE CAN PROVIDE THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS WELL. I'M SO WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY IT IS AN AREA THAT I'VE I'VE PARTICULARLY BEEN VERY PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO BE A PART OF THAT LISTENING TO THE COMMUNITY MYSELF -- AND I AM VERY PLEASED TO SEE MNY OTHER PROJECTS THAT ARE GOING FORWARD -- I DO HAVE TO GIVE A LOT OF ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO A PARTICULAR GROUP THAT. HAS KIND OF BEEN MY VOICE YOU KNOW THAT HAS SHARED THEIR CONCERNS AS A GROUP AND I'D THERE'S THESE WONDERFUL MOMS THAT ARE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT STARTED. MEETING WITH ME A FEW YEARS AGO DAVID THROUGH THEIR WORK THEY REALLY START TAKING FOR THROUGH THE GRANTS AND THEY WERE ABLE. TO KIND OF BE THAT THAT VOICE TO CHANGE OUR APPROACH AND SO I I DO WANT TO THANK THEM AND I KNOW THEY KNOW WHO THEY KNOW WHO THEY ARE. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT COMES MILLENNIAL FINANCE ALL RIGHT -- AND WE HAVE A PANEL HERE -- IN THE WEST WING -- FROM THAT YOU'RE BACK FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF VISUAL CENTER AGENCIES AND FERNANDO GOMEZ -- BOARD MEMBER DISPLAY VOICES UNITED AND THEN MARIO MOTO -- BACK AGAIN AS WELL SO WHAT WE JUST GO IN THAT ORDER AND AGAIN ASK THAT YOU TRY TO KEEP YOUR REMARKS TO WITHIN THREE MINUTES. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR PAN. FIRST AND FOREMOST I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT REGIONAL CENTERS ARE ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO ENSURING EQUAL ACCESS TO SERVICES. TO THOSE SERVICES THAT PEOPLE VALUE AND THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO HELP THEM LEAD THE LIVES THEY ENVISION. THE DISPARITY FUNDS HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE FOR THREE YEARS NOW AND HAVE PROVIDED AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO ESSENTIALLY HI WITH INTERVENTIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND SEE WHAT WORKS. TO GIVE US A CHANCE TO SEE WHAT WORKS TO IMPROVE THIS ACCESS TO CRITICAL SERVICES. FROM SOME PRELIMINARY INFORMATION WE KNOW THAT A COUPLE OF THINGS REALLY DO SEEM TO BE EFFECTIVE THE PROMO TORA MODEL. PROVIDES NOT ONLY [inaudible] SERVICES. TWO PEOPLE BUT SOME OF THE OUTCOMES THAT WE SEE FROM IT. IS THAT PEOPLE REPORT GREATER CONFIDENCE IN ACCESSING SERVICES. FAMILIES REPORT THAT THEY FEEL MORE SUPPORTED. THEY REPORT THAT THEY ARE ACCESSING NOT ONLY MORE BUT A WIDER ARRAY OF SERVICES AVAILABLE THROUGH THE REGIONAL CENTER. THEY UNDERSTAND THE SERVICES BETTER. AND THAT THEY'RE ACCESSING MORE COMMUNITY RESOURCES AS WELL BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT REGIONAL CENTERS AREN'T THE ONLY PLACE WHERE PEOPLE WERE DROPPED SERVICES FROM. SO THEY'RE ACCESSING SPECIAL EDUCATION MEDI CAL TRANSPORTATION FOOD BANKS ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT ENABLE THEM TO THEN FOCUS ON THEIR CHILD'S DISABILITY. WE ALSO KNOW THAT CASELOAD SMALLER CASELOAD RATIOS WORK AND THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN PURCHASE OF SERVICE WHEN. PEOPLE ARE ON A SMALLER CASELOAD THAT'S TARGETED TO THEM. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THESE INTERVENTIONS ARE LIMITED TO VERY SMALL POPULATIONS. AND SO THE NEXT STEP IS ONCE WE CAN AGREE THAT INTERVENTIONS WORK. THROUGH ROBUST INFORMATION THAT THEY ARE MAKING PROGRESS WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP HOW DO WE TAKE THOSE TARGETED SMALL PILOTS. AND MAKE THEM MORE BROADLY AVAILABLE WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS ADVOCACY GROUPS AND OTHERS TO THAT END. AND APPRECIATE THE WILLINGNESS OF DISABILITY VOICES UNITED TO SIT DOWN AND MEET WITH US TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE NEXT STEPS WERE WE CAN FIND. PLACES WHERE WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. WE AGREE THAT SERVICES AGAIN NEED TO BE RESPONSIVE TO INDIVIDUAL NEEDS TO FAMILY AND CULTURAL PREFERENCES AND THAT THEY NEED TO BE FLEXIBLE AND AGAIN BACK TO THE ISSUE OF SOCIAL RECKON CAMP AS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF SOME OF THE SERVICES THAT PEOPLE VALUE. THAT MAY NOT COST A LOT BUT MADE A BIG IMPACT IN THEIR LIVES THANK YOU. YES. THANK YOU CENTER AND THE VICE PRESIDENT OF DISABILITY VOICES UNITED THEN. MORE IMPORTANTLY I AM THE FATHER TO WONDERFUL VOICE BY TWELVE YEAR OLD SON -- SCOTT I'M TONY OF OUR HAS DOWN SYNDROME IS ALSO A REGIONAL CENTER CLIENT. DISABILITY VOICES UNITED HAS REVIEWED POS DATA FROM THE LAST TWO YEARS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE GRANTS TO REGIONAL CENTERS AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS HAVE REDUCE DISPARITIES. WE HAVE A SHOULD REPORT TO A REALITY CHECK HERE. THAT ACTUALLY. SHOWS THAT. DISPARITIES HAVE NOT DECREASED BUT ACTUALLY INCREASED -- AND BY FAR WITHIN THAT THE THE INCREASE LATINOS CONTINUE TO FACE THE GREATEST LEVEL OF DISPARITIES AS THE LARGEST ETHNIC GROUP SERVED BY THE SYSTEM. AND THREE YEARS INTO DISPARITY EFFORTS MY COMMUNITY. CONTINUES TO RECEIVE THE LOS AMOUNTS OF SERVICES. THE DATA SHOWS THAT IN EVERY SINGLE REGIONAL CENTER LATINOS GET ABOUT HALF TE AMOUNT OF SERVICES COMPARED TO WHITES. AT FIVE REGIONAL CENTERS LATINOS RECEIVE ONLY A THIRD OR ACTUALLY LESS. OF WHAT WHITES RECEIVE AND THINGS SEEM TO BE WORSE. REGIONAL CENTERS WITH THE LARGEST POPULATION OF LATINOS FOR EXAMPLE ONCE AGAIN CALIFORNIA REGIONAL CENTER. WHO HAS A ABOUT A 68% LATINO POPULATION OR OF CONSUMERS RECEIVES ABOUT 18% OF WHAT WHITES RECEIVING SERVICES? SO WE RICH APPRECIATE AND TO RESPECT THE DEPARTMENT AND THE LEGISLATOR. FOR ALL THE EFFORTS OF THE MADE. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT REGIONAL CENTERS TO A LOT OF THINGS VERY WELL -- TODAY AND OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN IN THIS ONE AREA WITHIN DISPARITIES [inaudible] WE ASK WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE THE FIRST WE BELIEVE THAT MANY REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE NOT MEANINGFULLY INCLUDED. INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE AFFECTED BY DISPARITIES IN THEIR PLANNING. SO PEOPLE WHO FACE DISPARITIES ARE ACTUALLY THE BEST EXPERTS AT WHAT THEY ARE AND HOW THAT CAN BE HELPED. SECOND THE FUNDS THAT WERE ALLOCATED. BASED ON THE LEVEL OF DISPARITY IN A PARTICULAR AREA OR HOW THEY WILL ACTUALLY REDUCE DISPARITIES IS GOING TO BE A KEY ISSUE. AND THIRD THERE REALLY IS NO INDEPENDENT EVALUATIONS OF THE FUNDED PROGRAMS TO SEE THEIR IMPACT. FINALLY IT IS TIME THAT WE ARE HONEST ABOUT THE FACT THAT MANY IN MY COMMUNITY REPORT FEELING INTIMIDATED BY THE SYSTEM. THAT ARE SOMETIMES AFRAID TO SPEAK UP IN FEAR RETALIATION AGAINST THEM IN THEIR CHILD. SO WE NEED TO REALLY STOP DENYING THE FACT THAT. THE REAL BY A SUCCESS AND WE NEED TO STOP CONTRIBUTING DISPARITIES TO ACTUALLY ETHNIC CULTURES OF FAMILIES. WE NEED TO REALLY STOP MAKING EXCUSES THAT'S WHY DISABILITY VOICES UNITED THIS REQUEST IN THAT A SMALL PORTION. OF NEXT YEAR'S ELEVEN MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET GO TO AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATIONS OF THE PROCESS THAT'S USED TO DETERMINE GRANTS AND WHETHER THE FUNDED PROJECTS. ACTUALLY REDUCE DISPARITIES. THE RESULTS OF THE INDEPENDENT EVALUATIONS CAN BE SHARED. SO THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE A TRANSPARENT AND COLLABORATIVE PATH TOWARD AND EQUITABLE SYSTEM. THANK YOU THANK YOU. PARDEE MODEM OF FAMILY MEMBERS CALIFORNIA DISPLACING YOUR COMMITTEE ACTION NETWORK ALSO A MEMBER OF THE DDS DIRECTORS DISPARITIES ADVISORY. COMMITTEE. YEAH AND I AGREE -- THAT -- THE DDS HAS TAKEN SOME GOOD STEPS -- TOWARDS REDUCING DISPARITIES BUT THERE'S A SENSE OF URGENCY -- AS A FAMILY MEMBER AND AS AN ADVOCATE. YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THE IMPACT OF DISPARITIES IS NOT JUST SOMEONE LOSING A SERVICE ARE NOT GETTING A SERVICES SOMEONE BEING HARMED. ESPECIALLY INFANTS IN NEED OF EARLY START EARLY INTERVENTION -- AND I THINK WHEN SOMEONE IS FACING DISCRIMINATION OR BARRIERS DUE TO DISCRIMINATION DUE TO OF DISPARITIES. IT'S HARD TO BE PATIENT AND HARD NOT TO FEEL THAT THE SITUATION IS ANYTHING BUT URGENT AND THAT AND AND NOT ENOUGH IS BEING DONE SUGGESTIONS. YOU KNOW TO THE STATE INTO THE LEGISLATURE IS THAT. DDS SHOULD REPLICATE BEST PRACTICES BY THE GRANTEES -- IN LINK THOSE AS A BASIS FOR TARGETED FUNDING INCREASES TIED TO MEASURING OUTCOMES -- HAVE THOSE DISPARITY FUNDING GRANTEES TRAIN OTHER PROVIDERS. AND COMMUNITY STAKE HOLDERS SO THAT THEY CAN REPLICATE WHAT THEY HAVE DONE. I'VE TALKED TO SOME THE GRANTEES AND DDS TO CONDUCT MONTHLY OR BI MONTHLY CALLS SO THAT THE GRANTEES AND THE STATE CAN EXCHANGE INFORMATION ON HOW THEIR GRANTS ARE GOING IN ANY PROBLEMS -- ENCOUNTERING TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY. LASTLY -- THE ISSUE OF DISPARITIES CROSSES SYSTEM LINES AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO RECOGNIZE THAT COULD WE DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS IS PROBLEMS IT JUST BURIES A MEDI CAL I JUST SAYS SPECIAL ED. HOUSING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IDENTITY HEARING WHERE IT WAS THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT OF TWO MILLION CHILDREN. ON MEDI CAL WHO WERE NOT RECEIVING A PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THE ISSUE IN PART WAS DUE TO DISPARITIES. AND I THINK ONE THING IS THAT CAN HELP ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM IS THAT. DID ISSUED DISPARITIES IS NOT. JUST IN THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. LEASE WITHIN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ONE SUGGESTION IS THAT THE AGENCY BRING TOGETHER ALL THE DEPARTMENTS AND THE STAKEHOLDERS TO LOOK AT HOW TOGETHER WE CAN. TO RESOLVE DISPARITIES OR REDUCE DISPARITIES DISPARITIES OR PERSON FROM THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR LIKE FOR NOT DOING ME. WE DON'T LIVE IN A SILO IS WHOLE PERSON THE WHOLE ISSUE NOW IS ABOUT HOPE PERSON CARE AND SO THE APPROACH TOWARDS REDUCING DISPARITIES SB TAKEN IN THAT SAME MANNER. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU SO. THREE YEARS OF MONEY. AND THINGS ARE WORSE SO. WATCH WHAT WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE -- SENATOR PAN AYE I'M NOT. I I CAN'T SPEAK TO KIND OF WHAT THE INFORMATION THAT INFORMED THEIR REVIEW. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE INFORMATION. RIGHT -- SO DO WE BUT THE HAVE ALTERNATIVE DATA THEN SO WELL THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AS FAR AS THE MEASURES THAT I WAS -- SPEAKING TO I DO WANT TO MAKE NOTE AS TO THE TIMING OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GRANT SO THE FINDINGS WERE AVAILABLE IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN RIGHT -- IMPLEMENTING THE SERVICES AND HAVING THE FIRST PROJECTS START. REALLY HAS ONLY BEEN IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND SOWHENYOU START -- OKAY SO THEY'VE BEEN DOING PROGRAMS FOR TWO YEARS DAVE NOT RIGHT SO WE JUST HAD OUR OUR FIRST -- PROJECTS FROM THAT WERE APPROVED I'M JUST SUBMITTED THEIR FINAL REPORTS TO US IN DECEMBER. SO WE REALLY ARE IN THE VERY EARLY STAGES. OF LOOKING AT THE DATA AND LOOKING AT THE INFORMATION. ARE YOU LOOKING AT THE OVER I MEAN THERE'S PROJECT ON FRIDAY AND WHILE OVERALL CORRECT CORRECT BUT THE OPPORTUNITY SO ALL I'M I JUST WANT TO KIND OF POINT OUT IS THAT. A POINT OF INFORMATION IS THAT WE HAVE THE PROJECTS THAT JUST RECENTLY STARTED SO THE IMPACTS TO A BROADER SYSTEM. YOU KNOW WE STILL HAVE WE STILL HAVE TO DO SOME KIND OF DIGGING INTO THE DATA TO SEE WHAT THOSE IMPACTS ARE. THE OTHER POINT THAT I'D LIKE TO JUST MAKE AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S INFLUENCE ENOUGH BUT IT'S TAKING TIME TO REALLY. KIND OF GET INTO THE INFORMATION AND DOING OUR ANALYSIS IS THERE'S BEEN QUITE A BIT A DIFFERENT POLICY. THAT HAS ALSO CHANGED SOME OF THE THE EFFORTS AT OR THE EXPENDITURES WITHIN OUR PURCHASE A SERVICE DATA I DON'T KNOW WHAT INFLUENCE THAT HAS ON IT. SO IT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT OUR EXPENDITURES TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE INFORMATION THAT IS NOT ONLY REGIONAL. WITHIN EACH REGIONAL CENTER BUT STATEWIDE. SO NOT SAYING THAT THESE ARE NOT IMPORTANT ISSUES BECAUSE I CERTAINLY AM. BUT I AM SAYING THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO RESPOND TO SAY WHETHER. WE ARE LOOKING AT IT AND THE TOTALITY THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO REPORT -- WHETHER THERE IS PROGRESS OR NO PROGRESS OKAY SO. SIDE DEBT. SO THE THING IS I FOOD BECAUSE THIS WAY -- I THINK YOU KNOW THIS IS URGENT. EIGHT BECAUSE DISPARITIES ARE QUITE SEVERE AND THE LEAST. THE HEARING MAY BE WORSE RIGHT I AM NOT HEARING A LOT OF LIKE -- GOT A LOT BETTER I MEAN MAYBE MAYBE DETAILS WE'LL SEE HOW MUCH MARGINAL CHANGE OR IS -- BUT THANK YOU KNOW AND EVERY AND EVERY. YEAR THAT GOES BY THAT'S ANOTHER GROUP. RIGHT I MEAN AND SO I CAN GO WINE BACK TIME AND SIX IT FOR THEM. SO I THINK THERE'S A TREMENDOUS URGENCY I THINK THAT WAS EXPRESSED BY THE LEGISLATURE WE FIRST ALLOCATED THE MONEY. THAT THIS IS PROBLEMATIC -- PEOPLE ASK ME SO HOW'S THINGS GOING AND I'M GOING WELL I GUESS WE'LL FIND OUT SO AND RIGHT NOW I'M NOT GONNA BILL SURE ANY GOOD NEWS WITH THEM YET -- AND DAIRY EXPECT TO HAVE THEY WANT TO SEE MAJOR CHANGES AND AND THAT. AND EIGHT YOU KNOW APPRECIATE PEOPLE OF THESE LITTLE PROJECTS HERE BUT I'M WE'RE TALKING MAJOR CULTURAL CHANGE. THE OTHER THING THAT I'M HEARING. AS VERY DISTURBED -- FROM MISTER GOMEZ IS IS THAT PEOPLE FEEL INTIMIDATED -- EITHER WAY I'M ALSO SIT ON THE COMMITTEE HUMAN SERVICES WE JUST HAD A BILL SOMEONE ACTUALLY SUBMITTED BECAUSE THEY SAID DOES INTIMIDATION GOING ON AT THE CENTERS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON THERE WHY WHY WHY IS EVERYONE TALKING ABOUT TO MEDIATION. I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE AS FAR AS THE ON THE INTIMIDATION NOW WE HAVE YOU KNOW AND AND MISTER GOMEZ AND OTHERS HAVE SHARED THOSE CONCERNS. AND IS. LOOKING AT THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WHAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND ANY TIME. CERTAINLY THAT WE'VE HEARD THE CONCERNS WE REACT TO IT BUT THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER WE GOT A CHANGE THE CULTURE AS FAR AS THE RELATIONSHIP AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS A SAFE PLACE. FOR FOR FAMILIES TO GO AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THOSE RESOURCES SO WHEN. WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE PROPOSAL'S IT'S LIKE WHAT ARE THE PROPOSALS ARE THE ACTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE TAKEN? TO HELP. YOU KNOW ADDRESS THAT SIGNIFICANT ISSUE BECAUSE INTIMIDATION IS NOT OKAY NO IT'S NOT -- TAKING A LOOK AT SO FOR EXAMPLE -- YOU KNOW USING THE PERMIT TORAH MODEL HAS BEEN A VERY VERY GOOD PROJECT THAT HAS BEEN REPLICATED OVER DIFFERENT. ON REGIONAL CENTERS CATCHMENT AREAS AND THEY BEEN MODELS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE BASED ON COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. SO HERE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE TRUST WITHIN THE COMMUNITY THAT IS SO CRITICAL. TO REALLY START CHANGING KIND OF THAT CULTURE AND HELPING MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S THAT VOICE NOW WHEN WE DO SO WE HAVE TO DO IT TOO I SEE TWO PATHS THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE WITH IT WHAT IS THAT PREVENTATIVE PATH TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CHANGING THAT CULTURE. AND THEN ALSO MAKING SURE THAT IF WE DO AS AN APARTMENT HERE THAT THERE IS LEVELS OF INTIMIDATION THAT WE STARTED DRESSING THOSE ISSUES AND MAKE AND HOLDING REGIONAL CENTERS ACCOUNTABLE. TO TO FIX KIND OF THEIR CULTURE YOU THERE'S A REASON WHY IF THERE IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING ON WE NEED TO HAVE A A PLAN. TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A SAFE PLACE TO HAVE SERVICES WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S CHANGES THAT HAVE HAPPENED AS FAR AS IMMIGRATION AND EVERYTHING BUT THE HEIGHTENED. KIND OF THE THE FEAR OF PURE KIND OF FIGHT A BUREAUCRACY OR AN ORGANIZATION. IN GOVERNMENT AND SO REGIONAL CENTERS BY WAY OF WHO KIND OF THEY ARE THEY'RE KIND OF A QUIET SIGH YOU KNOW GOVERNMENT AND THERE'S THIS. YOU KNOW FEAR THAT CAN BE INHERENTLY THERE BUT THEN WHEN YOU ADD KIND OF OTHER RELATIONSHIP THING SECOND KIND OF MAGNIFY THAT. SO WE DO HAVE SOME REALLY GREAT PROPOSALS I AM VERY VERY PLEASED WITH SOME OF THE PROPOSALS I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE'RE NOT CONCERNED AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS SO CRITICAL TO PAY ATTENTION. TO AN UNDERSTANDING KIND OF THE SYSTEM WIDE KINDA MEASURING THAT PROGRESS BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE MEASURES WITH PARTICULAR PROJECTS WE ARE SEEING THAT THERE'S IN INCREASE AND PURCHASE A SERVICE WE ARE SEEING THAT THERE'S A REDUCTION IN SOME OTHER AREAS. SO WE DO HAVE SOME PROJECT BASED THAT WE ARE SEEING SOME EVIDENCE OF REALLY GOOD PRACTICES THAT ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE. SO IT'S TAKING THAT NEXT STEP IS SAYING OKAY HOW DO WE TAKE A LOOK AT THIS MORE ON AT A LARGER SKILLS SO NGUYEN. SO WHENEVER YOU MOVE THE NEEDLE ON ON THIS ISSUE SO GIVE ME A TIME. WHEN DO I GET A REPORT DISHES WE MADE A MAJOR MOVE IN THE DISPARITY NUMBERS? I I CANNOT ANSWER THAT FOR YOU I MEAN IS IT IS LIKE THE MAJOR MAY WELL AS IT TWO YEARS THREE YEARS FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS I MEAN THAT'S SO WHAT WE HAVE SO I DOVE SO WE HAVE PILOTS WHO CAN AND REPORTS REPORTS ARE GONNA COME OUT. THEN YOU'RE DOWN THEN THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO TELL ALL YOU KNOW THE CENTERS LIKE YOURS THE BEST PRACTICES AND YOU NEED TO DO THIS OR ELSE RIGHT AND AND MIDDLE MOVES STRAIGHT SO. I THAT WE HAVE OUR MEASURES WHICH WHEN IS THE FINAL YEAR OF THAT. THE THE REPORT. ON SO EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND THEN IT'S ANNUALLY AFTER THAT RIGHT SO ARE SO WE HAVE YEAH SO EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS AS ALWAYS SEEN ON OUR MEASURES THAT WAS THE POINT IN TIME THAT WE'RE USING TO MEASURE. TO FIFTEEN SIXTEEN TO SEE A FOR MOVING THAT NEEDLE OKAY IN THAT REPORT YOU SAID THE END OF THE YEAR THAT RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO BE USING PURCHASED A SERVICE DATA THAT ENDS DECEMBER. TWENTY NINETEEN SO -- THAT WILL HAVE THAT INFORMATION SO WE'LL SEE -- THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE A REPORT EARLY PART OF NEXT YEAR. AND THAT IS THAT COMPREHENSIVE MEASURE REPORTERS THAT'S THE OVERALL ACROSS THE SYSTEM CORRECT ON THE MEASURES THAT ARE ACTUALLY LISTED IN YOUR AGENDA. AND THEN YOU ALSO ARE LOOKING AT THE INDIVIDUAL PRIDE I MEAN YOU'VE BEEN FUNDING THEM FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW. LOOKING AT THE INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS AND THEN THOUGH AS I WAS SAYING THE FIRST YEAR PROJECTS WE JUST RECEIVED THEIR FINAL REPORT. AT THE END OF DECEMBER AND SO WE'RE JUST IN THAT THERE WERE FINALIZING KIND OF THOSE. THAT -- OKAY SO OUTCOMES AT THIS TIME OKAY SO WHAT AT WHAT POINT. THEN DE USE THAT [inaudible] THIS. TWELVE CAN NOW THAT YOU HAVE THE INFORMATION FROM THESE PILOTS. WHAT POINT DO YOU SAY OKAY WELL WE CAN TAKE THE BEST OF THAT AND EVERYONE HAS TO DO IT WELL. WE ARE WERE REVIEWING THOSE WERE NOT WAITING FOR JUST OKAY. TO A MOM AS FAR AS EVERYBODY HAS TO DO IT I THINK THAT THOSE THAT'S PART OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WERE LOOKING OUT AS FAR AS THOSE BEST PRACTICES. BUT WE'RE ALSO STILL USING THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY YOU KNOW IF THERE ARE SOME BEST PRACTICES OR REPLICATING WE DON'T WANT TO WAIT. SO WE ARE SEEING THAT WE ARE DOING SOME REPLICATION OF PROJECTS THAT ARE SHOWING EVIDENCE OF PROGRESS AND SO FOR EXAMPLE I MEAN WE HAVE. ALL RIGHT I'D I'D HAVE TO GET YOU THE NUMBER BUT THE NUMBER OF FROM A TORAH MODELS OR NAVIGATORS OR TAKING A LOOK AT EXPANDING KIND OF THE THAT THE THAT OUT REACH THAT FAMILIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO FROM THAT ORGANIC KIND OF GRASS ROOTS. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REPLICATE THAT SO WE DON'T WANT TO WAIT. SO WE DO WANT TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOING PROGRESS ON ANNUAL BASIS AS OPPOSED TO WAIT ON IT AND AND AND AND NOT SAYING WAIT BUT A WHAT POINT DOES IT ACTUALLY REACH SCALE. UNDERSTOOD RIGHT NOW I MEAN. WHAT POINT IS A READ SCALE BECAUSE AGAIN IT COMES DOWN? TO WHEN DO WE SEE A MAJOR CHANGE IN THOSE NUMBERS RIGHT SO BECAUSE IF EVERYONE EVERYTHING STAYS PILOTS. WE'RE NOT MOVING THE BIG NUMBER SO I MAY MOVE A LITTLE NUMBER FOR THE PILOT PHOSPHORYLATION BUT THEN WE GOT AND THEN MOVES TO CHANGING THE NUMBER. SO THAT MEANS TAKING THE MOST EFFECTIVE THINGS AND BRING IT TO SCALE RIGHT THAT MEANS WELL ALMOST EVERYBODY DOES IT MAYBE THERE'S SOME PLACES WHERE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BUT ESSENTIALLY USE STAR ROLE AND MORE THAT CELL. AND AND I THINK WHAT. WE HEAR AN EIGHT AND WHAT I HEAR FROM MY COLLEAGUES IS THAT NOW THEY'RE GETTING A LITTLE IMPATIENT. ABOUT THIS SO -- SO WITH IT. SO IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS AND UNITE I GOT WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THAT SET HER UP BUT HOW MANY YEARS DO WE HAVE TO WAIT. RIGHT AND SO WHEN WHEN YOU KNOW HOW. THIS WORKS [inaudible] THE THANK YOU TO REGIONAL CENTER SHOULD BE IN OVERDRIVE TRYING TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. RIGHT I MEAN IT'S IT'S NOT NOT LIKE WHAT HAVE I GOT SOME LABEL DEAL TILE ON THE SIDE IF THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING INTERNALLY AND RIGHT NW CHANGING THE WAY THEY DO THINGS LOOKING AT HEY WHAT'S GOING ON AND WE HAVE TO TAKE THREE TYPES OF PEOPLE AT THE TABLE. TO BE SURE WE CAN ADDRESS THE DISPARITIES AT CENTER OF SO BEYOND JUST THE FUNDED PILOTS. YOU KNOW. WHO HE IS WE SHOULD BE SEEING -- YOU KNOW MAJOR CHANGES AND AND THE DISPARITY NUMBERS THAT'S THAT'S THE EXPECTATION. AND RIGHT AS FAR AS THOSE MEASURES YOU KNOW THE FIGHT. MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THOSE MEASURES AND BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THOSE MEASURES THE CERTAINLY IMPORTANT WE DO ABSOLUTELY AND AND THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF HAVING -- THE ESTABLISHED MEASURE MEASURES THAT WE PUT FORWARD -- I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT AS A DEPARTMENT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT ANY OF THE MAJOR INITIATIVES THE FIRST THINGS THAT WE DO IS TO SAY HOW ARE WE ADDRESSING THIS FROM. KIND OF A CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE AS WELL. SO WHAT WERE SO WE CAN REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT MAKING SURE THAT AS WERE IMPLEMENTING -- NEW EFFORTS THAT WERE NOT CONTINUING TO HAVE KIND OF THIS INEQUITY SO FOR EXAMPLE WITH SELF DETERMINATION. YOU KNOW WHEN WE WERE DOING OUR SELECTION AS FAR AS THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED PARTICIPANTS. THE FIRST POINT OF OF THE POLL AS FAR AS THE RANDOM SELECTION OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAD TO BE BASED ON ETHNICITY AS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE KIND OF THE COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE NOT PERPETUATING KIND OF THIS PROBLEM FROM NEW INITIATIVES. SO I JUST I JUST WANTED YOU NOTE. LIKE NOT MINIMIZE KIND OF THE THE CONCERNS THAT ARE SHARED BUT TO SAY THAT THIS EFFORT THAT HAS TO GO FORWARD IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE. ARE DOING MORE COMMITTED TO TO WORKING ON KIND OF THAT SIGNIFICANT ISSUE. WITHIN THE PROPOSAL'S BUT TAKING A LOOK AT THE CULTURE AND AGAIN HAVING THAT COMMITMENT AS WERE PUTTING FORWARD ANY OF THE NATION DOES THAT WERE DOING IT IN A MINDFUL WAY. SO WE'RE ADDRESSING IT -- THROUGH THE LENS OF MAKING SURE THAT AS OUR SYSTEM IS MAKING CHANGES THAT WERE ALSO DOING IT WITH RECOGNITION OF ADDRESSING THAT THE CULTURAL. AND AS WELL AS THE ETHNIC DIFFERENCES THAT OUR COMMUNITY IS [inaudible] SO. WELL I THINK THE EXPERT YEAH. SO I DON'T KNOW -- THIS WHISTLING CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHAT THEY'RE ABOUT HOW THE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE GOING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ALL A I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S ALL I MEAN WHEN. THEY AGENCIES ARE OVERSEEING IT BUT I MEAN I THINK THAT'S YES PEOPLE WANT PEOPLE PEOPLE AND PEOPLE I DON'T SWIM PILOTS THEY WANT TO SEE THE NUMBERS CHANGE. ABSOLUTELY AND SO I MEAN I REALIZE PILOTS HELP INFORM ACTIONS BUT AT SOME POINT YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT TO MOVE THE SCALE AND AND AND AND CHANGE THINGS AND SO AND IT'S NOT GONNA BE ANY SINGLE PILOT THERE'S NO SILVER BULLET TO THIS SO. I MEAN HAVE REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE BEEN I MEAN WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR SEVERAL YEARS HAVE BEEN HAVING YOU KNOW DEEP DISCUSSIONS STRATEGIC PLANS TO ADDRESS THIS BEYOND JUST DOING PILOTS BASED ON NOW. PUT OUT BY THE THE PARK THE BY THE DEPARTMENT ITSELF. ABSOLUTELY SO. REGIONAL CENTERS VIEW THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE DISPARITY GRANTS AS THAT OPPORTUNITY TO TRY BEYOND THE GRANTS A GOOD HEAD STRAIGHT SO UNDERSTAND CHANGING THE CULTURE INTERNALLY. AND THEY ARE DOING A LOT OF OTHER INITIATIVES THAT ARE TIED TO THE DISPARITY GRANTS THEY ARE PULLING TOGETHER FAMILIES TO TALK ABOUT WHAT SERVICES DO YOU NEED HOW DOES THIS WORK WHAT DOESN'T WORK WHAT DOES. ENERGY REACHING OUT TO NOT JUST CLIENTS OF COLOR BUT MAYBE OTHER FAMILIES OF DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUPS TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE THE PROD THE CHALLENGES THERE WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT S WAS PRESENTED WAS IS THAT. THEY'RE NOT GETTING ANY THEY'RE NOT THE EITHER THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE SERVICE IS NOT SEEKING THE SERVICES BECAUSE THEY FEEL IT'S NOT. DON'T DATE BALL THEY THEY'RE NOT FEELING IT REALLY CONNECTS WITH THEM SO YOU CAN'T JUST TALK TO THE PEOPLE YOU'RE SERVING YOU ACTION TO TALK TO PEOPLE YOU'RE NOT SERVING WHO. SHOULD BE SERVING. THAT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON ABSOLUTELY AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES IN A SYSTEM FINDING THOSE PEOPLE YOU'RE NOT SERVING AND ONE OF THE THINGS THE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE DOING -- IN PART THROUGH THE CULTURAL SPECIALIST BUT IN PART THROUGH JUST MORE TARGETED OUTREACH IN THOSE AREAS IS WORKING WITH COMMUNITY LEADERS. TO IDENTIFY. WHAT IS IT ABOUT OUR SERVICE SYSTEM THAT ISN'T SPEAKING TO PEOPLE? ARE WE GETTING PEOPLE TO COME IN THE FRONT DOOR AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK DONE ON THAT QUESTION. AND ONCE WE GET PEOPLE TO COME IN THE FRONT DOOR. IT'S NOT ABOUT CONVINCING PEOPLE THAT. WHAT? THE SERVICE DELIVERY THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN OFFERED IS APPROPRIATE FOR THEM AND THEY SHOULD TAKE IT IT'S ABOUT TAILORING SERVICES TO MEET THOSE NEEDS. AND A LOT OF WORK IN THAT RESPECT IS HAPPENING AS WELL -- IN TERMS OF IDENTIFYING SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM -- DIFFERENT DIVERSE COMMUNITIES AS WELL -- FINDING PEOPLE WHO HAVE ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE CAPABILITIES WHO CAN -- INTERFACE WITH DIFFERENT POPULATIONS -- AS DIRECTOR BRIDGEMAN SAID A LOT OF WORK IS GOING ON WITH -- A PROMONTORY MODELS BUT ALSO SIMILAR MODELS WHERE YOU ARE WORKING WITH. CURRENT MENTORS WHO -- PARENTS WHO HAVE CHILDREN IN THE SYSTEM TO OUTREACH TO OTHER PARENTS THEY KNOW AND OTHER PARENTS THAT THEY COME TO KNOW WHO ALSO HAVE CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES. IT IS A COMPLEX SYSTEM AND FINDING WAYS TO BREAK IT DOWN AND HELP PEOPLE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND IS A HUGE PIECE OF IT -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE DONE A LOT OF OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BEST EXPLAINER SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN A WAY. THAT -- IS ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE AND THEN ASK PEOPLE THROUGH INCREASINGLY ROBUST PERSON CENTERED PLANNING. HELP US TO IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THE GOALS FOR YOU AND YOUR LOVED. ONE AND HOW CAN WE AS A TEAM WORK TO GET THERE EVEN IF IT'S NOT WITH THEIR CURRENT SERVICES OKAY SO AND I KNOW RESERVE TRYING TO MOVE INSTRUCTIONAL THE PC AND SO FORTH BUT I THINK. THAT. BUT I THINK THAT THE PROBLEM IS LIKE IS ARE WE TRYING TO MAKE THEIR FAMILIES CONFORM TO OUR SYSTEM. OR SHOULD BE SYSTEM BE SERVING OUR FAMILIES AND WHAT WE'RE HEARING IS THAT WE HAVE -- DISPARITY ISSUE PARTIALLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE FAMILIES -- WHO -- PARTICULARLY FAMILIES WHO -- AND DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUPS OR CATEGORIES OF COLOR WHO DO NOT -- UNDERSTAND OR DO NOT -- IT FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH -- THE CURRENT SYSTEM AND SO WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO RESPOND TO THAT AND I A AGAIN I WOULD. UNDERSCORE THE URGENCY OF THAT NIGHT THREE YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE SAID THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM. HERE'S SOME MORE MONEY TO DEAL WITH THAT IT CETERA -- AND YOU KNOW AND I GET ASKED ABOUT IT AND AND THAT'S LIKE WHEN WHEN CAN I TELL THEM THAT WE'VE CHANGED THE NEEDLE HAS MOVED TO WRITE SO -- AND YEAH I WANNA BE JAIL THREE YEARS LATER SAYING OH WELL WE'RE STILL DOING PILOTS AND STUFF IT'S IT'S ULTIMATELY I MEAN YES IT MATTERS WHAT YOU DO BUT ULTIMATELY THE AND THE QUESTION IS IS THAT. ARE PEOPLE GETTING SORRY ON THE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE A SERVICE THEY NEEDED A WE DOING THIS I I COULD REALLY. ACROSS DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES AND OF THE ANSWER STILL NO. THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM THAT ARE YOU KNOW TO YOUR TO YOUR POINT IF YOU WANT ONE THING AND FERNANDO ADDRESS THIS IN. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT TO DEPARTMENT CAN DO STATEWIDE IS TO REALLY. IMPLEMENT -- AND WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS -- AWAY SO THAT PEOPLE DO NOT FEEL INTIMIDATED OR FEEL LIKE THEY'RE GONNA BE RETALIATED THAT SURREAL FEELING EVEN IF IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAPPEN. AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IS NOT GOOD PEOPLE WORKING AT THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND BECAUSE THERE ARE. AND I THINK WE HAVE TO DO IS CREATE A SITUATION WHERE IT IS SAFE FOR PEOPLE TO RAISE CONCERNS THAT YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE SERVICES OR THERE'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T CREATE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. THAN ALL THE REPORTING THE WORLD IS NOT GOING TO MATTER RIGHT AND YOU KNOW JUST FROM YOUR OWN PRACTICE. AND WE GOT TO CREATE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR PEOPLE TO AT LEAST RAISE CONCERNS. AND THAT AGAIN IS NOT A REFLECTION ON THE GOOD PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND REGIONAL CENTERS BUT IT'S ALSO NOT A REFLECTION. OF THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITIES WHO SIMPLY WANT TO GET HELP FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND I THINK IF WE WORK IN THAT WAY WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER -- AND THEN LATER ON THE OTHER STEPS AS YOU MENTIONED SENATOR -- YOU KNOW MIGHT START WORKING BUT THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN STATEWIDE I I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT OR SOME STEP TO HAVE TO HAPPEN STATEWIDE. CAN HAPPEN AS A PILOT BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE'RE NEVER GONNA SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IN READ THE FEAR RETALIATION IS DEFINITELY REAL EVEN IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AND I AND I WOULD. EVEN THOUGH THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT ANALOGY BUT TO ME TOO MOVEMENT REALLY CREATED FIRST THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE IT WAS SAFE FOR PEOPLE WOMEN. ESPECIALLY TO FEEL THEY CAN RAISE A COMPLAINT OR CONCERNED ABOUT BEING HARASSED THAT WAS A MAJOR STEP. AND FOR THE FOR THEM TO FEEL THAT SAFE PLACE AND WE GOT TO CREATE SOMETHING LIKE THAT LEASE FOR THOSE FAMILIES WHO FEEL THREATENED EVEN AFTER YOU KNOW THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAPPEN. AGAIN IT'S NOT A REFLECTION ON THE GOOD PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. BUT THE OTHER THING THAT IS IS THAT THE IF YOU'RE A CONCERN THAT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU YOU TURN THERE'S BEEN OTHER PASS SO MAYBE IT'S STRICTLY TO THE APARTMENTS WHERE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY CAN EXPRESS BECAUSE OTHERWISE. YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE IS THAT THE PERSON THE PERSON YOU HAVE TO TALK TO ABOUT THIS IS THE RIGHT PERSON YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. THAT'S A PROBLEM. TOO THE OTHER THING I WOULD MAKE NOTE -- SINCE THIS IS A BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND WE DON'T JUST DO THIS THE APARTMENT -- YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING -- MY MIND APPROPRIATELY THAT WE DO DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING ON EVERY CHILD IN MEDI CAL [inaudible] GREAT [inaudible] GOOD THING. WELL WHAT HAPPENS WE START PICKING UP ALL THOSE KIDS DO YOU THINK YOU KNOW YOU THINK ABOUT THE PERCENTAGE SO IT WAS ON A REFERENCE TO THE THE AUDIT REPORT THAT SHOWED UP MOST TO THE OUT BY KIDS ARE GETTING. THERE PREVENTIVE CARE AND THAT INCLUDES THE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING. OKAY NOW WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING THAT AND HOPEFULLY WILL FIX THAT RIGHT AND THEN ALL HAPPEN IS WE'RE GONNA TRY TO SCREEN ALL THOSE WE HAVE A NEW SURGEON GENERAL FOR A TUESDAY INTEREST IS AND ADVERSE TO OUT EVENTS -- THINK ABOUT WHICH AGENCIES ARE NOW GOING TO BE GETTING ALL OF THOSE REFERRALS. SENATOR IF -- YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THEM THAT'S GOING TO GET A LOT OF REFERRALS AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AND FROM THE LAW AND ACTUALLY THE THE THE THEY'LL POINT OUT THAT WE HAVETO SAY YES WE HAVE DISPARITIES IN OTHER PLACES AND THAT INCLUDES -- SO WHEN WE TRY TO FIX THAT PROBLEM IN THE MEDIC OUTSIDE AND SO FORTH. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A WAVE OF PEOPLE COMING OVER THIS WAY AND THEY FEEL LIKE THAT AND THEN IF THEY DON'T GET SERVICE HERE AND SO WE CAN GET YEAH THAT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM SO YEAH. SENATE IF I CAN REALLY BRIEFLY MENTIONED ARM I PERSONALLY AM VERY ENCOURAGED WITH THE INTRO TO DEPARTMENT HAS MADE AND A LOT OF THAT PLANTS THAT THEY'VE LOOKING TO PUT IN PLACE AND AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THERE IS NO ONE SILVER BULLET THAT'S GONNA. REALLY RESOLVE A LOT OF THESE CHALLENGES BUT I THINK ONE OF THE KEY ITEMS THAT I BELIEVE WE CAN WORK COLLABORATIVE TOGETHER. IS WILL WE CAN HAVE A A A A SPACE OR PLACER A SAFE HAVEN WHERE PEOPLE CAN FEEL LIKE THEY CAN REALLY OPEN UP AND HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. IT BE EDUCATIONAL ALL THE WAY AROUND SO IF WE CAN FOCUS ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT WERE CONVERSATIONS MINIMAL CONVERSATIONS WITHOUT THAT FEAR RETALIATION WILL HAPPEN I BELIEVE A LOT OF GROUND COULD BE COVERED QUICKLY. OKAY WELL CAN WE CREATE THAT SPACE DIRECTOR. YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE REALLY AS I MENTIONED WHEN WE FIRST STARTED THE CONVERSATION ONE OF THE THE THINGS THAT I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR IS -- THIS GROUP OF MOMS THAT HAVE BEEN MEETING WITH ME. AND I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT THAT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A SAFE CONVERSATION -- AND SO I A I LOOK FORWARD TO LOOKING T WHAT ARE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AND HOW DO WE KIND OF BROAD NOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE SAFE CONVERSATION SO. FOLKS FEEL COMFORTABLE SHARING THE CONCERNED SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE NOTE THAT THERE'S THERE'S ALWAYS THOSE THOSE PEARLS THAT CAN BE BROADENED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THOSE THOSE SAFE CONVERSATIONS THAT I AM I AM. I AM ALWAYS COMMITTED TO MAKING. A COMMITMENT TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN DO THAT. OKAY SO -- SO WE HAVE AN URGENT PROBLEM. WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT. THE NEED TO MOVE ON THIS RIGHT WE HAVE SO WE NEED TO TRY TO WE NEED -- TO THE NEED ON THE DISPARITIES -- PART OF DOING THAT IS NOT ONLY THE VARIOUS PILOTS AND SO FORTH BUT TREATING THAT SPACES FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE HONEST CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS -- STARRING SO THAT SOUND THAT'S AN ISSUE AND AND BY THE WAY YOU -- THERE'S A POTENTIAL WAVE OF MORE KIDS THAT'S GOING TO SHOW UP. IF WE ACTUALLY EXECUTE ON SOME OTHER POLICIES THAT THE GOVERNOR'S EXPRESSES. HIS GOAL IN THE AND IS AND I SHARE THOSE -- BUT I ALSO WAS VERY CONSCIOUS IS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT THAT. THIS AGENCIES AND ALL AND THE THE VARIOUS THE BILL. THERE IS GOING TO BE THE THE ONE OF THE RECIPIENTS OF THE THAT ACTIVITY. WELL IT'S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO DETECT IT SOMEONE NEEDS TO THEN PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES AND SO THIS IS ONE OF THE AGENCIES AND THE CENTER REGIONAL CENTER THAT THAT OUR CONTRACT WITH IT CETERA. IT IS GOING TO HAVE YOU WITH AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE FROM LOTS OF DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES OF WE DO THIS RIGHT. AND THEN -- SO IF WE DO IT RIGHT WILL BE SURE TO SCREEN SO THAT'S A DISPARITIES ISSUE IF THE DRESS THERE -- WE FIX THAT PROBLEM BUT THEN IT MEANS THAT WHEN THEY SHOW UP AT THIS AGE AND SELL AT THE BILL BUT THE PROGRAMS OVERSEEN BY THIS AGENCY THEY NEED TO BE SURE TO GET SERVED. AS WELL AND THERE'S A CELL ASIDE FROM THE FINANCIAL ISSUES WE ALSO NEED TO SHARE WITH ELIMINATE CULTURAL BARRIERS AND THAT'S ALSO PART OF THE URGENCY NOT ONLY FOR THE EXISTING CLIENTS AND EXPECTED FUTURE. BUT THOSE ARE THE CLIENTS AS WELL SO. CAN HELP YOU UNDERSTAND EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS WHY I AM SO ANXIOUS THAT WE MOVE THE NEEDLE ON THIS BILL. THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE -- WELL WE ARE WE'RE DOING SOME STUFF BUT I MEAN THAT'S GREAT PEOPLE DOING STUFF THEY ALSO WAS THE RESULTS [inaudible] ALL RIGHT [inaudible] OKAY. SO I KNOW WE SPENT A BIT OF TIME ON THIS BY. I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM PEOPLE HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS. ALL RIGHT THANKS VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE PANELISTS. OKAY ISSUE NUMBER TEN SPRING LETTER B. C. P. FOSTER USED COMMON FORMS SYSTEMS OF CARE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU -- ON ISSUE -- TEN THE AGENDA DOES PROVIDE REALLY GOOD DESCRIPTION AS FAR AS AB TWENTY EIGHTY THREE AND THEN PORTENT FOCUS. ON THE CORE NEED AN TIMELY TRAUMA INFORMED SYSTEM OF CARE APPROACH. AND THE EFFORT THAT -- WILL BE MOVING FORWARD SO WITH THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND THE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTIONS REQUIRED TO BRING TOGETHER A JOINT EIGHT INTER AGENCY RESOLUTION TEAM. AND OUR PROPOSAL IS REALLY CENTERED AROUND KIND OF THE RESPONSE TO LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN -- BE ABLE TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE WE ARE CURRENTLY ACTIVELY A PARTICIPANT IN THE EFFORTS -- THAT ARE IN DESIGNING THE THAT THE INTER AGENCY RESOLUTION TEAM -- WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO FROM A STATE PERSPECTIVE BE ABLE TO SUPPORT AND INFORM THE AMMO USE THAT WOULD BE OCCURRING AT THE KIND OF COUNTY LEVELS -- AND REALLY IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE EXT ESPECIALLY THOSE FOSTER CARE CHILDREN THAT HAVE KIND OF SHARING OF SYSTEMS. AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH AND SUPPORTING THE INDIVIDUALS -- WE CURRENTLY HAVE WITHIN DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES OVER FIVE THOUSAND KIDS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED A DISABILITY THAT ARE -- ALSO -- HAVE A COURT DEPENDENCY -- WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THE MO USE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WOULD THEN MOVE FORWARD SO WHILE THE -- AB. TWENTY EIGHTY THREE OUTLINES KINDA GOING THE COUNTY BASED REGIONAL CENTERS ARE NOT ESTABLISHED AS A COUNTY THERE'S TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS. SO WHEN WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE. MOVING FORWARD THE INTENT OF MAKING SURE THERE'S A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT WHEN WE LOOKED AT HOW WE CAN BEST SUPPORT THAT THAT'S WHAT THIS PROPOSALS ABOUT. IS HAVING THE STAFF THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THOSE EFFORTS SO WHEN WE LOOK AT DOING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT LA COUNTY HAVING FIVE STAFF THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO WORK WITHIN. THE LA COUNTY REGIONAL CENTERS WE HAVE SEVEN REGIONAL CENTERS IN THAT AREA AND THEN WE WILL LOOK AT THE REST OF THE STATE WE DID A AND APPOINT FIBER A PART TIME. POSITION THAT WOULD BE IN THE SMALLER AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE AS MANY CHILDREN THAT ARE ACTUALLY -- COURT DEPENDENCE OR THAT WOULD HAVE KIND OF THOSE MULTIPLE SYSTEMS ON THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO WORK WITH SO THAT'S OUR PROPOSALS TO MAKE SURE THATWE HAVE THE RESOURCES -- PARTICULARLY AT THE REGIONAL CENTER LEVEL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THAT COORDINATED -- SUPPORT AND DISCUSSION ON ON THE CHILDREN THAT HAVE TO SHARE SYSTEMS. OKAY THANK YOU COMES FROM OHIO. FINANCE [inaudible] OKAY. SO THAT EVERY SHIFT -- A SO ACTUALLY AB I'M NOT SURE MAYBE I'M THIRTY MYSTIC ANSWERED BY SO IN TERMS OF MULTIPLE REGIONAL CENTERS -- BUT BASICALLY HAVE AB DID YOU MENTION RIGHTS YOU HAVE SOME PLACES YOU HAVE MULTIPLE REGIONAL CENTERS WITH -- MULL IT IN ONE COUNTY OTHER PLACES YOU HAVE ONE RESULTS ARE COVERING MULTIPLE COUNTIES HOUSE. IN TERMS OF COORDINATING BETWEEN IS THAT THE THE HOUSE APARTMENTS GOING TO BE TRYING TO BE SURE WE DON'T HAVE REGIONAL CENTERS RUNNING INTO EACH OTHER AND THE AND THE USE. CORRECT YEAH AND AND JUST WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT LA COUNTY RIGHT WITH THE SEVEN REGIONAL CENTERS THEY'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER IN FOR MANY MANY MANY YEARS YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY PLAN. WORKING IN THE SAME COUNTY SO THEY'VE HAD -- TO AS A AS A REGIONAL CENTERS OF SEVEN REGIONAL CENTERS THEY'VE HAD TO LEARN TO KIND OF HOW DO THEY COORDINATE. AMONGST THEMSELVES SO THEN THEY'RE WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE COUNTY SO THEY THEY HAVE THOSE KIND OF OKAY SO LA LAYS THE WORKS ALREADY BUILT ISRAELIS USED TO WORKING EACH OTHER THERE'S ARE YOU DO YOU HAVE OTHER AREAS WHERE YOU SEE THE SCREEN OF THE TENT. MORE FOR POTENTIAL PROBLEMS. YOU KNOW THE REGIONAL CENTERS THAT HAVE KIND OF SHARED COUNTIES IT'S VERY LIMITED OTHER THAN YOU KNOW REALLY LA COUNTY'S LARGEST -- ONE SO I'D I DON'T SEE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THAT IN THE END -- SO AMONGST THOSE AREAS I THINK HAVING THE STAFF OUT THERE THAT'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS THAT COORDINATED EFFORT IS GOING TO HELP. OKAY THAT'S ALL RIGHT THANK YOU RIGHT ISSUE NUMBER ELEVEN CRISIS HOMES FOR CHILDREN. TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. YES SO FOR THE COMMUNITY AT THE COMMUNITY CRISIS HOMES FOR CHILDREN -- I HAS I SPOKE ABOUT THOSE A LITTLE BIT EARLIER WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SAFETY NET YEP SO THE PROPOSAL WAS. TO HAVE THE THREE COMMUNITY CRISIS HOMES FOR CHILDREN BUT REALLY IT'S ABOUT HAVING THAT -- THE ABILITY TO HAVE THIS LICENSE CATEGORY IT'S A BRAND NEW LICENSE CATEGORY FOR CHILDREN THIS IS REPLICATED AFTER A COMMUNITY CHORUSES HOMES FOR ADULTS. I'M SO RECOGNIZING THAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS HAS STARTED TO DEVELOP THOSE RESOURCES WE HAVE A NUMBER OF THEM THAT HAVE NOW BEEN. LICENSED AND THEY'RE IN OPERATION WE HAVE QUITE A FEW MORE RIGHT NOW THAT ARE IN DEVELOPMENT BUT ALSO UNDERSTANDING THE URGENCY OF OF SUPPORTING CHILDREN. IN NEEDING KIND OF THAT STABILIZATION SO WE TOOK A LOOK AT KIND OF THE NUMBER OF KIDS AS I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. THAT WE WE WANTED TO GET A JUMP START ON IT WE DIDN'T WANT TO GET THE AUTHORITY TO GO AHEAD AND DEVELOP THE HOMES AND THEN HAVE THE REGIONAL CENTERS. START DEVELOPING KIND OF THE THE PLANS WE WANT TO GO AHEAD AND SAY LET'S START WITH AT LEAST THREE LET'S GO AHEAD AND GET THE AUTHORITY TO DO THE LICENSING. ARM AND THEN WE CAN FOLLOW IT UP WITH FUTURE YEARS WHEN WE START DOING THAT BIGGER PLAN OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S NEEDED. THANK YOU LA -- COMMENTS FINANCE ALRIGHT SO. ALRIGHT SO WE GIVE YOU THE STORY RIGHT -- ISSUE NUMBER TWELVE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE OF SPECIALIZED CASELOAD RATIOS FOR REGIONAL CENTERS. YES THANK YOU AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WITH THE SAFETY NET WHEN WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT ELEMENTS THAT HAVE TO KIND OF MOVE FORWARD YOU KNOW WHEN WE DO TAKE A LOOK AT KIND OF THIS THE THE RANGE OF WHERE THE SUPPORTS NEED TO OCCUR. YOU KNOW I I REALLY WANT US TO START LOOKING AT KIND OF THAT PREVENTATIVE SUPPORTIVE AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE FRONT END OF A CRISIS OR STABILIZING AS SOMEBODY HAS BEEN IN CRISIS HOW DO WE HELP THE FAMILY AND THE INDIVIDUAL. KIND OF STABILIZE THE REGIONAL CENTERS CASELOAD. AS FAR AS BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS WITH COMPLEX NEEDS WE'VE NOT ADDRESS THAT IN THE PAST THIS PROPOSAL REALLY GETS TO ADDRESSING THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. GIVING THE REGIONAL CENTERS ABILITY TO HAVE A CASELOAD A SPECIALIZED CASE ON A ONE TO TWENTY FIVE THAT IS REALLY FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN HELP STABILIZE. THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE AND KIND OF THE MOST -- COULD A CRISIS IF YOU WILL -- AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT BY HAVING A SERVICE COORDINATOR THAT'S ABLE TO YOU KNOW WORK WITH THE FAMILY WORK WITH THE INDIVIDUAL WORK WITH THE OTHER AGENCIES THAT CAN PROVIDE THOSE SUPPORT SERVICES WORK WITH THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PROVIDING IT THROUGH -- THE VENDOR SERVICES THAT WE WILL SEE YOU CAN IT INCREASE STABILIZATION ON MORE OF A PREVENTATIVE AS OPPOSED TO KIND OF APPROACHING REACTIVE BIKE KIND OF THE CLOSE COMMUNITY CRISIS HOMES ETCETERA SO IT'S APPROACH. TO KIND OF DO THE FRONT END AND THE SUPPORTIVE SIDE -- IN IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE SERVICE SIDE AS WELL. BELIAU COMMENTS THIRTY PEDICLE ALE A REAL BRIEFLY WE DON'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL WE THINK IT'S LIKELY A GOOD IDEA BUT IT DID. BRING UP AN ISSUE FOR US THAT WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT FOR SEVERAL YEARS WHICH IS THE FACT THAT MOST REGIONAL CENTERS ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE THE REQUIRED STAFFING RATIOS ACROSS VARIOUS CATEGORIES SO. I MEAN THIS MAY HELP. EASE SOME OF THOSE -- SOME OF THOSE RATIOS OF A BIT BUT IT YOU KNOW AGAIN IT'S ONLY ABOUT FIFTY ADDITIONAL SERVICE COORDINATORS AND WE ONLY MENTION THIS TO TO POINT OUT THAT. EVEN FOR THOSE CONSUMERS WHO ARE NOT IN CRISIS THEY ALSO NEED AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF TIME WITH THEIR SERVICE COORDINATOR TO GET WHAT THEY NEED AND WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN PURCHASE OF SERVICE EXPENDITURES. YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT -- STAFFING RATIOS THAT ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE PROBABLY DON'T HELP. RIGHT. IN FACT IT PROBABLY DOES RATIOS ARE PROBABLY DESIGNED. FOR CLIENTS WHO DON'T HAVE LANGUAGE CHALLENGES OR CULTURAL CHALLENGES AS WELL. ALL RIGHT FINANCE [inaudible] OKAY SO [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. SO JUST HOW OUT OF COMPLIANCE OR THE OTHER ISSUES. SO -- THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE REQUESTED A DATE ON THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND HAVE NOT ACTUALLY RECEIVED IT -- I UNDERSTAND IN THE NEXT ISSUE IN THE NEXT -- ISSUE IN THE AGENDA THAT -- THEY ASSOCIATION REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES WILL BE TALKING ABOUT. THAT VERY ISSUE AND I THINK THEY HAVE ACCESS TO BETTER DATA THAN WE DO OKAY SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN NOW YES. WE DO HAVE -- UPDATED. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS WE HAVE -- CASELOAD RATIOS THAT IS REPORTED TO US WERE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT AND IT IT IS. THE LAST TIME IT WAS UPDATED WAS. MARCH FIRST SO WE'LL WE'LL GO AHEAD AND PROVIDE THE CASELOAD RATIO REPORT THAT WE DO RECEIVE. OKAY THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC BECAUSE THAT'S THE EXACT REPORT THAT OUR OFFICE HAS REQUESTED PASSED O YOU KNOW I SO ALL RIGHT I APPRECIATED DIRECTOR NAY YOU'LL SUPPLY THAT TO THE LA L. THANK YOU [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. OKAY RIGHT THE CELL ISSUE NUMBER THIRTEEN IS ACTUALLY A PROPOSALS FOR INVESTMENTS OF USEFULNESS. STAY THERE AND WILL. HAVE. THE ASSOCIATION FOR REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES COME UP AND THANK YOU HAVE [inaudible] THREE THREE ITEMS. A THREE REQUESTS. AND THE I THINK WE DO HAVE A DESCRIPTION OF THOSE SO BREVITY WOULD BE APPRECIATED. ABSOLUTELY AND I APPRECIATE THE KICKING OFF OF THE DISCUSSION OF SERVICE COORDINATION. JUST BRIEFLY SERVICE COORDINATION IS THE CORE FUNCTION OF REGIONAL CENTERS AND THE MOST VISIBLE FUNCTION THEY PROVIDE. IT GOES FAR BEYOND BEING AN ELIGIBILITY WORKER FOR RESPITE OR OTHER SERVICES AND IS FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT MAKING THE LIVES OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES BETTER AND EASIER. IT'S ABOUT BEING A SUPPORT FOR THEM IN THE GOOD TIMES AND BAD. IN SERVICE COORDINATORS I'VE WORKED WITH. THEY'VE HAD. TO BE THAT PERSON THAT A FAMILY. DOES TO WHEN THEY DISCOVER THAT THEIR CHILD HAS A DISABILITY AND NEED SOMEONE TO PROCESS THAT WITH. WE CELEBRATE THE SUCCESSES OF A CHILD COMMUNICATING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A WAY THAT THE FAMILY UNDERSTANDS EVEN IF THAT COMMUNICATION ISN'T VERBAL. THEY SUPPORT FAMILIES WHEN SOMETHING UNEXPECTEDLY PUNCHES HIM IN THE GUT. LIKE WHEN YOUR CHILD TURNS SIXTEEN AND THEY'RE NOT DRIVING YOU DIDN'T EXPECT HIM TO BUT THAT SIXTEENTH BIRTHDAY STILL HURTS. AND THEY ATTEND FUNERAL SERVICES ALONGSIDE FAMILY MEMBERS SOMETIMES EVEN THOUGH CEREMONIES USUALLY RESERVED ONLY FOR FAMILY MEMBERS. AND TO BE SUCCESSFUL SERVICE COORDINATORS NEED A WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE BEHIND THEM TO MAKE THEM EFFECTIVE. WE NEED CLINICAL SERVICES SUPPORT SERVICES. THEY NEED RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT QUALITY ASSURANCE RISK MITIGATION ACCOUNTING SOMEONE HAS TO PAY SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR THE SERVICES THAT ARE COORDINATED. EFFECTIVE SERVICE COORDINATION AND OTHER CRITICAL SUPPORT SERVICES. AT REASONABLE CASELOAD RATIOS IS WHAT WE ARE PROMISED TO PROVIDE WE PROMISE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN OUR INSURANCES. AND THIS IS A PROMISE THE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP. WE HAVE A COMPLEX ARRAY OF CASELOAD RATIOS. BUT IN NO CASE. HAVE WE PROMISED ANYTHING GREATER THAN A ONE TO SIXTY SIX CASELOAD RATIO. TODAY MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS OF THE PEOPLE SUPPORTED BY REGIONAL CENTERS ARE IN CASE LOADS OF GREATER THAN SEVENTY PEOPLE SO OVER THREE QUARTERS OF THE PEOPLE. ARE BEING SHORT CHANGED THEIR SERVICE COORDINATION TIME. AS CASELOADS GET LARGER. AND DOCUMENTATION EXPECTED GREAT EXPECTATIONS GET MORE ONEROUS. WHAT WE FIND IS THAT SERVICE COORDINATORS? CHECK BOXES. BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT CAN BE AUDITED AND COUNTED. AND WHAT WE LOSE IN THAT PROCESS WHEN A CASELOAD RATIO IS TOO HIGH. IS THE QUALITY OF THE INTERACTION INTERACTIONS BECOME MORE TRANSACTIONAL. AND THE TIME FOR CULTIVATING STRONG TRUSTING RELATIONSHIPS IS WHAT GETS SACRIFICED. TODAY THE STATE IS SIX HUNDRED NINETY ONE SERVICE COORDINATOR SHORT. FROM WHAT WE WERE PROMISED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WHAT WE KNOW MAKES REGIONAL CENTER SPECIAL AND SETS THEM APART FROM ELIGIBILITY WORKERS. REGIONAL CENTERS PRIORITIZE SERVICE COORDINATION. BUT THIS REQUIRES THAT THEY SACRIFICE OTHER THINGS BECAUSE BUDGETED SERVICE COORDINATION WAGES AND BENEFITS ARE ABOUT 57% OF THE ACTUAL COST OF AN F. DESK YOU TO WRAP UP JEFF AND I ASSUME YOU WANT ACTUALLY GET TO YOUR REQUEST. OUR REQUESTS ARE PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD AND THEY'RE ALL TIED TO THIS. SINCE THE LAST TIME. REGIONAL CENTERS RECEIVED AN INFLUX OF MONEY FOR OPERATIONS. THE CPI HAS INCREASED BY 8% THE CALIFORNIA WAGE INDEX BY TWELVE SO THERE'S A REQUEST FOR AN 8%. DOWN PAYMENT FOR RETENTION AND COMPETITIVE WAGES. IT WOULD COST AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY EIGHT POINT TWO MILLION GENERAL FUND. TO BACK FILL THE SIX HUNDRED NINETY ONE MISSING POSITIONS AND APPROPRIATE SUPERVISION. AND IF WE WERE TO TRY TO BRING. REGIONAL CENTERS BUDGETED. SALARIES FOR SERVICE COORDINATION UP TO CURRENT STANDARDS IT WOULD BE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ANNUALLY WHICH IS A BIG INVESTMENT. BUT IT'S BECAUSE THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN STAR FOR SO LONG SO. THAT'S IT OKAY. YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS FROM THE FOR PART OF THE HEALTH SERVICES. NO OKAY -- COMMENTS AT THE LA -- FINANCE [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] SO -- I APPRECIATE THE HE SAID ABOUT THE SHORTFALL HERE SO WE HAVE THREE WE HAVE AN OPERATIONAL OF PAYMENT SERVICE CORPS NATION SHORTFALL REALIGNMENT SOME. OF PLANNING COSTS -- SO CLEARLY AND YOU SAID WERE SIX HUNDRED NINETY ONE SHORT. CORRECT [inaudible] YES OKAY -- DID TO EAT ITSELF SO CERTAINLY WE HAVE AN OVERALL AND NUMBER SHORTAGE STATE YOUR AND DESERVE AGREEMENT WITH THAT NUMBER [inaudible] MYERS. WE'VE NOT LOOKED AT THAT I LIKE IS THAT WE DO HAVE A CASELOAD RATIO REPORTS AND SO THERE -- AS MISS WAS LEAN HAD NOTED THAT THERE'S DIFFERENT RATIOS THAT A RETURN FOR RIGHT PURPOSES AND SO TO TAKE A LOOK AT KIND OF THAT OVERALL ANALYSIS YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S A LITTLE BIT. OF OF VIEW THAT WE NEED TO DO AS A RESULT -- BUT LIKE I SAID THERE'S RATIOS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO MOVE FROM DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS THERE'S RATIOS. FOR COMPLIANCE WITH OUR APPLICATION FOR THE WAIVER SO THERE'S THERE'S AN A NAME NUMBER OF PIECES BUT WE ARE SEEING THAT THERE'S A WITHIN OUR CASELOAD RATIOS. THE KIND OF AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT. ONE TO SEVENTY SEVENTY YEAH SO IT'S IT'S A REPORTED RIGHT NOW BETWEEN ONE TO SEVENTY SEVEN OR ONE SEVENTY FIVE ALL RIGHT. AND AS FAR AS THE THE THE RACIAL ETHNIC DISTRICT -- DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE BILL'S EXISTING AND FEATURES COORDINATORS THAT REFLECTIVE OF THE POPULATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE DON'T HAVE THAT DATA YOU KNOW I KNOW ANYONE COLLECTING THAT DATA. WE DON'T CUTTING THAT. WE DON'T LIKE IT THE DEPARTMENT WE DON'T COLLECT I DON'T AND WHAT ABOUT THE EMPLOYERS I MEAN YOU HAVE TO THE SPY EOC REPORTS AND SO FORTH FOR EMPLOYEES AND CETERA SO. AND IN TERMS OF STATEWIDE NUMBERS I DON'T HAVE IT I HAVE HEARD FROM A COUPLE OF REGIONAL CENTERS THAT HAVE COLLECTED THAT DATE AND THEY DO FIND THAT THEIR SERVICE COORDINATORS ARE LARGELY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEMOCRAT A. B. TO ADAPT THAT DATA. RIGHT AS WE WERE TALKING PREVIOUSLY. RIGHT CELL AND ALSO. AND THE LANGUAGE CAPACITY. THE SERVICE COORDINATORS. SO THE GOOD TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION TO WE DON'T HAVE IT OKAY. RIGHT BUT I THINK IT WOULD ALSO BE GOOD. TO CHECK UP ON I MEAN CLEARLY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH IF YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU'RE RATIOS ONE TO SEVENTY FIVE RIGHT OKAY. OKAY ANYTHING ELSE THE ON OKAY. ALL RIGHT OKAY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SO -- WE WILL. GO AHEAD TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT THEN ON ISSUES NINE THROUGH THIRTEEN AGAIN ASK IF YOU CAN PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO A MINUTE OR LESS. RIGHT THANK YOU WELCOME. THANK YOU -- MY NAME IS HOST OF IN ANY OF IS A AND I'M FROM THE INTEGRATED COMMUNITY COLLABORATIVE -- NE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANTED TO MENTION IS DAY MIS COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE FAMILY IT'S AN AND THEIR REGIONAL CENTER. NOW -- WORKING WITH FAMILIES IREALIZE THAT IT'S A BIG ISSUE BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT'S NOT TRANSLATED -- GOOD ENOUGH OR OR WERE THEY JUST. DON KNOW HOW TO COMMUNICATE SO I THINK YOU FROM. WE FIND A WAIT FOR THE REGIONAL CENTER TO TELL THE FAMILIES. IN ALL. ON ONE WAY. IT WILL BE WAY FOR MUCH BETTER FOR THE FAMILIES TO UNDERSTAND IT OR EITHER -- SO EVERYBODY COULD KNOW WHAT IT IS BECAUSE NOW I FIND OUT THAT A LOT OF A LOT OF OUR CASES ARE A LOT OF MISCOMMUNICATION. AND THEN THE FAMILY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE SERVICES -- THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THERE IS. OR OR THEY REGIONAL CENTER THE SERVICE COORDINATORS TELLS THEM THE NAME OF THE SERVICE BUT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT COVERS. SO I THINK A MUSE COMMUNICATION IS A BIG ISSUE WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER AND THE FAMILIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME -- HI EVERYBODY I WILL TRY IS PICKING THESE ARE I'M PER SE ONE IS A THANK YOU JUDY MYERS OF THE V. YOU'LL FOR HIM BY AS THE BUT DISOBEY AND IS MEETING. AIRING -- MY COMMENT IS THE STICKING -- I KNOW EVERYBODY WE ARE HERE DISCUSS THING ABOUT -- THESE ARE A BIT ISHAQ. M. FOR ME AS AS VERY SAD HERE SUNDAY ALLY THAT ODD Là YOU. MAY BE -- YOU THESE ARE NOT FIXED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE MAYBE WE CAN CHANGE SOMETHING FOR MEDICA. FOR ME IS VERY SAD BECAUSE I WOULD CONSUMERS NEED THAT REGULAR CENTER NEEDED SERVICES. IN ORDER SO IF EVERYBODY REMEMBER -- FOR WHAT A FOR WHAT THE REGULAR CENTERS. WHAT MADE WHAT WAS THE MAIN PURPOSE? FOR THE REGULAR CENTERS. YEAH ALLEVIATE IT -- IS A WONDERFUL WONDERFUL SERVICE SAYS IT WONDERFUL I CAN SEE BUT THE PROBLEM IS HOW IS IT WORKING THIS SEIZE THEM SYSTEMATIC ARE NOW IS THAT BE IT FOR ALL BILLING. SYSTEM AT THE BRAWLING NOW BANG. WE NEED TO MAKE CHANGE AND WORK TOGETHER THANK YOU SO MUCH EVERYBODY THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME. NUMBER SEVEN AND TO THIS. FIRST OF ALL I RECOGNIZE THE HARD WORK. THAT HAS BEEN DONE. A SO FAR. BY ALL DAY USES BUT UP THIS PETITIONS ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN THE ACTUAL RESULTS. TO THE POINT THAT I HE GIVES THE IMPRESSION THAT THERE IS NO SENSE OF URGENCY IN SOME AREAS. UP THE SAID THE THIS A CULTURAL ISSUE. OF THE TWO HISPANICS OR DIFFERENT CULTURES INVOLVED. WHICH I DEFINITELY DISAGREED BUT IS MORE THAN -- REGIONAL CENTERS CULTURE IN THE WAY OF THESE FAMILIES ARE ARE BEING. TAKEN CARE OF FOR WHEN THEY REQUEST -- HELP. AND IT EXPOSES THE LACK OF US SINCE THE SENSITIVITY AND SENSE OF URGENCY ALSO. AS WELL AS NO PLANS. TO HOLD THESE PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE POOR RESULTS SO FAR. THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME. DAVID MALL THE REPEAT SITTING SEIU DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES COUNCIL AND I'M RETIRED NOW BUT I WAS A SERVICE COORDINATOR FOR THIRTY THREE YEARS -- AND I'VE HAD CASELOADS IN THE SIXTIES AND I'VE HAD CASELOADS IN THE HUNDREDS. OVER A HUNDRED AND I KNOW WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IN TERMS OF THE DIFFERENCE IN THE QUALITY OF SERVICES ARE I CAN PROVIDE. WHEN YOU GET A CASE LOAD ITS WAY OUT OF COMPLIANCE ALL YOU CAN DO IS MANAGE EMERGENCIES AND THE THINGS THAT THE AUDITOR'S LOOK -- FOR YOUR BILL YOU REALLY GET TO KNOW FAMILIES AND AND SUPPORT FAMILIES IS JUST INCREDIBLY DIMINISHED AND THAT'S ONLY AMPLIFIED FOR SERVICE COORDINATORS. WHO ARE SUPPORTING PEOPLE WHO SPEAK A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH -- THERE YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT MORE. CULTURAL UNDERSTANDING AN EXPLANATION IT'S REQUIRED THIS TRANSLATION THAT'S REQUIRED -- AND IF ANYTHING THEY SHOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER CASE LOADS AND THE REST OF US OFF IN THE END UP HIGHER BECAUSE WE HAVE DIFFICULTY ATTRACTING PEOPLE WITH THOSE KIND OF LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL SKILLS A SERVICE COORDINATOR. WITH THE WAGES WE PAY AND AND THE PROBLEM ISN'T REGIONAL CENTERS ARE TRYING TO HIRE SERVICE COORDINATORS -- AND AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE BUDGET WERE BUDGETED FOR ENOUGH. BUT THE AMOUNT THAT WE BUDGET FOR EACH SERVICE COORDINATOR IS BASED ON NUMBERS. THAT WERE SET IN. TWO THOUSAND ONE AND WE CAN'T PAY PEOPLE TWO THOUSAND ONE WAGES YOU LOOK AT THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS FROM THE DEPARTMENT. NONE OF THEM ARE BASED ON WAGES THAT IT WOULD HIGH COST THEM TO HIRE NEW EMPLOYEES IN -- TWO THOUSAND ONE SO ANYWAY HI COURAGE IS STRONG SUPPORT FOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WELCOME HI JUDY MARK DISABILITY VOICES UNITED I WANNA THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN FOR YOUR INCREDIBLE LEADERSHIP ON THE ISSUE OF DISPARITIES -- YEAR QUESTIONS WERE ARE REALLY AB BUT WHERE IT EFFECTED ME GREATLY - I JUST WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF POINTS THAT -- INTIMIDATION ISRAEL THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS BEING. FABRICATED -- THERE WERE PARENTS WE WANTED TO COME HERE AND SPEAK BUT THEY WERE AFRAID AFRAID THAT SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN TO THEIR SERVICE THEIR CHILD SERVICES -- AND THE OTHER POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER ANY OF THE GREAT OF THE PROJECTS HAVE WORKED WE REALLY DON'T KNOW IT EVERYTHING IS SELF REPORTING.

TO IT'S A LITTLE BIT UNIQUE JUSTICE SICK A NUMBER I'LL BRING IT UP SO WHICH WE TALKED YESTERDAY -- THE WAY WE'VE CONSTRUCTED -- THE WORK WITH CDT IS THIS FIRST PHASE OF MEDS OF DEVELOPMENT IS ACTUALLY YOU COULD CONSIDER PROOF OF CONCEPT WITH IN THE PAL PROCESS. SO THE GOAL IS TO GET SOME LEARNING SACRAMENTO STANDING BEING ABLE TO FINE TUNE. DO WE HAVE THE RIGHT STAFF TO WE HAVE YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE CAN LEARN THAT WOULD THEN INFORM FOR THE APPROVAL FOR THE PROJECT WHICH SHOULD BE PHASES. TWO THREE FOUR SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM -- OTHER PAL -- PROJECTS. THAT'S AT A HIGH LEVEL UNLESS YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. OKAY -- COME A FELLOW COMES. PRIME MINISTER ALEJO -- HI SOME OF MY COMMENTS OF OR EVEN MADE SO I'LL TRY TO KEEP IT SHORTER -- SO AS WAS MENTIONED THIS IS STILL GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS TO PROVIDE LIFE CYCLE TO ANTICIPATED TO COMPLETE IN FEBRUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY AND AS WAS MENTIONED THIS IS BEING USED AS A KIND OF PILOT ARE PROOF OF CONCEPT FOR THE SMALLER COMPONENT OF MEDS THEY TRY A SYSTEM -- TO AT LEAST DEMONSTRATE SOME OF THE UNDERLYING DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS INFRASTRUCTURE -- WE GENERALLY AGREE WITH THIS APPROACH HAS A SIZEABLE COMPLEX PROJECT -- BUT WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS BEING ASKED TO APPROVE FUNDING -- FOR DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE OF THAT PHASE ONE INTO PHASE TWO THERE'S THERE'S A A COMPONENT OF IT THAT'S ACTUALLY STARTING -- WITHIN NINETEEN TWENTY AND SO -- THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THEN HAVE A COMPLETE PROJECT PLAN -- BE READ BEFORE IT AND NOW IT TO ITS EVALUATE -- IN SO WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE APPROVAL OF RESOURCES INTO THE OUT YEARS GIVEN THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE COMPLETE PROJECT PLAN BEFORE US -- BE YOU KNOW IN FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY AND SO TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT JUST ASK THE MINISTRATION TO EXPLAIN WHY -- BUT YOU'RE FUNDING IS NECESSARY FOR FACE TO ACTIVITIES SPECIFICALLY AND THEN TO EXPLAIN WHY THE FOR YOUR LIMITED TERM FUNDING IS NECESSARY FOR THE PROJECT GIVEN LEGISLATURE DOESN'T HAVE A COMPLETE PLAN AT THIS TIME. OKAY FINANCE COMMENTS -- TECHNOLOGY COMMENTS. FROM THAT TECHNOLOGIES PERSPECTIVE THE ESTIMATES FOR THE PROJECT WERE SUBSTANTIATED THROUGH THE MARKET RESEARCH THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS DONE. IN STATES. TO AND LIKE I BRIAN WAS SAYING THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE EFFORT. REQUIRED US TO TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH WITH HOW WERE APPROVING THE PROJECT OVERALL WHERE THEY CAN SUBSTANTIATE THIS THROUGH THE PROOF OF CONCEPT. OKAY THANK YOU. THAT WOULD TO LIKE TO DO YOU HAVE A COMMON SUN VALLEY IS -- DON'T HAVE PLEASE DON'T MIND. SO WITH REGARDS TO THE LIMITED TERM FUNDING FOR THE RESOURCES THAT WE ARE REQUESTING THAT BECAUSE IT'S IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO KEEP CONSISTENT STAFFING -- WHEN IT'S A WIN WIN YOUR GET WHEN YOU'RE BY WHEN YOU'RE FUNDING BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL? YOU KNOW FOR SOME STABILITY Là MOVED TO THE POSITION SO WE'RE REALLY ASKING FOR THIS FOR YEARS TO CARRY US THROUGH WHAT WE BELIEVE WILL BE THE ENTIRE PROJECT. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SOME CONSISTENCY -- ACROSS THE PROJECT NO KNOWLEDGE BASIC CETERA. SO THAT'S THAT WOULD BE THE REASONING FOR THAT. THE SECOND PIECE I CAN'T REMEMBER THE QUESTION WAS NOW -- BOTH ALLOCATING MONEY FOR OR THE FACE TO ADDRESS THESE TWO ACTIVITY WHICH MAY NOT WHICH ONE THE STORY TAKE PLACE UNTIL NEXT BUDGET YEAR RAIDER LATE. OUR RELEASE IN THE SPRING THERE WILL BE ABOUT FOUR MONTHS THAT SAY BUDGET YEAR BUT AGAIN THE RIGHT REMAINDER OF THE FACE TO ACTIVITIES ARE A MORE FIRMLY HOW WE EXERCISE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. SO I THINK THE THE REASON WE'VE REQUESTED THAT IS WE'LL HAVE A CONTRACTOR ON BOARD WHO WILL OF WORK PHASE ONE THE GOAL IS. TO GET APPROVAL WITH CDG AND BE ABLE TO MOVE DIRECTLY INTO PHASE -- TWO THE PROJECT YOU KNOW IT IF WE HAVE A DELAY OF FOUR MONTHS AWAITING APPROVAL OF FUNDING FOR THE NEXT PHASE WILL ALSO END UP HAVING A RESOURCING ISSUE WITH REGARDS TO OUR DEVELOPMENT UNDER BECAUSE NO WORK. YOUR RESOURCES MOVED OTHER PROJECTS THAT ARE SO WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT IT FOR CONSISTENCY AND NOT HAVING A DELAY. IN MOVING THIS PART IN MOVING THIS FORWARD K. SO. IN JAPAN IF I CAN ALSO ADD -- TO CYNTHIA'S COMMENTS THAT -- IN IN LIEU OF COMING BACK EVERY YEAR THROUGH THE THROUGH THE BUDGET CYCLE THERE ARE OTHER CHECKPOINTS BUILT INTO THE PROCESS -- THAT WILL KEEP THE COST M. CAPPED AT A AT A CERTAIN LEVEL SO. AGAIN IF IF THROUGH THE PROOF OF CONCEPT WHENTHE PROJECT HAS TO FINALIZE THEIR ENTIRE PROJECT COST. IF THE TOTAL PROJECT COST -- OVER FIVE MILLION THERE'S CAUSE FOR PAWS FOR US TO DISCUSS HOW THAT HOW THE PROJECT WOULD MOVE FORWARD. ADDITIONALLY ONCE THIS PROJECT IS AN IN FLIGHT AND THERE IS -- THEY ARE ACTIVELY WORKING ON PROJECT ACTIVITIES. THE DEPARTMENT WILL FURNISH A PROJECT STATUS REPORT DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY WILL FURNISH AN INDEPENDENT PROJECT OVERSIGHT REPORT -- WHICH INCLUDES COST MANAGEMENT IS ONE OF THE FOCUS AREAS THAT WILL REPORT ON SO I GUESS NONE OF YOU ARE HERE FOR THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION WE HAD ABOUT A PROJECT IN THE VOTE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES -- BUT I'M TRYING TO MAKE SIMILAR COMMENTS AND DO IT -- MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING I THINK THAT -- GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS -- WE PRIDE NEED TO THINK ABOUT. GIVEN THE NATURE OF TIME LINES AND SO FORTH -- BECAUSE I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT CONTINUITY AND AND AND SO FORTH AND I APPRECIATE THE ACTIONS THAT TO BE SURE WE ALSO MAINTAIN LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND WHEN I SAW LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT IT'S NOT JUST THE MONEY PART SO WHAT THE RESPONSE IS ALWAYS BEEN WELL YOU KNOW ABOUT THE MONEY. IT'S ADDRESS. AND IT IS TO SOME OF THAT FOR EXAMPLE SOMEONE MAY COME AND I THINK -- YOU TOO BYE KNOW THIS BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE WHENEVER WE HAVE OUR HEARINGS RIGHT SOME OF THE STAKEHOLDER MAY COME AND SAY LOOK YOU KNOW THE THE PRINT OUT YOUR AND WAS IN FACE TO YOUR FIGURE OUT YOU'RE A WHAT THE SCOPE AND SO FORTH AND THE DAY HE DIDN'T. HEAR FROM US ARE DATED -- DARE NOT LISTENING TO US WE SAID THAT -- YOU KNOW YOU YOU'RE NOT COOPERATING THIS INTO YOUR UNDERLYING PROJECT DESIGN OR WHATEVER ELSE RIGHT AND SO THAT OVERSIGHT IS NOT JUST THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IT'S ALSO ABOUT BEING SURE THAT -- BEFORE WE ACTUALLY PURCHASE -- RIGHT OR EVEN SEND OUT THE R. F. P. AND SAY THIS IS THE PARAMETERS THAT WERE ABLE TO COME IN AND AND AND AND HAVE THAT CONVERSATION IF. A STAKEHOLDER OR SOME OTHER OTHER PEOPLE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT IT RIGHT AND AND WORK THAT OUT BEFORE WE ACTUALLY DON'T INSTEAD OF TRYING TO PLAY CATCH UP LIKE -- WELL NOW THEY ARE FEES OUT WE DON'T LIKE THIS WE WANT TO PULL BACK OR LIBERAL THAT'S EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE. AND RIGHT RECOGNIZING THAT ALSO THE PURCHASING OF THIS DOESN'T ALWAYS FIT NEATLY INTO OUR USUAL BUDGET CYCLES. SO -- SO BUT I DO THINK THERE'S WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE MECHANISM BY WHICH WILL HAVE AS WE CAN SAVE YOU KNOW WILL. OUT WILL APPEAL BUDGET THE MONEY BUT THE MONEY ACTUALLY DOESN'T GET RELEASED UNTIL WE THE LEGISLATURE HAVE SOME SORT OF A THING YOU KNOW THAT THE PROOF THAT PHASE BEFORE EDL SO. WHEN YOU PHRASE ON THE FACE TO WORK WELL WE GET A CHANCE TO LOOK AT AND SAY YEA OR NAY BEFORE IT MOVES ONWARD -- BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE ALTERNATIVE IS LIKE WHICH IS THE BUDGET THE MONEY AND THEN YOU HAVE THE PROBLEM YOU TALK ABOUT SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE DO THIS AND I THIS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS ISSUES COME UP. AND AND I DO WANT TO SUPPORT I THINK I'VE BEEN A BIG SUPPORTER OF THE NEW PROCESSES TO AND I ALWAYS SAY THAT YOU KNOW EVERYONE'S ALWAYS NERVOUS ABOUT IT PROJECTS IN THE STATE'S ACTUALLY DO A LOT OF THE VERY WELL -- YOU HEAR ABOUT THE DISASTERS HE HAD -- BUT THE ONES ARE GOING WELL BUT WE BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BE SURE THAT OVERSIGHT PIECE IN THERE BECAUSE AND FORTY TWO BY MY TO MAKE COLLEAGUES OF FORTY HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE WAS IT DIDN'T WORK ALSO AND DON'T LIKE THAT EXPERIENCE. SO -- SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEX WITH HIM WE TALKED AND SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO TALK TO YOU -- I SEE A STATUS HERE I THINK SHE WAS LISTENING TO THAT CONVERSATION FROM LA -- BUT I MEAN THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS THAT PROCESS BY WHICH WE CAN SORT OF BRIDGE THOSE ISSUES RIGHT WE DON'T WANT TO SLOW THE PROCESS DOWN WE WANT TO MAKE IT MORE EXPENSIVE BY. PUTTING CAL GUMMING UP THE WORKS BUT SAME TIME. WE NEED TO BE ABLE -- TO TO WAY YEAH AND WHEN WE NEED TO WAY AND SO -- AND HOW WE DO THAT IN A WAY THAT'S MORE SEAMLESS IN THE PROCESS [inaudible] YES. I JUST NOTICED MY COLLEAGUES CINEMATIC MENTIONED DURING THE DDS DISCUSSION THAT -- THAT THE USE OF PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE IS CERTAINLY AN OPTION HERE IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS OF INTEREST AT THE SUBCOMMITTEE SOME NOW SO I THINK SOMETHING PROBABLY OF THAT NATURE WHERE -- WERE BASICALLY WE WOULD BE ABLE. TO BEFORE THE MONEY WOULD ACTUALLY BE ABLE BUDGET BUT BEFORE CAN ACTUALLY BE RELEASED YOU KNOW WE HAD SIGNED OFF ON IT. AND THIS AND THIS SAID IF IT TURNS OUT NO ONCE EVERYTHING'S GOING HUNKY DORY IS LIKE -- YEAH SURE -- IT'S FELL OVER HEARING FROM STAKEHOLDERS THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SAY HAVE THAT CONVERSATION SAY OKAY WHAT'S GOING ON WHERE WE HEARING FROM PEOPLE THERE'S A PROBLEM. AND THE THING AND HOW WE FIXING IT BEFORE WE GO AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PHASE. SO WE CAN WORK SOMETHING OUT AND TRIM TRAILER BILL BUT ALSO WE SHOULD DO THINK A LOT MORE SYSTEMATICALLY HOW IT HOW WE DO THIS TO SELL THAT WERE NOT -- DOING IT PROJECT BY PROJECT ALL THE TIME CELL. ANY COMMENTS FROM. THERE IS NEEDED FROM. FEATURED SOCIAL SERVICES WE APPRECIATE YOUR RECOGNITION OF THE VARIETY OF UNCERTAINTIES AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PROJECT IT'S BEEN ON THE PLATE SINCE -- NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WOULD LIKE TO MOVE FORWARD QUICKLY TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT NOT JUST ON THE ON THE DOLLAR PIECES A LOT OF THE PROJECT DOCUMENTATION DOES BECOME PUBLICLY AVAILABLE -- AS A MATTER OF PRACTICE WE FOUND THAT ON ON MOST OF OUR LARGE IT PROJECTS CD S. CARES AYE HSS AND OTHERS THE SAWS. THE QUARTERLY OR SEMI ANNUAL BRIEFINGS FOR ALLEGE STAFF OF MORE LEGISLATORS THAT MAY CHOOSE TO CALM IS. IS A A GOOD POLICY IT BRINGS EVERYBODY ALONG EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS WHAT WE'RE DOING TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR THAT AND THE RECOGNITION WE ALSO DON'T WANT FOUR MONTH PAUSES AT THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING RIGHT EXACTLY.

THREE EX OFFICIO MEMBERS FROM COVER CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES AND CALPERS -- THE TRAILER BILL WOULD REVISE AND OR CAST THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD BE THE WOULD BE TO REPORTS REQUIRED UNDER THE TRAILER BILL. THE FIRST DUE IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY WOULD INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM LOOKING AT VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE SYSTEM. OPTIONS FOR STATES OPTIONS THAT THE STATE CAN TAKE IN THE NEAR TERM -- FOR TRANSITION TOWARDS A SINGLE PAYER FINANCING SYSTEM THOSE TO BE ISSUES LIKE COST CONTAINMENT QUALITY IMPROVEMENT -- REORGANIZING OUR STATE HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS. THE FIRST REPORT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE OPTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR TO CONSIDER OF REGARDING FUTURE THE COVERAGE EXPANSIONS. THE SECOND REPORT WOULD BE DUE IN FEBRUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT REPORT WOULD -- INCLUDE OPTIONS FOR THE X.

AS BEFORE THE SPURS REASONABLE TO IMPLEMENT LEGISLATION OKAY FINANCE [inaudible] MARGIE. JUST WANNA MAKE A CLARIFICATION ON BOTH THE SOLUTIONS FOR A. B. THREE FIFTEEN IN AB -- TWENTY SIX SEVENTY FOUR WANNA CREDIT THE DEPARTMENT FOR LOOKING AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE ONE SOLUTION THAT WOULD PROVIDE -- MEET THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES FOR BOTH -- ASSEMBLY BILLS -- SO THE INVESTMENT MADE WOULD NOT JUST BE FOR FOR ONE SYSTEM OR ANOTHER BUT AN ENTIRE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM THAT CAN BE LEVERAGED TO SOLVE BOTH NEEDS OKAY SO IT IS SO I DID WANT TO CLARIFY BECAUSE THE LIGHT -- IS IS THAT WE'RE NOT JUST. UPGRADING THE EXISTING ONE ARE WE GETTING AND NOW. TO STRUCTURE OF WHAT WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH THE I. T. THEN THE EFFICACY OF EXISTING SYSTEM YOUR AUGMENTING IT TO TO HANDLE THIS OR ARE YOU REPLACING SOMETHING. OKAY IT IS A BRAND NEW SOLUTION THAT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED OKAY THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS HEARING IS IT'S ACTUALLY THIS IS A NEW NEW SYSTEM THAT RIGHT TO THE CURRENT BUT WE HAVE TWO DISCRETE SYSTEMS THE FILING SYSTEM THAT WE ADDRESSED AND THE PROVIDER COMPLAINTS SYSTEM BOTH. OF THEM OUR LEGACY SYSTEMS VERY OLD HAND BUILT AND VERY DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN. AND SO THE PROPOSAL IS TO REPLACE BOTH SYSTEMS WITH -- ESSENTIALLY THINGS YOU CAN BUY OFF THE SHELF THAT CAN BE MODIFIED FOR USE AND THEN -- LEVERAGED AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY SAID FOR MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT SO WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THIS STAGE TWO ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS. LOOKING AT A SINGLE PLATFORM TO RESOLVE BOASTS A PROP BOTH THE TITLE ISSUES OKAY SITS BUT JUST TO CLARIFY SINCE THIS IS OFF THE BOOKS LIKE YOU'RE LOOKING AT OFF THE SHELF SOLUTIONS THEN THE OF TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX THOUSAND OF FOR LEASE THIS PARTICULAR ITEM -- IN ONE TIME CAUGHT CONTRA COSTA UPGRADE THE SYSTEM -- SO THIS ISN'T LIKE THIS IS JUST THE INTRODUCTORY AMOUNT OF MONEY TO THE AND I MEAN I MEAN WE GOT TO SPEND MORE MONEY TO BUY THE SYSTEM I GUESS I MEAN IS THAT THE FUTURE EXPENSE. OF THOSE WHAT SO I SEE THERE'S MAINTENANCE MONEY ON FOR A PLATFORM LICENSING COSTS BUT THAT BASICALLY WILL COVER THE CENTURY THE NEW SYSTEM. RIGHTSENATE CANDIDATE THESE ARE AT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A DIFFERENT SOLUTION THAN THOSE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT RIGHT SIGN. DIFFERENT SIZE AND COMPLEXITY -- BASED ON THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THIS EFFORT AT LEAST WHAT WE KNOW AT THIS TIME -- IT'S IT'S SUBSTANTIATED THAT THE DEPARTMENT RECEIVED THE MONEY IN THIS BUDGET YEAR -- BECAUSE WERE EXPECTED TO GET PROJECT APPROVAL THIS CALENDAR YEAR RIGHT OKAY SO JUST TO CLARIFY WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE BASICALLY LICENSING A ON OFF THE SHELF PRODUCT TO SERVICE FUNCTION WE DON'T THEREFORE NOT INVESTING IN BUYING A NEW SYSTEM AND SO. THIS COVERS THE ENTIRE COST THAN. IT DOES COVER THE ENTIRE COST YEAH. OKAY JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT OKAY. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT -- WITH THAT -- IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON TO PROPOSALS. SEEING NONE THANKS VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT [inaudible] OKAY. NOW MOVING ON TO DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS. SO WE HAVE I THINK NINE ISSUES FOR STATE HOSPITALS. AND I DON'T THINK ANY OF THEM INVOLVE I.

ALRIGHT LET'S MOVE ON ISSUE NUMBER FOUR LOCATIONAL SERVICES INPATIENT MINIMUM WAGE. SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS. RIGHT. INTRODUCE YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD. GOOD EVENING. GOOD EVENING CHRISTINE'S COUNTY CHIEF COUNSEL FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS OKAY AND I'LL BE SPEAKING TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR REGARDING VOCATIONAL SERVICES AND STATE MINIMUM WAGE. OKAY. MARCELO WAKE UP. CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OKAY THANK YOU ARE GONNA. STATE HOSPITALS. THANK YOU AND I THINK WE HAVE A NEW PERSON AT FROM FINANCE AT THE TABLE HERE. I'M GOING TO BERMAN FINANCE THANK YOU ALL RIGHT. THESE BEGIN. SURE THANK YOU. THIS B. C. P. SIX ONE PERMANENT FULL TIME POSITION AND A GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION OF THREE MILLION THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FISCAL YEAR. NINETEEN TWENTY AND THEN AN ONGOING PREPARATION OF THREE MILLION THREE AND FORTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS -- AS WELL AS APPROVAL OF ASSOCIATED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS PCP IS TO IMPLEMENT A NEW AND COMPLIANT WAIT STRUCTURE. FOR OUR VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION PROGRAM. THE GOALS ARE REALLY TO STANDARDIZE THE PATIENT WHICH STRUCTURE ACROSS OUR VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION PROGRAMS -- TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL LAW AND TO REDUCE THE RISK OF POTENTIAL ADVERSE LEGAL ACTIONS ASSOCIATE WITH OUR CURRENT NON STANDARDIZED WAGE STRUCTURE -- THE PATIENT WORKERS -- ARE PART OF THE PROGRAM'S REALLY THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO GIVE THEM LIFE AND CAREER SKILLS AND PREPARE THEM FOR DISCHARGE. LOSE LIKE A STORY A WORKER KITCHEN WORKER LANDSCAPER -- THEY'RE PAID A WAGE FOR THAT WORK WITH THAT WEIGHT IS NOT BEEN STANDARDIZED ACROSS THE HOSPITAL'S NOR ACROSS THE DIFFERENT PATIENT COMMITMENT TYPES AND HASN'T BEEN CONSISTENT FOR THE WORK PERFORMED -- SO THIS PC P. SIX TO REMEDY THAT. WAGE FOR THE PATIENT WORKERS WITH TWO EXCEPTIONS THOSE WOULD BE FOR THE CITY SORRY MATES UNDER PENAL CODE SECTION TWENTY SIX EIGHTY FOUR WHO ARE EXEMPT AND WHO BE PAID ONE DOLLAR AN HOUR. AND AS WELL AS PATIENTS THAT WE HAVE PARTICIPATING IN A SHELTERED WORKSHOP AT ADIDAS EACH NAPA. THE ONE PERMANENT POSITION WOULD BE TO STANDARDIZE -- THOSE PEOPLE PROCESSES AND TO DO THE REQUIRED WITHHOLDINGS. AND THE TRAILER BILL IS TO CLARIFY THAT THE PATIENT WAGES -- WOULD BE EXEMPT FROM THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE AND AS WELL AS TWO APPLY WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS IN CASE AND A PATIENT WAS INJURED. AND DISCHARGE SO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THOSE BENEFITS AVAILABLE TO THEM. THEY ALSO JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT WE DID HAVE A SPRING FINANCE LETTER WHICH WAS A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT TO THIS PROPOSAL WHICH REDUCES THE REQUEST BY HUNDRED FIFTY ONE THOUSAND WAS JUST DUE TO A CALCULATION ERROR IN THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL. THANK YOU ALEJO [inaudible] FINANCE. SO I DO HAVE TO POSE A QUESTION WHY A THE I KNOW IT'S LESS BUT WHY THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE IN WHERE WEEKS AT THE SELF FROM THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE SINCE IT THIS. SURE SURE NO I I THINK THE IT'S A LOGICAL QUESTION I WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE IT'S REALLY DESIGNED TO CARE FOR THINGS SUCH AS FOOD HOUSING THOSE SORTS OF COST THAT PEOPLE IN HER. AND SO WHERE IS THE S. H. PROVIDES HOUSING AND MEDICAL CARE -- THOSE ARE ALREADY YOU KNOW BUILT IN INTO OUR BUDGET TO WHAT WE PROVIDE THE PATIENTS ARE REQUIRED TO TO PAY FOR THOSE EXPENSES SO THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE WE THINK PROVIDES THE APPROPRIATE BALANCING COMPENSATING THEM FOR THE THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT THAT THEY PROVIDE BUT REALLY THIS IS A THERAPEUTIC. PROGRAM DESIGNED TO GIVE THEM LIFE SKILLS. SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY THE FOCUS OF THE PROGRAM. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL I AND EIGHT YES A UNDERSTAND YOUR RATIONALE -- THAT IS SOMEONE WHO SUPPORTED OUR STATE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE. BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT -- WHAT MESSAGE FOR SENDING TO PEOPLE WE TELL THEM THAT THEY CAN DOWN WE HAVE A MINIMUM WAGE IN THE STATE WE'VE -- THAT THAT SIGNED INTO LAW ON THAT SAUDI CARE FOR MESSAGE WE SAID THE PEOPLE ON WE DON'T. GIVE THEM THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE AND I RECOGNIZE WHAT HE SAID THAT. THEY'RE ALSO GETTING OTHER BENEFITS -- THAT ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE WAGE -- BUT SEVEN EIGHT DALE. SO I UNDERSTAND BUT NOT NECESSARILY SURE -- FULL AGREEMENT BUT OKAY THANK YOU. RIGHT. LET'S MOVE ON THEN -- O ISSUE NUMBER FIVE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. OKAY INTRODUCE YOURSELVES FIRST FOR THE RECORD. AND KATE WERE WRITTEN ON THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR FOR STATE HOSPITALS. AUDREY BASESTAR AND FINANCE THANK YOU PLEASE BEGIN. FOR THIS REQUEST -- WE REQUEST A PERMANENT FULL TIME POSITIONS AND ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY TWO POINT TWO MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWO POINT FOUR AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND TWO POINT SIX MILLION. ON GOING -- THIS IS THERE WAS ALSO IS OFFERING FINANCE LETTER ASSOCIATED WITH THIS -- PROPOSAL WHICH REQUESTED -- PORTION OF THAT FUNDING THREE AND SEVENTY THOUSAND ANNUALLY IN REIMBURSEMENTS AND THIS IS TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAM OUT DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS NAPA. AND TO EXPAND RESOURCES FOR NURSING RECRUITMENT AT THREE OF OUR HOSPITALS. AND WE DO EXPERIENCE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION CHALLENGES FOR BOTH PSYCHIATRY NURSING OUR HOSPITALS ARE HIGH RISK -- EMPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENTS WITH HIGH WITH PATIENTS WITH HIGH ACUITY AND A SIGNIFICANT VIOLENCE RESTS WE ALL HAVE HIGH OCCUPANCY -- WITHIN OUR HOSPITALS AND HIGHER CASELOADS THAT OUR STANDARD -- WE ALSO YOU KNOW THERE NATIONALLY. THERE'S INDUSTRY SHORTAGES FIRST MOST PSYCHIATRISTS THE NURSES AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE -- PAY DISCREPANCIES -- THIS PROPOSAL HAS TWO COMPONENTS THE PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAM WHICH WE PROPOSED TO PARTNER WITH TORO UNIVERSITY TO DEVELOP AN EMPLOYER CONSORTIUM COMPRISED OF M. D. S. H. TORO IN AS WELL AS TO ADDITIONAL COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO CREATE A NEW PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAM. THIS WE REQUEST ONE PROGRAM DIRECTOR IN A PROGRAM ASSISTANT TO ESTABLISH THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM. AND THE GOAL IS TO OPEN THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO OUR FIRST COHORT OF FOR RESIDENTS AND THEN WE WOULD GROW BY FOUR RESIDENTS PER YEAR TO WE GET. TO SIXTEEN AND WHILE THEY'RE IN ROTATION WITH THIS WITH THIS IS A GREAT BENEFIT TO US BECAUSE THEY WILL BE THEY WILL HAVE THEIR OWN PATIENT CASELOADS. AS WELL AS WILL BE TOMORROW AND DEVELOPING A COHORT OF PSYCHIATRISTS THAT ARE ENTERED INTEREST AND IN WORKING WITH OUR FRIENDS AT POPULATION. THE SECOND PORTION OF THIS IS FOR NURSING INSTRUCTORS AND WE ARE REQUIRED UNDER OR I'M ALL FOR AN INSTITUTION CODE SECTION FORTY THREE TWENTY TO ESTABLISH AN EDUCATION TRAINING PROGRAM. TO PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS FOR HOSPITALS AND SO WE DO PARTNER -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE WITH EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS THAT -- FOR THE TRAINING OF BOTH I AM REGISTERED NURSES AND PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS AND SOME OF THE PARTNERSHIPS ARRANGEMENTS WE DO PROVIDE THE NURSING INSTRUCTORS AS WELL AS FACILITIES -- OUT OUR HOSPITALS IN ORDER -- FOR TO OPERATE THE TRAINING PROGRAMS. AND SO WE ARE PROPOSING TO HIRE FIVE NURSE INSTRUCTORS -- THIS WOULD BE THREE IDEAS H. ATASCADERO FOR A PARTNERSHIP WITH CUESTA -- WHEN IT AT NAPA FOR THE PARTNERSHIP AND NAPA VALLEY COLLEGE AND ONE AT COALINGA I'M FOR WITH WEST HILLS COLLEGE? AND THEY WILL HOSPITAL OUT REACH CORNER PART NADER'S FOR RECRUITMENT -- PURPOSES AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE INCLUDED IN THIS PROPOSAL -- ONE HEPA FOR THE SACRAMENTO RECRUITMENT IN IT SO THAT WE CAN EXPAND THEIR FUNCTIONS TO FOCUS ON OUR END IN PT RECRUITMENT AS WELL. EXCELLENT. ANY COMES FROM MILIEU. YES -- WITH RESPECT TO THE PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAM WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE PROPOSAL HOWEVER GIVEN THAT IT'S RELATIVELY COSTLY APPROACH TO FILLING VACANCIES AND IT'S UNCLEAR HOW MANY VACANCIES ULTIMATELY BE FILLED. WOULD RECOMMEND APPROVING IT ON A SIX YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS THAT WOULD GIVE THE DEPARTMENT ENOUGH TIME TO ESTABLISH IT IN THE FIRST COHORT TO GRADUATE AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD. CHOOSE TO STAY TO FILL A STATE VACANCY OR PLAYED MOVE ON SOMEWHERE ELSE AND I WOULD GIVE THE LEGISLATURE MORE INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS AN EFFECTIVE APPROACH -- TO THE EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINED THAT IT WASN'T AN EFFECTIVE APPROACH IT WILL COULD -- CHOOSE TO CONTINUE TO FUND THE PROGRAM TO ALLOW THE RESIDENTS WORRY IN THE PROGRAM TO FINISH FOR IT CAN PROVIDE ON GOING FUNDING WE KNOW THAT THIS APPROACH THE LIMITED TERM FUNDING APPROACH WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH A SIMILAR APPROACH THAT THE ADMINISTRATION. HAS MADE FOR CDC ARE WHERE THEY'RE DOING A RESIDENCY PROGRAM FOR NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND THAT WAS PROPOSED ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS AGAIN. TO ALLOW FOR EVALUATION -- WITH RESPECT TO THE EXPANSION OF THE PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGE. COMMUNITY COLLEGES ON THE SPRING FINANCE LETTER THAT WAS MENTIONED ESSENTIALLY WAS. PUT IN PLACE TO RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN THESE INSTRUCTORS ARE HIRED THEY'LL INCREASE CLASS SIZES WHICH WILL CREATE FUNDING FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THAT CAN BE USED TO OFFSET THE PROGRAM SO WE OBVIOUSLY RECOMMEND APPROVING THE JANUARY PROPOSAL IN THE SPRING DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE. THAT TWO OF THE INSTRUCTORS BEING PROPOSED THIRD THEY'RE NOT PROPOSING TO OFFSET. THOSE INSTRUCTORS FOR THE LIKELY COMMUNITY COLLEGE INSTRUCTIONAL FUNDING THAT BE GENERATED SO WE'D RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REDUCE THE PROPOSAL BY A FURTHER 200-407-0002 ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FUNDING. TO THE EXTENT THE FUNDING ISN'T ULTIMATELY PART OF THE AGREEMENT THEY BROKER WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE THINK THE DEPARTMENT COULD ABSORB IT ON A ONE TIME BASIS AND THEN REQUEST THOSE FUNDS NEXT YEAR. THANK YOU FINANCE -- YEAH I TO BASIS FROM THE FINANCE -- NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD TO DS AGES -- OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSAL JUST I WOULD NOTE THAT -- PSYCHIATRISTS ARE -- FAIRLY EXPENSIVE ON THE AND WE HAVE A SEVERE -- VACANCY RATE AND THE PSYCHIATRIST DESERVES AT STATE HOSPITALS WE ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS ACTUALLY RELATIVELY LOW COST WAY TO FILL VACANCIES AT OUR STATE HOSPITALS -- I WOULD ALSO -- JUST NEW TO CONCERNED ABOUT FOR THE MESSAGE IT SENDS ABOUT THIS BEING SORT OF A LIMITED TERM RESIDENCY PROGRAM. I THINK -- ANY SORT OF INSTITUTION AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION WOULD BE LEERY ABOUT SORT OF ENGAGING WITH US ON A LIMóN TERM BASIS ON THIS -- AND JUST IT IS A HOUSEHOLD HAS NO INTEREST IN CONTINUING SOMETHING IT'S NOT WORKING SO THE EXTENT THAT THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM DOESN'T WORK I THINK BOTH THE UNIVERSITY ANSWERED HOSPITALS ARE ARE NOT GONNA BE INCHING CONTINUING IT -- TO SO I DON'T THINK SORT OF SIGNALING THAT THIS IS IN ANY WAY INTENDED TO BE LIMITED TERM IS IS IS NECESSARY. OKAY AND ANY COMMENTS ON THE VOICE SAID ABOUT THE THE BUDGET ON THE NURSES -- AND IN TERMS OF AND COMMITTEE COLLEGES. YEAH AND JUST AS EASILY AS WE COULD COME BACK AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO COME BACK AND REQUEST FUNDS TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S ADDITIONAL -- REIMBURSEMENTS FROM THOSE COLLEGES WE CAN JUST AS EASILY TAKEN DOWN -- FROM MY UNDERSTANDING -- THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN ENGAGE WITH THOSE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND CURRENTLY THE CONTRACT DOES NOT REFLECT THOSE REIMBURSEMENTS FROM THEM. OKAY. RIGHT SO I WOULD MAKE NOTES -- YOU MAY NOT KNOW BUT I USED TO SIT ON THE BOARD FOR THE TRADITION COUNTS ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION AND I WAS A RESIDENCY DIRECTOR SIDE PAYING A LITTLE MORE ABOUT RESIDENCIES THAN THE AVERAGE BEAR -- SO A COUPLE COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM -- FIRST OF ALL IS THE SECOND TO THE PSYCHIATRIST AND PROGRAM ASSISTANT OTHERS CAN BE STATE EMPLOYEES YES OKAY SO BASICALLY SO THE PROGRAM ALL AND DOES THE AND THE STATE WILL BE THE ONE TO OPERATE TO BE THE DESIGNATED INSTITUTION THAT FOR THE RESIDENCY. WHERE IT WERE NEGOTIATING THAT RIGHT NOW AND THAT MIGHT BE A HEAVY LIFT TO GET RESIDENTS ON THE GROUND NEXT YEAR WE HAVE SOME PARTNERS AT THE TABLE WITH TRUE UNIVERSITY WHO MAY BE WILLING TO BE THE DESIGNATED SITE AND WE WOULD BE THE IMPATIENT AND FRIENDS LIKE EXPERIENCE? RESIDENCY TRAINING INCLUDES AN INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT RIGHT WELL AS AN ALLY USUALLY THERE'S A DESIGNATED SO TO XIN THAT'S THE CENTRAL CONTRACTING AND THEN EVERYONE ELSE'S AROUND OKAY SORRY I'M GETTING A LITTLE IN THE WAY BUT THE THE SO THIS THE PROGRAMMING. SO YOU HAVEN'T STARTED FOR A PROGRAMS I CREDIT YET RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT OKAY SO YOU'RE GONNA SEE CREDIT ATION FOR THE PROGRAM OKAY. AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION I WOULD MAKE NOTICES THAT YOU EVENTUALLY WHEN YOU GO TO SCALE YOU'LL HAVE SIXTEEN RESIDENTS FOR EACH YEAR. AND THE DATE AND THE INTENTION IS IS THAT PER YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO BE IN LINE WITH THE R. C. REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY WILL BE SPENDING LOVE THEIR IN PATIENT. TIMED WITH THE STATE HOSPITALS CORRECT THAT'S RIGHT. OKAY SO I THINK -- THIS IS WHY I A CERTAINLY -- YES -- FIRST OF ALL I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT THAT'S A LOT MAN POWER RIGHT THERE -- THAT YEAR ARE YOU DON'T WORK FOR OUR AND SUCH AS MINUTES MA'AM LIMóN BUT NOW IT'S IT THAT'S A LOT OF WORK THERE SO THERE'S A BIG SYSTEM WORKFORCE FROM THE RESIDENTS THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY CAN PROVIDE CLINICAL SERVICES. RIGHT UNDER SUPERVISION BUT THEY DEFINITELY PROVIDE SO. SO IF YOU JUST COUNT THE RESIDENTS ALONE BEFORE THEY EVEN GRADUATE WHETHER THEY WORK FOR YOU ARE NOT -- THAT REPRESENTS A CERTAIN LEVEL OF CAPACITY THAT YOU'RE BUILDING THERE NOW THEY ARE TRAINEES THEY NEED TO BE A SUPERVISION BUT I WOULD MAKE NOTE RESIDENTS ARE GRADUATES OF MEDICAL SCHOOLS THEY ACTUALLY END UP HOLDING A LICENSE -- SO THEY THEY CAN ACTUALLY BIRD AND THEY ACTUALLY PROVIDE DIRECT CLINICAL SERVICES SO CERTAINLY I THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SUCCESS LEVEL THIS ONE HAS TO RECOGNIZE THAT YOU'RE REBUILDING CAPACITY IF YOU'RE ABLE TO GET THE PROGRAM ACCREDITED -- YOU KNOW I I ALSO THINK THAT. CERTAINLY WHILE YOUR GOALS IS TO GET MORE STAFF PSYCHIATRISTS -- AND I AND ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT MAY COME UP THEIR TRADITIONS THE YOU DO NEED TO HAVE ENOUGH PSYCHIATRISTS ONSITE SUPERVISE ALL THE RESIDENTS -- BUT EIGHT I GUESS I WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE THAT YOU GET MORE I MEAN I THE IS THE EXPECTATION WOULD BE IS LIKE ALL WELL EVERYBODY GRADUATES GONNA END UP SIGNING UP FOR STATE SERVICE I THINK THAT WOULD BE AN UNREASONABLE EXPECTATION BUT HOPEFULLY THAT EXPOSURE. WILL -- GET THE HELP YOU THE OTHER THING THAT YOU MIGHT ALSO WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS IS THAT -- COLLABORATIONS WITH OTHER RESIDENTS IF YOU HAVE YOUR OWN RESIDENCY PROGRAM YOU PRIDE THEIR POSITION TO THINK ABOUT COLLABORATIONS WITH OTHER PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAMS OF PEOPLE ME WHY DO ROTATIONS TO LEARN OF OUR ABOUT THAT SO ONCE YOU HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE UP IT'S A LOT HARDER DO IT IF YOU. DON'T BUT IF YOU HAVE YOUR OWN RESIDENT RATE OF YOUR OWN INFRASTRUCTURE. SO YOU MAY EVEN SOME OF THE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS WHERE THEY MAY SPEND DOWN TIME OVER AT STATE HOSPITALS VICE VERSA YEAR RESIDENTS MAY SPEND SOME TIME AT THEIR HOUSE YOU KNOW TO TO LEARN MORE ABOUT OTHER TYPES OF THINGS BUT THAT. HOPEFULLY THAT TREATS MORE EXPOSURE ALSO CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO RECRUIT -- MORE BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE A MORE FAMILIARITY IS WITH THE NATURE OF THE WORK -- AT THAT STATE HOSPITAL SO -- ON A PRE SHEET LA AS PERSPECTIVE ON THE FUNDING BUT I A ESTIMATE AS A EDUCATION PROGRAM DIRECTOR [inaudible] THE IN KNOWING THAT YOUR FINDINGS GOT IT SAY SECURITY FOR YOUR COMMITMENT EVERY TIME YOU MIDDLE CLASS OKAY BECAUSE YOU YOU CAN TRAIN PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE AND ACTUALLY THAT'S GOING TO BE A FACTOR AND ACCREDITATION DECISION. TO THEIR ESSAYS ARE GOING TO BE SUSTAINABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING. AND OUR COMMITMENT I SHOULD SAY IT'S NOT SO ITS COMMITMENT TO THE TRAINING SO. AND CERTAINLY IF IT TURNS OUT THIS IS QUOTE NOT SUCCESSFUL YOU KNOW YOU CAN WIND IT DOWN -- THERE'S GONNA BE SOME WORK THERE BECAUSE AGAIN YOU CAN'T LEAVE PEOPLE STRANDED -- AND SO. A SO I THINK THE MAIN ISSUE IS GOING TO BE IS THAT -- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY. THE YOUNG OPEN TO THINKING ABOUT DOING THIS -- TO FIND THAT BUT FIRST OF ALL YOU -- WE NEED TO WE NEED REPORT BACK WHEN NOT HOW YOU ACCREDITATION PROCESS GO BECAUSE NO RECORDATION A RESIDENCY RIGHT. SO. AND SO ANYWAY. ALL RIGHT. OKAY WELL AS PRIDE MORE THAN IF I WANNA HEAR ABOUT IT BUT I COULD GO ON FOR AWHILE. I CAN EVEN PROVIDE CONSULTATION HOW YOU GET YOUR RESIDENCY PROGRAM. BUT WE WILL DO THAT HERE TODAY CAN RATHER LATE OKAY MOVING ON THE ISSUE NUMBER SIX CORD VALUATIONS REPORTS. THIS ITEM REQUESTING FORTY THREE PERMANENT FULL TIME POSITIONS AND EIGHT POINT ONE MILLION IN NINETEEN TWENTY AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY FOUR POINT FIVE PERMANENT FULL TIME POSITIONS AND FIVE POINT NINE MILLION IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE ADDITIONAL SEVENTEEN POINT -- ONE PERMANENT FULL TIME POSITIONS AND FOUR POINT TWO MILLION IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FOR A TOTAL OF NINETY FOUR POINT SIX POSITIONS AND EIGHTEEN POINT ONE MILLION ON GOING. THIS IS. OBVIOUSLY BASED ON ACROSS THREE FOR A YEARS -- INTO BEEN THIS IS TO PROVIDE RESOURCES NEEDED TO PERFORM THE FORENSIC SERVICES WORKLOAD THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH COURT DIRECTED PATIENT TREATMENT RELATED TO SERVING. PATIENTS FOR COMMITTED TO US IS EITHER INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL NOT GUILTY BY REASON AND SANITY IN INDIA OR SB P. PATIENTS -- THIS PROPOSAL WILL PROVIDE RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED TO PERFORM THE FORENSIC WORKLOAD WHICH INCLUDES FRIENDS YOU CAN BUY YOU ASIANS REPORTING TO THE COURT. COURT TESTIMONY FRIENDS A CASE MANAGEMENT DATA TRACKING INNER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT -- SEVERAL YEARS AGO WE INITIATED A COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT TO EVALUATE OUR STAFFING AMONGST THE FIVE STATE HOSPITALS AND FOR AND AND TO PERFORM CLINICAL STAFFING STUDIES WHICH WAS COMPRISED OF FOUR COMPONENTS. AND THIS PROPOSAL IS AS THE POP AIDS ESTABLISHES POPULATION DRIVEN METHODOLOGIES THAT ARE THE OUTCOMES OF ONE OF THOSE COMPONENTS THE HOSPITAL FORENSIC DEPARTMENT. AND IT INCORPORATES ALL THE DATA AND RESEARCH THAT WAS CONDUCTED BY OUR DS EIGHT RESEARCH TEAM DURING THE STOPPING STUDY AND THROUGH THE COLLABORATION WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE RESEARCH ANALYSIS UNIT THROUGH THE MISSION BASED REVIEW WITH OUR DEPARTMENT. AND ADDITIONALLY -- WE DID CONTRACT WITH CORPORATE PERSONAL SERVICES TO CONDUCT AN INDEPENDENT BY IT VALIDATION OF THE STAFFING STUDY DATA AND METHODOLOGIES THAT WERE PRESENTED. THERE'S THREE MAIN COMPONENTS TO THIS PROPOSAL A IT REQUEST FIFTY THREE POINT ONE FORENSIC EVALUATOR POSITIONS FOR THE HOSPITAL FRIENDS EX SRVICE DEPARTMENTS THAT'S BASED IN ACROSS THREE YEARS. OF THESE DEPARTMENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FRIENDS AGO VIOLATIONS OF COURT REPORTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRIENDS LIKE A PATIENT'S -- THIS FUNCTION REQUIRES FRANTICALLY TRAINED PSYCHOLOGISTS OR PSYCHIATRISTS AND UNDERSTAND THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN THE LAW AND THE PHILOSOPHIES OF THE PRACTICE CAN FORMER FRIENDS BECAUSE SUSSMAN OF A PATIENT WHICH CAN INCLUDE MENTAL COMPETENCY SYMPTOMS DIAGNOSIS PROGRESSION AND TREATMENT. AND VIOLENCE RESTORED SELF AND OTHERS AND THE PREPARE REPORTS THE COURT AND TESTIFY IN COURT TO COMMUNICATE AN UNBIASED CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE OF THE PATIENT AS IT RELATES TO THE STATUTORY CRITERIA DIRECTING THE FRIENDS A COMMITMENT. THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT FUNCTION FOR SYSTEM LAST YEAR WE SERVED OVER NINETY EIGHT HUNDRED FORENSIC PATIENTS AND MAINTAIN AN AVERAGE DAILY CENSUS OF OVER FIFTY THREE HUNDRED FRIENDS OF PATIENCE. FOR EACH FRIENDS A COMMITMENT TYPE THEIR STATUTORILY REQUIRED REPORTS THAT PRESCRIBED TIED TIME INCREMENTS WITH AN INPATIENT STAY AT OUR DEPARTMENT. LAST YEAR WE FILED APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN THOUSAND REPORTS THE COURT REGARDING OUR FRIEND SICK PATIENTS -- ALSO -- INCLUDED IN THIS -- COMPONENT IS SIXTEEN POINT THREE ADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS -- FOR FRIENDS A CASE MANAGEMENT AND DATA TRACKING PHASED IN OVER TWO YEARS. AND WITH ALL THE ACTIVITY AND REPORTS THAT REPORTED -- FOR THESE FRIENDS ARE -- PATIENTS THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DATA AND TRACKING OF WHEN REPORTS ARE DUE -- TO INSURE THAT THE REPORTS ARE FILED TIMELY ADDITIONALLY MANY CLINICIANS ARE SUBPOENA AND CALLED TO TESTIFY IN COURT REGARDING THEIR EVALUATIONS WHICH IS ALSO A FUNCTION THAT REQUIRES COORDINATION AND TRACKING. SO THIS PROPOSAL DOES STANDARDIZE THE ADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS ACROSS OUR HOSPITALS PERFORM THIS WORKLOAD AND ALSO PROVIDES MY POSITION AT EACH HOSPITAL TO LEAD THE SUBPOENA AND TEST MAY IN THE DATA TRACKING. THE THIRD COMPONENT OF THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDES TWENTY FIVE POINT SEVEN POSITIONS FOR NEUROPSYCHOLOGY ASSESSMENTS AND COGNITIVE REMEDIATION PILOT PHASED IN OVER TWO YEARS. THIS RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR INCREASED COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT REMEDIATION TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS MANY OF OUR PATIENTS HAVE SIGNIFICANT COGNITIVE DEFICITS AND CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCE IT EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CLINICAL TREATMENT AGGRESSIVE ACTS OR IN A COULD CONTRIBUTE TO LONGER THINKS OF STAY. A CURRENT RESEARCH IDENTIFIES THAT APPROXIMATELY 50% OF ALL NEW MISSIONS MAY ACTUALLY REQUIRE SECONDARIES NEUROPSYCHOLOGY TESTING AND CAN CERTAINLY THIS FOR YOU -- THESE REQUESTED RESORT RESOURCES WILL PROVIDE FOR TESTING FOR UP TO ABOUT 25% OF ADMISSIONS. ADDITIONALLY IT WILL ALSO ALLOW US TO IMPLEMENT AN OR A PSYCHOLOGICAL KIND OF REMEDIATION TREAT A PILOT AT METROPOLITAN AND NAPA. AND THIS IS A FOCUS TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS HAVING SIR A SERIOUS EXCUSE ME SEVERE NEUROCOGNITIVE DEFICITS. AND IT WILL PROVIDE PRIORITIZE PATIENTS WHO ARE AGGRESSIVE LIKELY TO ACHIEVE RAPID BENEFIT FROM THE INTERVENTION AND ARE LIKELY TO IMPROVE THEIR FUNCTIONALITY. AND TREATMENT WILL BE DELIVERED VIA COMPUTER BASED -- TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND TREATMENT AND THREE TREATMENT GROUPS. AT THE PROPOSAL WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU COMMENTS MY LAYOFF. YES SO WITH RESPECT TO THE CLINICIANS WHO'D BE DEDICATED TO THE EVALUATIONS ONE OF THE PRIMARY JUSTIFICATIONS AT THE DEPARTMENT GAVE FOR THESE CLINICIANS IS. TO RESOLVE THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST THAT EXISTS WHEN THESE CLINICIANS CARRY OUT EVALUATIONS FOR THEIR OWN PATIENTS. WE THINK A PROMISING ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE IS TO HAVE THE CLINICIANS CARRY OUT THESE EVALUATIONS AND RELATED WORKLOAD FOR OTHER CLINICIANS PATIENTS. SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE NOT APPROVE THE FUNDING. TO ATTACH TO THE CLINICIANS AND INSTEAD DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT TO PILOT THIS PEER REVIEW APPROACH THAT I DESCRIBED ON IN ADDITION WITH RESPECT TO THE FRIENDS A CASE MANAGEMENT AND DATA TRACKING POSITIONS -- THE DEPARTMENT WASN'T ABLE TO PROVIDE US WITH DATA SHOWING THAT THEIR EXISTING STAFF WERE UNABLE TO HANDLE THE WORKLOAD. AND SO FOR THAT REASON WE'RE NOT RECOMMENDING THAT IN ADDITION THERE WAS -- SOME ADDITIONAL STAFF THAT WERE BEING RECOMMENDED TO HELP REFINE THIS STAFFING STANDARDS THAT WOULD DRIVE THE CLINICIANS AND I SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER SINCE WE'RE NOT RECOMMENDING APPROVING THOSE POSITIONS. pNECESSARY. WITH RESPECT TO THE FUNDING PROPOSED FOR THE NTERNAL PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENTS. GIVEN THAT THIS CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO IDENTIFY VIOLENT PATIENTS AND IMPROVE TREATMENT WE DO RECOMMEND FUNDING THAT PART OF THE PROPOSAL. AND FINALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE COGNITIVE REMEDIATION PILOT WELL WE THINK IT'S A PROMISING APPROACH WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING ON GOING FUNDING FOR A PILOT AND SO INSTEAD WE RECOMMENDED THAT THE FUNDING BE PROVIDED ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS. AND THAT A REPORTING REQUIREMENT BE PUT IN PLACE. I THANK YOU FINANCE ALLEN'S ARMY YES I I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THIS -- THIS B. C. P. IS THE OUTCOME OF A MISSION BASED -- REVIEW PROJECT -- TO WITH THAT DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS SO -- TO BERMAN FINANCE WAS OF MUCH MORE ENGAGED IN SERVE HELPING DEVELOP AND AND WORK THROUGH THIS PROPOSAL THAN WE ARE WITH MOST -- IN RESPONSE TO THE LA GOES -- COMMENTS -- SO AND MANAGING IS A PEER REVIEW IS THAT THE WOULD HAVE A TREATING A CLINICIAN BOTH SERVING THEIR OWN PATIENTS AND THEN ALSO SORT OF DOING THESE FRIENDS OF VALUATIONS OF OTHER -- CLINICIANS PATIENTS -- BASICALLY AT IT WITHIN THE CURRENT THE WAY CURRENTLY CURRENTLY THAT WOULD WORK THAT WOULD MEAN WE BASICALLY NEED ADDITIONAL PSYCHIATRISTS IN ORDER TO DO THAT RIGHT TO HAVE A TREATING CLINICIAN PSYCHIATRIST AND THEN THAT PSYCHIATRISTS LITTLE SWEETNESS FRIENDS CASE LORD. CASELOAD I THINK ELLIE -- RECOGNIZES THAT WE WOULD NEED ADDITIONAL POSITIONS FOR THAT BECAUSE STATE HOUSE WAS NEVER REALLY BEEN STOPPED FOR THIS FORENSIC THIS THIS GREAT OF OUR FRIENDS A CASELOAD -- WE JUST KNOW THAT PSYCHIATRISTS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO GET ON THE AND FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGISTS. ARE US SIGNIFICANTLY EASIER TO SORTOF HIGHER -- AND SO WE WE THINK OUR PROPOSAL WOULD SORT OF MEET THIS NEED -- MUCH MORE EFFICIENTLY AND CHEAPER I MIGHT ADD -- ON THE CASE MANAGEMENT PIECE ON THE WAY THERE ARE EXISTING STAFF WITH THE AND STATE HOSPITALS ARE DOING SOME OF THIS FRIENDS SIX OR THE MINISTRY OF CASE MANAGEMENT WORKLOAD AND WE DID ACCOUNT FOR ALL OF THOSE EXISTING STOP IN OUR PROPOSAL -- THIS OULD BE ACCOUNTING -- FOR TIMES WHEN THERE ISN'T DEDICATED STAFF TO FRIENDS WORKLOAD IT'S KIND OF BEING DIGGING UP AMONGST THE POSITIONS OR ADMINISTRATIVE STUFF THAT HAD OTHER DUTIES. SO WE REALLY DID -- PLACE THESE SORT OF CASE MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATIVE PEOPLE WHERE WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE EXISTING RESOURCES I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THIS IS ALL THIS REPORTING TO THE COURT AND ALL THE TRACKING A HOUSE TO BE DONE IT'S NOT OPTIONAL -- AND TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS DOING IT IT'S MUCH CHEAPER THAN HAVING CLINICIANS DO IT -- AND ON THEN NEURO PSYCH ON THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT -- APPROACHING THIS ON A PILOT BASIS. SO I ACTUALLY ANY FURTHER OF COLOR FELLOW FROM WHAT FINANCE SAID. THE ONLY THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY IT'S IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT RELIC WHICH APPROACH WOULD BE MORE OR LESS COSTLY THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS FIGURE OUT IN THE PILOT -- BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE PSYCHIATRISTS CARRYING OUT THIS WORKLOAD WE JUST HAVE THEM CARRY OUT THIS WORK LOAD. FOR OTHER PSYCHIATRISTS PATIENTS WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT COULD CREATE A SITUATION WHERE -- IT REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT OF ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD SO THERE MAY BE ON THE MARGINS THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL PSYCHIATRIST BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR TO US THAT THAT WOULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE RECOMMENDING. OKAY SO JUST TO CLARIFY BECAUSE CURRENTLY I MEAN THE RECOGNIZE THAT. THIS IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE SITUATION IS IS THAT PSYCHIATRISTS ARE BOTH TAKING CARE OF THEIR PATIENTS IN. REVIEWING THE CASES RIGHT AND YOU'RE SAYING WE NEED TO SEPARATE THE TWO AND THAT MAKES SENSE BUT IN TERMS OF WORKLOAD. THEIR RATE DOING BOTH SO. THAT'S ENTREES SO SO I MEAN IT'S GREAT THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE NO SO I AM LOOKING AT THIS AND SAYING THERE'S A LOT OF EXTRA PEOPLE INVOLVED. AND NOT SAYING THAT DOWN AND THE THAT IS SO FROM A WORKLOAD STANDPOINT. THEN WE TAKE OFF THE PART THAT THEY'RE REVIEWING AROUND PATIENTS THAN EITHER THEY CAN SEE MORE PATIENTS WITH THAT EXTRA TIME OR THEY CAN REVIEW SOMEONE ELSE'S THE CELL OR I GUESS THAT'S ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HERE ARE YOU SAYING THAT WELL ACTUALLY WE ARE SO SHORT. THEY'LL HAVE PLENTY OF EXTRA PATIENTS TO SEE AN OWNERSHIP THIS TO SOMEBODY ELSE. I MEAN AT THE ESSENTIALLY YES I MEAN WITH PSYCHIATRISTS ARE ARE READY IS SORT OF COVERING MORE THAN ONE UNIT WHERE IDEALLY WE'D LIKE TO HAVE A PSYCHIATRIST PER UNIT AND ON TOP OF THAT THEY'RE DOING THIS FORENSIC -- CASELOAD WHICH SOMETIMES REQUIRES THEM TO ACTUALLY GO TO COURT AND TESTIFY IN COURT WHICH THEN PULLS ME AWAY FROM THE FLORIDA THOSE THOSE CELLS LIKE ACTUALLY YOUR SOLUTION IS. TO REMOVE THE PSYCHIATRISTS FROM THE COURT YEAH HE'S. A PSYCHIATRIST TO DO THE TREATMENT PART OF THEIR JOB AND BE ABLE TO DO IT BETTER AND MORE. SORT OF MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF THE PSYCHIATRISTS THAT WE DO HAPPENS REFUSAL LATELY JUST OKAY YES FINANCE NO I WOULD JUST ADDING CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG HERE BUT I BELIEVE THESE -- CLINICIANS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE WRITING THE REPRTS AND THEN GOING TO COURT AND TESTIFYING. ON THOSE PATIENTS AS WELL AND SO THERE'S LIKE. I THINK THAT I I NEED TO BE A DIVIDE OF THAT CONFLICT OF INTEREST OF THEM RIGHT IN THE REPORTS I THINK. DR WARBURTON PRICE BECAUSE UPON A LITTLE BETTER THAN I JUST SOME GENERAL POINTS ABOUT FRIENDS LIKE A VALUATIONS THESE ARE -- ASSESSMENTS EVALUATIONS REPORTING AND TESTIMONY WHICH ARE ALL SKILLS AND ABILITIES THAT ARE NOT TAUGHT IN ANY GENERAL RESIDENCY OR PSYCHOLOGY TRAINING PROGRAM -- IT REQUIRES A LOT OF POST. GENERAL TRAINING -- EITHER IN A FELLOWSHIP OR IN A POST DOC OF FRIENDS A POSTDOC EXPERIENCE SO IN ADDITION TO THE ISSUES OF DUAL AGENCY. WHERE THE LITERATURES CLEAR THAT IF YOU HAVE A PATIENT THAT YOU'RE TREATING? AND YOUR DUTY IS TO THAT PATIENTS -- THERE'S A CONFLICT IF YOU'RE ALSO DOING FRIENDS EVALUATION WHICH YOUR DUTY IS TO THE COURT -- SO YOU HAVE JUST NOT JUST THE DUAL AGENCY ISSUE WHICH I'M NOT SURE WOULD BE RESOLVED BY THE LA -- SUGGESTION BECAUSE OUR PATIENT MOVEMENT IS SO COMPLEX NUMBER DEDUCTIBLE THERE'S NO SAYING THAT IF YOU'RE THE EVALUATOR TODAY WON'T BE THE TRIGGER TOMORROW. BUT THERE ARE THE ADDITIONAL IT -- ISSUES OF A LACK OF TRAINING -- THAT ARE A GENERAL PSYCHIATRIST OR PSYCHOLOGIST HAS AS WELL AS JUST SKILLS AND ABILITIES -- NOT EVERYONE WHO ON THOSE INTO MEDICINE IS GOOD AT DOING FORENSIC VALUATIONS WRITING REPORTS AND TESTIFYING IN WE HAD HAD SOME ISSUES WITH THAT OKAY [inaudible] SO. SO WHY YOU USE USES A PSYCHIATRIST THEMSELVES TO SHOULD BE DOING ON THERE ARE PATIENTS ARE DOING A GOOD JOB AT IT. IT WAS. TO A GENERAL SURGEON DOING HER TRANSPLANT IT'S JUST SOMETHING YOU HAVE SOME FOUNDATIONAL TRAINING FOR BUT YOU DON'T HAVE THE ADDITIONAL SUBSPECIALTY TRAINING OKAY. SO I GUESS WHAT'S HELPFUL IS TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF REALLY WHAT IS THE SONG I KNOW YOU WENT THROUGH THIS TO TO THE BETTER SENSE OF THE WERE THE EXACTLY WHAT IS THE WORKLOAD SO WHAT. I'M HEARING NOW AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU GOT THE INFORMATION FROM THE ALEJO'S IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE REALLY DOING IS SAYING OKAY WE WANT TO TAKE THE PSYCHIATRISTS. HAVING JUST FOCUS ON PATIENT CARE RGHT. RIGHT AND THEN BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF THEM SELL WOODS SO WHY SHOULD WE OWE IT WILL EXPAND OUR WORK FORCE WE WENT TO BECAUSE THE CHARACTERS HAVE AND JUST FOCUS ON THE PATIENT CARE PIECE. AND THEN THIS FORENSIC EVALUATION PIECE WE'RE GOING TO BRING IN A WHOLE BUNCH OF FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGISTS NEW PEOPLE. AND HAVE THEM JUST DO THAT PARTS WERE SIR BIFURCATING THE JOB HERERIGHT AND TELLS THE CHARACTERS TO THE PSYCHIATRY PART AND HAVE THE FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGIST TO THE FORENSIC PIECE AND THEN. YEAH. SO YES SO ESSENTIALLY UNDER THE LA -- APPROACH TO THIS -- WE'D BE A LOT. CLOSER TO OUR CURRENT SYSTEM THE ONLY BIG CHANGES THAT. CLINICIANS WOULD DO THAT WORKLOAD FOR OTHER CLINICIANS PATIENTS RATHER THAN THEIR OWN SO WELL LET ME JUST POSE THE QUESTION I MEAN. SO THE THE OTHER BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS IS THAT ACTUALLY THE THE PARTS THEY HOSPITALS ARGUING THAT. THE CURRENT WORKFORCE ISN'T SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO START WITH RIGHT SO WE'RE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ADDING PEOPLE RIGHT AND THEY SAY THAT THE MOST EFFECTIVE THING IS THAT FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGISTS VERSUS. GETTING MORE PSYCHIATRISTS SAID THAT THAT. I MEAN IS THAT IT DID WAS THAT SOMETHING YOU LOOKED AT IN TERMS OF SO I AGREE THAT YOU'RE PROCESSING THAT ACTUALLY LEAVES THE WORK FORCE ABOUT THE SAME THEY'RE SAYING ACTUALLY ONE EXPAND THE WORK FORCE -- AND AND THIS IS OUR APPROACH TO DO IT RIGHT RIGHT AND SO UNDER OUR APPROACH WE WOULDN'T EXPAND THE THE WORK FORCE AT LEAST NOT AT THE TO THE EXTREME EXTEND IT COULD BE THAT YOU NEED A FEW ADDITIONAL TANK TO HANDLE IT -- BUT THAT BUT ESSENTIALLY -- WE DIDN'T FEEL THAT WE WERE PROVIDED WITH SUFFICIENT DATA TO SHOW THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL PSYCHIATRISTS THAT THE CURRENT PSYCHIATRISTS ARE ARE INSUFFICIENT. AND NOW I UNDERSTAND YOU DID DO A WHOLE BIG STUDY RIGHT YEAH WE DID DO A WHOLE BIG STUDY -- AND I DON'T REALLY STATE HOSPITALS THAT DID A LOT OF GROUNDWORK BEFORE WE EVEN GOT THERE RIGHT SO WHAT THEY DID -- A LOT OF ON ACTUAL SORT OF IN DEPTH ANALYSIS OF WHAT ACTUALLY THE FORENSIC WORKLOAD IS AND WE HAVE TONS AND TONS OF METRIC SAYING EXACTLY HOW MUCH TIME YOU SHARE THAT WITH LA -- THEN TO THE WOULD HAVE THAT INFORMATION IT'S THE IT'S INCLUDED AS ATTACHMENTS TO THE B. C. B. SO [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] YES. YEAH. ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IS WHAT ADDITIONAL -- BENEFIT COULD WE EXPECT FROM CLINICIANS BEING ABLE TO DEDICATE MORE TIME TO THEIR PATIENTS WOULD WE SEE LINK TO STAY GO DOWN WHAT WE SEE TREATMENT IMPROVE. AND THAT WAS THE SORT OF THING THAT WE'RE FOR A SO MAYBE WE CAN HAVE SOME COMMUNICATIONS DECLARE FITTED TO TO CLARIFY THE BENEFITS SO. OF THE EXTRA CLINICIAN HAPPY TO MEET WITH LA ON THIS ONE ANYTIME OKAY ALL RIGHT OKAY. VERY HELPFUL OKAY [inaudible] THAT'S A AND I THINK ON A EIGHT I THINK ON THE PILE ON THE ISSUE THE PILOT THAT CERTAINLY WE WOULD I DEFINITELY WANT TO REPORT. ON THE PILOT SO IT'S A THE CARD IN REMEDIATION PILOT CELL. USUALLY A PILOT WOULD BE OF A FIXED TIME WITH THE REPORT THEN WE DECIDE WHAT DO I CONTINUE FUNDING IT BASED ON THAT REPORT CELL. RIGHT. OKAY ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN DIRECT CARE NURSING [inaudible] SABRINA. WELCOME. INTRODUCE YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD. MY CHANNEL OUTER A CHIEF OF THIS GONE PROGRAM RESEARCH THANK YOU. THIS ITEM REQUESTING THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE POINT FIVE NURSING POSITIONS AND FORTY FIVE MILLION. A IN GENERAL FUND PHASED IN OVER THREE YEARS TO SUPPORT THE WORKLOAD OF PROVIDING THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CARE NURSING SERVICES AT THE FIVE HOSPITALS. THE REQUEST ALSO INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR TEMPAT POSITIONS AND FIFTY ADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS HE'S OUR POSITIONS ONLY NO DOLLARS. TO IMPLEMENT THE STAFFING STANDARDS IDENTIFIED IN THE STAFFING STUDY. AS WITH THE PREVIOUS STOPPING STUDY WE JUST DISCUSSED THE STAFFING STANDARDS PROPOSED -- ARE BASED ON DATA THAT WAS COLLECTED AND AT THE RESEARCH CONDUCTED BARI OUR RESEARCH TEAM IS LED BY MISS LOUDER. AND WORKED THEM WITH THEIR WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH THE LAUGHS I RESEARCH ANALYSIS UNIT AGAIN THROUGH THE MISSION BASED REVIEW PROCESS. AND WE ALSO CONTRACTED WITH UNIVERSITY OF IRVINE TO PERFORM AN INTAMIN INDEPENDENT VALIDATION OF THE DATA AND METHODOLOGIES THAT WERE PRESENTED IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL. CURRENTLY BUDGETED FOR NURSING STAFFING RATIOS -- AT FOR Q. AND SKILLED NURSING UNITS -- ON AM AND PM AT ONE TO SIX AND FOR KNOCK ONE TO TWELVE AN INTERMEDIATE UNITS OF ONE TO EIGHT ON AND I AM AND PM AND FOR KNOCK. ONE TO SIXTEEN THESE RE ISSUES OR THE MINIMUM NURSING STAFFING REQUIRED UNDER OR THEY'RE A CUT CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS TITLE. TWENTY TWO TO MAINTAIN REGULATORY COMPLIANCE HOWEVER DUE TO OUR PSYCHIATRIC AND MEDICAL NEEDS OF OUR PATIENTS. AND THE VIOLENCE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE PATIENTS ACTUAL NURSING STAFF THAT WE DELIVER IS HIGHER THAN WHAT WE'VE TO TRADITIONALLY BEEN BUDGETED. FOR THE STAFFING STUDY CATEGORIZE OUR HOSPITAL TREATMENT UNITS IN TWO GROUPS BASED ON VARIABLES THAT DRIVE STOPPING LEVEL SUCH AS TREATMENT TYPE AND COMMITMENT TYPE. AND WE LOOKED ACROSS -- SIX MONTH OF ACTUAL STAFF A DELIVER DATA TO CALCULATE SYSTEM WIDE STAFF TO PATIENT REVIEWS FOR EACH GROUP TO BE USED IN PLACE OF THE CURRENT STAFFING RATIOS. SO THE SPECIFIC COMPONENTS F THE FUNDING IN POSITION REQUEST INCLUDE -- FIRST OF ALL THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIAN POSITIONS AND THIS IS INCLUDING RELIEF TO STAFF. TWELVE OUR MEDICATION ROOM POSTS ON A HUNDRED TWENTY UNITS BUFFETS IN OVER THREE YEARS TO PERFORM FUNCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICATION PASS. A MEDICATION PASSED A CURSE FOUR TIMES PER DAY AND MAY LAST UP TO TWO HOURS PER PASS. THERE'S MANY FUNCTIONS THAT INCLUDE A FOR PREPARATION ADMINISTERING AND DOCUMENTATION AND ULTIMATELY MANAGING THE MEDICATION. DISTRIBUTION OF PROCESS -- WITHIN THE UNIT -- WE ALSO CURRENTLY THE PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS THAT PERFORM THIS FUNCTION ARE INCLUDED IN OUR OF RATIOS AND WE ARE PROPOSING BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THEY NEED TO PERFORM THIS TASK -- TO PULL THEM OUT OF THE COUNT AND PROVIDE THIS AS AN ACT SENATE INTENTIONAL -- POSITION ADD TO ALLOW MORE STUFF TO REMAIN ON THE FLOOR AND TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN ADDITION TO THOSE POSITIONS THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES FORTY FOUR POINT FIVE SUPERVISING REGISTERED NURSE POSITIONS INCLUDING RELIEF. AND THIS IS TO STAFF ADDITIONAL TWELVE HOUR POST TO PROVIDE ON SITE SUPERVISION HONOR PM INOX SHIPS AND THESE POSITIONS WHAT ARE PROPOSED TO BE PHASED IN OVER TWO YEARS. CURRENTLY THE UNIT SUPERVISORS AND SUPERVISING REGISTERED NURSES SERVE AS THE FIRST LINE SUPERVISORS FOR FACILITIES OF WITH ONE ALLOCATED PER UNIT HOWEVER THE SUPERVISORS ARE -- SCHEDULED FOR A FIVE DAY PER WEEK POSITIONS AND SO BUT THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTINUOUS MANAGEMENT SUPERVISED VISION ON THEIR UNIT ON A TWENTY FOUR HOUR BASIS. SO WHILE THERE ARE SHIFTS LEANS ASSIGNED TO EACH UNIT THEY'RE NOT SUPERVISORY POSITIONS SO CURRENTLY FOR THAN I AM PM AND KNOCK SHIPS WE DO USE AN ON CALL POSITION TO PROVIDE THE THE SUPERVISORY -- TO PERFORM SUPERVISORY FUNCTIONS AND TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS THAT OCCUR IN THE NIGHT. SO THIS PROPOSAL WENT OUT A TOTAL OF SEVENTEEN TWELVE HOUR I'M SUPERVISOR POSTS ACROSS THE FIVE HOSPITALS TO COVER THOSE SHIPS -- WHICH WILL EXPAND ON SITE SUPERVISORS FROM EIGHT HOURS TO TWENTY HOURS PER DAY COVERAGE AT OUR FACILITIES. IN ADDITION TO THOSE TO REQUEST. FOR ADDITIONAL UNIT BASED POSITIONS -- WE ALSO HOW ARE REQUESTING THAT BY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR TEN HELP POSITIONS THESE ARE JUST -- POSITIONS ONLY AND THIS IS TO INCREASE THAT ARE TEMP HELP THE FORTY TO REGULATE RECOGNIZE THE USAGE LEVELS WE CURRENTLY THAT WE USE INTO IT. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND THEN ALSO POSITION FORTY ONLY FOR FIFTY ADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS AND THIS IS WE ADDED LOOKED ACROSS ALL OF OUR AND MINUTE A NURSING CLASSIFICATIONS TO SEE IF THEY WERE REPORTING -- POSITIONS THAT COULD BE BETTER PERFORMED BY ADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS AS A THIS WOULD ALLOW US I AM -- TOO FILL THOSE WITH ADMINISTRATIVE FOLKS AND THEN RETURN THE NURSING POSITIONS BACK TO THE UNITS. AND THEN FINALLY WE PROPOSE TO REALIGN STOPPING RESOURCES ACROSS THE HOSPITALS TO MEET THE STAFFING LEVELS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE STAFFING STUDY WHICH INCLUDES BOUNCING ALL OF OUR AUTHORIZED POSITIONS ACROSS THE HOSPITAL SAID THAT THE POSITIONS ARE MORE EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTED. THANK YOU COMMENTS FROM ILLEGAL. YES SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD FOR THE DEPARTMENT WE THINK A LOT OF THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED ARE. A WAY TO BRING A LOT OF GREAT GREATER DEAL TRANSPARENCY TO THE BUDGET AND SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE PROPOSED STANDARDIZATION OF NURSING STAFFING RATIOS. THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FOR TEMPORARY HELP POSITIONS IN THE DEDICATED BUDGET FOR OVERTIME AND THE FIFTY ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF TO REDUCE THE ADMINISTRATIVE WORKLOAD THAT'S CURRENTLY CARRIED OUT BY NURSES. HOWEVER WE ARE SOMEWHAT -- WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE CURRENT STAFF THEY OR THEIR STAFFING RATIOS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED ARE REFLECTIVE OF CURRENT PRACTICE WHICH HAS NOT BEEN EVALUATED DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT IT'S OPTIMAL. AND IN FACT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE RESEARCHERS THAT WERE USED TO VALIDATE THE STUDY NOTED THAT IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO REVIEW STAFFING IN THE FUTURE TO ENSURE THAT IT IS OPTIMAL. ARM AND SO WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE ALSO DIRECTED THE DEPARTMENT TO CONTRACT WITH AN INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT. TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT THE STAFFING BOTH FOR NURSES AND FOR THE PART MORE GENERALLY IS -- OPTIMAL AND TO REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO THE REPORT THE READER THE RESULTS OF THAT ANALYSIS. WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPOSED DEDICATED STAFFING FOR MEDICATION ROOMS WERE RECOMMENDING -- THAT INSTEAD OF IMPLEMENTING THIS ON ON ACROSS ALL FIVE HOSPITALS THAT WE DO IT ON A PILOT BASIS BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT. AND IT WASN'T CLEAR TO US THAT THE BLAKELY BENEFITS THAT THAT ARE THAT THE BENEFITS OF THE DEPARTMENT IS HOPING FOR WOULD BE OBTAINED. SO WE'D RECOMMEND IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED SEVEN POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THREE YEARS WHICH WOULD BE. ENOUGH TO STAFF -- TWENTY FOUR MEDICATION ROOMS WHICH WOULD GIVE THE DEPARTMENT ABILITY TO STOP THESE PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS ACROSS A WIDE VARIETY OF UNIT TYPES. ON AND THEN EXAMINE WHETHER OR NOT IT DOES RESULT IN THE BENEFITS THAT ARE HOPE FOR LIKE BUT YOU KNOW REDUCTIONS IN VIOLENCE IN AN IMPROVEMENT IN OUR COMES. WITH RESPECT TO THE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT SUPERVISORS WE THINK THAT THIS IS A REASONABLE NEED AND WOULD RECOMMEND APPROVAL. THANK YOU FINANCE AND THIS WAS ALSO ONE OF THE MISSIONBASED I REVIEW PROJECTS WE WORKED ON THIS -- KICKED OFF I BELIEVE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN WITH A VERY ON LINKING ANSWER -- THOROUGH SURVEY OF THE STATE HOSPITALS IN THEIR STAFFING RATIOS -- AND THEN YOU SEE YOU SEE IRVINE CAME IN FOR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME VISITED SEVERAL HOSPITALS -- AND SPENT A LOT OF TIME WORKING WITH STATE HOSPITALS ON THE PROPOSAL -- AND THEN -- MY TEAM CAME IN AND AND SPENT ABOUT A YEAR WORKING WITH STATE HOSPITALS ON THIS SO. IN MY FIFTEEN YEARS OF FINANCES IS PROBABLY THE BEST ANALYZE B. C. P. I'VE I'VE EVER DONE IT SO -- I I DON'T KNOW THAT ANOTHER SORT OF INDEPENDENT -- ANALYSIS OR CONSULTANT ONE WOULD REALLY SORT OF YIELD DIFFERENT RESULTS I'M ALSO NOT SURE WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND SOMEONE WITH THAT. EXPERTISE ON STATE HOSPITALS TO TO DO SUCH A AN EVALUATION -- IT'S A SORT OF A NICHE -- FIELD. AND IT'S A GOOD USE IT TOOK A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST A LONG TIME TO GET UP SPEED ON SORT OF WHAT THE OPERATIONS ARE OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE HOSPITALS -- I WOULD ALSO. NOTE THAT IT'S WHEN WE LOOK AT SORT OF WHAT THE STATE HOSPITAL STAFFING RATIOS WERE -- THEY ARE FAR BELOW THE AVERAGE -- THAT JUROR THAT HAVE -- PRIDING DIRECT CARE STAFF BEING ON THE UNITS -- AS COMPARED TO THE US OR OTHER HOSPITALS IN THE WESTERN PSYCHIATRIC STATE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE'RE SORT OF AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PACK. IN TERMS OF WRITING DIRECT CARE TO PATIENTS -- I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE PROPOSAL -- BEFORE US ALSO BRINGS -- US UP TO SERVE THE AVERAGE -- STAFFING LEVELS ARE PROVIDED ON PSYCHIATRIC UNITS AT ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA THAT WAS BASED ON IT UC DAVIS STUDY THAT WAS DONE. SO -- AND THEN THIRDLY I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT -- AT THE RATE SAID AFTER MILLION WORKERS COMP AMONG THE NURSING -- CLASSIFICATIONS IS A HOUSEHOLDS ARE EXTREMELY HIGH SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF OUR CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS AT OUR PRISONS -- AND WE FEEL LIKE A COMBINATION OF ALL OF THOSE MEANS THAT SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT NEEDS TO BE DONE IT'S PROBABLY NEED TO BE DONE FOR FOR QUITE SOME TIME [inaudible] HEY. RIGHT WELL IT IS CERTAINLY A OF CREATURE THAT THIS IS A VERY THOROUGHLY ANALYZED THE C. P. -- AND EIGHT DAY PRE SHEET THAT. SEE HOSPITALS I MEAN THE ONLY THIS PROPOSALS FOR USEFUL ANYWHERE THE REALLY LOOKING AT THE STAFFING -- I WOULD. THE I THINK WHAT I HEARD FROM THE LA -- WAS NOT THAT LET'S REDO THE EVALUATE BUT LET'S DO OF AT ONCE AFTER WE IMPLEMENT LET'S. LET'S VALUE EIGHT HOW ALL THIS IS GOING IS THE IS NOW THAT WE'VE DONE THIS. YOU KNOW HOW OR WHERE ARE WE SELL MAEVE INVOLVED THE SAME EVALUATORS WHO RIGHT NOW THOUGH ALL THE PROCESS EASIER NOW THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY. OF THE VETTING AND VARIOUS PUBS CAN HAPPEN IN THE ROAD RIGHT SO YOU CREEK VACANCIES YOU TALK ABOUT RECRUITING HOUSE BECAUSE WE IN THE RECRUITING -- THAT'S ADDRESS ARE AND EIGHTIES PEOPLE ARE NOW LOOKING AT IT THEN THEY'RE GOING WELL MAYBE WE COULD DO THINGS A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY FEEL MORE EFFICIENT -- OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND IT'S GIVEN THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF OF OF THIS. EFFORT TO AND AND STAFFING -- ILL SOME REVIEW AFTER IMPLEMENTATION TO SEE HOW HOW THINGS ARE GOING WHERE WE ACTUALLY ENDED UP SO I KNOW YOU'RE ASKING FOR THE MONEY IN THE POSITIONS NOW EXACTLY HOW THAT ALL PLAYS OUT IN THE END. THE IT IT THIS TRIAL THE THING WORST SIDE REAL IT'S TAKES A LITTLE MORE MONEY TO DO THAT. YEAH I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT -- STATE HOSPITALS HAS A RESEARCH UNIT ACTUALLY THAT RIGHT WAS BASICALLY DIDN'T ALL THE HAVING LIFTING ON THIS AND THAT IS THE GOAL AND THE INTENTION IS TO SORT OF CONTINUE TO EVALUATE. HOW THIS IS WORKING WHAT IMPACT DOES IT HAVE A VIOLENCE WHAT MAX IS A HOUSE ON ON FMLA WORKERS COMP ALL OF THOSE IS SO IT IS OFFERING A BILL REQUIRING THE REPORT VIOLENT INCIDENTS YES SAVED THAT THE YEAH? RIGHT SO SO -- SO THAT IS ALWAYS BEEN SORT OF A GOAL IS SORT OF CONTINUING TO LOOK AT THIS AND ALSO AS POPULATIONS CHANGE MAY BE YOU KNOW DOWN THE ROAD WE HAVE A DIFFERENT MIX OF UNITS THAN WE HAVE RIGHT NOW AND AND WE NEED. TO SHIFT TO AND REEVALUATE SO IT'S NOT INTENDED TO BE SORT OF THE PERFECT PICTURE OF WHAT THE STAFFING NEEDS TO BE AND AND WE STAY ON FOREVER MORE AT SECOND ROW THAT WE GOT THIS METHODOLOGY RENT CONTINUE TO EVALUATE AND SO SO I GUESS I WOULD -- THAT'S THE AS FOR DELLY IS RECOMMENDATION THAT SOME FORM OF THE VALUATION POSE STILL OVER THIS WILL BE IN THE CLOSE OF LIMITATION BE DONE SO WE CAN SEE THERE ARE SOME THINGS MAY CHANGE I MEAN AFTER ALL THERE. ARE PROPOSALS EVEN TO TRY -- TO SO IT WITH THINGS MAY CHANGE AND AND THAT NOW THAT YOU FOR THE WE APPROVE THIS. THE BUDGET THEN AFTER ITS IMPLEMENTATION EXACTLY HOW WHAT HOW HOW YOU DOING RIGHT WHERE WHERE WE AND MEAN IDEALLY -- YOU PUT OUT THE OF MONEY AND YOU PEOPLE YOU FIND PEOPLE AND THEY FILL ALL THE POSITIONS RIGHT AWAY AND EVERYTHING'S ALL HUNKY DORY BUT THEN ALSO HAPPY RIGHT AWAY THAT IS ACTIVE EXACTLY I I I I KNOW IT DOESN'T DATE SO ACTUALLY WHY WE DID THE OTHER PROPOSAL. ON RECRUITMENT AND TO HAVE BECAUSE WE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE TRYING TO GET INTO THESE NURSING PROGRAMS ARE COMMUNICABLE JUST WE JUST DON'T HAVE. ENOUGH SPACE IN THE CLASSES OF THOSE REALLY TO KIND OF WENT HAND IN HAND WITH THIS OFFICIAL ALL RIGHT. OKAY. OKAY LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT FULL SCHOOL WHICH IS PHARMACY MODERNIZATION. GOOD EVENING I'M RAJAN SERVICE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER FOR THE DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS THANK YOU AND IT IS EVENING. IT IS INDEED IN FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY WE'RE REQUESTING TWO POINT TWO MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND. THIS FUNDING WILL REQUEST WILL SUPPORT THE COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFE CYCLE STAGES TO MODERNIZE OUR PHARMACY EQUIPMENT. AND PROVIDE INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE. IN OUR EXISTING PHARMACY OPERATIONS WE HAVE DESPAIRED BACK AND SYSTEMS THAT CREATE SILENT APPROACH TO PHARMACY OPERATIONS. WE MANUALLY TRACK MEDICATION INVENTORY. THE PHARMACISTS ARE EQUIPPED WITH OUTDATED EQUIPMENT OR NONE AT ALL. AND THEY'RE UNABLE TO PROCESS NEW NATIONAL DRUG CODES REQUIRED FOR ACCURATE BILL IN. AS A AS A RESULT WE ESTIMATE ABOUT ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN TRAVEL WASTAGE EACH YEAR. STAFF HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR ADMINISTERING MEDICATIONS AND CORRECTLY AND MEDICARE PART D. BILLING CLAIMS HAVE A LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATE. THE PROJECT PLANNING STAGES THAT ARE INCLUDED WITH THIS REQUEST WILL CONCLUDE IN FISCAL YEAR. NINETEEN TWENTY AND POSITIONS THE POSSESS THE DEPARTMENT TO EXECUTE A PHARMACY SYSTEM THAT WILL DEREASE DRUG WASTAGE. INCREASE COST RECOVERY ENHANCE OVERALL PATIENT CARE AND PREPARES FOR AN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD. OUR GOALS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH STANDARDIZING OUR UNIT DOSE REPACKAGING AN AUTOMATED DISPENSING MACHINES INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE DATA INTEGRATION. PATIENT SPECIFIC MEDICATION BILLION AN OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES [inaudible] COMPASS MILIEU -- YES WE DON'T HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL BUT WE WOULD KNOW THAT THIS -- IS AN IMPORTANT PROJECT TO SCRUTINIZE CLOSELY BOTH BECAUSE THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROJECT WILL DETERMINE WILL HELP DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD REACHES ITS FULL POTENTIAL. AND ALSO WILL SERVE AS A TEST AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE DEPARTMENT IS ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT A LARGE IT PROJECT LIKE THIS AND SO TO THE EXTENT YOU SEE pPROBLEMS HERE. IT WOULD ALERT YOU TO THE FACT THAT YOU MAY RUN INTO PROBLEMS WITH ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD AND LIKE WAYS TO THE EXTENT THIS GOES SMOOTHLY THAT BODES WELL FOR THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD. I THANK YOU FINANCE. A DIFFICULT FIGHT THIS PROPOSALS JUST FOR THE PLANNING TEAM REYES IT'S NOT SEE THE ACTUAL TOWER THIS PLANNING OKAY. RIGHT VERY GOOD THANK YOU FOR YOUR WISHES OKAY AND FINALLY ISSUE NUMBER NINE TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS VARIOUS -- I THINK WE DON'T NEED TO GO INTO. DETAIL ON EACH ONE OF THEM I WOULD NOT DO THAT -- SO THIS IS JUST TO RECALL A REQUEST TO REALIGN RESOURCES IN NINETEEN TWENTY AN ON GOING GOING TO PROPERTY A LINER BUDGET POSITION AUTHORITY WITHIN OUR EXISTING RESOURCES IT IS IN NET ZERO PROPOSAL. AND REALLY THESE ARE JUST RECOGNIZING SOME ADJUSTMENTS THAT NEEDED TO BE MADE -- PRIMARILY A I WOULD NOTE THAT WE HAVE HAD -- SOME CHANGES IN OUR BUDGET -- PRESENTATION AND STRUCTURE OR I'M IN THE RECENT YEARS -- MOSTLY AS WE PREPARED TO MOVE TRANSITION TAPE HAS CAL AS WELL AS TO BRING TRANSPARENCY -- GREATER TRANSPARENCY TO OUR BUDGET AND SO -- AS WE MOVED IN SHIFTED ITEMS ACROSS FROM -- WHEN STRUCTURE TO THE OTHER THINGS I MAY HAVE GOTTEN PLACED IN THE WRONG BUCKETS AND SO WE'RE MAKING SOME ADJUSTMENTS AND THEN THERE'S SOME OTHER OPERATIONAL CHANGES THAT ARE BEING AND ADJUSTED FOR AS WELL IN THE SIDE TECHNICAL? ADJUSTMENTS OKAY THANK YOU. ANY COMMENTS ALL TECHNICAL RE OKAY FINANCE NOW IT'S ALL RIGHT. OKAY -- SO WITH THAT WE LOOK. ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THE ISSUES RELATING TO THE APARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS SO ONE THROUGH. NINE RIGHT WELCOME FOR CHECKER CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA IN ISSUE NUMBER FOUR ON THE STATE -- MINIMUM WAGE PROPOSAL -- WE APPLAUD THE ADMINISTRATION FOR MOVING FORWARD TO FOR THESE PATIENT WORKERS TO BRING THE BOTH THE STANDARDIZATION BUT ALSO TO BRING UP THE TO THE MINIMUM WAGE I THINK YOU ASK THE RIGHT QUESTION MISTER CHAIR -- WHY WOULD WE GO TO THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE AS OPPOSED TO THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT SHOULD BE? THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE AND AND NOT CREATE THIS -- EXEMPTION THAT -- HAS IMPACTS BROADER -- THEN I THINK JONES THAN JUST THIS PROPOSAL. WE WOULD ALSO SUGGEST. THAT THERE IS A A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR CAP IN STATUTE DOWN FOR THE AMOUNT THAT CAN BE RETAINED IN THE PATIENT'S FUNDS OTHER WHY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT OTHERWISE. IN THE AMOUNTS THAT TO EXCEED THAT CAN BE -- SWEAT FROM THE ACCOUNTS FOR A COST OF TREATMENT SO WITH THIS INCREASED AMOUNT WE WOULD SUGGEST LIFTING THE CAP -- ALTOGETHER -- AND TO LET THE THE PATIENTS A CREW FUNDS IN THOSE ACCOUNTS -- AND BE USE FOR RE ENTRY PURPOSES. OTHERWISE SAY IF YOU LEAVE THE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS -- NOT MUCH BENEFIT THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE HAPPENING -- FOR THE THE WORKERS ALSO -- THIRD POINT IS THERE IS A GROUP OF I THINK -- LITTLE OVER A AYE LITTLE UNDER A HUNDRED WORKERS THAT HAVE BEEN RECEIVING -- THIS THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE AND WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS BE GRANDFATHERED IN AND NOT HAVE THE REDUCTION IF THE COURSE IS TO GO TO THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE. OKAY THANK YOU. SO MAYBE IT'S DOES. ACTUALLY FIRST OF ALL THE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ISN'T I MEAN. I REALIZE THAT THERE THESE PATIENTS ARE THERE TO IT BUT THIS IS IS THERE A REASON WE CAPPED OFF AT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS I REALIZE THIS IS AN OLDER POLICY. YEAH THERE'S AN OLDER POLICY I CAN KNOW WHAT THE WHAT THE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR CAP PURPOSE SENSE IN YEAH SO I MEAN IT PROBABLY SOME IDEA IN THE PAST THAT SOMEONE SAID WELL SINCE HERE WE'RE PAYING FOR ALL THIS STUFF FOR YOU ORDERS AGO RECLAIM IT THAT THAT THAT. DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME AND I MEAN FOR THESE PATIENTS I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT FOR ME AS AS THAT FIVE HUNDRED CAP A IT DOING IN THE NINETEEN AND PARTS I DON'T HAVE THE CALCULATION FIND ME BUT THE NUMBER OF HOURS THAT OUR PATIENTS WORK. IS -- IS. AT THE MOST ABOUT FIFTY HOURS PER MONTH AND SO THE THE CALCULATION OF THAT IS STILL-UNDERNEATH THAT FIVE HUNDRED CAP FOR THE MONTHLY. SOME FOR A MONTHLY. FIVE HUNDRED PER MONTH THERE'S A FIVE HUNDRED PERIOD. YEAH IT'S FIVE HUNDRED AT THE CITY SWEET BUT IT WOULD BE NICE. BY MONTH SO ANYTIME ON ACCOUNT EXCEEDS. FIVE HUNDRED THE PATIENTS NOTIFIED. WE WILL BE SWEEPING YOUR ACCOUNT. AND THEN TO LIVE SO EACH MONTH THEY CAN ONLY MAKE FIVE HUNDRED BUT THEY COULD CALCULATE FIVE HUNDRED EACH MONTH SO I MEAN IT'S UP TO FIVE HUNDRED SO YOU GET A FIVE HUNDRED A THOUSAND THOUSAND FIVE OR RIGHT BUT IT'S NOT BASED ON EARNED. YOU CAN RECEIVE MONEY IN OTHER WAYS. MEMBERS COULD FAMILY MEMBERS RELATIVE RIGHT HANDS COULD SEND MONEY AND SO ANYTIME YOU'RE THRESHOLD GOES BEYOND. FIVE HUNDRED THERE'S ATTEMPT TO SWEEP. WHY ARE WE DOING THAT? COST OF TREATMENT THAT SMILE. IT'S IN THE STANDING OUT. MAYBE IT WELL. IS THAT A COMMENTS FROM FINANCE YES NO IS I I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT WORDS BUT IT IT'S BASED ON CONVERSATION IS MY UNDERSTANDING THOUGH MANY OF THE TIMES THESE PATIENTS ARE SPENDING THEIR MONEY -- ADDED YOU KNOW CANTEEN THERE'S FOOD THERE'S FOOD VENDORS THAT THEY COULD SPEND THEIR MONEY ON SO. I MEAN THIS IS A THAT'S THEIR DECISION RIGHT AT WHETHER THEY WANT HI BUT I I SO I REALIZE THAT. WE HAVE THIS TO MY TO MY MIND A LITTLE ANTIQUATED. OF RIGHT I MEAN. AND AND THEN. I I I I I WOULD SUGGESTS LIVING IN A REALIZE IS NOT PART OF THE PROPOSAL'S BEEN SITTING THERE BUT IN MY MIND WHILE WE JUST GET RID OF THAT I AM NOT SURE WHY WE HAVE IT'S IT'S SENS WRONG MESSAGE TO PEOPLE RIGHT I MEAN REALLY IF THEY WANT. TO SPEND THEIR MONEY AND NOT HAVE ANYBODY THAT'S THAT'S FINE IF THEY WANT TO SAVE MONEY AND BUILD UP SOMETHING FOR WHATEVER PURPOSE THEY WANNA BUILD IT UP FOR I'M NOT SURE WHY WE'RE DISCOURAGING THAT BY SAYING THAT. HIS YOU SEE MORE IN FIVE HUNDRED WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE MONEY FROM YOU THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF MESSAGE YOU WANT TO SEND TO PEOPLE. SO WHY NOT JUST GET RID OF IT AND LESS THAN JUST AS OF DOLLARS OF FEDERAL REASON FOR HAVE IT WHY SHOULD THE STATE BE DOING THAT. WE COULD TAKE A LOOK AT IT I DID WANT TO SHARE THE ONE KNOWS. I WAS TOURING AT METRO AND I HAPPEN TO COME ACROSS A A PAINTER PATIENT WORKER. EARNING A DECENT AMOUNT MAYBE A COUPLE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH BUT HE WAS AWARE OF THE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR THRESHOLD. SO ON PURPOSE EVERY TIME HE EARNED HIS PAY HE PUT THE REQUEST IN. I'M GONNA SEND MY MONEY OUT AND HE'S SENDING IT. INTENTIONALLY TO MOM BECAUSE HIS HIS -- GRAND DREAM IS I'M GOING AT ONCE I GET OUT I'M GONNA HAVE A POT OF MONEY TO HELP SUSTAIN AFTERLIFE AT STATE HOSPITALS. SO THESE PATIENTS AS CHRISS MENTION BAIT THEY KNOW THE LAW OR THE RULE AND THEY ARE USING THAT MONEY OR FINDING IT BUYING CANTEEN. SO AVOID THE SWEEP YEAH SO WE BUT LET'S GET RID OF THE SUITE. I'VE REALIZED CAN WE GOING THROUGH THAT IS ANOTHER PROPOSAL GET RID THE SWEEP. WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT OKAY THANK YOU I AND AND AND AND PROBABLY COSTA SOME TIME AND MONEY OR EFFORT ON THE STATE'S PART TO DO THE SWEET ANYWAY SO WHY ARE WE SPENDING MONEY ON THAT SO. OKAY. ALL RIGHT WITH THAT ANYTHING ELSE OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE OF COURSE ALL THE ITEMS ARE ON CALL ON HOLD RIGHT NOW UNTIL. MAY REALIZE THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANKS VERY MUCH OKAY OUR CHAMPIONS TO COME IT CAME AT THE VERY END. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT A COUNTY COMMISSION [inaudible] THANK YOU. YOU GET THE AWARD FOR LIKE INSURANCE OF SITTING HERE WAITING I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG YOU ACTUALLY AT THE WAY THAT. AND SENATOR THIS REMINDS ME OF MY DAYS ON THE TRACK TEAM I WAS OFTEN LAST. BUT YOU ARE ALWAYS THERE RIGHT. THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU DID NOT. OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO WE HAVE TWO ITEMS FOR YOU SO WE'LL START OFF WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE WHICH IS THE INNOVATION INCUBATOR IMPLEMENTATION. YEAH PERFECT THAT THANKS VERY MUCH TOBY EWING ON BEHALF OF THE HOUSE SERVICES OVER SEND COUNTY COMMISSION. SO -- AS IDENTIFIED IN THE ANALYSIS. LAST YEAR THE BUDGET INCLUDED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO THE COMMISSION TO SUPPORT OUR WORK ON INNOVATION HALF OF THAT THIS YEAR HALF OF THAT NEXT YEAR. AS ORIGINALLY ENVISIONED WE INTENDED TO ESTABLISH A SORT OF A THIRD PARTY THAT WOULD FACILITATE THIS WORK IN IN TALKING WITH THE COUNTIES IN TALKING WITH PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THIS SPACE LOOKING AT MODELS AROUND THE COUNTRY AND ELSEWHERE. THE COMMISSION ELECTED TO DO THIS WORK IN HOUSE. PRIMARILY SO THAT WE CAN STRENGTHEN THE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN THE FACILITATION AROUND INNOVATION AND THE COMMISSION'S APPROVAL AUTHORITY WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMMISSION IS HELPING TO SUPPORT. THE DESIGN OF INNOVATIONS ON THE FRONT END IT CAN WE CAN STREAMLINE THE APPROVAL PROCESS ON THE BACKEND. AND SO WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT WORK AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES WERE SUPPORTING -- AT THE MOMENT FOR INNOVATIONS THAT WE INCOME AND IN PARTS WITH THE COUNTIES ANTICIPATE WILL FUNDAMENTALLY REDUCE THE INVOLVEMENT OF KNOW HOW CONSUMERS FOR THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WHICH WILL HAVE THE UP UPSTREAM. DOWNSTREAM IMPACTS OF REDUCING THE NUMBER OF FOLKS WERE RISK OF A FELONY INVOLVEMENT IN THE US AND COMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL -- DESIGNATION AND AND SO -- WORKING WITH FINANCE WE HAD PROPOSED TO HAVE SOME INTERNAL STAFFING TO STRENGTHEN THAT WORK INTO THE PROPOSAL IS FOR TWO POSITIONS FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. TO HELP MAKE THAT PROJECT WORK. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU ALL RIGHT LA ONLY COMMENTS FINANCE GOVERNMENTS OKAY WELL. CERTAINLY. GOOD TO BRING STUFF IN HOUSE RIGHT. EXCELLENT -- THAT'S GONE ISSUE NUMBER TWO COMMISSION BUDGET REQUESTS AND PROPOSALS FOR INVESTMENTS [inaudible] THOUGH THE THE THE QUESTION IS ASKING FOR THE NUMBER OF THINGS HERE BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FIRST THREE OKAY BECAUSE THEY COME AS A PACKAGE AND THERE'S THERE'S A FOURTH PEACE AND SO DURING THE TESTIMONY. AT OUR LAST HEARING WE TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THE COMMISSION'S WORK IN LOOKING AT DATA. AND SO WE HAVE TAX OF THE ANNOUNCES TALKS ABOUT IT'S ACTUALLY LIVE TODAY IT WENT LIVE A COUPLE -- A COUPLE WEEKS AGO -- CURRENTLY YOU CAN GO ON THE QUESTIONS WEBSITE AND AND GET A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH DOLLARS -- YOU CAN DO KEYWORD SEARCH AND DOWNLOAD INFORMATION ON ABOUT TWENTY ONE HUNDRED IMAGES A FUNDED PROGRAMS ALL ACROSS THE STATE AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY -- ONE OUTCOME WHICH IS LOOKING AT FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS. IN THE EXAMPLE OF FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS WERE FINDING A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF FOLKS AREN'T ARE DISCHARGING THIS IN ROLLING FROM THESE SERVICES BUT NOT MEETING GOALS. LOTS OF REASONS FOR THAT THE PEOPLE BEING SERVED BY FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS TEND TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT TO SERVE IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS. FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS WERE ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF JAIL OUT OF STATE HOSPITALS OFF THE STREETS AND OUT OF OUT OF ER'S. IN AND SO ONWE WANT TO CONTINUE THAT WORK AND DO IT AND IN A IN A WITH WITH A BROADER FOCUS. THE COMMISSION CURRENTLY THE LAW CURRENTLY STE TESTIFIES TO THE COMMISSION'S AUTHORITY IS OVER THE IMAGE TO SAY BUT ALSO THE CHILDREN SYSTEM OF CARE DOSS MCCARRON OLDER ADULTS SYSTEM OF CARE. OUR WORK HAS BEEN LIMITED TO THE IMAGES SAY DOLLARS AND IMAGES THEY PROGRAMS MOSTLY BECAUSE OF RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS. OUR ARGUMENT IS THAT TO CREATE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM WE NEED TO SEE ALL THE COMPONENTS OF THAT IMAGE ESSAYS ABOUT 25% OF THE MONEY. AND ARGUABLY ABOUT 25% OF THE SYSTEM. IT'S VERY USEFUL TO KNOW A LOT ABOUT ONE OF THE TIRES ON YOUR CAR IT'S MORE USEFUL TO KNOW IF ALL FOUR OF THEM ARE GOING TO HOLD UP WHEN YOU'RE TAKING THAT LONG TRIP ACROSS THE DESERT. AS PART OF THAT. AS THE COMMISSION IDENTIFIES CHALLENGES WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO OFFER STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES SO IN THE INSTANCE OF FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS WERE WORKING WITH ABOUT A DOZEN COUNTIES TO DESIGN A COLLABORATIVE INNOVATION PROJECT. THAT WOULD STRENGTHEN THOSE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS ARE PROPOSALS AROUND DATA ARE TO STRENGTHEN OUR ABILITY TO TELL THE LARGER STORY OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM DOLLARS SERVICES AND OUTCOMES. BUT AS WE DO THAT OUTCOMES WORK WE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THE INNOVATION DOLLARS THAT WERE AWARDED LAST YEAR AND MAKE THEM ON GOING. WE WE WANT TO SUPPORT THE ABILITY OF COUNTIES TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY THE REASON FOR THAT. IS WE AS INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES INVEST IN INNOVATIONS IN THEIR SUCCESSFUL THEY'RE OFTEN SEEN AS THE SANTA CLARA MIRACLE. AND WHAT WE WANT IS TO BRING TOGETHER GROUPS OF COUNTIES TO WORK TOGETHER INITIATIVE SHARED CONCERN PARTICULAR ISSUES OF STATEWIDE CONCERN. FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS ARE ABOUT AN EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL INVESTMENT UNDER THE STATE'S RULES. THE STATE HAS AN INTEREST IN STRENGTHENING THAT AND SO OUR PROPOSAL IS TO LEVERAGE THIS TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS TO STRENGTHEN HOW THE COUNTY SPEND A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF AND IF HAVE -- IMAGE TO SAY INNOVATION DOLLARS. RELATED TO THAT IS THE THIRD ITEM ON HERE OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. WE E ARE OF THE MIND THAT IN CALIFORNIA AND IN THE COUNTRY WE HAVE THE EXPERTISE THE AWARENESS THE CAPACITY. TO STRENGTHEN OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM BUT THAT CAPACITY ISN'T NECESSARILY IN A COUNTY OR IN ALL COUNTIES. AND SO THROUGH THE FACILITATION OF INNOVATION THE ADDITION OF OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND THERE'S A THIRD COMPONENT IT'S NOT IN FRONT OF YOU AT THE MOMENT. YEAH IT WAS ON THE AGENDA A COUPLE WEEKS AGO TO TREAT US DOLLARS AS INCENTIVE DOLLARS. THE IDEA IS WE WOULD DO THE DATA ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED CHALLENGES AND BE ABLE TO INVEST INCENTIVE DOLLARS T. A. AND FACILITATION TO STRENGTHEN THOSE PROGRAMS THAT NEED SOME WORK. SO THAT SO THE THE THE DATA WORKED INNOVATION SUPPORT THE TA AND THE TRIAGE MONEY WE TALKED ABOUT IT A PRIOR HEARING ARE PART OF THAT STRATEGY. SEPARATE FROM THAT IS A REQUEST TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO STRENGTHEN ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF HAVING TO REFUGEES. WE RECEIVED FUNDING LAST YEAR -- WE HAVE AWARDED THAT FOR THOSE FUNDS WERE AWARDED LAST WEEK WERE IN THAT APPEAL PROCESS AT THE MOMENT. BUT AS PART OF THIS WORK WE JUST HEARD OVERWHELMING STORIES OF THE STRUGGLES THAT IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES ARE FACING IN CALIFORNIA WITH REGARD TO MENTAL HEALTH AND SO THE COMMISSION IS ASKING TO AUGMENT THAT SUPPORT. SO THAT WE CAN DO MORE WITH THOSE DOLLARS. THE LAST ITEM IN THE ANALYSIS IS THE M. P. E. I REQUEST UNDER SB -- TEN FOR THE COMMISSION IS DIRECTED TO ESTABLISH A FRAMEWORK AND STRATEGY AND AN EVALUATION COMPONENT FOR P. E. I.. SIMILAR TO THE WORK WE'VE DONE WITH INNOVATION TO TRY TO BRING FOCUS TO THAT COMPONENT OF THE ACT. THIS IS REALLYIMPORTANT WORK IT IS PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT WORK BECAUSE OUR ABILITY TO BE EFFECTIVE THROUGH PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION CAN REDUCE OUR LONG TERM COSTS. AND JUST AS A REMINDER UNDER P. I'D THE LANGUAGE IS ABOUT REDUCING HOMELESSNESS UNEMPLOYMENT CHILD WELFARE INVOLVEMENT SCHOOL FAILURE SUICIDE AND OTHER ISSUES AND SO WE SEE PROFOUND IMPLICATIONS IF WE CAN SUPPORT THE WORK OF THE COUNTIES. REALLY FOCUS THE P. E. I. STRATEGY TO STRENGTHEN OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND MOVE MORE TOWARDS A UP A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH OF THE PUBLIC. RATHER THAN SIMPLY THE DELIVERY OF MENTAL HEALTH THROUGH PUBLIC DOLLARS AND SO WE'RE ASKING FOR FOR POSITIONS TO MAKE THAT WORK MORE STRATEGIC AND FOCUSED. TRY TO BE QUICK I WASN'T A SPRINTER BUT I DID MY BEST TONIGHT. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU COMMENTS REALLY EL [inaudible] FINANCE [inaudible] RIGHT. OKAY THANK YOU -- THE APPRECIATE THE STRATEGY -- PUBLIC COMMENT ON EITHER ITEM FOR THE SO AGE OKAY SAYING NO PUBLIC COMMENT. THE THE THIS PROPOSALS AND REALLY APPRECIATE THE ACTUALLY -- THE COMMISSION AND I SHE TAKING ON IT'S A SAID -- I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A LITTLE FRUSTRATED WE LOOK AT MENTAL HEALTH WE OFTEN LOOK AT THE SPOT THAT PINE WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT ALL OF THEM TOGETHER SO I APPRECIATE THE COMMISSION TRYING. TO DO THAT WITH THAT YOUR DATA ELEMENTS AS WELL AS OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TERMS OF PROMOTING INNOVATION THAT BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER COLLABORATE THANK YOU. THIS ARE PUBLIC COMMENT SO WHERE WAS SICK OR OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO WE DO HAVE A STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL THANK YOU SORRY I MISSED MY NOTES RIGHT WHEN TO COME UP HERE -- THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK. AND SELL YES I AM VERY WELL AWARE THAT I'M LAST. CORRECT. I'M HERE IN SAVAGE AND WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK SEE. TEN AND WE'RE HERE AND BACK IN MARCH WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SOME DATA AND COMMENTS ON MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITIES BEFORE YOUR OTHER COMMITTEE AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS WE REALLY WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE TIME IS WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DATE ON MENTAL HEALTH. DISPARITIES WE CONTINUE TO SEE REALLY FAST AND ALSO PERSISTENT DISPARITIES WE'RE NOT SEEING THINGS IMPROVE OVER TIME. AND SO WE REALLY WANT TO THINK AB WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON HOW DO WE PURSUE A REALLY FOCUSED STRATEGY AROUND MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITIES BECAUSE WE NEED TO SEE THEM GET BETTER. AND O WE FEEL LIKE THERE'S REALLY TWO PARTS TO THIS ONE IS AROUND ACCOUNTABILITY AND ONE IS AROUND INVESTMENT. AND AND SO THE AND THE ACCOUNTABILITY PIECE WE HAVE A BILL THAT'S MOVING THROUGH THE PROCESS. I'M ITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING BUT THIS IS THE INVESTMENT PART BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT. WE CAN HOLD COUNTIES TO A STANDARD WE CAN SAY THESE ARE THE BENCHMARK IN AND THAT IS OUR BIG HOLE BUT WE ALSO NEED TO GIVE THEM THE TOOLS IN THE ASSISTANCE. TO DO BETTER AND SO AND OUR PROPOSAL IS FOR FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS -- ON GOING FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT -- ADMIN FIND IT FOR BASICALLY I'M FOUR COMPONENTS OF A STRATEGY AND REDUCING MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITIES SO BETTER DATA COLLECTION THE DATA WE PRESENTED TO YOU WITH VERY LIMITED BUT THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT SO BETTER DATA COLLECTION SO THAT COUNTIES AND AND OTHER ENTITIES CAN MAKE INFORMED PROGRAMMATIC DECISIONS. I'M TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WE'VE TALKED TO PROBABLY HALF THE COUNTIES IN THE FALL SAID WE KNOW WE HAVE A PROBLEM WE WANTED YOU BETTER WE NEED SOME HELP -- SO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE VERY MUCH ALIGNED WITH THE AC AND WHAT MISTER EWING IS PROPOSING AND THEN A COMPONENT AROUND INNOVATION TO HELP PEOPLE TRY OUT NEW THINGS THAT MIGHT WORK BETTER THAN WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY RIGHT TRYING OUT NEW THINGS OF VALUE EIGHT THEM AND THEN SEE WHAT WE CAN. SCALE -- AND INCORPORATE INTO OUR SYSTEM AND THEN THE FINAL PIECE AROUND INCENTIVES SO HOW DO WE BOTH TELL COUNTIES THEY NEED TO MEET SOME BENCHMARKS THE NEED TO REDUCE DISPARITIES BUT THEN REWARD THEM FOR DOING SO -- SO THAT'S OUR PROPOSAL IN A NUTSHELL AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I'M AND I DO KNOW WILL BE SITTING DOWN WITH THE AC AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LATER THIS WEEK ON IT. OKAY -- SO ANY COMMENTS FROM THE COMMISSION WE WE'VE TALKED WITH SAID WITH C. PAN AND AND THEIR PARTNERS IN TERMS OF THIS PROPOSAL AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S VERY MUCH ALIGNED. WITH A STRATEGY THAT WE'RE PROPOSING I IN I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW THE COMMISSION HAS NOT FORMALLY ENGAGED IN THIS IT'S VERY CONSISTENT WITH THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING WE VERY MUCH ARE CONCERNED ABOUT DISPARITIES WE'VE DONE A LITTLE BIT OF WORK TO TRY TO MAP DISPARITIES USING THAT MEDICAL CLAIMS DATA. AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE REINFORCING DISPARITIES TO ACCESS KINDS OF STRATEGIES -- WE'VE REQUIRED UNDER OUR P. I REGULATIONS THAT THAT PROVIDERS REPORT OUT RACIAL AND ETHNIC AND OTHER DETAILED DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SO WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND ACTUALLY WHO IS RECEIVING CARE NOT JUST WHO WE PLANS ARE BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY SERVED. PART OF THE CHALLENGES THOSE THOSE THAT REGULATORY RULE ONLY APPLIES TO P. I. INNOVATION BECAUSE THAT'S THE LIMIT OF THE COMMISSION'S AUTHORITY. SO I I THINK THIS PROPOSAL IS IT YOU KNOW SPOT ON VERY CONSISTENT WITH THE WITH BOTH OUR STRATEGY AS WELL AS OUR AREAS OF CONCERN. I THINK YOU KNOW WE WOULD WANT TO THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE AND STAKEHOLDER PROPOSAL INTERACT THEY CERTAINLY DON'T CONFLICT -- INLET BUT BUT AS YOU KNOW OUR CONCERN WOULD BE IF YOU'RE IN A POSITION OF DOING ONE OR THE OTHER HOW WOULD YOU SORT OF MANAGE THAT. AND THAT'S A QUESTION OF ARE THERE ADEQUATE RESOURCES AND WITH EVERY SUPPORT AND AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S WHERE THE CONVERSATION NEEDS TO MOVE FORWARD TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE MIGHT DO THAT OKAY. RIGHT AWAY -- COMMENTS. FINANCE OKAY SO I GUESS WE'LL ONE THE QUESTIONS I'VE SEEN BOTH THE THE FOR THE PROPOSALS IS THAT. SIR WAY THEY CAN KIND OF COME TOGETHER -- BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN HAVE A STAND ALONE PROPOSAL LOOKING DISPARITIES BUT WE NOW HAVE THIS DATA COLLECTION ABOUT IT IS THAT I WELL CAN WE INCORPORATE. INTO THAT SO THAT WE'RE SO WE DON'T HAVE TWO DIFFERENT SYSTEMS RUNNING. IN PARALLEL AND AND IN MANY WAYS THE ONLY. ONE THE THAT THAT'S VERY EASY TO BE ONE OF YOUR DATA ELEMENTS IN THE LARGER ONES YOU CAN FOLD THAT IN BUT LOW AND AND DO YOU HAVE CASH TO GET MORE OUT OF IT THAT WAY SO IS THAT SOMETHING. YOU'RE. LOOKING AT TALKING ABOUT YEAH I MEAN I THINK LIKE MOST HEARING SAID THAT'S THE CONVERSATION THAT WE NEED TO HAVE NEXT THEY THINK -- WE WOULD VERY MUCH AGREED DISPARITIES SHOULD BE A PIECE OF THINGS I THINK WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S REALLY A FOCUS OF ANY STRATEGY BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE SEEN. YOU KNOW WE'VE INVESTED. TWO BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT RIGHT AND BECAUSE DISPARITIES HASN'T BEEN AN EXPLICIT FOCUS OF MOST OF THE WORK WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT REDUCING DISPARITIES IN SOME CASES FOR MAKING THEM. WORSE I THINK WE CAN DEFINITELY GO IN THAT DIRECTION WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS BOTH YEAH YEAH YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT YOU BUT YOU MAYES. SEE IS RABBI THE DATA SIDE MAKES SENSE TO INTEGRATE MAY THINK ABOUT. HAVING GAIL THE A COMPONENT OF WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT TECHNICAL SYSTEMS AND SO FORTH THAT HAS MORE OF A DE CHARETTE SPERRY'S HAS A STAND ALONE EL HAS IS PARTICULAR FOCUS -- FOR CERTAIN PORTION OF THAT -- SO THAT -- DOESN'T GET LOST IN THE SHUFFLE KIND OF THING BUT ALL RIGHT WELL LIKE CHURCH THOSE CONVERSATIONS VITAL ALSO DON'T WANT TO HAVE LIKE. STILL DEEPLY CATION AND AN EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES SO. WE AGREE COMPLETELY AND I AND I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW CONCEPTUALLY VALUE WISE WE'RE EXACTLY ON THE SAME PAGE THE QUESTION IS WHAT'S THE PATH TO GET THERE IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE BUDGET. SO THAT WEEK SO SO THAT IT'S NOT TOO DISPARATE SYSTEMS. THERE WERE ALSO NOT SORT OF YOU KNOW TRUST US WE WILL TAKE THIS ON RIDE INSIDE SO I DO THINK IN IN A CONVERSATION WITH THE C. PEN AND AND BUT IT CHAIR TAKING ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE -- WE WE WANT TO FIND THAT PATH AS WELL WE JUST HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET THEN I GUESS THE OTHER PIECE RECOGNIZING THE LIMITATIONS OF THE COMMISSION TO IN TERMS OF DATA -- OR YOU ALSO LOOKING AT AND AGAIN I DON'T KNOW WHY. BECAUSE SUMMER TEAMS BILLS OVER AND ASSEMBLY SEVEN CHANCE TO LOOK AT IT. IN TERMS OF DATA COLLECTION THAT WE REALLY CAN'T MEDI CAL THE MENTAL HEALTH -- DATA COLLECTION BECAUSE THEY CAN'T CUTS I MEAN. THE CELL TO BE SURE THAT -- WE GET THE DATA YEAH THE AND DEFINITELY I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE BILL AND WOULD HOPE TO BRING INTO THIS TOO I THINK. YOU KNOW WE'VE LOOKED AT A LOT OF THE MEDICAL DATA THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET THROUGH PREVIOUS LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS. IN OUR BILL WE ALSO REQUIRE -- THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN THE OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY AND THE SURGEON GENERAL TO WORK TOGETHER ON THIS ARE TRYING TO BRING FROM AN AGENCY LEVEL TO ALL OF THE DATA INTO ONE PLACE I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY ARTICLE. OKAY ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS. SEEING NONE I WANT THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS. AND REALLY APPRECIATE UP WILL BE HOLDING THOSE ITEMS OPEN. BECAUSE UNTIL AFTER A REVISED THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. OKAY WELL AND BELIEVE THIS CONCLUDES THE AGENDA OF THE SENATE BUDGET FISCAL REVIEW SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER -- THREE AND WITH THAT WE ARE ADJOURNED THANK YOU
