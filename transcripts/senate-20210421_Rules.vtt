WITH SECOND PART YOUR QUESTION

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.883
FIRST AND THAT IS I AGREE THAT

00:19:10.949 --> 00:19:12.985
IT SHOULD BE. THAT THE ATTORNEY

00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:14.953
GENERAL'S BURDEN RESPONSIBILITY

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:15.721
TO DEMONSTRATE WHY INVESTMENTS

00:19:15.787 --> 00:19:17.856
WILL ADD VALUE. AND THAT IF

00:19:17.923 --> 00:19:18.857
MONIES GIVEN BY THE LEGISLATION

00:19:18.924 --> 00:19:21.527

OF BEING ATTORNEY GENERAL AND

00:19:27.533 --> 00:19:29.401
ASK FOR MORE MONEY. AND I THINK

00:19:29.468 --> 00:19:31.503
WE CAN AGREE ON PATHWAYS ABOUT

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:32.671
HOW TO GET THERE YOUR IDEA I

00:19:32.738 --> 00:19:33.906
THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT IDEA TO

00:19:33.972 --> 00:19:35.073
CONSIDER FOR HOW TO FILL THE

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.508
VACANCY RATE THERE'S PROBABLY

00:19:36.575 --> 00:19:38.277
OTHER IDEAS OUT THERE AS WELL-

00:19:38.343 --> 00:19:39.444
I DO THINK THAT ONE OF THE

00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:43.315
CHALLENGES HAS BEEN- YOU KNOW

00:19:43.382 --> 00:19:44.149

RETENTION. AND ATTRACTION CHILD

00:19:45.918 --> 00:19:47.553
FOR SOME TIME AND IT A LITTLE

00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:50.022
BIT OF IT IS- INSTITUTIONAL. IN

00:19:50.088 --> 00:19:52.591
TERMS OF BEING COMPETITIVE. SO

00:19:52.658 --> 00:19:53.759
YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA NEED TO

00:19:53.825 --> 00:19:54.560
ATTRACT FOLKS TO COME INTO

00:19:54.626 --> 00:19:55.827
THOSE POSITIONS AND MAKE SURE

00:19:55.894 --> 00:19:56.962
THAT YOU CAN'T JUST BE ANYBODY

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.963
HAS TO BE THE RIGHT PERSON WITH

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:58.997
THE RIGHT SKILL SET WITH THE

00:19:59.064 --> 00:20:00.098
RIGHT TALENTS TO GET THIS JOB

00:20:00.165 --> 00:20:02.834

00:20:02.901 --> 00:20:04.937
THOROUGHLY SO. I'M OPEN TO

00:20:05.003 --> 00:20:08.707
IDEAS AND OTHERS- BUT- THANK

00:20:08.774 --> 00:20:09.241
YOU FOR AGREEING THAT THE

00:20:09.308 --> 00:20:10.242
VACANCY RATE IS A CHALLENGE.

00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:12.110
THERE IS CONCERN FROM OUR

00:20:12.177 --> 00:20:13.912
SECOND AMENDMENT ADVOCATES ALSO

00:20:13.979 --> 00:20:15.280
THAT A LOT OF THE FOLKS IN THE

00:20:15.347 --> 00:20:17.049
LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN ON GUN

00:20:17.115 --> 00:20:18.917
CONTROL NOT RECOGNIZING THAT

00:20:18.984 --> 00:20:21.587
MANY MOST PEOPLE WITHHOLD FONG

00:20:21.653 --> 00:20:24.990
MAYBE THE 55% A MEASURE THE 2%

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:26.158
ON A BELL CURVE ARE THE ONES

00:20:26.224 --> 00:20:27.693
WHO ARE THE WORST ONES WE HAVE

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:29.461
TO BE VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

00:20:29.528 --> 00:20:30.228
BECAUSE THEY ARE GETTING THEIR

00:20:30.295 --> 00:20:32.698
GUNS. ILLEGALLY ANYWAY AND THEN

00:20:32.764 --> 00:20:34.399

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.836
HEALTH ISSUES HUGE PROBLEM SO

THOSE ISSUES BUT IT WOULD BE

00:20:56.355 --> 00:20:57.589

WHO RESPONSIBLY OWN GUNS FOR

00:21:20.746 --> 00:21:22.948
SELF DEFENSE OR FOR SPORTING OR

00:21:23.015 --> 00:21:25.484
HUNTING- BLOOD THAT IS NOT MY

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:27.753
FOCUS MY FOCUS IS ON THOSE WHO

WILL DO HARM- DOWN THOSE WHO

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:32.491
HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

00:21:32.557 --> 00:21:33.925
MASS SHOOTINGS THAT HAVE TAKEN

00:21:33.992 --> 00:21:34.359

ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND MY

EARLIER DESCRIBED AS AMERICA'S

00:21:42.534 --> 00:21:45.337
DISEASE- THEN REDUCING THE

00:21:45.404 --> 00:21:47.939
DEATH AND THE HURT THAT COMES

00:21:48.006 --> 00:21:50.108
FROM FROM GUN VIOLENCE SENATE

THANK I ABSOLUTELY THINK. THAT

00:21:52.678 --> 00:21:54.146
YOU CAN DO BOTH AND I DON'T

00:21:54.212 --> 00:21:56.982
THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO SAY

00:21:57.049 --> 00:21:57.983
THAT SOMEONE WHO SUPPORTIVE OF

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:02.320
COMMONSENSE- TEN FIFTY POLICIES

00:22:02.387 --> 00:22:04.089
IS NECESSARILY BECAUSE OF THAT.

00:22:04.156 --> 00:22:05.791
AGAINST THE SECOND AMENDMENT

00:22:05.857 --> 00:22:08.226
NOT TRUE- YOU CAN HONOR THE

00:22:08.293 --> 00:22:09.661
SECOND AMENDMENT AS I DO AND

00:22:09.728 --> 00:22:10.162
ALSO BE IN SUPPORT OF

00:22:10.228 --> 00:22:12.197
COMMONSENSE. GUN SAFETY

00:22:12.264 --> 00:22:13.965
POLICIES I DON'T DISAGREE WITH

00:22:14.032 --> 00:22:15.901
THAT LET ME MOVE TO ANOTHER

00:22:15.967 --> 00:22:17.302
AREA THAT'S OF PARTICULAR

00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:19.104
CONCERN TO MIND TO ME AND I'VE

00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:20.539
BEEN INVOLVED JOBS SINCE I'VE

00:22:20.605 --> 00:22:22.541
BEEN THE LEGISLATURE WITH. THE

00:22:22.607 --> 00:22:24.743
INCREASE IN THE OPIOID USE AND-

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.845
THE ILLEGAL DRUG TRADE I'VE HAD

00:22:26.912 --> 00:22:29.314
A BILL- BEFORE THE- LEGISLATURE

00:22:29.381 --> 00:22:32.851
A COUPLE OF SESSIONS ON FAT NOW

00:22:32.918 --> 00:22:34.653
TO HAVE THE EDGE BASICALLY-

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.254
IT'S OFFENSE ENHANCEMENT WHICH

00:22:36.321 --> 00:22:37.923
IS NOT POPULAR I LOOK AT IT IN

00:22:37.989 --> 00:22:39.391
A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THAT IS

00:22:39.458 --> 00:22:41.793
JUST ADDING FENTANYL TO. TO

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:47.733
DRUGS OF WHICH IS COOKING.

00:22:47.799 --> 00:22:50.235
COCAINE AND TEARAWAY. WHICH ARE

00:22:50.302 --> 00:22:52.204
SCHEDULED TO NOT HER ONE IS ONE

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:53.472
COCAINE A SCHEDULE TO BUT DO

00:22:53.538 --> 00:22:54.439
HAVE SEVERE PENALTY FOR LOW

00:22:54.506 --> 00:22:55.974
QUANTITIES THAT ARE IMPORTED

00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:58.076
AND- PRODUCED AND IMPORTED ON

00:22:58.143 --> 00:23:00.645
BY. LET'S SAY THE CURTAILS.

00:23:00.712 --> 00:23:02.514
HANDLE WOULD YOU BE SUPPORTIVE

00:23:02.581 --> 00:23:04.816
OF- THE HOBBIT NOW BEING LISTED

00:23:04.883 --> 00:23:06.785
ON THE SCHEDULE ONE DRUGS WRITE

00:23:06.852 --> 00:23:08.053
A LETTER OF SUPPORT ON THAT

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.688
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S ONE OF

00:23:09.755 --> 00:23:11.957
THE AREAS THAT WE HAVE TO. DEAL

00:23:12.023 --> 00:23:13.325
COORDINATE WITH A AT THE

00:23:13.391 --> 00:23:15.160
FEDERAL LEVEL WHEN WE GET THERE

00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:16.661
WE'LL PROBABLY HAVE A MORE.

00:23:16.728 --> 00:23:18.730
UNITED NOW NATIONAL A DEFENSE

00:23:18.797 --> 00:23:20.565
AGAINST THIS POISON AND IT IS

00:23:20.632 --> 00:23:22.234
ALWAYS AN ISSUE I KNOW YOU'RE

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.535
PROBABLY VERY AWARE OF HOW

00:23:23.602 --> 00:23:25.871
LEGAL IT IS. BUT IT'S SOMETHING

00:23:25.937 --> 00:23:26.805
THAT I THINK IS EXTREMELY

00:23:26.872 --> 00:23:28.640
IMPORTANT TO AS WE SEE OUR

00:23:28.707 --> 00:23:30.108
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING

00:23:30.175 --> 00:23:32.377
DECEIVED- THAT UNFORTUNATELY

00:23:32.444 --> 00:23:33.979
THERE IN. TO THE DRUG CULTURE

00:23:34.045 --> 00:23:36.615
AND GETTING HIGH. ON OPIATES

00:23:36.681 --> 00:23:38.150
NOT UNDERSTANDING THAT THOSE

00:23:38.216 --> 00:23:39.818
ARE NOW FENTANYL PILLS THAT

00:23:39.885 --> 00:23:42.053
KILL THEM PRETTY INSTANTLY NOW

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.688
TO MINNESOTA RESTORATION SHUTS

00:23:43.755 --> 00:23:50.629
DOWN IF YOU HAVE FOUND NOW. SO.

00:23:50.695 --> 00:23:52.397
GIVE ME SOME THOUGHTS ON THAT.

SOME OF THE EXPERTS AT

UNIQUE PART ABOUT MINE PATH TO

IT DOESN'T COME BACK TO US- TO

00:26:10.335 --> 00:26:11.569

00:26:37.529 --> 00:26:38.596
IT COULD BE VERY POSITIVE

00:26:38.663 --> 00:26:39.831

WHAT STEPS WILL YOU TAKE TO

00:27:00.018 --> 00:27:01.519
ENSURE THE PROCESS IS REALLY

00:27:01.586 --> 00:27:03.989
NOT PARTISAN. AND IT'S SIMPLE

00:27:04.055 --> 00:27:05.390

UNDERSTAND AFTER THEY VOTED ON

00:27:17.135 --> 00:27:18.703
IT WHAT IT REALLY MEANT THE

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:20.739
MOST TO THE LATEST ONE IS PROP

AMERICAN COMMUNITY IN LA. IS

OUR FOLKS WHO ARE IN THE

00:43:48.826 --> 00:43:50.561
CRIMINAL JUSTICE WORLD I JUST

00:43:50.627 --> 00:43:52.129
HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS I KNOW WE

00:43:52.196 --> 00:43:55.432
HAD A REALLY FUN- DISCUSSION

00:43:55.499 --> 00:43:57.201
EARLIER THIS WEEK. AND I THINK

00:43:57.267 --> 00:43:58.802
I MENTIONED THAT I WAS GOING TO

00:43:58.869 --> 00:44:00.304
ASK YOU ABOUT. SOME OF THESE

00:44:00.371 --> 00:44:02.940
ISSUES THE FIRST ONE. IS- ABOUT

00:44:03.007 --> 00:44:05.542
HEALTHCARE. AND SPECIFICALLY

00:44:05.609 --> 00:44:07.211
THAT MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS

00:44:07.277 --> 00:44:09.880
OF HOSPITALS. A WE KNOW THAT

00:44:09.947 --> 00:44:11.949
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL YOU KNOW

00:44:12.016 --> 00:44:14.418
FILED AN ANTITRUST LAWSUIT

00:44:14.485 --> 00:44:15.953
THERE WAS A SETTLEMENT IN THE

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:17.821
OFFICE OF THE AG FILED IN

00:44:17.888 --> 00:44:19.456
OPPOSITION TO THE DELAY OF THE

00:44:19.523 --> 00:44:20.124
SETTLEMENT I THINK JUST

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:21.925
RECENTLY. THERE WAS A PARTIAL

00:44:21.992 --> 00:44:24.928
SUMMARY JUDGMENT- AND I BELIEVE

00:44:24.995 --> 00:44:26.263
THAT THERE'S A TRIAL SET FOR

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:27.498
LATER THIS YEAR THIS IS

00:44:27.564 --> 00:44:29.900
SPECIFIC TO SUTTER HEALTH BUT-

00:44:29.967 --> 00:44:31.135
I KNOW THAT THE STATE IS REALLY

00:44:31.201 --> 00:44:33.771
ARGUED THAT- CONSOLIDATION IS

00:44:33.837 --> 00:44:36.807
ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS. FOR

00:44:36.874 --> 00:44:40.177
THE EXPENSIVE COST OF HEALTH-

00:44:40.244 --> 00:44:42.613
AND HOW DO WE REALLY MANAGE

00:44:42.679 --> 00:44:44.314
THAT AND I BELIEVE THE ARGUMENT

00:44:44.381 --> 00:44:45.849
IS THE LARGER THE SHARE OF THE

00:44:45.916 --> 00:44:47.184
MARKET THAT A HOSPITAL

00:44:47.251 --> 00:44:49.219
CONTROLS. THAT ALSO MEANS ARE

00:44:49.286 --> 00:44:51.688
ABLE TO DECIDE DECIDE COST TO

00:44:51.755 --> 00:44:54.458

SENATOR SKINNER ACTUALLY PASSED

EVENTUALLY THEY DID BUT TO A%

00:48:21.832 --> 00:48:23.700
SMALLER DEGREE THEN I THINK

00:48:23.767 --> 00:48:25.502

NOT ACCEPTABLE THAT YOU WANT

01:03:26.502 --> 01:03:27.103

01:04:15.651 --> 01:04:16.619

EVERY DROP OF WATER THAT COMES

WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THE

01:06:30.086 --> 01:06:30.686
INCREDIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:06:30.753 --> 01:06:32.922

ILLEGAL MARIJUANA GROWS. WHAT'S

01:06:35.057 --> 01:06:36.125
YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS ON A

01:06:36.192 --> 01:06:37.960
DRESSING THESE ILLEGAL GROWS ON

01:06:38.027 --> 01:06:38.928
STATE LANDS AND PRIVATE LANDS

01:06:38.994 --> 01:06:43.265
THAT ARE- AFFECTING OUR WATER.

01:06:43.332 --> 01:06:44.633
I BELIEVE AND HOPE THAT MY

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:45.601
RECORDS BEEN CLEAR ON THIS THAT.

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:50.840
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:06:50.906 --> 01:06:53.109
CALIFORNIA'S CANNABIS INDUSTRY

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:55.311
IS IN THE REGULATED MARKET

01:06:55.378 --> 01:06:56.979
PLACE THE LEGAL MARKET PLACE

01:06:57.046 --> 01:06:59.348
NOT IN THE ILLICIT MARKET PLACE

01:06:59.415 --> 01:07:00.549
RIGHT NOW WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT

01:07:00.616 --> 01:07:02.551
I REALIZE THAT I PAVE I'VE

01:07:02.618 --> 01:07:04.353
HEARD FROM SOME NUMBER LACKEY

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:07.256
ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY ABOUT THE

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:08.624
BILLY DEEP CONCERNS THAT THEY

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:09.191
HAVE BUT I THINK THIS IS AN

01:07:09.258 --> 01:07:11.327
AREA OF AGAIN OF BIPARTISAN

01:07:11.394 --> 01:07:12.628
CONCERN AND POTENTIAL

01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:15.231
BIPARTISAN SOLUTION- WE NEED TO

01:07:15.297 --> 01:07:18.033
ADDRESS IT. IT'S NOT OKAY FROM

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:21.904
IT UNDERMINES THE- OPERATORS IN

01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:22.972
THE REGULATED MARKET PLACE FOR

01:07:23.038 --> 01:07:24.907
FOLLOWING ALL THE RULES PAYING

01:07:24.974 --> 01:07:26.675
THEIR TAXES STRUGGLING AS

01:07:26.742 --> 01:07:29.044
BUSINESSES TO SUCCEED AND

01:07:29.111 --> 01:07:30.012
THEY'RE GETTING UNDER CUT BY

01:07:30.079 --> 01:07:31.614
THOSE ILLICIT MARKETPLACES WHO

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:36.085
ARE WHO ARE FLOUTING THE LAW.

01:07:36.152 --> 01:07:38.120
WHAT WE DO TO- TO ADDRESS THAT-

01:07:38.187 --> 01:07:38.888
THERE MIGHT BE SOME DIFFERENCES

01:07:38.954 --> 01:07:40.556
OF OPINION. I DON'T WANT TO GO

01:07:40.623 --> 01:07:44.627
BACK TO A WAR ON DRUGS- I DON'T

01:07:44.693 --> 01:07:47.630
WANT TO BE- THAT GO TOO FAR

01:07:47.696 --> 01:07:48.831
WITH. IT WITH OVER

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:50.766
CRIMINALIZATION BUT I DO WANT

01:07:50.833 --> 01:07:52.201
THE OPERATORS TO NOT BE

01:07:52.268 --> 01:07:53.302
OPERATING IN THE ILLICIT MARKET

01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:54.937
PLACE AND TO BE OPERATING IN

01:07:55.004 --> 01:07:56.572
THE REGULAR MARKET PLACE. SO I

01:07:56.639 --> 01:07:57.873
THINK SOME DISCOUNT WE CAN HAVE

01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:58.474
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW TO GET

01:07:58.541 --> 01:08:00.476
THERE. BUT I RECOGNIZE THE

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:03.078
PROBLEM IT IS A PROBLEM FOR ME

01:08:03.145 --> 01:08:03.746
AND IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED

01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:05.614
THANK YOU SIR. AT THE LAST

01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:08.017
QUESTION I HAVE IS RINGING PAGO

01:08:08.083 --> 01:08:09.185
PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACT

01:08:09.251 --> 01:08:11.854
AND BEFORE. THE LAW WAS PASSED

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:15.024
I BELIEVE IN GRAY DAVIS WAS IN

01:08:15.090 --> 01:08:16.692
OFFICE- CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:17.693
AGAINST EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:18.994
OF CALIFORNIA WERE ACTUALLY.

01:08:19.061 --> 01:08:20.229
DONE BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IF

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:21.664
YOU HAD A SERIOUS ENOUGH

01:08:21.730 --> 01:08:22.965
VIOLATION THAT. YOU KNOW

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:24.099
WARRANTED A CLASS ACTION

01:08:24.166 --> 01:08:25.634
LAWSUIT IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

01:08:25.701 --> 01:08:26.936
TO TAKE ACTION AND THE PRIVATE

01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:28.838
ATTORNEY GENERAL ACT PAGA HAS-

01:08:28.904 --> 01:08:30.706
PASSED AND IT'S BECOME LAW.

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:33.442
IT'S CREATED A- DISADVANTAGE TO

01:08:33.509 --> 01:08:36.812
A LOT OF- I WOULD SAY HONEST.

01:08:36.879 --> 01:08:38.614
EVERYDAY EMPLOYERS IN EMPLOYERS

01:08:38.681 --> 01:08:41.150
AREN'T PERFECT I DO NOT

01:08:41.217 --> 01:08:42.985
ANY EMPLOYER WHO STEALS WAGES

01:08:43.052 --> 01:08:44.153
DOESN'T TREAT THEIR EMPLOYEES

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.020
RIGHT DOESN'T PAY THEIR WAGES

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:46.655
CORRECTLY DOESN'T GIVE THE

01:08:46.722 --> 01:08:47.490
VACATION BENEFITS THOSE KINDS

01:08:47.556 --> 01:08:49.391
OF THINGS. I AM I'M NOT

01:08:49.458 --> 01:08:50.960
ADVOCATING FOR THAT AT ALL. BUT

01:08:51.026 --> 01:08:52.928
I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:08:52.995 --> 01:08:53.395
WAY PAGA HAS AFFECTED

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:56.599
BUSINESSES. FOR INSTANCE- AND-

01:08:56.665 --> 01:08:58.968
BUSINESSES AS THEY SAY THEY PAY

01:08:59.034 --> 01:09:01.170
WEEKLY EVERY WEEK AND ON THEIR

01:09:01.237 --> 01:09:02.905
PAYCHECK STUB IT USED TO SAY.

01:09:02.972 --> 01:09:04.707
WE CAN'T IN SEVEN ONE WEEK

01:09:04.773 --> 01:09:05.574
ENDING SEVEN EIGHT SO THE

01:09:05.641 --> 01:09:07.510
EMPLOYEE KNEW WHAT WEEK THAT

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:09.411
PAY PERIOD COVERED. WELL THE

01:09:09.478 --> 01:09:11.347
LAW UNDER LABOR CODE SECTION

01:09:11.413 --> 01:09:12.214
TWO TO SIX WHICH MOST PEOPLE

01:09:12.281 --> 01:09:14.617
DON'T KNOW. AND SAYS THAT YOU

01:09:14.683 --> 01:09:16.519
HAVE TO HAVE INCLUSIVE DATES.

01:09:16.585 --> 01:09:19.455
AND IT HAS TO HAVE. A DASH

01:09:19.522 --> 01:09:21.023
BETWEEN THE INTO COLUSA DATES.

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:22.658
SO THAT PARTICULAR EMPLOYER WAS

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:24.627
FINED OVER MILLION DOLLARS FOR

01:09:24.693 --> 01:09:27.229
NOT HAVING INCLUSIVE DATES

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:28.364
SEVEN ONE TWO SEVEN EIGHT. YOU

01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:31.200
KNOWA MILLION DOLLARS FOR

01:09:31.267 --> 01:09:31.767
PRINTED THING IN A PAYCHECK

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:34.937
STUB. AS THE AFTER YEARS OF

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:36.639
FIGHTING FOR EMPLOYERS ON PART

01:09:36.705 --> 01:09:40.943
OF THE LEGISLATURE DID. PASS A

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:41.544
PIECE OF LEGISLATION ON THEM.

01:09:41.610 --> 01:09:43.913
AT AT WAY STATEMENTS AS I GUESS

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:45.581
I WAS WHAT I CALL IT AND NOW

01:09:45.648 --> 01:09:47.216
THE SOLUTION IS TO REPRINT ALL

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:48.751
THOSE STATEMENTS FEDEX THEM

01:09:48.817 --> 01:09:50.185
OVERNIGHT TO EVERY EMPLOYEE HE

01:09:50.252 --> 01:09:51.587
WAS AFFECTED WITH THE CORRECT

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:53.489
INFORMATION ON HIM I JUST SAY

01:09:53.556 --> 01:09:55.858
ALL THAT BECAUSE PAGO LAWS ARE

01:09:55.925 --> 01:09:57.693
I AM VERY DETRIMENTAL TO A

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:58.928
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EMPLOYERS

01:09:58.994 --> 01:10:00.496
ESPECIALLY EMPLOYERS- BECAUSE

01:10:00.563 --> 01:10:02.865
THE VOLUME THAT ATTORNEYS GET-

01:10:02.932 --> 01:10:04.033
TUNER FIFTY DOLLARS PER

01:10:04.099 --> 01:10:06.135
VIOLATION PER PENALTY AND THERE

01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:07.469
COULD BE FOUR FIVE VIOLATIONS

01:10:07.536 --> 01:10:09.705
ON ONE PAYCHECK STUB. NOT

01:10:09.772 --> 01:10:11.874
HORRENDOUS NOT LIKE BY PAGE YOU

01:10:11.941 --> 01:10:13.242

YOU ONLY PAY THEM FOR TWENTY

01:10:16.378 --> 01:10:17.813
FIVE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT I'M

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.815
TALKING ABOUT THE DASH BETWEEN

01:10:19.882 --> 01:10:21.617
THE DATES I'M TALKING ABOUT

01:10:21.684 --> 01:10:23.385
APPEAL BOX VERSUS A PHYSICAL

01:10:23.452 --> 01:10:25.254

01:10:30.125 --> 01:10:30.659
LEGISLATION IN THIS POSITION.

01:10:30.726 --> 01:10:31.927
BUT THAT THAT PENALTY APPLIES

01:10:31.994 --> 01:10:34.496
TO. AND WE ALL WORK HERE IN THE

01:10:34.563 --> 01:10:35.864

FROM THE PREVIOUS ATTORNEY

GENERAL. IS IT THAT IS

01:10:58.654 --> 01:11:01.390
INACCURATE INFORMATION BECAUSE

DO THEIR WORK. WELL THIS IS A

01:11:08.364 --> 01:11:09.632
LOT FOR ANY OF OUR EMPLOYEES
