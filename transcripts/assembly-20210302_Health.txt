THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR WHAT THE CITY OPPORTUNITY- THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE AND THE PUBLIC- I DO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE A TOUGH MONEY AGAIN TODAY- I. WHAT I WILL BE DOING IS PROVIDING- OPTIONS THAT WERE PUBLISHED IN A PAPER FROM THE HELP HEALTH CARE. APPRECIATE THEIR SUPPORT THE- I WAS PUBLISHED- PRODUCED I THEIR WEBSITE- AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS GO THROUGH. FINDING AND- OPTIONS THAT ARE THAT ARE IN THE- THAT DIRECTLY THE TO- FINISH STOCK WITH THAT YOU ARE. THAT THEY ONSET OF CHARACTER WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE- FOR REALLY CHARACTER THAT OF THE IS. WE WORKED THIS FOR MANY YEARS- THAT THE ISSUE THAT FALL- REALLY ACCESS TIMELY AND COMPLETE. ELECTRONIC THE HEALTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES. IS VERY LIMITED CAL TODAY- WITHOUT IT WITH COMPLETING FOR AROUND PHYSICAL HEALTH BEHAVIOR HEALTH AND A- ARE ENDEMIC EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND HEALTHCARE POLIC PROGRAM NEEDED EVERYBODY CAN'T PASSED. AND THAT'S BECOME VERY OF IN THE- IT REALLY LAID BARE REAR- THE BILL IN THE WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIA ARE. BY IN A BILL TO SAFELY AND SECURELY CHAU FROM. NO I NEVER IN THE IN THE RIVER. WE ARE THREE DID EXCHANGE OR- TO ISSUE THAT NEED TO BE RESOLVED. OVER COMBAT AND THEN TO ADDRESS ALL OF CALIFORNIA NEED. AND HAVE A CHARACTER THEM ONE- PERSON AROUND WHO DATA. WHAT WE NEED BY THAT. IS THIRTEEN. PROVIDE PURCHASED. HAHA CLINICS AND- IN READ AND NATIONAL AND THE OR H. IDEA. IT MAY RURAL AND MANY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES NOT BY DATA EXCHANGE ACTIVITIES. THAT CLINICAL DATA FRAGMENTATION. THE SECOND CATEGORY EXCLUSION OF EXCHANGE SECTORS AND BY THAT WE MEAN THAT TEN YEARS PURCHASERS PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTIONS SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES AND PROVIDERS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND IN MOST CASES EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROVIDERS AN AGENCY CAN'T PARTICIPATE IN MOST HIV ACTIVITY. PART BECAUSE THEY WERE DESIGNED. TO EXCHANGE PHYSICAL HEALTH DATA. ALSO DUE TO THE FACT THAT MANY OF THEM DON'T HAVE ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS IN PLACE WITH WHICH THEY CAN SHARE DATA WITH OTHERS. THE THIRD CATEGORY OF ISSUES IS- IS REALLY A LEGAL ONE AND THIS IS FOCUSED ON CLICK ON COMPLEX AND RIGID EXCHANGE RULES AND REGULATIONS. AND IN THIS CASE THERE ARE MANY RESTRICTIVE AMBIGUOUS AND THE LINE STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS. THE RESULT IN MANY ORGANISATIONS ELECTING NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN DATA EXCHANGE ACTIVITIES GEARING LIABILITY AND REALLY AMBIGUITY UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE AND ARE AND ARE NOT ALLOWED TO EXCHANGE. SO THOSE ARE THE THREE MAIN CATEGORIES OF ISSUES WE'VE IDENTIFIED AND PURPORT THROUGH. A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS AND RESEARCH EXTENSIVE RESEARCH WE'VE DONE AND- I'M OVER MANY YEARS- AND MANY OF THE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE H. I. INITIATIVE COMPLEX. OUR NEXT LIKELY. NOW WE IN THIS REPORT DESCRIBED FOR SCENARIO TO REALLY HELP THE HUMAN AND- OF THIS. H. I. IN. AND WE NOTED PER THE DE IMPACT IT'S- AND ARE AMERICAN LATIN ACT NATIVE CAN WHO BEEN PART HARD HIT BY THE PANDEMIC. BUT DISPARITIES EXIST BEYOND THE PANDEMIC AND THEY EXISTED AND THEY PRE DATED AT AND THE LIMITED H. I. INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE TODAY DOES NOT SERVE THEM WELL. NOW BEFORE SCENARIOS REALLY TRIED TO CREATE THIS SEARCH WITH HUMAN PICTURE OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO AN INDIVIDUAL IN NEED FOR DIFFERENT SCENARIOS WHEN THEY TRY TO SEEK SERVICES WITH THE PROVIDERS TRY TO CARE FOR THEM. I'M TO THE FORESTERS ARE AS FOLLOWS FIRST DISASTER BONTA PRIMARILY WE'RE REALLY FOCUSING ON WALL PARTS BECAUSE THEY BECOME INCREASINGLY PRESENT AND- UNFORTUNATELY IT. AN ANNUAL. EVENT IN CALIFORNIA. AND RECENTLY THEY DISPLACED LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BALLOTS OF RESIDENTS EVACUATED AWAY FROM THEIR HOMES OUTSIDE OF THEIR COUNTIES. AND WITHOUT THESE ROBUST DATA EXCHANGE CAPABILITIES. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE THE COMPLETE INFORMATION ABOUT PATIENT NEEDS WHEN A PATIENT ARRIVES IN THE CLINICS ARE IN THE HOSPITAL WE'RE SEEKING CARE AND THEY HAVE UNLIMITED MEANS ELECTRONIC ELECTRONICALLY SHARING WHAT THEY DO NOW ONCE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE PATIENT OR THE CLIENT- IN IN THEIR IN THE NEXT IN A CLINIC OR- I SITE. THE SECOND AN RESPONSE- AND WORLD VERY OF THE ISSUES HERE BUT JUST IN. PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTIONS WE SEE DATE HAVE ACCESS TO RE TIME. IN FOR. THE CONFLICT UNIT INFORMATION- DATE ABOUT A REAL TIME VENTILATORS ACCEPT. VACCINE AND OTHER INFORMATION THAT NECESSARY TO RAPIDLY MOBILIZE RESPONSES AND RESOURCES BUT WITHOUT THAT KIND OF REAL TIME ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION. I CAN'T LINK RECORD THEY CAN'T SHOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT SOMEBODY GOT THE POT THE BLACK IS ALSO A MAN CAL FROM. WHO ALSO A SOCIAL SERVICE NEED AND ALL THOSE RESOURCES CAN RAPIDLY BE MOBILIZED TO SUPPORT THEM. SO THEY CAN'T LIKE THOSE RECORDS. PUBLIC HEALTH CANNOT DEMOBILIZE RESOURCES AND OTHER PROVIDERS TO CARE FOR THAT NUMBER BASED ON WHAT THEY'RE- A THIRD ISSUES RUN CERTAIN PATIENTS WITH COMPLEX NEEDS AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR- CALIFORNIA NOW IN IN LIGHT OF WHAT. WHAT CULT CAL AIM WHICH IS THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICE PROGRAM WHICH IS LAUNCHING NEXT YEAR. WHICH IS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS THOSE. INDIVIDUALS ENROLLED IN MEDICARE NOW- WE HAVE A NUMBER OF. TECHNIQUE IN A IF AN INNOCENT WE THE PAY WITH NEEDS OFTEN HAVE CRY MEDICAL CONDITION LIKE THAT OR HEART COULD BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL MEETING THEY HAVE A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER OR SERIOUS AND PERSISTENT MENTAL ILLNESS SOCIAL NEEDS LIKE HOUSING INSECURITY. AND THE NETWORK OF PROVIDERS THAT CERTAIN HAVE NO WAY OF SHARING VITAL INFORMATION ABOUT EACH ONE OF THOSE FACTORS. SO THAT WHEN PROVIDERS ARE TRYING TO CARE FOR THEM HELP THEM GET HOUSING HELPED THEM GET IT BUT REPORTER THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. IT'S INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT ACCESS INFORMATION TO DO THAT. AND THE RESULTANT UNCOORDINATED CARE AND INCREASED MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY FOR THOSE NUMBERS. FINALLY QUALITY REPORTING BY BASED CARE. REPAIRS HELP PLANT IN THE MEMBERS HAVE TO ACCESS TO HELP INFORMATION SO. I NEED. WHO IS TRYING TO FIND A PROVIDER FOR. GLAUCOMA FOR- AN- A CHRONIC DISEASE MAY NOT OR OR A SURGERY PROCEDURE MAY NOT HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT. PROVIDERS AND THEIR OUTCOME HOW WELL THEY PERFORM ON A PARTICULAR SURGICAL PROCEDURE HOW MUCH IT COSTS- AND SO THEY MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM CHOOSE THE PROVIDER THAT BEST MEET THEIR NEEDS AND FOR A HEALTH PLAN AND PURCHASERS TO DEVELOP VALUE BASED. PAYMENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE BASED ON THINGS LIKE QUALITY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CLINICAL DATA. THEY CAN'T REALLY USE THAT TO DRIVE DECISIONS ABOUT WHO SHOULD BE ON OUR NETWORK. AND WHAT SHOULD THE BY THE- PAYMENT PROGRAMS BE BASED ON. SO THOSE ARE THE FOUR THINGS THAT WE DESCRIBE IN OUR IN OUR REPORT. AND THAT REALLY HELPS- ILLUSTRATE THE IMPACT OF THE HUMAN TOLL OF A LOCKING. H. I. INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THE OPTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO FALL IN A MOMENT. NOT QUITE THE. SO IN TERMS OF THE KEY ACTION TAKEN THESE OPTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION SO- CLEARLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER THESE FOUR SCENARIO THERE'S A COMPLEX SENTENCE HIV CHALLENGES. THE HIGHLIGHT THE SIGNIFICANT GAPS IN OUR INFORMATION EXCHANGE CAPABILITIES AND I HAVE SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR RESIDENTS. PROVIDERS TO CARE FOR THEM AND THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AGENCIES TO COVER AND SUPPORT THEM. SO AS I MENTIONED WE SUPPORTER NUMBER STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS RESEARCH INTO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STATE POLICIES. TO HAVE SOME SOME WHICH HAVE MARKED COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE HIV. AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT- THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES- HIV STRUCTURE SERVICES AND INITIATIVES ARE BEST SUPPORTED WHEN THEY USE A RANGE OF POLICY CONTRACTING AND FINANCING LEVERS THAT THEIR YOUTH TOGETHER IN UNISON IN A COORDINATED WAY. AND SPECIFICALLY WE FOUND THAT STATES THAT HAD MORE REQUIRE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS. ONE THE BIGGEST DRAWBACK PUBLISHED A STRONG LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE WITHIN GOVERNMENT THAT HELP GUIDE POLICY AND PROGRAM ACTION ACROSS VARIOUS AGENCIES HEALTH CARE SOCIAL SERVICES PUBLIC HEALTH. AND THAT THEY CAN USE YOUR THEY USE THAT ALIGNMENT. TO ADDRESS HIV OVERCOME BARRIERS AND PRIORITIZE ACTIVITIES THAT WILL BENEFIT ALL. A SECOND ELEMENT IS CREATING A MULTI STAKEHOLDER HIV ADVISORY BODY. THAT WAY YOU'RE GETTING INPUT DIRECTLY INTO THOSE DECISION MAKERS INTO STATE GOVERNMENT TO HELP GUIDE PRIORITIES POLICIES AND PROGRAMS THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED TO THE BEST A FACT. THIRD IS THAT THE STATE IS GENERALLY INACTIVE NEW LAWS SOME OF WHICH ARE ARE ARE CALLED MANDATE SHARON. ABOUT PROMULGATED RULES TO ENCOURAGE OR REQUIRE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE AND RELATED TO THAT THE FOURTEENTH WANT IT MANY WITHOUT WORST. HELP INFORMATION EXCHANGE CONTRACTING PROVISIONS IN PUBLIC PURCHASING PROGRAMS LIKE MEDICAID OR PUBLIC EMLOYEE AND EMPLOYER PURCHASING PROGRAMS. UPFIT COMMON L. IS THERE'S A NAY AND- THAT THE STATE IN BACK. IN TECHNOLOGIES AND TRAINING. OFF THE WHICH IS BY FUNDING. THERE ARE WAYS THAT PROTECT THAT STATE MONEY DRAW INTO TEN DOLLARS SO THAT WE CAN POTENTIALLY ENHANCE THE FUNDING THAT WE CAN PROVIDE FOR TRAINING. FOR TECHNOLOGY- AND FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THEN FINALLY. WHAT WE FOUND AND WHAT THE I. PAPER ALSO PUBLISHED BY- FUTURE FROM HEALTH TECH THAT MOST OF THE STATE'S WITH MORE ABOUT ARE USED. BUT THAT OF H. T. ACT YOU CASE ARE YOU KIDDING IN FROM LIKE. WE WILL SEE- HELLO DISCHARGE TRANCE OUT OF THE- WILL MADE OF A WHEN EVER PAY AT THIS FOR HOT. OR FROM TO OR FROM AN URGENT CARE. THAT THE USE CASE. AND MANY STATE. IF THAT SITUATION- THAT OF. USE CASES WHICH THAT. INTEGRATE AND PRO PRIOR CON AND IN SOME CASES THAT MAY BE LAW. SO THOSE ARE THE KEY ACTION AND THEY'VE REALLY IN THE FOOTBALL ARE UNTIL NEXT BY THREE. THE FIRST OPTION- THAT REALLY SORT TRAN. AND IT'S REALLY MY TO ADDRESS ALL THE THESE OPTIONS BOB- IS- FIRST TO ALLOW LEADERSHIP STATE. REGULAR HELP AND IMPLEMENT SERVICES A THE AND BY. WE MEAN THAT CALIFORNIA COULD STOP AN OFF. AND LED BY BOARD WITH IN STATE GOVERNMENT. THAT WOULD BE CHARGED WITH THE- AGE INITIATIVE TO ALIGN OF FINE BECAUSE- A POLICY LEADERS STATE. NOT WHAT THAT COULD LOOK LIKE. THAT THIS OFF THE COULD BE FIFTY OFFICER NEW OFF THE CRITIC FOR IN THE TOP HEALTH AND HUMAN. THEY. OR OUT FOR BUT THE OFFICE COULD BEACH WITH THE STATE. GOALS AND PRIORITIES FOR ADVANCING AND FOR X. SO THAT'S YOU START. REALLY BEGINS WITH WHAT WE WERE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH. THE SECOND IS THE OFFICE CA BE IN AND OUT WITH WILL MAKING FORTY. AND WHAT THAT WOULD IT WOULD ALIGN REGULAR. CON LIKE AND- LEVERS OF TO GOVERNMENT. TOOK THAT H. I. E. THAT COULD MEAN THAT WE MAKING A UPON TO. DEPARTMENTS IN IN TERMS OF. WHAT WOULD REQUIRE. THEIR CALL. TO DO WITH RESPECT THAT. HELP EXCHANGE ACTIVITY TOOK COULD REQUIRE THAT THEY- HAVE ALL THE- IN NETWORK- TO THE PAID INCOME WAY INTO SORT OF H. I. ACT THAT. SAYS GOAL- OFFICE COULD ALSO BE CHARGE WITH THE BELT RECOMMEND. TO HARMONIZE STATE AT CONFLICTS WITH. LAW AND TO THE CLEAR HELP INFORMATION EXCHANGE. AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THE STATE AGENCIES INSTEAD. SO THERE ARE MANY STAY LAWS THAT WERE TO. AROUND PRIVACY PRIVACY INTO. PER SOME OF WHICH WERE. BEFORE A I. EVEN REALLY IN. GONNA CONFLICT WITH LAW. AND SOME OF THOSE REALLY DO NEED TO REVIEW AND REFINED. AND UPDATED TO BRING US INTO THE FIRST. AND FINALLY THE THIRD THIS- THAT OPTION INCLUDE- CREATING A MULTI STATE HELP INFORMATION EXCHANGES BOARD- AND THAT COULD INCLUDE STATE AND COUNTY A REP. AS A HIMSELF SO SERVICE PROVIDERS PUBLIC HOW CONCERN AND OTHER TO THE RECORD. TO HELP ADVANCE PRIORITIES TO HELP DEVELOP USE CASES- AND TO IDENTIFY THINGS LIKE STATE LAW THAT WOULD BE DOES NEED TO BE UPDATED BROUGHT INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY HARMONIZE WITH FEDERAL LAW. THAT'S ONE OF AND AGAIN YOU'LL SEE IT AS GO THROUGH MORE. OF HAVING THAT KIND OF IN AWE. AND THIS KIND OF. IS REALLY. I THINK MATHIS OR TO REALLY ENABLE ME TO OTHERS I OTHER OPTIONS AS WELL. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO NEXT- IS REALLY OPTIONS TO ADDRESS CLING DATA FRANK COOKIE REMEMBER THE BEGINNING OF MY TESTIMONY I MENTION THESE THREE DIFFERENT- PROBLEMS ARE CHALLENGE CATEGORIES THE FIRST ONE WITH CLINICAL DATA FRAGMENTATION AND THIS IS WHERE. WE HAVE INCOMPLETE LIKE CLINICAL DATA NOT BEING SHARED SOME REGIONS DON'T HAVE LIKE A REALLY ROBUST OR OR VIRTUALLY ANY H. CAPABILITIES OUT IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR CHALLENGE- THIS OPTION WOULD. STATEWIDE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE REQUIREMENTS. MANDATE FOR EXAMPLE PLUS CREATING CENTER THE PANEL FROM BROUGHT H. I. U. OF THE BY PLAN AND PROVIDERS AND HEALTH CARE SOCIAL SERVICE EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS. SO THIS COULD FOR EXAMPLE REQUIRE- INCREASE ENACT A NEW LAW THAT WOULD. HOSPITALS PROVIDERS HEALTH PLANS AND OTHERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SECOND SPECIFIED HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE ACTIVITY. THAT MET SPECIFIC STATE HEALTH CARE PUBLIC HEALTH SOCIAL SERVICES AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE CALLS. THE REQUIREMENTS COULD ALSO BE DESIGNED BY THE BY THE NEW OFFICE. WITH INPUT FROM THE ADVISORY BOARD. AND THEY SHOULD. AND THEY SHOULD ALIGN WITH AND REINFORCE FEDERAL RULES UNDER THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CURES ACT HIPAA AND ELSEWHERE THE LAST THING WE NEED TO DO IS CREATE NEW STATE LAW. THE COMPLEX WITH FEDERAL LAW WE HAVE ENOUGH OF THOSE. WE REALLY NEED TO HARMONIZE WE NEED TO RIDE ON FEDERAL LAW THAT IS REALLY TRYING TO ADVANCE THE MORE GOALS BRAND HIV. NOW WHAT I MEAN IS A MODEST SUGGEST THAT MANDATE LIKE JUST A REQUIRE THAT YOU MUST. HAVE BEEN HIV THE FISH ON ABOUT AND IT REALLY NEEDS BE COUPLE WITH A COUPLE OF THINGS WE IS. PURCHASE CONTRACTING AND OF REQUIRE. AND PRO TO STIMULATE H. PART TO. THE BACK BE THAT REQUIREMENT IN HIV PRO- FOR CONTRACTED PROVIDERS WOULD BE PUT INTO A CONTRACT AND THAT THEY'RE BEING HIV PROGRAM INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT ACTUALLY PAYS THEM INCENTIVES FOR MEETING MILESTONES. THE SECOND- AREA AROUND THE CORPORATION THOSE TYPES OF H. I. IN AND GOALS TO CLASS PROGRAM. I'M LOOKING THINK THAT THERE IS THAT OF THE MISSION QUALITY. AND WE CEASE TYPE OF THAT BY INTEGRATE CARE SO ARE HA ALL I KNOW PERFORM PROGRAM AND IN THE EARLY OF CHECK FOR PETER ARAMBULA SIMILAR. OF. TAKE A DEPARTMENTS MAY WHEN IT TO THINGS LIKE REPORTING LAW RESULTS DATA TO HELP FROM THE BACK SPOKE. THE THINGS OF THE BUT AND REALLY HELP BY AND SUPPORT- IT AND KIND OF A COVER. FOR AMANDA. NEXT LIKELY. SO THE SECOND FARM- YOUR AREA THE EXTRA SECTOR AND IF YOU'RE FROM BEGINNING A TEST TOMORROW HERE THIS THING CLEAN LIKE BEHAVIOR HEALTH SOCIAL SERVICES AND FROM PUBLIC HEALTH AND THAT WERE DON'T PART IN AN H. I. E. TODAY A TWENTY THE THESE OPTIONS INCLUDE ONE. ESTABLISHING FINANCING PRO THAT STATEWIDE IS A BEHAVIOR SOCIAL SERVICE STATE X. NOW ABOUT TWELVE YEARS AGO THERE IS A LAW PASSED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE I WITH THAT AMERICAN RECOVERY IN REINVESTMENT ACT ARE UP. AND IT'S PART OF THAT THERE IS A BILL CALLED HIGH TECH. HI TECH- ALSO- THE PROGRAMS ON THE PALM COMMUNIQU FOR USE. PROVIDED OVER THIRTY FIVE BILL DOLLAR NATIONALLY HELP PROVIDER. AND HA BUT CLINICS AND HOSPITALS. PUT ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS THAT WERE IN PLACE TO IMPLEMENT. TWELVE YEARS AGO MOST OF OUR CARE SO WITH BILL PAY BASED. AFTER TWELVE YEARS WITH OVER THIRTY FIVE DOLLAR IN FAT INVEST- MO OF THE HOT. AND CLINICS TODAY AND CAL ACTUALLY INTEROPERABLE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE BUT WE STILL DON'T HAVE. THOSE KIND OF SYSTEMS IN PLACE WITH OUR MANY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS AND VERY FEW SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OTHERS ACTUALLY HAVE ANYTHING LIKE. A PLATFORM LIKE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR DATA EXCHANGE. SO WHAT THIS IS PROPOSING IS A SET OF FINANCING PROGRAMS TO HELP BRING THOSE OTHER TYPES OF PROVIDERS UP ON RECORDS THAT CAN SHARE DATA- I CREATE FINANCING STREAMS TO ACTUALLY ALLOW THEM TO EXCHANGE DATA. WITH OTHER PROVIDERS INCLUDING PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES TO FOR EXAMPLE RESPONSE THE PANDEMIC. AND THEN RELATED WHICH IS THE FOURTH ITEM HERE- IS TO UPGRADE CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HEALTH AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE INFORMATION EXCHANGE INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WE KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE MONEY COMING FROM THE CDC TO HELP- BILL THAT CAPABILITIES WE SHOULD LEVERAGE AND SUPPLEMENT THAT FUNDING WITH STATE RESOURCES UPGRADE OUR COUNTY SURVEILLANCE OUR STATE AND COUNTY SURVEILLANCE REPORTING AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM. WE SHOULD BE CREATING INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH EMERGENCY RESPONSE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SYNDROMIC SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM. AND PROVIDE FUNDING TO TRAIN PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE AND USE THE REQUIRED INFRASTRUCTURE. THE NEW PUT NEW SYSTEMS AND YOU CAN'T BOTTOM ASSUME THAT THE WORKFORCE NOW HOW TO USE THAT THERE NEED TO BE EDUCATED AND TRAINED THEIR- ABOUT THE FOR ABOUT THE- OP. AFTER CONSIDER AND THEN THERE'S MORE MORE SET ON A SLIDE PLEASE. AND THIS IS REALLY AROUND BARRIER ARE A COM IN OUR STATUS OR- AND THERE TWO OPTIONS HERE TO CONSIDER. THE FIRST TO ENACT LAW. THANK RECOMMENDED MADE THE NEW ALL AND IT SAID BY THREE TRY DONE UP BY CONFLICTING AND THEN. THEY HELP THE COMMISSION PRIVACY IN SECURITY. AND I THINK HELP HELP TAKE A CO TO HARMONIZE THE WITH FEDERAL. NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT EVERY THE CAN AND. SHOULD NOT. BE ABOLISHED TERM THEIR NOT CERTAIN LAWS PROTECT PATIENT. COP AND TO FOR GOOD REASON. AND WEBER YOU CAN TO PURSUE. BUT IT NEEDS TO GO FOR A PROFIT REVIEW. AND TO ME FOR IDENTIFY WHAT SHOULD REMAIN. AND WHAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE UPDATED BECAUSE IT'S ANTIQUATED. NOW ONCE THAT PROCESS IS GONE THROUGH OR INCREASE IN AND IN PARALLEL. BOB ONE OPTION AS WELL WHICH WOULD REALLY HELP SHARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA THAT IT TO DEFINE REQUIREMENTS FOR WHAT. OUR CALLING A STATE WIDE UNIVERSAL INFORMED CONSENT MODEL AND STANDARD CONTENT AUTHORIZATION FORMS. BUT THAT WOULD REALLY HELP TO IS IT WOULD HELP IDENTIFY THROUGH THIS THESE TYPES OF THAT FRAMEWORK. AND THROUGH A STANDARDIZED STATEWIDE CONSENT FORM. WHAT STATE LAW NEED TO BE FOR. WHAT TYPE OF CONTENT YOU NEED FROM RESIDENTS IN ORDER TO SHARE INFORMATION SO THAT THOSE WHO PARTICIPATE FEEL LIKE THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LAW SAYS. AND THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS THAT THEY ARE AND ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SHARE. NOW WE CAN THE WHAT THIS OPTION WOULD INCLUDE USING CONTRACTING AND LICENSING LEVERS AGAIN THAT'S THE THEME WHAT LOVERS CAN WE USE AT THE DISPOSAL OF STATING COUNTY AGENCIES. AND PRIVATE PURCHASERS TO INCENTIVIZE YOU REQUIRE THAT THESE POLICIES BE USED BY PLAN PROVIDERS AND OTHERS WERE PARTICIPATING. IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. I MEAN I'M FINALLY- THERE SOME EMERGING- THAT DIFFERENT FROM- EFFORTS TO CREATE CONTENT AROUND DAY USE AGREE. UNTIL OPTION IS PART OF THE WOULD BE TO A PARTS WITH PUBLIC- TRUSTED EXCHANGE OR C. TEN TO SUPPORT WITH CAL HEALTH INFORMATION. AND NASH NETWORK. AND TO BY DOCTOR CALLED THE SO IF THE DATA SHARING A- THAT PART OF A BROADER SET OF DATA SHARING AND CONTENT POLICIES THAT WOULD BE DEVELOPED HERE. I'M AND THAT'S- AND THAT THAT ESSENTIALLY CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY SO I'M HAPPY AT WHATEVER POINT IN TIME- DOCTOR WOULD AND NUMBERS THEY HAVE NOTHING TO HELP MANY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH JOHN AND SEE IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE HERE. I DO HAVE- I DO HAVE A COUPLE MYSELF AND- PRECIADO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIONY HERE. SO YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE POLICY ISSUES AROUND SURROUNDING HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. SO IF YOU WERE TO WAVE A MAGIC WAND WHAT STEPS YOU KNOW WOULD YOU RECOMMEND CALIFORNIA TAKE. I HAVE BEEN AROUND THE BLOCK ON THIS TOPIC BEFORE- I ABOUT TWELVE YEARS AGO- I WITH THAT THE DEPUTY SECRETARY IN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AND HELP IMPLEMENT HIGH TECH- AND IN THAT POSITION IT WITH. IT WAS WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE REALLY HELPED TRYING TO ADVANCE- CHARM COMMITTEE AND HELP INFORMATION EXCHANGE- WE'RE HAD T OUR DISPOSAL. THE FEDERAL FUNDING. BUT THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE- AND THEN THEY WERE SENT THE PAYMENT THAT WERE MADE THROUGH DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES NOT A COW. BUT THERE IS NO AUTHORITY OTHER THAN. THE ABILITY TO DRIVE DOWNTOWN FUNDS IN THAT OFFICE. HI THAT WAS ONE OF REAL LIMIT- ABOUT POSITION AND- AND WEBER SO ABOUT OR CREATE AGAIN IF THERE WERE NOT POWER TO THIRTY EIGHT THAT. FOR THE FIRST OPTION THAT ARE LAID OUT THE PLAYED OUT HERE- I COULD WAVE A MAGIC WAND THAT WOULD BE ESTABLISHED AND YOU'D HAVE. YOU HAVE AN ADVISORY BOARD THAT REALLY UNDERSTAND FUNDAMENTALLY THE ISSUES FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS AND PURCHASERS OF PUBLIC HEALTH. WHO COULD REALLY HELP INFORM. IN A CONSTRUCTIVE WAY. WHAT NEDS TO BE DONE AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE PRIORITIZED. THAT WOULD BE NUMBER ONE. AND NUMBER TWO WOULD BE IT'S ONE THAT IS REALLY CLEARLY ESTABLISHED- WHAT WHAT TO PRIORITIZE- REALLY WHERE TO FOCUS. IS THAT THE STATE WOULD PROVIDE FUNDING THAT COULD BE MATCHED WITH FEDERAL ANOTHER DOLLARS- TWO TWO I REALLY DON'T THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT. THAT'S NEEDED- NOT JUST FOR PHYSICAL HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE BUT- FOR SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT ARE PROVIDING HOUSING SUPPORT SERVICES. TO CONNECT THE JAIL WITH PROVIDERS IN THE COMMUNITY SO WHEN A PATIENT WHEN A RESIDENT- WE'VE INCARCERATIONS. THE CLINIC THAT ACTUALLY GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THEM THE COMMUNITY HAS A FULL ACCOUNT OF THAT RECORD THE PRESCRIPTION AND OTHER MEDICAL INFORMATION. AND FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM WITH WHEN THIS HAPPENED AGAIN- WHEN THE NEXT RESPONSE THAT I'S IMPORTANT-ORDERS FOR THE NEXT A WILDFIRE I LIVE IN DAVIS BUT THE FACT THAT. THE SUSPECT ME PERSONALLY MY FAMILY. THAT HEALTH HAS BEEN. THEY NEED TO MOBILIZE QUICKLY. THEY KNOW WHO'S BEING IMPACTED THEY KNOW WHAT SOCIAL SERVICES. SERVICES BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES THEY NEED TO WORK THEIR FACT HE WAITED. TWENTY CHASING COUNTY. SOME SAFE. WHERE THEY TO PROVIDE AND THAT I CARE HAVE A FULL ACCOUNT OF WHAT THAT AND I AM. WELL SO THANK YOU ALMOST INTO MY ADDITIONAL HERE BUT- WHAT ONE THAT THAT YOU DIDN'T QUITE HIT ON THAT. THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT HERE IS THAT. WHAT WHAT DO YOU WHAT PAYER SHOULD REPORT DATA FOR EXAMPLE SHOULD COUNTY MILK MENTAL HEALTH PLANS OR COUNTY DRUG MEDI PLANS RISA PLANS. WHO WOULD YOU HAVE AMONG THE YOU KNOW THOSE WOULD YOU HAVE THEM ALL REPORTING OR YOU THINK OR OR- IS THERE IS THERE. A WAY OR A PRIOR THERE. YEAH MEAN I IDEALLY WE WOULD ALLOW ALL OF THE DATA WITHIN REASON I MEAN THAT THERE OBVIOUSLY SOME LIMITATIONS ON WHAT THE STATE CAN DO FOR AN ORIGINALLY PLANNED FOR. THAT ARE THAT ARE WHERE FEDERAL OVER AND NOT STATE OVERSIGHT BUT IDEALLY. HERE'S BE ABLE TO REPORT DATA PREPARE STAFF ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLAIMS DATA I MEAN THAT'S REALY WHAT THEY HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSAL DISPOSAL BY AND LARGE- AND FOR- YOU KNOW THE PHARMACY THAT. A CLAIM IS VERY MUCH LIKE IT'S ALMOST. CLINICAL BECAUSE IT DESCRIBES THE PRESCRIPTION THAT WAS ACTUALLY DISPENSE. BUT I'LL TELL YOU THAT THE PERSON. MATT FOREMAN AND FOR YOU CAN MAKE INFERENCES ABOUT WHAT THAT INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS WHO. SPENT THAT DRUG HABIT YOU CAN'T. NOT DETERMINE IT RIGHT DOESN'T MEAN THEY HAVE DIABETES BUT IT'S INFORMATION THAT IT'S IMPORTANT. BUT IT'S BASICALLY ADMINISTRATOR SO IT'S LIMITED AND CAN HELP INFORM THINGS LIKE THE VALUE OR THE PRICE THAT WAS PAID FOR A SERVICE. BUT IT GENERALLY CAN'T TELL YOU HOW CLINICAL OUTCOMES. BOTH DATA LIVE WITHIN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS OR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH RECORDS. AND SO YEAH PLAN SHOULD ALL PLANS IDEALLY SHOULD BE SHARING ADMINISTRATIVE DATA LIKE CLAIM. BUT THEY ALSO SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO WITH THE CLINIC RESTRICTIONS ABOUT HOW THEY CAN USE THAT. CLINICAL INFORMATION THAT THEY CAN UNDERSTAND WHO THE WHO THE HIGH QUALITY PROVIDERS ARE WHO THEY MAY WANT HAPPEN THOSE NETWORKS BECAUSE THEY HAVE GOOD OUTCOME. WHAT THE COST OF THE SERVICES ARE THAT THEY GET- THAT THEY PAY FOR. THAT YOU WE CAN ACTUALLY. BEND THE COST CURVE. THAT'S GREAT. SO YOU'VE YOU'VE BEEN YOU'VE BEEN A STUDENT THIS FOR MANY MANY YEARS SO- THEN THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT'S OUT THERE- THERE ARE H. I. EASE THAT ARE OPERATING OUT THERE BUT THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT TERRIBLY LINKED. I THINK THERE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO FEEL THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD STUDY THE NEED FOR THIS YOU KNOW THIS THIS GOING FORWARD RATHER THAN ACTUALLY MOVING ON SOMETHING- I GUESS I'M GOING TO GUESS THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY YOU'VE STUDIED THIS FOR THE LAST TWELVE YEARS. DO YOU THINK WE REALLY NEED ANOTHER STUDY OR SHOULD WE BE MOVING ON SOMETHING AT THIS POINT. IN YOUR OPINION ALL. IN MY OPINION WE START YEAH WE'VE DONE WE'VE STUDIED THE ISSUE. BUT I MEAN WE KNOW EVERYTHING- I THINK THE TIME FOR ACTION IS NOW I THERE'S IN MY MIND THERE'S NO NEED TO WAIT AND STUDY THE PROBLEM ANY LONGER. BUT WHAT REALLY IS NECESSARY AS PART OF THIS PROCESS. IS TO HAVE A REALLY CLEAR SET OF GOALS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO WORK TOWARDS. AND THAT REALLY NEED TO COME FROM THE STATE. THEY NEED TO HAVE AN ARTICULATED POINT OF VIEW ABOUT WHAT KIND OF HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE ACTIVITIES WE WANT TO SUPPORT TO ENABLE SPECIFIC STATE GOAL. THAT WOULD REQUIRE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME FOR STAKEHOLDERS TO ALL FOR THE STATE AND STAKEHOLDERS TO REALLY SORT OF MAKE THAT PROCLAMATION. AND WHEN THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THAT SORT OF THAT INTERNAL ANALYSIS AND THAT- AND ADVANCING RECOMMENDATION. YES THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE DONE AND WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE DONE. TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND HOW THEY'RE EXCHANGING INFORMATION TO ADVANCE. POLICY AND PROGRAM GOALS. SO WE SHOULD NEVER STOP STUDYING THE ISSUE BECAUSE YOU CAN ALWAYS LEARN SOMETHING. BUT I THINK GENERALLY WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT NEEDS TO GET DONE NOW THEY'RE BIG GAPS IN PHYSICAL HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE WE NEED TO CLOSE THOSE GAPS WE NEED. THIS FINANCING IF NECESSARY. AND THERE MAY BE NEED TO BE POLICY AND REGULATORY THINGS LIKE MANDATE. WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A NEED FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. INFORMATION EXCHANGE WITH CLINICAL DATA AND WE NEED TO COME UP WITH POLICIES TO ENABLE TO DO THAT. WE KNOW THERE IS A NEED TO ACCESS SOCIAL SERVICE DATA LIKE HOUSING. INFORMATION AND THAT THERE'S A NEED FOR CAPACITY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE TO HELP SUPPORT AND MAKE THE BRIDGE BETWEEN HOMELESS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM. AND ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD. IT CAN BE DONE WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER COMMUNITIES THERE ARE GOOD STUDIES THAT HAVE SHOWN HOW IT CAN BE DONE AS BEST PRACTICES. IT'S REALLY TIME AT THIS POINT IMPLEMENTABLE AND TO PRIORITIZE THAT WE CAN- THE QUINT. AND INTERNET. SO I'M THINKING AHEAD A LITTLE BIT SO IF WE HAD. A ROBUST SORT OF CENTRALIZED STATE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE. I JUST THINK ABOUT THE VALUE POTENTIAL VALUE OF THAT IN THE COVIDIEN COVERT FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS A GREAT INTERVIEW ON NPR RECENTLY THAT I LISTEN TO THAT TALKED ABOUT THAT WE DON'T KNOW THE EFFICACY OF THE CODE NINETEEN VACCINE FOR THE LONG HAUL WE DON'T KNOW THAT. BUT IF WE HAD INTO IT WE HAD A WAY TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT THAT DATA S IF WE KNEW THE PATIENT. CONTRACTED IT LATER ON- WE COULD BE DOING SOME OF THESE HEALTH POPULATION STUDIES TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT WE CAN'T DO THAT NOW BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS COMPLETELY FRAGMENTED- AND THAT'S- LAST NIGHT I WAS ON A CALL- REGARDING. WITH WITH OUR ADMINISTRATION- REGARDING- ISSUES AROUND COVE IT. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ASKED OF THE STATE IS YOU KNOW CAN YOU TELL US- HOW MANY YOU KNOW IN STATEWIDE AND IN EVERY COUNTY YOU KNOW- BREAKDOWN OF THE NUMBER OF CASES THE NUMBER OF VACCINES THAN THE ETHNICITY OF WHO'S GETTING THEM IN. AND THE ANSWER WAS NOT REALLY WE DON'T HAVE WE CAN'T DO THAT RIGHT WE CAN'T EASILY DO THAT WE CAN DO IT BUT IT REQUIRES LOTS OF PAPER AND LOTS OF LOTS OF COORDINATION BUT BUT WITH THE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE WE COULD PROBABLY DO THAT WITH WITH WITH QUERIES AND NOT A TO DO. TOO DIFFICULT WAY IF IT WAS. PUT TOGETHER RIGHT. RIGHT THERE THE BUT PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT CALIFORNIA HAVE TODAY LIKE CAL READY AND CARE FOR NOT DESIGNED FOR A GLOBAL PANDEMIC- AND IT AND IT'S CLEAR YOU KNOW THE- IT WAS SO CAL READY WAS NOT ABLE TO HANDLE JUST THE VOLUME THE SHEER VOLUME OF DATA. FOR EVERY RESIDENT IN THE STATE TO GET TAX ON A ROUTINE BASIS THE CAP THAT CAPACITY DID NOT OCCUR. CARE WHICH IS THE SET OF IMMUNIZATION REGISTRIES WAS REALLY DESIGNED. FOR PEDIATRIC MOSTLY FOR PEDIATRIC IMMUNIZATION NOT. AS A REPOSITORY FOR AND FOR AND FOR. OUR SYSTEM THAT'S GOING TO VACCINATE EVERY SINGLE RESIDENT AND HELP TRACKING REPORT ALL OF THAT EVEN THOUGH IT'S BACK ACTUALLY DOING A FAIRLY GOOD JOB WITH THINGS LIKE INVENTORY MANAGEMENT NOT PERFECT. THERE ARE SOME INTERFACES WITH THE HR SO SOME OF THIS ACTUALLY KIND OF WORKS- AND YOU GOTTA GIVE HIM CREDIT- THEY DON'T GET A LOT OF IT BUT YOU GOT TO GIVE SOME CREDIT TO THEM. BUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR. WORKING TIRELESSLY. NOW WHAT DATE WHAT ISN'T HAPPENING. WHAT YOU MENTIONED. WE DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO LINK A RECORD I THINK THE PUBLIC HEALTH HAS ON A POSITIVE TAX OR EVEN A VACCINE LET'S JUST SAY A POSITIVE TAX. EFFECT OF THAT PERSON ARE THEY A MEDIC CAL DO THEY GET FOOD STAMPS DO THEY ARE THEY HOMELESS. THAT INTEGRATION OF DATA. THAT BACK BACK BY LOAD DATA. IT DOES NOT ALLOW PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE PROVIDERS WHO SERVE THE INDIVIDUAL WHO JUST GOT TESTED POSITIVE FOR COVERT NINETEEN THE VIRUS THE CAUGHT COVER NINETEEN. THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE DATA LINKED TOGETHER AND A WAY TO. IDENTIFY THE TO THEY CAN IMMEDIATELY RESPOND AND SAY OKAY WE KNOW THIS INDIVIDUALS ON MEDICAID. WE KNOW WHAT THOSE BENEFITS ARE WE CAN MOBILIZE THOSE MEDICAL SERVICES TO THAT INDIVIDUAL. WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE DATE THAT THEY'RE ON FOOD STAMPS. WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO LIKELY HAVE PRUDENT SECURITY SO WE NEED TO MOBILIZE FOOD TO THEIR PRESIDENT BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE T BE- ISOLATING FOR TWO WEEKS- OUR IF THEY'RE UNEMPLOYED THAT THEY DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A PAYCHECK SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR INCOME- FURTHER YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE THAT CAPABILITY AND IF WE WERE JUST. AND IF WE WERE TO PRIORITIZE. THE ABILITY FOR SYSTEMS TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH PUBLIC HEALTH AND- PUBLIC HEALTH THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE ALONG WITH THE OTHER AGENCIES TO MARRY THOSE DATA. ORDER THE LONGITUDINAL TYPE OF STUDY SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY PHOEBE AFRICA THE LIKE YOU'RE STAYING FOR LONG HAULERS. WE HAVE A BETTER PICTURE OF HOW TO RESPOND AND WHAT THE IMPACT OF COVERED IT'S BEEN FOR SOME OF THE RESIDENTS WHO ARE. ADVERSELY IMPACTED. I ALSO CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT OUR OUR ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO ACCESS VACCINES AND TESTING. WOULDN'T BE DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED IF YOUR PROVIDER. COULD QUERIA SYSTEM AND SAY. AND LOOK AT ALL THE VACCINE AVAILABILITY OR ALL THE TESTING AVAILABILITY AND MATCH YOU UP IT WOULD PREVENT YOU AS THE CONSUMER FROM HAVING TO MAKE CALL AFTER CALL AFTER CALL. OR SPENT HOURS AT A COMPUTER TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO GET A VACCINE. OR OR WHATEVER IF WE HAD THE ABILITY TO SYNTHESIZE THIS INFORMATION IN A WAY. THE OUTCOME IN AND OF AND THE USER EXPERIENCE WOULD BE GREATLY ENHANCED- I THINK. IT CERTAINLY WHAT. WE'RE EXPERIENCING THAT NOW IN TERMS OF TRYING TO GET ACCESS TO VACCINES FOR TEACHERS. WE'RE TRYING TO FIND WHERE'S THE DOOR IF I CAN FIND UP AND GET BACK TO ME THAT THOUGH. WE CAN GET OUR KIDS TO SCHOOL BUT BACK IN THE SCHOOL MORE MORE RAPIDLY. WORK THAT ANY TEACHER HOW CAN TELL YOU WE'RE GOING TO THAT PROCESS RIGHT NOW AND IT AND IT IS CHALLENGING. WE DON'T HAVE WE DID NOT DESIGN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE TODAY. AND ALL THAT- SO ABSOLUTELY THAT IS. THAT'S ONE OF THE OUTCOMES OF NOT HAVING. WHAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO SUPPORT. ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS IN GETTING- BACK TO BACK WINS UNDERSTANDING APPLY CHAIN AND- ALL THE CAPITA ISSUES YOU JUST MENTIONED. THANK YOU I'M I THINK DECEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY HAD A QUESTION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE THE BEST HEARING IN THIS ROOM IS REALLY ACCURATE SO I APOLOGIZE BUT THERE'S YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT KIND OF I JUST WANT YOU TO SEE IF YOU TO DRESS AND YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY IN THE PRESENTATION BUT- YOU KNOW I HAVE A CONCERN OF HOW WELL THE EXCHANGE OF HEALTH INFORMATION CALIFORNIA EVER A LINE WITH FEDERAL REGULATIONS. YEAH I MEAN I THERE IS SO CALIFORNIA HAS A VERY COMPLEX. WEB- NIELSEN POLICIES- PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICIES AND SOME OF THEM- SOMEONE DO CONFLICT WITH FEDERAL LAW- AND I- HI I DON'T THINK THEY'LL EVER. IN MY LIFETIME AT LEAST COMPLETELY HARMONIZE MEANING THAT. WE ARE JUST GOING TO DISCARD OUR LAW THEY WERE PLANNING TO FEDERAL LAW. THERE ARE AND THERE THERE MAY BE VERY GOOD REASONS FOR- AND RATIONALES FOR WHY CERTAIN POLICIES LIKE HIV I THINK THERE'S VERY GOOD REASON WHY. THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS AROUND. SHARING DATA WITHOUT INFORMED CONSENT. I AND THERE. SO WE MAY NEVER GET TO A POINT WHERE WE ARE COMPLETELY ALIGNED WITH FEDERAL POLICY. WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK FOR US TO MEANINGFULLY. ENGAGE IN DATA EXCHANGE IT FOR THE STATE TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING WHAT WHO DON'T ALIGN. AND SHOULD WE TRY TO AMEND. BECAUSE I THERE'S NO RATIONAL OR THE RATIONALE DOES NOT SUIT THE CURRENT DATE MEANS. THE MADE INTERNATIONAL TWENTY YEARS AGO. OR EVEN TEN YEARS AGO BUT TODAY THE RATIONALES CHANGED OR THE SYSTEMS OF CHANGE TO OVERCOME. THE REASON WHY THE POLICY WAS CREATED IN THE FIRST PLACE. WE GO THROUGH A RIGOROUS PROCESS OF. REVIEWING ALL OF THOSE RULES AROUND CALIFORNIA DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY. AND WE IDENTIFY THOSE POLICIES THAT WE THINK SHOULD BE CHANGED OR HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE COULD BE REVIVED WHAT WOULD BE LEFT WITH OUR SET THE POLICY THAT WE COLLECTIVELY AGREE. SHOULD REMAIN THAT DIFFER FROM FEDERAL POLICY. AND IN THAT CONTEXT YOU CONSTRUCT A CONSENT THAT THAT THAT DOCUMENT THAT BASICALLY CALL THOSE POLICIES OUT THERE WE RECOGNIZED THAT THEY EXIST BUT THEY'RE DIFFERENT WITH FEDERAL POLICY. IF WE INFORM OUR PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS ABOUT THE POLICIES. BUT THEY UNDERSTAND HOW THEIR DATA CAN BE USED. THAT'S ABOUT AS GOOD AS WE CAN DOAND IF WE CAN CREATE THAT KIND OF A UNIVERSAL CONSENT FRAMEWORK AND SET OF DOCUMENTS. WE'LL HAVE CAN ONLY COUNCIL WILL HAVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS WILL HAPPEN TO HELP PROVIDERS BEING MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE. BUT THERE'S BEEN LIKE A STATE INCOME ON TOUR ON TO SEND OF DOCUMENTS AND GUIDELINES. THAT FOLLOW AND RESPECT THE RULE OF LAW AND THE WISHES OF RESIDENTS. YEAH RIGHT HER COMMENT WAS WHAT A WEB SELF. YEAH. I THINK WE MAY HAVE A COUPLE OF MEMBERS WERE PARTICIPATING REMOTELY AS WELL SEE IF THEY'RE OUT THERE IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AND I'M NOT EVEN SURE HOW WE DO THAT BUT- THE. WELL APPARENTLY APPARENTLY NOT OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH- JOHN I REALLY APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION AND- WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD MOVE ONTO OUR NEXT PANEL. THANK YOU DOCTORATE. SO FOR OUR SECOND PANEL WE'VE INVITED A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS AND ASK THEM ADDRESS TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AS IT RELATES TO STATE PRIORITIES IN FOR BRAT BROAD CATEGORIES EACH PANELIST WILL HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO ADDRESS OUR ISSUES AND FOR THIS PANEL WILL ASK EACH OF THE PANELISTS TO MUTE AND UNMUTE THEMSELVES AND I THINK WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL HAVE EACH PANELIST ADDRESS ISSUES WE HAVE THERE AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS FROM FROM FROM EACH OF THEM RATHER THAN DOING IT- YOU KNOW DOING IT ONE AT A TIME THEY'RE SO. SO OUR FIRST TO AND THEY WERE TO HAVE YOUR ACCOUNTING THERE ARE SEVERAL TOGETHER SO- OUR FIRST AND WE WILL BEGIN WITH- SEIU I'M AT LEAST THE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS- THAT IF YOU'RE OUT THERE AND YOU ALMOST EVERYBODY KNOWS THE QUESTIONS OF THESE THERE'S NO SURPRISE HERE SO- THE TRANSITION TO HER DOCTOR WOULD. OFTEN TEAR. CAN YOU HEAR ME OK WE SURE CAN'T THANK YOU. THE RADIO YOU CAN SEE IT TOO. OKAY SO THAT WAS A WITH US YEAH YOU CALIFORNIA FIRST JUST THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING OUR PERSPECTIVE IN THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE DATA SHARING CALIFORNIA- IT'S A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU ALL- BIG COVE IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS REALLY SHINE A LIGHT ON THE NUMBER OF PROBLEMS THAT EXIST THROUGHOUT THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM- I WAS THE FIRST QUESTION A LITTLE ALLUDES TO WHICH IS HOW CAN CALIFORNIA DEVELOP WAY EACH ID POLICY THAT BEST SUPPORTS THE STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES AND EFFORTS TO RESPOND TO THE CURRENT AND FUTURE A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. THE CHRONIC UNDERFUNDING OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE HAS MANIFESTED ITSELF DURING THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE IN NUMBER OF WAYS- FROM THE FAILURES OF THAT CALTRAIN THE SYSTEM TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE VACCINE DISTRIBUTION AND TRACKING. ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES IS BY ENSURING THAT WE ARE COLLECTING AND SHARING DATA AT SCALE- HOWEVER RIGHT NOW I SEE ARE YOU MEMBERS ARE STILL USING FAX MACHINES TO SHARE PATIENT RECORDS. CALIFORNIA MUST DO BETTER. S. CI YOU BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER FOR THE STATE O SHARE DATA AT SCALE WE MUST HAVE BROAD PARTICIPATION. WITHOUT A MANDATE IN PLACE THERE ARE A TO MANY REASONS FOR- HOSPITALS AND HEALTH PLANS TO NOT SHARE THE DATA UNIVERSALLY. SO WE WIND UP WITH THAT INADEQUATE PATCHWORK OF THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE TODAY. FOR US WE KNOW INFORMATION IS POWER FRONT LINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE PANDEMIC SINCE DAY ONE- COULD UTILIZE HIV TO MAKE CERTAIN THE HEALTH CARE TEAMS UP ACCURATE REAL TIME INFORMATION. ABOUT THEIR PATIENTS. A STATE Y. H. I. E. NEEDS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO PROVIDERS. OF BURST AND COMPREHENSIVE UNIFIED RECORD SO CARE TEAMS CAN- CAN KNOW AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ABOUT EVERY SITUATION THEY'RE WALKING INTO. IF A PATIENT COMES INTO ANY HEALTHCARE SETTING OUR CARE TEAM MEMBERS DESERVE TO KNOW IF THAT PATIENTS TESTED POSITIVE FOR COKE WITH NINETEEN. SO THAT ARE. SO THAT PROPER PRECAUTIONS CAN BE TAKEN. FRONTLINE WORKERS NEED TO KNOW THEIR PATIENTS AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS MUST HAVE READILY AVAILABLE DATA. ON HANDS THAT SO THEY CAN DO THEIR JOBS MORE EFFECTIVELY. IN HEALTHCARE GAPS IN PATIENT DATA HAVE- CAN HAVE DISASTROUS IMPACTS ESPECIALLY DURING AN EMERGENCY. EVERY GAP IN DATA MAKES IT HARDER FOR SEIU MEMBERS ARE FRONTLINE WORKERS TO DO THEIR JOB. AND MANY OTHER STATES HAVE SHOWN THE ABILITY FOR H. ID'S TO SUPPORT THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD FOLLOW SUIT. I'M IN WITH REGARD TO THE SECOND QUESTION ABOUT HOW- ANY SHOW YOU CAN UTILIZE THAT TO HELP THE STATE DIDN'T FIND BEGIN TO ELIMINATE HEALTH DISPARITIES YOU THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IN QUEST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ON THE PANEL- AS WE HAVE SEEN DURING THE PANDEMIC PEOPLE OF COLOR- IN THOSE AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE REALLY BEARING THE BRUNT OF THIS PANDEMIC AND FRANKLY. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT- WE EVEN HAVE ACCURATE SENSE OF HOW BAD THINGS REALLY ARE. YOU CANNOT BEGIN TO MAKE A GOOD FAITH GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO ADDRESS HEALTH CARE INEQUITIES IF YOU DON'T HAVE A TRUE PICTURE OF WHERE THE EXISTING HOW PROFOUND THEY ARE. S. YEAH YOU BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT A ROBUST STATE WHITE EACH IT CAN HELP THE STATE MOVE THE NEEDLE ON EQUITY. AND THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS WE MUST CONSIDER AS THIS POLICY AND FINANCES. HEALTHCARE SERVICES HEALTH INSURERS AND PROVIDERS MUST BE REQUIRED TO COLLECT RACE AND ETHNICITY DATA ON THEIR MEMBERS AND PATIENCE AND SUBMIT THAT INFORMATION TO THE H. I. T. H. I. E. SHOULD MAINTAIN THIS INFORMATION IN A MASTER PATIENT INDEX. AND MUST HAVE THE ABILITY TO MEASURE TRACK AND REPORT ON A RANGE OF- STANDARD ACCESS QUALITY AND OUTCOME MEASURES THAT. ARE STRATIFIED BY RACE AND ETHNICITY. WE SHOULD REQUIRE THE STATEY. H. TO PRODUCE AN ANNUAL EQUITY REPORT FOR POLICY MAKERS ON THE AGENCY ARE. ON THE AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY. INDICATORS AND ON THE IN C. Q. EIGHT HEALTH EFFECTIVENESS DATA INFORMATION SAT ALSO KNOWN AS HE DOES. SORTED BY RACE ETHNICITY THAT IS BROKEN DOWN BY PROVIDER AND REGION. THE H. I. T. SHOULD HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ELECTRONICALLY EXCHANGE HEALTH AND INFORMATION WITH THE HEALTH CARE PAYMENTS DATABASE. AND I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE- AS I MENTIONED THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT FIRST TWO QUESTIONS- THAT REALLY SHINE A LIGHT ON THE REASONS THAT AND EACH ARE YOU SHOULD BE CONSTRUCTING CALIFORNIA THAT NOT ONLY IMPROVES COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PLANS AND PROVIDERS TO BETTER COORDINATE CARE FOR PATIENTS. BUT ALSO FOR THE STATE- SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE REAL VALUE FOR OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND INFORM OUR POLICY MAKERS TO TACKLE ISSUES LIKE- HEALTHEQUITY WHICH IS SO VITAL- TO CALIFORNIA IN OUR FUTURE- IMPORTANTLY MOVING TO THE SECOND. TO THE THIRD QUESTION- WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO ESTABLISH- DATA EXCHANGES ACROSS HEALTH CARE SOCIAL SERVICES PROVIDERS THAT ENABLES A POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND FUTURE PATIENT CENTERED. COORDINATION THE VULNERABLE PATIENT POPULATIONS WE TALKED ABOUT- PREVIOUSLY ALSO STAND TO BENEFIT THE MOST FROM ADVANCES IN PATIENT HEALTH MANAGEMENT WE KNOW THAT AND WE HAVE KNOWN FOR SOME TIME THE HIGHEST RISK IN ROWLEY'S A MEDIC CAL HAVE MULTIPLE NEEDS AND WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT FROM A SYSTEM. THAT NOT ONLY INTEGRATES PHYSICAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BUT THAT LOOKS ACROSS THE CONTINUUM OF SERVICES AVAILABLE FROM VARIOUS STATE AND COUNTY DEPARTMENTS IT CAN UNIFORMLY. ASSESS A PERSON'S INDIVIDUAL NEEDS. THERE IS BEEN A LONG STANDING ISSUE AS IT RELATES TO THE SHARING OF DATA FROM BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS MOSTLY DUE TO THE I'M- UNEXPLAINABLE STIGMA THAT WE HAVE ATTACHED TO BE A RURAL HEALTH. BECAUSE THERE IS A LACK OF CLARITY ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INFORMATION CAN BE SHARED. IT IS TIME FOR THE STATE TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP ON THIS FRONT SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THAT SO THAT PROVIDERS CAN FEEL COMFORTABLE EXCHANGING INFORMATION THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO MANAGING THE INDIVIDUAL'S CARE. AT THE VERY LEAST WE SHOULD USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DEFINE A MINIMUM SET OF DATA THAT SHOULD BE SHARED ACROSS SOCIAL AND TRADITIONAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. RATING SYSTEM THAT MANAGES WHOLE PERSON CARE AND SIMPLIFIES ELIGIBILITY FOR STATE AND COUNTY PROGRAMS ACROSS DEPARTMENTS CAN UNLOCK THE FULL POTENTIAL OF HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES. THAT THE VOTE WAS THAT NEED CARE THE MOST ARE ABLE TO ACCESS IT. AND IF WE BILL CALIFORNIA'S HIV TO CERTAIN- MEDICAID FUNCTION. WE CAN ALSO LEVERAGE- HUGE AMOUNTS OF FEDERAL DOLLARS TO HELP PAY FOR IT. FINALLY POLICIES ARE BACK CALIFORNIA CAN ENACT TO LEVERAGE THE PROGRESS MADE THROUGH THESE NETWORKS- AT. BUT I'LL BE MORE INCLUSIVE AND ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA H. ID SYSTEM SERVE ALL OF CALIFORNIANS AND PROVIDE SERVICES THAT ADDRESS THE WHOLE PERSON IN RESPONSE TO THAT QUESTION IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHAT POLICIES THE STATE SHOULD PURSUE- WE MUST FIRST DETERMINE WHAT THE STATE'S GOALS ARE. IF THE ONLY GOAL IS TO FACILITATE EXCHANGE BETWEEN PROVIDERS PLANS TO BETTER COORDINATE PATIENT CARE WHICH IS GREAT WE ARE BUT WE MUST ALSO ENSURE THAT- WE ARE REALLY MOVING THE NEEDLE ON EQUITY. ON MEDICAL TRANSFORMATION I'M BOLSTERING OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE IN ON RESPONDING TO COVERT NINETEEN ANOTHER PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES SO THAT WE CAN QUICKLY CLOSE EXISTING DATA GAPS MYSTICS SWIFT AND DECISIVE ACTION TO STYLE H. ID- IN SA USE VIEW THE MOST IMPORTANT POLICIES NEEDED TO ACCOMPLISH THIS BROAD SET. OF GOALS ARE- ESTABLISHING US SHARING MANDATE SIMILAR TO WHAT WAS CONTAINED IN THE GOVERNOR'S. BUDGET PROPOSAL- IN REQUIRING HEALTH PLANS PROVIDERS TO COLLECT AND SHARE RACE AND ETHNICITY DATA. CREATE A STATEWIDE HIV THAT LEVERAGES PREVIOUS INVESTMENTS IN HEALTH INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE- AND IS ABLE TO SUPPORT THE STATE'S PUBLIC HEALTH GOALS. ENSURED HIV HAS THE ABILITY TO MEASURE TRACK AND REPORT ON A RANGE OF ACCESS QUALITY OUTCOME MEASURES THAT ARE STRATIFIED BY RACE AND ETHNICITY. AND THAT THEY PRODUCE AN ANNUAL ACT REPORT FOR POLICY MAKERS AND THEN FINALLY TO CREATE H. ID IN A MANNER THAT UTILIZE AVAILABLE FEDERAL RESOURCES TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. WITHOUT I ONCE AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE THE TIME AND- I WILL STAY ON FOR ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH HE WHOLE PANEL AND THEN WE'LL ASK QUESTIONS SO I HOPE YOU CAN STAY WITH US THERE SO. THANK YOU- NEXT WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM. THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND I BELIEVE IT'S GONNA BE DORIS- GREEN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. HI GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU- MY NAME IS DELORES SCREEN I NEED THAT I COULD'VE DIRECTOR WITH THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. AND I THE FIRST QUESTION THAT I'VE BEEN ASKED TO ADDRESS IS HOW CAN CALIFORNIA DEVELOP AN H. I EAT POLICY THAT BEST SUPPORT STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES IN THEIR EFFORTS TO RESPOND TO CURRENT AND FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH. EMERGENCIES ONE OF MY BIGGEST CONCERNS AND ONE OF OUR BIGGEST COLLECTIVE OPPORTUNITIES IS TO SUPPORT AND LEVERAGE THE PHYSICIAN PRACTICES THAT ARE THE BACKBONE OF HEALTHCARE IN CALIFORNIA. THESE PRACTICES HAVE STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR PATIENTS THEY ARE IDEALLY POSITIONED TO REACH OUT TO VULNERABLE PATIENTS TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE VACCINATED. AND HELP PATIENTS CATCH UP ON MISSED PREVENTATIVE AND CHRONIC DISEASE CARE THIS IS PUBLIC HEALTH. IN MY COMMUNITY I'VE SEEN HOW IMPORTANT H. I EAT DATA AND TOOLS ARE TOO SMALL PRACTICES PLAYING THIS ROLE. THE HIV ALERT PROJECT ALERTS PRACTICES RECEIVED ONE OF PATIENTS TEST POSITIVE FOR COBIT NINETY. POSITIONS USE THE H. I. E. TO IDENTIFY HIGH RISK PATIENTS THAT SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED FOR VACCINATION AND DESPITE MISSING PREVENTATIVE CARE HAVE INCOMPLETE DATA IS ESSENTIAL I'LL GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES OF HOW WE UTILIZE OUR H. I. E. AT THE BEGINNING OF BECAUSE OF IT AND NOW DURING THE VACCINATION PROCESS. AT THE BEGINNING OF CODE WHEN THE GOVERNOR ISSUED THE STAY AT HOME ORDER WE KNEW WE NEEDED TO GET THAT MESSAGE OUT TO OUR OUR ELDERLY PATIENTS. AND THE PATIENTS THAT WERE OF MOST SAID AT RISK. AND SO WE DEVELOPED A LIST OF ABOUT TWENTY FIVE CHRONIC CONDITIONS OF HIGH- FOR HIGH RISK PATIENTS AND WE ASKED OUR LOCAL H. I EAT TO RUN AS A LIST OF ALL PATIENTS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. THAT MET THAT CRITERIA- THEY WERE. IN TWO DAYS TO COME BACK WITH US WITH A LIST OF SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND PATIENTS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY THAT WERE HIGH RISK WE THEN- WITH OUR FOR A COUPLE OF OUR PHYSICIANS. RECORDED A PSA A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH THAT DAN WAS SENT OUT- TO. ELECTRONICALLY OBVIOUSLY TO THE SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND PATIENTS ADVISING THEM TO STAY AT HOME IF THEY HAD TO GO OUT THE CUPBOARDS OR BASED MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCE X. CETERA WITHOUT THE H. I. E. WE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND PATIENTS. IN ALMOST FORTY EIGHT LESS THAN. FORTY EIGHT HOURS TO GET OUR MESSAGE OUT. WE RECENTLY- I WOULD. WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND WE NEEDED TO IDENTIFY- A PATIENTS THAT WERE OVER SEVENTY FIVE OVER SIXTY FIVE AND THEN UNDER SIXTY FIVE THAT AGAIN HAD MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS TO ENCOURAGE THOSE AND GET THESE PATIENTS IN TO GET THEIR VACCINE SO WE WENT BACK TO OUR H. I. E. WE ASK- FOR- THEM TO IDENTIFY ALL PATIENTS WHO HAD BEEN RELEASED FROM- AREA HOSPITALS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. THEY HAD TO WERE OVER THESE AGE BANDS AND AGAIN WITH THE AND JUST A FEW DAYS WE WERE ABLE TO GET THAT INFORMATION AND THEN WE WERE ABLE TO THROUGH THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM CONTACT THOSE PATIENTS AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO COME IN FOR THEIR THEIR FOR THEIR VACCINE WITHOUT A ROBUST H. I EAT- WE WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO DO THIS TYPE OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SO HAVE- IN- HOW CAN WE REPLICATE THIS FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH HERE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE HERE'S WHAT I WOULD DO NEARLY A 100% OF THE HOSPITALS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE FOR PARTICIPATING IN OUR H. I. E. PARTICIPATION REALLY SPED UP WHEN OUR LARGEST- LOCAL HEALTH PLAN ESTABLISHED FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR H. I EAT PARTICIPATION AND DATA SHARING. TO GET UNIVERSAL PARTICIPATION WE WILL NEED TO BUILD BUILD ON SUCCESSFUL MODELS LIKE THE ONE WE DEVELOPED HERE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. A STATE WIDE H. I. E. NEEDS TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE DATA AND TOOLS FOR PRACTICES WHICH DOES INCLUDE ALERTS SO ALERTS MEANS- WHEN A PATIENT IS ADMITTED- OR GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM OR IS DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN KNOWS ABOUT THAT IF THEY HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN THE HOSPITAL AND THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO GET THEIR PATIENTS IN IN A TIMELY MANNER TO PROVIDE FOLLOW UP CARE SO THEY'RE NOT READMITTED. ALSO ANALYTICS TOOLS THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO RUN POPULATION HEALTH TYPE OF REPORTS ON ALL OF THEIR PATIENTS NOT JUST A ONE ON ONE BASIS. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THEY NEED COMPREHENSIVE UNIFIED RECORDS THAT CONTAINS ALL THE pMATTER WHERE THAT PATIENT RECEIVES THEIR CARE. AND LASTLY HIV ACCESS SHOULD BE FREE WE ARE VERY LOW LOW COST FOR SMALL PRACTICES SMALL PRACTICES CANNOT ABSORB LARGE IT AND- CLASS IN ORDER TO RECEIVE INFORMATION ON THEIR PATIENTS. THE NEXT QUESTION HOW CAN H. I. E. BE UTILIZED TO HELP THE STATE IDENTIFY AND BEGIN TO ELIMINATE HEALTH DISPARITIES THAT CONTINUE TO IMPACT FAR TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU CAN I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS ON THE CRITICAL ROLE OF SMALL PRACTICES AND MAKING SURE EVERY PERSON IN CALIFORNIA HAS EQUITABLE ACCESS TO NEEDED HEALTH CARE INCLUDING THE VACCINES. ONE OF THE TRENDS WE ARE SEEING IS THAT COVERT ACCION'S ARE BEING DELIVERED OUT MARCH COMMUNITY SITES NOT A PHYSICIAN OFFICES. THIS MEANS THAT PRACTICES ARE COMPLETELY IN THE DARK ABOUT THEIR PATIENTS JACKSON NATION STATUS DOCTORS CAN LOOK AT PATIENTS VACCINATION STATUS ONE OTHER TIME OF THE VACCINATION REGISTRY BUT FOR OBVIOUS REASONS THIS IS NOT FEASIBLE- FOR BUSY PRACTICES. I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE MODEL IN MARYLAND WHERE THE H. I. E. PROVIDES DAILY VACCINATION REPORT SEGMENTED BY AGE RACE AND GEOGRAPHY TO PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE. THE H. I. E. RECEIVES A DAILY VACCINATION DATA FILE FROM THE STATE REGISTRY AND THEN MATCHES IT UP WITH THE PATIENT LESS HE H. I. E. ALREADY HAS FOR EACH PROVIDER. PROVIDERS GET A DAILY REPORT OF ALL OF THEIR PATIENTS VACCINATION STATUS. ADDRESSING DISPARITIES WILL TAKE A LOT OF PROACTIVE OUTREACH FROM TRUSTED ADVISORS THOSE TRUSTED ADVISORS ARE ARE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. ROW AFTER ROW REJECT THEM POSSIBLE WITHOUT INFORMATION AND THE INSIDE PROVIDERS NEED UNIFIED RECORDS THAT COMBINE INFORMATION FROM A PATIENT'S HEALTH PLAN AND ALL OF THEIR PROVIDERS NO MATTER WHERE THEY SEEK THEIR CARE. THEY NEED TOOLS TO IDENTIFY SUBSETS OF THEIR PATIENTS BASED ON RACE GEOGRAPHY AND THAT PREVENTED IT NEEDS VACCINATION STATUS. ALL THE INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS CAN PROVIDE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURETO MEET THESE NEEDS THE STATE WIDE H. I. E. SHOULD BE THE PLATFORM THAT COMBINES CLAIMS AND CLINICAL DATA TO PRODUCE A UNIFIED VIEW OF PATIENTS HEALTH. AND PROVIDE ANALYTIC TOOLS TO SUPPORT PROACTIVE OUTREACH AND POPULATION HEALTH. THE NEXT QUESTION WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO ESTABLISH DATA EXCHANGE ACROSS HEALTHCARE AND SOCIAL SERVICES THAT ENABLES POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PATIENT CENTERED CARE COORDINATION. IT'S IMPORTANT TO LAY OUT A STRATEGY FOR EXCHANGE ACROSS A PHYSICAL BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. BUT I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO LOSE SIGHT OF HOW FAR WE ARE TODAY FROM WIDESPREAD INFORMATION SHARING JUST AMONG HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND PLANS WHERE WE ALREADY HAVE WORKABLE H. I. E. MODELS AND SUPPORT OF POLICIES THROUGH YEP UP. BUT AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS OF EFFORTS AND MILLIONS OF FEDERAL AND STATE DOLLARS EXPANDED WE STILL HAVE A FRAGMENTED SYSTEM. WHERE DATA CANNOT MOVE EASILY BETWEEN REGIONAL H. I. EASE THE NATIONAL EXCHANGE NETWORKS AND STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. SO AS WE EXPAND THE SCOPE OF WHAT WE ARE CONSIDERING WE NEED TO BE DRIVEN BY BOTH URGENCY AND PRAGMATISM WE DON'T HAVE A HUNDRED OR EVEN TEN YEARS TO FIGURE THIS OUT. LET'S SET A GOAL THAT ALL HEALTH FOR HEALTH PROVIDERS AND PLANS PARTICIPATE IN HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE. SHARE NEEDED DATA WITHIN THE NEXT FEW YEARS OUR PHYSICIANS CANNOT PROVIDE BETTER CARE TO PATIENTS WITHOUT A FULL VIEW OF THE PATIENT'S RECORD. AND THEIR HELP. BUT AT THE SAME TIME LET'S PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AND BASECAMP LIMITATION SO EVEN THE SMALLEST PROVIDER CAN PARTICIPATE WITHOUT HARDSHIP. LET'S DEFINE A MINIMUM SET OF DATA THAT SHOULD BE SHARED ACROSS SOCIAL AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND VIABLE WORKFLOWS TO SUPPORT THIS EXCHANGE. AND LASTLY LET'S ELIMINATE THE POLICY MURKINESS THAT OFTEN SLOWS PROGRESS IN THIS AREA. AND THE LAST QUESTION WHAT POLICIES CAN CALIFORNIA ENACTED LEVERAGE THE PROGRESS MADE THROUGH THESE NETWORKS BUT BE MORE INCLUSIVE ENGINE AND ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S H. I. E. SYSTEM SERVE ALL CALIFORNIANS AND PROVIDE SERVICES THAT ADDRESS THE WHOLE PERSON. EARLIER I POINTED OUT THAT IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN PUBLIC HEALTH IMPROVE CARE AND ADDRESS DISPARITIES PROVIDERS IMPLANTS NEED INSIGHTS ABOUT WHICH PATIENTS ARE HIGH RISK WHICH PATIENTS NEED PREVENTATIVE CARE. WHICH PATIENTS REQUIRE FOLLOW UP IN WHICH PATIENTS ARE NOT YET VACCINATED. THESE QUESTIONS CANNOT BE ANSWERED WITH THE DATA IN ONE EHR- ONE HEALTH PLANS CLAIMS THEY REQUIRE ASSEMBLING DATA FROM MANY SOURCES AND DISTILLING INSIGHTS THAT IS WHAT IS STATE DATA EXCHANGE INFRASTRUCTURE SHOULD ACCOMPLISH. SOME LARGE HEALTH SYSTEMS HAVE THE DATA TEAMS AND TOOLS TO ACCOMPLISH THIS ON THEIR OWN. BUT MOST PROVIDERS DO NOT HAVE THE DATA INFRASTRUCTURE- TOOLS THEY NEED. SOME TWO THINGS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN. ONE WE NEED EVERYONE TO SHARE THE CORE SET OF DATA WAS SHARED INCLUDES CLAIMS PATIENT SUMMARIES AT T. MESSAGES WHICH- ADMIT THIS CHARGING TRANSFER. AND TEST RESULTS THAT ARE NEEDED FOR BETTER PATIENT CARE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THE FEDERAL INFORMATION BLOCKING AND PATIENT ACCESS ROLES ARE MOVING US IN THIS DIRECTION NOW CALIFORNIA SHOULD TAKE UP THE CAUSE AND BUILD ON THOSE EFFORTS. WE ALSO NEED A ROBUST DATA INFRASTRUCTURE AND POWERFUL POPULATION HEALTH TOOLS AVAILABLE TO ALL PROVIDERS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. DID YOU THIS WITH URGENCY OF PRAGMATISM WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT SIX TODAY WHERE ARE THE GAPS AND WHAT'S THE MOST RAPID AND PRAGMATIC WAY TO FILL THOSE GAPS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE AND WILL WILL HAVE QUESTIONS I HOPE YOU CAN STICK AROUND. AND YES THANK YOU THANK YOU. WILL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT- OUR NEXT PANELIST- FROM THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IS DAVID WARD THE VICE PRESIDENT OF HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MISTER FORD. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE FIRST RECENTLY I'M MORE THAN A YEAR WELL HI. AND YOU CONSIDER THE QUESTIONS AT YOUR STOP LOSSES TO ADDRESS AND- THIS IS THE BEST PLACE TO GET STARTED HERE. IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES NOT AND NOW WE IT'S A FOR. A CHINESE THE ACTION THE POSITION PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS HEALTH PLANS AND OTHERS ENGAGING WHEN THEY TRANSPORTATION DATA. WHAT WE TRADITIONALLY REFERRED TO AS AN H. IDEAS MORE PROPERLY CALLED H. I. L. HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATION. AND H. I. L. IS ONLY ONE METHOD THAT PHYSICIANS AND OTHER PROVIDERS USED TO GAUGE IN H. I. E. THERE ARE ALSO IN THE NATIONAL NETWORKS SUCH AS CAREQUALITY AND COMMON WELL. AND THEN WITH THE COMING OF THE IN THE COMING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FEDERAL INFORMATION BLOCKING RULE THE PATIENT ACCESS ROLE. WE'RE GOING TO SEE THE RISE OF PATIENT DRIVEN OUT THE STATE EXCHANGE. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THOSE CONTACTS AS WE APPROACH SETTING HIV POLICY STATE. WE UNFORTUNATELY OFTEN ACCEPT AS TRUTH THE PROVIDERS DON'T DO ANY CHARITY WHAT WE NEED IS THAT THEY MAY NOT- FOR DISSIPATE IN H. I. L. BUT THEY MAY BE EXCHANGING A WHOLE LOT OF DATA USING OTHER METHODS. AND ANY SOLUTION WE WOULD BUILD THE STATE HAS TO BE INCLUSIVE AS ALL THE CHECK OF LL OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES AS WELL AS THE NEW ONES. COMING ONLINE. NO IT'S ALSO TRUE HOWEVER THAT THE ROLE OF HIV IN THE STATE BEEN. ON THE PHONE. AS OF THE PREVIOUS SPOKE SO WELL TO. MANY SMALLER UNDERSERVED AND RURAL PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN LEFT ACT. OTHERS EITHER BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A HIGHER FROM CAN BE HR'S WHICH ALLOW THEM TO GET ON TO THE NATIONAL NETWORKS. THEY LACK THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT TO CONNECT TO AN HMO OR THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO BROADBAND. INTERNET THAT CAN SUPPORT EXCHANGE. ABOUT THREE YEAR AGO. CNN LARGE COALITION OF OTHERS WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO BUILD A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM. FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF WHICH WAS FEDERAL. KNOWN AS CAL HOCKLEY CALIFORNIA H. IT ONBOARDING PROGRAM. THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HELP RESOLVE THIS ISSUE AND BRING HELP BRING THE SMALLER PROVIDERS INTO THE FOLD. UNFORTUNATELY THREE YEARS LATER THAT PROGRAM HAS ONLY SPENT ON A FRACTION OF ITS ALLOTMENT. ANDREAS ALMOST OUT OF TIME. THE OTHER ESSENTIAL PIECE OF THIS CONTACT OF CONTACTS THIS DISCUSSION WHICH I. MENTIONED VERY BRIEFLY AND AS TO THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER. IS BETWEEN FEDERAL REGULATIONS SET TO TAKE EFFECT THIS YEAR THE INFORMATION BLOCKING RULE WHICH COMES IN APRIL AND THE PATIENT ACCESS ROLE WHICH COMES IN JULY. TAKEN TOGETHER THESE TWO ROLES MARKET SHIFTING DIRECTION IN THE WORLD OF THE JD. ONCE THEY ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED ALL ACTORS IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SO THAT PHYSICIANS HEALTH PLANS HOSPITALS AND OTHERS. ARE GOING TO BE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES IF THEY ATTEMPT TO IMPEDE THE FLOW OF PATIENT DATA. SO ANYTHING WE DO IN CALIFORNIA HAS. HAD ALL OF THAT AS A BACKDROP. WITH ALL THE IN MIND INTO A DRASTIC DREADED BUT IT CAN BE SENATE VOTED TO SAY CALIFORNIA SHE TO. MAJOR THANK- AND FOR SINCE IT'S BEEN. IN SEVERAL ON- SO THAT ARE HELD WITHIN STATE- COMMITTEE STAFF AND ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT HOUSE TO STAY IN THAT RICH DATA EXCHANGE TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT. PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AS WELL AS FUTURE. HELLO HEALTH. AND REALLY THE MOST AND- THING REGION DO ABOUT CAR. IS TO MAKE THE DATA THAT'S CURRENTLY HELD AND CAL READY. IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY AND I WOULD LIKE TO ADD SECURITIES DATABASE. ANOTHER SIMILAR SOURCES ACCESSIBLE HEALTH. CARE THIS WOULD HELP TREATING PHYSICIANS TO NOW WHEN ONE OF THEIR PATIENTS FOR EXAMPLE HAS TESTED POSITIVE FOR REPORTABLE DISEASE. OR AS WE'RE DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW WHEN THEY HAVE RECEIVED THE VACCINE- THE SECOND THING THAT WE NEED TO DO. IS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO SMALL UNDERSERVED GENERAL PRACTICES OF THE COMMITTEE HAD ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT HOW HIV COULD BE USED TO ADDRESS IMPORTANT WORK OF ADDRESSING HEALTH INEQUALITIES. WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT TOPIC IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING FOR SIAMANG. THE BIGGEST THING WE CAN DO TO START OFF WITH. IS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT DATA IS FLOWING BOTH TO AND FROM THE PLACES WHERE UNDERSERVED PATIENTS ARE RECEIVING CARE- LARGELY THOSE ARE GOING TO BE SMALL PRACTICES. COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS- RURAL PROVIDERS AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT HAS MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES NOW WE NEED TO BRING ALL THOSE FOLKS INTO THE FOLD HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE- THIRD. ARE REESTABLISHED THE STATE'S ROLE AS THE FACILITATOR OF HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE. OF I DON'T WANT TO SAY ON THIS BUT JONAH FOR WORK THE FIRST PERSON WHO HELD THE POSITION OF DATA SECRETARY AND- DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY- I WAS A GOOD SPEECH OF MUCH BETTER THAN I COULD- BUT- THE POINT IS THERE USED TO BE AN ITALIAN FOR STRUCTURE THE WITH THE STAKEHOLDER. WITHIN HHS AGENCY- OVER TIME THAT INFRASTRUCTURE ATROPHIED AND NOT DISSOLVED- IT WAS NOT CONSIDERED A PRIORITY. AND WEBER WHAT HAPPENED WAS WHEN OPPORTUNITIES LIKE CAL HOP WERE DELAYED OR FACE DIFFICULTIES IT WAS REALLY UNCLEAR WHO WAS IN CHARGE- STAKEHOLDERS LIKE US TO GO TO TALK ABOUT. WHAT WAS GOING ON AND HOW TO FIX IT SO IT'S TIME TO START BRINGING BACK THAT. THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. AND FINALLY AS WE START TALKING ABOUT- THE NEW ONE MIGHT CONSIDER SOME OF THE NONTRADITIONAL SOURCES OF DATA SO FROM TERMINALS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- AS- YOU KNOW. WE REALLY DO NEED TO BE LOOKING AT ALL THE AVAILABLE FEDERAL FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES- THE CHF REPORTS THAT WERE GIVEN TO THE COMMITTEE PROVIDE SEVERAL EXCELLENT POSSIBILITIES. IS INCLUDED- WHAT'S CALLED LATER MEDICAID INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ARCHITECTURE WHICH IS A LINE OF FEDERAL FUNDING THAT PROVIDES. A 90% FEDERAL MATCH FOR BUILD OUT AND 75% FEDERAL MATCH MAINTENANCE. THERE'S MORAL BROADBAND FUNDING AT THE FCC WHICH COULD HELP FILL IN A LOT OF THE GAPS IN OUR- IN OUR INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE. AND I'LL JUST TACK ON ONE THAT HASN'T BEEN MENTIONED THAT PROCESS ASSEMBLY DOESN'T ENOUGH ATTENTION. WHICH IS TEXAS SECTION SIX ZERO ZERO ONE OF THE FEDERAL SUPPORT ACT WHICH ACTUALLY OPENS UP THE POSSIBILITY OF CREATING A MEANINGFUL USE TYPE PROGRAM FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT AS WELL. REALLY IT'S YOU KNOW ALL THESE FEDERAL DOLLARS COULD HELP US FILL IN THE GAPS IN THE SYSTEM. BRING NONTRADITIONAL PROVIDERS. AND I ONLY THAT NONTRADITIONAL IN THAT THEY HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY. PARTICIPATING HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE. BRING THEM INTO THE NETWORK AND GET THEM EXCHANGING DATA. SO WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO HANG ON FOR QUESTIONS GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SO WE HAVE NEXT- FROM THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HELP NETWORK KERRYSANDERS A SENIOR POLICY DIRECTOR. HI THERE ARE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO- ADDRESS YOU TODAY AND MY NAME IS KERRY SANDERS AND SENIOR POLICY DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK WHERE STATEWIDE MULTICULTURAL HEALTH ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO ELIMINATION OF HEALTH DISPARITIES FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR- YOU ALSO HEALTH UTILIZED TO HELP THE STATE- IDENTIFYING BEGIN TO LEMONADE HEALTH DISPARITIES THAT CONTINUE TO IMPACT PARKING MANY CALIFORNIANS. CALIFORNIA NEEDS OF COLOR INCLUDING LESBIAN GAY BISEXUAL TRANSGENDER AND QUEER INDIVIDUALS- PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES- CAN CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE DISCRIMINATION AND HAVE POOR OTCOMES ON KEY HEALTH INDICATORS INCLUDING ASTHMA DIABETES. MENTAL HEALTH AND OTHER CONDITIONS. AND THEY SAY THAT ALLOW MORE. COLLECTION A DEMO DATA A GOOD SIGNIFICANTLY HELP IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR CALIFORNIANS IN COMMERCIAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAM- BUT HOW WOULD THIS WORK WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT PREVENTABLE HOSPITAL ADMISSION RATES FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN AGES TWO TO SEVENTEEN BUT I'M NOT. IS ROUGHLY THREE AND A HALF TIMES THAT OF WHITE CHILDREN ON SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES ARE ALSO EXIST IN PREVENTABLE ADMISSIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN ADULTS SUFFERING FROM DIABETES. WHAT LONG TERM COMPLICATIONS COMPARED TO WHITE ADULT. HOSPITALS THAT HAVE RAISED AT THE FEELING WHICH INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR PATIENTS. WOULD BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY DISPARITIES WITHIN THEIR PRACTICE- AND IMPLEMENTING- DEVELOP HOW AND IN MY CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS- ADDITIONALLY WHEN LANGUAGE PREFERENCE IS AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY HOSPITAL CAN HAVE A BETTER IDEA PDATED A PATIENT NEEDS I CAN ENSURE THE AVAILABILITY OF INTERPRETATION OTHER RESOURCES. ESPECIALLY WHEN A PATIENT MIGHT REQUIRE MULTIPLE RESOURCES WITHIN A HOSPITAL SUCH AS SURGERY IMAGING PHYSICAL THERAPY- ONE AREA WHERE THIS CAN ALSO BE VERY EFFECTIVE IS WHEN A PATIENT IS READY TO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS TRANSLATED INTO LANGUAGE THAT A PATIENT UNDERSTAND CAN ENABLE PATIENTS THAT EASIER ACCESS TO IMPORTANT. HEALTH INFORMATION AND- AS WELL AS SHARING WITH PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS PHARMACISTS AND OTHERS FOR HOSPITAL FOLLOWING TREATMENT. I'M USING DEMOGRAPHIC DATA CAN ALSO HELP TO FACILITATE APPROPRIATE REFERRALS TO COMMUNITY SUPPORT SERVICES INCLUDING NUTRITION AND EXERCISE YOUR SUPPORT ADULT DAY HEALTH REHABILITATION CHILD CARE AND TRANSPORTATION- MORE BROADLY THERE ARE EFFORTS UNDERWAY TO DEVELOP ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS AND OTHER AGENCIES THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES- AND- THIS CAN ALLOW YOU KNOW. THAT THEIR GUIDELINES AND RECOMMENDATIONS ALLOW AND PATIENCE YOU. INPUT THEIR DATA FINALLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD MENTION NOT THE CODEPENDENT MAKE IN RECENT NATURAL DISASTERS THAT DEMONSTRATED. HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT HELP TO. THE CALIFORNIA LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS RESPONDING TO PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IT'S LIKE KOPEN NINETEEN OR- EARTH WILL OPERATE BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO REAL TIME DATA ON CASES THROUGH. DIRECT ACCESS TO HOSPITAL MEDICAL RECORDS- I SUPPOSED TO YOU KNOW CURRENT FAX PAPER FAX. REPORTING SYSTEMS THAT ARE IN PLACE. I WELL IT I. EFFECT POTENTIAL TO REDUCE HEALTH THIS. AS WE TO HER THE POWER OF NEW TECH. AND HEALTH WE MUST BE CAREFUL TO TEMPER POLICIES AND DESIGN SYSTEMS ROUNDING H. I. T. DIFFICULT ACCESS FOR ALL COMMUNITY AS WELL I PROTECTING CONSUMERS. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN YOU CAN PUBLISHED EQUITY IN THE DIGITAL AGE HOW HEALTH INFORMATION. TECHNOLOGY CAN REDUCE DISPARITIES. CONTAINS A NUMBER. FOR WAYS TO ENSURE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE LEAD TO HEALTH EQUITY THERE ARE STILL RELEVANT TO TODAY'S DISCUSSION I MENTIONED A FEW TODAY. THE START ARE REQUIRED THERE MUST BE A COMMITMENT AND REQUIREMENTS- FROM THE STATE AND I'LL H. I. USERS TO COMPREHENSIVE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING. BY UTILIZING THE FEDERAL TWENTY FIFTEEN OPPOSITE NATIONAL COORDINATOR FOR H. I. T. STANDARD FOR ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD. THIS INCLUDES FULL DISAGGREGATE OF RACE ETHNICITY LANGUAGE SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER IDENTITY AND DISABILITY STATUS. THE TWENTY FIFTEEN- ANTI STANDARD HOWEVER ALSO INCLUDED ON BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL RISK FACTORS INCLUDING AGE THE- ON TOPICS LIKE SOCIAL ISOLATION DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FOOD AND OR HOUSING INSECURITY WHICH HAVE ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO IMPACT HEALTH OUTCOMES. SELECTION REPORTING OF THE DATA WILL ALLOW DHS TO SET YOUR OF YOUR TARGET FOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND DISPARITIES REDUCTION- AND PROVIDE GREATER OVERSIGHT OF MANAGED CARE PLANS UNDER THE NEW POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS AND CALLING- SECOND HEALTH INFORMATION HEALTH SYSTEMS FOR HEALTH INFORMATION XCHANGES MUST BE DESIGNED FROM A NO WRONG DOOR APPROACH. H. ARE YOU CAN HELP WITH POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT THROUGH BETTER INTEGRATION OF MEDICAL RECORDS WITH. I'M EMERGING CONCEPT OF COMMUNITY INFORMATION EXCHANGES BUT INCLUDE DATA FROM HOUSING FOOD EDUCATION AND OTHER SECTORS- TO JUSTICE OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. THERE'S SOME FOUNDATION FOR THE FROM THE MOMENT SIDE WITH NO WRONG DOOR INVOLVEMENT CHANNEL- CAREFUL THOUGHT HOWEVER MUST BE GIVEN TO THE APPLICATION AND PROGRAMMING INTERFACE. OR API OF HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE BUT THAT IS CAPABLE. OF EXTRACTING ONLY THE DATA. THANK NOTHING JERRY FOR THE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORK. FOR EXAMPLE WHO'S BEEN TRAINED TO PROVIDE ADLER MEDIATION SERVICES WHICH IS AN LUIS VARGAS- IN CALAIS AND TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT WITH A PATIENT WHO MAY BE IDENTIFIED AS HAVING ASTHMA I WITHOUT ALSO YOU KNOW UNNECESSARILY ACCESSING AND DETENTION OTHER SENSITIVE INFORMATION- THIRD OF THE MONTH. I HAVE TO CHANGE MUST BE CONSUMER FRIENDLY WHILE ENSURING STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTION- MORE SPECIFICALLY IT CHANGE SHOULD BE DESIGNED TO ENSURE FULL LANGUAGE ACCESS FOR ALL CONSUMER FACING FUNCTIONS- ALLOW CONSUMERS TO REPORT OUT PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES DATA SUCH AS FROM FITBIT. YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT YOU TAKE INTO DAILY BLOOD PRESSURE READINGS TO GLUCOSE LEVELS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DIABETES- IT SHOULD BE ALLOWED IT SHOULD BE DESIGNED TO ALLOW CONSUMERS TO SEE REVIEW AND CORRECT THEIR HEALTH INFORMATION- AND TRANSPARENT AND ACCESSIBLE RECONCILIATION AND PEELED PROPERTY. IS THERE ANY CONFLICT. IT SHOULD ALSO BE DESIGNED TO ALLOW CLEAR STATE AGAIN AND FOR SHE WITH SUBJECT. WHAT AFTER. A POLICE AND OTHER COURSE WITHOUT A SPECIFIC. A COURT ORDER SUBPOENA OR AND- YOU KNOW OTHER AGREEMENT- AND SHOULD HAVE CLEAR EASY TO UNDERSTAND PATIENT CONSENT FOR SHARING OF INFORMATION PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION SUCH AS INFORMATION ON MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE- SERVICES. FINALLY I'M MORE GENERALLY. THEY TELL YOU MUST BE BROAD INCLUSIVE AND OPEN TO ALL AND THE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE MUST BE GNOSTIC ABOUT- THE PLAN OR PROVIDER IS- THERE ARE A LOT OF EXISTING PRIVATE CLOTHES COULD. NOT FORM- AND MUST BE ACCEPTABLE TO ALL SECTORS INCLUDING PUBLIC PURCHASERS IN SAFETY NET PROVIDERS. PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT GIVEN THE DEGREE OF CHURN BETWEEN COVER CALIFORNIA MEDIKAL. EVERYONE MUST BE BROUGHT INTO THE EXCHANGE EVEN INTEGRATED HEALTH SYSTEMS LIKE KAISER- WHICH HAVE THEIR OWN INTERNAL NETWORK- AND IT MUST INCLUDE OTHER EXCHANGE FACTORS INCLUDING LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WHO. HAS NOT SHARED AFTERMATH YOU MUST BE ADEQUATELY FUNDED ENOUGH TO CABLE DURING THE DESIGN. OF THE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE. IT NOT OFTEN BY YOUR- SO. PUBLIC HEALTH TO CAN CAN REAL TIME JOB ARE DOWN OF THE BREAK. WILL ALSO BE ABLE UTILIZE THE HEALTH. EXCHANGE SEND A PUBLIC HEALTH ALERT BACK YOU PROVIDERS TO WARN THEM OF AN IMPENDING OUTBREAK- I'M- THAT. CENTURY BUT THOSE ARE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WE THANK YOU AGAIN FOR INVITING US TO SHARE OUR PERSPECTIVES ON THIS CRITICAL TOPIC. MOVING FORWARD WE SUPPORT THE RECOMMENDATIONS- BY JOHN OF THE THERAPY A STRONG PART. AND IF I REPORT TO HELP WITH THE TO THE DESIGN OF HIV AND WE WOULD ADD THAT THERE SHOULD BE STRONG PARTICIPATION BY CONSUMERS. ADVOCATE AND EXPERT ON EQUITY- YOU ENSURE THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE HIV. I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION AND THANK YOU AGAIN. FOR INVITING US TO SHARE OUR PERSPECTIVE. THE YOU VERY MUCH. I WILL GO AHEAD MOVE ONTO OUR- PAM- IN LINDEN HEALTH PLAN. JARROD NOT. A CHAU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN WEBER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER SOME COMMENTS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF EXPANDING THE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND PARTICIPATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA- I AM THE CEO HERE AT- INLAND EMPIRE HEALTH PLAN THE LOCAL INITIATIVE MEDICAL HELP PLAN WHICH COORDINATES AND PROVIDES CARE FOR MORE THAN ONE POINT THREE MILLION MEDICARE MEMBERS. IN RIVERSIDE AND SAN BENITO COUNTIES AND I H. P. ACTUALLY HELP TO CREATE OUR OWN HIV AND ELLEN HIGHER BACK IN TWENTY TEN AND OUR REGIONAL HIV MERGED WITH CALENDAR JACKSON TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH CREATED MANIFEST MAX WHICH I ALSO SIT ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR. AND MANIFESTATION MIGHT KNOW IS THE NONPROFIT STATEWIDE HEALTH INFORMATION NETWORK ORGANIZATION THAT FACILITATES INFORMATION SHARING ACROSS MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING NINETY SIX HOSPITALS AND- SEVEN HEALTH PLANS INCLUDING US HERE AT OUR H. P. AND I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS CEO OF THIS FANTASTIC ORGANIZATION SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN BUT PRIOR HELD. SEVERAL LEADERSHIP AND EXECUTIVE ROLES FOR HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS FALL HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND IN THE MIDWEST. AND IF MY TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF SERVICE AND HEALTH CARE FIELD HAS TAUGHT ME ANYTHING IT IS THAT WITHOUT TIMELY TIMELY ACCESS TO ALL AVAILABLE DATA FOR PATIENT. PROVIDING CARE TO THE PATIENTS WHOLE PERSON CANNOT BE ACHIEVED. NOW IMAGINE WITH ME FOR JUST A MOMENT. THAT YOU PURCHASE ONE OF THOSE SPECIAL CREDIT GIFT CARDS LIKE ONE OF THOSE VISA GIFT CARDS. OR A LOVED ONE AT A NATIONAL RETAILER MAYBE LIKE TARGETS AND YOU'RE EXCITED ABOUT BEING ABLE TO MAIL THAT DECENT GIFT CARD TO YOUR LOVED ONE WHO HAPPENS TO LIVE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA WHERE I WAS BORN AND RAISED SO THEY CAN USE. THE LOCAL GAS STATION BUT IT DOESN'T WORK AND WHEN THEY CALL THE NUMBER ON THE BACK OF THE CARD IT SAYS YOUR NETWORK DOESN'T ALLOW FOR DATA SHARING WITH GAS STATIONS THAT ONLY ALLOWS FOR RETAILERS LIKE TARGET SINCE YOU PURCHASED IT AT A RETAILER. SO YOU CAN USE THAT- IS THE CAR MAYBE AT NORDSTROM'S ALL WALMART OR ANY RETAILER BUT YOU CAN'T USE THE CARD AT GAS STATIONS RESTAURANTS OR ANYWHERE ELSE. NOW WE WOULD NEVER IMAGINE THAT KIND OF REALITY IN TODAY'S MARKETPLACE DESPITE ADVANCES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS TRANSFORMED INDUSTRIES AROUND THE WORLD JUST LIKE OUR EXAMPLE OF THE SPECIAL CREDIT GIFT CARD. IN THE HEALTH CARE SPACE PATIENT RECORDS ARE STILL OFTEN SILO BY EACH HEALTH SYSTEM OF PHARMACY LAB INDEPENDENT PHYSICIAN AND HEALTH PLAN JUST LIKE THE UNIMAGINABLE THOUGHT OF THAT GIFT CARD EXAMPLE MAKING THE DELIVERY. OF INFORMED CARE AT BEST INEFFICIENT AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS DATA STYLING SHOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE FOR CALIFORNIA AND IT CERTAINLY IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR US HERE I EACH P. AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. I H. P. IS INVESTED TREMENDOUS RESOURCES AND COLLABORATIVE ENERGY AND BUILDING OUT THE REGIONAL H. I. INFRASTRUCTURE AND INCENTIVIZING CONTRACTED PROVIDERS AND HOSPITALS PARTICIPATING THE END OF THE H. ID NETWORK AND IT IS BECAUSE OF THESE INVESTMENTS AND EFFORTS AND THE LESSONS LEARNED. THAT I BELIEVE WE HAVE A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON NOT ONLY HOW TO IDENTIFY AND OVERCOME THE BARRIERS TO HIV PARTICIPATION. BUT CAN ALSO SPEAK TO HOW THE CHINESE BREAK DOWN DATA SILOS TO ALLOW PROVIDERS THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO WORK WITH THEIR PATIENTS TO ACHIEVE POSITIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. NOW I FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS THAT DIFFICULT TO DISCUSS ANYTHING RELATED TO HEALTH CARE TODAY WITHOUT TOUCHING ON COBIT NINETEEN AND THE- INCREDIBLE IMPACT THE VIRUS CONTINUES TO OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY. AND WHAT THE VIRUSES TAKEN TOO MANY FROM US- IT IS MY HOPE THAT IS THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN PARTNERSHIP. WITH COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE AND YOU DON'T VALUE DOLLAR. AND ADMINISTER CARBON BACK. BRIGHTER DAY ARE AT. HOWEVER THE ISSUE OF DATA SILO CONTINUES TO PROCESS AND WE'RE SEEING THAT FIRST HAND AS THE VACCINATION EFFORT PLAYS OUT. AND WHILE I H. P. AND HEALTH PLANS ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE EFFORTS THAT ARE PARTNERS AND FRIENDS AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES ARE MAKING A PROVIDING WEEKLY DATA SUBMISSIONS TO PLANS ON. MEMBERS RECEIVED THEIR VACCINES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE DOSAGES DELAYS IN RECEIVING THESE DATA FEEDS PROCESSED. THIS DATA IS SO IMPORTANT ENSURING THAT HEALTH PLANS LIKE I H. P. CAN ASSIST THEIR MEMBERS. BY PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION TO VACCINE SCIENCE AND OUT REACHING TO THEM TO ENSURE THEY UNDERSTAND WHEN IT'S THEIR TURN WHERE TO GO. AND REMIND THEM TO RECEIVE SECOND SHOTS. THE UTILITY OF THIS INFORMATION WOULD BE EXPONENTIALLY GREATER FAXING DATA WAS AVAILABLE WITHOUT THE DELAY. THEREFORE IT IS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHERS IN THE STATE CONSIDER OF PRESENT AND FUTURE HIV POLICY DALY PATIENT DATA FEEDS ST TRINIAN'S FROM RELEVANT STATE AGENCIES ESPECIALLY DURING PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES. MUST BE A PRIORITY. THIS WILL GREATLY ASSIST IN TRACKING AND FORECASTING HOSPITAL CAPACITY AND I DID TO FIND RISK PATIENTS THAT NEED AN EXTRA LEVEL OF. PROACTIVE OUTREACH. NOW LOOKING PAST THE PANDEMIC I'M HOPEFUL FOR THE FUTURE OF MEDIC CALLOUS NATIONALLY WHEN CONSIDERING THE OPPORTUNITY THAT CALTRAIN COULD PROVIDE PLANS AND PROVIDERS. TO BETTER TACKLE HEALTH DISPARITIES THAT HAVE ONLY GROWN DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. AND TO PROVIDE TRUE WHOLE PERSON CARE TO BENEFICIARIES WITHIN THE RESOURCES PROPOSED. UNDER THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT- ECM AND IN LIEU OF SERVICES FOR IOS PROPOSALS. NOW WHILE I KNOW FIRST HAND THAT OUR TEAM BY H. P. IS WORKING NONSTOP TO PREPARE TO IMPLEMENT ECM AND I ALL OF US. IN TWENTY TWENTY TO MUCH OF THE SUCCESS OF CALAMP WILL ULTIMATELY DEPEND ON ALL PROVIDERS. HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME AD YOUR COMPLETE. UP DATA. WITH PATIENTS MEANS BY. PROVIDE FOR OUR PRIME CARE FOR. A COUPLE OF SPECIALIST A MENTAL PROVIDER ANOTHER'S IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE PATIENTS HOLD YOUR TEAM HAVE ACCESS TO THE INSIGHTS AND INFORMATION. TO PROVIDE SEAMLESS EFFECTIVE HIGH QUALITY CARE. CARE TEAMS EQUIPPED WITH CURRENT PATIENT DATA ALLOW FOR QUICK RESPONSES TO PROVIDE RELEVANT RESOURCES AND SOLUTIONS TO HELP A PATIENT. WHEN AND WHERE THEY NEED IT WE HAD A HEALTH CALLENGE THAT MERITS A REFERRAL TO AN ADDITIONAL CLINICIAN OR NON CLINICAL CHALLENGES SUCH AS FOOD OR TRANSPORTATION. IN CHINESE CAN ALSO ASSIST CHARACTER NAMES AND MAINTAINING CONNECTION WITH THE PATIENT THEMSELVES. IMAGINE OF A PATIENT MOVES OR CHANGES THEIR PHONE NUMBER AND ONLY REVEALS THAT CHANGE TO ONE MEMBER OF THEIR CARE TEAM. UNDER THE EXISTING SILENCE SYSTEMS OF CARE THAT ONE PROVIDER WOULD BE THE ONLY CONNECTION TO THE PATIENT UNLESS THAT INFORMATION IS SHARED WITH EACH MEMBER OF THE CARE TEAM. HOWEVER WITH A FULLY REALIZED AN INTEGRATED HIV THAT IS FURTHER SUPPORTED WITH THE STATEWIDE CONSENT REGISTRY THAT CHANGING CONTACT INFORMATION AS APPROPRIATE CAN BE SHARED INSTANTANEOUSLY. THROUGH THE A TRYING ALLOWING THE REST OF THE TEAM TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CLINICAL AND NON CLINICAL CARE FOR THE PATIENTS. THE SCENARIOS ARE TRULY THE TYPE OF THE ICEBERG WHEN IT COMES TO THE POTENTIAL OF HOW FULLY INTEGRATED AND INTEROPERABLE IN CHINESE IN THE STATE CAN HELP ADDRESS. HEALTH DISPARITIES AND ELEVATE THE LEVEL OF CARE FOR PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY THOSE MOST VULNERABLE SURVIVE MEDICARE PROGRAM. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT A CHINESE CAN BE THE FOUNDATION AND PLATFORM FOR YOUR TEAM'S WORKING COLLECTIVELY TO PROVIDE QUALITY CARE. I'D LIKE TO CLOSE OF MY THOUGHTS AND REMARKS BY BRIEFLY TOUCHING ON THREE KEY POINTS THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS CONVERSATIONS OF ALL. IN THE STATEWIDE HIV SPACE FIRST IT IS IMPERATIVE. THAT WE WORK TO ENSURE. THAT EVERY PROVIDER AND HEALTH PLAN IN THE STATE HAVE A UNIT PLAN. TO SAVE AND SICK CHAU THAT. IN THE DAY. THIS PLATFORM I ALSO SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY CLEAR GUIDANCE FROM THE STATE AROUND WHAT DATA CAN'T BE CHANGED HOW TO DO IT. SECONDLY CALIFORNIA SHOULD DEVELOP AND SECURE AN ONGOING SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR H. I. INFRASTRUCTURE AND INCENTIVES TO PARTICIPATE. ESPECIALLY LEVERAGING FEDERAL FINANCING WHERE POSSIBLE. AND FINALLY THE STATE SHOULD FOLLOW THE LEAD OF SO MANY OTHER STATES AND CONSIDER BUILDING A SECURE STATEWIDE HIV INFASTRUCTURE THAT LEVERAGES EXISTING REGIONAL IN CHINESE IN CALIFORNIA. AND CORRELATING INVESTMENTS THEY'VE ALREADY MADE THAT HAVE ALREADY OCCURRED. THANK YOU SO MUCH DR RUTH AND THE ENTIRE COMMITTEE AND STAFF FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DRESS THE COMMITTEE TODAY AND- I LOOK FORWARD TO FUTURE CONVERSATIONS AROUND A STATEWIDE HIV. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I HOPE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO HANG WITH US AND- MAYBE ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS LATER- SO NEXT OUR NEXT STEP PARRIS THIS FROM. KAISER'S DR WALTER CHAV AS FAR AS EXCUSE ME- APOLOGIES. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY AND POLICY. DOCTORS WERE AS. YEAH THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO CHECK THAT YOUR- THE ARMY OKAY YES WE ARE PERFECT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WELL- NEED TO SHARE A MEMBERS OF A COMMUNITY MY NAME IS WALTER SWART THEM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FELT LIKE THE PRIVATE THE APOLOGY BURKHART THE PERMANENTLY. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT OUR STATE POLICY CAN BE USED TO DRIVE THE EXCHANGE OF HEALTH INFORMATION. KAISER PERMANENTE STRONGLY SUPPORTS STATEWIDE AND NATIONWIDE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE OF POLICY THE BILL FUNDING FIFTEEN LOCAL REGIONAL AND NATIONAL HIF. WE DO BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A ROBUST AND DIVERSE HEALTH DATA EXCHANGE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. AND SIGNIFICANT ELECTRONIC EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING EVERY DAY. IN TWENTY TWENTY FOR EXAMPLE YOU CALIFORNIA ALONE CHI TO PERMANENT IT EXCHANGE HEALTH INFORMATION ELECTRONICALLY WITH OVER TWENTY SIX HUNDRED- AND I STATE AGAIN THAT TWENTY SIX HUNDRED- PROVIDERS OUTSIDE OUR SYSTEM MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLION TIMES THE I. FIFTEEN REGIONAL. AND NATIONAL HRD NETWORK. FIFTY FIVE THE ERROR CODE NINETEEN DEMONSTRATED HOW CRITICAL HIV CAPABILITIES ARE TO SUPPORT VIRTUAL CARE. DELIVERY AND PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS MAYBE BRIEFLY ADDRESSED THE POOR QUESTIONS PROVIDED TO US BY THE COMMITTEE. REGARDING QUESTION ONE- CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES PROVIDERS IT'S A BIT PUBLIC HEALTH OKAY REPORT DIRECTLY TO THE LOCAL HEALTH AGENCIES IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS. AND BECAUSE OF LIMITATIONS IN THEIR TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES MOST COUNT YET HEALTH DEPARTMENT ARE CONNECTED TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. YEAH THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH MEDICAL RESEARCH CORP OR T. HMRC WHICH SERVES AT THE CLEARING HOUSE THAT ENABLES THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO RECEIVE ELECTRONIC DATA. INCLUDING HANDLING THAT THE MEXICAN INCREASE IN REPORTING TO CALL IT. THERE ARE HOWEVER TWO IMPORTANT GAPS THAT WE BELIEVE NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. FIRST COVERED NINETEEN HAVE UNDERSCORED THE NEED TO STRENGTHEN AND MODERNIZE THE PUBLIC HEALTH INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE. OKAY CAPACITY AN AGENCY RESOURCES TO BETTER SUPPORT AND A CHRONIC REPORTING USING NATIONAL STANDARDS AND TO CONNECT TO REGIONAL AND NATIONAL HRD NETWORK. AND SECOND IT IS IMPERATIVE TO ALSO ADDRESS BASIC INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY NEEDS OF KEY HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS SMALL RURAL AND URBAN PRACTICES. COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AND OTHER SAFETY NET PROVIDERS IN AREAS SUCH AS THE USE OF INTEROPERABLE EHR SYSTEM AND ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY SERVICES. SEVERAL FEDERAL AND STATE PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES INCLUDING PVC AND INDUSTRY GROUPS ARE WORKING ON A NATIONAL INITIATIVE CALLED DIGITAL BRIDGE TO ENABLE BETTER FASTER SIMPLER AND MORE RELIABLE EXCHANGE OF PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTING INFORMATION BETWEEN HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES USING EXISTING NATIONAL AND REGIONAL NETWORKS AND STANDARDS. AND ADDING DECISION SUPPORTING TELL AGAINST A REPORT ABILITY KNOWLEDGE BASE THAT. THIS INITIATIVE OF RAPIDLY HAVE EXPANDED THE ABILITY TO PERFORM IN THE TRUNCATE REPORTING DURING PUBLIC NINETEENTH AND THAT MAKE- LAST YEAR- AND THIS- WHAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE WAS ABLE TO BE DONE WITHOUT THE NEED TO CREATE IN THE YOU KNOW. HIV OR- ORGANIZATIONS OR OR H. ID NETWORKS. ON YOUR SECOND QUESTION- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE CHALLENGES WITH HEALTHY SPIRIT AND HELP CONNECT WOULD THE- HAVE DEEPER ROADS COST- DIFFERENT ROUTE COST THAN. THE LACK OF HIV OPTIONS. MAJOR FACTORS- BUT IF I COULD. TO HELL DISPARITIES INCLUDE LACK OF EQUITABLE ACCESS TO CARE. AND A COMBINATION OF ADVERSE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL HELP THE- ADDRESSING HEALTH INEQUITIES REQUIRES- THAT WE FIRST IDENTIFY THEM BY CAPTURING THE RIGHT INFORMATION AND THEN DETERMINE THE ROOT CAUSE. IN THIS REGARD ABILITY OF HIV TO SUPPORT THESE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE SOMEWHAT LIMITED. THERE IS HOWEVER A DIFFERENT SOLUTION INTO WORK A TO HELP IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS HEALTH DISPARITIES. MISTER CHAIRMAN UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP AND THROUGH AN OPEN AND PARTICIPATORY PROFIT BY TOSSPOT. THE STATE IS NOW POISED TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE PAYMENT DATA PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDES A COMPREHENSIVE DATABASE ON THAT THAT THE BILL. UTILIZATION COST AND QUALITY OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES. BIG DATA BASE WILL CAP CAPTURE ALL HEALTHCARE COUNTERS IN CLAIMS OF PROFIT BY PLAYERS IN THE STATE INCLUDING PUBLIC PROGRAM. I'M PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF A WHERE THE SPIRIT IS THE PATH THEN TO INFORM POLICY THAT A GREAT BUT- HIV POLICY TO. LEVERAGE THE NEW PROGRAM TO HELP ADDRESS OF THE- TO THE THIRD PARTY AND WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT ADDRESSING UPPER SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL HEALTH NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS AND THE COMMUNITY. IS TRULY AT THE CENTER OF VALUE BASED CARE AND EVERY HEALTHCARE EDUCATION IN DEVELOPING AN INNOVATIVE APPROACHES O SOLVE IT THE- CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE SEPARATIST THE INTERACTION BETWEEN HEALTH PLANS HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS PUBLIC HEALTH. AND SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS OR SO CALLED TV ALL THOSE WERE TOWARD. PLEASE TURN BEING ABLE TO REFER INDIVIDUAL AT THE POINT OF CARE BUT HOUSING SHELTER OR FOOD PANTRY THAT THEY MEET. THE CBO SO OFTEN LACK THE MOST BASIC TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITIES NEEDED TO INTERACT ELECTRONICALLY WITH PROVIDERS WITH HEALTH PLAN THAT WITH PUBLIC HEALTH. I'M TO PROVE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND HAVE THE CONNECTIVITY- AND EXCHANGE OF HEALTH INFORMATION WITH CBO TO CROSS THE STATE. I THINK I PRIORITY HIV POLICY GOAL TO BE THREE BATH IN ENHANCING AND STRENGTHENING THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TELL CBO SINCE SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. SO THEY CAN BETTER COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER THANK CONNECT TO ROBOT JERRY NETWORK THAT TODAY. LASTLY TO YOUR QUESTION NUMBER FOUR WE STRONGLY SUPPORT HIV POLITICS AND LEVERAGE AT THE THAT LEVERAGES COULD BE NETWORK. WE BELIEVE THAT A TIGHT SERVICES OF WHETHER NATIONAL OR REGIONAL ARE READILY AVAILABLE ANYWHERE. THERE IS A AFFORDABLE ACCESSIBILITY TO BROADBAND INTERNET CONNECTIVITY. AND THAT THE THAT SHE FOUND THE DATA SHARING THAT SUPPORT THE WHOLE PERSON VIEW THAT'S NOT DEPEND REALLY ON LOCAL REGIONAL GETTING PATIENT OR DATABASES. I THINK MENTIONED EARLIER GAPS IN THE DATA SHARING ARE NOT DUE TO A LACK OF LOCAL HIV ORGANIZATION. THE LACK OF LACK OF TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES AMONG PROVIDERS LACK OF LOCALLY HR CONFIGURATIONS FOR INTERPRETIVE THE- OR AND LACK OF AFFORDABLE BROADBAND ACCESS. REGIONAL H. I ORGANIZATIONS ARE A REAL SPENT CANNOT REALLY ADDRESS. THOSE MORE FOUNDATIONAL CHILD. TO CONCLUDE WE BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT TO THE STATE ME. SETTING UP AN HRA THE NON. VERSUS SUPPORTING STATEWIDE AND NATIONAL HIV THE BURBS. A DIVERSE SET OF A TINY OPTIONS ALREADY EXIST AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE THAT PROGRESS. AND WE EXPECT THAT THE FLOW OF INFORMATION ACROSS THE NETWORK WILL EXPAND RAPIDLY IN RESPONSE TO A RECENT FEDERAL MANDATES ON INFORMATION BLOCKING EXPANDED INFORMATION SHARING. ANDTHE USE OF NEWER TECHNOLOGY SUCH A FIX YOUR APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES OR API'S. AND HL SEVEN FIRE TENDERS. THEY ALSO SUCH TRUCE INACTION HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE ARE NOT MYSTERIOUS. WE NEED TO INVEST IN THIS SO CALLED LAST MILE TO IT ENHANCE THE CONNECTIVITY OF ALL PROVIDER BY IMPROVING ACCESS TO BROADBAND SERVICES SUPPORTING PRACTICE AND- PRACTICES AND FACILITY INVESTMENT INTO TECHNOLOGY. TO ENABLE IMPROPER ABILITY AND INTEROPERABLE CONNECTIVITY AND MODERNIZE OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR PERSPECTIVE WITH THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE'LL GO AHEAD ND MOVE ON NEXT TO OUR FINAL PANELIST A PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN DOCTOR MORE. TO PROTECT MORE THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER. THAT'S RIGHT YEAH CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES THANK YOU GREAT THANK THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HI MY NAME IS ROBERT MORE ABOUT FAMILY PHYSICIAN AND THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER AT PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE COUNTY ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEM PROVIDING ACCOUNT MANAGED CARE COVERAGE IN FOURTEEN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES RANGING FROM SUBURBAN COUNTIES LIKE MARIN. AND SOLANO TO RURAL IN FRONT YOUR COUNTIES LIKE DELBARTON MODOC ON THE OTHER PANELISTS PROVIDED REALLY EXCELLENT TESTIMONY IN AN EXAMPLES OF MANY OF THE CURRENT CHALLENGES AND CURRENT SUCCESSES WHICH I WON'T REPEAT PARTNERSHIP HAS- SOME UNDERSTANDING OF THE SOCIAL SERVICE AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH EXCHANGE NEEDS- FROM OUR WHOLE PERSON CARE EXPERIENCE- AND ALSO- WE HAVE EXTENSIVE AND DIVERSE EXPERIENCES WITH DIFFERENT- REGIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS. SO I WILL BE FOCUSING MY WAY OUT COMMENTS ON THOSE THIRD AND FOURTH POTENTIAL GOALS THAT. DOCTOR WOULD YOU MENTION AT THE BEGINNING LOOKING AT. MY LEARNED. WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS- IN THE SMALLER COUNTIES- AND ALSO LOOKING AT THE OPTIMAL SCOPE OF REGIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS. A VERY BRIEFLY UP THAT THE PARTNERSHIP SERVICE AREA INCLUDES SIX COUNTIES THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS WITH SIX DIFFERENT STRATEGIES FOR ADDRESSING INFORMATIONAL NEEDS RELATED TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND- SOCIAL SERVICES AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. WE ANALYZED ALL SIX STRATEGIES AND DETECTED SOME PATTERNS AND BEST PRACTICES WHICH I'LL COVER AND THEN SEPARATELY A PARTNERSHIP THE PARTNERSHIP SERVICE AREA ALSO INCLUDES TO CURRENT. REGIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS THE NORTH COAST HEALTH INFORMATION IMPROVEMENT NETWORK AND SEXUALLY MET SHARE WITH CURRENTLY ACTIVE STATE EXCHANGES WITH BOTH OF THEM. WE ALSO- HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH THREE PRIOR HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS WANT ONE OF WHICH MERGED WITH SEXUAL IN NATURE A FEW YEARS AGO IN THE AND THE OTHER TWO ARE NO LONGER ACTIVE. IN WONDER WHAT I WOULD CALL A TRANS STATE H. I. U. THAT THE COLLECTIVE MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES ANY PLATFORM. UNLIKE INLAND EMPIRE HEALTH PLAN THE PC PC INSIDERS HAVE BEEN REALLY KEY TO GETTING HIGH LEVELS OF HOSPITAL PARTICIPATION IN LOCAL IN CHINESE AS WELL AS- IN ADOPTING. EIGHTY WELL BEFORE. THESE FOR GOING TO JUST BRIEF ADDRESSED SUPPORT FOR THE FIRST PROPOSED GOAL OF A STATE WIDE HIV INFRASTRUCTURE MAKING INFORMATION AND LOCAL. EACH I USE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PURPOSES IT'S A REAL WAR THE GOAL AND- IN THIS CONTEXT IT CAN HELP WITH PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES LIKE COVERT. EFFECTIVELY JUST AS ONE EXAMPLE ONE OF OUR H. I. DOES THE SMALL ONE. NORTH COAST HEALTH INFORMATION AND RECRUITMENT NETWORK WORKERS HUMBOLDT COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH TO USE THE DATA AND THEIR H. ID TO. MAP OUT THE NUMBER AND IDENTITY OF INDIVIDUALS FALLING INTO DIFFERENT PRIORITIZATION CATEGORIES FOR KODAK'S NATION FOR MOST OF THE POPULATION OF HUMBOLDT COUNTY. IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE VALUE PROVIDED BY LOCAL COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN THE CHINESE AND COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH. I'M SWITCHING GEARS TO USING HA FOR SOCIAL SERVICES AND SOCIAL CURRENTS OF HEALTH WHAT IS PARTNERSHIP LEARN. ABOUT THE INFORMATION NEEDS- FROM WHOLE PERSON CARE COUNTIES REALLY THERE'S A THREE LESSONS ON THAT I THINK THAT WE'VE WE'VE LEARNED THE FIRST IS THAT. BRINGING DATA TOGETHER WITH INTERFACES DOES NOT MEAN THAT DATA WILL ACTUALLY BE USED OR USEFUL- ALIGNING INCENTIVES OF DIFFERENT WHOLE PERSON CARE PARTNERS WAS CHEATING GETTING THEM TO USE. A SHARED COMMUNICATION AND RESOURCE PLATFORM. ORGANIZATIONS THAT DEVELOPED EXTENSIVE INTERFACES BUT HAVE NOT ALIGNING INCENTIVES FOUND LITTLE VALUE IN THESE INTERFACES. ORGANIZATIONS WITH ALIGNED INCENTIVES DEVELOPING MORE ROBUST CARE PLANS AND A GOOD EXCHANGE OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN MEMBERS OF CARE TEAMS. EVEN IF THEY HAD CLASS INTERFACES BUILT. LESS EXPECTED EXCHANGE. SO PEOPLE IS THE CAR OF ALL INTERFACES AND SYSTEMS MAY VASTLY EXCEED THE TIME SAVINGS OF JUST HAVING ACCESS TO THE SYSTEMS EXTRACTING IMPORTANT INFORMATION FROM ONE AND BRIEFLY ENTERING INTO ANOTHER SYSTEM. MEANS TO BE A PRIORITY PRIORITIZE PACE OF INTEGRATION OF DATA NOT ASSUME THAT MORE INTEGRATION MORE AGGREGATION IS AUTOMATICALLY BETTER. AND FINALLY I MANY ORGANIZATIONS DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY OR EXPERTISE IN ANALYTICS TO USE THAT DATA THEY ALREADY HAVE ACCESS TO GENERATE NEW KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM MUCH LESS ADDITIONAL DATA BROUGHT IN FROM OTHER SOURCES. BUILDING ANALYTICS CAPACITY OF THE DATA WE ALREADY HAVE WILL GENERATE MORE VALUE. FINALLY LET ME MOVE ON TO THE QUESTION OF THE OPTIMAL SCOPE OF COMMUNITY HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS- WHAT IS PC LEARN FROM OUR EXPERIENCE. A ONE KEY TAKEAWAY I THINK IS THAT IMPROVING ACCESS TO USABLE DATA AND INFORMATION ACROSS. DIFFERENT PROVIDERS AND HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IS NOT ACHIEVED BY HAVING A SINGLE STATEWIDE HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATION USING A SINGLE PLATFORM. A STATEWIDE FRAMEWORK FOR EXCHANGING DATA BETWEEN ORGANISATIONS AND NGOS WHAT IS NEEDED NOT A SINGLE STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION TO BE THE AGGREGATOR OF DATA THROUGHOUT THE STATE. FLOOR EXPERIENCE ORGANIZATIONS SUCCESSFUL IN COORDINATING EXCHANGE THIS INFORMATION OUT FOR TRAITS ARE THE FIRST TO FINANCIAL STABILITY. AND A SECURE AND ROBUST TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM. ARE DEFINITELY FAVORED BY LARGER ORGANIZATIONS ON. THIS THE NEXT TO GO A COMMUNITY RESPONSE OF GOVERNANCE THAT INCLUDES CLINICAL INPUT THAT ALLOWS. LOCAL COMPETITORS TO BUILD SUFFICIENT TRUST TO WORK TOGETHER. AND THE LAST ONE THE MANAGEMENT FOCUSED ON THE OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS IN MEETING THE NEEDSOF THE USERS. THEY THEY TEND TO HAVE A DIMINISHED ON. A DIMINISH RELATIONSHIP TO SCIENCE SO AND SO THE SIZE OF THE H. I. O. IS REALLY IN THE MIDDLE MIDDLE GROUND WHERE IT'S BIG ENOUGH TO OF THE FINANCIAL STABILITY ROBUST TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM BUT IT'S SMALL ENOUGH TO BE COMMUNITY RESPONSIVE. AND MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR OF THEIR COMMUNITY USERS. SO I WOULD AGREE THAT US STATE ACTS SOME STATE ACTIONS ARE NEEDED NOW BUT NOT ALL ACTIONS ARE EQUALLY HIGH PRIORITY I RECOMMEND. COMMITTEE PRIORITIZE THE AREAS WHERE THE STATE IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO ADDRESS WITH STANDARDS. REGULATIONS AND INCENTIVES ARE TO MAKE OUR HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE STATE OF WORK MORE EFFECTIVELY THANK YOU DR WAIT FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THIS INPUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE GOT AMOUNT WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO SOME QUESTIONS ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS NOW. AND THOSE MEMBERS WHO ARE WATCHING REMOTELY WHO HAVE A QUESTION YOU CAN EITHER TEXT ME DIRECTLY- I KNOW YOU ALL HAVE MY TAX MY PHONE NUMBER. OR USE THE CHAT. FEATURE IN THE IN THE IN THE WEBEX- PROGRAM THERE- BUT- TO GETTING STARTED I'M GOING TO GO RIGHT NOW SOME ASK SOME GENERAL QUESTIONS. AS FOLLOW UPS HERE AND THEN SOME SPECIFIC QUESTIONS TO- AS WELL AS I WAS BEEN TAKING NOTES SO- THE QUESTION IN ANYBODY. CAN CHIME IN HERE IF YOU KNOW THE ANSWER SO- FOR OUR SEVEN PANEL- SO DO DO NATIONAL NETWORK HAVE THE- TO PUSH ALERTS TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS SUCH AS- YOU KNOW HAS A PATIENT FILLED AN OPIOID PRESCRIPTION OR RECEIVE A CODE TEST. TO THE NASH SO DO YOUR TO THE NATIONAL NETWORKS HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT. I CAN GET THIS DELORES AND I I'D BE HAPPY TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS ON THAT- BASICALLY THE NATIONAL NETWORKS IT'S A QUERY SYSTEM SO YOU ARE CLEAR GREEN ONE PATIENT AT A TIME INFORMATION ON THAT PATIENT AND SO YOU CAN GET INFORMATION ON THAT PATIENT. IT'LL GO OUT AND SEARCH- THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS AND PULLED BACK INFORMATION ON THAT SINGLE PATIENT WHAT YOU CAN'T DO IS GET THE INFORMATION SAY ON ALL YOUR PATIENCE YOU COULDN'T GET A REPORT THAT SAYS. I HAVE TWO THOUSAND PATIENTS AND FIVE HUNDRED OF THEM HAVE GOTTEN THEIR THEIR VACCINATION AND I STILL HAVE ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED THAT MEET THE CURRENT CRITERIA THAT SHE THAT I COULD OUT REACH TO GET IN TO GET THEIR VACCINATION. OKAY LIVING. ANYBODY ELSE HAVE ANY ANY THOUGHT ON THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU ON THE SCREEN. YEAH THIS IS WALTER STARTS WITH THE RIGHT TO PRINT AGAIN- YEAH I THINK THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS YES- THEY ARE CAPABLE AND THEY'RE ABLE TO. PUSH NOTICES- I THINK THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THEY- ARE CURRENTLY DOING IT FOUR ONE. AND ALSO TO WHAT EXTENT THEY PUSH COMES FROM THE PARTICIPANTS THAT ARE- THE GAPING DOES NATIONAL- HIV- A NETWORK. OF BY THE IN REALITY THEY ARE CAPABLE AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE NEAR FUTURE STARTING MAY OF THIS YEAR WITH THAT- REQUIREMENTS. FROM OF- THE FOR THANK MEDICAID. UNDER WE CAN REGULATIONS- THE NEED TO PUSH OR SOMETHING CALL AT T. ADMISSION DISCHARGE AND TRANSFER IS VERY SIMPLE AND SO I THINK I THINK- WE'RE GOING TO BE A LOT MORE OF- OF. THE ABILITY TO PUSH OUT- MESSAGES AND NOTICED THAT- TO ANYBODY THAT NEEDS AN INCLUDING PUBLIC HEALTH. OKAY WELL THAT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT ANSWERS WE HAVE ONE. WE HAVE ONE PERSON WHO SAID NOW YOU HAVE TO DO IT IS AN INDIVIDUAL QUERY AND DOCTORS WERE AS YOU HAVE SAID THAT THAT THEY CAN A NATIONAL NETWORKS DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO PUSH ALERTS OUT SO- THAT CREATES A LITTLE CONFUSION FOR THE COMMITTEE HERE. YOU EITHER YOU EITHER HAVE THE ABILITY AND IS BEING USED OR YOU HAVE TO DO THE QUERY SO- NOT REALLY SURE OUT WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THIS- I LOOK AT THIS ISSUE HERE BUT THAT'S A- THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A DISCREPANCY OR OR OR A DIFFERENCE OF. OPINION ON THAT SO- IT YOU KNOW IF THERE ARE AREAS OF THE STATE THAT DO NOT HAVE ANY HAVE AN H. ID- THE BAY AREA FOR EXAMPLE HAS A HUGE WHITE SPACE WHICH IS. KIND OF SHOCKING TO ME BECAUSE OF. THE FACT THAT IT IS A LARGE METROPOLITAN AREA YOUNG WITH AND WE ALSO HAVE EASTERN. AND INLAND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE LIMITED PROVIDER PARTICIPATION IN EXISTING. EHR EASE. HOW WOULD YOU RECOMMEND A STATE DEAL WITH THAT. GERMAN HAPPY TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS SAID THIS IS YOUR- LIFE H. P. NO WE'VE WE'VE FOUND THAT WITH OUR OUR REGIONAL H. I. APPROACH THAT. RELATED TO HAVE MANIFESTED. IF YOU WILL THAT IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE ALL OF THOSE REGIONALLY CHINESE AND TO A STATEWIDE. A UTILITY OR STATEWIDE HIV A TO DO THAT KIND OF WORK OUT WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE THE WORK THAT'S ARE. DONE WITH THE SO MANY COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND SO MANY REGIONS AND- THOSE AREAS THAT ARE COVERED UP BY A CURRENT REGIONAL HIV CAN ACTUALLY EASILY BE COVERED. BY THAT STATEWIDE APPROACH ONCE ALL OF THOSE REGIONAL IN CHINESE GET NETWORKED TOGETHER BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE INCREDIBLE WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE IN YOUR COMMUNITY SO WE MAKE A GOOD FIRST STEP TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN IS TO CHECK CREATE THAT CONNECTION WITH THOSE. REGIONAL ENTITIES THAT HAVE DONE SUCH GREAT WORK WITH THE SPECIALISTS AND SENSITIZATION FOR THE HOSPITALS AND PROVIDER COMMUNITY. AND THEN LITERALLY BRINGING OUT IN THOSE REGIONS EITHER AROUND THEM AND TO THOSE REGIONALLY CHINESE OR AT WITH THAT TOPIC THAT MASTER HIV IF YOU WILL AT THE STATE LEVEL. THAT UTILITY THAT. CAN ACTUALLY CALL ON THE REST OF THE STATE. AT THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT ANY ANY ELSE HAVE THOUGHTS WHAT WE MIGHT DO FOR THESE AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE ANYTHING. YEP MISTER CHAIRMAN IF I MAY- DAVID PHARMACY AMERICA- IF FIRST OF ALL WE NEED WE NEED TO AGREE UPON WHAT A WHITE SPACE S. AND THIS IS WHERE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ANY CHINA EITHER BERMAN H. I HAVE THEM NOW- BECAUSE- WE SAY FIRST. THAT THE BAY AREA AS AS A WHITE SPACE IS ACTUALLY PROMULGATED BECAUSE ON BAY AREA- IT JUST THERE'S NOT A REGIONAL H. I. L. THE SAME THING IS TRUE OR WHERE WE'RE SITTING RIGHT NOW IN SACRAMENTO- YES. IS A LOT OF DATA EXCHANGE THAT'S HAPPENING HERE- BUT IT'S UNEVEN AMONG THE PROVIDERS BECAUSE IT'S LARGER SYSTEMS THAT ARE USING THE NATIONAL NETWORKS EXCHANGE WITH EACH OTHER. MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR SMALL PROVIDERS TO PARTICIPATE- SO THAT'S WHAT WE YOU KNOW AS WE TRY TO DEFINE THE PROBLEM TRYING TO SOLVE FOR. THAT POLICYMAKERS ARE IS ONE OF THE PROBLEM TRYING TO SOLVE FOR. IS AREN'T NECESSARILY DATA EXCHANGE WHITE SPACES THAT THAT THAT'S PROVIDERS WHO CAN'T PARTICIPATE IN THE FORMER DATA EXCHANGE. THAT'S HAPPENING IN THOSE REGIONS. WITH YOU JUST KIND OF MADE IN OUR IN FAVOR OF SOMETHING MORE COHESIVE AND- THERE. AT IT. IF THEY CAN'T PARTICIPATE THEN WE SHOULD BE GIVING THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIND SOMETHING THEY CAN PARTICIPATE IN. ISN'T THAT CORRECT. YEAH WELL ANYONE THAT COULD COME IN SEVERAL FORMS I MEAN THERE COULD BE REGIONALLY GILES I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH WITH DOCTOR MORE- THE CLOSER WE KEEP A CHILD WAS TO THE GROUND. EASIER IT IS TO BUILD TRUST AND LOAN- YOU KNOW OR- WE NEED TO SUPPORT THE PROVIDERS. IN GETTING ONTO MORE ROBUST SYSTEMS ALLOW THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN OTHER FORMS OF DATA EXCHANGE. OKAY STILL ALL THOSE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX IS. SENATE JUST OF BRIEF BRIEF WORD ON THAT YOU KNOW THERE WERE SOME ATTEMPTS TO CREATE HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS IN THE BAY AREA IN THE PAST AND THEY COULDN'T GET PAST THE TRUST ISSUES AND THE THING IS NOT AN EXTERNAL MANDATE ONE OVERCOME THE TRUST CHALLENGES IN THE END YOU DO HAVE TO COME UP WITH A MECHANISM TO GET COMPETITORS TO. FEEL SAFE- CONTRIBUTING DATA THAT THEY YOU CAN SEE WITH EACH OTHER AND UNDERSTAND THEIR ON THAT THEIR MUTUAL MUTUAL CHARACTER AND QUALITY CARE FOR THEIR YOUR PATIENCE IS AT STAKE SO. I'M NOT SURE. ELABORATE ON TRUST FOR ME BECAUSE- AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS THE PATIENTS INFORMATION. THE MEDICAL RECORD IS THE PATIENT'S RECORD. THE PROVIDER IS THE CUSTODIAN OF THE RECORDS IT'S NOT THE PROPERTY OF THE PLAN OR THE DOCTOR OR THE HOSPITAL IT YOUR CUSTODIAN OF THAT SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT PART OF THE ISSUE IS THAT. ENTITIES DON'T WANT TO TRUST EACH OTHER WITH THE INFORMATION. BECAUSE IT'S NOT YOUR IN FOR IT'S NOT YOUR DECISION TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT IT'S THE PICK IT SHOULD BE THE PATIENT'S DECISION AND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT THE CONSENT IS SO. HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE I'M- I DON'T I DON'T UNDERSTAND RIGHT WELL LET ME. THE WEIGHT HA STALK THEY DON'T WORK BY ASKING EACH INDIVIDUAL PATIENT DO YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE. TO THIS H. ID THAT'S NOT THE WAY WE WORK. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT DOING NOW THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE LOOKING TO CONSIDER SO. YES SO IF THAT IS CONSIDERED IT WILL ACTUALLY SORT OF IF YOU THINK ABOUT IF YOU WERE TO REQUIRE. AN OPT IN FOR ANY H. I EAT IT WITH IT WOULD DEFEAT THE PURPOSE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE OF TRYING TO GET THAT KIND OF- COMPREHENSIVE DATA. SO BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING COMPREHENSIVE DATA WITHOUT PATIENT CONSENT YOU HAVE TO USE- THAT'S WHERE THE TRUST COMES IN THERE HAS TO BE IT HAS TO FIT WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF. OF OF HIPPA. AND ALSO IN THE FRAMEWORK OF PRIVACY AND SECURITY- AT THE END THAT DOES THAT'S WHERE THAT THE CHALLENGES. ARISE THERE'S ALSO THERE ARE SOME FRANKLY THERE ARE SOME ORGANIZATIONS WORK WE'RE NOT FOR PROFIT WE DON'T. YOU KNOW HAVE TO HAVE THIS CONCERN BUT- BUT THERE ARE- YOU KNOW ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE WHO ARE. COMPETITORS IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC AREA WE'RE WORRIED THAT THE DATA MIGHT BE MIND TO BE USED FOR- AFRICAN- COMPETITIVE PURPOSES SO THAT THAT'S. A CONCERN THAT'S THAT'S OUT THERE. SO IT A BUSINESS. ISSUE NOT AT AT THE TRUST ISSUE THE BUSINESS LAW. NOT IN THE INTEREST OF THE PATIENT'S OVERALL HEALTH CONDITION. YEP I WOULD SAY THAT IT STEP THAT SOME OF THE MAJOR CERTAINLY WHEN CINICIANS GET TOGETHER THEY ALL GENERALLY AGREE THAT WE NEED TO EXCHANGE DATA TO IMPROVE HEALTH. ON THE HEALTH STATUS OF OUR MAP OF OUR OF OUR PATIENTS WE SERVE. THAT'S THAT'S NOT IT THAT'S KNOWS NO DISAGREEMENT THERE BUT THE QUESTION IS WILL ALL PLAYERS WHO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT DATA ONLY BE USING THE DATA FOR THAT PURPOSE. FOR WITHHOLDING THAT INFORMATION SO THAT IT CAN'T BE SHARED. ALL RIGHT I GUESS SO OKAY. I WILL TAKES IT TAKES ACTIVE WORK TO CREATE AN INTERFACE THAT'S NOT IT'S NOT ACTIVE WORK TO YOU KNOW IT IT TAKES DOLLARS IT TAKES- DISCRETIONARY ENERGY TO BUILD EACH EACH OF THOSE INTERFACES SO. IT'S NOT JUST IT'S NOT REALLY WORTH HOLDING AS MUCH AS DE PRIORITIZING YOU MIGHT SAY. OKAY OKAY THANK YOU- ACTUALLY QUESTION FOR DOLORES- IF YOU- IF YOU'RE A NEW YOU'RE STILL OUT THERE SO- YOU TALKED ABOUT- THE SUCCESSES OF YOUR OF YOUR H. ID DURING- DURING- COATED- SO. IS EVERYBODY'S PARTICIPATING IN YOUR H. ID N. AND IN THE RIVERSIDE AREA THE WORST. AN EMPIRE- THE MAJORITY OF HOSPITALS ARE PARTICIPATING THERE ARE A COUPLE THAT ARE NOT- BUT AND THEN THE MAJORITY OF THE LARGE GROUPS ARE PARTICIPATING AND NOW WE ARE DOWN TO TRYING TO BRING ON THE SOLO SMALL GROUP PRACTICE- PHYSICIANS WHICH BRINGS ITS OWN CHALLENGES BECAUSE OF THE COSTS THAT THE A EHR VENDORS. MAY CHARGE THAT THE PRACTICE TO DO THE WORK ON THEIR END ALTHOUGH THE- PARTICIPATION IN OUR H. I. E. S. AT NO COST FOR THE AMATORY PROVIDERS BUT IT TAKES A LOT DID YOU HAVE TO BUILD THE INTERFACES THE INTERFACES ARE EXPENSIVE- I HAVE ONE- PEDIATRIC PRACTICE THAT HAS THREE PEDIATRICIANS AND IT. AND WHEN THEY WANTED TO SEND THE- A PATIENT ROSTER TO THE H. I EAT IN ORDER TO GET ALERTS ON THEIR PATIENTS WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM OUTSIDE OF THEIR FOR AT THEIR OFFICES THE EHR VENDOR WANTED EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS TO- PROGRAM A PATIENT ROSTER- AND- HE ACTUALLY THROUGH OUR- H. I. ELLO I AM SENDING OUR PEOPLE OUT AND IN FIVE MINUTES. WAS ABLE TO DEVELOP THE SPREADSHEET TO SEND THE PATIENT ROSTER TO THE H. I EAT PARTICIPATE SO THOSE ARE THE TYPE OF CHALLENGES THAT THE SMALL PRACTICES HAVE THEY DON'T HAVE THE I. T. EXPERTISE THEY DON'T HAVE EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THAT WAS JUST FOR ONE REPORT LET ALONE SAID THE THEIR- THEIR DATA INTO THE H. I. E. SO THERE'S A LOT OF CHALLENGES FOR THE SOLO SMALL GROUP PRACTICE TO PARTICIPATE- AND A LOT OF THAT. HAS TO DO WITH THE DATA BLOCKING THAT HOPEFULLY WILL BE RESOLVED BUT- AMONGST LONG ANSWER AND I APOLOGIZE SO I WOULD SAY THAT MOST OF THEBIG PRACTICES ARE PARTICIPATING A PARTICIPATING- AND NOW WE'RE WORKING. ON THE SMALLER PRACTICES. SO HOW MANY PROVIDE% ALL DO YOU HAPPEN RIVERSIDE COUNTY DO YOU KNOW ROUGHLY. I'M WELL IN THE INLAND EMPIRE SO I'M INCLUDING RIVERSIDE IN SAMBAR DINO COUNTIES THERE'S ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND PRACTICING PHYSICIANS AND THIRTY SEVEN HOSPITALS. OKAY SO ARE YOU AT LIBERTY TO SAY WHO WHICH HOSPITALS ARE PARTICIPATING IN YOUR H. ID ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. HE WROTE YES- SO NOT HAVING A DIRECT CONTRACT WITH THE R. H. I. E. IS THAT KAISER HOSPITALS BUT THEY ARE ACCESS THROUGH THE NATIONAL- EXCHANGE AND VICE VERSA- THE KAISER FACILITIES LOCALLY ACCESS- INFORMATION- THROUGH THROUGH A MANIFEST WHICH IS OUR LOCAL H. I EAT- TO RECIEVE DATA ON A PATIENT BY PATIENT BASIS. BUT NOT SENDING YOU KNOW ALERT SIR OR CASH CHARGE TRANSFERS LAB RESULTS THAT KIND OF STUFF INTO THAT THAT REPOSITORY. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MR FORWARD- JUST CURIOUS YOUR YOUR ORGANIZATION WAS APPEARED TO BE GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE HIV BUDGET PROPOSAL LAST YEAR- WHAT HAPPENED WHAT IT WOULD CONSIDER WHAT CHANGED THAT CAUSE YOU TO CHANGE. YOUR POLICY ON THAT. MMHM YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE THINGS- THAT HAPPENED- INTER HAVE MIDDLE LAST YEAR AND ARE VERY UNUSUAL LEGISLATIVE SESSION- THERE WERE MULTIPLE DISCUSSIONS AROUND. OKAY NO. CALLING A STATEWIDE AJ EVEN WAS TALK OF AN EXECUTIVE ORDER ONE POINT AROUND DATA EXCHANGE- AND YOU KNOW THE ONLY THING THAT ALL THOSE EFFORTS- HAVE IN COMMON IS THAT THEY WERE UNSUCCESSFUL. AND YOU KNOW IT CMA LOOKED AT THIS YEAR WE TOOK A STEP BACK IS THAT OKAY WHAT ARE THE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL PIECES THAT WE THINK NEED TO HAPPEN- NO MATTER HOW WE NEED FOR NINETEEN EXCHANGE WE DO A FEDERATED MODEL WITH. OTHER STATES THE OTHERS TALKING STATEWIDE HIV. THE CENTRAL COMPONENT THAT I LAID OUT EARLIER IN MY TALK NEED TO HAPPEN NO MATTER WHICH OF THOSE RIGHTS WILL TAKE. AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE CNN'S NOT RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THOSE REALLY FOUNDATIONAL THINGS THAT AS YOU YOU KNOW AS AS A CONFERENCE HERE YOU DON'T A LOT OF US OF SAYING ROUGHLY THE SAME THINGS. PUBLIC HEALTH DATA FEDERAL FUNDING. SUPPORT FOR SMALL PRACTICES. AND SO I DON'T YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK WE'VE- CHANGED POSITION AS MUCH AS WE- TOOK A STEP BACK AND SAID ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS IN ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL BUILDING BLOCKS BEACH IS TO PUT IN PLACE. TO REALLY LOOK AT EXCHANGE FORMER- I FOUND IT INTERESTING. WHEN YOU WERE TALKING YOU TALKED ABOUT- DATE WITH THAT WITH THE QUESTION THAT WAS COVERT RELATED YOU TALKED ABOUT WITH THAT WE GREAT FOR PRACTICES TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCESS CAL READY- AND- AT THE ACCESSIBLE AT A POINT AT A POINT IN THE PRACTICE. BUT THAT'S KIND OF A ONE WAY FLOW OF INFORMATION FOR A DOCTOR TO ACCESS ACCESS. SO ARE YOU AGAINST THE- THE FLOW OF INFORMATION THE OTHER WAY BECAUSE BECAUSE IT YOU KNOW IT'S GREAT IF YOU WANT TO QUERY IF THE DOCTOR WANTS TO UERY AND FIND OUT IF THIS PATIENT THERE BUT WOULDN'T IT BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE INFORMATION FLOWING YOU KNOW TO YOU. THROUGH AN ALERT OR SOMETHING. OH OH OH ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN THE PROBLEM WITH THE PROBLEM WITH THE CDPH DATA TODAY. IS THAT IT ONLY FLOWS ONE DIRECTION WE HAVE PROVIDERS WHO ARE PUTTING PEOPLE INTO THE SYSTEM AND YOU CAN'T GET ANYTHING BACK OUT- YOU KNOW CDPH HAS IT AND YOU KNOW I MIGHT SORT OF DOWNTIME WHICH SHE COMMENT ON THIS. CD PH HAS NHL YOU CAME WHEN WHAT WITH THIS GOVERNMENTS AND DEMOCRATS THAT. J. GATEWAY ONLY SWINGS ONE WAY. AND SO IT'S GREAT TO DEMAND BUT IT DOESN'T GET DATA BACK TO THE POINT CARE NOW I THINK YOU KNOW THE QUESTION IS. HOW DO WE GET THAT DATA IN THE POINT OF CARE. AND AGAIN. MULTIPLE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX. THE YOU KNOW SOME OF THE BIGGER SYSTEMS ARE CONNECTED DIRECTLY AT ICE- KEPT OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DATA. OTHER SMALLER PRACTICES ARE GOING TO NEED REGIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATIONS AGGREGATE AND STUFF AS AN INTERMEDIARY. ON THAT DATA IS ALL DIFFERENT WAYS WE CAN DO THIS BUT WE NEED TO REALLY ENHANCE THAT ABILITY FOR DAVID A FLAWED SYSTEM. AND IT'S I'VE FIND IT JUST A GENERAL COMMENT- SEVERAL PEOPLE OF FOLK HAVE HAVE TALKED ABOUT SMALL PRACTICES AND- A SENSE OF. HAVING BEEN SOMEONE WHO WAS ACTUALLY IN A SMALL PRACTICE. AS A DENTIST- YEAH I I'VE I SAW THOSE CHALLENGES AS WELL AND IT WAS IT WAS A CHALLENGE FOR ME AS A PROVIDER TO ADOPT. A CERTAIN KINDS OF TECHNOLOGIES BECAUSE OF MY LOCATION OR AND THE ABILITY TO SERVICE THOSE TECHNOLOGIES AND SO ON SO. SO I RECOGNIZE THAT IN WHATEVER WE WORK ON YOU CAN BET THAT I'M GOING TO BE LOOKING AT MAKING SURE THAT SMALL PROVIDERS- ARE ABLE TO DO THIS. BUT I DON'T WANT TO SEE SMALL PROVIDE THE SMALL THE SMALL PROVIDER ISSUE. AS BEING AS AN IMPEDIMENT FOR US TO DO SOMETHING I THINK THERE ARE SOLUTIONS FOR THAT AND I THINK THAT- I THINK EVERY EVERY PROVIDER NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO BENEFIT AND SHOULD BE A HAPPY ABLE TO ACCESS. THE SAME INFORMATION BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS ABOUT QUALITY OF CARE APPROPRIATE CARE NON DUPLICATIVE CARE CARE THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE ERRORS- BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION- AND I THINK THAT THAT PUTTING ALL THAT TOGETHER. IS REALLY IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENT AND SO- I WANT TO KEEP COMING BACK TO THE PATIENT BECAUSE IT IS REALLY ALL ABOUT THE PATIENT. AND THE DATA IS THEIR DATA AND ALL THE ALL THE SYSTEMS AND ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE. ARE THE CUSTODIANS SO NEVER FORGET THAT PART OF IT- AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A REALLY A REALLY IMPORTANT THINGAND I THINK IT'S- YOU KNOW IT I THINK JUST A GENERAL COMMENT HERE ABOUT THAT IS IT. IT IS- IT IS DISCONCERTING. TO NOTE THAT I. COULD GO TO ANOTHER PART OF THE STATE THE STATE. AND HAVE TO SEE A MEDICAL PROVIDER THAT IS OUTSIDE OF MY CURRENT MEDICAL SYSTEM THAT HAS A PRETTY GOOD HAS A REALLY GOOD ROBUST. RECORD SYSTEM WITH IN THAT SYSTEM. AND THAT PROVIDER MAY HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME ACCESSING THAT INFORMATION ESPECIALLY IF I WAS UNCONSCIOUS AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I CAME FROM- BUT THEY WOULD THEY WOULD MIGHT KNOW MY NAME AND MY AND BE ABLE TO ACCESS INFORMATION THAT WAY BUT- BUT THE LACK OF ABILITY FOR INFORMATION TO FLOW IN A WAY. THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO- TO GET THE APPROPRIATE CARE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME IS WHAT IS DRIVING- DRIVING THIS THIS MIGHT MY DESIRE TO DO SOMETHING- SOMETHING MORE ABOUT THAT- AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE MOVE AROUND IN THE STATE AND- AND THEY- AND IN JUST BECAUSE THEY DO DOESN'T MEAN. THEY SHOULD. HAVE TO NOT GET THE OPTIMAL MEDICAL CARE BECAUSE A DOCTOR A HOSPITAL OR CLINIC OR WHATEVER CAN'T GET THE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR HEALTH HISTORY IN A TIMELY WAY THAT'S COMPLETE ENOUGH TO PAINT A PICTURE TO ALLOW PROPRIA CARE DELIVERY TO HAPPEN SO- THAT'S I WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS. THAT IS WHAT'S DRIVING YOU KNOW WHAT I'M WHAT I'M LOOKING AT LOOKING AT HERE SO HIS HIDE SORRY I WENT UP A LITTLE BIT ON A RANT THERE BUT- BUT THAT'S LIKE I WANT TO BRING IT BACK TO THAT- AND- TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. SO MY I HAVE A QUESTION FOR A C. PAN. I THINK IT'S A SANTA SANTA SANTA THINK OF IF I'M RIGHT CAN'T RMEMBER I APOLOGIZE- SO THE INTEGRATION OF. HEALTH SERVICE. SERVICES IS THE CENTRAL FOCUS OF CALAMP. AND THAT'S A THAT'S AN AMBITIOUS PROJECT WE'RE USING TO ROUTE TO REALLY RE ORGANIZE OUR MEDICAL SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA- ON THAT. THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES. SO TO WHAT EXTENT SHOULD WE BE THINKING OF EXPANDING HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE TO INVOLVE NONTRADITIONAL PROVIDERS SUCH AS HOUSING AGENCIES. FOOD BANKS. AND THINGS THAT- THAT WE WOULD WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE AS TOOLS TO ADDRESS THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION I THINK THAT'S A GREAT. QUESTION WITH THE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND CONVERSATION- AND WE'RE SEEING THESE TYPES OF YOU KNOW COMMUNITY EXCHANGES ALREADY- IN THE INVOLVEMENTS WORLD AND- YOU KNOW WE LOOK A WHOLE PERSON CARE AND WE LOOK AT THE WAY. ON SOME OF THESE SYSTEMS ARE BEGINNING TO COMMUNICATE- ACROSS MEDICAL RECORDS YOU KNOW WITH- SOCIAL SERVICES AND HELPING FOLKS TO MAKE THOSE LINKAGES AND HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE TECHNOLOGY IS A GREAT. WAY TO- A VEHICLE PERHAPS TO THE EXTENT THAT- I THINK YOU KNOW THEM AS I MENTIONED BEFORE JUST. YOU KNOW BEARING IN MIND AND THERE ARE YOU KNOW- APPLICATION- PROGRAM- API TECHNOLOGY THAT'S IMPORTANT SHE UTILIZED IN THE SITUATION SO THAT. YOU KNOW OUR OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS ARE MEDICAL SYSTEM AND- THE FOLKS WHO ARE PART OF THE HEALTHCARE TEAM CAN ACCESS THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED. TO DO THEIR JOBS AND CONNECT PEOPLE TO THE SERVICES. PARTICULARLY YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CALLING IN THE NEW AND LOUIS SERVICES THE INTENSE CARE MANAGEMENT SERVICES- THAT WILL HELP IMPROVE THEIR CARE AND THEIR OUTCOMES SO- ABSOLUTELY I THINK THIS IS A GREAT- USED FOR HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGES REALLY THINKING ABOUT. THIS COMMUNITY- DATA SHARING AND THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND TO. YOU KNOW CONNECT- PATIENTS WITH ASPEN THE SOCIAL SERVICES AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU- IF I HOPE A MISTER MCNAUGHTON IF YOU'RE STILL ON I DO HAVE A QUESTION I KNOW- YOU MIGHT. YOU KNOW MIGHT NEED TO JUMP OFF SOON BUT. I HAD SOME IF YOU'RE STILL OUT THERE. HE'S GONE OKAY OKAY- THAT'S THAT'S FINE I WILL FOLLOW UP WITH HIM LATE SO- QUESTION I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR A DOCTOR'S JUAREZ- IF YOU'RE STILL THERE. HI YES- YES DOCTOR WITH A SINGLE PAYER THANK YOU SO. THE WAY I HEARD I HEARD FROM FROM RIVERSIDE WE HEARD FROM THE RIVERSIDE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THAT YOUR HOSPITAL DOESN'T PARTICIPATE IN THEIR SYSTEM THERE- SO JUST IN GENERAL HOWWOULD KAISER NO IF A KAISER. IN ROWLEY RECEIVED CARE LET'S SAY KOBE TEST OUTSIDE YOUR CURRENT SYSTEM. WELL I WANTED TO MAKE A POINT ABOUT THAT- COMMENT BECAUSE I THINK- WHAT DID THE- EXCHANGES HIGHLIGHTING IS THE ABILITY FOR AN ORGANIZATION TO BE A PART OF FOR EXAMPLE IN NATIONAL- NETWORK A NATIONAL HRD NETWORK LIKE EHEALTH EXCHANGE YOUR AIR QUALITY OR- COMMA WELL OR ON ONES. AND STILL BE ABLE TO CONNECT THROUGH THAT WITH THE- LOCAL REGIONAL HIV THAT IS. ALSO CONNECTED TO THAT NATIONAL NETWORK- SO THAT IS A WAY THAT WE- SEE AT THE- VIABLE WAY IN THE FACT THAT THE WAY WE- CONNECT TO MANY OF OUR PROVIDERS TO- THE DIFFERENT NATIONAL NETWORKS THAT EXIST AND- WITH SOME OF THE REGIONAL NETWORK AS WELL SO- SO I THINK I THINK. MY POINT WHAT PRETTY TO HIGHLIGHT HOW. STILL THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO INTERCONNECT THE CHINESE I'M THRILLED THAT INTERCONNECTION AVE TAKE PARTICIPANTS TOOK TO EACH OTHER AND SO THAT. EACH OF THE PARTICIPANT DOESN'T HAVE TO REALLY PARTICIPATE IN EVERY ONE OF THE HIV THAT COULD NOT HAPPEN IN A PARTICULAR LOCATION. SO RIVERSIDE COULD GET YOUR INFORMATION. BUT THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH A THIRD PARTY THIRD PARTY ESSENTIALLY AN AND THEY COULD BRING THEIR BORDERS SO YEAH I MEAN IT JUST LIKE- ANY PROVIDER INSIDE DATA IN THEM THE RIVER SIDE H. ID LIKE TO GO THROUGH THEY RIVERSIDE HIV AS A THIRD PARTY INTERFACE. OR NETWORK. HI THERE CONNECT TO A NATIONAL NETWORK. I'M THROUGH THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THOSE TWO HIV IS THAT THE RIVERSIDE PROVIDER CAN TALK TO THE CHRYSLER PROVIDER OR VICE VERSA. SO WHY NOT JUST WHEN I JUST PARTICIPATE WITH WITH RIVERSIDE WHITE WHITE WHITE WHY DON'T WHY DON'T YOU PARTICIPATE. WELL I THINK WE DON'T CONNECT TO RIVERSIDE- WE ALSO CONNECT TO THE NATIONAL NETWORK AND IF THE QUESTION BECOMES REALLY WHICH- VEHICLE DO YOU USE TO. AUTOMATICALLY REACH THE OTHER PROVIDER THAT YOU NEED TO REACH TO- WHETHER YOU USE IT TO DO DO IT THROUGH DAVIS- HIV TO HIV CONNECTIONS OVER THEY DO JOIN A PARTICULAR HIV. AND EXCHANGE DATA WITH THEM- AND SO THOSE ARE YOU KNOW. TO BUY A WEIGHT OF- EXCHANGING THE INFORMATION AT THE END AS YOU POINTED OUT DR WITH IMPORTANT THING IS TO BE ABLE TO DO IT ALL. BASICALLY DELIVER THE RIGHT CARE TO THE RIGHT PERSON AND CHIEVING THAT INTERCONNECTION AND ACHIEVING THAT EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION- BY CONNECTING YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENT HIV- IT'LL COMMITTEE WHAT. WOULD WHAT. WOULD SERVE DOUBLE SPACING. IT FEELS A LOT CONTRA- IT DOESN'T FEEL VERY SEAMLESS. SO LIKE I GUESS I GUESS. THAT'S IT JUST DOESN'T IT DOESN'T FEEL VERY SEAMLESS SO- SO AND IT JUST. KIND OF YOU KNOW THERE. AND IT DIDN'T JUST TO FOLLOW UP THE OTHER INTERESTING. ASPECT OF THE TECHNOLOGY NOWADAYS IS THAT- THROUGH NEWER TECHNOLOGY AND TO YOUR TO YOUR EXAMPLE THAT YOU GAVE ABOUT A PATIENT- GOING TO A POVIDER AND THE PROVIDER TRYING TO ACTIVATE A FROM ANOTHER PROVIDER I THINK WITH THE NEW REQUIRE- TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITIES- THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS ARE ARE MANDATING SPECIFICALLY THE USE OF API. AND THE REQUIREMENT TO EXPOSE START TO MAKE AVAILABLE VIA API TOPIC CALL THE U. S. SIDII AY OR THE UNITED STATES COURT DATA FOR INTER OPERABILITY WHICH CONSTITUTE BASICALLY HEY- DETAILED SUMMARY OF THE- MEDICAL RECORD OF A PATIENT. I THINK- YOU KNOW PROVIDE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO. ACTON DATA IN REAL TIME THROUGH THE STATE YEAH I FROM OTHER PROVIDERS. BECAUSE PROVIDERS ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO MAKE THAT DATA AVAILABLE AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT AN API PLATFORM THAT ALLOWS OTHERS TO ACT. I THINK I THINK WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE IN THE NEAR FUTURE- A DESTRUCTIVE CAPABILITY. THROUGH API TO ACTIVE IN REAL TIME DATA ABOUT ANYONE IN A SECURE MANNER- WITH THE APPROPRIATE- YOU KNOW. A PROTECTION PLAN ON ALL THAT SO I THINK THAT IS A VERY DIFFERENT WAY. OF CONSIDERING BATES TRADITIONAL CONCEPT OF. SENDING A QUERY AND WAITING FOR A RESPONSE TO COME BACK. OR ITS SUMMARY DATA TO COME BACK INTO- COMPLEX- DATA STRUCTURE FORMAT. AND HAVING TO RECEIVE THAT DATA AND OPEN IT AND REVIEW IT. IN ANOTHER CHRONIC- OF BIO AT THE OTHER END I THINK BIG MEAL API TECHNOLOGIES ARE USING YOU AT TI ARE GOING TO. THEY'RE VERY QUICKLY DESCRIBE WAY. WORTH THINKING THAT THE YOU KNOW TRADITIONAL MODELS OF HIV. SO HOW HOW NOW DO YOU AT WITH KAISER INTEGRATE NETWORK SERVICES- OUT OF NETWORK SERVICES WITH YOUR ENROLLEE SAY SOMEONE GOES OUT OF NETWORK FOR SOMETHING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH RELATED HOW DO YOU EXCHANGE INFORMATION BACK AND FORTH THERE THAT DOES THAT DOES THAT DOES IS THAT CAN THE PROVIDER ACCESS INFORMATION ABOUT THE PATIENT DO YOU GET DO YOU GET INFORMATION FROM THE PROVIDER HOW DOES THAT WORK- SENT IT IN IN. YES WELL YES WE DO CONNECT TO OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS THAT THEY MENTIONED WE- HAVE OVER TWENTY SIX HUNDRED- OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDER OR NON KAISER PROVIDERS- WE USE- HORRIFIED. SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF WE USE FOR EXAMPLE SOMETHING CALLED DIRECT EXCHANGE- TOOLS- COMMUNICATE WITH SOME OF THE PROVIDERS WE USE THE. WE NEED TO HEY- PROVIDER THAT IS USING ALSO THE SAME- YOU KNOW ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM THAT WE USE- MEANING BASICALLY AN EPIC PRODUCT WE USE THE EPIC NETWORK TO CONNECT TO THEM AS WELL SO WE HAVE WE REACHED THE PROVIDERS THAT WE NEED TO COMMUNICATE WITH- IN DIFFERENT WAYS- AND- IN A MANNER THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THAT. AND SO DID YOU KNOW. BY I SAID WE HAVE. A HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLION- INSTANCES OF EXCHANGING DATA GAP IN CALIFORNIA YEP IN TWENTY TWENTY- THROUGH THE VARIOUS NETWORKS YOU KNOW USING. FAQ HEALTH EXCHANGE WHICH IS THE NATIONAL NETWORK DIRECT EXCHANGES- CAREQUALITY- AND ALL THOSE OTHER ENTITIES THAT AE IN ALL THE OTHER. ARE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE BACK WITH UP SO THIS. TRULY WORKING I MEAN IF THAT IF THAT IS THE REALITY. SO YEAH I IN YOUR IN YOUR COMMENTS YOU SAID THAT YOU BELIEVE THE SYSTEM IS AND I QUOTE. WHAT I HEARD IS ROBUST AND WORKS WELL. BUT YET YOU JUST ILLUSTRATED FOR DIFFERENT. WAYS THAT AN OUTSIDE OF OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDER MIGHT HAVE TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU THAT DOESN'T FEEL VERY SEAMLESS. AND I'D NOT SURE THAT. THAT WHAT WOULD BE THE WHAT IS THE OBJECTION THEN TO AN INTEGRATED STATEWIDE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE. THAT IS A SINGLE POINT. OF INFORMATION. WELL I THINK THEY DIDN'T GET BETTER I MEAN I THINK THAT TURNITIN OR THEIR OPPORTUNITY FOR THE- TWO- ELIMINATE ALL THE NETWORKS AND YES THAT LEAVES ONE- THAT EVERYBODY USES IN THIS STATE AND I THINK. WE HEARD THROUGHOUT THE TESTIMONY OF SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL. HOW THAT. I MEAN THAT THAT'S I MEAN BASICALLY EVERYBODY TALKED ABOUT THE NEED TO LEVERAGE DAY INVESTMENT THAN THE PERSPECTIVE THAT WE'VE DONE. AND EVEN THOUGH IT DOES NOT SEEM LESS I THINK IT IS MORE SIMPLIFIED THAT NEED. IT IS THE PERCEIVED. I'M I THINK IT WITH THE NEWER TECHNOLOGIES THE NEW YORK I DID USE OF IT REQUIRE API INTERFACE AND- HM SEVEN FIVE STANDARDS AND- AND THE DATA THAT THE U. S. T. I. DATA SAID. I THINK IT'S EVEN GOING TO BE MORE SEAMLESS TO. ACHIEVE THAT AND SO PEOPLE AT THE END ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO. RIGHT NOW WE COMMIT WE CONNECT TO FOR FIVE DAYS OF THE BIG MAJOR NATIONAL NETWORK. I THINK ONE OF THE GOALS IN THE FUTURE THROUGH NATIONAL EFFORTS BIKE- THE TRUSTED EXCHANGE FRAMEWORK. AND COMMON AGREEMENT EACH THAT PEOPLE WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO- YOU KNOW JOIN ONE. HIV THE LAW H. I. ORIGINALLY YES THEY THEY TELL YOU. HIV I WILL BE ABLE TO COME. WITH ANYBODY ELSE NOT JUST THE ONE LOCAL. REGIONAL OR STATE OKAY BUT A THE NATION SO- IT IN REALITY THE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN THE NETWORKS. IS WORKING IN WORKING MOST MORE SEAMLESSLY THAT IT. APPEARS IT IS PERCEIVED TO BE COMPLEX BECAUSE THERE'S MULTIPLE NETWORKS CONNECTED BUT- THERE ARE MANY I GET EXAMPLES IN OTHER INDUSTRIES WHERE DEATH IS THE PAINT MULTIPLE NETWORKS CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER AND STILL WORKING- SO ANYWAY I BELIEVE THAT- FROM. OUR PERSPECTIVE- THAT THERE IS REALLY NO NEED TO RIP UP REFUND REPLACE ALL THESE EFFORTS THAT HAVE HAPPENED AND DEDICATE THE READY NOT LIKE TO RIVERSIDE AND LIKE ALL OTHER ONES- I'M TRYING TO CREATE. A NEW STATEWIDE SINGLE CENTRALIZED SYSTEM. THAT WORKS PRIMARILY WITHIN CALIFORNIA. I'M WHENEVER THERE'S SOMETHING OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA THEN THAT MIGHT BE CONNECTED TO OTHER NETWORK OF WELL WHAT THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING. WITH THE NATIONAL NETWORK. I THINK THAT THE CHAO IS AND I GO BACK TO- THE FACT THAT THERE ARE AREAS OF THE STATE THAT ARE NOT IS INTEGRATED AS AND THAT THE SYSTEM ISN'T AS ROBUST AND ISN'T WORKING AS WELL AS YOU AS YOU. AS AS YOU HAVE SAID. OUR TO THE BAY AREA ARE NOT CONNECTED. THEY'RE NOT THEY DON'T COULD THEY DON'T COMMUNICATE WELL PARTS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THE INLAND EMPIRE ARE NOT CONNECTED AND THEY DON'T THEY DON'T WORK REALLY WELL. SO IN SPITE OF YOUR BELIEF THAT THE SYSTEM IS ROBUST AND WORKS WELL IT'S NOT WORKING WELL FOR EVERYONE IT MIGHT BE YOU KNOW YOUR SYSTEM MAY BE WORKING WELL FOR YOU. AND OTHER HEALTH SYSTEMS MAYBE WORKING WELL FOR THEM BUT IT'S NOT ALL WORKING WELL FOR EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA. YOU SAID YOU YOU **** YOU YOU YOU CONTRACT OUT WITH ARE YOU WORK AT WITH TWENTY SIX HUNDRED OUTSIDE PROVIDERS I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE NUMBER YOU GAVE ME. OVER TWENTY. TWENTY SIX HUNDRED. RIVERSIDE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAS FOUR THOUSAND. DOCTORS WE PROBABLY HAVE IN THE STATE. SIXTY SEVENTY EIGHTY THOUSAND MEDICAL PROVIDERS. BUT YOU'RE ONLY TALKING TO TWENTY SIX HUNDRED YOU SAID. YOU ONLY CUT SO ON THAT DOES IT FEEL TERRIBLY COLLABORATIVE SO THAT'S THE POINT. SO WHAT. AND WHEN I THINK TWENTY SIX HUNDRED ON THE TWENTY FIFTH THE DIVISIONAL POSITION- I MEAN FOR RIVERSIDE HAS MORE HOUSING SITE HAS FOUR THOUSAND SO. YEAH I AM GOING TO SPEND SOME SOME OF THESE PROVIDERS ARE PROVIDER GROUPS THAT HAVE MULTIPLE PHYSICIANS OR OTHER. PRACTITIONERS THAT ARE PART OF A- PROVIDER GOING TO GO THAT WE CONNECT- I ALSO KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH FRIENDS THAT YOU KNOW YOUR EVEN YOUR SYSTEM DOESN'T COMMUNICATE WELL WITH ONE ANOTHER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA DOESN'T COMMUNICATE VERY WELL WITH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND SO IF YOU'RE MOVED TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE YOU MOVED TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA GETTING YOUR HEALTH RECORD LINKED UP WITH YOUR SYSTEMS ISN'T SEAMLESS EITHER SO EVEN WITHIN YOUR OWN SYSTEM YOU HAVE CHALLENGES- SO. YEAH IT WILL BE LOOKING AT A GROUP THAT GIVE IT IS IT. A CHALLENGE IT IS A- KNOWN PROBLEM. AND THE REASON IT IS AND NOT BECAUSE OF THE SYSTEM'S NOT BEING ABLE TO INTEGRATE ITSELF THEMSELVES IT'S ACTUALLY. BECAUSE OF- MORE OF A TRAINING ISSUE WITH OUR PROVIDERS MANY OF OUR PROVIDERS. DON'T SEE A PATIENT ACROSS REGIONS- THAT OFTEN AND SO YOU KNOW THEY MIGHT SEE ONE EVERY SIX MONTHS AND- WHATEVER THEY SEE A NEW ONE A NEW ONE- THEY DON'T. REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT IT DID WORK FLOW PROCESS THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE RECORDS THAT THE DIRECTORS BEHIND IT SCENE TOP THREE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THE MEETING BASICALLY ON THE BACKGROUND. ARE ELECTRONICALLY CONNECTED THAT THE ISSUE IS REALLY IN THE FRONT AND THE PROVIDER NOT NECESSARILY NOT THE RIGHT WORKFLOW AYE DADDY THINK TRAINING ISSUE THAT WE ARE. CONSTANTLY WORKING ON AND I NEEDED TO AN UNDERSTANDABLE TO QUESTION THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM MANY MEMBERS AND WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS IT IN. THE IN THAT WAY IN MAKING SURE THAT OUR PROVIDERS REMEMBER UNDERSTAND ALL HOW TO INTEGRATE THE TWO RECORDS I NEED THIS HAPPENS. NOT JUST BETWEEN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAPPENS BETWEEN. OUR DIFFERENT REGIONS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES SO- BUT ANY OF THAT SITUATION THAT YOU HAVE TO DO MORE WITH- TRAINING AND THE YOU KNOW THE ABILITY FOR PROVIDED TO DO IT BUT IT IT IS YEAH WELL YOU KNOW. A GOOD POINT THAT AND CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE. UNDERSTAND IT THAT. SO I GUESS IT I GUESS TO ME I GUESS IT'S MAKES THINK THE MAYBE A SINGLE SAYS. THAT EVERYBODY PARTICIPATED IN MIGHT ACT. SOLVE PROBLEM FOR YOU AND SOLVE OTHER PROBLEMS FOR EVERYONE ELSE AS WELL BUT- JUST JUST JUST MIGHT JUST MY THOUGHTS SO- SO THANK YOU I APPRECIATE PREFIGURE ANSWERS VERY MUCH THANK YOU. AND THEN A QUESTION FOR- I'M WITH PARK PARTNERSHIP IF- YOU MISTER MORRIS IF HE'S STILL THERE. DR SIR ROGER MOORE WE'RE SORRY MY APOLOGIES. SO JUST ENTER ON WHOLE PERSON CARE- CAN YOU ELABORATE ON. ON SOME OF YOUR EXPERIENCES. WITH WHOLE PERSON CARE AND HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE. SO- SIX OF OUR COUNTIES ARE PARTICIPATING IN WHOLE PERSON CARE AND SO WE ARE DOING OUR- PLANNING BECAUSE AS OF JANUARY FIRST WE WILL BE NEEDING TO TRANSITION THEM INTO THE- AND HAVE CASE MANAGEMENT- PORTION OF CAL AIMS SO IN PREPARATION FOR THAT WE'VE WE'VE GOT WE'VE ALWAYS MAINTAINED CONTACT BECAUSE THERE'S SOME DATA EXCHANGE WE ALREADY- NEED THEY NEED CERTAIN DATA FROM US WE SEVEN ON A REGULAR BASIS- THAT TO BE ABLE TO HELP STRATIFY THEIR PATIENTS AND FIGURE OUT WHO THAT THEY NEED TO ASSIGN SO WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT. ALONG BUT- WE'RE LOOKING TOWARDS THE FUTURE AND LOOKING AT- WHAT KINDS OF DATA EXCHANGE WE NEED TO DO TO OVERSEE THE ENHANCED CASE MANAGEMENT- BENEFIT THAT'S COMING ON IN JANUARY WITH THE WHOLE PERSON CARE COUNTIES DURING THAT PROCESS WE'VE INVESTIGATED. I YOU KNOW WHAT EXACTLY WHAT DATA EXCHANGES DO THEY HAVE SO FOR EXAMPLE IN- IN- IN MARIN COUNTY THEY HAVE A DATE CHANGE WITH THE LOCAL HOSPITAL TO GET TO FIND OUT WHEN THE PATIENTS HAVE BEEN- ADMIT ADMITTED DISCHARGED AND THEY HAVE AND THAT'S REAL IMPORTANT FOR YOU KNOW DOING FOR THESE HIGH RISK PATIENTS AND THEN THEY ALSO HELP US AT THE EXCHANGE WITH THEIR HOUSING. MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM- AND SO THEY THEY THEY FOUND OUT THAT THOSE ARE SORT OF A TWO CORE INTERFACES DAY THAT THEY MOST NEED NOW- THAN CONGRESSIONAL MY COUNTY INTERFACE WITH A NUMBER OF COUNTY LEVEL- A SOCIAL SERVICE FUNCTIONS THAT ARE WITHIN THEIR COUNTY SYSTEMS AND THEY STILL HAVE A LONG. LIST OF FUTURE ONES THEY'D LOVE TO DO BUT THEY'VE DONE A LOT OF THEM AND REALLY FOCUSED ON THAT BUT THEY BEGIN THE THING I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT IS THAT IF YOU HAVE A BASIC CASE MANAGEMENT FUNCTION YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND THEN YOU SPEND A LOT OF EFFORT TO BRING IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT DATA STREAMS. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT DATA WILL BE USED OR OR REVIEWED REGULARLY ARE ACTED UPON IT THAT DATA ALONE WILL NOT CHANGE OUTCOMES THAT NEEDS TO BE IN THE IN IN THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF A INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT'S ABLE TO ANALYZE THE DATA THE- END OR- PRESENTED. IN A WAY THAT. YEAH USER FINE. THAT MEANING- FINDS YOU. AND OF. AND SO THAT'S WHAT I THE THINGS WE'VE- IS THE- THE DESIRE FOR DATA TO BE- AND- IN. JUST SO. SHE OUTCOME. DOESN'T LEAD TO THAT CHANGED OUR COMMUNITY TO ACTUALLY HELP THE UNDERLYING SYSTEMS OR COURT IT'S BETTER TO HAVE FEWER EXCHANGES. WITH A ROBUST SYSTEM THAN A LOT OF EXCHANGES WITH THE LESS. LESS ALIGNED. INCENTIVES UNLESS A ROBUST SYSTEM. SO FEWER SYSTEMS. SAVING HERE TO GREATNESS YES YOUR INTERPRETATIONS SO IT'S SO SINGLE SYSTEM WOULD BE MORE BENEFICIAL TO YOUR MODEL. WHOLE PERSON POPE PERSON CARE MODEL CORRECT WELL HERE'S THE THING- SO- EVERYONE OF THE WHOLE PERSON CARE COUNTIES THEY'RE FUNDAMENTALLY CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SO SIMILAR TO- AND SO THAT CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM COULD BE A STANDALONE SYSTEM LIKE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM BUT JUSTICE CASE MANAGEMENT OR MIGHT BE PART OF ANOTHER SYSTEM ONE COUNTY- USED THEIR PRIMARY CARE. HEALTH CENTERS IS THERE A PARTICULAR CONTRACT DIS AND THEY USE A CASE MANAGER SYSTEM THAT'S IMBEDDED IN THERE LIKE TRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM SO THOSE ARE THE END PRODUCTS SYSTEMS AND I KNOW WITH EACH AYE YOU'RE NOT PROPOSING THAT WE ALL THROUGHOUT OUR EIGHT YEAR MARCIN USE THE SAME PMR SURVEY THIS IS LIKE THEM HAVING THEIR OWN EMR. AND THE QUESTION IS HOW DO THEY INTERFACE WITH WITH OTHER- OTHER ENTITIES WITHIN THEIR WITHIN THEIR THEIR AREA IN THE PRIORITY I THINK IS THAT THAT HOSPITAL- JUST CHARGE ADMISSION INFORMATION IT'S ALL PART PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY A STEP NUMBER I MENTIONED A THIRD IT'S THE TRANCE STATE H. ARE YOU THAT- THE COLLECTIVE MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES- EVERY PLATFORM WHICH REALLY IS FOCUSED ON EMERGENCY ROOM HOSPITAL ADMISSION DISCHARGE TRANSFER WITH SOME CASE MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONALITY ON TOP OF IT. THAT'S GOOD DOT ONE INTERFACE- IT'S THE ONE THAT WERE PARTNERSHIP'S GONNA TRY TO PROMOTE YOUR WHOLE PERSON CARE AND NINETY CM A PROVIDERS. BECAUSE THAT WILL GIVE THEM. YOU JUST HEARD ST ON ALL BUT- TWO HOSPITALS THAT ARE. NETWORK PLUS- MOST HOSPITALS AND CAL. ALTHOUGH IN OREGON ALL HOSPITALS IN WASHINGTON STATE AND MANY HOSPITALS THROUGHOUT THE WESTERN AND- CENTRAL UNITED STATES SO IT'S A MUCH. BROADER CONSIDERING WONDER FACE WITH A MARIN COUNTY HOSPITAL FOR EXAMPLE THAT ONE INTERFACE WILL THEN GRAB TRICK BROWN CALL THAT EACH YEAR PERMISSION. FROM MULTIPLE MULTIPLE STATES POTENTIALLY SO THEY CAN GET ALERTS IF THE PATIENT IS A MATTER SHOWS UP IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM ANYWHERE. SO THAT'S THAT'S THE KIND OF STRATEGY WE'RE LOOKING AT IS TO REALLY LEVERAGE. CRITICAL INFORMATION EXCHANGES THAT ARE MOST NEEDED BUT NOT TRY TO GRAB THIS HUGE NET OF GATHERING. YOU KNOW AND- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT THEY DON'T FIND IS THIS. HIGH VALUE AND WHAT THE ACTUAL. OKAY THE THANK YOU- I PREFACE THAT THAT ANSWER VERY MUCH THANK YOU. I'M LOOKING TO SEE DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM OUR MEMBERS ARE WATCHING REMOTELY. NOT THIS POINT OKAY ALL RIGHT SO OKAY- THAT BEING SAID- I SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO OUR- OUR PANELISTS- TODAY I AM VERY MUCH APPRECIATE- APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS IN YOUR INPUT- THANK PEOPLE WHO HAVE WATCHED ME BEFORE KNOW THAT- I ASK OUR QUESTIONS- AND ASKING FOR- FOR REASON AND- WHAT DRIVES ME ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE IS. THE ABILITY FOR PATIENTS TO GET THE HIGHEST QUALITY MOST APPROPRIATE CARE- WITH THE LEAST DUPLICATION OF SERVICES POSSIBLE. BUT IT ALSO WHAT DRIVES ME ON THIS ISSUE IS. THE CHALLENGES THAT WERE SEEN IN KOBE- WERE WERE UNABLE TO EXCHANGE BASIC DATA- I A I DO WONDER- AND SMALLER PRACTICES- YOU KNOW WITHOUT PATIENCE REALLY TELLING THEIR DOCTORS- ABOUT YOU KNOW THEIR EXPERIENCES WITH COATED- THAT THEY MAY HAVE HAD- HOW DOES THAT INFORMATION GET TRANSFERRED- DOES THE DOCTOR KNOW WHICH VACCINE THEY GOT- AND I LOOK AT. I LOOK AT- A POTENTIAL FOR A SYSTEM WHERE. WE'RE WHEN EVERYTHING IS SAID AND DONE WE'RE ALL VACCINATED OF THOSE OF US WHO WHO CHOOSE TO BE VACCINATED. AND AND WE NEED TO WE'RE GONNA NEED TO KNOW- HOW LONG THAT VACCINE LAUGHS AND- AND SO THE DATA THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE TO US- IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. WE CAN'T QUERY WE CAN'T. DEVELOP POPULATION- HEALTH DATA WELL IN THE STATE RIGHT NOW WE CAN'T DO IT- AND SO CONSEQUENTLY WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING. IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WE CAN'T QUERY A SYSTEM THAT SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE INCIDENCE OF DIABETES IN THIS- ETHNICITY IN THIS COMMUNITY- AND WHAT ARE THE OUTCOMES WE CAN'T DO THAT KIND OF THING AND THAT'S WHY. THE INFORMATION THAT WE COULD POTENTIALLY GATHERED TO HELP IN THE LONG RUN- WITH HEALTH OUTCOMES IS A VITAL COMPONENT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT AND THE CHIEF HERE SO- YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THAT SOME OF THE OPTIONS FOR MOVING.

ENHANCE THE COORDINATION AMONG PROVIDERS TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE AND CONTROL OF THE SYSTEM OF CARE THAT ARE UNIQUE TO EACH COMMUNITY WITHOUT PUTTING AN UNDUE BURDEN. AND STRAIN ON THE ALREADY OVERBURDENED PROVIDER PATIENT POPULATION. FURTHERMORE COLLECTED MEDICAL RECOMMENDS THAT THE STATE ADOPTS THE FEDERAL DEFINITION OF H. I. E. WHICH IS INCLUSIVE OF MANY OF THE STATE. OF MANY OF THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OUR NEXT CALLER PLEASE. THANK YOU THAT COMES RELY FOR ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON ARE CARING SARKISSIAN WITH ANTHEM BLUE CROSS WE THANK THE CHAIRMAN THE COMMITTEE FOR THE DISCUSSION TODAY AND WE APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE ONGOING EFFORT TO ESTABLISH A STATE WIDE. HIV WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT PROPOSALS WHICH WILL HELP IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. REDUCE COSTS THROUGH THE SHARING OF HEALTH INFORMATION AND TRANSFORM CALIFORNIA'S COMPLEX HEALTHCARE SYSTEM INTO ONE THAT IS COORDINATED TRANSPARENT AND DELIVERS HIGHER QUALITY CARE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING HEALTH CARE SIMPLE.

ON THESE IMPORTANT EFFORT AIMED AT STRENGTHENING CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE AND INFRASTRUCTURE. AND DELIVERY SYSTEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOVE ONTO OUR NEXT CALLER PLEASE. AND THAT COMES FROM LINE TWENTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI AT THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE I'M JENNIFER STOLE. EVEY PEER GOVERNMENT RELATIONS FOR OCEAN WHERE NATIONAL NONPROFIT HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH NETWORK COMPRISED AT HEALTH COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S RESCUE FACILITIES IN. THESE LAST YEAR- TO MEMBERS OVER A MILLION PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH OVER SEVENTY UNIQUE HEALTH CENTERS AND WE MOVED OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE MILLION CLINICAL CARE SUMMARIES CAN PROVE COORDINATED CARE FOR A PATIENT. SO IF YOU WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THAT THE TAKING ON THE COMPLEX TOPIC OF HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE AND ARE EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS. TO HELP SET A STRONG A PATH FOR INFORMATION EXCHANGE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- WE MOVE A LOT OF DATA AS I MENTIONED AND WE EXCHANGED ACROSS FORTY SEVEN STATES SO AFTER THE REVISED CONVERSATION FROM THE PANEL TODAY WE WANT TO ADD A FEW POINTS- FOR CONSIDERATION FOR THE COMMITTEE AND THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT WE LIKE THE STATE TO CONSIDER IS ENSURING THAT ALL FEDERAL FUNDS. TO HELP- MALL RURAL AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES ACCESS HIGH QUALITY EHR SYSTEM OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO BE OPERABLE NEVER MIND INTEROPERABLE IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT THAT FOUNDATION HAVE TO BE THERE DOESN'T MATTER HOW STRONG YOUR INTERFACES IF YOU DON'T HAVE A STRONG EHR FIELD EXCHANGE DATA WITH. ITS AND THE POINT SO WE REALLY ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO LOOK FOR ALL FEDERAL FUNDS THAT ARE GOING TO COME DOWN THE PIKE AND I'M TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS WORK. ALSO MANY OF THE PROGRAMS ARE OVER TEN YEARS OLD AND SO MANY PROVIDERS ARE STILL ON OBSOLETE SYSTEMS. SO H. I. T. INFRASTRUCTURE IS FOUNDATIONAL TO INFORMATION EXCHANGE AT THE OTHER THING THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IT OTHER FUNDING SOURCES TO HELP SUPPORT COMMUNITY PROVIDERS IN THIS EFFORT AND ALSO TO ENSURE THAT PROVIDERS ARE HELD HARMLESS FROM CONNECTING TO. COMMUNITY AND HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE ORGANIZATIONS- MANY EACH TIME THEY ARE COVERED AND THERE ARE PRICE. IS AND SO WE AND THE- PROVIDERS ARE HELD HARMLESS FROM EXT. TO DATE EXTRA. FINALLY AT A DIRECT WEBER THE OF AN- AT STANDARDS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FOR- INSURE PROVIDE SECOND. WITH OUR IF I. A COMPLEX AND STATE LEGAL RIGHT. AND INCREASINGLY. EXCHANGE IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR LISTENING AND- WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING PART OF THE CONVERSATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT CALLER PLEASE. THANK YOU AND THAT COMES ONE THIRTY EIGHT. PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MURRAY A FORMER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WHICH THANK YOU FOR ASSEMBLING AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON SUCH A COMPLEX ISSUE. REALLY APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE WE TO BELIEVE OF STRONG SECURE EXCHANGE OF HEALTH INFORMATION DATA CAN BE A POWERFUL TOOL TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES REDUCE REDUNDANT CASTING AND LOWER HEALTHCARE COSTS OVERALL NCHA RECOGNIZES THE GREAT VALUE AND THAT'S THE QUESTION WE MUST EVALUATE WHAT CURRENT SYSTEMS EXISTING CALIFORNIA ACCOUNT FOR INFORMATION EXCHANGE GAP AND ANGEL LINE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ATTENDED. MANY HOSPITALS AND SYSTEMS REGIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATION PRIVATE VENDORS AND OTHERS IN CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY EXCHANGE HEALTH INFORMATION SECURELY AND PRIVATELY BANKS TO SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS MADE IN THE LAST DECADE THAT ALLOW FOR THE SHARING OF CLINICAL RECORDS THEIR OWN SYSTEM AND EACH OTHER. SH EFFORTS OF THIS AND FEDERAL LEVEL TO ENHANCE FROM EXCHANGE ARE WAY I COULD PROVIDE A LOOK PATH CAL. BUT IF BLOOD THAT ENSURE AND FOR WILL ALWAYS BE PROTECTED TO THAT END THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION RECOMMENDS THAT CALIFORNIA LEVERAGING ADVANCED NATIONAL STANDARDS FOR CLINICAL INFORMATION EXCHANGE WHICH WILL ENSURE ALL PARTICIPANTS AND THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM CAN DRAW ON CURRENT TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT TO BETTER SERVE PATIENTS. THIS WILL ENGENDER CONFIDENCE THAT WHEN EXCHANGING HEALTH INFORMATION THE INFORMATION WILL BE USED FOR PERFECT PERMITTED PERFECT WITH THE CORPORATE PRIVACY AND SECURITY CONTROL WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AS YOU EXAMINE NETWORK TO ENHANCE PATIENT CARE AND PROTECT THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK. YOU VERY MUCH NEXT CALLER PLEASE. THANK YOU AND THAT COMES FROM FOR FOUR LIVE FOUR YEAR LINE IS A- THANK YOU. WOULDN'T MEMBERS OF THE HEALTHCARE FELIX WITH. ACCOUNT TODAY ON HERE CRYSTAL DOT THE MOMENT ACT ON. A STATE WIDE HIV IN. AND REQUIREMENTS SHOULD IN NOW. AS A NON HEALTH SERVING OVER FORTY CAL. ACROSS MEDICARE MEDICARE HAVE A CALIFORNIA AN IMPORTANT MARKET. YOU SEE THE IMPERATIVE AND THE VALUE OF CREATING A HEALTH RECORD FOR A MEMBERS. THAT PROVIDE ACTIVE RELIABLE INFORMATION AND IMPROVE SAFETY CARE COORDINATION AND PATIENT EXPERIENCE. THIS IS A GAME CHANGER FOR EVERY CALIFORNIA TO HAVE A HEALTH HISTORY SHARED RELY WEEKS BETWEEN THE CARE PROVIDERS. AND HAVE A MORE PERSONALIZED. EXPERIENCE WITH THEIR HEALTH PLAN. IT IS HAPPENS AFTER WHY OF THE MOST. IMPORTANT THINGS WE CAN DO TO MODERNIZE THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND IMPROVE PATIENT CARE. WE DEEPLY APPRECIATED LEADERSHIP AND AUTHORING LEGISLATION DR WHAT AND FULLY SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S ONLINE VISION IN HIS JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL. AS DISCUSSIONS ON APPROACHES CONTINUE WE ARE FRIENDLY WAY TO CERTAIN KEY CONCEPTS. FIRST EVERY PARTICIPANT IN THE CARE CONTINUUM FROM MAJOR PROVIDER SYSTEMS TO HELP PLANTS LIKE OURSELVES SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO SHARE ALL THE DATA NECESSARY. TO FORM A COMPLETELY STANDARDIZED PATIENT HISTORY. WE THINK THEY SHOULD BE BUILT INTO CONTRACTS FOR PARTICIPATING IN MEDIC CALCUTTA CALIFORNIA CALPERS AS WELL AS THE APPROPRIATE FINANCIAL TECHNICAL SUPPORT. FOR SMALL PRACTICES TO CONNECT. SECOND THEY NEED TO H. LIKE AND TO CLEAN AND PREPARE THE DATA WHAT IT IS RECEIVE DIRECTLY PROVIDER AND PLANS OR THROUGH. REGIONAL NETWORKS THAT CONNECT TO THAT ENTITY. AS WELL TO MAXIMIZE FEDERAL FUNDS TO ADVANCE THIS PRIORITY AS AN INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT. LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE THIS CRITICAL REFORM OR REALITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NEXT CALLER PLEASE. THANK YOU AND AGAIN IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE A COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND OUTLINED FORTY SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS IS DEVIN MCGRAW AND THE CHIEF REGULATORY OFFICER AT A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY CALLED CITIZEN WHICH IS LOCATED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WHERE A PLATFORM THAT ENABLES PATIENTS. TO GATHER ALL THEIR HEALTH INFORMATION SO THEY HAVE AT THEIR FINGERTIPS THINKING SEEK ADDITIONAL CARE OPTIONS. SHARE INFORMATION WITH THEIR TREATING PHYSICIANS ARE LEFT ONCE OR EVEN TO CONTRIBUTE THEIR DATA FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES. PATIENTS OF COURSE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE THE ONES TO HIS SHERPA AROUND ALL OF THEIR DATA TO ALL OF THEIR CARE PROVIDERS. ON THE OTHER HAND MANY PATIENTS DO YOU WANNA PLAY A VERY ACTIVE ROLE IN THEIR CARE PARTICULARLY WHEN THEY ARE VERY SICK. THEY HAVE LOVED ONES WHO WANT TO HELP ONE TO HELP THEM FIND TREATMENT OPTIONS. AND PATIENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS THEIR DATA BUT THIS IS VERY HARD FOR PATIENTS TO DO TODAY BECAUSE- THEY HAVE MANY PROVIDERS AS YOU POINTED OUT SO IT'S TOO EARLY- DURING THE HEARING DOCTOR WOULD AND YET- HOW EASY HOW MUCH EASIER WOULD IT BE FOR THEM IF THEY CAN CONNECT INTO AN EIGHTEEN AT WORK. CAN BE ABLE TO ACCESS DATA FROM ALL THEIR PROVIDERS VERSUS. HAVING TO GO POINT TO POINT TO POINT. BUT EVEN WORKSTATION ARE NOT. IN IN IN THIS WOULD HAVE THEIR OWN AND PRINT. IT IS. CRITICAL FOR THERE TO BE A STATEWIDE HIV NETWORKING CALIFORNIA SO THAT. DATA CAN BE LEVERAGED FOR INDIVIDUAL AND POPULATION HEALTH. I WAS VERY- EVIDENT FROM THE HEARING. MUCH OF WHAT BARS THAT. IF THE IF THE STATE WIDE EXCHANGE OF DATA THAT NEEDS NOT JUST PRIVATE INTERESTS BUT THE INTERESTS OF THE PUBLIC. IN SHARING DATA IS. BUSINESS TRUST. NOT NECESSARILY PRIVACY BUT BUSINESS TRUST WHICH IS ALL THE MORE REASON WHY. WHY THE LEGISLATION YOU'RE CONSIDERING IS IT IS ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT- BECAUSE IT WILL TAKE IN THE AGE. FRANKLY AND SOME STRONG INCENTIVES OR SOME SORT OF MANDATE FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. AND WE KEEP UP WITH THAT GOING ON BUT RESPECTED THE FEDERAL LAWS AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT IN WHAT IS BEING CONSIDERED HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS. IS UNLIKELY TO MAKE THOSE FEDERAL LAWS WORK BETTER. BECAUSE ON PROVIDERS ARE ALL CONNECTED INTO EACH CHINESE. VAN H. I. USED AGAIN CAN BE THAT FIRST ATTRACTED DATA. FOR A RANGE OF IMPORTANT PURPOSES. THE STATE OF THE ART. TO MAKE THE DISAPPEARING IN I APPRECIATE THAT THANK HAVE THAT HEARING AND I'M FORWARD CAN. THE GUY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT CALLER THANK YOU EN ROUTE. TO LINE FORTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI EVERYBODY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS HEARING THIS IS CLAUDIA WILLIAMS AND THAT'S PO OF MANIFEST MAX AND I REALLY JUST WANTED TO UNDERSCORE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN THAT BY OTHERS IN IN THE HEARING- I THINK THE CHALLENGE AHEAD OF US HAS LESS TO DO WITH MOVING DATA I THINK API THE NATIONAL NETWORKS. WILL MAKE THAT PROCESS EASIER AND EASIER TO DO OVERTIME IT HAS TO DO WITH POINT EDITED TOGETHER AND DR MARK SAID SO ELOQUENTLY EACH AND PULLING OUT THE INSIDER IMPORTANT SO- MANIFEST MINEX THE REASON WE WERE ABLE TO RUN A FULL REPORT OF THE COUNTY. OF RIVERSIDE IN JUST OVER A COUPLE DAYS TO HELP THE VACCINATORS TARGET THE PLUG THAT IN THAT MOMENT IT BECAUSE WE WERE ALREADY COLLECTING CONTACT INFORMATION WE WERE ALREADY COLLECTING HOSPITALIZATION WE ALREADY HAD ALL OF THE AND HEALTH INFORMATION AT OUR DISPOSAL. AND AS WE THINK ABOUT THE USE CASES THAT JONAS- HIGHLIGHTED THEY WILL ALL INVOLVED IN MANAGEMENT- SORTING MATCHING ATTRIBUTION CLEANING UP DATA FROM MANY SOURCES TO CREATE CLEAN AND UNIFIED RECORD AND THEN CREATING POPULATION LEVEL INFORMATION FUND THAT. THAT'S THE THING I WANT THE STATEWIDE ENTITY TO CREATE FOR THE STATE AND I THINK THEY'RE SMART WAYS FOR THAT TO BUILD ON THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE ALREADY HAVE THEIR SMART WAYS TO ACQUIRE DATA SHARING I THINK IT WILL REQUIRE. MANDATE AS WELL AS IN SAM. AND THEY'RE SMART WAYS TO DEPEND ON FEDERAL FUNDING BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE SOLVING THE RIGHT PROBLEM I AGREE COMPLETELY WITH WALTERS FLORIDA SHOULDN'T REPLICATE THE NATIONAL NETWORK BUT WHAT WE NEED TODAY IS A ROBUST STATE LIKE GETTING CHARITY THAT CONSERVES. THE CRITICAL USE CASES THAT JOHN THAT- THAT JENNA JENNA FRENCH THANK YOU SO MUCH I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING- CHIU SUPPORT AND I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT OF ALL THAT YOU'RE DOING SHERMAN WOULD AND FOR THIS CONVERSATION. IN CALIFORNIA TODAY THANK YOU THANK VERY MUCH- NEXT PLEASE. HEY WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE CAN KEEP. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL THANK AS AS A THANK YOU AGAIN TO A OVER WITH ARE FOR THE DISK- YOU KNOW AS THE GOAL OF THIS WAS TO TALK ABOUT PRIORITIES I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE DETAILS AROUND PRIVACY AND SECURITY AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT REALLY. IS A DISCUSSION FOR ANOTHER DAY BUT IS REALLY ABOUT THE PRIORITIES AND HOW WE CAN- LOOK AT WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND THAT'S- PATIENT DATA FOR QUALITY OF CARE- THE LESS DUPLICATION. ELIMINATION OF ERRORS JUST MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN GET THE MOST APPROPRIATE CARE AT THE TIME THAT IS AT IT WHERE THEY ARE WHERE THEY ARE WHEREVER THEY ARE IN THE STATE REGARDLESS OF THEIR IN SOMEBODY'S NETWORK OR OUTSIDE OF THE NETWORK SO. SO WITH THAT AND I KNOW THE DISCUSSION WILL CONTINUE- AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PARTICIPANTS AND WITH THAT WE WILL GO AHEAD AND DURING THE MEETING. THANK YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THAT DOES CONCLUDE.
