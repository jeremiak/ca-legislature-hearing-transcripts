SLIDE HERE SHOWS KIND OF. THE

00:31:10.802 --> 00:31:12.203
TREND IN THE NUMBER OF TOTAL

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:13.504
EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE AND

00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:14.672
BROKEN OUT BY THE SIZE OF THE

00:31:14.739 --> 00:31:15.974
EMPLOYER BASED ON HOW MANY

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.208
EMPLOYEES THEY HAVE AND A

00:31:17.275 --> 00:31:19.310
COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS HERE ONE

00:31:19.377 --> 00:31:20.979
IS THAT WE SEE THAT EMPLOYERS

00:31:21.045 --> 00:31:23.514
OF ALL SIZES- SAW HUGE

00:31:23.581 --> 00:31:25.516
DECLINES- EARLY ON IN THE IN

00:31:25.583 --> 00:31:27.785
THE PANDEMIC- ANOTHER NOTABLE

00:31:27.852 --> 00:31:29.354
AND THEN PERHAPS SOMEWHAT

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:30.255
SURPRISING THING IS THAT WE'VE

00:31:30.321 --> 00:31:31.923
SEEN. OF THE MOST RECOVERY

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:35.093
AMONG THE SMALLEST EMPLOYERS-

00:31:35.159 --> 00:31:36.561
AND THOSE WITH FEWER THAN TEN

00:31:36.628 --> 00:31:37.929
EMPLOYEES AT SOMETHING IN A

00:31:37.996 --> 00:31:39.264
KIND OF AN IMPORTANT NUANCE

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:41.266
HERE TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT

00:31:41.332 --> 00:31:43.134
THIS PROBABLY DOESN'T REFLECT-

00:31:43.201 --> 00:31:44.669
BUSINESSES THAT EXISTED PRE

00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:47.105
PANDEMIC THAT HAD TO SHUT DOWN

00:31:47.171 --> 00:31:47.705
BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC COMING

00:31:47.772 --> 00:31:50.375
BACK ONLINE- MORE LIKELY THIS

00:31:50.441 --> 00:31:50.975
REFLECTS THE FACT THAT WE'VE

00:31:51.042 --> 00:31:52.910
SEEN KIND OF A HEIGHTENED LEVEL

00:31:52.977 --> 00:31:54.579
OF NEW BUSINESS FORMATION

00:31:54.646 --> 00:31:56.314
DURING THE PANDEMIC IN A LOT OF

00:31:56.381 --> 00:31:58.416
THAT HAS BEEN- FOLKS WHO

00:31:58.483 --> 00:31:59.550
STARTED BUSINESSES THAT ARE

00:31:59.617 --> 00:32:01.519
CATERING TO THE WAY THAT PEOPLE

00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:03.354
AND BUSINESSES OF ADAPTED-

00:32:03.421 --> 00:32:04.989
THEIR PERSONAL AND WORK LIVES

00:32:05.056 --> 00:32:07.292
TO- KIND OF THE NEW REALITIES

00:32:07.358 --> 00:32:09.260
THE PANDEMIC IS CREATED SO. I

00:32:09.327 --> 00:32:10.428
JUST CONVERSING SOME OF THIS

00:32:10.495 --> 00:32:11.763
RECOVERY HERE IN THE SMALLEST

00:32:11.829 --> 00:32:16.501
EMPLOYERS DOESN'T NECESSARILY

00:32:16.567 --> 00:32:17.101
MEAN THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN A

00:32:17.168 --> 00:32:17.735
LOT OF BUSINESS IS THAT HAVE.

00:32:17.802 --> 00:32:18.369
CLOSED OVER THE DURATION OF A

00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:21.372
PANDEMIC THE SMALL BUSINESSES-

00:32:21.439 --> 00:32:24.075
TURNING THAN THE NEXT SLIDE. A

00:32:24.142 --> 00:32:25.643
SIMILAR PATTERN HERE WE ARE

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:26.978
LOOKING AT KIND OF TOTAL

00:32:27.045 --> 00:32:28.313
BUSINESS ENCUMBER PROPRIETORS

00:32:28.379 --> 00:32:29.447
INCOME WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY

00:32:29.514 --> 00:32:31.582
INCOME TO ALL NON CORPORATE

00:32:31.649 --> 00:32:34.018
BUSINESSES. WE SEE A SIMILAR

00:32:34.085 --> 00:32:35.586
PATTERN HERE WHERE BUSINESS

00:32:35.653 --> 00:32:37.322
INCOME DROPPED OFF MORE THAN

00:32:37.388 --> 00:32:39.023
20% EARLY ON IN THE PANDEMIC

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:41.025
AND IT HAS STARTED TO CLIMB

00:32:41.092 --> 00:32:43.061
BACK BUT EVEN STILL. ALL

00:32:43.127 --> 00:32:45.463
REMAINS WELL BELOW- KIND OF THE

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:46.631
LEVELS WE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED

00:32:46.698 --> 00:32:48.599
IF WE'D WRITTEN REMAINED ON THE

00:32:48.666 --> 00:32:50.201
PRE PANDEMIC GROWTH PATH WHICH

00:32:50.268 --> 00:32:51.469
YOU CAN SEE IS THAT KIND OF

00:32:51.536 --> 00:32:53.071
LIGHT BLUE LINE THERE ON THE

00:32:53.137 --> 00:32:54.839
CHARTS SO. STILL HAVE NOT

00:32:54.906 --> 00:32:56.974
RECOVERED. TO THE LEVELS WE

00:32:57.041 --> 00:33:00.611
WERE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC- SO

00:33:00.678 --> 00:33:03.881
BUT LOOKING A LITTLE MORE. IN

00:33:03.948 --> 00:33:05.917
DETAIL IT A COUPLE OF THE BIG.

00:33:05.983 --> 00:33:08.086
DRIVERS OF WHY WE SEEN A

00:33:08.152 --> 00:33:09.253
DECLINE EMPLOYERS WHY WE'VE

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.555
SEEN A DECLINE IN BUSINESS

00:33:10.621 --> 00:33:12.690
INCOME IF WE CAN. GO TO THE

00:33:12.757 --> 00:33:15.326
NEXT SLIDE- ONE OF THE KEY

00:33:15.393 --> 00:33:18.329
STORIES HERE IS THAT. THERE WAS

00:33:18.396 --> 00:33:20.698
A SUDDEN AND DRAMATIC DECLINE

00:33:20.765 --> 00:33:22.800
IN. CONSUMER SPENDING AND

00:33:22.867 --> 00:33:24.168
DEMAND EARLY ON IN THE PANDEMIC

00:33:24.235 --> 00:33:26.204
AND- THAT SUSTAINED A

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:28.673
PARTICULARLY FOR. CERTAIN

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.743
SECTORS. OF OVER MUCH OF THE

00:33:31.809 --> 00:33:35.246
LAST YEAR- AND SO YOU CAN SEE.

00:33:35.313 --> 00:33:36.848
WALL SPENDING. AMONG

00:33:36.914 --> 00:33:38.182
CALIFORNIANS IN AND SORRY LET

00:33:38.249 --> 00:33:39.517
ME BACK UP A LITTLE BIT THE

00:33:39.584 --> 00:33:42.120
START SHOWING. AND IT TOTALED A

00:33:42.186 --> 00:33:43.321
CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD SPENDING

00:33:43.388 --> 00:33:46.224
AMONG ALL CALIFORNIANS- YOU CAN

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:48.025
SEE TOTAL SPENDING WENT DOWN-

00:33:48.092 --> 00:33:49.093
BUT IT'S PARTICULARLY

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.162
PRONOUNCED FOR BUSINESSES IN

00:33:51.229 --> 00:33:52.430
THE LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY OR

00:33:52.497 --> 00:33:54.065
SO. RESTAURANTS HOTELS

00:33:54.132 --> 00:33:56.601
ENTERTAINMENT VENUES. OF HUGE

00:33:56.667 --> 00:33:58.503
DROP OFF IN SPENDING THEIR

00:33:58.569 --> 00:34:00.104
REMAIN DEPRESSED FOR MUCH OF

00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:01.038
THE LAST YEAR IN A LITTLE BIT

00:34:01.105 --> 00:34:02.840
OF A LITTLE BIT OF HOPE HERE AT

00:34:02.907 --> 00:34:04.876
THE END YOU CAN SEE HERE JUST.

00:34:04.942 --> 00:34:06.577
THE MOST RECENT DATA IN JUNE.

00:34:06.644 --> 00:34:08.379
DOES SO THAT WE ARE FINALLY

00:34:08.446 --> 00:34:10.515
STARTING TO SEE SOME RECOVERY

00:34:10.581 --> 00:34:11.816
IN SPENDING IN THOSE AREAS SO

00:34:11.883 --> 00:34:12.850
THAT'S A HOPEFUL SIGN AND

00:34:12.917 --> 00:34:15.787
SOMETHING TO FOLLOW GOING FOR

00:34:15.853 --> 00:34:16.954
BUT NONE THE LESS. THESE

00:34:17.021 --> 00:34:19.824
BUSINESSES HAVE DEALT WITH- YOU

00:34:19.891 --> 00:34:21.993
KNOW DEMAND FOR THEIR SERVICES

00:34:22.059 --> 00:34:24.262
BEING DEPRESSED WELL BELOW

00:34:24.328 --> 00:34:26.931
NORMAL LEVELS FOR OVER A YEAR-

00:34:26.998 --> 00:34:29.600
NEXT SLIDE- RELATED TO THIS

00:34:29.667 --> 00:34:33.204
STORY- IS. THAT TOURISM TO

00:34:33.271 --> 00:34:36.541
CALIFORNIA- SO HAS HAD A

00:34:36.607 --> 00:34:38.810
SIMILAR DRAMATIC FALL AT THE

00:34:38.876 --> 00:34:40.945
BEGINNING THE PANDEMIC. AND

00:34:41.012 --> 00:34:44.749
MAYBE UNLIKE THE SPENDING HAS

00:34:44.816 --> 00:34:47.285
STILL NOT RECOVERED- THIS THIS

00:34:47.351 --> 00:34:49.353
IS SHOWING. AIRLINE TRAVEL BOTH

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:50.955
DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TO

00:34:51.022 --> 00:34:53.958
CALIFORNIA BASED ON. SOME DATA

00:34:54.025 --> 00:34:56.127
FROM VISIT CALIFORNIA. AND

00:34:56.194 --> 00:34:57.261
AIRLINE TRAVEL FELL BY MORE

00:34:57.328 --> 00:34:59.197
THAN TWO THIRDS EARLY IN THE

00:34:59.263 --> 00:35:01.332
PANDEMIC AND IT'S STILL- MORE

00:35:01.399 --> 00:35:02.166
THAN A THIRD IN TERMS OF

00:35:02.233 --> 00:35:04.435
DOMESTIC TRAVEL BELOW WHERE IT

00:35:04.502 --> 00:35:06.704
WAS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC SO A

00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:09.307
LOT OF RECOVERY THERE. TO STILL

00:35:09.373 --> 00:35:11.175
BE HAD IN TERMS OF TOURISM- AND

00:35:11.242 --> 00:35:12.176
THIS IS AN AREA WHERE THE

00:35:12.243 --> 00:35:14.345
LEGISLATURE IS HAS ALREADY-

00:35:14.412 --> 00:35:15.947
TAKEN SOME ACTIVE INTERVENTION

00:35:16.013 --> 00:35:17.415
IN PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING

00:35:17.482 --> 00:35:18.749
TO VISIT CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE

00:35:18.816 --> 00:35:19.584
THROUGH THE BUDGET TO KIND OF

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:21.452
UP THE- THE STATE'S MARKETING

00:35:21.519 --> 00:35:23.921
EFFORTS THERE- AND ANOTHER THE

00:35:23.988 --> 00:35:24.689
SO THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING

00:35:24.755 --> 00:35:25.790
DEFINITELY TO KEEP AN EYE ON

00:35:25.857 --> 00:35:26.757
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT

00:35:26.824 --> 00:35:28.493
MOVING FORWARD TO SEE IF IT IS

00:35:28.559 --> 00:35:30.695
EFFECTIVELY. HELPING TO REVERSE

00:35:30.761 --> 00:35:32.864
THIS PATTERN. A COUPLE OF

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:35.500
OTHER. A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS

00:35:35.566 --> 00:35:37.301
FOR THE- THE COMMITTEE TO KEEP

00:35:37.368 --> 00:35:38.636
ITS EYE ON MOVING FORWARD TO

00:35:38.703 --> 00:35:40.872
FALL THE RECOVERY. OF OUR

00:35:40.938 --> 00:35:42.240
DEVELOPMENTS IN IN LABOR

00:35:42.306 --> 00:35:44.141
MARKETS AND WITH INFLATION SO

00:35:44.208 --> 00:35:44.675
IF WE COULD GO TO THE NEXT

00:35:44.742 --> 00:35:48.112
SLIDE- IN TERMS OF LABOR

00:35:48.179 --> 00:35:49.981
MARKETS A HOPEFUL SIGN IS THAT

00:35:50.047 --> 00:35:51.182
IN RECENT MONTHS WE'VE SEEN

00:35:51.249 --> 00:35:54.552
THAT. JOB OPENINGS- HAVE. GONE

00:35:54.619 --> 00:35:56.153
UP SIGNIFICANTLY AND IN FACT

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:57.622
AND IN MANY PARTS OF THE

00:35:57.688 --> 00:35:59.190
COUNTRY ARE AT KIND OF HISTORIC

00:35:59.257 --> 00:36:00.958
HIGHS. AT LEAST SINCE WE'VE

00:36:01.025 --> 00:36:03.995
BEEN TRACKING THIS DATA- AT THE

00:36:04.061 --> 00:36:06.430
SAME TIME. IF WE GO TO NEXT

00:36:06.497 --> 00:36:09.567
SLIDE AT THE SAME TIME-

00:36:09.634 --> 00:36:11.569
EMPLOYMENT IN THE MOST IMPACTED

00:36:11.636 --> 00:36:12.803
SECTORS LIKE LEISURE AND

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:14.005
HOSPITALITY WHICH WE'RE SEEING

00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:16.274
HERE REMAINS. A SIGNIFICANTLY

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:19.176
DEPRESSED- AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN

00:36:19.243 --> 00:36:20.811
QUITE THE REBOUND IN

00:36:20.878 --> 00:36:23.247
EMPLOYMENT. IN THE LEISURE AND

00:36:23.314 --> 00:36:25.316
HOSPITALITY SECTORS THAT WE

00:36:25.383 --> 00:36:26.017
WOULD EXPECT KIND OF

00:36:26.083 --> 00:36:29.120
COMMENSURATE WITH. THE UPTAKE

00:36:29.186 --> 00:36:31.155
AND JOB POSTINGS THE UPTICK IN

00:36:31.222 --> 00:36:34.258
DEMAND FOR- WORKERS AND THE

00:36:34.325 --> 00:36:34.892
DEMAND FOR THE SERVICES IN THIS

00:36:34.959 --> 00:36:37.628
SECTOR. SO THERE THERE DOES

00:36:37.695 --> 00:36:39.730
APPEAR TO BE SOME FRICTIONS

00:36:39.797 --> 00:36:40.798
PERHAPS SHORT TERM FRICTIONS

00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:43.868
IN- BRINGING WORKERS BACK INTO

00:36:43.935 --> 00:36:45.736
THESE BUSINESSES- AND THAT'S SO

00:36:45.803 --> 00:36:46.504
THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING I

00:36:46.571 --> 00:36:48.306
SUSPECT WILL BE. A TOPIC OF

00:36:48.372 --> 00:36:49.507
DISCUSSION AMONG SOME OF THE

00:36:49.574 --> 00:36:50.675
OTHER PANELS LATER TODAY AND

00:36:50.741 --> 00:36:52.143
SOMETHING FOR THE COMMITTEE TO

00:36:52.209 --> 00:36:54.579
CONSIDER MOVING FORWARD IN. THE

00:36:54.645 --> 00:36:56.781
CAN YOU CONTINUE TO TRACK. AW A

00:36:56.847 --> 00:36:59.951
FINAL KIND OF A DATA POINTED TO

00:37:00.017 --> 00:37:02.219
KEEP TO KEEP AN EYE ON TO- WITH

00:37:02.286 --> 00:37:03.087
TRACKING THE RECOVERY MOVING

00:37:03.154 --> 00:37:05.957
FORWARD IS WITH- INFLATION SO

00:37:06.023 --> 00:37:09.160
IF WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. I'M

00:37:09.226 --> 00:37:11.796
SURE YOU'VE HEARD OFTEN. ON THE

00:37:11.862 --> 00:37:13.931
NEWS OR AND MEDIA. THAT THE

00:37:13.998 --> 00:37:15.433
RECENT MONTHS I'VE SEEN A

00:37:15.499 --> 00:37:19.236
MARKET UPTAKE IN INFLATION- AND

00:37:19.303 --> 00:37:21.305
THIS IS- THIS GRAPHIC HERE

00:37:21.372 --> 00:37:23.708
SHOWING ONE. COMMON MEASURE OF

00:37:23.774 --> 00:37:25.676
THAT THAT IS PERHAPS MORE

00:37:25.743 --> 00:37:27.411
RELEVANT FOR BUSINESS IS CALLED

00:37:27.478 --> 00:37:29.213
THE PRODUCER PRICE INDEX. I

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.449
KIND OF CAPTURES THE BROADCAST

00:37:31.515 --> 00:37:33.217
OF MANY GOODS AND SERVICES AND

00:37:33.284 --> 00:37:35.086
WE SEE HERE OVER THE LAST THREE

00:37:35.152 --> 00:37:37.388
MONTHS. A SIGNIFICANT UPTICK IN

00:37:37.455 --> 00:37:38.356
KIND OF COSTS THAT YOU MIGHT

00:37:38.422 --> 00:37:41.726
EXPECT BUSINESSES TO BE FACING.

00:37:41.792 --> 00:37:43.127
AND SO IF THIS WERE TO BECOME A

00:37:43.194 --> 00:37:44.528
MORE PERMANENT PATTERN THAT

00:37:44.595 --> 00:37:45.863
WOULD YOU KNOW BE A PRETTY

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:47.431
IMPORTANT PRESSURE FOR

00:37:47.498 --> 00:37:50.601
BUSINESSES MOVING FORWARD-

00:37:50.668 --> 00:37:52.970
HOPEFULLY OF MANY MOST.

00:37:53.037 --> 00:37:54.472
ECONOMISTS AT THE MOMENT APPEAR

00:37:54.538 --> 00:37:55.539
TO THINK THAT THIS WILL BE A

00:37:55.606 --> 00:37:56.907
TEMPORARY THING MORE OF A

00:37:56.974 --> 00:38:00.211
REFLECTION OF. THE FRICTIONS

00:38:00.277 --> 00:38:01.779
INHERENT OF BRAIN KIND OF THE

00:38:01.846 --> 00:38:03.381
ECONOMY BACK ONLINE AND THAT

00:38:03.447 --> 00:38:04.649
WE'RE SEEING SUDDEN DEMAND FOR

00:38:04.715 --> 00:38:07.218
THINGS BEFORE BUYING BEFORE AND

00:38:07.284 --> 00:38:08.252
BUSINESSES ARE HAVING A HARD

00:38:08.319 --> 00:38:09.954
TIME RAMPING BACK UP TO MEET

00:38:10.021 --> 00:38:13.157
THAT- AND THAT HOPEFULLY THAT

00:38:13.224 --> 00:38:13.791
WILL KIND OF WORK ITSELF OUT IN

00:38:13.858 --> 00:38:16.060
THE COMING MONTHS- BUT-

00:38:16.127 --> 00:38:17.061
NONETHELESS THIS IS KIND OF

00:38:17.128 --> 00:38:19.497
ALSO AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR TO.

00:38:19.563 --> 00:38:21.565
TO FOLLOW ARE MOVING FORWARD

00:38:21.632 --> 00:38:24.435
TO. BET THAT COULD YOU KNOW

00:38:24.502 --> 00:38:25.036
CREATE ADDITIONAL PRESSURE FOR

00:38:25.102 --> 00:38:27.705
BUSINESSES. OF SO- THAT

00:38:27.772 --> 00:38:30.207
CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION- BUT

00:38:30.274 --> 00:38:31.842
I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

00:38:31.909 --> 00:38:32.410

I THINK WHAT WE'LL DO IS HEAR

00:38:40.284 --> 00:38:41.986
FROM ALL OF OUR PANELISTS AND

00:38:42.053 --> 00:38:44.488

BUSINESS OWNERS VERY HARD SO

00:51:58.882 --> 00:52:00.083
MARCH ELEVENTH WAS KIND OF THE

00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:01.885
KEY DATE WHEN THE WORLD HEALTH

00:52:01.952 --> 00:52:03.487
ORGANIZATION ANNOUNCED. THAT

00:52:03.553 --> 00:52:04.821
WITH THE PANDEMIC WHICH

00:52:04.888 --> 00:52:07.390
SURPRISED MANY OF US OF COURSE

00:52:07.457 --> 00:52:09.292
AND IT WAS EARLY APRIL WHERE WE

00:52:09.359 --> 00:52:09.726
REALLY SAW THE FIRST

00:52:09.793 --> 00:52:14.297
DEVASTATIONS. SO NEXT FIVE. SO

00:52:14.364 --> 00:52:17.200
THERE'S- KIND OF A SERIES OF

00:52:17.267 --> 00:52:18.902
DATA FROM THE SMALL BUSINESS

00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:20.003
ARE STARTED FROM THE BUREAU OF

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:22.339
LABOR STATISTICS SHOWING SMALL

00:52:22.405 --> 00:52:22.873
BUSINESS OWNERS AND THEIR

00:52:22.939 --> 00:52:27.477
ACTIVE. KIND OF SEE OVER THE

00:52:27.544 --> 00:52:29.079
GREAT RECESSION THERE WAS

00:52:29.145 --> 00:52:32.115
ACTUALLY ONLY A 5% DROP. IN THE

00:52:32.182 --> 00:52:32.949
NUMBER OF ACTIVE BUSINESS

00:52:33.016 --> 00:52:34.584
OWNERS AND THAT WAS OVER A YEAR

00:52:34.651 --> 00:52:36.486
AND A HALF THE GREAT RECESSION

00:52:36.553 --> 00:52:38.455
LASTED. THAT ALL THE THIRTY

00:52:38.522 --> 00:52:39.823
FEET APRIL TWENTY TWENTY AND IT

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:41.291
WAS JUST ON A SCALE BEYOND

00:52:41.358 --> 00:52:43.260
ANYTHING WE'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE

00:52:43.326 --> 00:52:46.897
SO WE LOST 22% OF ALL. BACK TO

00:52:46.963 --> 00:52:47.464
BUSINESS OWNERS IN THAT ONE

00:52:47.531 --> 00:52:49.799
MONTH. RIGHT SO MUCH LARGER

00:52:49.866 --> 00:52:51.134
THAN ANYTHING WE THOUGHT. BUT

00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:53.370
THAT NUMBER ACTUALLY. HIDES A

00:52:53.436 --> 00:52:55.338
LOT OF WHAT'S GOING ON. BENEATH

00:52:55.405 --> 00:52:56.773
IT IN TERMS OF DEMOGRAPHICS

00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:00.143
CEMEX SLIDE. SO WHAT WE SAW

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:01.511
THAT ACTUALLY GOT A LOT OF

00:53:01.578 --> 00:53:02.679
ATTENTION WITH SOME OF THE

00:53:02.746 --> 00:53:04.281
RESEARCH THAT I DID VERY EARLY

00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:06.983
ON IN THE PANDEMIC. SO SOME OF

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:08.251
THIS RESEARCH CAME OUT IN JUNE

00:53:08.318 --> 00:53:10.620
AND JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY IS

00:53:10.687 --> 00:53:11.855
THAT FOR BLACK BUSINESS OWNERS

00:53:11.922 --> 00:53:14.391
WE SAW 41% DROP IN BUSINESS

00:53:14.457 --> 00:53:18.028
ACTIVITY. THAT WAS A HUGE

00:53:18.094 --> 00:53:21.031
CONCERN RIGHT A LOT AMONG. A

00:53:21.097 --> 00:53:23.567
LOT OF- YOU KNOW THE BUSINESS

00:53:23.633 --> 00:53:25.735
COMMUNITY AND POLICYMAKERS BUT

00:53:25.802 --> 00:53:27.003
ALSO LET NEXT BUSINESSES

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:30.040
DROPPED BY OVER 30% IN ASIAN

00:53:30.106 --> 00:53:31.908
BUSINESS OWNERS DROPPED BY A

00:53:31.975 --> 00:53:33.343
HIGHER PERCENTAGE THAN THE

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:37.380
NATIONAL AVERAGE. NEXT FIVE. SO

00:53:37.447 --> 00:53:38.882
THEN WHAT HAPPENED SINCE APRIL

00:53:38.949 --> 00:53:40.216
IS REALLY IMPORTANT YOU KNOW

00:53:40.283 --> 00:53:42.452
HOW WE RECOVERED. AGAIN

00:53:42.519 --> 00:53:43.954
FOCUSING ON SMALL BUSINESS

00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:45.455
OWNERS THEMSELVES NOT SO MUCH

00:53:45.522 --> 00:53:46.590
THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE

00:53:46.656 --> 00:53:48.024
EMPLOYER BUSINESSES OR LARGER

00:53:48.091 --> 00:53:49.759
BUSINESSES THESE ARE ACTUAL

00:53:49.826 --> 00:53:51.361
INDIVIDUALS OWNING BUSINESSES.

00:53:51.428 --> 00:53:54.965
THE NEXT. FIVE I'M WHAT YOU CAN

00:53:55.031 --> 00:53:55.832
SEE IF THERE WAS A STEADY

00:53:55.899 --> 00:53:59.736
RECOVER. AFTER APRIL MAY JUNE

00:53:59.803 --> 00:54:01.271
JULY WE JUST SAW THIS KIND OF

00:54:01.338 --> 00:54:03.239
STEADY INCREASE. IN BUSINESS

00:54:03.306 --> 00:54:05.275
OWNER ACTIVITY ALL THE WAY

00:54:05.342 --> 00:54:07.477
UNTIL OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY.

00:54:07.544 --> 00:54:08.278
TEN THINGS TURNED AROUND WE

00:54:08.345 --> 00:54:10.113
THOUGHT DROPPED BY THESE

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:11.448
BUSINESS OWNERS STOPPED.

00:54:11.514 --> 00:54:13.350
RUNNING THEIR BUSINESSES AT

00:54:13.416 --> 00:54:13.917
LEAST ACTIVELY RUNNING THEIR

00:54:13.984 --> 00:54:15.852
BUSINESS. AND THAT DROP

00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:17.420
HAPPENED ALL THE WAY THROUGH

00:54:17.487 --> 00:54:19.289
THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY. AND

00:54:19.356 --> 00:54:21.391
IN THE FEBRUARY. AND THEN OF

00:54:21.458 --> 00:54:22.492
COURSE WE'VE SEEN THIS KIND OF

00:54:22.559 --> 00:54:24.861
RECOVERY SINCE VACCINATIONS

00:54:24.928 --> 00:54:25.962
HAVE BEEN ROLLED OUT OF PEOPLE

00:54:26.029 --> 00:54:27.664
BECOME MUCH MORE CONFIDENT. NOT

00:54:27.731 --> 00:54:29.299
JUST THE OWNERS BUT ALSO

00:54:29.366 --> 00:54:30.233
CUSTOMERS ARE STARTING TO COME

00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:31.935
BACK. AND WE SEE KIND OF THE

00:54:32.002 --> 00:54:37.407
STUDY AND INCREASE NEXT. FIVE

00:54:37.474 --> 00:54:38.141
WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS FOR

00:54:38.208 --> 00:54:40.744
DIFFERENT. BUSINESSES OWNED BY

00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:42.946
MINORITY GROUPS WHAT WE SEE IS

00:54:43.013 --> 00:54:44.447
ACTUALLY PRETTY SIMILAR PATTERN

00:54:44.514 --> 00:54:46.082
WE SEE THIS KIND OF INCREASE

00:54:46.149 --> 00:54:47.350
WITH A BIG DROP IN APRIL THAT I

00:54:47.417 --> 00:54:49.019
SHOWED YOU BEFORE BUT THEN AN

00:54:49.085 --> 00:54:49.886
INCREASE EVERY SINGLE MONTH

00:54:49.953 --> 00:54:51.788
SINCE THEN. BEEN A BIT OF A

00:54:51.855 --> 00:54:54.124
DOWNTURN SINCE OCTOBER TO THE

00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:56.226
END OF TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN A

00:54:56.292 --> 00:54:59.062
REBOUND. THAT HAPPENS YOU KNOW

00:54:59.129 --> 00:55:00.964
MORE RECENTLY IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:55:01.031 --> 00:55:03.667
ONE. NEXT FIVE. SO WHAT

00:55:03.733 --> 00:55:04.901
HAPPENED IN CALIFORNIA SO

00:55:04.968 --> 00:55:06.636
ACTUALLY COMPILED ALL THE DATA

00:55:06.703 --> 00:55:11.241
FOR CALIFORNIA. NEXT. FIVE AND

00:55:11.307 --> 00:55:12.275
WHAT YOU SEE IS ACTUALLY VERY

00:55:12.342 --> 00:55:14.010
SIMILAR PATTERN CALIFORNIA

00:55:14.077 --> 00:55:15.078
REALLY FALLS THE NATION AS A

00:55:15.145 --> 00:55:17.447
WHOLE THE BIG DROP IN APRIL THE

00:55:17.514 --> 00:55:18.548
DROP WAS ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT

00:55:18.615 --> 00:55:20.684
LARGER IN CALIFORNIA THE

00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:21.518
REBOUND WITH A LITTLE BIT

00:55:21.584 --> 00:55:23.720
STRONGER AND THEN OCTOBER WE

00:55:23.787 --> 00:55:26.523
SEE THAT KIND OF REVERSAL AGAIN

00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:27.057
AND THEN THE INCREASE IN

00:55:27.123 --> 00:55:31.594
FEBRUARY COMING BACK. NEXT

00:55:31.661 --> 00:55:32.462
FIVE. AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT

00:55:32.529 --> 00:55:34.097
THIS BY DIFFERENT MINORITY

00:55:34.164 --> 00:55:35.699
GROUPS SO LOOKING AT THIS FOR.

00:55:35.765 --> 00:55:37.600
BLACK BUSINESS OWNERS LACK NEXT

00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:38.501
BUSINESS OWNERS IN THE ASIAN

00:55:38.568 --> 00:55:40.103
BUSINESS OWNERS. YOU SEE

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:42.005
SOMEONE OF SIMILAR TRENDS THE

00:55:42.072 --> 00:55:43.740
PROBLEM HERE IS THAT. YOU KNOW

00:55:43.807 --> 00:55:44.641
THE DATA BECOME A LITTLE MORE

00:55:44.708 --> 00:55:46.943
IMPRECISE- BUT THE GENERAL

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:49.879
PATTERN IS STILL SOMEWHAT THEIR

00:55:49.946 --> 00:55:50.480
FIRST SPECIALLY FABRICATE THIS

00:55:50.547 --> 00:55:52.248
UP. SO LET'S MOVE TO THE NEXT

00:55:52.315 --> 00:55:55.385
SLIDE. SO ONE OF THE ISSUES

00:55:55.452 --> 00:55:56.986
THERE IS THAT IT'S NOT JUST

00:55:57.053 --> 00:55:59.089
THAT WE HAVE THIS RECOVERY ARE

00:55:59.155 --> 00:56:01.491
HAVING THIS RECOVERY. BUT THOSE

00:56:01.558 --> 00:56:04.794
ARE MANY MONTHS OF LOST SALES.

00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:05.995
AND THAT'S GOING TO HAVE A BIG

00:56:06.062 --> 00:56:08.098
IMPACT ON THE INCOMES OF THESE

00:56:08.164 --> 00:56:10.100
BUSINESS OWNERS AND THAT'S

00:56:10.166 --> 00:56:11.067
ACTUALLY BEEN MUCH HARDER TO

00:56:11.134 --> 00:56:12.969
STUDY. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS

00:56:13.036 --> 00:56:14.037
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO WORK ON

00:56:14.104 --> 00:56:15.805
MORE RECENTLY IS LOOK AT SALES

00:56:15.872 --> 00:56:17.273
LOSSES SPECIFICALLY IN

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:18.541
CALIFORNIA AND I'VE BEEN

00:56:18.608 --> 00:56:20.043
WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:21.277
DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE

00:56:21.344 --> 00:56:23.880
ADMINISTRATION. TO EXAMINE THAT

00:56:23.947 --> 00:56:25.615
EXACT QUESTION TO TRY TO GET

00:56:25.682 --> 00:56:27.484
THIS ISSUE OF. IF THESE

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:29.285
BUSINESS OWNERS WERE INACTIVE

00:56:29.352 --> 00:56:31.020
IN APRIL MAY YOU KNOW MANY OF

00:56:31.087 --> 00:56:32.689
THEM IN JUNE THEN WE HAVE THAT

00:56:32.756 --> 00:56:34.624
KIND OF DROPPED AGAIN. IN

00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:37.527
OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER HOW

00:56:37.594 --> 00:56:39.963
MUCH WAS LOST. IN TOTAL OVER

00:56:40.029 --> 00:56:44.167
THIS ENTIRE YEAR NEXT FIVE.

00:56:44.234 --> 00:56:45.869
FOUR THIRTY THIS AND USING THE

00:56:45.935 --> 00:56:48.037
DATA FROM THE CD TFA AND YOU

00:56:48.104 --> 00:56:50.473
CAN SEE THE HUGE DROP IN THE

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:52.575
SECOND QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY

00:56:52.642 --> 00:56:53.543
SO THE STATE OUR QUARTERLY NOT

00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:56.179
MONTHLY IT WAS A 15% DROP IN

00:56:56.246 --> 00:56:58.047
TOTAL SALES AMONG ALL

00:56:58.114 --> 00:57:00.350
CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES. THEN YOU

00:57:00.416 --> 00:57:01.718
CAN SEE IN THE QUARTER THREE

00:57:01.785 --> 00:57:02.886
THERE WAS A BIT OF A RECOVERY

00:57:02.952 --> 00:57:04.254
BUT IT'S STILL MUCH LOWER THAN

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.656
OUR NORMAL WHICH IS YOU KNOW

00:57:06.723 --> 00:57:08.725
325% GROWTH EACH QUARTER WHEN

00:57:08.792 --> 00:57:10.160
YOU LOOK AT YEAR OVER YEAR.

00:57:10.226 --> 00:57:12.128
RIGHT SO THIS IS ALL ADDRESSING

00:57:12.195 --> 00:57:14.063
SORT OF SEASONALITY ISSUES. BUT

00:57:14.130 --> 00:57:15.598
THEN YOU CAN SEE THAT QUARTER

00:57:15.665 --> 00:57:16.800
FOR DIDN'T LOOK SO GOOD FOR AYE

00:57:16.866 --> 00:57:19.536
WE DROPPED AGAIN- AND OF COURSE

00:57:19.602 --> 00:57:21.404
THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE QUARTER

00:57:21.471 --> 00:57:22.639
ONE DATE IS NOT IT YES.

00:57:22.705 --> 00:57:24.040
AVAILABLE BUT IT WILL SOON BE

00:57:24.107 --> 00:57:27.777
AVAILABLE FOR ALL. NEXT FIVE.

00:57:27.844 --> 00:57:29.813
HOW DOES THE FLIP BY SECTOR. OF

00:57:29.879 --> 00:57:31.014
COURSE AS BRIAN WAS SHOWING

00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:33.950
EARLIER ACCOMMODATIONS JUST GOT

00:57:34.017 --> 00:57:36.686
HIT EXTREMELY HARD. QUARTER TO

00:57:36.753 --> 00:57:40.023
WE SAW A 90% DROP IN SALES.

00:57:40.089 --> 00:57:41.024
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE

00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:42.225
NEVER SEEN BEFORE THERE'S

00:57:42.292 --> 00:57:44.194
NOTHING EVEN CLOSE TO IT AND

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:45.161
YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THE DATA

00:57:45.228 --> 00:57:47.430
GOING FOR. BACK A LONG TIME YOU

00:57:47.497 --> 00:57:49.599
CAN SEE RESTAURANTS WERE ALSO

00:57:49.666 --> 00:57:51.768
HIT EXTREMELY HARD. AND THAT

00:57:51.835 --> 00:57:53.069
DOES INCLUDE ALL THE YOU KNOW I

00:57:53.136 --> 00:57:53.970
MEAN THAT INCLUDES ALL THE TAKE

00:57:54.037 --> 00:57:56.039
OUT RESTAURANTS THAT THE KIND

00:57:56.105 --> 00:57:57.540
OF CHAIN RESTAURANTS THAT WERE

00:57:57.607 --> 00:57:58.308
SORT OF HAD THEIR DRIVE THRU IS

00:57:58.374 --> 00:58:00.343
OPEN. AND AT LEAST SOME TAKE

00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:02.145
OUT SERVICE RUNNING BUT STILL

00:58:02.212 --> 00:58:04.714
WE SEE HUGE DROPS FOR THOSE TWO

00:58:04.781 --> 00:58:06.950
SECTORS. IMAGE SHOWS YOU THAT

00:58:07.016 --> 00:58:08.384
IT WASN'T JUST A QUARTER TO A

00:58:08.451 --> 00:58:10.286
QUARTER THREE AND QUARTER FOUR

00:58:10.353 --> 00:58:12.689
ARE STILL LAGGING. OFFER TWENTY

00:58:12.755 --> 00:58:13.356
TWENTY AND THAT'S THAT'S

00:58:13.423 --> 00:58:14.257
SHOWING YOU JUST KIND OF THE

00:58:14.324 --> 00:58:16.759
DEVASTATION OF THESE BUSINESSES

00:58:16.826 --> 00:58:20.263
ARE BEING HIT HARD. NEXT SLIDE.

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:22.465
HOW DOES THIS LOOK BY SECTOR IS

00:58:22.532 --> 00:58:24.100
IT TRUE FOR ALL SECTORS THERE A

00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:25.535
LOT OF FACTORS THAT WERE HIT

00:58:25.602 --> 00:58:27.303
HARD I HAVE. YOU KNOW A NUMBER

00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:29.439
OF THEM LISTED HERE. BUT NOT

00:58:29.505 --> 00:58:31.274
FOR EVERYONE RIGHT WHAT YOU SEE

00:58:31.341 --> 00:58:33.076
IS THAT HARDWARE STORES.

00:58:33.142 --> 00:58:35.678
GROCERY STORES. ENOUGH ONE TO

00:58:35.745 --> 00:58:37.547
THE FAR RIGHT THAT THING GRAY

00:58:37.614 --> 00:58:39.549
THERE ARE NON STORE RETAILERS.

00:58:39.616 --> 00:58:41.651
AND SO THOSE ARE ONLINE SALES.

00:58:41.718 --> 00:58:44.754
WENT WAY UP. DURING THE

00:58:44.821 --> 00:58:47.257
PANDEMIC NEXT FIVE. IF YOU

00:58:47.323 --> 00:58:48.958
FOCUS ON THE DIFFERENT QUARTERS

00:58:49.025 --> 00:58:51.160
YOU KNOW QUARTER TO WE THOUGHT

00:58:51.227 --> 00:58:54.197
HUGE JUMP OVER 180% QUARTER

00:58:54.264 --> 00:58:55.465
THREE THERE WAS A BIG INCREASE

00:58:55.531 --> 00:58:56.332
QUARTER FOR THERE WAS A BIG

00:58:56.399 --> 00:58:58.334
INCREASE SO IT WASN'T JUST A

00:58:58.401 --> 00:59:00.536
SHORT TERM A FACT NOT PART OF

00:59:00.603 --> 00:59:01.971
THIS WAS BECAUSE THE CHANGES IN

00:59:02.038 --> 00:59:03.573
THE WAY SALES TAXES ARE

00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:06.776
pCOLLECTED. FOR ONLINE RETAIL. A

00:59:06.843 --> 00:59:08.278
LOT OF THIS IS REAL A LOT OF

00:59:08.344 --> 00:59:10.780
THIS IS JUST SHIFTED FROM SMALL

00:59:10.847 --> 00:59:12.882
BUSINESSES FROM STOREFRONTS. TO

00:59:12.949 --> 00:59:18.221
ONLINE SALES. NEXT. FIVE NOW

00:59:18.288 --> 00:59:19.022
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO TO MOVE

00:59:19.088 --> 00:59:21.190
FORWARD YOU KNOW ONE OF THE KEY

00:59:21.257 --> 00:59:22.525
THINGS THAT THAT BIANCA MENTION

00:59:22.592 --> 00:59:24.060
WAS ACCESS TO FINANCIAL

00:59:24.127 --> 00:59:25.995
CAPITAL. IT'S ONE OF THE MOST

00:59:26.062 --> 00:59:28.097
IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS THAT

00:59:28.164 --> 00:59:30.066
ESPECIALLY MINORITY BUSINESSES

00:59:30.133 --> 00:59:32.402
FACE IF YOU JUST LOOK AT ONE

00:59:32.468 --> 00:59:35.104
NUMBER TWO NUMBERS HERE- THE

00:59:35.171 --> 00:59:36.372
MEDIAN NET WORTH OF BLACK

00:59:36.439 --> 00:59:39.375
FAMILIES IN THE U. S. IS NINE

00:59:39.442 --> 00:59:39.943
THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY

00:59:40.009 --> 00:59:41.010
SEVEN DOLLARS THAT MEANS 50% OF

00:59:41.077 --> 00:59:43.513
BLACK FAMILIES HAVE LESS. THAN

00:59:43.579 --> 00:59:45.415
TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN NETWORK

00:59:45.481 --> 00:59:46.282
THAT ADDING UP ALL THE HOUSING

00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:48.952
EQUITY. THE VALUE ON THEIR

00:59:49.018 --> 00:59:51.788
STOCKS ARE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS.

00:59:51.854 --> 00:59:52.789
ADDING UP THE VALUE OF THEIR

00:59:52.855 --> 00:59:55.558
CAR IT'S LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND

00:59:55.625 --> 00:59:58.594
FOR LATIN NEXT IT'S TWENTY FIVE

00:59:58.661 --> 00:59:59.329
THOUSAND. NOW WHEN YOU SWITCH

00:59:59.395 --> 01:00:01.197
OVER TO LOOK AT WHITE FAMILIES

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:03.833
THAT NUMBER JUMPS ALL THE WAY

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:04.400
TO HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND

01:00:04.467 --> 01:00:05.601
DOLLARS. SO WEALTH INEQUALITIES

01:00:05.668 --> 01:00:07.637
ON A SCALE THAT'S WAY BEYOND

01:00:07.704 --> 01:00:10.106
ANYTHING WE SEE FOR INCOME. OR

01:00:10.173 --> 01:00:12.041
ANY OTHER MEASURE THAT WE HAVE

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:14.277
ECONOMICALLY. SO THAT JUST

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:16.512
CREATES A HUGE CONSTRAINTS IN

01:00:16.579 --> 01:00:17.347
TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO ACCESS

01:00:17.413 --> 01:00:20.483
CAPITAL SO THAT THAT'S CLEARLY

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:21.017
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:00:21.084 --> 01:00:22.452
CONSTRAINTS IT'S BEEN ONE. FOR

01:00:22.518 --> 01:00:23.820
MANY YEARS AND IT'S GOING TO BE

01:00:23.886 --> 01:00:24.821
EVEN MORE IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW

01:00:24.887 --> 01:00:25.822
IS THEY SHOWED YOU THOSE BIG

01:00:25.888 --> 01:00:27.890
LOSSES IN SALES AND BUSINESS

01:00:27.957 --> 01:00:29.792
ACTIVITIES OVER TIME. THE OTHER

01:00:29.859 --> 01:00:30.560
ONE NO I THINK THAT'S REALLY

01:00:30.626 --> 01:00:32.462
IMPORTANT HERE. IS WE'VE REALLY

01:00:32.528 --> 01:00:34.197
SEEN AN EXTENSIVE SHIFT TO

01:00:34.263 --> 01:00:35.498
ONLINE SHOPPING THERE'S NO

01:00:35.565 --> 01:00:37.867
DOUBT RIGHT WE'VE SEEN IT FOR

01:00:37.934 --> 01:00:40.269
ALL GROUPS OF THE POPULATION

01:00:40.336 --> 01:00:41.471
FOR ALL TYPES OF CUSTOMERS.

01:00:41.537 --> 01:00:43.239
PREVIOUSLY ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:45.241
WERE RELUCTANT TO GO ONLINE TO

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:46.676
SHOP AND NOW THEY'RE NOT RIGHT

01:00:46.743 --> 01:00:48.077
THERE USING INSTACART THEY'RE

01:00:48.144 --> 01:00:50.613
USING AMAZON THEY'RE USING. YOU

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.114
KNOW SAFE WAYS DELIVERY

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:53.282
SERVICES. AND SO THAT'S

01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:54.183
SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAPPEN

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:55.818
PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC BUT WAS

01:00:55.885 --> 01:00:57.720
GREATLY ACCELERATED DURING THE

01:00:57.787 --> 01:00:59.655
PANDEMIC. AND SO THAT'S GOING

01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:01.591
TO BE A IMPORTANT ONE IS THAT

01:01:01.657 --> 01:01:03.993
WE NEED TO. GET CUSTOMERS TO GO

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:07.397
BACK SHOP LOCAL- YOU KNOW TO

01:01:07.463 --> 01:01:08.698
KIND OF OFFSET THAT A LITTLE

01:01:08.765 --> 01:01:10.299
BIT. BUT I THINK SIMILARLY

01:01:10.366 --> 01:01:12.001
WE'RE NEVER GOING TO GO AWAY

01:01:12.068 --> 01:01:13.903
FROM THAT I THINK CUSTOMERS NOW

01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:15.371
LIKE THE CONVENIENCE OF

01:01:15.438 --> 01:01:17.006
SHOPPING ONLINE. AND THAT'S

01:01:17.073 --> 01:01:18.074
ALWAYS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR SMALL

01:01:18.141 --> 01:01:19.776
BUSINESSES IT'S HARD FOR THEM

01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:21.944
TO KEEP THEIR INVENTORY IT'S

01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:22.979
HARD FOR THEM TO SET UP WEB

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:25.348
PAGES. THAT ARE. BETTER YOU

01:01:25.415 --> 01:01:26.849
KNOW FAST MOVING THAT CHANGE

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:28.918
THAT UPDATE QUICKLY. THAT ARE

01:01:28.985 --> 01:01:31.120
REALLY USER FRIENDLY. WORDS BIG

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:33.656
BOX STORES. ONLINE RETAILERS

01:01:33.723 --> 01:01:36.225
HAVE THAT SET UP AND IT'S MUCH

01:01:36.292 --> 01:01:37.527
EASIER FOR THEM TO DO THAT.

01:01:37.593 --> 01:01:38.661
ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I SEE A

01:01:38.728 --> 01:01:40.596
SEARCH ENGINES OFTEN PRIORITIZE

01:01:40.663 --> 01:01:42.298
SOME LARGE BUSINESSES RIGHT

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:44.033
BECAUSE THEY'RE PAYING. THE

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.302
ADS. BUT THEY COULD PRIORITIZE

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:48.404
LOCAL BUSINESSES THEY COULD GO

01:01:48.471 --> 01:01:49.939
AND SAY LOOK YOU'RE THE LOCAL

01:01:50.006 --> 01:01:51.441
SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WILL SELL

01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:52.341
THIS EXACT PRODUCT YOU'RE

01:01:52.408 --> 01:01:54.010
LOOKING FOR. YOU SEARCH FOR

01:01:54.077 --> 01:01:55.678
LEVI'S JEANS IT COULD SHOW YOU

01:01:55.745 --> 01:01:57.380
THE LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES THAT

01:01:57.447 --> 01:01:59.248
HAVE THAT. THING THAT YOU WANT

01:01:59.315 --> 01:02:01.017
THAT PRODUCT THAT YOU WANT.

01:02:01.084 --> 01:02:02.585
INSTEAD OF FOCUSING SO MUCH ON

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:04.287
ONLINE RETAILERS I THINK THAT

01:02:04.353 --> 01:02:05.188
COULD BE A YOU KNOW AN

01:02:05.254 --> 01:02:06.355
IMPORTANT WAY WE COULD START TO

01:02:06.422 --> 01:02:07.924
TURN THIS AROUND. FOR SMALL

01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:09.826
BUSINESSES ESPECIALLY SMALL

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:11.327
BUSINESSES OWNED BY PEOPLE OF

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:14.864
COLOR IN. AND IN DIFFERENT

01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:17.667
COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU. THANK

01:02:17.733 --> 01:02:20.069
YOU DR FARLEY. AB SO I'VE GOT A

01:02:20.136 --> 01:02:21.838
COUPLE QUESTIONS AND THEN. LEFT

01:02:21.904 --> 01:02:23.840
IT OPEN UP THANK YOU MISS CREA

01:02:23.906 --> 01:02:25.007
FOR RAP FOR BEING HERE AND FOR

01:02:25.074 --> 01:02:25.975
BEING PART OF THIS COMMITTEE

01:02:26.042 --> 01:02:27.110
REALLY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR

01:02:27.176 --> 01:02:28.611
PARTNERSHIP AND LEADERSHIP ON

01:02:28.678 --> 01:02:30.413
THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. TO JUST TO

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:34.884
START. I REALIZE THAT THIS AT

01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:36.085
THIS ECONOMIC THE ECONOMIC

01:02:36.152 --> 01:02:37.653
SHOCK THAT WE SIDE THROUGHOUT

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:38.821
THE CABIN NINETEEN CRISIS

01:02:38.888 --> 01:02:39.555
REALLY IS KIND OF UNLIKE

01:02:39.622 --> 01:02:42.158
ANYTHING WE'VE EVER SEEN AND IT

01:02:42.225 --> 01:02:44.494
SEEMS SIMILARLY THE RECOVERY IS

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.796
DIFFERENT THAN. RECOVERY THAT

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:49.198
WE'VE EVER SEEN I'M BUT ARE

01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:52.201
THERE LESSONS THAT WE THAT WE

01:02:52.268 --> 01:02:56.239
THAT WE LEARNED IN THE- PAST

01:02:56.305 --> 01:02:58.174
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT PERIOD THAT-

01:02:58.241 --> 01:02:59.575
WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF

01:02:59.642 --> 01:03:01.077
PARTICULARLY AS THEY RELATE TO

01:03:01.144 --> 01:03:03.179
SMALL BUSINESS AND AS WE THINK

01:03:03.246 --> 01:03:05.281
ABOUT- HOW DO WE- AT HOW DO WE

01:03:05.348 --> 01:03:07.283
OPTIMALLY NAVIGATE THAT THE

01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:09.018
COMING MONTHS FOR. CALIFORNIA

01:03:09.085 --> 01:03:12.355
SMALL BUSINESS. I THAT THAT'S A

01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:13.990
QUESTION FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS

01:03:14.056 --> 01:03:17.160
TO WANTS TO JUMP IN. I MEAN I

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:19.529
CAN JUMP YEAH YOU KNOW BECAUSE

01:03:19.595 --> 01:03:20.129
I STUDIED THE GREAT RECESSION

01:03:20.196 --> 01:03:22.098
PRETTY CAREFULLY. THEY'RE WHAT

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:24.167
WE SAW WAS A PRETTY CONTINUE

01:03:24.233 --> 01:03:25.635
RECOVERY RIGHT AND THAT THEY

01:03:25.701 --> 01:03:27.503
SHOWED YOU HERE. WE'VE GOT A

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:29.672
LOT OF SPUTTERING. YES YOU KNOW

01:03:29.739 --> 01:03:31.274
KIND OF STARTING AND STOPPING

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:32.308
AND STARTING AGAIN AND

01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:33.843
STOPPING. AND THAT'S BEEN

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:34.877
REALLY DIFFICULT FOR SMALL

01:03:34.944 --> 01:03:36.445
BUSINESSES AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN

01:03:36.512 --> 01:03:38.681
THAT BEFORE. IN THE PREVIOUS

01:03:38.748 --> 01:03:40.316
RECOVERY YOU KNOW ONE OF THE

01:03:40.383 --> 01:03:41.417
THINGS THAT WAS A REAL PROBLEM

01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:43.386
IS ACCESS TO CAPITAL RIGHT IS

01:03:43.452 --> 01:03:45.388
TO BE ABLE TO. TO AS BIANCA WAS

01:03:45.454 --> 01:03:47.256
MENTIONING EARLIER ABOUT PAYING

01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:49.659
RENT WITH A HUGE PROBLEM RIGHT

01:03:49.725 --> 01:03:51.093
IS. IF YOU'VE GOT A BIG

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.229
DECREASING PASTERN BAND HOW DO

01:03:53.296 --> 01:03:54.664
YOU PAY THE RENT THAT YOU'RE

01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:56.432
YOU'RE YOU KNOW IF YOU- EVERY

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:58.534
SINGLE MONTH. AND ALSO THE

01:03:58.601 --> 01:04:01.904
SALARIES FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES.

01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:03.039
THAT'S DIFFICULT AND RECESSION.

01:04:03.105 --> 01:04:04.874
IT'S NOT CLEAR YOU KNOW RIGHT

01:04:04.941 --> 01:04:05.841
NOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IT'S

01:04:05.908 --> 01:04:07.476
YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO GET LABOR

01:04:07.543 --> 01:04:08.010
THAT WAS ALSO BROUGHT UP

01:04:08.077 --> 01:04:10.446
EARLIER- THERE DOES SEEM TO BE

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:12.215
A LOT OF PENT UP CONSUMER

01:04:12.281 --> 01:04:12.915
DEMAND THAT WILL BE VERY

01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:15.718
DIFFERENT- BUT I DO THINK LIKE

01:04:15.785 --> 01:04:17.086
ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND BEING

01:04:17.153 --> 01:04:18.187
ABLE TO PAY RENT IS GONNA BE

01:04:18.254 --> 01:04:19.455
SOMETHING WE DEFINITELY LEARNED

01:04:19.522 --> 01:04:20.756
FROM THE PREVIOUS RECESSION THE

01:04:20.823 --> 01:04:22.792
FACT THAT. AN IMPORTANT ISSUE

01:04:22.858 --> 01:04:24.393
THAT WE NEED TO DEAL WITH. AND

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:25.895
IT IS I ACTUALLY LET I WANT TO

01:04:25.962 --> 01:04:26.762
DIG INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT

01:04:26.829 --> 01:04:28.464
BECAUSE I KNOW. I'M A DOCTOR

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:30.600
FAIRLY AND ALSO A MUSLIM QUEST.

01:04:30.666 --> 01:04:33.135
HIGHLIGHTED THAT. AS AS AS A-

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:35.104
KEY CHALLENGE AGAIN. ONE THAT

01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:36.339
CERTAINLY PRECEDED THE PANDEMIC

01:04:36.405 --> 01:04:37.473
BUT AS HAS I THINK BEEN

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:38.407
HIGHLIGHTED AND GAS.

01:04:38.474 --> 01:04:41.978
EXACERBATED BY IT- ARE THERE

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:44.013
SEND. PROGRAM THE OTHER

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.815
PROGRAMS THAT YOU CAN POINT TO

01:04:45.881 --> 01:04:47.283
EITHER HEARING CALIFORNIA AT

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:49.619
REGIONALLY. OR ELSEWHERE IN THE

01:04:49.685 --> 01:04:52.054
STATES- THAT. WE ARE A GOOD

01:04:52.121 --> 01:04:53.956
MODEL. FOR US AS WE THINK

01:04:54.023 --> 01:04:56.325
ABOUT. CONNECTING UP MORE

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:58.694
ENTREPRENEURS PARTICULARLY. AT

01:04:58.761 --> 01:04:59.462
WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED

01:04:59.528 --> 01:05:02.832
BUSINESSES WITH. CAPITAL THAT

01:05:02.898 --> 01:05:04.166
SO DESPERATELY NEEDED. I MEAN

01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:05.067
ONE OF THE ONES THAT I'VE BEEN

01:05:05.134 --> 01:05:06.636
TRYING TO DO SOME RESEARCH ON

01:05:06.702 --> 01:05:08.337
IF THE PPP PROGRAMME IN THE

01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:10.306
IDOL PROGRAM WHICH WERE ALSO

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:12.008
AGREED PREVIOUSLY YOU KNOW.

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:15.211
DISCUSSED AND- PRESENTATIONS.

01:05:15.278 --> 01:05:16.812
THOSE PROGRAMS PROVIDED AID

01:05:16.879 --> 01:05:19.215
RIGHT TO BUSINESSES TO KIND OF

01:05:19.282 --> 01:05:20.149
KEEP THEM AFLOAT TO KEEP

01:05:20.216 --> 01:05:21.851
EMPLOYEES YOU KNOW HIRED AT

01:05:21.917 --> 01:05:23.352
THOSE BUSINESSES WE'RE STILL

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:24.320
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY

01:05:24.387 --> 01:05:26.155
DID. THERE WAS A LOT OF CONCERN

01:05:26.222 --> 01:05:27.290
THAT THEY WERE NOT.

01:05:27.356 --> 01:05:29.225
PROPORTIONALLY GIVEN OUT TO

01:05:29.292 --> 01:05:31.260
MINORITY COMMUNITIES. AND SOME

01:05:31.327 --> 01:05:33.929
OF THE RESEARCH THAT I'M

01:05:33.996 --> 01:05:34.463
FINDING NOW IS THAT IT IS

01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:35.765
ACTUALLY. THAT'S TRUE IN THE

01:05:35.831 --> 01:05:37.867
EARLY PART BUT IT REVERSED

01:05:37.933 --> 01:05:39.402
LATER ESPECIALLY IN THE LATEST

01:05:39.468 --> 01:05:41.170
ROUND OF THE PPP PROGRAM WE'RE

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:41.804
ACTUALLY FINDING SOME EVIDENCE

01:05:41.871 --> 01:05:43.606
THAT IT WAS. YOU KNOW WENT THE

01:05:43.673 --> 01:05:44.707
OTHER WAY WHICH IS REALLY

01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:46.108
HELPFUL RIGHT THAT A LOT OF

01:05:46.175 --> 01:05:48.044
THESE BUSINESSES THAT WERE MOST

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:49.712
IN NEED WE'RE GETTING A- AND SO

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:51.447
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD MODEL- I

01:05:51.514 --> 01:05:53.916
THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF PUSH.

01:05:53.983 --> 01:05:55.918
TO GET THAT MONEY THROUGH LOCAL

01:05:55.985 --> 01:05:59.221
BANKS COMMUNITY BANKS HE DEFIES.

01:05:59.288 --> 01:06:01.057
AND THAT REALLY HELPED AND ALSO

01:06:01.123 --> 01:06:03.159
FINTECH WITH ANOTHER IMPORTANT

01:06:03.225 --> 01:06:04.894
ONE RIGHT IS NOT JUST GOING TO

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:06.662
THE BIG BANKS WE HAVE THESE

01:06:06.729 --> 01:06:08.531
ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH

01:06:08.597 --> 01:06:09.432
KIND OF LARGER SMALL

01:06:09.498 --> 01:06:11.901
BUSINESSES- IT OBVIOUSLY THERE

01:06:11.967 --> 01:06:14.603
IS A LOT OF BAD PRESS WHEN THE

01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:16.439
LAKERS RECEIVED ALONE. DALY

01:06:16.505 --> 01:06:18.107
SANDWICH WITH ANOTHER ONE RIGHT

01:06:18.174 --> 01:06:19.342
THERE WERE A FEW OF THESE YOU

01:06:19.408 --> 01:06:21.577
KNOW CLEARLY BIG BUSINESSES

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:22.545
THAT WE'RE GETTING THESE LONG.

01:06:22.611 --> 01:06:23.913
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S REALLY

01:06:23.979 --> 01:06:25.081
KIND OF TURNED AROUND AND SO I

01:06:25.147 --> 01:06:27.383
THINK THAT THAT'S BEEN-

01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:28.884
HOPEFULLY SUCCESSFUL AT THE

01:06:28.951 --> 01:06:30.286
GANDHI I'M DOING RESEARCH ON IT

01:06:30.353 --> 01:06:32.188
RIGHT NOW SO WE DON'T KNOW THE

01:06:32.254 --> 01:06:32.955
REAL ANSWER TO WHETHER OR NOT

01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:34.890
IT WORKED. AND THAT'S A TOUGH

01:06:34.957 --> 01:06:36.859
QUESTION ANYWAY HEY. WHAT IS IT

01:06:36.926 --> 01:06:38.227
MEAN TO WORK RIGHT WE HOPE THAT

01:06:38.294 --> 01:06:39.228
IT SAVED A LOT OF JOBS AND

01:06:39.295 --> 01:06:41.764
HOPE. WE HOPE THAT IT KEPT

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:43.566
THESE BUSINESSES. ARE RUNNING.

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:45.401
WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE. BUT

01:06:45.468 --> 01:06:46.235
SAID IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU'RE

01:06:46.302 --> 01:06:49.138
SAYING IS THAT THE TAKE AWAY

01:06:49.205 --> 01:06:53.776
FOR US AS POLICY MAKERS MOVING-FORWARD IS. THAT THE MORE THAT

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:57.246
WE ACTIVELY LOOK TO HAVE.

01:06:57.313 --> 01:06:58.047
COUPLE NOT NOT JUST SAY HEY

01:06:58.114 --> 01:06:59.548
WE'RE TRYING TO GET. CAPITAL

01:06:59.615 --> 01:07:00.583
INTO THE HANDS OF UNDERSERVED

01:07:00.649 --> 01:07:02.351
BUSINESSES THAT THE MORE WE

01:07:02.418 --> 01:07:05.187
ENSURE THAT THE INTERMEDIARY IS

01:07:05.254 --> 01:07:06.989
A TRUSTED LOCAL COMMUNITY

01:07:07.056 --> 01:07:10.726
RESOURCE. THE MORE EFFECTIVELY

01:07:10.793 --> 01:07:11.293
WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:12.194
THAT AND- OBVIOUSLY IT MEANS

01:07:12.261 --> 01:07:14.029
WORKING WITH MORE PARTNERS. IT

01:07:14.096 --> 01:07:14.797
MEANS A PROGRAM THAT'S MORE

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:15.998
COMPLICATED BILL TIMIDLY A

01:07:16.065 --> 01:07:18.000
PROGRAM THAT'S MUCH MORE LIKELY

01:07:18.067 --> 01:07:19.001
TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND AN

01:07:19.068 --> 01:07:19.902
ACHIEVER AMBITION AND I THINK

01:07:19.969 --> 01:07:21.170
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT AND I

01:07:21.237 --> 01:07:22.538
THINK THAT. PART OF THE PROBLEM

01:07:22.605 --> 01:07:24.306
WITH THAT CONGRESS. HAD TO

01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:26.475
BRUSH THE FIRSTRAND PPP

01:07:26.542 --> 01:07:28.344
PROGRAMME OUT REALLY FAST. AND

01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:29.912
WHAT'S THE FASTEST WAY TO DO IT

WE TRULY REALLY SEEN. A THE

01:11:20.442 --> 01:11:21.543
IMPACT ADDITIONALLY I WOULD

01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:23.278
JUST ADD ONE MORE THING WE'VE

01:11:23.345 --> 01:11:25.981
DONE A LOT OF WORK FOR- RENT

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:26.949

DONE TOWARDS COMMERCIAL

01:11:29.918 --> 01:11:31.687
PROPERTIES I HAD A BILL TWO

01:11:31.754 --> 01:11:33.055
YEARS AGO THAT YOU KNOW WHEN I

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:34.657

01:11:34.723 --> 01:11:35.658

MARK LIKE WAS I TALKING ABOUT.

01:11:37.393 --> 01:11:39.028
BUT I'M SEEN GENTRIFICATION IN

01:11:39.094 --> 01:11:40.963
MY COMMUNITY EVERY DAY. AND SO

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:42.765
WHEN A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER MOM

01:11:42.831 --> 01:11:45.067
AND POP SHOP HAVE PAID THE

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:47.036
STANDARD FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:11:47.102 --> 01:11:49.905
A MONTH AND THERE'S NO. CAP AS

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:54.009
TO HOW OFTEN AND WHEN. THEY GET

01:11:54.076 --> 01:11:54.576
THEIR RENT INCREASED SO ONE

01:11:54.643 --> 01:11:55.277
MONTH IS FIVE TO. THE NEXT

01:11:55.344 --> 01:11:57.279
MONTH IS TEN THOUSAND THREE

01:11:57.346 --> 01:11:57.813
MONTHS FROM NOW IT'S AN

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:58.981
ADDITIONAL TEN THOUSAND. THEIR

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:02.051
RENT JUST ONE. SUPER HIGH AND

01:12:02.117 --> 01:12:03.318
THEIR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO

01:12:03.385 --> 01:12:05.054
MAKE THEIR RENT PAY THEIR

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.155
EMPLOYEES AND STILL MAKE A

01:12:06.221 --> 01:12:08.657
PROFIT IS. INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT

01:12:08.724 --> 01:12:10.659
NO ONE SANE- THAT THE LANDLORD

01:12:10.726 --> 01:12:12.227
SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO RACE

01:12:12.294 --> 01:12:14.196
RENTS ACCORDINGLY. BUT THERE

01:12:14.263 --> 01:12:15.097
SHOULD BE SOME KIND OF TENANT

01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:16.899
PROTECTION FOR SMALL BUSINESSES

01:12:16.965 --> 01:12:19.001
AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES. THAT

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:20.135
CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE ONE SO

01:12:20.202 --> 01:12:22.104
THAT THE IDENTITY OF

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:23.772
NEIGHBORHOODS REMAINS INTACT SO

01:12:23.839 --> 01:12:25.107
PEOPLE DON'T GO OUT OF BUSINESS

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:26.241
SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

01:12:26.308 --> 01:12:27.876
AFFORD THE RENT. SO THAT LOCAL

01:12:27.943 --> 01:12:29.445
COMMUNITY CAN STILL BE ABLE TO

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:31.046
BE EMPLOYED. THESE ARE ALL

01:12:31.113 --> 01:12:33.816
THINGS THAT. GIVEN COVE IT WE

01:12:33.882 --> 01:12:34.750
ALL NOW HAVE TO REALLY THINK

01:12:34.817 --> 01:12:36.985
ABOUT IN TERMS OF WHAT. WHAT

01:12:37.052 --> 01:12:39.054
DOES IT REALLY LOOK LIKE. TO

01:12:39.121 --> 01:12:41.523
REOPEN SAFELY AND TO PROVIDE-

01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:42.958
THE RESOURCES AND TOOLS THAT

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:44.593
SMALL BUSINESSES NEED TO BE

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:46.795
ABLE TO SUCCEED SO THANK YOU

YOU FOR THAT AND I THINK THAT.

01:12:50.566 --> 01:12:51.333
FOR ME I THINK IT JUST DRIVES

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.869
HOME. THE FACT THAT WHEN WE

01:12:53.936 --> 01:12:54.937
TALK ABOUT A SMALL BUSINESS

01:12:55.003 --> 01:12:57.473
FAILING. IT'S NOT JUST ONE

01:12:57.539 --> 01:13:00.509
PERSON'S DREAM. THAT DIES IT'S

01:13:00.576 --> 01:13:01.076
NOT JUST ONE PERSON'S

01:13:01.143 --> 01:13:04.113
LIVELIHOOD. IT REALLY IS IT'S

01:13:04.179 --> 01:13:05.314

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:10.419
IS. SOMETIMES A HUB OF THE

01:13:10.486 --> 01:13:11.620
COMMUNITY IT REALLY IS KIND OF

01:13:11.687 --> 01:13:13.155
THIS WHOLE ECOSYSTEM THAT'S

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:15.157
THAT'S HANGING IN THE BALANCE

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:17.025
WHICH IS WHY I THINK. IT'S JUST

01:13:17.092 --> 01:13:18.861
SUCH A CRITICAL THE CRITICAL

01:13:18.927 --> 01:13:21.196

01:13:22.631 --> 01:13:23.766
THAT CREATES ECONOMIC

01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:25.367
OPPORTUNITY AFTER MILLIONS OF

VISITING PARTY PAL. WHICH IS A

01:14:25.694 --> 01:14:26.862

REALLY DIFFICULT TO GET THAT

01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:55.457
BACK DOWN TO LEVELS PRE

01:14:55.524 --> 01:14:58.427
PANDEMIC. BECAUSE CUSTOMERS

REALLY HAVE SHIFTED THEIR-

01:15:00.195 --> 01:15:01.496
THEIR DESIRE FOR CONVENIENCE

01:15:01.563 --> 01:15:03.999

TIME. OFF FOR FOLKS TO FEEL

01:22:32.314 --> 01:22:33.148

THEY HAVE THESE PERSONAL-

01:22:43.425 --> 01:22:45.427
CHALLENGES THAT ARE- WOULD MAKE

01:22:45.493 --> 01:22:46.828
IT DIFFICULT DIFFICULT FOR THEM

BENEFITS AND OTHER THINGS THAT

THEY DON'T HAVE THAT CHILD CARE

BEEN LAID OFF. IN THE END THE

01:29:58.159 --> 01:30:00.161
TYPICAL RESPONSES. WHY MAKE IT

01:30:00.228 --> 01:30:02.330

NOTE THINK ABOUT COMING BACK.

01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:10.805
AND IT'S AND IN ADDITION TO

01:30:10.872 --> 01:30:12.240
THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE REPLACE

01:30:12.306 --> 01:30:13.941
THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THE

01:30:14.008 --> 01:30:15.610
SAME SITUATION. SO IT'S BEEN A

01:30:15.676 --> 01:30:17.044
HUGE PROBLEM AND OUR MEMBERS

01:30:17.111 --> 01:30:19.547
REPORTED TO ME. CONSTANTLY NOT

01:30:19.614 --> 01:30:20.948
JUST THOSE. TRYING TO GET

01:30:21.015 --> 01:30:22.083
PEOPLE TO COME BACK TO WORK THE

01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:23.818
BUTTE PEOPLE TRYING TO FIND NEW

01:30:23.885 --> 01:30:26.120
EMPLOYEES SAME THING IS. THERE

01:30:26.187 --> 01:30:27.288
ARE THOSE SITTING AT HOME DOING

01:30:27.355 --> 01:30:28.756
REALLY WELL SO THEY DON'T GO

01:30:28.823 --> 01:30:31.225
OUT LOOK FOR JOBS. A FEW OTHER

01:30:31.292 --> 01:30:36.197
THINGS- THE PAGA LAWSUIT TO

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:37.131
REALLY A PROBLEM FOR FAMILY

01:30:37.198 --> 01:30:38.733
BUSINESSES THAT'S THE PRIVATE

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:41.702
ATTORNEY JONES ACT- I WOULD

01:30:41.769 --> 01:30:43.738
JUST LIKE IF YOU JUST GIVE ME A

01:30:43.805 --> 01:30:45.706
COUPLE STATEMENTS ON THAT. PAGA

01:30:45.773 --> 01:30:47.141
ALLOWS EMPLOYEES TO SUE ON

01:30:47.208 --> 01:30:48.943
BEHALF OF THE STATE FOR ALMOST

01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:50.545
EVERY LABOR CODE VIOLATIONS AND

01:30:50.611 --> 01:30:52.513
IMPOSE A HUNDRED. DOLLAR FINE

01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:54.282
FOR THE FIRST VIOLATION AND TWO

01:30:54.348 --> 01:30:54.849
HUNDRED FOR EACH SUBSEQUENT

01:30:54.916 --> 01:30:57.185
VIOLATION. SO THE PAGO TURNER'S

01:30:57.251 --> 01:30:58.119
LOOK FOR COMPANIES WITH

01:30:58.186 --> 01:31:00.154
NUMEROUS EMPLOYEES SO I CAN DO

01:31:00.221 --> 01:31:02.390
CLASS ACTION SUITS. AND THESE

01:31:02.456 --> 01:31:04.091
CLAIMS HAVE GROWN MORE THAN

01:31:04.158 --> 01:31:04.859
TENFOLD SINCE THE LAW WAS

01:31:04.926 --> 01:31:06.861
CREATED. ATTORNEYS AVERAGING

01:31:06.928 --> 01:31:08.496
ABOUT FOUR AND FIVE THOUSAND

01:31:08.563 --> 01:31:12.233
DOLLARS PER CASE- AND THE-

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:13.601
UNBELIEVABLY THE AVERAGE

01:31:13.668 --> 01:31:14.902
SETTLEMENT IS ABOUT ONE POINT

01:31:14.969 --> 01:31:16.470
TWO MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THESE

01:31:16.537 --> 01:31:18.773
PAGA SUIT. AND THERE ARE THINGS

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:22.076
IS IT INVOLVED IN THE SUIT SIR

01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:24.078
IS SOLELY AS- YOUR CHECK

01:31:24.145 --> 01:31:26.714
DOESN'T EXACTLY SAY THE SAME

01:31:26.781 --> 01:31:27.315
THING IS WHO YOU THINK YOU'RE

01:31:27.381 --> 01:31:28.950
YOU'RE EMPLOYED BY. THAT THAT'S

01:31:29.016 --> 01:31:31.986
AN ACTUAL MEETING BEING BEEF-

01:31:32.053 --> 01:31:33.821
FINE FOR THAT AS AN EXAMPLE. SO

01:31:33.888 --> 01:31:35.022
THERE'S AN ORGANIZATION CALLED

01:31:35.089 --> 01:31:36.190
THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS AND

01:31:36.257 --> 01:31:37.692
INDUSTRIAL LINES THAT GATHERS

01:31:37.758 --> 01:31:42.330
DATA- I AM VERY PLEASED TO SEE

01:31:42.396 --> 01:31:49.570
THAT. THE- EDT YOU REINSTATED

01:31:49.637 --> 01:31:51.639
THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE SEARCH

01:31:51.706 --> 01:31:53.274
FOR EMPLOYMENT EMPLOYMENT

01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:54.609
NUMBERS SOME OF THIS GETTING

01:31:54.675 --> 01:31:57.211
UNEMPLOYMENT HAS TO NOW AGAIN

01:31:57.278 --> 01:31:58.412
SHOW THAT THEY HAVE BEEN

01:31:58.479 --> 01:32:00.147
WORKING FOR LOOKING FOR WORK

01:32:00.214 --> 01:32:02.516
THAT WAS- PUT ASIDE FOR COVERED

01:32:02.583 --> 01:32:04.619
AND- OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THE

01:32:04.685 --> 01:32:08.022
PROBLEM. THEN THE OTHER THING I

01:32:08.089 --> 01:32:09.690
WANT TO MENTION HIS. THIS IS

01:32:09.757 --> 01:32:13.494
THE BOOK. THAT THE CHAMBER PUTS

01:32:13.561 --> 01:32:16.831
OUT JUST ON HR REGULATIONS IF

01:32:16.898 --> 01:32:18.199
YOU ARE THE BUSINESS OF THE

01:32:18.266 --> 01:32:19.233
STATE THERE'S OVER A THOUSAND

01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:20.968
PAGES YOU HAVE TO BE VERY

01:32:21.035 --> 01:32:23.137
FAMILIAR WITH YOU HAVE TO DO

01:32:23.204 --> 01:32:24.138
PERFECTLY YOU'RE PROBABLY STILL

01:32:24.205 --> 01:32:26.340
GET SUED. BUT THE BETTER YOU DO

01:32:26.407 --> 01:32:27.642
WITH THIS BOOK MAYBE OF YOUR

01:32:27.708 --> 01:32:29.510
JUDGE WILL BE A LITTLE LESS AND

01:32:29.577 --> 01:32:31.412
EVERY YEAR THIS GETS ADDED TO

01:32:31.479 --> 01:32:33.147
ANSWER QUESTIONS REALLY TO

01:32:33.214 --> 01:32:35.149
LEGISLATORS AND THE GOVERNOR IS

01:32:35.216 --> 01:32:36.684
A THOUSAND PAGES OF HR

01:32:36.751 --> 01:32:38.352
REGULATIONS REALLY NOT ENOUGH

01:32:38.419 --> 01:32:41.355
TO WE NEED MORE- I DON'T THINK

01:32:41.422 --> 01:32:43.291
SO IT'S ONE REASON CALIFORNIA

01:32:43.357 --> 01:32:45.626
HAS A HARD TIME COMPETING. WITH

01:32:45.693 --> 01:32:47.428
THE REST OF THE STATE'S. MOST

01:32:47.495 --> 01:32:48.195
OF OUR OTHER STATES WHERE

01:32:48.262 --> 01:32:49.330
PEOPLE ARE GOING DON'T HAVE

01:32:49.397 --> 01:32:51.098
THIS I MEAN THEY HAVE SOMETHING

01:32:51.165 --> 01:32:53.668
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THIS. AND

01:32:53.734 --> 01:32:55.369
THE OTHER BOILERMAKERS NOTHING

01:32:55.436 --> 01:32:56.270
EVER GOES AWAY IT JUST GETS

01:32:56.337 --> 01:32:58.172
ADDED. NOBODY EVER REALLY LOOKS

01:32:58.239 --> 01:33:00.041
IT'S AN SAYS. GOSH THAT'S

01:33:00.107 --> 01:33:01.409
ANTIQUATED AND WHY DO WE NEED

01:33:01.475 --> 01:33:03.044
OUR OR THIS REALLY REPLACE THAT

01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:05.012
OR THIS ON TOP OF THAT. SO

01:33:05.079 --> 01:33:06.113
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS DON'T

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:08.549
HAPPEN JUST WHAT WE HAD. WHAT

01:33:08.616 --> 01:33:11.018
CAN WE DO TO- TO MAKE IT EVEN

01:33:11.085 --> 01:33:11.953
MORE DIFFICULT FOR EMPLOYERS

01:33:12.019 --> 01:33:13.287
AND EMPLOYEES IN THE STATE I

01:33:13.354 --> 01:33:14.588
KNOW THAT'S NOT THE GOAL BUT

01:33:14.655 --> 01:33:16.157
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. THEY ARE.

01:33:16.223 --> 01:33:18.092
I'M ALWAYS IN THE OTHER ON THE

01:33:18.159 --> 01:33:18.626
CAPITAL LONG TIME AND I'M

01:33:18.693 --> 01:33:21.996
ALWAYS. WARY OF THE LAW OF

01:33:22.063 --> 01:33:23.364
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. WHICH

01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:26.667
IS COMES FORTH IN ALMOST EVERY

01:33:26.734 --> 01:33:28.169
BILL AND EVERY INITIATIVE THAT

01:33:28.235 --> 01:33:30.237
THE PEOPLE PASS THERE IS

01:33:30.304 --> 01:33:32.106
SOMETHING THAT REALLY IT WASN'T

01:33:32.173 --> 01:33:35.109
MEANT TO BE THAT HAPPENS AND A

01:33:35.176 --> 01:33:37.111
LOT OF TIMES I JUST OVERLOOKED

01:33:37.178 --> 01:33:40.314
ELASSONA MENTION IS THAT- C. T.

01:33:40.381 --> 01:33:42.383
FUNDING VOCATIONAL TRAINING WAS

01:33:42.450 --> 01:33:44.151
TO CALL FUNDING IS VERY

01:33:44.218 --> 01:33:46.053
CRITICAL- SO THAT UNSKILLED

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:47.855
WORKERS COULD GET SOME SKILLS.

01:33:47.922 --> 01:33:49.924
I'M NOT EVERYBODY CAN GO TO A

01:33:49.991 --> 01:33:51.058
FOUR YEAR COLLEGE PROGRAM NOT

01:33:51.125 --> 01:33:53.294
EVERYBODY REALLY WANTS TO AND

01:33:53.361 --> 01:33:54.195
THERE ARE A LOT OF JOBS THAT

01:33:54.261 --> 01:33:55.663
PAY QUITE WELL BUT YOU NEED

01:33:55.730 --> 01:33:57.565
SOME SKILLS TO GET THEM SO C.

01:33:57.631 --> 01:34:00.668
T. FUNDING IS SOMETHING THAT-

01:34:00.735 --> 01:34:02.870
IS VERY. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET

01:34:02.937 --> 01:34:03.471
A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THE LAST

01:34:03.537 --> 01:34:05.272
FEW YEARS. THERE WAS A TIME

01:34:05.339 --> 01:34:06.507
WHEN THE STATE REALLY WASN'T

01:34:06.574 --> 01:34:08.442
DOING MUCH OF THEIR ALL. AND

01:34:08.509 --> 01:34:10.678
THAT WAS REALLY UNFORTUNATE. I

01:34:10.745 --> 01:34:12.380
DID ONE MAKE ONE OTHER POINT SO

01:34:12.446 --> 01:34:14.515
THE- U. I. UNEMPLOYMENT

01:34:14.582 --> 01:34:16.050
INSURANCE FUND DEBT NOW THE

01:34:16.117 --> 01:34:18.753
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S. TWENTY

01:34:18.819 --> 01:34:19.320
TWO OR TWENTY THREE BILLION

01:34:19.387 --> 01:34:22.556
DOLLARS- AND THERE'S BEEN NO

01:34:22.623 --> 01:34:25.226
EFFORT TO. PAY BACK- THERE WAS

01:34:25.292 --> 01:34:26.594
A PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNOR

01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:27.395
THERE WAS A LEGISLATIVE

01:34:27.461 --> 01:34:29.597
PROPOSAL. I'M TOLD THAT BOTH

01:34:29.663 --> 01:34:30.798
DIED IN THE BUDGET PROCESS SO

01:34:30.865 --> 01:34:32.566
THERE'S WE'RE SAYING THAT WITH

01:34:32.633 --> 01:34:33.067
THIS HUGE DEBT TO THE

01:34:33.134 --> 01:34:34.668
GOVERNMENT. AND WHAT WE'RE

01:34:34.735 --> 01:34:36.103
CONCERNED ABOUT IS IT'LL BE

01:34:36.170 --> 01:34:37.972
PASSED THROUGH TO BUSINESSES AS

01:34:38.039 --> 01:34:40.374
YET ANOTHER TAX. AT THE WORST

01:34:40.441 --> 01:34:42.576
POSSIBLE TIME. I THINK THERE'S

01:34:42.643 --> 01:34:43.778
SOME HOPE THAT THE FEDERAL

01:34:43.844 --> 01:34:46.380
GOVERNMENT MADE- FORGIVE IT BUT

01:34:46.447 --> 01:34:47.548
THERE'S NO INDICATION THAT'S

01:34:47.615 --> 01:34:48.883
GOING TO HAPPEN WHAT MOST

01:34:48.949 --> 01:34:50.951
STATES WITH SMALLER DEBTS DID.

01:34:51.018 --> 01:34:52.086
IS IT TOOK SOME OF THE FEDERAL

01:34:52.153 --> 01:34:53.320
MONIES THAT WERE GIVEN TO THEM

01:34:53.387 --> 01:34:55.222
AND PAID OFF THEIR EMPLOYMENT

01:34:55.289 --> 01:34:57.291
INSURANCE THAT- WE HAVEN'T DONE

01:34:57.358 --> 01:34:58.459
THAT SO THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING

01:34:58.526 --> 01:35:00.428
REALLY GOOD TO DO. AND- THAT'S

01:35:00.494 --> 01:35:03.164
PROBABLY ENOUGH BUT- THANKS FOR

01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:03.964
THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THOSE

01:35:04.031 --> 01:35:05.966
POINTS. RIGHT THANK YOU AND

01:35:06.033 --> 01:35:08.369
THAT YES. YOU'VE GIVEN US IN

01:35:08.436 --> 01:35:09.370
FIVE CATEGORIES OF THINGS THAT

01:35:09.437 --> 01:35:11.472
I ACTUALLY WORK ARE ON MY LIST

01:35:11.539 --> 01:35:12.940
IN NEW WE WANTED TO DIVE INTO.

01:35:13.007 --> 01:35:14.141
GETTING THEIR SIMILAR SOME OF

01:35:14.208 --> 01:35:15.810
THAT THEY AT THE CHALLENGES

01:35:15.876 --> 01:35:17.945
THAT. THE OTHER PANELISTS ON

01:35:18.012 --> 01:35:19.046
THE LANDSCAPE SO BEFORE WE JUMP

01:35:19.113 --> 01:35:20.948
INTO THANKS IN. DEEPER

01:35:21.015 --> 01:35:22.750
CONVERSATION IN EACH OF THOSE

01:35:22.817 --> 01:35:24.752
ISSUES I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE.

01:35:24.819 --> 01:35:26.187
OUR OUR OTHER PANELISTS- AN

01:35:26.253 --> 01:35:27.354

OVERVIEW OF. THE CHALLENGES-

THAT THAT YOU SEE AS BEING. THE

WE ARE ADVANCING RESILIENCE AND

01:36:12.967 --> 01:36:16.504
BUILD ALL OF THOSE WERE REALLY-

01:36:16.570 --> 01:36:19.140
PRIOR TO MY COMING ON BOARD WE

01:36:19.206 --> 01:36:21.909
HAVE A FOURTH STRATEGIC

01:36:21.976 --> 01:36:24.745
OBJECTIVE DATA ON I AM BRINGING

01:36:24.812 --> 01:36:26.280
TO BEAR BASED UPON THE

01:36:26.347 --> 01:36:29.083
EXPERIENCE THAT. I'VE HAD THE

01:36:29.150 --> 01:36:30.918
LAST FOUR YEARS IN THE CENTRAL

01:36:30.985 --> 01:36:33.287
VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT

01:36:33.354 --> 01:36:35.222
IS REALLY TO ADVANCE ECONOMIC

01:36:35.289 --> 01:36:38.192
MOBILITY WE HEARD IT FROM THAT-

01:36:38.259 --> 01:36:42.029
PRIOR PANELISTS ABOUT THE GAPS-

01:36:42.096 --> 01:36:44.365
IT BEAT THAT RACIAL AND ETHNIC

01:36:44.431 --> 01:36:47.201
GAPS BUT THERE ARE GAPS BASED

01:36:47.268 --> 01:36:51.038
ON GENDER AND ZIP CODE AS WELL.

01:36:51.105 --> 01:36:54.275
AND STILL I WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:36:54.341 --> 01:36:55.943
AND ONE OF THE REASONS I AM

01:36:56.010 --> 01:36:58.512
ADVANCING ON ECONOMIC MOBILITY

01:36:58.579 --> 01:36:59.880
AS ONE OF OUR STRATEGIC

01:36:59.947 --> 01:37:04.485
OBJECTIVES THAT WE PREPARER- IN

01:37:04.552 --> 01:37:07.121
OUR ECOSYSTEM TO BE AS

01:37:07.188 --> 01:37:09.557
INCLUSIVE A SMALL BUSINESS

01:37:09.623 --> 01:37:12.126
ECOSYSTEM AS POSSIBLE AND TO

01:37:12.193 --> 01:37:14.929
CREATE CONTRACT READINESS TO

01:37:14.995 --> 01:37:17.865
UNLIMITED OPPORTUNITY GAPS

01:37:17.932 --> 01:37:18.766
ACROSS ZIP CODE RACE AND

01:37:18.832 --> 01:37:22.369
GENDER. AGAIN TO REALLY REMOVED

01:37:22.436 --> 01:37:24.705
THE BARRIERS THAT LEANED AL

01:37:24.772 --> 01:37:26.340
THAT WOMEN AND BI PAP

01:37:26.407 --> 01:37:32.346
BUSINESSES EXPERIENCE AS. STATE

01:37:32.413 --> 01:37:33.280
ATTEMPTED GROUT. I THINK WHAT

01:37:33.347 --> 01:37:35.583
WE SEEN IT IS. THAT THAT'S-

01:37:35.649 --> 01:37:38.219
FACING BUSINESS SAYS- FIRST

01:37:38.285 --> 01:37:40.588
SOME IT'S THE NEED TO PIVOT AND

01:37:40.654 --> 01:37:43.090
TO RETOOL RATE AS DIFFERENT

01:37:43.157 --> 01:37:44.925
NEEDS HAVE EMERGED IN THE

01:37:44.992 --> 01:37:46.193
MARKET PLACE CREATING

01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:48.596
OPPORTUNITY TO DELIVER

01:37:48.662 --> 01:37:51.031
DIFFERENT GOODS AND SERVICES

01:37:51.098 --> 01:37:52.333
THIS INCLUDES A GREATER

01:37:52.399 --> 01:37:54.435
DEPENDENCE ON EASE SALES AND

01:37:54.501 --> 01:37:56.036
MARKETING WE SAW THAT GRAPH

01:37:56.103 --> 01:37:58.405
EARLIER. WITH THE ELECTRONIC

01:37:58.472 --> 01:38:01.775
SALES BEING OFF THE CHARTS- SO

01:38:01.842 --> 01:38:06.747
MUCH GREATER THAN- OTHER AREAS-

01:38:06.814 --> 01:38:08.315
FOR SOME OTHER BUSINESSES IT'S

01:38:08.382 --> 01:38:10.584
STRICTLY ABOUT RECOVERY AND

01:38:10.651 --> 01:38:12.419
CLOSING THE FINANCIAL GAPS THAT

01:38:12.486 --> 01:38:15.756
THE PANDEMIC CREATED AND THOSE

01:38:15.823 --> 01:38:17.024
ARE THINGS THAT LIE. PUT

01:38:17.091 --> 01:38:19.360
CUSTOMER VOLUME ACCESS TO

01:38:19.426 --> 01:38:22.663
INVENTORY ROD THE- TRANSIT

01:38:22.730 --> 01:38:25.566
INTERRUPTIONS AND ACCESSIBILITY

01:38:25.633 --> 01:38:27.768
AND THOSE ARE ALL DIFFERENT-

01:38:27.835 --> 01:38:29.270
DEPENDING ON WHERE YOUR

01:38:29.336 --> 01:38:34.108
BUSINESS IS AND. WHAT BUSINESS

01:38:34.174 --> 01:38:35.743
YOU'RE IN. FOREIGN GROUP SMALL

01:38:35.809 --> 01:38:38.946
BUSINESS. IT'S BEYOND JUST RE

01:38:39.013 --> 01:38:40.948
OPENING AND IT'S REALLY MORE A

01:38:41.015 --> 01:38:43.317
BALLOT REIMAGINING BUSINESS

01:38:43.384 --> 01:38:47.788
ALTOGETHER I IT'S OUTSIDE OF

01:38:47.855 --> 01:38:51.525
THE PANDEMIC KNOW THAT 20% OF

01:38:51.592 --> 01:38:54.094
SMALL BUSINESSES FAIL IN THEIR

01:38:54.161 --> 01:38:57.398
FIRST YEAR. AND AT FIVE YEARS

01:38:57.464 --> 01:38:59.266
HALF OF THOSE NEW BUSINESSES

01:38:59.333 --> 01:39:01.869
WILL HAVE FAILED AND WE HAVE

01:39:01.935 --> 01:39:04.071
FOUND THAT THOSE SURVIVAL RATES

01:39:04.138 --> 01:39:06.407
ARE PRETTY MUCH EVEN ACROSS ALL

01:39:06.473 --> 01:39:09.543
INDUSTRIES. AND THE PANDEMIC

01:39:09.610 --> 01:39:13.314
EXACERBATED AND THOSE TRENDS-

01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:16.884
WE SAW BETTER THAN 40% OF BLACK

01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:18.752
BUSINESSES CLOSED THEIR DOORS

01:39:18.819 --> 01:39:20.854
ALMOST 40% OF LATIN ACTS

01:39:20.921 --> 01:39:23.524
BUSINESSES AND OUR ASIAN

01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:26.126
COUNTERPARTS I'M SIGNIFICANT

01:39:26.193 --> 01:39:28.429
DECLINES AS WELL. BUT DUE TO

01:39:28.495 --> 01:39:29.963
THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES

01:39:30.030 --> 01:39:31.765
AVAILABLE THROUGH STIMULUS

01:39:31.832 --> 01:39:33.934
LOANS GRANT UNEMPLOYMENT MANY

01:39:34.001 --> 01:39:35.769
OF THESE PROPRIETORS ARE LIKELY

01:39:35.836 --> 01:39:38.572
CONSIDERING THEIR OPTIONS RIGHT

01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:41.208
NOW FOR STARTING A NEW VENTURE

01:39:41.275 --> 01:39:42.876

01:39:42.943 --> 01:39:46.980
PREVIOUSLY FELT WAS THEIR

01:39:47.047 --> 01:39:48.682

CALIFORNIA RELIEF GRANT. I

01:42:18.532 --> 01:42:19.600
THINK WE WERE THE FIRST ONES

01:42:19.666 --> 01:42:22.369
OUT OFFERING WEBINARS IT WAS

01:42:22.436 --> 01:42:24.771

WE HAD. WE DID IT EVERY SINGLE

FIRST WEEK WE HAD OVER A

01:42:30.544 --> 01:42:32.079
HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE ATTEND-

COMMERCE THAT IS THE SOLUTION

01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:24.698
FOR SOME BUT I FEEL FOR MOST

01:43:24.765 --> 01:43:26.266
BRICK AND MORTAR BUSINESSES

01:43:26.333 --> 01:43:27.034
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY AN

01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:32.105
OPTION AND REALLY. WHAT THE

01:43:32.172 --> 01:43:32.706
DIVIDE IS YOU KNOW I MEAN HOW

OWNERS THAT DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:43:40.047 --> 01:43:40.981
THE TECHNOLOGY THEY'RE NOT

01:43:41.048 --> 01:43:43.116

PRESENCE WHATSOEVER SO IN THREE

01:43:52.326 --> 01:43:53.694
WEEKS. WE WENT IN AND TAUGHT

01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:55.262
THEM ONE ON ONE. AND IN A GROUP

01:43:55.329 --> 01:43:56.530
SETTING HOW TO ACTUALLY CREATE

01:43:56.597 --> 01:43:58.065
A DIGITAL PRESENCE WHICH- ISN'T

01:43:58.131 --> 01:43:59.566
THAT DIFFICULT BUT FOR PEOPLE

01:43:59.633 --> 01:44:00.601
THAT DON'T HAVE THAT SKILL SET

01:44:00.667 --> 01:44:03.170
IT IS- THERE. THERE THEY WERE

01:44:03.236 --> 01:44:04.171
DRIVING TRAFFIC THE TRAFFIC WAS

01:44:04.237 --> 01:44:06.273
UP SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. AFTER

01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:07.007
THEY WERE ABLE TO JUST FIND

01:44:07.074 --> 01:44:08.075
THEM RIGHT I MEAN YOU COULD

01:44:08.141 --> 01:44:08.909
BEEN STANDING IN FRONT OF ONE

01:44:08.976 --> 01:44:10.110
OF THE DRESS SHOP IS THAT. IT

01:44:10.177 --> 01:44:12.112
CAN SENIOR ADDRESS. AND THEY

01:44:12.179 --> 01:44:13.614
WOULDN'T COME UP YOU KNOW SO

01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:14.448
MAKING SURE THAT THAT'S THAT'S

01:44:14.514 --> 01:44:16.817
UNDERSTOOD- LEASES ARE A BIG

01:44:16.883 --> 01:44:18.819
DEAL. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:44:18.885 --> 01:44:22.322
BRICK AND MORTAR LEASE- IT'S-

01:44:22.389 --> 01:44:23.757
MY- BUSINESSES WERE NOT GIVEN A

01:44:23.824 --> 01:44:24.725
BASEMENT FLOOR. YOU KNOW

01:44:24.791 --> 01:44:26.259
REDUCED RENT THEY WERE GIVEN

01:44:26.326 --> 01:44:27.527
DEFERMENT SO WHAT THAT MEANS

01:44:27.594 --> 01:44:29.396
IS. YOU KNOW IF I'M PAYING BUT

01:44:29.463 --> 01:44:30.197
I PAY TEN DOLLARS A SQUARE

01:44:30.263 --> 01:44:32.165
FOOT. AND I THE AVERAGE STORE

01:44:32.232 --> 01:44:33.533
IZE OF THE THOUSAND THOUSAND

01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:34.635
SQUARE FEET AND PAYING TEN

01:44:34.701 --> 01:44:35.202
THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IN

01:44:35.268 --> 01:44:37.137
RENT. WELL I GOT THAT DIFFERED

01:44:37.204 --> 01:44:38.338
FOR SIX MONTHS OR TWELVE MONTHS

01:44:38.405 --> 01:44:39.873
NOW THAT I'M PAYING FIFTEEN

01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:40.440
THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IN

01:44:40.507 --> 01:44:42.142
RENT. TO THINK ABOUT THE- EXTRA

01:44:42.209 --> 01:44:43.610
EXPENSE AN EXTRA REVENUE I HAVE

01:44:43.677 --> 01:44:45.345
TO DRIVE. JUST TO BREAK EVEN.

01:44:45.412 --> 01:44:47.014
AND THAT'S WHERE MOST BUSINESS

01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:48.348
OWNERS ARE AT RIGHT NOW IS THAT

01:44:48.415 --> 01:44:50.183
THE FIRM IS NOW COMING DUE. AND

01:44:50.250 --> 01:44:51.752
SO I THINK WE HAVEN'T SEEN WHAT

01:44:51.818 --> 01:44:52.953
COMMERCIAL LEASE IS GOING TO

01:44:53.020 --> 01:44:56.023
DO. WITH WHERE WE'RE AT AND-

01:44:56.089 --> 01:44:58.025
YOU KNOW. WITH ACCESS TO

01:44:58.091 --> 01:44:59.226
CAPITAL ME WE'RE REALLY TRYING

01:44:59.292 --> 01:45:00.560
TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE MARKET

01:45:00.627 --> 01:45:01.595
IS I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF

01:45:01.662 --> 01:45:03.163
GRANT PROGRAMS AND PPP AND-

01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:04.865
IDLE. BUT AS THOSE START TO

01:45:04.931 --> 01:45:06.733
SUBSIDE AND GO AWAY. WHAT IS

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:08.669
NEXT AND THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF

01:45:08.735 --> 01:45:09.236
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE

01:45:09.302 --> 01:45:10.604
OUT. AND THE AT THE AVERAGE

01:45:10.671 --> 01:45:12.139
CAPITAL NEED FOR A SMALL

01:45:12.205 --> 01:45:13.440
BUSINESS IS LESS THAN FIFTY

01:45:13.507 --> 01:45:15.008
THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND IT YOU

01:45:15.075 --> 01:45:16.410
CAN ACCESS THAT RIGHT SOME OF

01:45:16.476 --> 01:45:17.377
THE LARGER BANKS DON'T WANT TO

01:45:17.444 --> 01:45:18.745
DO THAT KIND OF A LOAN. BECAUSE

01:45:18.812 --> 01:45:20.347
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY IN

01:45:20.414 --> 01:45:21.782
IT FOR THEM TO SERVICE THAT.

01:45:21.848 --> 01:45:22.849
I'M NOT GET IT TO TWO MORE

01:45:22.916 --> 01:45:25.052
THINGS AND STOP- SUPPLY ISSUES

01:45:25.118 --> 01:45:26.586
ARE A HUGE DEAL. WHEN I JUST

01:45:26.653 --> 01:45:28.522
BRING IT BACK TO MYSELF- I.

01:45:28.588 --> 01:45:29.890
ORDER FROM ONE OF THE LARGEST

01:45:29.956 --> 01:45:30.490
TRUCKING MANUFACTURERS IN THE

01:45:30.557 --> 01:45:31.692
COUNTRY AND I ORDERED A

01:45:31.758 --> 01:45:32.993
THOUSAND POUNDS OF CHOCOLATE

TWO WEEKS AGO. AND THEY DIDN'T

01:45:33.694 --> 01:45:35.829
HAVE ANY. RIGHT SO IMAGINE YOU

01:45:35.896 --> 01:45:37.731
KNOW- YOU KNOW NOT BEING ABLE

01:45:37.798 --> 01:45:39.166
TO GET YOUR SUPPLY TO ACTUALLY

01:45:39.232 --> 01:45:41.034
MAKE WHAT YOU NEED TO. AND THEN

ABOUT RESTAURANT RETAIL AND

01:45:44.504 --> 01:45:46.339
HOSPITALITY. THAT IS WHERE THE

WORKFORCE NEED IS. AND WHEN

01:45:48.341 --> 01:45:49.009

COMPETING WITH THINGS AND IT'S

01:45:51.545 --> 01:45:53.113
EASIER TO. TO STAY ON

01:45:53.180 --> 01:45:55.082
UNEMPLOYMENT THE WAY. IT MAKES

01:45:55.148 --> 01:45:58.085
IT A DIFFICULT- OPTION TO DO TO

01:45:58.151 --> 01:45:59.386
FIND EMPLOYEES I MEAN. I'M TO

01:45:59.453 --> 01:46:00.787
THE POINT WHERE I NEED THE

01:46:00.854 --> 01:46:01.421
INTERVIEW YOU JUST COME IN AND

01:46:01.488 --> 01:46:02.723
START WORKING. RIGHT AND THAT'S

01:46:02.789 --> 01:46:03.724
WHERE A LOT OF BUSINESS OWNERS

01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:05.192

01:46:05.258 --> 01:46:10.497
WITH YOU THERE'S IT'S NOT. A

01:46:10.564 --> 01:46:11.064

DIVE INTO FOR THE NEXT SAID

01:46:22.676 --> 01:46:24.111
TWENTY MINUTES OR SO I'M AND

01:46:24.177 --> 01:46:24.945
ACTUALLY LET'S START WHERE

01:46:25.011 --> 01:46:26.513
WHERE YOU ENDED LET'S PICK UP

01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:29.616
ON THIS THIS QUESTION OF AB

01:46:29.683 --> 01:46:31.251
WORK FORCE AND AS WE SIGN THAT

01:46:31.318 --> 01:46:33.286
THE EARLIER PANEL AND WE

01:46:33.353 --> 01:46:34.621
CONTINUE TO READING AND

01:46:34.688 --> 01:46:35.155
HEADLINE NEWS I THINK ALL

01:46:35.222 --> 01:46:37.824
ACROSS THE COUNTRY- THAT THERE

01:46:37.891 --> 01:46:40.160
IS. THERE'S JUST BEEN

01:46:40.227 --> 01:46:42.229
INCREDIBLY SLOW RETURNED TO

01:46:42.295 --> 01:46:44.464
WORK- IN MANY SECTORS OF THE

01:46:44.531 --> 01:46:47.033
ECONOMY AND I THINK PART OF

01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:49.569
THAT- WE RESPONDED IN CERTAIN

01:46:49.636 --> 01:46:51.404
WAYS TO THIS UNPRECEDENTED

01:46:51.471 --> 01:46:52.839
SHOCK OF THE COVER NINETEEN

01:46:52.906 --> 01:46:54.708
CRISIS I GUESS MY QUESTION IS

01:46:54.775 --> 01:46:55.575
AND I THINK WE KNOW THAT SOME

01:46:55.642 --> 01:46:57.444
OF THAT IS GOING TO STABILIZE

01:46:57.511 --> 01:47:00.647
OVER TIME- AT MR YOU ARE FROM

01:47:00.714 --> 01:47:14.628
THE ALEJO'S. KIND OF TRADE OFF.

01:47:14.694 --> 01:47:15.796
THE OTHER PROVIDED A DIFFERENT

01:47:15.862 --> 01:47:17.230
CONCLUSION TODAY THAN THEY DID

01:47:17.297 --> 01:47:18.431
MAYBE IN MARCH OF TWENTY

01:47:18.498 --> 01:47:21.735
TWENTY- FOR MANY JOBS A LOT OF

01:47:21.802 --> 01:47:24.037
THOSE- I THINK THERE'S TRADE

01:47:24.104 --> 01:47:28.008
OFFS WE'LL START TO STABILIZE

01:47:28.074 --> 01:47:29.676
QUITE NATURALLY I THINK IN AND

01:47:29.743 --> 01:47:31.711
NOT IN LIKE A YEAR IN THE NEXT

01:47:31.778 --> 01:47:32.679
COUPLE OF MONTHS I GUESS DO YOU

01:47:32.746 --> 01:47:34.915
AGREE WITH THAT OR DO YOU YOU

01:47:34.981 --> 01:47:39.152
THINK THAT THERE ARE- SOME. THE

01:47:39.219 --> 01:47:41.154
LAST SCENE I GUESS IT HAS THERE

01:47:41.221 --> 01:47:43.490
BEEN A LASTING SHOCKED TO. THE

01:47:43.557 --> 01:47:48.094
LABOR MARKET- THAT. CAUSES A-

01:47:48.161 --> 01:47:50.397
PROLONGED CONCERN AND WARRANTS

01:47:50.463 --> 01:47:51.765
I GUESS AND YOU KNOW SOME KIND

01:47:51.832 --> 01:47:54.034
OF AN INTERVENTION OR EARLY

01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:54.434
SECOND LONGER TERM

01:47:54.501 --> 01:47:56.636
CONSIDERATIONS. HELLO QUESTION

01:47:56.703 --> 01:47:57.370
DO WE THINK IT'S A SHORT TERM

01:47:57.437 --> 01:47:59.506
ISSUE THAT. IS GOING TO GET

01:47:59.573 --> 01:48:01.541
RESOLVED BY THAT JUST FORCES OF

01:48:01.608 --> 01:48:02.442
SUPPLY AND DEMAND COMING INTO

01:48:02.509 --> 01:48:04.211
EQUILIBRIUM OR IS THERE

01:48:04.277 --> 01:48:04.945
SOMETHING LONGER TERM THAT WE

01:48:05.011 --> 01:48:06.246
ALL NEED TO BE WORRIED ABOUT.

01:48:06.313 --> 01:48:07.347
AND I WOULD SAY A LITTLE BIT OF

01:48:07.414 --> 01:48:10.016
BOTH- THERE ARE PEOPLE ARE

01:48:10.083 --> 01:48:11.451
RELUCTANT GO BACK TO WORK THAT

01:48:11.518 --> 01:48:13.053
HAVE BEEN ORKING FROM HOME.

01:48:13.119 --> 01:48:14.020
THEY LIKE TO WORK FROM HOME

01:48:14.087 --> 01:48:16.523
FOREVER FACT ONE- THE STUDY I

01:48:16.590 --> 01:48:20.026
SAW SAID THAT- IF THERE IS SOME

01:48:20.093 --> 01:48:20.894
OF THE FOLKS WHO WOULD BE

01:48:20.961 --> 01:48:22.495
OFFERED A THIRTY THOUSAND

01:48:22.562 --> 01:48:23.430
DOLLARS MORE TO COME BACK TO

01:48:23.496 --> 01:48:24.831
WORK. FULL TIME IN THE OFFICE

01:48:24.898 --> 01:48:26.266
AND THEY THEY'D RATHER NOT THAT

01:48:26.333 --> 01:48:27.234
RATHER STAY HOME AND NOT GET

01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:28.969
THE PAY. SO THAT'S ONE ISSUE

01:48:29.035 --> 01:48:31.238
THAT'S HAPPENING- I DO THINK

01:48:31.304 --> 01:48:35.508
WHEN THE- PROGRAMS ARE PAYING

01:48:35.575 --> 01:48:36.343
MORE TO STAY HOME- MORE TO STAY

01:48:36.409 --> 01:48:37.344
HOME WITH THOSE FOR. IN

01:48:37.410 --> 01:48:39.179
DISPOSED AN EXCERPT. IF THEY'RE

01:48:39.246 --> 01:48:42.382
NOT PUT BACK INTO. A PLACE I

01:48:42.449 --> 01:48:43.516
THINK THAT'LL HELP TREMENDOUSLY

01:48:43.583 --> 01:48:45.018
BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED TO GO BACK

01:48:45.085 --> 01:48:48.421
TO WORK IN AND GET A JOB. SO

01:48:48.488 --> 01:48:51.258
THERE IS A- THERE CERTAINLY HAS

01:48:51.324 --> 01:48:52.025
BEEN A CHANGE IN PEOPLE'S

01:48:52.092 --> 01:48:54.060
OUTLOOKS. ON HOW TO WORK AND

01:48:54.127 --> 01:48:56.663
HOW THEY WORK IT IS CENTRAL-

01:48:56.730 --> 01:48:57.964
BUT I THINK THEY'RE ALSO A LOT

01:48:58.031 --> 01:49:00.567
OF PEOPLE ARE REALLY S. AND GET

01:49:00.634 --> 01:49:01.201
BACK TO WORK. BECAUSE THEY MISS

01:49:01.268 --> 01:49:03.169
THE- YOU KNOW COOLER TALK IN

01:49:03.236 --> 01:49:04.471
THE SIT AROUND THE OFFICE AND

01:49:04.537 --> 01:49:06.239
TALK ABOUT IDEAS AND- YOU JUST

01:49:06.306 --> 01:49:07.641
DON'T GET THAT. WHEN

01:49:07.707 --> 01:49:09.676
EVERYBODY'S REMOTE AND- THAT

01:49:09.743 --> 01:49:10.944
THAT HAS BEEN MISSING FOR LAST

01:49:11.011 --> 01:49:13.813
YEAR. SO AS I SAID I THINK

01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:17.284
THERE'S SOME OF BOTH. OKAY

01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:19.319
MISTER DANIEL YEAH I WOULD SAY

01:49:19.386 --> 01:49:21.922
THAT I THINK THAT WE WILL SEE-

01:49:21.988 --> 01:49:23.957
A HYBRID ENVIRONMENT MOVING

01:49:24.024 --> 01:49:26.159
FORWARD. I'M BUT I THINK THAT

01:49:26.226 --> 01:49:27.360
THE JOBS NUMBERS THAT WERE

01:49:27.427 --> 01:49:30.430
RELEASED IN IN JUNE I BELIEVE-

01:49:30.497 --> 01:49:32.799
WE ADDED MORE THAN THREE

01:49:32.866 --> 01:49:34.000
HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS. IN

01:49:34.067 --> 01:49:36.269
CALIFORNIA SO I THINK IT'S FAIR

01:49:36.336 --> 01:49:38.838
TO SAY. THAT THERE IS A DIRECT

01:49:38.905 --> 01:49:40.440
CORRELATION BETWEEN THE PUBLIC

01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:50.050
OPTIMISTIC. I WITH A COSTLY

01:49:50.116 --> 01:49:51.318

MAY BE SOME THINGS THAT WE CAN

01:50:15.508 --> 01:50:17.410

WITH THE TRADES IS EXTREMELY

01:57:52.899 --> 01:57:57.170
IMPORTANT. TO REASONS- IT GIVE

01:57:57.236 --> 01:58:02.942
THIS UP- RELIEF I THINK OF FOR-

01:58:03.009 --> 01:58:04.644
KIDS WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE GO

01:58:04.710 --> 01:58:07.680
INTO DEBT. PURSUING A FOUR YEAR

01:58:07.747 --> 01:58:10.983

TOMORROW AREA OF EXPERTISE BUT

01:58:22.094 --> 01:58:23.863
ALSO MAKE EXCELLENT SMALL

01:58:23.930 --> 01:58:27.166
BUSINESS OWNERS. TRADESMEN AND

01:58:27.233 --> 01:58:29.202
WOMEN AND SO WHAT I'M

01:58:29.268 --> 01:58:32.338
PARTICULARLY INTERESTED. IN THE

01:58:32.405 --> 01:58:34.774
TRADES AND GETTING MORE. SOONER

SCHOOLS AND THROUGH THE

01:58:39.011 --> 01:58:40.313
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS IN

01:58:40.379 --> 01:58:42.114
ALMATY INDUSTRY. BECAUSE I

01:58:42.181 --> 01:58:44.650
THINK WE ARE SEEING A GAP AS MR

01:58:44.717 --> 01:58:46.752
RUBIN IS SET. WITH HIGH SCHOOLS

01:58:46.819 --> 01:58:49.355
DOING AWAY WITH THAT- IT IS

01:58:49.422 --> 01:58:51.023
JUST BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DRAIN A

01:58:51.090 --> 01:58:53.593
AND- WE'RE- VERY QUICKLY MOVING

01:58:53.659 --> 01:58:55.194
TO A PLACE WHERE WE WON'T HAVE

01:58:55.261 --> 01:58:57.930
ENOUGH TRADES PEOPLE- SO WE

01:58:57.997 --> 01:59:00.500
NEED TO DO SOMETHING. I THINK

01:59:00.566 --> 01:59:02.401
IN ORDER TO STEM THAT TIDE. CAN

01:59:02.468 --> 01:59:04.070
YOU MADE A GREAT POINT ABOUT-

01:59:04.136 --> 01:59:05.705
TRADES PEOPLE BECOMING A

01:59:05.771 --> 01:59:07.840
BUSINESS PEOPLE- HOMEBUILDING

01:59:07.907 --> 01:59:09.675
HAS BECOME KIND OF A CORPORATE-

01:59:09.742 --> 01:59:11.143
INDUSTRY A LOT OF THE BIG

01:59:11.210 --> 01:59:12.612
BUILDERS YOU KNOW. PROBABLY THE

01:59:12.678 --> 01:59:14.547
PRIVATE 40% OF THE PRODUCT 50%

01:59:14.614 --> 01:59:16.816
NOW BUT- THE TRADE CONTRACTORS

01:59:16.883 --> 01:59:18.918
ALMOST ALL HOMEGROWN. IS

01:59:18.985 --> 01:59:19.852
STARTED OUT THEIR TRADE IS A

01:59:19.919 --> 01:59:21.454
FRAME OR A CARPENTER OR-

01:59:21.521 --> 01:59:23.489
WHATEVER. AND STARTED A SMALL

01:59:23.556 --> 01:59:25.157
BUSINESS SOME GOTTEN VERY BIG.

01:59:25.224 --> 01:59:26.659
BUT TYPICALLY THERE'S THEY'RE

01:59:26.726 --> 01:59:27.894
ABOUT TO TWENTY SOME

01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:29.695
SUBCONTRACTORS TRADE CONTRACTS

01:59:29.762 --> 01:59:37.603
WITH EACH JOB. AND MOST OF

01:59:37.670 --> 01:59:38.271
THOSE ARE EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID.

01:59:38.337 --> 01:59:39.505
YEAH WELL AND I THINK THE OTHER

01:59:39.572 --> 01:59:40.673
ANOTHER POINT IN IT SO MUCH

01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:43.309
BACK TO THE DIGITAL EVERYONE

01:59:43.376 --> 01:59:44.443
ONE ASPECT THE JUST TO FILTER

01:59:44.510 --> 01:59:45.778
BY IT WILL BE TALK ABOUT. WORK

01:59:45.845 --> 01:59:48.180
FORCE TO. AND EMPHASIZE JUST

01:59:48.247 --> 01:59:49.615
HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS THE PRE

01:59:49.682 --> 01:59:50.716
PANDEMIC WE WERE SEEN

01:59:50.783 --> 01:59:52.251

ARE JOB WITH NUMBERS WERE

01:59:56.055 --> 01:59:57.590
SLOWING. NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE

WEREN'T HIRING BUT BECAUSE

01:59:59.025 --> 02:00:01.360
INCREASINGLY THE SKILLS OF OUR

02:00:01.427 --> 02:00:03.062

INCREASINGLY TECHNOLOGY DRIVEN

02:00:06.165 --> 02:00:08.401
ECONOMY AND- I THINK THE BETTER

02:00:08.467 --> 02:00:10.570
JOB THAT WE CAN DO AS- AS

02:00:10.636 --> 02:00:13.005

WHO'S DOING I'VE- GOT MY HEART

02:07:09.888 --> 02:07:12.424
RATE OF A- MILLION DOLLARS IN

THEM WELL THIS IS IT'S VERY

02:07:20.566 --> 02:07:22.835
DIFFICULT TO SAY BECAUSE- IT

02:07:22.901 --> 02:07:23.369
DEPENDS ON HOW THEY WOULD

02:07:23.435 --> 02:07:25.104
DECIDE TO PAY IT BACK. AND WHAT

02:07:25.170 --> 02:07:27.706
THEY MIGHT DO- AS I SAID THAT I

02:07:27.773 --> 02:07:29.241
THINK THERE'S SOME HOPE AND IN

02:07:29.308 --> 02:07:31.276
MANY FRONTS THAT- SOME I LIKE A

02:07:31.343 --> 02:07:32.111
BUILD UP BY THE FEDERAL

02:07:32.177 --> 02:07:33.946
GOVERNMENT- THEY HAVE ACTUALLY

02:07:34.013 --> 02:07:35.514
GOT ENOUGH TO PAY IT BACK WITH

02:07:35.581 --> 02:07:36.281
A CHOSE TO SPEND ON OTHER

02:07:36.348 --> 02:07:38.217
THINGS THEY'VE BEEN. I THINK

02:07:38.283 --> 02:07:38.751
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND

02:07:38.817 --> 02:07:40.486
CERTAINLY LEGISLATURE. SO IT'S

02:07:40.552 --> 02:07:43.455
VERY HARD TO SAY- WHAT WOULD

02:07:43.522 --> 02:07:45.224
ULTIMATELY HAPPEN I KNOW WE HAD

02:07:45.290 --> 02:07:47.359
A TEN BILLION DOLLAR DEBT AT

02:07:47.426 --> 02:07:48.961
ONE TIME. WE FINALLY GOT IT

02:07:51.130 --> 02:07:52.965
PAID OFF BUT WAS BY HIGHER

02:07:53.032 --> 02:07:53.966
PAYROLL TAX BUT I CAN'T TELL

02:07:54.033 --> 02:07:56.568
EXACTLY. WHAT WENT UP BUT-

02:07:56.635 --> 02:07:58.003
THAT'S ANOTHER FOR YOUR BILL

02:07:58.070 --> 02:07:59.271
BUSINESSES DO UNDERSTAND

02:07:59.338 --> 02:08:00.406
THEY'RE GOING TO GET THIS OUR

02:08:00.472 --> 02:08:01.640
MEMBERS KNOW BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN

02:08:01.707 --> 02:08:02.641
TALKING ABOUT IT IN A

02:08:02.708 --> 02:08:06.478
NEWSLETTER. BUT JUST- ONE MORE

02:08:06.545 --> 02:08:08.147
TAX INCREASE TO WORRY ABOUT.

02:08:08.213 --> 02:08:09.314
BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT WOULD

02:08:09.381 --> 02:08:10.916
BE A HAVE AN ACCENT AND I

02:08:10.983 --> 02:08:13.018
SHOULD'VE I HAD. SOME EXAMPLES

02:08:13.085 --> 02:08:14.386
I KNEW THAT THE CALIFORNIA

02:08:14.453 --> 02:08:15.821
BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE HAD DONE A

02:08:15.888 --> 02:08:18.123
COUPLE SIDES WERE- THEY MAPPED

02:08:18.190 --> 02:08:19.925
OUT AND THAT A SCENARIO FOR

02:08:19.992 --> 02:08:21.593
CALIFORNIA BUSINESS BUT- I

02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:24.163
THINK THAT THE- THE PUNCH LINE

02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:26.365
REALLY IS KIND OF ABSENT ANY.

02:08:26.432 --> 02:08:28.967
INTERVENTION OR ACTION. THAT

02:08:29.034 --> 02:08:31.904
THIS WILL FALL AS A BURDEN ON

02:08:31.970 --> 02:08:34.106
CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES AND

02:08:34.173 --> 02:08:34.973
THAT WHAT HAPPENS IS PAYROLL

02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:37.443
TAXES. INCREASE A LITTLE BIT

02:08:37.509 --> 02:08:40.612
EVERY SINGLE YEAR- TO TAKE

02:08:40.679 --> 02:08:42.114
COVER THE COST UNTIL THE DEBT

02:08:42.181 --> 02:08:43.782
IS PAID OFF AND THE EXPECTATION

02:08:43.849 --> 02:08:45.818
WOULD BETHAT THOSE INCREASES.

02:08:45.884 --> 02:08:48.353
I WOULD. WOULD BE IN PLACE FOR

02:08:48.420 --> 02:08:50.122
THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS IN ORDER

02:08:50.189 --> 02:08:51.623
FOR US TO PAY OFF THIS THIS

02:08:51.690 --> 02:08:55.227
BALL- SO I KNOW I AM. THIS IS.

02:08:55.294 --> 02:08:55.994
A FULL DISCLOSURE I'M

02:08:56.061 --> 02:08:58.063
ADVOCATING. IN THE LEGISLATURE

02:08:58.130 --> 02:09:04.736
THAT WE DO TAKE SOME ACTION. TO

02:09:04.803 --> 02:09:05.938
ADDRESS THIS I THINK. I WE- THE

02:09:06.004 --> 02:09:06.538
NINETY WAS AN PRESIDENT I CAN

02:09:06.605 --> 02:09:07.139
SHOCK AND WE HAVE STEPPED UP

02:09:07.206 --> 02:09:08.073
AND STEPPED IN. TO FILL THE

02:09:08.140 --> 02:09:10.509
GAPS IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS-

02:09:10.576 --> 02:09:11.276
I THINK IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE IF

02:09:11.343 --> 02:09:13.011
WE DON'T. STEP UP IN THIS

02:09:13.078 --> 02:09:15.714
REGARD. I GUESS- MS GRAYER IS

02:09:15.781 --> 02:09:17.149
THIS SOMETHING THAT YOU ALL ARE

02:09:17.216 --> 02:09:19.017

HEARING ABOUT FROM. BUSINESSES

02:09:21.086 --> 02:09:23.088
LARGE OR SMALL- AS WE START TO

02:09:23.155 --> 02:09:25.090
COME OUT OF THE PANDEMIC I YOU

02:09:25.157 --> 02:09:27.759
KNOW I HAVE TO BE HONEST IT HAS

02:09:27.826 --> 02:09:30.028
NOT BEEN ON THE RADAR YAK OKAY.

02:09:30.095 --> 02:09:32.364

WOULD BE ONE OF THEM. YEP WHAT

02:09:38.604 --> 02:09:39.872
I THINK IS THERE WAS THERE WAS

02:09:39.938 --> 02:09:40.906
CERTAINLY AS YOU SAID MR EVAN

02:09:40.973 --> 02:09:42.941

FEDS WOULD. ADD CLOSE THAT GAP-

02:09:46.178 --> 02:09:47.913
I THINK AND- MY UNDERSTANDING

02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:51.517
IS THERE'S ONLY EIGHTEEN STATES

KIND OF. I YOU I DEBT RIGHT NOW

SAYS THAT- THAT HOPE IS

02:09:56.054 --> 02:09:58.457
PROBABLY. NOT GOING TO BE

02:09:58.524 --> 02:09:59.391
REALIZED ON THAT THE FEDS ARE

02:15:30.489 --> 02:15:31.289
COMPREHENSIVE VERY BIG BUT I

02:15:31.356 --> 02:15:33.091
WOULD SAY. THE ONE THING

02:15:33.158 --> 02:15:34.359
CALIFORNIA COULD DO TO KEEP

02:15:34.426 --> 02:15:37.028

THERE JUST NO WAY TO KEEP UP.

02:15:45.170 --> 02:15:46.438

REAL QUICK THAT THAT WE'RE

02:17:08.987 --> 02:17:10.021
DOING THAT REALLY KIND OF OFF

02:17:10.088 --> 02:17:11.222
THAT EXACTLY WHAT WE STARTED

02:17:11.289 --> 02:17:12.457
WITH WITH THE GOVERNOR'S

02:17:12.524 --> 02:17:14.693
OFFICE. AND GOBIZ ON THE AND

02:17:14.759 --> 02:17:16.194
DIGITAL PROGRAMMING. I'M

02:17:16.261 --> 02:17:17.128
WORKING WITH THE CITIES OF

02:17:17.195 --> 02:17:18.730
GARDEN GROVE IN CITY OF UP WHEN

02:17:18.797 --> 02:17:19.898
A PARK AND WE'RE BUILDING A

02:17:19.965 --> 02:17:21.533
PROGRAM WHERE. WE TAKE AN

02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:22.634
EXISTING BRICK AND MORTAR

02:17:22.701 --> 02:17:24.469
BUSINESSES AND TEACHING THEM

02:17:24.536 --> 02:17:25.971
HOW TO USE PAID ADVERTISING AND

02:17:26.037 --> 02:17:26.871
THEN ONCE THEY COMPLETE THE

02:17:26.938 --> 02:17:27.706
PROGRAM THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING

02:17:27.772 --> 02:17:29.741
TO GET A GRANT FROM THE CITY-

02:17:29.808 --> 02:17:30.942
THAT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A

02:17:31.009 --> 02:17:31.610
THOUSAND DOLLARS TO ACTUALLY

02:17:31.676 --> 02:17:32.744
USE PAID ADVERTISING TO DRIVE

02:17:32.811 --> 02:17:34.346
TRAFFIC INTO THEIR BUSINESS.

02:17:34.412 --> 02:17:35.780
AND WHEN YOU EXTRAPOLATE THAT

02:17:35.847 --> 02:17:36.348
ACROSS THE MAIN STREET OR

02:17:36.414 --> 02:17:38.450
DOWNTOWN THE EFFECT THAT THAT

02:17:38.516 --> 02:17:40.251

02:17:40.318 --> 02:17:41.553
TEACH BUSINESSES HOW TO USE.

02:17:41.620 --> 02:17:42.687
PAID ADVERTISING SO I THINK

02:17:42.754 --> 02:17:44.055
THAT IS DEFINITELY A WAVE OF

02:17:44.122 --> 02:17:45.190
THE FUTURE AND WE'RE STARTING

02:17:45.256 --> 02:17:46.691

THAT WHEN EMPIRE. AND SO I

02:17:56.067 --> 02:17:57.969

DISCUSSION. IT'S ALSO REALLY

02:24:15.079 --> 02:24:18.483
EASY. TO FORGET. EXACTLY WHAT

02:24:18.549 --> 02:24:20.118
HAPPENED IN MARCH AND SINCE SO

02:24:20.184 --> 02:24:21.753
I APPRECIATE IT WE'RE VERY

02:24:21.819 --> 02:24:23.988
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT RE OPENING-

02:24:24.055 --> 02:24:25.590
AND CERTAINLY GRATEFUL TO BE

02:24:25.656 --> 02:24:26.290
ABLE TO DO SO SINCE JUNE

02:24:26.357 --> 02:24:28.493
FIFTEENTH- A COUPLE THINGS I

02:24:28.559 --> 02:24:30.495
WOULD POINT OUT. 85% OF OUR

02:24:30.561 --> 02:24:31.396
MEMBERSHIP ARE THOSE

02:24:31.462 --> 02:24:32.930
INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY

02:24:32.997 --> 02:24:34.532
RESTAURANTS THAT ARE SPREAD

02:24:34.599 --> 02:24:35.266
THROUGHOUT YOUR DISTRICT AND

02:24:35.333 --> 02:24:37.301
OTHERS. SO THERE IS A LOT OF

02:24:37.368 --> 02:24:38.403
OPTIMISM BUT THE CLOSURES

02:24:38.469 --> 02:24:40.438
IMPACTED EVERYBODY UNIQUELY

02:24:40.505 --> 02:24:42.907
AND- REGARDLESS OF WHAT SIZE OR

02:24:42.974 --> 02:24:44.675
SHAPE OF RESTAURANT YOU WERE.

02:24:44.742 --> 02:24:45.710
YOU ARE FACED WITH THE SAME

02:24:45.777 --> 02:24:47.412
HEALTH ORDERS FROM THE STATE

02:24:47.478 --> 02:24:48.846
AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT

02:24:48.913 --> 02:24:51.015
REQUIRED YOU TO CLOSE. BAND

02:24:51.082 --> 02:24:52.717
OUTDOOR DINING IN CERTAIN CASES

02:24:52.784 --> 02:24:54.252
ABANDONED OR DINING IN CERTAIN

02:24:54.318 --> 02:24:55.920
CASES AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

02:24:55.987 --> 02:24:57.388
NOT EVERY RESTAURANT IS

02:24:57.455 --> 02:24:58.923
EQUIPPED ARE INTERESTED OR ABLE

02:24:58.990 --> 02:25:01.125
TO DO TAKE OUT. SO MANY DID

02:25:01.192 --> 02:25:02.427
TAKE OUT AT AN EXTREME

02:25:02.493 --> 02:25:04.228
FINANCIAL LOSS AND THAT WAS AN

02:25:04.295 --> 02:25:05.496
ATTEMPT TO KEEP A FEW EMPLOYEES

02:25:05.563 --> 02:25:07.098
ON- AND TO SERVE THEIR

02:25:07.165 --> 02:25:08.566
COMMUNITIES SO. WE'RE

02:25:08.633 --> 02:25:10.101
DEFINITELY NOT OUT OF THE WOODS

02:25:10.168 --> 02:25:11.436
I'D SAY THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE

02:25:11.502 --> 02:25:13.538
RIGHT NOW IS EVERYBODY IS

02:25:13.604 --> 02:25:15.640
TRYING TO RE HIRE ALL AT ONCE.

02:25:15.706 --> 02:25:16.941
AND SO THE HIRING CHALLENGES

02:25:17.008 --> 02:25:18.509
ARE ACROSS THE BOARD WE NOTES

02:25:18.576 --> 02:25:21.245
FOR MANY INDUSTRIES IT'S

02:25:21.312 --> 02:25:21.712
CERTAINLY TRUE FOR THE

02:25:21.779 --> 02:25:22.814
RESTAURANT COMMUNITY. AND SO

02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:23.748
THAT'S GONNA TAKE SOME TIME TO

02:25:23.815 --> 02:25:26.317
WORK THROUGH. I THINK HE EVEN-

02:25:26.384 --> 02:25:28.352
JUST TO STOP FOR A MINUTE WE

02:25:28.419 --> 02:25:30.188
WERE TRYING AS A STATE TO LIMIT

02:25:30.254 --> 02:25:32.190
THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE. TO COME

02:25:32.256 --> 02:25:34.258
BACK AGAINST COVE IT. OUR WHOLE

02:25:34.325 --> 02:25:36.060
BUSINESS MODEL IS GATHERING

02:25:36.127 --> 02:25:38.229
PEOPLE- WERE ALSO ONE OF THE

02:25:38.296 --> 02:25:39.931
MOST LABOR INTENSIVE.

02:25:39.997 --> 02:25:41.999
INDUSTRIES IN THE STATE- WE

02:25:42.066 --> 02:25:43.768
EMPLOYEES SOME OF THE MOST MOST

02:25:43.835 --> 02:25:45.536
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE. AND JUST IN

02:25:45.603 --> 02:25:46.504
THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THE

02:25:46.571 --> 02:25:48.339
PANDEMIC NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:25:48.406 --> 02:25:49.707
RESTAURANT WORKERS WERE. LAID

02:25:49.774 --> 02:25:51.409
OFF OR FURLOUGHED SO THE HOPE

02:25:51.476 --> 02:25:53.311
IS TO BRING MANY OF THEM BACK-

02:25:53.377 --> 02:25:54.612
THAT'S THE FIRST ORDER OF

02:25:54.679 --> 02:25:56.614
BUSINESS. AND YOU KNOW SOME OF

02:25:56.681 --> 02:25:58.116
THE ON GOING CHALLENGES ARE

02:25:58.182 --> 02:25:59.484
CERTAINLY A FEW THAT HAVE BEEN

02:25:59.550 --> 02:26:00.618
MENTIONED THE SUPPLY CHAIN

02:26:00.685 --> 02:26:02.587
ISSUES. I THINK ARE TRUE FOR

02:26:02.653 --> 02:26:04.188
JUST ABOUT EVERY INDUSTRY

02:26:04.255 --> 02:26:06.190
CERTAINLY TRUE FOR RESTAURANTS-

02:26:06.257 --> 02:26:08.526
EVERYTHING FROM FOOD COSTS- TO

02:26:08.593 --> 02:26:09.460
EVERYTHING ELSE ACROSS THE

02:26:09.527 --> 02:26:11.028
BOARD OUR OUR WAY UP AND THEN

02:26:11.095 --> 02:26:12.430
THERE'S JUST AVAILABILITY LOTS

02:26:12.497 --> 02:26:14.465
OF THINGS AREN'T AVAILABLE. AND

02:26:14.532 --> 02:26:15.399
SO WE'RE CERTAINLY ASKING FOR

02:26:15.466 --> 02:26:16.868
LOTS OF PATIENTS- IN

02:26:16.934 --> 02:26:18.202
RESTAURANTS SPECIFICALLY JUST

02:26:18.269 --> 02:26:21.405
DUE TO THAT- 60% OF

02:26:21.472 --> 02:26:22.673
CALIFORNIA'S RESTAURANTS ARE

02:26:22.740 --> 02:26:24.742
OWNED BY PEOPLE OF COLOR. OF

02:26:24.809 --> 02:26:27.145
THE RESTAURANTS- THROUGHOUT THE

02:26:27.211 --> 02:26:28.779
STATE MOST OF THOSE OPERATORS

02:26:28.846 --> 02:26:29.814
AND OWNERS LIVE RIGHT THERE IN

02:26:29.881 --> 02:26:32.416
THEIR COMMUNITY SO THEY ARE THE

02:26:32.483 --> 02:26:33.684
FABRIC OF THAT COMMUNITY.

02:26:33.751 --> 02:26:34.752
THERE'S BEEN SOME RELIEF AT THE

02:26:34.819 --> 02:26:36.420
FEDERAL LEVEL THE MOST RECENT

02:26:36.487 --> 02:26:38.556
RESTAURANT REVITALIZATION FUND.

02:26:38.623 --> 02:26:39.824
ACTUALLY RAN OUT OF MONEY

02:26:39.891 --> 02:26:41.359
BEFORE HALF OF THE APPLICANTS

02:26:41.425 --> 02:26:43.227
IN CALIFORNIA WERE ABLE TO GET-

02:26:43.294 --> 02:26:45.029
ANY ASSISTANCE SO. THERE IS

02:26:45.096 --> 02:26:46.430
STILL TREMENDOUS NEED AND I

02:26:46.497 --> 02:26:47.632
THINK JUST TO WRAP IT UP AND

02:26:47.698 --> 02:26:49.267
SAY. YOU KNOW THERE'S GOING TO

02:26:49.333 --> 02:26:51.035
BE MASSIVE INDEBTEDNESS FROM

02:26:51.102 --> 02:26:52.603
RESTAURATEURS MOVING FORWARD

02:26:52.670 --> 02:26:54.405
THAT'S A CHALLENGE. THE SUPPLY

02:26:54.472 --> 02:26:56.207
CHAIN ISSUES HAVE HIT ON A BIT.

02:26:56.274 --> 02:26:57.909
THE HIRING ISSUES ARE COMPLEX

02:26:57.975 --> 02:27:00.011
BUT THEY'RE REAL- THERE'S A

02:27:00.077 --> 02:27:01.212
NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS I THINK TO

02:27:01.279 --> 02:27:03.181
THAT- AND THEN YOU MENTIONED

02:27:03.247 --> 02:27:05.183
THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE-

02:27:05.249 --> 02:27:06.684
SOLVENCY ISSUE WHICH I REALLY

02:27:06.751 --> 02:27:08.953
APPRECIATE AND- YOU KNOW. THIS

02:27:09.020 --> 02:27:10.221
IS GONNA BE A MULTI YEAR OF

02:27:10.288 --> 02:27:11.556
RECOVERY FOR RESTAURANTS SO

02:27:11.622 --> 02:27:13.391
IT'S GONNA BE A LONG LONG LONG

02:27:13.457 --> 02:27:14.926
RUN WAY. AND WE'RE GONNA NEED

02:27:14.992 --> 02:27:16.460
SOME ASSISTANCE ALONG THE WAY.

02:27:16.527 --> 02:27:17.662
BUT WE'RE ALSO GONNA NEED TO

02:27:17.728 --> 02:27:18.229
MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO

02:27:18.296 --> 02:27:19.931
CLUTTER ON THE RUNWAY CLUTTER

02:27:19.997 --> 02:27:21.666
WOULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF THE

02:27:21.732 --> 02:27:22.767
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SOLVENCY

02:27:22.833 --> 02:27:24.535
ISSUE. WE'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE

02:27:24.602 --> 02:27:27.138
BEFORE WE SAW IN 200-089-1011

02:27:27.205 --> 02:27:29.807
AND BEYOND. AND WHAT IT AMOUNTS

02:27:29.874 --> 02:27:31.242
TO IS WE REPAY THAT DEBT IS

02:27:31.309 --> 02:27:33.411
EMPLOYERS. AND IT'S PER

02:27:33.477 --> 02:27:35.780
EMPLOYEE SO IT'S A TAX PER

02:27:35.846 --> 02:27:38.616
EMPLOYEE TO PAY THAT BACK IN SO

02:27:38.683 --> 02:27:39.951
WITH RESTAURANTS THAT ASK YOU

02:27:40.017 --> 02:27:40.751
TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN YOU'RE

02:27:40.818 --> 02:27:42.386
TALKING ABOUT LARGE SMALL.

02:27:42.453 --> 02:27:43.454
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS

02:27:43.521 --> 02:27:44.488
RESTAURANTS ARE LABOR

02:27:44.555 --> 02:27:46.390
INTENSIVE. SMALL RESTAURANTS

02:27:46.457 --> 02:27:48.426
USE A LOT OF PEOPLE. SO WHAT

02:27:48.492 --> 02:27:50.261
YOU OFTEN CONSIDER SMALL MAY

02:27:50.328 --> 02:27:51.596
NOT NECESSARILY BE SMALL IN THE

02:27:51.662 --> 02:27:53.798
RESTAURANT CONTACT SO. I LEAVE

AND I SURE HOPE WE CAN-

02:27:58.102 --> 02:27:59.170

THEY DON'T HAVE A MARKET

02:32:03.747 --> 02:32:05.483
DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH.

CAPITAL THEY GET DOESN'T MATTER

02:32:07.351 --> 02:32:09.220
HOW MUCH CONSULTING THE GAP.

02:32:09.286 --> 02:32:10.154
AND JUST THINK ABOUT THE

02:32:10.221 --> 02:32:12.256
STATE'S ROLE IN CREATING A

02:32:12.323 --> 02:32:14.825
