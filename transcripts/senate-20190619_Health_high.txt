THANK YOU. IS THERE A MOTION. OKAY IT'S BEEN MOVED FIVE NUMBER -- GONZALEZ AT SIX THREE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. HER TITLE LEYVA MITCHELL MONNING RUBIO. ALL RIGHT -- AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE AN IDEA. BILL NUMBER ITEM NUMBER TWELVE AB ELEVEN THIRTY ONE I DO IF YOU'RE CHEN THE FULL NAME IS CHAIRMAN RIO -- I WANT TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENT AND THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF WHAT'S WORK ON THIS BILL -- CHRONIC DISEASES EXPENSIVE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASES IT UTILIZES DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF HEALTHCARE RESOURCES A CHRONIC DISEASE ACCOUNTS 476% OF ALL PHYSICIAN VISITS 81% OF ALL HOSPITAL VISITS AND 91%. OF ALL PRESCRIPTIONS FILLED MANY PATIENTS ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH MULTIPLE CHRONIC DISEASES DO NOT REACH THE CLINICAL GOALS OF THERAPY DUE TO SUB OPTIMAL MEDICATION USE. THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES BY PROVIDING GREATER COORDINATION OF MEDICATIONS TAKEN BY THE STATE'S MOST VULNERABLE AND MOST ILL POPULATIONS IN THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM. WITH ME TODAY HAVE A NUMBER OF MINUTE WITNESSES TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AND ALLOW THEM TO DO SOME CELLS. THANK YOU WITNESSES. FOR GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR TIM VALDERRAMA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF HEALTH SYSTEM PHARMACISTS WERE CO SPONSOR OF THE MEASURE AND WE'RE JOINED BY JONATHAN WATANABE WHO'S AN EXPERT ON COMPREHENSIVE MEDIC MEDICATION MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER. I'M JUST ONE OF IN CLINICAL FACULTY AT THE RISK CALIFORNIA'S SAN DIEGO SKAGGS SCHOOL OF PHARMACY AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES I'M ALSO A HEALTH ECONOMICS PROFESSOR AS WELL AS DIRECTOR CORPSES BY TRAINING. AND SO -- HOW IT REALLY CAME TO THIS WAS THAT WE WOULD SEE OFTENTIMES IN THE WORK WE WERE DOING LOOKING AT THE COST OF READ MISSIONS? MORTALITY -- HOSPITALIZATIONS AND EXTENDED VISITS RETURN VISITS TO PHYSICIANS WE OFTEN SEE THAT MET MUCH OF THAT WAS DUE TO OPTIMISE. MEDICATIONS NOT BEING OPTIMIZE SO REALLY NOT BEING BUILT EXACTLY FOR PURPOSE TO REGION ACHIEVABLE CLINICAL GOAL THEIR PRESCRIBED MEDICATION BUT WASN'T EXACTLY IDEALIZED TO PREVENT. FURTHER FOLLOW UP OR PREVENT FURTHER SICKNESS. AND SO WE WOULD OFTEN SEE THAT THE THE COSTA REPORTED ON THIS NATIONALLY WERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF TWO HUNDRED NINETY BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. WE OFTEN SAW THAT NUMBER REPORTED ROUTINELY THAT THE COST OF THIS NOT OPTIMIZED MEDICATIONS ARE NOT GETTING THE MEDICATIONS BILL FOR THE PURPOSE OF OF MEETING THE GLOBAL GOAL WAS COSTING CLOSE THREE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. BUT THAT WAS BASED ON TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT NUMBERS AND A LOT OF HAPPENED SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT INCLUDE. EXPANSION OF MEDICARE PART D. CHANGES IN A CA INCREASING THE COST AND IN GENERAL WITH WITH MEDICAL COSTS AS WELL AS MEDICATION COST. SO WE CHOSE TO UPDATE THAT USING MORE VALID SOURCES AND LOOKING AT IF WE COULD GET A BETTER READ ON THE CURRENT COSTS. AND WE DID THAT THE ESTIMATE TURNED INTO FIVE OR TWETY EIGHT POINT FOUR BILLION OLLARS. ANNUALLY FOR THE COST OF THIS NON OPTIMIZE MEDICATION IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH EQUATES TO ABOUT 16%. OF TOTAL HEALTHCARE SPENDING UNITED STATES SO REALLY AMOUNTS TO A WE FOUND THIS NUMBER UPDATED AND WHAT WE COULD DO ABOUT THAT. PART OF THAT WAS EXPANSION TO LOOKING AT ONE SOLUTION WAS COMPREHENSIVE MEDICATION MANAGEMENT WHICH WE DETAIL. IN THAT -- PAPER AS A POTENTIAL SOLUTION AND WE'RE SEEING THAT THERE REALLY IS SOME SOME STRIDES TO COULD BE MADE IF WE IMPROVE THE AVAILABILITY AND SCALE UP. OF THIS MODEL OF I THINK THAT WE'VE THERE'S BEEN OUT SOME OF THE REPORTS ABOUT THE THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THAT PRESCRIBES ARE ABLE TO SPEND. SPA SPEAKING WITH THEIR PATIENTS I THINK THERE'S A REASON ESTIMATE THAT ABOUT TWENTY SIX SECONDS IS SPENT ON DISCUSSING. THE EVIDENCE BASED PORTIONS OF A NEW MEDICATION WITH A PATIENT AND TWENTY SIX SECONDS A LOT TO THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO TALK ABOUT A MEDICATION THEY BE BE ON FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. BUT THAT'S WHAT WE FOUR TIMES LONGER THAN A MINUTE SPEAK TODAY AND SO REALLY THINKING ABOUT WE COULD DO MORE AND THERE IS THE AVAILABILITY OF DOING THIS IS IS AT OUR DISPOSAL WE JUST HAVE TO FIND A BETTER WAY. OF DEPLOYING PHARMACISTS TO MEET THIS OAL WHICH IS BECOMING I THINK MORE MORE PORTENT AS OUR POPULATION AGES AND COST ONLY GO UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DAVID GONZALEZ ON BEHALF OF AMERICA'S FISHING GROUPS HAPPY TO BE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT I THINK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR INTRODUCING THIS MEASURE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US.

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ARE. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'M PLEASED TODAY 2% AB ONE SIX SIX A BIT A BILL TO PILOT THE PROVISION OF MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT FOR PROFESSIONAL VIOLENCE PREVENTION SERVICES. I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND I DID WANT TO THANK THE THE CHERRY COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH US ON ALL THE AMENDMENTS. I ALSO WANTED TO THANK THE DIFFERENCE LAWCENTER FORTY MUHAMMAD WITH THE NATIONAL NETWORK OF HOSPITAL BASED INTERVENTION PROGRAMS AND DOCTOR SHOULDER WITH YOU SHOW A FOR THEIR TECHNICAL SUPPORT ON THE MEASURE. THIS LEGISLATION ADDRESSES THE UNFORTUNATE REALITY THAT FAR TOO MANY VICTIMS AGO OF GUN VIOLENCE ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR RE ENTRY AND RETALIATION. STUDIES HAVE ESTIMATED THAT IN URBAN AREAS OVER 40% OF PATIENTS TREATED FOR VIOLIN INJURY SUCH AS A SHOOTING ARE RE INJURED WITHIN FIVE YEARS. IN RESPONSE TO THESE ALARMING TRENDS PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCHERS IDENTIFIED HOSPITAL VASE VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROGRAMS AS ONE OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE AND EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING RATES OF FINERY ENTRIES. THESE PROGRAMS BRING SPECIALLY TRAINED AND CERTIFIED VIOLENCE PREVENTION SPECIALIST INTO THE HOSPITAL AND A UNIQUE MOMENT OF OPPORTUNITY. TO WORK WITH PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AS HIGH RISK FOR VIOLENT RE INJURY OR RETALIATION. STUDIES HAVE REPEATEDLY DEMONSTRATED THE SUCCESS OF SUCH PROGRAMS YET THESE PROGRAMS ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING IN ONLY A FEW CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL LEADING TO THOUSANDS OF MISSED OPPORTUNITIES EVERY YEAR FOR EFFECTIVE PREVENTION SERVICES TO ADDRESS THE CYCLE OF GUN VIOLENCE IN MANY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES. AB ONE SIX SIX WOULD CREATE A FIVE YEAR PILOT PROJECT THAT WOULD LEVERAGE FEDERAL MEDICAID DOLLARS TO CREATE A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING STREAM FOR THESE PROGRAMS. THE PILOT WAS SUPPORT VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROGRAMS IN OUR STATE'S LARGEST COUNTIES ENSURE A RIGOROUS EVALUATION TO HELP DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND IMPACT OF THESE PROGRAMS. BY EXPANDING UTILIZATION OF THE SERVICES THIS LEGISLATION WOULD SAVE LIVES PROTECT PACKED PAYER RESOURCES REDUCE BURDENS ON THE MEDICAL IN JUDICIAL SYSTEMS AND ADDRESS TROUBLING RACIAL DISPARITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES. THIS BILL OR SEE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE ASSEMBLY AND IS SUPPORTED BY A BROAD COALITION OF MEDICAL AND GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION EXPERTS INCLUDING THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS. THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS COMMITTEE ON TRAUMA AND THE DIFFERENCE LAW CENTER TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION OR DR IAN BROWN A TRAUMA SURGEON AT UC DAVIS AND JOHN TORE AS DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROGRAMS THAT USED TO LIVE IN OAKLAND. WE ALSO OF ARLI FRY LIKE THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS DIRECTOR FROM THE DIFFERENCE LAWCENTER HERE TO HELP ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THANK YOU AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. LIKE TO GO AHEAD. HELLO AS WAS STATED MY NAME'S IN BROWN. THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY -- I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS AN ATTENDING TRAUMA SURGEON FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS HERE AT UC DAVIS I WANTED TO THIS FIELD. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO HELP SOMEONE WHO MIGHT BE HAVING THEIR WORST DAY -- THIS JOB GIVES ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO TURN THAT AROUND TOO MAYBE A SECOND CHANCE AND AND SOMETHING BETTER OUT OF THAT -- IN MY TIME IS TRAUMA SURGEON I'VE OPEN CHESS SOME CLOTHES HOLES IN THE HEART OF PAST DESTROYED LIVERS TAKEN A KIDNEYS AND SPLEEN SAW WITH OF MAKING A DIFFERENCE. BUT ALL TOO OFTEN -- WOULD PERFORM THESE OPERATIONS ONLY TO SEE THE SAME FACES AND AND FAMILIES SHOW UP AGAIN DOWN THE ROAD WITH SIMILAR PROBLEMS. I'VE LEARNED THAT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SAVE A LIFE GETTING OFF TO THE PATIENT OFF THE OPERATING TABLE AND SAFELY THE HOSPITAL DISCHARGES REALLY ONLY THE BEGINNING STEP. IN OTHER MEDICAL SITUATIONS SUCH AS A HEART ATTACK WHEN YOU HAVE AN EVENT LIKE THAT YOUR REST EMERGENCY ROOM YOU'RE STABLE AS AND THEN UPON THIS CHARGE. AN ENTIRE PREVENTION PROGRAMS INITIATING THE PATIENTS GIVEN MEDICATIONS AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION PLAN THAT HELPS YOU. PREVENT YOU FROM COMING BACK TO THE SAME EXACT SITUATION. HISTORICALLY THAT'S NOT BEEN THE CASE WITH VIOLENCE RELATED TRAUMA RETREAT THE UNSHOT WOUND TO THE STAB WOUND TO DISCHARGE A PATIENT ONLY TO THE SAME EXACT. SITUATION THAT BROUGHT THEM THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE SO WE NAY NO CHANGE. AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT THIS RESULS IN A VERY HIGH RATE OF VIOLENT RE INJURY IT'S A REVOLVING DOOR. THE ASSOCIATED COMMUNITY PAINTING LOSSES CANNOT. HAVE A PRICE PUT ON THEM. THE SURGEONS WE CAN PATCH UP JUST DAMAGED ORGANS. BUT THIS IS AGAIN ONLY THE BEGINNING HOSPITAL REYES VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PROGRAMS ARE AN INNOVATIVE STRATEGY AND WAS GONE VIOLENCE IS TREATED AS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. THESE PROGRAMS CONNECT PEOPLE WITH RESOURCES SUCH AS SOCIAL SUPPORT HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE COPING SKILLS PSYCHOSOCIAL PORT. AND LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO NAME A FEW THAT BEING SAID YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE RESOURCES IN THE WORLD AND STILL FAIL IF YOU CAN'T EFFECTIVELY ENGAGE PEOPLE WITH A FOUNDATION OF TRUST RESPECT AND UNDERSTANDING AND THEN SUSTAIN AN ENGAGEMENT. THEREFORE THE CORNERSTONE OF THESE INTERVENTIONS IS THE INTERVENTION SPECIALIST THEY HAVE AN ENORMOUS TASK BEING GAUGING DEVELOPER POOR WITHIN AN INCREDIBLY SMALL WINDOW OF TIME -- THIS REQUIRES CULTURAL COMPETENCY IN A FIRSTHAND UNDERSTANDING OF THE PATIENT'S LIFE EXPERIENCE WHICH CAN NOT BE STATED ENOUGH. SIMPLY PUT KILL PEOPLE HEAL PEOPLE. THEY'VE UNIQUE INSIGHT PERSPECTIVE AND EXPERTISE THAT IS UNMATCHED BY OTHER HOSPITAL PERSONNEL THEY NOT ONLY BRING YOU TO THE WATER HELP YOU UNDERSTAND WHY THEY THEMSELVES TO GOOD DRINK IN THE PAST. NUMEROUS STUDIES CONDUCTED OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS WILL CONFIRM THAT THESE APPROACHES ONCE A STANDARD NOT ONLY EXTREMELY COST EFFECTIVE. BUT SAVE LIVES THE PROPOSED BILL HERE IS PROJECTED TO GENERATE DIRECT COST SAVINGS EVEN IF IT JUST PREVENTS TWENTY SEVEN SHOOTINGS. THIS DOESN'T EVEN BEGIN TO COVER HOW IT WILL CHANGE COMMUNITY DYNAMICS COMMUNITY PERCEPTIONS OF VIOLENCE AND COMMUNITY PERCEPTIONS OF SOCIAL SUPPORT. ON A MORE PERSONAL LEVEL THESE PROGRAMS GIVE ME SOMETHING DIFFERENT OFFER PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS IT DOES CHARGE GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY OFFER REAL HOPE -- SOSUS SURGEONS NURSES IN THE ENTIRE HEALTH CARE STAFF. WE HEAL PHYSICAL WOUNDS BUT ULTIMATELY THESE ARE IN EFFECT BANDAIDS IF WE CAN ADDRESS THE REAL ISSUES. REALLY CHANGING OF AYE FROM HEALING A PERSON FROM VIOLENCE RELATED TRAUMA REQUIRES A CHOICE BY THAT PERSON. WHICH ISN'T BLEW IT UP BY PERSPECTIVE UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORT IN MY EXPERIENCE NO ONE IS BETTER EQUIPPED TO DO THIS WITH EMPATHY AND EFFECTIVENESS THEN OUR INTERVENTION SPECIALIST. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS BILL AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR AB. ONE SIX SIX GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JOHN DORIS AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITH YOU TO LIVE IN OAKLAND. AND I WORKED WITH THE YOUTH ALIVE FOR OVER -- AND THEN THE VANS PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION FIELD FOR ALMOST TWENTY FIVE YEARS -- PRESENT HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF ONE OF OUR PROGRAMS THE CON THE CROSSFIRE PROGRAM. WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST HOSPITAL BASED BOUNCE INTERVENTION PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY. WE CURRENTLY SERVE I'LL INTRODUCE OR WE'VE BEEN SERVING BOUNCE LEE INJURED YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY FOUR COM THE CROSSFIRE STAFF RECEIVES REFERRALS FOR INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT -- VICTIMS FROM ONE OF THE THREE PROBLEMS CENTERS THAT SERVE ALAMEDA COUNTY. OUR PROGRAM AIMS TO RESPOND WITHIN ONE HOUR. AT FOUR BEDSIDE VISIT -- REFERRALS. TYPICALLY OUR WORK BEGINS BY ASSESSING THE PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL SAFETY AND FOR POTENTIAL FOR RETALIATION. IF THE CLIENT IS STABLE WE THEN PROCEED TO ASSESS FOR SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM NEEDS THAT WILL HELP THE CLIENT RECOVER FROM THE PHYSICAL INJURIES AND TRAUMA. WE WILL DRIVE PARTICIPANTS TO MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS LINK THEN RESOURCES SUCH AS MEDICARE OUT AND VICTIM COMPENSATION BOARD. AND OFTEN PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR THINGS SUCH ASFOOD DIAPERS AND CLOTHING. I'LL GIVE YOU A SHORT A BRIEF STUDY ON ONE OF OUR THE INSTANCES THAT WE WERE ABLE TO SUPPORT. IT WAS A DOUBLE SHOOTING -- THE VICTIM WAS A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD FEMALE WITH A GUNSHOT WOUND TO HER STOMACH AND HER THREE YEAR OLD SON WITH A GUNSHOT WOUND TO THE ARM. OF THE PROGRAM WAS ABLE TO SUPPORT HER INITIALLY WITH COMPLETING AND MEDICARE APPLIQUE. THAT IN TURN HELPED HER. RECEIVED OR GET TO SURGERIES TO REPAIR INTESTINES. WE WERE ABLE TO REFER HER TO OUTPATIENT SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT AS WELL AS ENGAGING HER AN ONGOING MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. FOR HER SON WE WERE ABLE TO SUPPORT IN LINKING HIM TO PHYSICAL THERAPY FOR HIS ARM. WHICH WOULD LATER LEARN WITHOUT THERAPY SERVICES -- HIS ARM MAY HAVE BEEN AMPUTATED. AND WE ALSO REFERRED HIM INTO MENTAL HEALTH THERAPY. AND IS REALLY CRITICAL IN THIS CASE BECAUSE THAT ACTUALLY LEAD TO THE PROSECUTION OF THE SUSPECTS THE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCIDENT. SO WHY BONDS INTERVENTION. INITIALLY THIS PATIENT WAS IN FEAR FOR HER LIFE AS WELL AS FOUR SONS. A KEY COMPONENT TO PROVIDING SERVICES BUILDING A STRONG TRUSTING RELATIONSHIP. WE ACCOMPLISH THIS BY HAVING TRAINED. STAFF HIRED FROM COMMUNITIES SIMILAR TO OUR VICTIMIZE CLIENTS AND HAVE THEM WORK WITH THE PARTICIPANTS. THIS IN TURN HELPS. BY APPROACHING FOLKS WITH THE TRAUMA INFORMED APPROACH AND PROVIDING THEM. WITH THE SERVICES THAT PRIORITIZE THEIR HEALTH OUTCOMES AND SAVES LIVES.

LEGALIZING HOME COOKING HAS WIDE SUPPORT ACROSS CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR OVER SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE SIGNED A PETITION THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE CALLED THE ROAD THERE LIKE TO OFFICIALS. AND ALMOST A HUNDRED ORGANIZATION SIGNED ON TO SUPPORT AB. SIX TWO SIX BUT SINCE AB SIXTY SIX WENT INTO EFFECT IN JANUARY WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH INTERESTED COUNTIES ON IMPLEMENTING HOME COOKING PERMITS. THE COUNTIES IN SLOW TO IMPLEMENT BECAUSE OF CONFUSION AROUND ISSUE AROUND SOME ISSUES PRIMARILY OF JURISDICTION. AB THREE SEVEN SEVEN SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND CREATES MORE CLARITY NOT ONLY AROUND JURISDICTION BUT ALSO AND PUBLIC HEALTH REQUIREMENTS PERMITTING INSPECTION PROCESSES AND THIRD PARTY THIRD PARTY PLATFORM ISSUES. THIS BILL REPRESENTS TIRELESS ONGOING COLLABORATION BETWEEN PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS AND HOME COOKING ADVOCATES AND REPRESENTS ALL INTEREST INCLUDING THE C. C. D. H.. SHE ASKED HOW ADVOCACY SACK AS WELL AS THE COMPLIANCE. OTHER THAN A HANDFUL SMALL CITIES WE HAVE ALMOST NO OPPOSITION WE KNOW WE CAN'T FIX THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CITIES AND COUNTIES WITH THE FOOD. COURAGE AND EXPECT CITIES THE PASTORAL ORDINANCES TO ADDRESS ISSUES AS THEY ARISE AND TRUST THEM TO GOVERN THEMSELVES SUCCESSFULLY.

JONATHAN CLAIMS AFTER THE COUNTY SAN DIEGO I KIND OF FALL INTO THAT TWEENER CATEGORY WE'VE SUBMITTED A LETTER OF CONCERNS. NEARLY AROUND THE AREA RELATED -- TO AS THE ONE OF THE SPONSORS Là TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CITIES AND COUNTIES. IN THE COUNTY SAN DIEGO WE HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CITIES BUT WE HAVE CITIES THAT WANT THIS PROGRAM WE HAVE OTHER CITIES THAT DON'T WANT THIS PROGRAM. AND AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED THE COUNTY DOES NOT SEE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW CERTAIN CITIES IN OR OUT WE EITHER OFTEN AND DON'T OFTEN. KNOWN COOPER SPEND PROGRAM AND WE THINK THAT SHOULD BE CHANGED OTHERWISE WE AGREE WITH A LOT OF THE OTHER -- CLEAN UP FROM TO LAST YEAR'S PROPOSALS. MANAGER DAVEY JOHNSON TO HAVE ONE OF THOSE SMALL CITIES THAT DO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL SOUTH PASADENA -- HE HAS -- BEEN VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PREEMPTION AND THE ABILITY OF THE COUNTY TO MAKE THE DECISION FOR ALL ELECTED OFFICIALS AND HAVE THEM HAVE NO SAY IN WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS -- THEY'RE VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH -- QUé A RISK AND THEY THINK THAT THIS DECISION IS RIGHT WE LEFT WITH THE ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE AND HAVING THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES MAKE THE DECISION FOR ALL EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES. WE THINK IS AN OVERREACH WE THINK THERE'S ANOTHER WAY THAT THE COUNTY IF THEY WANTED TO OFTEN THEY CAN OPT IN AND HAVE A DOUBLE LOCKED IN. SO THE COUNTY COULD OPT IN AND SAYING WE'RE GOING TO BE THE HEALTH OFFICER FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES IN THOSE CITIES THAT WANTED TO JOIN THEM AND OPTING IN COULD ALLOW THOSE BUSINESSES IN THOSE LOCATIONS. THAT IS A WAY THAT WOULD WE WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT BILL -- BUT THE BILL'S IS CURRENTLY CRAFTED MAKES THE DECISION TAKES A DECISION ENTIRELY OUT OF ELECTED OFFICIALS DECISION MAKING AND WE ARE VERY MUCH OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- RIGHT SO I WILL -- SO WE'VE TAKEN OPPOSITION ALREADY AND THEN. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- WE ARE CONTINUE TO BE OPEN. TO ANY TECHNICAL -- CHANGES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY GIVE -- LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WORKING WITH COUNTY TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THIS.

RUBIO I THANK YOU THAT BILL HAS THREE VOTES -- WILL PUT THE BILL ON CALL THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. OKAY CENTER HOLDEN WELCOME. AND I THINK -- YOU HAVE TWO ITEMS ONE WHICH IS ON CONSENT SO WHAT THIS WILL HAVE ITEM NUMBER NINE AB. NINE FOURTEEN WELCOME THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL. NINE FOURTEEN THIS BILL SEEKS TO DECREASE RATES OF DEATH AND RECIDIVISM BY IMPROVING ACCESS TO HEALTH SERVICES. UNDER CURRENT LAW PERSONS MEDI CAL BENEFITS OR TERMINATED AFTER WHEN YOU'RE BEING AN INMATE. OF A PUBLIC INSTITUTION LATER WHEN THAT INDIVIDUAL IS ELIGIBLE FOR RELEASE. CDC OUR PROGRAMS HELP THEM REAPPLY FOR MEDI CAL BENEFITS. FOURTEEN A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS BEFORE THE RELEASE DATE. ALTHOUGH THESE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN A ROLLING PEOPLE INTO MEDI CAL. YOU CAN STILL TAKE A WEEKS AFTER RELEASE BEFORE THEY HVE ACCESS TO CARE AND MEDICATIONS. THE SPIRIT IS CRITICAL FOR ALL PEOPLE FACING REINTEGRATION AND IS ESPECIALLY CRITICAL FOR THOSE WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS CHEMICAL DEPENDENCIES OR MENTAL ILLNESSES. pACCESS TO MEDICINE THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE VULNERABLE TO THE CONDITIONS THAT MAY HAVE INITIALLY GOTTEN THEM ARRESTED. IN ADDITION TO AN INCREASE RESERVE RICK RISK OF RECIDIVISM PEOPLE FACING REINTEGRATION PLACE VERY HIGH RATES OF MORTALITY. IN THE TWO WEEKS FOLLOWING RELEASE OF FORMALLY INCARCERATED PERSON IS TWELVE POINT 7% TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE FROM PREVENTABLE CAUSE. DURING THESE CRITICAL TWO WEEKS DURING OVERDOSE OR I'M SORRY DURING THESE TWO WEEKS DRUG OVERDOSE -- VASCULAR DISEASE HOMICIDE AND SUICIDE WERE THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH. AB NINE FOURTEEN WILL SUSPEND MEDI CAL BENEFITS AND REDID TURMAN ELIGIBILITY THROUGH A SIMPLIFIED YEARLY PROCESS FOR INDIVIDUALS UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX THAT BECOME INMATES. OF A PUBLIC INSTITUTION. SUSPENSION WILL ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WHO HAD MEDI CAL BENEFITS BEFORE ENTERING JAIL WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE MEDICAL BENEFITS IMMEDIATELY UPON RELEASE. CONTINUITY OF CARE IS ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAINING POSITIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND PREVENTING COSTLIER FORM. HEALTHCARE DOWN THE ROAD. AB NINE FOURTEEN WILL ENSURE. THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR BENEFITS IMMEDIATELY UPON RELEASE. THUS IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR GOING TO BE POPULATIONS AND IMPROVING RECIDIVISM RATES I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER RIVAL. THANK YOU WITNESSES A SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHEN FLOOR ON BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- TO PUT IT SHORTLY THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE ALREADY SOLVED PEOPLE WHO ARE LARGELY IN CONTROL OF THE STATE AND ROLLING THEM INTO A STATE PROGRAM SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM. BUT WITH SOME OF THE NUANCES OF THE MEDIC HOW PROGRAM ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE HAVE IS NOT ONLY DO THEY NEED TO BE ENROLLED IN MEDICARE OUT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS OR MANAGED CARE PLAN. IN ORDER TO GET SERVICES SO BY SUSPENDING INSTEAD OF TERMINATING AND RE ENROLLING WE STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS. AND THEN I'D ALSO JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT SIXTEEN STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HAVE ALREADY DONE THIS WITHOUT. YOU THIS GUY FALLING IN -- SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN WE HAVE HAD A MUCH SIMPLIFIED DANIEL TO READ TO TERMINATION -- IN MANY COUNTIES UP 240% OF THE POPULATION WHO ARE UNDER SIXTY FIVE ARE ABLE TO RE ENROLL AUTOMATICALLY WHERE THE COUNTY WORKERS JUST LOOKING AT WHAT'S IN THE COUNTY FILE OR DOING THINGS ELECTRONICALLY. THIS POPULATION IS EVEN MORE AMENABLE TO THAT SO THE IDEA THAT WE COULD DO AS SIMPLIFIED ELIGIBILITY READ A TERMINATION FOR THIS POPULATION IS EVEN ALL THE MORE BENEFICIAL AND TO NOT REITERATE EVERYTHING THAT THE AUTHOR JUST. SO WELL STATED YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE LEAVE PRESENT THEIR ABILITY TO SURVIVE ON THE OUTSIDE WHETHER IT'S ACCESS TO HOUSING WHETHER IT'S ACCESS TO FOOD OR ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE REALLY DETERMINES THEIR ABILITY TO RE AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR DRIVE OUT.

TEN THIRTY ONE WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO DEVELOP REGULATIONS FOR A COMPREHENSIVE CONTINUUM OF CARE. FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER FOR YOUTH UNDER AGE. TWENTY ONE AB TEN THIRTY ONE WOULD ALSO ENABLE COUNTIES AND PROVIDERS TO PROPERLY CLAIM AND BILL FOUR EPS D. T. ENTITLEMENT SERVICES UNDER DRUG MEDIC HOW. BY REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT AS BILLING CODES FOR COVERED A SUBSTANCE USED. P. S. D. T. BENEFIT. TOO MANY ACRONYMS KIND OF CREATES IT. IT'S CONFUSION SO MY APOLOGIES. SINCE THERE IS A FEDERAL MATCH WITH THE P. S. T. T. THE ABILITY TO BILL FOR THE SERVICES WOULD DRAW DOWN FEDERAL DOLLARS FOR YOUTH TREATMENT. FOR CONTEXT UP USE DISORDER DEVELOPED A PATTERN OF ALCOHOL OR DRUG DEPENDENCE BEFORE AGE EIGHTEEN UNDER THE FEDERAL A. B.. D. E. P. S. T. T. THANK YOU. BENEFIT MEDICAID AND ROLL YOU ARE ENTITLED TO EACH APPROPRIATE CARE FOR ANY IDENTIFIED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS EVER MEDICAID SERVICE PAYMENTS ALONE ARE INSUFFICIENT FOR THE CAPITAL AND OVERHEAD COSTS NEEDED. TO BUILD NEW COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA HAS NOT CHOSEN TO INVEST IN A ROBUST SYSTEM OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER CARE. FOR UNINSURED AND MEDICAID ELIGIBLE YOUTH WHILE COUNTIES MANAGE PUBLICLY FUNDED TREATMENT PROGRAMS ELECT SYSTEMIC. GUIDANCE AND DEDICATED FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO ESTABLISH A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF SERVICES BUT DISPONIBLE POPULATION.

OKAY THANK YOU WITNESSES ABORT RANDALL MY FLIP A COIN AND RECITED AND I I GOT TO GO FIRST THIS TIME SO HAD TAUGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS TOM RENT FREE WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS. THE I THINK WE'RE ALL AWARE OF THE IMPACT THAT THE CURRENT DRUG CRISIS IS HAVING ON ON YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE LESSONS I MEAN WE'RE HEARING MORE FROM -- EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS THAT THEY'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS ENTERING A R. E. OURS EITHER USING DEPENDENT ON OR ADDICTED TO OPIOIDS OR IN SOME VERY SAD CASES EVEN OVERDOSE. AT THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF YOUTH WITH THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS% ARE MOST EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSED IN AGE SPECIFIC TREATMENT SETTINGS THAT OFFER A CONTINUUM OF CARE. FROM OUT REGION SCREENING THROUGH ASSESSMENT -- DIAGNOSIS TREATMENT -- FAMILY INTERVENTION RECOVERY SUPPORT OF THE THE THE EARLY PERIODIC SCREENING DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT MANDATE EPS THE T. -- UNDER THE FEDERAL LAW IS VERY BROAD AND BASICALLY SAYS THAT MEDICAID ELIGIBLE YOUTH ARE ENTITLED TO WHATEVER SERVICES ARE NEEDED TO AMELIORATE A HEALTH CONDITION INCLUDING -- SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER -- MOST OF IT MOST PUBLICLY FUNDED THERE SHOULD BE. POPULATION AND HAS -- SOME WOMEN THIS ARIAN SAID THE STATE IS NOT REALLY INVESTED IN A CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR YOU WITH WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SO WHAT WE'RE JUST TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BILL. IS BY REQUIRING -- DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO ESTABLISH STANDARDS AND AND REGULATIONS FOR A CONTINUUM OF CARE AND TO ESTABLISH BILLING CODES UNDER EPS D. T. THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES. WE HOPE TO BETTER ABOUT BE ABLE TO SERVE THESE YOUTH WHO ARE WHO ARE IN NEED OF CARE THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN RANDALL HAGER FOR IT -- THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION WE ARE CO SPONSORS OF THIS AND I THAT YOU'VE JUST HEARD SOME VERY EXCELLENT TESTIMONY WON'T -- REPEAT ANY OF THAT I THINK ONE THING THAT STRUCK ME AS I WAS PREPARING FOR THIS HEARING AS I WAS RE READING A HEALTHY KIDS SURVEY OF SCHOOLS. AND THERE'S A VERY STRIKING -- AND RECENT DATA IN THERE ABOUT -- KIDS INVOLVEMENT WITH DRUGS AND ALCOHOL -- BY THE SEVENTH GRADE -- ABOUT 729% OF THE KIDS HAVE ACTUALLY GOT SOME SORT OF SUBSTANCE USE -- INVOLVEMENT. BY THE LEVIN GRADE IN THAT GOES UP 229% AND THAT COULD BE ANYTHING FROM HAVING A SINGLE DRINK WITH A THIRTY DAY PERIOD. TO FIVE DRINKS IN SUCCESSION IN A SINGLE EPISODE IT COULD BE USING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ILLICITLY IT COULD BE A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS. THOSE NUMBERS ARE VERY LARGE NUMBERS THAT'S ONE IN FOURTEEN AT THE SEVENTH GRADE LEVEL SO I THINK IT DOES TELL US THAT WE DO NEED TO GET MOVING AND WE NEED A SYSTEM OF CARE. AND WE WILL WE NEED SOME -- ABILITY TO OFFER -- A REIMBURSEMENT MECHANISM SO THAT PROVIDERS CAN STEP UP AND DEVELOP THE PROGRAMS AND HIRE THE PEOPLE INTO THE WORK THANK YOU.

RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT INTEGRATED TREATMENT PROGRAMS FOR PEOPLE WITH CO OCCURRING -- SUBSTANCE USE A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS EFFECTIVELY PROMOTE RECOVERY INTEGRATED TREATMENT OCCURS WHEN THE SAME CLINICIANS OR TEAM OF CLINICIANS WORKING IN ONE SETTING UP A CAN PROVIDE APPROPRIATE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE INTERVENTIONS. IN A COORDINATED MANNER UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA'S DRUG MEDI CAL AND SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT PROGRAMS REMAIN BIFURCATED UNDER STATE LAW THIS STRUCTURE IN WHICH CLIENTS MUST NAVIGATE TO SYSTEMS AND WORK WITH DIFFERENT CLINICAL TEAMS. CREATES ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS TO INTEGRATED CARING CAN WILL GET -- NEGATIVELY OUT OF IMPACT OUTCOMES AS A RESULT OF PARALLEL PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS CARE PROVIDERS WHO WANT TO PROVIDE COLOCATED INTEGRATED SERVICES MUST NAVIGATE SUBSTANTIAL -- SUBSTANTIAL BARRIERS PUT IN SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES ON DUPLICATED PROCESSES AND RECORD KEEPING QUIET CARE UNFORTUNATELY IS TOO OFTEN SHAPE BY ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS OF EACH DELIVERY SYSTEM RATHER THAN THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL. IN THIS BILL. WE'RE CREATING A FORMAL STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND AS A FIRST STEP AND JUST A FIRST STEP TOWARD IDENTIFYING AND REMOVING ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS.

COUNTY BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS ARE THE EYES AND EARS FOR THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ESTABLISHED TO ADVISE AND ASSIST SUPERVISORS ON ISSUES IN PROGRAMS. WHERE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY RESEARCH AND MONITOR ON THEIR OWN? LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS OF THE VOICE OF THE AS THE COUNTY BILLS MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. HOWEVER I'VE HEARD MANY INSTANCES WHERE THERE ADVISORY ROLE HAS BEEN MARGINALIZED. AND THIS BILL WOULD REVITALIZE THE LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH BOARDS ADVISORY ROLE TO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AND CLARIFY BOARD RESPONSIBILITIES TO HELP IMPROVE SERVICES PROVIDED. AND WOULD BRING A BROADER COMMUNITY IMPACT PERSPECTIVE TO THE LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH BOARD. WITHIN THE ADDED BENEFITS OF INCREASED TRANSPARENCY. FOR AN INPUT BY THE COMMUNITY. AND THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO IMPROVE SERVICES AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESSES IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THE NEED FOR THIS BILL. TOBY EWING HAS JOINED ME TODAY HE CURRENTLY SERVES AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TO THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION.

KERN COUNTY IS IS THAT -- AND THAT HAVING THE AUTHORITY TO REPORT DIRECTLY TO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WOULD BE IMPORTANT. SAN FRANCISCO SAYS THAT NO ONE IS LISTENING TO THE MENTAL HEALTH BOARD. CONTRA COSTA COUNTY SAYS THAT THEY'VE HAD A LOT OF INTERFERENCE FROM THE COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR'S OFFICE AND THEY WANT TO CONTROL THE MESSAGE ON THE AGENDA AND IT WOULD BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. FOR THE BOARD SERMON SOLID INDEPENDENCE. IMPOSTER COUNTY FOLLOWING A CRIMINAL INDICTMENT OF SEVERAL SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES FALLING AND THE ABUSE OF SEVERAL INMATES IN CUSTODY -- THE GRAND JURY CONDUCTED AN INVESTIGATION OF THEIR FINDINGS WERE NOT AGREED UPON BY ALL MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THE SHERIFFS AND HHS DIRECTOR. SO OUR MENTAL HEALTH BOARD CONDUCTED A ONE YEAR DEEPER DIVE INVESTIGATION INTO THE TREATMENT OF MENTALLY ILL AND AT THE AFTER THE REPORT WAS ADOPTED BY OUR MENTAL HEALTH BOARD. COUNTY COUNCIL SO THAT WE IT WAS INVALID WE DIDN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO INVESTIGATE MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN JAIL DESPITE THE LOOKED STATUTE THAT SAYS WERE TO INVESTIGATE SPECIAL PROBLEMS -- SO OUR OUR REPORT WAS EVENTUALLY IT JUST KILLED -- WE HAD AN ATTORNEY ON OUR BOARDS YASSER STATUTE THAT SAID THAT WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO GO INTO THE JAIL AND THE NEXT DAY SHE WAS ASKED TO RESIGN FROM THE BOARD BY -- THE COUNTY EXEC'S OFFICE SO CONSIDERING THAT THE STATE HAS REALIGNED SERVICES TO THE LOCAL LEVEL AND PROVIDING ALL THE OVERSIGHT IS NOW AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE BOARDS HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IS TO ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. CAPTION EMITTED CHAIR MEMBERS W. A. M. THE EXACT ADDRESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVER SEND KIND OF THE COMMISSION. AB THIRTEEN FIFTY TWO AS YOU'VE HEARD IS AN INITIATIVE TO STRENGTHEN THE VOICE OF OUR LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH BOARDS ON THESE BOARDS PREDATE THE KNOW HOW SERVICES ACT BUT THE INTENT IS CAPTURED IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. THE COMMUNITY GAUGE MEN IS KEY TO STRENGTHENING OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED. IN TERMS OF HOW FUNDS ARE USED OR NOT USED. AND THE BOARDS ARE A MECHANISM TO ENSURE THAT THE COMMUNITY DOES HAVE A VOICE IN MINORING WAS HAPPENING IN SUPPORTING WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND THAT THEY ARE ADVISORY TO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WE SEE THIS AS A LIGHT TOUCH BILL THAT REINFORCES THE LANGUAGE IN THE STATUTE CURRENTLY.
