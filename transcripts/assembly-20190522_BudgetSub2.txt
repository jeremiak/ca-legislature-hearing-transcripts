AND IT'S NOT A PERFECT BUDGET BUT I THINK WE MAKE -- SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN OUR BUDGET HERE TODAY WE OF COURSE ADOPT THE THE GOVERNOR'S -- PROPOSAL FOR THE MAY REVISE FOR FUNDING AND ADD A BIT MORE I TWO MAJOR HIGHLIGHTS THAT WE THINK. WILL HELP TREMENDOUSLY THROUGH -- THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WITH A CASH STRAPPED DISTRICTS ARE FURTHER PAYING DOWN. SOME OF OUR LIABILITIES IN PENSION OBLIGATIONS SPECIFICALLY IT AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT FIVE BILLION TO PAY DOWN THE PORTION OF SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. CALPERS PENSION. LIABILITIES ARE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WHICH OF COURSE GETS DISCRETIONARY MONIES TO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS WE WILL HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO MILLION ON TOP OF THE GOVERNOR'S NAY REVISED AMOUNT THAT'LL FURTHER HELP. OUR SCHOOLS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AND THEN WILL ALSO MAKE SURE WE ADDRESS THE SPECIAL AT ISSUE WHICH I KNOW MISTER MEDINA O'DONNELL ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE SECOND. WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S NEARLY SIX HUNDRED MILLION ONGOING FUNDING TO ADDRESS SPECIAL LEAD -- WE HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ALLOCATION OF THOSE MONIES FOCUSING ON ABOUT HALF THEIR EQUALIZATION WHICH I THINK IS A FAIR WAY TO HELP DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE. AS WELL AS SUPPORT THIS SPECIAL LEAD -- EARLY EDUCATION PRESCHOOL PROPOSAL. WE ALSO PROVIDE FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME AND FUNDING. FOR THE LOW PERFORMING STUDENT BLOCK GRANT -- A SLIGHT TWEAK OF THE LC IF THAT PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE WE'RE HELPING ALL CALIFORNIA KIDS IN OUR IN OUR GREAT STATE SO OVERALL -- YOU KNOW THIS IS A POSITIVE INVESTMENT -- THEN. ABOUT TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW MONEY FOR OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS ACROSS CALIFORNIA BUT CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH EVEN AFTER THIS BUDGET WILL STILL BE. IN THE FORTIES AND PER PEOPLE FUNDING. AND WE CERTAINLY HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO SO WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN. PLOW MORE RESOURCES INTO OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA -- SO WITH THAT -- DO WE HAVE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MR MEDINA. THANK YOU WHEN A THANK ARE ARE CHAIR -- FOR THE FIFTY TWO HOURS THAT WE PUT IN. ON THE BUDGET FOR EDUCATION. AND AS HE INDICATED. I AM WEARING RED FOR ED. TODAY. AT AS OUR THOUSANDS OF TEACHERS ACROSS -- CALIFORNIA WHO ARE HERE -- AT THE CAPITOL TODAY. AND I AM PROUD TO HAVE BEEN. A TEACHER IN THE CLASSROOM TEACHER FOR THIRTY FOUR YEARS -- IN RIVERSIDE MY DISTRICT AND AND AGREE WITH OUR CHAIR THAT THIS IS NOT A PERFECT BUDGET -- AND ALO AGREE WITH WITH THE MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE A MISTER MURATSUCHI HERE -- WHO IS POINTED OUT THAT BEING FORTY FIRST I BELIEVE IN THE NATION -- IS NOT WHERE WE WANT TO BE -- I I WAS A VERY -- PROUD TO HAVE BEEN -- IN LA ON A RAINY DAY WITH THE LA UNIFIED TEACHERS WHEN THEY WALKED OUT. WHEN THEY WENT ON STRIKE FOR A FOR MORE FUNDING -- EN LA FOR MORE LIBRARY AIDS MORE LIBRARIANS MORE MENTAL HEALTH WE'RE COUNSELORS. AND WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE WITH THE OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT THAT THEY GOT IN LOS ANGELES. OF THE PARENTS THAT WERE THERE -- SUPPORTING TEACHERS STUDENTS WHO WERE THERE SUPPORTING THEIR TEACHERS ALL SAYING THAT WE NEED TO DO. MORE AND BETTER FOR EDUCATION FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION -- IN CALIFORNIA. ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE BUDGET DOES NOT INCLUDE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. OF ON GOING -- PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING FOR SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR STUDENTS WITH SEVERE DISABILITIES WOULD HAVE BEEN A TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. A YEAR -- OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD AND THAT IS NOT INCLUDED SO I I HOPE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES. TO DO BETTER. TO DO BETTER FOR STUDENTS -- OWNED IN CALIFORNIA WHO DESERVE THE SAME -- TOP NOTCH EDUCATION THAT I THINK WE HAD WHEN I I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL -- IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MISTER O'DONNELL INVESTMENT MEDINA. THANK YOU -- THERE ARE -- CLEARLY. BOB SIZE AND DOWNSIZE. TO ANY BUDGET ARM. ON THE UPSIDE I YOU'RE CERTAINLY. APPRECIATE HOW -- THE GOVERNOR TO BEGIN AND JANUARY RECOGNIZED AND AND HEARD THE US SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- BIGGEST CONCERNS ABOUT THE THE BIGGEST COST DRIVERS THAT WERE CHALLENGING DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- AND THAT. WOULD BE PENSIONS AND SPECIAL EDUCATION. AND SO. WHEN I? STEP BACK AT WHAT. TO OUR BUDGET IS LOOKING LIKE AT THIS POINT -- ALTHOUGH I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THE THAT THE GOVERNOR WAS NOT PROPOSING. A PLAN -- FOR GETTING CALIFORNIA. FROM THE BOTTOM TEN IN THE NATION IN PER PUPIL SPENDING -- TO GET US TO THE TOP. OUR LEAST CLOSER TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. I I DID WRITE. APPROVED ESPECIALLY APPRECIATE THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND NON PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND DOLLARS THAT HE'S ALLOCATING TO GIVE PENSION RELIEF TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHICH YOU KNOW. CLEARLY ARE BECOMING A BIGGER AND BIGGER CHALLENGE. OF FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- I'M HOPING THAT. TO THESE DOLLARS I AM HEARING FROM MY LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT THESE DOLLARS WILL DEFINITELY. GIVE THEM RELIEF -- TO TO PROVIDE MORE FLEXIBILITY TO TO SPEND MORE DOLLARS IN THE CLASSROOM -- WITH THE DOLLARS THAT WOULD BE FREED UP FROM -- THOSE THAT OTHERWISE WOULD BE ALLOCATED -- TO TO THE THE PENSION COSTS -- I ALSO -- VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE ASSEMBLY VERSION OF THE THE BUDGET. THAT IS REJECTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON SPECIAL EDUCATION AND TO FOCUS ON THE SPECIAL EDUCATION CONCENTRATION GRANTS. AND TO INSTEAD FOCUS THE DOLLARS ON EQUALIZING SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING RATES -- I I BELIEVE THIS IS A A FAIR WAY THAT WOULD BENEFIT MORE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- AND FINALLY -- IT'S CHAIR I APPRECIATE TO THE THE INCLUSION OF THE ELSE FF TARGET FUNDING -- GOALS -- THE THAT WE HAVE IN OUR VERSION OF THE BUDGET -- SO THAT JUST SAYS AS WE DID IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN WE HAD A PLAN. ON HOW -- TO GET TO OUR END GOAL -- BETTER ACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN OR AND GOAL WAS TO RESTORE ALL OF THE K. THROUGH -- TWELVE BUT THE BUDGET CUTS THAT -- THAT WE SUFFER DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. NOW WE SHOULD -- EXPIRED -- TO YOU KNOW GET ARCHY ARE. PEOPLE K. THROUGH TWELVE FUNDING -- BACK TO WHERE WE USED TO BE OR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE -- IN THE TOP TEN IN THE NATION AND I I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE.

BECAUSE A LOT OF THIS HAPPENS OUTSIDE OF THIS HEARING AND I REALIZE THAT SO I WANT TO THANK THEM BOTH -- OF FOR THEIR THEIR HELP ON THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR -- AND I WAS MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS I TO SHARE MY COLLEAGUES CONCERNS THAT WE'RE TREATING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MORE OF A MORE OF A FLOOR THEN. IT MORE AND MORE AS A CEILING AND FLOOR. AND I THINK WHAT AT LEAST AT A MINIMUM I THINK WE'VE STARTED MISTER MURATSUCHI IF I MAY UM WE START OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS ASSURING KNOWLEDGE INSIDE THIS HEARING WHEN PEOPLE COME UP. AND THEY PAT THEMSELVES ON THE BACK IS A WHILE WE FILL PROP. NINETY EIGHT AND THEY WALK AWAY BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH. THAT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR STILL ON THE BOTTOM -- TEN ACROSS THE THE COUNTRY -- JUST ANOTHER COUPLE COMMON SPECIAL ED I WISH THAT WE DO MORE FOR EQUALIZATION THAN WE ARE RIGHT NOW. I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE FROM -- RIVERSIDE IS AN ARDENT SUPPORTER OF THAT -- AND ALSO THERE'S A COMPONENT HERE WE'RE ACCEPTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO SELL ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN. IN -- IN -- IN PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE BOND FUNDS AND THEY WERE YOU MY OPINION THAT WE SHOULD REALLY TAKE THAT A CONFERENCE THAT WOULD BE MY PREFERENCE I KNOW WE'RE NOT DOING THAT TODAY BUT WE MY PREFERENCE AT THAT GOES TO CONFERENCE. SO THAT WE CAN GET MORE BOAT BOND SOLD AND WE CAN GET MORE -- SCHOOLS MODERNIZED BUILT INVEST IN OUR KIDS WITH THAT I TURN IT BACK TO YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. MR O'DONNELL WITH WHAT WE DID -- LOOK AT THAT ISSUE AND WE'RE IN FULL AGREEMENT THAT THE VOTERS VOTED FOR THAT. THAT BOND MEASURE AND WHAT THE MONEY SPENT. TO MODERNIZE AND AND BUILD CLASSROOMS ACROSS CALIFORNIA WE DIDN'T QUITE. BUDGET THE DEBT SERVICE FOR THAT ACCORDINGLY SO THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THAT STILL AND CONFERENCE EVERYTHING'S ALWAYS ON THE TABLE. HI I DIDN'T GO OVER AND THIS IS THE WHOLE PROP NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE HERE TODAY. TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PAY SOME HIS CAR KIND OF BRIEFLY OUTLINED SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THAT AS WELL IF IF INDIVIDUALS WANT -- TO PIPE IN OR HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THAT BEFORE TAKE THE VOTE SO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE -- PROP NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE HE IS A BIT MORE AS A SAID FROM THE OUTSET THEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET.

AND ALSO GET MORE STUDENTS IN THE COMMUNICANTS SYSTEM TO FILL THE JOBS OF TODAY. AND TOMORROW AS FAR AS THAT THE THE FORMULA -- THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA FOR FOR OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- IN SOME IT'S IT'S A BIG MESS RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE THE TIME -- NOR THE ANSWERS TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION TODAY WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE INTERIM HE IS -- LOCKING IN THEIR PERFORMANCE FUNDING AT 10%. AND URGING ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN THE CHANCES OFFICE AND ADMINISTRATION TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE FORMULA BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE PROBABLY TEN OR FIFTEEN DIFFERENT IDEAS OF PROPOSALS HOW TO ADDRESS THIS AND THAT DOESN'T GIVE US -- YOU KNOW FRANKLY A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES TO DO SO AT THIS POINT TIME WE KNOW THERE'S THERE'S BAD DATA DISAGREEMENTS OVER THE DEFINITIONS. AND OF COURSE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER DOZENS OF RECOMMENDATION SO.
