I WANT TO PARTICULARLY THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SENATOR STERN. CENTER BOARD JUST FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND SENATE CORTESE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION AS WELL- ISSUES WE LOOK TO TACKLE AND BETTER UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR SOME TIME AND GROWN. EXPONENTIALLY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. THIS EXPLAINS WHY SO MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE INTRODUCED. BILLS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE FACING- LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS THE PROMINENCE GROWING PROMINENCE INFLUENCE OF SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. IN ATTENDANCE SOCIAL ILLS SUCH AS PROLIFERATION OF MISINFORMATION. FOREIGN INTERFERENCE IN A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS SILTATION OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. NONCONSENSUAL **** AND THE FOSTERING OF HATE SPEECH AND VIOLENT RADICALIZATION. I SHARE SOME OF THESE CONCERNS AND BELIEVE THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE HOWEVER. I'M SURE THAT MANY FOLKS BE NAY WILL MAKE CLEAR. NEITHER IDENTIFIED NOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM IS SIMPLE AT ALL EVEN COMING TO THE DEFINITION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A QUOTE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM AND QUOTE CAN BE COMPLEX. TODAY'S HEARING IS INTENDED TO MAKE US A LITTLE MORE FLUENT. IN AWARE OF BOTH THE TECHNOLOGY AND LANGUAGE THE LANGUAGE NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WHAT SPACE CAN THE STATE OPERATE IN THIS FEDERAL LAW. THOSE FIRST AMENDMENT CONSTITUTION- THE STATE CERTAINLY HAS A ROLE- AND ONE OF THE THINGS WILL EXPLORE IS WHAT THAT ROLE CAN BE IMPRACTICAL IN LEGAL TERMS- WE HAVE TO FIRST UNDERSTAND HOW THE MECHANICS THESE PLATFORMS WORK. HOW THEY'RE USED TO- POTENTIALLY INFLICT INTENTIONAL AND UNINTENTIONAL HARMS AND HOW PLATFORMS THEMSELVES MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROBLEM. WE HAVE A PANEL OF EXPERTS THE DETAILS EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THESE PLATFORMS FROM HARASSMENT THE FOREIGN INTERFERENCE TO MEDICAL MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION AND WHO MAY BE RESPONSIBLE. THIS WILL HELP US TO GRASP THE ISSUES AND HELP TO FORM POLICY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. WE'RE GONNA HEAR ALSO FROM LEGAL SCHOLARS AS I MENTIONED THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THE SPACE WHICH IN WITH WHICH IN WHICH WE CAN OPERATE- THAT WILL EXPLAIN THE RELEVANT EXISTING LEGAL FRAMEWORKS SECTION TWO THIRTY MANY OF HERD ALL. OF THE COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT'S STEALS THE CENTER OF MANY OF THESE CONVERSATIONS. IT PROVIDES SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IMMUNITY FROM CIVIL OR CRIMINAL LIABILITY. THE CARD BEING KURD BY USER STATEMENTS WHILE EXPLICITLY AUTHORIZING PLATFORMS TO ENGAGE IN THEIR OWN CONTENT MODERATION. WITHOUT RISKING THAT IMMUNITY. ARE THERE FOR UNDERSTANDING THE LAW IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL TO HOW WE CAN. ADDRESS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE BEFORE US CONCERNING SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND THEIR CONTENT- WHAT CAN AND SHOULD BE DONE AT THE STATE LEVEL. GIVEN THE PREEMPTIVE EFFECTIVE FEDERAL LAW IT IS A QUESTION THAT WILL BE EXPLORING. OUR FINAL PANEL THEY WILL SCHEDULE WHAT IS ALREADY BEING DONE TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THE PANELISTS WILL ADDRESS- BEST PRACTICES OF THE INDUSTRY WERE MISTAKES HAVE BEEN MADE. A NUMBER OF INDUSTRY FOLKS HAVE OF PROVIDED INFORMATION TO US ABOUT WHAT IS BEING DONE WHAT CAN BE DONE MOST IMPORTANT FOR OUR CONSIDERATION- WE'VE INVITED- MOST OF THE MAJOR PLATFORMS MEDIA PLATFORM SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO JOIN US TODAY- NONE OF TAKEN UP THE OFFER BUT WE WILL HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE INTERNET ASSOCIATION SPEAK ON BEHALF. OF THE PLATFORMS. WELL BEFORE WE OF ALLOW THE PANELISTS TO BEGIN I'M GOING TO- PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE WHO JOIN US TODAY- TO MAKE STATEMENTS IF THEY SHOULD SO CHOOSE- SO LET ME BEGIN ANYONE WISH TO MAKE A STATEMENT. THE SENATE CORTESE SUBSIDY CORTESE RECOGNIZED. THANK THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I JUST WANT TO- THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER FIRST OF ALL- THE ONE BILL IN PARTICULAR SB FOUR THIRTY FIVE THAT. I THINK WILL BENEFIT FROM THE INFORMATION THAT WE HEAR TODAY AND THEN PERHAPS A QUESTION AND ANSWERS THAT THE RESULT FROM INTO THE PRESENTATION SO- I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE WE WOULD CAN BE IN A GATHERED THIS INFORMATION WITHOUT THE CHAIR POINTS TOGETHER AND OBVIOUSLY. I HAD THE BENEFIT OF- BEING DESIGNATED TO PARTICIPATE ON THE COMMITTEE FOR TODAY- AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT AS WELL. BUT WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR PRESENCE PARTICIPATION AND YOUR INPUT- SEVEN BORDERS WHICH TO MAKE A COMMENT. I DO WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU CHAIR- FOR PUTTING THIS HEARING ON I KNOW THESE INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS ARE A BIT OF A CHALLENGE ESPECIALLY IS. OUR OFFICES ARE BEING RELOCATED TO ANOTHER. FACILITY I HAVE A- KEEN INTEREST IN THE SOCIAL MEDIA SPACE. ONE THING IN PARTICULAR I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL TODAY BUT CERTAINLY HOPE IN THE FUTURE. IS ARE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE POLITICAL. SPEECH OBLIGATIONS OF DISCLOSURE THAT WE SEE AS CANDIDATES OR AS OFFICE HOLDERS. WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY- TO FOLKS THAT READ MATERIAL THAT WE PUT OUT OR LISTEN ON THROUGH. VARIOUS OUTLETS- THE IN THAT THE ENTITY THAT IS PAYING FOR THIS PARTICULAR MESSAGE SO I THINK FROM THE SOCIAL MEDIA STANDPOINT HAVING TO BE PARTICULARLY HELPFUL IS FROM MY STANDPOINT- TO EXPLORE AREAS THAT WOULD FACILITATE FACILITATE EVEN MORE. DISCLOSURES BY INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PROFESSIONALS IN THIS SPACE AND MAKING CERTAIN THAT AN AUDIENCE WITH ME ON FACEBOOK OR ANY OTHER SOCIAL OUTLET UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE BEING GIVEN INFORMATION. ALL BY INDIVIDUALS MOTIVATED WITH PROFIT THING THAT'S PERFECTLY HEALTHY THANK YOU. I THANK YOU CENTER BARGES OF SENT A STERN. BURKE THANK YOU MISTER OUT HOW ALTHOUGH BROWN THINGS OUT VERY BRIEFLY HERE I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE PANELISTS AND THE EXPERTISE THAT YOU MARSHALL HERE TO A SPECIAL THANKS TO YOUR STAFF IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER THEY'VE DONE HERE- RIGHT. I THINK OF. SOCIAL MEDIA. LIKE ANY GREAT INNOVATION IN SOCIETY- TAKE FOR INSTANCE THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE- USEFUL TOOL AND IT'S ALLOWED US TO GET OURSELVES OUT OF- PREINDUSTRIAL TIMES AND GET OURSELVES AROUND AND- EXPANDED THE ECONOMY AND GIVEN US. ACCESS TO NEW MARKETS AND NEW LIVES BUT ALSO HAS SOCIAL EXTERNALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH IT- POLLUTION IS BEING CAUSED OVER MANY YEARS AND WE'VE COME UP WITH ANSWERS TO HOW TO HAVE USEFUL TOOLS THAT STILL HAVE SORT OF A FULL CYCLE APPROACH TO THE PRODUCT THEY'RE PUTTING OUT THERE AND I THINK. THE SOCIAL BENEFITS OF THESE PLATFORMS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT- WERE INITIALLY QUITE OBVIOUS TO ME AS A FRESHMAN AND I GUESS A SOPHOMORE IN COLLEGE WHEN WEEK WHEN FACEBOOK WAS JUST A BOOK- AND THEN IT BECAME A LITTLE MORE THAN JUST A BOOK- WE CIRCLE PICTURES OF PEOPLE'S FACES IN THE BOOK VERSION AND THEN WE PUT PICTURES ONLINE OF PEOPLE AND THEN- HERE WE ARE TODAY WHERE THAT LITTLE OPERATION IS NOW A GLOBAL FORCE TO HAVING SIR TO WITNESS THE BUDDING OF A VERY SMALL THE TIME BUT VERY BIG IDEA. WITH MAJOR IMPLICATIONS BUT ALSO IN A HELPFUL FOR CONNECTING PEOPLE WHAT- WHAT ARE WE DOING TO COMPREHENSIVELY LOOK AT. HOW THESE PLATFORMS ARE IMPACTING SOCIETY AND ARE WE BEING THOROUGH IN THE STANDARDS WE USE TO EVALUATE- THOSE EXTERNALITIES AND ARE THERE AREAS WHERE. SIMPLY DEFIES QUANTIFICATION BUT- NEVERTHELESS BEARS- BEARS RESPONSIBILITY ON THE PLATFORMS THEMSELVES AS OPPOSED TO JUST THE USER SO I'M HOPING WE CAN GET INTO SOME OF THOSE DETAILS ALONG WITH THE- CONVERSATION FEDERALLY ABOUT TWO THIRTY REFORM AND WHERE THE STATE FITS INTO THAT- BUT WE'RE MOVING PAST PRIVACY I THINK HERE INTO SOMETHING. THAT'S MUCH LESS SO ABOUT- WHAT WE DO TO- PREVENT PEOPLE FROM- INADVERTENTLY DISCLOSING THINGS THEY DON'T WANT TO DISCLOSE TO THE FREE MARKET OF WHERE THEY ACTUALLY DO WANT TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION AND WHAT EFFECT THAT HAS- SO THANKS TO LOOK AT FORTY TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN- AND SENT A COUPLE YEAR OLD THANK YOU SENATE CAREER FOR BEING HERE I KNOW THIS IS A CHALLENGE WE WE'RE CURRENTLY- IN- INTERIM. RECESS OF SORTS NOT. NOT REALLY RECESS BUT WE'RE WORKING IN OUR DISTRICTS I APPRECIATE. ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE SENATE COVER YOUR WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS. OR JUST WANT TO CHANGE THANK THE CHAIR FOR- SCHEDULING THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO. TAKE A DEEP DIV. SOME OF THE STUFF IS COMPLICATED AND- AS WE LOOK AT NEW TECHNOLOGY AND THE OPPORTUNITIES WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW WE PROTECT PEOPLE SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART OF THIS TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE JUST A HEADS UP TO THOSE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WISH TO COMMENT. WE'RE GOING TO- HAVE A PUBLIC COMMENT AFTER THE PANELSHAVE PRESENTED THEIR TESTIMONY AND AFTER MEMBERS OF THE SENATE. AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT AND QUESTION THOSE PANELISTS- SO WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN- WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH OUR FIRST PRESENTER. JOHN DR JOHN DONOVAN. IS THE RESEARCH DIRECTOR OF THE SHORENSTEIN CENTER ON MEDIA POLITICS AND PUBLIC POLICY AT THE HARVARD KENNEDY SCHOOL. SHE IS ALSO DIRECTOR OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL CHANGE PROJECTS. SHE'S HERE GIVE US UP. BASICALLY EDITORIAL ON MECHANICS OF SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS DR DONOVAN I HOPE YOUR PRESENT. AND HERE. OKAY YES WE CAN HEAR YOU QUITE WELL THANK HER DOCTOR DONOVAN FOR BEING HERE. I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FIRST AND FOREMOST FOR HAVING ME R. AND- THIS IS A BIT OF AN UNCONVENTIONAL PRESENTATION THE MECHANICS OF SOCIAL MEDIA I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF THE HISTORY OF THE DESIGN AND SOME OF THESE PLATFORMS. AND KIND OF TALK ABOUT WHAT THEIR- ACTUAL CUSTOMERS ARE WHICH ARE ADVERTISERS AND THEN TALK A BIT ABOUT THE PROBLEM OF. HOW USERS GET SUCKED INTO RABBIT HOLES ON OUR ACROSS DIFFERENT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. SO I'M GONNA TRY TO DO ALL OF THIS WITHIN ABOUT SIX MINUTES SAUCY HOW IT GOES- BEFORE THERE WAS MOVE FAST AND BREAK THINGS THERE WAS ANOTHER ANIMATING TACTIC FOR THE TECH INDUSTRY. WAS GET BIG FAST IT'S PHILOSOPHY IS GROUP BE GOOD FOR THE INDUSTRY BUT BAD FOR THE WORLD. OVER THE LAST DECADE SOCIAL NETWORKING THAT IS CONNECTING PEOPLE TO PEOPLE MORE INTO SOCIAL MEDIA WHICH IS CONNECTING PEOPLE TO PEOPLE. AND TO CONTENT. WHICH RESULTED. IN AN EXPONENTIAL PROFITS AND GROWTH. I DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SO NETWORK AND SOCIAL MEDIA BUT THIS TRANSITION WAS SCHEME TO PRODUCTS LIKE FACEBOOK TWITTER AND YOUTUBE DOMINATING GLOBAL MARKETS AND MASS COMMUNICATION. IN SHORT NETWORK SO THE WEALTH OF SOCIETY NETWORKS ARE WHERE THE RICH AND POWERFUL DERIVE THEIR IMPORTANCE AND HIGH STATUS. I'M SAYING HERE SHE IS CONNECTED WHEN REFERENCING SOMEONE YOU DON'T KNOW OR DON'T WANT TO MESS WITH YOU MIGHT EVEN SAY THAT PERSON IS CONNECTED WHEN SOCIAL MEDIA IS THE VECTOR OF ATTACK AGAINST OUR DEMOCRACY IN PUBLIC HEALTH. A SMALL GROUP OF HIGHLY MOTIVATED AND CONNECTED ACTORS CAN MANIPULATE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF ANY ISSUES SIMPLY BY USING THE SOCIAL MEDIA PRODUCTS AS THEY ARE DESIGNED THAT IS THEY DON'T NEED TO. DO ANY- HIGH STAKES HACKING THEY DON'T NEED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES TO- CREATE A VERY POLARIZING- PUBLIC CONVERSATION. HOW SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES GOT BIG BASS WITH A COMBINATION OF LACKS CONSUMER REGULATION ISSUING RISKS BUYING OUT THE COMPETITION WHERE POSSIBLE AND A FOCUS ON SCALE THAT MADE VERY POOR SECURITY DECISIONS. BEYOND CONNECTING PEOPLE AND CONTENT PRODUCTS LIKE FACEBOOK YOUTUBE AND TWITTER RELY ON OTHER COMPANIES AND INDIVIDUALS TO BROUGHT PROVIDE THEM WITH MORE DATA. THAT IS INCREASING THE SCALE IN THIS MASSIVE AND SPRAWLING DATA INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS THE WEB. MAPPING TRACKING AND AGGREGATING PEOPLE SOCIAL NETWORKS NEED SOCIAL MEDIA A VIABLE BUSINESS BECAUSE COMPANIES COULD SELL DATA DERIVED FROM INTERACTIONS. OR THEY COULD NOT MONETIZE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AS OTHER PRODUCTS SUCH AS ADVERTISING TARGETED POST PROMOTED MESSAGES CAME ONLINE. SOCIAL MEDIA DATA SHOULD LEGALLY BE DEFINED AT SOME POINT BUT FOR NOW I'M REFERRING TO INFORMATION ABOUT PEOPLE HOW THEY BEHAVE ONLINE INTERACTIONS WITH PEOPLE AND CONTENT AND LOCATION TACTIC. BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH JUST TO COLLECT DATA AND SORT DATA ON THESE PRODUCTS TARGETED ADVERTISING AND DATA SERVICES ONLY BECAME USEFUL WHEN PAIRED WITH OTHER KINDS OF DATA. FOR EXAMPLE IN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWELVE WHEN LOOKING AT DIFFERENT MODELS FROM MONETIZING FACEBOOK ZUCKERBERG WROTE IN A COMPANY EMAIL THAT ALLOWING DEVELOPERS ACCESS TO DATA WITHOUT HAVING THESE COMPANIES SHARE THEIR DATA WITH FACEBOOK WOULD BE QUOTE GOOD FOR THE WORLD BUT BAD FOR US END QUOTE. THIS IS BECAUSE FACEBOOK KNEW EVEN BACK THEN THAT THEIR PRODUCTS COULD THREATEN PRIVACY ON A SCALE SOCIETY HAS NEVER RECKONED WITH BEFORE NOW THE SOCIAL MEDIA PRODUCTS THAT FAVOUR RUN AWAY SCALE AND OPENNESS THREATEN NOT ONLY OUR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS BUT ALSO THE FUTURE OF DEMOCRACY AND PUBLIC HEALTH. BY LEVERAGING PEOPLE'S NETWORKS AND CONTENT AT THE SAME TIME A BUSINESS MODEL EMERGED FOR KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS INCLUDED. ONE GROCERY DAILY AND MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS CHU INCREASING ENGAGEMENT METRICS AND FREE ADVERTISING REVENUE. ALLOW DECADE BEEN MARKED BY THESE COMPANIES EXPANDING EXPONENTIALLY ALL OF THESE INDICATORS. IN PC MAGAZINE FROM TWENTY ELEVEN ABOUT THE BEST MOBILE APPS. FACEBOOK AND TWITTER WERE BOTH RANKED LOWER THAN A APP THAT TURNS YOUR CAMERA INTO A FLASHLIGHT. IN TWENTY ELEVEN TWITTER AT APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED MILLION USERS FACEBOOK HAD EIGHTY. EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION AND EUGENE HAD ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND USERS BY TWENTY TWENTY RIVER TWITTER HAS REPORTED THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE MILLION USERS FACEBOOK HAS REPORTED TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION ACTIVE USERS. AND THERE'S TWO POINT TWO NINE BILLION FOR YOU TO ADVERTISING REVENUE CONTINUED TO GROW ACROSS ALL OF THESE PRODUCTS WERE GLOBAL I WAS MAKING APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX BILLION AND FACEBOOK IS MAKING APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY FOUR BILLION. I IN ADVERTISING REVENUE AND THESE TWO COMPANIES DOMINATE MOST OF THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY ONLINE AND AS A RESULT THEIR PRODUCTS REALLY DO YOU FAVOR ADVERTISERS. OVER USER SINCE I CANNOT QUITE A BIT OF EXTRA DATA IN ORDER TO- MAKE THEIR PRODUCTS- MORE INTERESTING AND VIABLE FOR ADVERTISERS. USING ACCOUNTS IS A KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATOR DROVE A SHADOW INDUSTRY OF GROWTH HACKING WHICH WAS EVENTUALLY INTEGRATED DIRECTLY INTO THE PRODUCTS ALLOWING A MASSIVE ANY KNOWN VULNERABILITY OF SOCK PUPPETS THAT IS BIG ACCOUNTS 2% FOR THOSE WHO UNDERSTOOD HOW TO MANIPULATETHIS VULNERABILITY INCREASING ENGAGEMENT. DELIVERING MORE NOVEL AN OUTRAGEOUS CONTENT WHICH IS WHY FALSE NEWS HARASSMENT GET DEFAMATION. THRIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES DECISIONS ABOUT PROFIT DRIVE INNOVATION NOT HIGHER PRINCIPLES LIKE ACCESS TO TRUTH JUSTICE OR DEMOCRACY. AS A RESULT THESE PRODUCTS ARE NOT ONLY A PARASITE ON OUR SOCIAL NETWORKS FEEDING OFF EVERY CLICK LIKE AND SHARE BUT THEY ALSO CANNOT OPTIMIZE FOR THE PUBLIC INTEREST. EIGHT AND IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY BACK IN TWENTY ELEVEN MOBILE IS DEVELOPING QUICKLY AND THERE ARE MANY WAYS IN WHICH SOCIAL MEDIA COULD HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO FOSTER COMMUNITY SAFETY. AND TO MAXIMIZE PRIVACY INSTEAD THE DRIVE TO MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF USERS ENGAGEMENT AND READ AND READ THAT NOW HAS LED US HERE. MOST CRUCIALLY THE ENTIRE INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AN OVERHAUL SO THAT COMPANIES ARE NOT ABLE TO SIPHON DATA AND LEVERAGE IT TO MAXIMIZE NEED MANSIONS OVER CONSUMERS. BUT USERS ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE CUSTOMERS ADVERTISERS ARE STRUCTURE OF ONLINE ADVERTISING QUITE PLAIN SYSTEMATICALLY ADVANTAGES THESE COMPANIES AT THE EXPENSE OF SEVERAL OTHER INDUSTRIES MOST IMPORTANTLY JOURNALISM. BY BECOMING THE GATEWAY TO MU MU'S AUDIENCES TOP SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES FOR ADVERTISING REVENUE THAT BELONGS TO THOSE WHO CREATE ENGAGING CONTENT FOR DISPLAY ON THEIR PRODUCTS. MOST NOTABLY JOURNALISTS. WHEN CHRIS ABOUT THE SCHOOL THEIR PREY OF ON YOUR- FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE WHERE SITE THEIR VARIOUS MUSICIANS THESE INITIATIVES PICK AND CHOOSE PARTNERS AND THEN CHANNEL JOURNALIST LABOR DIRECTLY BACK INTO THEIR OWN PRODUCTS. FACEBOOK'S FACT CHECKING PROGRAM FOR INSTANCE PARTNERS WITH SEVERAL REPUTABLE NEWS OUTLETS. BUT LABELING HAS DONE LITTLE TO DIS INCENTIVIZE FAKE NAILS MOREOVER FACT CHECKING IS AN ADHOC- MEASURE AND WILL NEVER RIVAL SUPPORTING INDEPENDENT. INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM A BEDROCK OF THE STRONG DEMOCRACY INSTEAD THIS INITIATIVE EXPANDS FACEBOOK'S EVER GROWING WEB OF INFLUENCE OVER HERE AS IT BECOMES INCREASINGLY MORE DIFFICULT TO CRITICIZE THE CORPORATION FOR FEAR OF LOSING. RESOURCES NEVERTHELESS IS JOURNALISM WAYNE'S SOCIAL MEDIA SERVICE MISINFORMATION AT SCALE TO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DAILY ACTIVE USERS INSTANTANEOUSLY ESPECIALLY ODIOUS WHEN MISINFORMATION IS PROMOTED IN TRENDS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. IN OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY I TESTIFIED ABOUT CONSPIRACY AS MISINFORMATION HAVING SIMILAR ARTICLE SOCIETY SOCIETAL IMPACTS AND SECONDHAND SMOKE. POST TWENTY TWENTY WE SEE MISINFORMATION AT SCALES DEADLY EFFECTS IN THE U. S. AS WELL SCAMMERS AND GRIFTERS USE SOCIAL MEDIA TO SELL BOGUS PRODUCTS. AND PUSH CONSPIRACIES INCLUDING MONETIZING THE PANDEMIC IN GROTESQUE WAYS TO SELL SPEAKERS OR TO SCARE MONGER. GOING INTO THE PANDEMIC ANTI VACCINATION ACTIVISTS HAD A HUGE ADVANTAGE OVER PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS. BECAUSE ANTI VACCINATION ACTIVISTS WERE ABLE TO LEVERAGE ALREADY DENSE AND SPRAWLING NETWORKS ACROSS SOCIAL MEDIA. AS A RESULT RESULT IN A TAX ATTACHED THERE'S BREAKS TO BREAKING NEWS CYCLES BY ATTACKING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN SCIENCE. THERE WAS NO AND THERE WAS NOTHING PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS COULD DO TO STOP THE TORRENT OF MISINFORMATION. TRENDING DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS AS EVIDENCED BY THE REPORTING OF BRAINTEASER DRAWN STAND BEN. COLLINS SENIOR. SAME SITUATION HOLD FOR PUBLIC SERVANTS LIKE ELECT OFFICIAL WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE COST OF ELECT DECEMBER. AND ARE LEAVING THEIR JOBS BECAUSE IT'S ME BECAUSE MANAGING MISINFORMATION AT SCALE IS COMPLETELY UNSUSTAINABLE. FOR JOURNALISTS RESEARCHERS AND EVERYONE TRYING TO MITIGATE MISINFORMATION THE EXPERIENCE IS LIKE TRYING TO PUT YOUR HANDS UP AGAINST THE GROWING OCEAN SWELL AS IT WASHES OVER YOU. JOURNALIST UNIVERSITIES PUBLIC SERVICE AND ARE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS TAKE ON THE TRUE COST OF MISINFORMATION SCALE WHICH IS- WHICH ISN'T JUST AN EXISTENTIAL STATEMENT. THE END OF RESOURCES LOS TO MITIGATING MISINFORMATION AT SCALE WHERE THE COST OF DOING NOTHING IT'S EVEN WORSE FOR EXAMPLE TAKE A BLATANT LIE THAT VACCINES HAVE MICROCHIPS TO COUNTER IT JOURNALIST. TRADED OFF COVERING OTHER STORIES WERE PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS CONTINUE EXPLAINED THAT THERE ARE NO MICROCHIPS I IN THE VACCINE. THE ONLY WAY TO FIX A PROBLEM LIKE MOTIVATED MISINFORMATION XSCALE INVOLVES CLAPBOARDS AND BURRITT ENFORCING EARNED SIXTEEN POLICIES. RESEARCHERS AND JOURNALISTS WORKING TOGETHER IT'S TECH WATCHDOGS AND POLICY MAKING YOUR- OPENING AWAY FOR A PUBLIC INTEREST INTERNET. REGULATOR SHOULD INTRODUCE PUBLIC INTEREST OBLIGATIONS TO SOCIAL MEDIA NEWSFEEDS AND TIMELINES SO THAT TIMELY LOCAL RELEVANT AND ACCURATE INFORMATION REACHES THE MASSES. SCALE TOGETHER WE MUST MAKE A PUBLIC INTEREST INTERNET A WHOLE OF SOCIETY- PRIORITY. BUT WHAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT STUDYING THE INTERNET OVER THE LAST DECADE IS FAIRLY SIMPLE EVERYTHING OPEN WILL BE EXPLOITED THERE'S NOTHING PARTICULARLY NEW ABOUT MISINFORMATION CONSPIRACIES CIRCULATING AFTER ALL THERE'S NO COMMUNICATION WITHOUT MISINFORMATION. HOWEVER OVER THE LAST DECADE THE DESIGN OF SOCIAL MEDIA ITSELF CREATED FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR REACHING MILLIONS INSTANTANEOUSLY WHILE ALSO INCORPORATING FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL EXEMPTION. FOR CONDUCTING MASSIVE MEDIA MANIPULATION CAMPAIGNS THE MOST DANGEROUS ASPECTS OF THESE PRODUCTS COME TO LIGHT WHEN WE ANALYZED- JAMES AN ADVANTAGE WHEN OPENNESS NEED SCALE- WELL SOME MAY DEBATE THE D. EXISTENCE OF THE RABBIT HOLE ON SOCIAL MEDIA OUR RESEARCH UNIT SHORENSTEIN HAS BEEN LOOKING DEEPER AT THIS PHENOMENON. GOING DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE MEANS GETTING PULLED INTO ONLINE COMMUNITIES ARE SUB CULTURES WHERE THE SLAYING VALUES NORMS AND PRACTICES ARE UNFAMILIAR BUT NEVERTHELESS COMPLETELY ENGROSSING. THEREFORE ASPECTS OF THE DESIGN OF SOCIAL MEDIA THAT LEADS SOMEONE DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE. INCLUDING ABOUT A MINUTE- REPUTATION WHICH IS A KEY FEATURE THAT RELATES TO SEEING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER ON A SINGLE PRODUCT. REDUNDANCY IS SEEING THE SAME THING ACROSS DIFFERENT PRODUCTS RESPONSIVENESS IS HOW SOCIAL MEDIA AND SEARCH ENGINES ALWAYS PROVIDES SOME ANSWER UNLIKE OTHER FORMS OF MEDIA SO IF YOU ASK YOUR- SEARCH ENGINE WHAT IS Q. AN HONOR WHAT IS- ELECTROMAGNETIC VACCINES. YOU REINFORCEMENT IS THE WAY THAT ALGORITHMS WORK TO CONNECT PEOPLE AND CONTENT SO THAT ONCE YOU SEARCH FOR A SLOGAN OR KEYWORD ALGORITHMS WILL REINFORCE THESE INTERESTS. SO REPETITION REDUNDANCY RESPONSIVENESS AND REINFORCEMENT ARE KEY ASPECTS OF THE DESIGN OF SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS MAKE KEEP PEOPLE. STUCK IN THESE RABBIT HOLES WHERE THEY ARE I CONSISTENTLY RE INTRODUCED TO- NOXIOUS CONSPIRACY THEORIES IDEAS ARE MEANS LIKE CRACKING VACCINES CAUSE AUTISM OR OUT WILD AND OUTLANDISH CLAIMS. BY C. COMMUNITIES LIKE YOU AND I THE ACT I JFK GONNA RIDE FROM THE DEAD AND SCREENS DAHLE TRUMP- BUT WHAT'S AND- HERE IS ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH THE RABBIT HOLE WAS USED TO. BUILD OUR FIRST TOP THE STEEL AND WHAT'S REALLY AREN'T THAT IMPORTANT IS THAT WE KNOW THAT FACEBOOK ALSO KNEW. THAT THEIR STOCK THE STEEL GROUPS WERE GROWING EXPONENTIALLY ON THEIR PLATFORMS AND ADDS SOME OF THIS CONTENT TO WAS VIOLENT AND EXCITING AND FACEBOOK STRUGGLED. TO REMOVE THAT CONTENT BECAUSE OF THIS SHEER SCALE AND VOLUME AT WHICH IT WAS ARE CURRENTLY. MISINFORMATION IS A SCARE AT SCALE IS A FEATURE OF FACEBOOK SOUND DESIGN AND IT'S NOT EASILY ROUTED OUT. AND BECAUSE FACEBOOK DEFINES THE PROBLEM OF MISINFORMATION AT SCALE IS ONE OF COORDINATED INAUTHENTIC BEHAVIOR THEY WERE WOEFULLY UNPREPARED TO HANDLE THE THREATS POSED BY THEIR OWN PRODUCTS. BUT I'M HOPEFUL THAT ANOTHER FUTURE IS POSSIBLE IF TECH COMPANIES REGULATORS RESEARCHERS AND ADVOCACY IN THE WORK TOGETHER TO BUILD THE PUBLIC INTEREST INTERNET MODELED ON THE PRINCIPLES THAT THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT ACCESS. ACCURATE INFORMATION ON DEMAND.% MAN I DO BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO BRING THE SCOURGE OF MISINFORMATION AT SCALE. TO AN END THANK YOU. THANK YOU- DR DON. FONG QUESTIONS COME. SAYS. THANK YOU MISTER EIGHT I WANTED NOTED THAT SENATOR PAN- ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES IS TUNING IN LIVE HERE IT WAS IN ABLE TO JOIN US IN PERSON BUT- HAS BEEN WORKING ON. MISINFORMATION ISSUES AND DISINFORMATION ISSUES FOR NUMBER YEARS- SO IF I CAN CHANNEL ONE OF HIS QUESTIONS HERE TO THE PANELIST- SHOULD POLICY MAKERS EXPECT INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES TO DETERMINE WHAT OUR CONSPIRACIES OR MISINFORMATION PROMOTED ON THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA FEEDS- SHOULD THIS BE A SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN YOUR VIEW. OR EVEN AN INDUSTRY IT HAS TO BE A SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY I'LL TELL YOU ARE WE FOLLOWING THE Q. ANON COMMENT ON FOR QUITE A LONG TIME BEFORE IT. WE BECAME A MASSIVE PHENOMENON. AND STILL THERE ARE POINTS ALONG THE WAY THAT IT IF YOU DO SPECIALIZE IN UNDERSTANDING THESE DIFFERENT SUBCULTURES YOU CAN UNDERSTAND. THE MOMENTS WHEN THEY BEGIN TO GROW THE MOMENTS WHEN THEY START TO GET MORE AND MORE ATTENTION- BUTTE COUNTY MAN- FIGURE OUT TO SOME DEGREE ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE PLANNING FOR MASS VIOLENT EVENTS. IT WAS NO SURPRISE TO ANY RESEARCHER JOURNALIST THAT WAS COVERING- MAGGA AFTER THE ELECTION THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE AN INCIDENT AT THE CAPITOL PEOPLE KNEW THAT THE CAPITAL WAS GONNA BE STORMED- BUT IT DOES TAKE A VERY STATUS ACTUALIZED OF KNOWLEDGE WHERE PEOPLE ARE. RESEARCHING AND WATCHING THESE- THESE THESE PHENOMENON DEVELOPED AND IT'S REALLY A PROBLEM OF SCALE THAT IF YOU THINK ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS THERE REALLY LIKE- BOOMBOXES. THE CONTENT IS THE CASSETTE TAPE THAT GOES IN THEM AND THEN OUR ALGORITHMS ON THE VOLUME THAT DRIVES. HOW MANY PEOPLE END UP HEARING IT SUIT YOU SHOULD REALLY THINK ABOUT THEM. I IN THAT WAY AND THINK ABOUT WELL WHO TURNS THE VOLUME AND RIGHT NOW IT'S PLATFORM COMPANIES. WHO TEND TO TURN THE VOLUME UP ON THINGS THAT ARE NOT WHEN OUTRAGEOUS- WHICH NOW WE CAN TELL MOBILIZES PEOPLE TO DO THINGS OFF PLATFORM BUT SO WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU IS- WHEN I WHEN YOU SAY IT SHOULD BE BORNE BY SOCIETY AND LARGER SOCIAL COST. ARE YOU SAYING BY- BY THE COMPANIES THEMSELVES- BECAUSE THERE THE VOLUME CONTROLLERS ARE YOU SAYING BY. BY GOVERNMENT OR SOME OTHER PUBLIC KIND OF INSTITUTION. I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE- A PUBLIC AGENCY THAT LOOKS OUT FOR THIS. KIND OF CONTENT WHETHER IT'S RUN BY THE GOVERNMENTS ARE. CONTRACTED IN SOME WAY TO HAVE CIVIL SOCIETY. OUR WORK ON THAT ASPECT. BY AND LARGE LOOKING MEANS LIABILITY WITHIN THESE COMPANIES SO THERE ARE NO WAY INCENTIVIZE TO SEEK OUT. THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY IS WE SAW A FAIR AMOUNT OF- DOMESTIC. DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS IN TWENTY TWENTY WHERE IS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN- WE SAW MORE FOREIGN INFLUENCE AN ANONYMOUS. I TAX AND SO I DO THINK THAT THIS. DATE THE IT IS THE TIME NOW FOR SOME FORM OF GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT ESPECIALLY WHEN. THESE THESE MANIPULATORS ARE USING FAKE ACCOUNTS ARE THERE USING ADVERTISING THAT'S BUILT INTO THE PLATFORM. THERE ARE USING LOOKALIKE AUDIENCES IN ORDER TO TARGET- VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IT'S REALLY A DUTY OF CARE THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND- MEASURES FOR YOU WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE REGULATION THAT. HAS SOME KIND OF MEASURES OF TRANSPARENCY ANNOUNCER THERE'S THESE COMPANIES STARTED JUMPING BUT I DID WANT TO PULL ON ONE THREAD YOU SAID LOOKING MEANS LIABILITY CAN YOU CAN YOU EXPLAIN FURTHER WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT. WELL YOU CAN SEE WITH THE FACEBOOK WHISTLEBLOWER LEAKS THESE ARE MASSIVE TROVE OF DOCUMENTS THAT THEY DID NOT WANT THE PUBLIC TO SEE. AND MADE CERTAINLY DID NOT WANT THE SEC OR THE FTC TO BE LOOKING AT THESE DOCUMENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE FOR IT PROVIDES THE BASIS OF SHARED BACK. IN ONE OF THOSE DOCUMENTS WHERE THEY ARE FACEBOOK ITSELF SET UP A DUMMY ACCOUNT NAMED CAROL WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS SHE'S GETTING SERVED. AT CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND THEN- WITHIN A WEEK SHE WAS GETTING Q. ONE ON CONTENT AND ALL THAT ACCOUNT TO DONE WAS LIKE CONSERVATIVE ACCOUNTS. AND LIKE CONSERVATIVE NEWS ORGANIZATION. AND THE ALGORITHM- FACEBOOK ARRAY. SYSTEM WHAT IN SAN. I THE SPREAD OF THIS- THESE CONSPIRACY THEORIES TO THIS VERY UNIQUE POPULATION AND- DO YOU THINK THERE'S THEIR ACTUAL COULD BEAR LEGAL LIABILITY UNDER SOME NEGLIGENCE OR- SOME OTHER SORT OF. CLASS ACTION HORROR MOVIE- IF THEY'RE SHOWING SORT OF A WILLFUL DISREGARD FOR. THE FORESEEABLE RISKS TO THEIR USERS. YOU MENTION OKAY IT MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY BE THEIR CONSPIRACY CONTENT BUT WHEN IT COMES TO SUICIDE AND SELF HARM. I THEY DO COMPANIES DO WORK VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT- EATING DISORDER CONTENT IS NOT. SHOWN TO PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A AS WELL AS SUICIDE IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT LOOK UP ONLINE OR DIFFERENT METHODS ARE AHEAD OF TIME SO. THE COMPANIES ARE PARTICULARLY FACEBOOK AND TRIED TO- REMEDY THAT SITUATION- BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS PERFECT ESPECIALLY ON INSTAGRAM AND SO THE MORE WE KNOW ABOUT HOW THESE ALGORITHMS WORK AND HOW THEY- AND- INSPIRE CERTAIN KINDS OF BEHAVIOR AND SITE CERTAIN KINDS OF PUBLIC UPRISINGS. THE BETTER OFF WE'RE GOING TO BE AS A SOCIETY IF WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE HOSE HARMS COME FROM AND- AND IF THE PENALTIES DON'T ALREADY EXIST ARE. THEY MAY HAVE TO BE- YOU KNOW- LOADED ON DOWN THE LINE THE OTHER THING I'LL SAY IS THE ADVERTISING ON THERE'S A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF. ADVERTISING THROUGH THESE PLATFORMS BUT IN PARTICULAR FACEBOOK THE BEGINNING OF A PANDEMIC WE SAW A LOT OF- AND PVDF MASKS AND OUR LOTS IN OUR HAND SANITIZER. INSURANCE AND A LOT OF THESE WERE BOGUS ADVERTISING. I AND SO WHAT. WE KNOW NOW IS THAT THE BECAUSE FACEBOOK DOESN'T REALLY WORK MY IN THE WAY OF THEIR- OF WHO ARE. ARE WHAT YOUR BUSINESS IS AND IN ORDER TO. DO ADVERTISING WE ALSO NEED TO HAVE MUCH MORE TRANSPARENCY. ON THAT END AS WELL. I'LL JUST RAPPERS CHURNED IN DEFERRED BACK TO THE COMMITTEE BUT- I DID WANT TO NOTE AND SEE IN IN YOUR IN YOUR FURTHER COMMENTS AND ASSURANCE DEAN THE CENTER YOU YOU'RE PART OF PUT OUT. A NUMBER OF REPORTS ON- QUANTIFYING THE SOCIAL EXTERNALITIES SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU KNOW WHERE THESE HARMS COME FROM BUT HOW MUCH HARM. AND GETTING TO SOME KIND OF QUANTIFIABLE OR QUALITATIVE METRICS FOR- WHAT THE ACTUAL NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES OF THESE NETWORK EFFECTS ARE IF YOU WILL- THINK DELIVER ME OR ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES. WROTE THAT IT WAS A FORMER OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT DO YOU HAVE. IT EITHER NOW WERE IN FUTURE COMMENTS ANY- THOUGHTS ON THIS ENDEAVOR OF ACTUALLY STARTING TO HAVE SOME COMMON ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR WHAT SOCIAL EXTERNALITIES ARE AND TRYING TO GET DISCLOSURE IN THAT WAY A LITTLE MORE UNIFORMS SO THAT WE CAN. KIND OF APPLES TO APPLES COMPARECARDS PLATFORMS OR EVEN ACROSS FARMS- AND HEAVY DEBT DEAL BETTER WITH CHILD **** THAN THEY HAVE FOR POLITICAL DISINFORMATION IF THEY STRUGGLED MORE WITH- Q. AND ON OUR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES BUT DONE A BETTER JOB AT- HUMAN TRAFFICKING ISSUES OR- ACTIVE YOU KNOW- IT INSTANCES OF GENOCIDE THAT WE'VE SEEN- DOWN IN. WITH THE ROHINGYA THEY'VE HAVE THEY STARTED TO FERRET OUT THOSE SORT OF ACTIVE CALLS FOR VIOLENCE I DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF SORT OF HOW THE PLATFORMS ARE ASSESSING THOSE RISKS BUT IT SEEMS LIKE YOU ALL. HAVE DONE SOME WORK IN THAT REGARD SO WOULD LOVE YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT NOW WE'RE GOING FORWARD. THANK YEAH SO WE'RE STARTING TO WRITE ABOUT THAT WE HAVE A CONFERENCE COMING UP IN MARCH WE'RE GONNA BRING IN CLIMATE. SCIENTISTS YOU CAN TALK ABOUT HOW DO YOU YOU WANT. THE COST ACCORDING CHANGE AND- GOOD FOR BURKE- BURKE DISEASE FOR FRAMEWORK THAT WERE LOOK INTO ONES LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE COST OF CANCER. AREN'T TO SOCIETY AND TO THE LABOR FORCE AND WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT PER SECTOR YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE COST OF MISINFORMATION AT SCALE WHEN MANY- LARGE NEWS RENTS HAVE TO BRING ON A DISINFORMATION REPORTER OR TWO OR THREE. I AND YOU SEE THAT OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS IT'S POPPED UP IN A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT. ART NEWS ROUNDS AND THEN OF COURSE LOCAL NEWS OPERATIONS ARE NOT ABLE TO FULLY ARMED BRING ON DISINFORMATION. REPORTERS BY. THE MORE WE SEE DISINFORMATION TARGETING LOCAL ELECTIONS AND HAPPENING ON A- VERY SMALL SCALE LIKE KERN THE CASE OF WHAT HAPPENED TO MICHAEL TUBBS IN STOCKTON WHERE THERE WAS A- A FACEBOOK PAGE THAT WAS REALLY DRIVING THIS IDEA THAT HE WAS A VERY CORRUPT. PERSON BUT WE HAVE TO DO MORE RESEARCH ON THAT AND WE ARE REALLY. AT THE FOREFRONT OF BEGINNING- TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WATER THE QUANTITATIVE MEASURES THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO USE ARE IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN SURVEY FOR INSTANCE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS. RIGHT NOW WHAT WE KNOW IS EVERYBODY'S QUITTING. ALEXION OFFICIALS ARE QUITTING. PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE QUITTING AND ONE OF THE BIG REASONS IS THAT THEY CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THE FLOW- MISINFORMATION. AND AS WELL IT TAKES A IN OUR PERSONAL TOLL ON THEM ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE BEING TARGETED WE ALSO SEE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE- RESIGNING FROM POSITIONS ON SCHOOL BOARDS FOR INSTANCE BECAUSE OF THE TARGETING. AROUND JOHN CRITICAL RACE THEORY AND TEACHING BRINGS AND RACISM ARE TEACHING CHILDREN ABOUT RACE AND RACISM. AND SAID THESE ARE BIG SOCIETY WIDE STRUGGLES AREN'T THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE SOLVED BY CREATING NEW TECHNOLOGY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE SOLVED. BY- FIXING. BUT WE DO HAVE TO HAVE THE TECH SECTOR- SB WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE TECH SECTOR MUCH BETTER AND WE HAVE TO EVEN EXPLORE IDEAS LIKE ANTI TRUST IN A WAY THAT- MAY SPLIT ADVERTISING FROM THE OTHER FUNCTIONS OF TECH COMPANIES. AREN'T SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT OUR ADVERTISING COMPANY IS ARE SPREADING THE WEALTH AROUND TOO I IN PARTICULAR JOURNALISM OROTHER WEB PAGES. AND SO ON IN SHORT WE DON'T QUITE KNOW YET WHAT THE TRUE COST OF MISINFORMATION ARE BUT IT IS A PROBLEM THAT WE'RE WORKING ON AND I'M HOPEFUL BY EARLY NEXT YEAR WE'LL HAVE. A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT MODELS AND FRAMEWORKS THAT WE CAN WORK WITH. I AND THEY'LL BE CALLED POLICE AND DISSERTATIONS AND WHAT NOT TO TAKE UP THAT. PROBLEM THANK YOU OTHER COMMENTS THIS CYNICAL EURO. WHAT I WANTED- THANK THE- THANK THE DOCTOR FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND FOR HER HER TESTIMONY I WHAT STRUCK ME WAS THE STATEMENT THAT THE CUSTOMERS A FACEBOOK AND- THESE THAT. SOCIAL PLATFORMS ARE THE COST ARE THE ADVERTISERS BECAUSE THAT TOTALLY CHEFS- THE WAY THAT I THINK OF- OF REGULATION AND HOW WE WOULD LOOK AT. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CONTENT AND HOW IT'S BEING PERVADE- SO THAT THAT WAS REALLY VERY INTERESTING AND THEN I AM I THE ONLY QUESTION I HAVE. IS THAT- IF HE YOU KNOW IT IT IT APPEARS THAT AND THERE HAS BEEN SOME DISCUSSION AROUND THE ALGORITHMS AND SHARING INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THOSE ALGORITHMS ARE CREATED FROM AT THE STATE LEVEL- WE HIRED A COMPANY WITH A CONTRACT TO DO SMALL BUSINESS. GRANTS AND IT WAS BASED ON AN ALGORITHM AND IT WAS TRUST ME WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE RIGHT. BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED AND- AND I THINK THAT IT'S PROVEN TO BE THE CASE BUT I THE QUESTION I HAVE IS. IS THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT GETTING MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE ALGORITHMS ARE ARE CREATED. AND AND THAT THEIR PROPRIETARY SO WE CAN'T REALLY TELL YOU BUT TRUST US YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO WORK OKAY AND IT IT APPEARS TO ME THAT. THAT IT THAT IT'S THE ALGORITHMS THAT CREATED THIS CONTENT THAT SHOWED UP ON THE CAROL SIDE I GUESS WAS THE NAME OF THE OF THE PERSON THAT THEY CREATED. AND THEN I JUST. WONDER IF YOU CAN COMMENT ON. ON HOW WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT ALGORITHMS AND WILL BE IN A WEEK WE WHICH I TEND TO GIVE GREAT DEFERENCE TO- TO CONFIDENCE INTO THINGS THAT ARE PART OF THE PROPRIETY IN FOR INFORMATION THAT THE COMPANY'S USE BUT IT MAY BE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY AS WELL. YES SO THE ALGORITHMS YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. YOU KNOW STATE SPOKE NICK CLEGG RECENTLY CAME OUT AND SAID THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF ALGORITHMS RUNNING ACROSS FACEBOOK. INTO IT'S NOT A CASE THAT IN. AN ALGORITHM DOES THIS YOU KNOW ALL OF THE THINGS WHAT WE EAT WHAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IS THE FACT THAT. MANY DIFFERENT I TECHNOLOGICAL PIECES LIKE CAST. MEMBER THE OLD STEREOS WE USED TO HAVE THE OF THE RECEIVER IN THE RECORD PLAYER YOU HAVE THAT CONSENT ACT. SO THINK ABOUT IT LIKE A COMPONENT SYSTEM. AND DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS ARE GOING. OUT RAINY CONTENTS AND SORT CONTENT IN DIFFERENT WAYS. AND WHAT THE RANKING IS BASED ON IS ARE. THESE LITTLE DIALS OR KNOBS THAT THEY TURN. WHERE FOR INSTANCE AT FACEBOOK THEY- AFTER JANUARY SIXTH. TURNED OUT THE KNOB THAT- ON NEWS QUALITY. AND SO IT'S NOT THE CASE THAT THE ALGORITHM WAS READING EVERY PIECE OF NEWS BECAUSE ALGORITHMS CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT'S TRUE OR FALSE OR WHAT'S LEFT OR RIGHT. BUT WHAT IT DID WAS IT IT TOOK INTO ACCOUNT. HOW ARE REPUTABLE IS THIS NEWS ORGANIZATION IS IT WIDELY TRUSTED DOES IT. HAVE AN OFFICE SPACES A HABIT SUBSCRIBERS IS IT- LET YOU KNOW ARE THERE ARE ITS ADVERTISERS ON THE UP AND UP. ON AND IT INCREASED NEWS QUALITY AND THROUGHOUT THE SITE WHAT YOU SAW. WAS THAT IT LOST BASED BURKE ENGAGEMENT BECAUSE THE CONTENT WASN'T AS CONTROVERSIAL. PEOPLE WEREN'T SHARING SOME OF THE CONTENT BECAUSE- FOR INSTANCE THE NEW YORK TIMES IS A PAY WALL SO WHY WOULD YOU SHARE THEIR ARTICLES. IF YOU'RE NOT SURE OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO GET THEM CAN EVEN SEE THEM. AND SO IT TENDS TO DO REALLY WELL ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IS THINGS THAT ARE FREE. AND THINGS THAT ARE OUTRAGEOUS. AND SO- IT TIME FOR BUT ONE THAT YOU MAY THINK OF RELATED TO THE POWER ABOUT BUT- HERE. IS A MAN ON YOU CRANSTON'S IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN I WAS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY OUR STATE AND SOCIETY ON THE ALTERNATIVE INFLUENCE NETWORK WHAT WE SHOWED WAS BASICALLY THAT. A VERY SMALL PROPORTION OF WHITE SUPREMACISTS WERE GETTING. A LOT OF ATTENTION ACROSS THE APPS AND MORE MANAGING TO GET ON OTHER PEOPLE'S. LIVE STREAMS AND WE'RE MAKING QUITE A BIT OF MONEY BY BEING COMPLETELY OUTRAGEOUS AND TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW- WHITE GENOCIDE IN THE BRAIN THE COMING OF AGE. NO STATE. AND SO WE SHOWED THEM ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE CHARACTERISTICS WERE AND WHO THESE ACCOUNTS WORK AND THEN OVER TIME WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY DEVISED A WAY WHERE THEY STARTED TO BAN. WHITE SUPREMACIST CONTENTS AND BUT A BIG FACTOR WASN'T NECESSARILY THAT THE RESEARCH WAS STOCK. WHICH IS PART OF IT BUT THE ADVERTISERS LIKE CISCO DID NOT WANT THEIR PRODUCTS. BEING SHOWN OVER WHITE SUPREMACIST CONTENT AND SO ARE THE ADVERTISERS REALLY HAD QUITE A SAY IN HOW THE TECHNOLOGY OPERATE IT. AND SAY YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WELL IF THE COMPANIES ARE GOING TO REACT TO ADVERTISING BOYCOTTS. BUT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY GONNA REACT TO OUR COMMUNITY PRESSURE OR PEOPLE SAYING YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT AT. EIGHT FOUR CONTENT ON HERE LOTS OF LIKE ANTI TRANS OR ANTI LGBT CONTENT. AND YOU KNOW LIVED SANTA CLARA FARMS IS OFFERING AND- IT'S AWFUL BUT LAWFUL. BUT ONE STEP FURTHER FROM THAT IF ADVERTISERS SAY HEY I DON'T WANT COCOA KRISPIES TO BE HONEST CONTENT. I AND- THEY DO CHANGE THE PRODUCT AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE WEIGHT OF ADVERTISING HERE AND HOW MUCH SWAY. THEY HAVE OVER THE DESIGN AND THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF THESE ALGORITHMS. MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT THE WITH THAT BINGS UP THAN IT IS ACCEPTED COMMUNITY. TO MAKE CLEAR WHAT OUR VALUES AND WHAT OUR CONCERNS ARE BECAUSE WE WANT TO PUSHTHE- THE ADVERTISERS TO BE MORE SENSITIVE TO THAT COMMUNITY NEEDS AND THAT WHAT THE COMMUNITY THINKS ABOUT. CERTAIN CONTENT- THAT'S A LOT THAT'S A LOT HARDER BUT IT'S AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS. IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT A LEGAL ANALYSIS IT'S AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS. THANK YOU- OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS SO A DOCTOR DONNA THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND EXPERTISE I'M GOING TO ASK. FOR A FAVOR ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IS DEFINING WHAT A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM IS AND THAT MAY SEEM LIKE A SIMPLE. DEFINITION BUT IT IS NOT- AND TO THE EXTENT THE THAN I KNOW YOU'VE WRITTEN AND THOUGHT ABOUT THESE ISSUES VERY DEEPLY TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE- A DEFINITION OR THOUGHTS ON THE DEFINITION I'D BE GRATEFUL IF YOU WOULD SEND THAT TO US. AND THEN SECONDLY YOU WOULD SAID THAT SOME SORT OF GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY TO. BOB PROVIDE SOME CONTENT MODERATION. I'M CONFIDENT THAT THAT I COULD DECIDE WHAT IS MISINFORMATION WAS NOT MISINFORMATION BUT SO MY COLLEAGUES MAY DISAGREE WITH ME AS TO WHAT. I MIGHT THINK IS MISINFORMATION AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY THAT DOES SUCH A THING. WHAT GUARDRAILS DO WE PUT ON THAT GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T BECOME BASED ON WHATEVER ADMINISTRATION MIGHT BE. THE APPOINTING AUTHORITY OF A VEHICLE FOR- PROMULGATION OF WHAT I MIGHT THINK IS MISINFORMATION ANY OF IT SO THANK YOU MUCH IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND IF YOU'VE GOT THOUGHTS ON THOSE TWO SUBJECTS. THAT WOULD BE GREAT AND THEN WE'VE GOT ANOTHER PANEL COMING UP AND I'M AN ASSET PANEL THE SAME QUESTIONS THE NEXT PANELS ON UNDERSTANDING LEGAL FRAMEWORKS WITH RESPECT TO. SOCIAL MEDIA SO DOCTOR DONOVAN THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME REAL PLEASURE THANKS AND THEN IT BUT I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN GENEROUSLY IF YOU'VE GOT THOUGHTS ON THOSE TWO SUBJECTS WE WELCOME THEM. THANKS ALL RIGHT OUR NEXT PANEL. WILL DISCUSS THE EXISTING LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND HOW THEY IMPACT CURRENT EFFORTS ITS CONTENT MODERATION REGULATION AND WHAT CONSTRAINTS THEY PLACE ON FURTHER REGULATION. OUR FIRST PRESENTER WILL BE PROFESSOR DAPHNE KELLER. PROFESSOR KELLER DIRECTS THE PROGRAM ON PLATFORM REGULATION STANFORD'S CYBER POLICY CENTER PROGRAM. RECENT WORK FOCUSES ON LEGAL PROTECTIONS FOR USERS FREE EXPRESSION RIGHTS WHEN STATE AND PRIVATE POWER INTERSECT. PARTICULARLY THROUGH PLATFORMS ENFORCEMENT OF TERMS OF SERVICE OR USE OF ALGORITHMIC RANKING AND RECOMMENDATIONS SHE PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNSEL FOR GOOGLE OUR SECOND PRESENTER ON THE RELEVANT LEGAL FRAMEWORK IS PROFESSOR ERIC GOLDMAN PROFESSOR GOLDMAN IS A PROFESSOR OF LAW AT SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY. IN IS THE CO DIRECTOR OF THE HIGH TECH LAW INSTITUTE WELCOME PROFESSORS KELLER YEAH PROFESSOR KELLER IN BOB PROFESSOR GOLDMAN A PROFESSOR KELLER IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE WE'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU. RIGHT I AM RIGHT HERE UNLESS YOU SAY OTHERWISE WE CAN HELP YOU QUITE CLEARLY THANK YOU. EXCELLENT UP MANY THANKS FOR INCLUDING ME IN THIS IMPORTANT SESSION IN MY PREPARED TESTIMONY TODAY I WILL TALK ABOUT FIVE FIRST AMENDMENT HURDLES TO PLATFORM REGULATION I HAVE A WRITTEN PIECE ON THIS THAT SOME PEOPLE MAY HAVE SEEN I'M ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT LIST TODAY. IF YOU ADD THEM UP IT'S MORE LIKE NINE HURDLES- BECAUSE THINGS GET VERY MESSY IN THE WORLD OF PASSED OUT FROM REGULATION ON THE FIRST AMENDMENT. MY MESSAGE TODAY IS NOT THAT THE FIRST. SEVERABLE ROOM FOR NEW. PARTICULARLY IN THE SPHERE OF PRIVACY COMPETITION AND I THINK WE NEED THOSE LAWS. LAWS EMPOWERING INDIVIDUAL USERS OUR CONSUMERS MAY HELP ADDRESS THE CONCERNS ABOUT SPEECH IN PUBLIC DISCOURSE THAT MOTIVATED THIS HEARING. IF WE HAD DOZENS OF SOCIAL NETWORKS FOR EXAMPLE NO ONE OF THEM WOULD BE SO THOROUGHLY SHAPE PUBLIC DISCOURSE THROUGH ALGORITHMS ARE CONTENT MODERATION CHOICES. NOR IS MY MESSAGE THAT COURTS CURRENT INTERPRETATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS MORALLY RIGHT OR THE BEST POLICY OR EVEN THE INEVITABLE LEGAL STANDARDS THAT WILL GOVERN US FOREVER. INTERPRETATION OF THE CONSTITUTION CHANGES OVER TIME THE PRINCIPLES I DESCRIBE TODAY COULD SHIFT OR EVOLVE AND PERHAPS THEY SHOULD. BUT THAT WILL ONLY HAPPEN WITH THE AGREEMENT OF THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE ON THE SUPREME COURT. SO I AM HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE BARRIERS THAT NEED TO BE NAVIGATED LIFE IN LIGHT OF THAT PRACTICAL AND LEGAL REALITY. ACOSTA COUNTRIES LEGISLATORS ARE SPENDING TIME CRAFTING LEGISLATION THAT IS CLEARLY CONTRARY TO THE U. S. SUPREME COURT'S CURRENT JURISPRUDENCE. OTHERS ARE PROPOSING LAWS THAT FALL IN GRAY AREAS BUT THAT STILL HAVE HIGH ODDS OF BEING STRUCK DOWN ON CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS. SO I WOULD URGE LAWMAKERS TO BE VERY CLEAR SIGHTED ABOUT WITH THAT MEETS- AND ABOUT WHERE AND HOW TO SPEND TIME AND TAXPAYER MONEY. AND POLITICAL CAPITAL ON PROPOSALS THAT MAY AT BEST BE GAMBLES AT WORST BE A WASTE OF THAT TIME AND TAXPAYER MONEY AND POLITICAL CAPITAL. THE FIRST OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT BARRIERS AND IT IS THE SIMPLEST IT IS THAT LAWMAKERS CAN'T PROHIBIT SPEECH THAT IS PROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT. IN THE U. S. THAT INCLUDES SOME HORRIFIC THINGS IT INCLUDES THINGS THAT MANY PEOPLE FIND MORALLY ABORTS THE VIDEO OF THE TERRIBLE MASKER IN CHRISTCHURCH NEW ZEALAND FOR EXAMPLE- IS LEGAL TO SHARE IT IN MANY PROBABLY MOST CONTACTS ONLINE. THE SUPREME COURT HAS EXPLICITLY SAID HE RECENTLY IT BUT HATE SPEECH IS CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED WE ALSO KNOW THAT LIES INCLUDING DANGEROUS LIGHTS ARE OFF AND CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED. A LAW THAT PROHIBITS THIS LAWFUL BUT AWFUL SPEECH IS LIKELY TO VIOLATE THE COUPLE WILL HAVE A THE CONSTITUTION UNDER CURRENT SUPREME COURT CASE LAW. THE SECOND POINT IS ALSO PRETTY OBVIOUS BUT MAYBE WHAT SPELLING OUT IF THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T RESTRICT CERTAIN SPEECH IT ALSO CAN'T HELP PLATFORMS TO RESTRICT THAT SPEECH AND I EXPLAINED IN A RECENT PAPER THIS INCLUDES LAWS TELLING PLATFORMS TO TAKE DOWN LAWFUL SPEECH. IT ALSO INCLUDES LAWS TELLING THEM TO CHANGE ALGORITHMS IN ORDER TO PROMOTE OR SUPPRESS OR MAKE LESS VISIBLE THAT SAME LAWFUL BUT PERHAPS MORALLY TERRIBLE SPEECH ALL OF THESE ARE THINGS PLATFORMS MAY DO VOLUNTARILY AND OFTEN DO AND I THINK SHOULD DO. BUT THEY LIE OUTSIDE THE POWER OF GOVERNMENT. WELL HERE IS AN IMPORTANT ONE. CAN I HELP ON THAT THAT WE SHOULD ALL AGREE ON WHICH IS THAT LAWMAKERS CAN'T CIRCUMVENT THE CONSTITUTION BY OUTSOURCING GOVERNANCE TO PRIVATE PLATFORMS. GOOD THING NONE OF US WOULD WANT TO LIVE IN A WORLD THAT BYPASSES BILL OF RIGHTS PROTECTIONS THROUGH PRIVATIZED GOVERNANCE WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SPEECH ON PLATFORMS POLICING OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT AFFECTS ALL RIGHT. MY THIRD POINT IS MORE COMPLICATED. LAWMAKERS CAN'T CRAFT RULES BUT LOOK CONSTITUTIONAL ON THEIR FACE BUT THAT PREDICTABLY IN THE FACT THAT ARE GOING TO LEAD PLATFORMS TO ERR MASSIVELY ON THE SIDE OF REMOVING LAWFUL SPEECH. THIS IS THE LESSON FROM A SUPREME COURT CASE FROM THE NINETEEN FIFTIES VERSUS CALIFORNIA IN WHICH THE COURT STRUCK DOWN A LAW HOLDING A LOS ANGELES BOOKSELLER LIABLE FOR BOOKS ON HIS SHELVES. ALTHOUGH THE LESSON OF A LARGE BODY OF HUMAN RIGHTS LITERATURE WARNING AGAINST LEGAL OBLIGATIONS THAT INCENTIVIZE PLATFORMS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES BY TAKING DOWN THEIR USERS. BUT ACTUALLY LEGAL SPEECH WE KNOW THAT RULES LIKE THIS ARE ABUSE OF THE GOVERNMENT ACT OF ECUADOR FOR EXAMPLE SEEMINGLY USED FALSE LEGAL ALLEGATIONS TO GET YOUTUBE FACEBOOK AND OTHER PLATFORMS TO REMOVE VIDEO FOOTAGE OF POLICE BRUTALITY AND CRITICAL JOURNALISM. THIS IS AN AREA WHERE A LOT OF MY RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THAT YES I'M HAPPY TO TALK MORE ABOUT THAT THE DETAIL CARE AND CLEANING HOW NOT JUST SPEECH RIGHTS THAT RIGHTS TO PRIVACY AND EQUAL PROTECTION CAN BE ON THE LINE. WITH LAWS LIKE THIS. THE FOURTH OF MY FIVE POINT GETS INTO TERRITORY THAT IS A LESSON TO IT. AND WHILE THE FIRST THREE POINTS MORE MOST RELEVANT FOR PROPOSALS CURRENTLY COMING MORE FROM THE POLITICAL LEFT. THIS ONE RELATES TO PROPOSALS THAT TEND TO COME TODAY FROM THE POLITICAL RIGHT. TO BE CLEAR I DON'T ACTUALLY THINK ANY OF THINGS THESE THINGS ARE INNATELY POLITICAL OR LEFT RIGHT ISSUES- BUT THIS IS HOW THE POLITICS IN AMERICA TODAY HAPPENS TO LINE UP. THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE IS THIS LAWMAKERS CAN'T TELL PLATFORMS WHAT EDITORIAL STANDARDS TO SAT OR DICTATE THEIR CONTENT MODERATION OR BANKING STANDARDS. JUST AS GOVERNMENT CAN'T TELL THEM WHAT LAWFUL SPEECH THEY MUST TAKE DOWN. THEY ALSO CAN'T TELL THEM WHAT LAWFUL SPEECH THEY MUST CARRY. THIS IS WHY IT DISTRICT COURT RECENTLY STRUCK DOWN A FLORIDA LAW THAT ATTEMPTED TO DO JUSTICE THANK THAT POPCORN'S HAD TO LEAVE UP CERTAIN ACCOUNTS OR POSTS RELATING TO ELECTIONS AND POLITICAL DISCUSSION. AND TO BE CLEAR THE CASE LAW HERE ISN'T ABOUT INTERNET USERS SPEECH RIGHT SO MUCH. THIS IS ABOUT PLATFORM SPEECH RIGHT. FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE THERE IS A LONG OF SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT IDENTIFYING EDITORIAL RATES FOR COMPANIES THAT SELECTIVELY CHERRY THIRD PARTY SPEECH. INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE CABLE COMPANIES AND JUDGES INCLUDING BRETT KAVANAUGH TWENTY SADDAM THAT THE- DC. CIRCUIT COURT I HAVE POINTED OUT THESE PRESIDENTS AS CLEAR BARRIERS TO HAVING SIMILAR MUST CARRY OBLIGATIONS FOR PLATFORMS LIKE YOUTUBE OR TWITTER. THIS TOO IS AN AREA I HAVE A LONG ARTICLE ABOUT AND I AM HAPPY TO TALK MORE ABOUT IT IF PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN DOING SO. MY FINAL POINT AND THIS IS ONE I HAVE TRULY MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT IS THAT THERE ARE POTENTIALLY VERY STEEP CONSTITUTIONAL BARRIERS. EVEN TOO MANY FORMS OF COMPELLED TRANSPARENCY REPORTING FOR COMPANIES. ERIC GOLDMAN HIS TESTIFYING AFTER ME HAS DONE MORE RESEARCH ON THIS TOPIC AND CAN SPEAK MORE TO THE LAW BUT THE BASIC ISSUE AS LAID OUT IN A RECENT CASE THAT STRUCK DOWN A MARYLAND LAW REQUIRING TRANSPARENCY ABOUT CAMPAIGN ADS. GETS BACK TO THIS IDEA THAT PLATFORMS ARE FUNCTIONING OF PUBLISHERS AND THAT COMPELLING A PLATFORM TO STATE WHAT SPEECH AT REJECTED AND WHY IT IS SIMILAR TO FORCING THE LOS ANGELES TIMES TO SAY WHAT ARTICLES IT MAN. AND WHY AND SHOULD EXPLAIN ITS PROCESS FOR DECISION MAKING. I DON'T LOVE THAT OUTCOME I CONSIDER MYSELF AN ADVOCACY FOR BETTER TRANSPARENCY AND I AM HAPPY THAT PENDING EUROPEAN UNION LAWS ARE LIKELY TO GET IT FOR US. I SPEND MOST OF MY TIME THINKING ABOUT WHAT GOOD TRANSPARENCY LOOKS LIKE ABOUT HOW TO DO TRANSPARENCY AND NOT WHETHER THE CONSTITUTIONAL. CONSTITUTION PROHIBITS IT AS A LEGAL OBLIGATION. THAT SAID I WOULD ALSO BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING FIFTY DIFFERENT TRANSPARENCY MANDATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AS I DISCUSSED IN A RECENT BLOG POST THE COMPLEXITY AND EXPENSE OF TRANSPARENCY REPORTING ARE VERY REAL PARTICULARLY FOR SMALLER COMPANIES IF WE'RE GOING TO IMPOSE THAT COST AND ACCEPT THE BURDEN THAT MAY PLACE ON COMPETITION AND ON THAT DIVERSITY OF ONLINE SPEECH ECOSYSTEMS. WE SHOULD HAVE A CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT BENEFITS WE'RE GETTING AND WHAT PARTICULAR KINDS OF DISCLOSURES ARE LIKELIEST TO GET US THERE. ALL CLOSE BY BRIEFLY MENTIONING A COUPLE OF OTHER PARTS OF THE CONSTITUTION. SOME LIKE THIS THE PRIMACY AND DORMANT COMMERCE CLAUSE IS FUNCTION TO AVOID THE KIND OF FRAGMENTATION- THAT I WAS JUST REFERRING TO BY RESERVING CERTAIN POWERS TO FEDERAL CONGRESS AND- I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW FRUSTRATING THAT MUST BE TO YOU AS YOU WATCH THE GRIDLOCK. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. OTHERS LIKE THE TAKINGS CLAUSE WOULD BE RELEVANT FOR LAWS ON THIS SORT OF UTILITY OR COMMON CARRIAGE OR PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS MODEL. THAT WOULD TAKE AWAY PLATFORMS ABILITY TO ENFORCE CONTENT POLICIES OPENING THEM UP TO A GLUT OF OFFENSIVE OR USELESS CONTENT DRIVING AWAY USERS AND ADVERTISERS AND GREATLY DEVALUING. THE PROPERTY THAT THEY HAVE DEVELOPED. AS I SAID AT THE START MY MESSAGE IS NOT ONE OF PARALYSIS BOB WHAT CAN AND SHOULD BE REGULATED I'VE WRITTEN AT LENGTH ABOUT MODELS FROM AROUND THE WORLD PARTICULARLY FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION AND LATIN AMERICA. I'M HOPEFUL FOR CHANGE FROM COMPETITION OR PRIVACY LAW IN THE U. S. AND AS I SAID I THINK THAT CHANGE CAN HELP ADDRESS MANY OF THESE SPEECH PUBLIC DISCOURSE. AND SUPPORT ISSUES THAT THAT WE ARE SEEING TODAY. BUT WE WILL NOT MAKE THAT PROGRESS YOU KNOW AS LAWYERS- THAT. ARE YOU YOU KNOW YOU WOULD LAWMAKERS WON'T MAKE THAT PROGRESS BY CHARGING OFF IN THE WRONG DIRECTION CONSTITUTIONAL CASE LAW PROVIDES US A MAC- AND THE MAP INCLUDE SOME THAT SO WE NEED TO NAVIGATE ACCORDINGLY- SORRY I KEEP SAYING WE THE SEEMS ARROGANT WHEN I'M SPEAKING TO ACTUAL LAWMAKERS THE LAWMAKING COMMUNITY. THE LAWYER COMMUNITY NEEDS TO LOOK CAREFULLY AT THE LAW NAVIGATE ACCORDINGLY AND- SORT OUT PRODUCTIVE WAYS FORWARD THANK YOU FOR THE TIME ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK. I THANK YOU PROFESSOR KELLER NEXT MISTER GOLDMAN MISTER GOLDMAN. YEAH GOOD MORNING CAN YOU HEAR ME OK WE CAN HEAR YOU PERFECTLY THANK YOU AWESOME TERRIFIC THANK YOU. YES SO- I MIRACLE MAN I'M A PROFESSOR OF LAW AND ASSOCIATE DEAN FOR RESEARCH AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW. IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA I'VE BEEN TEACHING AND RESEARCHING INTERNET LAW ESPECIALLY SECTION TWO THIRTY FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS I STARTED ADVISING INTERNET SERVICES ABOUT HOW TO BUILD AND OPERATE THEIR COMMUNITIES. BEFORE SECTION TWO THIRTY WAS ENACTED- I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY JUST BECAUSE HEARING THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE CHANCE. BUT GIVEN THAT THE- LEGISLATURE'S JURISDICTION INCLUDES AND SILICON VALLEY. IT MAKES SENSE TO LIVE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURES WOULD ESTABLISHED RULES FOR ENOUGH SERVICES IT WOULD BE THIS LEGISLATURE. UNFORTUNATELY STATE LEGISLATURES HAVE LIMITED OR NO ROLE TO PLAY IN TELLING INTERNET SERVICES HOW TO MANAGE THEIR EDITORIAL OPERATIONS. THE FIRST AMENDMENT AS- MISS KELLER EXPLAINED SEVERELY RESTRICTS ANY LEGISLATIVE MANDATES ABOUT INTERNET SERVICES EDITORIAL DECISIONS. AND THE DAHMER DORMANT COMMERCE CLAUSE FURTHER RESTRICTS THE LET CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY TO REGULATE GLOBAL MEDIA OF LIKE INTERNET SERVICE SINCE. SHARKS I'VE BEEN ASKED TO WHY SECTION TO ALSO READ THE LEGISLATURE DISCRETION- AND CERTAINLY IN THE INNER AT ANY REGULATORY EFFORT UNDERTAKEN BY THIS LEGISLATURE MUST ACCOUNT FOR SECTION TWO THIRTY. HOWEVER IT NAVIGATE AROUND SECTION TWO THIRTY WON'T BE ENOUGH TO SOLVE ALL THE ISSUES BECAUSE CONSTITUTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS WHEN VERY LARGE IN ANY EFFORT TO REGULATE OR CONTROL SOCIAL MEDIA. I'LL START BY PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW OF SECTION TWO THIRTY CONGRESS ENACTED THE LAW IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX WITH THE EXPRESS INTENT OF PROVIDING GREATER EDITORIAL DISCRETION TO INTERNET SERVICES. CONGRESS ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL BY REDUCING GOVERNMENT REGULATION INCLUDING LIABILITY FOR HOW INTERNET SERVICES MANAGE THIRD PARTY CONTENT. THE STATUTE EXPRESSLY NOTES THAT AMERICANS HAVE BENEFITTED FROM QUOTE A MINIMUM OF GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF THE INTERNET. ESSENTIAL TAKEAWAY TELL CONGRESS SOUGHT TO QUOTE RESERVE THE VIBRANT INDEPENDENT FREE MARKET THAT PRESENTLY EXIST FOR THE INTERNET AND OTHER INTERACTIVE COMPUTER SERVICES UNFETTERED BY FEDERAL OR STATE REGULATION. THAT SECTION TWO THIRDS ARE FOR V. SAYS THAT WEBSITES AREN'T FOR THIRD PARTY CONTACT. THIS BASIC LEGAL PRINCIPLE HAS SPURRED A REVOLUTION AND HOW MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER AND WE IN CALIFORNIA HERE BENEFITTED GREATLY FROM DOT REVOLUTION. SECTION TODAY PROVIDES A LEGAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR AN INDUSTRY THAT POWERS THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND HELP CALIFORNIANS DO THEIR WORK ADVANCE OUR EDUCATION PERFORMANCE CENTRAL SERVICES AND ENJOY THEIR LEISURE TIME. SECTION TWO THIRTY ELIMINATE SOME TYPES OF LIABILITY BASED ON THIRD PARTY CONTENT BUT IT LEAVES OTHER REGULATORY TOOLS IN PLACE. FOR THIS REASON I'M BAFFLED I SEE SECTION TWO THIRTY CHARACTERIZED AS TRADING QUOTE A LAWLESS NO MAN'S LAND ON THE INTERNET OR A QUOTE WILD WEST. INSTEAD I'LL MENTION THREE WAYS IN WHICH SECTION TWO THIRTY. PRESERVES REGULATORY EFFORTS. FIRST SECTION TO THIRTIES LIABILITY MODEL ENCOURAGES INTERNET SERVICES TO UNDERTAKE SOCIALLY VALUABLE EDITORIAL SERVICES THAT THEY WOULD OTHERWISE ISSUE IF THEY- FACE LIABILITY FOR THEIR EDITORIAL JUDGMENT CALLS WERE ERRORS. WITHOUT SECTION TWO THIRDS PROTECTION AND I BELIEVE A STELLAR MENTIONED AS INTERNET SERVICES. MIGHT TURN INTO AN ANYTHING GOES FREE FOR ALL SPEECH VENUES- AN OUTCOME THAT NO ONE WOULD FIND VALUABLE. I THINK THE OTHER MORE LIKELY START IS THAT WITHOUT SECTION TWO THIRTY ERRANT'S SERVICES WOULD FIND USER GENERATED CONTENT TO RISKING AND SIMPLY. SHUT DOWN OUR ABILITY TO TALK TO EACH OTHER. BUT SECOND RECORD F. IS SET THE ORIGINAL OF ILLEGAL CONTENT NEVER QUALIFIES FOR SECTION TWO THIRTY IMMUNITY. THERE'S ALWAYS AT LEAST ONE PERSON LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERY LEGAL VIOLATION ONLINE. AND THE THIRD WAY- THE CONGRESS RESERVED REGULATORY EFFORTS IS THAT CONGRESS. CREATED SEVERAL CATEGORIES WERE INTERNET SERVICES REMAINED LIABLE FOR THIRD PARTY CONTENT WITHOUT RUNNING AFOUL SECTION TWO THIRTY. FROM THE BEGINNING SECTION TO THEIR EXCLUDED THREE TYPES OF CLAIMS ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT OF ECPA AND STATE LAW COMPLIANCE- INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS AND FEDERAL CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CONGRESS ADDED A FOURTH INSTRUCTION AS PART OF FOSTER. BECAUSE SECTION TWO THERE IS NEVER PROVIDE A BLANKET IMMUNITY THE EXCEPTIONS HAVE BEEN ON THE BOOKS THAT SINCE SECTION TWO THIRTY ALL WITHIN ACTED CONGRESS IS ALWAYS LEFT ROOM FOR SOME ROOM FOR PLAINTIFFS TO SEEK. LEGAL REDRESS FOR THIRD PARTY CONTENT. FROM THE OUTSET CONGRESS MAILING RESERVED IN THE REGULATION OF LIABILITY FOR THIRD PARTY CONTENT TO ITSELF NOT TO THE STATE. THE DRAFTERS GOAL WAS GENERALLY TO ENSURE THAT INTERNET SERVICES ONLY NEED TO COMPLY WITH A SINGLE NATIONAL STANDARD NOT THE CACOPHONY OF DIFFERENT REGULATORY APPROACHES AT THE STATE LEVEL. TO WHICH HE- THIS GOAL PROGRESS. SAYS THAT SECTION TO DURING PRAMS- INCONSISTENT STATE LAWS. CONGRESS ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE PRIMACY OF FEDERAL LAW OVER STATE LAW BY EXCLUDING OF FEDERAL CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS FROM SECTION TWO THIRTY BUT NOT EXCITING STATE CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS. CONGRESS SLIGHTLY LICENSE LESS THAN THAT AND FOSTER. ETHNOLOGY THE PROBLEMS WITH HEADED ST LOS CIRCA HAS ALSO CONCLUDED THAT THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EXCEPTION TO SECTION TWO THIRTY ONLY APPLIES TO FEDERAL ID CLAIMS- AND OTHER SECTION TO THE REPLIES TO STATE IP CLAIMS. THAT IS REALLY FRUSTRATING FOR THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE THAT CONGRESS HAS LIMITS UNLIMITED SOUTH RD. CONGRESS IS NOT COMPLETELY ELIMINATE THE STATE'S REGULATORY AUTHORITY OVER THE PUBLICATION THIRD PARTY CONTENT. COPIED CALIFORNIA WOULD NOT RUN AFOUL OF SECTION TWO THIRTY FOR LAWS THAT IMPOSE LIABILITY SIMILAR TO THE EPA. OR THE RESTRICT FROM PERSONAL SEX FOR MOTIONS HOWEVER I REITERATE THAT ANY EFFORTS TO IMPOSE LIABILITY FOR THIRD PARTY CONTENT INVESTORS WILL HAVE TO NAVIGATE- THE- CONSTITUTIONAL HURDLES LIKE THE ONES THAT MISS KELLER MENTIONED. A CALIFORNIA IS ALSO FREE TO IMPOSE LIABILITY FOR TOPICS UNRELATED TO THE PUBLICATION THIRD PARTY CONTENT. SECTION TO THEIR DOES NOT PERMIT THE LEGISLATURE TO INDIRECTLY CHIEF WHAT IT CANNOT DO DIRECTLY. BUT WAS JUST FOR WAS A- ABOUT A DECADE AGO WITH YOU STATES I TRIED REGULATE THE- OF ONLINE AS FOR COME SEX. RATHER THE BAND THERE PUBLISHING DIRECTOR THE STATE'S REQUIRE AND THAT'S- TO VERIFY THAT A DEPICTED TO WERE ADULTS. AND UNLESS THIS INTERNET SERVICES DA. PROOF OF EACH AGE FOR. THE LOSS SAID THE SERVER HAVE THE RECORD C. A. FROM. A THREE TO COURTS STRUCK TO. THESE LAWS STUDENTS TWO. S. ONE CORTEX. THE LAW SCHOOL. IF THE LOG IT'S INCOMES WITH FACTS TWO THIRTY IT CRIMINALIZE THE NO PUBLIC. IS DISPLAY OF SPECIFIED CONTACT IN SO DOING IT CREATES AN INCENTIVE FOR ALL MY SERVICE ARE NOT TO MONITOR THE CONTENT THAT. THE SECTION TODAY WAS ENACTED TO REMEDY AND QUOTE. THAT'S A DIFFERENT WAY OF TRYING TO WORK AROUND SECTION TWO THIRTY SOME STATE LEGISLATURES HAVE BEEN INSPIRING QUOTE TRANSPARENCY OBLIGATIONS THAT REQUIRE AND SERVICES TO PUBLISH INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR EDITORIAL OPERATIONS SUCH AS PUBLISHING THEIR EDITORIAL POLICIES IN THEIR TERMS OF SERVICE OR STATISTICS ABOUT THEIR EDITORIAL DECISIONS. TO THE EXTENT THESE TRANSPARENCY OBLIGATIONS DO NOT RESTRICT THE INTERNET SERVICES DECISIONS ABOUT PUBLISHING THIRD PARTY CONTENT THAT SECTION TWO THIRTY MAY NOT ADDRESS THAT. NEVER LAST AND DISCARDED MENTION THIS- MANDATORY TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS ABOUT EDITORIAL OPERATIONS CAN RAISE SERIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEMS AND I DO HAVE A FORTHCOMING PAPER THAT LAYS OUT THESE CONCERNS WHICH I'M HAPPY JUST PASSED. IN THE CULINARY- RATHER THAN ATTEMPT A CONTROLLER SUPERVISE THE EDITORIAL DECISIONS OF INTERNET SERVICES THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE MIGHT CONSIDER HOW IT CONSULTED KIND OF PRO SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND HOPES TO SEE THREE POSSIBILITIES FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANTLY OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO TEACH STUDENTS HOW TO BE SMART AND CARING DIGITAL CITIZENS NO MATTER HOW MUCH INTEREST SERVICES ARE REGULATED WILL NEVER ACHIEVE THE KIND OF ONLINE WORLD WE WANT WITHOUT EDUCATING PEOPLE HOW TO BE GOOD COMMITTEE MEMBERS BOTH ONLINE AND OFF. SECOND THE LEGISLATURE FIND RESEARCH INTO BEST PRACTICES FOR BUILDING PRO SOCIAL ONLINE COMMUNITY. LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO HELP A VANDALIZED THE FINDINGS FROM THAT RESEARCH TO HELP UP WITH THE PRACTICES ACROSS THE BOARD. ESPECIALLY IF SPONSORS THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO DO THIS KIND OF RESEARCH THEMSELVES. FOR A THIRD IF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE BELIEVES THAT THE MARKET IS A PROVIDING US CONSTITUENTS WITH THE KIND OF INTERNET SERVICES- THAT IT WANTS THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER BUILDING AN OPERATIONS ON SERVICES. I'M GIVE ME ANALOGY GOVERNMENT PROVIDE PHYSICAL WORLD PARKS TO GIVE CITIZENS A PLACE TO PAY PLAY AND SOCIALIZE. THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE COULD CREATE A PUBLIC OFFICIAL PARKS TO PLAY A SIMILAR. PROSOCIAL WALL ONLINE. OKAY BY NOW THE AND OF THE LEGISLATURE CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE NEEDS OF THE START UP ECOSYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT CURRENT AND FUTURE ON TURNER'S CAN'T LAUNCH SERVICES THAT CAN OUT INNOVATE. AND OUT COMPETE THE EXISTING INTERNET INCUMBENTS. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY SURE THESE FROM THE MARCH SUNDAY- AND I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONVERSATION THANK YOU. I THANK YOU PROFESSOR GOLDMAN OF QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SENATE CORTESE. YES SIR THANK YOU MISTER HI. ASSEMBLY LISTENED AND TOOK COPIOUS NOTES SOME. HERE ROLLED WITH THE LAST TWO SPEAKERS PROFESSOR KELLERMANN AND PROFESSOR GOLDMAN WHAT IT CAN APPRECIATE. THE ENUMERATION OF THE ENUMERATION OF- YOU KNOW PROTECTING WHAT CAN AND CAN'T BE DONE. THE FIVE ITEMS SAID THE PROFESSOR KILLER LAID OUT. IT DIDN'T SEEM TO MENTION THOSE FIVE ITEMS PROTOCOLS OF ACTION- IN TERMS OF ANY CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES- FIVE RIGHT HANDER STEM THE FIVE HURDLES WERE REALLY. ELISE'S I'D LISTEN TO- COMING FROM A REGULATORY LANDS WHAT CAN YOU REGULATE WE CANNOT REGULATE BUT SHORT OF REGULATIONS. OF IN THE COURSE IS QUESTION COULD BE FOR PROFESSOR KILLER OR PROFESSOR GOLDMAN- IT'S I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER CONSTITUTIONALLY STRAIGHT UP CONSTITUTIONALLY OR THROUGH TWO THIRTY. WHETHER OR NOT IT'S YOUR OPINION. THAT THE CONGRESS IS ACTUALLY STEPPED INTO THE SEPARATION OF POWERS SPACE IT SAID THAT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH CONTROL LONGER. HARM CAN NO LONGER ADJUDICATE. I'M STATE. CLAIMS OF STATE RESIDENTS OF FOR SOME OF THE THINGS THAT FOLKS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE HE TOUCHED UPON HIM BY ALICIA PRIVACY RIGHTS- WURSTEN VIOLATION OF PRIVACY RIGHTS PERHAPS- TRAFFICKING OF. OF IMAGES OF MINORS IN. COMPROMISING SITUATIONS. AND SO I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND- YOU BECAUSE I DID HER PRESS RIGGLEMAN SAY THE CONGRESS LEFT THE CENTER LEFT NO ROOM FOR PRIVATE PARTIES TWO HE SAID HE LOOKED AT CONGRESS LEFT ROOM FOR PRIVATE PARTIES TO BE TO MAKE CIVIL CLAIMS. BUT KEPT FIFTY CENTURY THAT JURISDICTION TO THEMSELVES WHAT WILL CONGRESS. IS DOES NOT HAVE JUDICIAL POWERS SO I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. AGAIN A PICTURE POSITION THE. THE KIND OF LEGISLATION THAT STATES TYPICALLY A DEAL WITH IN TERMS OF CIVIL CLAIMS QUANTIFYING PENALTIES OR REMEDIES OR DAMAGES- OR CIVIL PROCEDURE AROUND WHEN. HUMP WHEN IT CAME COULD BE BROUGHT. HOME HEALTH THINGS LIKE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF HI- HIM- ARE ARE. HOME INSTALLED INVINCIBLE PROCEDURE AROUND CERTAIN KINDS OF CLAIMS YOU KNOW THESE ARE ALL AREAS UNDER THE JURISDICTION. TYPICALLY OF STATES TO ALLOW THEIR RESIDENTS HELLO TO BRING CLAIMS FORD FOR DAMAGES AND I'M JUST NOT CLEAR ON. AGAIN A WHAT YOUR OPINION IS AS TO. OUR ABILITY TO DO THAT- REQUIRING- ONCE NOTICE HAS BEEN ONCE AGAIN INTERNET. A POPCORN HAS BEEN PUT ON NOTICE- THAT. HELLO THERE'S AN ALLEGED VIOLATION FROM A SIMPLE STANDPOINT- WHAT REMEDIES ARE AVAILABLE IF THEY DON'T CARE IN IN IN I GUESS WHAT I'M ASKING ONE MORE TIME IS ARE YOU SAYING NONE- FINANCIAL JUST WONDERING HOW HOW THAT'S CONSTITUTIONAL. THANK YOU SECRETARY ZINKE OF. MISS KELLER MAYBE I CAN SPEAK TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL CASE- AND PROFESSOR GOLDMAN CAN SPEAK TO THAT SORT OF TWO THIRTY LEGISLATIVE NEEDS AS A CONSTITUTIONAL MATTER- LAWS THAT CREATE A PRIVATE CAUSE OF ACTION ARE LIMITED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU KNOW DIRECT FEDERAL PROSECUTION OF REGULATION WOULD BE SO IF YOU THINK FOR EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING LIKE- THE FAMOUS NEW YORK TIMES VERSUS SULLIVAN DEFAMATION CASE WHERE THAT THE SUPREME COURT SAID BECAUSE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT WE HAVE TO PLACE THESE LIMITS ON HOW EASY IT IS TO BRING A DEFAMATION CLAIM AGAINST THE NEWSPAPER- TALKING ABOUT A PUBLIC FIGURE. THAT WAS ABOUT EIGHT I BELIEVE THIS ALABAMA STATE DEFAMATION CAUSE OF ACTION- AND THE POINTS OF THAT RULING AND MANY OTHER BUILDINGS IS THAT ULTIMATELY THE CONSTITUTION IS A IS A CONSTRAINT ON THE STATE CAUSES OF ACTION WHEN THEY RUN INTO CONFLICT WITH FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS SO THAT THAT'S- PART OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL PIECE UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT- AND THEN THE OTHER PIECE OF THE QUESTION I THINK AND THIS MIGHT BE SOMETHING ERA CAN SPEAK TO MORE- IS ABOUT. CONGRESS STEPPING IN AND PREVENTING STATES FROM CREATING CAUSES OF ACTION YOU KNOW CITING THE FIRST AMENDMENT ASIDE ASSUMING THAT THOSE CAUSES OF ACTION- ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRST AMENDMENT- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS CONGRESS'S ROLE IN IN DISPLACING ABOUT THREE SETTING CONSISTENT NATIONWIDE RULES AND THAT ARE YOU KNOW GOES BACK MORE TO THE COMMERCE CLAUSE AND SHOOT THE POWERS THAT CONGRESS HAS EXERCISED IN SETTING UP FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS LAW GENERALLY FEDERAL LAW FOR BROADCAST FOR CABLE. AND COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT'S SO CALLED CDA TWO THIRTY- AS AS ERIC SPOKE TO- THERE IS THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE I'VE WRITTEN ABOUT YOU KNOW IF THERE WERE NO TWO THIRTY THEN THERE WOULD BE FIRST AMENDMENT LIMITS TO WHAT. OUR LIABILITY COULD BE PUT ON TOP REYES AND HOW BACK WORK- YOU KNOW THAT THE IS AGAIN WE KNOW THIS FROM THE CASE ABOUT OF SAN. AND AND FOR OTHER CASE. AND IT'S THAT NO CLASS COULD BE LIKE IN WE KNOW NOW THAT FORM SPACE LIABILITY FOR. UNDER FEDERAL CRIMINAL LAW JUST LIKE ANYBODY ELSE DOES FOR EXAMPLE FOR THINGS LIKE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL. IT IS RATHER THAT YOU CAN'T DESIGN LAWS THAT FORESEEABLY ARE GOING TO HAVE THIS HUGE COLLATERAL DAMAGE AFFECT WITH PLATFORMS TAKING DOWN A BUNCH OF LAWFUL SPEECH ARE POTENTIALLY DOING SO USING TOOLS THAT. VIOLATE USERS PRIVACY USING TOOLS LIKE- HATE SPEECH FOLK SO CALLED HATE SPEECH VOTERS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE DISPARATE IMPACT ON BLACK AMERICAN ENGLISH SPEAKERS YEAH THEY'RE JUST A BUNCH OF- COLLATERAL DAMAGE CONSTRAINTS YOU HAVE TO START CONTROLLING FOR- AND THAT THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES CONTROLLING FOR ONCE YOU'RE- OUTSIDE. THE CURRENT WORLD OF CD EIGHT T. THIRTY. THANK YOU PAUL SURE ALL OF THE THREE TOUR AND I THINK FILL- SOME THINGS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A REGULATORY. FOR CONTENT. REGULATION STRAIGHT UP PER SE WHAT I'M REALLY ASKING HIS- WHETHER NOT YOU'RE SAYING. IS THAT CONGRESS HAS ESSENTIALLY USURPED THE RIGHT OF PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL TO BRING- THE CLAIM FOR A REQUEST FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ON SOMETHING LIKE FOR TRAFFICKING IN IN CON. IMAGES OF CHILDREN. ONCE IT'S ALREADY BEEN PUBLISHED IT'S AN M. WALLETS ON GOING. BEING PUBLISHED AS PART OF THE PLATFORM WHERE THE HARM IS OCCURRING EVERY SECOND OF EVERY DAY FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS TODAY AND TOMORROW AND THE NEXT DAY. YOU SEEM TO BE SAYING THAT. CONGRESS HAS RESERVE TO ITSELF. THE RIGHT TO CREATE REMEDIES OR NOT- HUH FOR A PATH FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF TO GET THE- IMAGE TAKEN DOWN. IN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE THEY'RE IN AND OF ITSELF AS TO WHETHER OR NOT CONGRESS UNDER UNDER. A SEPARATION OF POWERS HAS A RIGHT TO GO IN AND PRECLUDE. I'M A CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. OF FOR BRINGING A CLAIM. HI TO PROTECT THEMSELVES OR THEIR THEIR OWN CHILDREN. FROM TRAFFICKING ONLINE TRAFFICKING THAT'S ONGOING- FOR WORK YOU SEEM TO BE SAYING IS. THAT THE PARENT OR GUARDIAN. OR THE COUNSELOR THEREFORE WOULD WOULD HAVE TO SIT ON THEIR HANDS IN AND WAIT FOR POLARIZED CONGRESS. HI TO COME FORWARD WITH THOSE REMEDIES WHICH THEY HAVE YET TO DO. MAINTENANCE AND I'M HAVING A HARD TIME WITH THE LATTER SCENARIO. IN OF ITSELF BEING CONSTITUTIONAL I DON'T THINK THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH COULD DO THAT EITHER I THINK THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION- IS CREATES A SEPARATE. BECAUSE OF ACTION NOTE WHETHER OR NOT THE CAUSE OF ACTION- WHAT DO NOT THAT PLEASE THAT PLEASE WOULD BE UPHELD BY THE COURT. HUNDREDS BASED ON FACTS WERE BASED ON TWO THIRTY- I THINK IS A IS A DIFFERENT ISSUE BUT WHAT I'M HEARING YOU SAYING THESE. LEGISLATURE CANNOT CREATE THE CAUSE OF ACTION IN THE FIRST PLACE IN HAVE COMMANDED A HARD TIME WITH. SPEAK BRIEFLY TO THAT I THINK ERIC'S SORT OF IS THE RIGHT PERSON FOR MOST OF THE ANSWER BUT I MEAN ONE PIECE IS THAT STATE LEGISLATURES ABSOLUTELY CAN AND DO CREATE CAUSES OF ACTION AGAINST PLATFORMS. UP FOR THINGS THAT ARE NOT ABOUT THE SPEECH TRANSMITTED BY THE PLATFORM'S USERS SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE SEVERAL RECENT- CASES ON CD TWO THIRTY- SAYING IT BETTER CLAIM CAN PROCEED FOR EXAMPLE- AGAINST SNAP. BASED ON A BAD PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT SNAP ITSELF WAS GENERATING OR AGAINST AIRBNB- BASED ON- TRANSACTIONS AND LOCAL HOUSING REGULATION- BUT- WHERE THE CLAIM IS BASED ON SPEECH THAT USERS POST TO PLATFORMS THAT DOES MOVE INTO THE SPACE THAT CONGRESS HAS OCCUPIED. THROUGH ITS CDA TWO THIRTY NOW FOR THE SPECIFIC ISSUE THAT YOU'RE BRINGING UP THE TRAFFICKING CLAIMS. THERE WAS A- CHANGE TO THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THROUGH THAT SESTA FOSTA LEGISLATION THAT WAS INTENDED TO TARGET PRECISELY THAT AND WHICH DID OPEN UP ROOM FOR ADDITIONAL CLAIMS- THAT HADN'T EXISTED BEFORE. AND I SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR WITH YOU THAT I AM INVOLVED IN A CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE TO SESTA FOSTA I THINK THAT- BEAT MERRICK'S. CHALLENGE HAVE BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENCE AS THE YEARS HAVE GONE BY SINCE THE LAW PASSED AS THERE IS INCREASING EVIDENCE OF BAD LAWS FAILURE TO ACHIEVE ITS PURPOSES IN AND THE INCREASE IN RISK AND HARMS TO- TAKE PEOPLE. INVOLVED IN COMMERCIAL SEX WORK SO I DO THINK THERE'S GREAT COMPLEXITY IN WHAT A CONSTITUTIONAL LAW COULD LOOK LIKE ON THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE BUT I THINK THAT IS. YOU KNOW OFF TO THE SIDE AND I'M NOT THE SAME AS THE QUESTION YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT THE ROLE OF THAT FEDERAL LEGISLATURE VERSUS THE STATE LEGISLATURES- ERIC DO. YOU WANT TO SPEAK MORE TO THIS ONE. BUT WITH THE CHURCH. ASSURE YEAH THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER FOR REYES- THE ISSUE AND ASKING I THINK SERIES OF IN QUESTIONS- EVERY OTHER FOCUSED ON SEX TWO THIRTY I THINK BESTSELLERS OR TALKED SOME OF THE- LIMITS- TRUCKS TWO THIRTY APPLY TO. ALL THE DIFFERENT WAYS WHICH A MIGHT BE STRUCTURE WHETHER IT'S AS A- A SAID REACHED WITH DAMAGE AS A SIMPLE RESTRICTION WITH- IN. RELIEF AVAILABLE A SECTION TWO THIRTY APPLIES TO ALL THE DIFFERENT WAYS TO WHICH- THE LIABILITY MIGHT ATTACH- THAT TO BE CLEAR AND WE DO NEED TO REITERATE ITS SECTION TWO THIRTY DOESN'T RESTRICT ANY CLAIMS AGAINST ACTUAL WRONG TO WORKERS. CAUSING THE HARM TO CHOOSE- REFERENCED- DOES NEVER BEEN COVERED BY SECTION TWO THIRTY SO WE'RE ONLY TALKING NOW ABOUT THE INTERMEDIARY SERVICES LIABILITY- AND IN THAT SECTION TO HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT THINGS LIKE NOTICE AND TAKEDOWN I SCHEMES ARE ARE INCONSISTENT WITH SECTION TWO THIRTIES PROHIBITIONS- SO- THE FACT THAT NOTICES MIGHT WORK IN OTHER CONTEXTS SAY THE COPPERY CONTACTS- THAT DOESN'T TRANSLATE INTO THE SECTION TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT. THERE HAVE BEEN OCCASIONAL CHALLENGES TO THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SECTION TWO THIRTY THERE ARE BELIEVE PENDING CHARGES- IN COURT TODAY- THOSE CHALLENGES HAVE GONE GONE ANYWHERE- I THINK THAT THIS IS FAIRLY WITHIN CONGRESS'S. AUTHORITY ON TO US STRUCTURE OF THE KIND OF- SPEECH ENVIRONMENT SAID IT WANTS AND THAT'S SINCE WHEN I THINK ABOUT SECTION TWO THERE IS A SUPPLEMENT TO THE FIRST AMENDMENT THE FIRST AMENDMENT SAYS THE FLOOR ABOUT THE TIME DISTRICTS FROM IT IN OUR SOCIETY. BUT CONGRESS CAN AND IN SOME CASES HIGHS AHEAD DOCTORS SPEECH ENHANCING LAWS AND YOU MIGHT LOOK AT SECTIONS THERE IS IN THAT CATEGORY WITHIN CONGRESS'S PURVIEW TO DO SO- THE LAST. I'M JUST GONNA MENTION ABOUT- PRIOR RIGHTS OF ACTION WE SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THE POSSIBILITY THAT- PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTION WOULD BE- BROUGHT IF ENABLED I JUST FEEL THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE IN HUMAN HISTORY- AND IN PARTICULAR- THE LOSS IN FLORIDA ANTI X. I HAVE INCLUDED. RIGHTS ACTION FOR. CONTENT MODERATION DECISION. FOR SERVICE THAT MAKES BILLION TO. A DAY ABOUT CONTENT IN THEORY EACH PERSON TO GET WHAT THEY WANT- THAT TO SEE TO FOR LIKE THIS SERVICE TODAY UNDER. THE PURSE. IF IT HAD PLAN OF WE COULD LIVE. BILLIONS OF LAWSUITS. PER DAY- AND I DON'T KNOW THE WORK. TO HANDLE THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT A SOLUTION BEYOND ABOUT ENVIRONMENT. THANK YOU PROFESSOR GOLDMAN OTHER COMPANY HAS CENTER STERN. THANKS IS CHAIR WE DROVE DOWN ON ON ONE UNDERLYING POINT AROUND THE FIRST AMENDMENT I THINK MIGHT BE HELPFUL FOR FRAMING THE CONVERSATION I- THE IRAQ IT GETS AT THE ALSO THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS IN SECTION TWO THIRTY BUT- TO BE CLEAR. CERTAIN KINDS OF SPEECH ARE NOT PROTECTED WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE SPEECH THE A POOR INTER AWFUL SPEECH THAT IS LAWFUL- BUT- THREATS OF VIOLENCE. ARE NOT CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED- I CAN CAN YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE IN IN JUST IN THAT PARTICULAR CONTEXT- WHAT CONSTITUTES- AT BOND AB RIGHT SPEECH THAT ISN'T CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED IN THAT CONTEXT. WHAT KIND OF THREAT IT HAS TO BE TO BE CONSIDERED- UNPROTECTED SPEECH. SO I CAN SPEAK TO THIS I MEAN THAT THE- UNDERLYING- BRANDENBURG STANDARD FROM THE SUPREME COURT INVOLVES ASKING QUITE THERE THE THREATS CREATES AN IMMINENT RISK OF HARM- AND- I AM I AM NOT AN EXPERT IN THE DETAILS OF THAT SORT OF SUBSEQUENT CASE LAW INTERPRETING THAT BUT SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS REALLY RELEVANT FOR. THIS DISCUSSION AND WHICH I THOUGHT ABOUT A GREAT DEAL IS YOU KNOW THE IDEA THAT EIGHT THE RATS THAT IS LEGAL WHEN MADE MAYBE IN A BAR BECAUSE NOBODY BELIEVES THE SPEAKER'S GOING TO ACT ON IT MIGHT BECOME ILLEGAL ARE CONSTITUTIONALLY PERMISSIBLE TO RESTRICT WHEN DISSEMINATED ON THE INTERNET IN A WAY THAT MIGHT LEAD TO MOB VIOLENCE OR LEAD TO- I'M MENTALLY UNSTABLE PEOPLE THE PERSON BEING MOTIVATED BAITED BY IT AND TAKING ACTION. THERE'S A PROFESSOR NAMED LARISSA LET'S SEE WHO'S WHO'S WRITTEN REALLY. ON ON THIS QUESTION- AND I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS. MAYBE I. GOT TO BOTTOM LINE AND I APOLOGIZE BUT- I THINK IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT AND SORT OF CASE BY CASE BASIS- COURTS COULD LOOK AT INSTANCES OF ONLINE THREATS- AND- RESTRICT THE MORE THAN THEY MIGHT HAVE RESTRICTED THAT THREAT IN A BAR ROOMS. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT TRANSLATES TO IT LIKE A CONSTITUTIONALLY PERMISSIBLE STRUCTURE WHERE- PLATFORMS WRITTEN LARGE ARE REQUIRED TO PROHIBIT A WHOLE CLASS OF SPEECH THAT CURRENTLY LEGAL YOU KNOW BEFORE WE MOVE THE LINE FROM WHAT THE LAW PROHIBIT RIGHT NOW. YES WHICH IS WHAT THE U. K. IS TRYING TO SPEND THAT KIND OF THING AND WHEN I HEARD MY COLLEAGUES TALK ABOUT SPECIFIC INSTANCES OF INJURIES OF KNOWN YOU KNOW ONGOING INCIDENTS AYE I THINK OF YOU KNOW. AT A PUBLIC OFFICIAL FOR INSTANCE GIVING A SPEECH IN A PARK AND- PEOPLE IN THAT PARK- THREATENING AT PUBLIC OFFICIALS LIFE NOT SAYING YOU KNOW. KICK THIS GUY OUT OF OFFICE BUT LET'S GO GET THIS GUY- THAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IS. UNPROTECTED SPEECH AND IT CAN BE YOU CAN BE RELIABLE FOR ASSAULTER AMONGST A NUMBER OF OTHER CRIMINAL CHARGES BUT WE DON'T HAVE. NECESSARILY THE SAME STANDARD ONLINE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T ALWAYS FIND THE PERSON WHO'S MAKING THAT THREAT. AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE SORT OF ANONYMOUS THREATS OR ANONYMOUS POSTINGS IN THAT WAY THE LIABILITY FRAMEWORK SHIFTS AND. YEAH I THINK. IT DID BUT BUT NEVER THE CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS ON- OUR ABILITY TO REGULATE THAT KIND OF SPEECH JUST TO BE CLEAR TODAY DO NOT SOUND PRESCRIBED. I APPRECIATE THE POINTS ABOUT COMMERCE BUT MY- MY MAKING THAT. BY MAKING THAT DISTINCTION PROPERLY HERE. AT LEAST IN THEORY. EIGHT IF I UNDERSTAND THAT THE QUESTION CORRECTLY I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW EVERY FIRST AMENDMENT QUESTION IS THIS PROTRACTED CASE BY CASE ANALYSIS ARE YOU KNOW EVERYTHING THAT'S IN A GRAY AREA- IT IS RESULT CASE BY CASE BY COURTS AND SO- I DON'T THINK WE HAVE. YOU KNOW I GO TO THE THING THAT TELLS US EXACTLY WHAT SPEECH IS LEGAL OR ILLEGAL IN IN WHAT CONTEXT DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION OR I APOLOGIZE I MEAN IT'S HARD BECAUSE IT IF YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND A FRAMEWORK LIKE YOU SAID YOU DON'T TO DO CLASS BASED REGULATION OF ALL ONE TYPE OF CONTENT BUT AT LEAST THAT. CLARIFICATION FOR WHAT COULD BE PROSECUTED IN THEORY ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS RIGHT TO THAT D. A. EASIER CITY ATTORNEYS OR- YOU KNOW LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS THAT THE PUBLIC COULD ACTUALLY SEEK RECOURSE FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT RIGHT FOR. FOR POTENTIAL CLAIMS NOT JUST IN PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BUT IN CRIMINAL. CASES IT SOUNDS LIKE. IF PEOPLE THINK ANYTHING GOES ONLINE. AND I THINK WE PASSED A LAW HERE IN THE SENATE ELECTIONS. COMMITTEE AT TWO YEARS BACK THAT MADE IT CRIMINAL NOT JUST TO PUT FOR INSTANCE MISINFORMATION ABOUT AN ELECTION- INTO SOMEONE'S MAILBOX BUT ALSO TO TWEAK THAT INFORMATION. RIGHT AND THAT THAT ACT ITSELF WITH A WAS OTHERWISE A VIOLATION OF STATE ELECTION LAW RIGHT TO PUT OUT MISINFORMATION ABOUT ELECTION IN DELIBERATELY INTENDED TO DEFRAUD A VOTER. ID THAT THAT'S THE CONTENT OF THAT SPEECH IS NOT CHANGE JUST BECAUSE IT'S BEEN TWEETED AS OPPOSED TO- PUT IN SOMEONE'S MAILBOX ON A POSTER AND SO. I GUESS I'M JUST I'M WRESTLING WITH. HOW TO PROVIDE MORE CLARITY IN LAW ABOUT THOSE BOUNDARIES OR LACK THERE OF IN THAT IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE WE HAVE NOT BEEN CHALLENGED CONSTITUTIONALLY THERE. MISS KELLER PROFESSOR GOLDMAN YOU CAN RESPOND. WELL DO WE LOSE THE. EACH OTHER WHO'S GOING TO GO FOR PLEASE COME I HAVE A FEW THAT MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO PLEASE. GET OUT OF SO I MEAN FOR I WOULD SAY. I THINK THERE'S A NAY FOR MORE RESEARCH AND A- TOWARD YOU KNOW WHEN THERE'S SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS WHO IS A- THEM ONLINE YOU HAS THE STOCK FOR X. IS BEING- HAVING. WEEDS FOR THEM TO GET SUPPORT- FROM POLICE- AND YOU KNOW AND SO FORTH IT IS IMPORTANT WAY FORWARD I WOULD STATE IN PARTICULARLY. WHEN THIS IS SORT OF LIKE AN UGLY TRUTH ABOUT THE CONTENT MODERATION WORLD FOR CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL THERE ARE. MASSIVELY IN ADEQUATE FEDERAL RESOURCES- IN CASE OF WHAT PLATFORMS DO REMOVE THIS CONTENT AND REPORT IT TO FEDERAL AUTHORITIES AND THAT NO ACTION IS TAKEN. I THINK IN THE WORLD OF GOING YOU KNOW HOLDING SPEAKERS LIABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS THERE THERE IS ROOM FOR MOTION- THAT SAID I'M I DIDN'T. PUT IN MIND OF A SUPREME COURT CASE FROM A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO CALLED ALONENESS- WHICH WAS- PROSECUTING A MAN WHO POSTED THREATS TO HIS EX WIFE ON FACEBOOK- INCLUDE IN THE FORM OF RAP LYRICS AND- BEING COLLUDED THINGS. LIKE AND PARAPHRASING BUT- FULL UP THAT TEMPER RISK ORDER PUT IT IN EUROPE. DO YOU THINK IT WILL STOP A BULLET- AND STATEMENTS ABOUT- GOING AND SHOOTING PEOPLE AT SCHOOLS REALLY REALLY SCARY YOU KNOW AS A PARENT. REALLY SCARY STUFF AND THE SUPREME COURT SAID NO IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL TO PROSECUTE THIS GUY FOR SAYING THESE THINGS AND SO THE LIMITS. YOU KNOW ON WHAT. BUT THE LIMITS THERE ARE ARE DIFFICULT. I'LL JUST ADD- THAT- THE CIRCUMSTANCES ABOUT WIND SOME STATEMENT ONLINE IT CONSTITUTES A TRUE THREAT- THAT SIGNALS A PANIC IMMINENT ACTIONS THAT SUPPORT CRIMINAL PROSECUTION IS REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE AND I THINK YOUR ANALOGY ABOUT- WHAT SOME MIGHT SAY IN A PARK- TO SOMEONE IN PHYSICAL SPACE- THERE'S AN IMMINENT- POSSIBILITY OF VIOLENCE IS THE PEOPLE ARE PHYSICALLY IN THE SAME SPACE TOGETHER- THAT ISN'T SHOWING THE ONLINE WORLD- AND SO- WHAT. WHENEVER WE SEE THAT LEVEL OF EMINENCE THE NUMBER ONE RECOURSE ALWAYS HAS TO BE WHAT IS LAW ENFORCEMENT IN A JUNE TO PROTECT THE TARGETS OF THIS- POTENTIALLY IMMINENT VIOLENCE- AND IF WE THINK THE LAW ENFORCEMENT STOP TAKING THOSE CASES IF WE THINK THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO TAKE CARE OF THEM THEN I THINK WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT ON THOSE TERMS. BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS VERY MUCH HAND CUFFED IN THIS AREA BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT SPEAKERS HAVE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS TO ESPOUSE ARE VIEWED SEN SO THE EXAMPLE THAT MISS TAYLOR GAVE ABOUT THESE RAP LYRICS BEING QUOTED THAT COULD VERY WELL BE THE KIND OF THING THAT STARTS TO VIRGIN TO FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTED. SPEECH AND LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN BE PARALYZED BY THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE TO GET A RIGHT THEY HAVE TO- ABOUT PROTECT- CITIZENS FROM VIOLENCE BUT THEY ALSO HAVE TO RESPECT THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS TO SPEAKERS- SO I THINK THERE'S NO EASY SOLUTIONS HERE IN PART BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THIS WILL ALWAYS BE FACT SPECIFIC AND THE FACT THAT THINGS ARE TAKING PLACE ONLINE REDUCES THE LIKELIHOOD OF SOME IMMINENT VIOLENCE IN A WAY THAT MAY NOT BE TRUE. IF PEOPLE ARE JUST ARE LEGALLY WITH AND- YOU KNOW THE SWINGING RADIUS OF THEIR FEST- HAVING SAID THAT THOUGH- IF WE THINK THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMITMENT TO THIS ISSUE I THINK WE. NEED TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE ON ITS OWN TERMS. THANK YOU ARM. DOES THE FOLLOWING TO SEND CORTEZ. QUESTION SO THE EASING EXAM FROM A VERY OLD CASE. IF ARM. AN INDIVIDUAL POSTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA HEY EVERYBODY COME TO THE ABC THEATRE AND MIDWAY THROUGH THE SHOW OR CONCERT. YELL FIRE. AND THAT BECOMES A TREND THAT BECOMES A THING AND- SOMEONE TRIES TO ENJOYING THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM FROM POP PROMULGATING THIS ACTIVITY- ISRAELI BE DONE CAN THEY BE ENJOINED. I'LL START WITH MISS KELLER THAT'LL TURN TO PROFESSOR GOLDMAN. I'LL. SETTING ASIDE THE MUCH INTERNET DEBATED QUESTION ABOUT THE SPEECH IN A CROWDED THEATER EXAMPLE- I THINK YOU KNOW THE CORE OF THIS QUESTION IS IF THERE ARE PEOPLE ORGANIZING DANGEROUS THINGS ON ON A PLATFORM- WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT BASS WHAT LIABILITY CAN BE IMPOSED ON THEM I'M NOT THEM IF THEY ARE ORGANIZING SOMETHING THAT WILL FORESEEABLY YOU KNOW BECAUSE REAL WORLD VIOLENCE AND DAMAGING- AND- THERE'S AN ACADEMIC THEM SUSAN BENESCH WHO HAS WHAT I THINK IS A REALLY USEFUL FRAMEWORK FOR THIS. I WAS BECAUSE THAT DANGEROUS SPEECH LOOKING LIKE VERY INCORRECTLY AT WHAT SPEECH FORESEEABLY- IS LIKELY TO LEAD TO REAL WORLD VIOLENCE- I THINK AGAIN SORT OF TO GO BACK TO THE POINTS THAT BET ERIC AND I WERE BOTH RAISING AND- IN RESPONSE TO THE PREVIOUS SET OF QUESTIONS. THE CONSTITUTIONAL THRESHOLD FOR PLAN- I'M LAWS CAN ACT BECAUSE IT LOOKS REALLY REALISTIC THAT SOMETHING REALLY DANGEROUS IS GOING TO HAPPEN VERY SOON- THOSE. ARE VERY VERY HIGH- AND THEN BEYOND THAT IF THE IDEA IS TO PUT THE RESPONSIBILITY ON THE FACEBOOK- OR TWITTER OR YOUTUBE TO IDENTIFY WHEN PARTICULAR SPEECH HAS REACHED THAT THRESHOLD. WHERE IT COULD IN FACT BE LEGALLY PROHIBITED- IT IS. UNREALISTIC I THINK TO EXPECT THAT THEY WILL DO A GOOD JOB THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE I THINK WE CAN PREDICT WITH COMPLETE CERTAINTY THAT THEY WILL DO WHAT THEY DO IN RESPONSE TO THINGS LIKE COPYRIGHT TAKEDOWN NOTICES WHICH IS JUST TO ERR. VASTLY ON THE SIDE OF TAKING DOWN MORE CONTENT THAN THE LAW REQUIRES- AND WE MIGHT YOU KNOW TAKING OFF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER HACKS AND PUTTING ON. YOU KNOW FOR THE PUBLIC. HATS WE MIGHT SAY THAT'S FINE. WHAT THE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT CONSTANT PROTECTED SPEECH- BUT AP YOU KNOW THAT THE LAW ISN'T ALLOWED TO TAKE OFFICE CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER HAT- BUT B. YOU KNOW I THINK UNDER THOSE STANDARDS YOU WOULD LOSE BOTH- RIGHT WING AND LEFT WING PROTESTS YOU WOULD LOSE. PRO TRUMP HOPE PROTESTS AND BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTEST YOU WOULD LOSE- POLITICAL ACTIVITY. ARE POTENTIALLY FROM ALL ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM AND REALLY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO ORGANIZE ONLINE WHICH SEEMS APPEALING IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ORGANIZING ONLINE OR OR THINK THEY'RE DANGEROUS- AND DISTURBING. IF YOU THINK IT IS AN IMPORTANT EXERCISE OF RIGHTS AND POLITICAL PARTICIPATION THE ABILITY OF PLATFORMS IF THEY'RE GIVEN THAT THE OBLIGATION OF FIGURING OUT WHICH IS WHICH THEY THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GET THAT RIGHT WHATEVER YOU THINK RIGHT IS YOU KNOW WHATEVER ONE THINKS RIGHT AS THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET IT RIGHT- THEY WILL JUST ERR ON THE SIDE OF TAKING DOWN. A LOT. SO BUT THAT THAT'S NOT QUITE MY QUESTION MY QUESTION IS. IT IMAGINE IF WE ENACT A LAW THAT SAYS WHEN YOU. HAVE KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A- A RISK OF SERIOUS DANGER- AND YOUR INFORMED YOU'RE THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM YOUR TOLD HEY. YOU KNOW PEOPLE AGAIN USING THE EXAMPLE PEOPLE ARE NOW SHOUTING FIRES IN SHOUTING FIRE IN THEATERS. AND WE THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE THAT DOWN IF YOU DON'T TAKE THAT DOWN. THEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE HELD CIVILLY LIABLE I THINK YOUR ANSWER IS WE CAN'T. THE RIGHT. I THINK UNDER CITY A TWO THIRTY YOU CAN'T- I HAD I THINK UNDER THE AND THAT YOU KNOW AS ERIC MENTIONED THERE AS BECAUSE OF ALL THE MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE CASES THAT THAT SPEAKS OF THIS THE IDEA OF YOU KNOW NOTICE SPACE THE LIABILITY OR TAKING THINGS DOWN WHEN YOU KNOW ABOUT IT- AND COURTS HAVE HAVE REJECTED THE IMPOSITION OF THAT KIND OF LIABILITY. UNDER CDA TWO THIRTY THEN YOU KNOW SETTING TO THIRTY ASIDE IF THIS IS PURELY A FIRST AMENDMENT QUESTION- I THINK ULTIMATELY WOULD HINGE ON WHAT KIND OF KNOWLEDGE- CAN REASONABLY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE PLATFORM IF WE HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE WE THINK PLATFORMS CAN RELIABLY AND ACCURATELY KNOW WHAT SPEECH IS ACTUALLY ILLEGAL AND ACT AGAINST THAT SPEECH. THAT PUSHES YOU CLOSER TO BEING IN THE WORLD OF A LAW THAT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED NARROWLY TALORED ENOUGH TO. YOU KNOW. TO ACHIEVE A COMPELLING INTEREST WITHOUT HAVING A BUNCH OF COLLATERAL DAMAGE IF INSTEAD OR IF YOU'RE A CO PRODUCTION IS THAT PLATFORMS WON'T HAVE THAT ABILITY TO DO A GOOD JOB DISCERNING. LEGAL SPEECH FROM ILLEGAL SPEECH AND YOU KNOW ACTING ACCORDINGLY THAT GETS YOU FARTHER AWAY FROM THE WORLD OF YOU KNOW WHAT CONCEIVABLY A COURT CONSIDER COULD CONSIDER TO BE NARROWLY TAILORED- AND THIS IS KIND OF THE LESSON OF THIS MYTH PERSISTS CALIFORNIA CASE THAT I MENTIONED. IT SAID YOU CAN'T HAVE STRICT LIABILITY BECAUSE YOU CANNOT ASSUME THAT A BOOKSELLER IS GOING TO GO OUT AND READ EVERYTHING ON ITS SHELVES AND THEN THE QUESTION IS OKAY AND YOU KNOW AT WHAT POINT TERM. KNOWING OR BEING CAPABLE OF KNOWING ABOUT ILLEGAL ACTION CAN YOU IMPOSE LIABILITY THE CLOSEST WE HAVE TO AN INTERNET CASE ON THIS AS A DISTRICT COURT CASE FROM THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS CALLED CDTV PACK HURTS. IT STRUCK DOWN A I THINK PENNSYLVANIA LAW THAT WAS REQUIRING ISPS. TO TAKE DOWN- TRULY HORRIFIC CONTENT TO TAKE ON- A BLOCK SEX ABUSE. BUT THE LAW WAS DRAFTED IN A WAY THAT THE COURT SAID FOR SIMPLY WAS GOING TO BE THE I ASK YOU TO GO OUT AND WALK A BUNCH OF INNOCUOUS CONTENT TO. AND SO IT WAS STRUCK DOWN ON THOSE PHONES. ALREADY THANK YOU- I APPRECIATE IT AND AN UNFORTUNATE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANEL- BUT MISS KELLER AND- PROFESSOR GOLDMAN QUITE- INFORMATIVE. ALL RIGHT. NEXT WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ASSESSING THE PROBLEM. THIS PANEL ASSESSED THE PROBLEMS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MORE DETAIL OUR FIRST SPEAKER DAVE'S A FREE- IS THEY SUFFER YOU MISTER SURFER IS THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CENTER FOR. TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY AT THE ANTI DEFAMATION LEAGUE KNOWN AS THE DL HIS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN THE TECH SECTOR INCLUDING. FOUNDING MULTIPLE START UPS AND SERVING IN EXECUTIVE ROLES AT OTHER ESTABLISHED TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES- AFTER. MISTER SEA FREE THEN- SOPHIE CHONG- THE- FORMER DATA SCIENTIST. AT OF FACEBOOK WELL WILL TESTIFY SHE PREVIOUSLY TESTIFIED BEFORE THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT. AND THE THIRD AND FINAL SPEAKER. FOR THIS PANEL IS. DR SYLVIA CHAU. DOCTOR SHOW IS THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR OF THE HEALTH COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATICS RESEARCH BRANCH AT THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE. SHE'S LED A NUMBER OF NIH INITIATIVES ON THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL MEDIA IN VARIOUS AREAS OF HEALTH. IS MORE THAN FIFTY SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS MANY WHICH BEEN DOCUMENTED. MANY OF WHICH HAVE DOCUMENTED HEALTH RELATED INTERNET USE AND ITS IMPACT. ON INDIVIDUALS. SO LET LET US BEGIN WITH MR FREE. ARE YOU AVAILABLE. I AM CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU PERFECTLY. EXCELLENT MISTER CHAIRMAN VICE CHAIR ABOARD HIS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING- MY NAME IS DAVID SEPARATE AND I SERVED AS VICE PRESIDENT OF MEDIAL CENTER FOR TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY AND IT'S MY PLEASURE TO SPEAK TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY ABOUT THE URGENT NEED TO ADDRESS EXTREMISM AND RADICALIZATION THAT OCCURS ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY DEALS MISSION HAS BEEN TO STOP THE DEFAMATION OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE AND TO SECURE JUSTICE AND FAIR TREATMENT TO ALL. WE ARE A LEADING VOICE IN FIGHTING HATE IN ALL FORMS. MY TEAM AT EDL WORKS TO PROTECT VICTIMS AND TARGETS OF ONLINE HE AND TO HOLD SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS AND DELIBERATE INACTION. IN FOSTERING HATE AND FERMENTING EXTREMISM AND VIOLENCE. WE PUBLISH DATA DRIVEN APPLIED RESEARCH BILL TECHNICAL TOOLS THAT MEASURE AND ANALYZE IDENTITY BASED ONLINE HATE. AND PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO POLICYMAKERS FOR CREATING A SAFER AND MORE EQUITABLE INTERNET. BEFORE ADL IN TWENTY NINETEEN I SPENT MY CAREER IS AN ENTREPRENEUR AND EXECUTIVE IN THE TECH SECTOR. A TRAINED COMPUTER SCIENTIST I FOUNDED IT SIX TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES AND SERVED AS AN EXECUTIVE AT LIFT AND READ IT. I HAVE BEEN ON THE INSIDE AND I KNOW FIRST HAND HOW TECH COMPANIES WORK AND HOW BUSINESS INCENTIVES DRIVE PRODUCT POLICY AND STRATEGY. IT'S NO SECRET. BIG SOCIAL MEDIA COME STRUGGLE TO MY CON WHEN THEY PLATFORMS. AND USERS ARE AS A- OKAY TO OUR TWENTY TWENTY ONE NASH RANKED. SURVEY OF INTERNET USER IN THE U. S. 41% OF RISK. HAVING SOME SORT OF A HARASSMENT AND 27% REPORTED EXPIRY. SOME ONLINE. INCLUDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT STALKING AND PHYSICAL THREATS. THAT'S MORE THAN ONE FOUR OF YOUR FRIENDS AND COWORKERS. AND% ONLY 14% OF THOSE WHO EXPERIENCED PHYSICAL THREAT AND THEN REPORTED IT SAID THE PLATFORM TO LEAD THE FRIGHTENING CONTENT. THE BUSINESS MODELS OF SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES ARE BUILT IN A WAY THAT AMPLIFIES HE- THESE PLATFORMS MAXIMIZE PROFITS BY PROVIDING HYPER TARGETED ADVERTISEMENTS TO AN AUDIENCE US. IT'S BEEN LARGE PARTS OF OUR LIVES ONLINE. CORE PRODUCT MECHANICS MAKE MY REALITY AND RECOMMENDATIONS ARE BUILT AROUND KEEPING YOU YOUR FRIENDS AND YOUR FAMILY ENGAGED TOGETHER EVEN MORE. AND SELL EVEN MORE ASK. THE PROBLEM IS THAT MISINFORMATION AND HATE FILLED AND POLARIZING CONTENT IS HIGHLY ENGAGING SO THOSE ALGORITHMS PROMOTE THAT CONTENT. AND IS THE DEALS ON RESEARCH HAS LONG SUGGESTED IN FACEBOOK WEEKS CONFIRM THESE PLATFORMS EXPLOIT PEOPLE'S PROCLIVITY TO INTERACT MORE WITH INCENDIARY CONTENT AND TECH COMPANIES DO SO WITH THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE HARMS THAT RESULT. ULTIMATELY THESE COMPANIES TO COLLECT OUR SAFETY AND SECURITY BECAUSE IT'S GOOD FOR THEIR BOTTOM LINE. LET ME TELL YOU THAT IT'S TOO DIFFICULT TO FIX IT OUTSIDE OF YOUR LEGAL JURISDICTION. NONSENSE WITH NO ACCOUNTABILITY NO REGULATION AND NO INCENTIVES BEYOND GROWTH AND INCREASING IN REVENUE THEY'RE CREATING A HAVEN FOR EXTREMISTS TO REACH RECRUIT AND RADICALIZE. FOUR MILLIGRAMS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE BEHAVIORS ESPECIALLY OUR TRACTION TO CONTROVERSIAL EXTREMISTNARRATIVES AND AS A RESULT SOME USERS GET TRAPPED IN A RABBIT HOLE OF TOXIC CONTENT PUSHING THEM TOWARDS EXTREMISM. MICHAEL GOOD SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES IN A POSITION WHERE THEY PLAN UNPRECEDENTED ROLE HOSTING AND PROMOTING HATE RACISM DISINFORMATION AND EXTREMISM. AND THE RESEARCH BEARS THAT OUT ACCORDING TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN STUDY FROM MIT FALSE NEWS STORIES ON TWITTER WERE 70% MORE LIKELY TO BE SHARED THAN TRUE ONES. ONCE FRINGE IDEOLOGIES THAT EXISTED WITHIN A MINORITY ARE NOW BEING IMPOLITE NORMALIZING RACIST HATEFUL EXTREMIST CONTENT AS IT SHOWS UP RIGHT NEXT TO POSTS FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY. MAIN STREAM PLATFORM SERVES AS A GATEWAY FOR EXTREMISTS TO RECRUIT CURIOUS AND DISAFFECTED INDIVIDUALS WITH GREAT IMPACT. WITH BILLIONS OF USERS BE UNDERSTATED. THE EXISTENCE AND VIRAL AMPLIFICATION OF HATE CONTENT IN DISINFORMATION IS A FEATURE NOT A BUG OF SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. YOU'RE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF THE HARMS THAT HAVE RESULTED FROM ALLOWING SOCIAL MEDIA TO GO UNCHECKED. JUST LAST MONTH WHISTLE BLOWER FRANCES HAUGEN MADE IT CLEAR THAT FACEBOOK WAS AWARE BOTH. OF BOTH OF THE ROLE ITS PLATFORM PLAYED IN THE JANUARY SIX INSURRECTION AND THE BROADER ROLL THE PLATINUM PLATES IN THE SPREAD OF DISINFORMATION EXTREMISM AND HATE. FACEBOOK DOCUMENTS STATED THAT THIS COMPANY HAD EVIDENCE THAT HE SPEECH DIVISIVE POLITICAL SPEECH AND MISINFORMATION ON FACEBOOK AND ITS OTHER PRODUCTS WORK FRACTURING SOCIETIES AROUND THE WORLD. THIS IS NOT A SURPRISE. SOME OF THE SITE AGREED HAVE BEEN RECORDING FOR YEARS ON THE IRRESPONSIBLE CHOICES THAT THESE PLATFORMS ARE TAKING BUT OUR SAFETY. LET ME BE CLEAR ACADEMIC EXCUSE ME ANTI SEMITIC. RACIST AND HATEFUL IMAGES REVERBERATING ON BIG SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS RESULT IN OFFLINE HEAT AND VIOLENCE DIRECTED OF MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES IN THE UNITED STATES CALLS TO VIOLENCE IN THE NAME OF WHITE SUPREMACY AND THE GREAT REPLACEMENT INSPIRED FATAL SHOOTINGS LIKE THOSE IN POWER WAY OF PASO IN PITTSBURGH AND LEAD TO INJURIES AND DEATH AT THE WHITE SUPREMACIST ATTACK IN CHARLOTTESVILLE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WE'VE SEEN HEALTHY APPLICATION RECOMMENDATIONS OF EXTREMIST GROUPS LIKE BOOGALOO. HAS LED DIRECTLY TO OFFLINE VIOLENCE INCLUDING RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IN MAY TWENTY TWENTY DAYS PATRICK UNDERWOOD OF FEDERAL PROTECTIVE SERVICES OFFICER FROM OAKLAND WAS KILLED IN A DRIVE BY SHOOTING ALLEGEDLY CARRIED OUT BY TWO PUBLIC HEARINGS. CONNECTED THROUGH FACEBOOK AND DISCUSSED THE IDEA TO COMMIT THE CRIME IN A FACEBOOK GROUP. THESE WERE NOT LOS OUR STUDENTS FROM THE SAME HIGH SCHOOL FACEBOOK HELPED REUNITE THE WAY MANY OF US HAVE REIGNITED OLD CONNECTIONS. THE ALLEGED ASSAILANTS HAD NEVER MET PRIOR TO BEING CONNECTED ONLINE. FACEBOOK PROPPANT TOGETHER BECAUSE OF THEIR SHARED ATTRACTION TO EXTREMIST CONTENT. FINALLY WHEN MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR TARGETED ONLINE WE CONSISTENTLY SEE OFFLINE IMPLICATIONS ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS ARE STILL BEING BLAMED FOR CREATING AND SPREADING THE CORONA VIRUS RESULTING IN AN UPTICK OF BOTH ONLINE HARASSMENT AND PHYSICAL ASSAULTS. VIDEOS ONLINE HEATING HARASSMENT SURVEY FOUND THAT ASIANAMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS EXPERIENCED THE LARGEST SINGLE RISE IN SEVERE ONLINE HARASSMENT YEAR OVER YEAR IN COMPARISON TO OTHER GROUPS. SIMILARLY ACCORDING TO STOP PHD IT BEEN OVER TWELVE HUNDRED PHYSICAL ASSAULTS AGAINST AAPI INDIVIDUALS NATIONWIDE SINCE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY. ALL MY HEART AND ALL PLAYING VIOLENCE ARE ONLY DENY BILLION HER TWICE ESPECIALLY FOR OUR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. SENATORS SELF REGULATION IS CLEARLY NOT WORKING HE'S BILLION AND TRILLION DOLLAR SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES HAVE THE RESOURCES TO IMPROVE SYSTEMS HI REGIONAL STAFF AND PROVIDE REAL TRANSPARENCY. GET THE CLAIMANTS TO BURDENSOME WITHOUT A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON INSIDE OF THESE COMPANIES WE CANNOT BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE REAL DANGER POSED TO THE PUBLIC WITHOUT CHANGES TO THEIR INCENTIVE SYSTEMS WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON GENERATING RECORD PROFITS AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR SAFETY AND THE SECURITY OF OUR REPUBLIC. SO MANY- ADVOCATES. FOR TRANSPARENCY HAD A WHOLE GOVERNMENT WHOLE OF SOCIETY APPROACH INCLUDING ESTABLISHED INITIATIVES LIKE STOPPING FOR PROFIT BACKSPACE HE AND THE REPAIR PLAN SO THAT WE CAN ALL LIVE SAFELY IN ONLINE AND OFFLINE SPACES. TRANSPARENCY WILL SERVE AT LEAST TWO IMPORTANT PURPOSES FIRST IT ACTS AS A DETERRENT. ENSURING THAT THESE PLATFORMS DON'T CREATE HIDDEN SYSTEMS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND THEN HIDE THEM FROM THE PUBLIC. AND SECOND IT ALLOWS POLICYMAKERS AND THE PUBLIC DEEPER INSIGHT INTO WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON SO WE CAN MAKE BETTER INFORMED POLICY. I CAME TO EDL FROM THE TECH INDUSTRY BECAUSE I BECAME INCREASINGLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE NORMALIZATION OF EXTREMIST AND BIGOTED NARRATIVES HAPPENING IN OUR SOCIETY AND BEING AMPLIFIED BY SOCIAL MEDIA ALGORITHMS. KEEPING US ENGAGED CLICKING SHARING AND COMMENTING IN OUR NEWS FEEDS IS AT THE HEART OF MOST OF THESE PLATFORMS BUSINESS MODELS HAVE SINCE MISINFORMATION AND INCENDIARY CONTENT GETS THAT ENGAGEMENT WE SEE THE AMPLIFICATION OF FRENCH IDEOLOGIES ALONGSIDE PICTURES OF OUR KIDS. ON MAINSTREAM SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. I'M THE SON OF A HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR. MY FAMILY KNOWS FIRST HAND HOW HATE BIGOTRY AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES HAVE HORRIFIC CONSEQUENCES WE KNOW THAT GENOCIDES DON'T COME OUT OF NOWHERE. AS IT'S BEEN FAMOUSLY SAID HISTORY DOESN'T REPEAT ITSELF BUT IT SURE DOES RHYME. WELL THE PLATFORM STATED INTENTION MAY BE DIFFERENT THE IMPACT IS REAL AND MEASURABLE AND THE STAKES COULDN'T BE HIGHER. WE CANNOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AGAIN WE NEED TRANSPARENCY FROM THESE PLATFORMS ON THEIR POLICIES ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES TO BRING AN END TO THE CYCLE OF EXTREMISM AND WE NEED YOUR HELP TO DO THIS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND WORKING ON A SOLUTION TO THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. THANK YOU MISTER SEPARATE ALL RIGHT NEXT US SOPHIE- JOHN. HELLO THANK YOU EVERYONE SAKE I DO HAVE A PRESENTATION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO TRY SHARE RIGHT HERE JUST TO CHECK IT'S A RENTS SEEN THIS. WE CAN WE CAN SEE IT THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK THIS IS ACTION I'VE ACTUALLY TESTIFIED I'M A FACEBOOK WHISTLEBLOWER I TESTIFIED A YEAR AGO TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND A FEW WEEKS AGO TO THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT BUT I WAS BORN IN CALIFORNIA I'VE LIVED IN THE BAY FOR THE BEST SIX SIX. YEARS SENSE I CAN SO THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO ME. AS A CITIZEN OF THE GOLDEN STATE. S. AND SO A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE GIVEN YOU GENERALITIES ABOUT THE HOMES BEING DAMAGED BY SOCIAL MEDIA I'M GOING TO GIVE A VERY SPECIFIC THANK. BASED ON MY OWN CLIMATE TO FACEBOOK THAT THEY HAD PERSONAL. EXPERIENCE AND SO I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR FIRST ABOUT WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT I WORKED ON AN AUTHENTIC ACTIVITY THE USE OF FAKE ACCOUNTS TO SPREAD MESSAGES. TO THE AVERAGE LAYPERSON THIS MAY SOUND SIMILAR TO MISINFORMATION IN FACT THEY ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. IF I SAY THAT CATS AND DOGS IT SEEMS SPECIES IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO STATES IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S A SCIENTIST- IT'S TEN YEAR OLD CHILD OR- DOG PRETTY TO BE A PERSON ON THE INTERNET IT'S STILL MISINFORMATION. AND HOPEFULLY PEOPLE CAN RECOGNIZE THAT. IN A SENTENCE IN A SENTENCE THAT IS. BY ON. SAY IF I SET UP TWO THOUSAND TAKE ACCOUNT. TO SAY THAT CUTS ARE DORA. THE IS FAKE REGARDLESS OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH ST STE. AND FACEBOOK WOULD BE CORRECT TO TAKE THE STOCKTON NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE AYE YA AFTERWARDS THAT FACEBOOK IS CENSORING UP ACUTE CATCH MESSAGE. AND SO PEOPLE A RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH A CONSTANT OUT THERE ARE GENUINE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE TO DRAW THE LINE I. MISS REGARDS TO MISINFORMATION AND HATE SPEECH. BUT TAKEN DOWN TAKE A CONCERT A RAM BY A GOVERNMENTS TO SPREAD THEIR MESSAGE IT'S NOT ABOUT A SNIPPET THAT SPEECH IT IS IMPACT NECESSARY TO PROTECT THAT FREEDOM. JUSTICE STOPPING BALLOT BOX STUFFING IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE RIGHT TO VOTE AND THE SANCTITY OF DEMOCRACY. I HOPE THIS IS CLEAR AND MAKE SENSE. AND SO AND SO AND SO ULTIMATELY THE DICTATORSHIPS OF TODAY ARE USING ARE USING THIS ACTIVITY TO REPRESS THE CITIZENRY IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE WARSAW PACT COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIPS. BUSTING CROWDS TO STICK DETECTIVES WE COULDN'T THEMSELVES AS HAVING FAR MORE SUPPORT THAN THE ACTUALLY THAT. GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON A VERY SPECIFIC. THAT THEY WORKED OUT. AND SO THIS IS IN AZERBAIJAN SMALL NATION. IN IN THE CAUCASUS BUT IT'S OFFICIALLY AT THE MOXIE AND SO DEMOCRATIC THEY MANAGED TO REDUCE ELECTION RESULTS THE DAY BEFORE THE ACTUAL ELECTION IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. IT'S DEMOCRATIC IN THE SAME WAY THAT NORTH KOREA IS THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC. AND SOAK IN THE AND SO. AND SO IN IN IN TWENTY NINETEEN I DISCOVERED AT. A DISCOVERED AN OPERATION BY THE AS EVERY GOVERNMENT IS TO USE FAKE ACCOUNTS TO HARASS THE AND EVERY OPPOSITION ON MASS. SINCE THAT TIME THE AND EVERY GOVERNMENT STEPPED UP. ITS STEP UP TO ARREST HIM PROTESTS. BY THE OPPOSITION ON MASS ARRESTING UP A STRIP PUT. POLITICIANS ON BASS AND EVENTUALLY WHICH IS FIGHTING THE WAR IT RESPECT BATES AYE MANIA. AYE UNDERSTANDS THAT ARE AT IT BUT IN ADDITION TO THE WAR OVER THE DISPUTED TERRITORY. NAGORNO KARABAKH AZERBAIJAN IS CURRENTLY ALSO OCCUPIED INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED. THE ARMENIAN TERRITORY. AND SO AND SO AND SO AND SO HERE ARE SOME KEY ABOUT HOW THIS ALL. TO END I HAVE YOUR SCREEN FROM DOING BEST. THIS IS THAT BY MY FOR OF THE CAN SCREENS UP. FOR THE POOR. AND THE IS ACTIVITY OVER TIME IN THE BUT- IN BACK- TIME AND SO THEY STE AND SO THE STARTED- AND THE STARTED IN A MY NAME. IN THE STRUCK YOU CAN SEE HOW THEY WITH THE WITH BASIC NO ACT. AT UNTIL THE DEATH KNELL STARTS TIME THE STOCK FOR LUNCH AND FROM P. ON THE PETER AT LEAST AT IN THE EVENING THAT PERHAPS. SIX SIX PM. TWIKI STATE WORKS. IN THE DENSE WITH NATIONAL SUCH AS YOUR AND NO THREATS WHICH IS FAR. IT DIFFER FROM HIGH NORMAL. PEOPLE BECAUSE- ACCORDING TO THE ACT INCREASED BECAUSE GROUPS. AND THE HER AND THE FOCUS ENTIRE ON HER. THAT READ MASTIC POSITION WITH. IF COLOR YOU MAKE THE RIGHT COMMENTS EACH MAX. AND EVEN HAS READ QUEST SINCE THAT. IT IF YOU WANT TO WRITE MONTHS ON THE SAME LINE IF NOT TOO HIGH FOR YOU RIGHT CONTAINS IT'S NOT TOO DIFFERENT. YOUR RIGHT HAND INSTALL. TRYING TO THEM UNIQUE. BUT AROUND- THAT'S THING THAT'S THAT'S THE- TRAFFIC. AS BECAUSE- AND SENSE OF THE- GO UPDATE WITH TO. CREATE AN OP SCORE GREAT TO SEE. EVEN ON SOCIAL. THAT GREW AT THE TOP. WHICH USED TO COME. FOR BE TRONG ABOUT BY THE VOICES OF GOVERNMENT TROLLS WHO WAS IT WHO ARE. NATIONAL MIGHT JUST WORKS THE OP. OF CONTRACT AND SAYING THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS NOT THE TO PAY. PROTECT AS A BY CHUNK FROM I MEAN. WHAT SOME RUBBISH LIKE THAT. AND SO I'VE GIVEN THE DETACHED. OF HERE. AND I DISCOVER THIS NOT FOR IN IN AUGUST OF TWENTY NINETEEN. FACEBOOK REFER. TO ACT KILL. AT UNTIL OCTOBER TWENTY CA BY THE TIME I GOING FOR. AND BY THE TIME THE NECK MCCORMACK. WACKSTAR BECAUSE OF FACEBOOK DELAY THIS WE EFFECTIVE THE ACCOUNTS. IN KIND BY FE. COULD IT ALSO. GOVERNMENT OF AS A BASE. BECAUSE THEY WITH THE THEY CAN THE RULES OF THE TOUCH. FACEBOOK'S BE. TO TAKE IT DOWN FOR MORE THAN A YEAR. FOR BY THE BY THE YOU TO THE FACTS THEY WAITED UNTIL THE WAR. IS DEDUCTED EVERY GOVERNMENT TO COURT IT THE AS EVERY. THAT'S TRUE OF THE F. F. THE NATIONAL. ARE I DO TOO. THE IMPACT OF THE DELIGHT I DO CAN IMPACT OF THE TAKE. AT AT AND FACE I UNDERSTAND THAT FACEBOOK HAS NOT. HAS NOT DISPUTED OF THESE. THE ARE THEY- WILL TELL YOU THAT AIM TO THAT THAT. I AM THEM OUT OF CONTACT. HELLO AND SO THIS IS STILL IN UNCLE TO DATE THE- PICKED UP FACEBOOK HAS NOTHING THIS FROM RECURRING AND THIS IS CRAZY. THAT I TOOK THAT THE THEY TOOK BEST NIGHT. AND SO YOU CAN SEE HERE THAT STATES POSTED BY RADIO FREE EUROPE AZERBAIJAN. WITH ARMS AT THE MIDWEST JUST A NEWS UPDATE ON THE SITUATION IN AZERBAIJAN. IT RECEIVED FIVE HUNDRED AND TEN COMMENTS SPOKE ALMOST ALL OF WHICH WERE IN AUTHENTIC. AND WE GENERALLY. JINGOISTIC PRO PRO AT THAT RECOMMITMENT COULD. AND IF YOU LOOK TO THE RIGHT YOU CAN SEE THAT ALL OF THESE. BY FROM IN THE THAT LOOKS LIKE TO KEEP BUT THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY. DOUBT PRETENDING TO BE YOUR- PATRIOTS IT'S A FACEBOOK. FOR INSTANCE THE FOR. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THE NAME HAVE THE PERSON FACEBOOK BUT PROBABLY. ALSO KIND OF. PAGE IN FOR THEY PUT. INTENDED FOR THE THAT AT TICO AND PER. THE AT FACEBOOK THERE WAS NOTHING. IT AND SOMEONE FOR FIFTY SEVEN FACED PER TO BE WHO DOES EXIST GIVEN ITS NAMES. PICTURE THAT COULD BE A PERSON I CALL THIS OF THE X. EXCEPT BY NOW IT'S MORE THE THAT ONCE ALL. EXPORT. AND SURFACED AND SO. AND SO IT. AND SO. THE YEAR THAT YOU THERE GOD. OFFICE TOOK. IT'S NOT TO DO KEEP IT FROM COMING BACK. IT WAS ESSENTIALLY BACK. S. AND SO THAT WAS THE CITY IN NATION AS A BECAUSE OF COURSE ALSO THE UNITED STATES AMERICANS ARE ALSO DEEPLY DISTRESSED OF ABILITY TO STOP THIS FOR COMMITTEE INTERFERE. AND SO I'VE HIGHLIGHTED MAKES THEM FROM FEBRUARY OF YEAR IMAGE INMATES AND NORTH CAROLINA FACED PAGE WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S AT THE TO KEEP FOREIGN INTERFERE PRESENT RUSSIAN INTERFERE BECAUSE THE THIS PAGE WITH SPREAD WITH SPREADING MISINFORMATION AND UNTIL SOMETIME RESP TO PEOPLE MS INDIA IN THE TROUT RESTAURANTS REDICK. AND I WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO MUST THIS THIS WAS NOT A CASE OF RUSSIAN. THIS WAS THE CASE OF AN NORTH CAROLINA IN GROUP OF THE IT WILL BE A FUNNY TO PROTECT TO BE BACK DISCUSS RUSSIAN. TO MAKE PEOPLE OF IT WOULD BE FUN IF IT WEREN'T SO SAD. BUT BUT BECAUSE OF BECAUSE IT. TEN THIS THIS CAUSED A- TO. NOT TURN URGENT INVESTIGATION. IN CONTRAST. WITH BATCH. TO ACT SIMULTANEOUSLY CASE. OF THE CORRECTION BUT SUCH A FOR THE- HE GUYS PUT. I WANT TO BE BUT RECOUP. AT AT THE CASH. THAT THAT'S THAT THIS CASE WITH AND WE- TO THE REST GOVERNMENT. TO KNOW SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. BUT IT'S STILL VERY TELLING THAT FACEBOOK'S CHOSE TO FOCUS ON THE FIKRET. ACTIVITY OPPOSED TO THE ACTUAL RESCUE. COMMITTEE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE THOUGHT OF MAKES PRIORITIES IT'S PRECISELY BY. ARE SO CONCERNED THE FOR PLACE. AND SO AND SO AND THIS GETS TO THE HEART OF THE AUTOMATIC PROP THEM TO LAUNCH THE BUT SPLIT DESPITE FACEBOOK'S ADDRESSING IT. THE FIRST ONE AS OTHERS HAVE THIS IN MY EXTERNAL. THE DAMAGE TO CREATE BY SUCH A FIVE. WE DON'T EXPECT AND POOREST ITSELF TOBACCO ADDICTION WE DON'T EXPECT EQUIFAX TO STOP KIDS. IF PERSONAL INFORMATION BREACH. AND IN OTHER AREAS. FOR EXTERNAL PROBLEM THE FOR THE IS BY DOWN COULD. AND WORKERS MAKE A DECISIONS GOVERNMENTS CAN STEP IN. BUT THE PROBLEM IS HE DOESN'T TAKE ACTIVITY IT'S A QUICK PROCESS CANNOT BE SEEN AND FAKE ACCOUNTS AND MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN THEY'LL BE STUCK WITH THE BILL. FACEBOOK NATURALLY FOCUSES ON WHAT GETS ATTENTION. IT FAKE ACTIVE BUT GETS ATTENTION IT'S THE MOST COMPETENT IF YOU'RE A SPY AND EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO YOU ARE YOU ARE NOT A VERY GOOD SPY AND THAT'S WHAT JAMES BOND FOR SOME REASON. AND SO THAT AND SO THAT IS PRECISELY WHY IN THE IN IN THE BEST LIGHT FACEBOOK CHOSE TO FOCUS ON A CASE A FAKE. FAKE RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE AND IGNORED ACTUAL PLAN BECAUSE IT FOCUSED ON WHAT GOT CAUGHT ATTENTION. IN ORDER TO SOLVE A PROBLEM YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND IT AND RECOGNIZE IT BUT RIGHT NOW THE ONLY GROUP THAT UNDERSTANDS THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM ON SOCIAL MEDIA. OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES THEMSELVES AND THIS MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE CONSUMERS TO MAKE EDUCATED DECISIONS OR EVEN GOVERNMENTS TO STEP IN AND REGULATE. BUT I THINK IT'S MY PRESENTATION THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH I TRY TO KEEP IT SHORT DUE TO THE TIME CONSTRAINTS. THANK YOU I'M A STRONG VERY VERY INTERESTING- ALL RIGHT NEXT- DR- WHEN NEEDING SYLVIA- JOE. YES THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIRMAN LOMBERG VICE CHAIRMAN GORGEOUS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE OF HEALTH MISINFORMATION FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE BUT WE HAVE A BRIEF. INTRODUCTION I WORK AT THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE WHICH IS PART OF IT AND I H. IN THE HEALTH COMMUNICATION INFORMATICS RESEARCH BRANCH WHEN I COULD IMAGINE THAT ECONOMIC BACKGROUND INCLUDES A PHD IN SOCIOLOGY WITH STEAKS AND A MASTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH FROM THE BEAUTIFUL UC BERKELEY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IN ADDITION TO OVERSEEING A PORTFOLIO OF FUNDED RESEARCH I ALSO LET LEAD A ROBUST RESEARCH PROGRAM ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND HEALTH COMMUNICATION AND A OVER THE LAST FIVE FOUR YEARS WE HAVE FOCUSED ON UNDERSTANDING THE SPREAD OF HEALTH MISINFORMATION RECENTLY I SERVED AS A GUEST EDITOR FOR A SPECIAL TEAM ISSUE ON THIS TOPIC FOR THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH- OUR BRANCH AT NCI SUPPORTS RESEARCH THAT AIMS TO REALLY OPTIMIZE COMMUNICATION TO FACILITATE. THE AMERICAN PUBLIC STE IF DECISION MAKING ABOUT THEIR HEALTH WHETHER IT'S CANCER SCREENING TOBACCO CESSATION OR VACCINATION IN RECENT YEARS THOUGH OUR WORK HAS BEEN COMPLICATED BY A COMPLEX AND EVOLVING SOCIAL CULTURAL POLITICAL LANDSCAPE AND THE GROWTH OF SOCIAL MEDIA AS WE ALL KNOW FROM THIS PANDEMIC AND OUT IT'S BEEN DEMONSTRATED PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES ARE INADEQUATE IN THE FACE OF POLITICIZATION POLARIZATION AND MISINFORMATION. AND WE'RE SEEING EVIDENCE OF DISINFORMATION ACTORS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A HEALTH CRISIS AND THE PUBLIC'S HEIGHTENED EMOTIONS TO FURTHER THEIR AGENDA IN FACT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF RESEARCH ON NEGATIVE EMOTIONS SUCH AS FEAR AND ANGER BEING EXPLOITED TO SPREAD MISINFORMATION. ESPECIALLY ABOUT VACCINES. SO THESE ARE. SUGGEST TO OUR ALLY THAT THE SPREAD OF HEALTHCARE. WILL CONTINUE BEYOND THIS PANDEMIC AND IS SOMETHING THAT PUBLIC HEALTH HAS TO WRESTLE WITH IN A LONG TERM. SO MY BRIEF REMARKS WILL ADDRESS THREE BROADER POINTS WHITE HOUSE MISINFORMATION IS A CRITICAL BUT COMPLEX PROBLEM WHAT DO WE KNOW. FROM OUR RESEARCH- AND SOME KEY QUESTIONS WE NEED TO ANSWER IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY RESPOND. WE KNOW THAT TODAY SOCIAL MEDIA HAS BECOME A PRIMARY SOURCE OF NEWS AND INFORMATION AND USERS ARE SHARING THEIR HEALTH INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA. WE REALLY THOUGHT OF THIS AS A VERY EXCITING OPPORTUNITY FOR HEALTHY FOR MANY WAYS CONNECTING PATIENTS WITH SIMILAR HEALTH. CHALLENGES AND OFFERING SUPPORT ONSTAGE INFORMATION TO GATHER A HEALTHY DIET HOWEVER THE SHARING A FULL SPENT ON PROVEN INFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA HAS MANY CONCERNING CONSEQUENCES FOR HEALTH. IT COULD LEAD PEOPLE TO MAKE HOW HARMFUL HEALTH DECISIONS LOSE TRUST IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM OR SPEND MONEY ON USELESS OR EVEN HARMFUL TREATMENTS. HOWEVER SOME OF THESE CONCERNS OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND WE REALLY DO NEED MORE EVIDENCE ON. THE EXTENT TO WHICH. MANY. I DON'T THINK DR JOE HANG ON FOR SECOND THERE'S SOME INTERFERENCE OKAY. BUT IT MAY BE IT MAY BE SOMETHING HITTING THE MICROPHONE YOUR MICROPHONE. NOW I UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I'M PUTTING MY- I PUT MY PRINT IS A SPEECH ON MY KEYBOARD AND- OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK. THANK YOU FOR IT FOR LETTING ME KNOW BECAUSE I COULDN'T TELL FROM MY END SO I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO INTERFERE WITH YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU- I THINK ANOTHER BIG ISSUE IS THAT THERE IS A LOT OF RESEARCH SHOWING THAT DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS CREATE AN IMPRESSION THAT THERE'S NO CONSENSUS EXISTING ON TOPICS SUCH AS VACCINES OR CLIMATE CHANGE WHEN IN FACT THIS SCIENCE IS LARGELY SETTLED. SO- IF YOU SEE THAT THERE'S REALLY A SENSE OF APATHY OR CONFUSION OR DISTRUST I COULD BE VERY MUCH TO IT RESULT OF BEING. EXPOSED TO MISINFORMATION SO PEOPLE COULD END UP AVOIDING HEALTHCARE OR MAKING DECISIONS THAT ARE DETRIMENTAL TO THEIR HOUSE. ANOTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IS THE IMPORTANT AND THIS WAS ALREADY HIGHLIGHTED BY DAVID. MISTER SEA FREEZE COMMENT ABOUT THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN REAL WORLD AND ONLINE WORLD. SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTIONS HARMFUL EFFECTS ARE ESPECIALLY GREAT WHEN REAL WORLD INFLUENCE TRANSLATES INTO ONLINE POWER FOR EXAMPLE WE SAW THIS- THIS LAST YEAR ATTEMPTS AT USING. COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS TO EMBOLDEN RACISM AND XENOPHOBIA ON TWITTER HAS CONTRIBUTED TO MANY EXPERIENCING ANTI ASIAN HATE AND VIOLENCE AND I AGE WE HAVE A LOT OF RESEARCH DEMONSTRATING THAT SUCH EXPERIENCES HAVE DOCUMENTED NEGATIVE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES. FINALLY THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION IS A COMPLEX PROBLEM THE MORE WE GET INTO IT THE MORE WE SEE THAT SO MUCH IS NUANCED A LOT OF CONTENT IS NOT PROVABLY FALSE BUT SIMPLY MISLEADING. A BASED ON INSINUATION OR CHOICE OF VISUALS OR AT PERSONAL ANECDOTES THAT ARE HARD TO REFUTE. SO WHAT DO WE KNOW VERY BRIEFLY I'M GOING TO SUMMARIZE A FEW KEY TAKE AWAYS FROM RESEARCH. THERE IS A LOT OF RESEARCH ASSESSING THE ACCURACY OF HEALTH. INFORMATION ON VARIOUS HEALTH TOPICS TWO EXAMPLES A RECENT PAPER LOOKED AT COMMON CANCERS- BEING COVERED ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND FOUND OVER 30% CONTAINED MISINFORMATION AND EVEN HARM BILL INFORMATION. AND ARE CONTAIN MR. GARNER MORE ENGAGE THAN THOSE WITH ACCURATE INFORMATION. ANOTHER YOUTUBE BASED ANALYSIS FOUND THAT PROSTATE CANCER INFORMATION- THE VIDEOS ON PROSTATE CANCER AT INFORMATION AT UP 277% THAT CONTENT BOX CONTAINED BIASED OR FALSE CONTENT- OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T NEED TO- I DON'T NEED TO ELABORATE ON KOPET NINETEEN RELATED MISINFORMATION BECAUSE IT RUNS. FROM ORIGINS OF VIRUS TO PROMOTING OF- PROMOTION ABOUT IMPROVEMENT TREATMENTS. SO I THINK THE IMPORTANT PART IS TO MOVE BEYOND ANALYZING CONTENT TO I INVITE. TO IDENTIFY MAJOR SOURCES OF MISINFORMATION AND ONES THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO COST HEART. THANK SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS THE BEST PERSONALITY THE CREATION AND MAINTENANCE OF INFORMATION SILOS AND ECHO CHAMBERS- WHETHER IT'S BY RECOMMENDING SIMILAR CONTENT TO WHAT USERS HAVE ALREADY SEEN OR MAKING IT EASY FOR USERS TO SELF CURATE THEIR FEET. THESE FEATURES ARE DESIGNED TO MAXIMIZE ENGAGEMENT AS WE KNOW BUT THEY DO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT INDIVIDUALS WILL BE EXPOSED TO CONTENT THAT CONTRADICT THEIR EXISTING VIEWS WHICH THEN IN THE LONG RUN MAKE. EXPOSURE TO MISINFORMATION THAT MUCH HARDER TO COME BACK. SALI SOME RESEARCH SHOWING THERE ARE SOME WAYS WE CAN ADDRESS IT. UP WE'VE SEEN LITERATURE ON BANKING OR CORRECTING FALSE MISINFORMATION. IN THE REALM OF HEALTH CAN BE EFFECTIVE HOWEVER OUR RESEARCH AND OTHERS HAVE SHOWN THAT CORRECTIONS ARE NOT AS EFFECTIVE WHEN THE ISSUE HAS BECOME POLARIZED AND VIEWS. OF THE TOPIC HAS BECOME ENTRENCHED. ANOTHER SOLUTION IS MORE OF A LONG TERM ONE AIMING AT BROADENING HEALTH LITERACY EFFORTS TO INCREASE HEALTH SCIENCE AND MEDIA LITERACY FOR EXAMPLE RAISING AWARENESS THAT THERE ARE COMMON TECHNIQUES COMMONLY USED BY AGENTS OF MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION. USING PUBLIC'S UNDERSTANDING THAT SCIENCE IS INHERENTLY COMPLEX AND EVOLVING- OR CONSIDERING INDUCING A HEALTHY SCRATCH SKEPTICISM TOWARDS CLAIMS THAT ARE OVERLY SIMPLISTIC IT COULD ALSO HELP TO DECREASE PEOPLE'S VULNERABILITY. FINALLY WHAT ARE SOME RESEARCH NEEDED NOW WE NEED RESEARCH TO INFORM MEASURES OBVIOUSLY AND I THINK A FEW I'M JUST GONNA COME AND- BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE A FEW HIGHLIGHTS HI. YES I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT NUMBER ONE MORE WORK NEEDS TO UNCOVER THE MOTIVATIONS AND TECHNIQUES BEHIND MISINFORMATION EFFORTS AND REFLECT THESE KNOWLEDGE IN ALGORITHMICS DESIGNS AND PRACTICAL CHANGES IF WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE ROOT CAUSES OF MISINFORMATION WE WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY A GAME OF WHACK A MOLE WHERE EVERY WITH EVERY PIECE OF NEW MISINFORMATION THAT EMERGES. SO IN OTHER WORDS AND WE'VE PROBABLY HEARD THE SHOTS THROUGHOUT THE TESTING- TESTIFIED MONIES THAT WE NEED A SYSTEMIC STRUCTURAL APPROACHES INSTEAD OF PATCHWORK BANDAID SOLUTIONS I'M PART OF THIS APPROACH INCLUDES WORK TO BETTER UNDERSTAND MOVEMENT. OF MISINFORMATION ACROSS PLATFORMS AND ACROSS DIFFERENT. LANGUAGES AND SORT OF THINKING ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA AS AN ECO SYSTEM THAT'S BOTH DECENTRALIZED. BUT INTERCONNECTED. MOREOVER WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF CONTENT MODERATION EFFORTS DONE BY PLATFORMS. TO THE STATE THERE IS SO LITTLE KNOWN ABOUT OUTSIDE THE COMPANIES SO MORE ACCESS TO DATA AND TRANSPARENCY WOULD ENABLE RESEARCHERS TO EVALUATE THE DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRACTICES. IN FACT ACTUALLY MITIGATION MEASURES COULD LEAD TO SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS CREATING AN INFORMATION VACUUM AND WE SEEN THIS WITHOUT ONE STUDY LOOKING AT HPV VACCINE INFORMATION ON PINTEREST. AFTER CONTENT MODERATION POLICIES WERE IN PLACE BOTH- CREDIBLE AND NON CREDIBLE INFORMATION WERE REDUCED. THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF HPV VACCINATION CONTENT WAS WAS BASICALLY ARE GREATLY REDUCED SO I THINK THIS IS ALSO A REMINDER WE CAN JUST REMOVE BAD COUNT CONTENT BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE ARE PROVIDING. EVIDENCE BASED INFORMATION ON THE SIDE- THE LAST POINT IS I THINK WE NEED TO AND I AND I AGE WE FOCUS SO MUCH OF OUR WORK ON ADDRESSING HEALTH DISPARITIES AND PROMOTING HEALTH EQUITY. SO WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF EXPOSURE TO MISINFORMATION ESPECIALLY ON THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES- WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN MISINFORMATION AND HEALTH DISPARITIES IT COULD BE THAT BY ENDORSING MISINFORMATION AND BEHAVING IN SUCH A WAY. IN ONE COMMUNITY FOR EXAMPLE WOULD ENSURE TO MIDDLE CLASS INDIVIDUALS REFUSING VACCINATIONS FOR CORBETT AND NOT WEARING MASKS INDOORS COULD STILL DISPROPORTIONATELY HURT THE POOR OR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. SO YOU THINK ABOUT A VACCINATED CUSTOMER MARKET CLERK WITH CHRONIC DISEASE WORKING IN THAT AREA WITH LOW VACCINE UPTAKE FOR EXAMPLES. SO MY FINAL THOUGHT TO END IS THAT MISINFORMATION IS A COMPLEX CHALLENGE AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE GREAT HARM TO THE PUBLIC'S HEALTH- I'M CITING THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL'S ADVISORY. WE DO NEED A WHOLE OF SOCIETY APPROACH TO SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESSED HIS PROBLEM. THANK YOU I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. AND I. FOR MY SHUFFLING OF PAPER ON OVERLY WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU DR- QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THE CENTER STONE YES. BERMAN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MAYBE FOR- THE PREVIOUS PANELIST- DOCTORED SHOW AND THEN PERHAPS FOR MISTER SEA FREE AS WELL. EIGHT EIGHT SIMILAR QUESTION THAT I ASKED OF THE PREVIOUS PANELS IN TERMS OF QUANTIFYING- OR IN SOME WAY PROVIDING SOME ESTIMATE OF THE OVERALL SOCIAL COST- DOCTOR CHOU IN THE IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH CONTEXT. ARE THERE ANY EFFORTS TO ACTUALLY SCOPE OUT WHAT THE IMPACT OF THIS MISINFORMATION- HAS BEEN ON OUR PANDEMIC AND WHAT THE ADDITIONAL COSTS ESSENTIALLY OF HAVING THESE PLATFORMS AS- AS NETWORKS FOR SUCH MISINFORMATION IN OTHER WORDS THE- WITHOUT. THAT SPEED OF TRAVEL OF INFORMATION FLOW WOULD WE HAVE LOST. FEWER PEOPLE TO COVERT AND HOW MANY FEWER PEOPLE MIGHT WE HAVE LOST AND HOW HOW MUCH MORE LIFE MIGHT WE'VE SAVED HAVE YOU HAVE YOU LOOKED INTO. THAT SORT OF SCOPE OF INQUIRY. THANK YOU- FOR YOUR QUESTION- I CAN'T GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC NUMBERS UNFORTUNATELY BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THIS IS A BIG BIG AREA EMERGING AREA OF RESEARCH I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF DATA AND WHAT THE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE IS TO CONNECT THE DOTS SO WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE OF MISINFORMATION EXPOSURE WE CAN. QUANTIFY YOU KNOW ON THIS PLATFORM ON THIS TOPIC THERE IS A LOT OF MISINFORMATION THIS AMOUNT. NOW WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THAT EXPOSURE TRANSLATES TO INDIVIDUALS BEHAVIORS- THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME NATIONAL DATA THE PEW DATA- TIZER FAMILY FOUNDATION AND ANY OTHERS THAT HAVE BEEN SAY LOOKING AT IN THE SPECIFIC CONTEXT OF THIS PANDEMIC. LOOKING AT AXING HESITANCY AND MEASURING KIND OF ENDORSEMENT OF SIR TEN MINUTES AND YOU KNOW CLAIMS THAT ARE NOT A FALSE CLAIMS ARE LINKED TO A HESITANCY OR REFUSAL OF VACCINATION- SO I DO THINK THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS WE CONNECT THE DOTS WHERE WE SEE THAT MISINFORMATION DUST. TRANSLATE INTO HOLES AND DOG IMPACTS AND LIVES LOST AND LYFT SAVED- BUT I DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC NUMBERS I DO THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR US FOR US AT NIH AS WELL AS YOU KNOW MANY MANY OTHER YOU IN THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY NEEDED CURRENTLY ISN'T BEING DISCLOSED TO PROVIDE THAT. THAT SORT OF RESEARCH BASED THAT. THE DOT CONNECTING EXERCISE HE SPOKE OF. I THINK NUMBER ONE- WE LOOK AT HOW DO WE DO INVITE SCANS SO WE CAN SAY ON FACEBOOK WE COUNT YOU KNOW A LOT OF COUNTING AND EVALUATION. WE DON'T REALLY HAVE DATA ON WHO IS ACTUALLY SEEING IT AND HOUSING AND AFFECTS THE BEHAVIOR SO I THINK WE NEED TO. OBSTACLE MORE SURVEYS THAT'S LOOKING AT EXPOSURE AND LINKING IT TO OUTCOMES WE ALSO NEED- YOU KNOW DATA FROM OTHER SOURCES SUCH AS YOU KNOW PLATFORM DATA WHICH I'M A SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCHERS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO- YOU KNOW TO UNDERSTAND THE MOVEMENTS ON THESE DIFFERENT PLATFORMS SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY LINK. EXPOSURE TO OUTCOMES. UNDERSTOOD LAST QUESTION AS- FOR THERE ARE FIRST HAND PANEL SITTING MISCHIEF REEF WITH THE DEAL YOU'D MENTIONED IT A FEW OF THE- PROACTIVE INITIATIVES OUT THERE TO- TRY TO MITIGATE SOME OF THESE EFFECTS. DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHETHER THE- TECH INDUSTRY WRIT LARGE- SOCIAL MEDIA. THE COMPANY'S READ LARGER EVEN INDIVIDUALLY ARE ASSISTING- WITH ANY OF THESE EIGHTY L. OR OTHER EFFORTS OUT THERE TO. COMBAT HATRED OR SORT OF DEAL WITH SOME OF THESE. SOCIAL EXTERNALITIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR I YES OF. LISTEN MY DAY JOB I SIT AND I TALK TO SENIOR EXECUTIVES AT ALL OF THE MAJOR LARGE PLATFORMS RIGHT THEY THEY THEY ARE CONCERNED- THE PROBLEM HERE IS INCENTIVE SYSTEMS. AND ALSO THE YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT THESE BUSINESS MODELS ARE TUNED IN SUCH A WAY THAT CONTENT MODERATION IN REDUCING THE HEAT RIGHT WHAT I DON'T BELIEVE ANYBODY AT ANY OF THESE MAJOR PLATFORMS GOES INTO WORK SAYING GEE HOW CAN I CREATE MORE HEAT OR SEE MORE GENOCIDES. OCCUR BUT WHAT REALLY IS GOING ON HERE IS THAT THE INTERNAL INCENTIVE SYSTEMS ARE DIS INCENTIVIZING INCLUDING THE RIGHT RESOURCES ON TO SOLVING THE PROBLEM AND IN FACT. ARE CREATING INCENTIVES THAT EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM MORE DEEPLY AND SO THE REAL CHALLENGE HERE IS YOU KNOW HOW DO WE CHANGE THE INCENTIVE SYSTEM SO THAT. THESE INCREDIBLE COMPANIES WILL ACTUALLY BE ABLE. IN THE RATIONAL MANNER TO. BE ABLE TO FIGHT THIS KIND F HATE TO YOU KNOW REDUCE AND REMOVE THESE PEOPLE FROM THEIR PLATFORMS BUT RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO DISINCENTIVE IN IN FACT. YOU KNOW THE VETERANS THIS IS WHY TRANSPARENCY IS SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND WHY TRANSPARENCY AT THE LEVEL OF AGGREGATE STATISTICS RIGHT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT FINDING OUT WHAT WHAT'S GOING ON ONE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL INVESTIGATION HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. WHAT ACTUALLY ARE YOUR POLICIES. YOU KNOW WHO THEM OUT CLEARLY AND THEY HOW DO YOU ACT IN. THAT POLICY WHAT WERE THE DIFFERENT BEHAVIORS AND ACTIONS THAT YOU TOOK AND HOW EFFECTIVE WERE THE EIGHT. AND YOU KNOW THIS WOULD ACTUALLY NUMBER ONE. COULD PUT THE COMPANIES IN A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN'T HAVE SECRET POLICIES THEY CAN'T HAVE JUST SORT OF EXCEPTIONS THAT THEY CHOOSE TO ME FOR A PARTICULAR CELEBRITY OR POLITICIAN OR RELIGIOUS LEADER. YOU KNOW WHAT WE FOUND INTERESTING LEVY TOOK A WHISTLE BLOWER IN THE- RIGHT TO FIND OUT THAT FACEBOOK HAD. A SORT OF SHADOW POLICY SYSTEM CALLED CROSS CHECK. WHERE YOU KNOW IT WAS INTENDED ORIGINALLY TO HELP. THAT THAT THERE WOULDN'T OVER ENFORCEMENT OF CERTAIN KINDS OF BEHAVIORS- WHERE THEY SAID OKAY WELL YOU KNOW FOR CELEBRITIES ARE CERTAIN POLITICAL INFLUENCERS LIKE. THAT THEY WOULD- THAT THEY WOULD- IT GET MANUAL REVIEW HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE. ENDED UP IN THAT SYSTEM ACCORDING TO THESE DOCUMENTS AND SO THAT'S JUST COMPLETELY UNTENABLE IT ESSENTIALLY MEANT THAT THESE CELEBRITIES AND POLITICIANS WHO BY THE WAY DRIVING GAUGE MEANT. RIGHT THESE RELIGIOUS FIGURES THAT YOU HELP EVEN PEOPLE'S PETS WHO ARE POPULAR THAT THE WORD IN MANY CASES ALLOWED TO COMPLETELY FREE RIDE. AND THAT THERE IS NO NEED TO BE ABLE TO ENFORCE WHERE THERE WAS NO ONE FORCED ME. OF THEIR POLICIES THAT THEY HAVE SO STEP ONE IS WE NEED TO GET SOME REALLY CLEAR TRANSPARENCY ON WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON. AND THEN NUMBER TWO WE CAN LOOK AT WHAT ARE THOSE BEHAVIORS WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF. CHANGES THAT THEY'RE MAKING TO THEIR INCENTIVE SYSTEMS AND TO THE PRODUCTS THAT ACTUALLY HELP TO MITIGATE THIS HATE SO I DO THIS. AND MAKING SURE THAT THE COMPANIES THEMSELVES ALL OF THEM HAVE TO MEET THIS MINIMUM BAR THEY'LL ACTUALLY BE INCENTIVIZED TO COMPETE ON HOW WELL THEY'RE PROTECTING US ON HOW WELL THEY ARE ACTUALLY IMPROVING THEIR SYSTEMS. AND THAT NO ONE WANTS TO BE THE ONE WHO IS DOING A WORSE JOB BUT TODAY THERE'S NO INCENTIVE BECAUSE- IF I GO I'VE BEEN TOLD YOU KNOW IF ONE COMPANY GOES OUT AND SAYS ONE THING THERE'S NO INCENTIVE OR OR NEED FOR ANOTHER COMPANY TO DO THE SAME. SO THEY ALL LOOK BAD I DON'T WANT TO JUST PRESENT A FACE. AND THAT IS A PROBLEM SO I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY AT THE CORE IF WE NEED. TO UNDERSTAND BETTER WHAT'S GOING ON. THANK YOU- THANK YOU MISTER SIR. AND THANKS TO ALL OF ALL OF YOU FOR PULLING OUT CHANNEL. THAT EXIST- THE MISINFORMATION EXPLOITATION HARASSMENT I I'VE GOT A QUESTION. FOR MR JONG- CENTER STERN AND I ARE BOTH FORMER CHAIRS ELECTIONS COMMITTEE AND IN THE- EVENT THAT YOU POINT OUT OF. REGARDING AZERBAIJAN ARE REALLY FRIGHTENING- IN ANY COMMENT ON. WHAT WE CAN DO HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OR OR WHAT THE- ATTENTION HERE'S AND I STATES TO HAVE A SIMILAR INSTANCES OCCUR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTIONS AND FUNDAMENTALLY FUNDAMENTALLY THE WAY I WOULD DESCRIBE IT IT'S THAT IT'S THAT'S THE SITUATION IN AZERBAIJAN AND ON THE REST OF THE NATION'S A CARBON DICTATE CHRIS ESSENTIALLY HAVE THE NATION AT THE PLAYGROUND THE USE REPRESSIVE TOOLS TO HARASS AND EXPLOIT THE ONSET THE CITIZENRY AND OF COURSE THE CONFINED SPACE TO BRING THAT. INTO THE DIFFICULT ROAD. AND SPEND BUT AND SO THEY SITUATION AND SO THERE IS THIRTY. THE SITUATION UNITED STATES ITS SEARCH NOT THAT WE ARE NOT A RISK SEEN OUR ON THE GO. RUN TAKE SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS THANK. A CALL. UP TO THIS ANYMORE THAN BE AT RISK OF MASS ARRESTS OF ALL PUT THIS LEADERS AS OCCURRED AS A- OR IF AS A BETA IS EFFECTIVE A BAND KEEP IT. AND BUT IT BUT AND SPENT THIS POINTS TO AS AT SIX I THINK OF THE ROLE FACTORS. THE CULTURE. IN THE SENSE THAT IN THE SENSE THAT. IT AMERICA'S DEMOCRACY WITH THE IN SEE RUSSIA IS A FASCINATING BUT THESE ARE NOT DEMOCRACIES IN THE SAME BAY AND SO BOTH LINES CAN DOES MAYBE COMMON SOME DEMOCRACIES. IN OTHERS THAT CLEARLY STATES IT WOULD BE A MASSIVE SCALE AND- AND UNSINKABLE IF IT IF IT OCCURRED. AND SO ULTIMATELY. WHEN IT'S NOT. OF LIKE THE MEETING IT IN IT THAT'S THE VICE OTHER BY. OTHERWISE THEY'D GET BRAKE THEY OPEN CASE AT AND FOR AND FOR THE MARI MOTORISTS WILL BE BOENNING KIDDING POSE A POLITICAL. ON THOSE WHO COMMIT IT CRIMES IN THE IN THE. ALL MY AND SO THAT'S WHY IT'S THE IT SO. TO IN THE UNITED STATES. TO TREAT CASE OF THAT SORT OF A HARSH THE LIKE FOR INSTANCE IN THE IN THE IN U. S. CUT EIGHT IT LOOKS I WILL ONE I WAS ONE OF. THE FEW ONE OF MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY WHO'VE ON WEST TO GET. APART AS HE PUT THAT GROUP THAT WAS THAT WAS RUNNING ADVERTISE. IF US SO PARTY KIT SPADE. IT TO SPLIT THE VOTE AND THIS AND THIS ITEM GROUP CLAIMS TO BE AT LEAST ADVERTISING TO BE ON THE AS OF A SEARCH PARTY. BUT FACEBOOK AND THE INVESTIGATOR NEW PROOF VALID IT WAS AT. IT BATES BATES BATES MAKE A MAJOR PUSH PARTY WITH SUPPORTERS OF MAJOR POLITICAL WO HOPING JUST COULD IT WILL HELP YOU THE QUOTE AND- FOR TO ACT BEFORE EXAMPLE OF A KEY THAT WOULD. TO AS VERY CONCERNING WHAT FOR MYSELF AS TO HOW YOU CAN AVOID DOWN THE ROAD THAT SNAKES SUCH AS- AS IT RAGED. BECAUSE WHEN THE RULE OF DAHLE NOT A- FORCED. IN KENYA FOR THE INFO TO AND JUSTICE FOR EVERYONE ELSE THAT IS NOT TO SIT. IT IS A HIGH. THAT DECATUR SUCH THE PEOPLE REPUBLIC OF CHINA. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU TO ALL THREE ALL THE OF YOU FOR. THAT AND FOR- THIS IS A CONTINUING PROCESS AS YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT. UP IS A LEGISLATION THAT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CONCERNS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU. OUR NEXT PANEL WHAT IS BEING DONE TO ADDRESS. THE ISSUES THAT HAVE JUST BEEN- ELUCIDATED DURING THE COURSE OF THE HEARING AND WHAT CAN BE DONE IN CALIFORNIA- SO- WE HAVE. STATE ILLUSTRIOUS PANEL HERE OF FIRST WE HAVE OF MISTER DYLAN HOFFMAN- MISTER HOFFMAN ARE YOU AVAILABLE. FROM THE- INTERNET ASSOCIATION. YES I AM ME MR YES. IT WAS A GREAT PLEASURES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS STILL IN HOSPITAL DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR- INTERNET ASSOCIATION- WE REPRESENT OVER FORTY OF THE WORLD'S LEADING INTERNET BASED COMPANIES- AN ARMADA MISSION IS TO FOSTER INNOVATION PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH- EMPOWER PEOPLE SHOULD IT'S FREE AND OPEN INTERNET. HE REPRESENTED OF- MEMBERS INCLUDING MANY OF THE LEADING SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS- AND EVEN WITHIN THOSE COMPANIES THERE'S TREMENDOUS VARIATION- AMONG SOME- IN TERMS OF- THE MEDIUM OF THE CONTENT ON THE SIZE AND OTHER BUSINESS MODELS- BUT I WILL JUST ALSO POINT OUT THAT. MODERATION IMPACTS MORE THAN THAN SOCIAL MEDIA AND A VERY BROAD SENSE THERE ARE A LOT OF- WEBSITES PUBLICATIONS FORUMS BLOGS THAT HAVE TO MODERATE THEIR CONTENT- SO JUST WANTED TO QUICKLY POINT OUT THAT- WHILE WE ARE SPEAKING ABOUT THE SOCIAL. MEDIA CONTEXT- THAT WHEN WE'RE DESIGNING RULES AROUND CONTENT MODERATION I CAN BLEED OUT AND SAID THE INTERNET ECOSYSTEM- AND THANK YOU FOR. ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT TODAY- PEOPLE ARE USING IT AND SOCIAL MEDIA. CONNECT AND TRYING COMMUNITY LIKE NEVER BEFORE- AND TODAY'S WORLD HAS SHOWN BOTH THE TANGIBLE BENEFITS OF ONLINE SERVICES. AND THE CRITICAL ROLE PROVIDERS PLAN ENSURING THAT THEIR SERVICES ARE NOT UNDERMINED- AND MISUSED IN WAYS THAT THREATEN INDIVIDUAL LIVES ARE THE PUBLIC CRIED. OUT SOCIAL MEDIA HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE GLOBE TO STAY CONNECTED DURING THIS I'M GOING TO MAKE. THAT'S ALSO HELP FACILITATE THE ORGANIZATION OF UNPRECEDENTED PROTESTS FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE NOT JUST AND CALIFORNIANS NATION BUT- OUR WORLDWIDE- HOWEVER A NUMBER OF OUR USERS CONTINUE TO MISUSE OUR PLATFORMS TO MISLEAD. HARASS AND EXPLOIT OTHERS ENGAGE IN ILLICIT CONDUCT. I A MEMBER COMPANIES RECOGNIZE THAT IN ORDER TO REALIZE THE FULL BENEFITS OF THE INTERNET IT IS CRITICAL THAT THEY TAKE ACTION. TO PREVENT AND RESPOND TO HARMFUL ONLINE ACTIVITIES HI THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO BUILDING AND. MAINTAINING BOTH USER AND PUBLIC TRUST. OUR BEFORE GETTING IN OUR- CONTENT MODERATION AFTER AND FIRST LIKE TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT ABOUT SOME OF THE- ARE COMPANIES- WHEN MODERN CONTENT THE LAST. CONTENT MODERATION IS CHALLENGING COMPLEX AND NECESSARY WORK. EVERYDAY USERS POST BILLIONS OF PIECES OF CONTENT ONLINE- OVERWHELMINGLY OUR USERS POST PICTURES VIDEOS- BRITAIN IDEAS THAT ARE INFORMATIVE EDUCATIONAL INSPIRING HEARTWARMING. OFTENTIMES VERY FUNNY- IF YOU FOLLOW A LOT OF MEME PAGES- BUT GENERALLY- THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF CONTENT IS. A POLITICAL EVEN IN AN ELECTION YEAR- BUT EVERY MINUTE- AND IT'S ALL SPEAK FOR TEN MINUTES ARE YOU CAN DO THE MATH HERE BUT EVERY MINUTE. OTHER FOUR HUNDRED HOURS OF VIDEO UPLOADED TO YOUTUBE- THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TWEETS- THAT WILL BE SENT- AND SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND PHOTOS AND VIDEOS. WILL BE UPLOADED ON INSTAGRAM. AND LIKE I SAID WHILE MOST OF THE CONTENT ON OUR PLATFORM JUST FUNNY OR INFORMATIVE- OUR DIGITAL WORLD REALLY TENDS TO MIRROR THE REAL ONE- IN OTHER WORDS. ILLEGAL HATEFUL AND ABUSIVE CONTENT DIDN'T START ONLINE BUT AS INTERNET COMPANIES WE RECOGNIZE THAT OUR PLATFORMS CREATE NEW CHALLENGES FOR CITIZENS. PARENTS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND POLICY MAKERS. THE INTERNET INDUSTRY TAKES SERIOUSLY ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO MITIGATE THE SPREAD OF ILLEGAL HARMFUL AND UNWANTED CONTENT. TO BE VERY CLEAR WE DON'T TOLERATE MORE ONE ILLEGAL CONTENT OR CONTENT THAT VIOLATES OUR RULES ON OUR PLATFORMS FOR THAT HARMS OUR USERS. I REMEMBER COME TO TERMS OF SERVICE DO NOT PERMIT CONTENT THAT IS ILLEGAL AND EAST PLATFORM ESTABLISHES COMMUNITY GUIDELINES ABOUT HARMFUL CUTS. FOR COMPANIES CONTENT VIOLATES THEIR POLICIES THEY WILL ACT. IN MANY CASES ILLEGAL AND HARMFUL CONTENT IS BLOCKED BEFORE IT'S EVER POSTED. OR QUICKLY TAKEN DOWN. OUR COMPANIES HAVE COM JUST- SO AS A LOT OF SYSTEMS ARTIFICE INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE. WE'RE JUST SHUFFLING WITH WATER FOR MY VERY USED CONTEXT NECESSARY CONTEXT I WINNER VALUED IN GRAY AREAS- WITH OF HARMFUL CONTENT. ROSSI'S USER COMPLAINTS TO HELP SCREEN AND REMOVES CLOSE- IMAGES VIDEOS. OR OTHER CONTENT THAT VIOLATES THE LAW OR OUR COMMUNITY STANDARDS. ARE ONE USEFUL EXAMPLE- IS SPAM. AND SCAMS. SPAM AND CAMS WERE AMONG THE EARLIEST TARGETS OF PROACTIVE CONTENT MODERATION EFFORTS I'M AN EXAMPLE OF SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN KEEPING PACE WITH BAD ACTORS. ACCORDING TO THE COURT DETERMINED TO MISUSE OUR SERVICES- TRANSACTION HAS EVOLVED OVER TIME- FROM VERY SIMPLE TECHNIQUES SUCH AS BLOCK WEST. AND RATE LIMITING ON CERTAIN ACCOUNTS. TO MORE SOPHISTICATED AUTOMATED SYSTEMS BY MANY OF THE EARLY TECHNIQUES REMAIN IMPORTANT TOOLS I NEW ALGORITHMIC APPROACHES- THAT WHOLE SIGNALS FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES ARE CENTRAL TODAY TO KEEP UP. THE BATTLE BETWEEN SPAMMERS AND APART FROM CAN BE CHARACTERIZED AS ARMS RACE- ESTIMATES QUICKLY ADAPT TO DETECTION TECHNIQUES AND PROVIDERS MUST CONTINUALLY RESPOND- OUR COMPANIES HAVE APPLIED MANY OF THE TECHNIQUES AND LESSONS LEARNED FROM PROTECTING PEOPLE FROM BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF IN THIS CONTEXT. TO OTHER FORMS OF HARMFUL CONTENT. SO I WILL JUST PAUSE TO NOTE THAT MODERATION IS MUCH EASIER FOR ISSUES AND TOPICS THAT FALL INTO AN EASY DICHOTOMY. BY FORMS OF ILLEGAL CONTENT AND EVEN- SPAM. HOWEVER INCREASINGLY ARE ONLINE DISCOURSE FALLS INTO VARYING SHADES OF GRAY I'M PARTICULARLY IN AND MISINFORMATION. AND IDENTIFYING AND REMOVING VIOLATIVE CONTENT CAN BE INCREDIBLY SUBJECTIVE WORK. GIVEN THE ENORMOUS VOLUMEOF CONTENT ONLINE AND THE OFTENTIMES NUANCED DISTINCTIONS ABOUT WHETHER CONTENT VIOLATES COMMUNITY STANDARDS- I IS MEMBER COMPANIES WORK HARD TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN FACILITATING SPEECH- AND MITIGATING HARM. OUR MEMBER COMPANIES RECOGNIZE THAT THEY DO NOT ALWAYS ACHIEVES THE PERFECT BALANCE- BUT THEY'RE CONSTANTLY LEARNING AND ACTING NOT GETTING THEIR APPROACHES- WE ARE BY NO MEANS FIRST- AND THEY'RE ALL. BE ROOM FOR IMPROVED- WITH BILLION OF PIECES OF CONTENT EVERY DAY THERE WILL BE NO OF MISSED- INSTANCES WHERE WE- MISS CLASS. OR TO MAKE IT CHOI. ARE BOUND HAPPEN. WITH THE IMMENSE. OF CONTENT ON OUR PLATFORMS I JUST ON ONE PLATFORM ALONE IN ABOUT AN HOUR THE FIRST HOUR OF THIS PRESENTATION FOR EXAMPLE. THERE WERE ABOUT ONE POINT TWO MILLION PIECES OF CONTENT REMOVED FROM THE PLATFORM THAT VIOLATED RULES AND THAT'S- THAT DOESN'T SPEAK TO THE NUMBER OF DECISIONS THAT HAD TO BE MADE. ABOUT THINGS THAT WERE LAST UP. AND SO EVEN IF WE WERE NINETY NINE POINT 9% ACCURATE. THAT IS REMEMBER REMOVED NINETY NINE POINT 9% OF ALL CONTENT WE SHOULD HAVE REMOVED- AND WE LEFT AT NINETY NINE POINT 9% OF ALL CONTENT WE SHOULD'VE LEFT UP. I WE WOULD STILL BE MAKING MILLIONS OF MISTAKES EVERY WEEK. AND SO I SAY THIS TO JUST REINFORCE THAT BALANCING THE JUST INTEREST IS DIFFICULT- AND ESPECIALLY SO WHEN IT COMES TO MISINFORMATION ANOTHER SUBJECTIVE CATEGORIES. UNIVERSALLY X. THAT'S- OF HATE SPEECH MR. DON'T NECESSARILY EXIST AND IT CAN BE REALLY DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY- AND PEOPLE WILL DISAGREE- OFTEN AND- AS TO WHAT- WHETHER IT'S ALLOWED OR NOT UNDER OUR RULES- AND EVEN IF THERE WERE- UNIFIED DEFINITIONS BUT IS OFTEN VERY DIFFICULT TO OPERATIONALIZE- THESE VALUE JUDGMENTS ESPECIALLY AT THE SCALE. BOB AS NOTED BY PREVIOUS PANELISTS A SECTION TWO THIRTY IN THE FIRST AMENDMENT ENABLE ONLINE COMPANIES THE FLEXIBILITY TAKE ACTIONS AGAINST HARMFUL AND ILLEGAL CONTENT WITHOUT HAVING TO CHASE SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION. OR REGULATORY BURDENS WHICH WOULD DISCOURAGE INNOVATION AND INVESTMENT. AND THOSE INVESTMENTS WOULD CONTINUE MAKING THE INTERNET A BETTER SAFER EXPERIENCE FOR EVERYONE. IN THIS FLEXIBILITY ISSUE TO COMBAT IN CONSTANTLY EVOLVING- THREATS AND SO WITH THAT IN MIND I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS A FEW CONSIDERATIONS FOR THIS COMMITTEE- IT'S BEEN MENTIONED ALREADY BUT TRANSPARENCY REPORTING THIS IS JUST ONE ISSUE WITH AND CONCEPT MODERATION THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS CONSIDERED- IN THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION- AND MANY OF OUR PLATFORMS RECOGNIZE THE BENEFIT. OF INCREASED TRANSPARENCY. ABOUT THEIR CONTENT MODERATION EFFORTS- AND ALREADY REALLY SUBSTANTIAL TRANSPARENCY REPORTS AND HERE LIKE TO PAUSE AND JUST- SHARE A COUPLE QUICK SLIDES JUST AS A VISUAL- SO THAT EVERYBODY CAN SEE- SOME OF OUR OUR CURRENT EFFORTS AND IT WILL JUST CARRY OUT THIS- THESE ARE ONLY TWO OF OUR OUR COMPANIES. OUR RECORDS- AND THAT THERE IS A VARIETY BETWEEN WHAT IS BEING REPORTED- AND THE INFORMATION. ON THIS REPORT- SO HERE WE HAVE- FACEBOOK'S I'M STUCK QUARTER TO TWENTY ONE. THREE SAN AND FORCE THAT RIPPLE I'M THIS USUALLY FROM ON THIS WEBSITE BY. A GOOGLE SEARCH- YOU CAN FIND LINKS TO DOWNLOAD IT AT THE TOP- YOU'VE GOT LINKS TO ALL OF THE COMPANY'S POLICIES- THEREFORE SPENT WITH EXPLANATIONS ARE APPROACH ON HOW THEY'RE DOING THIS. DATA AS WELL TO- SHOW- STE SURE THE WORK THERE- YOU CAN ALSO BREAK OUT- THE AMOUNT OF MODERATION BY- POLICY AEA. AND WITHIN EACH THERE ARE DEFINITIONS. OF HOW THEY'RE CATEGORIZING CONTENT AS WELL AS THE DAY OF THE FALL LINE UP- HERE'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF HONEST WHEN YOU CLICK CONTINUE- ADULT NUDITY AND SEXUAL ACTIVITY. I'M SHOWING THE PREVALENCE AND ON FACEBOOK- AND SO- HERE'S A QUICK EXAMPLE OF TWITTER'S- TRANSPARENCY REPORT. SURE AND- YOU KNOW THE FAR GROUSED AND HOW MANY- CANCER ACTION. AND AS YOU GO INTO IT THERE'S NARRATIVE EXPLANATION- OF THEIR EFFORTS- AND THEY ALSO BREAK IT OUT BY BY EACH AREA. AND SO- THERE IS. YOU KNOW NATURALLY THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME VARIATION. AMONG SOME BUT REALLY OUR COMPANIES ARE TRYING TO. INVEST VERY HEAVILY AND- THESE REPORTS ARE AIMED AT INFORMING OUR USERS- WE HAVE NO INTEREST IN AND- I'M NOT INFORMING OUR USERS WE WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND WHAT IS. ALLOWED AND ACCEPTABLE ON OUR OUR PLATFORMS. AND SO WE'VE BROKEN UP INTO HEADERS THEY'RE SEARCHABLE- YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE DATA FOR YOURSELF- A LOT OF THEM INCORPORATE CRAFT SOME OF THEM ARE ARE MORE INTERACTIVE THAN OTHERS BUT- WE ARE WORKING TO IMPROVE. THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT WITH EVERY REPORT- AND SO WE'VE ENGAGED WITH THIS COMMITTEE TO DEVELOP A WORKABLE TRANSPARENCY BILL. WE'RE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING NOT OUT FOR- I WILL DISCUSSION THAT YOU KNOW OFTENTIMES ONE SIZE FITS ALL BROUGH- LEAD TO SOME. ISSUES AS FAR. AS THE INFORMATION THAT'S THAT'S PRESENTED- COME HAVE VERY DIFFERENT CAPABILITIES AS FAR AS- THE RESOURCE THAT THEY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THESE F. AND ALSO TRYING TO COME. ACROSS PLATFORM CAN ALSO BE TRICK AND MAY LEAD TO- SOME FIRST. AS FAR AS WHAT. IMPLICATIONS YOU CAN GLEAN- SETS OF- I WILL SAY THOUGH THAT WE'VE BEEN WARY OF- PREVIOUS REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE COULD FORCE US TO DISCLOSE TOO MUCH. INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PROCESSES LIKE I MENTIONED WE'RE COMBATING- A LOT OF VERY SOPHISTICATED ONLINE ACTORS ON PEOPLE TRYING TO TRAFFIC DRUGS OR RECRUITS FOR TERRORIST ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATIONS- AND IT DOESN'T SERVE ANYBODY TO PROVIDE ROAD MAPS TO THESE KINDS OF PEOPLE- I'D ALSO CAUTION AGAINST. A SPECIALIZED RULES FOR SPECIFIC CONTENT CONTENT OR I KIND OF FIND PERFORMANCE TARGETS. ON THINGS LIKE TIME LIMITS OR SPECIAL HANDLING RULES AND ACTUALLY HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES- IN TERMS OF- ALLOCATING RESOURCES BUT ALSO- AS IT AS I MENTIONED THIS IS A BALANCING INTERESTING WHEN YOUR- INCENTIVIZE TO TAKE DOWN MORE CONTENT YOU'RE GOING TO- AND- RETHINK IT RESULT. IN A DRASTIC OVER REMOVAL- AND THE COURTS AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS AND FOUND THAT AS WELL- SO. I'LL CLOSE BY REITERATING THAT THAT CONTENT MODERATION AT SCALE IS AN IMMENSE CHALLENGE BUT ONE ARE COMPANIES ARE TACKLING HEAD ON- AND- SERIOUS ABOUT CONTINUING TO IMPROVE. UPON BUT POLICY PROPOSAL SHOULD BE NARROWLY TAILORED WITH AN EXISTING LEGAL. FRAMEWORKS OVER ABILITY TO ADAPT. TO EVER CHANGE- THREATS AT AN ADDRESS NEWS ON IN. AND THANK YOU- FOR ALLOWING ME PARTICIPATE TODAY I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER. ANY THANK MISTER HOFFMAN ON NEXT JEFF ALEX. OF INTO IN. A FORMER SENIOR LEVEL DATA SCIENTIST IT AT FACEBOOK. BOB DR ALAN. I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LETTING ME PARTICIPATE- AND SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE INTEGRITY INSTITUTE- I'M GOING TO SHARE A FEW QUICK SLIDES A HOPELESS WANTED TO ALL. I'M SO. YOU SEE BACKGROUND ON THE INTEGRITY INSTITUTE IN WHO WE REPRESENTS- WE ARE A GROWING COMMUNITY OF INTEGRITY PROFESSIONALS- WHICH MEANS PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY HAVE EXPERIENCE WORKING ON THE PLATFORMS FOR SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES TRYING TO MITIGATE THE HARMS THAT CAN OCCUR ON THE PLATFORMS OR BECAUSE BY THE PLATFORMS- WE ARE OPTIMISTIC WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A SOCIAL INTERNET THAT CAN HELP SOCIETIES DEMOCRACIES AN INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHTS- CAN WE ARE TRYING TO USE OUR COMMUNITY WE ARE POWERED BY OUR COMMUNITY- HAS WE TRY TO HELP ALL STAKEHOLDERS- IN IN SOCIAL MEDIA. I'M TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THIS- SO I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT- ARE WHAT REPRESENTS THE CONSENSUS VIEW OF OUR COMMUNITY- OF INTEGRITY PROFESSIONALS. MEANING THESE ARE ALL POINTS THAT WE HAVE MET AND DSCUSSED IN DETAIL- AND THERE'S BROAD CONSENSUS AMONG OUR MEMBERS WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY HAVE AGAIN PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY TRIED TACKLING THESE PROBLEMS FROM WITHIN THE PLATFORMS THEMSELVES- WE BELIEVE THAT INCREASE TRANSPARENCY. IS THE EXTREMELY VALUABLE TOOL AND WHEN EMPLOYMENT IT COMPREHENSIVELY AND WELL. THE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES AND ALSO TO VALIDATE THAT AND ENSURE THAT THEY'RE USING BEST PRACTICES ARE RESPONSIBLY BUILDING OUR PLATFORMS. AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE RIGHT TRANSPARENCY CAN HELP ELEVATE THE INFLUENCE OF THE INTERNAL TEAMS THAT ARE TRYING TO MINIMIZE THE HARMS THAT OCCUR ON THE PLATFORMS- IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE THINK THAT TRANSPARENCY IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP BUT IT'S ALSO NOT THE- ONLY STOP- AND THEN YOU KNOW OUR ORGANIZATIONS DURING NEW AND THIS IS SORT OF LIKE THE FIRST CONCEPT THAT WE HAVE TACKLED. FOR PUBLIC. I'M TRANSPARENCY CAN TAKE MANY DIFFERENT FORMS I'M AND ONE THING TO STRESS IS THAT WE NEED AT MANY DIFFERENT FORMS. IMPORTANT FOR TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS TO BE VERY COMPREHENSIVE TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S NO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FROM FROM VARIOUS- IN CENTER UNINTENDED INCENTIVES CREATED WITHIN THE COMPANY- WE WANT TO CREATE AN ACTUAL INCENTIVE STRUCTURE THAT YOU KNOW LEADS TO BETTER BUSINESS DECISIONS- AT LEAST CELESTE FARMS ON THE PLATFORMS AND SO WE REALLY NEED TO BE COMPREHENSIVE AND WIDE RANGING WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE TRANSPARENCY NEED. TO DO THAT- SO ON THAT FRONT THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT FORMS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE PLATFORMS- UTILIZE WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THEY'RE MAKING THEMSELVES MORE TRANSPARENT. THE FIRST IS AGGREGATED AND SUMMARY DATA. AND SO ON THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE TRANSPARENCY REPORTS- THAT WERE JUST SHOWN BY THE- THE PROCEEDING- SPEAKER HI AND CAN INCLUDE DATA SUCH AS- THE NUMBER OF USERS WHO WERE EXPOSED TO HARMFUL CONTENT- AND WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE THE FREQUENCY OF EXPOSURE SO HOW OFTEN ORDER USERS REPEATEDLY EXPOSED TO HARMFUL CONTENT. OR OUR COMMUNITY STANDARDS VIOLATING CONTENT. I'M TRANSPARENCY CAN ALSO NEEDS TO COME IN THE FORM OF CONTENT BASED DATASETS- AND SO THESE WOULD BE PUBLIC RELEASES OF CONTENT ON THE PLATFORM. AN EXAMPLE THAT WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE AND WE THINK WOULD UNLOCK A LOT OF VALUABLE RESEARCH- IS A RANDOM SAMPLE OF YOU KNOW THOUSANDS OF IMPRESSIONS ON PUBLIC CONTACT- THIS WOULD CREATE A- STANDARDIZED DATASET- THAT EVERYONE COULD AGREE- AGREE UPON AND AS REPRESENTATIVE OF WHAT USERS ARE SEEN ON THE PLATFORM AT LEAST IN THE PUBLIC CONTENT SPACE- AND INTEGRATE MORE. MORE STRUCTURED CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN BUT THE PLATFORMS- AND EXTERNAL BECAUSE HE WORKS- WE'D ALSO LIKE TO SEE DETAILS AND DESCRIPTIONS OF ALGORITHMS THAT ARE USED ON THE PLATFORMS AS WELL AS THE OVERALL PLATFORM DESIGN. AND AN EXAMPLE OF THIS COULD BE YOU KNOW WHAT CLASSIFIERS WHAT MACHINE LEARNING MODELS ARE BEING USED IN THE RANKING OF CONTENT IN FEEDS- YOU KNOW AND IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING EXAMPLE WOULD BE YOU KNOW WHAT USER ENGAGEMENT ACTIONS ARE THE PLATFORMS TRYING TO PREDICT. AND HOW DO THOSE PREDICTIONS- CHANGE THAT THE ORDERING OF CONTENT IN THEIR FEEDS. AND FINALLY AND VERY IMPORTANTLY WE'D LIKE TO SEE DETAILS AND DESCRIPTIONS OF INTERNAL COMPANY PROCESS SEATS AROUND% DECISION MAKING- AN EXAMPLE HERE COULD BE A DISCLOSURE OF THE METRICS THAT COMPANIES USE IN THEIR EXPERIMENTATION PROCESS AND FOR GOALS. SO WHAT ARE THE METRICS THAT INTERNAL TEAMS ARE USING WHEN THEY MAKE DECISIONS YOU KNOW IN AB TEST WHETHER OR NOT TO SHIP A NEW FEATURE OR NOT- COMPANIES VERY REGULARLY USE METRICS- IN KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS- TO TELL IF IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO SHIPPING TO FEATURE- AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE TRANSPARENCY FROM COMPANIES ON WHAT ARE THE METRICS THAT THEY USED TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. AND WHAT ARE THE METRICS THAT THEY USED TO SET GOALS FOR TEAMS LIKE WHAT IS THE COMPANY ACTUALLY TRYING TO DRIVE- THIS WAS JUST A BRIEF TASTE LIKE. TRANSPARENCY REALLY NEEDS TO BE CAUGHT- COMPREHENSIVE THERE'S A LOT OF TECHNICAL DETAILS- AND AT THE INTEGRITY INSTITUTE WE ARE A COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE WORKING ON. WORKING ON THE PLATFORMS ON THESE PROBLEMS. AND WE WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO HELP ALL STAKEHOLDERS WHICH INCLUDES THE COMPANIES THEMSELVES AS WELL AS POLICYMAKERS. UNDERSTAND ALL THESE ISSUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU A DOCTOR ALLEN. A NEXT- PROFESSOR KATE. KLONDIKE ST JOHN'S FROM SAINT JOHN'S UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL AFFILIATE FELLOW AT THE INFORMATION SOCIETY PROJECT AT YALE LAW SCHOOL. PROFESSOR CLONIC. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME- I'M GOING TO KEEP HIS PRETTY SHORT BECAUSE THINGS HAVE KIND OF BEEN A LITTLE BIT LONG AND I AM EAGER TO TRY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS IF I CAN BE HELPFUL AND ALSO I WAS DEFINITELY NOT INVITED TO THIS- PICKED TO BE PART OF THIS PANEL BECAUSE I AM A BARD CALIFORNIA LAWYER WHICH I AM NOT A PRACTICE IN NEW YORK AB AND I'VE NEVER DONE SO I JUST TAUGHT AND- AND NOT BECAUSE I'M A CITIZEN OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I'M ALSO NOT THAT SO I JUST WANT TO STATE THAT- MY ADVICE HERE IS GOING TO COME FROM BASICALLY MY EXPERIENCE AND IT WHICH IS WHY I THINK I WAS INVITED HERE TODAY. WHICH IS AS A RESEARCHER AND A SCHOLAR AND ACADEMIC AND I THINK WHAT I REALLY KIND OF WANNA BE THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO TAKE AWAY AS A SCHOOL AS A AS A SCHOLAR OF TRANSLATING BETWEEN TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS AND TECHNOLOGISTS AND- LAWMAKERS IN A REALLY UNIQUE TIME IN HISTORY WHERE THERE NEEDS TO BE A LOT OF HARD TRANSLATED TRANSLATED WORK- TO FIGURE OUT HOW THESE COMPANIES WHICH ARE VERY COMPLEX AND LEARNING IN MUCH DIFFERENT WAYS THAN OIL COMPANY IS OR EVEN AUTO MANUFACTURERS- TO IMPACT PEOPLE'S LIVES AND TO IMPACT THEIR RIGHTS- IN CRITICAL WAYS. AND I THINK THOSE TYPES OF UNDERSTANDINGS ARE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO CRAFTING GOOD LEGISLATION- IN THE LONG TERM AND INTERVENTIONS. SO I WOULD SAID I SPENT A LOT OF TIME BOTH INSIDE. TALKING TO FORMER MEMBER FORMER EMPLOYEES AT TWITTER FACEBOOK GOOGLE YOUTUBE PINTEREST AIRBNB A LOT OF. THE MAJOR AND MINOR- FIRMS THAT TRAFFIC AND KIND OF MAKING- SPEECH AVAILABLE TO. THEM AS MOST AS MANY USERS AS POSSIBLE AND I WOULD ALSO ENDEAVOR TO FIND OUT. HOW MANY OF THOSE USERS FALL OUTSIDE THE U. S. NEVER MIND CALIFORNIA- AND SO ACTUALLY ONLY ONLY 79% OF USERS ARE BASED IN THE US. MOST OF THEM ARE IN FACT BASED. OUTSIDE OUR BORDERS AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S JUST THE IMPORTANT THING TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT AS WORK. I'M SITTING HERE TODAY DISCUSSING KIND OF HOW. TO POTENTIALLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THESE PLATFORMS AND CHANGE HOW. THEY THEY RUN THEIR COMPANY IS. THAT THE IMPACT THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IS NOT GOING TO JUST BE I'M ON U. S. CITIZENS JUST AS THE GDPR WAS NOT JUST ON YOU SAID A SENSE- AND THAT THERE ARE FACTS THAT. THAT IN CALIFORNIA HAS THAT CARRY FAR OUTSIDE. ITS BOUNDARIES I'M STILL REALLY QUICKLY I'VE SPENT TIME INSIDE FACEBOOK AND MOST RECENTLY- I WAS EMBEDDED AS BOTH THE JOURNALISTS AND ACADEMICS COVERING ITS- DEVELOPMENT- THE FACEBOOK OVERSIGHT BOARD AND I BRING THIS UP BECAUSE- THAT THE PATENT THE PANEL. THAT I'M SPEAKING ON. IS ASKING THE QUESTION WHAT IS BEING DONE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND I THINK THAT- I COULDN'T. TESTIFIED TO THIS TWO YEARS AGO I COULD HAVE SAID THAT THIS IS HAPPENING BUT I COULDN'T SAID WERE MEDICALLY WHETHER HOW IT WAS GOING BECAUSE THAT DIDN'T EXIST YET. AND HADN'T BEEN SET UP- AND HADN'T BEEN TESTED BUT I CAN THINK I CAN SAY NOW THAT THE FACEBOOK OVERSIGHT BOARD SO FAR HAS BEEN I'M A PRETTY I'M- INCREDIBLE SUCCESS. IN TERMS OF STARTING TO CREATE A CULTURE OF TRANSPARENCY- CONSOLIDATED SIGNALS BACK TO FACEBOOK. ON WHAT USERS WANT TO HEAR AND HOLDING IT HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES WHICH IS WHAT USERS ALL BASED AND A- COMMITTEE IT CAME UP. WHEN THE OVERSIGHT BOARD AND PLACE- THAT IT WANTED AND SO JUST. IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR THE FACEBOOK FOR IT'S KIND OF BEEN CO. REFER TO AS- FACEBOOK'S A CREAM COURT SHOULD HEAL OR HERE'S APPEALS- BOTH DIRECTLY FROM FACEBOOK FACEBOOK REQUESTS THAT IT HERE BUT ALSO FROM USERS AND ALLOWS THEM TO APPEAL TAKEDOWNS AND- A K. NOW- KEEP OPS. OF MATERIAL THEY THINK SHOULD COME DOWN- TO A HIGHER BODY OF TWENTY GLOBAL- ACADEMICS LAWYERS JOURNALISTS SCHOLARS- TECHNOLOGISTS. THAT ALL KIND OF LOOK TO- IT TO PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN RIGHTS THE FOCUS BOOKS OWN COMMUNITY STANDARDS AND VALUES. AND TRY TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT- CERTAIN KIND OF OBJECTIVE MEASURES OF THREE CONVICTS RUSSIAN AND OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS ARE BEING. TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WITH SOME OF THESE DECISIONS AND THE POLICIES OF FACEBOOK I'M MOST RECENTLY HE PROBABLY BECAME AWARE OF THEM BECAUSE- THEY WERE. THEY WERE GIVEN THE DECISION ON WHETHER DONALD TRUMP'S PLATFORM SHOULD NOT REMAIN DOWN. AND THEY WROTE. I THINK A VERY INCREDIBLY ELEGANT AND- THOUGHTFUL AND LEGALLY BASED- OPINION. THAT BASICALLY KICKED THE QUESTION BACK TO FACEBOOK SAYING THAT THEY WERE NOT GOING TO CREATE CONTENT BASED SUBSTANTIVE TYPES OF ROLES FOR FACEBOOK ON HOW TO POLICE PUBLIC FIGURES OR TRY TO DEFINE PUBLIC FIGURES OR TRY TO DEFINE EACH THESE COMPLETELY NEBULOUS IDEAS OF NEWSWORTHINESS- A FOR FACEBOOK AND- TO DO THAT HARD JOB FOR IT- THEY WERE JUST GOING TO DEMAND. THAT FACEBOOK HAVE TRANSPARENT POLICIES MAKE CLEAR- CONCENTRATED DECISIONS AND THOSE DECISIONS BE PROPORTIONAL I'M FROM A HUMAN RIGHTS PERSPECTIVE- IN TERMS OF THE PUNISHMENT. METED OUT TO THE ADDED TO THE CRIME. AND SO I THINK THAT- I THINK THIS IS A ROOM. KIND OF NEW YORK. IT IS IN FUNDED THROUGH A THREE MILLION DOLLAR GRANT HI EXCUSE ME A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR GRANT THE FACEBOOK MADE. YOUR AVAILABLE TO YOU- I TRUST THAT IT SET UP THAT IS MANAGED BY INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES- AND THAT GOVERNS THE OVERSIGHT BOARD WHICH IS MANAGED ITSELF THE BOARD OF. THE TWENTY PERSON BOARD THAT I MENTIONED IS MANAGED BY A AND AN LLC IS BASED IN DELAWARE. AND ACTIVELY IT SET UP TO RUN RIGHT NOW FOR SIX YEARS- SO FAR BY PLACING KIND OF THE REPUTATIONS OF ALL OF THE BOARD MEMBERS- MOST. WHICH RANGE FROM NOBEL PRIZE WINNERS TO THAT FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF DENMARK YOU ARE YOU AND YOU DROP IT TOWARDS YOU- THE FORMER EDITOR IN CHIEF OF THE GUARDIAN AND ATTEND CIRCUIT JUDGES. THERE IS. A JUST A WIDE RANGE OF EXPERTISE AND REPUTATION AND WHAT YOU'VE SEEN AS BUT WHEN MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS GOING TO PROVIDE. A SCAPEGOAT FOR FACEBOOK. BUT INSTEAD WERE YOU SEEN AS ALL OF THE IN THE- ARE VERY MUCH STEP UP AND SAID WE ARE NOT WILLING TO PLACE OUR REPUTATION LIES IN FOR THIS KIND OF GOAL. AND INSTEAD WE'RE GOING TO DO EXACTLY WHAT WE WERE MANDATED TO DO BY- HE'S FOUNDING DOCUMENTS. I'M WE ARE GOING TO HOLD FACEBOOK ACCOUNTABLE IN A SMALL WAY- TO TRY TO MAKE THIS SPACE BETTER AND TO TRY TO GET YOU BACK SIGNALED THE HOW TO MAKE YOUR PLATFORM BETTER FOR YOUR USERS. AND THAT AND WHILE HOLDING KIND OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND- THE STANDARD FACEBOOK'S AS FAR. SO THAT BEING SAID- THERE HAS BANNED I THINK JUST GENERALLY MUCH MORE INDEPENDENT AND MUCH MORE ROBUST THAN MANY OF US IMAGINE INCLUDING ME I WAS CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC- BUT I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT IT'S GOTTEN TO THIS POINT THERE'S A LOT OF INSTITUTION BUILDING THAT JUST NEEDED TO GET DONE AT LIKE A VERY FOUNDATIONAL LEVEL. OR SOMETHING OF THAT SCALE TO. PLAY EVEN HEAR APPEALS FROM A GLOBAL AUDIENCE THEY KIND OF THEY HAVE TO SELECT- CASES THAT ARE. I LIKE IT ASTRONOMICALLY LIKE AT AN ASTRONOMICAL LEAVES SMALL AMOUNTS ARE GIVEN THE AMOUNT THAT APPEALED THROUGH THEM AND THAT'S INCREDIBLY HARD WORK AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT AND EVERYTHING ELSE. SO I JUST I THINK IT'S ONE EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF EIGHT EIGHT YOURSELF REGULATORY MECHANISM BUT IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE SELF REGULATORY. FACEBOOK DID THIS ON ITS OWN. BUT THERE IS NO REASON THAT THIS COULD NOT BE MANDATED. BY BY GOVERNMENT IN FACT CANADA IS IN THE PROCESS OF BASICALLY WRITING A MANDATE INTO- INTO A BOX THAT WOULD REQUIRE- SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES A CERTAIN SIZE TO HAVE THIS TYPE. OF A BOARD- AND SO IT IS ONE MECHANISM OF GOVERNANCE THAT KIND OF GIVES POWER BACK TO USERS WHICH I THINK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING- A FOR ANY TYPE OF GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION TO DO. IS TO NOT NECESSARILY SPEECH THE CONTENT ITSELF BUT THE ABILITY OF THE USER CONTENT TO THAT. I WILL JUST SAY THAT I OUT ON. EVERYONE'S PLATE- DESIRE FROM- TRANSPARENCY COME. ARE ALREADY. THAT THEY COULD DO MORE OF IT AND THEY GIVE MORE OF A DISCUSSION SCIENCES. THANK ME AND A LOT OF. AND THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE KIND OF MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING IT YOU'VE SEEN A LOT OF THEM TODAY THAT ARE DOING THE VERY HARD WORK OF TRANSLATING BETWEEN. THE TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES UNDER SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF SILICON VALLEY. AND YOU KNOW AND THE AND- A VERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF LANGUAGE THAT. WERE YEARS TWENTY C. OR NEW YORK OR ANYWHERE ELSE. AND TRANSLATING IT BACK LAWMAKERS AROUND THE WORLD AND THAT IS- THE MORE OF THAT WE CAN HAVE THE BETTER AND I'M REALLY APPRECIATIVE THAT I GET SAYS COME HERE TODAY. AND KIND OF SHARE SOME OF THAT KNOWLEDGE AND PROVIDE THAT ROLLED. TO THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME. THANK YOU PROFESSOR IN AND JUST A HEADS UP TO YOU AND THE OTHER PANELISTS I'M GONNA COME BACK AT THE END. AND ASK IN LIGHT OF THE TESTIMONY OF. OF MISS KELLER IN PROFESSOR GOLDMAN WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO IN TERMS OF TRANSPARENCY WHAT CAN WE DO IN TERMS OF MODERATION. WHAT CAN WE DO- IN TERMS OF. TRANSPARENCY REGARDING THE AMPLIFICATION OF CERTAIN MESSAGES SO WHAT WILL COME BACK TO THAT BUT JUST GIVING YOU ALL A HEADS UP. NEXT IMRAN AHMED THE CEO OF THE CENTER FOR COUNTERING DIGITAL HATE. THANK YOU MR AHMED FOR JOINING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAME IS IMRAN AHMED I'M CHIEF EXECUTIVE THE SCENT OF THE COUNTRY AND DIGITAL LIGHT BASED IN WASHINGTON DC- ALL OF THE EVIDENCE OF THE GENTLEMAN FROM SILICON VALLEY I DON'T KNO ABOUT YOU BUT- I'M STILL NOT PERSUADED. I MEAN YOU GOT GENOCIDE IN MYANMAR ALL. AN ACT OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM WHICH ENDED WITH THE CAPSULE BEING STORMED. AND YET APPARENTLY DROPPED ON HIS ALL ABOUT. NOTHING TO SEE HERE YEAH. MY ORGANIZATION THE CENTER FOR COUNTERING DIGITAL HEIGHT WAS SET UP TO DISRUPT THE WORK OF MALIGNANT ACTORS NLINE. BUT ALSO TO ACCELERATE THE MOMENT WHEN BIG TECH HAS TO FINALLY TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. FOR THE FACT THAT AT THE SAME TIME IT CONNECTS FAMILIES LOVED ONES FRIENDS AND YOU COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST. IT ALSO HAS POWERED MODERN EXTREMISM. SCIENCE DENIAL HATRED. BULLYING TERRORISM A HOST OF REAL WORLD HARMS. LOOK IN THE PAST YEAR THE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES HAVE FACED THREE TESTS. ONE WAS THE ELECTION MISINFORMATION THAT MOB THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION I LEAD TO THE STORMING OF THE CAPSULE. FAILED ANOTHER WAS TO DO SOMETHING TO STOP THE CRISIS MENTAL HEALTH PARTICULARLY AFFECTING OUR YOUNG WOMEN. FAILED I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I'D RATHER TRUST MY KIDS WITH PRINCE ANDREW BUT INSTAGRAM'S ALGORITHMS FRANKLY. BUT THE CALVET CONDEMNING IN PARTICULAR HAS LAID BAD THE EXISTING REAL WORLD HARMS CAUSED BY ONLINE MISINFORMATION ON THE SYSTEMATIC FAILURE OF SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO PROTECT THAT USES FROM THOSE HARMS. AND THERE HAS BEEN A QUANTIFIABLE DEATH TOLL. MULTIPLE STUDIES INCLUDING OUR OWN HAVE SHOWN THAT THOSE WHO ARE MOST RELIANT ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR INFORMATION ALL MORE VACCINE HESITANT. BIG TECH IS PROVEN ITS POTENTIAL DETRIMENTAL TO PUBLIC HEALTH. AND IT REQUIRES SCRUTINY. IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY I PIVOTED THE SENSES RESEARCH IS AN IMPACT STUFF TO FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON CORONAVIRUS AND PRESCIENTLY. ANTI VACCINE MISINFORMATION ACTIVES IN THAT TIME CCH HAS REPEATEDLY DEMONSTRATED BUT THE PLATFORM SYSTEMS FOR PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF HARMFUL MISINFORMATION I'M NOT WORKING. THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE SYSTEMS THEY HAVE DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF HATRED SUCH AS THE ANTI BLACK RACISM. ANTI SEMITISM MISOGYNY. IN SHORT WHAT CCH IS FOUND IS THAT PLATFORMS WHEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN MY FAILURES OR EVEN CORRECT THE HOMES THEY SAID- COMPANIES CHOOSE TO EMPLOY A PLAYBOOK OF DENY CULPABILITY DEFLECTS CRITICISM AND DELAY ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. WE SEE HOW MUCH THE CLASS OF THAT IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS BOTH IN THE U. K. E. I'M IN THE US WITH THE ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT ON LOBBYING TO STOP REGULATION FROM HAPPENING OR AT LEAST BEND IT TO THEIR INTERESTS. IT FOR EXAMPLE PLATFORMS OFTEN CLAIM THAT THEY REMOVE HARMFUL CONTENT WHAT IS REPORTED TO THEM BUT THIS IS SIMPLY UNTRUE. ALL REGULAR ORDER IS A PLATFORM ACTION ON REPORTS OF HARMFUL HATE MISINFORMATION SHOW THAT THEY FAILED TO ACT ON AROUND EIGHTEEN TEN POSTS THAT ARE REPORTED TO THEM USING THEIR OWN TOOLS THAT BOUGHT IT LAST ON. IT'S NOT JUST VACCINE OKAY MISINFORMATION OR EVEN HATE THAT'S THE PROBLEM. ALL RECENT FAILURE TO PROTECT REPORT SHOWED THAT FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM TICTOC TWITTER AND YOUTUBE FAILED TO ACT ON IT 84% OF USER REPORTS OF **** LEVEL ANTI SEMITIC CONTENT. SO YOU REPORTED TO THEM ON. THE EIGHTEEN TEN TIMES THEY FAILED TO DO ANYTHING. FACEBOOK WAS THE WORST OF ALL FAILING TO ACTUAL NINE IN TEN REPORTS DESPITE CLAIMING TO ADOPT STRONGER POLICIES ON THE ANTI SEMITIC CONSPIRACIES. IN HOLOCAUST DENIAL IN THE LAST YEAR. BUT LOST. AS COUNTRIES THE WORLD AND IN THE SECOND WAVE INDICATED PANDEMIC INSTAGRAM SIGNED IT TO START PLACING OUT WITH ME RECOMMENDED POSTS. AT THE BOSTON OF USERS FEEDS. THEY HAVEN'T TAKEN EVEN THE MOST BASIC STEPS TO PREVENT THIS FEATURE HOWEVER FROM PROMOTING HARMFUL HATE MISINFORMATION. ALL REPORT MELDRICK THEN ESTABLISHED A SERIES OF INSTAGRAM PROFILES FOLLOWING THE ACCOUNTS OF WELLNESS INFLUENCES WHICH RECEIVED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DISINFORMATION FROM LEADING ONLINE ON TWO TRACKS IT'S- ALREADY BEEN REPEATEDLY FLAG TO INSTAGRAM ADVANCE OF ITS ROLLOUT. INSTAGRAM WAS ALSO SHOWN TO BE DRIVING A DANGEROUS CONVERGENCE OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMPLICATED MISINFORMATION SO FOLLOWS ON TO FAX ACCOUNTS WERE RECOMMENDED ANTI SEMITIC CONTENT SHE WENT ON CONSPIRACIES AND ELECTION MISINFORMATION AND IN RETURN FOLLOWS A FAR RIGHT ACCOUNTS RECOMMENDED CONVENE AND MAX UNCONFIDENT VACCINE MISINFORMATION. SO THIS PURPOSE PROBLEM IS NOT UNIQUE TO INSTAGRAM IT'S TRUE FACEBOOK AS WELL AND ALL THE OTHER PLATFORMS. THE FRONT OF THE PLATFORMS WHAT I'M TRYING I'M TO TAXES ON THE DISINFORMATION THEY SPREAD HELPS EXPLAIN RAPID UNCHECKED GROWTH DURING THE PANDEMIC. TRACKING A HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN ACCOUNTS FOR WHICH EASIER IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO OBTAIN HISTORICAL FIGURES SHOWING THAT THEY'VE GROWN BY TEN POINT ONE MILLION FOLLOWERS SINCE THE END OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. ANTI BREXIT COUNCIL INSTAGRAM REFRESHED IS ADDING FOUR POINT THREE MILLION FOLLOWERS. MARIMBA DESPITE HAVING DENIED IT WILL REVEAL AS THIS WAS ALL CONFIRMED BY THE FACEBOOK WHISTLEBLOWER FRANCIS WHO. LEAKED DOCUMENTS PROVED FACEBOOK STUFF NEW THEIR ALGORITHMS COULD SEND USERS DOWN A RABBIT HOLE CONSPIRACIES IN THIS LIST LIST TWO DATES. TO BE CLEAR. MAINSTREAM SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS THE ONE WE USE THE WHAT KIDS USE NAMELY FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM TICTOC ETCETERA I'M GONNA FIND THE PROBLEM OF HAITIAN MISINFORMATION. AND AIDING AND ABETTING THOSE WHO BREAK THE RULES. BIG TECH CONTINUALLY SHIFT RESPONSIBILITY OF CONTENT MODERATION TO USES. AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH IS NOT THE CENTER WITH LIMITED ACCESS TO THE PLATFORM AND THEN AGGRESSIVELY COUNTERS ANY CRITIQUES OF FINDINGS THAT RESEARCHERS ON A- CONTENT CIRCULATING ON THE LARGEST PLATFORM. PLAYS AN OUTSIZE ROLE IN SHAPING THE TERMS OF PUBLIC DISCOURSE IN SOME OF THESE PLATFORMS HAVE A SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY TO BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT THE CONTENT THAT IS MOST VIEWED AND MOST ENGAGED WITH. ESPECIALLY IF IT'S HARMFUL CONTENT SUCH AS MEDICAL MISINFORMATION MISOGYNIST ABUSE OR RACIAL HATRED. BUT IN REALITY PLATFORMS IT DENIED IN SOME CASES DIRECTLY CHALLENGE SEASON YET FOR OUR FINDINGS NOT WITH THE COMPLICATION OF HUMBLE CONTENT ON THE PROLIFERATION OF COVERED IMPACTS THE MISINFORMATION ON THE SITES. INTERNAL LEAKS FROM FACEBOOK TO THE WALL STREET JOURNAL CONFIRM THAT A SMALL NUMBER OF. WHALES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BULK OF ANTI VACCINE CONTENT ON THE PLATFORM WHAT. WE FOUND LIKE MANY PROBLEMS AT FACEBOOK THE THIS IS A HEAD HEAVY PROBLEM WITH A RELATIVELY FEW NUMBER OF FACT IS CREATING A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE CONTENT RIGHT. ANOTHER QUOTE TOP PRODUCES A MOSTLY USES SERIALLY POSTING CONTENT TO FEET. AND QUOTES. A C. C. H. I. TEND TO FOR THOSE BIG WHALES THE DISINFORMATION DOESN'T FIRST IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. A REPORT ON THE DISINFORMATION DOESN'T WHICH I KNOW I SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND PIECES OF ANTI VACCINE CONTENT POSTED OR SHARED TO FACEBOOK. OVER A PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS FOUND THAT 73% ABOUT CONTACT ORIGINATED FROM JUST TWELVE INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR ORGANIZATIONS. PRESIDENT CLINTON WAS REFERENCING OUR RESEARCH WHERE HE SAID FACEBOOK CELLISTS. HE SUBSEQUENTLY WAS PERSUADED TO- COOL HIS JETS BUT FEELS LIKE SOMETHING YOU WOULD SAY. ON FACEBOOK AND REINFORCED THE DOZEN KILLING PEOPLE BUT HE DID FOLLOW IMMEDIATELY WITH THE MORAL PEACH PLEA TO THE PLATFORMS THIS IS WHAT HE SAID PUT. THESE TWELVE PEOPLE AROUND THAT GIVING MISINFORMATION. ANYONE LISTEN TO IT IS GETTING HURT BY IT IT'S KILLING PEOPLE I'M TRYING TO MAKE PEOPLE LOOK AT THEMSELVES LOOK IN THE MIRROR. THINK ABOUT THAT MISINFORMATION GOING TO YOUR SON YOUR DAUGHTER YOUR RELATIVES. AND QUITE. DID FACEBOOK ACT. NOTE THEIR TAX THE- SHE ALSO FACED WITH A FROM HOGAN AS FORTY REVIEW OVER THE SEVERAL WEEKS INSULARUM AND OF SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IS INEXCUSABLE. IN LIGHT OF MANEUVERS TO HAMPER IN SOME CASES COMPLETELY SILENCE RESEARCH IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST WE BELIEVE IT IS UNSUSTAINABLE TO CONTINUE DOWN A PATH OF SELF REGULATION AND TRANSPARENCY BY CHOICE. RESEARCHERS NEED PROTECTIONS FROM COMPANIES THAT CAN REVOKE ACCESS. AND CAN CHERRY PICK AVAILABLE DATES AT WILL. WE S. INDEPENDENT RESEARCH ISN'T CONCERNED SEVERAL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS MUST BE ABLE TO SEE THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEMWE KNOW WE CONTRAST THE PLATFORMS WE MUST BE ABLE TO TRUST OUTSIDE RESEARCH AND PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF USERS IN THE PROCESS. WELL IT'S NOT REPORTS THAT FACEBOOK FANS YOUR MORE THAN THE UNITED STATES WHEN IT COMES TO REGULATION I ACTUALLY HAVE TWO MEMBERS OF STAFF TODAY GIVING EVIDENCE THE INTERNATIONAL BROWN COMMITTEE ON DISINFORMATION IN BRUSSELS. I GAVE EVIDENCE THIS MORNING TO A FOREIGN OFFICE EVENT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM I WAS THE FIRST WITNESS BEFORE THE ONLINE SAFETY BILL COMMITTEE. MENTIONED BY SAFETY SHANGO YET. YOU IN THE U. K. ALL. AHEAD OF THE U. S. TO THEIR RESPECTIVE DIGITAL SERVICES ACT. ON ONLINE SAFETY BILL INITIATIVES. THE ONLINE SAFETY BILL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO HOLD PLATFORMS TO REDUCE OF CARE. TO PROTECT THAT USES FROM ILLEGAL AND HARMFUL CONTENT. BRING REAL PENALTIES TO PLATFORM TO PROFIT FROM THE PROLIFERATION OF HARMFUL CONTENT IMPACTS TO KEEP WHAT THEY PROFIT THESE OFFICES IS THESE AREN'T THE PUBLIC SQUARE AT. THESE ARE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE MADE UNTOLD AMOUNTS OF MONEY. BY REORDERING INFORMATION TO RIDICULOUS I'M THERE IS A QUANTIFIABLE DEATH TOLL. MY FRIEND PETER HOTEZ TALKS ABOUT HOW THE DELTA. IT TOOK. SUCH A PROFOUNDLY DEADLY WHITE HUNDRED THOUSAND DEBT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE UNCONSCIONABLE DELAYS AND VACCINATION. GENERALLY THE SIX HAVE A DEATH TOLL CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER BRIAN SICKNESS. BUT ALSO YOU KNOW ACTUALLY BOBBITT WHOSE MIND WAS POISONED BY THE LIES FED TO HER RUTHLESSLY BY SOCIAL MEDIA ALGORITHMS. SHE WENT FROM BEING A VETERAN OF THE U. S. MILITARY TO DOMESTIC. TERRORISTS SHOT TO DEATH. NO I WAS OUTAGE GOES IS OF COOL GOES GOES THE- THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO SET THE STANDARD. TO MAKE THE PLATFORM ADULTS ARE VERY RICH USE. TO FINALLY BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TO A COMMITTEES TODAY I SINCERELY HOPE THIS WILL SPARK A REAL CHANGE WAS LEGISLATION FOR TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THANK YOU MR RAHMAN. OUR NEXT LAUREN OF. ROTH THE TECHNOLOGY POLICY AND ADVOCACY COUNCIL AT THE ANTI DEFAMATION LEAGUE. AFTERNOON THANK YOU TARANA BURKE VICE CHAIR GORGEOUS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LORN CROP AND I SERVICE ADL'S TECHNOLOGY POLICY ADVOCACY COUNCIL IT IS MY HONOR TO SPEAK TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY ABOUT HOW SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS CAN TAKE ACTION AND ADDRESS THE HATE AND DISINFORMATION RUNNING RAMPANT ON THEIR PLATFORMS. THE WAY NEWS AND CURRENT EVENTS REVERBERATE ONLINE MATTERS WHAT WAS ONCE ON THE FRINGES OF SOCIETY IS NOW FRONT AND CENTER IN OUR PLATFORM NEWSFEEDS FAULT ALLEGATIONS OF VOTER FRAUD HOSTED AN AMPLIFIED ON SOCIAL MEDIA LED TO THE VIOLENT INSTRUCTION AT OUR NATION'S CAPITAL. THE MOST PREDICTABLE TERROR INCIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY WAS LITERALLY PLANNED AND PROMOTED OUT IN THE OPEN ON SOCIAL MEDIA. UNTIL NOW. IT'S NOT JUST CARDS MEMBERS OF EXTREMIST GROUPS THAT COMMIT ACTS OF VIOLENCE. ACCORDING TO ADL RESEARCH OVER 70% OF THE PEOPLE WO STORMED THE CAPITOL ON JANUARY SIXTH WE'RE NOT SELF IDENTIFIED EXTREMISTS. THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE MOTIVATED FOR A STEADY DIET OF LIES AND MISINFORMATION THAT SOCIAL MEDIA ALGORITHMS PUMPED OUT BECAUSE THIS CONTENT IS HIGHLY ENGAGING. ADL'S CENTER FOR TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY HAS ALSO ENGAGED FROM REPORTING ON CONTENT MANAGEMENT PLATFORMS HOLOCAUST DENIAL POLICIES AND RESPONSE TO ANTI SEMITISM WE PUT OUT REPORT CARDS. THE HELP CONSISTENT PLATFORMS ENFORCE THEIR POLICIES WHEN IT CAME TO ANTI SEMITISM YOU TOO AND WHAT ABOUT THE HIGHEST RATES WITH A B. MINUS. TAKE TALKING FACEBOOK GOT A C. MINUS WHEN IT CAME TO HOLOCAUST DENIAL YOU TO TWITTER AND TAKE TALK ABOUT SEIZE FACEBOOK GADDI. THIS IS ALARMING AND DEEPLY TROUBLING IN ADDITION TO MISINFORMATION AND EXTREMISM AGL HAS BEEN TRACKING THE GROWING THREAT OF ONLINE HARASSMENT ON SOCIAL MEDIA. AS MY COLLEAGUE DAVID JFFREY DISCUSSED EARLIER ACCORDING TO ADL'S LATEST DATA ONE IN THREE AMERICANS WHO ARE HARASSED ONLINE TRIBUTE AT LEAST SOME HARASSMENT TO A PROTECTED CHARACTERISTIC. THIS IS ONLY TAKING PLACE ON DARK WEB MESSAGE BOARDS. 75% OF THOSE HARASSED THAT AT LEAST SOME HARASSMENT HAPPENED ON FACEBOOK 24% ON TWITTER 21% ON YOUTUBE 15% ON SNAPCHAT. WELL RESOURCE HIGHLY PROFITABLE PLATFORMS. MAJOR SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES WILL TELL YOU THAT IT'S TOO HARD TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THAT THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK WILL PREVENT US FROM REGULATING THEIR PLATFORMS IT'S SIMPLY RIDICULOUS. AUTOMOBILES. FOOD XIN DRUGS AND SECURE A- HI MY TIME AGAIN LAMI HAVE CRAFTED GOOD. TO AND INTO ALIKE THERE'S A LOT WE CAN AND MUST. TO PUSH HATE EXTREME. BACK TO THE FRINGES OF THE DIGITAL WORLD AND REPAIRING OUR INTERNET STARTS WITH TRANSPARENCY. TRANSPARENCY IS ABOUT SHINING THE LIGHT ON SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES CONTENT MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES. IT IS ABOUT GETTING ACCESS TO CONSISTENT AND REGULAR DATA TO ENSURE THAT BIG SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ARE TAKING THE NECESSARY STEPS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. MUCH LIKE THE IMPORTANCE OF TRACKING AND DOCUMENTING HE CRIMES TRACKING DISINFORMATION EXTREMISM HATE HARASSMENT AND FOR INTERFERENCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS FOR TRANSPARENCY REPORTS WILL PROVIDE CRITICAL DATA THAT CAN BE USED TO INFORM POLICY. AND PROTECT TARGETED GROUPS. PARENTS REFORM MOTOR PLATFORMS TO BE MORE EXPLICIT ABOUT THEIR POLICIES ON HATE HARASSMENT AND MISINFORMATION AND APPLY THE RULES CONSISTENTLY. IT WOULD ACT AS A DETERRENT FOR MAKING CHANGES EXCEPTIONS AND OTHER DECISIONS THAT END UP AMPLIFYING HEAT. IT WOULD CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES CAN COMPETE ON HOW WELL THEY ARE PROTECTING USERS NOT ON HOW THEY CAN OPTIMIZE THE MOST CORROSIVE CONTENT TO KEEP US ROLLING FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE TO SELL AS MANY EYES AS POSSIBLE. TODAY MOST MAJOR SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES ONLY PUBLISH LIMITED INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR CONTENT POLICIES AND ENFORCEMENT. EFFORTS BY THESE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN OPAQUE ARBITRARY BIASED AND INEQUITABLE WHY IS THIS THE CASE. CURRENTLY SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES HAVE LITTLE TO NO LEGAL OR FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO GIVE CONSUMERS COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION THEIR REPORTS AND OF SERVING AS A DEFLECTION AWAY FROM THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT CONTENT PROLIFERATES ON PLATFORMS. RECENT REVELATIONS FROM LEAKED DOCUMENTS SHOW THAT THIS ISN'T JUST A THEORY ORGANIZATIONS LIKE FACEBOOK HAD AN UNANNOUNCED PROGRAM CALLED CROSSCHECK THAT ALLOWED OVER FIVE MILLION CELEBRITIES POLITICIANS AND INFLUENCERS TO EFFECTIVELY SCORED ALL OF THE PUBLISHED RULES AND POLICIES. THAT MEANT THAT NONE OF THE POSTS BY MILLIONS OF PUBLIC FIGURES WONDER AUTOMATED SYSTEMS NORMALLY FLAG BY LEADING CONTACT. THE MOST INFLUENTIAL ACCOUNTS GOT A FREE PASS FOR POSTING ALMOST ANYTHING THEY WANTED WHENEVER THEY WANTED. WE ONLY KNEW ABOUT THIS BECAUSE OF A WHISTLEBLOWER NONE OF THIS WAS DISCLOSED IN A SINGLE PLATFORM REPORT. WHAT OTHER BAD BEHAVIORS WHAT THEY THOUGHT IF THEY KNEW THEY HAD TO REPORT ON THEIR POLICIES AND ENFORCEMENT CONSISTENTLY. THERE ARE CLEAR ISSUES WITH THE WAY PLATFORMS CRRENTLY SHARE THE LIMITED INFORMATION THEY DO PUBLISH. FIRST THE INFORMATION PLATFORMS TO SHARE IS MISSING CRUCIAL. CONTACTS FOR EXAMPLE BASICALLY THAT LAW SCORE IT THIRTY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION PIECES OF CON. BUT DOT UNCOVERED BY WAS FOR HOW CAN SHOW THAT THE COMPANY TO ACTION ON AS LITTLE AS THREE TO FIVE PER. OF ALL HE CON ON PLATFORM. THAT MEANS BASICALLY MISSED OVER A BILLION PIECES OF HATE CONTACT. HOW CAN WE RECONCILE THESE NUMBERS IT'S BASICALLY INTENTIONALLY DECEPTIVE IN THEIR REPORTING WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS NUMERATORS WITHOUT DENOMINATORS. SECOND PLATFORMS ARE CHERRY PICKING INFORMATION THEY SHARE RESULTING IN AN INABILITY TO MEANINGFULLY COMPARE PLATFORMS AND HOW THEY'RE RESPONDING TO HATE EXTREMISM AND MISINFORMATION. THIRD INFORMATION IS HARD TO FIND MANY BIG SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HAVE ESTABLISHED MICROSITES SOMETIMES KNOWN AS TRANSPARENCY SANDERS HOWEVER TRANSPARENCY CENTERS ARE INACCESSIBLE AND NOT USER FRIENDLY. A FEW EXAMPLES WELL MISTER HOFFMAN MAY HAVE SHOWN THE MOST UP TO DATE BASIC REPORT IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND AND COMPARE PAST. IF SOMEONE DOWNLOADS TWITTER'S REPORT THE EIGHT PAGE PDF ONLY SHOWS HOW THE TEXT OF THE PAGE AND HALF. OF THE TAX IS BLANK. WHERE SHOULD NOT TO SO MUCH TIME OR AND- SEARCHING FOR A- THAT SHOULD BE READILY ACCESSIBLE. TODAY WE ARE IN THE DARK THESE TRANSPARENT YOUR SUPPORT REPORTS ARE EXERCISES IN OBSERVATION. CONSISTENT AND COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPARENCY WILL FINALLY CLARIFY PLATFORM POLICIES AND REPEAL DATA REGARDING ENFORCEMENT OF THOSE POLICIES WILL UNDERSTAND RULES CHANGES TO RULES EXCEPTIONS TO RULES AND CATEGORIES OF VIOLATIONS WE WILL ALSO GET HIGH QUALITY DATA. NOT JUST PUBLISHING NUMBERS BUT EXPLAINING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THOSE NUMBERS. PARENTS HE IS. SAT TO CREATING A SAFER AND MORE EQUITABLE INTERNET TO BE CLEAR TRANSPARENCY IS NOT FORCING COMPANIES TO REVEAL TRADE SECRETS IT'S NOT ABOUT REQUIRING COMPANIES HAVE SPECIFIC GUIDELINES IT IS NOT ABOUT RESTRICTING PLATFORMS EDITORIAL DECISIONS OR SUPPRESSING FREE SPEECH. IT IS NOT ABOUT REFORMING SECTION TWO THIRTY TRANSPARENCY IS ABOUT COMPANIES BEING HONEST WITH CONSUMERS ABOUT THE RULES OF THE ROAD AND HOW THEY ENFORCE THOSE RULES. ADDITIONALLY TRANSPARENCY REPORTS ARE NOT OVERLY BURDENSOME OR EXPENSIVE ESPECIALLY FOR SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES THAT MAKE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS BILLIONS OR TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN GROSS REVENUE. CURRENTLY MOST SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ALREADY TRACK MUCH OF THE INFORMATION YOU'RE SEEKING REFORM TRANSPARENCY THE RELATIVELY SMALL QUARTERLY COST OF COMPLIANCE WOULD BE OFFSET BY THE ENORMOUS BENEFIT TO PUBLIC SAFETY. FINALLY INFLATED CLAIMS THAT BAD ACTORS AND EXTREMISTS WOULD SOMEHOW TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IF THEY WERE MORE TRANSPARENT IS A STRONG ARGUMENT. BAD ACTORS AND EXTREMISTS ARE ALREADY EXPLOITING SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM CAPABILITIES ANONYMIZED AGGREGATED DATA ABOUT CONTENT MODERATION WOULD MAKE THIS WORSE RATHER IT WOULD GIVE US TOOLS AND TOOLS TO RESEARCHERS CIVIL SOCIETY AND POLICY. MAKERS TO COUNTER THE THREAT. TRANSPARENCY IS NOT NEW WE WERE FOR THAT TO THEIR SHARE IN THE MARKET. WE REQUIRE FOR COMPANIES THAT SELL FOOD AND COSMETICS WE SHOULD DEMAND THE SAME FOR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS THAT HAVE THE POWER TO SHAPE THE WAY WE DIGEST INFORMATION. UNTRACKED HE FULL AN EXTREMIST CONTENT PUSHES WOMEN PEOPLE OF COLOR LGBTQ PLUS PEOPLE AND OTHER MARGINALIZED GROUPS OUT OF ONLINE SPACES IT HAS FRACTURED OUR DEMOCRACY AND SPREAD HEALTH MISINFORMATION. WE KNOW THESE HARMS EXIST BUT WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF THEM WHAT WE DO NOW IS THAT THE PROBLEM IS TOO SEVERE AND THE CONSEQUENCES ARE TOO GREAT. TRANSPARENCY REGULATION REFORM IS THE NECESSARY AND IMPORTANT STAR TREK HEARING OUR INTERNET THANK YOU. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU OUR NEXT LOVE PROFESSOR MACKINNON IF PROFESSOR MACKINNON- VISITING PROFESSOR OF LAW AT HARVARD LAW IN AT MICHIGAN LAW IF BOB IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE IF YOU COULD MAKE YOURSELF KNOWN. AND IF NOT- WE COULDN'T COME BACK TO THE PANEL FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AND THEN SEE IF PROFESSOR MACKINNON HAS JOINED US- QUESTIONS COMMENTS. YES CENTER CORTESE. WITH EARTH- THANK YOU TO REMEMBER- HE HAS FOR THE LAST THE LAST PRESENTER- THIS CRAP JUST ON THE TRANSPARENCY ISSUE- IN THE PLEASE I HOPE THIS QUESTION COMES ACROSS THIS- IT'S NOT A SORT OF A PARTISAN QUESTION TERMS OF TAKING SIDES ON ON THE ISSUE I AM INTERESTED IN INTERESTED IN HEARING MORE. AS TO- WHERE YOU DRAW THE LINE IN TERMS OF. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU. HE WOULD HE WOULD WANT TO PROTECT FROM A PROPRIETARY THE SECURITY STANDPOINT- SO THE PEOPLE CAN'T MANIPULATE TAKE WHAT THEY'VE LEARNED FROM THE TRANSPARENCY AND MANIPULATED- UNIVERSES. ASSEMBLY THERE IS A CONCERN WHICH I THINK YOU KNOW ARE ARE CLEAR AND OBVIOUS AND YOU DID A GREAT JOB OF RECITING IN TERMS OF- EXTREMIST BEHAVIOR I THINK IT KIND OF GOES BACK TO SOME OF THE EARLIER QUESTIONS. ON A PER PANEL THAT SOME OF US WERE ASKING ABOUT. I'M FIGHTING WORDS OR WORDS THAT WOULD INCITE RIOTS- YOU KNOW CLEARLY. A TRANSPARENCY- AROUND THOSE KIND OF ISSUES- WHEN- PERHAPS IT'S NOT THE PLATFORM OF. SORT OF PERPETRATING- THE THAT THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE OF THOSE KIND OF CONCERNS- WILL BECOME CONCERNS IT'S ITS THIRD PARTY USERS- I COULD I COULD SEE TRANSPARENCY THAT. THAT HELPS US NO OR OR UNDERSTAND WHERE THAT CONTENT IS COMING FROM- THAT KIND OF TRANSPARENCY- JUST LIKE A HAD A NEWSPAPER WOULD WANT TO KNOW WHEN SOMEONE WRITES A LETTER TO THE EDITOR- IS A COMMON PRACTICE ALL WAS ELECTED OFFICIALS I THINK KNOWS YOU'LL GET A AN EMAIL BACK SAYING WE NEED TO VERIFY THIS IS REALLY YOU- IN THIS SORT OF A FORM OF TRANSPARENCY- BUT BUT WHERE DO YOU DRAW THAT LINE AND I GUESS WHAT I'M REALLY ASKING IF I MISSED IT I APOLOGIZE. IS THERE A BODY OF WORK THE YOU CAN INVOLVED WITH THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF THAT BEGINS TO- SORT OF THRUST THAT OUT. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR REGARDING WHERE WE DRAW THE LINE IT'S ACTUALLY PLATFORMS THAT ARE DRAWING THESE LINES BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE SEEKING WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSPARENCY IS INFORMATION ABOUT THE POLICIES THAT ARE PUT OUT BY PLATFORMS CLEARLY TO THOSE POLICIES HOW THEY'RE ENFORCED WHAT CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE WHAT EXCEPTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE AND THEN REGARDING DATA AND METRICS WHAT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL IS AGGREGATED ANONYMIZED DATA. REGARDING THE ENFORCEMENT OF THESE POLICIES HOW HAS IT CHANGED OVER TIME CAN WE COMPARE QUARTER TO QUARTER SO I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY GET AROUND THAT BECAUSE WHEN WE SEE MORE INFORMATION REGARDING PLATFORM POLICIES AND ENFORCEMENT THEY ARE CREATING THE RULES AND GUIDELINES THAT THEY WANT TO HAVE ON THEIR PLATFORMS WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW IS WHAT ARE THESE EXACT RULES AND GUIDELINES HOW HAVE THEY CHANGED OVER TIME. WHAT ARE THE EXCEPTIONS AND WHAT IS THE ANONYMIZED AND AGGREGATED DATA TO HELP US SEE WHETHER OR NOT THESE POLICIES ARE BEING FORCED EQUITABLY AND AT SCALE. IF I CAN JUST BUY OF PROBLEM A PRETTY ANALOGY- IN APOLOGIZE FOR THAT BUT- IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WORK BY BY STATE LAW THERE'S A THING CALLED THE BROWN ACT WHICH- IS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY IT'S ABOUT- TRANSPARENCY THE PUBLIC IN TERMS OF THE BUSINESS OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT YOU HAVE TO DO IT. OPENLY BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN- EXCLUSIONS TO THAT. IN AND ONE OF THEM- IT IS. WOULD YOU HAVE HER THREATS- WHEN YOU HAVE. TERRORIST ACTIVITY THOSE KINDS OF THINGS IT'S NOT THAT. IT'S NOT THAT THE ENTITIES INVOLVED DON'T WANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT. BUT THERE'S SORT OF A- A LIMITED VERSION OF TRANSPARENCY WORD THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS ALLOWED TO TAKE. THAT CONTENT BUT TAKE THAT ISSUE I'M SORRY TAKE THE ISSUE INTO A- INTO A MORE CLOISTERED. THE LESS SAID. PRESIDENTIALLY A NON PUBLIC ENVIRONMENT AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE ELECTED OFFICIALS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS- AND- THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING THE PUBLIC CAN STILL. GET THAT INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED AND GET IT ON THE TABLE AND FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S SOME ACTION OBVIOUS REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO TELEGRAPH. TO THE VERY PERPETRATORS- WHAT YOUR NEXT. PLAN IS GOING TO BE- WE RESPONSE IS GOING TO BE AN OPEN PUBLIC ENVIRONMENT. AND SO. I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S BEEN THOUGHT IT YOU KNOW FROM. FROM FROM YOUR SIDE OF THINGS- THE LEAGUE- YOU KNOW OTHER ALLIES SO TO SPEAK ABOUT SOME SORT OF A HYBRID. APPROACH WHERE- YOU KNOW IT'S THAT KIND OF INFORMATION IS NOT OFF LIMITS BUT IT'S SERVER QUEUES FROM THE PUBLIC UNTIL. APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENTAL. OVERSIGHT COULD CAN COME IN IN A MORE CONFIDENTIAL MANNER AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON. ABSOLUTELY I THINK WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HERE IS TO KNOW THAT WELL TRANSPARENCY ISN'T EASY IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE SOMETHING'S ACTUALLY CAN AND SHOULD BE DISCLOSED TO THE PUBLIC AT LARGE LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE WHAT ARE THE POLICIES HOW ARE HEY BEING ENFORCED GIVE US SOME ANONYMIZED AND AGGREGATED DATA TO BETTER ENFORCEMENT. AND AS YOU MENTIONED THERE MIGHT BE OTHER TYPES OF TRANSPARENCY METHODS AND MECHANISMS THAT MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE WE CAN ABSOLUTELY GET THIS DONE WE CAN LOOK THROUGH ADL HAS WORKED EXTENSIVELY ON IT AND WE'VE OUTLINED WHAT WE THINK IS NECESSARY FOR TRANSPARENCY FROM A PUBLIC VETTING. AND WE ABSOLUTELY CAN AND SHOULD WORK TO GET MORE INFORMATION FROM PLATFORM FOR RESEARCHERS AND ACADEMICS SO WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM AND EXCO I THINK IT'S A BOTH. ENDS NOT AN EITHER OR- THANK YOU FOR. TO PREVIEW THE SHALL. THANK YOU. SIR STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I'M I'M CURIOUS TO GET A SENSE FROM- THE REPRESENTED FOR THE INTERNET ASSOCIATION MR HOFFMAN- THE SOME OF THE- RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE INTEGRITY INSTITUTE FROM DOCTOR ALLEN- IN TERMS OF THE TYPES OF. OF INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE USEFUL TO BE- REPORTED- TRANSPARENTLY OR WITH RESEARCHERS AS WELL AS- OUR LAST PANELISTS FROM EIGHTY L. IT DOES THAT JIBE WITH WHAT THE COMPANIES ARE CURRENTLY DOING WHERE WHERE DO YOU SEE THE DISPARITY IN IS THERE ANY- OF VERSION TO THE KIND OF DISCLOSURE THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. NO I THINK OUT OF BASE LEVEL YOU KNOW WE'RE OPEN TO IMPROVING TRANSPARENCY I THINK AN IMPROVING OUR METRICS WELL BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE THE METRICS ARE IMPORTANT SO THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT- WHAT WE'RE DOING TO ENFORCE OUR STANDARDS AND SO- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY DOCTOR ALLEN IS THIS FAR MORE OF THE- THE DATA ASPECT AND I AM AS FAR AS- HOW TO COLLECT THOSE AND SO I FOUND THIS PRESENTATION VERY INTERESTING THAT'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE THAT ARE COMPANIES ARE ARE TALKING ABOUT INTERNALLY- I CAN'T SPEAK TO HER TO THOSE INTERNAL CONVERSATION BUT I CAN'T SAY GENERALLY WE ARE CONSIDERING A LOT OF WAYS AS A INDUSTRY- TO IMPROVE THOSE SO. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE IN THAT INFORMATION AND TRYTO EVALUATE- WHERE AND HOW WE CAN- IMPROVE ZONES- YOU KNOW DATA FLOWS FOR PUBLIC INFORMATION. THANKS FOR- YOU KNOW I'M I'M- I'M I'M WRESTLING WITH THIS SORT OF RESEARCH CONTEXT WHICH SOUNDS SO INNOCUOUS AND YET- WHAT WE SAW HAPPEN TO THE IN THE CASE OF AN WHY YOU AND THE IS IT CALLED AD TRACKER. I'M CURIOUS ABOUT WHETHER ADAM FOR MANY OF OUR ACADEMICS HERE OR RESEARCHERS HAVE YOU ALL- DID YOU FOLLOW THINK THERE ARE OTHER- INSTANCES WHERE. THIS KIND OF SORT OF PUBLICLY INTERESTED ACADEMIC RESEARCH IS BEING- QUASHED OR OTHERWISE DENIED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF PRIVACY CONCERNS. I'LL JUST QUICKLY MENTION SENATOR THAT- THE CASE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT- INVOLVES ONE EDL SULFUR FELLOWS LARA ADOLESCENT WHO WAS REVOKED pMORE RESEARCH TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ADVERTISING ADVERTISING ECOSYSTEM ON FACEBOOK AND HOW THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE IMPACTED THINGS LIKE THE INSURRECTION AND YES IT'S INCREDIBLY CONCERNING ACCESS TO RESEARCHERS. FOR SPECIFIC TYPES OF DATA IS BEING REVOKED. SOMETIMES ANY WARNING AND CERTAINLY WITHOUT ANY SPECIFIC- JUSTIFICATION ESPECIALLY WHEN THE JUSTIFICATION WAS THAT THERE WERE SOME SORT OF FTC BREACH OF THE ACT YOU SEE CAME OUT AND SAID THAT'S NOT THE CASE. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE NEED MORE ACCESS TO RESEARCHERS AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT IT'S CONSISTENT AND NOT BEING REVOKED WITHOUT ANY WARNING. DOCTOR ALLEN ANY ANY- ANY SENSE ON THE IF YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS WERE UNDERTAKEN WITHOUT A CHANGE IN. SAY STATE OR FEDERAL LAW- DO YOU SEE THE PRIVATE SECTOR UNDERTAKING. AS THESE KINDS OF MEASURES. WILL FULLY OR DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE THE FORCE OF LAW OR SOME OTHER KIND OF PUBLIC FRAMEWORK TO. TO BRING. I GUESS INTEGRITY FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD. YEAH I THINK- WE DEFINITELY SEE PLATFORMS TAKING STEPS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION- YOU KNOW CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE RIGHT LIKETHE MAJOR PLATFORMS HAVE- BEEN PROACTIVE IN IN DISCLOSING BOTH DATA SETS AND NUMBERS- I THINK WE NEED A LOT MORE I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE TO BE DONE- AND SO I GUESS LIKE WE WILL SEE IF WE ARE ABLE TO GET- COMPREHENSIVE TRANSPARENCY. ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS I'M I DO THINK THATYOU KNOW ONE THING TO CONSIDER IS THAT WE ARE NOT. WE HAVE NOT SEEN EVERY SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM THAT WE WILL EVER SEE RIGHT- TECH TALK IS THAT IS NOT THE LAST PLATFORM THEY'LL EVER SORT OF LIKE REACH A BILLION USERS- WE SHOULD EXPECT NEW PLATFORMS TO COME UP IN THE FUTURE- AND WE SHOULD NOT ALWAYS NECESSARILY EXPECT THEM. TO PROACTIVELY FOLLOW THESE ARE LIKE BEST PRACTICES. IN SERVICE RIGHT I THINK I SAW PROFESSOR. RAISING HER HAND TO RESPOND TO YOUR QUESTION. SO PROFESSOR CLINIC WE WERE YOU RAISING YOUR HAND OR- OR JUST SAYING HELLO. NO I WAS RAISING MY HAND I WAS GOING TO SPEAK TO THE LAUREL AT LORETTA'S WILL SIMPLY BREAK- THIS CRAFT WAS. PERFECT IN HER RESPONSE AND SUMMED UP ALL OF THE SAME POINTS THAT WAS GOING TO MAKE. ALREADY THEIR- SINISTER GO HEAD TO PUT THANK YOU MR. I DIDN'T KNOW- IF MISCONDUCT I KNOW YOU ARE OUT IN NEW YORK OR THEREABOUTS- ARE THERE OTHER CASES BEYOND THE NYU RESEARCH THAT. ARE OF CONCERN TO YOU I MEAN. YOUR YOU KNOW YOU'RE IT YOU'RE A LAW SCHOOL YOU'RE DOING- INFORMATION ANALYSIS. ARE THERE ANY OTHER EFFORTS- SORT OF RECTIFY. OR IS IT IS IT'S CURRENTLY JUST THE. THE LITIGATION THAT'S UNDER WAY FROM THE N. Y. U. AGAIN. FOR THAT SORT OF AN ADDICT. YU THINK HOW THIS WHOLE. LANDSCAPE OCCURS I AM IS THERE A BIG BURDEN THEN TAKE THEM ON- YOU KNOW WITHOUT SERIOUS LEGAL COUNSEL BUT- YEAH I'M JUST CURIOUS YOUR PERSPECTIVE THERE. YEAH OF COURSE AND REALLY QUICKLY I KNOW IT'S A REALLY SMALL POINT BUT I JUST WANTED TO SAY AS MUCH AS CALIFORNIA WANTS TO THANK THAT BUT- HERE'S THE- AS CAL. GOES GOES THE NATION THAT ACTUALLY THE PHRASE MEETING FORTY AND IT'S ASKING GOES SO GOES THE NATION SO LIKE I JUST. THANKS PANEL ABOUT MISSING PER. JUST GOT EXTENT BETTER OUT THERE- ANYWAY. I BE. THE POINT THAT I WAS GOING TO MAKE IT YES THERE ARE KINDS THAT THERE LOTS OF DIFFERENT. THAT THE COMPANY ARE ENGAGING WITH RESEARCHERS AND SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCHERS- I'M LETTING ME INSIDE FACEBOOK WITHOUT AN NDA. AND ALLOW ME TO TAKE CONVERSATIONS- A VERY- UNUSUAL STEP FOR THE COMPANY OF STEAK AND HADN'T DONE NOT WITH PRETTY MUCH ANYONE BEFORE AND- AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S DONE SO CENTS THERE'S A FEW REPORTERS I THINK WHO HAVE LIMITED NDAS OR SOME TYPE OF THING BUT THERE IS. THAT WAS A BIG STEP AND THE MAIN REASON THAT THEY LET ME DO THAT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A HUGE TRANSPARENCY INITIATIVE AND SO IS GOING TO LOOK A LITTLE BIT. SKETCHY IF THEY WANTED SOMEONE TO COME IN AND BRING TRANSPARENCY AND THEN. LIKE SADDLE THEM WITH AN NDA BUT MORE OF THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE KIND OF ANTHROPOLOGISTS LIKE KIND AND SOCIAL SCIENTISTS GOING IN AND TALKING TO THE COMPANIES THAT SEEING WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE INSIDE AND BRINGING US OUT. I DIDN'T JUST OBSERVE OF COURSE LIKE OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR INSIDE FACEBOOK ON AND OFF. JUST FACEBOOK- AND THAT ONE TEAM I DEVELOP SOURCES I MET PEOPLE I LIKE DEVELOP PEOPLE WHO. CONTINUE TO TELL ME THINGS TODAY- THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT I FIND FROM BY IT BUT- LAND CREDENCE TO EVERYTHING REFERENCES HOW GOING TO- COME OUT AND SAID- AND I THINK THAT THOSE TYPES OF RELATIONSHIPS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. BETWEEN KIND OF ACADEMICS AND SCHOLARSHIP ALWAYS THAT AND JOURNALISTS TO VOICE SUDDENLY KIND OF THE EDGE OF GATEKEEPING BETWEEN THAT LEGISLATIVE LEGISLATORS AND- AND THE FIRMS SO JUST TO YOUR POINT ABOUT- LARA ADOLESCENTS WHICH IS. THAT KAIST. FACEBOOK'S BEEN IT LIKE DISTRICT OF JUST GIVES A LITTLE BIT OF CLARITY OF LIKE WHY WOULD FACE. DO SO LIKE THAT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THEY DID SOME LIKE THIS IS BECAUSE- THE TYPE OF RESEARCH. THAT EDELSON WAS ENGAGED IN WAS BASICALLY USING A PLUGIN OR API TO. GREAT PERSONALLY. INFORMATION CONCEIVABLY FROM FACEBOOK- SO THAT THEY COULD USE THAT THEY WOULD REMOVE THE K. I. IF THE PERCENT OF VIOLENT. PATIENT AND THEN THEY WOULD TRY TO LIKE USE THAT AND THE REASON THAT THEY'RE DOING THAT. IS BECAUSE THERE IS. A FAILURE OF THE COMPANY IS TO PROVIDE THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION. ON THEIR OWN AND THERE IS A LACK OF TRUST. BETWEEN WHAT THE COMPANIES WILL PROVIDE RESEARCHERS VERSUS WHAT THEY THINK THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET ON THEIR OWN AND I WILL SAY THAT I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE BOTH. YOU HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE LIKE LAUREL SAID OUT THERE SCRAPING AND SEEING WHAT'S GOING ON PEOPLE ACTUAL SPEEDS AND YOU HAVE TO CHECK THAT AGAINST WHAT THE COMPANIES ARE PROVIDING. THAT IS WHAT LIKE LITERALLY THE DEFINITION OF ACCOUNTABILITY THAT COME THROUGH TWO PHASES OF TRANSPARENCY- I JUST WILL SAY REALLY QUICKLY TO YOUR POINT ABOUT TRANSPARENCY. THIS IS. A WORD THAT GETS BANDIED ABOUT IS THIS MAGIC BULLET IT IS SO COMPLICATED AND IT CHANGES MEANING ACROSS DIFFERENT CONTEXTS AND DEFERRED BALANCES- WE DO NOT EXPECT FOR EXAMPLE. THE SUPREME COURT TO TELL US EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN CHAMBERS OR IN DARK CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THEM. THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT THAT WE ARE ALLOW PEOPLE TO LIKE HAVE THE PRIVACY OF THEIR IDEAS AND LIKE. AND HOW THEY MAKE DECISIONS. BUT HAVING A REAL ACTS. IN A AT THE END OF THE DAY. AND SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE PUT THEIR NAME. AND REFERENCE. AND LIKE ENTIRE STATURE OF THEIR OFFICE BEHIND IS WHY WE MIGHT PUT FAITH IN THE LAW. AND THAT SYSTEM WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING CLOSE TO THAT RIGHT NOW. AND YET. THESE COMPANIES ARE GOVERNING US IN THIS WAY OVER A HAVING EVEN THOUGH THEIR PRIVATE COMPANIES I WILL SAY THEY'RE MORE LIKE A PUBLIC SQUARE. THAN ANYTHING ELSE- AND THEY ARE DOING THAT KIND OF FROM A PRIVATE PERSPECTIVE WITHOUT WITH LIMITED REPORTS FOR SOME OF THE THINGS I DO THINK THEY'VE TRIED TO GET THERE IN VARIOUS WAYS AND- SOMETIMES THEY'VE- DONE WELL AND SOMETIMES THEY HAVEN'T. AND THIS JUST NEEDS TO KEEP THIS CONVERSATION JUST NEED TO KEEP HAPPENING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU JUST A BIT OF HOUSEKEEPING WE'RE GONNA TURN TO PROFESSOR MACKINNON IN JUST A MOMENT. OF FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO'VE BEEN WAITING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT- NOW'S A GOOD TIME TO QUEUE UP IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY QUEUED UP I'LL GIVE YOU THE NUMBERS ONE MORE TIME. THE PARTICIPANT NUMBERS EIGHT FOUR FOUR. EIGHT SIX SEVEN SIX ONE SIX THREE THE ACCESS CODE IS SEVEN THREE FOUR. SEVEN EIGHT TWO FOUR. WHEN YOU. ARE IN OUR QUEUED UP TO. PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT IT WILL JUST SIMPLY BE PUBLIC COMMENT THATTHE PANEL WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE TO RESPOND TO YOUR QUESTIONS ALL RIGHT. SO LET'S TURN TO PROFESSOR MACKINNON THANK YOU FOR JOINING US HERE TODAY THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU SO MUCH- ARE YOU ABLE TO HEAR ME. WE CAN HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR THANK YOU SO BEAUTIFUL THANK YOU BUT CHAIRED SENATOR UMBERG OF FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE PART OF THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION AND- ALSO- SENATOR CABALLERO- IF SHE IS STILL THERE THANK YOU AS WELL- AND ENERGY TO BE. TESTIFYING AT AT YOUR HEARING AS JUST ONE PART OF THE RANGE OF ISSUES THAT ARE CONFRONTED HERE IN THIS. REALLY CRUCIAL A CRITICAL CONVERSATION- I'M GOING TO BE DISCUSSING SENATOR CORTEZ IS TIMELY BILL S. B. FOUR THIRTY FIVE. OF WHICH RESPONSE TO A PROBLEM THAT HAS EXISTED FOR A REALLY LONG TIME- IT HAS NEVER BEEN ADEQUATELY LEGALLY ADDRESS DESPITE. SOME WELL INTENTIONED EFFORTS AND HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE HARMFUL TO THOSE VICTIMIZED BY IT AS THE TECHNOLOGY THAT YOU ALL HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING WITH SUCH DEPTH AND NUANCE AND SCOPE OF INFORMATION TODAY- LEAVING IN. ISNS OF WHICH THIS BILL WOULD BEGIN TO BRING INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY- AS YOU ALL PROBABLY KNOW A SENATOR COLORED TENNESSEE'S BILL. ADDRESSES OR CREATES A CIVIL CAUSE OF ACTION FOR ANYONE WHO IS SEX TRAFFICKED ONLINE. US THROUGH NAKED OR SEXUAL PHOTOGRAPHS OF THEM. THAT ARE COERCED TRICKED OR STOLEN. FROM THEM OR MADE OR DISTRIBUTED WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE OR THEIR EXPRESSED FREELY GIVEN PERMISSION NOW THESE MATERIALS OF COURSE ARE JUST ONE SEGMENT OF THE INDUSTRY THAT YOU'RE LOOKING INTO. IT'S A LARGE SUAVE OF THE INTERNET- BUT ACTUALLY- ONLY ONE LIMITED SECTOR OF THE HARMS- THAT YOU'VE BEEN SO CAREFULLY INTERROGATING- THIS BILL IS SITUATED IN THE LEGALLY ESTABLISHED CONTEXT OF FEDERAL ANTI TRAFFICKING LAW WHICH PROHIBITS COMMERCIAL SEX ADDICTS THROUGH FORCE FRAUD OR COERCION AND ADVERTISING THOSE AT THIS BILLS PARTICULAR CONTRIBUTION ALSO INCLUDES A STRONG NOTICE REQUIREMENT- WHICH IS. LAKE CALIFORNIA'S LIBEL LAW IN PERMITTING IMMEDIATE CORRECTION WITHOUT THE PAYMENT OF DAMAGES AND IT ALSO PERMITS STATUTORY DAMAGES ALONG WITH OTHER FORMS OF RELIEF SUCH AS INJUNCTIONS BUT ONLY IF THIS NOTICE IS IGNORED AND THE INJURY CONTINUES- WHEN PEOPLE ARE BEING SEX TRAFFICKED ONLINE AGAINST THEIR WILL. IT IS AS JOURNALISTS HAVE RECENTLY DOCUMENTED A TYPICAL FOR DISTRIBUTORS OF ABDUCTED SEXUAL MATERIALS THESE DAYS TO IGNORE THEIR PLEAS FOR TAKING THEM DOWN DESPITE THE FACT THAT SOME OF THESE LATFORMS SAY OTHERWISE- THIS GOES ON FOR WEEKS EVEN YEARS OF IT AND IT'S ALSO FAIRLY TYPICAL OF THEM- TO REGARD FINES OR DAMAGE AWARDS. ABOUT WHICH ARE INFORMATION IS LIMITED- TO. A CENTRALLY A COST OF DOING BUSINESS. AND TYPICALLY THE DAMAGE AWARDS HAVE BEEN LIMITED TO THOSE WHO ARE VIOLATED IN THESE WAYS WHO ARE UNDER AGE EIGHTEEN WHO ARE A CRUCIAL SEGMENT OF THE PEOPLE HARMED HERE BUT ARE ONLY ONE PART OF THEM. SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE IS THAT THE PURVEYORS OF THESE MATERIALS. OUR CONTINUE TO PROFIT FROM STOLEN INTIMATE INVASIONS AND VIOLATIONS SO THIS PROPOSED LAW COULD BRING AN END TO THAT. IT GOES BEYOND EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW TO MENTION JUST A FEW WAYS IN WHICH IT DOES THAT- IN NOT BEING LIMITED TO CIVIL OBSCENITY MATERIALS AS THE EXISTING HUMAN TRAFFICKING LAW FOR ADULTS IS IN CALIFORNIA. ARE THE OBSCENITY DEFINITION IT'S HARM. THAT IS THE IDEA OF HARM IS NOT PART OF OBSCENITY LAW- THE HARM USED TO MAKE THE MATERIALS FOR EXAMPLE. ARE IS COMPLETELY IRELEVANT TO ITS LEGAL DEFINITION AND ALSO IT'S WELL KNOWN THAT IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE OBSCENITY. OF SENATOR CORTEZ IS LAW IS ALSO NOT VOIDED IF THE MATERIALS WERE MADE IN A PUBLIC PLACE AS QUITE A LOT. OF THESE MATERIALS ARE ALTHOUGH BY NO MEANS ALL AND IT ALSO IS A VOIDED IF THE MATERIALS WERE EVER SENT BEFORE BY ANYONE- AS THE REVENGE PORN LAW IN CALIFORNIA IS LIMITED. AND HIS BILL COVERS THOSE WHO ACTUALLY HAD THE SEX IN THE PHOTOGRAPHS UNLIKE THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA DEEP FAKE LAW WHICH ONLY COVERS. THE PEOPLE IN THOSE MATERIALS WHO DIDN'T- AND THIS LAW PARTICULARLY WITH ITS STRONG NOTICE REQUIREMENT. WHAT MAKES THE JOB OF SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORKS AND PLATFORMS EASIER WHO SAY THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO BE SELLING THE MATERIALS MATERIALS THAT ARE COERCED OR STOLEN. OR TAKEN AWAY FROM PEOPLE WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE OR PERMISSION OF THE MATERIALS MADE ACTIONABLE BY S. B. FOR THIRTY FIVE. IT WOULD ASSIST THEM IN IDENTIFYING THOSE MATERIALS- AT THIS POINT THEY HIRE THEY SAY A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TO ATTEMPT TO CREATE THESE IDENTIFICATIONS WILL THIS BILL WOULD HELP THEM. A LOT IN THAT RESPECT. IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT HAS NEVER PROTECTED COERCED STOLEN SEXUAL MATERIALS OR THOSE OF MADE OR DISTRIBUTED WITHOUT ANY PERMISSION OF THOSE USED TO MAKE THEM. THERE IS NO MOUSETRAP HERE- WHERE MEDIA PLATFORMS ARE WORRIED ABOUT BECOMING LIABLE FOR MATERIALS THEY COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE KNOWN- WERE EITHER OF WHICH IS- PREVENTING WHICH WAS THE MAIN GOAL OF FEDERAL SECTION TWO THIRTY- HERE NOTHING CAN HAPPEN A WITHOUT NOTICE AND- IT'S ONLY WHEN THAT NOTICE IS IGNORED- THAT THE STATUTORY DAMAGES START TO ATTACH. AND ANY LIABILITY CAN TAKE PLACE- IT'S ALSO AGAIN WORTH NOTICING IS THAT CHILD **** WHICH- IS ARE PROHIBITED UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW AND ALSO FEDERAL LAW IS ASSUMED TO BE COERCED OR MANIPULATED OR STOLEN AND- HARMFUL. TO THOSE WHO ARE IN IT THEREFORE THERE IS NO FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTION TO IT WHAT THIS LAW DOES IS MAKES EXPLICIT ALL THOSE ASSUMED PRECONDITIONS. FOR ADULTS AND REQUIRES PROOF OF THOSE ABUSES BEFORE ANYTHING CAN BE DONE ABOUT THE MATERIALS- AND I'D ALSO BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION. OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF PROTECTING CHILDREN- WITHOUT ALSO OF PROTECTING COERCED ADULTS ARE WHEN IT COMES TO NAKED AND SEXUAL MATERIALS. ARE MADE WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION- I THINK AS HE IS RECOGNIZED BY- THIS LARGER CONVERSATION ABOUT. THE PROBLEMS OF DIGITAL MEDIA- AND THAT IT IS PAST TIME FOR THE LAW TO CATCH UP WITH PREDATORS WHO HAVE LONG BEEN ALLOWED TO OPERATE IN THE LEGAL SHADOWS BUT ACTUALLY ON THE BRIGHT CUTTING EDGE. OF VISIBLE TECHNOLOGY. OF SEX TRAFFICKING CHILDREN AND ADULTS MOSTLY WOMEN AND GIRLS ALSO TRANS PEOPLE- REAPING GARGANTUAN PROFITS AND CONTINUING TO EVADE ACCOUNTABILITY IN WAYS THAT DAMAGE EVEN DESTROY LIVES WITH IMPUNITY. SO THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND I REGRET I WASN'T ABLE TO BE PRESENT A BECAUSE OF TEACHING. OF FOR THE LEGAL PAN ALL OF THAT PRECEDED SURE I HAVE LEARNED A LOT FROM IT AND- I WOULDN'T. UP BUT WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT ARE THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN RISE TO BY- BOTH OF THE EXPERTISE ON THAT PANEL AND ANY QUESTIONS. THAT THE SENATORS ARE OTHERS MAY HAVE. THANK YOU PROFESSOR MACKINNON QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THE CORTESE. PROFESSOR IT A MINUTE BERMAN A RISK PER- SURE PREFER MISTER FREEZING OR- RESTATING. SOMETHING THAT WAS SAID EARLIER THERE PRESENTED EARLIER AND I APOLOGIZE- PROBABLY NOT SO MUCH TO YOU. TO THAT BUT TO THOSE. WHO OF WHO I'M TRYING TO PARAPHRASE BUT- WE WERE- EARLIER PRESENTED WITH A LOT OF REALLY GOOD INFORMATION ON BOTH THE FIRST AMENDMENT- CAN SECTION TWO THIRTY IN TERMS OF WHAT. HE YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY IN THIS IS A PARAPHRASE THIS IS MY OWN TAKEAWAY- WE SEEM TO PRESENT IT ALMOST- AN IMPENETRABLE FORTRESS OF. OF OBSTACLE CREATED- BY PARTICULARLY SECTION TWO THIRTY- BUT TO SOME EXTENT OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT- AND I APPRECIATE YOU SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY TO THE BILL- IN YOUR PRESENTATION- THAT I HAVE PENDING- BUT ASIDE FROM AS BEFORE THIRTY FIVE I REALLY ONE OF U. S. AS AN EXPERT- IN THIS AREA- WHICH I ASKED OF THEM. IT HE IF YOU KNOW HOW FRAME IT THIS WAY- I BELIEVE THAT WE WERE TOLD BY EARLY PRESENTATION THAT IT IS IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CREATE PRIVATE CAUSES OF ACTION. IN THE AREAS THAT YOU WERE JUST DESCRIBING- IN TERMS OF TRAFFICKING AND SO FORTH- WITHOUT RUNNING AFOUL OF SECTION TWO THIRTY IN PERHAPS EVEN- FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTIONS- I THINK THERE WERE. SEVERAL QUESTIONS ASKED BY. MY COLLEAGUES HERE ON THE DAIS BUT WITH REGARD. TO WHETHER OR NOT UNPROTECTED SPEECH IS STILL COVERED BY SECTION TWO THIRTY OR OR OF COURSE THE FIRST AMENDMENT AS WE UNDERSTAND IT- THINGS LIKE FIGHTING WORDS AND SO FORTH- INTO THE DESIRE TO INCITE A RIOT HOPE WE UP HERE. I THINK MOST OF US UNDERSTAND IS UNPROTECTED SPEECH- IS IT GOING BACK TO THE ONLINE TRAFFICKING ISSUE THAT AS YOU DESCRIBED IT OR TO IT. IS UNPROTECTED IS A- ARE IN GENERAL HOW DO YOU COPE HOUSES POSITION TO ALLOW. ONCE NOTICED IS DENIED HE'S PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTION IN EUROPEAN WE HEARD OTHERS OPINIONS ON THAT. WELL YOU KNOW IN A SENSE IT'S A GENERAL DISCUSSION ABOUT THE WHOLE ARRAY OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU'RE CONFRONTING HERE AS IN MIS INFORMATION FOR EXAMPLE- THERE IS NO QUESTION BUT THAT INFORMATION IS SPEECH- IF YOU CAN EVEN BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT MISINFORMATION- YOU'RE ALREADY WAY BEYOND SOMETHING I'M TALKING ABOUT HERE- BECAUSE YOU'RE DEFINING WHAT'S ACCURATE AND WHAT'S NOT ACCURATE- IN TERMS OF INFORMATION THAT IS ALLOWED TO BE SPOKEN. OUT THERE- THIS IN ALL THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT YOU KNOW ELECTION LIES AND BUT WHATEVER- AND IS TEMP TO YOU KNOW PRIVATE COMPANIES OF TAKING IT DOWN THAT'S NOT IN A FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUE BUT- MOVING INTO REGULATION THERE ARE ALSO REGULATION OF ALGORITHMS WHICH- OPERATE TO MULTIPLY MULTIPLY- ACCESS TO. A SIMILAR MATERIALS ACROSS- THE ACROSS PLATFORMS AND NETWORKS. IF YOU'RE EVEN CONSIDERING- LEGAL APPROACHES TO ANY OF THAT ALL OF THIS. I YOU KNOW WE HAVE- FRANCES HOGAN GOING BEFORE CONGRESS JUST TO SAY TO EXPAND ON THIS PARTICULAR MORE GENERAL POINT AND THEN I'LL ANSWER THE MORE SPECIFIC ONE- ABOUT ABOUT YOUR BILL SENATOR IS. THAT SHE IS SAYING THAT OTHER MATERIALS OUT THERE BIG YOUNG TEENAGE GIRLS FEEL BETTER ABOUT THEMSELVES AND THEREFORE PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO THAT IS THEIR BODY IMAGE AND SO ON- WHAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO. TO ADDRESS THAT HARM REDUCE. REGULATE THE INDUSTRY SUCH THAT. IT DOESN'T DO THAT ANYMORE WELL LOOK- EVERYTHING THAT I AM TALKING ABOUT IS WAY MORE DIRECT WAY MORE HARMFUL WAY MORE DRAMATIC. WE'RE TALKING I'M IN THIS IS ABOUT MATERIALS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY FORCING PEOPLE TO MAKE THEM OR THEY HAVE BEEN MADE BY SPYING ON PEOPLE- BY UP THROUGH. BROUGHT US THROUGH SAYING ONE THING AND HAVING IT BE ANOTHER AND THEN STEALING PEOPLE'S ACTUAL OWN OF MATERIALS OF THEMSELVES IN A WAY. THAT PRODUCES DRAMATIC HARMS THAT ARE PROVABLE IN NO WAY SPECULATIVE NOT A GROUP BASED HARM EVEN IT'S A PRIVATE CAUSE OF ACTION FOR DIRECT PROVEN HARM AND THE HARM IS THE HARM OF BEING SEX TRAFFICKED ON EIGHTEEN ON A NETWORK OR PLATFORM OUT THERE- AND- IT. SOMEHOW. THE NOTION THAT WILL AND CAN CONSIDER- CUTTING BACK ON MISINFORMATION AND MAKING YOUNG TEENAGE GIRLS FEEL BAD ABOUT THEMSELVES BUT ABSOLUTELY WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT COURSE MATERIALS MATERIALS CREATED THROUGH FRAUD STOLEN MATERIALS MATERIALS THAT PEOPLE- A THAT WERE EITHER CREATED OR DISTRIBUTED ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE OR PERMISSION. THAT IS INTRUSIVE VIOLATING AND DESTRUCTIVE OF THEIR LIVES GOING FORWARD- IN EXACTLY THE WAYS THAT- ARE ACTUALLY CHILD FACT. MOST PEOPLE- YOU KNOW A LOT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE VIOLATED AS CHILDREN AND THEN CONTINUE TO BE VIOLATED AS ADULTS IN A LOT OF CASES A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SEX TRAFFICKED ONLINE IT WAS DONE TO THEM AS CHILDREN EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE NOW ADULTS- AND- A LOT OF THEM. WERE MATURE AS CHILDREN AND THEREFORE APPEAR TO BE ADULTS AND THEREFORE THE CHILD **** LAWS DON'T PROTECT THEM BECAUSE- YOU HAVE TO HAVE KNOWN THAT THIS WAS A CHILD IN OTHER WORDS THEY ONLY ESSENTIALLY APPLY TO PRE PUBESCENT CHILDREN- AND- THE OTHER THING TO POINT OUT IS THAT. IT IS ALREADY A FEDERALLY ILLEGAL TO ADVERTISE OF. PEOPLE FOR WHAT IS THAN SEX TRAFFICKING WELL THIS IS ALL. SEX TRAFFICKING BY THE FEDERAL DEFINITION OF WHAT SEX TRAFFICKING IS WHICH IS FORCE FRAUD COERCION. AND NOW WE'RE SAYING IT CAN'T YOU KNOW WHEN THERE IS NOTICE OF THIS IT CAN'T BE SOLD- THE IDEA OF IT I MEAN. IT OBVIOUSLY ISN'T THE FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTED SPEECH OF THE PEOPLE IN IT BECAUSE- THAT ISN'T THEIR SPEECH. IT IS BEEN STOLEN BY SOMEONE THEY HAVE BEEN COERCED INTO MAKING IT IT HAS BEEN. THEY HAVE BEEN VIOLATED IN IN WAYS AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO BE VIOLATED FURTHER OF WHEN% NOTHING CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT WHEN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE CERTAINLY ARE SEEING THEIR SEEING THEM AND THEN CAN DOWNLOADED AND SALAS SO YOU KNOW THE NOTION THAT THERE IS ANY. ESTABLISHED FIRST AMENDMENT BLOCK TO THIS IS NOT ACCURATE AS TO THE FIRST AMENDMENT- AND AS THE SECTION TWO THIRTY AS I SAID THE WHOLE POINT OF IT. IS TO. PRE VENT. OF PLATFORMS THAT COULD HAVE HAD NO IDEA THAT THIS WAS HAPPENING ON THEM AS IT TURNS OUT PORN HUB IN OTHERS. UP HERE YOU KNOW WE MAY WELL HAVE HAD QUITE A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT WAS OUT THERE BECAUSE THE MINUTE THEY REALLY STARTED LIVING UP TO WHAT THEY SAY THEY DO. AND LOOKING INTO AFTER THEY WERE SUED. BY PEOPLE WHO SAY HEY- THERE ON YOUR ON YOU AND- I WAS A CHILD I WAS COERCED I WAS RAPED. WHEN THIS WAS MADE I NEVER GAVE PERMISSION FOR THIS TO BE OUT THERE SUDDENLY THEY DISCOVERED THAT THERE'S HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS. OF MATERIALS OUT THERE WHERE. THEY WERE RAPED- THEY WERE CHILDREN- THAT HAS BEEN THE CASE ALL ALONG- BUT NOTHING WAS DONE ABOUT IT NOT BY THEM NOT BY ANYBODY. AND YOU KNO SO NOW- THAT CASE IS SETTLED WE DON'TKNOW ON WHAT TRMS- BUT- THERE WAS NO BLANKET FIRST AMENDMENT PART. THERE APPARENTLY WAS NO BLANKETS- SECTION TWO THIRTY PART OF THAT- IN ANY CASE- YOU KNOW THAT AS AS WE HAD TO. OF THE FOR THAT THERE WAS NO EXPRESSED. LEGAL CLAIM SUCH AS SB FOUR THIRTY FIVE WOULD PROVIDE- ALLOWED IT TO GO ON AND IT IS STILL GOING ON. SO- I YOU KNOW I JUST THINK PEOPLE ARE LAWYERS ARE. NOT ACCURATELY REPORTING BUT FIRST AMENDMENT LAW IS OR WHAT THE POINT OF SECTION TWO THIRTY IS- YOU KNOW IF SECTION TWO THIRTY WAS DOING WHAT THEY SAID IT DOES- THE FEDERAL LAW AGAINST TRAFFICKING PEOPLE FOR SEX BY ADVERTISING WHAT IS SEX TRAFFICKING ONLINE ITSELF WOULD BE ILLEGAL- I MEAN I DIDN'T HEAR THE CONVERSATION BUT- NEITHER NEITHER OF THOSE IS RIGHT. THE PROFESSOR I'M SORRY GO AHEAD- JUST CAN SAY THANK YOU FOR RESPONSE AND- PROFESSOR MACKINNON YEAH AND THE- EARLIER TO WITNESSES MISS KELLER AND PROFESSOR GOLDMAN TESTIFIED AS TO THE CHALLENGES FIRST AMENDMENT AS WELL AS SECTION TWO THIRTY CHALLENGES- FOR A STATE TO BE LEGISLATING IN THIS SPACE. WHILE WE ARE LIMITED IN TERMS OF TIME I PERSONALLY AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE WOULD WELCOME ANY KIND OF WRITING OR THINKING YOU'VE DONE ON THIS SUBJECT AS TO HOW WE CAN- ADDRESS THIS HARM AND IF THERE'S ANY DEBATE THAT. THERE'S SIGNIFICANT HARM THAT CAN BE DONE ON THE NET AND I DON'T THINK IT'S A DEBATE THAT WE AS ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY TO ADDRESS THAT HARM SO THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- LET ME CHANNEL OF SENATOR PANDAS CENTER STERN MENTIONED AWHILE AGO CENTER P. AND COULDN'T BE HERE- BUT A QUESTION TO. MR HOFFMAN WITH RESPECT TO NOT CONTENT MODERATION BUT TO TRANSPARENCY IN TERMS OF AMPLIFICATION AS TO- WHEN IT APPEARS. AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE- READ THAT I'VE DONE THAT THERE IS AN INCENTIVE FOR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO- PROMOTE THE SALACIOUS AND SOMETIMES THE HARMFUL MATERIAL BECAUSE IT IT DRIES UP- CLICKS. SO IN TERMS OF THAT MISTER HOFFMAN I'D BE INTERESTED IN YOUR THOUGHTS IS TO- WHERE WE GO TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY. AS TO THE ALGORITHMS AND THE METHODS USED. TO AMPLIFY THAT THAT SORT OF MATERIAL. YES CERTAINLY HAPPY TO TRY TO SPEAK TO THAT- YOU KNOW I THINK. WHILE ABSOLUTELY I THINK THERE'S MORE ENGAGEMENT- RESOURCES CONTENT I DON'T THINK THAT CAN BE DIVIDE- I THINK THE REASON THAT THERE IS MORE ENGAGEMENT ON CERTAIN POSTS OR OTHERS- AND THE REASON IS THE LINE THAT CAN BE SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED I'LL GIVE YOU A QUICK EXAMPLE- A LOT OF STE SOME OF THE TOP PERFORMING MAKES ON OUR OUR SOCIAL MEDIA SITES- ARE POLITICAL- AND- DID ENGAGEMENT. FOR THOSE CAN BOTH BE COMING FROM IF IT'S A CAR RIGHT POWER STARTS A ROAD LAST POST I CAN BE COMING FROM BOTH SIDES WHERE- IF IT'S MISINFORMATION OR AGENTS SOME- OUTRAGEOUS COMMENT FROM A POLITICAL LEADER- YOU'VE GOT FOLKS TRYING TO DEMAND TO AND- AND DOWN FLAT AND SO. YOU KNOW I THINK WILD YES THAT DOES DRIVES ENGAGEMENT AND KEEPS PEOPLE ENGAGED IT'S NOT THE ONLY REASON THAT PEOPLE USE OUR SITES EITHER- I'M SORRY YOU KNOW WHEN. SUCH HAVE IMPLEMENTED- DIFFERENT MARRIAGES FOR EXAMPLE- WE FIND RATES THAT PEOPLE ARE USING ANGRY BUT THEY'RE ALSO USING OTHER EMERGES TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES WHILE IN A WHILE YOU KNOW I I'VE NOTED BEFORE. OUR OUR SITES TO- THE REAL WORLD- YOU KNOW I THNK THE- ANGRY AND- MAYBE MORE VITRIOLIC AND OUTRAGEOUS- POST GET A LOT OF ATTENTION- THE ONES THAT- DON'T EXHIBIT THAT DON'T GET AS MUCH ATTENTION WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS. AS FAR AS TRANSPARENCY INTO THE ALGORITHMS- YEAH I THINK YOU KNOW WE CAN START TO TALK ABOUT WHAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WE CAN- PROVIDE I THINK YOU KNOW WE START TO RUN INTO WHERE- WHERE SOME OF THESE ALGORITHMS THAT THEY ARE PROPRIETARY ITS POWER COMPANIES- ARE VALUED- THAT'S WHY THEY COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER- TO DEVELOP BETTER. ALGORITHMS- AND SO YOU KNOW THERE THERE WILL SOME WOMEN AS TO WHY ARE WE ARE WILLING TO DO. AND BUT YOU RETURN BEFORE STATUS. I THINK APPROPRIATE GUARDRAIL WERE NOT- WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT TYPE OF. I WILL BE AB CRUCIAL. THANK YOU- WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION THERE ARE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MEASURES THAT ARE PENDING- WE BEGAN THIS. HEARING WITH TESTIMONY THAT THERE SHOULD BE A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY THAT. PROVIDES SOME SORT OF CONTENT MODERATION THAT THAT'S A CHALLENGE- GIVEN BOTH SECTION TWO THIRTY IN THE FIRST MOMENT IN A NUMBER OF OTHER ISSUES HAVE BEEN RAISED HERE.
