STARTED TO GIVE THEM A CALL THANKS. YEAH. YOU KNOW OUR FIRST AUTHOR FOR FILE ITEM ONE AB TWENTY TWO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE WELCOME. THANK YOU. AND I WANT TO THINK THE CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND I REALLY I WANT TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THIS SUGGESTED COMMITTEE AENDMENTS ON PAGE FOUR OF THE ANNOUNCES AND THINK THE CHAIR I KNOW WE SEE THIS ALL THE TIME THINK THE CHAIR AND IS CHIEF CONSULTANT AS ANGLE BUT I REALLY MEAN IT THIS TIME I APPRECIATE HOW MUCH TIME AND EFFORT WE HAVE SUCKED FROM YOU GUYS AND HOW MUCH PATIENCE YOU HAD WITH US FOR- EVERYONE KNOWS I'M PRETTY PASSIONATE AND YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY SHIN AND I APPRECIATE YOU SO MUCH- EVERYONE. AND QUITE FRANKLY THIS IS A WHAT HOW IS THE MIDST OF A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS LIKE MOST OF YOU I SPEND MY TIME TRY AND BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN MY DISTRICT IN SACRAMENTO THE TWO AREAS COULD NOT BE MORE DIFFERENT BUT FOR TOP. START DEVELOP THE CITY AND SKATE. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO LOOK IN ANY DIRECTION AND NOT SEE TENTS MAKESHIFT SHELTERS ENCAMPMENTS AND PEOPLE CALLING THE STREETS AND SIDEWALKS HOME. THIS ISN'T A NUISANCE THIS ISN'T A PROBLEM. THIS IS A CRISIS OF EPIDEMIC PROPORTION. AND DESPERATE TIMES CALL FOR BOLD ACTION. THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY ESTABLISHES A RIGHT TO HOUSING FOR ALL CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA AND MAKES IT THE POLICY OF THE STATE THAT NO CHILD. GO WITHOUT A HOME. LAST YEAR I MET WITH ELECTED OFFICIALS AND HOUSING ADVOCATES IN NEW YORK CITY WHO WALK ME THROUGH THE SUCCESSES AND PITFALLS OF THEIR RIGHT TO SHELTER MODEL. OTHER PEOPLE WERE MOVED UP THE STREET IN NEW YORK CITY AND INTO SHELTERS THERE WAS NO CLEAR TRANSITION TO PERMANENT HOUSING AFTER TEMPORARY SHELTER. WHILE NEW YORK'S PROCESS LOOK LIKE IT HAD SOLVE THE CITY'S HOMELESS PROBLEM IT ACTUALLY ONLY TEMPORARILY DISGUISED. AND IT LEFT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MORE TRAUMATIZED AND DESPERATE IN ITS WAKE. IN CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO DO BETTER AND WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW TO DO BETTER. IF WE DO NOT TO THOUGHTFUL BOLD ACTION OTHERS WELL. DECISIONS WILL BE MADE BY COSTLY PROPOSITIONS OR BY COURT-DECISION AND ONCE AGAIN THIS LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE NO ONE TO BLAME BUT OURSELVES. LEARNING FROM THE EXPERIENCES OF OTHER CITIES IN STATE AB TWENTY TWO. INSTEAD EMPHASIZES THAT PERMIT HOUSING IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN AND HOMELESSNESS AND PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK OUTLINES BEST PRACTICES TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS. WHICH INCLUDE PREVENTING FAMILIES FROM LOSING THEIR HOME IN THE FIRST PLACE FOR ASSISTANCE THE RENT UTILITIES AND CONNECTING THEM WITH SERVICES TO ADDRESS FACTORS THAT CAN LEAD TO HOMELESSNESS. SECOND BY PROVIDING EMERGENCY ACCOMMODATIONS WITH SUPPORTIVE SERVICES SHOULD A FAMILY LOSE THEIR HOME. WHICH CAN INCLUDE SHELTERS AND OR BRIDGE HOUSING TRANSITIONING THE FAMILY TO PERMIT HOUSING WHILE FOSTERING A CULTURE OF DIGNITY AND RESPECT THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS TO MINIMIZE. THE TRAUMA AND DESTRUCTION TO DAILY LIFE. THE MEMONS TAKEN TODAY WILL ALSO RESULT IN BETTER COORDINATION ACROSS STATE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES TO STREAMLINE AND INTEGRATE POLICIES AND SERVICES TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS. DATA FROM THIS YEAR'S US DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT ANNUAL HOMELESS ASSESSMENT REPORT SHOWS THAT CALIFORNIA'S TOTAL HOMELESS POPULATION IS OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. WHICH IS THE HIGHEST IN THE COUNTRY AND APPROXIMATELY ONE FOURTH OF THE NATION'S TOTAL HOMELESS POPULATION. CALIFORNIA HAS A MORAL OBLIGATION TO THE MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN ACHIEVE THE STABILITY OF PERMANENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. HOW MUCH THIS IS AN ISSUE OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AS WELL IT'S DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS BLACK CALIFORNIANS WHO REPRESENT 30% OF THE STATE'S HOMELESS POPULATION BUT ONLY ACCOUNT FOR SIX POINT 5% OF THE TOTAL POPULATION. BEYOND THE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY CALIFORNIA ALSO AS A FISCAL OBLIGATION TO HOUSE ARE HOMELESS FAMILIES. THE CHANCE THAT A CHILD WILL ENTER THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM INCREASES FROM 10240% WHEN THE CHILD IS SUBJECT TO NINETY OR MORE DAYS WITHOUT A PLACE TO RESIDE. IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THE ANY FOR CHILD IN FOSTER CARE IS NEARLY NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE ANNUAL COST TO INCARCERATE AN INDIVIDUAL IN CALIFORNIA'S APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS ACCORDING TO THE LA L. BY COMPARISON THE AVERAGE ANNUAL COST TO RENT A TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT IN THE STATE IS LESS THAN TWENTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. I WANT TO ASSURE YOU. I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS CONVERSATION. IT'S STILL WE'RE STILL IN CONVERSATIONS AND THERE'S A LOT STILL TO BE DISCUSSED WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE GOVERNOR'S COUNCIL ON REGIONAL HOMELESS ADVISORS AS WELL AS- ADVOCATES IN THIS IN THIS STATE AND OTHERS. I APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR'S RECENT BUDGET PROPOSALS AND EXECUTIVE ORDERS ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR BY STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AS WE EVALUATE THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE COUNCIL. AS STATED IN THE CAPSULES RECOMMENDATIONS RELEASE MONDAY THE STATE MUST ESTABLISH IN LAW. THAT IT IS NOT MORAL ARE LEGALLY ACCEPTABLE TO DENY HOUSING FOR PEOPLE ON THE STREETS AND CREATE THE LEGAL MANDATES AND FUNDING MECHANISMS NECESSARILY TERM BUT NECESSARY TO DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE. THIS AN ACCEPTABLE CONDITION. AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE AWARE- MERRILY SHOP IS ALSO ON SITS ON COUNCIL. AND SAID YESTERDAY AFTER A AFTER INCIDENT. IN THAT SHE SAID THAT SHE WOULD WELCOME MANDY BECAUSE IT WOULD ENSURE THAT SURROUNDING COMMITTEES WEREN'T ADDING TO HER CITIES PROBLEMS. QUOTE I NEED OTHER CITIES TO BE DOING THEIR PART BECAUSE OAKLAND DOES NOT EXIST ON AN ISLAND. IT IS MY BELIEF THAT ESTABLISHING THIS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO HOUSING MOVES US FROM A PURELY VOLUNTARY EFFORT TO ONE THAT CREATES ACCOUNTABILITY. SO FAR WE HAVE THIRTEEN MEMBERSFROM BOTH HOUSES AND BOTH PARTIES WHO HAVE BEEN ADDED AS CO AUTHORS OF THE BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WITH ME TODAY IS BOOK APPEARS COMMISSION OF A LOS ANGELES HOMELESS SERVICES. AUTHORITY TO YOUR WITNESS. OUR GUEST BOOK APPEARS AND I'M A COMMISSIONER WITH THE LOS ANGELES HOMELESS SERVICES AUTHORITY APPOINTED BY THE MAYOR AND I AM- CHAIR OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY COMMISSION OWN DPSS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVICES APPOINTED BY OF. MARK RIDLEY THOMAS. I AM SPEAKING AS MYSELF TODAY WE HAVE WHAT WE BOTH BODIES HAVE LOOKED AT THIS LEGISLATION AND WE APPLAUD DIDN'T CHANGES AND WE WILL TAKE IT UP WHEN THE FINALIZED. WORK VERBIAGE- APPEARS BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S UNITS. IT'S TOO LATE FOR US TO TAKE A OPPOSITION IT DID IN GENERAL WE SUPPORT THIS EFFORT OF VIGOROUSLY OF WHAT I'D LIKE TO- IN ADDITION TO THE FACTS THAT THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN HAS- PRESENTED I'D LIKE TO PRESENT A FEW MORE FACTS. THERE I THINK YOU KNOW AS SHE SAID. HOW CHILD HOMELESSNESS HOMELESS CHILDREN. IS NOT ONLY MORALLY BANKRUPT. AS A THANK YOU A KID CONVENTION- QUITE EASILY THERE'S ECONOMIC SUICIDE- IT IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER TYPES OF HOMELESSNESS- IT HAS DIFFERENT INTERVENTIONS. AND THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF CHILD HOMELESSNESS A VERY DIFFERENT. THAN OTHER TYPES OF HOMELESSNESS- SOME OF THE FACTS- THERE SHE DIDN'T ACTUALLY IN ONE IN SOME OF THE PAPERS. IS 87% OF HOMELESS SCHOOL. SO THAT MEANS 13% OF THESE KIDS CAN GET A JOB AT MCDONALD'S. THE ECONOMIC ROUND TABLE TO STUDY FOR THIS FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES TWO YEARS AGO AND WAS REALLY LOOKING TO CALL THE ANTECEDENTS OF CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS WHAT CAUSES CHRONIC HOMES. AND THEIR CONCLUSION WAS THAT WE WILL NEVER. BEGAN TO END CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS TYPICALLY ADULT HOMES. UNLESS WE START HOUSING THE THOUSANDS OF HOMELESS CHILDREN ON THE STREETS OF LOS ANGELES EVERY NIGHT. SO IF WE DON'T STOP THE FLOW. AND ONLY ADDRESS THE OUTPUT OF CHILD HOMELESSNESS. WE JUST WILL NEVER GET OUR HANDS ON THIS PROBLEM. THE. THE LA COUNTY IS YOU KNOW HAS HAD THIS MANDATE THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS NOW WE HAVEN'T JUST LIKE OF MICHELLE SAID WE HAVEN'T COME CLOSE TO. MAKING THE MANDATE OF POSSIBLE BECAUSE EVERY YEAR WE HAVE MORE AND MORE FAMILIES COMING IN WITH THE ONLY WAY IT WHERE AN ISLAND IN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WE KNOW THAT WE CANNOT ADDRESSES PROBLEM WITHOUT OTHER CITIES AND COUNTIES- JUMPING IN TO HELP US. THE. THE PORTLAND TRY HAS DONE THIS TWO YEARS AGO THE SAME THING ABOVE MOST HOME COUNTY AND CITY OF PORTLAND GOT TO GO SAYS WE'RE GOING TO LA COUNTY NINE ZERO HOMELESS CHILDREN ON OUR STREETS AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH TO SELECT THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN SAID IN A SAFE SECURE SHELTER GOING TO BRIDGE HOUSING GOING TO APARTMENT HOUSE. WELL THEY HAD PEOPLE COMING FROM IDAHO WASHINGTON IN THE COAST. AND THEY RAN OUT OF MONEY IN SIX MONTHS THE GOVERNOR GAME OF COUPLE MORE MILLION DOLLARS NAY AROUND OUT OF THAT. AND THEY- AT THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS. HAS DONE THIS TWELVE YEARS AGO. AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS AT FIRST BUT WE CAN WE KNOW WHAT THEY DID AS SOLUTIONS THE USED EVERY MOTEL EVERY BED AND BREAKFAST IN THE WHOLE STATE AND THEY STILL COULDN'T FIND PLACES TO PUT THESE FAMILIES RIGHT NOW I THINK THEY LOOK THEY RENT LESS THAN- WAY LESS THAN A HUNDRED MOTEL ROOMS. FOR THE WHOLE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS AND THAT'S ACTUALLY COMING OUT THE WIDE IN THE RIVER RESTRICTIONS ON WHAT FAMILIES APPLY SO. AGAIN I THINK THAT OF. IT IS MORALLY BANKRUPT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY BECAUSE NO NO ONE. NO ONE SHOULD LEVEL MYSTERY. WHICH CHILDREN HAVE A LONG TERM AFFECTED LIVE A LONG TIME. THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS. AND THE TRAUMA THEY GO THROUGH WILL LAST THE REST OF THEIR LIVES THEY WILL NOT WORK. THERE WAS SPENDING A LOT AND WHEN THEY GET TO FOSTER CARE THAT'S A PIPELINE. THE GOES IMMEDIATELY TO PRISON GANGS DEATH. SO WE LOSE ALL OF IT THAT'S OUR OUR PRODUCT THAT'S ALL WE HAVE IS OUR CHILDREN. WE LOSE A HUGE PERCENT OF THOSE THOSE BABIES BASICALLY. SO THE ONLY THING ELSE- I WOULD. SUBMIT ALREADY HAD SIMPLY WOMAN DIDN'T GET TO MENTION. THAT OF. THE A. R. ANNUAL HOMELESSNESS REPORT TO CONGRESS WAS JUST OUT. OF CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION. WE HAVE THE FIVE CITIES AND COUNTIES. WITH THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF ONE SHELTERED HOMELESS CHILDREN IN UNITED STATES THE TOP FIVE. WE GOT A MALL. SACRAMENTO HAS 50% LEADS EVEN LEASE CALIFORNIA BUT THEN YOU GOT LA LONG BEACH SAN DIEGO SAN JOSE CELL. I THINK NOT ONLY IS IT AS I SAID- MORALLY REPUGNANT TO LEAVE CHILDREN SLEEPING OUTSIDE. BUT IS ALSO- ECONOMIC SUICIDE BUT I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL. LOUIS MONDAY WITH CALIFORNIAN BE WE HAD A SUPPORT LETTER IN ON A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE BILL HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO REVIEW MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS BUT- WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO MOVE THE POLICY FOR TODAY. THANKS. GOOD MORNING SHERMAN WAS THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR I'M HAVING THIS BILL HEARD BEFORE YOU- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE HAS BEEN A- SUPPORTER OF ANTI POPPING CALIFORNIA CAMPAIGN SORRY JACQUI HUANG. GRAPHIC THE GRACES TO IT AND THEN TELL PART IN CALIFORNIA CAMPAIGN. I'M A LOT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THAT WE MADE OR ACTION THAT IT. AND THE RIGHT TO HOUSING- BUT WE ALSO AGREE WITH THE COMMITTEE'S. ASSERTION THAT ON WHICH AFTER THINK ABOUT MORE- PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING OVERALL SO WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. IT WILL BE A SOLUTION ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA AND SUPPORT THANK. LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. XENON LIGHTS UP BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE OF WILL KICK OFF THE CONVERSATION LET ME FIRST START BY THANKING THE AUTHOR AND YOUR STAFF AS WELL AS- MY CHIEF CONSULTANT- FOR VERY DEEP ENGAGEMENT ON THIS AND I WOULD SAY AND SUGGESTS DOCKET PERSISTENCE ON THE PART OF THE AUTHOR. YOU AND I'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS- OPTICALLY DURING THE RECESS I THINK WE'VE BOTH LEARNED- EVEN MORE THAN WHAT WE HAD ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT HOMELESSNESS- IN THIS PAST- COUPLE OF MONTHS- AND ONE THING I'LL SAY THE OUTSET BECAUSE I'VE ANSWER THIS QUESTION TO A NUMBER OF OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC- THIS IS NOT. RIGHT TO SHELTER BILL- LET'S BECLEAR ABOUT THAT I THINK THE WAY THAT THAT IS UNDERSTOOD OPTICALLY FROM THE NEW YORK EXPERIENCE I AS WE SAY IN OUR STATE ANALYSIS IS- HAS HAD DECIDED WITH MIXED RESULTS IT FROM MY ACTIVE IT IS NOT. THE ANSWER TO THE CRISIS BECAUSE IT WOULD REALLY FOCUSED SO MANY OF ALL OF OUR RESOURCES TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE OF TEMPORARY SHELTER. AND AS OUR GOVERNOR SAID AND I AGREE THE- SHELTER SOL SLEEP. BUT HOW SERVICES SOLVES HOMELESSNESS AND I THINK WE NEED TO. THINK OF A REALLY BALLOTS APPROACH AS WE MOVE THIS FORWARD. I APPRECIATE AT THIS TIME THAT THIS BILL DECLARES THAT IS A POLICY- THAT ALL CHILDREN AND FAMILIES HAVE A RIGHT TO HOUSING THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT THAT'S AN IDEA THAT I AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT- WE KNOW THOUGH TO. CARRY THIS OUT- THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK TO BE DONE THE DOUBLE WILL BE IN DETAILS. IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE MORE THAN A POLICY STATEMENT. BOTH THE TREMENDOUS RESOURCES AS WELL AS ACCOUNTABILITY AND STANDARDS THE DEAL BOTH WITH SHORT COLLEGES AND LONG TERM CHALLENGES- FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF FAMILIES FACING. DIFFERENT CHALLENGES SO LOOKING FOR WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON THIS- HAPPY BE ADDED AS AN AUTHOR. AS WE HAVE DISCUSSED FROM THE BEGINNING OF OUR CONVERSATION AND WITH THAT OPEN IT TO OTHER CONVERSATIONS MISSED QUIRK SILVA FOLLOWED BY MISTER GORE. I WANNA APPLAUD THE AUTHOR I KNOW HOW MUCH TIME EVEN SPENDING ON THIS AS I'VE HEARD YOU PRESENT ABOUT THIS BEFORE. OF I TO AGREE ON THE POLICY YOU KNOW MAKING A DECLARATION THAT WE BELIEVE. CHILDREN AND FAMILY SHOULD BE HOUSE- IS- VERY SIGNIFICANT. ARE I AM. WOULD HAVE QUESTIONS AS THIS BILL MOVES AND OF COURSE ALL SUPPORT IT. IS ON SOME OF COURSE THE DETAILS ONE WOULD BE AS OF READ MORE ABOUT IT. IS I MEAN WE KNOW THAT KEEPING FAMILIES IN THEIR HOMES WHETHER IT BE. RESIDENTS OR OUR APARTMENT A RENTAL- ISOF A MANY WAYS. KEEPS THEM- IT'S MUCH HARDER TO GET HIM BACK INTO HOME ONCE THEY'VE BEEN EVICTED OR- UP BUT- PART. AS I THINK IS GOING TO REACH REQUIRE QUITE A BIT OF EDUCATION. IN IF WE. I JUST IN ORDER. BUDGET AND HAVE IT OF FUNDS THAT CAN BE USED AS SUBSIDIES FOR RENT AND HOW WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET FAMILIES TO UNDERSTAND A WELL BEFORE THEY MIGHT BE. A MONTH OR TWO- AWAY FROM LOSING THEIR HOME AS A TEACHER- I INITIALLY THREE DECADES DECADES AGO SPEND MOST OF MY TIME TIME TALKING ABOUT ACADEMICS WHEN I WOULD BE WITH PARENTS AS THE YEARS WENT ON AND IN THE LAST DECADE SPENT QUITE A BIT TOP NAME WORK WITH FAMILIES KEEP. UP AND LOCAL CHURCHES MIGHT HAVE HAD SOME SUPPORT FOR RENTAL SUBSIDIES BUT A LOT OF TIMES WHEN WE GET THE INFORMATION THE FAMILY WAS CLOSE TO GEN SOMETIMES EVEN WITHIN THE MONTH WHICH MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO THIS OF THESE FAMILIES SO- PART OF MOVING FORWARD AND TO BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON IT. IS TO MAKE SURE FAMILY AND ACT AS A SAFETY NET YOU KNOW WHAT OF THE SIX MONTHS SO THAT THERE CAN BE TIME TO REALLY MAKE. THAT SUPPORT AVAILABLE- SO WE DON'T HAVE THE LAST MONTH. WITH PEOPLE KNOCKING AT THEIR DOOR- SO AGAIN PART OF THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON END THANK YOU AND YES THE YORK CITY HAS HAD GREAT SUCCESS IN THEIR PREVENTION PROGRAM NOT JUST THE COMMISSIONER BANKS NOT BECAUSE THE COMMISSIONER THERE BUT ALSO THE HOUSING ADVOCATES SAY THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY BEEN ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PORTIONS OF THEIR- RIGHT TO SHELTER ACTUALLY THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PORTION OF THEIR- RIGHT TO SHELTER WHICH THIS IS A RIGHT HOUSING. HAS BEEN THE PREVENTION AND I PEOPLE FIGHT FOR LIKE THREE MONTHS RENT ARREARS HAS KEPT PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES AND BEEN ABLE TO GET THEM THROUGH JOB IN DROP TRAINING INTO JOBS SO THAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL AND MOST COST EFFECTIVE ACTUALLY PORTIONS OF THEIR PROGRAM. ONE JUST COMMENT WITH THAT FULLER DID IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW CITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE ADOPTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- OVERNIGHT PARKING PROGRAM WE TRIED LAST YEAR. AND THAT WAS NOT AN EASY LIFTED BUT NOW THAT THEY- STARTED IT'S BEEN ABOUT THREE MONTHS. AND THEY ARE NOT HAVING THIRTY FORTY CAR. THE NIGHT BECAUSE THERE'S GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO CAN PARK THERE BUT THE FAITH BASED COMMUNITY. IT HAS REALLY STEPPED UP TO ASSIST THESE FAMILIES WITH VERY SPECIFIC WHETHER IT BE- A RENTAL ASSISTANCE SO I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF COLLABORATION THAT WE CAN MAKE ONCE WE CAN IDENTIFY THE VERY SPECIFIC. TYPE OF NEED THAT THESE FAMILIES NEED TO EITHER. STAY IN A CAR IF THAT'S WHAT IT IS OR STAY IN THEIR HOME. THANK YOU MISTER GORE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN IN THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BRINGING THIS BEFORE US TODAY- THERE ARE I CAN'T THINK OF ANY ISSUE LARGER THAN THIS- FOR THE STATE CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY A FROM A CRISIS PERSPECTIVE AND TO EXTEND THE YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THE SECURITY OF THIS CRISIS I APPRECIATE IT I WANT TO ASK I THINK PERHAPS THE OBVIOUS QUESTION I THINK IT WAS LOU TO A BRIEFING YOUR TESTIMONY OF THE NARROW NARROW CASTING ON TO OPEN IN IN CHILDREN- I DEFINITELY SUBSCRIBE TO WOMEN CHILDREN FIRST- FOR MANY. MANY THINGS WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE SIZE AND SCALE OF THE- PROBLEM. IT SEEMS AS THOUGH WORSE. THIS IS LEGISLATION FOCUSES ON. A SMALL COMPONENT OF OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS- CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE NARROW CASTING OF THIS AND WHY IT ISN'T A PERHAPS MORE AMBITIOUS AND IT'S AN I AMBITIOUS IS. WORDS SO THERE'S NOTHING THAT WOULD MAKE ME HAPPIER THAN TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND IT A THINK RIGHT NOW WE'RE HOPING THAT. WHEN I STARTED MY POVERTY WORK I STARTED UNDER WITH CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND I WAS FORTUNATE AS WE MOVE FOR WITHOUT THAT THEY GOT EXPANDED TO EVERYONE. THAT THE TASK FORCE REPORT ACTUALLY ENDED UP INCLUDING EVERYONE- MY HOPE IS HONESTLY IS THAT THIS IS AN AMBITIOUS AND ITS AMBITIOUS WITH CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND- MY HOPE IS THAT IT'S- POINT ALONG THE LINE. UP OF MOMENTUM AND- PORT. BUT WE CAN'T EXPAND. MY HOPE THAT EVENTUALLY I DO BELIEVE EVERY SINGLE I THINK. CALIFORNIA SHOULD DO THAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN OUR COMMUNITY WHICH IS NOT HOMELESS AND HAS A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD AND SO I A AND I WITH EVERYONE ELSE WHO'S CONCERNED WE ACTUALLY HAD SPECIFIC COMP SHINS ABOUT. CARDS AND SOME PER FAMILY THAT HAVE YOU HAD THIS EXPERIENCE AND SO IT IS MY ASPIRATION AND MY AMBITION TO EVENTUALLY GET THERE- BUT THIS HAS BEEN A TRAGIC TO GET CHILDREN AND FAMILIES JUST TO THIS LEVEL. SO ANA. WE'VE GOT GOOD GRACES WE END UP WITH EVERYBODY. I'M UNDER THE MANDATE BUT FOR NOW WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO JUST WITH CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN IN I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I HAVE LAUNCHED BRIBE. IDEA THAT A PROBLEM OF THIS OP ED THIS COMPLEXITY- MIGHT BE ATTACKED TACKLED IN DIGESTIBLE PIECES IF YOU WILL FOCUS ON VETERANS FOCUS ON. FOCUS ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS TRANSITION AGE IF YOU- BUT AS A STATED GOAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I PERSONALLY COMFORTABLE WITH SIGN UP FOR ANYTHING LESS THAN EVERYBODY OFF THE STREETS. AND WE MAY NOT HIT THAT GOAL. BUT I DID BUT WHO DECIDES THAT GOAL I'M IN. THE WHAT. EXCEPT THE- SHELTER PEOPLE THE STATUS BECAUSE FOR THEM THE NOT. ZERO AND THAT SHOULD BE OUR FOCUS. THAT IS A CHALLENGE I HAVE HERE BUT AGAIN I UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO DO DIGESTIBLE PIECES IN A GENERAL COMMITMENT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE TRUE OBJECTIVE IS- I THINK THE CONCERN THAT ALL OF US SHOULD HAVE THESE MANY OF OUR BECAUSE YOU. WONDER DO WE GET WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR COMMUNITIES. DO I SEE IT EVERY SINGLE DAY I HAVE PEOPLE LIVING IN THEIR CARD FOR MY HOME- I UNDERSTAND HOW BIG THIS PROBLEM IS. I WOULD JUST BE CONCERNED THAT THE NARROW SCOPE THIS MAY SUGGEST TO THEM THAT WE DON'T. SPEAK SEVERELY. IN ADULT MALE. IS THE MAIN. REASON FOR COMPLAINTS. MAY RECEIVE. AND THAT THIS BILL WOULDN'T ADDRESS IT BUT I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I THINK THAT'S GOOD. THE SECOND OBSERVATION I WANT TO MAKE IS IN TERMS OF ENFORCEABILITY. I RECOGNIZE THAT THE VERY DIFFICULT SUBJECT. MY HOPE WOULD BE THAT THIS WOULD PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL LEGAL UNDERPINNINGS IN SUPPORT FOR THOSE WHO UNDERTAKE VERY DIFFICULT WORK CREATING HOUSE. FOR FOLKS. EVEN AS SYMPATHETIC AS WOMEN AND CHILDREN. CAN YOU SPEAK TO HOW WE CAN GET COMMUNITIES TO DO THEIR FAIR SHARE BECAUSE LET MISS QUIRK SILVA. MY COMMUNITY IS UNDER. A NUMBER OF ISSUE HIS. HOME I'M THIS IS THIS IS. THE DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE IN A POSITION OF TRYING TO. ACTUALLY TAKE THAT STEP I AGREE AND SO THERE'S TWO THINGS ONE. TING DATA AS TO THE PROGRESS SO THAT WE ARE COLLECTING INFORMATION BUT THE GOAL OF THIS IS ACTUALLY TO CREATE ACCOUNTABILITY. THE I A TASK FORCE OF THE COUNCIL IN THEIR REPORTS SUGGESTED A PUBLIC RIGHT OF ACTION WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM AND WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND WITH OTHERS TO FIGURE WHAT THE APPROPRIATE TEETH SHOULD. BE I'M IF A PUBLIC RIGHT ACTION IS THE CORRECT. IS THAT CORRECT MECHANISM- AND WE ARE IN PROCESS OF FIGURING WHAT THE MECHANISM IS WITH HOW SOMETHING. THERE HAS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY WE HAVE SPENT AND IN THE LAST TWO DOLLARS ITS- WAS AND- LESS. INTO DOLLARS. WITHOUT ACCOUNTABILITY I THINK WE ALL SEE THAT IT IS AN ANALYST AT THIS AND I THINK THE MANDATE FINALLY PUTS AN END TO THAT IT SAYS. THIS MEANS IT'S NOT VOLUNTARY THIS MONEY MUST GO TO HOUSING NOT JUST PLANNING ANYMORE BUT TO DOING IT. AND SO I AGREE WITH YOU WE NEED THERE'S TEETH IN HERE BUT WE NEED STRONGER TEETH AND WHAT THAT MECHANISM LOOKS LIKE WE ARE IN PROCESS WITH EVERYBODY AND THE STAKEHOLDERS TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST. ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM BESIDES. MANDATE AND SAYING IT'S NO LONGER VOLUNTARY TO PLACE TO DO THESE PROJECTS WHAT I WOULD LOOK FOR THAT CONTINUED CONVERSATION GOING FOR NOW AND BY THE WAY WERE OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS WE'RE TAKING WE'RE TAKING A STEP ON THE ENFORCEMENT AND WE WANT AS MANY PEOPLE TO BE PART OF THAT CONVERSATION AS POSSIBLE I WOULD SAY THAT FOR THOSE WHO FEET AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM- YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN AS FAR ENOUGH TO FEAR AND- I THINK PARTICULARLY. FOR MAKING HONEST. ANY. BE ALMOST PEOPLE IS THAT THERE IS A WAY TO SWIFTLY GET THEM OFF THE STREETS AND MAKE THEIR- UNFILTERED EXPERIENCE BRIEF- AND HOPEFULLY ONE TIME- ANYWAY I IT GIVES MORE THOUGHT TO THE SUGGESTIONS- I DYSON'S DEFINITELY THINK WE ALL KNOW IN THIS ROUTE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DOING THAT ACTRESSES IN WHO ARE LEADING IN AND THOSE WHO ARE DRAGGING THEIR FEET MY HOPE WOULD BE THAT THOSE WERE DRAGGING THEIR FEET THAT THAT PROVIDE. SOME TENANTS FOR TO TAKE TO TAKE WHAT ARE. THESE WOMEN AND FRANKLY EVERY. MISTER CHAIRMAN WOULD BE THAT I WOULD ABSOLUTELY SUBSCRIBE TO THE- COMMITTEES- ANALYSIS SUGGESTION ABOUT PROMISE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING- IF YOUR COMMENTS AS WELL AS CHAIRMAN THAT THOSE ARE OF OUR GOVERNOR- WE HAVE A- TREMENDOUS- TEMPORARY TENT SYSTEM IN SAN DIEGO. ARE HUNDREDS OF SHELTER BEDS- THE GRADUATION RATE AT THE STATE IS ADEQUATE- BECAUS THERE'S NOT SUFFICIENT HOUSING- AND WHILE CERTAINLY AT A SHELTER BED IS PREFERABLE TO A STREET A SIDEWALK BUT ALI CANYON- YOU. WE SHOULDN'T BE IN THE BUSINESS ASSEMBLY JUST REMOVING THIS- THE OFFENSIVENESS OF PEOPLE'S EYES. AGREED AND IT REALLY SHOULD BE CENTERED ON THE INDIVIDUAL HELPING TO GET WHERE THEY ARE I THINK THAT THAT COULD SUGGESTION BY THE COMMITTEE SPEAKS TO THAT AND THAT WOULD ALSO BE SOMETHING THAT I WOULD WANT TO SIGN UP FOR SO JUST AGAIN FEEDBACK. WOULD BE YOU KNOW. DON'TDON'T SMALL GO BIGGEST PILE ANY RIGHT TO HOUSING IS BIT LIKE SO THIS IS RIGHT TO HOUSING IT'S NOT RIGHT DOES HOLDER FOR THAT EXACT REASON SO WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH YOU- GO BIG. NO ONE SHOULD BE ON THE STREETS NOT IN THE STATE THIS WEALTHY A NATION THIS WEALTHY- THERE. WE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABILITY CRITICALLY FOR COMMUNITIES IF YOU'RE AT- AND- HOUSING ASSAULTS HOMELESSNESS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. WE WANT PEOPLE TO GO BIG AND GO HOME. MR BLOOM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND LET ME TO SAY THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME O SERVE ON THE A COMMITTEE THIS MORNING I'VE BEEN AT THE TABLE OF PRESENTING BILLS- SO MANY TIMES IN THE PAST IT'S GOOD TO BE SITTING ON THE DIED PARTICIPATING IN THE DECISION MAKING- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR- FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORT. THIS IS A LOT OF IT UP. STREAMING IMPORTANT S. I'M AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'VE TAKEN THE- OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE STAFF OBVIOUSLY WORKED VERY HARD ON. I HAVEN'T SEEN THE LÏNG SHIA- AND SO I WANT TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE LANGUAGE I DID HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE BILL BEFORE THE AMENDMENTS AND I HAVE ONE LINGERING CONCERN THAT- ACTUALLY THAT MR GLORIA- VERY APPLE GET DRESSED AND THAT IS- I THINK THE- THAT. SINGLING OUT OF FAMILIES AND CHILDREN AS IMPORTANT AS THOSE COURTS OURS DOESN'T JEWEL'S ARE- IS THE WRONG APPROACH THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD SET OUT OF STANDARDS THAT APPLY ACROSS THE BOARD TO. EVERYONE SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT- I AND MY STAFF WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU ON I WOULD BUT I HAVE. AS THE BILL MOVES FOR. SEEING. THE BILL APPROPRIATIONS AND ON AND THE FULL THERE'S A COUPLE OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. AND UGH UGH I ALSO WANT TO THANK A MIS QUIRK SILVA FOR RAISING THE ISSUE THE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE OF. HOW WE CAN GO ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE DON'T BECOME HOMELESS IN THE FIRST PLACE- WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY MANY OF THOSE WHO ARE MOST AT RISK FOR BECOMING HOMELESS. WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE FALLING CUT INTO HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE OF FALLING OUT OF THEIR HOUSING BECAUSE IT'S BECOMING MORE AND MORE ON AFFORDABLE. WE HAVE TO PLACE MORE EFFORT ON THE ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES. AS OUR NOW AND THEY'VE NEVER BEEN AS WELL FUNDED AS THEY ARE TODAY. SPENDING ALL THAT MONEY WILL NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUE AND THE TIME IT WILL TAKE TO GET THOSE- UNITS ONLINE DOES NOT ALLOW US THE LUXURY OF WAITING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF THOSE WHO ARE AFFECTED NOW. A. I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A BROADER APPROACH HERE- IN TERMS OF COVERING EVERYBODY BY THESE BEST PRACTICES- OF BECAUSE- OUR OUTREACH WORKERS THE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY DOING THIS WORK ON THE STREET. NEED TO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL THAT THEY SEE IN EVERY INDIVIDUAL HAS A DIFFERENT SET OF NEEDS AND CONCERNS AND THE FACT IS- AT LEAST IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AS OF THE LAST. POINT IN TIME COUNT ABOUT 80% OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ARE THEY MAY BE HOMELESS BUT THEY'RE SHELTERED FOCUS. ATTENTION ON THE TWENTY. BUT THE FLIP SIDE WERE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ON THE STREET 80% OF INDIVIDUALS- ARE ON SHELTERED- FREQUENTLY- SUBSTANCE ABUSING. FREQUENTLY HAVING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. I AND THE- I WOULD JUST SAY THAT IF WE WERE TO BE TELLING OUR OUTREACH WORKERS ON THE STREET THAT THEY MUST PRIORITIZE ONLY CHILDREN AND FAMILIES- THAN PEOPLE LIKE NATHANIEL AYERS WHO- A STEVE LOPEZ VERY FAMOUSLY- IDENTIFIED IN HIS ONGOING SERIES. OF COLUMNS THE- AND THEN THE- WROTE A BOOK ABOUT AND A FILM THAT FOLLOWED ON HE NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND HOUSING THOSE INDIVIDUALS. AND WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO ADDRESS EVERYONE'S NEEDS AND WE CAN'T GIVE UP. UNTIL WE'VE- DONE THAT APPROPRIATELY. HI THIS ISSUE OF FAIR SHARE- THAT EVERY CITY- SHOULD BE CARRYING ITS- ITS ITS LOAD ON THIS ISSUE- YOUR WITNESS MISTER PEARSON DOES THAT- FOR EVERY YEAR OF THE FOURTEEN YEARS THAT I SERVED ON THE SANTA MONICA CITY COUNCIL THAT WAS A MANTRA FOR ME- IT FREQUENTLY FELL ON DEAF EARS. UNFORTUNATELY I THINK TO SOME DEGREE IT'S IT IS PART OF THE REASON THAT WE ARE WHERE WE ARE TODAY ON HOMELESSNESS AND WE THOUGHT IT BECOMES. CITY IS RESPONDING TO THIS ISSUE BECAUSE THE- IF YOU COME TO SANTA MONICA WEEK AGO TO VENICE IN IN YOUR DISTRICT TO. I HOPE WE WILL FIND A LARGE NUMBERS OF HOMELESS PEOPLE BUT THEY ARE FROM OUR NEIGHBORING YOU KNOW IT MAY BE THAT THERE ARE FEWER PEOPLE ON THE STREETS IN THE NEIGHBORING COMMUNITY BUT THE PEOPLE WERE SEEING ON THE STREETS IN OUR REGION. ARE FROM THE AREA BY AND LARGE- AND WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND WE NEED AND EVERYBODY NEEDS TO COLLECTIVELY DEAL WITH IT THE LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING TO YOU MORE ABOUT THAT THIS IS IT MOVES FORWARD. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL SUPPORTING IT THANK YOU. MR KILEY. A GOOD MORNING HI- I A LIKE HOW YOUR FOR I MEAN THIS IS THE RIGHT HOUSING AS OPPOSED TO RIGHT TO SHELTER I THINK THAT RAISES SOME INTERESTING POSSIBILITIES AND I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON MISTER GLORIOUS QUESTION ABOUT ENFORCEMENT- SO LET'S SAY THE REASON FOR SENATE MECHANISM LIKE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION YEAH PUBLIC RIGHT ACT ARE SORRY PUBLIC RIGHT OF ACTION. CLICK RIGHT OF ACTION WAS RECOMMENDED BY THE HOUSING COUNCIL THAT AMOUNT ON MONDAY GOTTA. SO THERE IS A MECHANISM LIKE THAT WOULD YOU BE ENVISIONED THIS IS MORE OF A POSITIVE WRITER AND NEGATIVE RIGHT SO YOU KNOW POSITIVE RIGHT WHERE YOU COULD- INVOKE IT. TO COMPEL- ACTION BY THE GOVERNMENT LIKE PROVIDING HOUSING OR NEGATIVE RIGHT WHERE YOU COULD- INVOKE IT TO. RESTRAIN OR BLOG GOVERNMENT ACTION THAT INTERFERES WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF HOUSING I MEAN I THINK IT ENDS UP BEING BOTH RIGHT I MEAN IF IT'S A PUBLIC RIGHT OF ACTION IT. IT SAYS IT IS IT IS THERE ARE. FOUR TO BE WELL IF LOCALS ARE NOT DOING THEIR FAIR SHARE TO ENFORCE THAT THEY DO THEIR FAIR SHARE AND IF IT FOR ANY REASON THEY'RE NOT DOING THEIR FOR SURE AND- THAT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT. BUILDING IT THEN WE HAVE THAT LIKE RIGHT TO ENFORCE. I THINK THE ONE THING THAT I HAVE HEARD MEMBERS- REPEATEDLY CONCERNED ABOUT. THAT WE HAVE AND GIVE MONEY TO CITIES COUNTIES AND SOME OF THAT MONEY IS GOING TO PLANNING AND NOT ACTUALLY BUILDING. THAT HOUSING AND SO THAT IS WHY WE NEED SOME SORT OF COMPORTMENT MAKE. MEN WHAT THAT IMPROVEMENT MECHANISM LIKE SAID WE STILL UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS. ALL THE DIFFERENT IS THE- WHAT IS THE- WHAT. THE ACTUAL PROPER AND MOST USEFUL AND MOST FUNCTIONAL ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM. THANK YOU MISTER MENTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN- JUST A FEW COMMENTS A LOT'S BEEN SAID SOME I'M NOT MECHANISM LINK IN THIS BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS- I- IT IS. VAGUE IN SOME SOME PLACES BUT I DON'T AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE SAY NEGATIVE AT THIS POINT- BECAUSE I DO THINK YOU NEED FLEXIBILITY- IN PARTICULAR I WANT TO GIVE YOU CREDIT BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN SOMEBODY AND IN MY TIME HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY THAT SHOWN THAT THEY CAN NEGOTIATE. WELL AND THAT TAKES CONSIDERATION A LOT OF- OPPOSING VIEWPOINTS ON THE ISSUE SO I DON'T VIEW YOUR YOU KNOW SOME SORT OF VAGUENESS TODAY- IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE YOU'RE THE AUTHOR AS NECESSARILY IN A BIG NEGATIVE- THIS COMING ALONG. YOU KNOW THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE. FOR ALL OF US HERE- THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD SAY TO IS WHILE I YOU KNOW I SORT OF HAD TO HAVE HAVE. TWO THOUGHTS ON. HOW WHAT KIND OF CHARACTERIZING THIS AS YOU KNOW THINK BIG. AS MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO SAID I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT BUT I ALSO SOMEBODY WHO HAS SPENT A SIGNIFICANT. PERSON IN OF. MY PROFESSIONAL CAREER WORKING WITH THE HOMELESS IN PARTICULAR THE CHRONIC HOMELESS. YEAH THERE'S ALSO PARTS OF THAT WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY THINK SMALL- BECAUSE IT IS SO COMPLICATED. A FOR TALKING ABOUT THE CHRONIC HOMELESS AT TO SINGLE THEM OUT FOR A MOMENT IS THERE THERE'S SO MUCH THAT GOES INTO THAT- IN TERMS OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE SUBSTANCE ABUSE- DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MEET YOU GO DOWN A LIST OF ISSUE AND BY THE WAY. THE PARTICULAR AMONG CLACKAMAS IT'S- IT'S OFTENTIMES MULTIPLE YES. AND SO IT IS VERY- COMPLICATED TO DEAL WITH THAT POPULATION WHEN WE WON AND IN MY PROGRAM WE GOT WE GOT THIRTY EIGHT HOUSE TO AS MR WHERE MEMBERS. KNOW IT THAT WAS A HUGE ACHIEVEMENT BECAUSE THOSE THIRTY EIGHT WERE SO COMPLICATED. AND BY THE WAY STILL AND HOUSING STILL DOING VERY WELL. SO I DIFFERENT ONES FOR THIS DAY I LIKE I ATE IN IOWA I CLEARLY LIKE THE OBJECTIVES I THINK IT'S GOT THIS IS ME CHALLENGE FOR YOU MOVE FOR BECAUSE WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO THINK BIG WHILE ALSO. KIND OF ATTACKING THESE DETAILS- THAT MAY SEEM SMALLER BETTER- BUT ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT- SO GOOD LUCK I'M HAPPY TO HELP HELP. WORK WITH YOU ON THIS AND HAVE INPUT. AND I LOOK FOR THIS CONTINUING DOWN THROUGH THE PROCESS THANK YOU. MISS EMMA. THANKS FOR BRINGING THIS FORTY THINK THAT IT'S AT WHILE IT'S A BEGINNING IT'S ALSO I BELIEVED IN WHAT THE INTENTION WAS WAS IT SHOULD GENERATE A REALLY SUBSTANTIVE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO- TO HELP- OUR COMMUNITIES TO HELP PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A HOME- A COUPLE THINGS AND THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED I WAS GONNA ASK IN MORE DETAIL ABOUT THE ACCOUNTABILITY BUT YOU'VE ALREADY RECEIVED A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT- AND LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MORE ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS I THINK THAT IT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR OUR COMMUNITIES- NOT ONLY TO HAVE A MEASURE OF ACCOUNTABILITY BUT ALSO THE TOOLS. AND TO THE TOOLS PIECE I ALSO I WANT TO BRING UP SOMETHING THAT A I THINK- I HOPE THAT THE TOOLS ARE APPLIED EQUITABLE THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE DO YOU- FOR EXAMPLE WHERE YOU LOOK AT BUDGET THE BUT IT WILL PULL YOU KNOW LOOK AT THIRTEEN BIG CITIES OF OUR STATE BUT IT TURNS OUT MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED OTHER CITIES DON'T LOOK THAT WAY WHO DON'T FUNCTION IN THAT SAME WAY AND I THINK FOR SERIOUS ABOUT TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM AT A STATEWIDE LEVEL. AT DOUBLE TOOLS AN EQUITABLE ACCOUNTABILITY AND THAT MIGHT LOOK DIFFERENT REGION TO REGION- AND EVERYONE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BUT I ALSO BELIEVE EVERYONE SHOULD- HAVE THE TOOLS THAT HELP THAT COMMUNITY- I REPRESENT BOTH YOU KNOW THE EIGHTEENTH LARGEST CITY. IN THE STATE LIKE OFFICE STAR IS VERY URBAN BUT ALSO RIVER YOU WILL NOT BE TO ADDRESS. EVERYONE TO SEE SOME OF THE DETAILS- AS THIS UNFOLDS SO THANK YOU THANK. WE'VE HEARD FROM ALMOST EVERYONE UNLESS OR ANY FINAL COMMENTS I WILL ASK THE AUTHOR TO MAKE A CLOSING STATEMENT ITHINK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS AND I THINK THAT I AGREE WITH EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM I DON'T THINK I HEARD ONE THAT I DIDN'T. AGREE WITH- WE ARE TRYING RIGHT NOW WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE BALANCE BETWEEN BEING FIRST RIGHT BECAUSE THERE IS SOME FLEX WE ARE CLOSE BILLION NOT JUST FOR THE DIFFERENT INSTANCES OF WHAT HOMELESS LOOKS LIKE AND HOW YOU GOT THERE BUT FOR THE- RENT CITIES- AND WHAT THEIR- MAKE UP AS AN INSTRUCTOR SO WE ARE TRYING TO FIND THAT EXACT BALANCE. A AND ARE VERY VERY AWARE AND CONSCIOUS. SO THAT. YOU CAN. BUT THAT BEING SAID WE ALL WE- WE GOVERNOR OVER THE FIFTH FLOOR. ON ME IN THE WORLD AND WE ARE ALWAYS CREEK QUICK TO BRAG ABOUT IT. AND QUICK TO POINT OUT THE CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER AND INNOVATOR BUT I'M NOT SURE HOW WE SAY THAT WITH PRIDE. WHEN WE ARE HOME TO SOME OF THE DEEPEST CHILD POVERTY AND THE NATION'S HIGHEST HOMELESS POPULATION. THIRTY FIVE ON SHELTER PEOPLE DIE EVERY DAY IN THE US AND THE ON HOUSE HAVE A LIFE EXPECTANCY THAT'S TWENTY FIVE YEARS LESS THAN THE AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL. ARE CALIFORNIA REPRESENTATIVES IN WASHINGTON DC ARE NOW STRUGGLING WITH LEADING FEDERALLY BECAUSE THEY SERVE UNDER THE SHADOW OF OUR SUFFERING MASSES. AS A STATE WE HAVE RALLIED AROUND THE RIGHT TO CLEAN WATER. AIR EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE. WE SET A CREST OF GHG REDUCTION GOALS AND WE HAVE BEEN GREAT SUCCESS IN ACHIEVING THOSE GOALS. HOW TO BE A CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE- READ AND RISEN TO OUR GREATEST CHALLENGES AND DO WHAT IS BEST FOR THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE. NOW IS THE TIME TO LIST THAT HOUSING IS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT IN CALIFORNIA. WE NEED TO DRAW VERY CLEAR AND REAL LINE IN THE SAND AND THE CLERK THAT CALIFORNIA WILL NO LONGER LEAD AND POVERTY OR NEGLECT. THAT WE STAND ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY AND PUBLISH A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO HOUSING I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN ITEM. WITH THAT KIND OF EMOTION MOVE THIS FORWARD. AND MOTION SECOND BY MISTER GLORIA WITH THAT MADAM SECRETARY. MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE AND APPROPRIATIONS CHU CHU I GAPE. BLOOM AYE BLOOM AYE GLORIA GLORIA I KILEY. LIMóN HI LIMóN I MAIENSCHEIN MAIENSCHEIN AYE QUIRK SILVA XLII. YOUR MEASURE HIS BEST OF THIS COMMITTEE SIX ZERO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR. AND WITH THAT LET US BRING UP OUR FINAL ITEM FILE ITEM TO AB SEVEN TWENTY FIVE AND I'LL JUST SIT COLLEAGUES- MS BROOKS BILL MISS WEEKES BILLS WERE TOO. LARGE BILLS AND I AGAIN APPRECIATE AS WE DID WITH THIS BURKE MISS WICKS FOR. THE INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WORK YOU DID IN THE RECESS TO ADDRESS ALL THE CONCERNS THAT ARE RIGHT SO WITH THAT THIS WEEK'S. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I WANT TO THANK COMMITTEE STAFF. THIS THIS WAS COMPLEX BUT I THINK WE WORK THROUGH IT- I WANT TO START OF ALSO BASING EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS- CALIFORNIA HAS A HOUSING PRODUCTION GOAL OF CREATING ROUGHLY THREE POINT FIVE MILLION NEW HOMES. HOUSING UNITS BY TWENTY FIVE AND HOW THE STATE ONLY HAS PLANS TO TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION. A METHOD TO EIGHT BY A SMALL SCALE IT'S A HOUSING POLICY EASING. PRESSURES WITHOUT HE DROPS THE CHIPS NEIGHBORHOOD. MODEST MORE. THAN LIKE PARKS ISN'T TRIPLEX QUAD LEX'S CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND BY. AND THIS REALLY I THINK REPRESENTS KIND OF A RETURN THIS MISSING MIDDLE HOUSING THAT USED TO BE SO POPULAR IN CALIFORNIA- FORTY FIFTY SIXTY YEARS AGO WE HAVEN'T BUILT ENOUGH OF THAT HOUSING RECENTLY. FOR EXAMPLE LOS ANGELES. PERCENT OF THE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES WERE REZONED A WHOLE JUST TO HOMES DUPLEXES. THE LOCAL HOUSING STOCK WOULD INCREASE BY SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND MORE UNITS. IN SAN FRANCISCO OF JUST 10% OF PARCELED OF PARCELS OWNED FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOMES A COMPANY TO UNITS. THERE IS HOUSING STOCK COULD GROW TO ALMOST 19% IN THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS. AB SEVEN TWENTY FIVE ENSURES THAT LAND IS ZONED FOR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING AND ABOVE MODERATE MODERATE INCOME COMMUNITIES. AGAIN I THINK THIS IS A- AN IMPORTANT PART OF HOW WE CAN INCREASE THE NECESSARY HOUSING SUPPLY THAT WE NEED TO. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON OUR HOMELESS ISSUES IN THE AFFORDABILITY ISSUES THAT MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE FACING. WITH ME I LISA MANTE REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA BE- HE'S GONNA PRESENT AS WELL AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE OFF ALL OF THE- OPPOSITION WITH WORK WITH THE STAFF AND OTHERS- SPONSORS SO THE BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION RIGHT NOW NEVER. ASKED ABOUT. YOUR WITNESS. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS LOSE MINDSET COME BEHALF O CALIFORNIA BE. I THINK IT'S A MEMBER WICKS COVER THE BILL VERY WELL. IT EXTENDS THE CURRENT DENSITY MINIMUMS IN HOUSING ELEMENT LAW TO MODERATE AND ABOVE MODERATE HOUSING- FOR AT LEAST 25% OF. THOSE SHARES THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS DO. I WE SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE- WE FEEL LIKE IT'S GOING TO MAKE- HIGHER DENSITY HOUSING AND HOUSING ITSELF EASIER TO BUILD IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA AS YOU ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA FACES A DRAMATIC HOUSING SHORTAGE THAT NEED TO BE RESOLVED BY MORE CONSTRUCTION WITH THAT. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU THERE ARE OTHER SUPPORTERS OF THE MEASURE. TONY WITH THE A CALIFORNIA PARDON ASSOCIATION WE'VE BEEN IN SUPPORT AND CONTINUED BE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MICHAEL GUNNING WITH C. B. I A WHILE WE'RE NOT IN SUPPORT WILL NO LONGER POSE AND I CERTAINLY WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING. WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THIS YEAR ON THESE IMPORTANT HOUSING ISSUES THANK YOU. LET ME ASK THERE'S ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. AND WITH THAT LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AS I SAIDAT THE OUTSET I WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR YOUR STAFF YOUR SPONSORS FOR ALL THE WORK YOU'VE DONE TO GET THE BILL TO THIS POINT I KNOW THERE WAS. SOME INITIAL POTENTIAL OPPOSITION TO A YOU REALLY WORK A LOT OF GOOD DETAILS- I'VE BEEN AS I THINK MANY OF US ON THIS COMMITTEE ARE BIG FANS OF MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING- WORKFORCE HOUSING- WE KNOW THAT WE NEED MEDIUM DENSITY HOUSING THAT THIS BILL WOULD FACILITATE AS A WAY TO PROVIDE HOUSING WITHOUT PUBLIC CITIES. I AND JUST PRINT THIS FOR OF WITH THAT HAVE. SUPPORT ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION. THANK YOU. AND I KNOW THAT OUR OFFICES HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATION ABOUT SOME OF THIS BUT I WANTED TO ASK IF YOU COULD SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TO THE CONFIGURATIONS FOR HIGH FIRES ON IN SOME OF THESE METROPOLITAN DESIGNATED AREAS- AND WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE. YEAH I'M CURRENTLY- THE BILLS THAT THE CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT QUALIFY FOR IT I THINK YOU'VE UNDER IF YOU SEE THOSE SEVEN OF THAT SO MANY AND IT SEEMED THE LIST AND I AND- I APPRECIATE YOU SAID CURRENTLY BECAUSE THAT COULD CHANGE- FOR CITIES I ALSO. A THINK THEIR SON QUESTION TWO I KNOW I HAVE SOME CITIES THAT ARE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND. THAT ARE NOT LISTED THERE AND SO. I THINK THE METROPOLITAN DESIGNATION I THINK IS. FLUID IT'S NOT STATIC RIGHT. YEAH AND I THINK THE GOAL IS TO. BUILD MORE HOMES. MORE DENSELY IN AND MORE DENSE COMMUNITIES RIGHT. WHICH TEND NOT TO BE IN THE FIRE ZONE ERICA'S. BUT THERE'S SOME SHINS I MEAN I CAN NAME. STREET SINCE IT IN CITIES THAT HAVE THAT WAS IT YEAH I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW YOU THINK ABOUT THAT YEAH I MEAN I'M HAPPY. CAN MAKE. CONVERSATIONS FOR SOME TIME IT WOULD HAVE. MAKE SURE. GUARDIANS THE- ISSUES GOING ABOUT THE DENSE TOMORROW BUILDING- YOU KNOW I GREW UP IN ED HI FIRES ON AREA AND THIS IS. WHAT IT. IS YOU OFTEN IN OUR COMMUNITY. OF GUARDING YOU SURE. COMMUNITY REPRESENT WHERE. THE CITY WILL HAVE A CERTAIN. PARTS OF THE COMMUNITY. JUST LOOK VERY DIFFERENT- YOU KNOW. THERE'S LIKE THE DOWNTOWN THAT LOOKS DIFFERENT THAN YOU KNOW ANOTHER NEIGHBORHOOD. AND IN PARTICULAR I WORRY ABOUT THE COMMUNITIES WHERE. THEY ARE HIGH FIRES UP- AND THE- ROADS LIKE THERE'S REALLY NARROWS AGAIN IN AN ALKALINE. ARE NOT ALWAYS THE PRESS. BUT TO PUT HOUSE AND SO I'M JUST TRYING TO AND I THINK I'M AND USING THIS BILL GIVES AND YOU SHOULD OF STUCK THIS TOO BUT I THINK SOME FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE JUST IT SAYS THAT ALLOWS FOR TWENTY PERCENT. BE CONSIDERED FIRST MULTI DOESN'T REQUIRE IT AND IT DOESN'T SAY WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO I THINK IT GIVES FLEXIBILITY FOR LOCAL COMMITTEES CAN IF YOU'RE TAKING THOSE. INTO ACCOUNT HE DIED. THERE IS SOMEONE. ABOUT A FLEXIBILITY. THE BILL WILL TALKING. THING HOUSING ELEMENT LAW THAT REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS A PART OF THEIR GENERAL PLAN IS NOW. TO SPECIFY WHERE THIS IS GOING TO ARE GOING TO GO THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BEST RESPOND TO THOSE. NEEDS SO WE DON'T THINK THIS BILL IS GOING TO HAVE. ANY ADVERSE PACKED UP THEIR BILL. ADEQUATELY PLAN THAT. INCLUDED FOR HIGH. THAT'S OUR- MEETING THE GOALS TO MAKE IT FLEXIBLE NOT PRESCRIPTIVE. BUT STILL ENSURING YOU HAVE THE BILL. THE FAMILY HOUSING WHERE IT WHERE IT MAKES SENSE IN THE COMMUNITY. ANY FINAL COMMENTS WITH THAT AS WELL COMMENTS WITH RESPECT FAST FOR AN AYE VOTE WITH AS A MOTION MOVE THIS FORWARD.
