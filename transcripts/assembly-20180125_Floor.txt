BUT THE GRATEFUL DEAD THE ONLY A AN EX MAYOR. OF SAN FRANCISCO POSSIBLY GET AWAY WITH THAT. NOT WHO I THINK SAID SOMETHING THAT REALLY PERSONIFIES THIS HISTORIC MOMENT HE SAID YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THE BEST OF THE BEST. YOU WANT TO BE THE ONLY ONE. THAT DOES WHAT YOU DO. I THINK THAT'S A WONDERFUL WAY. OF DESCRIBING. OUR GOVERNOR. SO IT'S IN THAT SPIRIT. THIS HISTORIC MOMENT. IN OUR STATE. AND IN THE LIFE OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY MAN THAT I'M PROUD TO INTRODUCE TO YOU THE ONE. THE ONLY SU WEEKENDS. GOVERNOR EDMUND G. BROWN JR WELL. AS MY FATHER USED TO SAY. I ACCEPT THE NOMINATION I'M HERE REPORT PUT. CALIFORNIA IS PROSPERING. WELL IT FACES CHAIR OF DIFFICULTIES WE SHOULD NEVER FORGET THE BONY AND AND THE ENDLESS OPPORTUNITIES BESTOWED ON THIS SPECIAL PLACE OR THE DISTANCE WE'VE ALL TRAVEL THESE LAST FEW YEARS. HAS NO HARD TO VISUALIZE OR EVEN REMEMBER. THE HARDSHIPS THE BANKRUPTCIES IN THE HOME FORECLOSURES SO MANY EXPERIENCE DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. UNEMPLOYMENT WAS ABOVE TWELVE PERCENT. AND ONE POINT THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS LOST THEIR JOBS. THE DEFICIT WAS TWENTY SEVEN BILLION IN TWENTY ELEVEN. THE NEW YORK TIMES. THEY CALL THIS THE COAST OF DYSTOPIA. THE WALLSTREET JOURNAL SAW THE GREAT CALIFORNIA EXES. THE ECONOMIST THE LONDON PRONOUNCED US. THE UNGOVERNABLE STATE. IN THE BUSINESS INSIDER SIMPLY SAID. CALIFORNIA IS DOOMED. EVEN TODAY YOU'LL FIND CRITICS WHO PLAY WHO CLAIM THE CALIFORNIA DREAM IS DEAD. BUT I'M USED TO THAT BACK IN MY FIRST TERM A PRESTIGIOUS SUPPORT SOLIS THE CALIFORNIA THE WORST BUSINESS CLIMATE IN AMERICA. IN POINT OF FACT PERSONAL INCOME IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE MY FIRST YEAR AS GOVERNOR WAS ONE HUNDRED. AND FIFTY FOUR BILLION. TODAY IT IS GROWN TO TWO POINT FOUR TRILLION. IN JUST THE LAST EIGHT YEARS ALONE CALIFORNIA'S PERSONAL INCOME HAS GROWN EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE BILLION. AND TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION NEW JOBS HAVE BEEN CREATED. VERY WELL WORLD CAN MATCH THAT GROWTH. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY CONFIDENCE IN THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING HAS RISEN SO HIGH. THAT CONTRAST SHARPLY WITH THE ABYSMAL APPROVAL RATINGS GIVEN TO THE U. S. CONGRESS. CERTAINLY OUR ON TIME BUDGET SO WELL RECEIVED THANKS IN LARGE PART TO LOWERING THE TWO THIRDS VOTE TO A SIMPLE MAJORITY TO PASS THE BUDGET. BUT PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IS ALSO BUT INSPIRED BY YOUR PASSING WITH BOTH REPUBLICANS IN DEMOCRATIC VOTES. PENSION REFORM. I DON'T MINIMIZE THAT THAT WAS A BIG PENSION REFORM MAY NOT BE THE FINAL ONE BUT IT WAS THERE AND YOU DID REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS. YEAH WHOSE COMPENSATION REFORM ANOTHER VOTE WITH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS THERE THE WATER BOND. THE RAINY DAY FUND AND THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. AND BY THE WAY. YOU REPUBLICANS AS I LOOK OVER HERE LOOK OVER THERE DON'T WORRY. I GOT YOUR BACK. ALL OUR BIG ALL THESE PROGRAMS A BIG A VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR FUTURE AND THERE PASSAGE DEMONSTRATES THAT SOME AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS ACTUALLY CAN GET STUFF DONE. EVEN IN THE FACE OF DEEPENING PARTISAN DIVISION. THE RECENT FIRES A MUD SLIDE SHOWS HOW MUCH WE'RE ALL AFFECTED BY NATURAL DISASTERS AND HOW WE CAN RISE TO THE OCCASION. THE LOCAL LEVEL THE STATE LEVEL IT WITH MAJOR HELP FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I WANT TO ESPECIALLY THANK ALL THE FIREFIGHTERS THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND THE VOLUNTEERS THESE GREAT MEN AND WOMEN IT'S THE GOAL TILT THEIR FELLOW NEIGHBORS SOME CASES EVEN WHEN THEIR OWN OWN HOMES WERE BURNING. THERE WE SEE AN EXAMPLE OF PEOPLE WORKING TOGETHER IRRESPECTIVE OF PARTY. PRESIDENT SELFLESS GIVING CALIFORNIA SUBSTANTIAL ASSISTANCE AND THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP IS NOW SPONSORING LEGISLATION HELP CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS THE OTHER STATES HAVE SUFFERED MAJOR DISASTERS TEXAS FLORIDA. AND THE COMMONWEALTH REPORTER RICO. IN THIS REGARD. WE SHOULD NEVER FORGET OUR DEPENDENCE ON THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. AND THE FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES IT PRESENTS TO THE WAY WE LIVE. WE CAN'T FIGHT NATURE WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO GET ALONG WITH HER I WANNA SAY THAT AGAIN WE CAN'T FIGHT NATURE WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO GET ALONG WITH. AND THAT'S NOT SO EASY FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS THIS LAND NOW CALL CALIFORNIA SUPPORTED NO MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. THAT'S THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. AND THEY DID THAT FOR THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS SOME PEOPLE SAY AS LONG AS TWENTY THOUSAND YEARS TODAY FORTY MILLION PEOPLE LIVE IN THE SAME PLACE. AND THE SHEER IMPACT ON THE SOILS THE FORESTS AND THE ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM HAS NO LONG TERM PRESIDENT. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO INNOVATE CONSTANTLY AND CREATE ALL MANNER OF SHELTER MACHINES A CREATIVE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL CONTINUE. BUT ONLY WITH EVER GREATER PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT. THE DEVASTATING FOREST FIRES IN THE MUD SLIDES ARE PROFOUND AND GROWING CHALLENGE. EIGHT OF THE STATE'S MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRES HAVE OCCURRED. IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. LAST YEAR'S THOMAS FIRE IN THE TOUR AND SANTA BARBARA COUNTIES WAS THE LOOK OF THE LAW LARGEST IN RECORDED HISTORY. THE MUD SLIDES THAT FOLLOWED WERE AMONG THE MOST LETHAL THIS STATE HAS EVER ENCOUNTERED. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE HAD THE HIGHEST AVERAGE SUMMER TEMPERATURES IN RECORDED HISTORY. OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS CALIFORNIA'S FIRE SEASON HAS INCREASED SEVENTY EIGHT DAYS IN SOME PLACES. NEARLY YEAR ROUND. SO YOU HAVE TO BE READY WITH THE NECESSARY FIRE FIGHTING CAPABILITY AND THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS TO WARN RESIDENTS OF IMPENDING DANGER. WE ALSO HAVE TO MANAGE OUR FORESTS AND OUR SOILS MUCH MORE INTELLIGENTLY TOWARD THAT END ALL CONVENE A TASK FORCE. COMPOSED OF SCIENTISTS AND KNOWLEDGEABLE FOURS PRACTITIONERS TO YOU THOROUGHLY THE WAY OUR FORESTS ARE MANAGED. AND SUGGEST WAYS TO REDUCE THE THREAT. A DEVASTATING FIRES. THEY'LL ALSO CONSIDER HOW CALIFORNIA CAN INCREASE RESILIENCY IN CARBON STORAGE CAPACITY. TREES IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD ABSORB CO TWO NOT GENERATE HUGE AMOUNTS OF BLACK CARBON AND GREENHOUSE GASES HE DO TODAY WHEN FOREST FIRE RAGES ACROSS THE LAND. DESPITE WHAT IS WIDELY BELIEVED BY SOME OF THE MOST POWERFUL PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON. THE SCIENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT IN DOUBT. THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF SCIENCE OF EVERY MAJOR COUNTRY THE WORLD INCLUDING RUSSIA AND CHINA. HAVE ALL ENDORSED THE MAINSTREAM VIEW THE HUMAN BECAUSE GREENHOUSE GASES ARE TRAPPING HEAT. IN THE OCEANS AND THE ATMOSPHERE AND THE ACTION MUST BE TAKEN TO AVERT CATASTROPHIC CHANGES AND AWAITING SYSTEMS. ALL NATIONS AGREE EXCEPT ONE. AND THAT IS SOLELY BECAUSE A ONE MAN. OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT. HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE FOLLOW A DIFFERENT PATH IN LIFE BY TOP SCIENTISTS AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA STANFORD AND CAL TECH. AMONG OTHERS OUR STATE HAS LED THE WAY. NUMEROUS JUST TELL BUILDING APPLIANCE EFFICIENCY STANDARDS RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY REACHING FIFTY PERCENT IN JUST A FEW YEARS. A POWERFUL LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD. INCENTIVES FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. AMBITIOUS POLICIES TO RETORT WRIST REDUCE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS LIKE METHANE AND BLACK CARBON. A UN SPONSORED CLIMATE SUMMIT THIS SEPTEMBER IN SEVEN CISCO AND THE NATION'S ONLY FUNCTIONING AND COMPREHENSIVE CAP AND TRADE SYSTEM. I'LL SURELY PROVIDE AN EXPENDITURE PLAN FOR THE REVENUES THAT THE CAP AND TRADE AUCTIONS AND GENERATE. YOU'RE RENEWING THIS PROGRAM ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS WAS A MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT AND WILL ENSURE THAT WE WILL HAVE SUBSTANTIAL SUMS TO INVEST IN COMMUNITIES ALL ACROSS THE STREET. BOTH URBAN AND AGRICULTURAL. THE GOAL IS. THE GOAL IS TO MAKE OUR NEIGHBORHOODS IN FORUMS HEALTHIER OUR VEHICLES CLEANER ZERO MISSION THE SOONER THE BETTER. AND ALL OUR TECHNOLOGIES INCREASINGLY LOWERING THEIR CARBON OUTPUT. TO MEET THESE AMBITIOUS GOALS WILL NEED FIVE MILLION ZERO EMISSION GOAL VEHICLE EMISSION VEHICLES ON THE ROAD BY TWENTY THIRTY AND WE'RE GONNA GET THERE. BELIEVE WE'LL HAVE THREE AND FIFTY THOUSAND TODAY SO WE ALL GOT A LOT OF WORK. AND. OKAY. THE BILL OF THE JOBS AND IT'S CLEANER OR RURAL BE THEN. WHEN YOU PASS THE CAP AND TRADE LEGISLATION YOU ALSO PASSED. THE FAR REACHING AIR POLLUTION MEASURE THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME FOCUSES ON POLLUTANTS THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT SPECIFIC NEIGHBORHOODS INSTEAD OF JUST MEASURING POLLUTANTS OVER VAST SWATHS IRWIN. REGULATORS WILL ZERO IN ON THOSE COMMUNITIES WHICH A PARTICULAR DISADVANTAGE Y. TRAINS TRUCKS OR FACTORIES. MOON WITH CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER IS A FUNDAMENTAL GOOD THE MUST BE PROTECTED AND MADE AVAILABLE ON A SUSTAINABLE BASIS. WHEN DROUGHT SICKER CONSERVATION MEASURES BECOME IMPAIRED. IN RECENT YEARS YOU'VE PASSED HISTORIC LEGISLATION TO MANAGE CALIFORNIA'S GROUNDWATER WHICH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE NOW IMPLEMENTING. IT ADDITION YOU PASSED IN MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF THE VOTERS APPROVED A WATER BOND THAT INVESTS IN SAFE DRINKING WATER CONSERVATION AND STORAGE. AS A RESULT WILL SOON BEGIN EXPANDING FUN FUNDS ON SOME OF THE STORAGE WE'VE NEEDED FOR DECADES. WHAT IS THE CLIMATE CHANGES AND MORE WATER ARRIVES AS RAIN? STILL THE SNOW. CRUCIAL THE REAL THE CATCH OF THE CAPTION THE OVERFLOW A TIMELY AND RESPONSIBLE WAY. THAT TOGETHER WITH THE RECYCLING AND RAIN WATER RECAPTURE WILL PUT US IN THE BEST POSITION TO USE WATER WISELY. AND THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY POSSIBLE. WERE ALSO RESTORING THE SACRAMENTO AND SAN JOAQUIN WATERSHEDS PROTECT WATER SUPPLIES IMPROVES CALIFORNIA'S OUR A CLINIC SALMON RUNS. FINALLY. ONLY WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA WATER FIX ALONG STUDY IT CAREFULLY DESIGNED PROJECT TO MODERNIZE OUR BROKEN WATER SYSTEM. I'M CONVINCED THAT WILL CONSERVE WATER PROTECT THE FISH. AND THE HABITAT MEDILL TO INSURE THE DELIVERY A BADLY NEED WATER TO THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO DEPEND ON CALIFORNIA'S ACTOR DUCKS. LOCAL WATER DISTRICTS IN BOTH THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH ARE PROVIDING THE LEADERSHIP IN THE FINANCING. BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT'S VITAL FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES AND FOR THE WHOLE STATE THAT'S TRUE THAT'S WHY. AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY I PERSIST. OUR CURRENT ME. THE SIXTH LARGEST IN THE WORLD DEPENDS ON MOBILITY. WHICH ONLY A MODERN AND EFFICIENT TRANSPORTATION TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM PROVIDES. THE VOTE ON THE GAS TAX WAS NOT EASY. BUT IT WAS ESSENTIAL GIVEN THE VAST NETWORK IN ROADS AND BRIDGES WHICH CALIFORNIA DEPENDS. AND THE ESTIMATED SIXTY SEVEN BILLION IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. TENS OF MILLIONS OF CARS AND TRUCKS TRAVEL OVER THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION MILES A YEAR. THE SUN'S ONLY NINETY THREE MILLION MILES AWAY. THE FUNDS THIS BE ONE MAKES AVAILABLE ARE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY IF WE'RE GOING TO MAINTAIN OUR ROADS AND TRANSIT SYSTEMS IN GOOD REPAIR. TWENTY FIVE OTHER STATES HAVE REYES GAS TAXES EVEN THE U. S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THIS GOAL FOR FEDERAL GAS TAX. BECAUSE THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND IS NEARLY BROKE. GOVERNMENT DOES WOULD INDIVIDUALS CARE TO LIKE BUILD ROADS AND BRIDGES AND SUPPORT LOCAL BUS. AND LIGHT RAIL SYSTEMS. THIS IS OUR COMMON IN DENVER. BUT WHICH WE POOL OUR RESOURCES THROUGH THE PUBLIC SECTOR IMPROVE ALL OF OUR LIVES. FOR ANY GAS TAX MAY APPEAR TO BE GOOD POLITICS. BUT IT IS. I WILL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO DEFEAT ANY REPEAL EFFORT THE GETS ON THE BALLOT YOU LOOK. LOOKING FOR THAT ONE REPUBLICAN. BRAVE UPGRADE. ALRIGHT SINCE I TALKED ABOUT TOTALS IN TRANSPORTATION I'LL BRING UP ONE MORE ITEM OF INTEREST. HIGH SPEED RAIL. LARA. I MAKE NO BONES ABOUT IT. I LIKE TRAINS I LIKE HIGH SPEED TRAINS EVEN BETTER. SO DO THE VOTERS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN THEY APPROVE THE BOND LOOK. ELEVEN OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE HIGH SPEED TRAINS THEY'RE NOT TAKEN FOR GRANTED ALL OVER EUROPE IN JAPAN AND IN CHINA. PRESIDENT REAGAN HIMSELF SAID IN JAPAN ON NOVEMBER ELEVENTH NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE. THE FOLLOWING I QUOTE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS PLANNING TO BUILD THE RAPID SPEED TRAIN THAT IS ADAPTED FROM YOUR HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL POETRY. YES WE WORK AND NOW WE ARE ACTUALLY BUILDING. TAKES A LONG TIME. WELL AGAIN THE BIG PROJECT THEIR OBSTACLES THERE WERE FOR THE BAY AREA RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEM FOR THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE IN THE PANAMA CANAL. A PASSOVER IN SILENCE THE TIME IT TOOK TO BUILD THE THE BAY AREA BRIDGE THAT WAS ALMOST TWENTY YEARS. AND BY THE WAY WAS OVER BUDGET BY. SIX BILLION DOLLARS. WELL ONE BILLION DOLLAR PROJECT. SO THAT HAPPENS. BUT KNOW THE HIGH SPEED RAIL WE GOT THAT WOULD COVER. BUT BUILDING TODAY DID PULL THOSE PROJECTS A BILL THAT WE WILL AMERICA'S FIRST HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM. ONE LINK BETWEEN CITIZENS HIM CISCO AND ELECTRIFY CALTRAIN IS FINANCE AND READY TO GO. ANOTHER BILLION WITH MATCHING FUNDS WILL BE INVEST IN LOS ANGELES TO IMPROVE UNION STATION AS A MAJOR TRANSPORTATION HUB AND FIX THE ANAHEIM CORD. CLINICS THERE IS COMPLETING THE BALLOT SEGMENT AND GETTING OPERATING SYSTEM CONNECTED TO SAN JOSE YES ACOSTA LOT OF MONEY BUT IT'S STILL CHEAPER AND MORE CONVENIENT THAN EXPANDING AIRPORTS WHICH NOBODY WANTS TO DO. AND BUILDING NEW FREEWAYS. WHICH LANDOWNERS OFTEN OBJECTTO ALL THAT IS TO MEET THE GROWING DEMAND. WILL BE FAST THAT ICE ME REAL BE FAST AND BE QUIET YOU'D BE POWERED BY RULE ELECTRICITY AND BEST OF ALL IN THE LAST FOUR HUNDRED YEARS. AFTER ALL YOU GUYS ARE GONE. WARRANTED MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED CONSTRUCTION WORKERS OR ON THE JOB AT SEVENTEEN SITES AND HUNDREDS OF CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES ARE PROVIDING SERVICES GENERATING THOUSANDS OF JOB YEARS OF EMPLOYMENT. AS THE GLOBAL ECONOMY PUTS MORE AMERICANS OUT OF WORK AND LOWERS WAGES INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS LIKE THIS WILL BE A KEY SOURCE. A WELL PAID CALIFORNIA JOBS. DIFFICULTIES CHALLENGES. WHERE THEY GET DISCOURAGED OR STOP US WHETHER IT'S ROADS OR TRAINS OR DAMS OR RENEWABLE ENERGY INSTALLATIONS OR ZERO EMISSION CARS? CALIFORNIA IS SETTING THE PACE FOR THE ENTIRE NATION. YEAH YES THEIR CRITICS THEIR LAWSUITS LOTS OF THEM. AND THERE COUNTLESS OBSTACLES BUT CALIFORNIA WAS BUILT ON DREAMS AND PERSEVERANCE AND THE BOULDER PATH IS STILL OUR WAY FORWARD. MUSICIAN DO INFRASTRUCTURE IN PHYSICAL INVESTMENTS CALIFORNIA SPENDS HUGE SUMS FIRST SERVICES WHICH OF. THE FACT PEOPLE DIRECTLY SUCH AS EDUCATION HEALTHCARE AND OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. IN EDUCATION. THAT TO SINK THIRTY THOUSAND TEACHERS LAID OFF SPENDING HAS DRAMATICALLY RECOVERED. INCREASING BY FORTY SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS PER STUDENT THIRTY ONE BILLION OVERALL. WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO COMPLETELY FUND THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WHICH DIRECTS MONEY. TO THOSE SCHOOLS WITH THE GREATEST CHALLENGES. FOR DECADES. SCHOOL DISTRICT HAD WIDELY DISPARATE FUNDING INTO THE SERRANO AGAINST PRIEST DECISION MANDATED EQUAL FUNDING FOR ALL CHILDREN. NOW WITH OUR CURRENT FORMULA THE MOST DISADVANTAGED DISTRICTS WILL GET SUBSTANTIALLY MORE NOT JUST EQUAL FUNDING. IMPORTANTLY THIS YEAR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TO LINK SPENDING. WITH A LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS SO THAT PARENTS CAN SEE HOW THE ADDITIONAL SPENDING SUPPORTS ENGLISH LEARNERS AND STUDENTS FROM LOW INCOME FROM FAMILIES. BUT IT'S NO SECRET THE KIDS FROM MORE PRIVILEGED BACKGROUNDS GENERALLY DO BETTER ON STANDARDIZED TESTS. BUT THE ANSWER IS NOT MORE MICRO MANAGEMENT WITH INTRUSIVE STATE LAWS LEARNING TAKES PLACE IN THE CLASSROOM. AND THAT'S WHY OUR FIRST JOB IS TO SUPPORT TEACHERS AND GIVEN THE TRAINING AND THE FREEDOM TO TEACH BECAUSE THEY KNOW BETTER RESPECT TO HIGHER EDUCATION. CLEAR HOW MUCH OF OUR PROSPERITY DEPENDS ON THE INTELLECTUAL CONTRIBUTIONS OR IN SOME. IS OF HIGHER LEARNING. NATIONAL LEADERS. COME FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD TO VISIT CALIFORNIA'S MOST INNOVATIVE COMPANIES COMPANIES THEY'RE FILLED. WITH HIGHLY EDUCATED AND CREATIVE MEN WOMEN. MANY OF WHOM GRADUATED FOR A PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. ALTHOUGH IS ALWAYS A STRUGGLE FOR FUNDS. I WANT TO POINT OUT THIS IS% TWENTY ELEVEN THE STATE HAS INCREASED ITS ANNUAL SUPPORT OF HIGHER EDUCATION. BY FIVE POINT EIGHT BILLION. THAT'S ON INYO BASIS FROM NOW ON. THAT IS ONE POINT TWO BILLION FOR YOU SEE. ONE POINT SIX BILLION FOR CS YOU TWO POINT FOUR BILLION FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND SIX SEVEN TWENTY THREE MILLION ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL AID. BUT. NEXT GO JUMP G.. FIVE POINT EIGHT BILLION. HE WAS SO MANY OF ARE STUDENTS ATTENDINGCOLLEGE THERE'S STILL TWO AND A HALF MILLION CALIFORNIANS BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY FOUR WHO ARE IN THE WORKFORCE BUT LACKED. A POST SECONDARY DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE. THESE MEN AND WOMEN OFTEN GO OUT OF STATE AND PAY HIGH TUITION AT FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS TO IMPROVE THEIR SKILLS EMPLOYABILITY. FOR THIS GROUP. I WANT TO CREATE. THE CALIFORNIA ONLINE COLLEGE SO THESE OVERLOOKED CALIFORNIANS CAN GET THE TRAINING THEY NEED CONVENIENTLY AT A VERY LOW COST. YOU CAN APPLAUD THAT I'M. IN THIS ONE. WE SOON COMPETE WITH BRICKS AND MORTAR SCHOOLS OR THE EXISTING COMMUNITY COLLEGES OR YOU SEE ARE YOU S. C. FIZBER PEOPLE OUT OF THE WORKFORCE WEB NO THE WAY. THAT WE WANT TO BRING IT RIGHT TO THEIR HOMES SO THEY CAN GET HERE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH CARE. WHEN IT COMES BILL CARE HELD A CALIFORNIA'S BOLDLY EMBRACE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BUT IN RULING FIVE MILLION MORE PEOPLE INTO A MEDICAL PROGRAM AND ONE POINT THREE MILLION INTO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH EXCHANGE. COVERED CALIFORNIA. THESE ARE FAR REACHING. THESE THESE ARE REALLY FAR REACHING MOVES WATER LARGELY DEPENDED ON TENS OF BILLIONS OF FEDERAL DOLLARS. THE WOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY BY THE CONGRESS AND THE EFFORT TO REPEAL AND REPLACE SUCCEEDED. THANK GOD FOR JOHN MCCAIN. LISA MURKOWSKI AND SUSAN COLLINS ALONG WITH THE DEMOCRATS THEY PREVAILED AND PROJECTED THE HEALTH CARE FOR TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. WILLINGLY. OWN TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY. NOTHING IS MORE IN FUNDAMENTAL. THEN IN A BITING SENSE ON THE PART OF PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN ENJOY THEIR LIVES SAFE AND SECURE. FREE FROM CRIME. GOOD NEIGHBORHOODS GOOD SCHOOLS AND GOOD JOBS ALL CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTHY AND SAFE COMMUNITIES BUT THERE STILL IS CRIME. LOTS OF IT IN MANY CASES QUITE SERIOUS. TO COMBAT CRIME AMONG OTHER THINGS CALIFORNIA'S CREATED AN EXTENSIVE PRISON SYSTEM THAT IS CHANGE QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY AND GROWN OVER THE DECADES. IN FACT HE GREW SO FAST IT BECAME SO CROWDED THAT UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT ISSUED AN UNPRECEDENTED ORDER REQUIRING DRASTIC CHANGES. DID GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE MAGNITUDE THE PROBLEM. HERE'S SOME OF THE FACTS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY. CALIFORNIA PRISON ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVEPERSONS PRODUCE THOUSAND. THAT NUMBER NOW STANDS AT THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE. THE CORRECTIONS BUDGET THEN WAS ABOUT THREE PERCENT. OF THE GENERAL FUND NOTES  <u><c.green>POINT</c></u> NINE PERCENT ABOUT TWELVE BILLION. YET LAST YEAR THE NUMBER OF REPORTED FELONIES WAS ACTUALLY LOWER THAN IT WAS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY. IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE THE CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE HEADED BUT. TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND WORDS. I ACTUALLY GOT TO PEOPLE ACCOUNT. TODAY THAT NUMBER HAS GROWN TO ONE POINT TWO MILLION. BY COMPARISON. THE TEN COMMANDMENTS RUN JUST UNDER THREE HUNDRED WORDS. ONLY TEN COMMANDMENTS IS STILL TEN. IN CALIFORNIA THERE MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND SEPARATE CRIMINAL PROVISIONS SO US ONE WHAT IS CRIMINAL WHAT THE PENALTY SHOULD BE. WHAT ENHANCEMENT SHOULD BE ADDED AND WHAT CREDITS MIGHT BE BR? MUCH OF THIS HAS CHANGED. I'D SAY CHANGE OVER OVER AGAIN AND TURNED OVER THE DECADES AS THE LEGISLATURE IS INACTIVE ENLIST NEW CRIME LAWS AND THE VOTERS HAVE APPROVED ONE BALLOT MEASURE AFTER ANOTHER. USUALLY BUT NOT ALWAYS ADDING MORE TIME IN PRISON. MY PLEA IS RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD TAKE TIME TO UNDERSTAND OUR SYSTEM A CRIME AND PUNISHMENT HAS INVOLVED HOW OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES HAVE DEVISED THEIR PRISON SYSTEM. AND WHAT CHANGES MIGHT WE KNOW ME. I URGE INSTEAD OF ENACTING NEW LAWS BECAUSE A HORRIBLE CRIMES AND LURID HEADLINES YOU CONSIDER THE OVERALL SYSTEM. AND WHAT IT MIGHT NEED A WHAT TRULY PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY. CERTAINLY WE NEED MORE MENTAL HEALTH AND DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAMS. AND BETTER TRAINED. IMAGES. THOSE WERE GETTING. WHAT MORE IS NEEDED? PARTICULARLY HOPE. OPENS YOU KNOW IS ONE OF THE THEOLOGICAL VIRTUES ALONG WITH FAITH AND CHARITY. ONE HUMAN BEING GETS A TWENTY OR FORTY YEAR SENTENCE AS TENS OF THOUSANDS DO INCENTIVES TO REFORM WEAKENED. AND HOPELESSNESS AND VIOLENCE TAKEOVER MAKING PRISON GANG INFLUENCE ALL THE MORE POWERFUL. THAT'S WHY RECENT MEASURES ARE SO VITAL WHICH ALLOW THE POSSIBILITY IN ONLY THE POSSIBILITY OF EARLIER PAROLE AND MILESTONE CREDITS FOR THOSE WHO TURN THEIR LIVES AROUND. EQUALLY IMPORTANT OR THE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS WHO WALKED THE HALLS IT PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH ALL MANNER OF IN ME. THEIR JOB IS TO KEEP THE PLACE SAFE. NEVER AN EASY TASK. INTEGRATE IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF RESPECT IN ORDER IN FOSTER A SPIRITED REHABILITATION WHENEVER POSSIBLE. THERE THOUSAND OTHERS WHO WORK IN THE PRISONS WHO ALSO DESERVE OUR SUPPORT. IT'S ALL OUT OF SIGHT. BUT PROFOUNDLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE INMATES WILL BE RETURNING TO THEIR COMMUNITIES MOST A MORAL. AND WE WANT THEM TO BE AS REFORM AND REHABILITATED AS POSSIBLE. FOR THE REST. TWO IS MUCH WE CAN DO TOGETHER BEFORE THIS YEAR ENDS. AND THESE ARE TRULY EXCITING TIMES FULL OF POSSIBILITIES. BUT ALSO FULL OF DANGER JUST THIS MORNING. THE PREEMINENT SCIENCE AND SECURITY BOARD OF THE BULLETIN OF THE ATOMIC SCIENTISTS MOVE THE MINUTE HAND OF THE DOOMSDAY CLOCK THIRTY SECONDS CLOSER. TO CATASTROPHE IS NOW TWO MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT AS CLOSE AND IT WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF THE COLD WAR IN NINETEEN FIFTY THREE. OUR WORLD. OUR WAY OF LIFE. OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNANCE OR ARE AN IMMEDIATE AND GENUINE RISK. ANALYST NEW WEAPONS SYSTEMS GROWING ANTAGONISM AMONG NATIONS THE POISON IN OUR POLITICS CLIMATE CHANGE. ALL OF THE SCHOOLS OUT FOR COURAGE FOR IMAGINATION. AND FOR GENEROUS DIALOGUE. IN RECENT DAYS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS TOOK TO THE STREETS THE CITIES ACROSS AMERICA TO PURCHASE A PLATE IN THE WOMAN'S MARCH. AT THE SAME TIME ACTIVISTS CHAMPION THE CAUSE OF THE NATION'S CAPITAL OF THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE WE CALL THE DREAMERS. AND ALL THIS CALIFORNIA WAS IN THE FOREFRONT SHOWING THE WAY. BUT THERE'S MUCH MORE TO DO. MUCH MORE TO DO ALL OF US WHATEVER OUR PARTY OR PHILOSOPHY A RULE TO PLAY. IN DEFINING AND ADVANCING OUR DEMOCRACY. OUR FOREBEARS SET THE EXAMPLE IS YOU MAY KNOW MY OWN GREAT GRANDFATHER ALL YOU SHUFFLING IN EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE SAILED TO AMERICA ON A SHIP. NAME PERSEVERANCE HE PERSISTED AGAINST ALL THE ODDS AND MADE TO SACRAMENTO THREE YEARS LATER. AND YES. WE TOO WILL PERSIST BEGINS STORMS IN TURMOIL OBSTACLES DRAYTON SMALL. THE SPIRIT OF DEMOCRACY NEVER DIES IT'S ALIVE IN THIS CHAMBER IN THE HEARTS OF CALIFORNIANS IN PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. LET THIS BE A GREAT YEAR FOR CALIFORNIA FOR OUR NATION AND FOR OUR FUTURE.
