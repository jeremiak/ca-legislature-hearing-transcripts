BECAUSE THEY'RE SIMILAR AMOUNTS

00:33:14.859 --> 00:33:16.327
YOU GO DOWN TO THE RESERVES AND

00:33:16.394 --> 00:33:18.596
IS THE CHAIR NOTED ALL THREE THE

00:33:18.663 --> 00:33:19.831
ADMINISTRATION IN BOTH HOUSES

00:33:19.897 --> 00:33:21.866
HAVE RESERVE LEVELS THAT ARE

00:33:21.933 --> 00:33:23.401
OVER SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS.

00:33:23.468 --> 00:33:24.369
THE SENATE HAS ACTUALLY

00:33:24.435 --> 00:33:26.437
INCREASED RESERVES.

00:33:26.504 --> 00:33:27.205
THEY HAVE USED.

00:33:27.271 --> 00:33:29.240
I KNEW RESERVE THAT THEY AS A

00:33:29.307 --> 00:33:31.409
SAFETY NET RESERVE THAT'S NOT IN

00:33:31.476 --> 00:33:32.810
MONIES THAT ARE IN THE BSA

00:33:32.877 --> 00:33:35.346
THEY'RE NOT IN EFFECT PROTECTED

00:33:35.413 --> 00:33:36.481
UNDER THE RULES OF PROPOSITION

00:33:36.547 --> 00:33:38.015
TWO. BUT THEY ARE UP OUR

00:33:38.082 --> 00:33:39.450
UNDERSTANDING IS THE INTENT IS

00:33:39.517 --> 00:33:40.318
TO SET THOSE ASIDE AND THEY

00:33:40.385 --> 00:33:42.320
WOULD BE USED. IN IN SIMILAR

00:33:42.387 --> 00:33:43.721
FASHION AS OTHER RESERVES.

00:33:43.788 --> 00:33:45.590
TARGETED TOWARDS SHORTFALLS IN

00:33:45.656 --> 00:33:46.624
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

00:33:46.691 --> 00:33:48.559
PROGRAMS IN THE FUTURE BUT IT IS

00:33:48.626 --> 00:33:49.861
IT IS A RESERVE AND SO WE'VE

00:33:49.927 --> 00:33:50.995
SHOWN IT DOWN THERE. THE

00:33:51.062 --> 00:33:52.296
ASSEMBLY TOOK A SLIGHTLY

00:33:52.363 --> 00:33:53.331
DIFFERENT ACTION.

00:33:53.398 --> 00:33:55.032
THEY'VE SET UP WHAT THEY CALL

00:33:55.099 --> 00:33:55.199
THE.

00:33:55.266 --> 00:33:56.634
.

00:33:56.701 --> 00:33:57.502
THE BUDGET DEFICIT SAVINGS

00:33:57.568 --> 00:33:59.537
ACCOUNT THESE ARE FUNDS THAT THE

00:33:59.604 --> 00:34:00.671
LEGISLATURE MAINTAINS A LITTLE

00:34:00.738 --> 00:34:01.739
MORE CONTROL THROUGHOUT THE

00:34:01.806 --> 00:34:03.641
FISCAL YEAR AT THE END OF MAY

00:34:03.708 --> 00:34:04.842
THOUGH IF ALL THE ESTIMATES ARE

00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:06.210
EXTRA WHAT WE THINK THEY ARE.

00:34:06.277 --> 00:34:07.311
THAT MONEY WHICH IS GOING TO THE

00:34:07.378 --> 00:34:08.479
BSA AND THE TOTAL WOULD BE NO

00:34:08.546 --> 00:34:09.514
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:10.681
ADMINISTRATION HAS.

00:34:10.748 --> 00:34:12.884
.

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:14.452
GIVEN THESE RESERVES AND THESE

00:34:14.519 --> 00:34:16.187
LEVELS ARE ALMOST UNPRECEDENTED

00:34:16.254 --> 00:34:17.422
THESE ARE. VERY HEALTHY RESERVE

00:34:17.488 --> 00:34:19.090
LEVELS

00:34:19.157 --> 00:34:19.991
AND I THINK THIS STATE HAS DONE

00:34:20.057 --> 00:34:21.325
AN EXCELLENT JOB THE LEGISLATURE

00:34:21.392 --> 00:34:22.894
WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.762
TO ESTABLISH THIS LEVEL RESERVE

00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:25.863
LEVELS OF OF RESERVES.

00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:27.865
.

00:34:27.932 --> 00:34:29.734
WITH THESE YOU COULD LIKELY

00:34:29.801 --> 00:34:32.470
WITHSTAND A MILD RECESSION.

00:34:32.537 --> 00:34:33.571
WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE.

00:34:33.638 --> 00:34:35.773
MUCH.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.375
SIGNIFICANT ACTION AS FAR AS

00:34:37.442 --> 00:34:38.176
CHANGING YOUR SPENDING LEVELS

00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:39.510
ARE YOUR REVENANTS.

00:34:39.577 --> 00:34:41.946
A MILD RECESSION.

00:34:42.013 --> 00:34:43.114
ANYTHING MORE THAN THAT IT WOULD

00:34:43.181 --> 00:34:44.148
STILL PROVIDE YOU QUITE A BIT OF

00:34:44.215 --> 00:34:45.450
TIME.

00:34:45.516 --> 00:34:47.885
TO ADJUST TO ANY DOWNTURN.

00:34:47.952 --> 00:34:49.587
SO THE THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT

00:34:49.654 --> 00:34:51.422
LEVELS OF RESERVES.

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:52.490
YOU CAN HAVE DISCUSSIONS WHETHER

00:34:52.557 --> 00:34:54.459
YOU WANT TO HAVE MORE. OR NOT

00:34:54.525 --> 00:34:55.560
YOU CAN SEE THE SENATE IS A

00:34:55.626 --> 00:34:56.427
LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN THE

00:34:56.494 --> 00:34:57.995
ASSEMBLY PLAN.

00:34:58.062 --> 00:34:59.864
BUT BUT THESE ARE.

00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:01.666
HEALTHY LEVELS AND IT SHOWS

00:35:01.732 --> 00:35:03.034
INCREDIBLE PROGRESS OVER RECENT

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.336
YEARS.

00:35:05.403 --> 00:35:07.805
YOU ALSO ANOTHER WAY THAT YOU

00:35:07.872 --> 00:35:09.207
HAVE PROTECTION AGAINST DOWNTURN

00:35:09.273 --> 00:35:10.441
IN ADDITION TO RESERVES ARE ONE

00:35:10.508 --> 00:35:13.678
TIME SPENDING.

00:35:13.744 --> 00:35:14.278
BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE ONE TIME

00:35:14.345 --> 00:35:16.147
SPENDING. THAT GOES AWAY IN THE

00:35:16.214 --> 00:35:17.315
NEXT YEAR YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE

00:35:17.381 --> 00:35:18.683
AS MANY ADJUSTMENTS.

00:35:18.749 --> 00:35:20.485
SO ONE THING TO KEEP.

00:35:20.551 --> 00:35:22.086
THE COGNITIVE IS HOW MUCH ONE

00:35:22.153 --> 00:35:23.754
TIME SPENDING TO HEAR.

00:35:23.821 --> 00:35:25.289
NOW THE ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS

00:35:25.356 --> 00:35:26.958
THAT THE SENATE MADE ON TOP OF

00:35:27.024 --> 00:35:28.726
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THEY MAKE

00:35:28.793 --> 00:35:30.361
ABOUT A THIRD A LITTLE OVER

00:35:30.428 --> 00:35:31.896
THIRTY ONE TIME THE ASSEMBLY

00:35:31.963 --> 00:35:33.998
MAKES ABOUT HALF OF THEIR.

00:35:34.065 --> 00:35:34.932
AUGMENTATIONS AND ONE TIME

00:35:34.999 --> 00:35:37.001
JUST SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND.

00:35:37.068 --> 00:35:38.936
NOW OFF SETTING THAT IS THAT

00:35:39.003 --> 00:35:41.172
EACH HOUSE HAS A LOUD RATHER

00:35:41.239 --> 00:35:42.006
LARGE EXPENDITURE THAT GROWS

00:35:42.073 --> 00:35:44.041
OVER TIME.

00:35:44.108 --> 00:35:45.209
AND AGAIN WE'LL TALK A BIT MORE

00:35:45.276 --> 00:35:46.844
ABOUT THAT THIS IN ITS COWARDS

00:35:46.911 --> 00:35:48.613
PROPOSAL IS PHASED IN SUCH AS IT

00:35:48.679 --> 00:35:50.848
GROWS THE COST GROW OVER TIME.

00:35:50.915 --> 00:35:52.483
AND THE HOUSE HAS A ABOUT THE

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.151
ASSEMBLY HAS A HEALTH PROPOSAL

00:35:54.218 --> 00:35:56.287
THAT WOULD GROW OVER TIME.

00:35:56.354 --> 00:35:57.688
NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU

00:35:57.755 --> 00:35:59.290
CAN'T HAVE PROPOSALS THAT GROW

00:35:59.357 --> 00:36:01.158
IN THE OUT YEARS.

00:36:01.225 --> 00:36:02.026
WHAT IT MEANS IS YOU WANT TO

00:36:02.093 --> 00:36:03.861
JUST BE SENSITIVE TO TO EITHER

00:36:03.928 --> 00:36:04.929
OF THE SENATE'S APPROACH ON

00:36:04.996 --> 00:36:06.097
RESERVES WELL MAYBE WHEN I HAVE

00:36:06.163 --> 00:36:07.798
A FEW MORE RESERVES?

00:36:07.865 --> 00:36:08.432
OR THE ASSEMBLY IS APPROACHING

00:36:08.499 --> 00:36:09.667
ONE TIME MAYBE ONE HAVE SOME

00:36:09.734 --> 00:36:11.135
MORE ONE TIME. THESE ARE THE

00:36:11.202 --> 00:36:11.936
THINGS THAT YOU BALLOTS IN

00:36:12.003 --> 00:36:15.006
MAKING YOUR DECISIONS.

00:36:15.072 --> 00:36:16.974
WE GO TO PAGE TWO.

00:36:17.041 --> 00:36:18.409
THIS THIS THIS REALLY HELPS

00:36:18.476 --> 00:36:19.310
EXPLAIN HOW YOU'RE DIFFERENT

00:36:19.377 --> 00:36:21.879
FROM THE GOVERNOR'S.

00:36:21.946 --> 00:36:23.147
AND THE HOUSES ARE FAIRLY MUCH

00:36:23.214 --> 00:36:24.515
THEY'RE VERY SIMILAR IN HOW THEY

00:36:24.582 --> 00:36:26.183
DIFFER FROM THE GOVERNOR. THAT

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:27.618
SINGLE BIGGEST ASSUMPTION IS AS

00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:29.153
I MENTIONED YOU'VE TAKEN OUR

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.489
ESTIMATES OF REVENANTS.

00:36:31.556 --> 00:36:32.823
IT'S ABOUT TWO POINT SEVEN TWO

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:33.758
POINT EIGHT THERE'S A SLIGHT

00:36:33.824 --> 00:36:35.660
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOUSES.

00:36:35.726 --> 00:36:36.794
NOW THAT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF

00:36:36.861 --> 00:36:38.329
MONEY BECAUSE IT IS ESPECIALLY

00:36:38.396 --> 00:36:38.896
WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT

00:36:38.963 --> 00:36:40.197
SPENDING. FROM A REVENUE

00:36:40.264 --> 00:36:42.033
ESTIMATING PERSPECTIVE.

00:36:42.099 --> 00:36:44.201
THIS IS A TWO YEAR DIFFERENCE

00:36:44.268 --> 00:36:44.835
IT'S A LITTLE OVER ONE PERCENT A

00:36:44.902 --> 00:36:46.003
YEAR.

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:47.405
THAT'S NOT A HUGE DIFFERENCE

00:36:47.471 --> 00:36:48.039
BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND

00:36:48.105 --> 00:36:51.175
US.

00:36:51.242 --> 00:36:51.742
AND IT'S JUST THAT WE HAVE

00:36:51.809 --> 00:36:52.310
DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES OF

00:36:52.376 --> 00:36:54.145
ESTIMATING REVENUES.

00:36:54.211 --> 00:36:56.113
AND YOU DECIDED TO GO WITH OURS

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:57.515
SO THAT GIVES YOU ALMOST THREE

00:36:57.582 --> 00:36:58.749
BILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL

00:36:58.816 --> 00:37:00.551
RESOURCES NOW AS A RESULT OF

00:37:00.618 --> 00:37:02.320
TAKING THOSE REVENUES YOU HAVE

00:37:02.386 --> 00:37:03.487
SOME ADDITIONAL RESERVE

00:37:03.554 --> 00:37:04.455
REQUIREMENTS AS YOU SEE ONLINE

00:37:04.522 --> 00:37:06.257
TO. SOME ADDITIONAL PROPOSITION

00:37:06.324 --> 00:37:07.925
TO DEBT REQUIREMENTS THOSE

00:37:07.992 --> 00:37:10.428
OFFSET YOUR GAINES.

00:37:10.494 --> 00:37:11.696
YOU'D MADE ANOTHER ASSUMPTION

00:37:11.762 --> 00:37:12.897
BOTH HOUSES THAT YOU WOULD USE

00:37:12.964 --> 00:37:15.132
OUR PROPERTY TAX REVENUES.

00:37:15.199 --> 00:37:16.334
THAT DOESN'T CHANGE PROPOSITION

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.902
NINETY EIGHT AT ALL.

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:19.904
IT JUST CHANGES THAT THE

00:37:19.971 --> 00:37:20.504
CONSISTENCY THE MAKE UP OF

00:37:20.571 --> 00:37:21.839
BETWEEN GENERAL FUND IMPROPER

00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:23.674
TAXES SO YOU HAVE LESS GENERAL

00:37:23.741 --> 00:37:24.709
FUND THAT THAT YOU HAVE TO

00:37:24.775 --> 00:37:26.310
DEDICATE TOWARDS NINETY EIGHT.

00:37:26.377 --> 00:37:27.345
THAT'S FREED UP IN YOUR

00:37:27.411 --> 00:37:29.680
AVAILABLE FOR OTHER PURPOSES.

00:37:29.747 --> 00:37:31.549
THEN ONE OTHER KEY CHANGE IN

00:37:31.616 --> 00:37:32.450
THINKING ABOUT WHAT WHAT'S YOUR

00:37:32.516 --> 00:37:33.985
TOTAL AMOUNT YOU HAVE DIFFERENT

00:37:34.051 --> 00:37:35.586
FROM THE GOVERNOR. IS THAT BOTH

00:37:35.653 --> 00:37:36.854
HOUSES REJECTED SOME OF THE

00:37:36.921 --> 00:37:38.589
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS.

00:37:38.656 --> 00:37:39.190
PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF

00:37:39.256 --> 00:37:39.757
INFRASTRUCTURE AND DEFERRED

00:37:39.824 --> 00:37:42.393
MAINTENANCE.

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:43.894
GO TO THE BOTTOM LINE THERE

00:37:43.961 --> 00:37:45.262
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE

00:37:45.329 --> 00:37:46.597
THE SENATE HAS ABOUT THREE AND A

00:37:46.664 --> 00:37:48.633
HALF BILLION ALMOST.

00:37:48.699 --> 00:37:50.301
THE ASSEMBLY HAS FOUR BILLION ON

00:37:50.368 --> 00:37:53.204
TOP OF WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAD.

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:54.238
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THOSE THE

00:37:54.305 --> 00:37:55.272
HOUSES DID A LOT OF THINGS THE

00:37:55.339 --> 00:37:57.575
SAME?

00:37:57.642 --> 00:37:58.809
BUT THE SENATE AS YOU CAN SEE

00:37:58.876 --> 00:38:00.411
TOOK FROM THAT THAT THREE POINT

00:38:00.478 --> 00:38:02.580
FOR THAT THEY HAD THEY SET UP

00:38:02.647 --> 00:38:03.180
THAT NEW RESERVE THAT I TALKED

00:38:03.247 --> 00:38:04.115
ABOUT.

00:38:04.181 --> 00:38:05.950
THAT'S SET ASIDE.

00:38:06.017 --> 00:38:07.151
A RESERVE

00:38:07.218 --> 00:38:09.220
FOR THE SAFETY NET.

00:38:09.286 --> 00:38:10.955
THEN THEY MADE NEW COMMITMENTS

00:38:11.022 --> 00:38:11.455
AND THESE ARE PRIMARILY

00:38:11.522 --> 00:38:13.024
EXPENDITURES THERE ARE SOME

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:14.425
REVENUE REDUCTIONS TO SOME OF

00:38:14.492 --> 00:38:14.959
THAT'S WHY WE USE THE WORD

00:38:15.026 --> 00:38:15.993
COMMITMENT.

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.629
OF TWO POINT NINE BILLION.

00:38:18.696 --> 00:38:20.097
NOW ANYBODY DOING THEIR QUICK

00:38:20.164 --> 00:38:21.265
MATH WOULD SEE THAT WELL THAT'S

00:38:21.332 --> 00:38:22.733
THREE POINT NINE IN NEW. AND YET

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:23.834
WE HAVE THREE POINT FOR AN

00:38:23.901 --> 00:38:25.136
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND WHAT

00:38:25.202 --> 00:38:26.370
HAPPENS IS THAT'S WHY IF YOU

00:38:26.437 --> 00:38:27.938
LOOK ON THE PRIOR PAGE.

00:38:28.005 --> 00:38:29.874
THEIR REGULAR RESERVE OUR SFU

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.575
YOU AS WE REFER TO IT. IS

00:38:31.642 --> 00:38:32.343
ACTUALLY LESS THAN THE

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:34.845
ADMINISTRATION'S.

00:38:34.912 --> 00:38:36.313
I THE ASSEMBLY JUST MAKES FOUR

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:39.350
BILLION IN NEW COMMITMENTS.

00:38:39.417 --> 00:38:41.452
SO IF YOU GO THE LAST PAGE THIS

00:38:41.519 --> 00:38:43.320
REALLY SHOWS.

00:38:43.387 --> 00:38:45.723
SOME OF THE REALLY BIG PIECES OF

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:47.224
THOSE LEGISLATIVE AUGMENTATIONS

00:38:47.291 --> 00:38:48.526
TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET.

00:38:48.592 --> 00:38:50.361
AND.

00:38:50.428 --> 00:38:51.228
IT IT'S NOT GOING TO TELL YOU

00:38:51.295 --> 00:38:52.930
THE WHOLE STORY FOR EXAMPLE ON

00:38:52.997 --> 00:38:54.031
HOMELESSNESS THE FIRST ITEM THAT

00:38:54.098 --> 00:38:55.800
WE HAVE. THESE ARE JUST EIGHTEEN

00:38:55.866 --> 00:38:57.368
NINETEEN NUMBER SO IT DOESN'T

00:38:57.435 --> 00:38:58.502
SHOW THE SENATE'S PLAN WHICH AS

00:38:58.569 --> 00:39:00.237
A FOUR YEAR PLAN. YOU HAVE A

00:39:00.304 --> 00:39:02.006
TABLE LATER ON IN YOUR AGENDA

00:39:02.073 --> 00:39:02.573
THAT WILL GIVE YOU ALL THAT

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.008
DETAIL.

00:39:04.075 --> 00:39:05.543
BUT WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS TO SHOW

00:39:05.609 --> 00:39:06.077
YOU THE AMOUNT IN EIGHTEEN

00:39:06.143 --> 00:39:08.479
NINETEEN PLUS ENTRANCE IT SHOWS

00:39:08.546 --> 00:39:09.880
WHAT IS ONGOING IN ONGOING WE

00:39:09.947 --> 00:39:11.816
MEAN ON A PERMANENT BASIS NOT

00:39:11.882 --> 00:39:12.283
LIKE THE FOUR YEAR FOR

00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:13.517
HOMELESSNESS.

00:39:13.584 --> 00:39:14.919
JUST SO YOU CAN GET AN IDEA OF

00:39:14.985 --> 00:39:16.754
WHEN ARE YOU MAKING ONE TIME

00:39:16.821 --> 00:39:17.388
COMMITMENTS WHEN ARE YOU MAKING

00:39:17.455 --> 00:39:18.556

I THINK WHAT IS IS A. STANDS OUT

00:39:21.826 --> 00:39:23.761
IN THIS LIST IS HOW MANY.

00:39:23.828 --> 00:39:24.361
SIMILARITIES THERE ARE BETWEEN

00:39:24.428 --> 00:39:25.763

SENATE IS THE ONLY ONE TO TAKE

00:39:36.974 --> 00:39:38.509

00:39:47.218 --> 00:39:48.352
THERE'S A LOT OF SMALLER THINGS

00:39:48.419 --> 00:39:49.653

I AM JUST PROVIDING A BIG

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.708
OVERVIEW BUT I WILL PROVIDE.

00:40:44.775 --> 00:40:45.810
SOME COMMENTS FROM THE

00:40:45.876 --> 00:40:47.044
ADMINISTRATION SOME OF THE BIG.

00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:48.479
ITEMS THAT HE'S REFERENCE AS

00:40:48.546 --> 00:40:51.081
FAR AS REVENUES EXPENDITURES AND

00:40:51.148 --> 00:40:51.882
RESERVE FUNDS WHICH ARE REALLY

00:40:51.949 --> 00:40:53.851
KIND OF THE KEY STRUCTURES OF

00:40:53.918 --> 00:40:55.052
ANY BUDGET.

00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:56.821
ON AB AND ASSIST TESTIFIED AS

00:40:56.887 --> 00:40:58.656
I'VE TESTIFIED IN BOTH OF THE

00:40:58.722 --> 00:40:59.857
RESPECTIVE HOUSES A THERE ARE

00:40:59.924 --> 00:41:01.525
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE

00:41:01.592 --> 00:41:02.693
REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS BETWEEN THE

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.562
ADMINISTRATION AND AND AND THE

00:41:04.628 --> 00:41:06.530
ADOPTED BUDGET. ON ITS ROUGHLY

00:41:06.597 --> 00:41:07.631
TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION IS THE

00:41:07.698 --> 00:41:09.066
ANALYST'S NOTES WITH A SLIGHT

00:41:09.133 --> 00:41:10.935
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HOUSES

00:41:11.001 --> 00:41:12.269
BEHIND THE ASSEMBLY DID NOT.

00:41:12.336 --> 00:41:13.904
ADOPT THE ALEJO'S CORPORATION

00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:15.139
TAX.

00:41:15.206 --> 00:41:16.340
I'M SO THERE'S A SLIGHT DOLLAR

00:41:16.407 --> 00:41:17.775
DIFFERENCE THERE.

00:41:17.842 --> 00:41:19.844
I THINK OUR SERIOUS CONCERNS

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:21.846
ADOPTING AN OVERLY OPTIMISTIC

00:41:21.912 --> 00:41:24.515
REVENUE FORECAST ARE THAT.

00:41:24.582 --> 00:41:26.717
MUCH OF THE DIFFERENCE I'M AT

00:41:26.784 --> 00:41:28.319
THE HOUSE POINTS OUT BY A

00:41:28.385 --> 00:41:29.854
PERCENTAGE BASIS.

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.388
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A A BIG

00:41:31.455 --> 00:41:33.791
DOLLAR AMOUNT HOWEVER THE SOURCE

00:41:33.858 --> 00:41:35.359
OF REVENUE THAT IS UNDERLYING

00:41:35.426 --> 00:41:36.627
THE DIFFERENCE IS THE PERSONAL

00:41:36.694 --> 00:41:38.128
INCOME TAX AND CAPITAL GAINS

00:41:38.195 --> 00:41:39.363
BOTHOF WHICH ARE EXTREMELY

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:41.232
VOLATILE. AND HAD TRADITIONALLY

00:41:41.298 --> 00:41:43.601
VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICTS.

00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:45.603
ON AS SUCH AND WE'VE OFTEN NOTED

00:41:45.669 --> 00:41:47.605
ONE PERCENT OF TAXPAYERS PAY

00:41:47.671 --> 00:41:49.506
NEARLY FIFTY PERCENT OF THE

00:41:49.573 --> 00:41:50.941
PERSONAL INCOME TAX IN THE STATE.

00:41:51.008 --> 00:41:51.709
SO THAT GIVES YOU AN

00:41:51.775 --> 00:41:53.577
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW ON

00:41:53.644 --> 00:41:54.745
SENSITIVE THAT PARTICULAR

00:41:54.812 --> 00:41:56.714
REVENUE SOURCES.

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.215
THE LA OWES REVENUE FORECAST AND

00:41:58.282 --> 00:42:00.084
FINANCE FORECAST BOTH PROJECT

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:01.485
HIGH GROWTH IN CAPITAL GAINS

00:42:01.552 --> 00:42:01.752
WITH.

00:42:02.753 --> 00:42:05.055
BOTH PROJECTIONS ARE MAKING

00:42:05.122 --> 00:42:05.789
THEM SUBJECT TO PRETTY

00:42:05.856 --> 00:42:08.525
SIGNIFICANT DOWNSIDE RISK.

00:42:08.592 --> 00:42:09.159
WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE CURRENT

00:42:09.226 --> 00:42:11.528
ECONOMIC EXPANSION IS NEARING.

00:42:11.595 --> 00:42:13.364
THE LONGEST IN HISTORY WE'VE

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:15.065
LISTED POTENTIAL RISKS TO THE

00:42:15.132 --> 00:42:16.901
REVENUE FORECAST.

00:42:16.967 --> 00:42:18.802
THAT INCLUDE A RECESSION STOCK

00:42:18.869 --> 00:42:20.604
MARKET CORRECTION AND THE

00:42:20.671 --> 00:42:22.106
FEDERAL ARE GOVERNMENT SHIFTING

00:42:22.172 --> 00:42:24.174
COSTS DOWN TO THE STATE AS WELL

00:42:24.241 --> 00:42:26.210
AS TRADE WARS.

00:42:26.277 --> 00:42:27.678
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REST CABS

00:42:27.745 --> 00:42:29.513
INTENSIFIED SINCE WE RELEASED IN

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:30.848
JANUARY UNTIL NOW WITH THE

00:42:30.915 --> 00:42:32.016
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVING

00:42:32.082 --> 00:42:34.752
PROPOSALS FOR RECISIONS SO. THAT

00:42:34.818 --> 00:42:36.253
RISK ITSELF HASN'T CHANGED BUT

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:37.554
WE WOULD ARGUE THAT HAS

00:42:37.621 --> 00:42:39.423
INTENSIFIED AND IT DOES I POSE A

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:41.558
THREAT ONTO THE OVERALL. BUDGET

00:42:41.625 --> 00:42:43.794
WENT DOWN.

00:42:43.861 --> 00:42:45.296
IN THE EXPENDITURES I WILL GIVE

00:42:45.362 --> 00:42:46.363
YOU A PREVIEW OF WHAT YOU'LL

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:47.932
HEAR ME SAY LIKELY THROUGHOUT

00:42:47.998 --> 00:42:49.833
MUCH OF CONFERENCE WHICH IS THAT.

00:42:51.502 --> 00:42:53.404
THE PROPOSED AUGMENTATIONS

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:54.538
CANNOT B SUPPORTED BY THE

00:42:54.605 --> 00:42:56.073
ADMINISTRATION GIVEN THE

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.908
RAVENOUS AND SO ON MANY TIMES

00:42:57.975 --> 00:42:59.243
THAT WILL BE WITHOUT PREJUDICE

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:00.544
TO A PARTICULAR PROPOSAL

00:43:00.611 --> 00:43:02.246
OBVIOUSLY. FOR WORKING OFF A

00:43:02.313 --> 00:43:03.681
DIFFERENT TOTAL NUMBERS ON THE

00:43:03.747 --> 00:43:05.416
REVENUE SIDE.

00:43:05.482 --> 00:43:06.817
THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO

00:43:06.884 --> 00:43:08.185
ENSURE THAT ANY OF THE

00:43:08.252 --> 00:43:09.720
EXPENDITURES THAT ARE INCLUDED

00:43:09.787 --> 00:43:11.121
IN THE BUDGET REALLY ALIGNED

00:43:11.188 --> 00:43:13.057
WITH OUR HOW MORE REASONABLE

00:43:13.123 --> 00:43:13.624
REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS PREVENT

00:43:13.691 --> 00:43:14.792
PUSHING.

00:43:14.858 --> 00:43:16.160
THE BUDGET OUT OF BALANCE AND TO

00:43:16.226 --> 00:43:17.828
PROTECT AGAINST MORE SIGNIFICANT

00:43:17.895 --> 00:43:20.597
BUDGET CUTS IN THE FUTURE.

00:43:20.664 --> 00:43:22.132
THE TYPES OF EXPENDITURES ARE

00:43:22.199 --> 00:43:24.168
IMPORTANT IN THE STRUCTURE OF

00:43:24.234 --> 00:43:25.536
THE BUDGET WHILE AND ALICE

00:43:25.602 --> 00:43:27.204
POINTED OUT AND YOU KNOW THE

00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:28.806
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONGOING AND

00:43:28.872 --> 00:43:30.441
ONE TIME EXPENDITURES IN THE

00:43:30.507 --> 00:43:32.376
ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET WE'VE

00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:33.544
REALLY LIMITED ON GOING.

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:35.446
EXPENDITURES.

00:43:35.512 --> 00:43:37.281
SO THAT WE CAN AVOID.

00:43:37.348 --> 00:43:38.983
CUTS TO PROGRAMS WHEN THERE IS

00:43:39.049 --> 00:43:40.551
A RECESSION.

00:43:40.617 --> 00:43:42.052
ON EACH HOUSE IS INCLUDED

00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:43.554
BILLIONS IN ADDITIONAL NON

NINETY GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES.

00:43:46.223 --> 00:43:47.758
IN SOME CASES THE ADMINISTRATION

00:43:47.825 --> 00:43:48.993
BELIEVES THAT THE COSTS ARE

00:43:49.059 --> 00:43:50.995
SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERSTATED BASED

00:43:51.061 --> 00:43:52.696
ON WHAT THE HOUSES OF ADOPTED.

00:43:52.763 --> 00:43:53.998

FREQUENTLY DISCUSSED THE NEED

00:44:14.618 --> 00:44:16.153
FOR ROBUST RESERVES ONTO

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:17.621

I'M AS THE ANALYST NOTED THE

SENATE HAS PROPOSED A SAFETY NET

00:44:28.332 --> 00:44:29.466
OF A RESERVE OF ONE BILLION

00:44:29.533 --> 00:44:30.901
DOLLARS WHICH WOULD INCLUDE

00:44:30.968 --> 00:44:32.236
FUNDING TO HELP PROVIDE SOME

00:44:32.302 --> 00:44:33.804
MEASURE OF STABILITY FOR CAL

00:44:33.871 --> 00:44:35.572
WORKS AYE WHICH OFTEN FACES CUTS

00:44:35.639 --> 00:44:38.008
DURING ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS WHEN I

THE STATE WAS REALLY GOOD ABOUT

00:45:45.909 --> 00:45:49.313
TAKING LOCAL FUNDS AWAY.

00:45:49.379 --> 00:45:51.381
FILL BUDGET GAPS.

00:45:51.448 --> 00:45:53.650

COUNTIES ONLY HAVE MAYBE WILL.

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:57.554
ONE VEHICLE TO RAISE MORE

00:45:57.621 --> 00:45:59.056
REVENUE AND THAT'S A SALES TAX

00:45:59.123 --> 00:46:01.058
INCREASE WHICH SEEMS TO BE A

00:46:01.125 --> 00:46:02.559
LITTLE MORE POPULAR MORE ON. BUT

00:46:02.626 --> 00:46:03.760
MORE BALLOTS TO TO RAISE

00:46:03.827 --> 00:46:05.262
REVENUES BECAUSE OF GROWING

00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:06.663
PENSION COSTS.

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:07.998
IT CENTER SO THEY'RE VERY

00:46:08.065 --> 00:46:09.566
LIMITED BUT THE STATE HAS BEEN

00:46:09.633 --> 00:46:09.833
ENJOYING.

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:11.735
THIS.

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:14.138
WE USE THE TERM SURPLUS.

00:46:14.204 --> 00:46:17.274
SO WE WE GOT GAS TAX WE'VE GOT.

00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:18.775
ALL INCOME TAX ALL THE

00:46:18.842 --> 00:46:21.545
EVERYTHING IN PLACE IT'S GIVING.

IN TIMES OF BOUNTY IS IT

00:46:27.484 --> 00:46:29.086
POSSIBLE FOR THE.

00:46:29.153 --> 00:46:31.688
STATE TO GIVE A LITTLE BACK TO

00:46:31.755 --> 00:46:34.491
THE LOCAL LEVELS.

00:46:34.558 --> 00:46:35.259
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOOD ABOUT

00:46:35.325 --> 00:46:37.594
TAKING IT IN TOUGH TIMES

00:46:37.661 --> 00:46:38.562
I JUST DON'T KNOW THE LAW BUT I

00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:39.463
JUST THOUGHT MAYBE YOU MIGHT

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:41.431
HAVE A PERSPECTIVE.

00:46:41.498 --> 00:46:42.799
WELL I THINK AS YOU POINTED OUT

00:46:42.866 --> 00:46:44.434
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS WE DO

00:46:44.501 --> 00:46:46.236
GIVE MORE MONEY BACK TO LOCALS

00:46:46.303 --> 00:46:47.371
SCHOOL SPENDING HAS GROWN

00:46:47.437 --> 00:46:49.139
SIGNIFICANTLY. THAT GOES TO

00:46:49.206 --> 00:46:50.607
LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS EVEN

00:46:50.674 --> 00:46:51.742
THOUGH OBVIOUSLY THE STATE. A

00:46:51.808 --> 00:46:53.043
CONTROLS A LOT OF THE OVERALL

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:54.878
FUNDING BUT IT HAS INCREASED A

00:46:54.945 --> 00:46:56.813
LOT OF THE GAS TAX MONIES GOES

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:59.049
TO LOCAL CONTROL. I KNOW IN SOME

00:46:59.116 --> 00:47:00.584
OF THE HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE

00:47:00.651 --> 00:47:01.185
CENTER MITCHELL CROPS BECAUSE

00:47:01.251 --> 00:47:02.586
BETTER NIGHT BUT THERE'S BEEN

00:47:02.653 --> 00:47:04.154
EFFORTS TO INCREASE COUNTY

00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:05.689
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS SO. ICE I

00:47:05.756 --> 00:47:06.757
IMAGINE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT

00:47:06.823 --> 00:47:07.591
THEIR IF SOMETHING THAT

00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:09.293
CERTAINLY HAVE A BENEFICIAL

00:47:09.359 --> 00:47:10.427
EFFECT.

00:47:10.494 --> 00:47:11.528
IF YOU'RE ASKING SHOULD WE THINK

00:47:11.595 --> 00:47:13.463
BROAD MORE BROADLY ABOUT LOCAL

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:14.331
RELIEF.

00:47:14.398 --> 00:47:15.098
THAT'S A DIFFICULT ONE FOR ME

00:47:15.165 --> 00:47:16.934
TO ADDRESS

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:17.768
I'M NOT SURE WHAT FORM THAT

00:47:17.834 --> 00:47:19.469
WOULD TAKE. UP ONE OTHER AREA

00:47:19.536 --> 00:47:20.604
WHERE I KNOW THE LEGISLATURE HAS

00:47:20.671 --> 00:47:22.172
BEEN REALLY CONCERNED HAS HAS

00:47:22.239 --> 00:47:24.141
BEEN ABOUT LOCAL PENSION COST.

00:47:24.208 --> 00:47:25.809
BOTH FOR SCHOOLS AND FOR LOCAL

00:47:25.876 --> 00:47:27.477
GOVERNMENTS AND I'M NOT SURE

00:47:27.544 --> 00:47:29.246
THERE'S MUCH IN. THIS BUDGET ON

00:47:29.313 --> 00:47:30.380
THAT BUT THAT IS CERTAINLY A AND

00:47:30.447 --> 00:47:31.448
AN AREA THAT'S GOTTEN A LOT OF

00:47:31.515 --> 00:47:33.183
CONVERSATION.

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:34.518
WELL I YOU KNOW JUST KIND OF

00:47:34.585 --> 00:47:36.286
THINKING OUT OF THE BOX AND NOT

00:47:36.353 --> 00:47:37.921
KNOWING ALL THE RULES. IF WE

00:47:37.988 --> 00:47:39.790
WORK TO GIVE.

00:47:39.856 --> 00:47:40.791
YOU KNOW SINCE WE HAVE WE'RE

00:47:40.857 --> 00:47:43.026
TALKING NINE BILLION IF WE WERE

00:47:43.093 --> 00:47:43.994
TO SAY LET'S TAKE A LITTLE BIT

00:47:44.061 --> 00:47:45.662
OF THAT. GIVE IT TO CITIES AND

00:47:45.729 --> 00:47:47.364
COUNTIES BUT JUST SPECIFICALLY

00:47:47.431 --> 00:47:48.932
DESIGNATED FOR THEIR PENSION.

00:47:48.999 --> 00:47:50.968
PLANS

00:47:51.034 --> 00:47:53.103
AS A CONTRIBUTION THAT WAVE WE

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:54.137
SORT OF DO A REBATE BECAUSE A

00:47:54.204 --> 00:47:55.772
REYES HAS WHAT YOU GOT TOO MUCH

00:47:55.839 --> 00:47:57.374
IN TAX REVENUE. YOU GIVE BACK TO

00:47:57.441 --> 00:47:59.076
TAXPAYERS BUT THIS TO BE A WAY

00:47:59.142 --> 00:48:00.444
TO GIVE BACK TO THE TAXPAYERS IN

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:02.079
AN INDIRECT WAY. AND IT WOULD

00:48:02.145 --> 00:48:03.447
HELP MAYBE CITIES AND COUNTIES

00:48:03.513 --> 00:48:05.215
TO KEEP A POLICE OFFICER PER

00:48:05.282 --> 00:48:07.651
YEAR TWO OR. SO LONGER AVERAGE

00:48:07.718 --> 00:48:09.653
JUST AN IDEA SIDE.

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:10.254
WHEN THERE SHOULD CERTAINLY I

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:10.921
KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK

00:48:10.988 --> 00:48:11.888
ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE DONE ON

00:48:11.955 --> 00:48:12.689
SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

00:48:12.756 --> 00:48:14.725
WHO ARE?

00:48:14.791 --> 00:48:15.926
CERTAINLY FACING EVEN HIRING

00:48:15.993 --> 00:48:17.527
CREASES IN THE OUT YEARS

00:48:17.594 --> 00:48:19.296
ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE DONE TO HELP

00:48:19.363 --> 00:48:20.864
THEM AND CERTAINLY BY GIVING A

00:48:20.931 --> 00:48:22.432
LOT OF MONEY ON THEY'LL CFF THAT

00:48:22.499 --> 00:48:24.234
IS DISCRETIONARY MONEY. THAT

00:48:24.301 --> 00:48:26.470
DOES HELP THEM SO IT IT IT'S A

00:48:26.536 --> 00:48:27.938
LITTLE HARD TO STOP THE CUT THE

00:48:28.005 --> 00:48:28.572
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION BUT IT'S A

00:48:28.639 --> 00:48:30.073
GOOD ONE. HOW YOU THINK ABOUT

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:31.308
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AT THIS DURING

00:48:31.375 --> 00:48:32.909
THESE GOOD TIMES

00:48:32.976 --> 00:48:34.578
AND I'M WONDERING ON A DIFFERENT

00:48:34.645 --> 00:48:36.413
SUBJECT OF? GAS BEES CAN REQUIRE

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.881
THAT THE STATE REPORT ON ITS.

00:48:37.948 --> 00:48:39.116
COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL

00:48:39.182 --> 00:48:40.717
REPORT AS OF JUNE THIRTY THIS

00:48:40.784 --> 00:48:42.753
YEAR. THE RETIREE MEDICAL

00:48:42.819 --> 00:48:44.388
LIABILITY WHICH THE CONTROLLER

00:48:44.454 --> 00:48:45.589
SAID IS NINETY ONE AND A HALF

00:48:45.656 --> 00:48:46.623
BILLION DOLLARS.

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:48.392
DO WE HAVE

00:48:48.458 --> 00:48:49.893
A WAY OF PAYING THAT DOWN OTHER

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:50.894
THAN JUST WITHHOLDING FROM

00:48:50.961 --> 00:48:52.696
EMPLOYEES.

00:48:52.763 --> 00:48:53.864
WELL I THINK THE WHOLE THE GOOD

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:54.731
THE ADMINISTRATION'S WHOLE PRE

00:48:54.798 --> 00:48:56.600
FUNDING PLAN.

00:48:56.667 --> 00:48:57.534
THAT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED

00:48:57.601 --> 00:48:58.702
THROUGH THE VARIOUS COLLECTIVE

00:48:58.769 --> 00:48:59.736
BARGAINING AGREEMENTS IS TO TRY

00:48:59.803 --> 00:49:01.838
TO ADDRESS THAT.

00:49:01.905 --> 00:49:03.373
I DON'T KNOW WHAT AT WHAT POINT

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.075
YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR YOUR

00:49:05.142 --> 00:49:06.843
INTEREST EARNING ASSUMPTION THAT

00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:08.679
WOULD REDUCE THOSE LIABILITIES

00:49:08.745 --> 00:49:10.013
DRAMATICALLY A FORGET THE POINT

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.548
AT WHICH YOU HAVE TO.

00:49:11.615 --> 00:49:12.749
YOU KNOW HAVE SHOWN PROGRESS IN

00:49:12.816 --> 00:49:14.618
IN IN FINDING THOSE LIABILITIES

00:49:14.685 --> 00:49:16.486
BUT. CERTAINLY THE

00:49:16.553 --> 00:49:18.088
ADMINISTRATION HAS HAS HAD HAS

00:49:18.155 --> 00:49:18.989
THIS PLAN THAT IS BEING

00:49:19.056 --> 00:49:20.223
IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE VARIOUS

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:21.458
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS

00:49:21.525 --> 00:49:23.160
THAT OVER TIME.

00:49:23.226 --> 00:49:24.594
WE'LL GET THOSE THE SPREE FUNDED.

00:49:24.661 --> 00:49:26.196
CAVEMAN THEN.

00:49:26.263 --> 00:49:28.298
YOU MENTIONED TO.

00:49:28.365 --> 00:49:29.399
STRATEGIES OF DEALING WITH THE

00:49:29.466 --> 00:49:30.500
RECESSION THE FIRST IS TO USE

00:49:30.567 --> 00:49:31.902
OUR RESERVES.

00:49:31.968 --> 00:49:32.703
THE SECOND IS THAT WE'RE DOING

00:49:32.769 --> 00:49:34.438
ONE TIME PAYMENT SO WE STOP

00:49:34.504 --> 00:49:37.274
THOSE IS THEIR STRATEGY.

00:49:37.341 --> 00:49:38.608
SINCE WE'RE ALL HERE PER SHORT

00:49:38.675 --> 00:49:40.310
TIME OVERLOOKING A LONG TERM

00:49:40.377 --> 00:49:42.512
HORIZON WHERE WHEN THERE IS A

00:49:42.579 --> 00:49:44.281
RECESSION WE HAVE SORT OF A

00:49:44.348 --> 00:49:45.749
STRATEGY OF WHAT WEAK AT FIRST.

00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:47.217
OR PRIORITY LIKE AS WERE ADDING

00:49:47.284 --> 00:49:48.452
THINGS.

00:49:48.518 --> 00:49:50.887
THE WEEK WE GIVE THEM A RANK

00:49:50.954 --> 00:49:52.289
SO THAT'S OKAY IF WE HAVE A

00:49:52.356 --> 00:49:54.624
DECLINE IN REVENUES OF OUR ONE

00:49:54.691 --> 00:49:56.126
PERCENTERS. DON'T.

00:49:56.193 --> 00:49:58.061
PRODUCE BECAUSE OF A DOWNTURN

00:49:58.128 --> 00:49:59.896
NO CAPITAL GAINS.

00:49:59.963 --> 00:50:01.331
DO WE DO WE CAN HELP THE NEXT

00:50:01.398 --> 00:50:02.632
ADMINISTRATION. OR

00:50:02.699 --> 00:50:04.668
ADMINISTRATIONS ON.

00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:06.069
YOU KNOW WHERE THE PRIORITY IS

00:50:06.136 --> 00:50:07.938
IN REVERSE POINT YOU CERTAINLY

00:50:08.004 --> 00:50:09.439
CAN DO THAT I THINK WHAT'S

00:50:09.506 --> 00:50:11.341
DIFFICULT IS NO LEGISLATURE CAN

00:50:11.408 --> 00:50:11.875
TIE THE HANDS OF A FUTURE

00:50:11.942 --> 00:50:12.876
LEGISLATION.

00:50:12.943 --> 00:50:13.643
EVEN IF IT'S A LOT OF THE

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:15.312
SIMILAR MEMBERSHIP.

00:50:15.379 --> 00:50:16.313
SO WHAT YOU MAY THINK OUR

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:17.781
PRIORITIES NOW MAY NOT BE THE

00:50:17.848 --> 00:50:18.815
PRIORITIES THAT YOU THINK ARE

00:50:18.882 --> 00:50:20.384
FOR EVEN FOUR YEARS FROM NOW.

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:21.852
SO IT I THINK YOU CAN THINK

00:50:21.918 --> 00:50:22.452
ABOUT THAT AND SORT OF BROAD

00:50:22.519 --> 00:50:23.987
TERMS

00:50:24.054 --> 00:50:24.921
BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY HARD

00:50:24.988 --> 00:50:26.056
ONCE YOU GET DOWN TO THE NITTY

00:50:26.123 --> 00:50:26.990
GRITTY OF FOR THIS IS WHAT WE

00:50:27.057 --> 00:50:28.058
WOULD. CUT OFF YOU KNOW OFF THE

00:50:28.125 --> 00:50:29.860
TOP.

00:50:29.926 --> 00:50:30.727
BECAUSE THOSE PRIORITIES CAN

00:50:30.794 --> 00:50:32.696
CHANGE.

00:50:32.763 --> 00:50:33.764
SO IT'S IT'S OF ITS A HEALTHY

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:34.931
WAY TO GO ABOUT DOING IT ANOTHER

00:50:34.998 --> 00:50:36.366
WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS HOW

00:50:36.433 --> 00:50:38.635
MUCH FLEXIBILITY DO YOU HAVE.

00:50:38.702 --> 00:50:39.970
I KNOW THERE'S REALLY STRONG

00:50:40.036 --> 00:50:41.171
FEELINGS THAT SOMETHING SHOULD

00:50:41.238 --> 00:50:42.906
BE CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED

00:50:42.973 --> 00:50:43.907
SOME STATUTES COALITION BE IN

00:50:43.974 --> 00:50:45.742
LAW.

00:50:45.809 --> 00:50:47.310
WHO ARE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT WHERE

00:50:47.377 --> 00:50:48.945
THAT COMES FROM YOU WANNA GIVE

00:50:49.012 --> 00:50:50.747
SEND SIGNALS TO LOCAL

00:50:50.814 --> 00:50:52.349
GOVERNMENTS TO COUNTY TO SCHOOLS

00:50:52.416 --> 00:50:53.383
THAT GIVE AND CERTAINLY ON THE

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:54.718
OTHER HAND IT TAKES AWAY YOUR

00:50:54.785 --> 00:50:56.253
FLEXIBILITY? BECAUSE IT'S MUCH

00:50:56.319 --> 00:50:57.521
HARDER TO CHANGE A STATUTORY

00:50:57.587 --> 00:50:58.889
GOAL THEN JUST MAKE YOUR

00:50:58.955 --> 00:51:00.056
DECISIONS ON ON YOUR ANNUAL

00:51:00.123 --> 00:51:01.324
BASIS.

00:51:01.391 --> 00:51:02.292
SO THERE ARE THERE ARE OTHER

00:51:02.359 --> 00:51:04.127
TOOLS YOU CAN THINK ABOUT OF HOW

00:51:04.194 --> 00:51:05.362
HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE MAINTAIN

00:51:05.429 --> 00:51:07.030
OUR FLEXIBILITY ONCE WE GET TO

00:51:07.097 --> 00:51:07.664
THAT POINT WHERE WE HAVE TO MAKE

00:51:07.731 --> 00:51:09.566
TOUGH DECISIONS.

00:51:09.633 --> 00:51:12.335
TAYLOR THINKS RICHER.

00:51:12.402 --> 00:51:13.570
IF THEY THINK YOU CENTER FOR THE

00:51:13.637 --> 00:51:15.272
ARE A GREAT QUESTION I WOULD

00:51:15.338 --> 00:51:16.673
WANT TO NOTE THAT IN BOTH BY.

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:18.141
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY PROPOSALS

00:51:18.208 --> 00:51:20.043
ARE QUITE ON A NUMBER OF

00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:21.812
AUGMENTATIONS WHICH GO DIRECTLY

00:51:21.878 --> 00:51:23.213
TO COUNTIES I KNOW AROUND

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:24.614
HOUSING HOMELESSNESS HUMAN

00:51:24.681 --> 00:51:27.350
SERVICES. NOT PUBLIC SAFETY

00:51:27.417 --> 00:51:28.952
COURTS ON SCIENCE I THINK THAT

00:51:29.019 --> 00:51:31.354
WE ARE WE'RE VERY COGNIZANT OF

00:51:31.421 --> 00:51:34.524
WHAT. IMPACT THEIR WORLD LOCALLY

00:51:34.591 --> 00:51:36.359
THEN DETROIT I THINK BOTH HOUSES

00:51:36.426 --> 00:51:38.128
TO TRY TO ADDRESS THEM.

00:51:38.195 --> 00:51:39.563
OTHER OTHER QUESTIONS FROM A

00:51:39.629 --> 00:51:42.566
MEMBER SIR NIELSEN.

00:51:42.632 --> 00:51:43.767
MISTER TAYLOR WHO.

00:51:43.834 --> 00:51:45.969
THE ONE THING THAT.

00:51:46.036 --> 00:51:48.405
A LEGISLATURE NOW CAN DO.

00:51:48.472 --> 00:51:49.773
AND A BIT OBLIGES ALL

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.608
LEGISLATURE'S UNTIL PROP TWO

00:51:51.675 --> 00:51:53.477
WOULD BE REPEALED AS PROP TWO.

00:51:53.543 --> 00:51:55.612
THAT IS ONE MAJOR THING THAT OF

00:51:55.679 --> 00:51:57.180
MANY OF US HAVE BEEN SEEKING FOR

00:51:57.247 --> 00:51:59.015
MANY MANY YEARS THEN IT SEEMS TO

00:51:59.082 --> 00:52:00.851
BE. ACCEPTED IN FACT EVEN MORE

00:52:00.917 --> 00:52:02.752
BRACED.

00:52:02.819 --> 00:52:03.987
THAT HAS MY QUESTION.

00:52:04.054 --> 00:52:05.522
IN THIS BUDGET.

00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:06.623
ADDITIONAL.

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:08.692
.

00:52:08.758 --> 00:52:10.327
THE RESERVE IS BENT BODY AND

00:52:10.393 --> 00:52:10.527
FLORA.

00:52:10.594 --> 00:52:12.395
.

00:52:12.462 --> 00:52:12.863
I GUESS WOULD BE.

00:52:12.963 --> 00:52:14.064
.

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:16.233
.

00:52:16.299 --> 00:52:18.201
A PARACHUTE ALLOWED MORE THAN

00:52:18.268 --> 00:52:19.135
MAYBE JUST.

00:52:19.236 --> 00:52:22.038
A SOFT LANDING.

00:52:22.105 --> 00:52:25.141
DIGITAL THAT SEEM TO YOU TO BE A

00:52:25.208 --> 00:52:27.244
HELPFUL STRATEGY.

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:29.112
THAT WE HAVE NOW CREATED OUR OWN

00:52:29.179 --> 00:52:30.580
IF YOU WILL RESERVE FOR CERTAIN.

00:52:30.647 --> 00:52:32.616
SET ASIDE.

00:52:32.682 --> 00:52:35.085
FUNDING WHERE IT KIND OF GOES TO

00:52:35.151 --> 00:52:36.219
CENTER MORLOCKS QUESTION OF

00:52:36.286 --> 00:52:38.088
WHERE WE SIGNAL OUR PRIORITIES.

00:52:38.154 --> 00:52:39.456
DID THE I THINK OF THE BILLION

00:52:39.523 --> 00:52:40.957
DOLLARS IS JUST ANOTHER PARTY

00:52:41.024 --> 00:52:43.126
RESERVE YOUR BSA HAS TOPPED OFF

00:52:43.193 --> 00:52:44.127
SO IF YOU WANT TO SET ASIDE

00:52:44.194 --> 00:52:46.263
MONEY AS OPPOSED TO SPENDING IT

00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:48.098
NOW OR COMMITTING IT NOW.

00:52:48.164 --> 00:52:49.299
IT'S IT'S GOOD THAT YOU JUST SET

00:52:49.366 --> 00:52:50.867
IT ASIDE.

00:52:50.934 --> 00:52:52.202
THAT THERE IS NOTHING THAT WOULD

00:52:52.269 --> 00:52:53.770
PREVENT YOU FROM USING THAT ON

00:52:53.837 --> 00:52:54.905
ANYTHING THAT YOU THOUGHT WERE

00:52:54.971 --> 00:52:56.373
HIGHER PRIORITY IT'S JUST A

00:52:56.439 --> 00:52:57.741
SIGNALING THAT THIS IS WHAT WE

00:52:57.807 --> 00:52:59.442
WANTED TO AND THAT CAN HAVE THAT

00:52:59.509 --> 00:53:01.378
CAN BE POWERFUL.

00:53:01.444 --> 00:53:02.712
BUT IT'S NOT MINDINGIT ANYWAY

00:53:02.779 --> 00:53:04.281
SO FOR ME THE MORE IMPORTANT

00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:05.715
POINT IS THAT YOU'VE INCREASED

00:53:05.782 --> 00:53:06.816
THE SENATE HAS INCREASED THEIR

00:53:06.883 --> 00:53:08.451
RESERVES.

00:53:08.518 --> 00:53:09.553
AND THE TARGETING IS I THINK

00:53:09.619 --> 00:53:11.488
MORE FOR YOU FOR YOU ALL OF HOW

00:53:11.555 --> 00:53:12.989
MUCH SORT OF SIGNALING. DO WE

00:53:13.056 --> 00:53:13.924
WANT TO DO HOW DO WE WANT TO

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:16.026
CHANGE THE SORT OF DEFAULT IN%

00:53:16.092 --> 00:53:16.393
THE FUTURE OF.

00:53:16.459 --> 00:53:17.627
WE SET THAT ASIDE FOR THESE

00:53:17.694 --> 00:53:19.429
PROGRAMS AND WE LIKE TO MAINTAIN

00:53:19.496 --> 00:53:21.064
THOSE COMMITMENTS.

00:53:21.131 --> 00:53:22.332
BUT IT'S I THINK THE MORE

00:53:22.399 --> 00:53:23.733
POWERFUL THING IS YOU PRESERVED

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:24.334
YOU'VE INCREASED YOUR RESERVE

00:53:24.401 --> 00:53:26.236
LEVELS.

00:53:26.303 --> 00:53:28.204
AND AND I LAW THAT THAT'S THAT'S

00:53:28.271 --> 00:53:30.774
A VERY GOOD DIRECTION I THINK.

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:32.609
I'M WARY THOUGH AS WE BUILD A

00:53:32.676 --> 00:53:34.044
BUDGET.

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:36.279
THAT WE DO THINGS THAT ARE.

00:53:36.346 --> 00:53:38.181
BASE BUILDING A COLLEGE THAT.

00:53:38.248 --> 00:53:40.317
GONNA RAISE.

00:53:40.383 --> 00:53:41.718
THE BASE AMOUNT FOR EVERY

00:53:41.785 --> 00:53:42.686
PREACHER BUDGET WILL BE BUILT

00:53:42.752 --> 00:53:44.421
UPON.

00:53:44.487 --> 00:53:46.156
AND PART OF OUR PROBLEMS IN THE

00:53:46.222 --> 00:53:47.624
PAST HAVE BEEN IN FACT THAT VERY

00:53:47.691 --> 00:53:49.626
POINT.

00:53:49.693 --> 00:53:50.694
AND ONE OTHER POINTED OUT

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.662
CAUTION THAT HAPPENED NOT TOO

00:53:52.729 --> 00:53:54.197
MANY YEARS AGO WHEN THERE WAS A

00:53:54.264 --> 00:53:56.633
FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL SURPLUS AND.

00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:59.035
AND THAT MONEY WAS SPENT.

00:53:59.102 --> 00:54:00.604
THEN THAT GREATLY CONTRIBUTED TO

00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:01.871
THE DISASTROUS FORTY FIVE

00:54:01.938 --> 00:54:03.473
BILLION DOLLAR.

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:04.941
DEFICIT THAT WE THEN LATER

00:54:05.008 --> 00:54:06.576
INCURRED RIGHT YES ALTHOUGH IN

00:54:06.643 --> 00:54:08.044
THIS CASE I THINK I WOULD THINK

00:54:08.111 --> 00:54:09.646
OF A MORE IS NOT BASED BUILDING

00:54:09.713 --> 00:54:10.180
IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE ONE

00:54:10.246 --> 00:54:11.481
BILLION.

00:54:11.548 --> 00:54:13.216
THAT'S MORE LIKE BASS PROTECTION

00:54:13.283 --> 00:54:14.618
YET NOT ALLOWED THE RESERVE I

00:54:14.684 --> 00:54:16.019
AGREE YEAH I AGREE WITH THAT

00:54:16.086 --> 00:54:16.820
YOU'RE ABOUT THE OTHER DECISION

00:54:16.886 --> 00:54:21.391
YES YES.

00:54:21.458 --> 00:54:24.027
THANK YOU MISTER OPEN OUT.

SENATOR NIELSEN'S QUESTION.

00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:31.968
ABOUT RESERVES SO AND THE TO DO

00:54:32.035 --> 00:54:33.703
BUDGETS BEFORE US THE SENATE'S

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:35.271
CREATED A NEW RESERVE ACCOUNT

SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC

00:54:43.046 --> 00:54:45.448
UNCERTAINTY. THAT UNLIKE THE

BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT

00:54:46.816 --> 00:54:48.284
DOES NOT HAVE A THE STATUTORY

00:54:48.351 --> 00:54:50.320
CAP ON IT SO WHY DO WE NEED TO
