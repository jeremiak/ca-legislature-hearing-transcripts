THAT ARE BEING PERPETRATED.

00:29:40.211 --> 00:29:42.147
EXPERTS SAY THAT THE FBI DATA

00:29:42.213 --> 00:29:44.282
LIKELY UNDERCOUNTS THE NUMBER

00:29:44.349 --> 00:29:46.417
OF HATE CRIMES IN AMERICA BOTH

00:29:46.484 --> 00:29:47.819
BECAUSE MANY VICTIMS DO NOT

00:29:47.886 --> 00:29:49.854
REPORT INCIDENTS AND LOCAL

00:29:49.921 --> 00:29:51.656

DEFINITION OF GUIDANCE. OKAY- I

00:43:25.235 --> 00:43:26.337
THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL HERE IS

00:43:27.738 --> 00:43:29.139
THAT IF WE DID HAVE IT I DON'T

00:43:29.206 --> 00:43:31.241

AMERICAN HISTORY. WHAT I. ARE

00:43:51.662 --> 00:43:54.732
THERE ANY SAFEGUARDS IN THIS

00:43:54.798 --> 00:43:59.236
THAT TIE INTO POLITICAL SPEECH

00:43:59.303 --> 00:44:01.672
MEANING THAT IF THERE IS A

00:44:01.739 --> 00:44:04.074
MESSAGE THAT IS PUT FORWARD BY

00:44:04.141 --> 00:44:06.243
AN ORGANIZATION OR A GROUP OF

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:07.878
INDIVIDUALS THAT IS POLITICAL

00:44:07.945 --> 00:44:11.415
IN NATURE. WOULD THAT BE A

00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:14.551
TARGET FOR REVIEW BY MEMBERS OF

00:44:14.618 --> 00:44:17.855
THIS COMMITTEE. BECAUSE OF ITS

00:44:17.921 --> 00:44:21.892

00:44:21.959 --> 00:44:23.460
POLITICAL SPEECH IN AND OF

00:44:23.527 --> 00:44:25.696
ITSELF- IS CERTAINLY NOT THE

00:44:25.763 --> 00:44:28.665
TOPIC- OR JURISDICTION OF THE

00:44:28.732 --> 00:44:32.302
PROPOSED COMMISSION. NO DOUBT

00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:35.172
I'M I'M I'M I'M A LITTLE. COOL

00:44:35.239 --> 00:44:36.206
CONCERNED IF WE START GETTING

00:44:36.273 --> 00:44:39.710
INTO A NONDESCRIPT HATE

00:44:39.777 --> 00:44:42.413
JURISDICTION- BECAUSE WE DON'T

00:44:42.479 --> 00:44:43.047
HAVE APPARENTLY ONE FOR

00:44:43.113 --> 00:44:45.315
CALIFORNIA THAT WE COULD BE

00:44:45.382 --> 00:44:49.219
VEERING INTO- AREAS THAT ARE

00:44:49.286 --> 00:44:51.622
OUTSIDE THE TRADITIONAL

00:44:51.688 --> 00:44:53.424
INTUITIVE UNDERSTANDING OF A

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:55.392
HATE CRIME. SO ARE THERE ANY

00:44:55.459 --> 00:44:57.761
SAFEGUARDS FOR THE JURISDICTION

00:44:57.828 --> 00:44:58.562
THE CREATION OF THE

00:44:58.629 --> 00:44:59.863
JURISDICTION FOR THIS TYPE OF

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:03.901
COMMITTEE. I THINK A PROFESSOR

00:45:03.967 --> 00:45:06.437
LEVIN MAY BE. THE BEST PERSON

00:45:06.503 --> 00:45:09.973

PRESENT I THINK THAT WOULD COME

00:45:25.522 --> 00:45:27.024
UNDER THE AMBIT BUT THERE MUST

00:45:27.091 --> 00:45:28.992

WHAT THE JURISDICTION GENERALLY

00:45:34.098 --> 00:45:36.600
IS ABOUT THE PERMISSIBLE STATUS

00:45:36.667 --> 00:45:37.868

DEFICIENT FOR OUR PURPOSES THAT

00:46:37.027 --> 00:46:38.962
THE DEFICIENCY IS AS DUE TO THE

00:46:39.029 --> 00:46:41.632

WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR-

00:58:51.094 --> 00:58:53.696
PURSUING THIS I'VE SPENT A GOOD

00:58:53.763 --> 00:58:56.633
AMOUNT OF TIME. IN THIS AREA

00:58:56.699 --> 00:58:58.935
AND I UNDERSTAND IF ANYBODY HAS

00:58:59.002 --> 00:59:03.339
GONE OVER OFF- TORREY PINES FOR

00:59:03.406 --> 00:59:06.309
EXAMPLE- THE EROSION THAT IS

00:59:06.376 --> 00:59:08.811
HAPPENING THERE IS. NOT ONLY IS

00:59:08.878 --> 00:59:11.381
IT ENVIRONMENTALLY SCARING BUT

00:59:11.447 --> 00:59:13.283
FROM A PHYSICAL STANDPOINT YOU

00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:15.318
CAN'T EVEN WALK ALONG THE BLUFF

00:59:15.385 --> 00:59:16.552
UNDERNEATH IT BECAUSE THERE

00:59:16.619 --> 00:59:18.388
HAVE BEEN FATALITIES OVER TIME

00:59:18.454 --> 00:59:20.023
HI THIS IS ABSOLUTELY HUGE I'M

00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:20.790
I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO BE

00:59:20.857 --> 00:59:22.825
SUPPORTING IT. BUT MY QUESTION

00:59:22.892 --> 00:59:24.327
TO YOU IS THERE'S NOT

00:59:24.394 --> 00:59:25.695
APPROPRIATION ATTACHED TO THIS

00:59:25.762 --> 00:59:29.899
BUT NUMBER ONE WHY ARE WE-

00:59:29.966 --> 00:59:32.101
ORIENTING THIS TOWARDS SCRIPTS

00:59:32.168 --> 00:59:34.037
AND SCRIPT STEPS AGAIN TESTED

00:59:34.103 --> 00:59:36.506
BUT WHY THEM AS OPPOSED TO

00:59:36.572 --> 00:59:38.241
REACHING OUT TO. THE COASTAL

00:59:38.308 --> 00:59:42.211
COMMISSION AND OTHER- OCEANIC

00:59:42.278 --> 00:59:46.816
RELATED ORGANIZATIONS- AND- IN

00:59:46.883 --> 00:59:48.284
IN NATURAL. PROTECTION

00:59:48.351 --> 00:59:49.652
ORGANIZATIONS THAT COULD DO

00:59:49.719 --> 00:59:51.955
SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND THREE

00:59:52.021 --> 00:59:53.623
WOULD THIS BE ESSENTIALLY A

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:55.758
SOLE SOURCE. TYPE OF

00:59:55.825 --> 00:59:57.226
APPROPRIATION AT SOME LATER

00:59:57.293 --> 00:59:59.896
POINT WHEN IT DOES HAPPEN- CAN

00:59:59.963 --> 01:00:01.631
YOU COMMENT ON THOSE TWO ITEMS

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:03.466
YES- THOUGH TWO POINT FIVE

01:00:03.533 --> 01:00:04.434
MILLION IN THE BILL HAS ALREADY

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.069
BEEN SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR SO

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:07.136
THE MONEY'S THERE HAS BEEN

01:00:07.203 --> 01:00:08.905
SIGNED SO FIRST QUESTION. THINK

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:09.772
TAKES CARE OF THE THIRD

01:00:09.839 --> 01:00:11.407
QUESTION TO THE SECOND QUESTION

01:00:11.474 --> 01:00:13.576
IS WHY SCRIPTS SO THIS IS A

01:00:13.643 --> 01:00:15.345
VERY PARTICULAR TYPE OF SCIENCE

01:00:15.411 --> 01:00:17.947
OF UNDERSTANDING WHY PLUS FEEL.

01:00:18.014 --> 01:00:19.582
SCRIPTURES ALREADY STARTED WITH

01:00:19.649 --> 01:00:21.985
LIGHTER STUDIES IN THIS AREA

01:00:22.051 --> 01:00:23.853
AND THE SCIENCE THAT WE DEVELOP

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.522
BEHIND LOVE FAILURES FOR THIS

01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:29.158
AREA. IS APPLICABLE STATE WIDE

01:00:29.225 --> 01:00:31.160
SO IT EVEN THOUGH IT'S YOU KNOW

01:00:31.227 --> 01:00:32.261
DOING IT FROM TORREY PINES

01:00:32.328 --> 01:00:36.099
OCEANSIDE IT IS- BE APPLICABLES

01:00:36.165 --> 01:00:37.734
STATEWIDE AND BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.268
DONE THE SCIENTIFIC WORKS OF

01:00:39.335 --> 01:00:41.170
THE COASTAL COMMISSION. DOESN'T

01:00:41.237 --> 01:00:43.973
DO SCIENTIFIC STUDIES OF- YOU

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.975
KNOW Q. PHYSICS AND ON THAT

01:00:46.042 --> 01:00:46.709
TYPE OF STUFF THAT'S WHAT

01:00:46.776 --> 01:00:48.745
SCRIPTS AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE

01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:49.345
USING SCRIPTS THEY'VE ALREADY

01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:50.680
DONE IT THEY HAVE THE KNOW HOW.

01:00:50.747 --> 01:00:52.715
AND THEY HAVE THE SCIENTISTS

01:00:52.782 --> 01:00:54.117
WHO CAN ACTUALLY DEVELOP THE

01:00:54.183 --> 01:00:55.485
SCIENCE BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN I

01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:56.686
WENT TO SCRIPT AND SAID I WANT

01:00:56.753 --> 01:00:57.553

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:09.265
AFTER THE FACT ONE OF THE FIELD

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:10.533
WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO PREDICT

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.935
IT. SO THAT'S THE FOR THE

01:01:13.002 --> 01:01:13.536

A LOT OF TIME AND MONEY FOCUSED

01:14:43.579 --> 01:14:45.280
ON HOW TO HELP FOLKS WHO ARE

EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND

01:14:46.915 --> 01:14:48.450
NOT ENOUGH TIME TO FOCUS ON HOW

01:14:48.517 --> 01:14:49.918
WE CAN PREVENT HOMELESSNESS IN

01:14:49.985 --> 01:14:51.153
FROM HAPPENING IN THE FIRST%

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:52.921

EVICTIONS ARE PLAYING A KEY

01:15:10.372 --> 01:15:12.241
ROLE IN DRIVING HOMELESSNESS

01:15:12.307 --> 01:15:13.542

THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL

01:15:38.634 --> 01:15:40.269
PROVIDES. WE ALSO KNOW FROM

01:15:40.335 --> 01:15:41.670
PREVIOUS LEGISLATION THAT THE

01:15:41.737 --> 01:15:43.205
LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED AND

FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR LEGAL

01:16:38.894 --> 01:16:41.396
SYSTEM. WE KNOW THAT 90% OF

THAT EVICTION PROCEEDINGS ARE

01:17:02.517 --> 01:17:04.519
MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE DECIDED.

01:17:04.586 --> 01:17:06.488
BASED ON THE FACTS AND THE LAW

01:17:06.555 --> 01:17:07.723
RATHER THAN SIMPLY ON THE

01:17:07.789 --> 01:17:09.091
ABILITY TO AFFORD AN ATTORNEY

01:17:09.157 --> 01:17:10.092

01:48:00.874 --> 01:48:02.609
NOTICED THAT IN THE OPPOSITION

01:48:02.676 --> 01:48:05.345
IT WAS FILED BY U. C. THEN THE

01:48:05.412 --> 01:48:07.214
OTHER PUBLIC EMPLOYEES SAY.

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:08.381

THINK. THERE'S A STRONG

01:48:40.947 --> 01:48:42.382
ARGUMENT THAT CURRENT LAW DOES

01:48:42.449 --> 01:48:44.317
PROTECT WORKERS FROM THIS

01:48:44.384 --> 01:48:46.319
EGREGIOUS PACTICE HAVING SAID

01:48:46.386 --> 01:48:48.955
THAT I THINK- CODIFYING THIS

01:48:49.022 --> 01:48:50.290
PRACTICE AND THIS NORMAN

01:48:50.357 --> 01:48:51.825
HOPEFULLY ALL OF THIS BILL ONLY

01:48:51.892 --> 01:48:53.793
SPEAKS. TO PUBLIC EMPLOYERS I

01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:55.795
WOULD HOPE THIS BECOMES THE

01:48:55.862 --> 01:48:57.297
NORM WITH EVEN PRIVATE

01:48:57.364 --> 01:48:58.899
EMPLOYERS IT IS JUST

01:48:58.965 --> 01:49:00.567
UNCONSCIONABLE AND WE'VE SEEN

01:49:00.634 --> 01:49:02.802
THIS- DURING THE PANDEMIC AS

01:49:02.869 --> 01:49:04.638
MANY SMALL. AND LARGE

01:49:04.704 --> 01:49:08.341
BUSINESSES- STRUGGLED TO ADAPT

01:49:08.408 --> 01:49:10.577
TO BASICALLY CHANGING

01:49:10.644 --> 01:49:12.913
CONDITIONS BY THE DAY. WE DON'T

01:49:12.979 --> 01:49:15.015
WANT SOMEBODY'S HEALTH CARE. TO

01:49:15.081 --> 01:49:16.917
GET LOST IN THE SHUFFLE. OF

01:49:16.983 --> 01:49:18.551

01:49:18.618 --> 01:49:20.921

HERE IN CALIFORNIA- THIS IS OUR

01:49:28.395 --> 01:49:29.462
EXPECTATION AND FOR THOSE

01:49:29.529 --> 01:49:31.965
REASONS I THINK IT IS A

01:49:32.032 --> 01:49:34.768
CRITICAL BILL EVEN IF- YOU SEE

01:49:34.834 --> 01:49:35.902

HAVEN'T HAD DIRECT

01:50:17.243 --> 01:50:19.112
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE- THE

01:50:19.179 --> 01:50:25.352
OPPOSITION. BUT I SEE TO WRITE-

01:50:25.418 --> 01:50:25.986
SENATOR ALSO YOU HAVE YOUR MIKE

01:50:26.052 --> 01:50:29.823
UP. YES THANK YOU- I'M REALLY

01:50:29.889 --> 01:50:31.725
GLAD THAT THE AUTHOR HAS

01:50:31.791 --> 01:50:35.195
INTRODUCED THIS BILL- THERE IS

01:50:35.261 --> 01:50:37.597
AN IMBALANCE CLEARLY AN

01:50:37.664 --> 01:50:40.233
IMBALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN

01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:41.368
WHETHER IT'S A PUBLIC OR

01:50:41.434 --> 01:50:43.470
PRIVATE EMPLOYER IN THIS CASE

01:50:43.536 --> 01:50:44.004
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC

01:50:44.070 --> 01:50:47.307
EMPLOYERS. WHERE IF THE

01:50:47.374 --> 01:50:49.109
EMPLOYEES THAT THEY WERE. THAT

01:50:49.175 --> 01:50:52.112
WORK FOR THEM WANT TO GO OUT ON

01:50:52.178 --> 01:50:54.614
STRIKE THEY HAVE TO. THEY HAVE

01:50:54.681 --> 01:50:57.484
TO CONSIDER EVERYTHING FROM

01:50:57.550 --> 01:50:59.152
WHETHER THEY'LL HAVE INCOME OR

01:50:59.219 --> 01:51:02.122
NOT HAVE INCOME. AND THE FACT

01:51:02.188 --> 01:51:03.123
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO FACE

01:51:03.189 --> 01:51:06.059
ALSO THE LOSS OF HEALTH CARE

01:51:06.126 --> 01:51:09.562
BECAUSE THE EMPLOYER WOULD STOP

01:51:09.629 --> 01:51:11.498
PAYING FOR THAT HEALTH CARE

01:51:11.564 --> 01:51:14.167
THAT IS NOT A PASSIVE DECISION

01:51:14.234 --> 01:51:17.437
THAT MAY BE. THIS IS A VERY

01:51:17.504 --> 01:51:19.472
SPECIFIC AND DELIBERATE

01:51:19.539 --> 01:51:23.410
DECISION. THAT WOULD BE MADE I

01:51:23.476 --> 01:51:25.812
SEE IN THE OPPOSITION COMMENTS-

01:51:25.879 --> 01:51:28.548
THAT THERE IS A BY THE

01:51:28.615 --> 01:51:29.682
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WHERE

01:51:29.749 --> 01:51:31.985
IT SAYS. YOU SEE CURRENTLY PAYS

01:51:32.052 --> 01:51:33.186
FOR COVERED HEALTH CARE COSTS

01:51:33.253 --> 01:51:35.288
DURING THE STRIKE AS LONG AS

01:51:35.355 --> 01:51:37.791
THE EMPLOYEE WORKS AT LEAST

01:51:37.857 --> 01:51:38.358
HALF THE HOURS WE MUST NOT A

01:51:38.425 --> 01:51:40.527
STRIKE. AND IF YOU'RE ON STRIKE

01:51:40.593 --> 01:51:42.529
YOU KNOW WORKING HALF THE HOURS

01:51:42.595 --> 01:51:47.367
SO CLEARLY THE POLICY OF UC AND

01:51:47.434 --> 01:51:48.935
IN THIS CASE I'M JUST REFERRING

01:51:49.002 --> 01:51:50.570
TO THEM BECAUSE OF THEIR

01:51:50.637 --> 01:51:53.106
RESPONSE. CLEARLY THEY'RE

01:51:53.173 --> 01:51:54.307
MAKING A DECISION THEY WOULD

01:51:54.374 --> 01:51:57.077
MAKE A DECISION TO NOT COVER

01:51:57.143 --> 01:51:59.012
HEALTH CARE DURING THE STRIKE.

01:51:59.079 --> 01:52:00.413
THEY'RE ALREADY THOSE EMPLOYEES

01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:02.982
ARE ALREADY HAVING TO FACE NO

01:52:03.049 --> 01:52:05.351
NOT HAVING ANY INCOME. AND THEN

01:52:05.418 --> 01:52:07.153
ON TOP OF THAT I THINK THIS

01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:09.856
IT'S AN ABUSE OF THE POWER- I

01:52:09.923 --> 01:52:12.025
THINK IT'S INHUMANE AND I'M

01:52:12.092 --> 01:52:15.428
REALLY GLAD TO SEE THAT- WE'RE

01:52:15.495 --> 01:52:18.431
ADDRESSING THIS NOW. FROM AND

01:52:18.498 --> 01:52:19.699
THE FACT THAT WHEN THEY SAY

01:52:19.766 --> 01:52:21.167
ALSO THAT THE UNIVERSITY DOES

01:52:21.234 --> 01:52:22.769
NOT IMPEDE AN EMPLOYEE'S RIGHT

01:52:22.836 --> 01:52:26.406
TO STRIKE. THE FACT ALL BY

01:52:26.473 --> 01:52:29.175
DENYING THEM ON BY ACTIVELY

01:52:29.242 --> 01:52:32.011
DECIDE DECIDING NOT TO PAY FOR

01:52:32.078 --> 01:52:34.147
THE HEALTH CARE THEY ARE THAT'S

01:52:34.214 --> 01:52:37.484
AN EXAMPLE OF IMPEDING THAT

01:52:37.550 --> 01:52:39.552
EMPLOYEES RIGHT TO STRIKE SO I

01:52:39.619 --> 01:52:42.155
AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS AND-

01:52:42.222 --> 01:52:44.190
I WOULD URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO

01:52:44.257 --> 01:52:46.559

LIVE WITH THAT CONDITION SINCE

01:54:15.148 --> 01:54:19.052

RELIANT ON THESE SERVICES

01:57:02.782 --> 01:57:03.883
THERE'S SIGNIFICANT DISPARITY

01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:05.251

THE PANDEMIC IT IS CLEAR THAT

01:57:21.768 --> 01:57:23.736
BIG MONOPOLIES HAVE BEEN ABLE

01:57:23.803 --> 01:57:24.537
TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS NEW

ECONOMIC REALITY. WHILE MANY

01:57:26.339 --> 01:57:27.340

BEEN FELT EVEN HARDER. BY ASIAN

01:57:42.121 --> 01:57:44.056
AND ASIAN OWNED BUSINESSES. IT

01:57:44.123 --> 01:57:45.558
IS CRITICAL WE PROVIDE THE

01:57:45.625 --> 01:57:47.660
NECESSARY TOOLS ARE PROTECTIONS

01:57:47.727 --> 01:57:48.661

ARE RAZOR THIN AND ADDING ON A

02:12:23.468 --> 02:12:24.903
2230% MARKETING CHARGE

02:12:24.970 --> 02:12:26.505
MARKETING CHARGE. REALLY HURTS

02:12:26.571 --> 02:12:28.173
BUSINESSES SO IN THE COURSE OF

02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:29.841
THIS BILL INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH

02:12:29.908 --> 02:12:30.942
YELP WHICH SUBMITTED A LETTER

02:12:31.009 --> 02:12:32.244
OF NEUTRALITY. ACTUALLY

02:12:32.311 --> 02:12:33.578
DISCONTINUED THE PRACTICE

02:12:33.645 --> 02:12:34.813
ALTOGETHER SO THE PRACTICE OF

02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:36.648
THE BILL IS. IS HOPING TO

02:12:36.715 --> 02:12:38.650
ENSURE THAT NO LONGER EXISTS IN

02:12:38.717 --> 02:12:40.018
THE REAL WORLD NOW. BECAUSE

02:12:40.085 --> 02:12:41.853
THEY UNDERSTAND IT IS SERIOUS

02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:43.088
BECAUSE THE REAL PART IS YOU

02:12:43.155 --> 02:12:44.423
KNOW A BUSINESS SHOULD HAVE THE

02:12:44.489 --> 02:12:45.590
ABILITY CONTRACT WITH AN OPEN

02:12:45.657 --> 02:12:47.526

02:12:47.592 --> 02:12:49.461
VENDORS AND THIRD PARTY APPS.

02:12:49.528 --> 02:12:50.262
BUT HE NEED TO BE KNOWING WHAT

02:12:50.329 --> 02:12:51.763
THEY'RE GETTING INTO. AND IN

02:12:51.830 --> 02:12:53.198
THE CASE OF CALL FORWARDING IS

02:12:53.265 --> 02:12:54.566
A PROBLEM WITH THE CONSUMER DID

02:12:54.633 --> 02:12:55.133
YOU KNOW THEY WERE CHARGING

02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:56.802
RESTAURANT AND THE RESTAURANT.

02:12:56.868 --> 02:12:57.903
WAS ENTIRELY UNDERSTANDING WHAT

02:12:57.969 --> 02:12:59.504
WAS HAPPENING. SO IF A

02:12:59.571 --> 02:13:00.739
RESTAURANT WANTS TO SPEAK

02:13:00.806 --> 02:13:02.074
WHAT'S HAPPENING THEY WOULD

02:13:02.140 --> 02:13:02.708

02:13:02.774 --> 02:13:04.810
CHARGE WHICH- AND I HAD TO READ

02:13:04.876 --> 02:13:05.944

PHONE ORDERS IT'S SUCH A HUGE

02:13:10.582 --> 02:13:11.817
PART OF THAT. IF YOU'RE A SMALL

02:13:11.883 --> 02:13:13.151

NOTE AS WELL AS I THINK

02:34:57.755 --> 02:34:59.390
IMPORTANT CONCERN RAISED BY THE

02:35:26.850 --> 02:35:28.986
CONCERN IS IT DOESN'T MAKE. A

02:35:29.053 --> 02:35:30.888
SENSE TO DO WE WHEN THERE MIGHT

02:35:30.954 --> 02:35:33.957
BE RESEARCH DONE UP BASED ON IT

02:35:34.024 --> 02:35:34.792
IS THAT ONE OF THEIR MAJOR

02:35:34.858 --> 02:35:36.827
CONCERNS I THINK THAT THEY HAVE

02:35:36.894 --> 02:35:38.829
A NUMBER OF CONCERNS THAT- I

02:35:38.896 --> 02:35:40.364
DON'T THINK IT'S JUST LIMITED

02:35:40.431 --> 02:35:42.299
TO THAT. IN A IN A BROAD SENSE

02:35:42.366 --> 02:35:43.567
STATED HE COLLECTED SOME OF

02:35:43.634 --> 02:35:45.235
THEIR OWN DATA- WHICH IS

02:35:45.302 --> 02:35:45.969
SEPARATE FROM DATA THAT THERE

02:35:46.036 --> 02:35:47.871
MAY BE BORROWING HI I JUST KNOW

02:35:47.938 --> 02:35:50.474

AGO. IN THE COLLECTION OF DATA

02:35:58.415 --> 02:36:00.784
REALLY ALLOW THE POINT TO BE

02:36:00.851 --> 02:36:04.521
PROVEN ON HIV AND SO OUR VOTE

02:36:04.588 --> 02:36:06.523
TO MOVE THE BILL BUT I HOPE YOU

02:36:06.590 --> 02:36:07.991
WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT

02:36:08.058 --> 02:36:14.865

DISTANCES MIGHT BE IT'S NOT

02:36:29.947 --> 02:36:31.148
INSURMOUNTABLE I THINK THAT

02:36:31.215 --> 02:36:32.616

02:36:42.192 --> 02:36:43.594

02:36:55.439 --> 02:36:57.708
TODAY I HAD AN INTERESTING BUT

02:36:57.775 --> 02:36:59.843
I. HEAR THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON

02:36:59.910 --> 02:37:01.812
SOMEONE TO BE SUPPORTIVE HERE'S

02:37:01.879 --> 02:37:04.248
HERE'S THE CHALLENGE THAT I

02:37:04.314 --> 02:37:06.984
HAVE AND IT'S- I'M REALLY

02:37:07.050 --> 02:37:09.953
CONCERNED WITH US GETTING. DATA

02:37:10.020 --> 02:37:12.022
THAT HELPS US TO DETERMINE HOW

02:37:12.089 --> 02:37:14.591
WE CAN. SLOW DOWN THE VIRUSES

02:37:14.658 --> 02:37:16.527
IT'S COMING IN THE FUTURE AND

02:37:16.593 --> 02:37:18.962
THERE WAS DATA THAT WE DID NOT

02:37:19.029 --> 02:37:22.199
COLLECT. IN DURING THAT THE

02:37:22.266 --> 02:37:25.402
PEAKER AS THIS. AS THIS VIRUS

02:37:25.469 --> 02:37:27.471
IS ROLLING OUT THAT I THINK

02:37:27.538 --> 02:37:29.306
WOULD HAVE TOLD US. WHERE WE

02:37:29.373 --> 02:37:30.808
WERE WE WOULD FIND THAT THE

02:37:30.874 --> 02:37:33.977
BIGGEST INFECTIONS- NUMBER ONE

02:37:34.044 --> 02:37:36.380
IS WE DIDN'T. WE DIDN'T SK

02:37:36.446 --> 02:37:37.981
PEOPLE WHERE THEY WORKED AND

02:37:38.048 --> 02:37:40.751
WHAT KIND OF WORK THEYDID- AND

02:37:40.818 --> 02:37:43.220
WE DIDN'T ASK THEM- WHAT KIND

02:37:43.287 --> 02:37:45.856
WHAT THEIR LIVING SITUATION WAS

02:37:45.923 --> 02:37:48.192
WAS WAS LIKE IN OTHER WORDS. IF

02:37:48.258 --> 02:37:49.326
WE'RE GOING TO SEND THEM HOME

02:37:49.393 --> 02:37:50.661
TO QUARANTINE HOW MANY OTHER

02:37:50.727 --> 02:37:51.895
PEOPLE WERE LIVING IN THE SPACE

02:37:51.962 --> 02:37:53.130
AND WHAT WHAT WHAT WAS THE

02:37:53.197 --> 02:37:55.065
SPACE WHAT DID IT LOOK LIKE.

02:37:55.132 --> 02:37:57.734
AND EARLY ON WHEN WE WERE ALL

02:37:57.801 --> 02:37:59.303
SENT HOME IT WAS VERY CLEAR TO

02:37:59.369 --> 02:38:00.804
ME THAT IF THIS. WAS A

02:38:00.871 --> 02:38:02.739
TRANSMISSION TRANSMISSIBLE

02:38:02.806 --> 02:38:07.377
DISEASE THAT WAS CARRIED- IN IN

02:38:07.444 --> 02:38:10.314
THE AIR THAT TELLING PEOPLE TO

02:38:10.380 --> 02:38:14.818
GO HOME. WHEN THERE WERE TEN

02:38:14.885 --> 02:38:15.385
PEOPLE LIVING IN A THOUSAND

02:38:15.452 --> 02:38:18.388
SQUARE FOOT. APARTMENT WHAT'S

02:38:18.455 --> 02:38:20.224
NOT GOING TO BE A GOOD THING

02:38:20.290 --> 02:38:23.026
AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT I THINK

02:38:23.093 --> 02:38:25.462
THAT THAT WE REALLY NEED THE

02:38:25.529 --> 02:38:26.730
DATA BECOMES REALLY CRITICALLY

02:38:26.797 --> 02:38:28.632
IMPORTANT AND I DON'T. WE'RE

02:38:28.699 --> 02:38:29.666
GONNA HOLD EMPLOYERS

02:38:29.733 --> 02:38:31.802
RESPONSIBLE IF THEIR EMPLOYEES

02:38:31.869 --> 02:38:33.537
ARE GETTING SICK AND DYING BUT

02:38:33.604 --> 02:38:35.172
THEY MAY GO BACK TO A NUMBER OF

02:38:35.239 --> 02:38:36.707
DIFFERENT COMPANIES AND THEN IN

02:38:36.773 --> 02:38:37.541
THOSE COUNTIES WE WEREN'T

02:38:37.608 --> 02:38:39.476
ASKING YOU KNOW FOR YOU WORKING

02:38:39.543 --> 02:38:41.111
WHAT KIND OF YOU'RE WORKING IN

02:38:41.178 --> 02:38:42.746
A MEAT PACKING FACILITY OR

02:38:42.813 --> 02:38:44.615
YOU'RE WORKING IN A- SOLID FOR

02:38:44.681 --> 02:38:45.916
THIS FACILITY WITH PEOPLE

02:38:45.983 --> 02:38:48.118
SHOULDER TO SHOULDER- WITHOUT

02:38:48.185 --> 02:38:50.153
MASKS. THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF

02:38:50.220 --> 02:38:52.689
THINGS THAT THAT I THINK WE- IF

02:38:52.756 --> 02:38:55.692
WE HAD. IF WE HAD DONE THE KIND

02:38:55.759 --> 02:38:57.494
OF CONTRACT TRACING THAT I

02:38:57.561 --> 02:38:58.095
THINK WE NEED TO DO THAT WOULD

02:38:58.161 --> 02:39:01.932
HAVE BEEN. ITALY-

02:39:01.999 --> 02:39:03.734
UNDERSTANDABLE FROM A

02:39:03.800 --> 02:39:05.402
CONTAGIOUS CONTAGION

02:39:05.469 --> 02:39:07.037
PERSPECTIVE SO I WANT TO MAKE

02:39:07.104 --> 02:39:08.105
SURE THAT WHATEVER WE'RE DOING

02:39:08.171 --> 02:39:10.774
HERE DOES NOT IMPEDE RESEARCH

02:39:10.841 --> 02:39:12.075
IF WE GO BACK AND WE START

02:39:12.142 --> 02:39:13.877
SAYING OKAY WHAT WHAT COULD WE

02:39:13.944 --> 02:39:14.544
HAVE LEARNED FROM THE DATA THAT

DISAGGREGATED IN A PUBLIC

02:39:22.653 --> 02:39:23.854
SPHERE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN DO

02:39:23.921 --> 02:39:25.289

COLLEAGUES HAVE SPECIALLY

02:40:46.703 --> 02:40:57.881
INJURED DISH. AND I'VE TRIED TO

02:40:57.948 --> 02:40:59.516
DO FOR THAT. BECAUSE IT REALLY

02:40:59.583 --> 02:41:00.717
IS I CAN'T ALLOW FOR THE FULL

02:41:00.784 --> 02:41:01.785
X. IN COMMODITIES A OF INFOR.

ON NO CAN YOU. ALLOW THE

02:41:03.820 --> 02:41:05.822
PENDULUM TO SWING TOO FAR

02:41:05.889 --> 02:41:07.958
WHERE. ESSENTIAL INFORMATION IS

02:41:08.025 --> 02:41:11.928
NOT AT. DISPOSABLE AT THE

02:41:11.995 --> 02:41:14.698
DISPOSAL OF INDIVIDUALS- THAT

02:41:14.765 --> 02:41:17.067
NEEDED AND I'M I'M CONCERNED

02:41:17.134 --> 02:41:19.169
AND I VOTED FOR A NUMBER OF

02:41:19.236 --> 02:41:22.072
YOUR ITEMS BEFORE THIS ONE I'M

02:41:22.139 --> 02:41:24.174
I'M CONCERNED GOES A LITTLE BIT

02:41:24.241 --> 02:41:27.344
TOO FAR. AND I KNOW THAT THERE

02:41:27.411 --> 02:41:29.046
ARE MOMENTS IN CONVERSATION

02:41:29.112 --> 02:41:31.882
STILL ON GOING. BUT I HAVE TO

02:41:31.948 --> 02:41:36.186
KIND OF GO BACK TO MARCH OF

02:41:36.253 --> 02:41:37.054
TWENTY TWENTY. WHERE SOMETHING

02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:38.755
NEW HAPPENS AND WE SPENT THE

02:41:38.822 --> 02:41:42.592
NEXT. SIX MONTHS NINE MONTHS

02:41:42.659 --> 02:41:43.026
TRYING TO ACCUMULATE

02:41:43.093 --> 02:41:45.929
INFORMATION. IN LEARN AS

02:41:45.996 --> 02:41:47.864
QUICKLY AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE

02:41:47.931 --> 02:41:52.636
WHAT THIS VIRUS WAS ABOUT AND I

02:41:52.702 --> 02:41:54.271
THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SALINAS

02:41:54.337 --> 02:41:57.574
EVEN IDENTIFIED THAT- WE HAD

02:41:57.641 --> 02:42:00.310
MAJOR FAILURES AT THE LOCAL

02:42:00.377 --> 02:42:02.112
LEVEL WHEN IT CAME TO CONTACT

02:42:02.179 --> 02:42:04.848
TRACING BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS WHO

02:42:04.915 --> 02:42:06.083
DIDN'T WANT TO DISCLOSE THE

02:42:06.149 --> 02:42:07.818
INFORMATION AND YOU COULDN'T BY

02:42:07.884 --> 02:42:09.986
FORCE OF LAW ANOTHER MEANS

02:42:10.053 --> 02:42:10.954
PRODUCE THAT FOR SOME PRODUCE

02:42:11.021 --> 02:42:13.323
THAT. AND WE ALSO DIDN'T HAVE

02:42:13.390 --> 02:42:15.158
THE FOLLOW THROUGH OF PLACES OF

02:42:15.225 --> 02:42:18.095
EMPLOYMENT AND CO HABITATION

02:42:18.161 --> 02:42:19.396
AND ALL THAT WENT ALONG WITH

02:42:19.463 --> 02:42:22.199
THAT SO. WE NOW HAVE A NEW

02:42:22.265 --> 02:42:26.169
VARIANT THAT IS APPARENTLY MORE

02:42:26.236 --> 02:42:28.772
CONTAGIOUS. THAN ON THE

02:42:28.839 --> 02:42:30.974
ORIGINAL THAT WAS INTRODUCED.

02:42:31.041 --> 02:42:33.176
INTO THE U. S. YEAR AND A HALF

02:42:33.243 --> 02:42:37.180
AGO. AND I JUST BEEN TRYING TO

02:42:37.247 --> 02:42:39.783
WRAP MY ARMS AROUND WHY WE

02:42:39.850 --> 02:42:40.650
WOULD BE RESTRICTING

02:42:40.717 --> 02:42:42.953
INFORMATION IF SAFEGUARDS CAN

02:42:43.019 --> 02:42:45.255
BE PUT INTO PLACE IN LEGAL

02:42:45.322 --> 02:42:46.990
MEASURES CAN BE PUT INTO PLACE

02:42:47.057 --> 02:42:49.359
THAT WOULD DISALLOW THE ABUSE

02:42:49.426 --> 02:42:51.394
AND MISUSE OF THAT INFORMATION.

02:42:51.461 --> 02:42:52.729
NOW YOUR TICKET LATE UNIVERSITY

02:42:52.796 --> 02:42:56.032
CALIFORNIA AS BEING AN ENTITY

02:42:56.099 --> 02:42:57.200
THROUGH WHICH A LOT OF THESE

02:42:57.267 --> 02:43:00.403
NEGOTIATIONS ARE OUR ON GOING.

02:43:00.470 --> 02:43:02.172
BUT THERE'S PLENTY OF PRIVATE

02:43:02.239 --> 02:43:03.573
RESEARCH ENTITIES THAT ARE NOT

02:43:03.640 --> 02:43:06.676
AFFILIATED WITH UNIVERSITIES

02:43:06.743 --> 02:43:08.378
THAT ARE GOING TO NEED THIS.

02:43:08.445 --> 02:43:09.713
AND A LOT F THESE

02:43:09.779 --> 02:43:12.115
ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD HAVE

02:43:12.182 --> 02:43:15.085
COMPLETE ACCESS. OR MORE FREE

02:43:15.152 --> 02:43:17.354
ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION.

02:43:17.420 --> 02:43:19.189
MAYBE THE SEGREGATION IS THE

02:43:19.256 --> 02:43:21.758
WAY THAT HE CAN BE MAINTAINED

02:43:21.825 --> 02:43:25.262
WHILE IDENTITIES ARE PROTECTED-

02:43:25.328 --> 02:43:28.565
BUT I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT WE

02:43:28.632 --> 02:43:29.766
ARE ALLOWING THE PRIVACY

02:43:29.833 --> 02:43:34.971
ARGUMENT. TO OVERWHELM US WHEN

02:43:35.038 --> 02:43:37.073
WE ARE STILL IN THE MIDST OF A

02:43:37.140 --> 02:43:40.110
PANDEMIC WITH THE NEW VARIANT

02:43:40.177 --> 02:43:44.314
ON THE STAGE. AND SO I THINK

02:43:44.381 --> 02:43:46.383
YOU KNOW ONE OF THOSE CONCERNS

02:43:46.449 --> 02:43:48.151
SO FOR EXAMPLE VACCINATION

02:43:48.218 --> 02:43:51.121
STATUS. NOW IS THAT CAN YOU CAN

02:43:51.188 --> 02:43:54.157
YOU ARTICULATE OR CONFIRM THAT

02:43:54.224 --> 02:43:56.927
VACCINATION STATUS IS A PIECE

02:43:56.993 --> 02:43:59.029
OF INFORMATION THAT WILL. B.

02:43:59.095 --> 02:44:01.765
DEEMS RECOVERABLE OR WOULD THAT

02:44:01.831 --> 02:44:03.500
NEED TO BE DELETED. IN THE

02:44:03.567 --> 02:44:06.303
SIXTY DAYS AS WELL. THANKS FOR

02:44:06.369 --> 02:44:07.337
THE QUESTION CENTER WERE JUST

02:44:07.404 --> 02:44:09.906
THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT VACCINES

02:44:09.973 --> 02:44:10.507
THERE IS NOT THE WORD VACCINE

02:44:10.574 --> 02:44:15.946
IN THE BILL. SORT OF BORED JUST

02:44:16.012 --> 02:44:17.280
AS THAT RESPOND YOUR QUESTION

02:44:17.347 --> 02:44:19.082
I'M NOT I'M NOT I'M NOT CERTAIN

02:44:19.149 --> 02:44:24.688
IT DOES- IN TERMS OF. WHETHER

02:44:24.754 --> 02:44:26.856
OR NOT SOMEONE STATUS AS HAVING

02:44:26.923 --> 02:44:30.627
BEEN SICK OR NOT. WHETHER IT BE

02:44:30.694 --> 02:44:32.062
THROUGH THE PANDEMIC OR THROUGH

02:44:32.128 --> 02:44:35.432
ANY OTHER. ACTUATION IS THEIR

02:44:35.498 --> 02:44:37.100
STATUS CONSIDER PROTECTED

02:44:37.167 --> 02:44:39.803
PRIVACY MATTERS OR WOULD THAT

02:44:39.869 --> 02:44:43.206
BE MAINTAINED IN. THE EXAM TWO

02:44:43.273 --> 02:44:47.978
CATEGORIES. SOME I'M NOT. I'M

02:44:48.044 --> 02:44:54.718
NOT SURE IF- YOU KNOW IT IF WE

02:44:54.784 --> 02:44:56.286
JUST GO BACK TO WHAT THE BILL

02:44:56.353 --> 02:44:58.321
IS ATTEMPTING TO DO IT'S

02:44:58.388 --> 02:44:59.723
PROHIBITING EMPLOYEES OF LAW

02:44:59.789 --> 02:45:00.824
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND

02:45:00.890 --> 02:45:02.092
CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS FROM

02:45:02.158 --> 02:45:04.027
CONDUCTING CONTACT TRACING AND

02:45:04.094 --> 02:45:06.329
IT ALSO PROHIBITS THAT DATA

02:45:06.396 --> 02:45:08.965
THAT IS COLLECTED- AND RECEIVED

02:45:09.032 --> 02:45:10.533
HER PREPARED FOR CONTACT TRICKS

02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:12.135
TREATING PURPOSES FROM BEING

02:45:12.202 --> 02:45:14.471
USED OR DISCLOSED FOR OTHER

02:45:14.537 --> 02:45:17.240
PURPOSES THEN CONTACT TRACING

02:45:17.307 --> 02:45:20.043
ITSELF IT DOES OF COURSE HAVE

02:45:20.110 --> 02:45:22.178
THE EXEMPTIONS FOR THE RESEARCH

02:45:22.245 --> 02:45:24.614
WHICH WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT-

02:45:24.681 --> 02:45:26.082
SO IT'S INFORMATION COLLECTED

02:45:26.149 --> 02:45:29.452
IN CONTACT TRACING- SAID I

02:45:29.519 --> 02:45:30.620
DON'T I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW

02:45:30.687 --> 02:45:31.855
FROM A PEOPLE POWER PERSPECTIVE

02:45:31.921 --> 02:45:33.323
WHICH I THINK WE ALL WERE VERY

02:45:33.390 --> 02:45:34.658
CONCERNED EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC

02:45:34.724 --> 02:45:36.059
IF WE'RE DOING A CONTACT PERSON

02:45:36.126 --> 02:45:37.861
THAT WE NEEDED TO DO- IF THERE

02:45:37.927 --> 02:45:39.896
IS A UNIFORM WAY. THAT THAT WAS

02:45:39.963 --> 02:45:43.933
HAPPENING ACROSS COUNTIES- SO

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:44.567
I'M NOT SURE WHAT DATA IS BEING

02:45:44.634 --> 02:45:46.736

NETWORK OF INFORMATION. THAT'S

02:46:46.129 --> 02:46:46.563

TO PRODUCE A REPORT THAT

02:47:09.819 --> 02:47:12.088
IDENTIFIES TRENDS. THAT ALLOW

03:34:07.668 --> 03:34:09.736
PROSECUTOR COULD THREATEN LOCAL

03:34:09.803 --> 03:34:10.737

SCREAMING IN FACT BE PUNISHED

03:34:30.224 --> 03:34:31.758
WITH BULLS BECAUSE THE

03:34:31.825 --> 03:34:32.793
LEGISLATURE ELECTED TO GIVE

03:34:32.859 --> 03:34:34.895
THIS POWER THE PROSECUTORS AND

03:34:34.962 --> 03:34:36.496
COURTS. PROSECUTORS SHOULD

03:34:36.563 --> 03:34:37.731

FOR THE COST OF ENFORCING THE

03:34:45.739 --> 03:34:47.207
LAW. WE BELIEVE THE LAW

03:34:47.274 --> 03:34:48.408
ENFORCEMENT FUNCTIONS SHOULD BE

03:34:48.475 --> 03:34:50.210
FUNDED FROM STATE AND LOCAL

03:34:50.277 --> 03:34:52.379
GOVERNMENTS BUDGETS. NOT FROM

03:34:52.446 --> 03:34:54.848
FINES LEVIED BY THE SAME LAW

03:34:54.915 --> 03:34:56.149
ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. WE KNOW

03:34:56.216 --> 03:34:57.084
FROM HISTORY ABOUT THE

FORFEITURE THAT WHEN AN AGENCY

03:34:58.151 --> 03:35:00.153
MAY LEGALLY PROFIT FROM THE

03:35:00.220 --> 03:35:02.155
TYPE OF ENFORCEMENT. THAT SOME

03:35:02.222 --> 03:35:03.457
AGENCIES NOT ALL BUT SOME WILL

03:35:03.523 --> 03:35:05.158
INEVITABLY DIVERT RESOURCES

03:35:09.896 --> 03:35:10.397
PROVIDE A LITTLE EXTRA TO BE

03:35:10.464 --> 03:35:11.632
ABLE TO COME. THIS IS A

03:35:11.698 --> 03:35:13.267
MISTAKE. THERE'S NO EVIDENCE

03:35:13.333 --> 03:35:15.002
THAT INCENTIVIZING PROSECUTIONS

03:35:15.068 --> 03:35:16.770

03:40:54.140 --> 03:40:57.010
TAXES ON THIS. INDUSTRY THAT IT

03:40:57.077 --> 03:40:59.179
HELPS IN SOME WAYS FUEL AN

03:40:59.245 --> 03:41:02.148
ILLICIT MARKET- AND APART FROM

03:41:02.215 --> 03:41:03.450
THE TAXES THAT THEY'RE PAYING I

03:41:03.516 --> 03:41:04.284
THINK IT'S- BETWEEN THE

03:41:04.351 --> 03:41:06.686
CULTIVATION AND USE TAXES LIKE

03:41:06.753 --> 03:41:07.854
TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. PLUS ANY

03:41:07.921 --> 03:41:09.723
LOCAL TAXES. BEST OF ALL SORTS

03:41:09.789 --> 03:41:10.991
OF SECURITY AND OTHER

03:41:11.057 --> 03:41:11.758
REQUIREMENTS IT'S VERY

03:41:11.825 --> 03:41:13.893
EXPENSIVE. AND FOR THE BIG

03:41:13.960 --> 03:41:16.863
OPERATORS THEY CAN ABSORB THAT.

03:41:16.930 --> 03:41:17.764
BUT FOR THE ESPECIALLY THE

03:41:17.831 --> 03:41:19.899
SMALL LOCAL OPERATORS WITH A

03:41:19.966 --> 03:41:20.934
LOT OF THEM IN SAN FRANCISCO

03:41:21.001 --> 03:41:22.535

03:41:22.602 --> 03:41:24.638
TOO AS WELL. THEY HAVE YOU KNOW

03:41:24.704 --> 03:41:25.839
THEY'RE REALLY STRUGGLING TO

03:41:25.905 --> 03:41:27.807
SURVIVE AND- WE HAVE AN EQUITY

03:41:27.874 --> 03:41:29.743

03:41:29.809 --> 03:41:32.245
FOLKS WE'VE- IT'S BEEN GREAT TO

03:41:32.312 --> 03:41:33.980
GET INTO. WHO WHO SUFFERED THE

03:41:34.047 --> 03:41:35.815
MOST DURING THE PROHIBITION. ON

MAKE SURE THEY CAN- PARTAKE IN

03:41:39.853 --> 03:41:41.921
THE LEGAL BUSINESS- AND IT'S

03:41:41.988 --> 03:41:43.456
REALLY UNFAIR. WHEN THEY ARE

03:41:43.523 --> 03:41:45.358
BEING UNDERMINED. BY THESE

03:41:45.425 --> 03:41:47.227
ILLEGAL OPERATIONS AS A LOT OF

03:41:47.293 --> 03:41:48.228
THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO WE

03:41:48.294 --> 03:41:50.964

CALIFORNIA- BUT THIS IS ONE

03:41:58.938 --> 03:42:04.944
APPROACH AND SOME HAPPY. TO

APPRECIATE SENATOR WIENER'S

03:42:11.785 --> 03:42:14.020
COMMENTS AND I WANT TO ADD ONE

03:42:14.087 --> 03:42:16.823
THING AND THE- THERE IS AN

03:42:16.890 --> 03:42:19.325
ISSUE GOING ON ARE WE AS A

03:42:19.392 --> 03:42:21.227
LEGISLATURE DECIDING WHETHER OR

03:42:21.294 --> 03:42:22.929
NOT TO EXTEND THE PROVISIONAL

03:42:22.996 --> 03:42:25.632
LICENSES ARE LOCKED AT SUNSET.

03:42:25.699 --> 03:42:27.200
AND THEN THERE ARE CERTAIN

03:42:27.267 --> 03:42:29.569
COUNTY STATE CAN'T PROCESS ANY

03:42:29.636 --> 03:42:32.072
OF THE PERMITS IN ANY EXPEDITED

03:42:32.138 --> 03:42:35.675
WAY. AND WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF

03:42:35.742 --> 03:42:38.378
KICKING PEOPLE OUT WHEN WE NEED

03:42:38.445 --> 03:42:39.913
TO GET THE MAN AND WE NEED TO

03:42:39.979 --> 03:42:42.015
ELIMINATE THE BLACK MARKET AND

03:42:42.082 --> 03:42:42.816
THERE'S ONE PARTICULAR CASE IN

03:42:42.882 --> 03:42:45.485
POINT. WHICH IS MONTEREY COUNTY

03:42:45.552 --> 03:42:47.320
WHICH SENATOR CAFIERO AND I

03:42:47.387 --> 03:42:52.358
SHARE. AND THERE WAS A

03:42:52.425 --> 03:42:53.693
OF SUPERVISORS THAT YOU COULD

03:42:53.760 --> 03:42:55.061
ONLY DO THE GROSS AND

03:42:55.128 --> 03:42:57.764
GREENHOUSES AND IF YOU HAPPEN

03:42:57.831 --> 03:43:02.535
TO BE ONE OF THE- LEGACY

03:43:02.602 --> 03:43:04.471
FARMERS IN BIG SUR THAT'VE BEEN

03:43:04.537 --> 03:43:07.307
THERE FOREVER. THEY DON'T HAVE

03:43:07.373 --> 03:43:09.175
GREENHOUSES THEY CAN'T COME IN

03:43:09.242 --> 03:43:11.344
AND THEY'VE JUST MODERATED THIS

03:43:11.411 --> 03:43:12.479
REQUIREMENT IN THE LAST FEW

03:43:12.545 --> 03:43:14.280
MONTHS AND PEOPLE ARE STARTING

03:43:14.347 --> 03:43:15.482
TO STRUGGLE TO GET THEIR

03:43:15.548 --> 03:43:19.119
LICENSE BUT- IF WE SUNSET THE

03:43:19.185 --> 03:43:21.121
PROVISIONAL IT MIGHT SUNSET THE

03:43:21.187 --> 03:43:23.123
ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO COME IN TO

03:43:23.189 --> 03:43:25.158
THE LEGAL POINTS THAT WE WANT

03:43:25.225 --> 03:43:27.827
THEM ALL TO BE. BANNED SO

03:43:27.894 --> 03:43:29.662
ENORMOUS SUPPORT THIS BILL AND

03:43:29.729 --> 03:43:31.164
ITIS THE RIGHT DIRECTION

03:43:31.231 --> 03:43:33.566
BECAUSE THE REAL QUESTION IS.

03:43:33.633 --> 03:43:35.668
IS DO IT PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR

03:43:35.735 --> 03:43:38.605
PEOPLE TO BE LEGAL AS OPPOSED

03:43:38.671 --> 03:43:40.607
OTHERWISE I THINK WE JUST HAVE

03:43:40.673 --> 03:43:41.741
TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE IF WE

03:43:41.808 --> 03:43:43.309
DON'T DO OTHER THINGS WERE

03:43:43.376 --> 03:43:44.344
PUSHING PEOPLE OUT OF THE

03:43:44.410 --> 03:43:46.279
SYSTEM AND THEN PICKING UP IN

03:43:46.346 --> 03:43:49.215

03:43:51.050 --> 03:43:54.521
THIS IS A COMPLEX ISSUE WITH

03:43:54.587 --> 03:43:55.622

FROM WHERE I WAS SITTING I

03:44:11.538 --> 03:44:12.338
THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS A

03:44:12.405 --> 03:44:14.374
HORRIBLE IDEA BECAUSE HE COULD.

03:44:14.440 --> 03:44:16.442
PRESSURE PEOPLE INTO TAKING A

03:44:16.509 --> 03:44:18.444

THAT THIS FINDING STUDENTS

03:47:06.479 --> 03:47:08.715

PEOPLE OF COLOR. MR HAVE

03:47:14.587 --> 03:47:15.655
ANOTHER QUESTION AT THE

03:47:33.206 --> 03:47:35.842
MY CONCERN WITH THE OPPOSITION

03:47:35.908 --> 03:47:37.944
CONTINUING ON WITH THAT IS THAT

03:47:38.011 --> 03:47:40.013
THIS AIDING AND ABETTING. ONE

03:47:40.079 --> 03:47:41.614
OF THE FACTORS ARE OUTLINED ON

03:47:41.681 --> 03:47:44.784
PAGE SEVEN OF OUR STAFF REPORTS

03:48:02.068 --> 03:48:04.037
UNDER THE NETWORK. IT SEEMS

FROM UNDERSTANDING THE FOURTH

03:49:12.872 --> 03:49:14.173
FACTOR THAT'S SUPPOSED TO

EMPLOYEES. IS THE IS THE

03:49:36.129 --> 03:49:38.131
CONCERN OF THE OPPOSITION THAT

03:49:38.197 --> 03:49:40.967
THAT THAT MAY GET THE CITY

03:49:41.033 --> 03:49:44.704
ATTORNEY- EVIDENCE THAT THEY

03:49:44.770 --> 03:49:46.472
WERE VERY HALF OF THE EMPLOYEES

03:49:46.539 --> 03:49:47.940
SAID THEY WOULD BECOME. THEY

03:49:48.007 --> 03:49:49.208
WOULD SIGNIFICANT FURTHER THE

03:49:49.275 --> 03:49:51.811
ON LICENSING- CANVAS ACTIVITY

03:49:51.878 --> 03:49:53.079
VERSUS THE PERSON WORKS FOR A

03:49:53.146 --> 03:49:54.814
BIGGER FIRM WOULDN'T BE.

03:49:54.881 --> 03:49:56.782
CAPTURED IS TAT BECAUSE THAT'S

03:49:56.849 --> 03:49:58.484
THAT'S CORRECTABLE LIGHTING.

03:49:58.551 --> 03:50:01.854
IT'S THE I DON'T THINK THAT'S

03:50:01.921 --> 03:50:05.958
WHAT THE WHAT THE THIRD. YES

03:50:06.025 --> 03:50:10.062
MISS PARKER'S RESPONSE. DON'T

OF THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO AND

03:50:13.599 --> 03:50:14.133
ANY ACTIVE SHOOTER OKAY SO YOU

03:50:14.200 --> 03:50:16.269
AS WELL. THERE'S NO DEFINITION

03:50:16.335 --> 03:50:16.936
THE BILL ON THE SIDE THE

03:50:17.003 --> 03:50:19.305
OPERATION ON THE AMOUNT OF

03:50:19.372 --> 03:50:23.709
MONEY TRADERS. SO I THINK A LOT

03:50:23.776 --> 03:50:26.379
OF GOING DOWN TO ADDRESS

03:50:26.445 --> 03:50:27.213
CONCERNS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO

03:50:27.280 --> 03:50:29.048
SIMPLY ARE ARE WORKING IN A

03:50:29.115 --> 03:50:30.249
STORE THAT THEY MAY OR MAY NOT

03:50:30.316 --> 03:50:32.718
KNOW WHICH PHONE LICENSE BUT

03:50:32.785 --> 03:50:36.222
THEY'RE STILL- WHICH ROOM FOR.

03:50:36.289 --> 03:50:37.423
FORD BECAUSE WE'LL BE USING

03:50:37.490 --> 03:50:39.425
EXACTLY THE POINT OF THE

03:50:39.492 --> 03:50:41.027
BUILDERS TO INCENTIVIZE MORE.

03:50:41.093 --> 03:50:42.662
PUNISHMENT INCENTIVIZE MORE

03:50:42.728 --> 03:50:44.263
ENFORCEMENT BY MAKING THE

FOR REIMBURSEMENT TO THE- THAT

03:50:49.936 --> 03:50:51.103
BRINGS THE ACTION. SO THAT IS

03:50:51.170 --> 03:50:52.538
THE PURPOSE IS TO INCREASE THE

03:50:52.605 --> 03:50:54.240
NUMBER OF ENFORCEMENT AND WE'RE

03:50:54.307 --> 03:50:55.841
CONCERNED THAT IT WILL GET EVEN

03:50:55.908 --> 03:50:58.978
SMALL OPERATORS ARE SMALL- LOW

CANNOT BE EDUCATED AND IT'S NOT

03:51:03.583 --> 03:51:05.017
THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE GOAL

03:51:05.084 --> 03:51:07.486

STONE- FOR AUTHORING A J. R.

04:32:46.116 --> 04:32:48.685
TWELVE. I THINK THE INDIVIDUAL

04:32:48.752 --> 04:32:50.620
THAT SPOKE A MOMENT AGO AND I

04:32:50.687 --> 04:32:52.656
HAD OCCASION TO READ AN EMAIL

04:32:52.723 --> 04:32:56.093
THAT HE SENT OUT- HAS BEEN VERY

04:32:56.159 --> 04:32:57.461
SELECTIVE IN FRANKLY

04:32:57.527 --> 04:33:00.697
DISINGENUOUS. ABOUT THE MOTIVES

04:33:00.764 --> 04:33:03.600
IN REPRESENTATIONS ON THE VALUE

04:33:03.667 --> 04:33:04.901
THE CALIFORNIA ACCREDITED LAW

04:33:04.968 --> 04:33:06.670
SCHOOLS HAVE TO OUR MILITARY

04:33:06.737 --> 04:33:10.040
COMMUNITY. MANY OF YOU KNOW

04:33:10.107 --> 04:33:12.709
THAT FOLKS IN THE MILITARY.

04:33:12.776 --> 04:33:15.011
FOUR OUT OF THE MILITARY I HAVE

04:33:15.078 --> 04:33:17.447
TO RESIDE. IN PLACES WHERE

04:33:17.514 --> 04:33:18.615
THERE MAY NOT BE AN ABA

04:33:18.682 --> 04:33:20.784
ACCREDITED LAW SCHOOL. AND I

04:33:20.851 --> 04:33:23.153
JUST TALK ABOUT MONTEREY OR

04:33:23.220 --> 04:33:25.122
FRESNO OR A LOT OF THESE OTHER

04:33:25.188 --> 04:33:26.857
PLACES ESPECIALLY RURAL

04:33:26.923 --> 04:33:29.259
COMMUNITIES WHERE THAT LEGAL

04:33:29.326 --> 04:33:31.795
EDUCATION CAN ONLY BE GOTTEN-

04:33:31.862 --> 04:33:35.432
BY THE CALIFORNIA ACCREDITED-

04:33:35.499 --> 04:33:37.033
ALL INSTITUTIONS IN THE AREA.

04:33:37.100 --> 04:33:38.969
SO FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL AND

04:33:39.035 --> 04:33:43.340
OTHERS TO CHALLENGE- WHETHER OR

04:33:43.406 --> 04:33:45.375
NOT MILITARY FOLKS SHOULD BE

04:33:45.442 --> 04:33:46.777
SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE OUR GI

04:33:46.843 --> 04:33:47.978
BENEFITS TO BE ABLE TO GO TO

04:33:48.044 --> 04:33:50.247
SCHOOL IN THESE CALIFORNIA

04:33:50.313 --> 04:33:55.519
CREDITS- SCHOOLS. I THINK IS

04:33:55.585 --> 04:33:59.756
PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE LET'S TAKE-

04:33:59.823 --> 04:34:00.390
SOME OF THE METRICS THAT WERE

04:34:00.457 --> 04:34:03.193
IDENTIFIED EARLIER 75% BAR

04:34:03.260 --> 04:34:06.163
PASSAGE RATE WAS REPRESENTED AS

04:34:06.229 --> 04:34:08.298
THE MINIMUM WELL WITH THIS

04:34:08.365 --> 04:34:10.700
AUTHOR ON OR THIS OPPONENT

04:34:10.767 --> 04:34:12.669
FAILED TO MENTION THAT'S ON A

04:34:12.736 --> 04:34:14.738
TWO YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE. AND

04:34:14.805 --> 04:34:16.640
EVEN SOME ABA ACCREDITED

04:34:16.706 --> 04:34:20.143
SCHOOLS DON'T HIT THAT NUMBER.

04:34:20.210 --> 04:34:23.213
AND SO I THINK THIS INDIVIDUAL

04:34:23.280 --> 04:34:25.515
IS CATEGORIZING ALL CALIFORNIA

04:34:25.582 --> 04:34:28.151
ACCREDITED SCHOOLS IN THE LAW

04:34:28.218 --> 04:34:30.921
WHO IS A- LAW DEGREE DOT COM

04:34:30.987 --> 04:34:32.889
SITUATION I THINK THAT'S WHAT

04:34:32.956 --> 04:34:35.158
HE WAS SAYING. BUT THERE ARE A

04:34:35.225 --> 04:34:36.693
NUMBER OF FINE INSTITUTIONS

04:34:36.760 --> 04:34:38.895
THAT PROVIDE A SERVICE TO FOLKS

04:34:38.962 --> 04:34:42.199
WHO ARE ELIGIBLE- HAVING GONE

04:34:42.265 --> 04:34:44.167
INTO THE MILITARY OR RETIRED

04:34:44.234 --> 04:34:47.437
FROM IT. AND IF ANYBODY CARES

04:34:47.504 --> 04:34:49.472
ABOUT PROVIDING LEGAL EDUCATION

04:34:49.539 --> 04:34:52.042
TO FOLKS IN- LESS POPULATED

04:34:52.108 --> 04:34:55.378
AREAS- OF RURAL AREAS. THAN

04:34:55.445 --> 04:34:56.646
THEY KNOW THE VALUE THAT THESE

04:34:56.713 --> 04:34:58.782
THESE THESE SCHOOLS PROVIDE LET

04:34:58.849 --> 04:34:59.716
THE INDIVIDUAL MAKE THE

04:34:59.783 --> 04:35:01.418
DECISION ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY

04:35:01.484 --> 04:35:02.819
WANT TO GO TO A SCHOOL THAT

04:35:02.886 --> 04:35:05.522
WILL BE RECOGNIZED. IN ANOTHER

04:35:05.589 --> 04:35:07.991
STATE BUT FOR THOSE THAT KNOW

04:35:08.058 --> 04:35:08.625
THEY WANT TO PRACTICE AND LIVE

04:35:08.692 --> 04:35:10.527
IN CALIFORNIA THAT SHOULD BE

04:35:10.594 --> 04:35:11.862
THEIR DECISION SO WE'RE

04:35:11.928 --> 04:35:13.797
HONORING THE MILITARY IN THEIR

04:35:13.864 --> 04:35:17.701
SERVICE- THROUGH THE GI BILL

04:35:17.767 --> 04:35:18.335
AND THE FUNDING THAT GOES ALONG

04:35:18.401 --> 04:35:20.737
WITH THAT. THESE INDIVIDUALS

04:35:20.804 --> 04:35:23.607

04:35:23.673 --> 04:35:24.941
