LET US ALL JOIN IN CELEBRATING THE EXCEPTIONAL AND INDISPUTABLY AMERICAN NARRATIVES OF OUR API FRIENDS FAMILIES AND NEIGHBORS BY SUPPORTING SR THITY TWO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN CENTER LAYERED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT. I SALUTE SENATOR PAN AND THE CARCASS FOR THIS LIST OF PEOPLE. AND I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE SOMEBODY THAT'S NOT ON THE LIST AND HAPPENS TO BE. A CONSTITUENT IS TOMMY GORMAN WHO IS ONE OF THE FIRST IF NOT THE FIRST OF LOCAL COUNTY CLERK. WHO IS ASIAN AMERICAN AND AS THE NATIONAL NEWS HAS REPORTED AT A PUBLIC MEETING OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS- JUST TIE THINK LAST WEEK HE WAS SUBJECTED TO AN ANTI ASIAN SLOWER IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CROWDED PUBLIC MEETING. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IN THE LIGHT OF WHAT WAS SAID IN INTRODUCING THIS RESOLUTION. THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE OUTSTANDING LEADERS AND THEY SUBJECT SPORTS SUBJECT TO SOME OF THIS DISCRIMINATION. THAT GOES ON AND IT HAPPENED THAT DAY AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US TO CALL IT OUT. NOT JUST VOTE FOR THIS RESOLUTIONBUT SUPPORT THE ONE OF THE OWNER REACHED IT IS ACTUALLY COMPILING AND DOCUMENTING AND HIGHLIGHTING. AND RESPONDING TO THE HATE THAT EXISTS SO IN THE NAME OF TOM AND GONE I'M GONNA BE PROUD TO VOTE FOR THIS RESOLUTION AND ASK ALL MY COLLEAGUES TO DO IT AS WELL THANK. YOU THANK YOU SAID EARLIER SENATOR MAN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT HIGH RISE AS A PROUD CO AUTHORED SR. THIRTY TWO AND IS A MEMBER OF THE A. K. LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS. AND I WANT TO THANK MY GOOD FRIEND FROM SACRAMENTO FOR AUTHORING THIS RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING OUR COMMUNITY. S. R. THIRTY TWO RECOGNIZES THE MONTH OF MAY S. A. P. I. HERITAGE MONTH. WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW TO RECOGNIZE THIS AND THE VALUE AND IMPORTANCE OF API HISTORY. GIVEN ALL OF THE WELL DOCUMENTED AND UBIQUITOUS HEY AND HARDSHIP THAT OUR API COMMUNITY. HASN'T HEARD OVER THE PAST YEAR. NOW WE KNOW THAT ANTI ASIAN DISCRIMINATION IS NOT NEW AND GOES BACK TO THE ORIGINS OF IMMIGRATION TO THIS COUNTRY. BUT WHAT WE'RE FACING RIGHT NOW IS SHOCKING AND FRIGHTENING TO MANY OF US- AND I THINK JUST THE FACT THAT PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY CAN GO UP TO ASIAN AMERICANS IN THE STREET. IN THEIR PLACES OF WORK AT THEIR HOMES. AND EVEN IF NOT NECESSARILY COMMIT VIOLENT ACTS WHICH WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF- JUST INVADE PEOPLE'S SENSE OF SAFETY AND SECURITY- I THINK ALLOWS IT BECAUSE IT'S TOO MANY OF US TO FEEL FRIGHTENED TO FEEL UNWELCOME IN THIS COUNTRY. AND WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN. WE ALL KNOW THE CALIFORNIA AND UNITED STATES ARE BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE OF OUR DIVERSITY AND THAT IS IN PART BECAUSE OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF ASIANS. AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS LIKE MY PARENTS WHO CAME. OUT TO HEAR FROM KOREA IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE. MY PARENTS GREW UP IN THE KOREAN WAR AND ITS AFTERMATH AT A TIME WHEN FOOD WAS SCARCE. AND THE ECONOMY WAS STRUGGLING AND THE REASON THEY LOVE SPAM AND TRIED TO RAISE ME AND MY BROTHER LOVE SPAM SOMETHING THAT DID NOT STICK. WAS BECAUSE OF THE GENEROSITY OF THE EYES AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHY SPAM IS SO POPULAR IN KOREA AND MANY ASIAN COUNTRIES. IT'S BECAUSE OF THAT. AND I THINK WE ARE THE EPITOME OF THE AMERICAN DREAM A STORY TAT'S BEEN SHARED BY MILLIONS OF OTHER ATI IMMIGRANTS OVER THE PAST YEARS AND GENERATIONS. WE'VE MADE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS COUNTRY. AS WE ALL KNOW AND THIS HAS BEEN A WELCOME HOME FOR CALIFORNIANS OF API DISSENT OVER THE PAST FEC. VACATES WITH SIXTY ONE THREE MILLION EIGHT. LIVE HERE. A NUMBER THAT WILL GROW OVER TIME. WE HAVE. TO CONDEMN THIS VIOLENCE AND WELCOME ASIAN AMERICANS AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM ON- THE CENTER WHERE DISSIPATED. IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO CONDEMN HATE TO CONDEMN AND STAND UP AGAINST THISTYPE OF BUILDING THAT WE'RE SEEING. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE PLACES THE API'S CALL HOME. WHERE WE FEEL COMFORTABLE IF WE DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE HERE WHERE CAN WE FEEL COMFORTABLE IN UNITED STATES. SO I APPRECIATE THIS RESOLUTION. THE RECOGNITION OF OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES WITH CELEBRATIONS LIKE ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER HERITAGE MONTH. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU SENATOR MEN CENTER BRADFORD.

JURY ALSO MET HER GOAL OF IT EVENTUALLY JOINING FORCES WITH MALCOLM ACTS TO WORK TOWARD RACIAL JUSTICE AND HUMANRIGHTS. AS WE CELEBRATE THIS MONTH IN THE CONSONANTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE API COMMUNITY. WE SHOULD ALSO CONTINUE TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE HARMFUL DISCRIMINATION AND- PHYSICAL THREATS OR VIOLENCE INFLICTED UPON THEM. HATE VIOLENCE IS A PUBLIC SAFETY AND PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE ALL CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE CONCERNED WITH NOT JUST THOSE THAT FIND THEMSELVES THE VICTIMS OF IT. AS CALIFORNIANS MARCH ST DIVERSITY IS OUR BEACON OF PRIDE AND WE MUST BE WILLING TO DO EVERYTHING WITHIN OUR POWER TO STAND WITH THOSE THREATENED BY THIS AND PROMOTE RACIAL HARMONY AND LET US REMAIN MINDFUL AND CELEBRATE AND UPLIFT A.

WE ARE AFTER ALL THE BENEFICIARY STATE OF THIRTY ALMOST 32% OF OUR NATION'S ASIAN OWNED BUSINESSES WE MUST CHANGE THE HATE NARRATIVE THAT IS GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY. I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH THE STORY OF RALPH LASSELL AN EXAMPLE OF THE SOLIDARITY BETWEEN THE API AND LATINO COMMUNITIES HE WAS A TEENAGER. I WATCHED IN HORROR AS ALL OF HIS JAPANESE AMERICAN FRIENDS WERE SENT TO INTERNMENT CAMPS DURING WORLD WAR TWO. SO HE BECAME THE ONLY KNOWN PERSON OF NON JAPANESE ANCESTRY. WHO VOLUNTEERED TO LIVE IN AN INTERNMENT CAMP. WHAT SOME SAW AS A YEARS LONG RUSSE OR PROOF THAT HE SYMPATHIZED WITH THE ENEMY HE SAW AS AN ACT OF SOLIDARITY HE HAD EXPERIENCED RACISM RACISM IN HIS OWN SHORT LIFE. FREE TOOK THIS PERSONAL DECISION AND STAYED IN THE INTERNMENT CAMP FOR TWO YEARS WITH HIS FRIENDS A PRISONER BY CHOICE ACTING FROM HIS CONSCIOUS.

SENATE BILL SIXTY TWO BY SENATOR DORADO AND AFTER LEADING TO EMPLOYMENT CENTER DRAWS SO THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT S. B. SIXTY TWO MAKES CLEAR THAT A BUSINESS CONTRACTING TO HAVE GARMENTS MADE IS LIABLE FOR UNPAID WAGES TO THE SKILLED WORKERS WHO MAKE THOSE GARMENTS REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY LAYERS OF CONTRACTING THAT COMPANY MAY USE. SINCE THE ORIGINAL GARMENT WORKER PROTECTION ACT WAS PASSED WE HAVE IDENTIFIED TWO UNDERLYING CAUSES OF WAGE THEFT. THAT HAVE CAUSE CALIFORNIA TO FALL BEHIND IN THE WORLD. LEAVING TAXPAYERS TO SUBSIDIZE PERVASIVE EXPLOITATION FIRST FASHION BRANDS CREATE POVERTY WAGES TO THE UNREALISTIC PRICING OF GARMENT ORDERS AND YET THEY HAVE NO LEGAL LIABILITY. AND THE ARCHAIC SYSTEM OF PAIN BY PIECE RATE. KEEPS MINIMUM WAGE ALWAYS OUT OF THE REACH FOR THESE WORKERS ONE HUNDRED FORTY FASHION INDUSTRY BUSINESSES MOSTLY WOMEN LED SMALL BUSINESSES. ARE LEADING THE CHARGE FOR ETHICAL WORKPLACE AND SUSTAINABILITY STANDARDS IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY. DISRUPTIONS TO THE GLOBAL CHAIN FROM THIS PANDEMIC CAT MOTIVATED COMPANIES TO SET UP SHOP IN LOS ANGELES FOR BENEFIT OF THE SKILLED LABOR. BRANSON REALIZE THE ADVANTAGE OF A STRONG DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY IN REDUCING RISKS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH INVENTORY AS THE LARGEST INDUSTRY OF ITS KIND IN THE U. S. THE APPAREL MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY PRODUCES FOUR POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL ANNUAL OUTPUT FIST IN LOS ANGELES ALONE. WE'VE HEARD FROM THESE WOMEN ESSENTIAL WORKERS MANY OF WHOM MAY THE COUNTRY'S MASK FOR TWO CENTS A PIECE. FIFTY SIXTY TWO IS THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS PRIORITY BILL. COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU SENATOR RUSSELL MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE SENATOR ATKINS. PRESIDENT THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT HI RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB SIXTY TWO. THIS I REALLY A PERSONAL ISSUE FOR ME AS MANY OF YOU KNOW YOU'VE HEARD ME TELL ABOUT MY MOTHER WHO WAS A SEAMSTRESS AND SHE WAS A REALL GOOD ONE I MIGHT ADD. I WILL NEVER FORGET WATCHING MY MOM NIGHT AFTER NIGHT DOING HER FIGURES. WHICH IS WHAT SHE CALLED IT WHEN SHE WOULD TALLY UP HER NUMBERS TO DETERMINE IF SHE HAD MADE PRODUCTION I KNEW THOSE TECHNICAL TERMS AT A VERY YOUNG AGE. LIKE MANY GARMENT WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA MOST OF WHOM ARE WOMEN SHE WORKED PIECEMEAL. SO IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH MONEY YOUR FAMILY WOULD HAVE AT THE END OF THE WEEK FOR FOOD OR RENT EXPENSES. SHE WOULD HAVE TO GRAB A PENCIL AND PAPER AND DO HER FIGURES. I ACTUALLY JOINED MY MOM AT THE FACTORY ONE SUMMER WHILE I WAS HOME FROM COLLEGE IT WAS ONE OF THE HARDEST JOBS I'VE EVER HAD. BUT I KNEW I'D BE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL COME FALL. MY MOM DID NOT HAVE THAT SAME RELIEF. DAY AFTER DAY YEAR AFTER YEAR SHE WOULD GO TO THE FACTORY. TO A VERY DEMANDING JOB OR SHE MADE VERY LITTLE MONEY. AS SHE GOT OLDER AND SLOW DOWN THE FIGURES YET ADD UP AT THE KITCHEN TABLE GOT SMALLER AND SMALLER. THAT WAS IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES.

MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL ONE SIXTH SENATE BILL SIX FIFTY FOUR BY SENATOR MEN AND ACTUALLY DID A CHILD CUSTODY SENATOR. MY APOLOGIES MADAM PRESIDENT FOR THE DELAY THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SP SIX FIFTY FOUR WHICH CREATES NE PROTECTIONS AND EXTENDS EXISTING SAFEGUARDS FOR CHILDREN IN FAMILY COURT. SPECIFICALLY THIS BUILD US TWO THINGS FIRST SB SIX FIFTY FOUR PREVENTS A CHILD'S TESTIMONY FROM BEING GIVEN IN THE PRESS PRESENCE OF PARTY SEEKING CUSTODY SUCH AS THE CHILD'S PARENTS. UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY CHILDREN HAVE A RIGHT TO BE HEARD IN CUSTODY AND THEY SHOULD BE HEARD ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE SAFE AND ACCOMMODATING SECONDLY SP SIX FIFTY FOUR TAKES EXISTING SAFETY MEASURES USED RELATED TO CHILD CUSTODY DETERMINATION. AND EXTENDS THEM TO UNSUPERVISED VISITATION SPECIFICALLY INSURERS IT ENSURES THAT JUDGES CONSIDER HISTORIES OF ABUSE AND ADDICTION WHEN MAKING CUSTODY DETERMINATIONS. THIS IS A CRITICAL MEASURE THAT WILL ENSURE THE SAFETY AND THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING CHILDREN OUR TOP PRIORITIES IN CONTENTIOUS CUSTODY BATTLES. THANK YOU MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU CENTERMAN MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE SENATOR RUBIO. AND PRESIDENT THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE TODAY I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AND A PROUD CO AUTHOR TO THIS BILL THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT BILL IN MY VIEW AS IT PERTAINS TO OUR CHILDREN WHICH ARE MOST VALUED AND VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. THIS FEELS IMPORTANT FOR TWO REASONS NUMBER ONE. WE HAVE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMETIMES CHILDREN GO BACK TO AN ABUSIVE HOUSEHOLD AND HOW SOME CHILDREN DON'T MAKE IT OUT. I WANT TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF PEAKY A FIVE YEAR OLD BOY IN MY DISTRICT WHO WAS MURDERED SUFFOCATED BY HIS FATHER AFTER COURT. RELEASED HIM TO HIS FATHER KNOWING THERE HAD BEEN ABUSE IN THE HOME. NUMBER TWO. I ALSO KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO SPEAK UP. AGAINST SOMEONE THAT HAS HARM TO YOU. IT'S ALREADY STRESSFUL ENOUGH FOR AN ADULT AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT THAT MEANS FOR A CHILD HAVING TO TESTIFY. OR SPEAK AGAINST ONE OR BOTH PARENTS. AND STILL TAKING THAT TESTIMONY AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE THAT HARM HIM IS VITAL FOR A CHILD TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK. WITH THE- CLARITY AND FEEL SAFE ABOUT IT. IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT SO I APPRECIATE THAT SENATOR FROM IRVINE FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE UP. WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT IF WE EVER ALLOW A CHILD TO GO BACK INTO AN ABUSIVE HOME. THAT WE HAVE A GOOD REASON FOR DOING SO IT HAS TO BE IN WRITING AND THEY HAVE TO JUSTIFY THAT THE RETURN OF THE CHILD. I ALSO WANT TO SPEAK FOR SAP A LITTLE BOY THAT DIDN'T REALLY GET. VERY MUCH COVERAGE AND I MY PERSONAL OPINION DESERVES. TO BE HIGHLIGHTED GABRIEL. FERNANDES WHO ALSO WAS HARMED BY HIS BIOLOGICAL MOTHER THE STEPFATHER AND EVEN THOUGH THIS DOES NOT FALL UNDER THIS LAW THIS CHILD BY EIGHTEEN WAS SEEN BY HIS TEACHERS ADMINISTRATORS CHILD WELFARE WELFARE SERVICES THEY ALL SAW THE BRUISES AND EVERYTHING THIS LITTLE BOY WAS HAVING TWIN DOOR AND WE FAILED TO PROTECT HIM SO I THINK THIS BILL IS WHAT WE NEED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OUR CHILDREN MUST COME FIRST AND WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IDOL THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO SENT REPORTERS. THE NUMBER THAT I'D LIKE TO COMMEND THE SENATOR FROM IRVINE FOR BRING THIS FORWARD. NORMALLY AT ONE OF THE BEDROCK BEDROCK PRINCIPLES THEIR LEGAL SYSTEM IS THE- CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHT TO CONFRONT AN ACCUSER. THAT'S NOT THE SITUATION WE FIND OURSELVES IN WITH CHILDREN. AND I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND- WHAT IT'S LIKE WHEN CHILDREN ARE PITTED AGAINST PARENTS IN A CUSTODY BATTLE OR THEY'RE HAVING TO CONFRONT NDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES THOSE THAT- CAN INTIMIDATE AND LEAVE LONG LASTING IMPRESSIONS- ON THOSE WHO WERE WITHIN SUBJECTED TO CROSS EXAMINATION. IN A CUSTODY BATTLE. SO THIS IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN OUR TRADITIONAL NOTION OF. OUR BEING ABLE TO CROSS EXAMINE SOMEBODY ELSE AND THESE ARE VERY UNIQUE AND VULNERABLE- CIRCUMSTANCES THAT CHILDREN FIND THEMSELVES IN. AND I AM PROUD TO CO AUTHOR- THIS BILL WITH THE CENTER FROM IRVINE AND- THANK YOU FOR MOVING US FORWARD AND CERTAINLY- ENCOURAGE ALL OF US TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR BORDERS MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE.

SENATE BILL SIX BY SENATOR KERR BIO AN ACT RELATING TO LAND USE SYNDERGAARD BIO THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE TODAY 2% S. B. EIGHT THE NEIGHBORHOOD HOMES ACT. IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA'S FAMILIES THE STATE MUST INCREASE HOUSING PRODUCTION GET THE LACK OF AVAILABLE LAND FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES TO BE A BARRIER TO BUILD. THIS ADAPTIVE REUSE BUILT WILL SPUR HOUSING PRODUCTION CENTER RIGHT OVER YOUR- MANTA REVIEW FOR A SECOND YOU SAID SENATE SENATE BILL EIGHT IS WE THINK IT'S S. B. SIX. YES VERY GOOD WE JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR SORRY INTERRUPT PLEASE PROCEED NO PROBLEM. THIS ADDS ADAPTIVE REUSE BILL WILL SPUR HOUSING PRODUCTION BY AUTHORIZING RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT ON EXISTING LOTS CURRENTLY ZONED FOR COMMERCIAL OFFICE AND RETAIL USE SUCH AS STRIP MALLS OR LARGE MALLS AND BIG BOX RETAIL SPACES. MOST SIMPLY SB SIX WILL SPUR HOUSING PRODUCTION BY ALLOWING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO APPROVE RESIDENTIAL OR MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT ON COMMERCIALLY ZONED RETAIL OR OFFICE SPACE BY UTILIZING AN EXPEDITED PROCESS. REQUIRING HOUSING DEVELOPMENT MEET OR EXCEED THE DENSITY DEEMED APPROPRIATE TO ACCOMMODATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUCH AS APARTMENTS TOWN HOMES AND CONDOMINIUMS AND PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY FOR LOCAL DECISION MAKING BY SUBJECTING DEVELOPMENT TO LOCAL PLANNING PARKING AND DESIGN ORDINANCES. WE HAVE SEEN A SHIFT IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES OVER TIME WHICH HAS LEFT MANY COMMUNITIES WITH STRIP MALLS AND MALLS WITH MAJOR TENANT BIGOTS VACANCIES WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO THE DECLINE OF THE RETAIL CENTER INCREASING-BLIGHT. VANDALISM AND DECLINING SALES TAX REVENUES IN MY RURAL DISTRICT THESE RETAILERS ARE OUR MAJOR TENANTS AND I EXPECT TO SEE MANY MORE RETAILERS LEAVE AS THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE. THESE UNDER UTILIZED IN BAKING VACANT COMMERCIAL SPACES ARE ALONG MAJOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION ROUTES AND CONTAIN SIGNIFICANT ACREAGE AVAILABLE TO DEVELOP FOR MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT TO CREATE WALKABLE LIVE WORK PLAY VILLAGES. THIS CONCEPT WILL ALSO HELP REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY CREATING THE OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF VEHICLE TRIPS ARE ERRANDS BY LOOK LOCATING SERVICES WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE. WITH NO COST TO THE STATE SB SIX WILL INCENTIVIZE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT IMPACTING SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS BY GIVING LANDOWNERS AND DEVELOPERS A WAY TO MEET THE GROWING DEMAND FOR HOUSING.

TWENTY EIGHT THE RURAL BROADBAND IN DIFFA REFORM ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. S. B. TWENTY EIGHT DOES TWO THINGS FIRST IT PUT STATE ASSETS TO WORK IN THE DEPLOYMENT OF BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE S. B. TWENTY EIGHT REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY CALTRANS THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND OTHER RELEVANT STATE AGENCIES TO INVENTORY STATE RESOURCES. THAT CAN BE PUT MADE AVAILABLE FOR BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE AT MINIMUM SPEEDS OF A HUNDRED MEGABITS PER SECOND DOWNLOAD SPEEDS. S. B. TWENTY EIGHT TAKES A BROAD VIEW OF STATE RESOURCES INCLUDING REAL PROPERTY THAT COULD BE USED TO CITE BROADBAND EQUIPMENT RIGHTS OF WAYS IT COULD BE USED FOR ROUTING FIBER AND EVEN WIRELESS SPECTRUM THAT COULD BE USED FOR BANDWIDTH CAPACITY. S. B. TWENTY EIGHT CREATES TEMPLATE LICENSING AGREEMENT SO THAT THE STATE CAN READILY CONTRIBUTE THESE RESOURCES TO BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. SECONDLY AS B. TWENTY EIGHT AMENDS FOR THE FIRST TIME THE STATUTE CALLED THE DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE VIDEO COMPETITION ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SIX OR DEFER. DEFER PROVIDES CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES WITH THE STATE WIDE TEN YEAR LONG FRANCHISE LICENSE TO DEPLOY DIGITAL VIDEO SERVICES. SINCE THEY'VE GOT PAST THE DIGITAL VIDEO PAY TV BUSINESS ACCOMPLISH COMPLETE MARK MARKET SATURATION MEANING PAY TV SERVICES ARE AS UBIQUITOUS AS ENERGY AND WATER UTILITIES NEARLY A COMMODITY IN THEIR SCALE. DIFFICULT FRANCHISEES HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO LOW INCOME BUILD OUT REQUIREMENTS SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE I'M GONNA SAY THAT AGAIN THEY HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO LOW INCOME BUILD OUT REQUIREMENTS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE AND THE C. P. U. C. DOES NOT RECEIVE SUFFICIENT SELF REPORTED DATA. FROM THE LICENSEES TO KNOW IF THOSE RESIDENTS ARE RECEIVING SERVICES IN A NON DISCRIMINATORY MANNER NOW I KNOW THAT YOU HVE BEEN MADE AWARE. ABOUT THE LACK OF SERVICES AND THE LACK OF HIGH SPEED IN MANY OF OUR POOREST COMMUNITIES AND IT'S NO SURPRISE BECAUSE. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE. THE INTERNET WAS FIRST THE PLANNED AND ROLLED OUT WHY BECAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF THOSE RESIDENTS AND SO AS A CONSEQUENCE THE COMPANIES HAVE CHERRY PICKED AND IT MADE- THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THE TO THE COMMUNITIES IT CAN AFFORD TO PAY FOR IT AND IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT THIS DID THIS PANDEMIC TAUGHT US IT'S THAT THIS IN EQUITABLE SYSTEM. OF INTERNET. AVAILABILITY HAS REALLY HURT OUR FAMILIES HAVE IT HAS HURT OUR BUSINESSES AND HAS HURT- CHILDREN IN PARTICULAR. GAINING S. B. TWENTY EIGHT REFORMS DITKA IT REQUIRES GRANULAR DATA BE REPORTED TO THE C. P. U. C. SO THAT FINALLY THE STATE WILL HAVE AN ACCURATE ACCOUNTING OF THE GAPS GAINING THIS ACCURATE NETWORK MAP IS CRITICAL FOR CALIFORNIA WITHOUT THIS DATA THE CPUC CANNOT READILY DETERMINE IF A LICENSE SHOULD BE RENEWED FOR AN ADDITIONAL TERM OF TEN YEARS AND RENEWING A STATEWIDE LICENSE FOR THAT LENGTHY PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT THIS DATA IS NOT IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST PRIOR TO DAVE KA FRANCHISE HOLDERS HAD TO NEGOTIATE WITH EACH LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE GAME SUBSCRIBER ACCESS IN A SERVICE TERRITORY. AND DIFFICULT REMOVED LOCAL CITIES AND COUNTIES FROM THE NEGOTIATING TABLE AND I REMEMBER BECAUSE AS A MAYOR WE'VE NEGOTIATED THESE DEALS FOR MANY MANY YEARS UNTIL THE STATE CREATED A STATEWIDE FRANCHISE AND TOOK US AWAY FROM THE TABLE S. B. TWENTY IT REQUIRES THE CPUC TO CONSULT WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH IN THE FRANCHISE FRANCHISEES SERVICE TERRITORY RESTORING SOME LOCAL NEGOTIATING POWERS TO CITIES AND COUNTIES WITHOUT IMMEDIATELY SHIFTING THE COST AND COMPLEXITY OF NEGOTIATING THE FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS BACK TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS.

AND WHAT IT DOES IS IT RIGHT NOW THE DENSITY BONUS LAW HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO BE APPLIED TO HOUSING THAT IS BUILT FOR STUDENTS SO IT ALLOWS THE GIVES A DEFINITION OF WHAT STUDENT HOUSING WOULD BE ALLOWABLE. AND GIVE US AN INCENTIVE A DENSITY BONUS NCENTIVE IF 20% OF THE UNITS ENOUGH STUDENT HOUSING PROJECT OUR DEDICATED FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS. IT ALSO% CONFORMS OR DENSITY BONUS LAW WITH ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS IN OUR OTHER EXISTING IN SOME OF OUR OTHER EXISTING HOUSING LAWS.

THANK YOU- MADAM PRESIDENT AND SENATORS SP FOUR FIVE SEVEN WILL FURTHER CALIFORNIA'S DIVEST IN FROM TURKEY A COUNTRY WITH REPEATED HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. IN MY DISTRICT MANY PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IN THE CITY OF GLENDALE ARE MEMBERS OF CAL STIRS IN CALPERS AND THEIR DESCENDANTS OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE SURVIVORS MOST OF THEM HAD TO RELIEVE. THE INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA DURING THE RECENT ARTSAKH WAR IN TURKEY WHICH TURKEY WAS HEAVILY INVOLVED THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT FUNDS WILL NOT BE INVESTED IN THE SAME COUNTRY THAT THE CONTINUES TO BE A THREAT. TO THEIR FAMILIES IN ARMENIA INVESTMENT FROM TURKISH BONDS OVER THE GOVERNMENT'S DENIAL OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE WOULD IMPOSE MUCH NEEDED ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES ON A REGIME THAT CONTINUES TO ENGAGE IN POLICIES THAT CONSTITUTE CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY. TURKEY SHOWED ACTIVE MILITARY SUPPORT TO AZERBAIJAN IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ARTSAKH WAR. DEEPENING INSTABILITY OF THE REGION JUST THIS YEAR TURKEY WITHDREW FROM THE COUNCIL OF EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON PREVENTING AND COMBATING VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BETTER KNOWN AS THE ISTANBUL CONVENTION AND IT CONTINUES TO SUPPORT AZERBAIJAN'S REFUSAL. TO RETURN PRISONERS OF WAR TO ARMENIA ON TOP OF THE HUMANITARIAN ISSUES THIS IS ALL SCHOOLS ALSO A FISCAL ISSUE FOR OUR RETIREMENT FUNDS SOCIAL INJUSTICE POLITICAL INSTABILITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS CREATE AN UNSTABLE MARKET THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE INVESTING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR CITY AND SCHOOL EMPLOYEES. WE KNOW THAT IT'S IN THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO DIVEST FROM TURKEY IN FACT UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SYSTEM SUCCESSFULLY DIVESTITURE IN TURKEY IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. I ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT ARMENIAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS THE CALIFORNIA MEDIA BROTHERS AND SISTERS ACROSS OUR STATE HOW THEIR HARD EARNED RETIREMENT FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEING INVESTED IN A COUNTRY THAT SLAUGHTER THEIR RELATIVES DESTROY THEIR HISTORY. AND CONTINUES TO DENY ITS ROLE IN THESE ATROCITIES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN I. PHONE. THANK YOU SENATOR PORTENT TINO MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE SENATOR BORCHERS. PRESIDENT I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THE ARMENIAN SENATE CAUCUS CHAIR'S COMMENTS. NORMALLY I HAD RESERVATIONS ABOUT USING SOMETHING ARE AT OUR DISPOSAL LIKE A RETIREMENT SYSTEM. TO AFFECT INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS. BUT THIS IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SITUATION IT'S HISTORIC IT'S PERSONAL. AND AS WE'VE SEEN WITH THE- ONGOING HOSTILITIES. IN THE CAUCUSES SPECIFICALLY IN ARTSAKH TURKEY HAS NO INTEREST WHATSOEVER IN CHANGING ITS SPOTS. IT HAS SHOWN ITS NATURE IN A YOU'D BE FOOLISH FOOLISH OF US NOT TO RECOGNIZE WHAT HE BEHAVIOR IT IS SHOWN IN LEARN FROM THAT. SO IF THERE'S A WAY FOR CALIFORNIA TO TAKE A MORE ASSERTIVE IN TARGETED IN SURGICAL ROLE. IN SENDING A MESSAGE TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY AND THE ERDOGAN ADMINISTRATION.

SP SIX SIX ZERO ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE BY PROHIBITING THE PRACTICE OF PAYING SIGNATURE GATHERERS ON A PER SIGNATURE BASIS WHEN COLLECTING SIGNATURES TO PLACE A STATE OR LOCAL INITIATIVE REFERENDUM A RECALL ON THE BALLOT. THIS MEASURE WILL NOT PROHIBIT PAYMENT FOR SIGNATURE GATHERING THAT IS NOT BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SIGNATURES OBTAINED CHANGER GATHERS CAN STILL BE PAID ON AN HOURLY OR SALARIED BASIS THIS GOOD GOVERNMENT MEASURE WILL SERVE TO STRENGTHEN A RECALL REFERENDUM AND INITIAL PROCESSES.

BE SIX SEVENTY EIGHT WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT BILL HERE IN CALIFORNIA IT WILL BE THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION TO FOCUS ON UNIQUE NEEDS OF UNACCOMPANIED WOMEN EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. DESPITE MAKING UP NEARLY ONE THIRD OF HOMELESS ADULTS NATIONWIDE THERE ARE NO PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON THE NEEDS AND THEIR EXPERIENCES IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALSO NOTE THAT 80% OF THIS GROUP REPORTED TRAUMA OR ABUSE. AT THE FOR THE COST OF THEIR HOMELESSNESS SO WHEN PEOPLE USUALLY ASK VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE YOU KNOW WHY DIDN'T SHE LEAVE. THIS IS. PART OF THE ANSWER.

CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALSO ACUTELY AFFECTING CALIFORNIA'S COASTED MORE SUBTLE IN DAMAGING WAYS THROUGH SEA LEVEL RISE. WARNING TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ARE LMAO CALIFORNIA COULD EXPERIENCE C. LEVEL RISE OF HALF A FOOT IN THE NEXT DECADE IN UP TO SEVEN FEET BY THE END OF THE CENTURY. IRIARTE CONVINCED LIKE COASTAL STORMS AND KING TIDES WERE ABLE FI THESE EFFECTS. STATE GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ONLY IN THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF PLANNING FOR AND ANTICIPATING SEA LEVEL RISE. THE LONGER WE WAIT THE MORE COSTLY THE DAMAGE WILL BE. IN FACT THE ELLIE- RECOMMENDS MORE FUNDING GREATER STATE REGIONAL AND LOCAL COLLABORATION. AND BETTER INFORM PLANNING AND LAND USE DECISIONS TO ADDRESS SEA LEVEL RISE. AND THAT IS THE HEART OF THIS BILL. SB ONE ESTABLISHES A STRUCTURE TO IMPLEMENT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. SPECIFICALLY THE BILL REQUIRES NEW PLANNING IMPLEMENTATION OF PUBLIC AGENCY COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS TO ADDRESS THE IMPACTS OF SEA LEVEL RISE. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN CALIFORNIA LAW. S. B. ONE ALSO ESTABLISHES A NEW CROSS GOVERNMENT COLLABORATIVE TO INSURE THE IMPACTS OF SEA LEVEL RISE ARE ANTICIPATED. AND ADDRESSED BEYOND SIMPLY ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS. BUT ALSO BY OUR TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE AGENCIES. FINALLY IT PROVIDES NEW FUNDING CONTINGENT UPON APPROPRIATION IN THE ANNUAL BUDGET FOR STATE REGIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PLAN FOR AND MITIGATE FOR SEA LEVEL RISE. IN ADDRESSING SEA LEVEL RISE WE CANNOT FORGET ABOUT ADDRESSING OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S WHY THIS BILL EXPANDS THE EXISTING CAL EPA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GRANT PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED FROM SEA LEVEL RISE. HAVE A VOICE IN ACTIONS GOVERNMENT TAKES TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGE. SEA LEVEL RISE IS A PROBLEM I'VE SEEN IT TAKE ROOT IN MY COMMUNITIES AND THOSE OF MANY SENATORS ACROSS THE STATE I NEED ONLY MENTIONIMPERIAL BEACH WHICH IS HAD TO PLAN- HOW TO DEAL WITH THE FLOODING EVERY SINGLE YEAR.
