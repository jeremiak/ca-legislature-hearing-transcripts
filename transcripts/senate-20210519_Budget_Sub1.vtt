PERSON ATTENDS COLLEGE. IT IS

00:11:23.549 --> 00:11:25.084
ALSO THE MENTALITY OF A STUDENT

00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:27.453
WHO MAYBE THE PARENTS DON'T

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.221

REVISIONS FOCUSED ON

00:11:44.837 --> 00:11:47.273
INVESTMENTS THAT MAY BE A ONE

00:11:47.339 --> 00:11:49.275
TIME FUNDING. BUT COULD

POTENTIALLY PROVIDE LONG TERM-

00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:53.379
BENEFITS SUCH AS A STUDENT

00:11:53.446 --> 00:12:00.886

IT'S A BIG I WAS NORTH EARNED

00:12:06.859 --> 00:12:08.961
QUESTION A CENTERS GOING TO BE

00:12:09.028 --> 00:12:10.696
BALLOTS ONE KIND OF BIG

00:12:10.763 --> 00:12:12.231
QUESTION ABOUT HOW TO PROVIDE

00:12:12.298 --> 00:12:13.532
INDEED THIS ONE OF MANY WAYS TO

00:12:13.599 --> 00:12:15.434
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR

00:12:15.501 --> 00:12:17.136
STUDENTS- WHO ARE PURSUING

00:12:17.203 --> 00:12:19.271
HIGHER EDUCATION ITSELF- ON

00:12:19.338 --> 00:12:20.739
ANOTHER APPROACH WOULD BE AS

00:12:20.806 --> 00:12:21.674
YOU MENTIONED PROVIDING NO

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.075
BUILDING UP YOUR EXISTING

00:12:23.142 --> 00:12:23.943
FINANCIAL PROGRAMS LET LOW

00:12:24.009 --> 00:12:25.744
INCOME STUDENTS WHEN THEY ARE

00:12:25.811 --> 00:12:27.346
READY TO ENTER HIGHER EDUCATION

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:29.281
SYSTEM. AND HOW MANY MORE OF

00:12:29.348 --> 00:12:33.719
THOSE. COSTS ARE COVERED BY THE

00:12:33.786 --> 00:12:37.323
STATE. I CALLED. THAT- HOME.

00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:38.524
THESE DO NOT HAVE TO BE MUTE

00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:42.795
EXCLUSIVE BAND OF THIS IS A

00:12:42.862 --> 00:12:45.131
VERY VALID AND GOOD CONCEPT AND

00:12:45.197 --> 00:12:47.466
I KNOW AND ONE OF MY COUNTIES

00:12:47.533 --> 00:12:50.069
IN THE DISTRICT- THERE'S AN

00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:52.705
ATTEMPT TO DO OUR CHILD SAVINGS

00:12:52.771 --> 00:12:54.874
ACCOUNT AT A MUCH MORE SMALLER

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.243
LEVEL TO TRY TO. TO ACCOMPLISH

00:12:57.309 --> 00:12:58.777
THE SAME OBJECTIVE OBJECTIVE

00:12:58.844 --> 00:13:00.012
AND I THINK WE'RE REALLY

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:01.680
COMMITTED TO REFORMING THE

00:13:01.747 --> 00:13:03.349
STUDENT AID AND SO I REALLY

00:13:03.415 --> 00:13:05.351
HOPE THAT WE CAN MAKE ALL THESE

00:13:05.417 --> 00:13:07.153
THINGS WORK TOGETHER AND NOT

00:13:07.219 --> 00:13:09.588
CHOICE SO ARE THERE WILL BE

00:13:09.655 --> 00:13:11.891
CONVERSATIONS TO COME- MISTER

00:13:11.957 --> 00:13:13.092

YOUR COMMENTS. I GUESS I YOU

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.637
PERCENT A QUESTION- I WAS

00:13:24.703 --> 00:13:26.605
UNCLEAR FROM READING THE

00:13:26.672 --> 00:13:28.707
DESCRIPTION OF THIS PROGRAM

00:13:28.774 --> 00:13:30.509
WHETHER THIS WOULD BE MORE

00:13:30.576 --> 00:13:33.812
ORIENTED AS A DEPOSITORY TYPE-

00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:35.748
FUND OR WHETHER IT WOULD BE.

00:13:35.814 --> 00:13:38.751
INVESTED IN EQUITIES AND OKAY

00:13:38.817 --> 00:13:41.487
INDEX FUNDS AND OTHER-

00:13:41.554 --> 00:13:43.989
SECURITIES OUT IN THE MARKET.

00:13:44.056 --> 00:13:44.823
PROBABLY FOR DEPARTMENT OF

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.559
FINANCE OR ANYONE WHO HAVE HAD

00:13:46.625 --> 00:13:47.660
A ROLE IN DESIGNING THIS MAYBE

00:13:47.726 --> 00:13:49.962
COULD JUST. ELUCIDATE FOR ME

00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:52.031
LIKE WHAT WHAT'S THE PROGRAM

00:13:52.097 --> 00:13:52.631
LOOK LIKE IS IT IS IT GOING TO

00:13:52.698 --> 00:13:54.166
BE SOMETHING THAT HAS. YOU KNOW

00:13:54.233 --> 00:13:56.035
MORE LIKE BANKRATE'S AND IT'S

00:13:56.101 --> 00:13:57.369
SAFE FOR WILL BE SOMETHING THAT

00:13:57.436 --> 00:13:59.538
MAYBE A LITTLE RISKIER BECAUSE

00:13:59.605 --> 00:14:03.142
AND A HIGHER YIELD INVESTMENTS.

00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:04.843
SORRY OUT OF RENT THE APARTMENT

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:05.945
OF FINANCE WE DO THINK THAT

00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:07.179
THAT THE AYE CHILD SAVINGS

00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:08.948
ACCOUNT- PROGRAM WELL WE WOULD

00:14:09.014 --> 00:14:10.482
DEFINITELY BE WORKING WITH OUR-

00:14:10.549 --> 00:14:11.684
COLLEAGUES WERE EXPERTS IN THE

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:12.885
FIELD OF THAT VALLEY FAIR

00:14:12.952 --> 00:14:14.587
INVESTMENT BOARD. I DO WORK OUT

00:14:14.653 --> 00:14:16.222
THE DETAILS ON EXACTLY HOW THE

00:14:16.288 --> 00:14:17.489
INVESTMENTS WAY THAT WOULD

00:14:17.556 --> 00:14:18.757
ALLOW. YEAH I MEAN I WOULD

00:14:18.824 --> 00:14:21.227
EMPHASIZE THAT YOU KNOW I PUT A

00:14:21.293 --> 00:14:22.461
THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR OPEN A

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:23.262
THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR BANK

00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:24.396
ACCOUNT FOR MY KID ABOUT FIVE

00:14:24.463 --> 00:14:26.465
YEARS AGO. AND I BELIEVE THAT

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:27.433
THE TOTAL AMOUNT IN THAT

00:14:27.499 --> 00:14:29.568
ACCOUNT AND I WAS ABOUT THREE

00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:33.239
HUNDRED THREE DOLLARS. WITH

00:14:33.305 --> 00:14:35.774
WITH. THE RIGHT. BEING THEY ARE-

00:14:35.841 --> 00:14:36.575
I DON'T THINK THAT'S A FAIR.

00:14:36.642 --> 00:14:39.144
WAY TO BUILD WELL. I OKAY.

00:14:39.211 --> 00:14:40.913
ECHOED FOR ALERTS. THIS IS. A

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.081
REALLY IMPORTANT. BUILDING

00:14:42.147 --> 00:14:44.883
WEALTH DISADVANTAGED.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.218
COMMUNITIES AND CHILDREN IN

00:14:46.285 --> 00:14:47.820
PARTICULAR IS A VEXING PUBLIC

00:14:47.886 --> 00:14:50.122
POLICY PROBLEM. AND I APPLAUD

00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:52.358
THIS APPROACH. BUT I THINK THAT

00:14:52.424 --> 00:14:54.126
WE PROBABLY WANT TO LOOK MORE

00:14:54.193 --> 00:14:56.161
TO WHAT. THE SCHOLAR SHARE THE

00:14:56.228 --> 00:14:56.762
FIVE TWENTY NINE TYPE PROGRAMS

00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:59.164
ARE DOING- BUT THAT GETS TO MY

00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:00.833
SECOND QUESTION WHICH IS. IF

00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:04.837
WE'RE GOING TO KIND OF TAKE.

00:15:04.903 --> 00:15:05.404
YOU BACK ON THE SCHOLARSHIP

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:07.172
CARE. WHY MAKE ANY. OR NOT DO

00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:09.808
YOU EXISTING. TO TRY TO-

00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:11.677
PROVIDE THIS FUNDING I KNOW

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:12.278
IT'S ALWAYS COOL TO MAKE A NEW

00:15:12.344 --> 00:15:14.913
PROGRAM. BUT A NEW PROGRAM

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:15.781
COMES WITH NEW ADMINISTRATIVE

00:15:15.848 --> 00:15:18.183
COSTS- A IN THE OF THE BUILDING

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.319
FROM THE GROUND UP AND- IT

00:15:20.386 --> 00:15:21.553
SEEMS LIKE THOSE PATHWAYS

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.855
ALREADY EXIST FOR DISTRIBUTING

00:15:22.921 --> 00:15:24.390
THESE FUNDS TO CHILDREN

00:15:24.456 --> 00:15:26.592
AFFECTIONATELY. THROUGH THE

00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:28.427
SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM SO I WOULD.

00:15:28.494 --> 00:15:29.628

KNOW TRYING TO USE SOME OF THE-

00:15:37.036 --> 00:15:39.438
KIDS ARE OR OTHERPATHWAYS

00:15:39.505 --> 00:15:40.039
RATHER THAN BUILDING SOMETHING

00:15:40.105 --> 00:15:46.178
BRAND NEW. THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:15:46.245 --> 00:15:48.213

00:22:20.405 --> 00:22:21.573
THINK THOSE ESTIMATES OF

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.774
GENERAL FUND REVENUES ENDING

00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:24.342
HERE AND HERE REASONABLE WE CAN

FOR BUILDING YOUR BUDGET. I WE

00:22:27.546 --> 00:22:28.580
ALSO THINK THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:22:28.647 --> 00:22:29.948
PROPOSALS ON THE SUPPLEMENTAL

00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:31.516
PAYMENT IS REASONABLE. THE

00:22:31.583 --> 00:22:32.884
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

00:22:32.951 --> 00:22:34.786
GUARANTEE RIGHT NOW IS ABOUT AS

00:22:34.853 --> 00:22:36.154
FAR ABOVE THE CREEK AND THAT

00:22:36.221 --> 00:22:37.889
DEMOCRATS WILL AS WE THOUGHT IT

00:22:37.956 --> 00:22:39.691
WOULD BE HELLO THE CREEK AND

00:22:39.758 --> 00:22:41.059
DEMOCRATS THE LAST YEAR AND- SO

00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:42.561
THE RECOVERY THAT PAYMENT WAS

00:22:42.627 --> 00:22:45.197
ATTENDED TO A CHEESE. HAS

00:22:45.263 --> 00:22:46.798
HAPPENED. OF THE TOTAL INCREASE

00:22:46.865 --> 00:22:47.999
IN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

FIFTEEN POINT FOUR BILLION. AS

00:22:55.173 --> 00:22:56.408
FAR AS THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF

00:22:56.475 --> 00:22:58.376
THIS BUDGET THE GOVERNOR

00:22:58.443 --> 00:22:58.977
RECOGNIZES THAT HIGHER

00:22:59.044 --> 00:23:01.780
GUARANTEE SETS ASIDE MONEY AS

00:23:01.847 --> 00:23:03.315
REQUIRED IT TO MAKE THE HIGHER

00:23:03.381 --> 00:23:04.516
PROPOSITION AND YET RESERVE

00:23:12.224 --> 00:23:14.192
ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THE STATE'S

00:23:14.259 --> 00:23:16.194
ASKED PRACTICE ARE YOU HEARD

00:23:16.261 --> 00:23:17.362

PROBABLY REMEMBER THAT THE

00:23:23.668 --> 00:23:24.803
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAD A LITTLE

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.172
BIT OVER. I'M MORE THAN

00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:27.773

FUNDING FOR AFTER SCHOOL

00:24:11.516 --> 00:24:13.852
PROGRAMS- I'M MORE FUNDING FOR

00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:15.921
STUDENT SUPPORT. A LARGE

00:24:15.987 --> 00:24:16.755
DOCUMENTATION TO THE LOCAL

00:24:16.822 --> 00:24:18.390
CONTROL FUNDING LOCAL CONTROL

00:24:18.456 --> 00:24:20.058
FUNDING FORMULA. ALL THINGS THE

00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:22.093
LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN INTERESTED

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.129
IN IN THE PAST. THIS BUDGET

00:24:24.196 --> 00:24:25.797
ALSO HAS A LARGE ONE TIME

00:24:25.864 --> 00:24:28.333
QUESTION. OF THE TOTAL

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.401
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

00:24:29.467 --> 00:24:31.670
SPENDING THAT'S ATTRIBUTABLE TO

00:24:31.736 --> 00:24:32.137
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO

00:24:32.204 --> 00:24:33.672
SPECIFICALLY I NEARLY SEVEN

00:24:33.738 --> 00:24:35.373
BILLION IS FOR ONE TIME

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.776
ACTIVITIES. AND THAT GIVES YOU

00:24:37.843 --> 00:24:39.344
A LARGE ONE TIME QUESTION AND

00:24:39.411 --> 00:24:40.679
THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF WE

00:24:40.745 --> 00:24:42.914
GUARANTEE WERE TO DROP NEXT

00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:44.883
YEAR THE YEAR AFTER HAT. A

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:45.984
CHRISTIAN GIVES YOU A WAY TO

00:24:46.051 --> 00:24:49.988
AVOID. CUTS TO ONGOING PROGRAMS

00:24:50.055 --> 00:24:52.190
OR CREATING NEW DEFERRALS- ANTI

00:24:52.257 --> 00:24:53.358
DOES NOT DROP. THE STATE CAN

00:24:53.425 --> 00:24:54.593
USE THOSE FREED UP FUNDS AT

00:24:54.659 --> 00:24:55.694
THAT TIME TO PROVIDE

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.596
AUGMENTATIONS THAT ADDRESS.

00:24:57.662 --> 00:24:59.831
ISSUES THAT EMERGED AND NEW

00:24:59.898 --> 00:25:02.267
CONCERNS AT THAT TIME. WE ALSO

00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:03.568
THINK THIS MAY ADDITION HAS

00:25:03.635 --> 00:25:05.670
SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN SOME AREAS

00:25:05.737 --> 00:25:06.238
OVER THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY

00:25:06.304 --> 00:25:08.139
BUDGET. WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT

00:25:08.206 --> 00:25:09.407
LATER ABOUT HOW WE THINK THE

00:25:09.474 --> 00:25:10.742
TRANSITION PROPOSAL FOR

00:25:10.809 --> 00:25:11.877
IMPLEMENTING UNIVERSAL

00:25:11.943 --> 00:25:13.845
TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. IS

00:25:13.912 --> 00:25:15.213
BETTER THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.148
HAD PUT FORWARD IN JANUARY WE

00:25:17.215 --> 00:25:17.916
ALSO THINK THERE ARE SOME

00:25:17.983 --> 00:25:19.517
CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS TO HIS

00:25:19.584 --> 00:25:21.653
PROPOSALS AROUND THE COMMUNITY

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.789
SCHOOLS GRANT PROGRAM. IN TERMS

00:25:24.856 --> 00:25:25.757
OF- CONCERNS THAT WOULD

00:25:25.824 --> 00:25:27.325
HIGHLIGHT- YOU'LL HEAR US I

00:25:27.392 --> 00:25:30.562
THINK FLAG TO A LARGE PROPOSALS

00:25:30.629 --> 00:25:32.364
THAT WE THINK ARE. AREN'T%

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:34.633
NECESSARY I SAW ONE OF THOSE IS

00:25:34.699 --> 00:25:36.067
GOING TO BE TWO POINT SIX

00:25:36.134 --> 00:25:37.168
BILLION FOR TARGETED

00:25:37.235 --> 00:25:38.703
INTERVENTION AND THEN THERE'S

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:40.071
ANOTHER TWO BILLION FOR HEALTH

00:25:40.138 --> 00:25:42.107
AND SAFETY ACTIVITIES. WHAT IS

00:25:42.173 --> 00:25:45.677
YOUR S. Y. L. USA IS THAT SALES

00:25:45.744 --> 00:25:46.311
OUR TO PROVIDE A LOT OF FUNDING

00:25:46.378 --> 00:25:49.080
FOR THOSE. AS IN SO. WE DON'T

00:25:49.147 --> 00:25:51.116
THINK ANOTHER ROUND OF FUNDING

00:25:51.182 --> 00:25:53.752
IS NEEDED AT THIS TIME. OUR

00:25:53.818 --> 00:25:55.921
OTHER CONCERN IS THAT WE THINK

00:25:55.987 --> 00:25:57.489
THIS BUDGET MISSES AN

00:25:57.555 --> 00:25:59.524
OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD MORE-

00:25:59.591 --> 00:26:00.992
SCHOOL BUDGET RESILIENCY SO

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:03.628
SPECIFICALLY LEAVING TWO POINT

00:26:03.695 --> 00:26:05.664
SIX BILLION AGAIN DEFERRALS

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:08.033
REMAINING AND- NOT NOT

00:26:08.099 --> 00:26:09.601
PROVIDING ANY ADDITIONAL

00:26:09.668 --> 00:26:11.336
FUNDING. I TRIED UNFUNDED

00:26:11.403 --> 00:26:13.805
PENSION COSTS WE THINK THAT

00:26:13.872 --> 00:26:15.407
ADDRESSING BOTH OF THOSE ISSUES

00:26:15.473 --> 00:26:16.775
THAT WOULD BENEFIT STUDENTS BY

00:26:16.841 --> 00:26:18.343
INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:19.477
THE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES

00:26:19.544 --> 00:26:21.913
DISTRICTS I CREATE THIS YEAR I

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.415
WITH ONE TIME FUNDING CAN BE

00:26:23.481 --> 00:26:24.983
SUSTAINED OVER TIME. BUT ALSO

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:26.518
PREPARE DISTRICTS IN THE STATE

00:26:26.584 --> 00:26:27.819
TO BETTER DEAL WITH THE NEXT

00:26:27.886 --> 00:26:29.654
ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND SO WE

00:26:29.721 --> 00:26:31.156
THINK SHIFTING FUNDING LOOK AT

00:26:31.222 --> 00:26:32.657
MORE IN THAT DIRECTION. WITH

00:26:32.724 --> 00:26:34.125
WOULD BE A VERY GOOD WAY TO-

00:26:34.192 --> 00:26:37.529
IMPROVE UPON ON THE PACKAGE

00:26:37.595 --> 00:26:39.898
BEFORE YOU. I SO WITH THAT-

00:26:39.965 --> 00:26:41.066
COLLEAGUES AGAIN COVER A LOT OF

00:26:41.132 --> 00:26:42.067
THESE ISSUES IN MORE DETAIL

00:26:42.133 --> 00:26:44.402
WHAT IMPACT CAPITA ANSWER ANY

00:26:44.469 --> 00:26:46.438

EXCEL. WE WERE JUST REQUEST

00:27:32.717 --> 00:27:33.451
THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:27:33.518 --> 00:27:34.419

PROGRAMS AS FOR THE LCS IN

00:27:37.555 --> 00:27:39.324
SPECIAL EDUCATION PARTICULARLY

THE EXTENT THAT ADDITIONAL

00:27:39.924 --> 00:27:42.794
REVENUES ARE IDENTIFIED. I'M

00:27:42.861 --> 00:27:43.294

00:27:43.361 --> 00:27:44.629

THANK YOU VERY MUCH BOMB. I'M

00:27:47.365 --> 00:27:48.833

FINANCE BUT IT'S MORE A BRIEF

00:27:51.202 --> 00:27:53.171
STATEMENT TO AND THEN COMMENT

00:27:53.238 --> 00:27:55.473
ON IT. IT AND IT JUST BASICALLY

00:27:55.540 --> 00:28:00.211
WITH- OF. THE RECORD REVENUES-

00:28:00.278 --> 00:28:02.981
THAT- ONE TIME WAS PROP NINETY

00:28:03.048 --> 00:28:04.649
EIGHT WHY NOT PAY OFF THE

00:28:04.716 --> 00:28:06.618
DIFFERENCE BECAUSE IT SEEMS

00:28:06.684 --> 00:28:09.387
THAT. THE INFERENCES SO WE'LL

00:28:09.454 --> 00:28:10.822
HAVE MORE THAN THAT IN THE

00:28:10.889 --> 00:28:13.958
EDUCATION OF RAINY DAY FUND.

00:28:14.025 --> 00:28:16.995
AND IF THE ECONOMY TANKS OR

00:28:17.062 --> 00:28:19.130
REVENUES GO DOWN WE'RE GOING TO

00:28:19.197 --> 00:28:20.131
NEED THE MONEY IN THAT FUND TO

00:28:20.198 --> 00:28:22.967
BRIDGE L. E. H. NOT TO PAY OFF

00:28:23.034 --> 00:28:24.369
DEFERRALS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE

00:28:24.436 --> 00:28:26.638
PAID. OFF WHEN WE HAVE THE

00:28:26.704 --> 00:28:28.573
BIGGEST ONE TIME MONEY IN THE

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.041
HISTORY OF PROP NINETY EIGHT

00:28:30.108 --> 00:28:33.378
SO. WHY WAS THE CHOICE MADE TO

00:28:33.445 --> 00:28:35.213
NOT PAY OFF THE DEFERRALS AND-

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.015
RELY IN THE FUTURE MAY BE ON

00:28:37.082 --> 00:28:40.652
THE RAINY DAY FUND WHEN WE HAVE

00:28:40.718 --> 00:28:42.053
THIS BIG AMOUNT OF MONEY.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.755
CERTAINLY HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT

00:28:43.822 --> 00:28:47.125
AREA BERMAN FINANCE AGAIN. SO

00:28:47.192 --> 00:28:49.694
THE WAY THAT WE I THOUGHT ABOUT

00:28:49.761 --> 00:28:51.062
IT IS A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS

00:28:51.129 --> 00:28:52.797
SO YOU MENTIONED THE- THE

00:28:52.864 --> 00:28:54.165
INCREASE IN ONE TIME FUNDING

00:28:54.232 --> 00:28:55.967
AND THAT'S TRUE BUT I WOULD SAY

00:28:56.034 --> 00:28:57.869
THAT TO SOME EXTENT THAT'S-

00:28:57.936 --> 00:28:59.971
EXACTLY WHY. THE DEFERRALS BE

00:29:00.038 --> 00:29:00.905
MAINTAINING THE AMOUNT THAT IT

00:29:00.972 --> 00:29:02.540
IS BECAUSE SHOULD WE MOVE TO A

00:29:02.607 --> 00:29:04.843
FUTURE YEAR- WHICH GENERALLY

00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:06.344
WILL ENSURE THE ECONOMY FARE

00:29:06.411 --> 00:29:07.812
POORER THAN WE ARE CURRENTLY

00:29:07.879 --> 00:29:09.747
EXPECTING AS YOU MENTION- THE

00:29:09.814 --> 00:29:11.483
WAY THAT THE- RAINY DAY RESERVE

00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:13.551
DEPOSITS WORK. IN THE FIRST

00:29:13.618 --> 00:29:15.120
INITIAL TWO YEARS AFTER THEY

00:29:15.186 --> 00:29:16.488
ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED DESERVES A

00:29:16.554 --> 00:29:18.656
TRUCK MECHANISM. SO THOSE

00:29:18.723 --> 00:29:19.557
APOSTLES ARE MADE BUT TO THE

00:29:19.624 --> 00:29:22.794
EXTENT THAT- THINGS CHANGE AND

00:29:22.861 --> 00:29:24.095
IN THE ECONOMY AND THOSE ARE NO

00:29:24.162 --> 00:29:26.831
LONGER NEEDED- THERE COULD BE.

00:29:26.898 --> 00:29:28.299
AN IMMEDIATE JUST REDUCTION AND

00:29:28.366 --> 00:29:30.568
ALL THAT SO IT'S ESSENTIALLY WE

00:29:30.635 --> 00:29:32.036
BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A ONE TIME

00:29:32.103 --> 00:29:34.672
COST. IT FREES UP MONEY. IN THE

00:29:34.739 --> 00:29:36.941
FUTURE BY IN A LIGHT COME OUT-

00:29:37.008 --> 00:29:39.010
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT ECONOMIC

00:29:39.077 --> 00:29:40.311
INDICATORS CHANGE SO MUCH THAT

00:29:40.378 --> 00:29:41.880
THERE WAS ACTUALLY REQUIRED

00:29:41.946 --> 00:29:42.280
WITHDRAWAL PER THE

00:29:42.347 --> 00:29:43.915
CONSTITUTIONAL LANGUAGE. BUT

00:29:43.982 --> 00:29:45.817
AGAIN THAT WOULD HELP US. AS

00:29:45.884 --> 00:29:47.719
WELL AND I THINK FROM A LARGER

00:29:47.785 --> 00:29:50.355
GLOBAL- ENTIRE BUDGET

00:29:50.421 --> 00:29:52.023
PERSPECTIVE. WE REALLY LOOKED

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:53.525
AT OKAY BETWEEN THE MAKES OF

00:29:53.591 --> 00:29:54.859
ONE TIME AND ONGOING FUNDING

00:29:54.926 --> 00:29:58.963
WHAT'S WHAT'S GOING. TO ALLOW

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:00.565
US TO- REALLY PRIMARY. ME

00:30:00.632 --> 00:30:02.700
RESOURCES AS WE COULD TOWARDS

00:30:02.767 --> 00:30:03.535
LIKE I SAID EARLIER THOSE

00:30:03.601 --> 00:30:04.836
COMMUNITIES MOST IN NEED OF IT

00:30:04.903 --> 00:30:05.970
ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE

00:30:06.037 --> 00:30:07.739
PANDEMIC WHILE ALSO SHORING UP.

00:30:07.805 --> 00:30:09.073
DISTRICT BUDGETS THROUGH A

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.109
PROVIDING A LARGER COLO FIVE

00:30:11.176 --> 00:30:13.144
POINT 007% ON THE LC FIVE WHICH

00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:15.446
IT IMPROVES FUNDING. FOR EVERY

00:30:15.513 --> 00:30:16.481
DISTRICT EVEN THOSE WHO MAY NOT

00:30:16.548 --> 00:30:18.783
RECEIVE. LARGE SUPPLEMENTAL AND

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:21.953
CONCENTRATION GRANTS PERCENTAGE

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.556
AMOUNTS- DOT DOT I THINK WAS

00:30:24.622 --> 00:30:26.124
DEFINITELY AN ADDITIONAL

00:30:26.191 --> 00:30:28.760
CONSIDERATION. AS WELL AND I

00:30:28.826 --> 00:30:31.029
THINK ON A CASH BASIS- THIS IS

00:30:31.095 --> 00:30:33.631
JUST A JUNE TO JULY DEFERRAL

00:30:33.698 --> 00:30:36.167
AND ESPECIALLY IN THE IN THIS

00:30:36.234 --> 00:30:37.435
YEAR AND NEXT YEAR IS VERY

00:30:37.502 --> 00:30:39.137
LIKELY WITH SO MUCH MONEY THAT

00:30:39.204 --> 00:30:40.238
MEETING ELEAZAR RECEIVING FROM

00:30:40.305 --> 00:30:41.372
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL

00:30:41.439 --> 00:30:43.508
AS FROM US AT THE STATE- THAT

00:30:43.575 --> 00:30:45.376
MANY. DISTRICTS ARE LIKELY TO

00:30:45.443 --> 00:30:47.579
BE IN A RELATIVELY STRONG CASH

00:30:47.645 --> 00:30:49.214
POSITION AND SO WE DON'T

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.616
FORESEE THIS AS- SOMETHING THAT

00:30:51.683 --> 00:30:54.752
WOULD. REALLY BE. TO MUCH OF A

00:30:54.819 --> 00:30:56.287
HARDSHIP FOR THEM IF AT ALL AND

00:30:56.354 --> 00:30:58.823
WE ARE STILL MAINTAINING- THE

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:00.558
DEFERRAL EXEMPTION FOR THE

00:31:00.625 --> 00:31:03.761
MONTH OF JUNE. FOR THOSE EARLY

00:31:03.828 --> 00:31:05.396
AS THAT WOULD. DEMONSTRATE THAT

00:31:05.463 --> 00:31:06.965
IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE A CASH

00:31:07.031 --> 00:31:08.132
HARDSHIP FOR THEM WHEN THE TIME

00:31:08.199 --> 00:31:10.068
COMES FOR THAT TO FOR ALSO ALL

00:31:10.134 --> 00:31:12.203
OF THOSE THINGS IN CONTACTS IS

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:15.773
WHAT LED US TO- MAINTAIN THAT

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:16.374
THAT AMOUNT OF THE FOR ALL THE

00:31:16.441 --> 00:31:19.344
BUDGET YEAR. I APPRECIATE THAT.

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:21.679
BUT I DO DISAGREE JUST BECAUSE

00:31:21.746 --> 00:31:23.715
I WAS BUDGET CHAIR AT A TIME.

00:31:23.781 --> 00:31:25.083
WHEN WE WERE UNDER WATER THE

00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:27.018
WHOLE TIME AND BORROWED A AND

00:31:27.085 --> 00:31:29.287
IT TOOK GOVERNOR BROWN FIGURING

00:31:29.354 --> 00:31:32.323
OUT HOW TO GET US OUT OF DEBT.

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:33.958
OF BECAUSE SO MUCH HAD BEEN

00:31:34.025 --> 00:31:35.660
ACCUMULATED AND JUST WHEN WE

00:31:35.727 --> 00:31:37.095
HAVE THE MOST MONEY THAT WE'VE

00:31:37.161 --> 00:31:38.930
HAD ABOVE PROJECTIONS IN MODERN

00:31:38.997 --> 00:31:40.598
TIMES IT'S A TIME TO PAY OFF

00:31:40.665 --> 00:31:47.605
DEBT. THEN SO- HE YOU KNOW WHAT

00:31:47.672 --> 00:31:49.274
I. MORGES HEARING THIS WAY

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:50.275

CONVERSATION BECAUSE I THINK

00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:56.381
IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO DO.

00:31:56.447 --> 00:31:58.816
ARE THERE OTHER QUESTIONS ON

00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:38.322
THE SIDE OF. OKAY CENTERMAN-

00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:44.995
AND YOUR MARK. SO I GUESS- MY

00:42:45.062 --> 00:42:47.064
FIRST QUESTION A COMMENT

00:42:47.131 --> 00:42:47.798
ACTUALLY THIS IS MORE OF A

00:42:47.865 --> 00:42:50.834
COMMENT IS JUST AROUND THE HOLD

00:42:50.901 --> 00:42:53.270
HARMLESS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY

00:42:53.337 --> 00:42:53.904
ONE TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO SCHOOL

00:42:53.971 --> 00:42:56.507
YEAR. AND I WOULD JUST

00:42:56.573 --> 00:42:59.343
EMPHASIZE- WHILE I BELIEVE THAT

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:01.512
IT IS SAFE TO RESUME PHYSICAL

00:43:01.578 --> 00:43:03.547
INSTRUCTIONS AT THIS POINT

00:43:03.614 --> 00:43:04.281
BARRING ANY SETS MAJOR

00:43:04.348 --> 00:43:06.717
SETBACKS. AND WHILE I PLAN TO

00:43:06.784 --> 00:43:08.919
SEND MY KIDS TO SCHOOL. AND I

00:43:08.986 --> 00:43:10.220
WELL I THINK IT IS AN

00:43:10.287 --> 00:43:11.922
ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT THAT.

00:43:11.989 --> 00:43:14.391
EVERY L. EA AND EVERY SCHOOL

00:43:14.458 --> 00:43:16.760
ACROSS THE STATE OFFER PHYSICAL

00:43:16.827 --> 00:43:18.996
IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AS THE

00:43:19.063 --> 00:43:21.832
DEFAULT. STARTING THIS FALL. I

00:43:21.899 --> 00:43:23.133
ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS HOLD

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.636
HARMLESS PROVISION IS IMPORTANT

00:43:25.703 --> 00:43:27.604
FOR OFFERING. VIRTUAL

00:43:27.671 --> 00:43:30.174
INSTRUCTION TO THOSE PARENTS

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:33.344
WHO MAY. NOT FEEL THAT THEY'RE

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:35.312
NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE RISKS

00:43:35.379 --> 00:43:35.946
OF SENDING THEIR KIDS BACK TO

00:43:36.013 --> 00:43:37.948
PHYSICAL CLASSROOM AND I WOULD

00:43:38.015 --> 00:43:39.950
NOTE THAT WHEN I TALKED TO I

00:43:40.017 --> 00:43:40.985
KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF BACK AND

00:43:41.051 --> 00:43:42.653
FORTH ABOUT THIS BUT WHEN I

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:46.523
TALKED. A TRUSTED ACADEMIC

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:48.492
RESEARCHERS THAT'S WHAT I'M

00:43:48.559 --> 00:43:49.760
TOLD IS THAT WE JUST DON'T HAVE

00:43:49.827 --> 00:43:51.362
ENOUGH DATA YET TO MAKE

00:43:51.428 --> 00:43:53.297
ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN

00:43:53.364 --> 00:43:54.298
PROCLAMATIONS ABOUT SCHOOL RE

00:43:54.365 --> 00:43:56.200
OPENINGS. MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE

00:43:56.266 --> 00:43:57.701
THAT IT'S SAFE TO SEND OUR KIDS

00:43:57.768 --> 00:43:59.770
BACK TO SCHOOL BUT THE BUT THE

00:43:59.837 --> 00:44:01.472
CERTAINTY AROUND THAT IS NOT A

00:44:01.538 --> 00:44:03.574
100% OR AT THAT LEVELS AT THIS

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:06.010
POINT. ARKANSAS I WOULD JUST

00:44:06.076 --> 00:44:07.578
EMPHASIZE THAT THERE ARE

00:44:07.644 --> 00:44:10.514
PARENTS OUT THERE. THAT DAY FOR

00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:11.648
WHATEVER REASON THEIR OWN

00:44:11.715 --> 00:44:13.384
FULLER MEDICAL VULNERABILITIES

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:15.753
OR OR WHATNOT ARE NOT

00:44:15.819 --> 00:44:17.187
COMFORTABLE SAYING THE KIDS

00:44:17.254 --> 00:44:19.556
BACK TO PHYSICAL CLASSROOMS-

00:44:19.623 --> 00:44:21.992
ANIES ARE NOT IRRATIONAL PEOPLE

00:44:22.059 --> 00:44:23.460
THAT THE FALL YOU KNOW ON ONE

00:44:23.527 --> 00:44:25.496
END OF THE RANGE OF BELIEFS OUT

00:44:25.562 --> 00:44:27.698
THERE- BUT BUT I DON'T THINK

00:44:27.765 --> 00:44:29.033
THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE WE

00:44:29.099 --> 00:44:30.267
SHOULD FORCE THOSE PARENTS TO

00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:31.068
SEND THEIR KIDS BACK TO

00:44:31.135 --> 00:44:33.003
PHYSICAL. CLASSROOMS AND SO I

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:34.538
WOULD EMPHASIZE THAT THIS HOLD

00:44:34.605 --> 00:44:35.906
HARMLESS PROVISIONS IMPORTANT

00:44:35.973 --> 00:44:40.744
AND I WANT. TO ST MY STATE MY

00:44:40.811 --> 00:44:42.913
STRONG SUPPORT FOR IT- MY SAID.

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.715
I GUESS MY ACTUAL CLASS AND

00:44:44.782 --> 00:44:45.883
I'LL PROBABLY **** ON THE NEXT

00:44:45.949 --> 00:44:48.852
PANEL WELL- BUT EITHER FOR THE

00:44:48.919 --> 00:44:49.620
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OR THE

00:44:49.686 --> 00:44:53.290
PERMIT. YOU KNOW WE SEEM TO BE

00:44:53.357 --> 00:44:54.958
PUSHING A LOT OF MONEY TOWARDS

00:44:55.025 --> 00:44:56.894
HELPING SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT

00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:00.064
HAVE HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF-

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:01.865
LOW INCOME ENGLISH LEARNER AND

00:45:01.932 --> 00:45:03.634
FOSTER CHILDREN AND I THINK

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:05.235
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY

00:45:05.302 --> 00:45:06.670
BUT I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IT

00:45:06.737 --> 00:45:08.572
IS. HAVE YOU GUYS CALCULATED

00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:10.274
WHAT THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:11.408
ALL THIS IS BECAUSE AT SOME

00:45:11.475 --> 00:45:13.210
POINT WE ALSO MAKE SURE THAT

00:45:13.277 --> 00:45:14.011
ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS HAVE ENOUGH

00:45:14.078 --> 00:45:16.914
FUNDING FOR THEIR BASIC NEEDS.

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:18.148
AND WHEN I SEE A LOT OF

00:45:18.215 --> 00:45:20.217
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS STACKED ON

00:45:20.284 --> 00:45:21.418
TOP OF PROGRAMS THAT ALREADY

00:45:21.485 --> 00:45:23.554
EXIST TO TOE SPECIFICALLY

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:25.689
ALLOCATE FUNDS TO THESE THESE

00:45:25.756 --> 00:45:28.659
PARTICULAR ALLEY AS- OR SCHOOLS

00:45:28.725 --> 00:45:30.160
BOB I GUESS THAT MAKES ME

00:45:30.227 --> 00:45:31.295
WONDER SIR WHAT WHAT'S THE

00:45:31.361 --> 00:45:33.130
TOTAL AMOUNT THAT THAT THIS IS

00:45:33.197 --> 00:45:35.899
A 75% CONCENTRATION SCHOOL

00:45:35.966 --> 00:45:38.001
MIGHT GET THESE A V. A SCHOOL

00:45:38.068 --> 00:45:40.037
THAT HAS FORTY NINE PERCENT-

00:45:40.104 --> 00:45:41.438
AND HOW ARE WE LOOKING AT THE

00:45:41.505 --> 00:45:42.506
BIG PICTURE ON THE TALKING

00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:43.640
ABOUT THE NEEDS OF OUR SCHOOLS

00:45:43.707 --> 00:45:45.476
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW

00:45:45.542 --> 00:45:47.878
SCHOOLS THEY HAVE 40% 49% LOW

00:45:47.945 --> 00:45:49.847
INCOME FOSTER KIDS ENGLISH

00:45:49.913 --> 00:45:51.682
LEARNERS MANY OF THEM ARE

RECEIVED. THOSE BILLIONS UPON

00:49:28.365 --> 00:49:29.766
BILLIONS WERE DOLED OUT LARGELY

00:49:29.833 --> 00:49:34.171

EXPANDED LEARNING TIME WHICH WE

00:50:09.639 --> 00:50:11.541
WILL TALK ABOUT LATER ON IS

ELLIOTT RECEIVED THOSE THAT

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:32.596

MONEY WOULDN'T HAVE NOT SEEN

00:50:38.135 --> 00:50:40.604

I DON'T YOU GUYS LOOK AT THE

00:51:23.413 --> 00:51:24.214

THE PRIORITIES HERE TO JUST

00:51:39.796 --> 00:51:40.530
INCREASE THE BASE FUNDING

00:51:40.597 --> 00:51:42.132
LITTLE BIT MORE. AND MAYBE

00:51:42.199 --> 00:51:43.800
PROVIDE LESS MONEY SO I GUESS

00:51:43.867 --> 00:51:44.734
I'M REALLY JUST LOOKING FOR THE

00:51:44.801 --> 00:51:46.503
JUSTIFICATION HOW MUCH OF THIS

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:48.104
IS NEEDED AS WORK THINKING

00:51:48.171 --> 00:51:48.705
ABOUT THE BROADER BIG PICTURE

00:51:48.772 --> 00:51:50.574

FINANCE MAYBE ASTOR

00:52:04.287 --> 00:52:06.156
CONCENTRATION GRANT QUESTION A

00:52:06.223 --> 00:52:08.792
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY. WHICH

00:52:08.859 --> 00:52:12.329
IS AWESOME- WHY IS ADDITIONAL

00:52:12.395 --> 00:52:13.830
STAFFING TIED TO THE

00:52:13.897 --> 00:52:15.365
CONSERVATION I MEAN THE

00:52:15.432 --> 00:52:17.334
CONCENTRATION GRANT DIVISIONAL

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:19.202
STAFF IS NEEDED WHY NOT CREATE

00:52:19.269 --> 00:52:21.004
A SEPARATE PROGRAM AND TARGET

00:52:21.071 --> 00:52:23.740
STAFF TO SPECIFIC SCHOOLS OR

00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:27.410
FOR SPECIFIC NEEDS. SO CHANGE

00:52:27.477 --> 00:52:28.812
YOUR QUESTION CENTER WHERE I

00:52:28.879 --> 00:52:30.046
THINK OUR THINKING WITH OUR

00:52:30.113 --> 00:52:33.450
PROPOSAL IS THAT- THE L. CAP IS

00:52:33.517 --> 00:52:35.418
ALREADY PART OF THE LCS PFAFF

00:52:35.485 --> 00:52:36.820
IN THE LOCAL STAKEHOLDER

00:52:36.887 --> 00:52:38.388
ENGAGEMENT PROCESS MAKING SURE

00:52:38.455 --> 00:52:40.390
THE ELEAZAR ARE REALLY TAKING

00:52:40.457 --> 00:52:41.925
INTO ACCOUNT THEIR LOCAL

00:52:41.992 --> 00:52:42.926
COMMUNITY NEEDS THE NEEDS OF

00:52:42.993 --> 00:52:44.327
THEIR STUDENTS. AND SOME BY

00:52:44.394 --> 00:52:46.596
FOLDING THIS FUNDING INTO THE

00:52:46.663 --> 00:52:48.098
ALSO HAVE A CONCENTRATION GRANT

00:52:48.164 --> 00:52:49.432
IN KEY INCREASE FOR THOSE

00:52:49.499 --> 00:52:50.667
SCHOOLS WITH THE HIGHEST

00:52:50.734 --> 00:52:53.069
CONCENTRATION OF SAID HIGH NEED

00:52:53.136 --> 00:52:55.572
STUDENTS- WE'RE TYING IT INTO

00:52:55.639 --> 00:52:57.407
THAT EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE OF

00:52:57.474 --> 00:52:59.276
THE ALL CAP NOT CREATING SO YET

00:52:59.342 --> 00:53:02.746
ANOTHER- SILO TO PROGRAM

00:53:02.812 --> 00:53:04.347
OUTSIDE OF THE L. C. F. ASK.

00:53:04.414 --> 00:53:05.682
THAT NOW DISTRICTS ARE HAVING

00:53:05.749 --> 00:53:07.617
TO COMPLY WITH WE FELT THAT

00:53:07.684 --> 00:53:08.818
ROLLING IT INTO THE LCF I'VE

00:53:08.885 --> 00:53:10.353
REALLY MAKES IT MOST CONSISTENT

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:12.856
WITH OF COURSE THE IMAGES OF

00:53:12.923 --> 00:53:15.158
LOCAL CONTROL ETCETERA- SO THAT

00:53:15.225 --> 00:53:17.027
DISTRICTS THAT RECEIVE THIS

00:53:17.093 --> 00:53:21.798
FUNDING. ARE ABLE TO- REALLY

00:53:21.865 --> 00:53:22.832
BETTER ALIGNED WITH ALL THEIR

00:53:22.899 --> 00:53:24.834
OLD ARCHING L. PER. AND HAVE A

00:53:24.901 --> 00:53:27.237
LIVE SOME ELSE OF THAT WELL. I

00:53:27.304 --> 00:53:29.906
APPRECIATE THAT IT THE SAME

00:53:29.973 --> 00:53:32.475
TIME. IT MEANS THAT SCHOOLS

00:53:32.542 --> 00:53:33.944
THAT MIGHT HAVE A NEED- OUTSIDE

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:35.645
OF IT BECAUSE IT IS JUST

00:53:35.712 --> 00:53:36.746
TARGETED TO THE EXISTING

00:53:36.813 --> 00:53:38.748
STRUCTURE AND I GET TO DECIDE

00:53:38.815 --> 00:53:39.683
WHAT WAS BEST A BUT I THINK

00:53:39.749 --> 00:53:41.851
THAT'S- THAT'S THE PROBLEM AND

00:53:41.918 --> 00:53:43.286
MAYBE WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT

00:53:43.353 --> 00:53:45.388
IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. I THINK

00:53:45.455 --> 00:53:50.060
THE THIS ITEM R. A. I WANT TO

00:53:50.126 --> 00:53:53.163
ASK THE AND ALSO A LITTLE TOO

00:53:53.229 --> 00:53:54.864
TO WHAT SENATOR MEN SAID ABOUT

00:53:54.931 --> 00:53:59.202
SCHOOL RE OPENING BECAUSE- AND-

00:53:59.269 --> 00:54:00.870
JUST AS A COMMENT BECAUSE I

00:54:00.937 --> 00:54:01.905
READ THE EXCHANGE IN THE

00:54:01.972 --> 00:54:03.873
ASSEMBLY AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:06.276
FALSE CHOICE. A QUESTION ABOUT

00:54:06.343 --> 00:54:09.145
WHETHER- WHAT IS PROPOSED WOULD

00:54:09.212 --> 00:54:11.214
ALLOW 90% OF STUDENTS NOT TO

00:54:11.281 --> 00:54:12.983
COME BACK IN SOME DISTRICT AND

00:54:13.049 --> 00:54:14.851
I THINK THAT'S THE WORST FEARS.

00:54:14.918 --> 00:54:16.219
OF SOME PEOPLE THAT WANT

00:54:16.286 --> 00:54:18.021
SCHOOLS TO COME BACK IN PERSON

00:54:18.088 --> 00:54:19.289
AND YET THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE I

00:54:19.356 --> 00:54:21.291
DON'T THINK ANYBODY SUGGESTING

00:54:21.358 --> 00:54:22.993
ANYWHERE THAT 90% OF THE

00:54:23.059 --> 00:54:24.861
STUDENTS IN ANY DISTRICT WON'T

00:54:24.928 --> 00:54:27.397
COME BACK. I THINK IT'S A

00:54:27.464 --> 00:54:29.466
FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE. THAT THERE

00:54:29.532 --> 00:54:30.834
ARE SOME PLACES AND THERE'S A

00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.502
STORY I THINK AT THIS MORNING'S

00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:34.504
LA TIMES IT'S IN THE NEWS THIS

00:54:34.571 --> 00:54:37.107
MORNING ABOUT PICO RIVERA. AND

00:54:37.173 --> 00:54:39.242
THE LOS THEY HAD THEIR- MUCH

00:54:39.309 --> 00:54:40.877
COVETED AND THE FACT THAT

00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:43.313
PEOPLE AREN'T READY. SOME TO

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:45.515
COME BACK PERSONALLY DOING IT

00:54:45.582 --> 00:54:47.917
BECAUSE OF THAT. AND WE SHOULD

00:54:47.984 --> 00:54:49.953
NOT DRIVE THOSE PARENTS OUT OF

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:51.554
THE SYSTEM AND WE SHOULD NOT

00:54:51.621 --> 00:54:53.123
HAVE TO FUND THE LOSS OF

00:54:53.189 --> 00:54:55.225
ENROLLMENT OTHER SCHOOLS AND SO

00:54:55.291 --> 00:54:56.926
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. AND I

00:54:56.993 --> 00:54:59.496
THINK WHAT THE DETAILS STILL

00:54:59.562 --> 00:55:01.531
HAVE TO BE TALKED ABOUT. THE

00:55:01.598 --> 00:55:02.699
NOTION THAT THERE'S A

00:55:02.766 --> 00:55:04.100
REQUIREMENT THAT PEOPLE COME

00:55:04.167 --> 00:55:06.469
BACK BUT THE OPTION. IF PEOPLE

00:55:06.536 --> 00:55:08.071
COME BACK AND NOT IN PERSON IS

00:55:08.138 --> 00:55:09.205
STILL REQUIREMENT FOR

00:55:09.272 --> 00:55:10.507
INDEPENDENT STUDY AND IT'S

00:55:10.573 --> 00:55:11.808
STILL MONITORED AND YOU CAN

00:55:11.875 --> 00:55:13.877
STILL DEAL WITH ADA. IS THE

00:55:13.943 --> 00:55:15.412
RIGHT WAY TO DO IT AND WE

00:55:15.478 --> 00:55:17.147
SHOULD NOT BE DRIVING PEOPLE ON

00:55:17.213 --> 00:55:18.948
THE MARGINS OUT OF THE PUBLIC

00:55:19.015 --> 00:55:20.283
SCHOOL SYSTEM AFTER THIS

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:22.619
HAPPENED SO. WHILE THERE MIGHT

00:55:22.686 --> 00:55:23.987
BE SOME THE DETAILS TO STILL

00:55:24.054 --> 00:55:25.455
TALK ABOUT I THINK THE GENERAL

00:55:25.522 --> 00:55:26.990
DIRECTION OF THE BUDGET. TO

00:55:27.057 --> 00:55:28.458
ALLOW FOR INDEPENDENT STUDIES

00:55:28.525 --> 00:55:30.593
AND THAT IS A GOOD ONE AND SO

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:32.429
WE SHOULD JUST WORK THAT OUT.

00:55:32.495 --> 00:55:34.431
AND THEN A MORE GLOBAL COMMENT

00:55:34.497 --> 00:55:35.832
BECAUSE EVERYTHING FITS

00:55:35.899 --> 00:55:38.401
TOGETHER HERE. WE HAVE ONE

00:55:38.468 --> 00:55:41.905
ITEM. ABOUT SPECIAL OF PROGRAMS

00:55:41.971 --> 00:55:47.844
THAT'S THAT STILL TO COME. AND.

00:55:47.911 --> 00:55:48.678
SOME OF THEM ARE TO BE STOOD UP.

00:55:48.745 --> 00:55:50.513
IN WHO THE MONEY ON THE RECALL

00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:51.748
REPORTING ON DISTRICTS THERE'S

00:55:51.815 --> 00:55:53.516
A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THEY

00:55:53.583 --> 00:55:56.319
CAN GET THE MOP. BOB BARR IN

00:55:56.386 --> 00:55:58.188
TIME WHEN THERE'S A ONE TIME

00:55:58.254 --> 00:56:01.224
MONEY AND WE WANT TO SPEND IT-

00:56:01.291 --> 00:56:03.893
BEFORE. THE REQUIREMENTS

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.061
PARTICULAR ON THE FEDERAL MONEY

00:56:05.128 --> 00:56:07.163
THAT THAT MIGHT LIMIT ITS

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:08.998
ABILITY TO BE SPENT OVERTIME.

00:56:09.065 --> 00:56:10.934
AND SO EVEN THOUGH THAT'S A

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.168
CONVERSATION TO HAVE ABOUT

00:56:12.235 --> 00:56:13.837
THEIR IT RAISES THE ISSUES

00:56:13.903 --> 00:56:15.505
ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WE DON'T

00:56:15.572 --> 00:56:17.607
HAVE THAT THE BUDGET FOR. R.

00:56:17.674 --> 00:56:21.077
ELIA IS FOR EXAMPLE. EITHER A

00:56:35.091 --> 00:56:36.392
TROUBLE GETTING MONEY OUT THE

00:56:39.796 --> 00:56:42.766
THINGS IN THIS. AND WHILE THAT

ITEMS THESE ALL FIT TOGETHER

00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:48.671

RACES HERE AND JUST SAY THAT

00:56:50.774 --> 00:56:52.208

INCLUDING BACK BEING CLINIC

01:06:47.837 --> 01:06:50.106

AND ALSO PROTECT. ABOUT WHEN.

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:56.278
THE LAST THING I WANT TO KNOW

01:06:56.345 --> 01:06:59.081
IS THAT BOTH OF THAT IN A

01:06:59.148 --> 01:07:01.917
PROPOSAL THAT I WITH THE- IS

01:07:01.984 --> 01:07:03.586
THAT AS MAJORITY OF I DON'T.

01:07:03.652 --> 01:07:05.388
FIND THAT HAVE BEEN COMING WENT

01:07:05.454 --> 01:07:07.056
OUT BASED ON PROPORTION OF

01:07:07.123 --> 01:07:09.425
TITLE ALEX. THE COULD NOT GO

OUT TO ALL WE GAVE. THE FUNDING

01:07:11.927 --> 01:07:15.798
FOR PROPOSAL. DOC LEN ON ALTHEA

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:17.066
THOUSAND TITLE MEANT. FOR THE

01:07:17.133 --> 01:07:19.201
INTENTION OF THAT THE PEOPLE.

01:07:19.268 --> 01:07:21.737
AND THAT PEOPLE HOUSES AND LONG

01:07:21.804 --> 01:07:24.039
THAT I BINDING AND TARGET IN A-

01:07:24.106 --> 01:07:26.041
BROWN WILL BE SPREAD OUT MORE.

01:07:26.108 --> 01:07:35.751
ACROSS WITH. ALL OUT. ACTUALLY

01:07:35.818 --> 01:07:38.287
NEED TO GO FOR THAT SO I THINK

01:07:38.354 --> 01:07:38.921
THAT'S GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT

01:07:38.988 --> 01:07:41.457
DISCUSSION. AND THEN MY OTHER

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:43.025
QUESTION IS ON THE EXPANDED

01:07:43.092 --> 01:07:45.694
LEARNING TIME. AND I JUST HAVE

01:07:45.761 --> 01:07:47.196
TO SAY BUREAUCRATICALLY WHEN

01:07:47.263 --> 01:07:50.499
YOU READ THIS. R. IT HAS A CUT

01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:54.670
OFF OF A 55% ENROLLMENT FOR LOW

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:57.006
INCOME ENGLISH LEARNERS AND

01:07:57.072 --> 01:07:59.208
FOSTER YOUTH THAT WOULDN'T GET.

01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:00.643
ANY FUNDING TO PROVIDE THE

01:08:00.709 --> 01:08:02.445
EXPANDED LEARNING TIME FOR

01:08:02.511 --> 01:08:04.380
STUDENTS. AND IT JUST SEEMS

01:08:04.447 --> 01:08:06.615
CRAZY TO ME THAT WE WOULD

01:08:06.682 --> 01:08:09.618
FUNDED PROGRAM ANELLI A WITH

01:08:09.685 --> 01:08:12.087
55% AND THEN IF SOMEBODY HAD

01:08:12.154 --> 01:08:14.957
FIFTY FOUR PERCENT. OF YOUR

01:08:15.024 --> 01:08:16.392
WITH REGARD TO LOW INCOME

01:08:16.459 --> 01:08:18.127
ENGLISH LEARNERS AND FOSTER USE

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:19.328
WOULD SAY OH YOU DON'T GET

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:21.964
FUNDED. ISN'T THERE SOME BETTER

01:08:22.031 --> 01:08:23.699
WAY THAT THERE'S NOT SUCH AN

01:08:23.766 --> 01:08:25.534
ARBITRARY CUT OFF I MEAN

01:08:25.601 --> 01:08:27.736
SCREENING OUT SOMEBODY THAT AS

01:08:27.803 --> 01:08:29.505
54% IN THAT CATEGORY JUST

01:08:29.572 --> 01:08:33.809
DOESN'T SEEM PRODUCTIVE. AND I

01:08:33.876 --> 01:08:34.410
WOULD DIRECT THAT TO THE L. A.

01:08:34.477 --> 01:08:38.180
ALL. RAIMES I I'M SORRY MATTE

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:39.982
FOR FINANCE BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT

01:08:40.049 --> 01:08:42.785
DE LA- WHO'S JUST SCRAMBLING

01:08:42.852 --> 01:08:45.588
THERE WILL WILL HAVE A CONTACT.

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:48.157
IF I COULD HAVE MY UNCLE A-

01:08:48.224 --> 01:08:53.262
BRAWL AS TO THE QUESTION SURE.

01:08:53.329 --> 01:08:55.397
BRAWL WITH THE MATERIAL IF IT

01:08:55.464 --> 01:08:57.266
DIDN'T TO THE SUPERBOWL I THINK

01:08:57.333 --> 01:08:59.435
MILLION. HAS INDICATED THAT THE

01:08:59.502 --> 01:09:01.537
INTENT IS TO PHASE THE PROGRAM

01:09:01.604 --> 01:09:03.239
OVER SEVERAL YEARS. I THINK

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:04.507
THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY THINGS

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:06.442
WHICH WITH BEIJING THE PROGRAM

01:09:06.509 --> 01:09:08.310
MORE TIME HOW I WOULD LOOK I

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:10.679
WOULD AFFECT WHAT WHAT WOULD.

01:09:10.746 --> 01:09:13.349
YOU SAY FIVE YEARS FROM NOW. IN

01:09:13.415 --> 01:09:15.718

MONEY FROM ADDITIONAL FUNDING

01:09:19.522 --> 01:09:20.956
OVERALL BIG PICTURE BIGGER

01:09:21.023 --> 01:09:23.893
THINGS- ON THE THIRD DISTRICTS

01:09:23.959 --> 01:09:25.394
OF HIRING COULD BE WE'VE GOT

01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:27.930
WAS REASONABLE ARE BY. DID YOUR

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:30.032
POINT REGARDING THE ARE THE

01:09:30.099 --> 01:09:31.867
POTENTIAL CLINICAL IS ALREADY

01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:33.102
VERY GOOD SORT OF ARBITRAGE

01:09:33.168 --> 01:09:34.803
PROFITS I THINK I WOULD NOT

01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:36.539
CHOOSE. IN THESE CONVERSATIONS

01:09:36.605 --> 01:09:38.207
ABOUT THE CONCENTRATION GRANT

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:40.075
PARK ROAD NOTE THAT THE

01:09:40.142 --> 01:09:42.077
CONGRESS BRACKETS DID NOT

01:09:42.144 --> 01:09:44.513
CREATE THAT ARBITRARY CUTOFF.

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:47.616
IF YOU ARE A FIFTY FIVE OR 56%

01:09:47.683 --> 01:09:49.552
R. O. U. B. V. SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:51.520
YOU GET CONCENTRATION FUNDING

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:52.755
BUT IT'S VERY VERY SMALL OVER

01:09:52.821 --> 01:09:54.557
TIME THAT WILL MAKE IT BIGGER

01:09:54.623 --> 01:09:55.925
SO WE DON'T HAVE THE SME

01:09:55.991 --> 01:09:57.259
PASSWORD ARBITRATE COOP IN THE

01:09:57.326 --> 01:09:59.995
CORNER ON THE LEFT ARM- WE DO

01:10:00.062 --> 01:10:01.363
OUR- YOUR POINTS ARE NOT

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:14.276
CREATING SOME- LINE WHERE. I.

01:10:14.343 --> 01:10:16.145
ONE POINT. DO YOU CAN YOU GET

01:10:45.274 --> 01:10:46.175
WE'LL WOULD

01:10:46.241 --> 01:10:47.009
BENEFIT FROM THIS EXPANDED

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:48.777
LEARNING TIME NOT REPRESENTS

01:10:48.844 --> 01:10:50.913
ROUGHLY TWO MILLION STUDENT

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:51.780
CHILDREN HAD FULL

01:10:51.847 --> 01:10:53.515
IMPLEMENTATION SO WE DON'T SEE

01:10:53.582 --> 01:10:57.019
THIS AS- REALLY. YOU KNOW I'M

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:59.021
VERY SELECTIVE KIND OF SMALL

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:00.789
POPULATION OF CONCENTRATION

GREAT GENERATING SCHOOLS- THAT

01:11:03.192 --> 01:11:04.693
POPULATION IS QUITE LARGE IN

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:07.930
THE STATE AND- WE WERE JUST

STILL DON'T TOTALLY ADDRESSED

01:12:48.397 --> 01:12:51.433
THE QUESTION BECAUSE- IT'S-

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:54.002
IT'S WELL WE WILL LIMITED MONEY

01:12:54.069 --> 01:12:55.370
AND WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH

01:12:55.437 --> 01:12:56.972
ALL THE PEOPLE. THAT ARE

01:12:57.039 --> 01:12:58.674
ENTIRELY IN THE SCHOOL BUT IF

01:12:58.741 --> 01:13:00.576
YOU HAVE 54% OF THESE

01:13:00.642 --> 01:13:03.245
CHALLENGING. OUR POPULATIONS

01:13:03.312 --> 01:13:05.247
YOU DON'T GET IN THE DOOR AND

01:13:05.314 --> 01:13:08.317
THERE MIGHT BE A BETTER WAY. TO

ACTUALLY TARGET. THAT

01:13:10.753 --> 01:13:13.322
POPULATION BY DISTRICT ABOVE A

01:13:13.388 --> 01:13:16.225
CERTAIN LEVEL THAT'S LOWER- ARE

IT'S BEING PHASED IN OVER FIVE

01:13:24.399 --> 01:13:25.501
YEARS AND I JUST THINK THAT

01:13:25.567 --> 01:13:27.269
NEED TO BE A CONVERSATION ABOUT

01:13:27.336 --> 01:13:28.670

PROPOSAL CREATES REAL WINNERS

01:14:41.677 --> 01:14:45.280

YOU KNOW WHAT WE SUPPORT EQUITY

01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:53.021
I THINK THAT EQUITY HAS TO BE

01:14:53.088 --> 01:14:57.626
TARGETED ON WAYS TO ACTUALLY TO- THE COMMUNITIES THAT

01:14:57.693 --> 01:14:59.194
NEED HELP WHILE ALSO ENSURING

01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:00.929
THAT OUR OUR- SCHOOLS ARE

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:03.398
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. ACROSS THE

01:15:03.465 --> 01:15:05.634
BOARD ARE ARE. YOU NOT HAVING

01:15:05.701 --> 01:15:07.202

THEIR BASELINE REQUIREMENTS.

01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:09.371
AND WE KNOW THERE A LOT OF

01:15:09.438 --> 01:15:11.240
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT EVEN WITH

01:15:11.306 --> 01:15:13.108
A 1% INCREASE ARE ARE GONNA BE

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:16.044
STRUGGLING. ON BOTH THIS FALL

01:15:16.111 --> 01:15:18.614
AND GOING FORWARD. AND SO I

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:20.515
GUESS I JUST ECHO TERMINAL.

01:15:20.582 --> 01:15:22.684
COMMENTS HERE IN AND JUST ASK

01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:23.452
YOU KNOW WHEN WE TAKE A STEP

01:15:23.518 --> 01:15:26.255
BACK. THIS IS A ZERO SUM GAME

01:15:26.321 --> 01:15:27.489
AND WE HAVE FINITE RESOURCES

01:15:27.556 --> 01:15:29.224
AND WE DON'T HAVE THIS I THINK

01:15:29.291 --> 01:15:29.758

CHOICES WERE MAKING AND I DO

01:15:38.033 --> 01:15:38.834

01:15:53.515 --> 01:15:55.517
EVEN LESS THAN THAT. ALSO GET

01:15:55.584 --> 01:15:57.452

DEVELOP A GOOD IN SCHOOL. AND

01:16:02.758 --> 01:16:03.292

CAN. EVERYBODY'S TAKEN A STEP

01:16:35.791 --> 01:16:36.358
BACKWARD AND NOBODY HAS TAKEN A

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:39.394
STEP FORWARD. THE NONE OF US

01:16:39.461 --> 01:16:41.496

CONCENTRATION GRANTS WAS

01:16:54.676 --> 01:16:56.912
ESTABLISHED- BUT I IMAGINE IT

01:16:56.979 --> 01:16:58.880
WAS A LENGTHY POLICY DISCUSSION

01:16:58.947 --> 01:17:00.482
AT THE TIME AS TO WHY THAT CUT

01:17:00.549 --> 01:17:02.684
OFF WAS. DECIDED I WOULD REMIND

01:17:02.751 --> 01:17:04.453
THE COMMITTEE THAT ALL

01:17:06.221 --> 01:17:07.656
SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING ON TOP OF

01:17:07.723 --> 01:17:08.890
THE BASE GRANT AMOUNT WHICH IS

01:17:08.957 --> 01:17:10.859
EQUAL 220% OF THE BASE GRANT

01:17:10.926 --> 01:17:12.694
MULTIPLIED BY ALL OF THEIR ADA-

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:14.196
IN IN EVERY ALLEY A AND THAT'S

01:17:14.262 --> 01:17:16.698
REGARDLESS OF- THAT 55%

01:17:16.765 --> 01:17:19.101
THRESHOLD OR NOT- AND THEN WHEN

01:17:19.167 --> 01:17:21.036
IT COMES TO OUR- MORE RECENT

01:17:21.103 --> 01:17:22.437

01:17:24.573 --> 01:17:25.574
THRESHOLD CONCENTRATION

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:27.509
GROUNDS- THAT'S REALLY LIKE I

01:17:27.576 --> 01:17:30.278
SAID. IN MY PREVIOUS TESTIMONY

01:17:30.345 --> 01:17:32.481
MEANT TO PROVIDE SOME SYNERGY

01:17:32.547 --> 01:17:34.750
BETWEEN THIS NEW PROPOSAL AND

IN THE AWARENESS LIKE THE LCS

01:17:39.721 --> 01:17:40.722
FAST SO THAT WAS REALLY

01:17:40.789 --> 01:17:42.391
THINKING UP UNFORTUNATELY AS TO

01:17:42.457 --> 01:17:44.793
THE- HISTORICAL QUESTION- I

01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:47.129

WITH MUCH EXPERTISE TO THAT

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:50.032

01:17:50.098 --> 01:17:52.401
ELSE CAN READ FROM THE ILIO-

01:17:52.467 --> 01:17:54.903
BUT YEAH THAT'S- THAT'S THE

01:17:54.970 --> 01:17:56.838

YOU VERY. I HAVE A OF. BILL A

01:30:15.243 --> 01:30:16.477
MAJOR. SAID TO WAS GONNA COME

01:30:16.544 --> 01:30:18.446
UP SOME POINT ANYWAY. ADD ON TO

01:30:18.513 --> 01:30:20.047
THE L. A. O.'S COMMENT THAT WAS

01:30:20.114 --> 01:30:22.350
JUST MADE BECAUSE- THERE'S A

01:30:22.416 --> 01:30:23.551
CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT THIS

01:30:23.618 --> 01:30:24.986
BUDGET THROUGHOUT WHAT WE'VE

01:30:25.052 --> 01:30:26.621
DISCUSSED IN THIS HEARING.

01:30:26.687 --> 01:30:28.656
THEIR NUMBER OF NEW PROGRAMS OR

01:30:28.723 --> 01:30:30.291
EXPANDED PROGRAMS AND THE

01:30:30.358 --> 01:30:33.060
QUESTION IS. HOW ARE WE GOING

01:30:33.127 --> 01:30:34.996
TO HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND HOW

01:30:35.062 --> 01:30:35.463
ARE WE GOING TO HAVE A

01:30:35.530 --> 01:30:37.698
VALUATION TO KNOW THAT THE

01:30:37.765 --> 01:30:40.101
MONEY IS LAID OUT. IS ACTUALLY

01:30:40.168 --> 01:30:43.337
BEING EXPANDED AS INTENT AND SO

01:30:43.404 --> 01:30:45.640
I THINK THAT. THAT AS WE MOVE

01:30:45.706 --> 01:30:46.841
TO CLOSE THE BUDGET WE WANT TO

01:30:46.908 --> 01:30:47.742
MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S

01:30:47.809 --> 01:30:49.911
MECHANISMS IN PLACE TO DO THAT

01:30:49.977 --> 01:30:52.880
BECAUSE OF. THE IN THE OUR OUR

01:30:52.947 --> 01:30:54.682
BUDGET HEARINGS ARE DE FACTO

01:30:54.749 --> 01:30:56.818
OVERSIGHT HEARINGS AND WE CAN'T

01:30:56.884 --> 01:30:59.253
HAVE OVERSIGHT UNLESS WE KNOW

01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:01.989
FOR A FACT. THAT WHAT IS

01:31:02.056 --> 01:31:03.691
SUGGESTED IS ACTUALLY BEING

01:31:03.758 --> 01:31:07.428
DONE AND SO- I JUST MAKE THAT

01:31:07.495 --> 01:31:09.564
IS A GLOBAL COMMENT. LET ME ASK

01:31:09.630 --> 01:31:11.966
A QUESTION OF THE- OF DOCTOR

01:31:12.033 --> 01:31:15.703

01:31:19.407 --> 01:31:21.876
FEBRUARY I BELIEVE IT WAS.

01:31:21.943 --> 01:31:23.711
THERE WAS NO DATA YET ON

01:31:23.778 --> 01:31:28.482
RETIREMENTS- OF TEACHERS DURING

01:31:28.549 --> 01:31:31.419
THE PANDEMIC ALL THE STATISTICS

01:31:31.485 --> 01:31:32.720
THE LATEST STATISTICS WERE

01:31:32.787 --> 01:31:34.755
PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC AND I DID

01:31:34.822 --> 01:31:37.358
NOTE THAT IN YOUR COMMENTS

RETIREMENTS IMPLYING TO ME THAT

01:31:41.863 --> 01:31:43.631
THAT THAT DATA STILL DOESN'T

EXIST WHILE THERE WAS SOME

01:31:44.665 --> 01:31:47.501

LOSS OF TEACHERS DURING THE

01:31:56.277 --> 01:31:59.981
PANDEMIC AND COMPARED TO THE

01:32:00.047 --> 01:32:07.154
NORMAL RATE OF ATTRITION. SO I

FINANCE GIVE YOU A GOOD

01:42:25.172 --> 01:42:26.807
OVERVIEW OF WHAT THIS PROPOSAL

01:42:26.874 --> 01:42:29.142
AS- YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER IS

01:42:29.209 --> 01:42:30.277
BACK IN JANUARY THE

01:42:30.344 --> 01:42:31.845
ADMINISTRATION HAS. ALSO HAD A

01:42:31.912 --> 01:42:33.080
PROPOSAL RELATED TO THE

01:42:33.146 --> 01:42:33.614
EXPANSION OF TRANSITIONAL

01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:35.649
KINDERGARTEN- THERE WAS SOME

01:42:35.716 --> 01:42:36.884
ONE TIME INCENTIVE FUNDING FOR

01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:38.552
EXPANDING THE PROGRAM. BUT IT

01:42:38.619 --> 01:42:40.354
WASN'T THERE TO US WHAT THE

01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:41.955
ADMINISTRATION WANTED TO

01:42:42.022 --> 01:42:43.824
ACHIEVE OVER THE LONG RUN- SO I

01:42:43.891 --> 01:42:44.925
THINK THIS MAY REVISION

01:42:44.992 --> 01:42:47.027
IMPROVES UPON THAT BY PROVIDING

01:42:47.094 --> 01:42:49.096
A SPECIFIC- GO ALL AN

01:42:49.162 --> 01:42:50.998
IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE. AND

01:42:51.064 --> 01:42:55.202
SOME TRANSITION FUNDING. THAT'S

01:42:55.269 --> 01:42:55.836
ALIGNED WITH THE PROPOSAL- JUST

01:42:55.903 --> 01:42:58.939
IN TERMS OF THE FIRST- THIS

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:02.676
SIDE OF THIS PROPOSAL. SO THIS

01:43:02.743 --> 01:43:03.944
THIS DECISION TO BE THE

01:43:04.011 --> 01:43:05.279
GUARANTEE ESSENTIALLY THAT IS A

01:43:05.345 --> 01:43:07.281
PROPOSAL TO RE CALIBRATE THE

01:43:07.347 --> 01:43:08.549
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

01:43:08.615 --> 01:43:10.417
FORMULAS OVER TIME IS THAT THEY

01:43:10.484 --> 01:43:11.952
GENERATE MORE FUNDING FOR

01:43:12.019 --> 01:43:13.253
SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:14.888
THAN THEY WOULD OTHERWISE I

01:43:14.955 --> 01:43:16.356
WITH THE IDEA THAT THAT THAT

01:43:16.423 --> 01:43:18.125
ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL COVER-

01:43:18.191 --> 01:43:19.526
THE EVENTUAL TWO POINT SEVEN

01:43:19.593 --> 01:43:22.296
BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN THE

01:43:22.362 --> 01:43:23.530
LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA.

01:43:23.597 --> 01:43:24.398
AND IN THINKING ABOUT THE

01:43:24.464 --> 01:43:26.033
DECISION FOR A BENCHING THAT

01:43:26.099 --> 01:43:28.135
REALLY JUST COMES DOWN TO YOUR-

01:43:28.201 --> 01:43:30.137
OVERALL BUDGET PRIORITIES. OUR

01:43:30.203 --> 01:43:31.538
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

01:43:31.605 --> 01:43:33.674
INCREASE A GUARANTEE LIKE THAT

01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:35.409
IS ALLOWABLE IN THE

01:43:35.475 --> 01:43:38.245
CIRCUMSTANCES. WE DON'T THINK

01:43:38.312 --> 01:43:39.980
IT'S CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED.

01:43:40.047 --> 01:43:41.281
WHAT IT REALLY MEANS IS THAT

01:43:41.348 --> 01:43:42.349
OVER TIME THE STATE WOULD BE

01:43:42.416 --> 01:43:43.650
ABLE TO SPEND MORE ON

01:43:43.717 --> 01:43:44.818
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

01:43:44.885 --> 01:43:47.788
PROGRAMS. AND LESS ON NON

01:43:47.854 --> 01:43:48.322
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

01:43:48.388 --> 01:43:50.791
PROGRAMS. THAT DIFFERS FROM AND

01:43:50.857 --> 01:43:52.859
THE- PROPOSED STAFFING

01:43:52.926 --> 01:43:54.861
REDUCTION PROPOSAL- THAT WOULD

01:43:54.928 --> 01:43:57.264
BE PAID FOR WITH WITH AN

01:43:57.331 --> 01:43:58.966
EXISTING GROWTH IN THE

01:43:59.032 --> 01:43:59.466
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

01:43:59.533 --> 01:44:01.401
GUARANTEE. ARE THERE ARE STILL

01:44:01.468 --> 01:44:03.203
SOME IMPORTANT DETAILS TO BE

01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:04.738
WORKED OUT I THINK THE MOST

01:44:04.805 --> 01:44:07.541
THEM I. WHAT'S THE POINT ONE IS

01:44:07.608 --> 01:44:08.642
THE FUTURE OF THE STATE

01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:09.543
PRESCHOOL PROGRAM THAT

01:44:09.610 --> 01:44:10.711
CURRENTLY SERVES A SIGNIFICANT

01:44:10.777 --> 01:44:12.312
NUMBER OF FOUR YEAR OLDS AND SO

01:44:12.379 --> 01:44:13.714
IT WILL BE IMPORTANT WE THINK

01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:14.982
FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ENGAGE

01:44:15.048 --> 01:44:16.917
IN THAT PROGRAM AND- IN SHAPING

01:44:16.984 --> 01:44:18.051
THE FUTURE OF WHAT THE SCOPE OF

01:44:18.118 --> 01:44:19.486
THAT PROGRAM IS AND WHAT IT

01:44:19.553 --> 01:44:22.956
LOOKS LIKE MOVING FORWARD- BUT

01:44:23.023 --> 01:44:24.491
ALL IN ALL THIS IS I THINK-

01:44:24.558 --> 01:44:25.926
MUCH MORE FLESHED OUT. I THINK

01:44:25.993 --> 01:44:26.727
A PROPOSAL THE MONEY'S ON

01:44:26.793 --> 01:44:29.896

CURRENTLY MANY PARENTS ARE

INSTEAD OF LOSS OF CAPACITY.

01:48:56.930 --> 01:48:57.898
AND THIS WILL REQUIRE PLANNING

01:48:57.964 --> 01:49:01.334
AND INVESTMENT IN THE EXISTING

01:49:01.401 --> 01:49:01.768

HAVE A TRANSITION IN THE WHOLE

01:52:41.721 --> 01:52:43.423
QUESTION OF HOW EVERYTHING FITS

01:52:43.490 --> 01:52:46.793
TOGETHER IT IS THIS IS JUST A

01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:49.295
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION HERE AND

01:52:49.362 --> 01:52:49.963
IT AND WHETHER WE ASK IT OR

01:52:50.029 --> 01:52:52.899
NOT. EVERY INDIVIDUAL PIECE OF

01:52:52.966 --> 01:52:55.368
THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S

01:52:55.435 --> 01:52:56.769
GOING TO BE AT THE HEART OF

01:52:56.836 --> 01:52:58.271
WHATEVER THE DISCUSSIONS ARE

01:52:58.338 --> 01:53:00.406
BECAUSE WELL WE SHARE GENERAL

01:53:00.473 --> 01:53:04.844
DIRECTIONS- THOSE ARE ISSUES IN

01:53:04.911 --> 01:53:06.379
FOR EXAMPLE LET ME ASK FINANCE

01:53:06.446 --> 01:53:08.081
FIRST. AND THIS JUST

01:53:08.148 --> 01:53:10.550
ILLUSTRATES A TRYING TO FIT IT

01:53:10.617 --> 01:53:13.386
TOGETHER. THE IF THE PARENTS

01:53:13.453 --> 01:53:14.754
WILL HAVE THE OPTION TO KEEP

01:53:14.821 --> 01:53:16.289
THEIR FOUR YEAR OLDS IN STATE

01:53:16.356 --> 01:53:18.091
PRESCHOOL HEAD START OR OTHER

01:53:18.158 --> 01:53:20.593
CHILD CARE. EVEN IF THEY ARE

01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:23.763
AGE ELIGIBLE FOR T. K. AND

01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:24.831
WHETHER THAT'S EITHER DURING

01:53:24.898 --> 01:53:27.400
THE TRANSITION AFTER HOW DOES

01:53:27.467 --> 01:53:30.436
THAT FIT TOGETHER. AND THERE

01:53:30.503 --> 01:53:31.337
ARE THIS IS JUST GO HOMES

01:53:31.404 --> 01:53:32.906
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I'M

01:53:32.972 --> 01:53:34.941
HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

01:53:35.008 --> 01:53:38.678
SO THE IDEA HERE WHERE WE'RE

01:53:38.745 --> 01:53:40.747
NOT PROPOSING TO ELIMINATE FOUR

01:53:40.813 --> 01:53:41.414
YEAR OLD ELIGIBILITY IN THE

01:53:41.481 --> 01:53:44.350
OTHER- EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS

01:53:44.417 --> 01:53:45.485
AND WE'RE NOT PROPOSING TO

01:53:45.552 --> 01:53:48.354
ELIMINATE FOR ELIGIBILITY- FOR

01:53:48.421 --> 01:53:50.256
ANY OF THAT THE SUBSIDIZED

01:53:50.323 --> 01:53:52.325
CHILD CARE PROGRAMS. ON HEAD

01:53:52.392 --> 01:53:55.161
START OR- STATE PRESCHOOL AND

01:53:55.228 --> 01:53:57.263
TO RETAIN PARENT CHOICE. I

01:53:57.330 --> 01:53:59.866
CAN'T SPEAK TO- YOU KNOW

01:53:59.933 --> 01:54:02.101
SEVERAL YEARS DOWN THE ROAD- I

01:54:02.168 --> 01:54:04.237
CAN'T SPEAK TO WEAR ON THE

01:54:04.304 --> 01:54:05.338
STATE MAY DECIDE TO GO WITH

01:54:05.405 --> 01:54:06.906
THOSE PROGRAMS BUT FOR THE

01:54:06.973 --> 01:54:09.175
FORESEEABLE FUTURE- WE ARE

01:54:09.242 --> 01:54:11.711
PLANNING ON- AT RETAINING THAT

01:54:11.778 --> 01:54:13.846
ELIGIBILITY I WILL SAY THAT FOR

01:54:13.913 --> 01:54:15.081
THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM IN

01:54:15.148 --> 01:54:18.184
PARTICULAR. WE ARE- WE ARE AT

01:54:18.251 --> 01:54:21.454
IT AND PROPOSING THAT IN THE

01:54:21.521 --> 01:54:22.655
TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE BUDGET-

01:54:22.722 --> 01:54:24.691
OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT

01:54:24.757 --> 01:54:27.594
WE WILL DEVELOP A PLAN. TO HELP

01:54:27.660 --> 01:54:28.895
PROVIDERS WHO ARE CURRENTLY

01:54:28.962 --> 01:54:31.631
PROVIDING SERVICES- THROUGH THE

01:54:31.698 --> 01:54:33.566
C. S. P. PROGRAM TO SERVE MORE

01:54:33.633 --> 01:54:34.534
YOUNGER CHILDREN WITH THE

01:54:34.601 --> 01:54:36.536
RECOGNITION THAT. WILL LIKELY

01:54:36.603 --> 01:54:37.770
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT

01:54:37.837 --> 01:54:38.838
RATES UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

01:54:38.905 --> 01:54:40.406
RATIOS FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN ARE

01:54:40.473 --> 01:54:42.742
MUCH DIFFERENT. THAN THEY ARE

01:54:42.809 --> 01:54:45.878
FOR YOUR CHILDREN SO THAT IS-

01:54:45.945 --> 01:54:46.512
PART OF AN ONGOING CONVERSATION

01:54:46.579 --> 01:54:48.781
AND- CERTAINLY YOU KNOW ALL OF

01:54:48.848 --> 01:54:50.316
ALL OF OUR PROPOSALS ARE IN

01:54:50.383 --> 01:54:51.784
ALIGNMENT WITH THE MASTER PLAN

01:54:51.851 --> 01:54:52.986
FOR EARLY LEARNING CARE SO IN

01:54:53.052 --> 01:54:54.587
TERMS OF. HOW THESE PIECES FIT

01:54:54.654 --> 01:54:55.989
TOGETHER ON THAT THERE

01:54:56.055 --> 01:54:57.257
CERTAINLY IS THAT A LOGIC IN A

01:54:57.323 --> 01:54:59.559
PLAN BEHIND IT- BUT FOR NOW

01:54:59.626 --> 01:55:01.861
THAT. WE ARE WE ARE WE ARE

01:55:01.928 --> 01:55:03.696
COMMITTED TO PARENT CHOICE AND

01:55:03.763 --> 01:55:09.068
RETAINING THE ELIGIBILITY.

01:55:09.135 --> 01:55:10.303
THOSE PROGRAMS FROM. THAT OF

01:55:10.370 --> 01:55:12.272
BILL. THAT IS WITH. IT IT LET

01:55:12.338 --> 01:55:14.374
ME. ASK ONE UP JUST ON THAT

01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:16.009
SPECIFIC POINT BECAUSE YOU SAID

01:55:16.075 --> 01:55:19.445
YOU CAN'T. BOB WHATEVER THE

01:55:19.512 --> 01:55:21.180
WORD WAS USED YOU CAN'T FORESEE

01:55:21.247 --> 01:55:23.049
INTO THE FUTURE AND NO WAY INTO

01:55:23.116 --> 01:55:24.884
THE FUTURE WHAT WILL HAPPEN

01:55:24.951 --> 01:55:28.321
BUT- BOB WHAT WE CAN IS IF

01:55:28.388 --> 01:55:30.890
THERE'S A TRANSITION. AND WE

01:55:30.957 --> 01:55:37.430
GET. OUR- YOU KNOW THE EARLY

01:55:37.497 --> 01:55:39.565
EDUCATION PROPOSAL UP. DOES

01:55:39.632 --> 01:55:40.800
THAT PRESUME THAT YOU'RE

01:55:40.867 --> 01:55:45.171
ALLOWING- PARENTAL CHOICE AFTER

01:55:45.238 --> 01:55:46.906
THE TRANSITION BECAUSE THAT IS

01:55:46.973 --> 01:55:48.941
PART OR SHOULD BE PART OF THE

01:55:49.008 --> 01:55:50.910
PLAN NOW A DESCRIPTION OF WHERE

01:55:50.977 --> 01:55:52.945
WHAT THAT IS SO WHAT WOULD

01:55:53.012 --> 01:55:54.447
HAPPEN IF THE PROGRAM GOES

01:55:54.514 --> 01:55:56.049
COMPLETELY UP WITH PARENTAL

01:55:56.115 --> 01:55:57.750
CHOICE ON THE OTHER PROGRAMS

01:55:57.817 --> 01:55:59.652
WOULD THAT CONTINUE. AFTER THE

01:55:59.719 --> 01:56:03.690
TRANSITION TO A FULLY BEING UP.

01:56:03.756 --> 01:56:05.325
SO OUR OUR CURRENT PROPOSAL

01:56:05.391 --> 01:56:07.593
ROUTINES RETAINS THE PARENTAL

01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:09.162
CHOICE- REGARDLESS OF WHERE

01:56:09.228 --> 01:56:10.630
WE'RE AT THE TIKI TRANSITION I

01:56:10.697 --> 01:56:12.899
WOULD JUST NOTE THAT- CURRENTLY

01:56:12.965 --> 01:56:15.735
SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN AT FIVE.

01:56:15.802 --> 01:56:17.570
UNDER FIVE YEARS OLD AND OLDER

01:56:17.637 --> 01:56:19.605
CAN ACCESS- ALL OF OUR

01:56:19.672 --> 01:56:21.574
SUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE PROGRAMS

01:56:21.641 --> 01:56:23.209
AND SO WE WOULD SEE FOUR YEAR

01:56:23.276 --> 01:56:27.213
OLDS- FOLLOWING THAT THAT SAME

01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:29.449
LOGIC. IN OUR ENERGY AS

01:56:29.515 --> 01:56:31.517
SUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE PROGRAMS-

01:56:31.584 --> 01:56:33.152
I THINK YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF

01:56:33.219 --> 01:56:34.654
NOT BEING ABLE TO PREDICT THE

01:56:34.721 --> 01:56:36.189
FUTURE CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THE

01:56:36.255 --> 01:56:37.090
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAY MAKE

01:56:37.156 --> 01:56:39.459
CHANGES IN HEAD START- THAT I

01:56:39.525 --> 01:56:42.895
CAN'T PREDICT- AND- IT MAY BE

01:56:42.962 --> 01:56:44.530
THAT- YOU KNOW THERE'S A

01:56:44.597 --> 01:56:46.866
PROPOSAL TO. INTEGRATE STATE

01:56:46.933 --> 01:56:48.368
PRESCHOOL WITH SOME OTHER CHILD

01:56:48.434 --> 01:56:50.436
CARE PROGRAMS- IN THE FUTURE

01:56:50.503 --> 01:56:52.472
THAT THAT THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:56:52.538 --> 01:56:54.307
CONSIDERS- I KNOW THAT THERE

01:56:54.374 --> 01:56:56.376
ARE SOME BILLS OUT THERE- THAT

01:56:56.442 --> 01:56:58.311
THAT LOOK AT SORT OF THE ZERO

01:56:58.378 --> 01:56:59.712
TO THREE POPULATION. I'M NOT

01:56:59.779 --> 01:57:00.279
QUITE SURE WHERE THOSE ARE

01:57:00.346 --> 01:57:01.547
GOING TO GO SO THAT'S WHAT I

01:57:01.614 --> 01:57:02.515
MEANT BY NOT BEING ABLE TO

01:57:02.582 --> 01:57:03.950
PREDICT THE FUTURE BUT THIS

01:57:04.016 --> 01:57:06.085
PROPOSAL ASSUMES. THAT FOUR

01:57:06.152 --> 01:57:07.954
YEAR OLD ELIGIBILITY FOR AT THE

01:57:08.020 --> 01:57:09.555
EXISTING CHILD CARE PROGRAMS

01:57:09.622 --> 01:57:11.891
WILL REMAIN INTACT- DURING THE

01:57:11.958 --> 01:57:13.826
TRANSITION AND AFTERWARDS AND I

01:57:13.893 --> 01:57:15.094
GET THAT WE CAN'T PREDICT WHAT

01:57:15.161 --> 01:57:16.596
OTHER ENTITIES ARE DOING OR

01:57:16.662 --> 01:57:18.264
EVEN THE STATE LEGISLATURE ON

01:57:18.331 --> 01:57:19.832
CERTAIN PIECES OF THIS GOING

01:57:19.899 --> 01:57:21.033
FORWARD BUT WE KNOW WHAT WE

01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:24.470
KNOW NOW. AND WITH YOUR PLAN

01:57:24.537 --> 01:57:27.373
BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW NOW. IT

01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:29.742
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE ABSENT ANY

01:57:29.809 --> 01:57:32.478
OTHER CHANGES IT IS YOUR PLAN

01:57:32.545 --> 01:57:34.080
TO CONTINUE PARENTAL CHOICE AND

01:57:34.147 --> 01:57:36.282
THESE OTHER PROGRAMS. IN

01:57:36.349 --> 01:57:38.050
CONJUNCTION WITH THE CASE THAT

01:57:38.117 --> 01:57:39.585
A CORRECT STATEMENT THAT IS A

01:57:39.652 --> 01:57:42.255
CORRECT STATEMENT YES OKAY. ARE

01:57:42.321 --> 01:57:43.890
THANK YOU AND IT BUT IT

01:57:43.956 --> 01:57:46.559
ACCENTUATES HOW THERE'S SO MANY

01:57:46.626 --> 01:57:49.529
DETAILS ABOUT THIS THAT THAT

01:57:49.595 --> 01:57:51.397
JUST PROPOSING IT IS NOT ENOUGH

01:57:51.464 --> 01:57:53.800
IT IS ROSY. SORT OF FLUSHING

01:57:53.866 --> 01:57:55.535
OUT THESE DETAILS SO THERE'S

01:57:55.601 --> 01:57:58.004
CLARITY FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED

01:57:58.070 --> 01:57:59.439
AND I KNOW THAT IT'S PHASED IN

01:57:59.505 --> 01:58:05.711
BY AGE GROUP- OVER NUMBER OF

01:58:05.778 --> 01:58:06.379
YEARS AND FINALLY THERE WERE BE

01:58:06.446 --> 01:58:08.114
AND IT. TO BORN BUT OCT TO.

01:58:08.181 --> 01:58:11.751
AND- IT IN THE SYSTEM BUT ARM.

01:58:11.818 --> 01:58:14.387
HE I THINK THAT THAT WERE

01:58:14.454 --> 01:58:15.688
REALLY GOING TO WANT TO DRIVE

01:58:15.755 --> 01:58:18.057
SOME OF THESE TO GROUND IT IF

01:58:18.124 --> 01:58:20.960
WE'RE GOING TO. APPROVE THIS

01:58:21.027 --> 01:58:22.228
AND I MEAN JUST ONE RANDOM

01:58:22.295 --> 01:58:25.765
QUESTION IS. FOR EXAMPLE. ON T.

01:58:25.832 --> 01:58:27.467
K. AS EACH ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

01:58:27.533 --> 01:58:29.569
REQUIRED TO OFFER T. K. UNDER

01:58:29.635 --> 01:58:32.572
THIS PLAN OR IS IT ONLY ONE

01:58:32.638 --> 01:58:36.275
SITE PER DISTRICT. SO THAT THE

01:58:36.342 --> 01:58:37.844
WE'RE NOT PROPOSING ANY CHANGES

01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:39.312
TO THE CURRENT CONSTRUCT OF

01:58:39.378 --> 01:58:40.613
TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN

01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:41.447
CURRENT REQUIREMENTS

01:58:41.514 --> 01:58:42.515
REQUIREMENTS UNDER TRANSITIONAL

01:58:42.582 --> 01:58:44.584
KINDERGARTEN SO THE CURRENT LAW

01:58:44.650 --> 01:58:46.853
REQUIRES THAT EVERY ALLEY A IS

01:58:46.919 --> 01:58:49.088
I'M REQUIRED TO GIVE ACCESS. TO

01:58:49.155 --> 01:58:52.625
ALL. FOUR YEAR OLDS TO T. K.

01:58:52.692 --> 01:58:54.460
YOU KNOW CURRENTLY I THINK IT

01:58:54.527 --> 01:58:55.862
LARGE PART BECAUSE OF THE SMALL

01:58:55.928 --> 01:58:56.963
NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT

01:58:57.029 --> 01:58:57.897
PARTICIPATE IN TRANSITIONAL

01:58:57.964 --> 01:58:59.799
KINDERGARTEN MANY ELEAZAR DO

01:58:59.866 --> 01:59:02.034
NOT PROVIDE ACCESS TO T. K.

01:59:02.101 --> 01:59:04.237
EVERY SITE HOWEVER GIVEN- THAT

01:59:04.303 --> 01:59:06.239
WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING

01:59:06.305 --> 01:59:08.641
ACCESS TO THAT PROGRAM- MUCH

01:59:08.708 --> 01:59:11.744
MORE LIKELY THAT- ALL. ALL LEDS

01:59:11.811 --> 01:59:14.013
WILL HAVE TO UTILIZE THE SPACE

01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:15.181
THAT AT ALL THEIR ELEMENTARY

01:59:15.248 --> 01:59:16.582
SCHOOLS ON TO SERVE THE

01:59:16.649 --> 01:59:18.351
STUDENTS SO- WE'RE NOT

01:59:18.417 --> 01:59:20.353
PROPOSING ANY CHANGES- TO THE

01:59:20.419 --> 01:59:22.722
CURRENT LAW- HOWEVER GIVEN THE

01:59:22.788 --> 01:59:23.756
INCREASE IN MAGNITUDE OF

01:59:23.823 --> 01:59:24.524
STUDENTS BEING SERVED IT'S

01:59:24.590 --> 01:59:25.892
LIKELY THAT WHAT WHAT IT LOOKS

01:59:25.958 --> 01:59:27.226
LIKE CURRENTLY WILL NOT BE WHAT

01:59:27.293 --> 01:59:28.461
IT LOOKS LIKE. ON A FEW YEARS

01:59:28.528 --> 01:59:29.729
AND THEN THAT RAISES THE

01:59:29.795 --> 01:59:31.264
QUESTION THAT IF BEFORE

01:59:31.330 --> 01:59:34.166
TRANSITIONING OVER A FEW YEARS

01:59:34.233 --> 01:59:37.103
AND WE HAVE LOW STUDENTS TO

01:59:37.169 --> 01:59:41.040
ADULT RATIOS. OF INDIE NT K.

01:59:41.107 --> 01:59:46.078
TEACHERS HAVE EARLY CHILDHOOD.

01:59:46.145 --> 01:59:47.613
EDUCATION EXPERIENCE. HOW DO WE-

01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:48.214
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE- WITH

01:59:48.281 --> 01:59:50.349
THOSE REQUIREMENTS TO HAVE THE

01:59:50.416 --> 01:59:53.386
PEOPLE AND- THE EDUCATION DONE

01:59:53.452 --> 01:59:55.421
IN TIME TO STAND THIS UP THE

01:59:55.488 --> 01:59:57.757
WAY IT IS PROJECTED IN THIS

01:59:57.823 --> 02:00:01.627
TIME. FOR THAT'S A GREAT

02:00:01.694 --> 02:00:03.930
QUESTION AND YOU KNOW EAT. IN

02:00:03.996 --> 02:00:05.698
TERMS OF LOOKING AT ALL OF OUR

02:00:05.765 --> 02:00:07.567
PROPOSALS REGARDING A TEACHER

02:00:33.726 --> 02:00:36.429
OUT AND THAT IT WOULD JUST

02:00:36.495 --> 02:00:37.597
WOULD NOTE THAT THE ADDITIONAL

02:00:37.663 --> 02:00:39.098
STAFF PERSON THAT NEEDS TO BE

02:00:39.165 --> 02:00:40.232
IN THE CLASSROOM CAN BE

BILL WORKFORCE I'M FOR THAT

02:00:57.350 --> 02:01:02.955
POSITION. KARAMANA ARE I THINK

02:01:03.022 --> 02:01:03.956
IT'S AN EXAM. THAT IT'S TO BE A

02:01:04.023 --> 02:01:07.393
CHIU- ME WHY ARE I COULD GO ON

02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:08.027

I I'VE TO WHERE I'VE- TO GO

02:01:09.395 --> 02:01:10.596
WHICH IS. HELLO BIT OF.

02:01:10.663 --> 02:01:11.697
SIGNALING TO THAT THERE'S

02:01:11.764 --> 02:01:12.565
CONCERN ABOUT THE THIS RELATES

02:01:12.632 --> 02:01:13.966
TO THE OTHER. THAT THERE'S GOOD

02:01:14.033 --> 02:01:15.201
THAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A

02:01:15.267 --> 02:01:17.436
LOT OF DETAIL THAT SOME OF THE

02:01:17.503 --> 02:01:18.971
IMPEDIMENTS ARE GOING TO HAVE

02:01:19.038 --> 02:01:20.439
TO BE ADDRESSED TO MAKE SURE

02:01:20.506 --> 02:01:21.607
THAT WE COULD DO THIS AND HAVE

02:01:21.674 --> 02:01:23.275
SOME CHECK AND TO KNOW HOW WE

02:01:23.342 --> 02:01:26.245
ARE DOING. OUR AT THOSE

02:01:26.312 --> 02:01:29.749
DIFFERENT TIMES AND- IT IT JUST

02:01:29.815 --> 02:01:32.151
IS A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION ABOUT

02:01:32.218 --> 02:01:33.919
THE INTEGRATION- BECAUSE THAT

02:01:33.986 --> 02:01:36.355
THAT MAYBE ONE. OR LAST FOLLOW

02:01:36.422 --> 02:01:39.191
UP TO MISS HOLMES. IF WE

02:01:39.258 --> 02:01:41.761
OFFERED THE PARENTAL CHOICE AND

02:01:41.827 --> 02:01:44.130
CONTINUE ALL THESE ARE

02:01:44.196 --> 02:01:46.866
DIFFERENT OPTIONS. DO YOU HAVE

02:01:46.932 --> 02:01:49.135
ANY PRESUMPTION AS PART OF YOUR

02:01:49.201 --> 02:01:50.703
PROPOSAL ABOUT HOW MANY WOULD

02:01:50.770 --> 02:01:52.438
BE ANTI K. AS OPPOSED TO THE

02:01:52.505 --> 02:01:55.608
OTHER PROGRAMS I MEAN WHAT THE

02:01:55.675 --> 02:01:57.877
PERCENTAGE OF THE SECTORS ARE.

02:01:57.943 --> 02:02:00.246
IN WHO WOULD BE WHERE.

02:02:00.312 --> 02:02:03.015
CERTAINLY SO I CAN SHARE- OFF

02:02:03.082 --> 02:02:04.116
THE TOP OF MY HEAD I CAN SHARE

02:02:04.183 --> 02:02:07.853
OUR- ESTIMATES FOR AND HOW MANY

02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:08.854
FOUR YEAR OLDS WOULD MOVE OVER

02:02:08.921 --> 02:02:10.389
TO TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN.

02:02:10.456 --> 02:02:12.291
OF WHAT I CAN'T PROVIDE WITH

02:02:12.358 --> 02:02:13.626
ANY LEVEL OF ACCURACY OR

02:02:13.693 --> 02:02:15.895
PRECISION IS ON HOW MANY MIGHT

02:02:15.961 --> 02:02:17.797
BE RETAINED I'M IN THE OTHR

02:02:17.863 --> 02:02:20.132
PROGRAMS- BECAUSE WE DON'T WE

02:02:20.199 --> 02:02:21.300
DON'T HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF HOW

02:02:21.367 --> 02:02:23.569
MANY STUDENTS- WILL WANT TO

02:02:23.636 --> 02:02:25.604
STAY- IN THE CHILD CARE

02:02:25.671 --> 02:02:27.039
PROGRAMS THAT SUBSIDIZE CHILD

02:02:27.106 --> 02:02:28.174
CARE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE-

02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:30.576
OUTSIDE OF T. K. BUT WE ARE. WE

02:02:30.643 --> 02:02:32.912
ARE ATICIPATING THAT-

02:02:32.978 --> 02:02:35.581
APPROXIMATELY APPROXIMATELY TWO

02:02:35.648 --> 02:02:36.782
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FOUR

02:02:36.849 --> 02:02:38.584
YEAR OLDS- WHAT WILL BE COMING

02:02:38.651 --> 02:02:40.453
INTO THE T. K. SYSTEM UPON FULL

02:02:40.519 --> 02:02:42.621
IMPLEMENTATION- THAT MAY TAKE A

02:02:42.688 --> 02:02:46.358
FEW YEARS TO- TO. MATERIALIZE

02:02:46.425 --> 02:02:48.360
IF YOU LOOK AT THE ROLL OUT OF

02:02:48.427 --> 02:02:52.231
T. K. WHEN IT WAS FIRST- COMING

02:02:52.298 --> 02:02:53.265
INTO BEING- ABOUT TEN YEARS

02:02:53.332 --> 02:02:56.035
AGO- WE SLOWLY KIND OF

02:02:56.102 --> 02:02:59.638
INCREASED- THAT. THAT AT. THE

02:02:59.705 --> 02:03:00.106
FOUR YEAR OLD WHO ARE

02:03:00.172 --> 02:03:01.741
PARTICIPATING I'M AS MORE

02:03:01.807 --> 02:03:03.142
PARENTS BECAME AWARE OF ITS

02:03:03.209 --> 02:03:03.776
EXISTENCE AND OUR CHILD

02:03:03.843 --> 02:03:06.212
ELIGIBILITY- SO THAT TOOK A

02:03:06.278 --> 02:03:07.213
LITTLE BIT OF TIME BUT ACTUAL

02:03:07.279 --> 02:03:08.447
IMPLEMENTATION WERE

02:03:08.514 --> 02:03:09.348
DISTRIBUTING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED

02:03:09.415 --> 02:03:11.083
AND FIFTY THOUSAND. ADDITIONAL

02:03:11.150 --> 02:03:12.184
STUDENTS AND PART OF TE REASON

02:03:12.251 --> 02:03:13.853
WHY I CAN'T GET A GREAT AT

02:03:13.919 --> 02:03:15.488
NUMBER ON THE OTHER PROGRAMS

02:03:15.554 --> 02:03:16.589
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH HOW MANY KIDS

02:03:16.655 --> 02:03:18.591
WE ARE. ANTICIPATING WILL STAY

02:03:18.657 --> 02:03:20.025
IN THOSE PROGRAMS IS BECAUSE

02:03:20.092 --> 02:03:22.261
TKA HAS OPEN ELIGIBILITY FOR

02:03:22.328 --> 02:03:23.963
ANY STUDENT AND THOSE PROGRAMS

02:03:24.029 --> 02:03:25.097
ARE MEANS TESTED SO THEY DO

02:03:25.164 --> 02:03:26.265
HAPPEN INCOME ELIGIBILITY

02:03:26.332 --> 02:03:28.367
REQUIREMENTS. SO IT'S HARD TO

02:03:28.434 --> 02:03:29.702
MEASURE THE IMPACT THE

02:03:29.769 --> 02:03:30.970
DIFFERENCE AN IMPACT ON

02:03:31.036 --> 02:03:33.305
FAMILIES WHO QUALIFY FOR THE

02:03:33.372 --> 02:03:35.074
CHILD CARE PROGRAMS VERSUS. I'M

02:03:35.141 --> 02:03:36.575
LOOKING AT YOU KNOW THE TOTAL

02:03:36.642 --> 02:03:39.578
AN INFLUX OF KIDS FROM ALL

02:03:39.645 --> 02:03:43.182
INCOME LEVELS. OKAY I JUST

02:03:43.249 --> 02:03:46.519
THINK THAT SIGNALS- A LOT OF

02:03:46.585 --> 02:03:48.154
DISCUSSIONS WERE GOING TO HAVE

02:03:48.220 --> 02:03:49.221
TO HAPPEN THE NEXT COUPLE OF

02:03:49.288 --> 02:03:51.590
WEEKS QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE

02:03:51.657 --> 02:03:59.865
MEMBERS. SENATOR MAN. FOR

02:03:59.932 --> 02:04:01.233

FINANCE- FROM ITS FIRST

02:04:02.768 --> 02:04:05.538
CLASSROOM SPACE- THIS THIS YOUR

02:04:05.604 --> 02:04:07.473
BUDGET CONTEMPLATES JUST THE

02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:10.042
NEED TO ACQUIRE OR BUILD OUT

02:04:10.109 --> 02:04:13.813
MORE PHYSICALS INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:04:13.879 --> 02:04:15.214
CERTAINLY YES THE DESK HOMES

02:04:15.281 --> 02:04:17.082
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE

02:04:17.149 --> 02:04:19.018
PER WE INCLUDED TWO HUNDRED

02:04:19.084 --> 02:04:20.786
MILLION- FOR TRANSITIONAL

02:04:20.853 --> 02:04:22.855
KINDERGARTEN FACILITIES- IN THE

02:04:22.922 --> 02:04:24.190
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REDUCE THAT

02:04:24.256 --> 02:04:25.791
BY ABOUT TEN MILLION TO COVER

02:04:25.858 --> 02:04:27.026
THE COST OF PRESCHOOL LEARNING

02:04:27.092 --> 02:04:29.528
FOUNDATION UPDATES YEAH- BUT WE

02:04:29.595 --> 02:04:30.462
HAVE A HUNDRED NINETY MILLION

02:04:30.529 --> 02:04:33.098
FOR- TKA FACILITIES AND THEN

THAT I APPRECIATE THAT- AND

02:04:37.203 --> 02:04:39.071
THEN I GUESS I THINK I HAVE A

02:04:39.138 --> 02:04:42.741
QUESTION FOR- WAS IT IS NOBLE

02:04:42.808 --> 02:04:44.310
MORGAN I THINK YOU'VE

02:04:44.376 --> 02:04:46.979
REFERENCED- SOME OF THE STUDIES

02:04:47.046 --> 02:04:48.814
AROUND T. K. AND I'M SURE THOSE

02:04:48.881 --> 02:04:50.950
ARE ARE RIGHT WE KNOW EARLY

CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IS SUPER

02:04:51.584 --> 02:04:54.286
IMPORTANT- CENTER LEARN KIND

02:04:54.353 --> 02:04:55.788
OF. ALLUDED TO THE THERE

02:04:55.855 --> 02:04:57.756
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A TRADE

02:04:57.823 --> 02:04:59.124
OFF HERE BETWEEN. HIGHER

02:04:59.191 --> 02:05:00.960
QUALITY EDUCATION VISITED

02:05:01.026 --> 02:05:03.128
SHOPPED HERE RIGHT AND I GUESS.

02:05:03.195 --> 02:05:04.463
THE QUESTION IN A MOVIE ST THE

02:05:04.530 --> 02:05:06.799
RADICAL BUT- YOU KNOW IF WE

02:05:06.866 --> 02:05:09.668
WERE TO PRIORITIZE UNIVERSAL T.

02:05:09.735 --> 02:05:14.073
K. R. FOR UNIVERSAL CHILD CARE.

02:05:14.139 --> 02:05:16.408
WHICH OF THOSE WILL HAVE LIKE

02:05:16.475 --> 02:05:18.510
BETTER PEDAGOGICAL AL COMES

02:05:18.577 --> 02:05:24.717
DOWN THE LINE IS TO SAY. OR IS

02:05:24.783 --> 02:05:25.551
IT MORE IMPORTANT TO JUST HAVE

02:05:25.618 --> 02:05:28.954
PEOPLE WATCHING YOU IN SORT OF-

02:05:29.021 --> 02:05:32.524
REGULATED SAY SPACES WHAT WHAT

02:05:32.591 --> 02:05:33.826
WHAT IS IT WHAT IS A RESEARCHER

02:05:33.893 --> 02:05:35.861
ON THIS AS WE'RE THINKING ABOUT

02:05:35.928 --> 02:05:38.330
HOW TO PROCEED. SO WHEN I DON'T

02:05:38.397 --> 02:05:39.999
WANT TO DO IS GET INTERIOR FOR

02:05:40.065 --> 02:05:41.734
THE WARS THAT HAPPENED BETWEEN

02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:44.169
ACCESSING QUALITY. BUT WHAT I

02:05:44.236 --> 02:05:45.137
CAN DO IS SPEAK TO SOME OF THE

02:05:45.204 --> 02:05:47.940
RESEARCH FAMILIES NEED BOTH

02:05:48.007 --> 02:05:49.074
THEY NEED THEIR CHILDREN. TO

02:05:49.141 --> 02:05:51.543
WATCH WHILE THEY'RE AT WORK BUT

02:05:51.610 --> 02:05:53.379
THOSE WORK THOSE SETTINGS. NEED

02:05:53.445 --> 02:05:55.281
TO BE HIGH QUALITY AND

02:05:55.347 --> 02:05:56.448
REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY ARE

02:05:56.515 --> 02:05:58.684
HOME BASED SCHOOL BASED. AND

02:05:58.751 --> 02:06:01.320
PRICE TAG. IN THE COMMUNITY WE

02:06:01.387 --> 02:06:02.388
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

02:06:02.454 --> 02:06:03.889
TEACHERS HAVE THE

02:06:03.956 --> 02:06:05.925
QUALIFICATIONS. REPORT THE

02:06:05.991 --> 02:06:08.661
RESOURCES. WE CAN ENGAGE IN

02:06:08.727 --> 02:06:09.962
RESPONSIVE INTERACTIONS.

02:06:10.029 --> 02:06:11.363
ESPECIALLY AS CHILDREN GROW

02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:12.364
OLDER THAT THEY REALLY USE

02:06:12.431 --> 02:06:14.533
CURRICULUM THAT IS INFORMED BY

02:06:14.600 --> 02:06:17.169
THE CHILDREN'S DEVELOPMENT. AND

02:06:17.236 --> 02:06:19.038
THAT IT'S AN ONGOING ASSESSMENT

02:06:19.104 --> 02:06:21.473
PIECE. SO WORKING IN THIS FIELD

02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:23.642
YOU REALLY DO NEED RESOURCES

02:06:23.709 --> 02:06:26.211
SUPPORTS EDUCATION. AND

02:06:26.278 --> 02:06:28.213
RESEARCH CLEARLY SHOWS HOW MUCH

02:06:28.280 --> 02:06:29.348
THAT IS HE SAYS MATTER

02:06:29.415 --> 02:06:31.550
ESPECIALLY MOST OF ITS TARGET

02:06:31.617 --> 02:06:33.285
PRESCHOOL RESEARCH WITH THE

02:06:33.352 --> 02:06:34.853
BOSTON PUBLIC SCHOOL WHEN JUST

COMING OUT. THIS WEEK ORLAST

02:06:37.122 --> 02:06:39.124
WEEK WITH VERY STRONG OUTCOMES

02:06:39.191 --> 02:06:40.592
THEY HAVE BEEN VERY INTENTIONAL

02:06:40.659 --> 02:06:41.794
PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. THAT

02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:45.431
ACTUALLY STARTS WITH G. I THINK

02:06:45.497 --> 02:06:46.498
IT'S A FOR YOU ALSO MIGHT BE

02:06:46.565 --> 02:06:47.466
THE THRILLS BUT ALSO GOES

02:06:47.533 --> 02:06:48.500
THROUGH KINDERGARTEN FIRST

02:06:48.567 --> 02:06:49.969
GRADE. SO THAT THEY HAVE

02:06:50.035 --> 02:06:51.270
ALIGNMENT IN CURRICULUM AND

02:06:51.337 --> 02:06:53.272
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT.

02:06:53.339 --> 02:06:54.606
THERE'S ALSO SOME RESEARCH TO

02:06:54.673 --> 02:06:56.108
SHOW THAT TEACHER COMPENSATION.

02:06:56.175 --> 02:06:57.676
AND HOW YOU SUPPORT THE

02:06:57.743 --> 02:06:59.745
EDUCATORS CAN PASS BOTH IN

02:06:59.812 --> 02:07:02.581
RETENTION AS WELL AS- BEING

02:07:02.648 --> 02:07:03.649
ABLE TO GET THE TEACHERS WITH

02:07:03.716 --> 02:07:05.551
THOSE LEVELS OF EDUCATION THAT

02:07:05.617 --> 02:07:07.820
YOU MIGHT NEED. I APPRECIATE

02:07:07.886 --> 02:07:09.421
THAT I GUESS I JUST. WOULD FALL

02:07:09.488 --> 02:07:16.295
ON CENTER LAYERS COMMONSENSE.

02:07:16.362 --> 02:07:16.895
OBVIOUSLY WE ALL WANT. TEEKAY

AT THIS TIME. YOU KNOW IT A LOT

02:07:21.734 --> 02:07:23.335
OF FAMILIES THERE WHERE THREE
