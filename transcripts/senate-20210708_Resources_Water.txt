AND THERE'S NO ONE SHOWING UP AT THIS TIME. OKAY THANK YOU WILL BRING IT BACK TO DYESS. EARLIER ON A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR AND THE FIRST ONE IS THE ANALYSIS OF MAKE SOME SUGGESTIONS EVEN OFFERS AN ALTERNATIVE- ON PAGE SIX AND SEVEN AND I WONDERED IF YOU JUST WANTED TO RESPOND TO THAT. YOU KNOW IF IT'S OKAY I WILL HAVE OUR EXPERT I RESPOND TO THAT IF THAT'S- THAT'S APPROPRIATE JUST COULD YOU PROBABLY GET A BETTER RESPONSE FROM FROM HER THAN YOU WILL FROM- FROM ME. NO ARE ARE. NOT INCLINED TO TORTURE YOU. NO NO NO IT'S TOTALLY. IT TOTALLY FINE OKAY. BUT I WOULD SAY. THAT THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE AUTHOR ACCEPTED ADDRESS- THE SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED IN THE ALTERNATIVES- THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD ADD ON TO MAYBE HAVE THE. THE SPONSOR TALK ABOUT WHAT- WHAT. THEY TOOK AS AN AMENDMENTS AND WHAT THEY DIDN'T TAKE AND WHY THEY DIDN'T TAKE. MAYBE THAT BE A GOOD WAY TO PHRASE THE QUESTION TO THE QUICKER WE GET SOME- JUST ALL THE YEAH I MISSED ALL THE DO YOU WANT TO YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT I KNOW WE WORK WE WORK HARD THROUGH THESE AMENDMENTS AND- BELIEVE YOU ALL. ACCEPTED EVERYTHING WE ASK FOR. YES AND THANK YOU S. CENTER LATER YES WE A WE DID ACCEPT ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS AS REQUESTED- FROM- FROM CENTERS OFFICE AND FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION. THAT WE WORK WITH THEM VERY CLOSELY. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD ADDRESSED ALL THEIR CONCERNS. BUT COULD YOU BRIEFLY CHARACTERIZE WHAT THE CONCERNS WERE AND HOW YOU DRESSED AND I'M NOT LOOKING FOR CHAPTER AND VERSE ON LOOKING FOR MORE GLOBAL HEAR THEIR CONCERNS HERE'S HOW WE ADDRESS THEM. IT COULD BE AT EIGHTY FOUR FOUR TWO ORIGINALLY AND WHAT IS WHAT IS BASED ON THE- WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO FOLLOW THE CACHE CREEK PLANNED- BUT IT DIDN'T REALLY AND IT DIDN'T REALLY ENCOMPASS. ALL OF THE SMARA. AND THE WAY THAT IT WAS WRITTEN IT DIDN'T ACTUALLY REFER BACK TO ALL OF SMARA SO AND SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE REGRET THE LANGUAGE TO MAKE IT TODAY BUT WE WERE SUBJECT TO. ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS AS FAR AND THAT'S ALSO WE JUST MADE IT MORE CLEAR IN THE- IN THE LEGISLATION. CARRINGTON OTHER QUESTION. AND THAT IS THAT. BY DOING THIS- SORT OF. HAVING A SINGLE MASTER RECLAMATION PLANT. AND A COVER SIX COUNTIES SOME OF WHICH ARE REPRESENTED BY. PEOPLE ON OF THE DIETS HERE. DOES THAT MAKE IT HARDER FOR PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IF YOU ARE. SOMEBODY THAT'S BY JOSHUA TREE AND THERE'S SOMETHING OUT THERE. THAT IS AN ISSUE AND THE HEARING IS HELD IN DOWNTOWN LA OR SOMETHING DOES THAT MEAN THAT. THAT YOU ONLY HAVE A WAY TO ACCESS THIS PROCESS. IN ONE LOCATION EVEN THOUGH YOU MGHT BE IN ONE OF THE FAR FLUNG PLACES OF ONE OF THE SIX COUNTIES IT'S COVERED BY THIS POINT. ASSEMBLY THE RECLAMATION PLANS OUR OFFICE ALSO COVERED BY THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT WHICH DOES PROVIDE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION- AND IT IN A PUBLIC FORUM SO. THE PUBLIC WOULD BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE RECLAMATION PLANT THEMSELVES- I GET THE INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS TO VOTE I'M ASKING IF THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. MIGHT BE VERY REMOTE TO WHERE THE PERSON LIVES THAT'S WHAT MY QUESTION IS. IN TERMS OF AS THE- THAT STATE IT IS THE PERSON WHO IS THE GROUP THAT WOULD BE APPROVING THAT THE RECLAMATION PLANT SO IT WOULD BE AT THE STATE PROCESS. LEVEL ASIDE FROM CIGNA. WELL MY QUESTION IS STILL IF YOU'RE IN A FAR FLUNG LOCATION IN RELATION TO THE SMART PLANT ARE THEY GOING TO HAVE READY ACCESS IF THERE'S A REQUIREMENT FOR IN PERSON PARTICIPATION THAT'S JUST WHAT I'M DRIVING AT BECAUSE YOU SEE IF WE WEREN'T DOING THIS PLAN. THE THEY WOULD BE INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS AND I KNOW WE'RE DOING THIS TO STREAMLINE IT SO THERE'S NOT INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS. BUT RELIGIOUS SAY THERE WAS A PROJECT ON THE COLORADO RIVER. AND TO THE ONLY IN PERSON PUBLIC PARTICIPATION BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE A REGIONAL PLAN IS TO HAVE THEM GO TO LOS ANGELES I AM JUST TRYING TO. TO GET SOME ASSURANCE THAT WE ARE NOT SCREENING PEOPLE AWAY FROM PUBLIC PARTICIPATION BY ADOPTING THIS BILL SO I. CAN COMMENT SINCE THESE ARE AMENDMENTS- THE INTENT HERE BY. BRINGING ALL THIS BACK IN THIS MARA WAS THAT THE RECLAMATION PLAN PROCESS ITSELF WILL HAVE WILL BE PUBLICLY NOTICED AND THAT THERE WILL BE AT THE TO THE EXTENT IT AS MULTI COUNTY IMPACT IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE THAT THEN ON A PROJECT BY PROJECT BASIS AFTERWARDS. IT'S NOT AS IF YOU CAN JUST- SORT OF CATCH ALL WITH A BIG PROGRAMMATIC HE I ARE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO THEN TEAR OFF OF THAT PLAN I THINK THEY WERE I THINK THERE ARE SOME BORROWING PITS AND OTHER THINGS OUT. IN THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AREA BUT SAY SOMETHING WERE GOING ON AND THERE IS A RECLAMATION PROJECT IN VENTURA COUNTY UNDER THAT PLAN I THINK THAT WOULD. AND THAT SPONSOR CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT THAT WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE. SEPARATELY NOTICED UNDERSEA CLUB THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT SO YOUR TUNER D. OF A HEARING IN VENTURA COUNTY SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO GO AND SOME RIGHT. AT THE MINISTERS OF THAT'S TRUE THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION JEFF I CAN'T INTO AND SENATOR I THINK WE HAVE- ROSIE THOMAS AYE WITH METROPOLITAN START THINKING ANSWER SOMEBODY'S QUESTION KIND. OF THING I GOT THAT DESCRIPTION RIGHT BUT THE PROJECTS THEN CEO EITHER HOW YOU GO THROUGH THAT LOCAL IT WOULD HAVE TO BE NOTICED TO THE EXTENT THEY HAVE IMPACT LOCALLY THAT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THEIR OWN SEQUEL PROCESS WITH. MATT IS THE LEAD. AGENCY AS WELL AS THE PLAN. THAT THAT'S CORRECT. YEAH THE I DON'T WANT BE LABOR BUT OKAY SOME. YOU YOU YOU YOU USUALLY ARE FOR EXAMPLE IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY THERE'S ONE PARTICULAR OPEN PIT MINE THAT WAS VERY CONTROVERSIAL AND THE PLAN WAS JUST FOR THAT MINE AND EVERYTHING WAS NOTICED IN ALL THE PUBLIC ACCESS WAS RIGHT NEAR THAT MINE A. N. I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT IN THE INTEREST OF STREAMLINING MOVING PEOPLE OUT OF THE PROCESS BUT- I GOT A YES. ITSELF THAT YES WAS THE YES WE'RE SATISFIED AND WE CAN GET OUT OF MY WEEDS AND GO BACK TO OF THE CONSIDERATION OF THE BILL ON COULD TYPE APPRECIATE THE DILIGENCE AND- YOU KNOW. AFFECTED YEAH CENTER ALLEN MYSELF FROM ONE REGION ALL THE WAY OUT TO. THE ASSEMBLY OR MAYES IS AREA MATT IS A HUGE SPRAWLING ENTITY SERVING MANY CUSTOMERS SO I DON'T THINK. I DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN THIS LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS MEN TO SKIRT PUBLIC COMMENTER PROCESS ON INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS UNDER THIS PLAN IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA SO- IF THERE'S ANY NEED TO CLARIFY THAT WE CAN LOOK AT IT BUT- I. THINK WE'RE IN PRETTY GOOD GROUND HERE- BUT ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS- FROM MEMBERS QUESTIONS ANYTHING- I'D ENTERTAIN A MOTION IF APPROPRIATE WE HAVE TO WE DON'T OF A QUORUM. I CANNOT ENTERTAIN A MOTION I WOULD- BUT I WOULD ALLOW THE AUTHOR TO.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE FRUITFUL CONVERSATIONS WITH MY OFFICE AND STAKEHOLDERS. WE ARE HAPPY TO TAKE THE AMENDMENTS AND BELIEVE THAT THEY BRING THIS BILL TO A MUCH BETTER PLACE. AB FIVE FIVE NINE WILL BRING AND ADD NEW UNDER REPRESENTED VOICES TO THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER CONSERVANCY BOARD. IT REFRAMES THE FOCUS OF THE COUNTY RESIDENTS SEATS AND MAKES OTHER CHANGES TO ALIGN ITS OPERATIONS AS A STATE AGENCY ALONGSIDE OTHER CONSERVANCY'S. PUBLIC PARKS IN AND AROUND PUBLIC. URBAN AREAS ARE CRUCIAL FOR BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE. THE PANDEMIC HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE NEED FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO THE SPACES. AS WELL AS THE SEVERE LACK OF ACCESS MANY OF OUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAVE. RESIDENTS IN UNDERSERVED NEIGHBORHOODS IN BOTH FRESNO AND MADERA COUNTIES FACE JUST SUCH A PREDICAMENT. THANKFULLY THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER CONSERVANCY'S MISSION TO ACQUIRE LANDS ALONG THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER CONSERVE VALUABLE HABITAT AND DEVELOP THESE LANDS FOR THE PUBLIC BENEFIT IS A CURATOR THIS LACK OF ACCESS. HOWEVER TO PROVIDE THE MAXIMUM BENEFITS TO ALL IT IS IMPORTANT THAT DIVERSE AND MARGINALIZED VOICES AND PERSPECTIVES HELP GUIDE THE DECISIONS OF THE CONSERVANCY IN AN EQUITABLE MANNER. AB FIVE FIVE NINE EXPANDS THE CONSERVANCY BOARD TO INCLUDE THOSE NEW VOICES TO REPRESENT BOTH THE BROAD GEOGRAPHIC AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY THAT THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER PARKWAY SERVICE. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE AND I'M JOINED TODAY BY MAYOR SANTOS GARCIA OF THE CITY OF MADERA AND SHARON WEAVER THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER. PARKWAY CONSERVATION CONTRAST. VERY GOOD THANK YOU SUMMER LET'S TURN TO- YOUR LEAD SUPPORT AND I HAVE MISS WEAVER FIRST OR MR GARCIA MAYOR GARCIA- IS OF THE LIGHTS. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS- MY NAME IS SOME CLOSELY GARCIA AND I AM THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF MADERA AND A MEMBER OF THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER CONSERVANCY SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND I FULLY SUPPORT DR RAMBLE THE BILL AB FIVE FIVE NINE IN ITS PRESENT FORM. NOW I WAS VERY SURPRISED WHEN I WAS FIRST APPOINTED TO THE BOARD. BOB THIS IS A CALIFORNIA STATE BOARD THAT I WAS THE ONLY LATINO. ON THE BOARD. AND I STILL AM THE ONLY LET YOU KNOW ON THE BOARD. THERE ARE ADDITIONALLY THERE ARE NO AFRICAN AMERICANS ON THE BOARD. THERE ARE NO MONGOL REPRESENTATIVES ON THE BOARD THERE ARE NO PUNJAB THE REPRESENTATIVES ON THE BOARD. THIS LACK OF DIVERSITY ON THE BOARD NEEDS TO THE LACK OF ACCESS TO THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND PEOPLE IN THE OUTLYING AREAS AS THE REGION. SAN JOAQUIN RIVER RIVERVIEW DR ACCESS ROAD IS BLOCKED AND IT BARS THOSE WHO COULD MOST BENEFIT FROM THE KEEP GREEN SPACES ON THE RIVER BOTTOM. FOUR YEARS THE BOARD HAS VOTED TO DENY SCHOOL BUSES OR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION FROM ENTERING THE GATES AND GOING TO THE RIVER BOTTOM TO ENJOY THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER. I BELIEVE THAT INCREASING THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS ON THE BOARD WOULD LEAD TO CREATING SPACES FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR AND MORE DIVERSITY ON THE BOARD. AND SO THEREFORE I PLEASE ASK YOU TO PASS AB FIVE FIVE NINE. THANK YOU MAYOR GARCIA. MISS WEAVER. ONE MOMENT PLEASE MISS WEAVER'S LINE WAS HAVING SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES WERE TRYING TO RESET THAT FOR HER SHE PLACES ON USER COLD ONE MOMENT. GIVE IT A QUICK MOMENT HERE.

THANK YOU SO MUCH- SHARON WEAVER WITH THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER PARKWAY AND CONSERVATION TRUST AND I JUST WANNA THANK- ASSEMBLY MEMBER DR JOAQUIN ARAMBULA FOR ALTERING THIS IMPORTANT BILL WE THINK THESE ARE MUCH NEEDED CHANGES TO THE CONSERVANCY BOARD- WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE ADDITION OF NEW MEMBERS THE CHANGES AND TO ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR A. RIVER BOTTOM LANDOWNER MEMBER WHICH IS ST OSITION THAT IT'S BECOME HARDER AND HARDER TO FILL. OVER THE YEARS AT THE CONSERVANCY HAS ACQUIRED MORE LAND ALONG THE RIVER. AND WE'RE ALSO EXCITED ABOUT THE CHANGES TO THE CHAIRMANSHIP AND HOW IT ROTATES ON. THE VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE CONSERVANCY BOARD WE THINK ALL OF THESE CHANGES ARE WELL OVERDUE AND MUCH NEEDED. AND AGAIN WE OFFER OUR FULL SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL AND THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING IT TODAY.% OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M- MANY ARE THE LEADING WITNESSES AND- OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE ROOM SEEING ON HERE OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE ROOM NONE I COULD GO TO LINES.

MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS POLICY OWNER ON BEHALF OF THE MADERA AND FRESNO COUNTY SUPERVISORS BOARD OF SUPERVISORS STILL OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. NO ONE ELSE WE QUEUED UP AT THIS TIME MISTER CHAIR OKAY VERY GOOD WILL BRING IT BACK TO DYESS- CENTER LAYER THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR- LET ME COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL THIS. IS YOU CAN TELL FROM THE ANALYSIS I SERVED ON THIS CONSERVANCY BOARD FOR EIGHT YEARS AND THERE BEEN SOME CONTENTIOUS ISSUES AND SOME ISSUES ABOUT REPRESENTATION WHICH YOU ARE ADDRESSING WITH THIS BILL. IN THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN ONE KEY THING ABOUT GOVERNMENTS FOR CONSERVANCY SWITCHES. FROM THE STATE SIDE TO TRY TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE MORE MEMBER. APPOINTED BY STATE OFFICIALS THAT LOCAL AS IT'S A STATE AGENCY AT THIS BILL HONOR STATUS WITHIN THE EXPANSION SO IT'S GOOD THE ONE QUESTION I HAD IS A TRIBAL REPRESENTATIVE HE SAID BY THIS BILL THAT IS A GOOD THING AND- AS I UNDERSTAND IT THERE'S FOUR DIFFERENT TRIBES THAT MIGHT BE IN THE REGION THAT WOULD QUALIFY FOR MEMBERSHIP. AND IT JUST SAYS THE GOVERNOR WILL CHOOSE FROM A LIST. AND I'M WONDERING. HE THAT PUTS THE GOVERNOR IN A ROUGH BEHIND AND TO SOMEBODY GETS APPOINTED FROM ONE TRIBE AT THE NOT TRUCK JUST GETS TO REPRESENTATION FOR A LONG TIME AND THERE'S NO ROTATION. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER TO MY QUESTION IS BUT I'M WONDERING IF THERE IS A BETTER WAY TO ENSURE A ROTATION OR- OR SOME PARTICIPATION AMONG THE DIFFERENT TRIBES AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A FIXED TERM INVENTED. DEFAULTS TO SOMEBODY ELSE OR OR WHATEVER HAVE YOU GIVEN THOUGHT TO THAT ISSUE AND HOW YOU'RE DOING THIS BILL. FIRST THE THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION AND I DO BELIEVE IT'S- FIVE TOTAL TRIBAL BALCONY NINETY THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED BETWEEN FRESNO AND MADERA COUNTY. AND DO THINK IT IS NECESSARY FOR US TO HAVE TRANSITIONS BETWEEN THE REPRESENTATIONS BETWEEN THE TRIBAL NATIONS. BUT WOULD LIKE THE ORIGINAL STEWARDS OF THE LAND STYLE ALSO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHAPE WHAT THE RIVER LOOKS LIKE. AND WITHOUT PUTTING A SPECIFIC TERM ON IT WOULD HOPE THAT THE TRIBAL NATIONS WOULD SEE THIS. SEAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE EDUCATION ABOUT. WHAT OCCURRED ON THEIR NATIVE LAND SO LONG BEFORE THE CONSERVANCY BEGAN. OKAY I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BUT- THAT JUST HAPPENED GIVE IT SOME THOUGHT BECAUSE THEN THEY'LL BE A BILL BACK IN FRONT OF THE SINCE SIX YEARS BECAUSE IT'S BEEN ONE TRIBE THE OTHERS HAVE SCREAMED. AND SCREAMED OUT EVERYBODY'S CRAZED ABOUT IT AND SO JUST GIVE IT SOME THOUGHT AS YOU MOVE THE BILL ON MY PROJECT. ARE YOUR ENTIRE EFFORT I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING THE BILL. GOOD THANK YOU CENTER LAYERED AND THAT THE VICE CHAIR DID ASK ME IF ANY COULD BE IN OUR IN YOUR CLOTHES BUT JUST TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION- BUT I WOULD SAY. YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE FRAMEWORK HERE I THINK MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. I'M PARTICULARLY SAID ABOUT THE YOUTH MEMBER. JOINING I THINK YOUNG PEOPLE. HAVE A DIFFERENT APPROACH MAY BE TO ISSUES LIKE ACCESS AND EQUITY IN A LOT FOR THE COMMUNITY I THINK. THAT KIND OF LOCAL VOICE EVEN IF IT IS COMING FROM SOME KIND OF. STATE APPOINTMENT. I STILL. THINK WE'LL LIFT- THE COMMUNITY VOICES OVER THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ELEVATE HERE SO- I DON'T SEE. THAT APPOINTMENT PROCESS IS NEGATING THE LOCAL IMPACT- OR- AGENCY THAT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE IN THAT SO APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH US ON THIS LEGISLATION- IF THERE ARE NO OTHER. QUESTIONS SENTENCE CENTER EGGMAN. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS. FORWARD AND LOOKING OUT FOR YOUR AREA LIKE THIS- AND I AND I HEARD A LOT OF TALK ABOUT- THAT THAT THAT DIVERSITY WHICH IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BUT I DON'T HEAR MUCH ABOUT GENDER. I JUST WANT TO KNOW- AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THE CURRENT COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD BUT IF THERE'S GENDER REPRESENTATION AS WELL. AND IF THAT WILL ALSO BE SOME CONSIDERATIONS WOULD LOOK AT. I'M HAPPY TO GET THE INFORMATION BACK TO YOU AND- WILL CONTINUE- THOSE CONVERSATIONS. THANK YOU CENTER EGGMAN CENTER JONES. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN STAR CINEMA ROMULAN AND MAYBE VERY I DO APOLOGIZE FOR HAVING RUN OUT REAL QUICK AND SERVICE RECORD DOWN IN- INSURANCE THERE'S SEEMS TO BE SOME DISCUSSION ON- IN A WORD THIS CONSERVANCY'S LOCATED AND- MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S NOT IT'S NOT IN YOUR DISTRICT IS THAT CORRECT. THIS IS A REGIONAL AMENITY FOR THE ENTIRE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER AS THE SECOND LARGEST RIVER WEEK LONGEST RIVER THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MUCH OF THE RIVER DOES RUN THROUGH MY DESKTOP OKAY. THERE GREAT THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT AND THEN THERE'S ALSO TWO LETTERS OF OPPOSITION FROM THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES. THAT ARE THAT THE CONSERVANCY RUNS IN AND- I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAD SOME COMMENTS YOU KNOW I'M I'M SURE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THEIR- OPPOSITION I CAN READ INTO IF YOU LIKE BUT I JUST WANTED TO. HAVE THAT OTHER MEMBERS CALL ME AND ASK ME TO. IMPAIR PAY ATTENTION THAT SO I JUST WANT TO SEE IF YOU HAVE SOME COMMENTS REGARDING. WELL THE COUNTIES REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE MEASURE THAT'S BEFORE US I WOULD POINT TO THE RESOLUTIONS THAT WERE PASSED BY BOTH THE CITIES. OF FRESNO AND MADERA AS WELL AS THE TESTIMONY WE HEARD TODAY FROM THE MAYOR OF MADERA. THE PEOPLE OF MY COMMUNITY ARE ASKING FOR MORE PARK SPACE AS EVIDENCED BY A RECENT. PROPOSITION THAT WAS PASSED BY THE VOTERS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN FRESNO COUNTY. THAT WAS LED BY THE YOUTH WHO WE ARE NOW HIGHLIGHTING AND- PLACING A SEAT ON TO THIS CONSERVANCY BOARD. AND DO BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE OF MY COMMUNITY ARE ASKING FOR INCREASED PARKS PLACE. OKAY THANK YOU- SEE NO OTHER COMMENTS I WOULD. ENTERTAIN A MOTION AT THIS POINT.

OF THE ANALYSIS TALKS ABOUT FOR REPORTS THAT ARE OVERDUE FROM THE AGENCIES AND I WONDERED IF THE COMMITTEE TAKES ANY ACTION OR REFERS TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE BUT WHAT WE DO TO MAKE SURE THAT REPORTS ARE FORGIVEN US FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON THESE ISSUES. WE'VE WE ACTUALLY IN LIEU OF AN OVERSIGHT HEARING DURING OUR VERY COMPRESSED HEARINGS EARLIER THIS YEAR- WE SENT A LETTER INTO THE ADMINISTRATION. I BELIEVE THAT WAS IN. MARCH LISTING ALL THE ITEMS OUTSTANDING SO FAR THEY'VE THEY'VE SENT US BACK THERE I TO WILL REPORTS THEY'VE HIT ONE BUT THEY'VE GOT TWO OR THREE OTHER CRUCIAL REPORTS OUTSTANDING AS WELL AS A LOT OF THIS WORK. I WAS TOLD BY THE SECRETARY THAT THAT LETTER IS COMING BACK DETAILING- THE TIMELINE- IMMINENTLY BUT- I PROJECT INITIATIVE IMMINENCE I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT TO RAISE. THE OVERSIGHT ROLE THE BUDGET LETTERMAN WEREN'T JULY I DON'T KNOW WHAT EMINENT MEANS BUT THE DISTRIBUTORS RESPONSE TO THE COMMITTEE. MEMBERS BECAUSE UNDER YOURS WOULD BE. IMPORTANT FOR AND TO SENATOR Y. CASKEY IS CHAIR OF THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE- I THINK WE IT WOULD REALLY BENEFIT US IN THE DISCUSSION OF THIS BILL TO HAVE THOSE REPORTS AND SO ARE THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO DO.

THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAY BE NEW TO SACRAMENTO CERTAINLY NOT NEW TO THE OIL AND GAS REGULATION AND HAS BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES FOR A WHILE AND- VENTURA. COUNTY AND SANTA BARBARA COUNTY NOW- BUT I WOULD I WOULD JUST SAY IS THAT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DO HAVE LEGISLATION TO DO THIS WORK A LOT OF THAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING AND- SO YOU KNOW THESE THIS IS. A LESS EFFICIENT WAY POTENTIALLY TO GET IT ALTHOUGH I WOULD SAY THAT THERE'S SOME USEFUL TOOLS PROVIDED HERE BY THE AUTHOR WHEN IT COMES TO LEAD AUTHORITY AND ALSO ESTABLISHING THIS COLLECTIONS UNIT. I THINK IT'SA REALLY WISE APPROACH TO SORT OF FORMALIZE THAT BUT THERE'S NO REPLACEMENT FOR JUST THROUGHPUT I'M I WOULD NOTE THOUGH- YOU KNOW APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WORK OF THE COMMITTEE AND TAKING THIS ON- IT. THE DELAYS IN DERIVING AT THAT DETERMINATION. OF- I. OF THAT WELL AS ACTUALLY DOES AND GO THROUGH THAT TYPE SEARCH NOT JUST IDOL WELL.

YOU KNOW WE THINK THIS BILL IS GOING TO MOVE THAT FORWARD BUT THE AUTHOR AND I WOULD. BE SOLID UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S IF THERE'S MORE WORK WE NEED TO BE DOING. A TO PUSH THAT ALONG OR FREE UP CAL JIM. DOING A TITLE SURGERY AT A COUNTY RECORD OFFICE ALL IN A HOUSE AND WAITING FOR THAT. PROCESS TO TAKE A YEAR OR TWO IS SIMPLY NOT GOING TO WORK AS A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL FOR WELL REMEDIATION IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET.

THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A PROGRAM WITHIN THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD. TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR PROJECTS IN THE CALIFORNIA DESERT TO ADDRESS THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE TO PROTECT AND RESTORE DESERT HABITAT AND SACRED ANCESTRAL LANDS OF LOCAL NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THIS ALSO PROVIDES PUBLIC ACCESS OR RECREATIONAL AMENITIES AND REDUCES THE THREATS OF WILDFIRE DROUGHT FLOODS AND OTHER CONTRASTS CATASTROPHE EVENTS. THE CALIFORNIA DESERT'S MERIT INCREASE PUBLIC ATTENTION AND INVESTMENT THE DESERT REGION IS HOME TO THE LARGEST STILL INTACT ECOSYSTEM IN THE CONTINUOUS UNITED STATES. THESE LAST PERFORM CRITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL ROLES INCLUDING CAPTURING AND STORING CARBON TO HELP US FIGHT THE CLIMATE CHANGE CRISIS.

THAT'S SO IMPORTANT AND VITAL THIS BILL IS IN PROTECTING OUR AREAS IN THE DESERT. AB ELEVEN EIGHTY THREE WILL ASSIST IN SUPPORTING THE PROTECTION OF THESE KINDS OF SITES AND MANY OTHERS. UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA FUNDED INITIATIVES INCLUDING PASSED BONDS HAVE INVESTED FAR LESS CONSERVATION FUNDING INTO THE DESERT THAN OTHER AREAS OF CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY THOSE REGIONS WITH EXISTING STATE. CUTS SERVICE CONSERVANCIES. AB ELEVEN EIGHTY THREE PROVIDES A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. BY CREATING A PROGRAM WITH THE WCB FOCUSED ON FUNDING IMPORTANT PROJECTS WITHIN THIS REGION.

DO YOU HAVE ANY IN THE- CHAMBERS I THINK OUR LEAD UP THIS WILL BE AMY GREEN NOT. FROM THE OFF ROAD VEHICLE LEGISLATION LEGISLATIVE COALITION. AND GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN STERN COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN THE GRANITE OFF ROAD VEHICLE LEGISLATIVE COALITION THE SIMPLE TRUTH AB FIFTEEN TWELVE INVOLVES THOSE WITH WEALTH AND POLITICAL CONNECTIONS THINKING TO TAKE AWAY LAND AN OPPORTUNITY FROM EVERY DAY CALIFORNIANS CONTRARY TO ALL THAT HAS BEEN SAID. HAS SHOWN THAT MANY OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN MOTORI RECREATION TO THE CARNEGIE AREA COME FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY FROM TRADITIONALISTS ADVANTAGE COMMUNITIES. WITH OVER 40% BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWENTY FIVE AND FORTY EIGHT IDENTIFYING AS HISPANIC. THIS ISSUE IS NO DIFFERENT FROM THOSE WITH WEALTH AND POWER WOULD SEEK TO PRIVATIZE NAY JASINSKI EACH TO THEIR BEEF BEACHFRONT HOMES IN ORDER TO DEPRIVE ACT THAT THE AVERAGE CITIZEN. WE'VE ALL HEARD AND BEEN APPALLED BY THE STORY THE WEALTHY POLITICALLY CONNECTED INDIVIDUALS LOCAL CURRENTLY CARNEGIE INITIALLY SIGNED OFF ON THE PURCHASE OF THE LAND BY THE DELHI TREE TRUST FUND AND DEDICATED ONLY TO BE RECOGNITION. PURCHASED WITH THE MONEY IN THE TRUCKS DERIVE SOLELY FROM FEES PAID BY THE OXFORD COMMUNITY. NOW HE'S WEALTHY AND POWERFUL INDIVIDUALS ARE SEEKING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR OPPORTUNITIES WHO PAID FOR THIS PARK AB FIFTY TWELVE PROPOSES TO CREATE A DE FACTO EXCLUSIVE PRESERVE. SOLELY DEVELOP PRIVATE AGENDA BY THE WEALTHY AND POWERFUL THE FACT WILL DEPRIVE CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO PAID FOR THE PARK WITH THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE FUN AND ENJOY A DAY IN THE STATE PARK. DOING WHAT THEY LOVE TO DO. THE SAME LOCAL INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE MONEY TO CONSTANTLY FILE LAWSUITS COSTING THE TAXPAYERS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN ORDER TO HAMSTRING STATE PARKS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THIS AREA SIMPLY PUT THEY'LL DO ANYTHING TO GET THEIR WAY. BUT AVERAGE CALIFORNIANS CAN'T FILE LAWSUITS HERE A FEW YEARS SEEKING THEIR RIGHTS TO ENJOY STATE PARK IN THE MANNER THAT EVERYDAY HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS MAKES. BUT WEALTHY AND POLITICALLY CONNECTED SHOULD NOT HAVE THE POWER TO USURP THE RIGHTS OF EVERY DAY CALIFORNIANS BUT THIS IS A GOOD EXACTLY WHAT THE SUBJECT OF AB. FIFTEEN TWELVE ACCOMPLISHES. AS TOUGH AS IT IS TO SPEAK TO POWER. SB FIFTY TWELVE ISN'T THE AND- IN END IF ABOUT ENDANGERED SPECIES.BECAUSE WE HAVE AN NAY THE PAR APART AND REC. THAT COULD NT AND WOULD NOT ALLOW ANY. ARE TO BE TO. QUITE THE- THEY PROTECT NATURAL CULTURAL RESOURCES AND ALLSTATE. REGARDLESS OF ALLOWED ACTIVITY. THE PROJECTED USE OF THIS PARK WITH ITS CURRENT DESIGNATION WOULD PICK UP. TEN OF THE TOTAL LAND MASS ONLY 10% WHILE ALLOWING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND BAY AREA TO HAVE FUN IN THE SAFE ENVIRONMENT. AND ALLOWING DISABLED PEOPLE TO CAMP IN A BUILDING MORE WILDERNESS ENVIRONMENT WHICH GIVES THE- PARK DOES NOT OFFER THROUGHOUT THEIR PARK IN THE BAY. AREA WE FURTHER ENVIRONMENT PER. MEASURES AND THAT'S WHAT. AB TWO FOR THE ONLY. AS AN AVENUE TO HER THE P. OF PAID FOR THE PER. AND PAID TWENTY YEARS AND MANAGEMENT OF THIS PROPERTY BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE JUST LIKE ME. SEVENTEEN BY WEALTHY AND POWERFUL PEOPLE TO BE EXTRANEOUS UNNECESSARY AND UNIMPORTANT. WELL THE NEED TO THE WEALTHY- SEEMINGLY TAKES CENTER STAGE IN EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN TWELVE. THE NEED THE NEED TO THE EVERYDAY CALIFORNIANS ARE BEING DISCARDED. THANK YOU THANKS SO MUCH FOR TESTIMONY.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE YOU ARE TRACK OKAY VICE CHAIR OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DEMOCRATIC PARTY CHAIR AT THE CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY ENVIRONMENTAL CAUCUS I WHO WISH TO APOLOGIZE SOME REASON I COULD NOT GET IN IN SUPPORT AT THE WHITE TIME- THAT STATE AND BE COUNTY PARTY ARE BOTH IN TALKS OF THE LEGISLATION THAT YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU YOUR OTHERS IN OPPOSITION NOW'S THE TIME. MISTER CHAIRPERSON HAVE KNOWN ALL SECURE THIS TIME OKAY VERY GOOD WILL BRING BACK TO THE DICE THAN MEMBERS COMMENTS QUESTIONS AS HE CENTER LAYERED. BUT JUST A OF A COMMON QUESTION AND- THE COMMENT IS TO IT. FOR TEN YEARS MY ADVICE TO HOLD SECESSION SUCCESSION OF LEGISLATORS IS THAT THE WAY TO SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISH THIS. IS TO BUY OUT DEAL WHICH FEE FUND AND THAT'S WHAT THE SEPARATE DOLLARS AND THAT. MAKES TOTAL SENSE MY QUESTION IS THAT WE PASSED OUT A BILL BY SENATOR GLAZERS EARLIER IN THE SESSION THAT WAS SIMILAR. AND THERE'S A BUDGET REQUEST FOR THIS THAT IS DIFFERENT TELL US. HOW ALL THREE OF THESE FIT TOGETHER AND WHAT THE STATUSES. YES AT MY UNDERSTANDING ALTHOUGH I DON'T LIKE TO SPEAK FOR THE LEGISLATORS THE SENATOR GLAZERS LEGISLATION IS NOT MOVING AT THIS TIME SO THIS IS THE ONLY PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT REMAINS MOVING. AND YES ALTHOUGH THE BUDGET SEEMS LIKE A PERFECTLY REASONABLE PLACE TO DO THIS EXCHANGE. WE ARE DOING IT THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AT THIS TIME MEDINA IS THAT MEANS THAT YOU DON'T THINK THE BUDGET RQUEST IS MOVING A LITTLE IT WAS IN AS YOU MAY KNOW IS IN THE BUDGET WE PASSED INITIALLY I WAS NOT IN THE BUDGET THAT WE PASSED. LAST WEEK I LOST TRACK OF TIME- WHATEVER THIS THAT AGREED UPON BUDGET WISE SO IT IS NO LONGER IN THE BUDGET LANGUAGE ON- THAT SAYS A LOT IF IT WAS IN THE TWO PARTY AGREEMENT AND NOT A THREE PARTY AGREEMENT THAT. THAT IS A STATEMENT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL THANK YOU FOR RESPONDING SENATORS THANK YOU CENTER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. YES MISS RESTAURANT. TEACHER I AS SOON THANK YOU- AT- MY- POSITION ON THE- BEEN. PRETTY CLEAR ALL ALONG- EVEN WHEN I WAS I THE ASSEMBLY. BUT TO CONCERNS PARTICULARLY ON THIS BILL REGARDING THE NINE MILLION DOLLARS. ONE IS IT DIRECTS PARKS TO GET THE NINE MILLION DOLLARS BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY. PRESENT A SOLID GUARANTEE. THAT THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN SO I JUST WANT YOU COULD SPEAK TO THAT- AND THEN NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT JUST ON. ST INFLATION IS WORTH FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS- ONE OF THE- OPPONENTS SPOKE ABOUT FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT LAND IS DONE AND I'M SURE IT'S GONNA WELL I KNOW IT'S KIND OF A LOT I DON'T KNOW WHAT HOW MUCH BUT IT. CERTAINLY BE TO SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IT WOULD BE THE RIGHT NUMBER SO I JUST WANT HOW YOU. YOU KNOW HI HOW YOU ARRIVED TO THE NINE MILLION DOLLARS WITHOUT. YOU KNOW I COUNTING FOR INFLATION OR GROWTH OF THE LAND VALUE YES SELAHATTIN HAVE INTEREST BOTH THOSE QUESTIONS CENTER THANK YOU SO THE FIRST ONE IS THE BILL SAYS THAT IT WILL BE PRESERVED ONCE THE MONEY IS RECEIVED SO I THINK THAT GUARANTEES THAT IF THE MONEY'S NOT RECEIVED THE LAND WILL NOT BE PRESERVED IN PERPETUITY SO HOPEFULLY THAT ADDRESSES YOUR FIRST CONCERN AS FOR YOUR SECOND CONCERN- WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE BENEFIT OF A RECENT LANDS- FOR SALE JUST SOUTH AND ADJACENT TO. THIS LAND TO THE M. THREE PROPERTY WENT ON THE MARKET AND HAS BEEN ACTUALLY JUST HAD AN OFFER PUT ON IT AND THAT LAND WHICH IS VERY SIMILAR IN NATURE SO THIS PLAN IS NOT AVAILABLE IN FACT ALAMEDA COUNTY PASSED A- PROPOSITION. SAID THAT YOU COULD NOT DEVELOP THIS LAND SO IT DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME VALUE AS YOUR TYPICAL EVEN LAND IN LIVERMORE- AND SO IT DOES NOT HAVE WHAT I THINK. THE VALUE THAT IS BEING PROPOSED BY THE OPPOSITION AND IN FACT. AND THREE WHICH WAS APPRAISED APPRAISED AT ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS AN ACRE. AND IF YOU WERE TO DO THE MATH ON THIS LAND AT THAT WOULD BE THREE MILLION DOLLARS SO IN FACT. BASED ON THAT APPRAISAL I BELIEVE THE NINE MILLION DOLLARS IS GENEROUS. BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT DOESN'T HAVE A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR VALUE. ON THE END THREE. PROPERTY WHICH IS FIFTY MILLION ACRES A FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES AS OPPOSED TO THIS THREE THOUSAND. WITH THE PRICE OF FIFTY MILLION. IT'S IN THREE IS OR IT ISN'T THREE IS LAND JUST SOUTH. OKAY THANK YOU. SEEN NO FURTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS- AS THE- NEPHEW OF A RANCHER AND TRACY AND FAMILY AT LIVERMORE AND- I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S PART OF THE SAVE THE FROGS COALITION WITH THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE.
