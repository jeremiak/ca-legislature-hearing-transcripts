THANK YOU CHEN MCCORMACK BEEN ESTABLISH WE HAVE ONE BILL TODAY WE WELCOME THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SAN JOSE APPRECIATE ALL AS WORK THIS ON SENATE BILL ONE TWENTY EIGHT WE'RE LOOKING THIS TO BE POTENTIALLY OUR LAST HEARING BUT PROBABLY NOT WE'LL BE LOOKING AT ANOTHER POTENTIAL HEARING EITHER NEXT WEEK OR THE WEEK AFTER. WITH SOME ASSEMBLY BILLS THAT ARE HEADING OUR WAY WITH THAT WILL TURN IT OVER TO THE GOOD CENTER FROM SAN JOSE WELCOME SIR. OF THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THIS SO BILL SB ONE TWENTY EIGHT. IS ABOUT BEST VALUE CONTRACTING NOW. THE REASON THIS BILL THIS IS BEFORE YOU TODAY AS. YOUR SPECIAL HEARING IS THIS BILL. THE LAW EXPIRES AT THE END OF THE YEAR SO WE HAVE TO KIND OF. YOU KNOW RENEW IT SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. THIS BILL WOULD EXTEND THE EXISTING SUNSET. OF THE BEST VALUE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTING PROGRAM AND ALLOW FIVE ADDITIONAL YEARS. WILL ADD SANTA CLARA COUNTY TO THE PILOT. CONTRACTS FOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS ARE SELECTED UTILIZING LOW COST METHODS AS A RESULT THE FACTORS FACTORS SUCH AS RESPONSIBILITY LABOR STANDARDS DELAYS OFTEN GO OVERLOOKED IN FAVOR THE CHEAPEST POSSIBLE OPTION. AND FAVOR CONSIDER SUCH FACTORS CAN LEAD TO INCREASED COST AND TOTAL VALUE OR COSTS OF THE PROJECT. THE BEST VALUE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTING PROGRAM CREATES A LARGER CONTRACTOR BUILDING POOL ARE REDUCES BAD ACTORS INCREASES THE AMOUNT. SUNSETS AS I SAID AT THE END OF THE YEAR. AND WHILE MANY CALORIES ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF IMPLEMENTING THESE PROGRAMS WE NEED TO EXTEND THIS. WE HAVE WITNESSES ALL TURN OVER THEM THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER BALLOTS ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE MISTER HUMMEL HERE NOW A SOLANO COUNTY ABOUT WITH US IN CASE COULD YOU SEE SIR WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE A KICK US OFF. HERE PLEASE FROM THE FORESHORES YOUR TWO MINUTES SIR. THANK YOU FROM AGO ARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I REMARKABLE CAPITAL PROJECT MANAGER FOR SOLANO COUNTY THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL ONE TWENTY EIGHT THE CARD APPRECIATE SENATOR BELT BRING THIS LEGISLATION FORWARD. RECENTLY SOLANO COUNTY SUCCESSFULLY DELIVERED THE NEW YORK VOCATIONAL TRAINING CENTER AND FAIRFIELD. THE I. VTEC AS A FORTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR DETENTION GRADE RE ENTRY FACILITY CONSTRUCTED FOR THE SOLANO COUNTY SHERIFF. IT WAS THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS SB TEN TWENTY TWO PROGRAM. THE FLORA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS UTILIZED THE BEST VALUE PROCUREMENT PROCESS TO AWARD THE EIGHTEEN AND A HALF MILLION DOLLAR CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT. THE BEST VALUE DELIVERY OPPORTUNITY ATTRACTED WELL QUALIFIED CONTRACTOR TO SUBMIT PROPOSALS TO SOLANO COUNTY COMPETING BASED ON QUALITY CRITERIA AND PRICE INCLUDING RELEVANT PROJECT EXPERIENCE HIM QUALIFICATIONS AT ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS TO THE PROJECT OFFERED BY THE PROPOSING FARM. HENSEL PHELPS CONSTRUCTION COMPANY WAS AWARDED THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT ON THE OVERALL STRENGTH OF THEIR PROPOSAL REPRESENTING BEST VALUE TO THE COUNTY. HERSCHEL PHELPS WORK IN A HIGHLY PROFESSIONAL AND DILIGENT MANNER TO EFFECTIVELY DELIVER THE PROJECT DESPITE UNFORESEEN CHALLENGES THAT AROSE DURING CONSTRUCTION. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTING THIS DETENTION GRADE PROJECT WOULD'VE GONE AS WELL WHAT DELIVER EQUIVALENT VALUE BY WAY OF A MORE TRADITIONAL LOW BID CONTRACT AWARD PROCESS. WHAT WORKS WELL. THE PROCESS UNDER PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION A CONTACT CODE TWENTY ONE FIFTY FIVE CURRENTLY ALLOWS CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS TO BE 1100% COMPLETE BEFORE BIDDING. WHICH IS DESIRABLE FOR MORE SPECIALIZED OR MORE COMPLEX PROJECT OVER WITH THE COUNTY WHICH YOU TO RETAIN A HIGHER LEVEL OF DESIGN CONTROL. THE COUNTY WAS ABLE TO SELECT A FIRM BASED ON WHO WILL BE RUNNING THE PROJECT AND NOT JUST ACCEPT WHOEVER THE CONTRACTOR DECIDE TO SEND OVER. QUALIFIED OR NOT. IT PROMOTED A COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TEAM WORK TOGETHER WITH THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR TO DETERMINE PROBLEM RESOLUTION INSTEAD OF JUST GETTING THE USUAL. THE PROBLEM TELL ME HOW TO FIX IT. LEADING TO OUTSIDE THE BOX THINKING ON HOW TO MAKE THE PROJECT BETTER. RATHER DOWN BY YOU TO JUST TO GET WHAT IS MINIMALLY REQUIRED. WHAT COULD IMPROVE YOU'RE STILL NOT A FULL PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CONTRACTOR BUT IT'S A LOT BETTER THAN THE ADVERSARIAL ENVIRONMENT THAT IS TOO OFTEN ENCOUNTERED AND STATE LUMP SUM BETTER. WITH A CHALLENGING PROVISIONS IN THE LEGISLATION AS IT CURRENTLY READS DROPPED IT THERE IS A THOUSAND CURRENTLY STANDS THERE WERE NO SPECIFIC ISSUES THE ONLY CHALLENGE WAS CREATING THE PROCUREMENT DOCUMENTS FROM SCRATCH. SINCE NO ONE ELSE HAS DONE IT YET OR HAD DONE IT YET. BUT THE DOCUMENTS ARE NOW AVAILABLE FOR USE ON FUTURE PROJECTS SUCH A LOT OF COUNTY AND MAY SERVE AS A GUIDE FOR ANY OTHER CALIFORNIA COUNTIES ALLOWED TO USE BEST ALL YOUR PROCUREMENT UNDER THE LEGISLATION. THIRTY SECONDS. BEST VALUE PROCUREMENT IS NOT THE SOLUTION EVERY PROJECT BUT IT IS CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE FOR SOME PROJECTS. IT IS USEFUL TOOL TO HELP.
