01:25:42.871 --> 01:25:43.738
LOT FOR PEOPLE TO GO DOOR TO

DOOR LITERALLY. GETTING BALLOTS

IS THAT REALLY THE BEST

01:25:46.508 --> 01:25:48.243
PRACTICE IN THIS NOVEMBER

01:25:48.309 --> 01:25:50.345
ELECTION. TO ALLOW THAT TO

01:25:50.411 --> 01:25:52.647
CONTINUE. I PERSONALLY THINK

01:25:52.714 --> 01:25:55.149
THAT WE SHOULD. SCALE THAT BACK

01:25:55.216 --> 01:25:56.618
CONSIDERING THE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:25:56.684 --> 01:25:57.852
WERE AND ALL THIS IS REALLY

01:25:57.919 --> 01:25:58.987
FOCUSED ON THE NOVEMBER

01:25:59.053 --> 01:26:00.488
ELECTION AND SOCIAL

01:26:00.555 --> 01:26:02.657
CIRCUMSTANCES. THAT WE FIND

01:26:02.724 --> 01:26:04.459
OURSELVES AND SO THAT THAT THAT

01:26:04.526 --> 01:26:07.729
IS ONE CONCERN AYE. AS WILL

01:26:07.795 --> 01:26:09.430
CONTINUE TO HAVE. AND THEN AS

01:26:09.497 --> 01:26:12.667
AS WE'VE DISCUSSED I CERTAINLY

01:26:12.734 --> 01:26:15.203

DAY FOR THAT BOTH TO BE COUNTED.

01:26:21.943 --> 01:26:23.645
YOU DID IN YOUR LEGISLATION

01:26:23.711 --> 01:26:25.079

01:26:25.146 --> 01:26:26.748
AUTHENTICATE BALLOTS THAT COME

01:26:26.814 --> 01:26:27.849
AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE

01:26:27.916 --> 01:26:29.551
POSTMARK. FOR INSTANCE THAT'S

01:26:29.617 --> 01:26:32.053
ONE WAY TO AUTHENTICATE- BUT

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:33.855
WERE ALLOWING UP TO SEVENTEEN

01:26:33.922 --> 01:26:35.323
DAYS FOR ABOUT TO COME IN AND

01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:36.658
SOME OF THOSE DOUBTS MIGHT NOT

01:26:36.724 --> 01:26:38.560
HAVE A POSTMARK. YOU KNOW THERE

01:26:38.626 --> 01:26:39.827

THINK WE- I THINK WE CAN DO

01:26:54.642 --> 01:26:56.177
THIS THIS DOES HELP PROVIDE FOR

01:26:56.244 --> 01:26:57.378
A SAY PROCESS BUT THOSE ARE

01:26:57.445 --> 01:26:59.013
SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT I.

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:00.248

YOU HAVE DONE IN TERMS OF

01:27:09.490 --> 01:27:10.992
TAKING THIS ISSUE ON AND REALLY

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:13.394
GETTING. A LOT OF THE INPUT TO

01:27:13.461 --> 01:27:14.862
MAKE SURE THIS IS BOTH A SAFE.

01:27:14.929 --> 01:27:18.566
AND THAT WE ENSURE THAT THERE'S

01:27:18.633 --> 01:27:20.835
PROPER PROTECTIONS. OF THE VOTE

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:21.936
BUT I'LL JUST GIVE YOU AN

01:27:22.003 --> 01:27:23.071

THE SPREAD OF THE CROWN OF OURS

01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:36.851
I THINK THE LAST THING. THAT

01:27:36.918 --> 01:27:37.952
WOULD WANT TO DO IS TO TELL A

01:27:38.019 --> 01:27:40.088
VOTER THAT THEY CAN'T ASK

01:27:40.154 --> 01:27:41.189
SOMEONE THAT THEY TRUST. TO

RETURN THERE. I AND INSTEAD

01:27:43.324 --> 01:27:44.959
FORCE THE VOTER LEAVE HOME TO.

01:28:21.262 --> 01:28:22.497
KNOW THAT THAT WOULD BE

01:28:22.563 --> 01:28:23.231
SOMETHING THAT IF IT DOES

01:28:23.297 --> 01:28:25.133
HAPPEN IS ALREADY VERY VERY

01:28:25.199 --> 01:28:28.236
ILLEGAL- AND IT IS A FELONY.

01:28:28.302 --> 01:28:29.704
THERE WAS A FELLA THERE'S ONE

01:28:29.771 --> 01:28:30.838
OTHER ISSUE THAT YOU MENTIONED

THAT I WANTED TO ADDRESS- BUT

01:28:33.841 --> 01:28:36.778
YEAH THE ISSUE OF ALLOWING

01:28:36.844 --> 01:28:39.580
DOLLAR RIDE UP TO SEVENTEEN

01:28:39.647 --> 01:28:40.181
DAYS AFTER THE ELECTION TO BE

01:28:40.248 --> 01:28:42.383
COUNTED. NOT WITH SOME OF THOSE

01:28:42.450 --> 01:28:46.387
BROUGHT TO US BY. A SUPPORTED

01:28:46.454 --> 01:28:48.356
AT LEAST BY. YEAH CAL. SO OF

01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:49.390
CLERKS AND ALLOW. IF EXPRESSLY

01:28:49.457 --> 01:28:51.092
ADVOCATED FOR THIS. OR A

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:52.694
SIMILAR PROVISION- THEMSELVES

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:54.028
AT THE CONCLUSION OF WORKING

01:28:54.095 --> 01:28:55.530
GROUP DISCUSSIONS THAT. THE

01:28:55.596 --> 01:28:57.598
SECRETARY OF STATE HAD CONVENE-

01:28:57.665 --> 01:28:58.633
AND IT'S REALLY JUST AN

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:01.369
INSURANCE BACKSTOPS. BECAUSE IN

01:29:01.436 --> 01:29:02.470
THE MIDDLE OF JUNE WE DON'T

01:29:02.537 --> 01:29:03.671
KNOW WHAT THE SITUATION IS

01:29:03.738 --> 01:29:05.773
GOING TO BE LIKE. IN NOVEMBER

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.275
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT.

01:29:07.341 --> 01:29:08.576
INTERNATIONAL ALL IS GONNA BE

01:29:08.643 --> 01:29:10.445
LIKE SO I THINK IN THE BILL

01:29:10.511 --> 01:29:12.380
THERE'S ENOUGH PROTECTIONS TO

01:29:12.447 --> 01:29:14.749
MAKE SURE THAT IF A BALLOT DOES

01:29:14.816 --> 01:29:18.152
HAPPEN TO ARRIVE- YOU KNOW

01:29:18.219 --> 01:29:18.686
FOURTEEN DAYS FIFTEEN DAYS

01:29:18.753 --> 01:29:20.655
SIXTY DAYS SEVENTEEN DAYS AFTER

01:29:20.722 --> 01:29:22.190
THE ELECTION. STRONG SECURITY

01:29:22.256 --> 01:29:24.125
MAKING SURE IT. THAT'S BECAUSE

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:25.660
OF THE FAULT OF THE POSTAL

01:29:25.727 --> 01:29:27.295
SERVICE OR SOMETHING IN THE

01:29:27.361 --> 01:29:28.763
MAIL STREAM IT'S NOT THE FULL

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:30.998
OF THE VOTER. AND I THINK THAT

01:29:31.065 --> 01:29:32.133
WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING THAT WE

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.167
CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:29:33.234 --> 01:29:36.037
VOTERS VOICES HER- SO THAT'S

01:29:36.104 --> 01:29:37.338
ALL THAT'S TRYING TO ADDRESS

01:29:37.405 --> 01:29:39.674
AND AGAIN IT YOU KNOW IF I

01:29:39.741 --> 01:29:42.677
VOTER WORK TO LINE- AND- ON THE

01:29:42.744 --> 01:29:44.846
BALLOT. OR ON THEIR OWN THE

01:29:44.912 --> 01:29:46.380
BILL BY MAIL ENVELOPE. THAT IS

01:29:46.447 --> 01:29:48.716
DIFFERENT THAT'S A FELONY- AND

01:29:48.783 --> 01:29:49.650
WE HAVE STRONG LEGAL

01:29:49.717 --> 01:29:50.752
PROTECTIONS IN PLACE TO MAKE

01:29:50.818 --> 01:29:52.487
SURE THAT. YOU KNOW IF THOSE

01:29:52.553 --> 01:29:54.355
PEOPLE- ARE FOUND TO HAVE LIED

01:29:54.422 --> 01:29:56.023
AND POST DATED THEIR THEIR

01:29:56.090 --> 01:29:57.925
BALLOTS. THEY'LL THEY'LL BE

01:29:57.992 --> 01:30:00.094
PROSECUTED FOR THAT SO. I THINK

01:30:00.161 --> 01:30:01.295

01:30:09.504 --> 01:30:10.037
THINGS THAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN

01:30:10.104 --> 01:30:12.807
NOVEMBER- YEAH THAT THE KIND OF

01:30:12.874 --> 01:30:14.142
WORST CASE SCENARIOS. TO MAKE

SURE THAT WE PROTECT VOTER

01:30:15.076 --> 01:30:16.177
