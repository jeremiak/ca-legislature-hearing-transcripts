AFTER MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS AND SEVENTY FIVE BILLS LATER THE BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM NO LONGER REFLECTS THE NEEDS NO LONGER REFLECTS CAPABILITIES AND NO LONGER REFLECTS THE TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE TO EXERCISE THESE VALUABLE RESOURCES WHILE CUTTING WAYS THIS BILL BEFORE YOU SB THREE SEVENTY TWO IS THE CULMINATION OF MANY YEARS OF EFFORTS I'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR FOUR YEARS FIFTEEN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAMS FOR THEIR BEVERAGE CONTAINERS. IT'S BASED ON FORMER GOVERNOR BROWN SAID EXTENSIVE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS WHICH UNFORTUNATELY DID NOT RESULT IN A BILL AN ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OVERSIGHT HEARING TO TRY CHAIRED A COUPLE YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE REPORT CAL. ONLY PAPER FROM A COUPLE YEARS AGO FROM NINETEEN OUR. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AS WELL AS IT YOUR- RE. AND BY IN ME I HAVE A COPY HERE A THE CAL BEVERAGE CONTAINER PROGRAM THIS ORGANIZATION WROTE THE RULES IN THE IN THE E. U. ON THEIR E. P. R. PROGRAM. IT'S BASED ON EXHAUSTED MEETINGS WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND I'M HERE TO REPRESENT THAT THIS BILL IS IF THE THIS BILL SUCCESSFUL TODAY IN GETS OFF THE FLOOR THOSE EXHAUSTIVE MEETINGS WILL CONTINUE EVERYBODY IS GOING TO BE AT THE TABLE IN SORT OF INFORMING. IN A CREATING A PROGRAM THAT'S GOING TO WORK. VISITS AND MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH MEMBERS OF FROM OREGON THE BRITISH COLUMBIA IN NORWAY OFFICIALS WHO WERE RUNNING MUCH MORE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS AND WE ARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL EMBRACES FOUR MAJOR PRINCIPLES AND IT'S A COMPREHENSIVE AND COST SAVING SOLUTION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FIRST. ITS GOAL IS TO IMPROVE RECYCLING IN REMANUFACTURING HERE IN CALIFORNIA SECOND IT SHARED RESPONSE RESPONSIBILITIES NOT ONE. ONE ENTITY SECOND IT ENHANCES ADAPTABILITY INSISTING ABILITIES. AND FOURTH IT HAS NO CARVE OUTS THAT'S RIGHT WHOEVER IS PART OF THE PROBLEM MUST BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. NOW OUR CURRENT BOTTLE BILL IN CALIFORNIA COST OVER FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY JUST IN THE MINISTRATION WHAT CAL RECYCLE I KNOW SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT. OUR WOULD LOOK FOR A LEANER GOVERNMENT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN SB THREE TWENTY TWO TO SUPPORT- THE KNOWLEDGE ME THAT WE HAVE A BROKEN BOTTLE PROGRAM AND WE'RE GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO PRIVATE INDUSTRY. TO RUN. AND SB THREE SEVENTY TWO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS BY REMOVING THE REDEMPTION AND RECYCLING ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITIES TO THIS NEW PRIVATELY RUN THE STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM IT'S TIME TO CANDACE PROGRAM IN ITS CURRENT FORM AND START FRESH THE SP THREE SEVENTY TWO DOES THE FOLLOWING IT CREATES A DISTRIBUTOR STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM THAT DISTRIBUTORS SHORTS A PROGRAM I'VE SEEN THE LETTERS IT INCLUDES THE MANUFACTURES INCLUDES THIS TRIGGERS INCLUDES TO RETAIL OUTLETS IT INVOLVES ALL STAKEHOLDERS IT EXPANDS THIS PROGRAM TO INCLUDE WINE AND DISTILLED. SPIRITS THIS IS A LONG DISCUSS AN OVERDUE MEASURE TO INCLUDE THE NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION BOTTLES THAT CONSUMERS ARE CONSTITUENTS MISS OUT ON BEER IS ALREADY IN AND LET'S FINALLY STEP UP TO THE WINE INDUSTRY TO MAKE THEM BE THE ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDS THEY CLAIM TO BE I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL THE MEMBERS IN THOSE OPPOSITION LETTERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY COME TOGETHER IN A COHESIVE WAY SB THREE SEVENTY TWO WILL PUTS GOVERNMENT'S ROLE THIS IS CAL RECYCLES ROLE BUT THIS NOT. LIMITED ITS RESPONSIBILITY IT REQUIRED CAL RECYCLE TO ESTABLISH A MINIMUM CONTENT REQUIREMENTS FOR BOTTLES SB THREE SEVENTY TWO LET THE EXPERTS TO THE JOBS THAT IS IT LET'S BUSINESSES MAKE MORE TERM TO SEE THAT WILL BENEFIT THEIR COST. WE PUT. EVERYBODY IS. THERE'S CARVE OUTS SPEAK PLAY ON THE SAME PLAYING FIELD AND THIS THE STATE DOES WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO DO IT SAID SCHOOLS AND OVERSEES THE PROGRAMS THE STAKEHOLDERS KNOW THEIR INDUSTRY BASS SO IF THEY JOIN THE PCS SO PROCESS IT WORK IT OUT AND THEY COME TO THE GREEN MAN AND A PLAN THE- THE BILL IN IN PRINT RIGHT NOW PUTS A STARK DATED JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TO GIVE THIS PROCESS OF THE NAP TIME. WE HAVE A CHOICE TODAY MEMBERS. WE CAN CONTINUE TO SUCCUMB TO THE WELL HEELED A SPECIAL INTERESTS AND DO NOTHING AND LET A FAILED PROGRAM CONTINUE TO FAIL. WE CAN CONTINUE A SYSTEM WHERE THE WINE INDUSTRY CURBSIDE WASTE HAULERS AND DISTRIBUTORS CONTINUE THEIR STREAK RECEIVED SPECIAL FAVORS FROM US AT THE EXPENSE OF THE CONSUMERS. OR WE CAN FINALLY PUT CONSUMERS FIRST THE CONSUMERS ARE OUR CONSTITUENTS WE CAN FINALLY CREATE A SYSTEM THAT PUTS MONEY BACK INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE THAT DESERVE IT. OUR CONSTITUENTS TO DAY IF A CONSTITUENT CONFINED RECYCLING CENTER THAT IS OPEN THAT WILL TAKE BACK THEIR NICKEL BOTTLE THAT THEY PAY FOR THEY WILL GET TWO POINT THREE FIVE CENTS LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT THEY PAID. COLLEAGUES THERE'S BEEN SOME CONCERNS ABOUT REDEMPTION CENTERS LET ME LEAVE YOU WITH ONE FINAL THOUGHT. OR AGAIN WHICH HAS A SIMILAR PROGRAM IS BEING PROPOSED IN THEIR SB THREE SEVENTY TWO HAS ONE TENTH OF OUR POPULATION BUT OVER TWICE AS MANY CONSUMER REDEMPTION POINTS. IN CALIFORNIA HAS. WHAT WE WELL WE SEEM TO BE CLOSER RETENTION CENTERS MONTHLY ORGAN IS MAKING EXPANSION PLANS. SB THREE SEVENTY TWO IS A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION A LONG TERM SOLUTION TO A VERY COMPLEX PROBLEM BUT IT'S TIME THAT WE FINALLY TAKE ACTIONS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU AYE MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL- INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH- I WAS PART OF A GROUP OF PEOPLE WITHIN THE CITY OF BERKLEY THAT WROTE THE VERY FIRST TO SEE THAT STEP WAS THE FIFTY CENT RECYCLING GOAL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE WHOLE U. S. ACTUALLY WAS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO. AND OF COURSE AT THAT POINT AND ARE SUBSEQUENTLY CALIFORNIA WITH A. B. NINE THIRTY NINE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE SEC SUCH A GOAL AND THEN IS SINCE HAS SAID EVEN HIGHER NOW OVER THAT TIME PERIOD IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES THERE WERE STILL LOTS OF FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT TOOK THE MATERIALS THAT WE PUT IN A RECYCLING BIN AND REPRODUCE THEM INTO ANOTHER PRODUCT. THAT AND SO WELL CERTAINLY WE SOLD A LOT OF OUR MATERIALS TO OTHER COUNTRIES. THERE WAS STILL A BIG MARKET HERE. THAT MARKET IS PRETTY MUCH GONE. SO WE'RE NOW ALMOST ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON SELLING PRIMARILY TO ASIA BUT ASIA HAS NOW TOLD US CHINA SPECIFICALLY INDIA OTHERS. THEY DON'T WANT THAT STUFF ANYMORE THEY'RE PRODUCING ENOUGH OF OUR OWN. SO WHAT WE ARE FACING IN CALIFORNIA AND IF YOU TALK TO EVERY HOLLER EVERY LOCAL GOVERNMENT EVERY RECYCLER WE ARE FACING A CRISIS. NOW THIS BILL. BY INCLUDING. GLASS CONTAINERS IN R. C. R. V. IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP IT IS NOT THE ONLY THAT WILL SOLVE THIS CRISIS BUT IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT ONE TO HELP US AND GIVE US THE TOOLS NUMBER ONE GLASS IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST. QUALITY MATERIALS TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE INTO ANOTHER PRODUCT. SECONDLY IT IS OUR WINE AND LIQUOR THAT ARE DOMINANTLY NOW IN GLASS MANY OF THE OTHER BEVERAGES THAT USED TO BE IN GLASS OR NO LONGER. HOWEVER ONE IN LIQUOR STILL TENDS TO BE IN GLASS. NOW WHAT WE HAVE GOOD QUOTE UNQUOTE RECYCLING RATES OF WINE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT MEANS 70% THAT MEANS WE HAVE GOOD RATES OF PEOPLE PUTTING THE WINE BOTTLE IN THE BLUE BIN. THAT'S GOOD BUT BECAUSE IT IS NOT IN OUR BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM IN OUR C. R. V. PROGRAM WE ARE NOT COLLECTING THE FUNDS THAT HELP US HE FOR THE REST OF RECYCLING RECYCLING IS NOT JUST PICKING UP A PRODUCT AND SO THE BENEFIT OF THE CHANGES THAT THIS BILL IS ADVOCATING AND WOULD PUT INTO PLACE IS THAT IT WOULD HELP GIVE US ADDITIONAL TOOLS TO ADDRESS THESE MARKET FAILURES WERE EXPERIENCING NOW. HOPEFULLY TO INCENTIVIZE MORE PRODUCERS IN COUNTRY IN IN STATE OF GLASS. SECONDARY CLASS. END GIVE US SOME OF THE FUNDING TO DO THAT. AS WELL AS- INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF REDEMPTION FACILITIES THROUGH TO THE FINDING AND THE FLEXIBILITY THAT THE BILL INCLUDES SO WITH THAT I DRIVE VOTE. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SAYING NINE CENTER AYE COKIE MAY CONCLUDE. I THINK THE INSULTS TO THE BODY MADAM PRESIDENT NOW WITH- REQUEST AN AYE VOTE SO WE CAN CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION ON THE VERY IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL MATTER FACING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE WORLD.

SENATE BILL FIFTY BY SENATOR WIENER AN ACT RELATING TO HOUSING SENATOR READER THE FLOOR IS YOURS I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT BACH COLLEAGUES TODAY AFTER TWO YEARS OF PROCESS- IN THIS BODY SENATE BILL FIFTY IS BEFORE US. SB FIFTY IS A THOUGHTFUL MEANINGFUL. AND SERIOUS AFTER TO CHIP AWAY AND ULTIMATELY TO HELP SOLVE. CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS OUR HOUSING SHORTAGE. SB FIFTY IS THE PRODUCT OF TWO YEARS OF DELIBERATION AT THE COMMITTEE LEVEL IN THIS BODY. PLUS MASSIVE STAKEHOLDER OUT REACHES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. SB FIFTY IMPACT CONTAINS MANY PROVISIONS RESULTING DIRECTLY FROM NOT STAKEHOLDER OUT REACH. THIS BILL ALTHOUGH IT'S TEHNICAL IN MANY WAYS ABOUT ZONING AND DENSITY AND HIGHLY AND SO FORTH. FUNDAMENTALLY THIS BILL AND OUR HOUSING WORK IN GENERAL IS IN TALKS ABOUT THE TECHNICAL TERMS IT IS ABOUT REAL PEOPLE AND THE REAL PAIN THAT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE SUFFERING RIGHT NOW THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. THE REAL PAIN OF CHILDREN WHO GO AWAY TO COLLEGE AND CAN'T MOVE BACK HOME TO THE COMMUNITY WHERE THEY GREW UP BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY THAT THEY CAN AFFORD LESTER GOING TO LIVE IN THEIR PARENTS BASEMENT. THE REAL PAIN OF THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS OUR NEIGHBORS WHO ARE LIVING IN THEIR CAR OR A VAN AND GETTING UP TO WORK EVERY DAY AND TAKE THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL AND GOING TO SLEEP IN A CAR OR IN A HOMELESS SHELTER WORKOUTS SURFING. THE REAL PAIN OF FAMILIES WHO ARE FORCED TO LEAVE THEIR COMMUNITY OR LEAVE THE STATE ENTIRELY BECAUSE THEY CANNOT ENVISION A FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES IN TERMS OF HAVING HOUSING. WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA WE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD ARE BROKEN STATUS QUO. IT WILL TAKE MANY DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO SOLVE THIS TERRIBLE CRISIS WE'VE HAD IN SOME AMAZING WORK IN THIS BODY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND I APPLAUD THAT. BUT OUR WORK IS NOT DONE. SENATE BILL FIFTY ADDRESSES ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL MATHEMATICAL LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY AS A STATE TO HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING FOR EVERYONE WHO NEEDS A- RESTRICTIVE. EXCLUSIONARY ZONING THAT PREVENTS THE CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. HENCE THE DESTRUCTIVE CONSTRUCTION OF APARTMENT BUILDINGS IN THE LARGE MAJORITY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ZONING IS SORT OF BORING BUT IT'S FOUNDATIONAL IT IS A MATH EQUATION IT SETS A BASELINE ABOUT HOW MUCH HOUSING IS LEGAL TO BUILD. YOU CAN HAVE THE MOST STREAMLINED PROCESS IN THE WORLD YOU CAN HAVE ENORMOUS FIVE OF FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT IF THE ZONING SAYS YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO BUILD SOMETHING. THAT THE END OF THE PROCESS. RESTRICTIVE ZONING PUTS A HARD CAP FULL STOP WHEN OUR ABILITY TO BUILD ENOUGH HOUSING TO GET OUT OF THIS CRISIS. RESTRICTIVE ZONING ALSO LEADS TO SPRAWL. BROUGHT BECAUSE IF YOU CAN'T BUILD WHERE THE JOBS IN THE TRANSIT ARE YOU JUST GOING TO BUILD FURTHER AND FURTHER OUT. IT DESTROYS FARM LANDS AND OPEN SPACE. IT CLOGS ARE FREEWAYS TO THE POINT WHERE THEY BECOME INCAPACITATED. IT PUSHES OUR% NEIGHBORS INTO MULTI HOUR COMMUTES WHERE PEOPLE ARE SPENDING THREE OR FOUR OR MORE HOURS A DAY. ON THE ROAD IT INCREASES CARBON EMISSIONS AND MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE. FOR US TO BE OUR CAR OUR CLIMATE GOALS. WE'RE CURRENTLYFALLING BEHIND ON OUR CLIMATE GOALS IN CALIFORNIA. PRECISELY BECAUSE WE ARE PUSHING PEOPLE INTO THE SUPER COMMUTES BECAUSE WE DON'T BUILD ENOUGH HOUSING WHERE THE JOBS ARE. RESTRICTED TWENTY INCH IS THAT HOW. IS PERPETUALLY EXPENSIVE AND OUT OF REACH FOR MOST CALIFORNIANS. SB FIFTY WILL HELP CALIFORNIA CLOSE ITS MASS THAT MASSIVE HOUSING DEFICIT AND DO SO IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T CREATE SPRAWL THAT IS SUSTAINABLE. SO HOW DO WE GET TO THIS POINT WHERE WE HAVE A MULTI MILLION HOME DEFICIT AND WE ARE BASICALLY BOTTOM OF THE BARREL AMONG THE FIFTY STATES IN OUR HOUSING SUPPLY. IT DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN RANDOMLY IT HAPPENED BECAUSE OF DELIBERATE ANTI HOUSING POLICY CHOICES THE CALIFORNIA AND OUR CITIES HAVE MADE OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS WE HAVE SYSTEMATICALLY DE PRIORITIZE HOUSING. AND WE HAD A AT IN IN IN A FACT A POLICY IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS NOT A PRIORITY TO HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING FOR EVERYONE WHO NEEDS A- WE'VE MADE A CHOICE. THAT THE WAY A NEIGHBORHOOD LOOKS. THAT VIEWS ARE MORE IMPORTANT TO WHOSE ACTUALLY ABLE THEN WHO'S ACTUALLY ABLE TO LIVE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD. NOW FOR THE FIRST HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS CALIFORNIA EXISTED WE DIDN'T DO IT THIS WAY WE LET PEOPLE BUILD APARTMENT BUILDINGS ALL OVER THE PLACE AND THAT'S WHY WE BUILT SO MUCH HOUSING IN THE FIFTIES AND THE SIXTIES SEVENTIES FORTIES WHEN WE WERE GROWING BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS. WE SAID BUILD SINGLE FAMILY HOMES BUT ALSO BUILD APARTMENT BUILDINGS AND SO WE KEPT UP WITH POPULATION GROWTH WE USED TO BUILD AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT MORE HOUSING THAN WE DO TODAY WHEN WE WERE SMALLER STATE BECAUSE WE DID IT THE OLD FASHIONED WAY. WE BILL ENOUGH HOUSING TO ACCOMMODATE OUR GROWTH. AND THEN WE STOP DOING THAT IN THE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES SAN FRANCISCO DOWN ZONES. AND ELIMINATED THE ABILITY TO HAVE APARTMENT BUILDINGS AND 70% OF THE CITY LA DID IN THE EIGHTIES. AND 75% OF THE CITY. AND WE SYSTEMATICALLY DECIDED WE'RE NO LONGER GOING TO ALLOW ENOUGH HOUSING FOR THE PEOPLE THAT DID IT. OTHER CITIES AND SUBURBS QUICKLY FOLLOWED SUIT. THIS HAS HAD PROFOUND CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR ECONOMY FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT. FOR PEOPLE'S QUALITY OF LIFE AND FOR THE DIVERSITY OF OUR COMMUNITIES IT HAS PUT A FUNDAMENTAL IMPEDIMENT. IN CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO BE A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN COME HERE AND MAKE LIVES FOR THEMSELVES. WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE CAN BE A PART OF OUR COMMUNITY AND HAVE HOPE THAT THEY WILL HAVE A FUTURE. AND THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE AS A STATE THAT IS CREATIVE AND DIVERSE AND INNOVATIVE DOT IS A THREAT BECAUSE WE HAVE DE PRIORITIZE HOUSIN. SO SIGNIFICANTLY SB FIFTY ALL IT DOES IS READ LEGAL OFFICE. APARTMENT BUILDING SMALL TO MID SIZE APARTMENT BUILDINGS IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT REALLY LIES IS ON AND MANY OF THE PLACES. WHERE THEY WERE LEGAL FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY YEARS BEFORE WE BEGAN ON. THIS IS NOTHING NEW WE'RE JUST SAYING LET'S GO BACK TO THE ERA WHEN WE ACTUALLY WERE BUILDING A HOUSING FOR PEOPLE. NOW I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT SB FIT DOES WHAT IT DOSN'T DO. THERE'S BEEN AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF HYPERBOLE ABOUT THIS BILL I HAVE NO PROBLEM DEFENDING ANY BILL THAT I'M OFFERING I DO HAVE A PROBLEM WHEN PEOPLE PUT OUT INFORMATION THAT DRAMATICALLY EXAGGERATES OR SPREADS AND ACCURATE INFORMATION. THERE ARE MAILERS GOING INTO ALMOST ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS RIGHT NOW. THAT CONTAIN BALD FACED LIES ABOUT THIS BILL. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KNOW WHAT THE FACTS ARE. THERE'S BEEN TALK THAT THIS IS GOING TO LEAD THE HIGH RISES AND SKYSCRAPERS. IN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT IS NOT TRUE. THIS BILL OVERWHELMINGLY DIFFERS TO LOCAL HIGHER LIMITS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE GEOGRAPHY COVERED BY THIS BILL INCLUDING IN LA INCLUDING IN THE BAY AREA IS SUBJECT TO THE LOCALLY ADOPTED HI LIMIT SO IF YOU HAVE A THIRTY FOOT HEIGHT LIMIT. IN A CITY INSTEAD OF SAYING OKAY THIRTY FEET BUT ONLY SINGLE FAMILY NOW IT'S THIRTY P. BUT YOU CAN PUT A MULTI UNIT BUILDING THERE. THE BILL DOESN'T CHANGE THE SIZE OF BUILDINGS WILL BE CALL SETBACKS THE BALK THE WITH THE AND THE LENGTH OF THE BILL. LOCAL RULES FILLED. IT IS THAT THIS LEADS US GUYS ARE RISE WHICH WE'VE HEARD IT'S JUST NOT ACCURATE. THERE IS ALSO A NARRATIVE THAT SB FIFTY ENDS LOCAL CONTROL OF LAND USE THAT IS ALSO INACCURATE- AS I MENTIONED LOCAL HEIGHT LIMITS AND BALK STANDARD FOR BUILDINGS WILL STILL APPLY LOCAL DESIGN STANDARDS WILL STILL APPLY. STILL EVERY ABILITY TO RESTRICT BAND DEMOLITIONS OF BUILDINGS LOCAL APPROVAL PROCESS LOCAL IMPACT FEES AND SO ON AND SO FORTH CITIES WILL STILL GET TO SET THOSE CITIES WILL HAVE ENORMOUS FLEXIBILITY IN TWO WEEKS AGO OR THREE WEEKS AGO WE I'D IN ADDITION SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. THAT GIVE CITIES THE ABILITY TO CRAFT THEIR OWN ALTERNATIVE PLAN TO SB FIFTY THAT TED IS TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF THOSE CITIES. WE ARE CURRENTLY AS WE SPEAK WORKING WITH THE LEAGUE OF CITIES ARE NOT PROVISION TO FLUSH IT OUT EVEN MORE AND MAKE SURE IT IS IT'S EASY TO USE AS POSSIBLE FOR THE CITIES I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH OUR CITIES. AND WITH THE LEAGUE OF CITIES IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE I DON'T FOR SUPPORTING OR OPPOSING THIS BILL I WILL WORK WITH YOU WE ARE WE ARE MY ARM OUT AS I DO THE LEADERS. WHATEVER OUR DISAGREEMENTS AS A PARTNER IN MAKING SURE THAT THE STRONG LOCAL CONTROL PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL ARE IS IMPLEMENTABLE AS POSSIBLE. SO THERE ALSO SOME. WHICH I SHARE AN A VERY SAN TO. ABOUT GINGER. AND DISPLACEMENT. SB FIFTY IS ABOUT ADDING NEW HOUSING SO THAT MORE PEOPLE CAN HAVE HOUSING. IT'S AN ADDED A BILL. IT IS NOT ABOUT REPLACING EXISTING COMMUNITIES WE'VE DONE THAT BEFORE. THE STATE IN THE PAST WITH REDEVELOPMENT WHEN ENTIRE COMMUNITIES WERE BULLDOZED IN VICE CITY AND OTHER CITIES AND THAT IS WRONG. AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE PUT THE STRONGEST TENET AND ANTI DEMOLITION PROTECTIONS IN THIS BILL IN EXISTENCE UNDER STATE LAW. PROTECTIONS THAT ARE STRONGER THAN THOSE IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE WORK THROUGH THOSE WITH ADVOCATES WHO ADVOCATE FOR LOW INCOME RENTERS AND I AM PROUD OF THOSE PROTECTIONS. IF YOU IF THERE'S BEEN A RENTER LIVING ON THE PROPERTY AT ANY POINT IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS. YOU CANNOT GET A DEMOLITION PERMIT FOR AN SB FIFTY PROJECT EVEN IF THE WHOLE CITY WOULD OTHERWISE GRANTED TO YOU. IF THERE'S BEEN AN ALLIS ACTED ACTION ANY POINT IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS. YOU CAN'T GET A DEMOLITION PERMIT FOR THE BUILDING EVEN IF THE CITY WOULD GIVE IT TO YOU. WE HAVE AN AFFORDABILITY PROVISION IN THIS BILL RANGING FROM 15% TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. I WANT TO STRESS WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK ON A OF BILLET I SPOKE TO THE- WE ARE IN. TO GO TENS WITH BROAD. WIDE HOUSING EQUITY CALL. AND WILL CAN. TO WORK WITH THEM AND WE ARE I BELIEVE VERY CLOSE TO AN AGREEMENT. ON A BILL PROUD OF THAT WORK. IMPLEMENTATION THE BILL IS DELAY. FOR FIVE. AND WHAT WE CALL SO. TO COMMUNITIES OUT THE- LOW INCOME. AND AT RISK OF DISPLACEMENT TO GIVE THOSE COMMUNITIES MORE TIME- THE PLAN. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH GROUPS LIKE ACT LA AND PUBLIC COUNCIL IN PUBLIC ADVOCATE. AND POLICY LINK AND SO FORTH. TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS BILL. IS AS EQUITABLE AS POSSIBLE THAT IS MY GOAL. WE'RE NOT ALL THE WAY THERE YEAH. ON THIS BILL BUT WE WILL GET THERE AND I'M A 100% COMMITTED TO CONTINUE BROAD ENGAGEMENT. WE HAVE ALSO TAKEN MANY MANY. AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL. AS WE'VE GONE TO THIS TO YOUR PROCESS I HAVE HAD AN OPEN DOOR. WITH AGAIN CRITICS SUPPORTERS AND EVERYONE IN BETWEEN I HAVE TRAVELED TO VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STATE. TO MEET WITH AND SPEAK WITH LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS NEIGHBORS AND TAKE THAT INPUT. AND I WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT. AS THIS MOVES TO THE ASSEMBLY AND COLLEAGUES I AM ASKING YOU TO GIVE ME AND OUR COALITION THAT OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS BILL AND THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. AND TO MAKE IT AS GREAT. AS IT CAN BE. YOU KNOW I RESPECTED THEIR MEMBERS OF THIS BODY WHO DON'T SUPPORT THIS BILL. I RESPECT THAT THIS IS A DEMOCRACY AND WE ALL IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE WE KNOW FROM THE VOTERS THAT THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE OR NUMBER TWO ISSUE ALONG WITH HOMELESS. I VOTERS ONE UP ACT. THEY WANT US TO TAKE. BOLD ACTION THEY WANT US TO STOP THE PAIN. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO DO THAT THIS ISN'T A SILVER BULLET THERE ARE MANY OTHER THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO. BUT THIS IS A BIG STEP AND IT WILL SEND A PROFOUNDLY POWERFUL MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE IS THERE ARE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES GET IT AND THAT WE INTEND TO TRY TO MOVE THE DIAL. TO MAKE THE SITUATION BETTER. SB FFTY IS AN OVERNIGHT SOLUTION. THIS IS GOING TO IT'S THICKNESS FIFTY YEARS TO DIG INTO THIS WHOLE IT'S GOING TO TAKE THIS TIME TO DIG OUT. BUT SB FIFTY WILL HELP PLANT THE SEEDS SO THAT IN THE FUTURE OUR KIDS AND OUR GRANDKIDS DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME PAIN. THAT PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING TODAY COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL. MADAM PRO TEM. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I'M ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE ON SB FIFTY. AND I VOTE TODAY MEANS WE KEEP DISCUSSIONS GOING ON HOW CALIFORNIA CAN REACH SB FIFTIES GOAL OF BUILDING MORE AFFORDABLE HOMES AFFORDABLE% HOMES IT WILL ALSO INCREASE ACCESS TO JOBS REDUCE THE TIME PEOPLE HAVE TO SPEND IN THEIR CARS. AND HELP ME CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE CHANGE TARGETS. TO THE SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCING SB FIFTY AND FOR YOUR HER BROKE EFFORTS TO GET THE BILL WHERE IT IS TODAY. AS YOU KNOW I ASK FOR THE BILL TO COME TO THE FLOOR HOPING THAT THERE HAD BEEN ENOUGH ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS WILL ALLOW THE BILL TO MOVE FORWARD. THE DEBATE WE ARE ABOUT TO HAVE WILL SHOW WHETHER OR NOT THEY GOAL HAS BEEN ACHIEVED. I KNOW THAT MANY SENATORS AND MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE REPRESENT HAVE REAL CONCERNS ABOUT SB FIFTY. AND LET ME ASSURE YOU THAT I HEAR YOU AND I ACKNOWLEDGE THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE BILL A BILL OF THIS MAGNITUDE. IF THE BILL IS SUCCESSFUL TODAY THERE MUST BE GOOD FAITH EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS AND I THINK THE AUTHOR HAS HEARD THAT. IS SB FIFTY ARE PERFECT I THINK AS YOU'VE HEARD I KNOW I KNOW THAT SEVERAL OF YOU HAVE IDEAS FOR IMPROVEMENT AND YOU'VE SHARED THOSE COMMENTS. I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS IDEAS. I URGE AN AYE VOTE TODAY BECAUSE THAT PROVIDES THE TIME WE NEED FOR THOSE IDEAS AND POTENTIALLY OTHERS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE MIX. SB FIFTY IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST PROFILE BILLS- PROFILE BILLS WE HAVE CONSIDERED IN THE SENATE. IT IS ALSO ONE WHERE THERE'S BEEN TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE OF OPINION BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF OUR RESPECTIVE CAUCUSES AT WE KNOW THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. BUT WEIGHING ALL THATCAREFULLY I WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE FOR SB FIFTY TODAY AND FOR EVEN MORE WORK ON THE BILL TO START IMMEDIATELY THANK YOU. SENATOR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM PRESIDENT SIR AS OTHERS HAVE SAID THE AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE THE SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO DESERVES A GREAT DEAL OF CREDIT FROM ALL OF US. ALL OF US. FOR TAKING ON SUCH A CRITICAL ISSUE. FOR TAKING ON THE BIG STUFF AND FORCING US TO ASK THE BIG QUESTIONS. AND I ALSO THANK THE PRO TEM. OR THE MANNER IN WHICH SHE HAS COMPORTED THIS OPEN AND INCLUSIVE DISCUSSION. FOR ALL OF US. AS SET FORTH. IN THE LÏNG FLEA FINDINGS IN THIS BILL. AND IT'S ALL OF US KNOW HEREON THE FLOOR TODAY FROM OUR OWN COMMUNITIES. THERE ARE COMPELLING REASONS WHY WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS DEEP AND URGENT CRISIS. A CRISIS FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS FOR FAMILIES STRUGGLING TO KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS. AND FOR NEIGHBORHOODS UNRAVELED IN THE FACE OF DESPERATION REAL PEOPLE REAL IMPACTS ON THEIR LIVES AND THEIR HOPES AND THEIR DREAMS AND THEIR OPPORTUNITIES. BUT THE THESIS OF MY COMMENTS TODAY ON THIS FLOOR. COMES DOWN TO THIS GETTING IT RIGHT IS JUST AS URGENT GETTING IT RIGHT IS JUST AS URGENT TOO OFTEN. ALL OF US BID ARE CONSUMED BY THE IMMEDIATE ISSUE AT HAND AND WE BIND OURSELVES TO THE UNFORGIVING LAW OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. WELL I HAVE BEEN DOING A GREAT DEAL OF THINKING ON THIS ISSUE TYPICALLY RELATING TO AFFORDABILITY I WILL LIMIT MY COMMENTS TODAY THE THREE IMPORTANT POINTS. FIRST THE PREMISE OF THIS BILL IS THAT MAYORS AND CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS OF SOME OF OUR FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO CITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE STANDING IN THE WAY OF HOMEBUILDING AT THE BEHEST OF SINGLE FAMILY. HOMEOWNERS WELL THERE MAY BE SOME MERIT TO THIS NOTION IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS SWEEPING GENERALIZATION BOTH IT OVER SIMPLIFIES THE PROBLEM. AN UNNECESSARILY DEMEANS PEOPLE WHO WITH NOTHING DONE NOTHING MORE THAN MAKE HOMES FOR THEMSELVES RAISE A FAMILY AND PLAY BY THE RULES. AND NOW THIS MEASURE AND I JUST TALKED TO THE CITY TO CONFIRM THIS SEEKS TO IMPOSE NEW RULES FOR NEIGHBORHOODS IN NEARLY 80% OF LOS ANGELES. WE HAVE GIVEN THERE'S A CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS A FALSE CHOICE ON THE ONE HAND WE SAID HOUSING ELEMENTS SET HOUSING GOALS AND YET ON THE OTHER HANDAS THEY WORK TO PROVIDE POLICE FIRE AND OTHER IT'S ESSENTIAL SERVICES TO RESIDENTS. THEY HAVE BEEN CASH STARVED THE ONLY AVENUE AVAILABLE IN PRINCIPLE IS THE BRADLEY BURNS UNIFORM SALES TAX WHICH ALLOCATES ONE CENT FOR EACH DOLLAR OF SALES TO CITIES. THE REAL BUT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WHICH TO GIVE A CITIES A REASON TO SAY YES TO AUTO MALLS YES THE BIG BOX RETAIL STORES WHICH WOULD ADD CITY FUNDING BUT SAY NO TO HOUSING THE FISCAL IS ATION OF LAND USE WHICH WOULD INCREASE COSTS OF PROVIDING SERVICES. THAT IS THE SIMPLE SPEECH BIGGEST REASON WE ARE WHERE WE ARE. SECOND THE GOVERNOR IN ALL OF US IN THIS CHAMBER. WANT TO BUILD HOUSING URGENCY URGENTLY THAT IS CLEAR. WE NEED TO START BUILDING THIS AFTERNOON IF YOU ASK FOLKS THAT WE REPRESENT. BUT THIS BILL WILL NOT TAKE EFFECT UNTIL JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE ABOUT A YEAR FROM NOW. AND THE AMENDMENTS TICKET JUST THREE WEEKS AGO THE LADY SP FIFTIES MAJOR PROVISIONS FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE START OF THE GOVERNOR SECOND TERM. THAT'S THREE YEARS OF WAITING. NOT REALLY ADDRESSING THE URGENT PROBLEMS GETTING HOMES BUILT. EVEN BEFORE CONSIDERING DELAYS BASED UPON THE VERY REAL PROSPECT OF LITIGATION. SO WHAT HAPPENS IN THE MEANTIME. WHAT HAPPENS IN THE REAL WORLD. FIVE A DEVELOPER CONTEMPLATING A PROJECT THIS BILL REGRETTABLY AND IRONICALLY HIS ME HUGE INCENTIVE NOT BUILD NOW BUT THIS MY HANDS FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS WHY BILL TWO STORIES WOULD YOU CAN BILL FIVE STORIES LATER. AND IN LOS ANGELES YOU COULD NOT PICK A WORSE TIME TO INADVERTENTLY POUR SAND IN THE GEARS. WITH VOTER APPROVAL LOS ANGELES HAS INCREASED INCENTIVES FOR BUILDING AFFORDABLE I UNDERLINE AFFORDABLE HOUSING YOUR TRANSIT. NEARLY TWENTY THOUSAND UNITS JUST IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. AND WATER SINGLE FAMILY HOMEOWNERS DOING CONTRARY TO THE NOTION THAT THEY ARE CAUSING THE PROBLEM MANY ARE AT A RING ADDING A SESTRI DWELLING UNITS AN IDEA CARRIED INTO LAW MY SEAT MATE FROM FREMONT. MY ABSENCES MADE FROM FREMONT. IN LOS ANGELES SINCE THE EIGHTY LAW WAS PASSED WE HAVE HAD ONE FOURTEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY APPLICATIONS FILED JUST TWO YEARS ALMOST TEN THOUSAND ALREADY PERMITS ALREADY ISSUED AND MOST OF THEM ARE IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. WHEN THE COMMUNITY YOU CLAIM. SOUGHT A TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLAR GRANT AS PART OF A GREEN TRANSFORMATIVE. COMMUNITIES PROGRAM FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES UNDER THE STRATEGICAL COUNSEL YOU DON'T THEY DID THEIR ENTIRE HOUSING PLANFOR CLEAN AND GREEN COMMUNITIES WAS BASED ON EIGHTY USE NOT BUILDING NEW STUFF BUT EIGHTY USE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN. SO WILDLY SUCCESSFUL. THIRD IN THE PAST I KNOW THE ARGUMENT IS BEEN MADE HERE ON THE FLOOR BUT I WANT TO STAND IN THE COUNTRY POSITION I HAVE STOOD ON THIS FLOOR. AND HUMBLY ASK MY COLLEAGUES MANY OF YOU. FOR THE COURTESY TO MOVE A MEASURE THAT WAS NOT FULLY DEVELOPED TO THE OTHER HOUSE AS A WORK IN PROGRESS. A NUMBER OF US HAVE DONE SO OURSELVES. BUT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THIS TIME WE'RE IN A DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES. AS I MENTIONED EVEN IN THE BEST CIRCUMSTANCES ARKHAM STANCES SB FIFTY DOES NOT BECOME LAW UNTIL JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE ARE STILL IN THE OPENING DAYS OF THIS YEAR. THIS BILL MAKES SWEEPING CHANGES TO HUGE SWATHS OF THE STATE. THERE IS NO REASON IN MY JUDGMENT THE POINT. APPS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE IS THE PRO TEM SAID THAT WE FACE TO THE OTHER HOUSE DENYING OURSELVES AN OPPORTUNITY TO COLLECTIVELY DO THE WORK AND EFFECTIVELY AND URGENTLY ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. LET'S DO THE HOMEWORK TOGETHER LET'S BUILD ON THE EXTRAORDINARY HOMEWORK THAT THE AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE HAS DONE IN ALL CORNERS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND BETTER UNDERSTAND THE INTER GENERATIONAL CHALLENGES THAT INFORMS MUCH OF THE FRAMEWORK OF MEASURE. LET'S GET IT RIGHT TOGETHER LET'S CRAFT A SOLUTION TOGETHER THAT SOLVES EXTRAORDINARY HOUSING CHALLENGES WE FACE. I INCLUDE WHERE I STARTED GETTING IT RIGHT IS JUST AS URGENT AND FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS YOUR TODAY. BUT I PLEDGE EACH ONE OF YOU THE PRO TEM THAT I WILL WORK AS HARD AS I CAN ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA TO GET IT RIGHT TO WORK ON THIS BIG PICTURE PACKAGE TO FIGURE IT OUT TO PUT IN THE POSITION. WHERE AS- DOWN PROBABLY UP BEFORE THE CAN. WHERE THAT WE'RE NOT JUST GOING TO CHANGE THEIR OWNING. AND CHANGE THEIR COMPLIANCE DETRIMENT ALONG ON THE LINE WAS THAT HAVE BEEN AND WILL INCREASE A TRANSIT ORIENTED PROGRAM THAT WILL FOR CAP. AND GET DONE. VERY MUCH IMPRESSED. SENATE HUESO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND OF PRESS THEN AND SENATOR. UP YOU KNOW I I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN CREATING HOW MY DE FOR MANY YEARS AND I'VE BEEN- RESPONSIBLE FOR SEVERAL THOUSAND UNITS IN MY DISTRICT SOME THAT ARE VERY PROUD OF THAT HAVE INTRODUCED A VERY HIGH QUALITY AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN MY DISTRICT. AND THAT TOOK SOME WORK IN THAT TOOK SOME EFFORT. AND RIGHT NOW THAT WE HAVE A HOUSING. BLOOM WHERE WE HAVE A RENT PRICES HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER. AND WHEN I SEE THE PEOPLE MY DISTRICT SUFFERING THROUGH THESE EXORBITANT RENT. PRICES THAT THAT ARE JUST UNBELIEVABLE I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO LIVE IN OUR STATE. I CAN'T EXPLAIN WHY WE DON'T HAVE A GREATER SUPPLY OF APARTMENTS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. AND AS I'VE GONE TO INVESTORS ASKING THEM WHY ARE YOU BUILDING MORE. I MEAN WITH RENT PRICES AT THIS RATE. WHY ARE YOU BUILDING MORE AND THE PRIMARY RESPONSE FROM THEM IS WHERE. WHERE CAN WE BUILD WHERE DOES OWNING ALLOW US TO. BUILD UNITS THAT WE CAN- TURN A PROFIT IN EVEN EVEN AT THESE EXORBITANT RENT RATES AND THAT'S THAT'S CONCERNING. YOU KNOW- I'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN IN IN THIS MAN FOR MANY YEARS. AND SEEING A BILL LIKE THIS SINCE YOU KNOW HOW THIS BILL IS GOING TO AFFECT MY DISTRICT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THIS IS THIS IS. THIS BILL FOLLOW SOME VERY BASIC PRINCIPLES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SMART GROWTH. INTRODUCING HOUSING WHERE YOU HAVE MASS TRANSIT THAT MAKES AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF SENSE. I LOOKED AT THIS BILL IT JUST MAKES A- A NORMS NONSENSE TO ME AS PEOPLE SAY IT THIS IS GOOD ELIMINATE RESIDENTIAL ZONING AND I LOOK AT THE ZONING. THAT'S CLOSE TO. TO A MASS TRANSIT WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE CLOSE TREND I'M HOPING AS FOR AS FAR AS MY OCCUR COMING. CAN ONE OF THE REASONS SEVEN MAINLY GOT ME OUT TO RUN FOR OFFICE. WAS AN EXPERIENCE THAT I HAD IN MY COMMUNITY AND MAYBE YOU'VE HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE. THE COMMUNITY THAT I LIVE IN SOUTHEAST SAN DIEGO HAD A COMMUNITY PLAN THAT WAS UPDATED IN NINETEEN. EIGHTY SEVEN. ANY RESPONSE TO HIGH CRIME RATES- THE LEADERS OF THE CITY AT THAT TIME DECIDED TO DOWN ZONE. SO A LOT OF RESIDENTIAL ZONING THAT WAS THAT ALLOWED SIX UNITS. WAS DOWN ZONE TO TWO UNITS NOT TALK ABOUT MOVIE IN. THE MOVING THE GOAL POST DURING THE COMPETITION. HERE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT PAID A PREMIUM FOR. THE RESIDENTIAL LEASE ON LAND THAT WAS THAT ALLOWED SIX UNITS. AND IT WAS DOWNS OF THE TWO UNITS THAT'S LIKE TAKING MONEY OUT OF PEOPLE'S POCKETS AND WHAT IT REALLY RESULTED IN HIS BLOOD OF PEOPLE NOT TEARING DOWN OF UNITS WHERE THEY HAD FOUR UNITS ALREADY BECAUSE THEY COULD ONLY BE REBUILT TWO UNITS AND IF THEY HAD SIX UNITS SO WE'VE HAD A LOT OF- UNITS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. THE AMERICAN REPLACE I CAN'T REPLACE A DOES MAKE FINANCIAL SENSE REPLACE AND SO WE HAVE A LOT OF THE UPDATED UNITS THAT PEOPLE. WANT TO REINVENT AND BECAUSE THEY CAN REBUILD. AND I THINK I THE REASON I'M I'M- RAISING THIS IS AN ISSUE BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY HAD. THAT SAME EXPERIENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED IN THOSE YEARS IN THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SINCE THEN. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DOWN ZONING THAT'S OCCURRED SINCE THEN. SO IF YOU CONSIDER THAT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN. THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA WAS TWENTY EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE. AND TODAY WE HAVE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN IN THAT PERIOD WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF A DOWN ZONING TAKE PLACE. IF YOU IF YOU KNOW MATH IT'S A VERY SIMPLE ISSUE THIS IS AN ISSUE OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND IF WE'VE LOWERED. THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE THAT SUPPLY WE ONLY HAVE DEMAND INCREASING. AND NO ABILITY. TO PROBLEM THIS BILL DOESN'T GET TO THE PRIMARY ISSUE WHAT IT'S GOING TO HELP IT'S GOING TO HELP IS IT GONNA DESTROY RESIDENTIAL ZONING AS SOME CLAIM NO IS IT GONNA GO AS FAR AS SOME PEOPLE FEAR IT MIGHT ABSOLUTELY NOT BUT WILL IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE ABSOLUTELY YES. IT WILL. AND I THINK TALK IS CHEAP AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN HERE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE WE'VE MADE SOME GAINS. WE'VE MADE SOME GAINS WE HAVE FUNDED OF SOME FOR HOUSING BUT AS FAR IS REALLY ADDRESSING THE SUPPLY ISSUE WE HAVE NOT DONE THAT. AND AS OUR GOVERNOR COMES IN MAKING SOME PROMISES TO BUILD SEVERAL MILLION UNITS. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE GONNA DO THAT UNDER THE CURRENT SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA THIS BILL WILL AT LEAST PROVIDE SOME ABILITY TO DELIVER ON THAT PROMISE IT'LL PROVIDE SOME ABILITY OF THIS LEGISLATURE. TO PRO PROVIDE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE CAN CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT SUPPLEMENT TEAM THAT WITH WITH MORE FUNDING. AND SUPPORT FOR THE LOCAL CITIES TO DO THAT BUT THE POLITICAL WILL- THAT'S NOT EXIST AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS NOT ENOUGH TO CHANGE WHAT THE NUMBERS ON THE SUPPLIES SO. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS MEASURE. AND TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING. THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THIS IN THE LEGISLATURE AND LET'S KEEP THIS BILL ALIVE SO WE CAN DO THAT THANK YOU MEMBERS. SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. REGULAR HERE THROUGHOUT THIS DEBATE. A FAIR AMOUNT OF UNITY ON ON ONE FACT THAT WE ARE IN A CRISIS ONE OF HOMELESSNESS ONE A HOUSING IN THE STATE. AND I WOULD ADD A THIRD WHICH IS THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY. NOW SOME OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY. HAVE SPOKEN UP IN FAVOR THIS MEASURE AS I HAVE THROUGHOUT MY CAREER IN FACT THAT WE NEED MORE HOUSING NEAR TRANSIT TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT PEOPLE DRIVE SO WE CAN REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PATROL AND WE USE THAT WE CAN REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF POLLUTION IN THE STATE. AND I AGREE WITH THAT PREMISE I ALSO AGREE THAT WE DO NEED TO BUILD MORE. BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE. THAT IN ORDER TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF THOSE CRISES. THAT WE HAVE TO CREATE NEW ONES. AND. YOU CAN ONLY LOOK BACK TO LAST FALL. AND THROUGHOUT THESE LAST YEAR'S. WHERE WILDFIRES HAVE TORN THROUGH. NOT THE HINTERLANDS. BUT A NEW CLASS OF NEIGHBORHOOD. EXTENDING DEEPER INTO OUR COMMUNITIES AND EVER BEFORE. THEY CALL THIS THE WE- THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AND THOSE OF YOU WHO HAD PEOPLE LOSE HOMES OR LOSE THEIR LIVES NO THESE AREAS NOW ALL TOO WELL. THEY LOOK BEAUTIFUL. AND THEY'RE ALSO DEADLY. AND IT'S TIME WE STOP DEVELOPING AS A STATE INTO THE WILD IN URBAN INTERFACE PERIOD. THERE IS NO LAW ON THE BOOKS RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT LIMITS THAT HUNGER FOR GROWTH INTO THOSE REGIONS. AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING IS BURNING MORE AND MORE CALIFORNIANS HOMES DOWN THE MORE WE BUILT IN THERE. IN TURN RED TAX OUR INSURANCE SYSTEM. WHERE TO PUT A DRAIN ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND ULTIMATELY AS THE RECEIVERS UP HERE WE'RE GONNA END UP FOOTING THE BILL FOR TAXPAYERS IN CALIFORNIA. SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE A DEBATE ABOUT HOUSING TODAY. SO I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT ONE EXAMPLE. WHEN THE WALLS THE FIRE TORE THROUGH THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT THE PEOPLE I WORK FOR. BURNED A LOT OF PEOPLE I KNOWS HOMES DOWN BURN MY PLACE DOWN. BURN A LOT OF MY FRIENDS DOWN. I CAN GET BACK ON MY FEET THOUGH. I GOT A FAMILY THAT. I CAN GO CRASH ON THEIR COUCH IN. GOT EDUCATION AND A GOOD JOB HERE. AND CAN COULD PULL MYSELF BACK UP A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IN CITIES ALL THROUGHOUT THAT REGION HIT BY THAT FIRE AND SO MANY OTHER FIRES. IS UNDER EVEN CURRENT LAW THEY'RE BEING FORCED TO PLAN NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS MULTI FAMILY PROJECTS IN THAT SAME REA THE JUST BURNED DOWN LITERALLY IN THE ASHES OF THE WALLS THE FIRE I HAVE CITIES THAT ARE TRYING TO NOW TO MEET STATE LAW BUILD FURTHER IN THAT AREA. THAT SEEMS INCREDIBLY BACKWARDS TO ME. AND I WOULD NOTE THAT THE AUTHOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO AND I HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS ISSUE. ENDS. I BELIEVE THE SENSITIVE TO IT. I DON'T IMPUGN ANY INTENT HERE. BUT THOSE OF YOU TO TELL YOU THAT THE BILL EXAMS HI FIRE SEVERITY ZONES FOR MANY THIS UP ZONING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY. IS MISREADING THE TEXT. AND I'LL QUOTE HERE FOR A MOMENT. FROM THE BILL SO IN SIX IN SECTION SIX FIVE NINE ONE EIGHT DOT TWO TWO THOSE ARE YOU READING ALONG. THE TOP OF PAGE FORTY SIX. WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY SAYS THAT IF YOU'RE IN A VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONE. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE IMPACTED BY THE OF ZONING REQUIRED. UNLESS YOU ADOPTED A MITIGATION MEASURE QUOTE UNQUOTE A MITIGATION MEASURE. EVERY SINGLE CITY I WORK FOR HAS ADOPTED SOME KIND OF MITIGATION MEASURE. THERE FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE CITIES IS STILL IN. AND THEY'RE STILL SUBJECT TO THE OF ZONING IN THIS BILL. YOU CALL AN EXEMPTION WELL THE EXEMPTION OF THE EXEMPTION HAS HOLES YOU COULD DRIVE A TRUCK THROUGH. NOW I KNOW THE AUTHORS EXPRESSED INTEREST IN TRYING TO CLOSE SOME OF THOSE LOOPHOLES. AND THAT'S PART OF THIS SORT OF WORK IN PROGRESS VERSUS TRY TO GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME CONVERSATION WE'RE GONNA HAVE TODAY. BUT THIS VOTE IS TO SERIOUS. TO JUST TRUST IN THE PROCESS AND LET IT GO. YOU KNOW WE ALL HAVE TO GO HOME AND BE TRUE TO OUR OUR FOLKS. BUT I CAN'T IN GOOD CONSCIENCE SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. KNOWING THAT. I'M MAKING THE PROBLEM WORSE. NOW THERE HAVE BEEN EXEMPTIONS GRANTED IN THIS LEGISLATION TO BE CLEAR. THOSE COMMUNITIES MAY NOT HAVE BEEN EXEMPTED BUT CERTAINLY COMMUNITIES LIVING IN COUNTIES UNDER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND HAVE. NOW TO THOSE COUNTIES THE STILLER SUBJECT TO SUM UP ZONING RESTRICT SOME UP ZONING REQUIREMENTS NEAR- KEY TRANSIT HUBS. SO THERE WILL STILL BE SOME MODEST UP ZONING IN THOSE SMALLER COUNTIES IF THEY'VE GOT A TRAIN LINE GOING THROUGH. BUT I DON'T CARE THE MALIBU IS OUT OF THIS BILL. I GREW UP THERE I LOVE THAT COMMUNITY BUT- THEY'RE NOT THE FOLKS THAT. I'M TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY IN AND FRANKLY IF MALIBU AND MARINE ARE OUT. OR SAN LUIS OBISPO IS OUT BUT SAN JOAQUIN IS IN AYE AYE I DON'T GET THE WHY THERE. THE SANTA BARBARA IS OUT BUT VENTURA COUNTY IS IN I DON'T GET THE WHY. THOMAS FIRE TORE THROUGH THAT AREA. DOESN'T MATTER THEY DOING NORTH SIDE OF-THE COUNTY THEIR OWN ALWAYS. TORE THROUGH THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS JUST THE SAME WHY DIFFERENT TREATMENT. SO I STRUGGLE WITH THAT. THE DISPARATE TREATMENT WHEN IT COMES TO. THESE EXEMPTIONS WE BUILT INTO THIS LEGISLATION AND PART OF ME ONCE THEY WILL GET MY EXEMPTION I WANT TO GET THOSE OTHER CITIES OUT I WANT TO CUT THAT DEAL HELP ME GET AGORA HILLS OUT HELP ME GET WESLAKE OUT IN CALABASAS IN LET ME CUT THAT DEAL SAVE THE FOLKS BACK HOME FROM THIS FEAR OF MORE FIRE. AND THEN ALL OF DONE MY JOB. BUT I CAN'T IN GOOD CONSCIENCE MAKE THIS A BILL ABOUT. DEALS AND EXEMPTIONS I TRULY BELIEVE IN THE PURPOSE OF THE AUTHORS PUTTING FORTH HERE THAT WE ACTUALLY DO NEED. A HOUSING SOLUTION IN THE STATE. THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ALL THESE RISKS BUT- DOESN'T MAKE THE PROBLEM WORSE. I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE. AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THE BILL MAKES IT OUT OF THIS HOUSE TODAY YES IT COULD CHANGE. BUT WE DO NOT HAVE TO EXACERBATE THE CLIMATE CRISIS WHILE WE TRY TO SOLVE IT. THAT IS A FALSE CHOICE. I BELIEVE WE CAN GET THIS RIGHT. THE PUSH FOR GENEROSITY. NOT TO EMPOWER NAME BE ISM. BUT TO SAY YES IN THE RIGHT BACKYARDS THE LAND HAS TO DICTATE THE USE. AND WHEN THE LAND IS TOO DANGEROUS WE HAVE GOT TO SAY NO. AND WHEN THE COMMUNITY IS RIGHT WE DO HAVE TO SAY YES SO I AM. READY TO SAY YES BUT- WE'VE BEEN THROUGH TOO MUCH TRAUMA. TO FORCE THIS ON THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN TORN DOWN. AT ALL THE COSTS THAT COME WITH IT HUMAN FISCAL AN OTHERWISE. SO I REGRETFULLY RISE IN OPPOSITION IS MEASURE AND- SHE ATE ALL THE HARD WORK DONE SO FAR. CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS HOW TO RETURN TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS OF MY OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO. I'M A NOT A HUGE FAN OF SUPPLY SIDE ECONOMICS IDEA ACTUALLY LIKE TO REGULATE MARKETS ESPECIALLY TO PROTECT CONSUMERS RENTERS PEOPLE YOU NAME IT BUT SUPPLY SIDE ECONOMICS ISRAEL AND AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO POINTED OUT WE HAVE A SHORTAGE. WE HAVE A SERIOUS HOUSING SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT HOUSING SHORTAGE WHILE ALONE IS NOT THE SOLE CAUSE OF OUR VERY HIGH COST OF HOUSING IT IS. I WOULD ONE WANT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL I DON'T WANT TO DIMINISH IT IT IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE- NOW. IT GETS A SIMPLIFIED IN DIFFERENT AREAS ANY GETS AMPLIFIED IN OUR HIGH JOB GROWTH AREAS. AND THOSE SAME HIGH JOB GROWTH AREAS THAT HAVE NOT BUILT TO HOUSING ARE THOSE AREAS WERE NOT ONLY IS THE HOUSING MOST EXPENSIVE BUT WHERE WE ARE SEEING THE MOST GENTRIFICATION. AND DISPLACEMENT. AND WHILE SUPPLY ALONE WILL NOT STOP THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL TO STOP IT IT MUST BE THE SUPPLY MUST BE ADDED TO STOP IT. NOW LET'S LOOK AT SOME REAL FAX THE ONLY PLACES IN THE U. S. WITH HIGH JOB GROWTH THAT HAVE ALSO SEEN HOUSING COSTS GO DOWN BOTH RENT AND HOMEOWNERSHIP ARE THOSE AREAS WHERE THE HOUSING SUPPLY INCREASED DRAMATICALLY. BUT WE'RE NOT THAT PLACE WE ARE NOT THAT PLACE WE HAVE NOT INCREASED OUR HOUSING SUPPLY DRAMATICALLY AND AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO POINTED OUT IF ANYTHING I DON'T MEAN ANYTHING WAS JUST HE SAID IT IT'S REAL. EVERYWHERE ACROSS OUR STATE. WE DOWN ZONED AND THAT'S SPEND FOR FORTY YEARS WE DOWN SOON. ENACT DOWN ZONING RESULTED IN EXCLUSIVE NEIGHBORHOODS IT RESULTED IN THE SITUATION WHERE. THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS WITH THE BEST SCHOOLS THE BEST PARKS THE BEST AMENITIES. FEWER AND FEWER PEOPLE CAN LIVE NOW THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER REASONS THAT EXCLUSION HAPPENED LET'S NOT FOOL OURSELVES MUCH OF THAT DOWN ZONING STARTED AFTER THE FAIR HOUSING ACT. WENT INTO PLACE. AND SO YOU KNOW MUCH OF OUR ZONING LAWS WERE OUT RATE IN EXPLICITLY RACIST NOW. EVEN WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE CONFRONTED THAT WE HAVE CHANGE SOME POLICIES BUT WE HAVE NOT CHANGED OUR CITY POLICIES. CAN'T WE ARE NOT ONLY THE SHORTAGE THE HOUSING SHORTAGE WE STILL HAVE THE EXTREME EXCLUSIVITY. WE HAVE NOT DONE ENOUGH YET BUT WE HAVE DONE A LOT AS A LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNED INTO LAW MANY PROTECTIONS FOR. ESPECIALLY OUR TENANTS LAST YEAR'S BILL THAT PUT IN THE HOUSING THE RENTAL CAP LAST YEAR'S BILL THAT. HAD JUST BECAUSE EVICTION PROTECTIONS ACROSS THE STATE ARE THE INCREASE WE FUNDED FOR LEGAL SERVICES SO THOSE PEOPLE THAT WERE FACED WITH. I'M JUSTIFICATIONS OR UNFAIR OR WRONG RENT INCREASES ROY RAINY CREASES THAT DIDN'T COMPLY WITH THE LAW WOULD HAVE SOME ABILITY TO GET SOME LEGAL ASSISTANCE WE'VE ALSO DONE A LITTLE MORE PROTECTIONS AROUND PEOPLE FOR WHO MAY FACE FORECLOSURE. OR WHO MAY BE FACING ON FAIR LENDING PRACTICES NOT ENOUGH NOT ENOUGH WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE THERE BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO DO MORE FOR SUPPLY. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES NOW BY THE VIRTUE OF NOT HAVING ADEQUATE SUPPLY NOT ONLY HAVE WE SEEN THIS COSTS GOING UP BUT WE'VE SEEN THAT PEOPLE ARE DRIVEN OUT. TO FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM THE JOB AREAS AND VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IN THIS STATE REACHED AN ALL TIME HIGH IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THERE'S ONLY GROWING WE DON'T HVE THE NUMBERS YET FOR TWENTY NINETEEN BUT THE TREND IS OCT. KNOW WHAT IS AB ME. WE ALREADY HAVE THE DIRTIEST AIR IN THE COUNTRY. VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED INCREASING THIRTIES ARE AIR FURTHER IT JUST EXACERBATES ARE HEALTH PROBLEMS AND OF COURSE THE CLIMATE CRISIS. NOW EIGHTY USED ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND I SUPPORTED EVERY EIGHTY YOU A LOT AND EVEN CARRIED THE ONE THAT THEN GOT PASSED LAST YEAR UNDERTAKINGS NAME THAT WAS ORIGINALLY MY BILL. BUT EIGHTY USE AS IMPORTANT AS THEY ARE FOR THE SUPPLY AND I'M NEVER GONNA SPEAK AGAINST THEM THEY ARE CREATING HOUSING FOR OUR FAMILIES BY AND LARGE THE UNITS ARE TOO SMALL WE NEED FAMILY HOUSING ALSO. SO WE NEED MORE THAN JUST EIGHTY USE EIGHTY YEARS ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT WHAT SB FIFTY DOES IS IT INCREASES THE HOUSING OPPORTUNITY IN HIGH JOB GROWTH AREAS AND TRANSIT RICH AREAS. AREAS THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAVE GREAT PARKS GREAT SCHOOLS AND GREAT AMENITIES. YEAH AND IT REQUIRES MORE BUILDING OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAN ANY OF OUR CURRENT LAWS DO SO YES THERE'S LEGITIMATE CONCERN THAT PERHAPS THE UNITS THAT ARE UNDER SB FIFTY THE BUILDINGS THAT ARE TEN UNITS OR LESS. DON'T HAVE QUITE THE LEVEL OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING REQUIREMENTS THAT THE ONES ABOVE TEN UNITS HAVE. THAT CAN BE ADDED BUT IT DOES FOR IT FREE AND ANY BUILDING OF ELEVEN UNITS AND HIGHER IT REQUIRES MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAN ANY OTHER LAW WE HAVE. IT ALSO. IF I CAN ADDRESS THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE HIGH FIRES AREAS YOU KNOW EVERY LOUIS IS NOT EXCLUDED IN THE BILL BUT WHAT MY COLLEAGUE WHO IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE HOUSING IN THE HIGH FIRE AREAS HAS FAILED TO MENTION IS THAT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE AN INCREASE IN DENSITY AND HIGH FIRES AREAS BECAUSE IT ALLOWS EACH LOCAL GOVERNMENT FLEXIBILITY AS TO WHERE IF THEY CHOOSE NOT TO PUT THE INCREASE DENSITY. IN WHERE THE BILL IS DESIGNED THEY CAN ADJUST THAT IT GIVES FLEXIBILITY TO THE TO THE NEW BILL THE AMENDMENTS IN THE BILL BEFORE YOU AND YOU CAN READ IT GIVE FLEXIBILITY TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NOW WHAT I'D FURTHER SAY IS THAT I WOULD SUPPORT A BILL. AND I HOPE THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM THAT WAS YOU FIRE AREA WOULD PUT INTO PLACE A BILL THAT WOULD PUT A MORATORIUM. ON THE BUILDING IN THE MOST SEVERE HIGH RISK FIRE AREAS BUT I WOULD STILL NEED TO YOU. THAT YOU WILL FIND THE VERY SAME OPPOSITION THE ENTIRE LEAGUE OF CITIES WOULD OPPOSE SUCH A BILL. AND EVERY ALMOST EVERY ENTITY THAT NOW POSES FIFTY WOULD OPPOSE SUCH A BILL. SO I THINK IT'S UNFAIR TO CONFLATE THIS BILL WITH INCREASING FIRE RISK. BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY THINGS IN THE BILL THAT GIVE THE FLEXIBILITY AND THERE'S ADDITIONALLY THE POWER OF ALL OF US TO ADDRESS THE HIGH FIRE AREAS. MAYBE IN THIS BILL AS IT MOVES ON OR A SEPARATE BILL BUT YOU WATCH THAT WILL BE SO CONTROVERSIAL. SO I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO CONFLATE THAT. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE MOVE FORWARD WITH INCREASING SUPPLY. AND I'M DOING SOME OF THAT EXCLUSIONARY ZONING THAT HAS BEEN PUT INTO PLACE OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS THAT IS PREVENTED US FROM GETTING MORE FOR HOUSING AND MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THOSE AREAS WHERE EVERYONE MOST WANTS TO LIVE THOSE AREAS WITH THE HIGH QUALITY SCHOOLS AND THE HIGH QUALITY PARKS. AND ALL THE OTHER AMENITIES AND WITH THAT I ASKED FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. SENATOR BILL. OUR PRESIDENT TO A MEMBERS. I HAVE A QUALIFIED YES VOTE ON THIS BILL. AND I'M VOTING FOR TODAY BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT MOVE FORWARD. BUT I RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE MY VOTE. WHEN IT COMES BACK TO THE CENTER FROM THE ASSEMBLY AS WE KNOW AND I'VE BEEN HERE FOR THIRTEEN YEARS SOMETIMES BILLS GO TO THE ASSEMBLY THERE CONTROVERSIAL THEY COME BACK AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW. WHAT THEY SAY ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY'RE- OFTEN CHANGE IN A RADICAL WAY I ALSO WANT TO HEAR FROM THE GOVERNOR. GOVERNOR IS GOT A BUDGET HE'S GONNA BE WORKING ON AND I'M CURIOUS AS TO. WHAT HIS POLICY DIRECTIVES ARE ON THAT. NOW SB FIFTY MAY INCREASE HOUSING PRODUCTION BUT WILL NOT ADDRESS ARE HOMELESS CRISIS. STREAMLINING THE BUILDING PERMIT PROCESS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR DEVELOPERS WILL GENERATE MORE HOUSING UNITS. BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE UNITS WILL BE MARKET RATE. CITIES LIKE MY SAN JOSE AND LOS ANGELES DESPITE BEST INTENTIONS ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP WITH THE EVER GROWING PRODUCTION NEEDS TO KEEP THE RENT BURDEN AND A VERY LOW INCOME FAMILIES OFF OUR STREETS. THE MARKET RATE HOUSING IS PART OF THE SOLUTION. BUT WITHOUT DELIBERATE INVESTMENTS IN AFFORDABLE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR OUR POOREST THOSE WITH THE MOST SEVERE NEEDS IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE RISING COST OF RANTS AS PROPERTY VALUES INCREASE ESPECIALLY ALONG TRANSIT QUARTERS AND THAT'S WHY THE STATE NEEDS TO INVEST IN ONGOING FUNDS TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ESPECIALLY FOR A POOREST FAMILIES THOSE MAKING 30% AREA MEDIAN INCOME OR LOWER. THESE FAMILIES ARE IN THE HOMELESS PIPELINE NOW DEVOID OF ANY STATE SUBSIDY THERE IS NO INCENTIVE TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE PROJECT SIMPLY WON'T CANCEL OUT AND- YOU COULD JUST BASICALLY AUS ANY DEVELOPER. AND THEY'LL SAY THAT. ALL THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS WE HAVE MADE HISTORICAL ONE TIME- INVESTMENTS TO SHELTER THOSE ON OUR CITY STREETS AND PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT PLANNING FUNDS TO GET LOCAL GOVERNMENT INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR HOUSING ELEMENTS BUT AS YOU KNOW THE CRISIS IS SIGNIFICANT. AND DOORS WHAT CAN BE DONE IN ONE YEAR OR OR IN ONE BILL. FURTHER ALL RE RESET REPORTS INDICATE HOUSING PRODUCTION IS SLOWING AND WE'RE FALLING EVEN FURTHER BEHIND. WHAT IS BEEN MISSING FROM THE SASSER EFFORTS IS THE ONGOING STATE COMMITMENT TO QUICKLY BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS TO KEEP UP WITH DEMAND. OF I'M PUTTING MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH IS IN THAT MONDAY WE ANNOUNCED THAT STE OUR OFFICE BUILDING WHERE MY OFFICES IN SAN JOSE. WE'RE PROPOSING THAT THAT BE TORN DOWN TO BUILD TWELVE HIGH UP TO TWELVE HUNDRED UNITS OF FACULTY AND STUDENT HOUSING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR OUR STUDENTS IT SOUNDS A STATE AND OUR FAQ OUR LOW INCOME FACULTY AND STAFF AT THE UNIVERSITY. THERE ARE TWO POINT TWO MILLION EXTREME LOW INCOME AND VERY LOW INCOME RENTER HOUSEHOLDS COMPETING FORCE ONLY SIX HUNDRED FIX SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND AFFORDABLE RENTAL RENTAL HOMES AND THIS LEAVES ONE POINT FIVE MILLION OF CALIFORNIA'S LOW INCOME FAMILIES. WITHOUT ACCESS TO HOUSING. AT A HIGH RISK OF HOMELESSNESS. ANDWE NEED A PACKAGE OF LEGISLATION THAT ADDRESSES BOTH THE SHORT. AND LONG TERM GOALS. WE DID THIS TWO YEARS AGO IT WORK WE GOT A LOT OF GOOD LEGISLATION PASSED WE CAN DO IT AGAIN. AND WE NEED TO BE SMARTER MORE STRATEGIC ABOUT OUR INVESTMENTS THAT ARE HOUSING POLICIES THE CITY STATE PARTNERSHIP FOR PRODUCTION. MUST BE PART OF THE SOLUTION NOW IT PASSED SB FIFTY CREATES A PERMANENT PROGRAM. THAT WILL HELP DEVELOPERS BUILD THE MARKET RATE HOUSING AND SOME AFFORDABLE UNITS YEAH- THE JANUARY BUDGET WE JUST SEEN CONTINUES TO MAKE TEMPORARY NON COMMITTAL INVESTMENTS CREATING UP. OUR NEW PROGRAMS FUNDED WITH ONE ONE THEY CREATE NEW PROGRAMS. ANNOUNCING THESE PROGRAMS BUT THE ONLY FUNDING FOR ONE YEAR. AT THAT IS ILLOGICAL AND WE NEED TO MAKES SURE OUR POOREST FAMILIES AREN'T PUSHED OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS THEY GREW UP IN THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE THIS TO CREATE THE ON GOING STATE FUNDING SOURCE TO SPUR PRODUCTONS OF THE AFFORDABLE UNITS SO I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL TODAY WITH THE CABBIE OUT. THAT WE DON'T LEAVE BEHIND. THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WITHOUT A HOME AND THOSE THAT ARE ONLY A FEW STEPS AWAY. FROM THAT HAPPENED TO THEM. ARJUNA VOTE LET'S KEEP WORKING TOGETHER. WE GOT A LONG ROAD AHEAD OF US THIS YEAR THANK YOU. SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS- I WANT TO THANK. ALL THE COLLEAGUES IN THE AUTHOR FOR THE- CIVIL AND RESPECTFUL CONVERSATION HERE THE UNDERPINNING IS A HOUSING CRISIS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT HOUSING CRISIS IS LINKED TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS. IN MY DISTRICT I'VE HEARD IN LARGELY IN THE LAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS FROM CITIES FROM ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS FROM TENANTS RIGHTS GROUPS. AND THEIR SPLIT AND THEY'RE DIVIDED AS THEIR PERSPECTIVES VERY AND DIFFER ON HOW THEY THINK. SB FIFTY MAY IMPACT THEM THEY'RE COMMUNITY THEIR ORGANIZATIONAL INTEREST. A COUPLE OF FACTS THAT ARE IRREFUTABLE IN MY DISTRICT. IS THAT WE HAVE JOBS. WHERE WORK FORCE CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE. AND SO EVERY DAY IN MY DISTRICT WE SEE A MIGRATION OF VEHICLES MOVING FROM EAST TO WEST. AND THEN WE SEE THAT IN THE AFTERNOON GOING THE REVERSE DIRECTION SOME PEOPLE COMMUTING FOR AN HOUR SOME FOR TWO HOURS SOME FOR THREE HOURS. AND THE REASON THEY'RE SPENDING THAT MUCH TIME IN THEIR CARS IS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD HOUSING IT'S CLOSE TO WHERE THEY WORK. THOSE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. ARE THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR. TO DIRTY AIR INTO THE CLIMATE CRISIS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SB FIFTY OFFERS A PATH FOR US TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS I UNDERSTAND IT'S LINKAGE TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS. IN THE VOTE TODAY FRIENDS. A VOTE TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD TO FURTHER COMMITTEE HEARINGS IN THE ASSEMBLY FURTHER AMENDMENTS AND IF SUCCESSFUL IN THE ASSEMBLY IT COMES BACK TO US. SO ARE VOTE TODAY IS NOT A VOTE ON A FINAL BILL THAT IS GOING TO BIND OUR COMMUNITIES IT'S GOING TO BIND OUR CONSTITUENTS. OUR YES VOTE TODAY IS A VOTE SAYING YES THE HOUSING CRISIS IS REAL YES THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS REAL AND WE'RE COMMITTING AS A BODY TO USE THIS VEHICLE AS ONE OF MANY. TO MOVE THIS CONVERSATION FORWARD THE BENEFIT OF THIS BILL ALREADY. IS THE DISENGAGED OUR COMMUNITIES IT'S ENGAGED INTEREST GROUPS IT'S ENGAGE NON PROFITS AND BUILDERS AND TRADES. IN HAVING PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONVERSATION IN OUR COMMUNITIES THE CITIES ARE REPRESENT WHEN I MEET WITH THEM THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IS HOUSING. AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. SO FRIENDS. I DON'T AGREE WITH THOSE WHO SAY WE SHOULDN'T SUPPORT A BILL THAT IS NOT PERFECT OR RIGHT OR THAT WE'VE IRONED OUT ALL THE CONCERNS WHEN IT'S A BILL IN PROGRESS GOING THROUGH OUR PROCESS I ALSO RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CAST A NO VOTE IF IT COMES BACK IN HASN'T ADDRESS SOME OF THE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. WHEN IT COMES BACK I STAND CORRECTED. BUT FRIENDS LET'S NOT CUT THIS CONVERSATION SHORT. LET'S NOT OBLIGATION AND RESPONSIBILITY TO MOVE THIS CONVERSATION FORWARD TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE CONCERTS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED AND UNDERSTAND AND I RESPECT THE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE IN IMPACT IN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES BUT FRIENDS THERE ARE THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN RECALCITRANT. IN STEPPING UP TO DO THEIR PART. TO SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS IN THIS BILL IF NOTHING ELSE SENDS A MESSAGE TO THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE AND WE'RE ALL GOING TO HAVE TO STEP UP. TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS NO COMMUNITY SHOULD BE EXEMPT FRIENDS I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. CENTER DRAWS A- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I TOO WANTED OUR EXPRESS PUBLICLY MY APPRECIATION FOR THE EFFORTS BY SENATOR- WIENER FOR ALL OF HIS VERY VERY HARD WORK BUT I WANT TO EXPRESS MY CONCERNS WTH SB FIFTY. ON AFFORDABILITY TEN IN PROTECTIONS AND EXEMPTIONS. I WANT TO SAY THAT. THE FIRST THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HAS BEEN. WORKING VERY VERY HARD IN HOUSING DEVELOPMENT THE CITY HAS TO PASS THE GOAL OF BUILDING AT LEAST A HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWO YEARS EARLY. NOT ENOUGH. NOT ENOUGH THAT TOOK A LOT OF WORK. AND YET AS AS BE FIFTY IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN COUNTIES WITH A POPULATION OF SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND OR LESS WOULD BE EXEMPTED FROM THE SAME RULES WITHOUT HAVING SHOWN HARD WORK TO GET WHERE WE NEED TO GET. THAT MEANS THAT FORTY THREE OUT OF FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES WILL BE EXEMPTED FROM THE SAME REQUIREMENTS AS OTHERS. NOW I RECOGNIZE. THE EFFORT TO CREATE A PROCESS FOR EXEMPTIONS YET WELL ANGELENOS DEDICATE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESOURCES TO HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. AND OTHERS DO NOT HAVE TO LIVE UP TO THE SAME STANDARDS I UNDERSTAND THE SUPPLY SIDE OF HOUSING PRODUCTION IS IMPORTANT WE'VE GOT TO DO IT. BUT THEN I SAY WHAT ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. LOS ANGELES IS COMMITTED TO BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEAR TRANSIT THE PROOF LIES IN A DECADE OF ADVOCACY AND HARD WORK AND COMPROMISE THIS LED TO NOVEMBER TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN VOTERS APPROVED MEASURE J. J. J. WHICH CREATED THE TRANSIT ORIENTED COMMUNITIES PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM INVOLVED IN INCLUDES SKILLED LABOR STANDARDS LOCAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND ENSURING THAT HOUSING DEVELOPMENT BRINGS ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO OUR COMMUNITIES THE TLC PROGRAM HAS PROPOSED APPROXIMATELY SEVENTEEN THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS. ALMOST FOUR THOUSAND OF THESE UNITS WILL BE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ACCORDING TO A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION STUDY SB FIFTY WOULD ADD TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED HOUSING UNITS INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY TEN. ON SITE AFFORDABLE UNITS IN THE CITY ABOUT LATE. SB FIFTY IT WOULD ONLY ADD TEN NET NEW ON SITE AFFORDABLE UNITS. WE ALSO APPROVED A ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR BOND FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND HOUSING FOR HOMELESS SB FIFTY WILL DISRUPT OUR DECADE LONG PROCESS OF BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEAR TRANSIT IN LA. CAN I PROTECTIONS ARE A TOP PRIORITY FOR ME AND I KNOW FOR MANY OF YOU. 77% OF RESIDENTS IN MY DISTRICT ARE RENTERS. THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF ANY DISTRICT IN THE STATE. LAST YEAR I PROPOSED SB FIVE TWENTY NINE WHICH WOULD HAVE PROTECTED AND STRENGTHENED TENANT ASSOCIATIONS AND REQUIRED EVICTIONS FOR JUST BECAUSE- RICK A JUST CAUSE REDUCTIONS. SB FIVE TWENTY NINE GOT TWENTY BOATS AND DID NOT GO TO THE ASSEMBLY THIS FIGHT ISN'T OVER ALONG SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES WE ARE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE ADVOCATING FOR REAL TEN AND PROTECTIONS. AND THERE ARE POINT DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN ANTI DEMOLITION PROTECTIONS AND TENANT PROTECTION. SB FIFTY SETS ANTI DEMOLITION PROTECTIONS. BUT DO NOT ADDRESS PRE VACATIONS AND THE VACATIONS UNDER THESE PROTECTIONS THE BUILDING MIGHT BE PRESERVED FOR A FEW MORE YEARS BUT EVICTIONS ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR. TEN IN PROTECTIONS FOCUSED ON KEEPING FAMILIES IN THEIR HOMES FOR GENERATIONS. IN ADDITION TO MY BILL THERE ARE OTHER MODELS PRETENDING PROTECTIONS SUCH AS PROVIDING THE LEGAL ASSISTANCE AND RELOCATION ASSISTANCE TO RENTERS AND STREAMLINING THE PROCESS PRETENDING COMPLAINT CASES. LASTLY IN ORDER TO ENFORCE THE ANTI DEMOLITION PROTECTIONS IN SB FIFTY THE STATE NEEDS TO CREATE A RENTAL REGISTRY. LAST YEAR ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS INTRODUCED AB SEVEN TWO FOUR WHICH WOULD DO JUST THAT. THIS BILL WAS HELD IN COMMITTEE. SO EXCEPT FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOOSE BILL ALL TEN THE PROTECTION BILLS FAILED LAST YEAR STRONG TENDED PROTECTIONS ARE ESSENTIAL TO ADDRESSING THE HOUSING CRISIS WORLD TALKING ABOUT. IT IS MY HOPE THAT WE ALL WORK HARDER TO SHARE THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND PROTECTING TENANTS. TO ME WE ARE NOT CLOSE IN THIS BILL. I WILL MANY TIMES FOR BILLS THAT NEED IMPROVEMENT. BUT THE THREE FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS I'VE TALKED ABOUT HAVE NOT BEEN RESOLVED. AND IF THIS BILL IS NOT THE ANSWER. TO THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT LET'S NOT PRETEND WE ARE ADDRESSING ALL OF THE ISSUES WITH CALL IT WHAT IT IS IT'S A MARKET MARKET HOUSING PRODUCTION BILL THANK YOU. SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT AND I WANT TO STAND ON IN SUPPORT OF A NUMBER OF THE ISSUES AND CONCERNS RAISED BY MY FELLOW COLLEAGUES FELLOW ANGELINOS. I WANT TO STOP AND THINK THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL. FOR DOING A YEOMAN'S JOB- OF TALKING TO ALL OF US MANY OF US NUMEROUS TIMES FOR COMING TO VISIT OUR DISTRICTS UPON INVITATION HE VISITED THE EIGHTH COUNCIL DISTRICT- IN MY SENATE DISTRICT AND SAT IN THE HOME. OF HOMEOWNERS OUT CONSTITUENTS TO REALLY HEAR FIRSTHAND THEIR CONCERNS AND SO I THINK YOU. I ALSO WANT TO THANK COMMUNITIES NO NOT JUST OUR LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS OR INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS BUT COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO. ORGANIZE THEMSELVES AND EDUCATE THEMSELVES AND READ THE- I THINK FOR AMENDED VERSIONS OF THIS BILL THE THREE AMENDED VERSIONS OF ITS PREDECESSOR- AND WHO ARE PAID TO DO THIS WORK. BUT GALVANIZED NEIGHBORS TO REALLY TALK AND EDUCATE THEMSELVES AND EDUCATE US ABOUT THE IMPACT THEY FEAR SUPPORT SB FIFTY WOULD HAVE ON THEIR COMMUNITY. FIVE I DON'T WANT TO BE REPETITIVE. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF ISSUES THAT I HAVE NOT HEARD RAISING THE FLOOR THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW HOUSING POLICY IS NOT NEAR CLEAN HOUSING POLICY. HAS BEEN PLAGUED BY. RACIST HISTORIC POLICIES. AND SELL THE INTERSECTION OF RACE AND CLASS HAS A MAJOR IMPACT ON HOUSING POLICY IN THE STATE AND WE CANNOT DENY THAT NOR CAN WE OVER SIMPLIFY OUR CONVERSATION ABOUT WE NEED HOUSING I WORK FOR AN ORGANIZATION THAT- HAD A- MONSTER THAT HARD WORK IS EASY WORK NOT DONE A PROPER TIME LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT ACROSS THE STATE HAVE FAILED ALL OF US IN OUR RESIDENTS IN TERMS OF NOT DOING THE PROPER WORK RIGHT TIME IN TERMS BEEN AGGRESSIVE IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE WE BUILD ADEQUATE HOUSING FOR ALL ACROSS THE SOCIO ECONOMIC SPECTRUM. I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE IN MY DISTRICT SPECIFICALLY SOUTH LA. SINGLE FAMILY HOMES DO DOMINATE THE LANDSCAPE AND ARE IN DIRECT CLOSE PROXIMITY TO MAJOR TRANSIT ZONES THAT'S THE REALITY OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE THIRTY TH DISTRICT. I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO REMIT RECOGNIZE THAT SINGLE FAMILY HOMEOWNERS ARE NOT A MONOLITHIC GROUP. THAT SAME COMMUNITY WAS ALSO RAVAGED BY THE HOUSING CRASH PRICES AND HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO RED LINING AND PAID FOR A HIGHER INTEREST RATES FOR MORTGAGES IF THEY CAN GET THEM. AND SO WE HAVE SINGLE FAMILY HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE HOLDING ON. BY THEIR FINGERNAILS IN TERMS OF KEEPING THOSE HOUSES AND SO AS WE DO TALK ABOUT COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE DOMINATED A DISPROPORTIONATE BURKE ENTERS. SOME OF US REPRESENT COMMUNITIES TO. DO HAVE HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE HOLDING ON BY THE SKIN OF THEIR TEETH. WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THE DIFFERENCE THE DIVERSITY OF THE HOUSING. MARKET AND THOSE WHO ARE IN IT. FOR ME THE CORE ISSUE AS WE DEBATE THE HOUSING CRISIS BECAUSE WE ARE IN ONE. IS CAN BE SUMMED UP IN ONE SENTENCE WHO HAS THE PRIVILEGE OF LIVING WHERE. AND AS WE DO CONFLATE ISSUES BECAUSE A WHOLE LOT OF CONFLATION OF GOING ON WITH REGARD TO SB FIFTY. THE ISSUE OF GENTRIFICATION COMES OUT RESOUNDINGLY IN MY COMMUNITY. AND THE ISSUE OF GENTRIFICATION IS SYNONYMOUS WITH THE YEAR. EIGHT CORE FEAR ABOUT CAN I AFFORD TO CONTINUE TO LIVE IN MY COMMUNITY. WE'LL DEVELOPERS AND SPECULATORS BY UP THE PROPERTY AROUND ME AND MAKE MY COMMUNITY LOOK AND FEEL DIFFERENT. WHO WILL BE MY NEW NEIGHBORS. FEAR AROUND ALL OF THOSE CORE ISSUES. AND SO WE CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOUSING POLICY ABSENT THE REALITY OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE FEELING IN THEIR OWN TOWNS AND NEIGHBORHOODS. YOU KNOW I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE- THANK YOU MISSED AUTHOR. UP PRETTY CONSISTENTLY FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS NOW WE DID A CALCULATION THIS MORNING IN MY OFFICE AND WE'VE BEEN INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IT EITHER MYSELF OR STAFF IT LITERALLY A DOZEN CONVENIENCE. ENGAGING THOUSANDS PLURAL OF RESIDENTS OF THE THIRTY SENATE-DISTRICT THE TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE. AND I PUSH BACK CARD I SAID IF NOT SB FIFTY IF YOU SAY NOT SB FIFTY WOULD YOU SAY YES TO. AND I HAVE TO GIVE MY CONSTITUENTS CREDIT BECAUSE THEY STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE. AND WE HAVE LISTS AND CHARTS- OF IDEAS MOST OF WHICH I HAVE SHARED WITH THE AUTHOR SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN BILLS THAT WE'VE PASSING CLEAN SB THREE THIRTY WHICH I DID VOTE FOR. I WAS HESITANT AND RIDICULE FOR IT FOR NOT MAKING A PUBLIC STATEMENT A WHERE I'D BE WITH THE BILL A YEAR AGO. AND I DIDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. AND SO I DIDN'T GO PUBLIC AGAIN NOT DIRECTLY TO THE MEDIA BUT TO AT MY COMMUNITY AT TOWN HALL THIS WEEK ABOUT MY POSITION BECAUSE I COULD THEN OPINE ON THE FINAL VERSION OF THE BILL THAT I KNEW WE WOULD BE VOTING ON TODAY. AND SO THIS IS A PROCESS I GET THAT. BUT AGAIN I HAVE TO CONCUR WITH MANY OF THE ISSUES RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT WHY THIS IS IT. RIGHT FOR THE RESIDENTS OF MY DISTRICT AT THIS TIME. WE MUST CONTINUE TO HAVE A BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE DIG OURSELVES OUT OF THE HOUSING CRISIS WERE IN. ZONING IS ONE KEY ISSUE RECOGNIZING THE HISTORICAL ROLES ONLY HAS PLAYED IN KEEPING CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY OUT OF CERTAIN COMMUNITIES. AND I APPRECIATE THAT THERE ARE MANY CITIES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY WERE ELIMINATING- EXCLUSIONARY ZONING FOR THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED. BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION IN A BROADER CONTEXT WITH MULTIPLE OPTIONS TO HELP. EVERYONE ACROSS THE BOARD. IN TERMS OF AFFORDABILITY. I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I WILL STAND UP AND SEND ALONG SIDE MY COLLEAGUES AS WE CONTINUE TO BRING FORWARD EQUALLY AS CHALLENGING COMPLEX MEASURES. TO ADDRESS NOT ONLY THE ROOT CAUSES OF OUR CURRENT HOUSING CRISIS BUT HOW WE WILL LEAD CALIFORNIA IN BEGIN OUR WAY OUT OF IT. CENTER DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I. RISE IN THE SUPPORT THIS BILL I WANTED. SHARE MAYBE A LITTLE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THAT I HAVEN'T HEARD YET SPOKEN ABOUT HERE TODAY. I THINK THIS IS A HEALTHY DEBATE I GIVE THE AUTHOR A LOT OF CREDIT FOR TACKLING THIS ISSUE THIS IS NOT EASY. IT'S CONTROVERSIAL- BUT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY BACKGROUND SIXTEEN YEARS ON A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS DOING GENERAL PLANS AND HEARING COUNTLESS VERY WELL EDUCATED PLANNERS ABOUT SMART GROWTH AND ABOUT SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES. AND ABOUT ALL THE REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD BUILD WHERE YOU SHOULD BUILD TO MAKE A SOCIETY- WORK IN A MANNER WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A FOOT PRINT ON THE LAND. AS HARSH AS IT CAN BE IN SOME AREAS. AND WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF TESTIMONY TODAY ABOUT. WAS SITTING IN THEIR AUTOMOBILES FOR HOURS MIGRATING TO AND FROM WORK. YOU KNOW YOU ALL KNOW I FARM AND ONE OF THE REASONS I GOT INVOLVED IN. POLITICS AND RUN FOR OFFICE WAS BECAUSE I SAW US PAVING OVER OUR FARM LAND'S. AND I THINK THAT'S WRONG I THINK THERE'S BETTER PLACES THE BILL DIDN'T ON OUR PURPOSE- FERTILE SOILS AND WHERE WE HAVE WATER TO GROW OUR CROPS. IT'S SO TODAY I LOOK AT THIS BILL AND I I'VE BEEN TOLD IN OUR DISTRICT HOW TO MANAGE MY LAND BY PEOPLE WHO DON'T MANAGE LAND I'VE HEARD FROM PEOPLE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY HOW TO MANAGE OUR FEDERAL FORCED TO DON'T LIVE. IN OUR FEDERAL FOREST. AND WE'RE BURNING DOWN AND WE SEE A LOT OF THINGS THAT AREN'T RIGHT. NOW IF YOU LOOK AT THIS BILL AND YOU LOOK AT WHAT IT IS DESIGNED TO DO IS DESIGNED TO PUT PEOPLE. WHERE THEY WORK AND KEEP THEM. FROM BUILDING IN OUR FARM LAND'S. END BEIG SITTING IN CARS AND DOING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT AND ARE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY SO I LOOK AT IT AND THAT TAXED. IS IT PERFECT THERE'S NO BILL THAT'S PERFECT IN THIS PLACE. I HEARD TALK ABOUT THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE. DO YOU GET A BILL EVERY HOME IN THE VALLEY OF THIS STATE BECAUSE MOST OF THE REST THE STATE AS WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE I HELD A MAP BUT WE DID SB NINE A ONE. AND IT'S READ ON EVERY SIDE EVEN THE COAST MOST THE COAST EXCEPT FOR THE VALLEY SO- BUT THIS BILL I THINK MAKES SENSE I THINK THE AUTHOR HAS DONE HIS JOB I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO- GET THIS BILL OUT OF THIS HOUSE OVER THE OTHER HOUSE AND LET'S BUILD SOME HOMES WHERE WE SHOULD BUILD OWNS. WHERE THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT. I DRIVE IN HIGHWAY FIFTY- SIT. OUT OF MY DISTRICT AND I GO BY THE HOSTESS. FACTORY THAT WE USED TO GET A HOSTESS TWINKIES OUT OF ITS SHUT DOWN RIGHT OUT OF TOWN HERE. IT'S VACANT IT HAS LIGHT RAIL RIGHT NEXT TO IT IT'S BEEN PAVED OVER. THOSE ARE PLACES WE SHOULD PUT HOMES. WE HAVE A HOUSING SHORTAGE. I'M A BELIEVER IN SUPPLY AND DEMAND WORKS WHEN YOU DRIVE THE SUPPLY UP THEY'LL BE LESS DEMAND AND IT DRIVES ACOSTA DOWN. WE NEED TO BUILD HOMES IN CALIFORNIA I BELIEVE THIS IS. ONE OF THE ANSWERS MANY OTHER ANSWERS OUT THERE SO I WOULD URGE YOU TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL I THINK THE AUTHOR I THANK YOU FOR THE DEBATE I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY. BUT LET'S DO SOMETHING GOOD FOR CALIFORNIANS TO MOVE THIS BILL OUT. SENATOR PORTANTINO. THANK YOU AYE MADAM PRESIDENT A MEMBERS AND I HAVE TO COMPLIMENT MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO FOR GIVING ME THE BEST BIRTHDAY PRESENT I'VE EVER GOTTEN- DISCUSSION OF SB FIFTY ON MY FIFTY NINTH BIRTHDAY SO THANK YOU FOR THAT- WE'RE BOTH FROM NEW JERSEY WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP AND I HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR HIM- AND I MUST RISE TO RESPECTFULLY- DISAGREE AND OPPOSE SB FIFTY- LAST YEAR WHEN I PUT THIS ON THE TO YOUR BILL LIST- I DID THAT ON PURPOSE IN ORDER NOT TO STOP THE DEBATE. MY HOPE WAS THAT OVER THE BREAK- WE COULD ENGAGE PEOPLE IN A PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION- TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE COMMENTS AND CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED TODAY- THE FACT YOU HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE STANDING UP. EXPRESSING VERY SIMILAR COMMENTS UNDERSCORES THAT THESE ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS- THAT WAS MY HOPE- BECAUSE I LEARNED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. WHEN WE HAD A DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CALLED REDEVELOPMENT. AND WE DISSOLVED IT. AND AT THE TIME THERE WAS TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE. WE'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING BETTER. WE'RE GOING TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS WE'RE GONNA NOT FORGET ABOUT FINDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I SAID AT THE TIME. DON'T DO AWAY WITH THIS PROGRAM AND TO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A REPLACEMENT IN PLACE. SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO FUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND EVERYBODY SAID DON'T WORRY. WE'LL GET IT RIGHT. JUST NOT TODAY. WELL HERE WE ARE NEARLY A DECADE LATER AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN JOSE AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM HUMBOLDT AND I JOINTLY AUTHORED SB FIVE. STILL TRYING TO REPLACE THAT DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HAD WE NOT DONE AWAY WITH REDEVELOPMENT WE WOULD HAVE PROBABLY HAD ABOUT TEN BILLION DOLLARS SPENT. ON ACTUALLY CONSTRUCTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO I SHARE THAT. TO UNDERSCORE OUR RESPONSIBILITY TODAY TO GET IT RIGHT. BECAUSE WE GOT IT WRONG A DECADE AGO AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS A CRITICAL CONVERSATION AND WHEN I HEAR MY GOOD COLLEAGUES WHO I RESPECT TREMENDOUSLY TALK ABOUT WELL THIS WILL COME BACK TO US. WELL IT'LL COME BACK TO US ON CONCURRENCE WERE WILL ONLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO AN UPPER DOWN VOTE WE WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY LOOK AND DISCUSS. THE POLICY. IN THE POLICY COMMITTEE ON THE MERITS OF THOSE AMENDMENTS AND SO. THAT'S WHY IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE TAKE THIS TIME AND I THINK IT WAS THE MAJORITY LEADER WHO MENTIONED. THIS BILL IF IT WERE TO MOVE OUT OF THIS HOUSE TODAY. WOULD STILL BE GOING THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS F. OF ANOTHER BILL WAS INTRODUCED SO. THE URGENCY OF THE SITUATION. CRIES OUT THAT WE ADDRESS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA WITH URGENCY. BUT THIS BILL DOESN'T DO THA. AND BY PASSING IT ALONG A DOZEN EXPEDITE THAT CONVERSATION IT FRANKLY SHORT CHANGED IS THAT CONVERSATION. IN THIS HOUSE THE STATE SENATE AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS IT'S BEEN RAISED WE HAVE AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS BUT YET IF YOU DO TEN UNITS OR LOWER. THERE'S NO AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT GETS DONE WITH THIS BILL IF YOU DO TWENTY UNITS TO TEN UNITS YOU CAN PAINT TO A FINE AND NOT BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT'S AN EASILY SOLVABLE CHANGE IN THIS BILL THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS BUT IT WASN'T SO THAT BEGS THE QUESTION. WHY WHY DIDN'T WE MAKE THIS BILL ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT'S BEEN ARGUED SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND TRICKLE DOWN ARE VALID SERIES WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST THAT THEY HAVEN'T REALLY WORKED ALL THAT MUCH THAT WELL- AND ONE COULD ARGUE THAT IF YOU INCREASE DENSITY YOUR INCREASING LAND VALUE WHICH INCREASES CONSTRUCTION COSTS WHICH RAISES RENTS. IT DOESN'T LOWER RENTS AND SO MUCH HAS BEEN MADE ABOUT THE COMMUNITIES IN THE PLACE AND THE SPECULATION OF WHERE THE OPPOSITION IS COMING FROM. AND THAT I HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM HAVE BEEN IN MY GOOD SENATOR TO MY LEFT. COMMUNITY AND MY SEAT MATES COMMUNITY HARD WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES CLOSE TO DOWNTOWN LA. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM LA TALK ABOUT WHO ARE IN FEAR. OF DISPLACEMENT AND GENTRIFICATION AND I THINK FOR GOOD REASON WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS MY OTHER CALLING FROM LOS ANGELES MANSION. THIS IS ABOUT MARKET RATE HOUSING. THERE IS A LEGITIMATE FEAR IN THOSE COMMUNITIES WITH. ADEQUATE PROTECTIONS WITHOUT SAYING THAT THESE HAVE TO BE AFFORDABLE UNITS WITHOUT PUTTING SERIOUS- CONTROLS ON HOW MUCH THEY WOULD GO IN THAT MARKET RATE PROPOSAL. THOSE ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS AND SO I BELIEVE MY COLLEAGUE SHOULD BE COMMENDED BECAUSE THE OTHER THING THAT'S BEING MENTIONED IS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RESPONSIBILITY WELL I CHARGE THE LA COUNTY LEAGUE AND ONE GARZA THEIR PRESIDENT WHO LIVES IN SENATOR ARCHER LET HIS DISTRICT WITH COMING UP WITH ALTERNATIVES. AND THEY ARE INITIALLY CAME UP WITH THOSE ALTERNATIVES AND THEY PUT THEM ON THE TABLE AND THEY WANTED TO GET TO YES SO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO. MOVED THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BAR FIRED THAN ANYONE WOULD HAVE ANTICIPATED AND I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE THAT OUT JERRY. TO PUT IN PLACE THE BILL THAT ACTUALLY PRESS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SHORTAGE AND USE. OUR MISS GOVERNMENT TO BE A PARTNER IN THIS CONVERSATION VERSUS PASSING A BILL THAT HAS BEEN. ADDED WITH ALL OF THE FLAWS STERN. CALLING TICKETED ONLY HAVE IT COME BACK TO THIS ON CONCURRENCE WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NO VOTE TODAY. SENATOR MOORLACH. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I GUESS WE CAN ALL CONCUR THAT THIS IS- A BILL THAT HAS PROVIDED SOME VERY GOOD- DEBATE- I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON PROPERTY RIGHTS- I WAS CHALLENGE YESTERDAY WITH THE QUESTION OF WHAT IS THE CONSERVATIVE VIEW OF. BUILDING HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA AND- WE ALWAYS SAY WELL IT'S A MATTER SUPPLY WE SHOULD. LET THE MARKET PROVIDE. A SUPPLY FOR THOSE IN THE MARKETPLACE. SO IT BROUGHT UP ALL KINDS OF QUESTIONS ONE. SHOULD CERTAIN REAL PROPERTY LOCATIONS BE REPURPOSE FOR HIGHER DENSITY HOUSING. IS THIS A FREE MARKET OPPORTUNITY HAVE CITIES BEEN TOO RESTRICTIVE IN THEIR ZONING OR HAS CALIFORNIA BEEN THE STRANGLEHOLD WITH THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT ARE ALSO KNOWN AS C. QUIRK. WORSE YET IN MY DISTRICT BEING COASTAL HAS THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION MAY BUILDING NEW HOUSING LESS THAN A BREAK EVEN BUSINESS PROPOSITION I HAVE ONE PROJECT IN WEALTH STILL MY DISTRICT. IF THEY WERE TRYING TO BUILD HOUSING THE ENTIRE EIGHT YEARS I WAS A SUPERVISOR. AND FIVE YEARS LATER THEY'RE STILL NOT ANY CLOSER. TO HAVE BEEN BUILT ONE. STRUCTURE ON A PIECE OF PROPERTY- SO ARE WE- IN THE WAY OF ALLOWING THE MARKET TO PROVIDE HOUSING. COLLEAGUES I HAVE GONE OUT OF MY COMFORT ZONE TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF SB FIFTY THIS IS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE FOR ME AND I HAVE A LOT OF GOOD DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE I STRONGLY BELIEVE IN LOCAL CONTROL. AND SO I'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH THE DEBATE OF WHAT IS LOCAL CONTROL. SHOULD IT BE THE LANDOWNER. SHOULD BE THE CITY COUNCIL THAT HAS MORE CONTROL OR SHOULD IT BE SACRAMENTO THAT HAS MORE CONTROL AND SB FIFTY BROACHES THESE THEMES. WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS ALL AGREED BUT I BELIEVE IT'S BEEN SELF INFLICTED BY THE THIS INSTITUTION. BY THIS BODY OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE. PASSED BILLS THAT HAVE MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR WELL MEANING DEVELOPERS AND ANY AND HERE WE ARE SO. IS THIS THE BEST BILL TO DO IT. NOW PROBABLY NOT IT GOES AFTER EVERY CITY BUT WITH LIMITED CARVE OUT AND I PREFER A BETTER NO BETTER NO WORSE APPROACH AND I HOPE AS IT GOES TO THE ASSEMBLY BUT SHOULD- THAT THEY MODIFY THE BILL TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE MANY AMENDMENTS. SOME CITIES ARE DOING WHAT WE WANT TO BAIT SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ENCOURAGE THESE THAT HAVE BEEN ADDING NEW HOUSING AT THE LIBERTY OF FASHION AND MAYBE GO A LITTLE STRONGER ON THE BAD ACTORS I THINK THE BILL ALSO NEEDS TO MORE CLEARLY DEFINED JOB RICH AREAS I AND BOUNDARIES AND I THINK UNLIMITED DENSITY IS OPAQUE AND THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED ABOUT THIS COULD BE REFINED GOING FORWARD. PARKING LIMITATIONS NEED MORE CLARIFICATION IS THE RULE OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN REFERRED TO SHOULD NOT COME INTO PLAY TO CREATE EVEN MORE PROBLEMS FOR OUR COMMUNITIES I THINK A SERIOUS REVIEW ALSO SHOULD BE DONE. ON PUBLIC TRANSIT. IT IT USAGE IS DECLINING AND WHEN AN ORANGE COUNTY WHEN WE RAISE OUR RATES BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY SUBSIDIZE 80% OF THE COST OF PROVIDING A BUS FLEET THAT WHEN YOU RAISE THE RATES THE RIDERSHIP GOES DOWN AND IT GETS CIRCULAR YOU KNOW THEN YOU GOT TO RAISE IT AGAIN AND THEN IT JUST IT JUST GETS ALL BENT OUT OF SHAPE SO I THINK THIS VICIOUS CYCLE WE NEED TO TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK. AT MASS TRANSIT BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS FAILED TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS. BECAUSE THE CARS ARE DEPENDABLE. EN MASS TRANSIT IS NOT AND SO WE SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED THAT THAT THAT'S THE CASE AND SO THAT NEEDS A HARD LOOK SB FIFTY SHOULD CAUSE US TO REFLECT ON THE GRAND SCHEME WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED BY SEVERAL OF OUR COLLEAGUES WHAT'S IN PLACE NOW IS NOT WORKING OPTIMALLY AND MAY BECOME EVEN GREATER SINK HOLES IN THE FUTURE AS OUR TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES. LITERALLY GO BANKRUPT TRYING TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS NOT WORKING INTEGRATION WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED GUESS CAPACITY NEEDS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE DISCUSSION MORE HOUSING EQUALS MORE CHILDREN. FOR CITIES THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN HOMELESS SHELTERS. THEY SHOULD BE REWARDED WITH SOME KIND OF OFFSETS- IN THAT PROVIDE SOME KIND OF BALANCE. AFTER DECADES OF BENIGN NEGLECT SB FIFTY PROVIDES A MASSIVE CULTURAL CHANGE. THIS GROUND SHAKING WAS PROBABLY LONG IN COMING. BUT THE REVERBERATIONS ARE DISTURBING THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN PROACTIVE IN THEIR LAND PLANNING AND GENERAL PLAN IMPLEMENTATIONS. CALIFORNIA MADE SOME SHAKING UP MADAM PRESIDENT. AT ALL LEVELS HERE AND DOWN TO THE CITY LEVEL I BELIEVE DISCUSSION MUST BE HAD AND MUST BE CONTINUED. BUT IT SHOULD BE BY A STRONG VOTE MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS. I DON'T WANT TO REITERATE WHAT EVERYONE HERE SAD BUT THE ONE THING I DO KNOW IS THAT I BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE IS RIGHT DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY COME FROM WE ARE CAST OUT BY NóI IN OUR OWN COMMUNITIES AND WHAT THE NEEDS ARE. AND I THINK IT REALLY DOES BLOW IT BOILED DOWN TO OUR OWN COMMUNITIES ECONOMICS DEMOGRAPHICS EVERYTHING THAT THAT REALLY SHAPES OUR OWN AREAS FOR EXAMPLE. I WANT TO ALSO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM LOS ANGELES BOTH OF THEM THAT- IN OUR AREA LOS ANGELES COUNTY THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE JUST PLEASE IN MY- IN THE COMMUNITY. CORRUPT IN. HOME ARE OVER HOUSING IS OVER A MILLION DOLLARS I COULD NEVER AFFORD THAT WE WERE DISPLACED AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I TAKE VERY PERSONALLY OUR FIRST I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR BECAUSE I KNOW THAT HE'S BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD ON THIS ISSUE AND TAKEN A LOT OF TME TO LISTEN TO OUR CONCERNS AND TRY TO SOLVE OUR CONCERNS. THIS LAST WEEK I GATHERED MY TEEN CITIES TO HEAR HIS CONCERNS AND HE TOOK THE TIME TO ANSWER EACH AND EVERYONE OTHER QUESTIONS AND SO I BELIEVE THAT THAT HE IS STATE TO TRY MAKE THIS BILL BETTER. TO TRY TO HELP OUT BUT- IN MY COMMUNITY LAST YEAR I PASSED HOUSING. AND I PROMISE MY COMMUNITIES THAT IF THEY CAME TO THE TABLE AND HELP ME SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS. THAT WE COULD DO THIS. TOGETHER BASED ON OUR OWN CIRCUMSTANCE AND BASED ON OUR OWN COMMUNITIES AND THE DATE THAT I PASSED THE BILL LAST YEAR. AND WE ARE ACTIVELY CRATE ACTIVELY ENGAGED ON WHAT THAT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE SO I CAN PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR BUILDING HOMES. PARTICULAR LOW INCOME HOUSING BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DISCUSSED EARLIER IS THAT LOW INCOME AFFORDABILITY MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE. THE AVERAGE INCOME IN ONE OF MY COMMUNITY SAYS FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND. LOS ANGELES I BELIEVE IT'S SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND. CALIFORNIA OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND. SO EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT PERCEPTION OF WHAT THAT MEANS AND IN MY COMMUNITY. IT'S REALLY THE FEAR THAT- MY COLLEAGUES ON THE SANTA LEAST TALKED ABOUT. HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT GONNA GET DOES PLEASE I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IF ONE SIZE FITS ALL I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE BUILD HOUSES. IT'S GOING TO MEAN THE SAME THING FOR EVERYONE. AND IN MY COMMUNITIES ONLY TAKE THE TIME TO TALK ABOUT THE CITIES WE'VE BEEN HEARING OFTEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO HELP IN THAT WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE NEED TO COME TO THE TABLE. WELL I CAN TELL YOU WITH CERTAINTY MY FIFTEEN COMMUNITIES DID COME TO THE TABLE. THEY DID WORK ON THE ON THE HOUSING TRUST AND THEY'RE ACTIVELY PUTTING FUNDING NOT TRUST TO TRY AND SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS. SO FOR ME- NOT ALL THE ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED AND I WANT TO GIVE MY COMMUNITY THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THAT HOUSING TRUST. AND IT'S NOT IT HELLO. I STILL WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS. BUT AFTER MEETING WITH THE WITH THE AUTHOR I COMMUNITIES WITHIN QUIET AND- AN AGREEMENT AT WHEN I CAN AT THE- MOVE TOWARD I JUST HAD THIS POINT I NEED TO. WORK WITH MY COMMUNITY SINCE THE POWER HAS. BEEN TOUCHED WORKS THANK YOU. JUST PRESIDENT I I'D LIKE THANK OF THE COM THAT WERE OUT TO READ BY THE CENTER FOR MOST. WE ALL COME FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES WE ALL DIFFERENT PRIORITIES DIFFERENT SENSIBILITIES DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS AND NOT ONE IS MORE RIGHT THAN THE OTHER. AND I THINK THIS IS A FANTASTIC EXAMPLE OF DEMOCRACY IN ACTION IN THE PUREST FORM. WE AVE ONE PARTY SPLIT THE OTHER FRACTURED AS WELL. AND TO ME I THINK THIS IS A FANTASTIC IDEA THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY DEBATE AN ISSUE ON THE MERITS AN INTERNIST SO I'D LIKE TAKE VENGEANCE OPPORTUNITY IN COMMAND TO THE CENTER FROM LOS FROM MY SAN FRANCISCO. FOR MEETING WITH ME TALKING WITH ME MEETING FRANKLY WITH EVERYBODY AND BEING OPEN TO THE AMENDMENTS TO TRY TO MAKE THIS A BETTER PRODUCT. I DON'T THINK WE'RE THERE YET. AND I WANT TO I WANT TO GET AT LEAST EXPLAIN JUST A LITTLE BIT ON WINE. SO THE CELTS WE HAVE A WE HAVE A SITUATION HERE WHERE WE HAVE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. AND IN SOME INSTANCES I THINK THAT CAN WORK WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND- AND POPULATION DISPLACEMENT IT CLEARLY DOESN'T. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I PUT FORWARD TO THE AUTHOR OF THIS PIECE LEGISLATION IS. MAYBE WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS A LITTLE BIT WRONG. MAYBE A BETTER APPROACH MIGHT BE TO LOOK UPON IT WITH THE CALCULATION RATIO. MEANING THAT THE AREAS THAT HAVE THE MOST HOUSING NEEDS BECAUSE NOT ALL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA ARE EQUAL IN THAT WERE IN THAT REGARD THAT WE HAVE A CALCULATION BASED RATIO. ON NEEDS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK COULD BE TERRIBLY HELPFUL- BUT NOW WE ARE WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW AT THE END OF A- THE CARRY OVER FROM LAST YEAR AND MOVING INTO THE NEW LEGISLATIVE CYCLE. I DON'T VIEW TODAY'S VOTE AS THE END OF THIS ISSUE IN FACT I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE THIS TO BE SHOULD NOT PASSED TODAY AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE VOTES MAY MAY LIE ON THIS. BUT I'M HOPING THAT THE AUTHOR IF IT WERE NOT TO PASSED TODAY SIMPLY REINTRODUCE IT SO THAT WE CAN AGAIN- BRING IN MORE STAKEHOLDERS AND I THINK GET A CLOSER LOOK AT WHAT OTHER OPTIONS MIGHT EXIST. FROM THE VALLEY PERSPECTIVE I REPRESENT THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND REBEKAH REPRESENT ELEVEN COUNTIES. NOW THE COUNTIES UP NORTH. DON'T SEEM TO BE AS A AS AFFECTED AS THE COUNTIES. IN THE SELF. AND SO I HAVE ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT- PEOPLE TALKING TO MIGHT YEAR OVER THE LAST. NUMBER OF WEEKS ON WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN. THERE IS NO CONCURRENCE. THE ONLY THING THAT. FOLKS AGREE ON IS THAT WE NEED HOUSING. HOW WE GET THERE EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT HAS A DIFFERENT THEORY. AND ALL. TO BE FAIR TO THE FOLKS THAT I REPRESENT I REACH OUT TO A NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES IN MY DISTRICT. AND I RECEIVED- WAS REALLY GOT THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES OPPOSITION TO THIS. I GOT CITY OF CLOVIS IS OPPOSITION TO THIS AND- MY FORMER. POLITICAL POSITION. IN MY FOR POLITICAL POSITION I GOT A LETTER FROM THE FOR FROM FRESNO COUNTING IN OPPOSITION TO THIS. SO THAT PUTS ME IN A PRETTY INTERESTING SITUATION WHERE- SO MY LARGEST CONSTITUENCIES ARE OPPOSED TO THIS. AND I HAVE TO ASK WHY. NO I DON'T ALWAYS AGREE WITH WHAT THE ANSWERS THAT I'VE BEEN GIVEN IN FACT I THINK THERE IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE MUST PURSUE BUT ONE GLARING REALITY IS THAT. ANY IMPOSITION ON IN IN THE HOUSING REALM WILL EXPAND ELSEWHERE INTO THE NEIGHBORING COUNTIES THE NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES US NOT ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHING WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE SO MY POINT IN ALL THIS IS THAT. I WOULD LIKE THIS TO CONTINUE TO BE RE INTRODUCE. AS SOON AS TOMORROW IT SHOULD IT NOT PASSED TODAY SO THAT WE CAN LOOK AT WHAT WHATEVER. CALCULATION CAN BE ALLOWED WITH THIS TYPE OF ONE SIZE FITS ALL BECAUSE THIS NOTION OF LOCAL CONTROL. IS LOCAL CONTROL IF YOU IT HERE AND AGREE WITH WITH- SACRAMENTO'S VISION. AND THAT'S MY PROBLEM IS I DON'T THINK THE LOCAL CONTROL IS TRUE BUT IT CAN BE AND I WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE AND I THINK- THE CENTER FROM SAN FRANCISCO'S DONE AN EXEMPLARY JOB OF PUSHING THIS ISSUE. I WON IT PUSHED EVEN FURTHER AND I BELIEVE THAT ALL THE FOLKS THAT ARE BEHIND THIS. THE FOLKS IN THE INDUSTRY. IN THE WE CANNOT AFFORD ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK I THINK WE'RE ALMOST THERE I JUST DON'T THINK WE'RE THERE YET. SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS WELCOME SAN FRANCISCO FORCE HARD WORK- HIS DEDICATION TO THIS ISSUE AND MEETING WOULD PROBABLY ALL OF HIS COLLEAGUES AND TRYING TO WORK OUT A ISSUE THAT IS NEAR AND DEAR TO ALL OF US OF HOW DO WE- ADDRESS. A HOUSING CRISIS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AFFORDABILITY CRISIS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IN MANY WAYS A SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE STATED A- CRISIS THAT WAS. EXACERBATED BY FOLKS LIKE MYSELF IN THE LEGISLATURE WHO VOTED AND- NINE YEARS AGO IN REDEVELOPMENT A TOOL THAT HOPED TO BUILD REAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN MY CHALLENGE WITH THIS BILL IS THAT. AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS REALLY NOT BEING BUILT HERE THE END INTENT IS THERE BUT THE MECHANISM OF HOW DO WE GET THERE THAT'S MY BIGGEST CONCERN BECAUSE IT IS ABOUT AFFORDABILITY I'VE TALKED TO. WORKING FOLKS PEOPLE WHO MAKE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IN NAY STEEL CAN AFFORD TO BUY A HOUSE IN CALIFORNIA I TALKED TO ONE INDIVIDUAL SAYS I HAVE TWO CHOICES ONE LOOKING FOR THE HOUSE. I'M LOOKING FOR THE WORST HOUSE ON THE BEST BLOCK. OR THE BEST HOUSE ON THE WORST BLOCK. AND THAT'S ALL I CAN AFFORD AND THAT'S ALL THE SHOW ME AND WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT. AND WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT ZONING ZONING IT'S WHAT I LIKE THE MOST ABOUT THIS BILL BECAUSE THE SENATORS RIDER WE KNOW THE HISTORY OF OUR ONE IT WAS RACES AND HIS IMPLEMENTATION IT WAS A DIRECT RESULT OF BLACK LAWYERS SUING. REGARD RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AND COMMUNITIES RESPONDED WHAT ARE ONE ZONING IT WAS AT AFTER AN AMERICAN LEGISLATOR HERE IN THIS VERY BODY BYRON ONE BIRD WHO CAME UP WITH THE FAIR HOUSING ACT IN RESPONSE TO THIS DISCRIMINATORY ARE ONE ZONING. THERE ARE COMMUNITIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA ALL ONE ZONING STATE ONE HOUSE PER ACRE. ONE HOUSE PER ACRE HOW'S THAT INCLUSIONARY IS EXCLUSIONARY SO. THE ALL ONE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED I'M YOU'RE COMMITTED TO WORK ON THAT AREA AFFORDABILITY WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE PARADIGM OF UNDERSTANDING WORKING CLASS FOLKS CAN'T AFFORD HOUSING WE GOT TO CHANGE THE PARADIGM THAT. AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS. LOWER QUALITY AND YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO ATTRACT BLOCKING MINORITIES AS DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING STATED THE MOBILITY FOR THE AFRICAN AMERICAN IN THE SIXTIES WITH WHAT FROM ONE SMALL GET OLD TO A BIGGER GET ALL WE NEED TO- FOR MAKE HOUSING AFFORDABLE FOR ALL FOLKS TO LOOK- REACHED AMERICAN DREAM SO I STAND COMMITTED TO WORKING TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. CENTER LEYVA. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU TO EVERYONE REALLY IT'S VERY I HAVE ENJOYED HEARING FROM EVERYONE AND I JUST BEFORE I BEGIN MY COMMENTS I WANT TO SAY THAT MIRACLES DO HAPPEN I NEVER THOUGHT THAT THE SENATOR FROM ORANGE COUNTY AND I WOULD ACTUALLY AGREE ON SOMETHING SO THERE'S A FIRST FOR EVERYTHING. MEMBERS AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR THAT THERE ARE THERE'S A LOT OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT SB FIFTY OUT THERE I'M SURE MANY OF YOU ARE LIKE ME IN YOUR TWITTER FEED IS BLOWING UP AND YOU WANT TO RESPOND BACK AND SAY READ THE BILL THAT'S NOT WHAT IT SAYS. HOWEVER MEMBERS ONE THING IS CLEAR WE DO HAVE MORE TO DO TO FIX THE HOUSING CRISIS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE STATUS QUO IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUH THERE ARE OTHER PROPOSALS BEFORE US IN THE LEGISLATURE. BUT TODAY SB FIFTY IS THE BILL BEFORE US MEMBERS I'VE LISTENED TO ARGUMENTS FROM THE PROPONENTS THAT THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I HAVE ALSO LISTEN TO THE CONCERNS FROM CITIES ELECTED OFFICIALS AND COMMUNITY RESIDENTS AND LEADERS PARTICULARLY SINCE THE AUTHOR TOOK AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL EARLY THERE THIS MONTH. TO OFFER MORE LOCAL CONTROL. THE EVERY COMMUNITY A COUNTY IS DIFFERENT THE PROBLEM IS CLEARLY STATEWIDE. LOCALITIES HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO STEP UP AND MAKE THE NECESSARY CHANGES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO HELP GROW AFFORDABLE AND SUSTAINABLE HOUSING. IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES AND REGION. AND QUITE HONESTLY IT JUST HASN'T HAPPENED AND I SEE A LOT TO MY CITIES IN MY COUNTIES. DON'T WAIT FOR US TO DO IT FIX IT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE WHAT WE COME UP WITH. SB FIFTY GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TODAY. MADAM PRESIDENT I WAS ONE IF I COULD ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. THE QUESTIONS. THAT OBJECTION. THANK YOU UGH TEN A PROTECTIONS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS A BIG CONCERN TO ME AND I THINK IT IS A CONCERN TO OTHERS I THINK THAT THE TEN A PROTECTIONS THAT WE HAVE NOW UNDER STATE LAW ALLOW DEVELOPERS TO COME IN UNDER THE ELLIS ACT IN JUST BULLDOZE- OKAY A DEVELOPMENT AND BUILD WILL THIS BILL HELPS THAT IS IT BETTER IS IT STRONGER OR NOT. I SURE- THROUGH THE PRESIDENT I THANK YOU AS CENTER FOR THAT- A QUESTION- I TOUCHED ON THIS EARLIER BUT I WANT TO REITERATE BECAUSE EVER SINCE STATEMENTS MADE ABOUT- RENT TO PROTECTIONS ON SB FIFTY HAS THE STRONGEST RENTER PROTECTIONS IN EXISTENCE UNDER STATE LAW- IF A RENTER'S LIVED ON THE PROPERTY AT ANY POINT IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS OR OF AN ALICE ACTIVATION HAS HAPPENED AT ANY POINT IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS YOU CANNOT DEMOLISH THE BUILDING FOR AN SB FIFTY- PROJECT. THIS IS STRONGER THAN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CITIES- HAVE IN TERMS OF PROTECTIONS STRONGER THE VAST MAJORITY CITIES IN CALIFORNIA I DO WANT TO- WHICH IS NO BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES- AND I WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT SPECIFIC TO THIS ISSUE THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES AS WELL. THESE RENTER PROTECT. THE DEMOLITION. SB ARE STRONGER THAN THE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE BY THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES STRONGER. SO I DON'T THINK IT'S ACCURATE TO SUGGEST THAT THIS BILL WILL SOMEHOW MAKE IT EASIER TO OBJECTS. TENANTS WERE DEMOLISHED BUILDINGS IN LOS ANGELES THIS WILL MAKE IT. HARDER BY IN ADDITION- I WILL NOTE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT- THE TRANSIT ORIENTED COMMUNITIES OR TOC PROGRAM IN LOS ANGELES WHERE IT WAS UP SO ON. HER VOTER INITIATIVE IT'S A MINORITY OF THE CITY GEOGRAPHICALLY BUT IT'S A VERY EXCELLENT EXCELLENT PROGRAM- AND IN FACT IT'S SO EXCELLENT AND SO ROBUST- DIE WE- IT'S EFFECTIVELY EXEMPTED FROM THIS BILL. BECAUSE IT ALLOWS ACTUALLY MORE OF ZONING THAT SB FIFTY DOLLARS AND SO IT'S NOT ACCURATE THAT THIS BILL WILL DELAY ANYTHING INTO YOUR SEE. AN ALLY. BY NOTE HOWEVER. THERE ARE APPARENTLY QUITE A FEW PROJECTS BUILT UNDER TOC IN LOS ANGELES. AT RESULTS FROM ELLIS OF BUILDING AND THEN TEARING IT DOWN TO BUILD A BIGGER BILL. I'M NOT EXISTING T. T. S. FIFTY WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT WE GO BEYOND. THOSE TEN PROTECTIONS. STRONG TO REDUCTIONS IN WITH THAT SAID WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH RENTS ARE ADVOCATES- TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS THERE TO SAY. AND I WILL JUST END BY SAYING. I SUPPORT THE RENT REGISTRY. THAT SOMEONE NUMBER WICKS AUTHORED IRISH'S REINTRODUCE. SHE'S THE PUBLIC I THOUGHT- JUMPING ON FOR HER I DON'T THINK IT'S INTO LAW I AND I'M ASSIST. THE BILL'S BECAUSE I WAS THE ME I AM COMMITTED TO THIS ISSUE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON A FURTHER. THANK YOU THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL TO HEAR THAT THE TEN A PROTECTIONS WOULD ACTUALLY BE STRONGER. UNDER SB FIFTY. OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING I'VE HEARD A LOT OF THAT I THINK IT'S A HUGE CONCERN FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US. ON THIS FLOOR I HAVE MET WITH THE VERBAL PURRS AND I'VE ASKED THEM WHY THEY DON'T DEVELOP MORE. AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THE WHOLE ME THAT THEY DO THEY DON'T IT'LL BE. UP MY ANY MONEY OFF OF IT. IN SB FIVE. IF I'M READING CORRECTLY. HOW. WITHOUT SB FIFTY ARE THERE ANY OTHER REGULATIONS. IN STATE LAW RIGHT NOW THAT ARE REQUIRING DEVELOPERS TO BUILD IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT ALL. ON SO- IT SB FIFTY- WILL- I HAD I THINK THE STRONGEST AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS UNDER STATE LAW. AND IN FACT UNLIKE THE STATE DENSITY BONUS WHICH IS EXISTING LAW WHICH ALLOWS FOR MODERATE LOW INCOME IN VERY LOW INCOME. SB FIFTY FOR THE FIRST TIME ALSO INCLUDES AN OPTION FOR EXTREMELY LOW INCOME. WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY EITHER FORMALLY HOMELESS PEOPLE OR PEOPLE LIVING ON SSI CHECK- CHECKS TO THE POOREST OF THE POOR SO WE ARE BREAKING SOME NEW GROUND. IN TERMS OF STATE AFFORDABILITY LEVELS- IN THIS LAW- HI. ANY CITY THAT HAS AN INCLUSIONARY ORDINANCE. IF YOU KNOW HOW% PARCELS OF WORDS OWNS A SINGLE FAMILY WHICH WERE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE NOW IS ON MULTI UNITS. YOU YOU MULTI UNIT WILL TRIGGER THE AFFORDABILITY AND LEAD TO MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS- AND TALK TO SAN FRANCISCO PLANNING DEPARTMENT DID A STUDY. I CONCLUDED THAT SB FIFTY WILL AND READY TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN AFFORDABLE UNITS THAT IS TRUE IN ANY CITY- WITH INCLUSIONARY. OF NO ALSO SPECIFIC TO THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES CA SEVERAL DIFFERENT COMMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. CURRENTLY 75% OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. ZONE IN A WEB. WERE AFFORDABLE. BANDS YOU CAN'T BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE SEVENTY FIVE CENT OF SOUNDS LISTA CITY. THAT IT DAWNED ON PERCENT FAMILY. NAME IS TRUE SEVEN SEC. I SENT. THIRTY SO WE'RE IN THIS TO. BY AND SAN FRANCISCO. I HEARD ENOUGH ABOUT. AT THE WALL THE REASON WHY FIVE HUNDRED YEAR TOTAL. TEN OF THEM BEFORE I WOULD I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT IT CAME. RESPECTFULLY IS NOT. IT WILL BE A TO. HIGHER NOT THAN NOT. AND IT IN THE SO OF LOS. AL OF THE TO USE AREA ALSO IN THE BOOK OF LOS ANGELES THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT TO DO ANY ON SITE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OUTSIDE OF THE TOC AREA. THERE'S ANOTHER THERE'S A LINKAGE FEE THAT YOU PAY. LINCOLN CHAFEE BUT THERE'S NO ONSITE REQUIRED AND SO FOR THERE TO BE CRITICISM OF SB FIFTY BECAUSE WE MANDATE ON SITE AFFORDABLE FOR TWENTY UNITS ARE MORE. BUT FOR A LEAD IN THE TWENTY UNITS- WOULD PAY A FEE. SB FIFTY GOES BEYOND THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES DRAMATICALLY IN TERMS OF AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS IN THE LARGE MAJORITY OF THAT CITY- AND WILL INCREASE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH IS WHY SO MANY NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUILDERS. THE NONPROFIT SECTOR THEIR ONLY JOB IS TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE- AND FORMALLY HOMELESS PEOPLE NOT ALL OF THEM ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL BUT MANY. OF THEM ARE AND THEN FINALLY WE GOT A REQUEST FOR AN AMENDMENT FROM AN ORGANIZATION IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY CALLED THE QUEEN OF BEAUTIFUL AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUP- TO- HELP MAKE SURE THAT A CHUNK OF THE AFFORDABLE UNITS PRODUCED UNDER THIS BILL. WOULD BE- PRIORITIZE FOR LOCAL RESIDENTS TO THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN A COMMUNITY CAN HAVE ACCESS TO WHAT'S BEING BUILT THERE WE MADE THAT AMENDMENT. PREFERENCE- FOR LOCAL RESIDENTS- AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE- OF THE BILL SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT IS FOR HELPFUL THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. MEMBERS NONE OF US CAME HERE TO DO THE EASY WORK WE ALL CAME HERE TO DO THE HARD WORK AND I WOULD PUT THIS IN THE CATEGORY OF HARD WORK. I STAND HERE BEFORE YOU IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL WITH ALL A LEVIN OF MY CITIES IN OPPOSITION. SO I WILL HAVE EXPLAINING TO DO WHEN I GO BACK HOME BUT I THINK WHEN I SIT DOWN AND TALK TO THE OUR CITIES MY CITIES. THERE'S SOMETHING THAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND AND I HOPE THAT I CAN HELP THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT. I THINK IT'S EASY TO PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS BUT WHAT'S REALLY DIFFICULT IS TO FIND A BILL OR FIND SOMETHING WHERE EVERYBODY'S A LITTLE HAPPY. THERE WAS A LITTLE UNHAPPY I THINK RIGHT NOW THIS BILL IS SB FIFTY. IF IT GETS OFF THE FLOOR TODAY THERE CERTAINLY MORE WORK THAT WILL BE DONE. I WOULD IMPLORE EVERYONE HERE TODAY TO GIVE GO UP ON THE BILL FOR THE BILL GETS OUT OF THE HOUSE WE CAN DO SOME MORE WORK ON IT. I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR I THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING OU'VE DONE AND I THINK ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES FOR ALL OF THEIR COMMENTS CONCERNS. THIS IS THE MOST PRESSING ISSUE WITH NO FOR EVERYONE IN THE STATE FOR YOU. CAME OUT OF. I REGION I HAVE. SENATOR ALAN. MEMBERS CERTAINLY WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THIS ROBUST DISCUSSION- I DO ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE AUTHOR IS HELP TO SHIFT THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE NEED FOR HOUSING AND I'VE I'VE SEEN AS A RESULT- MEMBERS OF MY OWN LOCAL COMMUNITY TALKING ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND THAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE CONSIDERED SEVERAL YEARS EARLIER AND I THINK YOU SEEN SOME AGGRESSIVE BUT CERTAINLY INADEQUATE LEGISLATION PASSED OUT OF THIS HOUSE- BECAUSE OF HIS EFFORTS- I CONTINUE TO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL THAT I AND I APPRECIATE THE CALL IF WE THAT WE JUST. HEARD ABOUT AFFORDABILITY BUT I THINK ONE THE CONCERN WE HAVE ABOUT THE BILL AS IT IS AND WHEN THE REASONS WHY SO MANY OF THE TENANTS GROUPS AND THE AND YOU KNOW THE AB THE POVERTY ADVOCATES AND A POVERTY ADVOCATES ARE ARE SO CONTINUE TO BE SO CONCERNED THE BILL IS DIED IN YET TODAY EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT YOU TALK ABOUT. FARM 48% OF AVERAGE ME INCOME. IT DOES OFFER PROOF. FOR GOING LOWER- BUT IN THE END OF THE DAY THOSE POSTS PROVISIONS ARE OPTIONAL. AND SO- YEAH I THINK THAT'S THAT'S BEEN A LITTLE LOST IN IN SOME OF THE DISCUSSION. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT CITIES WITH VARYING LEVELS OF EFFORT- AND THE BILL DOES NOT. ADEQUATELY PROVIDE FOR DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO THOSE DIFFERENT CITIES IN THEIR LEVELS OF EFFORT. AND I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER CHALLENGE THAT I HAVE WITH THE BILL THE OTHER THING I WANT TO BRING UP AND- YOU KNOW AND I DO REALLY ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH ALL THE COMMENTS MADE BY PACIFIC FROM MY COLLEAGUES IN LOS ANGELES- WE HAD SEVERAL WHO HAVE. BROUGHT UP A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT I WON'T REPEAT- BUT THERE IS A WHOLE OTHER CHALLENGES TO SEE WITH HISTORIC ZONES. MAKING SURE THERE ARE- WITH THE WITH THE STORE CHARACTER OF A MANY OF OUR NEIGHBORS IS. EVAN PROTECTED I KNOW THERE'S SOME WHICH IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW TO PRESERVE. AND PROTECT THOSE HISTORIC ZONES THAT WERE REGISTERED WITH THE STATE. PRIOR TO TWENTY TEN. BUT THE FACT THE MATTER IS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE STARK SONS IN THE STATE. WE'RE NOT REGISTERED WITH THE STATE THE- SERVER THERE CAN WITH A- CITIES. BECAUSE THERE WAS ACTUALLY NO. TO SIR WITH THE STATE HAVE TO BE VERY EXCITED. I YEARS ON TO REGISTER. SALINAS REASON. YEAH AND I WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT AS WELL BECAUSE- WE'VE A LOT OF NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WOULD BE REAL IN IN. I THINK THAT A LOT OF MEMBERS DON'T DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE REALITY IN AND WHERE THE BILL IS SO FOR THAT REASON I AM NOT GOING UP ON THE BILL TODAY. SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU A MAN PRESIDENT CHAN I WASN'T PLANNING ON SPEAKING- CHAIR WITH YOU VERY BRIEFLY I COME FROM A COMMUNITY SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY THAT WAS BUILT ON BY THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WE ENTERED OUR CITIES AND MINE THIRTY YEARS AGO WE HAVE 525% AFFORDABLE AFFORDABILITY TO LOW VERY LOW AND MODERATE AND TODAY NONE OF THOSE- RESIDENTS EXIST LIKE THINK THE MEDIAN ALL HOME PRICE IN JUST MY CDS EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ALL AROUND ME AND IT GOES UP FROM THERE AND HE AND SANTA MANY OF FOR MILLION TO. LAGUNA BEACH IS OVER TWO MILLION AND THOSE ARE PLACES WHERE THERE WAS A REQUIREMENT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO THAT'S NUMBER ONE I'M NOT SURE OVER THE LONG HAUL WE'RE ABLE TO BECAUSE OF PROPERTY RIGHTS AND SECOND GENERATIONS TO HOLD IT THAT WAY THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULDN'T TRY BUT THERE'S A COMMON DOMINATOR AND EVERYTHING WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR CITIES AND I'D LIKE US TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE KEY THE KEY TO SOLVING THE PROBLEM AND IT DOES NEED MORE TIME AND- I'D LIKE TO READ IF I MAY MADAM PRESIDENT IT COMES FROM THE CITY OF CARLSBAD A LARGE COASTAL CITY. THIS NOT EXEMPTED THEIR POPULATION IS A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND BETTER BUT THEY ARE SAYING IN THIS GOES TO THE HARD WORK OF OUR OF. JERRY I THINK NOBLE FINISH FOR. THE SAN FRANCISCO WHOSE WORK SO HARD BUT THERE'S STILL MORE TO DO. THEY SAY THE CITY IS ENCOURAGED BY RECENT AMENDMENTS THAT APPEAR TO PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH AN ALTERNATIVE PLANNING PROCESS. TO DEVELOP LOCAL FLEXIBILITY PLAN TO MEET THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF. SENATE BILL FIFTY I'VE HEARD A NUMBER OF MY- COLLEAGUES. THIS AFTERNOON REFER TO THAT ALL WILL THE CITIES HAVE. DISCRETION WHAT THEY REALLY DON'T BECAUSE THERE'S NO CRITERIA THAT'S BEEN DEVELOPED THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WHAT WE'RE DOING WE'RE DELEGATING THAT AUTHORITY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT THE OFFICE OF PLANNING. AND RESEARCH TO DEVELOP RULES REGULATIONS OR GUIDELINES FOR SUBMISSION OF A LOCAL FLEXIBILITY PLAN. EVERYONE OF US KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN BILLS GO THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD WITH THE PROMISES THAT ARE THERE THAT IS GOING TO BE FLEXIBLE IS GOING TO ADDRESS LOW INCOME FOLKS. AND THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN BECAUSE IT DOES NOT COME BACK TO US WE HAD A NUMBER OF DEBATES WHEN I WAS FIRST ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. COMMITTEE THAT THE THING SHOULD COME BACK TO LEAVE OUR FORMER PUT HIM. OF RESPONSIBLY AND ON FEW OF THOSE. CONTENTIOUS THAT. ARE LOW NEIGHBORHOODS THE WOULD COME OUT IT DID NOT. SO THIS THE LACK OF TRUST IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL THAT THIS WILL COME OUT. FOR HERE NOT AN IMMENSE THAT GO A LONG WAY TO TRY TO SOLVE WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE. THE COMMON DENOMINATOR WHERE YOU HAVE RESISTANCE MARSEILLE. FIFTY HIGH EMAIL ARE THOUGHT THE DAY. FROM THESE COMMUNITIES ALL OVER THE STATE A LOT FOR MY DISTRICT WITH MANY UP A DOWN THIS. I HAVE OVER FIFTY LETTERS HERE FROM CITIES OBJECTING TO THIS ON THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE. THAT'S WHAT THE NEED WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE THAT'S WHERE WE CAN ABDICATE OUR RESPONSE WE NEED TO BE PART. OF THE- MAKE FOR VERY VERY POOR. STEP WE'RE TAKING TO CREATE A FOR. IN THIS. SO I COULD NOT SO TODAY I PLEDGE ISSUE AND THE FACT THAT OUR COMMUNITY WAS BECOMING ONLY ONE FOR A LEAD. WE MADE A DIFFERENCE WHO WORKED WITH OUR DEVELOPERS WE HAD A LOT OF MEETINGS THAT WE CHANGE SOME OF THE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS THEM AND WE WERE ABLE TO BUILD MULTI FAMILY. IF YOU DRIVE THE I FIVE THAT CROWN VALLEY AND THE I. FIVE YOU'LL SEE A NUMBER. OF AYE NEW APARTMENTS THAT HAVE BUILT IN BUILT ON BOTH SIDES OF THE FREEWAY THERE TO ADDRESS THIS BUT WE HAVE TO GIVE OUR CITIES. THE ABILITY TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT LOCAL FLEXIBILITY PLANET WE CAN ONLY DO THAT THROUGH THE REPRESENTATIVES THAT SIT ON THIS FLOOR. AND I THINK THEN WE CAN MOVE FORWARD VERY RAPIDLY AND MEET THOSE DEADLINES THAT WE ARE TRYING TO CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING- IN OUR STATE. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. SENATE SENATOR GONZALEZ. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES I HAD I ALSO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES- JUST FOR THE VERY THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION AS WELL AS OUR SENATOR FROM SACKED FROM STORMS ARE NOT FROM SACRAMENTO FROM SAN FRANCISCO I REALLY APPRECIATE- YOUR WORK YOU MET WITH MANY OF MY CITIES AND I JUST APPRECIATE THAT- THAT WORK UP UNTIL NOW AND SO JUST A FEW THINGSTHAT CAME IN JUST KIND OF HOT OFF THE PRESSES THAT I WANTED TO ENSURE THAT I WAS ADDRESSING ON BEHALF OF A HALF OF MY CITY. ARE HAVE THE DISTRICT WHICH IS A CITY OF LONG BEACH ACTUALLY PROP PROVIDED REALLY GOOD SOLUTIONS IN A PROPOSAL- WHICHHAD NOT BEEN DISCUSSED BEFORE BUT JUST SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT BECAUSE I MEN OF THE SAME SENTIMENT WHETHER YOU ARE A YES OR NO ON THIS I THINK WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT THAT THIS HAS A LOT MORE WORK TO DO. I'M STILL NOT DONE. I HAVE TO ENSURE THAT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TONIGHT I HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH. MY CITIES AND ESPECIALLY MANY OF YOUR CITIES WERE SMALLER CITIES. THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY IN FUNDING TO PRODUCE HOUSING ELEMENTS EVEN THE BASIC. EVEN BEFORE THIS BECAME. A TO FRUITION. AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING THOSE SUPPORTS. SECONDLY THE FLEXIBILITY PLAN AS MENTIONED BEFORE YOU KNOW IT'S A TWO OR A FIVE YEAR PLAN WHICH ISN'T. NECESSARILY EXPLICIT ON WHO IS A SENSE OF- SENSITIVE COMMUNITY. BUT PERHAPS A COULD BE IN. A THREE YEAR PLAN. DOWN THE ROAD BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY CITIES LIKE A CITY OF LONG BEACH OR SOME OTHER CITIES THAT ARE SPOTTY. THERE'S SOME PLACES THAT ARE SENSITIVE THERE'S SOME PLACES THAT ARE NOT. AND LASTLY I JUST WANT TO SAY WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INCLUSIONARY ZONING COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL. FROM A CITY THAT HAS BEEN TRYING TO PUSH FOR INCLUSIONARY ZONING AND DIDN'T HASN'T HAD IT DONE YET. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE INCLUSIONARY ZONING IS EVERYWHERE- RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A FEW CITIES WHO ARE DOING IT AND A LOT WHO ARE NOT. A LOT TO DO NOT HAVE ANY AFFORDABLE HOUSING REQUIREMENTS WHATSOEVER AS WE KNOW- I CAME OFF OF A GENERAL USE PLAN LAND USE PLAN AS WELL AND IN THE CITY OF LONG BEACH- AND ALSO WITH WITHIN THAT HAD A SPECIFIC PLAN AHEAD ZERO. REQUIREMENTS FOR AFFORDABLE. SO WE NEED TO DO A LOT OF WORK THERE AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU AGAIN AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING BUT I WILL BE SUPPORT TODAY. IF THERE ARE NO MORE IF THERE IS NO MORE DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S ALREADY SPOKEN CENTER WIENER YOU. CAN FINISH. INCLUDE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT BECAUSE I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU. ARE FOR THE DATE TODAY INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL. I THINK THE LENGTH AND THE THOUGHTFULNESS AND THE END OF NATURE. OF THIS DEBATE. BY SEARCHING FOR SO WHY I'M SO PROUD. TO BE A MEMBER OF THIS BODY- WE THIS IS A TEST- IT IS A VERY THOUGHTFUL. ON BODY AND PEOPLE WHO CLEARLY- UNDERSTANDS- THE BILL THAT WE'RE DEBATING AND I APPRECIATE THAT. BUT I JUST BRINGING THIS TO A VERYHIGH LEVE TO LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE. BY THE NUMBERS COULD NOT BE MORE STARK IN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE SHORT THREE THREE POINT FIVE MILLION HOMES IN CALIFORNIA. MILLIONS OF HOMES THIS IS IN A SMALL PROBLEM. THIS IS A MASSIVE PROBLEM. WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOMES PER CAPITA. OF HOW MANY HOUSING UNITS THE STATE HAS PERSONS HOW MANY PEOPLE LIVE IN NOT SAYING YOU DO A RATIO HOMES FOR CAPITAL. AND YOU RANK THE FIFTY STATES. CALIFORNIA IS NUMBER FORTY NINE. YOU T&lt;c.cyan&gt; IS THE&lt;/c&gt; ONLY ONE THAT'S- BELOW US AND UTAH HAS LARGER HOUSEHOLD SIZE IS THEY DON'T NEED AS MANY HOUSING UNITS THAT WERE ESSENTIALLY BOTTOM OF THE BARREL. WHEN IT COMES TO SIMPLY PROVIDING HOUSING FOR OUR POPULATION. HOW MANY LOOK AT HOUSING PRODUCTION TRENDS IN CALIFORNIA. IN THE EARLY SIXTIES WE WERE BUILDING BETWEEN. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND UNITS OF HOUSING A YEAR AS A STATE OF FIFTEEN MILLION PEOPLE. TODAY WE ARE STATE OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE AND WE'RE PRODUCING LESS THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND OR FEWER THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS OF HOUSING A YEAR. OUR POPULATION OVER SIXTY YEARS ALMOST TRIPLED OUR HOUSING PRODUCTION COLLAPSED BY ABOUT TWO THIRDS OR THREE QUARTERS ANYWAY YOU SLICE THE NUMBERS. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT WE NEED A DRAMATIC INCREASE. IN HOUSING OF ALL TYPES AND YES THAT INCLUDES SUBSIDIZE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THIS SB FIFTY WILL PROVIDE THE BASE ZONING AS A SENATOR FROM SAN DIEGO MENTION SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND I AM FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF EFFORTS SUCH AS A SENATOR FROM SAN JOSE TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE OUR PERMANENT FUNDING SOURCES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. YES WE NEED A TO USE AND WE'RE DONE GOOD WORK THERE BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH AND WE NEED TO ZONE OUR STATE PER AYE WE NEED HIS OWN CALIFORNIA. TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO BUILD ENOUGH HOUSING AND THAT'S WHAT SB FIFTY WILL DO AND WILL DO IT IN A WAY. THAT IT WON'T CREATE SPRAWL. THIS IS ABOUT REAL PEOPLE AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING. IT'S NOT ABOUT HIS NUMBERS AND STATISTICS. THIS IS ABOUT CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE HURTING RIGHT NOW WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO REPRESENT THEM. I'M A HUGE FAN OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT- I. THE FORMER LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIAL I TALKED TO MY- BOARD OF SUPERVISORS MEMBERS. CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS ALL THE TIME AND I'M ENORMOUS RESPECT FOR THEM. BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT MY CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS. AND SPORTS OF SUPERVISORS ARE NOT THE ONE WHO WANTS TO ELECTED OFFICE. AND SOMETIMES THEY DISAGREE WITH ME SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OPPOSES THIS BILL. THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE I'M SELECTED BY THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ELECTED THEM. I'M MY OBLIGATION IS TO THE MILLION PEOPLE. WHO ARE THE RESIDENTS OF MY DISTRICT AND SO YES OF COURSE CITY COUNCILS MATTER. BUT ULTIMATELY WE ARE HERE TO REPRESENT THOSE MILLION PEOPLE. WHO ARE SUFFERING RIGHT NOW MANY OF THEM AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. I'M SICK. KERRY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

SENATE BILL FORTY FIVE BY SENATOR ALLEN AN ACT RELATING TO A WILDFIRE PREVENTION SAFE DRINKING WATER DROUGHT CORPORATION AND FLOOD PROTECTION PROGRAM BY PROVIDING THE FUNDS NECESSARY THEREFORE THROUGH AN ELECTION FOR THE ISSUANCE AND SAFE SALE OF BONDS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND FOR THE HANDLING AND DISPOSITION OF THOSE FUNDS AND DECLARING THE URGENCY THERE OF TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. SENATOR ALAN THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS IF PASSED BY OUR VOTERS SB FORTY FIVE WOULD FIND ON THE GROUND PROJECTS DESIGNED TO HELP PREPARE FOR SEVERE WILDFIRES CATASTROPHIC FLOODS MUD SLIDES PROLONGED DROUGHTS EXTREME HEAT THE LEVEL RISE ANOTHER EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS WE'RE ALREADY SEEING AS A RESULT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. ACCORD OUR STATE'S FOURTH CLIMATE ASSESSMENT THE COST OF CLIMATE CHANGE FOR CALIFORNIA ALONE AS LIKELY TO BE OVER A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY WITHIN A COUPLE DECADES HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY I JUST WANNA REPEAT THE SIZE. OF THE CHALLENGE. I THIS BILL SETS A COURSE TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF RISING GLOBAL TEMPERATURES BY INVESTING IN MEASURES IN EVERY PART OF THE STATE TO PROTECT. CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES IN BILATERAL RESURCES FROM THESE RISKS. THE BILL THAT A CASE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING TO PROJECTS THAT REDUCE FIRE HE THE FIRE RISK NEAR COMMUNITIES ENSURE OUR FORESTS. ARE HEALTHY ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND MORE INTENSE WILDFIRES ACCORDING TO FEMA OUR FRIENDS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL EVERY DOLLAR INVESTED. IN ACTIVITIES TO PREVENT FIRES OR MITIGATE SEVERITY SAVE SIX DOLLARS IN RESPONSE COSTS. WARMING TEMPERATURES WILL ALSO INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF FLIGHTS GET OUR STATE IS CURRENTLY INVESTING LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT IS NEEDED TO PROPERLY ADDRESS THIS GROWING RISK WHICH IS ESTIMATED NOW TO BE MORE. THAN THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AND GROWING. SB FORTY FIVE DEDICATES FUNDING A PROJECT THAT WILL REDUCE THIS RISK BY SLOWING RUNOFF. IMPROVING GROUND WATER INFILTRATION AND PROTECTING COASTAL COMMUNITIES. FROM SEA LEVEL RISE. IN OUR URBAN COMMUNITIES EXTREME HEAT EVENTS CAN BE DEADLY ESPECIALLY FOR OLDER ADULTS YOUNG CHILDREN. PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC ILLNESS LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES. AND AS A RESULT THE BILL DIRECTS FUNDING TO HELP LOCAL COMMUNITIES ADAPT TO RISING TEMPERATURES BY REDUCE THE HEAT ISLAND EFFECT THROUGH. GREETING PROJECTS IN CAPTURING STORM WATER TO HELP STABILIZE DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES. THE MEASURE ALSO PROPOSES TO FIND PROJECTS TO RESTORE AND PROTECT. IMPACTED COASTAL RESOURCES IN FOR. FISH AND WILDLIFE POPULATIONS AS WELL AS IMPROVE THE RESILIENCY OF THE STATE'S WATER SUPPLIES. AGRICULTURAL LANDS. IT'S OUR STRONG SENSE THAT WE MUST TAKE CARE AGGRESSIVE PROACTIVE STEPS TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE IMPACTS. THAT WE KNOW ARE COMING WE KNOW ALREADY UPON US. THE BILL AS THE FORTY FIVE IS A FISCALLY PRUDENT STEP IN THAT DIRECTION I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. ADAM PRO TEM. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I- RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB FORTY FIVE WHEN WE FIRST CONVENE THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE WERE STRUGGLING WITH THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THE CAMPFIRE COMMUNITIES ACROSS OUR STATE WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF RECOVERY AND REBUILDING AFTER CLIMATE RELATED DISASTERS DEVASTATING FIRES MUDSLIDES FLOODING AND MORE I SAID THEN THAT RESILIENCE MUST BE A PRIORITY FOR THE SENATE AND IN MANY WAYS IT'S BEEN OUR PRINCIPAL FOCUS. FIGHTING WILDFIRES ENSURING THE RELIABILITY OF OUR ENERGY SYSTEM ENSURING ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER FOR EVERY CALIFORNIA DESERVE THE VERY REAL CHALLENGES OF CHANGING CLIMATE HERE AND NOW THIS BOND WILL GIVE US THE RESOURCES WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES BY ADDRESSING SEA LEVEL RISE PREVENTING WILDFIRES PREPARING FOR FUTURE DROUGHTS AND FLOODS AND PROTECTING OUR PRECIOUS WATER RESOURCES. IN ADDITION TO STATE WHAT FUNDING THAT WILL BENEFIT INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN EVERY PART OF THE STATE THERE'S ALSO LOCALIZED FUNDING TO EMPOWER FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES TO SECURE OUR MOST VITAL RESOURCES AND COLLEAGUES THE COMMUNITIES NEED THESE RESOURCES. THIS IS ONE AREA WHERE MANY OF THEM WOULD LIKE OUR SUPPORT SB FORTY FIVE REQUIRES THAT AT LEAST 35% OF ITS FUNDS BE SPENT TO BENEFIT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THIS IS THE FIRST AND BY FAR THE LARGEST SINGLE STATE OF NEW INVESTMENT FOR CLIMB RE. A. SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- TALK ABOUT EXISTENTIAL THREATS THE ONE THAT WORRIES ME THE MOST IS FISCAL DISTRESS- SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT TENURE PLANNER TWENTY YEAR PLANNER THIRTY YEAR STRATEGIC FINANCIAL PLAN THIS LEGISLATURE'S READING FROM- BUT- I'M I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED JUST WATCHING THE TRENDS THIS YEAR WE HAD A TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLAR QUOTE UNQUOTE SURPLUS. NEXT YEAR IS SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR. QUOTE UNQUOTE SURPLUS WITH THAT TREND WE WILL HAVE AN A DEFICIT OF FOURTEEN BILLION AND THEN THE FOLLOWING YEAR SO WHERE WILL THE MONEY COME FROM TO PAY FOR THE BONDS OUR POPULATION TRENDS ARE FLATTENING. TAXES ARE HIGHER THAN ALMOST EVERY OTHER STATE IN ALMOST EVERY CATEGORY A SO WE SURE THEY CAN'T RAISE TAXES MORE WE HAVE ANOTHER BOND MEASURE ON THE MARCH BALLOT AS WELL. SO WHAT WILL THIS LEGISLATURE CUT. TO PAY BONDHOLDERS. ENDING YEARS OF PLENTY WHY DOES THIS CAPITAL NOT PAY CASH INSTEAD WERE FORCING OUR TAXPAYERS TO PAY DOUBLE WITH PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. CALIFORNIA HAS THE LARGEST. AS THE SECOND LARGEST UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT IN THE NATION IT'S TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS JUST READ YOUR COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT. WE USUALLY END UP IN LAST PLACE FIFTY OF PLACEMENT. THIS YEAR. ENDED JUNE THIRTY. TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTEEN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY PUMP THIS OUT OF PLACE THEY ARE AT TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS COLLEAGUES ARE DEBT RATIOS ARE THE THIRD WORST AMONG THE TEN LARGEST STATES IN CALIFORNIA IS EDGED OUT BY NEW YORK IN ILLINOIS AND SPEAKING OF ILLINOIS IT'S UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT IS TWO HUNDRED NINE POINT NINE BILLION WE'RE NOT IN GOOD COMPANY. SO YOU'RE REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS ARE VERY OPTIMISTIC YES THE STOCK MARKET HAS RISEN ELECTED PRESIDENT BUT DO YOU REALLY EXPECT THAT TREND TO CONTINUE FOR THE REST OF OUR LIFETIMES I AM NOT HERE TO ARGUE THE MERITS OF THE USE OF THE BOND PROCEEDS I AM HERE TO ASK YOU QUIT IN COVERING CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. PAY OFF YOUR CREDIT CARDS FIRST ADDRESS THE DEFINED BENEFIT AND OTHER POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS UNFUNDED ACTUARIAL ACCRUED LIABILITIES SHOW SOME FISCAL PRUDENCE THEN TRY YOUR BEST TO PAY CASH AND THEN WERE ALL CUT UP THEN YOU IS TO BONDS THAT WE COULD HAVE A VERY SHOULD PERIOD OF TIME. YOU KNOW THIS THEY CAN'T EVEN MY ITS- AND WE HAD A RACE TO. FOR THAT WE GOT TO START BEING A LITTLE MORE. FISCALLY A WEARABLE WE'RE DO CALL BEFORE WE FIND OURSELVES HAVING A BUDGET THAT IS SO SQUEEZED. ACCORDINGLY I REQUEST THE NO VOTE ON SB FORTY FIVE. SENATOR GLAZER. THANK YOU ARE MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS. WHEN WE MAKE CHOICES ABOUT MEASURES LIKE THIS IT'S ABOUT SETTING PRIORITIES AND I THINK IF YOU WERE AT TO ASK THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA AND THIS WOULD PROPOSE TO DO THAT DO YOU THINK THAT WILDLIFE PREVENTION IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR OUR STATE BUDGET I THINK THE ANSWER WOULD BE YES AND YOU ASK THEM ABOUT DROUGHT PREPARATION WOULD THAT BE A HIGH PRIORITY BECAUSE WE HAVE TO SET PRIORITIES I THINK THE ANSWER WOULD BE YES AND SO AS YOU LOOK THROUGH THE PURPOSES OF THIS MEASURE. ON THE IT YOU KNOW THE LEGITIMATE QUESTION THAT'S RAISED BY THE SENATOR ROM ORANGE COUNTY I THINK THAT THIS IS A MATTER OF SETTING PRIORITIES READY GIVE THE VOTERS THAT CHANCE AND I THINK THAT THEIR ANSWER WILL BE. YES I WANT TO GIVE PRAISE TO THE AUTHORS. THEY SEEM TO BE OFF LOS. BACK IN THE SAME ABOUT THAT. BUT I WOULD NOTE THAT IN THE IN THE BILL IT DOES SET ASIDE ALLOCATIONS I AM PRIORITY AREAS FROM ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE DONE GREAT WORK IN OUR STATE HAVE PROVEN TRACK RECORDS CERTAINLY THE CONSERVANCY'S. BUT ALL I WOULD ASK- TO THE AUTHORS IS THIS BILL HOPEFULLY MOVES FORWARD TODAY. IS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE BALANCE I GEOGRAPHIC BALANCE IN IN THE WORK THAT WE DO THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT WE DO IN THIS BILL AND I HOPE THAT THAT WILL BE A PART OF THE WORK THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO DO- WHEN THIS WHERE THE MEASURE GOES FORWARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ENERGY AND I VOTE. SENATOR DRAWS OF. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB FORTY FIVE CLIMATE CHANGE IS INDEED DRAMATICALLY IMPACT IN OUR ECONOMY AND ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WILL BE MOST AFFECTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND ECONOMIC SHIFTS THAT IS WHY I WANT TO URGE THE AUTHOR TO GIVE GREATER PRIORITY TO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IN THESE PROJECTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES I BELIEVE WE NEED TO BE MORE INTENTIONAL AND EXPLICIT. IN OUR JOB COMMITMENTS IN OUR JOB CREATION AND CREATING PATHWAYS TO GOOD NEW CAREERS SB FORTY FIVE NOW HAS IS THAT A FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS MORE OR LESS- AND SIXTY MILLION ALLOCATED FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT I WOULD URGE TO INCREASE THAT ALLOCATION I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT HIGH QUALITY JOBS WILL BENEFIT ALL CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. SENATOR BILL. MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I SUPPORT THIS SO LEGISLATION AND THE BONDS AND URGED VOTERS TO APPROVE IT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS- WITHHELD FUNDS NOT SPENT FUNDS ON MANY OF THESE THINGS FOR MANY YEARS THIS IN MY OPINION IS BILLS PASSED DO. AND IN ORDER TO FINANCE THEM APPROPRIATELY THESE BONDS ARE IN ORDER I LIKE TO POINT OUT TO THE BOND RATING OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IN THE LAST THREE YEARS- ALL ONE HAS TO DO IS TO GO TO THE PUBLISHED CREDIT RATINGS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO SEE. HOW THEY VIEW BONDS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE CREDIT RATING IS IN A PRETTY GOOD SHAPE AND WILL GET MUCH BETTER AS WE GO ALONG. WHAT DOESN'T HELP OUR CREDIT RATING IF WE LET THINGS FALL APART. AND IT WITHOUT THESE BONDS ARE WITH I ARE THAT MANY MANY OF OUR ON NAY UNMET. PRIORITIES WILL CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE AND THUS BECOME MORE EXPENSIVE AND MORE COSTLY. PAY AS YOU GO IS NOT A GOOD OPTION LET'S FIND THE PROJECTS NOW. USING BONDS THAT WE CAN GET OUT OF A REVERIE RESPECTABLE INTEREST RATE AND COST. AND LET'S PROCEED AHEAD WITH THOSE PROJECTS THAT ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED TODAY NOT IN THE FUTURE BUT TODAY. AND HAVE BEEN LONG PAST DUE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARJUNA VOTE ON THIS MOTION. SENATOR STERN. AT THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT JUST SAY APPRECIATE THE SAN FROM COST CONTRA COSTA SANTOS AND FOR ON. CHOICES PRIORITIES IN FISCAL RISK- WE CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO PASS A MAJOR BOND THIS YEAR ON THIS FRONT. THE CREDIT RISK TO THE STATE OF NOT ACTING IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY TO HARDEN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE WILL LEAVE US EXPOSED TO BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF SURPRISES ESSENTIALLY. OVER THE NEXT DECADES YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN THE NEXT. ATMOSPHERIC RIVER IS COMING YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN THE NEXT FIRES GOING TO HIT YOUR COMMUNITY LAST YEAR WE GOT HIT. YOU COULD CALL IT OUT OF THE BLUE BY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO GO DEAL WITH ALL THE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. IF WE DON'T GET AHEAD OF THESE DISASTERS WE'RE GOING TO PAY FOR IT ON THE BACK AND- SO IT MAY SOUND TO YOU FIVE BILLION DOLLARS SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY OR FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IS A LOT OF MONEY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT JUST ONE INCIDENT. USGS A VERY CONSERVATIVE SOBRE FEDERAL GEOLOGIC SURVEY AGENCY MODEL SOMETHING CALLED THE ARK STORM. AND IT'S NOT A R. C. AS ARC STORM IT'S PARK IS IN NOVA NO WAS ARC STORM. IS IT IS SUPER FLOOD IS QUITE LIKELY OVER THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS. THAT WOULDN'T JUST COMPLETELY SINK. SACRAMENTO IN THE DELTA REGIONS AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT ALSO LOS ANGELES. ORANGE COUNTY DOWN IN THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY A SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR ALL OUT CATASTROPHE. IF WE DON'T START DOING THINGS LIKE HARDEN ARE LEVEES PREPARE FOR THESE FLOODS IT'S NOT JUST FIRES FOLKS SO I APPRECIATE THE GOOD WORK DONE BY EVERYBODY HERE TODAY- BUT THIS WORK PRODUCTS GOING AFTER OF ALL OF AS WE GO FORWARD. WE KNOW THE GOVERNOR HAS SOME IMPORTANT PRIORITIES WE LOOK FORTY HEARING WITH THIS THE ASSEMBLIES PRIORITIES- AND THE ONE THING I WOULD ENCOURAGE US ALL IS- DON'T UNDER DO IT. THE VOTERS ARE NOT INTERESTED IN INCREMENTALISM HERE. WE NEED A BOLD CHANGE SO IF IT'S A MATTER OF. WHETHER WE'RE SPENDING TOO LITTLE I THINK WE'VE ASKED OURSELVES THE WRONG QUESTION IT'S WHETHER WE'RE SPENDING ENOUGH. AND WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA MAKE PEOPLE SAFE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WE NEED TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT SCALE HERE. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I'VE- SENATOR ROTH. I THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT- IN A WILDFIRE PREVENTION SAFE DRINKING WATER DROP. PREVENTION PREPARATION FLOOD PROTECTION ROLE OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT VERY VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES TO- ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS IN THE STATE INTO THE STATE AS A WHOLE I PLAN ON SUPPORTING THE MEASURE I WOULD NOTE THAT THE MEASURE APPEARS TO INCLUDE SOME OPERATIONAL ITEMS FOR MANAGEMENT AND FOR PLANNING. IN ADDITION TO CAPITAL PROJECTS AND FRANKLY I PREFER TO BORROW AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IN THE BOND MEASURE BORROW FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS AND NOT BORROW FOR OPERATIONAL ISSUES SO. AS THIS MATTER MOVES FORWARD I WOULD ASK THAT THE AUTHOR TAKE A LOOK AT THAT- AND THE PROPRIETY OF ACTUALLY FLOATING A BOND. TO BORROW MONEY FOR OPERATIONAL ISSUES I THINK WE CAN PROBABLY. CUT THIS DOWN TO CAPITAL PROJECTS AND DO MUCH BETTER IN THAT REGARD SO URGENT AYE VOTE. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. CENTER GALGIANI. I'M I'M GOING TO BE WITH HOLDING MY VOTE TODAY I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE WORK OF THE AUTHOR BUT I WAS HERE AS A STAFF MEMBER IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WHEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED PROPOSITION ONE E. WHICH WAS FOR FLOOD PROTECTION. AND IN THAT BOND MEASURE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION. WE HAVE THE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED MILES OR SO OF LEVEES THAT ARE IN BOTH SACRAMENTO AND SALLY CAN COUNTIES AND SALAS CAN COUNTY TO THIS DAY IS STILL TRYING TO GET MONIES FROM PROPOSITION ONE E. THE MONEY IN THE BOND WAS TO REFER TO THE GENERAL FUND IF IT WASN'T SPENT. BY I BELIEVE TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN AND WHILE I WAS TRYING TO DO LEGISLATION TOOK SAID IN THAT TIME PERIOD SO THAT THE CENTRAL VALLEY COULD. USE THOSE FUNDS LEVY. AND STRENGTHENING THAT MONEY INSTEAD MUCH OF IT IF NOT MOST OF WHAT WAS HAVE WAS DIVERT GENERAL FUND BE I CAST MY VOTE ON THEIR I WANT A B. X. CLEAR ABOUT EGGS. WHERE THE MONEY IS GOING. HOW MUCH IS GOING TO THE PROTECTION THIS OF. BECAUSE ONLY TO VOTER AT THAT WHAT IT'S FOR.

IS FACT BEING IGNORE. NOW SOME FIVE YEARS LATER THINGS THAT WERE TO BE DONE. THERE'S AT THE LEAST IN AGENCIES O STATE GOVERNMENT A DRAGON OF HEELS. AND I CONSIDER THAT UNDER THE PRESSURE FROM VARIOUS AND SUNDRY SPECIAL INTERESTS. WE CANNOT KEEP PASSING BOND MEASURES. JUST AS WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IF YOU DO NOT SHOW YOUR LOCAL CITIZENS THAT YOU DID WHAT YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO DO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THESE THINGS. AND I'M- WARY OF DOING THE HARD WAY THAT WAS. THOUSANDS OF OUR THAT YOU. NEGOTIATING A THAT VERY MAJOR AND VERY IMPORTANT BOND. AND HERE THAT YOU CAN WATCH YEARS PASS. AND NOTHING HAPPENS. EXCEPT PREVARICATION AND THE LADY AND RESISTANCE. I'M NOT PREPARED TO VOTE NO BUT I'M CERTAINLY NOT PREPARED TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY AND I DO WANNA FLAG THE ISSUE WHEN WE VOTE FOR THINGS WE HAVE A RIGHT AN EXPECTATION AS MOST IMPORTANTLY DO OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AND GOVERNMENT THAT DOES NOT KEEP ITS WORD. IS NOT A TRUSTED GOVERNMENT. FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SING ON SENATOR ALLEN YOU MAY CLOSE.

SENATE BILL SEVEN FIFTY SEVEN BY SENATOR ALLEN AND ACTUALLY INTO STATE HIGHWAYS. MADAM PRESIDENT THAT SIR SB SEVEN FIFTY SEVEN MAKES OF A LITTLE CHANGE TO THE STATE HIGHWAY RELINQUISHMENT. PROCESS AND TO MAKE IT A BIT EASIER FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHO DESIRE TO MANAGE AND MAKE CHANGES TO A ROAD THAT NO LONGER SERVE THE PURPOSE OF A TYPICAL HIGHWAY THE BILL PROPOSES AN ALTERNATIVE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS PERMITTING THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. TO RELINQUISH PORTIONS OF THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM TO A CITY OR COUNTY WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE ACTION. NO MY INTENTION HERE IS NOT TO. ANY OBJECT THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY SYSTEM THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND SHOULD THE BOOK THE BILL BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY. I AM SO THE COMMITTED TO WORKING I CONTINUE TO WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS WHO WANT GREATER PARAMETERS AROUND THE SCOPE OF SECTIONS OF HIGHWAYS. THAT COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR RELINQUISHMENT UNDER. THE PARAMETERS OF THE BILL. I'M FOR EXAMPLE I I'VE YOU KNOW WE'RE BEEN WORK ONE OF ONE ARE CALLING TO ON ON A ON AN ISSUE ASSOCIATED WITH HER DISTRICT BUT FOR THOSE APPROPRIATE INSTANCES WHERE IT'S NOT PRACTICABLE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO WORK THROUGH. OUR STATE BUREAUCRACY TO MANAGE OR MAKE IMPORTANT CHANGES A LOCAL ROAD WHERE THEY ACTUALLY MAKE THE DECISION THAT THEY WANT TO TAKE CONTROL THE LOCAL ROAD IN THE STATE. MAKES A DECISION THAT THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE THING TO HAPPEN- THE BILL MAKES YOU DISHES BUT IMPORT IMPROVEMENTS THE CURRENT LAW. AND ALLOWS FOR THAT PROCESS TO HAPPEN THIS ULTIMATELY IS A WITH IT IS IT IS IT IS A MECHANISM FOR OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO. ACHIEVE IN A MORE EXPEDITED INJUDICIOUS MANNER- SOMETHING THAT MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES OF STRUGGLE WITH- WHEN IT COMES TO THIS INTERPLAY BETWEEN.
