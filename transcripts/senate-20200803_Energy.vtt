IS NOT ME IS NOT THE TO TIRE

00:36:55.813 --> 00:36:57.114
FOLK THIS. WE TO RE IS THAT IT

00:36:57.181 --> 00:36:58.583

00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:07.458
IT'S ALREADY IN. FOR FIVE

00:37:07.525 --> 00:37:09.994
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ON

00:37:10.061 --> 00:37:10.595
MILLION DOLLARS THE PEOPLE OF

00:37:15.466 --> 00:37:16.334
FIFTY WILL NEVER WE DON'T HAVE

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.102

EVERYBODY COVERED. AND I ALWAYS

00:37:19.971 --> 00:37:21.772
LOOK AT THESE THINGS IS THAT-

00:37:21.839 --> 00:37:23.841
WE NEED TO LOOK AT- GIVING THE

00:37:23.908 --> 00:37:25.643
BEST AND I THINK FARMERS A WAY

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:27.111
TO DO THAT IT'S GOING TO HELP

00:37:27.178 --> 00:37:29.513

GREAT- BUT WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT

00:37:33.451 --> 00:37:34.719
DON'T HAVE ANY SERVICE AT ALL

00:37:34.785 --> 00:37:37.188
RIGHT NOW THE IMPORTANT TO THIS

00:37:37.254 --> 00:37:38.990

THEM SERVE AND I DON'T WANT TO

00:37:42.093 --> 00:37:45.262
LEAVE ANYONE BEHIND SO THAT'S

00:37:45.329 --> 00:37:46.931
WHAT WE I'M GOING WITH THIS IS

00:37:46.998 --> 00:37:47.999
THAT ITS IMPORTANCE IS THE

00:37:48.065 --> 00:37:52.903

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:53.871
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THAT.

00:37:53.938 --> 00:37:56.474
BELIEVE SOMEBODY BUT- IT

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:57.108

PERMANENT CHANGE HI WOULD

01:51:56.209 --> 01:51:58.778
LIKELY NOT BE SUPPORTED EVEN

01:52:02.582 --> 01:52:05.819
THINK RIGHT NOW ESPECIALLY

01:52:05.885 --> 01:52:08.855
GIVEN THE COVERT PANDEMIC. AND

01:52:08.922 --> 01:52:10.723
OUR KNOWLEDGE THAT BAD INDOOR

01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:12.959
AIR QUALITY BAD CIRCULATION OF

01:52:13.026 --> 01:52:17.030
AIR IN IN INDOORS CAN FURTHER

01:52:17.097 --> 01:52:19.933
THE PANDEMIC BUT ADDITIONALLY

01:52:19.999 --> 01:52:23.603
WE KNOW THAT. IT IS UNHEALTHY

01:52:23.670 --> 01:52:25.071
BANDS THAT OUR SCHOOLS

01:52:25.138 --> 01:52:27.907
UNFORTUNATELY HAVE FOR WHATEVER

01:52:27.974 --> 01:52:32.278
REASON THE- EITHER THE DESIGN

01:52:32.345 --> 01:52:34.114
OR THE H. BACK SYSTEMS IN THEM

01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:37.450
WHAT HAVE YOU THE INDOOR AIR

01:52:37.517 --> 01:52:40.987
QUALITY LEVELS ARE BELOW ARE

01:52:41.054 --> 01:52:43.490
FOR ARE NOT. HEALTHY IN OUR
