BECAUSE OF STREET RACING WHICH

00:23:18.363 --> 00:23:18.864

PROBLEM AND RECKLESS DRIVING IS

00:23:21.032 --> 00:23:22.100

THIS BILL WE BELIEVE IS A

00:23:25.871 --> 00:23:27.239

RECKLESS DRIVING WHICH MEANS NOT

00:23:46.091 --> 00:23:47.159
JUST ROLLING A STOP SIGN OR

00:23:47.225 --> 00:23:49.361
MAKING A RIGHT WITHOUT LOOKING

WITHOUT SUCH A WANTON DISREGARD

00:23:52.297 --> 00:23:53.064

THAT MAKE IT A RACING VEHICLE

AND NOT STREET LEGAL AND IT'S

00:24:04.342 --> 00:24:05.343
THE FIRST TIME THAT THAT WOULD

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:06.278
BE IN LAW.

00:24:06.344 --> 00:24:07.179

00:24:08.713 --> 00:24:09.614
REMOVED.

00:24:09.681 --> 00:24:10.682
THERE'S A LOT OF OUTSOURCING

00:24:10.749 --> 00:24:12.083
PEOPLE WHO NEED THE CAR TO GET

SAFEGUARDS IN HERE TO PREVENT

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:19.925
HARDSHIP SOME PEOPLE BUT WHEN I

00:24:19.991 --> 00:24:21.059
SPEAK TO LAW ENFORCEMENT MY

00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:22.093
COMMUNITY WHAT THEY SAY IS THEY

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.063
ARE BUSTING THE SAME PEOPLE OVER

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:25.664
AND OVER AGAIN.

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:26.298
THEY'RE PAYING THE FINES BECAUSE

00:24:26.364 --> 00:24:27.232
THEIR NOMINAL WITH THEY REALLY

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:28.133
CARE ABOUT IS THAT TRICKED OUT

VEHICLE AND THEY HAVE SUGGESTED

00:24:29.901 --> 00:24:31.102
THIS IS A REMEDY TAKE THE CAR

00:24:31.169 --> 00:24:32.771
AWAY FROM THIRTY DAYS DRIVING IS

00:24:32.838 --> 00:24:34.773
A PRIVILEGE IT'S NOT A RIGHT.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.408
AND IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE BEING

00:24:36.474 --> 00:24:37.609
BAD BAD ENOUGH DRIVER THAT YOU

HAVE TWO CONVICTIONS FOR THIS WE

00:24:39.511 --> 00:24:40.312
THINK THAT IMPOUNDING THE CARPET

00:24:40.378 --> 00:24:41.913
THIRTIES MAYBE IS THE WAITED TO

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:46.418

HAS MORE VEHICLES MORE MOTORISTS

00:33:24.902 --> 00:33:26.337
ON THE ROAD THAN ANY OTHER STATE

00:33:26.404 --> 00:33:27.839
IN THE COUNTRY.

00:33:27.905 --> 00:33:30.541
AND ACCORDING TO THE MOST RECENT --

00:33:30.608 --> 00:33:31.442
SOME DATA.

00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:32.910
OUR STATE HAS THE GREATEST

00:33:32.977 --> 00:33:37.582
NUMBER OF BICYCLE -- THE

00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:38.950
COMMUTERS IN THE COUNTRY.

00:33:39.016 --> 00:33:39.751

00:33:40.918 --> 00:33:42.453
SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE

00:33:43.921 --> 00:33:45.723
OUT OF THIS POLICY MAKERS.

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:46.724
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS

00:33:46.791 --> 00:33:48.426
CONSISTENT WITH OUR FIRST EVER

00:33:48.493 --> 00:33:50.962
STATEWIDE PLAN. FOR ACTIVE MODES

00:33:51.028 --> 00:33:52.597
OF TRANSPORTATION A STATEWIDE

00:33:52.663 --> 00:33:54.999
PLANET WITH A GOAL OF THEM OF OF

00:33:55.066 --> 00:33:56.667
OF PROVIDING ALL CALIFORNIANS

00:34:02.473 --> 00:34:03.941
OPTIONS IT IS CERTAINLY A GOOD

00:34:04.008 --> 00:34:07.044
THING -- IT IS ALSO VERY

00:34:07.111 --> 00:34:08.913
IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY. TO

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.148
IMPROVING CREATE SAFE

00:34:10.214 --> 00:34:11.916
ENVIRONMENTS ENVIRONMENTS --

00:34:11.983 --> 00:34:12.917
THAT WILL ACCOMMODATE BOTH

00:34:12.984 --> 00:34:15.887
MOTORIZED TRAFFIC AND CYCLISTS.

00:34:15.953 --> 00:34:19.190
AND SO OVER TEN YEARS AGO I WAS --

00:34:19.257 --> 00:34:20.558
A PAY CALL FIREFIGHTER INSIDE

00:34:20.625 --> 00:34:23.928
OUT TO PAY CALL FIREFIGHTER FOR

00:34:23.995 --> 00:34:25.129
ABOUT SIX YEARS OF MY LIFE.

00:34:25.196 --> 00:34:25.863
IN THOSE TIMES I WAS ON DUTY AND

00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:26.731
HOW TO RESPOND TO A VEHICLE

00:34:26.798 --> 00:34:30.134
VERSE -- A PEDESTRIAN ACCIDENT.

00:34:30.201 --> 00:34:31.803
ALMOST EVERY SITUATION EVERY

00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:34.105
ACCIDENT I RESPONDED.

00:34:34.172 --> 00:34:35.106
TO HAD OCCURRED AT A TRAFFIC

00:34:35.173 --> 00:34:37.008
INTERSECTION.

00:34:37.074 --> 00:34:39.777
AND SO THIS EXPERIENCE MY TIME

00:34:39.844 --> 00:34:41.579
AS A PAY CALL FIREFIGHTER --

00:34:41.646 --> 00:34:42.713
MOTIVATED ME TO INTRODUCE HIS

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.015
BILL.

00:34:44.081 --> 00:34:46.050
I IN A MOTIVATED ME BECAUSE THIS

00:34:46.117 --> 00:34:46.684
BILL.

00:34:46.751 --> 00:34:48.719
ASSEMBLY BILL TOSS IT IS TWELVE

00:34:48.786 --> 00:34:49.720
SIXTY SIX WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO

00:34:49.787 --> 00:34:51.155
IMPROVE SAFETY.

00:34:51.222 --> 00:34:53.057
AND REDUCE CONFUSION FOR BOTH

00:34:53.124 --> 00:34:54.625
DRIVERS AND CYCLISTS WHEN

00:34:54.692 --> 00:34:55.827
APPROACHING TRAFFIC

00:34:55.893 --> 00:34:57.028
INTERSECTIONS.

00:34:57.094 --> 00:34:58.796
AND SO FOR MOST INTERSECTIONS IN

00:34:58.863 --> 00:35:00.364
OUR STATE BIKE LANES AND

00:35:00.431 --> 00:35:01.466
ABRUPTLY.

00:35:01.532 --> 00:35:03.568
THE END OF BROCCOLI UPON MERGING

00:35:03.634 --> 00:35:05.136
INTO THE ITH A RIGHT TURN LANE

00:35:05.203 --> 00:35:08.973
OR IN SOME CASES IF IT'S A ONE

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.107
WAY STREET A LEFT TURN LANE.

00:35:10.174 --> 00:35:12.410
AND SO WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO

00:35:12.477 --> 00:35:13.778
AND THE ANALYSIS STAFF TO

00:35:13.845 --> 00:35:15.213
FANTASTIC JOB AND TRY TO EXPLAIN

00:35:15.279 --> 00:35:16.747
IT SO BEAR WITH ME AS I TRY TO

00:35:16.814 --> 00:35:18.316
PAINT YOU A PICTURE.

00:35:18.382 --> 00:35:20.117
SO WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS IT

00:35:20.184 --> 00:35:21.819
WOULD PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

00:35:21.886 --> 00:35:24.722
WITH A TOOL WITH THIS NEW OPTION.

00:35:24.789 --> 00:35:26.791
A SAFER OPTION THAT WOULD ALLOW

00:35:26.858 --> 00:35:28.259
A SHARED AT LANE CONCEPT.

00:35:28.326 --> 00:35:31.295
AND THAT IS A RIGHT TURN LANE OR

00:35:31.362 --> 00:35:33.264
IN THE CASE OF A ONE WAY STREET

00:35:33.331 --> 00:35:35.533
A LEFT TURN LANE.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.502
THESE TURN LANES WOULD ALSO

00:35:37.568 --> 00:35:39.203
CONSIST OF A BY CALLING A BIKE

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:40.738
LANE THAT WOULD BE LOCATED ON

00:35:40.805 --> 00:35:41.906
THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF WHERE THE

00:35:41.973 --> 00:35:43.241
VEHICLE WOULD BE MAKING THEIR

00:35:43.307 --> 00:35:46.077
INTENDED TURN SO ON THE OUTSIDE.

00:35:46.143 --> 00:35:48.112
OF THE THE OUTSIDE PORTION OF

00:35:48.179 --> 00:35:50.581
THE LINE AND SO THIS THIS TYPE

00:35:50.648 --> 00:35:53.084
OF A DESIGN WOULD DIRECT DRIVERS

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:54.452
AND CYCLISTS ON SAFE PASSED

00:35:54.519 --> 00:35:55.953
THROUGH INTERSECTIONS.

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.321
SO CYCLIST TRAVELING THROUGH AN

00:35:57.388 --> 00:35:58.823
INTERSECTION WOULD BE GUIDED TO

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:00.658
TRAVEL ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF

00:36:00.725 --> 00:36:02.260
WHERE THE VEHICLE WOULD BE

00:36:02.326 --> 00:36:03.694
MAKING THEIR INTENDED TURN --

00:36:03.761 --> 00:36:06.397
AND SO THIS BILL -- WOULD

00:36:06.464 --> 00:36:08.232
FURTHER REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT

00:36:08.299 --> 00:36:10.334
TRANSPORTATION TO DEVELOP THE

00:36:10.401 --> 00:36:12.069
STANDARDS I BELIEVE -- THE

00:36:12.136 --> 00:36:13.371
STANDARD WOULD BE OR THE

00:36:13.437 --> 00:36:15.273
PROPOSED ENERGY IS TO HAVE THE

00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:17.275
PAVEMENT MARKINGS. TO IMPLEMENT

00:36:17.341 --> 00:36:18.809
THIS TOOL FOR A SAFER BY PLANE

00:36:18.876 --> 00:36:19.810
OPTION.

00:36:19.877 --> 00:36:20.978
THROUGHOUT OUR INTERSECTIONS IN

00:36:21.045 --> 00:36:23.080
THE STATE SO WITH THAT -- I

00:36:23.147 --> 00:36:25.816
APPRECIATE THE TIME STATURE.

00:36:25.883 --> 00:36:28.553
AND TO HAVE BILL SPONSORED.

00:36:28.619 --> 00:36:29.921
MY NAME IS DAVE SNYDER THE

00:36:29.987 --> 00:36:30.755

00:36:30.821 --> 00:36:32.823
CALIFORNIA BICYCLE COALITION

00:36:34.191 --> 00:36:35.626
IT WELL.

00:36:35.693 --> 00:36:37.461
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF FIXING A

00:36:37.528 --> 00:36:40.064
PROBLEM WHERE THE COMMON SENSE

00:36:40.131 --> 00:36:42.500
AND SAFE BEHAVIOR IS NOT

00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:44.602
PROVIDED GUIDANCE FOR AND IS NOT

00:36:44.669 --> 00:36:47.271
TECHNICALLY LEGAL THIS REQUIRES

00:36:47.338 --> 00:36:48.439
CALTRANS.

00:36:48.506 --> 00:36:49.840
TO BY DESIGN GUIDANCE SO THAT IT

00:36:49.907 --> 00:36:52.176
IT'S LEGAL AND SAFE TO DO WHAT

00:36:52.243 --> 00:36:53.878
MAKES SENSE WHEN A BIKE RIDER

00:36:53.945 --> 00:36:56.881
PARTISAN INTERSECTION.

00:36:56.948 --> 00:36:59.951
ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS UP.

00:37:00.017 --> 00:37:02.420
CAN I AS A QUESTION -- IN TERMS

00:37:02.486 --> 00:37:07.191
OF THE DESIGN -- ONE THING I'M A

00:37:07.258 --> 00:37:08.859
LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT BY BIKE

00:37:08.926 --> 00:37:11.228
THE BIKE LINES LANES IS.

00:37:11.295 --> 00:37:15.533
WHEN PEOPLE OPEN THEIR DOOR?

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:18.002
IF THERE PARK NEXT TO A BI PLANE

00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:19.937
AND THEY OPEN THE DOOR INTO THE

00:37:20.004 --> 00:37:21.539
BIKE LANE.

00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:23.975
IS THAT -- AN ACCIDENT ITS

00:37:24.041 --> 00:37:25.876
FREQUENT.

00:37:25.943 --> 00:37:27.078
IN TERMS OF CYCLISTS BEEN HIT BY

A DOORS IS.

00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:33.084
FROM FROM YOUR STANDPOINT.

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:34.619
I'M OF THE DESIGN WE'RE TALKING

00:37:34.685 --> 00:37:36.821
ABOUT HOW YOU DESIGN SAFE BY

00:37:36.887 --> 00:37:37.154
COINCIDENCE.

00:37:37.221 --> 00:37:38.422
I'M.

00:37:38.489 --> 00:37:40.024
REALLY SORRY TO SAY THAT YEAH

00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:42.560
IT'S A VERY FREQUENT ACCENT AND

00:37:42.627 --> 00:37:44.295
I I KNOW OF SOMEONE WHO.

00:37:44.362 --> 00:37:46.931
DIED IN SAN FRANCISCO -- ABOUT A

00:37:46.998 --> 00:37:49.033
MONTH AGO SWERVING TO AVOID THAT

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.968
VERY SITUATION AND GETTING RUN

00:37:51.035 --> 00:37:54.372
OVER BY A TRUCK IN THE LIKE THE

00:37:55.906 --> 00:37:56.474
OPENS THE THERE'S A BIKE LANE

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.309
NEXT TO THE PARKING SPACE ON THE

LEFT SIDE OF THE CAR.

00:38:01.278 --> 00:38:03.447
THEY OPEN THE DOOR.

00:38:03.514 --> 00:38:06.651
AND THEN THE BICYCLUS.

00:38:06.717 --> 00:38:08.619
HITS THE DOOR BECAUSE THE THERE

00:38:08.686 --> 00:38:11.422

IS OUTSIDE OF THE DESERT DOORS

00:38:17.928 --> 00:38:20.031
ZONE WHERE THAT CAN HAPPEN

00:38:20.097 --> 00:38:21.499
UNFORTUNATELY.

00:38:21.565 --> 00:38:23.601
MANY IF NOT MOST BIKE LANES ARE

00:38:23.668 --> 00:38:25.102
NOT ARE NOT.

00:38:25.169 --> 00:38:26.303
DESIGNED THAT WELL.

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:27.672
THERE'S ANOTHER SOLUTION AND

00:38:27.738 --> 00:38:28.406
WE'RE WORKING WITH YOUR
