I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF OF THE THROW BACKGROUND PAPER. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WILL BE BRIEF I WILL BRIEFLY HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS. I SINCE THE LAST CENSUS WHAT IF AMENDED JUNIOR LICENSE TYPES ONE OF WHICH INCREASED CONSUMER PROTECTION BY PROVIDING OVERSIGHT OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. ACCESS AND THE OTHER REMEDIES TO THE PUBLIC SHOULD ADAM WOULD BE HARMED BY A VETERINARIAN PRACTICING IN THE UNIVERSITY CENTER. IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE BOARD UNAPPROVED THE CALIFORNIA TECHNICIANS- I'M A REGISTERED VETERINARY TECHNICIANS AND IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE BOARD VOTED TO ELIMINATE THE CALIFORNIA STATE BOARD EXAMINATION OR THE MERITS. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS BILL THAT'S WHY THE POP- THE REASON WHY WE DO THIS WAS THAT POLITICS. WERE DEEMED READ. ZERO THE OTHER EXAMINATION THE NATIONAL EXAM THAT THEY HAVE TO TAKE- WE BELIEVE THAT REMOVING THESE UNNECESSARY BARRIERS TO LICENSURE WILL LIKELY INCREASE THE LICENSE POPULATION A RESULT IN INCREASED TAXES EVEN MEDICARE IN CALIFORNIA. NO GOOD DEED CN BE DONE WITHOUT DOING ALL THE PAPERWORK AND ELIMINATING THOSE EXAMS AS A RESULT OF THE BOARD IS SEEKING LEGISLATIVE ASSISTANCE TO REPEAL FIVE STATUTES AMEND FOR AB ONE TWO CONDENSED LESSEN YOUR- LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS SPEECH ONE STATUTES. THE LEGISLATIVE WAS PASSED THE BOARD WILL THEN REPEAL FIFTEEN REGULATIONS AND AMEND FIVE. ONCE FULLY IMPLEMENTED THESE PROPOSED CHANGES WILL SIGNIFICANTLY STREAMLINE THE LICENSURE PROCESS EIGHT DIFFERENT LICENSE TRANSACTIONS WITH JUST. ELIMINATING CONFUSION STRONG APPLICANTS. IN REGARDS TO RECIPROCITY REGARDLESS OF WHERE A VETERINARIAN GRADUATED RPG- WHAT THEY CURRENTLY HAVE AN OUT OF STATE- LICENSE ALREADY MINIMIZED APPLICATIONS WERE FILED ONE MORE COMPLICATION FOR THEIR INITIAL. LICENSE CURRENT PROCESSING TIMES TO THIS APPLICATION IS EIGHTEEN DAYS THE BOARD ANTICIPATES BEING ABLE TO REDUCE THAT TIME FRAME EVEN MORE WITH PENDING. SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS. IN RESPONSE TO AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT. THE REMOVED THE REQUIREMENT FOR. TO SCHOOL CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS WHICH OCCURRED MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS AGO EITHER INITIAL LICENSE LICENSING APPLICATION. THERE ARE LESS PROCESS- CAME THE FIRST YOU SEE A PROGRAM WITH THE FACT OF REGULATIONS. IMPLEMENTING AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT. GARCES CONTINUING EDUCATION THE BOARD HAS-COLLABORATED WITH THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PREMIER STATE COURTS TO UTILIZE THEIR NERO REGISTRY OF APPROVED CONTINUING EDUCATION WILL RAISE PROGRAM. WHICH LASTED TWENTY TWENTY. THE PROGRAM ALLOWS THE BOARD TO AUTOMATE C. E. THAT'S GENERATED COMPLIANCE REPORTS AND QUICKLY VIEW UNPACKS YOU REQUIREMENTS. ARE WE LAUNCHED THE FIRST CD OUT OF PROGRAM IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE BOARD RESTRUCTURED IT IS IMPORTANT UNIT IMPLEMENTED SEVERAL PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS WORK CLOSELY WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO STREAMLINE. IS AN ADDED. SIX LIMITED TURKEY FORTUNATE ANALYST. ANOTHER ENFORCEMENT. TO ADDRESS THE BOARDS FORTUNATE BACKLOG. WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON REDUCING UNNECESSARY BARRIERS TO LICENSURE. YOUR MIND THAT'S PROCESS AND PROVIDING BETTER SERVICE TO CONSUMERS UNLESS IT'S- I'LL WITH THAT WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MARKET AND- JUST AS A REMINDER THESE CHAMBERS ARE RELATIVELY LARGE AND IT'S DIFFICULT AS THERE MIGHT BE AN ECHO SO WE APPRECIATE YOUR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO SPEAK LOUDLY AND CLEARLY INTO THE MICROPHONE WHEN YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM ANY OF YOUR COLLEAGUES.

THE VETERINARY BOARD FOR CALIFORNIA AND- AND I TRULY BELIEVE OUR BOARD SYSTEM- AND DCA HAS IS SUCH A ENORMOUS PROTECTOR OF CONSUMER. OF CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S JUST AN HONOR TO SERVE. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH VICE PRESIDENT ELECT. I NEED ADDITIONAL OF COMMENTS FROM STE THE STAFF AT THIS TIME. ASCENA YES PLEASE. OTHER SCIENCE NOTHING. GREAT THANK YOU OKAY THEN WELL- TURN THE CONVERSATION TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- AND- THE INITIAL GOT A QUESTION FROM COMMITTEE AND THEN WE CAN GET TO ANY PUBLIC COMMENT SO ANY INITIAL QUESTIONS- FOR THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. WE BEGIN WITH SENATOR PAT. I THANK YOU CHAIR LOW AND- ACTUALLY SO IN THE- THE REPORT ACTUALLY KNOWS STUFF FIRST OF ALL AND REGARDS TO FREEZE IMPLEMENTATION IT LOOKS LIKE THE BOARD IS- WELL THE MOST RECENT ONE THAT YOU HAVE HERE IS FOR FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. BUT BASICALLY FOR ABOUT THE LAST FOUR YEARS THIS IS PAYING APPROXIMATELY. IN OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR FOR REASON AND IMPLEMENTATION- AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S YOU KNOW IT IT ONGOING YEARS AT HE SAME TIME WE ALSO SEE THERE'S BACKLOGS AND DESIRE FOR STAFF AND SO FORTH- AND I ASSUME THAT THAT ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE BACKLOG WHAT WAS ACTUALLY TWO THINGS ARE CITED STAFF IN BREEZE. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THAT ARE WE ARE WE THROWING MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN BY PUTTING REQUIRING THE BOARD TO SPEND SO MUCH MONEY ON BREEZE I MEAN THAT MOUNT OF MONEY YOU CAN BUY THESE PAPER TO STAFF PEOPLE. AND WE AND- IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S CONTRIBUTING TO YOUR BACKLOG SO CAN THERE BE A COMMENTS ABOUT- WHAT'S GOING ON WITH REASONS PATIENTS LIVES IT'S SO EXPENSIVE AND THE HOUSE THAT IMPINGING ON THE BOARD'S ABILITY. TO DO ITS JOB INITIATION. YOU ALSO WANT TO RAISE FEES. BECAUSE YOU NEED MORE MONEY AND YET WE'RE SPENDING THIS MUCH MONEY. ON GREASE AND SAID OF HIRING STAFF. TO DO MAYBE HELP DRESS THE BACKLOG SO- CAN CAN SOMEONE ADDRESS THAT. EVER PRESENT THAT TO. THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR JUST BECAUSE HE FOR ME THANK YOU. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION I THINK THE FIRST THING THAT I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT IN. GREECE IS ONLY GOING TO BE AS GOOD AS WHAT YOU PUT INTO IT AND I THINK I'M I CAME FROM ANOTHER BOARD IT FROM ONE OF A COMMON DREAM SPENT A LOT OF RESOURCES DESIGNED INCREASE. I'M AND I THINK WHEN COMING HERE AND THEN. ALTHOUGH EVERYBODY IS USING THREE ZERO USING PER USE DIFFERENTLY AND SO WHAT I FOUND IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF. DESIGN ISSUES OR COMPLICATIONS BUT WITH THIS BOARD ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE LICENSING SIDE OF IT I THINK THAT. THERE ARE A LOT OF. OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PRE SYSTEM AND WE SPENT THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF REALLY CORRECTING A LOT OF THE- ISSUES WITH WITH THE BREEZE SYSTEM. I'M AYE SO I DON'T. THINK THAT WERE WASTING MONEY WITH THE MONEY THAT WE'RE PUTTING INTO THREE. I THINK THAT WITH ALL OF THE ENHANCEMENTS THAT WE'RE WE'VE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED AND THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY. WORKING ON IT WILL STREAMLINE THE PROCESS A LOT MORE FOR THE LICENSEES. AND FOR OUR STAFF. OKAY WELL I GUESS- JUST AND FOLLOW UP JUST SAY THAT- I'D LIKE TO SEE AT LEAST BASICALLY LOOKING AT THESE DOCUMENTS AS YOU LIKE BREEZES MORE PROBLEM THAN A HELP HOWEVER- IF THERE IS. A REPORT YOU CAN PROVIDE IT SHOWS-ME HOW BREEZE ACTUALLY SAVES US MONEY AND ALSO HELPS LOWER LICENSING FEES WHICH ARE FORTUNATE KEEP GOING UP- THAT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL MUCH BETTER BUT SO FAR BASED ON AT LEAST. JUST PUTTING ST DIFFERENT PARTS OF THIS REPORT TOGETHER. IT SEEMS LIKE YOU NEED MORE HELP. YOU'RE CHARGING MORE FEES AND YET THE SAME TIME. YOU KNOW WE'RE SPENDING THIS MUCH MONEY I MEAN WE'RE JUST NOT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE QUARTER MILLION A YEAR FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON YOU KNOW THAT'S UP TO NINETEEN TWENTY CELLS- AND- YEAH. I MEAN I SINCE BEING BORN DISCUSSES BEING BORN BODIES- LICENSE HOLDERS RIGHT IT'S NOT WE'RE NOT USING GENERAL FUND REVENUES. SO AND I WON'T GET INTO THE LONG SORDID HISTORY OF BREEZE. BUT IT IT REALLY IS TROUBLESOME TO ME THAT YOU'RE SPENDING THAT MUCH MONEY FOR WHAT MAINTENANCE AGREES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND COLLEAGUES THAT YOU HEARD THE TERMINOLOGY BREEZE. OFFERED IN A NEWER MEMBERS THAT'S WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS THAT I. T. IN TECHNOLOGY- THAT THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT. CHALLENGES WITH AS YOU CAN- UNDERSTAND I T. IS NOT THE STRONG SUIT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WOULD YOU OF THE OBSERVER SENATOR PAN IS QUESTIONING A WITH RESPECT TO THE INVITATION AND THE VALUE. ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AND AGAIN- IT IS OUR OBLIGATION AND DUTY AS THIS COMMITTEE ON THE OVERSIGHT. FOR THE APPROPRIATE QUESTION THAT SENATOR PAN. I JUST ASKED. THEN MOVING ON TO THE NEXT QUESTION BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER TIM GRAYSON. IF THANK YOU SIR HELLO AND- ALONG SAME LINES- THERE IS THE PROPOSAL TO RAISE FEES. HOWEVER OTHER WAYS THAT WE COULD- REALIZE SAVINGS IN LIEU OF RAISING FEES. ONE OF THOSE. AREAS THAT I SEE WAS ACTUALLY IN THE PRESENTATION ABOUT. COMBINING AT AN EXAMINATION. OR THE ELIMINATION OF ONE. ARE THERE GOING TO BE SAVINGS REALIZED FROM. BRINGING THOSE EXAMINATIONS TOGETHER WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO ADMINISTER A SECOND EXAM. AND IF THERE ARE SAVINGS COULD THOSE SAVINGS GO. TO- HELPING REDUCE THE INCREASE REDUCE THE INCREASE OF PLEASE. DOCTOR DANI. SPEAK TO BE OF BUT AS FAR AS THE PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS I THINK THAT. I CAN'T PROMISE THAT WE CAN REDUCE EASE THE WHAT PROMISES A BETTER SERVICE- I CAN PROMISE THAT A LOT OF THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN ALREADY IT HELPS AREN'T LICENSING CYCLE TIMES. I IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER IT TLKS ABOUT HOW AND AT WHAT POINT IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY WITH MY STAFF WAS UNABLE TO PROCESS APPLICATIONS UNTIL AFTER EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY WEEKS THAT'S ONLY COUNTING THE TIME IT TOOK STAFF TO. TOUCH THAT APPLICATION FROM THE TIME CAME INTO THE DOOR SO WE ACTUALLY NOW HAS AND I'M LAST MONTH WORK WERE PROCESSING APPLICATIONS IMPROVING THEM WITHIN SIX TO SEVEN WEEKS I'M FOR THE INITIAL LICENSE APPLICATION BECAUSE OF A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE ALREADY REALIZE. WHAT PROCESS THE MOST INITIAL APPLICATIONS WITHIN TWO AND A HALF WEEKS SO WE ALREADY HAVE REALIZE A LOT AND EFFICIENCIES WE ALSO PLAN ON AND WE'RE WORKING RIGHT NOW ON YOUR FACE WITH THE NATIONAL EXAMS. I'M WITH HI CD IN AB SP TWO- AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFERRED BY. EXAM SCORES INTO OUR SYSTEM LIMITING AND NOT A LOT OF THE PROCESSES THAT ARE HAPENING AND WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON AND MOVING MORE PEOPLE TO RENEW ONLINE ONE OF THE BIG THINGS EVEN THOUGH WE'VE BEEN. LIVE IN BREEZE FOR FOUR YEARS NOW AND HE WILL LAUNCH IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND- BY THE BEGINNING OF TWENTY NINETEEN MOST OF THE APPLICATIONS WERE STILL KEEPER AND SO IN TWENTY TWENTY WE- WANT TWENTY MILLION TWENTY NINETEEN WE LAUNCHED AN ONLINE CAMPAIGN. AND NOW IN IN TWENTY TWENTY OR TWENTY ONE WE'RE LOOKING AT 99% OF THE AND THE WHAT THE CASE IS BEING REVIEWED ONLINE FOR VETERINARIANS AND IS ALL OF THESE ISSUES THAT WE'RE WE'RE BUILDING INTO THE SYSTEM. IT'S SIMPLISTIC NIKOLAY IMPROVING. THAT THE BACKLOG THAT WE HAVE. I WOULD LIKE ADD TO THAT- READ. WHEN ARE LOCATED LIKE THEY WERE. THERE IS SOME THEY- IT MIGHT BE DON'T TO PAY PREPARE THOSE. EXAMINATION BUT THERE'S ALSO REVENUE. THAT IS LOST. BECAUSE WE NO LONGER. THOSE FROM THE- APPLICANTS TO TAKE THE EXAM. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT WE- ISSUES EXAMINED. FOR THE PURPOSE OF RAISING MY NAY THE SOLE PURPOSE OF THE EXAMINATIONS. IN SHORT THE UP. AND RECEIVED EDUCATION CLINICAL EXPERIENCE SHE WANTS TO BE A VETERINARIAN WELL BEING RBG UNSUPERVISED. SO THAT THEY DON'T. THE MAY POSE A RISK THE CONCERN. SO YOU CAN THE- WE FELT THAT THE NATIONAL EXAM. SITUATION PLAYED THAT WASN'T A NEED OR STATE EXAM I WAS THE SOLE REASON WHY ABOUT THE. PART OF THAT OR THE FEE PART OF THAT HE WASN'T HARD TO DISCUSS THERE'S PLENTY OF REASONS WHY- OUR BUDGET WAS CHALLENGED IN THE REASONS WHY WE HAVE TO. THIS ARE THE FEES- BASIC- SYSTEM STAFF SALARIES BENEFITS OFFICE- THE SIMPLE THINGS LIKE THAT- WE ALSO HAD TO DEAL WITH SOME RACES FROM THAT J. GENERAL'S OFFICE- I THINK THERE ARE FEES FOR ATTORNEYS WAS RAISED BY 30% AND THEIR FEES FOR- PARALEGALS REYES FIVE SEVENTY ONE PERCENT- THOSE WERE BEYOND OUR CONTROL AND LEAD TO THE REASONS WHY WE HAD TO RAISE THE FEES. I'D ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT- WE DIDN'T MAKE THE DECISION ON OUR OWN WELL INCREASE FEES WERE BASED OFF OF A- THIRD PARTY AUDIT THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS- WHEN WE HAD TO DO TO MAKE OUR FIND. NOT A LOT OF FUN TO BECOME INSTALLED BECAUSE WE HAVE A LEGISLATIVE MANDATE TO KEEP OUR FIND OF A CERTAIN LEVEL NOT FALL BELOW THAT LEVEL- THE WAY I'M- I THINK THAT'S ABOUT. HOPEFULLY SUFFICIENT ACCESS YOUR QUESTION ON THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NEXT UP IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER VINCE FONG. THANK YOU CARILLO I COULD JUMP TO- TO ISSUE FOURTEEN MEGABYTES ANIMAL SHELTERS- I'VE HEARD FROM MY LOCAL- ANIMAL SHELTERS- THAT IT APPEARS THAT THESE- POTENTIAL REGULATIONS COULD HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES- OF PUTTING WHO YOU KNOW SMALLER ROLE SHELTERS IN AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION. AT A TIME OF- YOU KNOW OF TREMENDOUS BUDGET CONSTRAINTS NOW OF- FACING A PROFIT THING- AND COUNTIES AND CITIES- AND OF COURSE- THE EXISTING VENTURERS IS THERE- I LIKE TO GET YOUR COMMENTS ON THAT AND IF THERE WAS A CHANCE TO REVIEW THESE REGULATIONS WITH MORE INPUT FROM- FROM ANIMAL SHELTERS. HI GOOD MORNING THIS IS KATHY MILLER AND ALL ANSWERED I'LL TRY AND ANSWER THAT- JUST TO CLARIFY ANIMAL SHELTER AND FIRST OF ALL THE REGULATIONS ARE VERY EARLY IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW I BELIEVE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN- SUBMITTED TO DCA FOR REVIEW AT. SO YES THERE IS AMPLE OPPORTUNITY THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS FOR MORE INPUT AND- FROM ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT- BUT A LITTLE BACKGROUND ON IT CURRENTLY ALL FACILITIES TO PROVIDE VETERINARY CARE ARE STATUTORILY REQUIRED TO BE REGISTERED WITH THE BOARD AND IDENTIFY CALIFORNIA LICENSED VETERINARIANS ARE LICENSING MANAGER- SO THEY ARE ALL CURRENTLY HELD. ALL SHELTERS ARE CURRENTLY HELD TO THE MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR FACILITY RIGHT NOW. OF WHAT THESE EXIST AND WHAT THESE PROPOSED REGULATIONS THAT THE BOARDS HAS DEVELOPED- WHICH WAS AFTER. SEVERAL YEARS BY FIVE YEARS NOT SINCE I'VE BEEN ON THE BOARD OF HEARINGS- INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS- THROUGH OUR MDC. ARE THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS ACTUALLY HOPE TO REDUCE THOSE MINIMUM STANDARDS ARE RELAXED THEM FOR SHELTERS SEEING THAT SOME SHELTERS ARE HAVING HAVE ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS. WITH COMPLYING- AND YOU MENTION VETERINARY SHORTAGES AND WHATNOT- AND WE TOOK ALL THAT INTO CONSIDERATION IN THE STATE IN THESE PROPOSED REGULATIONS- SO THAT CURRENT THE MDC- TOOK A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WITH A LOT OF STALLS DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS IN THE SHELTER COMMUNITY AS WELL AS OUR VETERINARIANS AT LARGE. AND IT TO COME UP WITH THESE REGULATIONS ARE AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF SHELTER INPUT DURING THAT TIME OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE MORE OPINIONS OUT THERE AND WE WANT TO INCLUDE ALL OF THOSE- BUT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT. THE MINIMUM STANDARDS BOB FOR ALL ANIMALS IN SHELTERS OR OTHERWISE I NEED TO BE. NEED TO BE YOU KNOW HELP TWO EIGHT ARE FAIRLY HIGH STAY- THE WRITTEN OR THE WAY THE REGULATIONS ARE WRITTEN NOW ALLOWS FOR VETERINARIANS. TO WRITE UP ORDERS SO THAT- THE STAFF ON SITE THE R. B. T. OR THE AND BETTER NERI SYSTEM. CAN AND MINISTER VACCINES- THEY CAN ADMINISTER PARASITE PREVENTION- CLINICAL- CLINICAL- I MEAN I'M SORRY- CLINICAL CONDITIONS- TO TREAT. AND THINGS LIKE THAT WITHOUT OF THAT BEING ON SITE IF THOSE STAFF ARE WORKING UNDER THE ORDERS THAT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN- SO WE WOULD LIKE WE WELCOME MORE EMPLOYED IT'S EARLY IN THE PROCESS WE UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME SHELTERS OUT THERE- THAT ARE STILL HAVING DIFFICULTIES WITH EVEN BEES. BUT WE HOPE THAT- DURING THEIR- ABOUT PUBLIC OPINION WE WILL CONTINUE TO REFINE THESE BUT WE FELT THAT THIS WAS A WAY TO RELAX THEM FOR ITS FOR SHELTERS THEY CAN'T FLY RIGHT NOW. IS LAW IS RIGHT NOW THAT THEY- IS KIND OF UNIFORM- AND- IF- WE NEED TO CONSIDER OTHER THINGS WILL DO THAT BUT THAT'S THE- BACK OF THE CHAPTERS I WILL SAY THAT DURING THAT WHOLE- M. D. C. CHARING CROSS- SHELTERS WERE. FAIRLY WELL REPRESENTED ARE R. RV T. ON OUR OWN ON OUR BOARD WAS A SHELTER RBG AT THE TIME. AND THERE WAS A SHELTER VETERINARIAN- ON THE RBT ON THEM IN DC AT THE TIME. SO WE TRIED TO INCLUDE- TESTIMONY AND INPUT FROM ALL. ALL SOURCES. SO THAT'S AND MARK YOU MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD OR JESSICA BUT THAT'S SORT OF THE BACKGROUND ON THESE REGULATIONS AND AGAIN THERE EARLY IN THE PROCESS. I WOULD I WORK AT THE. A QUARTER CAN REGULATES THE PRACTICES THAT AMERICA'S. I ON THE ISSUE OF MINIMUM STANDARDS UP THE REASON WHY WE HAVE MINIMUM STANDARDS IS. I ASSUME THAT ALL OF YOU HAVE PETS AND- WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR PET TO THE VETERINARY HOSPITAL IT'S BECAUSE OF MINIMUM STANDARDS THAT- THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS FOR THAT THE TALK ABOUT PREVIOUS VISITS PREVIOUS MEDICAL CONDITIONS WHEN YOU'RE TAKEN INTO THE EXAMINATION ROOM WONDER IF THAT'LL HAPPEN AGAIN. THE EXAMINATION ROOM IS CLEAN- THE NEED ALSO TELL YEARS FOR GIVING INJECTIONS OURS STERILE. ALEX THE YEARS OR THE ASSEMBLY. STANDARD IF MINIMUM STANDARDS WE'RE IN PLACE THEN IT WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE CONSUMER. PREVIOUSLY THERE WAS ONLY ONE SET OF MINIMUM STANDARDS BUT DEFINITELY TIMES HAVE CHANGED PRACTICE ACT CHANGES EVERY YEAR AND WE REALIZE THAT THERE'S DIFFERENT TYPES OF PRACTICES THE PROBABLY WOULD REQUIRE DIFFERENT TYPES OF STANDARDS. IN PARTICULAR SHELTER MEDICINE WE DEFINITELY REALIZED THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE WHEREAS- REVENUE THE ABILITY JOB FULLY STAFFED- THEIR PRACTICES- BEING IN RURAL AREAS NOT HAVING. A VETERINARIAN BROWN'S JERSEYS AND SO. WE LOW INTEREST- TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO PRACTICE VETERINARY MEDICINE. BLACK WHEN DEALING WITH CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A POINT WHERE BOTH SIDES JUST. HAVE DISAGREEMENTS- WE CERTAINLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR THE SHELTER MEDICINE. BECAUSE THESE SHELTERS ARE NOT ONLY FULL ABANDONED PETS WITH NO OWNERS SOMETIMES THE SHELTERS ARE FILLED WITH THAT'S THE HAMBURGERS AND- CONTRABAND OF ONE OF MY OWN PETS LOST AND ENDED UP IN A SHELTER. I WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE THAT THERE WERE SOME MINIMUM STANDARDS PRESENTS AT THAT SHELTER SO THAT MIGHT HAVE MY CHILD. WOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF- I KNOW THAT IT'S DIFFICULT WHERE WHERE SOME OF THEM THE SMALLEST. TO ME. EVEN THESE MINIMUM STANDARDS AND OF COURSE WILL ALWAYS CONTINUE TO ACT IN GOOD FAITH HE TRIED TO REACH UP SOMETHING THAT WORKS FOR ALL OF US. BUT AS AS A REGULATORY BODY I THINK IT'S OUR DUTY TO HAVE SOME MINIMUM STANDARDS IN PLACE. IN THE SHELTERS. HI I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE- THE CANDOR AND AS SOMEONE WHO IS WHO HAS TO RESCUE DOGS MYSELF I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE- THE NEED TO FOR ANIMAL SAFETY AND TO ENSURE- THE LEVEL OF CARE FOR OUR FOR OUR PETS- MY- MY JOB MY GENERAL CONCERN IS JUST THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF. MAYBE A REGION THAT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH VETERINARIANS OR THIS OR THAT THAT. THE POTENTIAL OF THE POSSIBLE AND THESE NEW REGULATIONS BEING TOO RESTRICTIVE OR TOO COSTLY THAT MAY END UP. THE FOURTEENTH AIR SHELTERS TO EITHER- CLOSER TO REDUCE- THE RIPPING OF REDUCE ACCESS. TO TO THE COMMUNITY SO I GUESS IF YOU COULD JUST CLARIFY- I HEARD THE BEGINNING AND THAT THERE'S SOME ROOM FOR IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL. CLARIFICATION WHAT IS THE PROCESS MOVING FORWARD AND WHERE WOULD- ANY POTENTIAL REVISIONS OR ADDITIONAL INPUT BE ADDED OR INCLUDED OR PROVIDED. THROUGH THIS PROCESS. WELL I MEAN IN REGARDS TO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND THAT DEFINITELY ISN'T. THAT'S YOUR YOUR POINT IS ONLY ONE EXAMPLE OF AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE. AND I BELIEVE THAT A LOT OF RESCUERS START OFF WITH GOOD INTENTIONS BUT SOME OF THEM INTO SITUATIONS WHERE X. ANIMAL HOARDING. AND THERE ARE DEPLORABLE CONDITIONS- SO EFFECTIVELY REMOVE ALL STANDARDS. EVEN THOUGH SOME. RIGHT RESTORED WITH THE BEST INTENTION SOMETIMES THEY TURN INTO. DEPLORABLE SITUATIONS OF. ANIMAL HOARDING AND ANALYTICS- IF THE ON THE POSSIBLE OF WHICH WORK ON. IS UTILIZING REGISTERED BUT CHECK. ZERO- HELLO ESTABLISHED PROTOCOLS BECAUSE HAVE BEEN MADE BY A VETERINARY THAT PERHAPS IS NOT THERE FOR TIME BLACK CHECKS ON THE FIRST. THEY ONCE A WEEK OR ONCE A UP COUPLE OF WEEKS- THE PROTOCOL IS THAT'S AND FOLLOWED THE- THINK LIKE THAT THERE'S PLENTY OF WERE THE STANDARDS CAN BE MADE. MORE TO ABOUT TWO AREAS THAT HAVE LESS RESOURCES. SAYS ON LET ME JUST MAKE I AYE SIR DON'T- THE DISPUTE NEED FOR. SOME TYPE THE MINIMUM. CERTAINLY I MY CRANKING ANIMALS AND BIG FOR THE- TO PROVIDE A HIGH LEVEL. FOR ANIMALS IN MY CAN. I GUESS I IN TERMS OF SINCE I HEARD FROM THE FOR SPEAKER- THAT THEY THAT THE PROPOSED REGULAR HAVE A BEEN SEEN YET SO IS THERE A- I GUESS THAT'S MY QUESTION IS THERE CAN STILL TO REFINE AND HONE IN ON A LOT OF THE- MAYBE THESE CONCERNS NOW. ESPECIALLY AS WE GATHER NEW INFORMATION- LOOK WE'RE IN A RECESSION- A COUNTIES AND CITIES- ARE HAVE BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AND SILVER POSING COSTLY- THE POTENTIALLY COSTLY REQUIREMENTS THAT THAT YOU KNOW. THE CITY SHELTER A COUNTY SHELTER NOW HOSTAGE TO- TO RECONCILE THAT'S MY CONCERN IS THERE A WAY TO US RIGHT NOW TO. STILL SHAPE. THIS- THIS PROCESS. YEAH SO I'LL JUMP IN REAL. AND SO A COUPLE THINGS. WITH THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE REGULAR IN THE CLAIM THESE ARE YOU ARE IT MORE COST. AND WILL HAVE AN QUOTE. WHATEVER CON ARE ON OR AN FUNDS. I'M THOSE ARE ARE AND THEN FOR EXISTING LAW BECAUSE STATUTE STEM CELL. ARE CLEAR THAT IT YOU PRACTICE VETERINARY THEY TO BE BY. AND I THINK THAT THE- REALIZE AND WHEN FROM PUBLIC ON THE SEQUEL. IS THAT THE- STATE ARE ALREADY REALLY DID FOR SAID WITH AS A THAT'S WHY THE BOARD SPENT ABOUT FIVE YEAR. TRY TO FIGURE WAYS TO LOWER AND READ. THE BURDEN ON THE SHOULDERS TO COMPLY. AS FAR AS TIME FRAME THOUGH THOSE. I AS A CONTROLLING YOU KNOW THE MAKING IS NOW A QUICKLY. I AND THERE'S AMPLE TO THE- TO PROVIDE HOME COM. AND SO THE BIGGEST PORTION THAT IS ONE IT GOES THROUGH THE INITIAL YOU STAGING YES. IT'LL HAVE A FORTY FIVE PUBLIC PERIOD WHERE THE WILL. COLLECT ALL ALL COMMENTS FROM THE- WILL BE ABLE TO YOU ALSO. REQUESTED IN NEED BE WILL COLLECT CALL. AND IT WAS TO THE BOARD AND THE BOARD WILL DECIDE WHETHER NINETY TO AND THEN THE RIGHT. OR IF THEY WANT TO. PROVIDE SOME RESPONSES TO ALL THE COMMENTS. AND WILL BE DONE THROUGH THE MEETINGS AND- SO IT'S UNCOMMON US IN THE MAKING. TO NOT ONLY HAVE A FORTY FIVE DAY PUBLIC PERIOD AT THE BOARD FEELS THERE'S MY- THAT ARE NEED. FOR THE PROCESS. WHEN THERE'S A FOR AS WELL SO TO KNOW THAT FIVE DAY PER COMMENT IN COULD BE A FIFTEEN DAY BOB TAX. COLLECTOR. THERE IS SO THE BOARD HAS APPROVED THE REGULATIONS RIGHT NOW THEY'RE ON MY- TEAM ARE WORKING ON. PUTTING TOGETHER THE INITIAL STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR IT. WILL RING YOU WHAT DO YOU CA. STILL THE INFANCY STAGES OF THAT YES THE BOARD HAS APPROVED THE INITIAL LANGUAGE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT'S GOING TO BE THE FINAL. I APPRECIATE THEM AND- COURSE- WE'RE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT OUR LOCAL SHELTERS IN AND OUR LOCAL ANIMALS AND SO IF. THERE'S A WAY TO FOR A STAKEHOLDERS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INPUT AND CONTINUE TO REFINE THIS I CERTAINLY WOULD APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG SENATOR HER TADO. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THE FIRST ONE- DEALS WITH THE D. E. C. I WANTED TO JUST GET MORE BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON- IT TO WHAT EXTENT THAT IT BACK TO US. ABUSE ISSUE EXIST WITHIN WITHIN THE PRACTICE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND THEN ALSO HAVE SOME OTHER QUESTIONS REGARDING CAN CONTINUE IN EDUCATION AND SCHOOL APPROVAL PARTICULARLY- I KNOW THERE'S KIND OF BEEN A SHIFT AND BETTER. EDUCATION TOWARDS A ONE HEALTH APPROACH IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION THAT THE BOARD IS HAVING AROUND THIS CONCEPT. AND- BEING BACK THAT MORE MORE IT'S BEEN SEEN VAX- BETTER PLAY A KEY ROLE IN IN PREVENTING THE FUTURE PANDEMICS- CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT. SO TO BE ANSWERED BOTH QUESTIONS FIRST YOU ASK QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE DC AND THE BEST A DIVERSION AND EVALUATION COMMITTEE AND WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING OVERSIGHT OVER THE INDIVIDUALS WHO SUFFER HER INTO OUR DIVERSION PROGRAM. AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT IT'S A REALLY CRITICAL PROGRAM FOR THOSE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING SUBSTANCE ABUSE WHEN IT COMES TO THIS HEALTHCARE PROFESSION I THINK ONE THING THAT. THAT MAKES IT STAND APART FROM OTHER HEALING ARTS PROFESSIONS IS THAT MODERN% AREA AND I HAVE THE ABILITY TO WRITE THE PRESCRIPTIONS AND THEY MOST OF THEM DISPENSED RIGHT FROM THEIR SITES AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES EASY ACCESS. I'M RIGHT THERE AND SO IF THEY'RE EXPERIENCING SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND CHALLENGES THEN IT'S REALLY EASY FOR THEM TO. TO YOU ACCESS THOSE MEDICATIONS AND SO WE FEEL THAT IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT PROGRAM. UNFORTUNATELY IS A VERY COSTLY PROGRAM FOR THE BOARD AS WELL AND SO WE WOULD LIKE TO DO SOME OUTREACH AT. EIGHTEEN TO ENCOURAGE MORE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS VALUABLE PROGRAM BUT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW AND AFFORD IT AND SO WE ARE LOOKING AT WHAT OTHER BOARDS ARE DOING THAT HAVE DIVERSION PROGRAMS THAT USE MAXIMUS THE WE TRY TO A ARE ALIGNING WITH HOW THEY ARE RECRUITING CLASS FOR THAT AS WELL. I'M IN I'M. SORRY CAN YOU REPEAT YOUR SECOND QUESTION. YES YES THE SECOND. AB SO CROSSING REALLY ACROSS THE WORLD THERE'S- YOU KNOW GIVEN WHAT THE PANDEMIC- THERE'S A LAW OF COMMERCE AROUND. NEW AND EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES MORE FREQUENTLY ARE GOING FROM ANIMALS TO. HUMANS AND SO I- THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ROLE THE VETS CAN PLAY. I IN IN IN THOSE- AND PREVENTING THE IN PREVENTING THE FUTURE PANDEMICS WHAT. ARE THERE ANY DISCUSSIONS- IN TERMS OF- THE EDUCATION- IT OR OVERALL IN REGARDS TO THIS- BOTTLE. AND I CAN PROBABLY ANSWER THAT QUESTION- THAT QUESTION REALLY GOES TO WERE FINALLY GETTING THE RESPECT WE DESERVE. BECAUSE IN DROP OF VETERINARY SCHOOL INTO OUR PRACTICES- WE ARE ARE ALL AWARE THAT IN THAT PROFESSION IS AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR SOMEONE OVER DISEASES DISEASES THAT CAN BE PASSED FROM ANIMALS TO HUMANS- AND SO FORTH- I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE ONE OF THE- DUTIES THAT I HAVE AS A PRACTICING VETERINARIAN. IS THAT I AM ACCREDITED BY THE USDA US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE IN PARTICULAR IS READING INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF DIFFICULT'S- SUBJECT BECAUSE FORECASTS ARE GOING OUT. OF THE COUNTRY- WITH THE PURPOSE OF MAKING THAT THESE PETS ARE. AND THEY DON'T HAVE COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. THAT MIGHT POSE A RISK. THE PUBLIC IN OTHER- WHEN WE FILL OUT THESE FORMS- HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN CONSIDERED TO BE A TREMENDOUS NUISANCE BY THE CLIENT THE OWNER OF THE PACK. THEY DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY YOU HAVE TO FILL OUT THESE FORMS AND COMPLY WITH REGULATIONS- BECAUSE IT IT HAD. THEY JUST DIDN'T GET IT JUST SON WASN'T ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR THE VETERINARIAN TO MAKE MONEY- WHICH WASN'T IT WAS IMPORTANT BOND. INVENTION OF THE SPREAD OF DISEASES BOB FROM. NOW WHAT IS HAPPENING ABOUT THE PANDEMIC BUT ONE THING IT DID BRING TO LIGHT. UP TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS THAT THESE DISEASES JOBS AXED A VETERINARIANS DO PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN HELPING NOT ONLY. STOP. THE SPREAD OF DISEASE BUT BEING. IN FIRST LIVE CHECK THEM OF WHEN THEY APPEAR. IN EVERY WHERE THEY SHOULDN'T BE. SO THE BOARD. DECISION AS THE REGULATORY BODY. PROBABLY HASN'T SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED THAT CONCERN BUT IT'S N ISSUE THAT IS TOP VERY WELL IN THE VETERINARY SCHOOLS- AND FORMER PRACTICES SO- WE ALWAYS HAVE TO HAPPEN ON- FRONTLINE OF. STANDING THIS COUNTRY AGAINST INFECTIOUS DISEASES THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THAT OCCUR THAT ARE NOT KNOWN TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT- HOW THIS COUNTRY IS. A VERY DISEASE FROM COMING TO OUR SHORES AND HOW GREAT THE STATE. IS SO IT'S JFF AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND- I'M AND WE'RE WE'RE ON AT. THANK YOU FOR THAT ARE ANSWER I THAT THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS ON DISEASE THAT BE INTO THE STATE FROM YOU KNOW OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD BUT- I GUESS MY CONCERN IS ABOUT ALSO HOW DO WE ADDRESS. THE DISEASES THAT THAT ARE OCCURRING HERE WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND I REPRESENT A VERY RURAL AND AGRICULTURAL REGION AND THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF WHERE MY- CONCERN STEMS FROM- AND IN ADDITION I ALSO HAVE SOME- YOU MENTIONED RURAL AREAS AND- THERE'S BEEN KIND OF A NEED TO LOWER STANDARDS TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE ISSUES. ARE PARTICULARLY I'M INTERESTED AROUND- IT WHAT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF A PRESCRIBING- ANY TYPE OF MEDICATION TO ANIMALS- BUT SPECIFICALLY ANYTHING THAT. YOUR LIVESTOCK OR ANYTHING OF THAT SORT AND HORMONES. YEAH A LOT OF THE- A LARGE PART OF THE LICENSING POPULATION- ARE SMALL ANIMAL VETERINARIANS VETERINARIANS DEAL WITH DOGS AND CATS- BACK THERE ARE VETERINARIANS TO DEAL WITH- LIKE GENERAL'S- FROM PRODUCTION CHICKENS COWS AND SO FORTH- THOSE- THOSE GUYS ARE REALLY REALLY ON THE FOREFRONT OF INSPECTING. PRODUCTS INSPECTING FACILITIES MAKING SURE THAT I DISEASES DON'T BREAK OUT- ONE OF THE MORE RECENT CHALLENGES HERE YOUR BACK LINE THAT SPECIFIC AREA VETERINARY MEDICINE. HAS BEEN THE OVER USE OF ANTIBIOTICS AND- WHAT IS ABOUT TO. MAYBE CHIU YEARS AGO OUR- AT- DIRECTION OF GOVERNOR BROWN OF THE ACT- PART OF OUR CONTINUING EDUCATION NOW INCLUDES. AT LEAST OUR CONTINUED EDUCATION ON THE JUDICIOUS USE OF ANTIMICROBIALS SO THAT THESE ANIMATICS AREN'T USED. TOO MUCH SO AS TO LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DRUG RESISTANT STRAINS OF. FACTIONS SIMPLEX FRACTIONS. AND- BACK ALSO INCLUDE FOOD- THANK THAT ARE PUT INTO THE FOOD OUT OF LIVESTOCK. WITH THE INTENTION OF PREVENTING DISEASE BY I WE ALWAYS HAVE TO BE MINDFUL THAT- THINGS CAN DO HARM IF NOT USED PROPERLY. SO IT MY HAT'S OFF TO YOU YEAH. I AM A SMALL ANIMAL PRACTITIONER BUT MY HAT'S OFF DEFINITELY TO THE VETERINARIANS AND RPGS WORKING FOR DHARMA PRODUCTIONS BECAUSE THEY THEY REALLY TRULY ARE AT THE VERY FRONT OF DISEASE PREVENTION IN OUR STATE AND OUR COUNTRY. AND MY LAST QUESTION- WHAT THEY HAVE TWO MORE QUESTIONS THE FIRST ONE IS- IN TERMS OF THE INCREASE IN FEES DO YOU SEE ANY IMPACT ON- ON FOOD. THE COST OF FOOD AND THE SECOND. QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS- WHAT ARE WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON TYPES OF COMPLAINTS THAT THE BOARD RECEIVES AND WHAT IS THE FOR DOING TO ADDRESS THEM. BOARD MEMBER I DON'T I DON'T. CONFIDENTIAL SHOULD BE TO REDUCE COMPLETE PROCESS SO ALTERNATIVE JESSICA. STERN SO WHEN YOU COMES THE MOST COMMON COMPLAINTS THAT WE GET I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE REALLY HAVE HAD REALIZES THAT 75% OF THE COMPLAINTS THAT WE RECEIVED ARE ALLEGING NEGLIGENCE INCOMPETENCE UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT AND OFTEN THE IT UNFORTUNATELY AND HAS RESULTED IN ANIMALS WHO HAVE HAVE PASSED AWAY. I'M AND SO A LOT OF THESE COMPLAINTS ARE EXTREMELY COMPLEX BECAUSE WHEN YOU YOU DEAL WITH I'M AN ANIMAL HAS ALREADY- HAVE PASSED. AWAY AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF- A MOTIONS THAT ARE THAT ARE TIED TO THE- AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT YOU HAVE TIME. TO SAY MULTIPLE VETERINARIANS THAT WERE INVOLVED IN THE CARE OF THAT ANIMAL AND SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MULTIPLE RESPONDENTS WERE TALKING ABOUT MULTIPLE METAL MEDICAL RECORDS AND THAT ARE INVOLVED AND SO THERE THERE ARE. A LOT HIGHER LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY THAT TAKES A LOT OF TIME FOR INVESTIGATIONS I AND SO A LOT OF THEM. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS THE BOARD AND ONLY TAKES A PLAN AND IN A LOT SMALLER PERCENTAGES OF IT BECAUSE AFTER. I'M A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION THAT WE INCOMPLETE- I'M I'LL OFTENTIMES IT HASN'T RESULTED IN IN DISCIPLINARY MATTERS I'M AND THE VETERINARIANS ARE MEETING THE STAND UP HERE FOR THE MOST USES- BUT BUT IT IS AN UNFORTUNATE THAT. THAT THE MAJORITY OF HIS THAT WE ARE RECEIVING. ARE RELATED TO THE STANDARD OF CARE PROVIDED. AND THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION WAS IS RAISING THESE WAS GOING TO RESULT IN HIGHER PRICES FOR. FOOD I DON'T THINK I'VE HEARD THAT OPERATED REPORT. THAT SAYS THAT WHAT. IT CONSEQUENCES. I HAVE NOT EITHER THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY WHEN JACQUI IRWIN- THANK YOU I'M SORRY I WAS A COUPLE OF MINUTES LATE AND SO I'M NOT SURE IF YOU ADDRESS IT BUT COULD YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS. CONFLICT BETWEEN THE- OF VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND SHELTERS ON IT TELEHEALTH AND WHAT IS A REALLY GOOD I'D LIKE TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE VALUE OF TELEHEALTH IT SEEMS SORT OF ODD ONE ANIMALS REALLY. CAN'T COMMUNICATE THAT IT SEEMS THAT IT WOULD BE REALLY OF LIMITED- VALUE. SO I CAN TALK ABOUT IT- AS A CONSUMER BUT I THINK MARK IS A BET SHE'D PROBABLY TALK ABOUT IT. AT THE BEGINNING- FROM A VETERINARY PERSPECTIVE. I AM TELEHEALTH IS. I FIRST pTHERE DEFINITELY IS SOME INSTANCES WHERE TELEHEALTH WOULD BE- CAN BE USED APPROPRIATELY AND THOSE ARE PROBABLY SITUATIONS WHERE THERE'S ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED- WHAT WE CALL OF THE CPR. A. P. SHE COLLABORATION CHIP WHEREAS AS AS A PRACTICING- I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH MY PATIENTS AND THEIR CONDITIONS AND- ONCE IN A WHILE. YOU KNOW- MY CLIENT WILL CALL UP AND SAY TO SEVEN UP THAT AGAIN AND I COULD SEE. DASH FOR THIS IN THE NINE. WHAT CONDITION DASH HAS BEEN RECONNECTED JUST TO KERR TREAT OR- ADD NEW ONES I THINK. IN THOSE IT'S PROBABLY. BLACKS IT'S ALSO ONE OF THOSE WERE IT'S A LITTLE- DANGERS TO COMPARE BUT BY THE G. AND THAT'S- BECAUSE YOU YEMEN LAST AND TALIBAN DEFINITELY IS. BECOMING VERY POPULAR. AND THE BIGGER WHY AND WHERE FOR THEM IS THAT PATIENTS CAN TALK ASIAN SKIN SOME OF SIMPLE. WHAT FEELING AND HOW LIKE WE ON. IS OWNERS INTEREST. OF WHAT THAT THE STEEL OR EXPERIENCE. I'LL GIVE YOU A GOOD OF WHY TELEMEDICINE. REALLY FIT WELL WITH PROFESSION- RECENTLY A FRIEND OF MY CALLED UP TRICKS HIS- FRUSTRATE. WITH BACK BEING ABLE TO GETS ADVICE FROM BETTER. HE OWNS SOME OF MOLLA AND HE TOOK THE CHARGER PARK. LAST WEEK AT A COUPLE OF DAYSLATER THE MOSTAR TO CALL. AND JOHN HE AS SOON YOU KNOW HIS CHEER PICKED SOMETHING FROM THE DOG PARK LIKE GENERAL HOSPITAL JUST ONE IS THE IN EVERY. DESCRIBE SOME AND. FOR WHEN I HIM TELL THIS THE FIRST THING THAT I WAS THAT HE TO CHOOSE. AND LITTLE DOG LIKE SHE- SOMETIMES CAN BE TO. HEART DISEASE OR THE BE PRONE TO. AND COMICAL IT. LIKE AMERITRADE IT AND NOW BRING PIPE. AND- THOSE ALL MEMBERS IN A- SO ACT THAT THE JOB TO TALK PART A COUPLE DAYS AGO. MAYBE JUST A QUITE STEP. AND THE- NOT THIS IS A BE. PRODUCTS USED ANOTHER. FOR THE WAY WE TELL THE OFTENTIMES IS BY NO TO THEIR STATUS TO JUST- DEALING WITH HER HAIR TO GET A SEE IF THERE'S- SENSITIVITY THAT ARE SMILING. THOSE ARE THINGS I CAN DO- OVER THE TELEPHONE- EVERY TO. BECOME A WHOLE IMAGE THE DOCTOR AND START. I CAN TELL THAT- DID YOU LOG TELL ME THAT ABOUT COST OF HEALTH. A COFFEE. I HAVEN'T HEART. SO THAT'S- DOES ALWAYS WORK AND WITH OUR PROFESSION SO- WE'RE NOT. COMPLETE OPPOSE TO COME WHATSOEVER. BUT IT NEEDS TO BE. OR ELSE HARM CAN BE DONE TO THE CONSUMER. WELL THAT WOULD CERTAINLY MAKE SENSE TO ME SO COULD YOU. THE SHELTERS ON WHAT WHAT WOULD THEY BE USING TELL FOR. VISIT IT'S LIKE THEY WERE LIKE TAKE. ACCESS. THIS JUST SHOWS OUR COMMUNITY. DOES WANTS TO YOU KNOW CHALLENGE TO EXPAND ACCESS TO AND I HAPPENED MOVIE THAT THE REASON YOU'RE THIS THEY JUST MIGHT BE A TO SEE MORE. IF THE CAN DO WHAT OVER THE- OR OVER J. ONE THEN. TO HAVE THOSE PATIENTS COMING THE CLINIC TO SEE THE- AND THERE THERE IS THAT- YOU KNOW IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING AND- AGAIN GOING BACK TO. THAT FIRST EXAMINATION ZERO TO REALLY LISTEN TO THE PACK G. OF THE CAT JUST SMELL PACKED THOSE ARE THINGS THAT JUST CAN'T BE ACCOMPLISHED OVER THE PHONE. AND EVEN THOUGH IT MAY BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE MARC SENSIBILITY MAY BE ABLE TO SEE MORE BLACK THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN. IT IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO I DON'T I DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE. A MINIMUM STANDARD OF CARE ON A BRAND NEW PATIENTS ARE WITHOUT SEEING IT FIRST. RIGHT THANK YOU FOR THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THEN PERHAPS MY QUESTION IS- BETTER DIRECTED TO THE CHAIRS OF OUR COMMUNITY- REVIEWING THE I WANT TO RETURN TO THE FEE ISSUE VERY QUICKLY AND I'M NOTICING THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FEES HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY 30% IN ATTORNEYS SERVICES AND 71% INCREASE IN. LEGAL SERVICES AND THAT WOULD APPEAR TO PERHAPS IMPACT ON MANY OF OUR- BOARDS UNDER I. D. C. A. R. MAY WE ASK THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO COME IN AT SOME POINT IN TIME AND GIVE US. SOME SORT OF AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THEIR DEPARTMENT THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SIGNIFICANT FEE INCREASES THAT WILL BE PASSED ON OF COURSE TO A NUMBER OF OUR OF OUR OUR OVERSIGHT BOARDS IT WAS SOME INTERESTING YOU KNOW BREEZES BEEN A PROBLEM SINCE I WAS NINE BEIN P. BACK AND TWENTY I THINK WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE SCANDIA IF NOT PERFECTED YET I ASSUME ARE STILL WORKING THROUGH IT BUT- THIS IS A- SPECIFIC. SIGNIFICANT JUMP IN WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THIS BOARD IS TELLING US- REGARDING THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THEIR CURRENT OF FUNDED THEY'RE LOOKING AT OF FEE INCREASES THAT ARE GOING TO HIT US AND TWENTY THREE IS IT TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE SO AND WE'D BE LOOKING OUT YOU KNOW SO ANOTHER JUMP. THAT SUB. ON OUR- ON OUR VETERINARIANS IN PERHAPS MY OTHER. OF OUR OUR BOARD AND GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT I THINK IS PRETTY CRITICAL. RIGHT AFTER ON EITHER HAIR TO RESPOND IF WE MIGHT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO AT LEAST HAVE A REPORT FROM THEM AS TO THE REASON WE'VE SEEN THIS KIND OF FEE INCREASE- THAT IS. TRANSFERRED TO YOU KNOW THE INDIVIDUAL BOARDS. EVENT INFORMATION AS YOU AS YOU KNOW THERE ARE MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES AS WE HAVE OF SIXTEEN BOARDS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS THIS YEAR A WITH A NUMBER OF- COSTS AND INCREASE AND- COST MEASURES THAT ARE DRIVING THE FEE INCREASES SPECIFICALLY AROUND MULTIPLE BOARDS AND THAT'S A- CONTINUING ISSUE THAT COMMITTEE MEMBERS WILL BE HEARING. AS WE ARE PRESENTED WITH A NUMBER THE BOARDS THAT WILL BEGIN COMING BEFORE US- AS WE BEGIN- THIS CALENDAR YEAR TO OBEY CERTAINLY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT AND ENGAGE WITH THE APPROPRIATE STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS THIS. UNDER AS HOLISTICALLY AS WELL AS AND DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS SENATE ROTH AT. WELL YOU KNOW AS A PRANK FORMER PRACTICING ATTORNEY I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE HAD. A SITUATION WHERE I COULD IMPOSE A 30% FEE INCREASE ON MY CLIENTS. AND NOT HAVE THE CLIENTS BE IN A POSITION TO COMPLAIN. SO I DO THINK THAT IT'S A IT IS CLEARLY APPROPRIATE TO HAVE AN INQUIRY I FULLY INTEND TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS. I DON'T COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND HOW THAT CAN. THAT SITUATION CAN HAPPEN WITHOUT ANY- CONVERSATION IN ADVANCE. SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WITH THE WITH OF COURSE THE CONCURRENCE OF BY. CHURCH LOW- WE'LL FIGURE OUT A WAY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. ON THAT POINT. I THANK YOU HI AND FINALLY WHAT REGARDING THE COMMENTS THAT DOCTOR NUNEZ MADE EARLIER ABOUT RESPECT I WANT YOU TO KNOW MY DOCTOR FRIENDS TELL ME THAT IT'S HARDER TO BECOME- DOCTOR OF VETERINARY MEDICINE IT DOWN THE USUAL PRACTICE OF MEDICINE SO IT. SKEWS ME DOCTOR BROWN BUT- I'VE HEARD THAT A NUMBER OF TIMES SO THAT YOU HAVE A GREAT RESPECT FROM ALL OF US. ANIMAL LOVERS ARE NOT. THANK pSENATOR BATES ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. AT THIS TIME BEFORE WE GO INTO WITNESSES- JUST WANT TO ALSO- YEAH I JUST WANT TO ALSO MAKE A ON- REMARK ED TO ECHO SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF. ALSO BY A COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY BILL THIS IS A AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE MEMBER DAVID CHIU- AND HAD THAT HE HAS HEARD ALSO FROM ITS CONSTITUENCIES TO- REFERENCE THE DESIRE TO BROADEN PERSPECTIVE TO ENSURE ACCESS TO CARE FOR OWNED AND SHELTER PETS AS WELL SO. I KNOW THAT THIS IS THE ONGOING CONVERSATION OF QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM. YOUR ROTH. THANK YOU A THANK YOU CARILLO- LET ME RETURN TO THE QUESTION IS- THEY WERE POSED BY MY COLLEAGUE IN THE ASSEMBLY REGARDING. A RURAL SHELTERS- AND THE REGULATIONS. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THESE RURAL SHELTERS AT LEAST IN PART CONTENT THEY NEED THE ABILITY TO PERFORM. WHAT THEY DESCRIBE AS LOW RISK ANIMAL CARE WITHOUT VETERINARIAN OVERSIGHT SUCH AS VACCINATIONS- AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT SUBJECT. IS ENCOMPASSED IN THESE REGULATIONS THAT WERE REFERENCED EARLIER IS THAT CORRECT. ANYONE. YES IN THE REGULATIONS- THAT WE ARE PROPOSING BACKS OBVIOUSLY VACCINATIONS- PARASITE CONTROL- ARE IMPORTANT IN SHELTERS AND THIS- THE REGULATIONS WOULD ALLOW FOR A VETERINARIAN TO WRITE UP- PROTOCOLS AND FOR SHELTER STAFF TO ADMINISTER VACCINES- USING UTILIZING THOSE PROTOCOLS RIGHT NOW STE ALL THE SHELTERS- THAT ADMINISTER VACCINES AND ALL OF THAT- REGARDLESS IF THEY DON'T DO ANY SPAY AND NEUTER BUT THEY DO VACCINES WHICH IS CRITICAL AND PARASITE THEY ARE UNDER THE CURRENT- MINIMUM STANDARDS OF VETERINARY MEDICINE FOR FACILITIES- WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS RELAX THOSE THOSE STANDARDS FOR THOSE SHELTERS THAT HAVE A DIFFICULTY WITH HAVING A VETERINARIAN ON SITE. FIVE AND. IN THE RURAL AREAS CETERA. ONE MAKE SURE A BIG IT CLEARS SO THE MINUTE STAY CURRENTLY REQUIRE. THAT A VETERINARIAN BE ON SITE IN ORDER FOR THAT ACTIVITY TO OCCUR. I DO NOT- JESSICA PLEASE CORRECT ME BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THEY REQUIRE THE VETERINARIAN TO BE ON SITE. VETERINARY THE NEW MINIMUMS FOR SHELTER MEDICINE IS THAT A VETERINARIAN ESTABLISHES THE PROTOCOLS RESULT FROM ACCIDENTS YEAH- ONCE THOSE PARTICLES BEEN ESTABLISHED NO NAY MAYBE POSTED ON THE WALL THE PRESENT IN A BINDER SOME PLACE THAT- THAT SHELTER STAFF GEN MINISTER THOSE VACCINATIONS. AND THAT'S WHAT I READ ARE GOING TO ALLOW. THAT TO CURB WITH THAT IN AND HAVING TO THERE OKAY LET ME GET TO MY POINT ONE OF MY- COULD CAN. IS THE SPEED OR LACK SPEED BY WHICH WE ALL OF US. REDUCE REGULATIONS IN THE STATE. FROM START TO FINISH AND THE MATERIAL THAT WAS PROVIDED TO US INDICATES THAT THESE PARTICULAR REGULATIONS MAYBE I'M WRONG. WERE UNOFFICIALLY ADOPTED OR AUTHORIZED ONE OF THE OTHER. BY THE BOARD IN APRIL OF- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND THE PROCESS OF FEW MINUTES AGO IS DESCRIBED AS BEING IN ITS INFANCY AND SO I GUESS MY QUESTION WITH RESPECT TO THESE PARTICULAR REGULATIONS HAVING TO DO WITH RURAL SHELTERS IS WHEN WERE THE REGULATIONS INITIALLY PROMULGATED. APRIL TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IS THAT FINE. AND WHY IS IT TAKING SO LONG SINCE WE'RE NOW IN. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. D. THE BOARD APPROVED THE REGULATIONS AND I BELIEVE IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IT WAS SHORTLY AFTER I STARTED WHEN I STARTED IN JULY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND WHEN THEY APPROVE THE FINAL I AND I THINK WHAT WHAT UNFORTUNATELY HAPPENED DURING THAT TIME IS THAT WE WERE GOING OVER A PERIOD F TRANSITION LESS STAFF AS WELL AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT WE ALSO HAD. A LOT OF REGULATIONS THAT WERE ALREADY IN QUEUE BEFORE ABOUT TWENTY ONE TWENTY WILL MAKING PACKAGES AND A GOOD CHUNK OF THEM HAD ALREADY BEEN I'M STARTED IN THE REVIEW PROCESS AND SO THIS ONE AND I AM I HAVE ONE POLICY ANALYSTS YOU'LL HELP MOVE ALL THESE PACKAGES THROUGH. AND SO THAT PLUS DANCE IS DEVOTED TO THE ALL OF THE REGULATIONS THAT WERE ALREADY IN THE QUEUE AND SO WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DEAL I'M DEVELOP TRYING TO THAT THE SHELTER REGULATIONS NEARLY BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE REGULATIONS THAT WERE. ALREADY GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS. ONE OF THE THINGS I'M GOING TO BE A- OF. BOARDS TO DO FROM PURSE- IT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS REGULATORY PROCESS AND SEE HOW WE CAN STREAMLINED AND EXPEDITED. AND THE OTHER THING I'M GOING TO BE ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT SO IT MIGHT. MOVE THOE WHO WERE ASSOCIATED WITH BOARDS TO START DOING THIS- IS TO START KEEPING A- BUT AT A TIME LOG. THE RECORD. FROM THE INCEPTION OF THE REGULATION TO THE FINAL ADOPTION. EXPLAINING DELAYS IN THE PROCESS MEASURED AGAINST YOUR TIME STANDARDS WHICH I HOPE YOU HAVE FOR THE ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS BECAUSE I WANT TO START HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT SPECIFICALLY WHAT THE DELAYS ARE AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP YOU AS BOARDS AND INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE ATTEMPTING TO DO A VERY DIFFICULT JOB. A MOVE THESE REGULATIONS ALONG WITH A LITTLE MORE- SPEED- AND EFFICIENCY I DO APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO I DO UNDERSTAND. HAVING BEEN REMINDED JUST THE OTHER DAY THAT OF THE REASON YOU DO REGULATIONS IS BECAUSE WE PASSED BILLS THAT TURNED INTO STATUTES THAT NEED TO BE INTERPRETED AND- I AM COGNISANT OF THAT BUT I ALSO THINK THAT. AS WE MOVE OUR PRACTICE ALONG HERE AND TRY TO BE MORE EFFICIENT I THINK THE BOARDS IN THE UNDER THE DC A NEED TO DO SO AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. SO ONE OF. SOMEWHAT RELATED NOTE HAVING TO DO WITH ENFORCEMENT YOU KNOW IT'S COME TO MY ATTENTION AND LOOKING AT VARIOUS BOARDS. IN THIS NEW JOB THAT I HAVE THE- MOST IF NOT ALL BOARDS OR ENFORCE IT EXPERIENCING DELAYS IN THE ENFORCEMENT PROCESS. AND THAT YOURS IS ONE OF THOSE AND I'M I'M WONDERING IF YOU CAN. TALK TO ME ABOUT. THE NATURE OF THE DELAYS IN THE ENFORCEMENT PROCESS AND- BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE- WHICH DELAYS APPEAR TO BE WITHIN THE CONTROL OF THE BOARD AND WHICH DELAYS APPEAR. TO BE OUTSIDE OF THE CONTROL OF THE BOARD. SURE I JUST WANTED TO GO BACK TO YEAR YOUR NEWS COMMENTS ABOUT THEM WERE MAKING PROCESS AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS- AND THE CONCERNS I THINK THAT MANY OF US I'M FROM THE CORPORATE SEPTEMBER SECOND HAVE THE SIMILAR CONCERNS BUT WHAT I CAN'T STAND. SINCE THE APPOINTMENT OF THE NEW DIRECTORY DCA I KNOW I'M ARE WE MAKING PACKAGES HAVE SEEN SEEN TO BE MOVING AT QUICKER. AND I KNOW THAT THE RULE MAKING PROCESS IS SOMETHING THAT SHE'S REALLY FOCUSED ON IMPROVING SITE I KNOW THAT ALL OF US AT THE BOARD AND I DO SEE A WERE DEFINITELY WILLING TO YOU. I'M EVALUATE THE PROCESS AND STREAMLINED WHEREVER POSSIBLE. WHEN IT COMES TO ENFORCEMENT I THINK THERE ISN'T A NUMBER OF THINGS AND THEN I FOUND THAT HAD CREATED SUCH A LONG PROCESSING TIME AND WE'VE WE'VE TAKEN A LOT OF MEASURES AND TO IMPROVE THE PROCESSES. I'M ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT THAT I DID WHEN I FIRST STARTED IS AND WHEN I EVALUATED WHAT WAS OCCURRING IN OUR ENFORCEMENT ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM. PLAN LET ME BACK UP IS THAT WE WERE GETTING ROUGHLY TWELVE HUNDRED COMPLAINTS A YEAR WE HAD FOR IT FOR A COMPLETE LIST TWO OF WHICH WERE HANDLING THE ENTIRE INVESTED YOU KNOW HE SLOW. I'M AND THEN THAT AND THOSE WERE OUR LOWER LEVEL ANALYSTS THEY WERE SELF SERVICE ANALYST HE HE I'M- MORE AT THE HIGHER LEVEL ANALYSTS THE EPA'S THEY WERE HANDLING THE DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS LEADING WITH THE DISPLAY KEY PHOTO SIGNIFICANTLY LESS. I'M LISTENING ROUGHLY FORTY HE SAYS HERE THAT THAT WERE THEY WERE HANDLING DISCIPLINE WHEN THE TWO STAFF SERVICES DALLAS WERE IN CHARGE OF DOING- ALL OF THE INVESTIGATIVE CASELOAD. AND SO THAT WAS. JUST A OF. GARY AND MATT SO. AND SO WE DID IS WE DIDN'T. UP ALL OF CASES AMONG OF THE- WE INCREASE THE CLASS OF THE- MAKE THEM S. AND A- YEAH. AND I'M AND WE- A LOT OF TRINA ON HOW TO YOU. THE KEY FROM TO FINISH. ANOTHER THING WE REALLY. SAW WE- WAS ON RELIANCE ON. AND ARE. SUFFERS I IT WAS ONE PRACTICE THE PAST. THAT MOST IRAQIS GO DIVISION AND THEN A MESSAGE. HE ALSO GO OUT FOR AND WHEN WE USED TO BE AND BY. I'M OCT. THEY WERE USED FOR SCENES THAT WE- I'M AT THIS POINT. OUR NOT NOT. SO I'M WE'RE USING TO MY TO GO OUT AND GET I RECORD WHEN WE CAN USE OUR AND- TO DO THAT. WE ARE USING THE ONLINE TO. AND GET A CLUE RECORD AND ARREST RECORDS FROM ARREST AGENCIES WHEN IT COMES PHOENIX. OTHER THINGS MY STAFF IS ABLE DEAL I'M AND SO WE WHEN YOU LOOK AT AT AT DMI IT TAKES A VERY LONG TIME AND IT'S ALSO VERY VERY EXPENSIVE. TO DEAL I'M ONE THING I THINK THAT IS WORTH NOTING THAT. I YES THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT THE INCREASE FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE BUT ONE THING FREE DENIES THERE'S A CONSTANT INCREASE. EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND WE'RE UP TO PAYING ATTY ACTUALS FOR TWENTY NINETEEN WAS THREE HUNDRED TWO DOLLARS PER HOUR AND THE KEY SAYS FOR DMI. AND AS A LESS COMPLEX HE'S GOING TO BE A MINIMUM OF TWENTY HOURS. I IN SAID THAT THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT COST THERE WAS ONE YEAR I BELIEVE IT WAS SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN WE SPENT THREE QUARTERS OF. A MILLION DOLLARS ON DELIGHT CLASS. BUT I THINK THAT WE WERE UNDER THE UTILIZED A LOT IS THERE EXISTS TOOL EVERY. ARE INSPECTOR. THERE KEALAKEHE THE OF THE- EXPERTISE NEEDED I'M IS- IN A STILL. THEY KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR A MEDICAL RECORDS AND SO WHAT WE REALLY DID AS AS WE TRANSITIONED OUR RELIANCE ON USING BOTH DIVISION INVESTIGATION AND INSPECTORS. DIDN'T JEAN INCREASING OUR USE ON OUR ON OUR INSPECTORS IN OUR SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS. ANOTHER THING THAT WE CHANGES I'M NOT ONLY WERE USING DFI ANR INSPECTORS IN IN MULTIPLE PIECES- BUT WE ARE ALSO USING MULTIPLE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS. ON OUR CASES THAT INVOLVED STAND UP HERE ISSUES AND LIKE I SAID IN THE BEGINNING 35% OF OUR CASES ARE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS. IN THE PROCESS WAS THAT WE HAD OUR AND ALL OF OUR CASES WERE ALWAYS REVIEWED BY ASSESSMENT EXPERTS EVEN PIECES BURKE. I'M REGARDING THINGS THAT WERE NOT NECESSARILY SEND THE CARES OF CONVICTION HE SAYS. AND THOSE CASES DON'T NECESSARILY NEED AN EXPERT TO APPLYING BECAUSE THE MERE FACT THAT THERE'S A CONVICTION IS ENOUGH TO INVESTIGATE BUT WE DON'T NEED THE EXPERTISE. OF THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT. I'M SO IT GO FOR I ARE HOUSE. WE TO MOVE THEM AT THE TIME IN THE AND THEY WOULD DO. YOU KNOW THEIR WRITE UP A REPORT AND THEN IF SOMETHING I THE BILL. WAS AGREED YOU LEVEL THE SUPPLY THAT IT WAS BEEN SO YOU CAN OUT TO ANOTHER SUCH MATTER AT. THAT SOME EXPERT NEW ALL OF NEED FOR. EITHER OWN OPINION WELL AND THAT WAY IN. THE A OF TIME AND MONEY. ON A CASE. I WE IN SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS. AMERICANS CASES WHEN. THAT HOW DOES THE PLAN I'M WE ALSO HAD MULTIPLE PEOPLE AT THE TIME WHO WERE TOUCHING THOSE CASES. I MULTIPLE STAFF PEOPLE IN SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS WE HAD CASES WHERE WE HAD- YOU CAN HAVE UP TO. YOU TO SUCH AN EXPERT FROM PORTSMOUTH AND I WE CAN HAVE AS INSPECTOR THAT DID THE INITIAL INSPECTION AND INNOCENT DOCTOR LEAD INSPECTOR WHEN IT COMES TO COMPLAINT SOMEWHERE RT AT FORCED SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS IS. ESSENTIALLY WE HAD MULTIPLE STAFF WERE INVOLVED. I'M AND WE HAD. INVOLVED AS WELL SO THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE SPECIFIC CASE AND WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN THOSE CASES GOING HERE IN. ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE SUBPOENAED TO TESTIFY IT WAS NOT COMMON THAT IN THOSE CASES WE CAN HAVE A HEARING THAT'S TWO TO THREE WEEKS WANT. AND WE DURING THOSE DAYS EVERY SINGLE DAY WERE PAYING PART WITNESSES OKAY FOR THE L. J. RIPPING FOR THE COURT REPORT FOR PAYING FOR THE DAY. AND NOT THAT CAPTURED CLUSTER. HIS CLASSICAL STOPS AND AS UP INTO THEY'VE- HEARING. TO BE THE PERSON ON THAT KEY IS THE R. X. ONE EXPERT WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT HAVING JUST ONE ONE STAFF MEMBER INVOLVED IN THAT CASE I SAID THAT'S ALSO GOING TO STREAMLINE A LOT OF THE PROCESS THIS ANOTHER THING THAT WE REALLY WORKED ON WITH END UP THEN- DETERMINE GENERAL'S OFFICE IS MORE COMMUNICATION UP FRONT. I'M AND ALSO AT THE SME TIME OUR STAFF DOING MORE WORK UP FRONT IN THE PAST WHAT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IS THAT WE WENT ON WE GOT A CASE WE WILL TO THE SUBJECT OF THE CASE AND ASK THEM FOR MEDICAL RECORDS WE DIDN'T TELL THEM WHAT THE ALLEGATIONS WERE AND ASKING FOR A RESPONSE AT THE TIME WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT WE ARE GETTING THE MEDICAL RECORDS FROM THEM AND WE WERE GETTING THE INFORMATION FROM THE COMPLAINTS. THAT WOULD GO OUT TO THE SUCH MEASURE EXPRESSED FOR REVIEW AND THEN WE GATHER ALL THAT INFORMATION AND SEND IT OUT TO THE TWENTY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND SAY THAT WE WANTED TO FILE AN ACCUSATION. YOU GO AHEAD AND COLLECT THE MEDICATION. AND THE MITIGATION IN. AN THE SERBS WERE. TO THE- AND- A MEDICARE FACTORS THAT THE PERSON HAS DONE. I'M TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE- VIOLATIONS ON RECORD THAT. I'M SORRY I'M SORRY I'M SORRY JIM YESTERDAY- CONCLUDE YOUR A RESPONSE AS I KNOW THAT CHAIRMAN ACT HAS A QUESTIONS SO WE CAN BE TIMELY WITH OUR NEXT BOARD MAYBE I CAN. MAYBE I CAN HELP ONE. I'D LIKE TO SEE SOME DETAIL MAYBE FROM THE BOARD TO STAFF AND- ENSURE LOW YOU CAN INCLUDE ME IF YOU LIKE. ON WHAT THESE PROCESS CHANGES ARE THAT YOU EITHER ARE PROPOSING OR OF IMPLEMENTED MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS TIRES I ASSUME BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU HAVE PERFORMANCE METRICS. ON THIS ENFORCEMENT PROCESS MUCH LIKE THE DCA IS IMPLEMENTED WITH RESPECT TO REGULATIONS IN OTHER WORDS RIGHT PROCESSING TIMELINES GOALS AND OBJECTIVES SO I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT THOSE PERFORMANCE METRICS ARE I DIDN'T SEE THEM IN THE STAFF REPORT. AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU TRACK THE DELAYS BEYOND YOUR PERFORMANCE METRICS AND TRACK THE REASONS FOR THE DELAY. AND. MEASURE THOSE AGAINST YOUR METRICS. ONE OKAY SO THAT'S THE END FOR I'D LIKE HAVE AN MICHAEL. IS THESE VARIOUS PROCESS- IMPROVEMENTS THAT YOU HAVE MENTIONED AND THAT YOU HAVE IMPLEMENTED. HAVE YOU QUANTIFIED IT WHETHER OR NOT THOSE IMPROVEMENTS HAVE INCREASED. YOUR PROCESSING TIME OR OR KEPT AT THE SAME OR DECREASED IT AND IF SO. WHAT'S THE ANSWER. SO WE'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE ALL OF THAT IN WRITING FOR YOU I'M AND THEN SHORT ANSWER FOR THAT IS IT'S GOING TO BE SOME TIME BEFORE WE SEE THE ACTUAL OVERALL IMPROVEMENTS BECAUSE MY STAFF IS REALLY FOCUSING ON CASES THAT ARE OVER. AT FOUR YEARS OLD AND UNFORTUNATELY THOSE HE SAYS HAVE ALREADY GONE THROUGH ALL OF THESE PROCESSES THAT HAVE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT CHANGING AND SO WE ARE WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THE BACKLOG RIGHT NOW. BUT I'M MORE HAPPY TO PROVIDE ALL OF THAT THE NECESSARY DATA TO SHOW. INCREMENTAL THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE HAPPENING AND THEN ALSO THE COST SAVINGS OVERALL. OKAY LET ME MOVE QUICKLY TO COST RECOVERY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WITH RESPECT TO. DCA BOARDS- STRUCTURAL DEFICITS A SEEM TO BE A FACT OF LIFE IF NOT NOW IN THE FUTURE. SO WITH RESPECT. TO COST RECOVERY- ARE YOU ABLE FULLY RECOVER YOUR ENFORCEMENT COSTS FROM THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DISCIPLINED. THAT'S THE QUESTION AND LET ME BREAK IT DOWN WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFICITY. THERE OBVIOUSLY A TOTAL ENFORCEMENT EXPENSES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A VARIETY OF CASES BUT THERE ARE COSTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED. WITH CASES WHERE COST RECOVERY IS POSSIBLE. IN THOSE CASES WERE COST RECOVERY IS POSSIBLE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR ENFORCEMENT COSTS DO YOU RECOVER. ON THE AVERAGE. SO I DON'T HAVE THAT PERCENTAGE- I MEAN BUT I CAN I'M HAPPY TO RUN RIGHT AFTER THIS HEARING I'M BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THAT THE COST RECOVERY ON THE ON THE TURN THAT IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER THAT THAT WAS POSSIBLE THE DISCIPLINE ALSO INCLUDES I'M THOSE WHO HAVE SURRENDERED OR HAD REVOKED LICENSES. AND WHILE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IT'S LIKELY THE ONLY WE ONLY WILL SEE THOSE COSTS WITH A PETITION FOR REINSTATEMENT AND SO THAT'S IT THAT'S IT SINCE YOU WERE IN PART BETWEEN THAT WE ACTUALLY RECOUP THOSE COSTS BUT I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE THE ACTUAL PERCENTAGE IN THAT ANALYSIS FOR YOU. WELL I WOULD LIKE SEE THAT AND MISTER. ONE FINAL- THE SUBJECT OF ANIMAL PHYSICAL REHABILITATION. WAS DISCUSSED IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER APPEARS TO BE AN ISSUE. OF ANIMAL PHYSICAL REHABILITATION BY LICENSED PHYSICAL THERAPIST AS OPPOSED TO. OF VETERINARIANS AND MY QUESTION IS DOES THE BOARD WANT THE AUTHORITY TO ALLOW. LICENSED PHYSICAL THERAPISTS PHYSICAL THERAPISTS UNDER VETERINARY SUPERVISION TO PERFORM. THAT TYPE OF SERVICE TO THE OUR ANIMAL POPULATION. YEAH I CAN I CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION I MEAN SHORT ANSWER IS YES THE LICENSE. THEIR PAST- CAN'T PERFORM PHYSICAL THERAPY UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A VETERINARIAN IN THE CURRENT REGULATIONS THAT WE HAVE FOLLOWS. I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOME ISSUE THAT THE BOARD'S CLAIM THAT THE BOARD DIDN'T HAVE AUTHORITY TO. PERMIT THAT AND THEN THERE WAS A BILL IN THE BOARD OPPOSED THE BILL OF LIFE. HAVE I FORGOTTEN MY LEGISLATIVE HISTORY. YEAH THE CONTROVERSY WAS THAT- INITIALLY THE PHYSICAL THERAPY BOARD IS APPOINTED REGULATES- PHYSICAL THERAPISTS IN THEIR PRACTICE ACT- THEY ONLY TALK ABOUT PRACTICING PHYSICAL THERAPY ON HUMANS- NO ONE IN THEIR PRACTICE ACT THE TALK ABOUT THEM PRACTICES ON ANIMALS- OUR PRACTICE ACT- IT WAS JUST GOT THERE IT WAS DEFINED AS THE PRACTICE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE. AND ASKED THE PRACTICES THAT IT NEVER MET THAT IN A MEDICINE THAT NEEDS TO BE PERFORMED BY VETERINARIANS- IT COULD ALSO BE PERFORMED BY OUR REACHES UNDER- LEVEL OF SUPERVISION BY THE VETERINARIANS AND VETERINARY ASSISTANCE UNDER THE LEVEL OF SUPERVISION. VETERINARIANS- WHAT WAS- WHAT NEEDED TO BE TO OUR PRIME ARE WAS- TO A- JUST COMPARE. TO PRACTICE- FINAL- SO THAT IT WOULD BE IN OUR PRACTICE ACT BUT THE BIG AREA OF CONTENTION WAS WHAT LEVEL OF SUPERVISION DURING THESE PHYSICAL THERAPISTS NEED TO OPERATE UNDER- THEY- ONE SIDE BELIEVES THAT THE- ARE ONE STEP THE NEED FOR PHYSICAL THERAPY WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE VETERINARIAN JESSICA SERVICE DOES NOT HAVE TO PRACTICE UNDER ANY LEVEL OF SUPERVISION ON THE VETERINARIAN AND ALSO VERY CONTENTION WAS- TODAY TO PRACTICES ACT. UP PREMISE COMMITTEE AREA LIKE AN INNER PEACE OR SOMETHING. WELL I'M WILL CLEAR OF THIS BUT THE JUST TO REFRESH RECOLLECTIONS THE BACKGROUNDER. INDICATES THAT THE LEGISLATURE ATTEMPTED TO ENACT THE CHANGE THROUGH AB THIRTY THIRTEEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHICH WOULD HAVE ALLOWED UNDER SPECIFIED CONDITIONS A LICENSED PHYSICAL THERAPIST UNDER VETERINARIAN SUPERVISION. THAT'S CENTERED SERVICE CENTER TO PROVIDE- PHYSICAL REHABILITATION SERVICES TO AN ANIMAL PATIENT THE BILL WAS HELD APPROPRIATIONS AND IN THE ASSEMBLY BUT WAS OPPOSED BY THE BOARD AND THAT'S THE BASIS FOR MY QUESTION WE CAN REVISIT THIS BUT- I THINK IT'S PROBABLY A SUBJECT THAT NEEDS TO BE- FURTHER DISCUSS. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER OFTEN IT'S AS A- AND OBSERVATION TO IRIS STILL UNDERSTAND YOU ALSO CARE SUB FOR IN THE SENATE TO IN WHICH- DID D. D. CA DEPARTMENT CONSUMER PRESS REGULATIONS. WREG'S UNITS I WAS UP FOR RENEWAL IN CONSIDERATION AS WELL TOO SO I THINK THAT WERE HEARING AS WE ARE TACKLING SOME OF THESE ISSUES ARE SOME REOCCURRING THEMES AND- HE BE PRUDENT FOR. A DCA AND OUR COMMITTEE STAFFS ALSO. HAVE DIALOGUE ON SOME OF THESE OUTSTANDING ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS SO HAVING SAID THAT CONCLUDING QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS WILL GO TO. PUBLIC COMMENT I CAN SEE THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE DIALED IN AND JUST AS A REMINDER WE PROVIDE A NO MORE THAN TWO MINUTES IF YOU COULD KINDLY LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO. NO MORE THAN TWO MINUTES IF YOU PREFER WE'D LIKE TO KEEP THEM AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE IN THE INTEREST OF TIME PUBLIC COMMENT MAY ALSO BE CONCLUDED. AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMMITTEE SO WE'LL GO TO THE OPERATOR OPERATOR PLEASE FEEL FREE TO. TO OPEN UP THE LINE AND PRIOR JUST BEFORE WE DO THAT ON THE S. IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS THAT VIRGO KEEP ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THE CHAMBERS AT THIS TIME- SO AGAIN MEMBERS OF. THE PUBLIC WHO WISH TO SPEAK OF FEEL FREE TO DO SO IN THE CURRENTLY IN THE CHAMBERS AND THEN WILL GO TO. INDIVIDUALS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO HAVE DIALED. IN PLEASE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

SHE MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THIS IS CALLED LONDON ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA PHYSICAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION. I DON'T LIKE TO JUST PICK UP ON ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN THAT SENATOR ROBERTS WAS DISCUSSING. RELATIVE TO ANIMAL REHABILITATION ANIMAL FISCAL THERAPY. JUST TO CLARIFY- THIS WHOLE ISSUE WAS TAGGED LAST SUNSETREVIEW HEARING BY THIS COMMITTEE. AND AT THE DIRECTION THE COMMITTEE A TASK FORCE WAS CREATED. TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE THE TASK FORCE INCLUDED MEMBERS FROM BETTER MEDICINE PHYSICAL THERAPY- ACADEMIA. OTHER INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS AND THEY RECOMMENDED THAT- PT'S IN FACT BE ALLOWED PROVIDE ANIMAL PHYSICAL REHABILITATION UNDER THE DEGREE OF SUPERVISION DETERMINED BY THE VETERINARIAN- THAT WITH THE STANDARD THAT WE'RE VERY COMFORTABLE WITH. PHYSICAL THERAPISTS ARE PROVIDING THIS KIND OF CARE IN OTHER STATES AS WELL. THE VETERAN MEDICAL BOARDS IN NORD THAT RECOMMENDATION AND INSTEAD APPROVED A STATE AND A KIND OF BIFURCATED THE ISSUE BASICALLY WHAT THEY DID IS THEY SAID THAT THAT AMBER WAS OKAY FOR A LARGE ANIMALS BUT NOT FOR SMALL ANIMALS. ARE BOUGHT ON THAT IS THAT THIS APPEARS TO BE REALLY A MEASURE OF CONTROL- THIS UNNECESSARY FOR VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THE VETERANS DECIDING THE LEVEL OF SUPERVISION. I DON'T ASK ME TO BASIS PER RELATIONSHIP AND WHAT THEIR COMFORT LEVEL CONTAINING THE P. T. WITHIN THE WORKING WITH INTRIGUING ANIMALS THE GOAL HERE REALLY IS GET THE ANIMALS MOVEMENT BACK TO THE BEST POSSIBLE CONDITIONS- IN IN THE- CARE AND SUPPORT OF ANIMALS. WE THINK WE'RE AT A PERIOD NOW BASED ON THE BOARD'S DECISION THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER STEPPING IN TO DETERMINE THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL. IN REALLY SELECT THE STANDARD THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE AND THAT IS INDEED ALLOWING THE BATTERY TO PICK LEVEL SUPERVISION THEY BELIEVE IS NECESSARY FOR THE ANIMAL AND WORKING WITH A PHYSICAL THERAPIST. WHO HAS THE CREDENTIALS ARE COMFORTABLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR YOUR TIME MISTER CHAIRMAN. THE NEXT COMMENT FROM THE LINE TWENTY ONE YOUR LONG IS OPEN. GOOD MORNING TRACY RIGHT WITH THE WORLD COUNTY RED. OF I JUST TO THE COMMENTS MADE BY VICE CHAIR FONG ON THE REGULATIONS RELATED SERVICES ALLOWED IN ANIMAL SHELTERS. WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ESPECIALLY FOR RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE THAT STRUGGLE TO HAVE- AN ADEQUATE NUMBER OF PROFESSIONALS HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS THAT CAN TREAT- THESE ANIMALS IN SHELTER AND SHELTER LOCATIONS- THAT THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS TO. MEET THAT PROTOCOLS- TO GET JUST A SIMPLE VACCINATIONS OR PROPHYLACTIC TREATMENTS ARE ARE FAR MORE THAN WHAT SOME OF THESE AREAS CAN- CAN MEET AND SO WE REALLY- APPRECIATE- BYE. BYE CHAIR FONG- COMMENTS AND- AND MEMBER FONG- MEMBER I'M SORRY NUMBER ROCK COMMENTS AND WE WOULD LIKE TO AN EMPLOYER THE- COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD TO PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THESE CONCERNS BEFORE MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU. THE NEXT TIME IT IS FOR THE LINE NUMBER FOURTEEN YOUR LINE IS NOW OPEN. HI MY NAME IS LISA STARTED WITH- FOUNDER AND CEO OF SOUTH SOUTH AND THAT IS THE REHAB THERAPY CENTER IN THE SILICON VALLEY- I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT SCOUTS OUT IS THE SECOND OLDEST VETERINARY REHABILITATION THERAPY CENTER IN CALIFORNIA WE OPENED SIXTEEN YEARS AGO THIS MAY. AND WE HAVE BEEN OPERATING- SENT THEM UNDER THE PREMISE OF HAVING A PHYSICAL THERAPIST FOR HUMANS. OF WORK UNDER THE INDIRECT SUPERVISION OF OUR VETERINARIANS- WE CAME TO THAT MODEL BECAUSE THEIR BUSINESS PARTNERS MY BUSINESS PARTNERS WERE LICENSED VETERINARIANS. AND I DECIDED THAT. BBM DID NOT HAVE TO FISH KNOWLEDGE TRAINING TO PERFORM THOSE SERVICES AND THAT IS MY OPINION MY BUSINESS PARTNER STILL HOLD TODAY- COMPLETE OPENS GAPS UP THE STREET MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND DOGS CATS AND OTHER COMPANION ANIMALS AND WE HAVE NEVER TO MY KNOWLEDGE RECEIVED A COMPLAINT. ABOUT HER MOM. I THINK THIS REGULATION WILL PREVENT A FINANCIAL BURDEN TO MY PRACTICE WE CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY A VETERINARIAN TO BE ON SITE AT ALL TIMES THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT. WE DO OPERATE UNDER HAVING A VETERINARIAN TO AN INITIAL EXAM AND INITIAL EVALUATION WITH ALL OF OUR PATIENTS. IN LEAGUE WITH A PHYSICAL THERAPIST WHO HEADS UP OUR PROGRAM. I SUPPORT THE IDEA OF ALLOWING. THE A TO PROVIDE VETERINARIANS THAT ANY REHAB FACILITY TO MAKE A DECISION WHETHER TO ALLOW THE TIKI TO OPERATE. UNDER INDIRECT OR DIRECT SUPERVISION OF THE TICKET OF THE DVM. BUT I'M NOT HAPPY AT ALL WITH THE WAY THIS WHOLE ISSUE'S BEEN HANDLED BY THE MET THAT MEDICAL BOARD. I DON'T THINK THEY'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THE STAKEHOLDERS LIKE OURSELVES I HAVE MADE MYSELF AVAILABLE MANY TIMES- TO- TALK WITH THEM AND HAVE THEM SEE HOW THIS WORKS. I THINK THEY'RE AND WILLINGNESS TO COLLABORATE WITH US HAS. BASICALLY MEANT THAT THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE NEEDS TO STEP IN AND SOLVE THIS ISSUE. I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SIXTEEN YEARS FOR SOMEBODY TO COME UP WITH REGULATIONS WE'VE DONE THE BEST WE COULD AND I THINK WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT MODEL WITH AN EXCELLENT KATIE. AND I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT I THINK ONE THING THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER IS HAVING A P. T. WHO WORKS UNDER INDIRECT SUPERVISION P. FIFTY BE CERTIFIED BY ONE THANK YOU VERY. MUCH WE HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND JUST ARE A- JIM. OF THE- A- IN IF YOU'RE MAY OF THE WHO. IS UP AS THAT IS OUR PREVIOUS BEEN STAY. PLEASE ONLY INDICATE YOUR NAME AND PET'S. ON THE TOPIC THANK YOU.

GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN LOW CHAIRMAN ROBIN MEMBERS I AM CRISTINA TO KARL LOBBYIST FOR THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION CDMA SUPPORTS THE CONTINUATION OF THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD IN STATUTES. AS WE'VE INDICATED IN OUR LETTER CDMA IS CONCERNED ABOUT SEVERAL SUBSTANTIAL FEE INCREASES INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTING A REGISTERED VETERINARY TECHNICIANS AND OUR GRADUATING STUDENTS WELL SEE THEM HE WANTS THE BOARD TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND HAVE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO SUCCEED. WE ALSO WANT TO SEE A POT FULL SPENDING PLAN AND AN END TO THESE INCREASES FOR THE TIME BEING. ALSO CDMA IS STRONGLY OPPOSED TO ANY ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE TELEMEDICINE WAIVER PERMANENT WHICH WOULD CREATE AN UNSAFE NEW STANDARD WHEREBY VETERINARIANS WOULD BE EXPECTED TO MAKE A VIDEO DIAGNOSIS FOR NEW CLINICAL CONDITIONS. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ANIMAL HEALTH AND SAFETY THAT FOR NEW CONDITIONS THE ANIMAL BE SEEN IN PERSON AND FINALLY WE WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK AND FOR INCLUDING ITEM NINETEEN. PERTAINING TO THE NEED FOR GREATER COLLABORATION AND COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE BMB AND THE BOARD OF PHARMACY ON ISSUES RELATED TO VETERINARY MEDICINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THE NEXT COMMENT IS FROM LINE NUMBER. TWENTY FIVE. CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MELANIE I RUN AN ANIMAL SHELTER IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA AND I SIT ON THE BOARD OF THE CALIFORNIA ANIMAL WELFARE ASSOCIATION. ARE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SHELTERS ARE RUN BY DEDICATED ANIMAL WELFARE PROFESSIONALS UTILIZED MINIMAL RESOURCES TO ADDRESS MAJOR ISSUES INCLUDING KEEPING ANIMALS SAFE AND PRACTICING HER HELP KNOWING WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR COMMUNITY TO KEEP THEIR PETS THANKS. TO THE JOB THAT THERE IS NO OVERSIGHT OF ANIMAL SHELTERS IN CALIFORNIA IS TOTALLY INCORRECT BE A CALIFORNIA STATUTE NOT ONLY- REQUIRING THAT SHELTERS EXCEPT THAT ALSO OVERSEEING THE CARE IN MANAGEMENT WITHIN THEIR SHELTERS. WE ARE NOT RIGHT THAT COULD BECOME QUARTERS UC DAVIS PROVIDE EXPERT ADVICE TO SHELTER THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES ON BASIC CARE ANIMAL SHELTER AND YET THEY WERE NOT INVOLVED IN THE ANIMAL SHELTER AND CROSS. RIGHT CONTINUING TO MOVE THESE REGULATIONS I WORK WITH THE EXPERTS HAND TIED TO PUBLIC COMMENT ONLY IT'S NOT ALLOWING FOR COLLABORATION AND FORWARD MOVEMENT THAT BENEFIT THE STATE ANIMAL IN FACT COUNTY ANIMALS MAY SEEM DESPERATE MARKET BUYER. REGARDING THIS ISSUE AND THAT'S BECAUSE THROUGHOUT THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS WE PROVIDE A COMMENT WHEN A LOUDAND VULGAR COMMENTS WERE DISREGARDED THE DMB IS TRYING TO ADDRESS A SINGLE ISSUE WITHOUT CONSIDERING ALL ASPECTS OF THE DECISION IF CALIFORNIA WANTS TO ALLOCATE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO ALLOW. ME CALIFORNIA CODE REQUIRED IN THE AND THE REGULATIONS GREAT WE'LL CALL OUR OBJECTION BUT WITHOUT THAT WE NEED TO BE COLLABORATIVE TO ADDRESS ISSUES I BELIEVE THERE ARE A VARIETY OF POSSIBILITIES WHEN THE BNP AND STAKEHOLDERS WORK TOGETHER TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. PLEASE CALL THESE REGULATIONS ENACTED BMB TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH UC DAVIS SHELTER MEDICINE TEAM HOW ANIMALS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE. A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL THANK YOU. THANKS KEVIN REPLY NINETEEN. MY NAME IS JOE PARKER AND I'M NOT OF THE ANIMAL WELL IF RECORD THE K. ANIMALS BROWDER'S. WE RESPECT REQUEST THAT THE MATT BOARD THE SHELTER RIGHT AND ALLOW FOR MORE STATE CALL AND BY TO CREATE A THAT WILL TO THE BACK CARE KERR OF SHELTER PETS IN ALIGNMENT WITH RESOURCES. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE FORTY BIG PERIOD IF IT'S A TO ADDRESS THE MAGNITUDE OF CHANGE THAT NEED TO BE MADE CREATE REGULATIONS THAT MAKE SENSE FOR SHELTERS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS THAT THESE REGULATIONS REQUIRE SHELTERS TO ATTAIN A VETERINARY PROMISED PERMIT TO CARRY OUT THEIR ESSENTIAL GOVERNMENT MANDATED DUTIES AND PROVIDE EVEN THE MOST BASIC CARE AND 25% OF SHELTER FACILITIES IN OUR STATE ARE SIMPLY UNABLE TO OBTAIN ONE. WITHOUT A PERMANENT THE VMB CONTENDS THAT SHELTERS ARE BREAKING THE LAW SHOULD BE ALLOWED TRAIN STAFF TO ADMINISTER THE VACCINES AND FLEA TREATMENTS AVAILABLE TO THE AVERAGE CITIZEN OVER THE COUNTER ANY FEED STORE THEIR STATING THAT ACCORDING TO THE NEW REGULATIONS THIS CAN BE DONE ACCORDING TO VETERINARY PROTOCOLS BY SHELTER STAFF BUT WHAT THEY'RE NOT MAKING CLEAR THAT THAT THIS DEPENDS UPON A VETERINARIAN TO PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE. TO OBTAIN A PERMIT PERMIT FOR THE SHELTER TO BEGIN WITH THE SHELTERS CANNOT FIND A VETERINARIAN TO DO THIS THEIR LACK OF THE ABILITY TO EUTHANIZE ANIMALS BUT NOT VACCINATE. THEM TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF DISEASE. THE REGULATIONS AS PRESENTED WILL BE CHOI DEVON. IF TO A BETTER OF. FOR EVEN THE MOST BASIC CARE KEITH BECAUSE- OF. HUNT OF NO OF THE- IN ORDER TO THE STATE IT'S- REQUIREMENTS. AND UPWARDS OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR TO EMPLOY VETERINARIAN ASSUMING THEY'RE EVEN ABLE TO FIND THEM. THESE REQUIREMENTS CONSTITUTE SIGNIFICANT UNFUNDED MANDATES ON LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES. FINDING A SOLUTION TO THIS MATTER IS IMPERATIVE AND ON BEHALF OF ALL OF THE ANIMALS AND PEOPLE WE SERVE. WE ASK THAT YOU HOLD THE BOARD ACCOUNTABLE TO WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS MATTER TO MAKE SOME. CHANGES NEEDED TO ENSURE THE ANIMAL SHELTERS STATEWIDE HAVE THE ABILITY TO COMPLY. THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THE NEXT IS FOR LINE FOR EIGHT LINE OPEN. HELLO MY NAME IS DR AT THE AND I BEEN IN CALIFORNIA LICENSE NERI. SENIOR I'M ALL THE NUMBER OF THE CAR THAT MEDICAL THIRTY. AND I AM CALLING INTO THE PATH TO BMD EIGHT ONE FIVE FIVE. ON ANIMAL REHABILITATION AND THE VETERINARIAN AND ANIMAL OWNER MYSELF I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE OPTION FOR PHYSICAL THERAPY IN MANY PARTS OF CALIFORNIA ARE VERY LIMITED. I DROVE OVER A HUNDRED MILES ONE WAY TO TAKE MY OWN DOG TO RECEIVE PHYSICAL THERAPY FROM AN EXCELLENT AND VERY FIELD PHYSICAL THERAPIST. THE THERE. ARE NOT ONLY WELL. AND ALL OF BUT THEY OPERA HELLO. OUTSIDE OF FROM. IN FIELD THAT NOTE THAT NAY THANK NOTES. WITH THAT MIGHT I WOULD TRAINED IN AT ALL YEAH PHYSICAL THERAPY AND I'VE BEEN ABLE TO CALL. WITH HAVE PROVIDED EXPERTISE AND- FAR BEYOND WHAT NO VETERINARIANS ARE TRYING TO DO. I BELIEVE THE VETERINARIAN AND THEN- OWNER CAN BE GIVEN SOME TWENTY AS TO WHAT LEVEL OF. THAT IT CAN. GIVE ANIMALS AND OWNERS MOST. AND BETTER TO CARE. VETERINARIAN HAVE A CHOI TO WHAT LED OF. THEY LIKE. TO FOR. WE ALLOW SINCE THERAPY TO WORK ON HUMAN WITH NO AND PRESIDENT. SO TO LIMIT AND EVEN MORE ON THE CARE AND ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE FOR. IN AND UP. LIFE ANIMALS WELFARE PLAN SEEMS TO ME THAT IT WOULD PROVIDE BETTER. FOR THE THAT ARE CONSIDERED LIKE THE FROM PEOPLE. OWNERS VETERINARIANS ONE THESE ARE. THERE WERE REQUIRE. TO SOMEONE PHYSICAL THERAPY WILL ENSURE PROP PIECE SELECTION AND- FOR THE- WHILE WORKING WITH PEOPLE THERAPIST I THOUGHT ANYTHING. FLIGHT PUT IN DANGER. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE SELECT COMMITTEES INCLUDE A RESOLUTION IN THE DMV SUNSET BILL AB ONE FIVE THREE FIVE. THAT WILL INCLUDE QUALIFIED INAPPROPRIATE LIKE ANIMAL PHYSICAL THERAPY AS LAWFUL PROVIDERS THE PANEL RECAP SERVICES. ALLOW THEM TO WORK UNDER THE DIRECT OR INDIRECT SUPERVISION OF A VETERINARIAN AND ANIMAL PHYSICAL REHABILITATION PREGNANT THAT IS REGISTERED WITH THE BOARD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR. CONSIDERATION ON THIS IMPORTANT MATTER. THE NEXT CAR FROM LINE NUMBER SO. HELLO MY NAME IS SCHUMER RPG. I ONE OF THE ONLY OF AN INDEPENDENT FIVE DR VETERINARY PRACTICE SERVING MENLO PARK ATHERTON AND REDWOOD CITY WHAT FORTY EMPLOYEE. I WAS THE LAST OF THE BMPS RBT. WHEN IT WAS DISSOLVED IN TWENTY ELEVEN WHICH LEGISLATION THAT ADDED THE ONE AND ONLY RPG TO THE PORT. I TESTIFY AT THE LASSEN SAID HEARING ABOUT THIS SEVERE SHORTCOMINGS AT THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD REGARDING RPG REGULATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT SINCE THE OR BTC WAS DISARMED. I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT THERE'S BEEN GOOD RESPONSE FROM THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD TO YOUR MANDATE THAT THEY FULFILL THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES TO REGULATE RPG MATTERS. THE NEW EXECUTIVE OFFICER HAS BEEN OUTSTANDING AND HELPING THE BOARD ACHIEVE THESE GOALS. THE ARMY KEEP FACES MANY CHALLENGES STILL. AS THE PMI PANDEMIC AS INCREASED ADOPTIONS THANKFULLY REDUCING SHELTER POPULATION IT HAS INCREASED THE BURDENS ON HOSPITALS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE PUBLIC WITH CONSISTENT HIGH QUALITY CARE. RPGS ARE CRITICAL TO ACHIEVING THAT. THE US LABOR STATISTICS HAVE PROJECTED 20% GROWTH OF RPGS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC THE PANDEMIC HAS REVEALED MANY STRESSES THAT MAKE FINDING AND RETAINING RPG WAS VERY DIFFICULT IN CALIFORNIA. I HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND HOW THE REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION AROUND RPG'S ATTACKS THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING ON THE VETERINARY STAFF ON THE FRONTEND. AND BURNED OUT AND CAREER CHANGE ON THE BACK AND. EXCESSIVE FEES AND THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIERRA. JUNGLE THE NEXT COMMENT IS FROM LINE THIRTY FIVE. CARILLO AND CHAIR ROSS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LEE HELLER I'M A LONGTIME ANIMAL WELFARE ADVOCATE I'M ALSO A FORMER PUBLIC MEMBER OF THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD AND I SERVED ON THE ANIMAL REHABILITATION TASK FORCE. AND I WANT TO ECHO WHAT SEVERAL PREVIOUS SPEAKERS AND SAID ABOUT THE FAILURE OF THE SUNSET REVIEW DOCUMENTS. TO PROPERLY COVER WHAT HAPPENED REGARDING THAT ISSUE WHICH IS THAT DOCTOR NOUNI AS AN ONLINE SERVED ON THAT BOARD- AND THAT THAT TASK FORCE. ENDORSED RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE THEN INCLUDED IN LEGISLATION BUT WHEN IT WENT TO THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD ONLY DOCTOR KNOWN AS AN ONLINE VOTED IN FAVOR OF THE TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS THE REST OF THE BOARD REJECTED THOSE TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONTINUE TO PURSUE A REGULATORY APPROACH. DOES NOT REFLECT BEST PRACTICES FOR ENSURING THAT ANIMALS GET PROPER PHYSICAL THERAPY OPTIONS IN CALIFORNIA SO I HOPE THAT YOU WILL LISTEN TO WHAT THESE OTHER CALLERS CAN SAID ALSO MEMBERS OF THE TASK FORCE AND LOOK FOR A LEGISLATIVE REMEDY SINCE THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD SEEMS UNABLE TO LISTEN TO THE LEGISLATURE OR TASK FORCE. I'M ALSO A LONGTIME ANIMAL WELFARE ACTIVISTS ON SHELTER MEDICINE ISSUES AND I WANT TO ECHO WHAT JILL PARKER AND OTHERS ABSTAINED AND ASK YOU TO INSIST THAT THE BOARD GO BACK TO GENUINE STAKEHOLDER CONVERSATIONS ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENED SO FAR DOES NOT REFLECT WHAT IS NEEDED FOR SHELTERS. TO BE ABLE TO COMPLY THANK YOU. THE NEXT COME IS FROM THREE SIX. HI MORNING MY NAME IS HILARY CONAN CAN I HAVE BEEN A PRACTICING VETERINARIAN AND MEMBER OF THE CDMA PURPORTING YOURS I'M ALSO AN ACUPUNCTURIST IN PRACTICE INTEGRATIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE SO EIGHTEEN MANY ANIMALS EACH WEEK WITH MOBILITY CONCERNS AND OR ORTHOPEDIC PAIN. I FEEL VERY FORTUNATE TO BE ABLE TO REFER TO A PHYSICAL THERAPIST IN MY AREA. I KNOW IT'S HIGHLY SKILLED AND EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS IN ENSURING SHE IS TREATING MY ANIMAL PATIENTS APPROPRIATELY AND IN LINE WITH MY DIAGNOSIS IN ORDER. SHE DID NOT REQUIRE MY DIRECT SUPERVISION OR WITH MY PATIENTS BENEFIT FROM HER BEING DIRECTLY SUPERVISED BY MYSELF. OR ANY OTHER VETERINARIAN THAT WOULD NOT SIMPLY TRAINED AND WE HAVE. I AM PROUD TO BE A THAT. BUT I WORRY THAT THE PUBLIC GENERAL RESPECT IN HIGH REGARD FOR OUR PROFESSION IS AT RISK IF THEY PERCEIVE THAT WE ARE LIMITING THEIR OPTIONS FOR QUALIFIED CARE. MY NUMBER OF THE CDMA THEY HAVE BEEN VERY DISAPPOINTED BY THEIR HANDLING OF THIS ISSUE. HAS BEEN MISLEADING INFORMATION SENT OUT TO MEMBERS AND THERE SEEMS TO BE A GENERAL UNWILLINGNESS TO COLLABORATE WITH THE PHYSICAL THERAPY PROFESSION. AND EMBRACE A MORE UNIFIED APPROACH TO ANIMAL HEALTH CARE. I HAVE EIGHT I SHOULD SAY I HAVE MANY COLLEAGUES NEAR AND FAR. IT FEELS SIMILAR TO THE WAY I DO. IT BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON ARE UNABLE TO BE HERE TODAY. WE BELIEVE THE CONSERVATIVE THINK TANK PROPERLY QUALIFIED ANIMAL PHYSICAL THERAPY SHOULD BE DIRECTLY SUPERVISED BY THAT. EVEN KNOWS ABOUT THAT HAVE A SPECIAL INTEREST IN REHAB DID NOT POSSESS THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS THAT EXTENSIVE TRAINING. AND YEARS OF HIGH LEVEL PRACTICE BRING TO A LICENSED PHYSICAL THERAPIST. ONE MORE BRIEF POINT I'D LIKE TO MAKE. I'VE HEARD SOME PEOPLE ARGUE THAT WE CANNOT APPLY THE SAME HUMAN MODEL TO ANIMALS BECAUSE- ANIMALS CAN'T VERBALIZE THEIR PAIN THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE. THE QUALIFIED ANIMAL PHYSICAL THERAPIST I HAVE ENCOUNTERED ARE EXTREMELY SKILLED IN PICKING UP ON THE SAME CLUES THAT ARE NEARING VIEWS TO INTERPRET DISCOMFORT IN AN ANIMAL. ANIMAL COMMUNICATION BEHAVIOR AND IDENTIFICATION OF PAIN ARE ALL INCLUDED IN THE CREEK EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR QUALIFIED ANIMAL PHYSICAL THERAPY AT. MAYBE EVEN MORE SO THAN IN. A TYPICAL DVM CURRICULUM. I ECHO. THE COMMENT. MANY OTHERS SPEAK. INCLUDING DR MARTIN GREENBERG. I RESPECTFULLY. TO BE A- AND SENATE JOINT COMMITTEE. A RESOLUTION BE IN THE SUNSET BILL. THAT WOULD INCLUDE QUALIFIED LICENSED ANIMAL PHYSICAL THERAPISTS AND LOCAL PROVIDERS OF ANIMAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND ALLOW THEM. OKAY THE NEXT TIME IT IS APPLYING FORTY ONE. GOOD MORNING LOW ROCK. I'M KEVIN AND I'M PRESSING ISSUE SIXTEEN AND ARE TURNING ISN'T PREVIOUS COMMENTS WHICH HIGHLIGHT A REALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION TRAMMELL ONE IT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW. WELL MEANING RECREATIONAL CANNABIS DISPENSARY STAFF IN CANNABIS ADVERTISING MAY WELL BE THE ONLY THING GUIDING TED OWNERS. AND REALLY THE ONLY PEOPLE ABLE TO PROPERLY DIAGNOSE AND RECOMMEND ARCHITECTURE AREA. AN EXAMPLE OF MY OWN CAT SORRY- CONDITIONS CAN'T AND COULD EASILY BE MISDIAGNOSED. YOUR RECREATION USE THAT FOR ANIMAL AND CANADA BASEMENT. IF IT IS MEDICINE AND I BELIEVE IT IS. SHOULD ONLY BE AVAILABLE WITH THE VETERINARIAN'S RECOMMENDATION AND SHOULD ONLY BE AVAILABLE IN THE MEDICAL CANNABIS DISPENSARY WITHOUT GETTING THE WHITE WE'RE WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO PUT THE TOOTHPASTE BACK IN THE TUBE. AND ACTIVELY GOING TO OPEN THE FLOODGATES HE GERRY SPARKLE IN DANGEROUS PRODUCT WITH NO SKILLED MEDICAL OVERSIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE ABILITY. TO COMMENT AND I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK. THE NEXT COMMENT IS FROM THE LINE NUMBER TWENTY. HI GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN LOW AND CHAIRMAN ROTH AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES MY NAME IS STEVEN RAGS AND I'M REPRESENTING THE ASPCA- ASPCA HARD TO ADD- ONE OF THE TOP HERE POLITICAL KEEPING. PEOPLE TOGETHER AND ONE OF THE WAYS DOWN- WE TRIED TO DO THAT IS INSURING THAT INDIVIDUALS AND HOUSEHOLDS THAT HAVE COMPANION ANIMALS HAVE ACCESS TO VETERINARY CARE. THE REALITY IS IN CALIFORNIA IN ADDITION JUPITER- THAT MERRY MEDICINE IN RURAL AREAS AND MANY OF OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES FOLKS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THAT HERE IN MADISON- COULD COMPLETE DESERT SQUARE FOLKS HAVE YOU- DRIVE LONG DISTANCES OR IN MANY CASES WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE VEHICLE. ACCESS TRANSIT AND OFTENTIMES GREENS THAT DOES NOT ALLOW. ANIMALS ON- VEHICLE SO- WE BELIEVE THAT- YOU THE BOARD REALLY NEED TO EXPLORE OPTIONS FOR ACCESS TO THAT CARE THEY'VE ALREADY INITIATED DEATH IN PART BY I'M LOOKING AT THE TEMPORARY WAIVERS FOR TELEMEDICINE AND WE APPLAUD THEM FOR PASSING THOSE AND- HOPE THAT WE CAN MAKE THOSE PERMANENTLY THINK THAT THAT IS ONE STEP. IN CREATING A MORE ACCESS TO THAT NEW CHAIR WE DON'T THINK THAT- BEING LOW INCOME MEANS THAT YOU YOU BOB YOUR COMPANION ANIMAL ANY LOOK ANY LESS THAN SOMEONE WITH MORE MEANS AND PEOPLE WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR ANIMALS- BUT OFTEN TIMES JUST DON'T HAVE. ON THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO TO HELP- SO WE WOULD ENCOURAGE- AT THE BOARD TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT WAYS TO CREATE MORE ACCESS AND- WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THE NEXT COMMENT IS FROM MY FORTY SEVEN. OUR. FIVE FORTY SO YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THE NEW COMEDIES FROM LINE NOT. THIRTY YOUR. NINE THIRTY EIGHT YOUR LINE IS OPEN. FIVE THIRTY EIGHT YOUR LINE IS OPEN.

THE CURRICULUM TO OBTAIN A DEGREE IN PHYSICAL THERAPY IS HEAVILY BASED ON MUSCULOSKELETAL ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. AND INCLUDES EXTENSIVE EDUCATION ON CRITICAL THINKING ATTACKING PAIN INVERTIBLE AND NONVERBAL PATIENT. MANUAL PALPATION AND AFFECTING THE JOINT MOBILITY AND NOT THE LINK MENTION IN VERBAL AND NONVERBAL. PATIENT AND USING CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS TO FORMULATE A TREATMENT PLAN BASED ON THE OUTCOME OF THE ASSESSMENT. THE CURRICULUM FOR AN RPG CAMPAIGNS AND NONE OF THAT. THERE ARE OTHER ARGUED HE'S ACTIVE IN THIS ISSUE WHO CONTEND THAT TEACHERS SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO WORK UNDER DIRECT SUPERVISION. OTHER VETERINARIANS. AT ALL TIMES TRYING TO JUSTIFY THE QUALIFIED WHAT HE'S LACK THE KNOWLEDGE TO RECOGNIZE PAIN IN ANIMALS AND DO NOT HAVE THE IDEAL ABILITY TO IDENTIFY RED FLAGS THAT WOULD NECESSITATE. THE ANIMAL BEING SEEN BY A VETERINARIAN. BEING PASSED BOTH A PT AND R. D. T. I CAN STATUS JUST. FALSE THE RACE. COURSEWORK OVER TO GO STANDARD AND I THINK. CURRENTLY FOR. RE HAD ANY U. S. OR T. T. ALREADY IN. PAYING RECOGNIZE AND RED FLAG I CAN THINK. TO ENSURE SAFETY OF THE ANIMAL PATIENTS I FEAR THAT SOME R. B. T. AT THE STATIONS AN INDIVIDUAL.

REQUEST SOME AMENDMENTS. THE THE ABILITY TO RECOMMEND NEEDS TO BE AUTHORIZED BY MARK PERSON. NOT JUST A CHANGE IN THE- VETERINARY PRACTICES ACT. DELEGITIMIZE THE RECOMMENDATION. VETERINARIANS DESPERATELY WANT AND NEED THE ABILITY AND THE AUTHORITY TO RECOMMEND- FOR ANIMALS CANNABIS IS MEDICINE PENSION REQUIRE A VETERINARIAN'S RECOMMENDATION- A MANUFACTURER'S ADVERTISING OR RETAIL SALES PERSON VICE. CANNABIS IS NOT A PANACEA AND A VETERAN VETERINARIAN IS THE ONLY PERSON THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO DIAGNOSE AND RECOMMEND THE TREATMENT OF ANY TIME- THIS BILL ALSO SOUNDS LIKE IT'S PROMOTING CANNABIS AT ADULT IN IS NO MENTION OF REFORMISTS ANIMALS AND HOW THEY SHOULD BE TREATED ALLOWING PERFORMANCE ORGANIZATIONS. TO ESTABLISH THEIR OWN CRITERIA.

THE EQUITY IF THE COALITION- REPRESENTING PHYSICAL THERAPISTS VETERINARIANS RPGS AND CONSUMERS AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING TO ESTABLISH COMMONSENSE ANIMAL TO SCHOOL CRAPPIE POLICIES IN CALIFORNIA FOR NUMBER OF YEARS. A GREAT HOPE OF THE COMMITTEES FOR THE SUNSET REVIEW HEARING ABOUT HER MEDICAL BOARD AND WE APPRECIATE SENATOR ROTH ASKING THEM ABOUT THIS ISSUE MAYBE IDENTIFY OURSELVES WITH- CARLA BINS STATEMENTS BEFORE. AND THE NUMBER OF- THE NUMBER OF. RIGHT NOW. AND AS SOON. AND- OUR AND THOSE LOVE TO ON THIS ISSUE ALREADY ARE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN ISSUE NUMBER FIFTEEN RELATING TO ANIMAL PHYSICAL REHABILITATION. OR PHYSICAL THERAPY THE ISSUE OF ANIMAL PHYSICAL REHABILITATION NEEDS A LEGISLATIVE FIX. HIM BY PROBLEM BOB PROMULGATING ITS REGULATIONS THE CURRENT REGULATION IS PROPOSING THE BORDERS ATTEMPTING TO ESTABLISHING UNIQUE SCOPE OF PRACTICE. SOLELY FOR VETERINARIANS THAT IS NOT SPECIFICALLY DESCRIBED OR DEFINED UNDER THE VETERINARY MEDICAL PRACTICE ACT. FURTHERMORE THE BOARD REGULATION DOES NOT RECOGNIZE LICENSED PHYSICAL THERAPIST WITH ADVANCED EDUCATION AND TRAINING CRISCO AND ANIMAL PHYSICAL THERAPY. EVERY INVOLVED INCLUDING THE BOARD AGREED THAT TO RECOGNIZE QUALIFY QUALIFIED LICENSED PHYSICAL THERAPIST WITH ADVANCED TRAINING ON ANIMALS REQUIRES LEGISLATION. SO WE- TO THE COMMITTEES TO INCLUDE A LEGISLATIVE FIX TO ALLOW QUALIFIED PHYSICAL THERAPISTS TO PRACTICE ON ANIMALS OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A CRISIS FOR MORE DISCUSSION AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH YOU ON A COOPERATIVE SOLUTION ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. WHAT THE NEXT COMMENT IS FROM THE LINE TWENTY EIGHT. HEY- MY NAME IS FUELING SOCIAL IN THE FROM NOT MISTAKEN I'M THE FIRST OUR CONSUMER OF ANIMAL PHYSICAL THERAPY SERVICES.

MY VETERINARIAN OFTEN KNOWS JUST. AS MUCH AS AS MUCH AS I DO HAVING BEEN IN THE ROOM AFTER SESSIONS WITH MY TAX- AT A LITTLE- ANECDOTE I THINK ABOUT HUMAN TO HAVE HIP SURGERY AND I THINK ABOUT. IF IT BECAME DIFFICULT OR UNAFFORDABLE FOR THEM TO GO TO PHYSICAL THERAPY AFTERWARDS I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYBODY WOULD WANT TO INTERFERE WITH HER INCREASE THE PRICE- OR PUT UP BARRIERS TO PET OWNERS GETTING. CARE FOR THEIR ANIMALS THAT WILL IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE AS LONG AS IT'S DONE IN A RESPONSIBLE FASHION SO- I AGREE WITH THE OTHER CALLERS TIME I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST RESOLUTION LANGUAGE AS RECOMMENDED BY THE STAKEHOLDERS TASK FORCE. BE INCLUDED IN AB ONE FIVE THREE FIVE- AND I JUST I REALLY ENCOURAGE THE BOARD TO LISTEN TO WITH THE DEPTH OF EXPERIENCE AND- THAT JUST WITH THE MULTITUDE OF STORIES OUT THERE AND IT MIGHT BE HARD FOR A LOT OF CONSUMERS TO CALL IN BECAUSE IT WAIT ON HOLD YOUR- NOSE NOT YOUR FIRST PARTY. BUT I TAKE IT FOR ME AND- AN EXPERT CONSUMER AND- THERE'S REALLY IN TO HAVE CUT ALLOW. HAVE ACT R. P. TO CHECK GET THEIR PATHS YEAH GET THE CARE THAT ISN'T.

GOOD MORNING NAME IS BRANDY CANCEL UP THE SAMPLE AT WHICH OPERATES BOTH THE NOW SHELTER IN TWO LARGEST HOSPITALS IN THIS. WITH TO ISSUE FOUR SHELTER. WE ASK THAT DMV WOULD DROP REGULATE AND CAN TO WORK THE STEAK TO REACH A BETTER. BUT THE FACT THAT I TO ONE DATA WHICH SHALL MANY THE AUTHORS ON THE ISSUE AT THAT POINT IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER ONLY QUESTION IN PARTICULAR. THE I. O. W. USED INVOLVEMENT IN THIS ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY THREE TELEMEDICINE I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT IT IS NOT OUR CONTENTION AT THE SHELTER THAT TELEMEDICINE IS CRITICAL BETTER THAN NOTHING. RATHER WE THINK THAT IS ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE IN MANY CIRCUMSTANCES TO USE TELEMEDICINE TO EXPAND IMPROVE VETERINARY CARE IN OUR STATE PARTICULARLY AMONG LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUALS. I THOUGHT COMMUNITY AND WORKING FAMILIES. LIKE IN HUMAN MEDICINE WE TRUST. PUT TO DETERMINE BY THE TELE. IS A- AND WHAT IT IS NOT THE TO OF LIKE SAMPLE THAT DR NEW NETSCAPE EARLIER THAN INSTANCE IN WHICH IT IS NOT WARRANTED. BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF APPROPRIATE USES RADIOLOGY PATHOLOGY PSYCHOLOGY CARDIOLOGY BEHAVIOR ONCOLOGY AND END OF LIFE HOSPICE CARE. AND WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT ANIMAL CANNOT COMMUNICATE NEITHER CAN YOUNG HUMAN AND YET ONE MIGHT HUMAN SON WAS AS YOUNG AS THREE MONTHS OLD I WAS ABLE TO CONTACT HIS POSITION VIA TELEMEDICINE TO DETERMINE IF CARE. THE NOTION THAT I CANNOT DO THE SAME FOR MY CAT AND INCONGRUOUS WITH THE GREAT LEVEL OF TRUST THAT WE PLACE IN OUR LIFE IS VERY. PROFESSIONAL THAT OUR STATE THANK YOU. THE COMMENT IS LINE FIFTY TWO. I CAN MORNING MISTER CHAIR MISTER CHAIR KAREN LAYING ON DOCTORS CAL ANIMALS AND THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER DID A GREAT JOB ON ISSUE NUMBER FOURTEEN RELATIVE TO THE REGULATION- AND ASKING THAT THE COMMITTEE JOINED TOGETHER REALLY PARKING SO THAT NETWORK TO PULL BACK THE REGULATIONS AND WE OPEN THEM AT THE STAKEHOLDER LEVEL AND ACTUALLY CORPORATION- COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY THE SHELTERS THEY DID WRITE SOMETHING LIKE SEVEN MOTHER EARTH I'M THROUGHOUT THE NDC PROCESS. IDENTIFYING THE ISSUE ABOUT OVER THE COUNTER MEDICATION I WANNA THAT'S NOT PRESENT AND IT WAS NEVER DEALT WITH AND THIS IS NOT A NEW ISSUE TO THE EXTENT THAT REVIEW PROCESS EITHER IT'S BEEN IN PREVIOUS FUNDS THAT REPORTTHE THING THAT IS NW NOW THOUGH IS THE DRAFT REGULATIONS AND WHEN THEY ARE ADOPTED AND IMPLEMENTED. YOU ARE JUST YOU'RE JUST PUTTING YOURSELF THERE'S A NOT A REALLY TOUGH SPOT THERE ARE COUNTIES IN THE STATE WITHOUT A SINGLE VETERINARIAN PRACTICING AND THEN ZERO LICENSEES THAT IF THE PERFECTLY THE COUNTY OF ALPINE BUT THEY ARE STILL OBLIGATED TO DELIVER ANIMAL CARE AND CONTROL OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT THEY DON'T HAVE THE OPTION TO. GET A PRIVATE CONNECT AND FURTHERMORE AS THE COMMITTEE HEARD TODAY THAT SHELTERS WITHOUT VETERINARIANS CAN STILL GET THE PROTOCOLS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE OVER THE COUNTER MEDICATION THE- THAT THE KEY THERE WHICH YOU CANNOT LOSE SIGHT OF IS THAT THEY FIRST MUST HAVE A PROMISED PERMITS TO GET THOSE PROTOCOLS YOU CAN'T GET THE PROMISED PERMITS UNTIL YOU HAVE A PLAN F. WHICH MEANS BUILDING ASSEMBLY AT LEAST A SMALL VETERINARIAN OFFICE. AT THE SHELTER THE COUNTIES THAT HAVE DONE THAT THE SMALL EXERCISE TO PUT FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT COST ONE COUNTY ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND NOT IF THEY CAN GET BETTER DURING THE COLD WORK AT THEM THAT THEY CAN GET THE PROTOCOLS FROM THE THAT NETWORK FROM PARK I. AND THAT THE ALLIES UNTIL THEY HAVE A PER ABOUT PROTOCOL IN FOR YOU GOT EARLY DOESN'T WORK AND COUNTY TENS OF MILLION OF DOLLARS SO I YOU TO PLEASE. PRACTICE THAT. THE POLICY OF THE LEGISLATURE IS ON THE LINE FIFTY THREE. THIS MORNING MY NAME IS DR JENNY MILL I'M CALLING TO DRESS THE CURRENT REGULATIONS REGARDING ANIMAL REHABILITATION. I'VE BEEN A LICENSED PHYSICAL THERAPIST IN CALIFORNIA FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS AND A CERTIFIED CANINE REHABILITATION THERAPISTS FOR OVER ELEVEN. I ALSO HOLD AN ANIMAL CRITICAL THERAPY LICENSE IN NEVADA AND I AM THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE ANIMAL TO THE GOT THERE PEACEABLE INTEREST GROUP OF THE PTA. MY ROLE TODAY IS NOT TELLING THE DIFFICULTIES THAT I FACED WITH THE CURRENT PROPOSED REGULATION TO PHYSICAL THERAPISTS I ANIMAL REHAB. BUT INSTEAD I'LL PROVIDE YOU WITH SOME. PERSPECTIVE ON FROM POLLUTION. THE PHYSICAL THERAPY IN VETERINARY VOICE CAME TOGETHER AND IT A GREEN CONCERT AT THE- EXPERIENCE IN LIFE AND REQUIRE. HE HE'S- ALL THE WORK AND INDIRECT SUPERVISION WITH A BETTER VERSE. SIMILAR OUR PRACTICE AND HUMAN ANNA. STEP MODEL IT PREVENT SUCCESSFUL AND PREFERRED BY VETERINARY COMPETE AWAY. I WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE COMMUNITY THEME WITHIN A TEN THAT AND PROVIDE CLUB CARE FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT RISK. AND THIS EXPENSES OF THE DIRECT MÃ . CALIFORNIA WOULD BENEFIT FROM ADOPTING THIS MODEL ALLOW APPROPRIATELY CERTIFIED PHYSICAL THERAPISTS TO ADD THEIR EXPERTISE AND CLINICAL SKILLS TO THE FIELD OF ANIMAL REHABILITATION. THE WEIGHTLESS AND THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA ARE NOW OVER TWO MONTHS LONG TRIP CUT NEEDING BRAIN. EVEN THOUGH WE MORE CLINICS THAT MOST AREAS I HAPPENED TO BE IN THE INCLUDE RESOLUTION LANGUAGE TO REFLECT THE STAKEHOLDERS TASK FORCE LANGUAGE. AS IT RELATES TO QUALIFY PC'S WORKING WITH ANIMAL TO BE INCLUDED IN THE SENSE THAT EXTENSION BILL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. THE NEXT COMMENT IS FROM FIFTY FOUR. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK MY NAME IS DOCTOR LEE STEVENS AND I'M A SUPERVISING VETERINARIAN FIRST OUT HOW. IT'S A PLACE THAT DOES TO THE GOAL REHABILITATION ON ANIMALS AND I'VE BEEN THERE FOR THIRTEEN PLUS YEARS I THINK QUALIFY P. T. SHOULD BE ABLE TO WORK ON ANIMALS SO THAT THEY CAN WORK UNDER INDIRECT SUPERVISION OF A VETERINARIAN. THE PROCESS WAS VERY FRUSTRATING WHEN I WENT BEFORE THE B. AND B. AND I FELT THAT THE COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC WORKS TOTALLY IGNORED FOR EXAMPLE A MORE OF THE PUBLIC OPPOSED THE LANGUAGE AND YET THE REGULATION IN THE OPINION WAS ALREADY WRITTEN BEFORE THE HEARING AND THEN IT WAS VOTED ON IN THE SAME MEETING WITHOUT ANY CHANGES. I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BE A LEGISLATION ADDITIONALLY HOW MOTIVATING HEARING WHO CARRIED THE PREMISE PERMITTED BY THE LEVEL OF SUPERVISION. FOR THE P. T. THEY WORK WITH. THE CONSUMER CHOICES LIMITED. AND THE PUBLIC HAS. THAT TO QUALIFIED- I. HOW ABOUT OF HAVING A TRAIN P. T. WHO'S MADE A CHOICE TO WORK WITH ANIMALS- AND YOU'VE BEEN. FREQUENTLY FROM THERE TO. IN A- OF. THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY COVERED IN VETERINARY EDUCATION. TEACHER TRAINED ON HANDS ON. MANUAL CARE AND I HAVE PERSONALLY SEEN THE IMPROVED OUTCOMES FOR THE PATIENTS THAT COME TO US FOR A SECOND OPINION. AFTER YOU KNOW BEING ELSEWHERE. AT UC DAVIS pRELATING TO SPORTS MEDICINE KINESIOLOGY OR BIO MECHANICS IT. IN THE VETERINARY CURRICULUM AND MODALITIES LIKE JOINT MOBILIZATIONS AREN'T EVEN HOT. AND YET VETERINARIANS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO DICTATE WHAT THE- TREATMENT PLAN SHOULD BE. AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE TRAINING TO DO THAT. ADDITIONALLY ACCORDING TO THE YOU CAN BE THAT BAD WEBSITE THERE ARE NO FOURTH YEAR STUDENT ROTATIONS LISTED FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF ANIMAL. PHYSICAL REHABILITATION. AND THE ACCOUNT DEPARTMENT ITSELF IS RUN BY A- COLD. CREDENTIALED PHYSICAL THERAPIST WITH EXTENSIVE HUMAN AND ANIMAL EXPERIENCE. FINALLY HAVE PEACE HE IS NO THEY CAN'T MAKE DIAGNOSES IN HUMAN MEDICINE. AND THE TEACHINGS THAT I'VE WORKED WITH TO WORK WITH ANIMALS NO DESK. AND WILL REFERRAL WHEN THERE'S AN ISSUE. IF THERE'S A CASE FELT BILL SEND THE CASE BACK TO THE VETERINARIAN OR SAID. SUGGESTED THEY GO TO SEE A SPECIALIST. OR IN OUR CASE THAT WORK THEY CALL ME I'M ONLY A TEXT AWAY. TO TEETH WERE DOING PHYSICAL REHAB THANK YOU VERY MUCH CONSCIENTIOUS AND BITUIN THAT PRACTICES HERE THAT. THE NEXT. COMMENT IS FROM LINE FIFTY ONE. CARILLO CAROL THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY COMMON. MY NAME IS DR CHRIS REID I'M A DOCTOR THERAPY. AND CARACOL POINT THAT THE THEIR BEAT THE ASIAN GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. ONLY THINK THIS WILL HAVE FOR THEIR WORK. AND IT'S GOING COMMITTEE FOR THE INCLUSION OF ITEM FIFTEEN RELATED TO THE PROVISION OF ANIMAL PHYSICAL REHABILITATION SERVICES BY PHYSICAL THERAPIST. I ECHO THE COMMENTS AND SUPPORT EXPRESSED BY OTHERS FOR THE INCLUSION THE LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION AND ALLOW THE ETERINARIAN. TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF SUPERVISION REQUIRED RIPARIAN ANIL PATIENT. PHYSICAL THERAPIST FOR CARE THANK YOU. IN THE NEXT COUPLE IS FROM. THIRTY EIGHT. HELLO MY NAME IS JUANITA SMITH AND I'M A RESIDENT OF SANTA BARBARA COUNTY AND I AM OPPOSED TO THE REGULATIONS OF THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD- I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT I'VE WORKED IN APPREHENSION DOG AND TO. SEARCH AND RESCUE DOGS- AND GETS A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND I HAD DEPLOYED- MY DOG ON THE MONEY IF YOU DON'T MIND LIKE HERE IN CALIFORNIA- IN SEARCH FOR THE MACHINE AND- WE WERE ABLE TO GET. A VETERINARIAN TO WORK WITH US AS WELL AS THE- QUALIFIED REGISTERED PHYSICAL THERAPIST. AND THE DOGS AT WORK AT MONASH SETO MUD SLIDE WERE GIVEN A PHYSICAL THERAPY BASED UPON THE DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATION. AND WE CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE WAS AT LEAST A 90% IMPROVEMENT THE NEXT DAY OF THESE WORKING DOGS THESE DOGS ARE WORKING THE NIGHT THAT WAS CHEST DEEP FOR HUMANS. AND THE DOGS WHO DOES PHYSICALLY EXHAUSTED AND SORE- THE NEXT DAY AFTER RECEIVING PHYSICAL THERAPY ARE THEIR PERFORMANCE IMPROVED- I HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE VETERINARY BOARD. SPECIFICALLY IT WILL REDUCE ACCESS TO I NEED TO RE HAVE BEEN. WE HAVE REHAB SERVICES FOR THE WORKING DOG TO SERVE OUR STATE MON FORTUNATELY KQ. AND- THE REGULATIONS SPECIFICALLY DO NOT MEET THE STATED OBJECTIVE OF PROTECTING THE CONSUMERS BECAUSE THEY FAIL TO REQUIRE ANY EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR. AN RV HE- THERE TODAY PRACTICE IN A SPECIALTY THAT THEY ARE NOT TAUGHT AS PART OF THEIR COOL CORRECTLY ON. CANNOT FEEL PRESSURE IF THEY'RE BEING PROTECTED FROM BAD ACTORS IN THE INDUSTRY IF COMPETENCY STANDARDS ARE NOT SET- I ANNA. DISSATISFIED WITH HOW THE VETERINARYWORK HAS HANDLED THIS I'VE TRIED TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM VERY INCLINED TO VERY I JUST FELT LIKE MY CONCERN TEAM OUR REGULAR. AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS POINT. NINE FORTY SEVEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN. AND I LINE FORTY SEVEN. YOUR LINE IS OPEN AND WE HEAR YOU OKAY HI MY NAME IS NANCY ERLICH RBT AS I'VE BEEN LICENSE SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE I'VE BEEN ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN R. V. T. ACTIVITIES FOR A VERY LONG TIME I WAS A MEMBER OF THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOYS RBT COMMITTEE FROM NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT TO TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND CHAIR FOR NINETY NINE NINETY TWO THOUSAND ONE. AND I'M CURRENTLY THE CALIFORNIA RBTH SOCIAIS HAITIANS REGULATORY LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE I ONG INVOLVEMENT WITH RBC ISSUES GIVE ME A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON THE CURRENT SITUATION THE FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE TO RBC'S RIGHT NOW WITH THE ENORMOUS FEE INCREASE PLACE ON R. V. T. THE APPLICATION AND LICENSE FEES OR RATES FROM A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS. THAT'S UNCONSCIONABLE HUNDRED AND 75% INCREASE ON EACH THE THREE OF THESE PLANS TO LOWER THE RBC LICENSE PLATE NO TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS NEXT YEAR WELL WELCOME STILL RATED THE SUBSTANTIALLY WE FEEL IT IS UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT A RELATIVELY LOW PAID RBT PROFESSION TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE TYPE THING. ONE OF THE MOTIVATION FOR ELIMINATING THE RETURN THE CALIFORNIA ARMY TEAMS AND SEVERAL YEARS AGO WAS TO ELIMINATE THE TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR EXAM FEE SO THAT RBT APPLICANTS WOULD BE ABLE TO AFFORD GETTING LIFE AND RAISING THE FEES IS NEGATED THAT REMEDY AND WE STILL HERE THE NEW GRADUATION DECLINED TO GET LIKE FIFTY TO SIXTY. ONE OF THE REASONS GIVEN BY THE VMB FOR RAISING RBT PIECES THE INCREASE IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE HOWEVER SINCE I REPEAT MAKE UP JUST ZERO POINT 001% OF DISCIPLINARY CASES IT'S NOT REASONABLE TO EXPECT RB DIESEL UNDERWRITE THE COST. OF DISAPPOINTING OTHER LICENSEES. WE ALSO UNDER THAT SOME OF STATES NOT RELY ENTIRE ON LIFE. HE'S TO THE THEIR BOARD. HAS THE PUBLIC BETTER FROM. BEING LIKE. WE RECOMMEND THE LEAD. TO ALL. WAYS OF SUPPORTING LICENSING BOARD. SO THAT RELATIVELY LOW PAID LIFE HE'S LIKE RV KEYS. DO NOT HAVE TO CARRY SUCH A LARGE FINANCIAL BURDEN. NEXT TO IT AT THE LEGISLATURE TO POCKET THE SECOND R. V. P. ON THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD. WE REALIZE THAT GIVING UP THE RBC FOUR ONE RB DION THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD AT THE MEASURE THE INFLUENCE OF RBT ISSUES. HAVING ONLY ONE RBT ON THE BOARD ALSO MEANS THAT WHEN THAT PERSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT THERE IS. TWO MINUTES THANK YOU. CONNECT COMMENT IS FROM LINE. SIXTY ONE. HELLO MY NAME IS KRISTEN TAYLOR AND I'M A REGISTERED VETERINARY TECHNICIAN IN CALIFORNIA AND I AM ALSO A VETERINARY TECHNICIAN BHANSALI'S AND ACCESSIBLE REHABILITATION. I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS FROM HERE LIKE- ARGUED HE ABOUT THE FEE INCREASE AND HOW UNCOMFORTABLE THAT IS FOR OUR V. PEAS IN CALIFORNIA THE HOBBIT REYES TO THE DOCTORS FOR A BACK MOM AND THAT NEEDS TO BE RECTIFIED AND INTERACT WITH OTHER- ISSUE. ALSO SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT BEEN LOOK THAT IS DEEPER TITLE PROTECTION FOR REGISTERED VETERINARY TECHNICIANS THAT CALIFORNIA THERE IS ZERO ENFORCEMENT FOR IT OR ANY DISCIPLINARY ACTION INVOLVED I BELIEVE THAT THE THIRTEEN AT POLICY WAS IN PLACE TO DETERMINE THAT FROM HAPPENING THIS WOULD HELP INCREASE THE NUMBER OF RDPC. IN CALIFORNIA AND IS CURRENTLY IMPROPER USE OF OUR TERM ENTITLED. ADDITIONALLY I SUPPORT THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD VISION FOR THE ANIMAL PHYSICAL REHABILITATION AS A R. D. T. AND CALIFORNIA I HAVE GREAT CONCERNS OVER RVP. INFRINGEMENT ON TAP. ACTUALLY SUCH THING AS KATHLEEN AND THE ENERGY. WHICH IS SOMETHING THE CAN ALL HAPPEN INSTEAD REVIEW. ADDITIONAL RBP ARE REQUIRED TO. WITH A VETERINARIAN WITH A WITH A VETERINARY CLIENT PATIENT RELATIONSHIP AND HOW IS IT GOING TO BE ADDRESSED. SURE THE CRITICAL THERAPIST WITH TRAINING AND PHYSICAL REHABILITATION OF THE SEPARATE CRIME AND WITHOUT A BETTER NAZARIAN SEEN THE PATIENT I THOUGHT HI. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE NEXT COM IS FRONTLINE. THANK YOU- COMMITTEE ON BUSINESS PROFESSIONS AND THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON BUSINESS QUESTIONS NOTHING ON A DEVELOPMENT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE THE DURING COMMITTEES FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN THE CMB WAS UNDERGOING EXTENSIVE REVIEW IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SADLY I'M HERE AGAIN TESTIFIED THE FOURTEENTH YOU NEED CONCERNING CONTACT AS IT RELATES TO HOW THE ANNUAL PHYSICAL THERAPY. REHABILITATION ISSUE HAS BEEN HANDLED MY NAME IS TURNOUT LISTEN I'VE BEEN A LICENSED PT IN THE STATE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS I'LL HOLD A CERTIFICATION AND TRAINING REHABILITATION FROM THE CANINE REHAB INSTITUTE AND I'M A CLINICAL INSTRUCTOR FOR PTC. DVM RPGS. ACTOR THE SPECS SPECIALTY NICHE OF PANAMA REHAB. I'M ALSO A FAN MEMBER AND CURRENT PRESIDENT OF BOTH THE CAL SYSTEM OF ANIMAL. THERAPIST AND ANIMAL CRITICAL THERAPY COALITION- AT THE MANY OF MY COMMENTS AND- WERE ALREADY SPOKEN BY MANY OF THE PRIVATE ABOUT THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS. SO IN THE INTEREST OF SAVING TIME I WILL JUST ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THOSE MADE BY SCOUT HOUSE- LISA STARK. AND THOSE ALSO- BY DR GREENSON SUCKERS CONUS AND GREENSBURG. AND THE OTHERS THAT ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THEM ARCANE POSITION. WHERE ALL AGREED EVEN IF THE BOARD IS THAT THE ONLY SOLUTION THAT CAN FULLY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND PROVIDE. FOR QUALIFIED TEACHERS TO PERFORM ANIMAL PHYSICAL THERAPY IS TO MAKE A STATUTORY CHANGE BY THE LEGISLATURE. JUST AS OUR NEIGHBORING STATES AND SUCCESSFULLY DONE MANY YEARS AGO. UNFORTUNATELY THE BOARD HAS IGNORED ALL STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS ISSUE AND CREATED THEIR OWN BIASED NARRATIVE. YES THEY PROVIDED THE REQUIRED TIME TO SPEAK. BUT THEY FAIL THE FAIRLY COLLABORATE WITH ANYONE TO FIGHT FOR THAT THE QUESTION AT LEAST THAT IS THE PERCEPTION. ACCOUNTABILITY NEEDS TO MATTER. FOR THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF PET IN SERVICE AND WORKING ANIMALS IN NEED A PT SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ANIMAL PHYSICAL THERAPIST IN THE ANIMAL PHYSICAL THERAPY COALITION ASKED THE COMMITTEES TO INCLUDE THE PHONE SEX. TO INCLUDE IN THE SUNSET EXTENSION BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH IMPLEMENT. THE TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATION. THE NEXT COMMENT IS FROM SIX FOUR. HELLO THANK YOU FOR- TO THE COMMITTEE FOR A PICKING A CALM MY NAME IS DR GARY RICHTER I AM A VETERINARIAN. AND I AM A CO FOUNDER OF THE VETERINARY CANADA SOCIETY A NONPROFIT WHOSE MISSION IT IS TO EDUCATE VETERINARIANS PET OWNERS AND INDUSTRY ABOUT THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS FOR ANIMALS. I WANNA TALK TODAY VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY FOUR WHICH ADDRESSES WHICH WHICH ADDRESSES ONE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE FACING CALIFORNIA VETERINARIANS AND PET OWNERS THIS BILL WOULD PRINT- THE BILL WOULD PREVENT THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD. FROM DISCIPLINING A VETERINARIAN FOR RECOMMENDING CANNABIS AND THIS IS A HUGE BENEFIT FOR THE VETERINARY COMMUNITY AND THAT BETTER HEARINGS WOULD BE PERMITTED TO HAVE. CRITICAL CONSULTATIONS WITH OUR CLIENTS ABOUT PATIENT CARE. IN ADDITION BY LIFTING THIS PROHIBITION THE VETERINARY PROFESSION WILL BE INCENTIVIZED TO BECOME EDUCATED ABOUT THE USE OF CANNABIS RAMBLES WHICH IN TURN OF COURSE BENEFITS PETS. AND PET OWNERS. THE BILL HOWEVER IS DEEPLY FLAWED. EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY FOUR FAILED TO AMEND MY CURSOR WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR A TRUE RECOMMENDATION BY VETERINARIANS IN THE SAME WAY TO POSITIONS HAVE BEEN DOING SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND REALLY. ALL THING THAT AB THREE FOUR DOES IS PER DAY AT THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD FROM DISAPPOINTING VETERINARIANS TO RECOMMEND CANNABIS FOR THEIR PATIENTS. FURTHERMORE THE BILL MAKES NO MENTION OF REQUIRING MEDICAL CANNABIS PRODUCTS LABELS FOR ANIMALS TO BE SOLD TO MEDICAL DISPENSARIES ONLY. THIS IS THIS THIS SHOULD BE A COMMONSENSE NECESSITY THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS RECREATIONAL CANNABIS FOR ANIMALS. BY NOT AMENDING THE CURSOR AND ALLOWING MEDICAL CANNABIS PRODUCTS TO BE SOLD ALL ITS TO BE SOLD TO RECREATIONAL DISPENSARY. EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY FOUR EFFECTIVE MOVING THE GATE A GREAT DEAL OF THE VALUE OF VETERINARIANS BEING ABLE TO RECOMMEND. BECAUSE ANYONE OFF THE STREET WILL BE ABLE TO BUY A PRODUCT LABELED FOR ANIMALS AND MINISTERED TO THEIR PETS WITH NO VETERINARY GUIDANCE. RECALL OUT REGARDING DOSING- EVEN IF CANNABIS IS AN APPROPRIATE MEDICATION FOR THAT PATIENT. THE WHOLE POINT OF VETERINARIANS INSISTING ON BEING ABLE TO RECOMMEND IS TO PROTECT PATIENTS FROM ACCIDENTAL HARM TO THE INAPPROPRIATE ADMINISTRATION OF THIS OF CANNABIS PRODUCTS. SO LET ME JUST BE CLEAR THAT THE ONLY REASON WHY ANYBODY WOULD WANT MEDICAL CANNABIS FOR ANIMALS AND RECREATIONAL DISPENSARIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE PROBLEM A MEASURE TO YOUR TEAMMATES ARE CONCLUDED. AN OPERATOR WILL JUST LEAVE ROOM FOR ONE ADDITIONAL CALLER SO THAT WE CAN GET ON TO THE NEXT. SUNSET OVERSIGHT HEARING. MISTER CHAIRMAN THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENTS AT THIS POINT. WONDERFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. I WANT TO THANK- THE BOARD AND ALSO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER.

INCREASE THE NUMBER OF- INCREASING THE NUMBER OF MENTAL HEALTH. PROVIDERS IN OUR UNDERSERVED AREAS. AND HOW CAN WE HELP I WILL TELL YOU THAT THIS IS AN AREA THAT I KNOW. SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES TO JOIN ME IN BEING CONCERNED ABOUT- SO HOW'S THAT OF FUN WORKING AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO IMPROVE. YES MISTER. GENERADO AND THE- LAWS OF THE ACTING GHOSTED BINDING POSTS MORE ON THAT FRONT AS WELL. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS I WOULD HAVE TO GET BCK ON THE ACTUAL NUMBERS THAT HAVE- TO INCREASE FROM THE INCREASE IN THE FEE AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF RECIPIENTS GOES- WE TYPICALLY GET A PRESENTATION FROM THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION FOUNDATION TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE- FUND IS WORKING AND HOW MANY RECIPIENTS ARE RECEIVING- THOSE LOAN REPAYMENT OF FUNDS. THERE IS ALSO ACCESS TO THE PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE FUND- WHICH CODES TO LICENSEES ABOVE THE BORDER BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES AS WELL AS THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY SO THERE ARE AS SEPARATE FUNDS THAT- LICENSEES CAN ACCESS. LOAN REPAYMENT PURPOSES. WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT RESPONSE I WOULD APPRECIATE SOME ADDITIONAL- DETAILED INFORMATION OBVIOUSLY THIS IS BEEN A PROBLEM UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY IN THE INLAND PARTS OF THE STATE BUT NOT RESTRICTED TO THOSE AREAS FOR A LONG TIME IT IS AS I AS YOU KNOW. PARTICULARLY ACUTE NOW WITH THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC POST IN OUR SCHOOLS AND OUTSIDE OF OUR SCHOOLS SO THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WOULD BE HELPFUL AND I'D LIKE TO WHEN YOU WENT WHEN YOU INCLUDE THAT. PLEASE ALSO INCLUDE THE AREAS WHERE WE CAN HELP YOU- HELP ALL THE REST OF US- WITH RESPECT TO- MEDIC MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS IN OUR UNDERSERVED AREAS QUESTION NUMBER TWO DIFFERENT TO DIFFERENT SUBJECT AREA. HAS TO DO WITH RESEARCH PSYCHOANALYST'S AND THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS DOES THE BOARD LEAVE IT SHOULD OVERSEE. THE REGISTRATION OF THE THIS CLASSIFICATION RESEARCH- PSYCHOANALYST'S- WHO ARE CURRENTLY IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING REGISTERED BY THE AND REGISTERED WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD. I CAN RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION- JUST GIVEN ROTH. MISTER PSYCHOANALYSIS HAVE BEEN UNDER THE MEDICAL BOARD ASSEMBLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES- HISTORICALLY PSYCHOANALYSTS WERE INDIVIDUALS WITH MEDICAL DEGREES- AND THEN THEY WERE SANTEE TRUST LITIGATION AND THE AREA OPENED UP TO. ADDITIONAL TYPES OF PRACTICE HERE'S- PEOPLE GOING INTO PSYCHOANALYSIS NOW ARE TYPICALLY NOT PSYCHIATRISTS- MOSTLY CATERS TO NOT PRACTICE EVEN PSYCHOTHERAPY LUDLUM PSYCHOANALYSIS- I BELIEVE. THE MOBILE LOGICAL PLACE TO PUT TO RECYCLE HOURS WITH THE BOARD ITSELF IS NOT ACTUALLY HAS NOT ACTIVELY CONSIDERED IT DID COME UP IN THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SUNSET REVIEW- WE WERE NOT DELEGATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS RESEARCH CYCLE ANALYST AT THAT TIME- WE'RE CERTAINLY OPEN TO CONSIDERING RESEARCH CYCLE BOSS. BEING MOVED OR BOARD- GIVEN THAT THERE MAY BE MORE WITH OUR AREA OF EXPERTISE AND IN FACT MOST OF THEM- TEACH AT- RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES TO THAN THAT. WELL IN THEORY AND TO REGULATION THEY BE DOING READ AND PUBLICATION IN ADDITION TO CLINICAL PRACTICE IN THE CLINICAL PRACTICES MUST BE RESTRICTED TO ABOUT. A THIRD OF THEIR TIME. CHAU TYPICALLY THEIR- SUPERVISION. AND THEY'RE DOING PUBLISHING AND THE AREA OF SUBPRIME ALICE'S- TWO WEEKS NOT. MEDICALLY RELATED. BUT AS I SAY THE BOARD'S TAKING NO FORMAL POSITION ON- TAKE UP RESEARCH. AS OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS YET TO MAKE A DETERMINATION THAT AREA JUST ONE MORE FOLLOW UP BUT I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS WHICH IS WHY I'M ASKING IT CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME IDEA- IF THEY'RE NOT MEDICAL DOCTORS- WHAT THE EDUCATE THE GENERAL EDUCATION BACKGROUND IS OF THIS POPULATION OF INDIVIDUALS. THERE PEOPLE WOULD NON MENTAL HEALTH AGREES WHICH IS WHY IT BECOME RESEARCH PSYCHOANALYSTS BECAUSE YOU'RE A FULL FLEDGED PSYCHOANALYST YOU HAVE TO HAVE EITHER APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY MEDICAL RATE- REPLIED SOCIAL WORK DEGREE AT THE I MEAN ANYTHING RELATED. TO THE PLOT MENTAL HEALTH AREA- SO TYPICALLY IT MIGHT HAVE A PHD AND SOMETHING LIKE COST FEE. SOME CRITICISM HISTORY- A BIG RUNS THE GAMUT- PUTS THE TYPICAL BULLET DON'T COME OUT OF A FORMAL EDUCATION AND MENTAL HEALTH WHEN THEY COME OUT OF. AN ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE AND- IN FACT I GUESS. WE'RE SORT OF BECOME CREATURES CHECK. HOURS SO. IT IS A PRIMARY OF P. DESERVES SMALL GROUP CYCLES CAL. I THINK IT'S A BROWN FIFTY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE VERY INTERESTING THANK YOU A MIXTURE. DAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW IN ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COULD MEMBERS- SENATOR PANFILO BY SENATOR ARTICULATED. THANK YOU CHAIR- LOW AND CHIRAC- THE FIRST OF ALL- APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION- I KNOW WHEN THE QUESTIONS I NORMALLY ASK. OUR CV MONITORING BUT I SEE THAT THIS BOARD ACTUALLY DOESN'T LOOK LIKE FIGURES ON A LOT OF GREAT. HE GETTING THEIR CONTINUING EDUCATION SO THAT GREAT- I. DID HAVE A COUPLE THINGS I WANT TO ASK ABOUT SO. FIRST OF ALL I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING IN TERMS OF- IN TERMS OF BACKLOG ENFORCEMENT SO FOR THEY UNDERSTAND YOU USE BREEZE. SECTOR SIX HOW MUCH MONEY DO DOES THE BOARD OF THE QUALITY SPENT ON GREASE MAINTENANCE I CAN'T QUITE PARSE IT OUT FUND EXPENDITURES- THE CHART. MISTER OUR LAST FISCAL YEAR THE BOARD SPENT A HUNDRED AND SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ON BREEZE COSTS- COSTS HAVE VERY THROUGH THE YEARS BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF WORK INCLUDE GOING INTO THE BREEZE PRODUCT- AND A CERTAIN NUMBER OF RELEASES- THE VENDOR CHANGES THE AMOUNT BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THE PROGRAMS- TYPICALLY PRO RAT IT WILL SPREAD THOSE COSTS TO LARGER PROGRAMS AND SMALLER PROGRAMS- AND IT HAS NOT BEEN AN ISSUE FOR OUR PASSWORD- THUS FAR. APPRECIATE THAT- PERHAPS WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOU SEE MORE BROADLY ACROSS THE BOARD SO I JUST AS THE VARIATION TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOR VETERINARY AGAIN YOU MAY BE USING IT DIFFERENTLY AND SO FORTH WELL I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING HOW MUCH TOTAL MONEY WE'RE SPENDING ON THIS PROGRAM AND WHAT BENEFITS WERE GETTING FROM IT AT THE OTHER QUESTION I ACTUALLY HAD WAS- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT- THAT ALSO COME UP IS- CERTAINLY WE ALL APPRECIATE HOW IMPORTANT MENTAL HEALTH IS ESPECIALLY NOW WITH KOBE- MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ARE A PARTICULAR YOU KNOW SENSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CLIENT. PATIENTS THAT INTO TERMS OF THE POWER DYNAMICS AND SO FORTH BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'VE HAD SOME CHALLENGES- TRYING TO DRESS A CERTAIN CONDUCT RELATED TO- SOME OF THE LICENSEES CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT. AND WHAT WE NEED TO TRY TO DO TO ADDRESS THAT. YES I THINK I CAN SPEAK TO THAT AND PROBABLY THE MOST. INVOLVED IN THE ISUE- FOR THE LONGEST PERIOD OF TIME- BASICALLY WE FOUND THERE'S A CLASH OF SEXUAL BEHAVIORS THAT DID NOT FALL WITHIN SPECIFIC DEFINITIONS THAT WE USE. FOR PURPOSES OF- DISTINCT DISAPPOINTING PEOPLE FOR SEXUAL BEHAVIOR. WAS CALLED ACTUAL CONTACT HIS HOUSE TO FIND IN INVOLVED IN THE INTIMATE TOUCHING OF SPECIFIC BODY PARTS. BUT AS TIME WENT ON WE REALIZE FOR DISCIPLINARY CASES THAT- THERE WERE OTHER BEHAVIORS BEING GAUGED IN WHETHER IT'S SIXTEEN WHETHER IT IS SENDING PROVOCATIVE PICTURES TO PATIENTS OR- EXCHANGING INTIMATE NOTES WITH PATIENTS- THE I MEAN IT COULD BE A- COULD BE A WIDE VARIETY OF THINGS-FRANKLY UNDER OUR DEFINITION OF SEXUAL CONTACT. A PRACTITIONER COULD **** IN FRONT OF THEIR CLIENT EXCUSE THE EXPRESSION BUT THAT'S DIRECT TO ASIAN THEY COULD GAIN SOME TRACTION ACTUAL BEHAVIOR SOMETHING WEREN'T TOUCHING THE PATIENT WOULD NOT FALL UNDER SEXUAL CONTACT. THURMOND IN ORDER TO DISCIPLINE THEM WE WERE AT DISCIPLINING THEM UNDER ANOTHER PART OF OUR- ESTADUAL UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT IN THE USUALLY GOT DISCIPLINED AS ENCOUNTERED BY ELECTION. AND DIDN'T RESULT IN REVOCATION IN CASES WHERE REPLICATION SEEM TO BE- ESSENTIAL SO WELL WITH YOUR HELP CENTER PAN- WITH COOPERATION THE COMMITTEES. BUT WERE FASHIONING LEGISLATION PRIOR LEGISLATION- DROPPED OUT OF CONTENTION BECAUSE THE CODE THAT CRISIS BUT- WE'VE RECENTLY- FIND THE LEGISLATION A PROPOSED LEGISLATION- LAID IT TO REST OF THE WEEK SUBSUME- A FAR LARGER NUMBER OF SEXUAL BEHAVIORS WHICH WE THINK. BOTH VIOLATION OF CLIENT TRUST IN A- PLEADS- THE TRAIL OF THE PROFESSION AND THE CLIENT- SO THAT WE CAN BETTER- DISCIPLINE IN THOSE CASES AND WHERE NECESSARY ACHIEVE REPLICATION. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH I KNOW THIS IS A CHALLENGE FOR THE BOARD I KNOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT- WHAT TRUE ALL OF US WORK TOGETHER ON WE ALSO KNOW THAT COURSE THERE'S A GREATER. INCREASE OF PEOPLE NEEDING HELP FROM MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND INCLUDING CHILDREN AND WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT- WELL CERTAINLY A VAST MAJORITY OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS OF COURSE ARE YOU KNOW ACTED PROFESSIONALLY DOING THE RIGHT THING- WE ALSO WANTED SURELY PROTECTS- DOES. THAT THE- THE DOES PATIENTS FROM UNFORTUNATELY- VERY SMALL NUMBER BUT STILL- WITH THE VERY TRAUMATIC TO HAVE. THAT KIND OF AND NO RELATIONSHIP AND HAVE THE BOARD NOT BE ABLE TO TRUST THAT SO THANK. YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTERED. YES SAN ROTH. DOES A CENTIMETER FOLLOWED BY I AS A AS A JOINT EFFORT BOTH ON THE ASSEMBLY IN THE SENATE SIDE TO FOLLOW UP ON WHAT WHAT MY COLLEAGUE. FROM SACRAMENTO SAID- I'M HOPING WE TAKE A LOOK AT ALL OF THE BOARDS THAT HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PROFESSIONAL OR CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS- WITHIN THIS CASE CLIENTS AND NOT JUST THIS ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THE PRACTICE ACTS IF THAT'S WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE DEFINED UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT IN A WAY THAT. IF PROVEN TO BE THE CASE DISCIPLINE CAN BE TAKEN UP TO AND INCLUDING LICENSE REVOCATION WITHOUT HAVING THE CONCERNED SIR THAT YOU AND THE BOARD- HAVE EXPRESSED HERE SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOUR LOW END. AND MY COLLEAGUES ON BOTH IN BOTH HOUSES TO MAKE DURING THIS COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND BEYOND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SENATE ARCHULETA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I'D LIKE TO- FIRST OFFERED KNOWLEDGE ALL ALL THE THERAPISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS EVERYONE IN THE INDUSTRY FOR THE WORK THEY'VE DONE AND- AND RIGHT NOW WE ALL KNOW THE PANDEMIC IT IS GOT OUR CHILDREN UP AGAINST THE WALL WE'RE- TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GETTING THE KIDS. BACK INTO SCHOOL WHICH IS SOMETHING WE'LL BE LOOKING AT VERY QUICKLY SO CONSEQUENTLY WE FACE MENTAL ILLNESS IN THE SCHOOLS IS THERE A PARTNERSHIP- WITH YOUR INDUSTRY AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT- CAN GO TO THE SCHOOLS CAN VOLUNTEER. AND THAT MAY BE OPEN UP NEW DOORS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE AS MY COLLEAGUE- HAS STATED HAS GONE TO THE- THE RULE AREAS AREAS OF THE INNER CITY WHERE THEY CAN VOLUNTEER. IN THE SCHOOLS TO ACTUALLY AUGMENTED THE NUMBER OF PSYCHOLOGY THAT MAYBE THEY'RE IN THE SCHOOL OR THE LACK THEREOF. AND I THINK WE FIND IT IN OUR SO MANY OF OUR SCHOOLS- YOU MAY HAVE ONE NURSE FOR FIVE GRAMMAR SCHOOLS OR YOU KNOW ONLY ONE FOR- HIGH SCHOOL WITH THREE THOUSAND KIDS. BUT RIGHT NOW THAT MENTAL HEALTH IS SUCH A AN ISSUE THAT'S ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW. AND WHEN THE KIDS COME BACK THEY'RE GOING TO HIT THAT WALL IN WITHOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND- INTERVENTION. AND THERAPIST THAT CAN. YOU KNOW SPEAK TO THESE KIDS ONE ON ONE I THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE EVEN LONGER FOR THEM TO COME OUT OF THAT SHELL. VOLUNTEER PROGRAM PARTNERSHIP. THE SCHOOLS CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT PLACE. I THINK I'M PROBABLY BEST SITUATED AS A PRACTITIONER TO ADDRESS THAT QUESTION. UP OBVIOUSLY THERE'S BEEN A MAJOR MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS HEY CAN YOU FROM TALKING TO MY COLLEAGUES THAT MANY ARE EXPERIENCING EXTREME BURNOUT- THEY'VE BEEN FORCED TO TAKE A MUCH HEAVIER CASELOADS AND THEY HAD BEFORE IN SOME INSTANCES IN TRYING TO MAKE REFERRALS IN RECENT MONTHS. I'VE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND PRACTITIONERS IT COULD TAKE A REFERRAL BECAUSE THEY'RE CANCELING SO HEAVY THAT THEY COULDN'T IN GOOD CONSCIENCE TAKE ON AN EDUCATIONAL KLEINER CLIENTS- SO THERE'S A HEALTHCARE THERE'S A CRISIS TO SOME EXTENT WITHIN THE RANKS OF MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS IN TERMS OF. WHAT'S BEING REQUIRED OF US RIGHT NOW. LOOK TELL YOU HOWEVER THAT- LICENSE TECHNOLOGISTS TEND TO BE VERY PRO ACTIVE IN THEIR VOLUNTEER EFFORTS- IN TERMS OF REACHING OUT TO VARIOUS COMMUNITIES- SOME COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED. POPULATION OF PSYCHOLOGISTS IS COMING TO REPRESENTS- MORE OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE STATE AS OPPOSED TO. PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE ME- SO I THINK THERE ARE CHANGES GOING ON IN PSYCHOLOGY THAT ARE MAKING PSYCHOLOGY MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS. OF AMERICA'S COMMUNITIES. THAT BEING SAID WITHIN A SCHOOL SETTING WHICH YOU. WE WERE PERFECTLY FOCUSED ON THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE LABELED PSYCHOLOGISTS BUT THEY ARE MASTERS LEVEL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHO ARE LICENSED BY THE BOARD BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE. THERE ARE ALSO OFTEN SOMETIMES LICENSE PSYCHOLOGISTS- WITHIN THOSE FACILITIES SO I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE HAVE TO BE A REAL EMPHASIS ON. HELPING CHILDREN TO OVERCOME. THE DRAMATIZATION AND KIND OF THE- ISOLATION THAT'S BEEN CREATED. DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME SO I THINK WE'RE AS A PROFESSION PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE FULLY COGNIZANT OF THAT. BOARD IS ATTEMPTED TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE WAYS THAT WE CAN BE SUPPORTIVE BUT OBVIOUSLY WORK ON A PROVIDER OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE DIRECTLY- SO WE'VE GENERATED TAKEN VARIETY OF INITIATIVES. THAT SUPPORT WE'RE- GETTING MORE PEOPLE INTO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND TO INCREASE SUICIDE ASSESSMENT AND TRAINING- TO. DO ANYTHING ENTERED SO THE GUY HOUSE CORP- WHICH WHICH IN SOME TO SOME EXTENT INTENDED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THIS CRISIS. IN MENTAL HEALTH IN THE STATE I THINK WE'RE GONNA BE FEELING THE EFFECTS OF IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME. HELLO BY MAKE THIS YEAR- THE OTHER THING THAT WOULD TOP ISSUE HELP IS TO PROMOTE THE INDUSTRY ITSELF THE STUDY- THAT YOU ALL DO A TO GO TO THE COLLEGES TO JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS AND WORK YOUR WAY UP. TO GET THESE YOUNG PEOPLE TO GIVE BACK TO THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES BY GOING ON TO EDUCATE THEMSELVES AND MAYBE BECOME THAT LCSW THAT CAN GO INTO A SCHOOL JOINT OUTREACH PROGRAM TO PROMOTE YOUR INDUSTRY AND THE NEED OF SEX.

AND AS A REMINDER TO QUEUE UP WITH A COMMENT PRESS ONE ZERO WE'RE GOING ADELINE NUMBER THIRTY SEVEN I'M THIRTY SEVEN. HELLO MY NAME IS SHARON CHU THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY CALL. I'M CALLING IN REGARDS TO THE OVERSIGHT OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY PRACTICES AND OF THE MOTHER CHILDREN HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO THOSE PRACTICES. I WAS JUST MADE AWARE THE HEARING THIS MORNING FOR PUBLIC TRUST MY PRESENTATION IS NOT POLISHED AND I DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC DETAILED INFORMATION MY FINGER TIPS. HOWEVER I FEEL COMPELLED TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN WHO ARE SUFFERING DUE TO CERTAIN DANGEROUS MATHIS. BEING PRACTICED IN THE NAME OF PSYCHOLOGY. AND I AM WONDERING ISN'T HELPFUL OR ETHICAL TO USE TERROR KIDNAPPING FEAR AND SHOCK FACTORS AS MEANS OF CONVERSION THERAPY. MY CHILDREN WHO ARE NOW ADULTS HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO TORTUROUS ACTIONS IN THE NAME OF PSYCHOLOGY AND MANY CHILDREN HAVE BEEN AND ARE CONTINUING TO BE TORTURED BY THE SAME TECHNIQUES. SOMETIMES I UNDERSTAND IN ORDER TO HEAR WHAT DISEASE BECAUSE YOUR INITIALLY HEARD. AND THE PHYSICAL PLANTS WE THINK OF VACCINES CITING THE BROKEN BONE. IS THAT ALSO THE CASE WITH MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH. IS IT HELPFUL AND ETHICAL TO FORCE A CHILD TO FORM A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PARENT. WHO WAS ABUSING THAT CHILD. IS IT HELPS TO KICK WHICH FROM STATE SAFE AND HELP AND- IN ORDER FORCE A CHILD TO FORM A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH A PARENT WHO WAS ACCUSING THE CHILD. IS IT HELPFUL TO THREATEN A CHILD THAT DAY OR THE PARENT WITH HIM THEY FEEL SAFE. WILL BE JAILED IF THEY DO NOT FORM A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR ABUSER. FOR MY FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE I CAN RELATE TO YOU THAT THESE PRACTICES ARE NOT ONLY HARMFUL FOR THE CHILD THAT RESULT IN FURTHER BREAKDOWN OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ACCUSER AND THE CHILD. THE ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO MY OPINION AS THE SOURCE OF THE ABUSE THE REASONS THE CHILDREN AWAY FROM PARENTS. THIS IS BEEN PUSHED ASIDE AND INSTEAD THE ABUSED CHILDREN HAVE BEEN FORCED TO DENY THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ACCUSED. WHICH IN ITSELF IS AN ADDITIONAL FORM OF ABUSE. MANY COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY AND RELATIONSHIPS FAMILY BRIDGES RANDY AND YOUR TO RANDOM SIMILAR REUNIFICATION PROGRAMS. I'VE GOT. FAMILY BRIDGES CONTINUES TO HARM CHILDREN WHILE CHARGING EXORBITANT FEES. THERE ARE LITERALLY GETTING RICH BY RUNNING MONEY FROM THE TEARS OF CHILDREN I'M LEAVING THEM BROKEN AND WORN. THESE CHILDREN ARE THAT MUCH TO REPAIR THEMSELVES ADDING TO THEIR ALREADY STRANGE CONDITION. THIS REQUIRES TIME ENERGY AND FINANCES AT A TIME IN THEIR LIVES WHEN THEY SHOULD BE GOING FORWARD WITH COLLEGE CAREERS AND RELATIONSHIPS. FAMILY BRIDGES AND SIMILAR PROGRAMS NOT ONLY TERRORIZE THEM DURING THEIR CHILDHOOD. ALSO HANDICAPPED THEM DURING THEIR ADULT LIVES. PLEASE TAKE THESE COMPLAINTS SERIOUSLY FOR THE SAKE OF EACH CHILD AND FOR SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. ACCORDING TO YOUR MISSION TO PROTECT THE HEALTH SAFETY AND WELFARE OF CONSUMERS. OF PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CARE. UNLESS WILL GO TO LINE NUMBER TWENTY SEVEN YEAR OPEN GOING TO. THANK YOU THIS IS CONNIE VALENTINE FROM CALIFORNIA PROTECTIVE PARENTS ASSOCIATION AND AN ADVISER TO ADVOCATES FOR CHILD EMPOWERMENT SAFETY. WE CONTINUE TO BE GRAVELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF OVERSIGHT FOR SMALL GROUP OF PSYCHOLOGISTS. YOU DO GREAT HARM THEIR CUSTODY EVALUATORS. THE BOARD'S MISSION IS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THE PUBLIC BUT IN THESE CASES ONLY A CERTAIN SEGMENT OF THE PUBLIC IS PROTECTED. SO I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU A TYPICAL SITUATION THAT WE SEE. A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM LEAVES THE BATTERY WITH ER CHILD. THE CHILD FEEL SAFE DISCLOSING SEXUAL ABUSE BY THE FATHER AND THE MOTHER ASKED FOR PROTECTION FOR FAMILY COURT. THE COURT APPOINTED PSYCHOLOGIST UNDER EVIDENCE CODE SEVEN THIRTY AS AN EXPERT WITNESS EVEN THOUGH THE EVALUATORS NOT A CHILD SEX ABUSE EXPERT. PSYCHOLOGIST CHARGES THE PARENTS DIRECTLY THE VICTIM HAS NO FUNDS THE BATTERY PLAYS PC NORMA'S UNREGULATED FEES UP TO SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE PSYCHOLOGIST DECIDES NATURALLY THE MOTHERS TRYING TO ALIENATE THE CHILD FROM THE FATHER BECAUSE THE FATHER IS PAYMENT PSYCHOLOGIST. AND THE MOTHER IS MAKING A TIELINE. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT 72% OF THE EVALUATORS. RECOMMEND THE MOTHER DISCUSS CITY. THE JUDGE CUSTOM OF THE CHILD IS A CHILD AGENCIES MOST TO RE INJURE AND SO I KILLED. THANK YOU FOR SENATOR TO IS CREATE FAMILY CO THIRTY ONE A- FOR THESE TWO ABUSE CASES. BUT IF DID NOT FALL THE PRO. WE DEVELOPED A TEMPLATE TOOK TO THE BORDER. OF PSYCHOLOGY ENFORCEMENT OFFICER TINA BAYLISS SHE HAD IN FACT CHECKED AND SAID IT WAS CORRECT BUT THAT THE COURT HAD NO JURISDICTION HAS HAD QUITE JURISDICTION NOT THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY. SO THE LEGISLATURE STEPPED INDISCREET A NEW FORM FOR THE EVALUATORS. NOW WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE EVALUATORS WHO APPOINTED UNDER THE EVIDENCE CODE INCORRECTLY. WILL NOT USE THE FAMILY CODE FORM AND THE BOARD WILL CONTINUED NOT OVERSEEING THEM. AS WE SUGGESTED AT THE LAST SUNSET INTO A REVIEW. WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH THE BOARD THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND THE LEGISLATURE. TO ENSURE THE PROCESS WORKS PROPERLY IS SENATOR ORTIZ INTENDED IT TO PROTECT THE VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC NOT THE OFFENDERS THIS WILL NOT BE SERVED BY MORE TRAINING. THIS HOT POTATO ISSUE HAS GONE ON TOO LONG. THANK YOU FOR HELPING US. PROTECT THESE CHILDREN THAT THE PREVIOUS PERSON JUST DESCRIBED. THE PROVISIONAL COMMENTS PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND ONE MOMENT WE HAVE TWO MORE QUEUING UP. AND SEVENTY FOR YOUR OPEN GO AHEAD. I THANK YOU CHAIRMAN ROB THAT WHILE MY NAME IS KATHERINE CAMPBELL WITH THE CALIFORNIA PROTECTIVE PARENTS ASSOCIATION TODAY WE SEE THE BALLPARK STATE THAT THE AVERAGE TIME IS FIVE HUNDRED FORTY DAYS FRONT PORCH NOT YET WE KNOW ONE COMPLAINT THAT HAS YET TO GO TO THE AG'S OFFICE THAT THAT HAVE BEEN REVIEWED FOR MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS. AND WE HAVE SEEN THIS PROCESS TAKE OVER A THOUSAND DAYS ONLY TO BE DISMISSED BY A FORM LETTER EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A VALID COMPLAINT. ON PAGE FOURTEEN YOU CAN READ ABOUT THE MOST COMMON TYPE PATIENTS MOST OF THE MOST SERIOUS COMPLAINTS AFTER YEARS OF RAISING THE AWARENESS TO THIS PART OF THE CRISIS OF THE FAMILY OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE IN THE FAMILY COURT BEING DISMISSED BY INDIVIDUALS THEY AUTHORIZED. THE BOARD IS BECOME LIABLE FOR THE DISMISSAL OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE PSYCHOLOGIST OF TRAFFICKING TRAFFICKING CHILDREN IN OUR STATE. WITHOUT GIVING INDIVIDUAL BOUNDARIES BY REMOVING LICENSES WE WILL CONTINUE TO HEAR FROM PROTECTIVE PARENTS AND SEEING COURT DOCUMENTS THE SPORT LIKE TO SEE STATEMENTS SUCH AS- TO A CHILD WHO IS BEING RE PORTED- ABUSED BY THE FATHER IT IS YOUR JOB TO IMPROVE YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR FATHER HE'S YOUR FATHER. AFTER A SLAP ON THE HAND TO A NAME TO SEXUAL ABUSE ARE TELLING THE CHILD VICTIM YOU CAN WILL YOU NEED TO MOVE ON WITH YOUR NEW LIFE AND NEVER TALK ABOUT YOUR PREVIOUS LIFE AGAIN. A TECHNOLOGIST RECOMMENDING PERMANENT CUSTODY TO THE NAME SEXUAL ABUSER AFTER pABOUT THE SEXUAL ABUSE. OF REUNIFICATION CAMPSITE COLLEGES NEED TO LIVE WITH YOUR FATHER pTO LIVE WITH YOUR MOTHER AGAIN. I DID NOT KNOW HE WOULD DO THAT AFTER THAT FATHER MURDERED THE CHILD WE BELIEVE THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY HAS FALTERED WITH THEIR ENFORCEMENT AND A STAKEHOLDERS MEETING BUT THAT WAY TOO IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO NOT ADDRESS THE PROBLEM ADEQUATELY BUT JUST TRYING. TO CULTURE TO DISMISS ABUSE AND EXCUSE THE CRIMINAL AND UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR OF A LICENSING FOR THAT PERSON WORKED HARD FOR THEIR LICENSE AND IT IS THEIR PROPERTY IS A ONE EIGHTY OF WHAT THIS BOARD HAS. REPORTED GEO THAT THEY PROTECT THE PUBLIC. I'M HERE TO READ A PUB HAS NOT BEEN PUT. AND NEED IN TO. KERN NOW TO NAME A FEW AND- A CHILD. THANK YOU. WE GO NEXT TO LINE NUMBER SEVENTY THREE YEAR OPEN GOING TO. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING I'M KATHLEEN RUSSELL THE FOUNDING DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR JUDICIAL EXCELLENCE WHICH IS COMMITTED TO PROTECTING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CHILD ABUSE SURVIVORS IN OUR FAMILY COURTS AND TO FOSTERING. ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGHOUT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH FOR FIFTEEN YEARS WE'VE BEEN A VOICE FOR VULNERABLE CHILDREN AND A CATALYST FOR CHILD SAFETY WE LET THE THREE YEAR EFFORT TO SECURE THE FIRST AUDIT OF THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE AND SIXTY YEARS. NOR EQUALLY CONCERNED ABOUT PROCEDURAL PROBLEMS THAT THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY IS LICENSEES ARE CONSISTENTLY HARMING OUR STATE CHILDREN WITH IMPUNITY. I'VE ATTENDED NEARLY EVERY BOARD MEETING FOR FOUR YEARS AND I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE BOARDS I'M GOING UNDERMINING OF IT SUPPOSEDLY CORE MISSION OF PUBLIC PROTECTION LIKE THE CJP THE BOARD GIVE LIP SERVICE TO PUBLIC PROTECTION YET REPEATEDLY UNDERMINES THE PUBLIC. IT CLAIMS TO PROTECT WITH THE DISCIPLINE RATE OF TWO POINT 3% OF ALL COMPLAINTS THE BOARD IS FAILING IN ITS PRIMARY MISSION OF PROTECTING THE PUBLIC. ISSUE THREE AND THE BACKGROUND PAPER REMAINS A MAJOR BARRIER FOR THE BOARD CRUCIAL ENFORCEMENT WORK WE'VE REPEATEDLY COMPLAINED ABOUT THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND WASTE OF TIME AND RESOURCES WHEN THE PUBLIC IS EXCLUDED FROM COMMITTEE MEETINGS. THE MEDICAL BOARD'S ENFORCEMENT COMMITTEE HAS NOT PUBLICLY FOR YEARS SO THERE'S CLEAR PRECEDENT FOR MAKING ENFORCEMENT COMMITTEE A FIVE BY THE OPEN MEETING AT HERE'S A QUICK STORY TO ILLUSTRATE THE COLOSSAL WASTE OF TIME AND RESOURCES THAT THE SECRECY CREATE. FOUR YEARS AGO WE LEARNED THAT THE BOARD WAS CLOSING ALL CUSTODY COMPLAINTS IT RECEIVED WITHOUT CONSENT FORMS FROM BOTH PARENTS AND IMPOSSIBILITY AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES SINCE PERPETRATORS WHO JUST BELIEVE THEIR WAY TO WINNING CUSTODY WILL NEVER. AGREED TO CONSENT TO AN INVESTIGATION WE WERE SURE THIS CAN BE RESOLVED WITH ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENAS AND YEARS OF BOARD MEETINGS ADDRESS THIS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE BOARD DISMISSED A FOUR HUNDRED PAGE COMPLAINT BY A FORMER LAWYER WITH THE D. O. G. U. S. DOJ'S OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL THANK YOU ARE TWO MINUTES AROUND. THANK YOU.
