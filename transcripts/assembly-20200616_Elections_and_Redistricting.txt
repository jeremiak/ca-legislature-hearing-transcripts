GO AHEAD AND PRESENT YOUR BILL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO RISK THEIR HEALTH AND POSSIBLY THEIR LIFE TO EXERCISE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO VOTE I'M SURE THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN ALL AGREE ON. AND YET THAT'S THAT'S EGGS WE SAW ON APRIL SEVENTH OF THIS YEAR WHEN WISCONSINITES WERE FORCED TO ELECTION. STANDING IN LONG STANDING FOR HOURS IN LINES THAT STRETCH FOR MILES. IN THE MIDDLE OF A DEADLY HEALTH PANDEMIC AMERICAN CITIZENS YOUNG AND OLD. WERE DENIED THE ABILITY TO VOTE BY MAIL THEY WERE FORCED TO LEAVE THE SAFETY OF THEIR HOMES TO VOTE IN PERSON. DESPITE THE BEST EFFORTS OF ELECTIONS OFFICIALS. THOUSANDS OF VOTERS WHO REQUESTED ABSENTEE BALLOTS DID NOT RECEIVE THEM IN TIME TO VOTE AND RETURN THE BY ELECTION DAY. THEY WERE EFFECTIVELY DISENFRANCHISED. IN THE AFTERMATH WISCONSIN'S ELECTION. IS BECOME CLEAR. THAT THE HEALTH CONCERNS OF FORCING PEOPLE INTO IN PERSON VOTING DURING PANDEMIC FOR ALL TO READ. AN ANALYSIS BY THE WISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES FOUND AT LEAST SEVENTY ONE PEOPLE. CONTRACTED COVERT NINETEEN AFTER VOTING IN PERSON OR WORKING AT THE POLLS AT THE APRIL ELECTION. THIS IS WHY I'VE INTRODUCED AB EIGHT SIXTY WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THAT EVERY ACTIVE REGISTERED CALIFORNIA VOTERS EMAIL THE BALLOT FOR THIS NOVEMBER'S GENERAL ELECTION. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA VOTER HAS THE ABILITY TO VOTE FROM THE SAFETY OF THEIR OWN HOME. AB EIGHT SIXTY WOULD NOT ELIMINATE IMPROPER VOTING OPPORTUNITIES. CALIFORNIANS WILL NEED SAFE IN PERSON VOTING LOCATIONS THIS NOVEMBER BECAUSE THEY NEVER RECEIVED BALLOT LOST OR DAMAGED THE BALLOT. NEED LANGUAGE ERODING ASSISTANCE OR NEED TO REGISTER TO VOTE. THAT'S WHY THIS COMMITTEE WILL SOON CONSIDER AS BEFORE TWENTY THREE THE BILL I'M PROP JOINTLY- TO ENSURE THAT SEAT. THE INPUT OPTIONS AVAIL. AND ALL VOTERS HAVE LIED ABOUT PRICE IN PENDANT LIGHT. FINALLY AB EIGHT SIXTY MAKES A NUMBER OF OTHER IMPORTANT ACCOMMODATIONS TO HELP FACILITATE THE EXPECTED SURGE IN VOTING BY MAIL THAT THIS NOVEMBER'S ELECTION. IT ALLOWS COUNTIES TO BEGIN PROCESSING RETURNED VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS EARLIER SO THAT THEY CAN BETTER MANAGE THEIR WORKLOADS AND GET MORE BALLOTS COUNTED ON TONIGHT. THE END OF THE DAY AND FOUR. BONTA BALLOTS THAT THERE'S ARE NOT TO BRANCH EYES BY ANY POTENTIAL POSTAL SERVICE DELAYS. IT ALLOWS ALL VOTERS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FLEXIBILITY OFFERED BY REMOTE ACCESSIBLE VOTE BY MAIL SYSTEMS WHICH CAN BE ESPECIALLY HELPFUL. FOR OWNERS WHO NEED REPLACEMENT BALLOTS. OR WHO WANT TO RECEIVE A BALLOT IN THEIR PREFERRED LANGUAGE. FINALLY A BEAT SIXTEEN STORES THAT ALL CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRACK THEIR BALLOTS AS THEY MOVE THROUGH THE MAIL SYSTEM. AND ARE PROCESSED BY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS. AB EIGHT SIXTY SUPPORT OF ARM BY MORE THAN TWO DOZEN DIFFERENT CALIFORNIA ORGANIZATIONS. REPRESENTING DIVERSE COMMUNITIES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE CONSERVATION VOTERS.

OPPOSITION TO. NEAR IN PEOPLE BRINGING UP THE ISSUE OF AN ACTIVE VOTERS AND I KNOW YOU DID TAKE AMENDMENTS- ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE SO MAYBE I JUST GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THAT. PART OF THE OPPOSITION. THAT SURVEYS OR NOT IS IT WHAT I THINK EVERYBODY WHO WHO CALLED TO WEAR WHETHER YOU ARE A POOR WHETHER YOU OPPOSE YOU RICH WIENER. YOU KNOW IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING WHAT WE'VE ON. BECAUSE OF THE COVENANT IN PANDEMIC WE HAVE. BROUGHT IT BARKER SEE AND- PEOPLE DEBATE THE- OF THE CALL THIS. NO EXPAND IN LAW. FAVORITE YOUR HEALTH. YOUR VOICE HEARD IT YOU ABLE TO CALL IN AND HAVE YOUR VOICE. FROM THE SAFETY OF YOUR OWN HOME- AND I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL. IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD FROM THE SAFETY OF THEIR OWN HOME WALL WORK SIR CURRENTLY STRUGGLING ON A- A WORLDWIDE HEALTH PANDEMIC. MISTER VICE YOUR BRIDGES IN ON AN ACTIVE VOTERS- I'VE HAD. YET WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO PROPOSED BECAUSE- I THINK THAT THE WHOLE SENSE BY. ENACT BOATERS. LEFT TOUR OF. THEY WANT ALL TO SEND BALLOTS TO AN ACTIVE THE REAR IS THAT THE BILL DOES NOT CHANGE IN THE LAW AROUND WHAT THE STATE DOES IN TERMS OF AN ACTIVE VOTERS OF THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL IS MODELED AFTER LANGUAGE IN THE VOTERS CHOICE ACT AND IN EXISTING LAW GOVERNING MAIL BALLOT ELECTIONS AND ALL MAIL BALLOT PRECINCTS THE LANGUAGE IS NEVER BEEN INTERPRETED TO REQUIRE MAILING BALLOTS TO AN ACTIVE VOTERS FOR THE MORE. SECTION TWENTY TWO TWENTY SIX A TWO OF THE ELECTIONS CHO CLEARLY PROVIDES THAT VOTERS WITH AN INACTIVE VOTER REGISTRATION STATUS DO CIVIL ACTION MATERIALS- AND THERE ISN'T ANY CONFUSION THAT VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS ARE ELECTION MATERIALS. FINALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS POINT IS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR I AMENDED THE BILL. TO ADULT LANGUAGE SPECIFYING THAT NOTHING IN THE BILL SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO MEAN THAT A VOTER WITHIN AND VOTER. IS WORSE EVIL BY MAIL. TWENTY FOUR. STATE WHY GENERAL SO I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY WE PUT THAT. ISSUE TO BED THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR. OKAY. NOW GO TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON AB EIGHT SIXTY S. SENATE MEMBER LOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DIDN'T APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION AND THE RECOGNITION THAT DEMOCRACY RECOGNIZES THE FULL VARIETY OF OPINION AND YET THAT IS. OF ILLUSTRATIVE OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY TO ENSURE THAT IT WHEN FORCES IS HEARD ESPECIALLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND HOW DO WE FUNCTION AND ALLOW FOR THOSE VOICES TO BE RECOGNIZED IN HER. AND DO YOU HAVE DEMONSTRATED- AND CONSISTENT WITH THE CONVERSATION THAT YOU KNOW I'VE HAD BUT ALSO IN THIS COMMITTEE TO HELP ENCOURAGE AND TO INCREASE ACCESS VERSUS THAT OF LOWERING BARRIERS AND IN FACT IT IT IS ALSO POINT TO KNOW THAT YOU UNDERSTAND INTRODUCED THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION BACK IN APRIL. TWO WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY THE GOVERNOR ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER AND THIS HELPS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT AT IT BECAUSE HAVE DEBATE HAVE CONVERSATION AND THAT THERE IS- A FULL ANALYSIS OF THE PROS AND CONS SO SHOULD THAT TOO BUT I THANK YOU FOR CLEAR VOICE ON THIS TOO BECAUSE I KNOW THERE WAS TING TO. AND CAN EXPECT NUMBER EXECUTIVE. AND WHAT ABOUT THE AUTUMN MUST CONST NOW FOR THE LAW TERM BUT AGAIN- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR DOING SO AND WITH THAT ALSO- MAKE A MOTION IN SUPPORT. I HAD MOVED TO A MEMBER LOW AND SECONDED BY ASSUME RECALLED ROOM. OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS YES IS A MEMBER MASON I JUST ALSO WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR BRINGING THIS. FORWARD THERE HAS BEEN- CONVERSATION OF THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS AS WE'VE BEEN BACK IN SESSION ONE IN REGARDS TO- THE- ADMINISTRATION AND HIS USE OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS- I'VE BEEN A CRITICAL- OF THE- THE FEDERAL CHIEF EXECUTIVE. AND THE NUMBER OF EX EXACT- IS THAT HE IS ISSUED- I'VE ALSO BEEN CRITICAL OF THE OF THE ORDERS ARE GOVERNOR. I'M HAS PUT IN MOTION I- THEM SOMEBODY THAT BELIEVES THAT WE MUST LIKE THE LA SAID MY GEL. GUARD CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE IN THIS LOCKER SEE. THE LEAD I AM A GOING TO SUPPORT THIS SUPPORT THIS TODAY I'M A STRONG PROPONENT OF THE VOTE BY MAIL I THINK IN FACT I'VE BEEN DOING IT BUT VIRTUALLY MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE I DON'T KNOW WHY OR THE LAST- A EW MONTHS- ALL OF A SUDDEN IS THERE'S THIS QUESTION THAT'S BEEN POPPING UP ABOUT WHETHER. IT'S FRAUDULENT I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT PEOPLE WHO VOTE BY MAIL OR THE ONES THAT ARE SAYING THAT IT'S IT IT'S FRAUDULENT SO I'M I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED CONCERNED ABOUT JUST THE MESSAGE IN THE RHETORIC OF THAT IS HAS GOTTEN OUT THERE I DO. ACTIONS ARE OUR SOUND- ARE THERE OF ONE OFFS HERE THERE TOWARD THE BAR I'M WE HAVE A FANTASTIC THE PROGRAM- NOT JUST IN THE STATE BUT IN THIS THIS COUNTRY AND TO THE VOTERS OF THE STATE CAN CAN NO OF THAT I WENT UP WHEN THE WHEN THE POLLS ARE COUNTY WITH ABOUT COUNTED AT THE DATE THE- THERE IS A OUR FOUND. QUESTIONS. OKAY THE SO MISTER CHAIRMAN I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BO. TAKING ON THIS ISSUE BUT ALSO REALLY TRYING TO LISTEN AND GET ALL THE INPUT- YOU KNOW AS WAS MENTIONED- NO WE DID HAVE THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER YOU KNOW YOUR- LEGISLATION I THINK TAKES INTO ACCOUNT MANY OTHER THINGS THAT THAT NEEDED TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT- FOR INSTANCE I KNOW. YOU KNOW IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER SAID EVERYONE WOULD HAVE TO USE THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S TRACKING SYSTEM. YOUR LEGISLATION MAKES CLEAR BECAUSE SOME COUNTIES HAVE THEIR OWN TRACKING SYSTEMS. ALLOWS THOSE COUNTIES TO USE THOSE OF THEIR- YOU KNOW IN THE BACK OF A BETTER QUALITY- THAN THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S- TRACKING SYSTEM- YOU ALSO DID DEAL WITH THE ENACTED VOTER ISSUE WHICH I KNOW THAT. WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS A CONCERN THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE INACTIVE WOULD NOT BE GETTING- BALLOTS- SO. I DO APPRECIATE THE COOPER AND ARE YOU APPROACH THIS. I ALSO AGREE I THINK THAT. THE MALE BOWING OUT MAIL IN BALLOT- ELECTIONS ARE SECURE- AND ESPECIALLY WHEN- IN THE IDEAL CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE SOMEONE IS. TURNING THEIR MAIL ABOUT THEY FILL THAT OUT THEY PUT A MALE THAT AS A SECURE. WAY OF LOGGING. A BOAT. WHERE THEY SIR INCOMES IT MORE THAT. QUESTION IS REALLY A THE ISSUE OF. A BALLOT HARVESTING- IF YOU WILL AND THAT PEOPLE MIGHT BE GETTING BALLOTS THAT. YES SOMEONE TAKING FROM SOMEONE HEY JUST SIGNED ABOUT AND I'LL FILL IT OUT FOR YOU THOSE ARE THINGS HARD TO PROVE. OTHER THINGS THEY'RE REALLY HARD TO FIND- BUT- YOU KNOW THERE'S CERTAINLY BEEN A LOT OF CONCERNS THAT THAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING- AND ALSO IN A COVERT NINETEEN WORLD. ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS BEEN THE HALF OF IT YOU KNOW WE'VE ALLOWED FOR ABOUT HARVESTING OF LOT FOR PEOPLE TO GO DOOR TO DOOR LITERALLY. GETTING BALLOTS IS THAT REALLY THE BEST PRACTICE IN THIS NOVEMBER ELECTION. TO ALLOW THAT TO CONTINUE. I PERSONALLY THINK THAT WE SHOULD. SCALE THAT BACK CONSIDERING THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE AND ALL THIS IS REALLY FOCUSED ON THE NOVEMBER ELECTION AND SOCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. THAT WE FIND OURSELVES AND SO THAT THAT THAT IS ONE CONCERN AYE. AS WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE. AND THEN AS AS WE'VE DISCUSSED I CERTAINLY WANT ANYBODY WHO IS WHO HAS MADE A VOTE IN TURN IN A BALLOT- HONOR BEFORE ELECTION DAY FOR THAT BOTH TO BE COUNTED. YOU DID IN YOUR LEGISLATION PROVIDE FOR A WAY TO AUTHENTICATE BALLOTS THAT COME AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE POSTMARK. FOR INSTANCE THAT'S ONE WAY TO AUTHENTICATE- BUT WERE ALLOWING UP TO SEVENTEEN DAYS FOR ABOUT TO COME IN AND SOME OF THOSE DOUBTS MIGHT NOT HAVE A POSTMARK. YOU KNOW THERE IS SOME QUESTION ABOUT OKAY ARE THOSE COULD THOSE POTENTIALLY BE BALLOTS THAT ARE TURNED AND MAYBE THEY'RE FOUND AFTER THE ELECTION AND TURNED IN. SOMEWHERE THERE IS TURN ABOUT ISSUES THERE AND SO- YOU KNOW. THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT I THINK WE- I THINK WE CAN DO THIS THIS DOES HELP PROVIDE FOR A SAY PROCESS BUT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT I. THAT I KIND OF STILL HAVE BEEN MAYBE I'LL JUST GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO JUST ADDRESS. THOSE ISSUES. AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR. WHAT I THINK. YOU HAVE DONE IN TERMS OF TAKING THIS ISSUE ON AND REALLY GETTING. A LOT OF THE INPUT TO MAKE SURE THIS IS BOTH A SAFE. AND THAT WE ENSURE THAT THERE'S PROPER PROTECTIONS. OF THE VOTE BUT I'LL JUST GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. SURE APPRECIATE THE MOST PRESSURE ALSO APPRECIATE THE MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU AND I HAVE HAD IT YOU KNOW JUST ABOUT THESE ISSUES. YOU KNOW GIVEN THAT WE'RE ASKING PEOPLE TO STAY HOME TO AVOID THE SPREAD OF THE CROWN OF OURS I THINK THE LAST THING. THAT WOULD WANT TO DO IS TO TELL A VOTER THAT THEY CAN'T ASK SOMEONE THAT THEY TRUST. TO RETURN THERE. I AND INSTEAD FORCE THE VOTER LEAVE HOME TO. THEIR BALLOT IF ONE VOTE IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION. AND WHILE MANY VOTERS HAVE THE OPTION ON THE BACK ON NOT. VOTERS HAVE HOME MAIL. OF FOR THE MORE PUTTING ABOUT IT IN THE MAILBOX. ELECTION DAY RISKS THE BALLOT NOT BEING COUNTED IF THE MAILBOXES ARE. IT'S LAST OF THE DAY. AND I JUST WANT TO. YOU KNOW YOU YOU. TO SOMEBODY GIVING THEIR BALLOT TO SIGN A BALLOT GIVING IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE TO FILL OUT THAT'S A- ON THE- THAT IS. GOING CAL OF. NOT THAT ARE THE HAVE SEVEN ON A DID HAVE IT SURE WE HAVE NO HAVE THAT IT IS HOW BUT BUT YOU KNOW THAT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT IF IT DOES HAPPEN IS ALREADY VERY VERY ILLEGAL- AND IT IS A FELONY. THERE WAS A FELLA THERE'S ONE OTHER ISSUE THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT I WANTED TO ADDRESS- BUT YEAH THE ISSUE OF ALLOWING DOLLAR RIDE UP TO SEVENTEEN DAYS AFTER THE ELECTION TO BE COUNTED. NOT WITH SOME OF THOSE BROUGHT TO US BY. A SUPPORTED AT LEAST BY. YEAH CAL. SO OF CLERKS AND ALLOW. IF EXPRESSLY ADVOCATED FOR THIS. OR A SIMILAR PROVISION- THEMSELVES AT THE CONCLUSION OF WORKING GROUP DISCUSSIONS THAT. THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAD CONVENE- AND IT'S REALLY JUST AN INSURANCE BACKSTOPS. BECAUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF JUNE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SITUATION IS GOING TO BE LIKE. IN NOVEMBER AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT. INTERNATIONAL ALL IS GONNA BE LIKE SO I THINK IN THE BILL THERE'S ENOUGH PROTECTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT IF A BALLOT DOES HAPPEN TO ARRIVE- YOU KNOW FOURTEEN DAYS FIFTEEN DAYS SIXTY DAYS SEVENTEEN DAYS AFTER THE ELECTION. STRONG SECURITY MAKING SURE IT. THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE FAULT OF THE POSTAL SERVICE OR SOMETHING IN THE MAIL STREAM IT'S NOT THE FULL OF THE VOTER. AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE VOTERS VOICES HER- SO THAT'S ALL THAT'S TRYING TO ADDRESS AND AGAIN IT YOU KNOW IF I VOTER WORK TO LINE- AND- ON THE BALLOT. OR ON THEIR OWN THE BILL BY MAIL ENVELOPE. THAT IS DIFFERENT THAT'S A FELONY- AND WE HAVE STRONG LEGAL PROTECTIONS IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW IF THOSE PEOPLE- ARE FOUND TO HAVE LIED AND POST DATED THEIR THEIR BALLOTS. THEY'LL THEY'LL BE PROSECUTED FOR THAT SO. I THINK THE- I WOULD WOULD TRY TO STRIKE- I KIND OF YOU KNOW MIDDLE ROAD IN TERMS OF. ALLOWING THESE PROTECTIONS JUST TO TRY TO ANTICIPATE. ALL THE THINGS THAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN NOVEMBER- YEAH THAT THE KIND OF WORST CASE SCENARIOS. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROTECT VOTER CALIFORNIA AND THEIR ABILITY TO VOTE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- ANYTHING FURTHER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE- IS THAT YEAH I THINK THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT- REALLY APPRECIATE ALL CONVERSATIONS FOLKS HAVE HAD- AND RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. HOLD THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND I AND AS THAT LAST PART AND THE CHECKS THAT YOU DID PUT INTO THIS BILL. ON THAT I AM GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY- BASED ON THIS BEING A- YOU KNOW FOCUSED ON THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE HAVE IN THIS NOVEMBER ELECTION. AND THE OTHER CHECKS AND THAT YOU'VE PUT INTO THIS BILL I THINK IT IT MAKES THAT RIGHT BALLOT SO THERE WILL BE A POINT TODAY AND- MR CLERK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO RETURN THE BILL TO THE FLOOR WITH THE RECOMMENDATION THAT SENATE AMENDMENTS BE CONCURRED IN BERMAN HI BERMAN I GALLAGHER AYE. GALLAGHER AYE CALDERON. ALL THEIR OWN I LOW. LOW I MAYES MAYES AYE MULLIN MULLIN I WEBER. AND IT'S SIX ZERO. OKAY THAT SIX ZERO AND THAT BILLS OUT THING ON A REGULAR LEAVE THE- TO HAVE OTHERS COMING THAT HONOR NOT SURE OF DOCTOR OVER MISSION SHOULD SHE MEANT UP TO GET BY ELEVEN FOR FIVE SO MAYBE WE'LL GIVE IT AND IT'S FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR HER TO COME% DOWN AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT THEN YEAH WELL I'M FINE FINE TO DO THAT. LEAVE IT OPEN- AND FOR OTHERS DATA. BEFORE WE ADJOURN. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BRIDGET. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. BUT DIFFICULT. BACK HERE WITH- THEY CAN COME BACK HERE WITH YOU I'M GONNA TRY TO CHECK WITH YOU CAN AND SEE IF YOU CAN HEAR. UP WITH OUR OFFICE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE GOING BACK. FOR THE. WORKING AROUND THE- BASED ON THE ONE. WELL MAYBE NOT NORMAN MAYBE ANOTHER. HELLO THAT.
