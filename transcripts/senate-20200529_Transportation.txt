MY NAME IS TELL ME DEAL I AM THE MAYOR PRO TEM OF THE CITY OF RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA AND A MEMBER OF THE TRANSPORTATION CORRIDOR AGENCY BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE CITY OF RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA STRONGLY OPPOSES THIS BILL. ALSO IT IS FALSE CLAIM THAT THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION CODIFIES PRIOR ACTION TAKEN BY THE TRANSPORTATION CORRIDOR AGENCY. THE P. C. EIGHTY HAS NEVER TAKEN THAT ACTION. IT IS ALSO FALSE TO SUGGEST THAT THIS LEGISLATION WOULD STOP CONTROVERSY. THE EXACT OPPOSITE IS TRUE THIS LEGISLATION WOULD BE OPPOSED BY MANY CITIES INCLUDING THE CITY OF RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA AS WELL AS MISSION BE A HELPFUL AND OTHERS. ALSO THIS IS THE LOCAL ISSUE THAT IS HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL IT IS NOT A STATE ISSUE. AND SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO RESOLVE. ESPECIALLY DURING THIS VERY DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING TIME WITH COLLUDED NINETEEN. THE STATE LEGISLATURE HAS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO THAN TO GET INVOLVED IN.
