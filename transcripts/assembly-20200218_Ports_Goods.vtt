THESE. TOPICS THERE ARE A LOT

00:33:01.946 --> 00:33:03.314
OF OTHER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THAT

CAN START OFF A HEARING TALK

00:33:04.215 --> 00:33:05.283
ABOUT HOW THEY'RE VISITING

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.688
HEARD TO REPEAT THE SAME PORT.

00:33:10.755 --> 00:33:12.290

WITH MAKE OUR SEAPORTS WORK THE

00:33:18.096 --> 00:33:20.064
PROJECT THAT- WE DO WANT TO

00:33:20.131 --> 00:33:21.699
ADDRESS OUR QUICKLY AND I HAVE

00:33:21.766 --> 00:33:23.568
A COUPLE SLIDES AND SPEAK-

00:33:23.634 --> 00:33:25.203
RELATIVELY QUICKLY GO THROUGH.

00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.937
SOME OF OUR THINGS ARE GONNA BE

00:33:26.003 --> 00:33:27.305
FAMILIAR WITH- SOME OF THE

00:33:27.372 --> 00:33:29.474
NUMBERS ARE A LITTLE BIT NEW.

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:32.643
THESE ARE OLD- SO THE CONTEXT

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:34.345
FOR WHERE WE ARE NOW OBVIOUSLY

00:33:34.412 --> 00:33:35.880
IS THE HISTORY OF OUR GROWTH

00:33:35.947 --> 00:33:39.217
AND WHAT IT MEANS. SO FROM

00:33:39.283 --> 00:33:39.851
NINETEEN NINETY TO TWO THOUSAND

00:33:39.917 --> 00:33:43.020
SIX. LA LONG BEACH OAKLAND ALL-

00:33:43.087 --> 00:33:45.056
HAD VERY VERY ROBUST AND

00:33:45.123 --> 00:33:48.359
PROFOUND CONTINUOUS GROW PATHS.

00:33:48.426 --> 00:33:50.328
AND WHEN YOU WERE TO THOUSAND

00:33:50.395 --> 00:33:51.829
SIX REGULATOR POLICY GIRL

00:33:51.896 --> 00:33:53.664
UNDERWRITER OR REPORT I'M DOING

00:33:53.731 --> 00:33:56.634
TRANSPORTATION PLANNING- YOU

00:33:56.701 --> 00:33:57.902
PROJECTED OUT NUMBERS THAT LOOK

00:33:57.969 --> 00:33:59.337
LIKE THIS THESE ARE FROM THE-

00:33:59.404 --> 00:34:01.038
CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD

00:34:01.105 --> 00:34:04.909
SICA'S MOVING MISSION REDUCTION

00:34:04.976 --> 00:34:06.611
PLAN TWO THOUSAND SIX LOOKING

00:34:06.677 --> 00:34:08.513
AT CLOSE TO. A PER. OF THE WELL.

00:34:08.579 --> 00:34:09.680
A LOT MORE CONTAINERS THAN WE

00:34:09.747 --> 00:34:11.182
ACTUALLY MOVED SO WHAT ACTUALLY

00:34:11.249 --> 00:34:13.418
HAPPENED BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND

00:34:13.484 --> 00:34:15.353
SIX AND- TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:16.888
LAST YEAR'S NUMBERS. WERE LA

00:34:16.954 --> 00:34:19.357
LONG BEACH OAKLAND. ALL AROUND

00:34:19.424 --> 00:34:21.259
50% BELOW WHERE WE PROJECT OUR

00:34:21.325 --> 00:34:23.995
TOTAL THROUGHPUT. OF REPRESENTS

00:34:24.061 --> 00:34:25.530
ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION

00:34:25.596 --> 00:34:27.198
CONTAINERS THAT WE DID NOT OF.

00:34:27.265 --> 00:34:30.067
THREE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- AND

00:34:30.134 --> 00:34:32.804
THAT'S REFLECTION OF. NOT JUST

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:34.505
THE SLOWER GLOBAL ECONOMY AND

00:34:34.572 --> 00:34:35.473
TRADE BECAUSE IT DID SLOW DOWN

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:36.774
A LITTLE BIT BUT IT'S PRIMARILY

00:34:36.841 --> 00:34:38.443
REFLECTION OF THE FACT THAT-

00:34:38.509 --> 00:34:41.679
WE'RE LOSING MARKET SHARE. AND

00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:44.348
A MACRO LEVEL WYRLEY LOSING

00:34:44.415 --> 00:34:46.684
MARKET SHARE. THIS I THINK

00:34:46.751 --> 00:34:48.486
PARAPHRASES- WHAT THE GOVERNOR

00:34:48.553 --> 00:34:52.890
TOLD CAMP. WE NEED TO BE

00:34:52.957 --> 00:34:53.458
REINVESTING IN OUR OUR

00:34:53.524 --> 00:34:55.793
INFRASTRUCTURE- BUT WHAT

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.962
HAPPENS IS WHEN WE LOSE VOLUME

00:34:58.029 --> 00:34:59.530
AT THE SAME TIME WE INCREASE

00:34:59.597 --> 00:35:00.498
COSTS WHICH IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN

00:35:00.565 --> 00:35:03.701
DOING- YOUR COST PER BOX

00:35:03.768 --> 00:35:05.169
OBVIOUSLY GOES UP RELATIVE TO

00:35:05.236 --> 00:35:07.238
YOUR COMPETITION- AND WHAT

00:35:07.305 --> 00:35:08.639
HAPPENS THEN YOUR

00:35:08.706 --> 00:35:10.174
COMPETITIVENESS DECREASES YOUR

00:35:10.241 --> 00:35:12.844
VOLUMES GO DOWN WHEN YOU'RE

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:14.111
VOLUMES GO DOWN. COST PER BOX

00:35:14.178 --> 00:35:15.813
GOES UP IT'S THE SORT OF THE

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.215
VIRTUOUS CYCLE REINVESTMENT

00:35:17.281 --> 00:35:19.016
THAT WE ALL WANT. WE ALL WANT

00:35:19.083 --> 00:35:20.852
MORE CONTAINERS WHICH MAKE

00:35:20.918 --> 00:35:21.953
ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN

00:35:22.019 --> 00:35:23.654
INFRASTRUCTURE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:26.123
UPGRADES CHEAPER PER UNIT. AND

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:26.924
WE'VE BEEN MAKING THE MORE

00:35:26.991 --> 00:35:28.960
EXPENSIVE PER UNIT. SO AS A

00:35:29.026 --> 00:35:30.328
RESULT OF ALL OF THAT IF YOU

00:35:30.394 --> 00:35:32.063
LOOK AT THAT THAT CHART THIS

00:35:32.129 --> 00:35:34.866
AGAIN FROM NINETEEN NINETY TO

00:35:34.932 --> 00:35:35.366
TWO THOUSAND SIX WE WERE

00:35:35.433 --> 00:35:37.768
STEADILY GAINING NOT JUST TOTAL

00:35:37.835 --> 00:35:39.170
THROUGHPUT BUT ALSO MARKET

00:35:39.237 --> 00:35:39.737
SHARE THIS IS A MARKET SHARE

00:35:39.804 --> 00:35:42.406
COMPARISON- FOR TOTALLY WEST

00:35:42.473 --> 00:35:44.242
CONTAINERS ON THE TOP IN TOTAL

00:35:44.308 --> 00:35:45.243
NORTH AMERICAN. PAINTERS ON THE

00:35:45.309 --> 00:35:49.080
BOTTOM- POST DOESN'T SIT GIVEN

00:35:49.146 --> 00:35:51.883
MOST OF IT BACK SO WE ARE NOT.

00:35:51.949 --> 00:35:53.451
MOVING AS MUCH AS OTHER PORTS

00:35:53.518 --> 00:35:54.352
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT WILL

00:35:54.418 --> 00:35:55.319
BREAK IT DOWN THAT THE GREEN

00:35:55.386 --> 00:35:57.121
LINES AT THE BOTTOM ARE. SAN

00:35:57.188 --> 00:35:59.257
PEDRO BAY IN OAKLAND- OUR

00:35:59.323 --> 00:36:01.225
COMPETITORS SAVANNAH OTHER AT

00:36:01.292 --> 00:36:03.594
CANADIAN WEST COAST PORTS-

00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:05.963
VIRGINIA NEW YORK NEW JERSEY

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:08.466
THERE ARE GROWING MUCH FASTER.

00:36:08.533 --> 00:36:09.967
AND SO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK

00:36:10.034 --> 00:36:12.370
AT THAT ON A ON A COASTAL BASIS

00:36:12.436 --> 00:36:14.272
THIS IS- WE TOOK THIS FROM-

00:36:14.338 --> 00:36:17.241
PRESENTATION- I JUST MARKET

00:36:17.308 --> 00:36:20.611
SHARE. I'M SORRY I AM AT MY AGE

00:36:20.678 --> 00:36:22.680
AS MARKET COMPARISON MARKET

00:36:22.747 --> 00:36:25.049
SHARE- AND YOU CAN SEE THE US

00:36:25.116 --> 00:36:27.084
WEST COAST COAST MARKET SHARE

00:36:27.151 --> 00:36:29.320
THAT GREEN BAR GOING DOWN.

00:36:29.387 --> 00:36:30.621
SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND

00:36:30.688 --> 00:36:33.357
WE'RE LOSING- OVERALL MARKET

00:36:33.424 --> 00:36:34.892
SHARE TO EAST COAST IN A LITTLE

00:36:34.959 --> 00:36:40.531
BIT TO THE GULF COAST- SO.

00:36:40.598 --> 00:36:41.165
MOVING FORWARD WHEN WE'RE DOING

00:36:41.232 --> 00:36:43.167
PLANNING POLICY NOW THIS WAS

00:36:43.234 --> 00:36:44.702
TAKEN FROM A DRAFT SEAPORT ANY

00:36:44.769 --> 00:36:47.572
EXERCISE AT THE CDC THE BACON

00:36:47.638 --> 00:36:48.139
PROVISION BELLMAN COMMISSION

00:36:48.205 --> 00:36:50.308
THERE. LOOKING AT- FLOWS FOR

00:36:50.374 --> 00:36:52.343
PLANNING WHAT HAPPENS ON THE

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:54.312
BAY AREA IN TERMS OF INVESTMENT

00:36:54.378 --> 00:36:56.380
AND NEW SEAPORT INFRASTRUCTURE-

00:36:56.447 --> 00:36:58.282
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT OUR OUR

00:36:58.349 --> 00:37:00.484
TOTAL COASTAL SHARES OF LOADED

00:37:00.551 --> 00:37:04.155
IMPORTS ON PACIFIC WEST THIS IS

00:37:04.221 --> 00:37:09.527
NOW BELOW 50% UP AND ALONG FOR

00:37:09.594 --> 00:37:12.196
A- YOU KNOW. FIFTH SEVEN FIFTY

00:37:12.263 --> 00:37:15.700
EIGHT PER SO THAT'S DRAMATIC

00:37:15.766 --> 00:37:17.802
AND THEN. I THINK TO THAT THE

00:37:17.868 --> 00:37:19.337
POINT OF A MADE BY BOTH AND

00:37:19.403 --> 00:37:21.439
THAT YOU'RE UP OR- THERE'S A

00:37:21.505 --> 00:37:23.274
COST TO LIEU. A SHARE THE

00:37:23.341 --> 00:37:24.241
OBVIOUSLY THEIR COSTS THE

00:37:24.308 --> 00:37:26.377
KEEPING MARKET SHARE WE- REALLY

00:37:26.444 --> 00:37:27.612
DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT

00:37:27.678 --> 00:37:28.045
THERE ARE NEGATIVE

00:37:28.112 --> 00:37:29.747
EXTERNALITIES WITH WHAT WE DO

00:37:29.814 --> 00:37:31.148
AND WE'RE SPENDING A LOT OF

00:37:31.215 --> 00:37:33.050
MONEY AND TIME AND ENERGY. TO

00:37:33.117 --> 00:37:35.052
ADDRESS THOSE THINGS- A HER

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:36.821
FROM KRISTIN BECAUSE THE TOTAL

00:37:36.887 --> 00:37:38.856
OVERALL EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS WE

00:37:38.923 --> 00:37:40.391
THINK ARE ARE. SOMETHING THAT

00:37:40.458 --> 00:37:41.959
WE'RE VERY PROUD OF. THEIR

00:37:42.026 --> 00:37:44.462
SIGNIFICANT- WE'RE ALSO REALLY

00:37:44.528 --> 00:37:46.697
PROUD OF THE JOB KNOCKED

00:37:46.764 --> 00:37:47.331
BENEFITS THE COME WITH WHAT WE

00:37:47.398 --> 00:37:50.401
DO. SO IN LA EVERY FOR

00:37:50.468 --> 00:37:52.436
CONTAINERS TO COME THROUGH

00:37:52.503 --> 00:37:54.839
THAT'S A JOB. A TWO AND A FIFTY

00:37:54.905 --> 00:37:55.439
DOLLAR PER CONTAINER STAY LOW

00:37:55.506 --> 00:37:57.408
TAX. THAT IS REAL BENEFIT TO

00:37:57.475 --> 00:37:59.644
THE STATE. NOT TO MENTION THE

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:01.045
INDIRECT BENEFITS OF ACTUALLY

00:38:01.112 --> 00:38:02.980
ALL OF THE PERSONAL INCOME THAT

00:38:03.047 --> 00:38:03.681
COMES FOR CONTAINER AND IN

00:38:03.748 --> 00:38:06.450
OAKLAND IT'S THREE JOHN- EVERY

00:38:06.517 --> 00:38:09.253
THREE CONTAINERS YOU SEE JOHN.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.722
AND SO WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT

00:38:11.789 --> 00:38:14.392
AND WHY AS A MATTER- WELL IT IF

00:38:14.458 --> 00:38:15.893
WE'RE NOT COMPETITIVE WE'RE

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.294
GONNA GROW SLOWER THAN WE NEED

00:38:17.361 --> 00:38:19.163
TO. AND WE WILL BE MISSING OUT

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.264
ON ALL THESE BENEFITS WILL BE

00:38:20.331 --> 00:38:21.999
MISSING OUT ON STATE IN TAX

00:38:22.066 --> 00:38:23.834
REVENUES- WILL BE MISSING OUT

00:38:23.901 --> 00:38:25.069
ON JOBS TO BE MISSING A

00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:27.071
PERSONAL INCOME. SO THESE WERE

00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:28.806
THE LAST COUPLE OF FORECAST

00:38:28.873 --> 00:38:32.209
FROM- 200-072-0009 THAT WERE

00:38:32.276 --> 00:38:35.980
DONE- IN LA LONG BEACH- AND

00:38:36.047 --> 00:38:36.547
THEN WE'RE LOOKING AT A NEW

00:38:36.614 --> 00:38:38.649
FORECAST IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. YOU

00:38:38.716 --> 00:38:40.818
CAN SEE WHERE WE'RE TRACKING-

00:38:40.885 --> 00:38:42.853
WE MISSED OUR OUR TWO THOUSAND

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.489
SEVEN FORECASTS WERE MISSING OR

00:38:45.556 --> 00:38:46.057
TWO THOUSAND NINE FOUR CATS

00:38:46.123 --> 00:38:47.558
WERE TRACKING OUR LOW FOR US.

00:38:47.625 --> 00:38:48.926
FOR TOTAL TO EAT SINCE PETER

00:38:48.993 --> 00:38:52.096
BACK THAT'S CONCERNING TO US.

00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:56.267
THE SAME- TRENDS ARE ARE

00:38:56.333 --> 00:38:58.035
PROJECTED FOR PORT OF OAKLAND

00:38:58.102 --> 00:38:59.837
YOU CAN START ON WOULD BE.

00:38:59.904 --> 00:39:02.973
FANTASTIC IF WE COULD MOVE

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:06.977
SEVEN MILLION TEAS WITH VOCAL

00:39:07.044 --> 00:39:12.116
ABOUT MAYES. WELL MICHAEL

00:39:12.183 --> 00:39:13.150
ADELINE IT'S GOING TO FIVE

00:39:13.217 --> 00:39:14.518
MILLION T. THROUGH TWENTY WHICH

00:39:14.585 --> 00:39:16.320
IS A DOT OF TOLL THROUGHPUT

00:39:16.387 --> 00:39:17.455
RIGHT NOW ARE ABOUT POINT FIVE

00:39:17.521 --> 00:39:18.489
BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE TRYING TO

00:39:18.556 --> 00:39:20.257
DOWN TOWARDS OUT LINE WHICH

00:39:20.324 --> 00:39:23.194
DOES NOT EVEN GETS TO THE PLACE

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:24.462
WHERE OUR MEMBERS HAVE ALREADY

00:39:24.528 --> 00:39:28.899
THEN COSTS AND PLEASE. THAT

00:39:28.966 --> 00:39:31.402

PART OF. ALBANY JOHN RICHMOND

00:40:08.606 --> 00:40:10.174
AND OBVIOUSLY THE FLOWS ARE

00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:12.009
VERY SIMILAR AND PART OF SAN

00:40:12.076 --> 00:40:15.913

AT IS A RELATIVELY SMALL.

00:40:42.807 --> 00:40:44.875
PERCENTAGE OF GROWTH OVER TIME-

00:40:44.942 --> 00:40:47.378
IF YOU ARE NOT IN A MODERATE OR

00:40:47.444 --> 00:40:49.947
HIGH GROWTH ENVIRONMENT- THESE

HAPPY ACRE. ON CERTAIN ASPECTS

00:53:31.207 --> 00:53:32.742
OF OUR POLICIES. SUCH AS-

00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:34.578
GETTING UTILITY INVESTMENT IN.

00:53:34.644 --> 00:53:35.912
CHARGING STRUCTURE. OFFER

TRANSPORTATION. AND HOWEVER

00:53:38.315 --> 00:53:40.350
MOST OTHER STATES ARE TAKING

00:53:40.417 --> 00:53:42.953
MORE OF A- YOU KNOW THE- CARE.

00:53:43.019 --> 00:53:45.488
THE STATE PRO. WITH ITS INDUCED.

00:53:45.555 --> 00:53:46.623

SICK IS. VERY RAPIDLY. CHAIN

00:53:50.093 --> 00:53:51.928
MORE. BUT THESE AREAS YOU KNOW

00:53:51.995 --> 00:53:53.897
AND I. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:53:53.964 --> 00:53:55.732
THAT WOULD BENEFIT- THE SYSTEM

00:53:55.799 --> 00:53:58.001
AS A WHOLE IS KEEPING IN- IN

00:53:58.068 --> 00:54:00.370
AYE TOWARDS THE PLACES WHERE

00:54:00.437 --> 00:54:02.339
THIS TECHNOLOGY WITH WHAT IT

00:54:02.405 --> 00:54:04.240
CAN DO TODAY. AND WHAT ARE THE

00:54:04.307 --> 00:54:05.542
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ELECTRIC

00:54:05.609 --> 00:54:07.410
CHARGING AND JUST GOING UP TO A

00:54:07.477 --> 00:54:10.146
FUELINGSTATION TO GET A TAKE A

00:54:10.213 --> 00:54:11.781
DIESEL- MEAN AND IF WE CAN

00:54:11.848 --> 00:54:14.184
CONCENTRATE TIME AND EFFORTS IN

00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:15.452
MAKING SURE THAT THE TECHNOLOGY

00:54:15.518 --> 00:54:19.389
WORKS- WORKS TO DEAD. RECIPE

00:54:19.456 --> 00:54:20.390
FOR SUCCESS AND NOT CHIU

00:54:20.457 --> 00:54:22.492
HORNADY AND IN- THE STREET IT'S

00:54:22.559 --> 00:54:25.228

IT IS. SAID AND YOU. YOU WILL

00:54:30.133 --> 00:54:31.301
MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T CREATE

00:54:31.368 --> 00:54:32.135
GREEN POVERTY HERE IN

00:54:32.202 --> 00:54:34.037
CALIFORNIA MY REGULATING THESE

00:54:34.104 --> 00:54:35.872
INDUSTRIES OUT. AND THEY HAVE

00:54:35.939 --> 00:54:37.240

00:54:37.307 --> 00:54:38.341
ALL THE JOBS MIGHT BE THERE AND

00:54:38.408 --> 00:54:39.909
I THINK YOU. YOU YOU LET ARE

00:54:39.976 --> 00:54:41.645
TRIED IS BEING SAMPLE OF

00:54:41.711 --> 00:54:42.812
SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPENING

00:54:42.879 --> 00:54:44.347

TRAINING COULD YOU COULD YOU.

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:50.587
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT

00:54:50.654 --> 00:54:52.155
YES- INVESTMENT IN TRAINING

00:54:52.222 --> 00:54:54.624
RIGHT NOW AS THE TECHNOLOGIES

00:54:54.691 --> 00:54:55.625
ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED IT'S

00:54:55.692 --> 00:54:57.027
IMPORTANT WE BRING THE WORK

FORCE TO THE FUTURE. AND NOT.

00:54:59.462 --> 00:55:01.598
SLOWLY WE NEED TO RAPIDLY AS

QUICKLY AS THIS INDUSTRY. NEEDS

00:55:04.034 --> 00:55:06.269
TO CHANGE- I MENTION CARB. OF

00:55:06.336 --> 00:55:09.172
CARBS OF GOAL OF A ZERO

00:55:09.239 --> 00:55:11.408

AND THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO.

00:55:32.095 --> 00:55:35.765
CAPITAL IN EQUIPMENT THE THAT.

00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:40.470
ISN'T GONNA. BENEFITS. WHERE

00:55:40.537 --> 00:55:42.238

00:55:56.086 --> 00:55:57.454
THIS FIRST DID YOU HAVE ANY.

00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:58.888
THE ONE THING THAT I'VE BEEN

00:55:58.955 --> 00:56:00.090
READING A LOT ABOUT IS THIS

00:56:00.156 --> 00:56:02.325
AUTOMATION IN THE PORTS. AND IT

00:56:02.392 --> 00:56:03.560
IS OF GREAT CONCERN ESPECIALLY

00:56:03.626 --> 00:56:05.195
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR

00:56:05.261 --> 00:56:08.832
WORKERS- CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE

00:56:08.898 --> 00:56:10.233
BIT TO THAT MR FAMILY.

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:11.768
AUTOMATION'S AVAILABLE THERE'S

00:56:11.835 --> 00:56:13.403
A HUGE COST A HUGE CAPITAL

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:15.305
EXPENDITURES THE ONLY REASON-

00:56:15.371 --> 00:56:17.140
YOU'VE GOT THE LARGEST TERMINAL

00:56:17.207 --> 00:56:17.974
OPERATOR IN THE PORTS OF LA

00:56:18.041 --> 00:56:19.809
LONG BEACH. AUTOMATING RIGHT

00:56:19.876 --> 00:56:21.111
NOW IS BECAUSE THEY HAD DEEP

00:56:21.177 --> 00:56:23.046
POCKETS THERE THE LARGER

00:56:23.113 --> 00:56:24.114
SHIPPING COMPANY IN THE WORLD

00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:26.149
MASK. THEY WROTE A LARGE CHECK-

00:56:26.216 --> 00:56:28.952
THE OTHER- STEVEDORE. COMPANIES

00:56:29.018 --> 00:56:31.121
TERMINAL OPERATORS MANY DON'T

00:56:31.187 --> 00:56:32.956
HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AT

00:56:33.022 --> 00:56:35.191
THIS TIME TO AUTOMATE THAT'S

00:56:35.258 --> 00:56:37.660
WHY EVERYONE'S LOOKING.

00:56:37.727 --> 00:56:39.996
CONSCIOUS OF MY LABOR FORCE

00:56:40.063 --> 00:56:41.197
WHEN I HEAR THE TRUCKERS TALK

00:56:41.264 --> 00:56:43.299
ABOUT TRUCK TURN TIMES AND

00:56:43.366 --> 00:56:44.968
MOVING THE GOODS TO MARKET WE

00:56:45.034 --> 00:56:46.436
KNOW WHERE WE NEED TO MAKE THE

00:56:46.503 --> 00:56:48.571
IMPROVEMENTS BUT IN THE SAME

00:56:48.638 --> 00:56:50.640
TIME. NOT EVERYBODY- IN THE

00:56:50.707 --> 00:56:52.976
INDUSTRY HAS THE FINANCIAL

00:56:53.042 --> 00:56:53.843
RESOURCES- TO INVEST IN

00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:56.312
AUTOMATION AND I BELIEVE THAT-

00:56:56.379 --> 00:56:57.847
A LITTLE BIT OF TECHNOLOGY CAN

00:56:57.914 --> 00:56:59.682
GO A LONG WAY IN IMPROVING. OF

00:56:59.749 --> 00:57:02.385
THE- IS THAT WE NEED TO IMPROVE

00:57:02.452 --> 00:57:03.753
IN RIGHT NOW AND I THINK IF I

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.355
MAY JUST JUMP IN ONE OF THE

00:57:05.421 --> 00:57:06.723
THINGS AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:07.524
FROM THE STATE LAW. IS AT WE-

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:09.893
THAT. THAT TIME SO. YOU'RE A

00:57:09.959 --> 00:57:11.661
REGULATORY AGENCIES PICK A

00:57:11.728 --> 00:57:12.695
TECHNOLOGY IN OTHER WORDS

00:57:12.762 --> 00:57:14.497
THEY'RE NOT TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL.

00:57:14.564 --> 00:57:15.732
FOR EXAMPLE LECTURE VACATION

00:57:15.799 --> 00:57:17.767
LECTURE OCCASION CAN OFTEN MEAN

00:57:17.834 --> 00:57:19.836
AUTOMATION. AND SO THAT'S WHY

00:57:19.903 --> 00:57:21.471
WE NEED TO BE VERY COGNIZANT OF

00:57:21.538 --> 00:57:23.039
THESTATE LEVEL THAT WE'RE

00:57:23.106 --> 00:57:25.775
CREATING WISE POLICYTHAT IS

00:57:25.842 --> 00:57:29.913
TYPICALLY TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL SO

00:57:29.979 --> 00:57:32.482
THAT INNOVATION CAN HAPPEN ON

00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:33.349
THE GROUND WE CAN MOVE. YOU

00:57:33.416 --> 00:57:34.918
KNOW IF WE CAN BE AS- LEAST.

00:57:34.984 --> 00:57:37.587
MOVED SO THAT THAT'S ONE OF

00:57:37.654 --> 00:57:38.488
THINGS WE PUSHING EVEN FOR

00:57:38.555 --> 00:57:40.490
STRONG A STRONG VOICE ON THE

00:57:40.557 --> 00:57:41.658

01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:14.055
REGULATIONS COMING INTO PLAY

01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:15.523
AND HOW IT IMPACTS OUR OVERALL

01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:19.594
COMBAT IT COMPETITIVENESS. ON

01:28:19.661 --> 01:28:21.295
THAT SAID. BASED ON WHAT YOU

01:28:21.362 --> 01:28:21.896
KNOW WHAT YOU'VE HEARD US IS

01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:23.398
THAT WE ARE ALL AND WE WANTED

01:28:23.464 --> 01:28:24.298
TO THE GREEN THING WE'RE

01:28:24.365 --> 01:28:25.566
WILLING TO DO IT BUT WE JUST

01:28:25.633 --> 01:28:26.467
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

01:28:26.534 --> 01:28:27.368
DOING IN A WAY THAT IS

01:28:27.435 --> 01:28:29.137
SUSTAINABLE AND FEASIBLE. AND

01:28:29.203 --> 01:28:30.905
SO I'M NOT NAY REITERATE THE

01:28:30.972 --> 01:28:33.007
GOOD POINTS THAT MARIO MADE BUT

01:28:33.074 --> 01:28:34.008
I WOULD LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE

01:28:34.075 --> 01:28:36.144
BIT AT THE POLICY LEVEL WHERE I

01:28:36.210 --> 01:28:37.879
THINK THAT THE STATE COULD DO

01:28:37.945 --> 01:28:38.479
SOME THINGS THAT COULD. HELP

01:28:38.546 --> 01:28:41.549
THE DIFFERENCE ON. IN ONE SUCH

01:28:41.616 --> 01:28:42.350
AREA THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT

01:28:42.417 --> 01:28:44.318
POWER. SO WE'RE MOVING TO THE

01:28:44.385 --> 01:28:46.621
ZERO MISSION ECONOMY. DO YOU

01:28:46.688 --> 01:28:48.456
REALLY HAVE THE POWER LOCALLY

01:28:48.523 --> 01:28:50.191
TO SUPPORT THAT ZERO MISSION

01:28:50.258 --> 01:28:52.260
ECONOMY WELL WE'VE BEEN ASKED

01:28:52.326 --> 01:28:53.728
AND PASSED BY OUR LOCAL

01:28:53.795 --> 01:28:54.929
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:56.698
COMPANY UTILITY COMPANY TO PAY

01:28:56.764 --> 01:28:58.866
DO CONDUCT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:28:58.933 --> 01:28:59.834
THOUSAND DOLLAR STUDY. SEE IF

01:28:59.901 --> 01:29:02.937
THEY CAN MEET. THE OUR MANDATE

01:29:03.004 --> 01:29:04.105
OF A. R. B. AND I DON'T KNOW

01:29:04.172 --> 01:29:05.540
THAT'S FAIR TO PUT THAT ON THE

01:29:05.606 --> 01:29:07.642
BACKBONE OF THE PORTS. FOR US

01:29:07.709 --> 01:29:08.943
TO FIGURE OUT IF THE STATE HAS

01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:12.513
SUFFICIENT POWER TO FUEL- THIS

01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:14.649
MOVEMENT TWO ZERO EMISSION SO

01:29:14.716 --> 01:29:18.252
HOW CAN WE AT THE STATE LEVEL

01:29:18.319 --> 01:29:18.753
KIND OF DO SOME SORT OF

01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:19.754
ASSESSMENT. WE HAVE WHAT WE

01:29:19.821 --> 01:29:21.355
NEED AT THE UTILITY LEVEL DO

01:29:21.422 --> 01:29:24.826
ALL THESE. ON IN IN ZERO

01:29:24.892 --> 01:29:26.694
EMISSION MANDATES ON THE PORT

01:29:26.761 --> 01:29:28.763
SYSTEM FROM WHAT WE KNOW AT THE

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:30.565
VERY ONSET OF OUR DISCUSSIONS

01:29:30.631 --> 01:29:31.766
WITH SOUTH SEVEN CALIBER.

01:29:31.833 --> 01:29:32.967
CALIFORNIA EDISON WE MAY HAVE

01:29:33.034 --> 01:29:34.268
TO INVEST AS MUCH AS SEVENTY

01:29:34.335 --> 01:29:35.369
MILLION DOLLARS JUST FOR THE

01:29:35.436 --> 01:29:37.004
NEXT. ITERATION OF THE

01:29:37.071 --> 01:29:38.906
GUIDELINES SO THIS IS A VERY

01:29:38.973 --> 01:29:40.942
REAL ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO TALK

01:29:41.008 --> 01:29:43.444
ABOUT IN HOW WE ARE GOING TO.

01:29:43.511 --> 01:29:44.812
REALLY COME UP WITH THE POWER

01:29:44.879 --> 01:29:46.147
WE DON'T CREATE BLACK AT ALL

01:29:46.214 --> 01:29:46.948
THROUGHOUT BEEN TORE COUNTY

01:29:47.014 --> 01:29:48.850
BECAUSE- OF EMISSION REDUCTIONS

01:29:48.916 --> 01:29:51.853
AT THE PORT SO THERE HAS TO BE-

01:29:51.919 --> 01:29:53.287
CONVERSATION THERE ARE WE

01:29:53.354 --> 01:29:55.022
REALLY NEED TO BRING THE

01:29:55.089 --> 01:29:57.058
UTILITY. COMPANIES AND ALSO

01:29:57.125 --> 01:29:58.493
WANT TO JUST QUICKLY ON THE

01:29:58.559 --> 01:30:03.564
TERRACE. I'M RIGHT NOW WE HAVE

01:30:03.631 --> 01:30:04.232
THIS STATION A PORTABLE GAMING.

01:30:04.298 --> 01:30:04.899
AND WE HAVE POWER COMES IN THEY

01:30:04.966 --> 01:30:06.667
ALL LET US USE THAT. FOR

01:30:06.734 --> 01:30:09.303
PLUGGING IN. SHORT SIDE POWER.

01:30:09.370 --> 01:30:11.706
SO WE'D LIKE TO WORK WITH THE

01:30:11.773 --> 01:30:13.341
REGULATORS HERE IN SACRAMENTO

01:30:13.407 --> 01:30:14.909
IS HOW COULD WE GET. SOME

01:30:14.976 --> 01:30:17.411
FLEXIBILITY INTO THE CPUC TERRA

01:30:17.478 --> 01:30:19.013
TO USE THAT POWER FROM

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:20.114
SUBSTATIONS FOR OTHER THINGS-

01:30:20.181 --> 01:30:21.549
WE HAVE A CRANE RIGHT NOW THAT

01:30:21.616 --> 01:30:23.751
WE CAN'T PLUGIN. BECAUSE OF THE

01:30:23.818 --> 01:30:25.753
TARIFF ISSUE ELECTRIC GREEN AND

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:27.622
ELECTRIC CRANES SO IT'S RUNNING

01:30:27.688 --> 01:30:28.790
ON DIESEL NOW BUT IF WE COULD

01:30:28.856 --> 01:30:30.224
AMEND THE CHERUB SO WE COULD

01:30:30.291 --> 01:30:32.193
USE. THE POWER OF THAT

01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:34.762
SUBSTATION I IT WOULD GO A LONG

01:30:34.829 --> 01:30:36.430
WAY AND THERE ARE ALSO ISSUES

01:30:36.497 --> 01:30:37.765
OF THE CPC TARIFF RATES AND

01:30:37.832 --> 01:30:40.968
THAT ONCE YOU SO MUCH. AS YOU

01:30:41.035 --> 01:30:42.403
IN THESE EGREGIOUS. SO THEN CAN

01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:43.538
WE WORK WITH OUR LOCAL

01:30:43.604 --> 01:30:45.072
REGULATORS C. P. YOU SEE THAT

01:30:45.139 --> 01:30:46.474
THE UTILITY COMPANIES TO MAKE

01:30:46.541 --> 01:30:48.442
SURE THAT. THE FEES ARE FAIR

01:30:48.509 --> 01:30:50.178
AND THAT WE CAN USE POWER THAT

01:30:50.244 --> 01:30:53.147
WE HAVE- AVAILABLE FOR EXISTING

01:30:53.214 --> 01:30:54.849
TECHNOLOGIES AND THEN MAKE SURE

01:30:54.916 --> 01:30:55.716
DOWN THE ROAD AS WE'RE GOING

01:30:55.783 --> 01:30:56.984
THROUGH WITH ALL THESE MANDATES

01:30:57.051 --> 01:30:59.053
WE DID HAVE ENOUGH. POWER TO

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:01.589
FEEL WHAT IS BEING ASKED OF US.

01:31:01.656 --> 01:31:04.892
ARMED AND THEN- ONE OTHER AREA

01:31:04.959 --> 01:31:07.295
WERE ALL PLAYING FOR GRANTS YOU

01:31:07.361 --> 01:31:07.829
TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE

01:31:07.895 --> 01:31:09.263
PROBLEMS YOU KNOW WITH THE-

01:31:09.330 --> 01:31:10.531
BONNET TECHNOLOGY I THINK YOU

01:31:10.598 --> 01:31:11.399
WERE SPEAKING TO THAT'S NOT

01:31:11.465 --> 01:31:13.234
VERIFIED FOR THE ROW ROW. WELL

01:31:13.301 --> 01:31:14.569
WE'RE STILL GOING TO ASK FOR

01:31:14.635 --> 01:31:15.436
THESE GRANTS BECAUSE IT'S

01:31:15.503 --> 01:31:16.838
EXPENSIVE TECHNOLOGY AT THE

01:31:16.904 --> 01:31:18.873
FEDERAL LEVEL IF THERE'S SOME

01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:19.941
WAY THE STATE COULD HELP WITH

01:31:20.007 --> 01:31:21.976
TODAY YEAH. YOU'RE GOING. TO DO

01:31:22.043 --> 01:31:23.477
THESE. SO YOU COULD HELP US

01:31:23.544 --> 01:31:25.413
MAKE OUR GRANTS COMPATIBLE FOR

01:31:25.479 --> 01:31:27.114
FEDERAL FUNDING. I THINK THAT

01:31:27.181 --> 01:31:28.516
WOULD GO AWAY LONG WAY LIKE THE

01:31:28.583 --> 01:31:29.984
EPA DEAR GRANTS YOU HAVE TO

01:31:30.051 --> 01:31:31.652
HAVE VERIFY TECHNOLOGY WILL

01:31:31.719 --> 01:31:32.553
THEY WON'T EVEN CONSIDER.

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:33.688
TECHNOLOGIES THAT WERE PUSHING

01:31:33.754 --> 01:31:34.889
HERE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE

01:31:34.956 --> 01:31:36.357
THEY'RE NOT VERIFIED SO IF

01:31:36.424 --> 01:31:38.759
THERE'S SOME WAY TO. MARRY UP

01:31:38.826 --> 01:31:39.460

ACTUALLY AWESOME AT. AXIS

01:31:43.130 --> 01:31:44.498
FEDERAL FUNDING I THINK THAT

01:31:44.565 --> 01:31:45.933
WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IN THE

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.134
POLICY DISCUSSION WE CAN HAVE

01:31:47.201 --> 01:31:48.903
THE STATE LEVEL. AND THEN

01:31:48.970 --> 01:31:50.104
FINALLY JUST AS WE'RE LOOKING

01:31:50.171 --> 01:31:51.906
AT EMPLOYEE AND- TING A VARIETY

01:31:51.973 --> 01:31:54.642

MENTIONED BEFORE. ANOTHER

01:36:23.277 --> 01:36:24.979
UPCOMING REGULATION THE AT

01:36:25.045 --> 01:36:26.514
BIRTH REGULATION IS A BIG

01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:29.884
CONCERN FOR US- YOU KNOW. WE

01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:31.652
HAVE ALL PUBLIC BIRTHS WE DON'T

01:36:31.719 --> 01:36:33.721
HAVE TERMINAL OPERATORS AND SO

01:36:33.787 --> 01:36:35.089
THE PORT ITSELF WILL BEAR TE

01:36:35.156 --> 01:36:37.091
COST TO PLACE THESE. BONTA

01:36:37.158 --> 01:36:38.659
SYSTEMS BECAUSE WE ALSO WE'RE

01:36:38.726 --> 01:36:39.827
NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO PLUG IN

01:36:39.894 --> 01:36:40.828
ANY THE VESSELS THAT COME TO

01:36:40.895 --> 01:36:42.062
THE PORT OF STOCKTON THESE ARE

01:36:42.129 --> 01:36:44.598
TRAPPED VESSELS THAT COME. IN A

01:36:44.665 --> 01:36:45.866
ONE TWO THREE TIMES A YEAR AND

01:36:45.933 --> 01:36:47.268
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE THE

01:36:47.334 --> 01:36:51.038
INVESTMENT TO. INSTALL THE

INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED FOR SHORE

01:36:51.739 --> 01:36:53.407
POWER. SO THEN WE'RE LEFT WITH

01:36:53.474 --> 01:36:54.942
THE BONNET SYSTEM THAT'S THERE

01:36:55.009 --> 01:36:55.876
SO WE WOULD HAVE TO CONFIGURE

01:36:55.943 --> 01:36:57.811
ALL OF OUR BIRTHS WITH THIS

01:36:57.878 --> 01:36:59.547
BONNET SYSTEM. AND OUR CHANNELS

01:36:59.613 --> 01:37:00.748
NARAL SO WE'RE NOT GONNA BE

01:37:00.814 --> 01:37:02.183
ABLE TO UTILIZE A BARGE THAT

01:37:02.249 --> 01:37:04.318
CAN MOVE AROUND AND SO. THE

01:37:04.385 --> 01:37:06.120
INVESTMENT IS SIGNIFICANT AND

01:37:06.187 --> 01:37:08.389

BACK OF A BACK A ENVELOPE THE

01:37:16.463 --> 01:37:18.199
COST THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ARE.

01:37:18.265 --> 01:37:19.900
MORE THAN TEN ARE WHARFAGE

01:37:19.967 --> 01:37:23.871
COSTS AND- SO WE REALLY SEE-THAT AS DRIVING BUSINESS OUT OF

01:37:23.938 --> 01:37:26.874
THE STATE- PORTS THAT OUR OUR-

01:37:26.941 --> 01:37:27.741
BUSINESS THAT COULD COME TO

01:37:27.808 --> 01:37:29.343
STOCKTON WOULD SEE YOU KNOW

01:37:29.410 --> 01:37:31.512

01:41:10.597 --> 01:41:11.565
FOR A- THAT TECHNOLOGY DEAR

01:41:11.632 --> 01:41:13.500
SAYS. CAN'T BE IT'S NOT. SO

01:41:13.567 --> 01:41:14.668
THERE THERE ARE SYSTEMS OUT

01:41:14.735 --> 01:41:16.370
THERE IN DEVELOPMENT THE ONE

01:41:16.437 --> 01:41:18.672
HE'S REFERENCES AND KRAMER

01:41:18.739 --> 01:41:19.206
ACTUALLY READY BUT THERE'S

01:41:19.273 --> 01:41:21.141
ALSO. THAT'S JUST NOT A- RETURN

01:41:21.208 --> 01:41:22.776
FOR THE SMALLER PORT. EITHER SO

01:41:22.843 --> 01:41:24.144
IT'S- IT'S STILL VERY IMAGE.

01:41:24.211 --> 01:41:25.179
AND GROWING INDUSTRY AND

01:41:25.245 --> 01:41:26.413
PRIVATE TALK ABOUT IT YOU KNOW

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:28.148
DELAYS AND REGULATIONS THAT WE

01:41:28.215 --> 01:41:29.383
HAVE TIME TO CATCH UP WITH

01:41:29.450 --> 01:41:30.417
WITH. YOU KNOW THE R. AND D.

01:41:30.484 --> 01:41:32.352
AND ALL THAT. SO WITH REGARD TO

01:41:32.419 --> 01:41:35.255
THE ROWERS THE ROLL OFFS. WITH

01:41:35.322 --> 01:41:36.623
THAT POTENTIALLY BE A

01:41:36.690 --> 01:41:37.491
TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD BE THIS

01:41:37.558 --> 01:41:38.725
WITH THEM. THAT WOULDN'T MOST

01:41:38.792 --> 01:41:40.394
LIKELY HAVE TO. ACKNOWLEDGE IT

01:41:40.461 --> 01:41:41.728
BECAUSE FOR ONE IT IS MY

01:41:41.795 --> 01:41:43.030
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT'S VERY

01:41:43.096 --> 01:41:45.332
DIFFICULT TO RETROFIT ROW RUSH

01:41:45.399 --> 01:41:47.267
GETS FOR PER SIDE. OUR THESE.

01:41:47.334 --> 01:41:50.437
AN HAS OF THE SIZE OF THE PLEA.

01:41:50.504 --> 01:41:53.740
IS TO NOW. A CALL. EFFECTIVE SO

01:41:53.807 --> 01:41:57.044
YOU HAVE TO. THAT OKAY. YES

01:41:57.110 --> 01:41:59.413
THERE. AND THEN. QUESTION I

01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:08.355
THINK. BUT I KNOW LOTS OF OIL

01:42:08.422 --> 01:42:10.257
ON ELECTRICITY MIGHT NOT BE A

01:42:10.324 --> 01:42:12.693
GOOD IDEA. AND I KNOW THAT

01:42:12.759 --> 01:42:14.228
THERE WAS- IT. THERE'S BEEN

01:42:14.294 --> 01:42:15.262
SOME COMMUNICATION AROUND HERE

01:42:15.329 --> 01:42:16.296
ABOUT POTENTIALLY MAYBE THE AG

01:42:16.363 --> 01:42:17.764
MAYBE SOMEBODY TO DO IT NEEDS

01:42:17.831 --> 01:42:20.234
TO DO A FEASIBILITY. STUDY

01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:22.336
BEFORE CARP JUST ESTABLISHES A

01:42:22.402 --> 01:42:23.704
REGULATION I THINK THERE'S AN

01:42:23.770 --> 01:42:25.205
INDUSTRY MEMBER HERE WHO WANTED

01:42:25.272 --> 01:42:26.573
TO SPEAK TO THAT. I DON'T KNOW

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:29.009
IF MARGO'S HERE NOT. I DON'T

01:42:29.076 --> 01:42:31.912
SEE THEM BUT- THERE SHE HAS DID

01:42:31.979 --> 01:42:33.881
YOU DID YOU WISH TO PUT THE LID

01:42:33.947 --> 01:42:39.853
ON. ON THAT TOPIC OF IT. JUST

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:41.889
IDENTIFY YOURSELF ANSWER YET

01:42:41.955 --> 01:42:42.890
THANK YOU SO MUCH MARGO PARKS

01:42:42.956 --> 01:42:44.458
AND A HALF OF WITH BY- WESTERN

01:42:44.525 --> 01:42:46.927
STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION AT

01:42:46.994 --> 01:42:48.962
YOUR QUESTION AND- MISTER

01:42:49.029 --> 01:42:50.764
DONNELLY BELIEVE THAT. YOU KNOW

01:42:50.831 --> 01:42:51.965
WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF THE

01:42:52.032 --> 01:42:54.001
FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS ON THIS

01:42:54.067 --> 01:42:55.602
TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY IS EXTREMELY

01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:57.804
IMPORTANT- AS WAS DISCUSSED

01:42:57.871 --> 01:42:59.006
THERE'S- THERE ARE SOME

01:42:59.072 --> 01:43:01.542
TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE IN. PILOT

01:43:01.608 --> 01:43:02.976
STAGES THAT HAVE ALREADY

01:43:03.043 --> 01:43:05.612
ADOPTED BUT THAT IS ON THE- ON

01:43:05.679 --> 01:43:07.214
THE CARGO SIDE AS I UNDERSTAND

01:43:07.281 --> 01:43:09.116
IT NOT ON THE TANKER SIDE. AS

01:43:09.182 --> 01:43:09.850
YOU POINTED OUT THERE ARE

01:43:09.917 --> 01:43:12.319
CHALLENGES- WITH PLUGGING IN A

01:43:12.386 --> 01:43:16.490
TANKER- INTO A INTO A TERMINAL.

01:43:16.557 --> 01:43:17.291
THERE'S ALSO WHICH IS WITH THE

01:43:17.357 --> 01:43:19.393
AND THE SOCCER THE SENATE

01:43:19.459 --> 01:43:20.994
SYSTEM THAT HAVE YET BEEN

01:43:21.061 --> 01:43:22.296
WORKED OUT IT'S PREMATURE

01:43:22.362 --> 01:43:25.532
ACTION IS POINT EVEN TO DO THE

01:43:25.599 --> 01:43:29.536
TYPE OF. YOUR I'D- HE UM LIKE

01:43:29.603 --> 01:43:30.304
PILOT DEVON JUST BE WE HAVEN'T

01:43:30.370 --> 01:43:32.205
EVEN DONE THE RISK ASSESSMENT

01:43:32.272 --> 01:43:33.941
I'M ON THAT TECHNOLOGY AS THE

01:43:34.007 --> 01:43:35.309
LAST THING I THINK THAT ANYONE

01:43:35.375 --> 01:43:37.778
WANTS IS TO HAVE A PILOT

01:43:37.844 --> 01:43:39.846
PROJECT OR OR MUCH LESS A SHIP

01:43:39.913 --> 01:43:42.115
COME AND PUT A SOCK ON THEIR

01:43:42.182 --> 01:43:44.084
OVER THE BOILER AND HAVE AN

01:43:44.151 --> 01:43:46.920
EXPLOSION OF IT IN A PART

01:43:46.987 --> 01:43:48.922
SEVERAL NIGHTMARE. THERE ARE

01:43:48.989 --> 01:43:50.657
MANY STE IT HAPPEN. TECH CAN BE

01:43:50.724 --> 01:43:52.526
USED ARE A LOT OF INTERNATIONAL

01:43:52.593 --> 01:43:54.428
ORGANIZATIONS THAT DO THIS TYPE

01:43:54.494 --> 01:43:56.697
OF REGULATION SETTING- AND

01:43:56.763 --> 01:43:59.299
TESTING SO WE ENCOURAGE ON A

01:43:59.366 --> 01:44:00.300
ARE BEING WE'VE SPOKEN WITH

01:44:00.367 --> 01:44:01.735
THEM AT LENGTH AND I KNOW WITH

01:44:01.802 --> 01:44:03.737
THE PORTS OF YOU KNOW GETTING

01:44:03.804 --> 01:44:05.872
THE RIGHT STATE. OUT THE TO

01:44:05.939 --> 01:44:10.243
ASSESS HOW WE MOVE FORWARD WITH

01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:12.846
ASSESSING THIS TECHNOLOGY IS A-

01:44:12.913 --> 01:44:15.616
POINT. EVEN AS A- AS YOU WISH.

01:44:15.682 --> 01:44:16.883
TO STUDY THE FEASIBILITY.

01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:19.052
BEFORE A REGULATIONS ESTABLISH

01:44:19.119 --> 01:44:20.253
IS THAT CORRECT ABSOLUTELY I

01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:22.255
THINK OUR PRIMARY CONCERN HERE

01:44:22.322 --> 01:44:24.291
SAFETY- AND YOU KNOW AS THE

01:44:24.358 --> 01:44:25.292
PORTS POINTED OUT I THINK THAT

01:44:25.359 --> 01:44:26.760
THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS IN

01:44:26.827 --> 01:44:28.095
WHICH WE CAN MEET THE GOALS A

01:44:28.161 --> 01:44:30.464
RB HAS. AND WERE- WERE VERY

01:44:30.530 --> 01:44:32.032
EAGER TO WORK WITH AIR BE ON

01:44:32.099 --> 01:44:34.134
THAT AND YOU KNOW AT THIS POINT

01:44:34.201 --> 01:44:35.569
USING THOSE TECHNOLOGIES MAY

01:44:35.636 --> 01:44:37.704
NOT BE THE BEST. BEST PATH

01:44:37.771 --> 01:44:39.139
FORWARD BUT PERHAPS THERE ARE

01:44:39.206 --> 01:44:40.841
ALTERNATIVES. TO GETTING THESE

01:44:40.907 --> 01:44:43.510
EMISSIONS REDUCTION BEYOND WHAT

01:44:43.577 --> 01:44:44.344
THE PARTS OF ALREADY DONE WITH

01:44:44.411 --> 01:44:47.914
THIS TREMENDOUS. X. BUT THANK

01:44:47.981 --> 01:44:48.949
YOU OUR SPEAKERS TO YOU WISH TO

01:44:49.016 --> 01:44:52.285
ADD ANYTHING THE I JUST WANT TO

01:44:52.352 --> 01:44:54.488
ADD ONE MORE. IN EMPHASIZE

01:44:54.554 --> 01:44:55.622
RESEARCHER IN SOMETHING YOU

01:44:55.689 --> 01:44:57.257
SAID THAT I THINK IS VERY

01:44:57.324 --> 01:44:58.925
RELEVANT TO THIS DISCUSSION.

01:44:58.992 --> 01:45:00.727
WHICH IS WE NEED TO INNOVATE

01:45:00.794 --> 01:45:03.664
NOT REGULATE. AND WHEN YOU TALK

01:45:03.730 --> 01:45:05.332
ABOUT THE PORTS OF CALIFORNIA.

01:45:05.399 --> 01:45:07.634
WE HAVE BEEN INNOVATORS AGAIN

01:45:07.701 --> 01:45:10.037
THERE'S NO INDUSTRYTHAT HAS A

01:45:10.103 --> 01:45:12.339
RESUME THAT WE DO. IN SOUTHERN

01:45:12.406 --> 01:45:13.840
CALIFORNIA REPORTS OF BILLION A

01:45:13.907 --> 01:45:15.842
PORTS ALONG BEACH WITHIN A

01:45:15.909 --> 01:45:18.211
DECADE REDUCED EMISSIONS

01:45:18.278 --> 01:45:20.280
HARMFUL EMISSIONS FROM TRUCKS

01:45:20.347 --> 01:45:23.250
BY 90% NO ONE ELSE IN THIS

01:45:23.316 --> 01:45:25.952
COUNTRY HAS THAT RESUME SO WE

01:45:26.019 --> 01:45:27.721
FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO

01:45:27.788 --> 01:45:29.056
MISTER THAT WE COULD GO TO ZERO

01:45:29.122 --> 01:45:30.991
EMISSION BY THE GOAL YOUR THAT

01:45:31.058 --> 01:45:32.726
WE'VE INDICATED. SO I THINK ALL

01:45:32.793 --> 01:45:34.528
THE US IS THAT YOU CONTINUE TO

01:45:34.594 --> 01:45:37.164
ALLOW US TO INNOVATE AND MOVE

01:45:37.230 --> 01:45:37.898
FORWARD IN A PRACTICAL MATTER

01:45:37.964 --> 01:45:40.333
BECAUSE- IF THAT DOESN'T

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:42.736
HAPPEN. I THINK THE PRIOR

01:45:42.803 --> 01:45:43.837
SPEAKERS OF ALREADY ADDRESSED

01:45:43.904 --> 01:45:46.440
THE DIRE SITUATION WE ARE IN

01:45:46.506 --> 01:45:48.375
MARKET SHARE COMPETITIVENESS

01:45:48.442 --> 01:45:50.477
AND CALIFORNIA'S NOT THE FIFTH.

01:45:50.544 --> 01:45:55.582
LARGEST ECONOMY. FOR NO REASON.

01:45:55.649 --> 01:45:56.249
ONE OF THE BIG REASONS IS

01:45:56.316 --> 01:45:58.819
BECAUSE WE'VE HAD A GREAT PORT

01:45:58.885 --> 01:46:00.821
ACTIVE COMPLEX HERE. THAT'S

01:46:00.887 --> 01:46:02.989
