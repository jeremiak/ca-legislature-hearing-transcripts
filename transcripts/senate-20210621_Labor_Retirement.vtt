00:58:14.424 --> 00:58:15.859
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THERE'S A

COMPANY THAT'S OWNED BY

00:58:17.293 --> 00:58:20.597
SOMEBODY- AND THIS WOULD JUST.

00:58:20.663 --> 00:58:22.799
THE BILL AS AS WRITTEN WOULD

00:58:22.866 --> 00:58:24.901
NOT ALLOW DISCLOSURE AND THE

00:58:24.968 --> 00:58:26.603

NOT THAT IT'S A BIT. THE

THIS TYPE OF SITUATION. ON THE

00:58:37.113 --> 00:58:39.215
OTHER IS- THE COLLATERAL

SOMETHING THAT WE'RE OBVIOUSLY

00:58:41.751 --> 00:58:42.685
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT BECAUSE

00:58:42.752 --> 00:58:44.254
THESE LOANS. WOULD BE FAIRLY

00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:46.155
LONG TERM AND WOULD BECOME

KNOW HOW THOSE. LOANS WOULD

00:58:54.597 --> 00:58:56.332
WERE SECURED- BECAUSE

00:58:56.399 --> 00:58:58.301
COLLATERALS ALWAYS CONCERNED

00:58:58.368 --> 00:59:05.608
ANY TIME- THAT THERE'S LANDING-

00:59:05.675 --> 00:59:06.476
ISSUE THAT IS NOT A- THE THAT

00:59:06.542 --> 00:59:07.844
WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT

00:59:07.911 --> 00:59:09.145
THE TRONG. OF LONG I'M NOT

00:59:09.212 --> 00:59:10.680

RATE. AND WE REALLY WE DON'T

00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:20.590
SEE WHY THAT HAS TO BE THE

00:59:20.657 --> 00:59:23.693
EXAM. WHAT WE DO AGREE WITH THE

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:25.828
AUTHOR ABOUT IS IT IT'S GOING

00:59:25.895 --> 00:59:28.932
TO BE VERY HARD TO GET ANYONE.

00:59:28.998 --> 00:59:31.034
TO TRIED TO BORROW FROM CALPERS

00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:32.869
ASSUMING THAT CALPERS COULD

00:59:32.936 --> 00:59:34.504
EVEN GET COMPETENT STAFF TO DO

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:37.006
UNDERWRITING- IF THEY HAD TO

00:59:37.073 --> 00:59:41.945
DISCLOSE- AN OPEN THEIR BOOKS-

00:59:42.011 --> 00:59:42.478
AN OPEN THERE INVESTMENT

00:59:42.545 --> 00:59:44.113
COMMITTEE MEETINGS THAT OF THE

00:59:47.116 --> 00:59:48.952
PUBLIC SCRUTINY UNDER THE T. R.

00:59:49.018 --> 00:59:50.553
A. M. AND WE CERTAINLY. CAN

00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:52.655
SUPPORT THOSE OTHER THREE

00:59:52.722 --> 00:59:54.290
EXEMPTIONS AND YOU KNOW WOULD

00:59:54.357 --> 00:59:56.626
BE HAPPY WITH YOUR OPPOSITION

00:59:56.693 --> 00:59:58.394
IF THAT'S WHAT WAS ALL ALL THAT

00:59:58.461 --> 01:00:00.363
WAS IN THE BILL. BUT OUR

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:02.098
CONCERN IS THAT IF WE- IF THIS

01:00:02.165 --> 01:00:04.567
BECOMES AN ASSET HELD BY A

01:00:04.634 --> 01:00:08.671
PUBLIC TRUST FUND. AND IT'S

01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:10.940
OUTSIDE OF THE G. P. R. A. WHAT

01:00:11.007 --> 01:00:12.275
THE TERMS ARE HOW THIS IS GOING

01:00:12.342 --> 01:00:14.210
TO GET REPAID- WITH THE

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:16.713
INTEREST RATE IS THAT CETERA-

01:00:16.779 --> 01:00:19.248
IT'S REALLY STILL KIND OF.

01:00:19.315 --> 01:00:21.351
HOLLOW BUT I I'M REALLY GLAD TO

01:00:21.417 --> 01:00:23.052
HEAR THAT SOME POLITICIANS

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:25.221
BEING MADE BECAUSE WE OFFERED-

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:29.158

01:00:29.225 --> 01:00:31.928
THROUGH THROUGH- DANNY BROWN

01:00:31.995 --> 01:00:35.131
WHO WAS GREAT- IN- TALKING WITH

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:36.899
US BUT- COULDN'T BRING HIS BACK

01:00:36.966 --> 01:00:40.570
A GOOD ANSWER- JUST SUGGESTING

01:00:40.636 --> 01:00:42.505
THAT THESE THREE AREAS OF

01:00:42.572 --> 01:00:44.440
CONCERN BE REMOVED. BUT

01:00:44.507 --> 01:00:47.477
ALLOWING PRIVACY OF THE

01:00:47.543 --> 01:00:49.345
UNDERWRITING PROCESS BECAUSE-

01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:52.115
WE GET WHY BORROWERS- WOULDN'T

01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:53.483
WANT TO JUST OPEN YOUR BOOKS

01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:54.550
THAT THEY MIGHT NOT GET THE

01:00:54.617 --> 01:00:57.086
LOAN AND THEN THERE ARE STILL-

01:00:57.153 --> 01:00:59.856
SUBJECT TO SHOOT YOUR AGE SO- I

01:00:59.922 --> 01:01:00.857
THINK THAT WE'RE MAKING

01:01:00.923 --> 01:01:02.091
PROGRESS BUT I THINK WE'RE

01:01:02.158 --> 01:01:04.861
STILL VERY VERY CONCERNED- THAT

01:01:04.927 --> 01:01:12.168

HOPEFUL THAT WE CONTINUE. THIS

01:01:16.973 --> 01:01:18.408
CONGRESS AND MAKE IT PROGRESS

01:01:18.474 --> 01:01:20.710

I'M JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT

01:01:25.615 --> 01:01:27.316
LONG BY PLAYED MAYBE ASK THE

01:01:27.383 --> 01:01:29.152
AUTHOR. BECAUSE IT WAS

01:01:29.218 --> 01:01:30.620
IDENTIFIED THAT THERE WERE

01:01:30.686 --> 01:01:31.788
THREE MAJOR ISSUES AND TO

01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:33.456
ADDRESS BY AMENDMENTS AND THEN

THERE'S ONE MORE IN THE LONG

01:01:34.757 --> 01:01:36.259
TERM SO HOWEVER IT WAS

01:01:36.325 --> 01:01:38.294
DESCRIBED. IS THAT SOMETHING

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:40.430
YOU'RE STILL WORKING ON WITH

01:01:40.496 --> 01:01:41.998
THE OPPONENTS IS THAT SOMETHING

01:01:42.065 --> 01:01:44.000
YOU MIGHT CONSIDER THAT THERE'S

01:01:44.067 --> 01:01:45.902
A PLACE TO GO IS THIS MOVES TO

01:01:45.968 --> 01:01:47.570
JUDICIARY CHIPSET I THINK

01:01:47.637 --> 01:01:48.771
PIECES IN THERE I'M HAVE MISTER

01:01:48.838 --> 01:01:51.040
BROWN ANSWER THAT. HI I CENTS

01:01:51.107 --> 01:01:52.742
CONVERSATION WITH THEM- I THINK

YOU DAILY RUN TO GIVE CALPERS

01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:56.379
AYE AYE WHAT I WOULD POINT OUT

01:01:56.446 --> 01:01:56.813
AS WE DID HAVE SOME

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:58.815
CONVERSATIONS I THINK. IN IN

01:01:58.881 --> 01:01:59.782
THOSE CONVERSATIONS THEY WERE

01:01:59.849 --> 01:02:01.751
LOOKING FOR US TO EXEMPT THE

01:02:01.818 --> 01:02:03.519
ENTIRE LOAN AGREEMENT WHICH I

01:02:03.586 --> 01:02:06.022
THINK WE- YOU KNOW COULDN'T.

01:02:06.089 --> 01:02:08.591
COME TO THAT AGREEMENT- BUT

01:02:08.658 --> 01:02:09.692

THERE THE AMOUNT OF THE LOAN.

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:15.698

RECEIVING YOU KNOW THE

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:18.801
ANNUALIZED RETURNS SO THERE'S

01:02:18.868 --> 01:02:20.203
INFORMATION IN THERE I THINK

01:02:20.269 --> 01:02:21.604
THE ONE PIECE THAT'S PROBABLY

01:02:21.671 --> 01:02:24.073
MISSING IS THE DURATION OF THE

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:24.574
LOAN BUT I THINK THAT'S

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:25.675
SOMETHING. WE COULD PROBABLY

01:02:25.741 --> 01:02:28.444
WORK ON A AND- AND DISCLOSE BUT

01:02:28.511 --> 01:02:29.645
I THINK IT'S THE ENTIRE LOAN

01:02:29.712 --> 01:02:30.646
AGREEMENT BECAUSE THERE ARE

01:02:30.713 --> 01:02:32.615
SOME COVENANTS AND THINGS IN

01:02:32.682 --> 01:02:33.349
THERE THAT THE POWER WAS NOT

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.885
GOING TO WANT. OUT THERE FOR

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:38.287
COMPETITIVE REASONS. FOUR WELL

01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:40.022
I WOULD JUST SUGGEST WITH THE

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:41.591
ONE THING YOU SAID STILL MIGHT

01:02:41.657 --> 01:02:43.526
BE ABLE TO BE THERE TO CONTINUE

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:45.528
TO WORK ON THAT AND SEE IF. BY

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:47.563
THE TIME YOU GET TO JUDICIARY

01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:49.232
THERE'S AN AMENDMENT THAT THAT

01:02:49.298 --> 01:02:51.501
ALLOWS FOR THAT THERE BUT- THAT

01:02:51.567 --> 01:02:53.436
WOULD ADDRESS IN SOME MANNER

01:02:53.503 --> 01:02:55.238
THE THREE MAJOR POINTS THAT

01:02:55.304 --> 01:02:57.306
HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. THE N.

01:02:57.373 --> 01:02:59.909
ANYWAY THANK YOU IT AND I WOULD

01:02:59.976 --> 01:03:03.746
JUST MAKE AS A COMMENT. THE ED.

01:03:03.813 --> 01:03:06.315
I READ ALL THIS I HAVE BEEN

01:03:06.382 --> 01:03:10.052
FOLLOWING AT BEST I CAN AND IN

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:11.420
THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WERE

01:03:11.487 --> 01:03:13.456
SIDE BARS THAT HAD IN RELATION

01:03:13.523 --> 01:03:14.557
TO THESE AMENDMENTS THERE WAS

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:15.892
THE DISCUSSION THAT THIS IS

01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:17.827
STILL COMING TO JUDICIARY AND

01:03:17.894 --> 01:03:20.329
SO I THINK THAT THERE STILL CAN

01:03:20.396 --> 01:03:22.565
BE SOME OF THESE THINGS BUT

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:24.467

THAT LANGUAGE TO EXTEND IT.

01:27:39.253 --> 01:27:40.788

OUR MINIMUM WAGE WENT UP AT A

01:27:41.889 --> 01:27:43.124

EVEN QUALIFY FOR THE SEVENTY

01:27:44.392 --> 01:27:46.027
PERCENT. SO EVEN A MINIMUM WAGE

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:47.996
WORKER IS ONLY GETTING 60% OF

01:27:48.062 --> 01:27:49.897

01:27:49.964 --> 01:27:51.899
NO WAY I HAVE YET TO FIND

01:27:51.966 --> 01:27:53.735

INTERESTINGLY- ARE IN OUR FLOOR

02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:04.904
DEBATE EARLIER TODAY- I TALKED

02:04:04.970 --> 02:04:06.639
ABOUT THE FACT THAT I HEADED AN

02:04:06.705 --> 02:04:08.741
AIDS SERVICE AGENCY THIRTY

02:04:08.808 --> 02:04:10.976
YEARS AGO RIGHT NOW. AND THAT

02:04:11.043 --> 02:04:14.914
THERE WERE. OUR FAMILIES THAT

02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:17.283
WERE BIOLOGICALLY RATE RELATED

02:04:17.349 --> 02:04:19.218
BUT THERE WERE NO RIGHTS OF THE

02:04:19.285 --> 02:04:21.720
SPOUSES AND THAT THEY WOULD

02:04:21.787 --> 02:04:24.757
COME INTO TOWN. AND TAKE HALF A

02:04:24.824 --> 02:04:26.625
HOUSE WHEN SOMEBODY PASSED AWAY

02:04:26.692 --> 02:04:28.160
EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE STRANGE

02:04:28.227 --> 02:04:31.263
THEY WOULD KEEP THE PARTNER

02:04:31.330 --> 02:04:33.299
FROM VISITING IN THE HOSPITAL.

02:04:33.365 --> 02:04:36.202
THERE WERE INCREDIBLE FUNCTION

02:04:36.268 --> 02:04:38.137
WHAT WE DID IS WE AS A

02:04:38.204 --> 02:04:40.005
GOVERNMENT ADMINISTERED PEOPLE

02:04:40.072 --> 02:04:42.675
RECOGNIZED WHAT WAS LACKING IN

02:04:42.741 --> 02:04:45.611
THAT AN EXTENDED PROTECTIONS

02:04:45.678 --> 02:04:48.314
AND MADE SURE THAT THINGS LIKE

02:04:48.380 --> 02:04:50.449
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN WITHIN

02:04:50.516 --> 02:04:52.084
THAT MORE TRADITIONAL LEGAL

02:04:52.151 --> 02:04:55.020
FRAMEWORK OF MARRIAGE OR OR TAX

02:04:55.087 --> 02:04:56.488
MEANT. AND I THINK THAT WHILE

02:04:56.555 --> 02:04:59.925
THAT WAS CONTROVERSIAL- OF

02:04:59.992 --> 02:05:01.927
MOVIE IT WAS RECOGNIZED ALSO ON

02:05:01.994 --> 02:05:03.796
THE FLOOR THAT NOW THERE'S EVEN

02:05:03.863 --> 02:05:05.497
A MAJORITY OF REPUBLICANS

02:05:05.564 --> 02:05:08.601
SUPPORT MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND A

02:05:08.667 --> 02:05:10.336
I THINK THAT THE COUNTRY MOVED

02:05:10.402 --> 02:05:12.071
TO WHERE THE JUSTICE WAS AND

02:05:12.137 --> 02:05:13.806
WHERE THE PEOPLE WERE IN THOSE

02:05:13.873 --> 02:05:15.741
RELATIONSHIPS. WHAT I THINK

02:05:15.808 --> 02:05:17.009
THIS BILL DOES IS TAKE THE NEXT

02:05:17.076 --> 02:05:20.045
STEP BECAUSE THERE ARE EXACTLY.

02:05:20.112 --> 02:05:21.714
THOSE KIND OF RELATIONSHIPS

02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:23.215
THAT MIGHT BE NONTRADITIONAL

02:05:23.282 --> 02:05:26.118
BUT ARE REAL AND I HAD ONE IN

02:05:26.185 --> 02:05:28.020
MY FAMILY WHERE. MY BROTHER AND

02:05:28.087 --> 02:05:30.322
HIS PARTNER'S BEST FRIEND FOR

02:05:30.389 --> 02:05:32.324
TWENTY FIVE YEARS. THE DAY

02:05:32.391 --> 02:05:34.159
ENDED UP BEING HIS CARE GIVERS

02:05:34.226 --> 02:05:36.428
AT THE END AND DOING MANY OTHER

02:05:36.495 --> 02:05:38.931
THINGS AND WHILE THEY WERE

02:05:38.998 --> 02:05:40.165
PRIVILEGED IN A WAY THAT THEY

02:05:40.232 --> 02:05:42.301
DIDN'T. HAVE TO STRUGGLE WITH

02:05:42.368 --> 02:05:44.603
THEY WERE IN A SITUATION THAT

02:05:44.670 --> 02:05:47.006
THIS BILL COVERS. ARE THEY

02:05:47.072 --> 02:05:47.840
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO

02:05:47.907 --> 02:05:49.275
TAKE LEAVE WHEN THEY WERE GOING

02:05:49.341 --> 02:05:51.477
TO HELP THAT PERSON TO THE LAST

02:05:51.543 --> 02:05:53.412
MONTHS AND WEEKS OF HIS LIFE.

02:05:53.479 --> 02:05:56.882
AND SO V. E. R. I GET THAT

02:05:56.949 --> 02:05:58.651
THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER OR

02:05:58.717 --> 02:06:00.586
NOT THIS WOULD BE ABUSED BUT

02:06:00.653 --> 02:06:02.321
ACTUALLY. AS ONE OF THE

02:06:02.388 --> 02:06:03.756
