CALIFORNIA'S UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW ALLOWS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND CITY ATTORNEYS. OF CITIES WITH A POPULATION OF OVER SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND.

A BY GIVING SEIZE THE STATE'S THREE LARGEST COUNTY COUNCIL OFFICES LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO SANTA CLARA THE AUTHORITY TO BRING- THE SO CALLED YOU SEE- ACTIONS SB FOR SIXTY ONE. WILL CLOSE AN EXISTING FORSMAN GAP AND ENABLE THOSE COUNTY COUNCILS TO BETTER PROTECT CONSUMERS IN THE PUBLIC AND PROMOTE FAIR COMPETITION. THE BILL ALSO ALIGNS WITH OTHER IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTION STATUTES IN CALIFORNIA. SUCH AS A FALSE ADVERTISING LAW WHICH BROADLY AUTHORIZES COUNTY COUNCILS TO COMBAT DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES.

SANTA CLARA COUNTY URGES THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT SB FOUR SIXTY ONE THE BILL HAS A NARROW LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL. THAT WOULD ALIGN THE AUTHORITY OF THE THREE LARGEST COUNTY COUNCIL OFFICES LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO SANTA CLARA. WITH THE KERN FORTY VARSITY TWENTY COUNTERPARTS TO BRING ON PER CAPITA LOCATIONS. ANY COUNCILS ALREADY HAVE SIMILAR CORDY UNDER ANOTHER KEY CONSUMER PROTECTION STATUTE THE FALSE ADVERTISING LAW. MISALIGNMENT WE TO GET IN ADDITION ARE OFFICES BRING. AND AFTER A HEALTHY TOGETHER.

WE HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO PURSUE THESE MATTERS ON A TRACK WHERE HE COULD RECORD OF SUCCESSFULLY MITIGATING COMPLEX FALSE ADVERTISING CONSUMER AND ENVIRONMENTAL CASES. THIS BILL WILL EXPAND OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE THAT IMPORTANT WORK. L.% A. COUNTY AS THE PRIMARY PROVIDER OF SAFETY NET SERVICES FOR OVER TEN MILLION PEOPLE. ARE COUNTIES DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AND BUSINESS AFFAIRS THE OPEN INVESTIGATE CONSUMER COMPLAINTS INVOLVING VULNERABLE POPULATIONS INCLUDING THE ELDERLY VETERANS IMMIGRANTS AND THOSE EXPERIENCING POVERTY. INDEED IN TWENTY TWENTY ACADEMY SEED OVER EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED CONSUMER COMPLAINT. NOT HAVING FULL AUTHORITY UNDER THE- UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW HAS LIMITED OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND LIMITED OUR OPTIONS ON IMPORTANT ISSUES LIKE ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH MATTERS. FOR EXAMPLE THE EXCITED FACILITY IN VERNON OPERATED UNLAWFULLY FOR DECADES RELEASING LED INTO THE COMMUNITY AND IMPACTING PUBLIC HEALTH. OUR LEGAL OPTIONS WERE LIMITED BCAUSE EXIDE IS NOT IN THE UNINCORPORATED INCORPORATED AREA OF THE COUNTY AND WAS NOT VIOLATING A COUNTY BOARD. IF SB FOUR SIXTY ONE HAD BEEN THE LAW YEARS AGO WE COULD HAVE TAKEN ACTION AGAINST EXIDE FOR VIOLATING STATE AND FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. SB FOUR SIXTY ONE CAN HELP US PROTECT IMPACTED COMMUNITIES AND PREVENT ANOTHER ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE. LIKE EXCITED. RECOGNIZING AN UNMET NEED MY OFFICE ESTABLISHED IN AFFIRMATIVE LITIGATION CONSUMER PROTECTION DIVISION WHICH IS STAFFED WITH FIFTEEN EXPERIENCE RETURNING MANY FROM OTHER PUBLIC PROSECUTOR OFFICES.

EIGHTY EIGHT RESPECTS THE ROLE PLAYED BY COUNTY COUNCIL BUT REGRETFULLY OPPOSES THIS BILL FIRST THE BILL EXTENDS FULL YOU FEEL AUTHORITY TO ATTORNEYS WHO HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY SERVED AS PUBLIC PROSECUTORS. UCL ACTION BROUGHT IN THE NAME OF THE PEOPLE IS NOT A NORMAL CIVIL LAWSUIT IS A LAW ENFORCEMENT CASE WHICH CAN RESULT IN SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES TO A BUSINESS. INCLUDING AN INJUNCTION AND SUBSTANTIAL CIVIL PENALTIES PUBLIC PROSECUTORS ARE NOT LAWYERS FOR A PRIVATE PARTY THEY'RE TRYING TO FALL SPECIAL ETHICAL GUIDELINES TO ENSURE THAT JUSTICE IS DONE FROM ALL SIDES. NOT JUST THE PLAINTIFFS COUNTY COUNCIL PERFORMING DIFFERENT ROLE. STARKLY SERVED AS ATTORNEYS FOR THEIR COUNTIES THE ACTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO ULTIMATE APPROVAL BY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN THIS RESPECT THEY'RE MORE LIKE ATTORNEYS REPRESENTING A CLIENT IN PROSECUTORS REPRESENTING A SOVEREIGN. IN ADDITION COUNTY COUNCIL SOMETIMES CONTRACTED OUT LITIGATION WORK- CONTINGENCY FEE LAWYERS WHICH UNDERMINES THE PROSECUTOR IN THE TRIAL OF THE THAT. IS THE CORNERSTONE OF UCL ENFORCEMENT. SECOND UCLA ITS CURRENT OF THE- BY AN ISSUE PASSED BY THE WAY IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR. IT GAVE YOU SEE ALL FORTY TWO COUNTY COUNCIL THE ONLY A TO ORDINANCES. IN ONLY WITH AGREEMENT OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY. THIS BILL WOULD EXPAND THE SCOPE OF COUNTY COUNTY THE FORTY IN A WAYTHAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF THE VOTERS. FINALLY THIS BILL SEEKS TO FILL A GAP THAT DOES NOT EXIST- COUNTY TO MIGHT BE AFFECTED BY THE BILL. ALREADY HOW DISTRICT ATTORNEYS WITH ROBUST CONSUMER PROTECTION UNIT. SOMETHING I CAN ATTEST TO BASED ON PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. AND ALREADY HAVE CITIES IN EXCESS OF SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. WHICH ALSO HAVE INDEPENDENT UCL AUTHORITY AUTHORIZED BY THE ELECTORATE. ACTING OF THE BACKSTOP TO ALL OF US IS THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL WHICH ITSELF HAS AN ACTIVE CONSUMER LAW SECTION. IN SHORT. THIS BILL SOLVES A PROBLEM THAT DOES NOT EXIST WHILE CREATING OTHERS THAT WILL PERSIST. HE D. A. URGES YOU TO VOTE NOW THANK YOU.

AND I SHOW NO COMMENT AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISS MODERATE LET'S BRING IT BACK HERE THE CHAMBER- I SEE SORT OF BORED JUSTIN CENTER COUPLE EURO- CENTER BORDERS. IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK ON THE BILL. PLEASE THANK YOU. WHEN WE WERE THINGISBACK IN TWENTY NINETEEN COULD HAVE BEEN TWENTY SIX CENTREBOARD DISS YOUR MICROPHONE ON THAT. IT IS THAT BETTER WELL THERE WE GO. THANK YOU THANK YOU. WITH SOME COOPERATIVE SIX WILTING YEAH- WE DEAL WITH AN ISSUE- OR A COUPLE OF ISSUES WE'RE BUYING- THE CITY ATTORNEY- I BELIEVE THIS WAS IN THE CITY OF CONTACTS WAS WANTED TO EXPAND THE AUTHORITIES OF THE CITY ATTORNEY. AND THIS IS KIND OF AN INVERTED ISSUE HERE. AND HAVING SERVED IN BOTH THE CITY CAPACITY AS WELL AS A COUNTY CAPACITY. THERE CAN BE A LOT OF FRICTION BETWEEN THESE TWO ENTITIES. AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE REVENUE SHARING AGREEMENTS IN MIKE MY CONCERN THAT I RAISED IN THE TWO ITEMS. THAT WE DEALT WITH THE JUDICIARY- LAST YEAR THE YEAR BEFORE KIND OF SPOKE TO. WHAT ARE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THIS SO I STILL HAVE THOSE CONCERNS NOW THAT WE COULD BE PITTING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE REVENUE SOURCE AND SO. I THINK LOOKING AT THIS RIGHT NOW THE AG. GETS HALF OF THE PROCEEDS AND THE OTHER HALF GOES INTO A WORD STATE DOES HEATHER HALF GOES INTO THE COUNTY. AND THE CITY TAKES ONE HALF. IN THE DA TAKES A HUNDRED FOR THE COUNTY THAT THEY REPRESENT. UNDER THIS SITUATION THE MOTIVATION COULD ENTIRELY BE FORESEEABLE THAT COUNTIES IN CITIES ARE GOING TO BE PITTED AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IN ORDER TO EXTRACT THE LARGEST SHARE. OF THESE DOLLARS IN BEING CLIMATE ENGAGE IN A GAME OF ONE UPSMANSHIP GOING AFTER THE MOST HIGHLY LUCRATIVE VIOLATORS. AND I DIDN'T KNOW IF- IF THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL WHO MIGHT HOLD IN THE HIGHEST REGARD- I THINK HE'S A ACTUALLY FIND GENTLEMAN AND IN HIS TAKING ON THIS ISSUE I COMMEND IMPORT. BUT MAYBE I CAN POSE A QUESTION ON THROUGH THE CHAIR TO THE AUTHOR- YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ARE IN RESPONSE TO. THAT INTERNAL FRICTION THAT WE ARE NOW PERPETUATING. BECAUSE I VOTED AGAINST THE ONE IN SAN DIEGO BEFORE FOR THAT EXACT VERY REASON- THE SENATE CORTESE I'M SORRY TO CUT YOU ALSO REPORTERS. CORRECT SENATE CORTESE D. WOULD YOU CAN RESPOND TO YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO CLOSE. A RESPOND BRIEFLY YOU FALL RIGHT THE PROCEDURE- THANK YOU SENATOR ROOM FOR THE QUESTION IS A FORMER COUNTY SUPERVISOR AND- THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBER AND- THE THIRD LARGEST CITY IN THE STATE- FEEL LARGEST COUNTY THE BAY AREA I'M QUITE FAMILIAR WITH- THE GENERAL ISSUE THE- YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL TENSION. THIS BILL FIRST OF ALL UNLIKE. THE BILLS THAT YOU- PARKING BY TO. I THINK IT TO NINETEEN IS REALLY NOT A DISTRICT BILL LEAVES EVERYTHING INTACT IN TERMS OF DISTRIBUTION. I THINK IT'S TELLING- THAT- AMONG THE SUPPORTERS- WE HAVE A LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS- IN THE WE ALSO. HAVE THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WE ARE WE DO NOT HAVE OPPOSITION FROM- LOS ANGELES OR SAN JOSE WHICH IS THE COUNTY SEAT OF COURSES IN ACCOUNTING SO THIS BILL. IS ONLY DEALINGWITH THREE COUNTY SAN DIEGO LOS ANGELES AND IN SANTA CLARA AGAIN WHICH I WOULD HOPE. HOPE ALLEVIATE YOUR CONCERN TO SOME DEGREE RELATIVE TO. OTHER TENSIONS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY EXIST IN. A FIFTY FIVE OTHER COUNTIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE THIS THIS BILL THIS IS INTENDED. ONLY TO PROVIDE- THIS OPPORTUNITY CLOSES GAP JUST IN THOSE THREE COUNTIES. AND THEN I'LL I'LL CONCLUDE THANK YOU YES I'M I'M I AM AWARE THAT ONLY PERTAINS TO THESE THREE WHAT I ALSO. AM ACUTELY AWARE OF IS- MISSION CREEP. THAT WHEN YOU ARE CREATING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE JURISDICTION TO EXPAND ITSELF ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CAN BE RELYING ON- THE REVENUE IN THE PROCESS. IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE MORE IN MORE BODIES OF LAW IN MORE MORE JURISDICTIONS BEGIN WANTING TO- EXPAND THEIR CAPABILITIES SO EVEN THOUGH IT'S ONLY PERTAINING HERE. THERE MIGHT BE- IT'S EXPECTED THAT THIS WILL CONTINUE. INTO THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE CYCLE IN THERE AFTER. THAT ALL ALL THE CITIES AND ALL THESE COUNTIES ARE GOING TO WANT TO DO. THIS IN THEIR OWN RESPECTIVE WAYS AND THAT THAT'S MY ONLY CONCERN- YEAH BUT I APPLIED TO- THAT THE THIS IS ACTUALLY A DISTRICT BILL IN SOME RESPECTS. THANK YOU THANK YOU- I SENT A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR PER SHEET THAT I AM. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY THAT CAME OUT IN REGARDS TO THE EXIDE- EXAMPLE I WAS LOOKING FOR EXAMPLE FOR WHEN THIS WOULD BE. A GOOD THING TO ALLOW AND THAT'S PROBABLY THE BEST ONE THAT THAT I CAN THINK OF CYPRESS SHEET THAT AND I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE IS WE LOOKED AT THIS ISSUE- A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO IN REGARDS TO THE BIGGER CITIES AND WE ALLOW THE CITIES TO DO THIS BECAUSE THERE IS A REAL GOOD EXAMPLE OF- MALFEASANCE. AND FRAUDULENT BEHAVIOR THAT WAS HAPPENING THAT- THAT WAS REQUIRED REQUIRED- THIS CITY OF LA TO BE INVOLVED IN. IN BEING ABLE TO PROSECUTE THESE KIND KINDS OF CASES. I'M I AM I GUESS I'M WONDERING. I SEE THIS AS THE FIRST STEP. IN BIGGER COUNTIES IN BIGGER CITIES JOINING AND I AND I JUST WONDER IF THERE'S ANY. REASON FOR THIS TO SAY- A BIG CITY OVER SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND OTHER THAN JUST MAKING IT A DISTRICT BILL AS AS WITH ARTICULATED- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BIG CITIES THAT DON'T HAVE DISABILITY THERE'S THERE ARE A NUMBER OF A BIG COUNTIES THAT PROBABLY COULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED AND I'M IF I'M WONDERING IF THE AUTHOR COULD COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY THAT WHY THIS PARTICULAR CUT OFF. ON AND HOW THAT- AND THEN AND THEN I DIDN'T SEE AND I DIDN'T REMEMBER IF IT IF THERE'S A CASE IF THIS WAS TO MOVE FORWARD IF THERE'S A CASES PROSECUTED BY A COUNTY DOES THE COUNTY RECEIVED A 100% OF THE FUNDS OR IS IT ON THIS IS A SPLIT WITH THE CITY THAT IS THE JURISDICTION THAT IT'S LOCATED IN. YES THANK YOU FOR USING EARLIER THANK YOU. SENATOR DAISY- THANK YOU- MISTER. LET ME ANSWER THE QUESTION WITH REGARD TO. FOR THE ORIGINS OF THE BILL AND I'D LIKE TO. A DEFERRED TO MISTER WILLIAMS JAMES WILLIAMS ON THE ISSUE DISTRIBUTION- BETWEEN CITIES AND COUNTIES BUT AS HE IS A COUNTY COUNCIL SANTA CLARA COUNTY AND- IS EVEN MORE FAMILIAR THAN I AM WITH THE- DISTRIBUTION. OF THIS BILL S. AS MR WILLIAMS SAID IN HIS OPENING- AT SANTA CLARA COUNTY IS- A VERY LARGE AND ROBUST- COUNTY COUNCIL OFFICE THAT WAS LAST YEAR- NAME THE TOP- PUBLIC SECTOR. LAW OFFICE IN THE COUNTRY IN HIS HAS A LEAD ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES- RELATED AND INCLUDING- ISSUES- IN IN OTHER STATUTES THAT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO BRING- IN TERMS OF CONSUMER PROTECTION- THE LEAD PAINT CASE FOR EXAMPLE THAT- WAS RECENTLY. SETTLED WAS- HAD ITS ORIGINS IN THE COUNTY SANTA CLARA THERE'S A LONG HISTORY OF THE KIND OF WORK. THE CITY OF SAN JOSE- TYPICALLY DOES NOT TAKE THESE YOU SEE ALL CASES WHICH ARE ALSO GOES BACK TO THE PRIOR QUESTION TO SOME DEGREE- THERE HASN'T BEEN TENSION AROUND OR COMPETITION. THERE ON AND THAT WAS THE ORIGIN OF. OF REALLY OF THIS BILL- AS A DISTRICT BILL IN AGAIN COMING FROM SOMEBODY WHO SERVED THERE AND WHO KNOWS INTIMATELY- THE CAPACITY OF THE COUNTY COUNSEL'S OFFICE IN THE- THE POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE COUNTY COUNCIL OFFICE TO PROVIDE CONSUMER PROTECTION. UNDER THIS PROPOSED MEASURE- AT AS WE DEVELOP THE BILL OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY- EXPRESSED INTEREST AS DID SAN DIEGO IN THE CUT OFF OF SEVEN EARNED FIFTY THOUSAND POPULATION WAS WHAT WAS LOOK TO IN PART BECAUSE I WAS A CUT OFF PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED FOR CITIES- SO TO BE CONSISTENT- IT REALLY JUST ENDED UP- FALLING IN PLACE THAT WAY SO TO SPEAK BUT BUILT BY A DENTIST. TO REASSURE THE BILL SPEAKS TO- IT ENABLING JUST THOSE THREE COUNTIES JUST THOSE THREE COUNTIES- IN AND WE'RE NOT SEEING ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT AT THIS TIME OF THE DISTRIBUTION I WOULD DEFER TO. MISTER WILLIAMS ABOUT- OKAY WITH CHAIR. AND I'M CERTAINLY AVAILABLE FOR OTHER QUESTIONS AS WELL- THANK YOU CENTER CORTESE MISTER WILLIAMS ARE YOU ON THE PHONE DO YOU CARE TO RESPOND. YES MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SENATOR CORTESE AND THANK SENATOR COMING AT ALL- WHAT I WOULD SAY ON THE DISTRIBUTION IS THIS BILL MAKES NO CHANGES WHATSOEVER TO THE CURRENT. DISTRIBUTION PROVIDED IN THE STATUTE. THAT MEANS THAT IF THERE IS BACK IN ACTION WHERE CITY ATTORNEY AND COUNTY COUNCIL OR CITY ATTORNEY AND DISTRICT ATTORNEY. IS INVOLVED JOINTLY IN THE CASE SAID THAT THE PENALTIES ARE SPLIT. EQUALLY BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE COUNTY. AND UNDER EXISTING LAW THE CASE THAT JUST INVOLVES. ON THE COUNTY WITH THAT DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE OR COUNTY COUNSEL'S OFFICE. THE PENALTIES. ARE PROVIDED TO THE COUNTY TREASURER. THANK YOU- THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I PROJECT THAT AND I'M I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY I JUST NEED TO SAY THAT- THAT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE. ROBUST CONSUMER PROTECTION OFFICES WITHIN THESE COUNTIES MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN MY MIND BECAUSE IT MAKES SENSE TO EXTEND TO THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC WHICH IS A GOOD THING- SO I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU. I'M SORRY THANK YOU CYNICAL ZERO SAN WEARY OF QUESTION. ARE THANKS IS MANY OF ITS DIFFERENT.

AMONG THE COUNTY COUNCIL'S IN THE CITY ATTORNEYS IN THE DA'S. AND I SERVICES A FORMER. DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY IN THE SAN FRANCISCO CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE FOR WHICH ALL THE RESPECT L. A. AS THE BEST. OF THE BLOG ENTRY. BUT YOU KNOW. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF THESE- AND IS IF YOU'RE A LARGE TECH COUNTY- CITY. D. A. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO GOING TO COURT AND TO BRING THESE. PUBLIC PROTECTION LAWSUIT. I HAVE TO SAY THAT I VERY MUCH DISAGREE WITH- WINDOWS FROM THE- DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S ASSOCIATION THIS IS NOT. A CRIMINAL SUIT THIS IS A CIVIL LAWSUIT- AND I DON'T THINK IT. IS ACCURATE TO SAY THAT THIS IS THE SAME. AS WHEN A PROCESS OF A DIEGO'S IN THE COURT ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA TO TRY TO PUT SOMEONE IN JAIL- THIS IS A CIVIL LAWSUIT AND DISCOUNTED. WITH SUCH A THE LARGER COUNTY COUNCIL TO TERMS OFFICE. HAVE SIGNIFICANT EXPERTISE OFTEN. SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPERTISE THAN DA'S OFFICES HAVE. IN TERMS OF.

WOULD LIKE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR- MISTER TURN MEMBERS TODAY I'M PRESENTING SP TWO NINE SEVEN- AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR OF FOR ALL THE EIGHT OF GUIDANCE OF I HAVE AMENDMENTS THAT WILL BE INCORPORATED IF THE BILL WERE TO LEAVE THE- OF THE COMMITTEE- AND I BELIEVE THE AMENDMENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. SALAMI CLARIFY SOME OF THE REST OF YOUR ARE YOU ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS HERE ARE YOU SAYING YOU WILL ACCEPT THEM IN THE FUTURE THEY THEY WILL BE INCORPORATED IF THIS ALL RIGHT IF WE MOVE TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE LIMIT LET ME MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE NO AMBIGUITY HERE DO YOU ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS AS LISTED ON PAGE SIX SEVEN COMMENT THREE THE ANALYSIS- THERE ARE THE- AMENDMENTS THAT ARE- THAT THE ADDITIONAL PENALTIES WILL BE FOCUSED ON THE DEADLY. EXCAVATION VIOLATIONS OF AS SHIFTING FROM STRICT LIABILITY TO KNOWINGLY AND WILLFULLY. I REPEAT OFFENDERS ARE THE ONES WHO GET THE I BELIEVE THAT'S RIGHT BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THE BELIEVES THE COMMITTEE THAT THERE IS NOT AMBIGUITY HERE YEAH SO- YES THE EXCEPT THE MEMORIES ON PAGE SIX SEVEN COMING THROUGH THE ANALYSIS YES ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. I'M SORRY FOR INTERRUPTING MAY PROCEED- OKAY SO THIS WOULD A BILL WOULD CREATE THE CIVIL PENALTY FOR UP TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR AN OPERATOR. OR EXCAVATOR WHO AFTER FAILING TO FOLLOW THE DID ALERT REQUIREMENTS. DAMAGES A SUBSURFACE INSTALLATION AND CAUSES THE RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS GAS OR LIQUID. CURRENTLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO EXCAVATOR ON A SUB SERVICE INSTALLATION YOU'RE REQUIRED BY LAW TO CALL THE EIGHT ONE ONE NOTIFICATION CENTER. TO ENSURE YOU DON'T DAMAGE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE BURIED BENEATH THE SURFACE. THIS IS THE INFRASTRUCTURE- THAT COULD PROVIDE ENERGY WATER TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND SO ON. IT IS NO SMALL THING WHEN AN EXCAVATOR FAILS TO MAKE THIS CALL. DAMAGING SOMETHING'S BELOW THE SURFACE IS NOT ONLY COSTLY AND POTENTIALLY DISRUPTIVE. BUT CAN BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO THE WORKERS AND THE PUBLIC. THAT IS WHY THIS BILL IS. WHEN A SOLAR COMPANY FAILED TO CALL EIGHT ONE ONE AND DAMAGE TO GAS LINE. SOCALGAS EMPLOYEE WAIT KILL PATRICK AND HIS CREW WERE CALLED OUT TO FIX THE PROBLEM AND DURING THEIR WORK THE LEAKING GAS WAS IGNITED AND WEIGHED MISTER WADE WAS KILLED IN THE EXPLOSION. THIS TRAGEDY COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED HAD THE SOLAR COMPANY FOLLOWED THE LAW. MORE SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES WILL PUNISH THE BAD ACTORS AND PROVIDE SOME INCENTIVE FOR OTHERS TO SIMPLY CALL EIGHT ONE ONE.

SO SENTIMENT IF YOU'RE PREPARED TO GO AHEAD I THANK YOU CHAIR ON BERGEN THANK YOU TO COMMITTEE STAFF AND TO MY FELLOW MEMBERS. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU AS WELL TO SENATOR RUBIO I JOIN AUTHOR AND CENTER CABALLERO. WHO'S COLLECTING IS MEASURE. I'M PRESENTING SP THREE SEVENTY FOUR. WHICH AMENDS THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROTECTION ACT INCLUDE REPRODUCTIVE COERCION. WHICH CONSISTS OF CONTROL OVER THE REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY OF ANOTHER THROUGH THREAT OF FORCE OR INTIMIDATION. IN THE LAST YEAR WITH CODED WE'VE SEEN THE REPORTS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN CALIFORNIA RISES TO ALARMING LEVELS- MOST OF US WERE SHELTERING IN PLACE STAYING AT HOME BUT AS WE KNOW. HOME IS NOT A SAFE PLACE FOR MANY PEOPLE. THE ONGOING CERTAIN THE MYSTIC VIOLENCE REPORTS OF HIGHLIGHTED A CRITICAL NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR LOSS ACCURATELY REFLECT. AN ADDRESS THE VARIOUS FORMS OF ABUSE THAT THAT PEACE CAN TAKE. LAST YEAR MY COLLEAGUE IN THE JOINT AUTHORS THIS BILL SENATOR RUBIO EXPANDED THE DEFINITION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TO INCLUDE COERCIVE CONTROL. DEFINED AS DISTURBING THE PEACE OF ANOTHER PARTY. THIS BILL WOULD EXPAND ON THAT IMPORTANT MEASURE BY CLARIFYING THAT REPODUCTION REPRODUCTIVE COERCION IS A FORM OF COURSE OF CONTROL. HI MY WITNESSES CAN PROVIDE A MORE IN DEPTH EXPLANATION ON A HIGH LEVEL REPRODUCTIVE COERCION SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING. EXCESSIVELY PRESSURING SOMEONE TO GET PREGNANT- WITHDREW FOR CERTAIN TERMINATION DELIBERATELY INTO INTERFERING WITH CONTRACEPTION USE OR ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH INFORMATION OR USING OTHER COERCIVE TACTICS TO CONTROL OR TIME TO CONTROL PREGNANCY OUTCOMES. ALL THE TERM REPRODUCTIVE COERCION MAY BE UNFAMILIAR TO MANY PEOPLE THIS ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR IS UNFORTUNATELY ALL TOO COMMON FOR SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. A TWO THOUSAND TEN STUDY LOOKING AT FIVE FAMILY PLANNING CLINICS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. ON THE APPROXIMATELY 20% OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS AGES SIXTEEN TO TWENTY NINE SEEKING CARE THEIR- EXPERIENCE PREGNANCY COERCION. THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN STUDY OF FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY SEXUALLY ACTIVE HIGH SCHOOL FEMALES FOUND THAT NEARLY ONE IN EIGHT HAD EXPERIENCED REPRODUCTIVE COERCION IN THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS. AND LASTLY THE NATIONAL HOTLINE INVESTING VIOLENCE FOUND THAT 25% OF WOMEN. REPORTED THAT THEIR PARTNER OR EX PARTNER HAD TRIED TO FORCE OR PRESSURE THEM TO BECOME PREGNANT. REPRODUCTIVE COERCION IS ALL TOO COMMON AND DESPITE IS WIDESPREAD IMPACT REMAINS UNNAMED AND THEREFORE UNADDRESSED IN CALIFORNIA'S LAWS. TO ADDRESS THIS SB THREE SEVENTY FOUR PROVIDES NECESSARY CLARITY TO CALIFORNIA'S DEFINITION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BY ADDING REPRODUCTIVE COERCION TO THE ACT. PUTTING A NAME TO THIS HORRENDOUS ACT IS ONE PART OF THE SOLUTION AS IT WILL ENABLE AND HOW EMPOWER SURVIVORS IDENTIFY THE ABUSE THEY'VE EXPERIENCED. BUT THIS BILL ALSO HELP JUDGES WERE SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION IN ISSUING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS. ALLOWING THEM TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS CONDUCT IS LEGALLY DEFINED AS ABUSE. THIS CRITICAL ADDITION TO THE TVPA WILL HELP SURVIVORS SEEKING JUSTICE AND PROTECTION. SO I HAVE WITH ME HERE TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY- PROFESSOR DANCED OVER THE DIRECTOR OF UC IRVINE'S DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAW CLINIC AS WELL AS DOCTOR TAB AT THE PARK IN L. B. G. Y. AND TEACHING AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SENATOR MEN- IS PROFESSOR STOVER ONLINE. YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON CARE AND BRIDGING COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JAMES GALLAGHER AND I'D RECOMMEND PROVIDERS FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS IN A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE CORRESPOND FREDERATOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CLINIC.

EXEMPLIFIED HOPE YOU SURVIVE PERCENT DENIED PRODUCTIVE THANK YOU CAN HELP AND WHY DID CALIFORNIA CODE SECTION. SIXTY THREE TWENTY. THANK YOU. THANK PROFESSOR STORE FOR THOSE DON'T KNOW I MADE REFERENCE 2% PROFESSOR JUST OVER A LITTLE EARLIER PROFESSOR STOVER'S THE BETTER HALF OF THE MINCED OVER A UNION- NEXT WE HAVE. DR TAB WITH A HARKEN. DR HARKIN IF YOU'RE ONLINE. I AM THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M DOCTOR THOMAS OF HER CAN A PROFESSOR OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE. ACTIVE CORROSION AND SOMETHING THAT I'VE SEEN ON THE WEEKLY IF NOT DAILY BASIS FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS. WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IN A CLINICAL SETTING IS WOMEN ASKING FOR BIRTH CONTROL METHODS THAT THEIR PARTNERS CAN'T SEE OR KNOW ABOUT. AFTER THE DEPO-PROVERA SHOT A MEDICATION THAT'S INJECTED ONCE EVERY THREE MONTHS SO THAT OUR PARTNERS CAN'T THROW AWAY THEIR BIRTH CONTROL PILLS OR POKE HOLES IN CONDOMS. THE TYPICALLY ASK FOR THE HORMONE FREE INTRAUTERINE DEVICE THAT GIVES THEM HEAVIER MORE PAINFUL PERIODS DESPITE HAVING MULTIPLE OR OTHER LESS PAINFUL CHOICES. BECAUSE THEY STILL NEED TO HAVE A PERIOD OTHERWISE THEIR PARTNER WILL SUSPECT THAT THEY'RE USING A CONTRACEPTIVE AND HURT THEM OR BEAT THEM. THEY GET TESTED FREQUENTLY FOR SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY'RE MONOGAMOUS NOT HAVING SEX WITH ANYBODY ELSE. BECAUSE THEIR PARTNER HAD MULTIPLE OTHER PARTNERS BUT STILL REFUSES TO WEAR A CONDOM WITH SAM. ON DAYS WHEN WE PERFORM ABORTIONS THIS LOOKS LIKE PATIENTS WHO UNDERGO THE PROCEDURE WITHOUT PAIN MEDICATION. BECAUSE IF YOU WANT PAIN MEDICATION YOU NEED A DRIVER TO DRIVE YOU HOME. AND PARTNERS ARE OFTEN SO CONTROLLING THAT SEES PATIENTS HAVE NO FRIENDS OR FAMILY TO CALL. WHAT'S MORE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO APPEAR SLEEPIER ALTERED FOR MEDICATION WHEN THEIR PARTNERS COME HOME FOR FEAR OF AROUSING SUSPICION. DO THEY GO WITHOUT PAIN MEDICATION. WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE ON LABOR AND DELIVERY OUR PATIENTS WHO WANT TO STAY PREGNANT AND THEIR CURTAINS WANTS THEM TO TERMINATE. I HAD A PATIENT JUSTICE SUNDAY WHOSE PARTNER HAD BEATEN HER PREGNANT AFTER THEM TRYING TO INDUCE A MISCARRIAGE. IT DIDN'T WORK IT RARELY WORKS BUT THAT DOESN'T STOP IT FROM HAPPENING. THIS IS WHAT REPRODUCTIVE COERCION LOOKS LIKE ON A DAILY BASIS TO ME. AND I GUARANTEE THAT I ONLY SEE THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. IT NEEDS TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR WHAT IT IS AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL FORM OF CONTROL ENVIRONMENT. THANK YOU DR HARKIN- I SEE NO ONE IN THE GALLERY- TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT LET'S ROOM THIS MOVE TO ROOM ONE TWELVE I SEE KNOWN IN ROOM ONE TWELVE. MISTER MODERATOR.

HAS ALSO CALLED IN THE PROFESSOR YES- THANK YOU SENATE GONZALEZ. ARE CENTER BOARD IS YOUR MICROPHONE IS UP.

NOW I THINK- IS THAT BETTER THAT'S BETTER. ALL RIGHT. I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK THIS IS A VERY COMMENDABLE AND ALSO. REFLECTS THE REALITY. THAT THAT EXIST THERE IS THAT THERE CERTAINLY IS BECAUSE OF COURSE OF BEHAVIOR. AND AS IT PERTAINS TO REPRODUCTION- I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY BUT I WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT- BUT THERE'S- SOME COMMENTS- MADE BY THE AUTHOR OR MAYBE ONE OF HIS- SPONSORS OR HIS WITNESSES- INTIMIDATION IS. BOB IS IT LEGALLY DEFINED. PROFESSOR THAT'S A QUESTION TO LAURIE IT'S ABOUT THE QUESTION IF I MAY POSE IT THROUGH YOUTUBE- AUTHOR SURE- INSUBORDINATE OF OTHER QUESTIONS THEY WE CAN HAVE SENATOR MEN DRESS ALL WOMEN'S CLOTHES AREN'T WILL- SO THE QUESTION THEN I'LL PUT IT IN A FEW IS THAT IS THERE A LEGALLY DEFINED- DEFINITION FOR INTIMIDATION. A MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT COURTS ARE INSTRUCTED TO INTERPRET INTIMIDATION- BROADLY- AND IS THERE ANY A RESTRAINT OR- CLARIFICATION- THAT IS IN THIS BILL OR THAT YOU COULD SEE COULD BE INCORPORATING THIS BILL THAT REFINES WHAT INTIMIDATION IS YEAH BUT I'LL BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S CERTAINLY A WORTHWHILE BUILT UP ALL RIGHT- OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SINGLE POSADA CABALLERO. THANK YOU MADAM. MISTER CHAIR- ABOUT THE TO GET BACK FOR A THAT'S THAT CENTER THAT ALSO THAT'S FAIR- I JUST WANNA WANTED THANK THE WITNESSES THEIR TESTIMONY TODAY I'M I'M ALREADY A CO AUTHOR I BELIEVE IN THIS BILL I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. BUT I THOUGHT THAT THE TESTIMONY WAS TERRIFYING AND- I THINK IT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT IF PEOPLE KNEW WHAT WAS REALLY GOING ON IN THE MEDICAL FIELD AROUND THE INTIMIDATION AND THE FEAR AND- THE- ATTEMPT TO CONTROL THE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS HAVE. IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE IT WAS WOMEN- BUT I UNDERSTAND IT CAN BE EQUALLY APPLIED TO MEN I THINK THAT THE'D BE OUTRAGED AND SO I WANT I REALLY THINK THAT WITNESSES FOR PARTICIPATING TODAY AND FOR GIVING US. A SNAPSHOT OF WHAT THEY SEE IN THEIR EVERYDAY LIFE AS OUR MINISTERING TO THE HEALTH OF AND WELFARE OF WOMEN. AND SO I IDEA I WANT TO THANK- SENATOR MEN FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATE COVER YOUR EYES SO SEE IT MYSELF OF THE REMARKS ALL RIGHT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS SEEING NONE- CENTERMAN TO DO WANT TO ADDRESS US SENATOR BOARDS IS QUESTION YOUR CLOTHES I'M CONSTANTLY. AND IF THERE'S A MOTION FIRST. IS IT. CENTER CONSOLE MOVES AT I MAY REFER TO MY WITNESSES AS WELL- I I'D SAY THE ONE THING I NOTICED THAT INTIMIDATION HERE IS NOT IN THE CRIMINAL CODE SO IT'S IN THE FAMILY CODE I WOULD DEFER TO MY WITNESSES ON THE CASE LAW AND STATUTORY DEFINITION OF INTIMIDATION I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT SO WOULD THAT BE PROFESSOR STOVER- I THINK IT WOULD BE PROFESSORSHIP ALL RIGHT. MY BETTER HALF YEAH. IT IS DEFINED BY THE CHAIRS. ARE. I CAN'T DO IT SIGNIFICANT THAT WE PLACED EXPLAINS WHAT UNDER THE DEFINITION OF DISTURBING THE PEACE AND COLORS CONTROL I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SPECIFIC DEFINITION AT BALLOT THAT WOULD INTIMIDATION GOT COMPLETED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF DISTURBING THE PEACE AND COURAGE TO CONTROL. INDICATES LAW- TO WHICH COST WITH OUT TELLING AT DISTURBING PEACE IT'S THE CONTACT SPORT. THERE SIXTY THREE TWO. THREE IN JUST A UP ON THE CENTER- I'M HAPPY TO WITH YOU- IF YOU TO- WORK THIS ISSUE OUT IT IF THAT'S OF INTEREST AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS HERE BUT- I THINK THE POINT HERE IS TO TRY TO CAPTURE THE TYPES OF COERCION. THAT OCCUR IN THIS CONTEXT OF REPRODUCTIVE COERCION- THAT I WANT TO THANK- MR CARE AND MY FELLOW MEMBERS HERE- AS YOU FOR TODAY THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM IN THE FLICKS WHAT'S OF PEOPLE PARTICULARLY. WOMEN AND- THIS BILL BY NAMING AND DEFINING A PHENOMENON THAT UNFORTUNATELY HAPPENS ALL TOO OFTEN IT WILL ALLOW FOR THE SURVIVORS TO HAVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE IT WILL FACILITATE ACCESS TO JUSTICE ACCESS TO THE CRUCIAL PROTECTIONS THAT SAVE LIVES AND I BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL SAVE LIVES.

I WOULD BE GRATEFUL. ALL RIGHT. SENATE WIENER YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK YOU IN THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR- FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS- BILLS ARE SENATE BILL TWO TEN- PLACES COMMONSENSE PRIVACY REGULATIONS ON THE USAGE OF AUTOMATED LICENSE PLATE READERS KNOWN AS LPR SYSTEMS- BY PUBLIC AGENCIES INCLUDING A TWENTY FOUR HOUR LIMIT ON LPR DATA RETENTION- IF IT IF IT IS NOT RELEVANT. TO CRIMES OR VEHICLES OF INTEREST- AN ALE PR IS A CAMERA MOUNTED ON A TRAFFIC LIGHT ON A VEHICLE. OR OTHER LOCATIONS USED TO CAPTURE LICENSE PLATE INFORMATION. SOFTWARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ALE PR SYSTEM THAT EXTRACTS THE LICENSE PLATE NUMBER THE DATE TIME LOCATION AND POTENTIALLY OTHER- OFTEN SENSITIVE INFORMATION. FOR STORAGE IN A SEARCHABLE DATABASE. LPR SYSTEMS ARE USED BY A MAJORITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AROUND THE STATE AND GROWING WORK I THINK UP 270% NOW- AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE STATE AUDITOR AN AUDIT THAT I REQUESTED BACK IN TWENTY NINETEEN. BY TWENTY TWENTY THAT ALREADY CAME OUT AND IT SHOWED THAT L. P. R. IN- DATA IN CALIFORNIA IS THE WILD WEST ON I DON'T EXAGGERATE WHEN I SAY THAT- AGENCIES ARE ON FIRST OF ALL NOT EVEN MORE FREQUENTLY NOT COMPLAIN EVEN WITH EXISTING LAWCENTER HILL AUTHORED A BILL YEARS AGO TRUST. REQUIRES SOME BASIC POLICIES THERE ARE MAJOR JURISDICTIONS. OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THAT EXISTING LAW. A AND THEN WILL WE ARE SEEING- IS- AGENCIES WILL MAINTAIN MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF DATA IN PERPETUITY DID I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY KIND OF INVESTIGATION OR SUSPECT A CRIME- AND THEY'RE GIVING IT OUT LIKE CANDY- TO BASICALLY ANY AGENCY EVEN SOMETIMES GOT NON GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES. COM ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY. OF THE MILLIONS OF IMAGES CAPTURED AND STORED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES LESS THAN ONE PERCENT. BUT OFTEN LESS THAN A HALF A PERCENT BUT THESE PHOTOS MATCH ANY VEHICLE OF INTEREST OR RELATE TO ANY. CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE LAST TWO YEARS IN LOS ANGELES ALONE OF THE THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION IMAGES COLLECTED. ONLY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND GENERATED AHEAD IN TERMS OF A VEHICLE OF INTEREST- AND SO REGARDING THE OTHER THREE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILLION SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND- THEY SIMPLY MAINTAINED- THAT DATA. ONE LONG- THEREFORE COMPILED THESE MASSIVE DATABASES SOME TO OFTEN IN THE POSSESSION OF A PRIVATE COMPANY THAT. DOES WITH THE WHAT THEY WILL- THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION AND SOME WILL SAY THE OPPOSITION SAYS. IT'S JUST A PUBLIC PLACE WHERE YOUR CAR IS ON A PUBLIC PHOTOGRAPHS BUT THIS IS BASICALLY MASS SURVEILLANCE OF THIS INFORMATION CAN BE USED TO TRACK A PERSON DETERMINE THEIR DAILY PATTERNS. EXTRAPOLATE. THEIR SOCIAL CIRCLES AND SO FORTH. TIME DATA KEEPING OF THE TURNING MANY FACETS OF A PERSON'S LIFE. BITES AND SHIPPED OFF TO MANY DIFFERENT PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ENTITIES EVEN ICE. WHICH IS WITHIN A VIOLATION OF EXISTING LAW- THE ALSO THE INFORMATION STORED IS NOT ONLY- INCLUDE LICENSE PLATE NUMBERS- BALL DATE TIME AND LOCATION ARE OFTEN OF WHAT IS STORED SOME JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING SACRAMENTO AND LOS ANGELES ALSO INCLUDE THE PERSON'S NAME ADDRESSES DATE OF BIRTH AND EVEN CRIMINAL CHARGES IS ALL HELD IN THE POTENTIALLY IN PERPETUITY AND HE'S MASSIVE DATABASES FOR VEHICLES THAT ARE NOT OF INTEREST OR CONNECTED TO ANY CRIME. ON THE- THIS IS SENSITIVE DATA IS SHARED. WITH OTHER AGENCIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY EVEN PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE FRESNO IN MARIN BY SHARE THEIR LPR DATA WITH HUNDREDS OF ENTITIES- WITH SACRAMENTO SENDING THE DATA TO MORE THAN A THOUSAND DIFFERENT. ENTITIES. EVEN IF THE DATA ISN'T SHARED OUTSIDE THE AGENCY- OFFICERS EMPLOYEES OFTEN VERY LARGE ORGANS ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. HAVE ACCESS TO IT EVEN IF THERE'S NO CRIME AT ISSUE- THE CHP ALONE SAW ELEVEN CASES OF DATABASE YOU MUST USE INONE YEAR- IN THE CASE OF THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT THIRTEEN THOUSAND AGENCY PERSONNEL. HAVE ACCESS TO L. PUREDATA AT ANY GIVEN TIME. BY THE EXTENSIVE THIS OF THIS DATA MEANS THAT IF IT'S ACCESS TO RESEARCH IMPROPERLY THE THEATER COULD BE THE BASIS FOR BLACKMAIL HARASSMENT. OR THE TARGETING OF THOSE WHO ACCESS HEALTH CENTERS IMMIGRATION CENTERS WHO ATTEND PROTESTS OR OTHER SENSITIVE ACTIVITIES- SO- I WILL NOTE THAT- YOU DESPITE THE BROAD CLAIM BY LAW ENFORCEMENT THERE CAN BE A LIMIT ON RETAINER. THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL DOES HAVE RETENTION LIMIT WHICH IS SIXTY DAYS- WE ARE PROPOSING A MUCH SHORTER AND I WANT TO SAY THAT WERE IN CONVERSATION WITH CHP AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THERE'S NOTHING ABSOLUTELY MAGICAL ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND WE'RE OPEN TO WORKING. ON A DIFFERENT PERIOD OF TIME BUT THE FACT THAT CHP HAS- A RETENTION LIMIT- SHOWS THAT THIS IDEA THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO LIMIT. ARTIST REALLY HAS NO BASIS ON. FURTHER A MAJORITY OF THE CRIMES THAT ARE ENFORCERS SISTER WITH LPR OR TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS ARE AUTO THEFTS THESE ARE TYPICALLY NOT- YOU KNOW MORE SEVERE CRIMES THE COUNTY BUT THEY'RE TYPICALLY. NOT ON THE SUPREME COURT HAS REPEATEDLY HELD THAT WE HAVE AN EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY THE GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY BY SHOULD NOT AUTOMATICALLY BE TRACKING US EVERYWHERE WE GO AND WE DO HAVE A PRIVACY INTEREST. ON MUST STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN PUBLIC SAFETY AND PRIVACY IN THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO DO THAT. LPL SB TWO TEN DOES NOT STOP LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FROM USING LPR SYSTEMS OR DATA- BUT IT REQUIRES THAT IF YOU'RE NOT USING IT FOR AN ACTUAL CRIME YOU CAN'T KEEP IT FOREVER. YOU HAVE TO- ANNUALLY AUTO YOU'RE USED TO MAKE SURE THINGS ARE BEING DONE THE WAY THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE. BARCLAYS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I'LL GO.

LICENSE PLATE READERS ONLY GATHER LOCATION DATA AND IMAGES FROM VEHICLES LET ME OBSERVE FROM PUBLIC ROADWAYS. HOWEVER LIKE MOBILE PHONES IF YOU KNOW WHERE A VEHICLE IS BANNED YOU LIKELY KNOW WHERE THE OWNER OF THAT VEHICLE HAS BEEN. FOR CELL PHONES. ITS LOCATION. IT'S SO CLOSELY TIED WITH INDIVIDUALS LOCATION THAT THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DECIDED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. BUT A WARRANT WAS REQUIRED FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ACCESS. CELLPHONE LOCATION INFORMATION. THE INCREASING PREVALENCE LICENSE READERS THE ASSOCIATE BETWEEN OF. LOCATION AND THE LOCATION OF THE OWNER ARE BECOMING MORE TOGETHER AS WELL.

LIMITED TO HOW LONG RETAIN DATA COLLECTED BY LICENSE READERS. OTHER ON PERSONALLY. IN CALIFORNIA HAVE WRITTEN LICENSE. READER DATA FOR. YEARS AND INDEFINITELY. SOME AGENCIES SIMPLY USE THE VENDOR DEFAULT WHICH IN ONE CASE WAS SIX YEARS. HOW DO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES DECIDE HOW LONG TO RETAIN LICENSE PLATE READER DATA.

NONE OF THE TIME PERIOD FOR WHICH LEGALLY METER IS RETAINED WANT NEEDS IS BAY ON A NOW OF IS USE. WAIT AGAINST CIVIL CAN. IN FACT THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR TWENTY NINE CONCLUDED THAT QUOTE AGENCIES MAY BE RETAINING THE IMAGES LONGER THAN. AND THUS INCREASING THE RISK INDIVIDUALS PRIVACY.

IF YOU'RE A SMALLER AGENCY YOU'RE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE THE RESOURCES AND WE JUST WANT TO MAKE IT. LIKE OUT OF THE BOX EASY. FOR JURISDICTIONS OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SAYS THAT THIS IS A MODEL POLICY- AND SO WE'RE JUST GONNA. ADOPTED AND FRANKLY. THANK YOU VISIT OUR INTEREST TO HAVE SOME CONSISTENCY. SO THAT THAT'S THE PURPOSE- THE PURPOSE OF BAD TO HAVE YOU KNOW TO THAT HIGH QUALITY EXAMPLE OF WHAT A CITY CAN DO. OKAY IT IS SORT OF FULFILLING THE DESIRE OF THE HILL BILL A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. YEAH THERE WAS THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DEVELOP THESE REASONABLE LOOKS. MORE PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS WERE NOT SURE EVERYBODY'S DONE IT YET SO- IF I MAY SO A VISITOR. SURE YES- TO BY SENATOR HILL BACK IN A FEW TWENTY FOURTEEN OR THEREABOUTS WHAT WOULD CAUSE A BIT ISSUE FOR A WHILE AND IT'S BEEN GROWING OVER TIME AND IT'S GROWN INS DRAMATIC IN LAST FIVE YEARS. LIKE EVERYONE WANTS IN ON US AND SO CENTER HILL DID THE WISE THING AND SAID OKAY THIS IS STARTED TO ACCELERATE LET'S TAKE A LIGHTER TOUCH TIME TO TELL THEM THEY ALL HAVE TO HAVE POLICIES IN PLACE. TO HAVE TO DISCLOSE ETCETERA ETCETERA- WATER AL ACCORDING THE AUDITOR THAN A LOT OF THESE AGENCIES THE NUMBER OF INCLUDING SOME BIG ONES JUST IGNORE THAT ENTIRELY. ON AND THAT THE ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR TO SIX CELEBRATED SO. WE STARTED OUT WITH A LIGHTER TOUCH DOWN WE AUDITED AUDITED OUGHTA AND FOUND SOME HORRIFYING THINGS. AS OF NOW WE'RE HAVING TO TAKE THE NEXT. THE NEXT UP. WE WANTED TO DO THIS LAST YEAR OLD SENATOR HELLO STILL HERE- BUT HE- BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO DROP A LOT OF BILLS LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF CODE YEAH. THERE'S A LOT MISTER CHAIR THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD THINGS IN THE BILL I DON'T WANNA GET BOGGED DOWN ON THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS BUT SOME OF THE BRING EVERYBODY. UP TO SPEED ON ON BEST PRACTICES I THINK IS IMPORTANT STEP. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATE WHAT CASKEY- CENTER THROSSELL. MISTER CHAIRMAN- I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL- I'M DISTURBED BY THE LACK OF PROTOCOLS IN THE OUTSOURCING OF THIS VERY SENSITIVE MATERIAL TO PRIVATE COMPANIES I THINK THAT'S THE ESPECIALLY WHAT- BOTHERS ME I DO UNDERSTAND THAT A LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS TOOLS AND WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY OF. ALLOWING THEM TO GET. SOME INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED- BUT- THE WAY THIS IS IMPACTING. ON INNOCENT PEOPLE I THINK ARE NEEDS TO BE. RE DONE IT IS ALSO REALLY DISTURBING TO LEARN THAT MANY OF OUR LONG LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE SHARING THIS DATA WITH ICE. R. AS ALSO REVEALED BY THEM THE STATE AUDIT- SO I AM- I LIKE THE PROVISION AND- IN THIS BILL REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE- TO PROVIDE THIS POLICY- TEMPLATE- AND TO ISSUE GUIDANCE SO. I HOPE THAT- THIS IS ALL FIXED SO THAT ON. THE PROPER INFORMATION CAN BE USED IN THE PROPER WAY THANK. RESIDENTS ALSO CENTER BOARD STAGE IS YOUR MICROPHONE UP. SORRY. THANK YOU. THERE'S A LOT OF MEDIA COMPONENTS TO THIS AND- I KNOW WE'VE DEALT WITH PRIVACY AND SO MANY DIFFERENT CAPACITIES AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE A HYDRO WHICH KEEP ON FINDING MORE MORE- THINGS TO DISCUSS AND LEARN ABOUT AND MOVE FORWARD ON- I THINK. THE COMMENTS ON THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR RULE HAVE MERIT. BUT I WANTED TO JUST COME HERE FROM THE AUTHOR- BECAUSE HE'S A VERY THOUGHTFUL- LEGISLATOR ON THE ON THESE ISSUES. THE AUDITOR'S REPORT IF I MAY THROUGH THE CHAIR- THE AUDITOR'S REPORT THAT THERE WAS NON COMPLIANCE SERIAL NON COMPLIANCE WITH SOME OF THESE DIFFERENT MUNICIPALITIES IN DIFFERENT DIVISIONS AND SO ON SO FORTH. WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT'S A SITUATION WHERE- A COMPLIANCE INCENTIVE OR MANDATE WOULD YIELD THE RESULT THAT YOU WANT. THAT ALLOWS FOR THIS INFORMATION TO BE COLLECTED FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES- BECAUSE THAT CERTAINLY HAS HAS MERIT. IN THE TIME LINE WITHIN WHICH THAT INFORMATION BE STORED. AND DISCLOSED TO THIRD PARTIES ASSUMING THAT THERE ARE CONFIDENTIALITY PROTOCOLS IN PLACE SUCH THAT IF A FINE WERE IN PLACE. WOULD THAT NOT RESOLVE. ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES HERE. HI YES SO- EVENTS OF QUESTION CORRECTLY- TWO THINGS WE LEARNED TWO THINGS FROM THE AUDIT WE LEARNED THAT- ASPECTS OF THE INDUSTRY THIRTY FOUR I THINK IT WAS OBSERVE THE CENTER HELD BILL- WERE NOT BEING COMPLIED WITH BUT WE ALSO LEARNED THAT THE ISSUES GO BEYOND WHAT THAT BILL. I'VE DEALT WITH SAID THAT THE REALLY DRAMATIC INCREASE USE OF LPR BY MORE MORE AGENCIES AND LEARNING MORE ABOUT HOW THE DATA WAS BEING USER FRIENDLY MISUSED- SHOWED US THAT WE NEED TO BUILD UPON THE WORK OF IN ADDITION TO GETTING COMPLIANCE BUT ACTUALLY BUILDING ON IT. AND IT'S QUITE LIMITED WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT THIS IS NOT A KITCHEN SINK BILL REQUIRING. THE W. RETURNS PERIOD LIKE I SAID FLEXIBLE AND FOR FOUR HOUR AND WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH. ON THAT. AND THEN YOU KNOW AUDITING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S BEEN COMPLY BECAUSE THE AUDIT PART WHICH IS RECOMMENDED BY THE ORDER. GIVEN THAT WE SAW SO MUCH NON COMPLIANCE BEFORE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS AN ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM AND THEN REQUIRING. OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO HELP CITIES COMPLY WITH TEMPLATES. SO WE THINK IT'S A PRETTY- MEASURED RESPONSE. TO WHAT'S INCREASINGLY- REALLY PROBLEMATIC SITUATION TRUMP VERY TROUBLING. THAT AGENCIES ARE DOING US. IN THAT'S IN ANYTHING YOU CAN HEAR MY CONCERN- ON THIS ISSUE IS. INTUITIVELY I WOULD THINK THAT THERE WOULD BE WAYS- WE'RE PRIVACY COULD BE PROTECTED TO SOME DEGREE LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERESTS. HE LOOKED AFTER TO SOME DEGREE- THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR RULE I THINK IF WE JUST FROM MY FROM MY STANDPOINT. I KNOW YOU'RE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT I HOPE YOU DO- IT. IN IN IN REAL LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES NOT ALWAYS DOES IT MOVE THAT QUICKLY IN TERMS OF INVESTIGATION. AND I'D IN REFINEMENT OF FOLKS. TO LOOK AFTER OR PERSONS OF INTEREST. THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT OF A CHALLENGE IN FACT. IF CHP'S DOING IT FOR SIXTY DAYS- I THINK SOMETHING LIKE THAT COULD BE COULD BE HELPFUL OR SOME. SOME TIME PERIOD LIKE THAT. AND A FINANCIAL PENALTY OR SOME SORT OF REGULATORY PENALTY FOR. THE DISCLOSURE OF THIS INFORMATION FOR UNINTENDED PURPOSES. THAT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT TO ME. IF IT IS INDEED GOING TO THIRD PARTIES- THAT DO NOT HAVE THE AUTHORIZATION TO USE THAT- I KNOW I KNOW THIS SEEMS TO BE A WORK IN PROGRESS IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE MODIFIED IS. IS TIMELY TIMES GO ON BUT IF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER- I'M I'M HOPEFUL THAT YOU THAT YOU WOULD. TAKE TAKE A GANDER AT SOME OF THESE SOME OF THESE. POINTS ON BECAUSE THERE'S A BALANCE. RIGHT NOW I THINK IT'S IN BAD BY MAYBE A SOME POINT AT LEAST IN MY- IT COULD BE A BALANCE BETWEEN PRIVACY AND- THE EFFICACY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL. THANK YOU SIR BORDERS OTHER QUESTIONS. SAYING NONE OF THE SENATE CABALLERO. THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANNA- THERE IT DID THIS IS BEEN BROUGHT UP IN TERMS OF WORKING WITH THE POLICE AGENCIES I THINK THE HIGHWAY PATROL SAID SIXTY DAYS BUT I THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND I. I INTEND TO SUPPORT THE BILL- THE FACT THAT THI LEGISLATION HAS BEEN IN EFFECT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND NOTHING'S BEEN DONE TO- PROTECT- THAT THEDATA IS BEING COLLECTED IS REALLY OF CONCERN AND SO- I WANT ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO WORK WITH THE POLICE AGENCY THAT I DON'T THINK A- THAT TIME HEARD IN LISTED IN THE BILL IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME BUT I TRUST THAT THAT THE AUTHOR WILL WILL WORK WITH THEM. THANK YOU CYNICAL HERE. ANYONE ELSE I ASSUME GONZALEZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- YOU TO SENATOR WIENER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I JUST HAD A THOUGHT AND- I KNOW THAT THE AUDITOR HAD INCLUDED- ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE I THINK- SHE HAD RECOMMENDED C. JUST COMPLIANCE WHICH MOST- LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WOULD HAVE TO DO WITH. CERTAIN TYPES OF DATA BUT SINCE W'RE- REINVENTING WHAT L. A. L. P. R. DATA WHERE THEY CAN WORK CAN GO. MY CONCERN IS THAT THERE ARE FEW AGENCIES NOW THAT ARE CURRENTLY- COMPLYING WITH SIEGES. BUT THAT WOULD ASSUME COMPLIANCE WITH IN IN COLLABORATION WITH THE FBI. SO THAT IS CONCERNING TO ME- AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING. THIS IS FOR A LATER DISCUSSION THOUGH AS YOUR YOU KNOW INVOLVING THE BILL IS. IF THIS DATA WOULD STILL HAVE TO. UP IF IT WOULD STILL COMPLY OR WOULD IT STILL BE NECESSARY FOR IT TO COMPLY WITH SIEGES THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE INFORMATION SYSTEM. DATA ARM WE WILL LET ME SEE IF I COULD CIRCLE BACK WITH YOU ON THAT I JUST CAN'T RECALL AFFECTS MANDATED UNDER FEDERAL LAW OR NOT- WE ACTUALLY DON'T WANT THEM TO BE SHARING WITH FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AT ALL- AND WE THINK THAT ACTUALLY UNDER CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW WE DON'T THINK THEY'RE ALLOWED. TO DO THAT RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE MOST FOCUS ON ICE- BUT WE'LL GO BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT AT THE FBI- AS WELL YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL WOULD LIKE YEAH WOULD BE GREAT TO CLARIFY THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WILL GIVE NOT HAVE YOUR OWN HOUSE THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATORS ALSO OTHERS- AND I NOTED SENATOR STERN IS PRESENT REMOTELY A SENATOR STERN WE'RE GOING TO COME TO YOU IF YOU WOULD LET US KNOW WHO- THE STAFF PERSON THIS IS IN YOUR OFFICE. AND JUST DIRECTOR. WELLS BE WITH YOU MISTER CHAIR ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SENATOR STERN- I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A QUESTION OR COMMENT- AS A REMINDER IT WOULD BE. USEFUL IF. WHEN YOU'RE NOT SPEAK IF YOU JUST PUT A SOME YOU DON'T THINK YOU HAVE BUT JUST AS A REMINDER. SO THANK YOU SENATOR STERN CLOSURES. I'M I DON'T WANT TO. BE LABOR ANY POINTS OR PARTY MADE AT THEIR EXCELLENT BILLS MUCH NEEDED. SOME AGREE JUST. A OVERREACH HERE CURIOUS WHAT SORT OF RECOURSE THERE WILL BE UNDER EXISTING LAW ALSO FOR- UNDERSEA CPA OR UNDER THE HILLDALE RENDER PROP TWENTY FOUR FOUR- VIGILANT. TYPE SYSTEMS EVEN IF THEY VIOLATE THEIR CONTRACTS POTENTIALLY WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL KIND OF. SEVERAL ABILITY THERE MIGHT BE AS WELL BUT I JUST WANTED. TO SEE. IF THE AUTHORS- AT ALL. INTERESTED IN SHARING. SOME OF HIS THINKING ABOUT. HOW HOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT THAT TWENTY FOUR HOUR PROVISION IS IT IS IT REALLY ABOUT PERK INCIDENT BECAUSE THIS IT SEEMS LIKE THE GENERAL HOTLIST IS THIS AREA THAT. THAT FOLKS WANT TO BE ABLE TO. YOU KNOW HOW HAVE SOME KIND OF CROSS REFERENCE ON IT IS IT IS IT MORE THE POLICY ISSUE AROUND. HAVING THAT HOT LIST BE TO CROSS REFERENCE FOR TOO LONG OR IS IT MORE THE POLICY ISSUE OF- AND CIRCLE OF THE TIMING OF INDIVIDUAL INVESTIGATION. RON AND YOU CAN COUNT ON YOUR CLOTHES TOO I JUST I WANT TO I WAS JUST HOPING TO DIG DEEPER INTO THAT TENSION BETWEEN. THE BILLS- TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD AND THEN THE SORT OF STANDARD PROTOCOLS LIKE. WHAT ARE THE WHAT IFS POLICY ARGUMENTS FOR. AND BIG DIFFERENCE HERE IT'S TIME. NO I CAN ANSWER THAT NOW- SO I MEAN I THINK OUR JOB THE REASON WHAT WITH THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND AS I MENTIONED WE'RE REFLECTS UPON IT AND THEN- OVER GOING TO KEEP WORKING ON THAT IS THAT WE THINK THAT THAT IS A TOUGH TIME IT'S A VERY FAST PROCESS THAT THEY- GET THOSE DATA. IT'S UPLOADED. AND THEN EITHER MATCHES WITH A CAR THAT'S ON THE HOLLISTER NOT. REGARD CARDS BEEN STOLEN- SPOTTED IN CONNECTION WITH A CRIME. AND IF IT'S NOT THEN I THINK HE WAS. WHY ARE YOU KEEPING THAT DATA- SOUL AND THE SAN LAW ENFORCEMENT IS SAYING WE WANT TO KEEP IT FOR. I MEAN. A LOT OF LAW ENFORCERS SAYING WE WANT TO KEEP IT FOREVER AND DON'T TELL US WHAT TO DO AND WE WANT TO GIVE IT OUT TO EVERYONE IN THE SUN. WE CAN DO THAT OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT GONNA GROUP THAT. BUT AT LEAST AND I WANT TO KEEP YOU KNOW. EVEN THOUGH WE'RE WE'RE NOT FULLY ALIGNED WITH THE SIXTY DAYS. ON A COMMAND THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL WITHOUT BEING TOLD TO DO SO. FOR DOING THE RESPONSIBLE THING- AND IMPLEMENTING- A LIMITATION THAT THAT'S COMMENDABLE I REALLY WANT TO COMMEND. YOU FOR DOING THAT-% AND WE WILL. BE ENGAGING HAVING A MORE IN DEPTH DISCUSSIONS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO REALLY FIGURE OUT. WHAT IS THE RIGHT PERIOD OF TIME. IN TERMS OF THAT SORT OF MORE WE'RE LOOKING- SITUATION. AGAIN WE THOUGHT TWENTY FOUR HOURS A PROPOSED EITHER ON THE HOT LIST ABOUT POINT OR NOT. IF THERE ARE YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE WE'RE OPEN TO. YOU KNOW A FACT BASED DISCUSSION OF WHY THEY WOULD NEED X. AMOUNT. OF TIME ON SO THAT THAT'S THAT'S SORT OF A GENERAL. FUND. ABOUT THAT ISSUE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR WIENER QUESTION COMMENTS. SEEING NO- IS OUR MOTION.
