ABOUT. CONDITIONING SERVICE

00:08:51.097 --> 00:08:53.099
MEMBERS AS WELL AS VETERANS AS

00:08:53.165 --> 00:08:54.967
WELL AND ANY TO ANY POLICY THAT

00:08:55.034 --> 00:08:56.335
BENEFITS MILITARY SPOUSES IS

00:08:56.402 --> 00:08:58.537
GOING TO BENEFIT THOSE THOSE

00:08:58.604 --> 00:09:01.274
POPULATIONS AS WELL. MY

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.242
PARTICULAR FOCUS ON MILITARY

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:04.644
SPOUSES IS JUST ACKNOWLEDGING

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.079
THE- FREQUENT TRANSITION THAT

00:09:07.146 --> 00:09:09.782
THEY AN INDOOR AND THAT IT IS

00:09:09.849 --> 00:09:12.551
THIS REPETITIVE DESTRUCTION OF

00:09:12.618 --> 00:09:14.287
THEIR CAREER THAT HAS THE

00:09:14.353 --> 00:09:16.756
IMPACT ON. THEIR CAR CAREER

00:09:16.822 --> 00:09:18.357
SISTINE ABILITY ATTAINMENT AND

00:09:18.424 --> 00:09:20.026
ALSO THEIR FAMILY'S FINANCIAL

00:09:20.092 --> 00:09:21.627
STABILITY SO IT BECAUSE OF

00:09:21.694 --> 00:09:22.962
THOSE REASONS THAT'S JUST OUR

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:25.364
FOCUS RIGHT NOW BUT AGAIN

00:09:25.431 --> 00:09:25.965
ANYTHING WE DO CAN BE APPLIED

00:09:26.032 --> 00:09:28.534
ACROSS THE BOARD. AND WE

00:09:28.601 --> 00:09:30.069
DEFINITELY THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:09:30.136 --> 00:09:32.271
TO HIGHLIGHT AND ADDRESS THE

00:09:32.338 --> 00:09:33.673
NEEDS OF VETERANS AND

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:34.273
TRANSITIONING SERVICE MEMBERS

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.444
AS WELL. SO MILITARY SPELLS

00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:40.313
MOBILITY IS NOT A CHOICE HAVING

00:09:40.379 --> 00:09:42.081
PUTTING THAT UP FRONT IT YOU

00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:43.349
SOME MIGHT THINK THAT IT'S A

00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:44.951
CHOICE BUT IT'S NOT A VIABLE

00:09:45.017 --> 00:09:48.120
CHOICE FOR FAMILIES SO WE KNOW

00:09:48.187 --> 00:09:49.855
THAT WHEN I'M- CIVILIAN

00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:51.524
COUNTERPARTS IN SIMILAR

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:54.260
SITUATION AS MILITARY SPOUSES.

00:09:54.327 --> 00:09:55.795
REALIZE THE DIFFICULTY THAT

00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:59.065
MIGHT INCUR FROM THE MOVE THEY

00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:00.399
MIGHT HAVE THE OPTION TO CHOOSE

00:10:00.466 --> 00:10:02.001
NOT TO MOVE WHERE MILITARY

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:03.769
SPOUSE THERE'S TWO OPTIONS THEY

00:10:03.836 --> 00:10:05.905
CAN CHOOSE NOT TO MOVE AND

00:10:05.972 --> 00:10:08.941
DISRUPT THEIR ENTIRE FAMILY OR

00:10:09.008 --> 00:10:13.446
THEY CAN NOT THEY CAN CHOOSE

00:10:13.512 --> 00:10:14.046
NOT TO PURSUE THEIR LICENSE IN

00:10:14.113 --> 00:10:17.049
THAT STATE. IS OBVIOUSLY STILL

00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:17.650
CREATING A DISTRACTION FOR THE

00:10:17.717 --> 00:10:19.118
FAMILY AS FAR AS ECONOMICS. SO

00:10:19.185 --> 00:10:19.986
IT'S NOT A CHOICE IT'S A IT'S A

00:10:20.052 --> 00:10:21.053
IT'S A LOSING PROPOSITION FOR

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.789
MILITARY SPOUSES IN TERMS OF

00:10:23.856 --> 00:10:25.791
MOBILITY AND MOBILITY IS GOT IS

00:10:25.858 --> 00:10:27.760
DIRECTED BY THEIR SPOUSE THEIR

00:10:27.827 --> 00:10:29.795
ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBER OR

00:10:29.862 --> 00:10:31.430
RESERVE AND THEY'RE ACTING

00:10:31.497 --> 00:10:34.834
THERE'D SERVICE MEMBERS COMMAND

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.869
AND MISSION REQUIREMENTS.

00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:38.170
MILITARY SPOUSES ARE HIGHLY

00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:40.473
SKILLED AND HIGHLY EDUCATED I

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:43.075
WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT. BUT

00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:48.247
SEE. 32% AND THEY'RE ALL OF THE

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:49.315
NUMBERS ACROSS THE BORDER

00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:51.183
HIGHER THAN THEIR AVERAGE BUT

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.320
32% OF MILITARY SPOUSES HAVE A

00:10:54.387 --> 00:10:55.721
GRADUATE OR PROFESSIONAL DEGREE

00:10:55.788 --> 00:10:58.824
VERSES 12% FOR THE CAT

00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:01.327
COUNTERPARTS IN CALIFORNIA SO

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:02.094
WITH THESE THESE ARE HIGH I

00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:03.195
REALLY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT YOU

00:11:03.262 --> 00:11:05.197
KNOW AND YOU THERE ACROSS THE

00:11:05.264 --> 00:11:06.098
BOARD YOU HAVE YOUR SPOUSE'S IN

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:09.168
EVERY INDUSTRY BUT BUT AS FAR

00:11:09.235 --> 00:11:11.904
AS I'M KIND OF BREAKING SOME

00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:13.773
STEREO TYPES ABOUT MILITARY

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:16.475
SPOUSES BEING YOUNG AROUND

00:11:16.542 --> 00:11:17.009
EDUCATED THEY'RE- THEY'RE

00:11:17.076 --> 00:11:19.512
HIGHLY EDUCATED. AND THERE IS A

00:11:19.578 --> 00:11:23.416
HUGE ASSET TO THE STATE. I

00:11:23.482 --> 00:11:25.217
THEY'RE ALSO SO SPELL SO CAREER

00:11:25.284 --> 00:11:26.419
SATISFACTION AND FAMILY

00:11:26.485 --> 00:11:27.720
ECONOMIC SECURITY AFFECTS

00:11:27.787 --> 00:11:29.221
MILITARY RETENTION THAT SAID

00:11:29.288 --> 00:11:30.656
IT'S A KEY THEME THAT WE'VE

00:11:30.723 --> 00:11:32.825
BEEN TALKING ABOUT A LOT AND

00:11:32.892 --> 00:11:36.495
YOU'LL HEAR IT FROM OTHERS BUT

00:11:36.562 --> 00:11:38.297
60% OF MARRIED SERVICE MEMBERS

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:39.532
HAVE REPORTED THAT THEIR

00:11:39.598 --> 00:11:40.633
SPOUSES ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A

00:11:40.699 --> 00:11:42.301
CAREER IMPACTS THEIR DOES

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:43.436
DECISION TO STAY IN THE

00:11:43.502 --> 00:11:45.671
MILITARY BY A LARGE OR MODERATE

00:11:45.738 --> 00:11:49.875
EXTENT IN ADDITION 77% OF

00:11:49.942 --> 00:11:51.677
MILITARY SPOUSES HAVE INDICATED

00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:54.346
THAT THE ON IN A SURVEY THAT

00:11:54.413 --> 00:11:56.749
THEY EITHER WANTED OR NEEDED TO

00:11:56.816 --> 00:11:58.851
WORKS OF SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT.

00:11:58.918 --> 00:12:00.419
AND WHEN WE GO INTO THE

00:12:00.486 --> 00:12:01.187
DEMOGRAPHICS YOU'LL SEE THE

00:12:01.253 --> 00:12:02.421
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT THAT

00:12:02.488 --> 00:12:04.423
THAT THAT WANTING OR NEEDING TO

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:05.891
WORK IN IN THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF

00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.993
THOSE WORKING AND WE THINK THAT

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.462
LICENSURE BARRIERS ARE PART OF

00:12:09.528 --> 00:12:11.263
THAT PART OF THAT KIND OF

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:17.203
EQUATION. FINALLY MILITARY

00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.837
SPOUSE LICENSING IN EMPLOYMENT

00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:19.105
IS OF ECONOMICS ITS IMPORTANCE

00:12:19.171 --> 00:12:20.439
TO STATES PRIMARILY FROM THE

00:12:20.506 --> 00:12:22.475
STANDPOINT OF SUSTAINING

00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:23.275
MILITARY INSTALLATIONS AND THE

00:12:23.342 --> 00:12:25.244
THREE SERVICE SECRETARIAT.

00:12:25.311 --> 00:12:27.413
RECENTLY LAST YEAR PUT OUT A

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.681
LETTER SENT A LETTER TO THE

00:12:28.747 --> 00:12:30.082
NATIONAL GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION

00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:31.784
IS STATING THAT K. TWELVE

00:12:31.851 --> 00:12:34.286
EDUCATION AND MILITARY SPOUSE

00:12:34.353 --> 00:12:37.089
EMPLOYMENT. AND LICENSURE WOULD

00:12:37.156 --> 00:12:38.991
BE ONE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS

00:12:39.058 --> 00:12:39.959
WHEN LOOKING AT BASING

00:12:40.025 --> 00:12:42.061
DECISIONS THAT LETTER IT SHOULD

00:12:42.128 --> 00:12:44.530
BE AND YOUR PACKETS AND IT'S IN

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:45.865
THE IT'S ALSO AND CONTAINED IN

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:49.668
THE- SENATE ARMS SERVICES

00:12:49.735 --> 00:12:50.269
COMMITTEE REPORT FROM MARCH OF

00:12:50.336 --> 00:12:56.041
THIS YEAR. ALRIGHT SO IS FAR AS

00:12:56.108 --> 00:12:57.910
DEMOGRAPHICS I'M NOT GOING TO

00:12:57.977 --> 00:12:58.544
GO THROUGH ALL THIS I DID WANT

00:12:58.611 --> 00:12:59.411
TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF KEY

00:12:59.478 --> 00:13:00.946
POINTS THE NUMBER ONE KEY POINT

00:13:01.013 --> 00:13:04.350
IS THAT. MILITARY SPOUSES ARE

00:13:04.416 --> 00:13:06.018
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY

00:13:06.085 --> 00:13:08.921
LICENSE LICENSING BARRIERS. SO

00:13:08.988 --> 00:13:10.389
YOU CAN SEE I DON'T BECAUSE HAS

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:13.792
A POINT OR DOES IT. OKAY I'M

00:13:13.859 --> 00:13:18.297
I'M I'M NOT GONNA CHECK. OKAY

00:13:18.364 --> 00:13:21.400
SO IF YOU LOOK DOWN BUT SEE THE

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:24.370
PART I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT WAS

00:13:24.436 --> 00:13:26.238
SO CALIFORNIA ACTIVE DUTY

CALIFORNIA OF THAT NUMBER FORTY

00:13:37.983 --> 00:13:39.084
SIX OVER FORTY SIX THOUSAND OR

00:13:39.151 --> 00:13:41.654

FORCE. AND THEN THE POINT I

00:13:48.627 --> 00:13:50.362
REALLY WANTED TO DRIVE DOWN WAS

00:13:50.429 --> 00:13:53.432
THE NEXT ONE SO THOSE MILITARY

WORKED HARD THESE LAST FEW

00:17:39.057 --> 00:17:41.527
YEARS OUR LAST DECADE I GUESS.

YOU KNOW TRYING TO MAKE ENTRY

00:17:43.228 --> 00:17:44.863
INCREMENTAL CHANGE AND TO

REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND

00:17:47.466 --> 00:17:49.468
THE ONLY I'M KIND OF TAKE AWAY

00:17:49.535 --> 00:17:51.370
I HAVE IS KIND OF TWO POINTS

00:17:51.437 --> 00:17:53.305
ONE IS YOU KNOW WE DEFINITELY

00:17:53.372 --> 00:17:54.006
ARE APPRECIATIVE OF

00:17:54.072 --> 00:17:57.376
CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS. TO IS IN

00:17:57.443 --> 00:17:58.777
SPITE OF ALL OF THIS JUST AS IN

00:17:58.844 --> 00:18:02.014
THE PREVIOUS SLIDE WHERE WE DID

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:02.581
PASS ALL THOSE BILLS ACROSS

00:18:02.648 --> 00:18:06.418
THEY GET. OR CONTRIBUTE TO

00:18:06.485 --> 00:18:07.052
THOSE BILLS BEING PASSED ACROSS

00:18:07.119 --> 00:18:10.389
THE UNITED STATES. WE STILL

00:18:10.456 --> 00:18:12.324
HAVE. AN ISSUE SO IN TWO

00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:12.858
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE WERE

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:15.594
STILL HEARING. EVEN AFTER ALL

00:18:15.661 --> 00:18:16.862
THESE BILLS IN ALL THE STATES

00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:18.430
WE ARE STILL HEARING FEEDBACK

00:18:18.497 --> 00:18:19.665
FROM SPOUSES THAT THEY WERE

00:18:19.731 --> 00:18:21.166
STILL EXPERIENCING MAJOR

00:18:21.233 --> 00:18:22.768
CHALLENGES AND LICENSING AND SO

00:18:22.835 --> 00:18:24.803
WE WONDERED YOU KNOW WE DID ALL

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:25.637
THIS WORK THE STATE'S DID ALL

00:18:25.704 --> 00:18:26.839
THIS WORK WHAT WHAT'S THE

00:18:26.905 --> 00:18:29.041
PROBLEM. AND SO WE DID IT WE

00:18:29.107 --> 00:18:31.376
CHARTERED AS A STUDY WITH THE

00:18:31.443 --> 00:18:34.513
UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. IN ALL

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.482
FIFTY STATES AND SIX WE

00:18:36.548 --> 00:18:38.250
SELECTED SIX AREAS AS A

00:18:38.317 --> 00:18:40.719
SNAPSHOT IN THOSE AREAS ARE

00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:43.155
COMMONLY THEY'RE NOT NOT ALL OF

00:18:43.222 --> 00:18:47.926
THEM ARE THE TOP OCCUPATIONS.

00:18:47.993 --> 00:18:48.527
BUT A LOT OF THESE OCCUPATIONS

00:18:48.594 --> 00:18:53.532
ARE COMMONLY. I GUESS IT YET

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:55.834
UTILIZED BY MILITARY SPOUSES.

00:18:55.901 --> 00:18:57.102
SO I WE FOUND THAT FORTY TWO

00:18:57.169 --> 00:18:58.136
STATES WERE PROVIDING TEMPORARY

00:18:58.203 --> 00:18:59.471
LICENSING THIRTY NINE WERE

00:18:59.538 --> 00:19:00.072
MAKING ENDORSEMENT OF EXISTING

00:19:00.138 --> 00:19:02.074
LIGHT LE LICENSES AVAILABLE AND

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.408
THIRTY ONE WERE X. EXPEDITING

00:19:03.475 --> 00:19:05.043
THE PROCESS AND I THAT'S A

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:06.078
MISTAKE THERE'S ACTUALLY THEY

00:19:06.144 --> 00:19:07.379
WERE NOT EXPEDITING THE PROCESS

00:19:07.446 --> 00:19:08.881
OF GETTING A LICENSE EXPEDITING

00:19:08.947 --> 00:19:11.316
THE PROCESS OF APPLYING FOR A

00:19:11.383 --> 00:19:15.020
LICENSE IS WHAT THAT FOUND. AND

00:19:15.087 --> 00:19:16.255
WHAT WE FOUND WAS THE NEWS

00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:17.256
THREE THOSE THREE APPROACHES

00:19:17.322 --> 00:19:18.757
ENDORSEMENT TEMPORARY AND AN

00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:20.325
EXPEDITED DID NOT RELIEVE THE

00:19:20.392 --> 00:19:22.728
UNDERLYING BURDEN OF LICENSING

00:19:22.794 --> 00:19:23.295
IT ONLY MADE THE PROCESS OF

00:19:23.362 --> 00:19:26.064
APPLYING FASTER AND WE ALSO

00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:27.232
FOUND THE BOARDS WERE NOT

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:27.799
UNIFORMLY IMPLEMENTING STATE

00:19:27.866 --> 00:19:32.771
LAWS. I WERE CALIFORNIA STOOD

00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:34.072
WITH THAT WAS THAT CALIFORNIA

00:19:34.139 --> 00:19:37.242
HAD TEMPORARY LICENSING FOR

00:19:37.309 --> 00:19:41.513
NINE PROGRAMS AND- EXPEDITED

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.116
LICENSING FOR MILITARY SPOUSES

00:19:44.182 --> 00:19:47.319
BUT DID NOT HAVE REAL A REAL

00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:47.920
AND STILL DOES NOT HAVE A REAL

00:19:47.986 --> 00:19:51.690
EASY ENDORSEMENT PROCESS. AND I

00:19:51.757 --> 00:19:53.692
JUST WANNA LEAVE THIS HERE I'M

00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:56.094
NOT GOING TO READ THIS BUT I.

00:19:56.161 --> 00:19:57.362
BECAUSE WE HAVE SPOUSES ARE

00:19:57.429 --> 00:19:59.097
GOING TO BE PROVIDING THE SAME

00:19:59.164 --> 00:20:02.234
KIND OF TESTIMONY BUT THE FIRST

00:20:02.301 --> 00:20:04.570
EXAMPLE DOES SHOW THIS IS I'M A

00:20:04.636 --> 00:20:05.370
MILITARY SPOUSE TEACHER IN

00:20:05.437 --> 00:20:08.140
CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA I THINK

CREDENTIALING IS PROBABLY AN

00:20:14.446 --> 00:20:16.481
EXAMPLE OF A LIKE A MODEL

00:20:16.548 --> 00:20:18.417
EXAMPLE OF A OF A BOARD THAT.

00:20:18.483 --> 00:20:20.819
THAT YOU KNOW KIND OF HAD THE

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:22.621
POLICIES ARE THAT ARE IN PLACE

00:20:22.688 --> 00:20:23.989
FOR TEACHERS IS PROBABLY MORE

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:24.790
ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT WE'RE

00:20:24.856 --> 00:20:27.092
LOOKING FOR OTHER BOARDS. BUT

00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:28.293

00:38:07.184 --> 00:38:08.019
QUESTION FOR THIS HOW DO WE

00:38:08.085 --> 00:38:10.354
EVALUATE YEAH THESE FIRST TWO

00:38:10.421 --> 00:38:12.857
ARGUMENTS RIGHT ONE SAYS THAT

00:38:29.974 --> 00:38:34.645
I THINK THE CONCERN IS THE OF

00:38:34.712 --> 00:38:36.580
SETTING THEMSELVES IN COURT

00:38:36.647 --> 00:38:38.849

THINK THERE ARE AT LEAST ELEVEN

00:40:44.975 --> 00:40:45.810
OTHER STATES THAT HAVE THAT

00:40:45.876 --> 00:40:47.978
COMPONENT IS A REQUIREMENT. AS

00:40:48.045 --> 00:40:50.581
WELL AS MENTORING COMPONENT BUT

00:40:50.648 --> 00:40:52.316
IT WAS A LOT THERE WE DID

00:40:52.383 --> 00:40:53.651
GATHER A LOT OF DISCUSSION

00:40:53.717 --> 00:40:55.252
AROUND THAT TOPIC ITSELF WHICH

00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:56.921
IS WHY THE BOARD IS A COMMITTED

00:40:56.987 --> 00:40:59.757
TO REVISITING THIS ISSUE SO I'M

00:40:59.824 --> 00:41:00.691
TWO YEARS DOWN THE LINE WE'RE

00:41:00.758 --> 00:41:02.593
GOING TO LOOK AT WHAT KIND OF.

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:05.062
IMPACT IT HAS LIKE IN TERMS OF

00:41:05.129 --> 00:41:06.931
ACCESSIBILITY FOR MILITARY

00:41:06.997 --> 00:41:10.868
SPOUSE ATTORNEYS. AS WELL AS

00:41:10.935 --> 00:41:11.402
DISTANT IMPACT THAT YOU'RE

00:41:11.468 --> 00:41:16.907
DESCRIBING. NOW I KNOW LAW HAS

00:41:16.974 --> 00:41:17.374
ITS OWN UNIQUE SET OF

00:41:17.441 --> 00:41:17.908
CHALLENGES BECAUSE OF HOW

00:41:17.975 --> 00:41:22.379
DIFFERENT. STATE LAWS. CAN BE

00:41:22.446 --> 00:41:22.847
IN AND THE IMPACTS OF

00:41:22.913 --> 00:41:26.817
PROCEDURES AFTER BUT. I WANTED

00:41:26.884 --> 00:41:27.451
TO ALSO ASK YOU KNOW IF THERE'S

00:41:27.518 --> 00:41:29.353
THIS REPORT THAT CAME OUT OF

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:30.321
UNIVERSITY MINISTERING TO THE

00:41:30.387 --> 00:41:31.889
REACH REPORT THAT IS ON THE

00:41:31.956 --> 00:41:32.790
MEMBERS YOU CAN SEE ON. TAB

00:41:32.857 --> 00:41:36.760
SEVEN. OF YOUR BOOKLETS AND IT

00:41:36.827 --> 00:41:38.095
COMES OUT THEY DID A REPORTING

00:41:38.162 --> 00:41:39.463
ON EVERY STATE IN THE COUNTRY

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:40.064
LOOKING AT LEGISLATION LOOKING

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:40.598
AT THE STATE OF PLAY THEY

00:41:40.664 --> 00:41:43.234
LOOKED AT VARIOUS. HI.

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:45.603
DIFFERENT AREAS OF LICENSURE IN

00:41:45.669 --> 00:41:46.237
ONE OF THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS AT

00:41:46.303 --> 00:41:48.706
THE END. WITH A FREE FUTURE

00:41:48.772 --> 00:41:50.307
EFFORTS COULD ADVOCATE TO

00:41:50.374 --> 00:41:51.909
MODIFY OUR EXISTING LEGISLATION

00:41:51.976 --> 00:41:54.645
AB ONE EIGHTY SIX AND IN

00:41:54.712 --> 00:41:55.145
NINETEEN OH FOUR TO READ

00:41:55.212 --> 00:41:58.215
OCCUPATIONAL BOARD SHALL ALLOW

00:41:58.282 --> 00:41:58.716
SHELL ALLOW LICENSURE BY

00:41:58.782 --> 00:42:00.351
ENDORSEMENT FOR SPOUSES NOW.

00:42:00.417 --> 00:42:02.720
YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S A JUST

00:42:02.786 --> 00:42:03.354
SO I UNDERSTAND THAT WOULD JUST

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:06.490
MEAN THAT LITERALLY. A LICENSE

00:42:06.557 --> 00:42:07.424
FROM ANOTHER STATE WOULD BE

00:42:07.491 --> 00:42:09.126
IMMEDIATE WOULD BE IMMEDIATELY

00:42:09.193 --> 00:42:10.828
PORTABLE WITH NO QUESTIONS

00:42:10.895 --> 00:42:13.764
ASKED. I HAVE ONE MORE SLIDE

00:42:13.831 --> 00:42:16.333
THAT KIND OF EXPLAINS THOSE

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:20.738
RECOMMENDATIONS BUT IT. YES SO

00:42:20.804 --> 00:42:23.140
THAT ONE ENDORSEMENT ONE EIGHTY

00:42:23.207 --> 00:42:25.142
SIX IS TEMPORARY LICENSE SO WE

00:42:25.209 --> 00:42:26.777
ARE I BELIEVE THAT'S THE ONE

00:42:26.844 --> 00:42:29.413
THAT IS A VERY LICENSURE FOR

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:33.284
NINE PROGRAMS. MIA IF THERE. OF

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:34.685
SO WHAT WE'RE KIND OF LOOKING

00:42:34.752 --> 00:42:38.923
AT IS. TAKING NINE AND

00:42:38.989 --> 00:42:41.325
EXPANDING IT RECOMMENDING THAT

00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:42.526
THAT STATES REALLY LOOK AT

00:42:42.593 --> 00:42:44.395
EXPANDING THAT THAT KIND OF

00:42:44.461 --> 00:42:46.130
POLICY WHICH IS BASICALLY AN

00:42:46.196 --> 00:42:49.900
EXTENDED TEMPORARY LICENSE THAT

00:42:49.967 --> 00:42:50.467
WOULD GIVE THAT WOULD DO TWO

00:42:50.534 --> 00:42:54.872
THINGS. BUT STILL TEMPORARY YES

00:42:54.939 --> 00:42:56.073
IT'S STILL A WELL AS FAR AS THE

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.675
AT ONE EIGHTY SIX THAT WE'RE

00:42:57.741 --> 00:42:58.342
NOT IN THE WITH WITH THE REDS

00:42:58.409 --> 00:42:59.810
THIS RECOMMENDATION THAT THAT

00:42:59.877 --> 00:43:01.912
IS HERE THIS IDEA OF LICENSURE

00:43:01.979 --> 00:43:03.714
BY ENDORSEMENT OKAY SO THE

00:43:03.781 --> 00:43:06.050
LICENSURE BY ENDORSEMENT THOUGH

00:43:06.116 --> 00:43:08.018
IS SO WE KIND OF HAVE TO ASK

00:43:08.085 --> 00:43:08.986
FLEMING CAM BACK CHECK A LITTLE

00:43:09.053 --> 00:43:12.856
BIT. SO WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME

00:43:12.923 --> 00:43:14.525
STATES THAT HAVE EXPANDED

00:43:14.591 --> 00:43:15.559
BASICALLY LICENSURE BY

00:43:15.626 --> 00:43:18.195
ENDORSEMENT TO THIS TERM OF

00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:20.864
RECOGNITION SO WE WENT FROM.

00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:23.233
THIS FROM LOOKING AT IT FROM A

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.835
WRIST RECIPROCITY STANDPOINT

00:43:24.902 --> 00:43:29.006
BECAUSE. REST OF RECIPROCITY

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:31.342
INFERS THAT THERE'S A- MUTUAL

00:43:31.408 --> 00:43:34.378
AGREEMENT BETWEEN PARTIES WHICH

00:43:34.445 --> 00:43:35.179
WE'RE NOT REALLY LOOKING AT

00:43:35.245 --> 00:43:36.780
RECIPROCITY WHEN WE'RE ASKING

00:43:36.847 --> 00:43:37.414
FOR EXPANSION OF LICENSURE BY

00:43:37.481 --> 00:43:38.916
ENDORSEMENT TO IN BASICALLY

00:43:38.983 --> 00:43:40.017
BECOMING LICENSURE BY

00:43:40.084 --> 00:43:42.086
RECOGNITION ARIZONA AND

00:43:42.152 --> 00:43:46.857
RECENTLY PASSED A BILL H. B.

00:43:46.924 --> 00:43:47.424
TWENTY FIVE SIXTY NINE THAT

00:43:47.491 --> 00:43:48.826
ALREADY WAS AVAILABLE FOR

00:43:48.892 --> 00:43:50.260
SPOUSES THEY ACTUALLY DID THE

00:43:50.327 --> 00:43:51.028
OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING

00:43:51.095 --> 00:43:52.997
AT THEY EXPANDED AND AN

00:43:53.063 --> 00:43:54.331
OPPORTUNITY THAT WAS ALREADY

00:43:54.398 --> 00:43:56.400
FOR SPOUSES TO THEIR GENERAL

00:43:56.467 --> 00:43:58.202
POPULATION SO NOW ANYONE COMING

00:43:58.268 --> 00:44:00.804
INTO ARIZONA WITH THE LICENSE

00:44:00.871 --> 00:44:04.708
OUT OF STATE. HAS THEIR FINGER

00:44:04.775 --> 00:44:06.110
PRINTING AND BACKGROUND CHECK

00:44:06.176 --> 00:44:08.112
DONE. THE I'M PAY THE FEE AND

00:44:08.178 --> 00:44:09.279
THEN DATE ESSENTIALLY GET AN

00:44:09.346 --> 00:44:12.182
ARIZONA LICENSE WITH BASICALLY

00:44:12.249 --> 00:44:13.717
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE PREVIOUS

00:44:13.784 --> 00:44:17.054
STATE STATES LICENSE SHOWS THAT

00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:19.590
THEY ARE QUALIFIED TO PERFORM

00:44:19.656 --> 00:44:21.191
THAT POSITION THAT JOB. AND SO

00:44:21.258 --> 00:44:23.727
ARIZONA STAMPS THEIR THEIR

00:44:23.794 --> 00:44:24.762
THEIR LICENSE AND THEY GET A

00:44:24.828 --> 00:44:26.964
LICENSURE BY RECOGNITION

00:44:27.031 --> 00:44:28.265
FLORIDA DOES THAT TOO AND I

00:44:28.332 --> 00:44:30.467
AWAY ACTUALLY DOES SOMETHING

00:44:30.534 --> 00:44:32.236
SIMILAR BUT JUST FOR TEACHERS

00:44:32.302 --> 00:44:34.438
SO. THAT THE ENDORSEMENT PIECE

00:44:34.505 --> 00:44:36.974
OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS

00:44:37.041 --> 00:44:38.108
ASKING STATES TO LOOK AT THOSE

00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:40.110
STATES. GET THOSE OTHER THOSE

00:44:40.177 --> 00:44:43.080
OTHER MODELS AND AT LEAST FOR

00:44:43.147 --> 00:44:44.581
MILITARY SPOUSES ACKNOWLEDGING

00:44:44.648 --> 00:44:46.216
THAT MILITARY SPOUSES MOVE

00:44:46.283 --> 00:44:47.618
EVERY THREE TO FOUR YEARS BY

00:44:47.684 --> 00:44:48.752
THE TIME THEY GO THROUGH ALL

00:44:48.819 --> 00:44:50.087
THIS PROCESSING OF. THIS ALL

00:44:50.154 --> 00:44:52.322
ALL THIS PROCESS OF. OF GETTING

00:44:52.389 --> 00:44:54.658
AFFIDAVITS GETTING I

00:44:54.725 --> 00:44:55.793
ENDORSEMENTS FROM THEIR

00:44:55.859 --> 00:44:57.728
PREVIOUS EMPLOYERS GETTING ALL

00:44:57.795 --> 00:44:59.063
THEIR TRANSCRIPTS THEN HAVING

00:44:59.129 --> 00:45:01.365
THE BOARDS. SPEND SOME TIME

00:45:01.432 --> 00:45:04.535
EVALUATING WHETHER IT'S

00:45:04.601 --> 00:45:06.203
SUBSTANTIALLY EQUIVALENT WHICH

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:10.307
IS USUALLY. SUBSTANTIALLY

00:45:10.374 --> 00:45:15.612
EQUIVALENT IS THE EASE. AT ST.

00:45:15.679 --> 00:45:16.513
SINCE BY ENDORSEMENTS THAT'S

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:17.114
CAUSING THE UNDERLYING ISSUE

00:45:17.181 --> 00:45:18.082
FOR SPOUSES IS THAT THERE'S AN

00:45:18.148 --> 00:45:18.582
EVALUATION PROCESS WHERE

00:45:18.649 --> 00:45:19.616
CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE OR OTHER

00:45:19.683 --> 00:45:20.184
STATES BUT CALIFORNIAN THIS

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:20.984
EXAMPLE WOULD LOOK AT. ALL THE

00:45:21.051 --> 00:45:21.852
COURSE WORK ALL OF THE

00:45:21.919 --> 00:45:22.686
EMPLOYMENT HISTORY EVERYTHING

00:45:22.753 --> 00:45:23.921
AND THEN MAKE A DETERMINATION

00:45:23.987 --> 00:45:24.521
IF THEY GET A CALIFORNIA

00:45:24.588 --> 00:45:27.024
LICENSE SO THERE'S THIS AND

00:45:27.091 --> 00:45:29.293
THIS DELAY CAUSED BY HAVING TO.

00:45:29.359 --> 00:45:30.828
SUBMIT ALL THOSE DOCUMENTS THEN

00:45:30.894 --> 00:45:33.230
WAIT FOR THE AT THE EVALUATION

00:45:33.297 --> 00:45:35.933
SO WE'RE ASKING FOR A LICENSURE

00:45:35.999 --> 00:45:36.533
BY ENDORSEMENT OR RECOGNITION

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:40.003
WITHOUT. THIS LONG DRAWN OUT

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:42.039
PROCESS OF EVALUATION OF STEP

00:45:42.106 --> 00:45:43.040
SUBSTANTIAL AND WE'RE ASKING

00:45:43.107 --> 00:45:45.476
FOR IT JUST A IN PERPETUITY OR

00:45:45.542 --> 00:45:47.211
FOR THE TIME THAT THEY ARE

00:45:47.277 --> 00:45:47.978
STATE THAT THERE THERE'S A

00:45:48.045 --> 00:45:49.580
HOUSES THE STATION. YES

00:45:49.646 --> 00:45:52.149
CALIFORNIA SO THERE'S DIFFERENT

00:45:52.216 --> 00:45:53.083
MODELS AT DIFFERENT STATES DUE

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.684
TO WE DON'T TELL THE STATE'S

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:55.552
WHAT TO DO BUT WE WE'VE LOOKED

00:45:55.619 --> 00:45:56.553
AT A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:57.621
MODELS AND I THINK FOR

00:45:57.688 --> 00:46:00.324
CALIFORNIA. THIS IS KIND OF THE

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:03.193
THIS IS ONE FRAMEWORK. NUMBER

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:05.529
ONE PROVIDE EXTENDED TEMPORARY

00:46:05.596 --> 00:46:07.197
LICENSE FOR MILITARY SPOUSES SO

00:46:07.264 --> 00:46:08.765
THAT THEY CAN GET A LICENSE

00:46:08.832 --> 00:46:10.934
WITH THEIR- FINGER PRINTING AND

00:46:11.001 --> 00:46:13.070
A BACKGROUND CHECK AND THEY'RE

00:46:13.137 --> 00:46:13.670
ON A VERIFICATION THAT THEIR

00:46:13.737 --> 00:46:16.240
LICENSES GOOD IN GOOD STANDING.

00:46:16.306 --> 00:46:17.107
THAT THEY WOULD FILL OUT THE%

00:46:17.174 --> 00:46:19.309
APPLICATION BE ABLE TO HAVE

00:46:19.376 --> 00:46:21.311
THAT APPLICATION EXPEDITED GET

00:46:21.378 --> 00:46:23.213
THEIR LICENSE AND THEN BE

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:23.981
PROVIDED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

00:46:24.047 --> 00:46:26.016
TIME TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIALLY

00:46:26.083 --> 00:46:27.484
SUBSTANTIATING DOCUMENTS.

00:46:27.551 --> 00:46:28.485
THAT'S FOR IF THEY WANT A FULL

00:46:28.552 --> 00:46:29.853
ENDORSEMENT BUT IF THEY DON'T

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:30.654
WANT A FULL ENDORSEMENT AND

00:46:30.721 --> 00:46:32.055
THEY JUST WANT TO WORK WHILE

00:46:32.122 --> 00:46:34.324
THEY'RE IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE

00:46:34.391 --> 00:46:35.058
TWO TO THREE YEARS WE'RE ALSO

00:46:35.125 --> 00:46:38.195
ASKING STATES TO. CONSIDER JUST

00:46:38.262 --> 00:46:40.097
A LONG JUST A TEMPER EXTENDED

00:46:40.164 --> 00:46:41.598
TEMPORARY LICENSE THROUGH THE

00:46:41.665 --> 00:46:42.332
PERIOD OF TIME THAT THEY'RE

00:46:42.399 --> 00:46:47.838
HERE. NOW THEY. DECIDE TO STAY

00:46:47.905 --> 00:46:48.438
LONGER THAN THEY WOULD NEED TO

00:46:48.505 --> 00:46:52.876
GO THROUGH A PROCESS OF.

00:46:52.943 --> 00:46:53.510
CONVERTING THEIR LICENSE INTO A

00:46:53.577 --> 00:46:55.112
FULL CALIFORNIA LICENSE. I

00:46:55.179 --> 00:46:57.648
GUESS MY QUESTION I'M- TO MISS

00:46:57.714 --> 00:46:58.582
SCHOOL AND MISS NEW YES IS WHAT

00:46:58.649 --> 00:46:59.883
WOULD BE. WHAT'S YOUR REACTION

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:00.951
TO THAT SORT OF PROPOSAL DOES

00:47:01.018 --> 00:47:02.553
THAT SOUND. REASONABLE DO A

00:47:02.619 --> 00:47:03.053
BALL IN YOUR RESPECTIVE

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:06.390
PROFESSIONS. AM I THINK THE WE

00:47:06.456 --> 00:47:07.191
ARE HALFWAY THERE ALREADY I

00:47:07.257 --> 00:47:09.193
THINK THAT OUR INITIAL

00:47:09.259 --> 00:47:10.394
LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:13.697
TEACHING. IS A DOT THEY HAVE A

00:47:13.764 --> 00:47:14.831
BACHELOR'S DEGREE FOR

00:47:14.898 --> 00:47:16.266
REGIONALLY ACCREDITED COLLEGE

00:47:16.333 --> 00:47:17.534
OR UNIVERSITY. THAT THEY HAVE

00:47:17.601 --> 00:47:19.836
THE FINGERPRINT CLEARANCE AND

00:47:19.903 --> 00:47:21.305
THAT THE HAVE THAT COMPARABLE

00:47:21.371 --> 00:47:22.673
OUT OF STATE LICENSE SO I THINK

00:47:22.739 --> 00:47:24.174
THE ONLY ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT

00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:25.209
THAT WE HAVE FOR INITIAL

00:47:25.275 --> 00:47:26.977
LICENSURE IS THAT BACHELOR'S

00:47:27.044 --> 00:47:30.914
DEGREE. I DON'T KNOW THAT

00:47:30.981 --> 00:47:32.783
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD.

00:47:32.849 --> 00:47:34.151
THE COMMISSION WOULD CONSIDER

00:47:34.218 --> 00:47:35.586
REMOVAL ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THAT

00:47:35.652 --> 00:47:37.354
IS A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT FOR

00:47:37.421 --> 00:47:38.689
ALL CALIFORNIANS PREPARED THE

00:47:38.755 --> 00:47:41.024
BACHELOR'S DEGREE YEAH I'M IT'S

00:47:41.091 --> 00:47:41.758
NOT OFTEN THAT WE SEE

00:47:41.825 --> 00:47:42.893
INDIVIDUALS COMING FROM OUT OF

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:43.927
STATE THEY DON'T HAVE THAT

00:47:43.994 --> 00:47:44.928
BACHELOR'S DEGREE THOUGH THAT'S

00:47:44.995 --> 00:47:47.531
A VERY VERY RARE. HOWEVER WE

00:47:47.598 --> 00:47:49.066
ARE CEASING SOME INTERESTING

00:47:49.132 --> 00:47:50.801
THINGS HAPPENING OUT OF STATE

00:47:50.867 --> 00:47:52.536
WITH CONCERNS FOR TEACHER

00:47:52.603 --> 00:47:54.571
SHORTAGES SO THERE ARE SOME

00:47:54.638 --> 00:47:56.840
VERY INTERESTING LICENSURE

00:47:56.907 --> 00:47:57.674
PATHWAYS THAT ARE BEING

00:47:57.741 --> 00:47:59.977
DEVELOPED RIGHT NOW THAT COULD

00:48:00.043 --> 00:48:01.478
VERY WELL RESULT IN INDIVIDUALS

00:48:01.545 --> 00:48:02.913
COMING IN WITHOUT A BACHELOR'S

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:04.448
DEGREE BUT AGAIN THAT DOESN'T

00:48:04.514 --> 00:48:06.149
HAPPEN OFTEN I THINK IT IS

00:48:06.216 --> 00:48:07.784
SOMETHING THAT YOU SPOKE TO

00:48:07.851 --> 00:48:10.454
REGARDING. MILITARY SPOUSES WAY

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:12.723
TO COME IN FOR JUST TWO YEARS

00:48:12.789 --> 00:48:14.024
AND SERVING A TEMPORARY

00:48:14.091 --> 00:48:18.161
CAPACITY I'M IS A REALLY

00:48:18.228 --> 00:48:21.598
INTERESTING THOUGHT THAT I'M

00:48:21.665 --> 00:48:22.199
DEFINITELY GOING TO TAKE BACK

00:48:22.266 --> 00:48:26.203
AND HAVE A CONVERSATION.

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:27.204
TEACHING PERMIT REQUIRES A

00:48:27.271 --> 00:48:27.904
BACHELOR'S DEGREE BUT IT ALSO

00:48:27.971 --> 00:48:28.872
REQUIRES PASSAGE OF THE

00:48:28.939 --> 00:48:29.840
CALIFORNIA BASIC SKILLS EXAM.

00:48:29.906 --> 00:48:31.074
INDIVIDUALS CAN USE AN EXAM

00:48:31.141 --> 00:48:31.975
FROM OUT OF STATE IF THEY'VE

00:48:32.042 --> 00:48:34.077
TAKEN A COMPARABLE BASIC SKILLS

00:48:34.144 --> 00:48:35.078
EXAM THAT COVERS READING

00:48:35.145 --> 00:48:37.547
WRITING AND MATHEMATICS. BUT IF

00:48:37.614 --> 00:48:38.849
THE STATE DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT

00:48:38.915 --> 00:48:40.584
TYPE OF EXAM THAN AN INDIVIDUAL

00:48:40.651 --> 00:48:41.551
WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THAT SEE

00:48:41.618 --> 00:48:44.254
BEST EXAM IN ORDER TO. EARNED

00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:45.922
THAT SUBSTITUTE TEACHING PERMIT

00:48:45.989 --> 00:48:46.723
IF THEY JUST WANT TO COME IN

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:48.525
AND BE A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER.

00:48:48.592 --> 00:48:49.593
I'M SO I THINK THAT THAT'S

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.128
SOMETHING THAT WE COULD LOOK AT

00:48:51.194 --> 00:48:52.996
TO SEE WHERE WE COULD MAKE SOME

00:48:53.063 --> 00:48:54.865
CONCESSIONS THERE AND POSSIBLY

00:48:54.931 --> 00:48:56.266
DO SOME TYPE OF BASIC SKILLS

00:48:56.333 --> 00:48:58.235
EXAM WEAVER OR SOMETHING FOR

00:48:58.302 --> 00:49:00.737
THESE MILITARY SPOUSES. I WENT

00:49:00.804 --> 00:49:05.309
OUT. AND FOR THE STATE BAR WE

00:49:05.375 --> 00:49:06.843
DON'T HAVE RECIPROCITY IS THAT

00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:08.412
RECIPROCITY PROGRAM OUTSIDE A

00:49:08.478 --> 00:49:10.814
MILITARY SPOUSE FAMILIES SHOW

00:49:10.881 --> 00:49:13.717
OF WE HAVE A UNIQUE SET UP IN

00:49:13.784 --> 00:49:15.452
TERMS OF WE DON'T USE FOR

00:49:15.519 --> 00:49:17.120
EXAMPLE THE UNIFORMED BARK THE

00:49:17.187 --> 00:49:19.389
UNIFORM BAR EXAM WHICH A LOT OF

00:49:19.456 --> 00:49:20.090
STATES DO YOU AND ALLOW

00:49:20.157 --> 00:49:22.225
RECIPROCITY FOR THAT REASON

00:49:22.292 --> 00:49:23.760
HOWEVER IN TERMS OF AN EXTENDED

00:49:23.827 --> 00:49:25.929
TEMPORARY LICENSE. BEDS I THINK

00:49:25.996 --> 00:49:27.230
WERE PARTIALLY THERE WITH OUR

00:49:27.297 --> 00:49:29.800
CURRENT PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE A

00:49:29.866 --> 00:49:30.901
DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE

00:49:30.967 --> 00:49:32.102
TO GO THROUGH FINGERPRINT

00:49:32.169 --> 00:49:33.403
BACKGROUND CHECK IN THE FORM OF

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:34.237
THE MORAL CHARACTER

00:49:34.304 --> 00:49:36.073
INVESTIGATION THAT OCCURS

00:49:36.139 --> 00:49:37.207
YOU'RE STILL ALLOWED TO WORK

00:49:37.274 --> 00:49:39.176
WHILE THAT A FORMAL PROCESSOR

00:49:39.242 --> 00:49:41.845
INVESTIGATION IS HAPPENING SO

00:49:41.912 --> 00:49:45.782
IN TERMS OF THE TEMPER

00:49:45.849 --> 00:49:46.416
LICENSING I THINK THAT'S NOT AN

00:49:46.483 --> 00:49:51.822
IMPEDIMENT. OKAY I WANT I WANT

00:49:51.888 --> 00:49:52.456
ONE FINAL QUESTION I WANT TO GO

00:49:52.522 --> 00:49:53.490
TO CHAIR A GLAZER AND THAT IS

00:49:53.557 --> 00:49:54.958
THIS ISSUE SO ONE OF THE ISSUES

00:49:55.025 --> 00:49:55.926
THAT CAME UP AT THE COUNCIL

00:49:55.992 --> 00:49:58.128
STATE GOVERNMENTS. I'M KIND OF

00:49:58.195 --> 00:49:59.096
ONE DAY I DID A FULL DAY

00:49:59.162 --> 00:50:00.030
SESSION ON THIS THIS THIS ISSUE

00:50:00.097 --> 00:50:00.731
OF LICENSURE IS VERY

00:50:00.797 --> 00:50:01.465
INTERESTING. ONE OF THE ISSUES

00:50:01.531 --> 00:50:02.966
THAT THAT THAT STATES CONTINUE

00:50:03.033 --> 00:50:04.101
TO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT IS

00:50:04.167 --> 00:50:06.570
DISCIPLINARY RECORDS. AND WHO

00:50:06.636 --> 00:50:08.672
HOLD THOSE RECORDS HOW DO YOU

00:50:08.739 --> 00:50:09.706
MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S-

00:50:09.773 --> 00:50:11.708
ACCOUNTABILITY OF SOMEONE BEING

00:50:11.775 --> 00:50:12.876
A BEHAVES BADLY IN ONE STATE

00:50:12.943 --> 00:50:13.643
THAT THERE ARE SOME

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:14.745
ACCOUNTABILITY OTHER STATES AND

00:50:14.811 --> 00:50:15.712
WE'RE NOT GONNA PASSING ON

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:17.381
PROBLEMS. AND THIS IS A COURSE

00:50:17.447 --> 00:50:18.582
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A MINUSCULE

00:50:18.648 --> 00:50:19.983
PORTION OF CERTAINLY THE

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:21.685
MILITARY SPOUSE POPULATION BUT

00:50:21.752 --> 00:50:22.886
IT'S THE KIND OF THING THEY CAN

00:50:22.953 --> 00:50:24.554
GET ALL OF OUR EFFORTS HUNG UP.

00:50:24.621 --> 00:50:26.690
I AND ONE OF THINGS I ASK YOUR

00:50:26.757 --> 00:50:28.592
COLLEAGUE FROM THE NORTHWEST

00:50:28.658 --> 00:50:33.697
WAS. ON BECAUSE THEY'RE SUCH.

00:50:33.764 --> 00:50:34.231
IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE YOU'VE

00:50:34.297 --> 00:50:39.035
FOLKS MOVING AROUND SO MUCH.

00:50:39.102 --> 00:50:39.636
MAYBE THE DEPARTMENT DEFENSE

00:50:39.703 --> 00:50:40.537
OUGHT TO BE THE KEEPERS OF THE

00:50:40.604 --> 00:50:41.138
DATE OF THE DISCIPLINARY

00:50:41.204 --> 00:50:42.839
DATABASE. SO AS TO BE ABLE TO

00:50:42.906 --> 00:50:44.541
EXPEDITE. I YOU TO TRANSFER ALL

00:50:44.608 --> 00:50:46.743
TO. THE CREDENTIAL OURS. SO

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:48.912
THAT YOU'LL ALL HAVE YOU KNOW

00:50:48.979 --> 00:50:50.714
COME A CREDIBLE PACKET TO LOOK

00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:52.315
AT IF THEY'RE IN A TO DO TO

00:50:52.382 --> 00:50:54.284
ENSURE THAT. THAT THAT THAT

00:50:54.351 --> 00:50:55.419
SOMEONE DOES NOT HAVE A

00:50:55.485 --> 00:50:56.686
DISCIPLINARY RECORD IN ANY

00:50:56.753 --> 00:50:57.654
STATE IN THE COUNTRY WHERE

00:50:57.721 --> 00:50:58.388
THEY'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A

00:50:58.455 --> 00:50:59.556
DUDE. THE THIRD THIRD JUST.

00:50:59.623 --> 00:51:03.160
ACCOUNTABILITY. IN ANSWERS

00:51:03.226 --> 00:51:03.794
ASSOCIATED THAT IT MAY ACTUALLY

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:07.330
BE. AN APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR

00:51:07.397 --> 00:51:08.298
THIS TO BE HOUSE AFTER YOU.

00:51:08.365 --> 00:51:10.133
ANYWAY I'D LOVE TO SEE IF YOU

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:10.767
HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK INTO THAT

00:51:10.834 --> 00:51:11.902
OF LAST MONTH AND IF YOU ANY

00:51:11.968 --> 00:51:13.570
THOUGHTS ON THAT ISSUE. I

00:51:13.637 --> 00:51:16.273
REMEMBER THAT QUESTION. OKAY SO

00:51:16.339 --> 00:51:17.541
I THINK TWO THINGS THOUGH THAT

00:51:17.607 --> 00:51:18.942
WE WE'RE LOOKING AT IS AND ONE

00:51:19.009 --> 00:51:22.078
IS THAT. THERE IS IT IS FAR AS

00:51:22.145 --> 00:51:25.582
DISCIPLINARY RECORDS AND

00:51:25.649 --> 00:51:26.216
VERIFYING. THAT KIND OF THING I

00:51:26.283 --> 00:51:29.586
THINK. THAT ISN'T REALLY THE

00:51:29.653 --> 00:51:30.253
PROBLEM THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.721
SO IF WITH MILITARY SPOUSE

00:51:31.788 --> 00:51:33.423
COMES THE CALIFORNIA AND SAYS I

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:34.724
HAVE A LICENSE IN ARIZONA

00:51:34.791 --> 00:51:36.326
CALIFORNIA THAT BOARD. CAN

00:51:36.393 --> 00:51:38.228
CALLED THE BOARD AND THERE'S ON

00:51:38.295 --> 00:51:39.396
AND FIND OUT THAT SEE THAT'S

00:51:39.463 --> 00:51:41.198
THE EASY PART. THE OTHER PIECES

00:51:41.264 --> 00:51:43.300
THAT AS FAR AS DISCIPLINE GOES.

00:51:43.366 --> 00:51:44.868
WE HAVE PROGRAMS IN PLACE TO

00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:46.736
SUPPORT SPOUSES BUT WE WOULDN'T

00:51:46.803 --> 00:51:48.104
BE ABLE TO HAVE ANY SORT OF

00:51:48.171 --> 00:51:49.773
TRACKING BECAUSE THEY DON'T

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:50.907
ACTUALLY WORK FOR DEPARTMENT OF

00:51:50.974 --> 00:51:52.676
DEFENSE. SO YOU KNOW I'M SAYING

00:51:52.742 --> 00:51:53.543
WE WERE KIND OF IN THIS SPACE

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:55.512
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO. SUPPORT

00:51:55.579 --> 00:51:57.414
THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE

00:51:57.481 --> 00:51:59.216
SUPPORTING THE SERVICE MEMBER

00:51:59.282 --> 00:52:02.052
WHO'S WHO'S SERVING BUT WE

00:52:02.118 --> 00:52:03.353
CAN'T. THERE'S NO

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:04.988
ACCOUNTABILITY THAT. HAS SOARED

00:52:05.055 --> 00:52:06.523
OR IS IT IS ASKING THE TO THE

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:08.358
EXTENT THIS HAS BECOME A

00:52:08.425 --> 00:52:09.793
PROBLEM I AN INMATE MAYBE IT

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:10.861
WAS OVERSTATED THE CONFERENCE.

00:52:10.927 --> 00:52:12.095
I WAS WHAT MAYBE THEY'LL BE

00:52:12.162 --> 00:52:12.996
LIKE AN OPT IN OR SOMETHING

00:52:13.063 --> 00:52:14.731
WHERE WHERE WHERE THE SPOUSE

00:52:14.798 --> 00:52:17.367
WITH WOULD VOLUNTARILY. YOU

00:52:17.434 --> 00:52:18.602
KNOW. AUTHORIZED DEPARTMENT

00:52:18.668 --> 00:52:20.971
DEFENSE TO KIND OF. BE THE

00:52:21.037 --> 00:52:27.110
KEEPER OF THE- PACKAGE WE HAVE

00:52:27.177 --> 00:52:27.677
SO THAT SO THAT SO AS TO BE

00:52:27.744 --> 00:52:31.948
ABLE TO EXPEDITE. STATE BY

00:52:32.015 --> 00:52:32.582
STATE PORTABILITY I DON'T KNOW

00:52:32.649 --> 00:52:33.917
I. SO I THINK THAT AGAIN I

00:52:33.984 --> 00:52:34.851
THINK THAT THE MAIN ISSUE ISN'T

00:52:34.918 --> 00:52:35.619
SO ISN'T VERIFYING THEIR

00:52:35.685 --> 00:52:36.887
PREVIOUS THAT BECAUSE THAT'S ON

00:52:36.953 --> 00:52:37.954
THAT'S ON THE BOARD. TYPICALLY

00:52:38.021 --> 00:52:39.689
THEY THEY HAVE A PROCESS FOR

00:52:39.756 --> 00:52:41.258
VERIFYING THAT THE PERSONS

00:52:41.324 --> 00:52:44.094
ASIDE. AS PREVIOUS THE-

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.262
CERTIFICATION OR OR WHAT HAVE

00:52:45.328 --> 00:52:49.199
YOU. AS FAR AS KIND OF A PORTAL

00:52:49.266 --> 00:52:50.867
FOR HOLDING THEIR PREVIOUS SIX

00:52:50.934 --> 00:52:52.669
ALL OF THEIR PREVIOUS RECORDS.

00:52:52.736 --> 00:52:54.971
THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I

00:52:55.038 --> 00:52:56.239
THINK WOULD BE BENEFICIAL AND

00:52:56.306 --> 00:52:59.209
MAY BE LOOKED AT. HOWEVER ONE

00:52:59.276 --> 00:53:00.510
OF THE THINGS THAT WE ALSO SAY

00:53:00.577 --> 00:53:02.913
IS THAT. EVERY STATE IS SO

00:53:02.979 --> 00:53:03.880
DIFFERENT WITH THEIR

00:53:03.947 --> 00:53:05.081
REQUIREMENTS AND THEIR

00:53:05.148 --> 00:53:06.383
ENDORSEMENT PROCESS THAT

00:53:06.449 --> 00:53:08.385
SPOUSES DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO

00:53:08.451 --> 00:53:09.953
ANTICIPATE AS FAR AS WHAT THEY

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:11.688
NEED TO PROVIDE. SO THERE'S

00:53:11.755 --> 00:53:13.123
ALWAYS GOING TO BE KIND OF THAT

00:53:13.189 --> 00:53:15.659
UNKNOWN. OKAY WITH WITH I KNEW

00:53:15.725 --> 00:53:16.993
WHAT CALIFORNIA EXPECTED NOW

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:18.194
WHAT IS FLORIDA EXPECT WHAT IS

00:53:18.261 --> 00:53:19.796
VERGING EXPECTS SO. I JUST

00:53:19.863 --> 00:53:20.897
THINK THAT THE- THE

00:53:20.964 --> 00:53:22.465
DIFFERENCES. THAT'S KIND OF

00:53:22.532 --> 00:53:23.967
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO MITIGATE

00:53:24.034 --> 00:53:27.237
TWO IS THE IS JUST TRYING TO.

00:53:27.304 --> 00:53:28.705
RESOLVE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES

00:53:28.772 --> 00:53:30.173
THAT HAPPEN WHEN YOU HAVE STATE

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.508
TO STATE DIFFERENCES. AND WHICH

00:53:31.575 --> 00:53:32.842
WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE WE

00:53:32.909 --> 00:53:34.578
WHEN I WENT ON THE PROBLEM WITH

00:53:34.644 --> 00:53:35.111
THAT BUT JUST TRYING TO

00:53:35.178 --> 00:53:37.314
MITIGATE THAT. SO I DON'T HAVE

KIND OF THAT SATISFACTION LEVEL

00:57:14.130 --> 00:57:15.265
OR THE RESPONSE LEVEL THAT THEY

00:57:15.331 --> 00:57:16.766

ENTITIES TO. BY SOME SORT

01:07:02.218 --> 01:07:03.919
ANNUAL KIND OF REPORT ON THIS

01:07:03.986 --> 01:07:05.554

THAT MAYBE I'D. I COORDINATED

01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:22.071

YEARS SOMETIMES LONGER

01:07:39.355 --> 01:07:40.923
DEPENDING ON WHAT THE

PARTICULAR SERVICE BRANCHES AND

01:07:41.624 --> 01:07:45.027
WHAT THE. THE OCCUPATIONAL CODE

01:07:45.094 --> 01:07:47.963

AMERICA'S MILITARY FAMILIES

GOING HUNGRY. THE STORY

HIGHLIGHTED THE STRUGGLE OF A

01:11:28.384 --> 01:11:30.085
SAN DIEGO FAMILY AND THOUSANDS

01:11:30.152 --> 01:11:31.420
OF OTHER MILITARY FAMILIES

01:11:31.487 --> 01:11:33.088
ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO

ROUTINELY RELY ON ASSISTANCE TO

01:11:34.723 --> 01:11:36.825

COST OF LIVING IN SAN IN CITIES

01:11:38.327 --> 01:11:40.062
LIKE SAN DIEGO AND THE

01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:41.530
TRANSIENT MILITARY LIFESTYLE

01:11:41.597 --> 01:11:42.698
THAT MAKES IT CHALLENGING FOR

01:11:42.765 --> 01:11:44.299
SPOUSES TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE

01:11:44.366 --> 01:11:45.534
FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THEIR

01:11:45.601 --> 01:11:47.736
FAMILIES. WE'RE HERE TODAY

01:11:47.803 --> 01:11:49.271
DISCUSSING THAT LAST ISSUE

01:11:49.338 --> 01:11:51.006
CHALLENGES TO MILITARY SPOUSES

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:54.176
MAINTAINING MEANINGFUL

01:11:54.243 --> 01:11:54.777
EMPLOYMENT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

01:11:54.843 --> 01:11:58.881
THIS. IN TANGENTIALLY BUT AS OF

01:11:58.947 --> 01:11:59.415
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE

01:11:59.481 --> 01:12:00.449
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ESTIMATED

01:12:00.516 --> 01:12:01.850
THAT THE SPOUSE UNEMPLOYMENT

01:12:01.917 --> 01:12:03.485
RATE IS AS HIGH AS TWENTY FOUR

01:12:03.552 --> 01:12:05.954
PERCENT. MILITARY SPOUSES FIND

01:12:06.021 --> 01:12:07.523
THEMSELVES IN A CONSTANT

01:12:07.589 --> 01:12:09.058
RECESSION THAT

01:12:09.124 --> 01:12:09.591
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS

01:12:09.658 --> 01:12:15.064
WOMEN. SINCE 92% OF A DUTY

01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:17.166
SPOUSES ARE FEMALE THESE FEMALE

01:12:17.232 --> 01:12:19.868
SPOUSES EARN ON AVERAGE 25%

01:12:19.935 --> 01:12:20.969
LESS THAN THEIR CIVILIAN

01:12:21.036 --> 01:12:23.238
COUNTERPARTS. THESE NUMBERS ARE

01:12:23.305 --> 01:12:24.707
THE RESULT OF MANY OF A

01:12:24.773 --> 01:12:26.208
MULTIPLE SYSTEMIC BARRIERS

01:12:26.275 --> 01:12:27.543
INCLUDING EMPLOYERS LACKING IN

01:12:27.609 --> 01:12:29.078
UNDERSTANDING OF THE MILITARY

01:12:29.144 --> 01:12:31.680
LIFESTYLE THE LACK OF ACCESS TO

01:12:31.747 --> 01:12:34.249
AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE AND OVERLY

01:12:34.316 --> 01:12:35.084
BURDENSOME OCCUPATIONAL

01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:38.587
LICENSING REQUIREMENTS. MY

01:12:38.654 --> 01:12:39.221
STORY HIGHLIGHTS THE CHALLENGES

01:12:39.288 --> 01:12:41.957
WITH LICENSING I WENT TO LAW

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:43.759
SCHOOL IN SAN DIEGO PASSED THE

01:12:43.826 --> 01:12:45.461
CALIFORNIA BAR AND EVENTUALLY

01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:46.595
STARTED MY OWN FIRM IN SAN

01:12:46.662 --> 01:12:49.164
DIEGO. THEN IN TWO THOUSAND

01:12:49.231 --> 01:12:50.065
TWELVE MY HUSBAND EMAILED ME

01:12:50.132 --> 01:12:52.067
FROM AFGHANISTAN TO SAY THAT

01:12:52.134 --> 01:12:53.569
THE NAVY WAS RELOCATING HIM TO

01:12:53.635 --> 01:12:55.738
FLORIDA UPON HIS RETURN. HE

01:12:55.804 --> 01:12:57.272
WOULD BE ISSUED ORDERS FOR A

01:12:57.339 --> 01:12:59.274
PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION

01:12:59.341 --> 01:13:00.743
WHICH I FIND TO BE A VERY

01:13:00.809 --> 01:13:02.544
IRONIC TERM BECAUSE THERE'S

01:13:02.611 --> 01:13:04.113
NOTHING PERMANENT ABOUT BEING

01:13:04.179 --> 01:13:06.482
IN THE MILITARY. A MILITARY

01:13:06.548 --> 01:13:07.750
FAMILIES MOVE ON AVERAGE EVERY

01:13:07.816 --> 01:13:09.284
TWO OR THREE YEARS I

01:13:09.351 --> 01:13:11.019
IMMEDIATELY RESEARCH AND

01:13:11.086 --> 01:13:12.187
DISCOVERED THAT IN ORDER TO

01:13:12.254 --> 01:13:13.655
CONTINUE WORKING IN FLORIDA AS

01:13:13.722 --> 01:13:15.858
AN ATTORNEY I WOULD HAVE TO SIT

01:13:15.924 --> 01:13:17.760
FOR YET ANOTHER BAR EXAM. I

01:13:17.826 --> 01:13:19.261
WOULD HAVE BEEN MY THIRD AFTER

01:13:19.328 --> 01:13:21.730
CALIFORNIA AND WASHINGTON STATE

01:13:21.797 --> 01:13:23.365
ON THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE

01:13:23.432 --> 01:13:25.467
EXAMINATION A PREP COURSE ALL

01:13:25.534 --> 01:13:28.737
OF THE PREPARATION THAT GOES

01:13:28.804 --> 01:13:30.472
INTO THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT

01:13:30.539 --> 01:13:31.874
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. ALSO

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:34.977
WING INTO MY DECISION MAKING

01:13:35.043 --> 01:13:35.978
WAS WOULD I BE ABLE TO BUILD A

01:13:36.044 --> 01:13:38.147
NEW CLIENT BASE SIR YOU TALKED

01:13:38.213 --> 01:13:39.548
ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW WITH THOSE

01:13:39.615 --> 01:13:41.250
LIMITED WINDOW OF TIME THAT WE

01:13:41.316 --> 01:13:42.518
HAVE WOULD I BE ABLE TO BUILD A

01:13:42.584 --> 01:13:44.586
NEW CLIENT BASE. OR WOULD I BE

01:13:44.653 --> 01:13:49.324
ABLE TO FIND SOMEONE TO HIRE ME

01:13:49.391 --> 01:13:49.892
UP IN A PLACE WHERE I HAD NO

01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:53.695
PROFESSIONAL NETWORK. COMMITTEE

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:54.663
I DECIDED NOT TO SIT FOR THIRD

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:55.397
EXAM. AS THE TIMING AND IT.

01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:56.365
DIDN'T MAKE SENSE FOR US. WE

01:13:56.431 --> 01:13:58.267
MOVED THREE MORE TIMES. BEFORE

01:13:58.333 --> 01:13:59.868
RETURNING TO SAN DIEGO LAST

01:13:59.935 --> 01:14:02.437
YEAR SO WE MOVED FOUR TIMES IN

01:14:02.504 --> 01:14:04.706
SIX YEARS. IT WAS QUITE SIMPLY

01:14:04.773 --> 01:14:06.141
IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE

01:14:06.208 --> 01:14:08.343
CYCLE OF MOVING. TAKING A BAR

01:14:08.410 --> 01:14:10.479
EXAMINATION AND FINDING A NEW A

01:14:10.546 --> 01:14:12.748
NEW JOB IN EACH NEW LOCATION. I

01:14:12.815 --> 01:14:13.949
QUESTIONED WHETHER IT COULD

01:14:14.016 --> 01:14:15.551
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT MY HUSBAND

01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:17.085
SERVICE WITHOUT LOSING MY OWN

01:14:17.152 --> 01:14:19.354
CAREER AND A PIECE OF MYSELF.

01:14:19.421 --> 01:14:20.989
FORTUNATELY I DISCOVERED THE

01:14:21.056 --> 01:14:22.124
MILITARY SPOUSE TREATING

01:14:22.191 --> 01:14:24.126
NETWORK. OF OUR ASSOCIATION FOR

01:14:24.193 --> 01:14:26.328
MILITARY SPOUSES AND CONNECTED

01:14:26.395 --> 01:14:28.831
WITH OVER TWELVE HUNDRED OTHER

01:14:28.897 --> 01:14:29.364
ATTORNEYS STRUGGLING TO

01:14:29.431 --> 01:14:31.233
MAINTAIN THEIR CAREERS. WE

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:33.001
BANDED TOGETHER TO ADVOCATE FOR

01:14:33.068 --> 01:14:34.937
CHANGES TO LICENSING RULES. AND

01:14:35.003 --> 01:14:36.138
I'M PROUD TO REPORT THE NUMBERS

01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:38.106
ACTUALLY THIRTY EIGHT SO THIS

01:14:38.173 --> 01:14:39.641
WAS US IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE

01:14:39.708 --> 01:14:41.476
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED. AND I'M

01:14:41.543 --> 01:14:42.411
HAPPY TO SAY THIS IS WHAT THE

01:14:42.477 --> 01:14:44.079
MAP LOOKS LIKE TODAY SO THERE

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:45.180
ARE NOW THIRTY EIGHT

01:14:45.247 --> 01:14:46.915
JURISDICTIONS. THAT HAVE SOME

01:14:46.982 --> 01:14:48.584
SORT OF LICENSING ACCOMMODATION

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:50.419
FOR A MILITARY SPOUSE ATTORNEY.

01:14:50.485 --> 01:14:52.254
AS OF MARCH TWENTY NINETEEN

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:54.957
THAT INCLUDES CALIFORNIA WHICH

01:14:55.023 --> 01:14:58.427
I WILL RETURN TO IN A MOMENT.

01:14:58.493 --> 01:14:59.461
NOW I RECOGNIZE THAT ATTORNEYS

01:14:59.528 --> 01:15:01.029
ARE NOT GENERALLY A SYMPATHETIC

01:15:01.096 --> 01:15:03.832
GROUP. BUT I DISCOVERED THAT

01:15:03.899 --> 01:15:05.067
THIS ISSUE IS MUCH GREATER THAN

01:15:05.133 --> 01:15:07.736
MY OWN EXPERIENCE. AS I THINK

01:15:07.803 --> 01:15:08.804
IT WAS REFERENCED ON THE

01:15:08.871 --> 01:15:11.006
PREVIOUS PANEL ALMOST 34% OF

01:15:11.073 --> 01:15:12.875
MILITARY SPOUSES REQUIRE A

01:15:12.941 --> 01:15:14.076
LICENSE TO WORK ACROSS THE

01:15:14.142 --> 01:15:16.478
PROFESSIONS. WHEN DONE RIGHT

01:15:16.545 --> 01:15:18.480
OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING BENEFITS

01:15:18.547 --> 01:15:20.816
BOTH WORKERS AND CONSUMERS.

01:15:20.883 --> 01:15:23.118
HOWEVER MY EXPERIENCE IS THE

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:27.055
CURRENT LICENSING RULES ARE.

01:15:27.122 --> 01:15:27.689
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT

01:15:27.756 --> 01:15:30.726
PROTECTIONIST AND NOT BASED ON

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:32.427
ACTUAL COMPETENCY TO PERFORM

01:15:32.494 --> 01:15:33.829
THE DUTIES OF THE ONE OF THE

01:15:33.896 --> 01:15:35.731
WORK. ON THE CONFUSING

01:15:35.797 --> 01:15:37.699
PATCHWORK OF RULES ALONG WITH

01:15:37.766 --> 01:15:38.967
THE TIME AND COST OF OBTAINING

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:41.270
A LICENSE WITH EACH MOVE OFTEN

01:15:41.336 --> 01:15:43.105
RESULTS IN A MILITARY SPOUSE

01:15:43.171 --> 01:15:44.439
SETTLING FOR UNLICENSED

01:15:44.506 --> 01:15:46.642
EMPLOYMENT OUTSIDE OF THEIR

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:48.477
EDUCATION AND SKILLS SIDE OR

01:15:48.543 --> 01:15:49.745
OPTING OUT OF THE WORK FORCE

01:15:49.811 --> 01:15:51.914
ENTIRELY. THIS CREATES

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:54.449
FINANCIAL AND EMOTIONAL STRESS

01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:56.051
AND INFLUENCES A FAMILY'S

01:15:56.118 --> 01:15:57.819
DECISION A IN THE MILITARY

01:15:57.886 --> 01:15:59.721
FACTORS THAT HER OUR MILITARY'S

01:15:59.788 --> 01:16:01.256
READINESS RETENTION AND

01:16:01.323 --> 01:16:03.625
RECRUITING. A SPOUSE'S ABILITY

01:16:03.692 --> 01:16:05.093
TO BUILD A MEANINGFUL CAREER IS

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.528
ALSO AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE

01:16:06.595 --> 01:16:07.863
VETERANS ABILITY CHAIRED

01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:10.332
TRANSITION FROM ACTIVE DUTY TO

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:13.168
CIVILIAN LIFE THIS IS WHY WE

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:15.103
FOUNDED MISSION LICENSE AND WE

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:16.738
HELP MILITARY SPOUSES NAVIGATE

01:16:16.805 --> 01:16:20.542
THESE ISSUES. OF THE TWO TWO

01:16:20.609 --> 01:16:21.543
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN LICENSE TO

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:22.344
WORK STUDY WHICH I INCLUDED A

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:25.847
LINK TO FROM THE INSTITUTE FOR

01:16:25.914 --> 01:16:27.115
JUSTICE FOUND THAT CALIFORNIA

01:16:27.182 --> 01:16:29.017
LICENSES SIXTY TWO LOW AND

01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:31.453
MODERATE INCOME. OCCUPATIONS

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.088
THE THIRD MOST IN THE COUNTRY

01:16:33.155 --> 01:16:34.890
ARIZONA AND CALIFORNIA WERE

01:16:34.957 --> 01:16:35.891
NAMED AS THE MOST WIDELY AN

01:16:35.958 --> 01:16:40.128
OWNER SLEE LICENSE STATES

01:16:40.195 --> 01:16:41.930
EARLIER THIS YEAR I DON'T KNOW

01:16:41.997 --> 01:16:42.931
FOLKS ARE AWARE BUT- TO BE BOLD

01:16:42.998 --> 01:16:44.166
ACTION. THE FIRST STATE TO

01:16:44.232 --> 01:16:45.867
IMPLEMENT UNIVERSAL

01:16:45.934 --> 01:16:49.237
OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING ERRORS

01:16:49.304 --> 01:16:51.273
ON HIS LICENSING BOARDS AND

RECOGNIZE OCCUPATIONAL LICENSES

01:16:57.245 --> 01:16:58.847
GRANTED IN OTHER STATES. SO

01:16:58.914 --> 01:17:01.616
WITH ALL OF THAT MIND UP FOR

01:17:01.683 --> 01:17:02.684
THREE COMMENDED TENS OUR STATE

01:17:02.751 --> 01:17:03.885
IS THE COMMITTEE FOR ECONOMIC

01:17:16.698 --> 01:17:17.466
TO PRACTICE LAW IN CALIFORNIA

01:17:17.532 --> 01:17:17.966
AS DISCUSSED CALIFORNIA

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:18.767

ONE POINT ONE EARLIER THIS YEAR.

01:17:20.435 --> 01:17:21.370
AND WELL WE ARE ENTHUSIASTIC

01:17:21.436 --> 01:17:22.337
ABOUT THAT PROGRESS THE NEW

01:17:22.404 --> 01:17:23.805
RULE IS INCREDIBLY PROBLEMATIC

01:17:23.872 --> 01:17:25.073
THE BURDENSOME SUPERVISION

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:26.742
REQUIREMENT UNNECESSARILY

01:17:26.808 --> 01:17:28.844
STIGMATIZES MILITARY SPOUSES BY

01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:30.579
TREATING THEM AS NO MORE THAN

01:17:30.645 --> 01:17:31.847
INTERNS REGARDLESS OF THE YEARS

01:17:31.913 --> 01:17:35.384
IN PRACTICE. A MILITARY SPOUSE

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:37.119
pWITH NO TIES TO THE TO THE AREA

01:17:37.185 --> 01:17:38.954
MUST FIND AN EMPLOYER WILLING

01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:40.055
TO SIGN A DECLARATION

01:17:40.122 --> 01:17:41.156
COMMITTING TO ASSUME

01:17:41.223 --> 01:17:43.091
PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR

01:17:43.158 --> 01:17:45.560
THEM THE EMPLOYER MUST APPROVE

01:17:45.627 --> 01:17:46.828
EACH AND EVERY QUARTER OR

01:17:46.895 --> 01:17:48.397

ALL PLEADINGS AND IN FACT ANY

DOCUMENTS SUBMITTED TO A THIRD

01:17:55.203 --> 01:17:56.204
PARTY WHICH I READ TO INCLUDE

01:17:56.271 --> 01:17:59.775
EVEN AN EMAIL. TO A THIRD PARTY

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:00.308
HAS TO BE APPROVED BY THAT

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:03.245
SUPERVISING ATTORNEY. IT'S

01:18:03.311 --> 01:18:04.913
UNCLEAR WHETHER ANOTHER STATE

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:06.848
SERVER SENATOR ROSS TO YOUR

01:18:06.915 --> 01:18:08.250
POINT ON THE TIME IN PRACTICE

01:18:08.316 --> 01:18:10.819
ISSUES I THINK THE QUESTION IS.

01:18:10.886 --> 01:18:13.255
WILL THE TIME SPENT PRACTICING

01:18:13.321 --> 01:18:14.756
UNDER THIS REGISTERED MILITARY

01:18:14.823 --> 01:18:17.225
SPOUSE RULE IN CALIFORNIA ALLOW

01:18:17.292 --> 01:18:18.994
A SPOUSE TO THAN WE'VE INTO

01:18:19.061 --> 01:18:20.829
ANOTHER STATE LIKE TEXAS THAT

01:18:20.896 --> 01:18:23.131
REQUIRES FIVE OUT OF SEVEN. OR

01:18:23.198 --> 01:18:26.201
WHATEVER THEIR YEAR IN PRACTICE

01:18:26.268 --> 01:18:26.802
TIME IN PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS

01:18:26.868 --> 01:18:29.071
ARE. IT BASED ON THE

01:18:29.137 --> 01:18:31.306
RESTRICTIONS OF THIS RULE THE

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:33.308
OTHER PROBLEM IS ALSO LOGISTICS

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:35.343
THE RULE STIGMATIZES SPOUSES BY

01:18:35.410 --> 01:18:36.778
FORCING THEM TO JOB HUNT

01:18:36.845 --> 01:18:38.747
WITHOUT THE LICENSE IN HAND TO

01:18:38.814 --> 01:18:39.648
BECAUSE THEY CANNOT GET THE

01:18:39.714 --> 01:18:41.750
LICENSE UNTIL THEY FIND. THE

01:18:41.817 --> 01:18:43.718
ATTORNEY TO SUPERVISE THEM

01:18:43.785 --> 01:18:45.287
MEANING A MILITARY SPOUSE IS

01:18:45.353 --> 01:18:46.688
LIKELY TO BE PASSED OVER BY

01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:48.056
EMPLOYERS FOR SOMEBODY WHO

01:18:48.123 --> 01:18:50.525
ALREADY HAS A LICENSE IN HAND.

01:18:50.592 --> 01:18:53.462
THESE CONCERNS WERE CONVEYED TO

01:18:53.528 --> 01:18:54.329
THE STATE BAR DURING THE PUBLIC

01:18:54.396 --> 01:18:56.231
COMMENT PERIOD LAST YEAR

01:18:56.298 --> 01:18:58.200
DESPITE RECEIVING THIRTY SEVEN

01:18:58.266 --> 01:19:00.302
COMMONS OPPOSING THE RULE OR

01:19:00.368 --> 01:19:01.837
PROPOSING AN ALTERNATIVE SUCH

01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:04.005
AS MENTORSHIP. I'M AN ONLY

01:19:04.072 --> 01:19:05.373
EIGHT COMMENTS IN FAVOR OF THE

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.642
RULE NO SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES

01:19:07.709 --> 01:19:08.777
WERE MADE PRIOR TO ITS

01:19:08.844 --> 01:19:12.013
ADOPTION. I HEARD THE NUMBERS

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.515
EARLIER IT SOUNDS LIKE THREE

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:14.749
SPOUSES HAVE APPLIED AND WE

01:19:14.816 --> 01:19:16.151
RECOGNIZE I THINK IT'S ONLY

01:19:16.218 --> 01:19:17.752
BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE MARCH

01:19:17.819 --> 01:19:19.387
FIRST BUT- THERE ARE A HUNDRED

01:19:19.454 --> 01:19:21.223
AND FIFTY. MILITARY SPOUSE

01:19:21.289 --> 01:19:23.592
JEANETTE WHAT NETWORK MEMBERS

01:19:23.658 --> 01:19:26.495
IN CALIFORNIA AND YOU KNOW

01:19:26.561 --> 01:19:28.797
ANECDOTAL ANECDOTALLY HEARING

01:19:28.864 --> 01:19:29.598
FROM OUR MEMBERS WE KNOW THAT

01:19:29.664 --> 01:19:32.667
SOME EVEN WITH EMPLOYERS WHO

01:19:32.734 --> 01:19:33.935
ALREADY HAVE THEM WORKING AS A

01:19:34.002 --> 01:19:36.438
CLERK ROLE HAVE SAID. WE ARE

01:19:36.505 --> 01:19:37.506
NOT WILLING TO TAKE ON THE

01:19:37.572 --> 01:19:39.574
BURDENS OF THIS RULE YOU ARE

01:19:39.641 --> 01:19:41.109
GOING TO HAVE TO SIT FOR THE

01:19:41.176 --> 01:19:42.444
BAR EXAM AND OTHERS ARE

01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:44.813
CONCERNED WITH THE TIME IN

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:46.414
PRACTICE IN BEING ABLE TO WEAVE

01:19:46.481 --> 01:19:49.451
INTO THE NEXT STATE. SO THEY

01:19:49.518 --> 01:19:53.655
ARE OPTING. TO SIT FOR THE BAR

01:19:53.722 --> 01:19:54.289
EXAM RATHER THAN UTILIZING THIS

01:19:54.356 --> 01:19:59.227
ROLE. PRESIDENT WE BELIEVE THAT

01:19:59.294 --> 01:20:00.462
LEGISLATIVE ACTION IS NECESSARY

01:20:00.529 --> 01:20:02.497
TO OBTAIN A MORE PRACTICAL RULE.

01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:03.431
AS REFERENCED EARLIER MSG AND

01:20:03.498 --> 01:20:05.033
HAS IT ADOPTED OR HAS DEVELOPED

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:05.634
A MODEL RULE FOR THE ADMISSION

01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:06.168
OF MILITARY SPOUSES THAT

01:20:06.234 --> 01:20:07.335
PROVIDES THE PUBLIC SAFETY

01:20:07.402 --> 01:20:08.303
PROTECTIONS WITHOUT

01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:10.138
UNNECESSARILY STIGMATIZING

01:20:10.205 --> 01:20:11.506
MILITARY SPOUSES SEEKING TO

01:20:11.573 --> 01:20:13.475
PRACTICE THE LAW. ON SOME OF

01:20:13.542 --> 01:20:15.310
THE THIRTY EIGHT JURISDICTIONS

01:20:15.377 --> 01:20:16.912
AND I WANTED TO CARESS I THINK

THE ARMS OF SECURING THAT SO

01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:56.203

MAKE THIS WORK. I THOUGHT FOR

01:38:12.286 --> 01:38:13.754
EXAMPLE IN THE SLIDE WITH

01:38:13.821 --> 01:38:16.357
RESPECT TO THE REGISTERED NURSE

01:38:16.423 --> 01:38:17.791
THE NURSE NURSES TAKEN NATIONAL

01:38:17.858 --> 01:38:21.762
EXAM OF THE- IN EXTRA NEXT TO

01:38:21.829 --> 01:38:22.796
SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT THEY

01:38:22.863 --> 01:38:24.331
TAKE COMING OUT OF A NURSING

01:38:24.398 --> 01:38:26.500
SCHOOL. IN ORDER TO GET THEIR

01:38:26.567 --> 01:38:28.068
LICENSE AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:38:28.135 --> 01:38:29.036
WHY THEY'RE SO MUCH OF A

01:38:29.103 --> 01:38:32.840
RIGMAROLE. GETTING THAT

01:38:32.906 --> 01:38:34.608
PARTICULAR PERSON IN THE

01:38:34.675 --> 01:38:36.977
CALIFORNIA AND IN A POSITION

01:38:37.044 --> 01:38:39.146
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT PLACES

01:38:39.213 --> 01:38:39.713
CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKERS MAN

01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:42.383
MAYBE YOU COULD SPEAK TO THAT.

01:38:42.449 --> 01:38:44.385
RIGHT SO RECENTLY IN THE PAST I

01:38:44.451 --> 01:38:46.353
BELIEVE TWO YEARS CALIFORNIA

01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:49.323
HAS ADOPTED THE NATIONAL EXAM

01:38:49.390 --> 01:38:51.925
HOWEVER. IF WE ARE GONNA OBTAIN

01:38:51.992 --> 01:38:53.560
OUR LICENSING CALIFORNIA WE DO

01:38:53.627 --> 01:38:55.629
NEED TO PROVIDE A LINE ETHICS

01:38:55.696 --> 01:38:58.599
EXAM WHICH SOME MIGHT ARGUE IS

01:38:58.666 --> 01:39:00.234
AS EQUALLY AS CHALLENGING AS

01:39:00.301 --> 01:39:02.670
THE BOARD EXAM AND IN MY CASE

01:39:02.736 --> 01:39:05.406
FOR EXAMPLE I PLAY I AM. YOU

01:39:05.472 --> 01:39:06.507
KNOW FAILING IS NOT AN OPTION

01:39:06.573 --> 01:39:08.709
IT'S WE ARE ON A TIME CRUNCH

01:39:08.776 --> 01:39:09.276
HERE AND SO I HAD TO PAY FOR

01:39:09.343 --> 01:39:12.479
COURSE. TO PASS THIS EXAM

01:39:12.546 --> 01:39:15.215
BECAUSE IT IS PRETTY RIGOROUS

01:39:15.282 --> 01:39:16.483
ACCORDING TO THE FEEDBACK

01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:18.686
PROVIDED BY OTHER LICENSED

01:39:18.752 --> 01:39:19.753
CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER SEVERITY

01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:21.588
OF THAT TAKING THE EXAM. SO

01:39:21.655 --> 01:39:22.156
WHILE THERE IS A NATIONALLY

01:39:22.222 --> 01:39:26.060
EXAM. ACROSS THE NATION

01:39:26.126 --> 01:39:27.561
CALIFORNIA HAS THEIR OWN

01:39:27.628 --> 01:39:29.029
STIPULATIONS AND THEIR OWN SET

01:39:29.096 --> 01:39:30.431
OF REQUIREMENTS THAT WE ALL

01:39:30.497 --> 01:39:33.300
HAVE TO ABIDE AND THERE IS.

01:39:33.367 --> 01:39:35.669
THERE IS NO CONSIDERATION TAKEN

01:39:35.736 --> 01:39:37.538
FOR MILITARY SPOUSES EXCEPT FOR

01:39:37.604 --> 01:39:38.572
THE FACT THAT IT WILL BE

01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:40.207
EXPEDITED AND EVEN IN THAT CASE

01:39:40.274 --> 01:39:42.776
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE WHAT'S

01:39:42.843 --> 01:39:44.411
AMAZING TO A LAW AND ETHICS

01:39:44.478 --> 01:39:45.946
EXAM VERY IMPORTANT I SUPPOSE

01:39:46.013 --> 01:39:47.581
WE NEED PEOPLE TO. UNDERSTAND

01:39:47.648 --> 01:39:48.449
WHAT THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS ARE

01:39:48.515 --> 01:39:50.084
AND CERTAINLY TO BE ETHICAL BUT

01:39:50.150 --> 01:39:51.318
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHY

01:39:51.385 --> 01:39:53.721
WE CAN'T MOVE PEOPLE INTO A

01:39:53.787 --> 01:39:56.824
POSITION AND ALLOW WORK TO BE

01:39:56.890 --> 01:39:58.192

ATTEMPTING TO DO HOWEVER

01:39:59.927 --> 01:40:01.328
IMPERFECT ARE PERFECT MAY BE

01:40:01.395 --> 01:40:02.996
WITH RESPECT TO LAWYERS. WHY WE

01:40:03.063 --> 01:40:04.298
CAN'T ALLOW THAT FOR LICENSED

01:40:04.365 --> 01:40:06.967
CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKERS AS THE

01:40:07.034 --> 01:40:09.002
REST OF THIS PROCESS CATCHES UP

01:40:09.069 --> 01:40:11.405

01:42:24.371 --> 01:42:25.606
RIGHT IN THE MIX OF FACT MAYBE

01:42:25.672 --> 01:42:27.007
EVEN HIGHER THAN THOSE ONES

01:42:27.074 --> 01:42:28.442
BECAUSE THIRDS HERE IS A

01:42:28.509 --> 01:42:29.943
SERVICE MEMBER WITH THE WORKING

01:42:30.010 --> 01:42:32.379
SPOUSE AND AT THAT AND AS OF

01:42:32.446 --> 01:42:34.515
YESTERDAY WE WERE TOLD THAT WAS

01:42:34.581 --> 01:42:35.782
NOT BUT THEY WERE NOT BEING

01:42:35.849 --> 01:42:36.917
ADMITTED TO THE ON BASE NOW

01:42:36.984 --> 01:42:38.018
THERE ARE OPTIONS TO GO OFF

01:42:38.085 --> 01:42:39.853
BASE AND SOME SUBSIDIES. WHICH

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:41.388
IS A WHOLE NOTHER ISSUE BUT

01:42:41.455 --> 01:42:42.422
CHILD CARE CERTAINLY COMES OF

01:42:42.489 --> 01:42:45.125
IT EVERY SPOUSE EMPLOYMENT

01:42:45.192 --> 01:42:48.195
DISCUSSION WE GO TO. SEE TO ME

01:42:48.262 --> 01:42:53.033
THAT WOULD BE IT WAS OUR. WELL

01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:53.600
I DON'T KNOW IT SEEMS TO ME

01:42:53.667 --> 01:42:54.234
THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER IMPORTANT

01:42:54.301 --> 01:42:54.801
PRIORITY FOR DO YOU NEED TO

01:42:54.868 --> 01:42:58.038
TAKE ON. YEAH I KNOW AND I MEAN

01:42:58.105 --> 01:42:58.872

01:42:59.573 --> 01:43:00.040
ASKING FOR CHANGES WHICH I

01:43:00.107 --> 01:43:01.575
THINK ARE APPROPRIATE. BUT I

01:43:01.642 --> 01:43:02.543
ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THE DOD

01:43:02.609 --> 01:43:05.112
IS DOING WHAT NEEDS TO DO. AND

01:43:05.178 --> 01:43:06.480
SOMETIMES FORGETS THESE THINGS

01:43:06.547 --> 01:43:08.882
IT SEEMS. HIS MERE CHILD CARE

01:43:08.949 --> 01:43:10.684
IS A IT IS DEFINITELY AN ISSUE

01:43:10.751 --> 01:43:13.287
BY. CHILD CARE CAN BE SOLVED

01:43:13.353 --> 01:43:16.690

ADDRESSED. AND SOME. IN A I

01:44:47.014 --> 01:44:48.515
JUST THINK IT'S ANOTHER THING

01:44:48.582 --> 01:44:49.650
FOR US TO BE KIND OF

01:44:49.716 --> 01:44:50.751
CONSIDERING BY THE WAY IF THERE

01:44:50.817 --> 01:44:52.919

CHILDHOOD EDUCATION

01:45:00.927 --> 01:45:03.664
INFRASTRUCTURE MIGHT EXIST ON

01:45:03.730 --> 01:45:06.166
THE BASIS THAT WE COULD HELP TO

01:45:06.233 --> 01:45:06.733
ASSIST WITH BY THE WITH THE

PROVIDERS WE GOT A LOOK INTO.

01:45:14.141 --> 01:45:17.711
THAT AS WELL. BECAUSE IN MOST

01:45:17.778 --> 01:45:19.112
SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO HAVE SOME

01:45:19.179 --> 01:45:21.214

01:45:26.219 --> 01:45:27.621
CONVERSATION HAPPENING THERE

01:45:27.688 --> 01:45:29.923
BUT YEAH MISTER I JUST WE

01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:32.059
SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT

01:45:32.125 --> 01:45:32.592
NOT ALL OF THESE MILITARY

01:45:32.659 --> 01:45:35.062
INSTALLATIONS. ARE FORTUNATE

01:45:35.128 --> 01:45:36.797
ENOUGH TO BE LOCATED IN URBAN

01:45:36.863 --> 01:45:39.566
AREAS LIKE I SAN DIEGO AND- IF

01:45:39.633 --> 01:45:40.333

LITERAL RIGHT. AND SO THE

01:45:50.043 --> 01:45:52.946
OPPORTUNITY TO IF THE IF THE

01:46:02.589 --> 01:46:03.890
THE MORE REASON WHY WE NEED TO

01:46:03.957 --> 01:46:06.226
HAVE BETTER FACILITIES ON BASS

01:46:06.293 --> 01:46:07.728

01:49:04.704 --> 01:49:05.171
THE END YOU SEE TRAINING

01:49:05.238 --> 01:49:06.673
EXPERIENCE AS AN INTENSE

01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:09.042
PROGRAM IT'S NOMINALLY TWENTY

01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.542
FOUR DAYS IN LENGTH BUT

01:49:09.609 --> 01:49:10.977
ACTUALLY MUCH LONGER FOR THE

01:49:11.044 --> 01:49:14.948
UNIT. THAT HAS. ASIAN AT THE

01:49:15.015 --> 01:49:18.852
CONCLUSION OF TRAINING. NTC IS

01:49:18.919 --> 01:49:20.921
TYPICALLY THE LAST EVENT IN THE

01:49:20.987 --> 01:49:21.454
TRAINING PROGRESSION THAT

01:49:21.521 --> 01:49:22.022
PREPARES UNITS FOR OVERSEAS

01:49:22.088 --> 01:49:24.424
DEPLOYMENT WE ARE THOROUGHLY

01:49:24.491 --> 01:49:26.559
FOCUSED ON MAKING UNITS BETTER

01:49:26.626 --> 01:49:27.694
IN THE ANY MISTAKES MADE OR

01:49:27.761 --> 01:49:29.195
WEAKNESSES IDENTIFIED RE

01:49:29.262 --> 01:49:31.831
MEDIATED AT AND T. C. RATHER

01:49:31.898 --> 01:49:32.465
THAN DOWN RANGE WHERE IT COUNTS

01:49:32.532 --> 01:49:34.701
FOR REAL. AS I MENTIONED

01:49:34.768 --> 01:49:35.936
TRAINING IS REALISTIC AND

01:49:36.002 --> 01:49:37.871
INTENSE SENIOR ARMY LEADERSHIP

01:49:37.938 --> 01:49:39.706
GAVE DIRECTION SOMETIME AGO TO

01:49:39.773 --> 01:49:41.074
MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE UNIT HAS

01:49:41.141 --> 01:49:43.009
QUOTE. A LIP QUIVERING

01:49:43.076 --> 01:49:48.315
EXPERIENCE WALLET NTC. WHATEVER

01:49:48.381 --> 01:49:48.915
WHAT BCT ARRIVES FOR TRAINING

01:49:48.982 --> 01:49:50.350
GOOD THING OR BAD THING. THAT'S

01:49:50.417 --> 01:49:54.120
A GOOD THING SIR. WHEN A BCT

01:49:54.187 --> 01:49:58.625
ARRIVES FOR TRAINING IT BRINGS

01:49:58.692 --> 01:49:59.225
FIVE THOUSAND TO SIX THOUSAND

01:49:59.292 --> 01:49:59.793
SOLDIERS AN APPROXIMATE TWO

01:49:59.859 --> 01:50:02.362
THOUSAND VEHICLES OUT TO T. AS YOU MAY EXPECT IN

01:50:02.429 --> 01:50:04.130
ORDER TO TRAINING UNIT OF THAT

01:50:04.197 --> 01:50:04.698
SIZE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

01:50:04.764 --> 01:50:07.934
LAND IS REQUIRED. FOR URBAN

01:50:08.001 --> 01:50:10.236
LOCATING THE HIGH MOJAVE DESERT

01:50:10.303 --> 01:50:10.870
SAND BURNED YOU KNOW COUNTY HAS

01:50:10.937 --> 01:50:13.306
AT LAND AVAILABLE. WE SAT ON

01:50:13.373 --> 01:50:15.208
OVER SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY

TWELVE HUNDRED SQUARE MILES.

01:50:18.011 --> 01:50:19.312
FOR PERSPECTIVE OUR TRAINING

01:50:19.379 --> 01:50:21.014
AREA IS APPROXIMATELY THE SAME

01:50:21.081 --> 01:50:21.548
SIZE AS THE STATE OF RHODE

01:50:21.614 --> 01:50:24.751
ISLAND. THIS ENVIRONMENT

01:50:24.818 --> 01:50:25.885
PROVIDES AN OPTIMAL TRAINING

01:50:25.952 --> 01:50:28.555
EXPERIENCE ARE REMOTENESS

01:50:28.621 --> 01:50:29.189
AMPLIFIES THE DIFFICULTIES ARMY

01:50:29.255 --> 01:50:32.292
FAMILIES EXPERIENCE. DIFFICULT

01:50:32.359 --> 01:50:34.494
ENOUGH FOR FREQUENT LOCATIONS A

01:50:34.561 --> 01:50:34.995
MOVE TO FORT URBAN ADDS

01:50:35.061 --> 01:50:37.197
COMPLEXITY TO THE SITUATION.

01:50:37.263 --> 01:50:38.932
THE NEAREST CITY IS BAR STYLE A

01:50:38.999 --> 01:50:40.800
SMALL AREA OF ONLY TWENTY FOUR

01:50:40.867 --> 01:50:42.102
THOUSAND RESIDENTS PROVIDING

01:50:42.168 --> 01:50:42.702
ONLY LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:50:42.769 --> 01:50:45.572
SOLDIERS AND THEIR FAMILIES.

01:50:45.638 --> 01:50:47.073
FORT IRWIN IS RECOGNIZED IN

01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:48.541
ARMY REGULATIONS AS A QUOTE

01:50:48.608 --> 01:50:51.044
REMOTE AND ISOLATED BASE ONE OF

01:50:51.111 --> 01:50:52.379
ONLY A FEW IN THE CONTINENTAL

01:50:52.445 --> 01:50:55.281
U. S. TO CARRY THAT DESIGNATION.

01:50:55.348 --> 01:50:56.649
BECAUSE OF THIS THE FOR URBAN

01:50:56.716 --> 01:50:59.119
LEADERSHIP IS KEENLY AWARE THAT

01:50:59.185 --> 01:51:00.487
WE MUST PROVIDE A WELCOME

01:51:00.553 --> 01:51:01.788
EXPERIENCE FOR THE SOLDIER AND

01:51:01.855 --> 01:51:03.623
HIS OR HER FAMILY. THE BETTER

01:51:03.690 --> 01:51:05.291
INSULATION IS TRULY THEIR

01:51:05.358 --> 01:51:05.925
HOMETOWN COMMUNITY DURING THEIR

01:51:05.992 --> 01:51:09.429
TOUR. I SAY ALL THIS TO GIVE

01:51:09.496 --> 01:51:12.098
CONTEXT TO THE DISCUSSION IN

01:51:12.165 --> 01:51:13.299
NEXT TEMP TO FRAME THE CURRENT

01:51:13.366 --> 01:51:15.468
SITUATION FOR THE TYPICAL ARMY

01:51:15.535 --> 01:51:18.038
SPOUSE IN REGARDS TO EMPLOYMENT.

01:51:18.104 --> 01:51:19.506
ACCORDING TO THE US COUNCIL OF

01:51:19.572 --> 01:51:21.307
ECONOMIC ADVISERS THE TYPICAL

01:51:21.374 --> 01:51:23.309
MILITARY SPOUSE HAS MORE

01:51:23.376 --> 01:51:23.810
EDUCATION IN THE OVERALL

01:51:23.877 --> 01:51:27.247
CIVILIAN POPULATION. AROUND 40%

01:51:27.313 --> 01:51:28.581
HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE IN NEARLY

01:51:28.648 --> 01:51:32.085
75% HAVE SOME COLLEGE. THIS

01:51:32.152 --> 01:51:33.153
CONTRASTS WITH THE CIVILIAN

01:51:33.219 --> 01:51:36.556
POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY 30%

01:51:36.623 --> 01:51:37.123
WITH THE DEGREE AND ONLY 55%

01:51:37.190 --> 01:51:40.126
WITH SOME COLLEGE. DESPITE THIS

01:51:40.193 --> 01:51:41.594
HIGHER LEVEL OF EDUCATION

01:51:41.661 --> 01:51:43.396
MILITARY SPOUSES ARE LESS

01:51:43.463 --> 01:51:45.465
LIKELY TO BE IN THE LABOR FORCE

01:51:45.532 --> 01:51:46.032
WHEN THE GENERAL WORKING AGE

01:51:46.099 --> 01:51:50.670
POPULATION. 57% AS COMPARED

01:51:50.737 --> 01:51:51.171
276% ACCORDING TO A TWO

01:51:51.237 --> 01:51:54.140
THOUSAND SIXTEEN SURVEY. GIVEN

01:51:54.207 --> 01:51:55.775
THAT LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION

01:51:55.842 --> 01:51:57.077
TYPICALLY INCREASES WITH THE

01:51:57.143 --> 01:51:58.912
LEVEL OF EDUCATION THE

01:51:58.978 --> 01:51:59.512
DIFFERENCE IS ACTUALLY GREATER

01:51:59.579 --> 01:52:02.782
THAN THOSE NUMBERS INDICATE.

01:52:02.849 --> 01:52:03.983
FOR THE MILITARY SPOUSE THAT

01:52:04.050 --> 01:52:05.385
SPOUSES THAT ARE IN THE LABOR

01:52:05.452 --> 01:52:07.821
FORCE THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT RATE

01:52:07.887 --> 01:52:08.388
IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN

01:52:08.455 --> 01:52:11.624
THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. THE EXACT

01:52:11.691 --> 01:52:13.426
RATE IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE

01:52:13.493 --> 01:52:14.828
AS BEST MEN'S RANGE FROM A LOW

01:52:14.894 --> 01:52:18.665
OF ONLY 10% TO A HIGH OF 24%

01:52:18.731 --> 01:52:20.233
GIVEN THAT THE OVERALL

01:52:20.300 --> 01:52:21.134
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS CURRENTLY

01:52:21.201 --> 01:52:23.937
LESS THAN 4% THERE'S NO DOUBT

01:52:24.003 --> 01:52:25.238
THAT IS MUCH HIGHER FOR THE

01:52:25.305 --> 01:52:25.839
MILITARY SPOUSE COMMUNITY THEN

01:52:25.905 --> 01:52:28.208
FOR THE AVERAGE AMERICAN. THE

01:52:28.274 --> 01:52:28.775
REASONS BEHIND THESE NUMBERS

01:52:28.842 --> 01:52:32.312
ARE MARRIED. MANY MILITARY

01:52:32.378 --> 01:52:32.912
SPOUSES CLAIM THEY CANNOT FIND

01:52:32.979 --> 01:52:36.816
RELIABLE CHILDCARE. HOWEVER IN

01:52:36.883 --> 01:52:38.451
MANY CASES THE REASON IS DUE TO

01:52:38.518 --> 01:52:39.419
THE POOR OUTLOOK FOR THE

01:52:39.486 --> 01:52:39.986
MILITARY SPOUSE LOOKING FOR

01:52:40.053 --> 01:52:43.490
EMPLOYMENT. MILITARY SPOUSES

01:52:43.556 --> 01:52:44.824
FACE TO FACE UNIQUE CHALLENGES

01:52:44.891 --> 01:52:45.325
WHEN IT COMES TO FINDING

01:52:45.391 --> 01:52:48.595
EMPLOYMENT. FREQUENT RELOCATION

01:52:48.661 --> 01:52:49.929
EVERY TWO TO THREE YEARS ON

01:52:49.996 --> 01:52:51.397
AVERAGE MEANS THAT THERE ARE

01:52:51.464 --> 01:52:52.765
LIKELY TO BE GAPS IN THEIR

01:52:52.832 --> 01:52:54.334
RESUMES ALONG WITH NUMEROUS

01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:57.270
JOBS HELD WE SHORT TENURES. IF

01:52:57.337 --> 01:52:58.505
NOT SCREENED OUT WITHOUT EVEN

01:52:58.571 --> 01:53:00.206
AN INTERVIEW SPOUSES ARE OFTEN

01:53:00.273 --> 01:53:02.675
ASK QUESTIONS SUCH AS- WHY HAVE

01:53:02.742 --> 01:53:04.177
YOU MOVED AROUND SO MUCH FOR

01:53:04.244 --> 01:53:06.913
WHEN WILL YOU MOVE AGAIN.

01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:08.948
CREATING CONSCIOUS OR NOT A

01:53:09.015 --> 01:53:09.516
BIAS AGAINST HIRING MILITARY

01:53:09.582 --> 01:53:13.119
SPOUSES. EMPLOYERS FIELD THE

01:53:13.186 --> 01:53:14.554
SPOUSE CAN MOVE AGAIN ON SHORT

01:53:14.621 --> 01:53:15.922
NOTICE AND THEY'RE NOT WILLING

01:53:15.989 --> 01:53:19.926
TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT NOW. THE

01:53:19.993 --> 01:53:21.394
RESULT IS THAT IN ADDITION TO

01:53:21.461 --> 01:53:22.729
LOW LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION

01:53:22.795 --> 01:53:25.398
AND HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT. MORE

01:53:25.465 --> 01:53:26.866
THAN HALF OF THE MILITARY

01:53:26.933 --> 01:53:28.601
SPOUSES WHO ARE WORKING SAY

01:53:28.668 --> 01:53:29.169
THEY ARE IN A POSITION THAT

01:53:29.235 --> 01:53:31.571
THEY ARE OVER QUALIFIED FOR AND

01:53:31.638 --> 01:53:33.439
AS A RESULT THE TYPICAL

01:53:33.506 --> 01:53:36.209
MILITARY SPOUSE EARNS 26% LESS

01:53:36.276 --> 01:53:38.344
THAN THEIR NON MILITARY PEERS.

01:53:38.411 --> 01:53:40.780
A DIFFERENCE OF MORE THAN TEN

01:53:40.847 --> 01:53:41.314
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IN

01:53:41.381 --> 01:53:41.915
INCOME LOSS TO THOSE MILITARY

01:53:41.981 --> 01:53:45.151
FAMILIES. THERE IS AN

01:53:45.218 --> 01:53:46.519
ADDITIONAL FATE ISSUE FACING

01:53:46.586 --> 01:53:48.054
MILITARY SPOUSES AS A SEEK

01:53:48.121 --> 01:53:48.688
EMPLOYMENT THAT I WANT TO FOCUS

01:53:48.755 --> 01:53:51.224
ON FOR A MOMENT. OF THE

01:53:51.291 --> 01:53:52.825
MILITARY SPOUSES WHO DO WORK

01:53:52.892 --> 01:53:54.627
NEARLY 35% REQUIRE PROFESSIONAL

01:53:54.694 --> 01:53:57.096
LICENSE TO MAINTAIN THEIR

01:53:57.163 --> 01:53:58.231
STATUS IN ABILITY TO WORK IN

01:53:58.298 --> 01:53:59.866
THEIR CHOSEN CAREER FIELD.

01:53:59.933 --> 01:54:01.467
INCLUDING A PRICE WE 19% IN THE

01:54:01.534 --> 01:54:03.203
HEALTHCARE FIELD AND

01:54:03.269 --> 01:54:03.703
APPROXIMATELY 10% IN THE

01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:06.539
EDUCATION FIELD. SIGNIFICANTLY

01:54:06.606 --> 01:54:08.474
THOSE LIGHTS IS OFTEN DO NOT

01:54:08.541 --> 01:54:10.843
TRANSFER ACROSS STATE LINES. A

01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:12.512
MAJOR ISSUE CONSIDER THAT A

01:54:12.579 --> 01:54:13.546
MILITARY FAMILY IS

01:54:13.613 --> 01:54:15.348
APPROXIMATELY TEN TIMES MORE

01:54:15.415 --> 01:54:16.883
LIKELY TO MOVE ACROSS STATE

01:54:16.950 --> 01:54:17.450
LINES THAT ARE NON MILITARY

01:54:17.517 --> 01:54:20.787
FAMILY. I'LL GIVE A REAL LIFE

01:54:20.853 --> 01:54:21.354
EXAMPLE OF WHAT THIS USED TO

01:54:21.421 --> 01:54:25.525
MEAN. THERE'S A SPOUSE OF A

01:54:25.592 --> 01:54:26.159
SOLDIER CURRENTLY AT FORT OR IN

01:54:26.226 --> 01:54:28.861
WHO WORKS AS A SCHOOL TEACHER.

01:54:28.928 --> 01:54:29.629
UPON THAT FAMILIES INITIAL

01:54:29.696 --> 01:54:31.231
POTION TO BORDER ON SOME YEARS

01:54:31.297 --> 01:54:32.732
AGO. SHE WENT THROUGH THE

01:54:32.799 --> 01:54:33.366
PROCESS OF OBTAINING A

01:54:33.433 --> 01:54:35.768
CALIFORNIA TEACHER CREDENTIAL A

01:54:35.835 --> 01:54:36.369
PROCESS THAT INVOLVES MULTIPLE

01:54:36.436 --> 01:54:38.871
TESTS OTHER REQUIREMENTS.

01:54:38.938 --> 01:54:40.139
SUBSEQUENTLY SHE LEFT THE STATE

01:54:40.206 --> 01:54:40.673
HER HUSBAND WAS POSTED TO

01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:43.810
DIFFERENT INSTALLATION. SHE

01:54:43.876 --> 01:54:44.544
WENT ABOUT A CHENEY TEACHER

01:54:44.611 --> 01:54:45.979
CREDENTIAL IN THAT STATE AND

01:54:46.045 --> 01:54:46.579
LET HER CALIFORNIA CREDENTIAL

01:54:46.646 --> 01:54:50.516
EXPIRE. AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT

01:54:50.583 --> 01:54:51.150
AFTER SOME OTHER TOWARDS A DUTY

01:54:51.217 --> 01:54:51.751
THE FAMILY RETURNED AFFORD OR

01:54:51.818 --> 01:54:54.354
WHEN. SINCE SHE A LETTER

01:54:54.420 --> 01:54:55.288
CREDENTIAL THAT SHE HAD TO GO

01:54:55.355 --> 01:54:56.422
THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS

01:54:56.489 --> 01:54:58.658
AGAIN. TAKING MULTIPLE TASKS

01:54:58.725 --> 01:54:59.225
AND SPENDING OVER A THOUSAND

01:54:59.292 --> 01:55:01.761
DOLLARS TO GET RE CERTIFIED.

01:55:01.828 --> 01:55:03.363
CURRENTLY TO ENSURE TO SHE DOES

01:55:03.429 --> 01:55:04.998
NOT HAVE TO REPEAT THIS PROCESS

01:55:05.064 --> 01:55:07.433
EVER AGAIN SHE NOW MAINTAINS

01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:08.801
CURRENT TEACHING CREDENTIALS IN

01:55:08.868 --> 01:55:11.638
FOUR DIFFERENT STATES. JUST IN

01:55:11.704 --> 01:55:12.272
CASE HER HUSBAND'S CAREER TAKES

01:55:12.338 --> 01:55:12.805
HER TO ONE OF THOSE PLACES

01:55:12.872 --> 01:55:15.308
AGAIN. OF COURSE THIS WILL NOT

01:55:15.375 --> 01:55:17.310
HELP IF HE GETS AN ASSIGNMENT

01:55:17.377 --> 01:55:17.877
IN THE STATE WHERE THEY HAVE

01:55:17.944 --> 01:55:21.147
NOT LIVED BEFORE. FOR URBAN

01:55:21.214 --> 01:55:22.982
REMOTE INSTALLATION THERE ARE

01:55:23.049 --> 01:55:25.218
FOUR SCHOOLS ON BOARD THE BASS.

01:55:25.285 --> 01:55:26.286
NOTED THESE ARE NOT DIFFER

01:55:26.352 --> 01:55:27.720
PARTNER DIFFERENT SCHOOLS

01:55:27.787 --> 01:55:29.822
RATHER DISTRICT IN STATE
