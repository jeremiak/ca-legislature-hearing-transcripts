SINCE THEN -- CAL FIRE HAS

00:40:41.505 --> 00:40:43.107
LEARNED OTHER PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

00:40:43.174 --> 00:40:45.176
COST INCREASE ON THAT CHIP

00:40:45.242 --> 00:40:46.944
RELEASE THAT IS BASED ON THE

00:40:47.011 --> 00:40:48.646
CHANGE IN THE SCOPE OF THE

00:40:48.712 --> 00:40:49.947
CONSTRUCTION PROJECT.

00:40:50.014 --> 00:40:51.382
THAT IS ESSENTIALLY ABOUT

00:40:51.448 --> 00:40:53.117
DOUBLING THE CONSTRUCTION COST

00:40:53.184 --> 00:40:54.518
FROM WHAT YOU HEARD JUST A

00:40:54.585 --> 00:40:56.420
COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO -- THAT

00:40:56.487 --> 00:40:58.856
TYPICALLY WHEN AT APARTMENT WELL

00:40:58.923 --> 00:41:01.425
BE FACED WITH A CHANGE IN SCOPE

00:41:01.492 --> 00:41:02.860
OR SOMETHING VERY UNEXPECTED

00:41:02.927 --> 00:41:04.328
ESPECIALLY OF THIS MAGNITUDE.

00:41:04.395 --> 00:41:06.230
AND THEY WILL OFTEN GO BACK AND

00:41:06.297 --> 00:41:08.032
LOOK FOR WAYS TO MITIGATE THOSE

00:41:08.098 --> 00:41:10.401
COSTS AND ENSURE THAT THE

00:41:10.467 --> 00:41:12.102
KALEIDOSCOPE CHANGES REALLY

00:41:12.169 --> 00:41:13.404
FULLY NECESSARY.

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:15.239
AND AND LOOK FOR MAYBE OTHER

00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:16.507
VALUE ENGINEERING OR THINGS TO

00:41:16.574 --> 00:41:18.008
TO BRING THE COST DOWN BEFORE

00:41:18.075 --> 00:41:19.076
THEY COME FORWARD.

00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:21.111
GIVEN THE TIMING OF WHEN CAL

00:41:21.178 --> 00:41:23.681
FIRE AT LEARNED ABOUT THE ISSUES

00:41:23.747 --> 00:41:25.482
THAT HAVE RESULTED IN THIS

00:41:25.549 --> 00:41:26.150
REQUEST.

00:41:26.217 --> 00:41:28.385
AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO

00:41:28.452 --> 00:41:30.621
GO THROUGH AND DO THAT TYPE OF

00:41:30.688 --> 00:41:32.156
BACK AND FORTH I'M ON THE

00:41:32.223 --> 00:41:34.291
PROJECT TO TRY TO MITIGATE THE

00:41:34.358 --> 00:41:35.159
COST INCREASE.

00:41:35.226 --> 00:41:36.927
I AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT WE

00:41:36.994 --> 00:41:39.430
WOULD RECOMMEND APPROVING AT

00:41:39.496 --> 00:41:41.498
THAT FUNDING AND IN JANUARY AND

00:41:41.565 --> 00:41:43.200
THE APRIL INCREASE FOR THE

00:41:43.267 --> 00:41:43.901
PROJECT.

00:41:43.968 --> 00:41:45.836
BY ADDING BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE

00:41:45.903 --> 00:41:48.105
PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE -- TO ONLY

00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:50.241
ALLOW CAL FIRE TO ACCESS THIS

00:41:50.307 --> 00:41:52.109
PIECE OF THE FUNDING -- AFTER

00:41:52.176 --> 00:41:54.311
THEY HAVE COMPLETED THAT WORK OF

00:41:54.378 --> 00:41:56.881
GOING BACK AND LOOKING AT AND

00:41:56.947 --> 00:41:58.215
HOW THEY CAN POTENTIALLY

00:41:58.282 --> 00:42:00.217
MITIGATE THE COST INCREASE ON

00:42:00.284 --> 00:42:01.151
THAT I KNOW THAT SOMETHING TO MY

00:42:01.218 --> 00:42:01.986
UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY ARE

00:42:02.052 --> 00:42:04.121
CURRENTLY WORKING ON AND THEY

00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:05.556
JUST HAVEN'T HAD THE TIME GIVEN

00:42:05.623 --> 00:42:06.891
THE TIMING OF WHEN THEY LEARNED

00:42:06.957 --> 00:42:07.124
ABOUT.

00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:09.326
THE COST INCREASE SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:42:09.393 --> 00:42:10.527
AND THE MAJORITY OF THIS COST

00:42:10.594 --> 00:42:12.463
INCREASES RELATED TO A VERY

00:42:12.529 --> 00:42:19.169
LARGE WATER TANK.

00:42:19.236 --> 00:42:20.804
THAT WILL HAVE TO HE ADDED TO

00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:22.306
THE PROJECT ON AND SO THE SIZE

00:42:22.373 --> 00:42:22.973
OF THAT WATER TANK IS SOMEONE IN

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:23.908
QUESTION BECAUSE THERE'S OTHER

00:42:23.974 --> 00:42:24.875
FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES THAT THEY

00:42:24.942 --> 00:42:25.442
HAVE AVAILABLE AT THIS CAMP

00:42:25.509 --> 00:42:27.411
THERE IS A FIRE TRUCK AND THAT'S

00:42:27.478 --> 00:42:28.078
ON SITE AND A FIRE STATION THAT

00:42:28.145 --> 00:42:29.013
IS NEARBY.

00:42:29.079 --> 00:42:31.048
AND SO AS THEY TAKE THOSE THINGS

00:42:31.115 --> 00:42:32.650
INTO CONSIDERATION THAT COULD

00:42:32.716 --> 00:42:34.285
HELP OFFSET SOME OF THAT THE

00:42:34.351 --> 00:42:35.853
SCOPE CHANGE THAT IS INCLUDED

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.321
HERE AND THIS IS SORT OF THE

00:42:37.388 --> 00:42:38.522
FULL MAGNITUDE OF IT.

00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:39.790
AND SO IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT

00:42:39.857 --> 00:42:41.859
THEY CONTINUE THESE EFFORTS TO

00:42:41.926 --> 00:42:43.394
REALLY TRY TO GET THE COST BACK

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:45.796
DOWN WE WOULD RECOMMEND ADDING

00:42:45.863 --> 00:42:48.699
THAT PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE.

00:42:48.766 --> 00:42:50.634
THANK YOU DOES -- DEPARTMENT

FANS HAVE ANY COMMENTS ENTER

00:42:52.569 --> 00:42:53.370
SHARP FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:42:53.437 --> 00:42:54.271
I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT THAT

00:42:54.338 --> 00:42:56.073
THE STANDARD CAPITAL A PROCESS

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.541
IS AS WE GO THROUGH.

00:42:57.608 --> 00:42:58.709
THE WORKING DRAWINGS AND DESIGN

00:42:58.776 --> 00:43:02.513
IF WE DO FIND EFFICIENCIES --

00:43:02.579 --> 00:43:03.781
THOSE FUNDS FOR THE CAPITAL

00:43:03.847 --> 00:43:05.349
PROJECT TO REVERT BACK TO THE

00:43:05.416 --> 00:43:06.517
FINE FOR WHICH THEY WERE

00:43:06.583 --> 00:43:08.752
ORIGINATED IN WE WOULD COMMIT TO

00:43:08.819 --> 00:43:10.321
DOING THAT AB IF WE FOUND

00:43:10.387 --> 00:43:11.989
EFFICIENCIES TO REVERT.

00:43:12.056 --> 00:43:13.390
THE FUNDS BACK THAT IS STANDARD

00:43:13.457 --> 00:43:14.391
PRACTICE.

00:43:14.458 --> 00:43:16.393
HOWEVER -- I DID WANT TO SAY YOU

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:17.194
KNOW I'VE BEEN IN CLOSE

00:43:17.261 --> 00:43:19.463
COMMUNICATION WITH LA -- AND IF

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:21.899
IT'S A LEGISLATORS LEGISLATIVE

00:43:21.966 --> 00:43:22.967
PURVIEW TO ADD BUDGET BILL

00:43:23.033 --> 00:43:24.935
LANGUAGE I THINK THAT WE COULD

00:43:25.002 --> 00:43:27.237
WORK ON SOMETHING SO -- IT'S NOT

00:43:27.304 --> 00:43:31.442
A PREFERENCE BUT I THINK WE

00:43:31.508 --> 00:43:31.976
COULD WORK ON SOMETHING IF

00:43:32.042 --> 00:43:36.714
NECESSARY -- OKAY.

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:37.581
THE QUESTIONS SIR COMMENTS ON

00:43:37.648 --> 00:43:40.517
THIS ITEM.

00:43:40.584 --> 00:43:42.186
PLEASE THIS RACE.

00:43:42.252 --> 00:43:44.088
SO IT IS I UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE

00:43:44.154 --> 00:43:46.523
DO REQUEST PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:51.395
THEN -- THE THE MINISTRATION AND

00:43:51.462 --> 00:43:52.296
PUBLIC FINANCE IN LA -- WOULD

00:43:52.363 --> 00:43:54.031
WORK ON THE LANGUAGE.

00:43:54.098 --> 00:43:55.799
YES I I THINK THAT'S ACCEPTABLE

00:43:55.866 --> 00:43:57.701
PER CONVERSATIONS I THINK WE

00:43:57.768 --> 00:43:58.302
COULD WORK ON SOMETHING THAT

00:43:58.369 --> 00:44:00.304
DOESN'T HAMPER THE PROJECT IF

00:44:00.371 --> 00:44:02.139
THE LEGISLATIVE LEGISLATURE FELT

00:44:02.206 --> 00:44:03.407
THAT WAS NECESSARY WONDERFUL

00:44:03.474 --> 00:44:04.441
THANK YOU.

00:44:04.508 --> 00:44:05.142
IF I COULD SUMMARIZE LA --

00:44:05.209 --> 00:44:06.310
THINKS WE SHOULD DO PROVISIONAL

00:44:06.377 --> 00:44:07.611
LANGUAGE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:44:07.678 --> 00:44:09.346
AS WE'RE GONNA DO THAT ANYWAY

00:44:09.413 --> 00:44:11.582
IT'S REALLY NOT NECESSARY BUT WE

00:44:11.648 --> 00:44:13.183
COULD DO IT -- I THINK MY

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:15.886
PREFERENCE -- IS ALWAYS TO HAVE

00:44:15.953 --> 00:44:17.121
SOME YOU KNOW BELTS AND

00:44:17.187 --> 00:44:18.022
SUSPENDERS.

00:44:18.088 --> 00:44:21.091
BUILT INTO THE PROCESS -- AND I

00:44:21.158 --> 00:44:22.393
THINK EVERYBODY'S MORE LESS ON

00:44:22.459 --> 00:44:23.961
THE SAME PAGE I PREFER TO HAVE

00:44:24.028 --> 00:44:26.230
THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE HI

00:44:26.296 --> 00:44:29.066
THERE -- BUT CERTAINLY DOESN'T

00:44:29.133 --> 00:44:35.639
HURT -- SO DO WE NEED -- TO CAN

00:44:35.706 --> 00:44:38.776
WE CAN WE APPROVE IT.

00:44:38.842 --> 00:44:40.044
TO THIS BUDGET WITH PROVISIONAL.

00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:41.245
OKAY -- SO WHEN WE GET TO

00:44:41.311 --> 00:44:44.348
MOTIONS -- I THINK.

00:44:44.415 --> 00:44:45.749
I WILL DO PUBLIC COMMENT --

00:44:45.816 --> 00:44:46.984
AFTER ISSUE THREE AND THEN WE'LL

00:44:47.051 --> 00:44:48.085
JUST TO A SERIES OF WELL TO BE

00:44:48.152 --> 00:44:49.553
TO MOTIONS BECAUSE NUMBER THREE

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:52.256
IS -- IS A HOLD OPEN.

00:44:52.322 --> 00:44:54.191
HI BUT WILL -- ASK FOR THAT --

00:44:54.258 --> 00:44:56.593
WITH THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:56.894
[inaudible]

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.530
ISSUE.

00:44:59.596 --> 00:45:00.664
TWO VERY GOOD.

00:45:00.731 --> 00:45:02.466
ISSUE.

00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:04.201
TWO CALPERS REQUESTING SEVEN

00:45:04.268 --> 00:45:07.037
POINT THREE FOUR THREE MILLION.

00:45:07.104 --> 00:45:09.406
DOLLARS AND RELEASED REVENUE IN

00:45:09.473 --> 00:45:11.375
LEASE REVENUE BONDS -- FOR

00:45:11.442 --> 00:45:14.044
ADDITIONAL -- COSTS FOR

00:45:14.111 --> 00:45:15.746
CONSTRUCTION OF A CONSTRUCTION

00:45:15.813 --> 00:45:18.148
FUNDING RELATED TO THE SAN

00:45:18.215 --> 00:45:21.819
MATTEO SANTA CRUZ -- AUTO SHOP --

00:45:21.885 --> 00:45:27.624
AND THAT -- CONSTRUCTION PHASE

00:45:27.691 --> 00:45:30.527
COST IT WAS UNFORTUNATELY --

00:45:30.594 --> 00:45:33.964
ANOTHER ONE OF THESE -- AS WE

00:45:34.031 --> 00:45:35.999
LOOKED AT IT FURTHER -- AND THE

00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:38.602
AT AND AND AND ANALYZED THE

00:45:38.669 --> 00:45:40.838
COSTS GOING FORWARD -- THE

00:45:40.904 --> 00:45:43.507
THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE --

00:45:43.574 --> 00:45:47.945
DUE -- TO THE AREA OF WHICH THIS

00:45:48.011 --> 00:45:50.013
IS IS HAPPENING IN SANTA CRUZ

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.349
COUNTY -- CONSTRUCTION COSTS ARE

00:45:52.416 --> 00:45:54.084
MORE THAN WHEN THIS WAS FIRST

00:45:54.151 --> 00:46:00.891
SCOPED -- THE SOME OF THE ITEMS

00:46:00.958 --> 00:46:03.160
THAT ARE ATTACHED TO THIS

00:46:03.227 --> 00:46:05.229
INCLUDING THE FIRE SYSTEM --

00:46:05.295 --> 00:46:08.432
WATER -- TANK -- ARE ALSO

00:46:08.499 --> 00:46:10.000
INCREASING IN COSTS.

00:46:10.067 --> 00:46:13.303
THE MATERIALS -- AS THIS WAS

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:16.273
SCOPE A LONG TIME BACK -- AND

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:18.275
THE ANTICIPATED COST OF THOSE

00:46:18.342 --> 00:46:22.012
HAVE INCREASED AS WELL AS THE

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:24.515
CONSTRUCTION CONTINGENCY THAT'S

00:46:24.581 --> 00:46:26.416
ATTACHED TO ALL OF THAT.

00:46:26.483 --> 00:46:31.788
AND IN CONCLUSION THAT'S ISSUE.

00:46:31.855 --> 00:46:32.856
TWO THANK YOU MISS PETERS

00:46:32.923 --> 00:46:33.724
SENDING COMMENTS.

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:35.092
SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC

00:46:35.159 --> 00:46:36.460
RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS ONE BUT

00:46:36.527 --> 00:46:37.895
JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THIS IS A

00:46:37.961 --> 00:46:40.197
VERY SIGNIFICANT COST INCREASE --

00:46:40.264 --> 00:46:41.665
FROM WHAT THE PROJECT WAS

00:46:41.732 --> 00:46:43.600
ESTIMATED TO BE WHEN IT WENT OUT

00:46:43.667 --> 00:46:45.068
TO BED AND THEN THE BIDS COMING

00:46:45.135 --> 00:46:47.337
BACK ON THE PROJECT ALL OF THEM.

00:46:47.404 --> 00:46:49.206
ON THE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THE

00:46:49.273 --> 00:46:51.375
LOWEST ONE WAS AND IT'S ABOUT

00:46:51.441 --> 00:46:53.410
SIXTY SEVEN CLOSE 270% ABOVE

00:46:53.477 --> 00:46:55.646
WHAT THE ESTIMATE WISE AND SO

00:46:55.712 --> 00:46:57.014
FOR US AND THERE'S THERE'S NOT A

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.683
WHOLE LOT AT THIS POINT GIVEN

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:01.084
THE STAGE THE PROJECT IS THEN.

00:47:01.151 --> 00:47:02.452
AND THAT WE THINK YOU CAN REALLY

00:47:02.519 --> 00:47:04.154
DO ON THIS PROJECT SHORT OF YOU

00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:05.355
KNOW MAYBE DECIDING TO NOT GO

00:47:05.422 --> 00:47:06.023
FORWARD WITH IT WHICH WERE NOT

00:47:06.089 --> 00:47:07.658
RECOMMENDING BUT IT DOES RAISE

00:47:07.724 --> 00:47:09.126
SOME GOOD OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS

00:47:09.193 --> 00:47:11.528
AND ISSUES FOR YOU IN TERMS OF

00:47:11.595 --> 00:47:14.531
HOW CAL FIRE IS WORKING.

00:47:14.598 --> 00:47:16.300
WITH THE D. G. S. ON MANAGING

00:47:16.366 --> 00:47:17.734
ITS PROJECTS -- OUR

00:47:17.801 --> 00:47:19.469
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT PART OF

00:47:19.536 --> 00:47:21.371
THE GENESIS FOR THIS ISSUE IS

00:47:21.438 --> 00:47:23.240
THAT TIME CAL FIRE INDEED YES

00:47:23.307 --> 00:47:25.375
HAD TAKEN THE PLANS FROM ANOTHER

00:47:25.442 --> 00:47:26.777
SIMILAR PROJECT.

00:47:26.843 --> 00:47:28.345
AND TAKE IN THE ESTIMATE FROM

00:47:28.412 --> 00:47:30.147
THAT PROJECT AND DECIDED OKAY

00:47:30.214 --> 00:47:31.248
WE'RE GONNA JUST REUSE THOSE

00:47:31.315 --> 00:47:33.517
SAME PLANS AND THEY RE USE THAT

00:47:33.584 --> 00:47:35.385
SAME ESTIMATE AND IT SOUNDS LIKE

00:47:35.452 --> 00:47:37.154
PERHAPS THAT ESTIMATE.

00:47:37.221 --> 00:47:38.388
THE ORIGINAL ONE THAT THEY USED

00:47:38.455 --> 00:47:40.390
MAYBE HAD SOME ISSUES WITH IT

00:47:40.457 --> 00:47:42.426
AND THAT PROJECT HAD HAD SOME

00:47:42.492 --> 00:47:43.894
COST INCREASES AND SO.

00:47:43.961 --> 00:47:45.062
SEEMS LIKE THERE MIGHT NOT BE

00:47:45.128 --> 00:47:46.930
THAT SYSTEMS IN PLACE INTERNALLY

00:47:46.997 --> 00:47:49.666
AND HOW GOING BACK AND FORTH

00:47:49.733 --> 00:47:51.034
BETWEEN CAO FIRING TGS TO MAKE

00:47:51.101 --> 00:47:52.703
SURE THAT THE ESTIMATES THAT

00:47:52.769 --> 00:47:54.137
THEY'RE USING ESPECIALLY IF

00:47:54.204 --> 00:47:55.105
THEY'RE TRYING TO TAKE THE

00:47:55.172 --> 00:47:56.373
PLANTS FROM ANOTHER PROJECT.

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:57.608
HAVE BEEN FULLY UPDATED TO

00:47:57.674 --> 00:47:59.810
ACCOUNT FOR OTHER CHANGES OR TO

00:47:59.876 --> 00:48:01.178
ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT MAYBE

00:48:01.245 --> 00:48:02.813
THAT ORIGINAL ESTIMATE HAD SOME

00:48:02.879 --> 00:48:03.680
ISSUES WITH THE IN THE FIRST

00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:05.115
PLACE AND SO WE THINK IT JUST

00:48:05.182 --> 00:48:06.617
RAISES SOME OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS.

00:48:06.683 --> 00:48:08.318
I'M NOW IN IN THE FUTURE ABOUT

00:48:08.385 --> 00:48:09.820
HOW THESE PROJECTS ARE BEING

00:48:09.886 --> 00:48:11.355
MANAGING HOW THE ESTIMATES ARE

00:48:11.421 --> 00:48:12.656
BEING DEVELOPED.

00:48:12.723 --> 00:48:16.293
ON BETWEEN HOW FIRE AND TGS SO --

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:17.261
DOES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ONE

00:48:17.327 --> 00:48:24.201
OF REFLECT ON ON THAT PARTICULAR

00:48:24.268 --> 00:48:27.004
ISSUE.

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:29.172
GET ME UNDER SHARPER FINANCE --

00:48:29.239 --> 00:48:31.508
I JUST WANNA SAY WE ARE ON THE

00:48:31.575 --> 00:48:32.109
CAPITAL OUTLAY SIDE AND YOUR

00:48:32.175 --> 00:48:32.676
COMMITTEE HAS HEARD SEVERAL

00:48:32.743 --> 00:48:33.310
ISSUES TO WHERE WE ARE FINDING

00:48:33.377 --> 00:48:34.745
COST INCREASES WITH MATERIALS

00:48:34.811 --> 00:48:36.079
AND LABOR -- IT'S IN NATURE OF

00:48:36.146 --> 00:48:36.980
HAVING A GOOD ECONOMY WHICH IS

00:48:37.047 --> 00:48:38.282
GOOD AND IN ONE WAY BUT NOT SO

00:48:38.348 --> 00:48:39.616
GOOD.

00:48:39.683 --> 00:48:39.950
FOR áP COSTS.

00:48:40.017 --> 00:48:41.485
SO -- WE DEFINITELY HAVE BEEN

00:48:41.551 --> 00:48:42.786
LOOKING AT PROJECTS AND IT MAY I

00:48:42.853 --> 00:48:45.188
AM WE'LL BE TALKING INTERNALLY

00:48:45.255 --> 00:48:46.390
ABOUT SOME STRATEGIES WE WANT TO

00:48:46.456 --> 00:48:47.891
DO EVEN GOING INTO NEXT YEAR'S

00:48:47.958 --> 00:48:49.526
BUDGET AS TO WHETHER WE WANT TO

00:48:49.593 --> 00:48:51.728
DO COST UPDATES -- ON A GRAND

00:48:51.795 --> 00:48:52.963
SCALE FOR SOME OF OUR OLDER

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:55.032
PROJECTS WE GET A LOT OF

00:48:55.098 --> 00:48:57.401
EFFICIENCIES WHEN WE USE DESIGNS

00:48:57.467 --> 00:48:58.535
FOR PROJECTS EXPRESSLY WHEN

00:48:58.602 --> 00:48:59.870
THEY'RE ALMOST SIMILAR YOU KNOW

00:48:59.936 --> 00:49:01.872
WE CAN SAVE A LOT OF MONEY BUT

00:49:01.938 --> 00:49:02.739
WEAR THAT.

00:49:02.806 --> 00:49:04.808
AND IT DOES THE THE PITFALL IS

00:49:04.875 --> 00:49:05.976
FOR THINGS THAT WE CAN'T REALLY

00:49:06.043 --> 00:49:07.544
ACCOUNT FOR AND THAT'S THE

00:49:07.611 --> 00:49:10.013
ECONOMY AND MATERIALS SO WE'RE

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.381
THINKING ABOUT -- DOING SOME

00:49:11.448 --> 00:49:13.717
DEEPER ANALYSIS INTO THAT AND

00:49:13.784 --> 00:49:15.285
WHETHER WILL -- UPDATE PROJECTS

00:49:15.352 --> 00:49:16.286
ON A LARGER SCALE IT'S

00:49:16.353 --> 00:49:20.791
DEFINITELY SOMETHING I'LL BE

00:49:20.857 --> 00:49:21.858
LOOKING OUT OF MY AREA.

00:49:21.925 --> 00:49:23.360
BUT I I THINK FOR THIS PROJECT

00:49:23.427 --> 00:49:25.295
THERE'S WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD.

00:49:25.362 --> 00:49:27.130
THE DIRECTOR PORTER YOUR KIND OF

00:49:27.197 --> 00:49:27.698
TAKING A FRESH LOOK AT THIS

00:49:27.764 --> 00:49:30.334
BECAUSE ALL THIS PROCEEDED -- TO

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:33.503
YOUR TO YOUR TIME IS TO AS

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:36.173
DIRECTOR -- DO YOU SEE ANY

00:49:36.239 --> 00:49:37.808
PLACES -- WHERE YOU WOULD DO

00:49:37.874 --> 00:49:39.009
THINGS DIFFERENTLY OR THERE'S

00:49:39.076 --> 00:49:40.977
LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE -- FROM

00:49:41.044 --> 00:49:43.780
THE PROCESS HERE -- YES IN ON

00:49:43.847 --> 00:49:45.649
SCOPE I AM I'M GONNA I'M GONNA

00:49:45.716 --> 00:49:46.883
GIVE YOU A BRIDGE A MINUTE TAKE

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:50.020
A BRIDGE -- AND INTRODUCE --

THANK YOU -- THE ESTIMATE THAT --

00:50:06.236 --> 00:50:07.104
THE LA WOULD MENTION WAS AN AUTO

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:09.539
SHOP THAT WAS JUST COMPLETED IN

00:50:09.606 --> 00:50:12.509
DECEMBER -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN VERY

00:50:12.576 --> 00:50:15.212
SIMILAR IN IN FUNCTION AND

00:50:15.278 --> 00:50:17.381
ACTUAL FOOTPRINTS SO -- THAT

00:50:17.447 --> 00:50:19.049
PROJECT HAD OVER A BIT QUITE A

00:50:19.116 --> 00:50:22.319
BIT -- AS FAR AS OUR EFFORTS IN

00:50:22.386 --> 00:50:25.222
THE FUTURE -- DID YES DID.

00:50:25.288 --> 00:50:26.390
LET US KNOW THAT THEY THOUGHT

00:50:26.456 --> 00:50:28.091
THERE WAS GOING TO BE A BUDGET

00:50:28.158 --> 00:50:29.593
DEFICIT ON THIS FLIGHT. TO THIS

00:50:29.659 --> 00:50:32.329
SCALE WE DID NOT KNOW SO THIS

00:50:32.396 --> 00:50:34.097
WAS -- I'D BIG AYE OPENER IN OUR

00:50:34.164 --> 00:50:36.032
DISCUSSIONS WITH FINANCE IN THE

00:50:36.099 --> 00:50:38.535
LA L. -- HAVE BRIGHT TO REALLY

00:50:38.602 --> 00:50:41.037
TO THE FOREFRONT OF THAT WE NEED

00:50:41.104 --> 00:50:45.375
TO DO THIS WORK GOES TO BED AND

00:50:45.442 --> 00:50:46.810
BE MUCH MORE AWARE WHAT WE'RE

00:50:46.877 --> 00:50:50.013
FACING -- GOING FORWARD I THINK

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:52.082
OF LOOKING AT IT.

00:50:52.149 --> 00:50:53.717
WE TRY TO DO OUR BEST AS FAR AS

00:50:53.784 --> 00:50:55.085
LOOKING THAT ARE THERE ARE OTHER

00:50:55.152 --> 00:50:56.953
ESTIMATED IN WITH THAT PROJECT

00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:59.055
ENDED UP AT AT ITS CLOSE.

00:50:59.122 --> 00:51:01.158
AND ROUGHLY HOW MUCH IT HAD GONE

00:51:01.224 --> 00:51:02.993
OVER FROM THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATE --

00:51:03.059 --> 00:51:04.995
I THINK THE ITEMS THAT WE DIDN'T

00:51:05.061 --> 00:51:07.130
TAKE INTO SERIOUS ACCOUNT WAS

00:51:07.197 --> 00:51:08.298
THE LOCATION.

00:51:08.365 --> 00:51:09.633
OF BEDLAM IN CAMP WHERE THIS

00:51:09.699 --> 00:51:13.737
AUTO SHOPS GOING WHICH IS AN

00:51:13.804 --> 00:51:15.906
NARROW ROAD SO -- TRANSPORTATION

00:51:15.972 --> 00:51:18.442
MATERIALS -- WAS BASICALLY

00:51:18.508 --> 00:51:20.544
DOUBLED -- THAT WAS TAKEN INTO

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:22.245
ACCOUNT IN THE ESTIMATE SO I

00:51:22.312 --> 00:51:25.048
THINK IT'S FROM TALKING I

00:51:25.115 --> 00:51:25.649
PRIMARILY THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:51:25.715 --> 00:51:27.217
FINANCE I WANNA HAVE A SIT DOWN

00:51:27.284 --> 00:51:29.586
WITH TGS BEFORE THESE GO TO BED

00:51:29.653 --> 00:51:32.656
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GOT OUR ALL

00:51:32.722 --> 00:51:36.226
REVENUES COVERED.

00:51:36.293 --> 00:51:36.793
QUITE HONESTLY Là BARRISTAN

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:38.061
THIS.

00:51:38.128 --> 00:51:40.897
ONE OKAY WELL -- AS LONG AS ALL

00:51:40.964 --> 00:51:43.200
THAT -- EMBARRASSMENT OR

00:51:43.266 --> 00:51:45.735
WHATEVER A ONE WANTS TO CALL IT --

00:51:45.802 --> 00:51:46.970
IS CHANNELED INTO A POSITIVE

00:51:47.037 --> 00:51:49.239
PLACE THEN WILL END UP IN A GOOD

00:51:49.306 --> 00:51:49.806
PLACE IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS

00:51:49.873 --> 00:51:52.476
PROJECT WAS DESTINED TO COST.

00:51:52.542 --> 00:51:54.144
MORE THAN IT WAS ORIGINALLY

00:51:54.211 --> 00:51:57.948
PROJECTED -- FOR IT'S NOT A COST

00:51:58.014 --> 00:52:01.351
OVERRUN IN THE SENSE THAT -- YOU

00:52:01.418 --> 00:52:03.553
KNOW TRADITIONALLY WEAK -- WOULD

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:04.554
REALLY HAVE CONCERNS

00:52:04.621 --> 00:52:08.158
STRUCTURALLY -- ABOUT WHAT'S

00:52:08.225 --> 00:52:12.262
GOING ON BUT IT IT IT IT.

00:52:12.329 --> 00:52:13.930
ALSO LIKE THE THE TROUBLING PART

00:52:13.997 --> 00:52:16.066
OF IT IS IT SOUNDS LIKE.

00:52:16.132 --> 00:52:19.035
THERE WERE -- THERE WAS AN

00:52:19.102 --> 00:52:20.237
ASSUMPTION THAT BECAUSE AN AUTO

00:52:20.303 --> 00:52:22.606
SHOP COSTS X. AMOUNT OF DOLLARS

00:52:22.672 --> 00:52:24.374
IN ONE PLACE IT'LL COST ABOUT

00:52:24.441 --> 00:52:26.576
THE SAME THING IN ANOTHER PLACE

00:52:26.643 --> 00:52:27.611
AND TAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A

00:52:27.677 --> 00:52:28.078
VERY.

00:52:28.144 --> 00:52:31.348
EFFECTIVE WAY TO ANALYZE

00:52:31.414 --> 00:52:33.583
PROJECTS.

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:35.785
MR FUNG HAS A QUESTION.

00:52:35.852 --> 00:52:37.254
JUST A QUICK QUESTION -- FOR

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:38.321
FIDELIO.

00:52:38.388 --> 00:52:39.923
IN TERMS OF OVERSIGHT.

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:41.658
AND THE ANALYSIS YOU'VE DONE FOR

00:52:41.725 --> 00:52:42.993
OTHER AGENCIES IS THIS AN

00:52:43.059 --> 00:52:45.428
ANOMALY OR DO YOU DO DO YOU SEE

00:52:45.495 --> 00:52:47.631
A PATTERN OF OF OF CONCERNED

00:52:47.697 --> 00:52:49.232
WITH D. G. S. N..

00:52:49.299 --> 00:52:50.667
AND THE THE PLANNING AND THAT

00:52:50.734 --> 00:52:52.202
AND THE COST ESTIMATES I AM I

00:52:52.269 --> 00:52:54.538
WOULD HAVE TO HAVE AND OUR STAFF

00:52:54.604 --> 00:52:56.706
WHO WORKS ON TGS GET BACK TO YOU

00:52:56.773 --> 00:52:57.841
I'M NOT.

00:52:57.908 --> 00:52:59.609
AWARE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

00:52:59.676 --> 00:53:00.977
THAT WAS DRIVING SOME OF THE

00:53:01.044 --> 00:53:02.579
CONCERN IS THAT YOU IN IN TERMS

00:53:02.646 --> 00:53:03.747
OF THE APRIL REQUEST THAT YOU

00:53:03.813 --> 00:53:04.848
HAVE BEFORE YOU THAT YOU HAD TO

00:53:04.915 --> 00:53:06.550
PROJECTS WITH REALLY SIGNIFICANT

00:53:06.616 --> 00:53:07.317
COST INCREASES.

00:53:07.384 --> 00:53:09.019
WE LOOKED INTO IT WAS FOR

00:53:09.085 --> 00:53:11.054
DIFFERENT REASONS -- YOU KNOW

00:53:11.121 --> 00:53:12.255
ONE THE THE ISSUE PROJECT THAT

00:53:12.322 --> 00:53:14.157
YOU HEARD ALREADY -- IS MORE OF

00:53:14.224 --> 00:53:15.759
A SCOPE CHANGE THIS ONE IS MORE

00:53:15.825 --> 00:53:18.428
OF I THINK JUST ENSURING THAT

00:53:18.495 --> 00:53:19.262
THE DEPARTMENTS HAVE THE

00:53:19.329 --> 00:53:20.630
EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION AND

00:53:20.697 --> 00:53:22.465
PROCESS IN PLACE. TO WEAR THEIR

00:53:22.532 --> 00:53:25.001
ESTIMATES ARE AND YOU KNOW OUR

00:53:25.068 --> 00:53:26.236
MORE REASONABLE IT'S IT'S YOU

00:53:26.303 --> 00:53:27.337
KNOW IN THIS CASE IT WENT SO FAR

00:53:27.404 --> 00:53:28.838
OVER THAT THEY WERE NOT.

00:53:28.905 --> 00:53:30.707
ABLE TO OVER THE PROJECT AND GO

00:53:30.774 --> 00:53:32.943

01:04:21.257 --> 01:04:22.458
HAVE VOTED FOR THIS IF THEY

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:24.026
THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE JUST

01:04:24.093 --> 01:04:26.229
REPLACING -- ONE FUND FOR

01:04:26.295 --> 01:04:28.698
ANOTHER ONE FUNDING SOURCE FOR

01:04:28.764 --> 01:04:29.665
ANOTHER.

01:04:29.732 --> 01:04:30.399
SO THE PURPOSE OF THIS

01:04:30.466 --> 01:04:31.067
INFORMATIONAL I AM TODAY IS FOR

01:04:31.133 --> 01:04:31.901

THESE PROGRAMS -- NAMELY THEIR

01:04:35.805 --> 01:04:37.907
DEMAND CURRENT LEVELS OF FUNDING

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:40.042
AND PROPOSED FUNDING AMOUNTS AND

01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:41.911
SOURCES.

01:04:41.978 --> 01:04:44.247
SHOULD STE ADD THAT WITH --

01:04:44.313 --> 01:04:45.381
INCREASED WILDFIRE RISKS AND

01:04:45.448 --> 01:04:47.049
INCREASINGLY INTENSE WEATHER

01:04:47.116 --> 01:04:48.618
PATTERNS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:04:48.684 --> 01:04:50.386
TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE ADEQUATELY

01:04:50.453 --> 01:04:52.755

01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:30.192
OVERALL -- I CAN SAY THAT THE

01:05:30.259 --> 01:05:31.427

HAVE IS AS MUCH AS FIVE TIMES

01:05:42.538 --> 01:05:43.873
THE ASK THAN.

01:05:43.939 --> 01:05:44.974
THE ACTUAL FUNDING THAT'S

01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:47.777

01:05:47.843 --> 01:05:49.178
R. F. AND PROP.

01:05:49.245 --> 01:05:50.212
SIXTY EIGHT THE PROGRAMS ARE ALL

01:05:50.279 --> 01:05:52.915

WITHIN THIS CALENDAR YEAR.

01:06:00.823 --> 01:06:02.792
SO -- EVEN THOUGH THEY DO HAVE

01:06:02.858 --> 01:06:04.593
PROP SIXTY EIGHT AND G. R. L.

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:06.062

01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:10.433
PROJECTS BY THE END OF THIS YEAR.

01:06:10.499 --> 01:06:12.034
SO THE THE PROGRAMS ARE ROLLING

01:06:12.101 --> 01:06:14.003
AND THE DEMAND IS IS PRETTY HIGH

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:15.338
FOR THEM THE ONLY PROGRAM THAT

01:06:15.404 --> 01:06:17.873
DID NOT HAVE HIGH DEMAND WAS --

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:20.876
IN FISH AND WILDLIFE THEIR

01:06:20.943 --> 01:06:22.178
WEAPONS PROGRAM.

01:06:22.244 --> 01:06:23.245
IN THEIR WORK THEY'RE COMBINING

01:06:23.312 --> 01:06:24.113
THEIR MONEY FROM SEVENTEEN

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:27.116

ACTUALLY BRING IN MORE PEOPLE TO

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:34.190
APPLY FOR THE PROGRAM SO THE ONE

01:06:34.256 --> 01:06:36.192
THAT DID NOT HAVE -- MORE DEMAND

01:06:36.258 --> 01:06:37.760
THAN SUPPLY IS ACTUALLY DOING

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:40.062
SOMETHING TO GO OUT AND GET MORE

01:06:40.129 --> 01:06:40.529
APPLICANTS [inaudible]

01:06:40.596 --> 01:06:45.735
GREAT.

01:06:45.801 --> 01:06:46.969
CIRCLE AGAR DEPARTMENT FINANCE

01:06:47.036 --> 01:06:49.472
SO I DID JUST WANT TO CLARIFY --

01:06:49.538 --> 01:06:51.407
THE GENERAL FUND CHART THAT WAS

01:06:51.474 --> 01:06:53.609
INCLUDED WITHIN THE AGENDA WHICH

01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:55.811
DOES REFERENCE EIGHTY FOUR

01:06:55.878 --> 01:06:56.645
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL

FUND DECREASE AND THE NATURAL

01:06:58.681 --> 01:06:59.582
RESOURCES FUNDING.

01:06:59.648 --> 01:07:01.183
HOWEVER WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:03.219
THAT THAT EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

01:07:03.285 --> 01:07:05.020
AMOUNT REFERENCED IN THE AGENDA

01:07:05.087 --> 01:07:07.189
IS THE REVISED EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

01:07:07.256 --> 01:07:09.225
AMOUNT WHICH INCLUDES THE

01:07:09.291 --> 01:07:11.227
INCREASED CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES

01:07:11.293 --> 01:07:13.696
COST -- IT ALSO INCLUDES A ONE

01:07:13.763 --> 01:07:15.331
TIME LEGISLATIVE INVESTMENTS

01:07:15.398 --> 01:07:16.866
THAT WERE APPROVED AND LAST

01:07:16.932 --> 01:07:19.068
YEAR'S BUDGET AS A ONE TIME BY

01:07:19.135 --> 01:07:20.703
THE LEGISLATURE AND ALSO

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:22.772
INCLUDES SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME

01:07:22.838 --> 01:07:24.140
INVESTMENT THAT WAS MADE FOR THE

01:07:24.206 --> 01:07:25.608
CALIFORNIA INDIAN HERITAGE

01:07:25.674 --> 01:07:26.742
CENTER.

01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:29.044
SO ABSENT THE INCREASED

01:07:29.111 --> 01:07:31.947
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES COST FOR

01:07:32.014 --> 01:07:33.048
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND ABSENT THE

01:07:33.115 --> 01:07:34.517
ONE TIME INVESTMENT THERE IS A

01:07:34.583 --> 01:07:36.352
GENERAL FUND INCREASE IN

01:07:36.419 --> 01:07:37.920
INVESTMENT IN THE NATURAL

01:07:37.987 --> 01:07:38.788
RESOURCES PROGRAM.

01:07:38.854 --> 01:07:43.726
WHICH WE WANT TO CLARIFY -- THAT

01:07:43.793 --> 01:07:45.394
NO ON ON THAT CHART.

01:07:45.461 --> 01:07:46.429
AND ALSO JUST TO PROVIDE A

01:07:46.495 --> 01:07:47.296
LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT ON THE

01:07:47.363 --> 01:07:49.432
OVERALL BUDGET FRAMEWORK -- THE

01:07:49.498 --> 01:07:51.967
BUDGET DOES FOCUS ON RESILIENCY

01:07:52.034 --> 01:07:53.969
AT THE THING ABILITY AND WHILE

01:07:54.036 --> 01:07:55.638
THE STATE DOES CURRENTLY HAVE A

01:07:55.704 --> 01:07:57.273
STRONG FOUNDATION AND A HEALTHY

01:07:57.339 --> 01:07:59.041
BUDGET THERE IS CONTINUE TO

01:07:59.108 --> 01:08:02.044
GROWING RISK AND UNCERTAINTY --

01:08:02.111 --> 01:08:03.379
AND WHILE WE ARE ASSUMING.

01:08:03.446 --> 01:08:05.114
MODERATE GROWTH OVER TO THE

01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:07.883
FORECAST PERIOD I EVEN A MATER

01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:09.251
RECESSION COULD HAVE SOME

01:08:09.318 --> 01:08:11.454
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:12.988
STATE'S THE GENERAL FUND REVENUE

01:08:13.055 --> 01:08:14.056
SO MAINTAINING THE STATE'S

01:08:14.123 --> 01:08:15.991
FISCAL HEALTH AND AND THE STATE

01:08:16.058 --> 01:08:16.659
BUDGET.

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:18.494
IS CRITICAL AND IT'S STILL ON

01:08:18.561 --> 01:08:20.463
ONGOING CHALLENGE GIVEN THE BALL

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:22.097
TH&lt;c.cyan&gt; REVENUE BASE AND THE&lt;/c&gt;

01:08:22.164 --> 01:08:24.266
LIMITED -- SPENDING FLEXIBILITY

01:08:24.333 --> 01:08:26.001
AND YOU MAY RECALL IN THE LAST

01:08:26.068 --> 01:08:28.170
RECESSION THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT

01:08:28.237 --> 01:08:29.605
CUTS TO THE STATE PARKS AND

01:08:29.672 --> 01:08:33.375
OTHER RESOURCES PROGRAMS SO THE

01:08:33.442 --> 01:08:35.311
FOCUS ON BUDGET RESILIENCY AND

01:08:35.377 --> 01:08:36.479
BUDGETS THE THING ABILITY.

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:38.147
MAY HELP US PRESERVE SOME OF

01:08:38.214 --> 01:08:39.281
THESE -- NATURAL RESOURCES

01:08:39.348 --> 01:08:43.719
PROGRAMS IF THE NEXT ECONOMIC

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:45.421
DOWNTURN HAPPENS.

01:08:45.488 --> 01:08:46.989
WELL -- WHAT OTHER AREAS OF THE

01:08:47.056 --> 01:08:50.759
BUDGET ARE -- ARE ARE BEING

01:08:50.826 --> 01:08:53.062
CONSIDEREDTHE WAY THIS YEAR THE

01:08:53.128 --> 01:08:54.530
BUDGET AS I MEAN I TAKE YOUR

01:08:54.597 --> 01:08:55.664
POINT.

01:08:55.731 --> 01:08:58.033
THAT WE WANT -- TO PRESERVERS

01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:01.203
ALIENS IN THE BUDGET AND AND

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:03.472
MAKE SURE THAT WERE -- BEING

01:09:03.539 --> 01:09:05.241
RESPONSIBLE CONSCIENTIOUS ABOUT

01:09:05.307 --> 01:09:08.978
THE POTENTIAL NEXT RECESSION --

01:09:09.044 --> 01:09:11.180
BUT THIS LITTLE PIECE OF THE OF

01:09:11.247 --> 01:09:13.849
THE BUDGET SEEMS TO STAND OUT --

01:09:13.916 --> 01:09:18.087
AND IT IN SO FAR AS THE A LACK

01:09:18.153 --> 01:09:21.156
OF FOR A OF OF FUNDING SO.

01:09:21.223 --> 01:09:22.558
IF THIS IS.

01:09:22.625 --> 01:09:25.394
A IS IS THE ONLY AREA THAT --

01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:27.596
THIS BEING TREATED THAT WAY OR

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:28.197
IS THERE SOME RHYME OR REASON

01:09:28.264 --> 01:09:30.766
AND OTHER AREAS -- THAT THE SAME

01:09:30.833 --> 01:09:33.102
LOGIC IS BEING APPLIED.

01:09:33.168 --> 01:09:34.470
SO IF THEY IF IF IF BUDGET

01:09:34.537 --> 01:09:37.973
FRAMEWORK APPLIES TO ALL AREAS --

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:39.742
AND LOOKING AT NATURAL RESOURCES

01:09:39.808 --> 01:09:41.176
OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS THERE

01:09:41.243 --> 01:09:43.312
HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT ONGOING

01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:45.581
GENERAL FUND INCREASES FOR AND

01:09:45.648 --> 01:09:49.084
ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION AND NINE

01:09:49.151 --> 01:09:49.952
TEN TO NOW THREE POINT FIVE

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:50.519
BILLION.

01:09:50.586 --> 01:09:53.088
AND THAT IN ADDITION TO THE BOND

01:09:53.155 --> 01:09:54.657
FUNDS WHICH ARE ULTIMATELY THAT

01:09:54.723 --> 01:09:56.492
SERVICE PAID BY THE GENERAL FUND

01:09:56.559 --> 01:09:57.493
IN ADDITION TO THE SPECIAL FUNDS

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:58.394
SO.

01:09:58.460 --> 01:09:59.695
IF WE LOOK AT HISTORICAL GROWTH

01:09:59.762 --> 01:10:01.864
IN THIS AREA THEY HAVE BEEN

01:10:01.931 --> 01:10:03.966
CLIMBING OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:05.668
AGO THAT SO HAVE -- VIRTUALLY

01:10:05.734 --> 01:10:07.336
EVERY OTHER AREA OF THE BUDGET

01:10:07.403 --> 01:10:11.407
SO WHAT DISTINGUISHES THIS FROM

01:10:11.473 --> 01:10:14.310
ALL THOSE OTHER AREAS.

01:10:14.376 --> 01:10:15.511
I WILL BE.

01:10:15.578 --> 01:10:16.478
SURE TO READ THE COVER WITH

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:18.247
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- I THINK.

01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:20.316
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE CHART

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:21.183
IN THE AGENDA AND TRYING TO LOOK

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:22.484
AT LIKE THE YEAR OVER YEAR

01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:23.786
CHANGES I THINK THERE ARE A

01:10:23.852 --> 01:10:24.820
COUPLE OF UNUSUAL THINGS THAT

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:26.121
MISTER AGUILAR IS REFERRING TO

01:10:26.188 --> 01:10:27.489
LIKE?

01:10:27.556 --> 01:10:29.224
THE THAT EMERGENCY RESPONSE

01:10:29.291 --> 01:10:30.826
MONEY THAT WAS IN HERE THE ONE

01:10:30.893 --> 01:10:32.494
TIME INVESTMENTS ARE NOT UNIQUE

01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:33.862
TO THIS AREA I THINK THERE'S

01:10:33.929 --> 01:10:35.831
BEEN A NUMBER OF AREAS OF HAD

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:37.700
ONE TIME I'M THE LEGISLATIVE

01:10:37.766 --> 01:10:39.168
INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN PART OF

01:10:39.234 --> 01:10:39.935
PRIOR BUDGETS.

01:10:40.002 --> 01:10:42.972
AND SO I THINK -- TRAINING

01:10:43.038 --> 01:10:43.772
OVERTIME IS.

01:10:43.839 --> 01:10:44.907
SERGIO MENTIONED IT HAS BEEN

01:10:44.974 --> 01:10:46.609
GROWING AND WE WANTED TO POINT

01:10:46.675 --> 01:10:50.913
OUT THAT KIND OF LOOKING AT THIS

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.615
YEAR OVER YEAR.

01:10:52.681 --> 01:10:53.582
I AM AT WITH THE REVISED NUMBERS

01:10:53.649 --> 01:10:54.216
DOESN'T QUITE QUITE REFLECT ALL

01:10:54.283 --> 01:10:55.284
THE OTHER THINGS GOING ON IN

01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:57.286
THIS AREA.

01:10:57.353 --> 01:10:58.887
WITH THE THE BOND FUNDS WITH THE

01:10:58.954 --> 01:10:59.788
ONE TIME INVESTMENT WITH THE

01:10:59.855 --> 01:11:01.624
EMERGENCY FUNDING THAT WAS IN

01:11:30.753 --> 01:11:31.687
CONSIDERATIONS THAT WENT INTO

01:11:31.754 --> 01:11:33.455
THE JANUARY TURN TEN VERSION OF

01:11:33.522 --> 01:11:34.590
THE CAP AND MAKE SENATOR KEVIN

TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN -- IN

01:11:36.825 --> 01:11:37.393
TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE HAD

01:11:37.459 --> 01:11:38.894
MORE REVENUES IN THE PLAN AND SO

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:40.896
WE HAVE DROPPED FROM THE

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:41.463
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN LEVELS TO

01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:43.766
ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE

01:11:43.832 --> 01:11:44.333
TWENTY NINETEEN EXPENDITURE

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.035
PLANET JANUARY.

01:11:46.101 --> 01:11:49.738
TEN CONSIDERATIONS THAT WERE --

01:11:49.805 --> 01:11:50.939
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT INCLUDE YOU

01:11:51.006 --> 01:11:52.007
KNOW THE DECLINING REVENUE

01:11:52.074 --> 01:11:54.276
LEVELS -- THE GOALS OF MEETING

01:11:54.343 --> 01:11:56.645
THE REQUIRED 35% TARGETS FOR

01:11:56.712 --> 01:11:57.813
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES LOW

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.481
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS LOOKING AT THE

01:11:59.548 --> 01:12:00.916
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:02.451
RECEIVE FUNDING ON AN ONGOING

01:12:02.518 --> 01:12:03.185
BASIS.

01:12:03.252 --> 01:12:04.853
AND ALSO -- LOOKING AND

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.722
RESPONDING TO THE FEEDBACK THAT

01:12:06.789 --> 01:12:08.824
WAS PROVIDED AS PART.

01:12:08.891 --> 01:12:09.692
OF THE THIRD INVESTMENT PLAN

01:12:09.758 --> 01:12:12.161
FROM STAKEHOLDERS THE FOCUS ON

01:12:12.227 --> 01:12:14.363
THE LOOKING AT LOCAL NEEDS --

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:16.565
YOU KNOW.

01:12:16.632 --> 01:12:17.700
PART OF THE FUNDING GOING TO

01:12:17.766 --> 01:12:18.967
THAT TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE

01:12:19.034 --> 01:12:20.202
COMMUNITIES AND OTHER

01:12:20.269 --> 01:12:21.437
CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS THOSE SO

01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:22.271
WE JUST WANTED TO GIVE A LITTLE

01:12:22.337 --> 01:12:23.806
BIT OF CONTEXT OF WHAT WENT INTO

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:25.607
THE JANUARY.

01:12:25.674 --> 01:12:27.609
TEN PLANNING AS WELL AS THE

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:29.645
DECLINING CAP AND TRADE REVENUES.

01:12:29.712 --> 01:12:31.080
THE QUESTION ALSO POSED IN THE

01:12:31.146 --> 01:12:33.382
AGENDA IS ASKING WHETHER WE ARE

01:12:33.449 --> 01:12:34.983
CONSIDERING RESTORATION AS PART

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:36.351
OF THE MAYOR VISION AND I'M

01:12:36.418 --> 01:12:37.086
OBVIOUSLY NOT AT LIBERTY TO

01:12:37.152 --> 01:12:38.454
DISCUSS WHAT'S IN THE MAY

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.189
REVISION BUT WE WILL HAVE -- AN

01:12:40.255 --> 01:12:41.957
UPDATED PLAN BECAUSE OF UPDATED

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:44.026
REVENUES AS IS.

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:46.128
TYPICALLY WHAT WE PROVIDE IT MAY

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:50.733
REVISION.

01:12:50.799 --> 01:12:52.101
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK THE VOTERS

01:12:52.167 --> 01:12:54.002
WERE LOOKING FOR WHEN THEY

01:12:54.069 --> 01:12:55.771
PASSED PROP.

01:12:55.838 --> 01:12:58.807
SIXTY EIGHT SO ON I AND M..

01:12:58.874 --> 01:13:00.375
I HAVE A AS USUAL I MEAN THE

01:13:00.442 --> 01:13:01.076
ADMINISTRATION.

01:13:01.143 --> 01:13:01.744
RIGHT AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS

01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:04.179
BEEN -- A TOPIC THAT'S BEEN AND

01:13:04.246 --> 01:13:04.747
COVER BEFORE AND DISCUSSED

01:13:04.813 --> 01:13:07.549
BEFORE US AS FAR AS WHERE TO

01:13:07.616 --> 01:13:08.784
INVEST AS PROP SIXTY EIGHT

01:13:08.851 --> 01:13:13.589
DOLLARS -- WANTED A NOTE THAT.

01:13:13.655 --> 01:13:15.157
THE EXISTENCE OF THE PROP SIXTY

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:17.092
EIGHT DOLLARS ALONE DOESN'T.

01:13:17.159 --> 01:13:18.160
PRECLUDE ADDITIONAL JDRF

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:19.027
SPENDING I THINK HEALTHY SOILS

01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:21.230
IS ONE AREA WHERE THEY HAD PROP

01:13:21.296 --> 01:13:22.331
SIXTY EIGHT FUNDING I BELIEVE IN

01:13:22.397 --> 01:13:22.831
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND IS

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:24.566
ACTUALLY EXPANDED UPON IN THE

01:13:24.633 --> 01:13:25.400
NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET.

01:13:25.467 --> 01:13:26.335
SO IT'S NOT LIKE THIS OVER

01:13:26.401 --> 01:13:28.003
ARCHING RULE THAT IS APPLIED AS

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:30.506
FAR AS WHAT'S THERE FOR PROP

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:31.507
SIXTY EIGHT FUNDING.

01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:32.541
I AGREE WITH WHAT MR CASH

01:13:32.608 --> 01:13:34.276
PRESENTED AS FAR AS THEIR SCENES

01:13:34.343 --> 01:13:36.245
YOU KNOW TO BE QUITE A DEMAND

01:13:36.311 --> 01:13:37.513
FOR THE PROP SIXTY PROGRAMS AS

01:13:37.579 --> 01:13:39.448
WELL AS A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS

01:13:39.515 --> 01:13:41.116
AS WELL AS JUST THE GENERAL FUND.

01:13:41.183 --> 01:13:42.651
OVERALL AND SO I THINK TAKING

01:13:42.718 --> 01:13:44.019
INTO CONSIDERATION KIND OF ALL

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:45.220
THE FUNDING SOURCES THAT COME

01:13:45.287 --> 01:13:49.424
INTO PLAY IN THIS AREA IT IS --

01:13:49.491 --> 01:13:50.225
ONE THAT INVOLVES ALL OF YOU

01:13:50.292 --> 01:13:51.660
KNOW LOOKING AT ALL THE NEEDS

01:13:51.727 --> 01:13:52.895
AND THEN PRIORITIZING BASED ON

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:54.696
WHAT REVENUES ARE AVAILABLE AND

01:13:54.763 --> 01:13:57.699
FOR WHAT PURPOSES CHAU -- I

01:13:57.766 --> 01:14:00.836
WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THE

01:14:00.903 --> 01:14:03.205
THE ADMINISTRATION'S VIEW ON

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:05.007
THIS DOES THE ADMINISTRATION

01:14:05.073 --> 01:14:08.210
VIEW -- PROXY PROP SIXTY EIGHT

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:10.445
AS A FUNDING SOURCE THAT SUB

01:14:10.512 --> 01:14:12.948
THAT WOULD BE SUPPLEMENTAL -- TO

01:14:13.015 --> 01:14:16.685
THESE PROGRAMS OR THAT WOULD

01:14:16.752 --> 01:14:21.323
SUPPLANT THE I THINK OUR VIEW IS

01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:24.092
WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT.

01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:24.726

01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:38.807
RIGHT I'M.

01:14:38.874 --> 01:14:43.011
NOT SATISFIED WITH THAT RESPONSE --

01:14:43.078 --> 01:14:45.514
ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:47.549

TEARS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE

01:24:40.375 --> 01:24:43.278
AS WELL.

01:24:43.344 --> 01:24:43.845
FREE WITH THE POOREST REST

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:44.479
AGREED WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S

01:24:44.546 --> 01:24:45.880
BEEN SAID SO FAR AND I WANT TO

01:24:45.947 --> 01:24:47.415
STEP BACK AND JUST LOOK AT THE

01:24:47.482 --> 01:24:48.383
BIG PICTURE A LITTLE BIT MORE.

01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:50.518
THESE PROGRAMS ARE ALL VERY COST

01:24:50.585 --> 01:24:52.353
EFFECTIVE WAYS FOR US TO REDUCE

01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:53.855
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:54.989
BUT THE PLACE WHERE I THINK THEY

01:24:55.056 --> 01:24:57.459
REALLY ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL

01:24:57.525 --> 01:24:59.093
IS HELPING TO ADAPT OUR NATURAL

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.528
LANDSCAPE TO THE WORLD WE'RE

01:25:00.595 --> 01:25:01.729
GOING TO BE LIVING AND AND UNDER

01:25:01.796 --> 01:25:02.864
CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:04.365
THAT'S WHERE I AM MOST FREAKED

01:25:04.432 --> 01:25:06.334
OUT BY THE LACK OF PROGRESS THE

01:25:06.401 --> 01:25:07.702
CALIFORNIA HAS MADE BECAUSE

01:25:07.769 --> 01:25:09.270
WE'RE GOING TO SEE MORE EXTREME

01:25:09.337 --> 01:25:11.239
WEATHER EVENTS A BIGGER STORMS

01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:12.407
BIGGER FLOODS.

01:25:12.474 --> 01:25:13.508
THE SORTS OF INVESTMENTS WE SEE

01:25:13.575 --> 01:25:15.577
AND RESTORING MOUNTAIN MEADOWS

01:25:15.643 --> 01:25:17.178
AND FORESTS AND WATERSHED.

01:25:17.245 --> 01:25:18.980
CAN BE CRITICAL FOR BUFFERING

01:25:19.047 --> 01:25:20.915
THAT STORM FLOW AND HELPING TO

01:25:20.982 --> 01:25:21.716
MAKE SURE WE DON'T SEE ANOTHER

01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:22.350
SITUATION.

01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:23.718
LIKE WITH IN ORVILLE COUPLE OF

01:25:23.785 --> 01:25:25.887
YEARS AGO YOU KNOW THE HOT DRY

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:27.055
SUMMERS THEY'RE GONNA BE DEALING

01:25:27.121 --> 01:25:28.790
WITH THE URBAN FORESTRY URBAN

01:25:28.857 --> 01:25:29.724
GREENING INVESTMENT OR MAKING A

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:30.859
MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE

01:25:30.925 --> 01:25:32.227
HABITABILITY OF CALIFORNIA THE

01:25:32.293 --> 01:25:33.061
FUTURE.

01:25:33.127 --> 01:25:34.929
BUT THESE THINGS TAKE TIME TO

01:25:34.996 --> 01:25:36.531
COME TO FRUITION THE STREET OR

01:25:36.598 --> 01:25:38.733
PLANTING THIS YEAR AND NEXT YEAR

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.068
ARE GONNA BE GREAT SHADE TREES

01:25:40.134 --> 01:25:41.169
RATHER DECADE OR TWO SO WE CAN'T

01:25:41.236 --> 01:25:41.903
BE PUTTING THE THINGS OFF WE

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:42.937
NEED TO BE MAKING.

01:25:43.004 --> 01:25:44.239
THESE SUBSTANTIVE INVESTMENTS

01:25:44.305 --> 01:25:46.140
NOW SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU

01:25:46.207 --> 01:25:47.876

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:07.462
WE WORK WITH FARMERS -- AROUND

01:26:07.529 --> 01:26:09.764
THE STATE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN

01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:10.865
THE CLAIM IT'S MORE LIKE A

01:26:10.932 --> 01:26:12.300
CULTURE PROGRAMS QUITE FRANKLY

01:26:12.367 --> 01:26:13.201
NOT ALWAYS BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:26:13.268 --> 01:26:14.702
INTERESTED IN REDUCING METHANE

01:26:14.769 --> 01:26:16.304
EMISSIONS ARE NECESSARILY

01:26:16.371 --> 01:26:17.605
SEQUESTERING CARBON.

01:26:17.672 --> 01:26:19.774
BUT THOSE SAME PROJECTS THAT ARE

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:21.309
DELIVERING THOSE GREENHOUSE GAS

01:26:21.376 --> 01:26:23.211
EMISSION REDUCTION BENEFITS ARE

01:26:23.278 --> 01:26:25.179
DELIVERING BENEFITS TO THE FARM --%

01:26:25.246 --> 01:26:26.981

01:26:35.523 --> 01:26:37.058
IS THAT FUNDING NUMBERS GO UP

01:26:37.125 --> 01:26:38.493

THE FUNDING SOURCES KEEP

01:26:55.944 --> 01:26:57.278

CLIMATE SMART UYGHUR CULTURE IS

01:27:07.088 --> 01:27:08.656
A KEY COMPONENT TO THAT.

01:27:08.723 --> 01:27:10.224

HAVE ONE POINT EIGHT PARKS PER

01:27:50.598 --> 01:27:51.733
TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE.

DON'T HAVE.

01:27:56.371 --> 01:27:58.473
ACCESS TO GREEN SPACES NEAR

01:27:58.539 --> 01:28:00.408
THEIR HOMES -- YOU KNOW I THINK

01:28:00.475 --> 01:28:01.576
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY

01:28:01.643 --> 01:28:02.810
IMPORTANT WE SHOOTING BE

01:28:02.877 --> 01:28:06.347
INCREASING GREEN SPACES AND NOT.

01:28:06.414 --> 01:28:08.082
ON DECREASING THEM ESPECIALLY

01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:10.251
OUR INVESTMENTS IN THOSE AREAS

01:28:10.318 --> 01:28:11.586
IN HERE THAT'S ONE THE REASONS

01:28:11.653 --> 01:28:13.955

KNOW UNLESS -- YOU KNOW WE

01:28:26.434 --> 01:28:30.104
CREATE MORE THAN -- THEY

COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW SO -- I

01:28:36.344 --> 01:28:36.911
THINK WE SHOULD BE USING BOTH

01:28:36.978 --> 01:28:38.212
OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH THE G. G.

01:28:38.279 --> 01:28:43.418

FUNDS -- FOR FOR OTHER PURPOSES --

01:29:21.923 --> 01:29:23.057
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW I THINK

01:29:23.124 --> 01:29:26.828
IT'S JUST BACKED UP BY LOGIC AS

01:29:26.894 --> 01:29:28.730
MUCH AS ANYTHING ELSE THESE --

01:29:28.796 --> 01:29:31.632

MEASURE AND -- TO INCREASE

01:29:56.190 --> 01:29:58.059
REVENUE SOURCES SAY A THING VERY

01:29:58.126 --> 01:30:01.329
CAREFULLY AS WE ALL KNOW ABOUT --

01:30:01.395 --> 01:30:02.964
ABOUT THESE ISSUES SO WE HAVE A

01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:07.702
RESPONSIBILITY -- TO TO ALLOCATE

01:30:07.769 --> 01:30:10.271
THE FUNDS IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY

01:30:10.338 --> 01:30:12.006
THAT REFLECTS THE THE OF USE OF

01:30:12.073 --> 01:30:14.008
THE OF THE VOTERS AND I DON'T

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:15.676
