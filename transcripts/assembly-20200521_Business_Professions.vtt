OVERALL THE FALL BY ASSEMBLY

01:01:59.348 --> 01:02:05.221
ONE EGGMAN. OUR OUR STAFF. BUT

01:02:05.288 --> 01:02:07.890
FIRST YEAH THERE WE GO-

01:02:07.957 --> 01:02:09.592

01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:15.832
HAS IT OPPOSE RECOMMENDATION ON

01:02:15.898 --> 01:02:17.400
THIS BILL- I ACTUALLY DISAGREE

01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:19.235
I THINK THIS IS A GOOD BILL I

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:20.169
THINK THIS IS NEEDED CONSUMER

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:22.472
PROTECTION. THAT YOU'RE ACTING

01:02:22.538 --> 01:02:23.172
AND I COMPLIMENT YOU FOR

01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:24.807
BRINGING FORWARD I HAD A

01:02:24.874 --> 01:02:27.176
QUESTION THOUGH ABOUT THE

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:29.011
EXCLUSION OF STATE AND LOCAL

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:30.513
TAXES FROM THE BILL BECAUSE IF

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.149
THE GOAL OF THE BILL. IS SO A

01:02:33.216 --> 01:02:36.018
CONSUMER CAN WHEN I GET A PRICE

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:38.488
FOR A HOTEL ROOM IN REAL AT

01:02:38.554 --> 01:02:39.555
THAT SURPRISE THEY'RE ACTUALLY

01:02:39.622 --> 01:02:40.423
GOING TO PAY WHEN THEY SHOW UP

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:42.125
WHY WOULD WE NOT INCLUDE STATE

01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:43.392
AND LOCAL TAXES AND THAT I'M

01:02:43.459 --> 01:02:44.327
THINKING ABOUT A SITUATION

01:02:44.393 --> 01:02:46.696
WHERE. A CONSUMER IS BOOKED IS

01:02:46.762 --> 01:02:48.397
COMPARISON SHOPPING BETWEEN TWO

01:02:48.464 --> 01:02:49.932
HOTELS THAT ARE CLOSE TOGETHER

01:02:49.999 --> 01:02:51.501
BUT UNBEKNOWNST TO THE CONSUMER

01:02:51.567 --> 01:02:53.569
WAS ONE IS RIGHT ACROSS THE

01:02:53.636 --> 01:02:54.670
CITY LINE IS TECHNICALLY A

01:02:54.737 --> 01:02:55.771
DIFFERENT CITY WITH A VERY

01:02:55.838 --> 01:02:58.241
DIFFERENT- OCCUPANCY TAX RATE

01:02:58.307 --> 01:03:00.109
SO ONE ACTIVITIES TAX MIGHT BE

01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:01.110
TWICE AS MUCH AS THE OTHER I

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:02.111
THINK THAT THAT'S INFORMATION

01:03:02.178 --> 01:03:03.446
THE CONSUMER SHOULD GET. I

01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:04.580
THINK THE PRICE THAT THE

01:03:04.647 --> 01:03:06.349
CONSUMER SIEGE SHOULD BE THE

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:08.851
PRICE THAT THEY PAY WHEN- THEY

01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:11.120
BUT WHEN THEY STAY AT THE HOTEL

01:03:11.187 --> 01:03:12.522
I WONDER WHY IT WITH THE LOGIC

01:03:12.588 --> 01:03:17.927
WAS. NOW IN EXCLUDING THOSE. AS

01:03:17.994 --> 01:03:19.762
A KIND OF A OVER. OF MY PART. I

01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:22.031
SAW THAT YOU HE- THE SO TAX. IS

01:03:22.098 --> 01:03:24.634
NON TO. ALMOST A OR OTHER CUT A

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:27.203
CONSUMERS. SO I'VE ALL BE HAPPY

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:29.939
TO WORK WITH YOU TO INCLUDE.

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:32.942

01:03:57.833 --> 01:04:00.503
HAD A BILL LIKE THIS I HAD A

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:02.138
AND I ATE WAS A CONSTITUENT WHO

01:04:02.205 --> 01:04:02.772
REACHED OUT TO ME HE SAID THIS

01:04:02.838 --> 01:04:04.874
IS. I WON'T I WON'T USE THE

01:04:04.941 --> 01:04:06.475
WORD THE CONSTITUENT USE BUT

01:04:06.542 --> 01:04:07.543
THAT THESE THESE HIDDEN FEES

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:09.845
ARE THERE- AND I AGREED AND WE

01:04:09.912 --> 01:04:11.147
WENT DOWN THIS PATH AND WE

01:04:11.214 --> 01:04:12.882
WORKED ON IT BUT AGAIN WHEN

01:04:12.949 --> 01:04:14.684
KOBE CRISIS CAME AROUND WE I

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:15.818
DIDN'T THINK THAT THERE WAS A

01:04:15.885 --> 01:04:17.820
COMPELLING REASON. TO DO THIS

01:04:17.887 --> 01:04:19.322
AT THIS TIME I ALSO UNDERSTAND

01:04:19.388 --> 01:04:20.756
WHY YOU HAVE THE RETROACTIVITY

AS THINGS GO FORWARD RIGHT NOW

01:04:27.063 --> 01:04:29.665
SO. I THINK THE RESORT FEE

01:04:29.732 --> 01:04:31.400
POLICY IS A BAD POLICY I LOOK

01:04:31.467 --> 01:04:33.169
FORWARD TO VOTING FOR A BILL IN

01:04:33.236 --> 01:04:35.471

THIS TIME HAS BEEN HARD HIT

01:08:04.213 --> 01:08:06.649
ENOUGH AND THAT THIS IS NOT THE

01:08:06.715 --> 01:08:11.454
TIME TO IMPOSE EVEN MORE A

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.255
REGULATIONS ON THE TRAVEL

01:08:13.322 --> 01:08:16.258

WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY DONE

03:13:23.391 --> 03:13:25.026
OVERWHELMING THE DOCTOR'S

EXAMPLES OF THESE MISTAKES. BUT

03:13:47.482 --> 03:13:48.984
THESE ARE MORE THAN MISTAKES

03:13:49.050 --> 03:13:51.720
THE RESULT. THEY ARE RESULT OF

03:13:51.786 --> 03:13:53.722
DECISIONS BY THESE COMPANIES TO

03:13:53.788 --> 03:13:55.156

DOCTOR'S URGING THEM NOT TO. IT

03:14:10.805 --> 03:14:12.407
ALSO SHOWED DOCTORS OFFICES

03:14:12.474 --> 03:14:13.908
BEING OVERWHELMED WITH THE

03:14:13.975 --> 03:14:15.610
REQUEST THAT ORIGINATED WITH

03:14:15.677 --> 03:14:16.644
THE PHARMACY AND NOT THE

03:14:16.711 --> 03:14:22.017
PATIENT. SO THIS IS AN ISSUE

03:14:22.083 --> 03:14:23.551
THAT IS IMPACTING PERCOLATING

03:14:23.618 --> 03:14:26.421

ADVOCATING FOR FIX TO THIS

03:14:30.592 --> 03:14:34.062
ISSUE FOR A LONG TIME. AB

03:14:34.129 --> 03:14:34.662
TWENTY NINE EIGHTY THREE WOULD

03:14:34.729 --> 03:14:35.964
RESTORE BALANCE BY PROHIBITING

03:14:36.031 --> 03:14:37.432
A PHARMACY FROM AUTOMATICALLY

03:14:37.499 --> 03:14:39.634
REQUESTED A REFILL. FOR PATIENT

03:14:39.701 --> 03:14:41.036
UNLESS THEY HAVE PERMISSION

03:14:41.102 --> 03:14:44.639
FROM THE PATIENT. OR THE DOCTOR.

03:14:44.706 --> 03:14:45.640
THIS WILL LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF

03:14:45.707 --> 03:14:46.741
REFILLS REQUESTED AT THE

03:14:46.808 --> 03:14:48.576
DISCRETION OF THE PHARMACY

03:14:48.643 --> 03:14:49.811
WITHOUT PATIENT FOR DOCTOR

03:14:49.878 --> 03:14:52.781
INPUT. IT ALSO PROHIBITS THEM

03:14:52.847 --> 03:14:55.116
FROM REQUESTED REFILLS BEYOND

03:14:55.183 --> 03:14:55.650
WHAT THE DOCTOR ORIGINALLY

03:14:55.717 --> 03:14:57.485
PRESCRIBED. SO THEY CAN%

03:14:57.552 --> 03:14:59.387
CONTINUE TO PRACTICE THE

PATIENTS AS THEY SHOULD. BUT

03:15:04.426 --> 03:15:05.360
THE NUMBER OF REFILLS THE

03:15:05.427 --> 03:15:08.463
PATIENT RECEIVES SHOULD NOT BE

03:15:08.530 --> 03:15:11.199
RECOMMENDED BY PHARMACY. DO I

03:15:11.266 --> 03:15:14.035
BELIEVE THE NEED IS URGENT I

03:15:14.102 --> 03:15:16.504

PROTECTIONS ARE IN PLACE TO

03:32:34.408 --> 03:32:36.643
PROTECT PEOPLE AND WE SHOULD

03:32:36.710 --> 03:32:39.580
NOT TO LOOK AT JUST SHAREHOLDER

EVERYDAY PEOPLE. AND THAT'S

03:32:42.616 --> 03:32:43.784
WHAT THIS FUNCTION

03:32:43.851 --> 03:32:45.018
FUNDAMENTALLY IS ABOUT THIS

03:32:45.085 --> 03:32:47.588
BILL BEFORE US REQUIRES THEN

03:32:47.654 --> 03:32:48.322

03:33:10.177 --> 03:33:13.480
WHAT I DO. I ASKED HIM FOR THE

03:33:13.547 --> 03:33:16.350

03:33:36.136 --> 03:33:37.938
WE CANNOT BYPASS THE
