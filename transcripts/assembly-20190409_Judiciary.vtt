00:25:52.284 --> 00:25:53.451
ARE ANTI COMPETITIVE.

00:25:53.518 --> 00:25:54.486
THIS PRACTICE IS COSTING

00:25:54.552 --> 00:25:56.154
CONSUMERS AND PAYER SUCH AS

MILLIONS MORE?

00:26:17.442 --> 00:26:18.510

I WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR

00:26:34.726 --> 00:26:36.161

MISTER CHAIRMAN STEAMED MEMBERS

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:32.083
OF THE COMMITTEE.

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:33.151
I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY TO

00:27:33.218 --> 00:27:34.419
ADDRESS AN ISSUE THAT IS CAUSING

00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:36.554
REAL PAIN FOR PATIENTS AND FOR

00:27:36.621 --> 00:27:37.288
THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO HELP

00:27:37.355 --> 00:27:38.223
THEM.

00:27:38.289 --> 00:27:40.458
THAT ISSUE IS PAY FOR DELAY AND

00:27:40.525 --> 00:27:42.560
ITS EFFECTS ON CALIFORNIA'S

00:27:42.627 --> 00:27:43.561
CITIZENS.

HANDS AND AGREE TO KEEP THE

00:27:47.432 --> 00:27:50.101
CHEAPER DRUGS OFF THE MARKET.

00:27:50.168 --> 00:27:51.836
THAT'S BAD FOR CONSUMERS AND

00:27:51.903 --> 00:27:53.738
THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL BEFORE THE

00:27:53.805 --> 00:27:55.774
COMMITTEE IS TRYING TO ADDRESS.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.742
SO WITH PAY FOR DELAY A DRUG

00:27:57.809 --> 00:27:59.244
COMPANY PAYS A CHEAPER

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:01.212
COMPETITOR TO STAY OFF THE

00:28:01.279 --> 00:28:03.715
MARKET FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.

00:28:03.782 --> 00:28:05.417
IT IS AN END RUN AROUND A SYSTEM

00:28:05.483 --> 00:28:08.253
THAT'S DESIGNED TO BRING GENERIC

00:28:08.319 --> 00:28:10.188
DRUGS TO THE MARKET MORE QUICKLY.

00:28:10.255 --> 00:28:11.856
NOW THE TEMPTATION FOR COMPANIES

00:28:11.923 --> 00:28:12.891
TO ENTER IN TO PAY FOR DELAY

00:28:12.957 --> 00:28:14.426
SETTLEMENTS CAN BE EXTREMELY

00:28:14.492 --> 00:28:16.561
POWERFUL BECAUSE THERE IS SO

00:28:16.628 --> 00:28:17.996
MUCH MONEY INVOLVED.

00:28:18.063 --> 00:28:20.231
SO FOR A BLOCK BUSTER BRAND NAME

00:28:20.298 --> 00:28:22.500
DRUGS THE DELAY OF EVEN SIX

00:28:22.567 --> 00:28:24.369
MONTHS CAN BE WORTH A HALF A

00:28:24.436 --> 00:28:25.670
BILLION DOLLARS.

00:28:25.737 --> 00:28:27.605
CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS ARE PAYING

00:28:27.672 --> 00:28:28.773
FOR THAT.

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.341
AND PAY FOR DELAY IS A GROWING

00:28:30.408 --> 00:28:31.443
PROBLEM.

00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:33.545
LOOKING AT THE MOST RECENT SIX

00:28:33.611 --> 00:28:35.246
YEARS OF GOVERNMENT DATA THEY

00:28:35.313 --> 00:28:36.714
WERE ALMOST NINE HUNDRED

00:28:36.781 --> 00:28:38.450
SETTLEMENTS BETWEEN BRAND AND

00:28:38.516 --> 00:28:39.984
GENERIC COMPANIES.

00:28:40.051 --> 00:28:41.486
THERE WERE A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:43.755
IN THE MOST RECENT YEAR ALONE.

00:28:43.822 --> 00:28:46.591
NOW 90% OF THOSE RECENT

00:28:46.658 --> 00:28:48.860
AGREEMENTS IN SOME WAY

00:28:48.927 --> 00:28:51.129
RESTRICTED A CHEAPER DRUGS FROM

00:28:51.196 --> 00:28:52.397
ENTERING THE MARKET.

00:28:52.464 --> 00:28:53.598
IF COMPANIES AGREED TO KEEP

00:28:53.665 --> 00:28:55.200
CHEAPER MEDICINES OFF THE

00:28:55.266 --> 00:28:56.935
SHELVES WE ARE GOING TO SEE

00:28:57.001 --> 00:28:59.270
PRICES COME DOWN IN THE

00:28:59.337 --> 00:29:00.572
CALIFORNIA MARKET PLACE.

00:29:00.638 --> 00:29:02.474
THE FINANCIAL EFFECT OF THE

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:03.541
PAPER DELAYED REMAINS A

00:29:03.608 --> 00:29:05.243
SUBSTANTIAL RECENT GOVERNMENT

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:06.611
REPORTS GIVE A FIGURE FOR A

00:29:06.678 --> 00:29:09.447
SMALL SUBSET OF THESE AGREEMENTS

00:29:09.514 --> 00:29:11.616
AND THAT SMALL SUBSET ALONE

00:29:11.683 --> 00:29:13.618
PROTECTED FIFTEEN BILLION

00:29:13.685 --> 00:29:16.121
DOLLARS IN ANNUAL BRAND NAME

00:29:16.187 --> 00:29:17.422
DRUG SALES.

00:29:17.489 --> 00:29:19.657
GIVEN CALIFORNIA'S SHARE OF

00:29:19.724 --> 00:29:20.692
NATIONAL HEALTHCARE SPENDING

00:29:20.758 --> 00:29:22.660
CALIFORNIANS ARE ON THE HOOK FOR

00:29:22.727 --> 00:29:23.995
A LOT OF THAT MONEY.

00:29:24.062 --> 00:29:26.364
AND IT IS WORTH ASKING TODAY WHO

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:28.266
IS PAYING THE BILL FOR THIS TYPE

00:29:28.333 --> 00:29:29.267
OF BEHAVIOR.

00:29:29.334 --> 00:29:30.935
THE HEAVY BURDEN FALLS IN

00:29:31.002 --> 00:29:32.203
CALIFORNIA'S EMPLOYERS.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:34.305
WHEN EMPLOYERS HAVE TO PAY MORE

00:29:34.372 --> 00:29:35.373
FOR HEALTHCARE COSTS THEY HAVE

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.275
LESS MONEY IN THEIR HIRING

00:29:37.342 --> 00:29:37.909
BUDGET?

00:29:37.976 --> 00:29:39.344
SO CALIFORNIA PAYS IN THE FORM

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:41.913
OF LOST JOBS LOWER WAGES AND OF

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.148
COURSE AT THE END OF THE DAY

00:29:43.214 --> 00:29:44.949
CALIFORNIA'S CITIZENS THEMSELVES

00:29:45.016 --> 00:29:46.918
HAVE TO PAY IN THE FORM OF

00:29:46.985 --> 00:29:48.520
HIGHER HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS.

00:29:48.586 --> 00:29:51.122
AND HIGHER OUT OF POCKET COSTS

00:29:51.189 --> 00:29:52.624
TO BUY MEDICINES BECAUSE VERY

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:55.059
SIMPLY THE PAY FOR DELAY DEALS

00:29:55.126 --> 00:29:56.828
ARE HELPING TO FUEL THE

00:29:56.895 --> 00:29:59.998
SKYROCKETING COSTS OF MEDICINE

00:30:00.064 --> 00:30:01.599
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:30:01.666 --> 00:30:02.467
QUITE SIMPLY IN A FREE MARKET

00:30:02.534 --> 00:30:04.669
ECONOMY WE WANT COMPETITORS

00:30:04.736 --> 00:30:07.805
EXPOSED TO FREE MARKET FORCES WE

00:30:07.872 --> 00:30:09.607
WANT THEM GOING HEAD TO HEAD TO

00:30:09.674 --> 00:30:11.876
DELIVER THE BEST PRODUCT FOR THE

00:30:11.943 --> 00:30:13.545
CHEAPEST PRICE FOR CONSUMERS.

00:30:13.611 --> 00:30:14.913
WE DON'T WANT COMPETITORS

00:30:14.979 --> 00:30:16.281
ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS TO KEEP

00:30:16.347 --> 00:30:17.982
CHEAPER MEDICINES OFF THE

00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:19.050
SHELVES.

00:30:19.117 --> 00:30:20.485
AND ONE DRUG COMPANIES AGREE

00:30:20.552 --> 00:30:21.953
THAT THE CHEAPER MARKET THE

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:22.754
CHEAPER DRUG TO STAY UP THE

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:24.822
MARKET WHAT'S GREAT THE TWO

00:30:24.889 --> 00:30:25.823
COMPANIES IS GREAT FOR BOTH

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:26.858
SIDES.

00:30:26.925 --> 00:30:28.660
THE REST OF US PAY AND PAY.

00:30:28.726 --> 00:30:29.827
SO I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER ONE

00:30:29.894 --> 00:30:31.729
OBSERVATION SPECIFICALLY ABOUT

00:30:31.796 --> 00:30:33.198
THE BILL THAT IS BEFORE THE

00:30:33.264 --> 00:30:35.066
COMMITTEE TODAY.

00:30:35.133 --> 00:30:36.935
IMPORTANTLY THE BILL DOES NOT

00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:38.803
FORBID PAY FOR DELAY SETTLEMENTS

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:41.172
BETWEEN BRADENTON AIR COMPANIES.

00:30:41.239 --> 00:30:42.907

HOWEVER THE TRANSPARENCY LAW

00:32:04.856 --> 00:32:06.257
DOESN'T ADDRESS DRUG PRICES THAT

00:32:06.324 --> 00:32:08.092
ARE ARTIFICIALLY HIGH BECAUSE OF

TO BRING COMPETITION IN TWENTY

00:38:53.297 --> 00:38:53.831
TWENTY THREE THIS IS ELEVEN

00:38:53.898 --> 00:38:54.932
YEARS EARLIER THAN THE

EXPIRATION OF THE PATENTS AND

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.035
OUR CONCERN IS THAT THE WAY THE

00:38:58.102 --> 00:38:59.270
BILL AS DRAFTED.

00:38:59.336 --> 00:39:00.805
THAT THAT SETTLEMENT WHICH WILL

00:39:00.871 --> 00:39:03.340
BRING A BY A SIMILAR TO HUMAN

00:39:03.407 --> 00:39:05.509
ERA -- ELEVEN YEARS BEFORE THE

00:39:05.576 --> 00:39:07.311
PATENT ACCESS WOULD BE DEEMED

00:39:07.378 --> 00:39:08.846
ILLEGAL.

00:39:08.913 --> 00:39:11.248
WE BELIEVE THAT -- THE BILL

00:39:11.315 --> 00:39:13.851
SHOULD ALLOW FOR PRO COMPETITIVE

00:39:13.918 --> 00:39:15.753
PATTON SETTLEMENTS AND AS IT'S

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.221
CURRENTLY DRAFTED THAT THE BILL

00:39:17.288 --> 00:39:19.056
WOULD NOT.

00:39:19.123 --> 00:39:19.857
AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE BILL

00:39:19.924 --> 00:39:21.058
WOULD MAKE IT PRESUMPTIVELY

00:39:21.125 --> 00:39:23.294
ILLEGAL TO SETTLE PATENT

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.629
LITIGATION EVEN IF IT EXCEPT

00:39:25.696 --> 00:39:27.631
EVEN IF IT ACCELERATES GENERIC

00:39:27.698 --> 00:39:28.899
ENTRY.

00:39:28.966 --> 00:39:31.635
IF ANYTHING OF VALUE INCLUDING

00:39:31.702 --> 00:39:34.205
CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS -- GOES

00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:34.772
TO THE GENERIC OR THE BY A

00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:37.041
SIMILAR THIS IS WHY THE SUPREME

00:39:37.108 --> 00:39:39.243
COURT OF THE UNITED STATES AND

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:40.845
THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAD

00:39:40.911 --> 00:39:42.646
SAID THAT THE PROPER WAY TO LOOK

00:39:42.713 --> 00:39:44.381
AT THESE TYPES OF SETTLEMENTS IS.

00:39:44.448 --> 00:39:46.016
IS THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED A RULE

00:39:46.083 --> 00:39:47.485
OF REASON ANALYSIS WHERE YOU

00:39:47.551 --> 00:39:48.986
LOOK AT THE PRO COMPETITIVE YOU

00:39:49.053 --> 00:39:50.321
LOOK AT THE ANTI COMPETITIVE

00:39:50.387 --> 00:39:51.956
THERE'S NOT A PRESUMPTION EITHER

00:39:52.022 --> 00:39:53.224
WAY BECAUSE THESE ARE VERY

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:56.060
COMPLICATED -- TRANSACTIONS.

00:39:56.127 --> 00:39:58.329
BECAUSE OF THE SUPREME COURT'S

00:39:58.395 --> 00:40:01.398
DECISION ACTIVISTS THE FTC HAS

00:40:01.465 --> 00:40:03.267
BEEN STUDYING THIS.

00:40:03.334 --> 00:40:05.169

A RESTRICTION ON GENERIC ENTRY

00:40:24.855 --> 00:40:26.390
THE F. T. C. CONCLUDED THAT THIS

00:40:26.457 --> 00:40:28.292
THIS IS THE LOWEST PROPORTION OF

00:40:28.359 --> 00:40:29.026
POTENTIAL.

00:40:29.093 --> 00:40:30.327

00:40:43.407 --> 00:40:44.642
THE ACTIVISTS DECISION IS

00:40:44.708 --> 00:40:46.610
WORKING THIS TYPE OF RULE OF

00:40:46.677 --> 00:40:48.946
REASON ANALYSIS IS ELIMINATING

00:40:49.013 --> 00:40:50.381
THE TYPES OF SETTLEMENTS THAT

AWAY SO THAT WE I DO.

00:43:47.825 --> 00:43:50.327

YESTERDAY IN SUB ONE WE TALKED

00:44:34.171 --> 00:44:36.707
ABOUT THE VERY ISSUE.

00:44:36.774 --> 00:44:38.208

IN THE END WE HAVE THE

00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:49.253
PROTECTION FOR THE CONSUMER --

00:44:49.319 --> 00:44:51.955
WE DO WANT TO BE ABLE TO TO WORK

00:44:52.022 --> 00:44:52.823

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES.

00:44:54.191 --> 00:44:55.626
BUT IN THE END OF THE PURPOSE OF

00:44:55.692 --> 00:44:58.095
THE BILL IS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS.

00:44:58.162 --> 00:45:04.068
AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT -- I

00:45:04.134 --> 00:45:06.503
HATE TO USE THE WORD COLLUSION

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:09.807
BUT JUST.

00:45:09.873 --> 00:45:10.340
EIGHTY EVERYTHING THAT WE

00:45:10.407 --> 00:45:11.975
LEARNED FROM THIS PARTICULAR

00:45:12.042 --> 00:45:14.411
BILL IS WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE

00:45:14.478 --> 00:45:16.480
SETTLEMENTS -- AS YOU'VE

00:45:16.547 --> 00:45:18.449
MENTIONED IT DOES PROVIDE IT'S

00:45:18.515 --> 00:45:20.017
IT'S A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION.

00:45:20.084 --> 00:45:21.351
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT'S THE

00:45:21.418 --> 00:45:22.719
END ALL THE IT IS A REBUTTABLE

00:45:22.786 --> 00:45:24.555
PRESUMPTION BUT I THINK THAT IT

00:45:24.621 --> 00:45:26.223
LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD WHEN

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:27.791
YOU HAVE THAT PRESUMPTION FROM

00:45:27.858 --> 00:45:29.093
THE VERY BEGINNING.

00:45:29.159 --> 00:45:31.128
THE IN THE AND WE'RE TALKING

00:45:31.195 --> 00:45:34.765

TALKING ABOUT LOTS OF THINGS BUT

00:45:35.699 --> 00:45:38.302
IN THE END IT'S THE CONSUMER

00:45:38.368 --> 00:45:39.470
THAT WE HAVE TO BE MOST

00:45:39.536 --> 00:45:41.505
CONCERNED WITH.

00:45:41.572 --> 00:45:44.341
AND HAVING THESE CONTROLS IS

00:45:44.408 --> 00:45:45.175
SOMETHING THAT IS VERY GOOD I

00:45:45.242 --> 00:45:47.544
THANK YOU FOR BRING IT FORWARD

00:45:47.611 --> 00:45:48.145
AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO MOVE

00:45:48.212 --> 00:45:49.613
THE BILL.

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.247
THANK YOU YOU HAVE A MOTION IS

00:45:50.314 --> 00:45:53.183

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:55.652
THANK YOU AT THE SITE

00:45:55.719 --> 00:45:55.953
[inaudible]

00:45:56.019 --> 00:45:57.855
MR OBERNOLTE.

I THANK YOU MISTER TERRACE

00:45:58.489 --> 00:45:59.857
SOMEONE AND I THINK THIS IS AN

00:45:59.923 --> 00:46:00.824
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT

00:46:00.891 --> 00:46:02.326
YOU HIGHLIGHTED AND I THINK

00:46:02.392 --> 00:46:03.627
YOU'RE DOING A REALLY GREAT JOB

00:46:03.694 --> 00:46:04.761
OF WORKING WITH.

00:46:04.828 --> 00:46:06.730
ALL SIDES TRYING CRAFTED A FAIR

00:46:06.797 --> 00:46:08.232
AND COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION TO IT

00:46:08.298 --> 00:46:09.566
AND I'M I'M TRYING TO GET TO A

00:46:09.633 --> 00:46:10.501
POSITION OF SUPPORT.

00:46:10.567 --> 00:46:12.803
I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:14.404
THE BILL'S SUPPORTERS ONE FOR

00:46:14.471 --> 00:46:17.074
HEALTH ACCESS AND ONE FOR THE AG

00:46:17.141 --> 00:46:24.648
IF WE COULD -- GET THEM BACK UP.

00:46:24.715 --> 00:46:27.284
SO FIRST FIRST HEALTH ACCESS WE

00:46:27.351 --> 00:46:30.053
HEARD THE OPPOSITION TESTIFIED

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.822
THAT GENERIC DRUG MANUFACTURERS

00:46:31.889 --> 00:46:32.689
FEEL.

00:46:32.756 --> 00:46:33.957
THAT THIS MIGHT HAVE A CHILLING

00:46:34.024 --> 00:46:35.492
EFFECT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF

00:46:35.559 --> 00:46:36.994
GENERICS BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:38.829
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS RESULT IN

00:46:38.896 --> 00:46:40.664
GENERICS BEING AVAILABLE EARLIER

00:46:40.731 --> 00:46:42.833
THAN THEY WOULD HAVE.

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.134
UNDER THE PATENT EXPIRATION.

00:46:44.201 --> 00:46:46.303
CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT CONCERN

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:46.904
BECAUSE THAT'S ALSO CONCERNED

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:50.507
THAT I SHARE -- TO HEALTH

00:46:50.574 --> 00:46:52.209
ACCESSORY YOU DON'T THINK SO ST

00:46:52.276 --> 00:46:59.516
OKAY -- SERVICES ON A WE

00:46:59.583 --> 00:47:00.984
DISAGREE THAT THE BILL WILL HAVE

00:47:01.051 --> 00:47:02.786
A CHILLING EFFECT -- AND THAT

00:47:02.853 --> 00:47:04.321
GENERICS WILL ACTUALLY NOT COME

00:47:04.388 --> 00:47:05.923
TO MARKET SOONER AND I CAN TURN

00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:08.458
IT OVER -- TO THE AG'S OFFICE TO

00:47:08.525 --> 00:47:09.426
PROVIDE MORE TECHNICAL

00:47:09.493 --> 00:47:12.629
ASSISTANCE THERE BUT WE DISAGREE

00:47:12.696 --> 00:47:15.032
WITH THAT -- AND IT'S CLEAR THAT

00:47:15.098 --> 00:47:16.900
THESE AGREEMENTS.

00:47:16.967 --> 00:47:19.002
PRO LONG THE TIME THAT THE BRAND

00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.937
NAME IS ON THE MARKET AND SORT

00:47:20.003 --> 00:47:23.040
OF THE GENERIC AND THE BILL --

00:47:23.106 --> 00:47:24.174
ADDRESSES THAT AN ALTERNATE OVER

00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:26.843
THE J. AG'S OFFICE TO PROVIDE

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:28.245
MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THERE.

00:47:28.312 --> 00:47:29.279
OR PERHAPS I COULD END THIS IS

00:47:29.346 --> 00:47:30.881
PROFESSOR FELDMAN.

00:47:30.948 --> 00:47:31.915
IT'S TOUGH TO BE GENERIC THESE

00:47:31.982 --> 00:47:33.951
DAYS THE INDUSTRY IS REELING

00:47:34.017 --> 00:47:35.919
FROM A VARIETY OF ANTI

00:47:35.986 --> 00:47:37.654
COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR SINCE.

00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:39.623
FROM BRAND NAME COMPANIES.

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:40.958
WE WANT THE GENERIC INDUSTRY TO

00:47:41.024 --> 00:47:44.261
THRIVE BY GETTING ITS PRODUCT ON

00:47:44.328 --> 00:47:45.996
THE MARKET AND SELLING CONSUMERS.

00:47:46.063 --> 00:47:48.198
IF THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN SURVIVE

00:47:48.265 --> 00:47:49.900
IS TO GET PAID BY OUR

00:47:49.967 --> 00:47:50.467
COMPETITORS TO STAY OFF THE

00:47:50.534 --> 00:47:51.301
MARKET.

00:47:51.368 --> 00:47:52.903
THAT'S NOT A SUSTAINABLE

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:54.905
BUSINESS MODEL THAT'S NOT WHAT

00:47:54.972 --> 00:47:57.307
WE WANT TO SEE FOR THAT INDUSTRY.

00:47:57.374 --> 00:48:00.177
SURE -- I THINK GO AHEAD SO I

00:48:00.244 --> 00:48:01.511
CHAU JOHNSON FOR THE AND I PRESS

00:48:01.578 --> 00:48:03.046
SECTION OF THE AG'S OFFICE ARE

00:48:03.113 --> 00:48:05.082
BILL SPECIFICALLY ALLOWS PRO

00:48:05.148 --> 00:48:07.117
COMPETITIVE -- PAPER DELAY

00:48:07.184 --> 00:48:09.319
AGREEMENTS IT'S SIMPLY SHIFTS

00:48:09.386 --> 00:48:10.988
THE BURDEN IS TO SHOW THAT

00:48:11.054 --> 00:48:12.956
CONSUMERS ARE BENEFITTED BY THAT

00:48:13.023 --> 00:48:15.292
PARTICULAR AGREEMENT.

00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:18.095
I KNOW THE MENTIONED THE HUMANE

00:48:18.161 --> 00:48:19.429
TREATMENT.

00:48:19.496 --> 00:48:20.497
AND AND CITED THAT IS AN EXAMPLE

00:48:20.564 --> 00:48:21.765
OF A POSSIBLE PRO COMPETITIVE

00:48:21.832 --> 00:48:22.532
AGREEMENT.

00:48:22.599 --> 00:48:23.834
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THERE

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:25.569
IS ANY PAYMENT AND THIS SO THIS

00:48:25.636 --> 00:48:27.170
BILL WOULD NOT REALLY.

00:48:27.237 --> 00:48:29.206
IMPACT AN AGREEMENT WHERE THE

00:48:29.273 --> 00:48:33.277
PARTIES HAVE LOOKED AT THE

00:48:33.343 --> 00:48:35.912
PATENTS AND MADE.

00:48:35.979 --> 00:48:36.847
OF THE STATE THAT THE PATENTS

00:48:36.913 --> 00:48:37.514
AND SETTLED THIS DOESN'T PREVENT

00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:39.016
THAT AT ALL THE FACT THIS

00:48:39.082 --> 00:48:43.353
ENCOURAGES THE PARTIES TO SETTLE

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:46.290
ON THOSE LINES WITHOUT PAYING

00:48:46.356 --> 00:48:46.590
[inaudible]

00:48:46.657 --> 00:48:49.393
OKAY -- BUT I THINK THAT THEY

00:48:49.459 --> 00:48:50.227
KNOW THE THE BILL ENCOMPASSES

00:48:50.294 --> 00:48:53.463
THE DESIRE. TO TO ALLOW PRO

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:54.598
COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR WOULD AND

00:48:54.665 --> 00:48:56.433
AVOID ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:57.801
BY THE EXEMPTION THAT'S IN THERE

00:48:57.868 --> 00:49:00.570
BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE -- YOU

00:49:00.637 --> 00:49:02.306
MISTER WOULD TO WORK WITH THE

00:49:02.372 --> 00:49:03.874
GENERIC DRUG MANUFACTURERS AND

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:04.941
MAKE SURE THAT HERE'S ENOUGH

00:49:05.008 --> 00:49:06.843
LATITUDE IN THE PROOF PROVISIONS

00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:08.912
OF THE EXEMPTION -- THAT THEY

00:49:08.979 --> 00:49:10.280
HAVE THE ROOM TO BE ABLE TO DO

00:49:10.347 --> 00:49:11.248
THAT BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE

00:49:11.315 --> 00:49:12.349
SURE THAT CONSUMERS GET THE

00:49:12.416 --> 00:49:13.850
BENEFIT OF EARLY ACCESS TO

00:49:13.917 --> 00:49:15.886
GENERIC DRUGS AND WE WOULDN'T

00:49:15.952 --> 00:49:16.520
WANT TO STAND IN THE WAY THAT.

00:49:16.586 --> 00:49:17.587
YOU AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:49:17.654 --> 00:49:18.922
QUESTION IN YOUR COMMENTS AND I

00:49:18.989 --> 00:49:20.891
ABSOLUTELY WILL CONTINUE IN THAT

00:49:20.957 --> 00:49:22.259
IN THAT DIRECTION.

00:49:22.326 --> 00:49:23.894
I THINK THAT YOU KNOW SOME OF

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:25.028
WHAT YOU'VE HEARD TODAY -- IS

00:49:25.095 --> 00:49:26.463
ACTUALLY A WHOLE NOTHER LAYER OF

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:28.332
THE ONION THAT THAT THAT WE

00:49:28.398 --> 00:49:30.100
COULD PEEL OFF BUT WE'RE NOT AND

00:49:30.167 --> 00:49:31.335
THAT'S AROUND THE PATENTS AND

00:49:31.401 --> 00:49:32.736
THERE ARE PATENTS THEIR FILE

00:49:32.803 --> 00:49:34.905
BETTER WE CALL WEAK PATENTS.

00:49:34.971 --> 00:49:36.473
THAT MAKE IT -- AND THAT REALLY

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:39.042
OBSTACLES -- FOR EVERYONE --

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:40.377
THEY'RE DIFFICULT TO FIGHT

00:49:40.444 --> 00:49:42.112
THEY'RE EXPENSIVE -- AND THEY

00:49:42.179 --> 00:49:43.814
AND THEY PROTECT THE BRAND NAME

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.449
EVEN MORE AND SO WE'RE WE'RE

00:49:45.515 --> 00:49:47.017
FOCUSED ON ONE ONE ISSUE HERE

00:49:47.084 --> 00:49:48.652
AND THAT IS THESE AND WHAT WE

00:49:48.719 --> 00:49:49.653
BELIEVE OR NOT.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:51.088
OR ANTI COMPETITIVE --

00:49:51.154 --> 00:49:53.457
ACTIVITIES AND THAT'S THAT'S

00:49:53.523 --> 00:49:54.958
WHERE FOLKS ON HERE BECAUSE WE

00:49:55.025 --> 00:49:55.992
THINK IT'S GOOD FOR CONSUMER

00:49:56.059 --> 00:49:58.295
WELL I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR

00:49:58.362 --> 00:49:59.463
FUTURE LEGISLATION ON THAT TOPIC.

00:49:59.529 --> 00:50:01.631
MY SECOND QUESTION IS FOR THE

00:50:01.698 --> 00:50:07.270
ATTORNEY GENERAL AND I

00:50:07.337 --> 00:50:08.305
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THE AG IS

00:50:08.372 --> 00:50:08.905
GONNA BE EMPOWERED UNDER THIS

00:50:08.972 --> 00:50:09.539
BILL TO ENFORCE THE PROVISIONS

00:50:09.606 --> 00:50:10.307
OF THE BILL.

00:50:10.374 --> 00:50:11.875
BUT THERE'S ALSO A PART OF THE

00:50:11.942 --> 00:50:12.509
BILL.

00:50:12.576 --> 00:50:14.444
THAT GIVES THIRD PARTIES THE

00:50:14.511 --> 00:50:16.580
ABILITY TO SUE UNDER THE UNFAIR

00:50:16.646 --> 00:50:18.048
PRACTICES ACT.

00:50:18.115 --> 00:50:19.182
A FOUR DAY ADDITIONAL DAMAGES

00:50:19.249 --> 00:50:21.284
I'M WONDERING WHY THAT'S IN

00:50:21.351 --> 00:50:22.586
THERE BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE THE

00:50:22.652 --> 00:50:24.287
UNIVERSE OF DRUG MANUFACTURERS

00:50:24.354 --> 00:50:26.089
BEING SO SMALL THAT THE ATTORNEY

00:50:26.156 --> 00:50:27.391
GENERAL WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE

00:50:27.457 --> 00:50:29.593
VENUE TO BRING SUIT AND TO

00:50:29.659 --> 00:50:31.461
ENFORCE THE MEASURES OF THE BILL.

00:50:31.528 --> 00:50:32.896
WELL CERTAINLY THE ATTORNEY

00:50:32.963 --> 00:50:36.166
GENERAL CANNOT BE EVERYWHERE AND

00:50:36.233 --> 00:50:37.768
THEY CANNOT GO AFTER A LIVE

00:50:37.834 --> 00:50:38.935
THESE AGREEMENTS.

00:50:39.002 --> 00:50:40.771
EVEN WITH THIS BILL THESE CASES

00:50:40.837 --> 00:50:43.006
ARE GOING TO BE EXTREMELY

00:50:43.073 --> 00:50:45.575
RESOURCE INTENSIVE -- TAKE THE

00:50:45.642 --> 00:50:47.978
EXAMPLE THE FTC OVER THE LAST

00:50:48.044 --> 00:50:48.979
FOUR YEARS.

00:50:49.045 --> 00:50:51.114
LAST NINE YEARS AS ONLY BROUGHT

00:50:51.181 --> 00:50:52.482
FOR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS THEY

00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:54.785
TYPICALLY HAVE TO HAVE. THIRTY

00:50:54.851 --> 00:50:55.419
FIVE ATTORNEY SAID EVEN THOUGH

00:50:55.485 --> 00:50:57.354
WE'VE ADJUSTED THE BURDEN OF

00:50:57.421 --> 00:50:58.722
PROOF THEY'RE STILL GOING TO BE.

00:50:58.789 --> 00:51:01.391
IS SUBSTANTIAL EXPERTISE AND

00:51:01.458 --> 00:51:06.263
YEARS OF LITIGATION WE HAVE JUST

00:51:06.329 --> 00:51:08.432
CHANGED.

00:51:08.498 --> 00:51:10.267
SAME FIELD SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT

00:51:10.333 --> 00:51:10.867
MORE THAN.

00:51:10.934 --> 00:51:12.903
AND SO WE STILL ANTICIPATE THAT

00:51:12.969 --> 00:51:14.271
WHAT EVER ENFORCEMENT IS DONE BY

00:51:14.337 --> 00:51:14.971
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

00:51:15.038 --> 00:51:16.506
IS GOING TO NEED TO BE

00:51:16.573 --> 00:51:18.608
SUPPLEMENTED BY PRIVATE

00:51:18.675 --> 00:51:20.143
LITIGANTS.

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:22.345
YEAH BUT THIS -- DOES NOT ALTER

00:51:22.412 --> 00:51:25.315
THE PENALTIES AT THAT ARE MADE

00:51:25.382 --> 00:51:26.216
AVAILABLE UNDER THE HEART RIGHT

00:51:26.283 --> 00:51:28.251
AFTER.

00:51:28.318 --> 00:51:31.655
THE UNFAIR PRACTICES

00:51:31.721 --> 00:51:31.955
[inaudible]

00:51:32.022 --> 00:51:33.557
OKAY SO.

00:51:33.623 --> 00:51:35.225
IF I COULD I FOLLOW UP WITH WHAT

00:51:35.292 --> 00:51:36.726
MY COLLEAGUE SAID -- YOU KNOW

00:51:36.793 --> 00:51:37.494
ONE THING TO ALSO CONSIDER

00:51:37.561 --> 00:51:38.562
ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS THAT --

00:51:38.628 --> 00:51:40.397
CURRENTLY UNDER CURRENT LAW THE

00:51:40.464 --> 00:51:41.765
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION EXISTS

00:51:41.832 --> 00:51:43.467
AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

00:51:43.533 --> 00:51:45.735
ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF

00:51:45.802 --> 00:51:48.371
LAW IS REALLY THE SUBJECT MATTER

00:51:48.438 --> 00:51:49.973
EXPERTISE THAT'S INVOLVED AND SO

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:50.941
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:51:51.007 --> 00:51:55.011
A HANDFUL OF ATTORNEYS THAT

00:51:55.078 --> 00:51:55.779
COULD BRING THIS TYPE OF CASE

00:51:55.846 --> 00:51:56.780
THAT HAVE EXPERTISE IN PATENT

00:51:56.847 --> 00:51:59.115
LAW AND ANTI TRUST LAW AND

00:51:59.182 --> 00:51:59.783
REALLY GET AS AS OF MY COLLEAGUE

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:02.052
NOTE NOTED THE EXPENSE OF THESE

00:52:02.118 --> 00:52:04.488
CASES REALLY IT'S IT'S VERY FEW

00:52:04.554 --> 00:52:06.122
TYPES OF PLAINTIFFS -- THAT CAN

00:52:06.189 --> 00:52:07.357
BRING THIS KIND OF ACTION SO

00:52:07.424 --> 00:52:09.693
WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE KIND OF

00:52:09.759 --> 00:52:10.560
PLAYER IF.

00:52:10.627 --> 00:52:13.029
IN RATHER IN ORDER TO DETERMINE

00:52:13.096 --> 00:52:14.064
THE CORRECT TYPE OF PLAYER FOR

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:16.199
ASIAN OF THESE AGREEMENTS WE WE

00:52:16.266 --> 00:52:18.768
NEED THE ABILITY FOR THEIR TO BE

00:52:18.835 --> 00:52:19.870
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN

00:52:19.936 --> 00:52:21.638
ADDITION TO WHAT THE ATTORNEY

00:52:21.705 --> 00:52:23.740
GENERAL CAN BRING -- BECAUSE IS

00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:25.242
AS MISS JOHNSON NOTED ON THERE

00:52:25.308 --> 00:52:27.010
THERE'S NO WAY FOR GOVERNMENT TO

00:52:27.077 --> 00:52:29.846
BE EVERYWHERE AT ALL THE TIME.

00:52:29.913 --> 00:52:30.447
RIGHT SO.

00:52:30.514 --> 00:52:32.449
THE WHOLE REASON FOR HAVING A

00:52:32.516 --> 00:52:34.117
BILL LIKE THIS IS BECAUSE WE

00:52:34.184 --> 00:52:35.752
DON'T WANT THERE TO BE A PROFIT

00:52:35.819 --> 00:52:37.721
MOTIVE TO KEEP GENERIC DRUGS OFF

00:52:37.787 --> 00:52:38.755
THE MARKET.

00:52:38.822 --> 00:52:41.157
BUT LIKE WHY IS -- I DON'T THINK

00:52:41.224 --> 00:52:42.392
WE WANT TO CREATE A PROFIT

00:52:42.459 --> 00:52:45.328
MOTIVE FOR PREDATORY LAW FIRMS.

00:52:45.395 --> 00:52:47.130
TO GO RAKE PHARMACEUTICAL

00:52:47.197 --> 00:52:48.798
MANUFACTURERS WHO AREN'T BEING

00:52:48.865 --> 00:52:50.400
ANTI COMPETITIVE OVER THE COALS

00:52:50.467 --> 00:52:52.235
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE UNFAIR

00:52:52.302 --> 00:52:54.838
PRACTICES ACT THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:52:54.905 --> 00:52:56.806
LAW FIRMS THAT ARE GOOD ACTORS

00:52:56.873 --> 00:52:58.208
IN THAT RESPECT AND THERE ARE A

00:52:58.275 --> 00:52:58.808
FEW THAT.

00:52:58.875 --> 00:53:00.744
ACTIVELY GO OUT AND SEEK THESE

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:02.012
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PROFIT

00:53:02.078 --> 00:53:02.879
MOTIVE NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:53:02.946 --> 00:53:04.414
TRYING TO IMPROVE THE PLAYING

00:53:04.481 --> 00:53:05.782
FIELD FOR CONSUMERS.

00:53:05.849 --> 00:53:07.951
SO -- IT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

00:53:08.018 --> 00:53:10.754
AG DOESN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:12.255
GO AFTER.

00:53:12.322 --> 00:53:13.790
THE THE THEY IS THE

00:53:13.857 --> 00:53:14.824
PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS

00:53:14.891 --> 00:53:16.159
THAT WE THINK ARE BEING ABUSIVE

00:53:16.226 --> 00:53:17.694
I WOULD LIKE US TO GIVE YOU MORE

00:53:17.761 --> 00:53:19.796
RESOURCES TO DO THAT RATHER THAN

00:53:19.863 --> 00:53:23.199
TO RELY ON PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS

00:53:23.266 --> 00:53:25.001
WHO MAY NOT HAVE THE BEST

00:53:25.068 --> 00:53:25.602
INTEREST OF THE CONSUMER APART

00:53:25.669 --> 00:53:26.436
SO.

00:53:26.503 --> 00:53:27.904
I MEAN IF IF I VOTED AGAINST THE

00:53:27.971 --> 00:53:28.838
BILL THIS WOULD BE THE REASON

00:53:28.905 --> 00:53:30.140
BECAUSE I'M A BIT CONCERNED

00:53:30.206 --> 00:53:30.640
ABOUT THAT SO I'M GONNA

00:53:30.707 --> 00:53:31.741
SUPPORTER TODAY I THOUGHT I'D

00:53:31.808 --> 00:53:33.076
LIKE TO ENCOURAGE YOU.

00:53:33.143 --> 00:53:34.744
ASSEMBLYMAN WOULD TO AS THE BILL

00:53:34.811 --> 00:53:36.212
MOVES FORWARD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER --

00:53:36.279 --> 00:53:37.581
TONING THAT PART OF THE BILL

00:53:37.647 --> 00:53:38.848
DOWN BECAUSE I WOULD I THINK THE

00:53:38.915 --> 00:53:39.616
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S THE

00:53:39.683 --> 00:53:41.985
APPROPRIATE VENUE TO BRING SUIT

00:53:42.052 --> 00:53:42.586
TO ENFORCE THE PROVISIONS THE

00:53:42.652 --> 00:53:43.019
BILL.

00:53:43.086 --> 00:53:44.421
BUT I THINK YOU I THANK YOU FOR

00:53:44.487 --> 00:53:45.622
YOUR CONCERN I WOULD JUST NOTE

00:53:45.689 --> 00:53:47.090
THAT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION

00:53:47.157 --> 00:53:49.960
DOES EXIST ALREADY -- AND THE

00:53:50.026 --> 00:53:51.227
PEOPLE THAT WOULD LIKELY BRING

00:53:51.294 --> 00:53:52.429
SUIT OTHER THAN THE ATTORNEY

00:53:52.495 --> 00:53:55.432
GENERAL OR PEOPLE LIKE EMPLOYERS --

00:53:55.498 --> 00:53:58.802
PAYERS -- LABOR UNIONS -- HARDLY

00:53:58.868 --> 00:54:00.570
YOU KNOW CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT --

00:54:00.637 --> 00:54:02.405
TYPE THINGS AND PARTLY BECAUSE

00:54:02.472 --> 00:54:04.441
THE COST OF LITIGATING THESE IS

00:54:04.507 --> 00:54:06.910
SO HIGH IT MAY COST FIVE TO TEN

00:54:06.977 --> 00:54:07.811
MILLION DOLLARS IN EXPERT

00:54:07.877 --> 00:54:09.512
WITNESSES ALONE TO TRY CASES

00:54:09.579 --> 00:54:09.980
LIKE THIS.

00:54:10.046 --> 00:54:13.083
SO THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF CASE

00:54:13.149 --> 00:54:14.384
THAT IS GOING TO BE -- BROUGHT

00:54:14.451 --> 00:54:15.952
WITH FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS THESE

00:54:16.019 --> 00:54:17.287
ARE THESE ARE REALLY DIFFICULT

00:54:17.354 --> 00:54:19.589
CASES -- TO UNRAVEL AND THAT'S

00:54:19.656 --> 00:54:22.225
PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

00:54:22.292 --> 00:54:23.560
IS TO CHANGE THE BURDEN OF PROOF

00:54:23.627 --> 00:54:24.227
HERE.

00:54:24.294 --> 00:54:25.629
ON THIS AD TO SAY YOU KNOW THESE

00:54:25.695 --> 00:54:26.963
ARE NOT ANTI COMPETITIVE

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:28.632
AGREEMENTS THEN THEN SHOW US

00:54:28.698 --> 00:54:31.267
INSTEAD OF HIDING BEHIND -- THE

00:54:31.334 --> 00:54:33.103
EGGS THE THE CURRENT THE CURRENT

00:54:33.169 --> 00:54:34.638
STATUS QUO AND SO WE'RE TRYING

00:54:34.704 --> 00:54:36.539
TO SHIFT THIS PENDULUM -- IN

00:54:36.606 --> 00:54:39.142
FAVOR OF CONSUMERS -- WERE IT

00:54:39.209 --> 00:54:40.710
CLEARLY ISN'T RIGHT NOW I THINK

00:54:40.777 --> 00:54:42.078
WELL I I RESPECT YOUR OPTIMISM

00:54:42.145 --> 00:54:43.813
THAT IT WOULD NOT BE ABUSED BUT

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:45.181
EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT HAS BEEN

00:54:45.248 --> 00:54:45.949
ABUSED.

00:54:46.016 --> 00:54:47.384
IN OTHER VENUES AND THAT'S WHY

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:53.757
I'M SO CAUTIOUS ABOUT IT BUT I

00:54:53.823 --> 00:54:54.357
THANK YOU FOR THE GOOD WORK ON

00:54:54.424 --> 00:54:55.091
THE BILL.

00:54:55.158 --> 00:54:55.592
WELL WHILE WE'RE BASHING

00:54:55.659 --> 00:54:56.493
ATTORNEYS I THINK WE SHOULD ALSO

00:54:56.559 --> 00:54:57.293
POINT OUT THAT WHAT WAS.

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.294
WHAT WAS MENTIONED THERE THE

00:54:58.361 --> 00:54:59.095
THESE THE HIGH PRICE PREDATORY

00:54:59.162 --> 00:55:00.263
ATTORNEYS OFTEN HAPPEN ON THE

00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:01.731
SIDE OF THE VERY LARGE DRUG

00:55:01.798 --> 00:55:03.199
COMPANIES HERE BECAUSE?

00:55:03.266 --> 00:55:04.901
UNFORTUNATELY THE PATENT LAWS

00:55:04.968 --> 00:55:06.336
HAVE OFTEN BEEN USED.

00:55:06.403 --> 00:55:09.139
STRATEGICALLY PAT PROSECUTION IS

00:55:09.205 --> 00:55:10.073
USED TO TEACH ECCLES BY THE HIGH

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:12.308
PRICE LAW FIRMS IN ORDER TO

00:55:12.375 --> 00:55:14.577
ENFORCE REINFORCED A COMPETITIVE

00:55:14.644 --> 00:55:16.346
ADVANTAGE IN THE MARKETPLACE

00:55:16.413 --> 00:55:18.281
WHAT THIS BILL DOES BECAUSE WERE

00:55:18.348 --> 00:55:21.217
SHIPPING IT. TO ANTI TRUST IS

00:55:21.284 --> 00:55:23.086
BALANCE SOME OF THAT OUT BECAUSE

00:55:23.153 --> 00:55:24.621
THE LARGE CORPORATIONS WITH THE

00:55:24.688 --> 00:55:26.523
LARGE BANK ACCOUNTS HAVE THE

00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:28.224
ABILITY TO STRATEGICALLY GO

00:55:28.291 --> 00:55:29.259
AFTER.

00:55:29.325 --> 00:55:31.995
VERY SMALL PATTON'S IS A WAY OF

00:55:32.062 --> 00:55:33.897
BLOCKING ANYBODY ELSE FROM

00:55:33.963 --> 00:55:35.331
GETTING INTO THE GENERIC MARKET.

00:55:35.398 --> 00:55:37.167
THAT'S THE COMPLEXITY OF OF

00:55:37.233 --> 00:55:39.302
PATENT LAW SO YOUR COMPLAINT IS

00:55:39.369 --> 00:55:41.404
ACTUALLY MORE HAS BEEN MORE

00:55:41.471 --> 00:55:42.872
ABUSED ON THE SIDE OF PAT

00:55:42.939 --> 00:55:45.341
PROSECUTION.

00:55:45.408 --> 00:55:47.377
AS OPPOSED TO PATENT.

00:55:47.444 --> 00:55:48.778
ENFORCEMENT FOR SMALL COMPANIES

00:55:48.845 --> 00:55:51.948
TRYING TO FIND THEIR THEIR NICHE.

00:55:52.015 --> 00:55:53.817
SO MS GONZALEZ AND THEN AS

00:55:53.883 --> 00:55:54.651
PETRIE-NORRIS IN THE MISTER

00:55:54.718 --> 00:55:55.085
CHILD.

00:55:55.151 --> 00:55:57.020
THE CHAIR OF HELP ME UNDERSTAND

00:55:57.087 --> 00:55:59.489
MY QUESTION MORE AND I'M ALWAYS

00:55:59.556 --> 00:56:01.224
A CLEAR WHEN I DON'T.

00:56:01.291 --> 00:56:03.693
UNDERSTAND A PORCH IN THE LAW.

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:05.161
I DON'T REMEMBER LEARNING THIS

00:56:05.228 --> 00:56:06.463
IN LAW SCHOOL I MIGHT HAVE SLEPT

00:56:06.529 --> 00:56:09.165
THROUGH THIS PORTION -- IT'S

00:56:09.232 --> 00:56:10.266
VERY DENSE AND I'M SMART ENOUGH

00:56:10.333 --> 00:56:12.202
TO ADMIT WHEN I DON'T KNOW

00:56:12.268 --> 00:56:14.437
SOMETHING SELMA START WITH THAT --

00:56:14.504 --> 00:56:16.372
NO EXPERIENCS Là THE VALUES I

00:56:16.439 --> 00:56:18.975
UNDERSTAND I'M WITH YOU I SECOND

00:56:19.042 --> 00:56:19.776
I'M GONNA VOTE WITH US.

00:56:19.843 --> 00:56:21.678
BUT I'M TRYING TO GET TO WHAT

00:56:21.745 --> 00:56:23.580
CAN OR MAYBE IS BEING TALKED

00:56:23.646 --> 00:56:25.482
ABOUT BEING FIXED AND ONE OF MY

00:56:25.548 --> 00:56:27.584
QUESTIONS -- HAD TO DO I MEAN

00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:34.491
MAYBE I UNDERESTIMATED -- OR

00:56:34.557 --> 00:56:35.725
MAYBE OVER ESTIMATE WHAT TAKES

00:56:35.792 --> 00:56:36.359
TO GET A PATENT BUT IT HAS TO

00:56:36.426 --> 00:56:36.993
WITH THE PRESUMPTION OF VALIDITY

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:37.894
OF THE PATENT.

00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:39.629
I UNDERSTAND THE REASON THE

00:56:39.696 --> 00:56:41.498
REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION -- WHEN

00:56:41.564 --> 00:56:43.366
IT COMES TO THE ANTI COMPETITIVE

00:56:43.433 --> 00:56:45.335
BEHAVIOR BUT?

00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:46.636
I AID DON'T.

00:56:46.703 --> 00:56:49.205
UNDERSTAND THE VILLAGE DIDN'T

00:56:49.272 --> 00:56:50.774
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME LIKE.

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:51.975
MAYBE I SHOULD BE ASKING NO GO

00:56:52.041 --> 00:56:55.078
AHEAD OKAY MAYBE YOU CAN ANSWER

00:56:55.145 --> 00:56:56.579
SHE'S GOT THE ANSWER OKAY.

00:56:56.646 --> 00:56:58.648
SO WHY WHY IS THAT NECESSARY FOR

00:56:58.715 --> 00:56:59.616
THE JUDGE AND JURY THE THE

00:56:59.682 --> 00:57:00.183
PRESUMPTION OF VALIDITY THE

00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:02.085
POUND.

00:57:02.152 --> 00:57:03.319
SURE -- AND AND GOSH I HOPE YOU

00:57:03.386 --> 00:57:04.254
NEVER FELL ASLEEP IN ANY OF ANY

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.122
OF MY CLASSES IN IT OR AYE AYE

00:57:06.189 --> 00:57:07.123
MIGRATED ACTUALLY FALSELY BUT

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:08.691
THIS IS REALLY I MEAN TO TRY TO

00:57:08.758 --> 00:57:10.760
GET TO THE LEGAL ISSUES HERE IS

00:57:10.827 --> 00:57:11.628
REALLY.

00:57:11.694 --> 00:57:14.264
NOT MY SPECIALTY I'M ALWAYS I'LL

00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:16.633
BUT TALK ABOUT LABOR LAW EVERY

00:57:16.699 --> 00:57:19.302
DAY OF THE WEEK BUT THERE WAS

00:57:19.369 --> 00:57:20.370
ONLY START WITH THE THIRTY

00:57:20.436 --> 00:57:20.904
THOUSAND FOOT VIEW IN THE

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:21.571
TOXICITY CLEA -- ABOUT THAT THE

00:57:21.638 --> 00:57:23.706
THE PRESUMPTIONS IN THE BILL --

00:57:23.773 --> 00:57:25.542
ARE THERE TO HELP THE COURTS TO

00:57:25.608 --> 00:57:26.943
GET TO WHAT THIS IS ABOUT AND

00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:28.411
THAT IS IF YOU'RE GOING TO PAY

00:57:28.478 --> 00:57:30.346
YOUR COMPETITOR TO STAY OFF THE

00:57:30.413 --> 00:57:30.947
MARKET.

00:57:31.014 --> 00:57:32.282
YOU NEED TO SHOW US THAT THERE

00:57:32.348 --> 00:57:34.117
IS A GOOD PROGRAM HEADED OF

00:57:34.184 --> 00:57:35.151
REASON TO DO IT THAT'S THAT'S

00:57:35.218 --> 00:57:36.186
WHAT THE LOSS IS SUPPOSED TO BE

00:57:36.252 --> 00:57:36.986
ABOUT.

00:57:37.053 --> 00:57:37.887
AND THE YOU KNOW THAT THAT

00:57:37.954 --> 00:57:38.922
SWEEPS ASIDE SOME OF THE THINGS

00:57:38.988 --> 00:57:40.623
THAT COURTS HAVE GOTTEN CONFUSED

00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:41.691
ABOUT.

00:57:41.758 --> 00:57:43.159
I BUT I DO WANT TO ADDRESS YOUR

00:57:43.226 --> 00:57:44.828
YOUR ISSUE ABOUT PATENTS --

00:57:44.894 --> 00:57:47.964
BECAUSE THE SYSTEM FOR RAPID

00:57:48.031 --> 00:57:49.799
ENTRY OF GENERIC DRUGS WAS

00:57:49.866 --> 00:57:51.601
DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE GENERIC

00:57:51.668 --> 00:57:53.603
DRUG COMPANIES TO DO BATTLE

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:55.205
AGAINST THE BIG GUNS.

00:57:55.271 --> 00:57:56.673
AND CONGRESS RECOGNIZE THAT

00:57:56.739 --> 00:57:58.141
THERE ARE A LOT OF PATENTS OUT

00:57:58.208 --> 00:58:00.043
THERE THAT ARE NOT VALID AND

00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:01.144
THEY'RE A LOT FANS OUT THERE

00:58:01.211 --> 00:58:02.579
THAT MAY BE VALID BUT DON'T

00:58:02.645 --> 00:58:04.547
APPLY TO PARTICULAR GENERIC

00:58:04.614 --> 00:58:05.248
DRUGS.

00:58:05.315 --> 00:58:08.351
SO THERE ARE -- OF INCENTIVES

00:58:08.418 --> 00:58:10.420
CREATED WITHIN THE LAW TO PUSH

00:58:10.486 --> 00:58:12.088
GENERICS AMOUNT OF THESE

00:58:12.155 --> 00:58:13.489
CHALLENGES IN COURT.

00:58:13.556 --> 00:58:15.291
NOW THE BRAND DRUG COMPANIES

00:58:15.358 --> 00:58:17.227
HAVE FOUND IN AND RUN ABOUT THEM

00:58:17.293 --> 00:58:18.494
DON'T DON'T FIGHT IT OUT IN

00:58:18.561 --> 00:58:20.396
COURT -- WIFI TO NURSING COURT

00:58:20.463 --> 00:58:22.565
JUST JUST PAY THEM HANDSOMELY

00:58:22.632 --> 00:58:23.700
AND THEN LET THEM AGREE TO STAY

00:58:23.766 --> 00:58:25.201
OFF THE THE MARKET.

00:58:25.268 --> 00:58:26.569
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON IF ALL

00:58:26.636 --> 00:58:31.174
PATENTS WERE GOOD AND SOLID.

00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:32.475
WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM

00:58:32.542 --> 00:58:32.775
[inaudible]

00:58:32.842 --> 00:58:34.711
ALL RIGHT.

00:58:34.777 --> 00:58:37.881
SO WE JUST HAND OUT PATENTS ARE.

00:58:37.947 --> 00:58:40.483
ANYTHING AT THE AYE I DIDN'T

00:58:40.550 --> 00:58:42.652
KNOW THIS THIS IS OUR YEAH WELL

00:58:42.719 --> 00:58:45.989
SO.

00:58:46.055 --> 00:58:49.192
IT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

00:58:49.259 --> 00:58:50.360
AND HAVE IT ANSWERED BY MAYBE

00:58:50.426 --> 00:58:52.095
MORE ON A PASSING ANYONE EVER

00:58:52.161 --> 00:58:52.462
WANTS TO KNOW.

00:58:52.528 --> 00:58:53.630
WELL I THINK THE FACT THAT YOU

00:58:53.696 --> 00:58:54.230
HAVE DRUGS WHICH CLAIMED THERE

00:58:54.297 --> 00:58:55.498
ARE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX

00:58:55.565 --> 00:58:56.332
PATENTS THAT COVER.

00:58:56.399 --> 00:58:58.902
A SINGLE DRUG SUGGEST YOU THAT

00:58:58.968 --> 00:59:01.638
MAY BE TOO MANY PATENTS SERBIAN

00:59:01.704 --> 00:59:03.940
ISSUED OR MAYBE TOO MANY.

00:59:04.007 --> 00:59:05.842
ARE BEING USED TO CLAIM

00:59:05.909 --> 00:59:08.711
PROTECTION FOR THE DRUG WE HAVE --

00:59:08.778 --> 00:59:10.914
INSTANCES WHERE YOU HAVEN'T AND

00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:12.348
CHAPTER FOR INSTANCE SENDING

00:59:12.415 --> 00:59:13.883
CHECKS AT THE NORTH FROM MARK

00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:14.584
INSULIN.

00:59:14.651 --> 00:59:15.785
AND YET EACH OF THOSE LITTLE

00:59:15.852 --> 00:59:17.453
NEEDLES THAT HAVE BEEN IN USE

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:19.956
FOR FOR YEARS MAY HAVE FIFTEEN

00:59:20.023 --> 00:59:20.523
OR TWENTY PATENTS THAT THEY

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:20.990
CLAIM.

00:59:21.057 --> 00:59:23.259
COVER VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THEM SO

00:59:23.326 --> 00:59:24.727
THESE PATENTS ARE OFTEN VERY

00:59:24.794 --> 00:59:27.931
NARROW AND THE GENERIC CAN WORK

00:59:27.997 --> 00:59:29.065
AROUND THEM OR DOESN'T INFRINGE

00:59:29.132 --> 00:59:31.467
THEM BUT YET THEY CLOG.

00:59:31.534 --> 00:59:34.270
THE THEY STOP COMPETITION SO

00:59:34.337 --> 00:59:35.705
THAT THE SCHEME OF OUR

00:59:35.772 --> 00:59:37.573
PHARMACEUTICAL LAWS WAS TO

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:39.075
ENCOURAGE THE GENERICS.

00:59:39.142 --> 00:59:41.711
WHO BEST KNOW WHAT THOSE PATENT

00:59:41.778 --> 00:59:43.279
WHICH PANTS ARE GOOD WHICH ONES

00:59:43.346 --> 00:59:45.114
COVER WHAT THEY MIGHT DO? TO

00:59:45.181 --> 00:59:47.417
CHALLENGE THE PATENTS AND FREE

00:59:47.483 --> 00:59:49.485
THEM FREE UP THE MARKET PLACE

00:59:49.552 --> 00:59:55.024
FOR OTHERS TO IT FOR GENERIC

00:59:55.091 --> 00:59:55.425
ENTRY [inaudible]

00:59:55.491 --> 00:59:59.562
BUT LETTER TO I I WILL I WOULD

00:59:59.629 --> 01:00:00.430
LOVE TO HEAR ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE --

01:00:00.496 --> 01:00:00.997
AS WELL WELL IT'S A SIMILAR

01:00:01.064 --> 01:00:01.898
PERSPECTIVE WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:02.899
PATENT SYSTEM AND OUR COMPANY IS

01:00:02.966 --> 01:00:03.499
THE GENERIC MANUFACTURERS ARE

01:00:03.566 --> 01:00:04.167
CONSTANTLY.

01:00:04.233 --> 01:00:06.302
DOING BATTLE IN COURT AGAINST

01:00:06.369 --> 01:00:07.837
OUR FOR OUR FRIENDS FROM THE THE

01:00:07.904 --> 01:00:10.006
BRANDED SIDE OF THE ECOSYSTEM

01:00:10.073 --> 01:00:12.909
AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE DOZENS OF

01:00:12.976 --> 01:00:14.610
PATENTS THAT ARE AT STAKE.

01:00:14.677 --> 01:00:16.679
IN THE MOST MODERN BIOTECHNOLOGY

01:00:16.746 --> 01:00:20.149
DRUGS THESE PATENTS COST.

01:00:20.216 --> 01:00:22.118
WHAT'S BEEN ESTIMATED BY THE

01:00:22.185 --> 01:00:23.453
FEDERAL CIRCUIT TO BE BETWEEN.

01:00:23.519 --> 01:00:25.054
A MILLION AND THREE MILLION

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:26.956
DOLLARS PER PATENT TO PROSECUTE

01:00:27.023 --> 01:00:28.524
IT'S ENORMOUSLY EXPENSIVE

01:00:28.591 --> 01:00:31.427
ENDEAVOR SO WE HEAR ACCUSATIONS

01:00:31.494 --> 01:00:33.629
THAT OUR COMPANIES ARE LAYING

01:00:33.696 --> 01:00:34.897
DOWN AND LETTING THEMSELVES BE

01:00:34.964 --> 01:00:35.765
BRIBED.

01:00:35.832 --> 01:00:37.166
NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM

01:00:37.233 --> 01:00:39.802
THE TRUTH WE GO TO COURT WE

01:00:39.869 --> 01:00:41.704
SPENDING NORMAIS LEGAL FEES BUT

01:00:41.771 --> 01:00:44.007
SOMETIMES AS IN AND ANY OTHER

01:00:44.073 --> 01:00:45.575
TYPE OF LITIGATION THE THE

01:00:45.641 --> 01:00:47.477
BETTER COURSE OF VALOR RATHER

01:00:47.543 --> 01:00:48.111
THAN.

01:00:48.177 --> 01:00:50.046
BOTH -- THE BRAND COMPANIES IN

01:00:50.113 --> 01:00:51.781
THE GENERIC COMPANIES CHURNING

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:53.483
OUT MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF

01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:56.052
DOLLARS OF LEGAL FEES IS TO

01:00:56.119 --> 01:00:57.120
SETTLE.

01:00:57.186 --> 01:00:58.788
THE QUESTION HERE IS.

01:00:58.855 --> 01:01:00.323
DO WE WANT THERE TO BE FAIR

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:02.759
SETTLEMENTS ARE NOT AND IF WE DO

01:01:02.825 --> 01:01:04.394
IF WE WANT SETTLEMENTS THAT WILL

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:06.095
ACTUALLY BRING DRUGS TO MARKET

01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:08.264
BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF PATENTS.

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:10.700
WE CAN'T PUT SUCH A PRESUMPTION

01:01:10.767 --> 01:01:13.336
THAT THE SETTLEMENTS ARE ILLEGAL

01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:14.704
SUCH THAT THESE SETTLEMENTS WILL

01:01:14.771 --> 01:01:17.206
BE CHILLED.

01:01:17.273 --> 01:01:19.842
AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

01:01:19.909 --> 01:01:21.277
UNDER THIS BILL.

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:22.779
THE GOVERNMENT WOULDN'T HAVE TO

01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:23.880
PROVE THAT THERE WAS DELAY

01:01:23.946 --> 01:01:25.481
GENERIC ENTRY THEY WOULD JUST

01:01:25.548 --> 01:01:27.116
HAVE TO PROVE THAT THERE WAS A

01:01:27.183 --> 01:01:27.850
SETTLEMENT.

01:01:27.917 --> 01:01:30.520
AND THAT SOMETHING OF VALUE NO

01:01:30.586 --> 01:01:32.555
MATTER HOW SMALL WENT TO THE

01:01:32.622 --> 01:01:34.223
GENERIC AND THEN ALL THE SUDDEN

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:36.692
YOU'RE FACED WITH ENORMOUS.

01:01:36.759 --> 01:01:41.264
INCLUDING PRIVATE RIGHT OF

01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:41.798
INCENTIVES NOT TO SETTLE.

01:01:41.864 --> 01:01:45.301
SO THAT'S A PRESUMPTION THAT'S

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:47.503
REBUTTABLE.

01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:49.138
THANKS BYE AS SOMEBODY WHO PUTS

01:01:49.205 --> 01:01:49.772
A LOT OF REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION

01:01:49.839 --> 01:01:51.741
Là I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE WITH.

01:01:51.808 --> 01:01:54.077
WITH WHAT'S BEEN DONE HERE I'M

01:01:54.143 --> 01:01:55.278
SICK OF IT YES THE HIGHEST

01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:59.048
POSSIBLE STANDARD OTHER THAN --

01:01:59.115 --> 01:02:01.084
I JUST. ONE COMMENT ONE QUICK

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:01.451
FINAL QUESTION.

01:02:01.517 --> 01:02:03.453
AS IT SEEMS TO ME WITH ALL DUE

01:02:03.519 --> 01:02:05.922
RESPECT TO THE MORE I HEAR AS

01:02:05.988 --> 01:02:08.157
THIS ISSUE WAS PRESENTED.

01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:10.660
FROM ALL SIDES THAT -- THAT

01:02:10.726 --> 01:02:11.794
THERE'S A LOT OF JUST GET YOU

01:02:11.861 --> 01:02:15.164
YOU GUYS ARE ENGAGED IN A GAME.

01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:17.300
I'M LARGELY.

01:02:17.366 --> 01:02:18.868
AS OF A GENERIC WANTING TO SUE

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:20.236
SO THAT THEY CAN BE FIRST IN

01:02:20.303 --> 01:02:21.137
LINE.

01:02:21.204 --> 01:02:24.707
WHEN THE PATENT EXPIRES IN HAVE

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:25.808
EIGHT TIMES BY WHICH THEY'RE THE

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:27.543
FIRST GENERIC CAM I MEAN THERE'S

01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:29.078
A LOT GOING ON HERE?

01:02:29.145 --> 01:02:31.347
THAT IT'S A FINANCIAL MOTIVE AS

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:32.281
WELL TO DO THESE LAWSUITS AND

01:02:32.348 --> 01:02:33.616
THAT'S WHAT THE FEDERAL LAW

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:35.418
CREATED I I UNDERSTAND AND SO

01:02:35.485 --> 01:02:36.786
THE FEDERAL LAW SEEMS VERY

01:02:36.853 --> 01:02:39.021
MESSED UP IN CREATED LIKE A GAME

01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:39.822
THAT'S BEING PLAYED OUT IN

01:02:39.889 --> 01:02:41.057
COURTS AND SETTLEMENTS AND

01:02:41.124 --> 01:02:43.526
THAT'S I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:43.759
TO GET.

01:02:43.826 --> 01:02:45.394
IT THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING.

01:02:45.461 --> 01:02:45.995
TRYING TO BREAK THIS DOWN FOR

01:02:46.062 --> 01:02:48.097
THE FOLKS AT HOME -- THAT'S MY

01:02:48.164 --> 01:02:49.465
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT SEEMS

01:02:49.532 --> 01:02:51.367
LIKE IT'S HAPPENING ON ALL SIDES

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:52.969
IN IN BECAUSE OF FEDERAL LAW IS

01:02:53.035 --> 01:02:54.403
WRITTEN IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:57.273
KIND OF THIS -- THIS BEHAVIOR

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:58.007
THAT.

01:02:58.074 --> 01:02:59.242
GAMES A SYSTEM FOR EVERY BUT

01:02:59.308 --> 01:03:01.110
AGAIN FOR EVERYBODY EXCEPT THE

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:02.044
CONSUMER.

01:03:02.111 --> 01:03:03.613
SO I UNDERSTAND THAT IS MY

01:03:03.679 --> 01:03:04.514
UNDERSTANDING OF THIS LAW AND

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:05.581
THAT'S WHY I'M SUPPORTIVE BUT I

01:03:05.648 --> 01:03:06.849
DO HAVE ONE QUESTION I HEARD A

01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:07.950
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THEIR STILL

01:03:08.017 --> 01:03:09.485
THINGS WERE WORKING ON AND

01:03:09.552 --> 01:03:11.988
POSSIBLY CAN WORK ON I WOULD SAY

01:03:12.054 --> 01:03:13.523
FROM THE PROPONENTS WHAT DO YOU.

01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:14.790
DO YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY THAT

01:03:14.857 --> 01:03:16.792
THERE IS STILL THINGS WE CAN

01:03:16.859 --> 01:03:19.428
WORK ON TO TO HELP MOVE THIS

01:03:19.495 --> 01:03:24.433
BILL AND WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS.

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:25.368
HI DOCTOR WOULD MAYBE YEAH I

01:03:25.434 --> 01:03:26.235
WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST SAY I'M

01:03:26.302 --> 01:03:27.603
ALWAYS OPEN TO WORKING TO

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:29.172
WORKING ON THIS I THINK THAT ONE

01:03:29.238 --> 01:03:30.239
OF THE CHALLENGES IS.

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:32.375
THE PENDULUM HAS BEEN SO FAR IN

01:03:32.441 --> 01:03:34.210
FAVOR OF THE DRUG COMPANIES --

01:03:34.277 --> 01:03:35.878
THROUGH THE FTC PROCESS THAT

01:03:35.945 --> 01:03:37.146
WE'RE TRYING TO SHIFT IT THE

01:03:37.213 --> 01:03:39.015
OTHER WAY SO WE'RE GOING TO FAR

01:03:39.081 --> 01:03:40.950
I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO TO LISTEN

01:03:41.017 --> 01:03:42.952
TO THAT AND AND AND LOOK FOR A

01:03:43.019 --> 01:03:44.153
RESOLUTION THERE.

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:45.721
BUT I THINK IT'S TIME THAT MAYBE

01:03:45.788 --> 01:03:47.523
THE CONSUMER GETS THE UPPER HAND

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:49.692
OR AT LEAST GET A FAIR SHAKE AND

01:03:49.759 --> 01:03:50.293
I THINK WE'VE HAD A FAIR SHAKE

01:03:50.359 --> 01:03:51.360
FOR A LONG LONG TIME.

01:03:51.427 --> 01:03:52.428
SO IF THERE'S AN ISSUE OUT THERE

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:54.030
THAT IS BEING WORKED ON IT

01:03:54.096 --> 01:03:55.398
HASN'T BEEN NIGHT YOU HAVEN'T

01:03:55.464 --> 01:03:57.066
FOUND ONE YET IDENTIFIED THAT

01:03:57.133 --> 01:03:58.734
YOU'RE CONTINUING TO WORK ON

01:03:58.801 --> 01:04:00.803
WILL WE I I HAVEN'T CAN I

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:01.404
HAVEN'T FELT WOULD BE A NEW

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:01.971
ISSUE THAT.

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:03.706
THEY BRING UP FROM THE BILL THAT

01:04:03.773 --> 01:04:05.074
WOULD BE WORKED ON OKAY I JUST

01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:06.442
WANNA BE CLEAR AS THIS MOVES

01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:08.044
BECAUSE EXPECTATIONS.

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:10.246
I'VE LEARNED YES VERY IMPORTANT

01:04:10.313 --> 01:04:11.647
FOR EVERYBODY'S EXPECTATIONS TO

01:04:11.714 --> 01:04:13.482
BE IN THE SAME PLACE MY DOOR IS

01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:14.483
ALWAYS OPEN I WILL CONTINUE TO

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:16.319
WORK WITH THE IF THERE IF THERE

01:04:16.385 --> 01:04:19.555
ARE REASONABLE -- PROBLEMS

01:04:19.622 --> 01:04:20.089
BROUGHT TO US THAT DO NOT

01:04:20.156 --> 01:04:21.591
WEEKEND THE INTENT OF WHAT WE'RE

01:04:21.657 --> 01:04:23.125
TRYING TO DO ABSOLUTELY WE WILL

01:04:23.192 --> 01:04:24.126
CONSIDER THEM [inaudible]

01:04:24.193 --> 01:04:26.429
THANK YOU.

01:04:26.495 --> 01:04:28.231
THANK YOU THIS PETRIE-NORRIS AND

01:04:28.297 --> 01:04:30.199
THEN MR CHAU.

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:31.367
I THINK I'M ONE OF TWO NON

01:04:31.434 --> 01:04:32.835
LAWYERS ON THIS COMMITTEE SO A

01:04:32.902 --> 01:04:34.237
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FROM THAT

01:04:34.303 --> 01:04:35.304
PERSPECTIVE SO.

01:04:35.371 --> 01:04:36.339
IF I UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY THE

01:04:36.405 --> 01:04:38.574
OPPOSITION ASSERTS THAT THIS

01:04:38.641 --> 01:04:41.444
BILL IS IN CONFLICT WITH THE

01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:44.146
SUPREME COURT'S RELIVE RECENT

01:04:44.213 --> 01:04:45.481
TEST.

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:47.650
AND CLEARLY THE THE AUTHOR IN

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:49.118
THE SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL.

01:04:49.185 --> 01:04:50.987
DO NOT BELIEVE THAT.

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:51.487
THAT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:52.855
FUNDAMENTAL.

01:04:52.922 --> 01:04:55.825
I DISCONNECT CAN YOU HELP I

01:04:55.891 --> 01:04:57.860
GUESS CALPERS HELP ME WRAP MY

01:04:57.927 --> 01:05:00.796
MIND AROUND -- I GUESS.

01:05:00.863 --> 01:05:01.931
IN WHY THERE'S THAT THAT

01:05:01.998 --> 01:05:04.567
DISCONNECTED INTERPRETATION AND

01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:06.702
WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED. TO

01:05:06.769 --> 01:05:09.472
RESOLVE THAT.

01:05:09.538 --> 01:05:11.574
CERTAINLY SO -- FILL THERE ISN'T

01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:13.409
THERE ISN'T A CONFLICT BETWEEN

01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:15.111
RULE OF REASON LAW AND WHAT THE

01:05:15.177 --> 01:05:16.312
BILL DOES.

01:05:16.379 --> 01:05:19.181
THE BILL LOOKS AT WHO BEARS WHAT

01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:21.717
BURDENS AS THAT LAW PLAYS OUT

01:05:21.784 --> 01:05:24.153
THE QUESTION IN A RULE OF REASON.

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:26.756
IS IS THERE A PRO COMPETITIVE

01:05:26.822 --> 01:05:28.824
BENEFIT THAT STILL IN THE BILL

01:05:28.891 --> 01:05:31.160
IT'S STILL FOLLOWS BOTH THE

01:05:31.227 --> 01:05:33.229
FEDERAL ANTI TRUST LAW AND

01:05:33.296 --> 01:05:35.364
CALIFORNIA'S STATE ANTITRUST LAW.

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:36.332
THEY'RE THERE TO SYSTEMS FOR

01:05:36.399 --> 01:05:38.601
ANTI TRUST AND THEY ARE ALLOWED

01:05:38.668 --> 01:05:40.503
TO EXIST AND THAT THEY HAD THEY

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:41.804
ARE DIFFERENT IN SOME WAYS

01:05:41.871 --> 01:05:43.339
CALIFORNIA'S IS ACTUALLY OLDER

01:05:43.406 --> 01:05:45.341
THAN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM -- BUT

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:47.043
NONE OF THIS CHANGES THE BASIC

01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:48.311
NOTION THAT WERE ASKING IF YOU

01:05:48.377 --> 01:05:50.846
WANT TO DO THIS IS THERE A PRO

01:05:50.913 --> 01:05:55.584
COMPETITIVE REASON AND ASKING

01:05:55.651 --> 01:05:57.286
THAT THE COMPANY'S PROOF THAT.

01:05:57.353 --> 01:06:00.156
AND HOW DOES THAT DIFFER FROM.

01:06:00.222 --> 01:06:01.390
YOUR INTERPRETATION AND THE

01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:02.858
ACTIVISTS DECISION THE SUPREME

01:06:02.925 --> 01:06:06.462
COURT AND A DECISION THAT WAS --

01:06:06.529 --> 01:06:08.197
AUTHORED BY JUSTICE PRIOR.

01:06:08.264 --> 01:06:09.498
UP REJECTED.

01:06:09.565 --> 01:06:12.401
AN AUTOMATIC PRESUMPTION THAT A

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:14.170
SETTLEMENT BETWEEN A BRAND AND

01:06:14.236 --> 01:06:15.838
GENERIC IS AUTOMATICALLY ANTI

01:06:15.905 --> 01:06:17.807
COMPETITIVE THEY SAID THAT SUCH

01:06:17.873 --> 01:06:19.575
A PRESUMPTION WAS APPROPRIATE

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:21.277
QUOTE ONLY WHERE AN OBSERVER

01:06:21.344 --> 01:06:23.012
WITH EVEN A RUDIMENTARY

01:06:23.079 --> 01:06:24.413
UNDERSTANDING OF ECONOMICS.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:26.082
COULD CONCLUDE THAT THE

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:27.350
ARRANGEMENT QUESTION.

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:29.185
WOULD HAVE AN ANTI COMPETITIVE A

01:06:29.251 --> 01:06:31.420
FACT ON CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:32.555
AND QUOTE.

01:06:32.621 --> 01:06:34.824
AND SO WHAT THE SUPREME COURT

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:39.028
HELD WAS THAT IF THERE IS SUCH A

01:06:39.095 --> 01:06:40.262
SETTLEMENT THAT.

01:06:40.329 --> 01:06:42.298
THERE THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE

01:06:42.365 --> 01:06:43.499
BURDEN TO PROVE THAT IT WAS ANTI

01:06:43.566 --> 01:06:45.301
COMPETITIVE BECAUSE SOME OF

01:06:45.368 --> 01:06:47.403
THESE SETTLEMENTS XCELERATED

01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:50.573
GENERIC ACCESS AND AND AND ONLY

01:06:50.639 --> 01:06:52.074
A SMALL NUMBER DO NOT.

01:06:52.141 --> 01:06:54.910
THIS BILL -- REJECTS WHAT THE

01:06:54.977 --> 01:06:56.979
SUPREME COURT HELD AND INCLUDES

01:06:57.046 --> 01:06:58.714
A PRESUMPTION THAT IS ONLY

01:06:58.781 --> 01:06:59.682
REBUTTABLE BY CLEAR AND

01:06:59.749 --> 01:07:01.650
CONVINCING EVIDENCE WHICH IS A

01:07:01.717 --> 01:07:05.054
VERY HIGH STANDARD -- THAT.

01:07:05.121 --> 01:07:06.522
A WHOLE BOLUS OF SETTLEMENTS

01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:07.056
THAT.

01:07:07.123 --> 01:07:09.325
THE F. T. C. HAS FOUND ARE FINE

01:07:09.392 --> 01:07:10.426
BECAUSE THE F. T. C.

01:07:10.493 --> 01:07:12.928
AUTOMATICALLY GETS THE DETAILS

01:07:12.995 --> 01:07:16.465
OF ALL OF THEM -- IT THAT IT

01:07:16.532 --> 01:07:19.535
JUST -- CREATES A DIFFERENT

01:07:19.602 --> 01:07:20.936
STANDARD.

01:07:21.003 --> 01:07:23.305
AND THE IT'S NOT THAT THE YOU

01:07:23.372 --> 01:07:23.873
KNOW FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

01:07:23.939 --> 01:07:24.874
ALWAYS RIGHT AND STATE THROW IS

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:26.876
WRONG BUT THIS IS A SHARP

01:07:26.942 --> 01:07:28.544
DEPARTURE.

01:07:28.611 --> 01:07:31.280
FROM WHAT THE FTC HAS BEEN DOING

01:07:31.347 --> 01:07:33.649
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WHICH

01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:35.151
HAS RESULTED IN.

01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:38.621
THE AN EXTREME SMALL AMOUNT OF

01:07:38.687 --> 01:07:41.457
OF SETTLEMENTS THAT HAVE VALUE

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:46.362
GOING TO GENERICS. SIX THEN YOU

01:07:46.429 --> 01:07:46.896
WOULD ASSERT THAT JUST THE

01:07:46.962 --> 01:07:48.764
NOTION OF A REBUTTABLE

01:07:48.831 --> 01:07:50.366
PRESUMPTION IN THIS ARENA.

01:07:50.433 --> 01:07:52.234
IS IN CONFLICT WITH THE RESERVE

01:07:52.301 --> 01:07:55.704
REPORT EXPRESSLY REJECTED THAT.

01:07:55.771 --> 01:07:56.372
THIS READ.

01:07:56.439 --> 01:07:57.440
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY FIRST I

01:07:57.506 --> 01:07:58.774
THINK THE BILL IS CONSISTENT

01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:01.076
WITH THE FTC PROCESS -- THE FTC

01:08:01.143 --> 01:08:02.278
ACTION ON THEIR WEBSITE --

01:08:02.344 --> 01:08:04.313
INDICATES THEY WANT LEGISLATION

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:07.283
ON THIS ISSUE -- SECOND -- THE

01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:09.018
CURRENT WE IT THE FTC PROCESS

01:08:09.084 --> 01:08:09.752
ALLOWS FOR PRIVATE RIGHT OF

01:08:09.819 --> 01:08:11.086
ACTION SO THIS IS NOT THERE'S

01:08:11.153 --> 01:08:12.221
NOT INCONSISTENT.

01:08:12.288 --> 01:08:13.122
I THINK THE DRUG MANUFACTURERS

01:08:13.189 --> 01:08:14.690
ACTUALLY WANT YOU TO BELIEVE

01:08:14.757 --> 01:08:16.425
THAT -- THERE IS PREEMPTION ON

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:17.493
THIS ISSUE BY CLAIMING

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:19.028
INCONSISTENCY WITH THE FTC

01:08:19.094 --> 01:08:20.429
PROCESS I THINK YOU'VE HEARD

01:08:20.496 --> 01:08:22.097
THAT HERE TODAY.

01:08:22.164 --> 01:08:22.698
LET ME TELL YOU THERE'S NO PRE

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:24.366
EMPTION HERE -- CALIFORNIA HAS

01:08:24.433 --> 01:08:26.135
LONG AND HAD A HISTORY OF

01:08:26.202 --> 01:08:28.170
ADOPTING A STRONGER ANTI A TRUST

01:08:28.237 --> 01:08:29.138
LIKE LEGISLATION AND WE'RE

01:08:29.205 --> 01:08:30.739
COMPLETE WITHIN OUR RIGHTS TO DO

01:08:30.806 --> 01:08:32.308
SO -- TO HAVE STRICTER RULES

01:08:32.374 --> 01:08:33.876
STRICTER LAWS IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:35.478
WE DO THAT ON A NUMBER ON A

01:08:35.544 --> 01:08:37.680
NUMBER OF ISSUES -- SO I DON'T

01:08:37.746 --> 01:08:38.714
BELIEVE IT'S I DON'T BELIEVE

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:40.082
IT'S ANTICOMPLY ID THAT IS IN

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:41.784
CONFLICT -- WITH THE SUPREME

01:08:41.851 --> 01:08:43.352
COURT IN ANYWAY I THINK IT

01:08:43.419 --> 01:08:46.088
ACTUALLY THEY ACTUALLY GO SIGNED

01:08:46.155 --> 01:08:46.689
THEY GO SIDE BY SIDE.

01:08:46.755 --> 01:08:49.158
WELL AND I'M.

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:50.860
JUST MAYBE TO ANSWER THEM PLUS A

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:51.360
QUESTION THERE.

01:08:51.427 --> 01:08:52.328
WERE FULLY WITHIN OUR RIGHTS AS

01:08:52.394 --> 01:08:54.263
A LEGISLATIVE BODY TO NOT AGREE

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:55.464
WITH THE SUPREME COURT AND SET

01:08:55.531 --> 01:08:57.299
OUR OWN STANDARDS.

01:08:57.366 --> 01:08:58.467
I MIGHT ALSO NOTE THAT THE

01:08:58.534 --> 01:09:00.503
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:02.171
DEALT WITH THE ISSUE OF THESE

PAY FOR DELAY AGREEMENTS.

01:09:03.906 --> 01:09:05.341
AND HAS TAKEN A DIFFERENT

01:09:05.407 --> 01:09:07.810
APPROACH FROM THE US SUPREME

01:09:07.877 --> 01:09:09.445
COURT IT HAS FOUND.

01:09:09.512 --> 01:09:11.380
AGREEMENTS ARE VERY HARMFUL TO

01:09:11.447 --> 01:09:12.748
CONSUMER AND HAS URGED TO

01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:15.084
STANDARD THAT IS MUCH MORE

01:09:15.150 --> 01:09:16.018
STRIPPED.

01:09:16.085 --> 01:09:18.120
AND HAS URGED MORE ROBUST

01:09:18.187 --> 01:09:20.089
ENFORCEMENT RECOGNIZING THE

01:09:20.155 --> 01:09:21.624
FRAILTIES THAT THE ACT OF THIS

01:09:21.690 --> 01:09:25.761
DECISION.

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:28.731
RIGHT THIS IS THAT YOUR QUESTION.

01:09:28.797 --> 01:09:30.666
THANK YOU WITH A CHOP.

01:09:30.733 --> 01:09:32.034
I'M I'M WONDERING WHETHER

01:09:32.101 --> 01:09:32.668
ANYBODY CAN ACTUALLY CAN SHARE

01:09:32.735 --> 01:09:34.737
WITH US EITHER -- AN EXAMPLE OR

01:09:34.803 --> 01:09:37.706
A CASE.

01:09:37.773 --> 01:09:39.341
WITH FACTS THAT WOULD -- SHOW A

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:40.843
STAT THE PRESUMPTION CAN BE

01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:43.712
REBUTTED EITHER IN TERMS OF THE

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:47.349
VALUE BEING FAIR OR HAVING THE

01:09:47.416 --> 01:09:50.419
PRETTY COMPETITIVE BENEFITS --

01:09:50.486 --> 01:09:53.589
OF THE OUT WAIT YOU KNOW.

01:09:53.656 --> 01:09:55.090
ALL WEATHER WISE.

01:09:55.157 --> 01:09:56.792
WELL I KNOW IT'S A I KNOW IT'S

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:57.693
FACTUAL I KNOW IT'S A YOU KNOW

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.128
EVERYTHING'S CASE BY CASE BUT

01:09:59.194 --> 01:10:00.763
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE FACTORS

01:10:00.829 --> 01:10:01.630
THAT ARE BEING CONSIDERED FOR

01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:03.766
EXAMPLE THAT COULD BE USED IN

01:10:03.832 --> 01:10:04.600
THE WEIGHING OF THE A THE

01:10:04.667 --> 01:10:06.802
BALANCING OF THE OF THE TO DO

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:07.703
YOU.

01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:08.804
KNOW THE TWO PROBLEMS WITH THE

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:11.240
THREE PROBLEMS WELL FOR INSTANCE

01:10:11.307 --> 01:10:12.341
LET'S SAY THE GENERIC DRUG

01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:15.044
COMPANY HAS PURCHASED -- AN

01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:18.614
INVENTORY OF ACTIVE INGREDIENT

01:10:18.681 --> 01:10:20.015
FROM THE BRAND COMPANY.

01:10:20.082 --> 01:10:24.453
SO THE BRAND COMPANY MAY BE.

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:25.888
THIS IS SO SO THERE'S PAYMENT

01:10:25.955 --> 01:10:27.356
BUT THE COMPANIES CAN SHOW THAT

01:10:27.423 --> 01:10:29.391
THERE IS VALUE FOR THAT PAYMENT

01:10:29.458 --> 01:10:31.527
REASONABLE VALUE FOR THAT

01:10:31.594 --> 01:10:34.163
PAYMENT -- SO THAT IS NOT PAID

01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:36.265
FOR DELAY IT'S PAY FOR SOME

01:10:36.332 --> 01:10:38.934
ALTERNATIVE PRODUCT OR SERVICES

01:10:39.001 --> 01:10:41.270
AND IT'S A REASONABLE --

01:10:41.337 --> 01:10:43.539
APPROXIMATION OF THE VALUE OF

01:10:43.606 --> 01:10:45.441
THAT PRODUCT OR SERVICES THAT'S

01:10:45.507 --> 01:10:47.610
BEING.

01:10:47.676 --> 01:10:48.744
SHARED BETWEEN THE COMPANIES.

01:10:48.811 --> 01:10:50.412
SO THAT'S THE CASE WERE TO VALUE

01:10:50.479 --> 01:10:52.982
COULD BE DEEMED FAIR.

01:10:53.048 --> 01:10:54.316
IN THAT PARTICULAR CONTEXT IN

01:10:54.383 --> 01:10:55.718
RIGHT AND IT WOULD BE UP TO THE

01:10:55.784 --> 01:10:57.353
DRUG COMPANIES TO ESTABLISH THAT

01:10:57.419 --> 01:10:58.988
THAT WAS WHAT WAS TRULY

01:10:59.054 --> 01:11:00.055
HAPPENING.

01:11:00.122 --> 01:11:02.491
TYPICALLY IN THESE CASES THE

01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:04.360
DRUG COMPANIES DON'T PROVIDE

01:11:04.426 --> 01:11:06.629
DOCUMENTS AS TO WHAT ACTUALLY

01:11:06.695 --> 01:11:08.230
WENT ON IN THESE AGREEMENTS.

01:11:08.297 --> 01:11:10.299
THEY WITHHOLD THE DOCUMENTS AS

01:11:10.366 --> 01:11:14.003
PRIVILEGED SO IT IT CREATES A

01:11:14.069 --> 01:11:16.071
VACUUM OF EVIDENCE WHICH GIVES

01:11:16.138 --> 01:11:18.007
AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE TO TO THE

01:11:18.073 --> 01:11:19.408
DRUG COMPANIES AND THAT'S PART

01:11:19.475 --> 01:11:20.576
OF WHAT THE BILL DOES HERE.

01:11:20.643 --> 01:11:22.745
IS TO ALIGN THAT PRESUMPTION

01:11:22.811 --> 01:11:28.117
WITH THE PERSON WHO POSSESSES

01:11:28.183 --> 01:11:28.751
THE EVIDENCE THAT WILL BE A JURY

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:30.486
QUESTION.

01:11:30.552 --> 01:11:31.520
THAT WOULD BE A JURY QUESTION

01:11:31.587 --> 01:11:32.488
QUICK QUESTION FOR THE JURY TO

01:11:32.554 --> 01:11:34.323
ANSWER IS FACTUAL QUESTION

01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:35.758
ESSENTIAL YES OKAY.

01:11:35.824 --> 01:11:36.058
THANK YOU.

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:36.692
IF I COULD RESPOND I THINK THAT

01:11:36.759 --> 01:11:37.493
THAT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF WHERE

01:11:37.559 --> 01:11:38.293
THERE SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR CARVE

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:38.994
OUT.

01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:41.930
FROM A VERY STRONG PRESUMPTION

01:11:41.997 --> 01:11:45.534
AND I AGREE WITH THE ETERNAL

01:11:45.601 --> 01:11:47.770
GENERAL'S OFFICE THAT -- IN THAT

01:11:47.836 --> 01:11:49.104
CASE WHERE THERE IS A FAIR

01:11:49.171 --> 01:11:51.940
MARKET VALUE EXCHANGE OF GOODS

01:11:52.007 --> 01:11:55.544
OR SERVICES -- THERE SHOULD BE A

01:11:55.611 --> 01:11:57.112
THERE SHE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO

01:11:57.179 --> 01:11:58.247
FACE.

01:11:58.313 --> 01:12:00.783
THE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES THAT

01:12:00.849 --> 01:12:02.418
THAT THIS.

01:12:02.484 --> 01:12:04.153
BILL WOULD PUT INTO A FACT AND

01:12:04.219 --> 01:12:06.255

CLEAR SAFE HARBOR SAID THAT --

01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:16.031
HE IS SO THAT COMPANIES WHO

01:12:16.098 --> 01:12:17.633
DON'T WANT TO TAKE A RISK OF

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:19.535
HAVING TO GO TO COURT AND FACE

01:12:19.601 --> 01:12:20.669
ENORMOUS LIABILITY.

01:12:20.736 --> 01:12:22.037

01:12:22.104 --> 01:12:23.939

GO TO COURT -- THAT THEY ARE

THE COASTAL ZONE IN SAN DIEGO

01:15:40.802 --> 01:15:42.004
COUNTY.

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:43.472
IS REALLY EVERY CITY CAN

01:15:43.538 --> 01:15:45.207
REGULATE SHORT TERM VACATION

01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:46.275
RENTALS WITHIN THEIR OWN PER

01:15:46.341 --> 01:15:47.242
VIEW UNLESS YOU'RE IN THE

01:15:47.309 --> 01:15:48.577
COASTAL ZONE.

01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:49.478
AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE

01:15:49.544 --> 01:15:51.346
COASTAL ZONE IS REALLY FULL TIME

01:15:51.413 --> 01:15:53.048
SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS ARE

01:15:53.115 --> 01:15:54.583
REMOVING HOUSING FROM OUR

01:15:54.650 --> 01:15:55.851
HOUSING STOCK.

01:15:55.918 --> 01:15:57.886
AND THIS IS CAUSING AN INCREASE

01:15:57.953 --> 01:16:00.088
IN LONG TERM RENTAL PRICES AND

01:16:00.155 --> 01:16:02.424
REMOVING LONG TERM RENTALS FROM

01:16:02.491 --> 01:16:03.191
OUR MARKET.

01:16:03.258 --> 01:16:05.294
THAT'S INCREASING GENTRIFICATION

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.762
AND NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAVE

01:16:06.828 --> 01:16:08.897
TYPICALLY HAD YOU KNOW DOCTORS

01:16:08.964 --> 01:16:10.432
LIVING NEXT TO A TEACHER LIVING

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:12.668
NEXT -- TO A SMALL BUSINESS

01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:14.503
OWNER AND THIS IS AN ACUTE

01:16:14.569 --> 01:16:16.204
PROBLEM AN AREA WHERE IT IS

01:16:16.271 --> 01:16:17.940
DIFFICULT TO BUILD HOUSING AND

01:16:18.006 --> 01:16:19.675
THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHER BILLS

01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:21.743
ADDRESSING -- HOW DO YOU DRESS

01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:22.611
THE HOUSING CRISIS?

01:16:22.678 --> 01:16:24.246
SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS WE ARE

01:16:24.313 --> 01:16:25.981
NOT TRYING TO BAN ANY SHORT TERM

01:16:26.048 --> 01:16:27.883
VACATION RENTAL WE'RE SAYING HOW

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:29.418
DO YOU PROPERLY AND

01:16:29.484 --> 01:16:31.086
APPROPRIATELY REGULATE.

01:16:31.153 --> 01:16:32.287
THE ONES THAT ARE REMOVING

01:16:32.354 --> 01:16:33.922
HOUSING FROM THE HOUSING STOCK

01:16:33.989 --> 01:16:35.490
SO YOU STILL PROVIDE ACCESS TO

01:16:35.557 --> 01:16:37.359
THE COAST YOU'RE STILL PROVIDING

01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:38.927
LOW COST ACCOMMODATION BUT

01:16:38.994 --> 01:16:40.862
YOU'RE PREVENTING THIS REMOVAL

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:41.630
THE HOUSING STOCK THAT'S

01:16:41.697 --> 01:16:45.233
MASSIVELY HURTING OUR

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:46.535
COMMUNITIES.

01:16:46.601 --> 01:16:48.837
AND SO -- THE MEMONS ALSO

01:16:48.904 --> 01:16:49.638
CLARIFY THIS BILL MILLER

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:50.772
CIRCUMVENT NOR PRECLUDED CITIES

01:16:50.839 --> 01:16:51.807
EXISTING OR PERSPECTIVE SHORT

01:16:51.873 --> 01:16:53.108
TERM VACATION RENTAL ORDINANCE

01:16:53.175 --> 01:16:54.443
AND I THINK THAT WAS A KEY

01:16:54.509 --> 01:16:55.911
AMENDMENT WE GOT FROM THE CHAIR

01:16:55.978 --> 01:16:56.912
AND STUFF THAT I REALLY

01:16:56.979 --> 01:16:57.612
APPRECIATE.

01:16:57.679 --> 01:16:59.848
THAT THE ALL THE REGULATIONS

01:16:59.915 --> 01:17:00.515
THAT HAVE BEEN ALREADY

01:17:00.582 --> 01:17:01.683
NEGOTIATED WITH THE COASTAL

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:03.518
COMMISSION THAT ARE MORE

01:17:03.585 --> 01:17:05.087
RESTRICTIVE THAN OUR ORNETTE OUR

01:17:05.153 --> 01:17:06.288
OUR SUGGESTION.

01:17:06.355 --> 01:17:07.723
THEY STAY IN PLACE.

01:17:07.789 --> 01:17:09.624
AND ABOVE ALL THIS IS REGULATING

01:17:09.691 --> 01:17:11.593
THE POP FORMS SO WE'RE NOT

01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:13.128
TOUCHING AND A BIT ANYBODY'S

01:17:13.195 --> 01:17:14.629
INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO

01:17:14.696 --> 01:17:16.398
HAVE AN INDEPENDENT WEBSITE TO

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:17.132
LIST THEIR SHORT TERM VACATION

01:17:17.199 --> 01:17:17.966
RENTAL.

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:19.301
RIGHT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET

01:17:19.368 --> 01:17:20.736
IS THE CRUX OF THIS PROBLEM

01:17:20.802 --> 01:17:22.270
WHERE THROUGH AN INDIVIDUAL

01:17:22.337 --> 01:17:24.106
ACTION OF RENTING OUT A SHORT

01:17:24.172 --> 01:17:25.807
TERM VACATION RENTAL FULL TIME

01:17:25.874 --> 01:17:27.409
THAT HAS AN INDIVIDUAL BENEFIT.

01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:29.411
BUT IT DESTROYS THE COMMUNITY IN

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:30.946
ITS ENTIRETY AND THAT'S WHAT

01:17:31.013 --> 01:17:32.781
WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO GET OUT

01:17:32.848 --> 01:17:34.316
WITH -- THIS BILL AND IN THE

01:17:34.383 --> 01:17:35.450
MIDST OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE

01:17:35.517 --> 01:17:37.619
WHEN HOUSING CRISIS THE HOUSING

01:17:37.686 --> 01:17:39.254
SHORTAGES PARTICULAR CUTE IN THE

01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:40.589
COASTAL ZONE CITIES FACE

01:17:40.655 --> 01:17:42.057
COMPOUNDING VARIOUS TO

01:17:42.124 --> 01:17:43.191
REGULATING SHORT TERM VACATION

01:17:43.258 --> 01:17:43.558
RENTALS.

01:17:43.625 --> 01:17:45.327
WHEN SINGING TO MINIMIZE OR

01:17:45.394 --> 01:17:46.962
REGULATE THE NUMBER OF THESE

01:17:47.029 --> 01:17:47.429
RENTALS IN RESIDENTIAL

01:17:47.496 --> 01:17:48.296
NEIGHBORHOODS?

01:17:48.363 --> 01:17:49.898
THERE IS A SPIKE IN SHORT TERM

01:17:49.965 --> 01:17:51.700
VACATION RENTALS -- UNITS

01:17:51.767 --> 01:17:52.801
REDUCES THE AVAILABILITY

01:17:52.868 --> 01:17:54.803
AVAILABILITY OF ALREADY SCARCE

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:55.937
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN MANY

01:17:56.004 --> 01:17:57.072
COASTAL COMMUNITIES.

01:17:57.139 --> 01:17:59.408
AND ANY UNIT RESERVE RESERVE

01:17:59.474 --> 01:18:00.008
REMOVED FROM HIS OWN HOUSING

01:18:00.075 --> 01:18:05.781
STOCK IS DIFFICULT IF NOT

01:18:05.847 --> 01:18:08.216
IMPOSSIBLE. TO REPLACE AND I

01:18:08.283 --> 01:18:09.184
THINK YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:09.985
THE COASTAL ZONE FOR EXAMPLE

01:18:10.052 --> 01:18:10.986
ANTHONY IS THE CITY I'M FROM

01:18:11.053 --> 01:18:13.021
ABOUT THREE FORCE MAYBE EVEN

01:18:13.088 --> 01:18:13.789
MORE THAN THAT IS IN THE COASTAL

01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:14.189
ZONE.

01:18:14.256 --> 01:18:14.990
AND OTHER CITIES LIKE OCEANSIDE%

01:18:15.057 --> 01:18:16.691
IS JUST WEST OF THE ONE A ONE

01:18:16.758 --> 01:18:18.360
THEIR SMALLER AREAS -- AND

01:18:18.427 --> 01:18:19.361
CITIES IN CALIFORNIA NATION ONE

01:18:19.428 --> 01:18:20.762
HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO STRIKE A

01:18:20.829 --> 01:18:21.696
BALANCE TO REGULATE ON MY

01:18:21.763 --> 01:18:23.165
VACATION RENTALS. FOR ALMOST A

01:18:23.231 --> 01:18:25.067
DECADE SHORT TERM PLATFORMS INTO

01:18:25.133 --> 01:18:26.168
AND THEIR OWN TELLING HAVE BEEN

01:18:26.234 --> 01:18:27.702
A RESOURCE FOR MIDDLE CLASS AN

01:18:27.769 --> 01:18:29.004
EXTRA SOURCE OF INCOME FOR

01:18:29.071 --> 01:18:31.406
FAMILIES IN NEED. FOR AN

01:18:31.473 --> 01:18:32.407
ECONOMIC VIEW A BOOST HOWEVER

01:18:32.474 --> 01:18:34.276
THE SHIFT IN THE INDUSTRY THOSE

01:18:34.342 --> 01:18:35.444
PROVIDING DETRIMENTAL SMALL

01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:37.279
RESIDENTIAL COMMITTEES WERE FOR

01:18:37.345 --> 01:18:37.612
DOUBLE RIGHT.

01:18:37.679 --> 01:18:38.814
HOUSING IS ALREADY CHALLENGING

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:39.748
TO FIND.

01:18:39.815 --> 01:18:41.817
SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS --

01:18:41.883 --> 01:18:43.285
BENEFITS PROPERTY OWNERS BUT THE

01:18:43.351 --> 01:18:45.053
COLLECTIVELY CREDIT TRAGEDY OF

THE COMMONS.

01:18:46.254 --> 01:18:48.123
THAT MAKING HOUSING AND HIGHLAND

01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:49.357
VALLEY AREAS EVEN MORE

01:18:49.424 --> 01:18:51.293
AFFORDABLE AND THIS IS SOMETHING

01:18:51.359 --> 01:18:53.695
WE CAN'T TO EVERYBODY HOSTAGE DO

01:18:53.762 --> 01:18:55.363
THEIR FAIR SHARE IN ADDRESSING

01:18:55.430 --> 01:19:00.836
OUR HOUSING CRISIS AND THIS IS

01:19:00.902 --> 01:19:01.470
ONE OF ONE OF THE THINGS WE NEED

01:19:01.536 --> 01:19:02.537
TO DO.

01:19:02.604 --> 01:19:07.976
AND THE DECADES TWO MORE THAN

01:19:08.043 --> 01:19:08.743
ELEVEN THOUSAND THE MAJORITY OF

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:20.021
CHALLENGES.

01:19:20.088 --> 01:19:21.890
AND IT HURTS RENTERS.

01:19:21.957 --> 01:19:23.291
THE UCLA ANDERSON SCHOOL

01:19:23.358 --> 01:19:24.826

AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION.

01:19:37.339 --> 01:19:39.407
THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM WHEN THEY

WITHOUT PUBLIC APPROVALS THEN

01:19:49.518 --> 01:19:52.921

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:45.734
HERE.

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:47.235
WHEN MOST PEOPLE THINK OF AIRBNB

01:21:47.302 --> 01:21:49.170
IN SHORT TERM RENTALS THEY THINK

01:21:49.237 --> 01:21:51.072
OF HOME SHARING -- THAT THE

NOT TO US NOT TO THE AUTHOR.

01:22:00.448 --> 01:22:01.683
THE PROBLEM HERE IS WITH THE NEW

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:03.251
YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL CALLED

UNITS WERE OWNED BY THESE

01:22:12.661 --> 01:22:14.329
COMMERCIAL USERS HE FOUND FOR

01:22:14.396 --> 01:22:16.398
EXAMPLE TWELVE COMMERCIAL USERS

ACCOUNTED FOR TWENTY FOUR

01:22:20.468 --> 01:22:21.069
MILLION DOLLARS IN RENT ONE YEAR.

01:22:21.136 --> 01:22:23.104
THE AG FOUND THE COMMERCIAL USER

REPRESENTED 6% OF AIRBNB HOSTS

01:22:27.442 --> 01:22:28.743
BUT ALMOST 40% OF THE REVENUE.

01:22:28.810 --> 01:22:30.312
THESE THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS AND

01:22:30.378 --> 01:22:32.013
COMPANIES A BY UP APARTMENT

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.281
BUILDINGS AND TURN THEM INTO

01:22:33.348 --> 01:22:35.784
ILLEGAL HOTELS.

01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:37.352
HE'S PERSONAL HOSE USERS PRESENT

01:22:37.419 --> 01:22:38.987
A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS ALL OF

01:22:39.054 --> 01:22:40.722
WHICH THIS BILL IS AIMED AT

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:41.523
DEALING WITH.

01:22:41.589 --> 01:22:43.325
THIS CLEARLY HAVING A NEGATIVE

01:22:43.391 --> 01:22:44.526
IMPACT ON HOUSING.

01:22:44.592 --> 01:22:46.528
APARTMENTS AND HOMES ARE BEING

01:22:46.594 --> 01:22:48.063
TAKEN OFF THE LONG TERM RENTAL

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:50.432
MARKET. EIGHT A UNITE HERE

01:22:50.498 --> 01:22:52.067
OFFICIAL TOLD ME THAT HOTEL

01:22:52.133 --> 01:22:53.668
EMPLOYEES ALL OVER THE STATE ARE

01:22:53.735 --> 01:22:54.903
FINDING THEY HAVE TO MOVE

01:22:54.969 --> 01:22:56.104
FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM

01:22:56.171 --> 01:22:57.972
THEIR JOBS BECAUSE FORMALLY

01:22:58.039 --> 01:23:00.108
AFFORDABLE HOMES AND APARTMENTS

01:23:00.175 --> 01:23:01.643
WHEN A LONGER AVAILABLE.

01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:04.079
SO THE BILL LIMITS NOT BANDS FOR

01:23:04.145 --> 01:23:06.014
TERMINALS BY COMMERCIAL USERS IN

01:23:06.081 --> 01:23:07.549
ONE COUNTY IN THE COASTAL ZONE

01:23:07.615 --> 01:23:09.017
FOR A FEW YEARS.

01:23:09.084 --> 01:23:10.385
AND IT SHOULD BE ADDED THAT THE

01:23:10.452 --> 01:23:11.386
AUTHOR HAS WRITTEN THE BILL SO

01:23:11.453 --> 01:23:14.222
IT HAS NO IMPACT ON THOSE WHO

01:23:14.289 --> 01:23:15.657
JUST SHARE THEIR OWN HOMES.

01:23:15.724 --> 01:23:18.293
THEN THERE'S TAXES. ONE OF THE

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:19.594
FEW REVENUE STREAMS THAT LOCAL

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:21.529
GOVERNMENTS HAVE WITHOUT LIMITS

01:23:21.596 --> 01:23:23.298
IS THE T. T. O. T. TRANSIT

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:25.133
OCCUPANCY TAX OUR HOTELS AND BED

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:26.634
AND BREAKFAST PAY THE DOT.

01:23:26.701 --> 01:23:28.336
WHICH IN PLACES.

01:23:28.403 --> 01:23:30.038
LIKE THE GERMANS -- THAT THE

01:23:30.105 --> 01:23:32.574
CHAIRS DISTRICT ARE AS HIGH AS

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:34.442
10% OR ABOVE 10%.

01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:36.077
SHORT TERM RENTALS SHOULD PAY

01:23:36.144 --> 01:23:38.346
THAT TAX AS WELL.

01:23:38.413 --> 01:23:40.181
BUT IN MOST CASES THEY DON'T PAY.

01:23:40.248 --> 01:23:42.283
THAT PUTS LEGITIMATE HOTELS IN

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:43.084
BED AND BREAKFAST AT A

01:23:43.151 --> 01:23:44.686
SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE

01:23:44.753 --> 01:23:46.488
DISADVANTAGE ALL THINGS BEING

01:23:46.554 --> 01:23:49.090
EQUAL IT COSTS 10% MORE TO STAY

01:23:49.157 --> 01:23:51.025
AT A HOTEL OR BED AND BREAKFAST.

01:23:51.092 --> 01:23:52.093
BUT IT ALSO DENIES CITIES AND

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:53.962
COUNTIES.

01:23:54.028 --> 01:23:55.663
OF A LOT OF NEEDED REVENUE WHICH

01:23:55.730 --> 01:23:57.565
IS WHY THIS BILL MANDATES THE

01:23:57.632 --> 01:23:59.434
PLATFORMS COLLECT THAT TOT THAT

01:23:59.501 --> 01:23:59.868
SOLD.

01:23:59.934 --> 01:24:01.102
NOW THE OPPONENTS HAVE A NUMBER

01:24:01.169 --> 01:24:02.570
OF ARGUMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS

01:24:02.637 --> 01:24:05.106
AGAINST THIS. FOR THE ALICE'S IT

01:24:05.173 --> 01:24:06.441
APPEARS THAT SOMEBODY IS ARGUING

01:24:06.508 --> 01:24:08.009
THAT IN SOME CASES A SHORT

01:24:08.076 --> 01:24:08.910
TERMINALS DON'T HAVE TO BE THE

01:24:08.977 --> 01:24:10.445
DOT.

01:24:10.512 --> 01:24:12.580
THAT ONE SURPRISE ME GENERALLY

01:24:12.647 --> 01:24:14.048
THEY DON'T ARGUE THAT PUBLIC --

01:24:14.115 --> 01:24:16.184
OTHERS ARE ARGUING THAT ASKING

01:24:16.251 --> 01:24:17.285
FOR THE PLATFORMS TO COLLECT

01:24:17.352 --> 01:24:19.954
LEGALLY -- TAXES FROM THEIR HOST

01:24:20.021 --> 01:24:21.623
IS A TAX INCREASE.

01:24:21.689 --> 01:24:23.558
AN ARGUMENT THAT THE COMMITTEE

01:24:23.625 --> 01:24:24.993
ANALYSIS RIGHTLY DISMISSED.

01:24:25.059 --> 01:24:26.294
THE ANALYSIS ALSO POINTS OUT

01:24:26.361 --> 01:24:27.796
THAT AIRBNB HAS NUMEROUS

01:24:27.862 --> 01:24:29.931
CONTRACTS WITH CITIES ALL OVER

01:24:29.998 --> 01:24:31.199
THE STATE IN WHICH THEY COLLECT

01:24:31.266 --> 01:24:32.600
YOUR TO FOR THE HOST.

01:24:32.667 --> 01:24:35.703
BUT HERE'S HOW THE DEAL WORKS

01:24:35.770 --> 01:24:36.938
AIRBNB WILL NEVER TELL THE THE

01:24:37.005 --> 01:24:38.173
RENTAL UNITS ARE I DO NEED YOU

01:24:38.239 --> 01:24:39.574
TO WRAP UP PLEASE.

01:24:39.641 --> 01:24:41.042
AIR TO AIRBNB WILL WILL NEVER

01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:43.278
TELL THE CITY OR COUNTY WHERE

01:24:43.344 --> 01:24:44.512
THE UNITS ARE LOCATED.

01:24:44.579 --> 01:24:46.881
THERE THE AIRBNB WILL SIMPLY

01:24:46.948 --> 01:24:48.283
WILL SIMPLY JUST SAY THIS IS%

01:24:48.349 --> 01:24:50.084
WHAT WE WE THINK.

01:24:50.151 --> 01:24:52.086
THAT THE THE T. O. T. FOR FOR

01:24:52.153 --> 01:24:54.355
THAT AREA IS IF YOU DON'T AGREE

01:24:54.422 --> 01:24:55.490
THAT YOU DON'T GET TO COLLECT

01:24:55.557 --> 01:24:56.424
THE DOT.

01:24:56.491 --> 01:24:57.492
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE MOST

01:24:57.559 --> 01:24:58.526
SHORT TERM RENTALS DON'T PAY

01:24:58.593 --> 01:24:59.928
THEIR DOT AND THE MERE

01:24:59.994 --> 01:25:01.196
SUGGESTION THIS BILL THAT THE

01:25:01.262 --> 01:25:02.564
PLATFORM TO MAKE SURE THE MONEY

01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:04.933
IS PAID IS MET WITH I THINK.

01:25:04.999 --> 01:25:06.935
THE TOP ARGUMENTS.

01:25:07.001 --> 01:25:08.970
THANK YOU SIR.

01:25:09.037 --> 01:25:10.672
NEXT WITNESS PLEASE MISTER

IS AN ECLECTIC COALITION.

OF HOTELS AND HOTEL WORKERS

01:25:19.247 --> 01:25:21.783
UNIONS.

01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:23.384
APARTMENT ASSOCIATION OWNERS

01:25:23.451 --> 01:25:24.853
APARTMENT OWNERS AND TENANT

BOTH THE EAST AND THE WEST SIDE.

OF TOWN AND THESE ORGANIZATIONS

01:25:31.626 --> 01:25:33.161
RARELY FIND AGREEMENT ON MUCH OF

01:25:33.228 --> 01:25:35.296
ANYTHING BUT ON ISSUES RELATED

01:25:35.363 --> 01:25:36.164
TO AIRBNB [inaudible]

01:25:36.231 --> 01:25:38.032
THEY DO.

01:25:38.099 --> 01:25:40.602
THEY SING FROM THE SAME HYMNAL.

01:25:40.668 --> 01:25:42.003
THE ISSUES ARE THE SAME FOR ALL

01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:44.272
THESE ORGANIZATIONS AIRBNB IS

01:25:44.339 --> 01:25:45.874
DRAMATICALLY REDUCING.

01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:47.375
HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES IN THE

01:25:47.442 --> 01:25:48.042
CITY.

01:25:48.109 --> 01:25:49.611
AND REDUCING THE AFFORDABILITY

01:25:49.677 --> 01:25:51.846
OF HOUSING IN THE CITY.

01:25:51.913 --> 01:25:53.047
IF I CAME BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE

01:25:53.114 --> 01:25:54.549
MISTER CHAIRMAN.

01:25:54.616 --> 01:25:57.118
WITH A PROPOSAL TO DEMOLISH

01:25:57.185 --> 01:25:57.719
ELEVEN THOUSAND UNITS IN THE

01:25:57.785 --> 01:25:59.954
CITY OF SAN DIEGO ALONE.

01:26:00.021 --> 01:26:02.757
AND NOT REPLACE THE YOU WOULD

01:26:02.824 --> 01:26:05.827
THINK I WAS A LITTLE NUTS.

01:26:05.894 --> 01:26:07.328
BUT THAT'S EFFECTIVELY WHAT'S

01:26:07.395 --> 01:26:09.564
HAPPENED IN SAN DIEGO. ELEVEN

01:26:09.631 --> 01:26:10.498
THOUSAND YEARS ALMOST ALL OF

01:26:10.565 --> 01:26:11.599
THEM IN THE COASTAL ZONE IN

01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:12.667
ALMOST ALL OF THEM RENTED FULL

01:26:12.734 --> 01:26:14.035
TIME.

01:26:14.102 --> 01:26:15.837
ON AIRBNB IN THE OTHER SHORT

01:26:15.904 --> 01:26:17.639
TERM RENTAL PLATFORMS.

01:26:17.705 --> 01:26:19.040
AT A TIME WHEN WE'RE SUFFERING

01:26:19.107 --> 01:26:21.576
THE WORST HOUSING.

01:26:21.643 --> 01:26:23.511
AFFORDABILITY CRISIS IS.

01:26:23.578 --> 01:26:24.145
CERTAINLY IN THE STATE'S HISTORY

01:26:24.212 --> 01:26:28.049
I THINK.

01:26:28.116 --> 01:26:28.950
THE SECOND SET OF ISSUES I WANT

01:26:29.017 --> 01:26:29.984
TALK ABOUT OF THE ECONOMIC

01:26:30.051 --> 01:26:32.253
BENEFITS THEY'RE BEING BE CLAIMS

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:32.787
A CHORE TERMINALS BRING TO

01:26:32.854 --> 01:26:34.055
CITIES.

01:26:34.122 --> 01:26:35.823
IN SAN FRANCISCO OUR CITY'S

01:26:35.890 --> 01:26:36.457
CHIEF ECONOMIST LOOKED AT THE

01:26:36.524 --> 01:26:37.392
ISSUE.

01:26:37.458 --> 01:26:38.860
AND DETERMINE THAT FOR EVERY

01:26:38.927 --> 01:26:40.194
UNIT CONVERTED TO A FULL TIME

01:26:40.261 --> 01:26:42.997
SHORT TERM RENTAL THE CITY LOST.

01:26:43.064 --> 01:26:46.367
LOST. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE

01:26:46.434 --> 01:26:47.435
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN

01:26:47.502 --> 01:26:49.037
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY.

01:26:49.103 --> 01:26:50.572
NEIGHBORHOOD SERVING MERCHANTS

01:26:50.638 --> 01:26:51.839
DON'T SEE THE BENEFIT.

01:26:51.906 --> 01:26:53.808
OF TOURISTS IN RESIDENTIAL

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:54.642
NEIGHBORHOODS.

01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:55.510
THEY MIGHT.

01:26:55.577 --> 01:26:57.045
EAT AT A RESTAURANT THEY MIGHT

01:26:57.111 --> 01:26:58.379
PICK UP A COCKTAIL IT UP IN A

01:26:58.446 --> 01:27:00.048
NEIGHBORHOOD BAR.

01:27:00.114 --> 01:27:01.049
BUT THERE'S NO USE THE DRY

01:27:01.115 --> 01:27:04.485
CLEANER THAN I USED TO COPY SHOP.

01:27:04.552 --> 01:27:06.087
THEY DON'T USE.

01:27:06.154 --> 01:27:09.490
GET A HAIR CUT.

01:27:09.557 --> 01:27:11.125
IS THAT IT IT IS HOLDING IT IT

01:27:11.192 --> 01:27:13.027
HURTS A NEIGHBORHOODS ECONOMY IT

01:27:13.094 --> 01:27:13.561
HURTS NEIGHBORHOOD SERVING

01:27:13.628 --> 01:27:14.062
MERCHANTS.

01:27:14.128 --> 01:27:15.263
AND THE LACK OF HOUSING MAKES IT

01:27:15.330 --> 01:27:17.198
MORE DIFFICULT FOR THOSE

01:27:17.265 --> 01:27:19.601
MERCHANTS TO FIND EMPLOYEES.

01:27:19.667 --> 01:27:21.169
THE ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE

01:27:21.235 --> 01:27:22.403
RECENTLY ISSUED A REPORT ON

01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:23.671
SHORT TERM RENTALS AND WHY THEY

01:27:23.738 --> 01:27:25.773
SHOULD BE REGULATED.

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:28.610
AND THEY SAID THAT 224% OF THE

01:27:28.676 --> 01:27:30.778
MONEY AIRBNB CLAIMS TO BE

01:27:30.845 --> 01:27:32.547

01:27:32.614 --> 01:27:33.815
COMING INTO CITIES.

01:27:33.881 --> 01:27:36.484
IS NEW MONEY IS FOUND MONEY.

01:27:36.551 --> 01:27:37.385
THE REST OF MONEY THAT WOULD

01:27:37.452 --> 01:27:38.920
ALREADY HAVE BEEN SPENT.

01:27:38.987 --> 01:27:40.154
BY PEOPLE COMING AND STAYING IN

LEGITIMATE HOTELS.

01:27:42.323 --> 01:27:43.591
I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE TRANSIT

01:27:43.658 --> 01:27:45.193
OCCUPANCY TAX REVENUES THAT THEY

SAID THEY HAD GENERATED TWELVE

01:27:53.901 --> 01:27:55.303

01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:56.838
IN T. O. T. REVENUE.

SAN FRANCISCO HOTELS GENERATE

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.208

01:28:04.345 --> 01:28:06.547
DROP IN THE BUCKET.

01:28:06.614 --> 01:28:07.548
SO THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS ARE

01:28:07.615 --> 01:28:10.018
INFLATED.

01:28:10.084 --> 01:28:11.219
THE IMPACT ON HOUSING

WITH THIS PROPOSITION BECAUSE OF

01:29:41.976 --> 01:29:44.412

LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:47.682

INITIALLY ESTABLISHED UNDER THE

01:29:56.624 --> 01:29:58.693
NAME OF TENT CITY BECAUSE IT

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:00.194
THRIVED UNDER SHORT TERM.

VACATION RENTALS AT THE TIME

WHICH WERE MERELY TENTS WHICH

REPLACED ON THE BEACH THAT IS

01:30:05.333 --> 01:30:06.801
INEFFECTIVE.

01:30:06.868 --> 01:30:07.869
A SHORT TERM RENTAL IT'S THE

01:30:07.935 --> 01:30:10.104
SAME AS A HOTEL -- THE COASTAL

01:30:10.171 --> 01:30:11.939
COMMISSION HAD INITIALLY ARGUED

01:30:12.006 --> 01:30:14.208
WITH THE INITIAL PROPOSAL THAT

01:30:14.275 --> 01:30:15.843
BY HAVING A SWEEPING BAN OF

01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:16.978
SHORT TERM RENTALS THAT WOULD

01:30:17.044 --> 01:30:19.514
LIMIT PUBLIC ACCESS.

01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:21.282
TO THE BEACH COMMUNITY -- MY

01:30:21.349 --> 01:30:24.318
PROPERTY THAT I PURCHASED --

01:30:24.385 --> 01:30:25.787
WITHOUT GOING INTO SPECIFICS I

01:30:25.853 --> 01:30:28.356
DOES NOT QUALIFY AS A COST

01:30:28.422 --> 01:30:29.891
EFFECTIVE HOUSING TO SAY THE

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:31.125
LEAST.

01:30:31.192 --> 01:30:32.560
I'M WE BOUGHT IT WITH THE

01:30:32.627 --> 01:30:34.061
UNDERSTANDING AT THE TIME THAT

01:30:34.128 --> 01:30:36.164
IT WAS A SHORT TERM RENTAL WE

01:30:36.230 --> 01:30:37.098
STILL USED AS A SHORT TERM

01:30:37.165 --> 01:30:39.333
RENTAL WE HAVE BY USING IT AS A

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:44.105
SHORT TERM RENTAL WE HAVE A

01:30:44.172 --> 01:30:45.640
ROTATING -- EMPLOYEES OF SIX TO

01:30:45.706 --> 01:30:46.174

CLEANERS -- HOUSE CLEANERS--

01:30:51.012 --> 01:30:51.913
THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WE

01:30:51.979 --> 01:30:53.681
EMPLOYEE EVERY SINGLE WEEK TO

01:30:53.748 --> 01:30:54.715
TURN OVER THE PROPERTY TO

01:30:54.782 --> 01:30:55.950
ANOTHER RENTER.

01:30:56.017 --> 01:30:57.919
WE HAVE RENTERS THAT ARE ABLE TO

01:30:57.985 --> 01:30:59.554
STAY ON THE BEACH TWENTY STEPS

01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:00.955
FROM THE SAND THAT OTHERWISE

01:31:01.022 --> 01:31:02.757
WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD A

01:31:02.824 --> 01:31:04.225
PLACE TO STAY ALONG THE BEACH.

01:31:04.292 --> 01:31:06.260
THERE ARE ONLY FOUR HOTELS IN

01:31:06.327 --> 01:31:07.762
THE MISSION BEACH AREA WHERE

01:31:07.829 --> 01:31:09.497
ELSE ARE THE RENTERS OR PEOPLE

01:31:09.564 --> 01:31:11.032
THAT WANT TO COME VACATION

01:31:11.098 --> 01:31:12.133
SUPPOSED TO STAY.

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:14.802
CALM THE IDEA THAT THEN THERE

01:31:14.869 --> 01:31:19.473
CAN BE -- THE I'D THE IDEA THAT

01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:20.775
THAT BY.

01:31:20.842 --> 01:31:23.077
HAVING THIS BROAD SWEEPING BAN

01:31:23.144 --> 01:31:24.579
WOULD SOMEHOW BENEFIT THE

01:31:24.645 --> 01:31:26.914
COMMUNITY DOES NOT APPLY TO

01:31:26.981 --> 01:31:28.082
CERTAIN COMMUNITIES IN SAN DIEGO

01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:30.518
WHICH HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AS

01:31:30.585 --> 01:31:32.353
LONG TERM SHORT TERM RENTALS --

01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:34.956
THERE IS NO ONE THAT WOULD BE

01:31:35.022 --> 01:31:37.225
ABLE TO AFFORD TO RENT ON A

01:31:37.291 --> 01:31:39.026
MONTHLY BASIS THE PROPERTY THAT

01:31:39.093 --> 01:31:39.660
WE YOUNG.

01:31:39.727 --> 01:31:41.229
THE ONLY WAY WE CAN EVEN AFFORD

01:31:41.295 --> 01:31:42.530
THE MORTGAGE AND THEREFORE

01:31:42.597 --> 01:31:44.065
EMPLOY THE SIX OTHER BUSINESSES

01:31:44.131 --> 01:31:46.000
IS BECAUSE WE ARE DOING IT AS A

01:31:46.067 --> 01:31:48.669
SHORT TERM RENTAL -- I BELIEVE

01:31:48.736 --> 01:31:51.405
THAT THE IF THERE IS GOING TO BE

01:31:51.472 --> 01:31:52.607
A BAN IN PLACE THERE ARE CERTAIN

01:31:52.673 --> 01:31:54.375
AREAS IN SAN DIEGO LIKE IN ANY

01:31:54.442 --> 01:31:56.477
OTHER IN ANY OTHER CITY WHERE IT

01:31:56.544 --> 01:31:57.211
WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE TO

01:31:57.278 --> 01:31:58.312
CARVE IT OUT WHERE IT'S A

01:31:58.379 --> 01:31:59.347
COMMUNITY BASED WHERE THERE'S A

01:31:59.413 --> 01:32:00.348
SCHOOL.

01:32:00.414 --> 01:32:02.250
THERE IS NOT EVEN A ELEMENTARY

01:32:02.316 --> 01:32:03.718
SCHOOL IN MISSION BEACH RIGHT

01:32:03.784 --> 01:32:04.986
NOW THEY HAVE TORN THAT DOWN IN

01:32:05.052 --> 01:32:07.321
A BUILDING CONDOS BECAUSE IT IS

01:32:07.388 --> 01:32:09.156
JUST KNOWN AS A VACATION.

01:32:09.223 --> 01:32:11.492
YOU GO TO VACATION THERE -- I

01:32:11.559 --> 01:32:13.060
WOULD REQUEST IF THIS IS

01:32:13.127 --> 01:32:14.996
SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE

01:32:15.062 --> 01:32:16.631
CONSIDERED THAT THERE SHOULD BE --

01:32:16.697 --> 01:32:18.933
TIME TAKEN TO CONSIDER CARVING

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.568
OUT CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS IF

01:32:20.635 --> 01:32:21.669
ANYONE HEARS MY WAS SEEN IT GO

01:32:21.736 --> 01:32:23.304
MISSION BEACH IS.

01:32:23.371 --> 01:32:24.772
KNOWN AS A BEACH TOWN AS A

01:32:24.839 --> 01:32:26.974
VACATION TOWN THERE ARE MORE --

01:32:27.041 --> 01:32:27.975
AREAS FURTHER ALONG THE COAST

01:32:28.042 --> 01:32:29.510
SUCH AS THE PLAN WHICH EVEN

01:32:29.577 --> 01:32:30.912
THOUGH IS ALSO A BEACH TOWN.

01:32:30.978 --> 01:32:32.413
IS MORE OF A COMMUNITY BASED

01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:34.415
TOWN BECAUSE OF THE VALUE OF THE

01:32:34.482 --> 01:32:36.183
HOMES AND ALSO THE QUALITY OF

01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:37.585
EDUCATION'S YOU HAVE THERE.

01:32:37.652 --> 01:32:39.053

BEACH OR SOME OF THESE OTHER

01:32:40.621 --> 01:32:41.789
AREAS COULD BE CARVED OUT OF

01:32:41.856 --> 01:32:46.460
THIS IS AN EXCEPTION I THINK

01:32:46.527 --> 01:32:48.629
THAT THAT WOULD BE WORTH. THREE

01:32:48.696 --> 01:32:49.764
THANK YOU THANK YOU.

01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:50.665

01:32:52.133 --> 01:32:52.900
BEHALF OF AIRBNB I'M GONNA TALK

01:32:52.967 --> 01:32:54.435
BRIEFLY ABOUT ACCESS THE

01:32:54.502 --> 01:32:56.237
AFFORDABLE AFFORDABILITY IN

01:32:56.304 --> 01:32:57.738
HOUSING ISSUES WERE RAISED.

01:32:57.805 --> 01:32:59.440
TIED COLLECTION AND IF THERE'S

01:32:59.507 --> 01:33:02.076
TIME AT THE END SOME SIGNIFICANT

01:33:02.143 --> 01:33:03.544
WORKABILITY ISSUES WITH THE BILL.

01:33:03.611 --> 01:33:06.948
UP FIRST ON ACCESS -- THIS BILL

01:33:07.014 --> 01:33:08.316
WE'RE CONCERNED MAKES IT HARDER

01:33:08.382 --> 01:33:10.184
FOR PEOPLE NOT FORTUNE UP TO

01:33:10.251 --> 01:33:10.818
LIVE AT THE BEACH TO VISIT THE

01:33:10.885 --> 01:33:11.686
BEACH.

01:33:11.752 --> 01:33:13.154
THE COASTAL ACT REQUIRES THE

01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:15.423
COMMISSION TO ASSURE ACCESS THE

01:33:15.489 --> 01:33:16.691
COMMISSION IS DETERMINED THAT

01:33:16.757 --> 01:33:17.491
THE COST OF OVERNIGHT

01:33:17.558 --> 01:33:19.427
ACCOMMODATIONS AS A BARRIER TO

01:33:19.493 --> 01:33:21.262
ACCESS AND FOR THAT REASON --

01:33:21.329 --> 01:33:22.596
THE COMMISSION HAS REJECTED

01:33:22.663 --> 01:33:25.633
LOCAL PROPOSALS TO LIMIT --

01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:27.201
SHORT TERM RENTALS IN COASTAL

01:33:27.268 --> 01:33:29.837
AREAS -- THAT HAD PERMISSIONS

01:33:29.904 --> 01:33:31.539
FAR MORE LIBERAL THAN WHAT IS

01:33:31.605 --> 01:33:34.108
PROPOSED BY THIS BILL -- THIS IS

01:33:34.175 --> 01:33:35.843
BECAUSE THE GAS.

SHORT TERM RENTALS AS THE WAY TO

01:33:40.548 --> 01:33:42.016
VISIT THE BEACH THE AVERAGE AT

01:33:42.083 --> 01:33:43.050

COASTAL RENTAL IS NINETY THREE

01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:46.587
THIRTY AT NIGHT.

01:33:46.654 --> 01:33:47.822
THAT'S THIRTY DOLLARS LOWER THAN

01:33:47.888 --> 01:33:49.256
THE AVERAGE -- COSTS FOR

01:33:49.323 --> 01:33:50.758
ACCOMMODATIONS RIGHT ALONG THE

THE LOOKED AT THE EXPERIENCE AND

01:34:14.715 --> 01:34:16.717
SAN FRANCISCO TO KEEP TAKE AWAY

01:34:16.784 --> 01:34:19.086
FROM THAT FIRST -- STRICT

01:34:19.153 --> 01:34:21.188
RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY OF A

01:34:21.255 --> 01:34:22.289
HOMEOWNER OR RENTER TO RENT

01:34:22.356 --> 01:34:23.824
THEIR UNIT.

01:34:23.891 --> 01:34:25.426
IS GOING TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR

01:34:25.493 --> 01:34:27.094
THAT PERSON TO PERSON TO AFFORD

01:34:27.161 --> 01:34:27.728
TO LIVE.

01:34:27.795 --> 01:34:29.363
I IT TAKES INCOME OUT OF THEIR

01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:30.965
POCKET THAT OTHERWISE COULD HELP

01:34:31.032 --> 01:34:32.166
THEM PAY RENT AND MEET OTHER

01:34:32.233 --> 01:34:34.802
EXPENSES -- THE ABILITY TO RENT

01:34:34.869 --> 01:34:36.604
A ROOM OR A HOUSE. FOR A WEEK

01:34:36.670 --> 01:34:38.139
AND IS USED BY HOST -- IN

01:34:38.205 --> 01:34:40.374
EXPENSIVE AREAS AT ROUGHLY RATE

01:34:40.441 --> 01:34:43.511
OF 32% -- STUDIES SHOW HI DOBSON

01:34:43.577 --> 01:34:45.112
RENT OR MORTGAGE OR OTHER OTHER

01:34:45.179 --> 01:34:46.180

01:34:46.247 --> 01:34:47.748
IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT ON THE

01:34:47.815 --> 01:34:51.752
AVAILABILITY OF HOUSING -- WE

01:34:51.819 --> 01:34:52.620
THINK THE CONCERN IS GROSSLY

01:34:52.686 --> 01:34:54.555
OVERSTATED. TWO REASONS FIRST

01:34:54.622 --> 01:34:57.258
JUST THE SIMPLE ABOUT ECONOMICS --

01:34:57.324 --> 01:34:58.959
IF YOU ARE BUYING A PROPERTY TO

01:34:59.026 --> 01:35:01.195
INVEST YOUR TRYING TO MAXIMIZE

01:35:01.262 --> 01:35:02.630
INVESTMENT RETURN.

01:35:02.696 --> 01:35:04.298
THE BEST WAY TO MAXIMIZE YOUR

01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:05.699
RETURN TO LEASE IT FOR A YEAR.

01:35:05.766 --> 01:35:06.667
THE BAY AREA COUNCIL STUDY

01:35:06.734 --> 01:35:07.968
SHOWED THAT FOR A SHORT TERM

01:35:08.035 --> 01:35:09.703
RENTAL TO EQUAL WHAT YOU WOULD

01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:11.172
GET ANY YEAR FOR EXAMPLE IN

01:35:11.238 --> 01:35:12.406
BERNAL HEIGHTS WITHOUT THE

01:35:12.473 --> 01:35:13.741
RENDON THREE OR NINETEEN NIGHTS.

01:35:13.808 --> 01:35:16.143
AT AVERAGE RATES TO BE RENTED --

01:35:16.210 --> 01:35:18.179
IN THE MARINA AND COVER WHAT YOU

01:35:18.245 --> 01:35:20.114
GET FROM YOUR LEASE WOULD BE YOU

01:35:20.181 --> 01:35:20.648
WOULD HAVE TO BE HONORING

01:35:20.714 --> 01:35:22.550
SIXTEEN NIGHTS SO THE FACT IS

01:35:22.616 --> 01:35:23.918
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE AVAILING

01:35:23.984 --> 01:35:25.252
THEIR UNITS FOR SHORT TERM

01:35:25.319 --> 01:35:26.020
RENTALS ARE DOING IT FOR OTHER

01:35:26.087 --> 01:35:26.954
REASONS.

01:35:27.021 --> 01:35:28.222
THAN TO MAXIMIZE RIGHT THEY'RE

01:35:28.289 --> 01:35:29.390
NOT TAKING THESE UNITS UP THE

01:35:29.457 --> 01:35:30.825
MARKET THEIR USE IN EITHER MEET

01:35:30.891 --> 01:35:32.426
EXPENSES OR THEY'RE USING IT SO

01:35:32.493 --> 01:35:34.095
THAT THEY CAN SUSTAIN A SECOND

01:35:34.161 --> 01:35:35.563
PROPERTY.

01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:38.632
AND AFFORD IT AND PAY THE

01:35:38.699 --> 01:35:41.035
MORTGAGE -- ONTO THE TRANSFER

01:35:41.102 --> 01:35:42.369

01:40:04.331 --> 01:40:06.767
DAYS FOR HOSTING PLATFORMS LIKE

01:40:06.834 --> 01:40:10.437
AIRBNB AND THE RPO.

01:40:10.504 --> 01:40:12.106
BUT THE HOMEOWNER.

01:40:12.172 --> 01:40:14.608
AND STILL ROUTE.

JUST LIMITS THOSE -- THE HELP

01:40:26.653 --> 01:40:27.921
POSTING PLATFORMS IS THAT

RENTALS WITH OR WITHOUT THIS

01:40:36.497 --> 01:40:37.898
BONE STILL HAS TO FOLLOW THEIR

01:40:37.965 --> 01:40:39.433
LOCAL REGULATIONS.

01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:42.069
AND YOU KNOW SOME IN MY CITY

01:40:42.136 --> 01:40:44.037
THAT HAS TO DO WITH NOTICING --

01:40:44.104 --> 01:40:44.938
NOISE PERMITS AND STUFF LIKE

01:40:45.005 --> 01:40:48.108
THAT AND THE SECOND THING IS --

01:40:48.175 --> 01:40:49.209
THIS IS ONLY REGULATING THE

01:40:49.276 --> 01:40:51.879
PLATFORM SO IF INDIVIDUAL --

01:40:51.945 --> 01:40:53.414
SHORT TERM FATE VACATION RENTAL

01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:55.416
OUR INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNER WANTS

01:40:55.482 --> 01:40:56.950
TO HAVE THEIR OWN WEBSITE AND

01:40:57.017 --> 01:40:58.619
LISTED OR DO IT WITH FRIENDS

01:40:58.685 --> 01:40:59.920
THIS ABSOLUTE DOES NOT TOUCH

01:40:59.987 --> 01:41:01.021
THEIR PROPERTY RIGHTS.

01:41:01.088 --> 01:41:02.156
AND WE CAREFULLY CRAFTED THAT

01:41:02.222 --> 01:41:04.925
BILL THIS BILL TO ENSURE THAT

01:41:04.992 --> 01:41:09.229
THOSE RIGHTS ARE STILL RETAIN --

01:41:09.296 --> 01:41:12.666
THIS IS ONLY THE THANK YOU.

01:41:12.733 --> 01:41:13.367
MR.

01:41:13.434 --> 01:41:14.968
TO WHEN ASKED AS ACOSTA

01:41:15.035 --> 01:41:15.569
COMMISSION WEIGHED IN ON THIS

01:41:15.636 --> 01:41:15.836
ACCOUNT.

01:41:15.903 --> 01:41:17.137
SO I BELIEVE THE COASTAL

01:41:17.204 --> 01:41:18.205
COMMISSION WHEN WE MET WITH THEM

01:41:18.272 --> 01:41:20.007
SHE'S GOING TO SURGERY TODAY FOR

01:41:20.073 --> 01:41:21.108
ANY SURGERY.

01:41:21.175 --> 01:41:23.243
AND THEY HAVE -- GONE THROUGH A

01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:25.012
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WHERE THEY

01:41:25.078 --> 01:41:25.913
HAVE REVIEWED THE BILLS THEY

01:41:25.979 --> 01:41:27.281
HAVE NOT TAKEN POSITIONS ON THE

01:41:27.347 --> 01:41:29.049
BILLS BUT IN FACT THE COSTA

01:41:29.116 --> 01:41:30.317
COMMISSIONER FROM SAN FRANCISCO

01:41:30.384 --> 01:41:31.885
MADE A COMMENT SAYING HE WAS SO

01:41:31.952 --> 01:41:32.986
EXCITED ABOUT THE BILL.

01:41:33.053 --> 01:41:34.254
AND HE LOOKS FORWARD FOR TO THE

01:41:34.321 --> 01:41:35.689
OPPORTUNITY OF BEING ABLE TO

01:41:35.756 --> 01:41:39.326
SUPPORT IT -- I BELIEVE THAT

01:41:39.393 --> 01:41:39.960
WILL HAPPEN IN MAY AT THEIR NEXT

01:41:40.027 --> 01:41:40.828
MEETING.

01:41:40.894 --> 01:41:41.862
I HAVE.

01:41:41.929 --> 01:41:43.063
TO MENTION AND I'VE HAD A COUPLE

01:41:43.130 --> 01:41:43.964
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR

01:41:44.031 --> 01:41:45.032
FIRST OF ALL VERY MUCH

01:41:45.098 --> 01:41:46.400
APPRECIATE.

01:41:46.467 --> 01:41:47.701
THE WORK YOU'RE PUTTING TO THIS

01:41:47.768 --> 01:41:49.403
THIS IS A REALLY DIFFICULT SET

01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:51.638
OF ISSUES -- AS I HAD MENTIONED

01:41:51.705 --> 01:41:53.540
TO YOU -- IN SAN FRANCISCO I

01:41:53.607 --> 01:41:56.410
SPENT SEVERAL YEARS CRAFTING SAN

01:41:56.477 --> 01:41:58.078
FRANCISCO'S REGULATORY STRUCTURE

01:41:58.145 --> 01:41:59.046
BEFORE I CAME HERE TO THE

01:41:59.112 --> 01:42:01.181
ASSEMBLY AND IT WAS REALLY THE

01:42:01.248 --> 01:42:02.783
FIRST TIME IN OUR STATE.

01:42:02.850 --> 01:42:03.450
THAT WE HAD GRAPPLED WITH THESE

01:42:03.517 --> 01:42:05.252
ISSUES AND A FEW THINGS I WOULD

01:42:05.319 --> 01:42:06.820
SAY ABOUT THAT ARE ONE FROM MY

01:42:06.887 --> 01:42:09.456
PERSPECTIVE EVERY JURISDICTION

01:42:09.523 --> 01:42:11.291
HAS VERY VERY LOCAL CONDITIONS

01:42:11.358 --> 01:42:12.493
THAT.

01:42:12.559 --> 01:42:13.393
DETERMINE WHAT OUGHT TO HAPPEN

01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:16.296
HERE -- BUT FOR FOR ME AS A

01:42:16.363 --> 01:42:17.297
CHAIR THE HOUSING COMMITTEE I

01:42:17.364 --> 01:42:18.265
THINK THE AFFORDABILITY

01:42:18.332 --> 01:42:19.867
ARGUMENTS ARE CUTS BOTH WAYS ON

01:42:19.933 --> 01:42:21.768
THE ONE HAND I CERTAINLY SUPPORT

01:42:21.835 --> 01:42:23.136
THE IDEA THAT.

01:42:23.203 --> 01:42:24.671
YOU SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO RENT

01:42:24.738 --> 01:42:25.939
A SPACE FULL TIME AROUND THE

01:42:26.006 --> 01:42:28.041
YEAR THAT DOES ABSOLUTELY

01:42:28.108 --> 01:42:28.809
DEPRIVE HOUSING TO A LOCAL

01:42:28.876 --> 01:42:29.643
COMMUNITY.

01:42:29.710 --> 01:42:31.912
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND -- AS WAS

01:42:31.979 --> 01:42:33.313
MENTIONED THERE ARE SO MANY

01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:35.449
PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY

01:42:35.516 --> 01:42:36.483
THE RENT AND PAY THE MORTGAGE

01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:37.684
AND I THINK GIVING SOME

01:42:37.751 --> 01:42:39.353
FLEXIBILITY. TO THOSE

01:42:39.419 --> 01:42:41.088
INDIVIDUALS ALLOW THEM TO LIVE

01:42:41.154 --> 01:42:42.489
IN HIGH COST AREAS AND THAT

01:42:42.556 --> 01:42:44.224
CERTAINLY WAS THE CASE IN SAN

01:42:44.291 --> 01:42:45.192
FRANCISCO ON WHICH IS WHY WE

01:42:45.259 --> 01:42:47.794
CAME UP WITH THE NINETY DAY MARK.

01:42:47.861 --> 01:42:49.229
AS OPPOSED TO I KNOW THE THIRTY

01:42:49.296 --> 01:42:50.430
DAY MARK THAT IS BEING DISCUSSED

01:42:50.497 --> 01:42:52.799
HERE -- I ALSO JUST WANT TO SEND

01:42:52.866 --> 01:42:54.568
THE ISSUES OF TAXES I'M STILL A

01:42:54.635 --> 01:42:56.637
LITTLE PUZZLED AS TO WHAT THE

01:42:56.703 --> 01:42:58.038
TAX COLLECTION ISSUES HAVE BEEN

01:42:58.105 --> 01:42:59.373
GIVEN HOW MANY CITIES ARE

01:42:59.439 --> 01:43:00.741
COLLECTING TAXES.

01:43:00.807 --> 01:43:02.342
WITH REAL ACCOUNTABILITY I'M NOT

01:43:02.409 --> 01:43:03.977
REALLY I'D LOVE TO KNOW MORE

01:43:04.044 --> 01:43:05.112
ABOUT WHY SAN DIEGO HAS HAD

01:43:05.178 --> 01:43:08.448
CHALLENGES -- IN THAT REGARD --

01:43:08.515 --> 01:43:10.317
AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY BECAUSE

01:43:10.384 --> 01:43:12.085
IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT SOMEHOW OF

01:43:12.152 --> 01:43:15.389
A IN OUR CITY FULL TIME RENTALS --

01:43:15.455 --> 01:43:16.590
ARE CONTINUING TO CREATE AN

01:43:16.657 --> 01:43:18.792
ISSUE AND AND WE HAVE BAND FULL

01:43:18.859 --> 01:43:20.894
TIME RENTALS AROUND THE CLOCK IN

01:43:20.961 --> 01:43:21.528
SAN FRANCISCO AND WHEN WE DID

01:43:21.595 --> 01:43:22.362
THAT.

01:43:22.429 --> 01:43:23.764
WE SAW THE NUMBER OF LISTINGS GO

01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:25.232
DOWN BY HALF.

01:43:25.299 --> 01:43:25.732
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS

01:43:25.799 --> 01:43:26.934
APPROPRIATE -- BUT I JUST WANNA

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.602
MENTIONED -- THAT I AGREE WITH

01:43:28.669 --> 01:43:30.203
THAT ASPECT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:32.272
TODAY -- AS I CHAIR WITH YOU I

01:43:32.339 --> 01:43:33.740
THINK IF THIS WERE A STATEWIDE

01:43:33.807 --> 01:43:35.208
BILL I WOULD GIVEN THE

01:43:35.275 --> 01:43:36.443
REGULATORY STRUCTURE THAT WE HAD

01:43:36.510 --> 01:43:38.445
WORKED SO HARD AND OUR CITY TO

01:43:38.512 --> 01:43:39.079
DO.

01:43:39.146 --> 01:43:42.482
I PROBABLY WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:43:42.549 --> 01:43:43.951
SUPPORT THIS BUT AT THIS MOMENT

01:43:44.017 --> 01:43:45.185
I'M GOING TO NOT I'M GONNA LAY

01:43:45.252 --> 01:43:46.253
OFF THE BILL AT TODAY TO SEE HOW

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:46.687
THE PROGRESS GOES.

01:43:46.753 --> 01:43:48.822
IN UPCOMING HEARINGS AND HOPE

01:43:48.889 --> 01:43:50.924
THAT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE --

01:43:50.991 --> 01:43:52.159
ABILITY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE

01:43:52.225 --> 01:43:55.562
NUANCES OF THIS THIS IS A VERY.

01:43:55.629 --> 01:43:57.698
DIFFICULT AND THORNY AREA OF

01:43:57.764 --> 01:43:59.933
REGULATORY POLICY I APPLAUD YOU

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:03.203
FOR DIVING INTO IT -- AND LOOK

01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:03.837
FOR TO TO SEE HOW THIS PROCEEDS

01:44:03.904 --> 01:44:04.838
OVER TIME.

01:44:04.905 --> 01:44:06.640
SURE AND JUST FOR CLARIFICATION

01:44:06.707 --> 01:44:08.875
THIS BILL WAS A EACH PLATFORM

01:44:08.942 --> 01:44:10.077
CAN ONLY LET.

01:44:10.143 --> 01:44:12.145
WHEN THE PRIMARY RESIDENT IS NOT

01:44:12.212 --> 01:44:13.113
ON SITE?

01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:15.816
THE PLATFORM CAN ONLY LIST THAT

01:44:15.882 --> 01:44:18.285
VACATION RENTAL FOR THIRTY DAYS

01:44:18.352 --> 01:44:19.653
THERE ARE THREE PLATFORMS THAT

01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:22.589
EQUALS NINETY DAYS SO THAT IS.

01:44:22.656 --> 01:44:23.523
FOR THE REASON THAT THERE IS THE

01:44:23.590 --> 01:44:25.225
SMALL THAT USED TO HAVE A NINETY

01:44:25.292 --> 01:44:26.360
DAY REGULATION AND HOW DOES

01:44:26.426 --> 01:44:28.128
SECOND FORCE ACROSS THE THREE

01:44:28.195 --> 01:44:29.896
PLATFORMS EACH PLATFORM CAN ONLY

01:44:29.963 --> 01:44:31.565
LIST THAT FOR NINE HAVE FOR

01:44:31.632 --> 01:44:33.000
THIRTY DAYS THAT WHOSE WHOSE

01:44:33.066 --> 01:44:34.501
ASCERTAINING THAT HOW YOU.

01:44:34.568 --> 01:44:36.036
SO EACH PLATFORM CAN ONLY LIST

01:44:36.103 --> 01:44:38.238
THE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS

01:44:38.305 --> 01:44:39.506
FOR THIRTY DAYS SO THERE'S NO

01:44:39.573 --> 01:44:41.208
THERE'S NO Q. MOTIVE THERE'S NO

01:44:41.274 --> 01:44:42.909
WAY WITHIN THE INDUSTRY TO HAVE

01:44:42.976 --> 01:44:43.977
A CUMULATIVE ASSESSMENT THEY

01:44:44.044 --> 01:44:45.345
HAVE TO SHARE DATA.

01:44:45.412 --> 01:44:46.513
BETWEEN THEM AND THERE'S NO WAY

01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:48.081
TO DO THAT SO SORRY I'M I

01:44:48.148 --> 01:44:49.616
MISSPOKE THEY CAN ALL EACH

01:44:49.683 --> 01:44:51.818
PLATFORM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:44:51.885 --> 01:44:52.986
THEIR THIRTY DAYS THAT THEY CAN

01:44:53.053 --> 01:44:53.654
LIST.

01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:55.822
AND ARE THEY REQUIRED TO LET THE

01:44:55.889 --> 01:44:57.324
CITY KNOW WHEN SECOND I'M JUST

01:44:57.391 --> 01:44:59.292
CURIOUS AT WE WE WE DOVE INTO

01:44:59.359 --> 01:45:01.428
THESE ISSUES A SAN FRANCISCO HOW

01:45:01.495 --> 01:45:02.763
A PLATFORM ASCERTAIN STATES AND

01:45:02.829 --> 01:45:03.997
AND I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT THE

01:45:04.064 --> 01:45:04.998
MECHANISM THE ENFORCEMENT

01:45:05.065 --> 01:45:12.005
MECHANISM IS SO SO CURRENTLY --

01:45:12.072 --> 01:45:14.307
AIR AS THE SHORT TERM VACATION

01:45:14.374 --> 01:45:15.208
RENTAL PLATFORM CAN LAST ANY

01:45:15.275 --> 01:45:16.376
SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL

01:45:16.443 --> 01:45:17.577
WHETHER OR NOT THE CITY ALLOWS

01:45:17.644 --> 01:45:18.345
IT WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A

01:45:18.412 --> 01:45:18.979
BANNER NOT IN THE CITY WHETHER

01:45:19.046 --> 01:45:20.280
OR NOT IT VIOLATES THE CITY'S

01:45:20.347 --> 01:45:21.682
PERMITTING WHETHER OR NOT THAT

01:45:21.748 --> 01:45:23.083
PERSON HAS A CITY PERMIT.

01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:24.518
SO THERE'S NO WAY TO REGULATE

01:45:24.584 --> 01:45:27.087
THAT -- SO THAT'S WHY WE'VE GONE

01:45:27.154 --> 01:45:28.355
WITH THIS VERY NEARLY CRAFTED

01:45:28.422 --> 01:45:29.756
SAYING WHAT IS THE

01:45:29.823 --> 01:45:31.324
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PLATFORM

01:45:31.391 --> 01:45:32.859
THE PLATFORM SAYS IF THE

01:45:32.926 --> 01:45:34.194
RESIDENTSNOT ON SITE.

01:45:34.261 --> 01:45:37.197
THEN THE UNIT CAN BE RENTED OUT

01:45:37.264 --> 01:45:38.398
FOR THIRTY DAYS PERIOD SO IF

01:45:38.465 --> 01:45:40.200
KEPT VERY NARROW SO WHAT THE

01:45:40.267 --> 01:45:42.035
PLATFORM CAN AND CAN'T DO.

01:45:42.102 --> 01:45:43.770
AS FOR YOUR THING ON TO UT I

01:45:43.837 --> 01:45:44.538
KNOW OUR EXPERIENCE IN IN CITY

01:45:44.604 --> 01:45:47.374
THIS WAS -- WE REQUESTED THAT WE

01:45:47.441 --> 01:45:49.543
STRUCK A DEAL WITH AIRBNB TO

01:45:49.609 --> 01:45:51.078
COLLECT TOT IN RETURN THAT TO

01:45:51.144 --> 01:45:52.713
THE CITY WE WERE TOLD WE WOULD

01:45:52.779 --> 01:45:54.347
NOT BE TOLL WE WOULD NOT BE

01:45:54.414 --> 01:45:56.516
GIVEN INFORMATION ON WHICH UNITS

01:45:56.583 --> 01:45:57.484
FOR HOW LONG WERE BEING RENTED

01:45:57.551 --> 01:46:00.921
OUT.

01:46:00.987 --> 01:46:02.155
WE WOULD JUST GET THE TOT.

01:46:02.222 --> 01:46:03.356
SO WE WOULD HAVE TO TRUST AIRBNB

01:46:03.423 --> 01:46:04.324
TO GIVE US THOSE UNITS WE WOULD

01:46:04.391 --> 01:46:06.993
HAVE NO WAY TO CROSS REFERENCE.

01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:08.328
DOES IS THAT UNIT RENTING OUT

01:46:08.395 --> 01:46:10.764
ACTUALLY CONFORM WITH OUR

01:46:10.831 --> 01:46:11.798
SHORTER VACATION RENTAL

01:46:11.865 --> 01:46:13.433
PERMITTING PROCESS WHICH WAS

01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:14.935
VERY LOW IT'S TWENTY FIVE

01:46:15.001 --> 01:46:16.136
DOLLARS TO GET A PERMIT YOU TO

01:46:16.203 --> 01:46:17.838
FOLLOW CERTAIN REGULATIONS --

01:46:17.904 --> 01:46:19.072
AND SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF

01:46:19.139 --> 01:46:20.941
THE CHALLENGE OF THE TOT I THINK

01:46:21.007 --> 01:46:21.842
ONE THING I WOULD SAY WE A

01:46:21.908 --> 01:46:23.543
FIGURE THIS OUT IN MANY CITIES

01:46:23.610 --> 01:46:25.045
INCLUDING OURS.

01:46:25.112 --> 01:46:27.180
I KNOW THAT -- MISTER ROSS

01:46:27.247 --> 01:46:28.682
DIDN'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITYTO

01:46:28.749 --> 01:46:29.783
TALK ABOUT THE DOT ISSUE BUT IF

01:46:29.850 --> 01:46:31.218
YOU COULD JUST ADDRESSES FOR A

01:46:31.284 --> 01:46:32.619
MOMENT BECAUSE SEEMS LIKE.

01:46:32.686 --> 01:46:33.754
IF THERE'S A MEETING THE MIND ON

01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:35.822
THIS ISSUE I WOULD ABSOLUTELY

01:46:35.889 --> 01:46:36.890
SUPPORT YOUR JURISDICTION BE

01:46:36.957 --> 01:46:38.592
ABLE TO COLLECT THE TAXES ON

01:46:38.658 --> 01:46:39.760
JUST A LITTLE PUZZLED AS TO

01:46:39.826 --> 01:46:40.794
VOTERS WAS HEARD ABOUT.

01:46:40.861 --> 01:46:42.863
THE REALITY THOUGH IS SMALL

01:46:42.929 --> 01:46:46.066
CITIES CAN'T NEGOTIATE LIKE

01:46:46.133 --> 01:46:47.234
LARGE CITIES.

01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:48.635
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THIS

01:46:48.702 --> 01:46:49.770
BILL DOES IS A EMPOWERS SMALL

01:46:49.836 --> 01:46:50.670
CITIES TO NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH

01:46:50.737 --> 01:46:51.972
THE NEGOTIATIONS.

01:46:52.038 --> 01:46:54.040
IN THE SAME WAY THAT BIG CITIES

01:46:54.107 --> 01:46:55.475
CAN DO IT WE ARE AT AN ISN'T AS

01:46:55.542 --> 01:46:56.810
WE HAVE A STAFF OF TWO HUNDRED

01:46:56.877 --> 01:46:58.111
PEOPLE WE HIRED.

01:46:58.178 --> 01:46:59.813
A PART TIME STAFF FOR NINE

01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:01.248
MONTHS JUST TO LOOK AT THE

01:47:01.314 --> 01:47:03.016
PLATFORMS AND WHAT UNITS WERE

01:47:03.083 --> 01:47:04.584
BEING RENTED OUT. TO CROSS

01:47:04.651 --> 01:47:06.453
REFERENCE THEM TO SEE DID THEY

01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:07.788
PULL OUR PERMITS.

01:47:07.854 --> 01:47:09.422
THIS IS FOR SMALL CITIES WE

01:47:09.489 --> 01:47:11.558
DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO

01:47:11.625 --> 01:47:12.893
THIS.

01:47:12.959 --> 01:47:13.894
TONIGHT I APPRECIATE THAT I MY

01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:15.228
GUESS IS THIS THE COUNTY OF SAN

01:47:15.295 --> 01:47:16.696
DIEGO PROBABLY WOULD HAVE THE

01:47:16.763 --> 01:47:17.497
ABILITY TO PULL EVERYONE

01:47:17.564 --> 01:47:19.299
TOGETHER ON THIS RIGHT AND

01:47:19.366 --> 01:47:20.333
THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS.

01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:21.802

OUR EXPERIENCES.

01:47:26.606 --> 01:47:27.674
IN OTHER PARTS THE STATE COULD

01:47:27.741 --> 01:47:29.476
HELP YOU GUYS COLLECT THE TAXES

01:47:29.543 --> 01:47:31.011

THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO ONLY

01:49:13.613 --> 01:49:14.981
LOOK AT RESIDENTIALLY ZONED

COULD CHOOSE TO DO AND THEN

01:49:46.012 --> 01:49:46.546

SUCH EXAMPLES AS LEERING SHOWING

02:10:52.244 --> 02:10:54.146
CARTOONS THINGS LIKE THAT BUT

02:10:54.213 --> 02:10:55.414
NOT ALL OF THIS INAPPROPRIATE

02:10:55.480 --> 02:10:57.216
BEHAVIOR ACTUALLY RISES TO

02:10:57.282 --> 02:10:58.717
UNLAWFUL SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

02:10:58.784 --> 02:10:59.685
IT HAS TO MEET THE SEVERE

02:10:59.751 --> 02:11:00.919
PERVASIVE STANDARD OR THE QUID

02:11:00.986 --> 02:11:02.521
PRO QUO STANDARD THESE ARE

02:11:02.588 --> 02:11:04.489
SIMPLY EXAMPLES ADDITIONALLY THE

02:11:04.556 --> 02:11:05.457
WAY THE BILL AS CURRENTLY

02:11:05.524 --> 02:11:06.892
DRAFTED -- WHICH I KNOW IS

02:11:06.959 --> 02:11:08.694
STAKING AND CURRENT LAW IS THAT

02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:10.462
IT'S FOR ANY RELIEF IT'S NOT

02:11:10.529 --> 02:11:12.130
JUST LIMITED TO RELIEVE THROUGH

02:11:12.197 --> 02:11:13.665
THE COURT PROCESS IT SAYS ANY

02:11:13.732 --> 02:11:15.901
RELIEF INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED.

02:11:15.968 --> 02:11:16.969
TO SO I KNOW THIS MAY SOUND LIKE

02:11:17.035 --> 02:11:19.238
AN EXTREME EXAMPLE HOWEVER IF I

02:11:19.304 --> 02:11:21.173
WERE TO WALK TO WORK AND GET

02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:22.741
CáC CALLED AT WORK AS LONG AS I

02:11:22.808 --> 02:11:25.010
GIVE MY EMPLOYER ADVANCE NOTICE

02:11:25.077 --> 02:11:26.645
THAT I'M TAKING TIME OFF WORK.

02:11:26.712 --> 02:11:28.413
THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT TO KNOW

02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:30.148
SORT OF VERIFICATION NEEDS TO

02:11:30.215 --> 02:11:31.483
OCCUR AS LONG AS IT'S PRIOR

02:11:31.550 --> 02:11:32.384
NOTICE.

02:11:32.451 --> 02:11:34.353
AND IT COULD BE FOR SOMETHING AS

02:11:34.419 --> 02:11:36.121
SIMPLE AS THIS CAT CALL OR BEAT

02:11:36.188 --> 02:11:37.756
LEERING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

02:11:37.823 --> 02:11:39.224
SO I COULD INFORM MY EMPLOYER

02:11:39.291 --> 02:11:40.659
THAT I'M TAKING TIME OFF WORK I

02:11:40.726 --> 02:11:41.627
COULD ALSO LET MY BROTHER KNOWN

02:11:41.693 --> 02:11:42.861
SEEN DIEGO THAT HE COULD TAKE

02:11:42.928 --> 02:11:44.363
TIME OFF WORK HE COULD TAKE TIME

02:11:44.429 --> 02:11:45.998
OFF WORK FOR THE SAME REASONS TO

02:11:46.064 --> 02:11:46.999

THINGS THAT MIGHT NOT ACTUALLY

RISE TO UNLAWFUL BEHAVIOR.

02:12:09.187 --> 02:12:09.788

SO THAT WAS THE GENESIS AND AND

02:17:23.501 --> 02:17:24.069
THAT'S WHY WE ADDED THAT TO THE

02:17:24.135 --> 02:17:27.639
BILL.

02:17:27.706 --> 02:17:30.609

02:48:21.958 --> 02:48:24.194
FOOD POISONING THAT I'VE EVER.

02:48:24.260 --> 02:48:26.129
EXPERIENCED.

02:48:26.196 --> 02:48:27.831
IT WAS THERE THAT I CAME INTO

02:48:27.897 --> 02:48:29.199
THE CARE OF DOCTOR TYNDALL.

02:48:29.265 --> 02:48:32.302
AND LIKE SO MANY OTHERS WAS PUT

02:48:32.368 --> 02:48:33.770
THROUGH THE ORDEAL OF A FULL

02:48:33.837 --> 02:48:35.738
VAGINAL EXAM FOR SOMETHING

02:48:35.805 --> 02:48:39.776
TOTALLY UNRELATED TO MY ILLNESS.

02:48:39.843 --> 02:48:41.077
THIS WAS ALSO MY FIRST

02:48:41.144 --> 02:48:43.079
GYNECOLOGICAL EXAM.

02:48:43.146 --> 02:48:44.814
AS I HAD NEVER BEEN SEEN BY AN

02:48:44.881 --> 02:48:46.683
OB GM WITH BG WHY AND PRIOR TO

02:48:46.749 --> 02:48:49.452
THAT.

02:48:49.519 --> 02:48:53.156
DR TYNDALL VIOLATED ME.

02:48:53.223 --> 02:48:55.091
I VIVIDLY REMEMBER THAT DAY

02:48:55.158 --> 02:48:57.560
BECAUSE I HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED

02:48:57.627 --> 02:48:58.962
THAT TYPE OF STOMACH PAIN.

02:48:59.028 --> 02:49:00.630
BEFORE IN MY LIFE.

02:49:00.697 --> 02:49:02.432
AND I JUST WANT TO THE FIGURE

02:49:02.499 --> 02:49:04.234
OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON GET TO THE

02:49:04.300 --> 02:49:05.702
BOTTOM OF IT AND GET SOME

02:49:05.768 --> 02:49:06.769
TREATMENT.

02:49:06.836 --> 02:49:08.304
SO WHEN I WAS ASKED TO DISROBE

02:49:08.371 --> 02:49:09.973
AND PUT MY FEET UP IN THE

02:49:10.039 --> 02:49:12.909
STIRRUPS TO GET THE VAGINAL EXAM

02:49:12.976 --> 02:49:14.577
I COMPLETELY COMPLIED I JUST.

02:49:14.644 --> 02:49:16.412
WANTED TO BE OUT OF THIS IMMENSE

02:49:16.479 --> 02:49:18.014
PAIN.

02:49:18.081 --> 02:49:19.949
AFTER THE EXAM WAS DONE I WAS

02:49:20.016 --> 02:49:22.452
TOLD YOU HAVE FOOD POISONING GO

02:49:22.519 --> 02:49:23.419
HOME.

02:49:23.486 --> 02:49:25.822
AND IT'LL PASS WITHIN SEVERAL

02:49:25.889 --> 02:49:27.490
HOURS.

02:49:27.557 --> 02:49:28.558
I WAS LAKE.

02:49:28.625 --> 02:49:30.059
THAT WAS IT I WENT THROUGH ALL

02:49:30.126 --> 02:49:30.727
THAT.

02:49:30.793 --> 02:49:32.729
JUST TO GO HOME.

02:49:32.795 --> 02:49:34.964
IT NEVER THOUGHT WELL WITHIN MY

02:49:35.031 --> 02:49:41.304
SPIRITS.

02:49:41.371 --> 02:49:43.106
IT WASN'T UNTIL I STARTED

02:49:43.172 --> 02:49:44.641
READING STORIES ABOUT WITH

02:49:44.707 --> 02:49:45.942
DOCTOR TYNDALL DID LAST YEAR IN

02:49:46.009 --> 02:49:47.243
THE NEWS.

02:49:47.310 --> 02:49:48.778
THAT MY CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT

02:49:48.845 --> 02:49:51.481
HAPPENED BACK IN.

02:49:51.548 --> 02:49:52.048
NINETEEN NINETY FIVE BECAME

02:49:52.115 --> 02:49:53.650
CRYSTAL CLEAR.

02:49:53.716 --> 02:49:55.018
I IMMEDIATELY REACH OUT TO A

02:49:55.084 --> 02:49:56.019
DEAR FRIEND OF MINE WHO'S A

02:49:56.085 --> 02:49:57.186
PHYSICIAN.

02:49:57.253 --> 02:49:59.756
AND ASKED IS IT NORMAL TO GET A

02:49:59.822 --> 02:50:01.491
FULL VAGINAL EXAM WHEN YOU GET

02:50:01.558 --> 02:50:03.259
FOOD POISONING.

02:50:03.326 --> 02:50:05.461
ANY KIND OF CHUCKLED WITH LAKE

02:50:05.528 --> 02:50:08.498

02:50:08.565 --> 02:50:09.933
LIKE HUNDREDS OF MY FELLOW

02:50:09.999 --> 02:50:11.701
CHOSEN SISTERS.

02:50:11.768 --> 02:50:13.736
I WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY

02:50:13.803 --> 02:50:15.405
SOMEONE WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE.

02:50:15.471 --> 02:50:17.473
MY TRUSTED DOCTOR.

02:50:17.540 --> 02:50:19.776
A DOCTOR THAT USC KEPT EMPLOYED

02:50:19.842 --> 02:50:21.945
AND ALLOWED TO TREAT YOUNG WOMEN

02:50:22.011 --> 02:50:23.379
LIKE ME.

02:50:23.446 --> 02:50:26.182
LONG AFTER REPORTS OF HIS ABUSE.

02:50:26.249 --> 02:50:28.484
MY MOM WAS ABUSED AS A CHILD AND

02:50:28.551 --> 02:50:30.620
SHE CONSTANTLY REMINDED ME HEY

02:50:30.687 --> 02:50:32.355
IF ANYBODY TOUCHES YOU IN AN

02:50:32.422 --> 02:50:33.489
INAPPROPRIATE WAY.

02:50:33.556 --> 02:50:35.258
LET ME KNOW.

02:50:35.325 --> 02:50:37.126

02:50:40.296 --> 02:50:41.864
LET ME KNOW.

02:50:41.931 --> 02:50:43.266
THESE PREDATORS CAN'T BE STOPPED

02:50:43.333 --> 02:50:45.168
UNLESS THE REPORTED.

02:50:45.234 --> 02:50:47.236
AND I KIND OF FEEL ROB TO THAT I

02:50:47.303 --> 02:50:49.005
WAS AN ABLE TO REPORT THAT

02:50:49.072 --> 02:50:51.007
DURING MY TIME BECAUSE I TRUSTED

02:50:51.074 --> 02:50:54.277
USC AND ITS EMPLOYEES TO TAKE

02:50:54.344 --> 02:50:57.113
THE BEST CARE OF ME.

02:50:57.180 --> 02:50:58.915
I HAD TO COME FORWARD TODAY NOT

02:50:58.982 --> 02:51:01.884
JUST FOR ME BUT FOR MY MOM.

02:51:01.951 --> 02:51:03.086
AND FOR THE HUNDREDS OF OTHER

02:51:03.152 --> 02:51:04.988
WOMEN WHO HAVE SAT.

02:51:05.054 --> 02:51:06.856
WITH THEIR SHAME FEAR AND

02:51:06.923 --> 02:51:09.592
MISTRUST ABOUT THE ABUSE THEY

02:51:09.659 --> 02:51:10.927
SUFFER BY SOMEONE WHO'S SUPPOSED.

02:51:10.994 --> 02:51:13.229
TO CARE FOR THEM.

02:51:13.296 --> 02:51:14.697
THIS SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING WHEN

02:51:14.764 --> 02:51:16.165
THIS TYPE OF ABUSE IS ALLOWED TO

02:51:16.232 --> 02:51:20.403
OCCUR FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS.

02:51:20.470 --> 02:51:21.904
THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN WHEN THE

02:51:21.971 --> 02:51:23.406
GOOD NURSES.

02:51:23.473 --> 02:51:25.108
WHO REPORTED THIS HORRENDOUS

02:51:25.174 --> 02:51:28.077
CONDUCT WERE MET WITH INACTION

02:51:28.144 --> 02:51:30.279
OR BETTER WORSE?

02:51:30.346 --> 02:51:33.049
A COMPLETE COVER UP.

02:51:33.116 --> 02:51:34.417
THE SYSTEMIC FAILURE IS

02:51:34.484 --> 02:51:36.552
CONTINUING NOW IS WE TRY TO

02:51:36.619 --> 02:51:37.954
BRING OUR CASE TO COURT.

02:51:38.021 --> 02:51:39.789
THE INSTITUTION THAT ALLOWED THE

02:51:39.856 --> 02:51:41.024

02:51:41.090 --> 02:51:42.258

LIMITATIONS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO

02:51:46.262 --> 02:51:49.365
LIMIT OUR RIGHTS AND OUR VOICES.

02:51:49.432 --> 02:51:52.001
WE WILL NOT BE SILENCED.

02:51:52.068 --> 02:51:54.103
AB FIFTEEN TEN WILL GIVE

02:51:54.170 --> 02:51:56.139

02:52:12.755 --> 02:52:14.624
ON A SUBJECT LIKE THIS IN A VERY

TIME.

02:52:38.781 --> 02:52:39.949
TINDALL WOULD INSTRUCT STUDENTS

02:52:40.016 --> 02:52:41.684
TO LIE NAKED ON THE EXAM TABLE

02:52:41.751 --> 02:52:43.219
WHILE HE SLOWLY INSPECTED EVERY

02:52:43.286 --> 02:52:45.054
PART OF THEIR BODY WHILE AT THE

PHOTOGRAPHING THEIR GENITALIA.

02:52:50.093 --> 02:52:51.394
HE WOULD INSERT HIS UNCLE OF TWO

02:52:51.461 --> 02:52:53.496
FINGERS INSIDE A PATIENT UNDER

02:52:53.563 --> 02:52:54.897
THE GUISE OF A MEDICAL EXAM

02:52:54.964 --> 02:52:56.432
DESPITE BEING COMPLETELY

02:52:56.499 --> 02:52:57.700
UNNECESSARY AND EXTREMELY

02:52:57.767 --> 02:52:59.168
IMPROPER.

02:52:59.235 --> 02:53:01.037
WHILE TYNDALE'S RAMPANT SEXUAL

02:53:01.104 --> 02:53:03.473
ABUSE IS DEEPLY DISTURBING WHAT

02:53:03.539 --> 02:53:05.241
IS PERHAPS MORE DISTURBING IS

02:53:05.308 --> 02:53:07.744
THAT U. S. C. KNEW THAT TEN

02:53:07.810 --> 02:53:09.712
DAHLE HAD BEEN SEXUALLY ABUSING

02:53:09.779 --> 02:53:11.981
STUDENTS FOR DECADES.

02:53:12.048 --> 02:53:13.916
AND DID NOTHING TO STOP IT.

02:53:13.983 --> 02:53:15.384
AFTER THE VIEWS AND COVER UP WAS

02:53:15.451 --> 02:53:18.020
FINALLY MADE PUBLIC IN TWO

02:53:18.087 --> 02:53:19.689

HAVE COME FORWARD AND INITIATED

02:53:23.392 --> 02:53:25.728
ACTIONS AGAINST USC IN

02:53:25.795 --> 02:53:27.630
CALIFORNIA STATE COURT.

02:53:27.697 --> 02:53:29.165
MANY OF THESE VICTIMS HOWEVER

02:53:29.232 --> 02:53:31.834
NOW FACE YET ANOTHER OBSTACLE.

02:53:31.901 --> 02:53:33.136
AN EXPIRED STATUTE OF

02:53:33.202 --> 02:53:34.504
LIMITATIONS.

02:53:34.570 --> 02:53:37.874
AB FIFTEEN TEN PROVIDES A NARROW

ONE YEAR REVIVAL PROVISION TO

02:53:40.143 --> 02:53:41.744
THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS TO

GIVE THESE VICTIMS AN

02:53:43.146 --> 02:53:45.681
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEIR CASE.

02:53:45.748 --> 02:53:47.617
HEARD IN COURT.

02:53:47.683 --> 02:53:49.018
THE ONLY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL

02:53:49.085 --> 02:53:50.920
IS U. S. C..

02:53:50.987 --> 02:53:53.156
USC ARGUES THAT THE THE BILL

02:53:53.222 --> 02:53:55.658
DESTROYS A PROPOSED FEDERAL

02:53:55.725 --> 02:53:57.293
CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT REACHED

02:53:57.360 --> 02:53:59.595
WITHIN ONLY A FEW SHORT WEEKS

02:53:59.662 --> 02:54:02.265
AFTER THE ABUSE WAS CLOSED.

02:54:02.331 --> 02:54:04.000
THIS IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE.

02:54:04.066 --> 02:54:06.569
AB FIFTEEN TEN DOES NOT REVIVED

02:54:06.636 --> 02:54:08.171
CLEANS WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A

02:54:08.237 --> 02:54:09.839
FINAL SETTLEMENT.

02:54:09.906 --> 02:54:11.474
THAT HAS BEEN REACHED.

02:54:11.541 --> 02:54:14.277
USC ARGUES THAT AB FIFTEEN TEN

02:54:14.343 --> 02:54:16.479
DEPRIVES WOMEN OF THE CHOICE TO

02:54:16.546 --> 02:54:18.548
RESOLVE THEIR CLAIMS IN A MANNER

02:54:18.614 --> 02:54:20.049
THAT THEY FEEL APPROPRIATE.

02:54:20.116 --> 02:54:22.752
BUT THE EXACT OPPOSITE IS TRUE.

02:54:22.819 --> 02:54:25.521
AB FIFTEEN TEN PROVIDES WOMEN

02:54:25.588 --> 02:54:27.523
THE CHOICE OF WHETHER TO SEEK

02:54:27.590 --> 02:54:29.358

02:54:33.563 --> 02:54:34.797
THESE VICTIMS SHOULD NOT BE

02:54:34.864 --> 02:54:36.399
HANDCUFFED TO A SETTLEMENT THAT

02:54:36.465 --> 02:54:38.534
THEY MAY BELIEVE IS UNDRESSED.

02:54:38.601 --> 02:54:39.969
IT IS ONLY WITH THE PASSAGE OF

02:54:40.036 --> 02:54:42.004
AB FIFTEEN TEN THAT THESE

02:54:42.071 --> 02:54:44.240

SETTLEMENT PROVIDES WOMEN A

02:58:09.078 --> 02:58:10.880

WHATSOEVER.

02:58:19.455 --> 02:58:22.091

FOR MANY WOMEN THESE CLAUSES CAN

03:14:40.535 --> 03:14:41.936
BE SO BROAD THAT IT FORCES THEM

SCRUTINY FROM A POLICY

03:15:30.218 --> 03:15:31.419
PERSPECTIVE.

03:15:31.486 --> 03:15:32.921
AROUND WHY THEY'RE IMPOSED ON

03:15:32.987 --> 03:15:34.155
WORKERS IN THE FIRST PLACE AND

03:15:34.222 --> 03:15:35.457
WHAT KIND OF IMPACT THEY HAVE ON

03:15:35.523 --> 03:15:37.025
THOSE WORKERS AND THEIR JOB

03:15:37.092 --> 03:15:38.526
OPPORTUNITIES AND AND CAREER

03:15:38.593 --> 03:15:39.527
PATH.

03:15:39.594 --> 03:15:41.830
SO WHY DO YOU EMPLOYERS USE

03:15:41.896 --> 03:15:42.964
THESE ARE REQUIRE THESE NO

03:15:43.031 --> 03:15:44.299
REHIRE CLAUSES AND ALL

03:15:44.365 --> 03:15:45.633
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS.

03:15:45.700 --> 03:15:47.402
THEY SAY IT'S TO PROHIBIT

03:15:47.469 --> 03:15:49.637
EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE ENGAGED IN

03:15:49.704 --> 03:15:51.339
UNLAWFUL OR AGREE JUST CONDUCT

03:15:51.406 --> 03:15:52.574
FROM SEEKING RE EMPLOYMENT FROM

03:15:52.640 --> 03:15:53.875
THE SAME EMPLOYER.

03:15:53.942 --> 03:15:55.076
BUT THEN WHY ARE THEY REQUIRED

03:15:55.143 --> 03:15:57.178
IN ALL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS IF

03:15:57.245 --> 03:15:58.813
THE WORKER ENGAGED IN AGREE JUST

03:15:58.880 --> 03:16:00.081
ARE UNLAWFUL CONDUCT IN THERE

03:16:00.148 --> 03:16:01.716
ARE VALID REASONS JUST NOT TO

03:16:01.783 --> 03:16:03.718
REHIRE THE PERSON. TO THE REASON

03:16:03.785 --> 03:16:05.386
WHY IS BECAUSE IT ALLOWS

03:16:05.453 --> 03:16:06.588
EMPLOYERS TO GET AROUND A

03:16:06.654 --> 03:16:08.323
RETALIATION LAWS AND NOT RE HIRE

03:16:08.389 --> 03:16:09.891
SOMEONE JUST BECAUSE THEY FILED

03:16:09.958 --> 03:16:10.725
THE COMPLAINT.

03:16:10.792 --> 03:16:13.795
WE KNOW THAT EMPLOYERS MAY NOT

03:16:13.862 --> 03:16:15.063
WANT TO RE HIRE SOMEONE. TO SUE

03:16:15.130 --> 03:16:16.397
THEM IN SAY A SEXUAL HARASSMENT

03:16:16.464 --> 03:16:19.300
LAWSUIT BUT THAT IS RETALIATION.

03:16:19.367 --> 03:16:21.236
AND WHY ARE WE ALLOWING

03:16:21.302 --> 03:16:23.238
EMPLOYERS TO INSULATE THEMSELVES

03:16:23.304 --> 03:16:24.873
FROM ANY SORT OF RETALIATION

03:16:24.939 --> 03:16:26.808
CLAIM WHEN ONE WORKERS MAY HAVE

03:16:26.875 --> 03:16:28.309
A VALID RETALIATION CLAIM IF

03:16:28.376 --> 03:16:29.677
THEY'RE NOT RE HIRED

03:16:29.744 --> 03:16:31.079
JUST BECAUSE THEY FILE THE

03:16:31.146 --> 03:16:31.813
COMPLAINT AND SETTLED THEIR

03:16:31.880 --> 03:16:33.748
CLAIM WHICH IS THE POSITION OF

03:16:33.815 --> 03:16:35.917
THE EOC AND TO WIN THESE CAUSES

03:16:35.984 --> 03:16:38.219
ARE SO OVER BRIAN AND

03:16:38.286 --> 03:16:40.088
UNNECESSARY IF AGAIN THERE ARE

03:16:40.155 --> 03:16:42.290
VALID REASONS TO NOT RE HIRE THE

03:16:42.357 --> 03:16:43.057
PERSON.

03:16:43.124 --> 03:16:46.961
SO WE THINK THESE NO REHIRE

CLAUSES.

03:16:47.529 --> 03:16:48.263

BUT THE BILL IS PLAINLY IN MY

03:20:11.032 --> 03:20:13.434
VIEW OVER BROAD IT APPLIES TO

WITH THE COMPANY FOR ANY

03:20:17.805 --> 03:20:19.073
EMPLOYMENT TO SPEND.

03:20:19.140 --> 03:20:20.375
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SEXUAL

03:20:20.441 --> 03:20:22.410
HARASSMENT HERE WE'RE TALKING

03:20:22.477 --> 03:20:24.545
ABOUT GARDEN VARIETY EMPLOYMENT

03:20:24.612 --> 03:20:26.948
DISPUTES WHERE FOR EXAMPLE AT

03:20:27.014 --> 03:20:29.417
THAT COHORT OF EMPLOYEES WILL BE

03:20:29.484 --> 03:20:31.452
BAKING THE EMPLOYER TO DO

03:20:31.519 --> 03:20:33.087

WE FINALLY MAKE A DEAL.

03:20:41.396 --> 03:20:42.597
TO TERM BUT TO SEPARATE FROM THE

WANT YOU BACK.

03:20:48.002 --> 03:20:50.138

CRAFT THIS BILL MORE NARROWLY TO

03:20:53.341 --> 03:20:54.642

THE ADDITIONAL -- THING I WOULD

03:21:02.850 --> 03:21:05.052
SAY IS THE USE OF THESE NO RE

03:21:05.119 --> 03:21:07.188

03:21:10.224 --> 03:21:12.493
TO HR AND LEGAL EMPLOYMENT

LAWYERS TALK ABOUT HOW TO USE

03:21:14.495 --> 03:21:15.963
THEM WHEN TO USE THEM HOW TO

03:21:16.030 --> 03:21:18.566
CRAFT THEM NARROWLY TO AVOID THE

CALL IT AND THAT'S ESSENTIALLY.

03:23:33.434 --> 03:23:34.168

AFTER THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT A

03:23:46.147 --> 03:23:48.249
NUMBER OF VARIOUS AREAS WHERE

03:23:48.316 --> 03:23:49.750

03:24:44.805 --> 03:24:46.407
STRENGTHENS THE CALIFORNIA FALSE

03:24:46.474 --> 03:24:48.609
CLAIMS ACT AND THE REALLY

03:24:48.676 --> 03:24:51.012
IMPORTANT FOR PROTECTING --

MARTIN GLAD I HAD THE FALSE

03:25:04.091 --> 03:25:04.825
CLAIMS UNIT IN THE TWENTY

03:25:04.892 --> 03:25:05.960
GENERAL'S OFFICE.

AND WE SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION

03:25:08.462 --> 03:25:09.664
TO STRENGTHEN OUR ABILITY TO GET

03:25:09.730 --> 03:25:11.932
MONEY BACK FROM PEOPLE WHO CHEAT

03:25:11.999 --> 03:25:14.035
THE STATE -- AND WE ALSO WANT TO

03:25:14.101 --> 03:25:16.203
DETER OTHER PEOPLE FROM DOING

03:25:16.270 --> 03:25:17.438
THAT IN THE FUTURE.

03:25:17.505 --> 03:25:18.706
ARE THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT HAS

03:25:18.773 --> 03:25:20.741
BEEN A VERY EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR

03:25:20.808 --> 03:25:22.043
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

03:25:22.109 --> 03:25:24.178
MY UNIT IS SO FAR RECOVERED

03:25:24.245 --> 03:25:26.480
APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT FOUR

03:25:26.547 --> 03:25:27.515
BILLION DOLLARS.

03:25:27.581 --> 03:25:29.383
WELL THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS

03:25:29.450 --> 03:25:31.552
UNDER THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT.

03:25:31.619 --> 03:25:33.387
I SHOULD ALSO ADD THAT.

03:25:33.454 --> 03:25:35.089
THE WORK OF OUR UNIT HAS NOT

03:25:35.156 --> 03:25:36.390
COME OUT OF THE STATE BUDGET WE

03:25:36.457 --> 03:25:38.259
ARE ENTIRELY SELF FUNDED FROM

03:25:38.325 --> 03:25:41.262
OUR RECOVERY -- THAT WILL REMAIN

03:25:41.328 --> 03:25:43.230
IN SO IN THE FUTURE AND ANY WORK

03:25:43.297 --> 03:25:45.466
WE DO PURSUING TAX FRAUD WILL BE

03:25:45.533 --> 03:25:49.603
ENTIRELY SELF FUNDED -- I I KNOW

03:25:49.670 --> 03:25:50.871
THAT ISSUE HAS BEEN RAISED ABOUT

03:25:50.938 --> 03:25:52.873
THE JURY ALL THE STANDARD -- THE

03:25:52.940 --> 03:25:55.576
ISSUE IS ABOUT DEFENDANTS WHO

03:25:55.643 --> 03:25:57.044
TRY TO AVOID LIABILITY.

03:25:57.111 --> 03:25:58.879
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THEY LIED

03:25:58.946 --> 03:26:00.314
AND TRIED TO CHEAT THE STATE.

03:26:00.381 --> 03:26:03.317
THE STATE PAID THE CLAIM DESPITE

03:26:03.384 --> 03:26:05.152
KNOWING IT MIGHT BE FALSE.

03:26:05.219 --> 03:26:06.487
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE ARE

03:26:06.554 --> 03:26:08.589
MANY REASONS WHY THE STATE MIGHT

03:26:08.656 --> 03:26:11.325
PAY A CLAIM EVEN IF THEY SUSPECT

03:26:11.392 --> 03:26:12.393
IT'S FALSE.

03:26:12.460 --> 03:26:13.828
I'LL GIVE YOU ONE REASON ONE

03:26:13.894 --> 03:26:15.596
VERY GOOD REASON SOMETIMES IF

03:26:15.663 --> 03:26:17.698
WE'RE INVESTIGATING THE CLAIM WE

03:26:17.765 --> 03:26:19.433
DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING TO TIP

03:26:19.500 --> 03:26:20.401
OFF THE DEFENDER.

03:26:20.468 --> 03:26:21.702
SO THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO

03:26:21.769 --> 03:26:23.037
PAY THE CLIENT ANOTHER REASON

03:26:23.104 --> 03:26:23.871
WOULD BE.

03:26:23.938 --> 03:26:25.339
AT THEIR PROVIDING A SERVICE

03:26:25.406 --> 03:26:27.007
THAT CAN'T BE REPLACED THIS

03:26:27.074 --> 03:26:29.710
NEARBY VULNERABLE POPULATION.

03:26:29.777 --> 03:26:31.045
THERE MANY MANY KINDS OF REASONS

03:26:31.112 --> 03:26:33.280
WHY THE GOVERNMENT WOULDN'T

03:26:33.347 --> 03:26:35.683
AUTOMATICALLY CUT OFF PAYMENT.

03:26:35.750 --> 03:26:37.251
JUST BECAUSE SOME SAYS THE CLAIM

03:26:37.318 --> 03:26:39.286
MIGHT BE FALSE I ALSO WANT TO

03:26:39.353 --> 03:26:40.588
NOTE THAT WE DON'T WANT TO

03:26:40.654 --> 03:26:41.455
ENCOURAGE.

03:26:41.522 --> 03:26:42.957
IT PUT THE GOVERNMENT IN THE

03:26:43.023 --> 03:26:43.891
SITUATION.

03:26:43.958 --> 03:26:45.559
WHERE IN ORDER TO PRESERVE A

03:26:45.626 --> 03:26:47.628
POSSIBLE FALSE CLAIM THEY HAVE

03:26:47.695 --> 03:26:49.296
TO IMMEDIATELY CUT OFF PAYMENT?

03:26:49.363 --> 03:26:51.031
AS SOON AS SOMEBODY SAYS THERE'S

03:26:51.098 --> 03:26:52.466
SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS ABOUT THE

03:26:52.533 --> 03:26:53.501
CLAIM.

03:26:53.567 --> 03:26:54.401
THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE

03:26:54.468 --> 03:26:56.203
GOVERNMENT IT ALSO WOULDN'T BE

03:26:56.270 --> 03:26:57.638
GOOD FOR THE CONTRACTORS SO.

03:26:57.705 --> 03:26:59.373
WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST

03:26:59.440 --> 03:27:01.175
