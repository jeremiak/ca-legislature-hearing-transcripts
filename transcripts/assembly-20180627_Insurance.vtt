THE BARREN EARTH WAS SUCH HEAT.

00:35:20.885 --> 00:35:22.587
THAT AN IMPERVIOUS CRUST FORMED

00:35:22.653 --> 00:35:25.189
ON THE SURFACE SO WHEN THE RAINS

00:35:25.256 --> 00:35:27.425

REPELLENT LAYER.

00:35:29.093 --> 00:35:31.062
IMPEDED THE ABILITY OF THE SOIL

TO ABSORB ANY SIGNIFICANT

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.999
MOISTURE RESULTING IN A DEBRIS

00:35:35.066 --> 00:35:36.300

THEIR LOSSES.

00:36:19.911 --> 00:36:21.312
AND MANY OF THESE PEOPLE.

00:36:21.379 --> 00:36:23.915
ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING FOLKS

00:36:23.981 --> 00:36:25.249
WHO HAPPEN TO LIVE IN AN AREA

00:36:25.316 --> 00:36:28.519
THAT WAS DECIMATED BY THE FIRE.

00:36:28.586 --> 00:36:29.120
AND MANY OF THESE PEOPLE ARE

00:36:29.186 --> 00:36:31.589
VERY SOPHISTICATED INDIVIDUALS

00:36:31.656 --> 00:36:33.524

PROCESS.

00:36:46.504 --> 00:36:48.372
AND YET A PUBLIC DEBATE HAS

00:36:48.439 --> 00:36:49.974
EMERGED ABOUT WHETHER HOMEOWNERS

00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:52.577
INSURANCE POLICIES WILL COVER

00:36:54.812 --> 00:36:56.314
WHETHER COVERAGE FOR THIS PERIL

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:01.152
MUCH OF THIS DEBATE CENTERS ON

00:37:01.218 --> 00:37:02.987
WHETHER FIRE CAUSE MUD FLOWS ARE

00:37:03.054 --> 00:37:04.922
CONSIDERED TO RESOLVE FROM A

00:37:17.168 --> 00:37:18.703
WE NOW REMEMBERING THAT THIS

00:37:18.769 --> 00:37:20.404
MUCH FLOW OCCURRED TWO WEEKS

00:37:20.471 --> 00:37:22.473
AFTER THE FIRE THERE'S VERY

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:25.042
LITTLE ARGUMENT THAT THE FIRE.

00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:27.912
AND THE DECIMATION OF ALL OF THE

00:37:27.979 --> 00:37:30.147
SURROUNDING AREAS AND I AS I

00:37:30.214 --> 00:37:30.815
MENTIONED THIS CROSS THAT

00:37:30.881 --> 00:37:32.550
DEVELOP OVER VIRTUALLY THE

MOUNTAINS.

00:37:35.987 --> 00:37:37.655
WAS THE WHAT THEY CALL THE

00:37:37.722 --> 00:37:39.423
EFFICIENT PROXIMATE CAUSE OF

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:40.257

HOMEOWNERS POLICY.

00:37:51.168 --> 00:37:52.536
WOULD COVER DAMAGE FROM THE MUD

00:37:52.603 --> 00:37:54.405
FLOWS LATER THAT MONTH THE

00:37:54.472 --> 00:37:56.374
DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE SOUGHT

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:57.875
TO CLARIFY THE ISSUE OF COVERAGE

00:37:57.942 --> 00:37:59.243
THROUGH A NOTICE ISSUED TO

STUCK IN UNNECESSARY DISPUTES

00:38:24.101 --> 00:38:25.269
WITH THEIR INSURERS?

00:38:25.336 --> 00:38:26.971
NOW MANY OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE

00:38:27.038 --> 00:38:29.040

PROBLEM IN THE LONGER THIS MUCH

00:38:46.657 --> 00:38:48.693
DAYS THE MORE IT CREATES THE

POTENTIAL FOR MOLD.

00:38:50.428 --> 00:38:52.096

00:39:17.088 --> 00:39:18.622
WHICH A LOSSES MOST DIRECTLY

00:39:18.689 --> 00:39:20.658
ATTRIBUTABLE EVEN THOUGH OTHER

00:39:20.725 --> 00:39:22.760
CAUSES MAY FOLLOW IT.

00:39:22.827 --> 00:39:24.428
AND OPERATE MORE IMMEDIATELY IN

00:39:24.495 --> 00:39:26.630
PRODUCING THE LOSS THAT DESPITE

00:39:26.697 --> 00:39:28.199
THIS LONG STANDING PRECEDENT

00:39:28.265 --> 00:39:30.167
INSURERS CONTINUE TO DISPUTE

00:39:30.234 --> 00:39:31.602
WHETHER HOMEOWNERS POLICIES

00:39:31.669 --> 00:39:33.738
PROVIDE COVERAGE WHEN LOSSES

00:39:33.804 --> 00:39:35.506
OCCURRED DUE TO MUD FLOWS THAT

00:39:35.573 --> 00:39:36.574
WERE THEMSELVES.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.142
BECAUSE BY OTHER COVERED PERIL

00:39:38.209 --> 00:39:39.777
SUCH AS WILDFIRE.

00:39:39.844 --> 00:39:41.011
IN THE CASE OF MONTECITO

00:39:41.078 --> 00:39:42.980
RESIDENTS THIS CONFUSION IN THE

00:39:43.047 --> 00:39:44.281
MARKETPLACE AGAIN LEAVES

00:39:44.348 --> 00:39:46.217
HOMEOWNERS WONDERING WHETHER THE

00:39:46.283 --> 00:39:48.652
LOSS OF FOR MANY THEIR LARGEST

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:50.254
SINGLE ASSET THEIR HOME.

00:39:50.321 --> 00:39:52.423
WILL BE COVERED BY INSURANCE AND

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:53.791
I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU FOR MANY

00:39:53.858 --> 00:39:55.459
OF THESE PEOPLE THEY HAVE BEEN

00:39:55.526 --> 00:39:57.862
LAND RICH AND CASH POOR.

00:39:57.928 --> 00:39:59.864
MANY OF THEM ARE SENIORS WHO

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:00.698
HAVE THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE

00:40:00.765 --> 00:40:01.866
GOING TO BE ABLE TO LIVE OUT THE

00:40:01.932 --> 00:40:03.300
REST OF THEIR LIVES IN THEIR

00:40:03.367 --> 00:40:04.935
HOMES THAT THEY OWN FREE AND

00:40:05.002 --> 00:40:06.370
CLEAR BECAUSE THEY HAVE VERY

00:40:06.437 --> 00:40:09.573
LITTLE ELSE. TO RELY UPON.

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.442
THIS BILL AIMS TO CODIFY

00:40:11.509 --> 00:40:13.144
CALIFORNIA'S A FISHMAN PROXIMATE

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:15.246

00:40:15.312 --> 00:40:16.747

AS AMENDED IN THE SENATE

00:40:18.115 --> 00:40:19.617

00:40:22.086 --> 00:40:23.654
DAMAGE RESULTS FROM A

00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:25.956
COMBINATION OF PERILS. ONE OF

00:40:26.023 --> 00:40:27.291
WHICH IS A LANDSLIDE.

00:40:27.358 --> 00:40:29.693
COVERAGE SHALL BE PROVIDED IF AN

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.862
INSURED PERIL IS THE EFFICIENT

00:40:31.929 --> 00:40:32.930
PROXIMATE CAUSE OF THE LOSS OR

00:40:32.997 --> 00:40:34.632
DAMAGE.

00:40:34.698 --> 00:40:36.300
THIS FORMULATION OF DOCTRINE

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:37.802
FOLLOWS THE RELEVANT PRECEDENT

00:40:37.868 --> 00:40:38.936
THAT EXISTS ALREADY IN

00:40:39.003 --> 00:40:41.338
CALIFORNIA LAW SUCH AS THE HOWL

00:40:41.405 --> 00:40:43.574
VERSUS STATE FOREIGN CASE AS

00:40:43.641 --> 00:40:44.909
WELL AS THAT USED BY THE

00:40:44.975 --> 00:40:46.110
DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE.

00:40:46.177 --> 00:40:47.778
IN ITS JANUARY NOTICE TO THE

00:40:47.845 --> 00:40:49.880
INDUSTRY CRITICALLY THE SOURCES

00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:51.582
EXPRESS THE DOCTRINE IN

00:40:51.649 --> 00:40:53.250
AFFIRMATIVE LANGUAGE THAT'S WAY

00:40:53.317 --> 00:40:55.452
IT APPEARS IN THE CASE LAW AND

00:40:55.519 --> 00:40:56.921
WE HAVE BASICALLY TRANSFERRED

00:40:56.987 --> 00:40:57.454
THAT.

00:40:57.521 --> 00:40:59.757
AFFIRMATIVE LANGUAGE INTO THIS

00:40:59.824 --> 00:41:02.560
LEGISLATION COVERAGE SHALL BE

00:41:02.626 --> 00:41:04.395
PROVIDED THAT'S THE LANGUAGE OF

00:41:04.461 --> 00:41:06.096
THIS BILL NOT IN THE DOUBLE

00:41:06.163 --> 00:41:07.565
NEGATIVES LIKE COVERAGE SHALL

00:41:07.631 --> 00:41:08.732
NOT BE DENIED.

00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:09.967
AS SOME STAKEHOLDERS WOULD

00:41:10.034 --> 00:41:11.402
PREFER.

00:41:11.468 --> 00:41:12.636
THERE'S NO CASE LAW THAT I'M

00:41:12.703 --> 00:41:13.804
AWARE OF IN NOTHING THAT'S BEEN

00:41:13.871 --> 00:41:15.773
PRESENTED BY THE INSURANCE

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.241
INDUSTRY THAT ARE THAT

00:41:17.308 --> 00:41:18.642
APPROACHES THE SUBJECT IN THE

00:41:18.709 --> 00:41:19.476
NEGATIVE.

00:41:19.543 --> 00:41:20.945
AS THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY

00:41:21.011 --> 00:41:24.448
SUGGESTS I WOULD INVITE THE VERY

00:41:24.515 --> 00:41:27.551
CONFUSION I'M TRYING TO AVOID SO

00:41:27.618 --> 00:41:28.986
THAT THESE PEOPLE IF THEY HAVE.

00:41:29.053 --> 00:41:31.255
APPROPRIATE COVERAGE IF THEY ARE

00:41:31.322 --> 00:41:33.290
INDEED COVERED FOR FIRE.

00:41:33.357 --> 00:41:34.391
THE MUD SLIDE BEING THE

00:41:34.458 --> 00:41:36.694
PROXIMATE CAUSE OF THEIR LOSSES

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.829
AND THAT AGAIN IS SOMETHING THAT

00:41:38.896 --> 00:41:40.264
GETS TO BE DETERMINED BUT IT'S

00:41:40.331 --> 00:41:42.533
VERY HARD AND VERY FEW PEOPLE

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.468
ARE TO A ARE TAKING THE POSITION.

00:41:44.535 --> 00:41:45.703
THAT IT WAS IN THE FAR THE

00:41:45.769 --> 00:41:47.238
BECAUSE THIS MONTH SO I WOULD

00:41:47.304 --> 00:41:48.606
NOT LOOKING THREE YEARS DOWN THE

00:41:48.672 --> 00:41:50.274

00:41:50.341 --> 00:41:50.708
LATER.

00:41:50.774 --> 00:41:53.310
THIS EVENT HEARD NOW I HAVE.

00:41:53.377 --> 00:41:54.411
A BEEN WORKING WITH THE

00:41:54.478 --> 00:41:55.980

00:41:59.383 --> 00:42:00.985
CONCERN --

00:42:01.051 --> 00:42:01.752
THAT.

00:42:01.819 --> 00:42:03.320
WELL THIS MIGHT ALLOW PEOPLE WHO

00:42:03.387 --> 00:42:04.688
HAVEN'T PAID THEIR FIRE

00:42:04.755 --> 00:42:06.423
INSURANCE TO BE ABLE TO GET

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:07.625
COVERAGE THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE

00:42:07.691 --> 00:42:08.492
TRYING TO DO THAT'S NOT WHAT WE

00:42:08.559 --> 00:42:10.861
THINK THE LEGISLATION SAYS BUT

00:42:10.928 --> 00:42:12.796
WE ARE PREPARED TO TAKE ASSN

00:42:12.863 --> 00:42:16.066
AMENDMENT CLARIFYING LANGUAGE --

00:42:16.133 --> 00:42:18.969
THAT OF WILL AND I DON'T HAVE IT.

00:42:19.036 --> 00:42:21.639
I HEAR IT IS THE BASICALLY SAYS

00:42:21.705 --> 00:42:23.540
NOTHING IN THE ACT ADDING

00:42:23.607 --> 00:42:25.576
SECTION FIFTY OF FIVE THIRTY

00:42:25.643 --> 00:42:26.977

00:42:29.179 --> 00:42:31.682
OR ABROGATE ANY DEFENSES EITHER

00:42:31.749 --> 00:42:34.318

00:42:34.385 --> 00:42:35.853
PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.087
THIS BILL.

00:42:37.154 --> 00:42:38.422
SO IF YOU HADN'T PAGER FIRE

00:42:38.489 --> 00:42:40.124

CURRENT IF YOU ARE UP TO DATE IF

00:42:44.094 --> 00:42:45.029
YOU WOULD BE ENTITLED TO

00:42:45.095 --> 00:42:46.063
COVERAGE --

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:48.065
BECAUSE OF A FIRE BECAUSE THIS

00:42:48.132 --> 00:42:50.301
IS THE OFFICIAL PROXIMATE CAUSE

00:42:50.367 --> 00:42:51.535
THESE MONTH SUCH YOU WILL BE

00:42:51.602 --> 00:42:53.170
COVERED THAT'S ALL THIS BILL

00:42:53.237 --> 00:42:53.837
DOES.

00:42:53.904 --> 00:42:55.339
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THESE

00:42:55.406 --> 00:42:56.273
PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN GET ON WITH

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:58.375
THEIR LIVES MANY OF THEM FRANKLY

00:42:58.442 --> 00:43:00.010
CAN'T REBUILD BECAUSE THEY DON'T

00:43:00.077 --> 00:43:02.079
HAVE ANY LAND LEFT.

00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:05.582
AND NOW THEY ARE IN MAJOR --

00:43:05.649 --> 00:43:08.419
AREAS OF THAT MUCH YOU KNOW

00:43:08.485 --> 00:43:09.920
POTENTIAL FLOODING.

00:43:09.987 --> 00:43:11.021
BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE

00:43:11.088 --> 00:43:12.756
PEOPLE HAVE COVERAGE THEY'RE

00:43:12.823 --> 00:43:14.725
ENTITLED TO GET COMPENSATION

00:43:14.792 --> 00:43:15.492
THEY'RE ENTITLED TO TRY TO

00:43:15.559 --> 00:43:17.227
FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THEIR NEXT

00:43:17.294 --> 00:43:18.696
STEP AND GET ON WITH THEIR LIFE

00:43:18.762 --> 00:43:19.430
THEY'VE BEEN PAYING THEIR

00:43:19.496 --> 00:43:20.597
PREMIUMS.

00:43:20.664 --> 00:43:22.266
AND WITHOUT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY

00:43:22.333 --> 00:43:24.301
ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND I HAVE

00:43:24.368 --> 00:43:26.337

TO TESTIFY AND I APOLOGIZE FOR

00:43:29.206 --> 00:43:31.108
THIS IS --

00:43:31.175 --> 00:43:32.476
SOMETHING THAT OBVIOUSLY IS NEAR

00:43:32.543 --> 00:43:33.777
AND DEAR TO MY HEART THIS IS

00:43:33.844 --> 00:43:35.312
SOMETHING FOR WHICH INSURANCE IS

00:43:35.379 --> 00:43:36.480
INTENDED.

00:43:36.547 --> 00:43:38.082
AND THESE FOLKS.

00:43:38.148 --> 00:43:40.851
REALLY DESERVE TO BE A ABLE TO

00:43:40.918 --> 00:43:42.319
ENFORCE THE TERMS OF THEIR

00:43:42.386 --> 00:43:44.154
CONTRACTS MANY COMPANIES HAVE

00:43:44.221 --> 00:43:45.155
ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED THIS IT

00:43:45.222 --> 00:43:46.857
ISN'T ALL OF THEM.

00:43:46.924 --> 00:43:49.026
BUT SOME OF THEM HAVEN'T AND IT

00:43:49.093 --> 00:43:50.861
RATHER THAN HAVE THIS CONFUSION

00:43:50.928 --> 00:43:52.029

00:52:54.738 --> 00:52:56.673
THEY RE OUR LANGUAGE AND YOUR

00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:57.774
LANGUAGE ARE GONNA.

00:52:57.841 --> 00:52:58.975
REGULAR NON WHERE PEOPLE ARE

00:52:59.042 --> 00:52:59.476
GONNA THINK THEY'RE THAT

00:52:59.543 --> 00:53:00.644
DIFFERENT.

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:03.213
BUT INSURANCE COVERAGE LAWYERS

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:03.847
WITH YEARS AND YEARS OF

00:53:03.914 --> 00:53:05.282
EXPERIENCE ON FELT THAT THEY

00:53:05.348 --> 00:53:06.850
WERE.

00:53:06.917 --> 00:53:10.620
THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE IS HE IN

00:53:10.687 --> 00:53:12.622
HOW THE LANGUAGE IS WRITTEN AND

00:53:12.689 --> 00:53:15.559
SO IN THE BILL YOU KNOW IT SAYS

00:53:15.625 --> 00:53:16.826
AYE BUT COVERAGE MUST BE

00:53:16.893 --> 00:53:18.995
PROVIDED AN IN ON OUR PROPOSED

00:53:19.062 --> 00:53:20.764
LANGUAGE IT SAYS WE MAY NOT

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:21.965
EXCLUDE.

00:53:22.032 --> 00:53:23.567
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE

00:53:23.633 --> 00:53:25.435
AND FOR EXAMPLE.

00:53:25.502 --> 00:53:27.337
JULIAN VERSUS HARTFORD

00:53:27.404 --> 00:53:28.905
UNDERWRITERS INSURANCE THE CASE

00:53:28.972 --> 00:53:30.640
SAYS THIS CASE CALLS ON US TO

00:53:30.707 --> 00:53:33.376
DECIDE WHETHER AN INSURER MAY

00:53:33.443 --> 00:53:35.946
CONSISTENT WITH. FIVE THIRTY

00:53:36.012 --> 00:53:37.080
NINE IN THE OFFICIAL PROXIMATE

00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:39.716
CAUSE DOCTOR AND DENY COVERAGE --

00:53:39.783 --> 00:53:41.651
AND THEN THE SAME THING IN HOW

00:53:41.718 --> 00:53:43.787
WILL VERSUS STATE FARM WE MUST

00:53:43.853 --> 00:53:45.055
DECIDE WHETHER IN INSURANCE AND

00:53:45.121 --> 00:53:46.356
SURPRISING COVERAGE UNDER IN ALL

00:53:46.423 --> 00:53:47.724
RISK INSURANCE.

00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:48.592
AND ALWAYS PROPERTY INSURANCE

00:53:48.658 --> 00:53:50.694
POLICY NAY CONTRACTUALLY EXCLUDE

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.596
COVERAGE --

00:53:52.662 --> 00:53:53.163
THERE'S ALSO LANGUAGE IN THE

00:53:53.229 --> 00:53:55.031
CASE.

00:53:55.098 --> 00:53:56.399
CASES WHERE SENTENCES ARE

00:53:56.466 --> 00:53:58.201
WRITTEN IN THE AFFIRMATIVE AND

00:53:58.268 --> 00:53:59.502
SO YOU CAN PICK OUT THOSE AND IN

00:53:59.569 --> 00:54:01.871
SUPPORT OF MANY --

00:54:01.938 --> 00:54:02.339
FOR STATUTE THAT IS AN

00:54:02.405 --> 00:54:03.540
INFORMATIVE.

00:54:03.607 --> 00:54:06.543
M. BUT WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:09.479
LANGUAGE MOST ACCURATELY --

00:54:09.546 --> 00:54:11.781
REPRESENTS AND CASE LAW I WOULD

00:54:11.848 --> 00:54:14.084
ALSO JUST IN CONCLUSION --

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:16.820
TRY YOUR ATTENTION TO OUR A

00:54:16.886 --> 00:54:18.488
SENTENCE OR A PARAGRAPH IN THE

00:54:18.555 --> 00:54:20.223
ANALYSIS OF THE BOTTOM OF PAGE

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:21.992
TO TOP OF PAGE.

00:54:22.058 --> 00:54:25.762
THREE ON WHICH WHICH REALLY.

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:29.132
OUR EX EXPLAINS THE DANGERS IN

00:54:29.199 --> 00:54:30.667
TRYING TO CODIFY CASE FINE IF I

00:54:30.734 --> 00:54:31.301
MAY.

00:54:31.368 --> 00:54:33.303
ON IT SAYS EFFORTS TO CODIFY

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:35.438
CASE LAW ANY PARTICULAR COMPLEX

00:54:35.505 --> 00:54:37.440
FACT BASED CASE LAW ARE

00:54:37.507 --> 00:54:38.508
INHERENTLY FRAUGHT WITH PROBLEMS

00:54:38.575 --> 00:54:40.210
THEY'RE REALLY ONLY TWO POSSIBLE

00:54:40.276 --> 00:54:42.646
CONSEQUENCES. ONE THE BILL

00:54:42.712 --> 00:54:44.447
ACCOMPLISHES NO ACTUAL CHANGE

00:54:44.514 --> 00:54:46.049
THE LAW BUT ADDS LITIGATION RISK

00:54:46.116 --> 00:54:46.983
IS PARTY'S.

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:48.318
BATTLE WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE

00:54:48.385 --> 00:54:50.387
DISPUTES TO CLARIFY WHETHER OR

00:54:50.453 --> 00:54:51.688
TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK

00:54:51.755 --> 00:54:52.322
CURRENT CASE LAW MAY HAVE BEEN

00:54:52.389 --> 00:54:52.922
MADE.

00:54:52.989 --> 00:54:54.624
AND TO THE BILL UNINTENTIONALLY

00:54:54.691 --> 00:54:56.326
MAKES CHANGES THAT A COURT

00:54:56.393 --> 00:54:58.228
INTERPRETS --

00:54:58.294 --> 00:54:59.295
TO CHANGE OR ALTER THE RESULTS A

00:54:59.362 --> 00:55:01.097
PRIOR CASE LAW IS THE RISK OF

00:55:01.164 --> 00:55:02.866
UNINTENTIONAL AN UNDETERMINED

00:55:02.932 --> 00:55:04.501
CHANGE TO EXISTING LAW WORTH THE

00:55:04.567 --> 00:55:06.036
RISK FOR A BILL THAT EXPRESSES

00:55:06.102 --> 00:55:07.904
THE INTENT. TO NOT CHANGED ON

00:55:07.971 --> 00:55:10.340
EXISTING LAW AT ALL ON THE LINE

00:55:10.407 --> 00:55:12.342
LANGUAGE IN THE BILL REFERS TO

00:55:12.409 --> 00:55:14.577
EARTH MOVEMENTS MUDSLIDES MODE

00:55:14.644 --> 00:55:15.578
MOVEMENT.

00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:17.714
THERE IS ADDITIONAL --

00:55:17.781 --> 00:55:20.050
INSURANCE COVERAGE AVAILABLE FOR

00:55:20.116 --> 00:55:21.384
EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE AND FOR

00:55:21.451 --> 00:55:23.319
FLOOD INSURANCE AND WE WOULD BE

00:55:23.386 --> 00:55:25.588
VERY NERVOUS TO BE REQUIRED TO

00:55:25.655 --> 00:55:27.223
COVER THINGS UP THAT WERE NOT

00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:28.692
COVERED BY AN AUGUST HOMEOWNERS

00:55:28.758 --> 00:55:29.893
INSURANCE POLICY.

00:55:29.959 --> 00:55:32.696
AND SO I REALIZE THAT IT'S TIME

00:55:32.762 --> 00:55:34.564
MUST BE FRUSTRATING FOR YOU ALL

00:55:34.631 --> 00:55:36.666
TO HEAR LAWYERS WHO ARE LIKE

00:55:36.733 --> 00:55:38.234
INCHES APART.

00:55:38.301 --> 00:55:39.769
YOU KNOW FIGHTING TO THE DEATH

00:55:39.836 --> 00:55:40.704
KIND OF TYPE THING AND I AND I

I I JUST GOT TO TELL YOU THAT

00:55:46.009 --> 00:55:49.145
OUR WAR ON EXPERIENCED --

00:55:49.212 --> 00:55:50.680
LAWYERS -- I

00:55:50.747 --> 00:55:52.549
FEEL THAT OUR LANGUAGE IS THE

00:55:52.615 --> 00:55:54.918
ONE THAT ACCURATELY REPRESENTS A

00:55:54.984 --> 00:55:56.853
CASE LINE SO UNLESS THE BILL AS

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.221
AMENDED TO ACCEPT THOSE

00:55:58.288 --> 00:55:59.856
AMENDMENTS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY

00:55:59.923 --> 00:56:00.423

CORRECTED.

ANYONE ELSE SPEAKING AGAINST THE

00:57:33.149 --> 00:57:35.685
BILL --

00:57:35.752 --> 00:57:37.754
SENATOR YOU'RE WELCOME --

TO SUMMARIZING CONCLUDE.

00:57:40.123 --> 00:57:42.559
IF I MAY HELP MY THIS MAN

00:57:42.625 --> 00:57:45.328
REPRESENTS MORE THAN THIRTY

00:57:45.395 --> 00:57:46.863
LAWYERS AND YOU KNOW WE CAN'T

00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:50.166
LAWYERS [inaudible]

00:57:50.233 --> 00:57:52.235
PAN AFRICAN [inaudible]

00:57:52.302 --> 00:57:56.472
BUT I'VE I WOULD WELL LIMP WHEN.

00:57:56.539 --> 00:57:57.373
I THINK IN IN THE YOU KNOW I

00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:59.576
WOULD RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE --

00:57:59.642 --> 00:58:01.244
THAT THE CASE LAW IS NOT AS

00:58:01.311 --> 00:58:02.145
CLEAR.

00:58:02.212 --> 00:58:03.246
OF THE KIDS THAT WE'VE TAKEN

00:58:03.313 --> 00:58:05.615
THIS LANGUAGE DIRECTLY FROM THE

00:58:05.682 --> 00:58:07.417
SEMINAL CASES ON THIS ISSUE.

00:58:07.483 --> 00:58:09.552
MY CONCERN IS THAT THE THE

00:58:09.619 --> 00:58:11.688
INDUSTRY IS FIGHTING SO HARD NOT

00:58:11.754 --> 00:58:13.423
TO USE THE LANGUAGE.

00:58:13.489 --> 00:58:15.592
THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE GOAL

00:58:15.658 --> 00:58:18.695
HERE IS TO ELIMINATE CONFUSION --

00:58:18.761 --> 00:58:20.730
AS WAS INDICATED WHICH JUST WE

00:58:20.797 --> 00:58:22.131
WE NEED EVERYBODY ON THE SAME

00:58:22.198 --> 00:58:23.533
PAGE HERE.

00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:25.969
AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND

00:58:26.035 --> 00:58:28.338
TAKING THE AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY.

00:58:28.404 --> 00:58:30.340
COULDA WOULDA SHOULDA WE HAVE

00:58:30.406 --> 00:58:31.274
TIGHTENED THIS SHOP WHERE WE'RE

00:58:31.341 --> 00:58:33.276
BASICALLY MIRRORING THE LANGUAGE

00:58:33.343 --> 00:58:35.211
SO THAT THERE'S NO DISPUTE AND

00:58:35.278 --> 00:58:35.745
LET ME TELL YOU WHY THAT'S

00:58:35.812 --> 00:58:37.680
IMPORTANT.

00:58:37.747 --> 00:58:41.818
COUPLE WEEKS AGO I GOT AN EMAIL.

00:58:41.885 --> 00:58:43.086
FROM A WOMAN NAMED MRS CANTON.

00:58:43.152 --> 00:58:45.521
HER SON JACK.

00:58:45.588 --> 00:58:46.556
IS -- WAS

00:58:46.623 --> 00:58:48.524
SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD.

00:58:48.591 --> 00:58:50.360
AND WHEN THE DEBRIS FLOW SWEPT

00:58:50.426 --> 00:58:52.028
THROUGH THEIR HOME.

00:58:52.095 --> 00:58:55.331
JACK IN HIS DAD WERE SWEPT AWAY.

00:58:55.398 --> 00:58:57.867
HIS HIS STATS BODY WAS FOUND.

00:58:57.934 --> 00:58:59.369
BUT JACK CAN'T IN AGE SEVENTEEN

00:58:59.435 --> 00:59:01.404
IS STILL MISSING.

00:59:01.471 --> 00:59:02.939
AND I GOT AN EMAIL FROM HIS

00:59:03.006 --> 00:59:04.641
MOTHER ASKING.

00:59:04.707 --> 00:59:06.175
WHY THEY HAVEN'T CLEANED UP THE

00:59:06.242 --> 00:59:08.077
MUD?

00:59:08.144 --> 00:59:08.878
BECAUSE SHE BELIEVES THAT HER

00:59:08.945 --> 00:59:11.214
SON'S REMAINS ARE IN THE MUD.

00:59:11.281 --> 00:59:14.584
AND THERE ARE SO MANY PLACES AND

00:59:14.651 --> 00:59:16.519
SO MANY HOMES WHERE THE MUD IS

00:59:16.586 --> 00:59:18.154
JUST SITTING THERE.

00:59:18.221 --> 00:59:21.057
SHE ASKED WHY CAN'T THEY CLEAN

00:59:21.124 --> 00:59:22.492
THIS UP SO THAT I CAN FIND MY

00:59:22.558 --> 00:59:24.527
SON.

00:59:24.594 --> 00:59:26.195
AND I THINK THAT'S A LEGITIMATE

00:59:26.262 --> 00:59:28.331
QUESTION THE FACT THAT THERE IS

00:59:28.398 --> 00:59:30.333
SO MANY OF THESE CLAIMS HAVE NOT

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.201
YET BEEN RECONCILED.

00:59:32.268 --> 00:59:33.269
SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TOLD

00:59:33.336 --> 00:59:35.505
DON'T TOUCH THE AREA ON YOUR

00:59:35.571 --> 00:59:38.241
LAND UNTIL WE RESOLVE THIS CLAIM.

00:59:38.308 --> 00:59:41.010
AND AS I MENTIONED FOR THEM IT

00:59:41.077 --> 00:59:42.245
IS THE DETERIORATION OF THEIR

00:59:42.312 --> 00:59:44.881
PROPERTY. FOR THIS WOMAN IT'S

00:59:44.948 --> 00:59:46.282
TRYING TO FIND THE REMAINS OF

00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:47.984
HER SONG.

00:59:48.051 --> 00:59:49.886
THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR THIS AND

00:59:49.953 --> 00:59:51.287
THIS BILL WILL.

00:59:51.354 --> 00:59:54.157
JUST CLARIFY AS WAS TESTIFIED

00:59:54.223 --> 00:59:56.259
WHICH JUST SEEKING CLARITY THIS

00:59:56.326 --> 00:59:58.962
IS THE LAW WE WANT TO CODIFY IT

00:59:59.028 --> 01:00:00.229
SO THAT THERE'S NO MISTAKE.

01:00:00.296 --> 01:00:02.565
I'M HAPPY DO CONTINUE WORKING IF

01:00:02.632 --> 01:00:03.766
THERE REALLY IS SOMETHING

01:00:03.833 --> 01:00:05.268
LEGITIMATE HERE.

01:00:05.335 --> 01:00:06.469
BUT WE DON'T NEED TO KNOW HOW

01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:08.304
MANY ANGELS CAN DANCE ON THE

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:09.339
HEAD OF A PIN.

01:00:09.405 --> 01:00:11.374
THE LAW IS THERE.

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:13.009
THE NEED IS THERE AND I WOULD

THE TIME OF THE GARBAGE

01:01:38.828 --> 01:01:42.098
DECISIONS --

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:44.100
AND WE'RE PASSING A BILL WITHOUT

01:01:44.167 --> 01:01:45.368
REFERENCE SEEN.

01:01:45.435 --> 01:01:46.536
AN INSURANCE COOPER VERSION ON

01:01:46.602 --> 01:01:48.304
THAT SPECIFIC POINT.

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:50.073
THE RULE OF LAW STATED THERE IS

01:01:50.139 --> 01:01:51.007
WHY WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA

01:01:51.074 --> 01:01:53.176
EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY.

01:01:53.242 --> 01:01:54.077
AND THEN IN THE WAKE OF THAT

01:01:54.143 --> 01:01:56.579
RULE.

01:01:56.646 --> 01:01:58.081
WHEN THEY WANT TO SAY?

01:01:58.147 --> 01:01:59.048
THAT IF YOU HAVE AN EARTHQUAKE%

01:01:59.115 --> 01:02:02.618
WITH FIRE FOLLOWING --

01:02:02.685 --> 01:02:04.287
THE FIRE POLICY STILL PROVIDES

01:02:04.353 --> 01:02:06.622
COVERAGE ON THE FIRE ISSUES.

01:02:06.689 --> 01:02:07.323
THERE'S A VERY SPECIFIC

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:10.126
STATUTORY RULE ENACTED IN.

01:02:10.193 --> 01:02:11.894
EIGHTY EIGHT IT COVERS THAT.

01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:14.363
CRISP AND TO THE POINT.

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:16.466
NOTWITHSTANDING SECTION TWENTY

01:02:16.532 --> 01:02:18.401

ZERO EIGHT EIGHT EXEMPTS INSURER.

01:02:19.602 --> 01:02:20.970
FROM ITS OBLIGATION OF A FIRE

01:02:21.037 --> 01:02:22.572
INSURANCE POLICY TO COVER LOSSES

01:02:22.638 --> 01:02:24.273
OF A FIRE.

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:25.208
WHICH JUST BECAUSE BAR FALLS

01:02:25.274 --> 01:02:27.143
EARTHQUAKE AND AND I SORT OF

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:29.212
FEEL IF THE CONCERN IS LAND

01:02:29.278 --> 01:02:31.147
MOVEMENT MUD FLOW OTHER SORTS OF

01:02:31.214 --> 01:02:33.616
THINGS ARE RISING FROM A FIRE.

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:34.951
AND COVERAGE BEING PROVIDED

01:02:35.017 --> 01:02:37.153
UNDER FIRE POLICY.

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:39.522
WHY DON'T WE JUST SAY THAT?

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:40.990
INSTEAD OF ANNOUNCING A BROAD

01:02:41.057 --> 01:02:42.291
WILL DO AN EFFICIENT PROXIMAL

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:45.194
CAUSATION WE'RE DECADES LATER

01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:47.029
PASSED NEW RULE THAT DOESN'T

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:48.698
ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING.

01:02:48.764 --> 01:02:50.199
CONCEPTS IZZY ARE ALREADY IN

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:53.569
THEIR COATS IT FEELS TO BE.

01:02:53.636 --> 01:02:54.971
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE SAYING ALL

01:02:55.037 --> 01:02:56.439
WE ARE DOING JUST SCRIBING CASE

01:02:56.506 --> 01:02:57.940
LAW.

01:02:58.007 --> 01:02:59.142
BUT WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY PUT IN

01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:00.343
THAT CASE ON THE FRAMEWORK IN

01:03:00.409 --> 01:03:01.477
WHICH IS EVOLVING ARE CALIFORNIA

01:03:01.544 --> 01:03:03.045
STATUTES [inaudible]

01:03:03.112 --> 01:03:06.916
AND I JUST FEEL OF YOU WANNA

01:03:06.983 --> 01:03:09.085
SURE THERE'S COVERAGE WHEN YOU

01:03:09.152 --> 01:03:09.685
HAVE A FIRE THAT LEASES OTHER

01:03:09.752 --> 01:03:10.386
THINGS.

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:12.555
CAN'T WE JUST SAY THAT.

01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:14.357
I DO FEEL THAT THE AMENDMENT

01:03:14.423 --> 01:03:16.759
THAT'S BEEN OFFERED.

01:03:16.826 --> 01:03:18.127
THAT SAYS YOU SEE YOU'RE GONNA

01:03:18.194 --> 01:03:20.730
RESPECT DEFENSES OF EXISTENCE IN

01:03:20.796 --> 01:03:22.665
CASE LAW OR STATUTE.

01:03:22.732 --> 01:03:25.735
DOES START TO PICK UP ONE ZERO

01:03:25.801 --> 01:03:26.269
ZERO EIGHT EIGHT WHICH IS

01:03:26.335 --> 01:03:27.236
CLEARLY A STATUTORY.

01:03:27.303 --> 01:03:28.738
RULE.

01:03:28.804 --> 01:03:29.572
BUT AGAIN WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:31.140
DISCUSSING THE SORTS OF THINGS

01:03:31.207 --> 01:03:33.809
SO I FEEL THAT THERE'S THERE'S

01:03:33.876 --> 01:03:35.478
VERY ESSENTIAL ON THIS AREA THAT

01:03:35.545 --> 01:03:36.712
WERE ACTING AS IF IT'S NOT ON

01:03:36.779 --> 01:03:38.181
THE BOOKS WERE NOT REALLY.

01:03:38.247 --> 01:03:39.949
FUHRMAN THAT IT'S THERE.

01:03:40.016 --> 01:03:42.218
AND SO IT GIVES ME A A REAL

01:03:42.285 --> 01:03:43.452
DISQUIET.

01:03:43.519 --> 01:03:46.656
AS I READ THIS.

01:03:46.722 --> 01:03:49.458
RIGHT NOW HAVE MY WEAKNESS.

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:50.927
YES I THINK YOUR RESPONSES LATER

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:52.628
APPROPRIATE PALM [inaudible]

01:03:52.695 --> 01:03:56.999
THE THE OFFICIAL PROXIMATE CAUSE

01:03:57.066 --> 01:03:58.834
A DOCTOR AND HOW WITHIN THE

01:03:58.901 --> 01:04:01.204
ANALYSIS OF IT HOW IN THIS BILL

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:02.405
WAS TAKEN.

01:04:02.471 --> 01:04:04.874
DIRECTLY FROM HALL AND GARVEY.

01:04:04.941 --> 01:04:06.409
AND IT ISN'T --

01:04:06.475 --> 01:04:08.411
IT ISN'T ONLY IF IT IS A. AS I

01:04:08.477 --> 01:04:10.413
THINK UBER SAID EARLIER APPLIES

01:04:10.479 --> 01:04:11.948
TO ALL RISK POLICIES NOT JUST

01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:14.350
FIRE POLICIES SO --

01:04:14.417 --> 01:04:16.652
IS A IT'S APPROPRIATE IN THIS

01:04:16.719 --> 01:04:18.621
CONTEXT BECAUSE IT'S AN

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:19.722
APPROPRIATE STATEMENT OF THE LAW

01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:20.756
TO LIMIT IT --

01:04:20.823 --> 01:04:23.226
IN IN SOME OTHER WAY WOULD I

01:04:23.292 --> 01:04:25.161
THINK CONFUSING ISSUE WOULDN'T

01:04:25.228 --> 01:04:26.829
ACTUALLY --

01:04:26.896 --> 01:04:30.066
HELP AND I THINK THE BEST THING

01:04:30.132 --> 01:04:32.034
TO DO IN THIS SITUATION IS TO GO

01:04:32.101 --> 01:04:33.569
WITH THE LAW THAT YOU HAVE

01:04:33.636 --> 01:04:34.837
RATHER THAN.

01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:36.172
TRY TO CREATE A NEW --

01:04:36.239 --> 01:04:39.575
A NEW PARADIGM AND SO.

01:04:39.642 --> 01:04:41.310
THE BILL DOES IS IT TAKES THE

01:04:41.377 --> 01:04:42.478
WHOLE --

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:44.213
DECISION USES THE LANGUAGE OF

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.715
THE WHOLE DECISION FOR EFFICIENT

01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:47.416
PROXIMATE CAUSE --

01:04:47.483 --> 01:04:50.086
IN APPLIES IT A TO THIS CONTEXT

01:04:50.152 --> 01:04:51.387
WHICH IS ONE OF THE CONTEXT

01:04:51.454 --> 01:04:52.989
WHICH OFFICIAL PROXIMATE CAUSE

01:04:53.055 --> 01:04:54.624
APPLIES TO ORANGES IS A MUCH

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:56.726
LIKE.

01:04:56.792 --> 01:04:58.094
A MISTER FRAZIER HAS QUESTION A

UP A VERY VALID POINT.

01:05:15.911 --> 01:05:17.613
WHERE WE SHOULD NARROW THIS?

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:18.914
OPPORTUNITY --

01:05:18.981 --> 01:05:20.483
WE'RE GENERALIZING THIS ON ONE

01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:22.752
INCIDENT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO

01:05:22.818 --> 01:05:24.086
LOOK AT AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR MS

01:05:24.153 --> 01:05:25.921

THIS AMENDMENT.

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:31.127
BUT I HOPE THAT THERE'S AN

01:05:31.193 --> 01:05:33.095
ONGOING PROCESS THAT IT.

01:05:33.162 --> 01:05:34.764
AS IS AS THIS IF IT GETS OUT OF

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:35.064
COMMITTEE.

01:05:35.131 --> 01:05:37.600
THE YOU YOU COMMIT TO WORKING

01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:39.135
WITH THE OPPOSITION. TO COME TO

01:05:39.201 --> 01:05:40.870
YES --

01:05:40.936 --> 01:05:43.372
BECAUSE I MEAN WE HAVE ANOTHER

01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:44.640
WHACK AT THIS IT IT YOU KNOW

01:05:44.707 --> 01:05:46.075
WHAT THE FLOOR.

01:05:46.142 --> 01:05:48.477
AND I'D WOULD HOPE THAT --

01:05:48.544 --> 01:05:50.012
THAT THE CONCLUSION COMING IS A

01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:51.647
MY PERCEPTION IS THIS IS A

01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:53.049
GENERALIZATION OF AN INCIDENT

01:05:53.115 --> 01:05:54.583
THERE'S NOTHING MORE.

01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:56.319
THEN ME FEELING FOR THE THAT

01:05:56.385 --> 01:05:57.820
POOR MOTHER WHO LOST HER SON AND

01:05:57.887 --> 01:05:58.354
HAS.

01:05:58.421 --> 01:05:59.221
NO OPPORTUNITY GET THAT

01:05:59.288 --> 01:06:02.925
INDIVIDUAL YET OKAY I LIVE THAT.

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:04.727
BUT I ALSO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:05.828
THAT THIS IS GOING TO AFFECT THE

01:06:05.895 --> 01:06:07.363
STATE AS A WHOLE [inaudible]

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:10.466
AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE I

01:06:10.533 --> 01:06:12.768
WOULD HOPE THAT THE OPPOSITION

01:06:12.835 --> 01:06:14.003
AND YOU CAN WORK TOWARDS A

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:16.038
SOLUTION AND HOW WE CAN GET THE

01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:17.373
S. OR A COMPROMISE.

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.541
WE'RE BOTH NOT SATISFIED BECAUSE

01:06:18.607 --> 01:06:20.576
THAT'S A COMPROMISE.

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:21.811
WELL I CAN CERTAINLY COMMIT TO

01:06:21.877 --> 01:06:23.112
THAT IF WE CAN'T GET TO A

01:06:23.179 --> 01:06:25.181
COMPROMISE THAT I WILL NOT BRING

01:06:25.247 --> 01:06:27.483
THE BILL ON THE FLOOR --

01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:28.284
IF ARE.

01:06:28.351 --> 01:06:30.619
UP PART OF THE PROBLEM HERE IS

01:06:30.686 --> 01:06:31.787
THAT -- WELL

01:06:31.854 --> 01:06:33.589
THIS IS A SINGLE INCIDENT WE NOW

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:35.091
ARE HAVING FIRES UP IN LAKE

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:37.259
COUNTY THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE

01:06:37.326 --> 01:06:39.228
THIS THE SOUL INCIDENT --

01:06:39.295 --> 01:06:40.696
EVEN THOUGH IT DID OCCUR IN MY

01:06:40.763 --> 01:06:42.164
DISTRICT THAT WE WERE JUST THE

01:06:42.231 --> 01:06:44.367
ONES THAT WERE MOST.

01:06:44.433 --> 01:06:45.901
UNFORTUNATE AT LEAST AT THIS

01:06:45.968 --> 01:06:48.037
POINT TIME SO --

01:06:48.104 --> 01:06:51.340
WEIRD TRYING TO SEE CLARA SPAN

01:06:51.407 --> 01:06:53.008
THE LAW AND I APPRECIATE THE

01:06:53.075 --> 01:06:54.677
CONCERNS THAT OF MISTER COOLEY

01:06:54.744 --> 01:06:56.512
ADDRESSED AND WE ARE HAPPY TO

01:06:56.579 --> 01:06:58.347
LOOK INTO MAKING SOME REFERENCE

01:06:58.414 --> 01:06:58.814
TO THIS.

01:06:58.881 --> 01:07:01.150
BUT YOU SEE AN EARTHQUAKE IS

01:07:01.217 --> 01:07:03.085
GENERALLY NOT A COVERED.

01:07:03.152 --> 01:07:05.988
EVENT IS NOT SO.

01:07:06.055 --> 01:07:08.124
SO THAT AIM MUCH OF FIRE MUCH

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:09.892
LIGHT THAT OCCURS AS A RESULT OF

01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:11.160
AN EARTHQUAKE UNLESS YOU HAVE

01:07:11.227 --> 01:07:12.261
EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE WOULD

01:07:12.328 --> 01:07:13.562
ARGUABLY NOT.

01:07:13.629 --> 01:07:16.265
BE COVERED WE ARE LOOKING AT THE

01:07:16.332 --> 01:07:18.000
INCIDENTS WHERE MOST PEOPLE NOT

01:07:18.067 --> 01:07:19.568
EVERYBODY IN PROBABLY MOST

01:07:19.635 --> 01:07:20.569
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

01:07:20.636 --> 01:07:23.372
INSURANCE HAVE FIRE INSURANCE.

01:07:23.439 --> 01:07:25.007
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:07:25.074 --> 01:07:27.009
HERE IS THE LAW SAYS THAT IF YOU

01:07:27.076 --> 01:07:28.544
HAVE FIRE INSURANCE.

01:07:28.611 --> 01:07:30.346
THAT IS THE OFFICIAL PROXIMATE

01:07:30.413 --> 01:07:33.349
CAUSE OF EARTH MOVEMENT NOT THE

01:07:33.416 --> 01:07:35.284
OTHER WAY AROUND BUT IF IF

01:07:35.351 --> 01:07:36.285
YOU'RE COVERED WITH FIRE

01:07:36.352 --> 01:07:38.954
INSURANCE AND A A MUD FLOOR MUCH

01:07:39.021 --> 01:07:39.989
LIGHTER WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL

01:07:40.055 --> 01:07:41.457
IT OCCURS.

01:07:41.524 --> 01:07:43.058
THAT WAS ESSENTIALLY KICKED OFF

01:07:43.125 --> 01:07:45.661
IF YOU WILL BY THAT DOMINO.

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:48.130
THEN AND AND YOU QUALIFY WITH

01:07:48.197 --> 01:07:49.498
FOR RICHARD SETS THE AMENDMENT

01:07:49.565 --> 01:07:51.434
WE TOOK THAT AFFIRMS THAT ANY

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.135
DEFENSES THE INSURANCE COMPANY

01:07:53.202 --> 01:07:54.236
MIGHT HAVE --

01:07:54.303 --> 01:07:57.406
DID TO THAT BASIC FIRE INSURANCE.

01:07:57.473 --> 01:08:01.110
A POLICY WILL OF BE IN PLAY AS

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:03.646
YOU SEE COMPENSATION OF THE FOR

01:08:03.712 --> 01:08:05.614
THE DEBRIS FLOW.

01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:08.317
A SO THAT SHOULD CLARIFIED AGAIN.

01:08:08.384 --> 01:08:09.985
WHAT THE ARGUMENT SEEMS TO BE IS

01:08:10.052 --> 01:08:11.220
WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE GOING TO

01:08:11.287 --> 01:08:15.524
CHANGE THE CASE LAW LANGUAGE AND

01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:16.025
PUT IT IN THE NEGATIVE?

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:17.693
OR WE'RE GOING TO USE THE CASE

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.361
LAW LANGUAGE AND THE CASE ALL

01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:20.863
LANGUAGE TALKS ABOUT IT IN THE

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.832
AFFIRMATIVE AND BY SWITCHING

01:08:22.898 --> 01:08:25.234
THAT THERE'S AN ARGUMENT THAT.

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:27.203
IT'S NOT THE SAME THING.

01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:28.471
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU GOING TO GET

01:08:28.537 --> 01:08:31.740
FOR LITIGATION MY GOAL HERE IS.

01:08:31.807 --> 01:08:33.809
TO AVOID LITIGATION IS TO CREATE

01:08:33.876 --> 01:08:37.246

MISTER COOLEY HAS A GOOD POINT

01:08:40.916 --> 01:08:42.518
WE DON'T WANT THERE TO BE SO

01:08:42.585 --> 01:08:44.687

01:12:30.412 --> 01:12:32.047
ABOUT FIVE MILES.

01:12:32.114 --> 01:12:33.615
AND IT ENDED UP IN THE OWE IT

01:12:33.682 --> 01:12:35.250
STOPPED ONLY BY THE OCEAN.

01:12:35.317 --> 01:12:36.618
SO ANYWHERE.

01:12:36.685 --> 01:12:37.619
IN THAT AREA THERE'S A

01:12:37.686 --> 01:12:39.955
POSSIBILITY THAT THIS.

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:42.291
YOUNG MAN'S REMAINS ARE LOCATED.

01:12:42.357 --> 01:12:43.959
BUT THE FACT THAT THEY HAVEN'T

01:12:44.026 --> 01:12:45.961
BEEN REMOVING THE MUD FROM SO

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:47.696
MANY OF THESE HOMES AND PART OF

01:12:47.763 --> 01:12:50.799
IT IS BECAUSE OF THE THE CASES

01:12:50.866 --> 01:12:53.235
HAVEN'T BEEN RESOLVED.

01:12:53.302 --> 01:12:54.103
THEY'RE STILL PENDING A

01:12:54.169 --> 01:12:56.105
DETERMINATION ABOUT WHAT THE

01:12:56.171 --> 01:12:57.840
INSURANCE COMPANIES GOING TO DO.

01:12:57.906 --> 01:13:00.409
SO IT IS A PART OF IT IS PERHAPS

01:13:00.476 --> 01:13:02.377
CONFUSION ON THE PARTS OF THE

01:13:02.444 --> 01:13:03.679
INSURANCE COMPANIES THE

01:13:03.746 --> 01:13:05.214

01:13:06.381 --> 01:13:08.383
EXPERIENCES SIMILAR TO THIS WE

01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:10.419
WANT TO BE CLEAR AND AND SOME

01:13:10.486 --> 01:13:11.920
ADJUSTERS HAVE BEEN TERRIFIC AND

01:13:11.987 --> 01:13:13.722
SOME HAVE SAID I HAVE TO GO BACK

01:13:13.789 --> 01:13:14.890

01:13:14.957 --> 01:13:16.425
AND THAT APPROVAL WHICH SIX

01:13:16.492 --> 01:13:17.693
MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD IN THAT

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:18.894

WE CAN HAVE HIM A DISCUSS WITH

01:16:31.887 --> 01:16:33.889
MISTER COOLEY I FRANKLY THINK

01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:35.123
THAT -- THAT

01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:37.025
THERE IS SOME VALIDITY TO THAT

01:16:37.092 --> 01:16:38.493

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.262
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'LL

01:16:40.329 --> 01:16:41.897

THE CASE LAW WHICH IS GOOD WHICH

01:16:50.672 --> 01:16:52.407
YOU FOR A PERIOD OF FORTY FIVE

01:16:52.474 --> 01:16:54.810
YEARS HAS BEEN THE LAW --

01:16:54.876 --> 01:16:56.945

01:16:57.913 --> 01:16:59.548
THE LAW I'D I DON'T WANNA UPSET

01:16:59.614 --> 01:17:02.117
THAT -- SO --

01:17:02.184 --> 01:17:04.219
BUT I'M CERTAINLY I THINK THAT --

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:06.188
IF IF REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN

01:17:06.254 --> 01:17:07.756
AGREE WE'VE TAKEN AN AMENDMENT

01:17:07.823 --> 01:17:08.357
THAT.

01:17:08.423 --> 01:17:09.257
ADDRESS THAT CAME A LONG WAY I

01:17:09.324 --> 01:17:12.928
THOUGHT SORENSEN OPPOSITION

01:17:12.995 --> 01:17:13.996
BECAUSE THE BIG CONCERN THEY

01:17:14.062 --> 01:17:16.365
WERE TALKING ABOUT IS WHAT ABOUT --

01:17:16.431 --> 01:17:18.667
ISSUES WHERE YOU REALLY NOT

01:17:18.734 --> 01:17:20.435
ENTITLED TO FIRE COVERAGE AND

01:17:20.502 --> 01:17:21.970
THAT ISN'T MY GOAL MICHAEL WAS

01:17:22.037 --> 01:17:23.672
IF YOU ARE ENTITLED TO IT.

01:17:23.739 --> 01:17:25.140
THEN YOU CAN GET A YEAR

01:17:25.207 --> 01:17:27.242
INSURANCE WILL COVER THE THESE

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:28.810
THE DEBRIS FLOW THAT IS THE

01:17:28.877 --> 01:17:31.279
PROXIMATE CAUSE AND SO WE TOOK

01:17:31.346 --> 01:17:33.081
THAT LANGUAGE AND AND I I

01:17:33.148 --> 01:17:34.583
BELIEVE THAT THAT DEALT WITH

01:17:34.649 --> 01:17:35.951
WHAT I THINK IS THE REAL ISSUE.

01:17:36.018 --> 01:17:38.186

01:17:43.992 --> 01:17:45.127
IT IS WAS GONNA TAKE SOME

01:17:45.193 --> 01:17:46.661
DISCUSSION BUT I THINK MR

01:19:18.687 --> 01:19:20.889
POLICY TO COVER THE LOSSES.

01:19:20.956 --> 01:19:22.657
SO I THINK A VERY.

01:19:22.724 --> 01:19:23.225
TAILORED STATEMENT THAT JUST

01:19:23.291 --> 01:19:25.026
SAYS.

01:19:25.093 --> 01:19:26.328
IF YOU HAVE THE SORTS A LOSSES

01:19:26.394 --> 01:19:27.529
ARISING FROM A FIRE [inaudible]

01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:29.030
THEY'RE COVERED [inaudible]

01:19:29.097 --> 01:19:30.999
AND THAT.

01:19:31.066 --> 01:19:33.602
THAT GET YOU OUT OF THE REALM OF

01:19:33.668 --> 01:19:34.503
DEBATE OVER WHAT WAS THE

01:19:34.569 --> 01:19:36.805
OFFICIAL PROXIMATE CAUSE.

01:19:36.872 --> 01:19:38.240
HE JUST SAYS WELL IF YOU GOT THE

01:19:38.306 --> 01:19:41.443
FACT PATTERN OF A FIRE.

01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:42.878
AND THESE THINGS INTO.

01:19:42.944 --> 01:19:44.446
IT IS CONTEMPLATE WITHIN THE

01:19:44.513 --> 01:19:48.717
COVERAGE OF A FIRE POLICY UNDER.

01:19:48.783 --> 01:19:53.355
TWENTY EIGHTY ONE I THINK THAT.

01:19:53.421 --> 01:19:56.992
FORD'S GOOD COVERAGE.

01:19:57.058 --> 01:19:57.459
IF FRANKLY [inaudible]

01:19:57.526 --> 01:20:02.130
TEN PARDON ME. FOR MANY MANY

01:20:02.197 --> 01:20:03.565
DECADES UNDER MARK REISNER IS

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:05.267
BOOK A DANGEROUS PLACE WHICH IS

01:20:05.333 --> 01:20:06.902
ABOUT CALIFORNIA.

01:20:06.968 --> 01:20:08.770
AND THE SAN GABRIEL MOUNTAINS

01:20:08.837 --> 01:20:10.205
THAT TRANSVERSELY RANGE

01:20:10.272 --> 01:20:10.505
[inaudible]

01:20:10.572 --> 01:20:13.008
SO DRY.

01:20:13.074 --> 01:20:13.942
VERY STEEP CANYONS VERY STEEPER

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:15.377
BRAINS.

01:20:15.443 --> 01:20:18.880
THE WHOLE HYDROLOGY OF THE SOUTH

01:20:18.947 --> 01:20:21.516
FACE OF THE SAN GABRIELS IS SUCH.

01:20:21.583 --> 01:20:22.150
THAT ONCE WATER SEARCH RUNNING

01:20:22.217 --> 01:20:23.919
DOWNHILL IT IS A TREMENDOUS

01:20:23.985 --> 01:20:25.453
PROBLEM.

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.522
AND SO MUCH OF THE WORK.

01:20:27.589 --> 01:20:29.357
AND THE WATER SYSTEM IN THERE

01:20:29.424 --> 01:20:30.825
REVENGE OF SOUTHERN COMFORT KIND

01:20:30.892 --> 01:20:32.160
OF CONTROL THAT CONTROLLED

01:20:32.227 --> 01:20:34.095
MUDFLOWS CONTROL THE BOULDERS.

01:20:34.162 --> 01:20:37.832
THAT GOES BACK TO THE THIRTIES.

01:20:37.899 --> 01:20:38.967
SO I THINK THERE'S A LIMITS

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:39.701
PAYROLL.

01:20:39.768 --> 01:20:41.803
THAT EXIST THERE ARE RISING FROM

01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:43.305
THE EXPANDING DOWN RESISTS

01:20:43.371 --> 01:20:43.805
BURGER I THINK FOR THOSE

01:20:43.872 --> 01:20:44.673
MOUNTAINS.

01:20:44.739 --> 01:20:45.774
I ACTUALLY THINK YOU'RE GAINING

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:49.844
SOMETHING. TO STATE CLEARLY THAT.

01:20:49.911 --> 01:20:51.012

I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE LANGUAGE

01:20:57.886 --> 01:20:59.287
OF THE YOU KNOW PERHAPS WE COULD

01:20:59.354 --> 01:21:00.889
WE COULD TALK ABOUT THAT NOW.

01:21:00.956 --> 01:21:02.457
IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:05.660
THAN WHAT WE HAVE LIPS DRAFTED

01:21:05.727 --> 01:21:07.362
HERE AND YOU KNOW THERE MIGHT

01:21:07.429 --> 01:21:09.464
BET.

01:21:09.531 --> 01:21:10.899
AND THAT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TO

01:21:10.966 --> 01:21:11.266
SENATOR KERRY.

01:21:11.333 --> 01:21:13.902

WE CAN DO THAT.

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:22.110
I'M HAPPY.

01:21:22.177 --> 01:21:23.478
TO DEAL WITH THE LANGUAGE SHOULD

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:24.813
THAT'S GOING TO ACHIEVE THAT

01:21:24.879 --> 01:21:26.381
GOAL AND REACH.

A UNHEARD OFF IN CALIFORNIA.

01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:04.312
A TO HAVE A FIRE IN DECEMBER SO

WHATEVER THEY ARE.

01:23:24.766 --> 01:23:27.402
SHOULD HAVE THE EXPECTATION THAT

01:23:27.469 --> 01:23:28.937
THEY'RE GOING TO BE COVERED IF

01:23:29.003 --> 01:23:31.206
THESE THE A MAJOR CAP

01:23:31.272 --> 01:23:32.540
CATASTROPHES.

BE CLEAR AND THAT'S WHAT I'M

01:23:36.244 --> 01:23:37.946
TRYING TO GET IS THAT CLARITY

01:23:38.012 --> 01:23:39.881
BASED UPON WHAT HAS BEEN CASE

01:23:39.948 --> 01:23:41.249
LAW ON THE STATE FOR THE LAST

01:23:41.316 --> 01:23:42.617
FIFTY YEARS.

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:44.519
THAT'S THE GOAL WHEN IT AGAIN

01:23:44.586 --> 01:23:45.920
WE'VE WE'VE UNDERSTOOD MS STONE

01:23:45.987 --> 01:23:48.957
TO SAY THAT THERE'S NOT BEEN ANY --

01:23:49.023 --> 01:23:50.358
INSURANCE COMPANY THAT HAS

01:23:50.425 --> 01:23:52.761
RAPIDLY REFUSED TO TO RESPOND TO

01:23:52.827 --> 01:23:54.329
YOUR INCIDENT IN YOUR DISTRICT

01:23:54.396 --> 01:23:55.663

01:23:57.132 --> 01:23:58.533
COMPANIES THAT HAVE NOT RESOLVED

01:23:58.600 --> 01:23:59.701
THESE CLAIMS YET THAT THEY'RE

01:23:59.768 --> 01:24:02.437
STILL OUT FOR CONSIDERATION.

01:24:02.504 --> 01:24:04.372
AND THAT IS TWO SIDES TO A STORY

01:24:04.439 --> 01:24:05.640
AND IT COULD BE ALSO THE INSURED

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:07.609

YEARS FOLLOWING A DISASTER.

01:54:26.459 --> 01:54:28.228
REQUIRES COMPANIES TO REPORT. TO

IT WILL BE TELL IT.

01:54:33.766 --> 01:54:35.335
THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN

01:54:35.401 --> 01:54:39.072
IN THE SENATE --

01:54:39.138 --> 01:54:41.207

OF THE BILL.

01:54:47.213 --> 01:54:48.114
AND THIS IS A HUGE HIT TO MY

01:54:48.181 --> 01:54:49.916
CONSTITUENTS WHO WON'T BE

01:54:49.983 --> 01:54:51.351
PROTECTED BY THE MANY PROVISIONS

01:54:51.417 --> 01:54:52.885
OF THIS BILL EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE

01:54:52.952 --> 01:54:53.987
BEEN PAYING THEIR POLICY

01:54:54.053 --> 01:54:56.155

01:54:58.024 --> 01:54:59.726
DECADES.

01:54:59.792 --> 01:55:00.860
AND ANOTHER --

01:55:00.927 --> 01:55:02.328
RIGHT AMENDMENT TAKEN INSTEAD OF

01:55:02.395 --> 01:55:04.564
ALLOWING IT SHIRTS TO COMBINE

01:55:04.631 --> 01:55:06.332
COVERAGE A. B. AND C. TO COVER

01:55:06.399 --> 01:55:08.101
THE COSTS OF REBUILDING.

01:55:08.167 --> 01:55:10.937
AFTER NATURAL DISASTER --

01:55:11.004 --> 01:55:11.871
WOULD BE LOOKED AT WITH THE

01:55:11.938 --> 01:55:13.573
TOTAL LOSS THE BILL IS.

01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:15.475
LIMITED TO COMBINE CLAIMS FOR

01:55:15.541 --> 01:55:18.177
PROVEN LOSSES IN COVERAGE BEING

01:55:18.244 --> 01:55:19.145
COVERAGE SEE.

01:55:19.212 --> 01:55:23.216
AND USE THOSE FUNDS TO REPLACE

01:55:23.283 --> 01:55:25.351
IF THEY DO NOT HAVE AN ENOUGH

01:55:25.418 --> 01:55:26.719

01:55:26.786 --> 01:55:29.155
INSURANCE COVERAGE.

01:55:29.222 --> 01:55:31.624
NOW THESE AMENDMENTS NARROWED

01:55:31.691 --> 01:55:35.295
THIS BILL INCREDIBLY.

01:55:35.361 --> 01:55:36.896
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE

01:55:36.963 --> 01:55:38.231
COMBINATION OF THE COVERAGE

01:55:38.298 --> 01:55:39.899
PROVISION.

01:55:39.966 --> 01:55:41.901
ONLY APPLIES WITH THERE'S THREE

01:55:41.968 --> 01:55:43.703
CONDITIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MET

01:55:43.770 --> 01:55:44.003
[inaudible]

01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:45.571
DECLARED DISASTER.

01:55:45.638 --> 01:55:48.241
A TOTAL LOSS HE AM INSUFFICIENT

01:55:48.308 --> 01:55:49.175
COVERAGE IN THEIR PRIMARY

01:55:49.242 --> 01:55:51.210
DWELLING COVERAGE TO COVER THE

01:55:51.277 --> 01:55:53.413
COST OF REBUILDING.

01:55:53.479 --> 01:55:54.714
NOW I UNDERSTAND THIS COMMITTEE

01:55:56.115 --> 01:55:57.884
OF AMENDMENTS.

01:55:57.950 --> 01:55:59.485
EVEN THOUGH IT IS DIFFICULT FOR

01:55:59.552 --> 01:56:01.754
ME TO REMOVE THE RETROACTIVITY

01:56:01.821 --> 01:56:02.889

01:56:02.955 --> 01:56:04.590
I THINK BENEFITING EVERYONE IN

THE STATE GOING FORWARD IS TOO

01:56:05.958 --> 01:56:07.760
IMPORTANT TO LET.

01:56:07.827 --> 01:56:09.262
THAT PREVENT THIS BILL FROM

INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS WORKED

DILIGENTLY TO COMMIT TO COME UP

02:04:24.223 --> 02:04:25.591
WITH SOLUTIONS AND TO REACH A

02:04:25.658 --> 02:04:27.092

02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:32.565
WELL WE HAVE TRIED VERY HARD TO

02:04:32.631 --> 02:04:34.333
FIND A SOLUTION FOR S. B. NINETY

02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:35.768
FOUR AS WELL UNFORTUNATELY AT

02:04:35.835 --> 02:04:37.570
THIS JUNCTURE WE MUST CONTINUE

02:04:37.636 --> 02:04:41.240
TO OPPOSE LESS AMENDED SB --

02:04:41.307 --> 02:04:42.141
EIGHT NINETY FOUR SP NINETY FOUR

02:04:42.208 --> 02:04:43.275
ACTUALLY HARM CONSUMERS BY

02:04:43.342 --> 02:04:44.343
REDUCING THEIR CHOICE OF

02:04:44.410 --> 02:04:45.544
INSURANCE PRODUCTION SHOULD THEY

02:04:45.611 --> 02:04:48.314
SUFFER A LOSS TO THEIR HOME.

02:04:48.380 --> 02:04:49.682
THE BILL THREATENS CONTENTS

02:04:49.748 --> 02:04:51.183
COVERAGE AVAILABLE TO HOMEOWNERS

02:04:51.250 --> 02:04:52.818
AS WELL AS IN THE CENTRAL LIVING

02:04:52.885 --> 02:04:54.220
EXPENSE COVERAGE KNOWN AS

02:04:54.286 --> 02:04:55.788
ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSE

02:04:55.855 --> 02:04:57.723
COVERAGE OR A ONLY.

02:04:57.790 --> 02:04:59.592
REGARDING THE CONTENT.

02:04:59.658 --> 02:05:01.861
U. S. B. ID FOUR WOULD FORCE THE

02:05:01.927 --> 02:05:03.495
COMBINATION OF COVERAGES BY

02:05:03.562 --> 02:05:05.898
COMBINING APPLES AND ORANGES.

02:05:05.965 --> 02:05:07.166
THIS OF THE FLAWED ATTEMPT TO

02:05:07.233 --> 02:05:08.801
ADDRESS INSUFFICIENT TROUBLING

02:05:08.868 --> 02:05:10.369
COVERAGE THAT COULD HAVE THE

02:05:10.436 --> 02:05:11.804
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF

02:05:11.871 --> 02:05:12.605
ACTUALLY RESULTING UNDER

02:05:12.671 --> 02:05:14.740
INSURANCE.

02:05:14.807 --> 02:05:16.242
FURTHER IF DIFFERENT COVERED

02:05:16.308 --> 02:05:18.544
FURTHER IF INSURANCE CANNOT TAKE

02:05:18.611 --> 02:05:20.312
INTO ACCOUNT THEIR ACTUAL LOSS

02:05:20.379 --> 02:05:20.813
EXPERIENCE FOR DIFFERENT

02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:21.513
COVERAGES.

02:05:21.580 --> 02:05:22.681
IT WILL EITHER BE FORCED

02:05:22.748 --> 02:05:24.783
INCREASE PREMIUMS OR NOT OFFER

02:05:24.850 --> 02:05:26.418
MORE GENEROUS COVERAGE.

02:05:26.485 --> 02:05:27.253
THIS WILL IMPACT ALL

02:05:27.319 --> 02:05:29.722
CALIFORNIANS HOMEOWNERS.

02:05:29.788 --> 02:05:30.890
WE HAVE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT

02:05:30.956 --> 02:05:31.957
WOULD ALLOW THE COMBINATION OF

02:05:32.024 --> 02:05:33.859
COVERAGE A AND B. THIS THE BIG

02:05:33.926 --> 02:05:35.060
CONCESSION ON THE INDUSTRY PUTS

02:05:35.127 --> 02:05:36.128
PART.

02:05:36.195 --> 02:05:37.463
BUT INSTEAD OF AWKWARD IT WOULD

02:05:37.529 --> 02:05:39.265
INSTEAD OF AWKWARDLY FORCING

02:05:39.331 --> 02:05:40.633
COMBINATION OF CONTENTS COVERAGE

02:05:40.699 --> 02:05:42.101
WOULD PROVIDE HOMEOWNERS A

02:05:42.167 --> 02:05:43.569
PERCENTAGE OF CONTENTS COVERAGE

02:05:43.636 --> 02:05:45.771
WITHOUT PROVIDING AN INVENTORY.

02:05:45.838 --> 02:05:47.339
SO I KNOW THAT MR HER RAIL HAS

02:05:47.406 --> 02:05:50.075
SPOKEN TO THE INVENTORY ISSUE

02:05:50.142 --> 02:05:51.911
AND RIGHT NOW IT THIS BILL DOES

02:05:51.977 --> 02:05:53.579
NOT ADDRESS INVENTORY OUR

02:05:53.646 --> 02:05:55.114
PROPOSAL ALSO WOULD MAKE IT MUCH

02:05:55.180 --> 02:05:56.715
SIMPLER PROCESS.

02:05:56.782 --> 02:05:58.984
IN THAT --

02:05:59.051 --> 02:06:00.953
IN THAT HOMEOWNERS COULD SUBMIT

02:06:01.020 --> 02:06:04.189
25% OR ASK 425% OF THEIR INCOME

02:06:04.256 --> 02:06:05.891
OF THEIR CONTENTS COVERAGE PUT

02:06:05.958 --> 02:06:08.127
OUT INVENTORY THAT CONTENTS --

02:06:08.193 --> 02:06:10.229
COVERAGE OF 25% COULD BE USED IN

02:06:10.296 --> 02:06:11.497
ANY WAY.

02:06:11.563 --> 02:06:13.132
SO I'M BUT UNFORTUNATELY THESE

02:06:13.198 --> 02:06:16.001
AMENDMENTS NOT BEEN ACCEPTED.

02:06:16.068 --> 02:06:17.136
I ALSO --

02:06:17.202 --> 02:06:18.737
WANNA GO INTO ANOTHER ISSUE THAT

02:06:18.804 --> 02:06:20.272
HAS NOT BEEN DISCUSSED THIS MUCH

02:06:20.339 --> 02:06:21.840
AND THAT'S THE DIVISIONAL LIVING

02:06:21.907 --> 02:06:23.342
EXPENSE ISSUE.

02:06:23.409 --> 02:06:25.577
I WANT TO STRONGLY EMPHASIZE THE

02:06:25.644 --> 02:06:27.413
IMPORTANCE OF NOT JEOPARDIZING

02:06:27.479 --> 02:06:28.781
THIS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT SAFETY

02:06:28.847 --> 02:06:30.382
NET FOR HOMEOWNERS IN THE EVENT

02:06:30.449 --> 02:06:32.217
THAT THEY LOSE THEIR HOME.

02:06:32.284 --> 02:06:33.619
HOMEOWNERS ARE MOST AFRAID AND

02:06:33.686 --> 02:06:34.820
DESPONDENT WHEN THEY INITIALLY

02:06:34.887 --> 02:06:35.988
LOSE THEIR HOME AND NEED A PLACE

02:06:36.055 --> 02:06:37.623
TO LIVE.

02:06:37.690 --> 02:06:39.525
DALY IS A SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT TO

02:06:39.591 --> 02:06:40.960
HELP HOMEOWNERS GET BACK ON

02:06:41.026 --> 02:06:43.262
THEIR FEET BY PROVIDING FUNDS

02:06:43.329 --> 02:06:44.863
FOR HOUSING FURNISHING AND OTHER

02:06:44.930 --> 02:06:46.699
LIVING EXPENSES SPEAK OUT THEY

02:06:46.765 --> 02:06:47.733
TRY TO REBUILD THEIR HOMES AND

02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:49.535
THEIR LIVES.

02:06:49.601 --> 02:06:51.603
IN ITS CURRENT FORM SB EIGHT

02:06:51.670 --> 02:06:52.538
NINETY FOUR OVER SO RESULT IN

02:06:52.604 --> 02:06:54.440
HOMEOWNERS LOSING THEIR ABILITY

02:06:54.506 --> 02:06:55.607
TO OBTAIN MORE GENEROUS ALIE

02:06:55.674 --> 02:06:57.810
BENEFITS.

02:06:57.876 --> 02:06:58.877
MANY COMPANIES OFFER A ONLY

02:06:58.944 --> 02:07:00.713
POLICIES THAT HAVE NO DOLLAR

02:07:00.779 --> 02:07:02.348
LIMITS SO THAT HOMEOWNERS CAN

02:07:02.414 --> 02:07:03.983
KEEP THEIR STANDARD OF LIVING.

02:07:04.049 --> 02:07:05.718
THIS IS A HUGE BENEFIT THAT WILL

02:07:05.784 --> 02:07:06.852
NO LONGER BE OFFERED BY MANY

02:07:06.919 --> 02:07:08.754
COMPANIES THEY CANNOT COLLECT

02:07:08.821 --> 02:07:10.489
PREMIUM FOR IT.

02:07:10.556 --> 02:07:12.224
S. B. NINETY FOUR COULD TRIPLE

02:07:12.291 --> 02:07:13.425
PAYOUTS FOR DAILY POLICIES

02:07:13.492 --> 02:07:15.127
WITHOUT DOLLAR LIMITS.

02:07:15.194 --> 02:07:16.295
COMPANIES DO NOT COLLECT PREMIUM

02:07:16.362 --> 02:07:18.263
FOR THIS THE IMPACT WILL BE THE

02:07:18.330 --> 02:07:19.231
COMPANIES WILL STOP OFFERING

02:07:19.298 --> 02:07:21.300
THIS COVERAGE.

02:07:21.367 --> 02:07:23.135
THE INDUSTRY'S AGREED IN A STATE

02:07:23.202 --> 02:07:25.237

AS UNDERDOGS ASK OR HOWEVER

02:07:33.412 --> 02:07:35.447
APPLIANCE EXTENSION TO POLICIES

02:07:35.514 --> 02:07:37.049
WITH OUT DOLLAR LIMITS MAKES NO

02:07:37.116 --> 02:07:38.150
SENSE AND WILL RESULT IN

02:07:38.217 --> 02:07:39.618
HOMEOWNERS LOSING THIS IMPORTANT

02:07:39.685 --> 02:07:40.886

02:16:34.686 --> 02:16:36.488
OBVIOUSLY THE OPPOSITION DOES

02:16:36.555 --> 02:16:37.756
NOT LIKE THAT RIGHT MISTER DODDS

02:16:37.822 --> 02:16:40.358
BILL EXPANDS [inaudible]

02:16:40.425 --> 02:16:41.593
AILEY COVERAGE [inaudible]

02:16:41.660 --> 02:16:43.528
GOING FORWARD.

02:16:43.595 --> 02:16:44.896
AND WHERE OR NOT AND WE'RE NOT

02:16:44.963 --> 02:16:46.298
I'M NOTSUGGESTING AN AMENDMENT

02:16:46.364 --> 02:16:48.166
TO THAT WE ARE ACCEPTING THAT

02:16:48.233 --> 02:16:49.668
PROVISION IN THIS BILL.

02:16:49.734 --> 02:16:51.469
RIGHT THE THE INDUSTRY HAS

02:16:51.536 --> 02:16:52.971
PROBLEMS WITH IT IN THE INDUSTRY

02:16:53.038 --> 02:16:55.340
IS SAYING DOWN THE ROAD.

02:16:55.407 --> 02:16:57.375
THEY MAY HAVE TO ADJUST POLICIES

02:16:57.442 --> 02:16:59.244
AND RATES.

02:16:59.311 --> 02:17:01.146
I'M TO ACCOMMODATE THAT BUT WE

02:17:01.212 --> 02:17:03.048
ARE NOT SUGGESTING ANY CHANGE TO

02:17:03.114 --> 02:17:04.749
MR DODD'S PROPOSAL.

02:17:04.816 --> 02:17:07.018
IN THAT REGARD.

02:17:07.085 --> 02:17:09.354
THEN UP LET ME ADD AGAIN DATA

02:17:09.421 --> 02:17:10.989
FIRST.

02:17:11.056 --> 02:17:13.124
SOME POLICIES DON'T HAVE LIMITS

02:17:13.191 --> 02:17:14.926
AS WAS DESCRIBED BUT THOSE

02:17:14.993 --> 02:17:17.429
POLICIES PAY UNTIL THE HOME IS

02:17:17.495 --> 02:17:19.297
HABITABLE AGAIN.

02:17:19.364 --> 02:17:21.466
SO THAT WAS ALREADY KIND OF

02:17:21.533 --> 02:17:23.735
INCLUDED IN THOSE POLICIES AS A

02:17:23.802 --> 02:17:25.737
PROVISION THAT EXTENDS COVERAGE

02:17:25.804 --> 02:17:28.206
IT DOES A GENEROUS EXTENSION.

02:17:28.273 --> 02:17:29.174
BUT IT IS PART OF HOW THE

02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:30.442
POLICIES.

02:17:30.508 --> 02:17:32.310
WORK NOW WHETHER IT WAS TWO

02:17:32.377 --> 02:17:34.045
YEARS OR THREE YEARS SO THIS

02:17:34.112 --> 02:17:35.680
DOESN'T CHANGE THOSE POLICIES

02:17:35.747 --> 02:17:35.981
[inaudible]

02:17:36.047 --> 02:17:37.716
SECOND.

02:17:37.782 --> 02:17:39.284
THE ANSWERS AREN'T PAYING FOR

02:17:39.351 --> 02:17:41.519
ANYTHING THAT HASN'T.

02:17:41.586 --> 02:17:43.254
BEEN PAID FOR BY THEIR POLICY

02:17:43.321 --> 02:17:44.489
HOLDERS.

02:17:44.556 --> 02:17:46.291
SO ALL OF THESE PROVISIONS

02:17:46.358 --> 02:17:47.792
AREN'T SOMETHING THAT'S COMING

02:17:47.859 --> 02:17:49.527
OUT OF THE IN SHORT BURSTS MONEY

02:17:49.594 --> 02:17:51.830
IT'S COMING OUT OF PREMIUMS PAID

02:17:51.896 --> 02:17:54.165
BY POLICY HOLDERS.

02:17:54.232 --> 02:17:56.167
AND AS SENATOR DRAW SENATOR DODD

02:17:56.234 --> 02:17:58.169
MADE CLEAR THERE'S A TRIPLE

02:17:58.236 --> 02:18:01.406
TRIGGER TO WHEN ANYONE WOULD BE --

02:18:01.473 --> 02:18:03.074
HAVE THE OPTION OF HAVING THESE

02:18:03.141 --> 02:18:04.542
BENEFITS RIGHT.

02:18:04.609 --> 02:18:06.778
THESE BENEFITS ONLY COME WHEN

02:18:06.845 --> 02:18:08.513
YOU HAVE SUFFERED THROUGH.

02:18:08.580 --> 02:18:10.148
A CATASTROPHE.

02:18:10.215 --> 02:18:12.350
YOU HAVE A TOTAL LOSS AND YOU'RE

02:18:12.417 --> 02:18:13.585
UNDER INSURED.

02:18:13.652 --> 02:18:15.954
THAT LIMITS HOW MUCH THE RATES

02:18:16.021 --> 02:18:17.722
ARE GOING THERE EVEN NEED TO BE

02:18:17.789 --> 02:18:20.659
ADJUSTED THIS IS A VERY LIMITED.

02:18:20.725 --> 02:18:23.428
POOL OF POLICY HOLDERS WHO ARE

02:18:23.495 --> 02:18:25.130
GONNA RECEIVE THIS BENEFIT BUT

02:18:25.196 --> 02:18:27.298
THOSE WHO NEED THEM MOST.

02:18:27.365 --> 02:18:28.933
I TELL YOU IS THE FORMER.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:30.368
CHIEF OF OUR RATE REGULATION

02:18:30.435 --> 02:18:32.404
BRANCH THE AFFECT ON PREMIUM

02:18:32.470 --> 02:18:35.340
WOULD BE MINIMAL.

02:18:35.407 --> 02:18:37.575
IT CERTAINLY CLARIFIES SO --

02:18:37.642 --> 02:18:38.977
WHAT POLICY HOLDERS CAN EXPECT

02:18:39.044 --> 02:18:40.745
THOUGH OF [inaudible]

02:18:40.812 --> 02:18:42.714
MOVING FORWARD SHOULD THE BILL

02:18:42.781 --> 02:18:44.149

GOVERNOR IT WILL GIVE IT WILL

02:18:45.583 --> 02:18:47.318
CLARIFY.

02:18:47.385 --> 02:18:50.689
THE SITUATION FOR POLICY HOLDERS.

02:18:50.755 --> 02:18:52.390
FROM OTHER QUESTIONS BY

02:18:52.457 --> 02:18:53.725

AND ARE YOU FOR FILLING THAT

02:19:04.402 --> 02:19:05.737
RESPONSE BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT

02:19:05.804 --> 02:19:07.338
I'M IN A ROOM WITH A LOT OF

02:19:07.405 --> 02:19:08.973
REALLY REALLY SMART PEOPLE WHEN

02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:11.009
IT COMES TO INSURANCE.

02:19:11.076 --> 02:19:12.677
AND BLESS ALL OF YOU --

02:19:12.744 --> 02:19:15.580
IN MY IN MY VERY LIMITED

02:19:15.647 --> 02:19:16.748
KNOWLEDGE --

02:19:16.815 --> 02:19:18.516
AND EXPOSURE TO THE INSURANCE

02:19:18.583 --> 02:19:19.951
INDUSTRY AYE I'VE HEARD A

02:19:20.018 --> 02:19:21.052
STATEMENT THAT.

02:19:21.119 --> 02:19:22.187
THAT'S BOTHERSOME TO ME NOT FROM

02:19:22.253 --> 02:19:24.155
SENATOR --

02:19:24.222 --> 02:19:25.924
SO MUCH BUT IT IS BOTHERSOME TO

02:19:25.990 --> 02:19:28.393
ME BECAUSE IT APPEARS LIKE FOLKS

02:19:28.460 --> 02:19:29.761
THAT ARE REALLY REALLY SMART THE

02:19:29.828 --> 02:19:32.097
INSURANCE INDUSTRY --

02:19:32.163 --> 02:19:34.232
WE SHOULD KNOW OR YOU DO KNOW

02:19:34.299 --> 02:19:36.034
WHAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE

02:19:36.101 --> 02:19:38.069
APPROACHING THIS FROM.

02:19:38.136 --> 02:19:39.738
THE STATEMENT THAT A CONSUMER

02:19:39.804 --> 02:19:41.973
GETS ON THEIR INSURANCE POLICY

02:19:42.040 --> 02:19:43.942
WITH THAT ONE DOLLAR AMOUNT.

02:19:44.008 --> 02:19:45.610
THAT SAYS HERE'S HOW MUCH YOU'RE

02:19:45.677 --> 02:19:47.512
PAYING FOR ALL OF YOUR INSURANCE

02:19:47.579 --> 02:19:47.979
AND THAT'S HOW YOU'RE

02:19:48.046 --> 02:19:49.814
APPROACHING THIS BUT THAT'S NOT

02:19:49.881 --> 02:19:51.549
HOW INDUSTRY RUNS.

02:19:51.616 --> 02:19:53.084
INDUSTRY DOESN'T RUN BASED ON

02:19:53.151 --> 02:19:55.353
THAT ONE FIGURE THAT'S PUBLISHED

02:19:55.420 --> 02:19:57.455
TO THE THE CONSUMER INDUSTRY

02:19:57.522 --> 02:19:58.823
RAIMES BASED ON THE DIFFERENT

02:19:58.890 --> 02:20:00.625
CATEGORIES.

02:20:00.692 --> 02:20:01.793
OF INSURANCE IT'S BEING PROVIDED

02:20:01.860 --> 02:20:03.995
AS A PRODUCT AND THOSE

02:20:04.062 --> 02:20:06.664
CATEGORIES ARE RATED DIFFERENTLY

02:20:06.731 --> 02:20:08.533
SO WHEN YOU SAY WE'RE NOT ASKING

02:20:08.600 --> 02:20:09.601
FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO

02:20:09.667 --> 02:20:10.802
PAY MORE.

02:20:10.869 --> 02:20:13.671
IN ESSENCE YOU KIND OF ARE

02:20:13.738 --> 02:20:14.906
BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T RATED ALL

02:20:14.973 --> 02:20:16.274
OF THOSE CATEGORIES AT THE SAME

02:20:16.341 --> 02:20:17.776
RATE.

02:20:17.842 --> 02:20:19.444
SO WHEN YOU'RE REQUIRING THEM TO

02:20:19.511 --> 02:20:20.779
PUT OUT --

02:20:20.845 --> 02:20:23.515
MONEY OUT OF ONE RATE AND YOU

02:20:23.581 --> 02:20:24.983
SAY WELL IT'S DIRTY IT'S THREE

02:20:25.049 --> 02:20:26.217
YEARS THEY'VE PAID UP THIS MUCH

02:20:26.284 --> 02:20:27.385
MONEY THEY HAVE THIS MUCH

02:20:27.452 --> 02:20:28.419
COVERAGE FOR THREE YEARS THEY

02:20:28.486 --> 02:20:30.054
DIDN'T USE AT ALL SO LET'S TAKE

02:20:30.121 --> 02:20:31.156
THE LEFTOVER INPUTTED INTO

02:20:31.222 --> 02:20:31.956
ANOTHER PART.

02:20:32.023 --> 02:20:34.058
WELL THEY DIDN'T RATE THAT IT

02:20:34.125 --> 02:20:36.594
AND AND I'M MAYBE I AM TOTALLY.

02:20:36.661 --> 02:20:38.129
IN A POSITION TO BE --

02:20:38.196 --> 02:20:39.764
TO BE CORRECTED HERE.

02:20:39.831 --> 02:20:41.132
SO -- IT AND

02:20:41.199 --> 02:20:43.134
YOU CAN CORRECT ME HOWEVER IT'S

02:20:43.201 --> 02:20:45.670
MY UNDERSTANDING IN YOU CAN

02:20:45.737 --> 02:20:46.871
EDUCATE ME AND SCHOOL BUT TO

02:20:46.938 --> 02:20:48.773
HEAR TO KINGDOM COME TODAY.

02:20:48.840 --> 02:20:50.942
BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

02:20:51.009 --> 02:20:53.444
WHEN THEY ARE DOING THAT RATES.

02:20:53.511 --> 02:20:55.847
THEY'RE NOT PLANNING ON REALLY

02:20:55.914 --> 02:20:57.715
PAYING FOR SOMEONE TO BE OFF

02:20:57.782 --> 02:20:59.450
SITE OR PUT ASIDE FOR THREE

02:20:59.517 --> 02:21:01.085
ENTIRE FOUR YEARS.

02:21:01.152 --> 02:21:03.154
THEY'RE TAKING A RATE AND

02:21:03.221 --> 02:21:05.390
THEY'RE RATING THAT AT HEY IT'S

02:21:05.456 --> 02:21:07.258
OUR IN OUR BEST INTEREST TO GET

02:21:07.325 --> 02:21:09.060
THESE PEOPLE BACK IN THEIR HOME

02:21:09.127 --> 02:21:10.495
THAT WE REBUILT FOR THEM AS

02:21:10.562 --> 02:21:12.297
QUICK AS POSSIBLE.

02:21:12.363 --> 02:21:15.733
SO THIS IS A MODEL YOU'RE YOU'RE

02:21:15.800 --> 02:21:17.268
YOU'RE PROTECTING THE CONSUMER

02:21:17.335 --> 02:21:18.436
AND I THINK THAT'S PHENOMENAL I

02:21:18.503 --> 02:21:20.405
THINK GETTING MONEY INTO THEIR

02:21:20.471 --> 02:21:22.307
HANDS AND AN ACTOR MONEY IS

02:21:22.373 --> 02:21:23.274
RIGHT.

02:21:23.341 --> 02:21:24.776
THIS WHOLE UNDERSHIRT ISSUE

02:21:24.843 --> 02:21:26.644
WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH.

02:21:26.711 --> 02:21:29.347
BUT YOUR YOU'RE TAKING MONEY

02:21:29.414 --> 02:21:31.115
FROM ONE CATEGORY THAT'S RATED

02:21:31.182 --> 02:21:33.651
IN ONE WAY AND PAYING AND I'LL

02:21:33.718 --> 02:21:35.253
IN ANOTHER WAY.

02:21:35.320 --> 02:21:37.255
AND THAT'S MESSING WITH I THINK

02:21:37.322 --> 02:21:39.057
THE MODEL [inaudible]

02:21:39.123 --> 02:21:41.593
OF INSURANCE DOING BUSINESS IN

02:21:41.659 --> 02:21:43.461
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:21:43.528 --> 02:21:45.897
NOW AM I NOT SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT

02:21:45.964 --> 02:21:47.699
THE SENATORS I AM.

02:21:47.765 --> 02:21:49.834
VERY MUCH SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT

02:21:49.901 --> 02:21:51.669
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AT HERE'S

02:21:51.736 --> 02:21:52.871
WHAT I'M ASKING.

02:21:52.937 --> 02:21:54.038
FOR AND BY THE WAY THIS WHOLE

02:21:54.105 --> 02:21:56.007
UNDER SHIRT INTO THE I'M A

02:21:56.074 --> 02:21:56.774
LITTLE PREACHY MOTOR --

02:21:56.841 --> 02:21:59.677
THIS WHOLE UNDER INSURED ISSUE

02:21:59.744 --> 02:22:01.012
THAT WE HAVE ISN'T.

02:22:01.079 --> 02:22:02.213
AND I'M NOT SAYING THE SENATORS

02:22:02.280 --> 02:22:03.982
DOING THIS BUT GOING AFTER ONE

02:22:04.048 --> 02:22:05.483
INDUSTRY TO TRY TO FIX THAT

02:22:05.550 --> 02:22:07.852
PROBLEM ISN'T IS IS NOT THE

02:22:07.919 --> 02:22:09.520
ANSWER NOR HAVE YOU EVER SAID IT

02:22:09.587 --> 02:22:10.188
IS.

02:22:10.255 --> 02:22:12.257
BUT IT'S IT'S WHEN YOU HAVE A

02:22:12.323 --> 02:22:13.658
CRISIS OR AN EMERGENCY OR

02:22:13.725 --> 02:22:15.393
TRAGEDY LIKE WE'VE HAD.

02:22:15.460 --> 02:22:19.030
AND YOU HAVE CONTRACTORS.

02:22:19.097 --> 02:22:20.531
THE TIMES THE AMOUNT OR YOU HAVE

02:22:20.598 --> 02:22:23.101
PRODUCT THAT IS INCREASED

02:22:23.167 --> 02:22:25.103
EXPONENTIALLY IN PRICE --

02:22:25.169 --> 02:22:26.704
THOSE THINGS HAVE TO BE DEALT

02:22:26.771 --> 02:22:28.673
WITH AS WELL GOING BACK TO THIS

02:22:28.740 --> 02:22:30.608
MY ASK TO THE SENATOR IS WOULD

02:22:30.675 --> 02:22:31.843
YOU BE WILLING.

02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:33.044
IF THIS BILL WAS TO GET OUT

02:22:33.111 --> 02:22:35.179
TODAY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

02:22:35.246 --> 02:22:36.848
OPPOSITION.

02:22:36.915 --> 02:22:40.184
TRY TO FIND SOME HAPPY MEDIUM.

02:22:40.251 --> 02:22:44.589
MAYBE NOT SO HAPPY SOME MEDIUM --

02:22:44.656 --> 02:22:46.324

NOBODY'S HAPPY BUT WE GOT TO THE

02:22:49.794 --> 02:22:51.296
RIGHT PLACE WHO WOULD YOU BE

02:22:51.362 --> 02:22:52.330
ABLE TO BE --

02:22:52.397 --> 02:22:53.865
COMMIT TO JUST CONTINUING TO

02:22:53.932 --> 02:22:56.734
WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY TO BE

02:22:56.801 --> 02:22:58.836
ABLE TO TRY TO FIND A WAY TO

02:22:58.903 --> 02:23:00.972
ACCOMPLISH WHAT YOU WANT TO DO

02:23:01.039 --> 02:23:02.573
AND THAT'S TO GET MONEY INTO THE

02:23:02.640 --> 02:23:04.309
HANDS OF THE PEOPLE TO GET THEM

02:23:04.375 --> 02:23:05.810
BACK TO THE STATE THEY WERE IN

02:23:05.877 --> 02:23:07.445
BEFORE THE TRAGEDY.

02:23:07.512 --> 02:23:10.181
AND AND DO THAT PRIOR TO

02:23:10.248 --> 02:23:12.550
REACHING THE FLOOR.

02:23:12.617 --> 02:23:14.352
I DID THE ANSWER THE QUESTION IS

02:23:14.419 --> 02:23:15.887
YES PARTICULARLY --

02:23:15.954 --> 02:23:17.588
I HAVEN'T BEEN SO THRILLED WITH

02:23:17.655 --> 02:23:19.691
THE CONSULTANTS AMENDMENTS ON

02:23:19.757 --> 02:23:21.159
THIS BIT HIS COULD THE THOSE

02:23:21.225 --> 02:23:23.962
AMENDMENTS MAY PROVIDE FOR US.

02:23:24.028 --> 02:23:25.763
A FORUM --

02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:27.432
FOR NEGOTIATIONS ON THIS THAT.

02:23:27.498 --> 02:23:28.933
WE YOU KNOW WE DID NOT HAVE

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.703
BEFORE SO --

02:23:31.769 --> 02:23:32.303
SO THE ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IS

02:23:32.370 --> 02:23:34.439
YES.

02:23:34.505 --> 02:23:37.608
IN AS MR GRAYSON SAID --

02:23:37.675 --> 02:23:39.210
THE INDUSTRY DOESN'T LIKE SOME

02:23:39.277 --> 02:23:40.878
PROVISIONS OF THE BILL WHICH I

02:23:40.945 --> 02:23:44.182
THINK ARE REASONABLE AND FAIR.

02:23:44.248 --> 02:23:46.017
MR DOT DOESN'T LIKE SOME OF THE

02:23:46.084 --> 02:23:49.387
PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS --

02:23:49.454 --> 02:23:51.255
AND THAT IS --

02:23:51.322 --> 02:23:52.223
THE BILL EMERGED --

02:23:52.290 --> 02:23:53.024
UNCERTAIN FASHION FROM THE

02:23:53.091 --> 02:23:54.926
SENATE.

02:23:54.993 --> 02:23:56.828
AND ANOTHER BILL THAT HAD SOME

02:23:56.894 --> 02:23:58.329
SIMILAR HAD TO ADDRESS THE SAME

02:23:58.396 --> 02:24:00.231
ISSUES.

02:24:00.298 --> 02:24:02.634
A COMPLETELY FAILED.

02:24:02.700 --> 02:24:05.603
IN THE SENATE AND THE VERY

02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:06.804
CHALLENGING.

02:24:06.871 --> 02:24:08.906
OF ARRAY OF ISSUES HERE BUT I

02:24:08.973 --> 02:24:10.608
THINK THIS IS THE BEST WE'RE

02:24:10.675 --> 02:24:11.743
GONNA DO.

02:24:11.809 --> 02:24:13.444
AS OF TODAY.

02:24:13.511 --> 02:24:15.313
AND CERTAINLY I ENCOURAGE

02:24:15.380 --> 02:24:18.649
ONGOING CONVERSATIONS TO TRY.

02:24:18.716 --> 02:24:19.951
TO TRIED TO GO SOME.

02:24:20.018 --> 02:24:21.753
MAKE MORE FOLKS HAPPY WITH THE

02:24:21.819 --> 02:24:22.587
OUTCOME [inaudible]

02:24:22.653 --> 02:24:24.989
BUT US --

02:24:25.056 --> 02:24:27.025
MISTER FRAZIER HAS QUESTION.

02:24:27.091 --> 02:24:28.359
SO IT'S KIND OF A TWOFOLD

02:24:28.426 --> 02:24:29.994
QUESTION I THINK OF SOME OF THE

02:24:30.061 --> 02:24:30.828
THINGS WE HAVEN'T ACKNOWLEDGED

02:24:30.895 --> 02:24:32.497
TODAY IS.

02:24:32.563 --> 02:24:34.532
THAT ONE A ONE OF A HOMEOWNER IS

02:24:34.599 --> 02:24:36.968
VICTIMIZED BY A NATURAL DISASTER.

02:24:37.035 --> 02:24:39.570
AND OTHER DISPLACED.

02:24:39.637 --> 02:24:40.671
NOBODY IS AN ACKNOWLEDGED THAT

02:24:40.738 --> 02:24:41.172
THEY SOUGHT TO PAY THEIR

02:24:41.239 --> 02:24:42.974
MORTGAGE.

02:24:43.041 --> 02:24:45.343
THERE MORTGAGE DOES NOT GO AWAY.

02:24:45.410 --> 02:24:47.078
AND SO THERE DISPLACED.

02:24:47.145 --> 02:24:48.079
AND THEY'RE HAVING TO PAY FOR

02:24:48.146 --> 02:24:50.715
SOMETHING THAT THEY DON'T HAVE.

02:24:50.782 --> 02:24:52.550
AND I THINK THAT WHAT.

02:24:52.617 --> 02:24:53.985
DOES INSURANCE CENTRICITY OR IS

02:24:54.052 --> 02:24:55.353
IT THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY THAT

02:24:55.420 --> 02:24:56.521
CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:24:56.587 --> 02:24:59.590
MORTGAGE INSURANCE.

02:24:59.657 --> 02:25:00.491
THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY BUILDING

02:25:00.558 --> 02:25:01.025
OKAY.

02:25:01.092 --> 02:25:03.995
AND THE OTHER THING IS IS WHAT I

02:25:04.062 --> 02:25:04.629
LOOK AT INDUSTRY WE LOOK AT PROP

02:25:04.695 --> 02:25:07.865
ONE OF THREE WE LOOK AT WHAT THE

02:25:07.932 --> 02:25:10.068
LEGISLATURE DOES.

02:25:10.134 --> 02:25:11.636
AS FAR AS MANDATES.

02:25:11.702 --> 02:25:14.472
BUT PAIN FROM MY UNDERSTANDING

02:25:14.539 --> 02:25:17.642
IS THAT THE THE COMMISSION.

02:25:17.708 --> 02:25:18.976
OR THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE

02:25:19.043 --> 02:25:20.845
CAN ACTUALLY NOT.

02:25:20.912 --> 02:25:23.581
PROVE A RATE INCREASE.

02:25:23.648 --> 02:25:25.483
OF DO TO A MANDATE.

02:25:25.550 --> 02:25:26.784
ABSOLUTELY I MEAN THAT'S A

02:25:26.851 --> 02:25:28.252
REALLY BIG CONCERN FOR US

02:25:28.319 --> 02:25:29.620
ASSEMBLY MEMBER --

02:25:29.687 --> 02:25:31.456
CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW AND WE DO

02:25:31.522 --> 02:25:33.257
NOT BELIEVE THAT WE ARE PRICE

02:25:33.324 --> 02:25:33.891
ADEQUATE.

02:25:33.958 --> 02:25:36.260
ON EARTH ADEQUATE PREMIUMS ON IN

02:25:36.327 --> 02:25:39.797
GENERAL SO TO PUT MORE PRESSURE.

02:25:39.864 --> 02:25:41.833
ON THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY TO PAY

02:25:41.899 --> 02:25:45.303
OUT MORE WITHOUT BEING ABLE --

02:25:45.369 --> 02:25:46.704
TO COLLECT ADEQUATE PREMIUMS AS

02:25:46.771 --> 02:25:49.407
A BIG ISSUE AND THAT'S AGAIN WHY --

02:25:49.474 --> 02:25:51.209
THE CONCERN IS THAT THERE MAY

02:25:51.275 --> 02:25:52.777
NOT BE THE ABILITY TO OFFER THE

02:25:52.844 --> 02:25:54.645
SAME KIND OF PRODUCTS.

02:25:54.712 --> 02:25:55.279
GENEROUS PRODUCTS THAT WE OFFER

02:25:55.346 --> 02:25:56.681
TODAY.

02:25:56.747 --> 02:25:58.916
I HAVE TWO A DISPUTE THAT I I'M

02:25:58.983 --> 02:26:00.218
NOT SURE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT

02:26:00.284 --> 02:26:02.987
THE YOUR YOUR PREMIUMS IN THE

02:26:03.054 --> 02:26:04.856
DEPARTMENT APPROVES A PREMIUM

02:26:04.922 --> 02:26:05.523
LEVEL.

02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:07.391
THAT WOULD ALLOW AN INSURER TO

02:26:07.458 --> 02:26:10.261
PAY ALL OF ITS COVERED LOSSES.

02:26:10.328 --> 02:26:11.762
THAT'S HOW RATE THE RATE PROCESS

02:26:11.829 --> 02:26:13.498
WORKS.

02:26:13.564 --> 02:26:17.768
SO IF INSURERS LOSSES FROM.

02:26:17.835 --> 02:26:18.336
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WERE

02:26:18.402 --> 02:26:19.470
GREATER THAN THEY PREDICTED THE

02:26:19.537 --> 02:26:22.140
LOSSES FOR TWO THOUSAND

02:26:22.206 --> 02:26:22.707
SEVENTEEN WOULD BE AND THEY

02:26:22.773 --> 02:26:24.308
THINK THEY'RE GONNA HAVE SIMILAR

02:26:24.375 --> 02:26:26.944
LOSSES IN.

02:26:27.011 --> 02:26:27.578
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OR THEY'VE

02:26:27.645 --> 02:26:28.913
AMENDED THEIR COVERAGE IN

02:26:28.980 --> 02:26:31.048
RESPONSE TO LEGISLATION TO GIVE

02:26:31.115 --> 02:26:32.550
BROADER COVERAGE THEY WOULD

02:26:32.617 --> 02:26:33.951
FILED NEW RATES.

02:26:34.018 --> 02:26:36.521
SO TO ABSORB WHATEVER ADDITIONAL

02:26:36.587 --> 02:26:39.090
LOSSES THEY WOULD EXPECT TO

02:26:39.157 --> 02:26:40.625
INCUR IN THE FUTURE.

02:26:40.691 --> 02:26:42.093
OKAY AND THANK YOU SO MISTER

02:26:42.160 --> 02:26:43.694
FRAZIER DO YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM

02:26:43.761 --> 02:26:44.262
THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE

02:26:44.328 --> 02:26:45.897
BECAUSE YOU NEED YOU KNOW RECORD

02:26:45.963 --> 02:26:47.832
QUESTIONS TO THE INDUSTRY ARE

02:26:47.899 --> 02:26:49.133
RATTLING INDUSTRY THANK THANK

02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:50.368
YOU -- THANK

02:26:50.434 --> 02:26:53.538
YOU AND I WILL SAY THAT.

02:26:53.604 --> 02:26:55.773
AS MANDATED BY OR OVERSEEN BY

02:26:55.840 --> 02:26:56.073
[inaudible]

02:26:56.140 --> 02:26:58.075
DEPARTMENT INSURANCE.

02:26:58.142 --> 02:27:00.945
I THINK THAT WE TO GET HEAVY

02:27:01.012 --> 02:27:02.713
HANDED WITHOUT THE ABILITY FOR

02:27:02.780 --> 02:27:04.182
FOR ENTITY.

02:27:04.248 --> 02:27:05.416
FOR A COMPANY OR BUSINESS TO BE

02:27:05.483 --> 02:27:08.886
ABLE. TO TO OVERCOME IN AND

02:27:08.953 --> 02:27:10.254
SPREAD TO SPREAD THE PAIN.

02:27:10.321 --> 02:27:11.422
IN OTHER WORDS --

02:27:11.489 --> 02:27:12.990
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING IS.

02:27:13.057 --> 02:27:14.759
IS THERE A RECOVERABLE AMOUNT OF

02:27:14.825 --> 02:27:16.460
MONEY THAT CAN BE MADE.

02:27:16.527 --> 02:27:19.564
WITH AN EXPECTATION THAT.

02:27:19.630 --> 02:27:21.098
THEY CAN CONTINUE TO THRIVE IN

02:27:21.165 --> 02:27:23.034
THIS INDUSTRY.

02:27:23.100 --> 02:27:24.735
IF IF THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:27:24.802 --> 02:27:26.070
INSURANCE DECIDED NO YOU'RE NOT

02:27:26.137 --> 02:27:27.471
GOING TO RECOVER.

02:27:27.538 --> 02:27:28.573
OR NOT AND IT'S HAPPENED MATTER

02:27:28.639 --> 02:27:29.674
FACT.

02:27:29.740 --> 02:27:32.610
THEY'VE BEEN REDUCED.

02:27:32.677 --> 02:27:34.378
AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE

02:27:34.445 --> 02:27:35.680
VERY CAREFUL WHEN WE START

02:27:35.746 --> 02:27:37.949
LOOKING AT MANDATES --

02:27:38.015 --> 02:27:39.917

02:27:40.785 --> 02:27:43.921
