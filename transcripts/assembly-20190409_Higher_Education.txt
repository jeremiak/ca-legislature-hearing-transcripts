CURRENT LAW THOUGH -- THE GOVERNING STANDARDIZED TESTING HINDER THE ACT FROM BEING OFFERED A SEVEN FOR SEVEN TH TEST DATE IN JULY WHEN STUDENTS HAVE THE BEST CHANCE. OF SUCCESS ON THE TEST -- AND SO -- THE THE IN IN ORDER OFFER HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS A SEVENTH TEST DATE CURRENT LAW WOULD REQUIRE A CITY TO RELEASE A FOURTH PRACTICE TEST TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE. THE TEST DEVELOPMENT CYCLE REQUIRED TO PRODUCE A FOURTH TEST. THAT WOULD TAKE ACT AS LONG AS TWO AND A HALF YEARS. YET IF THIS BILL BECOMES LAW THEY COULD START OFFERING THE ADDITIONAL SUMMER TEST TO STUDENTS NEXT YEAR FURTHERMORE.

SEVENTY THREE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AB ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE ESTABLISHES THE CENTER TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. THE MISSION OF THE CENTER IS TO ELIMINATE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT GAPS BETWEEN SUBGROUPS OF STUDENTS AND KEEP IN QUE THROUGH TWELVE IN GRADES K. THROUGH. TWELVE PROVIDING PRE SERVICE PREPARATION FOR EDUCATORS AND THIS YOU CSU SYSTEM FOR EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTIONAL SCHOOL LEADERSHIP. PRACTICES AND THE USE OF DATA. SERVING AS A RESOURCE FOR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES ON STRATEGIES FOR CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS INCLUDING. SERVING AS A CLEARING HOUSE FOR EVIDENCE BASED STRATEGIES AND PROMISING PRACTICING PRACTICES FOR CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP ACROSS OUR STATE. THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP IS A SIGNIFICANT AND PERSISTENT DISPARITY IN STUDENT PERFORMANCE AND EDUCATIONAL CHEAP ATTAINMENT BETWEEN STUDENTS SUBGROUPS IN CALIFORNIA. WE ALL KNOW CERTAIN GROUPS OF STUDENTS PERFORM BETTER THAN OTHERS AND THAT'S THE INTENT. OF THIS CENTER TO ESTABLISH IS BACK BEST PRACTICES AND BE ABLE TO TO SHARE DISSEMINATE THEM. ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO OTHERS MAY EMPLOY THEM. CURRENT LAW HAS ESTABLISHED A SYSTEM OF POLICY MAKING DATA. COLLECTION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND PRACTICE BUT THERE IS NO ENTITY TASK FOR SUPPORTING UNDERGRADUATE AND PRE SERVICE PREPARATION OF EDUCATOR PROGRAMS. AND ALTHOUGH THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP AS WIDE LEAD STUDIED NATIONALLY AND STATEWIDE. FEW SUPPORTS EXISTS TO COLLECT DISTILL AND DISTRIBUTE THE FINDINGS FROM THAT RESEARCH TO VOLUME POLICYMAKERS TECHNICAL SYSTEM PROVIDERS AND PRACTITIONERS. AB ELEVEN SEVENTY THREE WILL FILL THE RESEARCH AND PRE SERVICE VOID. IN THE EXISTING A CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM WORKING TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP BY ESTABLISHING A CENTER THAT'S A ONE STOP SHOP ONE PLACE. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL HOW HOW'S THE DATA AND AGAIN THE BEST PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AND WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT MAYBE IS -- JAMES LAND IT HAS. ON HIS PRESIDENT AND CEO OF EDUCATIONAL RESULTS PARTNERSHIP AND FORMER DIRECTOR. OF THE CENTER TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. MISTER CHAIR. AT PLEASE BEGIN GREAT -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THINK OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU VERY BRIEFLY. THIS IS A TOUGH. JOB. A TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP I SERVED AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER TEN YEARS AGO FOURTH FOR ITS LIFE FOR THE FOR THE THREE YEARS WE LEARNED A LOT. WE MOSTLY WE LEARNED THAT THIS IS A PERNICIOUS. THING. THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP EVEN DEFINING IT IS NOT FOR THE WITH THE THE LIGHT HEARTED IN THE WEEK -- IT'S LOADED WITH CONTROVERSY LOADED WITH BIAS. LOADED WITH OBSTACLES. EN EN BARRIERS AT EVERY TURN I WOULD [inaudible] SUGGEST. AND RECOMMEND HIGHLY THAT THE GOVERNANCE OF THIS ENTITY BE THOUGHT THROUGH [inaudible] VERY CAREFULLY. IT CANNOT BE STATUS QUO CANNOT BE BUSINESS AS USUAL. OUR GOVERNOR IT'S MODEL HAD THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AT THE TABLE WHO IS A FIFTY FIFTY VENTURE. AND EVENTUALLY THAT'S WHAT DID NOT WORK IN THE INSTITUTION CHANCER RE READ WAS NOT ABLE. TO GET THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN A DECISION MAKING [inaudible] ARM. WITH DECISION MAKING INFLUENCE WITHIN THE CENTER AND IT WE JUST BECAME. MORE OF A PROBLEM FOR HIM AT THAT TIME. WE DECIDED. TO TO NOT BE THE PROBLEM IN THE CENTER WAS CLOSED. ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS WE LEARNED ABOUT THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP WAS THAT IT'S NOT ONLY PREPARATION BARRIER BUT ITS INSTITUTIONAL BARRIERS EXIST. AT EVERY SEGMENT OF THE EDUCATION PIPELINE FROM. EARLY CHILDHOOD EARLY READING THE FIFTH GRADE MATH TO EIGHTH GRADE ALGEBRA. THE HIGH SCHOOL COURSE SEQUENCES TO GOING INTO COMMUNITY COLLEGE GRADUATING UNIVERSITY. ONLY ABOUT 35% OF THE COHORT OF NINTH GRADE STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA FROM THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND TEN IS. 65% OF THE COHORT FROM TWO THOUSAND TEN HAVE DISAPPEARED FROM OUR DATA MAPS. ONLY ABOUT 10% HAVE MADE IT THROUGH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AWARD OF THAT MAN'S GREAT COHORT IN ONLY 8% HAVE ACHIEVED A UNIVERSITY AWARD. 65% OF THOSE KIDS ARE OUR WORK FORCE TODAY AND WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE. THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP IS ALIVE AND WELL IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA IT REALLY DESERVES YOUR SUPPORT. I'M ON THE ON THE EFFORTS TO CLOSE IT I WOULD JUST REALLY THINK HARD ABOUT THE STRATEGIES ARE USED TO DO THAT. SO I APPRECIATE YOU LISTEN TO MY COMMENTS TODAY THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ANY WINNERS. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE -- THREE NINE I I DO HAVE A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR -- A LOT OF THE RESEARCH IN CALIFORNIA. IS USUALLY DONE. AT AT THE UC LEVEL. QUESTION TO YOU TO THE AUTHOR WHY. WHY DO YOU RECOMMEND IN THE BILL DID THIS -- AND TO DE BE ESTABLISHED IN THE CSU SYSTEM QUESTION FOR TWO REASONS -- RESEARCHERS IMPORTING IS IMPORTANT BUT IMPLEMENTING IT IS PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT. AND THE FACT THE MATTER IS THAT MOST OF THE CREDENTIALS THE TEACHING CREDENTIALS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COME OUT OF THE CSU SYSTEM. I THE OTHER SHOW HORSE AND THE WORK FORCE OF OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND AGAIN MOST OF THE TEACHER CANDIDATES COME COME OUT OF OUT OF THE CSU SYSTEM IN FACT JUST VERY FEW SCHOOLS. OF THE CSU SYSTEM SO -- I I THINK THIS ISSUE IS THE NATURAL PLACE IS A NATURAL FIT. FOR AN ENTITY OF THIS TYPE BECAUSE WE WANTED THOSE. ARE WE WANT TO TEACHER CREDENTIAL CANDIDATES TO HAVE. TO GAIN FROM -- THE RESEARCH DONE AT THE UC LEVEL AGAIN THIS ISN'T ABOUT RESEARCH IS ABOUT COLLECTING THE RESEARCH AND APPLYING IT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND IF YOU WOULD LEAVE IT TO THE CSU TO DETERMINE WHERE TO PLACE IT NO BUT I WOULD HOPE THEY WOULD THINK -- THE I HOPE THEY WOULD. TARGET SUCH A CENTER AND AN AREA THAT I PRODUCES A LOT OF TEACHER CREDENTIAL CANDIDATES. AND HAS THE CHALLENGES -- IT WITHIN ITS LOCAL COMMUNITY. THAT -- IT HAD IT WIRED THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP IS PRESENT LET ME BE BLUNT SO THEY CAN EMPLOYER OF THE VERY LOCAL LEVEL AND MAYBE SEND SOME THEIR TEACHER CREDENTIAL CANDIDATES. OUT TO LEARN FROM FROM AREA CLASSROOMS EMPLOYING THE TECHNIQUES. HOUSE TO WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION ITSELF. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE BY ASTRONOMICAL. WELL I VERY MUCH. SHARE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS GRAPPLED WITH FOR A LONG TIME. SO I COMMEND YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL FOR IT AND ALSO ASK YOU TO KEEP WORKING WITH COMMITTEE. ON SOME OF THE ANNOUNCES THAT THEY DID -- STATED IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE BILL ON PAGE THREE AND FOUR UNDERSTOOD. HI. AND WE STILL HAVE A ABSENCE OF A QUORUM. OKAY WILLOW WHEN ONCE WE HAVE A CORE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] AND WISH LIST ROOM. MR REVISION -- STRUCTURE. WILL GO TO FILE ITEM NINE MISTER CHIU. AB. EIGHT THIRTEEN FORTY I'M GONNA GRAB MY WITNESSES OKAY. IT'S A LITTLE CHAOTIC OUT THEIR LITTLE NOISY [inaudible] READY. WE HAVE SOME AS WE'RE LOOKING FOR OKAY RUN FILE ITEM NINE A. B.. THIRTEEN FORTY GREAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU COLLEAGUES APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB THIRTEEN FORTY TODAY. AND LET ME JUST FIRST START BY NOTING THAT THIS IS ONE BILL IN A PACKAGE OF SEVEN THAT ARE RESPONDING TO RECENT ACTIONS. BY PRESIDENT TRUMP AND EDUCATION SECRETARY DEVICE WHO ABANDON CRITICAL PROTECTIONS FOR STUDENTS STUDENTS VICTIMIZED PREPARATORY COLLEGES THAT HAVE PRIORITIZE PROFIT OVER STUDENTS. OUR BILL AB THIRTEEN FORTY WILL PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS FROM OVER PRICED INEFFECTIVE CAREER TRAINING PROGRAMS BY REINSTATING A STATE VERSION OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S FEDERAL GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT RULE. RECENTLY SCRAPPED BY TRUMP. THIS WAS A RULE THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED TO ADDRESS AN ALL TOO COMMON STORY. STUDENTS PROMISED BY RECRUITERS THAT THEY WILL FIND A JOB IN A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY. TO TAKE OUT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN DEBT IN ORDER TO ENROLL. ONLY TO FIND UPON GRADUATING THAT THEY CANNOT ACTUALLY GET THEIR PROMISE JOB. THEY'RE UNEMPLOYED OR UNDEREMPLOYED BUT STILL FACE ASTRONOMICAL DEBT REPAYMENTS OR EVEN LOAN DEFAULTS. THESE VICTIMS ARE OFTEN LOW INCOME AFRICAN AMERICAN VETERANS WERE WOMEN NATIONALLY MANY OF THEM ARE MAKING LESS THAN THE SEVEN DOLLAR AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE. THE FEDERAL GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT RULE APPLIES TO OR APPLY TO CAREER TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT TOOK ADVANTAGE OF FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID. UNDER THE RULE A PROGRAM AND I SHOULD SAY NOT AN ENTIRE SCHOOL BUT AN INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM. DIDN'T PASS MUSTER IF MORE THAN HALF OF ITS GRADUATES HAD EXCESSIVE STUDENT LOAN DEBT BURDENS WHEN WEIGHED AGAINST HER INCOMES AFTER COLLEGE. BASED ON INITIAL DATA FROM THE FEDERAL EDUCATION DEPARTMENT OVER -- TO FIFTY PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA DID NOT PASS THE TEST. THE SHODDY PROGRAMS GRADUATED. FIFTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO HAVE LEFT SCHOOL WITH OVER NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS CLOSE TO A BILLION DOLLARS IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT. AND A FORTUNE LAST YEAR. PRESIDENT TRUMP AND SECRETARY OF US MOVE TO SCRAP THIS RULE FUELING THE GROWTH OF PREDATORY SCHOOLS IN ABANDONING SAFEGUARDS THAT ARE PROTECTED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS. THIS BILL WOULD REINSTATE A VERSION OF THE GAME FOR PLANET ROLE AS EMBODIED IN FEDERAL LAW BEFORE TRUMP BECAME PRESIDENT. THIS BILL WOULD CAP THE ENROLLMENT OF PROGRAMS OF SOME -- AT THEIR PRIOR YEARS LEVELS AND PROHIBITS. WITH REGARDS TO OTHERS -- FOR THOSE PROGRAMS THAT FAIL ANY NEW ENROLLMENT. OUR STUDENTS DESERVE BETTER IN CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO PROTECT THEM IF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT. WITH THAT I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES. HI MY NAME IS THERESA SWEETS -- ON THE DAY I GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE. MY FELLOW STUDENTS AND I WERE LINED UP. IN A CORDONED OFF AREA UNDER THE PERFECT SANTA BARBARA STARR. WAITING TO ENTER THE THEATER IN COLLECTOR DIPLOMAS. MYSELF AND SEVERAL OTHER STUDENTS TURNED OUR HEADS TOWARD A COMMOTION NEAR THE ROPES AND I LOOKED OVER TO SEE MY DAD. BEING FOLLOWED BY AN EXASPERATED ADMINISTRATOR TELLING HIM HE HAD TO WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE CEREMONY TO SPEAK TO HIS GRADUATE. MY MOUNTING CONCERN TURNED TO LAUGHTER WHEN I SAW THAT. AND I REMEMBER MY MOM IT REMAINS AMONG A HANDFUL OF TIMES IN MY LIFE THAT I'VE EVER SEEN MY DAD CRY. WELL BROOKS THEN OWNED BY CC CAREER EDUCATION CORPORATION IS NO LONGER IN OPERATION. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF PREDATORY FOR PROFIT TRADE SCHOOL STILL OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA. I'M HERE TODAY TO SHARE MY STORY IN THE HOPES THAT I CAN READ THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME FROM HAPPENING TO THEM. I TENDED BROOKS IN SANTA BARBARA FROM JANUARY TWO TOUSAND THREE TO JUNE. TWO THOUSAND SIX GRADUATED WITH A BACHELOR OF ARTS AND PHOTOGRAPHY. ONCE A SOURCE OF PRIDE MY EDUCATION QUICKLY BECAME A ROOM A SOURCE OF STRESS BOTH PERSONAL AND FINANCIAL. WITH A COMBINED FEDERAL AND PRIVATE STUDENT THAT NOW TOTALING APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. SINCE GRADUATION I'VE NEVER HAD A JOB WHERE USE EDUCATION I RECEIVED AT BROOKS. AND I'VE NEVER HAD A JOB THAT'S PAYING ME EVEN. INCOME REMOTELY CLOSE TO WHAT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO BE PAY THOSE LOANS. I CAN'T FINANCE A CAR. MUCH LESS A HOME. AND IT IS UNLIKELY THAT I WOULD EVER BE ABLE TO START A FAMILY OR GET MARRIED BECAUSE I WOULD CONDEMN MY FAMILY TO A LIFETIME OF POVERTY. I CURRENTLY WORK AS A CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT A JOB THE INCIDENT WE DOESN'T EVEN REQUIRE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO FURTHER MY EDUCATION TO OBTAIN A NURSING DEGREE UNFORTUNATELY BROOKS LIKE SO MANY OTHER FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS. ACTIVELY MISLED STUDENTS OUT TO THE TRANSFERRED REALLY OF THE CREDITS THAT THEY EARNED WHILE IN ATTENDANCE. IN ADDITION THEY ALSO MADE SURE TO GUIDE STUDENT BORROWERS TO BAR THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FEDERAL. STUDENT LOAN DOLLARS ALLOWED IN PURSUIT OF A BACHELOR'S DEGREE MAKING ME AN ELIGIBLE FOR STUDENT LOANS AND FINANCIAL AID TO PURSUE NURSING. BROOKS USE UNETHICAL HIGH PRESSURE SALES TAX SUCH AS PAIN POINTS ABOUT ME BEING THE FIRST PERSON. IN MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY. TO GRADUATE COLLEGE. THEY RELIED ON THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NO ONE IN MY LIFE TO HELP ME ON TO THE RIGHT QUESTIONS. WE ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS. THEY MADE A POINT OF NEVER ANSWERING QUESTIONS VIA EMAIL ONLY OVER THE PHONE. NEW CREATED THE FALSE IMPRESSION. THAT THE ADMISSION PROCESS WAS COMPETITIVE WHEN IN FACT ALL THE REALLY CARED ABOUT WAS GETTING THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF STUDENTS ENROLLED IN SIGNING STUDENT LOAN DOCUMENTS. IN REALITY BROOKS OF MANY ADMITTED ANYONE WITH A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR GED AS LONG AS THEY WERE ABLE TO GET A STUDENT LOAN. ALTHOUGH I HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING THAT AT THE TIME AFTER I GRADUATED I FOUND OUT THAT THE ADMISSION COUNSELORS WERE JUST COMMISSION SALES PEOPLE. THEY WEREN'T PAID TO GIVE ME ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SCHOOL TO TELL ME HOW MUCH IT WOULD ACTUALLY COST ME OR TO COUNSEL ME ON WHETHER OR NOT THE SCHOOL WOULD HELP ME REACH MY GOALS. THEY WERE ONLY PAID TO GET ME TO ENROLL. AFTER GRADUATION CAREER SERVICES REGULARLY CONTACTED ME WITH FINANCIALLY MEANINGLESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNPAID JOBS TO BE FOUND ON THE LOCAL CRAIGSLIST PAGE. PERHAPS WORST OF ALL HIS MISSION COUNSELORS BLATANTLY LIED ABOUT THE EMPLOYMENT RATES OF STUDENTS AFTER GRADUATION AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE STUDENTS WERE MAKING. IN SHORT WELL I WORKED MULTIPLE JOBS TO STAY IN SCHOOL BROOKS MCC WERE HAPPILY RAKING IN PROFITS BY DEFRAUDING THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS AND NO ONE WAS STOPPING THEM. NO ONE WAS ALERTING THE PUBLIC OR PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS. NO ONE WAS THERE TO HELP ANY OF THIS RECOUP OUR FINANCIAL LOSSES TO SAY NOTHING OF THE DISASTROUS EFFECT THIS LEVEL OF DEBT HAS ON PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS. IF THIS SEEMS OUTRAGEOUS TO YOU GOOD. IT IS OUTRAGEOUS AND IT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF FORMER BURKE STUDENTS WHO'VE ALREADY FILED FOR BORROWERS DEFENSE TO REPAYMENT AND THAT NUMBER IS SURE TO GROW. WHILE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SITS ON THEIR HANDS DOING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL I HOPE THAT LEGISLATORS IN THE STATE I'VE CALLED MY HOME FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. WELL ONCE AGAIN LEAD THE WAY AND TO THE RIGHT [inaudible] THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BOB CHAIRMAN I AM A SENIOR FELLOW AT THE CENTURY FOUNDATION. I SERVED IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND WORKED ON SOME OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS NOW -- UNDERMINING THERE ARE UNFORTUNATELY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FORMER STUDENTS WHO AND SIMILAR SITUATIONS TO TO RECESS HAVE SIMILAR STORIES -- THIS IS A COMMON SENSE PROTECTION LEGISLATION IF THE BULK OF THE STUDENTS IN A MAJOR NOT A WHOLE SCHOOL BUT IN THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAMS YEAR AFTER YEAR. I HAVING TO TAKE ON MORE DEBT THAN IS REASONABLE FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO REPAIR A AS A GRADUATE THAT OF THAT INSTITUTION THE INSTITUTION EITHER NEXT TAKE NEEDS TO TAKE ACTION TO ADDRESS THAT. FOR STOP IN ROLLING CALIFORNIANS THAT SUB BASIC CONSUMER PROTECTION AGAINST EXCESSIVE DEBT GIVEN EARNINGS. I'M GONNA ADDRESS IF I LOOK THROUGH THE THE LETTERS FROM SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND AND OPPOSITION A MEDIC QUICKLY ADDRESS THE KEY ITEMS THAT I SAW IN THOSE LETTERS ONE IS. THE DATA WHERE DO WE GET THE DATA THERE IS STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR HAVING DEBT AND EARNINGS DATA AND IN FACT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WHILE THEY ARE. REPEALING THE REGULATIONS -- HAVE INDICATED SUPPORT FOR CONTINUING TO PROVIDE DEBT AND EARNINGS DATA SO THE THE BEST SOLUTION WILL BE THAT THE COLLEGES WORK WITH US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN GET THE DATA FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE BILL PROVIDES FOR A MATCHING DATA WITH THE STATE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT -- CONTRARY TO WHAT IS STATED IN ONE OR TWO OF THE LETTERS THIS IS NOT SAMPLE DATA THIS IS ACTUAL INDIVIDUAL -- IT DATA FROM THE STATE YOU WHY SYSTEM -- AND WOULD PROVIDE A GOOD REPLACEMENT IF THE FEDERAL DATA ARE ARE NOT AVAILABLE. A SECOND -- CRITICISM -- IN THE LETTERS WAS THAT LOANS THAT STUDENTS TAKE OUT FOR LIVING EXPENSES SHOULD NOT COUNT AGAINST THE SCHOOL. IN THE GAME FOR EMPLOYMENT ROLE THEY DON'T COUNT AGAINST THE SCHOOL AT ALL THE AMOUNT THAT COUNTS IS THE IS THE TUITION AND FEES THAT IS CHARGED BY THE INSTITUTION NOT THE LIVING EXPENSES SO THIS IS A MISUNDERSTANDING. ABOUT THE WAY THAT THE GAME FOR EMPLOY -- THE GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT RULE WORKS. THIRD -- THERE -- IF THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF COSMETOLOGY SCHOOLS COLLEGE COSMETOLOGY PROGRAMS THAT HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS BUT IN FACT -- THE PROPORTION OF ABOUT LESS THAN ONE OUT OF TEN COSMETOLOGY PROGRAMS -- FAILED THE LAST -- THE DATA THEY CAME OUT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- IN FROM GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT WHICH IS ABOUT THE SAME RATE AS OTHER KINDS OF CAREER PROGRAM SO THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ANY MAJOR PROBLEM IN COSMETOLOGY AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE WAGES THAT ARE NOT REPORTED. IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE CAUSING -- THEM -- TO FAIL THE MEASURES IT AT LARGE RATES AT THE SAME TIME TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY DO THERE ARE APPEALS PROCEDURES FOR THEM TO EIGHT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE -- ALTERNATIVES -- ALTERNATIVE EARNINGS INFORMATION -- AND LASTLY I WANTED TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT THE THE BUREAU ARE. STATE REGULATOR -- CAN'T HANDLE SOMETHING LIKE THIS -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THE BUREAU SORT OF LIKE THE DMV THERE'S OUT THERE A LICENSING AGENCIES THEY THEY THEY HAND OUT LICENSES. AND THEN FOLKS GO AND DO THINGS WITH THAT WAS DO THINGS AND DRIVING THEIR CARS OR WHATEVER SO WE HAVE IN THE IN THE DEEP IN THE BUREAU SITUATION PEOPLE THAN FILE COMPLAINTS AND THEY'RE SAYING. HEY THIS DRIVER OF THE SCHOOL WAS DRIVING A RADICALLY IN HURTING PEOPLE. BUT THEY GET THOSE COMPLAINTS AND WHAT DO THEY DO IT'S IT IS IT IS NOT AN EASY JOB IN THE CONTRARY SITUATION HERE IS THAT THE GAME FULL EMPLOYMENT ROLE IS LIKE AT LEAST LIKE HAVING A SENSOR IN THE CAR OUR THAT BEEPS. WHEN YOU HAVE DEBT LEVELS THAT ARE JUST TOO HIGH GIVEN THE EARNINGS SO IT SENDS A SIGNAL TO THE DRIVER AND IT IS INFORMATION THAT IS AVAILABLE TO THE AGENCY FOR ENFORCEMENT SO FROM AN ENFORCEMENT STANDPOINT? IT IS A LOT EASIER FOR THE BUREAU TO IN FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS THEN THE TASK THAT THE BUREAU HAS HAD AN ADMITTEDLY HAS FUMBLED IN A LOT OF WAYS BUT THIS IS A MUCH EASIER TASK BECAUSE IT INVOLVES. CLEAR MEASURES THAT GET REPORTED TO SCHOOLS THAT THEY HAVE TIME TO ADDRESS -- BEFORE THERE'S ANY RAMIFICATIONS ON THEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND BOB HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU.

MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GEORGE MILLER ON BEHALF OF ALLY UNIVERSITY WE'VE HAD VERY GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE IN THE SPONSORS REPRESENTATIVES AND I BELIEVE WE'VE. COME TO A MEETING AS REGARDS TO MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST. AND ENTITIES THAT. THE STATE IMPOSES POST GRADUATE INTERNSHIP REQUIREMENTS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND GETTING THAT DONE THANK YOU. SUPPORT OF THE BILL MR MILLER. YES RIGHT NOW WE ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMANDA BUT I BELIEVE WE'RE GETTING OUR MA'AM AND SO SAY NEUTRAL. ALL RIGHT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. AND IF WE COULD MAKE ROOM FOR THEM TO COME UP TO THE TABLE THANK YOU [inaudible] SINCE. THIS CHAIR REMEMBER SCOTT GOVERNOR ON BEHALF UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THE AUTHOR TO MEET. ALSO FOR EVEY TO MEET TO UNDERSTAND THEIR DATA SETS A LITTLE BETTER I THOUGHT IT WAS -- HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND THOSE. THAT SAID -- UNIVERSITY REMAINS OPPOSED TO THE BILL. WELL CERTAINLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ROLLED BACK IN FULL EMPLOYMENT. PHOENIX IS NOT CONVINCED THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO JUDGE INSTITUTIONS WE'VE MADE A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS OVER THE YEARS. SUCH AS DISQUALIFYING STUDENTS THAT OUR INSTITUTIONS THE BUYBACK BAGHDAD'S USING HIGH IN CASH MANAGEMENT. IN BOTH THOSE CASES THEY WERE IGNORED HAD THEY BEEN ADOPTED IN BOTH THOSE CASES ACTUALLY STUDENTS WOULD HAVE BEEN PROTECTED -- I'VE WORKED WITH THE BPP ITS SUCCESSOR AND ITS SUCCESSOR FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS -- WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE NEW LEADERSHIP. THERE IS NO PRACTICAL WAY THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DO WHAT IS STATED IN THE BILL THIS IS WHAT THE ANALYSIS FOR SIXTEEN ELEVEN SAID LAST YEAR. WE BELIEVE IT'S STILL TO BE THE CASE MY INSTITUTION IS GETTING COMPLAINTS FROM STUDENTS THAT ARE A YEAR OLD. TO THE EXTENT YOU IMPOSE THESE NEW OBLIGATIONS ON THE BUREAU IT'S SIMPLY GOING TO BE WORSE AND IT'S NOT A FEE FUNCTION ARE FEES ROSE TWO YEARS AGO. FROM FIFTY THOUSAND TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PER YEAR WE ARE PAYING OUR FAIR SHARE IT IS SIMPLY LACKING A CLEAR MISSION. WHICH THE HISTORICAL ISSUE IN MY OPINION WITH THE BUREAU. SO RATHER THAN TRYING TO RECREATE THE FEDERAL SYSTEM LET'S LOOK AWAY AS THE STATE CAN DO THIS AND A SIMPLER FASHION TO ADDRESS BAD ACTORS WHICH WE HAVE A SHARED INTEREST ELIMINATE. THESE REASONS WE REMAIN OPPOSED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS RICK WOULD AND THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA FOR APPROXIMATELY THIRTY THREE YEARS -- WE EMPLOY TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY PEOPLE. AND RETRAIN APPROXIMATELY TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS -- EACH CALENDAR YEAR I'M HERE TO OPPOSE A. B.. THIRTEEN FORTY ON BEHALF OF THOSE EMPLOYEES STUDENTS AND MEMBERS SCHOOLS OF OUR STATE ASSOCIATION CAPS. I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE MERITS OF THE REGULATION. IN PARTICULAR TODAY DURING THE TIME THAT WE HAVE HAVE EXCUSE ME. THIS BILL IS INHERENTLY FLAWED BECAUSE THE FEDERAL MODEL IT'S BASED ON WAS FLAWED IN ITS AND SEVENTY THE FEDERAL MODEL IS FLAWED BECAUSE IT DENIES THE STUDENT THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE A COURSE OF STUDY. BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MEET AN ARBITRARY METRIC IMPOSED ON THAT PROGRAM. THE FEDERAL MODEL IS ALSO FLAWED BECAUSE IT ASSUMED WRONGLY THAT WAGE DATA WAS STATIC. ACROSS STATES COUNTIES AND IN CITIES AND IT IS NOT. FOR EXAMPLE SOMEONE LIVING IN FRESNO COUNTY WHERE I LIVE IS GOING TO MAKE MUCH LESS MONEY AS A MEDICAL ASSISTANT AND THEY WILL MAKE IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND YET THE SAME METRIC IS APPLIED EQUALLY IN EACH OF THOSE REGIONS. BECAUSE THE CALIFORNIA MODEL IS BASED ON THIS FEDERAL MODEL IT TOO WOULD BE FLAWED ANDERSON SEVENTY BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE REGIONAL WAGE DIFFERENCES. LIKE THE FEDERAL MODEL THE STATE MODEL ALSO DOES NOT ADDRESS UNDER REPORTED WAGES FOR VOCATIONS LIKE COSMETOLOGY. THOSE IN FAVOR THE BILL MENTIONED THAT NOT TOO MANY SCHOOLS WERE SUBJECT -- TO PENALTIES BECAUSE A GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT THAT OFFERED COSMETOLOGY HOWEVER THE COURTS FELT DIFFERENTLY AND MADE CHANGES TO THE RULE TO EXEMPT THEM FROM. LIKE FEDERAL MODEL THERE IS NO DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN THE WAGES THAT ARE EARNED BY THEY GRADUATED STUDENT AND REPORTED AND THE PROGRAM OF STUDY. TAKEN AND IN NO WAY AND THERE IS NO WAY TO CONNECT THOSE TWO THINGS. OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE'VE OBSERVED AMONGST OUR STUDENTS IS THAT OFTEN THEY WORK IN A JOB THAT WAS RELATED TO THEIR TRAINING AT ALL. AND THOSE ARE THE WAGES THAT WERE USED TO MAKE THE ASSESSMENT OF THE PROGRAM OF STUDY. AND THERE IS CURRENTLY NO REAL WAY TO CONNECT THE TYPE OF WAYS THEY AREN'T AS TO WHETHER IT'S RELATED TO THE TRAINING OR NOT. AND THE ACTUAL TRAINING THAT TOOK PLACE. AS WELL IDENTIFIED. BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S -- HERE IN THE CAPITAL THIS BILL CONTAINS PENALTIES THAT ARE QUOTES SAID STANTON BILLY MORE STRINGENT THAN THOSE IN THE FEDERAL MODEL. THERE IS NO APPEAL PROCESS AND CURRENTLY IN THE BILL. AND SCHOOLS THAT ARE FOUND OUT OF COMPLIANCE WOULD HAVE NO RECOURSE TO CORRECT -- NONCOMPLIANCE. AND FINALLY ALONG SIDE. NINETY TEN OR OTHER RECENTLY PROPOSED STATE -- EIGHTY FIVE FIFTEEN BILLS AN INSTITUTION'S ABILITY TO COMPLY SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH BOTH OF THOSE METRICS WOULD BE. IN REALITY OUT OF REACH FOR THOSE INSTITUTIONS I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. AND BEFORE I CALL ON OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION I'M GONNA ASK. THAT WE ESTABLISH A A QUORUM. p[inaudible] GLORIA [inaudible] BLOOM. GABRIEL -- WHEN [inaudible] KILEY [inaudible] GONZALEZ [inaudible] LOW [inaudible] PATTERSON. SANTIAGO WEBER.

OUR SCHOOLS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COUNT THAT DATA TOWARDS THE FORMULA THERE ARE PROFESSIONS LIKE COSMETOLOGY FILM OTHERS IN THE ARTS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY TRADITIONAL W. TWO EMPLOYEES. THAT DATA WILL NOT BE ACCURATE THEREFOREOUR PROGRAMS WERE FAIL SO AGAIN THE DETAILS MATTER AND THE FEDERAL LAW WAS CHALLENGED IN COURT AND THOSE WHO CHALLENGED IT PREVAIL.

SEE NO OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ANY WITNESSES WHO WORKED WIENER [inaudible] SEEING NONE. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] I IF MOVE BY MR LOW SECOND BY MS LOAD AND GONZALEZ FLETCHER -- I DO HAVE A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR FIRST OF TO THE AUTHOR YOU DO AGREE TO THE MEASUREMENTS ON PAID ABSOLUTE I WAS ACTUALLY ABOUT TO SAY JUST THAT. THANK YOU AND THEN -- QUESTION ANOTHER QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. IT IN WHAT IN WHAT WAYS. ARE. FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS BENEFITING BY NOT BEING. BY THE X. BY AND NOT HAVING A GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT -- BEING PART OF THE LAW. BY NOT HAVING BREAK EPISODE LE LET ME SAY A FEW THINGS FIRST OF ALL VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION THIS COMMITTEE. THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT DEMONIZING ALL FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS IN FACT THE VAST MAJORITY OF FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS ARE PASSING THIS TEST. 80% OF THE MORE BUT 20% OF THEM ARE NOT AND BY MARKETING THE POTENTIAL FUTURES FOR THE STUDENTS. AND ALLOWING THEM TO ANCHOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF DEBT. THAT THEN LEAD TO THEM NOT BEING ABLE TO SUCCEED IN THE WORKPLACE THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO TARGET HERE -- AND SO. REALLY WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT THE FEDERAL STANDARD THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE BEFORE PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ELECTED AND BEFORE HE AND HIS EDUCATION SECRETARY DECIDED TO DISBAND THIS ROLE. WE JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO WHAT THE FEDERAL STANDARD WAS WHICH SHOWED THAT UNDER THAT RULE THERE WERE OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SCHOOLS. OVER FIFTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS LIKE TO RESA WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED BY THIS PROGRAM WE'RE SIMPLY TRYING. TO ESTABLISH A STANDARD. SO. I THINK NOT HAVING THIS ROLE WILL MEAN THAT THOSE 20% OF SCHOOLS THOSE FIFTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS AND FUTURE STUDENTS. WILL NOT HAVE AN ABILITY TO KNOW AS MISTER SHERMAN SAID IF THERE SCHOOL -- IS NOT GONNA PROVIDE THEM THE EDUCATION THAT THEY ARE BEING TOLD. BY RECRUITERS AND MARKETING MATERIALS THAT THEY'RE GONNA GET. THANK YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I HAVE A QUESTION. CHAIR. ST STE CHOI [inaudible] YOUR CHAIR. I CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF YOUR BILL -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STUDENTS WOULD HAVE A YOU KNOW FULL OWNING POWER WHEN THEY GRADUATE THE FROM. BUT I THINK IT HAS -- BEEN OUT OF CONCERN NOT TO MEDIA -- NOT FEATHER STANDARD I HAVEN'T SEEN IT UP BUT THE THE SEAT OF POWER EACH PROGRAM EACH OCCUPATIONAL CATEGORY HAS A WALKABLE OWNING. SALARY POWER WOULD THAT BE AND THE ONLY THOSE PROGRAMS ARE OFFERED -- BY THE PROFIT COLLEGES. ARE SO THAT MEANS TO YOUR BILL WOULD NOT ALLOW THEM THAT. OR NOT THE MEET THEIR EARNING POWER. SO STARTUP EARNING POWER ANY POTENTIAL IT'S ACTUALLY WHAT THEY ARE LEARNING AS FAR AS INCOME WHICH IS DATA THAT WE CAN TRACK. SO OUR EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT CAN TRACK THAT DATA THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TRACK THAT DATED THIS DATA IS ITS DATA IT'S FONG SALARY CORRECT IT'S NOT BASED ON A FUTURE SENSE OF WHAT YOU MIGHT MAKE. IT'S BASED ON WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY EARNING ONCE YOU'VE GRADUATED FROM THE SCHOOL AND I SHOULD SAY THIS IS DATA THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN COLLECTING. I AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS ROLLING BACK THE RULE AT THIS TIME THEY HAVE ACTUALLY PRESIDENT TRUMP PUT OUT AN EXECUTIVE ORDER. REQUIRING HIS US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO ALLOW FOR PROGRAM LEVEL DATA AROUND STUDENT EARNINGS AND STUDENT DEBT TO CONTINUES OUR HOPE IS THE FEDERAL DATE IS GOING TO CONTINUE AND CONTINUE TO BE THE STANDARD. BUT THIS BILL ALSO HAS AS A BACK UP -- AND ABILITY FOR US TO CONTINUE TO COLLECT THIS DATA THROUGH STATE AGENCIES SO THAT WE CAN. CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT THE ROLE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT AGAIN IT'S NOT ABOUT FUTURE EARNINGS ARE ANY PROJECTION OF WHAT SOMEONE MIGHT MAKE IT'S ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY EARNING WHAT THE ACTUAL INCOME AS THOSE. CERTAIN OCCUPATION OR PROGRAMS SO IF THE CURRENT LAW SALARY IS -- FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SO ON GOING CURRENT LAW. IN BEGINNING SALARY THAN -- WHAT -- TUITION AMOUNT TO WOULD BE ALLOWED THESE THAT THE TUITION CONTROLLER OR NOT TO ALLOW THE PROGRAM ITSELF SO THERE'S AS VERY SPECIFIC STANDARD THAT'S THAT ESSENTIALLY SAYS YOU FAIL OR YOU'RE PASSING THE TEST IF. YOU'RE ANNUAL LOAN REPAYMENT FOR A GRADUATE IS BELOW 20% OF YOUR DISCRETIONARY INCOME OR 8% OF YOUR TOTAL EARNINGS SO THAT'S THE STANDARD. THAT WAS ESTABLISHED. IN LAW AND WHAT I WILL SAY IS WHEN IT WAS ESTABLISHED IN LAWS SOME YEARS BACK THERE ARE MANY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WHO THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS ACTUALLY TOO LOW A STANDARD THAT THAT -- IT SHOULD BE REYES BUT THAT WAS A STANDARD THAT WAS AGREED UPON AND EVEN UNDER THAT LOW STANDARD WE STILL HAVE. AGAIN -- 250- PROGRAMS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE RECENTLY FAILED THAT TEST THIS INTENDED CONTROL THOUGH TWEE SHOWN AMOUNT THAT BEING CHARGED. NO THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THIS BILL TO CONTROLS A TUITION OUT AGAIN THE POINT OF THIS IS IF YOU ARE A STUDENT. AND YOU'LL TOLD YOU GO TO THIS PARTICULAR KERR TRAINING PROGRAM. YOUR SALARY WHEN YOU GRADUATE IS GOING TO BE MUCH HIGHER THAN WHATEVER YOU'RE MAKING NOW. AND SO YOU IN KERR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF DEBT. AND WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAID UNTIL THIS RULE WAS WAS WAS WAS IN THE PROCESS BEEN ROLLED BACK IS. THOSE STUDENTS HAVE NOT SEEN THEIR INCOMES RISE IN FACT MANY OF THOSE STUDENTS ARE BARELY EARNING THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE. AND SO IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IF YOU'VE IN COURT AN AWFUL LOT OF DEBT. AND YOU'RE NOT SENIOR INCOME RISE. THAT DEGREE PROGRAM IS NOT HELPING YOU AND WE'RE TRYING TO IDENTIFY AGAIN THOSE PROGRAMS. WHICH IN CALIFORNIA RECENT WAS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PROGRAMS ABOUT PROGRAMS -- IN THE FOR PROFIT. WORLD THOSE ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE FAILING OUR STUDENTS AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO IDENTIFY. WHY ARE YOU LIMITING WANTED TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS? THERE IS ALREADY DATA THAT GETS COLLECTED FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE AND WE'RE SIMPLY TRYING TO MATCH THAT FOR THE PROPER FOR PROFIT SECTOR SO  HAVE NO PROBLEM APPLYING THIS TO ALL SCHOOLS. IN FACT -- IF OTHERS WANT TO COMMENT ON THIS I THINK THIS IS A STANDARD THAT SHOULD APPLY TO ALL SCHOOLS BUT WE ALSO WANTED TO APPLY TO A SECTOR THAT HAS NOT SEEN PUBLIC SCHOOLS CURRENTLY -- FOLLOW YOUR REGULATIONS THAT SO -- SO YES -- THE UC SYSTEM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- CSU SYSTEM THEY ARE AT THAT EDT ACTUALLY COORDINATES WITH THOSE EDUCATION SECTORS TO GET SIMILAR DATA. SO THAT THIS ONE HAS ALSO BRINGS UP A LOT OF POTENTIAL. FOR PROFIT LOSS OF LOS WITH SO FOR THOSE OF GRADUATE SO WHEN THEY THIS IN ALL DON'T FIND A JOB WITHOUT WANTED OUT. BE ABLE TO LAW. PAY THEIR DEBTS I WOULD SAY AS A LAWYER IF THERE ARE CERTAIN LAW SCHOOLS THAT ARE CAUSING STUDENTS JUNK FOR SIX FIGURES OF DEBTS. AND THOSE LAWYERS ARE UNABLE TO BE EMPLOYED AND THERE'S A VERY REGULAR AND CONSISTENT RECORD OF THAT I THINK WE DO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE STUDENTS. I HAVE SOME -- JUST FACE IT DOUBLE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS DO TRACK THESE THESE KIND OF DATA MATCHING THEIR GRADUATES INFORMATION WITH THE STATE ET DE BECAUSE THEY ARE PUBLICLY. GOVERNED AND DON'T HAVE THE SAME INCENTIVES AS FOR PROFITS WE TEND TO NOT HAVE THE SAME KINDS OF PROBLEMS THERE -- AND SO THERE ARE THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENT REGULATIONS THAT APPLY ON THE PRIVATE FOR PROFIT SIDE BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE SEE THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE AS A RESULT OF THEIR CONTROL BEING IN THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE. WHO ARE ABLE TO POCKET ANY MONEY THAT'S NOT SPENT ON THE EDUCATION SO -- THIS APPROACH HELPS TO ENCOURAGE THE SCHOOLS TO SPEND ON THE EDUCATION SO THAT STUDENTS WILL HAVE THE EARNING POWER COMING OUT TO ACTUALLY REPAY. THE LOAN -- OR ADJUST THEIR PRICING IF IN FACT THAT'S WHAT'S DRIVING THE HIGH AMOUNTS OF DEBT IF IT'S NOT A REASONABLE AMOUNT. BUT IT'S UP TO THE TEN IT'S UP TO THE SCHOOLS HOW THEY WANT TO RESPOND. WOULD WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. AGAIN A VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION -- LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS BUT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT MAKING SURE WE'RE PUTTING OUR STUDENTS FIRST AND NOT THE SHAREHOLDERS OF CERTAIN FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS AND WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. I I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING THE BILL. THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE AUTHOR TOOK ON PAGE SIX OF THE ANALYSIS WILL BE PROCESS IN THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS -- COMMITTEE. GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT IS AN IMPORTANT WAY TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS EFFECTIVENESS OF CAREER PREPARATION PROGRAMS I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY AND KNOW THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE. TO WORK ON CRAFTING AN APPROPRIATE DATA A PALETTE PROCESS MOVING FORWARD. SO WE HAD A MOTION BY. MISTER LOWE AND SECOND BY THIS GONZALES FLETCHER MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE BUSIESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE MEDINA HI MEDINA I CHOI. CHOI NOT VOTING GLORIA. GLORIA I BLOOM. GABRIEL -- WHEN -- WHEN I? GONZALEZ I LOW. LOW I PATTERSON SANTIAGO WEBER. FIVE ZERO WILL LEAVE THE BILL ON CALL FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU. NEXT ST -- SIGN IN ORDER MR BERMAN -- FILE ITEM. WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN WITH FILE ITEM. ONE FIVE TWO ONE I'M NOT SURE WHICH FALLS. ITEM THAT IS. IS FILE ITEM ONE PERFECT. ONCE A MONTH. FILE ITEM ONE MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF BREAK FROM PRIVATE FOR PROFIT COLLEGES. AB FIVE TWENTY ONE WOULD TASK THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FIREARM VIOLENCE RESEARCH CENTER WITH RESEARCHING DEVELOPING IMPLEMENTING AND EVALUATING EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR HEALTH PROVIDERS. ARE PREVENTING FIREARM RELATED HARLEM. CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCES UNACCEPTABLY HIGH RATES OF FIREARM RELATED DEATH AND INJURY. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION REPORTED THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR FIREARM. RELATED DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING SIXTEEN HUNDRED TEN SUICIDES AND FOURTEEN HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE HOMICIDES. FURTHERMORE MASS SHOOTINGS ARE CHANGING THE CHARACTER OF PUBLIC LIFE IN THE STATE. JUST LAST NOVEMBER A MASS SHOOTING AT BORDERLINE BAR AND GRILL IN THOUSAND OAKS CALIFORNIA RESULT IN TWELVE DEATH. GUN VIOLENCE NOT ONLY A SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AND PUBLIC HEALTH BUT IS EXTREMELY COSTLY AS WELL. IN TWO THOUSAND TEN THE ESTIMATED COST OF HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT CARE FOR FARM RELATED INJURIES IN CALIFORNIA WAS ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS WITH MEDI CAL AND OTHER GOVERNMENT PAYERS RESPONSIBLE 464% OF THOSE COSTS. WELL WE WHILE WE RELY ON HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO SAVE LIVES AFTER GOING VIOLENCE WE SHOULD ALSO KNOWLEDGE THEIR UNIQUE ABILITY TO HELP PREVENT THESE TRAGEDIES IN THE FIRST PLACE. TRANSAMERICAN SKIPS INSERTED A MOTION AND SECOND. LAST YEAR THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS PUBLISHED A POSITION PAPER ON REDUCING FARM INJURIES AND DEATHS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE RECOMMENDS A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TO FIREARMS RELATED VIOLENCE IN THE PREVENTION OF FIREARM INJURIES AND DEATHS AND ENCOURAGES PHYSICIANS TO DISCUSS WITH THEIR PATIENTS. THE RISKS THAT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING A FARM IN THE HOME AND RECOMMEND WAYS TO MITIGATE SUCH RISKS. WHILE MANY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS RECOGNIZE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP PREVENT FARM RELATED INJURY AND DEATH MANY CITE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE REGARDING WHEN AND HOW TO COUNSEL PATIENTS AS A PRINCIPAL BARRIER TO ACTION. AB FIVE TWENTY ONE RECOGNIZES THAT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO HELP PREVENT FARM RELATED HARM AND AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FIREARM VIOLENCE RESEARCH CENTER IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED. TO EQUIP THEM WITH THE EDUCATION TRAINING AND RESOURCES NEEDED TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS AT RISK FOR SUCH HARM PROVIDE EVIDENCE BASED COUNSELING TO MITIGATE RISK AND INTERVENE IN SITUATIONS OF IMMINENT DANGER. IMPORTANTLY THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO TAKE THIS TRAINING WITH ME TODAY ARE DOCTOR GARREN WITH A MOOT. THE DIRECTOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FIREARM VIOLENCE RESEARCH CENTER I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE THE COMMUNITY INTO HAVING. OF MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANKS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY ALL BE A BRIEF AS WELL -- I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE ESTABLISHED -- FIRST IN THE NATION PUBLICLY FUNDED FIREARM VIOLENCE RESEARCH CENTER I'M ALSO A PRACTICING EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN AT UC DAVIS MEDICAL CENTER DOWN THE STREET. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN HAS. I THINK VERY AMPLY QUANTIFIED. WE FACE A CRISIS OF FIREARM RELATED DEATHS AND INJURY IN CALIFORNIA AS WE DO AROUND THE COUNTRY. THERE IS A NEW MOBILIZATION TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS. IN PARTICULAR A REAL SURGE OF INTEREST AMONG AMONG A HEALTH PROFESSIONALS PHYSICIANS NURSES MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS SOCIAL WORKERS. A RECOGNITION THAT MANY OF OUR PATIENTS ARE AT RISK THAT THE FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT RISK CAN BE IDENTIFIED IN MORE THAN THAT THEY MAY BE THE VERY REASONS WHY WE ARE SEEING THE PATIENT. ALL OF WHICH CREATES WHAT WE CALL A TEACHABLE MOMENT A PHRASE THAT I THINK IS FAMILIAR TO ALL OF US IT'S A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH A PATIENT. AND CHANGE THAT PATIENTS BEHAVIOR IN WAYS THAT WILL BENEFIT THEM THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. BUT I SHOULD MENTION THAT THIS SURGE OF INTEREST -- IS NOT JUST ON THE PART OF THE PROFESSIONAL COMMUNITY THE RESEARCH CENTER HAS JUST COMPLETED THE FIRST SURVEY OF FIREARM OWNERSHIP AND USE IN CALIFORNIA IN THE LAST FORTY YEARS. WE ASKED ABOUT OPINIONS ABOUT SOME OF THE WAYS IN WHICH VIOLENCE MIGHT BE PREVENTED OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC. AND WE LEARNED THAT MORE THAN CALIFORNIA SUPPORTS CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND PATIENTS ABOUT FIREARM INJURY MORE THAN 80% OF CALIFORNIA FIREARM OWNERS SUPPORT THOSE CONVERSATIONS. WHEN THERE IS AN INDICATION OF RISK WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT? TO GIVE YOU A SENSE I THINK I THINK THAT THE DETAILS OF WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING TO DO ARE LAID OUT IN THE DOCUMENTS I WOULD BE. HAPPY TO HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS IF APPROPRIATE -- CLOSE BY GIVING YOU A SENSE OF THE SCOPE OF THE INITIATIVE WE ARE UNDERTAKING YOU'RE PROPOSING TO UNDERTAKE. CALIFORNIA HAS NEARLY FIFTY THOUSAND PHYSICIANS IN PRIMARY CARE SPECIALTIES FAMILY MEDICINE INTERNAL MEDICINE PEDIATRICS SIX THOUSAND EMERGENCY MEDICINE PHYSICIANS LIKE ME SEVEN THOUSAND PSYCHIATRISTS ALL OF WHOM. MAY HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY IN THIS WE ALSO HAVE SOMEWHERE NORTH OF FOUR MILLION FIREARM OWNERS IN THE IN THE STATE IT WOULD TAKE A LABOR FORCE OF THE THE SIZE I AM I AM HINTING AT TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH SUFFICIENT FREQUENCY. HELP IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ANY WINNERS. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. WE HAD A MOTION -- BUT BEFORE THAT I JUST ONE IS THANK THE AUTHOR -- FOR BRING THE BILL FORWARD. AND AND I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS TRAINING COULD LEAD -- COULD LEAD TO INTERVENTIONS THAT WOULD PREVENT. MORE FIREARM RELATED TRAGEDIES THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE STATE. SO WE HAVE A MOTION BY. MISTER GLORIA IS SECOND BY MISS MISTER LOWE. AND MA'AM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. MEDINA MEDINA I CHOI. CHOICE I GLORIA. GLORIA I BLOOM. GABRIEL -- WHEN -- WHEN I KILEY GONZALEZ? GONZALEZ ALL RIGHT LOW. LOW I PATTERSON SANTIAGO WEBER. SIX ZERO WILL LEAVE THE BILL OPEN THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THEN IF YOU'D LIKE TO PRESENT -- FILE ITEM. TEN LOVE. TO THIS PAST WEEKEND. GOOD GOD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FILE ITEM. TEN AB. THIRTEEN FORTY ONE THANK YOU COLLEAGUES AND MISTER CHAIR. AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ADVOCATES RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT STUDENTS CALIFORNIA'S ROLE BECOMES EVEN MORE CRITICAL. AB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE WILL PREVENT COVERT FOR PROFIT COLLEGES FROM EVADING STATE OVERSIGHT BY REQUIRING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN INSTITUTION THAT CLAIMS TO BE A NONPROFIT COLLEGE OR A PUBLIC COLLEGE. ACTUALLY MEETS THE DEFINITION OF A NONPROFIT CORPORATION OR PUBLIC INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION. THESE COVERT FOR PROFIT COLLEGES ARE STARTING TO USE A NON PROFIT OR PUBLIC LABEL MISLEADING STUDENTS WHILE THE SAME TIME DODGING APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT. THESE FOR PROFIT COLLEGES ARE TRYING TO GAME THE SYSTEM. THE DECLINE IN ENFORCEMENT OF NONPROFIT STATUS BY THE FEDERAL INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICES ALLOWING SOME FOR PROFIT COLLEGES. TO GET AWAY WITH USING COMPLICATED FINACIAL SCHEMES AND SHELL CORPORATIONS TO LAY CLAIM TO NONPROFIT STATUS. THIS EMERGING PROBLEM IS ALREADY AFFECTING CALIFORNIA STUDENTS FOR EXAMPLE GRAND CANYON EDUCATION INCORPORATED IS A FOR PROFIT COMPANY TRADED ON NASDAQ. THEY CREATED A GRAND CANYON UNIVERSITY AND CLAIM IT IS A NONPROFIT COLLEGE. HOWEVER THE PRESIDENT OF THE NONPROFIT GRAND CANYON UNIVERSITY IS ALSO THE C. E. O. OF THE FOR PROFIT GRAND CANYON EDUCATION INCORPORATED. AND ABOUT 60% OF THE TUITION REVENUE THAT THE NONPROFIT COLLEGE RECEIVED FLOWS THROUGH THE FOR PROFIT COMPANY. AS GEORGETOWN LAW PROFESSOR IN NONPROFIT LAW EXPERT BRIAN GALLEY SAID THE NONPROFIT IS ESSENTIALLY A TRUSTWORTHY LOOKING WRAPPER AROUND A FOR PROFIT BUSINESS. THE ARRANGEMENT MAKES A MOCKERY OF THE CONCEPT OF A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION. WITHOUT ENFORCEMENT OR OVERSIGHT THESE COVERT FOR PROFIT COLLEGES WILL CONTINUE TO MISLEAD STUDENTS AND AVOID APPROPRIATE STATE OVERSIGHT. IN FACT ASHFORD UNIVERSITY OWNED BY BRIDGE POINT EDUCATION INCORPORATED HAS ALREADY STATED THAT IT WOULD FOLLOW GRAND CANYON UNIVERSITY'S LEAD AND CLAIM NONPROFIT STATUS. UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA CANNOT RELY ON THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. DESPITE THE POOR RECORD OF SOME FEDERALLY FUNDED FOR PROFIT COLLEGES AND SCANDALS THAT HAVE PLAGUED THE FOR PROFIT INDUSTRY. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REFUSES TO ADMIT THAT INVESTOR CONTROL OF COLLEGES IS DETRIMENTAL TO STUDENTS AND TAXPAYERS. THEREFORE CALIFORNIA MUST STEP UP AND STEP IN TO PROTECT OUR STUDENTS AND ENSURE THAT APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT REMAINS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE IN WITH ME TO TEST FIRE BOB SHERMAN IN ERIC DEAN. MISTER CHAIRMAN BOB CHAIRMAN FROM THE CENTURY FOUNDATION -- WE'VE STUDIED THIS ISSUE OF FOR PROFIT COLLEGES -- CAN CLAIMING TO CONVERT TO NON PROFIT AND HAVE FOUND THAT IN MANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHAT THEY'VE REALLY DONE IS SET UP A SHELL CORPORATION AND PRETENDED TO BE NONPROFIT BECAUSE THE IRS IS NO LONGER REALLY ENFORCING OVERSIGHT OF GENUINE NONPROFIT STATUS. THE NONPROFIT NO WHEN YOU LOOK AT FRAUD COMPLAINTS FROM STUDENTS WHO TEXTED LOANS MOST STUDENT LOANS ARE ARE GO TO STUDENTS AT NONPROFIT AND PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES BUTTON ALMOST 99% OF THE FRAUD COMPLAINTS INVOLVING FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS. ARE FROM FOR PROFIT COLLEGES THAT'S BECAUSE THE PUBLIC AND NONPROFIT CONTROL OF COLLEGES MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF CONSUMER PROTECTION IT HAS BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE AND IT IS WHY THERE IS A GOOD REPUTATION GENERALLY. FOR PUBLIC AND NONPROFIT HIGHER EDUCATION. THE FOR PROFITS WANT TO GRAB ON TO THAT REPUTATION AND SELL THEIR COLLEGE BASED ON THAT REPUTATION WELL NOT ACTUALLY APPLYING TO THEMSELVES THE RULES THAT SEPARATE THE MONEY MAKING FROM THE CONTROL. OF THE COLLEGE THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH FOR CALIFORNIA PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT FOR COLLEGES CALLING ITSELF NONPROFIT OR PUBLIC THAT ACTUALLY OPERATES THAT WAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR -- MY NAME IS ACTING I'M ACTUALLY SENDING A RESIDENT AND A FORMER ASHFORD UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEE AND NAVY VETERAN MYSELF AND I WAS A MILITARY OR ENROLLMENT SERVICES ADVISOR AT ASHFORD. FOR A TWO AND A HALF YEARS FROM JUNE TWENTY FIFTEEN TO DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN I WAS ABLE TO SEE FIRST HAND HOW IT WORKS THERE WITHIN THE FIRST THREE WEEKS. I LEARNED THAT I WAS BEING TRAINED TO BE A SALES PERSON. I WASN'T THERE TO ADVISE I WASN'T THERE -- TO BRING STUDENTS INTO THE WORLD OF HIGHER EDUCATION IT WAS THERE. TO SELL. AND I WANT TO SPEAK FROM THAT EXPERIENCE OF CALLING COLD CALLING TWO HUNDRED UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE A DAY. AND MOST THE PEOPLE I SPOKE TO WAR OF THE WORLDS FROM LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES IN THE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. AND THAT WILL OUR SHARES WERE BEING SOLD ON THE STOCK MARKET. AND THAT'S NOT OKAY TO ME AS A FORMER EMPLOYEE WHEN I HAD TO SIT THERE AND CALL PEOPLE. EVERY SINGLE DAY AND BECOME THEIR FRIEND AND ROLL THEM AND WATCH THEM RACK UP STUDENT THAT AND I WOULDN'T CARE BECAUSE I WAS ALREADY ON TO THE NEXT MONTH NUMBERS THAT I HAD HIT. I WAS ON THE PHONE FOR FOUR HOURS A DAY AND MY JOB WAS TO TELL A MARKET EDUCATION. AND BECAUSE WE HAD BPI SHARES. TO LINE UP PUT THE SHAREHOLDER POCKETS AND WHEN WE WENT THROUGH THAT IT WAS X. IT A CREATE A COMPETITIVE SALES ENVIRONMENT SO WE WOULD DO COMPETITIONS ON THE FLOOR THAT THE OF THE COLLEGE IF YOU WELL. AND WE WOULD. BE GIVEN FLAGS OF WE GOT MORE TO ENROLL OR OR PRESENT PRICES LIKE -- YOU KNOW SHOUT OUTS FROM YOUR DIRECTOR AND IF WE WEREN'T HITTING OUR NUMBERS WERE BROUGHT INTO A CONFERENCE ROOM AND PUBLICLY SHAMED IN FRONT OF OUR PEERS. THIS IS HOW ASHFORD UNIVERSITY IS RUN AND WHILE I WAS THERE BEFORE IT'S TRYING TO SWITCH OVER NONPROFIT I CAN ASSURE YOU AS LONG AS BPI HAS SHARES ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE. IT WILL RUN THE EXACT SAME WAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL.

I'M LOS SITES AND ANY ANY HAD A MOTION. DOESN'T GET MUCH BETTER IN MATH I KNOW. I'LL BE QUICK [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FIRST I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE COMMITMENT THEY'LL TAKE THE AMENDMENTS. I'M LAID OUT IN THE COMMITTEE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE I APPRECIATE THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL. I'M PROUD TO PRESENT AB THIRTEEN THIRTEEN WHICH SIX TO ENSURE THAT A STUDENT'S FUTURE IS NOT% HELD HOSTAGE BY COLLEGES BY PROHIBITING POST SECONDARY SCHOOLS FROM REFUSING TO PROVIDE A TRANSCRIPT. ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE STUDENT OWES A DEBT. COLLEGE TRANSCRIPTS ARE CRITICAL DOCUMENTS THAT STUDENTS OFTEN NEED TO OBTAIN A JOB OR PURSUE A HIGHER DEGREE -- TODAY I'M HAPPY TO HAVE WITH ME TOO TWO WITNESSES TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WHO IS THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. AND A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE STUDENT BORRAR PROTECTION CENTER THANK YOU. WELCOME. I THANK YOU MY NAME IS ANTHONY LEAVE THEM WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE THE AG IS PROUD. TO SPONSOR AB. THIRTEEN THIRTEEN WHICH SEEKS TO RESTRICT POST SECONDARY SCHOOLS FROM THE PRACTICE OF WITHHOLDING STUDENT TRANSCRIPTS AS A MEANS OF DEBT COLLECTION. AND WE SHARE THE AUTHORS CONCERNED THAT THIS PRACTICE HANDCUFFS STUDENTS FROM PURSUING EDUCATIONAL. AND CAREER OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR TRANSCRIPT IN ORDER TO APPLY FOR GRAD SCHOOL TRANSFER TO A BETTER SCHOOL OR OBTAIN A FELLOWSHIP FOR A JOB. SO WE JOINED THE CALL TO CHANGE THE CONVERSATION AROUND THIS. LONG STANDING METHOD OF COLLECTING DATA AND I WENT INTRODUCED. FIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- GOOD AFTERNOON MY MY NAME IS REBECCA MORE. YOU'RE FINE -- GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS REBECCA MORE MINUTE TOURNEY WHO REPRESENT STUDENT BORROWERS IN ADDITION TO MY LAW PRACTICE I'M A STUDENT LOAN JUSTICE FOLLOW AT THE STUDENT BORROWER PROTECTION CENTER. A NONPROFIT FOUNDED BY THE FORMER STUDENT LOAN OMBUDSMAN AT THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. MY RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE PRACTICE OF TRANSCRIPT WITHHOLDING WHICH IS THE FOCUS OF THIS BILL. IN MY CAPACITY AS AN ADVOCATE AND DOESN'T SB PC FELLOW I'M PLEASED TO SPEAK TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB. THIRTEEN THIRTEEN I WANTED A THE COMMITTEE FOR THE INVITATION AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. THE PRACTICE OF TRANSFER WITHHOLDING ALLOWS AN INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION TO REFUSE TO PRODUCE AN OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT WHEN A STUDENT HAS A FINANCIAL HOLD ON THEIR ACCOUNT. CONSIDER A FAIRLY TYPICAL SITUATION JOHN SMITH IS ENROLLED IN A FOR PROFIT COLLEGE WHERE HE IS WORKING ON AN ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE. ONCE COMPLETED HE'LL BE ELIGIBLE FOR A PROMOTION AT WORK. JOHN IS ONLY A FEW CREDITS AWAY FROM FINISHING WHEN HIS CAR BREAKS DOWN AND HE HAS AN UNEXPECTED REPAIR. THIS CAR REPAIR SETS JOHN BACK FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS AND MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO COVER THIS TUITION PAYMENTS. JOHN WITHDRAWS FROM THE CLASS AND ENDS UP WITH THE FINANCIAL HOLD ON HIS ACCOUNT FOR THE UNPAID TUITION. A FEW MONTHS LATER JOHN IS READY TO COMPLETE HIS DEGREE BUT HE FINDS THAT HIS FOR PROFIT COLLEGE I'M DOES NOT HAVE FLEXIBLE POLICIES THAT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO RE ENROLL AND GET THE CREDIT HE NEEDS. HOWEVER THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DOWN THE ROAD DOES. THE PROBLEM JOHN'S ORIGINAL SCHOOL REFUSES TO RELEASE HIS TRANSCRIPT WELL JOHN HAS AND FINANCIAL HOLD ON HIS ACCOUNT. JOHN CANNOT TRANSFER HIS CREDITS CANNOT FINISH HIS DEGREE AND CANNOT EVEN APPLY FOR THE RACE THAT WOULD HELP HIM GET RID OF THIS TUITION DEBT. IN OTHER WORDS THE ECONOMIC POTENTIAL OF JOHNS TO GREET IS LOCKED UP IN THE TRANSCRIPT. IN MY RESEARCH IN IN MY PRACTICE I FOUND TRANSIT WITHHOLDING TO BE A COMMON PRACTICE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THE ECONOMIC POTENTIAL OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS IS LOCKED UP BECAUSE OF TRANSCRIPT WITHHOLDING. AB THIRTEEN THIRTEEN WILL LIMIT THE ABILITY OF INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION TO WITHHOLD TRANSCRIPTS BECAUSE OF SMALL FINANCIAL HOLDS. AB THIRTEEN THIRTEEN WILL UNLOCK THE ECONOMIC POTENTIAL OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS WHO ARE LOOKING TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVES THROUGH THE AMERICAN DREAM OF AN EDUCATION. FOR THESE REASONS I SUPPORT THE LEGISLATION THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. AGAIN SEE NINE ANY TWEETERS TWEETERS. LARA MATTOON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION WE'RE WORKING OUR WAY TO A SUPPORT WE ARE AWARE OF A HANDFUL OF SITUATIONS WHERE THIS HAS HAPPENED. WERE OUR COLLEGES WERE THE ONES USING THE AUTHORITY TO WITHHOLD TRANSCRIPTS MORE OFTEN WE HEAR THE SITUATIONS THAT WERE DESCRIBED IN THE TESTIMONY WHICH WE THINK IS NOT THE PRACTICE THAT BEST SUPPORTS OUR STUDENTS SO I HOPE TO BE IN SUPPORT IN YOUR NEXT COMMITTEE THANK YOU. OTHER TWEETERS. TYLER I DO ARMY AFTER THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WE OPPOSITION ON THE BILL AS WELL WE APPRECIATE -- THE AUTHOR'S INTENT AND WE WORK WITH THE STAFF AND THE SPONSORS WELL WE PRIMARILY SEE THIS METHOD FOR DEBT COLLECTION AS A WAY TO START A CONVERSATION WITH STUDENTS AND SOMETIMES WE'RE NOT HOLDING THEM TO YOU KNOW.

MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB. THIRTEEN FORTY THREE WHICH I BELIEVE IS A SIMPLE BILL TO PROTECT VETERANS AND TAXPAYER DOLLARS -- IN THE ME START BY SAYING LIKE STEP THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THANK YOU FOR WORKING ON IT AND I KNOW WE CONTINUE TO HAVE SOME WORK TO DO FORWARD -- AND AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS BILL WE SHOULD KEEP IN MIND THAT THESE ARE FOR PROFIT BUSINESSES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND WANT TO DO VERY WELL -- FINANCIALLY ESPECIALLY. WE HAVE SEEN ONE ACCESS TO STUDENT AID INCREASES AND REGULATIONS DECREES -- THAT'S WHEN POLICY MAKERS NEED TO STEP IN AND DO SOMETHING -- THERE IS A REASON THAT SHARES OF FOR PROFIT COLLEGES JUMPED 40% AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ELECTION BECAUSE INVESTORS KNEW THAT THERE WAS MONEY TO BE MADE. AND WE CAN BE ANGRY AT THEM FOR THAT THEY ARE FOR PROFIT BUSINESSES THAT'S WHAT THEY DO THEY MAKE MONEY -- AND THAT'S WHAT OUR JOB AS POLICY MAKERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROTECT OUR VETERANS AS WELL AS OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS. RIGHT NOW FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS HAVE VARIOUS TAXPAYER FUNDED SOURCES OF REVENUE. THAT TITLE FOR AID AND GI BENEFITS. IN SOME CAL GRANTS AS WELL. WHILE WE CURRENTLY HAVE A NINETY TEN RULE FOR TITLE FOUR EIGHT A SEPARATE EIGHTY FIVE FIFTEEN RULE FOR GI BILL BENEFITS DOES. TO REGULATIONS DON'T TALK TO EACH OTHER. AND DON'T ADD UP TO A SINGLE AMOUNT. SO ESSENTIALLY SCHOOLS CAN BE A DOLLARS BUT WITHOUT THE MANDATE THAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAVE. AND THAT'S NOT AGAIN IS NOT THEIR ROLE TO POLICE THEMSELVES THAT IS OUR ROLE AS POLICY MAKERS TO MAKE SURE OF THAT OUR VETERANS ARE. LEAVING THE SCHOOLS WITH HUGE AMOUNTS OF DEBT THAT THEY NEED TO PAY BACK. AND THAT DEBT BEING OFF THE THE THEIR TUITION MEAN ALL FUNDED BY TAXPAYER DOLLARS. STEP APART FROM THE NEW YORK FEDERAL RESERVE. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN RESEARCH SHOW THAT THE LINK BETWEEN HOW MUCH SCHOOLS CHARGE AND HOW MUCH IS AVAILABLE. IS DIRECTLY RELATED -- SO. THIS BILL SEEKS TO CONTAIN COSTS TO AN 8515% RULE ON TAXPAYER FUNDING -- IF SCHOOLS CAN'T MEET THAT THRESHOLD -- THEN WE ARE ASKING THAT 50% OF THEIR FUNDING OF THE MONEY THEY RECEIVE GO DIRECTLY TO TUITION AND I AM MINDFUL THAT WE'RE STILL FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS -- BUT WE WANT TO BE MINDFUL THAT THAT MONEY. IS INTENDED FOR STUDENTS IT IS NOT GOING TO SHAREHOLDER PROFITS AND TARGETED AT STUDENT RECRUITMENT -- WE KNOW THAT THAT'S UP FOR FOR PROFIT UNIVERSITIES THAT IS A HIGH THING THEY DO IS THEY GO AFTER STUDENTS THAT MONEY AT TAXPAYER DOLLARS SHOULD BE GOING INTO THE TEACHING [inaudible] I AM. WE COULD SET TUITION CAPS I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WANTS TO DO THAT OR WE COULD MAKE SKIDS SCHOOLS BID COMPETITIVELY FOR FEDERAL OR STATE RESOURCES -- BUT WE TOOK A NUMBER OF CONSERVATIVE APPROACH THAT JUST SAID BUT LET THE MARKET DECIDE LET THE MARKET DECIDE IF THE SCHOOL IS THAT GOOD THEN 50% OF THAT MONEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO COME FROM -- PRIVATE PAY OR IF NOT. THEY CAN HAVE THE FULL AMOUNT BUT THEN 50% OF THAT NEEDS TO GO TO TUITION -- IF THERE IS TRULY A BENEFIT TO THESE PROGRAMS AND SOMEONE OTHER THAN THE GOVERNMENT MUST BE WILLING TO PAY -- AND AGAIN REMEMBER STE THE THE THE THE VETERANS ARE LEFT WITH HUGE AMOUNTS OF DEBTS AFTERWARDS SO AGAIN BUT IN ESSENCE WERE PAYING TWICE -- WE KNOW -- PARTICULAR WASHINGTON ONE CONTROLLED CONGRESS CYCLED SO TO THE REGULATIONS ON THE SCHOOLS IN NINETEEN EIGHT NINETY EIGHT THE EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN ROLE WAS WEAKENED TO A RATIO OF NINETY TEN AND MORE RECENTLY THE US DEPARTMENT EDUCATION UNDER SECRETARY DEVICE HAS ROLLED BACK EVEN OTHER PROTECTIONS -- IN ADDITION TO WEAKENING REGULATIONS A HUGE INCREASE IN POST NINE ELEVEN GI BILL BENEFITS AND RECIPIENTS BEEN A NEW POT OF FEDERAL MONEY. COMING IN TO BE AVAILABLE -- WE KNOW THAT SCHOOLS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF TAXPAYER FUNDED PROGRAMS TO THE EXTENT THE CONGRESS PASSED A LAW TO PROTECT IT WELL WE ARE ALLOWING HER EVEN ENCOURAGING THE TARGETING OF PENSION BENEFITS TO FUND FOR PROFIT INSTITUTION. IT DEGRADES THE INTENT OF THE ROLE AND HERS VETERANS STUDENTS. MIGHT HEAR OPPONENTS SAY THAT THIS BILL WILL CLOSE 5275290% OF FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS IN THE STATE. WHICH TO ME IS A DEMONSTRATION OF HOW BIG THIS PROBLEM IS -- AND THISTHAT WOULD MEAN THAT THE MAJORITY OF FOR PROFIT COLLEGE BUSINESSES MODELS DEPEND ON ON THE ON THE STRUCTURE THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY USING. G. I. BENEFITS ARE SUBSIDIZING FOR PROFIT COLLEGES. WITH ME HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL ARE RAYMOND CURTIS FROM VETERANS EDUCATION SUCCESS AND DEAN A WHISTLEBLOWER WHO BROUGHT TO LIGHT THE RECRUITING PRACTICES AT ASHFORD UNIVERSITY. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR HEARING US THIS MORNING COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RAYMOND CURTIS. I AM THE STATE POLICY MANAGER FOR VETERANS EDUCATION SUCCESS AND I AM A AN IRAQ WAR VETERAN SERVED IN THE MILITARY IN THE ARMY FROM 200-032-2000 AND NINE AND IN IRAQ IN 200-052-0006. I AM HERE TODAY TO EXTEND -- IT'S PLAYING SOME ISSUES IN THE TWO PRIMARY PURPOSES OF THIS BILL -- SO THAT WE CAN THEN EXPLAINED -- THE THE DAMAGE HAS BEEN CAUSED BY THE LOOPHOLE THAT CURRENTLY EXIST WITHIN THE FEDERAL LAW SO FIRST OF ALL AS THE REPRESENTATIVE SPOKE ABOUT WE HAVE WAYS OF SETTING OF UNDERSTANDING PROPER PRICING WHEN TAX DOLLARS ARE PAYING FOR THINGS SUCH AS IS ANYTHING ADMITTED TO IT FROM THE DEPARTMENT. OF DEFENSE FOR BUYING WEAPONS OR THINGS LIKE THAT WE HAVE BEEN IN MORRIS IF WE'RE PAYING MEDICAL BILLS FOR SOMEBODY THE HOSPITAL CONSENT A BILL IN THE GOVERNMENT TELLS THEM HOW MUCH THEY'RE GOING TO PAY. SO WHEN IT COMES T THE EDUCATION -- PRICES THIS IS SET IN THIS WAS DECIDED WITH NINETY TEN ROLL THIS IS SET. BY ENSURING THAT AT LEAST 10% OF PRIVATE DOLLARS NO MATTER WHERE IT COMES FROM IS SPENT AT THE SCHOOL FOR THIS PRODUCT OTHERWISE THE PRODUCT IS OVER PRICED. IF THE PRODUCT IS OVERPRICED AND PEOPLE AREN'T SPENDING THEIR OWN DOLLARS ON THIS AND THERE IS A DISTINCT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SENDING SPENDING YOUR OWN DOLLARS AND SPENDING A VOUCHER THAT YOU RECEIVE THAT CAN BE USED FOR NOTHING ELSE EXCEPT FOR EDUCATION. SO THOSE OF THE THE WHAT THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS REGULATION SO IS TO ENSURE THAT THE MARKET IS FUNCTIONING PROPERLY AND WE AREN'T DRASTICALLY OVER PRICING THESE WELL WE SCHOOL INSTITUTIONS ARE DRASTICALLY OVER PRICING THE PRODUCT THAT THEY'RE OFFERING BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY CAN RECEIVE. FEDERAL TUITION DOLLARS FROM IT SECONDLY THIS IS GOING TO BE PROTECTING OUR VETERANS WHO RIGHT NOW ARE CAUGHT UP IN A LOOPHOLE THAT IS CAUSING PROBLEMS ACROSS THE ENTIRE COUNTRY VETERANS EDUCATION SUCCESS WE WORK WITH NEARLY NINE THOUSAND VETERANS WHO HAVE BEEN DEFRAUDED BY FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS. ACROSS THE ENTIRE COUNTRY ON IT'S OF THEM IN THIS VERY STATE. SO THE LOOPHOLE WAS CREATED BECAUSE THE NINETY TEN RULE STARTED IN THE NINETIES THE POST NINE ELEVEN GI BILL AND VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION WHICH I USED TO GO TO SCHOOL WAS CREATED IN THE AFTERWARDS IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AFTER THE INVASION OF IRAQ -- THE AFTER THE INVASION OF IRAQ -- SO. THAT BENEFIT AS WELL AS DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MONEY AS WELL AS BY THE WAY -- FOSTER CHILDREN BENEFITS -- DOESN'T FALL UNDER TITLE FOR WHICH IS HOW THE REGULATION DEFINES WHAT IS FEDERAL TUITION ASSISTANCE AND THAT'S HOW IT WAS IN THE NINETIES BUT NOW IT'S DIFFERENT. AND SO WE NEED TO BE INCORPORATING ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FEDERAL BENEFITS SO THAT THE REGULATION IS PROPERLY FUNCTIONING SO THAT WE'RE GETTING A PROPER PRICE. ON THE PRODUCT THAT IS BEING DELIVERED AND IT'S NOT SET BY THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FEDERAL TUITION ASSISTANCE THAT THE SCHOOLS CAN GET. A MINUTE. IF OF I MIGHT GO TO THE SECOND WITNESS -- JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GIVE EVERYONE THE ALLOTTED TIME. MY APOLOGIES OKAY. CHECK -- AGAIN MY NAME IS ACTING AS YOU HEARD FROM THE EARLIER I WAS A ADVISER AT ASHFORD UNIVERSITY ICE OUT OF THE TWO YEARS AND SEVEN MONTHS I SPENT THERE TWO POINT. TWO TWO YEARS AND SIX AND FOUR MONTHS OF THAT WAS SPENT AS A MILITARY ADVISER. ENROLLMENT SERVICES ADVISER FOR THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT. SO A BOOK OF MY WORK WAS CALLING THESE VETERANS EVERY SINGLE DAY TO GET THEM TO ENROLL IN SCHOOL AND I THINK THE MOST POWERFUL PART OF THIS IS THAT I WAS A VETERAN. AND BEFORE I WAS EMPLOYED AT ASHFORD WHEN EMPLOYED ME WITH ONLY THIRTY ONE COLLEGE CREDITS. I WAS NEARLY HOMELESS AND THAT WAS ONLY JOB IN SAN DIEGO THAT WOULD PAY OVER. SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR THIRTY COLLEGE CREDITS SO I JUMPED IN MY BODY AND AND I STARTED SALES FOR FOR THE MILITARY -- AND I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH VETERANS STRUGGLING TO GET ON THEIR FEET TRANSITION JUST LIKE I HAD SO I SAW SOMETHING IN THEM. AND I WANTED TO HELP THEM BUT I REALIZED LATER ON THAT AND ROLLING THEM INTO A FOR PROFIT UNIVERSITY WASN'T A BENEFIT TO THEM IT WAS DISENFRANCHISED ALREADY DISENFRANCHISED -- AND YEAH AGAIN THIS WAS ABOUT BEING THE STUDENTS FRIENDS GETTING THEM TO SIGN UP FOR SCHOOL AND FORGET ABOUT THEM. IF OUR NUMBERS WERE SLIPPING OUR DIRECTOR WOULD POST IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM. AND PUBLICLY POSTER NUMBERS ON THE PROJECTOR FOR OUR TEAM TO CHASTISE US AFTERWARDS -- ON TOP OF THAT THE PRESSURE WE WERE PUT TO GET THE STUDENTS VA DOCUMENTS COMPLETOS CRUCIAL'S CRUCIAL TO ASHFORD ATTAINMENT STRATEGY WAS PUSHING THEM. TO COMPLETE THESE VIDAK THAT'S RIGHT AWAY -- THE GI BILL MONEY IS KEY TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE PLACES LIKE ASHFORD -- THE THEY NEED TO SURVIVE WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE TO TARGET VETERANS KEEP THEIR SHAREHOLDERS HAPPY AGAIN THIS IS ALL ABOUT PUTTING PROFIT ABOVE EDUCATION IT IS A MODEL THAT FILLS OUR VETERANS FILLS OUR STUDENTS AND FILLS OUR COUNTRY'S. PLEASE PASS AB. FOR THIRTEEN FORTY THREE THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. YOUR NAME OF THE ORGANIZATION -- WITH.

TO GO TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE -- AND AT PLAY -- ACTUALLY IT LOOKED FOR A COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- I'VE MAPPED OUT MY SCHEDULE AND THAT WOULD HAVE TAKEN ME -- FOR MY PARTICULAR PROGRAM ARE AND AT LEAST TWO YEARS JUST TO MY PREREQUISITES BEFORE I COULD GET INTO SCHOOL -- AND THE OTHER ARE IN PROGRAMS I WAS ABLE -- TO LOCATE WHERE YOU THEIR WATERY BASED OR JUST NOT GOING TO WORK WITH WITH MY LIFE I I LIKE I SAID I HAVE ALREADY HAD -- A WIFE AND MY DAUGHTER AND WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE ARMY I DIDN'T HAVE TIME.

OF THE MOTION AND SECOND -- BY. A GONZALEZ -- AND LOW. GO AHEAD TO MAKE A PRESENTATION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT TODAY ON AB. SEVEN TEN POST SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS HAVE NO STANDARD SYSTEM WIDE PROCESS FOR CALCULATING A STUDENTS OFF CAMPUS HOUSING COSTS COLLEGES HAVE CONSIDERABLE DISCRETION OVER HOW THEY MEASURE EACH TYPE ACOSTA COMP COMPRISES THE COST OF ATTENDANCE. STUDENTS OFTEN FIND OFF CAMPUS HOUSING COST ESTIMATES IN ACCURATE LEAVING STUDENTS WITHIN AN ACCURATE PICTURE OF THE REAL PRICE TAG FOR THEIR COLLEGE DREAMS FOR CURRENT AND PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS IN ACCURATE ESTIMATES CANNOT ONLY THROW OFF THE STUDENTS BUDGETING BUT ALSO THEIR FINANCIAL AID PACKAGES. NO PART IN A STUDENTS BUDGET BUT MANY STUDENTS FIND THEIR BUDGETS DRASTICALLY REDUCED OR END UP TAKING MORE LOANS IN NEEDED. ONE WHEN ESTIMATES ARE INACCURATE THEY DO NOT ONLY DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL AID A STUDENT CAN GET THE CRATES UNANTICIPATED EXPENSES DUE TO AN ACCURATE HOUSING DATA THAT CAN BE COMPRISED. COMPRISES STUDENTS STUDIES FORCING THEM TO TAKE ON MORE PART TIME WORK OR ENCOUNTER HOUSING AND FOOD AND SECURITY AND AN INABILITY TO FOR TEXTBOOKS. STUDENTS WITH FEWER RESOURCES WERE ALREADY STRUGGLE TO AFFORD COLLEGE SHOULD NOT ENCOUNTER SYSTEM THAT MIS CALCULATES HOUSING COSTS. INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION TO USE ACCURATE DATA THAT REFLECTS THE ONGOING HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE AND THEIR SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. AB SEVEN TEN SIX TO ENSURE THAT WE DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE OR OVERESTIMATE COLLEGE COST WHICH CAN MEAN A DIFFERENCE OF A HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR. PERSPECTIVE IN CURRENT STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES DESERVE TO HAVE AN ACCURATE INFORMATION SO THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ABOUT COLLEGES AT ALL STAGES OF THE PROCESS. AB SEVEN TEN WILL ENSURE INSTITUTIONS USE THE FAIR MARKET RENT DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM FROM THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT DATA TO STANDARDIZE THE OFF CAMPUS HOUSING COSTS FOR STUDENTS. THIS DATA ALREADY EXIST IN PUBLICLYAND IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND MORE ACCURATELY PORTRAYS THE COST OF HOUSING IN THE COMMUNITIES SURROUNDING A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY. AB SEVEN TEN WILL HELP ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS TRUST OUR INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR COSTA LEVINE ESTIMATES WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS CHAIRED TO RUSSO FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION. I AND GARAK BILL HIM A STATE A STUDENT AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY AND ALSO CIVIC ENGAGEMENT OFFICER FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION. GOOD AFTERNOON OMMITTEE MEMBERS AND SHARE MEDINA MY NAME IS DEREK WILL HOME AND I AM A GRADUATING SENIOR IN COMMUNICATION STUDIES AND FUTURE MASTER STUDENT AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY. ALSO SERVICE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT OFFICER FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION. I THINK I MET SOMEONE MEMBER CERVANTES FOR AUTHORING A. B. SEVEN TEN A BILL CO SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION. STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE FACING A COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. AS SUCCESSFUL AS WE BEEN HOLDING OFF TUITION INCREASES WE CONTINUE TO FIGHT AGAINSTTHE INCREASING COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA. OUR ORGANIZATION IS WORKING WITH OTHER STATEWIDE COLLEGE STUDENT ASSOCIATIONS TO JOIN EVERY STUDENT VOICE IN CALIFORNIA. ON THE NEED FOR REFORM AND INVESTMENT IN OUR STATE AID SYSTEM. CENTRAL TO THE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM IS A FEDERALLY REQUIRED DISCLOSURE CALLED THE COST OF ATTENDANCE. CUSTER TENANTS IS ACTUALLY A MISNOMER THAT REALLY MEANS THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL AID THAT A STUDENT CAN RECEIVE ATTENDING THAT COLLEGE. MUCH OF THIS FORMULA INCLUDES COST SEVEN INSTITUTION LIKE TUITION FEES BUT OTHERS ARE NOT. LIKE HOUSING AND FOOD. THESE NUMBERS ARE ESTIMATES AND HAD NO SET FORMULA OR STANDARD. IN MANY CASES THESE NUMBERS WERE SET OVER A DECADE AGO UNDER ADJUSTED EVERY YEAR. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THOSE FIGURES WE FIND A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM. BASED ON RESEARCH BY THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER SERVICES GOES THE MOST EXPENSIVE COUNTY IN THE STATE WITH AVERAGE HOUSING COSTS OF ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH. WELL CENTERS GO STATE CASA ATTENDANCE ALLOWS A MAXIMUM OF ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTEEN DOLLARS A MONTH. FOR HOUSING AND FOOD. I LIVE IN A HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN SQUARE FOOT APARTMENT IN THE TENDERLOIN IN SAN FRANCISCO. RIGHT PAID FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH FOR RENT. THIS LEADS ME SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS LEFT FOR FOOD FORCING ME TO RELY ON SOCIAL SERVICES AND SAFETY NET PROGRAMS. EIGHT OTHER CSU CAMPUSES IN LESS EXPENSIVE MARKETS ALL HAVE THE EXACT SAME COST OF ATTENDANCE NUMBERS. HOW IS THIS AN ACCURATE ASSESSMENT IF THOSE STUDENTS ARE PAYING FOUR HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS LESS? PER MONTH FOR HOUSING ON AVERAGE. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE FEDERAL HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT FAIR MARKET RATE HOUSING FIGURES FOR EFFICIENCY UNIT? WE FIND THAT NINETEEN OF THE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES UNDERESTIMATE THEIR COST FIGURES BY TWO THOUSAND TO EIGHT IN MY EDUCATION I'VE LEARNED. THAT THE VA EVERY SYSTEM IS PERFECTLY DESIGNED TO GET THE RESULTS THAT IT ACHIEVES. THE RESULT HERE THAT WE HAVE AN EPIDEMIC A STUDENT HOMELESSNESS AND MOUNTING OBSTACLES TO COMPLETING AN EDUCATION. MANY STUDENTS COME TO SERVICES GO STATE FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE NOT REALIZING HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS. BECAUSE THE NUMBERS THE FINANCIAL AID ADMINISTRATORS GIVE THEM. THE RESULT IS THAT THEY FEEL BETRAYED AND DISEMPOWERED BY OBSTACLES THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR COURSE WORK. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA CANNOT GET HELP FROM FINANCIAL AID BECAUSE THEY'RE SET EXPENSES EACH MONTH EXCEED THE CAMPUS MAXIMUM. THE STANDARDIZATION OF THESE NUMBERS ONE POWER MILLIONS OF STUDENTS AND NOT COST ONE DOLLAR AND BUDGET EXPENDITURES. MY RETURN TO MY EDUCATION BEEN AND REACHING AND REWARDING EXPERIENCE THAT I'M AND I'M THANKFUL FOR THE MATURITY I HAVE. TO HANDLE ALL THE SACRIFICES THE STUDENTS TODAY ARE ASKED TO MAKE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THOSE IN HERE DIFFERENT IN ONE TWENTY SIX YES. FIRST OF ALL I GET THANK YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH US ON THIS ISSUE AND FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE CAN PROTECT. OUR STUDENTS IN THE FOR PROFIT COLLEGE UNIVERSITY THEY WANT -- TO FIRST OF ALL EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS OUTLINE THE ANALYSIS. SO THIS MEASURE WOULD CLOSE THE LOOP HOLES ON THE SENSUALLY THE KICKBACKS INCENTIVES THAT CURRENTLY EXIST IN THE FOR PROFIT COLLEGE IN HISTORY. ALMOST EVERY MAJOR SCANDAL INVOLVING FOR PROFIT COLLEGES. STARTED WITH THEIR SO CALLED RECRUITERS THESE RECRUITERS ARE RELIGIOUS HIGH PRESSURE SALES PEOPLE THINK OF THE BOILER ROOM THE MOVIE THE BOILER ROOM. THEY GET PAID BY THIS BY THE NUMBER OF BODIES THEY PUT IN SEATS I WHISTLE BLOWERS WERE PART OF THE AG COMPLAINT AGAINST ASHFORD UNIVERSITY. TALKED ABOUT THESE TYPE OF BOILER ROOM TACTICS AND SOME OF THE MOST AGGRESSIVE SALES TAX ACT AS THEY'VE EVER SEEN. OTHER RECRUITERS WHO WORKED FOR THE FOR PROFIT EVEREST COLLEGE RECORDED SAYING THEY WERE LAID OFF FOR FIELD FOR FAILING TO MEET THE ENROLLMENT QUOTAS. AND THE BOMB SO THEY GOT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER EVERY A DOZEN OR SO STUDENTS THEN ROLLED OUT WORSE. OF COURSE IS THESE COLLEGES ARE PUBLICLY FUNDED -- ENTITIES WITH OUR TAX DOLLARS FOR FINANCIAL AID. SO IN IN ESSENCE -- OUR TAX DOLLARS ARE AT RISK. THE TAXPAYERS ARE GETTING THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK -- COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE SADDAM WITH A LOT OF DEBT AND NOT A LOT OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AT THE END OF THE DAY. AND THIS IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE THAT WOULD FOCUS ON THE HARSH RECRUITING TACTICS OF THESE ENTITIES AND MAKE SURE THAT WE PROTECT STUDENTS GOING FORWARD -- WITH ME ARE TWO WITNESSES TO OUTLINE -- THIS ISSUE -- BOB. MUSIC EXCUSE ME AND STEPHANIE SAIFUL THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS STEPHANIE STIEFEL I SPEAK TO YOU TODAY AS A VETERAN AND A FORMER STUDENT OF A FOR PROFIT COLLEGE. WHEN I WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD I WAS ATTENDING THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA IN TAMPA? WHILE AT A ON CAMPUS CAREER FAIR I WAS RECRUITED BY -- RECRUITERS FROM INTERNATIONAL ACADEMY OF DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY. I SPOKE TO THOSE COUNSELORS ABOUT MONEY -- OBSTACLES ATTENDING THE LARGE UNIVERSITY LARGE CLASS SIZES -- BEING A SMALL FISH IN A BIG CITY KIND OF THING. AND LATER I BEGAN THE PROCESS OF THOUGHT DURING THEIR SCHOOL AND SPEAKING FURTHERMORE WITH THEM -- THE COUNSELORS MADE THE PROGRAM I ADT VERY APPEALING TO ME THEY TOLD ME THAT THE SCHOOL HAD A COUNSELING SERVICE THAT PROMISE -- INTERNSHIPS OR JOB PLACEMENT ASSISTANCE -- LUCRATIVE CAREERS AND DESIGN. AT THAT POINT I WAS VERY INTERESTED AND I DECIDED TO ATTEND IN OCTOBER OF TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE I TRANSFERRED FROM U. S. F. TO IT TEAM. I STARTED TAKING MY CLASSES AND IT FELT LIKE THEY WERE JUST A CHECK IN THE BOX. I WAS NOT TRAINED ON SOME OF THE ADVANCED SOFTWARE THAT WAS NEEDED FOR CERTAIN PROJECTS THAT WERE ASSIGNED TO ME I WAS GIVEN MINIMAL INSTRUCTION. AND IT DID NOT MATTER IF THE WORK THAT I DID MYSELF AM IN COMPARISON TO MY PEERS WAS AVERAGE OR STELLAR WE ALL RECEIVED THE SAME GRADE. THERE WERE TIMES I WOULD RECEIVE A TEST BACK WE COMPARE WITH MY FELLOW STUDENTS I WOULD HAVE AN ANSWER MARK INCORRECT. AND A FELLOW STUDENT WOULD HAVE THE SAME ANSWER MARCH CORRECT. AFTER A YEAR OF APPLYING FOR DESIGN SCHOOLS AFTER COMPLETING MY DEGREE. I ADT. I WAS FORCED TO TAKE ON SEVERAL JOBS TO MAKE ENDS MEET -- EVENTUALLY LEADING ME TO JOIN THE MILITARY. I JOINED THE MILITARY WITH THE INCENTIVE OF HAVING MY LOANS PAID BACK. AFTER. COMPLETING ALL OF MY TRAINING AS A CANINE MILITARY POLICE OFFICER. I WENT TO THE PROPER PEOPLE TO HAVE MY LOANS PAID BACK AND WAS TOLD I DID NOT QUALIFY BECAUSE OF THEIR CREDIT ATION OF THE SCHOOL. AT THIS POINT I ALSO REALIZE THAT THE SCHOOL WAS BEING CLOSED DOWN. MY CREDITS WOULD NEVER TRANSFERRED TO ANYWHERE EVEN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AT THIS TIME I ALSO WAS PAYING BACK STUDENT LOANS. TO THIS DAY I HAVE PAID OVER SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS BACK TO THESE LOANS. I LIKE I SAID HAVE A DEGREE THAT IS ESSENTIALLY A PIECE OF PAPER I CANNOT TRANSFER ANY CREDITS OR PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION. EVEN THOUGH I HAVE PAID OVER SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS I STILL -- OVER A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. I SPEAK TO YOU IN HOPES THAT YOU PASS THIS BILL SO THAT THIS CAN NEVER HAPPEN TO ANOTHER STUDENT OR ANOTHER VETERAN AGAIN THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MY NUMBER SIR UNFORTUNATELY STEPHANIE'S STORY IS IS ALL TOO COMMON ME. SINCE WE FOUNDED THE CLINIC IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WE HAVE REPRESENTED LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF VETERANS WHO HAVE BEEN SCAMMED -- BY FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS -- THERE'S TWO MAIN TIME FRAMES WHEN THE MISCHIEF OCCURS ONE IS DURING THE RECRUITMENT PROCESS AND ONE IS AFTER A MOMENT IN THIS BILL WILL SQUARELY ADDRESSED SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAPPENED DURING THE RECRUITMENT PROCESS. MY CLIENTS REPORT TO ME ALMOST UNIFORMLY -- THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO HIGH PRESSURE SALES TACTICS THAT INCLUDES DOZENS OF UNSOLICITED PHONE CALLS EMAILS LETTERS I'VE HAD CLIENTS WHO HAD RECRUITER SHOP AT THEIR HOUSES. SHOP AT THEIR PLACE OF BUSINESS TRYING TO GET THEM TO A ROLE IN THE SCHOOLS. AND THEY'VE BEEN LIED TO ABOUT ALMOST EVERYTHING YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE BEING LIED TO WITH RESPECT TO A PROGRAM. THEY'VE BEEN TOLD -- MIS INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO JOB PLACEMENT RATES. WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ATTENDING AN ACCREDITED SCHOOL THE TOTAL LENGTH OF TIME OF THE PROGRAM THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE INSTRUCTORS AND THE MATERIAL THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE UTILIZING. I'VE EVEN HAD THAT EARNS WHO BEEN MISLED AS TO WHETHER THE SCHOOL COULD HAVE REASONABLY ACCOMMODATE THEIR SERIOUS SERVICE CONNECTED DISABILITIES. AND I THINK THE CRUX OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE FOR PROFIT SCHOOL MODEL HAS INCENTIVIZED BAD BEHAVIOR BY RECRUITERS. WHEN THE COMPENSATION AND VARIOUS AND SUNDRY OTHER RELATED ASPECTS OF THEIR? WOMEN ARE TIED TO HOW MANY STUDENTS CAN BE ENROLLED. BY THAT INDIVIDUAL RECRUITER IT'S ALMOST INEVITABLE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS IN SO I BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL GO UP AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD IN ENSURING THAT WE HAVE LESS VETERANS WERE SEEKING OUR SYSTEMS DOWN THE ROAD. I SUPPORT THE BILL IN AND I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO SO AS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

JUST HOW TO ME -- FROM HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THERE ARE NO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION -- I'M SORRY. GOOD AFTERNOON. IT IS ALWAYS GOOD COMING IN AFTER ABOUT SEVENTY PEOPLE HAVE COME IN BEFORE ME. APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S PATIENCE -- MY NAME'S KIDS ACRONYM A PARTNER OF TWIN MORRIS AND I'M GENERAL COUNSEL THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PRIVATE POST SECONDARY SCHOOLS. I I SPECIALIZED IN LAW OF PRIVATE COLLEGES -- AND IN A FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS. I WAS DEEPLY INVOLVED WITH THE C. PPV THE THE PPV. THE BPP AND WAS INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT LED TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE CURRENT ACT. OF THE THIS BILL RESPECTFULLY IS A A SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM. I'D RESPECT WE SUGGESTED TO BE BAD POLICY AND DESTRUCTIVE. THE SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL ARE BASING THEIR ARGUMENTS ON SOME INACCURATE FACTUAL PREMISES I'LL BE VERY BRIEF. FIRST CALIFORNIA LAW AND IN THE ARTEDUCATION CODE NINETY FOUR EIGHT NINETY SEVEN ALREADY PROHIBITS COMMISSIONING. SO THAT'S THE EXISTING LAW WITHIN OUR EXCEPTIONS PROGRAMS LESS THAN NINETY DAYS. ABLE ONLY AFTER COMPLETION AND FOR ANY EXCEPTIONS PROVIDER IN THE FEDERAL LAW WITCHER EXCEPTIONALLY NARROW. IN BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE LAW PROHIBITS PROVIDING ANY GIVE TO A STUDENT THAT IN CASH. AND LIMITS ANY GIFTS TO EXTREMELY NET VERY SMALL NOMINAL AMOUNTS IN NON CASH. KNOW THAT THE BILL'S AUTHOR CLAIMS THAT IN ALMOST EVERY ABUSE I'M QUOTING HERE. BY THE HIGHEST PROFILE FOR PROFITS ORIGINATES WITH HIGH PRESSURE SALES TACTICS MOTIVATED BY BOUNTIES PAY THE SALES PEOPLE FROM ROLLING STUDENTS. NO MATTER WHETHER THE STUDENT OR NOT IS PREPARATION IS PREPARED TO SUCCEED IN SCHOOL. THIS IS UNTRUE THERE ARE NO CONDITIONS THERE ARE NO BOUNTIES THERE ARE NO BONUSES. AND THEIR EXISTING FEDERAL LAW NO PERSON INVOLVED IN ANY WAY WITH ADMISSIONS OR FINANCIAL AID. NO THE SALARIES INCREASE OR DECREASED FOR SUCCESS OR FAILURE IN ADMISSION. DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. IT'S JUST NOT TRUE AND THE COMMITTEE REPORT DOESN'T CITE ANY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE ASSERTION. TO MY KNOWLEDGE IT DOESN'T EXIST. IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF DOING THIS WORK. REPRESENTING. HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF SCHOOLS OVER THE YEARS I NEVER ONCE SEEN A SCHOOL FOUND LIABLE. FOR PAYING COMMISSIONS OF ANY KIND AND I THINK THAT'LL PROBABLY BE AT LEAST ONE OF THE ONES TO KNOW. A POINT OF IMPORTANT INFORMATION HERE UNDER THE NEW FEDERAL AUDIT GUIDE IN ACTED LAST YEAR. THE CPA'S THAT HAVE TO ORDER THE SCHOOLS FOR COMPLAINTS EVERY YEAR A REQUIRED TO DO FORENSIC EXAMINATION TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE IS ANY INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PAID. DOWN TO THE GENERAL LEDGER DOWN TO THE PAYROLL AND THEY LOOK PRETTY HARD IN THE RECORDS WOULD TEST INDEPENDENTLY OF THE ABSENCE OF INCENTIVE COMPENSATION. SO IT'S JUST NOT TRUE THAT ANY OF THE SCHOOLS RECENTLY CLOSED OR SOMETHING CLOSE TO WHILE AGO. HAD INSTEAD OF A COMMISSION INSTRUCTOR -- STRUCTURES IT'S IT'S REALLY A NONEXISTENT PROBLEM. THE TWIST OF THE CURRENT BILL. SINCE THE THE CONDUCT SPOKEN OF IS LARGELY PROHIBITED BY CURRENT LAW IS A TWIST THAT PROHIBIT SCHOOLS FROM TERMINATING THE EMPLOYEE THE IN THE EMPLOYMENT ADMISSIONS WRAPS -- WARP INSTRUCTORS THAT ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN DOING YOUR JOB. NOW THAT THAT THAT SEEMS SILLY WOULD CREATE -- CLASPING PLEASE IN THE STATE THE ONLY EMPLOYEES IN THE STATE TO MY KNOWLEDGE. OF THAT WOULD KEEP THEIR JOBS NO MATTER HOW EFFECTIVE THEY ARE DOING IT. NO BUSINESS SHOULD HAVE TO KEEP AN EMPLOYEE THAT'S NOT COMPETENT. THIS IS AN ESTABLISHED RIGHT ON THE TITLE FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT APPROVED IT IN THE POT VERSUS SILICON VALLEY CASE QUITE SOMETIME AGO. THINK OF IT LIKE A SMOG STATION IF IT MAKES SENSE TO BAN COMMISSIONS THAT MECHANICS GIVE PEOPLE A PASS WHEN THEIR CARS TO PASS. BUT MAKES NO SENSE TO REQUIRE THAT IN THAT MECHANICS WHO CAN'T REPAIR CARS SHE KEEP THEIR JOBS. STATE AM I HEARD IN THE FOLKS THAT CAME BEFORE ME ABOUT THIS WAS A BAD ACTS. MISSIONS WITH THIS BILL DOESN'T SPEAK TO THAT THE LAW BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE ALREADY PROHIBIT MISREPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND OF MISSIONS. IN THE RECENT CLOSURES OF TERRIBLE ARE NOT ADMISSIONS ISSUES IN ANY OF THAT THERE'S JUST NO EVIDENCE NONE THAT IMMUNIZING EMPLOYEES FROM -- IT PERFORMANCE STANDARDS WOULD HAVE A BENEFICIAL RESULT. THE REPORT ALSO REFERS TO ONE PROVEN ANECDOTES ABOUT SUPPOSE IT ILL TREATMENT OF ADMISSIONS RAPS. IN AN UNEDUCATED ATTORNEY GENERAL LAWSUIT -- I THINK MAKING POLICY BY ANECDOTE PROBABLY ISN'T THE WAY TO PROCEED ONE FINAL POINT AND THEN I'LL CONCLUDE HERE ABOUT OTHER BAD CONSEQUENCES. FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS AND AND I WOULD ASK YOU TO WRAP IT UP YES SIR -- FEDERAL LAW PERMITS SCHOOLS TO CONTRACT WITH SERVICE ENTITIES TO HELP WITH A VARIETY OF NON EDUCATIONAL TASKS THEY CAN BE PAID TO THE PERCENTAGE OF TUITION RECEIVE THIS CALL BUNDLED SERVICES. THIS BILL WOULD BLOW UP THOSE PERFECTLY LEGAL AGREEMENTS WHICH RUN OFFENSIVE AND NOT IMPLICATED IN ANY MISCONDUCT. I'D RESPECTFULLY URGE THE COMMITTEE REJECT THE BILL IT'S BAD POLICY IT'S DESTRUCTIVE AND WRONG THE PROBLEM WITH SIX TO TO TO ELIMINATE HAS ALREADY BEEN OUTLAWED AND IT'S NOTHING NEW. THANK YOU THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MAP BACK REPRESENTING CAPS IN OPPOSITION. FRED JONES REPRESENT THE PROFESSIONAL BEAUTY FEDERATION CALIFORNIA JUST CONCERNED ABOUT RETAINING STUDENTS THE PRECLUSION ON INCENTIVE PAY FOR THAT THANK YOU. I HAVE AN ULTIMA REPRESENTING SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY COLLEGE IN CARRINGTON COLLEGE IN OPPOSITION. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY. ANY TWEETERS. C. NINE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE THIS GUY. A FOR THE OPPOSITION WITNESS I I'VE LOST TRACK OF WHERE HE WENT HE'S A GROCER YES I THINK YOU -- SO I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND YOUR ARGUMENT. YOU'RE SAYING THAT -- THE SIR PRACTICES OF THIS BILL IS -- SEEKING A REGULATOR ALREADY -- FORBIDDEN BUT YOU THINK THAT THIS BILL WOULD WOULD SORT OF GO A STEP FURTHER AND AND OUTLAW PERFORMANCE STANDARDS CAN YOU EXPLAIN A LITTLE MORE WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT WHAT KIND OF LEGITIMATE PRACTICES THIS WITH INCREDIBLE. YES SIR THE COMMISSIONING IS ALREADY ILLEGAL UNDER BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL LAW. THE THE THE THE PROVISIONS IS BUILT TO THAT EXTENT ARE REDUNDANT OF EXISTING LAW AND HAD NOTHING. THIS BILL GOES A LITTLE FURTHER AND TALKED ABOUT. HAVING IT MAINTAINING EMPLOYMENT OF PEOPLE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THEY ENROLL OR IT USES THE WORD QUOTA IS A LOADED TERM. BUT BASICALLY IS IS A CIRCUIT PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. THE IDEA I THINK OF OF THE ADVOCATES IS THAT THE ADMISSIONS REP SHOULDN'T BE A SHOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR JOBS EVEN IF THEY CAN'T ENROLL STUDENTS. AND THE IDEA I THINK BEHIND IT IS THAT. THE THE FEAR OF LOSING YOUR JOB CAUSES PEOPLE TO SAY AND DO BAD THINGS I SUSPECT THAT THE THE THE THE SHORTHAND WAY TO DO IT. OBVIOUSLY BAD ACTOR READY MISS REPRESENTATION ABUSIVE ACTS AND OTHER ALSO THE DECEPTIVE ACTS ALREADY ILLEGAL. BUT MY POINT SIR IS THAT. A BUSINESS OUGHT TO BE A MISSION TRIP JOBS TO ENROLL STUDENTS. THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT OUT THERE WITH PRESS GANGS PULLING METAL BARS THE RULING OF THESE ARE STUDENTS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO ALLOWED TO ENROLL. IN THESE LEGITIMATE AND LEGAL PROGRAMS IT ADMISSIONS REP CAN'T% SUCCEED IN DOING THAT. NOT COPIES DO THEIR JOB. NOW THE IDEA I I THINK OF MY FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE IS THAT. THOSE INCENTIVES ARE BAD AND THAT THE IF IF THOSE INCENTIVES ARE ELIMINATED THEY'LL BEHAVE BETTER. AND THEREFORE THESE ABUSES WON'T OCCUR I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT. AND THE BAD CONDUCT IS ALREADY UNLAWFUL IN OTHER WAYS. NO BUSINESS SHOULD HAVE TO KEEP EMPLOYEES THAT THEY CAN'T DO THEIR JOB -- I I I LOOK IS HARD AS I COULD AND COULDN'T FIND ANOTHER CLASS IN PLACE IN CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD HAVE THAT KIND OF PROTECTION. AND THIS WOULD APPLY FOR THOSE IN ADMISSIONS WRAPS -- THIS WOULD APPLY TO INSTRUCTORS PLACEMENT PEOPLE ANYBODY DOWNLINE ON WITHIN THE INSTITUTION ANY EMPLOYEE WHO LOST THEIR JOB WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY CLAIM. THAT THIS WAS THE CAUSE OF IT BECAUSE A LOT OF STERN AND DRAMA IN THIS WITHOUT I THINK. IT ADDING ADDING A LOT OF VALUE IN A FIND A WAY. IT'S IT'S IT'S BUILT WITHIN THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL IT GOES FURTHER THAN EXISTING LAW. IT'S THE ONLY PART OF THE BILL WHICH IS NEW OTHER THAN PERHAPS PROHIBITING THE USE THIRD PARTY CONTRACTS OKAY SO YOU YOU THINK IT'S IT'S OKAY -- FOR AS THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS YOU ENROLL TO BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF THE EMPLOYEES OVERALL -- JOB PERFORMANCE EVALUATION BUT IT'S ALREADY ILLEGAL IN IT IT'S ILLEGITIMATE IF THEY'RE SOMEHOW COMPENSATION IS TIEDTO THOSE NUMBERS LIKELY. ALL THE ADMISSIONS WRAPS IN CALIFORNIA AND NATIONALLY TO MIKE TO MY KNOWLEDGE THEY DO THIS WORK VERY EXTENSIVELY A STRAIGHT SALARY. AT THIS POINT THERE'S THERE'S JUST NO WAY TO PAY PEOPLE AN INCENTIVE EVEN EVEN THE SOUL THING LEFT OPEN BY THE BY THE THE FEDS UNDER THE TITLE. FOR WHICH WOULD BE PAY GRADUATION BONUSES ONLY ONE SCHOOL IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY TO MY KNOWLEDGE. DOES THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL AFRAID TO DO IT EVERYONE IS SWITCH TO STRAIGHT SALARY I'VE WRITTEN MOST OF THOSE PLANS. A FOR PEOPLE NOW. IF IT'S A DIFFERENT THING TO GIVE PEOPLE A MONETARY INCENTIVE -- SET. PEOPLE ARE BOUNTY OR OR COMMISSION ONE OF ITS READY LEGAL AND WAS ILLEGAL IN THE MAXINE WATERS ACTED IT'S ILLEGAL NOW. IT MISSED RECORDED YOU AGREE WITH THAT KIND OF CHARACTERIZATION THE DISTINCTION. BETWEEN YOU KNOW -- JUST BEING PART OF YOUR EVALUATION ON THE ONE HAND AND PROVIDING FINANCIAL INCENTIVES ON THE OTHER. I DON'T I THINK THE FACT PATTERN BACK AND FORTH ARE TAKING OUT A BIT OUT OF CONTEXT AND I I BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THE ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED IN THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT WE ADOPTED. BUT COMMON ASK MISTER -- CHARMIN TO HELP US OUT RELATE. TO THE CONFLICT BETWEEN FEDERAL AND STATE LAW SURE YES I WOULD BE CURRENT VERSION OF THE CALIFORNIA LAW DEFERS TO THE FEDERAL IF YOU'RE COMPLYING COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL. OR SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL RULE THAN THE STATE ROLE HAS NO AFFECT WHAT WE SEEN OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IS THAT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION BASICALLY TOLD SCHOOLS WERE NOT REALLY GOING TO ENFORCE THIS AND EVEN IF IT DOES GET ENFORCED WHEN NOT GONNA FIND YOU VERY MUCH. SO WE HAD A LOT OF VIA A LOT OF CROSSING COMING REALLY SUPER CLOSE TO THE LINE PROBABLY CROSSING THE LINE AND THEN IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION THERE WAS MORE ENFORCEMENT SO IT SO PART OF THE GOAL OF THIS BILL. IS A STOP DEFERRING TO THE FEDERAL IF WE WANT TO ENFORCE THIS ON OUR OWN IN CALIFORNIA WE CAN. DO SO -- AND THAT'S AND THEN ADDRESS SOME OF THE LOOPHOLES AND IN THE FEDERAL LAW -- INCLUDING THE BUNDLING PROBLEM WHICH I'M EMBARRASSED TO SAY I HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH CREATING THAT PROGRAM THAT THAT LOOPHOLE I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD BE A PROBLEM IT HAS PROVEN TO BE A PROBLEM THAT ALLOWS SCHOOLS TO BASICALLY HIDE. THIS -- THESE BOUNTY PAYMENTS IN THESE PERCENTAGE OF TUITION PAYMENTS TO COMPANIES THAT ARE -- DAD THAT TO COMPANIES THAT ARE DOING THE RECRUITING AS WELL AS SOME OTHER THINGS -- ON QUOTAS -- I I RECENTLY VISITED -- A VERY AGGRESSIVE FAST GROWING -- ONLINE COLLEGE WHICH HAPPENS TO BE NONPROFIT SENT A SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE UNIVERSITY AND I ASKED THE PRESIDENT OF THAT UNIVERSITY DO YOU USE QUOTAS IN YOUR IN YOUR RECRUITING AND HE SAID. ACTUALLY I SAID SO IF THERE WAS A BILL THAT THAT SAID NO QUOTAS -- FOR FOR FOR YOUR ADVISORS YOU PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING WHO ARE RECRUITING HE SAID I WOULD HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM WITH THAT WE JUDGE OUR EMPLOYEES BASED ON THE QUALITY OF THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE. INTERESTED IN ENROLLING IN THE SCHOOL AND THEIR OTHER NUMERICAL THINGS YOU CAN HAVE NUMBERS OF CONTACTS WITH PEOPLE WHO CALL THE SCHOOL -- THOSE KINDS OF NUMBERS BUT WHEN YOU CONDITION. EMPLOYMENT OR HATE OR PAY ON GETTING THE ACTUAL SALE THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY TELLING. YOUR EMPLOYEES OR CONTRACTORS DO WHATEVER YOU POSSIBLY CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU NEED TO TO GET THIS ENROLLMENT AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO PREVENT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MISTER LOWE YEAH YES I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR -- SPECIFICALLY FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK IN THIS AREA OF HIGHER EDUCATION WHETHER OR NOT IT BE YOU -- WITH. OUR FORMER AT UC DAVIS CHANCELLOR OR A NUMBER OF TRANSPARENCY ISSUES BUT I JUST APPRECIATE BRING THIS FORWARD IN ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF OPPOSITION AS YOU CAN TO MOVE FORWARD. AND THAT'LL MAKE A MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OF THE MR -- IF MCCARTY V. LIKE CLOTHES. THANK YOU I I THINK THIS IS A VALUE STATEMENT THAT THAT WE THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT INDUSTRY ONE THAT UNFORTUNATELY PREYS UPON STUDENTS POOR STUDENTS STUDENTS OF COLOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR -- WITH TREMENDOUS STUDENT AT THE END WITH LIMITED. JOB PROSPECTS AND HAVING MORE TRANSPARENT TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE RECRUITING THEM I THINK GO A LONG WAY TO TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS SADLY RIVAL AND WE'VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED THAT YOU EXCEPT IN THE YES THE AMENDMENTS. WELL I I WANT TO ECHO MANY OF THE STATEMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES -- I I WAS -- AS MANY OF YOU KNOW HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATOR RIDE FOR THIRTY SOME YEARS. AND YOU KNOW WHERE WORK BY STUDENTS DID AFTER HIGH SCHOOL WAS IMPORTANT TO ME AND WHERE THEY WENT. AND I HAD HEARD STORIES YOU KNOW AS A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER. SOME OF THE STORIES THAT MISS MCCARTY ALLUDED TO ABOUT -- YOUNG. SPECIALLY A LATINO MALES BEING. LOOKED FOR AMONG SOME OF THESE -- FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS -- BUT I I HAD LIMITED INFORMATION AS A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER -- BUT BUT BUT TODAY FROM WHAT I HEAR HEAR FROM ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ACROSS THE NATION EVEN. I I I HAVE TO SAY THAT I AM. REALLY KIND OF APPALLED BY SOME OF THE PRACTICES THAT I'M HEARING ABOUT. I I I REALLY HAD AN INDIVIDUAL CALL ME TEX ME YESTERDAY SHE LATINA WAITRESS. OF FORMER WAITRESS WORKING IN A WAREHOUSE IN RIVERSIDE. AND SHE SAID THAT SHE WANTED. SHE WAS GOING TO GO BACK TO BEING A WAITRESS BECAUSE SHE FELT IT WAS A BETTER JOB. BUT AT THE SAME TIME SHE HAS TWO CHILDREN TWO TWO YOUNG KIDS AND SHE WANTED. TO ADVANCE YOUR EDUCATION AND SO SHE HAD PICKED OUT -- A FOR PROFIT SCHOOL. A FOR PROFIT SCHOOL. TO STUDY A MEDICAL CODING. AND I TEXTED HER BACK. I TEXTED HER BACK LAST NIGHT BE CAREFUL. BE CAREFUL OF WHERE YOU GO ASK QUESTIONS. BUT THAT BE CAREFUL TODAY. IT SEEMS LIKE. NOT EVEN STRONG ENOUGH ADVICE -- I'M GLAD I TOLD HER TO BE CAREFUL AND ASK QUESTIONS BECAUSE AGAIN. I AS CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE. I I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO DESCRIBE SOME OF THE PRACTICES THAT I'VE HEARD HERE. SO I VERY MUCH THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. WE HAVE A MOTION. BY MISTER LOWE. WE NEED A SECOND. SECOND BY MS GONZALEZ FLETCHER -- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS DO PASS TO THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE MEDINA. MEDINA I CHILE [inaudible] GLORIA [inaudible] BLOOM [inaudible] GABRIEL -- WHEN [inaudible] KYLIE. KYLIE NOT VOTING [inaudible] GONZALEZ. IN DALLAS I LOW. LOW I PATTERSON SANTIAGO WEBER EVER I FOUR ZERO WE WILL LEAVE THAT OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS NEXT. ITEM -- THIRD TEEN. THIS FLOWER OKAY AND AND I HOPE I DID OKAY AND THE NAME. THANK YOU THANK YOU. I LIKE HYPHENATED NAMES THANK YOU. SO WE ARE AN ITEM THIRTEEN A B.. THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR BOTH THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE I'M HERE TO PRESENT A B. THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ALL YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL AND AM I ACCEPT ALL THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND IT'S IN THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT PROVIDES CRITICAL CONSUMER PROTECTIONS TO SAFEGUARD. NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ENROLLED IN ONLINE FOR PROFIT OUT OF STATE INSTITUTIONS. AND THE LARGEST SHARE CALIFORNIANS ENROLLED IN ONLINE SCHOOLS. ARE ENROLLED IN FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS IN OTHER STATES. AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST TROUBLED BUSINESS SECTORS IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY AS WE HEARD EARLIER FROM MY COLLEAGUE. OUT OF STATE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE WORSE STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT OUTCOMES IN CALIFORNIA BASED DISTANCE EDUCATION PROVIDERS. THEY SHARE BORROWERS WHO END UP IN DEFAULT IS ALSO HIRED AT THESE OUT OF STATE DISTANCE EDUCATION PROVIDERS THAN ANY IN STATE PROVIDERS. HOWEVER CALIFORNIA LAW DOES NOT HOLD THESE OUT OF STATE INSTITUTIONS TO THE SAME STANDARDS AS THOSE IN OUR OWN STATE SO THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE THAT WILL BRING THOSE OUT OF STATE INSTITUTIONS IN LINE -- TODAY WITH ME TO TESTIFY IS SUSAN CURTIS A FORMER STUDENT KAPLAN UNIVERSITY AND ANGELA PERRY A POLICY ANALYST WITHTHE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS. AT HOWARD IS ALSO HERE FROM AND CHILDREN'S ADVOCATES ADVOCACY INSTITUTE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND I WILL TURN IT OVER TO YOU. HELLO MY NAME'S ANGELA PERRY ARE AND AS I'VE SAID BEFORE I'M A POLICY ANALYST WITH THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS -- WELL SOME HOPE THAT ONLINE EDUCATION CAN HELP MORE STUDENTS EARN COLLEGE DEGREES THE PROMISE OF DISTANCE EDUCATION ALSO HAS PERILS. THE CHALLENGES IN ASSESSING ACADEMIC RIGOR AND STUDENT OUTCOMES FOR ONLINE PROGRAMS CAN BE EVEN GREATER THAN THOSE AT TRADITIONAL PROGRAMS AND THERE'S A LONG HISTORY OF OVER PRICED AND POOR QUALITY PROGRAMS LEAVING STUDENTS WITH DEBTS THEY CANNOT AFFORD. OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN HIGHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS BASED EXCLUSIVELY ONLINE IN CALIFORNIA -- MOST OF THESE STUDENTS ARE ENROLLED AT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHERE TUITION IS LOW AND THE TOPIC THE CREDITS TYPICALLY TRANSFER TO OTHER PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. HOWEVER THERE ARE NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE ON A ROLL ONLINE IN PROGRAMS THAT ARE LOCATED OUT OF STATE. AND THE LARGEST SHARE OF THE STUDENTS ARE IT FOR PROFIT COLLEGES WERE STUDENTS ARE PARTICULARLY LIKELY TO END UP WITH DEBT THEY CANNOT REPAY. THE AVAILABLE DATA SHOW THAT THERE IS REASON FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE STUDENTS OUT OF STATE INSTITUTIONS THAT ENROLL CALIFORNIANS ONLINE HAVE BEEN WORSE STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT OUTCOMES THAN TO CALIFORNIA BASED ONLINE PROGRAMS. CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY WITH PREDATORY FOR PROFIT COLLEGES HAD LET HAS LED TO THE CREATION OF MANY LAWS DESIGNED TO PROTECT STUDENTS ENROLLED IN CALIFORNIA FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS. HOWEVER THESE LAWS HAVE TRADITIONALLY ONLY APPLIED TO SCHOOLS LOCATED WITHIN CALIFORNIA NOT SCHOOLS IN ROLLING CALIFORNIANS BUT IT BASED ELSE ELSEWHERE. CALIFORNIA TOOK AN IMPORTANT STEP IN TWENTY SIXTEEN BY REQUIRING OUT OF STATE COLLEGES TO REGISTER WITH THE BUREAU FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION AND TO PROVIDE GREATER ASSURANCES A FINANCIAL RELIEF TO STUDENTS WHO SCHOOLS OR PROGRAMS CLOSED. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE REGISTRATION SYSTEM SUFFERS FROM THREE KEY FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS. FIRST THE STATE LACKS THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO IDENTIFY REST TO CALIFORNIA STUDENTS SECOND THE STATE LACKS THE AUTHORITY TO REVOKE A SCHOOL'S REGISTRATION IF WRIST TO STUDENTS IS IDENTIFIED. AND THIRD THE SYSTEM LACKS A COMPLAINT PROCESS MEANING STUDENTS HAVE NO WAY TO IDENTIFY ISSUES WITH THE BUREAU DIRECTLY. ABC THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR ADDRESSES THESE ISSUES BY REQUIRING OUT OF STATE INSTITUTIONS TO REPORT WHEN KEY OCCURRENCES TAKE PLACE THAT MIGHT SIGNAL RISK TO CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. IT EMPOWERS THE BEER TO TAKE ACTION IF THEY DETERMINE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ARE AT RISK AND IT CREATES A COMPLAINT PROCESS FOR STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THESE ONLINE PROGRAMS. THESE ARE ESSENTIAL STEPS FORWARD FOR THE STUDENTS OF CALIFORNIA AND WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE BUY. IT NOW ALSO LIKE TO ALLOW SUSAN TO GIVE HER PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. HI THANK YOU -- AGAIN MY NAME SUSAN CURTIS I TOO AM A VETERAN OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY -- CAN MOVE THIS LITTLE OKAY COKE. THANK YOU -- I HAD WANTED -- TO I HAD WANTED TO STUDY PARALEGAL DEGREE I WAS WORKING WITH A MAJOR INSURANCE COMPANY WE'RE DOING A LOT OF CLAIMS THAT. LITIGATION AND I WAS BASICALLY ADMINISTRATIVE PROFESSIONAL. I'M AT THE TIME I WAS RESEARCHING UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES I WAS RESEARCHING SAINT MARY'S COLLEGE IN MORAGA. THEY HAD A PARALEGAL PROGRAM BUT THE PROGRAM WAS ACTUALLY BEING PHASED OUT OF THEIR UNIVERSITY -- SO -- NEED TO SAY AFTER SOME RESEARCH I HAD TO DECIDE TO GO WITH KAPLAN. I HAD A SON IN GRADE SCHOOL SO WORK FAMILY -- I WAS OF THE ESSENCE INTO BERIC GAINS SOME EDUCATION. AROUND -- UNDERSTANDING IN THAT AREA PARALEGAL STUDIES -- PARTICULARLY WHEN I CONTACTED KAPLAN UNIVERSITY. I FOUND IT PROTECTS. CONCERNING THE NEVER REVIEWED PREVIOUS COLLEGE TRANSCRIPTS. AND UPON YOU KNOW IN HINDSIGHT EVEN THOUGH I DID -- GO TO THE WHOLE PROCESS THEY NEVER -- REQUIRED. A PRE REQUISITE FOR EXAMPLE COLLEGE COMPOSITION. ARE THEY BASICALLY TAUGHT YOU HOW TO FRAME WORK IN RIGHT. BUT IT DIDN'T LEAVE ME WITH THE SKILLS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN A POSITION. IN A LAW OFFICE WHERE I WAS ABLE TO APPLY. YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA LAW TO FOR EXAMPLE WILL'S TRUST AND ESTATE PLANNING -- THAT IS ONE ISSUE THAT I FACED. THE OTHER ISSUE IS -- THE ONLINE PLATFORM FOR THE UNIVERSITY WAS CONSTANTLY CHANGING THERE WERE A TON OF TECHNICAL ISSUES. THERE WERE TIMES WHERE I WOULD TAKE AN EXAM. IT WOULD PHASE OUT I WOULD FEEL THE EXAM AND HAVE. TO GO THROUGH THIS WHOLE ARRAY OF OF EXPLAINING THE CIRCUMSTANCES AROUND THEIR TECHNOLOGY -- THE OTHER ASPECTS IS WITH OUR ONLINE LECTURES WE WERE FORCED TO BUY. PURCHASE COLLEGE MATERIAL. THAT THE PROFESSORS WOULD NOT EVEN LECTURE ON ON A ONE HOUR. HE YOU KNOW. EEK IN OAK PARK PLATFORM CAMPUS OR YOU KNOW -- LECTURE. SO -- THE OTHER PART OF MY EXPERIENCE WITH CAPTAIN IS -- THEY MADE IT SEEM THAT. I WOULD BE ABLE TO FULFILL MY GOALS AND TO BE ABLE TO HAVE PURSUED IN A CAREER IN PARALEGAL STUDIES BUT IN CALIFORNIA AND THERE WERE NO INTERNSHIP. OPPORTUNITIES. THERE WERE. A LOT OF STUDENTS THAT WERE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES THAT YOU WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH -- EVEN YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW FORMER STUDENTS SO -- IT REALLY FELT I REALLY FOUND ABANDONED WITH VERY LITTLE RESOURCES TO CONNECT IN THE COMMUNITY TO SAY HEY I HAVE THIS EDUCATION. THERE WAS NO NETWORKING OPPORTUNITIES. AND JUST -- TO JUST TO SUMMARIZE I BELIEVE. I'M GONNA STOP STOP. THE YEAR.

TERRACE ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. JUST A PART OF ME -- ON BEHALF OF HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. NO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ANY TWEETERS [inaudible] SEEING NONE. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] MISTER CHOI. THANK YOU CHAIR OF IT IMPRINTS PER. WOULD SUPPORT THE FEEL. BUT THE I A WOULD LIKE TO ASK US SOME TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. IS THIS -- BE A CONCERN NOT OUT OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO REPORT. INSTITUTION [inaudible] A SOLEMN. THE SCHOOL. OPERATING OUT OF STATE AND WOULD HAVE A BRANCH IN OUR STATE WHAT DO YOU MEAN. OUR ONLINE COLLEGES SO THESE ARE ONLINE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE BASED OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA BUT ARE SELLING THEIR SERVICES TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WERE. CHAINING THESE DEGREES ONLINE OKAY YEAH THE WAS SO WHAT I WAS -- THINKING IF THAT'S THE CASE AND HOW WOULD YOU ENFORCE IT FOR A THE SCHOOL OFFERS DEGREE IN FLORIDA. AND ANYBODY CAN AND REWARDED YOU CANNOT PREVENT THE STUDENTS ARE FROM ENROLLING. IN ONLINE COLLEGE OUT OF STATE. WE ENFORCE OUR LAWS TO ANY -- BUDDY WHO SELLING TO CALIFORNIANS IN ANYWAY RIGHT SO YOU KNOW AMAZON CAN'T COMMIT FRAUD HERE'S ANOTHER BASED IN SEATTLE BECAUSE THEY SELF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS OF THE SAME WOULD BE TRUE OF THESE INSTITUTIONS. I AM IN V.. ONLINE DEGREE OFFERING PROGRAM OR DEVELOPER -- TO ANYONE WHO HAS SO ONLINE ACCESS SAFE I SIGN UP. JUST. FOR MY BENEFIT AND THE SCHOOL IN FLORIDA OUT WOULD HAVE TO RE FUSE A SENSE SO WE ARE NOT AUTHORIZED. TO TWO OF ALL FOR THE PROGRAM TO YOU -- WAS A LIVING IN CALIFORNIA WE CANNOT ACCEPT YOU THEY HAVE TO REFUSE THAT THE ACCEPTING. YES TO ADD OUR CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY INSTITUTE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS SO -- WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS MAKE IT REALLY CLEAR? THAT UNLESS YOU REGISTERED. AND DID ALL THE KINDS OF SELF REPORTING THAT'S REQUIRED BY THE BILL. THEN YOU WOULD BE OFF IF YOU DID NOT DO THOSE THINGS YOU WOULD BE OPERATING HERE ILLEGALLY. NOW. THE ABILITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO GO AFTER PEOPLE WHO DO THINGS ILLEGALLY. IT'S REALLY NOT DIFFERENT WHETHER IT'S AN ONLINE COLLEGE HEADQUARTERED. IN SOUTH DAKOTA. GETS OFFERING THINGS ILLEGALLY HERE OR IF MY MOM WHO IS NOT A LAWYER. DECIDES TO START PRACTICING LAW. THE REMEDIES THAT THE INTERNET GENERAL HAS TO STOP THOSE THINGS. ARE COURT ORDERS IN JUNCTIONS IT'S THE SAME THING SO WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS FEAR AN OUT OF STATE. COMPANY. AND A HEADQUARTERS IN WISCONSIN. AND THROUGH THE WEB YOU'RE SELLING HERE. AND YOU'RE NOT REGISTERED. YOU WOULD BE OPERATING ILLEGALLY. SOME PEOPLE MAY CHOOSE TO OPERATE ILLEGALLY BUT IN ORDER TO CATCH THEM OPERATING ILLEGALLY SO AFTER A FEW DAYS UPON THE APPLICANT THAT THEY HAVE TO READ A SELF MONITOR WITH HIS -- WITH HIS CHILDREN IS COMING FROM IT YEAH THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT EXISTING LAW DOES ALREADY REQUIRE A REGISTRATION PROCESS THAT IS ALREADY EMBODIED IN EXISTING LOT THIS WOULD SIMPLY IMPROVE THE REGISTRATION PROCESS AND AT SEVERAL KEY PROTECTIONS TO THE EXISTING REGISTRATION PROCESS. BUT IT THE STATE DOES HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO CREATE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY BUSINESS TO OPERATE AND TO SELL ITS WARES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EDUCATION IS NO DIFFERENT -- AS AD AND USED TO THE GREAT LAWYER EXAMPLE AND YOU HAVE TO BE YOU HAVE TO BE BARRED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BY THE BAR. OF CALIFORNIA IN ORDER TO OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA AND SO YOU DO THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER AREAS WHERE THIS IS ALREADY A REQUIREMENT THERE ARE LOTS OF PARALLELS. SO YES THAT'S EXACTLY CORRECT. AMONG THE FIVE ITEMS SO THEY ARE I SEE -- ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE -- ON WHEN THE BUREAU ON NONPROFIT THE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION B. P. P.. A RECEIVE SO THIS FIVE DOCUMENTS. CAN THEY MAKE A JUDGMENT THAT THEY FINANCIAL STABILITY. WHETHER THAT THE SCHOOL OR SUSTAIN THOUGH WOULD LOCK WILL NOT CLOSE NEXT YEAR. SO RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO INFORMATION ON THAT PROVIDED -- THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE SOME SELF REPORTING ON ANY ON SEVERAL INDICATORS OF RED FLAGS PROBLEMS AT THE SCHOOL WHETHER THEY'RE UNDER INVESTIGATION WHETHER THEY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THEIR ACCREDITATION -- WHETHER THE STATE OR FEDERAL EDGE AGENCY IS LOOKING INTO ISSUES AT THE SCHOOL -- THEIR FINANCIAL THAT STABILITY SCORE WHICH IS WHICH IS OF COURSE NOT ONE OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS -- BUT THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD INDICATE RISK STUDENTS THAT ARE INCLUDED. YEAH THESE THESE ARE -- GOOD THE MANAGER SAID TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STUDENTS WERE NOT BECOME A VICTIM THAT ALONE. BECAUSE I HAD AN EXPERIENCE -- KNOWS SOMEBODY. THE TWO STUDENTS ARE COMING FROM I BELIEVE THE NAME WAS A SOUTHWESTERN LAW SCHOOL IN. LOS ANGELES THAT THEY WERE PURCHASED A PIE HI HERE -- LEVEL CORPORATION. AND THE SCHOOL WAS SO GOING VERY WELL BUT ONE OF THE THE BRANCHES SELECT ART SCHOOL IF THEY PURCHASED A LAW SCHOOL WAS DOING WELL BUT OUR SCHOOL YOUR FAVORITE DOES SO WELL. THE MONEY THEY WERE MAKING MORE MAKING UP BY IN THE COULD NOT HANDLE THE ENTIRE SITUATION AND THAT THEY CUT UP. OF BANKRUPTCY AND THE STUDENTS IN THE MIDDLE BECAME THE VICTIM SO THAT'S WHY. I WONDERED. WHY NOT TELL YOU IT DID NOT REQUIRE SPECIFICALLY FINANCIAL -- DOES SOUND SOUNDED NEZ SO OR DID THE FULL TOWARD. PROFITABILITY -- YEAH NO I THINK YOU RAISE AN IMPORTANT POINT MISTER CHOI AND WE'LL LOOK AT THAT GOING FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK IT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT HELP FURTHER PROTECT CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE -- SEEING NONE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR EITHER.

THAT ALLOWS FOR SOME FLEXIBILITY IN OUR STATE. SUCH A THREE DEADLINES FOR FINANCIAL AID APPLICATIONS WHEN THERE'S BEEN AN EVENT SUCH AS A NATURAL DISASTER OR A STATE OF EMERGENCY SO I MEAN THAT'S OUT OF THE CONTROL OF THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES. THAT MAY INHIBIT THEIR ABILITY TO MEET THE MARCH SECOND DEADLINE WE HAVE FOR OUR CAL GRANT AND OTHER STATE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS THIS BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE THE COMMISSION TO EXTEND THE DEADLINE. BUT AFTER THIRTY DAYS THE EVENT OF SUCH AN EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCE -- WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT A PRESET THE AUTHOR'S EFFORTS AND LEADERSHIP ON THIS AND LOOK FORWARD TO LOOK FOR CONFIRMING THE BILL THANK YOU. HOW MANY OF SKY JACKSON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND AS I MENTIONED BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT THIS IS A VERY LOW COST AND COMMON SENSE APPROACH? THAT HELPS STUDENTS AND FAMILIES REMOVE ADMINISTRATIVE BEARS ACCESS COLLEGE FUNDS DURING A TIME WHEN THEY ACTUALLY NEEDED THE MOST. THE DEPARTMENT SUPPORTS -- SIX MILLION -- STUDENTS AND FAMILIES -- TO BE READY FOR COLLEGE AND AND CAREER -- FOR MANY OF THESE FAMILIES IT'S A FIRST IN MULTIPLE GENERATION OPPORTUNITY TO GET INTO COLLEGE AND WE KNOW THAT FOR THOSE FAMILIES AND STUDENTS POSTURE IN COLLEGE. THAT -- FISCAL RESOURCES SHOULD NOT BE A BARRIER IN ADMINISTRATIVE BEAR SHOULD NOT SHUT THE DOOR ON THEM -- AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FOUR WILL HELP REMOVE THOSE ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS TO IN A TIME WHEN THEY NEEDED AS OUTLINED IN IN THE BILL AS MENTIONED BY SIMPLY MEMBER BOND SO WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD.

THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS. GOVERNMENTS ARE -- GROUP -- YOU QUICK CABBIE I ACTUALLY REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING I'M HERE AT THE INVITATION OF GOLDEN WEST COLLEGE. A LEATHER THROUGHOUT A FEW OTHER DISCLAIMERS I I WORK FOR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH THERE FOR I'M NOT IN A POSITION TO TAKE A POSITION ON THIS BILL. BUT I CAN OFFER SOME SOME TALKING POINTS THAT WILL HELP ILLUSTRATE. THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ISSUE AND THE ADVANTAGES THAT THAT THE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND POST HALF. AS OF RESPECT -- OFFERS PUBLIC SAFETY -- THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES CALIFORNIA IN THE COMMISSION OF PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING THE THE BASIC ACADEMIES AND ALL THE TRAINING ENJOYED MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL RELATIONSHIP. THAT HAS CREATED A STANDARD WHERE -- HE'S ALSO TRAINING IN STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS THE GOLD STANDARD. THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE AFFORDED BY THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE SPECIFICALLY TO FOLD. FIRST OF ALL IT GIVES THOSE ENTRY LEVEL OFFICERS AND PUBLIC OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY MEMBERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN COLLEGE CREDITS AS THEY MOVE FORWARD IN THEIR CAREERS. MORE IMPORTANTLY THOSE FULL TIME EQUIVALENCY -- MONIES ARE F. T. E.'S. PROVIDE A SUBSTANTIAL OFFSET TO THE COSTS FOR A PERSON TO GO INTO THE BASIC ACADEMY. SO WITH RESPECT TO THAT CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW IT COSTS A NON APHELIA CELL SPONSORED STUDENT ABOUT THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED MAYBE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GO TO AND ACADEMY. THERE'S A LOT OF OUR APPLICANTS THAT PROBABLY DON'T HAVE TWO NICKELS TO RUB TOGETHER LET ALONE THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. THOSE F. T. D.'S FD CERTAINLY DO OFFSET SOME OF THOSE COSTS. THE ADVANTAGE OF THAT IT IS ALLOWS A LOT OF PEOPLE TO COME INTO THE PROFESSION. THE REALITY IS LAW ENFORCEMENT IS A GATEWAY PROFESSION INTO THE AMERICAN DREAM WE HAVE -- A LOT OF FUTURE POLICE OFFICERS AND I WOULD IMAGINE FIREFIGHTERS THAT COME FROM. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES DISADVANTAGE FINANCIAL BACKGROUNDS IN THE CERTAINLY FORT THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE THAT AMERICAN DREAM AND MOVE FORWARD AS THEY THEY MOVE FORWARD INTO THEIR RESPECTIVE CAREERS. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR INVITING ME TO TESTIFY IN THIS MATTER. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

AT RIVERSIDE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR THIRTEEN YEARS WHERE WE HAVE A VERY SUCCESSFUL FIRE ACADEMY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ACADEMY. I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THESE ARE TWO COMMUNITIES OF BOTH -- FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIREFIGHTING SO I'M VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. AND IN FACT THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD -- SECRETARY READ PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEDINA HI MALINA HI CHARLIE. CHOI I GLORIA. GLORIA I BLOOM. I GABRIEL -- WHEN [inaudible] KYLIE [inaudible] GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I LOW PATTERSON SANTIAGO WEBER WEBBER I SIX ZERO WILL LEAVE THE BILL ON CALL FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. AND NEXT I WILL GO TO ITEM SEVENTEEN DR WEBBER [inaudible] THE SECOND. AND THIS BILL DOES ENJOY SUPPORT SUPPORT RIGHT. SO WE'LL BE FREE THAT'S HOW. WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING US AT THIS TIME -- I HAVE SOME. OF EXPERT WITNESSES HERE WHO HAVE PLANES TO GET SO I APPRECIATE THAT -- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY I HAVE THE PLEASURE PRESENTING AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY SEVEN WHICH WOULD CHANGE ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS SO THE CREW DEVELOPMENT IN COLLEGE PREPARATION NON CREDIT COURSES. THAT HAVE A DEFINITE DEFINITIVE END DATE WOULD ALSO ALSO KNOWN AS MANAGING MOMENT CAN ARE FUNDED PER FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENT BASED ON EXPENSES DATE. UNDER CURRENT LAW NON CREDIT COURSES INCLUDING NON CREDIT CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND COLLEGE PREPARATION COURSES ARE FUNDED BASED ON A POSITIVE ATTENDANCE. POSITIVE ATTENDANCE IS BASED ON ACTUAL COUNTING OF ENROLL STUDENTS PRESENT AT EACH CLASS MEETING. THESE OPEN ENTRY OPEN EXIT WITHIN EIGHT IT WOULD ENABLE STUDENTS TO MOVE IN AND OUT OF CLASSES ON THEIR ABILITY TO MASTER CERTAIN COURSE MATERIALS. THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM CREDIT COURSES COURSES WHICH ARE FUNDED BASED ON A CENSUS DATE. MANAGING ROMAN COURSES WHICH HAVE A DEFINITIVE START AND END DATE HAVE BECOME MORE THE NORM FOR CDC P. NONCREDIT COURSES AS THEY HAVE SHOWN TO INCREASE STUDENT RETENTION AND SUCCESS. SEVERAL COLLEGES HAVE DEMONSTRATED ACADEMIC BENEFIT OF MANAGING MOMENT COURSES TO INSTRUCTIONAL RESEARCH. THESE BENEFITS INCLUDE INCREASED TO AN ATTENDANCE 43% FOR MANAGING ROLLED WENT VERSUS 33% FOR OPEN ENTRY AND OPEN EXIT COURSES. THIS WOULD BETTER EQUALIZE FUNDING FOR NON CREDIT CDC. SEE THE CP COURSES THAT ARE OFFERED WHAT THEY STARTED IN DATE MENACING MOMENT BY AUTHORIZING THE ATTENDANCE OF THOSE COURSES TO BE TAKEN ACCORDING TO A CENSUS DATE. RATHER THAN ON POSITIVE ATTENDANCE. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL WOULD FREE UP PRECIOUS FACULTY TIMES OF THE FACULTY CAN BETTER ADDRESS LEARNING NEEDS OF STUDENTS LEAN TO EVEN GREATER STUDENT SUCCESS. THE LATEST SET OF AMENDMENTS CLARIFIES IT BOTH FACE TO FACE AND DISTANCE EDUCATION INSTRUCTIONAL METHODS ARE INCLUDED. NONCREDIT DISTANCE COURSES SCORE EDUCATION IS GAINING MOMENTUM AND THESE COURSES ARE TYPICALLY COMPETENCY BASE WITH STEWED STUDENTS GAINING SKILLS CERTIFICATION AND COMPETENCIES WITHIN A SHORT OF SHORT TERM FLEXIBLE SCHEDULING STRUCTURE. THE CURRENT ATTENDANCE MODEL DOES NOT SUPPORT THIS MODE OF INSTRUCTION INSTRUCTION IF WAS IMPORTANT CLARIFIED DISTANCE EDUCATION IS INCLUDED. THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY SAN DIEGO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT THE ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY AND CONTINUING EDUCATION AND SAN FRANCISCO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT AND HAS NO OPPOSITION. HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AND ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS FOR AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY SEVEN IS CARLOS -- TEARS FROM THE SAND HILL COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT AND VALENTINO PURTELL FROM THE NORTH ORANGE COUNTY CONTINUING EDUCATION. GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR CARLESS TURNER CORTEZ THE PRESIDENT OF SAN DIEGO CONTINUING EDUCATION JUST TO PROVIDE ONE POINT OF CLARIFICATION UNLIKE EIGHTY EIGHT IN THE K. TWELVE SETTING WHERE YOU CONSTANT ATTENDANCE ONCE PER DAY. AND THE A POSITIVE ATTENDANCE FOR ADULT EDUCATION YOU HAVE TO COUNT STUDENTS IN FIFTEEN MINUTE INTERVALS IMAGINE THE WORKLOAD THAT THAT CREATES FOR FACULTY -- WHEN THE WHEN THE ASSEMBLY OF SUPPORTED CDC P. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN THEY DID SO IN THE HOPES THAT WE WOULD EXPAND ESL HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA? A SHORT TERM INTENSIVE CAREER EDUCATION FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY IMMIGRANTS REFUGEES AND THE UNDER SERVED UNDER EDUCATED. UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE NOT SEEN AN EXPANSION OF CD C. P. COURSES OVER THE PAST DECADE BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE TAKE ATTENDANCE IN THESE COURSES. AT THE COLLEGE IS WE TAKE ATTENDANCE TWICE PER TERM WHICH ALLOWS INSTRUCTORS TO TEACH A CURRICULUM THAT SEQUENTIAL. THE OPEN ENTRY OPEN EXIT MODEL THAT HISTORICALLY IS CHARACTERIZED ADULT EDUCATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MEANS THAT STUDENTS COME AND GO AS THEY PLEASE. FROM A PEDAGOGICAL ARE AND YOU'RE GOOD TO GO PERSPECTIVE IT'S ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO TEACH A SET OF SKILLS UNLESS YOU CAN TEACH SKILLS THAT BUILD UPON THEMSELVES IN AUTO PROGRAM AT A CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM AT A COATING PROGRAM. IN A NURSING PROGRAM THEREFORE WE'RE HERE TODAY TO URGE YOU TO SUPPORT A CHANGE IN HOW WE TAKE ATTENDANCE IN ADULTS NONCREDIT EDUCATION IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGE JUST TO DISSENT IS BASED APPORTIONMENT. ALSO IN ADDITION THE NEW STUDENT SUCCESS FUNDING FORMULA IS INCENTIVIZING COLLEGES TO ELIMINATE PRE TRANSFER ENGLISH AND MATH THE REALITY IS MANY STUDENTS CAN'T SUCCEED IN TRANSFER LEVEL ENGLISH A MAP. UNLESS THEY ALSO HAVE THE SUPPORTS REMEDIATION THAT WORKING NEEDS TO MOVE IT WILL MOVE TO NON CREDIT. IT WILL NOT MOVE TONIGHT CREDIT HOWEVER UNLESS WE CHANGE THE ATTENDANCE FORMULA BECAUSE MANY DISTRICTS ARE JUST INCENTIVIZED TO DO SO. AND LASTLY -- WITH RESPECT TO THE ONLINE COLLEGE MY COLLEAGUE FROM NORTH ORANGE COUNTY WILL SPEAK TO A JUST A MOMENT THE ONLINE COLLEGE IS ATTEMPTING TO REACH A PARTICULAR POPULATION TO ACHIEVE CERTAIN ENDS. THAT'S WHAT WE DO IN ADULTS NONCREDIT EDUCATION IF WE WANT TO HAVE A BIGGER BANG FOR OUR BUCK IN REACHING ADULT LEARNERS THE WAY TO DO SO IS WAS THAT DEVICE COLLEGES TO EXPAND CDC P. NONCREDIT PROGRAMMING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER WERE SO GRATEFUL TO HAVE YOU IN SAN DIEGO. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS VALENTINA PURTELL AND I'M THE PROVOST OF NORTH ORANGE CONTINUING EDUCATION I'M ALSO THE LEGISLATIVE LIAISON FOR THE BOARD OF ASSOCIATION OF CONTINUING AND COMMUNITY EDUCATION. WHICH IS A CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL -- MY COLLEAGUE FOCUSED IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE BILL I JUST WANT TO ADD WHY THE BILL IF PASSED WILL INCENTIVIZE COLLEGES TO OFFER MORE DISTANCE EDUCATION. ONLINE NONCREDIT OFFERINGS -- TRADITIONALLY NON CREDIT SERVICE ON TRADITIONAL STUDENT POPULATIONS AND THAT MEANS TYPICALLY OLDER STUDENTS WAS MANY WORK AND FAMILY PRIORITIES. THOSE THAT SOMETIMES CAN NOT COMMITTED TO IN PERSON STUDIES AND NEED AN ABILITY -- TO STUDY EITHER FROM THEIR HOME OR EVEN WORKPLACE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PERCENTAGE OF ONLINE OFFERINGS FOR NON CREDIT IS VERY LOW RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE. IN COMPARISON TO THAT OF CREDIT YET WE PROVIDE COMPETENCY BASED FLEXIBLE EDUCATION THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE THE ATTENDANCE COLLECTING FORMALIZE VERY CUMBERSOME FOR ONLINE NONCREDIT OFFERINGS. IT IS SENSES BASED BUT IT REQUIRES TWO SENSES DATES SO WE HAVE TO MEASURE ATTENDANCE AT THE BEGINNING AND AT THE END OF THE TERM THAT WE HAVE TO AVERAGE IT OUT. AND MULTIPLIED BY THE LENGTH OF THE TERM SO -- IT'S VERY CUMBERSOME LABOR INTENSIVE AND FOR MANY COLLEGES IT REQUIRES CREATION OF A PARALLEL AND SEPARATE SYSTEM AND NOT MANY COLLEGES HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO SO. I WILL STOP RIGHT HERE -- WE'RE JUST VERY EXCITED -- TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT RIGHT. RIGHT WING IN THE MILITARY IS. ASHLEY WALKER WITH ANNOUNCEMENT ON BEHALF OF MOUNT SAN ANTONIO COLLEGE AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU MARK MCDONALD ON BEHALF OF THE FOOT HILLS THE ANZA PERALTA AND SAN FRANCISCO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS AND SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ANY WINNERS. ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. DR WEBBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL. I JUST A COMMENT -- WITNESS THE FIRST WITNESS -- REFERENCE THE WAY K. TWELVE TAKES ATTENDANCE AND USUALLY YES K. TWELVE TEACHERS TAKE ATTENDANCE ONCE A DAY -- EASY. BUT SUMMER SCHOOL SUMMER SCHOOL. WITH POSITIVE. ATTENDANCE FOUR TIMES A DAY. FOR THIRTY SIX STUDENTS BY HAND ON A SCANNED SHE PROBABLY NOT THE BEST WAY USE OF INSTRUCTIONAL TIME WE'RE TEACHERS TIME THIS SEEMS LIKE A SIMILAR -- FIX HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL SO. MOVED BY MS GONZALEZ FLETCHER SECOND BY MISTER GLORIA MEMSIC INTERVIEW PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS DO PASSED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE MEDINA. MEDINA I CHOI. CHOICE I GLORIA. GLORIA I BLOOM. BLOOM I GABRIEL. GABRIEL I WHEN -- WHEN I KYLIE GONZALEZ? GONZALEZ I LOW [inaudible] PATTERSON SANTIAGO WEBER. WEBBER HI. EIGHT ZERO BILL IS OUT. WE'LL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. CARLOS WITH. WHOM THE ROOM HAS OF THE OKAY BLOOM. MISTER BLOOM ITM FOR A. B. EIGHT TO NINE AND SAY WHEN THE STRUCTURE. YOU MAY BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AB EIGHT TO NINE PERMITS THE C. S. USED TO AWARD DOCTORATE DEGREES IN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY TO COMPLY. WITH THE CHANGING PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS AND ENSURE THAT. ENSURE THE CONTINUATION OF THESE PROGRAMS -- TEASE WORK WITH PEOPLE OF ALL AGES AND CONDITIONS TO ENHANCE THEIR ABILITY TO PERFORM DAILY ACTIVITIES -- TEAS LIKE MY WIFE'S SUPPORT CHILDREN WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES PEOPLE RECOVERING FROM INJURIES AND OLDER ADULTS EXPERIENCING COGNITIVE OR PHYSICAL CHANGES. AND WHILE -- TEES OFF FOR NECESSARY SUPPORT FOR MANY TO HAVE A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE. UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA RANKS FORTY FOURTH IN THE NATION IN ACCESS TO OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS WERE ALSO HOME TO ONLY 8% OF TEAS WHILE HAVING 12% OF THE US POPULATION. AND SO AS WITH MANY HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONS CALIFORNIA ALSO HAS A CLEAR SHORTAGE OF TEASE. NOW THE ACCREDITATION COUNCIL -- FOR TEASE RECENTLY TOOK STEPS TO SHIFT THEIR CERTIFICATION ENTRY FROM A MASTER'S DEGREE TO A DOCTOR DOCTORATE LEVEL DEGREE. AND WITHOUT THE AUTHORITY TO TRANSITION OUR PROGRAMS TO DOCTOR AT LEVEL PROGRAMS THE CURRENT -- T. PROGRAMS AT SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY AND CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS WOULD NO LONGER MEET ACCREDITATION STANDARDS AND WOULD BE FORCED TO SHUT DOWN. WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. UNDER THEIR SERVICE LEARNING MODELS TO CS YOU PROGRAMS PARTNER WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY CENTERS AND REHABILITATION CLINICS TO PROVIDE FREE AND LOW COST SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE THOSE. SERVICES WITH THE PROJECTED GROWTH IN EMPLOYMENT BY 24% OUR ABILITY TO OFFER THESE PUBLIC PROGRAMS WOULD GREATLY IMPACT THE SUPPLY OF HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER. HEALTH CARE SPECIALISTS TO SPEAK MORE ON THE NEED FOR THE BILL AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I HAVE -- WITH ME THE INTERIM DEAN OF THE COLLEGE OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SCIENCE. AT SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY AND THE CS YOU SYSTEMS INTERIM ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR OF ACADEMIC PROGRAMS AND FACULTY DEVELOPMENT I HOPE I GOT THAT RIGHT. HI MAGGIE WAY AND WITH THE CSU SYSTEM OF MY COLLEAGUE IN THE AUDIENCE HAS THE MUCH FANCIER IN LONGER TITLE. I HAPPY TO BE HERE VERY EXCITED I THIS IS ONE OF TWO SPONSORED BILLS PIRACY AS YOU BOARD OF TRUSTEES. HI MY NAME IS MAGGIE WHY I'M A LET'S LEAVE ADVOCATE WITH THE SYSTEM HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUE IN THE AUDIENCE. AT WILL NOW BE TURNING IT OVER TO DR PAM RICHARDSON TO MY LEFT WILL BE PROVIDING HER PERSPECTIVE AS AN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST FORMER FACULTY MEMBER NOW PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR AT TENNESSEE STATE. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME'S PAMELA PAMELA RICHARDSON AND I MEAN -- DEAN OF THE COLLEGE OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SCIENCES IT'S HANDS IT STATE UNIVERSITY AND ALSO AN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. I'VE BEEN ON THE FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATION IT SENDS A STATE FOR OVER TWENTY ONE YEARS INVOLVED WITH THE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY PROGRAM. AS REFLECTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS A CS YOU HAS THE ONLY PUBLIC PATH TO A CAREER IN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY IN THE STATE. AND BETWEEN OUR TWO PROGRAMS AT SAN JOSE AND DOMINGUEZ HILLS WE CURRENTLY GRADUATE 30% OF THE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST EDUCATED IN CALIFORNIA. NATIONALLY ACCREDITATION STANDARDS ARE INCREASING AND THE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY PROFESSION IS CHANGING. CONSEQUENTLY SEVENTY SIX OF THE NINETY SIX TOTAL OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY MASTER'S DEGREE PROGRAMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSITIONING TO A DOCTORATE DEGREE IN PREPARATION FOR THE PROFESSIONAL DEMAND. FOR DOCTORAL LEVEL EDUCATION. IN CALIFORNIA ALL OF THE PRIVATE PROGRAMS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF OR IF ALREADY TRANSITION TO A DOCTORATE LEVEL EDUCATION AS WELL. CALIFORNIA STUDENTS NEED A PUBLIC OPTION FOR OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY DOCTORAL PROGRAMS. I CAN SPEAK FOR US AND AS A STATE STUDENTS WHO ARE VERY SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS WHO ARE VERY CONNECTED TO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN HEALTH CARE AND HEALTH CARE ACCESS TO PEOPLE ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THEY DESERVE TO HAVE A DOCTOR LEVEL EDUCATION THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO BE LEADERS IN CHANGING HEALTH CARE IN CALIFORNIA THIS TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. THE AUTHORITY WOULD PROVIDE CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS WITH PUBLIC UNIVERSITY OPTIONS TO ADVANCE OUR OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY EDUCATION AND TRAINING SO THEY DO NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN. ONLY PRIVATE SCHOOLS OR OUT OF STATE OPTIONS THE COST OF TUITION AT CALIFORNIA'S PRIVATE MASTER'S PROGRAMS IN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY. RANGES FROM EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE THOUSAND AT C. S. U. THE TOTAL COST OF TUITION FOR TWO AND A HALF YEAR. MASTER'S PROGRAMS IS ROUGHLY. NINETEEN THOUSAND WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE DOCTOR DEGREE WOULD CONTINUE TO BRING SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS TO OUR STUDENTS. WE'RE PROUD THAT OUR GRADUATION RATES EXCEED 95% AND OUR GRADUATES HAVE A 97% PASS RATE ON NATIONAL CERTIFICATION EXAMINATION WHICH ALIGNS WITH THE SUCCESS RATES OF THE STATE'S PRIVATE PROGRAMS. ARE PROGRAMS PREPARE PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE READY TO JUMP INTO THE WORK FORCE WITH HANDS ON EXPERIENCE FROM THERE MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND HOURS. OF FIELD WORK IN HOSPITALS SCHOOLS ON CAMPUS CLINICS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS WHERE THEY PROVIDE SERVICES TO ENABLE PEOPLE OF ALL AGES INCOMES AND ABILITY LEVELS. TO LIVE SAFE PRODUCTIVE AND HEALTHY LIVES. THE DOCTOR A LITTLE PROGRAM WITH BILL ON THE GREAT SUCCESS OF OUR MASTERS LEVEL PROGRAMS IN THE VITAL COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS. THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED OVER SEVENTY FIVE YEARS AT SAN JOSE STATE AND TWENTY YEARS AT DOMINGUEZ HILLS. THIS IS WHY ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT KAISER PERMANENTE HEY THE CENTER FOR ELDERS INDEPENDENCE IN MANY OTHER SUPPORT THIS BILL. THEY AND I KNOW THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE HARD WORKING HIGHLY SKILLED AND EAGER TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR COMMUNITIES WE'RE VERY PROUD OFFERING AFFORDABLE PUBLIC PATH. TO CAREER IN THIS IMPORTANT HEALTH CARE FIELD THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. I'VE BEEN ALL TOMORROW ON BEHALF OF THE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. WHEN OFFICIALS CROWN CHERUB PROFESSOR AT SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST FOR FORTY YEARS AND I'M IN SUPPORT? ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ANY TWEETERS. SCENE.

ADVANCED -- US -- THIRTY INTO PROFESSION WOULD BE A GOOD THING BUT THE I'M JUST CARRIERS SO. SINCE YOU DO HAVE A MASTER'S DEGREE IN THEM MY MOST CASES A DOCTORATE DEGREE SOME MORE ACADEMIC RESEARCH AND TEACHING -- WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF FOR THIS -- DOCTORATE DEGREE IS -- OF VANS TO SKIERS SO OR TO PRODUCE SO ACADEMIC -- OF FUTURE -- FOR FACULTY MEMBERS. WHAT A DEAL A TWO MONTH THE PURPOSE OF WHAT NEED FOR THIS DOCTOR DEGREES OF NO THAT'S NOT FUN QUESTION IT'S ACTUALLY CLINICAL DOCTORATE SO IT'S DIFFERENT THAN A PHD WHICH IS A RESEARCH DOCTORATE? IT'S A CLINICAL DOCTOR DEGREES IN FIELDS LIKE NURSING PHYSICAL THERAPY AUDIOLOGY ARE PREPARING PRACTITIONERS TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE -- AT AT HIGHER LEVELS LEADERSHIP -- MANAGEMENT SKILLS SO IT'S IT'S WHAT'S CALLED AN APPLIED DEGREE OR CLINICAL DEGREE SO THE FOCUS IS MORE ON ADVANCED CLINICAL SKILLS IN CLINICAL APPLICATION RATHER THAN SIMPLY CONDUCTING RESEARCH PER SE. SO SO A KARNATAK OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST A WITH A MASTER'S DEGREE AT THEY ARE THE PEOPLE IN THE FRONT AND I AND INTERACTING WITH THE CUSTOMERS AND THE WITH THE ADVANCES DEGREE THERE WILL BE CONTINUING IN THE CLINICAL SETTING. YES CORRECT I SEE AND THEN THEY WOULD BE MORE OF INTO POSITION. ON TO TEACH MAYBE PART OF SO IN COMING. UP OR THE RESIDENT SAYS SOURCE SPEAKER IN THE BEGINNING CAREER IS THAT THE PROPOSED.

THE CLINICAL PRACTICE STANDARDS IT PROVIDES HIGHER LEVELS OF SORT OF ANALYSIS AND USE OF RESEARCH DATA AND ALSO -- KIND OF LEADERSHIP ABILITIES MANAGEMENT TO TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO TAKE MORE LEADERSHIP POSITIONS IN HEALTHCARE. NO ONE OFFICE OF ADVANTAGE OF FOR T. HOW WITH THAT HER DOCTOR DEGREE YOU WOULD BE -- LIKE A HOSPITAL SETTING AND THEY CAME IN AND THEY CAN BE A PREFERRED THAT SAID DR.

ANY ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE ANY TWEETERS. COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THIS LED AN A I HAVE A QUESTION -- I BELIEVE THIS MOVES TO APPROPRIATIONS. ACT. IN THAT MOVEMENT I'D LIKE A YOU I I'M NOT GOING TO OFFER IT AS A CONDITION OF OF THE MOTION BUT I'D LIKE TO KNOW MISTER KYLIE IF YOU WOULD ADD A PROVISION TO ENSURE. THAT OUR UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS KNOW THAT THEY ALSO HAVE A RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH WITHOUT RETALIATION OF ANYONE CALLING IMMIGRATION SERVICES ARE I NASSER -- KIND OF ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT I I'D LIKE THAT PLACED IN THE BILL SO THAT WE INSURE THAT OUR UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS WHO OFTEN TAKE. REALLY BRAVE STANCES ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES CAN DO SO WITHOUT FEAR OF RETALIATION ARE YOU WILLING TO ADD THAT IN YOUR BILLS AT MOST THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY BILL THIS IS -- AND IT'S ALL RIGHT I'M SORRY I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE -- LONGER THAN A YEAR OKAY -- JUST SO I CAN CLEAR FIND THIS WHAT WHAT YOU'RE ASKING IS IS FOR THEM. TO WRITE A DOCUMENT MAKE A STATEMENT PUBLIC I MEAN WHAT ARE THEY TO DO I'D MOST CAMPUSES HAVE SOME POLICY SOMEWHERE WRITTEN. ON FREE FOURTH ONE FREE SPEECH SO. WHAT ARE YOU ASKING OF THEM TO DO THIS DIFFERENT YES WE HAVE ON A COUPLE EXAMPLES THAT ARE CITED IN THE RESOLUTION THAT WE ALL PASSED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT ARE ALSO -- PRINTED IN FULL AS PART OF THIS BILL -- ONE IS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO THEY PUT OUT A A FREE SPEECH STATEMENT -- THAT -- WAS THE PRODUCT OF YET A LOT OF WORK ON THE PART OF CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS -- THEY JUST SETS FORTH THE IMPORTANCE OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH ON THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS AND THE ROLE OF THE UNIVERSITY AND BEING PROMOTING A DIVERSE -- YOU KNOW MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS AND THEN WE ALSO INCLUDE A SIMILAR STATEMENT PUT OUT BY THE CHANCELLOR OF THE UC IRVINE WHO'S ACTUALLY HIMSELF WORK WITH US -- ON THIS LEGISLATION AND THAT YOU KNOW YOU SEE BERKELEY HAS ALSO IN -- THE LAST COUPLE YEARS ADOPTED A SIMILAR STATEMENT SO -- WE USE THOSE AS MODELS ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW THERE FOR UNIVERSITIES ARE FREE TO CRAFT THEM -- AS THEY SEE FIT AND THIS WILL BE A MANDATE FOR EVERY CAMPUS TO DEVELOP A POLICY. RATHER THAN ACCEPTING THE U. C.'S POLICY OR THE C. ISSUES POLICY. IT'S ONE TO WRITE A DIFFERENT POLICY OR JUST SIMPLY ACCEPT THE UNIVERSITY'S POLICIES WHAT IT WHAT ARE THEY DOING IS IT. EVERY CAMPUS RIGHT THE POLICY OR THE C. IF YOU WRITE A POLICY FOR ALL FOR THE SYSTEM YEAH SO EVERY CAMPUS COULD HAVE ITS OWN -- ALTHOUGH CERTAINLY YOU KNOW YOU COULD HAVE -- THE THE SAME STATEMENT USED MULTIPLE CAMPUSES. SO BASICALLY WE JUST REQUIRING THEM TO DO A STATEMENT. THAT'S RIGHT OKAY FOR EACH CAMPUS AND AND WE DID THAT BEFORE TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE DID A RESOLUTION -- THAT ENCOURAGED CAMPUSES DEDUCE ON SOME HAVE IN FACT -- DONE JUST THAT AS I MENTIONED UC BERKELEY THE OTHER ONES RESOLUTION NOW WE ACTUALLY MOVED TO WRITE THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH STATEMENT THAT'S RIGHT AND THIS BILL ACTUALLY I PASSED -- IN A SIMILAR -- SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE UNANIMOUSLY OKAY AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED TO IT -- APPROPRIATIONS OKAY -- AND AND YOU HAD DIFFICULTY WITH WAS GONZALEZ'S REQUESTED. BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND I'M I WAS IN FAVOR OF THIS UNTIL ALL THAT STARTED BUT SEEM TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH WOULD WOULD MAKE SCULLY ONE OF THE THINGS WE WOULD TRY TO GUARANTEE IS THAT THOSE WHO EXPRESS THEMSELVES WOULD NOT. SUFFER ANY RETALIATION AS A RESULT OF WHAT THEY EXPRESS I MEAN. THAT'S GENERALLY THE CONCEPT OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH OTHERWISE IT'S NOT FREE IS IS THERE. THE COURT I I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT ALL RIGHT THE CONTROVERSY IS SO I'M NOT I'M NOT SURE -- EXACTLY WHAT MS GONZALEZ WAS ASKING FOR BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T SAY. RETALIATION BY WHO OR RIGHT NOW IF YOU'RE ON THE CAMPUS I BELIEVE YOU'RE PROTECTED. WITH THE DC MINISTRATION ALLOWED WHO WHO DO YOU WANT TO PROTECT. THAT'S THE QUESTION FOR ME I WANT TO PROTECT UNDOCUMENTED UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS WHO WE INVITE ONTO OUR CAMPUSES TO FEEL THAT THEY ALSO HAVE THE THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS. IS PUT OUT THERE -- I I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S CONTROVERSIAL DON'T WE ALREADY HAVE LAWS THAT AFFECT WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION. DON'T THEY HAVE TO RESPECT THE RIGHTS FOR OF THE I I KNOW IT'S AT LEAST POLICY. THAT THEY RESPECT THAT SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO YOUR WE ALREADY HAVE A WORRIED ABOUT WE ALREADY HAVE THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS WELL WHAT I WANT TO ENSURE IS THAT THESE STUDENTS. WHO -- WHO MIGHT FEEL INTIMIDATED OTHERWISE IT ESPECIALLY GIVEN AT THE KIND OF GROUPS WHO ARE PRESSING FOR THIS? NEW STEP THAT THAT IT IS ALREADY RESTATING LAW THAT THEY ALSO FEEL PROTECTED BECAUSE I I WOULD. I BE CONCERNED THAT THEY GIVE IN THE GENESIS OF OF THIS NEW PROFOUND MOVEMENT THAT WE HAVE -- SOME STUDENTS WHO DO NOT FEEL WELCOME ON CAMPUS AND WON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS SPECIFICALLY ALSO OUTLINED FOR THEM BUT SO ARE YOU ASKING THAT THERE BE A STATEMENT LIKE THIS. INCLUDED IN WHAT WE RE CREST THE UNIVERSITIES TO DO YES THAT THE OKAY SO THAT'S WHAT YOUR INFORMATION -- A SPECIFIC INFORMATION TO UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS AT THIS ALSO APPLIES TO THEM AND THAT THEY'LL BE FREE OF RETALIATION RESTATING THE LAW AS WE'RE DOING HERE RIGHT SO THAT WE CAN INFORM ALL STUDENTS INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE AND DOCUMENT THAT THEY'RE WELCOME ON CAMPUS IN THE WELCOME. TO EXPRESS THEIR FREEDOM WELL I'LL TALK TO MY JOIN AUTHOR ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS. GAVE UP -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I I HAVE TO SAY I WAS INCLINED TO SUPPORT THIS -- SORT OF AS A NO BRAINER BECAUSE I'M A BIG FIRST MMA GUY BUT NOW I'M I'M START TO QUESTION THAT. AND SO I'M JUST CURIOUS MISTER KELLY WHAT'S YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE APPLICATION OF THE IRST AMENDMENT. TO NON CITIZENS INCLUDING THE UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS THAT -- MRS GONZALEZ FLETCHER MENTIONED. THIS BILL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT THIS IS ABOUT -- MODELING UNIVERSITIES TO ADOPT FREE SPEECH STATEMENTS AFTER THE UNIVERSITY CHICAGO UC IRVINE -- AND EXPRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF FREE SPEECH ON CAMPUS. I AGAIN I'LL JUST ASK MY QUESTION AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S DIRECTLY SQUARELY ON POINT WHICH IS WHAT YOUR INTERESTS UNDERSTAND OF THE APPLICATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT. TO UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS ON CAMPUS I HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT. AND MR GABRIEL I'M GOING TO INTERJECT HERE JUST TO GIVE SOME BACKGROUND AND HISTORY OF HOW WE WE GOT HERE. AND WHY MR KYLIE'S BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD -- AS GENTLEMEN STATED. YOU KNOW I I I WAS A COLLEGE STUDENT -- REMIND PEOPLE IN THE SEVENTIES WHERE WE VERY MUCH VALUE OUR FREEDOM OF SPEECH. AND IT WAS IN THE LATE SIXTIES RIGHT IN THE LATE SIXTIES AT AT BERKELEY WHERE MY AUDIO SAVI ON THE FREE SPEECH MOVEMENT BEGAN. AND AND I AM. PROUD TO SAY THAT MY YOU SAW THE CAME TO MY CAMPUS UC RIVERSIDE SOMETIME BEFORE I GOT THERE BUT HE WAS THERE. AND THEN I GO BACK TO BERKELEY AND I STAND IN THE PLACE WHERE MY IDEAS OBVIO BEGAN THE FREE SPEECH MOVEMENT AND THAT'S THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA. WE ALL BELIEVE IN FREE SPEECH -- ESPECIALLY IN HIGHER EDUCATION HOWEVER -- AND WHY WE ARE HERE IS BECAUSE IT HAS. AS I THINK THE AUTHOR. INDICATED YOU KNOW COME UP AGAIN BY STUDENTS AND INVITING THIS INVITING SECURITY AND SO IT IT I THINK WE HAD TWO BILLS LAST YEAR. ON FREE SPEECH AND AND I VERY MUCH PREFERRED THIS WENT TO THE ALTERNATIVE. A BILL THAT WAS OFFERED AND SO WE SUPPOTED THIS BILL -- I I THINK IT IS. PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD BILL -- IT ENJOYS A SUPPORT POSITION OF A PASS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR. I I I I AS THE CHAIR THINK IT SHOULD A PASS OUT OF COMMITTEE THIS YEAR AND I JUST HEARD -- OUR COLLEAGUE MR QUIRK OFFERED TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION AND I AM. MIGHT HOPE THAT THAT HAPPENS. I I APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I THINK MY CONCERN HERE IS THAT -- THE PURPOSE IS THE FIRST MAN OR PROTECT PROTECT ALL SPEECH AND IT'S ESPECIALLY SPEECH THAT'S ON POPULAR OR FROM PEOPLE THAT THE MAJORITY MAY NOT WANT TO HEAR FROM IT SO. I I THINK THE INTENTION -- I'M GONNA SURMISE HEAR FROM OUR COLLEAGUE IS THAT SOMETIMES CONSERVATIVE STUDENTS ONLINE LIBERAL CAMPUSES MIGHT NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE EXPRESSING THEIR OPINION. AND I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT THEY SHOULD BE COMFORTABLE BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK THAT UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS ALSO HAVE TO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE EXPRESSING THEIR OPINIONS IT WITHOUT FEAR OF REPRISAL AND IT CAN'T JUST BE. FREE SPEECH FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WE AGREE WITH THAT HAS TO BE FREE SPEECH FOR ALL AND SO I'M VERY SURPRISED ESPECIALLY GIVEN. MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS THAT IT SQUARELY APPLIES TO NON CITIZENS THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE MUCH DISPUTE ABOUT THAT. IN IN THE CASE LAW AS I UNDERSTAND IT SO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE THAT THERE SOME HESITANCY HERE ABOUT -- YOU KNOW UP SAYING THAT WE'RE GONNA SUPPORT THE FIRST AMENDMENT WHEN IT APPLIES TO UNDOCUMENTED FOLKS. THAT GIVES ME PAUSE BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE WHAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS MEANT TO PROTECT AGAINST WHICH IS THE GOVERNMENT. PICKING SPEECH THAT IT AGREES WITH AND NOT BEING WILLING TO SUPPORT SPEECH THAT HE DISAGREES WITH SO -- I I UNDERSTAND THAT IT IT HAS A SUPPORT RECOMMENDATION THAT THAT WEIGHS VERY HEAVILY FOR ME AND THINKING ABOUT THIS BILL BUT WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR WHEN WE'RE DOING THIS. THAT FREE SPEECH MEANS FREE SPEECH FOR EVERYBODY INCLUDING ARE UNDOCUMENTED I I I KNOW WHERE DISAGREE WITH EITHER SIDE. WITH EITHER THE AUTHOR OR ANYTHING THAT'S BEEN SAID HERE AS A MATTER OF FACT. AND I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY AND I'M SITTING HERE WITH. A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT ATTORNEYS. JUST A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER I DON'T THINK WE CAN. WE I DON'T THINK WE CAN ADD OR TAKE AWAY TO THE FIRST AMENDMENT. I I I THINK FREE SPEECH AS AN AMENDMENT AT AS GUARANTEED IN THE CONSTITUTION IS JUST THAT AND IT IS [inaudible] CONSTITUTIONALLY GUARANTEED AND AS I DO REMEMBER AS A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER THAT -- FREEDOM OF SPEECH DOESN'T STOP AT THE CLASSROOM DOOR. EVEN AS IT APPLIES. TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. AND I AGREE ON ALL THE NEWS ON ALL THE NEWS BUT I I'M JUST SAYING THAT SOME OF THE DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE HAVING I THINK. IS A LITTLE BIT OUTSIDE THE PURVIEW OF THIS BILL THAT'S BEING PRESENTED HERE I DON'T I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DISAGREEMENT. BY MR QUIRK OR MR KYLIE THAT FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS THAT FREEDOM OF SPEECH -- IS FOR ALL. AND WE WE'VE GONE THROUGH THIS QUITE A BIT IN THIS COMMITTEE YOU KNOW -- YOUR REGARDLESS OF POINT OF VIEW YOUR REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS I I I DON'T DISAGREE -- I'M JUST SAYING THAT SOME OF THIS DISCUSSION MIGHT BE BETTER HAD. OUTSIDE THIS COMMITTEE AFTER -- WE WE DEAL WITH THIS BILL AS IT IS NOW IN THIS COMMITTEE. SO WHAT DID WE HAVE A MOTION. I THINK THERE'S A MOTION AND A SECOND YES WELL OKAY SO WE DID HAVE A MOTION. MOTION WAS MOVED WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE. IF WE HAD TO MOVE A MOTION BY DOCTOR CHOI. SECOND BY [inaudible] MISTER KYLIE. OF MADAM CHAIR IF YOU'D CALL THE ROLL.

COMMITTEE MEMBERS TODAY I RESENT. AV. EIGHT THIRTEEN FORTY SIX ABC THIRTEEN FORTY SIX WILL ALLOW THE TERMS OF FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS CLOSURES AND MISS REPRESENTATION TO RECOVER FUNDS. SPAT WHILE ATTENDING SCHOOL. WITH ME TODAY. IS NO ZIMMER A LAWYER FROM HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RIGHTS ADVOCATE. AND JENNY MORRIS A FORMER STUDENT. IMPACTED BY FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS MISS REPRESENTATION. AT A MEETING OF OUR YEAH GO AHEAD. I JUST LANDED IN IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I REMIND MY PRESENTERS THAT EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES YOUR QUICK -- JUST. A QUICK COMMENT AND I MAY HAVE TO THE GENIE STATEMENT FOR HER BECAUSE SHE SEEMS TO HAVE LOST HER VOICE WHICH IS GOING TO GET -- SO MY NAME IS NO WASN'T AROUND THE MANAGING ATTORNEY FOR HAS. A GREAT ADVOCATE THERE IS A NON PROFIT LEGAL SERVICES ORGANIZATION THAT FOCUSES ON ECONOMIC JUSTICE ISSUES. AFTER FIVE YEARS IN PARTICULAR IS THAT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME HELPING FORMER STUDENTS OF FAILED. PREDATORY FOR PROFIT COLLEGES TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES WERE ADVOCATING FOR A. B.. THIRTEEN FORTY SIX BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS RECOGNITION OF THE FAR REACHING FINANCIAL IMPACT. THAT FAILED FOR PROFITS HAVE ON THEIR STUDENTS. WE'VE SPOKEN WITH HUNDREDS OF CALIFORNIA TO OUR FORMER STUDENTS OF FAILED AND FAILING FOR PROFIT COLLEGES LIKE HEALD. EVEREST AND WHY ATTACK THESE ARE THE CORINTHIAN COLLEGES I. T. T. BROOKS THE ART INSTITUTE AND MARINELLA. DID YOUR ROLE DURING THE SCHOOL'S COLLAPSE OR AT A TIME WHEN THE SCHOOLS PROGRAMS WERE SO DEGRADED THAT THEY WERE DEVOID OF EDUCATIONAL VALUE. THE WAY THE COST OF THE MISSION AND THE RESULTING DATA IS ONE FINANCIAL HARM. THAT THE STUDENTS THERE BUT IT'S DEFINITELY NOT THE ONLY CAR FORMER STUDENTS TELL US THEY WERE PRESSURED TO SIGN UP FOR CLASSES IMMEDIATELY. AND ALSO THE TRAVELER MOVED HIGHER PRICE COMMUNITIES TO ATTEND CLASSES AND INEFFECTIVE INTERNSHIPS. THE STUDENTS HAD TO CUT DOWN HOURS ON WORK OR SOMETIMES STOP ENTIRELY LOSING INCOME IN ACCESS TO BENEFITS SUCH AS HEALTH CARE. THEY SPEND DOWN FAMILY SAVINGS ON CHILD CARE FOR CLASS TIME. SUGGESTED SCHOOL SUPPLIES THAT WERE EFFECTIVELY REQUIRED AND STUDY. THEY DID THIS BECAUSE THEIR SCHOOLS LED THEM TO BELIEVE THAT THE SACRIFICES WERE NECESSARY FOR THIS SUCCESSFUL FUTURE AND THAT OF THEIR FAMILIES. THE FORMER FOR PROFIT STUDENTS WERE TARGETED BY PREDATORY SCHOOLS IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF THEIR FINANCIAL VULNERABILITY. MOST ARE LOWER INCOME AND MANY WERE THE FIRST IN THEIR FAMILIES TO ATTEND COLLEGE. MANY HAVE WORKED HARD FOR LOW WAGES FOR YEARS AND WERE SOLD A FOR PROFIT EDUCATION AS A WAY TO GET AHEAD. OFTEN THESE ARE NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS SUPPORTING THEMSELVES AS WELL AS CHILDREN PARENTS ARE EXTENDED FAMILIES. WE'RE ADVOCATING FOR A. B. THIRTEEN FORTY SIX OF THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT TUITION RECOVERY FUNDER STRESSED. CAN BETTER NOT COMPLETELY BUT BETTER REPAIR THE HARM DONE TO THE STUDENTS AND GIVE THEM A REALISTIC CHANCE OF RECOVERY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES. I HAVE NO VOICE [inaudible] OKAY. WHAT TODAY IF I MAKE IT STOP? YOU CAN READ IT. MY NAME ACTUALLY NOT MY NAME IS JEANNIE MORRIS I WENT TO THE NOW DEFUNCT MARINELLA SCHOOLS A BEAUTY HERE IN SACRAMENTO IN. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE PROGRAM WAS TEN SHORT MONTHS NOTHING TOO GLAMOROUS THE SCHOOL WAS A SMALL HOLE IN THE WALL PLACE. I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALL UNDERSTAND THAT EVERYONE ENROLLED AT LEAST WHILE I ATTENDED WAS EITHER ON SOME SORT OF GOVERNMENTAL ASSISTANCE OR HAD TO HAVE THEIR PARENTS COSIGN FOR THEIR LOANS. AT MARANELLO EVERYONE WITH THE SCHOOL WAS NOT BEING TRUTHFUL ABOUT THE FUN THEY RECEIVED ON THEIR LOANS BUT WE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT THAT SCHOOL PREYED UPON PEOPLE OF COLOR PEOPLE WITH LIMITED INCOME. BECAUSE WHEN THOSE PEOPLE WRITTEN ROLLED IN THE PROGRAM BUT IT SURE THAT THE SCHOOL WOULD CONTINUE TO RECEIVE. TITLE FOR LOAN PAYOFFS THE SCHOOL ONE AS FAR AS GENERAL STUDENTS KNOWING THEY HAD NO HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR GED AND HAD FRAUDULENT PASSING. TEST SCORES PUT ON THE APPLICATIONS FOR FEDERAL LOANS JUST TO SECURE THAT LOAN A FEDERAL LOAN. I WAS ONE OF THE STUDENTS I ROLLED INFORM THE WRECK STARTED I HAD NO HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR GED THEY ASSURED ME IT WAS OKAY JUST TAKE THIS TASK YOU'LL GET IN. SO DOES THE TESTING RIGHT OFF THE BAT SOMETHING WAS OFF AS SOON AS I'M DONE I GIVE MY TASK IN THE PROCTOR PULLS OUT ANOTHER TEST ALREADY GRADED AND SAYS THAT I PASSED. SO I STARTED BY TAKE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS WHICH WAS FROM ROLE MEANT THAT I HAD TO GET A PERSONAL LOAN FOR THE SCHOOL CALLED THE MARINELLA ALONE WHICH IS TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. A COVERAGE SUPPLIES AND BOOKS. THROUGHOUT THE TWO TEN MONTHS YOU MAKE MONTHLY PAYMENTS BACK TO THE SCHOOL TO PAY OFF THE LOAN EVERY STUDENT HAD TO GET A MARYLAND MERIT ALONE. I DEBATED BORROW FOR MY MOM FOR RENT BECAUSE I WAS MAKING MY MONTHLY PAYMENTS TO THE SCHOOL MY HUSBAND COULD NOT WORK BECAUSE HE WAS PROVIDING CHILDCARE -- IF YOU DIDN'T MAKE THE PAYMENTS TO THE SCHOOL YOU WERE KICKED OUT. THE SCHOOLS DOCUMENTS SHOW THAT THE GRANT MONEY I RECEIVED WENT TO ROOM AND BOARD EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T RECEIVE ROOM AND BOARD. TRANSPORTATION WHICH I NEVER RECEIVED ANY MONEY FOR AND MISCELLANEOUS. I DON'T LIVE ON CAMPUS THIS WILL NEVER PAID FOR ANY GAS WHERE WAS THE REST THAT WHAT THE MISCELLANEOUS. THE SCHOOL ALSO FORCED ME TO INCREASE ONE OF MY LOANS TO MAKE SURE I GOT MY MARINELLA LOAN PAID OFF BEFORE I WENT TO STATE BOARDS. WHEN THE SCHOOL RECEIVED A CHECK IN MY NAME THEY TRY TO MAKE ME SIGN THE CHECK OVER TO THEM? I'M UNSURE OF HOW MANY. IT IS ACTUALLY DID BUT I DID NOT I HAVE TO CASH THE CHECK WHEN THE SCHOOL FOUND OUT THAT I CAST IT WAS THREATENED WITH EXPULSION OF MY LOAN WAS NOT PAID BACK IN FULL. THE PROGRAM'S TOTAL COST ROUGHLY TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT MINE WERE. TWENTY TWO I WAS PROMISED A LIFETIME JOB PLACEMENT ASSISTANCE AND THAT WOULD MAKE I WOULD MAKE TEN TIMES MORE MONEY WITH MY COSMETOLOGY LICENSE. I'M REALISTIC I KNEW I WOULDN'T BE SOME SUMER SUPER GLARING GLAMOROUS HAIR STYLIST LIKE TAB WITH THE COFFEE. BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE I'VE YET TO FIND AN HOURLY JOB THAT PAYS MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE. MY EXPERIENCE IS NOTHING UNUSUAL TO ANYONE IS ATTENDED A FOR PROFIT POST SECONDARY COLLEGE MY TIME IN MARANELLO IS UNNECESSARY DATA THAT I'VE HAD TO CARRY WITH ME FOR YEARS. THEY DID CHECK TREMENDOUS DAMAGE TO ME AND MY CREDIT. AND THE PROCESS TO GET THAT DEBT FORGIVEN WAS JUST AS BAD.
