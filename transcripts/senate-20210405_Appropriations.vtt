THEMSELVES THE ESTABLISHED THAT

00:39:23.394 --> 00:39:24.628
SO THIS WILL AND CAUSE AN

00:39:24.695 --> 00:39:25.896
INCREASE IN ROBBERIES BECAUSE

00:39:25.963 --> 00:39:27.364
ROBBERIES ARE MORE LUCRATIVE.

00:39:27.431 --> 00:39:28.766

STRONG ARM ROBBERIES WHICH IS

00:39:35.806 --> 00:39:38.943
WHAT THESE WOULD BE- IN TWO

00:39:39.009 --> 00:39:39.477
THOUSAND NINETEEN IF THIS

00:39:39.543 --> 00:39:41.345

ROBBERIES. THE MARGINAL COST

00:39:44.215 --> 00:39:45.750
FOR POLICE RESPONSE WOULD BE AN

00:39:45.816 --> 00:39:47.651
ADDITIONAL ANNUAL COST OF SEVEN

00:39:47.718 --> 00:39:48.819
POINT NINE EIGHT MILLION THAT

00:39:48.886 --> 00:39:49.820

THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.

00:39:52.123 --> 00:39:52.623
CALIFORNIA IS OBVIOUSLY MORE

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:55.159

OF THESE ADDITIONAL ROBBERIES

00:39:59.396 --> 00:40:00.631
WOULD BE FOUR POINT ONE NINE

00:40:00.698 --> 00:40:02.967
SEVEN. IT'S LIKELY THE INCREASE

00:40:03.033 --> 00:40:04.301
WILL BE MORE COMMENSURATE WITH

00:40:04.368 --> 00:40:05.803
THE INCREASE OF LARCENY THEFT

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:07.037
THAT HAPPENED WITH PROP FORTY

00:40:07.104 --> 00:40:08.839
SEVEN. THAT THAT'S THE CASE

00:40:08.906 --> 00:40:10.708
THAT WOULD BE A 27% INCREASE

00:40:10.775 --> 00:40:13.010
WHICH WOULD BE. A PLUS TWENTY

00:40:13.077 --> 00:40:14.912
ONE POINT FIVE SIX MILLION A

00:40:14.979 --> 00:40:15.646

EVERYONE APPLIED. THE AUTHOR

00:40:22.153 --> 00:40:24.021
HAS SAID THAT. IF THESE

00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:25.389
ADDITIONAL ROBBERIES OCCUR AND

00:40:25.456 --> 00:40:27.091

00:40:30.394 --> 00:40:32.463
MORE OF AN EXPENSE WITH AGAIN

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:34.732
WITH THAT 10% INCREASE. IT

00:40:34.799 --> 00:40:36.901

DISTINGUISHED PANEL. THE FISCAL

01:13:49.691 --> 01:13:51.760
IMPACT OF S. B. TWO SIXTY TWO

01:13:51.827 --> 01:13:54.329
COMES FROM THE FACT. BUT IT

01:13:54.396 --> 01:13:55.164
TAKES DISCRETION AWAY FROM

01:13:55.230 --> 01:13:57.132
JUDGES TO POTENTIALLY SET A

01:13:57.199 --> 01:13:58.433
DIFFERENT BILL IF THERE'S A

01:13:58.500 --> 01:13:59.835
SAFETY RISK OR A FLIGHT RISK

01:13:59.902 --> 01:14:01.436

CODE SECTION TWELVE SIXTY NINE

01:14:03.038 --> 01:14:05.574
BE. SAY IF A CRIME IS NOT ON

01:14:05.641 --> 01:14:07.776
THE LIST IT'S ZERO BAIL THIS

01:14:07.843 --> 01:14:09.945
ACTUALLY CREATES A ZERO BAIL

01:14:10.012 --> 01:14:12.047
LOOPHOLE BECAUSE IF YOUR CRIME

01:14:12.114 --> 01:14:14.149
IS NOT ON THE LIST. WHICH IS

01:14:14.216 --> 01:14:15.350
FINE IF YOU YOU'RE GIVEN THAT

01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:17.486
CHANCE TO SHOW UP IF YOU DON'T

01:14:17.553 --> 01:14:19.655
SHOW UP A WARRANT IS ISSUED. IN

01:14:19.721 --> 01:14:21.657
THE AMOUNT OF ZERO BAIL AGAIN

01:14:21.723 --> 01:14:23.625
EVEN A FAILURE TO APPEAR IS

01:14:23.692 --> 01:14:25.093
ZERO BAIL. SO THEORETICALLY

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.695
PEOPLE WOULD BE STUCK IN A

01:14:26.762 --> 01:14:27.429
LOOPHOLE WHERE IF THEIR CRIME

01:14:27.496 --> 01:14:29.198
IS ON THE LIST. THEY COULD

01:14:29.264 --> 01:14:32.367
NEVER SHOW UP FOR COURT. THE IF

01:14:32.434 --> 01:14:35.270
THIS CAUSES EVEN A 10% INCREASE

01:14:35.337 --> 01:14:37.573
IN FAILURES TO APPEAR. THIS

01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:39.741
WOULD COST AT A MARGINAL áP

01:14:39.808 --> 01:14:42.511
MARGINAL COST FOR THE POLICE

01:14:42.578 --> 01:14:44.246
RESPONSE TO ADDRESSING FTAS

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:46.949
WOULD BE. IN MY OPINION A

01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:49.151
MINIMUM ONE POINT THREE TWO TWO

01:14:49.218 --> 01:14:51.653
TOTAL ANNUALLY- BUT THE GREATER

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.121
RISK COMES FROM THE CRIMES THAT

01:14:53.188 --> 01:14:54.223
WOULD BE COMMITTED WHILE PEOPLE

01:14:54.289 --> 01:14:56.024
ARE OUT ON ZERO BAIL WE HAD A

01:14:56.091 --> 01:14:57.926
CHANCE TO SEE THIS DURING KOBE-

01:14:57.993 --> 01:14:59.561
IN YOLO COUNTY WHERE PRACTICE

01:14:59.628 --> 01:15:01.763
WE HAD OVER EIGHT HUNDRED.

01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:02.865
CRIMES COMMITTED BY PEOPLE

01:15:02.931 --> 01:15:04.466
RELEASED ON ZERO BAIL IF YOU

01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:05.634
LOOK AT THE ZERO BILL EMERGENCY

01:15:05.701 --> 01:15:07.369
SCHEDULES COUNTY TO COUNTY I

01:15:07.436 --> 01:15:09.004
DID NOT LOOK AT ALL OF THEM BUT

01:15:09.071 --> 01:15:10.839
I TOOK A CROSS SECTION. THEY

01:15:10.906 --> 01:15:13.141
MORE OR LESS MIRROR THE CRIME
