BEING SUPPOSED TO CHEMICALS BUT

00:31:03.995 --> 00:31:05.997

THE REALITY WAS IN THOSE MOMENTS

00:31:23.681 --> 00:31:24.349
WHEN I WAS SPRAYED I FELT

00:31:24.415 --> 00:31:26.918

ANOTHER BARRIER. TO REALLY

ESTABLISH THOSE RELATIONSHIPS

00:31:37.195 --> 00:31:38.596
BETWEEN YOUTH AND STAFF THAT CAN

FACILITY STOPPED.

00:33:00.111 --> 00:33:01.446
THE USE OF CHEMICAL SPRAY IN

00:33:04.115 --> 00:33:06.818
INCREASING 210023100% IN SOME

00:33:06.884 --> 00:33:10.188
FACILITIES.

00:33:10.254 --> 00:33:11.856
WE ALSO NOTE THAT.

00:33:11.923 --> 00:33:13.124
A FEW JURISDICTIONS IN

00:33:13.191 --> 00:33:14.792
CALIFORNIA DO NOT USE SPRAY AND

00:33:14.859 --> 00:33:17.528
MOST JURISDICTIONS NATIONWIDE DO

00:33:17.595 --> 00:33:19.297
NOT USE SPRAY.

00:33:19.364 --> 00:33:21.032
IN THE JUVENILE FACILITIES.

00:33:21.099 --> 00:33:23.000
AND LA COUNTY IS CURRENTLY

00:33:23.067 --> 00:33:24.569
DEVELOPING A PLAN TO STOP THE

00:33:24.635 --> 00:33:26.838
USE OF SPRAY IN THEIR FACILITIES

00:33:26.904 --> 00:33:28.506
BY THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR.

00:33:28.573 --> 00:33:30.708
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW?

00:33:30.775 --> 00:33:32.243
IS HOW OFTEN THIS HARMFUL

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:34.479
PRACTICES BEING USED ON YOUTH IN

00:33:34.545 --> 00:33:35.747

CALIFORNIA.

00:33:37.081 --> 00:33:38.383

PROBATION HAS TO COLLECT THESE

00:33:41.586 --> 00:33:42.353
DATA.

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:45.923
BUT THEY ARE NOT SHARED PUBLICLY.

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:47.625
WE ONLY KNOW ABOUT LA COUNTY'S

00:33:47.692 --> 00:33:49.227
USE OF CAM SPRAY BECAUSE THE

00:33:49.293 --> 00:33:50.728
PRESS GOT A HOLD OF SOME DATA

00:33:50.795 --> 00:33:51.562
AND BECAUSE THE BOARD OF

00:33:51.629 --> 00:33:53.464
SUPERVISORS DECIDED TO REVIEW.

00:33:53.531 --> 00:33:55.400

00:33:56.968 --> 00:33:58.236
CONTROVERSIAL.

00:33:58.302 --> 00:33:59.570
AND THAT THERE IS RESISTANCE TO

GIVING UP OLD FAMILIAR PRACTICES

00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:02.807
BUT WE WANT JUVENILE JUSTICE

WE NEED RESEARCH.

00:34:10.448 --> 00:34:12.183
IT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT WHEN

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:14.051
THE ISSUE IS SO CONTROVERSIAL.

00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:15.586
TO SHAPE GOOD POLICIES WE ALSO

00:34:15.653 --> 00:34:16.954
NEED TO KNOW WHAT IS WORKING

00:34:17.021 --> 00:34:19.056
WELL IN OTHER LOCALES LOCALES OF

IS HAPPENING STATEWIDE WITH

00:34:28.966 --> 00:34:30.501
REGARD TO USE OF CAM SPRAY AND

00:34:30.568 --> 00:34:31.903

LOCALES HAVE FIGURED OUT.

00:34:33.671 --> 00:34:35.473
THAT WORK BETTER TO SUPPORT THE

01:07:55.871 --> 01:07:56.405
ASSUMPTION WOULD BE THEY WOULD

01:07:56.472 --> 01:07:56.972
PASS IT DOWN AND THIS IS MY

01:07:57.039 --> 01:07:59.508
FINAL QUESTION -- MY CONCERN IS

01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:01.911
THAT THE RETAILERS OR ACT

01:08:01.977 --> 01:08:03.145
ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE RETAILERS

01:08:03.212 --> 01:08:04.480
OF PASSED THE TAX DOWN TO THE

01:08:04.547 --> 01:08:07.149
CONSUMER LIKE THEY ALWAYS DO.

01:08:07.216 --> 01:08:09.985
DO YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT

01:08:10.052 --> 01:08:14.223
THE PROSPECT OF THIS SORT OF

01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:15.658
DISCOURAGING FOLKS FROM

01:08:15.724 --> 01:08:17.726
PURCHASING IN THE LEGAL MARKET

01:08:17.793 --> 01:08:19.028
AND WANTING TO REVERT BACK TO

01:08:19.094 --> 01:08:20.996
PURCHASING IN THE ILLEGAL MARKET

01:08:21.063 --> 01:08:22.798
WHICH WE TEND TO KIND OF TALK

01:08:22.865 --> 01:08:24.033
ABOUT NOT WANTING TO HAVE.

01:08:24.099 --> 01:08:26.001
SORT OF TWO RESPONSES THE FIRST

01:08:26.068 --> 01:08:28.304
IS -- I ACTUALLY DO.

01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:29.839
I THINK SOME LIKELY WOULD PASSED

01:08:29.905 --> 01:08:31.740
THE THE CHARGE ON TO THEIR

01:08:31.807 --> 01:08:32.942
PURCHASERS BUT MANY WOULDN'T

01:08:33.008 --> 01:08:34.043
THIS IS A HIGHLY PROFITABLE

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:36.078
INDUSTRY FOR A GUN SALES HAVE

01:08:36.145 --> 01:08:37.313
MORE THAN DOUBLED IN CALIFORNIA

01:08:37.379 --> 01:08:39.381
IN THE LAST DECADE -- AND MANY

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:40.783
OF THESE ARE CORPORATIONS THAT

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:41.417
JUST RECEIVED A BIG FEDERAL TAX

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:45.221
CUT -- BUT SECOND I THINK THE

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:46.489
TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR.

01:08:46.555 --> 01:08:49.425
FEE OF A NEW FIRE PURCHASES AB.

01:08:49.492 --> 01:08:50.559
I THINK YOU MEANT IS NOT LARGE

01:08:50.626 --> 01:08:52.027
ENOUGH TO REALLY SHIFT BEHAVIOR

01:08:52.094 --> 01:08:53.496
WHEN THE AVERAGE FIREARM COSTS

01:08:53.562 --> 01:08:54.730
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED

01:08:54.797 --> 01:08:55.965
DOLLARS TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED

01:08:56.031 --> 01:08:57.533
DOLLARS FOR NEW FIREARMS -- THIS

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.702
ALSO WOULDN'T APPLY TO NON SEMI

01:08:59.768 --> 01:09:01.170
AUTOMATIC RIFLES AND SHOTGUNS

01:09:01.237 --> 01:09:02.204
ARE MOST COMMONLY USED FOR

01:09:02.271 --> 01:09:04.206
HUNTING SO THIS IS NOT A PLAN TO

01:09:04.273 --> 01:09:05.641
USE FIREARMS THAT YOU'RE BUYING

01:09:05.708 --> 01:09:07.643
FROM ANOTHER UNLICENSED PERSON

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:08.878
THROUGH A DEALER.

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:09.044
SO.

01:09:09.111 --> 01:09:10.513
OUR THOUGHT IS THAT WE'RE

01:09:10.579 --> 01:09:11.847
OBVIOUSLY NOT INTERESTED IN AND

01:09:11.914 --> 01:09:13.349
ENCOURAGING ANYONE TO GO TO THE

01:09:13.415 --> 01:09:15.518
LEGAL MARKET -- BUT WE THINK A

01:09:15.584 --> 01:09:16.619
TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR FEE FOR THESE

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:18.287
REASONS IS NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:19.788
REALLY SHIFT BEHAVIOR MUCH

01:09:19.855 --> 01:09:21.457
SMALLER THAN ON AVERAGE THE

01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:23.225
FEDERAL MANUFACTURERS TAX.

01:09:23.292 --> 01:09:26.695
WHICH IS A 10211% ON USUALLY

01:09:26.762 --> 01:09:27.329
FIVE HUNDRED TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED

01:09:27.396 --> 01:09:29.832
DOLLARS AND BE SIGNIFICANTLY

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:30.900
LARGER THAN THIS WOULD BE.

01:09:30.966 --> 01:09:31.800
SURE THANK YOU.

01:09:31.867 --> 01:09:32.334

01:14:12.648 --> 01:14:13.849
CONVICTED OF SOMETHING LESS

01:14:13.916 --> 01:14:15.584
THERE'S NO WAY TO GET THE YOUNG

01:14:15.651 --> 01:14:16.418
PERSON.

01:14:16.485 --> 01:14:20.689
BACK TO JUVENILE COURT AND SO AB

01:14:20.756 --> 01:14:22.191
FOURTEEN TWENTY THREE PROVIDES

01:14:22.257 --> 01:14:23.992
FOR THREE SPECIFIC SITUATIONS

01:14:24.059 --> 01:14:25.127
ONE IS WHERE.

01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:26.728
THE YOUNG PERSON GOES TO ADULT

01:14:26.795 --> 01:14:28.697
COURT AND IS CONVICTED ONLY OF

01:14:28.764 --> 01:14:30.165
MISDEMEANORS.

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:31.066
AND YOU WOULDN'T EVEN BE

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:32.701
ELIGIBLE FOR TRANSFER ON

01:14:32.768 --> 01:14:36.205
MISDEMEANORS SO THAT ONE IS EASY.

01:14:36.271 --> 01:14:37.539
THE SECOND ONE IS WHERE THE

01:14:37.606 --> 01:14:39.208
YOUNG PERSON GOES TO ADULT COURT

01:14:39.274 --> 01:14:41.143
AND IS CONVICTED STILL OF A

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:43.545
FELONY BUT A MUCH LESS SERIOUS

01:14:43.612 --> 01:14:44.146
FELONY.

01:14:44.213 --> 01:14:45.480
THAN THAN THE FRANCE FOR

01:14:45.547 --> 01:14:47.316
DECISION WAS PREMISED ON AND IN

01:14:47.382 --> 01:14:48.851
THAT CASE THIS BILL WILL ALLOW

01:14:48.917 --> 01:14:51.153
THE COURT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:52.855
RECORD OF THE TRANSFER HEARING.

01:14:52.921 --> 01:14:55.424
AND IF IT LOOKS LIKE THE OFFENSE

01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:57.192
WAS SERIOUSLY A FACTOR IN THE

01:14:57.259 --> 01:14:58.694
DECISION TO TRANSFER THE YOUNG

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:01.396
PERSON THE COURT HAS THE ABILITY

01:15:01.463 --> 01:15:02.965
IN THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE TO

01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:05.033
TRANSFER THE CASE BACK. TO

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:06.535
JUVENILE COURT FOR DISPOSITION.

01:15:06.602 --> 01:15:09.071
THE THIRTY SITUATION IS THE ONE

01:15:09.137 --> 01:15:11.073
THAT I THINK IS WHAT --

01:15:11.139 --> 01:15:12.474
PERCOLATED THE INTEREST OF THE

01:15:12.541 --> 01:15:14.376
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S ANDTHAT'S

01:15:14.443 --> 01:15:15.944
IN THE CASE OF PLEA BARGAINS.

01:15:16.011 --> 01:15:17.880
AND WE THINK THAT THEY HAVE A

01:15:17.946 --> 01:15:19.248
LEGITIMATE POINT THAT A PLEA

01:15:19.314 --> 01:15:20.916
BARGAIN TO A LESSER OFFENSE

01:15:20.983 --> 01:15:22.484
COULD BE FOR A VARIETY OF

01:15:22.551 --> 01:15:24.186
REASONS OTHER THAN JUST THE

01:15:24.253 --> 01:15:25.687
SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENSE.

01:15:25.754 --> 01:15:27.389
AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE

01:15:27.456 --> 01:15:30.659
AMENDMENTS IS TO REQUIRE THAT

01:15:30.726 --> 01:15:32.527
THE COURT MAKE THE DETERMINATION

01:15:32.594 --> 01:15:34.229
THAT THE CASE IN THE INTERESTS

01:15:34.296 --> 01:15:35.497
OF JUSTICE SHOULD GO BACK.

01:15:35.564 --> 01:15:37.466
BUT ALSO REQUIRE THE CONSENT OF

01:15:37.532 --> 01:15:39.401
THE PROSECUTOR AND WHEN YOU

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:40.836
REALIZE THAT.

01:15:40.903 --> 01:15:42.971
OVER 90% OF CASES ARE RESOLVED

01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:44.806
BY PLEA BARGAINS THIS GIVES THE

01:15:44.873 --> 01:15:47.542
PROSECUTOR AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF

01:15:47.609 --> 01:15:48.176
POWER.

01:15:48.243 --> 01:15:50.312
THIS BILL CAME -- TO BECAME TO

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:52.681
YOU BECAUSE OF THE EXPERIENCE OF

01:15:58.520 --> 01:15:59.688
AND WIND UP.

01:16:01.623 --> 01:16:03.325

01:16:11.566 --> 01:16:13.635

01:16:13.702 --> 01:16:15.737

01:53:48.988 --> 01:53:49.989
I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND WHERE

POSSIBLY KNOW THAT.

01:53:54.894 --> 01:53:56.162
WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT

01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:58.998
CHILDREN'S LIVES ARE RUINED WHEN

01:53:59.065 --> 01:54:01.234
THIS HAPPENS?

01:54:01.301 --> 01:54:02.835
WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE TALK

01:54:02.902 --> 01:54:04.871
ABOUT THE EFFECT THAT HAS ON THE

01:54:04.938 --> 01:54:06.706
OFFENDER AND THE OFFENDER'S

01:54:06.773 --> 01:54:08.241
FAMILY AND I CERTAINLY

01:54:08.308 --> 01:54:09.776
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THAT MUST

01:54:09.842 --> 01:54:10.510
BE.

01:54:10.577 --> 01:54:12.478
SOMETHING DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH

01:54:12.545 --> 01:54:14.013
AS YOU TRY TO MOVE THROUGH YOUR

01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:16.416

01:54:16.482 --> 01:54:18.451

SOCIETY AND HOW WE EXPECT PEOPLE

01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:21.921

PORTION OF IT JUST ONE PORTION.

01:54:33.866 --> 01:54:36.202
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE BUT IF

01:54:36.269 --> 01:54:39.339
YOU MOLEST A CHILD. FOURTEEN OR

01:54:39.405 --> 01:54:40.240
FIFTEEN THAT YOUR PUNISHMENT IS

01:54:40.306 --> 01:54:41.741
DIFFERENT THAN IF THE CHILD IS

01:54:41.808 --> 01:54:43.343
UNDER FOURTEEN IT JUST DOESN'T

01:54:43.409 --> 01:54:45.645
MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME

THE WAY I'M LOOKING AT THIS IN

01:54:49.148 --> 01:54:50.350

WHO HAS SOMETHING IN THEIR PAST?

01:55:04.397 --> 01:55:06.065
THAT WOULD WARRANTED THEM TO BE

01:55:06.132 --> 01:55:07.767
A LITTLE MORE CAUTIOUS AROUND

01:55:07.834 --> 01:55:10.370
THAT PERSON.

01:55:10.436 --> 01:55:12.872
THAT MEANS THAT.

01:55:12.939 --> 01:55:15.308
IF YOU KNOW THAT THE NICE MAN

01:55:15.375 --> 01:55:16.242
THAT LIVES DOWN THE STREET FROM

01:55:16.309 --> 01:55:18.678
YOU WHO'S A SENIOR CITIZEN WHO'S

01:55:18.745 --> 01:55:20.546

YOU SHOULD PROBABLY KNOW.

01:55:25.785 --> 01:55:27.020
IF HE HAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN

01:55:27.086 --> 01:55:29.289
HIS PAST BEFORE YOU ASK HIM TO

01:55:29.355 --> 01:55:30.657
BABY SIT.

01:55:30.723 --> 01:55:32.258
YOUR TWO YEAR OLD TODDLER WHO

01:55:32.325 --> 01:55:34.927
CAN'T TALK AND CAN'T COMMUNICATE

01:55:34.994 --> 01:55:36.663
TO YOU WHAT HE MAY.

01:55:36.729 --> 01:55:38.431
BE DOING TO HER WHEN YOU'RE NOT

01:55:38.498 --> 01:55:39.866
AROUND.

01:55:39.932 --> 01:55:42.502
WE ALL KNOW CHILD MOLESTERS ARE

01:55:42.568 --> 01:55:45.204
NOT LIKE SOMEBODY IN A DARK

01:55:45.271 --> 01:55:47.006
TRENCH COAT WITH GLASSES AND A

01:55:47.073 --> 01:55:48.541

01:55:48.608 --> 01:55:50.610
MOST OF THE TIMES IT'S SOMEONE

01:55:50.677 --> 01:55:51.911
ALMOST ALL OF THE TIME IT'S

01:55:51.978 --> 01:55:54.380
SOMEONE THAT THEY NOW IT IS NOT

01:55:54.447 --> 01:55:55.682
A STRANGER IT'S SOMEONE WHO

01:55:55.748 --> 01:55:57.950
DEVELOPS A REPORT A RELATIONSHIP

01:55:58.017 --> 01:55:59.619
WITH THAT CHILD.

01:55:59.686 --> 01:56:01.087
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE SO VULNERABLE

01:56:01.154 --> 01:56:02.855
BECAUSE THEY'RE SO GOOD AT IT

01:56:02.922 --> 01:56:04.557
AND THEY'RE SO MANIPULATIVE INTO

01:56:04.624 --> 01:56:05.958
GETTING PEOPLE TO THINK THAT

01:56:06.025 --> 01:56:08.127
THEY ARE PERFECTLY SAFE AND WHAT

01:56:08.194 --> 01:56:10.096
I AM SAYING IS I'M NOT ASKING.

01:56:10.163 --> 01:56:12.231
THAT THEY ARE THROWN BEHIND BARS

01:56:12.298 --> 01:56:13.466
FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES THEY

01:56:13.533 --> 01:56:14.967

STOP THEM FROM DOING THAT.

01:56:19.038 --> 01:56:20.273
BUT I DO THINK WE HAVE A

01:56:20.340 --> 01:56:24.444
RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE WE

01:56:24.510 --> 01:56:26.012

PEOPLE THAT ARE AGAINST THE LAW

02:27:28.739 --> 02:27:30.141
I MEAN I WOULD BE VERY CURIOUS

02:27:30.208 --> 02:27:31.709
TO SEE IF THAT'S AVAILABLE TODAY

02:27:31.776 --> 02:27:33.444

SEVERAL UNREALISTIC MANDATES AND

02:28:31.535 --> 02:28:33.371
I THINK THAT PUTTING GUN DEALERS

02:28:33.437 --> 02:28:34.639
OUT OF BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF

02:28:34.705 --> 02:28:36.540

IN YOUR CLOTHES ABOUT THE

02:28:58.729 --> 02:29:00.197
MILLION DOLLAR BECAUSE THAT THAT

02:29:00.264 --> 02:29:01.799
WAS ONE OF MY CONCERNS ABOUT

02:29:01.866 --> 02:29:04.101
WHETHER OR NOT -- ANYONE WAS

02:29:04.168 --> 02:29:08.039
CAPABLE OF BEING ABLE -- TO GET

02:29:08.105 --> 02:29:09.340
THAT INSURANCE WAS ONE BUT TO

02:29:09.407 --> 02:29:11.042
WHETHER IT BE THE TYPE OF

02:29:11.108 --> 02:29:11.776
INSURANCE.

02:29:11.842 --> 02:29:13.411
THAT WOULD.

02:29:13.477 --> 02:29:15.212
THAT ANY PERSON COULD GET WITH

02:29:15.279 --> 02:29:16.614
THEIR HOUSE OR WITH ANYTHING

02:29:16.681 --> 02:29:18.649
ELSE ON THAT THIS WOULD NOT

02:29:18.716 --> 02:29:19.984
PRECLUDE ANYBODY.

02:29:20.051 --> 02:29:21.285
FROM GETTING IT BUT MORE

02:29:21.352 --> 02:29:23.554
IMPORTANT THAT IT WAS NOT -- I

02:29:23.621 --> 02:29:25.323
THINK YOU STATED TO ME THAT IT

02:29:25.389 --> 02:29:26.424
WAS NOT SOMETHING.

02:29:26.490 --> 02:29:28.526
THAT YOU LOOKED AT IS PUTTING

02:29:28.592 --> 02:29:29.794
PEOPLE OUT OF BUSINESS THE THE

02:29:29.860 --> 02:29:31.295
MILLION DOLLARS OF WHICH IS

02:29:31.362 --> 02:29:32.730
LIABILITY TO HANDLE.

02:29:32.797 --> 02:29:33.898
IF SOMETHING WERE TO

02:29:33.964 --> 02:29:35.866
UNFORTUNATELY HAPPEN TO WOULD BE

02:29:35.933 --> 02:29:39.170

POLICE REPORTS CAN BE COMPILED.

02:55:42.765 --> 02:55:44.634

02:55:58.047 --> 02:55:59.015
RISK.

02:55:59.081 --> 02:56:00.750
OFTENTIMES ARRESTS ARE MADE BUT

EXISTING MISDEMEANOR COURT VIA

02:56:38.688 --> 02:56:40.790
PENAL CODE SECTION.

02:56:40.856 --> 02:56:41.791
NINE NINE ONE IT IS FRANKLY

02:56:41.857 --> 02:56:43.726
ALMOST NEVER USED.

02:56:43.793 --> 02:56:44.360
AND THERE ARE PIVOTAL

02:56:44.427 --> 02:56:46.228
DISTINCTIONS FIRST MISDEMEANOR

02:56:46.295 --> 02:56:48.030
CASES DO NOT HAVE THE PROTECTION

02:56:48.097 --> 02:56:49.565
OF A PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION

02:56:49.632 --> 02:56:52.068
WITHIN TEN COURT DAYS OF RAIN.

02:56:52.134 --> 02:56:52.902
SECOND.

02:56:52.969 --> 02:56:55.037
PC NINE NINE ONE ONLY APPLIES TO

02:56:55.104 --> 02:56:57.039
MISDEMEANORS WHO ARE IN CUSTODY

02:56:57.106 --> 02:56:58.874
THIS BILL WOULD APPLY TO ALL

02:56:58.941 --> 02:57:01.444
FELONIES REGARDLESS OF CUSTODIAL

02:57:01.510 --> 02:57:02.611
STATUS.

02:57:02.678 --> 02:57:03.813
ESPECIALLY ALARMING IS THE

02:57:03.879 --> 02:57:05.181
RECENT AMENDMENT TO THIS BILL

02:57:05.247 --> 02:57:06.482
WHICH WOULD CREATE A DISMISSAL

02:57:06.549 --> 02:57:07.850
WITH PREJUDICE.

02:57:07.917 --> 02:57:09.251
AGAIN THIS WILL DRAMATICALLY

02:57:09.318 --> 02:57:10.953
IMPACT HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN

02:57:11.020 --> 02:57:12.288
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES FOR

02:57:12.355 --> 02:57:14.190
EXAMPLE IN WHICH THE BIGGEST

02:57:14.256 --> 02:57:15.391
CHALLENGE TO A SUCCESSFUL

02:57:15.458 --> 02:57:17.560
PROSECUTION IS GAINING THE

02:57:17.626 --> 02:57:19.061
COOPERATION OF WITNESSES.

02:57:19.128 --> 02:57:20.563
CASES ARE OFTEN DISMISSED

02:57:20.629 --> 02:57:21.931
BECAUSE OF VICTIMS FAILED TO

02:57:21.998 --> 02:57:23.966
SHOW UP THIS BILL WOULD RESTRICT

02:57:24.033 --> 02:57:26.936
OUR ABILITY TO REFILE CASES WHEN.

02:57:27.003 --> 02:57:28.571
TO VICTIMS DECIDE TO COOPERATE.

02:57:28.637 --> 02:57:30.106
FINALLY THIS BILL REQUIRES THE

02:57:30.172 --> 02:57:32.208
MAGISTRATE TO CONSIDER ANY OF

02:57:32.274 --> 02:57:33.609
EVIDENCE PROFFERED BY THE

02:57:33.676 --> 02:57:34.910
DEFENDANT THAT SUPPORTS A

02:57:34.977 --> 02:57:37.313
FINDING OF NO PROBABLE CAUSE.

02:57:37.380 --> 02:57:38.848
BY CONFERRING A RIGHT TO PRESENT

02:57:38.914 --> 02:57:40.583
EVIDENCE.

02:57:40.649 --> 02:57:42.051
THIS PROVISION WILL ALLOW THE

02:57:42.118 --> 02:57:44.587
DEFENSE TO PRESENT UNTESTED AND

02:57:44.653 --> 02:57:46.222
UNCONTRADICTED EVIDENCE AT A

02:57:46.288 --> 02:57:47.223
HEARING.

02:57:47.289 --> 02:57:48.824
DESIGNED TO ESTABLISH PROBABLE

02:57:48.891 --> 02:57:50.059
CAUSE.

02:57:50.126 --> 02:57:52.261
IN SOME THIS BILL IS UNNECESSARY

02:57:52.328 --> 02:57:54.130
DUPLICATIVE OF OTHER LONG

02:57:54.196 --> 02:57:56.866
ESTABLISHED SAFEGUARDS AND WOULD

02:57:56.932 --> 02:57:58.200
CAUSE AN EXPENSIVE AN

02:57:58.267 --> 02:57:59.735
UNREASONABLE BURDEN ON THE

02:57:59.802 --> 02:58:01.604
JUDICIAL SYSTEM. FOR THESE

02:58:01.670 --> 02:58:04.040
REASONS CDA IS VIGOROUSLY

02:58:04.106 --> 02:58:07.109
OPPOSED TO THIS BILL THANK.

THE IN IN THE INTEREST OF TIME

02:58:15.317 --> 02:58:16.318
IN THE COMMITTEES RESOURCES I'LL

02:58:16.385 --> 02:58:17.987
SIMPLY SAY WOULD ASSOCIATE OUR

02:58:18.054 --> 02:58:20.489
MARKS WITH MISTER MORRISON --

THANK YOU I WAS WORRIED ABOUT

02:58:24.326 --> 02:58:26.095
THAT.

02:58:26.162 --> 02:58:26.762
ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN

02:58:26.829 --> 02:58:28.764
OPPOSITION.

02:58:28.831 --> 02:58:29.865
ARE YOU QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE

02:58:29.932 --> 02:58:31.100

02:58:32.234 --> 02:58:33.569
I'M.

02:58:33.636 --> 02:58:34.136
SO.

02:58:34.203 --> 02:58:35.237
THE RATE TO A PROBABLE CAUSE

02:58:35.304 --> 02:58:36.472
HEARING WE INCARCERATE SOMEONE

02:58:36.539 --> 02:58:37.540
TO TAKE THEIR FREEDOM AWAY

02:58:37.606 --> 02:58:39.608
BEFORE WE HOLD THEM IS OBVIOUSLY

02:58:39.675 --> 02:58:41.444
A RIGHT THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

02:58:41.510 --> 02:58:43.746
SHOULD NEVER TOUCH -- AND THAT

02:58:43.813 --> 02:58:45.081
RIGHT STANDS I GUESS I'M

02:58:45.147 --> 02:58:46.515
STRUGGLING WITH WHY WE NEED TO

02:58:46.582 --> 02:58:47.883
APPLY THIS TO ALL THE CHARGES

02:58:47.950 --> 02:58:49.218
WHAT IS THE BENEFIT OF THAT AND

02:58:49.285 --> 02:58:50.352
SECONDARILY.

02:58:50.419 --> 02:58:52.755
I'M CONCERNED WITH THE ABILITY

02:58:52.822 --> 02:58:54.657
TO ADD ON AND IS THERE ANYTHING

02:58:54.723 --> 02:58:55.858
THAT WOULD STOP A PROSECUTOR

02:58:55.925 --> 02:58:57.927
FROM LATER ADDING ON CHARGES.

02:58:57.993 --> 02:58:59.695
AND IF THEY WERE TO DISCOVER

02:58:59.762 --> 02:59:00.796
AGAIN IN THE PILE OF EVIDENCE

02:59:00.863 --> 02:59:02.264
THAT THERE WERE OTHER CHARGES

02:59:02.331 --> 02:59:02.865
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT

02:59:02.932 --> 02:59:03.866
THAT WERE NOT.

02:59:03.933 --> 02:59:06.202
REALIZED IN THOSE FIRST THREE

02:59:06.268 --> 02:59:06.836
DAYS.

02:59:06.902 --> 02:59:08.838
THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION.

02:59:08.904 --> 02:59:10.139
MY VIEW IS THAT IF IF YOU HAVE

02:59:10.206 --> 02:59:11.607
THIS FOR MISDEMEANORS FOR LOWER

02:59:11.674 --> 02:59:13.476
LEVELS OF CRIME.

02:59:13.542 --> 02:59:14.977
WHEN THE STAKES ARE ARGUABLY

02:59:15.044 --> 02:59:16.779
LOWER?

02:59:16.846 --> 02:59:19.782
THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE THEM FOR

02:59:19.849 --> 02:59:21.117
FELONIES WHEN THE STAKES ARE

02:59:21.183 --> 02:59:22.017
MUCH HIGHER WHERE YOU CAN BE

02:59:22.084 --> 02:59:23.519
DEPRIVED OF YOUR LIBERTY WHERE

02:59:23.586 --> 02:59:24.720
YOU COULD BE.

02:59:24.787 --> 02:59:27.490
PRESSURED TO TAKE A PLEA

02:59:27.556 --> 02:59:27.790
[inaudible]

02:59:27.857 --> 02:59:31.894
AND ALTHOUGH A A FULL

02:59:31.961 --> 02:59:33.662
EVIDENTIARY HEARING IS TEN DAYS

02:59:33.729 --> 02:59:34.330
AWAY FROM THE ARRAIGNMENT AT THE

02:59:34.396 --> 02:59:35.664
PROBABLE -- AT THE PRELIMINARY

02:59:35.731 --> 02:59:36.999
HEARING.

02:59:37.066 --> 02:59:39.235
THAT COULD BE A LIFETIME.

02:59:39.301 --> 02:59:42.138
WHEN YOU'RE IN JAIL AWAY FROM

02:59:42.204 --> 02:59:44.473
YOUR JOB AWAY FROM YOUR KIDS?

02:59:44.540 --> 02:59:45.508
THINKING ABOUT YOUR FUTURE

02:59:45.574 --> 02:59:47.343
THINKING ABOUT WHETHER YOU

02:59:47.409 --> 02:59:48.410
SHOULD TAKE A PLEA.

02:59:48.477 --> 02:59:49.745
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE

02:59:49.812 --> 02:59:51.046
SHOULD TAKE LIGHTLY [inaudible]

02:59:51.113 --> 02:59:54.083
AND I AM [inaudible]

02:59:54.150 --> 02:59:56.552
SO.

02:59:56.619 --> 02:59:58.053
I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

02:59:58.120 --> 02:59:58.654
THAT WE HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY.

02:59:58.721 --> 03:00:00.356
I AM.

03:00:00.422 --> 03:00:01.991
AT EARLY STAGE BECAUSE THIS BILL

03:00:02.057 --> 03:00:03.359
BASICALLY SAYS THIS.

03:00:03.425 --> 03:00:05.895
CHARGE WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE.

03:00:05.961 --> 03:00:06.495
FOR CHARTER YOU HAVE PROBABLE

03:00:06.562 --> 03:00:07.830
CAUSE.

03:00:07.897 --> 03:00:09.031
FOR IF YOU DON'T HAVE PROBABLE

03:00:09.098 --> 03:00:10.065
CAUSE TODAY BUT YOU THINK YOU

03:00:10.132 --> 03:00:10.366
MIGHT LATER.

03:00:10.432 --> 03:00:12.168
WAIT.

03:00:12.234 --> 03:00:13.702
AND THEN YOU CAN CHARGE WHEN

03:00:13.769 --> 03:00:14.236
WHEN THE PROBABLE CAUSES

03:00:14.303 --> 03:00:16.772
REALIZED BUT DON'T OVER CHARGE

03:00:16.839 --> 03:00:17.940
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE IN A

03:00:18.007 --> 03:00:19.275
POSITION OF LEVERAGE.

03:00:19.341 --> 03:00:20.843
AND BETTER NEGOTIATING POWER AND

03:00:20.910 --> 03:00:21.777
HAVE A DEFENDANT OVER THE

03:00:21.844 --> 03:00:23.279
BARRELS THAT YOU CAN HAVE THEM

03:00:23.345 --> 03:00:24.346
TAKE A PLEA.

03:00:24.413 --> 03:00:26.115
ON SOMETHING TO GET YOUR CASE

03:00:26.182 --> 03:00:27.216
LOW DOWN.

03:00:27.283 --> 03:00:28.651
THAT'S NOT FAIR THAT'S NOT RIGHT

03:00:28.717 --> 03:00:29.218
WE KNOW OVER CHARGING IS A

03:00:29.285 --> 03:00:30.152
PROBLEM.

03:00:30.219 --> 03:00:33.923
THIS IS A MODEST PROPOSAL TO ASK

03:00:33.989 --> 03:00:35.491
A JUDGE IT WILL BE A NEUTRAL

03:00:35.558 --> 03:00:36.392
ARBITER.

03:00:36.458 --> 03:00:37.593
WHO WILL SEE EVIDENCE AND WILL

03:00:37.660 --> 03:00:39.028
DETERMINE WHETHER AT THAT MOMENT

03:00:39.094 --> 03:00:40.262
THERE'S PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THE

03:00:40.329 --> 03:00:42.298
CURRENT CHARGES -- AND IT WILL

03:00:42.364 --> 03:00:44.400
INCENT PROSECUTORS TO CHARGE

03:00:44.466 --> 03:00:45.467
WHAT THEY HAVE EVIDENCE FOR AND

03:00:45.534 --> 03:00:46.635
NOT TO CHARGE WHAT THEY DON'T

03:00:46.702 --> 03:00:47.736
HAVE EVIDENCE FOR BUT TO YOUR

03:00:47.803 --> 03:00:49.038
QUESTION THEY WILL HAVE THE

03:00:49.104 --> 03:00:50.406
OPPORTUNITY TO CHARGE AT A LATER

03:00:50.472 --> 03:00:51.373
TIME BUT THEY HAVE.

03:00:51.440 --> 03:00:54.176
PROBABLE CAUSE FOR AS THEIR

03:00:54.243 --> 03:01:00.082
INVESTIGATION CONTINUES.

03:01:00.149 --> 03:01:00.716
ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE

03:01:00.783 --> 03:01:02.418
QUESTIONS.

03:01:02.484 --> 03:01:05.287
A MISTER BONTA.

03:01:05.354 --> 03:01:07.890
YOU MAY CLOSE.

03:07:16.058 --> 03:07:17.526
CONSIDERABLE INVESTMENT.

03:07:17.593 --> 03:07:20.696
IN UPGRADE -- IF THE GROSS V.

TO AB -- SIXTEEN SIXTY NINE AS

03:08:46.882 --> 03:08:47.816
FAR AS THE CHANGES TO A

03:08:47.883 --> 03:08:48.817
CONFORMING GUN SHOWS FOR

03:08:48.884 --> 03:08:50.686
AMMUNITION PURCHASES WE FEEL

03:08:50.752 --> 03:08:52.487
THAT'S COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY --

03:08:52.554 --> 03:08:53.989
STATE AND FEDERAL LAW APPLY

03:08:54.056 --> 03:08:55.357
WHETHER YOU'RE AT A GUN SHOW OR

03:08:55.424 --> 03:08:57.025
AT A BRICK AND MORTAR AND SO WE

03:08:57.092 --> 03:08:58.293
FEEL THAT THAT PORTION OF THE

03:08:58.360 --> 03:09:00.062
BILL'S UNNECESSARY -- WITH THE

03:09:00.128 --> 03:09:02.531
AMENDMENTS TO AB SIXTEEN SIXTY

03:09:02.597 --> 03:09:05.333
NINE RECALL REGARDING -- DEROSE.

03:09:05.400 --> 03:09:07.202
THERE'S A LOT TO UNPACK WHEN IT

03:09:07.269 --> 03:09:08.737
COMES TO DROGO'S.

03:09:08.804 --> 03:09:09.938
AND I KNOW IT'S BEEN A VERY LONG

03:09:10.005 --> 03:09:13.341
DAY AND SOLD.

03:09:13.408 --> 03:09:14.509
DO MY BEST TO BE BRIEF.

03:09:14.576 --> 03:09:15.911
SO IF YOU YOU HEARD THAT THEY'RE

03:09:15.977 --> 03:09:17.312
LOOKING TO RECOVER THE JOKES

03:09:17.379 --> 03:09:19.347
COSTS IN AND COVER PAYMENTS I

03:09:19.414 --> 03:09:20.182
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND

03:09:20.248 --> 03:09:22.417
WHAT THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE

03:09:22.484 --> 03:09:24.019
DRUGS HE WAS AND I WAS TO COVER.

03:09:24.086 --> 03:09:25.721
BACKGROUND CHECKS AND THE

03:09:25.787 --> 03:09:27.889
TRANSFER REGISTRY -- OVER THE

03:09:27.956 --> 03:09:29.691
YEARS ESPECIALLY OVER THE LAST

03:09:29.758 --> 03:09:31.226
TWENTY YEARS WE'VE SEEN THIS

03:09:31.293 --> 03:09:33.628
DROVE THE GET OPENED UP TO ALL

03:09:33.695 --> 03:09:34.730
DIFFERENT KINDS OF X. X.

03:09:34.796 --> 03:09:36.264
EXPENDITURES TO PAY FOR ALL

03:09:36.331 --> 03:09:37.632
DIFFERENT TYPES OF DOJ

03:09:37.699 --> 03:09:39.201
ACTIVITIES.

03:09:39.267 --> 03:09:42.304
AND SO I'D BE CURIOUS. TO SEE --

03:09:42.370 --> 03:09:44.740
WHAT IS EACH PROGRAM WITHIN --

03:09:44.806 --> 03:09:46.942
THE DROSS IS CURRENTLY PAYING --

03:09:47.008 --> 03:09:48.777
FOR COSTING.

03:09:48.844 --> 03:09:50.679
YOU KNOW WE WE KNOW THAT DE

03:09:50.746 --> 03:09:52.781
DEROSE ACCOUNT HAS AMASSED A

03:09:52.848 --> 03:09:54.616
SURPLUS IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS

03:09:54.683 --> 03:09:56.451
OF DOLLARS BECAUSE WE BORROWED

03:09:56.518 --> 03:09:57.652
FROM THE DRUGS ACCOUNT TO TRY IN.

03:09:57.719 --> 03:10:00.021
A REDUCE THE APP'S BACKLOG WHICH

03:10:00.088 --> 03:10:02.324
IS A CONVERSATION FOR ANOTHER

03:10:02.390 --> 03:10:04.392
DAY -- BUT WE WE SAW THAT

03:10:04.459 --> 03:10:06.628
ACCOUNT HIT RECORD HIGHS AND NOW

03:10:06.695 --> 03:10:07.729
FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE

03:10:07.796 --> 03:10:09.364
HEARD THAT THE DRUGS ACCOUNTED

03:10:09.431 --> 03:10:10.999
STRUCTURALLY IMBALANCE.

03:10:11.066 --> 03:10:11.967
AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT

03:10:12.033 --> 03:10:13.635
OF STRANGE PUT BEING PUT ON THE

03:10:13.702 --> 03:10:16.438
OJ -- BUT RIGHT NOW WE KNOW THAT.

03:10:16.505 --> 03:10:17.806
IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE HISTORY

03:10:17.873 --> 03:10:19.441
OF FIREARMS SALES ESPECIALLY

03:10:19.508 --> 03:10:22.444
OVER THE LAST. SEVEN YEARS HERE

03:10:22.511 --> 03:10:22.811
IN CALIFORNIA.

03:10:22.878 --> 03:10:23.478
AND IN THE PERIOD WHEN WE HAD

03:10:23.545 --> 03:10:27.382
THAT SURPLUS THERE WAS TWENTY

03:10:27.449 --> 03:10:28.016
THIRTY FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN

03:10:28.083 --> 03:10:28.617
ADDRESS ACCOUNT.

03:10:28.683 --> 03:10:29.718
THE GUN SALES ARE NOT NEARLY AS

03:10:29.785 --> 03:10:30.285
HIGH AS THEY ARE NOW FOR THE

03:10:30.352 --> 03:10:31.987
LAST. SEVEN YEARS WE SOLD AT

03:10:32.053 --> 03:10:34.055
LEAST EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND

03:10:34.122 --> 03:10:35.090
FIREARMS PER YEAR IN THE STATE

03:10:35.157 --> 03:10:37.459
OF CALIFORNIA -- WHICH IS ALMOST

03:10:37.526 --> 03:10:38.960
DOUBLE WHAT WE WERE SELLING JUST

03:10:39.027 --> 03:10:40.362
A FEW YEARS SHORT YEARS AGO WHEN

03:10:40.428 --> 03:10:41.229
WE WERE HAVING.

03:10:41.296 --> 03:10:43.131
THE SURPLUS I ALSO THINK IT'S

03:10:43.198 --> 03:10:45.801
IMPORTANT NOTE THAT -- BACK IN

03:10:45.867 --> 03:10:46.368
TWO THOUSAND TEN THERE WAS A

03:10:46.434 --> 03:10:48.236
PROPOSED RULE FOR THE DATE

03:10:48.303 --> 03:10:50.939
ACTUALLY REDUCE THE DRAWS COSTS --

03:10:51.006 --> 03:10:52.574
TO BETTER REFLECT -- THEIR

03:10:52.641 --> 03:10:55.043
ACTUAL COSTS I'M THE RULE NEVER

03:10:55.110 --> 03:10:55.877
WENT THROUGH BUT THEY WERE

03:10:55.944 --> 03:10:57.913
LOOKING AT TAKING IT FROM

03:10:57.979 --> 03:10:58.847
NINETEEN DOLLARS BACK DOWN TO I

03:10:58.914 --> 03:11:00.382
BELIEVE FIFTEEN OR FOURTEEN

03:11:00.448 --> 03:11:02.417
DOLLARS -- BECAUSE HE SAID EVEN

03:11:02.484 --> 03:11:03.618
THOUGH THEY'RE PROCESSING MORE

03:11:03.685 --> 03:11:05.220
TRANSACTIONS THEIR SYSTEMS ARE

03:11:05.287 --> 03:11:06.888
IMPROVED OBVIOUSLY AS WE'VE

03:11:06.955 --> 03:11:08.056
ENTERED IN THE DIGITAL AGE A LOT

03:11:08.123 --> 03:11:09.491
OF THIS IS.

03:11:09.558 --> 03:11:11.026
IS GETTING QUICKER -- MORE

03:11:11.092 --> 03:11:13.829
AUTOMATED I'M IN SO.

03:11:13.895 --> 03:11:15.096
WE'RE WE'RE STRONG OPPOSITION

03:11:15.163 --> 03:11:16.932
THIS IS JUST ANOTHER TAX ON GUN

03:11:16.998 --> 03:11:19.201
OWNERS TO TO FOOT THE BILL --

03:11:19.267 --> 03:11:20.836
FOR ALL THESE PROGRAMS DEROSE IS

03:11:20.902 --> 03:11:22.370
NEVER BEEN SUBJECT TO AN AUDIT

03:11:22.437 --> 03:11:24.039
THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL REQUEST OF

03:11:24.105 --> 03:11:25.941

DRAWS PROGRAM.

03:11:28.143 --> 03:11:29.845
AND I THINK THAT BEFORE WE

03:11:29.911 --> 03:11:32.080
SHOULD EVEN CONSIDER DOUBLING

03:11:32.147 --> 03:11:33.448
THE JUROS FEE.

03:11:33.515 --> 03:11:34.416
THERE NEEDS TO BE A SERIOUS

03:11:34.482 --> 03:11:35.984
INQUIRY INTO WHERE THOSE MONIES

03:11:36.051 --> 03:11:36.885

GOING INTO THAT ACCOUNT HOW MUCH

03:11:41.223 --> 03:11:43.191
COSTS JUST TO PERFORM THE BASIC
