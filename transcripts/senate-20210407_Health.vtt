THE DAY OF MY APPOINTMENT I

00:34:01.839 --> 00:34:02.807
LEARNED THAT UNDER MY

COMMERCIAL INSURANCE POLICY I

00:34:05.042 --> 00:34:06.778

00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:24.429
WOULD BE. I WAS FORCED TO MAKE

00:34:24.495 --> 00:34:25.830
AN IMPOSSIBLE DECISION THAT DAY

00:34:25.897 --> 00:34:27.632

BODIES AND THEIR OWN LIVES AND

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.682
NOT HAVE OTHER PEOPLE MAKE

00:54:12.749 --> 00:54:16.252

00:54:42.145 --> 00:54:44.014
SIGNIFICANT COST SHARING

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:47.717
REQUIREMENTS THAT. THAT'S JUST

00:54:47.784 --> 00:54:49.586
PREVENT PEOPLE FROM ACCESSING

00:54:49.653 --> 00:54:51.588
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES SO

00:54:51.655 --> 00:54:52.756

CHAIRMAN. SO WE HAVE. I THINK

00:55:12.275 --> 00:55:14.844
ALL WE HAVE A- I THINK CERTAIN

00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:16.279
THINGS COME TO MIND WHEN WE

00:55:16.346 --> 00:55:18.982
THINK ABOUT HEALTH CARE WHAT IS

00:55:19.049 --> 00:55:21.384
HEALTH CARE IT'S GETTING CANCER

00:55:21.451 --> 00:55:23.353
TREATMENT IT'S GETTING YOUR

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:25.455
COVERED TESTING IT GETTING YOUR

00:55:25.522 --> 00:55:27.057
EYES EXAMINED IT'S A NUMBER OF

00:55:27.123 --> 00:55:28.358
THINGS ONE OF THE THINGS IT

00:55:28.425 --> 00:55:31.027
DOES NOT COME TO MY MIND. IS AN

00:55:31.094 --> 00:55:33.997
ELECTIVE SURGERY THAT TAKES THE

00:55:34.064 --> 00:55:35.865
LIFE OF ANOTHER HUMAN BEING SO

00:55:35.932 --> 00:55:37.801
I'M NOT CERTAIN WHY THE

00:55:37.867 --> 00:55:40.470
ANALYSIS CONTINUES TO REFER TO

00:55:40.537 --> 00:55:42.906
ABORTION AS HEALTH CARE BECAUSE

00:55:42.972 --> 00:55:45.175
IT'S NOT HEALTH CARE IT'S AN

00:55:45.241 --> 00:55:47.043
ELECTIVE SURGERY- IT'S NOT A

00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:49.079
REQUIREMENT IS AN ENTIRELY

00:55:49.145 --> 00:55:52.315
VOLUNTARY AND JUST LIKE IF

00:55:52.382 --> 00:55:56.853
SOMEONE. GOES TO- HAVE THEIR

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:59.422

00:55:59.489 --> 00:56:01.458
OR YOU KNOW PICK SOME OTHER

00:56:01.524 --> 00:56:03.293
TYPE OF ELECTIVE SURGERY HAVE

00:56:03.359 --> 00:56:04.694
TO PAY FOR IT THERE ARE CERTAIN

00:56:04.761 --> 00:56:06.262
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH GETTING

00:56:06.329 --> 00:56:08.898
THAT TYPE OF SURGERY BECAUSE IT

00:56:08.965 --> 00:56:11.067
IS AN ELECTIVE SURGERY. SAID

00:56:11.134 --> 00:56:13.837
GIVEN THE NUMBER OF FINANCIAL

00:56:13.903 --> 00:56:15.638
CONSTRAINTS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS

00:56:15.705 --> 00:56:17.741
GIVEN THE NUMBER OF FINANCIAL

00:56:17.807 --> 00:56:18.875
BURDENS THIS STATE HAS

00:56:18.942 --> 00:56:21.544
EXPERIENCED JUST OVER THE LAST

00:56:21.611 --> 00:56:23.513
YEAR NOT TO MENTION IN. YOU

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:24.914
KNOW PREVIOS YEARS IN THE

00:56:24.981 --> 00:56:27.083
FUTURE OF. THE TYPES OF THINGS

00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:28.985
WE WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR AND

00:56:29.052 --> 00:56:29.552
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE

00:56:29.619 --> 00:56:31.287
GOING TO PAY FOR THEM. ALL

00:56:31.354 --> 00:56:33.456
REASONABLE COSTS- I DON'T

00:56:33.523 --> 00:56:35.058
BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD THE AS A

00:56:35.125 --> 00:56:37.660
STATE SHOULD BE FORCING PEOPLE

00:56:37.727 --> 00:56:40.029
TO PAY FOR SERVICES THAT THEY

00:56:40.096 --> 00:56:42.465
ONLY AND DON'T AGREE WITH

00:56:42.532 --> 00:56:43.700
EITHER FROM A MORAL OR

00:56:43.767 --> 00:56:45.502
RELIGIOUS SPACE PERSPECTIVE.

00:56:45.568 --> 00:56:47.303
BUT ALSO SHOULDN'T BE FORCED TO

00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:49.472
PAY FOR- THERE'S A CERTAIN

00:56:49.539 --> 00:56:52.509
LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY AND

00:56:52.575 --> 00:56:55.145
THAT COMES ALONG AND I THINK IF

00:56:55.211 --> 00:56:58.882
SOMEONE MAKES- THE CHOICE. TO

00:56:58.948 --> 00:57:00.250
HAVE AN ABORTION THAT IS THEIR

00:57:00.316 --> 00:57:02.952
CHOICE BY LAW BUT I DON'T THINK

00:57:03.019 --> 00:57:04.721
WE SHOULD BE MAKING IT- I

00:57:04.788 --> 00:57:06.790
FINANCIAL BURDEN FOR THOSE WHO

00:57:06.856 --> 00:57:08.391
DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH

00:57:08.458 --> 00:57:10.426
THAT CHOICE BECAUSE AGAIN. THIS

00:57:10.493 --> 00:57:14.097
IS AN ELECTIVE SURGERY- THIS IS

00:57:14.164 --> 00:57:16.065
THIS IS DOES NOT FALL UNDER THE

00:57:16.132 --> 00:57:18.902
CATEGORY- OF HEALTH CARE IS WE

00:57:18.968 --> 00:57:20.703
ORDINARILY WOULD CONSIDER IT SO

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:25.208

00:57:45.328 --> 00:57:47.897
SHARING. THE RAND- INSURANCE

00:57:47.964 --> 00:57:49.699

00:57:49.766 --> 00:57:50.934
THEY'RE ALSO PLACES WHERE

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.135
CARSHARING DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

00:57:52.202 --> 00:57:54.204

THE VARIANCE WE ARE CONCERNED I

01:56:50.136 --> 01:56:51.738
THINK BY TEN DOES NOT ESTABLISH

WHAT CONSTITUTES A REASONABLE

01:57:07.220 --> 01:57:08.488
RATE. WE WOULD RECOMMEND

01:57:08.554 --> 01:57:10.556
CONSIDERING THE MEDICARE RATE.

01:57:10.623 --> 01:57:12.392
