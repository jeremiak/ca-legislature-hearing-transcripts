THAT MANDATORY HEARING ON PROPOSED BALLOT INITIATIVE CALLED THE DIVISION OF CALIFORNIA INTO THREE STATES. THE REASON THAT WE'RE HERE AND THIS IS A JOINT HEARING WITH THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY IN THE SET SENATE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION HAPPY TO WELCOME. A COLLEAGUE SENATOR BILL DODD WHO IS THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE. TO US. TO THIS HEARING HERE TODAY. ACT IT'S CALIFORNIA LAW THAT EVERY BALLOT MEASURE ONCE IT GETS AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE VOTES AND PRIOR TO A HUNDRED THIRTY ONE DAYS I BELIEVE IT IS FROM THE ELECTION. WHICH IN THIS CASE MEANS. JUNE TWENTY EIGHTH THAT THE LEGISLATURE HOLDS A HEARING ON A BALLOT MEASURE THAT IS TO BE PUT ON THE BALLOT BY SIGNATURE. THIS BALLOT MEASURE IT QUALIFIES AT LEAST FOR THAT IT IS. EVIDENTY GUARDED AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE PRCENT OF THE REQUIRED SIGNATURES SO WE NEED TO HOLD THIS HEARING HERE SOON. AND TODAY WAS THE DAY THAT WE SCHEDULED AT THE HEARING ABOUT DISAPPOINTED TO REPORT THAT THE PROPONENTS THOUGH INVITED DECLINED TO COME. AND IT'S TOO BAD THAT I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHY. THEY PROPOSED A BALLOT MEASURE SPENT ALL THAT MONEY TWO QUICK SIGNATURES AND REFUSED TO BE HERE TO TO EVEN BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT IT. SINCE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING ABOUT A BALLOT MEASURE AND GIVEN THE. ECONOMIC AND THE LEGAL AND THE SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF. BREAKING THE STATE INTO THREE SEPARATE STATES. THEY TO NOT HAVE A PROPONENT HERE IS A LITTLE FRUSTRATING AND. IN MY VIEW A LITTLE BIT SURPRISING BUT NEVERTHELESS WE ARE OBLIGATED TO MOVE FORWARD WE'RE GOING HOLD HEARINGS WE'VE GIVEN EVERYBODY AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO DO TO COME AND JOIN US AND. HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE ABLE TO. THAT THIS IN ARE APPROPRIATE WAYS AND THEN BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD SENATOR YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE YEAH BRIEFLY AT FIRST LIKE TO THANK THE. CHAIRMAN STONE IN THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR PUTTING THE SONGS PRETTY BUSY. TIME SO WELL KEEP IT BRIEF I TOO AM DISAPPOINTED THAT THAT PROPONENTS OF THE INITIATIVE COULD NOT BE HERE TO DISCUSS WHAT THEY FEEL ARE. IMPORTANT BENEFITS TO BREAKING UP THE STATE. INTO THREESEPARATE STATES HOWEVER I'M HOPEFUL THAT THE LA ARE WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE OUR COMMITTEES WITH INSIGHT ON. HOW THIS PROCESS WOULD WORK AND THE MANY CHALLENGES? THAT THIS INITIATIVE I PRESENTS. A LET ME THANK IN ADVANCE THE WITNESSES FOR BEING HERE. IF THE LA A O. COULD COME FORWARD NOW SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN THIS HEARING OKAY LET'S INVITE A PAIR OF THE THE WHOLE PANEL. WE HAVE AND HAULING SAID SENIOR FISCAL OPEN UP AND POLICY ANALYST FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. TIM DRAPER WAS INVITED WHOSE THE INITIATIVE PROPONENTS AND LAUREN QUE FROM THE CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION FOR COMEDIAN. AND EDUCATION AND INITIATIVE OF OPPONENTS. AND ONCE WE HAVE THE SPEAKERS THEN YOU'RE YOU'RE WELCOME TO SIT THERE BUT I WOULD JUST MOVE THAT. YEAH. WE WILL THEN HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT CLOSING COMMENTS. AND MOVE ON WITH THEIR DAY RIGHT PLEASE FROM THE LA OUT. I THINK YOU CHEN MEMBERS AND HOLLINGS HAD FROM LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. I'M SO ME JUST BEGIN WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT AROUND OUR OFFICE'S ROLE. IN THE INITIATIVE PROCESS AND THEN ALSO IN THIS HEARING SPECIFICALLY. SO PROPOSITION NINE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR GAVE OUR OFFICE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO CONDUCT IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF ALL STATEWIDE INITIATIVES. AND AS SUCH ARE WE DO NOT TAKE A POSITION OR OFFER ANY RECOMMENDATIONS. ON. PROPOSITION ANALYSES THAT IT MAY BE A BIT DIFFERENT. IN THIS HEARINGS CONTACTS JOB VERSES. BOB VERSUS OUR ROLE IN THE BUDGET PROCESS WHERE WE DO OFFER ANALYSIS AND COMMENTARY. IN ADDITION I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT THIS INITIATIVE INVOLVES A NUMBER OF LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS. THESE ARE YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY COMPLEX IN THIS CONTEXT WE ARE NOT LAWYERS ALTHOUGH WE DID CONSULT WITH LAWYERS AS WE PUT TOGETHER OUR ANALYSIS. SO IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO IT. YOU KNOW ADDRESS SOME OF THE MORE THORNY COMPLEX LEGAL ISSUES THAT ARE POSED BY THIS INITIATIVE. SO. THIS INITIATIVE PROPOSES PUTTING CALIFORNIA INTO THREE SEPARATE STATES BEFORE I TALK ABOUT THE PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY WHAT BE JUST BOB BRIEFLY ADDRESS SOME. SOME LEGAL BACKGROUND HERE. I SO FIRST ON INITIATIVE PROCESS. CALIFORNIA GIVES THE VOTERS THE POWER TO EXERCISE SOME BUT NOT ALL OF THE LEGISLATURE'S INITIATIVE PROCESS. POWERS THROUGH THE INITIATIVE PROCESS FOR EXAMPLE VOTERS CAN CREATE AND I CHANGE LAWS THROUGH THE INITIATIVE PROCESS BUT THEY CANNOT EXERCISE OTHER LEGISLATIVE POWERS FOR EXAMPLE ON COURTS HAVE FOUND THAT THE VOTERS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO EXERCISE LEGISLATURE'S POWER TO ADVISE. OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS THROUGH THE INITIATIVE PROCESS. SECOND. ON THE U. S. CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION SO ARTICLE FOUR OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION PROVIDES THE PROCESS UP BY WHICH A NEW STATE COULD BE ADMITTED TO THE UNION EITHER BY SPLITTING FROM AN EXISTING STATE OR OR A WHOLLY NEW STATE IN GENERAL. AND HISTORICALLY FOUR STATES HAVE BEEN ADMITTED TO THE UNION AFTER BEING SPLIT FROM EXISTING STATES. IN EACH OF THESE CASES. UNDER THE REQUIREMENTS OF ARTICLE FOR. BOTH CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL IS REQUIRED AND THEN THE APPROVAL OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE LEGISLATURE'S INVOLVED IT'S REQUIRED. IN EACH OF THE FOUR HISTORICAL EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATIVE BODY WAS THE ENTITY THAT PROVIDED THAT APPROVAL. AND THERE IS NO CLEAR HISTORICAL PRECEDENT OR COURT RULING THAT SAYS THAT THE VOTERS CAN PROVIDE THAT APPROVAL THAT'S NECESSARY UNDER ARTICLE FORM. SO THIS INITIATIVE PROPOSES TO SPLIT CALIFORNIA INTO THREE STATES. THESE NEW STATES WOULD BE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WHICH WOULD SPAN FROM THE OREGON BORDER DOWN ON TO SANTA CRUZ THEN THERE WOULD BE CALIFORNIA WHICH WOULD BE MOST OF THE COASTAL STATES I'VE ALL ALL OF THE COASTAL STATES FROM MODERATE TO LOS ANGELES COUNTIES. AND THEN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHICH WOULD STRETCH FROM ORANGE AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY. THROUGH. MUCH OF THE REST OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THE MEASURE ALSO AIMS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED STATE LEGISLATIVE CONSENT ARDEN UNDER. ARTICLE FOUR OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. SO I'M CLEARLY THERE ARE SEVERAL LEGAL ISSUES THAT ARE RAISED BY THIS MEASURE FIRST ON UNITED STATES CONSTITUTIONAL SIDE WHETHER. THIS IS. ALLOWABLE. USE OF PASSWORD ALLOWABLE APPROVAL PROCESS UNDER ARTICLE FOR THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND THAT ALSO UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE THE QUESTION WOULD BE WHETHER THIS IT IS AN ALLOWABLE USE OF THE VOTERS INITIATIVE POWER. THOSE ARE BOTH ISSUES. THE COURTS THEMSELVES WOULD HAVE TO RESOLVE SO EVEN IF THE MEASURES APPROVED BY VOTERS AND THEN APPROVED BY COURTS. WE FIND THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE ANY DIRECT FISCAL EFFECTS AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL IN ORDER TO TAKE EFFECT. CONGRESS COULD DECIDE OUGHT NOT TO APPROVE THE REQUEST COULD APPROVE THE REQUEST AS PROPOSED OR CONGRESS COULD APPROVE A DIFFERENCE BUT OF THE STATE STAY INTO TWO. DIFFERENT PIECES. IN THAT CASE HE WOULD RETURN TO CALIFORNIA FOR APPROVAL BY THE LEGISLATURE. SO FINALLY I AM IF THE SPLIT DID OCCUR SO IF VOTERS APPROVED IT BOB IT WAS ALLOWED BY THE COURTS AND CONGRESS PER. APPROVED IT AS PROPOSED THEN. THERE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT POLICY AND LEGAL QUESTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE TO ADDRESS. BOTH THE EXISTING STATE LEGISLATURE AND THEN THE LEGISLATURE'S OF THE NEW STATES WOULD HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS AROUND HOW TO DIVIDE CALIFORNIA'S ARM. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HOW TO DIVIDE ITS EXISTING PENSION DIED ITS DEBT TO EXTERNAL BOND HOLDERS. AS WELL AS MANY OTHER COMPLEX ISSUES THAT WOULD NEED TO BE RESOLVED BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU AND I'D ALSO POINT OUT THE BACK ON PAPER I THINK GOES THROUGH PRETTY EXHAUSTIVE LIST OF SOME OF THE OTHER. LOCATIONS THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE SORTED OUT. TO CATCH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER CHAIRMAN. A CONSULTANT SAID THANK YOU FOR A INVITING ME A AS YOU KNOW THAT I'M LAURIN QUE I'M PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION FOR COMMERCE AND EDUCATION OR A THINK TANK AFFILIATED WITH CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. UP OUR BOARD CAL CHAMBER BOARD LAST MONTH VOTED TO OPPOSE THE THREE STATES MEASURE FOR THREE REASONS. DISINGENUOUS IT'S DISTRACTING. AND IF IT'S IMPLEMENTED IT'S DANGEROUS. SO FOR ALL OUR SUCCESSES IN IN CALIFORNIAN FOR THE WONDER THAT WERE HELD. GLOBALLY. WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE MANY PROBLEMS. AND NOBODY KNOWS THIS BETTER THAN YOU. YOU HEAR ABOUT IT FROM YOUR CONSTITUENTS FROM. ARE YOUR COLLEAGUES AND FROM. A US IN THE. AMONG THE ORGANIZED INTERESTS. BUT FOR ANYBODY WHO'S BEEN HERE FOR MORE THAN A WEEK AND A HALF. YOU REALIZE THAT IF YOU'RE SINCERELY COMMITTED TO FIXING ANY OF THESE PROBLEMS. YOU FIX THE PROBLEM. DIVISION INTO THREE STATES DOESN'T FIX ANY PROBLEMS. IT MAKES ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS OBJECTIVELY WORSE. IN THE HOPE THAT SOMEONE WHO'S MORE ENLIGHTENED AND MORE PRACTICAL THAN THE AUTHOR. WILL EVENTUALLY COME AROUND AND REALLY FINALLY FIX THE. SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU A A PARTIAL LIST OF THE. BILLS THAT THE PROPONENT. HAS IDENTIFIED ON HIS WEBSITE THAT BESET CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA RANKS LAST IN THE COUNTRY IN HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATES NEAR THE BOTTOM IN HIGH PRIORITY SUBJECTS LIKE MATH CALIFORNIA'S HIGHWAYS BRIDGES FREEWAYS AND CITY ROADS. ARE RANKED AMONG THE POOREST IN THE NATION CALIFORNIANS PAY THE HIGHEST TAXES IN THE NATION AND YET OUR TAX DOLLARS ARE MISMANAGED IN EVERY WAY. THE CURRENT OVERCROWDING AND. UNDER FUNDED PRISON SYSTEM IS FAILING CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE REGIONS REQUIRE GOVERNMENT ATTENTION THE TO SPECIFICALLY TAILORED TO ADDRESS. THE AREA'S NEEDS. SO FROM HIS WEBSITE WE'RE YOU CAN QUIBBLE LISTA DEGREE BUT YES THESE ARE ALL PROBLEMS THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON. EVERYDAY THAT WE TALK ABOUT. THAT THERE'S A BIG CONVERSATION GOES ON IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT THESE. A PROBLEMS. WE NEED TO ADDRESS AND MAKE CALIFORNIA VOTER STATE AS FOR THIS INITIATIVE THOUGH IT DOES NOTHING TO ADVANCE A SOLUTION ANY OF THESE PROBLEMS IT DOESN'T ADD A NEW TEACHER. IT DOESN'T REFORM ANY SCHOOL REGULATIONS. IT DOESN'T. ARE AND ANY MONEY TO THE ROADS IT DOESN'T TAKE A SINGLE A CAR OFF OF THE. HIGHWAYS IT DOESN'T A AT ANY PRISON BUT BEDS MODIFY. ANY SENTENCES. OF RAZOR REDUCE ANY TAXES ARE CENTRAL CHALLENGE IS TO. RECONCILE THE PLURALISTIC DEMANDS OF DIVERSE INTERESTS. IN A DYNAMIC NATION STATE. AND ADVANCE THE OVERALL WELFARE FOR CITIZENRY THIS INITIATIVE. REQUIRES THAT SURRENDER. TO THIS TEST IS A BETTER OPTION. THEN RISING TO THAT CHALLENGE. IT'S DISINGENUOUS TO SUGGEST A VOTERS. THAT THE MEASURE IS A SOLUTION TO OF VARIETY OF HILLS WHEN IT ACCOMPLISHES NO MORE. THAN TRIED DRAWING TWO MORE LINES ON THE MAP OF THE UNITED STATES. SO RATHER THAN SEEKING TO SOLVE THE REAL PROBLEMS BEFORE AS THE MEASURE INSTEAD CREATES AN ENTIRELY NEW SUITE OF PROBLEMS TO DISTRACT AND CONSUME VOTERS. POLITICAL LEADERS LIKE YOURSELVES CONCERNED CITIZENS AN ORDINARY RESIDENTS. AT. CALIFORNIANS. OF US SADLY DON'T. ALWAYS EXHIBIT A ROBUST BANDWIDTH FOR CONSIDERING STATE ISSUES. WHAT WAS THE TURNOUT AT YESTERDAY'S PRIMARY ELECTION? WE WAS EVEN FORTY PERCENT OF. I'M NOT SURE. HOPEFULLY WILL BE MORE IN IN NOVEMBER. BUT. TRULY THE LAST THING WE NEED ON THE BALLOT WE GET INVOLVED IN A LOT ABOUT STATEWIDE BALLOT MEASURES PROBABLY. PROBABLY NO. THE LAST THING WE NEED ON THIS BALLOT. IS A MEASURE OF ITS INFAMOUS. SOLELY FOR ITS AUDACITY. OUR LIMITED CAPACITY TO DISCUSS IMPORTANT CONSEQUENTIAL ISSUES LIKE HOUSING AND POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS TAXES INFRASTRUCTURE. WE'LL BE CROWDED OUT BY A POINTLESS SPECULATION AND DEBATE. OVER AN UNLIKELY EVENT THAT NOBODY IN ANY RESPONSIBLE POSITIONS EVER SUGGESTED. EVEN IF YOU AGREE THE CALIFORNIA'S MUST MAKE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES TO OUR GOVERNMENT SUCH AS. SUCH AN EXISTENTIAL CHANGE SHOULD NOT BE THE SUBJECT OF A SIMPLISTIC BALLOT MEASURE. AS OUR. REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S SAID THIS IS. OF BALLOT MEASURES ARE NOT NECESSARILY. THE. CORRECT OR APPROVED. OF METHOD FOR EVERY OF MATTER YES THE PEOPLE STAND IN THE SHOES OF THE LEGISLATURE. WHEN THEY VOTE ON. OUR INITIATIVES. BUT THEY CANNOT REVISE THE CONSTITUTION. THEY CANNOT MAKE WHOLESALE CHANGES. THAT. EVEN EVEN BY OF OF BALLOT INITIATIVE THAT'S A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL REVISION PROCESS. IN THE CONSTITUTION NOT COURSE WE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE SO WHO KNOWS. BUT THERE ARE THAT THERE ARE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING IS MORE APPROPRIATE IF YOU WERE. SO DELUDED AS TO THINK IT WAS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE EXPLORED. OF THAT THE LEGISLATURE ITSELF SHOULD DO OR YOU SHOULD HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL REVISION COMMISSION TO CONSIDER. SO FINALLY. AND SOMEWHAT RELUCTANTLY ALL SPEND A FEW MINUTES DWELLING ON THE PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF BREAKING CALIFORNIAN TO PIECES. THE. CHALLENGES ARE STARTING TO SAY THE LEAST FOR REDISTRIBUTION OF STATE ASSETS ASSIGNMENT OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT TO MENTION. ADDRESSING THE INHERENT INEQUITIES THAT WILL ARISE FROM ARBITRARY GEOGRAPHICAL DIVISION OF ECONOMIC FINANCIAL PHYSICAL. AND CULTURAL PATRIMONY HAS. AND IT LOOKED LIKE YOU I'D LIKE TO COMMEND. THE STAFF REPORT OR STAFF REPORTS THAT WERE OF DONE FOR THE COMMITTEE AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S. IS THE PRICE OF FROM THERE. THEIR THOROUGH. BUT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE JUST A SAMPLING OF WHAT WE. WHAT YOU WOULD FACE? SHOULD THIS INITIATIVE PASS AND SHOULD THE CONGRESS AGREED TO SET MOTION DIVISION TO THREE CALIFORNIANS. FIRST OF ALL. WITH WITH WITH. RESPECT TO THE. TO THE. STATEMENT THAT THERE'S NO DIRECT COST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TRUE THERE'S NO. SUBSTANTIAL DIRECT COST OF SENDING A LETTER TO CONGRESS WHICH IS REALLY WHAT THIS. MEASURE. DOES. BUT IT'S IT'S DISINGENUOUS AND REALLY A DISSERVICE TO THE TO THE VOTERS TO. TO TO NOT. A LAYOUT AT LEAST WHAT THE INITIAL COSTS WOULD BE IF THIS WAS TO BE ADOPTED AND. I'LL JUST SIT HERE AND AND. AND. REQUEST THAT WHEN YOU DO PUBLISHER FINAL FISCAL ANALYSIS THAT YOU DO A CONSIDER SOME OF THESE. BECAUSE THE VOTERS TO READ THE BALLOT PAMPHLET THAT'S ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE. THEY DO GET INFORMATION. BUT IF THE IF THE IT IF THE CONGRESS WERE TO APPROVE SUCH A. THE PROCESS. WELL FIRST THE ORIGINAL STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WILL BE OBLIGATED TO SPEND TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON ESTABLISHMENT OF. THREE CONVENTIONS IN EACH OF THE NEW PROTESTATIONS. TO DIVIDE THE CONSTITUTION AND A SET OF LAWS. THIS WOULD REQUIRE DELEGATE SELECTION PROCESS MEETING STAFF LEGAL SUPPORT NOT REACH COURSE THE STATE WOULD. AS YOU SUGGESTED THE STATE WOULD HAVE TO DEFEND. AGAINST VIGOROUSLY LITIGATION ON THE VALIDITY OF THE MEASURE. ALLEN MANY ASPECTS OF THE PROCESS THAT COMES OUT OF IT. SECOND EACH OF THE THREE NEW STATES. BECOME START OF VENTURES REQUIRING. ELECTION OF NEW STATEWIDE AND LEGISLATIVE OFFICIALS APPOINTMENT OF NEW EXECUTIVE BRANCH OFFICERS NEW RECRUITMENT AND HIRING STATE OF STAFF APPOINTMENT OF NEW. PRISON GRANTEES ADOPTION OF NEW CODES GOVERNMENT CODE CIVIL CODE. TAX CODE CRIMINAL QUOTE ALL OF THAT. MAYBE NEW CENSUS. DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. AND THEN THE FUN BEGINS THAT'S THAT'S JUST ALL THE BASIC MINIMUM TO GET THE STRUCTURE IN PLACE. AGAIN I POINT TO THE STAFF REPORT WHICH GOES INTO. GREAT DETAIL ON THIS BUT. BUT JUST OF. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THAT SOME OF THE KEY. QUESTIONS ABOUT DIVIDING THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ALL CALIFORNIA. WOULD INCLUDE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS TUITION POLICIES FOR THE INCUMBENT STUDENTS. ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES ESTIMATED THAT THE COST OF THE STUDENTS FOR. AS A RESULT OF OUT OF STATE TUITION COULD BE IN THE ORDER TWO BILLION DOLLARS. RESPONSIBILITIES FOR PRISONERS DOMICILED IN ONE STATE. WHO WERE COMMITTED FROM ANOTHER? RESPONSIBILITY FOR FOR PAYMENT OF WATER POWER AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE ASSETS LOCATED ONE STATE. SERVE THE RESIDENTS OF ANOTHER STATE. OF COURSE MOST NOTORIOUSLY THE RESPONSIBILITY THE WATER DELIVERY SYSTEMS. MOST OF THE NEW. CALIFORNIA. THAT'S THE. LA BASED STATE. AND MUCH OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S WATER SUPPLIES ARE LOCATED WOULD BE LOCATED IN A DIFFERENT STATE MAY HAVE TO TRAVERSE EVEN A SECOND STATE TO REACH OUR ULTIMATE DESTINATION. OF. EACH NEW LEGISLATURE A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION WOULD HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT OF OUR POLTICAL LEGACY TO ADOPT TO REJECT WHAT ABOUT PROP THIRTEEN. THE FORTIETH BIRTHDAY OR PROP NINETY EIGHT. WILL THERE BE REAPPORTIONMENT COMMISSIONS DEATH PENALTY WOULD ANY OF THE HARD FOUGHT POLITICAL BATTLES THAT OCCURRED OVER THE DECADES. IN BALLOT MEASURES. WHETHER REFLECTING A. PREVAILING VICTORY OF THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT. OF WOULD THEY SURVIVE INTO THESE NEW REGIMES. AND THEN FINALLY WITH REGARD TO. THIS INTRIGUING AND. BIZARRE STATEMENT THAT. THE STATE LEGISLATURE FAILS TO REACH RESOLUTION OF DIVISION A TRANSFORMATION OF CALIFORNIA WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS. THEN DEBTS ARE DISTRIBUTED AMONG NEWLY CREATED STATES. BASED ON POPULATION PROPORTIONALLY SO JUST TO DECONSTRUCT THIS. IF SAY HALF OF THE G. O. BONDS. THE GEO BOND DEBT FOR SCHOOLS. LAWLER CHIO BONDS. IS IN THE NEW CALIFORNIA NEW LA BASED. WITH THE OTHER TWO STATES WITH EACH OF WOULD HAVE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF THE SCHOOLS. BE REQUIRED TO PAY A THIRD OF THE DEBT AND LIKEWISE SAFE FOR BUT PENSION. OBLIGATIONS. THE NEW CALIFORNIA HAS TWENTY PERCENT OF THE UC CAMPUSES AND TWENTY PERCENT OF THE UC. MEDICAL CENTERS BUT WOULD RESIDENTS OF THE NEW CALIFORNIA TO BE A THIRD. OF THE PENSION. DEBT. I DON'T KNOW. WELL AS YOU CAN SEE THIS EXERCISE MOVES QUICKLY FROM A SERIOUS POLICY ANALYSIS TO PARLOR GAME. A AND WITH THAT ALL. I'VE PROBABLY SPENT MORE THAN THEY SHOULD TO DIGNIFY THIS MEASURE. WITH THE. WITH THE DISCUSSION OF A BUT BUT THERE YOU GO HAPPY TO RESPOND AND. I THINK IF. QUESTIONS. VERY QUICKLY GREAT THANK YOU I'M GONNA. THAT OPEN UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS. IT'S HEARING. ALRIGHT SING NONE BRING IT BACK FOR. FINAL COMMENT CENTER. I APPRECIATE BOTH OF YOU BEING HERE I THINK YOU. ARTICULATED YOUR POSITION IS VERY VERY WELL AND. TIME WILL TELL THANK YOU YEAH. I I TWIST WAS POINTED OUT TO ME THAT CURRENTLY. VOTER TURNOUT IN OUR YESTERDAY'S ELECTION STANDS AT TWENTY ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT WAS. OF COURSE THERE HAVE TO DEAL BALLOTS AND OTHERS TO BE COUNTED SO OVER THE NEXT MONTH WILL. THAT WILL HOPEFULLY GO UP SUBSTANTIALLY BANG IT ONLY HAS SO FAR TO GO. PRETTY POOR TURNED OUT TO YOUR POINTS. EXACTLY AND I WILL JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT. PATTERN TWENTY LEGISLATORS WHO ARE HERE AND YES WE FIGHT FOR A DISTRICTS THAT WE FIGHT FOR CONSTITUENTS BUT. WE ALSO HAVE A MUCH BROADER SENSE OF WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE ENTIRE STATE. AND WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT AUTHORITY THAT WE HAVE. AND SO TO THINK ABOUT BREAKING THAT UP AND BREAKING IT DOWN WITH. A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT ACOSTA TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY. IS SOMETHING THAT I DON'T THINK THIS LEGISLATORS NOT A QUESTION I DON'T THINK INCOME OF THIS LEGISLATURE FOR THOSE REASONS AND FOR THE REASONS THAT WERE. THAT WERE ARTICULATED SOLD BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF THIS GETS ON THE BALLOT. AND. WHAT THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA REALLY WOULD HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S NOT OUR? QUESTION IT IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE RESPONDED TO FEDERALLY AND FORTUNATELY OR UNFORTUNATELY THEY SEEM TO BE INCAPABLE OF DOING MUCH OF THAT. BUT A WHAT WE SAID TO THEM. WHO KNOWS AND WE ARE YOU KNOW WE WE ARE GOVERNING AND YOU YOU POINT OUT THAT DIVIDES AND SOME OF THE POLITICAL QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE IN THE FIGHTS THAT WE HAVE? AND EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE STRONG DEMOCRATIC MAJORITIES WE ARE GOVERNING WE ARE GOVERNING IN A BIPARTISAN WAY PRIMARILY IN BOTH HOUSES AND HAVE OF VARIETY OF PERSPECTIVES AT THE TABLE AS WE DO POLICY AND. HOW HOW COULD ANYONE WANT TO BREAK? THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE BREAK IT UP THEN THEY MOVE TO SOMETHING ELSE SO I KNOW I THAT IS. THIS PRIORITY WITH THAT. I APPRECIATE SENATOR YOU BEING HERE PROCEED EVERYBODY BEING HERE APPRECIATE THE THE PANEL COME FORWARD AND LAY THIS OUT A LITTLE BIT AND THE GREAT WORK THAT WAS DONE TO. BUT AT WHAT THEIR POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS ARE WILL WE ILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS AND WE ARE ADJOURNED
