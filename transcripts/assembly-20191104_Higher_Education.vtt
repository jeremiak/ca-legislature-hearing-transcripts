EQUITY GAS. AND FACULTY

DIVERSITY IS ACTUALLY ONE OF

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.125
THE MOST PROMISING STRATEGIES

00:16:33.192 --> 00:16:36.929
IF NOT DE PROMISING STRATEGY

00:16:36.995 --> 00:16:39.198
THAT DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THE

00:16:39.264 --> 00:16:47.306
ISSUE OF RACE AND DIRECTLY.

00:16:47.373 --> 00:16:47.840
ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF THE

00:16:47.906 --> 00:16:54.947
RACIAL EQUITY. AND SO THIS IS

00:16:55.013 --> 00:16:55.581

MANY ANGLES BUT MOSTLY

00:17:02.087 --> 00:17:03.422
IMPORTANT FOR STUDENTS EQUITY

00:17:03.489 --> 00:17:04.056
AND THE RESEARCH AS YOU MENTION

00:17:04.123 --> 00:17:05.457
IS SHOWN AND I LIKE TO GO TO

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:07.226
OVER THAT RESEARCH A LITTLE BIT

00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:08.927
BECAUSE IT'S REALLY CRITICAL.

00:17:08.994 --> 00:17:11.029
AND THAT IS THAT STUDIES HAVE

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:13.165
SHOWN THE EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS

00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:17.169
OF A DIVERSE FACULTY NOW WE'VE

00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:19.138
SEEN A SURGE IN HIGHER ED IN

00:17:19.204 --> 00:17:21.540
OTHER SYSTEMS IN K. TWELVE- BUT

00:17:21.607 --> 00:17:23.108
THERE IS ACTUALLY EVEN RESEARCH

00:17:23.175 --> 00:17:25.110
IN A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY

00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:27.546
COLLEGE. AND THAT IS A RESEARCH

00:17:27.613 --> 00:17:29.114
THAT WAS DONE SEVERAL YEARS AGO

00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:31.150
AT DE ANZA COLLEGE WHO IS

00:17:31.216 --> 00:17:33.285
ACTUALLY CONDUCTED BY A AN

00:17:33.352 --> 00:17:35.454
ECONOMICS PROFESSOR. UC SANTA

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:37.156
CRUZ AND HE WAS COMING TO

00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:37.723
DENOUNCE THE TO JUST TAKE A

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.491
LOOK AT THEIR DATA TO TAKE A

00:17:39.558 --> 00:17:41.326
LOOK AT ACTUALLY ISSUES OF

00:17:41.393 --> 00:17:44.963
POVERTY AND WORK FORCE AND

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:45.597
WHETHER IT WAS CREATED SOCIAL

00:17:45.664 --> 00:17:47.332
MOBILITY. AND IN HIS DATA

00:17:47.399 --> 00:17:49.301
ANALYSIS HE DISCOVERED

00:17:49.368 --> 00:17:51.036
SOMETHING THAT HE HADN'T

00:17:51.103 --> 00:17:53.105
INTENDED TO DISCOVER AND THAT

00:17:53.172 --> 00:17:55.174
WAS THAT WHEN STUDENTS ARE

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.309
TAUGHT BY FACULTY OF COLOR. THE

00:17:57.376 --> 00:18:01.079
RACIAL EQUITY GAP- WAS

00:18:01.146 --> 00:18:01.680
PARTICULARLY STUDENT SUCCESS A

00:18:01.747 --> 00:18:06.852
DATA CLOSES ANY CLOSES FROM

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:09.455
NINETEEN TO FIFTY ONE PERCENT-

00:18:09.521 --> 00:18:10.122
AND THAT IS NOT NEW NEWS TO US

00:18:10.189 --> 00:18:13.192
BUT WHAT IS EXTRAORDINARY IS

00:18:13.258 --> 00:18:15.127
HOW MUCH- THE DATA WAS VERY.

00:18:15.194 --> 00:18:17.563
SPECIFIC AND VERY FOCUSED AND

00:18:17.629 --> 00:18:18.931
PARTICULARLY FOR CALIFORNIA

00:18:18.997 --> 00:18:21.300
COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOR MANY

00:18:21.366 --> 00:18:23.435
COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE STATE

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:29.341
IF WE ARE ABLE. ACTUALLY IS A

00:18:29.408 --> 00:18:31.543
CLOSURE FOR A GOOD NUMBER OF

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.111
OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN TERMS

00:18:33.178 --> 00:18:35.247
OF EQUITY THAT'S WHY THIS FOCUS

00:18:35.314 --> 00:18:37.316
IS SO CRITICAL- SO THE

00:18:37.382 --> 00:18:39.318
RESEARCHER ASK QUESTIONS LIKE

00:18:39.384 --> 00:18:41.453
DO UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITY

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.155
STUDENTS PERFORM BETTER IN

00:18:43.222 --> 00:18:44.857
KHÔNG CLASSES TAUGHT BY

00:18:44.923 --> 00:18:47.092
MINORITY INSTRUCTORS. DO

00:18:47.159 --> 00:18:47.726
AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS DO

00:18:47.793 --> 00:18:49.261
BETTER IN CLASSES TAUGHT BY

00:18:49.328 --> 00:18:51.430
AFRICAN AMERICAN INSTRUCTORS SO

00:18:51.497 --> 00:18:54.867
HE WAS ALSO EVEN TAKING A LOOK

00:18:54.933 --> 00:18:56.835
AT THE RACE TO RACE DYNAMIC- DO

00:18:56.902 --> 00:18:59.371
LATINO STUDENTS TO BETTER IN

00:18:59.438 --> 00:19:01.139
COURSES TAUGHT BY LATINO

00:19:01.206 --> 00:19:03.075
INSTRUCTORS AND HOW MUCH. DOES

00:19:03.141 --> 00:19:05.244
THIS REPRESENT IN TERMS OF

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.979
DOING BETTER AND SO IN THE-

00:19:07.045 --> 00:19:09.214
PRESENTATION YOU'LL SEE SOME

00:19:09.281 --> 00:19:11.149
REALLY QUICK SNAPSHOTS OF HOW

00:19:11.216 --> 00:19:15.187
HE SAW JUST PEER DATA. PEER

00:19:15.254 --> 00:19:16.955
DATA ANALYSIS THAT HE SAW GAPS

00:19:17.022 --> 00:19:18.957
CLOSING AND THIS IS HIS

00:19:19.024 --> 00:19:21.059
CONCLUSION STRONG POSITIVE REAL

00:19:21.126 --> 00:19:23.295
BUS MINORITY INTERACTION

00:19:23.362 --> 00:19:25.063
EFFECTS FOR ALL OUTCOMES EXAM.

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:29.201
INCLUDING LONG TERM OUTCOMES

00:19:29.268 --> 00:19:30.969
WHAT HE'S ALSO NOTICED THAT

00:19:31.036 --> 00:19:33.205
STUDENTS WHO ARE TAUGHT. BY A

00:19:33.272 --> 00:19:35.274
CHEMISTRY FACULTY OF COLOR ARE

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.175
MORE LIKELY TO EVEN MAJOR IN

00:19:37.242 --> 00:19:41.079
CHEMISTRY. AND SOLD THAT ALSO

00:19:41.146 --> 00:19:43.248
IS QUITE EXTRAORDINARY- HE SAW

00:19:43.315 --> 00:19:46.985
PARTICULARLY STRONG RACE OF

00:19:47.052 --> 00:19:48.887
RACE OWN OWN RACE INTERACTIONS

00:19:48.954 --> 00:19:50.989
AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS

00:19:51.056 --> 00:19:53.058
HAVING THE HIGHEST- OF

00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:55.093
PERFORMANCE WHEN TAUGHT BY AN

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:55.627
AFRICAN AMERICAN. FACULTY

00:19:55.694 --> 00:19:59.565
ALTHOUGH EVEN LATINO STUDENTS

00:19:59.631 --> 00:20:00.198
WERE PERFORMING VERY WELL IT

00:20:00.265 --> 00:20:01.066
TAUGHT BY AN AFRICAN AMERICAN

00:20:01.133 --> 00:20:03.535
FACULTY AND SO THE INTERACTION

00:20:03.602 --> 00:20:04.970
OF RACE IS ACTUALLY QUITE

00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:07.339
EXTRANET NOW. I'M NOT SURPRISED

00:20:07.406 --> 00:20:09.274
BY THIS DATA BECAUSE IF YOU

00:20:09.341 --> 00:20:09.908
TAKE A LOOK AT THE KEY TWELVE

00:20:09.975 --> 00:20:11.543
DATA IT ALSO SHOWS THAT IN FACT

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:13.545
WHEN A FACULTY OF COLOR

00:20:13.612 --> 00:20:15.180
PARTICULARLY AFRICAN AMERICAN

00:20:15.247 --> 00:20:17.416
FACULTY TEACHES- DE ELLAS

00:20:17.482 --> 00:20:20.886
STUDENT SUCCESS RATE INCREASES

00:20:20.953 --> 00:20:21.453
FOR ALL STUDENTS INCLUDING.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.055
CAUCASIAN STUDENTS SO QUITE

00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:25.190
EXTRAORDINARY AND WHAT HE SAW

00:20:25.257 --> 00:20:31.430
WAS. THERE WAS THIS ROLE MODEL

00:20:31.496 --> 00:20:37.436
AFFECT IT. NOT LIKE THE FACULTY

00:20:37.502 --> 00:20:39.471
OF COLLEGE ANYTHING DIFFERENT.

00:20:39.538 --> 00:20:39.972
THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING

00:20:40.038 --> 00:20:41.540
DIFFERENT BUT IT'S HOW THE

00:20:41.607 --> 00:20:42.140
STUDENTS SOLVE THE FACULTY AND

00:20:42.207 --> 00:20:43.408
THE ROLE MODEL AFFECT THAT CAME

00:20:43.475 --> 00:20:45.477
WITH THAT- THE FULL ARTICLE IS

00:20:45.544 --> 00:20:47.012
ALSO IN THE PRESENTATION. AND

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:47.646
THEN IT REALLY QUICKLY THERE IS

00:20:47.713 --> 00:20:49.281
NO DOUBT DIVERSEY ALSO HELPS

00:20:49.348 --> 00:20:51.316
IMPROVE THE TEAM SO THE

00:20:51.383 --> 00:20:53.085
FUNCTION OF THE COLLEGE AS A

00:20:53.151 --> 00:20:53.719
COLLEGE PRESIDENT TEAM WORK AS

00:20:53.785 --> 00:20:55.320
THEY SAY MAKES THE DREAM WORK

00:20:55.387 --> 00:20:57.289
RIGHT BUT TEAM WORK IS ONLY

00:20:57.356 --> 00:20:57.756
POSSIBLE IN TERMS OF

00:20:57.823 --> 00:21:00.993
INNOVATION. NEW PERSPECTIVES

00:21:01.059 --> 00:21:03.295
FRESHNESS OF IT IDEAS BEING

00:21:03.362 --> 00:21:05.297
ABLE TO SAY THINGS THAT MAYBE

00:21:05.364 --> 00:21:09.101
OTHERS WOULD SAY. THAT IS FROM

00:21:09.167 --> 00:21:11.336
DIVERT. ALL TYPES OF DIVERSITY

00:21:11.403 --> 00:21:13.338
BUT ALSO RACIAL DIVERSITY AND

00:21:13.405 --> 00:21:13.839
SO THERE IS A STUDY BY

00:21:13.905 --> 00:21:15.474
MACKENZIE THAT SHOWS EVEN

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.376
RACIAL AND GENDER DIVERSE THE

00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:19.378
HELP COMPANIES WITH THEIR

00:21:19.444 --> 00:21:25.417
BOTTOM LINE- AND SO THAT IS

00:21:25.484 --> 00:21:30.956
WORTH WORTH TAKING A LOOK AT TO.

00:21:31.023 --> 00:21:31.590
L. SO THEN IF WE ALL KNOW THAT

00:21:31.657 --> 00:21:33.625
THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO

00:21:33.692 --> 00:21:34.192
FOR OUR STUDENTS THEN THE

00:21:34.259 --> 00:21:35.193
QUESTION IS HOW DO WE DO IT X.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:35.794
SPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF LEGAL.

00:21:35.861 --> 00:21:37.362
PARAMETERS AND CONSTRUCTIONS

00:21:37.429 --> 00:21:39.197
THAT WE HAVE AND WE KNOW THAT

00:21:39.264 --> 00:21:41.299
WHAT PROP TWO WILL NINE SAYS IN

00:21:41.366 --> 00:21:43.301
TERMS OF A PROHIBITION AGAINST

00:21:43.368 --> 00:21:43.902
PREFERENCE BASED ON RACE AND

00:21:43.969 --> 00:21:47.205
GENDER. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT

00:21:47.272 --> 00:21:47.839
IN THIS WORK IT'S TWO SIDES OF

00:21:47.906 --> 00:21:51.109
THE KIDS SAME POINT I OFTEN

00:21:51.176 --> 00:21:51.710
DESCRIBE IT TWO SIDES OF THE

00:21:51.777 --> 00:21:54.913
SAME COIN. SO ONE SIDE

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:55.347
PROHIBITS YOU FROM

00:21:55.414 --> 00:21:57.149
DISCRIMINATION EVEN BEFORE PROP

00:21:57.215 --> 00:22:00.052
TILL NINE THERE WAS ALREADY NON

00:22:00.118 --> 00:22:03.321
DISCRIMINATION LAWS. RIGHT BUT

00:22:03.388 --> 00:22:03.922
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN IS

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:06.958
EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY

00:22:07.025 --> 00:22:09.194
ENSURING THAT EVERYONE HAS AN

00:22:09.261 --> 00:22:11.196
EQUAL FAIR SHAKE NO MATTER WHAT

00:22:11.263 --> 00:22:13.298
THEIR RACE NO MATTER WHAT THEIR

00:22:13.365 --> 00:22:15.300
GENDER. HE IN THE HIRING

00:22:15.367 --> 00:22:18.970
EMPLOYMENT PROCESS AND SO- IN

00:22:19.037 --> 00:22:20.906
HERE IT ALSO SPEAKS TO A LITTLE

00:22:20.972 --> 00:22:21.506
BIT OF THE LEGISLATIVE MANDATE

00:22:21.573 --> 00:22:25.143
AROUND A DIVERSE WORKFORCE- IT

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:27.279
ALSO TALKS ABOUT TITLE FIVE.

00:22:27.345 --> 00:22:29.114
AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF UP IN

00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:31.349
THE REGULATIONS AROUND HAVING A

00:22:31.416 --> 00:22:35.087
DIVERSE WORKFORCE SO THERE IS

00:22:35.153 --> 00:22:37.289
NO DOUBT THAT OUR OUR LAWS

00:22:37.355 --> 00:22:38.924
HAVE. HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REFLECT

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:41.259
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN THAT

00:22:41.326 --> 00:22:43.028
IS THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT

00:22:43.095 --> 00:22:43.662
OPPORTUNITY AND THE REQUIREMENT

00:22:43.729 --> 00:22:46.965
FOR TRAINING. AND SPECIFICALLY

00:22:47.032 --> 00:22:49.101
OUR REGULATIONS EVEN REQUIRE

00:22:49.167 --> 00:22:49.735
TRAININGS AROUND IN PLACE HI

00:22:49.801 --> 00:22:53.171
YES- AND THAT IS SOMETHING I

00:22:53.238 --> 00:22:53.805
THINK IS ALSO ANOTHER STRATEGY

00:22:53.872 --> 00:22:55.507
THAT FOLKS NEED TO FOCUS ON-

00:22:55.574 --> 00:22:58.944
THE NOTION OF UNCONSCIOUS BIAS.

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:01.079
AND MORE TO COME ON THAT.

00:23:01.146 --> 00:23:01.646
DURING MY TIME AT THE STATE

00:23:01.713 --> 00:23:03.448
CHAMBERS OFFICE I DID WRITE A

00:23:03.515 --> 00:23:06.918
LEGAL OPINION. AROUND EQUAL

00:23:06.985 --> 00:23:09.054
EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND

00:23:09.121 --> 00:23:11.022
WHAT IF BUT NOT WHAT YOU CAN'T

00:23:11.089 --> 00:23:13.024
DO BUT WHAT YOU CAN DO. TO

00:23:13.091 --> 00:23:15.360
INSURE RACIAL DIVERSITY AND SO

00:23:15.427 --> 00:23:17.195
FOLKS CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THAT

00:23:17.262 --> 00:23:25.203
MEMEL BUT AT THE. END OF THE

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:30.976
MUMBLE PARTICULARLY POINTS OUT.

00:23:31.042 --> 00:23:32.944
AN ANALYTICAL PATHWAY. AND I

00:23:33.011 --> 00:23:33.512
ASKED THE STATE LEGISLATURE

00:23:33.578 --> 00:23:35.413
ALONG WITH COLLEAGUES TO TAKE A

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.047
LOOK AT THAT ANALYTICAL PATHWAY

00:23:36.114 --> 00:23:36.581
BECAUSE IT TALKS ABOUT FOR

00:23:36.648 --> 00:23:37.249
INSTANCE THE NOTION OF ADVERSE

00:23:37.315 --> 00:23:39.384
IMPACT. IT TALKS ABOUT WHAT WE

00:23:39.451 --> 00:23:40.018
CALL THE FOUR FIFTHS RULE WHICH

00:23:40.085 --> 00:23:41.186
IS THE 8020% RULE IT'S AN

00:23:41.253 --> 00:23:43.255
ANALYTICAL WAY TO KNOW WHETHER

00:23:43.321 --> 00:23:45.157
THERE ARE. POSSIBLE RACIAL

00:23:45.223 --> 00:23:47.459
IMPACTS OF WHAT IS HAPPENING

00:23:47.526 --> 00:23:49.327
AROUND THE EMPLOYMENT OF

00:23:49.394 --> 00:23:51.263
PROCESS SO I THINK IT'S WORTH A

00:23:51.329 --> 00:23:53.198
SPECIALLY AS WE GET MORE

00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:55.433
SOPHISTICATED. IN THE WORK OF

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.135
FACULTY DIVERSITY HIRING OF YOU

00:23:57.202 --> 00:23:59.337
KNOW I THINK OUR SYSTEM IN

00:23:59.404 --> 00:24:00.872
GENERAL IS- IS VERY COMMITTED A

00:24:00.939 --> 00:24:03.141
TO THE NOTION OF FACULTY

00:24:03.208 --> 00:24:05.243
DIVERSITY I THINK OUR SYSTEM IN

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:06.845
GENERAL IS COMMITTED FROM A

00:24:06.912 --> 00:24:07.379
FINANCIAL STANDPOINT. OF

00:24:07.445 --> 00:24:09.347
FACULTY DIVERSITY BUT WE DO

00:24:09.414 --> 00:24:10.949
NEED TO GET SOPHISTICATED

00:24:11.016 --> 00:24:13.385
AROUND THE WORK BECAUSE WE ARE

00:24:13.451 --> 00:24:15.420
GOING AGAINST POSSIBLE IMPLICIT

00:24:15.487 --> 00:24:19.257
BIAS- AND THE LIKE- AND SO I

00:24:19.324 --> 00:24:22.928
THINK IT'S REALLY CRITICAL TO

00:24:22.994 --> 00:24:23.461
TAKE A LOOK AT IT FROM AN

00:24:23.528 --> 00:24:27.065
ANALYTICAL STANDPOINT. AND

00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:27.632
LASTLY JUST A QUICK COLLEGE

00:24:27.699 --> 00:24:29.501
PRESIDENT PERSON. AND TO SOME

00:24:29.568 --> 00:24:33.405
EXTENT- A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE-

00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:34.005
THERE IS THIS NOTION CALLED A

00:24:34.072 --> 00:24:34.506
TEST CALL THE IMPLICIT

00:24:34.573 --> 00:24:37.042
ASSOCIATION TESTS. I THINK WE

00:24:37.108 --> 00:24:39.377
REALLY TO GET SOPHISTIC SAID

00:24:39.444 --> 00:24:40.846
IT'S AN ABILITY TO TEST

00:24:40.912 --> 00:24:43.348
ANONYMOUSLY WHETHER ONE HAS

00:24:43.415 --> 00:24:45.417
UNCONSCIOUS BIAS WITH REGARDS

00:24:45.483 --> 00:24:49.120
TO RACE. AND THIS SHOULD BE

00:24:49.187 --> 00:24:51.189
REALLY TAUGHT BECAUSE IF IT'S

00:24:51.256 --> 00:24:52.958
UNCONSCIOUS EVEN IF YOU THINK

00:24:53.024 --> 00:24:55.260
YOU ARE YES I'M AWARE I'M AND

00:24:55.327 --> 00:24:57.162
CON I HAVE A CONSCIOUS BIAS.

00:24:57.229 --> 00:24:59.331
YES OUR SOCIETY IS WORKING A

00:24:59.397 --> 00:25:01.032
RAN AGAINST SYSTEM LIST OF

00:25:01.099 --> 00:25:03.168
OPPRESSION AND PARTICULARLY

00:25:03.235 --> 00:25:03.768
AROUND RACISM. I'LL BUT WHAT

00:25:03.835 --> 00:25:07.172
CAN I DO. THE NOTION OF

00:25:07.239 --> 00:25:09.140
IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING IS THAT

00:25:09.207 --> 00:25:09.741
KNOWING IS NOT ENOUGH JUST

00:25:09.808 --> 00:25:11.643
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT IS NOT

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:13.411
ENOUGH YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO

00:25:13.478 --> 00:25:15.513
TAKE STEPS TO LOWER YOUR

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.884
INDIVIDUAL BIAS. AND THEY'RE

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.119
ACTUALLY ALSO STRATEGIES ON HOW

00:25:21.186 --> 00:25:23.488
TO LOWERED THAT BIAS ON A DAILY

00:25:23.555 --> 00:25:27.359
BASIS YOU ALMOST HAVE TO WORK-

00:25:27.425 --> 00:25:31.162
AGAINST YOUR. UNCONSCIOUS BIAS

00:25:31.229 --> 00:25:37.168
TO BE ABLE TO LOWER THAT BIAS.

00:25:37.235 --> 00:25:39.137
THE LONGITUDINAL DATA TO

00:25:39.204 --> 00:25:39.704
MENTION TO YOU I THINK IT'S

00:25:39.771 --> 00:25:41.239
CRITICAL TO GET SOPHISTICATED

00:25:41.306 --> 00:25:41.873
AROUND THIS WORK AND THE NOTION

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.241
THAT THE EMPLOYMENT HIRING AND

00:25:43.308 --> 00:25:45.010
THE STUDENT EQUITY PLAN SHOULD

00:25:45.076 --> 00:25:45.543
ACTUALLY BE INTEGRATED WE

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:47.212
SHOULD SEAT BECAUSE- IN ORDER

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:49.281
TO CLOSE TO STUDENT EQUITY GAP

00:25:49.347 --> 00:25:51.283
WE NEED FACULTY DIVERSITY. AND

00:25:51.349 --> 00:25:53.418
SO THEREFORE FAULTY DIVERSITY

00:25:53.485 --> 00:25:55.387
IS A STRATEGY IN STUDENT EQUITY

00:25:55.453 --> 00:25:57.355
WORK AND THEREFORE IT NEEDS TO

00:25:57.422 --> 00:25:59.190
BE INTEGRATED IN THAT WAY IT

00:25:59.257 --> 00:26:01.192
SHOULD BE TWO HOUSES IT

00:26:01.259 --> 00:26:03.461
SHOULDN'T BE TOO PLANTS- THE

00:26:03.528 --> 00:26:05.263
OTHER IS ALSO I SUBMIT TO YOU

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.465
WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER PART

00:26:07.532 --> 00:26:09.367
TIME FACULTY. THERE'S BEEN A

00:26:09.434 --> 00:26:11.269
LOT OF FOCUS ON TIME FACULTY

00:26:11.336 --> 00:26:13.238
HIRING BUT THE PART TIME

00:26:13.305 --> 00:26:15.540
FACULTY HIRING HAS ACTUALLY

00:26:15.607 --> 00:26:17.275
BEEN- UNDER THE RADAR SO TO

00:26:17.342 --> 00:26:19.711
SPEAK AND I THINK THERE NEEDS

00:26:19.778 --> 00:26:20.879
TO BE SOME ATTENTION AROUND

00:26:20.946 --> 00:26:22.881
THAT HIRING A PART TIME FACULTY

00:26:22.948 --> 00:26:26.985
ALSO IN OUR SYSTEM- AND- I KNOW

00:26:27.052 --> 00:26:27.619
OUR SYSTEM IS GOING TO TALK A

00:26:27.686 --> 00:26:29.154
LITTLE BIT ABOUT REQUEST FOR

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.222
FUNDING. I THINK THAT'S REALLY

00:26:31.289 --> 00:26:31.790
CRITICAL AS WE BRING MORE

00:26:31.856 --> 00:26:34.893
PEOPLE ON THE BUS THAT'S WHERE

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.095
THE STRATEGIES OF ALL THIS WORK

00:26:37.162 --> 00:26:39.331
COULD BE VERY IMPACTFUL. AND

00:26:39.397 --> 00:26:41.199
LASTLY I WANTED THANK YOU ONE

00:26:41.266 --> 00:26:43.268
OF THE TWELVE STRATEGIES TO

00:26:43.335 --> 00:26:47.138
LOWER IMPLICIT BIAS BASED

00:26:47.205 --> 00:26:47.739
RESEARCH IS THAT WE MONITOR.

00:26:47.806 --> 00:26:51.276
IMPLICIT BIAS WHEN YOU PUT

00:26:51.343 --> 00:26:54.913
PEOPLE UNDER A WHAT IS ON FMRI

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:55.513
TO SEE WHETHER THEY'RE BIASED

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.615
GOES UP. IF YOU TELL THEM THAT

00:26:57.682 --> 00:27:01.152
I AM MONITORING YOU FOR

00:27:01.219 --> 00:27:03.388
IMPLICIT BIAS THE PIE IS GOES

00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:05.190
DOWN. AND SO THE WORK THAT

00:27:05.256 --> 00:27:08.927
YOU'RE DOING TO MONITOR. SYSTEM

00:27:08.994 --> 00:27:11.563
Y. EIGHT WIDE THE WORK THAT WE

00:27:11.629 --> 00:27:13.431
DO AS ALLEGE PRESIDENTS TO

00:27:13.498 --> 00:27:17.002
MONITOR COLLEGE WIDE IS

00:27:17.068 --> 00:27:19.437
CRITICAL TO ACTUALLY LOWERING.

00:27:19.504 --> 00:27:21.573
IMPLICIT BIAS ITSELF SO PLEASE

00:27:21.639 --> 00:27:29.147
KEEP FOCUSED ON THAT AND THE.

00:27:29.214 --> 00:27:29.748
MORE THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

A CONVERSATION ABOUT HIGHER

00:27:53.805 --> 00:27:55.073
EDUCATION THAT IT SHOULD. BE

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.042

00:29:27.665 --> 00:29:31.102
DIVERSITY OF OUR STUDENTS- 69%

00:29:31.169 --> 00:29:33.004
OF STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA

00:29:33.071 --> 00:29:33.605
HIGHER EDUCATION OUR STUDENTS

00:29:33.671 --> 00:29:35.673
OF COLOR. THAT NUMBER IS ONLY

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:39.444
GOING TO GROW AS WE HAVE OVER

00:29:39.511 --> 00:29:41.079
76% OF STUDENTS OF COLOR IN K.

00:29:41.146 --> 00:29:43.481
TWELVE SO YOU CAN SEE WHY THIS

00:29:43.548 --> 00:29:45.150
IS SO CRITICAL AND IMPOSE OUR

00:29:45.216 --> 00:29:48.019
REPORT AND OUR RESEARCH AND

00:29:48.086 --> 00:29:49.087
EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE PROBABLY

00:29:49.154 --> 00:29:51.823
SEEN IT BEFORE YOU WILL NOT BE

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:53.024
SURPRISING. ALTHOUGH OUR

00:29:53.091 --> 00:29:53.525
STUDENTS ARE DIVERSE OUR

00:29:53.591 --> 00:29:55.160
FACULTY CERTAINLY ARE NOT

00:29:55.226 --> 00:29:57.162
ALTHOUGH OUR STUDENTS ARE

00:29:57.228 --> 00:29:59.864
DIVERT OUR ACADEMIC SENATE'S

00:29:59.931 --> 00:30:00.532
ARE NOT. ALTHOUGH OUR STUDENTS

00:30:00.598 --> 00:30:01.132
ARE DIVERSE OUR LEADERSHIP IS

00:30:01.199 --> 00:30:05.637
NOT. TODAY I WILL HIGHLIGHT

00:30:05.703 --> 00:30:07.238
SOME OF THESE NUMBERS FOR YOU I

00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:09.374
JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT THE DATA

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.276
COLLECTED WAS TWENTY SIXTEEN

00:30:11.342 --> 00:30:13.278
TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND YOU CAN

00:30:13.344 --> 00:30:15.213
SEE SOME OF THE DATA I REFER TO

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:15.847
AN EXECUTIVE SUMMARIES THAT YOU

00:30:15.914 --> 00:30:19.150
WERE PROVIDED EARLIER. BUT I

00:30:19.217 --> 00:30:21.186
ALSO WANT TO START FROM A

00:30:21.252 --> 00:30:23.288
REALLY PERSONAL PLACE AS THE

00:30:23.354 --> 00:30:25.390
FIRST IN MY FAMILY TO GO TO

00:30:25.456 --> 00:30:27.458
COLLEGE AS A FIRST AND STUDENT

00:30:27.525 --> 00:30:31.062
WHEN I ARRIVED AT MY CAMPUS

00:30:31.129 --> 00:30:33.498
PITZER COLLEGE NOT TOO FAR FROM

00:30:33.565 --> 00:30:34.966
HEARING. ON'T NOT THAT FAR FROM

00:30:35.033 --> 00:30:37.101
THE DIVERSE LOS ANGELES I GREW

00:30:37.168 --> 00:30:39.304
UP IN NOT THAT FAR FROM THE

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:40.872
DIVERSE HIGH SCHOOL I ATTENDED-

00:30:40.939 --> 00:30:43.107
BUT IT WAS PRETTY STRIKING TO

00:30:43.174 --> 00:30:45.410
BE ON A CAMPUS WHERE I WAS ONE

00:30:45.476 --> 00:30:47.478
OF VERY FEW- STUDENTS OF COLOR.

00:30:47.545 --> 00:30:50.915
AND AS A FIRST GEN STUDENT IT

00:30:50.982 --> 00:30:53.017
WAS CRITICAL FOR ME TO BE ABLE

00:30:53.084 --> 00:30:55.286
TO SEE- MYSELF AS BELONGING

00:30:55.353 --> 00:30:57.121
THERE AND I THINK THIS IS

00:30:57.188 --> 00:30:59.057
REALLY CRITICAL IN THE RESEARCH

00:30:59.123 --> 00:30:59.591
THAT YOU FIND ABOUT FIRST

00:30:59.657 --> 00:31:03.027
GENERATION STUDENTS- A SENSE OF

00:31:03.094 --> 00:31:03.695
BELONGING WILL MAKE IT OR BREAK

00:31:03.761 --> 00:31:05.863
IT FOR STUDENT IN TERMS OF

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:07.699
WHETHER THEY SUCCEED OR NOT. SO

00:31:07.765 --> 00:31:09.667
WHETHER THEY HAVE ROLE MODELS

00:31:09.734 --> 00:31:11.035
PEOPLE INVESTED IN THEM- AND

00:31:11.102 --> 00:31:13.538
EVEN JUST PEOPLE THEY CAN LOOK

00:31:13.605 --> 00:31:14.172
AT WHEN THEY SHOW UP IN CLASSES

00:31:14.239 --> 00:31:15.240
THAT. MAY SHARE THEIR SAME

00:31:15.306 --> 00:31:17.275
EXPERIENCE WE WANT TO SEE

00:31:17.342 --> 00:31:19.410
OURSELVES IN THE FOLKS IN FRONT

00:31:19.477 --> 00:31:23.114
OF US AND WHEN WE SEE OURSELVES

00:31:23.181 --> 00:31:24.983
WE SEE THAT THE INSTITUTION

00:31:25.049 --> 00:31:27.118
VALUES ARE EXPERIENCE BECAUSE

00:31:27.185 --> 00:31:29.287
IT HIRES PEOPLE THAT COME FROM

00:31:29.354 --> 00:31:31.122
OUR EXPERIENCE- WE KNOW THAT WE

00:31:31.189 --> 00:31:33.091
ARE VALUED BECAUSE WE ARE

00:31:33.157 --> 00:31:35.360
REPRESENTED- ALL HUMAN

00:31:35.426 --> 00:31:37.962
CONNECTION STARTS WITH THE IDEA

00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:39.163
OF FINDING SOMETHING IN COMMON.

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:43.534
AND. LIVING IN A DIVERSE STATE

00:31:43.601 --> 00:31:49.841
LIKE CALIFORNIA. THE FIND IN

00:31:49.907 --> 00:31:51.309
COMMON TO A VARIETY OF THINGS

00:31:51.376 --> 00:31:51.943
BUT ALL STUDENTS BENEFIT FROM

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:52.977
HAVING DIVERSE FACULTY SO I

00:31:53.044 --> 00:31:53.645
ALSO WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT

00:31:53.711 --> 00:31:55.546
WHILE IT'S POWERFUL FOR FIRST

00:31:55.613 --> 00:31:57.348
CHEN. STUDENTS OF COLOR TO SEE

00:31:57.415 --> 00:31:58.016
FACULTY OF COLOR THAT LOOK LIKE

00:31:58.082 --> 00:31:59.317
THEM THAT REFLECT THEIR

00:31:59.384 --> 00:31:59.951
EXPERIENCE THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR

00:32:00.018 --> 00:32:01.252
WHITE STUDENTS TO HAVE WHITE

00:32:01.319 --> 00:32:03.021
STUDENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE

00:32:03.087 --> 00:32:05.089
LET NEXT FACULTY. AFRICAN

00:32:05.156 --> 00:32:07.225
AMERICAN FACULTY ASIAN AMERICAN

00:32:07.292 --> 00:32:09.193
FACULTY SO WANT TO BE CLEAR

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.062
THAT THIS IS ABOUT WHAT'S GOOD

00:32:11.129 --> 00:32:13.298
FOR A DIVERSE CALIFORNIA AND A

00:32:13.364 --> 00:32:13.931
GLOBAL ECONOMY THAT WE ALL LIVE

00:32:13.998 --> 00:32:19.537
IN. SO GIVING GIVEN THE GROWING

00:32:19.604 --> 00:32:20.204
DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE YOU KNOW

00:32:20.271 --> 00:32:21.239
WE THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY-

00:32:21.306 --> 00:32:23.374
IMPORTANT TO DO THIS RESEARCH

00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:25.109
AND ANALYSIS. OFTENTIMES I

00:32:25.176 --> 00:32:27.045
THINK YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH

00:32:27.111 --> 00:32:27.645
OUR STATE OF HIGHER EDUCATION

00:32:27.712 --> 00:32:29.547
REPORTS WHICH LOOK AT STUDENTS

00:32:29.614 --> 00:32:31.215
HOW MANY STUDENTS OF COLOR ARE

00:32:31.282 --> 00:32:33.151
THERE THAT ARE PREPARED FOR

00:32:33.217 --> 00:32:35.753
COLLEGE HOW MANY GO TO COLLEGE

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:36.354
WE HAVE A STATE OF HIGHER ED

00:32:36.421 --> 00:32:37.889
REPORT FOR LOT NEXT. STATE OF

00:32:37.955 --> 00:32:39.290
HIGHER ED REPORT FOR BLACK

00:32:39.357 --> 00:32:41.559
STUDENTS. HAD REPORT FOR ASIAN

00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:45.029
AMERICAN. AND HOPEFULLY IN THE

00:32:45.096 --> 00:32:45.663
COMING YEAR YOU'LL SEE A STATE

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:46.331
OF HIGHER ED REPORT FOR NATIVE

00:32:46.397 --> 00:32:47.865
AMERICAN STUDENTS WE DO THOSE

00:32:47.932 --> 00:32:51.169
REPORTS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT

00:32:51.235 --> 00:32:51.803
INSTITUTION SHOULD CARE ABOUT

00:32:51.869 --> 00:32:53.671
HOW THEY BETTER PREPARE. AND

00:32:53.738 --> 00:32:55.273
SUPPORT STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.342
BACKGROUND. AND ARE INTENTIONAL

00:32:57.408 --> 00:32:59.377
IN THAT WAY AS WE DID THOSE

00:32:59.444 --> 00:33:01.145
REPORTS WE REALIZE THAT IT WAS

00:33:01.212 --> 00:33:03.781
IMPORTANT TO PUT AMERICA ON

00:33:03.848 --> 00:33:05.083
PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION AS

00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:07.385
WELL. TO SEE HOW IS NOT JUST

00:33:07.452 --> 00:33:10.088
THE DIVERSITY OF THE INCOMING

00:33:10.154 --> 00:33:10.888
STUDENT BODY AND WHAT THEIR

00:33:10.955 --> 00:33:13.191
SUCCESS RATES ARE BUT WHAT IS

00:33:13.257 --> 00:33:15.159
THE DIVERSITY IN REPRESENTATION

00:33:15.226 --> 00:33:17.328
EXIST IN OUR PUBLIC HIGHER

00:33:17.395 --> 00:33:18.896
EDUCATION SYSTEMS. SO AS I

00:33:18.963 --> 00:33:19.464
SHARED EARLIER IN SPITE OF

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:22.967
REALLY BROAD DIVERSITY WE HAVE

00:33:23.034 --> 00:33:25.103
OVER TWO POINT TWO MILLION

00:33:25.169 --> 00:33:27.839
STUDENTS ENROLLED IN PUBLIC. IN

00:33:27.905 --> 00:33:29.006
OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ALONE

00:33:29.073 --> 00:33:33.378
44% OF STUDENTS ARE LOT NEXT

00:33:33.444 --> 00:33:34.011
TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT. RIGHT 14%

00:33:34.078 --> 00:33:35.313
OR ASIAN AMERICAN NATIVE

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.515
HAWAIIAN OR PACIFIC ISLANDER

00:33:37.582 --> 00:33:39.517
AND 6% ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN.

00:33:39.584 --> 00:33:41.386
YET DESPITE THAT RICH DIVERSITY

00:33:41.452 --> 00:33:43.621
OF OUR STUDENT BODY WE HAVE A

00:33:43.688 --> 00:33:46.023
TRUE LACK OF DIVERSITY IN BOTH

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:51.329
TENURED AND NON. TENURED

00:33:51.396 --> 00:33:51.829
FACULTY POSITIONS AT THE

00:33:51.896 --> 00:33:59.137
COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AS YOU CAN.

00:33:59.203 --> 00:34:01.172
THE HAND OUT THE STE. NO THE

00:34:01.239 --> 00:34:01.706
TENURED FACULTY COMMUNITY

00:34:01.773 --> 00:34:03.107
COLLEGES ARE 61% WHITE. 15%

00:34:03.174 --> 00:34:05.510
MONEX ONLY 10% ASIAN AMERICAN

00:34:05.576 --> 00:34:06.911
NATIVE HAWAIIAN PACIFIC

00:34:06.978 --> 00:34:07.512
ISLANDER 6% AFRICAN AMERICAN.

00:34:07.578 --> 00:34:09.046
THE STORY OF NON TENURED

00:34:09.113 --> 00:34:09.547
FACULTY AT OUR COMMUNITY

00:34:09.614 --> 00:34:11.282
COLLEGES IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENT

00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:15.386
60% WHITE. IT'S A DIFFERENCE OF

00:34:15.453 --> 00:34:17.054
PERCENT FROM TENURED FACULTY

00:34:17.121 --> 00:34:21.092
ARE 13% LOT NEXT 11% ASIAN

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:23.194
AMERICAN NATIVE HAWAIIAN AND 5%

00:34:23.261 --> 00:34:27.064
AFRICAN AMERICAN. I LIKE TO

00:34:27.131 --> 00:34:27.665
SHARE BOTH TENURED AND NON TEN

00:34:27.732 --> 00:34:29.300
BECAUSE- OFTEN YOU WILL HEAR

00:34:29.367 --> 00:34:31.369
THAT THE INCOMING PIPELINE OF

00:34:31.436 --> 00:34:33.638
FACULTY IS MORE DIVERSE THE

00:34:33.704 --> 00:34:36.941
DATA WE ANALYZED DOES NOT.

00:34:37.008 --> 00:34:37.608
PROVE THAT TO BE ACCURATE AND I

00:34:37.675 --> 00:34:41.012
THINK PRESIDENT WHEN- MENTIONED

00:34:41.078 --> 00:34:41.612
THAT IN HER COMMENTS IF THE

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:45.016
PIPELINE IS NON TENURED FACULTY

00:34:45.082 --> 00:34:46.984
AND THAT PIPELINE IS ACTUALLY

00:34:47.051 --> 00:34:49.387
EITHER AS- LACKING IN DIVERSITY

00:34:49.454 --> 00:34:51.222
AS ARE TENURED FACULTY- HOW ARE

00:34:51.289 --> 00:34:54.926
WE GOING TO PRODUCE IN ANY NEAR

00:34:54.992 --> 00:34:58.863
FUTURE- DIVERSE REFLECTIVE.

00:34:58.930 --> 00:34:59.397
REPRESENTATIVE FACULTY FOR

COMMUNITY COLLEGES. RACIAL

00:35:03.367 --> 00:35:03.768
INEQUITIES IN FACULTY

00:35:03.835 --> 00:35:05.169

ACADEMIC SENATE'S FOR CAMPUSES

00:35:09.674 --> 00:35:11.242
AND FOR THE SYSTEM ITSELF THIS

00:35:11.309 --> 00:35:13.110
IS CONCERNING GIVEN THE ROLE

00:35:13.177 --> 00:35:15.246
ACADEMIC SENATE'S PLAY AN

00:35:15.313 --> 00:35:17.181
ESTABLISHING POLICIES WHICH CAN

00:35:17.248 --> 00:35:17.815
DRAMATICALLY IMPACT THE ABILITY

00:35:17.882 --> 00:35:19.283
FOR STUDENTS. ESPECIALLY

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:21.719
STUDENTS OF COLOR TO ACCESS AND

00:35:21.786 --> 00:35:25.356
THRIVE AT COLLEGES. IN YOUR

00:35:25.423 --> 00:35:25.990
PACKET YOU WILL ALSO FIND BRIEF

00:35:26.057 --> 00:35:27.358

00:35:31.496 --> 00:35:33.164
AMONG THOSE CRITICAL LEADERSHIP

BODIES THAT EXERCISE

00:35:33.664 --> 00:35:35.166
SIGNIFICANT DUTIES AND

YOU ON THIS COMMITTEE NOW WE

00:36:10.001 --> 00:36:13.271
STRONGLY OPPOSED TO. IT IS

00:36:13.337 --> 00:36:13.771
IMPORTANT FOR THOSE IN

00:36:13.838 --> 00:36:14.438
POSITIONS TO INFLUENCE ACADEMIC

00:36:14.505 --> 00:36:15.473

THE STUDENTS THE IMPACT. IT

00:36:21.245 --> 00:36:23.414
AGAIN WE SEE A MISMATCH A

00:36:23.481 --> 00:36:24.048
REPRESENTATION BETWEEN WHO SITS

00:36:24.115 --> 00:36:25.383

00:36:35.293 --> 00:36:39.564
PACIFIC ISLANDER AND ONLY 5%

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:45.369
ARE AFRICAN. THE ONE BRIGHT

00:36:45.436 --> 00:36:47.038
NOTE OUR RESEARCH DID FIND WAS

00:36:47.104 --> 00:36:48.973
THAT THERE WAS GREATER GENDER

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:49.507
EQUITY AND REPRESENTATION

00:36:49.574 --> 00:36:51.509
ESPECIALLY A CALIFORNIA

00:36:51.576 --> 00:36:52.043
COMMUNITY COLLEGES BETWEEN

00:36:52.109 --> 00:36:55.413
STUDENTS AND FACULTY. MORE THAN

00:36:55.479 --> 00:36:58.883
HALF OF OUR STUDENTS AT

00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:59.417
COMMUNITY COLLEGE 53% ARE

00:36:59.483 --> 00:37:03.454
FEMALE. AND WOMEN ARE AT OR

00:37:03.521 --> 00:37:05.122
ABOVE REPRESENTATIONAL EQUITY

00:37:05.189 --> 00:37:07.224
IN TEN YEAR TO NON TENURED

00:37:07.291 --> 00:37:09.060
FACULTY POSITIONS AND WITHIN

00:37:09.126 --> 00:37:11.228
THE ACADEMIC SENATE 54% OF

00:37:11.295 --> 00:37:15.166
TENURED FACULTY ARE FEMALE

00:37:15.232 --> 00:37:15.733
FIFTY AND 53% OF NON TENURED

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.403
FACULTY ARE FEMALE. WE OFTEN

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:20.037
HEAR THE PEOPLE APPRECIATE AND

00:37:20.104 --> 00:37:21.606
WANT DIVERSITY HOWEVER AS THIS

00:37:21.672 --> 00:37:23.441
DATA SHOWS AND I THINK AS THE

00:37:23.507 --> 00:37:27.345
CHANCELLOR- OPENED WE OFTEN

00:37:27.411 --> 00:37:27.945
JUST GIVE LIP SERVICE TO THAT

00:37:28.012 --> 00:37:33.184
COMMENT. I'M WE'VE COMPLETELY

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:33.718
TOLERATED THE ABSENCE OF

00:37:33.784 --> 00:37:35.553
DIVERSITY AMONGST OUR FACULTY

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:37.254
AND LEADERSHIP THAT OUR PUBLIC

00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:39.190
INSTITUTIONS CHAIR MEDINA YOU

00:37:39.256 --> 00:37:41.092
HAVE RIGHTLY LAMENTED THESE

00:37:41.158 --> 00:37:41.692
CHALLENGES AND THAT CHANGE IS

00:37:41.759 --> 00:37:45.363
NOT HAPPENING FAST ENOUGH. WE

00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:45.963
HOPE THAT TODAY PROVIDES AN

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:49.033
OPPORTUNITY TO NOT ONLY BRING

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:49.700
FOR THEIR ATTENTION ON THE NEED

00:37:49.767 --> 00:37:51.202
TO URGENTLY MAKE AN ACADEMIC

00:37:51.268 --> 00:37:53.337
SENATE POSITIONS MORE

00:37:53.404 --> 00:37:55.139
INCLUSIVE. BUT ALSO IDENTIFY

00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:57.408
PRACTICAL NEXT STEPS TOWARDS

00:37:57.475 --> 00:37:59.410
THAT END SO WE OFFER SOME

00:37:59.477 --> 00:38:01.312
ACTIONABLE STEPS THAT WE THINK

00:38:01.379 --> 00:38:03.047
YOU CAN HELP MOVE FORWARD.

00:38:03.114 --> 00:38:05.149
FIRST OBVIOUSLY THE STATE NEEDS

00:38:05.216 --> 00:38:07.151
TO COMMIT TO RACIAL AND GENDER

00:38:07.218 --> 00:38:07.718
EQUITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION

00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:09.420
THROUGH ITS OWN POLICY AND

00:38:09.487 --> 00:38:11.055
BUDGETARY ACTIONS. THE STATE

00:38:11.122 --> 00:38:13.557
SHOULD SET SPECIFIC INTRACTABLE

00:38:13.624 --> 00:38:15.192
GOALS FOR IMPROVING FACULTY

00:38:15.259 --> 00:38:15.760
DIVERSITY AMONG OUR PUBLIC

00:38:15.826 --> 00:38:19.096
HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS.

00:38:19.163 --> 00:38:21.065
OTHERWISE WE LACK OF VISION FOR

00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:21.699
HOW WE EXPECT OUR INSTITUTIONS

00:38:21.766 --> 00:38:24.902
TO IMPROVE AND WILL ACCEPT

00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:25.536
INCREMENTAL CHANGE WHICH IS ALL

00:38:25.603 --> 00:38:31.742
WE'VE EVER GOTTEN. WE MUST ALSO

00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:33.377
BE PUBLIC AND TRANSPARENT ABOUT

00:38:33.444 --> 00:38:33.978
THE GOAL OF INCREASED RACIAL

00:38:34.045 --> 00:38:34.578
DIVERSITY AMONG FACULTY WILL

00:38:34.645 --> 00:38:35.246
TESTING RESOURCES FOR THAT

00:38:35.312 --> 00:38:35.780
PURPOSE AS YOU'VE DONE

00:38:35.846 --> 00:38:37.915
RECENTLY. INVESTMENT SHOULD

00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:39.283
COME WITH CLEAR ACCOUNTABILITY

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:43.120
GOALS AND METRICS IN EVALUATING

00:38:43.187 --> 00:38:45.289
EVALUATING VACANCY. RESOURCES

00:38:45.356 --> 00:38:47.124
ALONE ARE UNLIKELY TO YIELD THE

00:38:47.191 --> 00:38:49.160
DESIRED OUTCOMES WE WANT. WE

00:38:49.226 --> 00:38:51.529
NEED BETTER DATA AND

00:38:51.595 --> 00:38:53.264
TRANSPARENCY ON FACULTY AND

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:55.066
LEADERSHIP REPRESENTATION BY

00:38:55.132 --> 00:38:57.201
RACE BY ETHNICITY AND BY GENDER

00:38:57.268 --> 00:38:59.203
MUST BE STRENGTHENED AND

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:02.006
STREAMLINED AS WE GET THIS DATA

00:39:02.073 --> 00:39:05.009
SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY MONITOR

00:39:05.076 --> 00:39:05.443
WHICH WAS ONE OF THE

00:39:05.509 --> 00:39:06.043
RECOMMENDATIONS PRESIDENT WHEN

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:09.346
ALSO SHE- THE STATE. SHOULD

00:39:09.413 --> 00:39:09.980
WORK TOGETHER WITH THE EXPERTS

00:39:10.047 --> 00:39:11.315
TO DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK FOR ALL

00:39:11.382 --> 00:39:11.749
PUBLIC COLLEGES AND

00:39:11.816 --> 00:39:14.952
UNIVERSITIES TO REPORT ON THE

00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:15.486
RACIAL ETHNIC AND GENDER

00:39:15.553 --> 00:39:17.388
REPRESENTATION OF FACULTY BOTH

00:39:17.455 --> 00:39:19.356
TENURED AND NON TENURED. THEY

00:39:19.423 --> 00:39:21.358
ALREADY HAVE TO REPORT THAT TO

00:39:21.425 --> 00:39:23.160
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHY ARE

00:39:23.227 --> 00:39:24.895
WE COLLECTING IT FOR OUR STATE

00:39:24.962 --> 00:39:27.064
GOVERNMENT WE SHOULD ALSO

00:39:27.131 --> 00:39:28.899
REQUIRE THAT ACADEMIC SENATE'S

00:39:28.966 --> 00:39:30.901
IN SENIOR LEADERSHIP REPORT

00:39:30.968 --> 00:39:31.402
THIS DATA. THEY ARE NOT

00:39:31.469 --> 00:39:35.473
REQUIRED TO REPORT IT. HOW ELSE

00:39:35.539 --> 00:39:37.108
CAN YOU MEASURE PROGRESS. AT A

00:39:37.174 --> 00:39:39.310
CAMPUS LEVEL CAMPUSES SHOULD BE

00:39:39.376 --> 00:39:41.345
REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH CAMPUS

00:39:41.412 --> 00:39:43.114
GOALS WITH SPECIFIC PLANS. AND

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.449
MILESTONES FOR CLOSING RACIAL

00:39:45.516 --> 00:39:47.251
DIVERSITY GAPS AN INCREASING

00:39:47.318 --> 00:39:49.420
REPRESENTATION AMONG FACULTY

00:39:49.487 --> 00:39:53.057
AND CAMPUS LEADERSHIP. WE ALSO

00:39:53.124 --> 00:39:53.724
KNOW THAT RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

00:39:53.791 --> 00:39:55.659
LIKE THAT OF U. S. C. CENTER

00:39:55.726 --> 00:39:57.228
FOR URBAN EDUCATION THE CAMPUS

00:39:57.294 --> 00:39:59.497
IS ALSO NEED TO COMPLETELY

00:39:59.563 --> 00:40:01.031
RESTRUCTURE THEIR HIRING

00:40:01.098 --> 00:40:03.067
PROCESS AND FUNDAMENTALLY

00:40:03.134 --> 00:40:03.601
CHANGE THE ROLE OF HUMAN

00:40:03.667 --> 00:40:07.104
RESOURCES FROM THE CONTENT OF A

00:40:07.171 --> 00:40:09.140
POSITION ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE

00:40:09.206 --> 00:40:09.774
OUTRAGE THEY CONDUCT ON THOSE

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.709
POSITION ANNOUNCEMENTS. TO

00:40:11.776 --> 00:40:13.144
CHANGING THE INTERVIEW

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:15.312
QUESTIONS TO REALLY PROBING FOR

00:40:15.379 --> 00:40:17.148
EQUITY MINDED COMPETENCIES

00:40:17.214 --> 00:40:19.283
BECAUSE NOT ONLY DO WE WANT

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:21.252
DIVERSE PROFESSIONALS AT OUR

00:40:21.318 --> 00:40:22.953
CAMPUSES WE WANT EQUITY MINDED

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:25.489
PROFESSIONALS AT OUR CAMPUSES.

00:40:25.556 --> 00:40:27.258
WE SHOULD BE ASKING FOR

00:40:27.324 --> 00:40:29.527
TEACHING DEMONSTRATIONS THAT

00:40:29.593 --> 00:40:31.162
SPECIFICALLY DEMONSTRATE

00:40:31.228 --> 00:40:31.662
KNOWLEDGE OF CULTURALLY

00:40:31.729 --> 00:40:34.965
RESPONSIVE PEDAGOGY. THERE'S A

00:40:35.032 --> 00:40:37.434
LOT MORE THAT USC AND DOCTOR

00:40:37.501 --> 00:40:39.236
STYLE OF AND SIMONE AND HER HER

00:40:39.303 --> 00:40:41.238
GROUP CAN REALLY PROVIDE ON

00:40:41.305 --> 00:40:44.942
THAT NOTE I ALSO JUST WANT TO-

00:40:45.009 --> 00:40:47.144
TO SAY THAT SOMETIMES THE LEGAL

00:40:47.211 --> 00:40:49.480
QUESTIONS THAT ARE RAISED

00:40:49.547 --> 00:40:51.048
AROUND THE LIMITATIONS OF PROP

00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:55.085
TWO OH NINE- ARE USED AS AN

00:40:55.152 --> 00:40:57.421
EXCUSE FOR NOT BEING MORE

00:40:57.488 --> 00:40:59.056
DIVERSE ON CAMPUS. AND I WOULD

00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:01.458
LIKE US TO BE BRAVE AND BOLD TO

00:41:01.525 --> 00:41:03.194
FLIP THE QUESTION I DON'T

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.362
UNDERSTAND HOW SOME CAMPUSES

00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:07.264
CAN HAVE TWENTY OPEN POSITIONS

00:41:07.331 --> 00:41:09.967
FILL ALL TWENTY POSITIONS WITH

00:41:10.034 --> 00:41:11.302
ONLY WHITE FACULTY AND NOT BE

00:41:11.368 --> 00:41:15.139
THREATENED WITH THE CONCERN.

00:41:15.206 --> 00:41:15.573
THAT MAYBE THEY ARE

00:41:15.639 --> 00:41:17.274
DISCRIMINATING AGAINST FACULTY

00:41:17.341 --> 00:41:19.176
OF COLOR SO INSTEAD OF ALWAYS

00:41:19.243 --> 00:41:21.345
FEELING LIKE WE HAVE TO DEFEND

00:41:21.412 --> 00:41:25.082
DIVERSITY I THINK CAMPUSES AND

00:41:25.149 --> 00:41:28.986
CAMPUS LEADERS SHOULD BE IN A

00:41:29.053 --> 00:41:29.553
POSITION TO DEFEND TO THEIR

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:39.530
LACK OF DIVERSITY. THE WORK IS

00:41:39.597 --> 00:41:40.064
URGENT AND IMPORTANT AND I

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:40.664
REALLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME

00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:41.265
AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER

00:41:41.332 --> 00:41:44.902
QUESTIONS. THANK YOU BOTH FOR

00:41:44.969 --> 00:41:47.104
YOUR PRESENTATIONS- COUPLE OF

00:41:47.171 --> 00:41:49.373
QUESTIONS ON PROCESS OF MAYBE

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.007
THE FIRST ONE FOR BOTH OF YOU-

00:41:50.074 --> 00:41:51.508
IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE

00:41:51.575 --> 00:41:53.377
CONCEPT OF CLUSTER HIRING. I

00:41:53.444 --> 00:41:55.079
BELIEVE IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS

00:41:55.145 --> 00:41:57.014
PRACTICE WITH WITHIN THE UC.

00:41:57.081 --> 00:42:01.018
WHICH HAS A GOAL OF- HIRING.

00:42:01.085 --> 00:42:02.953
THE GROUP OF PEOPLE PERHAPS

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:07.524
ACROSS- SPECTRUM OF COMPETENCY

00:42:07.591 --> 00:42:11.262
USER DISCIPLINES. IF YOU COULD

00:42:11.328 --> 00:42:13.530
MAYBE SPEAK MORE ABOUT THAT

00:42:13.597 --> 00:42:14.164
IDEA OF CLUSTER HIRING AND IS

00:42:14.231 --> 00:42:15.532
THAT SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE

00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:16.100
APPLICABLE TO THE COMMUNITY

00:42:16.166 --> 00:42:23.374
COLLEGES. I'M WELL FAMILIAR

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:24.008
WITH THE CLOSER HIGH YOU WERE

00:42:24.074 --> 00:42:27.077
OF RATHER RECENTLY- AND I THINK

00:42:27.144 --> 00:42:29.880
IT'S WORTH- STUDY OF BID IF

00:42:29.947 --> 00:42:30.447
THERE WAS AN ARTICLE IN THE

00:42:30.514 --> 00:42:33.050
CHRONICLE OF HIGHER EDUCATION.

00:42:33.117 --> 00:42:35.185
ON NATIONALLY AROUND THAT AL

00:42:35.252 --> 00:42:35.686
AND I THINK IT'S WORTH

00:42:35.753 --> 00:42:37.354
ANALYZING OF FOR THREE REASONS

00:42:37.421 --> 00:42:39.089
ONE IT'S WORTH ANALYZING

00:42:39.156 --> 00:42:41.292
WHETHER THEY WERE ABLE TO. DO

00:42:41.358 --> 00:42:43.427
THAT WITHOUT VIOLATING PROP TWO

00:42:43.494 --> 00:42:44.028
OH NINE WHICH IS THE NEW WANTS

00:42:44.094 --> 00:42:47.331
OF CALIFORNIA THE SECOND IS

00:42:47.398 --> 00:42:51.168
IT'S INTRIGUING. BECAUSE IT

00:42:51.235 --> 00:42:54.972
FOCUSES ON AREAS OF NEED ALL

00:42:55.039 --> 00:42:57.241
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AROUND

00:42:57.308 --> 00:42:57.775
NEW FUNDING COMING IN FOR

00:42:57.841 --> 00:43:01.045
FACULTY HIRING. IS A AND

00:43:01.111 --> 00:43:03.247
SOMETIMES WE SEE THAT DIVERSITY

00:43:03.314 --> 00:43:05.249
RACIALLY- GROWING UP IS

00:43:05.316 --> 00:43:09.253
ACTUALLY IN THE AREAS OF FOR

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.422
INSTANCE COUNSELING- BUT NOT IN

00:43:11.488 --> 00:43:13.457
AREAS OF STEM TEACHING. AND SO

00:43:13.524 --> 00:43:15.159
BEING ABLE TO DO CLOSER HIRING

00:43:15.225 --> 00:43:17.461
THAT SAYS WE'RE GOING TO

00:43:17.528 --> 00:43:19.430
CLUSTERS CERTAIN AREA LIKE STEM

00:43:19.496 --> 00:43:23.367
OF FOR INSTANCE OF IS

00:43:23.434 --> 00:43:25.436
INTRIGUING A AND IT'S WORTH OF

00:43:25.502 --> 00:43:27.604
FOCUS EXPRESSION KNOWING OR

00:43:27.671 --> 00:43:29.173
LACK OF DIVERSITY IN TOWN. SO

00:43:29.239 --> 00:43:39.083
IF IT WAS A CLUSTER HIGHER. IN

00:43:39.149 --> 00:43:49.026
INSTEAD IT IS THAT. IS TO SEE

00:43:49.093 --> 00:43:51.428
WHETHER IS A AND AGAIN THIS IS

00:43:51.495 --> 00:43:53.397
VERY NEW TO ME SO I THINK IT'S

00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:55.099
VERY MUCH WORTH IT WANTED

00:43:55.165 --> 00:43:57.267
TOWARD EXPORT WE SHOULD EXPLORE

00:43:57.334 --> 00:43:59.636
ALL STRATEGIES- BUT THEN ALSO

00:43:59.703 --> 00:44:01.205
TO SEE WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE

00:44:01.271 --> 00:44:03.474
FOR OUR SYSTEM AS COMMUNITY

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:05.242
COLLEGES BECAUSE WE HAVE.

00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:07.077
CONCEPTS OF FSA'S FACULTY

00:44:07.144 --> 00:44:09.613
SERVICE AREAS AND A WHAT IS THE

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:13.017
ABILITY TO HIRE BROADLY OR

00:44:13.083 --> 00:44:15.152
NARROWLY WITHIN THAT THOSE

00:44:15.219 --> 00:44:15.719
CONFINES OF FACULTY AND OUR

00:44:15.786 --> 00:44:18.989
FACULTY LEADERSHIP- I THINK

00:44:19.056 --> 00:44:19.490
KNOWING THAT WOULD BE

00:44:19.556 --> 00:44:22.893
INTERESTED. IN AT LEAST TAKING

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.229
A LOOK AND EXPLORING A WHAT

00:44:25.295 --> 00:44:25.796
THAT MEANS VIS A VIS THE WAY

00:44:25.863 --> 00:44:27.531
WERE STRUCTURE SO I DON'T KNOW

00:44:27.598 --> 00:44:29.333
AND I CANNOT DEFINITIVELY SAY

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.835
IT'S A IT'S A RIGHT WAY TO GO

00:44:31.902 --> 00:44:33.404
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:35.305
EXPLORING. MISHA ARE THE

00:44:35.372 --> 00:44:37.341
RESEARCH I'VE SEEN AS THE

00:44:37.408 --> 00:44:39.543
CLUSTER HIRING ISN'T REALLY

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:41.478
STRATEGY I AGREE WITH AND ONE

00:44:41.545 --> 00:44:42.046
THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY WORTH

00:44:42.112 --> 00:44:43.614
EXPLORING. YES ONE TOPIC THAT

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:46.917
WE'VE NOT DISCUSSED IS THE

00:44:46.984 --> 00:44:49.119
REALITY THAT WHEN FACULTY THESE

00:44:49.186 --> 00:44:51.555
ARE NOT VERY DIVERSE AND YOU

00:44:51.622 --> 00:44:53.157
ONLY HIRE ONE FACULTY OF COLOR

00:44:53.223 --> 00:44:55.459
THEIR EXPERIENCES SIMILAR TO

00:44:55.526 --> 00:44:57.861
WHAT AT FIRST AND STUDENT

00:44:57.928 --> 00:44:59.363
ARRIVING ON CAMPUS IS. AND SO

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:01.065
IT CAN'T JUST BE ABOUT HIRING A

00:45:01.131 --> 00:45:03.467
DIVERSE POOL IT TO BE ABOUT

00:45:03.534 --> 00:45:05.135
CREATING UGH BUT ENVIRONMENT

00:45:05.202 --> 00:45:07.071
WHERE DIVERSE FACULTY OF COLOR

00:45:07.137 --> 00:45:13.077
FEEL SUPPORTED AND WELCOMED.

00:45:13.143 --> 00:45:13.610
AND I THINK CLUSTER HIRING

00:45:13.677 --> 00:45:14.178
PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:45:14.244 --> 00:45:19.049
THAT. THAT WAS AN ACTUALLY BE

00:45:19.116 --> 00:45:19.583
MY NEXT QUESTION WAS ABOUT

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:20.150
PERSISTENCE PERSISTENCE OF

00:45:20.217 --> 00:45:21.485
FACULTY. AND THE EXPERIENCE OF

00:45:21.552 --> 00:45:23.120
BEING THE ONLY ONE WOULD NOT. I

00:45:23.187 --> 00:45:25.189
HAD A I DO NOT THINK OF MAKE

00:45:25.255 --> 00:45:27.324
ONE YOU KNOW FEEL WE TALKED

00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:29.059
ABOUT THE SENSE OF BELONGING-

00:45:29.126 --> 00:45:33.097
AND THE SENSE OF. BEING PART OF

00:45:33.163 --> 00:45:34.998
THE CAMPUS AND PERHAPS THE IDEA

00:45:35.065 --> 00:45:37.801
OF A- CLUSTER HIRING WOULD

00:45:37.868 --> 00:45:41.305
WOULD HELP. IN THAT AS WELL. I

00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:43.807
IN A GOING BACK TO THE CLUSTER

00:45:43.874 --> 00:45:45.409
HIRING IN THE ISSUE OF- FACULTY

00:45:45.476 --> 00:45:47.678
THERE DIVERSE RACIALLY DIVERSE.

00:45:47.744 --> 00:45:49.746
RETENTION OF THE CHURCHES WITH

00:45:49.813 --> 00:45:52.015
AGAIN VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN

00:45:52.082 --> 00:45:53.450
THE LORI BUT ONE OF THE

00:45:53.517 --> 00:45:55.419
CHALLENGES THINKING THE COLLEGE

00:45:55.486 --> 00:45:57.354
PRESIDENT. IS WE DON'T ACTUALLY

00:45:57.421 --> 00:45:58.989
GET TO HIRE LARGE NUMBERS OF

00:45:59.056 --> 00:46:01.258
FULL TIME FACULTY AND SO THE

00:46:01.325 --> 00:46:03.193
NOTION OF CLUSTER- IS

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:05.295
LOGISTICALLY OF JUST PLAYING IT

00:46:05.362 --> 00:46:07.164
IN MY MIND. AND SO THAT'S WHY I

00:46:07.231 --> 00:46:09.266
THINK AN INFUSION OF MONEY TO

00:46:09.333 --> 00:46:12.936
THE SYSTEM TO HIRE NEW FACULTY-

00:46:13.003 --> 00:46:15.272
OTHERWISE RIGHT NOW IT'S A

00:46:15.339 --> 00:46:16.840
SCENARIO WHEN FACULTY LEAVE AND

00:46:16.907 --> 00:46:19.109
VACANCY STICKER. OF THE WITH

00:46:19.176 --> 00:46:19.710
THE NEW FUSION OF MONEY INTO

00:46:19.776 --> 00:46:21.512
NEW FACULTY HIRING WE MAY HAVE

00:46:21.578 --> 00:46:23.280
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE

00:46:23.347 --> 00:46:25.282
OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE

00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.883
CLUSTER HIRING SO JUST- JUST

00:46:25.949 --> 00:46:29.286
WANT TO NOTE THAT. OF FACULTY

00:46:29.353 --> 00:46:31.188
OF THAT PARTICULAR- DIVERSE

00:46:31.255 --> 00:46:33.157
RACIALLY FACULTY OF- AND THEIR

00:46:33.223 --> 00:46:36.827
RETENTION IS ACTUALLY A VERY

00:46:36.894 --> 00:46:37.427
IMPORTANT NOTION WITHIN THE

00:46:37.494 --> 00:46:39.463
CONCEPT OF EQUAL EMPLOYMENT

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:41.398
OPPORTUNITY. AND IN FACT THERE

00:46:41.465 --> 00:46:43.400
WAS A DISSERTATION THAT WAS

00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:45.802
DONE IN THE ORANGE COUNTY LA AT

00:46:45.869 --> 00:46:49.106
THE COLLEGES- IT ONE

00:46:49.173 --> 00:46:51.008
DISSERTATION OF THE YEAR AND IT

00:46:51.074 --> 00:46:53.443
SHOWED. OF THE ISOLATION THE

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:55.212
FACULTY OF COLOR HALF AND MANY

00:46:55.279 --> 00:46:57.481
OF THEM IF THEY'RE NOT LEAVING-

00:46:57.548 --> 00:47:01.385
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES- AND

00:47:01.451 --> 00:47:02.052
DECIDE TO STILL STAY BECAUSE OF

00:47:02.119 --> 00:47:03.120
THEIR LOVE FOR TEACHING. A MANY

00:47:03.187 --> 00:47:05.389
OF THEM ACTUALLY DO NOT GET

00:47:05.455 --> 00:47:07.291
INVOLVED IN LEADERSHIP SO NOT

00:47:07.357 --> 00:47:09.493
INVOLVED IN THEIR LOCAL SENATE

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.628
NOT INVOLVED IN HIRING PROCESS

00:47:11.695 --> 00:47:12.196
CEDAR CHESTS TEACHING AND

00:47:12.262 --> 00:47:14.965
FINING THAT LOVE TO THE

00:47:15.032 --> 00:47:15.532
TEACHING AND NOT SERVING THE

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:19.102
COLLEGE COMMUNITY. BECAUSE THEY

00:47:19.169 --> 00:47:21.271
FEEL RACIALLY ISOLATED AND SO

00:47:21.338 --> 00:47:23.273
THE NOTION OF A IT'S NOT ABOUT

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:25.075
RETENTION BUT REALLY TAKING

00:47:25.142 --> 00:47:27.277
FULL ADVANTAGE. OF THE RICH

00:47:27.344 --> 00:47:29.313
DIVERSITY THE FACULTY OF COLOR

00:47:29.379 --> 00:47:31.215
BRING TO A CAMPUS IT IS TO THE

00:47:31.281 --> 00:47:33.550
DETRIMENT OF THE COLLEGE NOT TO

00:47:33.617 --> 00:47:43.060
ENSURE THAT FACULTY OF COLOR-

00:47:43.126 --> 00:47:43.660
FEEL WELCOME SUPPORTED VERSUS

00:47:43.727 --> 00:47:49.499
FEELING REYES. ISOLATED I ALSO

00:47:49.566 --> 00:47:50.100
WANT TO MAKE A POINT. IN THAT

00:47:50.167 --> 00:47:51.969
IS THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT AT

00:47:52.035 --> 00:47:52.436
LEAST THE ONE FOR THE

00:47:52.502 --> 00:47:53.437
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:47:53.503 --> 00:47:53.971
THAT THE RATE THE RACIAL

00:47:54.037 --> 00:47:57.174
STUDENT EQUITY GAP NARAL BY

00:47:57.241 --> 00:47:57.774
NINETEEN TO FIFTY ONE PERCENT.

00:47:57.841 --> 00:47:59.042
BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. THAT

00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.610
MEANS THERE'S ABOUT ANOTHER

00:47:59.676 --> 00:48:01.278
HALF. THAT DOES NOT AT THE GAP

00:48:01.345 --> 00:48:03.280
HAS NOT CLOSE SO WHAT THAT

00:48:03.347 --> 00:48:05.449
MEANS IS THE BURDEN OF RACIAL

00:48:05.515 --> 00:48:07.351
EQUITY AND CLOSING THE RACIAL

00:48:07.417 --> 00:48:09.353
EQUITY GAFFER STUDENTS SHOULD

00:48:09.419 --> 00:48:11.388
NOT BE BASED ENTIRELY. ON

00:48:11.455 --> 00:48:13.523
FACULTY OF COLOR THEY ARE

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:17.094
DEFINITELY OF CRITICAL STRATEGY

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.162
BUT IT IS FOR ALL FACULTY NO

00:48:19.229 --> 00:48:23.367
MATTER WHAT RACE THAT THEY MUST

00:48:23.433 --> 00:48:24.001
BE ENGAGED AROUND THE ISSUE OF

00:48:24.067 --> 00:48:25.235
STUDENT ACTIVITY AND AROUND

00:48:25.302 --> 00:48:27.137
CULTURAL RESPONSIVENESS. AND

00:48:27.204 --> 00:48:29.506
AROUND IMPLICIT BIAS TOWARD

00:48:29.573 --> 00:48:31.141
EACH OTHER AND TOWARD STUDENTS

00:48:31.208 --> 00:48:37.147
SO IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF

00:48:37.214 --> 00:48:37.714
ALL NOT JUST FOR FACULTY OF

00:48:37.781 --> 00:48:43.020
COLOR. THE FIGURES THAT- WE

00:48:43.086 --> 00:48:43.620
HAVE IN FRONT OF US THAT THE

00:48:43.687 --> 00:48:45.555
COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY- HAS

00:48:45.622 --> 00:48:46.123
PROVIDED. AND THANK YOU FOR

00:48:46.189 --> 00:48:49.226
THAT WORK- LOOKING AT NON

00:48:49.293 --> 00:48:53.163
TENURED FACULTY. I THINK I AM

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:55.165
SURPRISED. THAT A THE LAST

00:48:55.232 --> 00:48:57.868
DIVERSITY WITH PART TIME

00:48:57.934 --> 00:49:00.871
FACULTY PURSES FULL TIME

00:49:00.937 --> 00:49:03.507
FACULTY. I AND I AND I WONDER

00:49:03.573 --> 00:49:04.107
IF OTHERS YOU KNOW MAY HAVE

00:49:04.174 --> 00:49:07.311
BEEN SURPRISED AS I AM BECAUSE

00:49:07.377 --> 00:49:11.048
IT WOULD SEEM LIKE THE POOL.

00:49:11.114 --> 00:49:11.715
THAT WE'RE DRYING FROM FOR PART

00:49:11.782 --> 00:49:13.417
TIME FACULTY. CERTAINLY SEEMS

00:49:13.483 --> 00:49:17.087
TO BE MUCH BETTER. THEN THEN

00:49:17.154 --> 00:49:20.991
THE POOL FOR FULL TIME FACULTY

00:49:21.058 --> 00:49:23.260
SO IF BOTH OF YOU EITHER OF YOU

00:49:23.327 --> 00:49:25.262
MIGHT WANT TO ADDRESS WHY WHY

00:49:25.329 --> 00:49:28.965
DO YOU THINK THAT IS WHY WHY IS

00:49:29.032 --> 00:49:31.001
THE PART TIME FACULTY NUMBERS.

00:49:31.068 --> 00:49:35.272
ACTUALLY YES ACTUALLY SMALLER

00:49:35.339 --> 00:49:35.906
LESS DIVERSE THAN THE FULL TIME

00:49:35.972 --> 00:49:43.547
FACULTY. WELL YOU KNOW I THINK

00:49:43.613 --> 00:49:44.181
IT IS CERTAINLY SURPRISING FOR

00:49:44.247 --> 00:49:47.150
US WHEN WE WERE DOING THE

00:49:47.217 --> 00:49:47.651
RESEARCH WE WERE TOLD BY

00:49:47.718 --> 00:49:51.355
SEVERAL. SEVERAL FACULTY ON

00:49:51.421 --> 00:49:53.090
CAMPUSES THAT WE NEEDED. YOU

00:49:53.156 --> 00:49:55.425
KNOW TAKE OUT TENURE TO NON

00:49:55.492 --> 00:49:58.895
TENURED- BECAUSE FACULTY WERE

00:49:58.962 --> 00:49:59.463
SAYING THAT IN FACT THE NON

00:49:59.529 --> 00:50:01.098
TENURED WERE LESS DIVERSE AND

00:50:01.164 --> 00:50:01.665
YET THE ARGUMENT WAS ALWAYS

00:50:01.732 --> 00:50:05.068
THIS IS A PIPELINE ISSUE RIGHT-

00:50:05.135 --> 00:50:05.669
AND SO THE PIPELINE WILL GET

00:50:05.736 --> 00:50:07.471
MORE DIVERSE IF WE JUST WAIT

00:50:07.537 --> 00:50:09.639
LONG ENOUGH- AND SO I DON'T

00:50:09.706 --> 00:50:11.508
KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS I THINK

00:50:11.575 --> 00:50:13.443
YOU KNOW I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:13.977
HEAR FROM OTHER FOLKS ON

00:50:14.044 --> 00:50:15.345
CAMPUSES THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO

00:50:15.412 --> 00:50:17.414
SPEAK TO IT BETTER. BUT I WOULD

00:50:17.481 --> 00:50:18.915
SAY THAT CLEARLY THERE IS-

00:50:18.982 --> 00:50:21.218
BROKE IN HIRING AND VETTING

00:50:21.284 --> 00:50:25.021
PROCESS THAT ISN'T BEING

00:50:25.088 --> 00:50:27.090
INTENTIONAL ABOUT DIVERSITY AND

00:50:27.157 --> 00:50:28.892
EQUITY IN A WAY THAT WOULD

00:50:28.959 --> 00:50:30.961
PRODUCE DIFFERENT NUMBERS ONE

00:50:31.027 --> 00:50:33.263
OF THE THINGS IN THE REPORT

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:33.897
THAT WE TALK ABOUT BECAUSE OF A

00:50:33.964 --> 00:50:35.232
THE OTHER ARGUMENT IT'S OFTEN

00:50:35.298 --> 00:50:37.334
MADE AS WELL THERE ARE FEWER

00:50:37.401 --> 00:50:43.106
LET NEXT AND AFRICAN AMERICAN

00:50:43.173 --> 00:50:45.041
AND FOLKS WITH. YOU KNOW.

00:50:45.108 --> 00:50:47.511
ADVANCED DEGREES SO THE POOL IS

00:50:47.577 --> 00:50:49.012
SMALLER AND WHAT WE FIND IS

00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:49.646
WELL THE YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S

00:50:49.713 --> 00:50:52.048
PRODUCING A LOT OF GRADUATES

00:50:52.115 --> 00:50:53.150
THAT ARE. PEOPLE OF COLOR AND

00:50:53.216 --> 00:50:55.419
SO THAT EXCUSE DOESN'T HOLD

00:50:55.485 --> 00:50:57.187
VERY WELL AND IN THE UC WE SAY

00:50:57.254 --> 00:50:59.589
YOU SEE HAS A STUDENT BODY.

00:50:59.656 --> 00:51:01.291
WHERE THE LARGEST ETHNIC GROUP

00:51:01.358 --> 00:51:03.427
IS ASIAN AMERICAN AND YET THEY

00:51:03.493 --> 00:51:05.262
HAVE- A HUGE GAP IN

00:51:05.328 --> 00:51:09.332
REPRESENTATION AMONGST FACULTY

00:51:09.399 --> 00:51:11.101
FOR THEIR STUDENTS- AND WE ARE

00:51:11.168 --> 00:51:13.303
PRODUCING. A LOT OF ASIAN

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:15.539
AMERICAN GRADUATES SO THE

00:51:15.605 --> 00:51:17.207
ARGUMENT DOESN'T HOLD IF YOUR

00:51:17.274 --> 00:51:19.242
SYSTEM IS BROKEN. IF YOUR

00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:19.776
SYSTEM DOESN'T CARE ABOUT

00:51:19.843 --> 00:51:21.545
DIVERSITY AN ACT IN A VERY REAL

00:51:21.611 --> 00:51:23.246
AN INTENTIONAL WAY IT'S GOING

00:51:23.313 --> 00:51:25.282
TO CONTINUE TO REPRODUCE. THESE

00:51:25.348 --> 00:51:27.150
HIRING COMMITTEES ARE LOOKING

00:51:27.217 --> 00:51:29.219
FOR PEOPLE THAT. YOU KNOW- LOOK

00:51:29.286 --> 00:51:31.188
LIKE THEM. OFTENTIMES IN TERMS

00:51:31.254 --> 00:51:33.190
OF WHAT THEY VALUE AS

00:51:33.256 --> 00:51:37.060
EXPERIENCE WITH THE VALUE AS-

00:51:37.127 --> 00:51:39.362
YOU KNOW QUALITY RESEARCH IF

00:51:39.429 --> 00:51:41.198
THAT'S THE CASE FOR YOU SEE

00:51:41.264 --> 00:51:45.469
PROFESSOR EXCITER. I FIVE EIGHT

00:51:45.535 --> 00:51:47.304
A FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU SO

MUCH TO THE CAMPAIGN AND TO THE

00:51:49.239 --> 00:51:51.107
AIR FOR FOCUSING ON THE PART

00:51:51.174 --> 00:51:52.909
TIME FACULTY AS I MENTIONED

00:51:52.976 --> 00:51:53.510
THIS IS A RAPIDLY. A REALLY

00:51:53.577 --> 00:51:56.913
CRITICAL AREA FOR A STUDENT

00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:57.447
THEY MAKE NO DISTINCTION

00:51:57.514 --> 00:51:59.382
BETWEEN A PART TIME AND FULL

00:51:59.449 --> 00:52:01.485
TIME FACULTY YOU'RE MY FACULTY.

A TASK FORCE WHAT WE DECIDED

01:05:47.043 --> 01:05:51.614
WAS THAT WE AGREE ON A FEW NOT

ONLY DID SIT DOWN LOOKED AT.

01:05:55.117 --> 01:06:00.923
LEAST THE STORE HUMANS OF OUR.

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:01.524
TO LEARN. IS BY TRAINING A WE

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:03.225

THE DATA THAT RECOGNIZED

01:06:16.972 --> 01:06:17.473
BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO WE

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:19.342
THAT CONCEPT TO MOVE FORWARD

01:06:19.408 --> 01:06:20.876
TOGETHER HAS A SYSTEM. THE

ENGAGED IN. ON SLIDE FOURTEEN

01:10:19.315 --> 01:10:19.848
THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS VOTED

UNANIMOUSLY ON THESE THREE

01:10:21.216 --> 01:10:23.252
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT FIRST

01:10:23.319 --> 01:10:25.321
RECOMMENDATION IS ACTUALLY A

01:10:25.387 --> 01:10:27.623
SIXTEEN PAGE REPORT OF

01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:31.160
STRATEGIES TO CHANGE

REGULATIONS PROCEDURES AND SENT

01:10:35.331 --> 01:10:35.864
SOME BEST PRACTICES. I THINK A

01:10:35.931 --> 01:10:37.132
KEY PART OF THE WORD IS YOU

01:10:41.236 --> 01:10:43.105
IN RESOURCE ARE NEEDED BUT A

01:10:43.172 --> 01:10:47.109
LOT OF WORK IS ALSO WE CAN. ONE

01:10:47.176 --> 01:10:51.013
OF THE LEVERS TO DO THIS WORK

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:51.680
AND HOW IT'S A COMPLIANCE LEVER

01:10:51.747 --> 01:10:53.382
BUT OUR TASK FORCE ALSO

01:10:53.449 --> 01:10:55.150
IDENTIFIED DIFFERENT THINGS

01:10:55.217 --> 01:10:58.887
THAT CAN BE DONE ON ON THOSE

01:10:58.954 --> 01:11:01.090
SIXTEEN PAGES. THE FIRST IS A

01:11:01.156 --> 01:11:03.659
TIER ONE ACT HE WHICH- CAN BE

01:11:03.726 --> 01:11:09.298
DONE EXISTING. SO MEANING DONE.

01:11:09.365 --> 01:11:09.832
SO I PROVIDE YOU TO REALLY

01:11:09.898 --> 01:11:11.433
BRIEF EXAMPLES BUT THE ONE I

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:11.967
WANT TO FOCUS ON IS SLIDE

01:11:12.034 --> 01:11:15.170
NUMBER SEVENTEEN. SO THE VISION

01:11:15.237 --> 01:11:17.072
FOR SUCCESS HAS SEVEN

01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:19.341
COMMITMENTS AND ONE OF THOSE

01:11:19.408 --> 01:11:19.875
COMMITMENTS IS COMMITMENT

01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:21.910
NUMBER THREE. I EXPECTATIONS

01:11:21.977 --> 01:11:27.549
SUPPORT. WHAT ARE TASK DECIDED

01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:29.018
WAS THAT ONE OF THE STRATEGIES

01:11:29.084 --> 01:11:31.220
IN WHICH WE CAN PAYER HIGH

01:11:31.286 --> 01:11:33.155
EXPECTATIONS WITH HIGH SUPPORT

01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:35.024
IS TO ESTABLISH A PIPELINE

01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:36.959
PROGRAM TODAY THE FIRE FACULTY

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:41.263
APPLICANT POOL THIS IS ONE OF

01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:41.864
THE WAYS IN WHICH IN BOTH IN

01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:47.169
PRIVATE OF THE QUIRK LIGHTS HOW

01:11:47.236 --> 01:11:47.770

YOU MAY HAVE HEARD. TO POST

01:11:49.271 --> 01:11:51.707
IT'S ONE OF THOSE EXIT. IN OUR

01:11:51.774 --> 01:11:52.274
SYSTEM WE IDENTIFY TIER ONE

01:11:52.341 --> 01:11:53.642
THESE AS A WAY TO MOBILIZE AND

01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:55.210
TO CREATE THAT FACULTY

01:11:55.277 --> 01:11:55.811
APPLICANT POOL AND DIVERSIFY

01:11:55.878 --> 01:11:57.613

CLARITY. NEWMAN QUALIFICATIONS

01:12:05.554 --> 01:12:07.256
OF TACKLE T. AND I'M SURE THE

01:12:07.322 --> 01:12:07.890
MIX AND IT WILL SPEAK A LITTLE

01:12:07.956 --> 01:12:09.425
BIT MORE ABOUT THIS LATER. A

01:12:09.491 --> 01:12:13.228
LOT OF CONCEPTION OUR SYSTEM

01:12:13.295 --> 01:12:14.930
ABOUT WHAT IS REQUIRED VERSES

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:19.034
WHAT IS PREFERRED IF YOU TITLE

01:12:19.101 --> 01:12:19.668
FIVE THERE WE TO MINIMUM POLICY

01:12:19.735 --> 01:12:23.439
IS FOR FACULTY. SO WE BELIEVE

01:12:23.505 --> 01:12:25.340
THAT BY A TV. ONE SEVENTY

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:27.476
NUMBER ONE YOU SEE ON HERE THAT

01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:29.044
WE CAN BEGIN TO CHIP AWAY. TO

01:12:29.111 --> 01:12:31.213
CLARIFY THAT FOR SYSTEM. TV IS

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:31.780
TO CREATE A STATEWIDE PILOT

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:35.050
FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM TO HELP

01:12:35.117 --> 01:12:35.718

IF THEY ARE IN FACT THE MOST

01:12:39.421 --> 01:12:41.090
DIVERSE. SEGMENT OF OUR

01:12:41.156 --> 01:12:43.158
COLLEGES WHY NOT FIGURE OUT HOW

01:12:43.225 --> 01:12:43.726
TO LET THEM COME BACK IN

01:12:43.792 --> 01:12:47.229
TEACHER CAMPUSES AND WE HAVE

01:12:47.296 --> 01:12:48.997
SEEN HUGE MOVEMENT ARE

01:12:49.064 --> 01:12:51.500
HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND

01:12:51.567 --> 01:12:55.037
GRADUATE GRAD FROM PROGRAM THAT

01:12:55.104 --> 01:12:57.206
ARE COMING BACK TO OUR STATE

01:12:57.272 --> 01:13:00.943
WITH MASTER DEGREES SO I THINK

01:13:01.009 --> 01:13:03.545
EIGHTY EIGHT YEARS. CAPTURE

01:13:03.612 --> 01:13:07.049
THOSE STUDENTS. COMING BACK.

01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:09.118
ABOUT TRANSFORMING THE

01:13:09.184 --> 01:13:09.685
STRUCTURE. PROCEEDS TO THEN

01:13:09.752 --> 01:13:11.220
IMPACT THE PRACTICES ARE THIS

01:13:11.286 --> 01:13:13.088
ONE SPECIFICALLY CAME UP

01:13:13.155 --> 01:13:13.689
THROUGH OUR MANY DISCUSSIONS

01:13:13.756 --> 01:13:16.959
ACROSS OUR STATE AND

01:13:17.025 --> 01:13:19.261
CONVERSATIONS WITH MANY

01:13:19.328 --> 01:13:19.862
DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS WITHIN

01:13:19.928 --> 01:13:20.395
THE TASK FORCE. THE CLEAR

01:13:20.462 --> 01:13:23.232
DEFINITION FOR DIVERT. WE

01:13:23.298 --> 01:13:25.033
ACTUALLY DIDN'T HAVE ONE WE HAD

01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:27.369
A VERY GENERIC- LANGUAGE THAT

01:13:27.436 --> 01:13:31.206
IS ACTUALLY BEEN TITLE FIVE THE

01:13:31.273 --> 01:13:31.840
RIVER CITY MEANS A CONDITION OF

01:13:31.907 --> 01:13:33.375
BROAD INCLUSION. IN AN

01:13:33.442 --> 01:13:34.977
ENVIRONMENT IN AN ENVIRONMENT

01:13:35.043 --> 01:13:36.979
THAT OFFERS EQUAL EMPLOYMENT

01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:37.546
OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL PERSONS

01:13:37.613 --> 01:13:41.283
REQUIRES BOTH THE PRESENCE ON

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.850
THE RESPECTFUL TREATMENT OF

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:43.485
INDIVIDUALS. OUR COLLEGES AND

01:13:43.552 --> 01:13:45.454
DISTRICT ASK FOR GUIDANCE AND

01:13:45.521 --> 01:13:49.091
SO RECOMMENDATION NUMBER TWO IS

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:50.959
ACT WAS ACTUALLY THE ADOPTION

01:13:51.026 --> 01:13:51.426
OF A DIVERSITY ECCRINE

01:13:51.493 --> 01:13:53.262
INCLUSIONS MEANT SO WHAT ARE

01:13:53.328 --> 01:13:57.166
VALUES BELIEFS AS A SYSTEM. AND

01:13:57.232 --> 01:13:59.201
THEN HOW CAN WE USE THE

01:13:59.268 --> 01:13:59.768
LANGUAGE THAT WAS ADOPTED TO

01:13:59.835 --> 01:14:03.639
ANTI. SO THAT WOULD LET ME BE A

01:14:03.705 --> 01:14:05.073
SOMETHING THAT WOULD REPORT TO

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:06.875

STATEMENT ON THE STUMP. AS WELL

01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:13.048
AS CHANGING THE EGO. CHANGING

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:13.549
THE TEMPLATE AS WELL AS

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:15.417
CHANGING THE MORE FOR MEASURES

01:14:15.484 --> 01:14:17.352
WHICH IS THE WAY THAT THE STATE

01:14:17.419 --> 01:14:19.121
LEGISLATURE FUNDS ARE EAGLE

01:14:19.188 --> 01:14:20.989
PLANS ALL OF THOSE CHANGES NEED

01:14:21.056 --> 01:14:23.292
TO HAPPEN. IN ORDER FOR US TO

01:14:23.358 --> 01:14:25.093
REALLY HAVE A DEFINITION IN A

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.329
STATEMENT WERE EQUITY DIVERSITY

SHOW YOU THAT VERY FIRST

01:14:35.037 --> 01:14:39.041
PARAGRAPH OF THAT STATEMENT IT

01:14:39.107 --> 01:14:39.641
WAS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO

01:14:39.708 --> 01:14:41.276
START WITH THE STUDENT IN MY-

01:14:41.343 --> 01:14:41.877
THE FIRST SENTENCE IS WITH THE

01:14:41.944 --> 01:14:43.111
GOAL OF ENSURING THAT.

RECOMMEND AND I'M ALMOST

01:14:57.059 --> 01:14:59.194
TOWARDS THE END- IS IT WAS A

01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:00.996
RECOMMENDED ADOPTION OF A

01:15:01.063 --> 01:15:01.630
BUDGET REQUEST FOR THE BOARD OF

YOU SEE THAT ON HERE A

01:16:01.356 --> 01:16:03.091
MODERNIZE HE SEES REGISTRY

01:16:03.158 --> 01:16:05.394
WEBSITE OUR WEBSITE IS

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:07.462
EXTREMELY OLD AND WHAT WE KEEP

PLACE WHERE WE CAN UPLOAD ALL.

01:16:14.269 --> 01:16:17.406
OF THERE AND USE DATA TO

01:16:17.472 --> 01:16:19.241

THAT WEBSITE ONLINE TRAINING

01:16:29.618 --> 01:16:31.420
MODULES VERY IMPORTANT I THINK

01:18:43.085 --> 01:18:43.518
SOME OF THE STUFF BUT I

01:18:43.585 --> 01:18:45.187
UNDERSTAND THE NECESSITY TO

01:18:45.253 --> 01:18:53.195

FROM THE PREVIOUS CONVERSATION

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:05.173
OR TALKING ABOUT YOU SEEM

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:07.042
PROGRAMS TO HELP US WITH THE

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:07.676
PRESS THE BIAS AND AT THE END

01:19:07.742 --> 01:19:09.010
OF THE THIRD DEFINITELY TOOLS

01:19:09.077 --> 01:19:11.113
BUT WE NEED TO BE AWARE. OF THE

01:19:11.179 --> 01:19:11.713
LIMITATIONS TO HANDLE SCHOOLS

01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:12.881
BECAUSE WHEN THEY'RE BEING

01:19:12.948 --> 01:19:15.617
BUILT OUT THAT BY THIRTY IN

01:19:15.684 --> 01:19:17.185
THEM A LOT OF NICE CORRECT ALL

01:19:17.252 --> 01:19:19.254
OF IT. ALONG THE WAY AND SO WE

01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:23.859
NEED TO BE AWARE THAT WHILE THE

01:19:23.925 --> 01:19:27.129
LIMITATION DOESN'T CORRECT FOR

01:19:27.195 --> 01:19:29.164
THE IMPLICIT BIAS BECAUSE OF

01:19:29.231 --> 01:19:37.372
THE DISSENTERS. PEOPLE HAD A

01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:38.006
VISIT BY THAT THE BUILDING INTO

01:19:38.073 --> 01:19:43.278
A PROGRAM. DOCTOR DOLLARS I

01:19:43.345 --> 01:19:47.182
LOOK LIKE THE SLIDE THAT I

01:19:47.249 --> 01:19:49.217
THINK IT SAYS THAT THAT. PLANS

01:19:49.284 --> 01:19:53.188
DON'T CHANGE PEOPLE. SOMETHING

01:19:53.255 --> 01:19:57.159
LIKE THAT AND SO. COLLEGES THAT

01:19:57.225 --> 01:19:59.661
HAVE MADE EACH AND THEN YOU YOU

01:19:59.728 --> 01:20:01.029
YOU MENTIONED THAT THAT IT TO

01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:01.596
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION SOME

01:20:01.663 --> 01:20:03.231
PEOPLE USED TO LEAVE THE ROOM.

01:20:03.298 --> 01:20:03.832
SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

01:20:03.899 --> 01:20:04.399
SOME COLLEGES HAVE BEEN MORE

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:07.102
SUCCESSFUL THAN OTHERS. IN

01:20:07.169 --> 01:20:09.137
DIVERSIFYING THEIR FACULTY. AND

01:20:09.204 --> 01:20:09.771
UNDERSTAND THAT AT SOME OF THE

01:20:09.838 --> 01:20:11.273
PLACES WHERE THAT IS HAPPENING

01:20:11.339 --> 01:20:15.043
THERE ARE EXPERIENCING PUSH

01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.610
BACK IF THAT A GOOD USE THAT

01:20:15.677 --> 01:20:19.281
PHRASE. FROM FROM THE COLLEGES

01:20:19.347 --> 01:20:21.316
THEMSELVES OR FROM FACULTY

01:20:21.383 --> 01:20:23.518
THEMSELVES OF FROM EXISTING

01:20:23.585 --> 01:20:25.654
FACULTY HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:31.459
THAT. NO I THERE IS THERE IS A

01:20:31.526 --> 01:20:33.094
LOT OF I CAN TELL YOU IN IN

01:20:33.161 --> 01:20:35.630
DOING THIS WORK- YOU KNOW IS

01:20:35.697 --> 01:20:36.998
VERY IMPORTANT TO US TO FOCUS

01:20:37.065 --> 01:20:39.267
ON YES THE PRE HIRING THE

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:39.868
HIRING BUT VERY IMPORTANT ON

01:20:39.935 --> 01:20:41.269
THE RETENTION PIECE. RIGHT

01:20:41.336 --> 01:20:43.271
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH- FUNDING

01:20:43.338 --> 01:20:45.273
THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE A

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:49.077
DIFFERENCE UNLESS WE BEGIN TO

01:20:49.144 --> 01:20:51.313
DO THE STRUCTURAL CHANGES AT

01:20:51.379 --> 01:20:57.152
OUR CAMPUSES- WHAT I FOUND WAS

01:20:57.219 --> 01:20:57.719
WANTED TO CREATE A PANEL. OF

01:20:57.786 --> 01:21:02.991
FIVE COLOR. STORIES WITH UPS

01:21:03.058 --> 01:21:03.525
THOUGHT WHAT WOULD TAKE TO

01:21:03.592 --> 01:21:04.092
RETAIN THEM AND WHAT THEY GO

01:21:04.159 --> 01:21:07.362
THROUGH. I FAILED I GETTING AN

01:21:07.429 --> 01:21:09.297
INITIAL PANEL TO COME AND SPEAK

01:21:09.364 --> 01:21:09.931
TO OUR TASK FORCE AND I HAD TO

01:21:09.998 --> 01:21:11.399
ASK FOR HELP. AND EVERY SINGLE

01:21:11.466 --> 01:21:13.268
PERSON HAD ASKED WAS AND I

01:21:13.335 --> 01:21:13.835
DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THE TIME

01:21:13.902 --> 01:21:17.339
WAS NOT TEN YEARS. AND SO WHAT

01:21:17.405 --> 01:21:18.907
HAPPENED WAS THAT THEY SHARED

01:21:18.974 --> 01:21:20.909
THAT THEY WERE NOT COMFORTABLE

01:21:20.976 --> 01:21:21.543
WITH COMING UP IN SHARING THEIR

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:22.210
STORIES IN SACRAMENTO. AND SO I

01:21:22.277 --> 01:21:22.978
ASKED FOR HELP AND EVENTUALLY

01:21:23.044 --> 01:21:23.545
THE PANEL THAT WE GOT WERE

01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:25.180
INCREDIBLE SENATE PRESIDENTS IN

01:21:25.247 --> 01:21:27.382
OUR STATE WHO HAD TENURE. AND

01:21:27.449 --> 01:21:30.919
WHO WERE WERE NOT A FREE

01:21:30.986 --> 01:21:31.453
COURAGEOUS TO SHARE THEIR

01:21:31.519 --> 01:21:33.321
STORIES WITH OUR TASK FORCE. I

01:21:33.388 --> 01:21:34.923
THINK THAT WILL BE VERY COMMON

01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:37.058
THAT'S THE WORK THAT WE'VE SEEN

01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:37.626
IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE WORK

01:21:37.692 --> 01:21:39.661
SITES I THINK THOSE CAMPUSES

01:21:39.728 --> 01:21:41.129
THAT ARE DOING REALLY WELL.

01:21:41.196 --> 01:21:43.365
HAVE LEADERSHIP. AND I THINK

01:21:43.431 --> 01:21:44.933
YOU HEARD THAT VERY CLEARLY

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.135
FROM THE FIRST PANEL

01:21:47.202 --> 01:21:47.769
SPECIFICALLY. FROM TWENTY WHO

01:21:47.836 --> 01:21:49.371
TALKED ABOUT HOW THIS WORK GETS

01:21:49.437 --> 01:21:53.441
IMPLEMENTED. A PART OF OUR JOB

01:21:53.508 --> 01:21:54.075
AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IS

01:21:54.142 --> 01:21:57.112
TO CREATE THOSE. POLICIES THOSE

01:21:57.178 --> 01:21:59.414
STRUCTURES RIGHT IN WHICH FOLKS

01:21:59.481 --> 01:22:01.149
HAVE TO OPERATE UNDER BUT AT

01:22:01.216 --> 01:22:03.485
THE LOCAL LEVEL IT COMES DOWN

01:22:03.551 --> 01:22:04.019
TO LEADERSHIP AND I THINK

01:22:04.085 --> 01:22:07.188
YOU'LL HEAR THAT CLEARLY VERY

01:22:07.255 --> 01:22:07.722
LOUD. IN SOME OF THE OTHER

01:22:07.789 --> 01:22:11.626
PANELISTS WERE COMING UP. TALK

01:22:11.693 --> 01:22:13.161
ABOUT A CULTURAL. SHIFT IN THE

01:22:13.228 --> 01:22:16.197
CULTURE. ESPECIALLY IN

01:22:16.264 --> 01:22:19.367
COMMUNITY COLLEGES WERE WERE I

01:22:19.434 --> 01:22:23.305
BELIEVE OF THE POOL. I THINK IT

01:22:23.371 --> 01:22:27.108
IS A SHELVE STATED. COLLEGE

01:22:27.175 --> 01:22:28.943
OPPORTUNITY HAS SHOWN THE WE'VE

01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:30.979
CERTAINLY GRADUATING A DIVERSE.

01:22:31.046 --> 01:22:33.415
NUMBER OF THE STUDENTS AND WE

01:22:33.481 --> 01:22:37.619
HAVE FOR MANY YEARS NOW- WITH

01:22:37.686 --> 01:22:39.354
MASTERS AND NOT IN MANY MANY

01:22:39.421 --> 01:22:43.091
AREAS- AND AMONG THOSE ARE OUR

01:22:43.158 --> 01:22:47.128
STUDENTS OF COLOR RIGHT WHO ARE

01:22:47.195 --> 01:22:47.629
COMING OUT WITH MASTER'S

01:22:47.696 --> 01:22:49.364
DEGREES. BUT THEN. VERY OFTEN I

01:22:49.431 --> 01:22:53.435
CONTINUE TO HEAR STORIES OF

01:22:53.501 --> 01:22:56.838
COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHO WHO.

01:22:56.905 --> 01:22:59.140
WOULD GO BEYOND THE MASTERS AND

01:22:59.207 --> 01:22:59.741
LOOK FOR THAN SOMEONE WITH THE

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:05.113
DOCTOR. WHICH TO ME MAKES NO

01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:07.349
SENSE AT ALL. GIVEN THE

01:23:07.415 --> 01:23:09.117
STUDENTS THAT COMMUNITY

01:23:09.184 --> 01:23:13.154
COLLEGES ARE TEACHING. FIFTY

01:23:13.221 --> 01:23:17.025
NINE PERCENT- STUDENTS OF COLOR.

01:23:17.092 --> 01:23:19.327
I'M NOT SURE THE NUMBERS I

01:23:19.394 --> 01:23:21.229
DON'T HAVE IN FRONT OF ME HOW

01:23:21.296 --> 01:23:24.966
MANY OF THEM YOU KNOW WE SAW

01:23:25.033 --> 01:23:27.469
WE'RE NOT COLLEGE READY IN

01:23:27.535 --> 01:23:31.306
ENGLISH AND MATH. I PERSONALLY

01:23:31.373 --> 01:23:33.208
DON'T THINK THAT. YOU KNOW I

01:23:33.274 --> 01:23:39.147
RESPECT ANY FACULTY WHO HAS A

01:23:39.214 --> 01:23:41.516
PHD A RESPECTED OF THE WORK

01:23:41.583 --> 01:23:43.184
THEY DID BUT CERTAINLY IT IS

01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:47.856
NOT NECESSARY TO HAVE A PHD TO

01:23:47.922 --> 01:23:48.490
TEACH AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND

01:23:48.556 --> 01:23:51.526
N. F. DEPARTMENTS. CONTINUE TO

01:23:51.593 --> 01:23:57.265
OF. PHD TO A AN APPLICANT WITH

01:23:57.332 --> 01:24:00.001
A MASTERS IN JUST IN DOING THAT

01:24:00.068 --> 01:24:07.008
THEY ARE SELECTING OUT PERHAPS.

01:24:07.075 --> 01:24:07.509
APPLICANTS WHO ARE RICH

01:24:07.575 --> 01:24:09.043
APPLICANTS OF COLOR WHO COULD

01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:13.181
BE VERY SUCCESSFUL IN TEACHING

01:24:13.248 --> 01:24:14.983
I LIKE THE IDEA OF THE PIPELINE

01:24:15.049 --> 01:24:17.051
I LIKE THE IDEA OF UNITY

01:24:17.118 --> 01:24:19.454
COLLEGES SAYING WE ARE GOING TO

01:24:19.521 --> 01:24:20.121
GET THE STUDENTS AND THAT WE'RE

01:24:20.188 --> 01:24:22.957
GOING TO ASK THEM WE'RE GONNA

01:24:23.024 --> 01:24:27.195
TRACK THEM THROUGH. GRADUATE. I

01:24:27.262 --> 01:24:29.597
LIKE THAT CONCEPT BUT IT JUST

01:24:29.664 --> 01:24:30.198
SEEMS LIKE TO ME THAT THE POOL

01:24:30.265 --> 01:24:33.334
EXIST ALREADY. AND WE ARE CLOSE

01:24:33.401 --> 01:24:35.804
ENOUGH. TO THOSE WHO ARE

01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:37.472
ALREADY THERE ALREADY QUALIFIED

01:24:37.539 --> 01:24:41.743
AND WE DO IT. ABSENT SUBTLE AND

01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:47.215
NOT SO SUBTLE WAYS. SO. AND I

01:24:47.282 --> 01:24:49.417
DO HEAR THAT I HEAR THAT FROM

01:24:49.484 --> 01:24:53.655
APPLICANTS. I YOUR THAT QUITE A

01:24:53.721 --> 01:24:57.792
BIT. RESPOND I THINK THERE ARE

01:24:57.859 --> 01:25:01.129
TWO KEY AREAS AND DOCTOR JOHN

01:25:01.196 --> 01:25:01.696
STANCES CAN BE A LOT MORE

01:25:01.763 --> 01:25:04.866
ELOQUENT THAN I CAN TALK ABOUT-

01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:07.335
EQUIVALENCY PROCESS SEES- AND

01:25:07.402 --> 01:25:09.370
THE ROLE OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE

01:25:09.437 --> 01:25:11.272
IN THAT WORK- BUT THE EXAMPLE

01:25:11.339 --> 01:25:15.143
THAT I GAVE YOU GUYS WAS EASY

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:17.245
ABOUT WHAT IS REQUIRED VERSUS

01:25:17.312 --> 01:25:23.251
PREFERRED. TITLE FIVE. I THINK

01:25:23.318 --> 01:25:25.086
THAT THE FIRST BILL. FIRST IT'S

01:25:25.153 --> 01:25:27.255
BEING IMPLEMENTED A HUNDRED

01:25:27.322 --> 01:25:29.324
EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT WAYS- BUT AS

01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:29.924
SOMEONE WHO HAS A PHD I WOULD

01:25:29.991 --> 01:25:31.626
ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU. JUST

01:25:31.693 --> 01:25:33.728
BECAUSE YOU HAVE ONE DOESN'T

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:34.262
MEAN THAT YOU'RE THE RIGHT

01:25:34.329 --> 01:25:39.667
PERSON TO TEACH OUR. WELL AND

01:25:39.734 --> 01:25:43.271
MY IS IT IT'S ONLY. NOT A

01:25:43.338 --> 01:25:53.114
PREREQUISITE FOR. AND COMMUNITY.

01:25:53.181 --> 01:25:55.316
CONNECT QUESTION WHAT ARE YOU

01:25:55.383 --> 01:25:55.884
TO MINIMUM YEAH SO THE FIRST

01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:57.552
REQUIREMENT IS AN ACADEMIC

01:25:57.619 --> 01:25:58.186
REQUIREMENT WHICH IS TYPICALLY

01:25:58.253 --> 01:25:59.220
A MASTER'S DEGREE ON THE OTHER

ONE IS A SENSITIVITY TO AN

01:26:01.155 --> 01:26:03.124
UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIVERSE

01:26:03.191 --> 01:26:03.725
POPULATION OF OUR STUDENTS SO

01:26:03.791 --> 01:26:06.995

HAVE. TITLE FIVE DOES NOT SAY

01:26:17.572 --> 01:26:21.376
THAT YOU ONLY. QUESTION IT IS

01:26:21.442 --> 01:26:23.211
NOT A YES SIR. BERMAN HAS BEEN

01:26:23.278 --> 01:26:25.246
IMPLEMENTED THROUGH A SERIES OF

01:26:25.313 --> 01:26:25.847
QUESTIONS I THINK ONE- AS WE

01:26:25.914 --> 01:26:27.515
MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS WORK AND

01:26:27.582 --> 01:26:29.217
WHAT THE ACADEMIC SENATE HAS

01:26:29.284 --> 01:26:30.919
COMMITTED TO IS HOW DO WE BEGIN

01:26:30.985 --> 01:26:33.154
TO SHOW GOOD MODELS TO OUR

01:26:33.221 --> 01:26:33.788
COLLEGES AND DISTRICTS AND BEST

01:26:33.855 --> 01:26:35.089
PRACTICES HOW YOU DO THAT. AND

WE WILL THE WAY THAT YOU DO

01:26:35.723 --> 01:26:36.958
THAT IS NOT JUST BY ASKING HE

01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:39.193
SERVED A DIVERSE STUDENT

01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:41.162
POPULATION OR DO YOU HAVE A

01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:41.863
SENSITIVITY IT'S WHAT HAVE BEEN

01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:45.166
THE OUTCOMES OF THOSE STUDENTS

01:26:45.233 --> 01:26:49.637
AND HOW HAVE YOU. CONTRIBUTED

01:26:49.704 --> 01:26:57.145
TO THOSE OUTCOMES. SO. ALI IS

01:26:57.211 --> 01:26:59.013
TALKING ABOUT WE I'VE

01:26:59.080 --> 01:26:59.614
DEFINITELY I'VE I'VE HAD THE

01:26:59.681 --> 01:27:01.416
PRIVILEGE OF TEACHING AND THE

01:27:01.482 --> 01:27:02.016
MIDDLE SCHOOL ALL THE WAY TO

01:27:02.083 --> 01:27:03.418
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL AND

01:27:03.484 --> 01:27:03.985
AT THE UNIVERSITY AND I'VE

01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:07.355
DEFINITELY SEEN IT AT THE

01:27:07.422 --> 01:27:07.956
COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL WHERE

01:27:08.022 --> 01:27:11.359
WE WILL GIVE SO WHAT THE PHD.

01:27:11.426 --> 01:27:16.998
JOB. WALK INTO THE CLASSROOM

01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:17.599
ONE THAT DOESN'T TRANSFER INTO

01:27:17.665 --> 01:27:23.338
DOING. I'VE SEEN IT WITH

01:27:23.404 --> 01:27:31.012
MASSIVE DOSES I WANT TO. HOW DO

01:27:31.079 --> 01:27:33.047
WE DEAL WITH STUDENTS WHO ARE

01:27:33.114 --> 01:27:35.049
COMING IN AND WE NEED TO

01:27:35.116 --> 01:27:35.650
REMEDIATE WHAT DOES THAT LOOK

01:27:35.717 --> 01:27:39.020
LIKE. AND AS A MATH. THE LOS

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:39.654
MATT THAT FIND THAT MOST I AM

01:27:39.721 --> 01:27:41.222
THE MORE TRAINING AND EDUCATION

01:27:41.289 --> 01:27:45.426
WE HAVE THE LEAST REPAIR WE ARE

01:27:45.493 --> 01:27:46.027
TO DEAL WITH THE STUDENTS WHO

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:47.161
CAN'T RELATE TO THEM. EASY FOR

01:27:47.228 --> 01:27:49.397
US. AND THE WAY WE HAVE TAUGHT

01:27:49.464 --> 01:27:49.964
IT HAS WORKED FOR US ALWAYS.

01:27:50.031 --> 01:27:51.232
BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT IT

01:27:51.299 --> 01:27:51.833
DOESN'T WORK FOR THE MAJORITY

01:27:51.899 --> 01:27:53.368
OF PEOPLE OUT THERE. AND THAT'S

01:27:53.434 --> 01:27:53.901
SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA GET

01:27:53.968 --> 01:27:57.372
NECESSARILY ANNA. MASTERS CLASS

01:27:57.438 --> 01:27:59.474
OR PHD CLASS. THAT'S SOMETHING

01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:01.142
THAT SOMETIMES A SOME MORE

01:28:01.209 --> 01:28:01.676
OFTEN IN THE HIGH SCHOOL

01:28:01.743 --> 01:28:03.378
CREDENTIAL LEVEL WE ARE TALKING

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:03.978
ABOUT THOSE THINGS. AND THEN

01:28:04.045 --> 01:28:07.181
THEY- ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE

01:28:07.248 --> 01:28:09.217
THINGS MORE. ARM OUR STUDENTS

01:28:09.283 --> 01:28:11.152
AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IT

01:28:11.219 --> 01:28:15.723
MAKES NO SENSE TO ME. OUT THERE

01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:19.160
SO I THINK. NOT ONLY. OUR

01:28:19.227 --> 01:28:23.164
TALENTED BUT WE ALSO. IT'S ALL

01:28:23.231 --> 01:28:27.201
OVER THE BY THAT THAT WE SEEM

01:28:27.268 --> 01:28:27.769
TO THINK THAT THAT THE GREEN

01:28:27.835 --> 01:28:31.139
LEADS TO BE IN A GOOD. ON IT'S

01:28:31.205 --> 01:28:31.706
BEEN MY EXPERIENCE BUT IT'S

01:28:31.773 --> 01:28:37.078
USUALLY THE OPPOSITE. ABS MY

01:28:37.145 --> 01:28:41.149
LAST QUESTION. THE WORK OF THE

01:28:41.215 --> 01:28:43.284
TASK FORCES AND I REALIZE

01:28:43.351 --> 01:28:45.186
THERE'S A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN

01:28:45.253 --> 01:28:45.653
MY CORRECT DIFFERENT A

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:47.188
COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS IN

01:28:47.255 --> 01:28:51.092
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:55.163
KNOW I KNOW THE DATA. IS PRETTY

01:28:55.229 --> 01:28:59.133
I WOULD I WOULD SAY DISMAL. HOW

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:01.436
DO YOU FEEL YOU KNOW THAT WE

01:29:01.502 --> 01:29:05.339
CHANGED ANYTHING SINCE THE TWO

01:29:05.406 --> 01:29:05.840
MILLION DOLLARS THAT THE

01:29:05.907 --> 01:29:09.143
LEGISLATURE HAS PROVIDED. IS

01:29:09.210 --> 01:29:09.777
READY FOR THE QUESTION I MADE A

01:29:09.844 --> 01:29:13.414
LIST. I THINK THERE WERE THREE

01:29:13.481 --> 01:29:15.116
THINGS THAT HAVE CHANGED SINCE

01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:17.118
YOU PROVIDED THAT FUNDING I

01:29:17.185 --> 01:29:17.719
THINK ONE AS YOU CONTINUE TO

01:29:17.785 --> 01:29:19.554
HAVE THAT- YOU WILL CONTINUE TO

01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:21.122
HOLD THEIR SYSTEM ACCOUNTABLE

01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:23.591
SO IT'S A PART OF THAT THAT-

01:29:23.658 --> 01:29:25.259
COME WHAT COMPELS PEOPLE TO

01:29:25.326 --> 01:29:25.893
TAKE ACTION. I THINK THAT FIRST

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.328
PIECES REALLY IN IN CONTINUE TO

01:29:27.395 --> 01:29:29.564
HIGHLIGHT THIS WHICH IS NOT YOU

01:29:29.630 --> 01:29:30.131
WAS SAID BY THE EARLIER AND

01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:31.632
ALL. I THINK THE OTHER PIECE IS

01:29:31.699 --> 01:29:33.201
OP HIGHLIGHTING. PARTNERSHIPS

01:29:33.267 --> 01:29:35.036
AND I THINK YOU'VE SEEN THAT IN

01:29:35.103 --> 01:29:37.405
THIS WORK- OUR ACADEMIC SENATE

01:29:37.472 --> 01:29:41.242
PARTNER WITH OUR OFFICE TO DO

01:29:41.309 --> 01:29:41.809
THIS WORK AND THAT WILL BE

01:29:41.876 --> 01:29:45.246
CRITICAL AND US BEING ABLE TO

SAID HE'D MOVING FORWARD. AND

01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:47.648
THEN NOT BE ON. SEVERAL

01:29:47.715 --> 01:29:49.250
DIFFERENT PIECES OF THIS

01:29:49.317 --> 01:29:51.352
REQUIRE. FIVE CHANGES DIFFERENT

01:29:51.419 --> 01:29:56.958
REGULATION CHANGE. EXPO IN A

01:29:57.024 --> 01:29:57.525
SPACE LIKE THIS IN PICKING

01:29:57.592 --> 01:29:59.527
THROUGH HOW WE THEN MOBILIZE AN

01:29:59.594 --> 01:30:00.128
ENTIRE SYSTEM HAS BEEN A PART

01:30:00.194 --> 01:30:01.295
OF THE PROGRESS RIGHT I THINK.

01:30:01.362 --> 01:30:03.364
WE CONTINUE TO OPERATE WITHIN

AND THAT THEY WILL NOT GET US

01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:17.779

THE EIGHTIES ON A- I DIDN'T GET

TOO INVOLVED WITH HE'S ON

01:48:45.485 --> 01:48:51.291
CAMPUS I WAS LIKE THE REPORT

THAT THE PREFERRED. TO JUST

01:48:57.497 --> 01:49:05.138
WENT TO THEIR DOG AND. TWO

01:49:05.205 --> 01:49:05.605
THOUSAND TO ONE OF MY

01:49:05.672 --> 01:49:06.940
COLLEAGUES IN SAID GET INVOLVED

01:49:07.007 --> 01:49:07.607
WITH SENATE SO I DID. I'VE BEEN

01:49:07.674 --> 01:49:09.142
ON THE ACADEMIC SENATE FOR

01:49:09.209 --> 01:49:11.211
EIGHTEEN YEARS I'VE BEEN THE

01:49:11.278 --> 01:49:11.845
PRESIDENT FOR THE LAST FOUR. SO

01:49:11.912 --> 01:49:13.346
I THINK IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE I

01:49:13.413 --> 01:49:13.947
WAS TRYING TO DO SOME RESEARCH

01:49:14.014 --> 01:49:14.915
WHEN DID SENATE REALLY GET

01:49:14.981 --> 01:49:15.448
INVOLVED WITH THE HIRING

01:49:15.515 --> 01:49:17.083
PRACTICES HR. THE DIRECTOR OF

THE TIME CAME TO SENATE

01:49:18.985 --> 01:49:19.519
DISCUSSED- THE NEED FOR A SIM

01:49:19.586 --> 01:49:22.022
MAKE CHANGES AND WE WERE ALWAYS

01:49:22.088 --> 01:49:27.427
POSITIVE. WITH WITH- APPROACH

01:49:27.494 --> 01:49:28.028
AND I THINK. THAT WOULD JUST

01:49:28.094 --> 01:49:29.429
SOME QUICK STATS. WITH OUR OUR

01:49:29.496 --> 01:49:31.131
FACULTY IN TWO THOUSAND WE HAD.

01:49:31.197 --> 01:49:31.731
EIGHTY NINE FULL TIME FACULTY

01:49:31.798 --> 01:49:35.168
BY THE TIME A TWO THOUSAND

01:49:35.235 --> 01:49:35.769
EIGHTEEN ROLLED AROUND WE HAD

01:49:35.835 --> 01:49:37.203
HUNDRED FIFTY ONE OF FEMALE

01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:39.539
FACULTY IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTY

01:49:39.606 --> 01:49:43.143
NINE HOME OR 44% AND- BY THE

01:49:43.209 --> 01:49:43.677
TIME TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

01:49:43.743 --> 01:49:45.445
ROLLED AROUND WE HAD SEVENTY

01:49:45.512 --> 01:49:47.614
SIX. THE MALE POPULATION IN TWO

01:49:47.681 --> 01:49:51.818
THOUSAND OF FACULTY WAS FIFTY

01:49:51.885 --> 01:49:52.385
AND IT GREW TO SEVENTY FIVE

01:49:52.452 --> 01:49:55.488
SORT. OF A FEW MORE- AND THEN

01:49:55.555 --> 01:49:59.225
WE DO. HAVE MEANT OKAY BUT- I

01:49:59.292 --> 01:50:03.263
THINK THIS MOVIE CAN INCREASE

01:50:03.330 --> 01:50:07.100
AND I JUST PICKED THE HISPANIC.

01:50:07.167 --> 01:50:07.734
THE WHITE- FULL TIME FACULTY ON

01:50:07.801 --> 01:50:09.402
OUR CAMPUS LIKE MORE TO SAID.

01:50:09.469 --> 01:50:11.104
ON 92% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE

01:50:11.171 --> 01:50:13.039
HISPANIC AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE

01:50:13.106 --> 01:50:16.943
A FACULTY THAT IS 42% HISPANIC.

01:50:17.010 --> 01:50:19.179
BUT THAT'S A GROWTH FROM 21% IN

01:50:19.245 --> 01:50:21.581
TWO THOUSAND SO WE'RE MAKING.

01:50:21.648 --> 01:50:23.083
WE'RE IN WE'RE IN. MAKING

01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:25.251
PROGRESS WE HAVE A FACULTY THAT

01:50:25.318 --> 01:50:27.520
IS. A MORE DIVERSE THAN IT HAS

01:50:27.587 --> 01:50:31.091
BEEN IN THE PAST- WE HAVE HAD

01:50:31.157 --> 01:50:33.393
AN INCREASE IN BLOCK OF AFRICAN

01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:37.163
AMERICAN FACULTY. AND ASIAN. OF

01:50:37.230 --> 01:50:37.731
FACULTY IN EVEN THOUGH WE'VE

01:50:37.797 --> 01:50:44.971
HIRED. USE IT WILL BE SO I

01:50:45.038 --> 01:50:45.538
THINK WHAT AND IN THE VALLEY

01:50:45.605 --> 01:50:47.040
SINCE WE'RE THE ONLY CAMPUS YOU

01:50:47.107 --> 01:50:49.175

01:50:49.242 --> 01:50:51.277
TWENTY MILES AWAY FROM ANY OF

01:50:51.344 --> 01:50:53.213
THE COLLEGES HOME IN SAN DIEGO

01:50:53.279 --> 01:50:55.048
THAT WERE DISTRICT PART OF. A

01:50:55.115 --> 01:51:01.087
WE HAVE A HUGE- TIME FACULTY

01:51:01.154 --> 01:51:01.688
THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HIRE

01:51:01.755 --> 01:51:05.392
FULL TIME FROM WE HAVE

01:51:05.458 --> 01:51:07.293

OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO AFTER.

01:51:10.063 --> 01:51:13.166
HAVING WORKED WITH US. I THINK.

01:51:13.233 --> 01:51:17.203
AXIS DOCUMENT BUT IN TWO

01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:17.737

02:01:01.187 --> 02:01:03.155
THAT I NEEDED TO DISCLOSE THAT
