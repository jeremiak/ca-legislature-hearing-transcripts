WE'VE WAITED IGNORED THIS BILL NOT IGNORED IF WE'D STAYED OFF THIS BILL FOR A WELL KNOWN WE STAYED OUT WE SET OFF THIS BILL FOR A LONG TIME BECAUSE IT WAS A BILL. THAT WAS DESIGNED AND BY ITS TITLE WAS THE PLASTICS CIRCULAR ECONOMY. YOU KNOW REDUCTION ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY OR TWENTY NINETEEN OR WHATEVER AND WE THAT WAS WE'RE FINE WITH THAT YOU KNOW THE THAT THERE'S TWELVE FINDINGS IN THE BILL THERE'S TWELVE FINDINGS IN BILL EIGHTY. ART INDICTMENT ON PLASTIC. AND THE GLASS CONTAINER INDUSTRY OR THIRTY YEARS HAS BEEN COMPETING AGAINST CONTAINER TYPES IN THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY. THAT THAT THAT YOU KNOW AND WHAT WE BELIEVE IS AN UNFAIR LEVEL YOU KNOW WE WE'VE BEEN PAYING PROCESSING FEES AND SUPPORTING THE BOTTLE BILL FOR THIRTY YEARS. AND THERE'S A LOT OF PACKAGING THAT IS NOW THEY USED TO BE IN GLASSES AND OTHER PRODUCTS. HE SAID THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO START LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD FOR THESE PACKAGING MATERIALS. FOR A PACKAGE. FOR A CLASS PACKAGE THAT WE ALREADY BELIEVE IS A CIRCULAR PRODUCT. DOESN'T BELONG IN THIS BILL. AND THEN. AS THIS BILL EVOLVED OVER TIME. AND ESPECIALLY AFTER LAST WEEK WHEN ALTHOUGH THE WHEN THE REGULATORY FOUR FORTY IN THE FIELD FORTY WHEN IN THE BILL. ALL OF A SUDDEN WE SEE THIS BILL IN WITH EVERYTHING WE IN ON YOU LIMIT ALL THE WORDS THE WORD. ASPECT THROUGHOUT THE BILL TO NOW WHEN I READ THE BILL ICE I READ. THE GLASS PACKAGE TO DESERVE IT IS A SINGLE USE PRODUCT UNDER THE DEFINITION BILL SO EVERY EVERY TIME I READ CEILINGS PRODUCT ALL I READ IS CLASS. SO THIS BILLS NOW A GLASS BILL. IT WAS A PLASTIC BILL NOW TO CLASS BILL. AND THAT'S THAT'S. BEEN MY CLIENT READS IT AND- IT'S UNFORTUNATE. THE GLASS TAYLOR IS 1100% RECYCLED A GLASS BOTTLE CAN BE A GLASS BOTTLE. AS LONG AS IT'S HANDLED PROPERLY. WE HAVE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE CLASS MANUFACTURING CALIFORNIA ARE MAKING BOTTLES AT FORTY THREE AND A HALF PERCENT RECYCLED CONTENT. 43% THE MANDATE IS 35% THERE'S SOME BOTTLES COME FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD PROBABLY COME IN AT 506070% WE PAID WE PAY FEES TO SUPPORT THE RECYCLING TRUST WITHIN PAYING FOREVER. WE PAY WE ALREADY PAY. A SECONDARY PROCESSOR TO MOVE TO PROCESS OUR GLASS WITH SOME OF THE THINGS YOU GUYS WANT. FOR ALL THESE OTHER COMPUTER TYPES WE ALREADY DO THERE'S A GLAD THERE'S A SECONDARY PROCESSING INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE SUPPORT. BY BUYING THAT PRODUCT FROM. THE GLASS CONTAINER MANUFACTURES IN CALIFORNIA MADE EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND TONS OF CLASS LAST YEAR. I'M NOT NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND TONS GLASS LAST YEAR IN EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND TONS OF GLASS. WITH BACK INTO EITHER GLASS CONTAINERS OR FIBERGLASS SO WE- WERE BASICALLY IT 89% REAPS. YET WE'RE GONNA GET PUT INTO A REGULATORY FEED PROGRAM. IT IS UNDEFINED IN LIMITED BY THIS LEGISLATURE YOU'RE GONNA GIVE IT ALL TO. CARRY CYCLE LET THEM FIGURE IT OUT IN THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WITH THAT THAT. WE HAVE ISSUES WITH THIS. DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF LIMITS ON THAT ON THAT THE AUTHORITY. YOU KNOW THEY. POWER CYCLE GIVES TO THIS. WHAT IS REASONABLE. I MEAN I DON'T KNOW IT'S A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES RESULT THOUSAND EMPLOYEES RESULT FOR THEM TO COME TO MANAGED PRODUCTS. AND I KNOW. BECAUSE I'VE TALKED SAN AROUND TALK TO A LOT AND I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU SAID TO ME. THERE'S JUST A- THERE THERE WAS A LAW THAT PASSED AND- I DON'T KNOW IT WAS LIKE NINE. NINETY FIVE IT WAS A HAZARDOUS WASTE TOXINS IN PACKAGING Là. IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE COMMITTEE NOW SEATS WERE ALL ABOUT. TOXIC TO PLASTICS AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT PLASTIC CONTAINERS AND THINGS. BUT THE FIRST THING HOW THE DEPARTMENT **** DID COMING OUT THE GATE. AFTER THAT WAS A POLITICOS COME AFTER CLASS. DON'T KNOW WHY SO. THAT'S KIND OF WHERE WE THAT'S THAT. THAT'S THE FAITH THAT WE HAVE IN IRAQ. FORTUNATELY. WE FOR NO VOTE I MEAN WOULD RATHER WE'D RATHER YOU START FROM SCRATCH AND TAKE CLASS OUT OF THIS AND THEN PUSHES FORWARD. ON THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE MY ONLY MY ONLY COMMENT ARE. GLASS WAS ALWAYS IN HE BILL AND- WE DO SPECIFICALLY EXEMPT ALL THE FOLKS WHO ARE. SUBJECT TO THE BOTTOM BILL ALL THE WAY UP TO TWENTY TWENTY SIX IN. AND THAT'S WHY FOLKS LIKE THE MERRY BEVERAGE. YOU KNOW A VERY MAKE MEMBERS OF DROPPED OPPOSITION AND- I'M FRONT TWENTY SIX IS THE ONE THAT SENT THAT SETS LIMITS ON THE REGULATORY STUFF SO. YEAH THERE IS NOT IS NOT SOME HAPHAZARD. NOTICED I BUT WE STARTED WE STARTED WITH THE BILL. EVERYBODY WHO SO AT THE END OF THE PROCESS YOU HAVE A BILL WHERE THE GLASS CONTAINER INDUSTRY THE 100% RECYCLED PRODUCT IS OPPOSING A BILL. THAT THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL IN THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY AND ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE THERE NOW NEUTRAL ALSO THAT'S THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT A TON OF PEOPLE OF A GLASS ARE ACTUALLY. I WILL BE WORKING ON YOU ROBSON RIGHT WE'RE GONNA GET YOUR- WE'RE GONNA GET YOU. OKAY YES SIR. CENTER ALLEN THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN THANK YOU JOHN HERE ON BEHALF THE GROCERY MANUFACTURERS SAID. I'LL ECHO THE KNOWLEDGE MEANS OF YOUR BOTH YOUR WORK IN STAFF WORK AND YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER AND ON THIS BILL ANNOUNCED PROCESS BUT UNFORTUNATELY DO WE DO STILL REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL WE HAVE A VARIETY OF CONCERNS THAT REMAIN I I'LL TRY TO NARROW IT DOWN TO JUST TO. IF POSSIBLE AND THE FIRST BEING THAT YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE THE BILL STILL LAYERS AND QUANTIFIED REGULATORY PROGRAM ON TOP OF ARE BROKEN AND BROKEN RECYCLING SYSTEM. AND IN ADDITION KERN SAID THE POSSIBILITY. PRIVATE EYES TO A SYSTEM THAT COULD COULD CONTINUED UNDERMINED OUR PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE IN OUR PUBLIC RECYCLING SYSTEM WE THINK YOU KNOW WE THINK WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT WE THINK WE CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE. PAYMENTS BASED IN IN THAT AREA AND THEN SECONDLY THAT YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE THAT THAT THE BILL STILL. A DOZEN ALLOCATE AND FULLY SHARE THE RESPONSIBILITY THROUGHOUT THE WASTE TO RESET ST SYSTEM ON EVERY. BE IN IT BOTH FASHION I THINK WE- ONE OF OUR FOR. REMAINS COMMITTED TO MAKING THINGS RECYCLABLE COMPOSTABLE. WE CAN'T DO THAT WE ARE DOING THAT AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO MAKING 1100% OF SINGLE USE PACKAGING. RECYCLABLE COMPOSTABLE BUT AFTER WE MAKE IT. YOU KNOW THERE ARE OTHER PARTS OF THAT WASTE STREAM. NOTABLY CONSUMERS AS WELL AS AS OTHER PIECES OF INFRASTRUCTURE TURNING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THERE'S NOTHING TO COMPARE TO PRECLUDE US IN THE BILL FOR MAKING THAT PRODUCT RECYCLABLE COMPOSTABLE. AND ONLY TO HAVE SOMEBODY THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. THROW IT AWAY OR FOR. A WASTE ENTITY ARE HOLLER TO LAND FILL IT FOR ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS ARE REASONS AND SO. WE'VE WE'VE BEEN COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THIS BILL WITH YOU ALL WITH BOTH THE YOU WE REMAIN COMMITTED WE'D LIKE TO CONTINUE THAT ARE YOU KNOW THAT THAT CAN A MAN AND WORK ON THIS TO THE ENVIRONMENT. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO OPPOSE BUT BUT AGAIN. WILL END AND WANTING TO MAKE AN IMPROVEMENT TO THE SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE STRUCTURE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT. WHAT WE HAVE. CENTER YES SIR. AND THE ARTS NAM WITHOUT GMP LOCAL SEVENTEEN AN- HOUR. AT IN BEHALF OF THE GLASS WORKERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE'S ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED OF US RIGHT NOW.IT'S AN INDUSTRY THAT'S BEEN DECIMATED BY OUTSOURCING AND VARIOUS OTHER THINGS WE LOOK AT THIS BILL AS A POTENTIAL JOB KILLER IN OUR INDUSTRY. AND NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS THE NATION THIS BILL COULD POTENTIALLY HURT COULD GLASS JOBS ACROSS THE NATION. AND THE REASON WHY I SAY GOOD GLASS JOB BECAUSE THESE JOBS ARE HIGH PAYING HIGH WAGE UNION JOB. AND THE WAY THAT THE BILL BE WRITTEN WE'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH SUPPORTING SO WE HAVE TO OPPOSE IT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. YES AND. THANK YOU MISTER. MEMBERS DON CAP HE ON THE- CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATIONS HIM TEARS UNFORTUNATELY AS STILL REMAINS OPPOSED. I'M AS YOU MAY BE AWARE SEEM TA REPRESENTS PACKAGING AND- A COMMODITY MANUFACTURERS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THIS BILL NOT ONLY PLASTICS BUT ALSO GLASS PAPER. A AND METAL CANS AS WELL AND CERTAINLY THE C. P. G. COMPANIES THAT THAT WOULD BE IN SCOPE. WE CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNED FOR THE REASONS THAT THE PRIOR SPEAKERS HAVE RAISED. ADDITIONALLY RAISE CONCERNS RELATED TO THE EMERGENCY RULE MAKING AUTHORITY FOR AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. A DE FEES STUDYING WHICH LEMONADE CIVILITY FOR MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT. A STAKEHOLDERS REGARDING THAT FEW SETTING. AS WELL AS OTHER CONCERNS AS NOTED ABOUT. FOR STRUCTURE HI BROAD SCOPE OF AUTHORITY. ADDITIONALLY ABILITY TO SET UP THE POP SCHEMES. AS WELL AS HAD VANCE DISPOSAL FEES WHAT HAVE YOU POTENTIALLY AS PART OF THE- SYSTEM. SO IT MUST REMAIN OPPOSED BUT APPRECIATE DONGLE. AND FOR THE CONTINUING THANK YOU. BY MISTER HEWITT ON BEHALF OF THE FOOD INDUSTRY WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS A SPECIFICALLY WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE LET ME OKAY JUST A PROCEDURAL THING FOR MY COMMITTEE. I MEAN I COULD I GUESS THE FOLKS WHO SPOKE IN SUPPORT OR SAID THEY'RE GOING OFF NEUTRAL DID NOT GIVE THE LONG RANGE OF REASONS AS TO WHY THEY- HADN'T THE VARIOUS ACCOMMODATIONS WE MADE INDUSTRY. SO AS TO MAKE THE BILL MORE PALATABLE I'M I'M HAPPY TO HAVE LIKE HERE EVERYONE'S KIND OF INDIVIDUAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL BUT THAT I COULD BE FAIR FOR US TO HAVE A MORE ROBUST. CONVERSATION ON THE PRO SIDE WHERE THE NEUTRAL SIDE TO KIND OF FULLY EXPLAIN. THE TYPICALLY PEOPLE JUST KIND OF VOICE OF IN OPPOSITION BUT I SO I JUST WANT TO KIND OF THROW OUT TO EVERYBODY. WHAT'S FAIR HERE BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE'LL GET IMPRESSED. WE'VE GOT ALL THIS IS CONCERNED. I'VE GOT A LITTLE A FULL PAGE OF FOLKS CAME OFF OF OPPOSITION BECAUSE IT. WE'VE AND HELP GET THEM THERE SO I JUST WANT TO KIND OF. I'M HAPPY FOR FOLKS TO RAISE A COUPLE CONCERNS BUT I LIKE TO KIND OF.

YEAH I KNOW HOW I LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. ALL I CAN SAY IS A- LOT OF WORK. THAT WENT INTO THIS BILL IS NOT A PERFECT BILL BUT- BUT CERTAINLY. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDRESS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE DEALING WITH AND ALTES. BILLING WITH A VARIETY OF OTHER ISSUES. THAT WE FEEL AS THOUGH. IT'S IN A GOOD ENOUGH SHAPE THAT WE WENT NEUTRAL ON THE BILL SO. FOR THAT THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK GOD. OF THE CHAIR AND- ASSEMBLYMEMBER I'LL GONZALEZ. AND NANCY'S SENATORS SKINNER'S OFFICE. IS OF THE WILL WORK VERY HARD TO GET TO THIS POINT VERY MUCH SO. WE GIVE YOU A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT CENTER SKINNER FOR A YEAR. YOU'RE VERY HARD WORK ON THIS YES. SOARING OR THE FAMILY WINE MAKERS OF CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU.

WITH THE AMERICA WITH THE ALLIANCE OF AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS OPPOSE. OKAY GREAT A LOT OF EXCITEMENT. NEW NEWS IN VARIOUS WAYS SO THIS MATTER I WILL I DO I DO WANT TO POINT OUT. TO HI MY FRIEND FROM THE US W. THE BILL DOES CALL FOR INCENTIVES IN IN IN FOR IN STATE MANUFACTURING AND A DIRECT KERR CYCLE DEVOID SHIPPING MATERIAL OUT OF THE COUNTRY. WE CAN CERTAINLY WORK TO AVOID IT I MEAN THE FACT THE MATTER IS THAT THE BILL. THE ULTIMATELY. WITH STRANGE TO ME IS THAT WE HAVE SOME FOLKS IN GLASS AND A CELL PUNCHED PEOPLE IN CLASS INDUSTRY OF COME ON. AND SUPPORTER OR NEUTRAL BUT IT IS. THREE THAT WE GOT SOME FOLKS WHO ARE RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT A POSSIBILITY DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT OUR PACKAGING MEETS THE SAME RATES AS GLASS. TOM I CONTINUE TO BELIEVE I'M OPTIMISTIC I THINK WE'RE GONNA KIND OF HELP TO. WORK WITH YOU AND EXPLAIN HOW WE'RE GONNA GET THERE BUT- YES AREA THIS IS THIS IS WHAT WE WANT. ALL RIGHT SO LET'S NOW OPEN THE FLOOR TO QUESTIONS CENTER SKINNER. CERTAINLY I WANT IT ENCOURAGE THEIR TO BE QUESTIONS INDISCRETIONS BUT I WANT TO MOVE THE BILL JUST BECAUSE THE ONE. WE GOT A SHORT TIME FOR IT TO GO BACK TO THE FLOOR. AND I WANT TO THANK MY STAFF AND EVERYBODY REALLY WORKED HARD ON THIS IS BEEN ENORMOUS. UNDERTAKING THE- CERTAINLY THE OPPOSITION CAN RAISE SOME ISSUES LOOK AND I DO NOT% QUESTION THEIR THEIR EITHER ISSUES OF THE MTIVATION BUT I THINK WHAT IS VERY WISE ABOUT THE BILL IS THAT IT ESTABLISHES ECONOMIC ADVISORY GROUP OF INDUSTRY WASTE HAULERS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHERS. IT DOES NOT TRY TO WRITE ALL THE RAGS WE DIDN'T TRY TO CROSS EVERY TEEN DOT EVERY ICE SO THAT WE CAN ALLOW THAT PROCESS MORE STAKEHOLDER TO FIGURE IT OUT THE END I THINK GIVEN WHO THE AUTHORS ARE. IN JUST THE NATURE OF OUR PROCESS THAT IF WE REALLY FIND THESE FATAL FLAWS THAT WILL AFFECT THESE IN WE WILL COME BACK AND FIX IT WE WILL SO ARE I'M JUST VERY VERY PROUD THAT WE ARE. WE HAVE THE HOPE OF MOVING THIS FORWARD GIVEN OUR CRISIS THAT WE'RE IN AND AS A COMMENT TO A WICKED WHO MADE THE SAID THE ORGANIZATION THAT THE NEW WAS NEWLY CREATED THAT THEY REPRESENT. AS AN ACTIVIST IN BERKELEY IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES WE USE CREATE MANY ORGANIZATIONS TO SUPPORT OR DIFFERENT EFFORTS AND AROUND OUR FOR THE VERY FIRST IN THE U. S. FIFTY FOR RECYCLING GOAL WE CREATED BEFORE BERKELEY FRIENDS OF RECYCLING. THE BERKELEY INTO AGAINST WASTE ALL KINDS WE HAD AT LEAST FIVE GROUPS WITH DIFFERENT A FEW DIFFERENT MEMBERS NEED TOWARD BUT ANYWAY SO IF YOU HAVE A WINDING IF ONLY FR THE FUNDING YOU KNOW. HAD WE COULD JUST EXPAND OR LIST OF HOSTED SUPPORT OF THINGS ALRIGHT THANK YOU MARCH THANK YOU VERY CENTER FOR YOU CENTER. OKAY QUESTION SIDE SO THERE ARE OTHER CONCERNS. I DO WANT TO THINK THAT THE AUTHOR FOR ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK AND THIS REALLY HAS BEEN SUCH A SUCH A GROUP EFFORT AND WE WOULD JUST EXTRAORDINARY STAFF ENGAGEMENT ON THIS AS WELL. YOU KNOW I WILL SAY IT IS PERSONALLY DISAPPOINTING THAT WHEN WE'VE HAD SUCH AND- SUCH A ROBUST PROCESS OVER THE SUMMER THAT AS THEY SAY HAS HAS GOTTEN. SO MUCH OPPOSITION OFF TO HAVE SOME FOLKS CAN COME UP. YOU KNOW RAISE CONCERNS SO LATE IN THE GAME BUT- YOU KNOW WE DO REMAIN REALLY COMMITTED TO WATER WHICH IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH EVERYBODY AND. AND SEEN SEEN FORGET THERE BECAUSE IN THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS. SUCH AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE. THE ISSUES KEEP GETTING WORSE THE BOTTOM LINE KEEPS GETTING MORE PROBLEMATIC BOTH FOR CITIES AND ALSO FOR COMPANIES. I AM WHO ANYONE INVOLVED IN WASTE MANAGEMENT AND SO ON. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS PHONE NUMBER. SO I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO THE REACTION TO SETTLE OKAY FIRST OF ALL. YOU CAN CALL ME BY MY FIRST NAME ANYTIME BUT IT'S LA RANNA NOT THE REYNARD ARENA. CHAMBER THE RETINA BUT ANNA IF YOU'RE NOT IN OUR THANK YOU. AND I'M SERIOUS ABOUT THAT AT MY THE FIRST NAME BUT LET'S GET RIGHT AT. I WOULD SAY THIS SOME OF THE THOUGHTS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP I DON'T DISAGREE RIGHT AND I KNOW THAT SENATOR SKINNER HAS TALKED ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE NEEDED ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE AND HAS SOME COMMITMENTS IN THE FUTURE THAT'S A THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM WE'VE GOT A CHICKEN AND EGG THING GOING ON HERE. AND WE KNOW THAT IN ORDER TO CREATE THE TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE NEED TO INVEST IN THAT INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE TO CREATE THE GOALS I MEAN IT AND WE'VE SEEN THAT THAT'S WHY WERE IN THIS SITUATION SO I DON'T WANT TO. I DON'T WANT TO SUGGEST THAT THAT WERE READY WE WILL BE READY THOUGH YES THE SECOND THING I WANT TO POINT OUT IS. IT TO THE STEEL WORKERS IF I THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE THAT THIS WAS GOING TO JEOPARDIZE GOOD UNION JOBS I WOULDN'T BE HERE I ACTUALLY THINK THAT EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BILL IS A REINVESTMENT OF GOOD UNION JOBS IN CALIFORNIA. A STATE WHERE WE NEED THEM AND IT'S NOT ONLY GLASS BECAUSE THE INCENTIVES TO MANUFACTURE HERE BUT ALSO IN RECYCLING IN THE ENTIRE CIRCULAR ECONOMY PROVIDES US OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY CREATE JOBS IN CALIFORNIA WHICH WE KNOW ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO BE UNION JOBS. AND IN FACT I THINK WILL ADD TO THAT THEIR GOOD PAYING UNION JOBS THAT'S PART OF WHY I AM COMMITTED TO THIS BILL SO I UNDERSTAND THE FEAR OF CHANGE AND THE FEAR OF LIKE WHAT. COULD HAPPEN OUT OF THIS BUT I DO WANT TO SAY. I WANT TO ENSURE THE WORKERS THAT. I DON'T SEE ANY ASPECT OF THIS THAT WILL COST GOOD UNION JOBS. AND THE GLASS IF IT'S KIND OF HARD TO SIT HERE WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT HOW THEY'RE COMPLETELY RECYCLABLE AND THAT THEY CAN'T SOMEHOW FIT INTO THIS. RECYCLABLE GOALS YOU KNOW SO I THINK I UNDERSTAND. THE CONCERN WE HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR AND WE'RE VERY CLEAR BY THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THIS HAS TO BE. MATERIAL NEUTRAL AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING I ALSO DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE. TOO MUCH OF A STRETCH FOR GLASS TO. TAKES HIT THE GOALS ESPECIALLY WITH THE DELAY TO TWENTY TWENTY SIX FROM THE- BARBELL. SO WITH THAT I AGES WHEN ADDRESS SMALL CONCERNS AND I RESPECT FELT WHY NOT SO OUR MANAGER ACTUALLY. ON OUR VICE CHAIR REQUESTED THAT WE HAVE THE CAD ACCOUNT RECYCLE COME IN AND JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THANK YOU IN MIND GEN THANK YOU I THANK YOU OUT HAT'S ALWAYS TROUBLED ME SERVING ON EQ. IT'S A GREAT COMMITTEE VERY CHALLENGING AND DOING GREAT THINGS AND THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING ABSOLUTELY NO. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO WHAT WE SEE GOING ON IN THE OP. THE RECYCLING WORLD BUT WHAT TROUBLES ME AS WE CERTAINLY DELEGATE TOO MUCH RESPONSIBILITY AND NOT ENOUGH. BUT FAVOR A ROLE FOR LEGISLATORS OUGHT TO OUR BUREAUCRACIES THAT'S ALWAYS MY PROBLEM IF IT COMES BACK TO US BECAUSE WE REPRESENT ALL THOSE PEOPLE OUT THERE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE. AND WERE ABLE TO KIND OF FIX THINGS THAT DON'T WORK SO NOTHING IN THIS BILL TELLS US HOW YOU ARE GOING TO ADDRESS THE INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES. THAT ARE CRRENTLY CAUSING THE CRISIS. ARE YOU NEED SO MANY MORE EMPLOYEES TO DO ALL THE F. IN A VERY SHORT TIME LINE SOLD. HELP US UNDERSTAND TO BEGIN WITH WE HAVE A FEW SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THERE'S A NEW FEET I UNDERSTAND. SO THERE'S NO STATUTORY LIMIT ON FEES AND I LIKE TO GO THERE FIRST BECAUSE EVERYTHING SOUNDS GREAT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IS COSTING. YOU KNOW GAZILLION DOLLARS AND THAT FALLS ON THE CONSUMERS AND ALL THE PRODUCERS SO. YOU KNOW THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE ARE MAJOR ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO HAVE SOME FRIENDS SOME BOOKENDS FROM YOU ON HOW YOU APPROACH THAT THAT HAPPENED WITH THE BE THIRTY TWO WHEN IT WENT TO. AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT AND THE I. A. R. B. THOSE ARE HUGE ISSUES WE'VE HELPED ARE GREATLY I THINK OVER THE COUPLE YEARS TO REIN IN SOME OF THAT BUT- I'LL START WITH THAT AND I. I'M SORRY OUR TIME IS SO LIMITED THAT LET'S LET YOU LEAST PUT IT ON THE TABLE BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO BE BACK HERE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE- LET'S SAY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE COMING. GOING TO COME OUT OF IMPLEMENTATION. OF SOMETHING THAT'S VERY COMPLEX AT THE MOMENT. THANK YOU I THANK YOU VERY MUCH I MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'M SCOTT SMITH LINE DIRECTOR OF COVER CYCLE MAYBE IF I COULD JUST START BY SAYING APPRECIATE MANY COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE HERE TODAY CERTAINLY THE APPROACH AS WE PERCEIVE IT THAT HAS BEEN WORKED WORKED OUT THROUGH THE LAST MONTH OF THIS BILL IS ONE THAT MAXIMIZES FLEXIBILITYOF COPLIANCE AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT TO THE DEPARTMENT THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS SOME OF THEM LATER IN THE PROCESS BUT SUBSTANTIVE NONE THE LESS THAT ADDRESS. PRODUCT SAFETY FOOD SAFETY THE MINIMUS AMOUNTS OF DIFFICULT TO HANDLE MATERIALS MATERIALS WITH UNIQUE CHALLENGES SMALL BUSINESS EXCEPTIONS OFFRAMP THE ABILITY FOR US TO FORM A WORKGROUP THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY GROUP THAT WILL MEET REGULARLY AND REPORT BACK AND MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD BE ADJUSTING AND THESE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IN THE BILL SO WE STRONG SUPPORT THAT APPROACH I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT SPECIFICALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE FEE THE FEE HAS A VERY SPECIFIC PERFECT PURPOSE AS OUTLINED HERE THE FEE IS TO COVER THE REASONABLE COST OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM SO THERE'S NO ABILITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT. TO RAISE A FEE TO SAVE STARTING TO INCENTIVE PROGRAM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT AND WE ARE GOVERNED BY THE REGULATORY PROP OBVIOUSLY AND ONE OF THE COMPOUND TôI PROCESS SOMEONE NAZARIAN WARNED US THAT THE BURDEN IS UPON THE DEPARTMENT TO DEVELOP REGULATIONS THAT ARE THE LEAST BURDENSOME AS POSSIBLE AND THAT'S THE STANDARD THAT. WERE HELD TO WHEN WE SUBMIT REGULATION THE WAY. SO THAT. APPLIED WAS WITH RESPECT THAT FEE AS WELL SO THERE IS NO CARD LAUNCH THERE IS NO WE CAN SET THE FEW WHEREVER WE WANT WE HAVE. DEVELOPED REGULATIONS THAT WILL. ACHIEVE THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE STATUTE THE GOAL THAT NEED TO BE MET. WE HAVE A PROCESS LAID OUT FOR OUR TO DO THAT INCLUDING AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. AND WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS. BUT ULTIMATELY THAT PEOPLE JUST TO BE COVERED THE REVIEWS REASONABLE. COST OF IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM. I KNOW I HOPE THAT. AB THOUGH THAT'S THAT'S THE LANGUAGE FROM PROP TWENTY SIX I MEAN THAT IS THE ROUTE THE REQUIREMENT ON IS JUST LITERALLY JUST. THE MINIMUM COST IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM. AND WE MUST DO SO IN IN THE MATTER THAT'S THE LEAST BURDENSOME AND THAT INCLUDES ATTEMPTING TO MINIMIZE THAT FEE. YEAH I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO WILL BE THE YOU TALK ABOUT STAKEHOLDERS WHO THAT THE TABLE. BECAUSE THE COSTS ARE DETERMINED BY THE PRODUCERS SO OFTEN THOSE AREN'T. LEGITIMATELY A ANALYZE WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT IT COSTS TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM FROM THE OTHER SIDE FROM THE BUREAUCRACY. SO THE BILL HAS TWO PRIMARY STAGES IF YOU WILL THERE IS AN EARLY STAGE WHERE THE DEPARTMENT WILL MEET REALLY NEED TO GET SOME THINGS IN PLACE SO WE WILL NEED TO DEVELOP SOME REPORTING REQUIREMENTS DEVELOP PACKAGING CATEGORIES DETECTOR THAT NEED TO BE DONE SO WE CAN GET. THE SORT OF THE LONGEST ON RAMP IF YOU WELL TO THE PRODUCERS HAVE RESPONSIBILITY INTO THE PROGRAM BUT THE MAIN REGULAR. WELL THROUGH AN EMPLOYER PLAN AND WE- TAYLOR THIS BILL REQUIRES US TO DEVELOP IN THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY WAYS POLLUTION REDUCTION PANEL ON THAT PANEL IS GOING TO BE SO IT'S LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WASTE MANAGEMENT. I'M FARMING GROUPS PRODUKTER PACKED ACTORS. DESIGNER AND RECITE AND THE BILL REQUIRES US TO DO IT IN A BALANCED WAY SO THAT WE MAKE SURE WE HAVE A BALANCED VOICE ON THAT PANEL AND THAT PANEL NOT ONLY. HELP US. DEVELOP THE REGULATE THAT ALSO. THAT WE EVERY EITHER BASIS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT DUSTING THOSE RECYCLING RATES THAT ARE REQUIRED IN THE BILL I HAVE TO SPEAK TO THE CHAIRMAN ON THIS ONE IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE COULD SEE A COMING BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE THOSE DRAFT REGULATIONS AND HOW THE BAND FORMED FORMATTED AND FORMULATED WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS BECAUSE THE ISSUES BROUGHT UP HERE TODAY DON'T THINK EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM IS REALLY ON THE SAME PAGE EVERYBODY WANTS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. OF THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO FEEL OUT THERE AN ANTENNA CONSERVE TO SPEAK SO MUCH OF IT IS KIND OF BIG MAYBE THE WORK IN PROGRESS ISSUE SO I'M GONNA WITHHOLD MY VOTE. TODAY ON ONE HEAR MORE ABOUT IT AND I KNOW OUR CHURCH AS WELL. ALLEGEDLY FROM THAT. WAS FIRST HEARD ON THIS SIDE TO TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE. BUT I THINK IT'S CRITICAL CERTAINLY FOR THE PRODUCERS AND THE CONSUMERS. THERE WE GET OUT OF. YOU KNOW A BETTER HANDLE. ON THE IMPACTS ON THE FACT THAT YOU WILL BE SUCCESSFUL SINCE WE'VE HAD. SO MANY ISSUES AND YOU ARE NOW ACTUALLY. YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO DO A HECK OF A LOT IN THE LAST TEN YEARS SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE AND I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A BETTER. RESPONSIBILITY IN TERMS OF THE WAITING PACKS CONSUMERS. AND PRODUCERS. I WILL SAY TO FIRST OF ALL I APPRECIATE THE VICE CHAIRS COMMENTS ON THERE ARE VERY STRINGENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING RIGHT AFTER THE PLAN. AND I YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT I THINK IT'S BEGUN TO HAVE EVERYONE THE COMMITTEE. AND I'M SURE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE THAT THERE WILL BE A OF X. A LOT OF INTEREST IN. MAINTAINING STRICT OVERSIGHT OVER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS. OF THIS BILL IF IT IF IT PASSES AND. THERE WILL BE THEY'LL BE A LOT OF. PLACE FOR LEGISLATIVE HE GAVE ME SAY THIS TERMINALIA. CERTAINLY FOR ASSEMBLY. WHEN YOU SEE BY LORRAINE. REYNA YOU YOU BOTH HAVE BEEN VERY OPEN TO THE PEOPLE TRIPS TRAIPSING THROUGH YOUR OFFICE AND THREE ALIVE SALAS. THIS WAY INTRODUCE BUT OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU TAKE ON SOMETHING OF THIS MAGNITUDE IN THIS HUGE IMPACT ARE THAT THAT SOMETHING THAT YEAH THAT THAT'S A CHALLENGE BUT THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT WE ASK FOR IT. YEAH BUT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE I MEAN WE WERE VERY CONCERNED I-THINK ABOUT THAT AT TO YOU AT THE OUTSET. AFTER YOU WERE THE NEW DATA SAID YOU KNOW HOW MANY ITEMS ARE MADE FOR NEW BABIES MATTER A MAJOR PRODUCTS THAT WOULD BE OUTLAWED WITH THIS PARTICULAR BILL AND HE SAID YEAH FULL THERE'S AN AWARENESS AND AWAKENING THERE BUT MORE USED TO BE DONE. YEAH THE WE SAY YEAH AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I WILL SAY YOU KNOW WE HAVE LANGUAGE ABOUT HEALTH AND SAFETY. MAKING SURE THAT THE- THERE'D BE ABSOLUTE NO. BE A COMPROMISE ON HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS IN ADDITION IT'S IMPOSSIBILITY AND IF THERE'S LITTLE A PRODUCT THAT'S- IT IS NOT A- VIABLE ALTERNATIVE. AND THEN WE ALSO DO THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW EXCEPT INFANT. FORMULA PACKAGING AND OTHER THINGS ON THOSE LINES. I WILL SAY ON THIS FEE ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THAT. THE GLASS FOLKS WHO HAVE DROPPED THEIR OPPOSITION WERE SO ANXIOUS TO DO WE- MAKE A KEY CHANGE WHICH WAS TO. IF YOU'RE IN THE BOTTLE BILL. IF YOU'RE THE CRP PROGRAM AND YOU WERE MEETING YOUR RATES YOU ARE EXEMPTED FROM THIS BILL. TWENTY TWENTY SIX. I AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY WERE NERVOUS THAT THEY WOULD BE YEAH DOUBLE CHARGED EFFECTIVELY FOR. THE UC OUR P. AND FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD OUT OF SB FIFTY FOUR TEN EIGHTY TEN EIGHTY.
