I WAS COMPLETELY AGAINST IT AND

00:59:08.077 --> 00:59:08.745
THOUGHT HE WAS CRAZY.

00:59:08.811 --> 00:59:09.712
TURNER COLLEGES THAT THERE IS

00:59:09.779 --> 00:59:12.515
NOTHING REALLY LEFT TO DO AND SO

00:59:12.582 --> 00:59:13.516
TO GO AHEAD AND GIVE IT A TRY.

00:59:13.583 --> 00:59:14.517
WHEN WE STARTED IT TOOK A COUPLE

00:59:14.584 --> 00:59:15.685

SEIZURES LEFT IN HIS EEGS OUR

00:59:18.888 --> 00:59:19.822
BRAIN WAVE PATTERNS STARTED

00:59:19.889 --> 00:59:21.557
IMPROVING?

00:59:21.624 --> 00:59:22.825
PRETTY QUICKLY THEREAFTER.

00:59:22.892 --> 00:59:24.661
HE'S NOW IN KINDERGARTEN HE JUST

00:59:24.727 --> 00:59:25.929
FINISHED HIS FIRST YEAR OF

00:59:25.995 --> 00:59:27.297
KINDERGARTEN -- THAT KID WHO

00:59:27.363 --> 00:59:28.564
SAID THEY WERE HE WOULD NEVER

00:59:28.631 --> 00:59:30.199
WALK OR TALK IS LEARNING TO

00:59:30.266 --> 00:59:31.768
WRITE HE CAN SPELL HIS NAME.

00:59:31.834 --> 00:59:33.069
HE'S SPEAKING.

00:59:33.136 --> 00:59:34.170
BUT THE MEDICATION THAT SAVED

00:59:34.237 --> 00:59:36.105
HIM THAT IS NOT ALLOW HIM TO DO

00:59:36.172 --> 00:59:36.839
ALL THESE THINGS.

00:59:36.906 --> 00:59:38.174
IS NOW FORCING HIM OUT OFTHE

00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:40.977
CLASSROOM BECAUSE OF OUTDATED

00:59:41.044 --> 00:59:43.446
INFORMATION -- THIS YEAR YOU HAD

00:59:43.513 --> 00:59:44.047
A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS OF

00:59:44.113 --> 00:59:44.280
SCHOOL.

00:59:44.347 --> 00:59:44.914
EVERY DAY WE GO TO SCHOOL TO

00:59:44.981 --> 00:59:46.482
PULL HIM OUT OF CLASS WALKING A

00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:47.350
THOUSAND FEET OFF CAMPUS AND

00:59:47.417 --> 00:59:48.851
GIVE HIM HIS MEDICATION AND

00:59:48.918 --> 00:59:49.819
BRING HIM BACK TO SCHOOL.

00:59:49.886 --> 00:59:51.955
DICKS IS ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES ON

00:59:52.021 --> 00:59:52.689
A GOOD DAY.

00:59:52.755 --> 00:59:54.590
THAT TIME IS 10% OF HIS TOTAL

00:59:54.657 --> 00:59:57.260
SCHOOL DAY AND IS EQUAL TO FIVE

00:59:57.327 --> 00:59:58.328
THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED MINUTES OR

00:59:58.394 --> 01:00:00.563
NINETY HOURS OF SCHOOL TIME.

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:01.497
THAT WAS JUST HIS KINDERGARTEN

01:00:01.564 --> 01:00:03.199
YEAR BY THE TIME YOU GRADUATE

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:06.436
HIGH SCHOOL HE WILL LOSE ONE

01:00:06.502 --> 01:00:07.003
THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:07.670
THREE AND A HALF HOURS OF SCHOOL.

01:00:07.737 --> 01:00:11.140
OR SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND SIX

01:00:11.207 --> 01:00:11.674
HUNDRED AND TEN MINUTES OF

01:00:11.741 --> 01:00:12.041
EDUCATION TIME.

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:13.076
WHAT ELSE COULD HE HAVE LEARNED

01:00:13.142 --> 01:00:14.043
DURING THAT TIME?

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:15.278
I THINK HE WOULD PROBABLY BE

01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:16.679
ABLE TO WRITE THE WHOLE ALPHABET

01:00:16.746 --> 01:00:18.047
NOT JUST HIS NAME.

01:00:18.114 --> 01:00:18.948
I HAVEN'T EVEN ADDRESSED THE

01:37:44.225 --> 01:37:44.491
MY HOUSEHOLD.

01:37:44.558 --> 01:37:46.594
SO FOR ME WHEN I THINK OF MY

01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:48.429
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HAVING HAD

01:37:48.495 --> 01:37:49.530
SOMETHING.

01:37:49.597 --> 01:37:52.633
AT AND MY HANDS TO TO REACH OUT --

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:54.235
TO FOR SUPPORT WOULD HAVE BEEN.

01:37:54.301 --> 01:37:55.703
HELPFUL HAD I NEEDED IT AT THE

01:37:55.769 --> 01:37:57.905
TIME BUT AS IT PERTAINS TO WHAT

01:37:57.972 --> 01:37:59.707
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO NUMBERS

01:37:59.773 --> 01:38:01.642
ON A CARD -- DOESN'T SEEM LIKE

01:38:01.709 --> 01:38:03.043
MUCH I CAN I CAN SEE YOUR

01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:04.912
CONCERN ABOUT FUTURE ADDING TO

01:38:04.979 --> 01:38:08.182
THIS CARD BUT TWO NUMBERS TO ME --

01:38:08.249 --> 01:38:15.356
IF IT HELPS SAVE A YOUNG LADY.

01:38:15.422 --> 01:38:16.357
FROM FALLING VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC

01:38:16.423 --> 01:38:17.458
VIOLENCE I THINK IT'S IT'S

01:38:17.524 --> 01:38:18.092
DETRIMENTAL I MEAN I THINK WE

01:38:18.158 --> 01:38:18.759
NEED TO HAVE IT THERE AND I HAVE

01:38:18.826 --> 01:38:19.460
CONSIDERED I JUST THINK THAT

01:38:19.526 --> 01:38:19.960
THAT WOULD BE UP TO THE

01:38:20.027 --> 01:38:20.594
LEGISLATURE THEY CONTINUED OUT

01:38:20.661 --> 01:38:21.695
NUMBERS BUT RIGHT NOW TO NUMBERS.

01:38:21.762 --> 01:38:23.631
TO VERY CRITICAL NUMBER A

01:38:23.697 --> 01:38:25.432
SUICIDE AS I'VE SEEN THAT ALSO

01:38:25.499 --> 01:38:27.768
MY SCHOOLS AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:38:27.835 --> 01:38:29.903
TEENAGE DATING VIOLENCE IS ALSO

01:38:29.970 --> 01:38:31.238
IMPORTANT SO.

01:38:31.305 --> 01:38:32.473
I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

01:38:32.539 --> 01:38:33.507
BUT THAT WOULD BE UP TO THE

01:38:33.574 --> 01:38:34.308
LEGISLATURE THEY WANT TO KEEP

01:38:34.375 --> 01:38:35.209
THAT AND I THINK THOSE TWO

01:38:35.276 --> 01:38:37.878
NUMBERS VISUALLY ARE PERFECT AND

01:38:37.945 --> 01:38:39.346
WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE.

01:38:39.413 --> 01:38:41.081
I'VE HEARD PEOPLE ASK ABOUT SEX

01:38:41.148 --> 01:38:42.716
TRAFFICKING AS WELL IN TERMS OF

01:38:42.783 --> 01:38:45.019
A NUMBER FOR THAT -- AND AND I

01:38:45.085 --> 01:38:46.620
KNOW THAT'S A MAJOR ISSUE IN

01:38:46.687 --> 01:38:48.989
CHALLENGE -- IN LOTS OF SCHOOLS

01:38:49.056 --> 01:38:50.357
AND COMMUNITIES THAT THERE AND

01:38:50.424 --> 01:38:52.026
AND JUST IS EQUALLY AS DANGEROUS

01:38:52.092 --> 01:38:53.594
IN TERMS OF THE DAMAGE YOU CAN

01:38:53.661 --> 01:38:54.895
DO TO YOUNG PEOPLE SO.

01:38:54.962 --> 01:38:56.530
YOU KNOW I I'VE I'VE HEARD FOLKS

01:38:56.597 --> 01:38:58.198
ASK AND SO I I I I'M SUPPORTIVE

01:38:58.265 --> 01:39:00.668
OF THIS BUT I AM CONCERNED.

01:39:00.734 --> 01:39:01.935
AND I THINK AS THE LEGISLATURE

01:39:02.002 --> 01:39:03.170
AT SOME POINT WE'RE GOING TO

01:39:03.237 --> 01:39:04.805
HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT -- WITH

01:39:04.872 --> 01:39:06.473
REGARDS TO WHAT REALLY GOES ON

01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:07.908
THE BACK OF THOSE CARS OR BETTER

01:39:07.975 --> 01:39:08.909
WAY OF DEALING WITH IT OR

01:39:08.976 --> 01:39:10.144
SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW.

01:39:10.210 --> 01:39:11.712
I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER BUT I AM

01:39:11.779 --> 01:39:14.748
CONCERNED BECAUSE I DO WANT --

01:39:14.815 --> 01:39:15.683
TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER

01:39:15.749 --> 01:39:17.451
NUMBERS WE PUT ON THERE REALLY

01:39:17.518 --> 01:39:21.121
ARE FUNCTIONAL AND SO WE DON'T

01:39:21.188 --> 01:39:22.690
HAVE SO MANY THAT.

01:39:22.756 --> 01:39:23.490
THEY BECOME MEANINGLESS IN TERMS

01:39:23.557 --> 01:39:24.191
OF EITHER THE SIZE OF THE

01:39:24.258 --> 01:39:26.160
IMPORTANCE OF FOLKS USING IT I

01:39:26.226 --> 01:39:28.395
THINK THAT'S THE CONCERN I

01:39:28.462 --> 01:39:28.662
EXPRESS.

01:39:28.729 --> 01:39:29.763
WE'VE GOT THIS.

01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:31.198
BUT ONE WAY ONE LAST YEAR NOW WE

01:39:31.265 --> 01:39:32.533
HAVE A PRETTY WE HAVE ANOTHER

01:39:32.599 --> 01:39:32.966
BILL WORKING THROUGH

01:39:33.033 --> 01:39:34.535
LEGISLATURE'S TWO RIGHT AND NEXT

01:39:36.437 --> 01:39:36.970
ELSE PROBABLY RIGHT.

01:39:37.037 --> 01:39:39.907
SO -- THAT I THINK IS A REAL

01:39:39.973 --> 01:39:42.042
CONCERN YEAH BUT BUT WE WERE

01:39:42.109 --> 01:39:43.344
