AND FINALLY AN UPDATE ON OUR CLAIM PROCESSING A NUMBER OF ACTIONS- THAT WE HAVE TAKEN AND ARE GETTING READY TO TAKE- AS WELL AS GIVE YOU A QUICK UPDATE ON THE LOST WAGES ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. OF THE BEFORE I START I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW WHO IS HERE WITH ME TODAY FIRST OF ALL I HAVE- CAROL WILLIAMS SHE IS. THE BRAND NEW CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OVER OPERATIONS AT THE GOVERNOR KNEW SOME RECENTLY APPOINTED. TODAY AS HER FIRST DAY AND I HAVE TO SAY NO ONE'S MORE EXCITED TO HAVE HER HERE THAN I AM- I WANT TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO GOVERNOR NEWSOM ONCE AGAIN FOR BRINGING IN- A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WHETHER IT'S ALL THE APPOINTEES. OR IS THE STRIKE TEAM SO WELCOMED AND SO NEEDED AND THANK YOU. I ALSO HAVE WITH ME MICHELLE CERTAIN RATES SHE IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BRANCH AND BETWEEN US- ANY QUESTIONS THAT COME UP WILL BE GLAD TO FEEL THEM. AND IF WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER WILL CERTAINLY GET BACK TO ALL OF YOU. SO WITH THAT- I PROVIDED THE COMMITTEE THIS MORNING A PACKET OF INFORMATION. OF CHARTS I THOUGHT I WOULD PROBABLY BE THE BEST WAY SO I CAN UPDATE YOU AND YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE. WHAT WE'RE DOING THE SPECIFIC NUMBERS AND THEN YOU LOOK AT THE YOU HAD IT MOVING FORWARD. YOU KNOW IN FULL TRANSPARENCY WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAD EVERYTHING. SO I'M GONNA START AND WALK THROUGH THESE JERKS- THE FIRST ONE IS THE HIRING STAFF DETAILS IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. THIS IS THE STAFF% REPRESENTED IN MONTHLY THAT HAVE COMPLETED TRAINING AND PRODUCTIVE SO WE'VE DISPLAYED THE NUMBERS WHEN THEY'RE ACTUALLY PRODUCTIVE NOT WHEN WE HIRED THEM. TO GIVE YOU A SENSE WE'RE WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF FINISHING UP HIRING ABOUT FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED. ORIGINALLY WAS LOOKING AT FIFTY THREE HUNDRED- I RECENTLY UPPED IT TO FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED TO- ADD MORE RESOURCES IN THE WORK YOUR PROGRAM- ALSO THOUGH I AM GOING TO CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE LEVEL RESOURCES AND WE MAY VERY WELL AND I EXPECT. THAT WE'LL BE DOING EVEN ADDITIONAL HIRING BUT ON THE FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED- THE WORKLOAD WARRANTS IT I BELIEVE AND- WE JUST NEED TO CONTINUE AND TAKE A LOOK AT IT WHICH WERE CREDITED TO. SO I SPLIT. THE CHART INTO TWO BOXES THE FIRST ONE- REALLY FOCUSES ON THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CALL CENTER STAFFING. AS YOU KNOW THERE'S TWO LINES THERE'S A YOU AYE SUPPORT CLAIM SUPPORT WHICH IS OPEN FROM EIGHT TO TWELVE AND THERE'S A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LINE IS OPEN FROM EIGHT TO EIGHT. PANDEMIC WE HAD ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE AND ARE YOU AYE CLAIMS SUPPORT- OUTLINE. A WE DIDN'T HAVE THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT LINE THAT CAME AFTER THE PANDEMIC- SOMETHING WE SET UP QUICKLY IN A BRICK ON A VIRTUAL PLATFORM. UP WHEN THE PANDEMIC CAT BECAUSE IT WAS A TIDAL WAVE BEYOND TIDAL WAVE OF WORKLOAD. WE REDIRECTED TO LEARN FIFTY OF THOSE STAFF- TO DO CLAIM PROCESSING BECAUSE WE YOU KNOW WE NEEDED TO MAKE PAYMENTS I LEFT A HUNDRED PEOPLE ON THE PHONE. BUT WE CLEARLY RECOGNIZE AND ARE THERE NOT ENOUGH NOT ENOUGH TO FOR. CLEARLY NOT ENOUGH TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT CALIFORNIA SO DESPERATELY NEEDS. ALL AND THAT IS WHY WE ADDED THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LINE- IN APRIL AND STAFFED IT WITH- SOME REDIRECTED YOU AYE STAFF ASWELL AS- TAFF FROM OTHER PROGRAMS. AND ALSO CONTRACTED WITH DELOITTE TO BRING ON AGENTS QUICKLY- SO WE COULD SCALE UP AS A TEMPORARY MEASURE. AND THEN PROVIDED OF DIFFERENT WHAT ABOUT TRAINING SEVERAL TRAININGS INFORMATION MENTORS THE WORKS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN MAKE THEM AS PRODUCTIVE AND HELPFUL AS POSSIBLE. FROM THERE YOU CAN SEE WE OF BIG WE STARTED HIRING AND TRAINING ACTIVELY EACH MONTH WE'VE BEEN. ADDING MORE AND MORE PEOPLE AND JULY FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY ONE AUGUST SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE. OF SIX HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR AND NOT KNOW THOUSAND OCTOBER IF YOU CAN SEE. IN OCTOBER- WE WILL BE COMBINING OUR TO CALL CENTERS. UP TO CALL LINES INTO ONE CALL CENTER WHICH I'M EXCITED ABOUT SO ALL THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED FOLKS WILL BE IN THE ONE CALL CENTER AND FOURTEEN HUNDRED OF THE FOLKS WILL BE OFFICE TECHNICIANS THAT PROVIDE GENERAL ASSISTANCE- YOU KNOW CLUB- CLAIM UPDATE A PASSWORD CHANGES- GENERAL INFORMATION. AND THEN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM REPRESENTATIVES TO WORK ON THE MORE SPECIFIC COMPLEX CASES WE CLEARLY SEE WE NEEDED A HIGHER RATIO OF PROFESSIONAL STAFF THAT CAN GET INTO THE MORE COMPLEX ISSUES. GIVEN WITH THE CARERS ACT- THE PROGRAMS ARE SO COMPLEX AND WE NEEDED TO MAKE SURE WE PUT ENOUGH RESOURCES IN THAT THAT HIGHER LEVEL. WE ALSO WILL HAVE- FIVE HUNDRED LOIT AGENTS THAT WILL PROVIDE. SOME GENERAL INFORMATION AS WELL RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THEM ON CONTRACT THROUGH THE END OF THE YEAR AND- IF WE DETERMINED THAT- WE'RE IN A GOOD PLACE FOR AS FAR AS OUR RESPONSETHAT AND WE'RE LOOKING TO- NOT RENEW THE CONTRACT- BUT I WANT TO KEEP THAT OPTION OPEN AND- LIKE I SAID IT WILL BE ASSESSING EVERY MONTH THE MAIN THING I WHAT THE WORK. YET PROVIDING THE SERVICE AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A GOOD FOUNDATION BEFORE WE DISCONTINUED THAT THAT SERVE THAT CONTRACT. SO THAT'S THE BECAUSE CENTER BOX. THE NEXT BOX BREAKS DOWN ALL OF OUR WORK FUNCTIONS- BY WORK FUNCTION SO YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY- WHAT WE WORK STARTED WITH THEN- WHERE ARE NOW. FOR EXAMPLE ON THE CALL CENTERS LIKE I SAID WE STARTED AT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY OUT WE WILL BE ENDING AT THE END OF THE YEAR WITH THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE. AND I DO EXPECT THAT WE'RE GOING TO ADD EEN DIGITAL RESOURCES IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA I'M GONNA BE WATCHING THE CALL METRICS. AND BASED ON THE RESPONSE LOW RESPONSE WE MAY BE ADDING MORE SO MORE TO COME ON THAT. CLAIM FILING YOU'LL SEE WE STARTED AT FIVE HUNDRED FORTY SIX. AND WE'RE NOW TO ALMOST WILL BE ALMOST AT TWO THOUSAND A CLAIMSFILER'S IDENTITY WE STARTED WITH TWENTY AND WE'RE GONNA END UP WITH FIVE HUNDRED AND THREE PEOPLE. A ELIGIBLE ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS WE STARTED AT FOUR SIXTY AND WE'RE- GOING TO END UP WITH THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE OF THAT WENT DOWN BECAUSE OF THE FLEXIBILITY THAT WE HAVE BEEN UTILIZING THAT WE'RE SO WE'VE BEEN DOING LAST DETERMINATIONS TO HELP CLAIMS GO THROUGH. QUICKLY UP RECALLS- WE START WITH FORTY TO GO AND I WERE AT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN I WILL TELL YOU ALSO WE HAVE TURNED THE CORNER ON RECALLS WE ARE NOW PRODUCING ABOUT 35% MORE THAN- WHAT WAS RECEIVING WHICH IS GREAT WE THOUGHT YOU KNOW OF ALL THE TRAINING AND- THAT SCALING AND GETTING PEOPLE- MORE PEOPLE HIRED- WE'VE CLEARLY COULD CLEAR UP TURNED A CORNER SO WE CAN. AGGRESSIVELY IT WORK INTO OUR OLDER CASES AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BEING RESPONSIVE SO VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT WORK SHARE RESTORED WITH FIFTY ONE AND WE'RE NOW IT TOO CAN BE AT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY ONE. AND AN OVERPAYMENT APPEAL SAID ABOUT THE SAME AT THIS. OR NOT FOCUSING ON OVER PAYMENTS AT THIS AT THIS MOMENT AND WE'RE FOCUSING ON GETTING PEOPLE PAID WE ALSO HAD SIX HUNDRED FORTY NINE- REDIRECTED STAFF- THAT WORK ON SOME OF THE- CLAIMS FILING AND CONTINUE CLAIM SUPPORT. DOING SOME OF THE LESS COMPLEX WORK WE HAVE A IN THOSE AREAS. SO THOSE STAFF WILL BEGIN TO TRANSFER BACK TO THEIR PROGRAMS OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER- AS YOU KNOW AS WE CAN THE OTHER PROGRAMS OF IT THEN EXTRAORDINARILY IN A GREAT PARTNERSHIP WITH YOU I PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE WE CAN DO EVERYTHING BY THE U. I- AND OUR-CUSTOMERS SO AS WE CAN WITH WHAT WE WILL- BE PEELING PEOPLE OFTEN SO THEY CAN RETURN AND GET CONTINUE TO HIRE IN THE YOUR PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING. THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN. SO THAT'S HIRING STAFF DETAILS I HOPE THAT GIVES YOU A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WHERE WE'RE GOING AND- AND ALL THE NUMBERS AND- OF COURSE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. THE NEXT CHART IS ON CALL CENTER DATA. ARE YOU HAD ASKED ABOUT THIS LAST TIME SO I WANTED TO GIVE YOU AN ACTUAL PICTURE AND SPECIFICS ON OUR CALL CENTER DATA AND THE DATA IS FOR BOTH LINES IT'S A COMBINATION OF BOTH LINES AN IF YOU LOOK AT THE CHART. UP CALLS ANSWERED THE BLUE LINE IS CALLED THE CALLS THAT WE ANSWERED IN OUR ON OUR CALL LINE. AND THE GOLD LINE IS THE UNIQUE COLORS THE NUMBER OF CALLERS THAT ACTUALLY- CALLER CALL CENTER- IF THE INDIVIDUALS VERSUS HOW MANY TIMES THEY CALLED- YOU KNOW WE TRACK IT BY THAT THE INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ACTUALLY SERVICING- BUT WE- TOTALLY RECOGNIZE THAT THEY'RE CALLING. THREE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT YOU KNOW TIMES. UP REPEAT DIALING SO BUT- ALSO THEN THE PERCENTAGE OF CALLS ANSWERED SO PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC WE WERE ANSWERING ABOUT 54% OF THAT THE CLAIMS OF- AT CALLS BY UNIQUE COLORS. AND YOU CAN SEE ONCE THE PANDEMIC HIT WE TOOK A NOSE DIVE DOWN 2408% 8% 3% TO PERCENT- IT THE TIDAL WAVE WAS YOU KNOW JUST TOOK US OUT AND BUT- WITH ALL THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AND ON THE STAFF RESOURCES AND WORKING ON A CALL CENTER- YOU CAN SEE OVER THE MONTHS WE HAVE BEEN IMPROVING EVERY SINGLE MONTH. WENT 21720% 27% 32% IN LAST WEEK WERE AT 40% AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO CLIMB UP AND I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. I'M NOT SURE I WOULD LOVE YOUR INPUT ON WHERE WE PROBABLY SHOULD ULTIMATELY LAMP AN INDUSTRY STANDARD USUALLY UP FOR CALL CENTERS YOU WANNA ANSWER ABOUT 80% OF YOUR CALLS- AND STAFF IT THAT WAY BUT THAT THAT MAY STILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT BECAUSE IT ENDED THEY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE WE'RE DRESSING EVERYBODY'S NEEDS SO I WOULD LOVE. YOUR INPUT AND FEEDBACK ON THAT TOTAL COSTS IT'S NOT ON THE SERVER JUST SO YOU HAVE IN CASE YOU'RE INTERESTED. IN JULY A OR EXCUSE ME IN MARCH APRIL WE WERE LIKE AT. FOURTEEN MILLION CALLS A WEEK. BY JUNE WE ARE COMING DOWN ABOUT ELEVEN MILLION CALLS A WEEK AND MOST RECENTLY WERE AT SIX POINT SEVEN MILLION CALLS A WEEK. SO IT DEFINITELY IS- COMING UP COMING DOWN- SO JULY WAS SIX POINT SEVEN MILLION AND THEN MOST RECENTLY FIVE POINT ONE MILLION PER WEEK SO- SO THAT SO MAKING PROGRESS THERE ON THE CALLS ARE COMING DOWN. SO THAT'S IT FOR THE CALL CENTER BEGAN. WITH A QUESTION ABOUT THAT WE- OPEN IT UP. THE NEXT SLIDE IS FIRST PAYMENT PROMPTNESS- WE PROVIDED OR I PROVIDED THIS METRIC THE LAST TIME I IN MY MEMO TO YOU OR TO- SECRETARY SUIT THAT SHE PROVIDED SO I WANTED TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON THAT AS WELL. THE FIRST AREA I THAT I'M FOR ALL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CLAIMS TYPE- I DID PROVIDE THIS LAST TIME BUT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED. BECAUSE THIS GIVES THE- FIRST PAYMENT PROMPTNESS FOR REGULAR YOU LIFE YOU WAY IF YOU SEE AN FED AT ALL OF THEM. THE ONE I PROVIDED LAST TIME ONLY SPOKE TO THE U. I. PROGRAM. SO AS OF JULY THIRTY FIRST 75% OF CLAIMANTS HAVE RECEIVED THEIR FIRST PAYMENT WITHIN TWENTY ONE DAYS FROM THE TIME THEY SUBMITTED THEIR YOU EYE ON LINE APPLICATION. JUST SO YOU HAVE THAT DATA. NOW THE OTHER MEASUREMENT THE REGULAR REGULAR ON. INSURANCE THAT IS WHAT- IS REQUIRED BY DEAL WELL THAT'S OUR MEASUREMENT AND WHAT THEY REQUIREMENT REQUIRES STATES TO PAY 87% OF ALL FIRST PAYMENTS ON A REGULAR YOU AYE CLAIM WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS OF THE FIRST PAGE OF A WEEK. ENDING DATE. WHEN THERE'S A WEEK WAITING PERIOD OR WITHIN TWENTY ONE DAYS WHEN THERE'S NO WAITING PERIOD. WE DON'T HAVE A WAITING PERIOD BUT WE STILL- PROVIDE DATA AND LOOK AT THESE MEASURES FOR BOTH FOURTEEN AND TWENTY ONE. M. LAST TIME I PROVIDED YOU THE DATE IT WAS THROUGH JUNE I'VE NOW ADDED TO LIVE JUST RECENTLY CAME OUT. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT- EDIE'S FIRST PAYMENT PROMPTNESS- WENT UP- IN JULY TWO SIXTY POINT EIGHT- AND THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IS SIX SIXTY POINT. SO ABOUT THE NATIONAL AVERAGE NOT NOT MUCH BUT IT WILL BUT DEFINITELY IMPROVED FROM LAST MONTH AGAIN A DIRECT RESULT OF ALL OUR HIRES. AND GETTING THAN THAT DESPERATELY NEEDED RESOURCES ON BOARD. AND THEN FOR THE TWENTY ONE DAY MEASURE- WE'RE AT SEVENTY TWO POINT SEVEN WHICH WAS AN INCREASE FROM JUNE WHICH WAS SIXTY FIVE POINT ONE PERCENT- AND THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF SIXTY SEVEN POINT USE OR- ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE THEIR TO. SO GOOD NEWS I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU. WE CAN DO BETTER BUT IT'S A GOOD STARTING WE'RE DEFINITELY SHOWING PROGRESS. OKAY. THE NEXT CHART IS THE CURRENT% STATUS OF CLAIMING DATA AS REPORTED OF JULY TWENTY THIRD ONE- IN MY MEMO- I- PROVIDED YOU A DATA BY ALL THESE DIFFERENT WORK STREAMS OUT OF SEVEN TWENTY THREE SO THAT'S WITHOUT A SECOND COLUMN IS THAT REPEATED THE DATED I PROVIDED YOU AGAIN BEFORE SO YOU CAN- USE THAT AS A BASELINE AND THEN SHOW. YOU CAN SHOW WHERE WE ARE TODAY. OF THE STATUS OF AS OF EIGHT TWENTY. THAT WHAT'S BEEN PAID INCREASED- TO FOUR POINT NINE WHICH WAS AN INCREASE OF TWO AND IT'S NOW ONE POINT OH ONE WHICH IS A DECREASE OF 16% IN ELIGIBLE WAS ONE SIXTY ONE POINT SEVEN AND- AS OF EIGHT TWENTY ONE SIXTY FOUR. THOUSAND WHICH IS- AN INCREASE OF 1% AND THEN. MAYBE ELIGIBLE WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION- IT WAS EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND AND WAS REDUCED TO FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND WHICH IS VERY GOOD NEWS AND IF I BREAK OUT THAT DOWN FURTHER. THOSE THAT HAVE NOT CERTIFIED FOR BENEFITS THE FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN IS NOW DOWN TO TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND. WHICH IS A DECREASE OF 61% I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW WE STARTED SENDING OUT REMINDER EMAILS AND ENHANCE OUR COMMUNICATIONS- TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY NEEDED TO GO AND CERTIFIED. IN IN ORDER TO- RECEIVE PAYMENT SO CLEARLY THE EMAILS ARE ARE HOT HAPPENING IN HELPING. ALSO FOR THE FOR THE FOLKS THAT DID NOT PROVIDE WAIT INFORMATION TO QUALIFY FOR A CLAIM- WE WERE AT THREE HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND AND NOW WE'RE DOWN TO TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN. SO AGAIN I THINK THAT ENHANCE COMMUNICATIONS IS DEFINITELY SHOW I'M SHOWING RESULTS AND IT WAS THERE WAS A DECREASE OF TWENTY TWO PERCENT. SO I'M VERY VERY HAPPY TO SEE THAT. AND THEN- ON THE PEN THE WORK ITEMS THAT WE- I HAVE HAD AND- AND OUR BUCKET. OF THE PENDING EIGHTY RESOLUTION OR IS TWO HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND. WE ARE NOW DOWN TO EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND. AND FOUR HUNDRED AND THAT'S A MINUS THE MARCH THROUGH JUNE- WORKLOADS WE ARE ON PACE TO HAVE THEM DONE BY THE END OF SEPTEMBER AND- SO- PERCENTAGE WISE WE HAVE COMPLETED ABOUT EIGHTY TWO PERCENT. OF THAT WORKLOAD. NOW pAN INCREASE OF TWO HUNDRED NINETY SIX. SO ASK PEOPLE STARTED CERTIFYING AND PROVIDING US INFORMATION- THAT MOVED TO DIFFERENT BUCKETS WHETHER IT WAS UNPAID PAIN IN ELIGIBLE OR- ACTIONS THAT WE NEEDED TO TAKE. SO OF COURSE YOU KNOW EVERY DAY IS A- IT'S GONNA HAVE A DIFFERENT INVENTORY BUT- IT THIS MEANS THAT THEY TOOK ACTION AND NOW WE NEED TO TAKE OUR ACTION IN ORDER TO ON THOSE ALONG AND GET THEM PAID. SO THAT INCREASE THEIR- LET'S SEE ANYTHING ELSE I WANTED TO SAY. OKAY GO TO THE NEXT YEAR. SO THIS CHART IS ALL THE ACTIONS THAT WE'VE COMPLETED AND THE TURKS AFTER THAT ARE THINGS THAT ARE UNDER WAY. THE FIRST ONE- WAS IT- IF YOU MAY REMEMBER WE RELAXED ELIGIBILITY CONDITIONS SUCH AS- LOOKING FOR WORK. LET'S A LET'S OBVIOUSLY GIVEN IT'S TIME RIGHT NOW THERE'S NOT A LOT OF EMPLOYMENT OUT THERE SO WE ARE RELAXED THAT REQUIREMENT. IN WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO DO BASED ON FEDERAL AND STATE GUIDANCE AND OFFERED FLEXIBILITY FOR THE PANDEMIC BETWEEN JUNE AND AUGUST THE JUNE FIFTEENTH AND AUGUST TENTH. WE ALLOWED- FIFTEEN POINT TWO MILLION ELIGIBILITY ISSUES TO BE AUTOMATICALLY CLEARED RESULTING IN FRONT PAYMENTS ALLOWING STAFF TO FOCUS ON CRITICAL WORKLOADS. SO WE IMPLEMENTED A MARTIAN WE'VE BEEN DOING IT CONTINUOUSLY TO PUSH PAYMENTS PEOPLE. GET RID OF ISSUES AND BE ABLE TO PUSH PEOPLE THROUGH SO THEY GET PAID. WE ALSO MODIFIED ARE YOU AYE ONLINE CLAIM APPLICATION PROCESS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF AUTO PROCESSING AND PLANES WITHOUT STAFF INTERVENTION. AS OF JULY THIRTY ONE WE HAD 69% OF APPLICATIONS ARE FILED AN EASY SYSTEM WITHIN- TWENTY FOUR HOURS WE IMPLEMENTED THAT IN APRIL AND WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT AS WELL. AND YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN- WE STARTED THAT TEXT CAMPAIGN. BACK IN THE SPRING WE HAVE NOW SENT OUT OVER TEN POINT SIX MILLION TAX AND THREE POINT SIX TO THREE POINT SIX MILLION CLAIMANTS. WE NEED A REMINDER EMAILS TO CLAIM IT SAID I'M NOT CERTIFIED FOR BENEFITS WE IMPLEMENT THAT GINO WE CONTINUOUSLY DO THAT AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE I THINK WE'RE SEEING GREAT MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE GOING IN AND- NOW CERTIFYING FOR BENEFITS. UP WE RELAX EDUCATION TIMELINESS RULES TO ALLOW CERTIFICATIONS TO BE PROCESSED IS OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE UP TO A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS VERSUS THE TWENTY ONE DAYS. WE FOUND THAT WAS REALLY WE'RE HAVING A LOT OF PEOPLE NOT COMING BACK IN PRIOR TO THE TWENTY ONE DAYS AND THEN THEY'RE HAVING TO REOPEN THE CLAIM IT JUST BECAME VERY CONFUSING. SO WE TOOK A LOOK AT IT AND- CHECK TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY LAWS OR ANYTHING ANY REASON LIKE WE COULDN'T CHANGE IT. AND SO WHEN WE FELT WE FELT WE COULD SO WE CHANGED IT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. AND NOW IT- ALL THE WAY UP TO A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS SO I THINK THAT WILL REALLY HELP- REDUCE THE BURDEN ON CLAIMANTS. ALSO WE ISSUED REMINDER EMAILS TO CLAIMANTS THAT HAVE NOT PROVIDED WAIT INFORMATION WE JUST ROLL THIS OUT THIS WEEKEND. SO MOVING FORWARD NOW CLAIMANTS TO PROVIDE WAIT INFORMATION WILL BE SENDING. REMINDER EMAILS ON THAT JUST LIKE WE'RE DOING FOR MAKE SURE YOU CERTIFIED. SO I THINK THAT WILL- HELP INCREASE OF THAT POPULATION- AND HELP THEM MOVE ALONG AS WELL. AND THEN WE DEPLOYED- THE KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO MORE QUICKLY ON BOARD MORE HIRES AND INSURE MORE TIMELY GREATER CONTINUITY. I RESPONSES PROVIDED BY THE CALL CENTER. WE ROLLED THAT OUT A- AUGUST WHEN AND THAT'S A CONTINUOUS PROCESS BUT IT'S OUR STAFF LOVE THAT. OKAY. ATV ACTION PLAN UNDER WAY THINGS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW IN PROGRESS IS ENHANCEMENT TO THE U. I. ONLINE TO ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO UPLOAD IDENTITY DOCUMENTS. WE'RE EXPERIENCE SITE ABOUT THIS ONE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH DOCUSIGN- TERROR BUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE EXPERTS AND WE WERE ABLE TO ACCELERATE THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION. AND WE'RE ON SCHEDULE NOW TO IMPLEMENT SEPTEMBER ONE TWENTY TWENTY I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW EXCITED BUT WE'RE ABOUT THIS BECAUSE- TWO THINGS WILL HELP IMPROVE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE GREATLY. THEY WON'T HAVE TO SEND THINGS IN BY SNAIL MAIL AND- ALSO INCREASE OUR PROCESSING OUR ABILITY TO TURN THINGS AROUND. SO THAT'S EXCITING. I IN PROGRESS IS ENHANCEMENTS TO THE U. I. LINE TO ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO UPLOAD WAGE DOCUMENTS ELECTRONICALLY FOR THOSE CUSTOMERS ARE MISSING WAGES SO WE'RE STARTING WITH A IDENTITY DOCUMENTS AND THEN WE'RE MOVING TO THAT WAGE DOCUMENTS. WE ALSO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE CLAIM STATUS OR TRANSITION- TRANSPARENT YOU AYE ONLINE SO CUSTOMERS HAVE VISIBILITY INTO THE VERY FIRST. WE DO SEND- HARD COPY NOTICES EXPLAINING IT BUT IT'S NOT CURRENTLY ON ARE YOU ON EXPLAINING THE REASONS. AND OR ACTIVELY WORKING ON THAT AND WE SHOULD FINISH DISCOVERY US SEPTEMBER FOURTH AND THEN DECIDE HOW HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT. WE'RE ADDING A SKILLS BASED ROUTING TO THE UPGRADED VIRTUAL CONTACT CENTER TO ALLOW ESCALATED CALLS TO BE TRANSFERRED IN TRAINED. CLAIMS ARE PROCESSING STUFF THAT'S ONE SCHEDULED TO BE RELEASED AT THE END OF THE MONTH. OR END OF OCTOBER SKEWS ME. AND THEN- OF COURSE WE'RE WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STRIKE TEAM TO FURTHER EXPLORE TECHNOLOGY OPTIONS AND CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE I'M THRILLED ABOUT THAT- THE WORKING WITH THEM CLOSELY. I CAN SEE THEY'RE GOING TO COME BACK WITH SOME GREAT IDEAS TO FURTHER MOVE US TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE AND ENHANCING OUR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. THE LAST SLIDE. I JUST WANTED TO BRING OUT THE SINCE THIS IS A VERY CURRENT IS THE LOST WAGES ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. IT WAS AUTHORIZED ON AUGUST EIGHTH- BUT THE OTHER PRESIDENTIAL MEMORANDUM. INA APPROVED OUR APPLICATION ON FRIDAY FOR FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION WHICH EQUATES TO ABOUT THREE WEEKS OF SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS. WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF ADDITIONAL BENEFITS MOVING FORWARD- THIS WILL BE AVAILABLE STARTING FOR THE WEEK AT THE AUGUST FIRST IS WHEN I'LL BE ALLOWED.

I KNOW HOW- THEY CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THE LIVELIHOOD OF OUR NEIGHBORS AND OUR COMMUNITIES- THERE THERE MIGHT ROCK STARS AND THEY'RE AWESOME AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNOW THAT. SHE RIGHT THANK YOU. FOR YOUR GONNA WANT TO. RICHARDSON SECTOR GOV OFFER. AGENCY AND HEAD OF THE EASY STRIKE TEAM. GOOD MORE MISS RICHARDSON. GOOD MORNING CAN YOU HEAR ME YES LET ME CLEAR. AWESOME GOOD MORNING- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR TODAY. SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT THE EDT STRIKE TEAM APPOINTED BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS AT THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. IN ORDER TO SPEED THE PROCESSING OF CLAIMS- I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND THAT THE GOVERNOR IS DETERMINED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES NEEDED WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT TO GET THINGS BACK ON TRACK. OUR JOB AS THE EDT STRIKE TEAM IS TO PROVIDE HIM WITH IMMEDIATE. ACTIONABLE STEPS THAT CAN BE TAKEN TO HAVE THE BIGGEST AND MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON SPEEDING THE PROCESS OF YOU AYE CLAIMS. WE'RE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS AND I'M CONFIDENT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE ROBUST RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE GOVERNOR AND EARLY SEPTEMBER CONSISTENT WITH HIS DIRECTION THAT WE REPORT BACK WITHIN FORTY FIVE DAYS. THAT SAID WE ARE NOT WAITING UNTIL THEN TO ACT AND I WANT TO ASSURE YOU WE ARE WORKING WITH DIRECTOR HILLIARD AND HER TEAM SHE MENTIONED. TO HELP MAKE IMMEDIATE CHANGES WHEN POSSIBLE. TODAY I WANT TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT WITH YOU ABOUT INFORMATION ABOUT THE STRIKE TEAM AND PROVIDE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN UNDERWAY. I AM THE CO CHAIR OF THE TEAM ALONG WITH JENNIFER PARKER. A CALIFORNIA AND A WELL KNOWN LEADER IN GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY. WORKING WITH THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE QUICKLY CONVENE A GROUP WITH KNOWLEDGE OF EDT. EXPERTISE TO EXAMINE SYSTEMS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT AND SKILLS TO IDENTIFY WHERE THE PROCESSES ARE BREAKING DOWN AND CAUSES. WE ALL KNOW THAT THIS PANDEMIC HAS TRIGGERED AN UNPRECEDENTED VOLUME OF CLAIMS. AND THAT HAS OVERWHELMED A SYSTEM THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON SPECIALIZED HUMAN LABOR. OUR TEAM IS BRINGING A FRESH SET OF EYES NOT BURDENED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF RUNNING THE PROGRAM DURING A CRISIS. WE HAD A PRODUCTIVE THREE WEEKS MEETING WITH FRONTLINE EMPLOYEES CLAIMANTS MANAGER'S LEADERSHIP STAFF AND WITH LEGISLATORS. WE THE TEAM HAS VISITED VISITED OFFICES IN SACRAMENTO AND RANCHO CORDOVA TO MEET WITH MANAGERS AND TEAMS FROM DIFFERENT DIVISIONS TO UNDERSTAND THE WORK THAT THEY DO. THEY HAVE REVIEW TRAINING MANUALS AND MATERIALS SHUTTLED EMPLOYEES WORKING ON CLAIMS AND FOLLOWING REAL INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS AS THEY MOVE THROUGH ED'S MANY DATA SYSTEMS AND DIVISIONS. THE TEAM VISITED THE CENTRAL DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT IDENTITY VERIFICATION AN OVERPAYMENT UNITSWITH THE DEPARTMENT CONDUCTING INTERVIEWS WITH MANAGERS AND LEADERSHIP AND FRONTLINE WORKERS. THE TEAM HAS EVALUATED THE CLAIMANT EXPERIENCE BY SPEAKING WITH CLAIMANTS REVIEWING LEGISLATIVE FEEDBACK ACCESSING SOCIAL MEDIA AND CHATBOTS QUERIES REVIEWING NOTICES REVIEWING CALL CENTER DATA AND LOOKING AT ELECTRONIC AND MAIL COMMUNICATIONS SENT BY CLAIMANTS TO EATING. THE TEAM HAS MET WITH THE IT SPECIALIST WHO RUN TEN INDIVIDUAL IT SYSTEMS WITH ANYBODY UNDERSTAND HOW EACH OF THEM WORKS AND WE'RE CHALLENGES LIE. THE TEAM HAS OBSERVE PHONE SESSIONS WITH EIGHTY SERVICE CENTER REPRESENTATIVES AND CLAIMANTS TO EXPLORE BREAKDOWNS ARE OCCURRING INCLUDING WHERE CLAIMS ARE GETTING DERAILED AND WHY. USING A DATA DRIVEN APPROACH THE TEAM IS ANALYZING CLAIMS TECHNICAL SYSTEM AND WORK USED. TO IDENTIFY PROBLEMS. AND THE TEAM HAS PUT THEMSELVES IN THE SHOES OF CLAIMANTS LOOKING AT MANY OF THE COMMUNICATIONS THEY RECEIVE AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS ALL TOO COMMON TO RECEIVE NO COMMUNICATION AT ALL. THE PROBLEM IS THAT EIGHTY D. ARE COMPLEX AND MULTI FACETED. IT ISN'T AS SIMPLE AS JUST GETTING NEW SOFTWARE LOADED OR MORE PEOPLE ANSWERING THE PHONES. BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT ISSUES THAT CAN BE SOLVED INCLUDING POLICY OP SCHOOL OBSTACLES. THAT MAKE MANAGING THE PROGRAM DIFFERENT DIFFICULT AND INEFFICIENT. WE WILL MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CHANGES IN LAW AND REGULATION. AS WELL AS CHANGES TO OPERATION POLICIES AND PROCESSES TO SPEED THE PROCESSING OF CLAIMS IMMEDIATELY. SOME CHANGES ARE ALREADY BEING IMPLEMENTED AS YOU HEARD FROM DIRECTOR HILLIARD SUCH AS BEGINNING PILOTS ON ELECTRONIC DOCUMENT UPLOADING AND SORTING AND RESOLVING CLAIMS BASED ON AGING. WE ARE WORKING TO HELP EIGHTY D. ACCELERATE AND OPTIMIZE THESE EFFORTS SO THAT THERE ARE NO DELAYS IN MAKING CHANGES THAT CAN IMPROVE THE CLAIM EXPERIENCE. DURING THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. WE WILL WORK WITH EIGHTY D. TO TEST ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE POSSIBLE DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. SO THAT WE CAN COME BACK TO THE GOVERNOR. THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WITH THE ROAD MAP FOR CHANGES THAT CAN AND WILL MAKE EDT SYSTEMS BETTER. I KNOW THAT FEEL LIKE TIME WE CANNOT WASTE I CAN ASSURE YOU WE UNDERSTAND THE SENSE OF URGENCY. BUT WENEED TO ENSURE THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE PUT FORTH HAD THE INTENDED EFFECTS THAT WE WOULD LIKE THEM TO HAVE. RIGHT NOW THE TEAM IS PULLING DATA TO GET A CLEAR PICTURE. OF THE DATA THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PUBLIC IN THE WAYS THAT THEY VIEW IT TO MAKE IT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND. BOTH NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. AND EARLY SEPTEMBER WE WILL MAKE ADDITIONAL DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR LONG TERM CHANGE TO AVOID PROBLEMS LIKE THE ONES THAT EDTA IS EXPERIENCING NOW. AND HAVE BEEN COMPOUNDED BY THE OLD WAY OF PROCURING AND IMPLEMENTING TECHNOLOGY. ALL OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WILL BE MADE AS A RESULT OF RIGOROUS ANALYSIS. DATA DRIVEN APPROACH TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. AND WITH AN EYE TOWARD HELL WE BUILD SYSTEMS IN THE FUTURE THAT ARE NIMBLE ADAPTABLE AND USER FRIENDLY. AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR TODAY I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT WE ARE FULLY AWARE. THAT REAL PEOPLE NEED REAL HELP RIGHT NOW AND THE STRIKE TEAM IS WORKING WITH GREAT SPEED. TO HELP TO ENSURE CALIFORNIANS GET HELP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT UP IS BRIAN WHEELER FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. FOR THOSE LISTENING IN THE L. A. L. HAND OUT IS HOSTED ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR WEBPAGE WITH THE AGENDA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BRIAN YOU ARE FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE WANTED OFFERED THREE SUGGESTIONS TODAY TO THE- TO THE LEGISLATURE AS YOU CONSIDER HOW TO GUIDE THE ADMINISTRATION AND MAKING IMPROVEMENTS. AT EDT. FIRST WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU ASK THE LEGISLATIVE ADMINISTRATION A TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE A DOCUMENT THAT PROVIDES A CLEAR CATALOGING OF ALL OF THE ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO DATE TO IMPROVE OPERATIONS AT EDT- INCLUDING WHEN THOSE ACTIONS WERE PUT INTO PLACE OR WHEN THEY ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE PUT INTO PLACE- AND HOW THE ADMINISTRATION. ANTICIPATES THAT THEY WILL LEAD TO IMPROVEMENTS AT EDT I WE FOR A LOT OF GOOD INFORMATION TODAY ABOUT ACTIONS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN TAKEN I THINK THIS CLEAR A CLEAR CATALOGUING FOR THE LEGISLATURE COULD HELP- TO IDENTIFY WHAT'S WORKED AND WHAT HASN'T TO IDENTIFY WHERE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES MAY BE NECESSARY OR- WHERE ADDITIONAL POLICY CHANGES. MAY BE NEEDED IN AREAS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN FULLY DRESSED YET. ARE SO SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO FOCUS ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF KEY ACTIONS THAT CAN GENERATE- AND IMMEDIATE IMPACT. US SOME OF THE CHALLENGES CURRENTLY BEING FACED- EDT SUCH AS THE LIMITATIONS OF ITS OUTDATED- I. T. SYSTEM ARE A LONG STANDING ISSUES. AND ALL THE STATE WILL IT WILL EVENTUALLY I NEED TO MAKE NUMEROUS MEDIUM TO LONG TERM CHANGES TO BRING ABOUT IMPROVEMENTS IN EIGHTIES OPERATIONS- PLACING SO MUCH FOCUS ON THOSE LONGER TERM ISSUES RIGHT NOW. A COULD DIVERT RESOURCES AND EFFORT AWAY FROM IN ADDRESSING THE IMMEDIATE CRISIS AND SO WE WOULD SUGGEST AND MOVING FORWARD IN TALKING ABOUT- PERHAPS WHICH ACTIONS FROM THE STRIKE TEAM TO PURSUE. VILLAGES THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD HAVE A DIALOGUE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THE TRADEOFFS. OF ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE LONGER TERM ISSUES VERSUS DEDICATING RESOURCES AND EFFORT. TO FIXING THE IMMEDIATE CRISIS FINALLY WE WOULD SUGGEST IDENTIFYING A FEW KEY INDICATORS TO TRACK OUR PROGRESS. AT EDT BASED ON THE ACTIONS OF A MAN TAKEN TO DATE AND WHATEVER ACTIONS THE STRIKE TEAM MAY SUGGEST- WE WORKED WITH YOUR STAFF I TO IDENTIFY FIVE KEY INDICATORS- THAT- AND WE'VE PUT THESE INDICATORS INTO SOME REPORTING TRAILER BILL- THAT WOULD ASK EDT TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION ON A CONSISTENT BASIS EVERY TWO WEEKS- TO THE LEGISLATURE AND TO THE PUBLIC ON THEIR WEBSITE. I AND WE THINK THAT THESE METRICS SHOULD GIVE A SHOULD BE. SHOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO DRAW CLEAR PICTURE ABOUT PROGRESS THAT'S BEING MADE AND CLEARING UP. SOME OF THE BACKLOG EDT IN IMPROVING TIME AND IN CLAIM PROCESS. A WE WERE KNOW THOUGH THAT WE THINK THESE AND ARE THE BEST ONES IN THE CLEAREST ONE TO BE TRACKING FOR THE SHORT TERM FOR THE GAME. THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE IMMEDIATE CRISIS. AS THE- CRISIS STARTS TO ABATE THOUGH YOU MIGHT WANT TO REEVALUATE THESE INDICATORS AND START PLACING MORE WEIGHT ON SOME OF THE MORE TRADITIONAL TIMELESSNESS METRICS- SUCH AS THE ONES THAT THE DIRECTOR I TALKED ABOUT. EARLIER WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF TO EVALUATE THIS DATA AS IT COMES IN FROM THE DEPARTMENT AND HELP YOU TO. GAUGE WHETHER IT IS SHOWING THAT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE AT EDT. HAVE ANY ANSWERING QUESTIONS THANK YOU AND INALLY WE HAVE MORE COMMITMENTS WITH THE DEPARTMENT. OF FINANCE MR MENACE. I AM ARGUMENT A PERMANENT I'M NOT BEING. AS BUT I AM AVAILABLE ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR COMMENTS I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO START WITH THE MOVE ON THE OTHER MEMBERS TO THEIR QUESTIONS. AND. THE FIRST QUESTION FOR MISS HILLIARD. YES. WHAT IS THE CURRENT WAIT TIME FOR A CALL BACK FROM EIGHTY D. CURRENTLY- WE'RE ABOUT THIRTEEN THOUSAND IN THE QUEUE AND WE'RE WORKING WE'RE ON AUGUST TWENTIETH RIGHT NOW. OKAY. SO WE CAN DO IS ONE OF TWO WAYS THE MEMBERS WE CAN. EVERYONE ACCIDENT DISLOCATION YOU CAN JUST QUEUE UP AND- TELL ME WANT TO ASK QUESTIONS OF SO IT'S A QUESTION FROM A FULL YEAR. YES GOVERNOR. THIS PETRIE-NORRIS OKAY HI TO HILLIARD THANK FOR PROVIDE US WITH STATE AND GIVING GIVE US THIS CONTENT TO DIG INTO JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IF YOU WERE GOING THROUGH THIS PRESENTATION AT FIRST ON THE AT THE STAFF LEVELS SO I BELIEVE YOU SAID THAT THE GOAL IS TO GROW THE TEAM AND THEY'LL HAVE NINETEEN HUNDRED CALL CENTER REPS WHO WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND EIGHTEEN HUNDRED. WHAT I WOULD CALL CASE WORKERS WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL LEVEL TWO OR SOMETHING ELSE DID I UNDERSTAND THAT CORRECTLY OKAY- YES OKAY BUT WHAT WHAT WHAT DO YOU CALL THOSE PEOPLE CASE WORKERS LEVEL TWO WHAT SHOULD WE- THERE ARE POINT. PRO REPRESENTATIVES THAT. THE IN NATIONAL STAFF TO HELP ON THE CALL. SPECIFIC USE GOT IT OKAY SO I. OUR COMPLAINT PROGRAM ARE PRESENTED AS I'D LOOK WHEN WE LAST SPOKE AT THE END OF JULY THERE WERE A HUNDRED OF THOSE FOLKS THAT WERE. ON THE PHONES. YOUR GOAL IS TO GROW UP TO EIGHTEEN HUNDRED WHERE ARE WE RIGHT NOW. IF YOU LOOK ON THE CHART YEAH- BY THE END OF- AUGUST- WE'LL TO TALK. AND YOUR CARD IT IS SIXTEEN SIXTY ONE I WAS JUST TRYING TO ADD THAT SIXTEEN SIXTY ONE IS WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE ON THE CHART I'M GLAD THAT IS A LITTLE. ON THE CHART I'M LOOKING AT IT'S ALL BLANK SO IT IT HAS YOU AYE CLAIM SUPPORT. APRIL TO JUNE YOU I STAFF LEVEL A HUNDRED AND THENEVERYTHING ELSE ALL THE OTHER BOXES ARE. PERFECT BLANK OCTOBER TRANSFER RIGHT CENTERS LAST MINUTE RIGHT WHAT I'M TRYING. YEAH WHAT I'M TRYING TO PORTRAY IS THAT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE COMBINING BOTH OF THOSE CALL CENTERS. CALL LINES INTO ONE IN OCTOBER SO THEY'LL ALL BE TOGETHER AND AS SUCH WITH THE SKILL BASED ROUTING AND IT- ADDITION OF ALL THE PROFESSIONAL STAFF. WHAT WE'RE GONNA END UP WITH IS THE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED- EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM WRAPS IT CAN REALLY DIG INTO THOSE MORE COMPLEX CLAIMS. GREAT I THINK YOU YEAH AND SO I ST WITH SORRY WHERE WE TODAY SO WE HAD A HUNDRED ON JULY THIRTY FIRST AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED BUT HOW MANY DO WE HAVE TODAY RIGHT YEAH LET ME LET ME JUST CONFIRM WITH. MICHELLE SHE OF THE NUMBERS. IN A LOT OF. YEAH WE DON'T HAVE IT RIGHT BY OUR BUT I WAS THIS TO YOU FALL THE HEARING OKAY THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL AND THAT WAS A MAJOR AREA OF FOCUS ON THAT IN OUR LAB SELECTION OKAY AND THEN YEAH PAGE THREE CALL CENTER. SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE OFFERING 40% OF CALLS SO WHAT HAPPENS. TO THESE OTHER CALLS. THEY JUST PEOPLE HANG UP THERE'S GIVE U. OR ARE THEY CALL BACK LATER AND I KEEP TRYING OR THEY EMAIL I MEAN. NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO KEEP IMPROVING EVERY ABILITY TO RESPOND BECAUSE ANYBODY NOT SERVED IS IT'S NOT A GOOD SITUATION. SO THAT'S WHY I WANT TO CONTINUE TO ADD RESOURCES AND I WOULD LIKE TO GO WAY BEYOND WHERE WE WERE PRE PANDEMIC AND REALLY BE CUT HAVE A CALL CENTER THAT WORK. WE'RE PROUD OF- AND THAT WE'RE SERVING RATE BODY SELF YEAH IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A GOOD SITUATION- WE'RE DEFINITELY DOING BETTER MUCH BETTER THAN WE WERE- BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE KNOW- WE WANT TO GET TO A PLACE. WHERE WE'RE PROUD OF IT. AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING. BUT ON THE CALL CENTER IN IN FEBRUARY BEFORE PAY DEPEND KIT WE'RE ONLY FIFTY FOUR PER IF YOU MISSED TO YEAH MR STERN IS A WHY EVERYBODY PERCENT SO WASN'T IT A PER PREPEND BECAUSE WHENEVER YES WE NEVER HAVE- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT FUN FOR CALL CENTER ACTIVITIES- THEY DON'T AND SO WE DIDN'T HAVE THE FUNDING IN ORDER TO FOR SUPPORT ANYBODY ABOUT ME ON THAT IN ORDER TO BE AWARE THAT FOCUS OUR RESOURCES ON PAYING PEOPLE. BUT WITH THE WITH THE PANDEMIC DID SOME- SOME TEMPORARY OF FUNDING- YOU KNOW SO I'M USING THE FUNDING TO REALLY ELEVATE OUR CENTER NOW AFTER THE PANDEMIC WHEN IT GETS BACK INTO NORMAL TIMES I'M CONCERNED BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'LL GO BACK TO THE SITUATION AS WELL WE HAVE FUNDING TO REALLY- SUPPORT OR CALL CENTER SO THAT IS SOMETHING- IN THE NEXT YEAR TOO I THINK WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT AS FAR AS WHAT WHAT DO WE WANT EDT TO LOOK LIKE MOVING FORWARD. BECAUSE BUT IN THE PAST OBVIOUSLY SO SOUNDS LIKE THIS BEFORE. HAS BEEN THE NORM FIFTY. SO I GUESS MIKE I ASKED IN THE PAST. IS THE LEADERSHIP EVER PUT A FOR BC. TO GET PERSONNEL. AND WE DO WE DO RECEIVE. STATE FUNDING FOR IT. BUT BUT BEFORE THAT AND SO I MISS THAT YOU SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE CALL CENTER. FOR ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEES GOT TO LOWER THAT NUMBER SO. I WOULD SAY I WOULD GUESS IF YOU PUT IN FOR IT- YOU'VE BEEN TURNED DOWN FOR WHEN YOU'VE APPLIED FOR IT IS THAT CORRECT. UP WELL PARTIALLY I MEAN WE DO HAVE RECEIVED FUNDING FROM THE STATE THAT SUPPLEMENT IN ORDER FOR US TO- ANSWER CALLS BECAUSE- PRIOR TO THAT WE WERE ANSWERING AT A MUCH LOWER LEVEL UNTIL THE LAST FEW YEARS WHEN THE STATE STEPPED IN TO HELP SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM THAT IS. TERRIBLY UNDERFUNDED AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. SO YOU CAN GET A LITTLE LOWER THAN 54% I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S REALLY THEY CAN UNFORTUNATELY KNOW IT'S TERRIBLE. I KEEP. YEAH ABSOLUTE COURSE YOU CAN FIND ON ABOUT. AT GOOD ACTUALLY DIED AT I THINK FOR ALL OF US. I THINK WE'RE ALL REALLY SURPRISE TO SEE THAT NUMBER BE. PREPEND THEM OUT WE WERE EXPERIENCING RECORD LOW UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE STATE. SO YEAH THAT THAT RAISES AT REACTIVE BIG RED FLAG FOR ME AS WELL. RECORD LOW UNEMPLOYMENT TIMES RECORD LOW STAFFING LEVELS BECAUSE OUR FUNDING DECREASES IN LINE WITH THAT- THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. SO YOU KNOW. THAT THE FUNDING THAT WE GET GOES DOWN TO SO WE CAN ONLY STAFF WHAT WE HAVE FUNDING FOR. AND IT'S SHAMEFUL IT'S SHAMEFUL NATIONALLY I'M NOT OF THE STATE'S ARE IN GOOD SHAPE WHEN IT COMES TO. ANSWERING CALLS AND IT'S JUST SHAMEFUL FOR A NATION OF OUR OUR- GREAT LEVEL. OKAY YES I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT THIS IS. AND I OKAY SO. MOVING TO SLIDE FOR. THE FIVE. BUT UNPAID CLAIMS. SO WE STILL HAVE ONE MILLION UNPAID CLAIMS. IS THAT CORRECT. UNPAID YEAH YES OKAY AND- WHAT IS WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO BE CLEARED YOU SAID IT'S A PORTION OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE CLEARED BY THE END OF SEPTEMBER. CAN YOU JUST BREAK THAT DOWN. OF THE TO. THE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THOUSAND IS- THE ONES THAT WILL BE CLEARED BY THE END OF SEPTEMBER THAT WE- COMMITTED TO. AND THE OTHER BUCKETS- LIKE I SAID WE'VE MADE GREAT PROGRESS TO- BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE GONE IN AND CERTIFIED- AS YOU WILL SEE THE PAID AMOUNT WENT UP. A 2% TO AND THAT'S BECAUSE- PEOPLE ARE GOING IN AND CERTIFYING AND- FOR BENEFITS AND THEN THEY'RE GETTING. PAID OR THEIR- IF THERE'S ANY ISSUES AND WORK THEIR WORK WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM SO. THE UNEMPLOYMENT SYSTEM AS IS. EVERY DAY'S A DIFFERENT DAY I'M MOVING. YOU KNOW THEY'RE MOVING FROM. INITIAL CLAIMS TO CONTINUE CLAIMS TO. DIFFERENT PLACES IN THE PROCESS SO. WE SEEM GREAT MOVEMENT IN THIS LAST FOUR WEEKS. A I THINK ONE THING I WOULD FIND INCREDIBLY HELPFUL AND I IMAGINE SO MY COLLEAGUES WOULD AS WELL IS. IF WE COULD JUST GET SOME ADDITIONAL VISIBILITY INTO THAT THE BALANCE THAT'S ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND. TO UNDERSTAND YEAH- YOU KNOW. WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON THOSE BECAUSE FROM RIGHT ACCURATE SAYING WE'VE WE'VE GOT ADDED RESOLUTION IN SIGHT FOR TWO HUNDRED THIRTY NINE. BUT WE REALLY DON'T. HAVE A PLAN FOR SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND SO IF WE CAN GET SOME ADDITIONAL VISIBILITY IN ADDITIONAL DETAIL TO WHAT THE HURDLES ARE THAT WOULD BE. INCREDIBLY YEAH VALUABLE. I'M WE DO HAVE A PLAN PEOPLE ARE MOVING AND BEING PAID AND- THEY DISLOCATIONS THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEEING THE 47% REDUCTION- OF- AND PEOPLE MOVING TO EITHER PAID OR ON ELIGIBLE OR WHEREVER THEY LAND. BUT ON ALL THE VISIBILITY FOR DATA WE STARTED WORKING WITH THE STRIKE TEAM LAST WEEK TO REDEFINE ALL OF OUR BUCKETS AND MAKING SURE. THAT WE'RE APPROACHING REPORTING FROM A CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE- APPROACH. SO AT I THINK IN THE FUTURE AFTER WE WORK THROUGH THE DETAILS AS- SECRETARY RICHARDSON SAID. I'M TRYING SOME THINGS AND THEN BE ABLE TO PROVIDE GOOD GOOD RECOMMENDATIONS I'M EXCITED TO SEE HOW WE SORT OF RECAST. OUR REPORTING SO- YOU KNOW IT MAKES SENSE TO AND DIGESTIBLE FOR THE OUTSIDE WORLD. YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING ADMITTEDLY WITH REPORTING BECAUSE OF OUR OLD ANTIQUATED SYSTEMS. SO I'M EAGER TO YOU KNOW WE'VE ALREADY HAD SOME GOOD CONVERSATION AND A FRESH LOOK AT HOW. HOW TO REPORT SO THERE'LL BE A LOT MORE COMING YOUR WAY AS FAR THAT AS FAR AS THAT GOES I'M SURE. GONNA WANT YOUR INPUT ON ON WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. OKAY GREAT AND BEFORE I BEFORE BEFORE I HANDED OVER I DO WANT TO TOUCH ON YOU MENTIONED. THAT YOU'RE ANTIQUATED SYSTEMS AND- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY. IN THE LAST HEARING AND I YOU CAN PRE. BRIEFING THE SENSE I'VE GOTTEN THE- IS. SORT OF THE SENSE ET TECHNO IS TO THIS INTO. PROBLEM AND WE'VE GOT THE SORT OF IN. HURDLES LIKE LEGACY SYSTEMS AND HER AND- COBALT. I WAS. THE FOLLOWING LAST YEAR I AND I NUMBER OF COLLEAGUES AND PERHAPS EVEN OTHERS ON THAT ARE ON THE PANEL. I WAS CONTACTED BY A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES WHO. AREN'T CAN NAME BRAND PROVEN ENTITIES WHO HAVE IMPLEMENTED SOLUTIONS AND OTHER STATES WHO HAVE SAID THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE SOLUTIONS THAT CAN HELP CALIFORNIA AND A MATTER OF. WEEKS NOT MONTHS AND- TO HAVE OU BEEN CONTACTED BY THESE COMPANIES AS WELL WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION. AND BEEN TALKING TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT VENDORS AND NUMBER DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS JUST LIKE DOCUSIGN THERE'S ONE RIGHT THERE. THAT WE'RE BRINGING IN- SO WE WOULD HAVE NEVER DIFFERENT VENDORS ARE USING TO HELP- HELP WITH ALL OF THAT TECHNOLOGY AND LIKE. A SECRETARY RICHARDSON SAID I'M I KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO COME UP WITH SOME MORE GREAT. THOUGHT SO- I THINK YEAH I THINK YOU'LL BE SEEING MORE OF IT THAT MOST DEFINITELY. YOU HAVE THE I WAS SURPRISED SO THE FEEDBACK THAT THAT I. WAS THAT MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO REACH OUT TO YOU AND TO YOUR DEPARTMENT. WERE JUST IGNORED- AND YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S MY BROTHER'S START UP TECHNOLOGY THING IT WAS YOU KNOW THE NAME BRAND COMPANIES. SO I'M SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT AND- WOULD HOPE THAT WE- BRINGING. YOU KNOW EVERYONE TOGETHER TO. COME UP WITH CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON THIS AT. ABSOLUTELY AND YEAH YOU KNOW PLEASE KNOW THAT WE'RE GETTING- CONTACTED BY THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT VENDORS- WANTING TO ASK TO REVIEW- WHAT THEY'VE GOT GOING ON AND HOW THEY CAN HELP. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE PARTNERING WITH CD T. AN ODI TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE ALL THAT AND- GREAT TECHNOLOGISTS LOOKING AT IT. AND THAT WERE REALLY- WAITING THROUGH ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES AND FIGURE OUT WHAT MAKES SENSE FOR EDT. SO AGAIN I VALUE THAT PARTNERSHIP AND IT'S REALLY BEEN. HELPFUL TO MAKE SURE WE'RE MOVING EIGHTY IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. GREAT AND THEN JUST LASTLY I. THOUGHT THAT THE ALEJO'S DESERVED THREE VERY SIMPLE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE SPOT ON. IT ARE YOU SUPPORTIVE OF THOSE. YES I HAVE NO CONCERNS ABOUT THAT SOUND GOOD- WE CAN EASILY CATALOG WE ACTUALLY WE HAVE A WE HAVE A PRETTY MUCH KELLOGG BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT- THE METRICS ARE TALKED ABOUT WAS FINE AND- CERTAINLY THE SHORT TERM- THING WINDS THAT CAN BE DONE- I THINK THAT WILL COME OUT IS WORKING WITH THE STRIKE TEAM WE'VE ALREADY DONE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT. WOULD HELP SHORT TERM THAT YOU KNOW LOW IMPACT OR HIGH IMPACT WITH LOW EFFORT- SO I WELCOME ADDITIONAL IDEAS SO. AGAIN THAT'S A AND WORKING WITH THE STRIKE TEAM I THINK MORE OF THAT'S GOING TO COME OUT SO I THINK IT'S TERRIFIC. GREAT THANK YOU AND WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER L. L.'S OTHER TO. ARE YOU OKAY WITH THOSE. WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT I CAN. FOR THREE ON THE RECORDING WAS GOOD THAT WAS. AND TRADITIONAL MEASURE YEP THAT'S GOOD TO YEAH NO I WAS FINE WITH ALL OF THEM SURE IT IS MORE PUSHED ON THE CLAIMS THE CLAIM THAT AS ALWAYS PEOPLE ARE ENTERING ON THEIR OWN AND EVEN IF YOU'RE ONLINE AND NOT IT'S NOT EASY. I'VE BEEN IN MY WRONG PHONE NUMBER MY WRONG EMAIL BEFORE- ON SOCIAL ARE YOU GUYS TO GO TO THIS WE TALKED TO I KNOW I TALKED THE STARTING ABOUT THIS. ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO GO TO THIS FORMER AT LEAST TWICE TO MAKE SURE IT'S THE CORRECT INFORMATION BEING ENTERED BECAUSE THAT AMOUNT OF THE IMPRESSION ALL THESE CLAIMS BECAUSE SOMETIMES INFORMATION. GETS INJURED IN AN PEOPLE TRANSPOSE THE NUMBER. YEAH WE HAVE PROBLEM WITH THE SO. NUMBERS PARTICULARLY- AND WE HAVE SINCE FIXED THAT AND WE DO HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE WORK- YOU DO ENTER AT NUMBER OF TIMES I THINK THREE THREE TIMES. AGAINST SO THAT ROLLED OUT. I YEAH AWESOME SO IT'S EASY TO CREATE. BUT I WILL SAY WITH SOME EACH OFFICE BEING SLOW TO. A EASY RAP. STAFFERS TOLD ME MUCH BECAUSE- THEY'VE CLEARLY QUITE A FEW CLAIMS WORKING WITH ONE PERSON THEY'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THAT SO. YOU GUYS HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB ON THAT SO. AND I. THANK ALL YOUR ALL YOUR STAFF. BECAUSE WE AS YOU KNOW WE NEED A THEM EVERY TWO WEEKS AND ALLOW. REFERRAL PER. WEEK TO REFINE. UP BASED ON THEIR INPUT IN WHAT IF IS WORKING AND AT OUR LAST MEETING WE DID HEAR SOME REALLY GOOD FEEDBACK THAT- HAVING PEOPLE ASSIGNED TO THE VARIOUS OFFICES IS REALLY HELP CLEAR OUT SOME OF THOSE SPECIALLY THOSE ONES ARE LESS COMPLICATED. SO THANK YOU. MR TRUE. THANK YOU LET. THANK YOU ME JUST START WITH A OF. QUICK CALL. I KNOW WE'VE HAD AN ANTI COME ABOUT EDT AND- MANY OF US ABOUT CRITIQUES AROUND HOW EDS BEEN FAILING BUT I WANT TO START. AS OUR CHAIRMAN STARTED BY JUST THINKING OF PARTICULAR THE RANK AND FILE OF EDP WHO I KNOW ARE WORKING INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT SITUATION SO IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK FOR US TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEM- I ALSO WANT TO. REITERATE SOMETHING THAT I THINK YOU KNOW WHICH IS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS MONTH SEVENTY ONE MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE INCLUDING MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMITTEE SENT THE GOVERNOR A LETTER OUTLINING AT LEAST SIX AREAS IN WHICH WE ARE LOOKING FOR EASY REFORM. AND ON A POSITIVE NOTE I WANTED TO SAY HOW GRATEFUL I AM THAT THERE'S BEEN REAL MOVEMENT ON THE FIRST MAJOR RECOMMENDATION WHICH IS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DISTRICT TEAM- I KNOW THEY ARE WORKING HARD TO DIVE INTO WHAT NEEDS CHANGE. I HAVE A LOT OF FAITH IN THEIR LEADERSHIP SO LOOKING LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MIDDLE SEPTEMBER WHEN WE'RE GONNA GET THEIR INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS WHAT I DO WANT TO SAY IS WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED FEEDBACK ON PROBABLY ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE LETTER I KNOW DIRECTOR HILLIARD YOU AND I'VE NOT. HAD A CHANCE TO MEET YET ABOUT IT BUT- I WANT TO TOUCH ON SOME OF THOSE AREAS IN THE DISCUSSION AND LET ME JUST JUMP TO WHAT TO OUR RECOGNITION AND CLEARING THE BACKLOG AND SOME OF THE DATA THAT YOU PROVIDED THIS MORNING. IF I COULD JUST JUMP TO PAGE FIVE OF THE. DATA THAT YOU PRESENTED THIS MORNING. SO OF THE NUMBERS ARE. THE RELEASE OUT AT ME. THE GOOD. OF THE EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY TH. CLAY AS OF LAST MONTH. THAT MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WHICH DROPPED TO FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN. THOUSAND THAT'S GOOD NEWS. THE PENDING EDT RESOLUTION NUMBER TWO THIRTY NINE DROPPING EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND. THAT'S GOOD NEWS THE QUESTION I HAVE IS. IF WE RESOLVED OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND IN THE FIRST CATEGORY AND A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND THE SECOND CATEGORY. IT'S ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FOLKS IT SEEMS LIKE YOU PROCESS THE LAST MONTH. I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED. THE NUMBER OF FOLKS PAID. FOR THE NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO WERE DECLARED INELIGIBLE TO REFLECT. THE PROCESSING. WHERE THOSE NUMBERS GO. DID YOU UNDERSTAND THEY'RE ALL IN YES I DO THEY WENT INTO THE PAID THEY WENT INTO THE INELIGIBLE. THEY WENT INTO PENDING- THAT'S AT THE VERY BOTTOM YOU SEE. RESOLUTION DO SO THAT'S EXACTLY MY QUESTION SO THE PAID NUMBER CANNOT GO UP ONE FROM FOUR POINT EIGHT TO FOUR POINT NINE. THE INELIGIBLE WENT UP BY 1% ONE SIXTY TWO TO ONE SIXTY FOURTH. BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE SO JUST I DON'T SEE HOW THAT MATH COMPUTES. DOES THAT BECAUSE I CAN. YES IT IS DISCUSSING AND IT IS DISPERSED THROUGH THE VARIOUS BUCKETS- IF YOU WANT TO COMPLETE RECONCILIATION WE CERTAINLY CAN TAKE THAT BACK IN SENATE TO AFTER THE HEARING BUT CAN YOU GIVE ME A SENSE OF IF YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU PROCESS ALMOST SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND CLAIMANTS DID MOST OF THOSE FOLKS GET PAID. FOR MOST OF THOSE FOLKS DECLARED INELIGIBLE WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM. WHAT SOME OF THEM GOT PAID SOME OF THEM GOT UP FOUND AN ELIGIBLE AS A DATE IT REFLECTS AND- IS KNOWN TO THE PENDING RESOLUTION. I'M SORRY THE DATE IS ON FRONT OF US. RIGHT. SO THE CHART ON EIGHT TWENTY. SOME AT PLUS TWO FIRST 42% INCREASE IN A MORE PEOPLE GOT PAID- OF SOME PEOPLE- FEWER PEOPLE WERE ARE MORE PEOPLE WERE FOUND IN ELIGIBLE. THAT WENT UP AND THEN. MORE CASES CAME- TO EDT THAT NEED TO BE RESOLVED AND BE TOUCHED BY IT AT INDIVIDUAL. SUFFRAGISTS RESTATE THE QUESTION I'M SORRY I'M JUST I'M JUST BAFFLED BY THESE NUMBERS AGAIN SO YOU SAY THAT. THERE WERE SIX ABOUT CLOSE TO SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FOLKS THAT YOU MANAGE A PROCESS IN THE LAST MONTH AND THAT'S GREAT. WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS WHY DID THE UNPAID NUMBER ONLY GO UP BY A HUNDRED THOUSAND. AND THE INELIGIBLE NUMBER ONLY GO UP BY. LOOKS LIKE TWO THOUSAND. SO WHAT HAPPENED TO A HALF A MILLION PEOPLE WHERE THEY REFLECTED IN THIS. THE NUMBERS SO I LIKE IT. I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YEAH. DANJEL. YEAH WE'LL HAVE TO COME BACK AND- PROVIDE AN ACCOUNTING FOR IT BECAUSE- IT IS DISBURSED FOR ALL THE BUCKETS AND. WE'LL GET BACK TO ARE NOT APPRECIATE THEIR DISPERSED REGISTRADA OBVIOUSLY FIGURE OUT WHETHER DISPERSED. GOING BACK TO. FOUR WHERE YOU TALK ABOUT THE FACT AS AT THE END OF JULY 75% LIMITED RECEIVE THEIR FIRST PAYMENT. APPRECIATE THAT NUMBER ONE OF THE COMPLAINTS WE GET FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS AS THEY GET A FIRST PAYMENT. AND THEY DON'T HEAR FROM YOU TODAY FOR WEEKS IF NOT MONTHS. DO YOU HAVE ANY METRIC TO GET US A SENSE OF HOW MANY CLAIMANTS. TOTAL HAVEN'T RECEIVED THE PAYMENTS AT THE THINK OR DO THEY ARE DO. NOT AT THIS TIME BUT THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE DISCUSSING WITH THE STRAIGHT TEAM- LIKE I SAID WE WANT TO COME BACK AND WRITE HOLISTIC INFORMATION THAT IS THAT REALLY LAYS OUT THE EXPERIENCE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE IN THE JOURNEY. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE AREAS WERE IN DEEP DISCUSSION WITH THE STRIKE TEAM ABOUT. GREAT HI I'LL JUST REITERATE FOR THE STRIKE TEAM THAT'S A VERY COMMON COMPLAINT WE HAVE FROM CONSTITUENTS A MASSIVE TO CHECK IN MARCH. OR APRIL RIGHT THEN THERE'S SORT OF RADIO SILENCE AND THEY'VE NO IDEA WHAT'S HAPPENED. I'M GOING TO PAGE THREE OF THE CALL CENTER. AROUND CALL CENTER DATA I THINK ONE. METRIC THAT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW IS JUST. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CALLS IT'S ONE THING. TO KNOW HOW MANY CALLS ARE ANSWERING. BUT TO KNOW HOW MANY CALLS ARE COMING IN. HOW MANY CALLS INVOLVE REPEAT DIALING THAT'S THE INCREDIBLE FRUSTRATION THAT FOLKS ARE HAVING AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S NOT RIGHT IN THIS CHART BUT I DID- I DID- GIVE YOU VERBALLY A LAST MOST RECENTLY WAS FIVE POINT ONE MILLION CALLS WE RECEIVE IN A WEEK WE CERTAINLY CAPTURE THAT DATA AND IF THAT'S SOMETHING YOU WANT TO SEE WILL BE GLAD TO PROVIDE IT- THE CALLS HAVE COME DOWN. AND GREATLY. AND THAT'S WE'RE UP FOURTEEN. MILLION A WEEK AND NOW WE'RE DOWN TO FIVE POINT ONE MILLION A WEEK WHICH IS STILL. A HUGE HUGE. BUT I'M DEFINITELY GOING THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND ONE THING I'LL SAY ABOUT THAT IS WE ARE HEARING FROM CONSTITUENTS WHO. SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN EARLIER MONTHS CALLING INTO THE SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GET THROUGH THEY LITERALLY JUST GIVEN UP. SO YEAH ON THE ONE HAND IT'S GREAT THAT THE NUMBERS GOING DOWN IT COULD BE GOING DOWN FOR VARIETY REASONS AND I WANT TO JUST MENTION THAT. YEAH YEAH. SO RELATED TO THIS AT THE LAST HEARING YOU SUGGESTED THAT. THAT EDT WAS WORKING ON A DASHBOARD- METRICS. UNDERSTAND WHERE THINGS ARE. AND AGAIN PROBABLY WHERE THAT- A NUMBER OF US INCLUDING- THE CHAIRMAN AND HIS STAFF. THE CHAIR OF OUR ASSEMBLY INSURANCE COMMITTEE. OF MY OFFICE WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE TO UNDERSTAND. SORT OF METRICS EVERY TWO WEEKS WOULD BE. WOULD GRATEFUL. ON WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU IS THAT YOU'RE VERY WILLING TO COME TO WORK WITH US ON THAT. DO YOU GUYS HAVE A DASHBOARD UP AND- UP I THINK WHAT I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST IS FOR THE- FOR THE STRIKE FORCE. TO HELP PROPOSED FOR US THE RIGHT METRICS FOR US TO FOCUS ON BECAUSE A LOT OF NUMBERS YOU CAN FOCUS ON. AND ON. WE DON'T WANT TO BE I THINK OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE AND WHAT WE ASK YOU TO DO BUT I THINK. THERE ARE KEY DATA. THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS THE ORGANIZATION ON THE PUBLIC ON ON OUR MAKING PROGRESS ON THIS SO. WANT TO JUST GET A SENSE OF RIGHT NOW ABSOLUTELY. NOT WE CAME UP WITH A DRY. OUT BOARD BUT WE PURPOSE DIDN'T PUT OUT BECAUSE WHEN INDUSTRY TEAM WAS. IN AND WE WANTED TO OFFER. TO HAVE FRESH EYES BEEN TO CLOSE IT YOU KNOW AND WE NEED TO SET UP. ICE TAKE A LOOK AT IT. YEAH RECORD WHAT WOULD REALLY WORK IN IT I THOUGHT THE DASHBOARDS ALL TIED TO THE WHOLE. DATA REPORTING AND INVENTORIES AND ALL OF THAT SO LIKE I SAID WE STARTED WORKING LAST. WEEK WITH THE STRIKE TEAM. AND IF NOTHING GETS RIGHT. I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS PART TO REALLY- PUT SOME GOOD BRAINS BEHIND THIS AND- FINALLY GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN PROVIDE DATA THAT'S MEANINGFUL. FOR US IN MEANINGFUL FOR THE OUTSIDE WORLD WE ALL DESERVE THAT. IT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE I'M NOT I'M NOT HIDDEN THAT FROM DAY ONE- YOU KNOW OUR OUR ANTIQUATED SYSTEMS. PROVIDE DATA BASED ON. WHEN WORK GOES INTO A QUEUE IT'S NOT BASED ON THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE LIKE IT NEEDS TO BE. BUT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING WITH THE STRIKE TEAM TO HELP FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN TRANSLATE. INFORMATION THAT WE DO HAVE IN OUR ANTIQUATED SYSTEMS. INTO SOMETHING THAT IT PAINTS A PICTURE. HOLISTICALLY FOR THE CUSTOMER YOU REFERENCE THE CHALLENGES AROUND TECHNOLOGY AND I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THE COMMENTS OF- OF OUR COLLEAGUE- MISCARRIAGE NORRIS OVER JUST TECHNOLOGY AND THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A MAJOR SUBJECT OF OUR LETTER. OUR LETTER REFERENCED A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT EDIE'S. CHALLENGING HISTORY OF ENGAGING WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO MODERNIZE ITS SYSTEMS. PARTICULARLY AS YOUR DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN PARTNERING WITH DELIGHT. WHICH AS YOU KNOW IS RECEIVED OVER A QUARTER BILLION DOLLARS. IN RECENT YEARS TO WORK ON IT SYSTEM- YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE LIGHTS PERFORMANCE AND I WANT TO ASK YOU. YOU KNOW THE LAST HEARING. I ASK YOU A SERIES OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EDT AND LAW. FOR AND WAS FOR. TO ME. THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE VARIOUS. YES OR NO ANSWERS AND BY THE WAY THE ANSWERS YOU PROVIDED. FOR THE ONES THAT I THOUGHT WERE THE CORRECT ANSWERS. BUT WHEN OUR STAFF POSE THOSE SAME QUESTIONS TO DELOITTE. WE WERE SEE VERY CONTRADICTORY OR EVASIVE RESPONSES. TO THE SAME QUESTIONS AS I MENTIONED TO YOU. I'M CURIOUS SINCE THE LAST HEARING. WHAT HAS YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE LIGHT THAT. NOTHING'S CHANGED- I DID REACH OUT TO THE LATE AFTER THE HEARING TO FOLLOW UP ON WHAT- AND THERE IS A- COMMUNICATION ISSUE BECAUSE- THERE TOLD ME THAT WHAT I SAID WAS SPOT ON WITH THEM THERE ANDERSON THEIR FEELING OF THE RELATIONSHIP TO. ONE THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT DELOITTE- I UNDERSTAND YOUR FRUSTRATION WITH THEM THEY YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT THE YEARS IT'S A YOU KNOW ALWAYS A COMPETITIVE BID PROCESS THAT WE FOLLOW THAT IS- DETERMINED BY THE STATE AND MONITOR BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. I DON'T I DON'T YOU KNOW SELECT PEOPLE OR VENDORS IT ALL GOES THROUGH A VERY RIGOROUS COMPETITIVE BID PROCESS THAT'S STRUCTURED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT SO I MEAN IF YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE OVERALL PROCUREMENT OF. YOU KNOW FOR STATE AGENCIES- REALLY I THINK YOU NEED T READ DIRECT US TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY WE'RE FOLLOWING THE PROCESSES. AND THE STATE RULES AND REGULATIONS SO. YOU KNOW THE THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS IN AS A DIRECTOR AT IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M FOLLOWING THE DIRECTION OF THE MINISTRATION AND HOPING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND DOING WHAT NEEDS TO GET DONE BUT I DON'T MAKE THOSE RULES I BUT I MAKE SURE WE FOLLOW THEM APPROPRIATELY AND- FOLLOW ALL THE STEPS AS REQUIRED SO. THANKS I APPRECIATE THAT YOU REFER TO THE COMPETITIVE BID PROCESS BUT ISN'T IT TRUE. THAT THIS YEAR. YOU ACCEPTED TO NO BID CONTRACTS WITH THE LAWYER DURING THIS PANDEMIC TO WORK ON. THE SYSTEM. YES DUE TO THE PANDEMIC AND UP THE BILL USE EMERGENCY PROCUREMENT- THEY WERE THE VENDORS THAT- I'VE CREATED YOU I ON LINE. AND THAT'S WHERE WE NEEDED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ORDER TO TURNER- BRING ON THE- PANDEMIC IN EMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND OTHER PROGRAMS. SO WE NEEDED THEIR SUPPORT EMERGENCY SITUATION THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY ABSOLUTELY AGREED THEY WERE ON A LIST THAT HAD TO BE COMPLETE YEP- COMPETITIVELY- PUT ON SO- AT YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO QUALIFY FOR AT THE LIST IN ORDER TO BE CHOSEN. AND WE DID THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO BRING UP NEW VENDORS TO FIGURE OUT OUR SYSTEM THAT THEY BUILT- WE NEED TO DO TO ROLL SOMETHING OUT YOU KNOW AS- AS POSSIBLE. AND WE NEED WE PULLED IN ANY AND ALL VENDORS THAT WOULD HELP WITH THAT. BECAUSE WE'RE ARGUMENT TO MAKING SURE PEOPLE GETTING PAID NOW IF YOU DON'T LIKE TO LIGHT THAT'S- YOU KNOW I CAN'T HELP YOU THERE THAT'S NOT MY ISSUE BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE'RE TURNING AROUND SERVICES QUICKLY. FOR CALIFORNIA SO I FINALLY POINTED OUT BECAUSE YOU WERE THE ONE WHO JUST SAID A FEW MINUTES AGO THAT YOU HAVE A COMPETITIVE PROCESS AND THIS IS HOW YOU REVIEW YES AND NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A NON COMPETITIVE. BIDS BUT BUT BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF EATING THE MAJORITY OF THEM HAVE BEEN COMPETITIVE BID WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ONES JUST BUST RECENTLY. BUT DUE TO THE CRISIS ON THE AND A PANDEMIC- WE HAD TO TAKE EXTREME MEASURES BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE THEM I MEAN IT ONLY MAKES SENSE TO THE PEOPLE THAT BUILT THE SYSTEM. AND RIGHT YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK WHAT'S WHAT'S WHAT'S CURIOUS ABOUT THIS ENTIRE SITUATION IS AT DETROIT FOR THE BETTER PART OF A DECADE. HAS HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR AGENCY WHERE IT IS CONTINUE TO OVER CHARGE UNDER THE LIVER AND FRANKLY AND BET ITSELF AND FURTHER LONG TERM DEPENDENCE WITH WHAT HAS ANY BROKEN IT SYSTEM AND SO. FOR THE BETTER PART OF A TEN YEAR TEN YEARS WE'VE WE'VE HAD THIS EXPERIENCE AND YET IT HAS IT HAS CONTINUED AND WHICH IS NOT ONE ASPECT OF OUR PROCUREMENT PROCESS. GIVES CREDIT TO THOSE VENDORS WHO HAVE HAD LONG TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH GOVERNMENT WHICH I THINK IS MADE IT HARDER. FOR US TO EXTRICATE OURSELVES FROM FROM THIS RELATIONSHIP YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN CURIOUS SINCE I'VE BEEN DIGGING-INTO THIS I'VE LEARNED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT'S EXPERIENCE IN WORKING ON UNEMPLOYMENT AND OTHER STATES- YOU KNOW I'M ASSUMING. THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FLORIDA WITH DELIGHT. AND THEY'RE ON A POINT SYSTEM. THE FLORIDA GOVERNOR. HAD ORDERED INVEST. INTO HOW THEIR STATE COULD HAVE PAID SO. I PAID SO MUCH FOR SO LITTLE. I'LL JUST QUOTE ONE MORE LEFT IN THIS. DILUTES TRACK RECORD IS CHECKERED WITH NEGLIGENCE. PRODUCTS THAT WORK. I'M ASSUMING YOU'RE ALSO FAMILIAR WITH WHAT HAPPENED IN THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS. AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE WHITE AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT SYSTEM THERE. SO YOU KNOW I GUESS. WE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS- HI YOU KNOW IT MGHT BE APPROPRIATE TO BRING TO LIGHT TO A FUTURE HEARING. BECAUSE FROM OUR STANDPOINT FOR THE BETTER PART OF TEN YEARS. IT'S BEEN GROUNDHOG DAY WE'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE. LITERALLY TEN YEARS AGO. AND THERE'S BEEN FAILURE AFTER FAILURE AFTER FAILURE- I GUESS JUST TO END THIS SECTION I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ASK- THE SECRETARY THE HEAD OF THE STRIKE TEAM. MY HOPE IS THAT YOU ARE ANALYZING. EDIE'S CURRENT IT CONTRACTS AND- REVIEWING THE PROCUREMENT AND CONTRACTING PROCESS. AND AS WAS MENTIONED FOR BY OUR COLLEAGUES TO TALK TO OTHER. IT VENDORS AS PART OF THE REVIEW BECAUSE- ALONG WITH THAT ASSEMBLY. MEMBER COUNTY BEACH NORTH. I'VE CERTAINLY GOT AN AWFUL LOT OF INTERESTING FEEDBACK. FROM WITHIN GOVERNMENT AND OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT. ABOUT HOW CHALLENGING IT HAS BEEN. TO COLLABORATE WITH THE LAWYER TO ACTUALLY FIX EDT. AND I'M HEARING THIS EVERY DAY. SO IT'S JUST A IT'S A BIT BEFUDDLING TO MAY- THAT EDT LEADERSHIP CONTINUES TO DEFEND THAT RELATIONSHIP WHEN IT CLEARLY HAS NOT WORKED. AND IT'S COST THE STATE. OVER A QUARTER BILLION DOLLARS- LET ME LET ME JUST AND BY. POINTING OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT. WE ARE ALSO LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK FROM SOAP. IN OUR LETTER WE. WE MENTIONED A WHOLE NUMBER OF. BASIC CUSTOMER SERVICE. WE'RE HOPING SOME ANSWERS ON. WHETHER IT'S WHETHER IT'S POSSIBLE TO HAVE AUTOMATIC CALL BACK. FEATURES ON YOUR CALL CENTER HOW WE CAN PROVIDE WHICH ACCESS. HOW DO WE ENSURE REAL ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE HANG UPS. THAT AT THE LAST HEARING YOU SAID YOU WERE. YOU'RE NOT HEARD ABOUT BEFORE WHICH MY- COLLEAGUES AND I HEAR ABOUT EVERY DAY. HOW WE ANSWERED I WILL APOLOGIZE BECAUSE I DIDN'T HEAR PROPERLY LAST TIME YES I HAVE HEARD THAT COMPLAINT AND- WE CONTINUE TO DO TAKE MEASURES ARE AROUND QUALITY ASSURANCE WE TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY- SO- LET ME JUST SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT THERE BECAUSE I JUST DID NOT HEAR YOU CORRECTLY LAST TIME. OCCURS WHAT WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO CREATE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY IN THAT AREA. A NUMBER OF THINGS- WELL THAT'S WHY WE- CAME UP WITH A KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO HELP PROVIDE A BETTER DATA. BUT AND- WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE TRAINING- POLICY PROCEDURE UPDATES NEWSLETTERS WE'RE ALSO STARTING DISCUSSION WITH THE UNION TO TALK ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO LISTEN INTO CALLS SO WE COULD DO CAUGHT REAL TIME QUALITY ASSURANCE. SO THAT'S A DISCUSSION THAT'S GOING ON- I THINK THAT'S WHERE IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE HELPFUL- YOU KNOW WE CAN PROVIDE ALL THE TOOLS MATERIALS BUT IN ORDER TO LOOP AROUND TO DO THE COUNT ABILITY M. WE REALLY NEED TO- HAVE OUR MENTORS AND OUR MANAGERS BE ABLE TO CALL AND- THAT JOB LISTEN INTO SOME OF THE CALLS AND HELP STAFF. WITH IMPROVING ANY SERVICE ISSUES THERE MIGHT BE. THAT IS GOOD TO HEAR LOOK FORWARD GETTING MORE UPDATES ON ON THAT- HAVE YOU HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH ANY OF YOUR- WORKFORCE BOARDS AROUND THE STATE WHO I KNOW. MANY OF WHOM ARE DOING A LOT OF WORK OUTSIDE EDT TO ASSESS THE SITUATION- HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT REGIONAL LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH. LOCAL WORKFORCE BOARDS. WELL PART OF OUR WORKFORCE SERVICES BRANCH- AND THE- THE- THE BOARD- WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH ALL THE PARTNERSHIPS AND- YOU KNOW THAT'S PART OF WHAT I WAS SAYING WORK WORKING ON TRYING TO. MOVE PEOPLE THAT WE RE DIRECTED TO YOU AYE BACK SOME OF THE PROGRAMS AND A BIG EMPHASIS IS IN OUR WORK FORCE SERVICES BRANCH. BECAUSE WE NEED TO YOU KNOW AS WE START PIVOTING TOWARDS UNEMPLOYMENT TO REEMPLOYMENT WE NEED THEM- OUT IN THE REGIONAL AREAS WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY WORKING WITH THE PARTNERS. AND ESTABLISHING ALL NEW WAYS ON HOW TO HELP PEOPLE GET BACK IN FLOYD. SO ABSOLUTELY THAT'S A VERY STRONG PARTNERSHIP THAT'S THE WHOLE- WORK FIRST- HOW IT OPERATES AS A PARTNERSHIP. I'M NOT SURE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EXACTLY THE SAME THING BUT THERE ASYOU PROBABLY KNOW THERE'S A CONSOLATION OF WORKS LOCAL WORKFORCE BOARDS. THAT WORK WITH CITY AND COUNTY AND NONPROFIT AND PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS AND YEAH WHAT I HAVE HEARD IS MANY OF THEM ARE STRIVING AROUND THE CLOCK TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE. TO LOCAL REGIONAL CONSTITUENTS ON DVD AND THEY WOULD LIKE TO WORK MORE DEEPLY WITH YOUR AGENCY AND FRANKLY JUST IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN CHALLENGING SO- I'D LOVE TO GET AN UPDATE ON HOW THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE GOING. ON LISTEN. OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE MANY ASPECTS OF OUR LETTER THAT WE HAVE NOT. HEARD RESPONSES ON AND IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE COULD. RECEIVE SOME INFORMATION ON THAT WRITTEN RESPONSES ON WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE DIFFERENT PROPOSALS WE HAVE. I THINK THE LAST THING I pSECRETARY WHO'S HELPING TO HEAD UP THE STRIKE FORCE TEAM. MY REAL CONCERN ABOUT THE STRIKE FOUR SEPARATE IS THAT IT'S GOING TO AND- MID SEPTEMBER- AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE THINKS THAT WE CAN TURN THE TITANIC AROUND. IN FORTY FIVE DAYS THE EDT STRIKE FORCE WAS MODELED AFTER. THE TURNAROUND REQUIRED AT THE DMV WHICH TOOK SIX MONTHS OF ENGAGEMENT. SO IF I CANNOT A LOT TO ASK THE SECRETARY- IF. SHE HAS THOUGHTS ON. HOW TO ENSURE THAT AFTER FORTY FIVE DAYS WHATEVER THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE WILL TRULY BE IMPLEMENTED TO CHANGE PRACTICES. CULTURE IT SYSTEMS AND SORT OF MOVE FOR LEADERSHIP THAT THAT IMPLEMENTS SYSTEMIC REFORM. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S GREAT AND IF THERE'S NO ANSWER TO THAT THIS MOMENT YOU KNOW IT CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE'D LOVE TO HEAR AND IN IN A COUPLE WEEKS WHEN THAT REPORT COMES UP. I WILL LEAD TO- IN ADDITION THE STRIKE TEAM THAT'S WHY GOVERNOR NEWSOM- MADE SURE THAT I HAVE. THAT EXECUTIVE STAFF THAT I NEED. LIKE I SAID I JUST INTRODUCED CARL WILLIAMS A NEW CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR. OF BEGINNING A SECOND CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR IN SEPTEMBER A GENERAL COUNSEL IN SEPTEMBER. AS WELL AS- A LEADS DIRECTOR JUST STARTED. AND OR AGENCY- JUST HIRED A ALLEGE POLICY PERSON TO ASSISTANCE AS WELL. SO I'D I'M GONNA SAY AGAIN I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE FOR ALL OF THE SUPPORT THAT WE'RE GETTING- YOU KNOW FRANKLY IT'S BEEN A HANDFUL OF US SORT OF TRYING TO KEEP. EVERYTHING AFLOAT AND- YEAH IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THE DIGITAL RESOURCES IN THE TEAM THAT IS TRULY NEEDED. IN ORDER TO MOVE THIS DEPARTMENT WHO'S WHAT'S IS GOING TO BE. WELL OVER TEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES NOW. TO THE NEXT LEVEL SO. I IT'S GREAT WE'RE IN WE'RE GOING THE RIGHT DIRECTION. GREAT AND THE AB TWO TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS GO THEY'RE ABLE TO JOIN TEAM AND PRE THEIR WILLINGNESS TO STEP INTO. THESE THESE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES SO WITH THAT MISTER. MISTER NAZARIAN. THANK YOU MISTER I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THE POINT OF- THAT THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED BY MY PREVIOUS TO COLLEAGUES AND IT SURE AS WELL. BECAUSE IT'S VERY SIMILAR BUT I WANTED TO JUST FOCUS ON- FOR AREAS- QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS ONE IS- I DO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE MR CHU BRINGING UP THE SPECIFICS OF THE NUMBERS I WAS LISTENING TO THE NUMBERS YOU WERE REPORTING. AND HOW IT'S GONE DOWN FROM I BELIEVE THAT I EVEN HEARD SIXTEEN MILLION AT SOME POINT. DOWN TO FIVE POINT ONE MILLION. BUT YOU KNOW THOSE THOSE NUMBERS AS- GREAT AS THEY ARE IN PROVIDING US. AN OVERALL SENSE. THAT'S THE HEADLINE THAT'S WHAT CAPTURES THE HEADLINE. THEN IT'S THE REST OF THE DETAILS THAT COUNT IN ORDER FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PRECISION IS NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES. IF I DON'T SEE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THOSE CALLS ARE REPEAT CALLS. IF IT. I DON'T KNOW HOW OTHER ASSEMBLY OR SENATE OFFICES FUNCTION BUT JUST IN OUR OFFICE WHAT I'D LIKE STAFF TO DO IS EVERY TIME A CONSTITUENT CALLS I WANT THAT TO BE INPUT INTO OUR LCMS SYSTEM. BECAUSE I WANT TO BE ABLE TO KNOW WHAT EVERY SINGLE CONSTITUENTS CONCERNED HAS BEEN. IF I'M EVER GONNA SPEAK TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE ISSUES HAVE BEEN THAT WE'VE HELPED THEM ON. OF WHAT THEIR CONCERNS HAVE BEEN AND WHAT THE GENERAL THINKING IS. IF I'M DOING THAT ON THE BASIS OF THE SMALL OPERATION I HAVE AND I ONLY HAVE TEN STAFFERS THAT CAN HELP ME IN DOING THIS. AS A AND I APOLOGIZE ACTUALLY FIVE STAFFERS BECAUSE MY DISTRICT OFFICE IS HOVERS BETWEEN FOUR TO FIVE STAFFERS. I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED THAT AN AGENCY LIKE EDT. WOULD HAVE THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE. TO BE ABLE TO CAPTURE ALL OF THIS DATA SO THAT YOU CAN CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE. HOW YOU'RE DELIVERING THOSE SERVICES. SO I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE JUST BEING KEPT IN THE DARK. AS YOU'RE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH ISSUES. OR IF YOU REALLY DON'T COLLECT THAT DATA AND NOW YOU'VE STARTED JUST TO HAVE TO COLLECT DATA BECAUSE THERE WAS SERIES OF HARSH QUESTIONS COMING YOUR WAY. BUT YEAH THE DATA SUGGESTS EVERYTHING IT COMMUNICATES EVERYTHING IT HELPS RESOLVE MANY ISSUES YOU KNOW THIS. SO WHAT I WOULD PROPOSE IS AS WE'RE HOLDING THESE HEARINGS I WOULD ASK THE CHAIR AND THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE FOR US TO ACTUALLY COME IN ON A MONTHLY BASIS. EVEN WHEN WE'RE OUT OF SESSION AND PREFERABLY IN. PHYSICALLY BE HERE RATHER THAN TO DO WITH THE RESUME CALL. TO CONTINUE ASKING FOR QUESTIONS AND MAYBE. OKAY I'M SORRY CONTINUE TO GET UPDATES FROM YOU BUT ALSO MAYBE WE CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH QUICK QUESTIONS MORE DETAILED QUESTIONS OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ASKING FOR SO THAT ON A MONTHLY BASIS WE GET THOSE UPDATES. SO THAT. WE DON'T HAVE. MISCOMMUNICATION OR MISSED OPPORTUNITY SO EVERY MONTH WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE ASKING AND GETTING. THAT WOULD BE ONE THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. GOOD THANK YOU TO UNDER THE LAW ISSUE I. WHAT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO KNOW IS DO YOU GET INVITED. TO VARIOUS TECH COMPANIES OR CONSULTANTS WOULD GO UP. DO YOU GET INVITED TO TOWARDS OF VARIOUS COMPANIES WHO PROVIDE SERVICES. OR HAVE INTEGRATIVE SYSTEMS THAT THEY OFFER AND WORK WITH STATES TO. SEE WHAT IS WHAT ADVANCEMENTS ARE TAKING PLACE IN THE MARKET PLACE. HOW DO OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD YOU KNOW HOW MANY TOWARDS YOU'VE GONE ON OR HOW MANY UP HOW MANY DIFFERENT. PROGRAMS YOU'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO INTERACT WITH OUR VISIT. IT FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE BENEFIT OF SYSTEMS- WE DID EXTENSIVE- MARKET RESEARCH AND- WE- MATT WITH AND DID A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND MATT WHERE THAT SAY ALL SEVEN EIGHT UP MAJOR VENDORS IN THE U. Y. A. D. I. ROUND. AND HAD- COMPREHENSIVE OF DEMONSTRATIONS OF THEIR SYSTEMS- AND THEN WHEN WE WENT OUT TO BID WE MADE SURE THAT ALL THOSE VENDORS THAT. THE OUT THERE THEY WERE WELL AWARE OF OUR PROCUREMENT AND- AT YOU KNOW INVITED THEM TO BID. OUT TO ENSURE WE HAD A GREAT POOL OF VENDORS TO SELECT FROM- AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE DID WE'RE JUST IN THE PROCESS OF THE NARROWING IT DOWN AND HOPE TO. YOU KNOW. COME UP WITH A VENDOR SOON DIRECTOR OF PROCUREMENT PROCESS WHICH I APPRECIATE THAT BUT BUT AGAIN BUT I'M TRYING TO ASK IS NOT JUST WHEN YOU'RE IN THE PROCESS OF. HAVING TO FIND A VENDOR. MY QUESTION IS. AS TECHNOLOGY CHANGES AS YOU MAINTAINING DATA AND YOU SEE THAT THE NEEDS OF YOUR AGENCY ARE CHANGING. THEE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPLORE AND SEE WHAT PRODUCTS THERE ARE IN THE MARKET SPACE AND HOW HOW IT CAN BETTER HELP YOUR- PROGRAMS VERSES THE ONE YOU MAY BE EMPLOYING RIGHT NOW. SO WHAT WHAT ARE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AND I OBVIOUSLY I THINK I DON'T WANT THE LEGISLATURE TO BE TRUE ENGAGED IN SOME OF THAT PROCESS BUT AGAIN AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM MANY OF THE PANELISTS HERE. WE ARE APPROACHED AND WE ARE OFFERED THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW THINGS CAN IMPROVE AND SO WHAT WHEN OU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS I SUSPECT THAT YOU GET APPROACHED ON A MUCH MORE FREQUENT BASIS. AND YET NONE OF THOSE. APPROACHES HAVE YIELDED A CHANGE IN WHO WE HAVE BEEN EMPLOYING AS A STATE OR AS A DEPARTMENT. IN THE LAST TEN YEARS SO. SOMETHING HAS BEEN VERY COMPELLING ABOUT THIS ONE COMPANY. YET THEY HAVE TIME AND TIME AGAIN NOT BEEN ABLE TO DELIVER. I'M JUST TRYING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND A- DO WE TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF LEARNING AND BEING OPEN TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE MARKET SPACE NOT JUST DURING THE TIMES THAT WE'RE EVALUATING A CONTRACT. TO IT'S JUST INTERESTING TO ME WHY A COMPANY THAT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO DELIVER CONTINUES TO BE REWARDED BUT I THINK WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA BE ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT ON AN ONGOING BASIS. SO. WOULD YOU CARE TO COMMENT. YEAH SO WE USE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT VENDORS FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SERVICES- THAT PRIOR CHAU- MET WITH VENDORS EVERY MONTHS TO LOOK AT THE LATEST- TECHNOLOGY WHAT THEY THEY BRING- JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS WERE USING DOCUSIGN WERE USING- AND OUTSIDE VENDORS THROUGH C. D. T. IN ODI RECOMMENDATION FOR OUR CERTIFICATION REGISTER VACATIONS- WE'VE GOT A WHOLE HOST OF VENDORS I MEAN OUR SYSTEM ISN'T JUST. WHAT THE LATE BRING TO THE TABLE OUR SYSTEM AS A WHOLE HOST OF A BOLT ON SYSTEMS FROM NUMEROUS VENDORS THAT MAKE IT ALL WORK AND THAT'S PART OF THE BIG PROBLEM I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN WITH THE LIGHT BUT I WILL ALSO SAY THEY GAVE US THEY BUILT A SYSTEM WHICH WAS A BUILT ON SYSTEM BASED ON WHAT AT THAT TIME. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WANTED TO DO AND WHICH WAS ONLY DO A PARTIAL REPLACEMENT I WOULD NEVER YOU KNOW AT THAT TIME TECHNOLOGY WISE I DON'T KNOW THAT WE THE ENVIRONMENT WAS ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT A PARTIAL REPLACEMENT DOES. BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY YOU KNOW WHY WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL THE WHOLESALE REPLACEMENT TO MAKE SURE WE GET AWAY FROM ALL THESE MULTAN'S- SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE TO PIECE TOGETHER IN ORDER TO MAKE UP THE U. I. SYSTEM AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING STAYS IN SYNC. SO THEY. WERE GIVEN A TACIT WASN'T. IN IN MY IT. PROBABLY THE BEST STRATEGY BUT THAT'S WHAT WE KNEW AT THE TIME OR THAT THE LEAST THE LEADERS AT THE TIME. THEY JUST THOUGHT THAT- DOING A SMALLER TECHNOLOGY. ROSS SAYS- YOU KNOW WE'RE SOLUTION WAS A BETTER SITUATION THAN DOING A WHOLE A WHOLE LIST OF CHANGE AND I THINK WITH A LESSON LEARNED WE'VE ALL LEARNED. THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT THE WAY TO GO YOU LOSE THE BENEFIT OF A MODERNIZE SYSTEM THAT WORKS HOLISTICALLY- AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID WITH OUR TAX ACCOUNTING SYSTEM AND OUR TAX AREA. WE DID A WHOLESALE REPLACEMENT AND WE SEEN THE BENEFITS OF IT AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHY WE WERE LOOKING TO DO IT FOR OUR BENEFITS SYSTEM SO WE CAN. HAVE THE SAME SUCCESS IN OUR BENEFIT ROUND THAT WE HAD IN OUR TAX AROUND. SO ANYWAY YES WE'RE WE'RE USING IDEALIZING VENDORS ALL THE TIME THEIR NEW INNOVATIONS AND- SCREENING THE MARKET- I KNEW CHAU- TO START IN MARCH IS- FANTASTIC. AND IT BROUGHT EVEN MORE AND MORE IDEAS TO THE TABLE- WHICH HAS BEEN VERY EXCITING. BUT YEAH. TO LAST I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU A LITTLE WHILE AGO WHEN YOU WERE ANSWERING ONE OF THE QUESTIONS- HE SAID THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE A QUESTION ABOUT. WHAT WE LOOK LIKE MOVING FORWARD. AND SO I WANT TO ASK YOU. GIVEN ALSO THESE NUMBERS GIVEN ALSO ALL THE HIRINGS THAT YOU ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN. YOU KNOW THERE'S A VERY. THERE'S BEEN A DELAYED RAMP UP AND A LOT OF THE CONCERNS HAVE HAVE THAT. HAVE LED TO NOW THIS RAMP UP WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE HOPED THAT THE DEMAND WOULD HAVE BEEN MET. BUT THERE'S BEEN A DELAY VERY DELAYED MEETING OF THE DEMAND AND THERE'S BEEN QUITE A BIT OF HIRING OF NEW STAFF. NOW AT SOME POINT AS THE CONCERNS DECRESCENDO AND THAT MIGHT BE. SOMETIME AWAY BECAUSE I THINK THE WORST OF THIS RECESSION IS YET TO HIT. WHAT IS. WHAT'S WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR EDT MOVING FORWARD ARE WE JUST GOING TO HAVE A HIGHER LOAD OF EMPLOYEES IS IT ALL GOING TO SUBSIDE AT SOME POINT OR WHAT DOES THE AGENCY LOOK LIKE AND THIS IS OBVIOUSLY AN ONGOING COMIC THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION BUT I FEEL LIKE IT'S IMPORTANT TO BRING IT UP BECAUSE- WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE- OF THE SHORTNESS. OF THE ELECTED OFFICIALS LIMITS. TERM LIMITS. OR WHATEVER ELSE IS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR- IT IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE ISSUES. THE EIGHT INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY SUPPORTS THERE BEING LONG TERM DISCUSSIONS OF HOW THE ISSUES GET RESOLVED. SO IF ANYTHING I WANT THIS TO BE THE START TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU TELL US WHAT YOU WANT TO LOOK LIKE AND LAST TIME WE ESTABLISHED YOU YOU'VE BEEN. EVEN WITH THIS INSTITUTION A VERY LONG TIME SO HOW WHERE ARE THE CHANGES YOU SEE. THAT NEEDS TO BE IMPLEMENTED FOR THE AGENCY MOVING FORWARD. I WOULDN'T MIND IF YOU OFFER SOME THOUGHTS RIGHT NOW AND WE CAN CONTINUE TALKING. DEFINITELY I MEAN AT WHAT I'D LOVE TO SEE THE CUT THE CALL CENTER BE RESPONDING TO EVERYBODY THAT NEEDS HELP. I WOULD LOVE TO USE EVERY FEATURE IN TECHNOLOGY THERE IS OUT THERE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE DIFFERENT- VEHICLES AND AVENUES FOR SERVICE. I LIKE ALL OF OUR INFORMATION TO BE IS CLEAR AND UNDERSTANDABLE AND DIGESTIBLE BY ALL WHICH IS IT A HUGE CHALLENGE GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE FEDERAL PROGRAM. IT JUST SEEMS TO GET MORE AND MORE COMPLEX. SO I'D YOU KNOW I WANT TO BE A DIRECTOR OF A DEPARTMENT WHERE MY STAFF. ARE SO PROUD OF THE SERVICES WERE PROVIDING BECAUSE WE KNOW WE'RE GIVING THAT TOP NOT SERVICE TO CALIFORNIANS. THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO BE AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH THE HELP OF A CD T. ODI THE STRIKE TEAM. THE GOVERNOR ADDITIONAL APPOINTEES- IT TAKES MANPOWER AND IT TAKES- GOOD PEOPLE AT THE TABLE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AND THE WILLINGNESS TO FIND IT. SO I THINK YOU KNOW IT'S NOT GOOD THAT WERE IN THE LIMELIGHT BUT BEING IN THE LIMELIGHT DOES A PRESENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR GREAT GREAT IMPROVEMENT. SO MAYBE THAT'S NOT THE WAY YOU WANT TO DO IT BUT IT IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY STRIVE AND MAKE CHANGES AND GREAT PARTNERSHIP SO. I WELCOME IT. WE NEED TO BE DIFFERENT. MY COMMENTS ARE PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS ONCE BEFORE AND I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT I THINK MOST OF US WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT WHAT ARE STATE WAS CHALLENGED WITH OVER A LITTLE OVER TEN YEARS AGO. WOULD HAVE PREPARED US IN DEALING WITH WHAT. THE ONSLAUGHT OF WHAT HAPPENED THIS YEAR. AND WE WERE EXTREMELY ILL PREPARED AND SO- IT. OBVIOUSLY YOU ARE IN THE LIMELIGHT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME. IT MOVING FORWARD I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS. THIS I'M GLAD THAT THE STRIKE FORCE IS GONNA HELP BUT YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL AS THE HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT AND AS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN WITH THIS DEPARTMENT FOR A VERY LONG TIME THE SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN WITH THE STATE FOR A VERY LONG TIME. I'D BE INTERESTED TO KNOW WHAT YOUR SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS ARE AND I'M HAPPY TO. FOR IT TO BE SOMETHING THAT YOU START DISCUSSING YOU REVEAL AT OUR NEXT HEARING SO THAT MOVING FORWARD WE KNOW WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE. TOUCH TO MAKE APPROPRIATE IMPLEMENT CHANGES AND IMPLEMENTATIONS IN PLACE YEAH SO WITH THAT THANK YOU CAN START ONE I WOULD LIKE TO ADD ONE THING AS FAR AS OUR PREPAREDNESS I'M GOING INTO WHEN THE PANDEMIC CARE ACT. IF WE WEREN'T WHERE WE WERE- IN FEBRUARY WITH ALL THE TECHNOLOGY CHANGES ENHANCEMENT OF COMMUNICATION IMPROVEMENTS THERE IS NO WAY WE WOULD'VE MADE THE PAYMENTS WE'VE BEEN MAKING IF WE WORSE IF WE LOOK LIKE WE DID TEN YEARS AGO. WE WOULD HAVE IMPLODED THERE IS NO WAY WE COULD PROVIDE THE SERVICE THAT THAT YOU'RE GETTING ON YOU MAY NOT LOVE THE LEVEL I DON'T BUT- AT THE SAME TIME WITH PAID OUT BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THE TIP TO OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT NEED IT. SO YES- WERE WE READY TO BE HIT BY A PANDEMIC NO BUT WHO US AND- YOU KNOW AGAIN WE MADE SUCH A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS THE ONLY REASON WE ARE SURVIVING IS FOR EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE DONE. THE LAST TEN YEARS SO. YEAH I WAS GONNA LEAVE IT AT THAT LAST COMMENT BUT GIVEN THAT YOU SAID THIS MISS HILLARD. I CAN NAME YOU. BY FIRST NAMES. MY CONSTITUENTS WHO HAVE CALLED WHO. I KNOW FIRST HAND THAT WE'VE ALREADY HELPED. AND YET THEY'RE CALLING BACK AGAIN. SAYING THAT EVEN AFTER OUR INITIAL HELP AND THEIR INITIAL PAYMENT THEY'RE STILL FALLING INTO A AREA WHERE THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE SUPPORT NEEDED MOVING FORWARD SO RIGHT WHEN YOU TELL ME THAT. THESE PROBLEMS WE'RE IN A BETTER PLACE THAT THESE PROBLEMS WERE ADDRESSED WHY IS IT THAT INDIVIDUALS WHERE OUR OFFICES HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN. PROMOTING THEIR ISSUE. AND BRINGING IT TO THE FOREFRONT ARE STILL CONTINUING TO HAVE PROBLEMS SO YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE AND IT'S NOT JUST ME SAYING THIS WHEN YOU HEAR IT FROM MULTIPLE PEOPLE IT REALLY ERODES THE CONFIDENCE. ON BUT YOU'RE BASING YOUR- ARGUMENTS. I TOTALLY HEAR YOU AND I AGREE IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE SO I'M JUST IN THE MASS. WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH HAS BEEN- QUITE INCREDIBLE BUT IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH WE KNOW THAT AND- OUR SYSTEMS NEED TO BE A WHOLE NEW LEVEL. BUT I AGREE. WOOD MISTER NAZARIAN ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. I DON'T THINK ALL THE PANELS FOR THE PARTICIPATION. WE DON'T HAVE ANY ANY PUBLIC SPEAKERS HERE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ON THE TOPIC. PLEASE GO FORWARD. YOU'RE NOT HOT YET COULD LIKE TURN ON PLEASE. OKAY GREAT GOOD MORNING MISTER TURNER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE NAVNEET BEEN DAHLE ON BEHALF OF S. LOCAL ONE THOUSAND WE REPRESENT MEMBERS WHO WORK AT E. D. D. WHO WANTED TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT OVER THE PHONE. BUT SINCE THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE THEY ASKED THAT I COME HERE AND STAND. MANY OF OUR MEMBERS ARE WORKING TWELVE HOUR SHIFTS AND ON WEEKENDS TO PROCESS THE HISTORIC LEVEL A DELIGHT CLAIMS INCLUDING THE CLAIMS OF YOUR MEMBERS. FOR YEARS NOW WE'VE BEEN RAISING THE ALARM BELLS REGARDING UNDER STAFFING AND OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY AT ET D. WITHOUT ANY REAL ANSWERS. UNFORTUNATELY A TOOK A PANDEMIC TO GET THE BALL ROLLING. AS MUCH AS PEOPLE WALK PAST SOLUTIONS WE KNOW CONTRACTING OUT DOES NOT WORK. EIGHT YEAR OLD LOW PERFORMING WORKERS. WHO ARE UNDER TRAINED AND UNDERPAID THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH- VERSION OF FOR THE SPEAKERS IN THE ROOM I'M TOLD ON THE PHONE LINES IN THE REMOTE ROOM THERE ARE NO PUBLIC SPEAKERS- SO THAT DRAWS TO A CONCLUSION YOU KNOW I'M SOMEONE ENCOURAGED BY SOME OF THE STEPS TAKEN BUT WE STILL A LONG WAYS TO GO- WE PUT A HAVING HEARING NEXT MONTH WILL REACH OUT TO MY COLLEAGUE TO SEE WHETHER WE- DO IT HERE- ZOOM I THINK. SEMESTERS THERE IN AND THANK A HEARING HERE IS MUCH MORE IMPACTFUL THAN DOING SOON SO WE'LL REACH OUT SEE WHAT THE COVERING DO IT ANYWAYS- THANK YOU ALL AND HAVE A GOOD DAY THIS MEETINGS ADJOURNED.
