LAYING SO FROM THE **** CITY I AM STRONGLY OPPOSED TO FOURTEEN TEN. THE TERM AT THE TIME WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN Q. THANK YOU- MATTER MODERATOR MISTER WHITE CASKEY WOULD LIKE TO. WAIT A NICE HERE HAND UP. YES MISTER CHAIR I HAVE A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR OVER THE ON THE BILL. IF WE'RE DONE WITH THE PUBLIC HEARING WE ARE BRINGING IT BACK TO OUR MEMBERS THANK YOU. CENTER BRADFORD THE THIS GRAHAM ONLY COVERS UNPAID RENT THAT'S A CRUDE UP TO THE ENDING OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY THE CURRENT STATE OF EMERGENCY THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE CONCERNED THAT. WE MAY. CALL ALL CLEAR AND THEN FIND OUT THAT THE PANDEMIC ACTUALLY USING IT CONTINUE SIR UP OCCUR ARE SIR ANY CONDUCT. CONTINGENCY FOR- BY I GUESS THE REOCCUR ARE A RE STATE REINSTATEMENT OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY WITH THE SAME PANDEMIC THAT WE'RE FACING NOW. AND THAT'S A GREAT CONCERN THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP AS RELATES NOT ONLY TO HOUSING BUT THE HEALTH CARE AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE'RE FACING HERE IF. THERE'S A RECURRENCE THIS BILL DOES NOT HAVE A RESET BUT IT LOOKS AT THE CONTINUING ONGOING CRISIS SO YOU HAVE SIX MONTHS FROM THE TIME. OF THE CRISIS STARTED TO WAVER RANT AND IF IT IS EXTENDED ON BE BEYOND THAT POINT- THE TENANT CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT AGAIN. OKAY IN IN THE FOLLOW UP QUESTION MISTER CHAIR IS THAT WE HAVE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THAT'S NOT GOING TO ALLOW ANY UNLAWFUL DETAINER HEARINGS HERE. WE'VE GOT THIS THE- THE CRISIS THE STATE OF EMERGENCY ENDING- IF THE PARTIES AGREE BECAUSE THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM I HEARD A LOT OF UP OPPOSITION BUT THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM. IF THE PARTIES AGREE AND WE HAVE WE'RE A LITTLE BIT OVER IN THE WITH THE STATE OF EMERGENCY ENDED BUT THEY'VE AGREED THAT THEY'LL TAKE THE RENT. IS THERE A CONDITION THAT THIS FRANCHISE-TAX BOARD WILL ALLOW THAT VOLUNTARY REPAYMENT PERIOD TO GO ONE IT'S STILL WITHIN THE SIX MONTH PERIOD BUT IT SAID. THAT HARD STOP AT THE STATE OF EMERGENCY AND THAT'S WHAT- THE BILL STATES RIGHT NOW WE'RE NEGOTIATIONS THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO SEE WHAT ROLE THEY'RE WILLING TO PLAY. AN EXTENDING THAT PERIOD BUT YES WE LOOKED AT THOSE PROVISIONS AND IS MEASURE TO INVOLVED- FRENCH I SELF FOR TO EXIST. WITH THIS PROCESS THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION MISTER CHAIR AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I'LL MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS I SEE MISS BATES FOR THEIR HAND UP GO AHEAD. I TALK ON THE- MMHM IF IT ON THE MICROPHONE YEAH. IT IS THERE'S A THE BILL HAS A BLANK AND IT IS REYES LIT UP THE MICROPHONE YOU GO CAN HEAR ME YEP. THE BILL HAS A BLANK IN IT IT'S A CRITICAL PIECE OF INFORMATION MISSING WHICH IS THE NUMBER OF DAYS WILL FOR WHICH RAN COULD BE DEFERRED SO THERE'S NO WAY TO TELL HOW MUCH RENT WOULD BE DEFERRED AND HOW MUCH THE TAX CREDITS WOULD COST THE STATE. I I'M I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY THAT EXISTS IN THE IN THE BILL. IN EUROPE WHICH IS. WHICH REFERENCE I CAN HEAR WHAT WOULD YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION. WELL YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT SORRY OF. THERE'S A BLANK IN THE BILL. A BLANK WHICH OF DOESN'T TELL THE NUMBER OF DAYS FOR WHICH RANT CAN BE DEFERRED IN AT FAULT WITHOUT THAT INFORMATION THERE'S NO WAY TO TELL HOW MUCH RENT WOULD BE DEFERRED HOW MUCH RENT WOULD BE DEFERRED AND HOW MUCH THE TAX CREDITS WOULD COST THE STATE THE OF REFERENCE IN THE BILL I JUST HAVE IT ON MY DIGEST HERE BUT IT THAT SPECIFICALLY COMES UNDER. PROHIBITION OF UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTIONS IT PROVIDE PROHIBITS ANY DEMAND FOR UNPAID RENT ACCRUED DURING THE COLD AT NINETEEN STATE OF EMERGENCY AND BLANK DAYS THEREAFTER EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED ARM FURTHER PROHIBITS ANY NOTICE TERMINATING TENDENCY INCLUDING FOR THOSE AGAINST MOBILE HOME PARK TENNIS FOR UNPAID RANCH THAT ACCRUED AND CONDUCT THAT OCCURRED DURING THE- BOB. STATE OF EMERGENCY AND BLANK DAYS THEREAFTER I'M ASSUMING THAT MIGHT HAVE TO DO WITH. HOW LONG THE EMERGENCY. EXISTS BUT TO HAVE IT OPEN IN THE BILL THE QUESTION IS THAT GOING TO BE PART OF. AN AGREEMENT THAT THE TENANT AND THE OWNER SIGN THAT OWNER UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT WOULD ONLY BE FILLED IN WHEN YOU HAVE THE ANSWER. OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT COULDN'T BE AFFECTED. BOB PRIOR TO US HAVING THE STATE OF EMERGENCY ARE TERMINATED. I THINK IT'S VERY CONFUSING. ALL I THINK IT MAINTENANCE TO THE QUESTION THAT ARE SENATOR FROM FREMONT WAS ASKING BECAUSE THERE'S AN EXTENSION OF THIS CRISIS WE BELIEVE THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LANDLORD AND THE TENANT TO NEGOTIATE IN EXTEND. BEYOND LET'S SAY A SET SIX MONTHS PERIOD AGAIN. THIS BILL IS RETROACTIVE TO THE POINT OF WHEN THE CRISIS STARTED IF I RUNNER HAS HAD A HARDSHIP AND YES AND IF IT EXTENDS BEYOND THAT SIX MONTHS IT LEAVES THE FLEXIBILITY TO EXTEND THE PROGRAM. BEYOND THAT POINT. BUT AS FAR AS THE HEART COST OF THAT. I CAN'T ANSWER THAT RIGHT NOW THAT'S PART OF THE ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS ARE WHAT THIS WILL COST BUT WE'VE ESTIMATED- A FEW HUNDRED- I THINK IT'S- ABOUT. ROUGHLY FEW MILLION- THE FIRST YEAR STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FOUR. THANK YOU MISTER JONES HAD A QUESTION AS WELL YES WELL I WAS JUST ONE MORE I TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF THE BILL WOULD PROHIBIT EVICTIONS. PROHIBITIVE ACTIONS ON REQUEST FOR PAYMENT OF OVERDUE RANT FOR ALL LANDLORDS WHETHER OR NOT THEY PARTICIPATED IN IN THE AGREEMENT. I UNDERSTAND THIS IS PROBABLY A WORK IN PROGRESS OF SOME OF THESE MIGHT BE. YOU KNOW TIGHTENED UP BUT THAT I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER. QUESTION ALL PART OF THE BILL THAT'S NOT CLEARLY DEFINED THE OBVIOUSLY THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS TO CREATE A THIRD PARTY VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT. ARE THE STATE AND THE TENANT- AND YOU HAVE TO OPT INTO THE PROGRAM SO. MISTER BRADFORD- OBVIOUSLY IF THERE IS A DRAFTING. ERROR THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY PACKAGE- AND SO THE QUESTIONS ARE DULY NOTED IN WILL BE- EVALUATED TO SEE IF IT'S A- DRAFTING ENSURE CLARITY ISSUE. AND IF I CAN SPEAK TO THE VICTIM PART THIS IS NOT PREVENT A LANDLORD FROM EXERCISING TRADITIONAL. EVICTION PROCESS IF. THE SITUATION WARRANTS THAT TO THAT DOESN'T PREVENT THAT AND IT DOESN'T INVOLVE ANY LANDLORD WHO IS NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM AT ALL SO THEY CAN STILL CARRY OUT THEIR TYPICAL UNLAWFUL DETAINER INFECTION NOTICES AS- IF THIS BILL DIDN'T EXIST FOR THOSE THEY'RE NOT PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROGRAM. ALL RIGHT MISTER JONES HAD A QUESTION YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT- I'M FOLLOWING UP ON SENATOR BATES QUESTION THAT I SEE SOME MEMBERS TRYING TO FIND THOSE BLANK LINES THESE THEY START ON PAGE FIVE. OF THE TEXT OF THE BILL THAT WAS ALSO ONE OF MY CONCERNS- AND I YOU KNOW. I THINK ONE OF THE COMMENTS MADE WAS. IN ANSWERING CENTER BATES QUESTIONS WE DON'T KNOW YET. HOW MUCH TIS IS GOING TO COST. I WOULD REMIND ALL OF US ON THIS COMMITTEE THAT THIS IS THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO KNOW HOW MUCH BILLS COST. BEFORE THEY LEAVE THIS COMMITTEE. AND GO TO THE FLOOR SO I THINK THAT THAT'S A GOOD REASON TO HOLD THIS BILL IN COMMITTEE FOR RIGHT NOW- I DO WANT TO. COMPLEMENT THE- THE AUTHORS OF THE BILL. YOU KNOW THIS IS A PRETTY SIMPLE PROBLEM. OF FOLKS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE A HARD TIME PAYING RENT- BECAUSE OF THE CO BID. AND THE GOVERNMENT- REQUIRE SHUT DOWN OF OUR ECONOMY. AND THIS IS A VERY CREATIVE. WAY TO SOLVE A VERY SIMPLE PROBLEM THE PROBLEM WITH THE WITH THE VERY CREATIVE SOLUTION IS A LOT OF HOLES IN IT AS HAS ALREADY BEEN POINTED OUT- BY OUR GOOD CALLING FROM ORANGE COUNTY BUT YOU KNOW THE SOME OTHER CONCERNS THAT I HAVE ABOUT THE BILL IS. IT ALLOWS FOR THE FEDERAL TAX BOARD- TO BURKE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO READ READ RECEIVE INTEREST IF THE LANDLORD OWES THEM MONEY. BUT THE LANDLORD IS NOT RECEIVING INTEREST IF THE LANDLORD IS OWED MONEY. ANOTHER PROBLEM THAT I SEE WITH THE BILL THAT I THINK SHOULD CONCERN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US ON THE COMMITTEE HERE IS WE ARE OBLIGATING FUTURE LEGISLATURE'S- TO ACT ON ON THIS BILL- IN APPROPRIATIONS. AND ONE OF THE ASPECTS OF THE BILL IS UPON APPROACH APPROPRIATION OF THE LEGISLATURE THE CREDIT MAY BE REFUNDED. SO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF WE APPROVE THIS TODAY AND WE'RE OBLIGATING FUTURE LEGISLATURE'S IN THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR BEYOND. AND THEY JUST DECIDE YOU KNOW WHAT WE DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENED IN TWENTY TWENTY. I HAVE FOR THOSE LEGISLATORS ARE GONE. OR FOR WHATEVER VARIOUS REASONS- WE'RE JUST NOT GONNA APPROPRIATED. SO HOW HOW ARE WE GIVING. CONFIDENCE TO THE LANDLORDS OR EVEN THE- FRANCHISE TAX BOARD THAT THE DOES APPROPRIATIONS ARE GOING TO TAKE PLACE- IN THE FUTURE. THE OTHER THING THAT IS KIND OF INTERESTING TO ME IS IT IN ALL THE ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL REALLY DO SOUND GOOD AT ALL MEANT THAT- IN THE IN THE THIRD PARTY AGREEMENT AND ALL OF THAT. THIS A PROPOSITION IS ONLY FOR THE LANDLORDS AND TENANTS THAT WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN IT. BUT THE BILL WOULD PROHIBIT EVICTIONS OR REQUEST FOR PAYMENT OF OVERDUE RENT FOR ALL LANDLORDS. WHETHER OR NOT THEY PARTICIPATE IN THE DEFERRED GRANT PROGRAM SO I'LL JUST CONCLUDE WITH THIS MISTER CHAIRMAN I DO APPRECIATE THE CREATIVITY- AND OF COURSE OF THE AUTHOR WANTS TO RESPOND THOSE. YOU KNOW I'M I'M CERTAINLY OPEN TO. RESPONSES TO THOSE CONCERNS- I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S IN THE OKAY IN THE VERNACULAR OF THE LEGISLATURE FULLY COOKED AND I THINK WE NEED TO HOLD IN COMMITTEE AND FILL IN THOSE BLANK LINES AND TRY TO SOLVE THESE OTHER PROBLEMS BEFORE WE MOVE IT TO THE FLOOR AND THEN. AND THEN DELIVER A ANON FINISHED PRODUCTS TO THE ASSEMBLY AND HOPE THAT THEY GET IT RIGHT SO LET'S HOLD IT HERE IN AND FIX IT BEFORE WE SEND IT ON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. WHICH BRADFORD- DO YOU WANT TO ANSWER THAT IN YOUR CLOTHES I HAVE A COUPLE COMIC. SO I MAKE MY COMMENTS AND THEN IF YOU COULD DO YOUR CLOTHES I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER HANDS GO UP- SO I CAN APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES. THE GOAL OF THE WORKING GROUP. THAT'S BEEN WORKING TO HELP WITH ECONOMIC RECOVERY FROM THE COVE IT DEBT CRISIS. IS TO STABILIZE THE RENTAL HOUSING MARKET- AND THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM TO DO THAT- NO ONE IS GOING TO BE FORCED TO OPT IN- BUT WE'VE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR FROM BOTH LANDLORDS AND TENANTS. THAT THERE HAVE TO BE POLICIES THAT ARE FAIR TO BOTH- THERE'S A MIS UNDERSTANDING OF SOME PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA THAT. YOU KNOW EVERY LANDLORD IS PART OF A MAJOR. LANDLORDS THERE'S A LOT OF WORKING PEOPLE WHO WHO BOUGHT A SECOND RENTAL INCOME AS A WAY TO OFFSET THEIR LACK OF A PENSION OR THEIR LACK OF A RETIREMENT. AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF MOM AND POP LANDLORDS OUT THERE. WHO NEED STABILITY AS WELL AS THE TENANTS WHO NEED PROTECTIONS AS WELL AND SO THE IDEA WAS TO COME UP WITH A THREE PARTY AGREEMENT THAT WOULD NOT AFFECT. THE GENERAL FUND OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A CONSTITUTION THE BALANCED BUDGET AND SO THIS WAS THAT PROPOSAL TO SHOULD BRING STABILITY. AND FAIRNESS TO THE RENTAL HOUSING MARKET AND IT'S TOO IMPORTANT OF A TASK. TO NOT HAVE THIS BILL MOVES THROUGH THE PROCESS- OBVIOUSLY GIVEN ARE TRUNCATED SCHEDULE THERE ARE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE WORKED OUT. BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN. JUST TURN OUR BACK TO THAT NEED TO STABILIZE THE RENTAL HOUSING MARKET BECAUSE OF THIS PARTICULAR SNAPSHOT IN TIME. THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE ON THIS PROPOSAL SO. OBVIOUSLY THE CHAIR IS GOING TO BE SUPPORTING MOVING THIS PROPOSAL OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE ON TO THE FLOOR. SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH HASTE. BECAUSE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MARKET PLACE STABILITY IS THAT GREAT SO WITH THAT MISTER MISTER BRADFORD YOU WANNA MAKE A CLOSE. IF I WAS SMART ALLOW YOU TO ME YOUR COMMENTS TO BE MY CLOTHES BUT I WILL. RESPOND TO A FEW THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. YES THERE ARE SOME. GRAY AREAS STEEL BECAUSE WE'RE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO WORK THIS THING OUT AS I STATED IN MY- OPENING COMMENTS PROBABLY. THE MOST DISCUSSED THE ISSUE DURING THIS CALL THE CRISIS IS LANDLORD TENANT RELATIONSHIPS. AND THE FEAR OF EVICTION BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE FEAR OF LANDLORDS NOT BEING TO MAKE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS AND WE TOOK ALL THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AS WE- TRY TO CRAFT A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT LOOKS OUT AFTER BOTH SOME FOLKS. EARLY ON THE DISCUSSION FELT WE WERE TOO HEAVY ON THE TENANT SIDE AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME AS OUR CHAIRMAN STATED. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE LANDLORDS AS BECAUSE THESE ARE NOT ALL MAJOR CORPORATIONS USER MOM AD POP OPERATORS SOME FOLKS RURAL OWNER OCCUPIED HAVE A TRI PLEX THE LIVE IN ONE UNIT IN AB TWO UNITS AVAILABLE. AND THEY'RE RUNNING OUT AND AGAIN AS STATED IT'S THEIR RETIREMENT IT'S YOUR COLLEGE FUND FOR THEIR KIDS OR THEIR GRANDKIDS. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE PROTECTED SO. THIS IS WHAT THIS MEANT A MEASURES TRYING TO DO IS TRYING TO THREAD. THE NEEDLE THE BLANK AREA IS TO LEAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO THE ON GOING. DEVELOPMENT OF THIS CRISIS BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S STILL MOVING JUST WHEN WE THINK IT IS SKYLIGHTS SUCCEEDED WE SEE NOW THERE IS X. INCREASING SPREAD INTO A LOT OTHER STATES SO WE WANT TO BE CAUTIOUS AND NOT JUST PUT. A HARD NUMBER ARE DATE STOP ON THIS MEASURE SO WE WANT TO HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY THAT IF. THIS CRISIS CONTINUES ON WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FLEXIBILITY- I THINK THE COMMITTEE THE STAFF HAS DONE A GREAT JOB TO ESTIMATE YES THIS WILL COST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE NEXT TEN. YEARS POSSIBLY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BUT AT THE SAME TIME. IT'S A LOOSE NUMBER BECAUSE THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM. AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY FOLKS WILL PARTICIPATE I MEAN IN THE BEST. CASE SCENARIO WE WOULD HOLD NO ONE WOULD HAVE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM BUT IF. THOSE INDIVIDUALS CHOOSE TO AGAIN THAT LANDLORD AND TENANT. YOU KNOW CHOOSE THE- DISSIPATED AND WE'VE WE'VE- WE HAVE TO FACTOR THAT IN BUT NOT TO HAVE A PART NUMBER I MEAN. WILL PARTICIPATE IT'SHARD TO GIVE YOU A HARD NUMBER TODAY- IN WHAT IS A FISCAL COMMITTEE SO I UNDERSTAND THOSE CONCERNED BUT AGAIN- THIS IS GOING TO BE REFLECTIVE ON HOW MANY FOLKS PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM. I THINK THE COMMITTEE AGAIN STAFF HAS DONE A GREAT JOB AT THAT ESTIMATION A WHAT THAT COST COULD BE BUT IT COULD BE A WHOLE LOT LAS PHIL- AND- WE'RE AGAIN JUST TRYING TO RESPOND SO YOU. AS I STATED YESTERDAY IN A PERFECT WORLD WE WOULD HOPE WE WOULD HAVE TO USE. THIS MEASURE BUT OUT WE MUST KEEP FOLKS FROM LOSING THEIR HOMES AS WELL AS- INDIVIDUALS GOING INTO FORECLOSURE AND THIS MEASURE RESPONSE TO THAT. CALL OF ACTION WE'RE JUST RYING TO BE RESPONSE. RESPONSIBLE AND RESPONSIVE TO THOSE PEOPLE. PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE SO TODAY- BY LEVERAGING THE POWER OF THE STATE- BALANCE SHEET THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND I CENTER COPIER ON I OUR CONTINUED. WILL COMMITTED TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS BILL AND DISCUSS ANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED TODAY AS IT MOVES TOWARD STARSTRUCK LAST YEAR I VOTE. THANK YOU THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY MISTER WHITE KOWSKI. MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE BECAUSE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SB FOURTEEN TEN THE MOTIONS TO PASS TO THE SENATE FLOOR PORTANTINO.

AND SO THAT'S APPRECIATED AND FOR THE MOST PART EVERYONE WAS VERY CIVIL IN THEIR COMMENTS WHICH IS ALSO APPRECIATED ARE THERE ANY MEMBERS QUESTIONS. OR COMMENTS AT THIS POINT TWO OR DO WE HAVE A MOTION. MISTER BRADFORD YOU WANNA MAKE A COMMONER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'VE WITH FIRST LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THOSE FOLKS WHO CALLED IN AND SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION. BUT I'M- I WAS LEFT WITH SOME CONCERN THAT ANYONE WOULD VIEW THIS. PIECE OF LEGISLATION AS RACES- IF ANYONE KNOWS THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY WE'VE HAD FOUR HUNDRED YEARS. OF DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE BASED ON RACE AND TO. ELIMINATE WHAT PROP. TOOL NINE CREATED IN. A LIMITING OPPORTUNITY FOR WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES OF ANY BY DOESN'T THINK THAT SAID A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA- DO YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HERE LONG STILL- THIS IS LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD. I STRONGLY SUPPORTED BECAUSE EVERY YEARS SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE WE'VE NIBBLED AROUND THE EDGES OF SUPPLIER DIVERSITY HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WOMEN OWNED BUSINESS MINORITY OWNED BUSINESS OR HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE. AT PRIME EXAMPLE IS SB ONE WHEN WE INJECTED LANGUAGE FOR. MINORITY CONTRACTORS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR SO WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO CONTINUE TO DO LEGISLATURE LIKE THAT AN INSERT LANGUAGE LIKE THIS A TOOL NINE WAS REMOVED SO ON THAT NOTE I'D LOOK TOWARDS AND ASK FOR A VOTE ON. AND THAT'S A MOTION. IN A MOTOR FOR SUPPORT EXACTLY AWESOME AND BEFORE WE GO TO A MISTER WHITE CASTLE. MR CHERISHES I NOTE THAT THE STAFF COMMENTS- SAYING FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE THAT THAT THIS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT WILL COST ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PAGE. AND I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THAT THAT'S THE STANDARD FOR ANYTHING THAT APPEARS IN THIS NOVEMBER BALLOT IS EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH IS THE FISCAL EFFECT OF THIS ALTHOUGH THE OPPOSITION RAISE SOME. IN ON SOME COSTS OF DEVALUING EDUCATION AND UNNECESSARY IS THAT THE YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS A THE STANDARD COST PER PAGE FOR ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO BE ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT. YES THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THERE'S NO THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS BALLOT MEASURE THAN ANY OTHER BALLOT MEASURE AND NORMALLY WHAT AS WE SIT HERE IN THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS WERE LIST LOOKING AT THE FISCAL COST TO THE STATE RATHER THAN SOME EXTRAPOLATION OF WHAT WE THINK. GENERATIONS DOWN THE LINE WILL COST ON THE SOCIETY AS A WHOLE CORRECT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE HARD COSTS OF THIS BILL BEING ON THE BALLOT. AND THAT COSTS REFLECTS THAT THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION. I SHOULD ALSO NOTE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DOES NOT HAVE A FILE ON THIS MEASURE NOR DID IT HAVE A FILE ON THE PRIOR MEASURE. ORDERS THAT HAVE A FILE ON THE SUCCEEDING MEASURE SO FOR THE RECORD- WE KNOW THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE DOES NOT HAVE A FILE. I DO WANT TO MAKE ONE COMMENT TO MISTER BRADFORD MISSED BRADFORD UNIT I'VE SERVED FOR A LONG TIME. AND I HAVE TO GIVE YOU SIGNIFICANT PROPS BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE TIME INITIATIVE A PROPOSAL HAS COME UP. FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YOU ABOUT A CONSISTENT MESSAGE AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A- STRONG ADVOCATE OF HOW THAT PARTICULAR. INITIATIVE AFFECTS PEOPLE OF COLOR UNDER REPRESENTED BUSINESSES BOTH AND- BOTH UNDER REPRESENTED PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN AND YOU'VE BEEN ON THAT MESSAGE FOR AS LONG AS I'VE KNOWN YOU. HAVE BEEN A CONSISTENT STRONG VOICE AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THOSE APPROPRIATE COMMENTS TODAY. MS WEBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES FIRST OF ALL WHEN I THINK- OBVIOUSLY THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR PATIENTS DURING THIS OF. HEARING AND APPRECIATE ALL THOSE WHO TOOK THE TIME TO CALL IN BECAUSE- THAT'S WHAT DEMOCRACY IS ALL ABOUT AND WE HOPE WE WILL CONTINUE THAT. BY APPROVING A CA FIVE THAT WILL DIDN'T GIVE THE STATE AND LOCAL LEADERS OPPORTUNITIES TO DESIGN AND REDESIGN PLANS AND PROGRAMS AND POLICIES. THAT CAN BENEFIT CAL CALIFORNIANS GIVING A HELPING US TO OVERCOME THE BIAS THAT WE NORMALLY HAVE IN TERMS OF HISTORY BY SOME EXCLUSION OF INDIVIDUALS. FROM THE OF NOT ONLY THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM BUT ALSO FROM EMPLOYMENT AS WELL AS CONTRACTING THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE SAID MOST OF US. AND IT IS IT IS IT ONLY FITTING THAT WE ALLOW AFTER TWENTY FOUR YEARS OF THE PUBLIC TO MAKE A DECISION BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE. WHAT IS HAPPENING TWENTY FOUR YEARS IN CALIFORNIA AND DO WE WANT TO STAY OUT OF THE OF THE BILL IS OF EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND ACCESS. OR DO YOU WANT TO GET IN LINE WITH THE OTHER. STATES OTHER FORTY TWO STATES IT ACTUALLY A HOPPER FROM BACK. AND AGGRESSIVE% EFFORTS TO TRY TO KEEP. CREATE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IN ACCESS SOMEONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT THIS BILL HAS VERY LITTLE COSTS OTHER THAN. PUTTING IT ON THE BALLOT- BUT I THINK IN THE LONG RUN WE WILL SEE THE BENEFIT OF IT IN TERMS OF WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE ABILITY TO DO. AND ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO PARTICIPATE IN CALIFORNIA ECONOMY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE. THANK YOU MISS WHOEVER FOR BREAKING THIS PHONE THE CHAIRS RECORD. IS A DO. TO THE SENATE FOR.

THIS MEASURE A CA SIX WOULD PUT ON THE BALLOT A PROPOSAL TO LET THE PEOPLE ENGAGE ON WHO SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FIVE YEARS AGO. IS ANOTHER MEASURE. DIRECTED VOTING RIGHTS FOR INDIVIDUALS ON PAROLE. AND THIS WOULD. RIGHT THAT WRONG AND ADDRESS THE CONFUSION ABOUT WHO CAN VOTE. OF COURSE PEOPLE ON PROBATION CAN VOTE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON PAROLE CANNOT VOTE WHEN THEY'RE- ON THEIR PEARL TERM. AND THIS CREATES A LOT OF ISSUES OUT THERE NOT TO MENTION. I DISENFRANCHISES OVER FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN OUR STATE. IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE WE'VE HAD. RED STATES AND BLUE STATES. UP THIS.
