WAS TO INCREASE IT TO FOURTEEN

00:40:27.958 --> 00:40:28.859
IT'S NOW BEEN BACK DOWN TO

00:40:28.926 --> 00:40:31.829
TWELVE. SO WHAT IS THE ACTUAL

00:40:31.896 --> 00:40:35.132
NEED TO INCREASE THE FREE AND-

00:40:35.199 --> 00:40:36.934
IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY.

00:40:37.001 --> 00:40:39.136
UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS IT'S

WITH OPERATING AND MAINTAINING.

00:40:43.407 --> 00:40:45.910
CURES SO IS IT BECAUSE SIX

00:40:45.976 --> 00:40:47.812
DOLLARS WAS JUST NOT ENOUGH. OR

00:40:47.878 --> 00:40:49.580

GARDEN I MEAN HAPPY TO AND

00:50:02.366 --> 00:50:05.302
ADDRESS BUT I THINK- I THINK

00:50:05.369 --> 00:50:06.236
MIGHT BE HELPFUL IS THAT.

00:50:06.303 --> 00:50:07.504
TYPICALLY THAT HAVEN'T GONE

00:50:07.571 --> 00:50:09.072
THROUGH THE FACT THAT THE HUGE

00:50:09.139 --> 00:50:09.940
FEE INCREASE THE PUBLIC ON THE

00:50:10.006 --> 00:50:11.675
BEDROCK BUDGET PROCESS AT LEAST

00:50:11.742 --> 00:50:14.411
IN RECENT REPORT HISTORY- WE

00:50:14.478 --> 00:50:15.545
GET IT OUT IN THE PARTY BECAUSE

00:50:15.612 --> 00:50:18.081
OF ITS HIGH NEED HAVE WHEN. BC

00:50:18.148 --> 00:50:19.049
INCREASE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO

00:50:19.116 --> 00:50:20.183
NEED TO BE A NEED TO BE A

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:24.020
PLACE. TO STAY- RETAIN

00:50:24.087 --> 00:50:24.621
STRUCTURAL BALANCE WITHIN THE

00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:27.324
FUNDS- ARE RECOGNIZING THE KOBE

00:50:27.391 --> 00:50:28.725
CHANGED A LOT OF THINGS AND A

00:50:28.792 --> 00:50:30.427
LOT OF WAYS. ADEQUATELY THE

00:50:30.494 --> 00:50:32.229
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BUT WE

00:50:32.295 --> 00:50:33.397
THOUGHT IT MADE NO SENSE IT

00:50:33.463 --> 00:50:36.233
INCLUDES EVEN THE BUDGET PROFIT

00:50:36.299 --> 00:50:36.733
FIFTY NINE I THINK GOING

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:37.267
FORWARD WILL HAVE TO HAVE

00:50:37.334 --> 00:50:38.335
CONTINUE TO QUESTIONS ABOUT

00:50:38.402 --> 00:50:40.670

WITH A CLAIM WILLING TO AND-

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:48.345
TAKE THIS ONE FOR US BECAUSE WE

00:50:48.412 --> 00:50:49.613
DO THINK THAT THE FEE INCREASES

00:50:49.679 --> 00:50:50.981
ARE NECESSARY FOR STRUCTURAL

00:50:51.047 --> 00:51:02.392
BALANCE IN HERE. IF I COULD

00:51:02.459 --> 00:51:04.361

WAS AND IS BUDGET ADDED TO.

00:51:07.431 --> 00:51:08.665
MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET WHICH IS

ELEVEN AND IS STILL GOING

00:51:16.373 --> 00:51:18.041
WHETHER THOSE COST PRESSURES

00:51:18.108 --> 00:51:20.477
ARE IMPACTING WHY WE HAVE TO

00:51:20.544 --> 00:51:22.078
RAISE HE'S HE'S AT THIS POINT

00:51:22.145 --> 00:51:23.079
AND THESE ARE QUESTIONS WE'VE

00:51:23.146 --> 00:51:24.247
BEEN ASKING. IN OUR BUDGET SUB

RELEVANCE TO THIS IS IN PART

00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:31.788

BEEN REFORMED AND WE'VE BEEN

00:51:38.128 --> 00:51:39.963

HEARD ANY STRESS TODAY ABOUT

00:51:44.668 --> 00:51:46.102
THE LINKS BETWEEN THESE BUT

LESS OF A QUESTION IS MORE OF A

00:52:28.445 --> 00:52:30.981
COMMENT- AND I. ABSOLUTELY

00:52:31.047 --> 00:52:32.482
AGREE WITH THE COMMENT ABOUT

00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:34.351
YOU KNOW IT IS OFTEN NOT SEXY

00:52:34.417 --> 00:52:36.253
TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE

00:52:36.319 --> 00:52:37.921
PARTICULARLY IT INFRASTRUCTURE

00:52:37.988 --> 00:52:39.422
AND OUR UNWILLINGNESS TO DO

00:52:39.489 --> 00:52:41.525
THAT IS ON FULL DISPLAY WITH

00:52:41.591 --> 00:52:42.325
THE DYSFUNCTION IN OUR

00:52:42.392 --> 00:52:43.994
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:46.863
NOW. AND SO THAT- THAT REQUIRES

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:48.498
THIS PARTICULAR ACTION TODAY

00:52:48.565 --> 00:52:49.766
WHAT I WANT TO GET TO IS LESS

00:52:49.833 --> 00:52:51.201
ABOUT THE VENUE ISSUE WHICH WAS

00:52:51.268 --> 00:52:52.536
MENTIONED THE I. T. ISSUE WAS

00:52:52.602 --> 00:52:53.803
MENTIONED WHICH IS JUST TO GET

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:55.539
INTO A GOOD BUDGET PRACTICES

00:52:55.605 --> 00:52:56.840
WHICH WHEN I READ THE STAFF

00:52:56.907 --> 00:52:58.675
REPORT I WAS MORTIFIED. WHEN

00:52:58.742 --> 00:53:00.076
READING THAT THERE ARE FEES

00:53:00.143 --> 00:53:01.678
HAVE NOT BEEN EXAMINED IN OVER

00:53:01.745 --> 00:53:02.946
TWENTY YEARS THAT IS THAT IF

00:53:03.013 --> 00:53:03.880
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN LIKE THAT

00:53:03.947 --> 00:53:05.448
SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND

00:53:05.515 --> 00:53:07.183
I UNDERSTAND WHY THIS MAY HAVE

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:08.852
HAPPENED BUT TO THE QUESTION OF

00:53:08.919 --> 00:53:11.621
TIMING YOU KNOW IT SINCE

00:53:11.688 --> 00:53:12.222
NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE WE'VE GOT

00:53:12.289 --> 00:53:13.757
MANY ECONOMIC EXPANSIONS WITH

00:53:13.823 --> 00:53:14.925
THIS WOULD MARKET IN A MORE.

00:53:14.991 --> 00:53:20.030
APPROPRIATE TIME THIS YEAR WE.

00:53:20.096 --> 00:53:21.865
ARE IN. FIRST TIME HAD IT. FOR

00:53:21.932 --> 00:53:23.099
YEARS AND BASS PEOPLE TO PAY

00:53:23.166 --> 00:53:24.167
MORE. NOW THAT MAYBE NOT. BUT I

00:53:24.234 --> 00:53:26.770
ASKED THE MINISTRY. I THE- WHEN

00:53:26.836 --> 00:53:28.672
WILL YOU ADOPT A FEE OF ALL

00:53:28.738 --> 00:53:30.707
PROCESS. THAT ALLOWS THIS TO

00:53:30.774 --> 00:53:32.409
HAPPEN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO

00:53:32.475 --> 00:53:33.310
MAKE SURE THAT AS POSSIBLE

00:53:33.376 --> 00:53:35.478
WHAT. WE ADJUSTED AND HAVE A

00:53:35.545 --> 00:53:36.813
BIT OF COSCO DOWN MAYBE THEY

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:38.381
CAN GO DOWN AS WELL. THAT IS

00:53:38.448 --> 00:53:39.449
PARTICULAR EFFECT IN THE MIDDLE

00:53:39.516 --> 00:53:41.251
WHICH I APPRECIATE IN IN THE

00:53:41.318 --> 00:53:42.986
AUTHOR TAKING. TO TAKE WHAT WAS

00:53:43.053 --> 00:53:46.189
GOING TO BE A- IN. FEE AND MAKE

00:53:46.256 --> 00:53:48.525
IT TWELVE IN AN- ADVENTUROUS-

00:53:48.592 --> 00:53:49.993
LESS THAN THAT. WHICH SHOWS THE

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:51.895
FLEXIBILITY THAT IS IN HERE

00:53:51.962 --> 00:53:53.096
WHICH IS WHY YOU SHOULD LOOK AT

00:53:53.163 --> 00:53:55.031
THESE THINGS AT LEAST ANNUALLY

00:53:55.098 --> 00:53:56.700
OR AT AT. THAT ANNUALLY IT

00:53:56.766 --> 00:54:00.503
POPPED UP. SO HI I. APOLOGIZE

HERE IN THE COMMITTEE TODAY.

00:54:04.641 --> 00:54:05.508
BUT WHEN LOOKING AT THIS ITEM

00:54:05.575 --> 00:54:06.910
WHICH IS PROBABLY NECESSARY

00:54:06.977 --> 00:54:08.378
GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE

BILL. THERE IS AN EXCELLENT

00:56:29.185 --> 00:56:31.654
REASON WHY- FEE INCREASES ARE

00:56:31.721 --> 00:56:33.823
GENERALLY PROCESS THROUGH THE

ACTIONS OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE

00:56:35.158 --> 00:56:36.960

00:56:37.026 --> 00:56:38.828
DEPARTMENT SAYS WE'RE NOT

00:56:38.895 --> 00:56:40.163
TAKING IN ENOUGH MONEY WE NEED

DOES BUT ALSO TO GO OVER IN

00:56:48.705 --> 00:56:50.273

THEIR MONEY. MAKING SURE THAT

00:56:51.708 --> 00:56:53.243
THE EXPENDITURES ARE REASONABLE

00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:54.878
NECESSARY AND APPROPRIATE. AND

00:56:54.944 --> 00:56:55.945
BALANCING THE NEED THE

00:56:56.012 --> 00:56:57.614
DEPARTMENT AGAINST THE NEEDS OF

00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:58.448
CONSTITUENTS THAT HAVE TO PAY

00:56:58.515 --> 00:57:00.784

00:57:07.657 --> 00:57:09.092
THAT COULD NOT GO THROUGH THE

00:57:09.159 --> 00:57:09.626

WE'RE SAYING IS THAT. THE CARD

01:01:27.583 --> 01:01:28.785

BUT WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS

01:01:58.581 --> 01:01:59.515
SYSTEM IS THAT THERE ARE

SIGNIFICANT HARM. SO THE BILL

03:36:22.936 --> 03:36:24.805
PROCESS DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE

SAME TYPE OF TRAINING PROVIDE

03:36:41.888 --> 03:36:44.825
FIRST AID AND VACCINATIONS IS A

03:36:44.891 --> 03:36:47.394
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE BUT WE

03:36:47.461 --> 03:36:49.396
RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANT INTENT

03:36:49.463 --> 03:36:51.998
TO EXPAND ACCESS TO WHICH WHY

03:36:52.065 --> 03:36:55.535
WE DID NOT SUGGEST IN THE

OVERSIGHT PROTECTIONS IN PLACE

03:37:10.484 --> 03:37:12.352
SO THAT SHOULD THERE BE

03:37:12.419 --> 03:37:13.687
SIGNIFICANT HARM THAT THE STATE

03:37:13.754 --> 03:37:16.857
HAS FRATERNITY TO SUPPORT THOSE

03:37:16.923 --> 03:37:19.192
CONSUMERS SIMILARLY MEMBERS

IN THE I THINK GOING THERE IS

03:37:30.604 --> 03:37:32.105
ARM WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

03:37:32.172 --> 03:37:37.210
LOOK AT THE BASIC. IN PLACE. IF

03:37:37.277 --> 03:37:39.546
THERE'S COMPLAIN. THE BILL

03:37:39.613 --> 03:37:40.747
PRESENTED THERE IS THERE ARE

NONE IN THIS FOR THE SAFEGUARDS

03:37:41.615 --> 03:37:42.883
THE FOR OF BUSINESS AND

03:37:42.949 --> 03:37:45.051
PROFESSIONS. AND AS COMMITTEE

03:37:45.118 --> 03:37:46.586
MEMBERS KNOW WE TAKE A FAIR

03:37:46.653 --> 03:37:48.054
AMOUNT OF TIME WITH COMMITTEE

03:37:48.121 --> 03:37:50.290
STAFF AND WORKING WITH THE

DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS

03:37:50.957 --> 03:37:52.025
AND THE BOARD TO ENSURE THAT

03:37:52.092 --> 03:37:54.428
THERE IS A BALANCE IN ACCESS

03:37:54.494 --> 03:37:56.396
BUT SIMPLY WE WOULD NOT WANT TO

03:37:56.463 --> 03:37:58.932
SEE. THOSE THAT ARE NOT LIFE

OR OTHER. RELATED ITEMS SO

03:38:04.738 --> 03:38:05.705
AGAIN WE BELIEVE THAT THE

03:38:05.772 --> 03:38:07.307
REGISTRATION TO HELP SUPPORT

03:38:07.374 --> 03:38:09.443

NOT. A CENSURE BUT REGISTRATION

03:38:15.182 --> 03:38:16.216
AND THE REGISTRATION AGAIN

03:38:16.283 --> 03:38:17.684
PROVIDES THAT FROM OR TO ALLOW

03:38:17.751 --> 03:38:18.351
FOR WHAT WE THINK WE

03:38:18.418 --> 03:38:21.421
COLLECTIVELY WANT TO SEE WHICH

03:38:21.488 --> 03:38:30.397
INCREASED TAX. AND THAT'S WHAT.

03:38:30.464 --> 03:38:34.768
THE REGISTRATION. TO STILL

03:38:34.835 --> 03:38:35.535
RESERVE THAT PROTECTION AND

03:38:35.602 --> 03:38:36.937
UNFORTUNATELY WITHOUT THE

03:38:37.003 --> 03:38:39.139
PROTECTIONS WE HAVE HEARD

03:38:39.206 --> 03:38:39.906
SPECIFICALLY FROM THE

03:38:39.973 --> 03:38:41.775
VETERINARIAN BORE. THAT THEY DO

03:38:41.842 --> 03:38:43.944
NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

03:38:44.010 --> 03:38:44.911
LOOK AT. THE POTENTIAL CRIMINAL

03:38:44.978 --> 03:38:47.347
INTENT. OR PERHAPS. DRUG

03:38:47.414 --> 03:38:49.216
OFFENSES THAT MIGHT BE.

03:38:49.282 --> 03:38:50.517
SUBJECTED TO IT WITHIN THE

03:38:50.584 --> 03:38:53.019
SHELTERS GET SOME BASIC

03:38:53.086 --> 03:38:53.920
PROTECTIONS IN PLACE TO

SOMETHING THAT WE TRY TO LOOK

03:38:55.856 --> 03:38:57.858
AT. AS WELL. FOR THE SENATE AND

03:38:57.924 --> 03:38:59.860
THAT'S WHY. WITH THE

03:38:59.926 --> 03:39:00.927
FUNDAMENTAL AGAIN WE COULD'VE

03:39:00.994 --> 03:39:02.262
GONE STRONGER ON STRICT

03:39:02.329 --> 03:39:03.563
