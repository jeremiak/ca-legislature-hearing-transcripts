AS BACKGROUND ON TODAY'S JOINT RULES COMMITTEE MEETING TODAY IS THE SEVENTH JOINT RULES COMMITTEE MEETING CONVENED AROUND THE TOP OF THE CAPITALIZE PROJECT. IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS. THE INAUGURAL MEETING WAS HELD ON JULY SIXTH TWENTY SEVENTEEN. INFORMATION ON THIS PROJECT BEEN READ UP. AND CONTINUOUS AVAILABLE ON THE LEGISLATURE'S ANNEX PROJECT WEBSITE. WHICH IS W. W. W. DOT ATTICS DOT ASSEMBLY DOT CA DOT GOV IN HIS BILL ON THAT WEBSITE SINCE APRIL OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN FOUR YEARS AGO. THE ANNEX PROJECT WELL IT HAS ITS ROOTS IN A SESSION SO THE BUILDING CONDUCTED DURING THE SCHWARZENEGGER ADMINISTRATION. WAS REALLY PUT IN MOTION IN JANUARY TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN'S BUDGET MESSAGE ANNOUNCED HIS PLAN TO FUND THE COST OF REBUILDING THE CAPITOL ANNEX. THAT'S YEAR GOVERNOR FOR THAT PLEDGE SO INTO LAW CHAPTER THIRTY ONE OF THE STATUTES OF TWENTY SIXTEEN. THAT LAWN ISSUE THE FUNDING AND ASSIGNED TO THIS COMMITTEE THEN LED BY CHAIR RICH GORDON. RESPONSIBLE PURSUE THE REPLACEMENT OR RECONSTRUCTION OF THE KAPLAN OF BUILDING. TO ADDRESS ITS MANY AGE RELATED DEFICIENCIES. TOP PRIORITIES INCLUDE DOING A BETTER JOB VIRGIN PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENTS IN THE BUILDING'S DESIGN AND LAYOUT. AND MATURELY UPGRADING ADA ACCESS CAPITALIZE. IN JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN THIS COMMITTEE INITIATED PLAN STUDY COMPLETED IN DECEMBER OF THAT YEAR WHICH DOCUMENTED THE KNOWN LIFE SAFETY HAZARDS OF THE CURRENT ANNEX. THAT STUDY NOTED THAT THE RISK FOR BUILDING OCCUPANTS AND VISITORS IN A FIRE OR AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE. OR INCREASED BY OVERCROWDING AND CONFUSED A DIFFICULT EXITING FROM THE PARMELEE CONGESTION UPPER FLOORS WHICH LACKS SPRINKLERS. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP THE CAP LAST PROJECT TO SUMMARIZE. FULL CAPITAL FORCE ALMOST TWO MILLION YEARLY VISITORS. CONCERT IN NYC RESPONSIBLY ASSIGNED BY LAW THE JOINT RULES COMMITTEE.

SO THAT THEY ADVANCE THE INTERESTS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN EXACTLY BRANCH IN SERVING CALIFORNIA FOR DECADES TO COME- THIS PREEMINENT JOINT RULES COMMITTEE AUTHORITY ALIGNS WITH THE STATE CAPITOL'S HISTORY SINCE THE END OF WORLD WAR TWO. IN CALIFORNIA A COUPLE BILL IS UNIQUE IN THE STATE'S BUILDING OF A TORY BECAUSE BY LAW. FOR THE LAST SEVENTY YEARS PROJECT TO UPDATE OR REBUILD THE CAPITAL. LIKE THE HISTORIC WEST WING RESTORATION IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE EIGHTY TWO. INDIVIDUAL CAPITALIZE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IN THE EARLY NINETEEN FIFTIES HAVE BEEN DIRECTED BY THE LEGISLATURE. SO WITH THAT I WANT TO INVITE MY COLLEAGUE- CENTER HERTZBERG IF HE HAS AN INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS BEFORE WE- TURN IT OVER TO MR HART AND MOCHA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN I JUST WOULD LIKE TO. ADOPT YOUR COMMENTS AND JOIN WITH YOU I WANT TO TAKE THE TIME. SINCE WE'RE LIMITED ON OUR SCHEDULE HERE TO ALLOW FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND TO. REFER TO MISTER HART THANK YOU SO MUCH. VERY GOOD OF. SO I TURN NOW TO. THE HEART. GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING- WE- ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH TODAY AND TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ATTRIBUTES TO THE- NEW ANNEX BUILDING WE PLAN ON COVERING A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TOPICS AND AS WE GET STARTED. I THINK IT'S- LET ME. SAY THIS THE- CALIFORNIA'S NEW CAPITAL AND IT SHOULD CONVEY TO VISITORS CALIFORNIA'S POSITIVE HOPEFUL OUTLOOK. FOUNDED UPON THE DELIVERY OF DEMOCRATS- DEMOCRACY WHICH UNFOLDS THERE BY WELCOMING ALL CALIFORNIANS. ENGAGING ALL CALIFORNIANS AND SAFEGUARDING THE FUTURE OF ALL CALIFORNIANS AND- DEMONSTRATING HELPFUL HELPFUL ACCESSIBLE AND SUSTAINABLE DESIGNS. WHILE PRESERVING THE BEAUTY INVESTORS OF CALIFORNIA'S LEGACY CAPITAL PARK. AND INVITING IT ALL ITS GUESTS TO EXPLORE AND TAKE PRIDE IN ONE OF THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT. CAPITOL BUILDINGS IN THE NATION. I THINK THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT QUOTE THAT OUTLINES AND- KIND OF SUMMARIZES THE WORK THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING. OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS SINCE WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S WELCOMING AND ENGAGING AND THAT IT'S OPEN AND AVAILABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE RESPECTFUL OF THIS LAND AND THE HERITAGE OF THIS LAND. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IS SUSTAINABLE THAT IS BEAUTIFUL AND THAT WE PRESERVE THE TREES IN THE VISTAS AND THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS CAN TAKE PRIDE IN THIS BUILDING. AS WE MOVE. FORWARD WE ARE GOING TO TALK TODAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SITE DESIGN PRINCIPLES. WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THE TREES AND THE PARK AND HOW WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE DESIGN OF THIS BUILDING TO TRY TO PRESERVE. ALL OF THE TREES AND TO. ADDRESS THE- OF THE ASPECTS OF THE PARK. WE WILL ALSO GO THROUGH AND LOOK AT THE CAPITOL IN TOTAL WE WILL LOOK AT THE PLANS IN THE STACKING DIAGRAMS. WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE PUBLIC SPACE IN THE LIGHT COURT. AND FINALLY WE WILL CONCLUDE WITH THE FACADE DESIGN. SO IS AN OVERVIEW- THE CAPITOL ANNEX. IS BEING DESIGNED TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT- THE CURRENT ANNEXES STRUGGLING WITH ADA ACCESS AND COMPLIANCE IN CIRCULATION IN THE CURRENT ANNEXES- BOTH INADEQUATE AND DEFICIENT. HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ABOUND THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING AND WE HAVE JUST COMPLETED AN ANALYSIS AND SURVEY AND WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THOSE MATERIALS AND WILL BE REMOVING THEM- INADEQUATE BUILDING SYSTEMS ARE CURRENTLY WITHIN THE- CURRENT BUILDING AND AN OUTDATED SEISMIC DESIGN. THE NEW BUILDING WILL HAVE AN UPDATED DESIGN THAT WILL ALLOW FOR THE- TYPE OF SEISMICITY THAT ARE IS NECESSARY. IN ADEQUATE OFFICE SPACE WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE OFFICE SPACE IN THE DESIGN OF THAT SPACE IS BOTH EFFICIENT. AND SAFE. CURRENTLY THE FLOORS ARE NOT ALIGNED WITH THE WEST WING AND THAT CREATES A NUMBER OF ISSUES- BOTH EIGHTY A. AS WELL THE CIRCULATION AS WELL AS COMMUNICATION AND BEING ABLE TO DIRECT PEOPLE. AND HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHERE TO GO AND HOW TO MOVE THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING SO WAY FINDING HIS DIFFICULT CURRENTLY. FIRE AND LIFE SAFETY CONCERNS ARE PROBABLY AMONGST THE GREATEST THERE ARE INADEQUATE EXITS THAT CURRENTLY FILLED THE HALLS OF THE ANNEX. AS WELL AS THE STAIRWAYS. AND THEN SECURITY AND THE BUILDING HAS OUT LIVE THE- BUILDING CODES WAS BUILT TO. SO YOU THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS IN DESPERATE NEED OF A NEW ANNEX BUILDING. THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN DESIGNING AN ANNEX BUILDING BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF BALANCE THAT HAS TO BE ACHIEVED BOTH WITH REGARDS TO HOW YOU TREAT THE LAND. HOW YOU TREAT THE SURROUNDING TREES HOW YOU TREAT THE BUILDING. AND HOW YOU DESIGNED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S SAFE AND SECURE. WE DEVELOPED THREE DIFFERENT DESIGNS THERE WAS A DOUBLE T. DESIGN A CIRCLE DESIGN IN THE SQUARE DESIGN. WE STUDY THE ATTRIBUTES AND THE BENEFITS IN THE DETRIMENTS OF EACH AND THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. MET SINCE SEPTEMBER AND IDENTIFIED THE DOUBLE T. AS THE SCHEME THAT WE WERE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH. IT IS A FUNCTIONAL DESIGN. IT IS ALSO A DESIGN THAT CAN BE BUILT FOR THE BUDGET. AND IT IS APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED AND SIX THOUSAND SQUARE FEET- YOU CAN SEE HERE THE HOW IT NESTLES IN IT IS DESIGNED SO THAT IT WORKS WITH BOTH THE TREES IN THE PARK. IT ALSO REFLECTS AND DESIRE AT THE DESIGN OF THE BUILDINGS DOWNTOWN IT IS NOT I'M OVERLY MASSIVE BUILDING. IT IS DESIGNED TO REDUCE ITSELF IN THE SITE SO THAT IT. IT SETS SUBTLY BEHIND THE WEST WING OR THE HISTORIC CAPITAL AND DOES NOT OVER POWER THE BUILDING AND WE THINK THESE ARE VERY STRONG ATTRIBUTES OF THIS DESIGN. WE WILL NOW TURN THE TIME OVER TO JOSE PALACIOS WHO IS THE- DESIGN- PRINCIPAL AND PARTNER FOR SO M. WHO IS DESIGNING THE BUILDING. THANK. THANK YOU DAVID BLOOM- ALL BEGIN SINCE WE'RE RUNNING A LITTLE LATE. WITH THE ALL IMPORTANT DESIGN PRINCIPLES AND THOSE- DAVID MENTIONED WE ARE INSPIRED BY THE STATEMENT THAT HE HAD A RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS PRESENTATION. OUR FIRST OUR FIRST PRINCIPLE IS TO PER SE- PRESERVE THE BEAUTY OF THE PARK. AS YOU KNOW THE FOOTPRINT OF THIS BUILDING IS SURROUNDED. BY A MANY IMPORTANT TREES- THAT ARE EITHER VERY LARGE HISTORIC OR DEDICATED. OUR TEAM HAS BEEN COMMITTED. TO PRESERVE THE PARK AS WELL AS PRESERVE A GREAT NUMBER OF THESE TREES WITH THE EMPLOYMENT BUT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW PART AT NEW BUILDINGS ARE. AND THAT- MY COLLEAGUE- DAVID WALKER FROM P. W. P. R. LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT WILL ADDRESS THE DESIGN OF THE PARK AND- THE SECTION FOLLOWING THE SECTION IN THE PRESENTATION. ANOTHER PRINCIPLE IS TO RECOGNIZE THE PARK IN THE STYLISH OTHER CONNECTIONS AS WELL. WITH THIS PROJECT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RELOCATE THE VEHICULAR PART OF PART RAMPS THAT- THAT BIFURCATED THE PARK. N. HAVE THE ABILITY TO GENERATE CONNECT THE EAST SIDE WITH THE WEST SIDE OF THE PARK. WE THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BENEFIT OF THIS PROJECT. HERE YOU SEE THE FOOTPRINT OF THE BELOW GRADE PARKING EXPANDING FROM AN L. L. ST TWO AND ST AND WE HAVE SHAPED. THIS PARKING TO MISS SOME OF THOSE IMPORTANT TREES. ON TOP OF THAT PARKING THE DESIGN PROPOSES THAT A PEDESTRIAN PROMENADE THAT ALSO CONNECTS. THE NEW NEED EASTERN TREE OF THE OF THE CAPITOLINA X. PROJECT WITH L. N. N. STREET AND BEYOND WITH THE CITY GRID. IT ALSO PRESERVES. THE VIEWS TO THE CAPITOL DOME AS WELL AS BUSINESS WITHIN THE CAPITOL PARK. ONE OF THE ONES OF USE THAT HAS BEEN MOSTLY ENHANCED ARE THOSE VIEWS FROM THE- NORTHEAST AND THE SOUTHEAST I WAS THE PEAK OF THE BUILDING PULLS AWAY A LITTLE BIT TO REVEAL MORE OF THE HISTORIC BUILDING. AND THE DON'T. WITH THAT I'M GONNA THAT- DAVID WALKER CONTINUE WITH THAT PART PERCENT TAKE. HELLO MY NAME'S DAVID WALKER AND I'M WITH- PETER WALKER AND PARTNERS- WHERE THE LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS WORKING ON THE CAPITAL PROJECT. AND- C. OKAY- THE HERITAGE AND MEMORIAL TREES IN THE CAPITOL PARK ARNIE ARE A VALUABLE- CULTURAL COLLECTION THAT PROVIDES A UNIQUELY CALIFORNIAN CHARACTER OF OUR CAPITOL GROUNDS THIS COLLECTION OF TREES AND HISTORIC ARTIFACTS. HAVE A GREAT SIGNIFICANCE TO OUR COLLECTIVE CALIFORNIA HISTORY AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE ADDED TO. WE'VE BEEN STUDYING THE EXISTING TREES WITH OUR ARBORIST FOR MORE THAN A YEAR NOW AND I AM HAPPY TO REPORT. THAT THE ENTIRE DESIGN DESIGN TEAM IS COMMITTED TO THE PRIMARY MANDATE TO DISTURB IS FEW. OF THE EXISTING TREES AS POSSIBLE. THE COUPLE PARK IS A COLLECTION OF TREES THAT REFLECTS MANY DIFFERENT PERIODS OF HISTORY. AS THE CAPITAL FACILITIES HAVE EXPANDED TO ACCOMMODATE GOVERNMENT NEEDS. HOWEVER THE CAPITOL PARK TREES ARE NOT ALL CREATED EQUAL. IN THIS SLIDE- OF THE EXISTING SITE YOU CAN SEE THE RELATIVE SIZE OF THE TREES SURROUNDING THE HISTORIC WEST WING TO THE WEST NORTH AND THE SOUTH THERE THERE THE LARGE. REALLY LARGE- TREES THAT- CAME ALONG WHEN THE WEST WING WAS BUILT. BUT YOU CAN ALSO SEE IN THE PLAN THAT THE TREES PLANTED DIRECTLY EAST OF THE EXISTING ANNEX. BETWEEN THE ANNEX AND TWELFTH STREET. THEY'RE SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER IN SIZE- THESE ARE THE LARGEST TREES IN CAPITOL PARK AND THEIR PLANET AND- WHEN THE WEST WING WAS BUILT- AT THE TIME OF THE NINETEEN FIFTY ANNEX CONSTRUCTION THE AUTOMOBILE RAMPS CREATED A VERY DESTRUCTIVE BEAR IN THE CAPITOL PARK ESSENTIALLY SEPARATING THE WEST FROM THE EAST. THE ELIMINATION OF THESE RAMPS WILL ALLOW THE PARK TO BE CONNECTED RECONNECTED. TO BE ONE PARK AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY CONCEIVED. THIS PLAN SHOWS HOW WE'VE WORKED CAREFULLY TO INSERT THE NEW BUILDING PROGRAM EFFICIENTLY. WITH ONLY WITHIN THE AREAS THAT INCLUDE THE REMOVAL OF THE EXISTING RAMP. AND THE INSERTION OF THE UNDERGROUND GARAGE ON TWELFTH STREET. AND ALL WITHIN THE AREA THAT HAS THE LEAST HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE. WE'RE CURRENTLY CONSIDERING. AROUND SIXTY TO SIXTY FIVE CAPITOL PARK TREES FOR TRANSPLANTING REPLACEMENT AND PROTECTION IN PLACE WITHIN THAT AREA THAT SHOWN IN RED. THIS PLAN SHOWS THE CURRENT SCHEMATICS SITE DESIGN- THE LIGHT OLIVE COLORED TREES ARE ALL THE EXISTING CAPITAL TREES THAT WILL NOT BE TOUCHED. THE BRIGHTER GREEN TREE SHOWN ARE APPROXIMATELY THIRTY TO FORTY TREES EXISTING TREES THAT HAVE BEEN DISPLACED BY THE BUILDING PROGRAM. AND WILL BE A TRANSPLANTED TO NEW LOCATIONS. THE DARK OLIVE COLOR TREES ARE APPROXIMATELY FIFTY PROPOSED TREES- REPLACEMENT TREES GROVES WHICH WILL FLANK THE PROPOSED ANNEX AT THIS NORTH AND THE SOUTH AND LINE THE TWELFTH ST PROMINENT. AND THEN THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY FORTY FIVE PALM TREES AFFECTED BY THE PROPOSED GARAGE RAMPS ALONG L. AND N. STREET. WHICH WILL BE MOVED DIRECTLY IN BOARD ALONG THE PARK PRINTER WHICH YOU CAN SEE IN THE PLAN. HIGHLIGHTED IN IN THE BRIGHTER COLORED TREES GREEN TREES PALM TREES. THE MINIMAL INTERVENTION SHOWN IN THE PLAN WILL CREATE A SEAMLESS CAPITOL PARK THAT PRESERVES NEARLY ALL OF THE LARGE EXISTING TREES. AND ALLOWS VISITORS TO MOVE MOVE FREELY EAST AND WEST. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT TO THE CAPITOL PARK. THAN WHAT EXISTS TODAY. THANK YOU DAVID AND NOW WILL MOVE TO PERCENT- THE BUILDINGS STARTING WITH THE BUILDING ENTRIES AND PUBLIC SPACE AGAIN INSPIRED. BY THE SAME- QUOTATION THAT WE FIND AND- WEB PORTAL. OR THE CAPITOLINA X. BUILDING. AT THIS. THE PROJECT WILL BE WELCOMING ENGAGING SAFEGUARDING IN THAT IT STARTS WITH THE ENTRY THERE ARE THREE NEW ENTRIES ON THE IONIC SIDE. IN ADDITION TO THE ENTRY. THE SYMBOLIC ENTRY ON THE WEST SIDE- OF THE OF THE HISTORIC BUILDING. THE TWO ENTRIES NORTH AND SOUTH ARE ALMOST IN THE EXACT SAME LOCATION AS YOU FIND THE CURRENT BILLIONS. AND THERE WILL BE ALSO AN ENHANCED ENTRY ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE BUILDING. THIS IS A VIEW OF THAT ENTRY. THE IDEA IS THAT THIS WILL BE A- TRANSPARENT. INVITING WELCOMING AND ALSO SAVE IN FREE LEAD O- FREE TO MOVE IN INTO THE BUILDING AS YOU PROCEED THROUGH THE- INTERESTED REAL IN THE SCREENING DEVICES. YOU WILL WALK INTO A LARGE PUBLIC SPACE A PUBLIC ROOM OF SORTS. A SKYLIT OVER OUT ON THE SECOND FLOOR THAT WILL PERMEATE THE VIEWS TO THE CAPITAL DAHLE- VERY STRONG. SYMBOL OF GOVERNMENT THIS SPACE WILL BE AMPLE ENOUGH TO MOVE FREELY CONGREGATE AND PROCEEDING TO- PARTICIPATING IN TO THE- THE- HEARING ROOMS. THIS IS THE MOST PUBLIC FLOOR OF THE BUILDING. AB ALTHOUGH THIS GUY LIED ON THE SECOND FLOOR THERE IS A THERE IS A LIGHT WELL THAT ALSO WILL PROVIDE DAYLIGHT TO ALL THE WORK SPACE ABOVE THE SECOND FLOOR. IN THIS HEALTH FOOD LIGHT AT DAYLIGHT WILL ALSO PENETRATE ALL THE WAY TO THE WHAT WE CALL THE PLAZA LEVEL. WHERE WE ENTER THE BUILDING FROM THE EAST SIDE. MOVING ON TO THE FUNCTIONAL ASPECTS OF THE BUILDING LIKE DAVIS SAID THIS BUILDING NEEDS TO BE FUNCTIONAL EFFICIENT IT NEEDS TO FACILITATE THE WORK OF GOVERNMENT. BUT HE ASKED TO DO SO IN A HELPFUL ACCESSIBLE IS SUSTAINABLE WAY. HERE'S A VIEW OF HOW THE PROGRAM STACKS OF THE BILL. THE PURPLE COLOR THAT YOU SEE THERE IS LEVEL ONE WHERE THE EXECUTIVE FLOOR. IS LOCATED VERY MUCH THE WAY IT IS TODAY. ALL OF THE FLOORS OF THE WESTWAY BUT HIS TO BUILDING BY BE A LOT IN MY LIFE AND INTEGRATED INTO THE NEW BUILDING. OF ALL OF THIS A LEVEL ONE FLOOR THE EXECUTIVE FLOOR. MOST OF THE LEGISLATIVE. WORK SPACE BE ACCOMMODATED FROM LEVELS TWO TO FOUR. BELOW THE LEVEL ONE THERE'S A PLAZA LEVEL AND A LOWER LEVEL THE PLASMA LEVEL IS THE ENTRY LEVEL ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE BUILDING WHERE MOST OF THE HEARING ROOMS WILL BE LOCATED IN THE LOWER LEVEL IS MOSTLY SUPPORT SPACE AN ENTRANCE FROM THE PARKING. HERE'S A VIEW OF THAT EXECUTIVE LEVEL THAT IS ORGANIZED AROUND A VERY GENEROUS- CIRCULATION IS SPACE PUBLIC SPACE IN A U. SHAPE AND THIS IS WHERE THE GOVERNOR AND LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR SUITES WILL BE. LOCATED THE ENTRY TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR'S SUITE IS UP ON THE SITE. OPPOSITE OF THE ROTUNDA OF THE WEST WING. AT A BIT SYMBOLIC OF THE BONDS THE GOVERNMENT. MOVING ON TO THE SECOND FLOOR THE ALL IMPORTANT CONNECTION OF THESE CHAMBERS IN THE SENATE CHAMBERS. TO THE NEW BUILDING HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF IN ALL OF THE SUPPORT SPACES OF THE FACILITATE THE FUNCTIONING OF THIS CHAMBERS WILL BE PROVIDED IN THIS NEW BUILDING. THE REST OF THE FLOOR IS OCCUPIED BY OFFICE SPACE FOR MEMBERS AND COMMITTEES. AS WE MOVE U THERE'S A FLOOR THAT WE CALL THE LEVEL TWO AND WHICH IS SANDWICHED BETWEEN LEVEL TWO AND LEVEL THREE. AS WE HAVE A- LARGE VOLUME OF THE SPACE- THAT WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IN THIS CASE THE MOST OF THE FLOOR WILL BE OCCUPIED BY THE ASSEMBLY. THIS IS LEVEL THREE AND AS YOU CAN SEE THE FLOORS ARE VERY TYPICAL- WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO ACHIEVE EFFICIENCY. AND FLEXIBILITY FOR THE FUTURE. THE CIRCULATION IS A CONTINUOUS CIRCULATION THERE ARE NO DEAD ENDS BUT WE CALL THE FIGURE EIGHT CIRCULATION. THAT WILL ALSO. PROMOTE CHANCE ENCOUNTERS AND FOR THAT REASON WE'VE ACCOMMODATED THE SPACES OFF THE CORE THERE. THAT PEOPLE CAN MEET FOR IMPROMPTU MEETINGS AND CONVERSATIONS. MOVING ON TO THE FOURTH LEVEL ONE OF THE IMPORTANT FEATURES OF THE FOURTH LEVEL IS THAT WE PLACE THE CAFE IN THAT LEVEL VERY MUCH THE WAY THAT IT IS TODAY ON THE TOP FLOOR. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN SEE THIS FLOOR. IS THE ABILITY. FOR THE CONFIGURATION OF THE PLAN. TO BRING DAYLIGHT TO ALMOST EVERY SPACE AND EVERYONE WORKING IN THE BUILDING WHETHER THAT IS FROM THE PARK. OR THE LIGHT WELL IN THE CENTER OF THE BUILDING. MOVING DOWN TO THE PLAZA LEVEL THIS IS WHERE THE HEARING ROOM CITED ARE ACCOMMODATED IN THE ORGANIZED AROUND A VERY LARGE CENTRAL SPACE THAT ALLOWS THE PUBLIC TO EASILY COME IN AND COME IN AND GO OUT AS WELL AS A GOOD- LIFE SAFETY- BENEFIT THAT WE HAVE IN THIS VERY LARGE ROOMS. WITH A LOT OF PUBLIC. LASTLY THE FLOOR BELOW THAT THE LOWER LEVEL IS MOSTLY USED FOR. SUPPORT SPACES MAINLY A LOT OF MECHANICAL. AND I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT THIS BILL NEW BUILDING WILL BE A CLEAN ENERGY WE WILL BE ON ALL ELECTRIC BUILD. SO ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT WOULD BE ELECTRIC. AND THEN THERE'S ALSO- A SECURE ENTRANCE INTO THE BUILDING FROM THE PARKING. ANOTHER GOOD SUSTAINABLE POINT TO MAKE IS THAT WE NEED TO BUILD LESS AND THE PARKING IS. EQUIPPED WITH A STACKER PARKING WHICH- REQUIRES LITTLE OVER HALF THE AMOUNT OF A STANDARD PARKING SO WE MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF AREA THE WEEK. KIND OF BUILT ON THE GROUND. WHAT. THE CEILING HEIGHT IS UP ABOUT MAYBE FOURTEEN FEET. SOMEWHERE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD. SO ARE MOVING ON TO THE MY THAT MESSING IN THE FACADE OF THE BUILDING AGAIN INSPIRED LIKE THE SAME- THE STATEMENT THAT YOU FIND IN THE BOOK- WEB PORTAL. THE NEW DESIGN. IS RELATE AND RESPECTS THE WEST WING. THE MASSING OF THE BUILDING AT IN THE HEIGHT OF THE MASSING RESPECT THE HEIGHT OF THE EXISTING BALUSTRADE OF THE WEST WING. IT ALSO IS ORGANIZING A THREE BY THREE PARTITE MANNER WITH THE BASE MIDDLE AND TOP JUST LIKE THE WEST WIND IS IN THE ARTICULATION OF THE FACADE. IS A VERTICAL AND IN A RHYTHM THAT IS SIMILAR TO THE COLUMNS IN THE BY LAST YEAR'S OF THE WEST WING. WE ARE ALSO EXTENDING THE EXISTING PLAN. WHERE THE WEST WING SITS ON TO FURTHER INTEGRATE. THE NEW BUILDING INTO THE WEST WING. THIS IS A TYPICAL VIEW THAT YOU WILL HALF OF THE BUILDING AT. FROM THE PART. WHERE THE TREES ARE IN THE FOREGROUND. WHICH ARE VERY MUCH PART OF THE OVERALL COMPOSITION. OF THE DESIGN. HERE'S A VIEW. OF THE NORTH COUNTRY WHERE THE BUILDING RECEIPTS BACK TO CREATE MORE ROOM FOR THE MOON TREE. AND FOR THE GROVE OF THE SISTERS OF MERCY. AND LASTLY HERE'S A VIEW. FROM THE SOUTHWEST LOOKING AT THE HISTORIC BUILDING IS STILL RETAINING HIS PROMINENCE AND IMPORTANCE AND WITH THE NEW BUILDING RECEDING IN THE BACK. WITH THAT THANK YOU AND NOW WILL- THIS CONCLUDES OUR PRESENTATION AND HOW WILL RUSSIA DIRECT FLOOR TO MISTER GRIFFITH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JOSE FOR THAT PRESENTATION AND- W. P. AND MISTER HART. SO I TURNED OUT TO. HOW MY COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROMMEL'S. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION- AND MONITORING IT AND BEING INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT- SINCE WE GOT TO THE LEGISLATURE- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ADDRESSING- SOME OF THE CONCERNS ON THE TREES AND THAT TYPE OF A AREA THERE BUT- I KNOW THERE STILL IS A WORK TO BE DONE. HOWEVER ONE OF THE THINGS AND I'VE BEEN CONSISTENT ON ON ASKING FOR- FOR TRIBAL- CONSULTATION AND THE INPUT IN THE PROCESS THAT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN THERE. IS THE QUESTION- MISTER CHAIRS IS THAT WHAT PROCESS ARE WE FOLLOWING- WORKING WITH THE TRIBAL- GOVERNMENTS HERE IN OUR LOCAL AREA IS IT SB EIGHTEEN OR AB FIFTY TWO OR IS OUR DIFFERENT PROCESSES BEING- ADHERE TO DURING THIS CONSTRUCTION PHASE. AT THIS JUNCTURE. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING. PERKASA A TRIBAL GROUPS FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS BY LAW DGS IS HANDLING THE SEQUOIA PROCESS WHICH IS ONGOING. AND- I ANTICIPATE THAT THEY ARE. APPLYING. GENERALLY THE PROCESS OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER CATTO'S AB FIFTY TWO- I AM NOT PERSONALLY. I'M A NUMBERS GUY IS A LAWYER BUT EIGHTEEN DOESN'T STAND OUT TO ME BUT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING SYSTEMATICALLY WITH. AT THE REQUEST EARLY ALL WE DID- BUT CADAVER DOGS TO THE ENTIRE PARK TO CHECK FOR ANY BURIED HUMAN REMAINS. WE'VE ALSO DONE OUR OWN DUE DILIGENCE WITH GROUND PENETRATING RADAR OF THE SITE ITSELF. WE HAVE REACHED AGREEMENT TO USE- SUPPORT TRIBAL MONITORS WHENEVER ANY DIGGING IS TAKING PLACE. WITH PROTOCOL FOR HOW ANY ANYTHING WHICH IS ENCOUNTERED WILL BE HANDLED. SO. I SORT OF YOU THIS IS A TWO PART QUESTION I THINK BY LAW THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONDUCT OF THE SEQUEL PROCESS FALLS TO DGS THE FAR GENERAL SERVICES AND THEY OF COURSE OUR SERVER TO THE LAW GOVERNING SYKORA. AND WE DIDN'T MAKE IT A SPECIAL DISPENSATION FOR THEIR JOBS ALL THAT THEN WITH RESPECT TO THE ACTUAL SITE AND CONDITIONS ON THE SITE. AND WHAT MIGHT BE FOUND WE HAVE ACTUAL AS I SAY WE'VE INITIATED STUDIES. AND REQUEST FOR THOSE STUDIES CAME OUT A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE TRIBES. AND OUR PROTOCOLS IN PLACE FOR HOW WE WILL- HANDLE ANYTHING THAT IS FOUND. AND THERE IS ACTUALLY A BROAD OF. MANY MANY ITEMS OF DISCUSSION AGREEMENT THAT HAVE A RESERVE OF THE TRIBES ALL FORMS GUIDE THE PROJECT GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST TO REITERATE YOU BELIEVE THAT- THE PROCESS OF AB FIFTY TWO IS WHAT'S BEING ADHERED TO DURING THIS WHOLE CONSTRUCTION PHASE OF THE ANNEX WORKING WITH LOCAL TRIBES. I BELIEVE IT. I GENERALLY BELIEVE THAT IS THE CASE BUT AS I SAY IT IS BY LAW IT IS TGS HAS RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THE SEQUEL PORTION THANK YOU IN AND WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW WITH THE G. S. AND PROBABLY GET A BRIEFING- TO FIND OUT IF THAT IS THE PROCESS THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY FOLLOWING. ON WHICH LEADS TO MY NEXT- QUESTION IS AS FAR AS BEING ABLE TO HAVE A POTENTIAL MITIGATION PLAN IN THE EVENT OF UNCOVERING- INDIAN ARTIFACTS. AND ALSO A PLAN. TO IN CASE THERE IS INADVERTENT DISCOVERY OF NATIVE AMERICAN RANGE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT MITIGATION AND THAT CONSULTATION. IS ON GOING PRIOR TO ANY- AREAS THAT MIGHT ON COVER THOSE TWO- AREAS OF CULTURAL RESOURCES. CULTURAL ARTIFACTS OR INVERT DISCOVERY IN AN AMERICAN REMAINS YEAH. AS I SAID THAT ACTUALLY THE ISSUE OF. IT REMAINS WAS ADDRESSED RAISED AS A VITAL ISSUE THIS PROJECT IN THE DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN STUDY. WE HAVE BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE TO. ENGAGE THE TRIBE'S EARLIER YOU ASSISTED IN THAT- I WOULD SAY. THERE IS ALREADY A PLAN IN PLACE OF COLLABORATION FOUR WE WE'VE GOT OUR OWN DUE DILIGENCE STUDIES THE- CADAVER DOGS THE GROUND PENETRATING RADAR THESE WERE THINGS UNDERTAKEN IN CONSULTATION WITH THE TRIBES. OF THOSE HAVEALREADY BEEN COMPLETED AND THERE IS THE PROTOCOL ALREADY IN PLACE FOR WHEN THERE'S GROUND DISTURBANCE TO HAVE TRIBAL MONITORS THAT WE WILL PAY FOR- SO THAT'S THAT IS A PRIORITY IT HAS BEEN A PRIORITY DURING MY TENURE. STARTED WITH THE DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN PLANNING STUDY WHICH AT MY INSISTENCE NOTED THAT THAT WASN'T AND ELEMENT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARITY AND IF AT A FUTURE MEETING- IF WE HAVE ANOTHER MEETING JOINT RULES IF WE COULD AGENDAS THAT COMPONENT OF IT SO WE COULD ALL BE CLEAR ON ON WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON IT AND HOW THE DISCUSSIONS ARE. MOVING FORWARD- IN DEALING WITH THE TRIBAL CONSULTATION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR EARNERS. YEAH ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND IT IS VERY EXCITING WITH THANK YOU FOR LEADERSHIP ON THIS PROJECT I REMEMBER WHEN I CAME IN AS A STAFFER TO THIS BUILDING THIS IS STILL THE INKLING PHASE OF JUST AN IDEA AND TO SEE THAT NOW VISUALIZE IN FRONT O US IS QUITE EXCITING TO BE ABLE DO THIS AND I DO THINK IT'S A MONUMENT FOR THE FUTURE GENERATIONS TO BE TAKE PRIDE IN CALIFORNIA STATE CAPITOL SO I DO THANK YOU FOR LEADERSHIP AND BEING. ASSERTIVE ABOUT LEGISLATIVE LEGISLATORS ROLE IN THIS PROCESS I JUST CURIOUS I MADE A MISTAKE IN THE OPPOSITION EARLY BUT IS THERE AN ANTICIPATED OR GOLD DATE OF WHEN THIS WILL BE FINISHED. HE THE GOAL IS TO HAVE IT CONCLUDED BY THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND THAT IS KIND OF A PRACTICAL RULE THAT'S HOW THE WEST WING WAS DONE YOU YOU HAVE THIS ISSUE THOSE LAWMAKERS WE ARE VERY BUSY IN THE CONDUCT OF OUR WORK THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF EVERY YEAR. AND IN THE- FOURTH QUARTER OF AN EVEN NUMBER HERE WE TYPICALLY HAVE ELECTIONS. SO REALLY FOR THE WHOLE PROJECT THE ONE TIME THAT IS OPPORTUNE TO MOVE LAWMAKERS IN MASS IS THE FOURTH QUARTER OF AN ODD EVERY YEAR SO THAT'S- BEEN THE TARGET- WE EXPECT THAT STARTING NEXT YEAR WE WOULD HAVE CONCLUDED FOR A GRAND OPENING ON. CALIFORNIA'S ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIFTH. BIRTHDAY ADMISSIONS DAY SEPTEMBER NINTH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND WE HAD TO HIT THAT MARK. OR WE SUFFER A LOT OF TURMOIL MOVING PEOPLE MIDSTREAM OR WAITED UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN AND THAT JUST ADDS DELAY AND EXPENSE. SO THE GOAL IS. FOURTH QUARTER TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND I WILL SAY THAT A MAJOR PART OF THE PROJECT HAS BEEN TO AGGRESSIVELY SUPPORT STUDIES. AND PREPARATION SO-THAT WHEN WE ARE READY TO MOVE IT AN MOVE SPEEDILY THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS WE PLAYED ALL ALL OF OUR PARTNERS IN THIS PROCESS. WHEN THINGS TRIMMING YES PLEASE BEFORE E GO TO BUY EXTRA. GOOD GOING TO THE POINT OF PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE. IN A HUNDRED YEARS YOU MAY NOT HAVE CARS RIGHT. WE DON'T HAVE CARS SO BUILDING A GARAGE FOURTEEN FEET HIGH THAT'S WHY I ASKED THE QUESTION. YOU COULD ULTIMATELY TURNED OTHER SPACE. WE'VE DONE A LOT OF THAT KIND OF THINKING ABOUT WHAT. FLEXIBILITY WE MIGHT NEED. BECAUSE WHO KNOWS WHAT THE FUTURE IS GOING TO BRING BUT I SUSPECT IT WON'T INVOLVE CARCASS. SURE THAT OBSERVATION WITH MR- OUR SERVER BROUGHT SO. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CALLING- OBVIOUSLY THIS IS VERY BEAUTIFUL ALL THE THOUGHT THAT WENT INTO IT BY YARD SIX- BASED ON THE PRESENTATION AND MY QUESTION IS. IT AT THE SAME TIME THAT IS VERY BEAUTIFUL AND ALSO LOOKS A LITTLE BIT STERILE. AS FAR AS. YOU KNOW POSSIBILITIES THERE AND SO I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW WHERE THE THOUGHT OR WHERE. AND HOW WILL WE INCORPORATE SOME ASPECTS OF THE CULTURE OF THE STATE RIGHT- THE BEAUTIFUL DIVERSITY OF THE STATE AND THE PROGRESSIVE VALUES OF THE STATE SO I'M CURIOUS HOW OR WHEN. THAT CONVERSATION HAPPENS- SO THAT IT'S MORE THAN BEAUTIFUL GLASS AND THE AND THE AND THE BUILDING THAT WERE RESTORING WHICH IS OR OR WE'RE WE'RE KEEPING AN- AND INCORPORATING HERE BUT- HOW ELSE DO WE GO BEYOND. THAT INTO SOMETHING THAT MORE ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA HER GOOD. I THINK ON THAT ISSUE THERE'S A COUPLE OF RESPONSE I WOULD SAY ARE WE FULLY EXPECTED FOR EXAMPLE THESE KINDS OF INTERIORS. WOULD BE A PALETTE FOR THAT SORT OF. ALL ARTWORK WHAT WHATEVER WE CHOOSE TO BRING FORWARD. SO YOU ARE CORRECT YOU ARE SEE MORE THE STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS WITH YOU GET ALL THESE AREAS WHERE PEOPLE TRAVEL WE WOULD SEE THE OPTION FOR EMBELLISHMENT. AND SHARING THE NARRATIVE OF CALIFORNIA. THE OTHER PIECE I DESCRIBED. WE DO HAVE CONTEMPLATION. YOU KNOW THE CAPITAL WAS ALWAYS ENVISIONED PEOPLE TO ENTER FROM THE WEST THAT'S WHEN IT WAS BUILT. AND THERE IS A PLAN FOR A VISITOR CENTER. WHICH WILL ALLOW ALL THE GAS ALL THE TOUR GROUPS TRAFFIC IN THE CAPITAL OF FROM BELOW THE ENTRY PLAZA. INTO THE BASEMENT AD HAVE THE RUN OF THE WEST WING AND THE WHOLE BUILDING. AND OF COURSE THE VISITOR CENTER IS ACTUALLY SET UP TO BE THE PLACE WHERE YOU WOULD ESTABLISH. AND IT'S NOT ME TO BE APPROVED FOR DRUG RULES COMMITTEE OR MAYBE A SUB COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP WORK OR THE GOVERNOR- CHARACTERIZED IN THE NATURE OF THE STATE THE RICHNESS OF THE STATE THE ABUNDANCE OF THE STATE THE DIVERSITY OF THE STATE. AND MAKE THAT A VERY CALIFORNIA CENTRIC AND DEMOCRACY CENTRIC. PLACE TO COME TO THE CAPITOL AND DISCOVER WHAT ABOUT OUR GREAT STATE. IT COULD BE CULTURAL THINGS IT COULD BE IMAGES ABOUT SHASTA OR LASSEN OR WHITNEY HIS EXCEPTIONAL THINGS WITHIN OUR STATE I SORT OF THINK. I FEEL LIKE. IT'S SORT OF LIKE ANY CHILD WHO COMES THE STATE CAPITOL. TO SEE SOMETHING IN THE BILL IN THEIR MINDS OVER THERE WHERE THEY ARE FROM. WHICH IS VERY EASY A STATE LIKE OURS. ARM SEOUL I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT THE INTERIORS OF THESE BILLS BECOME A PALETTE TO DO A LOT OF NARRATIVE ABOUT THE STATE AND A MARKER C. ERA AND I REALLY SEE A VISITOR CENTER IS PREEMINENTLY THAT. ARM AND- BUT I DO RECOGNIZE THAT I AM CERTAINLY TURNED OUT BY THE FALL OF TWENTY FOUR SO OTHERS WILL PICK UP THAT BATON IT IS ALSO EXPECTED. WELL I WILL SAY HERE ARE. A VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION OF I'D LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN IS. IT IS SO THE GOVERNOR HAS AN INTEREST IN AND I ACTUALLY SUPPORTERS STRONGLY I KIND OF FEEL WE WOULD BE WELL SERVED TO DEDICATE THE TWO ROOMS ON THE FIRST FOUR OTHER RESTORED CAPITAL. OF IN THE NORTH WEST CORNER. TWO ROOMS DEDICATED TO OUR NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE SAID THEIR HISTORY. AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP. AND WHILE I FEEL IT IS. SINCE I WAS THE TOP STAFFER TO THE MEMBER WHO DID THE WEST WING PROJECT. I FEEL WHAT I CAN DO IS I'M A STRONG PLACE TO SAY THIS WOULD BE A GREAT. WAY TO DEDICATE TO FOUR FOUR ROOMS TO THIS BUT ACTUALLY THE CONTENT I FEEL THAT SOMEONE ELSE'S CONVERSATION IS SORTED OUT MY CONVERSATION TO LEAD. OUR SO THAT'S A MORE VERY SPECIALIZED PURPOSE I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I WOULD ENVISION THAT IN THE- IN A VISITOR CENTER. WE WOULD PROBABLY APPROACH IT ON THE BASIS THAT THERE ARE. AREAS THAT ARE DEDICATED SORT OF A YEAR AROUND THE MESSAGE. AND IT WOULD ALSO BE A SPACE THAT WULD BE SORT OF A CHANGEABLE MESSAGE. AND THAT WOULD ALLOW DIFFERENT GROUPS DIFFERENT OUTLOOKS TO KIND OF WORK WITH LEADERSHIP ON DEVELOPING A SOME SORT OF SPECIALIZED THING. AND SO ALL OF THOSE IDEAS ARE ARE SORT OF PART OF THE VISITOR CENTER CONVERSATION. BUT YEAH I STRONGLY BELIEVE WITH YOU CENTER THAT THE IT. THIS PEOPLE THOU SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT. WHEN I CALIFORNIA COMES THERE THEY SEE THEMSELVES. IN THIS IN SOME WAY. CENTER THEY RELATE TO AS PRESIDENT AND A PART OF THE BUILDING. THANK YOU BILL YES. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHEN I REALLY APPRECIATED THE CONVERSATION THAT YOU AND SENATOR ALSO JUST HAD- AS FAR AS YOU KNOW HOW EVERYONE VIEWS THIS BUILDING THE NEW BUILDING. AT ITS OBJECTIVE I THINK ONE THING THAT GIVES US A SENSE OF PLACE IS THE VIEW OF THE CAPITOL DOME FROM THE ATRIUM AND I'M I'M GRATEFUL THAT THEY HAVE. TAKEN THAT SO EVERYONE WHO'S IN THAT BUILDING REMEMBERS WHERE THEY ARE AND THAT IS A VERY SPECIAL PLACE I DO WANT TO TAKE NOTE OF THE SECURITY CONCERNS ARE RAISED IN IN CLOSED SESSION- THE ISSUE THAT I WANT TO RAISE IS ONE THAT I THINK- CENTER HERTZBERG. USED A VERY IMPORTANT ORD JUST RECENTLY HE TALKED ABOUT FLEXIBILITY ABOUT THE BUILDING PARTICULARLY ABOUT THE FUTURE. AND IF YOU LOOK AT- THE WAY THAT WE LEGISLATE THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY LAWMAKERS FOR STATE OF FORTY MILLION- UPON ENTRY- THE STATE HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND AT THE TURN OF THE LAST CENTURY. ABOUT A MILLION AND WE MAY HAVE SIXTY EIGHTY MILLION PEOPLE REPRESENTIN THE FUTURE. THE HUNDRED TWENTY LAWMAKERS IS BAKED INTO OUR OUR CONSTITUTION BUT THERE COULD BE A TIME. WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF LAWMAKERS AND OF COURSE FLEXIBILITY IN TECHNOLOGY WHICH WE HAVE NOT EMBRACED DURING THE PANDEMIC- CERTAINLY IN THE FUTURE WOULD WOULD BE HARD TO IMAGINE THAT WE DON'T. ENGAGE IN NOT FLEXIBILITY A LITTLE BIT MORE. BUT THAT. HOW DO WE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHAT THAT ANNEX WILL BE LIKE FOR A POTENTIAL- YOU KNOW THE- LEGISLATURE THAT MIGHT BE MORE THAN A HUNDRED TWENTY LAWMAKERS. I THINK THAT'S A VERY. FORWARD LOOKING WHO CANNOT DISMISS IT OUR- AGAIN THIS I'M ONLY THE DRIVER DURING THIS TIME IT ACTUALLY STARTED- MY PREDECESSOR AND FIRST OF ALL IT'LL PICK MCCONNELL PASSED TO SOMEONE ELSE I THINK ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATURE ARE. I SORT OF ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL MOVE FORWARD THE TIME IN THE SWING SPACE WHILE THIS BUILDING GETS ADDRESSED WE WILL MOVE BACK I WOULD ANTICIPATE THE FOLKS IN L. O. V. WILL THEN MOVE INTO THE- SWING SPACE. AND THEN L. BE WILL GET ADDRESS BECAUSE IT ALSO HAS ISSUES. THE STATUTE BY WHICH WE AUTHORIZED TGS TO PURSUE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SWING SPACE. INCLUDED LANGUAGE THAT REFERRED TO THE FACT THAT IT WAS ANTICIPATED THERE WOULD BE A LONG TERM NOT DEFINE JOINT OCCUPANCY OF THAT BUILDING BY THE LEGISLATURE AND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE ALL THE POTENTIAL THAT THAT MINE WAS ACTUALLY TO SUPPORT THE L. B. PROJECT TO BE HONEST BUT IT IS SOMEWHAT OPEN ENDED SO THERE'S THERE IS SOME FLEXIBILITY WE ARE NOW IN THE PROCESS OF- AS A CAPITAL CAMPUS PARTY TO HAVE. WELL DESIGNED BUILDINGS THAT ARE CLOSER AT HAND I. SO I THINK THERE IS BASED UPON THE WORK OF FLORIDA THERE THERE IS POTENTIAL- FOR DEALING WITH THOSE SORTS OF THINGS. I IN MY EXPERIENCE. THE ONCE IT BECOMES EVIDENT THAT THERE IS A D. THE LEGISLATURE TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR WILL FIND A SOLUTION- YOU KNOW ALL THAT WOULD REQUIRE AT A MINIMUM ALTHOUGH WOULD REQUIRE. IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONCLUDED THAT. WE'RE GOING TO SEND THE BILL THE GOVERNOR THE GOVERNOR DOESN'T SIGN IT WILL DO AN OVERRIDE. AND THAT IS THE ONE ON CHECK BOX IN THE NEW GENERATION OF LAWMAKERS AS A YOUNG MAN I WORK WITH. A MEMBER OF THE DIDN'T OVERRIDE AB FIVE MEETING I REMEMBER VERY CLEARLY. A POLICY BACK RIGHT SO WE DO HAVE A TOOL IN OUR TOOL KIT IS AN INSTITUTION. TO REALLY FORCE AN ISSUE IF WE FELT WE HAD IN THE- THAT'S WHAT I THINK THAT THAT'S NOT REALLY THE POINT I SUPPOSE A POTENTIAL WAY TO THE BRAINS FROM IT THIS IS THAT EXTRA SPACE WOULD EITHER BE. WHAT WE CALL THE SWING SPACE NOW BUT COULD BE THE L. O. B. AS AN EXTRA BUILDING FOR MORE MEMBERS IF THAT. IS THE NEED OF THE LEGISLATURE OR ADDITIONAL. OFFICE SPACE HOWEVER YOU WANT TO DESCRIBE THAT. PETER THAT'S RIGHT LOOK. TWENTY YEARS AGO THERE WERE THIRTY TWO UNITED STATES SENATORS AND A HUNDRED EIGHT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. THOSE THINGS CHANGE I COMPLETELY AGREE I THINK THAT. ON THE ONE HAND WE WORK HARD TO CREATE AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY- LIKE THAT WORD THANK YOU. IN THIS PROCESS BY. DEALING WITH THE NEAR TERM THING OF CARS AND THE LIKE AND- WHAT WE THINK COULD BE THE CASE BUT THERE'S A PROPOSALS PROPOSAL RECENTLY INCREASE THE LEGISLATURE TEN THOUSAND MEMBERS RECENTLY ON THE BALLOT. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN WORK OUTSIDE THE PARAMETERS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND MAKE THOSE KINDS OF DETERMINATIONS WILL WORKING REMOTELY TODAY WHO KNOWS WHAT THAT WORKS CAN LOOK LIKE. I THINK WE CAN ONLY GO KIND OF AS FAR AS WE CAN. LOOKING AROUND THOSE CORNERS AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE TECHNOLOGY AND EVERY LEVEL GET AS MUCH DIMENSION THERE'S POSSIBLE GET AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY AS POSSIBLE. AND IF IN THE FUTURE. WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE A YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW I MEAN I WOULD LOVE TO BE IN A SITUATION WE CREATE THAT LEVEL OF FLEXIBILITY- SHOVING BUT- I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH FOR THAT WOULD GO WITH THAN THAT. IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THE HYPOTHETICALS BUT I'LL SAY THIS MUCH. IT IS CERTAINLY- BEEN IN MY MIND AND EXPLORE THOSE THOUGHTS BUT IT'S KIND OF THIS LIMITED BY SOME PRACTICAL REALITIES. AND I THINK WE CAN GO AS FAR AS WE CAN. IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES TODAY. ADA ACCESS EARTHQUAKE ACCESS- AND WHAT'S COLDER. DISPATCH THIS IN ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT CHALLENGES OUR STAFFING HEALTH OF OUR STAFF. CHALLENGES MEMBERS. AND I THINK GETTING PAST THOSE THINGS. ARE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT IN THE NEAR TERM SO I HOPE THAT HELPS A LITTLE BIT. THANK YOU. NO ONE OF THE COME SYSTEM IT IT'S LIKE. THIS IS ACTUALLY A VERY FITTING THING FOR THE MEMBERS OF DRUG RULES COMMITTEE BECAUSE WE ARE. CUSTODIANS OF THE INSTITUTION. BECAUSE ACTUAL WHAT THE BUILDING WHAT WHAT A LEGISLATIVE BUILDING NEEDS. IT IS TO BE A FACILITY SITES IN SUCH A WAY THAT. YOU CAN HAVE MEMBERS. AND OF A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE CHAIR HAVE THE CAN HAVE THEIR COMMITTEE STAFF NEAR AT HAND. BECAUSE ACTUALLY CHAIRMAN CHAIRWOMAN WHO HAVE THEIR STAFF BECOME MORE EFFECTIVE IS CHEERS WE ARE UNDER TERM LIMITS WE ARE SUBJECT TO TWELVE YEARS MAXIMUM WE APPOINT SOMEONE A CHAIR TO SUPPORT A MEMBER BY LETTING THEM HAVE READ READY ACCESS TO THEIR STAFF NOT ACROSS THE STREET BUT RIGHT IN THE BUILDING ACTUALLY SUPPORTS THE QUALITY OF LAWMAKERS SUPPORTS THE FITNESS THE STRENGTH OF THAT CHAIR OVERTIME. SO REALLY A MAJOR PART OF THIS PROJECT IS TO MOVE THE INSTITUTION BACK IN A DIRECTION WHERE. CHAIRS AND STAFF CAN BE COLOCATED AS A WAY TO KIND OF STRENGTHENED THE LEGISLATIVE WORK AND YOU SORT OF PLAY THAT OUT OF YOUR SAID OURS IS LIKE IT'S MORE THAN JUST HOUSING OF MEMBERS IT'S LIKE A SOCIAL FACILITIES AND TO BE HONEST I THINK PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT A PART OF A LECTURE DON'T ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND. THE WAY SOME OF THESE THINGS WORK TOGETHER TO STRENGTHEN LAWMAKER. SIDE LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE WOULD HATE TO THINK THAT- ANY MEMBERS THAT ARE PUT INTO THE SWING SPACE FOR THE ELEVATOR IN THE DOG HOUSE. YEAH THAT- THERE JUST MIGHT BE A SPACE AND FLEXIBILITY ISSUE AND THAT THAT'S- THAT'S SOMETHING TO CONTEMPLATE FOR THE FUTURE YEAH NO IT'S GOOD I WANT TO QUOTE MARK TWAIN WHO SAID THE MAN WITH A NEW IDEA IS A CRANK. UNTIL IT SUCCEEDS AND I WANT TO TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN GETTING THE L. O. B. OUT OF GOVERNOR WILSON WAY BACK WHEN- WHEN THAT WAS FOR LIKE A NEW IDEA. AND NOW IT'S BECOME INTEGRATED OUR BRACES SO NO LONGER CRANK A CENTERS FOR YEAH FELT LIKE ONE OF THE TIME. BUT YOU KNOW JUST JUST YOU KNOW GO AGAIN IN HAVING THIS KIND OF MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THERE WAS AS WE AS AN INSTITUTION CARE DEEPLY ABOUT PEOPLE AND SET STANDARDS IN THE LIKE WE MOVED OUT OF THIS HOUSE SIXTEEN COMMITTEES ACROSS FLORIDA. BECAUSE PEOPLE'S WORKING CONDITIONS ARE SO DIFFICULT AND CREATED NEW AND BETTER OFFICES FOR MEMBERS- THAT WEREN'T SO CRAMPED AND GAVE IT A CAN YOU GIVE CONFERENCE ROOMS HAVE A PLACE TO EAT- AND THE LIKE AND IN A CHILD CARE CENTER. TO DO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS DEALING WITH THE THOSE ISSUES SO YOU'RE RIGHT WE BOTTOM FROM PUBLIC GOVERNOR WILSON WHATEVER YEAR THAT WAS I CAN'T REMEMBER TOWARD ON THE ONE IN THE BACK WHICH IS NOW. THE SPACE FOR THE SWING SPACE. AND WE HAVE ALL. EXCEPT TO YOU'VE GOT THE SET HERE REPRESENTS A DISTRICT YEAH. CENTER THANK YOU AND THANK YOU WHILE CERTAINLY ENOUGH LONG ENOUGH TO ENJOY THE NEW BUILDING IT WILL BE IT IS IN MY DISTRICT AND I'LL BE LOOKING AT IT AS THE RESIDENTS SACRAMENTO FOR A VERY LONG TIME I'M SURE- SO THANK YOU SO MUCH I APOLOGIZE I WASN'T ABLE TO BE THERE FOR. ANOTHER HEARING GOING ON- POLICY HEARING BUT I DID HAVE A- SO FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU- ONE OF THINGS THAT'S GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT I KNOW THAT YOU'VE PAID ATTENTION TO IS SERVE BOTH PUT THE FLOW THE PUBLIC BUT ALSO SAFETY. AS WELL- KNOWING THAT- BUT I GUESS MIKE WHAT THE QUESTIONS I HAVE AND AGAIN I'M JUST LOOKING AT PICTURES OF RENDERINGS AND SO FORTH YOU KNOW IT IS IN SACRAMENTO AND- SACRAMENTO GETS VERY HOT IN THE SUMMER. AS WELL INCLUDING IN AUGUST WE DO END OF SESSION I SEE A LOT OF GLASS THERE- SO YOU MAY HAVE RATED DRESS THIS BUT PERHAPS YOU CAN TOUCH ON A YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO GO FOR A BETTER CLIMATE FUTURE AND SO FORTH AND SO- IN TERMS OF ITS- ENERGY OF BALANCE AND DID I WAS WONDERING LIKE DO WE HAVE AND AGAIN I'M NOT ARCHITECT SO IT WE- HAD. TO HAVE MORE- LIKE HEAT HEAT SINKS AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS THAT HELP US REDUCE OUR ENERGY USE WHILE ALSO KEEPING THE BUILDING COOL EFFICIENTLY ESPECIALLY DURING THE PARTICULARLY HOT DRY SUMMERS WE HAVE HERE HOOKED RIGHT WHETHER WE HAVE HERE IN SACRAMENTO SO IT'S MORE EFFECTIVE. SACRAMENTO'S AT KLEINER. AND MAKE IT HARDER. GOING TO THE TO VERY GOOD CENTER WILL ONE OF THE- OF THE VERY. GOES WE WILL HAVE AMONG MOST ENTERED EFFICIENT CAPITALS. IN THE NATION. AND RATED HIGH FROM LEAD STANDPOINT BUT LET ME TURN TO. MR PLUS HILLS. WOULD MAKE. THEY'RE VERY OFTEN. MHM THANK OF THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION THEN- THERE ARE MANY ASPECTS TO THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE BUILDING ONE OF WHICH IS THE PERFORMANCEOF THE EXTERIOR WALL AS YOU MENTIONED THE GLASS COULD BE AN ISSUE- THE WAY THE BUILDING IS A SIGN IS ABOUT. THEY SAVE YOU VERY CLOSE TO A WHAT WE CALL THE SPEND OF LESS OPAQUE BLACK. SO THAT- OBVIOUSLY REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF- SOLAR HEAT RADIATION THAT COMES IN ANOTHER ASPECT OF- OF THE TECHNOLOGY THAT EXISTS TODAY IS AT THE HIGH PRICE PERFORMANCE OF THE GLASS. THAT IS THAT IS. EXISTING TODAY IS A- VERY VERY- HIGH PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF MITIGATING SOLAR HEAT GAIN. AND AT THE SAME TIME ALLOWING DAYLIGHT TO COME IN. AS YOU KNOW ANOTHER- CONDITION OF ENERGY OPERATIONAL EXPENSES ARE THE LIGHTS RIGHT WHEN WE BRING THEY LIGHT IDEALLY. YOU CAN TURN THE LIGHTS OFF AND NOT EXPEND THAT ENERGY SO WE WANNA HARVEST THAT THEY LIKE AND WE WANT TO MITIGATE THAT GLARE AT WHICH WE DO WHAT WE CALL A FRIEND TO PATTERN THAT IS APPLIED TO THE- INSIDE SURFACE OF THE GLASS. THAT ALSO REFLECTS THAT HEAT OUT SO IT IS A VERY HIGH PERFORMANCE EXTERIOR WALL. IN GENERAL ON. ALL ASPECTS OF THE PROJECT. WE HAVE FOR RAISE THE CHALLENGE FOR THE OUR PARTNERS WE DO ONE ENERGY EFFICIENT BUILDING FOR EXAMPLE. BUT WE FOR A SAID WELL WE'RE CERTAINLY HAS IT IN CUTTING EDGE CALIFORNIA STATE CALIPHATE EXHIBIT. WELL UNDERSTOOD OUTSTANDING DESIGN BUT NOT BLEEDING EDGE NOT SOUL SO FAR OUT THERE THAT YOU YOU HAVE A TECHNOLOGICAL FAIL. SO IT'S SORT OF A FORWARD LOOKING BUT WITH THE CONSERVATIVE BENT- BUT ON THE ISSUE OF GLASSES VERY. I WOULD SAY WE'RE SEEING A LOT MORE USE OF HIGH PERFORMANCE CLASSES IN CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE- THE FACT IS PEOPLE LIKE WORK AND WHERE THEY SEE SUNLIGHT SO THERE'S SORT OF A WORK FORCE CONSIDERATION. PROVIDE MORE NATURAL LIGHTING THAT CAN ACCESS THE SWEETS CERVANTES COULDN'T CERTAINLY CERTAINLY DIED DON'T OBJECT TO A CLASS IN ITSELF- THE MATERIAL HI IT'S ALSO THINKING ABOUT THE NO THE MASS OF THE BUILDING AND HOW CAN REPRESENTS THE HEAT SAYING. OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW LIGHTS THE PRESENCE OF PEOPLE GENERATES HEAT AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS I APPRECIATE THAT AND EVEN I UNDERSTAND YOU CAN HAVE NOW PUT GLASS PANES AND AGAIN I DON'T KNOW HOW HORRIBLE IT IS. THAT ACTUALLY A SOLAR PANELS THAT ALSO ACT AS WINDOW PANES AS WELL SO THE DEGREE WE CAN EVEN GENERATE ENERGY- WITH THE APPROPRIATE TYPE OF. PANELS AGAIN WHETHER IT'S A COST EFFICIENT OR NOT I DON'T KNOW BUT- I THINK IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY AS WELL- BUT THOSE ARE GOING TO. SEND RAZA IS COMMON ALSO WAS WE WANT THIS GOING TO BE WARM AND INVITING WHY IS IT WARM NOT JUST KEEP HIGHS BUT YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF PEOPLE WALKING N. THIS NOT SO TECHNOLOGY IS GREAT ON THE BIG PHONE IT DOES PROPONENT OF- HIGH TECHNOLOGY- BUT ALSO WE WANT PEOPLE TO FEEL WELCOME WHEN THEY WALK IN AND SO AN OPPOSING GLASS STRUCTURE AGAIN I'M NOT A PHYSICAL LAST. NOTE EXACTLY WHAT THE TONES AND SO FORTH NAY MAY CREATE THAT SENSE OF IS IT JUST A BIG INSTITUTION THAT HOW MOST PEOPLE VIEW THE STATE OR IS IT SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE TO FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE OWNERSHIP OVER SO AGAIN APPRECIATE THE WORK ON THIS THANK YOU. I DO WANT TO SAY I THINK THAT IS WE DEFINITELY ALL WANT A WELCOMING BUILDING. AND ONE IS I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT LIKE. THE TALK ABOUT THAT EAST ENTRY. AT THE- IT JUSTIFIES. IF YOU'RE ON THE OUTSIDE. YOU DO SEE THE GLASS. BUT THEN YOU SEE. THAT LARGE ASSEMBLY AREA UNDER A SKYLIGHT. AND I ACTUALLY THINK IF YOU EVER BEEN IN A PLACE WHERE YOU'RE ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN AND YOU SEE LIKE FALLING. AHEAD OF YOU THAT ITSELF TO SORT OF DRAW YOU IN. IT LOOKS LIKE OKAY I CAN GO IN THERE. SO I DO THINK THAT. YOU KNOW IT SEEMS SORT OF HOKEY. BUT THE STAIRCASES IN THE WEST WING ON THE NEW WILL POST HAVE THOSE PINEAPPLES THAT ARE CARVED IN THE WOOD. AND THAT'S BECAUSE IF YOU WERE TRAVELING MISTER CASES YOU'D WALK PAST SO SUSPENDED PINEAPPLES. AND THAT WAS A SYMBOL OF WELCOME. THAT'S HOW YOU MOVE AROUND THE BILL IN EVERY TURNER'S A PINEAPPLE THERE'S SORT OF A WELCOMING REMINDER. THAT'S VERY MUCH ONE OF THE GOALS. THAT THE L. AND THE CITY FOR THE VISITOR CENTER. YOU KNOW YOU THINK FOR ALL THE KIDS WHO COME HERE. WHAT ASIDE FOR OUR OUR MOST AUGUST SELVES THAT'S A JOKE OUR IS THE EXPERTS REALLY EDUCATIONAL ABOUT OUR DEMOCRACY OR CELEBRATORY ABOUT THE STATE AND ITS RICHES- THE MANY MANY QUALITIES THAT OUR STATE HAS THAT'S ALL SOMETHING THAT WE HOPE THE INTEGRATED BUILDING BAD FIGHT FRANKLY I FEEL THAT'S A WORK OF MY COLLEAGUES. WILL HELP WITH. THANK YOU- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY ARM. WELL THANK YOU ALL THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE- THANK YOU MEMBERS WILL NOW MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT. AND I WANT TO SAY WE HAVE A TWO MINUTE LIMIT ON ALL PUBLIC COMMENTS AS WE NEED TO WRAP UP SOARING CLEAN CLEAN THE CHAMBERS ADVANCE OF SESSION AT ONE PM TODAY. ARM SOUL WE HAVE MEMBERS. OF THE PUBLIC WHO WISH TO SPEAK. JUST PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS DRUMMING SALINAS HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED AUBURN INDIAN COMMUNITY- TODAY I AM HERE TO EXPRESS OUR CONCERNS ON AND OPPOSITION TO THE PROJECT- EVERYTHING THAT WAS SAID TODAY AS FAR AS TRIBAL CONCERNS- WORDS I WANT TO FOCUS ON THIS WERE POTENTIAL THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL POTENTIAL. OF WHAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE FOUND ON THE CAPITOL GROUNDS VERY SAD TO NOTE THAT THE WORDS OF OUR TRIBAL ELDERS THE WORDS OF THE TRIBAL COUNCIL. THE WORDS OF THE TRIBAL HISTORIC PRESERVATION OFFICER FROM UNITED AUBURN ARE DISCOUNTED. AND LOOKED AWAY. THE TRIBE WAS HERE. THE PEOPLE LIVE HERE THEY INHABITED THIS AREA SOUGHT POTENTIAL. IT IS WHAT IT IS THEY HAVE THE HISTORY HERE. YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE POINT OF TIME CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT- THEY WORK TO ERADICATE THE TRIBES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW IT'S SAD TO SEE THAT ONCE AGAIN THE GOVERNMENT IS AGAIN COMING TO. DISCOUNT THE HISTORY AND CULTURE OF THE TRIBE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR. WE ARE PAUSING AS ANOTHER WITNESS. PROCEDURE MICROPHONE. GOOD AFTERNOON- I'M RICHARD CAL ONE FORMER CHAIR OF THE STORK STATE CAPITAL COMMISSION I'M HERE TODAY IS A VOLUNTEER WITH PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY FOR OUR CAPITAL WE TOO ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE PROJECT AS YOU'VE CURRENTLY CREATED IT- I NOTICED SIGNIFICANT NEW INFORMATION RECEIVED TODAY. IT'LL TAKE US A LITTLE TIME TO DIGEST THAT- MEMBERS THE PUBLIC IS VERY HUNGRY. TO HEAR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROJECT IS THE VISITOR CENTER COMPLETELY OFF THE TABLE IS IT NOW PART OF THE ANNEX. CAN YOU SHARE THE SCHEDULE. CAN YOU SHARE THE COSTS. WE'D LIKE TO KNOW THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE GALLERY. VERY GOOD ONE MOMENT. HELLO MY NAME IS KATE RILEY I AM A REPRESENTING- ALSO VOLUNTEER WITH PAC AND REPRESENTING TREES FOR SACRAMENTO ALSO WORKED IN THE ASSEMBLY FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS- WE WANT TO JUST SAY THAT WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED CONCERNED ABOUT THE PLAN- OUR ESTIMATE IS THAT T. STREET- THE TO THE DOUBLE T. DESIGN WHICH IS WHAT YOU'VE APPEARED OF SELECTED. IS THE ONE OF THE THREE THAT WERE CONSIDERED IN SEPTEMBER THAT REMOVED THE MOST TREES WE IF YOU DO NOT DO THE VISITOR CENTER THERE WILL STILL BE AT LEAST FIFTY FIVE TREES LARGE AND SMALL REMOVED- THREATENED DUE TO THE DOUBLETREE ANNEX BUILDING AND THE TWELFTH ST UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE SOME OF THEM MIGHT IT MAY INCLUDE A GIGANTIC SIKORA TWO HISTORIC HOMES THE LAST REMAINING OLD MAGNOLIA MAGNOLIA AND A COCKSPUR CORAL TREE. THAT WILL BE REMOVED IF THE TWELFTH STREET PARKING GARAGE IS BUILT THAT CORAL TREES THE LARGEST IN CALIFORNIA AND IS LISTED AS AN INTERNATIONAL MONUMENTAL TREE OVER SEVENTEEN FEET AROUND AT THE AT THE TRUNK NOW IF IT IT MAY BE PROPOSED FOR BEING MOVED BUT MOVING IS NOT THE SAME THING IS SAVING WHEN YOU HAVE A TREE OF THAT SIZE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO MOVE THOSE TREES AND SO YOU MAY OPTIMISTICALLY SAY THEY ARE SLATED FOR TO BE pMOVED BUT THEY MADE THAT AND- THEN PARRIS WITHIN YEARS. SO WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. ANYTHING THAT MOVES BEYOND THE EXISTING FOOTPRINT. OF THE STATE OF THE CAP THE HISTORIC CAPITOL ANNEX BECAUSE AS WE KNOW. THIS COMPLEX IS SURROUNDED BY TREES AND SO ANYTIME YOU GO OUTSIDE THE FOOTPRINT YOU'RE ENDANGERING TREES. AND WE BELIEVE THAT. WE ARE GLAD TO SEE THAT THE VISITOR CENTERS IS NOT IN THE SLIDES. BECAUSE THAT WOULD ALSO BRING ABOUT A DESTRUCTION OF TREES AS WELL AS- OF THE WEST PLAZA MEETING PLACE. AND SO WE THINK THAT. WE ARE ASKING THE JOINT RULES COMMITTEE. TO REJECT THE IDEA OF EXPANDING THE FOOTPRINT OF THE ANNEX AND TO REJECT THE VISITOR CENTER AND THE UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE AND INSTEAD. WORK TO REDUCE RE. APPEAL THE BILL TATE AND RESTORE. THE EXISTING AND HISTORIC ANNEX BUILDING THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ARE THERE ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES IN THE CHAMBERS. VERY GOOD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THREE STEP PLAN WITH TREES FOR SACRAMENTO- AND A FORMER LEGISLATIVE STAFFER. RESEARCH AGENCY SECRETARY AND DEPARTMENT EXECUTIVE- I WANT TO ASK WHAT THE ACTION IS BEING TAKEN TODAY ON THIS PROJECT WE'VE ASKED FOR BACKGROUND INFORMATION. FOR JUSTIFICATION OF THE DEMOLITION AND HAVE BEEN REFUSED OUR LEGISLATIVE. OPEN RECORDS ACT REQUEST WE WOULD LIKE TO NARROW- WHY THE PUBLIC CAN'T SEE YOUR JUSTIFICATION FOR DEMOLITION OF THE ANNEX BUILDING. ALSO THE ANNEX WEBSITE LACKS FULL REPORTS FROM YOUR CONSULTANTS SO IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT WHAT THIS PROJECT IS AN IMPACT TODAY. YOU HAVEN'T EVEN TALKED ABOUT THE VISITOR CENTER AS FAR AS WE KNOW. AND YET IT'S IN THE ER AND WILL BE APPROVED WHEN THE ER INSIDE. SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THE TOTAL PROJECT. FINALLY UNLIKE OTHER STATE PROJECTS WHICH I'VE WORKED ON IN MY PAST. THIS PROJECT HAS HAD NO FISCAL OVERSIGHT. NO REVIEW BY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LMAO AND THE CLASS OF THIS BUILDING SINCE WE ESTIMATE IS ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER SQUARE FOOT. COMPARED TO OTHER STATE BUILDINGS THAT HAD REVIEW SUCH AS YOUR SWING BUILDING. WHICH IS NINE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN DOLLARS PER SQUARE FOOT WHICH WAS MORE REASONABLE. SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE COSTS ARE GROWING AND HAVE DOUBLED IN TWO YEARS AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE A FULL EXPLANATION AND DISCUSSION OF THAT. AND FINALLY THE VISITOR CENTER ALONE HS GONE UP TO SAID EIGHT MILLION. FOR IF WE COULD GET ANSWERS ON THE FROM WE APPRECIATE TO SHARE WITH THE PUBLIC YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OR I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU IN THE GAS FOR YOUR PART OF TODAY AND- WE NOW GO TO THE PHONE INES OF I REQUEST OF THE MODERATE REMIND CALLERS HOW TO OPEN THIR LINES AND WE HAVE A TWO MINUTE.

THANK YOU AND WE DO HAVE A COMMENT. FROM LINE NUMBER EIGHTEEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. WHAT GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ANTHONY I AM A CERTIFIED ARBORIST WITHIN A FULL SPECIAL OCCASION. BY CHAIR THE PREFERABLE VALLEY CHAPTER OF THE CALIFORNIA URBAN FOREST COUNCIL- I WOULD WITHIN A TWENTY MINUTE WALK OF THE CAPITAL AND I REPRESENT URBAN. FORESTRY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WELL FOR SEVERAL I'D GET INTO-OF CAPITOL. TO REGIONAL AND NATIONAL GROUPS. PLANNERS URBAN FORESTRY PROFESSIONALS AS WELL MANY COMMUNITY AND GARDEN CLUBS. OF THE TREES ON THE CALIFORNIA GROUNDS ARE SIMPLY PHENOMENAL. MANY HAVE HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE OTHER REPRESENTS YET ANOTHER NATION. AND THE FEW OF THE OTHERS SPEAKERS OF MENTIONED ON SEVERAL OUR FIRE. SO ONE OF A KIND- OF. LIKE A STATE REPRESENT. THE OFTEN DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. I READ THE PROPOSAL AND I'VE LISTENED IN ON PREVIOUS PROJECT UPDATE. BUT A TRYING TO WATCH TODAY BY THE LIVE STREAM- IT WAS UNAVAILABLE I TRIED BOTH ON APPLE AND PC SO I COULD NOT FOLLOW ALONG VISUALLY BUT I COULD RESURGENT- I ALSO TRY TO GET INFORMATION FROM THE- THE WEBSITE I HAVE TO TELL YOU JUST- IT REALLY LACKS COMPREHENSIVE. INFORMATION THAT ANOTHER. BAKER MENTIONED THAT JUST. HOME AND IT OF THE OTHER MRS I TO ECHO THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT- BEING ABLE TO- LOOK AT THE BUDGET FOR THIS PROJECT IF IT IS A IS NOT AVAILABLE AND IT REALLY SHOULD BE ON FOOT THIS POINT- I IDEA. RIGHT OPPOSED TO THIS PLAN AND THIS PROCESS THE PROCESS ITSELF THE- BUT HAS NOT DOES NOT FEEL TRANSPARENT- AND- WITH THAT MIGHT MAKE CERTAIN OF HEIGHTENED ABOUT WHAT WHAT IS HAPPENING AND A LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHY. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK THE- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AT THE TIME OF THE CHAIR WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU. OKAY THEN THE ALL WE HAVE THREE PARTICIPANTS OUTSIDE THE BUILDING ON THE STEPS. STAFF THE NEW. WHAT ON. ALL RIGHT HERE WE DID AUDIO. HELLO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS- BRUCE LEE I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE SACRAMENTO TECH TAX COUNTY- TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION- JUST INSIDE AND PERHAPS I SHOULD THE STATE A FEW MOMENTS LONGER- BUT I THOUGHT THE PROGRAM WOULD BE GOING A BIT LONG SO I CAME OUTSIDE BUT FORTUNATELY I CAN STILL DRESS YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- OUR FOCUS TO IT WITH THE SECOND TO TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION IS TO. LOOK AT PROTECTING- TAXPAYERS RIGHTS AND LOOKING AT USING OUR TAX DOLLARS AS WISELY AS POSSIBLE. AND I'VE ACTUALLY WORKED IN THIS- CAPITOL BUILDING FOR MANY MANY YEARS AS YOU HAVE- WITH THE GOVERNOR'S DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND WHEN I WOULD ASK QUESTIONS- WHEN I PROPOSALS THAT WOULD COME TO ME THAT BE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THERE OR GREATER. I ALWAYS HAD TWO QUESTIONS ONE WAS DOES THIS MAKE SENSE AND SECONDLY IS. WORTH THE MONEY COMING FROM. AND I'M AFRAID IN THE INITIAL ANALYSIS OF THE KAPPA ANNEX PROJECT THAT'S BEING PROPOSED RIGHT NOW THAT WERE FAILING ON BOTH THOSE COUNTS. OF NOW IS REALLY A PIVOTAL TIME TO FOCUS ON OUR ECONOMY AND THE RECOVERY OF OUR ECONOMY- WE'RE PLEASED THAT THERE IS A- STATE BUDGET SURPLUS THAT MAY ALLOW US TO- HELP- TEND TO THE NEEDS OF CITIZENS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE RECOVERY PROCESS IS GOING TO BE A VERY LONG LONG ROAD. AND THIS IS A PROJECT. AND THE RESTORATION OF THE ANNEX IS IMPORTANT BUT THERE ARE LIKELY VERY. A NUMBER OF PLAUSIBLE ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE LESS COSTLY AND WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED AT THIS TIME- TAXPAYERS HAVE HAD TO TIGHTEN THEIR BELTS DURING THE PANDEMIC STORM. AND LIKE WISE WE NEED TO BE VERY THOUGHTFUL IN HOW WE APPROACH THIS AND OTHER OTHER SPENDING PROJECTS- WE HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY. AND THIS IS GOING TO BE A PROPOSAL THAT IS GOING TO BE A BURDEN FINANCIALLY UPON THIS STATE FOR DECADES TO COME- SO IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE'RE ESTIMATING THE COST OF FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR MILLION. BY A TWENTY TWENTY THAT COST ESTIMATE IS OVER ONE BILLION AND GROWING AND I THINK YOU CAN ALL AGREE THAT ONE BILLION DOLLARS CAN GO A LONG WAY TO ASSISTING THE CITIZENS OF OUR STATE. YEAH WE HAVE MANY OTHER PROJECT PRIORITIES PROGRAM PRIORITIES WILDFIRE FORCE PROTECTION PLANS ZERO MISSION AND- VEHICLE GOALS RELIEF FOR SMALL BUSINESS. THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE ARE CRITICAL FOR A STATE. AND AT THIS TIME I DON'T WANT TO FOR THIS TYPE OF PROJECT AT THIS POINT IN TIME IT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DELAYED IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE DONE BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AS- WAS BEING PREVIOUSLY SUGGESTED. ANY PERSONALLY FOR YOUR CAR ALSO SAID ON WHETHER OR NOT A TWO MINUTE RULE. IF YOU COULD CONCLUDE. WHEN IS IT MY TURN. I'M READY TO GO EXCELLENT RIGHT NOW SO I DON'T SIDE THE BUILDING TODAY. WHEN IS IT MY TURN. THIS IS CONFUSING TO ME WHAT'S GOING ON. DO I SPEAK. WHEN IS IT MY TURN.

COMMENTS THOSE WHO ALREADY WALK SUBMISSIVE LEE WILL SAY THERE IS NO CAUSE FOR ALARM. BUT SUBMISSIVENESS IS NOT OUR HERITAGE. THE FIRST AMENDMENT WAS DEVELOPED DESIGNS TO ALLOW REBELLION TO REMAIN AS OUR HERITAGE THE CONSTITUTION WAS DENIED DID WAS DESIGNED TO KEEP GOVERNMENT OFF THE BACKS OF THE PEOPLE THE BILL OF RIGHTS WAS ADDED TO KEEP THE PRECINCTS OF BELIEF AND EXPRESSION. THE PRESS OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ACTIVITIES FREE FROM SURVEILLANCE THE BILL OF RIGHTS WAS DESIGNED TO KEEP AGENTS OF GOVERNMENT AND OFFICIAL EAVESDROPPERS AWAY FROM THE ASSEMBLIES OF PEOPLE THE AIM WAS TO ALLOW MEN TO BE FREE AND INDEPENDENT. AND TO ASSERT THEIR RIGHTS AGAINST CORRUPT GOVERNMENTS LAYERED AND TATUM FORO EIGHT U. S. ONE NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO I WAS DENIED ENTRANCE TODAY TO THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE TO A PUBLIC HEARING. THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY OF THIS PROJECT IS SO SHAMEFUL I DON'T EVEN KNOW HAT TO SAY ABOUT IT I WAS IN THIS BUILDING KEN COOLEY WITH MY CHILDREN WHOM YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU ARE MY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ON FRIDAY.
