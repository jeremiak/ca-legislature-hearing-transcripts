RETAIL MARKET PLACES -- AS WE ARE MISSING AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE SALES TAXES.

GOOD AFTERNOON LAURA BENNETT WITH CALIFORNIA ADVISERS IN BEHALF OF AMAZON WENT THINK THE CHAIRS THE STRUCTURE FOR BRING THIS BEFORE IN ALL YOUR GOOD WORK THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MARTY TO CASSIE AND I WANTED TO THANK -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER BURKE CENTER REQUIRED OUR STATE TREASURER FIONA MA. WE LIKE THIS BILL BUT WE DON'T THINK THAT IT GOES QUITE FAR ENOUGH AND I WANT TO SPEAK TO ONE ASPECT OF THAT BILL BY WAY OF BACKGROUND. I AM AN ATTORNEY A TAX ATTORNEY AND A LITIGATOR MY PRACTICE FOCUSES ON CALIFORNIA TAXES PETE'S EXCLUSIVELY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR TWENTY YEARS. AND SO I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SALES TAX I REPRESENTED THE SITUATION NUMEROUS SMALL BUSINESSES WHO SELL AN ONLINE MARKETPLACES. AND FRANKLY MY PHONE HAS BEEN RINGING OFF THE HOOK IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS AS A CD TFA. TRYING TO DO A GOOD JOB BUT THEY HAVE LET'S JUST BE HONEST THEY'VE BEEN THREATENING A LOT OF THESE MOM AND POP OPERATORS WITH TAXES INTEREST AND PENALTIES. GOING BACK EIGHT YEARS AS WELL AS CRIMINAL PROSECUTION SOME CASES. AND THIS IS IN THE MARKET PLACE ON HAITIAN WHERE YOU HAVE AS AN EXAMPLE AMAZON FBA SELLERS. IN THEIR THREE POINTS I WANT TO MAKE LEGALLY AND AND ONE IS THAT. WHILE THE PROBLEM IS ADDRESS ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT ADDRESS ON A GOING BACKWARDS BASIS. AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THE LEGISLATION. AB SOME CLARIFYING LANGUAGE I THINK COULD BE APPROPRIATE HERE BECAUSE UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW WHICH HAS BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR AT LEAST SEVENTY TO EIGHTY YEARS. REGULATION FIFTEEN SIXTEEN I'D BEEN ON THE BOOKS ALL THIS TIME SAYS THAT AND I QUOTE A PERSON WHO HAS POSSESSION OF PROPERTY OWNED BY ANOTHER. AND ALSO THE POWER TO CALL ITS TITLE TO BE TRANSFERRED BY ANOTHER. THAT PERSON IS DEEMED TO BE THE RETAILER RIGHT SO WE HAVE THIS BEING TAKEN CARE OF ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS IT WOULD BE USEFUL WE HAVE LANGUAGE. TO TAKE CARE OF IT ON A GOING BACKWARDS BASIS IN CONFORMITY WITH EXISTING LAW WE ALSO HAVE A STATUTE SIX THOUSAND AND SEVEN WHICH ESSENTIALLY SAYS THE SAME THING. AND THEN THE THIRD AND FINAL POINT I WANNA MAKE FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE IS WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE CONTRACTS BETWEEN ONLINE MARKETPLACE FACILITATORS. AND THE SMALL BUSINESSES AND SOMETIMES THOSE CONTRACTS SAY -- THE SMALL BUSINESS AGREES TO BE THE RETAILER FOR SALES TAX PURPOSES WELL UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW YOU CANNOT CONTRACT AWAY. YOUR DUTIES AS A RETAILER. BY VIRTUE OF SIGNING A PIECE OF PAPER WITH SOMEBODY ELSE OBVIOUSLY. THAT WOULD OPEN THE DOOR TO A LOT OF OTHER PROBLEMS WE CAN JUST CREATE AN OFFSHORE COMPANY. HAVE A CONTRACT WITH AFTER COMPANIES MAKE THAT OFFSHORE COMPANY THE RETAILER AND OBVIATE AND RELIEVE THE ONLINE MARKETPLACE WITH SO TATER. FROM SALES TAXES. JUST IN SUMMARY I KNOW THIS IS A LITTLE BIT. I TRIED NOT TO BE TOO TECHNICAL BUT BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE HAVE LAW ON THE BOOKS. IN FORMA REGULATION AND FORMER STATUTE THAT. SHOULD CONFORM WITH THIS LEGISLATION THROUGH THE USE OF CLARIFYING LANGUAGE SIR THANK YOU THINK EVERY PATIENT LISTENING. APPRECIATED YOUR COMMENTS. HI MY NAME IS PAUL RIVALS AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A NONPROFIT AMAZON SELLER ORGANIZATION OR ICE THAT YOU COMMERCE ORGANIZATION ALL THE ONLINE MERCHANTS GUILD. I WANT TO THANK. BOTH SENATE AND ASSEMBLY WOMAN FOR INTRUSIONS BILL IT'S IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT STEP FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS AND OF COURSE I WANT TO THANK. THE MOST A TREASURE Mà WHO HAS BEEN. WHO CAN SPEAK FOR THE REAL NESS OF OUR MEMBERS AND THE FACT THAT THEY ARE? HUMAN BEINGS THE ARE NOT MICROSOFT THEIR THESE AND I USED TO WORK FOR IS A TAX LAWYER THESE ARE. SMALL KITCHEN TABLE ENTERPRISES PEOPLE WHO. MAY HAVE SOLD A MILLION DOLLARS WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY. BUT A MILLION DOLLAR SELLER AFTER THEY PAY AMAZON THEIR CUT. AFTER THE COST OF GOODS SOLD MAYBE EATING OUT OF SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR LIVING WHICH IN WESTERN KENTUCKY IS A GREAT LIVE IT. BUT NOW THEY'RE BEING TOLD BY THE CD TFA THAT THEY OWE THEIR LIFE SAVINGS TIMES. TEN TO THEM FOR FAILING TO COLLECT THE TAX FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS SIR IS EIGHT YEARS SIX EIGHT YEARS. THE TAX. ITSELF HAS BEEN COMPLICATED THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WAS EVEN QUOTED AS SAYING THEY THOUGHT AMAZON SHOULD A COLLECTING SALES TAX RESPECT TO THE SALES WHICH THEY PERFIL. THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MARKET PLACE. AND SO EVEN AS WE SPEAK TO AMAZON AND THE FOLKS THAT USE THESE FOR FILM AND PROGRAMS AND HAD NO IDEA. THAT EMINEM WAS TAKEN THEIR STUFF AND PUTTING IN CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE OTHER MARKET PLACES OUT THERE THAT DON'T DO THAT AND SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL TO KIND OF CAPTURE ALL OF THAT AND SO I COMMEND YOU FOR THAT BUT YOU KNOW WHEN WE SAY THINGS ARE NOT BEING RETROACTIVE KEEP IN MIND THAT. THERE'S SORT OF A A GAME BEING PLAYED AND YOU KNOW WHERE THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY THOSE THAT USE THE AMAZON FULFILLMENT CENTERS THOSE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE GETTING THE THE THE LETTERS CLAIMING THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE COMMITTING A FELONY THIS IS RAY. THAT'S THAT THEY ARE BEING PERSECUTED AND AND FORTY THOUSAND LETTERS WENT OUT TO SELLERS VERY RECENTLY SAYING. THAT DAY OWE BACK TAXES AND I'LL JUST SAY ONE MORE THING ABOUT THE AMAZON PLATFORM IT'S OFTEN REFERRED TO BY FOLKS THE COMMUNITIES THE GREAT EQUALIZER -- WOMEN ON BUSINESS ADVOCATES. HAVE SAID THAT YOU KNOW THE AMAZON IS GREAT WITH EQUALIZER DO ITS ABILITY REMOVED GENDER RACE NATIONAL OR NATIONAL ORIGIN OTHER REAL WORLD BIASES FROM. THE PICTURE AMAZONS MARKETPLACE AND OTHERS GIVE ENTREPRENEURS EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCCESS. LEADING ON THE MARKET THE MARKET BEING THE JUDGE OF WHAT SIXTIES AND WHAT DOESN'T. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE ACTUALLY HAD SOME OF OUR MEMBERS TELL YOU THAT THEMSELVES SO YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF JUST THE TYPE OF SUCCESS. THE BEAMS ON SELLER OFFERS YOU KNOW THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND ON AMAZON BUT UNFORTUNATE JUST SCARED. THEY FEEL THAT THEY HAVE A TARGET THAT BY BEING HERE. THEY WOULD HAVE A TARGET ON THE BACK BY THE CITY TFA AND EVEN AMAZON WOULD RETALIATE AGAINST THEIR BUSINESS. FOR BEING HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT THAT SO. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU AND FINALLY I WOULD JUST SAY THAT. THERE ARE FIVE MILLION SELLERS IN THE NIGHT IN THE WORLD. CALIFORNIA HAS THE LARGEST SELLER ECONOMY AND NOBODY EVEN ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THEY EXPECTS EXCEPT FOR TREASURE Và. A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES EXIST IN THE STATE SMALL BOATERS ARE SMALL BUSINESSES EXCUSE ME THAT WASN'T. AND SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE STATE THEY EMPLOY PEOPLE. OKAY THEY ARE AN ECONOMY AND NOT ONE PERSON IN THIS ROOM OTHER THAN TREASURE Mà HAS ACKNOWLEDGED. THAT THEY REALLY YOU KNOW REALLY HAS GONE OUT AND SPOKEN TO THEM ENGAGE THEM IN AS THE HARM THAT THEY'RE FACING. THE HARM THAT OUR SELLERS ARE FACING OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. THEY'RE GETTING IT TOO FOR MASSACHUSETTS WASHINGTON OTHER STATES ARE LOOKING TO CALIFORNIA WHO ALWAYS IS THE LEADER IN THESE SITUATIONS AND SAYING WE MADE IS THE SAME THING TO YOU. TEAR SELLERS SO. REALLY I HOPE YOU TAKE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO WORK WITH ORGANIZATION WORKERS TRUDGE MIND REALLY. FOR THE FIRST TIME ACTUALLY GET TO KNOW THE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE OPERATING IN THE STATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR COMMENTS THERE'S BEEN A MOTION AND A SECOND IF YOU PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS PRECISE THANK YOU VERY MUCH LENNY GOLDBERG -- EMERITUS FOR THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION AND I WANTED TO BE HERE BECAUSE WE STARTED THIS PROCESS IN. NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WITH INDEPENDENT BOOKSELLERS SEEING AMAZON TAKING THEIR MARKET AND NOT COLLECTING SALES TAX -- WE PARTICIPATED IN THE STREAMLINED SALES TAX PROCESS WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE VERY IMPORTANT WITH REGARD TO THE WAY FAIR DECISION BY THE COURT -- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS ONE THAT IS WORKABLE IS CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL LAW WE DO RESERVE THE RIGHT TO KEEP LOOKING AT IT AND SEEING IF IT'S WORKING RIGHT AS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAVE COMMENTED. THE MARKET PLACE PROVISION IS A VERY IMPORTANT ONE AND WE ALSO AGREE THAT FIVE THAT WITH SOUTH DAKOTA AT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WE'RE A LITTLE BIT BIGGER THAN THEM. SO THAT THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR -- THRESHOLD MAKES SENSE SO -- ALL THESE YEARS THAT THIS IS HAPPENING [inaudible] THANK YOU.

MADE THE I MEAN CEREBRAL IRONMEN SLIGHT GRADUALLY GESTURE THE THRESHOLDS FROM WHAT IS NORTH DAKOTA IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT WERE IN CAL QUE SO THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IS. IS GROSS SALES ARE TAXABLE SALES GROWTH [inaudible] TOTAL SALES. OKAY SO YOU'RE NOT. SURE YOU. I'M JUST TRYING TO GET AT WHETHER OR NOT ON TANGIBLE PURPOSE. SALES ON TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY NO NO I'M SORRY I DIDN'T MEAN THAT IN FRAZIER CORRECTLY SO.

SOME USE TAXES COLLECTED FOR SOME SELLERS RIGHT OTHERS IT IS NOT TO DO YOU SO DOES IT REMOVES. SO I'LL THAT AMAZON -- ANSWERS THEY LIKE TO SO RIGHT NOW AMAZON IS COLLECTING TAX ON AMAZON SPECIFIC PRODUCTS -- SO THIS WOULD NOW OF A FOR THIS USING THE AMAZON PLATFORM FOR EXAMPLE THIS WOULD BE ALL NINE AMAZON RELATED PRODUCTS SO THE ACTUAL BRAND OF AMAZON IF THEY'RE SELLING TO NOPE YOU'RE NOT UNDERSTANDING MY QUESTION -- OKAY OR DIG USE TAX COLLECTED IS THAT IS THAT REMOVED FROM THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR THRESHOLD DO YOU SEPARATE THAT OR IS IT JUST EVERYTHING IS PUT TOGETHER. SO THERE WERE NO TAXES ON THE INTEREST ON THE INTERNET SALES FOR PROP.
