00:41:48.206 --> 00:41:52.210 region:rollup2
MAKING POLICY DECISIONS BASED ON

00:41:50.675 --> 00:41:54.112 region:rollup2
DATA. AND THAT'S WHAT'S CRITICAL

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:55.513 region:rollup2
TO US AT THIS TIME UNFORTUNATELY

00:41:54.112 --> 00:41:56.748 region:rollup2

00:41:55.513 --> 00:41:59.250 region:rollup2
BILL. AND I'M GONNA GIVE YOU

00:41:56.748 --> 00:42:00.752 region:rollup2
SEVERAL REASONS WHY THAT IS TRUE

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:02.153 region:rollup2
THIS IS COMPLEX ISSUE.

00:42:00.752 --> 00:42:03.688 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THAT.

00:42:02.153 --> 00:42:05.223 region:rollup2
THE DATA THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED

00:42:03.688 --> 00:42:07.592 region:rollup2

HELPFUL THERE SOME DATA THAT'S

00:42:13.064 --> 00:42:15.266 region:rollup2
MISSING FROM THOSE REPORTS AND

00:42:14.132 --> 00:42:16.901 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THIS

00:42:15.266 --> 00:42:18.002 region:rollup2
REQUIRES RIGOROUS. SOME ACADEMIC

00:42:16.901 --> 00:42:20.171 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS THAT.

00:42:18.002 --> 00:42:20.972 region:rollup2
WHAT WE HEARD TODAY FROM THOSE

00:42:20.171 --> 00:42:22.540 region:rollup2
THAT ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL

00:42:20.972 --> 00:42:23.141 region:rollup2
I DIDN'T HEAR A WHOLE LOT ABOUT

WHERE THE CONSUMERS ARE GONNA

00:42:23.141 --> 00:42:26.844 region:rollup2
KILL? ONCE THERE IS A RATE CAP

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:28.913 region:rollup2

THEY DIDN'T SEE ANY INFLUX OF

00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:58.903 region:rollup2
NEW BORROWERS. BUT IN FACT THE

00:43:57.368 --> 00:44:01.272 region:rollup2
THAT THE PROPONENTS OF THE

FUND OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:10.581 region:rollup2
DOLLARS TO DO WITH THIS. THEM

00:44:08.246 --> 00:44:13.184 region:rollup2
DANCING ALONE OUT OF IT

00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:15.853 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS OF THE CREDIT

00:44:13.184 --> 00:44:17.722 region:rollup2

THERE ARE MORE COMPLAINT OR THAT

00:44:17.722 --> 00:44:26.230 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT

CREDIT PROBLEMS DIDN'T GO DOWN

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:27.398 region:rollup2
WHEN THE RATE RESTRICTIONS PUT

00:44:26.831 --> 00:44:27.999 region:rollup2
IN PLACE.

00:44:27.398 --> 00:44:28.666 region:rollup2
SO WHAT IS THAT SAYING THAT

00:44:27.999 --> 00:44:29.233 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT THIS DOES ELIMINATE

00:44:28.666 --> 00:44:29.867 region:rollup2
CREDIT THOSE CUSTOMERS THAT

00:44:29.233 --> 00:44:35.806 region:rollup2

00:44:38.209 --> 00:44:41.112 region:rollup2

ARE.

00:44:47.151 --> 00:44:49.987 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO

00:44:47.752 --> 00:44:52.156 region:rollup2
COULD GATHER MORE DATA SO UP OR

00:44:49.987 --> 00:44:53.925 region:rollup2

00:45:16.113 --> 00:45:19.650 region:rollup2

CREDIT.

00:45:26.424 --> 00:45:29.393 region:rollup2

.

00:45:47.211 --> 00:45:50.314 region:rollup2
RESTRICTING THESE CALIFORNIANS

00:45:48.446 --> 00:45:51.916 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO CREDIT DOES NOTHING TO

ADDRESS THEIR UNDERLYING NEED

00:45:51.916 --> 00:45:54.986 region:rollup2
FOR CREDIT JUST MAKES IT HARDER

00:45:53.451 --> 00:45:57.088 region:rollup2
FOR THEM TO GET A LOAN WHEN THEY

00:46:19.744 --> 00:46:22.747 region:rollup2
SOLE PROPRIETORS.

00:46:21.612 --> 00:46:24.048 region:rollup2
INSTEAD CALIFORNIA SHOULD FOCUS

00:46:22.747 --> 00:46:24.515 region:rollup2
ON PROTECTING CONSUMERS ACCESS

00:46:24.048 --> 00:46:26.250 region:rollup2

ENSURING THAT CONSUMERS COULD

PAY BACK THERE ARE THEIR LOANS

00:46:31.889 --> 00:46:35.426 region:rollup2
IS NOT ONLY THE RIGHT THING TO

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:36.494 region:rollup2
DO. IT IS ALSO GOOD FOR BUSINESS

00:46:35.426 --> 00:46:38.462 region:rollup2
BUT ATTEMPTING TO ACHIEVE THIS

00:46:36.494 --> 00:46:39.730 region:rollup2
GOAL THROUGH RATE CAPS AND OTHER

GET.

00:53:15.993 --> 00:53:19.963 region:rollup2
DATA FIRST OF ALL I THINK YOU

00:53:18.395 --> 00:53:21.999 region:rollup2
MAY HAVE ALREADY SAID THIS BUT

00:53:19.963 --> 00:53:24.234 region:rollup2
HOW MANY STATES ACTUALLY HAVE A

00:53:21.999 --> 00:53:25.836 region:rollup2
CAP OF THIRTY SIX.

00:53:24.234 --> 00:53:27.137 region:rollup2
.

00:53:25.836 --> 00:53:29.239 region:rollup2
IN THE SPACE OF TWENTY FIVE

00:53:27.137 --> 00:53:30.974 region:rollup2
HUNDRED TO FIVE THOUSAND.

00:53:29.239 --> 00:53:32.443 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE IS TWENTY ONE

00:53:30.974 --> 00:53:34.511 region:rollup2
TWENTY ONE OF THEM.

00:53:32.443 --> 00:53:37.081 region:rollup2
TWENTY ONE STATES AND. IS THERE

00:53:34.511 --> 00:53:38.816 region:rollup2
DATA TO SHOW WHAT THE IMPACT OF

00:53:37.081 --> 00:53:40.150 region:rollup2
THE EFFECT OF THAT CAP.

00:53:38.816 --> 00:53:44.254 region:rollup2
DOES.

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:46.290 region:rollup2
WHEN IT'S INSTITUTED.

00:53:44.254 --> 00:53:47.191 region:rollup2
WELL THERE'S BEEN. YOU KNOW THAT

00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:48.392 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT PART OF

00:53:47.191 --> 00:53:50.127 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE BUT GIVEN THE FACT

00:53:48.392 --> 00:53:51.228 region:rollup2
THAT WE DON'T.

00:53:50.127 --> 00:53:51.895 region:rollup2
GET DATA AND ASIDE FROM THE

00:53:51.228 --> 00:53:54.698 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY.

00:53:51.895 --> 00:53:56.567 region:rollup2
THAT LEADS TO GET IT FROM.

00:53:54.698 --> 00:53:58.669 region:rollup2
THE THE AND THE STATE'S ABILITY

00:53:56.567 --> 00:53:59.670 region:rollup2
TO GET DATA AND DIFFERENT STATES

00:53:58.669 --> 00:54:02.306 region:rollup2
HAVE DIFFERENT.

00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:03.707 region:rollup2
I OPPORTUNITY GET DATA AND SO WE

00:54:02.306 --> 00:54:05.242 region:rollup2
HAVE SEEN IN SOME AND SAYS I

00:54:03.707 --> 00:54:07.111 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT. ALTHOUGH THE MOVES

00:54:05.242 --> 00:54:07.811 region:rollup2
INDICATION FOR THE REQUEST FOR

00:54:07.111 --> 00:54:10.280 region:rollup2
RIGOROUS ACADEMIC ANALYSIS.

00:54:07.811 --> 00:54:12.049 region:rollup2
.

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:12.883 region:rollup2
IT WILL IT WAS REALLY FOLLOWED

00:54:12.049 --> 00:54:13.984 region:rollup2
UP WITH ANECDOTES WITH THINGS

00:54:12.883 --> 00:54:15.352 region:rollup2
THAT HAPPENED URBAN STATES WE

00:54:13.984 --> 00:54:16.487 region:rollup2
HAVE SEEN THAT IN SOME STATES

00:54:15.352 --> 00:54:17.988 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY

00:54:16.487 --> 00:54:21.024 region:rollup2
ONCE YOU ACTUALLY ALLOW THE CAPS

00:54:17.988 --> 00:54:22.392 region:rollup2
TO BE IN PLACE. THE ABILITY FOR

00:54:21.024 --> 00:54:24.495 region:rollup2
A WEATHERBY NONPROFITS WHETHER

00:54:22.392 --> 00:54:26.730 region:rollup2
IT BE BIG GOVERNMENT ENTITIES OR

00:54:24.495 --> 00:54:27.331 region:rollup2
CREDIT UNIONS TO FILL THAT GAP.

00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:29.066 region:rollup2
THEY CAN'T DO THAT WHEN THEIR

00:54:27.331 --> 00:54:31.702 region:rollup2
IS.

00:54:29.066 --> 00:54:33.437 region:rollup2
THOUGH THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:54:31.702 --> 00:54:35.839 region:rollup2
OF MARKETING OF THAT FRANKLY

00:54:33.437 --> 00:54:36.573 region:rollup2
EVEN KEEP.

00:54:35.839 --> 00:54:38.175 region:rollup2
IN SOME CASES.

00:54:36.573 --> 00:54:39.543 region:rollup2
WILL CUSTOMERS FROM GOING TO

00:54:38.175 --> 00:54:41.078 region:rollup2
THE MORE RESPONSIBLE LENDERS

00:54:39.543 --> 00:54:43.580 region:rollup2
THAT ARE CLOSER TO THE AND

00:54:41.078 --> 00:54:44.515 region:rollup2
AROUND THIRTY SIX PERCENT RANGE.

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:45.382 region:rollup2
I SAID YOU HAVE A MORE

00:54:44.515 --> 00:54:46.550 region:rollup2
INFORMATION COULD MASK

00:54:45.382 --> 00:54:48.285 region:rollup2
OSCILLATORY SPEAKS SPECIFICALLY

00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:49.553 region:rollup2
TO SOME OF THE DATA FROM OTHER

00:54:48.285 --> 00:54:50.954 region:rollup2
STATES YES PLEASE THANK YOU.

00:54:49.553 --> 00:54:51.688 region:rollup2
REPEAT THE THE DATE I'M I'M JUST

00:54:50.954 --> 00:54:54.358 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR.

00:54:51.688 --> 00:54:55.959 region:rollup2
WHAT KIND OF DATA IS OUT THERE?

00:54:54.358 --> 00:54:57.761 region:rollup2
FOR THE STATE'S THAT DID

00:54:55.959 --> 00:54:59.796 region:rollup2
INSTITUTE A CAP.

00:54:57.761 --> 00:55:01.031 region:rollup2
BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND

00:54:59.796 --> 00:55:02.1000 region:rollup2
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OKAY I

00:55:01.031 --> 00:55:04.268 region:rollup2
THINK YET SO THE THE MOST RECENT

00:55:02.1000 --> 00:55:05.769 region:rollup2
REPORT THAT WE HAVE ON THAT IS

00:55:04.268 --> 00:55:07.905 region:rollup2
FROM THE NATIONAL CONSUMER LAW

00:55:05.769 --> 00:55:08.505 region:rollup2
CENTER. IN THE STUDY THAT THEY

00:55:07.905 --> 00:55:10.574 region:rollup2
DID IS ACTIONS BUT

00:55:08.505 --> 00:55:11.742 region:rollup2
TO A TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR LOAN

00:55:10.574 --> 00:55:14.745 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE ARE THIRTY FOUR

00:55:11.742 --> 00:55:16.413 region:rollup2
STATES THAT HAVE. THIRTY SIX

00:55:14.745 --> 00:55:18.816 region:rollup2
PERCENT AND LOSS OF A. VOTE OF

00:55:16.413 --> 00:55:20.784 region:rollup2
ANY PR FOR THOSE SPECIFIC LOANS.

00:55:18.816 --> 00:55:22.519 region:rollup2
UP SO THERE IS NOT A SPECIFIC

00:55:20.784 --> 00:55:23.954 region:rollup2
STUDY OF THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED

00:55:22.519 --> 00:55:26.290 region:rollup2
TO TEN AT THIS POINT.

00:55:23.954 --> 00:55:27.624 region:rollup2
SO SPEAKING TO AND THE SORT OF

00:55:26.290 --> 00:55:30.494 region:rollup2
THE ANECDOTAL OF OF WHAT IS

00:55:27.624 --> 00:55:32.196 region:rollup2
SPEAKING PEW DID DO A STUDY

00:55:30.494 --> 00:55:34.798 region:rollup2
OUGHT SAID LOOK AT WHAT HAS

00:55:32.196 --> 00:55:36.533 region:rollup2
HAPPENED AFTER RATE CAPS AND AND

00:55:34.798 --> 00:55:37.901 region:rollup2
AND BASICALLY. FOLKS ARE GOING

00:55:36.533 --> 00:55:40.437 region:rollup2
BACK TO WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE

00:55:37.901 --> 00:55:42.539 region:rollup2
DONE ORIGINALLY BEFORE GOING TO

00:55:40.437 --> 00:55:44.575 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHAT YOU FOUND SO.

00:55:42.539 --> 00:55:46.710 region:rollup2
BORROWING FROM FAMILY AND

00:55:44.575 --> 00:55:48.545 region:rollup2
FRIENDS GOING TO PAWN SHOPS.

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:50.914 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THESE ARE THINGS THAT

00:55:48.545 --> 00:55:53.217 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HAD TO DO TO ACTUALLY GET

00:55:50.914 --> 00:55:54.518 region:rollup2
OUT OF IT AND WHAT THEY WOULD

00:55:53.217 --> 00:55:56.253 region:rollup2
HAVE CHOSEN TO DO IN THE FIRST

00:55:54.518 --> 00:55:58.589 region:rollup2
PLACE. ON IF I CAN GIVE ONE

00:55:56.253 --> 00:56:02.993 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA EXAMPLE OF A PERSON

00:55:58.589 --> 00:56:04.561 region:rollup2
WHO GOT A CAR TITLE LOAN SHE I I

00:56:02.993 --> 00:56:08.398 region:rollup2
THINK I MENTIONED THIS TO YOU.

00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:08.865 region:rollup2
TO YOU BEFORE ABOUT IT'S A CAR

00:56:08.398 --> 00:56:09.166 region:rollup2
TITLE LOAN AND IT WAS.

00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:11.235 region:rollup2
.

00:56:09.166 --> 00:56:11.902 region:rollup2
LIKE TWO HUNDRED PERCENT APR IN

00:56:11.235 --> 00:56:12.436 region:rollup2
AND RIGHT I APPRECIATE THAT IT

00:56:11.902 --> 00:56:14.838 region:rollup2
DOES BUT I'M LOOKING FOR.

00:56:12.436 --> 00:56:17.140 region:rollup2
SOLID DATA.

00:56:14.838 --> 00:56:19.076 region:rollup2
IOWA AND THAT IS HERE SO MAYBE

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:20.577 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION WOULD THAT MOVEMENT

00:56:19.076 --> 00:56:22.980 region:rollup2
BUT WHATEVER I COULD WHAT WENT

00:56:20.577 --> 00:56:23.680 region:rollup2
BEFORE IT IF I COULD. GIVE YOU

00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:24.581 region:rollup2
ONE.

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:26.049 region:rollup2
PIECE OF DATA THAT I THINK IS

00:56:24.581 --> 00:56:27.217 region:rollup2
RELEVANT UP BECAUSE WHEN THE

00:56:26.049 --> 00:56:28.852 region:rollup2
PILOT WAS PUT IN PLACE WAS ALSO

00:56:27.217 --> 00:56:29.519 region:rollup2
ARGUMENTS THAT IT OF THE MARKET

00:56:28.852 --> 00:56:30.120 region:rollup2
THOUGH THE WILL BE NOT BE ACCESS

00:56:29.519 --> 00:56:30.787 region:rollup2
TO CREDIT. WHAT WE FOUND WAS

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:32.256 region:rollup2
FROM TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN A TWO

00:56:30.787 --> 00:56:33.323 region:rollup2
THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE REDUCTION

00:56:32.256 --> 00:56:34.591 region:rollup2
INCREASE OF APPLICATIONS OF A

00:56:33.323 --> 00:56:36.460 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN PERCENT INCREASE

00:56:34.591 --> 00:56:38.362 region:rollup2
APPLICATIONS AND LOAN APPROVAL

00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:40.264 region:rollup2
RATES INCREASE OF FIFTY PERCENT?

00:56:38.362 --> 00:56:42.933 region:rollup2
FIFTY TWO POINT FOUR PERCENT

00:56:40.264 --> 00:56:43.700 region:rollup2
DURING THAT TIME PERIOD AND SO

00:56:42.933 --> 00:56:46.236 region:rollup2
THAT'S.

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:47.771 region:rollup2
THAT'S HARD DATA BUT IS A PILOT

00:56:46.236 --> 00:56:48.405 region:rollup2
PROGRAM BUT WITH THREE HUNDRED

00:56:47.771 --> 00:56:50.240 region:rollup2
TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS

00:56:48.405 --> 00:56:51.642 region:rollup2
THAT SHOWS THAT THE MARKET

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:53.310 region:rollup2
DOESN'T GO AWAY. THAT IMPACT

00:56:51.642 --> 00:56:55.078 region:rollup2
THEIR STILL ACCESS

00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:56.313 region:rollup2
AND DIED OF EVEN IN NUMBER OF

00:56:55.078 --> 00:56:57.714 region:rollup2
APPLICATIONS ACTUALLY WENT UP

00:56:56.313 --> 00:56:59.383 region:rollup2
DURING THAT TIME PERIOD. AND

00:56:57.714 --> 00:57:00.784 region:rollup2
WOULD OPPOSITION HAVE DATA THAT

00:56:59.383 --> 00:57:02.452 region:rollup2
WOULD REFUTE THAT WELL IF WE IF

00:57:00.784 --> 00:57:03.620 region:rollup2
IF WERE POINTING TO THE PILOT

00:57:02.452 --> 00:57:05.088 region:rollup2
PROGRAM I WOULD SAY THOUGH IN

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:06.623 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THERE'S A

00:57:05.088 --> 00:57:07.925 region:rollup2
HUNDRED NINETY FIVE LONG HUNDRED

00:57:06.623 --> 00:57:09.259 region:rollup2
NINETY FIVE THOUSAND LOANS UNDER

00:57:07.925 --> 00:57:11.228 region:rollup2
THE PILOT. IN TWO THOUSAND

00:57:09.259 --> 00:57:13.730 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN IT WENT UP SIX THOUSAND

00:57:11.228 --> 00:57:15.966 region:rollup2
LOANS COMPARED. TO OVER TWELVE

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:17.601 region:rollup2
MILLION PAYDAY LOANS DURING THAT

00:57:15.966 --> 00:57:19.069 region:rollup2
SAME PERIOD OF TIME EVERY YEAR.

00:57:17.601 --> 00:57:20.837 region:rollup2
PAYDAY LENDERS DO MORE PILOTS IT

00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:22.673 region:rollup2
DIDN'T DO MORE LOANS THAN PILOT

00:57:20.837 --> 00:57:24.574 region:rollup2
LENDERS DO THEY DO WITH THEM IN

00:57:22.673 --> 00:57:25.342 region:rollup2
THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF. OF

00:57:24.574 --> 00:57:26.977 region:rollup2
JANUARY THE PILOT PROGRAM

00:57:25.342 --> 00:57:28.512 region:rollup2
LENDERS DO ALL YEAR LONG I THINK

00:57:26.977 --> 00:57:31.081 region:rollup2
THE PILOT PROGRAM WAS A ATTEMPT

00:57:28.512 --> 00:57:32.649 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO SATISFY UNDER TWENTY

00:57:31.081 --> 00:57:34.017 region:rollup2
FIVE HUNDRED BUT THE DATA SHOWS.

00:57:32.649 --> 00:57:35.619 region:rollup2
THERE ARE NOT MANY PILOT LOOK

00:57:34.017 --> 00:57:36.186 region:rollup2
PROGRAM LENDERS I BELIEVE

00:57:35.619 --> 00:57:36.987 region:rollup2
THERE'S ONLY THREE OR FOUR

00:57:36.186 --> 00:57:38.922 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING ANY

00:57:36.987 --> 00:57:41.224 region:rollup2
LANDING. AND CUSTOMERS ARE STILL

00:57:38.922 --> 00:57:43.093 region:rollup2
GOING TO DIFFERENT FINANCIAL

00:57:41.224 --> 00:57:44.728 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS SUMMER TO OUR

00:57:43.093 --> 00:57:46.163 region:rollup2
MEMBERS TO GET WHAT THEY NEED.

00:57:44.728 --> 00:57:47.531 region:rollup2
UP AND THEN IT'S FOR SOME OF THE

00:57:46.163 --> 00:57:49.066 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES THERE'S BEEN

00:57:47.531 --> 00:57:51.068 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATE REPORTS THAT SHOWS.

00:57:49.066 --> 00:57:52.169 region:rollup2
THAT COMPLAINTS HAVE GONE UP IN

00:57:51.068 --> 00:57:53.670 region:rollup2
NEW YORK OF IN YOUR FEDERAL

00:57:52.169 --> 00:57:55.806 region:rollup2
RESERVE DID A STUDY YEARS AGO

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:57.441 region:rollup2
THAT SHOWED WHEN. I'M ACCESS TO

00:57:55.806 --> 00:58:00.243 region:rollup2
CREDIT WAS DENIED IN NORTH

00:57:57.441 --> 00:58:01.812 region:rollup2
CAROLINA. CLUB AND GEORGIA IT

00:58:00.243 --> 00:58:03.280 region:rollup2
SHOWED THAT THERE WERE INCREASES

00:58:01.812 --> 00:58:06.049 region:rollup2
AND WATCH LIKE I MENTION OUR

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:07.184 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY THOSE NEGATIVE EFFECTS

00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:08.151 region:rollup2
THAT I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED.

00:58:07.184 --> 00:58:09.686 region:rollup2
OKAY OF AYE AND I APPRECIATE

00:58:08.151 --> 00:58:11.822 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:58:09.686 --> 00:58:14.057 region:rollup2
STILL LOOKING FOR SOME SOLID

00:58:11.822 --> 00:58:15.959 region:rollup2
GROUND ON ON ON THE DATA THERE.

00:58:14.057 --> 00:58:17.294 region:rollup2
WHAT TERM JUST REAL QUICK I

00:58:15.959 --> 00:58:19.496 region:rollup2
DON'T OVER THERE WOULD BE FROM

00:58:17.294 --> 00:58:22.499 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY OR WHAT BHUTTO WENT IS

00:58:19.496 --> 00:58:24.534 region:rollup2
THE LOOK OF DENIAL RATE RIGHT

00:58:22.499 --> 00:58:26.303 region:rollup2
NOW UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM FOR

00:58:24.534 --> 00:58:27.671 region:rollup2
LOANS BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE

00:58:26.303 --> 00:58:29.072 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND?

00:58:27.671 --> 00:58:31.908 region:rollup2
WOULD ANYBODY HAVE THAT

00:58:29.072 --> 00:58:34.911 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AS FAR AS WHAT.

00:58:31.908 --> 00:58:37.080 region:rollup2
AND. WE APPROVED ABOUT ONE HALF

00:58:34.911 --> 00:58:39.149 region:rollup2
OF ALL LOAN APPLICATIONS THAT WE

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:41.084 region:rollup2
RECEIVED LAST CALENDAR YEAR OKAY

00:58:39.149 --> 00:58:42.819 region:rollup2
SO OUT OF THAT ONE HALF.

00:58:41.084 --> 00:58:45.789 region:rollup2
HOW MANY OF THOSE LOANS WOULD

00:58:42.819 --> 00:58:47.391 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ENTER INTO A A DEFAULT

00:58:45.789 --> 00:58:49.593 region:rollup2
STATE IT IF THERE WAS THIS STATE

00:58:47.391 --> 00:58:51.461 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT HOW MANY OF THOSE

00:58:49.593 --> 00:58:52.529 region:rollup2
LOANS WOULD GO INTO DEFAULT?

00:58:51.461 --> 00:58:53.864 region:rollup2
SO ARE DEFAULT WE.

00:58:52.529 --> 00:58:55.565 region:rollup2
.

00:58:53.864 --> 00:58:57.467 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT OF

00:58:55.565 --> 00:58:59.403 region:rollup2
OUR LOANS THAT WE ORIGINALLY IN

00:58:57.467 --> 00:59:00.704 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA DO OF THE LOAN AMOUNT

00:58:59.403 --> 00:59:02.639 region:rollup2
THAT WE ORIGINALLY IN CALIFORNIA

00:59:00.704 --> 00:59:04.341 region:rollup2
DOES END UP IN THE FALL. SO IF

00:59:02.639 --> 00:59:06.376 region:rollup2
THEY END UP THAT YOU'RE TALKING

00:59:04.341 --> 00:59:07.310 region:rollup2
ABOUT A THIRD OF THE LOANS

00:59:06.376 --> 00:59:08.612 region:rollup2
RICHARD GIVING OUT END UP IN THE

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:10.113 region:rollup2
FALL SO NOW I'M STARTING SEE WHY

00:59:08.612 --> 00:59:10.280 region:rollup2
IT'S SO EXPENSIVE.

00:59:10.113 --> 00:59:12.082 region:rollup2
SO.

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:13.216 region:rollup2
.

00:59:12.082 --> 00:59:14.851 region:rollup2
OUT OF THAT THIRD THE END UP IN

00:59:13.216 --> 00:59:16.653 region:rollup2
DEFAULT.

00:59:14.851 --> 00:59:19.156 region:rollup2
HOW MANY OF THE THIRD DO YOU

00:59:16.653 --> 00:59:20.290 region:rollup2
CHARGE OFF SO FOR THE UNSECURED

00:59:19.156 --> 00:59:21.792 region:rollup2
IT IS IT'S ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT

00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:23.627 region:rollup2
OF THE AMOUNT THAT WE ORIGINATE

00:59:21.792 --> 00:59:25.328 region:rollup2
FOR AUTO TITLE LOANS IT'S IN THE

00:59:23.627 --> 00:59:27.531 region:rollup2
HIGH TEENS?

00:59:25.328 --> 00:59:29.399 region:rollup2
I WOULD COUPLE THAT NUMBER WITH

00:59:27.531 --> 00:59:31.668 region:rollup2
OUR ACTUAL AND WE PUBLICLY

00:59:29.399 --> 00:59:33.136 region:rollup2
REPORT OUR NUMBERS ARE A NET

00:59:31.668 --> 00:59:35.305 region:rollup2
MARGINS LAST YEAR WERE FIVE

00:59:33.136 --> 00:59:36.873 region:rollup2
POINT ONE PERCENT.

00:59:35.305 --> 00:59:39.142 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU CAN SEE IT IS VERY FOR

00:59:36.873 --> 00:59:40.944 region:rollup2
OUR CUSTOMER BASE UNDERWRITING

00:59:39.142 --> 00:59:43.647 region:rollup2
OUR CUSTOMER IS A VERY DIFFICULT

00:59:40.944 --> 00:59:44.981 region:rollup2
THING TO DO. BUT WE TRY OUR BEST

00:59:43.647 --> 00:59:46.983 region:rollup2
TO SERVICE OUR CUSTOMERS.

00:59:44.981 --> 00:59:48.652 region:rollup2
OKAY SO YOU A THE WAY YOU

00:59:46.983 --> 00:59:51.755 region:rollup2
SERVICE YOUR CUSTOMER.

00:59:48.652 --> 00:59:53.523 region:rollup2
THEN IS BY ALLOWING ACCESS TO

00:59:51.755 --> 00:59:54.925 region:rollup2
CAPITAL THAT OTHERWISE THEY

00:59:53.523 --> 00:59:57.527 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE NEVER HAD ACCESS TO.

00:59:54.925 --> 00:59:59.930 region:rollup2
AT A VERY HIGH RISK.

00:59:57.527 --> 01:00:02.099 region:rollup2
CORRECT OKAY SO.

00:59:59.930 --> 01:00:04.301 region:rollup2
BASICALLY THEN IT.

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:06.670 region:rollup2
CAN I GO BACK TO THE. THE THIRD

01:00:04.301 --> 01:00:08.038 region:rollup2
THAT ENDS UP IN DEFAULT.

01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:09.873 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH OF THAT PERCENT

01:00:08.038 --> 01:00:11.608 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ENDS UP BEING CHARGED

01:00:09.873 --> 01:00:13.510 region:rollup2
OFF OF THE THIRD?

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:15.278 region:rollup2
IS THAT THE WHOLE THIRD THE GETS

01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:16.880 region:rollup2
CHARGED OFF OR IS IT.

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:18.248 region:rollup2
WE CAN LOOK IF YOU IF YOU DON'T

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:19.182 region:rollup2
MIND WE CAN LOOK AT THE PILOT

01:00:18.248 --> 01:00:20.550 region:rollup2
PROGRAM BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN THAT

01:00:19.182 --> 01:00:22.486 region:rollup2
IS SET AT THIRTY SIX PERCENT

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:23.720 region:rollup2
WERE RESTRICTING. OF ACCESS

01:00:22.486 --> 01:00:25.188 region:rollup2
UNDER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED I

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.989 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WE DO HAVE NUMBERS

01:00:25.188 --> 01:00:26.456 region:rollup2
FROM THE REPORTS FROM THE

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:28.058 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:28.625 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT.

01:00:28.058 --> 01:00:31.128 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THAT SHOWS AND THE

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:33.330 region:rollup2
PILOT THAT ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:34.764 region:rollup2
OF LOANS GO INTO DEFAULT AT SOME

01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:36.566 region:rollup2
POINT THEY'RE LATE PAYMENTS.

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:37.734 region:rollup2
AND THEN OF THOSE THIRTY PERCENT

01:00:36.566 --> 01:00:40.437 region:rollup2
THE CHARGE OFF RATE I BELIEVE

01:00:37.734 --> 01:00:41.671 region:rollup2
IT'S TEN PERCENT OKAY END UP AND

01:00:40.437 --> 01:00:43.073 region:rollup2
TEN PERCENT COMPARED TO LET'S

01:00:41.671 --> 01:00:44.941 region:rollup2
SAY IF WE GO BACK TO PAY DAYS

01:00:43.073 --> 01:00:45.475 region:rollup2
BEING A SMALL DOLLAR EXAMPLE.

01:00:44.941 --> 01:00:46.710 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE MORE LIKE THREE

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:48.712 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:49.980 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE SAYING THAT IT'S A.

01:00:48.712 --> 01:00:51.281 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS SO THAT

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:53.683 region:rollup2
WOULD MAKE SENSE THEM WHEN YOU

01:00:51.281 --> 01:00:55.352 region:rollup2
SAID FIVE. THINGS FIVE POINT

01:00:53.683 --> 01:00:56.953 region:rollup2
SOMETHING PERCENT CORRECT ARE

01:00:55.352 --> 01:00:57.587 region:rollup2
YOU RIGHT CREDITS LAST YEAR

01:00:56.953 --> 01:00:57.854 region:rollup2
PROFIT MARGIN WAS FIVE POINT ONE

01:00:57.587 --> 01:01:00.323 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:00:57.854 --> 01:01:01.725 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:03.226 region:rollup2
THE PROFIT MARGIN FOR THE AND

01:01:01.725 --> 01:01:05.028 region:rollup2
YES FOR OUR COMPANY FOR YOUR

01:01:03.226 --> 01:01:05.629 region:rollup2
COMPANY OKAY SO I WAS ACTUALLY

01:01:05.028 --> 01:01:07.097 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR THE ACTUAL CHARGE

01:01:05.629 --> 01:01:08.832 region:rollup2
OFF.

01:01:07.097 --> 01:01:11.768 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WHAT I'M TRYING TO

01:01:08.832 --> 01:01:13.136 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT IS YOU HAVE TO. YOU

01:01:11.768 --> 01:01:14.638 region:rollup2
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY IN

01:01:13.136 --> 01:01:15.739 region:rollup2
ORDER TO STAY IN BUSINESS.

01:01:14.638 --> 01:01:19.442 region:rollup2
YOU'VE GOT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT

01:01:15.739 --> 01:01:21.044 region:rollup2
A WAY TO SUBSIDIZE AND COVER FOR

01:01:19.442 --> 01:01:22.579 region:rollup2
THE CHARGE OFFS.

01:01:21.044 --> 01:01:24.347 region:rollup2
AT A HIGH RISK IN A HIGH RISK

01:01:22.579 --> 01:01:26.049 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:26.683 region:rollup2
IS THAT RIGHT. WELL YES I ALSO

01:01:26.049 --> 01:01:28.118 region:rollup2
LIKE TO MAKE THIS POINT SOURCE

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:29.219 region:rollup2
THE COST IS OBVIOUSLY THAT'S

01:01:28.118 --> 01:01:31.054 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT WHY

01:01:29.219 --> 01:01:31.888 region:rollup2
ARE THESE LOANS BEING CHARGED AT

01:01:31.054 --> 01:01:33.557 region:rollup2
THIS RATE THAT WAS MY NEXT

01:01:31.888 --> 01:01:34.457 region:rollup2
QUESTION RIGHT SO WHAT WHY IS

01:01:33.557 --> 01:01:35.559 region:rollup2
THAT OCCURRING WELL IF YOU LOOK

01:01:34.457 --> 01:01:36.993 region:rollup2
AT THE COST STRUCTURE AND I.

01:01:35.559 --> 01:01:38.094 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S WHAT THE REASON WE

01:01:36.993 --> 01:01:40.063 region:rollup2
NEED TO DO A BIT BETTER ANALYSIS

01:01:38.094 --> 01:01:42.499 region:rollup2
THE. THE CFL AND REPORT

01:01:40.063 --> 01:01:43.400 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATES A LOT OF COMPANIES

01:01:42.499 --> 01:01:43.934 region:rollup2
RIGHT INTO HIM MORTGAGE LENDERS

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:45.802 region:rollup2
IN THEIR.

01:01:43.934 --> 01:01:47.737 region:rollup2
AUTO TITLE LENDERS INSTALLMENT

01:01:45.802 --> 01:01:49.139 region:rollup2
LENDERS ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:01:47.737 --> 01:01:50.407 region:rollup2
TYPES OF LENDERS AND SO IT'S ALL

01:01:49.139 --> 01:01:51.841 region:rollup2
BLENDED IT MAKES IT VERY

01:01:50.407 --> 01:01:53.410 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO LOOK AT EXACT DATA.

01:01:51.841 --> 01:01:55.245 region:rollup2
FOR THIS PARTICULAR PART OF THE

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:59.182 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY BUT WHAT WE DO SEE IS

01:01:55.245 --> 01:02:00.717 region:rollup2
THAT. OUR TYPE OF COMPANIES WE

01:01:59.182 --> 01:02:01.251 region:rollup2
MEET WITH THE CUSTOMERS.

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:01.918 region:rollup2
MAJORITY TUMBLE ITEMS ARE

01:02:01.251 --> 01:02:02.886 region:rollup2
STOREFRONTS WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE

01:02:01.918 --> 01:02:04.220 region:rollup2
CUSTOMER NOT ONLY DO THEY TAKE

01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:05.455 region:rollup2
UP A LOT OF THE STUFF AT THE

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:06.890 region:rollup2
STORE FRONT. WHICH REQUIRES

01:02:05.455 --> 01:02:08.058 region:rollup2
PHYSICALLY MENTALLY UNDERWRITING

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:09.092 region:rollup2
A LOT OF TIMES ARE PULLING IN

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:10.160 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTS FROM THE CUSTOMER

01:02:09.092 --> 01:02:11.595 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE WE CAN SEE THEIR

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.929 region:rollup2
BANK STATEMENT READ IT. OUR

01:02:11.595 --> 01:02:13.863 region:rollup2
ONLINE LENDERS DO THAT AT THE

01:02:12.929 --> 01:02:15.599 region:rollup2
SAME TIME BUT A LOT OF US THAT

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:17.601 region:rollup2
HAVE STORE FRONTS WE SEE THAT

01:02:15.599 --> 01:02:18.935 region:rollup2
CUSTOMER EVERY MONTH WHEN THEY

01:02:17.601 --> 01:02:20.103 region:rollup2
COME IN TO MAKE THE PAYMENT.

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:21.738 region:rollup2
MEAN MOST BANKS DON'T EVER SEE

01:02:20.103 --> 01:02:23.006 region:rollup2
THE CUSS WORDS AGAIN ON ON ON AN

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:24.641 region:rollup2
AUTO LOAN OR HOME LOAN.

01:02:23.006 --> 01:02:26.276 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE HIGH TOUCH SO THAT

01:02:24.641 --> 01:02:28.144 region:rollup2
PRODUCES THERE'S LABOR COSTS THE

01:02:26.276 --> 01:02:31.147 region:rollup2
RISING OCCUPANCY COST TO HAVE

01:02:28.144 --> 01:02:31.881 region:rollup2
STORE FRONTS SO IT AND THESE ARE

01:02:31.147 --> 01:02:33.283 region:rollup2
HIGHER RISK CUSTOMER BASE.

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:34.451 region:rollup2
SO THEIR CUSTOMERS THAT

01:02:33.283 --> 01:02:35.819 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY BOMB WERE NOT

01:02:34.451 --> 01:02:37.320 region:rollup2
APPROVING SO WE HAVE TO ALSO

01:02:35.819 --> 01:02:39.256 region:rollup2
UNDERWRITE WAS APPLICATIONS AND

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.789 region:rollup2
WE TURN THOSE ARE TURNED DOWN

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:41.324 region:rollup2
UNDER THE PILOT PROGRAM I

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:42.626 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT THE. THE APPROVAL

01:02:41.324 --> 01:02:43.960 region:rollup2
RATES ABOUT THIRTY FIVE PERCENT

01:02:42.626 --> 01:02:45.629 region:rollup2
FOR CUSTOMERS THAT WALK INTO A

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:47.831 region:rollup2
STORE FRONT.

01:02:45.629 --> 01:02:49.666 region:rollup2
SO. THEY ARE THAT THOSE ARE THE

01:02:47.831 --> 01:02:50.667 region:rollup2
NUMBERS THAT SHOWS WHY THIS IS A

01:02:49.666 --> 01:02:52.068 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT MORE OF AN EXPENSIVE

01:02:50.667 --> 01:02:53.770 region:rollup2
LOAN. OF THEN LET'S SEE MORE

01:02:52.068 --> 01:02:56.706 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL CREDIT CARDS OR

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:58.308 region:rollup2
FRAUDULENT SO NO DOUBT AND AND

01:02:56.706 --> 01:03:00.043 region:rollup2
AND AND I DON'T MEAN TO A.

01:02:58.308 --> 01:03:01.978 region:rollup2
UNDER MINOR OR QUESTION YOUR

01:03:00.043 --> 01:03:03.513 region:rollup2
INTEGRITY NO DOUBT THERE ARE

01:03:01.978 --> 01:03:04.848 region:rollup2
GOOD PLAYERS.

01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:06.316 region:rollup2
THAT ARE LOANING IN THE SPACE OF

01:03:04.848 --> 01:03:08.184 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TO FIVE

01:03:06.316 --> 01:03:10.920 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EVEN TEN THOUSAND I GET

01:03:08.184 --> 01:03:13.156 region:rollup2
THAT. AND THEY ARE JUSTIFYING

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:14.124 region:rollup2
THEY ARE USING DATA TO TRY TO TO

01:03:13.156 --> 01:03:15.859 region:rollup2
DO WITH A GOOD BUSINESS MODEL.

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:17.327 region:rollup2
HOW?

01:03:15.859 --> 01:03:20.296 region:rollup2
BUT HOW MUCH WE'RE TO WHAT

01:03:17.327 --> 01:03:22.799 region:rollup2
DEGREE IS THERE UNDERWRITING A

01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:23.867 region:rollup2
IS UNDERWRITING TAKING PLACE IN

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:25.702 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS OF YOU GIVING UP

01:03:23.867 --> 01:03:26.336 region:rollup2
THOUGH BELONGS.

01:03:25.702 --> 01:03:27.504 region:rollup2
WELL I'D LIKE TO SAY IS REQUIRED

01:03:26.336 --> 01:03:29.005 region:rollup2
BY LAW.

01:03:27.504 --> 01:03:30.206 region:rollup2
NONE OF US CAN DO ALONE HEARING

01:03:29.005 --> 01:03:32.542 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WITHOUT DOING

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:33.543 region:rollup2
UNDERWRITING. OF IN FACT IF YOU

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:35.545 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE CALIFORNIA CODE OF

01:03:33.543 --> 01:03:37.747 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS THAT BELIEVE IT'S

01:03:35.545 --> 01:03:39.949 region:rollup2
CODE SECTION OF FOURTEEN SIXTY

01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:41.451 region:rollup2
TWO. THAT REQUIRES MEANINGFUL

01:03:39.949 --> 01:03:42.619 region:rollup2
UNDERWRITING THE DEPARTMENT HAS

01:03:41.451 --> 01:03:44.587 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO COME IN AND AUDIT

01:03:42.619 --> 01:03:45.689 region:rollup2
EACH LENDER. BOMB IS AUDITED BY

01:03:44.587 --> 01:03:46.823 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS

01:03:45.689 --> 01:03:48.958 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT AND THERE'S REQUIRE

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:50.994 region:rollup2
UNDER EXISTING LAW THAT WE HAVE

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:52.729 region:rollup2
TO UNDERWRITE. SO I MEET OUR OUR

01:03:50.994 --> 01:03:54.531 region:rollup2
OPINION IS THAT INSTEAD OF

01:03:52.729 --> 01:03:56.199 region:rollup2
IMPOSING BECOME A BARRIER TO

01:03:54.531 --> 01:03:56.566 region:rollup2
ENTRY TO CREDIT WITH THE RATE

01:03:56.199 --> 01:03:57.634 region:rollup2
CAP.

01:03:56.566 --> 01:03:59.502 region:rollup2
IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE MAY BE

01:03:57.634 --> 01:04:01.104 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORS OR SPECIFIC THINGS WE

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:02.238 region:rollup2
WANT TO DO ABOUT UNDERWRITING I

01:04:01.104 --> 01:04:03.973 region:rollup2
KNOW OUR INDUSTRIES OPEN TO

01:04:02.238 --> 01:04:06.176 region:rollup2
THOSE DISCUSSIONS AS OPPOSED TO

01:04:03.973 --> 01:04:07.444 region:rollup2
MAYBE TAKING A CHAINSAW. TO THIS

NOT A STRONG MUTUAL INTEREST.

01:07:00.216 --> 01:07:03.286 region:rollup2
BETWEEN LENDERS AND BORROWERS BY

CHARGING HIGH INTEREST RATES

01:07:03.286 --> 01:07:06.155 region:rollup2
LETTERS CAN GENERATE ENOUGH

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:08.291 region:rollup2

THE COSTS ASSOCIATED

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:16.099 region:rollup2
UNDERWRITING WHICH RESULTS IN

CANNOT AFFORD. DATA FROM THE DDO

01:07:19.736 --> 01:07:22.872 region:rollup2
SO THAT SOME OF THE LARGEST CFL

01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:41.190 region:rollup2
THERE'S A REASON WHY THEY'RE

ABLE TO.

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:42.358 region:rollup2

OTHERWISE WOULDN'T BE APPROVED

01:07:42.358 --> 01:07:43.426 region:rollup2
IS BECAUSE THEY CAN MAKE A

01:07:42.926 --> 01:07:45.929 region:rollup2
PROFIT OFF ENOUGH ALONE

01:07:43.426 --> 01:07:47.897 region:rollup2

BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE THAT PART

01:07:54.771 --> 01:07:56.839 region:rollup2
OF IT.

01:07:55.471 --> 01:07:58.374 region:rollup2

BUT. ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT.

01:09:55.324 --> 01:09:59.695 region:rollup2

NINETY DOLLARS TAKES MY THAT WAS

01:10:52.315 --> 01:10:56.285 region:rollup2
LESS THAN NINETY DOLLARS AN

01:10:53.816 --> 01:10:57.253 region:rollup2
INCREASE FROM THE SEVENTY FIVE.

01:10:56.285 --> 01:10:59.355 region:rollup2

THESE HIGHER DOLLAR LOANS OVER

01:11:05.895 --> 01:11:07.697 region:rollup2
THEIR HEADS UP TO NINETY DEGREE

01:11:06.562 --> 01:11:09.866 region:rollup2
SO THAT I DOLLARS POINT OF

01:11:07.697 --> 01:11:12.034 region:rollup2
CONTENTION DATA ANYWAY I'M NOT

01:11:09.866 --> 01:11:13.169 region:rollup2
REALLY UP ON HERE BUT I'M NOT

01:11:12.034 --> 01:11:14.937 region:rollup2

01:11:13.169 --> 01:11:17.673 region:rollup2
OKAY SORRY ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:18.374 region:rollup2
GRAYSON YES AND THEN.

01:11:17.673 --> 01:11:18.708 region:rollup2
.

01:11:18.374 --> 01:11:21.210 region:rollup2
DO YOU BLOOM.

01:11:18.708 --> 01:11:23.079 region:rollup2
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT. IF THERE

01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:24.981 region:rollup2
IS A CORPORATION OR A COMPANY

01:11:23.079 --> 01:11:27.150 region:rollup2
THAT IS MAKING LOANS AND THOSE

01:11:24.981 --> 01:11:28.050 region:rollup2
LOANS ARE VERY HIGH RISK AND I

01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:28.885 region:rollup2
THINK EVERYONE HERE WOULD AGREE

01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:30.653 region:rollup2
THOSE LAWS ARE VERY HIGH RISK.

01:11:28.885 --> 01:11:32.588 region:rollup2
THEN THAT.

01:11:30.653 --> 01:11:34.457 region:rollup2
THAT CORPORATION COMPANY SHOULD

01:11:32.588 --> 01:11:35.091 region:rollup2
BE GIVEN THE OPTION.

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:36.492 region:rollup2
OF.

01:11:35.091 --> 01:11:39.195 region:rollup2
OFFERING VOLUNTARY.

01:11:36.492 --> 01:11:40.396 region:rollup2
LOAN INSURANCE.

01:11:39.195 --> 01:11:41.831 region:rollup2
I THINK AND WHAT THE COUPLE

01:11:40.396 --> 01:11:43.633 region:rollup2
THINGS ONE IS THAT IF.

01:11:41.831 --> 01:11:45.368 region:rollup2
COMPANIES ARE OFFERING.

01:11:43.633 --> 01:11:47.303 region:rollup2
HIGH RISK LOANS.

01:11:45.368 --> 01:11:48.838 region:rollup2
AND THEIR INTERESTS

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:50.072 region:rollup2
ARE ALIGNED WITH THE CUSTOMER IN

01:11:48.838 --> 01:11:51.507 region:rollup2
THAT THEY ACTUALLY.

01:11:50.072 --> 01:11:53.442 region:rollup2
DESIRE THE CUSTOMERS ARE TO PAY

01:11:51.507 --> 01:11:54.877 region:rollup2
OFF THE LOAN. THEN I THINK THAT

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:56.412 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WOULD BE A WORLD THAT

01:11:54.877 --> 01:11:58.948 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT CURRENTLY IN.

01:11:56.412 --> 01:11:59.615 region:rollup2
IF YOUR TALKING ABOUT IT AND

01:11:58.948 --> 01:12:01.017 region:rollup2
AND ALTHOUGH I BUT I'M GLAD YOU

01:11:59.615 --> 01:12:02.485 region:rollup2
RAISED INSURANCE POINT THIS IS

01:12:01.017 --> 01:12:04.187 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT I COMMIT

01:12:02.485 --> 01:12:06.122 region:rollup2
CONTINUOUS TALK ABOUT INSURANCE

01:12:04.187 --> 01:12:07.924 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK I'VE READ ABOUT

01:12:06.122 --> 01:12:08.858 region:rollup2
THIS GUY THAT THIS HOUSE THE

01:12:07.924 --> 01:12:10.560 region:rollup2
COMPANY VIEW THAT. MIGHT.

01:12:08.858 --> 01:12:11.427 region:rollup2
IMPRESSION OF INSURANCE WAS VERY

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.328 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT IN THIS WHOLE JOURNEY

01:12:11.427 --> 01:12:14.864 region:rollup2
STARTED.

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:17.233 region:rollup2
AND I'LL BE TALK TO SOME.

01:12:14.864 --> 01:12:18.434 region:rollup2
.

01:12:17.233 --> 01:12:19.368 region:rollup2
THE BILL TAUGHT LIVE WORK GOING

01:12:18.434 --> 01:12:20.903 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE TO TALK TO FOLKS

01:12:19.368 --> 01:12:21.804 region:rollup2
THAT YOU OFFER INSURANCE THAT

01:12:20.903 --> 01:12:23.706 region:rollup2
INDICATED THERE INSURANCE

01:12:21.804 --> 01:12:25.174 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES IN THE ONE TO ELEVEN

01:12:23.706 --> 01:12:26.142 region:rollup2

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:27.977 region:rollup2
HUNDRED TWO DOLLARS A MONTH

01:12:26.142 --> 01:12:29.512 region:rollup2
RANGE. OPERATE WE'RE COMMITTED

01:12:27.977 --> 01:12:30.913 region:rollup2
TO KEEN TO TALK TO THEM THIS

01:12:29.512 --> 01:12:33.082 region:rollup2
BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT CREDIT

01:12:30.913 --> 01:12:34.150 region:rollup2
INSURANCE AND ANYWAY. SO DOES

01:12:33.082 --> 01:12:35.685 region:rollup2
ALLOW FOR IT.

01:12:34.150 --> 01:12:37.086 region:rollup2
BUT IF THERE IS SOME KIND OF

01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:39.522 region:rollup2
BUSINESS MODEL THAT A COMPANY

01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:41.991 region:rollup2
HAS WHERE. THE CUT INSURANCE IS

01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:43.459 region:rollup2
NOT EGREGIOUS AND AS PART OF HOW

01:12:41.991 --> 01:12:45.061 region:rollup2
THEY OPERATE AND PROTECT

01:12:43.459 --> 01:12:47.063 region:rollup2

PARAMETER OF THE CAP.

01:12:56.472 --> 01:12:59.342 region:rollup2

01:14:21.557 --> 01:14:24.894 region:rollup2
.

01:14:23.626 --> 01:14:26.762 region:rollup2

01:14:38.007 --> 01:14:41.944 region:rollup2
CREDIT SCORE WOULD THEY BE

01:14:39.542 --> 01:14:43.412 region:rollup2
DIRECTED TO A MORE REASONABLE.

CHARGING. FOLKS.

01:14:49.518 --> 01:14:54.357 region:rollup2

FOR TRADITIONAL MONTHS RIGHT.

01:15:08.471 --> 01:15:11.974 region:rollup2
SO CUSTOMERS TYPICALLY COME

01:15:10.272 --> 01:15:14.176 region:rollup2
INTO OUR STORE THEY FILL OUT AN

01:15:11.974 --> 01:15:16.345 region:rollup2
APPLICATION WE ASK THEM.

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:17.380 region:rollup2
FOR SOME BASIC INFORMATION AND

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:18.848 region:rollup2
THEN WE LET THEM KNOW WHAT

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:20.149 region:rollup2

WHO COME MEN RIGHT WHO I.

01:15:37.733 --> 01:15:40.970 region:rollup2
PROBABLY COULD.

01:15:39.502 --> 01:15:43.339 region:rollup2
DO MUCH BETTER IN THE MARKET IF

01:15:55.317 --> 01:15:57.987 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN TURNED DOWN BY

01:15:56.352 --> 01:15:59.021 region:rollup2
THEIR BANK OR CREDIT UNION THEY

01:15:57.987 --> 01:16:01.257 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THAT THEY DON'T

01:15:59.021 --> 01:16:02.391 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT QUALIFYING FOR. THE

01:16:01.257 --> 01:16:04.593 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THIRTY SIX PERCENT ARE

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:05.494 region:rollup2
UNDER UNDER LOAN IN FACT I KNOW

01:16:04.593 --> 01:16:06.462 region:rollup2
THAT SEVERAL LETTERS HAVE

01:16:05.494 --> 01:16:07.830 region:rollup2
REPORTED THAT WHEN THEY RUN

01:16:06.462 --> 01:16:09.465 region:rollup2
CREDIT AS PART OF THE

01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:11.033 region:rollup2
UNDERWRITING. THEY SEE THE

01:16:09.465 --> 01:16:12.835 region:rollup2
INCREASE FROM THE TRADITIONAL

01:16:11.033 --> 01:16:14.804 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL SORT THERE'S NO DOUBT

01:16:12.835 --> 01:16:16.138 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE JUST TALKING. NIGHT IF

01:16:14.804 --> 01:16:18.207 region:rollup2
THAT RIGHT BUT IF IF YOU KNOW IF

01:16:16.138 --> 01:16:19.241 region:rollup2
MY DAUGHTER WALKED INTO THE

01:16:18.207 --> 01:16:20.142 region:rollup2
CORNER STORE.

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:22.144 region:rollup2

01:16:20.142 --> 01:16:23.045 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY HIGH CREDIT SCORE FOR

01:16:22.144 --> 01:16:25.648 region:rollup2
A TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD?

?

01:16:25.648 --> 01:16:29.618 region:rollup2
STOP IT THERE WOULD BE NO.

01:16:27.616 --> 01:16:31.353 region:rollup2
SUGGESTION THAT SHE MIGHT BE

01:16:29.618 --> 01:16:32.788 region:rollup2
BETTER SERVED WITH A LOAN UNDER

01:16:31.353 --> 01:16:34.056 region:rollup2
THE PILOT OR BY GOING TO A

01:16:32.788 --> 01:16:35.825 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL BANK BECAUSE SHE HAS

01:16:34.056 --> 01:16:37.460 region:rollup2
BEEN UNBANKED.

01:16:35.825 --> 01:16:39.161 region:rollup2
SO SPECIFIC ALL TALK ABOUT MY

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:40.763 region:rollup2
STORES I OFFER I'M A FIGHTER FOR

01:16:39.161 --> 01:16:42.198 region:rollup2

SO THEY CAN WALK IN AND THEY CAN

01:16:42.198 --> 01:16:45.634 region:rollup2
DO IT HAD A LONG. THEY COULD DO

01:16:45.067 --> 01:16:47.670 region:rollup2
A PILOT PROGRAM ONE OF THE

01:16:45.634 --> 01:16:48.737 region:rollup2

QUALIFY.

01:16:52.274 --> 01:16:55.578 region:rollup2
SO IN THAT SITUATION THAT PERSON

01:16:54.343 --> 01:16:57.346 region:rollup2
DOES QUALIFY FOR PILOT PROGRAM

01:16:55.578 --> 01:16:58.581 region:rollup2

OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO YOU. BUT

01:17:39.855 --> 01:17:42.124 region:rollup2

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:43.692 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO

01:17:42.124 --> 01:17:44.927 region:rollup2

01:17:43.692 --> 01:17:46.395 region:rollup2
MORE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT

01:17:44.927 --> 01:17:48.531 region:rollup2

IMPOSING A RATE CAP BECAUSE THAT

01:17:49.398 --> 01:17:52.601 region:rollup2

JUST TURNING AWAY.

01:17:58.274 --> 01:18:01.544 region:rollup2
I'M I'M JUST CONCERNED BECAUSE I

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:03.646 region:rollup2
I FEEL LIKE WHEN I ASK THESE

01:18:01.544 --> 01:18:05.181 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS I DON'T GET REALLY

01:18:03.646 --> 01:18:07.449 region:rollup2

HAPPEN IN MY STORE OR THAT.

01:18:07.449 --> 01:18:10.386 region:rollup2
PEOPLE DON'T REALLY COME IN WITH

GOOD CREDIT OR THEY TRIED OTHER

01:18:10.386 --> 01:18:14.723 region:rollup2
THINGS IN. AND I'M I HAVE A

01:18:12.855 --> 01:18:15.958 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE COMMUNITY A CHALLENGE

01:18:14.723 --> 01:18:17.860 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE

01:18:15.958 --> 01:18:19.295 region:rollup2
UNBANKED OR HAVE NEVER HAD A

01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:20.696 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL LOAN OR DON'T KNOW

WHERE THEY GO. AND YOU CAN'T GO

01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:24.967 region:rollup2

EXIST.

01:18:24.967 --> 01:18:29.605 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND SO WHEN EVERY OTHER

01:18:27.636 --> 01:18:30.206 region:rollup2
BLOCK IS SOME SORT OF PRODUCT

01:18:29.605 --> 01:18:32.708 region:rollup2

POVERTY.

01:18:36.011 --> 01:18:38.647 region:rollup2
CERNAN OBVIOUSLY SO I'M JUST

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.082 region:rollup2
KIND OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:18:38.647 --> 01:18:42.418 region:rollup2
WHY.

01:18:40.082 --> 01:18:43.719 region:rollup2
OR OR WHITE WE DON'T HAVE HER

01:18:42.418 --> 01:18:44.286 region:rollup2

01:18:44.286 --> 01:18:46.822 region:rollup2
LITTLE.

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:49.525 region:rollup2
DISCOURAGE THAT THIS INDUSTRY

01:18:46.822 --> 01:18:51.293 region:rollup2
THAT SO HIGHLY REGULATED AND.

01:18:49.525 --> 01:18:53.395 region:rollup2

HAS NO HARD DATA ON WHAT'S

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:56.031 region:rollup2
REALLY HAPPENING OR MAYBE THERE

01:18:54.663 --> 01:18:58.500 region:rollup2
IS DATA THAT WE JUST DON'T HAVE

01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:59.935 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO TO TELL US. YOU KNOW

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:02.171 region:rollup2
THIS MANY PEOPLE COME IN WITH

01:18:59.935 --> 01:19:03.806 region:rollup2
THIS CREDIT SCORE THAT THESE ARE

01:19:02.171 --> 01:19:05.808 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE WHO TAKE CARE OF AYE

01:19:03.806 --> 01:19:07.476 region:rollup2
I'M CONCERNED THAT A LOT OF. I'M

01:19:05.808 --> 01:19:08.611 region:rollup2
GOOD HARD WORKING FOLKS TO HAVE

01:19:07.476 --> 01:19:10.346 region:rollup2
DECENT CREDIT SCORES IN MY

01:19:08.611 --> 01:19:12.214 region:rollup2

01:19:10.346 --> 01:19:12.815 region:rollup2
RATES FOR PEOPLE WHO REALLY

THE FIRST PLACE.

01:19:13.215 --> 01:19:17.553 region:rollup2
.

01:19:14.883 --> 01:19:19.355 region:rollup2
AND SO OBSCENITIES RIGHT THIRTY

01:19:17.553 --> 01:19:19.955 region:rollup2
PERCENT MIGHT BE DEFAULTING BUT

01:19:19.355 --> 01:19:22.458 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS SEVENTY PERCENT ARE

01:19:19.955 --> 01:19:23.225 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:19:22.458 --> 01:19:24.426 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE STILL PAYING THOSE

01:19:23.225 --> 01:19:25.961 region:rollup2
RATES IN THEIR PAIN FOR A VERY

01:19:24.426 --> 01:19:26.729 region:rollup2
LONG TIME SO I'M JUST I'M I'M

01:19:25.961 --> 01:19:28.097 region:rollup2
TRYING TO GET AS MUCH

01:19:26.729 --> 01:19:29.665 region:rollup2
INFORMATION IT'S BEEN EXTREMELY

01:19:28.097 --> 01:19:30.966 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATING FOR ME. AND I GET

01:19:29.665 --> 01:19:33.235 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION

WE CAN ASK SOMEONE AND AT THIS

01:21:16.739 --> 01:21:20.109 region:rollup2
MOMENT TIME I THINK THE QUESTION

WAS YET THROUGHOUT IT TYPICALLY

01:21:20.109 --> 01:21:24.613 region:rollup2

SO YEAH BUT WAIT I'M NOW I'M

01:21:26.782 --> 01:21:28.951 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT DAD ON THE OTHER SIDE

01:21:27.483 --> 01:21:30.185 region:rollup2
IN THE STATES WHERE THERE HAVE

01:21:28.951 --> 01:21:32.354 region:rollup2
BEEN CAPPED HOW DO WE KNOW THAT.

01:21:30.185 --> 01:21:33.655 region:rollup2
.

01:21:32.354 --> 01:21:35.958 region:rollup2
SOME PEOPLE AREN'T JUST.

01:21:33.655 --> 01:21:37.326 region:rollup2
GOING UNDERGROUND BASICALLY TO

01:21:35.958 --> 01:21:39.328 region:rollup2
TRY TO GET ENOUGH MONEY TO

01:21:37.326 --> 01:21:41.497 region:rollup2
FULFILL WHAT OUR BASIC NEEDS AND

01:21:39.328 --> 01:21:43.265 region:rollup2
SOCIETY SURE AND AND THAT'S

01:21:41.497 --> 01:21:44.400 region:rollup2
THAT'S A WONDERFUL POINT BECAUSE

01:21:43.265 --> 01:21:45.434 region:rollup2
FOR YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE WORKED.

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.668 region:rollup2

01:21:46.668 --> 01:21:50.439 region:rollup2
LATINOS HAVE A ZERO CREDIT SCORE

01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:52.107 region:rollup2
OR NO CREDIT SCORE. AND THAT'S

01:21:50.439 --> 01:21:53.275 region:rollup2
NOT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:54.610 region:rollup2
TO MANAGE THEIR MONEY IT'S

01:21:53.275 --> 01:21:56.278 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE PAYING CASH.

01:21:54.610 --> 01:21:57.546 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS THIS IS THE ISSUE WE

01:21:56.278 --> 01:21:58.781 region:rollup2
HAVE IS THAT THE STORES ARE IN

01:21:57.546 --> 01:22:00.549 region:rollup2

EAST MONTANA PAYDAY LENDING

01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:07.069 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S TOO HIGH BUT

01:25:05.701 --> 01:25:08.136 region:rollup2
WHAT IS IS OUR CAP WELL HERE

01:25:07.069 --> 01:25:09.371 region:rollup2
HERE'S EXECUTIVE THERE'S A CAP

01:25:08.136 --> 01:25:11.340 region:rollup2
IN THEIR SOME GOOD DATA TO KNOW

01:25:09.371 --> 01:25:13.408 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS IF PEOPLE CAN'T GET

01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:14.376 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY GO. AND I'M GONNA USE

01:25:13.408 --> 01:25:15.944 region:rollup2
THE EXAMPLE FROM THE NEW YORK

01:25:14.376 --> 01:25:16.878 region:rollup2
STATE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL

01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:18.847 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

01:25:16.878 --> 01:25:20.449 region:rollup2
WHO ORDERED THIRTY FIVE LENDERS

01:25:18.847 --> 01:25:22.584 region:rollup2
TO SEIZE LANDING IN STATE?

01:25:20.449 --> 01:25:23.151 region:rollup2
TO STATE RESIDENCES AND THIS IS

01:25:22.584 --> 01:25:24.653 region:rollup2
IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND

01:25:23.151 --> 01:25:25.754 region:rollup2

AS WELL. SO PEOPLE SO HERE'S THE

01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:30.559 region:rollup2
POINT.

01:25:29.157 --> 01:25:32.327 region:rollup2
IF LOANS GO AWAY THE DEMAND DOES

01:25:30.559 --> 01:25:34.096 region:rollup2
NOT GO AWAY. THERE'S A SMALL

01:25:32.327 --> 01:25:36.031 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE THAT MAY FIND OTHER

01:25:34.096 --> 01:25:38.266 region:rollup2
OTHER IN STATE OPTIONS BUT THE

01:25:36.031 --> 01:25:39.835 region:rollup2
VAST MAJORITY. YOU HAVE LENDERS

01:25:38.266 --> 01:25:41.136 region:rollup2
COMING IN FROM OUT OF STATE.

01:25:39.835 --> 01:25:42.604 region:rollup2
THESE LENDERS ARE NOT LICENSED

01:25:41.136 --> 01:25:43.772 region:rollup2
BY THE STATE AND ARE NOT

01:25:42.604 --> 01:25:45.741 region:rollup2
REGULATED BY THE STATE THE

01:25:43.772 --> 01:25:47.175 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS CAN GET THE LOANS

01:25:45.741 --> 01:25:48.510 region:rollup2
THEY'RE JUST NOT. UNDER THE

01:25:47.175 --> 01:25:50.078 region:rollup2
SUPERVISION OF STATE AUDITORS

01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:51.513 region:rollup2
AND REGULATORS WHAT IS A CAP AT

01:25:50.078 --> 01:25:53.482 region:rollup2
NEW YORK'S I'M SORRY I BELIEVE

01:25:51.513 --> 01:25:54.249 region:rollup2
IT'S THIRTY SIX PERCENT BUT I I

01:25:53.482 --> 01:25:55.250 region:rollup2
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE BUT IT

01:25:54.249 --> 01:25:56.885 region:rollup2
LEAVES THIRTY SIX ALL I KNOW IS

01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:58.754 region:rollup2
THAT ART FROM OUR INDUSTRY DOES

01:25:56.885 --> 01:26:01.356 region:rollup2
NOT LEND IN CITY AND. IN THE

01:25:58.754 --> 01:26:02.057 region:rollup2
STATE OF NEW YORK BUT WE DO KNOW

01:26:01.356 --> 01:26:03.759 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE UNLICENSED.

01:26:02.057 --> 01:26:05.060 region:rollup2
NON STATE REGULATED LENDERS WHO

01:26:03.759 --> 01:26:06.495 region:rollup2
ARE LANDING IN THE STATE OF NEW

01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:07.229 region:rollup2
YORK NOT YOU KNOW THAT BASED ON

01:26:06.495 --> 01:26:08.830 region:rollup2
THAT IS THAT HAPPENING

01:26:07.229 --> 01:26:09.931 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. WELL YES WE DO WE

01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:10.932 region:rollup2
HAVE TO KNOW THAT WILL RIGHT NOW

01:26:09.931 --> 01:26:12.200 region:rollup2
AND THE NICE THING HERE IN

01:26:10.932 --> 01:26:13.702 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS THAT WE DO HAVE A

01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:14.636 region:rollup2
RIGHT WE DO HAVE REGULATED

01:26:13.702 --> 01:26:16.171 region:rollup2
LENDERS.

01:26:14.636 --> 01:26:17.372 region:rollup2
LENDERS ARE REGULATED WE CAN

01:26:16.171 --> 01:26:18.907 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THE INTEREST RATE WE

01:26:17.372 --> 01:26:22.010 region:rollup2
STILL HAVE AND WE HAVE A HELL

01:26:18.907 --> 01:26:23.345 region:rollup2
AND LICENSED.

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:25.013 region:rollup2
LENDERS FROM OUT OF STATE DELPHI

01:26:23.345 --> 01:26:26.214 region:rollup2
SO IT HERE'S A PROXY WE CAN TALK

01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:28.316 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW DO WE GET TO THAT

01:26:26.214 --> 01:26:30.018 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT FOUND IN THE

01:26:28.316 --> 01:26:30.786 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS AND REPORTING THAT'S

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:31.720 region:rollup2
WHY WE'RE SAYING WE NEED MORE

01:26:30.786 --> 01:26:33.655 region:rollup2
DATA BEFORE WE MAKE SUCH A

01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:35.123 region:rollup2
SERIOUS. DECISION TO IMPOSE A

01:26:33.655 --> 01:26:35.624 region:rollup2
RATE CAP IN AND AND THAT'S YOU

01:26:35.123 --> 01:26:36.691 region:rollup2
KNOW FROM THE STORIES WE

01:26:35.624 --> 01:26:37.693 region:rollup2
MENTION%

01:26:36.691 --> 01:26:38.627 region:rollup2
IN STATES THAT HAVE DONE THAT

01:26:37.693 --> 01:26:40.328 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS.

01:26:38.627 --> 01:26:42.097 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S WHERE WE CAN GET

01:26:40.328 --> 01:26:43.398 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL DATA ON THIS AND THAT

01:26:42.097 --> 01:26:44.966 region:rollup2
MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING I KNOW

01:26:43.398 --> 01:26:46.268 region:rollup2
ONE PAYDAY THE. YEARS AGO THE

01:26:44.966 --> 01:26:46.868 region:rollup2
PART WAS ASKED TO STUDY WE

01:26:46.268 --> 01:26:48.937 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T DONE THAT UNDER CFL.

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:50.439 region:rollup2
CAN.

01:26:48.937 --> 01:26:52.441 region:rollup2
CAN I JUST AB ONE LAST THING TO

01:26:50.439 --> 01:26:53.809 region:rollup2
IT SO BICU DID DO A REPORT IN

01:26:52.441 --> 01:26:55.177 region:rollup2
IN STATES THAT.

01:26:53.809 --> 01:26:56.611 region:rollup2
THAT DON'T HAVE THAT DO HAVE

01:26:55.177 --> 01:26:57.379 region:rollup2
RATE CAPS AND THERE IS AN

01:26:56.611 --> 01:26:59.014 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT THAT THEY MOVE TO

01:26:57.379 --> 01:27:00.248 region:rollup2
UNREGULATED UNLICENSED LENDERS

01:26:59.014 --> 01:27:01.349 region:rollup2
AND PEW FOUND THAT THAT WAS

01:27:00.248 --> 01:27:02.851 region:rollup2
UNTRUE.

01:27:01.349 --> 01:27:04.219 region:rollup2
AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA TWO

01:27:02.851 --> 01:27:05.620 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO THERE WAS A SUPREME

01:27:04.219 --> 01:27:07.589 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT RULING

01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:10.058 region:rollup2
AGAINST US THAT. ARE THERE ARE

01:27:07.589 --> 01:27:12.727 region:rollup2
TRIBAL LENDERS WHO CAN DON'T.

01:27:10.058 --> 01:27:14.362 region:rollup2
HAVE TO FOLLOW THE RECAP BUT

01:27:12.727 --> 01:27:15.931 region:rollup2
THE SUPREME COURT RULING MADE IT

01:27:14.362 --> 01:27:18.467 region:rollup2
SO THAT THE LENDERS HAVE TO

01:27:15.931 --> 01:27:19.468 region:rollup2
PROVE THEIR TRIBAL CONNECTIONS

01:27:18.467 --> 01:27:20.802 region:rollup2
AND MAKE SURE THAT.

01:27:19.468 --> 01:27:22.170 region:rollup2
PAYDAY LENDERS ARE NOT JUST YOU

01:27:20.802 --> 01:27:25.107 region:rollup2
KNOW ATTACHING THEMSELVES TO THE

01:27:22.170 --> 01:27:27.142 region:rollup2
TRIBAL COMMUNITIES ALL THAT.

01:27:25.107 --> 01:27:28.910 region:rollup2
WHICH WE HAVE TROUBLES ARE

01:27:27.142 --> 01:27:30.245 region:rollup2
LENDING INCOMPLETE PICKUP. ABOUT

01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:31.279 region:rollup2
YEAH I UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN I

01:27:30.245 --> 01:27:33.381 region:rollup2
THOUGHT ON AT LIKE SEVEN JANET

01:27:31.279 --> 01:27:34.015 region:rollup2
MAYBE I. WILL RESPOND TO THEM

01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:35.684 region:rollup2
YEAH LOST TOUCH AND THEN AND I

01:27:34.015 --> 01:27:36.818 region:rollup2
KNOW WE HAVE SEVERAL OTHER

01:27:35.684 --> 01:27:38.653 region:rollup2
MEMBERS KNOW THAT TICKET THAT'S

01:27:36.818 --> 01:27:40.055 region:rollup2
OKAY AND I THINK AT THE AUTHOR

01:27:38.653 --> 01:27:43.959 region:rollup2
HAS. A RESPONSE TO YOU WE HAVE

01:27:40.055 --> 01:27:44.593 region:rollup2
SEVERAL OTHER MEMBERS WELL AND

01:27:43.959 --> 01:27:45.861 region:rollup2
TO ADDITIONAL BILLS THAT WILL BE

01:27:44.593 --> 01:27:47.395 region:rollup2
HEARD

01:27:45.861 --> 01:27:49.097 region:rollup2
YES. SO THAT LOOKED AT ME THAT

01:27:47.395 --> 01:27:50.165 region:rollup2
THE ARGUMENT FOR ANY KIND OF

01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:51.967 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS THAT WILL THERE'S

01:27:50.165 --> 01:27:53.368 region:rollup2
COMING ON REGULAR MARTIN PEOPLE

01:27:51.967 --> 01:27:54.236 region:rollup2
GONNA BREAK THE LAW.

01:27:53.368 --> 01:27:55.036 region:rollup2
YES THAT COULD BE ARGUED THAT WE

01:27:54.236 --> 01:27:55.804 region:rollup2
MAY BUT THE REALITY THAT WHY IN

01:27:55.036 --> 01:27:57.105 region:rollup2
PLACES LIKE NEW YORK.

01:27:55.804 --> 01:27:58.273 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE THESE OTHER ENTITIES

01:27:57.105 --> 01:27:59.341 region:rollup2
THAT ARE STEPPING IN IS BECAUSE

01:27:58.273 --> 01:28:01.543 region:rollup2
THEY'VE NEVER HAD.

01:27:59.341 --> 01:28:03.612 region:rollup2
SCOURGE OF THESE.

01:28:01.543 --> 01:28:05.714 region:rollup2
ALL OF THESE HIGH INTEREST RATE.

01:28:03.612 --> 01:28:06.782 region:rollup2
BUT ENJOY LENDERS AND SO GREAT

01:28:05.714 --> 01:28:08.650 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WILL HAVE ON REGULAR

01:28:06.782 --> 01:28:09.818 region:rollup2
COME IN BUT THE REGULATED ONES

01:28:08.650 --> 01:28:11.419 region:rollup2
ARE ALREADY CHARGED THE SAME

01:28:09.818 --> 01:28:13.021 region:rollup2
WITH UNREGULATED WHO IS GOING TO

01:28:11.419 --> 01:28:13.822 region:rollup2
CHARGE THE LITERAL HOW WE REALLY

01:28:13.021 --> 01:28:15.690 region:rollup2
BENEFITING.

01:28:13.822 --> 01:28:16.892 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA

01:28:15.690 --> 01:28:18.860 region:rollup2
THE REALITY IS THAT CHANGE

01:28:16.892 --> 01:28:20.695 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT.

01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:22.063 region:rollup2
BOB RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW THAT

01:28:20.695 --> 01:28:24.566 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THERE ISN'T ECONOMIES OF

01:28:22.063 --> 01:28:26.434 region:rollup2
SCALE IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH WE

01:28:24.566 --> 01:28:28.003 region:rollup2
HAVE TO ADJUST OUR MARKET. THERE

01:28:26.434 --> 01:28:29.471 region:rollup2
TWICE MANY CFL LENDERS IN THE

01:28:28.003 --> 01:28:32.207 region:rollup2
ARE MCDONALD'S IN CALIFORNIA

01:28:29.471 --> 01:28:32.974 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY IS TALKING OVERNIGHT

01:28:32.207 --> 01:28:35.310 region:rollup2
AND SENATE INCUMBENT UPON US.

01:28:32.974 --> 01:28:37.479 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO

01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:39.781 region:rollup2
DO WE CAN'T PROTECT CONSUMERS UP

01:28:37.479 --> 01:28:41.082 region:rollup2
BUT THE REALITY IS THAT WHEN

01:28:39.781 --> 01:28:42.517 region:rollup2
EVEN IF THEY DON'T PEOPLE THAT A

01:28:41.082 --> 01:28:44.252 region:rollup2
LOT OF FOCUS ON DEFAULT. HERE

01:28:42.517 --> 01:28:45.687 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T DEFAULT WE HAVE TO GO

01:28:44.252 --> 01:28:47.455 region:rollup2
TO FRIENDS AND PAWN SHOPS NOT

01:28:45.687 --> 01:28:48.824 region:rollup2
JUST TO PAY BACK THE LOAN. BUT

01:28:47.455 --> 01:28:50.225 region:rollup2
THEN I'LL HAVE A THREE THOUSAND

01:28:48.824 --> 01:28:51.993 region:rollup2
ALONE THE CONDUCTING EIGHTEEN

01:28:50.225 --> 01:28:52.527 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:53.195 region:rollup2
DOLLARS FOR THE GET STRING

01:28:52.527 --> 01:28:55.697 region:rollup2
ALONG.

01:28:53.195 --> 01:28:58.066 region:rollup2
AND WE DO HAVE DATA THAT BIGGER

01:28:55.697 --> 01:28:58.633 region:rollup2
PUBLISHER THROUGH DPO DI BILL

01:28:58.066 --> 01:28:59.401 region:rollup2
AND THEN LET ME MAKE ANOTHER

01:28:58.633 --> 01:29:00.735 region:rollup2
POINT.

01:28:59.401 --> 01:29:01.736 region:rollup2
THE INDUSTRY CAN GIVE US DATA

01:29:00.735 --> 01:29:03.738 region:rollup2
ADVOCATES BATTER DATA THEY HAVE

01:29:01.736 --> 01:29:04.973 region:rollup2
THE NUMBERS.

01:29:03.738 --> 01:29:05.974 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS NOT

01:29:04.973 --> 01:29:07.475 region:rollup2
AMONG THE NUMBERS THAT THEY

01:29:05.974 --> 01:29:08.109 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO SEE.

01:29:07.475 --> 01:29:09.678 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE THE NUMBERS THAT WOULD

01:29:08.109 --> 01:29:11.046 region:rollup2
LIKE TO SEE.

01:29:09.678 --> 01:29:12.113 region:rollup2
LET'S MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR AS

01:29:11.046 --> 01:29:13.915 region:rollup2
WELL THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

01:29:12.113 --> 01:29:15.584 region:rollup2
DATA THE DATA DOES EXIST WE'RE

01:29:13.915 --> 01:29:17.018 region:rollup2
NOT PRIVY TO ALL OF IT. BUT WE

01:29:15.584 --> 01:29:18.486 region:rollup2
DO HAVE SOME DATA

01:29:17.018 --> 01:29:20.589 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THE DATA INDICATES

01:29:18.486 --> 01:29:22.257 region:rollup2
WE LOOK AT THE THE. LENDERS

01:29:20.589 --> 01:29:23.658 region:rollup2
THERE ARE.

01:29:22.257 --> 01:29:25.660 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A VAST MAJORITY

01:29:23.658 --> 01:29:27.229 region:rollup2
LENDERS THAT DO NOT.

01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:28.230 region:rollup2
DO NOT GIVE LOANS BELOW SEVEN

01:29:27.229 --> 01:29:30.065 region:rollup2
PERCENT WHEN I SEE SEVENTIES

01:29:28.230 --> 01:29:31.333 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SEVENTY NINE EYES MAYBE

01:29:30.065 --> 01:29:34.202 region:rollup2
THEY'LL GET BELOW NINETY I DON'T

01:29:31.333 --> 01:29:36.404 region:rollup2
KNOW BUT. THAT THERE OF. THE

01:29:34.202 --> 01:29:37.405 region:rollup2
IMPASSE OF NUMBER THAT VERY

01:29:36.404 --> 01:29:38.440 region:rollup2
RARELY GIVE BELOW.

01:29:37.405 --> 01:29:39.074 region:rollup2
AND SO SOME OF WHAT'S GOING DOOR

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:40.108 region:rollup2
AND COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR SIXTY

01:29:39.074 --> 01:29:42.644 region:rollup2
FIVE.

01:29:40.108 --> 01:29:43.778 region:rollup2
HT FIFTY.

01:29:42.644 --> 01:29:45.146 region:rollup2
THE LUCK OF THE THE OTHER TO

MAXIMIZE THEIR PROFITS

01:29:45.146 --> 01:29:47.082 region:rollup2

01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:48.350 region:rollup2
IS THAT THERE'S NOT ALL LINEMAN

01:29:47.082 --> 01:29:51.419 region:rollup2

ARE SOME THE FOLKS THAT ARE

01:30:04.866 --> 01:30:08.103 region:rollup2

01:35:24.886 --> 01:35:28.356 region:rollup2
BILLION. AT ROUGHLY THAT'S

01:35:27.322 --> 01:35:28.756 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLION SO HE

01:35:28.356 --> 01:35:31.192 region:rollup2
GETS.

01:35:28.756 --> 01:35:32.460 region:rollup2
I MEAN.

01:35:31.192 --> 01:35:33.895 region:rollup2
IT'S EASY TO SAIL WILL MAKE FIVE

01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:35.563 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:35:33.895 --> 01:35:37.665 region:rollup2
BUT THAT FIVE PERCENT REPRESENTS

01:35:35.563 --> 01:35:39.601 region:rollup2
A PRETTY LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY.

01:35:37.665 --> 01:35:41.235 region:rollup2
AND IN ON AND I THINK IT SOUNDS

01:35:39.601 --> 01:35:43.104 region:rollup2
SHOCKING.

01:35:41.235 --> 01:35:44.138 region:rollup2
FIRST WHEN YOU HEAR ALL THAT

01:35:43.104 --> 01:35:46.007 region:rollup2
SOUNDS LIKE A LOW MOUNTAIN. A

01:35:44.138 --> 01:35:48.576 region:rollup2
LOW DOLLAR AMOUNT.

01:35:46.007 --> 01:35:49.577 region:rollup2
ARE OR OR A LOW PERCENTAGE BUT

01:35:48.576 --> 01:35:51.012 region:rollup2
THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ACTUAL

01:35:49.577 --> 01:35:52.046 region:rollup2
DOLLAR AMOUNT.

01:35:51.012 --> 01:35:53.681 region:rollup2
I'M IN THAT IS THAT THAT IS A

01:35:52.046 --> 01:35:54.282 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:35:53.681 --> 01:35:56.117 region:rollup2
THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR ONE

01:35:54.282 --> 01:35:57.652 region:rollup2
COMPANY AROUND FIVE MILLION

01:35:56.117 --> 01:35:58.953 region:rollup2
DOLLARS FOR THE INDUSTRY WHEN IT

01:35:57.652 --> 01:36:00.421 region:rollup2
COMES TO THESE LANDS WITHIN A

01:35:58.953 --> 01:36:01.689 region:rollup2
GIVEN YEAR. AYE BECAUSE THIS TWO

01:36:00.421 --> 01:36:02.824 region:rollup2
POINT ONE BILLION YOU KNOW I

01:36:01.689 --> 01:36:04.192 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK YOU'LL FIND ANY

01:36:02.824 --> 01:36:05.760 region:rollup2
MEMBER ON THIS DIET THAT WILL

01:36:04.192 --> 01:36:07.895 region:rollup2
DISAGREE WITH A. WITH A

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:09.030 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES ABILITY OUGHT TO EARN

01:36:07.895 --> 01:36:10.798 region:rollup2
A PROFIT OFFER PROVIDING A

01:36:09.030 --> 01:36:11.833 region:rollup2
PRODUCT. I THINK WHAT WE'RE

01:36:10.798 --> 01:36:14.569 region:rollup2
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

01:36:11.833 --> 01:36:15.737 region:rollup2
WITH WHAT THIS PROCESS IS YOU

01:36:14.569 --> 01:36:16.638 region:rollup2
KNOW COMMON WAS MADE EARLIER

01:36:15.737 --> 01:36:18.606 region:rollup2
THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH

01:36:16.638 --> 01:36:19.040 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND WE NEED MORE

01:36:18.606 --> 01:36:20.375 region:rollup2
TIME THE MORE TIME.

01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:21.843 region:rollup2
.

01:36:20.375 --> 01:36:23.678 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IS AN ENGLISH THERE'S

01:36:21.843 --> 01:36:24.946 region:rollup2
AND IT ISN'T A NEW ISSUE ARE

01:36:23.678 --> 01:36:26.247 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN BROUGHT

01:36:24.946 --> 01:36:27.849 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW MANY TIMES.

01:36:26.247 --> 01:36:29.083 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR

01:36:27.849 --> 01:36:31.653 region:rollup2

LEADING MY CONSTITUENTS TO

01:37:05.119 --> 01:37:08.423 region:rollup2
INTO A POSITION WHERE THEY'RE

01:37:06.554 --> 01:37:10.191 region:rollup2
HAVING TO TURN TO ONLINE LENDERS

01:37:08.423 --> 01:37:11.492 region:rollup2
THAT ARE AND SECURED.

01:37:10.191 --> 01:37:12.827 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I THINK WE'RE LOOKING

01:37:11.492 --> 01:37:14.162 region:rollup2
AT.

01:37:12.827 --> 01:37:16.364 region:rollup2
ALL PREDATORY ASPECTS WHEN IT

01:37:14.162 --> 01:37:18.466 region:rollup2
COMES TO.

01:37:16.364 --> 01:37:19.667 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THIS INDUSTRY. HOT AND

01:37:18.466 --> 01:37:20.601 region:rollup2
NOT TO SAY THAT HAVING A

01:37:19.667 --> 01:37:21.769 region:rollup2
BUSINESS AND BEING A BUSINESS

01:37:20.601 --> 01:37:23.271 region:rollup2
OWNER MAKES YOUR PREDATOR BUT I

01:37:21.769 --> 01:37:24.672 region:rollup2
THINK.

01:37:23.271 --> 01:37:25.273 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE IS CONCERN AND

01:37:24.672 --> 01:37:26.774 region:rollup2
THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT STATE

01:37:25.273 --> 01:37:28.843 region:rollup2
INTEREST.

01:37:26.774 --> 01:37:30.645 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO WHEN YOU'RE THE

01:37:28.843 --> 01:37:32.280 region:rollup2
ONLY PLACE TO GO.

01:37:30.645 --> 01:37:34.048 region:rollup2
IS IT OKAY TO CHARGE WHATEVER

01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:35.316 region:rollup2
INTEREST IN RATE YOU WANT. IS IT

01:37:34.048 --> 01:37:36.918 region:rollup2
OKAY TO HAVE A HUNDRED THIRTY

01:37:35.316 --> 01:37:38.319 region:rollup2
TWO PERCENT INTEREST RATE

01:37:36.918 --> 01:37:39.620 region:rollup2
AND SO THE GETS IMPORTANT TO TO

01:37:38.319 --> 01:37:41.155 region:rollup2
TO UNDERSTAND QUE WILL HOW DOES

01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:42.790 region:rollup2
THAT FACTOR IN WHEN YOU TAKE A

01:37:41.155 --> 01:37:45.059 region:rollup2
LOOK AT. YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE

01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:46.627 region:rollup2
ARE YOU ARE YOU KNOW YOUR YOUR

01:37:45.059 --> 01:37:48.262 region:rollup2
YOUR FACILITY COSTS IN RENT.

01:37:46.627 --> 01:37:51.365 region:rollup2
AND YOU'RE AND AND YOU'RE AND

01:37:48.262 --> 01:37:52.967 region:rollup2
YEAH YOU NEED TO COST FOR LABOR.

01:37:51.365 --> 01:37:54.335 region:rollup2
TO PAY YOUR EMPLOYEES YOU KNOW

01:37:52.967 --> 01:37:56.270 region:rollup2
WHAT IS YOU KNOW THAT THE ENDING

01:37:54.335 --> 01:37:57.772 region:rollup2
AMOUNTS YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE

01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:59.941 region:rollup2
COMPANY MAKING IN THE AND IN.

01:37:57.772 --> 01:38:01.442 region:rollup2
AND AND I THINK THAT FOR US.

01:37:59.941 --> 01:38:03.077 region:rollup2
HERE

01:38:01.442 --> 01:38:04.345 region:rollup2
WHAT WE WANT IS TO CREATE A

01:38:03.077 --> 01:38:05.947 region:rollup2
MARKET THAT EXISTS THAT IS

01:38:04.345 --> 01:38:08.249 region:rollup2
REGULATED.

01:38:05.947 --> 01:38:10.151 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO IS FAIR AND EQUITABLE

01:38:08.249 --> 01:38:11.652 region:rollup2
SO THAT I HAVE CONFIDENCE

01:38:10.151 --> 01:38:13.221 region:rollup2
THERE WERE ALL OF THE STORES IN

01:38:11.652 --> 01:38:15.356 region:rollup2
ALL OF THESE DOORS THAT ARE IN

01:38:13.221 --> 01:38:16.991 region:rollup2
MY DISTRICT THATI DRIVE PAST

01:38:15.356 --> 01:38:18.693 region:rollup2
EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT I'M HOME.

01:38:16.991 --> 01:38:20.428 region:rollup2
THAT MY CONSTITUENTS ARE GOING

01:38:18.693 --> 01:38:21.562 region:rollup2
IN THERE NOT GETTING SCREWED.

01:38:20.428 --> 01:38:22.830 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW ANY

01:38:21.562 --> 01:38:24.265 region:rollup2
BETTER AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE

01:38:22.830 --> 01:38:26.100 region:rollup2
ELSE TO GO.

01:38:24.265 --> 01:38:27.401 region:rollup2
THIS ISN'T ABOUT HERE'S AN

01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:28.936 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY NEAR THE BOOGIE MAN AND

01:38:27.401 --> 01:38:31.172 region:rollup2
YOU'RE THE BAD GUY DOES NOT AT

01:38:28.936 --> 01:38:33.408 region:rollup2
ALL. MY FATHER HAS DONE A LOT OF

01:38:31.172 --> 01:38:35.510 region:rollup2
WORK HE'S TO SIT ON THIS DIET A

01:38:33.408 --> 01:38:36.811 region:rollup2
BE A MEMBER. OF THIS HOUSE A

01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:38.346 region:rollup2
BOTH HOUSES

01:38:36.811 --> 01:38:39.947 region:rollup2
WORKED A LOT ON THIS ISSUE AND

01:38:38.346 --> 01:38:41.849 region:rollup2
HE ALWAYS BELIEVED ARE IN THE

01:38:39.947 --> 01:38:42.984 region:rollup2
ABILITY FOR THOSE IN LOW INCOME

01:38:41.849 --> 01:38:44.285 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES TO HAVE ACCESS TO

01:38:42.984 --> 01:38:45.286 region:rollup2
CAPITAL WHEN THEY WOULDN'T HAVE

01:38:44.285 --> 01:38:46.621 region:rollup2
IT AN IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES WHEN

01:38:45.286 --> 01:38:47.755 region:rollup2
YOU. YOU KNOW YOU COULDN'T

01:38:46.621 --> 01:38:48.890 region:rollup2
BANKING AND YOU NEED THE MONEY

01:38:47.755 --> 01:38:50.558 region:rollup2
AND YOU COULDN'T FOR THINGS LIKE

01:38:48.890 --> 01:38:52.393 region:rollup2
PAYING FOR FUNERAL. AND I DON'T

01:38:50.558 --> 01:38:54.295 region:rollup2
WANT TO SEE THAT DISAPPEAR BUT I

01:38:52.393 --> 01:38:56.264 region:rollup2
ALSO I WOULD SAY THIS.

01:38:54.295 --> 01:38:57.532 region:rollup2
I'M ABOUT WHAT'S FAIR.

01:38:56.264 --> 01:38:58.800 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY DESERVES

01:38:57.532 --> 01:39:00.101 region:rollup2
ANYMORE OR ANY LESS THAN ANYBODY

01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:01.502 region:rollup2
ELSE.

01:39:00.101 --> 01:39:02.837 region:rollup2
I AND I THINK IF YOU HAVE THE

01:39:01.502 --> 01:39:04.205 region:rollup2
RIGHT AS A BUSINESS TURN MONEY

01:39:02.837 --> 01:39:05.740 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE FAIR

01:39:04.205 --> 01:39:06.941 region:rollup2
BASED ON WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.

01:39:05.740 --> 01:39:07.575 region:rollup2

I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW FROM THE

01:39:17.618 --> 01:39:22.623 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ARE BEING ASKED TODAY

01:39:19.387 --> 01:39:23.691 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY CLEAR? WHAT THAT

MOVE THROUGH THIS PROCESS.

01:39:34.001 --> 01:39:38.372 region:rollup2

REMOVING FIVE TO TEN THOUSAND

01:45:57.418 --> 01:46:00.287 region:rollup2

BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THAT THE

01:46:56.744 --> 01:47:01.048 region:rollup2
FARM MAJORITY OF THOSE THAT

01:46:58.979 --> 01:47:02.917 region:rollup2
AREN'T. OF THE FARM MAJORITY

01:47:01.048 --> 01:47:04.385 region:rollup2
LOANS GIVEN THAT AREN'T IN THE A

01:47:02.917 --> 01:47:06.820 region:rollup2
THIRTY SIX PERCENT RANGE THERE'S

01:47:04.385 --> 01:47:08.789 region:rollup2
A BIG GAP ALL OF A SUDDEN. IS I

01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:10.124 region:rollup2
DOUBT BECAUSE EVERYONE DOES GET

01:47:08.789 --> 01:47:11.492 region:rollup2
THIRTY SIX PERCENT ALL OF A

01:47:10.124 --> 01:47:12.760 region:rollup2
SUDDEN CAN'T QUALIFY THAT FIFTY

01:47:11.492 --> 01:47:14.528 region:rollup2
PERCENT OR SIXTY PERCENT OR

01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:16.196 region:rollup2
SEVENTY PERCENT. OR IS THERE A

01:47:14.528 --> 01:47:18.132 region:rollup2
BUSINESS MODEL IN PLACE THAT.

01:47:16.196 --> 01:47:20.034 region:rollup2
THAT IS.

01:47:18.132 --> 01:47:21.435 region:rollup2
FOISTING.

01:47:20.034 --> 01:47:23.137 region:rollup2
HIGHER PERCENTAGES ON FOLKS THAT

01:47:21.435 --> 01:47:24.772 region:rollup2
CAN'T GO ANYWHERE ELSE AND THE

01:47:23.137 --> 01:47:25.406 region:rollup2
END UP IN THE SAME PLACE THAT

01:47:24.772 --> 01:47:26.974 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THOSE LOANS

01:47:25.406 --> 01:47:28.542 region:rollup2
WERE MADE AVAILABLE TO THEM.

01:47:26.974 --> 01:47:29.877 region:rollup2
BORROWING MONEY FROM FRIENDS AND

01:47:28.542 --> 01:47:30.377 region:rollup2
FAMILY GOING TO PAWN SHOPS GOING

01:47:29.877 --> 01:47:32.346 region:rollup2
TO A LIAM SELLING THEIR

01:47:30.377 --> 01:47:34.048 region:rollup2
PROPERTY.

01:47:32.346 --> 01:47:35.316 region:rollup2
TO PAY BACK A LOAN OR THEY'RE

01:47:34.048 --> 01:47:36.984 region:rollup2
GOING TO DEFAULT AND THEY CAN'T

01:47:35.316 --> 01:47:38.585 region:rollup2
GET ANOTHER LOAN AT THE BACK TO

01:47:36.984 --> 01:47:41.088 region:rollup2
THE TO SQUARE ONE. AND SO THE

01:47:38.585 --> 01:47:42.122 region:rollup2
QUESTION AS IS INDICATED IN THE

01:47:41.088 --> 01:47:42.923 region:rollup2
REPORT IS

01:47:42.122 --> 01:47:44.258 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC THAT THE PRIMARY%

01:47:42.923 --> 01:47:45.993 region:rollup2
PUBLIC POLICY QUESTION RAISED BY

01:47:44.258 --> 01:47:47.461 region:rollup2
THIS BILL. IS AT WHAT POINT THE

01:47:45.993 --> 01:47:48.796 region:rollup2
BENEFITS OF ACCESS TO CAPITAL

01:47:47.461 --> 01:47:50.898 region:rollup2
OUTWEIGHED BY THE COSTS

01:47:48.796 --> 01:47:52.433 region:rollup2
DOES PROVIDING A HIGH COST LOAN

01:47:50.898 --> 01:47:54.134 region:rollup2
TO HOUSEHOLD AND FINANCIAL NEED.

01:47:52.433 --> 01:47:55.970 region:rollup2
DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD AND I

01:47:54.134 --> 01:47:56.603 region:rollup2
WOULD ARGUE THAT THE MAJORITY

01:47:55.970 --> 01:47:59.206 region:rollup2
THE TIME IT DOES MORE HARM THAN

01:47:56.603 --> 01:48:00.374 region:rollup2
GOOD.

01:47:59.206 --> 01:48:02.476 region:rollup2
THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA

01:48:00.374 --> 01:48:03.310 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER CERVANTES.

01:48:02.476 --> 01:48:05.012 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE FIRST OFF I WANT I

01:48:03.310 --> 01:48:06.447 region:rollup2
THINK THE CHAIR IN THE AUTHOR

01:48:05.012 --> 01:48:09.183 region:rollup2
FOR WORKING SO DILIGENTLY ON

01:48:06.447 --> 01:48:10.451 region:rollup2
THIS BILL AND BRING IN SOME

01:48:09.183 --> 01:48:11.785 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS TO THE TABLE?

01:48:10.451 --> 01:48:12.553 region:rollup2
THIS IS GONNA HAVE A LIVELY

01:48:11.785 --> 01:48:15.356 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION.

01:48:12.553 --> 01:48:17.591 region:rollup2
AND SINCE WE STARTED COMMITTEE.

01:48:15.356 --> 01:48:19.293 region:rollup2
I DO RECOGNIZE THIS BEING AN

01:48:17.591 --> 01:48:21.295 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FIRST STEP.

01:48:19.293 --> 01:48:23.430 region:rollup2
HOWEVER I STILL SEE A LOT OF

01:48:21.295 --> 01:48:25.666 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT DATA THAT'S.

01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:28.569 region:rollup2
IT'S LACKEY AND AS WE'VE HEARD.

01:48:25.666 --> 01:48:30.037 region:rollup2
ON BOTH SIDES.

01:48:28.569 --> 01:48:33.040 region:rollup2
I DO ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE

01:48:30.037 --> 01:48:35.008 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE MORE TIME TO FIND A

01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:36.877 region:rollup2
REASONABLE SOLUTION.

01:48:35.008 --> 01:48:39.646 region:rollup2
I'VE SPOKEN TO MANY ON BOTH

01:48:36.877 --> 01:48:43.350 region:rollup2
SIDES WHO ARE IN THIS ROOM.

01:48:39.646 --> 01:48:45.652 region:rollup2
SOME WHO ARE ALSO WILL LEAN. TO

01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:46.754 region:rollup2
FIND A PATH FORWARD.

01:48:45.652 --> 01:48:48.555 region:rollup2
WHICH IS SOMETHING I CERTAINLY

01:48:46.754 --> 01:48:50.090 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE.

01:48:48.555 --> 01:48:52.693 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SIX SOME CONCERNS I

01:48:50.090 --> 01:48:56.063 region:rollup2
HAVE ON UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.

01:48:52.693 --> 01:48:58.665 region:rollup2
PERHAPS WHERE CONSUMERS ARE LEAD

01:48:56.063 --> 01:48:59.767 region:rollup2
TO SITUATIONS THAT ARE NOT

01:48:58.665 --> 01:49:01.769 region:rollup2
ECONOMICALLY DESIRABLE.

01:48:59.767 --> 01:49:03.270 region:rollup2
ACCESS.

01:49:01.769 --> 01:49:05.439 region:rollup2
IS A BIG CONCERN.

01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:07.541 region:rollup2
AS WELL.

01:49:05.439 --> 01:49:09.410 region:rollup2
SHOULD THIS BILL.

01:49:07.541 --> 01:49:12.079 region:rollup2
REACH THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR I WILL

01:49:09.410 --> 01:49:14.281 region:rollup2
RE EXAMINE ITS MERITS THAN.

01:49:12.079 --> 01:49:16.016 region:rollup2
HOWEVER I DO WANT TO BE A PART

01:49:14.281 --> 01:49:17.751 region:rollup2
OF THIS ONGOING DISCUSSION

01:49:16.016 --> 01:49:20.154 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T AND TODAY.

01:49:17.751 --> 01:49:21.688 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO CONTINUE OUR WHATEVER

01:49:20.154 --> 01:49:23.190 region:rollup2
HAPPENS TODAY IN COMMITTEE.

01:49:21.688 --> 01:49:25.259 region:rollup2
BUT I WANT TO ASSURE THAT WE DO

01:49:23.190 --> 01:49:27.061 region:rollup2
STRIKE A BALANCE.

01:49:25.259 --> 01:49:28.829 region:rollup2
I BETWEEN PROTECTING CONSUMERS

01:49:27.061 --> 01:49:30.964 region:rollup2
AND PROVIDING ACCESS

01:49:28.829 --> 01:49:32.933 region:rollup2
AND I BELIEVE MANY ON ON THIS

01:49:30.964 --> 01:49:35.903 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE. MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES

01:49:32.933 --> 01:49:36.503 region:rollup2
TO RECOGNIZE THAT.

01:49:35.903 --> 01:49:40.374 region:rollup2
I STILL WITHOUT THOSE ARE MY

01:49:36.503 --> 01:49:42.176 region:rollup2
THOUGHTS.

01:49:40.374 --> 01:49:42.676 region:rollup2
BUT TIME MEMBER GRAYSON YES REAL

01:49:42.176 --> 01:49:44.178 region:rollup2
QUICK.

01:49:42.676 --> 01:49:46.580 region:rollup2
THE MILITARY NEGOTIATED A

01:49:44.178 --> 01:49:48.282 region:rollup2
THIRTY SIX PERCENT RATE CAP

01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:49.049 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT'S THE BACKGROUND OF

01:49:48.282 --> 01:49:51.018 region:rollup2
THAT HOW DID THE HOW DID THEY

01:49:49.049 --> 01:49:52.352 region:rollup2
GET TO THIRTY SIX PERCENT AND

01:49:51.018 --> 01:49:53.720 region:rollup2
WHY WAS THAT THE SWEET SPOT FOR

01:49:52.352 --> 01:49:55.122 region:rollup2
MILITARY.

01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:55.289 region:rollup2
THE.

01:49:55.122 --> 01:49:58.192 region:rollup2
THE.

01:49:55.289 --> 01:50:01.628 region:rollup2
.

01:49:58.192 --> 01:50:02.229 region:rollup2
THE MILITARY ALLMAN SECULAR HOOK

01:50:01.628 --> 01:50:02.863 region:rollup2
MY NOTES I I KNOW THAT I HAVE

01:50:02.229 --> 01:50:04.998 region:rollup2
MOVING.

01:50:02.863 --> 01:50:06.433 region:rollup2
BUT I DO KNOW THAT THE MILITARY

01:50:04.998 --> 01:50:07.000 region:rollup2
PUT PART OF THE REASON WHY THEY

01:50:06.433 --> 01:50:07.234 region:rollup2
RIDE AT THIRTY SIX PERCENT.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:08.502 region:rollup2
IS THAT.

01:50:07.234 --> 01:50:09.636 region:rollup2
.

01:50:08.502 --> 01:50:11.905 region:rollup2
THAT IS A WORM.

01:50:09.636 --> 01:50:13.674 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES ALREADY HAD IT AND

01:50:11.905 --> 01:50:14.842 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THIRD THAT THAT WAS

01:50:13.674 --> 01:50:16.677 region:rollup2
THE AND WE DO HAVE ARTICLES I

01:50:14.842 --> 01:50:19.179 region:rollup2
CAN SEND YOU AS WELL. THAT.

01:50:16.677 --> 01:50:20.781 region:rollup2
THAT THEIR ANALYSIS OF WHAT

01:50:19.179 --> 01:50:22.749 region:rollup2
THOSE OF THOSE STATES BEING AT

01:50:20.781 --> 01:50:23.650 region:rollup2
THIRTY SIX PERCENT FOUND THAT IT

01:50:22.749 --> 01:50:25.919 region:rollup2
BOTH ALLOWED FOR ACCESS TO

01:50:23.650 --> 01:50:27.921 region:rollup2
CREDIT. ABA WHILE PROTECTING THE

01:50:25.919 --> 01:50:29.690 region:rollup2
CONSUMER AND SO I THINK IT

01:50:27.921 --> 01:50:30.324 region:rollup2
REALLY FALLS IN LINE WITH THE

01:50:29.690 --> 01:50:31.558 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT THAT WE'RE MAKING IS

01:50:30.324 --> 01:50:34.328 region:rollup2
THAT. THERE'S A REASON WHY

01:50:31.558 --> 01:50:34.895 region:rollup2
THIRTY SIX PERCENT. OF HAS

01:50:34.328 --> 01:50:37.297 region:rollup2
BECOME A BENCHMARK FOR THESE

01:50:34.895 --> 01:50:38.432 region:rollup2
LOANS AND THERE'S A REASON WHY

01:50:37.297 --> 01:50:39.032 region:rollup2
THE MILITARY ADOPTED.

01:50:38.432 --> 01:50:39.233 region:rollup2
ATTACK THOSE THAT ARE SERVING

01:50:39.032 --> 01:50:40.701 region:rollup2
FOR.

01:50:39.233 --> 01:50:42.503 region:rollup2
.

01:50:40.701 --> 01:50:43.804 region:rollup2
ONE THING ABOUT THIRTY SIX

01:50:42.503 --> 01:50:44.738 region:rollup2
PERCENT THAT THE MILITARY ON THE

01:50:43.804 --> 01:50:45.539 region:rollup2
THAT THE MILITARY LENDING ACT

01:50:44.738 --> 01:50:47.541 region:rollup2
REQUIRES.

01:50:45.539 --> 01:50:49.009 region:rollup2
BOB.

01:50:47.541 --> 01:50:51.578 region:rollup2
ADMIRAL AB IT WAS QUOTED NATURAL

01:50:49.009 --> 01:50:53.413 region:rollup2
ALLEN IS THE CEO OF THE NAVY

01:50:51.578 --> 01:50:55.082 region:rollup2
MARINE RELIEF SOCIETY. REAL DATA

01:50:53.413 --> 01:50:56.483 region:rollup2
HERE AFTER THE THIRTY SIX

01:50:55.082 --> 01:50:57.284 region:rollup2
PERCENT WHEN AND.

01:50:56.483 --> 01:50:58.619 region:rollup2
THOUGHT HE WAS HE WAS QUOTED

01:50:57.284 --> 01:51:00.087 region:rollup2
SAYING OVER TRAP PROGRAMS HAVE

01:50:58.619 --> 01:51:01.955 region:rollup2
REPLACED PAYDAY LENDING AS THE

01:51:00.087 --> 01:51:03.724 region:rollup2
LEADING FINANCIAL PROBLEM. FOR

01:51:01.955 --> 01:51:05.659 region:rollup2
MANY MILITARY PERSONNEL.

01:51:03.724 --> 01:51:06.927 region:rollup2
SO IT'S IT'S NOT LIKE ONCE AGAIN

01:51:05.659 --> 01:51:08.729 region:rollup2
THE DOES THE MAN GO AWAY NO THEY

01:51:06.927 --> 01:51:10.130 region:rollup2
SEEK OUT OTHER OPTIONS

01:51:08.729 --> 01:51:12.432 region:rollup2
AND IN THIS CASE A THEY SOUGHT

01:51:10.130 --> 01:51:13.967 region:rollup2
OUT OVERDRAFT. AN OVERDRAFT.

01:51:12.432 --> 01:51:15.469 region:rollup2
CORNING NEW YORK POST I THINK

01:51:13.967 --> 01:51:17.471 region:rollup2
OF THIS WAS AN ARTICLE RECENTLY

01:51:15.469 --> 01:51:18.572 region:rollup2
THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN

01:51:17.471 --> 01:51:19.873 region:rollup2
THE U. S. OVERDRAFT PROTECTION

01:51:18.572 --> 01:51:22.075 region:rollup2
FEES.

01:51:19.873 --> 01:51:23.577 region:rollup2
AND INTERESTINGLY THE MOST

01:51:22.075 --> 01:51:25.412 region:rollup2
THAT'S IT THAT'S INCREASING IS

01:51:23.577 --> 01:51:26.413 region:rollup2
THE COSTA CREDIT UNIONS CREDIT

01:51:25.412 --> 01:51:28.081 region:rollup2
UNIONS ARE INCREASING THEIR OVER

01:51:26.413 --> 01:51:29.883 region:rollup2
TRAP COSTS.

01:51:28.081 --> 01:51:30.817 region:rollup2
A TO CONSUMERS SO ART ARE

01:51:29.883 --> 01:51:32.119 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ONCE AGAIN IS THAT IT

01:51:30.817 --> 01:51:33.654 region:rollup2
IS SHOWN WITH THE MILITARY

01:51:32.119 --> 01:51:35.122 region:rollup2
THERE'S TURNING TO ANOTHER FORM

01:51:33.654 --> 01:51:36.623 region:rollup2
OF LANDING. AND I WOULD IMAGINE

01:51:35.122 --> 01:51:38.258 region:rollup2
A MORE DIFFICULT AND DAMNING

01:51:36.623 --> 01:51:39.526 region:rollup2
FORM OF LENDING USING OVER

01:51:38.258 --> 01:51:40.627 region:rollup2
TRAFFIC A POTENTIALLY PUT YOUR

01:52:07.321 --> 01:52:09.089 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED.

01:52:08.922 --> 01:52:11.124 region:rollup2

FROM TEN THOUSAND DOWN TO FIVE

01:52:17.264 --> 01:52:20.334 region:rollup2
THOUSAND.

01:52:18.865 --> 01:52:21.235 region:rollup2
WE'VE HEARD THE DISCUSSION OF

01:52:20.334 --> 01:52:22.903 region:rollup2
CREDIT REPORTING AND HOW

01:52:21.235 --> 01:52:24.204 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAT IS BECAUSE I

01:52:22.903 --> 01:52:26.406 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT IS A

01:52:24.204 --> 01:52:27.674 region:rollup2
LADDER. AND A WAY TO HELP PEOPLE

01:52:26.406 --> 01:52:29.943 region:rollup2
OUT OF.

01:52:27.674 --> 01:52:30.210 region:rollup2
THEIR DEPENDENCY ON HIGH

01:52:29.943 --> 01:52:32.813 region:rollup2
INTEREST.

01:52:30.210 --> 01:52:33.447 region:rollup2
LOANS AND TO BE ABLE TO GET IN

01:52:32.813 --> 01:52:36.450 region:rollup2
TO THAT.

01:52:33.447 --> 01:52:37.784 region:rollup2
THE THE THE BANKING SYSTEM.

01:52:36.450 --> 01:52:39.753 region:rollup2
THE ORIGINATION FEE.

01:52:37.784 --> 01:52:41.188 region:rollup2
IN MY ESTIMATION I THOUGHT IT

01:52:39.753 --> 01:52:43.590 region:rollup2
WAS SEVEN PERCENT THAT.

01:52:41.188 --> 01:52:44.825 region:rollup2
THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME SOME

01:52:43.590 --> 01:52:46.293 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION THERE THAT NEEDS TO

01:52:44.825 --> 01:52:46.893 region:rollup2
TAKE PLACE AND THE OTHER THING

01:52:46.293 --> 01:52:47.894 region:rollup2
THAT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO

01:52:46.893 --> 01:52:50.297 region:rollup2
ME.

01:52:47.894 --> 01:52:52.165 region:rollup2
IS THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE A

01:52:50.297 --> 01:52:54.134 region:rollup2
MEANS OF PROTECTION.

01:52:52.165 --> 01:52:55.836 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE THAT ARE ENTERING INTO

01:52:54.134 --> 01:52:58.605 region:rollup2
SUCH A HIGH RISK.

01:52:55.836 --> 01:53:00.674 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY OF LOANING.

01:52:58.605 --> 01:53:03.276 region:rollup2
MONEY TO FOLKS WITHOUT CREDIT

01:53:00.674 --> 01:53:04.878 region:rollup2
OR VERY BAD CREDIT AND THERE

01:53:03.276 --> 01:53:06.813 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE A MEANS FOR THEM.

01:53:04.878 --> 01:53:08.682 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE WELL OUTSIDE OF THE

01:53:06.813 --> 01:53:10.817 region:rollup2
PARAMETER OF A CAP

01:53:08.682 --> 01:53:12.419 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO OUT WILL PROVIDE

01:53:10.817 --> 01:53:14.354 region:rollup2
COVERAGE FOR THEMSELF.

01:53:12.419 --> 01:53:15.789 region:rollup2
BLOOM LOAN INSURANCE.

01:53:14.354 --> 01:53:18.058 region:rollup2
A A COLLEAGUE SAID THAT.

01:53:15.789 --> 01:53:20.027 region:rollup2
THEY WERE VERY ENCOURAGED AND

01:53:18.058 --> 01:53:22.195 region:rollup2
APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR HARD WORK.

01:53:20.027 --> 01:53:24.364 region:rollup2
AND HOW THAT IT WAS.

01:53:22.195 --> 01:53:25.966 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAT THE CONVERSATION

01:53:24.364 --> 01:53:26.800 region:rollup2
CONTINUE.

01:53:25.966 --> 01:53:28.602 region:rollup2
AND THAT.

01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:30.771 region:rollup2
MY COLLEAGUE WAS VERY

01:53:28.602 --> 01:53:32.472 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE AND WANTED THAT.

01:53:30.771 --> 01:53:34.241 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION TO CONTINUE

01:53:32.472 --> 01:53:36.209 region:rollup2
THE ONLY WAY THAT CONVERSATION

01:53:34.241 --> 01:53:37.744 region:rollup2
CONTINUES IS IF THIS BILL GETS

01:53:36.209 --> 01:53:40.213 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE COMMITTEE OTHERWISE

01:53:37.744 --> 01:53:41.581 region:rollup2
YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST.

01:53:40.213 --> 01:53:43.116 region:rollup2
KILL IT RIGHT HERE AND THEN

01:53:41.581 --> 01:53:44.785 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO CONVERSATION

01:53:43.116 --> 01:53:46.820 region:rollup2
I WAS FACED WITH THE SITUATION

01:53:44.785 --> 01:53:50.157 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR. IN A COMMITTEE OF A

01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:51.124 region:rollup2
VERY. OF HARD CONTROVERSIAL BILL

01:53:50.157 --> 01:53:52.592 region:rollup2
THAT I WOULD CONSIDER LIKE INTO

01:53:51.124 --> 01:53:55.662 region:rollup2
THIS ONE.

01:53:52.592 --> 01:53:57.664 region:rollup2
AND THE THE THE THING THAT I

01:53:55.662 --> 01:53:59.900 region:rollup2
THOUGHT WAS THE WISEST TO DO WAS

01:53:57.664 --> 01:54:01.535 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALLOWED

01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:03.203 region:rollup2
BOTH SIDES TO CONTINUE TO WORK

01:54:01.535 --> 01:54:04.671 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE MADE. SOME

01:54:03.203 --> 01:54:07.341 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS MOVEMENT.

01:54:04.671 --> 01:54:09.609 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY TODAY IN OUR TALKS.

01:54:07.341 --> 01:54:10.177 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE SHOWN TO ME THAT THERE

01:54:09.609 --> 01:54:11.578 region:rollup2
WAS SOME GOOD FAITH ON YOUR

01:54:10.177 --> 01:54:11.845 region:rollup2
PART.

01:54:11.578 --> 01:54:14.815 region:rollup2
I JUST.

01:54:11.845 --> 01:54:16.616 region:rollup2
I WILL I WILL HAVE THE THEM I

01:54:14.815 --> 01:54:17.851 region:rollup2
WILL. HAVE THE BENEFIT AND

01:54:16.616 --> 01:54:19.720 region:rollup2
RESERVATION.

01:54:17.851 --> 01:54:21.521 region:rollup2
THAT IF THIS BILL DOES NOT

01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:23.190 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THESE KIND OF THINGS IF

01:54:21.521 --> 01:54:24.991 region:rollup2
IT GETS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE.

01:54:23.190 --> 01:54:26.827 region:rollup2
AND THE CONVERSATIONS DON'T TAKE

01:54:24.991 --> 01:54:28.195 region:rollup2
PLACE THAT NEED TO TAKE PLACE

01:54:26.827 --> 01:54:29.596 region:rollup2
THAN I I WOULD.

01:54:28.195 --> 01:54:31.798 region:rollup2
RESERVE THE RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO

01:54:29.596 --> 01:54:33.033 region:rollup2
NOT SUPPORT ANYTHING THAT MAY

01:54:31.798 --> 01:54:33.200 region:rollup2
END UP ON THE FLOOR.

01:54:33.033 --> 01:54:34.768 region:rollup2
SO.

01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:38.939 region:rollup2
.

01:54:34.768 --> 01:54:39.639 region:rollup2
HAVING SAID THAT.

01:54:38.939 --> 01:54:42.509 region:rollup2
THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:54:39.639 --> 01:54:43.176 region:rollup2

WANT TO THANK YOU ALSO KNOW YOU

01:54:44.745 --> 01:54:48.348 region:rollup2

BILL YOU AS WELL AS THE CHAIR

01:54:48.348 --> 01:54:51.952 region:rollup2

01:54:50.183 --> 01:54:53.453 region:rollup2
FACING THIS. PROBLEM.

01:54:51.952 --> 01:54:54.554 region:rollup2
AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENT

01:54:53.453 --> 01:54:55.822 region:rollup2
SORRY I WAS LATE I WAS TEARING

01:54:54.554 --> 01:54:58.158 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET COMMITTEE SO WE JUST

01:54:55.822 --> 01:54:59.092 region:rollup2
FINISHED.

01:54:58.158 --> 01:55:00.927 region:rollup2
SUMMER YOU BASSAM SOME CRITICAL

01:54:59.092 --> 01:55:02.729 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS BILL AND

01:55:00.927 --> 01:55:04.498 region:rollup2
JUST LET ME SAY THIS THAT FIVE

01:55:02.729 --> 01:55:05.665 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO. YOU MAY HAVE BEEN ON

01:55:04.498 --> 01:55:08.401 region:rollup2
IT WITH ME TOO I'M NOT SURE IF

01:55:05.665 --> 01:55:08.969 region:rollup2
IAN WAS ON THE BANKING COMMITTEE

01:55:08.401 --> 01:55:09.269 region:rollup2
FIVE YEARS AGO I WAS ON THIS

01:55:08.969 --> 01:55:10.303 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE.

01:55:09.269 --> 01:55:11.538 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE MOST

01:55:10.303 --> 01:55:13.106 region:rollup2
CONTROVERSIAL THINGS CAME UP

01:55:11.538 --> 01:55:14.841 region:rollup2
WITH THIS SO IT'S NOT AN OLD NEW

01:55:13.106 --> 01:55:16.743 region:rollup2
TOPIC IT'S A RATHER OLD TOP

01:55:14.841 --> 01:55:17.978 region:rollup2
ACUTE THE CAPITAL THE KIND OF

01:55:16.743 --> 01:55:19.045 region:rollup2
GOALS IN CIRCLES.

01:55:17.978 --> 01:55:20.213 region:rollup2
WITH DATA AND INFORMATION AND

01:55:19.045 --> 01:55:21.715 region:rollup2
ALWAYS WITH THE THREAT THAT

01:55:20.213 --> 01:55:22.516 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WILL ALL THESE THINGS

01:55:21.715 --> 01:55:22.682 region:rollup2
WILL GO AWAY.

01:55:22.516 --> 01:55:24.518 region:rollup2
AND.

01:55:22.682 --> 01:55:25.585 region:rollup2
.

01:55:24.518 --> 01:55:26.820 region:rollup2
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE OUTCOME OF

01:55:25.585 --> 01:55:28.655 region:rollup2
IT BUT OBVIOUSLY WE DIDN'T PASS

01:55:26.820 --> 01:55:29.990 region:rollup2
THE BILL AT LEAST WE DID NOT THE

01:55:28.655 --> 01:55:31.391 region:rollup2
FLOOR SOMETHING HAPPEN.

01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:33.560 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THE CONVERSATION IS

01:55:31.391 --> 01:55:34.661 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND IT IS

01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:36.430 region:rollup2
SPECIALLY IF YOU COMMUNITIES I

01:55:34.661 --> 01:55:37.631 region:rollup2
HAVE A. A DISTRICT THAT HAS A

01:55:36.430 --> 01:55:38.231 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING IN IT

01:55:37.631 --> 01:55:40.100 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WERE AFFLUENT

01:55:38.231 --> 01:55:41.535 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES WE HAVE LOTS OF

01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:43.036 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND WHAT HAVE YOU. AND

01:55:41.535 --> 01:55:44.704 region:rollup2
I ALSO HAVE THE HEART OF SAN

01:55:43.036 --> 01:55:46.406 region:rollup2
DIEGO OF RIGHT NEXT TO LORRAINE

01:55:44.704 --> 01:55:47.974 region:rollup2
IS DISTRICT WHERE. OF WHAT WE

01:55:46.406 --> 01:55:49.643 region:rollup2
HAVE THESE CHALLENGES AND THE

01:55:47.974 --> 01:55:51.578 region:rollup2
THING I'VE NOTICED MORE RECENTLY

01:55:49.643 --> 01:55:54.548 region:rollup2
TO SEE IT IS EASIER TO GET. TO A

01:55:51.578 --> 01:55:56.483 region:rollup2
PAYDAY LOAN OR OR A CARLENE

01:55:54.548 --> 01:55:56.683 region:rollup2
PLACE THAN IT IS TO GET TO A

01:55:56.483 --> 01:55:58.919 region:rollup2
BANK.

01:55:56.683 --> 01:56:00.687 region:rollup2
THERE ARE VERY FEW BANKS IN AND

01:55:58.919 --> 01:56:02.522 region:rollup2
CREDIT UNIONS IMPORT COMMUNITIES

01:56:00.687 --> 01:56:04.357 region:rollup2
SO ALMOST NO CREDIT UNIONS

01:56:02.522 --> 01:56:06.626 region:rollup2
BUT THEY ARE SURELY VERY VERY

01:56:04.357 --> 01:56:07.227 region:rollup2
FEW BANKS IN THESE COMMUNITIES

01:56:06.626 --> 01:56:07.894 region:rollup2
AND THE FACT THAT I CAN THINK

01:56:07.227 --> 01:56:09.262 region:rollup2
OF.

01:56:07.894 --> 01:56:10.630 region:rollup2
TO A THREE FACILITIES RIGHT NOW

01:56:09.262 --> 01:56:12.899 region:rollup2
ON MY DISTRICT WITH A ONCE FOR

01:56:10.630 --> 01:56:14.367 region:rollup2
BANKS ANOTHER CAR LOAN PLACES.

01:56:12.899 --> 01:56:16.102 region:rollup2
OF THE SO THE BANKING IS GONE

01:56:14.367 --> 01:56:17.537 region:rollup2
ALMOST IN POOR COMMUNITIES AND

01:56:16.102 --> 01:56:19.406 region:rollup2
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE.

01:56:17.537 --> 01:56:21.007 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT JUST THE

01:56:19.406 --> 01:56:22.976 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO KNOW A

01:56:21.007 --> 01:56:24.377 region:rollup2
BANK AND TO BE A PART OF IT AND

01:56:22.976 --> 01:56:26.046 region:rollup2
SAVE A LITTLE MONEY AND YOU KNOW

01:56:24.377 --> 01:56:26.580 region:rollup2
DEVELOP SOME RELATIONSHIP THAT

01:56:26.046 --> 01:56:27.581 region:rollup2
PEOPLE USED TO DEVELOPMENT

01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:29.449 region:rollup2
BANKS.

01:56:27.581 --> 01:56:31.151 region:rollup2
DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE SO NOW OUR

01:56:29.449 --> 01:56:32.986 region:rollup2
OUR COMMUNITIES ARE LEFT TO THIS

01:56:31.151 --> 01:56:34.521 region:rollup2
AS THE OPTION.

01:56:32.986 --> 01:56:36.523 region:rollup2
AND EITHER SOMEONE DIES YOU GOT

01:56:34.521 --> 01:56:37.524 region:rollup2
A PROBLEM EITHER THEM GOLD OVER

01:56:36.523 --> 01:56:38.725 region:rollup2
THERE AND DO THAT OR YOU DON'T

01:56:37.524 --> 01:56:40.327 region:rollup2
HAVE A CAR WATCH THIS SPECIALTY

01:56:38.725 --> 01:56:42.062 region:rollup2
NOW AND POOR COMMUNITIES AT CAR

01:56:40.327 --> 01:56:44.297 region:rollup2
WASHES THE FUNERALS OKAY. BUT

01:56:42.062 --> 01:56:44.898 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN INNOVATIVE I MEAN AT

01:56:44.297 --> 01:56:45.832 region:rollup2
LEAST YOU DON'T UP AND DID YOU

01:56:44.898 --> 01:56:46.566 region:rollup2
KNOW YOU.

01:56:45.832 --> 01:56:48.902 region:rollup2
WE MAY WATCH A WHOLE BUNCH OF

01:56:46.566 --> 01:56:49.469 region:rollup2
CARS AND DELAY THE FUNERAL BUT

01:56:48.902 --> 01:56:50.604 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HE'D YOU DO WHAT YOU

01:56:49.469 --> 01:56:52.038 region:rollup2
GOTTA DO.

01:56:50.604 --> 01:56:53.306 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THIS CONVERSATION IS

01:56:52.038 --> 01:56:55.275 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AND IT HAS TO GO

01:56:53.306 --> 01:56:56.910 region:rollup2
FORWARD THAT YOU KNOW THE IDEA

01:56:55.275 --> 01:56:58.945 region:rollup2
THAT. THE PEOPLE ARE HEARING A

01:56:56.910 --> 01:57:01.248 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND SOME ODD PERCENT OF

01:56:58.945 --> 01:57:02.749 region:rollup2
TOUR OF FOR SOME COMPANY REMINDS

01:57:01.248 --> 01:57:03.783 region:rollup2
ME OF WHAT FOLKS TALK BACK IN

01:57:02.749 --> 01:57:05.552 region:rollup2
THE IN THE THIRTIES AND FORTIES

01:57:03.783 --> 01:57:07.821 region:rollup2
ABOUT LOAN SHARKS IN COMMUNITIES

01:57:05.552 --> 01:57:08.655 region:rollup2
AND. LENDING MONEY AND YOU KNOW

01:57:07.821 --> 01:57:10.290 region:rollup2
YOU HAD BEHIND PERCENT RIGHT

01:57:08.655 --> 01:57:11.558 region:rollup2
AWAY AND AND THEN THE FACT THAT

01:57:10.290 --> 01:57:13.727 region:rollup2
OTHER THINGS HAPPEN TO PEOPLE OF

01:57:11.558 --> 01:57:15.729 region:rollup2
THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL. AND I KNOW

01:57:13.727 --> 01:57:17.464 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HAVING LIVED ALL MY

01:57:15.729 --> 01:57:18.465 region:rollup2
LIFE AND POOR COMMUNITIES IN A

01:57:17.464 --> 01:57:20.133 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:57:18.465 --> 01:57:21.201 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THOSE HOLES

01:57:20.133 --> 01:57:22.035 region:rollup2
ARE SO DEEP.

01:57:21.201 --> 01:57:24.538 region:rollup2
UNLESS YOU HAVE A RELATIVE WHO

01:57:22.035 --> 01:57:25.572 region:rollup2
CAN FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW YOU JUST

01:57:24.538 --> 01:57:26.773 region:rollup2
YOU JUST KEEP GOING ANY GOALS

01:57:25.572 --> 01:57:29.075 region:rollup2
AND IT GOES IN AND IT'S

01:57:26.773 --> 01:57:30.176 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATE. OF THAT IMPACTS

01:57:29.075 --> 01:57:31.745 region:rollup2
FAMILIES IN THE WAY THAT IT DOES

01:57:30.176 --> 01:57:32.879 region:rollup2
SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS

01:57:31.745 --> 01:57:33.780 region:rollup2
BILL BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT

01:57:32.879 --> 01:57:35.048 region:rollup2
YOU'VE DONE I KNOW YOU GOT

01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:36.016 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES THAT OF THE

01:57:35.048 --> 01:57:38.218 region:rollup2
AND WE ALWAYS SERVE THE

01:57:36.016 --> 01:57:39.953 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY. TOOK TO PULL BACK

01:57:38.218 --> 01:57:41.888 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THE CONVERSATION IS

01:57:39.953 --> 01:57:42.889 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AND WHEN FOLKS THAT I

01:57:41.888 --> 01:57:44.958 region:rollup2
THINK THIS HAS BEEN HERE BEFORE

01:57:42.889 --> 01:57:47.093 region:rollup2
YESTERDAY AS I KNOW WAS HERE. IN

01:57:44.958 --> 01:57:48.695 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY THIRTEEN BECAUSE I WAS

01:57:47.093 --> 01:57:51.264 region:rollup2
ON THE COMMITTEE AND TWENTY

01:57:48.695 --> 01:57:56.169 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN WE HAVE AND YOU MAY

01:57:51.264 --> 01:57:57.671 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN YOU TO YES A.

01:57:56.169 --> 01:57:59.139 region:rollup2
IN THE CONVERSATION AT TWENTY

01:57:57.671 --> 01:57:59.773 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN SO THIS IS IT THIS IS A

01:57:59.139 --> 01:58:00.607 region:rollup2
SUBJECT THAT'S GONE AROUND AND

01:57:59.773 --> 01:58:02.108 region:rollup2
AROUND AND WE HAVE TO FACE IT.

01:58:00.607 --> 01:58:03.376 region:rollup2
THAT IS AN INDUSTRY HERE AND NO

01:58:02.108 --> 01:58:05.579 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY LIKES REGULATION I HAVE

01:58:03.376 --> 01:58:06.880 region:rollup2
IT AT AS I STUDIED HISTORY. A I

01:58:05.579 --> 01:58:08.481 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW INDUSTRYYET BUT LIKE

01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:09.950 region:rollup2
RIGID REGULATION THE LABOR

01:58:08.481 --> 01:58:11.751 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY DIDN'T LET ME LIKE

01:58:09.950 --> 01:58:12.686 region:rollup2
REGULATION BUT THOUGH THE A

01:58:11.751 --> 01:58:14.754 region:rollup2
PRIVATE ENTRY DID WHEN HE CAME

01:58:12.686 --> 01:58:16.089 region:rollup2
TO. BASICALLY ALL YOUTH WORKERS

01:58:14.754 --> 01:58:18.558 region:rollup2
CHILD LABOR NOBODY LIKE

01:58:16.089 --> 01:58:19.592 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS NOBODY LIKES TO BE

01:58:18.558 --> 01:58:21.328 region:rollup2
SAID YOU HAVE TO DO THIS VERSUS

01:58:19.592 --> 01:58:22.562 region:rollup2
THAT BANKS DON'T EVEN REALLY

01:58:21.328 --> 01:58:23.930 region:rollup2
LIKE REGULATION THEY'VE LEARNED

01:58:22.562 --> 01:58:26.266 region:rollup2
TO LIVE WITH THAT. AND WHEN WE

01:58:23.930 --> 01:58:28.935 region:rollup2
DEREGULATE THAT WE KNOW WHAT

01:58:26.266 --> 01:58:30.570 region:rollup2
HAPPENED SO WE NO ONE LIKES

01:58:28.935 --> 01:58:32.606 region:rollup2
REGULATION AND ESTIMATE AND AS

01:58:30.570 --> 01:58:35.575 region:rollup2
LONG AS YOU'RE ABLE TO OPERATE

01:58:32.606 --> 01:58:37.077 region:rollup2
WITHOUT IT YOU WILL OKAY. ARE IF

01:58:35.575 --> 01:58:40.046 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE REGULATION THINGS

01:58:37.077 --> 01:58:40.513 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES BUSINESS FIGURE OUT

01:58:40.046 --> 01:58:40.847 region:rollup2
HOW TO WORK WITHIN THE

01:58:40.513 --> 01:58:41.481 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS.

01:58:40.847 --> 01:58:42.115 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WE SHOULD TRY TO

01:58:41.481 --> 01:58:42.782 region:rollup2
MAKE THE REGULATIONS REASONABLE

01:58:42.115 --> 01:58:43.316 region:rollup2
SO THAT THAT THE BUSINESSES KID

01:58:42.782 --> 01:58:44.784 region:rollup2
WHO CHOOSE TO REMAIN CAN'T

01:58:43.316 --> 01:58:45.819 region:rollup2
SURVIVE. BUT IT'S IT SEEMS

01:58:44.784 --> 01:58:47.153 region:rollup2
ALWAYS UNREASONABLE TO ME THAT.

01:58:45.819 --> 01:58:48.788 region:rollup2
I CAN ONLY GET SOMETHING IF I

01:58:47.153 --> 01:58:50.056 region:rollup2
JUST HAVE IT IF SOMEBODY'S

01:58:48.788 --> 01:58:51.725 region:rollup2
HOLDING OVER MY HEAD HAVE TO PAY

01:58:50.056 --> 01:58:53.259 region:rollup2
THOSE ZILLION DOLLARS TO GET

01:58:51.725 --> 01:58:54.427 region:rollup2
THIS BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY

01:58:53.259 --> 01:58:56.096 region:rollup2
WON'T GIVE IT TO ME. YOU KNOW

01:58:54.427 --> 01:58:57.464 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S YOU AND WE HEAR THAT

01:58:56.096 --> 01:58:59.232 region:rollup2
SO OFTEN IN POOR COMMUNITIES

01:58:57.464 --> 01:59:00.333 region:rollup2
WHERE RESOURCES ARE SO LIMITED

01:58:59.232 --> 01:59:01.768 region:rollup2
THAT WE BROUGHT YOU FRESH

01:59:00.333 --> 01:59:03.770 region:rollup2
VEGETABLES INSTEAD OF THE ALL

01:59:01.768 --> 01:59:05.605 region:rollup2
VEGETABLES YOU LATE COST YOU SO

01:59:03.770 --> 01:59:07.240 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE. AND YOU WONDER WHY IS

01:59:05.605 --> 01:59:08.208 region:rollup2
AN ORANGE IN MY COMMUNITY SO

01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:10.276 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE.

01:59:08.208 --> 01:59:12.045 region:rollup2
WAS IT A SPECIAL TRUCK A LIMO A

01:59:10.276 --> 01:59:13.580 region:rollup2
ROLLS ROYCE THAT BROUGHT IT IF

01:59:12.045 --> 01:59:14.814 region:rollup2
NO IT WAS BROUGHT IN FROM

01:59:13.580 --> 01:59:15.949 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT WAS OLD AND

01:59:14.814 --> 01:59:17.717 region:rollup2
SO. OFTEN TIMES ARE FIGHTING

01:59:15.949 --> 01:59:18.952 region:rollup2
THESE BATTLES THAT WE THINK WE

01:59:17.717 --> 01:59:19.986 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE TO FIGHT WITH PEOPLE

01:59:18.952 --> 01:59:21.354 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE TIME TO FIGHT THEM

01:59:19.986 --> 01:59:22.922 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES

01:59:21.354 --> 01:59:24.557 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO.

01:59:22.922 --> 01:59:26.192 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T HAVE THE THE THE THE

01:59:24.557 --> 01:59:28.662 region:rollup2
SPIRIT ANYMORE JUST TO FIGHT THE

01:59:26.192 --> 01:59:29.095 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS THAT COULD POSSIBLY

01:59:28.662 --> 01:59:29.429 region:rollup2
BRING THEM SOMETHING

01:59:29.095 --> 01:59:31.097 region:rollup2
SO.

01:59:29.429 --> 01:59:32.899 region:rollup2
SO I I APPRECIATE OF MY

01:59:31.097 --> 01:59:34.000 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUE GO.

01:59:32.899 --> 01:59:35.335 region:rollup2
THE FROM SAN JOSE.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.603 region:rollup2
TAKEN THIS AS A ISSUE NAY HAS

01:59:35.335 --> 01:59:38.304 region:rollup2
SINCE HE'S BEEN HERE AND

01:59:36.603 --> 01:59:39.706 region:rollup2
FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT OUGHT I

01:59:38.304 --> 01:59:40.874 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE MY NEW CHAIR WHO'S

01:59:39.706 --> 01:59:42.208 region:rollup2
WHO'S STANDING THERE WITH THE

01:59:40.874 --> 01:59:43.810 region:rollup2
MEN AND I ASKED THE REST OF US

01:59:42.208 --> 01:59:45.045 region:rollup2
TO HAVE SOME FAITH IN THE FACT.

01:59:43.810 --> 01:59:47.113 region:rollup2
pTHAT IF WE IF WE BECOME

01:59:45.045 --> 01:59:48.681 region:rollup2
REASONABLE AND REGULATE THIS

01:59:47.113 --> 01:59:51.151 region:rollup2
THAT IT WILL STILL SERVE A VERY

01:59:48.681 --> 01:59:53.453 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PURPOSE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:59:51.151 --> 01:59:54.387 region:rollup2
AND IT WILL BE FAIR TO FOLKS WHO

01:59:53.453 --> 01:59:55.655 region:rollup2
ARE STRUGGLING THE MOST

01:59:54.387 --> 01:59:57.257 region:rollup2
IT'S ALMOST LIKE WHEN YOU ON THE

01:59:55.655 --> 01:59:59.826 region:rollup2
BOTTOM SUBMITTED TO STEPS ON YOU

01:59:57.257 --> 02:00:01.394 region:rollup2
KNOW. AND AND AND AND THAT NONE

01:59:59.826 --> 02:00:02.028 region:rollup2
OF US WOULD TAKE OUT ANYTHING

02:00:01.394 --> 02:00:04.097 region:rollup2
THERE'S A HUNDRED AND SOME ODD

02:00:02.028 --> 02:00:06.166 region:rollup2
PERCENT ALONE I MEAN THAT WOULD

02:00:04.097 --> 02:00:07.100 region:rollup2
JUST BE WE THINK WE'VE LOST OUR

02:00:06.166 --> 02:00:08.802 region:rollup2
MIND WE STRUGGLE AND FIGURE OUT

02:00:07.100 --> 02:00:09.803 region:rollup2
HOW TO DO SOME OF THE WAY. BUT

02:00:08.802 --> 02:00:11.471 region:rollup2
THAT'S BECAUSE WE SEE OURSELVES

02:00:09.803 --> 02:00:12.305 region:rollup2
WITH OPTIONS AND RESOURCES

02:00:11.471 --> 02:00:13.840 region:rollup2
AND SOMETIMES THOSE COMMUNITIES

02:00:12.305 --> 02:00:15.475 region:rollup2
DON'T SEE IT AND SOME AND WE

02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:17.477 region:rollup2
HAVE TO PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF

02:00:15.475 --> 02:00:18.545 region:rollup2
SUPPORT OR COVER FOR THEM IN

02:00:17.477 --> 02:00:21.081 region:rollup2
TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT THE

02:00:18.545 --> 02:00:22.582 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY. UGH REGULATES ITSELF

02:00:21.081 --> 02:00:23.783 region:rollup2
UP BUT THAT WE PARTICIPATE IN

02:00:22.582 --> 02:00:27.554 region:rollup2
THAT REGULATION AND PUTS THEM

02:00:23.783 --> 02:00:29.222 region:rollup2
CAPS AND LIMITS ON.

02:00:27.554 --> 02:00:31.591 region:rollup2
THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER

02:00:29.222 --> 02:00:33.226 region:rollup2
AYE I THINK THAT THIS HAS BEEN A

02:00:31.591 --> 02:00:34.627 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION I

02:00:33.226 --> 02:00:35.128 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THE AMOUNT OF TIME

02:00:34.627 --> 02:00:36.262 region:rollup2
THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS

02:00:35.128 --> 02:00:37.964 region:rollup2
INVESTED.

02:00:36.262 --> 02:00:39.265 region:rollup2
I WOULD AGREE THAT THE

02:00:37.964 --> 02:00:40.667 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE AT TEAM HAS BEEN

02:00:39.265 --> 02:00:42.168 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLY SUPPORTIVE BUT I ALSO

02:00:40.667 --> 02:00:43.503 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THIS DISCUSSION IS

02:00:42.168 --> 02:00:45.238 region:rollup2
REFLECTIVE OF HOW IMPORTANT THIS

02:00:43.503 --> 02:00:48.174 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION IS. IT HAS BEEN

02:00:45.238 --> 02:00:48.842 region:rollup2
NOTED OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT

02:00:48.174 --> 02:00:50.410 region:rollup2
THIS IS A HISTORICAL

02:00:48.842 --> 02:00:51.778 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION IT DIDN'T COME UP

02:00:50.410 --> 02:00:53.546 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR IT DIDN'T COME UP FIVE

02:00:51.778 --> 02:00:54.681 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO IT DID COME UP TEN

02:00:53.546 --> 02:00:56.116 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO. AND SO WHEN THIS

02:00:54.681 --> 02:00:57.884 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE STARTED THINKING ABOUT

02:00:56.116 --> 02:01:00.153 region:rollup2
THIS PARTICULAR BILL WE ACTUALLY

02:00:57.884 --> 02:01:02.555 region:rollup2
WENT TO HISTORY WE WENT TO WHEN

02:01:00.153 --> 02:01:04.824 region:rollup2
THE FIRST THAT KIND OF LAWS WERE

02:01:02.555 --> 02:01:06.326 region:rollup2
PASSED THE LOUD. OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:01:04.824 --> 02:01:08.261 region:rollup2
THIS AND WE THOUGHT TO OURSELVES

02:01:06.326 --> 02:01:10.530 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS THE GENESIS AROUND THAT

02:01:08.261 --> 02:01:12.398 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS THE THINKING ON AND IT

02:01:10.530 --> 02:01:15.869 region:rollup2
WAS AND RECOGNITION THAT OUR

02:01:12.398 --> 02:01:16.503 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES DO INDEED HAVE

02:01:15.869 --> 02:01:18.171 region:rollup2
LIMITED ACCESS.

02:01:16.503 --> 02:01:20.006 region:rollup2
AND WE BELIEVE THAT I BELIEVE

02:01:18.171 --> 02:01:22.175 region:rollup2
THAT I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE

02:01:20.006 --> 02:01:23.676 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO I'VE WORKED WITH IN

02:01:22.175 --> 02:01:25.411 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY I REPRESENT AND

02:01:23.676 --> 02:01:27.247 region:rollup2
ALL THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THAT

02:01:25.411 --> 02:01:29.315 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:01:27.247 --> 02:01:30.550 region:rollup2
WALK INTO A BANK THAT DON'T HAVE

02:01:29.315 --> 02:01:32.819 region:rollup2
A RELATIVE WHO CAN GIVE THEM

02:01:30.550 --> 02:01:33.920 region:rollup2
ALONE ON THE SPOT. I BELIEVE

02:01:32.819 --> 02:01:35.522 region:rollup2
THAT AND.

02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:36.990 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE I THINK IS A

02:01:35.522 --> 02:01:38.525 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE THAT THAT'S WHERE THIS

02:01:36.990 --> 02:01:40.360 region:rollup2
CAME FROM FROM UNDERSTANDING

02:01:38.525 --> 02:01:41.794 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WAS A TRUE ISSUE ON IN

02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:43.229 region:rollup2
OUR COMMUNITY BUT I WANT TO

02:01:41.794 --> 02:01:44.531 region:rollup2
QUOTE ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO

02:01:43.229 --> 02:01:45.598 region:rollup2
SAID THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

02:01:44.531 --> 02:01:47.400 region:rollup2
TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE

02:01:45.598 --> 02:01:48.635 region:rollup2
BETWEEN ACCESS. AND PROTECTING

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:49.602 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS.

02:01:48.635 --> 02:01:50.170 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT THIS IS WHAT

02:01:49.602 --> 02:01:52.105 region:rollup2
IT'S ABOUT.

02:01:50.170 --> 02:01:53.506 region:rollup2
UP.

02:01:52.105 --> 02:01:55.141 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE WE'VE STUDIED

02:01:53.506 --> 02:01:56.442 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE SEVERAL FOLKS HAVE

02:01:55.141 --> 02:01:57.877 region:rollup2
TALKED TO WES I AM AND I WAS

02:01:56.442 --> 02:01:59.412 region:rollup2
HANDED A VERY USEFUL ARTICLE

02:01:57.877 --> 02:02:00.847 region:rollup2
ABOUT SOUTH DAKOTA.

02:01:59.412 --> 02:02:03.349 region:rollup2
AND WHAT HAPPENED WHEN SOUTH

02:02:00.847 --> 02:02:04.884 region:rollup2
DAKOTA KIND OF WENT TO THIS.

02:02:03.349 --> 02:02:07.320 region:rollup2
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT A

02:02:04.884 --> 02:02:09.989 region:rollup2
RED STATE VOTED.

02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:12.392 region:rollup2
CAP THEMSELVES ON THIS ISSUE.

02:02:09.989 --> 02:02:14.327 region:rollup2
AND SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT THAT I

02:02:12.392 --> 02:02:15.762 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT WHAT IT DID ENSURE

02:02:14.327 --> 02:02:16.563 region:rollup2
THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES AND I

02:02:15.762 --> 02:02:17.897 region:rollup2
HOPE THAT THOSE ARE

02:02:16.563 --> 02:02:19.399 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS THAT WE WILL HAVE

02:02:17.897 --> 02:02:20.767 region:rollup2
SHOULD THIS BILL MOVED FORWARD.

02:02:19.399 --> 02:02:23.369 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS.

02:02:20.767 --> 02:02:25.772 region:rollup2
BUT THE PUBLIC WANTS THIS

02:02:23.369 --> 02:02:27.574 region:rollup2
AND IF THE RED CONSERVATIVE

02:02:25.772 --> 02:02:29.943 region:rollup2
STATE LIKE SOUTH DAKOTA. ON

02:02:27.574 --> 02:02:31.778 region:rollup2
WANTS THIS I ALSO THINK THAT I

02:02:29.943 --> 02:02:32.979 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY HERE IN

02:02:31.778 --> 02:02:34.647 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TO LEAD THE

02:02:32.979 --> 02:02:35.882 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION HERE.

02:02:34.647 --> 02:02:37.317 region:rollup2
IF THIS CONVERSATION WENT TO THE

02:02:35.882 --> 02:02:39.586 region:rollup2
BALLOT.

02:02:37.317 --> 02:02:40.320 region:rollup2
WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE WE ARE

02:02:39.586 --> 02:02:42.388 region:rollup2
STATE THAT LIKE A LOT ABOUT

02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:43.456 region:rollup2
ENOUGH FOR THEM AND EATEN IT

02:02:42.388 --> 02:02:45.024 region:rollup2
WOULD GO IN A DIFFERENT

02:02:43.456 --> 02:02:46.693 region:rollup2
DIRECTION AND THOSE OF US WHO

02:02:45.024 --> 02:02:49.329 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT INVESTED HOURS AND

02:02:46.693 --> 02:02:51.464 region:rollup2
HOURS EXPERTS. ON BOTH SIDES

02:02:49.329 --> 02:02:52.832 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION INCLUDED WOULD NOT

02:02:51.464 --> 02:02:54.801 region:rollup2
HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF

02:02:52.832 --> 02:02:56.836 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY AND SO I THINK IT'S

02:02:54.801 --> 02:02:59.405 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US AYE TO

02:02:56.836 --> 02:02:59.639 region:rollup2

ENCOURAGE WHAT I'VE HEARD OVER

02:03:07.780 --> 02:03:10.917 region:rollup2
AND OVER FROM THE OPPOSITION

02:03:09.482 --> 02:03:12.218 region:rollup2
THAT YOU ARE INTERESTED IN

02:03:10.917 --> 02:03:13.987 region:rollup2
WORKING ON THIS.

02:03:12.218 --> 02:03:14.988 region:rollup2
AND I THINK YOU BRING A SUBJECT

02:03:13.987 --> 02:03:16.756 region:rollup2
MATTER EXPERTISE THAT IS

02:03:14.988 --> 02:03:18.258 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO THE TABLE I THINK

02:03:16.756 --> 02:03:19.692 region:rollup2
IT'S ONE THAT PROVIDES VALUE TO

02:03:18.258 --> 02:03:21.394 region:rollup2

02:03:21.394 --> 02:03:24.831 region:rollup2
HOPE YOU WILL BECAUSE THERE'S

02:03:23.329 --> 02:03:27.200 region:rollup2
ALSO FORMER BILLS THAT.

02:03:24.831 --> 02:03:29.002 region:rollup2
WORK IN A SPACE THAT.

02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:30.470 region:rollup2
REQUIRES US TO THINK ABOUT WHAT

02:03:29.002 --> 02:03:31.871 region:rollup2
THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE WHEN

02:03:30.470 --> 02:03:33.907 region:rollup2
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A

02:03:31.871 --> 02:03:35.909 region:rollup2
BANK AND SO I HOPE THAT THAT'S

02:03:33.907 --> 02:03:37.443 region:rollup2
ON A GENUINE INTEREST I FEEL

02:03:35.909 --> 02:03:38.978 region:rollup2

IF THIS PARTICULAR BILL DOESN'T

02:14:14.046 --> 02:14:17.249 region:rollup2
BILL DIFFERENTLY ANSWER BILL SO

02:14:15.347 --> 02:14:18.050 region:rollup2
MAYBE BRIGHT WELL SO SO MY DO

02:14:17.249 --> 02:14:19.518 region:rollup2

02:14:19.518 --> 02:14:22.821 region:rollup2
EVERY YEAR WE HAVE TO SUBMIT IT

02:14:21.053 --> 02:14:24.123 region:rollup2

SUBCHAPTER RATS OR SEE COURT.

02:14:30.396 --> 02:14:32.765 region:rollup2

THAT IS READILY AVAILABLE IN A

02:14:35.601 --> 02:14:39.405 region:rollup2
PDF ONLINE RIGHT NOW WE CAN ALL

02:14:37.770 --> 02:14:40.839 region:rollup2
LOOK UP LIKE FOR EXAMPLE I THINK

02:14:39.405 --> 02:14:41.674 region:rollup2
WE LOOKED UP DAVID HADLEY'S AND

02:14:40.839 --> 02:14:43.642 region:rollup2
SENT IT OFF.

02:14:41.674 --> 02:14:44.710 region:rollup2
TO SHOW WHAT YOU KNOW HOW YOU

02:14:43.642 --> 02:14:46.245 region:rollup2
CAN JUST EASILY PULL ITS

02:14:44.710 --> 02:14:46.812 region:rollup2
INFORMATION IN A FIGHT WHERE

02:14:46.245 --> 02:14:49.315 region:rollup2
SOMEONE LIVES AND SEE THEIR

02:14:46.812 --> 02:14:50.182 region:rollup2
PERSONAL SIGNATURE AND WITH ALL

02:14:49.315 --> 02:14:51.116 region:rollup2

02:14:50.182 --> 02:14:52.718 region:rollup2
NOW WITH MAIL. THEFT AND

02:14:51.116 --> 02:14:53.652 region:rollup2
IDENTITY THEFT IN ALL OF THINGS

02:14:52.718 --> 02:14:59.224 region:rollup2
GOING ON THAT JUST SEEMS LIKE

02:14:53.652 --> 02:15:00.392 region:rollup2
WAY TOO INVASIVE TO BE ONLINE.

02:14:59.224 --> 02:15:00.960 region:rollup2
SO WE WERE JUST GETTING

02:15:00.392 --> 02:15:02.461 region:rollup2
CLARIFICATION THAT AND THAT

02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:04.096 region:rollup2
THAT%

02:15:02.461 --> 02:15:05.965 region:rollup2
IS THE PRACTICE OF BUT THE

02:15:04.096 --> 02:15:07.733 region:rollup2
SECRETARY OF STATE. DOES SAY

02:15:05.965 --> 02:15:09.401 region:rollup2

ADDRESS THEY REQUIRE THE

02:15:09.401 --> 02:15:13.405 region:rollup2
SIGNATURE ON AND I THINK THAT

02:15:11.136 --> 02:15:15.507 region:rollup2
THE ANALYSIS TRIES TO MENTION

02:15:13.405 --> 02:15:16.842 region:rollup2
THAT THAT MEANT THAT. PRACTICES

02:15:15.507 --> 02:15:18.577 region:rollup2

.

02:15:23.015 --> 02:15:26.151 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBLE ADDRESS THAT I THINK

02:15:25.584 --> 02:15:29.855 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DISCUSS

02:15:26.151 --> 02:15:31.156 region:rollup2
FURTHER.

NO I DON'T I DON'T HAVE THE DATA

02:15:38.230 --> 02:15:40.699 region:rollup2
TO KNOW THAT I WOULD HAVE TO

02:15:39.932 --> 02:15:42.267 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

02:15:40.699 --> 02:15:43.769 region:rollup2
FIND OUT THAT I KNOW THAT WE

02:15:42.267 --> 02:15:45.371 region:rollup2
HAVE SEEN A SPIKE DRAMATICALLY

02:15:43.769 --> 02:15:46.939 region:rollup2
AND. AND PROPERTY CRIME WE'VE

02:15:45.371 --> 02:15:48.340 region:rollup2
SEEN A SPECTER MEDICALLY AND

02:15:46.939 --> 02:15:49.475 region:rollup2
THEN MAIL THEFT WITHOUT A SPIKE

02:15:48.340 --> 02:15:50.376 region:rollup2

02:15:49.475 --> 02:15:51.310 region:rollup2
AT ITS MARTELL WHEN YOU'RE

02:15:50.376 --> 02:15:52.745 region:rollup2
COMING OFF OF THE RIGHT ONE AND

02:15:51.310 --> 02:15:54.480 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S NOT

02:15:52.745 --> 02:15:55.047 region:rollup2
RELEVANT BECAUSE YET THAT'S. THE

02:15:54.480 --> 02:15:57.082 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS OFF OF THIS FORM

02:15:55.047 --> 02:16:00.119 region:rollup2
AND.

02:15:57.082 --> 02:16:01.920 region:rollup2
HOW OFTEN THIS IS?

02:16:00.119 --> 02:16:02.955 region:rollup2

IDENTIFY THIS ISSUE AND.

02:16:20.205 --> 02:16:23.142 region:rollup2
AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY THEY

02:16:21.807 --> 02:16:24.376 region:rollup2
THINK AN APPROPRIATE REMEDY

02:16:23.142 --> 02:16:26.311 region:rollup2
WOULD BE WELL WE'VE JUST HEARD

02:16:24.376 --> 02:16:28.714 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY THAT PUTTING A A PO

02:16:26.311 --> 02:16:29.281 region:rollup2
BOX OR A ALTERNATE ADDRESS WOULD

02:16:28.714 --> 02:16:30.282 region:rollup2
BE AWAY A WORKAROUND AROUND

02:16:29.281 --> 02:16:31.183 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:16:30.282 --> 02:16:32.751 region:rollup2
BUT CERTAINLY STILL DOESN'T

02:16:31.183 --> 02:16:33.352 region:rollup2
ELIMINATE THE CHALLENGE THAT WE

02:16:32.751 --> 02:16:35.387 region:rollup2

ANYBODY TO TO HELP THEMSELVES TO

02:16:40.592 --> 02:16:42.995 region:rollup2

SPECIFICALLY I DON'T KNOW. BUT

02:17:00.212 --> 02:17:03.048 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY IT'S A QUITE AN

02:17:01.413 --> 02:17:04.183 region:rollup2

ONE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION

THESE EXORBITANT INTEREST RATES

02:23:04.409 --> 02:23:06.244 region:rollup2
COUPLED WITH LENDERS FAILURE TO

REPOSSESSIONS.

02:23:12.384 --> 02:23:14.953 region:rollup2
NOT THE FEDERAL LEVEL I WITH

02:23:13.452 --> 02:23:16.388 region:rollup2
THAT TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S

UNDERMINED.

02:23:25.664 --> 02:23:27.599 region:rollup2
SO IT'S REALLY UP TO THE STATE

02:23:26.298 --> 02:23:29.000 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA TO TAKE A STAND ON

02:23:27.599 --> 02:23:30.769 region:rollup2

02:23:46.751 --> 02:23:50.989 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WORKING TO WIDEN THE

02:23:48.019 --> 02:23:51.623 region:rollup2
RACIAL WEALTH GAP WHICH IS THE

DISPARITY OF WEALTH HOLDEN BIKE

02:23:51.623 --> 02:23:53.892 region:rollup2

DISCRIMINATORY LENDING

02:23:58.130 --> 02:24:00.932 region:rollup2

02:23:59.264 --> 02:24:02.667 region:rollup2
PREDATORY LENDERS TARGET PEOPLE

KNOW NEIGHBORHOODS AND THESE

02:24:05.403 --> 02:24:07.405 region:rollup2
LETTERS EXPLOIT THE FACT THAT

02:24:06.037 --> 02:24:08.840 region:rollup2
PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE MORE LIKELY

02:24:07.405 --> 02:24:10.175 region:rollup2

REDLINING.

02:24:10.175 --> 02:24:12.644 region:rollup2
THE PRIVATE SECTOR PRACTICE OF

EXISTS.

02:24:16.548 --> 02:24:19.784 region:rollup2
AS A RESPONSE TO THAT.

02:24:18.216 --> 02:24:20.752 region:rollup2

02:30:53.411 --> 02:30:56.047 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS IS WE GO FORWARD AND

02:30:55.146 --> 02:30:57.315 region:rollup2
I THINK MANY OF YOU ON THE

02:30:56.047 --> 02:30:59.117 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE INCLUDING THE CHAIR I

02:30:57.315 --> 02:31:00.018 region:rollup2
THANK YOU ALL OF. A LOT MOST OF

YOU HAVE BEEN IN ONE OF OUR

02:31:00.018 --> 02:31:02.387 region:rollup2
STORES BEFORE YOU UNDERSTAND OUR

02:31:01.419 --> 02:31:04.055 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS AND.

02:31:02.387 --> 02:31:06.090 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS CONVERSATION'S BEEN

02:31:04.055 --> 02:31:07.392 region:rollup2
VERY HELPFUL AND IT IS

02:31:06.090 --> 02:31:08.493 region:rollup2
HISTORICAL I FEEL LIKE UPSET

02:31:07.392 --> 02:31:09.627 region:rollup2
MISTER SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE

02:31:08.493 --> 02:31:11.062 region:rollup2
YEARS AND I HAVE.

02:31:09.627 --> 02:31:12.330 region:rollup2
I KNOW IT'S LATE WE'VE GOT

02:31:11.062 --> 02:31:14.566 region:rollup2
DINNERS WITH MOM AND BASKETBALL

02:31:12.330 --> 02:31:15.266 region:rollup2
GAMES TO GO SEE BUT I JUST WANNA

02:31:14.566 --> 02:31:17.835 region:rollup2
MAKE A COUPLE OF QUICK POINTS IN

02:31:15.266 --> 02:31:18.870 region:rollup2
OUT. ON LEAVE IT ALONE BUT YOU

02:31:17.835 --> 02:31:21.439 region:rollup2
KNOW IT.

02:31:18.870 --> 02:31:23.808 region:rollup2
WE REPOSSESSED LESS THAN THREE

02:31:21.439 --> 02:31:24.609 region:rollup2
CARS PER LOCATION LAST YEAR.

02:31:23.808 --> 02:31:26.110 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT BIG

02:31:24.609 --> 02:31:27.278 region:rollup2
NUMBERS FROM THE DB ó I DON'T

02:31:26.110 --> 02:31:28.413 region:rollup2
KNOW WHO IT IS THAT'S DOING THAT

02:31:27.278 --> 02:31:28.913 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S NOT MY COMPANY.

02:31:28.413 --> 02:31:30.448 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT THE WAY WE DO

02:31:28.913 --> 02:31:31.816 region:rollup2
BUSINESS.

02:31:30.448 --> 02:31:33.718 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE DO ARE

02:31:31.816 --> 02:31:35.687 region:rollup2
FEDERAL REGULATOR PUT OUT A BI

02:31:33.718 --> 02:31:37.288 region:rollup2
ANNUAL REPORT TODAY THAT COVERED

02:31:35.687 --> 02:31:38.656 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.

02:31:37.288 --> 02:31:40.124 region:rollup2
AND THE TALK ABOUT COMPLAINTS OF

02:31:38.656 --> 02:31:41.993 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS FOR EVERY FINANCIAL

02:31:40.124 --> 02:31:44.329 region:rollup2
PRODUCT IN AMERICA.

02:31:41.993 --> 02:31:46.197 region:rollup2
TITLE LOANS WAS POINT.

02:31:44.329 --> 02:31:47.865 region:rollup2
ONE PERCENT.

02:31:46.197 --> 02:31:48.499 region:rollup2
OF ALL THE COMPLAINTS THAT WHAT

02:31:47.865 --> 02:31:49.400 region:rollup2
THE VETERAN YOU LATER POINT ONE

02:31:48.499 --> 02:31:51.336 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

02:31:49.400 --> 02:31:51.869 region:rollup2
SO I I DON'T THINK OUR CUSTOMERS

02:31:51.336 --> 02:31:52.937 region:rollup2
ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE

02:31:51.869 --> 02:31:55.540 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS

02:31:52.937 --> 02:31:57.241 region:rollup2
BUT I POINT THIS OUT REAL QUICK.

02:31:55.540 --> 02:31:58.209 region:rollup2
WE TALKED ABOUT MARILYN YOUNG

02:31:57.241 --> 02:31:58.776 region:rollup2
BROTHER MARYLAND YOU DON'T WHY

02:31:58.209 --> 02:31:59.310 region:rollup2
MARYLAND OF HAVING LENDING

02:31:58.776 --> 02:32:01.612 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S THIRTY THREE

02:31:59.310 --> 02:32:03.081 region:rollup2
PERCENT. THIS BILL WILL PUT US

02:32:01.612 --> 02:32:05.416 region:rollup2
AT A BUSINESS AS IS MADAM CHAIR

02:32:03.081 --> 02:32:07.085 region:rollup2
BUT WE ARE OPEN TO REFORM WE

02:32:05.416 --> 02:32:08.086 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS

02:32:07.085 --> 02:32:09.654 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT

02:32:08.086 --> 02:32:11.122 region:rollup2
DISCLOSURES AND I WAS OF A POINT

02:32:09.654 --> 02:32:12.957 region:rollup2
OF. CONTENTION REPOSSESSIONS A

02:32:11.122 --> 02:32:14.692 region:rollup2
POINT OF CONTENTION THINGS THAT

02:32:12.957 --> 02:32:15.760 region:rollup2
WE ARE VERY VERY MUCH IN FAVOR

02:32:14.692 --> 02:32:18.229 region:rollup2
OF TALKING WITH YOU ABOUT SO

02:32:15.760 --> 02:32:22.467 region:rollup2
WITH THAT MISTER VICE CHAIR I

02:32:18.229 --> 02:32:23.735 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE THE ABOUT TIME TO.

02:32:22.467 --> 02:32:25.603 region:rollup2
OKAY IT JUGGLING REPRESENTING

02:32:23.735 --> 02:32:27.071 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY LOANS OF AMERICA THAT

02:32:25.603 --> 02:32:30.208 region:rollup2
OF MEDICARE.

02:32:27.071 --> 02:32:31.642 region:rollup2
THE.

02:32:30.208 --> 02:32:32.377 region:rollup2
EXIT LA THINGS TO SAY THAT I

02:32:31.642 --> 02:32:33.978 region:rollup2
THINK FOR THE MOST PART THE

02:32:32.377 --> 02:32:34.445 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT I WAS GOING TO SAY

02:32:33.978 --> 02:32:35.713 region:rollup2
HAVE ALREADY BEEN SET.

02:32:34.445 --> 02:32:38.683 region:rollup2
.

02:32:35.713 --> 02:32:39.417 region:rollup2
I WILL SAY OUR CUSTOMERS.

02:32:38.683 --> 02:32:41.352 region:rollup2
TEND TO BE IN THREE DIFFERENT

02:32:39.417 --> 02:32:43.921 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES.

02:32:41.352 --> 02:32:45.723 region:rollup2
THEY TEND TO BE INDEPENDENTLY

02:32:43.921 --> 02:32:47.525 region:rollup2
OWNED BUSINESSES WHO DON'T HAVE

02:32:45.723 --> 02:32:49.127 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO CAPITAL.

02:32:47.525 --> 02:32:50.662 region:rollup2
AND WHO NEED ACCESS TO CAPITAL

02:32:49.127 --> 02:32:53.698 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES THEIR VEHICLE THEIR

02:32:50.662 --> 02:32:55.466 region:rollup2
TRUCK IS THEIR PRIMARY ASSET.

02:32:53.698 --> 02:32:56.768 region:rollup2
AND THEY NEED THAT ABILITY TO

02:32:55.466 --> 02:32:58.770 region:rollup2
HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL TO

02:32:56.768 --> 02:32:59.871 region:rollup2
PERFORM THEIR JOB WHETHER IT'S

02:32:58.770 --> 02:33:01.139 region:rollup2
IN THE PAINTING BUSINESS A

02:32:59.871 --> 02:33:02.640 region:rollup2
LANDSCAPE BUSINESS.

02:33:01.139 --> 02:33:04.475 region:rollup2
UP THE SECOND.

02:33:02.640 --> 02:33:06.277 region:rollup2
MAJOR.

02:33:04.475 --> 02:33:07.779 region:rollup2
PART OF OUR BUSINESS ARE IN FACT

02:33:06.277 --> 02:33:09.447 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT ARE UNBANKED

02:33:07.779 --> 02:33:10.281 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE ACCESS

02:33:09.447 --> 02:33:12.417 region:rollup2
TO GO TO TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL

02:33:10.281 --> 02:33:13.918 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS.

02:33:12.417 --> 02:33:15.820 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY ARE UNBANKED.

02:33:13.918 --> 02:33:18.289 region:rollup2
AND THE THIRD ARE THOSE PEOPLE

02:33:15.820 --> 02:33:20.491 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE CREDIT SCORES.

02:33:18.289 --> 02:33:22.493 region:rollup2
BELOW SIX TWENTY.

02:33:20.491 --> 02:33:24.328 region:rollup2
MAYBE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW.

02:33:22.493 --> 02:33:26.197 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE OF THAT OR HAVE NO

02:33:24.328 --> 02:33:27.732 region:rollup2
CREDIT HISTORY AT ALL.

02:33:26.197 --> 02:33:28.800 region:rollup2
FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT IF NOT

02:33:27.732 --> 02:33:32.770 region:rollup2
IMPOSSIBLE TO GO TO TRADITIONAL

02:33:28.800 --> 02:33:35.106 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL.

02:33:32.770 --> 02:33:36.474 region:rollup2
EARLIER TODAY BY HAND DISCUSSING

02:33:35.106 --> 02:33:38.342 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMAN BECAUSE BILL I THINK

02:33:36.474 --> 02:33:40.078 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE.

02:33:38.342 --> 02:33:42.213 region:rollup2
POSE THE RIGHT QUESTION

02:33:40.078 --> 02:33:44.082 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS WHAT IS THE RIGHT

02:33:42.213 --> 02:33:46.250 region:rollup2
BALANCE BETWEEN ACCESS.

02:33:44.082 --> 02:33:47.418 region:rollup2
AND NOT.

02:33:46.250 --> 02:33:49.087 region:rollup2
CREATING UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

02:33:47.418 --> 02:33:51.756 region:rollup2
FOR ACCESS

02:33:49.087 --> 02:33:54.025 region:rollup2
VERSUS MAKING SURE THAT.

02:33:51.756 --> 02:33:55.493 region:rollup2
THE CONSUMER TAKING ADVANTAGE OF

02:33:54.025 --> 02:33:56.694 region:rollup2
ONE OF THESE PRODUCTS ISN'T

02:33:55.493 --> 02:33:58.329 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY SETTING THEMSELVES

02:33:56.694 --> 02:34:00.398 region:rollup2
UP FOR THIS.

02:33:58.329 --> 02:34:02.100 region:rollup2
VORTEX OF DEBT.

02:34:00.398 --> 02:34:02.934 region:rollup2
AND THE STEPS SPIRAL INTO

02:34:02.100 --> 02:34:04.969 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT CAN NEVER BE PAID

02:34:02.934 --> 02:34:05.837 region:rollup2
OFF.

02:34:04.969 --> 02:34:08.573 region:rollup2
THAT BALLOTS IS I THINK WHAT'S

02:34:05.837 --> 02:34:10.108 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

02:34:08.573 --> 02:34:11.976 region:rollup2
AN INTEREST RATE CAP BY ITSELF

02:34:10.108 --> 02:34:13.745 region:rollup2
DOESN'T REALLY PROVIDE.

02:34:11.976 --> 02:34:16.314 region:rollup2
WHAT IT WILL DO

02:34:13.745 --> 02:34:18.015 region:rollup2
IS IT WILL MAKE SURE THAT A LOT

02:34:16.314 --> 02:34:19.884 region:rollup2
OF ACCESS TO CREDIT WILL NO

02:34:18.015 --> 02:34:22.754 region:rollup2
LONGER BE ACCESSIBLE?

02:34:19.884 --> 02:34:24.789 region:rollup2
ON THE OTHER HAND.

02:34:22.754 --> 02:34:26.757 region:rollup2
BALANCING.

02:34:24.789 --> 02:34:29.560 region:rollup2
THIS PRODUCT WITH A VARIETY OF

02:34:26.757 --> 02:34:32.697 region:rollup2
TOOLS THAT I THINK ARE AVAILABLE

02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:34.232 region:rollup2
AT THIS COMMITTEES.

02:34:32.697 --> 02:34:36.601 region:rollup2
URGING I THINK MAKES A LOT OF

02:34:34.232 --> 02:34:37.568 region:rollup2
SENSE.

02:34:36.601 --> 02:34:39.570 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THE

02:34:37.568 --> 02:34:40.838 region:rollup2
WITNESSES TODAY TALK ABOUT WHAT

02:34:39.570 --> 02:34:44.308 region:rollup2
ARE THE POLICIES RIGHT NOW WHAT

02:34:40.838 --> 02:34:46.244 region:rollup2
WHAT DO WE DO IN THE BUSINESS.

02:34:44.308 --> 02:34:47.578 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS DON'T EXIST IN

02:34:46.244 --> 02:34:49.447 region:rollup2
RULES AND STATUTES OR

02:34:47.578 --> 02:34:51.682 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS BY AND LARGE.

02:34:49.447 --> 02:34:53.084 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE NON RECOURSE LOANS

02:34:51.682 --> 02:34:53.551 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU STOP THAT DEATH

02:34:53.084 --> 02:34:55.787 region:rollup2
SPIRAL OF.

02:34:53.551 --> 02:34:56.988 region:rollup2
OF DEBT.

02:34:55.787 --> 02:34:58.623 region:rollup2
THE FIRST THING IS TO MAKE SURE

02:34:56.988 --> 02:35:00.291 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THESE LOANS ARE NON

02:34:58.623 --> 02:35:01.492 region:rollup2
RECOURSE LOANS WHICH MEANS

02:35:00.291 --> 02:35:02.827 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE GOING

02:35:01.492 --> 02:35:04.896 region:rollup2
AFTER THE PERSON AND FORCING

02:35:02.827 --> 02:35:07.465 region:rollup2
THEM INTO BANKRUPTCY.

02:35:04.896 --> 02:35:08.599 region:rollup2
OF IF WE REPOSSESS THE CAR AND

02:35:07.465 --> 02:35:10.034 region:rollup2
OUR. REPOSSESSION RATE IS

02:35:08.599 --> 02:35:11.736 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN WHAT

02:35:10.034 --> 02:35:13.771 region:rollup2
WAS DISCUSSED BUT IF THAT IN

02:35:11.736 --> 02:35:14.772 region:rollup2
FACT IT'S A CONCERN AND

02:35:13.771 --> 02:35:16.107 region:rollup2
RIGHTFULLY SHOULD BE IF IT.

02:35:14.772 --> 02:35:18.576 region:rollup2
IF REPOSSESSION RATES ARE TWENTY

02:35:16.107 --> 02:35:19.644 region:rollup2
PERCENT THAT'S TOO HIGH.

02:35:18.576 --> 02:35:21.379 region:rollup2
IF WE REPOSSESS THE CAR WE'VE

02:35:19.644 --> 02:35:22.346 region:rollup2
ALREADY LOST.

02:35:21.379 --> 02:35:24.115 region:rollup2
IT'S A LOSING PROPOSITION FROM

02:35:22.346 --> 02:35:25.817 region:rollup2
THE WORD GO.

02:35:24.115 --> 02:35:28.119 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW TO

02:35:25.817 --> 02:35:29.520 region:rollup2
HAVE A NOR DO WE LIKE WE

02:35:28.119 --> 02:35:30.755 region:rollup2
POSSESSING A CAR BECAUSE WE

02:35:29.520 --> 02:35:32.123 region:rollup2
ALREADY LOST MONEY WE'RE NEVER

02:35:30.755 --> 02:35:32.723 region:rollup2
GOING TO RECOVER WHAT'S BEEN

02:35:32.123 --> 02:35:34.792 region:rollup2
LOST.

02:35:32.723 --> 02:35:36.694 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF CAPITAL.

02:35:34.792 --> 02:35:38.429 region:rollup2
BUT MAKING SURE THAT THE LOAN IS

02:35:36.694 --> 02:35:39.764 region:rollup2
A NON CREE RECOURSE LOAN.

02:35:38.429 --> 02:35:41.732 region:rollup2
STOPS THE DESPOT OR RIGHT THERE.

02:35:39.764 --> 02:35:43.835 region:rollup2
OF.

02:35:41.732 --> 02:35:44.402 region:rollup2
NEVADA HAS THE STATUE.

02:35:43.835 --> 02:35:46.204 region:rollup2
THAT IS CENTURY PROVIDES AN

02:35:44.402 --> 02:35:47.505 region:rollup2
OFFERING.

02:35:46.204 --> 02:35:49.307 region:rollup2
TUMORS AND THAT OFFRAMP.

02:35:47.505 --> 02:35:51.209 region:rollup2
STOPS

02:35:49.307 --> 02:35:53.277 region:rollup2
TOLLING OF THE INTEREST RATE.

02:35:51.209 --> 02:35:55.546 region:rollup2
SO THAT IF IN FACT THE CONSUMER

02:35:53.277 --> 02:35:57.682 region:rollup2
FIND THEMSELVES IN A PLACE WHERE

02:35:55.546 --> 02:35:59.116 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY ARE LATE OR IN

02:35:57.682 --> 02:36:01.619 region:rollup2
DEFAULT. THERE'S A WAY TO SAVE

02:35:59.116 --> 02:36:03.287 region:rollup2
TIME OUTLETS RESTRUCTURED CREATE

02:36:01.619 --> 02:36:04.188 region:rollup2
A REPAYMENT PLAN THAT DOESN'T

02:36:03.287 --> 02:36:07.892 region:rollup2
ADD MORE INTEREST TO THE LAW.

02:36:04.188 --> 02:36:09.694 region:rollup2
.

02:36:07.892 --> 02:36:12.697 region:rollup2
VERIFYING THE VALUE OF THE

02:36:09.694 --> 02:36:14.732 region:rollup2
VEHICLE NEAR AT TWO MINUTES

02:36:12.697 --> 02:36:17.735 region:rollup2
BECAUSE NONE OF US ARE OUT YOU

02:36:14.732 --> 02:36:18.569 region:rollup2
KNOW WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT THAT I'M

02:36:17.735 --> 02:36:19.871 region:rollup2
GONNA HAVE.

02:36:18.569 --> 02:36:20.404 region:rollup2
I HAVE SIX OTHER THINGS HERE.

02:36:19.871 --> 02:36:20.805 region:rollup2
ALL WHICH I THINK A GOOD

02:36:20.404 --> 02:36:22.440 region:rollup2
BUSINESS PRACTICES

02:36:20.805 --> 02:36:23.541 region:rollup2
WATCHING LOAN TO VALUE.

02:36:22.440 --> 02:36:24.575 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE AREN'T

02:36:23.541 --> 02:36:26.544 region:rollup2
MONNING MORE THE ACTUAL VALUE OF

02:43:07.478 --> 02:43:10.981 region:rollup2
THAT WAS NOTHING WOULD HAVE

02:43:10.981 --> 02:43:16.287 region:rollup2
IT WILL FOR JUST THAT AMOUNT

02:43:15.719 --> 02:43:20.024 region:rollup2
THEIR OTHER AMOUNTS THAT ARE

02:43:16.287 --> 02:43:20.924 region:rollup2

02:43:24.128 --> 02:43:27.364 region:rollup2
WITH THAT MADAM CHAIR WOULD YOU

02:43:25.296 --> 02:43:29.366 region:rollup2
LIKE TO CLOSE THINK YOU AYE IT

02:43:27.364 --> 02:43:30.167 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I I WANT TO SAY THAT AT

THEIR TWENTY FIVE STATES PLUS

02:43:30.167 --> 02:43:33.771 region:rollup2
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA THAT

02:43:32.302 --> 02:43:34.471 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE CAR TITLE.

02:43:33.771 --> 02:43:35.406 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

02:43:34.471 --> 02:43:36.006 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA

02:43:35.406 --> 02:43:37.675 region:rollup2
WOULD BE JOINING THESE TWENTY

02:43:36.006 --> 02:43:39.009 region:rollup2
FIVE CENT STATES PLUS THE

02:43:37.675 --> 02:43:40.177 region:rollup2
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA I ALSO WANT

02:43:39.009 --> 02:43:41.612 region:rollup2
HIM BUT JUST CLARIFY SOMETHING

02:43:40.177 --> 02:43:43.213 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP A LOT

02:43:41.612 --> 02:43:44.481 region:rollup2
IT'S ABOUT DATA DATA DATA. ON

02:43:43.213 --> 02:43:45.549 region:rollup2
OUR DB ó REPORT THAT CAME OUT

02:43:44.481 --> 02:43:46.984 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR I TALKED ABOUT THE

02:43:45.549 --> 02:43:50.788 region:rollup2
TWENTY THOUSAND CARS THAT WERE

02:43:46.984 --> 02:43:53.991 region:rollup2
REPOSSESS AT A HUNDRED AND EAT.

02:43:50.788 --> 02:43:54.491 region:rollup2
I THOUSAND ASK ORIGINATION.

02:43:53.991 --> 02:43:55.592 region:rollup2
TITLES AND I THINK IT'S

02:43:54.491 --> 02:43:57.327 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO CLARIFY THAT THIS

02:43:55.592 --> 02:43:59.496 region:rollup2
INFORMATION IS GATHERED. BY

02:43:57.327 --> 02:44:00.531 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT THE COMPANY'S

02:43:59.496 --> 02:44:02.099 region:rollup2
PRESENT AND SIGN OFF ON THIS IS

02:44:00.531 --> 02:44:04.335 region:rollup2
NOT ABSTRACT DATA. SO THIS

02:44:02.099 --> 02:44:07.304 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT GOES TO THE DB

02:44:04.335 --> 02:44:08.872 region:rollup2
ó IS INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN.

02:44:07.304 --> 02:44:11.675 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SENT AS FACTUAL

02:44:08.872 --> 02:44:12.543 region:rollup2
INFORMATION EVERY COMPANY IN

02:44:11.675 --> 02:44:14.478 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SIGNS OFF TO IT SO I

02:44:12.543 --> 02:44:16.180 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WHILE THERE IS NO

02:44:14.478 --> 02:44:20.417 region:rollup2
DOUBT THAT MORE INFORMATION IS

02:44:16.180 --> 02:44:22.653 region:rollup2
HELPFUL I DON'T WANT. TO AYE YOU

02:44:20.417 --> 02:44:24.655 region:rollup2
TO TO KIND OF SCRUTINIZE THE THE

02:44:22.653 --> 02:44:27.424 region:rollup2
INTEGRITY OF THAT DATA WHAT WE

02:44:24.655 --> 02:44:30.027 region:rollup2
DO HAVE DOES TELL US SOMETHING

02:44:27.424 --> 02:44:31.028 region:rollup2
AND IT'S SOMETHINGTHAT HELPS US

02:44:30.027 --> 02:44:32.429 region:rollup2
MOVE IN A DIRECTION.

02:44:31.028 --> 02:44:34.798 region:rollup2
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US HAS A

02:44:32.429 --> 02:44:35.499 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENT OR TWO OR THREE OR

02:44:34.798 --> 02:44:36.633 region:rollup2
MORE IN OUR DISTRICT THAT

02:44:35.499 --> 02:44:37.835 region:rollup2
REPRESENTS THESE TWENTY THOUSAND

02:44:36.633 --> 02:44:39.703 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO HAD THEIR CARDS

02:44:37.835 --> 02:44:41.472 region:rollup2
REPOSSESSED.

02:44:39.703 --> 02:44:44.041 region:rollup2
THAT CAR IS A MEAN TO GET TO AND

02:44:41.472 --> 02:44:46.343 region:rollup2
FROM WORK THAT CAR IS A MEANS TO

02:44:44.041 --> 02:44:47.978 region:rollup2
GET TO THEIR SCHOOLS IT'S I MEAN

02:44:46.343 --> 02:44:50.714 region:rollup2
TO GET ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE

02:44:47.978 --> 02:44:53.150 region:rollup2
THIS IS REAL. BUT IMPACT OF

02:44:50.714 --> 02:44:55.152 region:rollup2
LOSING THAT CAR IS FAR BEYOND

02:44:53.150 --> 02:44:56.920 region:rollup2
JUST NOT BEING ABLE TO MAKE A

02:44:55.152 --> 02:44:59.056 region:rollup2
PAYMENT IT HAS IMPACTS FOR EVERY

02:44:56.920 --> 02:45:01.225 region:rollup2
SINGLE ONE OF US IN OUR DISTRICT

02:44:59.056 --> 02:45:02.526 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE REPRESENT PEOPLE WHO

02:45:01.225 --> 02:45:04.661 region:rollup2
HAVE LOST THEIR CAR. AND SO WHAT

02:45:02.526 --> 02:45:06.163 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO ENSURE

02:45:04.661 --> 02:45:07.264 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM SOME OF

02:45:06.163 --> 02:45:09.299 region:rollup2
THE LESSONS THAT HAVE HAPPENED

02:45:07.264 --> 02:45:10.968 region:rollup2
IN OUR COUNTRY IN OUR STATE

02:45:09.299 --> 02:45:12.302 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY AROUND BLENDING WE

02:45:10.968 --> 02:45:14.471 region:rollup2
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT LENDING

02:45:12.302 --> 02:45:16.540 region:rollup2
DECISIONS. ARE BASED ON THE

02:45:14.471 --> 02:45:20.310 region:rollup2
CONSUMER CONSUMERS ABILITY TO

02:45:16.540 --> 02:45:21.445 region:rollup2
REPAY THE LOAN AND NOT THE VALUE

02:45:20.310 --> 02:45:23.781 region:rollup2
OF THE ASSET.

02:45:21.445 --> 02:45:24.381 region:rollup2
THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

02:45:23.781 --> 02:45:26.416 region:rollup2
THAT'S HOW SO MANY PEOPLE LOST

02:45:24.381 --> 02:45:27.751 region:rollup2
HOMES.

02:45:26.416 --> 02:45:37.461 region:rollup2
