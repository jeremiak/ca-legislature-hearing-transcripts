00:38:32.743 --> 00:38:34.178
THIS TIME WE HAVE BEEN TRYING

00:38:34.245 --> 00:38:36.180
TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP.

00:38:36.247 --> 00:38:38.015
AND WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO

00:38:38.082 --> 00:38:40.084
IT DESPITE EXPENDITURES OF

00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:42.186
LARGE SUMS OF MONEY AND A PART

00:38:42.253 --> 00:38:43.754
OF THE REASON IS WE HAVE NOT

00:38:43.821 --> 00:38:45.923
HAD THE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY TO

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:48.292
DO IT WHY IS DIGITAL SO

00:38:48.359 --> 00:38:50.361
ESSENTIAL WHY IS THAT ESSENTIAL

00:38:50.428 --> 00:38:52.196
THAT EVERY CHILD HAVE BROADBAND

00:38:52.263 --> 00:38:54.465
ACCESS. KIDS TODAY CAN'T DO

00:38:54.532 --> 00:38:56.033
THEIR HOMEWORK WITHOUT THAT TO

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.935
WE SEE CHILDREN SITTING OUTSIDE

00:38:58.002 --> 00:39:00.671
SCHOOLS AND OUTSIDE STARBUCKS

00:39:00.738 --> 00:39:01.372
SO THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO GET

00:39:01.439 --> 00:39:03.674
ONLINE. USING DIGITAL

00:39:03.741 --> 00:39:05.376
TECHNOLOGY WE CAN DO MORE THAN

00:39:05.443 --> 00:39:07.011
JUST CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP

00:39:07.078 --> 00:39:08.946
WE CAN ACCELERATE AND THEN RICH

00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:11.115
TREATMENT BECAUSE IT GIVES US

00:39:11.182 --> 00:39:13.984
THE OPTION. OF HAVING CHILDREN

00:39:14.051 --> 00:39:16.787
LEARN IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS WE

00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:19.323
PERSONALIZE IT YOU CAN LEARN

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:21.959

00:39:22.026 --> 00:39:24.095
SOMETHING THAT IS MEANINGFUL TO

00:39:24.161 --> 00:39:25.696
YOU AND THAT PERHAPS A CAREER

00:39:25.763 --> 00:39:27.331
AREA THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN

00:39:27.398 --> 00:39:29.533
BECAUSE YOU CAN DO IT ONLINE.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:30.634
ONE FEATURING FRONT OF A

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:34.505
FOR EVERY CHILD IN THE CLASS

00:39:34.572 --> 00:39:36.574
BUT DIGITAL ALLOWS US TO DO IT

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.443
IT IS ALSO MUCH MORE ENGAGING

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:41.112
THAN ANY BOOK OR ANY PETER

00:39:41.178 --> 00:39:44.181
COULD EVER BE. BECAUSE IT

00:39:44.248 --> 00:39:46.417
RESPONDS THAT YOU ANSWER AND

00:39:46.484 --> 00:39:48.285
YOU GET FEEDBACK IMMEDIATELY

00:39:48.352 --> 00:39:49.754
THE TEACHER CAN'T GIVE FEEDBACK

00:39:51.889 --> 00:39:54.158

THE REASON IT'S A GOOD ONE IS.

01:16:58.013 --> 01:17:00.148
FIVE G. IS DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY

01:17:00.215 --> 01:17:02.517
FROM OTHER CELLULAR PLANS FIVE

01:17:02.584 --> 01:17:04.252
G. IS A TECHNOLOGICAL

01:17:04.319 --> 01:17:05.654
BREAKTHROUGH THIS IS A GREAT

01:17:05.721 --> 01:17:08.890
LEAP FORWARD I CAN'T WAIT TO

SEE SIX GB. THE WAY I

01:17:11.426 --> 01:17:13.128
UNDERSTAND IT IT MEETS THE SAME

01:17:13.195 --> 01:17:15.030
SAFETY STANDARDS IS EQUIPMENT

01:17:15.097 --> 01:17:16.732
USED IN CURRENT NETWORKS

01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:19.534
CORRECT YES SIR. ROGER THAT.

01:17:19.601 --> 01:17:24.406
AND THIS IS A UNIQUE SYSTEM

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:25.507
BECAUSE IT'S MADE UP OF

01:17:25.574 --> 01:17:28.577
HUNDREDS OF VERY SMALL ANTENNA

01:17:28.643 --> 01:17:30.579
THEY'RE IN A REYES TO MAXIMIZE

01:17:30.645 --> 01:17:33.215
SIGNALS AND THAT RESULTS IN

01:17:33.281 --> 01:17:35.884
VERY LOW RADIO WAVE EXPOSURE

01:17:35.951 --> 01:17:39.154
CALL BEING FOR ME IS THAT

01:17:39.221 --> 01:17:42.124
CORRECT. YES SIR. GOOD EXPOSURE

01:17:42.190 --> 01:17:43.325
LEVELS WOULD BE BELOW

01:17:43.392 --> 01:17:45.394
INTERNATIONAL SAFETY LIMITS

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:47.362
WHICH IS TWENTY FOUR POINT TWO

01:17:47.429 --> 01:17:51.366
FIVE GIGAHERTZ. AND ABOVE. IT

01:17:51.433 --> 01:17:52.768
THE WAY I UNDERSTAND THE

01:17:52.834 --> 01:17:54.136
INTERNATIONAL SAFETY LIMITS IS

01:17:54.202 --> 01:17:59.241
THERE. THERE MOST STRINGENT IS

01:17:59.307 --> 01:18:01.777
IN THE EUROPEAN UNION SO WE'RE

01:18:01.843 --> 01:18:04.046
BELOW THE EUROPEAN UNION THE

01:18:04.112 --> 01:18:05.747
WAY I UNDERSTAND IT FOR SAFETY

01:18:05.814 --> 01:18:07.616
IS THAT CORRECT WHAT I WOULD

01:18:07.682 --> 01:18:09.718
SAY THAT THAT THAT THE BILL

01:18:09.785 --> 01:18:11.987
CONFORMS TO THE FCC SAFETY

01:18:12.054 --> 01:18:13.488
STANDARDS WHICH ARE VERY STRICT

01:18:13.555 --> 01:18:16.858
YES ALL RIGHT ALSO FROM MY

01:18:16.925 --> 01:18:19.027
RESEARCH FIVE G. CANNOT

01:18:19.094 --> 01:18:21.296
PENETRATE WALLS MOST FIVE G.

01:18:21.363 --> 01:18:23.465
NOT ALL WANNA MAKE THAT VERY

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:25.767
CLEAR. COULD NOT PENETRATE

01:18:25.834 --> 01:18:28.537
GLASS SO CELLULAR FIVE G. IS

01:18:28.603 --> 01:18:30.539
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM WIFI

01:18:30.605 --> 01:18:32.374
WIFI GOES THROUGH WALLS AND GO

01:18:32.441 --> 01:18:34.276
THROUGH YOUR WHOLE HOUSE AND

01:18:34.342 --> 01:18:36.144
PEOPLE WILL. SIT ON OUR

01:18:36.211 --> 01:18:37.946
COMPUTERS WITH A WIFI RIGHT

01:18:38.013 --> 01:18:40.682
NEXT TO NOT EVEN THINKING TWICE

01:18:40.749 --> 01:18:44.152
ABOUT RF ENERGY. SO I FIND IT

01:18:44.219 --> 01:18:48.990
KIND OF IRONIC. SO MADAM CHAIR

01:18:49.057 --> 01:18:51.526
I SEEM TO BE ON THE RIGHT TRACK

01:18:51.593 --> 01:18:53.228
HERE AS FAR AS THE

01:18:53.295 --> 01:18:56.431
TECHNICALITIES SO I'M GOOD OKAY

01:18:56.498 --> 01:18:57.966
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR OF

01:18:58.033 --> 01:18:59.334
ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL DOES

01:18:59.401 --> 01:19:01.837
ANYONE ELSE YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:04.873
BORA HORMONE. THANK YOU SENATOR

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:07.609
FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- I THINK

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:08.910
FIVE G. IS GOING TO ABSOLUTELY

01:19:08.977 --> 01:19:10.979
TRANSFORM HOW WE CONNECT WITH

01:19:11.046 --> 01:19:12.647
EACH OTHER AND WE CAN'T EVEN

01:19:12.714 --> 01:19:15.417
IMAGINE. THE WORLD AS IT'S

01:19:15.484 --> 01:19:17.486
GOING TO BE IN TERMS OF

01:19:17.552 --> 01:19:19.287
CONNECTIVITY I DON'T THINK IF

01:19:19.354 --> 01:19:21.189
YOU WOULD HAVE ASKED US ALL TEN

01:19:21.256 --> 01:19:23.492
YEARS AGO MOVIES SITTING HERE

01:19:23.558 --> 01:19:24.526
WITH SMARTPHONES AND ALL THE

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:26.561
STUFF. YOU KNOW OR MAYBE TEN

01:19:26.628 --> 01:19:27.929
YEARS AGO FOR TWENTY YEARS AGO

01:19:27.996 --> 01:19:28.997
WHO WAS SITTING HERE WITH MY

01:19:29.064 --> 01:19:30.198
PHONE I DON'T THINK WE WOULD

01:19:30.265 --> 01:19:31.433
HAVE KNOWN THAT SO I THINK IT'S

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.201
REALLY IMPORTANT TO DO THAT.

01:19:33.268 --> 01:19:34.536
ONE OF THE THINGS I'M CONCERNED

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:36.471
ABOUT THE ALL MY CITIES OPPOSE

01:19:36.538 --> 01:19:38.340
YOUR BILL. AND YOU SAID YOU

01:19:38.406 --> 01:19:39.307
WERE ALREADY WORKING WITH THE

01:19:39.374 --> 01:19:40.175
LEAGUE OF CITIES AND MY

01:19:40.242 --> 01:19:41.810
UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THEIR

01:19:41.877 --> 01:19:43.745
OPPOSITION HAS TO DO WITH

01:19:43.812 --> 01:19:44.479
ACTUALLY THE DETAIL OF THE

01:19:44.546 --> 01:19:46.181
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. CURRENT

01:19:46.248 --> 01:19:47.949
FEDERAL LAW AND WHAT YOUR BILL

01:19:48.016 --> 01:19:49.317
IS PROPOSING WHICH IS UNDER

01:19:49.384 --> 01:19:50.752
CURRENT FEDERAL LAW CITIES

01:19:50.819 --> 01:19:52.320
DON'T HAVE TO PROPOSE A REMEDY

01:19:52.387 --> 01:19:54.623
IN YOUR BILL. REQUIRES THEM TO

01:19:54.689 --> 01:19:56.091
PROPOSE A REMEDY IS THAT

01:19:56.158 --> 01:19:59.294
CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT SO I

01:19:59.361 --> 01:20:00.729
HOPE WE CONTINUE TO DO IT YES

01:20:00.795 --> 01:20:02.230
SIR YOU'RE RIGHT I JUST WANNA

01:20:02.297 --> 01:20:06.835
MAKE SURE I'M TELLING. I. SPENT

01:20:06.902 --> 01:20:08.036
A LOT. WE'VE HAD A LOT OF

01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:08.670
CONVERSATIONS A LOT OF TRYING

01:20:08.737 --> 01:20:09.704
TO OUT THE EXACT OPPOSITION A

01:20:09.771 --> 01:20:11.973
HE SO I. IT'S IMPORTANT AS WE

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:13.074
AFFORD BECAUSE I HAVE THE

01:20:13.141 --> 01:20:13.675
PLEASURE OF SEEING THIS AND

01:20:13.742 --> 01:20:15.277
COMMUNICATION COMMAND AND ON

01:20:15.343 --> 01:20:18.747
THE FLOOR AGAIN- TO WORK OUT.

01:20:18.813 --> 01:20:20.215
WHAT HAPPENS OF THE CITY

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:21.116
DETERMINES THAT THERE'S NO

01:20:21.183 --> 01:20:23.952
REMEDY. AND TO THINK ABOUT WHAT

01:20:24.019 --> 01:20:25.654
IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME LINE

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:26.655
ESPECIALLY FOR VERY SMALL

01:20:26.721 --> 01:20:28.823
CITIES. TO BE ABLE TO COME UP

01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:30.025
WITH THAT REMEDY VERY SMALL

01:20:30.091 --> 01:20:31.326
CITIES I DON'T HAVE VERY SMALL

01:20:31.393 --> 01:20:32.494
CITIES MUCH MORE CITIES SIXTY

01:20:32.561 --> 01:20:33.695
TWO THOUSAND. THEY PROBABLY

01:20:33.762 --> 01:20:34.763
HAVE STUFF TO DO IN THE TIME

01:20:34.829 --> 01:20:36.464
FRAME IS BEING PROPOSED. I

01:20:36.531 --> 01:20:37.199
THINK SOME OF THE SMALLER

01:20:37.265 --> 01:20:38.800
CITIES WON'T. SO IF YOU COULD

01:20:38.867 --> 01:20:40.902
THINK ABOUT THAT. AND THE THIRD

01:20:40.969 --> 01:20:43.972
THING I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. IS I

01:20:44.039 --> 01:20:44.906
THINK AS THIS TECHNOLOGY

01:20:44.973 --> 01:20:47.142
CHANGES. IT IS VERY POSSIBLE

01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:48.343
THAT FEDERAL GUIDELINES CAN

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:50.078
CHANGE. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:20:50.145 --> 01:20:51.846
YOUR BILL SAYS ABOUT BECAUSE

01:20:51.913 --> 01:20:53.882
YOUR BILL IS BASICALLY SAYING.

01:20:53.949 --> 01:20:55.584
WE'RE GONNA DEFINE WHAT THE

01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:56.718
FEDERAL LAW MEANS FOR

01:20:56.785 --> 01:20:59.454
CALIFORNIA CORRECT. CORRECT SO

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:00.889
AS THAT FEDERAL LAW CHANGES WE

01:21:00.956 --> 01:21:02.524
DON'T TO BE STUCK WITH A LAW.

01:21:02.591 --> 01:21:04.059
THAT DOES NOT REFLECT OVER

01:21:04.125 --> 01:21:05.827
CONSTANTLY COMING BACK HERE TO

01:21:05.894 --> 01:21:07.562
RE EVALUATE WHAT IT IS. SO I

01:21:07.629 --> 01:21:08.430
DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE THOUGHTS

01:21:08.496 --> 01:21:10.131
ON IF FEDERAL LAW WERE TO

01:21:10.198 --> 01:21:12.934
CHANGE. AND FIVE MONTHS SIX

01:21:13.001 --> 01:21:14.569
MONTHS. WHAT WOULD THE IMPACT

01:21:14.636 --> 01:21:16.137
BE IN CALIFORNIA AND HOW WE CAN

01:21:16.204 --> 01:21:17.138
ACCOMMODATE AND THAT IN YOUR

01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:19.140
BILL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT

01:21:19.207 --> 01:21:19.841
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME

01:21:19.908 --> 01:21:22.544
UNFORTUNATELY- IF WE PUT

01:21:22.611 --> 01:21:24.379
SOMETHING IN STATUTE THAT

01:21:24.446 --> 01:21:26.414
ROLLED OVER EVERY FEDERAL-

01:21:26.481 --> 01:21:29.551
CHANGE THE CAME UP A BOARD-

01:21:29.618 --> 01:21:31.920
WITH IT IN IN FACT. THAT WOULD

01:21:31.987 --> 01:21:34.556
TAKE AWAY- DECISION MAKING- YOU

01:21:34.623 --> 01:21:36.291
KNOW FROM THIS BODY IN TERMS OF

01:21:36.358 --> 01:21:37.325
IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANTED

01:21:37.392 --> 01:21:39.828
GOING FORWARD SO. ESSENTIALLY

01:21:39.894 --> 01:21:41.363
IF THERE WAS A BIG CHANGE IN

01:21:41.429 --> 01:21:43.164
FEDERAL LAW THAT REALLY-

01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:46.134
INTERFERED- WITH WITH THE STATE

01:21:46.201 --> 01:21:46.968
LAW THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING

01:21:47.035 --> 01:21:48.503
THAT THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:51.039
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO- OPINED

01:21:51.106 --> 01:21:52.307
ON IT WOULD GO THROUGH A

01:21:52.374 --> 01:21:54.976
DIFFERENT- BILL BUT IT. MISTER

01:21:55.043 --> 01:21:56.311
REYES HAS ANOTHER COMMENT ON

01:21:56.378 --> 01:21:58.713
THAT WHICH IS YES YES THANK YOU

01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:00.415
ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT SENATOR DODD

01:22:00.482 --> 01:22:02.083

01:22:02.150 --> 01:22:07.589
INDUSTRY WOULD LIKE. TO SEE. IT

01:22:07.656 --> 01:22:08.456
BECAUSE IS THIS WITH FEDERAL

01:22:08.523 --> 01:22:10.292
LAW OVER TIME BUT- WITH RISK.

01:22:10.358 --> 01:22:10.959
ALLEGE COUNTS IS PUSH BACK

01:22:11.026 --> 01:22:12.627
EIGHT THAT AS A SEAT OF SAAB.

01:22:12.694 --> 01:22:13.695
FROM THE STATE TO THE FEDERAL

01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:15.430
GOVERNMENT. OKAY AND THEN MY

01:22:15.497 --> 01:22:16.898
LAST COLUMN IT WILL BE ABOUT

01:22:16.965 --> 01:22:18.366
THIS BECAUSE I DID SERVE ON THE

01:22:18.433 --> 01:22:20.168
LEAGUE OF CITIES- HOUSING

01:22:20.235 --> 01:22:20.969
COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC

01:22:21.036 --> 01:22:24.039
DEVELOPMENT- SUBCOMMITTEE.

01:22:24.105 --> 01:22:25.707
WHILE THE PREVIOUS BILL WAS

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:27.108
GOING TO THE LEGISLATURE SO I

01:22:27.175 --> 01:22:28.710
REMEMBER ALL THOSE LOVELY

01:22:28.777 --> 01:22:30.945

01:22:34.649 --> 01:22:37.252
AGAIN. I THINK ONE OF THE

01:22:37.319 --> 01:22:38.286
BIGGEST TRADE US WE NEED TO

01:22:38.353 --> 01:22:40.288
MAKE. IS IF WE'RE GOING TO ASK

01:22:40.355 --> 01:22:42.190
CITIES TO TAKE THE EXTRA STEP.

01:22:42.257 --> 01:22:44.292
AND PROVIDE A REMEDY. THEN

01:22:44.359 --> 01:22:45.126
THERE SHOULD BE A PUBLIC

01:22:45.193 --> 01:22:47.362
BENEFIT. THERE SHOULD BE YOU

01:22:47.429 --> 01:22:50.398

DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THEIR

01:22:57.238 --> 01:22:59.374
COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE MAYBE IT'S

01:22:59.441 --> 01:22:59.874
NOT PROFITABLE FOR THAT

01:22:59.941 --> 01:23:01.609
DISTRIBUTION. THAT WE'RE

01:23:01.676 --> 01:23:02.944

SPACES BECAUSE WE ARE PROVIDING

01:23:04.312 --> 01:23:05.780
A PUBLIC BENEFIT. I THINK THERE

01:23:05.847 --> 01:23:06.815
SHOULD BE A PUBLIC BENEFIT

01:23:06.881 --> 01:23:07.982

01:57:39.819 --> 01:57:41.521
IT ALLOWS PERSONAL MAPS TO

AND MANY OF THE BILLS HAVE BEEN

02:01:29.749 --> 02:01:31.050
INTRODUCED IS THE LACK OF

02:01:31.117 --> 02:01:32.752
ATTENTION IS BEING PAYS TO THE

02:01:32.818 --> 02:01:34.086
PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST CHALLENGED

WHO ARE BELOW FIFTY PERCENT. OF

02:01:41.060 --> 02:01:43.396
THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME- AND WE

02:01:43.462 --> 02:01:44.964
NEED TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO

02:01:45.031 --> 02:01:46.198
THOSE PEOPLE IF WE'RE GOING TO

02:01:46.265 --> 02:01:47.633
RESOLVE WHERE THE PROBLEM

02:01:47.700 --> 02:01:50.036
REALLY LIES- DOES STUDY THAT

02:01:50.102 --> 02:01:51.337
CAME OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:01:51.404 --> 02:01:53.039
HOUSING ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO.

02:01:53.105 --> 02:01:54.440
INDICATES THAT THE MIDDLE- THE

02:01:54.507 --> 02:01:56.042
MODERATE INCOME FOLKS IN ABOVE

02:01:56.108 --> 02:01:57.677
MODERATE INCOME BOOKS IS NOT

02:01:57.743 --> 02:01:58.878
WHERE THE PROBLEM IS THE

02:01:58.944 --> 02:02:00.012
PROBLEM IS THAT THE LOWEST

02:02:00.079 --> 02:02:01.380
INCOME. I ALSO WANT TO POINT

02:02:01.447 --> 02:02:03.749
OUT. A PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL

02:02:03.816 --> 02:02:04.950
IN TERMS OF THE KINDS OF

02:02:05.017 --> 02:02:06.385
NEIGHBORHOODS THAT DEVELOPERS

02:02:06.452 --> 02:02:08.020
AND OTHERS WILL GO INTO IN

02:02:08.087 --> 02:02:09.789
ORDER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT.

02:02:09.855 --> 02:02:10.923
AND IT IS THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS

02:02:10.990 --> 02:02:12.992
THAT ARE MORE LOW INCOME WITH-

02:02:13.059 --> 02:02:14.994
WITH THE HOUSEHOLDS OF COLOR

02:02:15.061 --> 02:02:16.362
WHO WHO HAVE ACHIEVED SOME OF

02:02:16.429 --> 02:02:18.130
THE AMERICAN DREAM- WITH

02:02:18.197 --> 02:02:20.232
HOMEOWNERSHIP- WILL BE A WILL

02:02:20.299 --> 02:02:22.768
BE. COERCED OR CAJOLED OR BOT

02:02:22.835 --> 02:02:24.470
OUT OF THOSE- AND FORCED TO

02:02:24.537 --> 02:02:26.172
MOVE TO PLACES WHERE THEY CAN

02:02:26.238 --> 02:02:28.240
NO LONGER AFFORD TO LIVE- AND

02:02:28.307 --> 02:02:29.575
SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:02:29.642 --> 02:02:30.676
THOSE PEOPLE ARE PROTECTED OR

02:02:30.743 --> 02:02:32.912
AT LEAST. ARE PROVIDED SOME-

02:02:32.978 --> 02:02:35.014
SOME PROTECTIONS AS THEY LEAVE

02:02:35.081 --> 02:02:37.083
LEAVE THOSE HOMES- WITH RENTAL

AND THINGS LIKE THAT- THE THIRD

02:02:40.619 --> 02:02:42.054
THING I WANT TO POINT OUT IS

02:02:42.121 --> 02:02:42.988
THE BILL DOES INCLUDE SOME

02:02:43.055 --> 02:02:45.224
PROTECTIONS- RELATIVE TO RENT

CONTROLLED OR RENT RESTRICTED

02:02:46.659 --> 02:02:48.394
PROPERTIES. THE PROBLEM IS THAT

02:02:48.461 --> 02:02:51.097
THOSE PROTECTIONS APPLY TO-

02:02:51.163 --> 02:02:52.431
RENTAL UNITS APARTMENTS

02:02:52.498 --> 02:02:54.400
ETCETERA IT DOES NOT APPLY TO

02:02:54.467 --> 02:02:55.501
SINGLE FAMILY HOMES COSTA

02:02:55.568 --> 02:02:58.070
HAWKINS- RENTAL ACT A RENTAL

02:02:58.137 --> 02:02:59.705
HOUSING ACT DOES NOT INCLUDE

02:02:59.772 --> 02:03:01.507
SMALL- SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND

02:03:01.574 --> 02:03:02.608
SO THE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE IN

02:03:02.675 --> 02:03:04.910
THE BILL. ACTUALLY DON'T EXIST-

02:03:04.977 --> 02:03:06.245

02:04:45.744 --> 02:04:46.812
FEEL AS THOUGH THAT THAT

02:04:46.879 --> 02:04:48.981

02:04:49.048 --> 02:04:50.549

02:04:50.616 --> 02:04:51.784
HOUSING CRISIS YOU HEARD FROM

THAT LIVE IN THESE COMMUNITIES

02:45:29.352 --> 02:45:31.821
THAT MAY BE DISPLACED. IT'S A

02:45:31.888 --> 02:45:33.690
REALLY GOOD QUESTION- IN IT'S

02:45:33.757 --> 02:45:34.357
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN VERY

02:45:34.424 --> 02:45:36.226
FOCUSED IN ON. IT IF IT'S

02:45:36.293 --> 02:45:37.127
ALRIGHT WITH THE CHAIR WOULD

02:45:37.193 --> 02:45:38.061
LIKE TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT OF

02:45:38.128 --> 02:45:39.262
TIME DO A DEP DIVE IT'S

02:45:39.329 --> 02:45:41.264
ALRIGHT MADAM CHAIR ABSOLUTELY

02:45:41.331 --> 02:45:42.866
IN ADDISON NUMBER RIVAS ON THAT

02:45:42.932 --> 02:45:44.868
ISSUE. SO THERE'S A LOT OF

02:45:44.934 --> 02:45:46.069
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE

02:45:46.136 --> 02:45:47.003
AND TALK ABOUT THE

02:45:47.070 --> 02:45:48.705
AFFORDABILITY AND THEN ALSO

02:45:48.772 --> 02:45:51.308
TALK ABOUT- GENTRIFICATION AS

02:45:51.374 --> 02:45:53.076
WELL THAT'S ALL RIGHT. SO FIRST

02:45:53.143 --> 02:45:53.710
AND FOREMOST ON THEIR

02:45:53.777 --> 02:45:55.045
AFFORDABLE DISCUSSION WE'VE

02:45:55.111 --> 02:45:55.445
HEARD A LOT ABOUT

02:45:55.512 --> 02:45:58.148
AFFORDABILITY- THERE IS A STUDY

02:45:58.214 --> 02:46:01.985
DONE ON EIGHTY USE IN THE EAST

02:46:02.052 --> 02:46:02.552
BAY IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY

02:46:02.619 --> 02:46:03.987
AREA. IN THE TYPICAL EIGHTY YOU

02:46:04.054 --> 02:46:06.489
IN THIS STUDY. IS RENTING AT

02:46:06.556 --> 02:46:09.025
ABOUT 62% OF THE AREA MEDIAN

02:46:09.092 --> 02:46:12.562
INCOME. NOW UNDER OUR TENANT

02:46:12.629 --> 02:46:14.130
PROTECTION BILL THAT WAS PASSED

02:46:14.197 --> 02:46:15.465
BY THE LEGISLATURE SIGNED BY

02:46:15.532 --> 02:46:16.966
THE GOVERNOR ALONG WITH THE

02:46:17.033 --> 02:46:19.302
OVER TWO BILLION WE COVER AT

02:46:19.369 --> 02:46:22.072
TENANTS LIVING IN RENTALS UP TO

02:46:22.138 --> 02:46:23.707
EIGHTY PERCENT. OF AREA MEDIAN

02:46:23.773 --> 02:46:25.775
INCOME. SO THE AVERAGE EIGHTY

02:46:25.842 --> 02:46:27.977
YOU IN THE EAST BAY IS RENTING

02:46:28.044 --> 02:46:29.979
AT ABOUT 62% OF THE AREA MEDIAN

02:46:30.046 --> 02:46:31.648
INCOME. THE REASON WHY I BRING

02:46:31.715 --> 02:46:33.450
THAT UP IS THESE EIGHTY USE

02:46:33.516 --> 02:46:34.584
WHICH WOULD BE VERY SIMILAR

02:46:34.651 --> 02:46:36.920
SIZE TO THESE DUPLEXES ARE MUCH

02:46:36.986 --> 02:46:39.055
MORE AFFORDABLE THAN WHAT WE

02:46:39.122 --> 02:46:40.156
WOULD SEE A TYPICAL MARKET

02:46:40.223 --> 02:46:42.625
RATE. APARTMENT LET ALONE A

02:46:42.692 --> 02:46:45.195
SINGLE FAMILY HOME- NUMBER TWO

02:46:45.261 --> 02:46:47.464
THERE'S A REASON WHY HABITAT

02:46:47.530 --> 02:46:49.699
FOR HUMANITY SUPPORTS THIS BILL.

02:46:49.766 --> 02:46:51.134
THERE'S A REASON WHY BRIDGE

02:46:51.201 --> 02:46:52.235
HOUSING ONE OF THE LARGEST

02:46:52.302 --> 02:46:53.703
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS

02:46:53.770 --> 02:46:55.739
IN THE STATE SUPPORTS THIS BILL

02:46:55.805 --> 02:46:58.274
IN PARTICULAR WE KNOW THAT

02:46:58.341 --> 02:47:00.377
HABITAT FOR HUMANITY WHO IS AN

02:47:00.443 --> 02:47:02.846
EXPERT ON WORKING ON SMALLER

02:47:02.912 --> 02:47:05.148
LOTS AND GETTING THE MOST FOR

02:47:05.215 --> 02:47:06.483
FAMILIES I WILL BE ABLE TO

02:47:06.549 --> 02:47:08.852
UTILIZE THIS BILL TO PROVIDE

02:47:08.918 --> 02:47:09.919
PROVIDE A FIRST TIME

02:47:09.986 --> 02:47:11.988
HOMEOWNERS. OPPORTUNITIES THAT

02:47:12.055 --> 02:47:13.623
THEY WOULD OTHERWISE NEVER BE

02:47:13.690 --> 02:47:15.759
ABLE TO EXPERIENCE. SO I THINK

02:47:15.825 --> 02:47:17.660
THAT'S CRITICAL ON THE TENANT

02:47:17.727 --> 02:47:19.396
PROTECTION ISSUES I LIKE TO BE

02:47:19.462 --> 02:47:21.030
A CLEAR UP SOME ISSUES ON

02:47:21.097 --> 02:47:23.032
TENURE PROTECTION. SO ON TENER

02:47:23.099 --> 02:47:25.135
PROTECTIONS TEN PROTECTIONS

02:47:25.201 --> 02:47:29.639
APPLY IN SB NINE. SO IT SB NINE

02:47:29.706 --> 02:47:32.375
WOULD PROTECT TENANTS. LIVING

02:47:32.442 --> 02:47:34.611
IN A SINGLE FAMILY HOME SO I'D

02:47:34.677 --> 02:47:37.280
LIKE TO TALK ABOUT- THE

02:47:37.347 --> 02:47:38.248
RESTRICTIONS IN REGARD TO

02:47:38.314 --> 02:47:39.949

02:47:40.016 --> 02:47:42.819
EMBEDDED IN THIS BILL- SB NINE

02:47:42.886 --> 02:47:45.188
NUMBER ONE RESPECTS LOCAL

02:47:45.255 --> 02:47:47.157
TENANT PROTECTION LAW. SO IF A

02:47:47.223 --> 02:47:49.025
CITY OR COUNTY HAS AN EVICTION

02:47:49.092 --> 02:47:51.628
LAW OR A MORATORIUM IN PLACE

02:47:51.694 --> 02:47:53.329
THAT IS STRICTER THAN WHAT THE

02:47:53.396 --> 02:47:55.298
CURRENT. STATUTE IS FOR THE

02:47:55.365 --> 02:47:58.902
STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT LOCAL

02:47:58.968 --> 02:48:00.770
LAW IS GRANDFATHERED IN. THIS

02:48:00.837 --> 02:48:02.872
BILL DOES NOT DISRUPT ANY

02:48:02.939 --> 02:48:04.874
ACTION THAT IS CITY COUNCIL

02:48:04.941 --> 02:48:05.442
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO MOVE

02:48:05.508 --> 02:48:09.479
FORWARD WITH. NOW IN THIS BILL

02:48:09.546 --> 02:48:11.181
THE LANGUAGE STATES IF A TENANT

02:48:11.247 --> 02:48:13.716
HAS RESIDED IN A SINGLE FAMILY

02:48:13.783 --> 02:48:16.486
HOME FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS

02:48:16.553 --> 02:48:17.053
YOU CAN'T MOVE FORWARD WITH

02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:19.889
DEMOLITION. OR TRANSITION OF

02:48:19.956 --> 02:48:21.758
THAT SINGLE FAMILY HOME TO A

02:48:21.825 --> 02:48:26.095
DUPLEX SO- THAT PROPERTY IS

02:48:26.162 --> 02:48:29.833
SIMPLY NOT ELIGIBLE. SO IF A

02:48:29.899 --> 02:48:31.634
TENANT HAS LIVED IN THE HOME.

02:48:31.701 --> 02:48:33.970
OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS YOU

02:48:34.037 --> 02:48:36.072
CAN'T TRANSITION AT HOME. THESE

02:48:36.139 --> 02:48:37.974
ARE INCREDIBLY STRICT STANDARDS

02:48:38.041 --> 02:48:39.976
THAT'S EMBEDDED WITHIN SB NINE

02:48:40.043 --> 02:48:42.912
AND REALLY STARTS- A REALLY

02:48:42.979 --> 02:48:44.314
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION IN THE

02:48:44.380 --> 02:48:45.849
STATE ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO

02:48:45.915 --> 02:48:47.484
STAND STRONG FOR TENANTS IN THE

02:48:47.550 --> 02:48:48.952
MILLIONS WHO ARE CALLING THE

02:48:49.018 --> 02:48:51.221
SINGLE FAMILY HOME DWELLINGS-

02:48:51.287 --> 02:48:53.590
HOME FOR THEIR FAMILIES. NOW

02:48:53.656 --> 02:48:57.193
THIS BILL ALSO HAS CHANGED

02:48:57.260 --> 02:48:57.760
SINCE THE LAST TIME I WAS IN

02:48:57.827 --> 02:48:59.963
FRONT OF YOU. WE'VE HEARD A LOT

02:49:00.029 --> 02:49:02.899
OF FEEDBACK THAT- TO AVOID

02:49:02.966 --> 02:49:06.503
SPECULATION. AVOID LARGE-

02:49:06.569 --> 02:49:08.304
PROFITEERING GROUPS COMING IN

02:49:08.371 --> 02:49:10.940
TO BETTER DEVELOP THESE LOTS

02:49:11.007 --> 02:49:12.175
THAT OWNERS SHOULD HAVE TO LIVE

02:49:12.242 --> 02:49:15.979
THERE. AND SO NOW IN SB NINE-

02:49:16.045 --> 02:49:18.214
IF A CITY COUNCIL OR BOARD OF

02:49:18.281 --> 02:49:20.450
SUPERVISORS WANTS TO PUT AN

02:49:20.517 --> 02:49:23.086
OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS ON

02:49:23.152 --> 02:49:25.188
TO A FOUR PLEX OR DUPLEX. THEY

02:49:25.255 --> 02:49:27.657
CAN DO THAT. UNDER ELEVEN

02:49:27.724 --> 02:49:28.424
TWENTY LAST YEAR THEY COULD

02:49:28.491 --> 02:49:30.827
NOT. IN THAT'S RESPONDING TO

02:49:30.894 --> 02:49:31.794
CONCERNS THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM

02:49:31.861 --> 02:49:33.429
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- IN

02:49:33.496 --> 02:49:35.164
NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS SO THAT IF

02:49:35.231 --> 02:49:37.467
I OWN AND I LIVE IN A COMMUNITY

02:49:37.534 --> 02:49:39.636
WHERE MY NEIGHBORHOOD IS BUILT

02:49:39.702 --> 02:49:41.538
IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE. AT THEIR

02:49:41.604 --> 02:49:43.606
CORE ADD VERY SMALL HOME OF

02:49:43.673 --> 02:49:44.207
NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SQUARE

02:49:44.274 --> 02:49:46.309
FEET LARGER LOTS OF QUARTER

02:49:46.376 --> 02:49:48.545
ACRE MOST OF THE HOMES IN MY

02:49:48.611 --> 02:49:50.747
NEIGHBORHOOD EITHER HAVE AN

02:49:50.813 --> 02:49:53.283
EIGHTY YOU OR A G. EIGHTY YOU

02:49:53.349 --> 02:49:55.552
AND INDEED YOU ALREADY ON IT-

02:49:55.618 --> 02:49:56.586
AND I THINK THAT'S THE OTHER

02:49:56.653 --> 02:49:58.154
PIECE I'D LIKE TO DESCRIBE.

02:49:58.221 --> 02:50:00.256
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF- TALK

02:50:00.323 --> 02:50:02.292
ABOUT HOW. HOMEOWNERS COULD

02:50:02.358 --> 02:50:04.561
DOUBLE DIP. IF YOU HAVE AN

02:50:04.627 --> 02:50:05.862
EIGHTY YOU A GT ON A SINGLE

02:50:05.929 --> 02:50:07.263
FAMILY HOME YOU CAN'T IT'S A

02:50:07.330 --> 02:50:09.766
MAXIMUM OF FOUR UNITS ON A LOT.

02:50:09.832 --> 02:50:12.402
THAT'S IT- NO I THINK I'D LIKE

02:50:12.468 --> 02:50:15.204
TO SAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER INTO THE

02:50:15.271 --> 02:50:16.973
CHAIR IF IT'S ALL RIGHT. IS THE

02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:19.075
ISSUE ISSUE OF GENTRIFICATION.

02:50:19.142 --> 02:50:20.209
WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT OWNER

02:50:20.276 --> 02:50:21.678
OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS IS AN

02:50:21.744 --> 02:50:23.212
IMPORTANT ONE. TO BE ABLE TO

02:50:23.279 --> 02:50:25.548
AVOID GENTRIFICATION. BUT THIS

02:50:25.615 --> 02:50:27.417
BILL IS ALSO ABOUT

02:50:27.483 --> 02:50:29.619
INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH. AND I

02:50:29.686 --> 02:50:32.255
DON'T THINK WE CAN ASSUME. THAT

02:50:32.322 --> 02:50:34.123
IT'S ALL GOING TO BE PROFITEERS

02:50:34.190 --> 02:50:34.891
IT'S GONNA BE COMING INTO

02:50:34.958 --> 02:50:37.460
NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WILL BE

02:50:37.527 --> 02:50:39.262
SELLING OFF AND IN HOMEOWNER

02:50:39.329 --> 02:50:41.264
SELLING OFF THEIR HOMES I WILL

02:50:41.331 --> 02:50:41.965
GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE IN MY

02:50:42.031 --> 02:50:43.766
NEIGHBORHOOD. THE VAST MAJORITY

02:50:43.833 --> 02:50:45.568
OF THE HOMES THAT HAVE A GED

02:50:45.635 --> 02:50:48.938
YOU AN EIGHTY OR BOTH HAVE THE

02:50:49.005 --> 02:50:49.539

HOUSE. I AND WE SEE THAT HERE

02:50:51.874 --> 02:50:54.010
IN SACRAMENTO IS WELL. AND THAT

02:50:54.077 --> 02:50:55.578
BUILDS LONG TERM

02:50:55.645 --> 02:50:56.946
INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH FOR

02:50:57.013 --> 02:50:59.115
THOSE FAMILIES. AS YOU'RE ABLE

02:50:59.182 --> 02:51:00.416
TO BUILD THAT LAND VALUE UP

02:51:00.483 --> 02:51:01.317
WITH THOSE ADDITIONAL UNITS

02:51:01.384 --> 02:51:02.185
THAT ARE GOING TO BE MORE

02:51:02.251 --> 02:51:04.220
AFFORDABLE THAN WHAT THE ACTUAL

02:51:04.287 --> 02:51:06.789
MARKET RATE WOULD BE. SO SOME

02:51:06.856 --> 02:51:08.191

THE HIGH FIRE. ANA AREA AND

02:53:49.719 --> 02:53:50.920
THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT

02:53:50.987 --> 02:53:53.222
THE INCREASING DENSITY THAT

02:53:53.289 --> 02:53:55.925
COULD BE HAPPENING WITH THIS-

02:53:55.992 --> 02:53:58.227
ONE QUESTION I WANT TO ASK IS A

02:53:58.294 --> 02:53:59.428
CITY OPTED IN FOR THE OWNER

02:53:59.495 --> 02:54:01.597
OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS. ONE OF

02:54:01.664 --> 02:54:02.565
THE CHALLENGES THAT I'VE HEARD

02:54:02.632 --> 02:54:06.068
FROM CONSTITUENTS IS THAT- THE

02:54:06.135 --> 02:54:07.737
ONLY PEOPLE THAT HAVE ACCESS TO

02:54:07.804 --> 02:54:09.572
THE CAPITAL ACTUALLY

02:54:09.639 --> 02:54:11.941
TRANSFORMING USE SB NINE WOULD

02:54:12.008 --> 02:54:13.810
BE THOSE WHO ALREADY ARE VERY

02:54:13.876 --> 02:54:16.546
AFFLUENT SO THE MIDDLE INCOME

02:54:16.612 --> 02:54:17.313
AREAS WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE

02:54:17.380 --> 02:54:19.148
ACCESS TO CAPITAL WOULD BE VERY

02:54:19.215 --> 02:54:20.483
HARD FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY

02:54:20.550 --> 02:54:22.819
IMPLEMENT THIS. IN A WAY THAT

02:54:22.885 --> 02:54:24.253
IS EQUITABLE DO YOU HAVE A

02:54:24.320 --> 02:54:26.389
COMMENT TO THE TO THAT ARE IN

02:54:26.455 --> 02:54:27.890
RESPONSE TO THAT QUESTION I

02:54:27.957 --> 02:54:30.026
THINK- I'LL TALK ABOUT EIGHTY

02:54:30.092 --> 02:54:31.260
USING DUPLEXES IN GENERAL IF

02:54:31.327 --> 02:54:32.762
IT'S ALRIGHT WITH YOU I THINK

02:54:32.829 --> 02:54:34.030
THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO FOCUS

02:54:34.096 --> 02:54:36.332
ON FINANCING OF EIGHTIES JD

02:54:36.399 --> 02:54:39.468
USE. THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT-

02:54:39.535 --> 02:54:42.238
VERY FOCUSED ON- AND I THINK

02:54:42.305 --> 02:54:44.040
THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO ADVANCE

02:54:44.106 --> 02:54:45.775
A FINANCING MECHANISM TO MAKE

02:54:45.842 --> 02:54:47.710
IT EASIER FOR MIDDLE INCOME

02:54:47.777 --> 02:54:49.512
HOMEOWNERS LOWER INCOME

02:54:49.579 --> 02:54:50.713
HOMEOWNERS TO BE ABLE TO

02:54:50.780 --> 02:54:56.085
ADVANCE BUT WHAT I'LL SAY IS

02:54:56.152 --> 02:54:57.320
THIS- RIGHT. NOW IN MANY OF

02:54:57.386 --> 02:54:59.088
THESE CITIES THEY WOULD ALLOW A

02:54:59.155 --> 02:55:00.389
SINGLE FAMILY HOME TO BE ABLE

02:55:00.456 --> 02:55:02.725
TO BE DEVELOPED. I BEHIND AT

02:55:02.792 --> 02:55:05.528
HOME THERE HAS NOT BEEN NEARLY

02:55:05.595 --> 02:55:09.565
AS MUCH- VOICE TO THAT ISSUE

02:55:09.632 --> 02:55:11.133
VERSUS BEING ABLE TO PUT A

02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:13.669
DUPLEX BEHIND HOME. IN WHAT WE

02:55:13.736 --> 02:55:17.073
KNOW IS BASED OFF OF THE STUDY

02:55:17.139 --> 02:55:19.375
THAT WE SAW IN THE EAST BAY- IS

02:55:19.442 --> 02:55:22.345
THAT THESE EIGHTY USE AND I'LL

02:55:22.411 --> 02:55:24.714
SAY DUPLEXES ARE GOING TO BE

02:55:24.780 --> 02:55:27.049
MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE. MUCH MORE

02:55:27.116 --> 02:55:28.784
AFFORDABLE THAN A RENTING OF A

02:55:28.851 --> 02:55:30.653
SECOND SINGLE FAMILY HOUSE ON A

02:55:30.720 --> 02:55:34.090
LOT. I BECAUSE OF THE SMALLER

02:55:34.156 --> 02:55:36.259
SQUARE FOOTAGE RIGHT- IN THE

02:55:36.325 --> 02:55:38.227
LACK OF THE YARD SO I DO THINK

02:55:38.294 --> 02:55:39.996
BY DESIGN THEY ARE GOING TO BE

02:55:40.062 --> 02:55:41.464
MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE. AND THAT

02:55:41.530 --> 02:55:43.099
THE ONE OTHER PIECE OF SAY

02:55:43.165 --> 02:55:43.900
ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I DON'T

02:55:43.966 --> 02:55:45.034
MEAN TO MINIMIZE THE TIME YOU

02:55:45.101 --> 02:55:46.702
KNOW I STOP IN THIRTY SECONDS I

02:55:46.769 --> 02:55:48.738
HAVE THREE MORE QUESTIONS OKAY-

02:55:48.804 --> 02:55:50.539
IS THAT- IT'S ALL EYES WILL BE

02:55:50.606 --> 02:55:53.309
CLEAR TO IS THAT- FLOOR AREA

02:55:53.376 --> 02:55:56.879
RATIO. AT SET BACK AS WELL AS

02:55:56.946 --> 02:55:59.882
HIGH ARE NOT AT THIS BILL DOES

02:55:59.949 --> 02:56:01.117
NOT OVERRIDE ANY OF THOSE THREE

02:56:01.183 --> 02:56:02.752
ISSUES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN

02:56:02.818 --> 02:56:04.820
ALSO CONTINUE TO APPLY SET

02:56:04.887 --> 02:56:07.590
BACKS FLORI RATIO AND HIGH. I

02:56:07.657 --> 02:56:09.759
TO THESE UNITS. I'M SORRY THAT

02:56:09.825 --> 02:56:10.660
ONE OF SOME NO THAT'S OKAY

02:56:10.726 --> 02:56:11.727
BECAUSE THAT LEADS INTO MY NEXT

02:56:11.794 --> 02:56:14.630
QUESTION SO WHEN WE DID THE

02:56:14.697 --> 02:56:16.198
INCREASE IN DENSITY AND ANTHONY

02:56:16.265 --> 02:56:17.867
THIS WE PUT A MAXIMUM AVERAGE

02:56:17.934 --> 02:56:20.136
SIZE. ON THE UNITS AS THEIR

02:56:20.202 --> 02:56:22.204
MAXIMUM AVERAGE SIZE THOUGH

02:56:22.271 --> 02:56:23.306
WHAT HAPPENS IN MY AREAS THEY

02:56:23.372 --> 02:56:26.075
WOULD BUILD LARGER TWO THOUSAND

02:56:26.142 --> 02:56:26.642
THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT

02:56:26.709 --> 02:56:28.210
MCMANSIONS WHICH WE KNOW BY

02:56:28.277 --> 02:56:29.979
THAT SIZE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

02:56:30.046 --> 02:56:31.380
BE AFFORDABLE AND ANYWAY IT'S

02:56:31.447 --> 02:56:32.315
NOT LIKE YOU TAKE A TWO MILLION

02:56:32.381 --> 02:56:34.083
DOLLAR HOME. DIVIDED FOR EACH

02:56:34.150 --> 02:56:36.719
COST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND YOU

02:56:36.786 --> 02:56:37.486
TAKE A TWO MILLION DOLLAR HOMES

02:56:37.553 --> 02:56:39.255
BUT IN THE FOR EACH ONE COSTS

02:56:39.322 --> 02:56:40.890
ONE POINT TWO ONE POINT FIVE

02:56:40.957 --> 02:56:42.591
MILLION RIGHT SO IS THERE A

02:56:42.658 --> 02:56:45.561
MAXIM AVERAGE SIZE THAT THAT

02:56:45.628 --> 02:56:46.796
SIZE ITSELF IN. LEAD TO MORE

02:56:46.862 --> 02:56:49.865
NATURAL AFFORDABILITY. THERE IS

02:56:49.932 --> 02:56:51.968
NO MAXIMUM SIZE BUT WHAT I'LL

02:56:52.034 --> 02:56:53.769
SAY IS THAT YOU COULD DEVELOP

02:56:53.836 --> 02:56:55.037
ON A TWELVE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT

02:56:55.104 --> 02:56:57.974
BUILDING- THE MINIMUM IS

02:56:58.040 --> 02:56:59.342
DEVELOPING A TWELVE HUNDRED

02:56:59.408 --> 02:57:01.677
SQUARE FOOT BUILDING PARCEL- SO

02:57:01.744 --> 02:57:03.212
THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO GET YOU

02:57:03.279 --> 02:57:05.214
TO IT SIX HUNDRED SQUARE FEET-

02:57:05.281 --> 02:57:07.483
BUT- THERE THERE IS NOT A

02:57:07.550 --> 02:57:10.119
MAXIMUM I SIZE ON THIS AT THIS

02:57:10.186 --> 02:57:12.822
TIME MMHM. AND THEN MY NEXT

02:57:12.888 --> 02:57:16.025
QUESTION GOES TO RENO- AND MOST

02:57:16.092 --> 02:57:18.060
OF MY CITIES OUR ISSUE IS NOT

02:57:18.127 --> 02:57:19.362
MODERATE OR ABOVE MODERATE

02:57:19.428 --> 02:57:21.998
HOUSING IT IS ACTUALLY THE LOW

02:57:22.064 --> 02:57:24.200
AND VERY LOW INCOME HOUSING AND

02:57:24.266 --> 02:57:25.334
IF YOU TAKE A SINGLE FAMILY

02:57:25.401 --> 02:57:27.370
HOME AND YOU DIVIDE IT WHAT'S

02:57:27.436 --> 02:57:29.238
THE RENO CREDIT THAT CITIES

02:57:29.305 --> 02:57:32.742
WOULD GET THROUGH SB NINE. FOR

02:57:32.808 --> 02:57:34.210
ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING. YEAH I

02:57:34.276 --> 02:57:35.811
MEAN I THINK RIGHT NOW THAT

02:57:35.878 --> 02:57:38.314
THESE WOULD BE CONSIDERED.

02:57:38.381 --> 02:57:39.849
MARKET RATE RENTALS BUT AT THE

02:57:39.915 --> 02:57:42.551
SAME TIME THOUGH WE KNOW THAT

02:57:42.618 --> 02:57:44.020
BASED OFF THE STUDY IN THE EAST

02:57:44.086 --> 02:57:46.655
BAY THAT THE EASY TO USE SO

02:57:46.722 --> 02:57:47.623
EIGHTY USER PROBABLY ANYWHERE

02:57:47.690 --> 02:57:51.027
BETWEEN- FOUR HUNDRED AND

02:57:51.093 --> 02:57:51.794
FIFTEEN SEVEN HUNDRED SQUARE

02:57:51.861 --> 02:57:52.762
FEET THEY'RE RENTING IT SIXTY

02:57:52.828 --> 02:57:55.431
TWO PERCENT. OF THE MEDIAN SO

02:57:55.498 --> 02:57:56.599
THAT THEY ARE MUCH MORE

02:57:56.665 --> 02:57:57.833
AFFORDABLE BUT I THINK THE

02:57:57.900 --> 02:57:59.802
OTHER PIECES- JUST WANT TO

02:57:59.869 --> 02:58:02.038
MENTION IS THAT SB NINE IS PART

02:58:02.104 --> 02:58:03.606
OF A LARGER PACKAGE THAT WE'RE

02:58:03.672 --> 02:58:05.241
FOCUSING ON. BUT THERE IS NOT

02:58:05.307 --> 02:58:06.609
GONNA BE A SILVER BULLET TO BE

02:58:06.675 --> 02:58:07.443
ABLE TO SOLVE THIS AFFORDABLE

02:58:07.510 --> 02:58:09.378
HOUSING CRISIS. AND THAT'S WHY

02:58:09.445 --> 02:58:10.780
THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR'S

02:58:10.846 --> 02:58:12.381
LOOKING AT AN EIGHT BILLION

02:58:12.448 --> 02:58:13.816
DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN HOMELESS

02:58:13.883 --> 02:58:15.951
HOUSING THAT'S WHY WE'RE

02:58:16.018 --> 02:58:17.319
WORKING THE SENATE WILL BE

02:58:17.386 --> 02:58:18.654
ADVANCING IN THIS PACKAGE LED

02:58:18.721 --> 02:58:20.656
BY TONI ATKINS. ON THE SIX

02:58:20.723 --> 02:58:21.524
POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR

02:58:21.590 --> 02:58:23.459
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BOND WHICH

02:58:23.526 --> 02:58:25.327
WE SO DESPERATELY NEED THERE'S

02:58:25.394 --> 02:58:26.662
GONNA BE NEARLY TWO BILLION IN

02:58:26.729 --> 02:58:27.930
THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. FOR

02:58:27.997 --> 02:58:29.331
ADDITIONAL FOR DOUBLE HOUSING

02:58:29.398 --> 02:58:31.033
AND THAT EIGHTY YOU FINANCING

02:58:31.100 --> 02:58:33.202
THAT I MENTIONED. THANKS TO THE

02:58:33.269 --> 02:58:34.904
LEADERSHIP OF YOUR BUDGET SUB

02:58:34.970 --> 02:58:36.772
AND IN FACT CENTER CABALLERO IS

02:58:36.839 --> 02:58:39.475
HERE AND IS WELL THERE IS RIGHT

02:58:39.542 --> 02:58:41.577
NOW- THE POTENTIAL TO HAVE A DO

02:58:41.644 --> 02:58:42.845
YOU FINANCING IN THE BUDGET

02:58:42.912 --> 02:58:44.313
APPROVED OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GONNA

02:58:44.380 --> 02:58:45.281
NEED THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT

02:58:45.347 --> 02:58:47.083
ON THAT. WHICH WOULD USHER IN

02:58:47.149 --> 02:58:49.752
ADDITIONAL AFFORDABLE UNITS-

02:58:49.819 --> 02:58:52.088
BUT- NOW CITIES COULD DO SOME

02:58:52.154 --> 02:58:53.756
TYPE OF DEED RESTRICTION RIGHT

02:58:53.823 --> 02:58:57.393
THAT. WOULD THEN MAKE IT

02:58:57.460 --> 02:58:57.993
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO CITIES

02:58:58.060 --> 02:58:59.562
COULD BE. THE EXTRA HOMES

02:58:59.628 --> 02:59:02.331
DEVELOPED UNDER SB NINE TO BE.

02:59:02.398 --> 02:59:04.834
DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE AND

02:59:04.900 --> 02:59:07.870
80% AB AMYRA BELOW. THE BUT

02:59:07.937 --> 02:59:08.838
THEY POTENTIALLY COULD. YES

02:59:08.904 --> 02:59:11.407
MMHM- AND THE LAST QUESTION AND

02:59:11.474 --> 02:59:12.775
YOU YOU KIND OF TOUCHED ON IT

02:59:12.842 --> 02:59:14.810
SO. YOU SAID THAT THERE IS A

02:59:14.877 --> 02:59:16.745
MAXIMUM NUMBER OF FOUR UNITS

02:59:16.812 --> 02:59:17.646
THAT COULD BE CONVEYED

02:59:17.713 --> 02:59:21.283
SEPARATELY AFTER A YEAR. RIGHT

02:59:21.350 --> 02:59:23.619
WHAT.WHAT COVERAGES ARE

02:59:23.686 --> 02:59:26.021
INCLUDED IN SB NINE. THAT WOULD

02:59:26.088 --> 02:59:28.824
PRECLUDE. THEM FROM ACTUALLY

02:59:28.891 --> 02:59:30.526
BUILDING A JDO IN EIGHTY

02:59:30.593 --> 02:59:32.828
BECAUSE AFTER THAT POINT

02:59:32.895 --> 02:59:33.395
THEY'RE STILL SINGLE FAMILY

02:59:33.462 --> 02:59:34.363
HOME. SO THEY CAN STILL HAVE

02:59:34.430 --> 02:59:36.398
THAT START ON THE MECHANISM AS

02:59:36.465 --> 02:59:38.000
BENIGN THAT THAT HOW YOU LIMIT

02:59:38.067 --> 02:59:39.602
THAT WHEN ONCE YOU'RE YOU'RE

02:59:39.668 --> 02:59:40.136
OUT AND THEN THEY'RE BEING

02:59:40.202 --> 02:59:42.271
CONVEYED SEPARATELY. YES MA'AM-

02:59:42.338 --> 02:59:45.608
SO. TWO THINGS ONE. THAT THE

02:59:45.674 --> 02:59:46.709
HOMEOWNER IS GOING TO WHEN THEY

02:59:46.775 --> 02:59:48.010
PULL THEIR PERMIT WITHIN THEIR

02:59:48.077 --> 02:59:48.978
JURISDICTION WHETHER IT'S A

02:59:49.044 --> 02:59:50.279
CITY OR COUNTY THEY'RE GOING TO

02:59:50.346 --> 02:59:51.113
HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SAY WITHIN

02:59:51.180 --> 02:59:53.349
THEIR PERMIT. ON WHAT THEY'RE

02:59:53.415 --> 02:59:54.450
GONNA PLACE ON A LOT WHETHER

02:59:54.517 --> 02:59:56.685
IT'S A SINGLE FAMILY HOME HGTV

02:59:56.752 --> 02:59:58.420
EIGHTY OR DUPLEX NUMBER TWO

02:59:58.487 --> 02:59:59.688
THERE'S ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS

02:59:59.755 --> 03:00:00.322
BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO

03:00:00.389 --> 03:00:02.091
DISCLOSE HOW MANY WATER AND

03:00:02.158 --> 03:00:04.226
SEWER HOOK UPS. AND ELECTRICAL

03:00:04.293 --> 03:00:05.261
HOOKUPS THAT THEY HAVE ON THOSE

03:00:05.327 --> 03:00:07.897
UNITS AND SO I'M NOT AT ALL

03:00:07.963 --> 03:00:09.632
TRYING TO PASS THE BUCK BUT

03:00:09.698 --> 03:00:10.933
THIS AGAIN IS PART OF THE LOCAL

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.135
CONTROL THAT LOCAL CITY OR

03:00:13.202 --> 03:00:14.170
COUNTY THAT WOULD BE APPROVING

03:00:14.236 --> 03:00:16.238
THIS DEVELOPMENT. WILL KNOW

03:00:16.305 --> 03:00:18.374
WHAT TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT- WOULD

03:00:18.440 --> 03:00:19.608
BE PUT ON THERE WHETHER IT'S A

03:00:19.675 --> 03:00:22.211
G. D. U. EIGHTY OR DUPLEX-

03:00:22.278 --> 03:00:24.647
BASED OFF OF ONE THEIR ACTUAL

03:00:24.713 --> 03:00:25.548
BURNING BUILDING PERMIT FOR THE

03:00:25.614 --> 03:00:27.683
UNITS. AND THROUGH THE HOOK UPS

03:00:27.750 --> 03:00:28.584
THAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO

03:00:28.651 --> 03:00:29.418
APPLY FOR THROUGH THE LOCAL

03:00:29.485 --> 03:00:32.888
WATER DISTRICT WITH THE CITY OR

03:00:32.955 --> 03:00:35.524
THE COUNTY. ARE THERE ANY OTHER

03:00:35.591 --> 03:00:37.660
QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. YES

03:00:37.726 --> 03:00:41.263

WHAT BROUGHT THIS TO MY

03:29:11.906 --> 03:29:13.374
DISTRICT'S RESPONSIBILITY TO

03:29:18.512 --> 03:29:20.180

MUNICIPALITIES WATER DISTRICTS

03:29:27.988 --> 03:29:30.424
