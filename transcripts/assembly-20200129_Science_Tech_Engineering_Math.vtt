MADE- CALIFORNIA ON THE GLOBAL

00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:58.123
LEADER IN STEM BUT STEM IS

00:25:58.189 --> 00:25:59.991
EVERYWHERE IN OUR STATE IT'S

00:26:00.058 --> 00:26:02.560

00:32:59.444 --> 00:33:01.079
KEEPER CENTER WERE LOCATED IN

00:33:01.145 --> 00:33:02.313
OAKLAND CALIFORNIA THE HEART OF

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.482
SILICON VALLEY- AND HAS THE

00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:06.718
ASSEMBLY WOMAN JUST MENTIONED-

00:33:06.784 --> 00:33:07.752
WE KNOW THAT THE TECH SECTORS

00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:09.387
PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC

00:33:09.454 --> 00:33:10.355
OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS

00:33:10.421 --> 00:33:12.690
IN OUR STATE- HOWEVER THE MOST

00:33:12.757 --> 00:33:13.691
MARGINALIZED GROUPS

00:33:13.758 --> 00:33:14.826
SPECIFICALLY COMMUNITIES OF

00:33:14.892 --> 00:33:15.860
COLOR ARE FALLING FURTHER

00:33:15.927 --> 00:33:17.428
BEHIND I'M AND WE SEE IT

00:33:17.495 --> 00:33:19.564
ECONOMIC INEQUALITY INCREASING.

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:20.298
SO OUR MISSION AT THE KEEPER

00:33:20.365 --> 00:33:22.200
CENTERS TO FOCUS ON- INCREASING

00:33:22.266 --> 00:33:23.768
DIVERSITY INCLUSION ACROSS THE

00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:25.870
TECH ECO SYSTEM SO I ONE OF THE

00:33:25.937 --> 00:33:27.038
THINGS THAT MY TEAM AND I DO

00:33:27.105 --> 00:33:28.673
OUR CONDUCT CONDUCT RESEARCH

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.308
ON- ACCESS AND EQUITY IN

00:33:30.375 --> 00:33:31.843
COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION SO

00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:33.644
TODAY I'D LIKE TO SHARE A FEW

00:33:33.711 --> 00:33:34.779
COMMENTS ABOUT THE CURRENT

00:33:34.846 --> 00:33:35.813
LANDSCAPE SOME OF THE DATA

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:36.347
POINTS THAT YOU MENTIONED

00:33:36.414 --> 00:33:38.483
EARLIER- WHY IT MATTERS FOR

00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:41.052
STATE AND THE OPPORTUNITY THAT

00:33:41.119 --> 00:33:41.652
I THINK WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US

00:33:41.719 --> 00:33:44.188
TODAY. SEC WELL. I HAVE JUST A

00:33:44.255 --> 00:33:46.791
FEW SLIDES OF DATA HERE- SO WE

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:48.893
PUBLISHED A REPORT IN JUNE OF

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:49.861
TWENTY NINETEEN LOOKING UP FIVE

00:33:49.927 --> 00:33:50.661
YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL COMPUTER

00:33:50.728 --> 00:33:52.830
SCIENCE. ACCESS ENROLLMENT IN

00:33:52.897 --> 00:33:55.099
EQUITY DATA- AND THE FINDINGS

00:33:55.166 --> 00:33:56.401
WERE CONCERNING TO US FOR A

00:33:56.467 --> 00:33:58.403
NUMBER OF REASONS- FIRST WE

00:33:58.469 --> 00:34:01.739
FOUND THAT- JUST 39% OF ALL

00:34:01.806 --> 00:34:02.607
HIGH SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA

00:34:02.673 --> 00:34:04.475
OFFERED. ANY COMPUTER SCIENCE

00:34:04.542 --> 00:34:05.910
COURSE AND THAT NUMBER IS MUCH

00:34:05.977 --> 00:34:07.078
LOWER FOR THE ADVANCED

00:34:07.145 --> 00:34:07.945
PLACEMENT COMPUTER SCIENCE

00:34:08.012 --> 00:34:10.181
COURSES. ONLY ABOUT 14% OF ALL

00:34:10.248 --> 00:34:12.216
HIGH SCHOOLS- AND WE SEE BY

00:34:12.283 --> 00:34:14.352
THIS THE DARKER SHADES OF-

00:34:14.419 --> 00:34:17.021
COUNTIES THAT COMPUTER SCIENCE

00:34:17.088 --> 00:34:19.190
COURSES ARE. MOST LIKELY TO BE

00:34:19.257 --> 00:34:20.625
CONCENTRATED IN THE BAY AREA IN

00:34:20.691 --> 00:34:22.193
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND WE

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:23.728
FOUND THAT RURAL SCHOOLS ARE

00:34:23.795 --> 00:34:25.730
SEVEN TIMES LESS LIKELY TO HAVE

00:34:25.797 --> 00:34:26.264
ACCESS TO COMPUTER SCIENCE

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:30.902
COURSES. IN TERMS OF ACCESS BY

00:34:30.968 --> 00:34:32.937
SCHOOL DEMOGRAPHICS- WE FOUND

00:34:33.004 --> 00:34:33.971
THAT LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND

00:34:34.038 --> 00:34:35.006
STUDENTS OF COLOR HAVE

00:34:35.072 --> 00:34:36.541
SIGNIFICANTLY LESS-

00:34:36.607 --> 00:34:38.209
OPPORTUNITIES TO TAKE OR

00:34:38.276 --> 00:34:39.710
PARTICIPATING COMPUTER SCIENCE

00:34:39.777 --> 00:34:40.745
COURSES JUST BECAUSE THE

00:34:40.812 --> 00:34:42.013
COURSES ARE NOT OFFERED AFTER

00:34:42.079 --> 00:34:44.081
SCHOOL THAT THE SAME RATES. SO

00:34:44.148 --> 00:34:45.016
SCHOOL THAT ARE PREDOMINATELY

00:34:45.082 --> 00:34:47.351
STUDENTS OF COLOR- ART TWO

00:34:47.418 --> 00:34:49.687
TIMES LESS LIKELY TO OFFER- ANY

00:34:49.754 --> 00:34:51.355
COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSE AND LOW

00:34:51.422 --> 00:34:52.857
INCOME SCHOOLS ARE FOUR TIMES

00:34:52.924 --> 00:34:55.159
LESS LIKELY TO OFFER ADVANCED

00:34:55.226 --> 00:34:59.831
PLACEMENT COMPUTER SCIENCE A.

00:34:59.897 --> 00:35:01.199
THIS THAT WAS JUST MENTIONED

00:35:01.265 --> 00:35:02.467
EARLIER WHEN WE LOOK AT WHO

00:35:02.533 --> 00:35:03.501
ACTUALLY PARTICIPATES IN

00:35:03.568 --> 00:35:06.037
COMPUTER SCIENCE WE HAVE- OVER

00:35:06.103 --> 00:35:06.938
ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION HIGH

00:35:07.004 --> 00:35:09.040
SCHOOL STUDENTS AND ONLY 3% OF

00:35:09.106 --> 00:35:11.442
THEM ARE TAKING ANY CS COURSE-

00:35:11.509 --> 00:35:12.944
AND EVEN FEWER OF THEM ONLY ONE

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:14.412
PERCENT. ARE ENROLLED IN AP

00:35:14.479 --> 00:35:16.147
COMPUTER SCIENCE AND I REALIZE

00:35:16.214 --> 00:35:17.482
THAT THE GRAPH ON THE RIGHT IS

00:35:17.548 --> 00:35:19.383
ACTUALLY PRETTY SMALL SO I'M

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:20.151
GONNA TALK ABOUT A FEW OF THE

00:35:20.218 --> 00:35:22.119
DATA POINTS THERE- WHEN WE LOOK

00:35:22.186 --> 00:35:23.654
AT CS ENROLLMENT BY RACE AND

00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:26.390
GENDER. I'M JUST SIX THOUSAND

00:35:26.457 --> 00:35:28.392
OF OUR ONE MILLION LET NEXT

00:35:28.459 --> 00:35:29.293
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:32.497
TAKING- AP COMPUTER SCIENCE.

00:35:32.563 --> 00:35:33.531
THE NUMBER THE LOWER FOR BLACK

00:35:33.598 --> 00:35:35.600
STUDENTS WHERE JUST FIVE

00:35:35.666 --> 00:35:38.002
HUNDRED OF OUR- HUNDRED AND TEN

00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:39.136
THOUSAND BLACK STUDENTS ARE

00:35:39.203 --> 00:35:40.037
TAKING COMPUTER SCIENCE AP

00:35:40.104 --> 00:35:41.539
COMPUTER SCIENCE. AND FEMALE

00:35:41.606 --> 00:35:44.275
STUDENTS 27% ARE TAKING A PCS

00:35:44.342 --> 00:35:46.878
A- JUST THIRTY NINE BLACK GIRLS

00:35:46.944 --> 00:35:48.646
AND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:35:48.713 --> 00:35:50.114
THREE LIVE NEXT GIRLS TO

00:35:50.181 --> 00:35:52.517
COMPUTER SCIENCE AND- SO WHY

00:35:52.583 --> 00:35:52.984
ARE THESE FINDINGS SO

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:55.453
CONCERNING TO US- A COUPLE

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:56.988
REASONS ONE THAT COMPUTATIONAL

00:35:57.054 --> 00:35:58.222
THINKING AND KNOWLEDGE ARE

00:35:58.289 --> 00:35:59.390
BASICALLY TO RECEIVE THAT WE

00:35:59.457 --> 00:36:00.491
KNOW STUDETS WILL NEED ACROSS

00:36:00.558 --> 00:36:02.960
ALL FIELDS OF STUDY. I'M TO

00:36:03.027 --> 00:36:04.028
STUDENTS THAT ARE TAKING AP

00:36:04.095 --> 00:36:05.530
COMPUTER SCIENCE ARE MUCH MORE

00:36:05.596 --> 00:36:06.364
LIKELY TO GO ON A MAJOR IN

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:08.032
COMPUTER SCIENCE- AND BE

00:36:08.099 --> 00:36:10.167
PREPARED FOR- MAJORING IN

00:36:10.234 --> 00:36:12.203
COMPUTER SCIENCE AT BUT A POST

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:13.838
SECONDARY LEVEL. I'M AND THEN

00:36:13.905 --> 00:36:15.306
ALSO JUST AS A STATE CALIFORNIA

00:36:15.373 --> 00:36:16.440
NEEDS A DIVERSE AND ROBUST

00:36:16.507 --> 00:36:17.542
COMPUTING WORK FORCE OUR

00:36:17.608 --> 00:36:18.543
CURRENT TECH WORKFORCE IS

00:36:18.609 --> 00:36:20.344
OBVIOUSLY NOT REFLECTIVE OF OUR

00:36:20.411 --> 00:36:22.813
CURRENT STATE DEMOGRAPHICS-

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.516
AND- AS A- AGAIN OF THE STATE

00:36:25.583 --> 00:36:27.852
WHAT WE WILL BE REDUCE THING-

00:36:27.919 --> 00:36:29.120
INNOVATION AND EXACERBATING

00:36:29.186 --> 00:36:31.889
INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY OF

00:36:31.956 --> 00:36:32.456
FOR NOT ADDRESSING THIS KEY

00:36:32.523 --> 00:36:34.191
ISSUE. SO I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE

00:36:34.258 --> 00:36:35.960
HAVE IS AN OPPORTUNITY IN FRONT

00:36:36.027 --> 00:36:36.627
OF US DESPITE THIS DATA I

00:36:36.694 --> 00:36:38.529
THINK. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

00:36:38.596 --> 00:36:39.897
TO APPROACH THESE DISPARITIES

00:36:39.964 --> 00:36:41.699
IN COMPUTER SCIENCE- BY

00:36:41.766 --> 00:36:42.900
PRIORITIZING POLICIES AND

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:43.734
STRATEGIES THAT REALLY

00:36:43.801 --> 00:36:45.903
ADDRESSED THE- RACIAL GENDER

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:47.805
ECONOMIC AND GEOGRAPHIC GAPS

00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:49.907
THAT WE JUST ON THE DATA- I

00:36:49.974 --> 00:36:50.975
ALSO THINK WE HAVE THE

00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:51.943
OPPORTUNITY TO BE THOUGHTFUL

00:36:52.009 --> 00:36:53.878
AND STRATEGIC ABOUT ADDRESSING.

00:36:53.945 --> 00:36:56.347
THAT ENTRANCED I COULD NOT- THE

00:36:56.414 --> 00:36:57.748
EDGE ENTRANCED EDUCATIONAL

00:36:57.815 --> 00:36:59.517
INEQUALITY ACROSS ALL SUBJECT

00:36:59.584 --> 00:37:01.652
AREAS AT THE SAME TIME- SO WITH

00:37:01.719 --> 00:37:02.920
THAT I'D LIKE TO CONCLUDE BY

00:37:02.987 --> 00:37:03.721
SAYING I THINK WE CAN

00:37:03.788 --> 00:37:05.723
DEMONSTRATE BOLD LEADERSHIP- BY

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:07.158
ANSWERING ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE

00:37:07.224 --> 00:37:08.960
PREPARED FOR. A PARTICIPATION

00:37:09.026 --> 00:37:10.428
IN OUR FUTURE TACT OF AN

00:37:10.494 --> 00:37:11.796
ECONOMY. THANK YOU FOR THE

00:37:11.862 --> 00:37:14.165
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AGAIN I'M

00:37:14.231 --> 00:37:16.167
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

VERY EXCITED- TO TALK ABOUT

00:37:30.214 --> 00:37:31.048
DAVID DAVIS SOMETHING THAT'S

00:37:31.115 --> 00:37:32.283
VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO OUR HEART

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:35.019
ACROSS THE CODE- SO GROSS A

00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:35.753
CODE OR ANY YEAR OLD

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:38.089
ORGANIZATION- WE WERE FOUNDED

00:37:38.155 --> 00:37:39.023
WITH THE MISSION TO CLOSE THE

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:40.858
GENDER GA. IN ENTRY LEVEL

00:37:40.925 --> 00:37:42.927
TECHNOLOGY JOBS- WE DO THAT

00:37:42.994 --> 00:37:43.861
FIRST AND FOREMOST THROUGH OUR

00:37:43.928 --> 00:37:45.262
PROGRAMS WHERE WE NOTONLY

00:37:45.329 --> 00:37:46.864
TEACH GIRLS TO CODE- BUT WE

00:37:46.931 --> 00:37:47.832
GIVE THEM THE SKILLS TO

00:37:47.898 --> 00:37:48.666
CONFRONT A LOT OF THE CULTURAL

00:37:48.733 --> 00:37:50.034
STEREOTYPES BUT WHO AND WHAT.

00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:52.436
OCCURRED LOOKS LIKE- A FEW

00:37:52.503 --> 00:37:54.372
YEARS AGO YOU KNOW WE STARTED

00:37:54.438 --> 00:37:55.473
TO SEE THAT THERE IS THIS

00:37:55.539 --> 00:37:57.208
PROLIFERATION OF POLICIES

00:37:57.274 --> 00:37:58.743
DESIGNED TO EXPAND. COMPUTER

00:37:58.809 --> 00:38:01.045
SCIENCE IN SCHOOLS- WE REALIZE

00:38:01.112 --> 00:38:02.513
THAT TO REALLY FULFILL OUR

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.181
MISSION OF REACHING GENDER

00:38:04.248 --> 00:38:06.150
PARITY IN COMPUTER SCIENCE- WE

00:38:06.217 --> 00:38:07.585
NEEDED TO START ADDRESSING THE

00:38:07.652 --> 00:38:09.186
GENDER GAP IN IN. COMPUTER

00:38:09.253 --> 00:38:09.854
SCIENCE CLASSES WHAT WAS

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.389
HAPPENING IN SCHOOLS. FIRST

00:38:11.455 --> 00:38:12.923
THING WE DID WAS A WELL LET'S

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:14.125
LET'S LOOK AT THE DATA SURELY

00:38:14.191 --> 00:38:17.128
IT EXISTS- BUT THE TO OUR

00:38:17.194 --> 00:38:19.030
DISMAY WE REALIZE THAT THE ONLY

00:38:19.096 --> 00:38:20.031
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA THAT

00:38:20.097 --> 00:38:22.133
EXISTED WAS THROUGH THE COLLEGE

00:38:22.199 --> 00:38:24.268
BOARD'S AP PROGRAM- THROUGH

00:38:24.335 --> 00:38:25.870
PARTICIPATION. COMPUTER SCIENCE

00:38:25.936 --> 00:38:28.406
EXAMS- YOU KNOW WE LOOKED AT

00:38:28.472 --> 00:38:29.974
YOU KNOW IN CALIFORNIA FOR

00:38:30.041 --> 00:38:32.743
EXAMPLE. ALISON CHIP MENTIONED

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:34.545
SORT OF A WHAT WHAT IT LOOKS

00:38:34.612 --> 00:38:40.484
LIKE- BUT ALL OF ALL OF YOU

00:38:40.551 --> 00:38:41.585
TWENTY. THOUSAND BPD PERCENT

00:38:41.652 --> 00:38:42.687
EXAMS TAKE LASHER ONLY 30% OF

00:38:42.753 --> 00:38:43.320
THE WERE GIRL. AND ONLY 8% OF

00:38:43.387 --> 00:38:44.955
THE WERE ACROSS COLOR AGAIN I'M

00:38:45.022 --> 00:38:46.090
JUST GONNA AFTER THIS- ONLY

00:38:46.157 --> 00:38:46.991
FORTY NINE BLACK GIRLS AT THE

00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:48.259
AP COMPUTER SCIENCE EXAM ACROSS

00:38:48.325 --> 00:38:49.994
CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR. AND THAT

00:38:50.061 --> 00:38:51.662
DOESN'T INCLUDE ALL OF THE

00:38:51.729 --> 00:38:53.764
OTHER- COMPUTER SCIENCE IN

00:38:53.831 --> 00:38:54.865
COMPUTATIONAL THINKING COURSES

00:38:54.932 --> 00:38:56.467
THAT ARE BEING OFFERED ACROSS

00:38:56.534 --> 00:38:58.169
CALIFORNIA SO THIS IS THE ONLY

00:38:58.235 --> 00:38:59.737
PUBLIC DATA THAT EXISTS. ABOUT

00:38:59.804 --> 00:39:00.871
WHAT THE GAPS ARE NOT JUST FOR

00:39:00.938 --> 00:39:02.206
GENDER BUT FOR RACE FOR

00:39:02.273 --> 00:39:03.708
SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS FOR

00:39:03.774 --> 00:39:05.109
ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS. HOW

00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:05.876
WE DON'T HAVE A COMPLETE

00:39:05.943 --> 00:39:07.945
PICTURE OF. WHO'S TAKING

00:39:08.012 --> 00:39:08.879
COMPUTER SCIENCE TO THOSE

00:39:08.946 --> 00:39:10.014
CLASSROOMS LOOK LIKE THE

00:39:10.081 --> 00:39:12.850
SCHOOLS THAT THERE AND- AND IN

00:39:12.917 --> 00:39:15.152
POLICY BUT ESPECIALLY IN

00:39:15.219 --> 00:39:16.387
EDUCATION POLICY WHAT GETS

00:39:16.454 --> 00:39:18.322
MEASURED GETS MANAGED- IF

00:39:18.389 --> 00:39:19.990
THERE'S NO DATA ON GIRLS. OTHER

00:39:20.057 --> 00:39:21.492
UNDER REPRESENTED GROUPS IN

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:22.993
COMPUTER SCIENCE CLASSROOMS-

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:24.695
HOW ARE WE EVER TO KNOW IF

00:39:24.762 --> 00:39:26.163
THOSE COMPUTER SCIENCE

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:27.498
CLASSROOMS LOOK LIKE THE SCHOOL

00:39:27.565 --> 00:39:28.599
BRAND OR- THE COMMUNITIES

00:39:28.666 --> 00:39:31.135
THURMOND- HOW. WE TO TRULY

00:39:31.202 --> 00:39:33.137
EVALUATE THE POLICIES- THAT WE

00:39:33.204 --> 00:39:34.805
ENACTED TO PUT COMPUTER SCIENCE

00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:37.708
IN EVERY SCHOOL- AND HOW ARE WE

00:39:37.775 --> 00:39:39.009
SUPPOSED TO KNOW IF ARE WE NOT

00:39:39.076 --> 00:39:40.311
GETTING GIRLS IN THE FIRST

00:39:40.377 --> 00:39:41.912
PLACE ARE WE LOSING THEM

00:39:41.979 --> 00:39:42.913
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY HOW DO

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:43.914
WE REALLY MEASURE HOW WE'RE

00:39:43.981 --> 00:39:45.549
DOING IT NOT JUST SORT OF THE

00:39:45.616 --> 00:39:47.051
DIVERSITY ANGLE. BUT ALSO THE

00:39:47.118 --> 00:39:49.120
INCLUSION ANGLE- BECAUSE WHEN

00:39:49.186 --> 00:39:52.289
WE TALK ABOUT EQUITY- WE ARE SO

00:39:52.356 --> 00:39:52.890
OFTEN TALKING ABOUT DIVERSITY

00:39:52.957 --> 00:39:54.725
INCLUSION AND THEY OFTEN. YOU

00:39:54.792 --> 00:39:55.593
KNOW COME ACROSS IN THE SAME

00:39:55.659 --> 00:39:57.261
BREATH DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION-

00:39:57.328 --> 00:39:58.896
BUT WE FORGET THAT THEY'RE VERY

00:39:58.963 --> 00:40:00.631
DIFFERENT CONCEPTS- AND FOR

00:40:00.698 --> 00:40:02.299
DIVERT DIVERSITY IS SOMETHING

00:40:02.366 --> 00:40:03.601
THAT WE'RE GETTING MUCH BETTER

00:40:03.667 --> 00:40:04.869
AND COMPUTER SCIENCE- SO

00:40:04.935 --> 00:40:06.303
THAT'S- YOU KNOW GETTING GIRLS

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:08.139
AND OTHER UNDER REPRESENTED

00:40:08.205 --> 00:40:09.940
MINORITIES- EXPOSED TO COMPUTER

00:40:10.007 --> 00:40:11.242
SCIENCE SPARK THEIR INTEREST

00:40:11.308 --> 00:40:12.176
I'M GET THEM INTO THE

00:40:12.243 --> 00:40:13.444
CLASSROOMS AND CLUBS IN THE

00:40:13.511 --> 00:40:15.613
FIRST PLACE- BUT INCLUSION IS

00:40:15.679 --> 00:40:17.148
THE MUCH HARDER WORK- AND

00:40:17.214 --> 00:40:18.382
THAT'S THE WORK OF CREATING

00:40:18.449 --> 00:40:20.251
PERSISTENCE IN GIRLS TO PURSUE

00:40:20.317 --> 00:40:22.052
COMPUTER SCIENCE. IN HIGH

00:40:22.119 --> 00:40:23.420
SCHOOL AND COLLEGE AND AS A

00:40:23.487 --> 00:40:26.957
CAREER. I'M BUT ALL OF THIS

00:40:27.024 --> 00:40:29.660
REALLY START WITH DATA EIGHT.

00:40:29.727 --> 00:40:31.695
I'M IF WE CAN IDENTIFY WHERE

00:40:31.762 --> 00:40:33.831
THE GAPS ARE WITH A BIG. YOU

00:40:33.898 --> 00:40:40.204
KNOW WE'RE THEY PURPOSE STAYING.

00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:40.738
FOR WE DON'T KNOW OF GIRLS

00:40:40.805 --> 00:40:43.174
SPEAKING. AT AT ALL WE CAN TIME

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.576
SEEING. TO CLOSE THOSE GUYS. AN

00:40:45.643 --> 00:40:46.110
IT YOU KNOW YOU BE ASKING

00:40:46.177 --> 00:40:47.278
YOURSELF WHY. WHY EQUITY YOU

00:40:47.344 --> 00:40:47.845
KNOW WHY WE EVEN NEED TO BE

00:40:47.912 --> 00:40:48.379
TRACKING PARTICIPATE WORDS

00:40:48.445 --> 00:40:49.146
GOING PUT A COULD. SCIENCE AND

00:40:49.213 --> 00:40:50.414
EVERY SCHOOL IN THE GIRLS WILL

00:40:50.481 --> 00:40:53.684
COME- BUT IT YOU KNOW FOR US

00:40:53.751 --> 00:40:54.885
ACROSS THE CODE WE REALLY THINK

00:40:54.952 --> 00:40:56.754
ABOUT THIS SORT OF BEYOND JUST

00:40:56.821 --> 00:40:58.455
A YOU KNOW THIS EQUITY LINES WE

00:40:58.522 --> 00:40:59.723
THINK ABOUT THIS IN ECONOMIC

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:01.292
TERMS. AND WE THINK ABOUT THIS

00:41:01.358 --> 00:41:03.994
AND INNOVATION TERMS- IT FOR

00:41:04.061 --> 00:41:05.329
STARTERS WOMEN ARE THE PRIMARY

00:41:05.396 --> 00:41:06.730
BREAD WINNERS AND 40% OF

00:41:06.797 --> 00:41:08.732
AMERICAN FAMILIES- EVERYONE

00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:10.301
TALKS A LOT ABOUT HOW. YOU KNOW

00:41:10.367 --> 00:41:11.769
COMPUTER SCIENCE JOBS CODING

00:41:11.836 --> 00:41:13.871
JOBS PAID YOU KNOW THREE TIMES

00:41:13.938 --> 00:41:14.872
THE NATIONAL AVERAGE THERE SO

00:41:14.939 --> 00:41:17.575
MANY MORE OF THESE JOBS- AND

00:41:17.641 --> 00:41:18.943
FOR SO MANY FAMILIES AND FOR

00:41:19.009 --> 00:41:21.445
GIRLS- THESE ARE JOBS THAT ARE

00:41:21.512 --> 00:41:22.746
PATHWAYS INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS

00:41:22.813 --> 00:41:23.681
FOR THEIR FAMILIES IN THE NEXT

00:41:23.747 --> 00:41:25.583
GENERATION- SO THAT'S YOU KNOW

00:41:25.649 --> 00:41:27.218
A REALLY PRIMARY CONCERN BEHIND

00:41:27.284 --> 00:41:28.219
WHY WE NEED TO START TRACKING

00:41:28.285 --> 00:41:29.854
THIS DATA AND MAKING SURE THAT

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:30.421
OUR CLASSROOMS LOOK LIKE OUR

00:41:30.487 --> 00:41:33.157
COMMUNITIES- BUT I ALSO WANT US

00:41:33.224 --> 00:41:34.558
TO. THINK MORE DEEPLY ABOUT THE

00:41:34.625 --> 00:41:36.093
INNOVATIONS THAT RELIEVING ON

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:39.096
THE TABLE- BY NOT FOCUSING ON

00:41:39.163 --> 00:41:41.765
THE GAPS- YOU KNOW FOR GENDER

00:41:41.832 --> 00:41:42.833
FOR RACE FOR SOCIO ECONOMIC

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.469
STATUS ALL OF THOSE- WERE

00:41:45.536 --> 00:41:46.837
REALLY LEAVING BEHIND. A

00:41:46.904 --> 00:41:47.938
GENERATION OF CHANGED COURSE

00:41:48.005 --> 00:41:49.506
WE'RE NOT GIVING THE NEXT

00:41:49.573 --> 00:41:50.908
GENERATION OF INNOVATORS THE

00:41:50.975 --> 00:41:52.476
SKILLS THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE

00:41:52.543 --> 00:41:55.913
THE CHANGE IN THE WORLD. AND

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:57.514
YOU KNOW WE'RE LEAVING OUT AT A

00:41:57.581 --> 00:41:58.249
TIME WHEN YOU KNOW WE NEED

00:41:58.315 --> 00:41:59.950
INNOVATIONS AND TWIRLED MORE

00:42:00.017 --> 00:42:00.985
THAN EVER. WE DON'T WANT TO

00:42:01.051 --> 00:42:04.521
EXCLUDE ANY SEGMENT OF OUR

00:42:04.588 --> 00:42:05.723
TO MAKE THOSE INNOVATIONS MAKE

00:42:05.789 --> 00:42:12.096
THEM A REALITY. AND HELP YOU

00:42:12.162 --> 00:42:12.696
KNOW CHANGE OUR WORLD FOR THE

00:42:12.763 --> 00:42:15.299
FOR THE- SO. THANK YOU VERY

00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:16.600
MUCH CALIFORNIA QUESTIONS.

00:42:16.667 --> 00:42:17.968
THANK KARAN I KNOW YOU YOU

00:42:18.035 --> 00:42:19.770
TRAVEL FROM THE I THINK YOU'RE

00:42:19.837 --> 00:42:21.705
ON THE SPEAKER THAT COME FROM

00:42:21.772 --> 00:42:22.973
THE FOR THIS I THINK I'M PRETTY

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.642
SURE SO I REALLY APPRECIATE

00:42:24.708 --> 00:42:26.610
THAT FOR JOINING US HERE IN OUR

00:42:26.677 --> 00:42:29.213
STATE CAPITOL ON THIS IMPORTANT

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.749
ISSUE- SO NOW I WOULD LIKE TO

00:42:31.815 --> 00:42:33.751
OPEN IT UP TO THE COMMITTEE FOR

00:42:33.817 --> 00:42:38.055
QUESTIONS. I HAD A QUESTION

00:42:38.122 --> 00:42:41.792
FOR- MISS ROLLER- SO I DO WE

00:42:41.859 --> 00:42:42.993
ARE IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT ON

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:45.396
THE NEED TO GET MORE WOMEN INTO

00:42:45.462 --> 00:42:48.032
COMPUTER SCIENCE BUT- I FEAR

00:42:48.098 --> 00:42:49.900
THAT WE ARE SHORT CHANGING THE

00:42:49.967 --> 00:42:52.269
EFFORT IF WE FOCUS. IF OUR

00:42:52.336 --> 00:42:55.205
FOCUS IN THAT EFFORT IS TO.

00:42:55.272 --> 00:42:56.807
CREATE MORE COMPUTER SCIENCE

00:42:56.874 --> 00:42:58.709
PROGRAMS AT HIGH SCHOOLS. WHICH

00:42:58.776 --> 00:42:59.910
WAS WHAT- DOCTOR SCOTT WAS

00:42:59.977 --> 00:43:01.645
TALKING ABOUT AND- THAN

00:43:01.712 --> 00:43:02.913
MOTIVATE WOMEN TO GET INTO

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:04.248
THOSE PROGRAMS IT SEEMS OF TO

00:43:04.315 --> 00:43:05.215
BE WHAT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

00:43:05.282 --> 00:43:08.485
ABOUT AND- IN MY EXPERIENCE

00:43:08.552 --> 00:43:10.988
CULTIVATING. A PASSION FOR

00:43:11.055 --> 00:43:12.056
COMPUTER SCIENCE AND FOR

00:43:12.122 --> 00:43:14.158
PROGRAMMING IS NOT SOMETHING

00:43:14.224 --> 00:43:15.559
THAT IS BEST DONE AN ACADEMIC

00:43:15.626 --> 00:43:17.962
SETTING. THE VERY BEST SOFTWARE

00:43:18.028 --> 00:43:19.897
ENGINEERS THAT I HAVE KNOWN IN

00:43:19.964 --> 00:43:23.434
MY CAREER OR THE ONES THAT. GOT

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.169
OUT OF BED WANTING TO CODE WENT

00:43:25.235 --> 00:43:26.337
TO BED WANTING TO CODE YOU KNOW

00:43:26.403 --> 00:43:27.705
HAD THAT THAT- PASSION DURING

00:43:27.771 --> 00:43:29.606
PASSION FOR IT AND MOST OF THEM

00:43:29.673 --> 00:43:31.542
STARTED OUT IN AN ENVIRONMENT

00:43:31.608 --> 00:43:33.043
THAT IT WASN'T COMPULSORY AND

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:33.711
THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH AN

00:43:33.777 --> 00:43:35.245
ACADEMIC SETTING IS. YOU KNOW

00:43:35.312 --> 00:43:36.613
YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE A CLASS EVERY

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.215
WEEK YOU HAVE AN ASSIGNMENT YOU

00:43:38.282 --> 00:43:39.350
KNOW YOU ARE FORCED TO DO THIS

00:43:39.416 --> 00:43:40.784
AND THAT'S NOT A CRITICISM OF

00:43:40.851 --> 00:43:41.685
COMPUTER SCIENCE CURRICULUM

00:43:41.752 --> 00:43:43.354
IT'S JUST A FEATURE OF.

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:46.757
ACADEMIA THE BEST IN THE TO

00:43:46.824 --> 00:43:47.758
CULTIVATING A PASSION IS

00:43:47.825 --> 00:43:48.659
HANDING SOMEONE A BOOK IN A

00:43:48.726 --> 00:43:49.994
COMPUTER AND SAYING OKAY WHAT

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:51.128
HE YOU TEACH YOURSELF HOW TO

00:43:51.195 --> 00:43:52.730
PROGRAM WORKS THESE DAYS BE AN

00:43:52.796 --> 00:43:53.864
ONLINE PORTAL OR- KNOW

00:43:53.931 --> 00:43:55.899
SOMETHING THAT SELF DIRECTED-

00:43:55.966 --> 00:43:56.734
THERE WAS WITH WITH SOME

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:57.601
STRUCTURE TO IT BUT BUT

00:43:57.668 --> 00:44:00.504
SOMETHING THAT THAT. REQUIRED I

00:44:00.571 --> 00:44:04.041
THE- HE VOLUNTARY BY AND FROM

00:44:04.108 --> 00:44:05.309
OTHER WOMEN THAT WERE TRYING TO

00:44:05.376 --> 00:44:06.677
GET INTO THIS AND SO I'M

00:44:06.744 --> 00:44:07.644
WONDERING IF THERE ISN'T LIKE

00:44:07.711 --> 00:44:09.146
ANOTHER PRONG THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:44:09.213 --> 00:44:12.316
ADDED HERE TO MOTIVATE YOUNG

00:44:12.383 --> 00:44:12.883
GIRLS YOU KNOW TO HAVE THAT

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:15.819
PASSION. YEAH I THINK I THINK

00:44:15.886 --> 00:44:19.156
THAT'S RIGHT- I- YOU KNOW OUR

00:44:19.223 --> 00:44:21.191
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT FOR GIRLS-

00:44:21.258 --> 00:44:22.626
THERE IF YOU SPARKLES

00:44:22.693 --> 00:44:23.794
INTERESTING PETER SCIENCE.

00:44:23.861 --> 00:44:24.895
BEFORE THE END OF MIDDLE SCHOOL

00:44:24.962 --> 00:44:26.630
SHE'S MUCH MORE LIKELY TO

00:44:26.697 --> 00:44:28.399
CONSIDER IT YOU KNOW TO TAKE IT

00:44:28.465 --> 00:44:29.767
AS AN ACADEMIC SUBJECT IN HIGH

00:44:29.833 --> 00:44:31.235
SCHOOL AND- IN A PURSUE IT AND

00:44:31.301 --> 00:44:33.404
HIGHER AND AS A CAREER- AND SO

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:34.938
I AGREE WE NEED TO BE SPARKING

00:44:35.005 --> 00:44:36.940
GIRLS EARLIER. IN MIDDLE SCHOOL

00:44:37.007 --> 00:44:37.808
SORT OF LIKE THE LAST POSSIBLE

00:44:37.875 --> 00:44:39.810
CHANCE WE HAVE- BUT YOU KNOW

00:44:39.877 --> 00:44:41.045
OBVIOUSLY ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS

00:44:41.111 --> 00:44:43.313
OBVIOUSLY BETTER FOR THAT- I

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.049
THINK THAT. YOU KNOW THE

00:44:45.115 --> 00:44:46.950
SCHOOLS ARE THE PLACE WHERE-

00:44:47.017 --> 00:44:49.086
STUDENTS. GET EXPOSED TO A LOT

00:44:49.153 --> 00:44:51.188
OF DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES- AND I

00:44:51.255 --> 00:44:52.456
THINK THAT EXPANDING COMPUTER

00:44:52.523 --> 00:44:53.657
SCIENCE AT THE YOUNGER GRADES

00:44:53.724 --> 00:44:55.793
IS REALLY VITAL- FOR SORT OF

00:44:55.859 --> 00:44:56.960
SPARKING THAT INTEREST IN

00:44:57.027 --> 00:44:59.196
SPARKING THAT- YOU KNOW JOY IN

00:44:59.263 --> 00:45:00.597
CODING AND THEN YOU KNOW THEY

00:45:00.664 --> 00:45:02.332
HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. ON TO

00:45:02.399 --> 00:45:04.268
EXPLORE IT EXTRA CURRICULAR LEE

00:45:04.334 --> 00:45:06.670
OR YOU KNOW IN SCHOOL- AT YOU

00:45:06.737 --> 00:45:08.305
KNOW IN THE LATER GRADES AS IT

00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:09.106
GETS MORE COMPLICATED AS THEY

00:45:09.173 --> 00:45:11.241
NEED MORE- ADVANCED TRAINING IN

00:45:11.308 --> 00:45:14.778
IT- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SORT.

00:45:14.845 --> 00:45:16.280
OF SCHOOL PROGRAMS- THAT

00:45:16.346 --> 00:45:19.750
DIRECTLY TEACH GIRLS CODE. THE

00:45:19.817 --> 00:45:21.685
GIRL SO BUT YOU KNOW MOST AT

00:45:21.752 --> 00:45:23.053
THIS POINT ARE GETTING EXPOSED

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:23.754
TO COMPUTER SCIENCE AND

00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:26.490
LEARNING TO CODE IN SCHOOL- AND

00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:27.724
SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:45:27.791 --> 00:45:29.426
AS- YOU ADD THESE COMPUTER

00:45:29.493 --> 00:45:30.127
SCIENCE COURSES ARE BEING

00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:32.196
ADDED- THAT WE ARE DOING

00:45:32.262 --> 00:45:33.530
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET GIRLS.

00:45:33.597 --> 00:45:35.933
INTO THEM AS WELL- SO THERE

00:45:35.999 --> 00:45:37.134
THERE ARE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES

00:45:37.201 --> 00:45:38.769
RULES TO CODE OUT OF SCHOOL-

00:45:38.836 --> 00:45:39.736
BUT IF THEY'RE NOT BEING

00:45:39.803 --> 00:45:41.772
EXPOSED TO IT IN SCHOOL- WE

00:45:41.839 --> 00:45:42.306
DON'T THINK THEY'RE GONNA

00:45:42.372 --> 00:45:43.574
PURSUED THOSE OUT OF SCHOOL

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:44.575
OPPORTUNITIES. YEAH I

YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT THAT

00:45:49.413 --> 00:45:50.547
SPARKS THAT INITIAL INTEREST

00:45:50.614 --> 00:45:53.350
LIKE. ON CODING COMPETITIONS OR

00:45:53.417 --> 00:45:55.185
IN A REAL WORLD PROBLEMS THAT

00:45:55.252 --> 00:45:57.154
ARE OPENED UP TO SOLUTIONS FROM

00:45:57.221 --> 00:45:59.890
FROM- STUDENTS OR- INTERNSHIPS

00:45:59.957 --> 00:46:01.024
WHERE WE PARTNER THEM WITH.

00:46:01.091 --> 00:46:02.426
COMPANIES OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW

00:46:02.493 --> 00:46:03.927
THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE IT'S

00:46:03.994 --> 00:46:06.797
NOT I HAVE TO. IT'S SOMETHING

00:46:06.864 --> 00:46:09.166
WHERE. IS THERE MOTIVATED TO

00:46:09.233 --> 00:46:10.334
TAKE THAT STEP THEM. YEAH AND

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:12.169
WE YOU KNOW WE SEE. GIRLS ALL

00:46:12.236 --> 00:46:13.470
THE TIME ONCE THEY HAVE YOU

00:46:13.537 --> 00:46:14.571
KNOW WANT TO HAVE EVEN THE MOST

00:46:14.638 --> 00:46:16.673
BASIC TECHNOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:17.708
WOULD SAY THOSE BASIC CODING

00:46:17.774 --> 00:46:19.977
KNOWLEDGE. THEY WILL THEY WILL

00:46:20.043 --> 00:46:21.078
THEY ARE SPARKED AND THEY GO

00:46:21.145 --> 00:46:22.646
OFF ON THEIR OWN WE SEE GIRLS

00:46:22.713 --> 00:46:24.948
COME OUT OF OUR PROGRAMS- THAT

00:46:25.015 --> 00:46:26.049
HAVE YOU KNOW JUST A BASIC

00:46:26.116 --> 00:46:28.218
CODING KNOWLEDGE- AND- THEY GO

00:46:28.285 --> 00:46:29.553
ON AND THEY SAY OH I WANT TO

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:30.621
LEARN HOW TO DO THIS LANGUAGE

00:46:30.687 --> 00:46:31.822
IN THIS LANGUAGE. AND THEN THEY

00:46:31.889 --> 00:46:33.790
ARE BUILDING ALL KINDS OF TOOLS

00:46:33.857 --> 00:46:34.858
BASED ON PROBLEMS THAT THEY'RE

00:46:34.925 --> 00:46:36.593
SEEING- BASED ON SORT OF THIS

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:39.129
LIKE INITIAL SPARK- SO I. I

00:46:39.196 --> 00:46:42.166
AGREE- AT BUT WE ARE AT IT WHAT

00:46:42.232 --> 00:46:44.034
YOUR SAYING IS BORN OUT AND

00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:45.536
WHAT WE SEE GIRLS BUILDING WITH

00:46:45.602 --> 00:46:47.571
THEIR SORT OF- KNOWLEDGE OF

00:46:47.638 --> 00:46:49.139
CODING AND COMPUTER SCIENCE.

00:46:49.206 --> 00:46:50.140
THANK YOU CAN I JUST ADD ONE

00:46:50.207 --> 00:46:51.808
OTHER COMMENT. I'M I ALSO GREEN

00:46:51.875 --> 00:46:54.244
I THINK. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

00:46:54.311 --> 00:46:54.811
TO THINK ABOUT THE ALIGNMENT

00:46:54.878 --> 00:46:56.313
BETWEEN IN SCHOOL AND OUT OF

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:57.047
SCHOOL BECAUSE ONE OF THE

00:46:57.114 --> 00:46:59.049
THINGS THAT WE KEPT SEEING TIME

00:46:59.116 --> 00:46:59.983
AND TIME AGAIN OR STUDENTS WHO

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:01.285
GOT. SOME EXPOSURE IN AND OUT

00:47:01.351 --> 00:47:03.687
OF SCHOOL LIKE COUPON OUR CAMP.

00:47:03.754 --> 00:47:04.721
AND REALLY WANTED TO PURSUE

00:47:04.788 --> 00:47:05.889
COMPUTER SCIENCE AND DIDN'T

00:47:05.956 --> 00:47:07.157
HAVE ANOTHER PLACE TO GO IN THE

00:47:07.224 --> 00:47:08.926
SCHOOL DAY TO CONTINUE THEIR

00:47:08.992 --> 00:47:10.327
KNOWLEDGE AND SO I THINK. THE

00:47:10.394 --> 00:47:11.528
MORE WE CAN ONLINE THOSE TWO

00:47:11.595 --> 00:47:13.463
TOGETHER SO SPARKING INTEREST.

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:14.765
I'M GETTING STUDENTS I'M

00:47:14.831 --> 00:47:15.999
INTERESTED IN ENGAGED AND THEN

00:47:16.066 --> 00:47:18.502
HAVING A PLACE FOR THEM TO- TO

00:47:18.569 --> 00:47:23.006
ENTER INTO A PATHWAY BEARD- I

00:47:23.073 --> 00:47:25.842
AGREE BUT I MEAN I THINK THAT.

00:47:25.909 --> 00:47:29.613
VOTE IN HIS. ON THAT. THERE

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:34.218
CAN. PASS THAT'S NOT A NOT A-

00:47:34.284 --> 00:47:39.089
PATHWAY. AND MAYBE IT'S- YOU

00:47:39.156 --> 00:47:41.892
KNOW. A COMPUTER PROGRAM AND-

00:47:41.959 --> 00:47:48.332
THE OUT THEM YOU KNOW.

00:47:48.398 --> 00:47:49.833
ASSEMBLYMEMBER BERMAN FOR LACK

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:50.934
OF BREAKING OF THAT FEAR IS

00:47:51.001 --> 00:47:54.037
AGREEMENT- NO I APPRECIATE THE

00:47:54.104 --> 00:47:55.205
COMMENTS FROM FROM MY

00:47:55.272 --> 00:47:56.907
COLLEAGUE- OUT BUT IT REMINDED

00:47:56.974 --> 00:47:58.742
ME OF A STORY THAT I'M GONNA

00:47:58.809 --> 00:48:00.410
STEAL FROM RUN GONZALEZ WHO IS

00:48:00.477 --> 00:48:02.346
THE FORMER MAYOR OF SAN JOSE-

00:48:02.412 --> 00:48:03.947
WHO'S NOW THE CO I THINK STILL

00:48:04.014 --> 00:48:05.048
OF THE HISPANIC FOUNDATION OF

00:48:05.115 --> 00:48:06.483
SILICON VALLEY. WHO WOULD SAY

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:07.751
THAT WHEN HE BE TALKING WITH

00:48:07.818 --> 00:48:09.052
WITH YOUNG STUDENTS IN EAST

00:48:09.119 --> 00:48:11.722
SIDE SAN JOSE- AND HE WOULD ASK

00:48:11.788 --> 00:48:12.322
THEM WHO KNOWS WHAT THE

00:48:12.389 --> 00:48:14.291
ENGINEER IS- MOST THEM WOULD

00:48:14.358 --> 00:48:16.293
RAISE THEIR HANDS- AND THEN THE

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:17.594
FEW THAT WOULD WOULD SAY

00:48:17.661 --> 00:48:18.195
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO DRIVE THE

00:48:18.262 --> 00:48:20.664
TRAIN- AND SO I THINK IT'S JUST

00:48:20.731 --> 00:48:23.867
AWARENESS- AN OPPORTUNITY AND

00:48:23.934 --> 00:48:25.068
ACCESS. THAT A LOT OF STUDENTS

00:48:25.135 --> 00:48:26.803
DOESN'T COME IN THEIR COMMUNITY

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:28.872
AND FOR IN IN MY DISTRICT. FOR

00:48:28.939 --> 00:48:29.640
THE KIDS WHO GREW UP IN PALO

00:48:29.706 --> 00:48:31.942
ALTO THEY'RE BORN WITH AN IPAD

00:48:32.009 --> 00:48:32.476
IN THEIR HANDS AND THEY'RE

00:48:32.542 --> 00:48:34.478
DIGITAL NATIVES BUT TO- AND YOU

00:48:34.544 --> 00:48:36.079
KNOW IT IT'S SOMETHING THAT. IS

00:48:36.146 --> 00:48:36.947
SPARKED A LITTLE MORE

00:48:37.014 --> 00:48:38.348
ORGANICALLY WITHIN THEM BECAUSE

00:48:38.415 --> 00:48:39.650
THEY SEE IT EVERYWHERE AROUND

00:48:39.716 --> 00:48:41.251
THEM- BUT I THINK THAT WE HAVE

00:48:41.318 --> 00:48:42.119
A LOT OF COMMUNITIES IN

00:48:42.185 --> 00:48:43.220
CALIFORNIA WHERE THAT'S NOT THE

00:48:43.287 --> 00:48:45.956
CASE AND WHERE. THE PARENTS AND

00:48:46.023 --> 00:48:47.557
THE- ROLE MODELS IN THE

00:48:47.624 --> 00:48:49.159
LEADERS. AND THOSE COMMUNITIES

00:48:49.226 --> 00:48:52.462
DON'T WORK IN INTACT- AND SO

00:48:52.529 --> 00:48:53.096
THE STUDENTS TO DON'T EVEN KNOW

00:48:53.163 --> 00:48:56.166
IT EXISTS- AND SO IF YOU. DON'T

00:48:56.233 --> 00:48:58.268
HAVE IT IN SCHOOL AND IF IT'S

00:48:58.335 --> 00:48:59.069
NOT COMPULSORY IN SOME WAY

00:48:59.136 --> 00:49:01.204
SHAPE OR FORM. IT DOESN'T. GET

00:49:01.271 --> 00:49:02.205
THAT. OPPORTUNITY THAT IS THAT

00:49:02.272 --> 00:49:05.242
THAT. MARK NEVER GETS. IGNITED

00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:06.576
AND SO IT IT IS A FINE LINE I

00:49:06.643 --> 00:49:08.412
THINK. YOU KNOW YOU'RE ACTUALLY

00:49:08.478 --> 00:49:09.546
RIGHT THAT THE BEST WAY IS THAT

00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:11.915
ORGANIC WAY. ON BUT A LOT OF

00:49:11.982 --> 00:49:13.183
COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY NEVER

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:14.151
EVEN GET THAT AGAIN

00:49:14.217 --> 00:49:15.519
OPPORTUNITY. TO BEGIN WITH AND

00:49:15.585 --> 00:49:17.254
SO HOW DO WE AND OF. EXPAND

00:49:17.321 --> 00:49:19.923
THAT ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY-

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:21.858
THIS IS THE- IS A CHALLENGE NOT

00:49:21.925 --> 00:49:25.429
THE- ONES WITH A- YEAH AND- TO

00:49:25.495 --> 00:49:27.130
BUILD OFF OF THAT- BRUNCH TV

00:49:27.197 --> 00:49:29.066
AT. STANFORD DID A STUDY ABOUT

00:49:29.132 --> 00:49:31.468
TWO YEARS AGO- ABOUT EXPOSURE

00:49:31.535 --> 00:49:33.904
TO INVENTORS- AND A CHILD'S

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:35.339
LIKELIHOOD TO THEN BECOME AN

00:49:35.405 --> 00:49:37.841
INVENTOR THEMSELVES- AND- IT.

00:49:37.908 --> 00:49:39.309
IT VERY CLEARLY SHOWS THAT

00:49:39.376 --> 00:49:40.844
CHILDREN WHO ARE EXPOSED TO.

00:49:40.911 --> 00:49:42.946
INVENTIONS AND INNOVATIONS AND

00:49:43.013 --> 00:49:44.715
NEW TECHNOLOGIES AS CHILDREN

00:49:44.781 --> 00:49:47.184
ARE. UNLIKELY TO GO ON- TO EVEN

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:49.186
YOU KNOW KNOW THAT THEY HAVE

00:49:49.252 --> 00:49:51.154
THAT POSSIBILITY AS ADULTS- AND

00:49:51.221 --> 00:49:52.789
SO YOU KNOW JUST THIS EXPOSURE

00:49:52.856 --> 00:49:55.158
TO YOUNG AGE TO- THE NEXT

00:49:55.225 --> 00:49:56.793
GENERATION OF TECHNOLOGY THAT.

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.695
GENERATION OF. HOLES CAN GO ON

00:49:58.762 --> 00:49:59.296
TO SORT OF CREATE THE STATE.

00:49:59.363 --> 00:50:01.765
CORRECTION OF MAKERS. OKAY

00:50:01.832 --> 00:50:03.667
THANK YOU BEFORE WE MOVE ON I

00:50:03.734 --> 00:50:05.769
WHEN IT KNOWLEDGE- THAT

00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:07.237
ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS

00:50:07.304 --> 00:50:08.739
HAS JOINED US THANK YOU FOR

00:50:08.805 --> 00:50:11.074

HAVE A QUESTION AND- YOU KNOW.

00:50:14.511 --> 00:50:16.380
A COMMENT TO YOU KNOW I. YOU

00:50:16.446 --> 00:50:17.681
KNOW I WAS EXPOSED TO COMPUTER

00:50:17.748 --> 00:50:20.450
SCIENCE WHEN I WAS TEN- THIS IS

00:50:20.517 --> 00:50:22.119
IN THE EIGHTIES IN NINETEEN

00:50:22.185 --> 00:50:23.687
EIGHTY FOUR- AS YOU KNOW WE

00:50:23.754 --> 00:50:25.255
DON'T HAVE COMPUTERS AT HOME OR

00:50:25.322 --> 00:50:28.091
MOST OF A STUDENT- AND IT WAS

00:50:28.158 --> 00:50:29.659
THROUGH SCHOOL AND IT WAS JUST

00:50:29.726 --> 00:50:30.394
LIKE AN EXTRA CURRICULAR

00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:31.661
ACTIVITY. IN MY FIFTH GRADE

00:50:31.728 --> 00:50:34.164
CLASSROOM. I'M A I DIDN'T KNOW

00:50:34.231 --> 00:50:36.032
AN ENGINEER YOU KNOW MY FAMILY

00:50:36.099 --> 00:50:38.735
ARE IMMIGRANTS FROM MEXICO-

00:50:38.802 --> 00:50:40.103
THEY'RE NOT PROFESSIONALS I'M

00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:42.472
YOU KNOW JUST HARD WORKERS- BUT

00:50:42.539 --> 00:50:43.874
I HAD. DIDN'T KNOW SCIENTISTS

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:45.609
DIDN'T KNOW AN ENGINEER I

00:50:45.675 --> 00:50:47.210
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THIS WAS

00:50:47.277 --> 00:50:49.146
A CAREER I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST

00:50:49.212 --> 00:50:49.746
A CLASSROOM ACTIVITY. JUST A

00:50:49.813 --> 00:50:51.848
FUN ACTIVITY SCHOOL AND

00:50:51.915 --> 00:50:54.651
REMEMBER THE MOMENT THAT MY

00:50:54.718 --> 00:50:56.720
TEACHER TOLD ME. YOU SHOULD

00:50:56.787 --> 00:50:59.623
CONSIDER THIS AS A CAREER.

00:50:59.689 --> 00:51:00.857
WE'LL GET PAID TO THIS. I HAD

00:51:00.924 --> 00:51:03.193
NO IDEA. THE CLASS I ASSOCIATED

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:05.829
WITH SCHOOL BUT IT WAS FN- AND

00:51:05.896 --> 00:51:08.465
THAT'S WHAT CHANGED. MY LIFE

00:51:08.532 --> 00:51:11.101
AND MY- MY FOCUS IN IN MIDDLE

00:51:11.168 --> 00:51:13.069
SCHOOL AND THEN IN HIGH SCHOOL

00:51:13.136 --> 00:51:15.305
WAS FOCUSING ON HOW CAN I DO

00:51:15.372 --> 00:51:17.040
THIS. BECAUSE THAT I MEAN I

00:51:17.107 --> 00:51:17.974
DON'T EVEN KNOW IS A CAREER

00:51:18.041 --> 00:51:19.276
EVEN THOUGH I WAS DOING IT I

00:51:19.342 --> 00:51:21.344
WAS PROGRAMMING. AND HAD NO

00:51:21.411 --> 00:51:23.113
IDEA THAT IT WAS SOMETHING

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:25.415
PEOPLE DID FOR A LIVING- AND

00:51:25.482 --> 00:51:27.517
ESPECIALLY BACK THEN WE DIDN'T

00:51:27.584 --> 00:51:29.686
HAVE ALL OF THESE TECHNOLOGY.

00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:31.621
YOU KNOW DEVICES AND IT WASN'T

00:51:31.688 --> 00:51:33.223
AS PREVAIL AND OBVIOUSLY AS IT

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:35.926
IS TODAY. AND SO JUST SOMETHING

00:51:35.992 --> 00:51:37.627
LIKE THAT THAT INITIAL EXPOSE

00:51:37.694 --> 00:51:39.763
OUR- EXPOSURE I THINK CAN

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:41.498
REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR A

00:51:41.565 --> 00:51:42.833
LOT OF US THAT ARE FROM

00:51:42.899 --> 00:51:44.768
UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. ARE

A QUESTION. BOTH OF YOU TALKED

00:51:54.344 --> 00:51:57.147
ABOUT THE LACK OF DATA- THAT WE

00:51:57.214 --> 00:51:57.881
HAVE DO YOU HAVE

00:51:57.948 --> 00:52:00.250
RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW. WE CAN

00:52:00.317 --> 00:52:02.719
COLLECT DATA SO WE CAN BETTER

00:52:02.786 --> 00:52:07.657
IDENTIFY THE GAPS. I WELL. TO

00:52:07.724 --> 00:52:09.392
START TRACKING IT IS WHERE WE

00:52:09.459 --> 00:52:13.196
BEGIN I. AS A YEAR THERE AGAIN

00:52:13.263 --> 00:52:16.099
THERE IS A VERY. YOU'RE A LACK

00:52:16.166 --> 00:52:17.868
OF DATA ON COMPUTER BECAUSE

00:52:17.934 --> 00:52:18.802
THERE'S A LACK OF IT ON

00:52:18.869 --> 00:52:19.870
COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES AND

00:52:19.936 --> 00:52:22.706
PARTICIPATION- BROADLY ACROSS

00:52:22.772 --> 00:52:24.841
THE COUNTRY- WITH THE EXCEPTION

00:52:24.908 --> 00:52:28.245
OF THE AP EXAMS- AND SO TO

00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:29.913
BEGIN JUST START TRACKING-

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.648
WHO'S TAKING A COMPUTER SCIENCE

00:52:31.715 --> 00:52:33.149
COURSES- AND WHO'S TEACHING

00:52:33.216 --> 00:52:34.518
THEM- WHERE THEY'RE BEING

00:52:34.584 --> 00:52:37.387
OFFERED- WE YOU KNOW WE TRIED

00:52:37.454 --> 00:52:38.355
IT WE WANT TO REALLY START

00:52:38.421 --> 00:52:39.723
LOOKING AT WHERE THE GAPS ARE

00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:40.857
FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND

00:52:40.924 --> 00:52:42.926
WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW GIRLS.

00:52:42.993 --> 00:52:43.793
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS BY RACE I

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:45.328
SO SHE COULD NOT STOP LANGUAGE

00:52:45.395 --> 00:52:47.697
LEARNER STATUS- BY DISABILITY

00:52:47.764 --> 00:52:49.399
STATUS WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE

00:52:49.466 --> 00:52:49.933
SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING A

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.268
COMPLETE PICTURE OF WHO'S

00:52:51.334 --> 00:52:53.703
TAKING THESE COURSES NUMBER

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:55.539
SEVEN JET JUST TO LOOK AT IT BY

00:52:55.605 --> 00:52:57.107
IN THOSE CAPPERS JUST DECIDE

00:52:57.173 --> 00:52:58.408
RIGHT SO WE TALKED A LOT THE IT

00:52:58.475 --> 00:52:59.809
UP. FOR YOU BLACK GIRLS IN THE

00:52:59.876 --> 00:53:01.311
AP COMPUTER SCIENCE EXAM HOW

00:53:01.378 --> 00:53:02.612
MANY WHAT GIRLS ARE TAKING

00:53:02.679 --> 00:53:04.514
OTHER COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES-

00:53:04.581 --> 00:53:06.082
THAT ARE IN OUR SCHOOLS WOULD

00:53:06.149 --> 00:53:09.419
YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW SO I

00:53:09.486 --> 00:53:10.353
WOULD SAY. THE FIRST IS TO

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:11.988
BEGIN TO. IT AT THE SECOND

00:53:12.055 --> 00:53:14.057
THING IS TO HAVE THAT DATA. BE

00:53:14.124 --> 00:53:15.759
PUBLICLY REPORTED OUT- YOU

00:53:15.825 --> 00:53:17.193
KNOW. WHAT GETS MEASURED GETS

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:19.296
MANAGE THERE'S SO MUCH DATA ON

00:53:19.362 --> 00:53:19.930
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR

00:53:19.996 --> 00:53:22.532
SCHOOLS- AND IT'S ONLY THROUGH

00:53:22.599 --> 00:53:24.000
YOU KNOW HAVING THE DATA BECOME

00:53:24.067 --> 00:53:25.035
PUBLIC AND HAVING A

00:53:25.101 --> 00:53:26.736
CONVERSATION. ABOUT WHERE THE

00:53:26.803 --> 00:53:27.904
GAPS ARE AND WHO IS BEING

00:53:27.971 --> 00:53:29.239
SERVED AND WHO IS NOT BEING

00:53:29.306 --> 00:53:30.740
SERVED- THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY

00:53:30.807 --> 00:53:32.909
DESIGN POLICY INTERVENTIONS- TO

00:53:32.976 --> 00:53:34.811
CHANGE THE DYNAMIC- SO I WOULD

00:53:34.878 --> 00:53:37.414
SAY YOU KNOW START TRACKING IN

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:38.014
IN SCHOOLS AND START PUBLICLY

00:53:38.081 --> 00:53:39.950
REPORTING THAT. IT OUT SO THAT

00:53:40.016 --> 00:53:40.750
YOU KNOW THERE CAN BE A

00:53:40.817 --> 00:53:43.420
CONVERSATION- AT ABOUT YOU KNOW

00:53:43.486 --> 00:53:44.688
WHAT THE INTERACTIONS NEED TO

00:53:44.754 --> 00:53:46.856
BE- AND WHERE- BECAUSE THERE'S

00:53:46.923 --> 00:53:48.224
YOU KNOW WE- HAVE A HUGE.

00:53:48.291 --> 00:53:50.460
BARGAIN BASEMENT- IN THIS NEW

00:53:50.527 --> 00:53:52.095
DISCIPLINE IS REALLY EXCITING-

00:53:52.162 --> 00:53:53.463
BUT WE DO NEED TO MAKE SURE

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:55.365
THAT WE ARE DOING THIS- WITH AN

00:53:55.432 --> 00:53:58.401
EYE ON EQUITY- AND WITH AN EYE.

00:53:58.468 --> 00:54:00.904
ON INCLUSION. DISTANCE AND I

00:54:00.971 --> 00:54:02.138
JUST ADD TO THAT. SO ORDER FOR

00:54:02.205 --> 00:54:04.240
US TO DO THIS I HAVE A STUDY

00:54:04.307 --> 00:54:05.342
THAT WE PRESENTED THE DATA ON

00:54:05.408 --> 00:54:07.310
WE HAD TO MERGE I THINK IT WAS.

00:54:07.377 --> 00:54:08.478
THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT DATA

00:54:08.545 --> 00:54:09.512
SETS SO THE DATA IS BEING

00:54:09.579 --> 00:54:11.548
COLLECTED AT CD AND- CD HAS

00:54:11.615 --> 00:54:12.916
BEEN WONDERFUL TO WORK WITH AND

00:54:12.983 --> 00:54:14.551
GIVING US THE DATA- BUT IT'S

00:54:14.618 --> 00:54:16.419
NOT EASY TO ACCESS AND I THINK

00:54:16.486 --> 00:54:17.654
THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM IS

00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:18.588
FIGURING OUT. LIKE TO DISAGREED

00:54:18.655 --> 00:54:20.824
ALL OF STATE UP. BY DONE BY

00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:22.359
GEOGRAPHY BY COUNTY. YOU HAVE

00:54:22.425 --> 00:54:23.393
TO MERGE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:24.761
DATA SETS SO THAT'S ONE IS TO

00:54:24.828 --> 00:54:26.630
SIMPLIFY THE WAYS IN WHICH ON

00:54:26.696 --> 00:54:28.031
THE DAY OF BEING. BOTH

00:54:28.098 --> 00:54:30.600
COLLECTED REPORTED- IN SECOND-

00:54:30.667 --> 00:54:33.069
FOR K. THROUGH. SIX WE HAVE

00:54:33.136 --> 00:54:34.771
VERY LITTLE TO NO DATA ABOUT

00:54:34.838 --> 00:54:35.505
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THOSE

00:54:35.572 --> 00:54:37.207
CLASSROOMS WHICH IS INCREDIBLY

00:54:37.273 --> 00:54:38.675
IMPORTANT AS WE THINK ABOUT

00:54:38.742 --> 00:54:40.510
EARLY EXPOSURE TO. COME UP THE

00:54:40.577 --> 00:54:41.845
CAKES ABOUT ANOTHER

00:54:41.911 --> 00:54:43.747
RECOMMENDATION. YEAH AND SIR

00:54:43.813 --> 00:54:47.917
ALAN DISCOTEK ONE MORE THING ON.

00:54:47.984 --> 00:54:49.552
LOS CODE AND- THE PAPER CENTER

00:54:49.619 --> 00:54:50.153
SHOULD NOW BE THE ONES TELLING

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:50.687
THIS. ABOUT WHAT HAPPENING

00:54:50.754 --> 00:54:52.022
PETER SCIENCE IT CALIFORNIA

00:54:52.088 --> 00:54:53.156
SHOULD BE TELLING ITS OWN

00:54:53.223 --> 00:54:54.891
STORY. ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING

00:54:54.958 --> 00:54:56.726
IN COMPUTER SCIENCE- AND YOU

00:54:56.793 --> 00:54:58.228
KNOW HI LIVING THE SUCCESSES

THAT WHERE THERE ARE

00:55:00.797 --> 00:55:02.065
COMMUNITIES WHERE YOUR SCIENCE

00:55:02.132 --> 00:55:03.133
CLASSROOMS LOOK LIKE THE

00:55:03.199 --> 00:55:04.601
SCHOOLS- AND LIKE THE

00:55:04.668 --> 00:55:06.436
COMMUNITIES THAT THERE AND SO-

00:55:06.503 --> 00:55:07.871
WE- WE SHOULD NOT BE THE ONE

00:55:09.539 --> 00:55:10.473
WHY I WOULD SAY START WITH

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:11.508
TRACKING AND PUBLICLY REPORT

00:55:11.574 --> 00:55:13.443
THE DATA AND HAVING A

00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:14.044
CONVERSATION ABOUT IT. THANK

GROWING TECH INDUSTRY. WE WILL

00:55:33.063 --> 00:55:34.297
ALSO EXPLORE HOW WE CAN BUILD

00:55:34.364 --> 00:55:35.832
AN INCLUSIVE PIPELINE SO THAT

00:55:35.899 --> 00:55:37.267
EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO COMPUTER

00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:40.036
SCIENCE. OUR FIRST TWO SPEAKERS

00:55:40.103 --> 00:55:40.570

WHEN I STARTED AT THE BUILDING

00:56:40.263 --> 00:56:41.131
TRADES COUNCIL ONE OF THE

00:56:41.197 --> 00:56:42.899
THINGS I WORK I WAS INVOLVED IN

00:56:42.966 --> 00:56:44.701
WAS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. AND

00:56:44.768 --> 00:56:46.903
ALSO THAT HIGH SCHOOL IN THE

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:49.005
PIPELINE TO THE TRADES. BACK

00:56:49.072 --> 00:56:51.741
THEN- WE WERE LOOKING AT THE

00:56:51.808 --> 00:56:54.110
CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION OUR

00:56:54.177 --> 00:56:56.246
SYSTEM AS A WHOLE AND WHAT HAD

00:56:56.312 --> 00:56:58.314
HAPPENED TO THE ACTUAL SYSTEM

00:56:58.381 --> 00:56:59.816
THAT ACTUALLY OF BEING-

00:56:59.883 --> 00:57:02.085
ELIMINATED FROM HIGH SCHOOLS-

00:57:02.152 --> 00:57:03.453
USED TO BE THE VOTE GETTING FOR

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:05.622
MANY REASONS THAT- WAS TAKEN

00:57:05.688 --> 00:57:08.391
AWAY. AND SO WHICH WE SAW WAS

PRESIDENT AND THE STATE

00:57:16.199 --> 00:57:17.667
BUILDING TRADES PRESIDENT GOT

00:57:17.734 --> 00:57:19.402
TOGETHER AND WE SAW SORT OF THE

00:57:19.469 --> 00:57:21.905
UNIQUENESS OF THE SOME AREAS

00:57:21.971 --> 00:57:23.606
THAT WE HAVE WITH WORKFORCE

00:57:23.673 --> 00:57:28.311
DEVELOPMENT ISSUES. HE WORKS IN

00:57:28.378 --> 00:57:30.313
OF. THE OUR AT THE A OF TWENTY

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:31.948
SEVEN TO PRINT IS A WHERE WHEN

00:57:32.015 --> 00:57:32.482
CAREER TECHNICAL AND- WAS

00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:34.450
ACTUALLY. ALIVE AND WELL AT THE

00:57:34.517 --> 00:57:35.618
HIGH SCHOOL SYSTEM THERE ARE

00:57:35.685 --> 00:57:37.487
THOSE CANONS WERE EIGHTEEN AND

00:57:37.554 --> 00:57:39.422
NINETEEN YEARS OLD- YOU SEEN

00:57:39.489 --> 00:57:42.325
NEWS REPORTS ABOUT- HOW

00:57:42.392 --> 00:57:43.893
APPRENTICESHIP IN CONSTRUCTION

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.995
BEING A GOOD WAGE JOB IN THE

00:57:46.062 --> 00:57:47.797
UNIONIZED CONSTRUCTION TRADES.

00:57:47.864 --> 00:57:49.465
ACTUALLY CAN BE EQUAL TO THE

00:57:49.532 --> 00:57:51.935
SAME EARNINGS AS A COLLEGE

00:57:52.001 --> 00:57:54.871
GRADUATE. KEEPING IN MIND A LOT

00:57:54.938 --> 00:57:56.606
OF THE THAT THAT COLLEGE

00:57:56.673 --> 00:57:59.008
GRADUATES AND KERR AND ALSO THE%

00:57:59.075 --> 00:58:01.444
CYCLICAL NATURE OF CONSTRUCTION

00:58:01.511 --> 00:58:02.779
THEY'RE STILL VERY MUCH

00:58:02.846 --> 00:58:05.682
COMPARABLE. AND SO- WHEN WE

00:58:05.748 --> 00:58:06.983
LOOK AT OUR PROGRAMS AND HOW

00:58:07.050 --> 00:58:08.751
MUCH MONEY WE INVEST INTO OUR

00:58:08.818 --> 00:58:11.354
PROGRAMS- IT'S OVER A HUNDRED

00:58:11.421 --> 00:58:12.255
MILLION DOLLAR STIR

00:58:12.322 --> 00:58:14.224
GEOGRAPHICALLY LOCATED IN EVERY

00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:16.159
ASPECT OF THE STATE. WE BUILD

00:58:16.226 --> 00:58:17.126
PRETTY MUCH ALL THE

00:58:17.193 --> 00:58:18.661
INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE STATE OF

00:58:18.728 --> 00:58:21.264
CALIFORNIA- THESE ARE NOT THE

00:58:21.331 --> 00:58:23.299
JOBS OF THE NINETEEN FIFTIES

00:58:23.366 --> 00:58:25.034
AND NINETEEN SIXTIES ARE HIGHLY

00:58:25.101 --> 00:58:27.036
TECHNICAL WERE BUILDING COMPLEX

00:58:27.103 --> 00:58:28.738
FACILITIES- WILL BUILDING THE

00:58:28.805 --> 00:58:29.839
NEW RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS

00:58:29.906 --> 00:58:32.775
OF TODAY. AND TOMORROW AS WELL

00:58:32.842 --> 00:58:34.744
AS THE INDUSTRIAL OF FACILITIES

00:58:34.811 --> 00:58:35.979
ARE STILL KEEP OUR ECONOMY

00:58:36.045 --> 00:58:38.047
GOING AND SO WHY WERE WERE

00:58:38.114 --> 00:58:39.749
INVESTED IN THIS PARTNERSHIP IS

00:58:39.816 --> 00:58:41.451
BECAUSE WE WERE SEEING THAT THE

WORKING LA AT ELECTRONICS

01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:19.275
BOUTIQUE WORSE. THEY COULD BE

STATE OF THE ART HOSPITAL-

01:01:48.604 --> 01:01:50.506
TALKS ABOUT BILL BUILDING

01:01:50.573 --> 01:01:52.108
INFORMATION MODELING WHICH ALL

01:01:52.175 --> 01:01:53.176
OF OUR PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS

01:01:53.242 --> 01:01:55.845
USE. OF ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE

SYSTEMS FOR ACTUAL CLEAR AIR

01:02:01.317 --> 01:02:02.285
THAT'S FILTERED INTO THE

01:02:02.351 --> 01:02:04.887
HOSPITAL AND SO ON AND SO ON

01:02:04.954 --> 01:02:06.089
AND SO ON HIGHLY TECHNICAL

01:02:06.155 --> 01:02:08.991
HOSPITAL PART OF WAS. AT THE

01:02:09.058 --> 01:02:12.361
PROJECT INVITED STE IT'S FROM

ON. HIGH SCHOOL WHICH IS A

01:02:13.629 --> 01:02:15.031
CAREER RECORD CATION HIGH

01:02:15.098 --> 01:02:16.466
SCHOOL SAN FRANCISCO WHICH

ABSOLUTE OF. YOUR SITE AND THEN

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.351
DURING SELF. WHAT I WOULD ALSO

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:35.985
SUGGEST HERE IS THE STATUS LOW

01:02:36.052 --> 01:02:37.687
TOWARD A MODEL TWO X. OUR

01:02:37.753 --> 01:02:38.855
PARTNERSHIP TO OTHER AREA THAT

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:41.290
ARE NOT TRADITIONAL PERMISSIONS

01:02:41.357 --> 01:02:43.359
SO TO HAVE A COMPRENDER SHIP

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:46.963
PROGRAM. FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE

01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:48.097
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT I THINK YOU

01:02:48.164 --> 01:02:49.232
SHOULD LOOK AT IT THE

01:02:49.298 --> 01:02:51.167
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS-

01:02:51.234 --> 01:02:53.369
REORGANIZING THE WORKFORCE

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:54.337
DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM IS

01:02:54.403 --> 01:02:55.838
COLLAPSING ALL OF THE WORK

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:57.039
FORCE PROGRAMS INTO ONE

01:02:57.106 --> 01:02:58.274
DEPARTMENT CALLED THE-

01:02:58.341 --> 01:03:00.143
DEPARTMENT OF BETTER JOBS AND A

01:03:00.209 --> 01:03:01.911
HIGHER WAGES IT'S GONNA TAKE

01:03:01.978 --> 01:03:03.980
AWHILE TO GET USED TO WRITE-

01:03:04.046 --> 01:03:05.314
BUT IT'S INNOVATIVE KIND OF

01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:07.416
IDEA BECAUSE THEY WERE LOOKING

01:03:07.483 --> 01:03:08.584
AT A PARTNERSHIP. AND THE WAY

01:03:08.651 --> 01:03:09.819
THAT IT'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL

01:03:09.886 --> 01:03:11.187
THE BEFORE THE BUILDING TRADES

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:12.955
AND ALSO EXPANDING THAT TO

01:03:13.022 --> 01:03:14.991
NONTRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES SO I

01:03:15.057 --> 01:03:16.292
WOULD LOOK AT THAT ALSO LOOK AT

01:03:16.359 --> 01:03:18.761
PARTNERSHIP ACADEMIES THAT WE

01:03:18.828 --> 01:03:19.228
ARE PARTNERED WITH THE

01:03:19.295 --> 01:03:20.796
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WHERE

01:03:20.863 --> 01:03:21.731
WE ACTUALLY GIVE THEM THE

01:03:21.797 --> 01:03:23.666
CURRICULUM THAT WILL ACTUALLY

READY INTER INTER PRESSURE

01:03:28.671 --> 01:03:30.540
PROGRAMS AND I THINK INDUSTRY

CAN BE VITAL AND ACTUALLY

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:33.142

MEMBERSHIP WE TALK A LOT ABOUT

01:05:30.359 --> 01:05:32.962
CTP BUT WE DON'T TALK SO MUCH

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:34.063
ABOUT STEM IN THE MANUFACTURING

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:36.932
INDUSTRY. AND SO I WANTED TO.

01:05:36.999 --> 01:05:40.569
GO TO MY- MY INDUSTRY FOLKS AND

01:05:40.636 --> 01:05:42.705
CHALLENGE THEM TO TELL ME YOU

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:43.773
KNOW WHAT IS THE CORRELATION

01:05:43.839 --> 01:05:45.508
BETWEEN STEM AND MANUFACTURING

01:05:45.574 --> 01:05:46.375
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COMPUTER

01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:47.576
SIZE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:05:47.643 --> 01:05:49.078
TECHNOLOGY. YOU KNOW HELP ME

01:05:49.145 --> 01:05:50.546
UNDERSTAND THAT DELIVER THE

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:52.315
PROPER MESSAGE TO YOU ON THIS

01:05:52.381 --> 01:05:53.649
BODY POLICYMAKERS. AND THE

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:55.618
FIRST THING BY GOD RESOUNDING

01:05:55.685 --> 01:05:57.820
FROM EVERYONE IS. NICOLE STEMS

01:05:57.887 --> 01:06:00.723
NOT JUST FOR IT IS NOT JUST FOR

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:03.225
COMPUTER SCIENCE STEM IS LIKE

01:06:03.292 --> 01:06:06.062
THIS CENTRAL BUILDING BLOCKS OF

01:06:06.128 --> 01:06:08.564
BASICALLY ALL CAREERS INCLUDING

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:11.200
MANUFACTURING DEFINITELY ****

01:06:11.267 --> 01:06:12.134
ARE SAID WITH THE CONSTRUCTION

01:06:12.201 --> 01:06:15.371
TRADES. CULINARY ARTS WELL

01:06:15.438 --> 01:06:17.740
BEING- AND THE LIST GOES ON AND

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:19.342
ON SO IT IS REALLY THAT

01:06:19.408 --> 01:06:21.777
FOUNDATION IN THOSE FOUR

01:06:21.844 --> 01:06:23.212
DISCIPLINES OF SCIENCE

01:06:23.279 --> 01:06:25.848
TECHNOLOGY. ENGINEERING AND

01:06:25.915 --> 01:06:27.950
MATHEMATICS THAT REALLY HELPS

01:06:28.017 --> 01:06:29.885
THE STUDENT BUILD FROM THERE.

01:06:29.952 --> 01:06:31.087
THE SECOND POINT THAT THEY

01:06:31.153 --> 01:06:33.422
SHARED WITH ME IS THAT STEM IS

01:06:33.489 --> 01:06:38.160
SYNONYMOUS WITH C. T. E. WORD.

01:06:38.227 --> 01:06:39.095
ABOUT HOW DO WE BETTER DELAY

01:06:39.161 --> 01:06:40.529
THIS DO WE- AND RETAIN INTEREST

01:06:40.596 --> 01:06:42.598
IN IT HOW DO WE GET WOMEN HOW

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:44.533
DO WE GET POPULATIONS OF COLOR

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.669
INTERESTED IN IT. IT'S THE

01:06:46.736 --> 01:06:48.237
INTEGRATION WITH CAREER TECH

01:06:48.304 --> 01:06:50.339
EDUCATION BECAUSE CAREER TECH

01:06:50.406 --> 01:06:52.942
EDUCATION BRINGS THAT DIED-

01:06:53.008 --> 01:06:55.811
WORK BASED LEARNING AND THAT

01:06:55.878 --> 01:06:57.446
RELEVANCY TO THE EDUCATION

01:06:57.513 --> 01:06:59.415
EXPERIENCE AND STAMMER BRINGS

01:06:59.482 --> 01:07:01.684
THOSE DISCIPLINES AS WELL AS

01:07:01.751 --> 01:07:04.453
THE ACADEMIC. OF PHILOSOPHY IF

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.955
YOU WILL THAT'S ON TOP OF THAT

01:07:06.021 --> 01:07:07.623
AND WHEN YOU COMBINE THOSE TWO

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:09.959
YOU GET A VERY POWERFUL ON

01:07:10.025 --> 01:07:12.428
EDUCATION EXPERIENCE THAT CAN A

01:07:12.495 --> 01:07:13.996
WEEK SOMETHING LIKE IT DID WITH

01:07:14.063 --> 01:07:15.931
YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS. IN A

01:07:15.998 --> 01:07:18.100
STUDENT AND HELP CHANGE THE

01:07:18.167 --> 01:07:19.935
TRAJECTORY OF THEIR CAREER

01:07:20.002 --> 01:07:22.671
ASPIRATIONS SO THOSE ARE THE

01:07:22.738 --> 01:07:24.206
THINGS THAT IN THE

01:07:24.273 --> 01:07:26.876
MANUFACTURING COMMUNITY REALLY

01:07:26.942 --> 01:07:28.377
WANTS TO LEAVE YOU WITH IS THAT.

01:07:28.444 --> 01:07:30.446
THINK ABOUT STEM A LOT MORE

01:07:30.513 --> 01:07:32.648
BROADLY. THINK ABOUT STEM IS

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:35.184
NOT JUST AN ACADEMIC PURSUIT

01:07:35.251 --> 01:07:37.620
BUT ALSO ONE THAT INCLUDES

01:07:37.686 --> 01:07:40.022
CAREER TECH EDUCATION AND ALSO

01:07:40.089 --> 01:07:41.357
THINK ABOUT STEM IS NOT

01:07:41.424 --> 01:07:43.759
STARTING. AT FOUR YEAR

01:07:43.826 --> 01:07:46.095
UNIVERSITY AND A POST SECONDARY

01:07:46.162 --> 01:07:48.230
ENVIRONMENT THINK ABOUT STAND

01:07:48.297 --> 01:07:49.865
BEING INTEGRATED FROM THE

01:07:49.932 --> 01:07:51.600
BEGINNING OF THE EDUCATION

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:53.502
EXPERIENCE IT WAS JUST TALKED

01:07:53.569 --> 01:07:57.273
ABOUT EARLIER- ABOUT THE- KIND

01:07:57.339 --> 01:07:59.608
OF APTITUDE THAT STUDENTS ARE

01:07:59.675 --> 01:08:01.410
COMING IN TO SCHOOL WITH. I

01:08:01.477 --> 01:08:04.547
WOULD SAY THAT THERE ARE YOU

01:08:04.613 --> 01:08:07.383
KNOW CHILDREN WHO HAVEN'T EVEN

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:08.517
STEPPED INTO A CLASSROOM YET

01:08:08.584 --> 01:08:10.119
THERE ARE MORE PER SESSION IN

01:08:10.186 --> 01:08:13.022
TECHNOLOGY THEN WE ARE. YET

01:08:13.088 --> 01:08:14.457
STILL WHEN THEY GO INTO THAT

01:08:14.523 --> 01:08:17.760
CLASS ROOM IT'S NOT INTERACTIVE

01:08:17.827 --> 01:08:19.762
ANYMORE WE TAKE THE INTERACTIVE

01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:21.530
DEVICE THAT THEY PLAYED WITH

01:08:21.597 --> 01:08:23.265
WHY MOM WAS IN LINE AT THE

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:24.800
GROCERY STORE OR THEY WERE

01:08:24.867 --> 01:08:26.936
WAITING IN LINE AT DISNEYLAND.

01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:28.170
AND WE TAKE THAT AWAY FROM THEM

01:08:28.237 --> 01:08:30.940
AND WE GIVE THEM A BOOK. THAT I

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:32.475
EVEN USE THIS YOU CAN'T TOUCH

01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:33.776
THE PAPER AND GET THE

01:08:33.843 --> 01:08:35.978
DEFINITION OR GET THE REAL LIFE

VOLUNTEERS TO CREATE

01:12:59.174 --> 01:13:01.143
SUSTAINABLE CS PROGRAMS AND

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:02.511
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:13:02.578 --> 01:13:03.679
ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE

01:13:03.746 --> 01:13:04.913
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW DO YOU

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:06.248
CAN TO KICKSTART THIS

01:13:06.315 --> 01:13:08.784
CONVERSATION OUTSIDE OF THAT

01:13:08.851 --> 01:13:10.853
THE NORMATIVE CLASSROOM SETTING.

AIMED AT MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL

01:13:15.491 --> 01:13:17.259
GIRLS THIS FOCUS PRIMARY

01:13:17.326 --> 01:13:18.927
PRIMARILY ON PROVIDING STUDENTS

01:13:18.994 --> 01:13:20.596
WITH BETTER IDEAS OF WHAT A

01:13:20.662 --> 01:13:21.530
CAREER IN TECH COULD LOOK LIKE

01:13:21.597 --> 01:13:23.899
FOR WOMEN. I AND THEN PROVIDING

01:13:23.966 --> 01:13:26.201
WITH MENTORS AND- REAL LIFE

01:13:26.268 --> 01:13:27.636
EXAMPLES OF WOMEN THAT ARE IN

01:13:27.703 --> 01:13:29.772
THESE POSITIONS OF POWER SO THE

01:13:29.838 --> 01:13:30.639
GIRLS CAN EMULATE THESE

01:13:30.706 --> 01:13:32.574
INDIVIDUALS. OTHER COMPANIES

01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:34.943
SUCH AS MICROALGAE APPLE HAVE

01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:36.545
EMPHASIZED CODING AS A CREATIVE

01:13:36.612 --> 01:13:38.046
ACTIVITY THROUGH PROGRAMS LIKE

01:13:38.113 --> 01:13:40.015
EVERYONE CAN CREATE. WHICH

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:42.484
TEACHES STUDENTS. TO DEVELOP

01:13:42.551 --> 01:13:44.419
AND COMMUNICATE IDEAS. THROUGH

VIDEO PHOTOGRAPHY MUSIC AND DRY

01:13:47.289 --> 01:13:48.524
ANSWER THINKING I'M A LITTLE

01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:49.992
BIT MORE THAT CREATIVE CAPACITY

01:13:50.058 --> 01:13:51.393
BECAUSE EVERY TIME PEOPLE THINK

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:52.795
OF CS THEY THINK OF YOU KNOW

01:13:52.861 --> 01:13:54.696
HARD SCIENCE BUT- AS WE KNOW

01:13:54.763 --> 01:13:56.165
THAT YOU CAN EMBED A LOT OF

01:13:56.231 --> 01:13:57.499
CREATIVE COMPONENTS WITHIN.

01:13:57.566 --> 01:13:59.268
COMPUTER SCIENCE. APPLE IS ALSO

01:13:59.334 --> 01:14:00.636
COMMITTED TO EXCESS ABILITY

01:14:00.702 --> 01:14:01.770
ACROSS THE BOARD TO COMPUTER

01:14:01.837 --> 01:14:02.771
SCIENCE AND IS MADE MANY

01:14:02.838 --> 01:14:04.406
EFFORTS. TO MAKE CODEINE

01:14:04.473 --> 01:14:05.641
EDUCATION AVAILABLE TO BLIND

INITIATIVE. TRANSACTION PRIVATE

01:14:12.714 --> 01:14:14.216
INDUSTRY IS ONLY ONE COMPONENT

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:16.285
OF THIS- OUR INVESTMENTS IN OUR

01:14:16.351 --> 01:14:18.187
VOLUNTEERISM OR NOT THE FIX ALL

01:14:18.253 --> 01:14:19.488
SOLUTION AS WE THINK THAT THERE

01:14:19.555 --> 01:14:22.624
NEEDS TO BE. BROADER SYSTEMIC

01:14:22.691 --> 01:14:23.258
POLICY SOLUTIONS AND SEARCH FOR

01:14:23.325 --> 01:14:24.493
THIS READ TECHNO IT'S BEEN VERY

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:26.161
PROACTIVE AND COLLABORATING

01:14:26.228 --> 01:14:28.764
WITH THIS YES FOR CA COALITION.

01:14:28.831 --> 01:14:30.365
IN AS MANY OF YOU MAY BE

01:14:30.432 --> 01:14:31.366
FAMILIAR WITH THAT GROUP

01:14:31.433 --> 01:14:32.768
ALREADY. THE GOAL OF THIS

01:14:32.835 --> 01:14:35.037
PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION IS THAT

01:14:35.103 --> 01:14:36.672
EVERY STUDENT DESERVES A CS

01:14:36.738 --> 01:14:38.140
EDUCATION THAT WILL GIVE THEM

01:14:38.207 --> 01:14:40.042
AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED.

01:14:40.108 --> 01:14:41.643
REGARDLESS OF THERE'S A CODE

THE RACE GENDER AND THEIR

01:14:44.646 --> 01:14:45.147
ECONOMIC BACKGROUND. I WOULD

01:14:45.214 --> 01:14:47.583
NEED A MULTI FACETED APPROACH

01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:50.252
THAT CONTINUES TO BUILD OFF OF

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:51.553
THAT WELL IT DOWN A LOT DURING

THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY

01:16:20.442 --> 01:16:22.811
SHARED. I'M MY NAME'S JULIE

01:16:22.878 --> 01:16:25.147
FLAP AND I SAID AT THE

01:16:25.213 --> 01:16:27.215
INTERSECTION OF POLICY RESEARCH

01:16:27.282 --> 01:16:29.184
AND PRACTICE. THE LEADER OF

01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:31.420
THIS AND ARE ACCESS- UCLA

01:16:31.486 --> 01:16:32.554
COMPUTER SCIENCE EQUITY

01:16:32.621 --> 01:16:35.457
PROJECT. AND I ALSO COOLEY THE

01:16:35.524 --> 01:16:36.525
COMPUTER SCIENCE FOR

01:16:36.591 --> 01:16:39.394
CALIFORNIA. COALITION SO. I

01:16:39.461 --> 01:16:41.296
REALLY WANTED TO START WITH-

01:16:41.363 --> 01:16:42.798
WHY ARE WE HERE WHY ARE WE

01:16:42.864 --> 01:16:44.466
TALKING ABOUT COMPUTER SCIENCE

01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:45.968
WIDE IS COMPUTER SCIENCE

01:16:46.034 --> 01:16:48.170
EDUCATION MATTER. AND EVEN

01:16:48.236 --> 01:16:50.372
THOUGH I'VE LISTED THESE AS ONE

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:51.573
TWO THREE THERE CERTAINLY NOT

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:53.208
MEANT IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE

01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:56.278
BUT REALLY- THERE SO INTEGRATED

01:16:56.345 --> 01:16:58.213
AND ONE IS SOMETHING THAT WE-

01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.881
HAVE HEARD A LOT ABOUT IS THE

01:16:59.948 --> 01:17:02.317
ECONOMIC IMPERATIVE OF MEETING.

01:17:02.384 --> 01:17:04.453
THIS INCREASED DEMAND FOR

01:17:04.519 --> 01:17:07.389
SKILLED WORK FORCE. AND THAT WE

01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:09.291
ALSO NEED TO SPUR INNOVATION

01:17:09.358 --> 01:17:10.525
THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST

01:17:10.592 --> 01:17:12.394
OPPORTUNITY GAPS WHEN WE LOOK

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:14.396
AT INNOVATION OUTCOMES IS WHO

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:16.598
HOLDS PATENTS IN THIS COUNTRY.

01:17:16.665 --> 01:17:18.967
AND THEIR HUGE DISPARITIES AND

01:17:19.034 --> 01:17:21.903
SO- HOW DO WE FOSTER A SPIRIT

01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:23.872
OF INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY.

01:17:23.939 --> 01:17:27.275
SO THAT- WE HAVE MORE- CREATIVE

01:17:27.342 --> 01:17:29.211
PRODUCTS. AND THEN THE ON THE

01:17:29.277 --> 01:17:30.612
THIRD IS THE HIGH INCOME

01:17:30.679 --> 01:17:32.147
POTENTIAL WE KNOW THAT THESE

01:17:32.214 --> 01:17:35.083
ARE THE FASTEST GROWING AND

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:37.285
HIGHEST PAID JOBS. THE

01:17:37.352 --> 01:17:38.186
IMPERATIVE HAS TO DO WITH A G.

01:17:38.253 --> 01:17:39.654
AND AGAIN IT'S REALLY RELATED

01:17:39.721 --> 01:17:41.556
BUT COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION

01:17:41.623 --> 01:17:43.692
HOLDS THE PROMISE. TO PREPARE

01:17:43.759 --> 01:17:46.061
STUDENTS FOR COLLEGE CAREERS

01:17:46.128 --> 01:17:47.562
AND ALSO SOMETHING THAT GETS

01:17:47.629 --> 01:17:48.964
SHORT SHRIFT IN THESE

01:17:49.031 --> 01:17:50.932
CONVERSATIONS IS COMMUNITY

01:17:50.999 --> 01:17:53.035
ENGAGEMENT HOW DO WE ACTIVELY

01:17:53.101 --> 01:17:55.070
PARTICIPATE. IN OUR DEMOCRACY

01:17:55.137 --> 01:17:56.805
USING TECHNOLOGY AND HOW DO WE

01:17:56.872 --> 01:17:59.107
THINK CRITICALLY ABOUT HOW THAT

01:17:59.174 --> 01:18:01.977
TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED FOR

01:18:02.044 --> 01:18:04.980
GOOD- A COMPUTER SCIENCE

01:18:05.047 --> 01:18:07.582
EDUCATION ALSO HELPS IMPROVE.

01:18:07.649 --> 01:18:09.618
OUR COMPUTATIONAL THINKING

01:18:09.684 --> 01:18:11.286
CRITICAL THINKING AND

01:18:11.353 --> 01:18:13.055
COLLABORATION WHICH ARE REALLY

01:18:13.121 --> 01:18:15.524
THE FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS WHEN WE

01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:16.258
THINK ABOUT TWENTY FIRST

01:18:16.324 --> 01:18:17.959
CENTURY SKILLS FOR THE WORK

01:18:18.026 --> 01:18:21.229
FORCE. AND K. TWELVE ACCESS TO

01:18:21.296 --> 01:18:22.998
COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION IS

01:18:23.065 --> 01:18:24.766
ALSO LINKED TO CS COLLEGE

01:18:24.833 --> 01:18:26.334
MAJORS WHICH HOLDS MORE

01:18:26.401 --> 01:18:28.403
PROMISES STUDENTS FURTHER

01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:29.738
REFINE THEIR INTEREST IN

01:18:29.805 --> 01:18:33.108
COMPUTER SCIENCE. AND THE

01:18:33.175 --> 01:18:35.343
EQUITY IMPERATIVE. REALLY

01:18:35.410 --> 01:18:37.345
CONNECTS BOTH THE ECONOMIC IN

01:18:37.412 --> 01:18:39.314
THE EDUCATION IMPERATIVE AND

01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:41.149
THAT IS THAT WE NEED TO BE MORE

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:42.884
MINDFUL ABOUT HOW WE INCREASE

01:18:42.951 --> 01:18:44.920
THESE OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOW

01:18:44.986 --> 01:18:45.787
INCOME STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF

01:18:45.854 --> 01:18:48.390
COLOR- THERE'S RESEARCH FROM

01:18:48.457 --> 01:18:50.425
THE MACKENZIE- COMPANY THAT A

01:18:50.492 --> 01:18:52.527
DIVERSE WORKFORCE. ACTUALLY

01:18:52.594 --> 01:18:55.297
PRODUCES BETTER SOLUTIONS- WE

01:18:55.363 --> 01:18:57.265
ALSO NEED TO HAVE MORE VOICES

01:18:57.332 --> 01:18:59.201
AT THE TABLE IN OUR DEMOCRACY

01:18:59.267 --> 01:19:02.270
AND ALSO- IN THE PLANNING ROOM

01:19:02.337 --> 01:19:03.438
AS WE DEVELOP MORE CREATIVE

01:19:03.505 --> 01:19:06.675
PRODUCTS. AND HOW DO WE DEVOTE

01:19:06.741 --> 01:19:08.844
USE TECHNOLOGY TO SOLVE

01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:10.879
PROBLEMS IN OUR COMMUNITIES SO

01:19:10.946 --> 01:19:13.949
HOW CAN THIS INCREASED ACCESS

01:19:14.015 --> 01:19:17.886
INTERRUPT THE- THE INEQUITIES

01:19:17.953 --> 01:19:21.590
THAT WE SEE IN OUR SOCIETY. SO

01:19:21.656 --> 01:19:23.125
OFTEN TIMES WE THINK ABOUT

01:19:23.191 --> 01:19:28.230
CAREERS AND TECHNOLOGY AND- NOT

01:19:28.296 --> 01:19:29.998
WE THINK ABOUT CAREERS IN THE

01:19:30.065 --> 01:19:32.334
TECH INDUSTRY AND I THINK WE

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:33.768
WANT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL THAT

01:19:33.835 --> 01:19:35.537
WE HIGHLIGHT THAT THESE CAREERS

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:37.572
ARE MUCH BROADER THAN JUST IN

01:19:37.639 --> 01:19:39.641
THE TECH INDUSTRY. BUT COMPUTER

01:19:39.708 --> 01:19:40.909
SCIENCE KNOWLEDGE IS

01:19:40.976 --> 01:19:42.978
INCREASINGLY NEEDED WHETHER

01:19:43.044 --> 01:19:45.113
STUDENTS PURSUE WITH THE ARTS

01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:46.348
ENTERTAINMENT FINANCE HEALTH

01:19:46.414 --> 01:19:48.950
CARE AGRICULTURE AS MY

01:19:49.017 --> 01:19:50.519
COLLEAGUES NOTED ALL OF THE-

01:19:50.585 --> 01:19:51.887
INTERSECTIONS IN THE TRADES AS

01:19:51.953 --> 01:19:56.091
WELL. SO COMPUTER SCIENCE IS

01:19:56.158 --> 01:19:57.626
ACTUALLY A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY

01:19:57.692 --> 01:19:59.728
LITERACY WE'RE NOT PURSUING

01:19:59.794 --> 01:20:01.429
COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION IN

01:20:01.496 --> 01:20:02.731
THE SCHOOLS BECAUSE WE THINK

01:20:02.797 --> 01:20:03.899
EVERY STUDENT SHOULD BECOME A

01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:05.800
COMPUTER SCIENTIST JUST LIKE WE

01:20:05.867 --> 01:20:07.869
DON'T. HAVE EVERYONE STUDY

01:20:07.936 --> 01:20:09.504
BIOLOGY BECAUSE EVERYONE SHOULD

01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:11.606
BECOME A BIOLOGIST BUT THESE

01:20:11.673 --> 01:20:13.408
ARE FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS THAT WE

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:15.310
SHOULD ALL HAVE SOME EXPOSURE

01:20:15.377 --> 01:20:17.279
TO. AND SO THESE TWENTY FIRST

01:20:17.345 --> 01:20:19.281
CENTURY SKILLS CAN EASILY BE

01:20:19.347 --> 01:20:22.317
FOUND IN HIGH QUALITY COMPUTER

01:20:22.384 --> 01:20:26.321
SCIENCE EDUCATION CLASSROOMS.

01:20:26.388 --> 01:20:27.956
SO WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT

01:20:28.023 --> 01:20:29.925
THIS- THE COMPUTER SCIENCE FOR

01:20:29.991 --> 01:20:33.161
CALIFORNIA COALITION IS MADE UP

01:20:33.228 --> 01:20:34.529
OF EDUCATORS INDUSTRY

01:20:34.596 --> 01:20:37.165
ADVOCATES- NONPROFITS POLICY

01:20:37.232 --> 01:20:38.800
ADVOCATES MANY OF WHOM ARE HERE

01:20:38.867 --> 01:20:39.968
TODAY AND I'D LIKE TO THANK

01:20:40.035 --> 01:20:42.571
EVERYONE. FOR BEING HERE- WE'RE

01:20:42.637 --> 01:20:43.905
THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE TAKE

01:20:43.972 --> 01:20:45.006
ALL OF THIS INFORMATION ABOUT

01:20:45.073 --> 01:20:47.075
WHAT WE NEED TO HELP DRIVE OUR

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:49.277
ECONOMY TO HELP INCREASE EQUITY

01:20:49.344 --> 01:20:51.646
IN EDUCATION. AND HOW TO CREATE

01:20:51.713 --> 01:20:53.381
THAT PIPELINE IT'S NOT ENOUGH

01:20:53.448 --> 01:20:55.050
TO JUST SAY YES WERE ON BOARD

01:20:55.116 --> 01:20:57.018
WITH COMPUTER SCIENCE BUT WE

01:20:57.085 --> 01:20:58.253
NEED TO DIG A LITTLE BIT DEEPER

01:20:58.320 --> 01:20:59.554
AND SAY WHAT IS SOME OF THE

01:20:59.621 --> 01:21:01.323
UGLY STUFF BEHIND THE SCENES

01:21:01.389 --> 01:21:03.291
THAT WE HAVE TO UNPACK. IN

01:21:03.358 --> 01:21:05.660
ORDER TO PRIORITIZE EQUITY AND

01:21:05.727 --> 01:21:08.563
CREATE A SOLID FOUNDATIONAL

01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:10.999
STRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO OFFER

01:21:11.066 --> 01:21:12.767
HIGH QUALITY COMPUTER SCIENCE

01:21:12.834 --> 01:21:14.769
FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. AND

01:21:14.836 --> 01:21:16.738
THAT MEANS COMPUTER SCIENCE

01:21:16.805 --> 01:21:18.540
THAT PREPARES KIDS FOR COLLEGE

01:21:18.607 --> 01:21:19.941
CAREERS AND COMMUNITY

01:21:20.008 --> 01:21:21.977
ENGAGEMENT SO WE ARE WORKING

01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:24.646
WITH OUR PARTNERS- AS CAMERON

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:26.548
NOTEDWE'RE WORKING ON ISSUES

01:21:26.615 --> 01:21:27.816
AROUND TEACHER CREDENTIALING

01:21:27.882 --> 01:21:29.818
HOW DO WE PREPARE TEACHERS TO

01:21:29.884 --> 01:21:32.988
BE ABLE TO ENGAGE STUDENTS AND

01:21:33.054 --> 01:21:34.789
CURRICULUM. HOW DO THEY

01:21:34.856 --> 01:21:37.626
LEVERAGE- THAT PHONE THE

01:21:37.692 --> 01:21:38.994
CURRENCY THAT STUDENTS ARE

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:40.462
USING IN THEIR EVERYDAY

01:21:40.528 --> 01:21:42.030
COMMUNICATION AND SAY OKAY

01:21:42.097 --> 01:21:43.632
LET'S NOT PLAY ON THE PHONE HOW

01:21:43.698 --> 01:21:45.433
DO WE PROGRAM THE PHONE HOW DO

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:47.602
WE USE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT

01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:48.770
STUDENTS ARE ENGAGED IN EVERY

01:21:48.837 --> 01:21:50.672
DAY. AND SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:52.007
ARE MEANINGFUL TO THEM IN THEIR

01:21:52.073 --> 01:21:53.708
COMMUNITIES AND SO WE'RE

01:21:53.775 --> 01:21:55.744
WORKING ON BUILDING THIS THIS

01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:57.712
INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT COMPUTER

01:21:57.779 --> 01:22:00.515
SCIENCES EQUITABLE SCALABLE AND

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:02.450
SUSTAINABLE AND WE APPRECIATE

01:22:02.517 --> 01:22:04.052

TO OPEN- THE- BACK UP TO THE

01:22:12.227 --> 01:22:13.628
COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OF

01:22:13.695 --> 01:22:17.332
ALL THE FOUR SPEAKERS- THAT

01:22:17.399 --> 01:22:21.970
WERE ON THIS PANEL. IF ANYONE.

JOINING US FOR THIS REALLY

01:22:26.708 --> 01:22:28.576
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION- IT WAS

01:22:28.643 --> 01:22:29.511
GREAT TO HEAR ALL THE

01:22:29.577 --> 01:22:31.246
PERSPECTIVES. AND ALSO I THINK

01:22:31.313 --> 01:22:32.947
IT WAS GREAT TO HEAR THAT FOLKS

01:22:33.014 --> 01:22:34.382
THAT ARE PRETTINESS FROM

01:22:34.449 --> 01:22:36.518
DIFFERENT ANGLES HAVE THE SAME

01:22:36.584 --> 01:22:37.218
PERSPECTIVE IN A SHARED

01:22:37.285 --> 01:22:39.287
PERSPECTIVE. THE AS WE ALL KNOW

01:22:39.354 --> 01:22:41.289
TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGING SO MUCH

01:22:41.356 --> 01:22:43.692
OF WHAT WE DO AND HOW WE DO IT-

01:22:43.758 --> 01:22:45.460
IT MANY OF THE JOBS THAT WE'RE

01:22:45.527 --> 01:22:46.661
GONNA BE DOING IN TEN YEARS

01:22:46.728 --> 01:22:48.963
DON'T EVEN. EXIST TODAY AND

01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:50.899
AUTOMATION IS COMING FAST

01:22:50.965 --> 01:22:52.300
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS

01:22:52.367 --> 01:22:54.336
COMING FAST AND OUR TECHNOLOGY

01:22:54.402 --> 01:22:56.404
DRIVEN WORLD HOLDS BOTH A TON

01:22:56.471 --> 01:22:58.206
OF PROMISE AND ALSO A TON OF

01:22:58.273 --> 01:23:00.442
CHALLENGES AND- YEAH I THINK.

01:23:00.508 --> 01:23:01.876
WHEN WE'RE FACED WITH THAT

01:23:01.943 --> 01:23:04.279
PIECE OF CHANGE AND THAT SCOPE

01:23:04.346 --> 01:23:06.514
OF CHANGE THE RESPONSE CAN

01:23:06.581 --> 01:23:08.783
OFTEN BE FEAR. RIGHT THERE CAN

01:23:08.850 --> 01:23:11.152
BE A DESIRE TO RESIST THAT

01:23:11.219 --> 01:23:13.922
CHANGE TO TRY TO STOP IT TO

01:23:13.988 --> 01:23:15.357
LEGISLATE AGAINST IT TO. KNOW

01:23:15.423 --> 01:23:17.258
LEGISLATE AGAINST JOB LOSSES

01:23:17.325 --> 01:23:19.427
AND- I THINK WHEN WE SEE THAT

01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:21.363
FEAR RESPONSE WHEN WE'RE ACTING

01:23:21.429 --> 01:23:22.530
FOR A PLACE OF FEAR. WE MISSED

01:23:22.597 --> 01:23:24.899
OPPORTUNITIES SAYS MY QUESTION

01:23:24.966 --> 01:23:28.103
FOR EVERYONE IS. HOW CAN WE-

01:23:28.169 --> 01:23:29.938
BECAUSE HOW CAN WE HELP MOVE

01:23:30.004 --> 01:23:31.573
FROM AS A REACTION OF FEAR AND

01:23:31.639 --> 01:23:33.875
HELP PEOPLE. APPROACH THIS

01:23:33.942 --> 01:23:36.444
CHALLENGE THESE OPPORTUNITIES

01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:38.813
WITH A VIEW THAT SAYS. LET'S

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:40.515
ENSURE THAT WE'RE PLANNING FOR

01:23:40.582 --> 01:23:41.583
THIS FUTURE LET'S ENSURE THAT

01:23:41.649 --> 01:23:43.017
WERE BEING THOUGHTFUL AS WERE

01:23:43.084 --> 01:23:45.019
PLANNING. AND LET'S ENSURE THAT

01:23:45.086 --> 01:23:46.187
WE ARE CREATING AS MUCH

01:23:46.254 --> 01:23:47.889
OPPORTUNITY AS POSSIBLE FOR ALL

01:23:47.956 --> 01:23:50.458
THE EXTRA RISE AS SAD. AS AS

01:23:50.525 --> 01:23:55.330
OUR JOB ELEGIES CHANGE. LEFT

01:23:55.397 --> 01:24:01.236
HERE FOR ME OKAY. THAT A THAT'S

01:24:01.302 --> 01:24:02.070
A QUESTION I THINK SOMETHING

01:24:02.137 --> 01:24:05.073
THAT- FOR ME I LOOK BACK AT AT

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:06.941
HISTORY THE HISTORY OF THE

01:24:07.008 --> 01:24:09.711
LABOR MOVEMENT AND- HOW

01:24:09.778 --> 01:24:10.945
APPRENTICESHIP ACTUALLY WAS

01:24:11.012 --> 01:24:14.516
CREATED AND WHAT- CONTINUES TO

01:24:14.582 --> 01:24:16.084
BE. SURE THE EXISTENCE OF

01:24:16.151 --> 01:24:19.254
UNIONS THAT WERE ORGANIZED IN

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:21.823
EIGHTEEN EIGHTY. AND THROUGH

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:22.390
DIFFERENT CHANGES IN

01:24:22.457 --> 01:24:25.293
TECHNOLOGY- THROUGH THE

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.262
INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION THROUGH.

01:24:27.328 --> 01:24:29.564
THE SORT OF YOU KNOW THE

01:24:29.631 --> 01:24:30.899
GREATEST SORT OF MANUFACTURING

01:24:30.965 --> 01:24:33.201
THE CALIFORNIA- WITH ALL THE

01:24:33.268 --> 01:24:36.604
AEROSPACE AND- YOU KNOW JUST SO

01:24:36.671 --> 01:24:38.540
MUCH HAPPENED IN CALIFORNIA

01:24:38.606 --> 01:24:40.408
THAT THAT CHANGED AND SO MANY

01:24:40.475 --> 01:24:43.378
JOBS- HAD TO BE SORT OF ADAPTED

01:24:43.445 --> 01:24:45.380
SO MANY CRAFTS. LOOKED AT THE

01:24:45.447 --> 01:24:46.981
TRAINING ANTICIPATED TO

01:24:47.048 --> 01:24:48.817
PREPARED THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE

01:24:48.883 --> 01:24:51.152
TODAY- WE HAVE THIS SO

01:24:51.219 --> 01:24:53.855
EVOLUTION THAT TAKES PLACE- IT

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:54.789
HAS TO BE AN EVOLUTION IN OUR

01:24:54.856 --> 01:24:56.124
CLASSROOMS BROSSEAU IN OUR

01:24:56.191 --> 01:24:58.059
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS BECAUSE

01:24:58.126 --> 01:24:58.960
WE ARE BUILDING THE STATE OF

01:24:59.027 --> 01:25:00.562
THE ART FACILITIES. WE HAVE A

01:25:00.628 --> 01:25:02.130
JOURNEY PERSONS THAT COME BACK

01:25:02.197 --> 01:25:03.164
AND HAVE TO RE SKILL AND

01:25:03.231 --> 01:25:05.633
RETRAIN. I THINK SO THAT IS

01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:08.169
HAPPENING- I THINK THERE'S SORT

01:25:08.236 --> 01:25:10.472
OF A GLOBAL SUGAR FEAR OF THE

01:25:10.538 --> 01:25:12.073
ACCELERATION OF HOW MUCH

01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:13.208
TECHNOLOGY IS MOVING FASTER

01:25:13.274 --> 01:25:15.310
THAN IT EVER HAS BEFORE- WHAT

01:25:15.376 --> 01:25:17.078
WE VIEW IS THAT TECHNOLOGY

01:25:17.145 --> 01:25:19.013
SHOULD BE ASSISTING PEOPLE

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:21.816
TODAY. AND ACTUALLY DO HAVE A

01:25:21.883 --> 01:25:23.017
BETTER JOB AND HAVE A BETTER

01:25:23.084 --> 01:25:25.720
QUALITY OF LIFE DOING THEIR JOB

01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:28.823
AS WELL MAING IT SAFER NOT

01:25:28.890 --> 01:25:30.992
NECESSARILY REPLACE. AND SO IF

01:25:31.059 --> 01:25:34.128
THERE IS GOING TO BE- A AN

01:25:34.195 --> 01:25:35.864
OPPORTUNITY FOR. YOU KNOW SOME

01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:38.299
KIND OF AUTOMATION THEN I LOOK

01:25:38.366 --> 01:25:40.068
AT IT WILL CAN WE THEN BUILD

01:25:40.134 --> 01:25:41.836
THE AUTOMATION MACHINES CAN WE

01:25:41.903 --> 01:25:43.705
THEN OPERATE THEM CAN WE-

01:25:43.771 --> 01:25:45.173
PROVIDE MANUFACTURING

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:47.141
FACILITIES HERE TO KINDA.

01:25:47.208 --> 01:25:49.377
OFFSET WHAT COULD BE A

01:25:49.444 --> 01:25:51.513
REPLACEMENT OF SOME WORK SO

01:25:51.579 --> 01:25:53.381
THAT THERE IS NO LEAKAGE-

01:25:53.448 --> 01:25:54.716
PARTICULAR BECAUSE CALIFORNIA

01:25:54.782 --> 01:25:57.719
INVEST SO MUCH INTO THIS I

01:25:57.785 --> 01:25:59.387
THINK THAT. THERE'S A- GOOD

01:25:59.454 --> 01:26:00.688
SORT OF WAY TO LOOK AT

01:26:00.755 --> 01:26:02.290
EDUCATION AND HOW IT TIES TO

01:26:02.357 --> 01:26:03.958
BUSINESS HOW TO CREATE

01:26:04.025 --> 01:26:05.426
INCENTIVES FOR BUSINESS TO STAY

01:26:05.493 --> 01:26:07.595
IN CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO HOW TO

01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:08.963
REWARD THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE

01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:10.298
ACTUALLY DOING THE RIGHT THING

01:26:10.365 --> 01:26:11.566
BY HIRING WORKERS PAYING

01:26:11.633 --> 01:26:13.434
WORKERS ARE RIGHT WAGES. AND

01:26:13.501 --> 01:26:14.802
IMPROVING THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE

01:26:14.869 --> 01:26:16.571
AS WELL SO I KNOW IT'S AN

01:26:16.638 --> 01:26:18.139
ONGOING THING IT'S TIED TO

01:26:18.206 --> 01:26:20.308
OTHER ISSUES AS WELL. TIED TO

01:26:20.375 --> 01:26:22.176
CLIMATE CHANGE AND YOU KNOW

01:26:22.243 --> 01:26:22.944
WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH WITH

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:25.380
POLICIES THERE BUT- THIS IS

01:26:25.446 --> 01:26:26.714
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ONE

01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:28.850
THAT I WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE

01:26:28.917 --> 01:26:30.952
HAVING CONVERSATIONS ON. SELECT

01:26:31.019 --> 01:26:32.287
PSYCHIC. THERE'S A HUGE

01:26:32.353 --> 01:26:33.388
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO WORK

01:26:33.454 --> 01:26:34.822
TOGETHER TO UP SKILLED WORKERS

01:26:34.889 --> 01:26:36.291
AND TO CREATE NEW AND BETTER

01:26:36.357 --> 01:26:38.359
OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE

01:26:38.426 --> 01:26:40.128
ALL ACROSS THE STATE I THINK.

01:26:40.194 --> 01:26:41.396
NUYS MR DIMITRI YOU POINTED

01:26:41.462 --> 01:26:42.864
OUT. WERE ALREADY KIND OF

01:26:42.931 --> 01:26:45.333
FEELING THE BITE FOR. A JOB

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:47.068
FIRST IT'S NOT PREPARED FOR THE

01:26:47.135 --> 01:26:48.903
NEEDS OF THE MARKET WE ARE

01:26:48.970 --> 01:26:51.005
SEEING JOB GROWTH SLOW. NOT

01:26:51.072 --> 01:26:53.207
BECAUSE WERE FIRING PEOPLE NOT

01:26:53.274 --> 01:26:54.609
BECAUSE THERE'S NOT AVAILABLE

01:26:54.676 --> 01:26:56.911
JOBS THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE. ARE

01:26:56.978 --> 01:26:58.513
NOT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

01:26:58.580 --> 01:26:59.581
SKILLED WORKERS TO MEET THOSE

01:26:59.647 --> 01:27:01.349
NEEDS SO. THAT TO ME WHILE

01:27:01.416 --> 01:27:02.617
THERE'S A TON OF RISK FOR IT IN

01:27:02.684 --> 01:27:05.186
TERMS OF OUR ECONOMIC OUTLOOK.

01:27:05.253 --> 01:27:07.288
THAT TO ME SAYS THERE'S A TON

01:27:07.355 --> 01:27:09.490
OF OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO.

01:27:09.557 --> 01:27:10.725
CONTINUE TO IMPROVE PEOPLE'S

01:27:10.792 --> 01:27:13.494
LIVES TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN

IN BETTER JOBS AND ALSO TO

01:27:15.263 --> 01:27:16.698
CONTINUE TO GROW THE CALIFORNIA

01:27:16.764 --> 01:27:18.900
ECONOMY AND ENSURE WHERE. A

01:27:18.967 --> 01:27:23.638
GLOBAL LEADER. ASSEMBLYMEMBER I

01:27:23.705 --> 01:27:25.206
HAD A QUESTION FOR CISAR I

01:27:25.273 --> 01:27:26.140
THOUGHT YOUR COMMENTS ON

01:27:26.207 --> 01:27:28.076
APPRENTICESHIP WERE 1100% SPOT

01:27:28.142 --> 01:27:31.813
ON. I THINK WE NEED MORE

01:27:31.879 --> 01:27:32.280
FRIENDSHIPS AND MORE

01:27:32.347 --> 01:27:34.248
INTERNSHIPS BECAUSE WE CAN USE

01:27:34.315 --> 01:27:36.484
THOSE TOOLS TO TAKE A LARGE

01:27:36.551 --> 01:27:38.319
POOLS OF PEOPLE AND IDENTIFY

01:27:38.386 --> 01:27:41.055
THE ONES THAT US. A CAREER IN

01:27:41.122 --> 01:27:42.590
COMPUTER SCIENCE IS APPROPRIATE

01:27:42.657 --> 01:27:43.391
FOR AND GIVE THEM THEIR

01:27:43.458 --> 01:27:44.759
OPPORTUNITY WHERE AS YOU KNOW

01:27:44.826 --> 01:27:45.627
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE THAT

01:27:45.693 --> 01:27:46.995
OPPORTUNITY IN OTHER SETTINGS

01:27:47.061 --> 01:27:48.730
BUT THERE'S SOME UNIQUE LEGAL

01:27:48.796 --> 01:27:52.934
CHALLENGES. IN CODING THAT MAKE

01:27:53.001 --> 01:27:54.302
APPRENTICESHIPS INTERNSHIPS

01:27:54.369 --> 01:27:55.637
MORE DIFFICULT I WANTED I WANT

01:27:55.703 --> 01:27:56.371
TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT

01:27:56.437 --> 01:27:58.573
BECAUSE- I MEAN WE ADVICE DID

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:01.009
YOU USED TO HAVE INTERNSHIPS.

01:28:01.075 --> 01:28:01.776
AND WE HAD TO STOP DOING THEM

01:28:01.843 --> 01:28:03.778
BECAUSE- WHEN YOU'RE CREATING

01:28:03.845 --> 01:28:06.447
SOFTWARE- THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:28:06.514 --> 01:28:07.348
CODING ARE CREATING

01:28:07.415 --> 01:28:08.783
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND YOU

01:28:08.850 --> 01:28:10.718
NEED A CLEAR CHAIN OF OWNERSHIP

01:28:10.785 --> 01:28:12.186
FOR THAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

01:28:12.253 --> 01:28:12.787
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE CREATING A

01:28:12.854 --> 01:28:14.422
SOFTWARE FOR A CUSTOMER. YOU

01:28:14.489 --> 01:28:15.556
HAVE TO WARRANT TO THEM THAT

01:28:15.623 --> 01:28:16.758
YOU HAVE COMPLETE OWNERSHIP OF

01:28:16.824 --> 01:28:17.225
EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE

01:28:17.291 --> 01:28:18.660
DEVELOPING FOR THEM AND IF

01:28:18.726 --> 01:28:19.594
YOU'RE CREATING A FOR AN END

01:28:19.661 --> 01:28:21.696
USER- IF YOU CAN'T YOU COULD

01:28:21.763 --> 01:28:22.864
OPEN UP YOU KNOW THIS THIS

01:28:22.930 --> 01:28:24.232
PRODUCT THAT YOU INVESTED TENS

01:28:24.298 --> 01:28:24.932
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:28:24.999 --> 01:28:26.401
DEVELOPING- TO BEING PULLED OFF

01:28:26.467 --> 01:28:28.736
THE MARKET IF ONE- CLAIM OF. OF

01:28:28.803 --> 01:28:30.371
INFRINGEMENT WE WERE TO COME UP

01:28:30.438 --> 01:28:31.839
SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU

01:28:31.906 --> 01:28:33.007
HAVE THIS CHAIN OF OWNERSHIP SO

01:28:33.074 --> 01:28:34.308
THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THAT DO

01:28:34.375 --> 01:28:36.144
CODING. YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:28:36.210 --> 01:28:37.111
THAT THAT'S A WORK MADE FOR

01:28:37.178 --> 01:28:38.880
HIRE AND IT'S CLEAR THAT YOU

01:28:38.946 --> 01:28:40.081
THAT YOU'RE PAYING THEM AND

01:28:40.148 --> 01:28:41.783
EXCHANGE FOR A FAIR WAGE

01:28:41.849 --> 01:28:42.984
THEY'RE GIVING YOU THERE THE

01:28:43.051 --> 01:28:44.819
PRODUCT OF THEIR WORK AND I

01:28:44.886 --> 01:28:45.586
MEAN THE PROBLEM WITH

01:28:45.653 --> 01:28:46.120
INTERNSHIP OR THEY'RE NOT

01:28:46.187 --> 01:28:47.755
GETTING PAID OR PARTNERSHIP FOR

01:28:47.822 --> 01:28:48.723
SOMEBODY ELSE IS PAYING ON

01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:49.991
THEM. THIS YOU DON'T HAVE THAT

01:28:50.058 --> 01:28:51.225
CLEAR CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP SO I

01:28:51.292 --> 01:28:52.093
WONDERED IF YOU HAVE SOME

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.529
THOUGHTS ON ON. YOU KNOW MAYBE

01:28:54.595 --> 01:28:56.164
SOME CHANGES WE CAN MATER TOOLS

01:28:56.230 --> 01:28:57.298
THAT WE CAN USE TO OVERCOME

01:28:57.365 --> 01:28:58.866
THOSE DIFFICULTIES AND EXPAND

01:28:58.933 --> 01:29:00.768
THOSE PROGRAMS. I THINK YOU

01:29:00.835 --> 01:29:03.771
STOP ME ON THAT ONE I MEAN.

01:29:03.838 --> 01:29:06.140
THAT'S A- HI I HAVE. YOUR

01:29:06.207 --> 01:29:07.408
COMMON I I'D I'D I DO THINK. A

01:29:07.475 --> 01:29:08.443
PARTNERSHIP CAN BE USE A

01:29:08.509 --> 01:29:09.811
NONTRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES I

01:29:09.877 --> 01:29:11.679
THINK THERE'S A- CLEAR PATH

01:29:11.746 --> 01:29:13.915
TOWARD PREPARATION TO. OPEN IT

01:29:13.981 --> 01:29:16.751
UP FOR DIVERSITY AND JUST. YOU

01:29:16.818 --> 01:29:17.885
BRING PEOPLE WHEN THEY DON'T

01:29:17.952 --> 01:29:19.687
HAVE THE- ACCESS TO A LOT OF

01:29:19.754 --> 01:29:21.589
THESE RESOURCES BUT- BUT WHAT

01:29:21.656 --> 01:29:23.091
YOU'RE MENTIONING THERE- I'M

01:29:23.157 --> 01:29:24.325
NOT SURE BUT IT IS NOT REALLY

01:29:24.392 --> 01:29:25.259
SOMETHING THAT IS IN

01:29:25.326 --> 01:29:26.427
CONSTRUCTION. RIGHT IN

01:29:26.494 --> 01:29:28.196
CONSTRUCTION WE HAVE. HERE'S

01:29:28.262 --> 01:29:29.731
THE BASIC ENTRY WAY WHAT WE

01:29:29.797 --> 01:29:30.832
WILL BE DONE WITH UP FOR

01:29:30.898 --> 01:29:32.533
EXAMPLE IS PRE APPRENTICESHIP.

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:33.601
WE DEVELOPED A PRE

01:29:33.668 --> 01:29:35.136
APPRENTICESHIP CURRICULUM AT

01:29:35.203 --> 01:29:37.238
THE NATIONAL LEVEL ALL THE-

01:29:37.305 --> 01:29:38.339
INTERNATIONAL UNIONS GOT

01:29:38.406 --> 01:29:39.574
TOGETHER AND SAID THIS IS WHAT

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:42.110
WOULD. PREPARE A STUDENT. TO

01:29:42.176 --> 01:29:42.977
ACTUALLY KNOW ABOUT

01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:44.545
CONSTRUCTION GET THE REMEDIAL

01:29:44.612 --> 01:29:45.747
HELP THEM GET THEIR GED IF

01:29:45.813 --> 01:29:46.547
THEY'RE NOT HAVING THEIR

01:29:46.614 --> 01:29:48.516
DIPLOMA. GET THEM PREPARED WITH

01:29:48.583 --> 01:29:49.851
A BASIC LEVEL MASS IN THE SOFT

01:29:49.917 --> 01:29:51.519
SKILLS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO.

01:29:51.586 --> 01:29:52.987
HAVE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO

01:29:53.054 --> 01:29:54.455
ACTUALLY APPLY FOR. AND GET AN

01:29:54.522 --> 01:29:56.324
APPRENTICESHIP. AND THAT'S

01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.991
CALLED THE MULTI CROP CORE

01:29:57.058 --> 01:29:58.826
CURRICULUM. AND SO A STUDENT

01:29:58.893 --> 01:30:00.495
GOES TO THIS PROGRAM. AND THEY

01:30:00.561 --> 01:30:01.896
LEARN ALL THE ASPECTS OF ALL

01:30:01.963 --> 01:30:03.831
THE TRAITS. RIGHT EVERY SINGLE

01:30:03.898 --> 01:30:05.533
ONE OF THEM. SO THAT WHEN THEY-

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:06.901
ACTUALLY GET THE CERTIFICATE

01:30:06.968 --> 01:30:08.936
AFTER SIX MONTHS OR PROGRAM.

01:30:09.003 --> 01:30:10.705
AND THE I EVEN DO EXERCISE AND

01:30:10.772 --> 01:30:12.073
PHYSICAL SORT OF ACTIVITIES TO

01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:13.241
GET THEMSELVES KIND OF. MINE

01:30:13.307 --> 01:30:14.976
BECAUSE IT'S A VERY PHYSICAL

01:30:15.042 --> 01:30:17.044
JOB AS WELL. AND SO WHEN THEY

01:30:17.111 --> 01:30:19.046
GRADUATE FROM THIS PROGRAM. THE

01:30:19.113 --> 01:30:20.748
THAN CAN LOOK AT WHERE THE NEED

01:30:20.815 --> 01:30:22.250
IS. SO IF THERE'S US OVER

01:30:22.316 --> 01:30:24.585
SATURATION OF THE LABORERS OR

01:30:24.652 --> 01:30:26.254
THERE'S OVERSATURATION OF IRON

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:27.188
WORKERS AND THEY'RE NOT

01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:29.724
ACCEPTING. THEY CAN LOOK AT

01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:30.691
ELECTRICIAN'S PROGRAMS SHEET

01:30:30.758 --> 01:30:32.093
METAL PROGRAMS PLUMBERS AND

ACTUALLY HAVE AN INTEREST AND-

01:30:37.298 --> 01:30:38.866
AND THEY STILL HAVE THAT SHOT.

01:30:38.933 --> 01:30:41.803
IF THERE IS A WAY. TO SORT OF

01:30:41.869 --> 01:30:44.238
HAVE A BASE. TYPE OF ACCESS.

01:30:44.305 --> 01:30:45.907
WORDS NOT PROPRIETARY THIS

01:30:45.973 --> 01:30:47.909
NURSE NO SORT OF LICENSING

01:30:47.975 --> 01:30:49.844
ISSUES OR- YOU KNOW.

01:30:49.911 --> 01:30:51.846
INFRINGEMENT ON SOME COPYRIGHT

01:30:51.913 --> 01:30:53.181
I DON'T KNOW MAYBE THEY COULD

01:30:53.247 --> 01:30:55.449
BE SOME BASE WHERE A LOT OF

01:30:55.516 --> 01:30:56.284
COMPANIES CAN GET TOGETHER. AND

01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:58.019
SAY WE CAN PROVIDE THIS AS AN

01:30:58.085 --> 01:30:59.053
APPRENTICESHIP WERE

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.955
PREPARATION. AND THEN ONCE YOU

01:31:01.022 --> 01:31:04.158
GET THEM INTO YOUR ACTUAL

01:31:04.225 --> 01:31:07.195
COMPANY. THE. AND YOU CAN

01:31:07.261 --> 01:31:07.829
BECOME A FULL FLEDGED. THAT YOU

01:31:07.895 --> 01:31:09.163
CAN. SHARE WITH ANYBODY ELSE.

01:31:09.230 --> 01:31:10.631
IT WOULD NOT BE. OUR MODEL.

01:31:10.698 --> 01:31:12.800
IT'S MULTI EMPLOYER. AND WE GO

01:31:12.867 --> 01:31:14.836
WE FINISH THE JOB AND WE GO TO

01:31:14.902 --> 01:31:16.137
THE NEXT CONTRACTOR AND SO ON

01:31:16.204 --> 01:31:17.772
IN THE NEXT PROJECT. BUT IT

01:31:17.839 --> 01:31:18.940
COULD BE VERY WELL THAT THEY

01:31:19.006 --> 01:31:20.741
GET HIRED AS AN APPRENTIC AND

01:31:20.808 --> 01:31:21.742
THEN THEY STAY WITH THAT

01:31:21.809 --> 01:31:23.277
COMPANY AS A AS A SINGLE

01:31:23.344 --> 01:31:24.879
EMPLOYER WHILE I UNDERSTAND.

01:31:24.946 --> 01:31:26.013
THE PROBLEM IS NOT ONE OF

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:27.315
CONFIDENTIALITY I MEAN TO BE

01:31:27.381 --> 01:31:28.449
FINE FOR A FURNACE TO WORK FOR

01:31:28.516 --> 01:31:30.017
MULTIPLE EMPLOYERS. IT'S JUST

01:31:30.084 --> 01:31:31.586
THAT YOU NEED TO BE ABSOLUTELY

01:31:31.652 --> 01:31:33.154
SURE FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT

01:31:33.221 --> 01:31:35.022
THAT WHEN YOU PRESS RIGHTS THE

01:31:35.089 --> 01:31:36.290
LINE OF CODE. THAT ACTUALLY

01:31:36.357 --> 01:31:37.291
MAKES IT INTO A FINISHED

01:31:37.358 --> 01:31:39.193
PRODUCT. THAT THE CHANGE OF

01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:41.629
OWNERSHIP IS THERE TO BE ABLE

01:31:41.696 --> 01:31:43.364
TO WARRANT TO THE CUSTOMER.

01:31:43.431 --> 01:31:44.899
THAT THEY OWN THE PRODUCT THAT

01:31:44.966 --> 01:31:45.967
WAS CREATED SO IT SOUNDS LIKE

01:31:46.033 --> 01:31:48.069
MAYBE ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS NEED

01:31:48.135 --> 01:31:49.503
TO SIT DOWN. AND MAYBE HASH

01:31:49.570 --> 01:31:50.605
THIS OUT TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT

01:31:50.671 --> 01:31:51.839
IF THERE'S SOMETHING A LEGAL A

01:31:51.906 --> 01:31:53.040
SAFE HAVEN THE NEEDS TO BE

01:31:53.107 --> 01:31:54.442
CREATED OR- OR SOMETHING

01:31:54.508 --> 01:31:56.077
BECAUSE- I THINK WE'RE ALL IN

01:31:56.143 --> 01:31:57.011
AGREEMENT THAT THE-

01:31:57.078 --> 01:31:58.045
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND

01:31:58.112 --> 01:32:00.314
INTERNSHIPS ARE GOOD THING. BUT

01:32:00.381 --> 01:32:02.183
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:05.186
CARE BE BACK ON THAT I THINK

01:32:05.253 --> 01:32:06.754
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE TYPES

01:32:06.821 --> 01:32:07.755
OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS

01:32:07.822 --> 01:32:09.991
IN CALIFORNIA WE- LOOK AT.

01:32:10.057 --> 01:32:11.592
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND ON

01:32:11.659 --> 01:32:12.860
THE JOB TRAINING AS BEING

01:32:12.927 --> 01:32:14.795
SYNONYMOUS AND- A BRIDGE A

01:32:14.862 --> 01:32:16.964
PROGRAM IS JUST ONE. OPTION OF

01:32:17.031 --> 01:32:18.699
AN ON THE JOB TRAINING PROGRAM

01:32:18.766 --> 01:32:20.902
SO. PERHAPS THE WAY TO DEAL

01:32:20.968 --> 01:32:22.870
WITH SOME OF THESE UNIQUE MRS

01:32:22.937 --> 01:32:24.038
THAT MAKE OTHER INDUSTRIES

01:32:24.105 --> 01:32:25.106
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT.

01:32:25.172 --> 01:32:26.340
CONSTRUCTION TRADES HAVE BEEN

01:32:26.407 --> 01:32:28.442
ABLE TO BILL SUCCESSFULLY. IS

01:32:28.509 --> 01:32:30.111
TO LOOK AT OTHER ON THE JOB

01:32:30.177 --> 01:32:31.979
TRAINING MODELS. THAT MIGHT BE

01:32:32.046 --> 01:32:33.214
DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT FROM

01:32:33.281 --> 01:32:34.782
EACH OTHER IN DIFFERENT

01:32:34.849 --> 01:32:37.084
INDUSTRIES. BUT BE ABLE TO

01:32:37.151 --> 01:32:39.153
CREATE SOMETHING. THAT CREATES

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:40.454
THE SAME BENEFITS AS AN

01:32:40.521 --> 01:32:42.556
APPRENTICESHIP MODEL BUT ISN'T.

01:32:42.623 --> 01:32:44.258
TRYING TO STICK THAT ROUND PEG

01:32:44.325 --> 01:32:46.193
INTO THAT SQUARE HOLE. TO BE

01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:46.761
ABLE TO MEET SOME OF THOSE

01:32:46.827 --> 01:32:48.296
CHALLENGES. YEAH AND THAT'S

01:32:48.362 --> 01:32:49.530
WHAT WE'VE DONE IN MY STUDIO WE

01:32:49.597 --> 01:32:51.432
DON'T HAVE INTERNSHIPS ANYMORE-

01:32:51.499 --> 01:32:53.167
WE HAVE. A PROVISIONL

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:55.803
EMPLOYEES. RIGHT AND SO WE ARE

01:32:55.870 --> 01:32:57.238
YOU KNOW BUT BUT WE HAVE FEWER

01:32:57.305 --> 01:32:58.606
OF THEM THAN WE USED TO HAVE OF

01:32:58.673 --> 01:33:00.641
INTERNS. SO IT'S HARDER TO GET

01:33:00.708 --> 01:33:01.876
THAT. LEG UP YOU KNOW THAT

01:33:01.943 --> 01:33:03.577
FIRST STEP. WHICH IS WHICH IS A

01:33:03.644 --> 01:33:05.646
SHAME BECAUSE- YOU KNOW YOU

01:33:05.713 --> 01:33:06.180
REALLY YOU THINK ABOUT THE

01:33:06.247 --> 01:33:08.215
PERSON. YOU KNOW. MAYBE FROM A

01:33:08.282 --> 01:33:09.583
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY MAYBE

01:33:09.650 --> 01:33:10.851
FROM AN UNDERREPRESENTED.

01:33:10.918 --> 01:33:12.586
ETHNICITY THAT YOU KNOW JUST

01:33:12.653 --> 01:33:15.923
NEEDS THAT SHOT. YEP ANYWAY

01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:17.725
THANK YOU. SO THE SOUNDS LIKE A

01:33:17.792 --> 01:33:20.127
GREAT. ISSUE WHICH IS OUR GOAL-

01:33:20.194 --> 01:33:21.295
OF THIS SELECT COMMITTEE

01:33:21.362 --> 01:33:23.364
HEARING AND I LOOK FORWARD TO

01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:24.865
WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU. ON

01:33:24.932 --> 01:33:26.434
THIS I MEAN I THINK ESPECIALLY

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:28.336
THE APPRENTICESHIP MODEL WHILE.

01:33:28.402 --> 01:33:29.904
IT WILL BE EXACTLY THE SAME AS

01:33:29.971 --> 01:33:31.172
IT IS IN THE CONSTRUCTION

01:33:31.238 --> 01:33:32.540
TRADES I THINK THERE'S A LOT

01:33:32.606 --> 01:33:35.076
THAT WE CAN LEARN- FROM YOU'VE

01:33:35.142 --> 01:33:37.178
BEEN SUCCESSFUL. STATE WIDE AND

01:33:37.244 --> 01:33:39.814
DIVERSE COMMUNITIES OF YOU KNOW

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:42.183
YOU HAVE. YOU KNOW

01:33:42.249 --> 01:33:43.451
REPRESENTATION FROM. OF LOTS OF

01:33:43.517 --> 01:33:46.520
PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S

01:33:46.587 --> 01:33:47.888
WE TALK ABOUT COMPUTER SCIENCE

01:33:47.955 --> 01:33:49.991
AND THE NEED FOR THAT-

01:33:50.057 --> 01:33:53.060
INCREASING- ACCESS AND EQUITY.

01:33:53.127 --> 01:33:55.029
AND SO THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT

01:33:55.096 --> 01:33:57.031
THIS MODEL AND I THINK

01:33:57.098 --> 01:33:59.633
EVERYONE. IN THIS ROOM. ARE

01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:00.835
THESE ARE THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT

01:34:00.901 --> 01:34:03.037
NEED TO DISCUSS IT SO. I THINK

01:34:03.104 --> 01:34:05.239
WE CAN- IN THE FUTURE MOVE

01:34:05.306 --> 01:34:07.375
FORWARD- JUST FOCUSED ON THAT

01:34:07.441 --> 01:34:08.409
AND HOW THAT CAN BE A

01:34:08.476 --> 01:34:10.745
SUCCESSFUL MODEL- YOU KNOW ONE

01:34:10.811 --> 01:34:13.748
THING I THINK ABOUT. THE WITH

01:34:13.814 --> 01:34:15.750
WITH MR DIMITRI THE OTHER

01:34:15.816 --> 01:34:17.785
SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

01:34:17.852 --> 01:34:19.020
THAT ARE THE CLOSEST TO THESE

01:34:19.086 --> 01:34:21.188
TECH HUBS THAT SEEM TO GET A

01:34:21.255 --> 01:34:22.656
LOT OF THE RESOURCE SAYS FROM

01:34:22.723 --> 01:34:26.627
OUR- CORPORATE CORPORATIONS-

01:34:26.694 --> 01:34:28.796
BUT- YOU KNOW IN PETERS SCIENCE

01:34:28.863 --> 01:34:30.998
LIKE. REALLY MENTIONED IS EVERY

01:34:31.065 --> 01:34:31.799
IN A LT OF DIFFERENT

01:34:31.866 --> 01:34:36.670
INDUSTRIES- SO WHAT CAN WE DO-

01:34:36.737 --> 01:34:38.806
TO YOU KNOW REACH- COMMUNITIES

01:34:38.873 --> 01:34:40.741
ARE NOT CLOSE TO THESE TACK

01:34:40.808 --> 01:34:43.110
HOBBS- OR IS THE INDUSTRY

01:34:43.177 --> 01:34:45.980
WORKING ON THAT. YEAH AND BE

01:34:46.047 --> 01:34:48.015
HAPPY TO ANSWER IT SO. YES I

01:34:48.082 --> 01:34:49.050
MEAN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:34:49.116 --> 01:34:50.651
WE'RE VERY ENGAGED AND I THINK

01:34:50.718 --> 01:34:52.319
THROUGHOUT THE STATE THINKING

01:34:52.386 --> 01:34:53.954
ABOUT COMMUNITIES LIKE THE

01:34:54.021 --> 01:34:54.688
CENTRAL VALLEY WHICH MAY BE

01:34:54.755 --> 01:34:55.823
DON'T NECESSARILY GET THE KIND

01:34:55.890 --> 01:34:58.159
OF ATTENTION THAT- YOU KNOW

01:34:58.225 --> 01:34:59.260
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE SILICON

01:34:59.326 --> 01:35:00.961
VALLEY AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE

01:35:01.028 --> 01:35:03.497
NEARBY AREAS DOES GET. SO I

01:35:03.564 --> 01:35:05.232
THINK ONE OF THE REASONS THAT

01:35:05.299 --> 01:35:06.500
WE'VE BEEN REALLY PROACTIVE

01:35:06.567 --> 01:35:08.035
WITH IN THE CS FOR CA

01:35:08.102 --> 01:35:09.437
COLLECTIONS BECAUSE WE SEE ONE

01:35:09.503 --> 01:35:11.072
WAY IS TO ACTUALLY YOU KNOW

01:35:11.138 --> 01:35:12.139
BUILD OUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:35:12.206 --> 01:35:13.774
WITHIN THE PRE EXISTING SCHOOLS

01:35:13.841 --> 01:35:15.209
IN THOSE COMMUNITIES TO GIVE

01:35:15.276 --> 01:35:16.911
THEM THE TEACHERS THE SKILL

01:35:16.977 --> 01:35:18.846
SETS THAT ARE NEEDED TO

01:35:18.913 --> 01:35:20.247
ACTUALLY. BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

01:35:20.314 --> 01:35:22.216
THAT HI REGULAR OF COURSE WORK

01:35:22.283 --> 01:35:23.317
THAT IS NEEDED IN COMPUTER

01:35:23.384 --> 01:35:24.819
SCIENCE WHICH IS SOMETHING THE

01:35:24.885 --> 01:35:26.554
RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE. WE'RE

01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:28.622
NOT SEEN AND SO THOS CLASS THE

01:35:28.689 --> 01:35:30.124
SCHOOLS AND LOWER INCOME

01:35:30.191 --> 01:35:31.959
COMMUNITIES AREN'T GETTING. THE

01:35:32.026 --> 01:35:33.494
KIND OF EDUCATION THAT THEY

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:36.397
NEED IN THE STUDENTS ARE ARE.

01:35:36.464 --> 01:35:39.300
KIND OF. THREE THERE AT THE GAP

01:35:39.366 --> 01:35:41.001
AND OF THAT AND SO WHAT WE WANT

01:35:41.068 --> 01:35:41.836
TO DO IS BE ABLE TO HELP

01:35:41.902 --> 01:35:43.804
MITIGATE THAT DO PROVIDING

01:35:43.871 --> 01:35:46.340
BETTER TEACHER PREPARATION- AND

01:35:46.407 --> 01:35:48.008
MORE COURSEWORK AVAILABLE IN

01:35:48.075 --> 01:35:50.010
THOSE AREAS AND THEN FROM WHAT

01:35:50.077 --> 01:35:51.912
I'VE SEEN AND DOUBTS THAT OUR

01:35:51.979 --> 01:35:53.147
COMPANIES ARE VERY ENGAGE

01:35:53.214 --> 01:35:54.515
WITHIN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND

01:35:54.582 --> 01:35:55.583
NOT JUST IN THE SO CALLED

01:35:55.649 --> 01:35:58.619
pBUT IF THERE'S WAYS THAT YOU

01:35:58.686 --> 01:35:59.720
KNOW THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO

01:35:59.787 --> 01:36:01.589
PARTNER IN THOSE COMMUNITIES

01:36:01.655 --> 01:36:03.124
MORE AND MORE AND BUILD IN

01:36:03.190 --> 01:36:06.327
THOSE- FOOT PRINTS NO WE'D BE

I'VE DONE SOMETHING LIKE THIS

01:37:30.144 --> 01:37:32.146
IN CALIFORNIA DONE IT

01:37:32.213 --> 01:37:34.248

THAT HAS BEEN DONE BY LOT OF-

01:37:46.193 --> 01:37:49.263
INSTITUTIONS. TO ORGANIZATIONS

01:37:49.330 --> 01:37:51.899
TO GET MORE ACCESS TO COMPUTER%

01:37:51.966 --> 01:37:54.101
SCIENCE IN CASE WHO TWELVE. BUT

01:37:54.168 --> 01:37:55.603
FOR MY PURSE. OR AND FROM MY

01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:57.104
PERSPECTIVE AND I SPENT A LOT

01:37:57.171 --> 01:37:58.639
OF TIME DOING THAT AS WELL

01:37:58.706 --> 01:38:01.909
THROUGHOUT MY CAREER. THE POINT

01:38:01.976 --> 01:38:04.178
I WANT TO MAKE IS. IT'S NOT TOO

01:38:04.245 --> 01:38:05.512
LATE TO START IT FIRST YEAR

01:38:05.579 --> 01:38:08.916
UNIVERSITY. AND IN PARTICULAR

01:38:08.983 --> 01:38:11.418
THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO

01:38:11.485 --> 01:38:13.787
ENDED UP MAJORING UP OVER THE

01:38:13.854 --> 01:38:14.888
TIME I'VE BEEN OF MUD IN

01:38:14.955 --> 01:38:16.624
COMPUTER SCIENCE WERE FEMALE OR

01:38:16.690 --> 01:38:19.426
A PERSON OF COLOR DID NOT HAVE

01:38:19.493 --> 01:38:19.994
ANY COMPUTER SCIENCE BEFORE

01:38:20.060 --> 01:38:23.063
THEY GOT THERE. AND IN FACT- I

01:38:23.130 --> 01:38:25.733
WAS VERY LUCKY SO. WHEN I

01:38:25.799 --> 01:38:28.002
ARRIVED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THE

01:38:28.068 --> 01:38:29.303
COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT AT

01:38:29.370 --> 01:38:32.072
MUD HAD STARTED HAD NOTICED

01:38:32.139 --> 01:38:32.740
THEY HAD A BRAND NEW SYSTEM

01:38:32.806 --> 01:38:34.108
PROFESSOR WHO JUST FINISHED HER

01:38:34.174 --> 01:38:38.646
PHD AT MIT. CHRISTINE OF RADO

01:38:38.712 --> 01:38:40.581
AND SHE HAD NOTICED THAT THE

01:38:40.648 --> 01:38:41.982
PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN MAJOR IN

01:38:42.049 --> 01:38:43.417
COMPUTER SCIENCE AT MUD WAS

01:38:43.484 --> 01:38:46.820
ABYSMAL IT WAS ABOUT BETWEEN

01:38:46.887 --> 01:38:48.689
1015% WHICH MEANT IT WAS EITHER

01:38:48.756 --> 01:38:50.524
TWO OR THREE STUDENTS PER YEAR.

01:38:50.591 --> 01:38:54.061
AND THERE WERE OTHER PLACES-

01:38:54.128 --> 01:38:56.497
THAT HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN

01:38:56.563 --> 01:38:57.031
ATTRACTING MORE WOMEN TO

01:38:57.097 --> 01:38:59.533
COMPUTER SCIENCE- THE FIRST TO

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:01.168
DO SO WE'RE CARNEGIE MELLON.

01:39:01.235 --> 01:39:02.903
AND THE U. S. AND THE

01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:04.204
UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA

01:39:04.271 --> 01:39:05.939
AND CANADA WHICH IS WHERE I WAS

01:39:06.006 --> 01:39:07.474
AT THE TIME AND I STARTED THAT.

01:39:07.541 --> 01:39:09.476
IN SO THE DEPARTMENT DECIDED

01:39:09.543 --> 01:39:10.811
THAT THEY WERE GOING TO THINK

01:39:10.878 --> 01:39:11.945
ABOUT HOW THEY COULD CHANGE

01:39:12.012 --> 01:39:14.715
THINGS SO THAT THEY COULD RAISE

01:39:14.782 --> 01:39:16.517
THE NUMBER OF WOMEN MAJOR IN

01:39:16.583 --> 01:39:20.287
COMPUTER SCIENCE MUD. NO WITHIN

01:39:20.354 --> 01:39:24.525
FOUR YEARS WE WERE UP 240% WHAT

01:39:24.591 --> 01:39:26.093
DID THEY CHANGE THE FIRST THING

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:27.361
THE CHANGE WAS HOW THE TOP

01:39:27.428 --> 01:39:29.129
CAUGHT THE INTRODUCTORY COURSE

01:39:29.196 --> 01:39:30.964
SO J. THE INTRODUCTORY COURSE

01:39:31.031 --> 01:39:33.100
I'M ASSEMBLYMAN OBERNOLTE SORRY

01:39:33.167 --> 01:39:36.070
J. THE WAY THEY TAUGHT THE

01:39:36.136 --> 01:39:39.073
INTRODUCTORY COURSE. BEFORE SO

01:39:39.139 --> 01:39:40.274
EVERYONE WAS REQUIRED TO TAKE

01:39:40.341 --> 01:39:41.909
IT AND IT IN THE FIRST

01:39:41.975 --> 01:39:45.012
SEMESTER. SO AS YOU WERE SAYING

01:39:45.079 --> 01:39:46.480
AND IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST

01:39:46.547 --> 01:39:48.949

WITHIN THE VERY FIRST SEMESTER

01:40:34.495 --> 01:40:37.831
THAT IT WAS TAUGHT. IT BECAME

MOST POPULAR COURSE AT THE

01:40:44.405 --> 01:40:46.473
COMMON COLLEGES. SO I JUST

01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:47.441
WANNA TELL YOU I GOT THE

01:40:47.508 --> 01:40:49.910
STATISTICS YESTERDAY. SO RIGHT

01:40:49.977 --> 01:40:54.114
NOW- WE GRADUATE ABOUT SEVENTY

01:40:54.181 --> 01:40:54.681
COMPUTER SCIENCE MAJORS PER

01:40:54.748 --> 01:40:58.685
YEAR. UP ROUGHLY HALF ARE

01:40:58.752 --> 01:41:00.687
FEMALE THOSE ARE MUD STUDENTS

01:41:00.754 --> 01:41:03.323
WE ALSO GRADUATE PROBABLY FORTY

01:41:03.390 --> 01:41:05.292
TO FIFTY. YOUR SCIENCE MAJORS

01:41:05.359 --> 01:41:06.226
WHO ARE FROM THE OTHER

01:41:06.293 --> 01:41:08.228
CLAREMONT COLLEGES SOME TO GIVE

01:41:08.295 --> 01:41:09.496
YOU SOME STATISTICS OVER

01:41:09.563 --> 01:41:10.831
JUNIORS AND SENIORS MAJORING

01:41:10.898 --> 01:41:13.066
COMPUTER SCIENCE TODAY 45% OR

01:41:13.133 --> 01:41:18.005
FEMALE. FROM THE STUDENTS WERE

01:41:18.071 --> 01:41:19.206
MAJOR IN COMPUTER SCIENCE WITH

01:41:19.273 --> 01:41:23.744
OTHER COLLEGES 51% FEMALE. IF I

01:41:23.811 --> 01:41:27.514
LOOK AT RACE BECAUSE RACE IS AT

01:41:27.581 --> 01:41:29.283
LEAST AS IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF

01:41:29.349 --> 01:41:30.784
UNDER REPRESENTATION MAYBE MORE

01:41:30.851 --> 01:41:33.454
SO THAN GENDER FROM THE

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:34.755
STUDENTS WERE MAJORING IN

01:41:34.822 --> 01:41:36.723
COMPUTER SCIENCE IT'S FOUR

01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:39.793
POINT 2% AFRICAN AMERICAN

01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:41.628
SEVENTEEN POINT 7% HISPANIC.

01:41:41.695 --> 01:41:44.965
THE ZERO POINT 3% NATIVE.

01:41:45.032 --> 01:41:46.433
HAWAIIAN OR OTHER PACIFIC

01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:50.070
ISLANDER. STE TWELVE POINT 5%

01:41:50.137 --> 01:41:53.740
TWO OR MORE RACES. THE QUITE IS

01:41:53.807 --> 01:41:56.977
26% ASIAN IS 22% SO IF YOU PUT

01:41:57.044 --> 01:41:58.779
TOGETHER BLACK AND HISPANIC

01:41:58.846 --> 01:42:00.080
IT'S MORE THAN THE NUMBER OF

01:42:00.147 --> 01:42:01.982
ASIANS ARE ALMOST THE SAME AS

01:42:02.049 --> 01:42:03.217
THE NUMBER OF WHITE STUDENTS

01:42:03.283 --> 01:42:04.618
AND IF I ADD IN THE OFF CAMPUS

01:42:04.685 --> 01:42:05.819
MAJORS THE ONES WHO ARE AT THE

01:42:05.886 --> 01:42:07.621
OTHER CLAREMONT COLLEGES. IT'S

01:42:07.688 --> 01:42:09.122
ROUGHLY THE SAME NOT QUITE AS

01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:11.925
STRONG. SO THE FIRST THING I

01:42:11.992 --> 01:42:14.261
WANT TO SAY IS YOU CAN TEACH

01:42:14.328 --> 01:42:16.663
COMPUTER SCIENCE IN A WAY. THAT

01:42:16.730 --> 01:42:20.868
IS HIGHLY ATTRACTIVE MOTIVATING.

01:42:20.934 --> 01:42:22.569
TO PEOPLE WHO'VE NEVER WHO

01:42:22.636 --> 01:42:24.838
HATED COMPUTERS UNTIL THEY GOT

01:42:24.905 --> 01:42:32.312
TO COLLEGE OKAY THIS. BECAUSE

01:42:32.379 --> 01:42:34.748
NOT EVERY UNIVERSITY TEACHERS

01:42:34.815 --> 01:42:36.917
COMPUTER SCIENCE IN A WAY IN

01:42:36.984 --> 01:42:40.621
THAT INCLUSIVE WAY. THE SECOND

01:42:40.687 --> 01:42:41.588
THING I WANT TO SAY WHICH I

01:42:41.655 --> 01:42:43.423
THINK WAS TALKED ABOUT IN THE

01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:45.559
LAST PANEL IS THAT IT'S

01:42:45.626 --> 01:42:48.262
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO GIVE

01:42:48.328 --> 01:42:49.329
WOMEN AND OTHER

01:42:49.396 --> 01:42:51.198
UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS AN

01:42:51.265 --> 01:42:53.500
OPPORTUNITY TO USE THEIR

01:42:53.567 --> 01:42:54.535
KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT

01:42:54.601 --> 01:42:56.069
REALLY MOTIVATES THEM THAT'S A

01:42:56.136 --> 01:42:57.471
SPARK WHICH IS REALLY WHAT YOU

01:42:57.538 --> 01:43:01.508
WERE SAYING. AND SO WHAT WE DO

01:43:01.575 --> 01:43:04.144
IT MIND IS WE EITHER PROVIDE IN

01:43:04.211 --> 01:43:05.178
THE SUMMER AFTER THEIR FIRST

01:43:05.245 --> 01:43:07.214
YEAR WE TRY TO GET THEM EITHER

01:43:07.281 --> 01:43:09.082
INTO RESEARCH EXPERIENCE ON

01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:11.051
WORKING SO ON SOME SOCIETALLY

01:43:11.118 --> 01:43:12.753
RELEVANT THING USING COMPUTER

01:43:12.819 --> 01:43:15.656
SCIENCE OR WE HAVE WORKED WITH

01:43:15.722 --> 01:43:17.257
ALL OF THE TOP TECH COMPANIES

01:43:17.324 --> 01:43:18.525
TO START EARLY INTERNSHIP

01:43:18.592 --> 01:43:20.494
PROGRAM SO GOOGLE MICROSOFT

01:43:20.561 --> 01:43:24.731
FACEBOOK. AMAZON APPLE THEY ALL

01:43:24.798 --> 01:43:25.966
HAVE EARLY INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS

01:43:26.033 --> 01:43:28.101
NOW WHERE THEY WILL TAKE

01:43:28.168 --> 01:43:28.735
STUDENTS AS EARLY AS AFTER THE

01:43:28.802 --> 01:43:31.271
FIRST YEAR. AND GIVE THEM THAT

01:43:31.338 --> 01:43:34.374
EXPERIENCE. AND SO WHAT WE KNOW

01:43:34.441 --> 01:43:36.577
IS FROM RESEARCH IS THAT IF YOU

01:43:36.643 --> 01:43:38.845
CAN GET. WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF

01:43:38.912 --> 01:43:41.014
COLOR INTO AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:43:41.081 --> 01:43:42.716
SEE WHITE WHAT THEY'VE LEARNED

01:43:42.783 --> 01:43:44.284
CAN BE USED TO SOLVE IMPORTANT

01:43:44.351 --> 01:43:45.852
PROBLEMS. THEY STAY IN THE

01:43:45.919 --> 01:43:47.754
GRADUATE. AND THEN THE FINAL

01:43:47.821 --> 01:43:49.389
THING IS THE MAIN OUR MAJOR

01:43:49.456 --> 01:43:50.724
CHALLENGES FINDING ENOUGH

01:43:50.791 --> 01:43:51.892
COMPUTER SCIENCE INSTRUCTORS

01:43:51.959 --> 01:43:53.393
AND TRAINING THEM TO TEACH

01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:55.662

COMPUTER SCIENCE SPACE. WHAT

01:51:26.246 --> 01:51:28.048
WE'VE NOTICED AS WHEN WE'RE

01:51:28.114 --> 01:51:30.650
CONFRONTED WITH THE LACK OF

01:51:30.717 --> 01:51:31.651
GIRLS THE LACK OF DATA THAT WE

01:51:31.718 --> 01:51:33.787
HAVE FOUR. GIRLS AND PEOPLE OF

01:51:33.853 --> 01:51:35.255
COLOR IN COMPUTR SCIENCE THERE

01:51:35.321 --> 01:51:37.057
IS OFTEN A KNEE JERK REACTION

01:51:37.123 --> 01:51:38.224
TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

01:51:38.291 --> 01:51:39.859
OPPORTUNITIES IN HIGH SCHOOL.

01:51:39.926 --> 01:51:41.461
WHILE THOSE ARE VERY BENEFICIAL

01:51:41.528 --> 01:51:43.763
IN THEIR OWN RIGHT. NEW HIGH

01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:45.598
SCHOOL COURSES ALONE WILL NOT

01:51:45.665 --> 01:51:48.268
CLOSE THE GAP FOR GIRLS AND

01:51:48.334 --> 01:51:49.235
STUDENTS OF COLOR IN CALIFORNIA.

01:51:49.302 --> 01:51:50.770
STUDENTS MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT

01:51:50.837 --> 01:51:52.005
WHETHER THEY ARE GOOD AT MATH

01:51:52.072 --> 01:51:54.207
OR SCIENCE AT A VERY EARLY AGE.

01:51:54.274 --> 01:51:55.542
THINK ABOUT THE FIRST TIME YOU

01:51:55.608 --> 01:51:56.376
THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T GOOD AT

01:51:56.443 --> 01:51:58.578
SOMETHING. I KNOW IT WAS EARLY

01:51:58.645 --> 01:52:01.114
FOR ME. RESEARCH ON STUDENT AT

01:52:01.181 --> 01:52:02.615
SELF EFFICACY IN MATH AND

01:52:02.682 --> 01:52:03.783
SCIENCE THAT SHOW WAS STARTING

01:52:03.850 --> 01:52:05.885
STARTLING REALITY. GIRLS AND

01:52:05.952 --> 01:52:06.920
BOYS BEGIN SELF SELECTING OUT

01:52:06.986 --> 01:52:08.488
OF THESE SUBJECTS AS EARLY AS

01:52:08.555 --> 01:52:10.223
SECOND GRADE. IF STUDENTS

01:52:10.290 --> 01:52:11.458
ENCOUNTER COMPUTER SCIENCE FOR

01:52:11.524 --> 01:52:12.959
THE FIRST TIME IN HIGH SCHOOL.

01:52:13.026 --> 01:52:14.961
THEY OFTEN SELF SELECT OUT THEY

01:52:15.028 --> 01:52:16.763
DECIDE IT ISN'T FOR THEM

01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:18.498
WITHOUT EVEN TRYING IT. WE MUST

01:52:18.565 --> 01:52:20.533
ENGAGE STUDENTS IN COMPUTER

01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:23.536
SCIENCE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

01:52:23.603 --> 01:52:24.137
ACTUALLY WE SHOULD ENGAGE THEM

01:52:24.204 --> 01:52:26.573
IN PRE K. IMAGINE IF WE

01:52:26.639 --> 01:52:27.807
SUGGESTED THE KIDS DON'T START

01:52:27.874 --> 01:52:29.476
PLAYING BASKETBALL OR BASEBALL

01:52:29.542 --> 01:52:31.377
OR SOFTBALL UNTIL NIGHT GREAT.

01:52:31.444 --> 01:52:32.745
OR PERHAPS IN MUSIC WE WAITED

01:52:32.812 --> 01:52:33.980
UNTIL NINTH GRADE TO HAND OUT

01:52:34.047 --> 01:52:36.216
TRUMPETS OR SAXOPHONES ARE

01:52:36.282 --> 01:52:36.850
FLEETS AND THEN ATTEMPTED TO BE

01:52:36.916 --> 01:52:38.785
A MARCHING BANDS. WE KNOW THAT

01:52:38.852 --> 01:52:40.553
SUCCESS IN ATHLETICS AND MUSIC

01:52:40.620 --> 01:52:43.289
BEGINS EARLY ON SO WHY WHY ARE

01:52:43.356 --> 01:52:45.625
WE FORCING STUDENTS. TO WAIT

01:52:45.692 --> 01:52:47.293
SEE COMPUTER SCIENCE UNTIL SO

01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:49.295
LATE TO THEIR EDUCATION. TO

01:52:49.362 --> 01:52:51.498
THAT END- WE UTILIZE AND

01:52:51.564 --> 01:52:53.299
SUGGEST FOCUSING UPON THREE

01:52:53.366 --> 01:52:54.767
RESEARCH BASED FINDINGS TO FUEL

01:52:54.834 --> 01:52:55.702
AND SUSTAIN EQUITY IN COMPUTER

01:52:55.768 --> 01:52:58.338
SCIENCE FIRST COMPUTER SCIENCE

01:52:58.404 --> 01:52:59.339
TO BE INTEGRATED AS PART OF THE

01:52:59.405 --> 01:53:01.074
NORMAL CLASSROOM CURRICULUM AS

01:53:01.141 --> 01:53:02.842
EARLY AS POSSIBLE. SECONDLY

01:53:02.909 --> 01:53:04.577
COMPUTER SCIENCE SHOULD BE

01:53:04.644 --> 01:53:06.446
TAUGHT AS EARLY AS PRE K. USING

01:53:06.513 --> 01:53:07.280
DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE

01:53:07.347 --> 01:53:09.349
PRACTICES AND FINALLY COMPUTER

01:53:09.415 --> 01:53:10.817
SCIENCE TO BE TAUGHT AS PART OF

01:53:10.884 --> 01:53:12.652
A BROADER EXPOSURE TO CAREERS

01:53:12.719 --> 01:53:14.654
AND OPPORTUNITIES BEGINNING IN

01:53:14.721 --> 01:53:16.556
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. FIRST AND

01:53:16.623 --> 01:53:17.524
FOREMOST COMPUTER SCIENCE

01:53:17.590 --> 01:53:18.691
SHOULD BE INCLUDED AS PART IS

01:53:18.758 --> 01:53:20.460
THE PART OF THE OVERALL

01:53:20.527 --> 01:53:21.828
ELEMENTARY CURRICULUM AND THE

01:53:21.895 --> 01:53:23.296
REGULAR CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE.

01:53:23.363 --> 01:53:24.531
COMPUTER SCIENCE TO NOT BE A

01:53:24.597 --> 01:53:25.865
SINGLE ACTIVITY DONE ONCE A

01:53:25.932 --> 01:53:27.667
YEAR. COMPUTER SCIENCE SHOULD

01:53:27.734 --> 01:53:28.801
BE AN EXPECTED PART OF THE

01:53:28.868 --> 01:53:30.470
STUDENT EXPERIENCE EARLY ON

01:53:30.537 --> 01:53:32.038
BECAUSE IT NORMALIZES COMPUTER

01:53:32.105 --> 01:53:34.107
SCIENCE FOR ALL PREVENTING THAT

01:53:34.174 --> 01:53:35.508
NEGATIVE SELF SELECTION THAT

01:53:35.575 --> 01:53:36.643
OFTEN IMPACTS GIRLS AND

01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:38.011
STUDENTS THE COLORS. IN THEIR

01:53:38.077 --> 01:53:39.012

01:53:41.447 --> 01:53:42.782
CLASSROOM EXPERIENCES ALSO

01:53:42.849 --> 01:53:44.584
ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS NOT

01:53:44.651 --> 01:53:45.685
JUST THOSE WITH ACCESS TO

01:53:45.752 --> 01:53:47.320
COMPUTERS AT HOME EXPERIENCE

01:53:47.387 --> 01:53:49.422
COMPUTER SCIENCE. EARLY

01:53:49.489 --> 01:53:50.924
EXPOSURE TO COMPUTER SCIENCE

01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:52.425
USING DEVELOPMENTALLY

01:53:52.492 --> 01:53:53.993
APPROPRIATE PRACTICE IS KEY TO

01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:55.461
CREATING SUSTAINING INTEREST IN

01:53:55.528 --> 01:53:57.263
COMPUTER SCIENCE. RESEARCH THAT

01:53:57.330 --> 01:53:59.132
SUGGESTS THAT LEARNING STEM

01:53:59.199 --> 01:54:00.333
CONTENT DURING PRESCHOOL YEARS

01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:02.168
IS CRITICAL TO LATER SUCCESS IN

01:54:02.235 --> 01:54:04.437
SCHOOLS FOR ALL DOMAINS.

01:54:04.504 --> 01:54:05.071
INCLUDING READING COMPREHENSION

01:54:05.138 --> 01:54:06.306
AND MATHEMATICS FOR

01:54:06.372 --> 01:54:07.540
PRESCHOOLERS THAT MEANS

01:54:07.607 --> 01:54:08.374
ENGAGING IN LEARNING AND WHAT

01:54:08.441 --> 01:54:10.510
FEELS LIKE PLAY- I BROUGHT

01:54:10.577 --> 01:54:11.844
TODAY THE CODING MOUSE THAT IS

01:54:11.911 --> 01:54:12.912
VERY POPULAR IN THE PRESCHOOL

01:54:12.979 --> 01:54:14.414
AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SPACE.

01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:21.087
BECAUSE. IT'S IMPORTANCE USING

01:54:21.154 --> 01:54:23.289
THIS CODING MOUSE USING THIS

01:54:23.356 --> 01:54:24.524
CUTTING MOUSE STUDENTS DEVELOP

01:54:24.591 --> 01:54:26.526
SPATIAL SENSE BY EXPLORING THE

01:54:26.593 --> 01:54:27.360
DIRECTIONAL MOVEMENT OF THE

01:54:27.427 --> 01:54:29.929
MOUSE THE IDEAS OF OVER UNDER

01:54:29.996 --> 01:54:32.098
THROUGH AND AROUND THIS KIND OF

01:54:32.165 --> 01:54:33.099
ACTIVITY HELP STUDENTS

01:54:33.166 --> 01:54:34.267
UNDERSTAND COMPUTER SCIENCE

01:54:34.334 --> 01:54:36.569
ENCODING EARLY ON AND SEEING

01:54:36.636 --> 01:54:38.638
PLAY AS PART OF LESSON PLANNING

01:54:38.705 --> 01:54:40.106
WHILE ALSO DEVELOPING SKILLS

01:54:40.173 --> 01:54:41.674
LIKE PROBLEM SOLVING CRITICAL

01:54:41.741 --> 01:54:43.109
AND CREATIVE THINKING

01:54:43.176 --> 01:54:45.044
COLLABORATION AND COMMUNICATION.

01:54:45.111 --> 01:54:46.379
FINALLY COMPUTER SCIENCE SHOULD

01:54:46.446 --> 01:54:47.981
BE TAUGHT SIMPLY AS A SUBJECT

01:54:48.047 --> 01:54:49.449
BUT RATHER AS PART OF A CAREER

01:54:49.515 --> 01:54:51.417
EXPLORATION EARLY ON. MOST OF

01:54:51.484 --> 01:54:53.019
US WHEN ASKED IN ELEMENTARY

01:54:53.086 --> 01:54:54.020
SCHOOL PROBABLY SAID SOMETHING

01:54:54.087 --> 01:54:55.688
LIKE TEACHER DOCTOR OR

01:54:55.755 --> 01:54:58.057
POLICEMEN WHILE THAT LIST OFTEN

01:54:58.124 --> 01:55:00.627
DOES EXPANDS AWARENESS OF

01:55:00.693 --> 01:55:02.161
CAREERS IN THE SKILLED NEEDS TO

01:55:02.228 --> 01:55:03.096
BE ADDRESSED SOONER RATHER THAN

01:55:03.162 --> 01:55:05.198
LATER. JOCELYN MACULA OF

FIFTH GRADE GIRL WROTE OF MISS

01:55:15.908 --> 01:55:18.011
MACULA I NEVER HAD ANY COMPUTER

01:55:18.077 --> 01:55:20.146
SCIENCE EXPERIENCE AND BECAUSE

01:55:20.213 --> 01:55:21.414
THE MISS MACULA I FEEL I HAVE

01:55:21.481 --> 01:55:22.582
THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE AN

01:55:22.649 --> 01:55:24.384
ENGINEER. I AM LEARNING THAT I

01:55:24.450 --> 01:55:26.486
AM ABLE TO BE AN ENGINEER EVEN

01:55:26.552 --> 01:55:28.354
THOUGH I'M FROM COST. AS THIS

01:55:28.421 --> 01:55:30.123
EXAMPLE SHOWS AWARENESS OF THE

01:55:30.189 --> 01:55:31.991
SUBJECT AREA IS NOT ENOUGH THIS

01:55:32.058 --> 01:55:33.459
STUDENT CLEARLY HAD HEARD ABOUT

01:55:33.526 --> 01:55:34.827
COMPUTER SCIENCE SHE HAD HEARD

01:55:34.894 --> 01:55:36.129
ABOUT ENGINEERING. THE

01:55:36.195 --> 01:55:36.829
DIFFERENCE IS THAT STUDENTS

01:55:36.896 --> 01:55:38.865
MUST BE EXPOSED TO AND

01:55:38.931 --> 01:55:40.700

EXPOSURE AND EXPERIENCE MANY

01:55:43.970 --> 01:55:45.405
STUDENTS ASSUME THEY CAN'T

01:55:45.471 --> 01:55:46.372
PURSUE THAT SUBJECT. AND OUR

01:55:46.439 --> 01:55:48.474
CAREER. THE SAYING IS YOU CAN'T

01:55:48.541 --> 01:55:50.209
BE WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE. IT

01:55:50.276 --> 01:55:51.811
APPLIES HERE. STUDENTS NEED TO

01:55:51.878 --> 01:55:53.346
EXPERIENCE COMPUTER SCIENCE IN

01:55:53.413 --> 01:55:54.414

EXPERIENCE COMPUTER SCIENCE

01:55:57.850 --> 01:55:59.485
HANDS ON AND THEY NEED TO SEE

01:55:59.552 --> 01:56:00.987
WHAT A COMPUTER SCIENTIST IS

01:56:01.054 --> 01:56:02.021
AND WHAT A COMPUTER SCIENTIST

01:56:02.088 --> 01:56:03.756
DOES. WE DON'T WANT STUDENTS TO

01:56:03.823 --> 01:56:05.124
SAY THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE A GIRL

01:56:05.191 --> 01:56:06.659
BECAUSE THEY ARE STUDENT COLOR

01:56:06.726 --> 01:56:07.560

FROM TAKING SPECIFIC STEM

01:59:09.876 --> 01:59:11.344
CURRICULUM. BECAUSE THEY NEED

01:59:11.410 --> 01:59:14.013
TO TAKE MANDATORY CLASSES. MANY

01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:15.848
DISTRICTS HAVE PROTOCOLS IN

EDUCATION FOR ALL STUDENTS WE

01:59:38.604 --> 01:59:39.839
NEED TO BEGIN WITH HOW WE

01:59:39.906 --> 01:59:41.307
EDUCATE OUR NEW TEACHERS COMING

01:59:41.374 --> 01:59:42.909
INTO THE PROFESSION. THEY NEED

02:00:04.931 --> 02:00:05.731
STUDENT INTEREST IN THE STEM

02:00:05.798 --> 02:00:08.401
FIELDS. STUDENTS SHOULD BE ABLE

02:00:08.467 --> 02:00:09.735
TO ACCESS STEM CORRECT

02:00:09.802 --> 02:00:11.971
TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION AND

02:00:12.038 --> 02:00:13.806
COMPUTER BECAUSE- IN COMMUNITY

02:00:13.873 --> 02:00:15.708
COLLEGES OR A FOUR YEAR DEGREE

02:00:15.775 --> 02:00:17.543
WITH A CAREER PIPELINE FOR

02:00:17.610 --> 02:00:19.712
GRADUATING STUDENTS IN THE STEM

02:00:19.779 --> 02:00:21.914
INDUSTRY. THE MODEL WE HAVE NOW

02:00:21.981 --> 02:00:23.883
IS NOT ENOUGH TO SERVICE ALL OF

02:00:23.950 --> 02:00:24.951
OUR STUDENTS SPECIFICALLY

02:00:25.017 --> 02:00:26.252
STUDENTS FROM DISADVANTAGED

02:00:26.319 --> 02:00:28.020
COMMUNITIES IT IS IMPERATIVE

02:00:28.087 --> 02:00:29.155
THAT WE TAKE THE NECESSARY

02:00:29.221 --> 02:00:31.791
STEPS TO ENSURE THAT ALL OUR

02:00:31.857 --> 02:00:34.293
STUDENTS EXPERIENCE A QUALITY

02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:37.129
STEM EDUCATION. THERE'S NEED TO

02:00:37.196 --> 02:00:39.298
BE A SYSTEMIC PARADIGM SHIFT

02:00:39.365 --> 02:00:41.033
THAT INSTITUTIONALIZED STEM

02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:43.703
EDUCATION FOR TKA TWELFTH THIS

02:00:43.769 --> 02:00:45.204
WILL NEED TO BE SUPPORTED BY

02:00:45.271 --> 02:00:46.372
THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

02:00:46.439 --> 02:00:49.108
ED. TO DISTRICTS ENSURING ALL

02:00:49.175 --> 02:00:51.577
STUDENTS HAVE EQUAL ACCESS AND

02:00:51.644 --> 02:00:53.946
MONETARY SUPPORT NO MATTER

02:00:54.013 --> 02:00:54.780
WHICH PART OF TOWN THEY LIVED

02:00:54.847 --> 02:00:57.717
IN. STARTING STEM EDUCATION AND

02:00:57.783 --> 02:00:59.452
SECONDARY GRADES IS TO LET.

02:00:59.518 --> 02:01:01.454
CHILDREN ARE NATURALLY CURIOUS

02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:03.289
AND THIS SHOULD BE FOSTERED AT

02:01:03.356 --> 02:01:05.358
A YOUNG AGE WHICH MEANS STEM

02:01:05.424 --> 02:01:07.259
EDUCATION SHOULD BE STARTING AN

02:01:07.326 --> 02:01:09.862
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. IN CLOSING

02:01:09.929 --> 02:01:12.531
CTA. RESHAPES THE CHAIR AND

YOU SO MUCH SINCE OUR LAST

02:01:54.740 --> 02:01:57.610
PANEL I REALLY ENJOYED THE- THE

02:01:57.677 --> 02:01:59.512
KIND OF I FELT LIKE THE BOTH

02:01:59.578 --> 02:02:01.180
SIDES LIKE IT'S WE NEED TO

02:02:01.247 --> 02:02:02.348
START EARLY AND IT'S NOT TOO

02:02:02.415 --> 02:02:05.618
LATE YEAH. I LOVED HEARING AT

02:02:05.685 --> 02:02:07.787
ALL AT THE SAME TIME RIGHT HAVE

02:02:07.853 --> 02:02:08.688
YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN A STEM

02:02:08.754 --> 02:02:10.990
EDUCATOR FOR YEARS ALWAYS

02:02:11.057 --> 02:02:13.059
FOCUSED ON YOUNGER KIDS. I ALSO

02:02:13.125 --> 02:02:15.361
WORKED AT CAL TECH ACTS- BUT

02:02:15.428 --> 02:02:16.996
THE KIDS THAT WENT THERE WERE

02:02:17.063 --> 02:02:19.331
ALREADY INTERESTED AND WE WERE

02:02:19.398 --> 02:02:21.567
JUST FOCUSING ON MAKING THEM

02:02:21.634 --> 02:02:24.837
SUCCESSFUL- IN THE FUTURE- SO I

02:02:24.904 --> 02:02:27.039
REALLY ENJOYED THIS- BUT BEFORE

02:02:27.106 --> 02:02:29.175
I ASK MY QUESTION I'D LIKETO

02:02:29.241 --> 02:02:32.912
OPEN IT UP TO. THE COMMITTEE SO

02:02:32.978 --> 02:02:35.648
MR OBERNOLTE. SO I THOUGHT IT

02:02:35.715 --> 02:02:36.248
WAS A FAST NAY THIS. OF WHEN

02:02:36.315 --> 02:02:36.816
THE APPROACH TIME TO START

02:02:36.882 --> 02:02:38.984
EDUCATION AND COMPUTER SCIENCES

02:02:39.051 --> 02:02:40.686
YOU HEARD ME OUT REALLY THREE

02:02:40.753 --> 02:02:41.954
DIFFERENT OPINIONS WITH. THIS

02:02:42.021 --> 02:02:43.489
GARDENER SAYING BEFORE

02:02:43.556 --> 02:02:45.224
KINDERGARTEN MISSPENT METER

02:02:45.291 --> 02:02:46.559
SAYING YOU KNOW IN IT-

02:02:46.625 --> 02:02:48.327
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND DOCTOR

02:02:48.394 --> 02:02:51.063
KLAUS SAYING IF NOT. I MEAN.

02:02:51.130 --> 02:02:52.398
IT'S NOT A BAD THING TO START

02:02:52.465 --> 02:02:53.332
SOON BUT YOU CERTAINLY CAN

02:02:53.399 --> 02:02:54.867
START LATER AS WELL- BUT I

02:02:54.934 --> 02:02:57.369
ACTUALLY THINK THAT. THE

02:02:57.436 --> 02:03:01.741
DISCONNECT HERE IS. A FAILURE

02:03:01.807 --> 02:03:03.209
TO FIND DEFINE EXACTLY WHAT WE

02:03:03.275 --> 02:03:05.511
MEAN WHEN WE SAY THE A WHAT IS

02:03:05.578 --> 02:03:06.912
COMPUTER SCIENCE WHAT IS CODING

02:03:06.979 --> 02:03:08.080
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE NOT

02:03:08.147 --> 02:03:09.381
GOING TO TAKE. A PRE

02:03:09.448 --> 02:03:11.217
KINDERGARTEN STUDENT AND SAY

02:03:11.283 --> 02:03:13.719
LET'S TALK ABOUT PYTHON RIGHT-

02:03:13.786 --> 02:03:15.621
SO WHAT WE'RE TEACHING IS VERY

02:03:15.688 --> 02:03:16.422
DIFFERENT I THINK IT'S AN

02:03:16.489 --> 02:03:18.190
ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF WHAT IT MEANS

02:03:18.257 --> 02:03:19.492
TO BE A CODER. IS VERY

02:03:19.558 --> 02:03:20.392
DIFFERENT WHEN I LEARNED TO

02:03:20.459 --> 02:03:22.561
PROGRAM. IT WAS CLEAR THAT

02:03:22.628 --> 02:03:24.597
CODING MATT TAKING A-

02:03:24.663 --> 02:03:25.664
PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AND

02:03:25.731 --> 02:03:28.968
WRITING COMPUTER CODE BUT- AS

02:03:29.034 --> 02:03:30.836
COMPUTER SCIENCE HAS EVOLVED

02:03:30.903 --> 02:03:32.037
YOU KNOW OBJECT ORIENTATION

02:03:32.104 --> 02:03:32.838
MEANS THAT REALLY ARE USING

02:03:32.905 --> 02:03:34.306
CODE THAT OTHER PEOPLE WRITE.

02:03:34.373 --> 02:03:35.641
SCRIPTING LANGUAGES MEAN THAT

02:03:35.708 --> 02:03:36.876
REALLY YOU'RE NOT WRITING A

02:03:36.942 --> 02:03:38.277
PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AT ALL AND

02:03:38.344 --> 02:03:39.912
NOW I MEAN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

02:03:39.979 --> 02:03:41.413
SKILLS THAT WE TEACH TO

02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:44.784
STUDENTS. EVEN DOING WORK IN AN

02:03:44.850 --> 02:03:46.051
EXCEL SPREADSHEET OR DOING

02:03:46.118 --> 02:03:47.753
ADVANCED SEARCH IN GOOGLE I

02:03:47.820 --> 02:03:49.021
MEAN THAT IS CODING THERE

02:03:49.088 --> 02:03:50.589
REALLY IS THAT IS PROGRAMMING

02:03:50.656 --> 02:03:52.124
SO I MEAN I REALLY THINK THAT

02:03:52.191 --> 02:03:53.526
THE ANSWER TO THIS YOU KNOW

02:03:53.592 --> 02:03:55.628
THIS. THIS DOESN'T- IS AN

02:03:55.694 --> 02:03:56.796
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT CODING

02:03:56.862 --> 02:03:58.164
MEANS A LOT MORE THAN JUST

02:03:58.230 --> 02:04:00.065
WRITING LINES OF COMPUTER CODE.

02:04:00.132 --> 02:04:01.867
AND YOU KNOW JUST TEACHING A

02:04:01.934 --> 02:04:03.636
PRE KINDERGARTEN STUDENT HOW TO

02:04:03.702 --> 02:04:06.572
USE A COMPUTER TO PERFORM TASKS

02:04:06.639 --> 02:04:07.740
TO GET INFORMATION YOU KNOW

02:04:07.807 --> 02:04:10.176
THAT IS. PREPARING THEM FOR A

02:04:10.242 --> 02:04:12.478
CAREER IN PROGRAMMING. SO IF I

02:04:12.545 --> 02:04:13.512
MAY EIGHT I THINK THAT ONE OF

02:04:13.579 --> 02:04:16.415
THE THINGS THAT- WE

02:04:16.482 --> 02:04:17.483
INTERCHANGEABLY USE THE WORD

02:04:17.550 --> 02:04:19.151
CODING IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND

02:04:19.218 --> 02:04:22.521
OFTEN TIMES THAT- ACTUALLY. UP

02:04:22.588 --> 02:04:24.290
PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE COMPOSED AT

02:04:24.356 --> 02:04:26.625
CODING IS A PART OF COMPUTER

02:04:26.692 --> 02:04:28.994
SCIENCE BUT NOT THE ONLY PART

02:04:29.061 --> 02:04:30.329
AND SO WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT

02:04:30.396 --> 02:04:31.964
THOSE THINGS- BROKEN APART AN-

02:04:32.031 --> 02:04:34.366
IMPORTANT I. IN ANSWER TO YOUR

02:04:34.433 --> 02:04:36.302
ABOUT. A STUDENTS LET ME JUST

02:04:36.368 --> 02:04:38.637
READ WHAT WE WHAT WE UTILIZE A

02:04:38.704 --> 02:04:40.439
PRE K. C. CAN UNDERSTAND. YOU

02:04:40.506 --> 02:04:41.140
SAID THAT REALLY COOL NOW

02:04:41.207 --> 02:04:42.908
BECAUSE IT'S COLORFUL AND I

02:04:42.975 --> 02:04:44.577
BROUGHT WITH ME SOME. STUDENTS

02:04:44.643 --> 02:04:45.611
DIFFICULT SPATIAL SENSE WHEN

02:04:45.678 --> 02:04:47.947
THE ACTIVITIES THAT IT EXPLORE

02:04:48.013 --> 02:04:49.615
CORRECTIONAL MOVEMENT OVER

02:04:49.682 --> 02:04:50.983
UNDER THROUGH AROUND BUT THEN

02:04:51.050 --> 02:04:52.585
AGAIN TO DEVELOP CODING SKILLS

02:04:52.651 --> 02:04:54.353
AS THEY PLAN UP. WITH CREATE

02:04:54.420 --> 02:04:56.555
WEARABLE CODE AND CODE AN

02:04:56.622 --> 02:04:59.592
INTERACTIVE ROBOTIC DEVICE.

02:04:59.658 --> 02:05:00.893
KATE AMOUNTS. I THINK IN TO

02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:08.000
PASS CAN CREATE. CODE THAT THE

02:05:08.067 --> 02:05:08.868
LEAD TO THE LOOK OF A OF A

02:05:08.934 --> 02:05:10.236
HIDDEN ITEM. AND SO THOSE KIND

02:05:10.302 --> 02:05:11.437
OF. SPARK EARLY ON SO IT'S A-

02:05:11.503 --> 02:05:12.037
THE WRITING OF THE CODE THAT

02:05:12.104 --> 02:05:12.538
YOU'RE TALK ABOUT. BUT

02:05:12.605 --> 02:05:13.439
EXPLORING HOW. COMPUTER SCIENCE

02:05:13.505 --> 02:05:15.074
CODE CAN BE A PART OF EVERYDAY

02:05:15.140 --> 02:05:16.442
LIFE AND WHAT THEY USE

02:05:16.508 --> 02:05:17.977
THROUGHOUT THE DAY I THINK

02:05:18.043 --> 02:05:19.044
THOSE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT AND

02:05:19.111 --> 02:05:20.880
USING IT IN. DEVELOPMENTALLY

02:05:20.946 --> 02:05:24.183
APPROPRIATE- ACTIVITIES IS KEY

02:05:24.250 --> 02:05:24.783
TO ENSURING THAT THOSE THINGS

02:05:24.850 --> 02:05:29.855
HAPPEN. SO I SO FIRST OF ALL I

02:05:29.922 --> 02:05:31.824
ACTUALLY BELIEVE IT'S REALLY

02:05:31.891 --> 02:05:33.626
IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO

02:05:33.692 --> 02:05:36.962
LEARNING. NOT JUST CODING BUT

02:05:37.029 --> 02:05:38.931
THE BROADER SET OF

02:05:38.998 --> 02:05:41.533
COMPUTATIONAL THINKING SKILLS.

02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:43.469
BUT I WANT TO FOCUS RIGHT NOW

02:05:43.535 --> 02:05:44.803
ON A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:47.773
POPULATION. A I AND DATA

02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:50.809
SCIENCE AND COMPUTER SCIENCE

02:05:50.876 --> 02:05:51.710
ARE CHANGING THE WORLD WE LIVE

02:05:51.777 --> 02:05:54.113
IN. AND WITHIN THE NEXT TEN

02:05:54.179 --> 02:05:55.848
YEARS THEY'RE ALL KINDS OF

02:05:55.915 --> 02:05:58.584
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW LONG AFTER

02:05:58.651 --> 02:06:00.352
THEY GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE WHO

02:06:00.419 --> 02:06:00.953
WERE GOING NEED TO LEARN THE

02:06:01.020 --> 02:06:03.322
SKILLS SO WHEN WE THE WHOLE

02:06:03.389 --> 02:06:05.391
POINT ABOUT I THINK WHAT WE'RE

02:06:05.457 --> 02:06:07.626
ALL SAYING. IS THAT THERE ARE

02:06:07.693 --> 02:06:10.529
WAYS TO MAKE THIS KNOWLEDGE

02:06:10.596 --> 02:06:12.264
EXCESS ACCESSIBLE AN

02:06:12.331 --> 02:06:14.300
INTERESTING AND HIGHLY

02:06:14.366 --> 02:06:16.168
MOTIVATING FOR PEOPLE OF ANY

02:06:16.235 --> 02:06:17.703
AGE WITH THE WE'RE TALKING

02:06:17.770 --> 02:06:19.471
ABOUT PRE K. STUDENT. A HIGH

02:06:19.538 --> 02:06:20.339
SCHOOL STUDENT MIDDLE SCHOOL

02:06:20.406 --> 02:06:22.274
STUDENT COLLEGE STUDENT

02:06:22.341 --> 02:06:24.276
GRADUATE STUDENT AND YOU KNOW

02:06:24.343 --> 02:06:27.112
WHAT I MENTIONED THE- POST OP

02:06:27.179 --> 02:06:29.114
PROGRAM WERE STARTING. I I'M AN

02:06:29.181 --> 02:06:30.883
EXAMPLE OF SOMEBODY WHO GOT HER

02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:33.152
PHD AND MATHEMATICS NEVER TOOK

02:06:33.218 --> 02:06:34.853
A COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSE NEVER

02:06:34.920 --> 02:06:36.288
WROTE A LINE OF CODE.

02:06:36.355 --> 02:06:38.824
DISCOVERED WITHIN THE YEAR

02:06:38.891 --> 02:06:41.460
AFTER MY PHD THAT THE JOB

02:06:41.527 --> 02:06:42.361
OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:06:42.428 --> 02:06:44.229
MATHEMATICIANS WHO ALSO COULD

02:06:44.296 --> 02:06:46.699
DO COMPUTER SCIENCE WERE LIKE A

02:06:46.765 --> 02:06:47.299
HUNDRED TIMES WHATTHEY WERE

02:06:47.366 --> 02:06:49.568
FROM ETHNIC MATHEMATICAL PH DIS

02:06:49.635 --> 02:06:52.638
WEB BACK. STARTED A SECOND PHD

02:06:52.705 --> 02:06:53.939
IN COMPUTER SCIENCE GOT HIRED

02:06:54.006 --> 02:06:55.174
BY ONE OF THE TOP TEN

02:06:55.240 --> 02:06:57.409
DEPARTMENTS IN THE WORLD.

02:06:57.476 --> 02:06:58.377
LITERALLY NINE MONTHS AFTER I

02:06:58.444 --> 02:07:01.013
STARTED. OKAY THAT'S THE

02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:03.716
DIFFERENCE ABOUT. BEING ABLE TO

02:07:03.782 --> 02:07:05.818
LEARN WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS AND

02:07:05.884 --> 02:07:07.519
I THINK WHAT WE'RE ALL SAYING

02:07:07.586 --> 02:07:10.155
IS NUMBER ONE. ALL OF OUR

02:07:10.222 --> 02:07:12.858
CHILDREN NEED IT. ALL OF OUR

02:07:12.925 --> 02:07:14.660
COLLEGE STUDENTS NEED IT. ALL

02:07:14.727 --> 02:07:16.795
OF OUR ADULTS INCLUDING PEOPLE

02:07:16.862 --> 02:07:18.864
WHO ARE NOT CODING ANYMORE.

02:07:18.931 --> 02:07:20.966
THEY ARE GOING TO NEED THIS.

02:07:21.033 --> 02:07:23.736
AND WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS WE

02:07:23.802 --> 02:07:25.537
HAVE TO GET MUCH BETTER AT

02:07:25.604 --> 02:07:31.977
PROVIDING ACCESS. TO EVERYONE.

02:07:32.044 --> 02:07:35.247
FOR MORE PLEASE- WE ARE NOT AT

02:07:35.314 --> 02:07:37.316
C¡ DOT ORG WE'RE NOT TRYING TO

02:07:37.383 --> 02:07:40.252
CREATE- THE OPPORTUNITIES AND

02:07:40.319 --> 02:07:42.254
ACCESS SO THAT THE STUDENTS

02:07:42.321 --> 02:07:43.288
WILL BE GRADUATING FROM HIGH

02:07:43.355 --> 02:07:44.390
SCHOOL GOING INTO COLLEGE TO BE

02:07:44.456 --> 02:07:46.558
COMPUTER SCIENCE MAJORS NOR ARE

02:07:46.625 --> 02:07:48.127
WE SAYING THAT EVERY STUDENT

02:07:48.193 --> 02:07:49.595
NEEDS TO BE A COMPUTER

02:07:49.661 --> 02:07:52.064
PROGRAMMER OR ENGINEER BUT IT

02:07:52.131 --> 02:07:55.701
WE HAVE SEEN THAT EVERY FIELD I

02:07:55.768 --> 02:07:56.869
WE HAVE NOT FOUND A SINGLE

02:07:56.935 --> 02:07:59.271
FIELD WHERE AN UNDERSTANDING OF

02:07:59.338 --> 02:08:00.806
COMPUTING AND AN UNDERSTANDING

02:08:00.873 --> 02:08:02.207
OF THE CONCEPTS OF COMPUTER

02:08:02.274 --> 02:08:03.208
SCIENCE LIKE COMPUTATIONAL

02:08:03.275 --> 02:08:05.778
THINKING. ARE NOT NECESSARY

02:08:05.844 --> 02:08:07.046
THAT'S NOT TO SAY EVERY SINGLE

02:08:07.112 --> 02:08:09.048
JOB WILL REQUIRE THAT BUT EVERY

02:08:09.114 --> 02:08:12.418
FIELD HAS- A COMPONENT THAT

02:08:12.484 --> 02:08:14.186
REQUIRES UNDERSTANDING IN

02:08:14.253 --> 02:08:15.954
COMPUTER SCIENCE- THE LAST

02:08:16.021 --> 02:08:17.156
POINT I'LL MAKE IS WHEN OUR

02:08:17.222 --> 02:08:18.090
FOUNDER STARTED CO DOT ORG HE

02:08:18.157 --> 02:08:18.891
USED TO SAY IN HIS INITIAL

02:08:18.957 --> 02:08:20.993
TALKS YOU UNLESS YOU'RE DRIVING

02:08:21.060 --> 02:08:22.227
TRUCKER FLIPPING BURGERS YOU

02:08:22.294 --> 02:08:23.796
DON'T NEED YOU'RE GOING TO NEED

02:08:23.862 --> 02:08:24.963
TO HAVE A BASIC UNDERSTANDING

02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:26.465
OF COMPUTING AND COMPUTER

02:08:26.532 --> 02:08:28.534
SCIENCE BUT EVEN NOW IN THE

02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:30.135
TIME AUTOMATION WE HAVE.

02:08:30.202 --> 02:08:32.404
AUTOMATED TRUCKS DRIVING EVERY

02:08:32.471 --> 02:08:35.174
DAY FROM ARIZONA TO SOUTHERN

02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:37.242
CALIFORNIA- THAT ARE SEMI

02:08:37.309 --> 02:08:39.678
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES WE HAVE NO

02:08:39.745 --> 02:08:40.846
IN MANY OF THE LARGEST FAST

02:08:40.913 --> 02:08:42.815
FOOD INDUSTRY'S COMPUTERIZED

02:08:42.881 --> 02:08:44.216
BURGER FLIPPERS REPLACING THE

02:08:44.283 --> 02:08:46.485
JOBS OF THE MOST ENTRY LEVEL

02:08:46.552 --> 02:08:48.253
JOBS SO WHAT WE HAVE TO MAKE

02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:49.788
SURE THAT WE'RE GIVING STUDENTS

02:08:49.855 --> 02:08:51.290
THE TOOLS WHO MAY NOT BE GOING

02:08:51.356 --> 02:08:52.558
TO COLLEGE MAY BE PURSUING

02:08:52.624 --> 02:08:55.194
SERVICE INDUSTRY CAREERS- THE

02:08:55.260 --> 02:08:56.662
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE OTHER

02:08:56.728 --> 02:08:59.064
OPTIONS TO USE THAT COMPUTERS

02:08:59.131 --> 02:08:59.965
WELL LET ME ASK A FOLLOW UP

02:09:00.032 --> 02:09:01.733
QUESTION ABOUT THAT BECAUSE YOU

02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:02.634
SAID IN YOUR COMMENTS YOU WERE

02:09:02.701 --> 02:09:05.137
TALKING ABOUT. OF THE HIGH WAGE

02:09:05.204 --> 02:09:07.039
HIGH WAGES IN THE INFORMATION

02:09:07.106 --> 02:09:09.675
INDUSTRY AND THE NEED TO-

02:09:09.741 --> 02:09:11.710
CREATE OPPORTUNITIES TO HAVE

02:09:11.777 --> 02:09:14.346
UNDERSERVED UNITIES GET ACCESS

02:09:14.413 --> 02:09:15.881
TO THOSE WAGES WHICH IS

02:09:15.948 --> 02:09:16.582
SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE'RE

02:09:16.648 --> 02:09:21.854
ALL IN. WITH ABOUT YOU KNOW

02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:23.155
TRISTE. FEET OF INFORMATION TO.

02:09:23.222 --> 02:09:24.356
IS THE JUST. IN WORKER PRO.

02:09:24.423 --> 02:09:25.357
BETWEEN PEOPLE THAT ARE REALLY

02:09:25.424 --> 02:09:26.692
REALLY GOOD AT IT AND PEOPLE

02:09:26.758 --> 02:09:27.759
THAT YOU KNOW ARE PRETTY GOOD

02:09:27.826 --> 02:09:29.061
AT IT SO I MEAN TO GIVE AN

02:09:29.128 --> 02:09:30.362
EXAMPLE I HAVE SOFTWARE

02:09:30.429 --> 02:09:31.463
ENGINEERS THAT WORK FOR ME.

02:09:31.530 --> 02:09:32.531
THAT ARE TEN TIMES MORE

02:09:32.598 --> 02:09:34.099
PRODUCTIVE THAN OTHERS THE WORK

02:09:34.166 --> 02:09:35.367
FOR ME SO IT CREATES AN

02:09:35.434 --> 02:09:37.302
INTERESTING DILEMMA BECAUSE-

02:09:37.369 --> 02:09:40.305
HOW DO YOU. CREATE COMPENSATION

02:09:40.372 --> 02:09:42.441
EQUITY IN THAT KIND OF

02:09:42.508 --> 02:09:44.042
ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE- I MEAN.

02:09:44.109 --> 02:09:45.244
SOCIETY WOULDN'T SAY IT'S FAIR

02:09:45.310 --> 02:09:46.845
TO PAY ONE PERSON TEN TIMES AS

02:09:46.912 --> 02:09:50.115
MUCH AS ANOTHER. BUT IF THEIR

02:09:50.182 --> 02:09:51.416
PRODUCTIVITY IS TEN TIMES

02:09:51.483 --> 02:09:52.784
HIGHER IF YOU DON'T PAY THEM AT

02:09:52.851 --> 02:09:54.686
LEAST TWO OR THREE TIMES AS

02:09:54.753 --> 02:09:55.287
MUCH THEY'RE GOING TO GO WORK

02:09:55.354 --> 02:09:56.688
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE SO. YOU KNOW

02:09:56.755 --> 02:09:57.489
I WONDER YOU CREATE THESE

02:09:57.556 --> 02:09:58.490
OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDERSERVED

02:09:58.557 --> 02:09:59.758
COMMUNITIES BUT AT THE SAME

02:09:59.825 --> 02:10:01.260
TIME YOU'RE EXACERBATING INCOME

02:10:01.326 --> 02:10:02.728
INEQUALITY WITHIN THOSE

02:10:02.794 --> 02:10:03.862
COMMUNITIES HOW DO WE HOW DO WE

02:10:03.929 --> 02:10:05.631
AS A SOCIETY. GRAPPLE WITH THAT

02:10:05.697 --> 02:10:07.566
PROBLEM. I'M TRYING TO

02:10:07.633 --> 02:10:09.868
UNDERSTAND- OF THE PEOPLE THAT

02:10:09.935 --> 02:10:13.372
YOU ARE IMPLYING. ARE YOU ARE

02:10:13.438 --> 02:10:14.606
YOU SAYING THAT PEOPLE FROM

02:10:14.673 --> 02:10:16.074
UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES

02:10:16.141 --> 02:10:17.976
ARE NOT PERFORMING AS ON OR NOT

02:10:18.043 --> 02:10:19.912
OKAY. A LITTLE CONFUSED NO I

02:10:19.978 --> 02:10:23.949
MEAN I MEAN THAT IF YOU TAKE.

02:10:24.016 --> 02:10:26.185
IF YOU TAKE IN A POPULATION OF

02:10:26.251 --> 02:10:27.853
PROGRAMMERS IN A PROGRAM IS

02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:29.755
UNIQUE IF YOU HIRE A COUPLE

02:10:29.821 --> 02:10:31.823
PEOPLE TO- YOU KNOW BUILD A

02:10:31.890 --> 02:10:33.425
WIDGET ON ASSEMBLY LINE YOU

02:10:33.492 --> 02:10:35.294
KNOW ONE MIGHT BE TWO OR THREE

02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:36.895
TIMES AS MO AT MOST AS

02:10:36.962 --> 02:10:37.930
PRODUCTIVE AS THE NEXT ONE AND

02:10:37.996 --> 02:10:39.264
USUALLY. THAT INCREASE THE

02:10:39.331 --> 02:10:40.365
PRODUCTIVITY INCREASES WITH

02:10:40.432 --> 02:10:43.135
EXPERIENCE- PROGRAMMING IS VERY

02:10:43.202 --> 02:10:43.702
MUCH NOT THAT WAY THERE ARE

02:10:43.769 --> 02:10:45.604
PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST. THE JUST

02:10:45.671 --> 02:10:47.539
BRAINS ARE WIRED TO WORK THAT

02:10:47.606 --> 02:10:50.209
WAY RIGHT. AND YOU KNOW THEY

02:10:50.275 --> 02:10:51.009
AND THEY COULD THEY COULD BE

02:10:51.076 --> 02:10:51.877
TEN TIMES AS PRODUCTIVE AS THE

02:10:51.944 --> 02:10:53.912
PERSON NEXT TO THEM- SO I JUST

02:10:53.979 --> 02:10:55.581
WONDER. HOW DO WE A SOCIETY

02:10:55.647 --> 02:10:56.515
GRAPPLE WITH THAT PROBLEM

02:10:56.582 --> 02:10:58.217
BECAUSE IT IT YOU KNOW WHAT. I

02:10:58.283 --> 02:11:00.152
WANT YOU KNOW SO RIGHT NOW ONE

02:11:00.219 --> 02:11:01.987
OF THE THINGS WE KNOW IS THAT-

02:11:02.054 --> 02:11:03.722
MOST OF THE TOP SOFTWARE

02:11:03.789 --> 02:11:05.857
DEVELOPING. ACES ARE USING PAIR

02:11:05.924 --> 02:11:08.560
PROGRAMMING AND USING IT

02:11:08.627 --> 02:11:12.698
BECAUSE IT A CREATES LIKE MOST

02:11:12.764 --> 02:11:15.300
OF THE EFFORT IN A COMPLICATED

02:11:15.367 --> 02:11:17.169
SOFTWARE SYSTEM GOES INTO

02:11:17.236 --> 02:11:19.938
DEBUGGING I MEAN. MAYBE LESS

02:11:20.005 --> 02:11:21.406
TRUE IN THE GAME INDUSTRY BUT

02:11:21.473 --> 02:11:24.676
DEFINITELY FOR- YOU KNOW LARGE

02:11:24.743 --> 02:11:27.446
SCALE SYSTEMS AND SO WHAT YOU

02:11:27.512 --> 02:11:29.414
REALLY WANT TO ACHIEVE IT'S NOT

02:11:29.481 --> 02:11:30.616
THAT YOU CAN WRITE THE CODE

02:11:30.682 --> 02:11:32.851
FAST BUT YOU CAN WRITE THE CODE

02:11:32.918 --> 02:11:34.820
AT A REASONABLE SPEED BUT IT

02:11:34.886 --> 02:11:37.656
HAS MANY FEWER ERRORS. AND SO

02:11:37.723 --> 02:11:39.891
THERE ARE A BUNCH OF WHAT'S

02:11:39.958 --> 02:11:41.393
REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT THIS

02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:43.428
IS THAT PAIR PROGRAMMING DOES

02:11:43.495 --> 02:11:44.930
MUCH BETTER AND ACTUALLY DOES

02:11:44.997 --> 02:11:46.798
BETTER WITH PEOPLE WHOSE BRAINS

02:11:46.865 --> 02:11:49.601
ARE WIRED DIFFERENTLY TOGETHER.

02:11:49.668 --> 02:11:52.471
AND SO THIS WHOLE IDEA AND YOU

02:11:52.537 --> 02:11:54.473
KNOW I HAPPEN TO HAVE A SON

02:11:54.539 --> 02:11:57.075
WHO- IS AN AMAZING SOFTWARE

02:11:57.142 --> 02:11:59.444
ARCHITECT SOFTWARE ENGINEER IN

02:11:59.511 --> 02:12:01.246
WHO CAN WRITE REALLY QUICKLY.

02:12:01.313 --> 02:12:02.848
BUT ONE OF THINGS THAT'S BEEN

02:12:02.914 --> 02:12:04.383
INTERESTING TO ME IN AND

02:12:04.449 --> 02:12:07.853
WATCHING HIS CAREER IS THAT.

02:12:07.919 --> 02:12:09.521
THEY'RE NOW REALLY FOCUSING ON

02:12:09.588 --> 02:12:11.390
GETTING PEOPLE WITH DIVERSE

02:12:11.456 --> 02:12:13.091
SKILLS TO COME AND WORK

02:12:13.158 --> 02:12:14.526
TOGETHER SO ONE OF THINGS WE

02:12:14.593 --> 02:12:16.295
EMPHASIZE IT MIGHT IS FIRST OF

02:12:16.361 --> 02:12:17.195
ALL A LOT OF OUR SOFTWARE

02:12:17.262 --> 02:12:18.597
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMING BECAUSE

02:12:18.664 --> 02:12:20.499
THAT'S BEST PRACTICE NOW. BUT

02:12:20.565 --> 02:12:22.768
ALSO AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF

02:12:22.834 --> 02:12:26.238
EFFORT IS ON TRAINING. OUR

02:12:26.305 --> 02:12:27.406
STUDENTS TO WORK IN DIVERSE

02:12:27.472 --> 02:12:29.741
TEAMS. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

02:12:29.808 --> 02:12:31.143
PEOPLE FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS

02:12:31.209 --> 02:12:32.344
ARE PERSPECTIVES AND I'M NOT

02:12:32.411 --> 02:12:33.879
TALKING NESTLE ABOUT RACE OR

02:12:33.945 --> 02:12:34.880
GENDER THOUGH THAT'S PART OF

02:12:34.946 --> 02:12:36.982
IT. ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS

02:12:37.049 --> 02:12:38.383
IS ANOTHER PART OF IT THEY

02:12:38.450 --> 02:12:40.419
BRING DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES

02:12:40.485 --> 02:12:41.186
AND THAT CREATES BETTER

02:12:41.253 --> 02:12:44.589
SOLUTIONS SO YOU KNOW THAT.

02:12:44.656 --> 02:12:46.792
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT WE HAVE

02:12:46.858 --> 02:12:49.528
MAJOR ISSUES ABOUT PAY EQUITY I

02:12:49.594 --> 02:12:50.762
MEAN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S

02:12:50.829 --> 02:12:51.930
HAPPENING AT MODE RIGHT NOW IS

02:12:51.997 --> 02:12:53.131
YOUR HAVE TO MAJOR IN COMPUTER

02:12:53.198 --> 02:12:54.533
SCIENCE TO GET PAID A HUNDRED

02:12:54.599 --> 02:12:55.467
FIFTY K. PER YEAR WHEN YOU

02:12:55.534 --> 02:12:56.868
GRADUATE. YOU JUST HAVE TO TAKE

02:12:56.935 --> 02:12:58.036
THE FIRST THREE COURSES IN

02:12:58.103 --> 02:12:59.604
SEQUENCE AND GOOGLE OR

02:12:59.671 --> 02:13:02.107
MICROSOFT OR- APPLE FOR WHOEVER

02:13:02.174 --> 02:13:04.242
WILL HIRE YOU. BECAUSE THEY

02:13:04.309 --> 02:13:05.877
HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THOSE

02:13:05.944 --> 02:13:07.512
STUDENTS ARE GOING TO DO JUST

02:13:07.579 --> 02:13:09.281
FINE THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

02:13:09.348 --> 02:13:11.983
POSITION. MEANING THE BY OR

02:13:12.050 --> 02:13:13.385
MAJOR SINK. PHYSICS AND-

02:13:13.452 --> 02:13:14.286
ENGINEER AND NOT GO TO GRAD

02:13:14.353 --> 02:13:16.555
SCHOOL OR NOT GOING INTO OTHER

02:13:16.621 --> 02:13:18.824
AREAS ANYMORE BECAUSE- THERE'S

02:13:18.890 --> 02:13:21.927
JUST THIS. VACUUM SUCKING

02:13:21.993 --> 02:13:23.462
PEOPLE INTO SOFTWARE

02:13:23.528 --> 02:13:26.898
ENGINEERING THINGS SO THESE ARE

02:13:26.965 --> 02:13:29.968
LOTS OF PROBLEMS TO SOLVE. I

02:13:30.035 --> 02:13:33.372
THINK THE REASON I'M SO HAPPY

02:13:33.438 --> 02:13:36.341
TO BE HERE TO BE TALKING. TO

02:13:36.408 --> 02:13:39.244
YOU IS BECAUSE- I DO THINK

02:13:39.311 --> 02:13:40.512
CALIFORNIA IT NEEDS TO GET OUT

02:13:40.579 --> 02:13:44.249
IN FRONT OF IT. WE CERTAINLY

02:13:44.316 --> 02:13:46.952
HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF STUDENTS

02:13:47.018 --> 02:13:49.087
WHO ARE UNDERREPRESENTED

02:13:49.154 --> 02:13:51.323
MINORITIES IN OUR SCHOOLS. WE

02:13:51.390 --> 02:13:52.591
HAVE A LOT OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE

02:13:52.657 --> 02:13:57.796
LEARNERS. THIS IS A PLACE WHERE

02:13:57.863 --> 02:14:00.132
IF WE REALLY WANT OUR TECH

02:14:00.198 --> 02:14:02.434
ECONOMY TO CONTINUE AND RIGHT

02:14:02.501 --> 02:14:03.301
NOW EVERYTHING'S A TECH

02:14:03.368 --> 02:14:05.203
HEALTHCARE IS A TECH ECONOMY

02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:06.805
ENTERTAINMENT TO TECH ECONOMY

02:14:06.872 --> 02:14:08.640
EVERYTHING IS A TECH CON WE

02:14:08.707 --> 02:14:10.142
REALLY WANT TO CONTINUE TO LEAD

02:14:10.208 --> 02:14:11.877
THE COUNTRY IN DOING THAT WE'VE

02:14:11.943 --> 02:14:14.212
GOT TO FIX WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

02:14:14.279 --> 02:14:16.114
OUR SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES

02:14:16.181 --> 02:14:19.684
AND IN. OUR ADULT EDUCATION FOR

02:14:19.751 --> 02:14:21.686
TOTALLY TOTALLY AGREE WITH THAT

02:14:21.753 --> 02:14:23.855
AND YOU KNOW JUST- WILL BE A

02:14:23.922 --> 02:14:24.523
LOOPING IT BACK TO THE

02:14:24.589 --> 02:14:25.424
DISCUSSION WE WERE HAVING YOU

02:14:25.490 --> 02:14:28.627
KNOW IF. IF OUR GOAL YOU KNOW

02:14:28.693 --> 02:14:31.263
IS TO INCREASE PROSPERITY THEN-

02:14:31.329 --> 02:14:32.664
I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE

02:14:32.731 --> 02:14:34.332
AREN'T WE- IDENTIFY THOSE

02:14:34.399 --> 02:14:35.834
UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES BECAUSE

02:14:35.901 --> 02:14:38.870
I MEAN THE OTHER'S GIGS. THE

02:14:38.937 --> 02:14:40.005
EXISTENCE OF THESE I MEAN JUST

02:14:40.071 --> 02:14:41.173
BE CALLED SUPER PROGRAMMERS

02:14:41.239 --> 02:14:42.707
WRITE THESE THESE PEOPLE WITH

02:14:42.774 --> 02:14:44.910
VERY HIGH PRODUCTIVITY IN

02:14:44.976 --> 02:14:46.344
SOFTWARE ENGINEERING- THOSE

02:14:46.411 --> 02:14:47.245
PEOPLE ARE ABOUT I HAVE BEEN

02:14:47.312 --> 02:14:48.180
UNDER. THE UNDERSERVED

02:14:48.246 --> 02:14:49.047
COMMUNITIES THAT YOU KNOW

02:14:49.114 --> 02:14:50.415
THAT'S WHERE THE SUPPLY AS AND

02:14:50.482 --> 02:14:51.316
SO THAT'S WHY I THINK WE NEED

02:14:51.383 --> 02:14:52.851
TO FOCUS ON THEM BUT IT'S GOING

02:14:52.918 --> 02:14:54.252
TO BE AN INTERESTING PROBLEM

02:14:54.319 --> 02:14:56.588
FOR. SOCIETY TO SOLVE YOU KNOW

02:14:56.655 --> 02:14:58.490
HOW TO HOW TO BALANCE THIS-

02:14:58.557 --> 02:14:59.825
HAVE COMPENSATION AGAINST

02:14:59.891 --> 02:15:02.194
PRODUCTIVITY BECAUSE I DON'T

02:15:02.260 --> 02:15:02.761
THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

02:15:02.828 --> 02:15:04.029
HAVE ARMS AROUND. LIKE TO GIVE

02:15:04.095 --> 02:15:05.096
YOU HAVE MISSED WHEN I TALK

02:15:05.163 --> 02:15:07.632
ABOUT THAT SYSTEMIC AS IN A

02:15:07.699 --> 02:15:08.533
PARADIGM SHIFT I THINK IT'S

02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:10.368
WHAT ELLIE WAS TALKING ABOUT.

02:15:10.435 --> 02:15:12.537
MOST OFTEN NOW WHEN WE GO INTO

02:15:12.604 --> 02:15:15.040
A CLASSROOM. THERE'S NOT EVEN A

02:15:15.106 --> 02:15:17.676
SENSE OF PLAY AN ELEMENTARY

02:15:17.742 --> 02:15:19.911
SCHOOL IN LOWER GRADES BECAUSE

02:15:19.978 --> 02:15:21.746
THEY'RE SO FOCUSED OF WANTING

02:15:21.813 --> 02:15:24.115
TO. DO CERTAIN THINGS AT THE

02:15:24.182 --> 02:15:26.117
SAME TIME FOR EVERY SINGLE

02:15:26.184 --> 02:15:28.653
CLASSROOM. THERE'S NOT TIME FOR

02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:30.989
THEM TO KIND OF EXPLORE. IN NOT

02:15:31.056 --> 02:15:32.858
THE PART TO ME LIKE WHEN I WAS

02:15:32.924 --> 02:15:34.092
IN HIGH SCHOOL WHICH WAS I

02:15:34.159 --> 02:15:35.393
GRADUATED IN NINETY THREE IN

02:15:35.460 --> 02:15:38.263
HIGH SCHOOL BUT- I WAS ABLE TO

02:15:38.330 --> 02:15:40.298
DO THAT. I WAS ABLE TO DO THAT

02:15:40.365 --> 02:15:42.334
IN MIDDLE AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:45.370
DEAR STIS SETS OF ALL. IN WHICH

02:15:45.437 --> 02:15:47.472
HIGH NEED TO PUT IT IN BASED ON

02:15:47.539 --> 02:15:49.174
WE KNOW PUTTING IN COMMON CORE-

02:15:49.241 --> 02:15:52.577
STATE SANDERS WE DID AND GSS

02:15:52.644 --> 02:15:54.279
BUT WE STILL ARE CONSTRAINED AS

02:15:54.346 --> 02:15:57.015
TEACHERS TO EXPLORE DIFFERENT

02:15:57.082 --> 02:15:59.251
INCLUDE HOW TO. IMPART THAT

02:15:59.317 --> 02:16:03.355
MISSION THAT'S PART OF PLAY.

02:16:03.421 --> 02:16:05.423
LIKE WHAT'S CONSTRAINT PART OF

02:16:05.490 --> 02:16:07.158
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS

02:16:07.225 --> 02:16:10.028
PASSION OR JUST A JOB BECAUSE

02:16:10.095 --> 02:16:12.664
THAT THERE IS THAT. WHERE HEY I

02:16:12.731 --> 02:16:14.733
COULD GET HUNDRED FIFTY

02:16:14.799 --> 02:16:16.368
THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO I'LL JUST

02:16:16.434 --> 02:16:17.502
GO AHEAD AND GO INTO COMPUTER

02:16:17.569 --> 02:16:19.104
SCIENCE AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS

02:16:19.170 --> 02:16:21.840
ONE PERSON THAT DAY LEAD LIVE

02:16:21.907 --> 02:16:24.309
AND BREATHE IT. SOLD WE NEED TO

02:16:24.376 --> 02:16:26.444
BE ABLE TO IMPART THAT PASSION

02:16:26.511 --> 02:16:29.147
FOR STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO SEE

02:16:29.214 --> 02:16:32.183
THAT. BUT WE CAN'T IF WE DON'T

02:16:32.250 --> 02:16:34.920
GIVE OUR TEACHERS CHANCE TO

02:16:34.986 --> 02:16:37.622
CHANGE THE WITH THE WITH THE IN

02:16:37.689 --> 02:16:39.524
THE CLASSROOM. TO IT FUN FOR

02:16:39.591 --> 02:16:47.465
THIS. IT'S A THAT TO ME I THINK

02:16:47.532 --> 02:16:49.434
IS THE- THING. THAT WE DO

02:16:49.501 --> 02:16:50.001
BECAUSE THEY WALK IN THE YOU

02:16:50.068 --> 02:16:51.736
SAID G

02:16:51.803 --> 02:16:54.573
LLEGE WAY IT'S A BOOK. IT'S

02:16:54.639 --> 02:16:55.473
ABOUT THE BOOK IT'S ABOUT THE

02:16:55.540 --> 02:16:56.207
BIGGER PICTURE AND I THINK THAT

02:16:56.274 --> 02:16:57.542
THE PART THAT WE NEED TO KIND

02:16:57.609 --> 02:16:58.276
OF GRAPPLE WITH I'M WE CAN

02:16:58.343 --> 02:17:03.081

THANK YOU SO OF. ASSEMBLY

02:17:04.282 --> 02:17:07.352

02:17:07.419 --> 02:17:08.587
PICKING UP ON THAT YES IT WILL

02:17:08.653 --> 02:17:11.489
YOU YOU BOTH MENTIONED I'M LEON

02:17:11.556 --> 02:17:13.491
MENTIONED. SOME OF THE REALLY

02:17:13.558 --> 02:17:14.893
HUGE HUGE AND FUNDAMENTAL

02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:17.729
CHALLENGES WERE FACING AND YOUR

02:17:17.796 --> 02:17:19.664
K. THROUGH TWELVE CLASSROOMS

02:17:19.731 --> 02:17:21.333
AND- IT KIND OF COMES DOWN TO

02:17:21.399 --> 02:17:23.501
THE FACT THAT WE ARE STILL IN

02:17:23.568 --> 02:17:25.236
MANY WAYS. EDUCATING OUR

02:17:25.303 --> 02:17:27.305
STUDENTS FOR THE INDUSTRIAL

02:17:27.372 --> 02:17:29.074
REVOLUTION RIGHT RIGHT AND YOU

02:17:29.140 --> 02:17:31.242
KNOW TO DO THOSE KINDS OF JOBS

02:17:31.309 --> 02:17:34.279
AND- I'M IN THE PATH FROM WHERE

02:17:34.346 --> 02:17:37.082
WE ARE. TOO HIGH A CLASSROOM

02:17:37.148 --> 02:17:38.450
ENVIRONMENT THAT ACTUALLY

02:17:38.516 --> 02:17:42.787
PREPARES OUR STUDENTS IN AN

02:17:42.854 --> 02:17:44.089
INTEGRATED AT AN INCLUSIVE WAY

02:17:44.155 --> 02:17:47.892
FOR THE JOB. TOMORROW AND THERE

02:17:47.959 --> 02:17:48.994
IS I YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT

02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:49.761
THAT WE NEED TO DO AND YOU YOU

02:17:49.828 --> 02:17:51.229
MENTIONED MANY OF THOSE THINGS.

02:17:51.296 --> 02:17:52.564
SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IF

02:17:52.631 --> 02:17:54.866
YOU I'M YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE ABLE

02:17:54.933 --> 02:17:57.135
TO TELL US ONE THING. ONE THING

02:17:57.202 --> 02:17:59.070
THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE US DO

02:17:59.137 --> 02:18:00.872
YOU THIS YEAR WHAT WOULD IT BE.

02:18:00.939 --> 02:18:03.074
I'M STARTING WITH. ME FOR

02:18:03.141 --> 02:18:03.742
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN

02:18:03.808 --> 02:18:06.277
PARTICULAR- THEY SHOULD HAVE A

02:18:06.344 --> 02:18:10.548
HUB. THAT ALL EITHER- BY GRADE

02:18:10.615 --> 02:18:11.750
LEVELS BECAUSE WHEN IT IS

02:18:11.816 --> 02:18:12.784
ACTUALLY ANTED TEACHERS

02:18:12.851 --> 02:18:14.319
ACTUALLY SAID THIS TO ME. WE'RE

02:18:14.386 --> 02:18:15.787
DATE THEY COULD GO AND

02:18:15.854 --> 02:18:17.689
EVERYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH

02:18:17.756 --> 02:18:19.758
STEM IS THAT. THEN I'D AS A

02:18:19.824 --> 02:18:22.093
TEACHER COULD COME IN AND LOOK

02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:23.762
AT WHAT THEY HAVE AND THEN

02:18:23.828 --> 02:18:26.031
BRING IN STUDENTS SAN AND THEN

02:18:26.097 --> 02:18:28.466
JUST HAVE THEM EXPLORE. INSTILL

02:18:28.533 --> 02:18:30.835
IN ESSENCE INCORPORATING

02:18:30.902 --> 02:18:34.673
READING WRITING. MATHEMATICS

02:18:34.739 --> 02:18:36.641
BUT NOW IT'S IN PLAY. OUR

02:18:36.708 --> 02:18:39.411
CLASSROOM DOES NOT LOOK LIKE

02:18:39.477 --> 02:18:42.280
WHAT YOU SEE IN GOOGLE WHERE

02:18:42.347 --> 02:18:44.282
IT'S LIKE STILL EITHER ALL

02:18:44.349 --> 02:18:46.584
CHAIRS DESK YOU KNOW IN LINE

02:18:46.651 --> 02:18:48.186
SOMETHING WE ARE CHANGING

02:18:48.253 --> 02:18:50.221
THERE'S ARE THERE ARE TEACHERS

02:18:50.288 --> 02:18:52.357
THAT HAVE CHANGED THAT WHERE WE

02:18:52.424 --> 02:18:54.325
HAVE MOVABLE YOU KNOW I'M I

02:18:54.392 --> 02:18:56.227
GUESS. WE'LL SEE THAT'S CORRECT

02:18:56.294 --> 02:18:57.962
BUT THE PROBLEM THOUGH IS THAT

02:18:58.029 --> 02:19:00.265
THERE'S NO MONEY TO BE ABLE TO

02:19:00.331 --> 02:19:00.965
DO THAT FOR EVERY SINGLE

02:19:01.032 --> 02:19:03.635
SCHOOL. SOLD MOST OFTEN

02:19:03.702 --> 02:19:06.104
TEACHERS WOULD ACTUALLY PAY ON

02:19:06.171 --> 02:19:08.273
THEIR OWN MONEY TO BE ABLE TO

02:19:08.339 --> 02:19:13.044
DO THAT. SO I. IF I WERE GONNA

02:19:13.111 --> 02:19:16.247
TRY AND DO ONE THING I WOULD.

02:19:16.314 --> 02:19:21.453
IMPROVE THE PAY AND THE RESPECT.

02:19:21.519 --> 02:19:23.521
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TEACHING AT

02:19:23.588 --> 02:19:27.092
ALL LEVELS. BECAUSE ONE OF THE

02:19:27.158 --> 02:19:29.294
REALLY BIG PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW

02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:33.098
IS THAT IF YOU'RE PAID TO BE AN

02:19:33.164 --> 02:19:35.600
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER IS

02:19:35.667 --> 02:19:36.401
SIXTY THOUSAND PER YEAR I DON'T

02:19:36.468 --> 02:19:38.203
KNOW I'M GUESSING- I KNOW IT'S

02:19:38.269 --> 02:19:41.906
HIGHER IN SOME PLACES. AND IF

02:19:41.973 --> 02:19:43.641
YOU'RE PAID TO BE STARTING A

02:19:43.708 --> 02:19:45.910
SOFTWARE ENGINEER IS A HUNDRED

02:19:45.977 --> 02:19:48.246
FIFTY K. I MEAN EVEN JUST EIGHT

02:19:48.313 --> 02:19:49.547
UNIVERSITY LEVELS WHAT WE'RE

02:19:49.614 --> 02:19:51.583
LOOKING AT IS. ONE OF OUR

02:19:51.649 --> 02:19:53.184
GRADUATES CAN GET A HUNDRED

02:19:53.251 --> 02:19:54.919
FIFTY K. SOMEBODY WHO GOES AND

02:19:54.986 --> 02:19:57.288
GETS A PEACH TEA. AND THEN

02:19:57.355 --> 02:19:58.990
COMES BACK AND TEACHES IS GONNA

02:19:59.057 --> 02:20:01.393
BE SOMEPLACE BETWEEN A HUNDRED

02:20:01.459 --> 02:20:03.428
AND FIVE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY K.

02:20:03.495 --> 02:20:05.530
SO SIGNIFICANTLY LESS. SO YOU

02:20:05.597 --> 02:20:08.767
YOU KNOW. I REALLY THINK THAT

02:20:08.833 --> 02:20:11.803
WE NEED TO. WE NEED TO MAKE IT

02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:13.838
POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE TO

02:20:13.905 --> 02:20:15.940
TEACH AND MOTIVATE PEOPLE FOR

02:20:16.007 --> 02:20:17.442
THEIR THEIR TEACHING ADULT

02:20:17.509 --> 02:20:19.177
STUDENTS OR TEACHING COULD PRE

02:20:19.244 --> 02:20:21.446
KINDERGARTEN STUDENTS WE NEED

02:20:21.513 --> 02:20:23.114
TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THOSE

02:20:23.181 --> 02:20:26.117
PEOPLE TO CHOOSE CAREERS AND I

02:20:26.184 --> 02:20:28.286
REALLY THINK RIGHT NOW. WE'RE

02:20:28.353 --> 02:20:29.454
CERTAINLY NOT THE OUR STATE IN

02:20:29.521 --> 02:20:31.055
THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF HOW WE

02:20:31.122 --> 02:20:33.324
PAY OUR TEACHERS. BUT I YOU

02:20:33.391 --> 02:20:37.529
KNOW I'M- I GREW UP IN CANADA.

02:20:37.595 --> 02:20:38.997
WHEN I WAS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF

02:20:39.063 --> 02:20:40.698
BRITISH COLUMBIA THE STARTING

02:20:40.765 --> 02:20:42.200
SALARY FOR A FACULTY MEMBER IN

02:20:42.267 --> 02:20:44.102
THE FLOPPY OF EDUCATION WAS THE

02:20:44.169 --> 02:20:46.571
SAME AS THE SALARY FOR SOMEBODY

02:20:46.638 --> 02:20:48.339
WHO BEEN TEACHING FOR. EIGHT

02:20:48.406 --> 02:20:52.177
YEARS. SO THEY WERE AND IT WAS

02:20:52.243 --> 02:20:55.146
REGARDED AS YOU KNOW IF YOU

02:20:55.213 --> 02:20:55.680
WERE AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

02:20:55.747 --> 02:20:57.782
TEACHER. AND YOU WERE DOING A

02:20:57.849 --> 02:20:59.484
GREAT JOB YOU WERE JUST AS

02:20:59.551 --> 02:21:00.985
IMPORTANT AS A FACULTY MEMBER

02:21:01.052 --> 02:21:04.422
AT THE UNIVERSITY. SO I THINK

02:21:04.489 --> 02:21:06.191
THAT WE NEED A SHIFT IN TERMS

02:21:06.257 --> 02:21:08.259
OF OUR VALUE SYSTEM AND THAT

02:21:08.326 --> 02:21:10.461
ALSO ENTAILS A SHIFT IN TERMS

02:21:10.528 --> 02:21:14.132
OF. PAY SO I THINK WE'RE GONNA

02:21:14.199 --> 02:21:15.066
TALK A LOT ABOUT FUNDING

02:21:15.133 --> 02:21:17.669
CLEARLY- I WOULD LOOK TO LAST

02:21:17.735 --> 02:21:19.370
YEAR'S- COMPUTER SCIENCE

02:21:19.437 --> 02:21:20.805
STANDARDS THAT WERE ADOPTED BY

02:21:20.872 --> 02:21:22.373
THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION.

02:21:22.440 --> 02:21:23.141
THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT

02:21:23.208 --> 02:21:24.843
THEM WAS THE CAN'T BE A MANDATE

02:21:24.909 --> 02:21:25.844
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO FUNDING

02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:27.145
ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AND SO

02:21:27.212 --> 02:21:28.446
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT WE

02:21:28.513 --> 02:21:29.380
FUND THOSE THINGS AND

02:21:29.447 --> 02:21:31.182
IMPLEMENTS THE REQUIREMENTS OF

02:21:31.249 --> 02:21:32.550
THE COMPUTER SCIENCE STANDARDS.

02:21:32.617 --> 02:21:34.252
INTO THE CLASSROOMS ON A DAILY

02:21:34.319 --> 02:21:36.521
BASIS THAT BECAUSE IT'S AN

02:21:36.588 --> 02:21:38.022
UNFUNDED MANDATE IT IT ISN'T

02:21:38.089 --> 02:21:40.491
CURRENTLY. ROCK IN CLASSROOMS A

02:21:40.558 --> 02:21:41.659
LOT OF THOSE STANDARDS INCLUDE

02:21:41.726 --> 02:21:42.393
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU

02:21:42.460 --> 02:21:43.995
WERE TALKING ABOUT OF ENSURING

02:21:44.062 --> 02:21:45.964
THAT THERE ITS ACTIVITY BASED-

02:21:46.030 --> 02:21:47.999
PLAY LIKE THINGS SO THEY

02:21:48.066 --> 02:21:48.933
UNDERSTAND WHAT COMPUTER

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:50.401
SCIENCE LOOKS LIKE BUT YOU

02:21:50.468 --> 02:21:51.436
CAN'T REQUIRE. THE

02:21:51.502 --> 02:21:52.470
IMPLEMENTATION OF COMPUTER

02:21:52.537 --> 02:21:54.272
SCIENCE THE CLASSROOM WITHOUT

02:21:54.339 --> 02:21:57.475
IT THE FUNDING. HI IF I COULD

02:21:57.542 --> 02:21:59.244
DO A MAY. WAND AND THE

02:21:59.310 --> 02:22:01.980
ASPIRATIONAL OUT. THE POLICY

02:22:02.046 --> 02:22:02.747
ITEM THAT COULD BE DONE IT

02:22:02.814 --> 02:22:05.016
WOULD BE- MANDATING AND FUNDING

02:22:05.083 --> 02:22:06.718
ALL PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS IN

02:22:06.784 --> 02:22:08.219
CALIFORNIA TEACH COMPUTER

02:22:08.286 --> 02:22:09.220
SCIENCE NOT TO SAY EVERY

02:22:09.287 --> 02:22:10.588
STUDENT HAS TO TAKE IT BUT-

02:22:10.655 --> 02:22:12.523
EVERY SINGLE PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL

02:22:12.590 --> 02:22:13.625
MUST OFFER COMPUTER SCIENCE.

02:22:13.691 --> 02:22:15.593
THAT IS GOING TO BE HARD TO DO

02:22:15.660 --> 02:22:18.296
IN ONE SESSION- IS SO IS THAT

02:22:18.363 --> 02:22:18.796
IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:22:18.863 --> 02:22:20.031
REALISTIC AND MANY OF US IN
