AUDITOR TO DOING TO. AND FOUND

00:25:33.131 --> 00:25:34.499
THAT THERE IS ABOUT THIRTY ONE

00:25:34.566 --> 00:25:35.967
BILLION DOLLARS IN FRAUD. IN

00:25:36.034 --> 00:25:37.335
THE PRISON SYSTEM THAT WAS

THOUGHT THIRTY ONE BILLION WAS

00:25:46.077 --> 00:25:47.312
THE GLOBAL NUMBER TOLERATE

00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:48.813
STILL I'VE NEVER. THE TOTAL

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:49.948
NUMBER AND A LARGE PERCENTAGE

00:25:50.015 --> 00:25:51.049
OF THAT CAME FROM THE PRISON

00:25:51.116 --> 00:25:53.051
SYSTEM. AND THAT'S WHY A SIMPLE

00:25:53.118 --> 00:25:54.352
SOLUTION THAT THE AUDITOR

00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:56.154
RECOMMENDED WOULD BE SB THIRTY

00:25:56.221 --> 00:26:00.992
NINE WHICH. THAT'S OKAY WHAT DO

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:02.394

DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER

00:26:07.966 --> 00:26:09.501
BUT- LET'S ASSUME IT WAS A

00:26:09.567 --> 00:26:11.136
THIRTY ONE BILLION- DO WE KNOW

00:26:11.202 --> 00:26:12.671
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THAT WAS

00:26:12.737 --> 00:26:15.240
RELATED TO. PEOPLE APPLICATIONS

00:26:15.307 --> 00:26:16.741
EITHER BY OR ON BEHALF OF

00:26:16.808 --> 00:26:18.343
PEOPLE IN THE PRISON SYSTEM NO

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:19.377
I JUST KNOW THAT THE AUDITOR

00:26:19.444 --> 00:26:20.946
HAD RECOMMENDED THIS THIS

00:26:21.012 --> 00:26:21.913
MEASURE TO TAKE PLACE TO

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.281
ELIMINATE THAT FRAUD FROM

00:26:23.348 --> 00:26:24.649
HAPPENING. AND I THINK IT'S

00:26:24.716 --> 00:26:26.584
BECAUSE US AS LEGISLATORS AND

00:26:26.651 --> 00:26:28.219
IN. INDIVIDUALS AND CONTROL OF

00:26:28.286 --> 00:26:29.554
TAXPAYER DOLLARS THAT WE DO

00:26:29.621 --> 00:26:30.155
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PREVENT

00:26:30.221 --> 00:26:31.589
FRAUD WITHIN THE SYSTEM. IS

00:26:31.656 --> 00:26:33.558
JUST ONE MEASURE ABSOLUTELY BUT

00:26:33.625 --> 00:26:34.225
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IN

00:26:34.292 --> 00:26:36.361
TERMS OF. WITH THIS LIKE A BIG

00:26:36.428 --> 00:26:37.762
PART OF THE PROBLEM OR A SMALL

00:26:37.829 --> 00:26:39.731
PART OF THE PROBLEM. SO I DON'T

00:26:39.798 --> 00:26:40.332
KNOW I'D BE GLAD TO GET THAT

00:26:40.398 --> 00:26:41.666
INFORMATION BACK TO YOU AND I

00:26:41.733 --> 00:26:44.703
DO APOLOGIZE I DON'T HAVE THE

00:26:44.769 --> 00:26:50.675
ANSWER FOR THAT FOR YOU.

00:26:50.742 --> 00:26:52.644
LECTURE MIGHT HAVE A RESPONSE

00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:54.412
TO YOUR QUESTION A SENATOR

00:26:54.479 --> 00:26:57.682
WARNER IF YOU'RE- HOW MUCH OF

00:26:57.749 --> 00:26:59.417
THIS ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION BUT

00:26:59.484 --> 00:27:01.119
I BELIEVE HERE IT STATES THAT.

00:27:01.186 --> 00:27:03.688
WHILE THE EXACT TOTALS BY KNOWN

00:27:03.755 --> 00:27:05.290
OR UNKNOWN IN MAY TO STATE

00:27:05.357 --> 00:27:06.257
PRISONS ALONE HAVE BEEN

00:27:06.324 --> 00:27:08.693
ESTIMATED TO COMPRISE AT LEAST

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.628
FOUR HUNDRED MILLION. IS THAT

00:27:10.695 --> 00:27:14.232
YOUR- OF THE THIRTY OF THE

00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:15.066
THIRTY ONE BILLION I THINK

00:27:15.133 --> 00:27:16.701
THAT'S A COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SIR

00:27:16.768 --> 00:27:19.838
YES YEAH THAT WOULD BE ABOUT

00:27:19.904 --> 00:27:27.178
ONE LITTLE OVER 1% IS A TALKER.

00:27:27.245 --> 00:27:28.179
AND I APPRECIATE YOUR

00:27:28.246 --> 00:27:30.648
QUESTIONS- FOUR HUNDRED MILLION

00:27:30.715 --> 00:27:32.517
IS STILL FOUR HUNDRED MILLION

00:27:32.584 --> 00:27:33.051
DOLLARS IT'S A TREMENDOUS

00:27:33.118 --> 00:27:37.022
AMOUNT OF MONEY. INTERCOM WATER.

00:27:37.088 --> 00:27:39.190
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I AM.

00:27:39.257 --> 00:27:41.860
ALSO HAD SIMILAR QUESTIONS I

00:27:41.926 --> 00:27:44.329
KNOW IN THE AUDIT REPORT THAT

00:27:44.396 --> 00:27:46.931
WE LOOKED AT MY UNDERSTANDING

00:27:46.998 --> 00:27:51.302
WAS THAT THE THEM. LARGE END OF

00:27:51.369 --> 00:27:52.470
THAT NUMBER THIRTY ONE BILLION

00:27:52.537 --> 00:27:54.572
WAS THE GLOBAL AMOUNT OF FRAUD

00:27:54.639 --> 00:27:56.174
NOT NECESSARILY THE FRAUD

00:27:56.241 --> 00:27:57.475
COMMITTED BY INCARCERATED

00:27:57.542 --> 00:28:00.912
PERSONS AND I TOO WAS CURIOUS-

00:28:00.979 --> 00:28:05.884
IF YOU HAD DATA- THAT SHOWS THE

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:07.218
AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT

00:28:07.285 --> 00:28:10.221
INCARCERATED PERSONS RECEIVED

00:28:10.288 --> 00:28:12.690
WHO WERE INTENTIONALLY-

00:28:12.757 --> 00:28:15.026
COMMITTING THE FRAUD VERSES THE

00:28:15.093 --> 00:28:17.595
AMOUNT OF MONEY. THAT WAS-

00:28:17.662 --> 00:28:19.464
FRAUDULENTLY COLLECTED BY FOLKS

00:28:19.531 --> 00:28:21.499
USING THE IDENTITY OF

00:28:21.566 --> 00:28:23.601
INCARCERATED PERSONS- TO

00:28:23.668 --> 00:28:25.336
RECEIVE BENEFITS BECAUSE I

00:28:25.403 --> 00:28:26.171
THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE

00:28:26.237 --> 00:28:27.338
BETWEEN FOLKS WHO ARE

00:28:27.405 --> 00:28:29.340
INCARCERATED WHO ARE ACTIVELY

00:28:29.407 --> 00:28:30.742
ENGAGED IN DEFRAUDING THE

00:28:30.809 --> 00:28:32.944
SYSTEM AND THEN THOSE THAT ARE

00:28:33.011 --> 00:28:35.146
ALSO VICTIMS OF IDENTITY THEFT.

00:28:35.213 --> 00:28:36.948
SO I AGREE I AM I CAN JUST TELL

00:28:37.015 --> 00:28:39.617
YOU- MESCAL MARKET THAT I

00:28:39.684 --> 00:28:42.053
SENATOR CALAMARI DEBT AM I JUST

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.288
BASE THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION

00:28:43.354 --> 00:28:44.222
ON THE AUDITOR'S

00:28:44.289 --> 00:28:45.256
RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE

00:28:45.323 --> 00:28:46.357
RECOMMENDATION FROM THE

00:28:46.424 --> 00:28:48.426
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR WAS TO

00:28:48.493 --> 00:28:50.929
CROSS REFERENCE- LIKE MOST

00:28:50.995 --> 00:28:52.330
STATES IN THE STATE IN THE

00:28:52.397 --> 00:28:53.932
NATION ONLY FIFTEEN STATES

00:28:53.998 --> 00:28:55.133
DON'T INCLUDING CALIFORNIA

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.102
DON'T CROSS REFERENCE. THERE SO

00:28:57.168 --> 00:28:59.070
SECURITY NUMBERS- NGUYEN ET D.

00:28:59.137 --> 00:29:00.872
PAYMENTS ARE ARE GIVEN TO THOSE

00:29:00.939 --> 00:29:02.707
THAT ARE INCARCERATED AND SO I

00:29:02.774 --> 00:29:04.342
DID IS I TOOK THIS BE SOLUTION

00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:05.910
LEGISLATION BASED ON THE

00:29:05.977 --> 00:29:07.512
AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS WE IS

00:29:07.579 --> 00:29:08.546
AN INDEPENDENT AUDITOR THAT

00:29:08.613 --> 00:29:11.449
MADE THE RECOMMENDATION TO DO A

00:29:11.516 --> 00:29:12.016
PIECE LEGISLATION TO PREVENT

00:29:12.083 --> 00:29:14.319
FRAUD. HAS HAS EIGHTY D. GIVEN

00:29:14.385 --> 00:29:15.887
YOU ANY INDICATION ABOUT THEIR

00:29:15.954 --> 00:29:18.823
ABILITY TO. ACCOMPLISH THIS

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:20.892
GIVEN THEIR CURRENT CHALLENGES.

00:29:20.959 --> 00:29:22.961
M. NOBLE ET DE AT ONE OF THE

00:29:23.027 --> 00:29:25.063
KEY CHALLENGES THAT WE THAT-

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:26.831
THAT WAS ADDRESSED WAS IT WOULD

00:29:26.898 --> 00:29:28.099
BE DIFFICULT TO DO IT AT A

00:29:28.166 --> 00:29:29.601
LOCAL COUNTY JAILS AND SO

00:29:29.667 --> 00:29:30.435
THAT'S WHY WE TOOK THE

00:29:30.502 --> 00:29:32.170
COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TO ONLY

00:29:32.237 --> 00:29:33.471
DO AT THE STATE LEVEL AT THIS

00:29:33.538 --> 00:29:36.541
AT THIS TIME. AND LIKE I SAID

00:29:36.608 --> 00:29:37.775
WE'RE JUST ONE OF FIFTEEN

00:29:37.842 --> 00:29:39.043
STATES THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:40.044
THIS AND IT WOULD PREVENT A

00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:41.412
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FRAUD

00:29:41.479 --> 00:29:42.647
WHETHER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION

00:29:42.714 --> 00:29:45.783
DOLLARS AS THE ESTIMATE IS. IS

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:47.218
MINIMAL TO SOME PEOPLE OR

00:29:47.285 --> 00:29:49.988
SIGNIFICANT. AND THEN MY FINAL

00:29:50.054 --> 00:29:52.790
QUESTION MISTER CHAIR HAS THE-

00:29:52.857 --> 00:29:55.927
ACCEPTED. AMENDMENTS REMOVED

00:29:55.994 --> 00:29:57.962
OPPOSITION FROM INITIATE

00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:59.497
JUSTICE LEGAL AID AT WORK I

00:29:59.564 --> 00:30:00.598
HEARD THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S

00:30:00.665 --> 00:30:02.534
OFFICE ON THE PHONE BUT HAS IT

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.168
REMOVED THE OTHER OPPOSITION DO

00:30:03.234 --> 00:30:06.204
WE KNOW. SO NOT THAT I KNOW OF

00:30:06.271 --> 00:30:07.872
NO ONE IS CONTACTED MY OFFICE

00:30:07.939 --> 00:30:09.774
TO REMOVE THAT OPPOSITION- AND

00:30:09.841 --> 00:30:12.744
AGAIN. IN AN IN THE REAL WORLD

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:13.845
I GUESS I WOULD SAY IS HOW

00:30:13.912 --> 00:30:15.747
EXPLAIN IT I'M A BUSINESS OWNER

00:30:15.813 --> 00:30:18.116
AND- WE EMPLOYEE. 40% OF THE

00:30:18.183 --> 00:30:19.250
PEOPLE THAT WE EMPLOYER SECOND

00:30:19.317 --> 00:30:20.652
CHANCER IS WHAT WE CALL SECOND

00:30:20.718 --> 00:30:21.619
CHANCE THERE'S THOSE THAT HAVE

00:30:21.686 --> 00:30:23.054
BEEN INCARCERATED AND WANT TO

00:30:23.121 --> 00:30:24.122
COME OUT AND HAVE A BETTER

00:30:24.189 --> 00:30:25.557
LIFE. AND WE'VE HAD A LOT OF

00:30:25.623 --> 00:30:26.558
THOSE PEOPLE COME UP HERE AND

00:30:26.624 --> 00:30:28.660
TESTIFY AND CERTAIN BILLS SO

00:30:28.726 --> 00:30:30.094
THIS ISN'T AN ATTACK ON PEOPLE

00:30:30.161 --> 00:30:33.131
THAT- AND- ARE. IN THE SYSTEM

00:30:33.198 --> 00:30:34.933
OR THAT ARE TRYING TO GET OUT

00:30:34.999 --> 00:30:36.201
OF THE SYSTEM AND HAVE BENEFITS

00:30:36.267 --> 00:30:37.368
AFTER THEY GET OUT WHEN THEY

00:30:37.435 --> 00:30:38.870
BEEN GAINFULLY EMPLOYED. THIS

00:30:38.937 --> 00:30:40.672
IS JUST A MECHANISM TO TRY TO

00:30:40.738 --> 00:30:42.874
LIMIT THE FRAUD BECAUSE THIS

00:30:42.941 --> 00:30:44.642
FRAUD THAT IS BIGGER THAN WILL

00:30:44.709 --> 00:30:46.844
BE SUSTAINED BACK IN TWO

00:30:46.911 --> 00:30:48.079
THOUSAND AND EIGHT IS GONNA

00:30:48.146 --> 00:30:49.881
FONG ON THE BACKS OF A LOT OF

00:30:49.948 --> 00:30:51.015
OUR SMALL BUSINESSES AND ARE

00:30:51.082 --> 00:30:52.050
BUSINESS OWNERS. THAT HAVE BEEN

00:30:52.116 --> 00:30:53.751
STRUGGLING TO THE PANDEMIC

00:30:53.818 --> 00:30:54.752
BECAUSE IT'S 1100% EMPLOYER

00:30:54.819 --> 00:30:56.521
FUNDED SO THE MORE FRAUD THAT

00:30:56.588 --> 00:30:58.856
WE CAN ADDRESS TO REDUCE THAT

00:30:58.923 --> 00:31:02.794

DISCOVERY OF THE OFFENSE

00:47:22.339 --> 00:47:24.208
BECAUSE I WAS CONFUSED IF IT

00:47:24.274 --> 00:47:27.411
WAS. WHEN THE PHOTOS WERE TAKEN

00:47:27.477 --> 00:47:29.680
OR WHEN THEY WERE RELEASED OR

00:47:29.746 --> 00:47:31.014
WHEN THEY'RE SORT OF WHEN

00:47:31.081 --> 00:47:34.785
THEY'VE GONE VIRAL AND I

00:47:34.851 --> 00:47:37.187

ANSWER FOR THAT THANK YOU LAW

00:47:38.889 --> 00:47:41.558
INITIALLY UP ONCE. CURRENTLY

00:47:41.625 --> 00:47:43.060
RIGHT NOW WHEN THE PERPETRATOR

00:47:43.126 --> 00:47:44.494
POST THE PICTURES ONLINE SOLD

00:47:44.561 --> 00:47:46.296
THERE'S DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS

00:47:46.363 --> 00:47:48.599
DONE NOW WHEN THE VICTIM TO

00:47:48.665 --> 00:47:49.967
COME FORWARD WHEN SHE DISCOVERS

00:47:50.033 --> 00:47:51.802
HE OR SHE DISCOVERS THAT THEY

00:47:51.868 --> 00:47:53.303
FOUND THE PICTURES ONLINE AND

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:57.574
CAN GO DIRECTLY TO. AND SO WHEN

00:47:57.641 --> 00:47:59.643
IT'S WHEN THE VICTIM DOES

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:01.378
WHATEVER IS THE PICTURES ONLINE

00:48:01.445 --> 00:48:04.414
DISCOVERS THE PHOTOS OR IMAGES

00:48:04.481 --> 00:48:06.049
OR WHAT IMAGES CORRECT. AND

00:48:06.116 --> 00:48:07.985
THEN MY FINAL QUESTION SORRY IS

00:48:08.051 --> 00:48:09.886
DOES THIS INCLUDE ALL

00:48:09.953 --> 00:48:13.223
CIRCUMSTANCES WERE IMAGERY FOR

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:13.757
LACK OF A BETTER WORD WAS

00:48:13.824 --> 00:48:17.527
TAKEN- ARM. OR DOES THIS ALSO

00:48:17.594 --> 00:48:19.129
INCLUDE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE

00:48:19.196 --> 00:48:21.164
IMAGES WERE TAKEN WITH THE

00:48:21.231 --> 00:48:23.900
VICTIM'S CONSENT OR IS IT JUST

00:48:23.967 --> 00:48:25.769
WHEN IMAGES WERE TAKEN WITHOUT

00:48:25.836 --> 00:48:28.171
THAT PERSON'S KNOWLEDGE. IT'S

00:48:28.238 --> 00:48:29.773
ANY IMAGE WITH CONSENT OR

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:32.376
WITHOUT CONSENT- AS WE KNOW IF

00:48:32.442 --> 00:48:34.611
I MAY SHARE- YOU KNOW SOMETIMES

00:48:34.678 --> 00:48:35.912
PEOPLE IN A RELATIONSHIP FOR IT

00:48:35.979 --> 00:48:37.347
WHAT'S A PRIVATE MOMENT AND

00:48:37.414 --> 00:48:38.849
LATER IT'S DONE WITH MALICIOUS

00:48:38.915 --> 00:48:40.651
INTENT AND I WANTED TO SHARE A

00:48:40.717 --> 00:48:41.785
LITTLE BIT FURTHER I MEAN THEIR

00:48:41.852 --> 00:48:42.886
STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE

00:48:42.953 --> 00:48:44.521
THAT SHOW THAT 50% OF THE

00:48:44.588 --> 00:48:47.057
VICTIMS. HAVE SUICIDAL THOUGHTS

00:48:47.124 --> 00:48:48.992
ON WHETHER IT'S CONSENT OR NOT

00:48:49.059 --> 00:48:50.827
IT'S STILL EXTREMELY

00:48:50.894 --> 00:48:53.063
TRAUMATIZING USUALLY AS I

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:53.930
BELIEVE WE HEARD FROM THE

00:48:53.997 --> 00:48:55.599
WITNESS SHE WAS A TEENAGER AND

00:48:55.666 --> 00:48:56.366
IT COULD HAVE LONG LASTING

00:48:56.433 --> 00:48:58.368
EFFECTS ON PEOPLE THERE

00:48:58.435 --> 00:48:59.636
SOMEONE'S DAUGHTER SOMEONE'S

00:48:59.703 --> 00:49:01.438
MOTHER AND DEPENDING ON THE

00:49:01.505 --> 00:49:02.339
TIME LINE AT SOMEONE'S

00:49:02.406 --> 00:49:04.107
GRANDMOTHER'S CELL. EVEN WITH

00:49:04.174 --> 00:49:05.842
CONSENT IT IS SOMETHING THAT

00:49:05.909 --> 00:49:07.377
SHOULD NOT BE DONE AND VICTIMS

00:49:07.444 --> 00:49:12.549
ARE REALLY STRUGGLING. AND

00:49:12.616 --> 00:49:13.150
SUFFERING THE CONSEQUENCES OF

00:49:13.216 --> 00:49:15.552
THAT TRAUMA. SO THEN IF. I FOR

00:49:15.619 --> 00:49:16.353
EXAMPLE OF I'M IN A

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:17.354
RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEONE AND

00:49:17.421 --> 00:49:20.290
WE DID. YOU KNOW ENGAGED IN

00:49:20.357 --> 00:49:21.625
SOME ACTIVITY WHERE WE'RE

00:49:45.849 --> 00:49:47.984
INTIMATE PARTNERS AND TYPICALLY

00:49:48.051 --> 00:49:49.252
THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE

00:49:49.319 --> 00:49:50.921
LONG LASTING EFFECTS ON. ON

00:49:50.987 --> 00:49:52.622

CALLED A REVENGE PORN IT'S

00:49:58.762 --> 00:50:00.797
MEANT TO TAKE REVENGE AND READY

00:50:00.864 --> 00:50:03.367
TO DAMAGE THE REPUTATION OF AN

00:50:03.433 --> 00:50:08.739
INDIVIDUAL. I THINK CONSULTANT

00:50:08.805 --> 00:50:11.975
KENNEDY WANTED TO ELABORATE ON.

00:50:12.042 --> 00:50:13.710

00:50:13.777 --> 00:50:15.479
CLARIFY THE IT IS UPON

00:50:15.545 --> 00:50:17.147
DISCOVERY AND THEN THE MEMO WAS

00:50:17.214 --> 00:50:21.084
DISCOVERY OR SIX YEARS AT THE

00:50:21.151 --> 00:50:22.519

WITHIN ONE YEAR OF DISCOVERY.

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:27.557
AND THE DISCOVERY IS WHEN THE

00:50:27.624 --> 00:50:29.359
PERSON REALIZE IT'S BEEN SHARED

00:50:29.426 --> 00:50:31.561
WITHOUT PERMISSION. AND IN YOUR

00:50:31.628 --> 00:50:33.797
SCENARIO WHERE THEY SHARE WITH

00:50:33.864 --> 00:50:34.598
THEIR FRIENDS IF THE FRIEND

00:50:34.664 --> 00:50:35.899
SHARED. THEN THAT WOULD BE

00:50:35.966 --> 00:50:38.235
WITHOUT PERMISSION. SO YOU CAN

00:50:38.301 --> 00:50:39.736
SHARE PICTURES OF YOURSELF WITH

00:50:39.803 --> 00:50:42.205

BEYOND THAT IS ONE IT'S- THE

00:50:43.707 --> 00:50:45.575
REVENGE PORN. BUT I SURE I CAN

00:50:45.642 --> 00:50:46.843
DO THAT IF I SHARE WITH MY

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:48.078
FRIENDS AND THEY DO THAT THEY

00:50:48.145 --> 00:50:50.614
CAN'T DO THAT IF I SHARE WITH

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:52.449
MY PARTNER AT THE TIME AND WE

00:50:52.516 --> 00:50:54.618
CONSENT TO SHARE BUT THEN WE

00:50:54.684 --> 00:50:56.987
BREAK UP AND THAT'S NOT

00:50:57.053 --> 00:50:58.588
PARTNER SHARES THAN THAT WOULD

00:50:58.655 --> 00:50:59.790
BE THE VIOLATION. THE

00:50:59.856 --> 00:51:02.459
MISDEMEANOR THAT'S AT THE

00:51:02.526 --> 00:51:04.961
EXISTING LINE MISTRESSES

00:51:05.028 --> 00:51:05.395

YEARS THEIR DEFINITION. THAT

00:51:15.105 --> 00:51:16.840
DEFINES AND DELINEATES WHAT

00:51:16.907 --> 00:51:18.108
REVENGE IS AND HOW THAT'S

00:51:18.175 --> 00:51:21.645
CONSTITUTED. I DON'T THINK

00:51:21.711 --> 00:51:22.245
THERE HAS TO BE INTENT BEHIND

00:51:22.312 --> 00:51:25.215
IT. I'M JUST ASKING BECAUSE YOU

00:51:25.282 --> 00:51:27.250

00:51:27.317 --> 00:51:30.120
THEN YOU KNOW I DO I JUST LIKE

00:51:30.187 --> 00:51:31.188

00:51:31.254 --> 00:51:32.689
WHEN WE'RE WINNING MOTION IS

00:51:32.756 --> 00:51:35.759

00:51:35.826 --> 00:51:37.360
EXTENSION OF EXISTING LAW

00:51:37.427 --> 00:51:39.362

SPECIALLY WITH SOCIAL MEDIA- I

00:52:52.102 --> 00:52:54.204
IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND

THESE ARE- IT CAN BE DIFFICULT

00:53:51.962 --> 00:53:54.264

SERVING FOR THE LAST YEAR ON A

00:57:32.348 --> 00:57:33.817

00:58:01.477 --> 00:58:04.347
YEAR WITH LOTS OF STAKEHOLDERS

00:58:04.414 --> 00:58:06.482
AND WHAT WE WERE DOING IS

00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:08.051
LOOKING AT CALIFORNIA'S PENAL

00:58:08.117 --> 00:58:11.254
CODE IN THE LAST THIRTY THIRTY

00:58:11.321 --> 00:58:12.488

00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:19.629
THINGS. FOR EVERYTHING UNDER

00:58:19.696 --> 00:58:23.132
THE SUN AND THERE WAS THE SENSE

00:58:23.199 --> 00:58:24.701
BY OUR FORMER GOVERNOR GOVERNOR

00:58:24.767 --> 00:58:26.402
BROWN AND OTHERS THAT WE REALLY

00:58:26.469 --> 00:58:27.670
NEEDED TO RE LOOK AT IT IN A

00:58:27.737 --> 00:58:30.039
KIND OF COMPREHENSIVE WAY SO

00:58:30.106 --> 00:58:30.673
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:33.109
WE WERE DOING. AND IN AN ISSUE

00:58:33.176 --> 00:58:34.944
THAT CAME BEFORE US WAS THE

00:58:35.011 --> 00:58:36.713
ISSUE OF WHAT'S CALLED SENTENCE

00:58:36.779 --> 00:58:39.015
ENHANCEMENTS NOW SENSING

00:58:39.082 --> 00:58:41.751
HANSON'S ARE NOT ELEMENTS OF A

00:58:41.818 --> 00:58:45.655
BASIC CRIME. SO YOU COMMIT A

00:58:45.722 --> 00:58:48.091
CRIME. SENATE HARASSMENT RATHER

00:58:48.157 --> 00:58:50.627
OUR EDITION CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

00:58:50.693 --> 00:58:53.696
A PROSECUTOR CAN ARGUE FOR. AND

00:58:53.763 --> 00:58:56.466
THEN INCREASE THE PENALTY THAT

00:58:56.532 --> 00:58:58.868
THE PERSON WHO. WOULD BE IN BE

00:58:58.935 --> 00:59:02.372
ADDED TO THE PENALTY THAT IS

00:59:02.438 --> 00:59:02.972
ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNDERLYING

00:59:03.039 --> 00:59:05.241
CRIME. CURRENTLY IN

00:59:05.308 --> 00:59:06.676
CALIFORNIA'S PENAL CODE THERE

ARE OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:59:08.945 --> 00:59:13.516
ENHANCEMENTS. AND OVER 80% OF

00:59:13.583 --> 00:59:15.318
THE PEOPLE CURRENTLY SERVING IN

00:59:15.385 --> 00:59:18.021
OUR STATE PRISONS ARE HAVE HAD

00:59:18.087 --> 00:59:19.589
DEER BASED SENTENCE OF THE

00:59:19.656 --> 00:59:21.524
SENTENCE BASED ON THE FOR THE

00:59:21.591 --> 00:59:23.126
ORIGINAL OR THE CRIME THAT THEY

00:59:23.192 --> 00:59:25.795
COMMITTED. BLANK SENT DUE TO

00:59:25.862 --> 00:59:28.798
ENHANCEMENTS AND RESEARCH SHOWS

00:59:28.865 --> 00:59:31.434
AND WE HAD LOTS OF- THERE WAS

00:59:31.501 --> 00:59:33.469
LOTS OF DATA PRESENTED TO US

00:59:33.536 --> 00:59:34.637
THERE'S A VARIETY OF

00:59:34.704 --> 00:59:36.272
RESEARCHERS WHO'VE BEEN

00:59:36.339 --> 00:59:37.907
COLLECTING DATA ON OF ON

00:59:37.974 --> 00:59:39.609
VARIOUS THINGS RELATED TO

00:59:39.676 --> 00:59:41.411
CALIFORNIA'S PENAL CODE.

00:59:41.477 --> 00:59:42.779
RESEARCH SHOWED THAT THERE'S AN

00:59:42.845 --> 00:59:44.414
INCONSISTENCY IN THE

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:46.382
APPLICATION OF THESE

00:59:46.449 --> 00:59:48.484
ENHANCEMENTS SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:59:48.551 --> 00:59:52.155
CALIFORNIA HAS A GANG LAST.

00:59:52.221 --> 00:59:54.624
THAT CAN BE REFERRED TO FOR

00:59:54.691 --> 00:59:55.491
WHEN SOMEONE ADDS A GANG

00:59:55.558 --> 00:59:58.428
ENHANCEMENT BUT IN THAT GAME

00:59:58.494 --> 01:00:02.932
CAL GANG REPORT. OF OVER FOUR

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:03.533
HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND IN

01:00:03.599 --> 01:00:07.570
THE DATABASE. ONLY

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:09.772
APPROXIMATELY THREE THOUSAND OF

01:00:09.839 --> 01:00:13.576
THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE CAUCASIAN.

01:00:13.643 --> 01:00:17.547
NOW THERE ARE A GOOD NUMER OF

01:00:17.613 --> 01:00:18.548
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DEFINITION

01:00:18.614 --> 01:00:21.484
OF GANGS GANGS THAT ACROSS THE

01:00:21.551 --> 01:00:23.619
BOARD GANGS OF THAT ARE

01:00:23.686 --> 01:00:25.121
PRIMARILY CAUCASIAN PEOPLE

01:00:25.188 --> 01:00:27.223
GETTING SORT OF PRIMARILY.

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:28.524
BLACK INDIVIDUALS GANGS THAT

01:00:28.591 --> 01:00:30.893
ARE PRIMARILY FLAT NEXT GAMES

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.230
THAT ARE PRIMARILY API HOWEVER.

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:38.868
THE GANG REPORT. IS DOMINANTLY

01:00:38.935 --> 01:00:42.438
DOMINANTLY NON CAUCASIAN NOW ON

01:00:42.505 --> 01:00:44.073
AVERAGE THE ENHANCEMENTS UNDER

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:47.243
PENAL CODE. AND THAT THEN GET

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:49.545
APPLIED CAN MORE THAN DOUBLE

01:00:49.612 --> 01:00:54.183
THE ORIGINAL SENTENCE OF THE

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:54.751
WHATEVER THE BASE CRIME WAS

01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:57.420
COMMITTED. AND IF WE THINK

01:00:57.487 --> 01:01:01.591
ABOUT. OUR PURPOSES OF

01:01:01.657 --> 01:01:05.495
INCARCERATION. YES PART OF IT

01:01:05.561 --> 01:01:08.364
IS TO HAVE A PENALTY FOR A

01:01:08.431 --> 01:01:10.500
CRIME COMMITTED BUT INITIALLY

01:01:10.566 --> 01:01:12.301
WE ARE TRYING TO CREATE SOME

01:01:12.368 --> 01:01:15.772
REHABILITATION. AND THE LONGER

01:01:15.838 --> 01:01:18.107
A PERSON SERVICE NUMBER ONE

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:19.976
IT'S A GREAT COST TO US OUR

01:01:20.043 --> 01:01:21.511
COSTS FOR INCARCERATION HOURS

01:01:21.577 --> 01:01:23.179
UPWARDS TO EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:01:23.246 --> 01:01:25.648
PER PERSON. AND IT HAS HUGE

01:01:25.715 --> 01:01:28.051
IMPACTS ON THE FAMILIES OF THE

01:01:28.117 --> 01:01:29.385
INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE YOU'VE

01:01:29.452 --> 01:01:31.320
REMOVED A POTENTIAL EARNINGS

01:01:31.387 --> 01:01:35.925
EARNED- PERSON THAT COULD EARN

01:01:35.992 --> 01:01:38.094
WAGES FROM THE HOUSEHOLD YOU'VE

01:01:38.161 --> 01:01:40.730
ALSO. REMOVED POTENTIALLY

01:01:40.797 --> 01:01:43.566
APPARENT FROM CHILDREN AND

01:01:43.633 --> 01:01:46.869
SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS SO WE WANT

01:01:46.936 --> 01:01:49.038
TO IT IS SMART FOR US TO RELOOK

01:01:49.105 --> 01:01:50.506
AT OUR PENAL CODE AND LOOK AT

01:01:50.573 --> 01:01:53.709
OUR WE APPROPRIATELY SENTENCING.

01:01:53.776 --> 01:01:59.015
SO WHAT- DURING THAT COMMITTEE

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:01.050
THAT I SERVED ON WE HAD A

01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:04.187
VARIETY OF DA'S TESTIFY AND SO

01:02:04.253 --> 01:02:06.622
FOR EXAMPLE SANTA CLARA DA JEFF

01:02:06.689 --> 01:02:08.758
ROSEN'S IN TESTIMONY TO US

01:02:08.825 --> 01:02:11.060
ABOUT ENHANCEMENTS SAID THAT IT

01:02:11.127 --> 01:02:13.062
IS QUITE COMMON NOW DUE TO THE

01:02:13.129 --> 01:02:14.730
NUMBER OF ENHANCEMENTS IN OUR

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:16.599
PENAL CODE THAT THE ENTIRE

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:18.768
TRIAL AND ALL OF THE PRE TRIAL

01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:21.437
NEGOTIATIONS END UP SOLELY

01:02:21.504 --> 01:02:24.807
ABOUT THE ENHANCEMENTS AND NOT.

01:02:24.874 --> 01:02:26.742
THE CRIME ITSELF. NOW MANY

01:02:26.809 --> 01:02:29.378
STATES HAVE BEGUN TO REFORM

01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:32.281
THEIR ENHANCEMENT PROCESS SEES.

01:02:32.348 --> 01:02:34.484
WHAT THIS BILL DOES SB EIGHTY

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:35.618
ONE IS IT DOES NOT ELIMINATE

01:02:35.685 --> 01:02:37.420
ANY ENHANCEMENT THEY ALL STAY

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:39.755
ON THE BOOKS RATHER IT GIVES

01:02:39.822 --> 01:02:42.558
MORE GUIDANCE TO OUR JUDGES IN

01:02:42.625 --> 01:02:44.927
HOW TO APPLY THEM. SO THAT

01:02:44.994 --> 01:02:46.529
THERE IS SO THAT WE CAN AS MUCH

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:49.532
AS POSSIBLE REMOVE THE KIND OF

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:51.334
ARBITRARINESS OF APPLYING

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.970
ENHANCEMENT BECAUSE THERE ARE

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:55.738
OBVIOUSLY SOME CIRCUMSTANCES

01:02:55.805 --> 01:02:56.839
WHERE AN ENHANCEMENT IS

01:02:56.906 --> 01:02:58.341
APPROPRIATE AND THAT'S WHAT

01:02:58.407 --> 01:02:59.709
WE'RE TRYING TO ENSURE IS THAT

01:02:59.775 --> 01:03:02.512
WHEN THE ENHANCEMENT IS APPLIED

01:03:02.578 --> 01:03:05.815
IT'S APPLIED APPROPRIATELY. SO

01:03:05.882 --> 01:03:09.118
WHAT IT DOES IS. GIVE THE JUDGE

01:03:09.185 --> 01:03:11.721
SOME OF FRAMEWORK SO THAT

01:03:11.787 --> 01:03:13.756
THEY'RE APPLYING AN ENHANCEMENT

01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:15.091
WHEN THERE'S CLEAR AND

01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:17.760
CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT TO NOT

01:03:17.827 --> 01:03:18.961
APPLY IT YOU WOULD BE

01:03:19.028 --> 01:03:22.532
ENDANGERING THE PUBLIC. SO YOU

01:03:22.598 --> 01:03:25.234
WOULD FOR EXAMPLE. YOU WOULD

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:27.737
USE MORE DISK NOT LESS

01:03:27.803 --> 01:03:29.739
DISCRETION ANOTHER WORDS MORE

01:03:29.805 --> 01:03:32.475
AND MORE CLARITY IF THAT WAS A

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:34.010
NONVIOLENT OFFENSE FOR EXAMPLE

01:03:34.076 --> 01:03:35.545
IF IT WAS AN OFFENCE CONNECTED

01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:37.813
TO A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE. IF

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.348
THE ENHANCEMENT WAS BASED ON A

01:03:39.415 --> 01:03:41.651
CONVICTION THAT WAS PRIOR TO

01:03:41.717 --> 01:03:43.219
FIVE YEARS AGO AND THERE HAD

01:03:43.286 --> 01:03:43.886
BEEN NO CONVICTIONS IN THE MEAN

01:03:43.953 --> 01:03:46.923
TIME OR IF THE DEFENDANT WAS A

01:03:46.989 --> 01:03:50.293
USED. BY JUVENILES WHEN THEY

01:03:50.359 --> 01:03:52.595
COMMITTED THE OFFENSE- SO

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:54.564
THAT'S THE THAT THAT IS SOME OF

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:56.933
THE GUIDANCE THAT SB EIGHTY ONE

01:03:56.999 --> 01:03:59.802
IS TRYING TO PUT INTO STATUTE

01:03:59.869 --> 01:04:01.537
SO THAT. THERE'S LESS

01:04:01.604 --> 01:04:03.439
ARBITRARINESS TO THE USE OF

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:06.142
ENHANCEMENTS AND OUR JUDGES CAN

01:04:06.209 --> 01:04:08.811
FEEL MORE CONFIDENT BECAUSE

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:12.048
RIGHT NOW IT IS LEFT. DEAD IT

01:04:12.114 --> 01:04:15.084
IS VERY- THERE'S NOT CLEARED

01:04:15.151 --> 01:04:17.587

MOST AMERICANS OWN GUNS AND IT

01:29:41.042 --> 01:29:43.911
IS VERY COMMON FOR A PERSON TO

01:29:43.978 --> 01:29:47.081
HAVE A GUN IN THEIR CAR. NOW

01:29:47.148 --> 01:29:49.350

IN THEIR CRIME BUT I HAD TO GO

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:54.702
USING THE GANG DATABASE THAT'S

01:32:54.769 --> 01:32:56.904
WHY A NUMBER OF SORT OF ACTIONS

01:32:56.971 --> 01:32:58.039
HAVE BEEN TAKEN OVER THE COURSE

01:32:58.105 --> 01:33:00.141
OF THE PAST YEAR BECAUSE WE

01:33:00.207 --> 01:33:03.110
HAVE SEEN HOW. REYES SAYS BUT

01:33:03.177 --> 01:33:05.346
JUST HOW AN EQUITABLE THE

01:33:05.413 --> 01:33:07.014
ENHANCEMENTS ARE LEVY SO I JUST

01:33:07.081 --> 01:33:08.549
WANT TO SORT OF. SHARE A LITTLE

01:33:08.616 --> 01:33:10.151
BIT OF THAT GIVEN MY EXPERIENCE

01:33:10.217 --> 01:33:11.819
ON THE COMMITTEE AND THE

01:33:11.886 --> 01:33:13.254
DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAD AROUND

01:33:13.321 --> 01:33:14.989

01:33:15.056 --> 01:33:17.925
CLEAR GUIDELINES TO JUDGES. ON

01:33:17.992 --> 01:33:21.495
HOW TO USE ENHANCEMENTS- YOU

01:33:21.562 --> 01:33:22.663

01:33:22.730 --> 01:33:23.831
IF IT ENCAMPMENTS ARE EVEN

01:33:23.898 --> 01:33:25.166
APPROPRIATE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT

THAT IS ONE OF THE

01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:18.926
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAME FROM-

01:38:18.993 --> 01:38:19.526
COMMITTEE ON THE REVISION OF

01:38:19.593 --> 01:38:21.762
THE PENAL CODE NOW WHAT THIS

01:38:21.829 --> 01:38:24.298
BILL RECOGNIZES IS THAT

01:38:24.365 --> 01:38:26.267
CALIFORNIA'S ROBBERY STATUTE

01:38:26.333 --> 01:38:28.102
WAS WRITTEN BELIEVE IT OR NOT

01:38:28.168 --> 01:38:30.471
IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO AND IS

01:38:30.537 --> 01:38:33.841
NOT BEEN MODIFIED SINCE NOW

01:38:33.907 --> 01:38:36.110
THERE ARE MANY ADDITIONAL.

01:38:36.176 --> 01:38:37.511
CRIMES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE

01:38:37.578 --> 01:38:38.946
BOOKS THAT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO

01:38:39.013 --> 01:38:42.283
WITH THEFT OR STOLEN ITEMS OR-

01:38:42.349 --> 01:38:43.817
BENJAMIN ARE YOU NAME IT BUT

01:38:43.884 --> 01:38:46.420
ROBBERY JUST AS A SINGULAR

01:38:46.487 --> 01:38:48.889
STATUTE HAS NOT BEEN MODIFIED.

01:38:48.956 --> 01:38:50.190
AND THE ROBBERY STATUTE THAT

01:38:50.257 --> 01:38:51.558
EXISTS ON OUR BOOKS IS

01:38:51.625 --> 01:38:53.327
IMMATERIAL TO THE VALUE OF WHAT

01:38:53.394 --> 01:38:56.030
A PERSON STOLE WHAT IS SUPPOSED

01:38:56.096 --> 01:38:57.998
TO DIFFERENTIATE IT BETWEEN

01:38:58.065 --> 01:39:01.235
THEFT IS THAT ROBBERY INVOLVES

01:39:01.302 --> 01:39:04.605
INJURY. OR USE OF WEAPONS ARE

01:39:04.672 --> 01:39:06.206
THERE ARE THESE OTHER FACTORS

01:39:06.273 --> 01:39:09.143
WHICH THEN MAKES IT A FELONY.

01:39:09.209 --> 01:39:13.213
NOW BECAUSE CURRENT LAW ARE

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:16.250
THEFT LAW THE THEFT IS HAS A

01:39:16.317 --> 01:39:19.320
VALUE ASSOCIATED SO THINGS OF

01:39:19.386 --> 01:39:21.555
TOTAL VALUE OF NINE HUNDRED AND

01:39:21.622 --> 01:39:24.024
FIFTY OR LESS. BUT WHAT HAPPENS

01:39:24.091 --> 01:39:26.360
IS THAT WE'VE HAD CIRCUMSTANCES

01:39:26.427 --> 01:39:28.162
IN MANY OF THESE WE RECEIVE

01:39:28.228 --> 01:39:33.734
TESTIMONY ABOUT. WHERE. EIGHT

01:39:33.801 --> 01:39:36.103
WHAT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED A

01:39:36.170 --> 01:39:39.340
PETTY THEFT OCCURS. BUT IN THE

01:39:39.406 --> 01:39:42.943
ACT SO FOR EXAMPLE. ON A PERSON

01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:45.079
IS A SHOPLIFTER AND IS RUNNING

01:39:45.145 --> 01:39:47.514
OUT OF THE STORE. BECAUSE THEY

01:39:47.581 --> 01:39:49.116
DON'T WANT TO BE CAUGHT IN THE

01:39:49.183 --> 01:39:51.118
BUMP INTO THE SECURITY GUARD

01:39:51.185 --> 01:39:51.885
THEY DON'T KNOCKED THE SECURITY

01:39:51.952 --> 01:39:53.987
GUARD OVER. THEY DON'T HURT THE

01:39:54.054 --> 01:39:55.989
SECURITY GUARD BUT THEY BUMP

01:39:56.056 --> 01:39:57.257
INTO THEM AS THEY RUN OUT.

01:39:57.324 --> 01:40:01.595
BECAUSE THERE IS NO REAL

01:40:01.662 --> 01:40:05.632
DEFINITION OF WHAT THE FORCE OR

01:40:05.699 --> 01:40:06.934
THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.802
SOCIALLY WITH ROBBERY. ANY

01:40:08.869 --> 01:40:11.472
PROSECUTOR WHO CHOOSES TO CAN

01:40:11.538 --> 01:40:14.041
ELEVATE THAT CHARGE TO A FELONY

01:40:14.108 --> 01:40:20.681
CHARGE. NOW. CERTAINLY ANY.

01:40:20.748 --> 01:40:23.717
THEFT THEN FALLS OR RESULTS IN

01:40:23.784 --> 01:40:25.819
AN INJURY TO A PERSON AND I

01:40:25.886 --> 01:40:27.521
WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT UNDER THE

01:40:27.588 --> 01:40:29.590
LAW GREAT BODILY INJURY CAN

01:40:29.656 --> 01:40:32.192
INCLUDES BRUISING A BLACK TIE

01:40:32.259 --> 01:40:33.861
CAN BE DEFINED UNDER OUR

01:40:33.927 --> 01:40:35.496
STATUTE IS GREAT BODILY INJURY

01:40:35.562 --> 01:40:39.500
THAT MY BILL THE THIS ONE SB

01:40:39.566 --> 01:40:41.502
TWO WOULD NOT. ALLOW THAT TEND

01:40:41.568 --> 01:40:44.705
TO BECOME. THE FACT WHAT MY

01:40:44.772 --> 01:40:48.475
BILL DOES IS CREATE A HIGHER

01:40:48.542 --> 01:40:51.145
CATEGORY OF DAFT. ABOVE JUST

01:40:51.211 --> 01:40:54.047
THE BASELINE ONE WHICH ONLY.

01:40:54.114 --> 01:40:55.916
REQUIRES NOW UP TO SIX MONTHS

01:40:55.983 --> 01:40:59.086
IN JAIL. BUT CREATING A NEW

01:40:59.153 --> 01:41:02.656
CATEGORY OF THEFT SECOND ND YOU

01:41:02.723 --> 01:41:04.391
UP IN UP TO A YEAR OF JAIL

01:41:04.458 --> 01:41:06.059
WHERE THERE WERE SOME

01:41:06.126 --> 01:41:08.328
INADVERTENT AND HOW MANY USED

01:41:08.395 --> 01:41:09.830
TO TERMS THAT ARE ALWAYS SCARY

01:41:09.897 --> 01:41:11.799
FOR PEOPLE BUT FOR SEVERE BUT

01:41:11.865 --> 01:41:14.935
DOES NOT RESULT. IN THE TYPE OF

01:41:15.002 --> 01:41:15.469
INJURIES I DESCRIBED EVEN

01:41:15.536 --> 01:41:18.472
BRUISING. AND IS NOT AN ASSAULT

01:41:18.539 --> 01:41:20.641
OR BATTERY. BUT NONE OF THOSE

01:41:20.707 --> 01:41:23.110
THINGS CAN BE FACTORS FOR MY

01:41:23.177 --> 01:41:25.512
BILL TO APPLY. BUT RATHER FOR

01:41:25.579 --> 01:41:30.184
THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT- BLURRED

01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:32.586
NOW. AND ARE NOT APPROPRIATE TO

01:41:32.653 --> 01:41:35.189
BE CHARGED IS ROBBERY WE WANT

01:41:35.255 --> 01:41:38.225
PEOPLE. WHO COMMIT VIOLENCE

01:41:38.292 --> 01:41:39.660
WHEN THEY STEAL TO BE CHARGED

01:41:39.726 --> 01:41:41.862
WITH ROBBERY ABSOLUTELY THAT IS

01:41:41.929 --> 01:41:43.630
APPROPRIATE AND WE WANT THAT

01:41:43.697 --> 01:41:45.098
BUT WHERE WE ARE FINDING IS

01:41:45.165 --> 01:41:46.867
BECAUSE AGAIN THE LACK OF

01:41:46.934 --> 01:41:48.902
CLARITY BETWEEN THE DISTINCTION

01:41:48.969 --> 01:41:49.903
THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE BEING

01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:52.773
CHARGED WITH FELONY ROBBERY.

01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:55.209
THAT JUDGES EVEN FEEL ARE

01:41:55.275 --> 01:41:56.910
SHOULD NOT IS NOT APPROPRIATE

01:41:56.977 --> 01:42:00.147
NOW TO D. A.'S THAT TESTIFIED

01:42:00.214 --> 01:42:02.850
IN THE COMMITTEE DESCRIBED

01:42:02.916 --> 01:42:04.852
THANKS FOR EXAMPLE. D. A.

01:42:04.918 --> 01:42:06.186
O'MALLEY WHO IS PRESIDENT OF

01:42:06.253 --> 01:42:08.388
THE DA'S ASSOCIATION AT THE

01:42:08.455 --> 01:42:10.757
TIME SHE STATED THAT. CERTAIN

01:42:10.824 --> 01:42:12.259
OF THESE ROBBERIES THERE WAS A

01:42:12.326 --> 01:42:13.927
FAMOUS COURT CASE CALLED ESTES

01:42:13.994 --> 01:42:16.797
ARE OFTEN LOW LEVEL CRIMES AND

01:42:16.864 --> 01:42:18.031
THEY SHOULD HAVE LESS SEVERE

01:42:18.098 --> 01:42:22.469
SANCTIONS. THEN FELONY ROBBERY.

01:42:22.536 --> 01:42:25.038
BANDAGE THAT SHE OFTEN TRIES TO

01:42:25.105 --> 01:42:26.740
PROSECUTE THEM AS SOMETHING

01:42:26.807 --> 01:42:30.711
DIFFERENT. ADDITIONALLY D. A.

01:42:30.777 --> 01:42:32.846
ROSEN TESTIFIED THAT THE

01:42:32.913 --> 01:42:34.147
COMMITTEE SHOULD LIMIT THE

01:42:34.214 --> 01:42:36.717
PROSECUTORS ABILITY TO CHARGE

01:42:36.783 --> 01:42:38.685
SUCH ROBBERIES AS FELONY

01:42:38.752 --> 01:42:41.922
OFFENSES. BUT THE ONLY WAY THAT

01:42:41.989 --> 01:42:43.423
WE CAN GIVE THAT GUIDANCE IS BY

01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:47.928
FIXING THE STATUTE AND SO. WHAT

01:42:47.995 --> 01:42:50.030
IN DOING SO WHAT I'M TRYING TO

01:42:50.097 --> 01:42:52.332
ACHIEVE BY EIGHTY TWO IS TO

01:42:52.399 --> 01:42:55.302
CREATE A NEW CATEGORY OF THEFT

01:42:55.369 --> 01:42:57.170
AND THIS IS NOT USUAL FOR ME TO

01:42:57.237 --> 01:42:58.839
BE ADVOCATING TO CREATE A NEW

01:42:58.906 --> 01:43:00.374
CRIME. AND A CRIME WITH A

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:02.042
HIGHER PENALTY BUT IT'S

01:43:02.109 --> 01:43:04.111
APPROPRIATE SO THAT WE DO NOT

01:43:04.177 --> 01:43:09.082
HAVE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE PEOPLE.

01:43:09.149 --> 01:43:09.683
HAVE COMMITTED SOMETHING THAT

01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:14.388
IS. AGAIN THIS THIS TYPE OF

01:43:14.454 --> 01:43:15.789
DISTINCTION THAT MAY OF THAT

01:43:15.856 --> 01:43:20.594
MANY OF US. RESULTED IN. A

01:43:20.661 --> 01:43:23.463
BUMPING INTO THE SECURITY GUARD

01:43:23.530 --> 01:43:27.167
OR- OUTSIDE YELLING AT SOMEONE

01:43:27.234 --> 01:43:29.903
FOR EXAMPLE. SO THERESHOULD BE

01:43:29.970 --> 01:43:32.406
A ABILITY TO CHARGE THEM WITH

01:43:32.472 --> 01:43:34.675
SOMETHING MORE THAN THE VERY

01:43:34.741 --> 01:43:36.944
LOWEST MISDEMEANOR BUT NOT

01:43:37.010 --> 01:43:38.879
SOMETHING AS HIGH AS ROBBERY

01:43:38.946 --> 01:43:40.547
WHICH COULD END UP GIVING YOU

01:43:40.614 --> 01:43:43.584
FIVE YEARS IN PRISON SO THAT'S

01:43:43.650 --> 01:43:44.217
THE DISTINCTION I'M TRYING TO

01:43:44.284 --> 01:43:49.456
CREATE- AND WITH THAT I WOULD

01:43:49.523 --> 01:43:51.158
LIKE TO TURN TO MY WITNESS IN

01:43:51.224 --> 01:43:56.663

APPLIED TODAY AND IS THAT

02:20:49.941 --> 02:20:53.411
APPROPRIATE- AND WE SEE THAT BY

02:20:53.478 --> 02:20:55.380
TIMES SOME DISTRICT ATTORNEYS

02:20:55.446 --> 02:20:58.416
ARE OVERCHARGING- YOU KNOW WHAT

02:20:58.483 --> 02:21:01.653

AND GOING AND INJURING SOMEONE

02:21:05.723 --> 02:21:07.292
AND COMMITTING A TERRIBLE CRIME

02:21:07.358 --> 02:21:08.827
AGAINST SOMEONE. AND TURNING IT

02:21:08.893 --> 02:21:10.995
FROM A MISDEMEANOR INTO A

02:21:11.062 --> 02:21:14.532
FELONY- SUIT YOU KNOW THIS AND

02:21:14.599 --> 02:21:15.733
WE ALSO HAVE TO BE CLEARING

02:21:15.800 --> 02:21:17.202
THIS COMES UP A LOT IT COMES UP

02:21:17.268 --> 02:21:21.706
IN OTHER CONTEXTS. MISDEMEANORS

02:21:21.773 --> 02:21:22.540
A REAL CRIME. MR YOU CAN GO TO

02:21:22.607 --> 02:21:24.742
COUNTY JAIL FOR A YEAR FOR A

02:21:24.809 --> 02:21:25.977
MISDEMEANOR I WOULDN'T WANT TO

02:21:26.044 --> 02:21:29.380
GO TO COUNTY JAIL FOR A YEAR.

02:21:29.447 --> 02:21:30.782
THAT'S A SERIOUS PUNISHMENT-

02:21:30.849 --> 02:21:32.984
AND IF YOU COMMIT. A CRIME

02:21:33.051 --> 02:21:33.551
WHERE YOU'RE REALLY ENTERING

02:21:33.618 --> 02:21:34.652
SOMEONE WE'RE ASSAULTING THEM

02:21:34.719 --> 02:21:35.887

STILL. EVEN WITH SB EIGHTY TWO.

02:21:38.723 --> 02:21:39.157
SO I THINK IT'S REALLY

02:21:39.224 --> 02:21:40.758
IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO FOCUS

02:21:40.825 --> 02:21:42.760
ON WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND WHAT

02:21:42.827 --> 02:21:46.464
IT DOESN'T DO- AND I UNDERSTAND

02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:51.069
SCARED ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING

02:21:51.135 --> 02:21:53.671
IN THE COMMUNITY I SHARE THAT

02:21:53.738 --> 02:21:57.108
ANGER. TURNS MY STOMACH WHEN I

02:21:57.175 --> 02:21:59.711
SEE WHAT PEOPLE ARE CAPABLE OF

02:21:59.777 --> 02:22:01.746
DOING TO OTHER PEOPLE-

02:22:01.813 --> 02:22:03.548
PARTICULARLY TO SOME OF OUR

02:22:03.615 --> 02:22:05.350
MOST VULNERABLE SENIORS IT IS

02:22:05.416 --> 02:22:09.988
DESPICABLE. AND IT NEEDS TO BE

02:22:10.054 --> 02:22:10.521
THE PEOPLE NEED TO BE HELD

02:22:10.588 --> 02:22:11.723
ACCOUNTABLE. BUT THAT'S NOT

02:22:11.789 --> 02:22:14.826
WHAT THIS BILL. IS ABOUT- AND

02:22:14.893 --> 02:22:17.161
SO I SUPPORT THIS BILL- I DON'T

02:22:17.228 --> 02:22:19.497
MOVE IT. AND I HOPE THAT PEOPLE

02:22:19.564 --> 02:22:22.166
WHO ARE AS CONCERNED AS WE ALL

02:22:22.233 --> 02:22:22.967
ARE ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING THE

02:22:23.034 --> 02:22:25.303
COMMUNITY. CAN FOCUS ON THE

02:22:25.370 --> 02:22:27.739
FACTS HERE. AND REALLY FOCUS ON

02:22:27.805 --> 02:22:29.407
HAVING ACCURATE FACTS ABOUT

02:22:29.474 --> 02:22:31.009
THIS LEGISLATION AND ANY

02:22:31.075 --> 02:22:32.744
LEGISLATION. I KNOW LIKE MY

02:22:32.810 --> 02:22:34.345
COLLEAGUES I NEVER HAVE A

02:22:34.412 --> 02:22:36.381
PROBLEM FOR BEING CRITICIZED.

02:22:36.447 --> 02:22:37.749
FOR WHAT I DO AND I'M SURE

02:22:37.815 --> 02:22:39.817
CENTER SKINNER IS OF THE SAME

02:22:39.884 --> 02:22:42.053
MIND BUT I BUT IT'S BUT IT'S

02:22:42.120 --> 02:22:44.622
NOT RIGHT. TO CRITICIZE SOMEONE

02:22:44.689 --> 02:22:46.658
FOR WHAT THEY DIDN'T DO- AND

02:22:46.724 --> 02:22:49.527
THAT IS HAPPENING HERE WITH US

02:22:49.594 --> 02:22:50.161
YOU TO SOME OF THE BILL. THANK

02:22:50.228 --> 02:22:53.064
YOU ANY DISAGREEMENTS BY

02:22:53.131 --> 02:22:57.735
COLLEAGUES HERE. IN NINETEEN

02:22:57.802 --> 02:22:59.137
NINE I JUST ALSO JUST WANNA

02:22:59.203 --> 02:23:01.372
RECALLED BACK WHICH A SENATOR

02:23:01.439 --> 02:23:05.143
WINNER JUST STATED- THIS BILL

02:23:05.209 --> 02:23:08.179
DOES NOT MINIMIZE CRIME IN ANY

02:23:08.246 --> 02:23:10.381
SHAPE FORM OR FASHION AND IN

02:23:10.448 --> 02:23:13.017
FACT IT ENHANCES THE TIME THAT

02:23:13.084 --> 02:23:15.320
ONE WOULD DO FROM SIX MONTHS TO

02:23:15.386 --> 02:23:19.490
A YEAR FOR A MISDEMEANOR THEFT.

02:23:19.557 --> 02:23:21.559
AND I THINK THAT SIGNIFICANT

02:23:21.626 --> 02:23:23.561
BUT AGAIN IT DOESN'T DO

02:23:23.628 --> 02:23:25.897
ANYTHING AND HAS BEEN DESCRIBED

02:23:25.964 --> 02:23:28.366
BY THE OPPOSITION TO MAKE ARE

02:23:28.433 --> 02:23:30.068
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WHETHER

02:23:30.134 --> 02:23:31.669
IT'S OUR API COMMUNITY ANYONE

02:23:31.736 --> 02:23:34.105
ANYMORE VULNERABLE AND LESS

02:23:34.172 --> 02:23:35.873
LIKELY FOR THE OTHER INDIVIDUAL

02:23:35.940 --> 02:23:38.142
WHO MIGHT ASSAULT SOMEONE TO BE

02:23:38.209 --> 02:23:41.646
CHARGED FOR THAT CRIME WHAT

02:23:41.713 --> 02:23:43.748
THIS DOES IS JUST. PREVENT

02:23:43.815 --> 02:23:46.784
THERE ARE UNNECESSARY. CHARGES

02:23:46.851 --> 02:23:51.489
FOR PEOPLE WHO ABUSE MINOR.

02:23:51.556 --> 02:23:53.625
FORCE IN THE COMMISSION OF THAT

02:23:53.691 --> 02:23:55.660
CRIME AND THAT'S WHAT AND THE

02:23:55.727 --> 02:23:57.095
SAYS SENATORS TRYING TO ADDRESS

02:23:57.161 --> 02:24:00.665
HERE VERSUS- AGAIN OVER

02:24:00.732 --> 02:24:02.600
SENTENCING PEOPLE- IN MANY WAYS

02:24:02.667 --> 02:24:05.303
SO ON THAT NOTE- CENTERS CAN OR

02:24:05.370 --> 02:24:07.205
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. HANK

02:24:07.271 --> 02:24:08.706
YOU MISTER CHAIR APPRECIATE

02:24:08.773 --> 02:24:10.942
THE- DISCUSSION SO FAR BY THE

02:24:11.009 --> 02:24:15.446
COMMITTEE. NO THE MY COLLEAGUE

02:24:15.513 --> 02:24:17.815
FOR SEARCHES GO REYES SUCH

02:24:17.882 --> 02:24:20.385
THINGS AS ASSAULT. I WILL

02:24:20.451 --> 02:24:22.487
ADDITIONALLY ADD BATTERY FOR

02:24:22.553 --> 02:24:24.789
EXAMPLE THIS BILL DOES NOT

02:24:24.856 --> 02:24:27.625
ELIMINATE BATTERY AND YOU CAN

02:24:27.692 --> 02:24:30.395
BE CHARGED WITH EITHER THEFT OR

02:24:30.461 --> 02:24:32.530
ROBBERY AND BATTERY YOU CAN BE

02:24:32.597 --> 02:24:34.399
CHARGED WITH A HATE CRIME ALONG

02:24:34.465 --> 02:24:36.167
WITH STAFF TO FOR EXAMPLE YOU

02:24:36.234 --> 02:24:37.668
COULD BE CHARGED WITH ELDER

02:24:37.735 --> 02:24:39.937
ABUSE YOU COULD BE CHARGED. THE

02:24:40.004 --> 02:24:42.040
THING THAT WHAT HAPPENED SO

02:24:42.106 --> 02:24:44.642
OFTEN IS WE CONFLATE THE CHANGE

02:24:44.709 --> 02:24:46.844
OF WORK IN ONE STATUTE AS

02:24:46.911 --> 02:24:48.846
AFFECTING ALL OTHER FACTORS

02:24:48.913 --> 02:24:50.715
WHEN THIS DOES NOT AFFECT ALL

02:24:50.782 --> 02:24:53.084
OTHER FACTORS NOW I USE THE

02:24:53.151 --> 02:24:54.619
EXAMPLE OF A BLACK GUY VERY

02:24:54.685 --> 02:24:58.189
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THERE IS

02:24:58.256 --> 02:24:59.757
LITERALLY A NUMBER OF. COURT

02:24:59.824 --> 02:25:02.560
CASES AND PRECEDENTS WHERE

02:25:02.627 --> 02:25:04.495
BLACK I WAS DEFINED AS GREAT

02:25:04.562 --> 02:25:06.998
BODILY INJURY. AND IF THERE IS

02:25:07.065 --> 02:25:09.033
ANY TYPE OF GREAT BODILY INJURY

02:25:09.100 --> 02:25:10.601
THEN SB EIGHTY TWO DOES NOT

02:25:10.668 --> 02:25:14.172
APPLY AT ALL TO EVEN BRUISING.

02:25:14.238 --> 02:25:16.574
IS UNDER. THE PENAL CODE AND

02:25:16.641 --> 02:25:18.042
YOU CAN LOOK IT UP UNDER THE

02:25:18.109 --> 02:25:19.510
DEFINITION OF PENAL CODE

02:25:19.577 --> 02:25:21.813
INCLUDES FOR EXAMPLE PROVING

02:25:21.879 --> 02:25:25.983
BRUISING. SO AS ARE A COLLEAGUE

02:25:26.050 --> 02:25:27.452
FROM SEARCHES GROUP DESCRIBED.

02:25:27.518 --> 02:25:28.653
THERE'S BEEN A HORRIFIC

02:25:28.719 --> 02:25:33.091
INCREASE OF CRIMES AGAINST- OUR

02:25:33.157 --> 02:25:36.694
API COMMUNITY BEYOND THERE IS

02:25:36.761 --> 02:25:38.930
FEAR NOW THAT ANY TYPE OF

02:25:38.996 --> 02:25:41.432
CHANGES IN OUR PENAL CODE MIGHT

02:25:41.499 --> 02:25:43.434
MOTIVATE UCH CRIMINALS TO

02:25:43.501 --> 02:25:46.838
CONTINUE TO PREY ON OUR API

02:25:46.904 --> 02:25:49.240
COMMUNITY WITH APPS I AM

02:25:49.307 --> 02:25:52.710
ABSOLUTELY. OPPOSED TO ANYTHING

02:25:52.777 --> 02:25:56.013
THAT WOULD INCREASE THOSE

02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:57.615
CRIMES AGAINST OUR API

02:25:57.682 --> 02:26:00.384
COMMUNITY AND I WANT SUCH

02:26:00.451 --> 02:26:02.687
CRIMES TO BE FULLY FULLY

02:26:02.753 --> 02:26:04.689
ENFORCED AND TO IF THEY HAVE A

02:26:04.755 --> 02:26:07.692
HATE. PRIME COMPONENT TO THEM

02:26:07.759 --> 02:26:09.160
TO HAVE THE ADDITION OF THE

02:26:09.227 --> 02:26:11.429
HATE CRIME ADDED. AND IF

02:26:11.496 --> 02:26:12.330
THERE'S ANY TYPE OF SERIOUS

02:26:12.396 --> 02:26:14.499
INJURY FOR- FOR EXAMPLE SOME

02:26:14.565 --> 02:26:16.134
FOLKS NOT NECESSARILY THOSE WHO

02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:18.035
CALLED IN BUT YOU SEE I THINK

02:26:18.102 --> 02:26:19.637
SOMEONE WHO DID CALL INDEED YOU

02:26:19.704 --> 02:26:25.143
SUS EXAMPLE. IF A PERSON SHOP

02:26:25.209 --> 02:26:26.711
SOMEONE AN ELDERLY PERSON FOR

02:26:26.777 --> 02:26:28.446
EXAMPLE OFF THE BENCH THEY HAVE

02:26:28.513 --> 02:26:29.547
NOT COMMITTED THE THEFT YET

02:26:29.614 --> 02:26:31.482
THEY'VE SHOPPED PERSON

02:26:31.549 --> 02:26:33.151
VIOLENTLY OFF THE BENCH. THEN

02:26:33.217 --> 02:26:35.286
THE COMMIT THE THEFT THERE ARE

02:26:35.353 --> 02:26:37.088
TWO CRIMES THERE THERE'S NOT

02:26:37.155 --> 02:26:38.856
JUST THE THEFT THERE IS THE

02:26:38.923 --> 02:26:40.958
EITHER BATTERY OR ASSAULT OF

02:26:41.025 --> 02:26:43.127
THE SHOVING THEM OFF THE BENCH.

02:26:43.194 --> 02:26:45.396
SO  WANTED TO BE VERY CLEAR

02:26:45.463 --> 02:26:47.999
THAT EIGHTY TWO IS NOT TRYING

02:26:48.065 --> 02:26:48.966
TO ADDRESS THAT TYPE OF

02:26:49.033 --> 02:26:51.035
CIRCUMSTANCE OR CREATE ANY TYPE

02:26:51.102 --> 02:26:52.970
OF LESSER CHARGE FOR THAT

02:26:53.037 --> 02:26:57.775
CIRCUMSTANCE- NOW IT IS

02:26:57.842 --> 02:26:59.277
ENTIRELY THE CASE THAT THERE

02:26:59.343 --> 02:27:02.013
MAY BE A NEED AS WE GO THROUGH

02:27:02.079 --> 02:27:03.714
THE PROCESS TO CLARIFY SOME

02:27:03.781 --> 02:27:05.816
DEFINITIONS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY

02:27:05.883 --> 02:27:07.785
IT IS CREATED SOME CONFUSION

02:27:07.852 --> 02:27:10.621
BUT I THINK THAT UNFORTUNATELY

02:27:10.688 --> 02:27:11.622
SOME OF THOSE AND ARE

02:27:11.689 --> 02:27:14.458
PROSECUTED PROSECUTOR COMMUNITY

02:27:14.525 --> 02:27:17.061
HAVE USED THIS BECAUSE THEY

02:27:17.128 --> 02:27:19.230
OPPOSE THIS BILL. THEY HAVE

02:27:19.297 --> 02:27:21.499
INFLAMED SOME LEGITIMATE FEARS

02:27:21.566 --> 02:27:23.868
ON PEOPLE'S PARTS NONE OF US

02:27:23.935 --> 02:27:25.169
WANT TO BE A VICTIM OF CRIME I

02:27:25.236 --> 02:27:27.038
DON'T CARE WHAT THE CRIME IS I

02:27:27.104 --> 02:27:29.307
DON'T CARE WHAT ANY LEVEL I DO

02:27:29.373 --> 02:27:31.075
NOT NOR DOES ANYONE ELSE WANT

02:27:31.142 --> 02:27:33.177
TO BE A VICTIM OF CRIME. NOR DO

02:27:33.244 --> 02:27:35.546
I EVER FEEL GOOD ABOUT ANY TYPE

02:27:35.613 --> 02:27:40.751
OF CRIME DOESN'T EVEN MATTER IF

02:27:40.818 --> 02:27:44.655
THERE IS STILL APPROPRIATE.

02:27:44.722 --> 02:27:46.791
SENTENCES FOR APPROPRIATE

02:27:46.857 --> 02:27:49.927
CRIMES AND THAT IS WHAT I AM

02:27:49.994 --> 02:27:52.230
TRYING TO DO IN SB EIGHTY TWO

02:27:52.296 --> 02:27:54.098
AND I DON'T THINK IT IS

02:27:54.165 --> 02:27:56.500
APPROPRIATE TO PREY UPON

02:27:56.567 --> 02:27:58.636
PEOPLE'S LEGITIMATE EMOTIONS

02:27:58.703 --> 02:28:02.273
ABOUT CRIME IN THIS PARTICULAR

02:28:02.340 --> 02:28:02.840
CASE WHICH I THINK HAS BEEN

02:28:02.907 --> 02:28:07.612
DONE- I DID TAKE A NIGHT

02:28:07.678 --> 02:28:09.513
APOLOGIES CHAIR THAT I DID NOT

02:28:09.580 --> 02:28:11.649
OPEN THAT I AM TAKING AN

02:28:11.716 --> 02:28:14.018
AMENDMENT THAT EXCLUDES

02:28:14.085 --> 02:28:15.953
ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME THAT

02:28:16.020 --> 02:28:17.755
WASN'T BRACED SO MUCH IN THIS

02:28:17.822 --> 02:28:20.057
CALL BUT ONE OF THE CONCERNS

02:28:20.124 --> 02:28:22.126
FOR EXAMPLE IS THAT WE HAVE HAD

02:28:22.193 --> 02:28:24.462
AND WE DO HAVE NOW A SITUATION

02:28:24.528 --> 02:28:27.732
WHERE. PEOPLE DELIBERATELY

02:28:27.798 --> 02:28:31.235
STEAL FROM SAY THE SAME STORE

02:28:31.302 --> 02:28:34.005
AGAIN REPEATEDLY AND KEEP THEIR

02:28:34.071 --> 02:28:35.640
STEALING UNDER A CERTAIN DOLLAR

02:28:35.706 --> 02:28:39.744
AMOUNT. ON AND JUST TO AVOID

02:28:39.810 --> 02:28:43.581
HIGHER CHARGES. AND WE HAVE NOW

02:28:43.648 --> 02:28:46.250
A NEW STATUTE. COVERING

02:28:46.317 --> 02:28:49.253
ORGANIZED RETAIL. THEFT OR

02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:51.922
ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME AND SO I

02:28:51.989 --> 02:28:53.791
AM MAKING SURE THAT THIS BILL

02:28:53.858 --> 02:28:56.327
DOES NOT TOUCH OR INTERFERE

02:28:56.394 --> 02:28:58.329
WITH THAT STATUTE AND SO I'VE

02:28:58.396 --> 02:29:00.231
TAKEN THAT AMENDMENT. AND WITH

02:29:00.298 --> 02:29:02.533
THAT I WOULD HOPE THAT THE

02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:05.036
COMMITTEE APPRECIATES THAT THIS

02:29:05.102 --> 02:29:07.805
BILL DOES NOT DO THE THINGS

02:29:07.872 --> 02:29:10.574
THAT WERE ASSERTED AND I HOPE

02:29:10.641 --> 02:29:13.177
THAT I. CAN GET TO RIDE VOTE.

TOOK THE TIME AND I'D LIKE TO

03:12:46.054 --> 03:12:47.555
SAY ON BEHALF OF BOTH SIDES OF

03:12:47.622 --> 03:12:49.124
THIS ISSUE IT IS A DIFFICULT

03:12:49.190 --> 03:12:50.859
ONE. I AM VERY VERY SUPPORTIVE

03:12:50.926 --> 03:12:52.294
AS YOU ALL KNOW OF THE

03:12:52.360 --> 03:12:54.462
REHABILITATION OF FOR FOLKS

03:12:54.529 --> 03:12:55.864
THAT HAVE SPENT TIME

03:12:55.931 --> 03:12:59.234
INCARCERATED VARIETY OF REASONS

03:12:59.301 --> 03:13:00.135
IN A PARTICULAR THIS ISSUE

03:13:00.201 --> 03:13:03.305
AREA- THAT PEOPLE HAVE PROBLEMS

03:13:03.371 --> 03:13:06.274
AND HIS IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT

03:13:06.341 --> 03:13:07.976
ONE I PERSONALLY HAVE BEEN A

03:13:08.043 --> 03:13:09.744
VICTIM OF SOMETHING QUITE

03:13:09.811 --> 03:13:11.413
SIMILAR TO THIS AS A CHILD AND

03:13:11.479 --> 03:13:13.548
I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT. THE

03:13:13.615 --> 03:13:14.382
MEMORIES OF THAT LAST A

03:13:14.449 --> 03:13:17.285
LIFETIME AND SO- THAT'S WHY I

03:13:17.352 --> 03:13:18.486
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

03:13:18.553 --> 03:13:20.622
THERE'S CLOSURE FOR THE VICTIMS

03:13:20.689 --> 03:13:22.524
AND PERHAPS WE NEED TO DO A

03:13:22.590 --> 03:13:23.224
LITTLE MORE WORK ON HOW WE

03:13:23.291 --> 03:13:25.060
MIGHT ACHIEVE THAT BUT AT THE

03:13:25.126 --> 03:13:27.429
SAME TIME ALFA BROUGHT UP AND

03:13:27.495 --> 03:13:29.230
THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE BILL THAT

03:13:29.297 --> 03:13:30.765
WE DO HAVE TO PROTECT TO THE

03:13:30.832 --> 03:13:31.866
ASSAILANT WE HAVE TO ENSURE

03:13:31.933 --> 03:13:33.835
THAT. THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY

03:13:33.902 --> 03:13:35.870
FOR REHABILITATION AND ONLY THE

03:13:35.937 --> 03:13:38.206
OXFORDS CAN DECIDE I BELIEVE ON

03:13:38.273 --> 03:13:40.175
WHETHER THAT ACTUALLY OCCURS AT

03:13:40.241 --> 03:13:41.943
THE TIME THEY'VE SPENT THEIR

03:13:42.010 --> 03:13:44.379
THEIR TIME IN A STATE HOSPITAL.

03:13:44.446 --> 03:13:45.814
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WHAT THE

03:13:45.880 --> 03:13:47.382
STATISTICS ARE BUT WE DO HAVE

03:13:47.449 --> 03:13:49.317
THAT WHAT IS IT THE 8% EVERY

03:13:49.384 --> 03:13:51.119
RECIDIVISM NO MATTER WHAT IS

03:13:51.186 --> 03:13:52.854
DONE THIS WAS A COUPLE YEARS

03:13:52.921 --> 03:13:54.622
AGO ONLY STILL HAVE STATISTICS

03:13:54.689 --> 03:13:56.825
THAT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING OUT

03:13:56.891 --> 03:13:58.159
TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE

03:13:58.226 --> 03:14:00.061
TREATMENT CHEN IN THE APPROACH

03:14:00.128 --> 03:14:01.763
TO SOMETHING AS SERIOUS AS

03:14:01.830 --> 03:14:03.965
THEIR FATHER ARE ACTUALLY WE'RE

03:14:04.032 --> 03:14:05.533
GETTING GOOD RESULTS BUT IN THE

03:14:05.600 --> 03:14:07.635
MEANTIME. IT IS IMPORTANT AS I

03:14:09.938 --> 03:14:11.906
VICTIMS AND CERTAINLY AT THE

03:14:11.973 --> 03:14:13.508
PREDATORS AND HOPE THAT WE

03:14:13.575 --> 03:14:15.643
CANNOT CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR SO

03:14:15.710 --> 03:14:17.278
THAT ARE VICTIMS WHO SPOKEN

03:14:17.345 --> 03:14:19.681

03:20:05.493 --> 03:20:07.028
AS THE EVIDENCE MAKES CLEAR

03:20:07.095 --> 03:20:08.529
MORE GUNS MEANS MORE GUN

03:20:08.596 --> 03:20:10.331
VIOLENCE. COUNTRIES THAT HAVE

03:20:10.398 --> 03:20:11.432

STORY FOR STATES THAT HAVE MORE

03:20:16.571 --> 03:20:18.840
GUNS. MORE GUNS ALSO LEAD TO

03:20:18.906 --> 03:20:20.441
MORE CRIMES AS NUMEROUS

03:20:20.508 --> 03:20:23.277
INCORRECTLY- INTERCOURSE.

03:57:32.571 --> 03:57:34.039
CONSTITUENTS AS FAR AS

03:57:34.106 --> 03:57:35.808
LISTENING AND HEEDING TO WHAT

03:57:35.874 --> 03:57:37.343
THEIR CONSTITUENTS WANT IN

03:57:37.409 --> 03:57:39.478
ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SHOW IN

03:57:39.545 --> 03:57:41.547
THEIR IN THEIR COUNTY FAIRS.

03:57:41.614 --> 03:57:44.216
I'M A QUESTION. FIVE YES- AND

03:57:44.283 --> 03:57:45.651
SO TO ANSWER YOUR FIRST POINT I

03:57:45.718 --> 03:57:46.919
ALSO APPRECIATE THE CONCEPT OF

03:57:46.986 --> 03:57:48.754
LOCAL CONTROL I THINK THERE'S

03:57:48.821 --> 03:57:49.955
ALWAYS A BALANCE OF COURSE AND

03:57:50.022 --> 03:57:51.156
I THINK YOU QUESTION FIRST OF

03:57:51.223 --> 03:57:54.526
ALL SENATOR- I THINK THERE'S A

03:57:54.593 --> 03:57:55.160
BALANCE OF COURSE BETWEEN

03:57:55.227 --> 03:57:58.163
STATEWIDE. POLICY PRIORITIES

03:57:58.230 --> 03:57:59.765
AND THIS IS ONE WHERE I THINK

03:57:59.832 --> 03:58:01.567
IT THE DATA IS CLEAR WE HAVE A

03:58:01.634 --> 03:58:03.202
GUN VIOLENCE EPIDEMIC IN THE

03:58:03.268 --> 03:58:06.205
STATE IN IN THIS COUNTRY. AND I

03:58:06.271 --> 03:58:07.773
GUESS THE ANALOGY I WOULD USE

03:58:07.840 --> 03:58:09.375
WOULD BE TO SEAT BELTS AND CAR

03:58:09.441 --> 03:58:11.910
SAFETY AND AIR BAGS BACK IN THE

03:58:11.977 --> 03:58:13.779
SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES- THE

03:58:13.846 --> 03:58:15.047
AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS DIDN'T

03:58:15.114 --> 03:58:16.315
WANT TO DO IT PEOPLE DIDN'T

03:58:16.382 --> 03:58:17.416
WANT TO HAVE MANDATORY SEATBELT

03:58:17.483 --> 03:58:19.418
LAWS- THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT

03:58:19.485 --> 03:58:20.853
WAS- MUCH LIKE WHAT WE'RE

03:58:20.919 --> 03:58:23.589
DISCUSSING TODAY- YOU KNOW. PUT

03:58:23.656 --> 03:58:25.491
DOWN ON LOCAL CONTROL SO TO

03:58:25.557 --> 03:58:28.127
SPEAK BUT IT SAVES LIVES- AND

03:58:28.193 --> 03:58:31.997
THERE WAS A- OBSTINANCE AND- A

03:58:32.064 --> 03:58:34.366
REAL. PUSH BACK AGAINST THESE

03:58:34.433 --> 03:58:36.468
TYPES OF REGULATIONS- WHAT I'M

03:58:36.535 --> 03:58:37.636
PROPOSING I DON'T THINK IS

03:58:37.703 --> 03:58:38.470
TOTALLY UNREASONABLE

03:58:38.537 --> 03:58:40.439
PARTICULARLY GIVEN THAT AS I

03:58:40.506 --> 03:58:41.940
UNDERSTAND I'VE BEEN TOLD BY MY

03:58:42.007 --> 03:58:43.342
LOCAL FAIR BOARD. THAT THEY

03:58:43.409 --> 03:58:44.743
DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY ARE

03:58:44.810 --> 03:58:45.477
SUPPOSED TO RESPOND T

03:58:45.544 --> 03:58:47.146
CONSTITUENCIES THEY'RE SUPPOSED

03:58:47.212 --> 03:58:48.013
TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE SOLVING

03:58:48.080 --> 03:58:49.748
QUOTE UNQUOTE RIGHT AND I HAD

03:58:49.815 --> 03:58:51.250
TO DRESS THAT POINT WE'RE NOT

03:58:51.316 --> 03:58:52.785
TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF MONEY

03:58:52.851 --> 03:58:54.353
FOR FAIRGROUND SO MY FAIRGROUND

03:58:54.420 --> 03:58:56.689
SAID THEY NEEDED THE MONEY- WE

03:58:56.755 --> 03:58:57.423
LOOKED INTO WHAT THEY WERE

03:58:57.489 --> 03:58:59.425
ACTUALLY MAKING IT WAS POINT

03:58:59.491 --> 03:59:00.759
TWO THREE PERCENT. OF THEIR

03:59:00.826 --> 03:59:03.529
ANNUAL REVENUES- BUT OF COURSE

03:59:03.595 --> 03:59:04.430
IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR

03:59:04.496 --> 03:59:05.698
OBLIGATION I THINK MANY FAIR

03:59:05.764 --> 03:59:07.266
BOARD MEMBERS TO FEEL THIS WAY.

03:59:07.332 --> 03:59:08.934
IS TO MAXIMIZE YOUR REVENUE

03:59:09.001 --> 03:59:10.636
INTAKE THEN YOU'RE GONNA TAKE

03:59:10.703 --> 03:59:12.037
WHATEVER YOU CAN NOW THE ONE OF

03:59:12.104 --> 03:59:13.572
THE CHALLENGES I HAVE IT WITH

03:59:13.639 --> 03:59:15.874
THIS REASONING FOR- DILEMMAS I

03:59:15.941 --> 03:59:17.409
HAVE WITH IT IS. YOU KNOW THEY

03:59:17.476 --> 03:59:19.011
ALSO DON'T TAKE PORN

03:59:19.078 --> 03:59:20.579
CONVENTIONS OR MARIJUANA

03:59:20.646 --> 03:59:22.915
CONVENTIONS WE ASK THEM I DON'T

03:59:22.981 --> 03:59:23.582
DO THAT BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE A

03:59:23.649 --> 03:59:24.817
LOT OF MONEY TO THEY SAY IT'S

03:59:24.883 --> 03:59:25.851
BECAUSE THOSE ARE NOT FAMILY

03:59:25.918 --> 03:59:27.252
FRIENDLY AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO.

03:59:27.319 --> 03:59:29.655
BE A FAMILY FRIENDLY VENUE WHY

03:59:29.722 --> 03:59:31.423
I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU ALL THAT.

03:59:31.490 --> 03:59:33.959
GUN VIOLENCE IS MUCH MORE

03:59:34.026 --> 03:59:36.061
FAMILY PROBLEMATIC AND ON

03:59:36.128 --> 03:59:37.996
FAMILY FRIENDLY THEN PORN OR

03:59:38.063 --> 03:59:45.270
CANNABIS AND THAT'S. NOT THE

03:59:45.337 --> 03:59:45.904
CITY TO BE INDOORS ONE OF THOSE

03:59:45.971 --> 03:59:46.872
TWO BUT OTHER TO SAY. BECAUSE

03:59:46.939 --> 03:59:47.639
AT THE END. MECHANISMS I JUST

03:59:47.706 --> 03:59:48.540
THINK THERE'S SOME WRONG. I'LL

03:59:48.607 --> 03:59:49.641
SAY THAT MIGHT VERY OWN THIS IS

03:59:49.708 --> 03:59:50.609
TRANSCEND. SO FRANCISCO. ACROSS

03:59:50.676 --> 03:59:52.611
THIS. ARE NOT RESPONDING TO

03:59:52.678 --> 03:59:54.780
WHAT I THINK SHE IS SEE. AN

03:59:54.847 --> 03:59:56.281
OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT IN MY

03:59:56.348 --> 03:59:58.350
DISTRICT IN ORANGE COUNTY FOR.

03:59:58.417 --> 03:59:59.384
YOU KNOW GETTING GUNS OFF THE

03:59:59.451 --> 04:00:00.619
STREET AND NONE OF THIS BY THE

04:00:00.686 --> 04:00:02.121
WAY TAKES GUNS AWAY AWAY FROM

04:00:02.187 --> 04:00:03.422
GUN STORES DOESN'T IN HIM

04:00:03.489 --> 04:00:05.124
FRENCH UPON PEOPLE'S RIGHTS TO

04:00:05.190 --> 04:00:07.025
LAWFULLY PURCHASING ON A GUN.

04:00:07.092 --> 04:00:07.793
ALL IT SAYS IS THAT WE DON'T

04:00:07.860 --> 04:00:09.728
WANT TAXPAYER VENUES TO BE USED

04:00:09.795 --> 04:00:10.896
FOR THOSE PURPOSES. SO I DON'T

04:00:10.963 --> 04:00:12.731
THINK THIS REALLY INFRINGES ON

04:00:12.798 --> 04:00:14.566
PRINCIPLES- THAT YOU'RE

04:00:14.633 --> 04:00:15.567
IMPLICATING BUT BUT I

04:00:15.634 --> 04:00:16.568
UNDERSTAND THERE IS A

04:00:16.635 --> 04:00:18.570
DIFFERENCE. IN HOW WE VIEW GUNS

04:00:18.637 --> 04:00:20.439
AND I WOULD SUBMIT THAT. THIS

04:00:20.506 --> 04:00:22.241
IS AN ATTEMPT TO KIND OF. THE

04:00:22.307 --> 04:00:23.242
SORT OF BRIDGE THE DIFFERENCE A

04:00:23.308 --> 04:00:24.409
LITTLE BIT IT'S NOT FORCING

04:00:24.476 --> 04:00:25.677
ANYTHING IT'S SIMPLY SAYING

04:00:25.744 --> 04:00:27.279
THAT. STATE OWNED PROPERTY

04:00:27.346 --> 04:00:31.150
SHOULD NOT BE A CONDUIT. FOR

04:00:31.216 --> 04:00:31.717
DISTRIBUTING MORE GUNS INTO

04:00:31.784 --> 04:00:33.185
COMMUNITIES. SO TO THAT I WOULD

04:00:33.252 --> 04:00:35.020
FOLLOW UP WITH ANOTHER QUESTION

04:00:35.087 --> 04:00:37.222
ASKED TO. IF THESE WE

04:00:37.289 --> 04:00:39.224
UNDERSTAND THAT THE- GUN

04:00:39.291 --> 04:00:42.261
INDUSTRY IS VERY MUCH REGULATED

04:00:42.327 --> 04:00:45.063
HIGHLY REGULATED IN CALIFORNIA-

04:00:45.130 --> 04:00:47.132
THESE ARE IT LEGALLY OWNED AND

04:00:47.199 --> 04:00:49.902
LEGALLY. LEGALLY A BITING. OUT

04:00:49.968 --> 04:00:51.603
BUSINESSES FUNCTIONING IN THESE

04:00:51.670 --> 04:00:54.907
ENDEAVORS. WHAT IN YOUR BEING

04:00:54.973 --> 04:00:55.707
SENT TO YOUR ATTORNEY SAM I

04:00:55.774 --> 04:00:57.609
RESPECT I RESPECT YOUR BUT YOUR

04:00:57.676 --> 04:00:59.478
YOUR OPINION ON THIS BUT WHAT

04:00:59.545 --> 04:01:02.347
TO- WHAT GROUNDS COULD WE HAVE

04:01:02.414 --> 04:01:05.851
IS A STATE TO MANDATE NOT BE

04:01:05.918 --> 04:01:06.451
ABLE TO HAVE THESE BUSINESSES.

04:01:06.518 --> 04:01:10.355
OUT FUNCTION OR DO BUSINESS ON

04:01:10.422 --> 04:01:13.959
ON ON THE PUBLIC- PUBLIC LANDS

04:01:14.026 --> 04:01:16.061
OR PUBLIC VENUES. BECAUSE THE

04:01:16.128 --> 04:01:17.396
STATE PROPERTY I DON'T THINK

04:01:17.462 --> 04:01:18.897
THE COMMITTEES EVER RAISED AN

04:01:18.964 --> 04:01:21.033
ISSUE AND I KNOW THAT- THE HEAD

04:01:21.099 --> 04:01:23.869
OF- THE- LIAISON- MISTER

04:01:23.936 --> 04:01:25.971
GRIFFIN FROM CPC RPA REYES

04:01:26.038 --> 04:01:27.773
STATE CONSTITUTIONALITY ISSUE.

04:01:27.840 --> 04:01:28.707
I DON'T THINK THAT'S WELL

04:01:28.774 --> 04:01:30.275
FOUNDED NIGHT THAT THE C. R.

04:01:30.342 --> 04:01:32.878
P.'S LAWSUITS. AGAINST SAN

04:01:32.945 --> 04:01:33.879
DIEGO AND HAVE NOT GONE

04:01:33.946 --> 04:01:35.981
ANYWHERE BOB THIS IS EVEN MORE

04:01:36.048 --> 04:01:38.016
WELL GROUNDED BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

04:01:38.083 --> 04:01:38.650
TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE DISCONNECT

04:01:38.717 --> 04:01:40.786
YOUR TALKING ABOUT. THE STATE

04:01:40.853 --> 04:01:42.187
SAYING THAT WE DON'T WANT

04:01:42.254 --> 04:01:42.921
CERTAIN ACTIVITIES DONE ON

04:01:42.988 --> 04:01:44.389
STATE PROPERTY IT'S OUR

04:01:44.456 --> 04:01:46.725
PROPERTY. AND AS MUCH AS I DO

04:01:46.792 --> 04:01:48.327
RESPECT THE SECOND AMENDMENT I

04:01:48.393 --> 04:01:49.194
WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT THE

04:01:49.261 --> 04:01:51.163
TENTH AMENDMENT. GIVES THE

04:01:51.230 --> 04:01:51.797
STATE'S INCLUDING THE STATE OF

04:01:51.864 --> 04:01:53.665
CALIFORNIA SIGNIFICANTLY WAY TO

04:01:53.732 --> 04:01:55.200
MANAGE OUR OWN AFFAIRS NOW WE

04:01:55.267 --> 04:01:57.836
CANNOT TELL GUNNED IT STORES

04:01:57.903 --> 04:01:59.104
YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T SELL GUNS WE

04:01:59.171 --> 04:02:00.873
CAN'T WE CAN'T WE CAN'T TELL

04:02:00.939 --> 04:02:01.907
GUN OWNERS YOU CAN'T OWN GUNS

04:02:01.974 --> 04:02:03.342
THE SECOND AMENDMENT. AS

04:02:03.408 --> 04:02:04.776
INTERPRETED BY THE SUPREME

04:02:04.843 --> 04:02:05.844
COURT UNITED STATES HAS MADE

04:02:05.911 --> 04:02:07.946
THAT CLEAR. BUT NEITHER CAN THE

04:02:08.013 --> 04:02:08.947
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR ANYONE

04:02:09.014 --> 04:02:09.948
ELSE TELL THE STATE OF

04:02:10.015 --> 04:02:14.253
CALIFORNIA. WHAT WE CAN OR

04:02:14.319 --> 04:02:15.420
CANNOT DO WITH OUR PROPERTY.

04:02:15.487 --> 04:02:24.129
OKAY. AND JUST SO HIS WORDS

04:02:24.196 --> 04:02:26.098
WERE CLEAR THESE ARE LEGAL

04:02:26.164 --> 04:02:28.734
ACTIVITIES- THAT ARE GOING ON

04:02:28.800 --> 04:02:31.503
WITH- AND PERSON BECAUSE I KNOW

04:02:31.570 --> 04:02:33.772
MANY OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS AND-

04:02:33.839 --> 04:02:36.074
AND INDIVIDUALS THAT ATTEND

04:02:36.141 --> 04:02:39.378
THESE EVENTS- WITH HEALTHY MIND

04:02:39.444 --> 04:02:41.546
SAID SPEAR REALLY WHILE DOING

04:02:41.613 --> 04:02:43.282
IT A CULTURAL FAMILY THING

04:02:43.348 --> 04:02:45.083
ATTENDING THESE THEY FOLLOW THE

04:02:45.150 --> 04:02:46.518
LAWS THEY DO EVERYTHING THAT

04:02:46.585 --> 04:02:48.287
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING IT

04:02:48.353 --> 04:02:49.821
AND AS THE GENTLEMAN THE

04:02:49.888 --> 04:02:51.924
WITNESS. STATED EARLIER THERE

04:02:51.990 --> 04:02:53.592
ARE NO GUNS THAT ARE ACTUALLY

04:02:53.659 --> 04:02:55.027
BEING TRANSMITTED OR BEING SOLD

04:02:55.093 --> 04:02:56.261
RIGHT AT THAT TIME THEY STILL

04:02:56.328 --> 04:02:57.796
HAVE TO GO TO THE TEN DAY

04:02:57.863 --> 04:02:59.331
PROCESS RIGHT ALTHOUGH IT'S HAS

04:02:59.398 --> 04:03:01.233
BEEN DESCRIBED BY NUMEROUS

04:03:01.300 --> 04:03:02.301
PEOPLE AND I'M NOT REALLY AND

04:03:02.367 --> 04:03:03.602
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT MR

04:03:03.669 --> 04:03:05.437
LINDLEY WAS NOT ABLE TO TESTIFY

04:03:05.504 --> 04:03:06.038
BECAUSE HE WAS GOING TO SPEAK

04:03:06.104 --> 04:03:08.173
AT THIS POINT- BUT WHAT HE'S

04:03:08.240 --> 04:03:09.641
GOING TO DESCRIBE WAS A CIRCUS

04:03:09.708 --> 04:03:11.209
OR A CARNIVAL LIKE ATMOSPHERE

04:03:11.276 --> 04:03:12.711
AND SO THERE ARE LOTS OF GUN

04:03:12.778 --> 04:03:14.546
SALES THAT HAPPENED JUST IN THE

04:03:14.613 --> 04:03:16.682
PARKING LOT FOR A HAPPEN

04:03:16.748 --> 04:03:17.883
THROUGH VAN KNOW WHERE THE GUN

04:03:17.950 --> 04:03:20.218
IS DELIVERED LATER AND SO- WHAT

04:03:20.285 --> 04:03:21.820
HE'S GOING TO TESTIFY TO IS

04:03:21.887 --> 04:03:22.554
THAT HE HAD PERSONALLY

04:03:22.621 --> 04:03:24.890
WITNESSED. A NUMBER OF DEALERS

04:03:24.957 --> 04:03:26.458
BEING WILLING TO ENGAGE IN SO

04:03:26.525 --> 04:03:28.727
CALLED STRAW SALES WHICH IS I'M

04:03:28.794 --> 04:03:29.828
GOING UP THERE IN PURCHASING ON

04:03:29.895 --> 04:03:31.463
BEHALF OF SOMEONE ELSE IS VERY

04:03:31.530 --> 04:03:32.431
CLEAR ON PURCHASING FOR SOMEONE

04:03:32.497 --> 04:03:34.533
ELSE A NUMBER OF GUN DEALERS

04:03:34.599 --> 04:03:35.767
APPEARED WILLING TO ENGAGE IN

04:03:35.834 --> 04:03:37.202
THOSE TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS

04:03:37.269 --> 04:03:39.004
OTHER TYPES OF UNLICENSED SALES

04:03:39.071 --> 04:03:40.939
APPEAR TO BE OCCURRING AS WELL

04:03:41.006 --> 04:03:42.207
SO I WOULD TAKE DISPUTE WITH

04:03:42.274 --> 04:03:44.443
THAT- CLAIM THAT YOU KNOW FIRST

04:03:44.509 --> 04:03:45.877
OF ALL IT'S KIND OF TOUGH TO

04:03:45.944 --> 04:03:47.312
SAY THERE'S A 100% OF ANYTHING

04:03:47.379 --> 04:03:49.147
RIGHT. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

04:03:49.214 --> 04:03:50.248
PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS FOLLOW THE

04:03:50.315 --> 04:03:52.017
LAW- BUT JUST GIVEN THE

04:03:52.084 --> 04:03:54.753
ATMOSPHERE- IT'S BEEN I THINK

04:03:54.820 --> 04:03:56.555
WELL DOCUMENTED THAT THAT THERE

04:03:56.621 --> 04:04:00.292
ARE A LOT OF- UNSEEMLY ILLICIT

04:04:00.359 --> 04:04:02.361
PURCHASES AND SALES THE CURRENT

04:04:02.427 --> 04:04:04.596
THESE GUN SHOWS EVEN IF THAT WE

04:04:04.663 --> 04:04:06.064
REGULATE AWAY AND SO THIS IS

04:04:06.131 --> 04:04:07.566
KIND OF A HOT BED OF STUFF LIKE

04:04:07.632 --> 04:04:08.767
THAT ACCORDING TO A NUMBER OF

04:04:08.834 --> 04:04:11.136
STUDIES AND TESTIMONIES OF

04:04:11.203 --> 04:04:17.109
FOLKS LIKE MISTER LINDLEY. DO

04:04:17.175 --> 04:04:17.943
WE HAVE ANY DATA THAT. HAS A-

04:04:18.010 --> 04:04:20.278
BETWEEN- IN GUNS OR- WHATEVER

04:04:20.345 --> 04:04:22.814
YOU CAN PURCHASE- RIFLES OR SO

04:04:22.881 --> 04:04:24.282
FORTH IT. DON'T KNOW ALL THE

04:04:24.349 --> 04:04:27.552
AT. ALL THE DIFFERENT YPES OF.

04:04:27.619 --> 04:04:30.288
GUNS PER SE BUT- DO WE HAVE ANY

04:04:30.355 --> 04:04:30.789
DATA THAT STIPULATE OR

04:04:30.856 --> 04:04:33.225
CORRELATE- HOW MANY OF THOSE

04:04:33.291 --> 04:04:35.560
THAT ARE BOUGHT AT GUN SHOWS

04:04:35.627 --> 04:04:37.162
ARE ATTRIBUTED TO CRIMES. IT IS

04:04:37.229 --> 04:04:39.064
TOUGH TO TRACK THEM WHAT WHAT

04:04:39.131 --> 04:04:41.566
HAS BEEN STATED IS THAT- I

04:04:41.633 --> 04:04:43.101
THINK IT WAS LET ME SEE HERE IT

04:04:43.168 --> 04:04:45.804
WOULD MIGHT BEEN THE- FBI OR

04:04:45.871 --> 04:04:49.107
ATF HAS SAID- THAT GUN SHOWS OR

04:04:49.174 --> 04:04:50.275
THE CRITICAL MOMENT IN THE

04:04:50.342 --> 04:04:51.910
CHAIN OF CUSTODY FOR MANY GUNS

04:04:51.977 --> 04:04:53.045
THE POINT AT WHICH THEY MOVE

04:04:53.111 --> 04:04:54.446
FROM THE SOMEWHAT REGULATED

04:04:54.513 --> 04:04:56.448
LEGAL MARKET. THE SHADOW WE NO

04:04:56.515 --> 04:04:58.950
QUESTIONS ASKED THE LEGAL

04:04:59.017 --> 04:05:03.055
MARKET- LET'S SEE HERE. 80% OF

04:05:03.121 --> 04:05:04.723
FIRE ARMS AND SEIZED BY MEXICAN

04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:06.291
AUTHORITIES IN LAST FIVE YEARS

04:05:06.358 --> 04:05:08.160
HAVE COME TO THE UNITED STATES.

04:05:08.226 --> 04:05:09.761
AND IT IS BELIEVED I GET IT

04:05:09.828 --> 04:05:10.862
THIS IS A IT'S HARD TO FIND

04:05:10.929 --> 04:05:12.130
DATA BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING

04:05:12.197 --> 04:05:14.166
ABOUT A BY DEFINITION.

04:05:14.232 --> 04:05:15.500
SOMETHING THAT'S ILLEGAL RIGHT

04:05:15.567 --> 04:05:16.735
SO WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY

04:05:16.802 --> 04:05:19.271
ORIGINATE FROM BUT THERE IS A

04:05:19.337 --> 04:05:20.772
THERE'S CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT

04:05:20.839 --> 04:05:23.809
THERE ARE. PURCHASES AND SALES

04:05:23.875 --> 04:05:25.544
OF THESE TYPES OF GUNS AND THEN

04:05:25.610 --> 04:05:27.012
THE QUESTION IS HOW MANY MOVES

04:05:27.079 --> 04:05:29.714
INTO THAT. STREAM OF ILLICIT

04:05:29.781 --> 04:05:31.450
GUNS AND- YOU KNOW JUST TO BE

04:05:31.516 --> 04:05:32.584
PERFECTLY HONEST I DON'T THINK

04:05:32.651 --> 04:05:33.819
ANYONE HAS THAT DATE I'M NOT

04:05:33.885 --> 04:05:35.554
SURE IF IT'S REALLY SOMETHING

04:05:35.620 --> 04:05:36.388
YOU'RE ABLE TO GOING TO BE ABLE

04:05:36.455 --> 04:05:40.125
TO QUALIFY- BUT IT DOES. PEOPLE

04:05:40.192 --> 04:05:40.725
HAVE BEEN CONCERNED THAT THIS

04:05:40.792 --> 04:05:41.960
DOES HAPPEN. OKAY AND IT'S MY

04:05:42.027 --> 04:05:43.695
UNDERSTANDING AND CORRECT ME IF

04:05:43.762 --> 04:05:44.296
I'M WRONG BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW

04:05:44.362 --> 04:05:48.633
BUT- DID THEY HAVE UNDER COVER-

04:05:48.700 --> 04:05:50.702
OFFICERS ON THE GROUNDS WHEN

04:05:50.769 --> 04:05:53.338
THEY'RE THEY'RE SELLING- GUNS

04:05:53.405 --> 04:05:54.840
AT THE GUN SHOWS. I'M SURE THEY

04:05:54.906 --> 04:05:56.675
DO OF UNDERCOVER OFFICERS THEY

04:05:56.741 --> 04:05:57.142
CERTAINLY OF UNIFORMED

04:05:57.209 --> 04:05:59.544
OFFICERS. AND- BUT YOU KNOW

04:05:59.611 --> 04:06:02.047
AGAIN. IT'S JUST KIND OF THE

04:06:02.114 --> 04:06:03.081
NATURE OF THE TRANSACTION RIGHT

04:06:03.148 --> 04:06:05.083
AND SO- FOR EXAMPLE AGAIN THERE

04:06:05.150 --> 04:06:06.418
HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS PEOPLE THAT

04:06:06.485 --> 04:06:08.220
HAVE GONE TO GUN SHOWS AND IT

04:06:08.286 --> 04:06:09.988
TRIED TO ENGAGE IN ILLEGAL.

04:06:10.055 --> 04:06:12.357
TRANSACTIONS AND THEY HAD

04:06:12.424 --> 04:06:13.992
DOCUMENTED THAT IN FACT THERE

04:06:14.059 --> 04:06:15.727
WERE SAILORS DEALERS WILLING TO

04:06:15.794 --> 04:06:16.828
ENGAGE IN THESE THESE WERE NOT

04:06:16.895 --> 04:06:18.396
LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT BUT BACK

04:06:18.463 --> 04:06:19.831
NAY JUST GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT

04:06:19.898 --> 04:06:21.133
INTO WHAT'S HAPPENING THAT

04:06:21.199 --> 04:06:24.569
INCLUDED VENTURA. AND MY

04:06:24.636 --> 04:06:26.104
GROUNDS IN ORANGE COUNTY. SO

04:06:26.171 --> 04:06:27.539
AGAIN I WILL TELL YOU WE DON'T

04:06:27.606 --> 04:06:28.907
HAVE DATA ANALYST OF BECAUSE

04:06:28.974 --> 04:06:30.842
IT'S TOUGH TO FIND DATA. YOU'RE

04:06:30.909 --> 04:06:31.810
TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S

04:06:31.877 --> 04:06:32.544
ILLEGAL THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT

04:06:32.611 --> 04:06:33.778
GOING TO REPORT GREAT SO THE

04:06:33.845 --> 04:06:35.247
REASON I WAS ASKING IS BECAUSE

04:06:35.313 --> 04:06:37.015
THAT THERE'S INDUSTRIES THAT

04:06:37.082 --> 04:06:38.483
HAVE WHAT THEY CALL SHOPPERS

04:06:38.550 --> 04:06:40.218
WHO GO UNDERCOVER TO SEE

04:06:40.285 --> 04:06:41.820
WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE ARE

04:06:41.887 --> 04:06:43.655
FALLING RULES ARE BEING. AT

04:06:43.722 --> 04:06:45.957
SERVE LIKE THE M. SELLING.

04:06:46.024 --> 04:06:48.426
CIGARETTES TO MINORS OR ALCOHOL

04:06:48.493 --> 04:06:49.961
TO MINORS SO THERE'S UNDER

04:06:50.028 --> 04:06:51.463
COVER. SO I'M JUST KIND OF

04:06:51.530 --> 04:06:52.831
CURIOUS IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

04:06:52.898 --> 04:06:54.900
AND- IT COULD BE CORRECTED ON

04:06:54.966 --> 04:06:55.834
THIS BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

04:06:55.901 --> 04:06:56.935
THAT THEY DO THE SAME THING AT

04:06:57.002 --> 04:06:58.537
GUN SHOWS AND I'M NOT SURE

04:06:58.603 --> 04:07:01.473
THAT. ANYONE WITH THE WITH THE

04:07:01.540 --> 04:07:02.908
NOTION OF HAVING A BUSINESS AND

04:07:02.974 --> 04:07:04.075
BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THE ONE

04:07:04.142 --> 04:07:06.645
SOUTH. WOULD PURPOSELY BREAK

04:07:06.711 --> 04:07:09.848
THE LAW- IN THAT ENDEAVOR- JUST

04:07:09.915 --> 04:07:10.649
SO HAT THEY CAN LOSE THEIR

04:07:10.715 --> 04:07:12.884
LIVES. I'M THINKING AS A REAL

04:07:12.951 --> 04:07:15.020
ESTATE LICENSE- THAT. REALTOR

04:07:15.086 --> 04:07:18.223
BEFORE I WOULDN'T. DO SOMETHING

04:07:18.290 --> 04:07:21.159
ILLEGAL. AND RISK YOU KNOW THE

04:07:21.226 --> 04:07:23.595
ABILITY TO PROVIDE FOR ME. FOR

04:07:23.662 --> 04:07:27.065
MYSELF FOR MY FAMILY. AND SO

04:07:27.132 --> 04:07:27.899
I'M JUST THINKING OF. GUN

04:07:27.966 --> 04:07:30.402
OWNERS AND- PEOPLE WHO WHO SELL

04:07:30.468 --> 04:07:33.405
GUNS. I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE

04:07:33.471 --> 04:07:35.340
OUT IF THEY WOULD PURPOSELY.

04:07:35.407 --> 04:07:37.709
SELLS GUNS NOT FOLLOWING THE

04:07:37.776 --> 04:07:38.743
PROTOCOL THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED

04:07:38.810 --> 04:07:40.312
TO BE FALL I WILL CONFESS TO

04:07:40.378 --> 04:07:41.980
I'VE NEVER BEEN INVOLVED IN THE

04:07:42.047 --> 04:07:45.984
ILLEGAL OR ATTEMPTED AND- TALE

04:07:46.051 --> 04:07:47.552
TOLD IS THAT THERE'S TWO TYPES

04:07:47.619 --> 04:07:48.887
OF TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE

04:07:48.954 --> 04:07:49.854
PROBLEMATIC AND KEEP IN MIND

04:07:49.921 --> 04:07:51.423
WE'RE IN THE ERA OF ANIMAL PAY

04:07:51.489 --> 04:07:53.592
PAL. YOU KNOW A WHOLE BUNCH OF

04:07:53.658 --> 04:07:54.859
WAYS YOU KNOW BIG COIN

04:07:54.926 --> 04:07:56.761
CRYPTOCURRENCY I DON'T WANT TO

04:07:56.828 --> 04:07:58.730
WASTE TO TRANSFER MONEY- AND

04:07:58.797 --> 04:08:01.466
CREATE TRANSACTIONS- YOU KNOW

04:08:01.533 --> 04:08:03.635
THAT THAT GO UNDETECTED- BUT MY

04:08:03.702 --> 04:08:04.736
UNDERSTANDING IS YOU HAVE SOME

04:08:04.803 --> 04:08:06.238
OF THE UNSCRUPULOUS DEALERS AND

04:08:06.304 --> 04:08:07.239
I DON'T KNOW THEIR MOTIVATIONS

04:08:07.305 --> 04:08:08.673
IF THERE MAYBE. I DON'T KNOW

04:08:08.740 --> 04:08:09.774
HOW ROBUST THE UNDERCOVER

04:08:09.841 --> 04:08:10.942
POLICE PRESENCES MAYBE THERE'S

04:08:11.009 --> 04:08:11.843
NOT THAT WORRIED ABOUT BEING

04:08:11.910 --> 04:08:13.178
CAUGHT. AND THEN THERE'S ALSO

04:08:13.245 --> 04:08:14.246
JUST PEOPLE WHO GO TO THESE

04:08:14.312 --> 04:08:16.314
THINGS YOU KNOW IN IN YOU KNOW

04:08:16.381 --> 04:08:17.582
JUST GO OUT IN THE OFFICE

04:08:17.649 --> 04:08:19.217
PEOPLE TALKING ENGAGING WITH

04:08:19.284 --> 04:08:21.419
EACH OTHER- AND HAVING THAT

04:08:21.486 --> 04:08:23.788
TYPE OF SECONDARY TRANSACTION.

04:08:23.855 --> 04:08:25.023
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE

04:08:25.090 --> 04:08:26.224
LICENSED DEALERS THAT THAT'S

04:08:26.291 --> 04:08:27.292
KIND OF MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE

04:08:27.359 --> 04:08:28.360
TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS THAT

04:08:28.426 --> 04:08:30.262
OCCUR. BUT I WOULD EMPHASIZE AS

04:08:30.328 --> 04:08:31.796
I SAID EARLIER IN MY OPENING

04:08:31.863 --> 04:08:34.232
EVEN IF WE HAD ZERO ILLEGAL

04:08:34.299 --> 04:08:35.100
TRANSACTIONS SO WE COULD GET IT

04:08:35.166 --> 04:08:37.335
TO THAT POINT. I STILL THINK

04:08:37.402 --> 04:08:38.270
THERE'S A GENERAL PRINCIPLE

04:08:38.336 --> 04:08:40.238
HERE. WE HAVE AND MY

04:08:40.305 --> 04:08:41.940
UNDERSTANDING SOMETHING LIKE A

04:08:42.007 --> 04:08:43.575
HUNDRED TWENTY GUNS PER HUNDRED

04:08:43.642 --> 04:08:45.543
PEOPLE ADULTS IN THIS COUNTRY-

04:08:45.610 --> 04:08:46.811
THAT TO ME IS YOU KNOW IT'S

04:08:46.878 --> 04:08:48.246
EXPONENTIALLY HIGHER THAN ANY

04:08:48.313 --> 04:08:49.648
OTHER COUNTRY I THINK THE NEXT

04:08:49.714 --> 04:08:51.650
CLOSEST IS LIKE THIRTY GUNS PER

04:08:51.716 --> 04:08:53.151
HUNDRED PEOPLE. OUT WE HAVE AN

04:08:53.218 --> 04:08:55.186
EPIDEMIC OF GUNS AND NOT

04:08:55.253 --> 04:08:56.988
WITHSTANDING THE FAKE STUDIES

04:08:57.055 --> 04:08:58.590
OUT THERE WHAT'S VERY CLEAR IS

04:08:58.657 --> 04:09:00.091
MORE GUNS AS YOU WOULD EXPECT

04:09:00.158 --> 04:09:01.459
LEAD TO MORE GUN VIOLENCE MORE

04:09:01.526 --> 04:09:02.661
GUN HOMICIDES MORE GUN

04:09:02.727 --> 04:09:05.430
INJURIES. MORE SUICIDES MORE

04:09:05.497 --> 04:09:07.365
CRIME TO. ANSWER AS MUCH AS WE

04:09:07.432 --> 04:09:09.401
ALL LIKE TO THINK I HAVE A GUN

04:09:09.467 --> 04:09:09.968
I'M GONNA BE ABLE STOP THE

04:09:10.035 --> 04:09:11.202
CRIMINAL. YOU KNOW I HAD

04:09:11.269 --> 04:09:12.304
SOMEONE TELL ME THE OTHER DAY

04:09:12.370 --> 04:09:14.039
THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM

04:09:14.105 --> 04:09:15.006
SHOULD GET GUNS TO PROTECT

04:09:15.073 --> 04:09:16.374
THEMSELVES AND IT'S SOMEONE

04:09:16.441 --> 04:09:18.043
WHOSE WIFE WORKS IN A CERVANTES

04:09:18.109 --> 04:09:19.744
THINKING THAT'S INSANE. YOU

04:09:19.811 --> 04:09:20.612
KNOW BECAUSE THE FIRST THING

04:09:20.679 --> 04:09:21.813
YOU SAID WOULD DO IS TAKE YOUR

04:09:21.880 --> 04:09:24.215
GUN FROM YOU AND USE IT AGAINST

04:09:24.282 --> 04:09:26.551
YOU- AND GUNS IN A DOMESTICALLY

04:09:26.618 --> 04:09:28.687
ABUSIVE HOUSEHOLD ARE A TOTALLY

04:09:28.753 --> 04:09:30.055
CORRELATED THING WITH WITH THE

04:09:30.121 --> 04:09:32.390
LIKELIHOOD OF GUN. DEATHS AND

04:09:32.457 --> 04:09:33.958
SO I THINK THERE'S A PRINCIPLE

04:09:34.025 --> 04:09:35.994
HERE THAT. I RESPECTFULLY

04:09:36.061 --> 04:09:37.962

AND I DO ALSO WANT TO STATE.

04:10:19.104 --> 04:10:20.372
EVER HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH

BETWEEN GUNS SOLD AT GUN SHOWS

04:12:24.996 --> 04:12:26.831

THIS PROBLEM IS BECAUSE

YES EXPERIENCE MATTERS BY BEING

A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER ISN'T

04:53:19.515 --> 04:53:21.216
THE ONLY KIND OF EXPERIENCE I

04:53:21.283 --> 04:53:25.287
COULD SET YOU OUGHT. TO BE- A-

04:53:25.354 --> 04:53:27.022
YOU KNOW A SHERIFF AND YES

04:53:27.089 --> 04:53:28.958
THERE ARE SOME POSITIONS THAT

04:53:29.024 --> 04:53:31.026
HAVE REQUIREMENTS. BUT YOUR

04:53:31.093 --> 04:53:32.695
SHERIFF IS A POWERFUL POSITION

YOU KNOW WE COULD MAKE A

04:53:34.096 --> 04:53:35.798

IT'S GREAT TO HAVE FORMER

04:53:50.779 --> 04:53:51.480
LEGISLATIVE AIDES IN THE

04:53:51.547 --> 04:53:53.148

AND THAT LEADS TO GOOD

04:53:57.419 --> 04:54:00.189
OUTCOMES. AND SO WE YOU KNOW I

04:54:00.255 --> 04:54:01.623
IN THE SAME IS TRUE THIS IS A

04:54:01.690 --> 04:54:04.360
MAJOR POSITION- WE DESERVE TO

04:54:04.426 --> 04:54:07.863

CENTER CENTER. THANK YOU ARE

04:54:20.009 --> 04:54:23.645
CHAIR- SENATOR WIENER I'M

04:54:23.712 --> 04:54:24.213
PREACHED OF THAT YOU BROUGHT

04:54:24.279 --> 04:54:26.915
THIS BILL AND I THINK WHILE THE

04:54:26.982 --> 04:54:29.618
POINTS MADE BY CERTAIN OF THE

04:54:29.685 --> 04:54:32.755
OPPONENTS WITH CONCERN-

04:54:32.821 --> 04:54:36.191
REGARDING THE- YOU KNOW THAT.

04:54:36.258 --> 04:54:37.726
SOMEHOW IT'S DOWNGRADING THE

04:54:37.793 --> 04:54:39.862
POSITION I THINK YOUR REFERENCE

04:54:39.928 --> 04:54:42.998
TO THE FACT THAT. DEAR THE

04:54:43.065 --> 04:54:45.067
SHERIFF IN SEARCHES GO FOR WHOM

04:54:45.134 --> 04:54:47.202
THIS BILL. WHAT I MEAN THE

04:54:47.269 --> 04:54:48.871
REASON THAT WE HAVE THE

04:54:48.937 --> 04:54:51.707
REQUIREMENT OF A PEACE OFFICER

04:54:51.774 --> 04:54:54.076
TO BE A SHERIFF WAS DUE TO

04:54:54.143 --> 04:54:56.612
MISTER HENNESSY SELECTION AND

04:54:56.678 --> 04:55:01.083
THEN. HIS SERVICE OVER DECADES

04:55:01.150 --> 04:55:03.552
WHICH WAS THEN SUPPORTED BY LAW

04:55:03.619 --> 04:55:06.288
ENFORCEMENT GROUPS ACROSS THE

04:55:06.355 --> 04:55:10.993
STATE SO- IT'S- AND YOU ALSO

04:55:11.060 --> 04:55:13.062
MADE THE POINT JUST NOW ABOUT

04:55:13.128 --> 04:55:15.831
THAT YOU THAT THERE'S ALL KINDS

04:55:15.898 --> 04:55:17.633
OF DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF LAW

04:55:17.699 --> 04:55:19.101
ENFORCEMENT AND THOSE

04:55:19.168 --> 04:55:21.170
CATEGORIES DON'T NECESSARILY

04:55:21.236 --> 04:55:23.972
EQUATE TO HAVING THE SKILL SET

04:55:24.039 --> 04:55:24.940
THAT MANY OF THE OPPONENTS

04:55:25.007 --> 04:55:28.277
RAISED WAS NECESSARY IN ORDER

04:55:28.343 --> 04:55:30.446
TO BE A SHERIFF. SO I THINK THE

04:55:30.512 --> 04:55:32.414
KEY THING THAT THIS DOES IS

04:55:32.481 --> 04:55:34.883
GIVE COUNTY TO CHOICE CLEARLY

04:55:34.950 --> 04:55:36.385
DID FOR BY PREDOMINATE

04:55:36.452 --> 04:55:38.520
CANDIDATES WILL CONTINUE TO BE

04:55:38.587 --> 04:55:41.623
LAW ENFORCEMENT EVEN IF WE ARE

04:55:41.690 --> 04:55:43.025
SUCCESSFUL WITH THE STATUTE.

04:55:43.092 --> 04:55:43.892
BECAUSE THERE WILL BE MANY

04:55:43.959 --> 04:55:45.861
COUNTIES THE PREFERRED THAT BUT

04:55:45.928 --> 04:55:47.796
FOR THOSE COUNTIES FOR WHOM

04:55:47.863 --> 04:55:50.232
